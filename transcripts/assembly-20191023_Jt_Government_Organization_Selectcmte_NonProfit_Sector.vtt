AND I MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:41.353
HAS THE SAME RESOURCES THAT

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.188
THEY NEED. IN ORDER TO SERVE

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:45.057
THE CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE BEING

00:18:45.123 --> 00:18:46.925
AFFECTED BY THE DISASTER. SO

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:49.094
THAT'S THAT'S MY ROLE IN A VERY

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:53.265
SMALL NOT SHOW. BUT I THOUGHT I

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:55.000
WOULD GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:57.035
HOW I HAVE- WORKED ON SOME OF

00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:59.238
THE DISASTERS THAT WE'VE HAD IN

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:00.939
HOW THAT COORDINATION ROLE

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:04.943
HAPPENS AND THE VALUE OF IT. IN

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.845
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD THE-

00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:09.014
LARGE NORTH BAY FIRES UP IN

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.949
CINEMA COUNTY. AND AT THE SAME

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:12.985
TIME THAT WE HAD- THE FIRED THE

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:16.989
THOMAS FIRE DOWN HERE. AS WELL

00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:20.893
AS A FEW OTHER FIRES AND- I

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:21.527
BELIEVE IS ORANGE COUNTY. A IT

00:19:21.593 --> 00:19:24.897
WAS A MASSIVE EFFORT AND IT WAS

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:27.299
REALLY TAXING ON ALL OF OUR NON

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:29.334
PROFITS UP AND DOWN THE STATE.

00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:31.270
AND THEY WERE DOING EVERYTHING

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:33.105
THAT THEY COULD AND SOME OF

00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:36.909
THESE NONPROFITS ARE- MASTERS

00:19:36.975 --> 00:19:38.877
AT THEIR CRAFT. WHEN IT COMES

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.946
TO SHELTERING YOU GET OUT OF

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.015
THE WAY WHEN A FOR THE RED

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:44.750
CROSS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY-

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:46.852
HAVE WHAT THEY DO BUT YOU JUST

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:47.419
GET OUT OF THEIR WAY AND LET

00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:48.854
THEM DO THEIR JOB. SAME COMES

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:50.789
FOR FEEDING YOU KNOW WE HAVE. A

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.958
WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN WE HAVE

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:54.793
THE- ADVENTIST WE HAVE A

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.929
SOUTHERN BAPTIST. ALL THESE

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.864
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:19:58.931 --> 00:19:59.398
THEY ARE EXPERTS AT MASS

00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:01.033
FEEDING. AND SO WE GET OUT OF

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:04.870
THE WAY NOW AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:07.039
DURING A DISASTER. EVERYBODY

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:09.341
ELSE WANTS TO HELP AND SO THEY

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:11.076
COME TO US AND THINK HOW DO WE

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:14.980
HELP HOW DO WE HELP. ONE OF THE

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:21.453
BIG ONES THAT WE HAD THAT CAME

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.020
TO US GOOGLE. AND WAS A. A

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:25.190
GRAND ME FOR CALIFORNIA AND WE

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:27.125
TALK TO THEM ABOUT. A MONETARY

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:28.827
DONATION THAT'S ALWAYS FAST AND

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:29.494
SO WE WERE ABLE TO SEND THEM TO

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:29.995
WHERE THEY NEEDED TO GO

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.063
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WENT TO THE

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:31.697
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:33.265
IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:34.900
BEING AFFECTED. NORTHERN AND

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:37.102
SOUTHERN- WITHIN THEIR LIKE WE

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:38.904
WANT TO DO SOMETHING WANT TO DO

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:40.973
SOMETHING. THEY HAVE A FLEET OF

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:45.010
FOOD TRUCKS FANCY FOOD TRUCKS

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:45.577
BECAUSE THEY FEED ALL THEIR

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:48.947
GOOGLE LORS EVERY DAY. AND THEY

00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:49.548
WANTED TO GIVE THEM AND SEND

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:52.851
THEM TO THE SHELTERS. THAT'S A

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:53.418
BIG NO NO. I'M LOOKING AT IT

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:56.922
GOING. I WOULD BE GREAT I THINK

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:58.757
THE SURVIVORS WOULD LOVE IT

00:20:58.824 --> 00:21:01.026
BECAUSE THAT'S COOL RIGHT YOU

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:01.660
KNOW OKAY I HAVE TO DEAL WITH

00:21:01.727 --> 00:21:02.961
SOMETHING AT LEAST I. HAVE A

00:21:03.028 --> 00:21:05.130
COOL MEAL FROM A GOOGLE FOOD

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:07.099
TRUCK. BUT IT'S- ALL OF OUR NON

00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:09.234
PROFITS ARE ALREADY THERE

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:12.838
PLANNING THIS ALL OUT. FIGURING

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:13.472
OUT HOW TO DO THE MEALS HOW DO

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:15.007
FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOW TO

00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:16.575
DO THIS HAVE TO DO THAT THEY'VE

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:18.810
GOT THE SUPPLIES. AND IF WE

00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:19.344
BROUGHT IN A BUNCH OF FOOD

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:19.911
TRUCKS ALL THAT WOULD DO IS

00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:21.279
MESS THEM UP THE LAST THING WE

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:23.115
WANTED TO DO. AND SO WHAT MARK

00:21:23.181 --> 00:21:25.217
MY STAFF AND I WE HAD TO GET

00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:26.918
CREATIVE AND THINK WELL HOW DO

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:28.920
WE DO THIS WHAT WE DO. SO WHAT

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:30.889
WE ENDED UP DOING WAS SENDING

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:31.490
THE FOOD TRUCKS TO THE LOCAL

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.824
ASSISTANCE CENTERS. WHEN PEOPLE

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:35.093
WERE STANDING IN LINE TO GET

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.895
THEIR SERVICES AND TO TALK TO

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.031
THEIR INSURANCE PEOPLE INTO THE

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:40.932
COUNTY FOLKS. THEY COULD HAVE A

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:43.035
FREE MEAL IF THEY WANTED TO

00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:43.702
FROM THE GOODWILL TRUCKS AND SO

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:44.870
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A WIN WIN.

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:47.172
BUT THAT'S WHY THE IMPORTANCE

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:49.074
OF MY OFFICE IS TO STOP THAT

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:51.243
KIND OF A MESS BECAUSE ALL THAT

00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:53.011
WOULD HAVE DONE IS MAKE A

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:55.180
HEARTACHE FOR THE NON PROFITS

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:56.915
THAT WORK SO TIRELESSLY. TO DO

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:59.117
WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO THAT

00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:00.786
THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE'RE

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:03.288
ABLE TO. COORDINATE THAT EFFORT

00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:05.023
BECAUSE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.692
WHERE WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:08.894
THAT'S GOING ON. AND WHAT'S

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.796
HAPPENING AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:22:10.862 --> 00:22:12.864
THE BEST IS THERE. SO ONE OTHER

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:14.800
THING I WANTED TO MENTION ABOUT

00:22:14.866 --> 00:22:18.904
CALLOW YES THAT'S BEYOND ME. IS

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:19.504
WE HAVE AN AMAZING TEAM THAT'S

00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:23.008
GRANTS MANAGEMENT. AND WE

00:22:23.075 --> 00:22:23.608

00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:24.242
GRANTS AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:25.177
GRANTS FOR THE STATE OF

00:22:25.243 --> 00:22:25.744
CALIFORNIA AND THEN WE TURN

00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:27.212
AROUND. AND HAND THOSE OUT.

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:29.281
BASED TO THE LEVEL OF LOCAL

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:31.149
COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW WE SO THEY

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:33.151
CAN BY FIRE TRUCKS THEY CAN BY

00:22:33.218 --> 00:22:33.752
POLICE CARS THEY CAN DO ALL

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:36.888
THAT KIND OF- PUBLIC SAFETY

00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:38.824
THINGS. BUT ALSO PART OF THAT

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:39.291
IS WE HAVE THE VICTIMS

00:22:39.357 --> 00:22:41.026
COMPENSATION. AND THE- VICTIM

OUR NON PROFITS FOR THAT IT'S A

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:48.900
VERY IMPORTANT THING TO DO-

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:30.841
VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION ACTIVE

KNOW EACH OTHER AND AS EXIT A

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:40.884
GREAT EXAMPLE IN BUTTE THEY

DIDN'T HAVE A BOW OUT SET UP.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.322

OTHER BEFORE THE INCIDENT. THAT

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.046

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:12.816
A REALLY SOUND ONE- AND IT

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:15.552
MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT ALL

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:34.705
UP AND THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:35.339

THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.850
EVERYONE TO PARTICIPATE. AND SO

00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:48.986
WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS THROUGH

00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:50.888
OUR DIFFERENT LAYERS OF

00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:52.890
CONNECTIONS WITH THE VOEPEL WE

TRY TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:03.133
TRY TO HELP AND ASSIST THE

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.937
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS THEY DO.

00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:07.504

00:45:13.077 --> 00:45:17.081
COMMUNITY- IT'S DIFFICULT

00:45:17.147 --> 00:45:20.984
DURING STEADY STATE BUT. WE'LL

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:23.153
DO NOT HAVE- THEY DON'T HAVE TO

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.089
GO FAR BACK TO THINK ABOUT WHEN

00:45:25.155 --> 00:45:25.689
THE LAST DISASTER WAS. AND SO

00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:27.024
THEY'RE OFTEN WILLING TO COME

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:27.624
IN AND SO THAT THAT'S KIND OF

00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:28.992
HOW WE COORDINATE BUT- EVERY

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:31.228
DISASTERS DIFFERENT AND SO THEY

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:33.297
ALL. A CHAMPIONS AND LEADERS

00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:37.000
WILL RISE OUT OF A DISASTER AND

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:37.634
IT WE GRAB THEM AND PUT THEM TO

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:43.073
WORK. THANK YOU. SEVERAL

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:49.279
QUESTIONS. BALDING AS AS WE

00:45:49.346 --> 00:45:53.016
CONTINUE TO TALK. IT IS THE

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:55.085
ADDRESSES IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:58.755
TO STANDARDIZE PRACTICE. AND I

00:45:58.822 --> 00:46:00.724
KNOW THROUGH MY OWN EXPERIENCE-

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:01.358
INVOLVED BUT I STORE MERCED TO

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:03.360
COMMITTEES I REPRESENT A WHICH

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.928
IN TWO DIFFERENT COUNTIES WE

00:46:04.995 --> 00:46:09.433
ARE WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS AND

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.101
TRYING TO THE. THE MOST

00:46:11.168 --> 00:46:14.872
CHALLENGING THING I'VE FOUND IS

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:16.874
GETTING ALL OF THE NON PROFITS

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.709
THAT WORK IN HOMELESSNESS TO

00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:19.209
COORDINATE THE WAY THAT

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:20.777
SUFFICIENT IN A WAY THAT WE'RE

00:46:20.844 --> 00:46:21.345
NOT DUPLICATIVE OF WORK AND

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:23.147
RESOURCES AND SO ON IN AN AREA

00:46:23.213 --> 00:46:25.015
WHERE WE HAVE LIMITED

00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:30.854
RESOURCES. AND IT STRIKES ME.

00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:31.421
YOUR THAT IS CERTAINLY THIS

00:46:31.488 --> 00:46:32.956

COMMERCIALLY CAMPAIGN. WHAT ARE

00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:39.630
THE NEXT STEPS AND WE ESTABLISH

00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:41.131
STANDARDS STRUCTURE THROUGH

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:44.835
THAT WHEN IS THAT PROGRAM-

00:46:44.902 --> 00:46:45.335
COULD BE EXPANDED TO ALL

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:49.206

GOING TO DISASTERS ARE GREAT

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:58.782
QUESTIONS- I KNOW WHEN I WAS

00:46:58.849 --> 00:46:59.316
FORMERLY THE CHIEF SERVICE

00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:01.051
OFFICER CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS

IN CHARGE OF AMERICORPS

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:05.055
VOLUNTEERS AND DONATIONS FOR

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:05.656
DISASTERS ONE OF THE THINGS

00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:09.092
THAT SURPRISED ME COMING INTO

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:09.693
THE JOB IS THAT I THOUGHT IT

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.961
WOULD BE LIKE A CHAMBER OF

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:11.461
COMMERCE THAT WOULD HAVE

00:47:11.528 --> 00:47:13.130
INDUSTRY GROUP INFORMATION

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:15.165
ABOUT LIKE ALL THE NON PROFITS

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:16.867
IN THE HOMELESS ARENA ALL THE

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:18.802
NONPROFIT. DOING TUTORING IN

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:20.904
EDUCATION LIKE THAT THAT WOULD

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:22.839
BE AN ASSET THAT THE STATE MUST

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:25.209
BE TRACKING AND ONLY TO FIND

00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:28.845
OUT THERE WAS NO SUCH DOCUMENTS.

00:47:28.912 --> 00:47:30.981
AND THERE ARE ASSOCIATION FOR

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:34.851
SOME NONPROFIT KIND OF INDUSTRY

00:47:34.918 --> 00:47:35.419
GROUPS FOR LACK OF A BETTER

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:37.120
TERM. BUT BUT THERE ISN'T

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:39.056
ANYTHING THAT I KNOW OF THAT IS

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:41.258
FORMALLY SET UP ACROSS TO ALL

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:43.060
ISSUES. SO YOU'VE GOT THAT KIND

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:46.763
OF COMPLICATION- AND SECONDLY

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.066
AS FAR AS THEY'RE THE KIND OF

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:50.767
THE GROWTH EXPANSION OF LEAST

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:51.235
US I MEAN. REACHING A

00:47:51.301 --> 00:47:53.203
CONCENTRATE TWENTY FOUR

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:55.138
COUNTIES. WILL BE ARE ARE KIND

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:58.742
OF. WHAT I HOPE WILL BE PHASE

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:01.044
ONE. WE LOOK AT THOSE RESULTS

00:48:01.111 --> 00:48:01.612
RIGHT WE SEE THE STRATEGIES

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:03.247
THAT WE TRY AND THEY ARE ALL

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:06.984
BEING CAPTURED IN REPORTS- AND

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:09.019
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- WE ARE

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:09.586
HOPING TO COME BACK TO THIS

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:11.121
COMMITTEE AND BE ABLE TO GIVE

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:13.023
YOU UPDATES ON. OUR OUR

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.392
PROGRESS AND MY HOPE IS THAT IF

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:16.827
IT DOES PROVE TO BE AS

00:48:16.893 --> 00:48:17.427
EFFECTIVE IN THIS KIND OF I

00:48:17.494 --> 00:48:18.996
THINK NATION LEADING OF A

00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:21.465
PRACTICE AS I THINK IT IS. I AM

00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:23.133
CONFIDENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.872
WILL LOVE TO EXPAND IT- BUT I

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:29.439
THINK WE DO NEED TO WAIT AND

00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:33.043
SEE HOW IT GOES. DO YOU THINK

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:37.414
THE. AN AUDIT LIKE A STATE

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:39.116
AUDIT AUDIT TO GOING TO LOOK AT

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:43.020
BEST PRACTICES WOULD BE USEFUL.

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:43.620
WELL I IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT

00:48:43.687 --> 00:48:44.855
SPECIFICALLY PREPAREDNESS. BEST

00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:47.090
PRACTICES OR I CAN I CAN LET

00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:49.026
YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE LEASES

00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:50.861
CALIFORNIA PROJECT WE'RE DOING

00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:52.863
A FULL BLOWN INVENTORY IT'S

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:55.232
LIKE AN AUDIT OF ALL OF THE

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:56.933
PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGNS BOTH

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.969
FEDERAL STATE LOCAL. I'M AND

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:00.671
THOSE THAT ARE GEARED TOWARD

00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:02.873
WILD FIRE EARTHQUAKE AND FLOOD

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:03.340
SAID IT CAN INFORM THE

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:05.275
CURRICULUM THAT WE'RE GETTING

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:07.210
OUT THERE. BUT AS FAR AS A AS A

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:09.146
KIND OF AN AUDIT IF YOU'RE

00:49:09.212 --> 00:49:10.981
REFERRING MORE TO THE

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:14.851
POPULATIONS IN THE NONPROFIT. I

00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:17.020
WASN'T SURE WHAT YOU WERE

00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:17.521
REFERRING MORE TO I WAS

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:22.926
SPECIFIC FOR TO THE- OFFERING A

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:23.560
AUDIT LETTER TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:24.161
TO CHURCH OR OTHERS ABOUT IT.

00:49:24.227 --> 00:49:26.897
STATE AUDITOR WHICH OFTENTIMES.

00:49:26.963 --> 00:49:29.199
I FIND AGENCIES- LOOK AT THE

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:31.001
STATE OUR OFFICES CAN OF A

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:33.036
PUNITIVE ACTION. RIGHT WHEN IN

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:34.771
FACT MY VIEW THE SAY OURSELVES

00:49:34.838 --> 00:49:36.940
I USED TO CHAIR THE COMMITTEE

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:39.276
IS THAT WE HAVE THE IMMENSE

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:39.943
ASSET IN THE STATE AUDITOR AND-

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.511
ALL THE EMPLOYEES OVER THERE

00:49:41.578 --> 00:49:43.046
AND THEY LOOK AT. PROGRAMS AND

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:44.881
OF COURSE THEY ACROSS DIFFERENT

00:49:44.948 --> 00:49:45.515
AGENCIES I AM A COME BACK WITH

00:49:45.582 --> 00:49:47.317
JUST TREMENDOUS COMMENDATIONS

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:48.985
TO THE LEGISLATURE IT'S A TOOL

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:52.789
I THINK WE OUGHT TO USE A LOT

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:53.357
MORE. MONIQUE AND I AND OUR

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:55.025
COLLEAGUES- BUT I JUST CURIOUS

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:56.860
IF THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:57.427
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO DO AN

00:49:57.494 --> 00:49:59.096
INTERNAL AUDIT. RIGHT WHAT YOU

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:01.064
CAN DO YOUR PROGRAMS BUT IT'S

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:03.300
HARD TO SOMETIMES GET AFTER THE

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:05.135
RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK MY

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:07.070
FAVORITE. OF IDEA THE WILL THE

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:07.704
ONE THING I TO SPEAK TO IS THAT

00:50:07.771 --> 00:50:09.106
THERE'S- COUNTLESS STATE

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:09.573
AGENCIES ALL THAT HAVE

00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:10.974
PARTNERSHIPS. WITH THE

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:14.811
NONPROFIT COMMUNITY RIGHT-

00:50:14.878 --> 00:50:16.747
DIFFERENT GRANT PROGRAMS SO IF

00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:19.149
THERE WOULD BE A WAY TO KIND OF

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:19.616
CONSOLIDATE ALL THAT

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:22.919
INFORMATION ABOUT THE IDEA I

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:29.226
THINK THAT WOULD. BE REALLY

00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:29.793
INTERESTING. AN INTERESTING

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:33.597
IDEA. SO I ALSO DID WANT TO ADD

00:50:33.663 --> 00:50:35.098
THAT THERE THERE'S WHEN YOU

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:37.200
TALK ABOUT AN ORGANIZATIONAL

00:50:37.267 --> 00:50:39.236
MECHANISM. THERE'S PREPARED AND

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:42.973
THEN THERE'S RESPONSE. FOR

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:43.607
EXAMPLE THE RED CROSS WE DEMO

00:50:43.673 --> 00:50:45.375
YOU WITH CALORIE YES AND THE

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:47.010
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:49.012
THAT OUTLINES WHAT WE ARE GOING

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:50.847
TO DO IN CASE OF A DISASTER.

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:51.448
NOT ONLY UNFUNDED BY THE WAY

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:53.583
NOT ONLY THAT BUT- WE ALSO HAVE

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:55.552
EIGHT THE TASK FORCE STRUCTURE

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:56.186
THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT AT THE

00:50:56.253 --> 00:50:57.154
STATE THAT EXISTS I CAN'T AT

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.156
THE COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:00.857
LEVEL SO THAT IS A REPEATABLE.

00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:03.326
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PRETTY

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:05.195
ESTHER RESPONSE AND THAT WE'RE

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:06.696
REAPING THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:09.566
ORDINATING AT ENTITY WITH I'M

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:10.133
BETTER AT IT IF THEY THERE

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.034
THERE'VE BEEN SOME HICCUPS

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:16.406
ALONG THE WAY. BUT THAT STRONG

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:19.075
COUNTY EMERGENCY MA'AM.

00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:21.311
DISASTERS ALWAYS START LOCALLY.

00:51:21.378 --> 00:51:22.813
IF THE IF THEY FOLLOW THE

00:51:22.879 --> 00:51:25.081
STRUCTURE THAT SET. THEY'LL

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:25.715
HAVE A BLACK REPRESENTATIVE THE

00:51:25.782 --> 00:51:27.384
HAVE A RED CROSS REPRESENTATIVE

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:27.884
THEY'LL HAVE ALL OF THE

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:28.418
AGENCIES IN THE EMERGENCY

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:30.720
OPERATIONS CENTER AND THAT IS

00:51:30.787 --> 00:51:31.288
THE KEY TO COORDINATING THE

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:35.158
DISASTER RESPONSE. YEAH I

00:51:35.225 --> 00:51:36.827
COMPLETELY HERE YOU'RE SAYING

00:51:36.893 --> 00:51:37.461
AT A FOR OUR ORGANIZATION WE'VE

00:51:37.527 --> 00:51:38.962
BEEN AUDITED SOMETHING LIKE

00:51:39.029 --> 00:51:39.529
FIFTY OR SIXTY TIMES IN THE

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:41.198
PAST FIVE YEARS WHEN YOU'RE

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:41.865
DEALING WITH MEDICINE IT'S JUST

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:43.033
UNBELIEVABLE. BUT FOR THE

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:45.068
PURPOSE OF THE AUDIT IS IMPUTED

00:51:45.135 --> 00:51:45.702
VÀ NATURE'S MUCH AS IT'S TO

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:48.738
DEMONSTRATE THE BEST MODELS

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:49.372
THAT EXIST IN WHERE TO SORT OF

00:51:49.439 --> 00:51:51.174
POINT YOURSELF. I TRY TO A FIRE

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:53.143
TO BE HAVE A GOAT'S WANTING MY

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.711
WE FOCUS REALLY HEAVILY ON

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:55.312
COMPLIANCE BUT I THINK RELATED

00:51:55.378 --> 00:51:57.047
TO THAT THESE CONCEPTS AND WHAT

00:51:57.113 --> 00:51:58.915
DID YOU JUST TOUCHED ON I THINK

00:51:58.982 --> 00:52:01.318
WHAT ALBEIT AT THE STATE LEVEL

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:01.885
WITH THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS

00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:04.821
CENTER AT THE TIME TO BE THAT

00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:07.224
PUBLIC PRIVATE WORKING GROUP SO

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:07.824
THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED READ.

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:08.859
ASSET AND ROLES AS AN EMERGENCY

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:09.459
SO THEN YOU HAVE SOME CLARITY

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:11.094
DURING AN EVENT WHO'S DOING

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:12.829
WHAT WHAT ARE THE CAPABILITIES

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:13.430
WHO CAN YOU RELY ON HOW YOU

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:15.165
ACCESS THINGS YOU MAY NOT EVER

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:16.900
HAVE THOUGHT YOU NEEDED. AND

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:17.501
THAT STRUCTURE PROVIDES THAT

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:19.236
AND THEN I KNOW HERE LOCALLY

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:20.637
WITH ARE AWARE PREPARE

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:21.304
INITIATIVE WE REALLY FOCUSED ON

00:52:21.371 --> 00:52:23.073
THAT AS WELL TRYING TO BREAK-

00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:24.975
BRIDGE THOSE- PARTNERSHIPS

00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:28.845
BETWEEN CITY OFFICIALS COUNTY

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:29.446
OFFICIALS AND THEN THE LOCAL

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:31.081
NONPROFITS THROUGH BOW OUT OR

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:32.949
OR OTHER MEANS- AND THEN I

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:34.951
THINK LASTLY IT'S ENSURING FROM

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:35.585
OUR STANDPOINT IS A NONPROFIT

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:36.920
AND I THINK IT. OTHER

00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:39.089
NONPROFITS HERE TRYING TO BE

00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:40.790
VERY GOOD AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:42.959
ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS SO THAT

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:44.828
WHEN AN EMERGENCY HAPPENS YOU

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:47.130
ARE NOT TRYING TO RECREATE WE

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:47.697
ALL YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO DO

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:49.065
THINGS YOU'VE NEVER DONE

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:51.134
BEFORE. YOU HAVE ASSISTING

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:52.969
RELATIONSHIPS NOT THINK COMP

00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:53.503
NOTE COMBINATION OF THOSE

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:55.071
FACTORS ARE GONNA HELP- PROMOTE

00:52:55.138 --> 00:53:01.144
MORE. EFFICIENCY AND GREATER

00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:09.085
ACTIVITY IN RELIEF EFFORTS. I

00:53:09.152 --> 00:53:09.719
HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IN IN

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:10.287
THIS PRESENTATION WE HEARD

00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:11.354
ABOUT TWO ISSUES THAT I THINK

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:12.822
EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY IS- IN

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:14.758
CALIFORNIA. IS GRAPPLING WITH

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:15.325
ONE IS- THE NEED FOR MORE

00:53:15.392 --> 00:53:16.993
MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES AND- IN

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.762
GENERAL THE PARTICULAR ANY TIME

00:53:18.828 --> 00:53:19.362
OF THE DISASTER RESPONSE. AND

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:21.231
THE SECOND ONE IS HOUSING. AT

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:21.865
CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:22.899
TO DO. WHAT YOU'RE SEEN AND

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:24.834
WHAT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT WANT

00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:25.468
TO SEE IN THE FUTURE IN TERMS

00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:27.537
OF NONPROFITS COORDINATING WITH

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:28.905
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR MAYBE

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.740
NOT QUITE MEETING BUT HAVING

00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:33.076
DISCUSSIONS. ABOUT THESE TWO

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:37.080
ISSUES I KNOW THAT. IN THE

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:37.614
LEGISLATURE THOSE ARE NOT

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:38.949
LITTLE ISSUES THOSE ARE REALLY

00:53:39.015 --> 00:53:40.884
BIG ISSUES THAT. EVERY COUNTY

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:41.451
GRAPPLING WITH IN IN A IN A

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:46.957
VERY DIFFICULT WAY. SURE I CAN

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:49.092
SPEAK VERY BROADLY ABOUT THAT

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:51.094
BECAUSE THOSE ARE TWO VERY VERY

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:53.229
BIG ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH IS

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:54.864
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:56.900
I HAVE A MENTAL ANXIETY AND SO

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:59.035
THEREFORE I SEE THE NEED AND I

00:53:59.102 --> 00:54:01.404
CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE SOME OF THE

00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:02.672
TRAUMA THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:05.408
DURING THESE DISASTERS AND SO I

00:54:05.475 --> 00:54:09.512
AM WORKING WITH OUR- HEALTH AND

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:10.113
HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY THE

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.749
NEW SECRETARY ON FORMING SOME

00:54:12.816 --> 00:54:15.185
KIND OF A TASK FORCE FOR CRISIS

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:17.087
COUNSELING. AND BRING PRIVATE

00:54:17.153 --> 00:54:18.755
SECTOR BECAUSE THE PRIVATE

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:19.322
SECTOR YOU KNOW THERE'S ALL

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:20.857
THESE TELEHEALTH THERE'S ALL

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:22.993
THE DOCTORS OUT THERE EVERYBODY

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.761
WANTS TO GIVE BACK BUT SOMEBODY

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:26.930
HAS TO COORDINATE THAT FROM THE

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:29.299
STATE LEVEL AND THEN WE HAVE TO

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:30.767
BRING IN THE NON PROFITS THAT

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:31.434
ARE IN THE COMMUNITY WORKING ON

00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:33.236
IT AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:34.738
THINGS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:36.773

IT'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:46.683
JUST THE RIDGE CREST EARTHQUAKE

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:48.752
THOSE PEOPLE WITH THE HUNDREDS

00:54:48.818 --> 00:54:50.787
OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS

00:54:50.854 --> 00:54:56.826
CONSTANTLY AFTERWARDS. OF. WE

00:54:56.893 --> 00:54:57.460
HAD TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING AND

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:58.762
SO THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:54:58.828 --> 00:54:59.396
WE'RE WORKING ON BUT- AS YOU

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:00.664
KNOW AS AS EVERYONE KNOWS

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:03.133
MENTAL HEALTH HAS. A LONG WAY

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:05.035
TO GO AND- THERE'S A STIGMA

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:05.635
RELATED TO IT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:07.370
BREAK THAT DOWN BECAUSE IT'S

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:09.105
OKAY. TO WANT TO TALK TO

00:55:09.172 --> 00:55:11.074
SOMEBODY AFTER YOU'VE BEEN

00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:13.176
THROUGH A HORRENDOUS OF IT LIKE

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:15.211
THAT. A REGARDING THE HOUSING I

00:55:15.278 --> 00:55:16.846
KNOW THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:19.315
A- MASSIVE PLAN AND IT'S

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:20.917
THROUGH THE BUSINESS CONSUMER

00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:23.987
SERVICES AND HOUSING. AND SO I

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:26.423
AM NOT QUALIFIED TO TALK ABOUT

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:28.191
THAT BUT I DO KNOW IT IS

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:33.697
HAPPENING SO. THE ONLY THING

00:55:33.763 --> 00:55:35.198
I'LL CHIME IN ON- HELP- SOME

00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:37.434
REAL ESTATE INSPIRING MODEL.

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.536
TURNING TO ROLL OUT LIKE KAISER

00:55:39.602 --> 00:55:40.036

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:40.937
CATHOLIC CHARITIES TO EIGHT I'M

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:42.972
A MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID. THAT

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:45.041
YOU CAN BE TRAINED IN. AND THIS

00:55:45.108 --> 00:55:47.110
IS A SPECIAL I THINK IMPORTANT

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:47.677
FOR THOSE IN THE NONPROFIT

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:51.281
FIELD. THAT OFTEN FIND

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:51.915
THEMSELVES IN THE FRONT LINE OF

00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:52.849
WORK. PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:55.318
STRUGGLES AND THEY THEMSELVES

00:55:55.385 --> 00:55:56.986
DON'T REALIZE HOW THE TWO MAY

00:55:57.053 --> 00:56:00.757
BE DEVELOPING. DIFFERENT ISSUE

00:56:00.824 --> 00:56:01.391
IS. THERE IN THIS VERY INTENSE

00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:07.230
ENVIRONMENT. AND. SO I THINK

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:07.797
THERE'S EXCITING MODELS LIKE

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:11.434
THAT OUT THERE AS WELL. AND

00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:13.136
I'LL ADD ON TO THAT WHAT

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:15.138
WORRIES. ME IS WITH THIS EVERY

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:19.008
YEAR THESE LARGE FIRE THESE.

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:19.542
DISASTERS IS THAT THIS IS

00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:20.910
SIMILAR TO. WHAT YOU KNOW WE

00:56:20.977 --> 00:56:21.511
STRUGGLE WITH THIS AND THE RED

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:22.812
CROSS ARE RESPOND OR IS. THE

00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:23.379
ONES THAT RESPONDED TO THE

00:56:23.446 --> 00:56:23.880
CAMPFIRE SOME OF THEM IT

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:25.415
RESPONDED SANTA ROSA THE YEAR

00:56:25.482 --> 00:56:28.918
BEFORE- I DID YOU SEE YOU TODAY

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:32.989
THAT THERE'S A DOCUMENTARY

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:33.556
COMING OUT ON NETFLIX AND I

00:56:33.623 --> 00:56:36.893
WATCHED. THE PREVIEW FOR. FIRE

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:37.494
AND THEY PUT ME RIGHT BACK

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.995
THERE AND I DO THIS FOR A

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:39.662
LIVING- WE NEED TO WE NEED TO

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:41.364
ALL WORK TOGETHER AND TAKE CARE

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:43.133
OF EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN A

00:56:43.199 --> 00:56:45.068
RESPONSIBLE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:47.170
SEE IS THE NEXT TIME THE SKY

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:47.804
TURNS DARK. THE NEXT TIME IT

00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:49.405
FEELS FULL OF SMOKE THERE IS

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:52.842
WIDESPREAD ANXIETY- AND THAT'S

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:53.443
GOING TO BE THE REALITY GOING

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:55.211
FORWARD AND SO ANY KIND OF

00:56:55.278 --> 00:56:56.946
PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN PUT

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.948
TOGETHER. BOB HI MATT I THINK

00:56:59.015 --> 00:56:59.549
WILL MAKE ALL OF OUR RESPONSES

00:56:59.616 --> 00:57:03.119
STRONGER. YEAH I JUST ADD THAT-

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:05.555
IN IN A LOT OF OUR DOMESTIC

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:06.890
RELIEF OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS

00:57:06.956 --> 00:57:08.792
I THINK AGAIN WE RESPONDED TO.

00:57:08.858 --> 00:57:09.325
OUR EVENTS IN THE PAST TWO

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:10.794
YEARS AND PROBABLY THE PAST TEN

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.096
COMBINED- AND THE GROWING NEEDS

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:15.131
ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH I

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:16.766
THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN A

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:17.367
LOT OF MOVEMENT TOWARDS IS A

00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:19.169
RECOGNITION OF THE- THE LONG

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:23.006
TERM EFFECTS OF- MENTAL HEALTH.

00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:23.573
AND ACTUALLY HOW THAT CAN

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.074
AFFECT EVEN CHRONIC DISEASE-

00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:27.310
AND THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:29.012
OF THIS COME OUT- THAT IS OLD

00:57:29.078 --> 00:57:29.646
RESEARCH BUT I THINK IT'S BEING

00:57:29.712 --> 00:57:32.715
REVISITED- RELATED TO TRAUMA

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:34.918
INFORMED CARE. AS AS A MODEL IN

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:35.518
PARTICULAR- THERE'S A LOT OF

00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:36.820
WORK DONE AND THE ACES SPACE

00:57:36.886 --> 00:57:38.955
REGARDING. EVER ADVERSE

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:39.589
CHILDHOOD EVENT AND HOW THOSE A

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:41.057
FACT- HEALTH- RELATED TO TRAUMA

00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:43.193
INFORMED CARE- THEY SAY AFTER

00:57:43.259 --> 00:57:45.128
WITNESSING- SOMEBODY PASSED

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:46.930
AWAY ONE OF THE MOST- SECOND-

00:57:46.996 --> 00:57:49.265
MOST IMPACTFUL THINGS THAT-

00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:52.802
HAPPENED INDIVIDUALS IS- FOR-

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:53.403
TRAUMA IS RELATED TO BEING. A

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:55.371
PART OF OUR IN AN EMERGENCY

00:57:55.438 --> 00:57:56.973
WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE NO

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.175
CONTROL- WE'VE SEEN A BIG

00:57:59.242 --> 00:58:01.044
MOVEMENT IN PORTER RICO TEXAS

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:02.912
AND THEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:05.215

WHERE THEY'RE LOBBING THEIR

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:14.924
STATE LEGISLATURE TO SEE IF

THEY CAN GET COVERAGE. FOR

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:19.062
BILLABLE VISITS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:19.562

TRY TO BRING IN OUR NONPROFIT

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:05.001
PARTNERS TO PRACTICE WITH US.

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:05.635
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.303
EASIEST BECAUSE THEY HAVE DAY

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.871
JOBS THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:10.673
ORGANIZATION RUNNING AND MANY

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.274
OF THEM ARE ON LIKE A SHOE

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:13.076
STRING BUDGET AS IT IS. AND SO

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:15.011
BEING ABLE TO STEP OUT OF THAT

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:16.779
TO PRACTICE THE PREPAREDNESS

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:19.015
BUT WE DO ENCOURAGE IT AND WE

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:19.582
TRY TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:21.117
POSSIBLE FOR THEM. A REGARDING

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:23.219
THE VO ADS AT THE MOMENT

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:26.956
THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH WE ARE

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:27.423
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.691
ORGANIZATIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:31.060
OF SUPPORTING THEM. OUT IT'S A

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:31.661
FINE LINE AND I'VE HAD MANY

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:32.962
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE VOTE

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:34.964
WHETHER LEADERSHIP IN

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:36.833
CALIFORNIA ABOUT IT AS TO HOW

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:38.768
MUCH INPUT FROM THE STATE DO

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.870
THEY ACTUALLY WANT- BECAUSE- WE

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:43.072
LIKE TO KEEP THEM SEPARATE

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:43.573
THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:44.774
NONPROFIT THEY DON'T WANT US

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:45.441
TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO ALL THE

01:00:45.508 --> 01:00:47.310
TIME THEY THEY- DO WHAT THEY DO

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:50.847
BEST- AND SO. BUT AT THE SAME

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:51.481
TIME IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:54.917
HELP THEM BUILD UP THAT SUPPORT

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:56.886
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:58.988
WE'RE WORKING ON. IS AT THE

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:00.923
STATEWIDE LEVEL HAVING-

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:04.694
NONPROFITS BE INJECTED WITH

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:06.963
EITHER CASH OR SUPPORT SERVICES

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.032
FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:10.933
MAKING THOSE CONNECTIONS FOR

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.036
THEM. AND SO IT'S- SOMETHING

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:14.837
THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY WORKING

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:17.173

IS COMING IN. AND TRYING TO

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:24.947
BUILD THAT UP BUT- AS I'M SURE

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:26.916
YOU'RE VERY AWARE. CALIFORNIA

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:28.918
IS VERY DIFFERENT AND VERY

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:31.120
DIVERSE ALL FIFTY EIGHT

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.688

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:38.928

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:46.903

STANDARDIZED ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:53.376

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:59.034
OPPOSITION TO A LOT OF US

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.836
INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES WAS

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:02.938
RIGHT ADVOCACY GROUPS RIGHT-

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:03.438
WHEN YOU GO BACK LOOKED

LIKE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK-

01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:08.877
TURN WHICH LOOKS AFTER-

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.979
RATEPAYERS INTEREST AND I THINK

01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:12.848
THERE'S A LARGER ISSUE AND- ALL

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:13.482
RAISE THIS AND THIS MAY NOT BE

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:15.083
A POPULAR STATEMENT. IN THIS

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:16.718
COMEDIAN THIS CROWD I REPRESENT

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:17.252
CAN INLAND CALIFORNIA I'M

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:19.021
SITTING ON COASTAL CALIFORNIA

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:21.123
BUT- THE REALITY OR UTILITY

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.258
RATES HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:25.160
INCREASES FOR PEOPLE I

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:25.794
REPRESENT BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:29.031
HOT OR COLD CLIMATE RIGHT SO IS

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:31.099
CALIFORNIA'S PURSUED YOUR REAL

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:33.235
LETTER SHE AND ALL OF THE KIND

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:34.903
OF WORTHWHILE GOALS THAT WE SAT

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:37.072
IN MANY CASES AND SHE GREAT

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:39.308
PROGRESS ON. THAT'S COME AT THE

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:39.942
EXPENSE OF SOME OF THE POOREST

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:41.143
PEOPLE IN THE STATE RIGHT IT'S

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:47.015
NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE A TWO

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:47.616
THREE FOUR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:49.084
EACH ANY BILL- AND THEN YOU GO

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.986

YOU KNOW WEALTHY PEOPLE WITH

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:57.125
EIGHTY DOLLAR BILLS- SO IT'S

01:14:57.192 --> 01:14:59.194
NOT BEEN- WITH NOT FOUND A WAY

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:01.463
TO CAN EQUALIZE OUR INVESTMENTS

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:03.232
ACROSS THE STATE FOR A FINANCE

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:03.866
PERSPECTIVE. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:05.234
GOING TO BECOME EVEN MORE

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.835
DIFFICULT WE HAD DISCUSSIONS IN

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.937
THE GEO CAN BE THIS PAST YEAR.

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:16.778
WHEN THE AREAS MOST. AFFECTED

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:18.981
BY THE WILD FIRES WERE LOOKING

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:29.524
TO. FOR TO HELP THESE ERRORS

01:15:29.591 --> 01:15:30.726
BUT I THINK THE ANSWER ALL

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:31.326
THESE QUESTIONS IS THAT WE'RE

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:33.128
ALL GOING TO HAVE TO PITCH IN

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.264
TOGETHER IS A STATE. TOWARDS

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:43.005
YOUR FAIR WAY TO MOVE FORWARD

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:43.605
AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:44.940
ADDRESS SOME OF THE- THE RATE.

01:15:45.007 --> 01:15:47.175
ABBASI OPPOSITION THAT PROBABLY

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:47.776

GROUND IS BASICALLY HAZARDOUS

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:37.079
MATERIAL AND IT'S GOT TO BE DUG

01:18:37.145 --> 01:18:37.679

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:52.994
AN ANSWER I KNOW IT'S

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.996
DEFINITELY BEING TALKED ABOUT.

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:57.499

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:13.148
BY CASE BASIS AND- LIKE DENISE

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:14.983
MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT A

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.650
SHELTER TASK FORCE WE ALSO HAVE

01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:17.352
A HOUSING TASK FORCE BECAUSE

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:20.922
THIS IS A MASSIVE ISSUE ACROSS

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:21.490
THE BOARD BECAUSE WHEN YOUR

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:23.058
HOUSE BURNS DOWN. AND IT'S

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.160
YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR THIRTY

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:25.827
YEARS LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S ALL

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:27.329
THESE NEW REGULATIONS AND NEW

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:28.864
RULES THAT ARE COMMON TO PLACE

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:30.966
WE CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY WAIVE

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:31.566
THOSE BECAUSE WHAT ABOUT THE

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:32.901
PERSON THAT BOUGHT THAT BUILT

THEIR HOUSE THE DAY BEFORE THE

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:36.872
DISASTER AND THEY DIDN'T BURN

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:37.439
THAT'S NOT REALLY FAIR ALL

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:39.274
THAT. ALL THAT FUN STUFF AND SO

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:40.809
WHAT THEY TRY TO DO IS

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:43.612
INDIVIDUALLY HELP AND WALK

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:44.179
THROUGH AND THEY WORK VERY

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:47.048
CLOSELY OF THE HOUSING TASK

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:47.682
FORCE IS MADE UP OF NOT ONLY

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:51.052
STATE FOLKS BUT ALSO THE BULK

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:53.188
OF IT BEING LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:54.923
TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:57.993
CAN ASSIST AND HELP WITH THAT

01:19:58.059 --> 01:19:59.327
AND SO THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:03.131
THINGS THAT WE DO IT IS A HUGE.

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:07.169

THOUSAND HOMES TO FOUR HUNDRED

THINGS THAT ARE TYPICALLY

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:59.621
THOUGHT OF AS THE GOVERNMENT'S

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:01.289

THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:21.776
BUREAUCRACIES. SOMETIMES IT CAN

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:24.946
BE A HUGE CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:25.547

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:29.450
THAT THE GOVERNMENT ARE YOUR

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:31.419
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ALL OF OUR

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:32.987
GOVERNMENTS ARE PEOPLE AND

01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:36.824
THEIR PEOPLE WORKING HARD. AND

01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:37.392
FOLLOWING MANY PEOPLE BEFORE

AND- THAT IN IN OUR OPERATION

01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:45.700
AND GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:47.268
WERE OFTEN TAUGHT. THAT BY THE

01:26:47.335 --> 01:26:49.504
TIME YOU ENTER YOUR GOVERNMENT

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:51.172

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:53.308

ETHICAL WAY. AND THE EASY

01:26:59.314 --> 01:26:59.781

01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:01.015
POLICIES A LOT OF REGULATIONS

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:03.318

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:05.119
EMERGENCY IT'S HARD TO THINK

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:07.255
OUTSIDE THE BOX AND RECOGNIZE.

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:10.825

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:13.294
OF THE KEY FUNDAMENTAL THINGS

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:45.293
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.362
OF MY PIECES OF THAT IS FOR US

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:47.895

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:51.165
LISTEN. MEANS LISTENING. TO

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:54.669
CRITICISMS SOMETIMES MAYBE

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:55.203
THEY'LL COME IN COMMITTEE

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:55.770

THE DAILY DISASTER OF ANGER BUT

01:55:56.916 --> 01:55:57.450
WHAT ABOUT WHEN THERE IS- AND

01:55:57.517 --> 01:56:00.853
THIS IS AN IMMEDIATE DISASTER

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:01.487

DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PARTS OF

02:10:47.539 --> 02:10:48.941
THOSE COUNTIES THEY DO COME

02:10:49.007 --> 02:10:51.176

INITIATIVES. I THINK LEVERAGES

02:10:55.047 --> 02:10:56.848
SOME OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS

02:10:56.915 --> 02:10:57.482

SYSTEM FOR COORDINATION AND

02:12:51.096 --> 02:12:51.563
THAT THE INCIDENT COMMAND

02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:53.198
SYSTEM DEVELOPED OUT OF THAT

02:12:53.265 --> 02:12:55.300

02:12:55.367 --> 02:12:56.935
DISASTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS

02:12:57.002 --> 02:12:59.071
A REALLY HIGH LEVEL OF

COOPERATION AND COORDINATION IN

02:13:01.006 --> 02:13:03.308

AND AS CLIMATE CHANGE INCREASES

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:29.067
THE THREAT MATRIX AND THE

02:13:29.134 --> 02:13:30.936
FREQUENCY AND SCOPE OF THE

02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:33.238

BUT THE- THE- SO MUCH OF IT IS

02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:07.272

TWO ONE ONE IS REALLY- A

02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:16.855
BRILLIANT SOLUTION FOR KNITTING

AND THEN ALSO A DISASTER SO

02:18:39.144 --> 02:18:40.945
THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD

02:18:41.012 --> 02:18:43.081
BE THINKING ABOUT. A SEPARATE

02:18:43.148 --> 02:18:45.050

WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO HOWEVER

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.863
IS TO REALLY. LINK PEOPLE WITH

02:18:58.930 --> 02:19:01.132
THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED IN

02:19:01.199 --> 02:19:03.234
