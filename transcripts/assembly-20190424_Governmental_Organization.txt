FOURTEEN NINETY NINE WHICH WOULD CREATE A GRANT PROGRAM IN THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO MAKE EMERGENCY INTER OPERABILITY SYSTEM FUNDING AVAILABLE. TO K. THROUGH TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND STATE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES. AS WE ALL KNOW THE ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENTS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES ARE INCREASING AT AN ALARMING RATE. IN FACT IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AN ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENT OCCURRING ONCE EVERY FIVE DAYS ON A K. THROUGH TWELVE CAMPUS. AND ONCE EVERY EIGHT DAYS ON THE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. IN OPERABILITY TECHNOLOGY ALLOW OUR SCHOOL STAFF. TO PRESS A SOFT PANIC BUTTON ON THEIR CELL PHONE. AND GIVE ALL LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS THE MEDIA VIDEO AND AUDIO ACCESS TO THE CRISIS AT HAND. THIS ACCESS WOULD ENHANCE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY QUICKLY CONTROL THE MATTER IN AN EFFORT TO MINIMIZE CASUALTIES. AB NINETY I'M SORRY A. B. FOURTEEN NINETY NINE IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO SAVE STUDENTS LIVES IN CALIFORNIA. NOT ONLY FROM ACTIVE SHOOTERS BUT FROM ANY POTENTIAL HARM TO MAKE COME THEIR WAY WHILE AT SCHOOL COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUST FORTY S. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. YES MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN LEVEL I'M REPRESENTING THE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS IN CALIFORNIA PROTECT ABOUT THREE MILLION PEOPLE STUDENTS AND THE STAFF OF THE CAMPUS IS THEIR SWORN TO PROTECT. AND WHAT THEY'VE DISCOVERED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS BEEN AN ALARMING INCREASE. IN ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENTS AS MR FLORA -- INDICATED THE THERE IS A THESE ARE NATIONWIDE STATS. THERE IS A SHOOTING ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS ONCE EVERY EIGHT DAYS THAT'S A VERY DISTURBING NORMALIZATION. SO WE'VE STRUGGLED WITH THIS ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS -- AND ONLY THIS YEAR HAVE WE COME -- INVOLVED WITH THE INTER OPERABILITY CONCEPT WHICH IS EMBODIED IN THIS BILL AND TRULY AN EXCITING. PROBLEM SOLVING CONCEPT -- WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY YES. YES I'M RYAN BROOKS AND AS FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS AS A POLICE OFFICER CALIFORNIA -- RETIRES THIS IS THE CHIEF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND THEN RAN THE THE CALIFORNIA REGIONAL TALK TO CENTER IN SERVICES GROUP COVERING THE COUNTIES FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO NORTH OF THE OREGON BORDER. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE TRY TO SOLVE IS HOW WE BETTER INTEROP -- SINCE NINE ELEVEN SINCE THE NINE ELEVEN COMMISSION REPORT -- CALLED OUT THE PROBLEM OF INTER OPERABILITY -- I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE IN AMERICA BELIEVE THAT WE SOLVE THAT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY FOR POLICE FOR FIRE. FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY SAID FOR EMS. BUT THE REALITY IS WE HAVEN'T -- THE REALITY IS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW POCKETS. LIKE NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK IN CENTRAL FLORIDA WHERE THEY'VE EMPLOYED SOME TECHNOLOGIES TO BRIDGE THAT INTER OPERABILITY. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT IN ITS MOST EVIDENT WE HAVE A A SHOOTING AT A SCHOOL. IN A WERE OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND MOST PRECIOUS. THE THINGS THAT ARE THE MOST PRECIOUS THINGS TO US -- ARE WHERE THEY SHOULD FEEL SAFE -- SO. WHICH RICK WHICH REALLY REQUIRED IN THE REALITY IS WHEN YOU CAN REDUCE -- TIME TO RESOLUTION. WHEN YOU CAN REDUCE THAT TIME TO RESPOND? IN WOULD YOU COULDN'T IMPROVE -- THE THE IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE RESPONDING AGENCIES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE MUTUAL AID AGENCIES RESPONDING YEAH. YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE LIVES. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THAT'S A SCHOOL SHOOTING. WE'RE SHOOTING A BALL OR A FIRE. OR FLOOD OR EARTHQUAKE BUT IT IS GOING TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE -- YOU KNOW HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE EMS RESPONSE THOSE INCIDENTS. TECHNOLOGY THAT IS AVAILABLE TODAY. THAT COULD BE USED IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOW NOT ONLY FOR A PANIC ALARM SOFT PANIC ALARMS FOR EVERY TEACHER. AND HARD PANIC ALARMS IN EVERY SCHOOL BUT WITH THOSE WHO ARE WHEN THOSE ARE TRIGGERED THAT ALLOWS. THE SCHOOL RADIO SYSTEM IN THE LAWN FIRST RADIO SYSTEM IN THE FIRE IN THE M. S. RADIO SYSTEMS TO SHARE. ALLOWS THEM TO SHARE THEIR THEIR SECURITY VIDEO. IN ALLOWS THEM TO DO THAT SECURELY. IN A NETWORK WE'RE NOBODY OWNS THE MIDDLE WHERE NOBODY HAS TO SEE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY OF THEIR DATA. WHAT WERE IT IS SHARED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS AND WHETHER IT'S A PLANNED EVENT LIKE SUPERBOWL -- OR WHETHER IT'S AN UNPLANNED EVENT LIKE A SCHOOL SHOOTER MALL SHOOTER IN HERE'S THE BEAUTY OF THIS. IF WE CONNECT SCHOOL EIGHT WITH POLICE DEPARTMENT NAY. AT SCHOOL BE WHAT POLICE DEPARTMENT BE. WITHOUT CONNECTED PLEASED BERMAN A. B. AS WELL. WITHOUT KEL CONNECTED SCHOOL A AND B. AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL ON THE NETWORK AND WE'VE DONE THAT AND THOUSANDS OF INSTANCES. USING TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS IN FLORIDA -- AS RESPONSIBLE PARKING SHOOTING -- AND WE'VE DONE THAT WITH A RESOUNDING -- SUPPORT OF THE ACLU. BUT NO CONCERNS OF PRIVACY OR CIVIL LIBERTIES FOR CIVIL RIGHTS -- ISSUES BECAUSE I'M NOT GIVING UP MY DATA YOU CAN'T TAKE MY DATA. IT'S AN ASKING EXCEPT I HAVE AN INCIDENT. I INVITE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN A FIGHT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IN WERE NOW SHARING OR VIDEO WE'RE SHOWING AT A TABLE OWN HOME STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- ROUTE REALLY THE CRADLE OF TECHNOLOGY I MEAN I WAS RAISED IN SAN JOSE WAY BEFORE SILICON VALLEY.

TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OF FIRST RESPONDERS IN ADVANCE OF EMERGENCIES INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN USE TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY AND IN FACT WOULD HAPPEN WITHOUT SHOULDN'T HER SON TODAY RIGHT OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS TECHNOLOGY IS SO IMPORTANT -- DUE TO HIS -- DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES -- HER SON IS TWENTY YEARS OLD. FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN YOU WOULD NOT KNOW THAT HE HAS THESE -- IMPAIRMENTS BUT HIS RESPONSE IF YOU DID NOT KNOW THIS WOULD BE EXTREMELY DISTURBING AND FOR SOMEONE COMING FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO DOES NOT KNOW THAT. HE HAS THIS CONDITION WOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO RESPOND WOULD INTERPRET IT AS HIM ASSAULTING HIS MOTHER -- IN SO HER CONCERN IS THAT HE IS OF A A YOUNG MAN WHO IS PRONE TO WANDER FROM HOME HE DOES RUN AWAY FROM HOME. SHE LIVES IN FEAR OF HIS BEING FOUND BY LAW ENFORCEMENT HE WILL NOT RESPOND TO COMMANDS BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO AND THEY WILL NOT KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET THAT. AND AND WILL RESPOND NEGATIVELY SO WHAT THE BILL IS TRYING TO DO IN ADVANCE OF A NINE ONE ONE IS CREATED TECHNOLOGY WHICH ALREADY EXISTS AND IN FACT OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED IT. WE'RE A FAMILY CAN PRO ACTIVELY CHOOSE TO A AN OPEN INDIVIDUAL CAN DO THIS ON THEIR OWN ALSO IT DOESN'T SAY WHO COUNTER WHO CAN'T WHOEVER WANTS. TO CAN GIVE THEIR INFORMATION TO THE DISPATCHER SO THAT IT BECOMES AVAILABLE SOON AS YOUR PHONE. CALLS 911- THAT INFORMATION IS POPULATED FOR THE NINE ONE ONE DISPATCHER AND THEY THEN WOULD GIVE THAT INFORMATION TO WHOEVER THE FIRST RESPONDER IS. SO THAT THEY ARE AWARE AS THEY GO INTO A SITUATION WITH WHAT AND WHOM THEY'RE DEALING WITH AND WHAT AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE SHOULD BE. AND SO AGAIN SHE ASKED ME TO READ THIS A STATEMENT. SHE SAID JUST TELL THE COMMITTEE I SAID THANK YOU FOR LETTING US COME IN TODAY AND UNFORTUNATELY. MANUEL WAS NOT WAS OVER STIMULATED AND WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT HE IS GOOD NOW I'M HOPING THAT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE. THAT THEY WILL GET TO MEET MANNY AND THESE ARE THE VERY REASONS WHY WE NEED AN ALERT SYSTEM LIKE THIS SO THAT WHEN HE HAS CONTACT WITH FIRST RESPONDERS THE UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S GOING THROUGH IS A MELTDOWN -- IT WAS ACTUALLY VERY TRAUMATIC ENOUGH SETTING UP BEFORE THE HEARING STARTED TODAY SO I I URGE SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS BILL WE DID SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENTS. TO ADDRESS -- CONCERNS FROM -- YES WE KNOW THIS TECHNOLOGY EXISTS WE KNOW THE STATE IS ALREADY UPDATING THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM SO IT SEEMS VERY LOGICAL THAT WE WOULD WANT THE STATE TO UPDATE THE SYSTEM WITH THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY GIVE FIRST RESPONDERS TOOLS TO PREVENT NEGATIVE ENCOUNTERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT.

AND THAT HAS RESULTED IN TRAGEDIES THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID -- ASSUMING COOPER HELD A WONDERFUL INFORMATIONAL HEARING LAST YEAR ABOUT TO VARIOUS -- TECHNOLOGIES IN VARIOUS APPROACHES THAT LOCALITIES ARE ALREADY TAKING -- HOWEVER THIS WOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO THIS STATEWIDE -- AND AND WHILE IT WILL FOR SURE AND IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES -- FOR INSTANCE LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FIRES HAVE BEEN MENTIONED PERHAPS YOU COULD SAY -- OR MY MOTHER MY GRANDMOTHER IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR SHE NEEDS HELP CAN DOWN THE STAIRS AND WHICH TO RESPOND WOULD INSTANTLY KNOW THAT THERE IS A PERSON THE SECOND FLOOR WHO MIGHT NEED HELP GETTING DOWN.

CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO A ROBUST WIND AND DISTILLERY AND BREWERY INDUSTRY IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT PLEASE COME TO MY DISTRICT THAT'S THE THIRTY FIFTH AND SAMPLE SOME OF OUR WARES -- THIS BILL WOULD SUPPORT THAT INDUSTRY BY ALLOWING QUALIFIED COLLEGE STUDENTS TO TASTE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. BUT ONLY WHERE THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION HAS AN ESTABLISHED ASSOCIATES ARE BACHELOR'S DEGREE DEGREE PROGRAM IN HOTEL MANAGEMENT OF THE OR THE CULINARY ARTS. WITH ME TODAY IS A PROFESSOR FOR MY DISTRICT TO QUESTION SANTA BARBARA CITY COLLEGE HE'S TO MY LEFT. AND THAT IS PROFESSOR MICHAEL VON HECKLER HE LIKES A FEW WORDS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU BUT MY NAME IS MICHAEL VON HECKLER AND I'M AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR OF WINE AT BOTH THE CITY COLLEGE IN SANTA BARBARA AND ALAN HANCOCK IN. IN UP SANTA MARIA WE ALREADY HAVE AN EXISTING LAW HERE OTHER ALLOWS -- STUDENTS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE TO TASTE. IN SCHOOLS WHERE WE HAVE AN ANALOGY AND VITICULTURE PROGRAM. BUT I BELIEVE THERE WAS A AN OVERSIGHT IN NOT LISTING HOTEL MANAGEMENT AND CULINARY ARTS. AND AT CITY COLLEGE OUR ADMINISTRATION IN LOOKING AT THAT LOSS SAID WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGY VITICULTURE HERE SO. YOU CAN'T TASTE IN CLASS SO UNFORTUNATELY EVERY YEAR I GET ABOUT TWENTY FIVE STUDENTS WHO ARE IN THE CULINARY PROGRAM AND IF THERE'S ONE STUDENT THE CLASS WAS NINETEEN OR TWENTY WE HAVE TO FOREGO TASTING. ONE SO IT'S A BIG PART OF THE CULINARY INDUSTRY FOR THE STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO MATCH THE ONE IN THE FOODS. AND WHAT WE DO IS ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS ARE UNDER TWENTY ONE UNDER MY SUPERVISION THEY HAVE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO SPIT. WHICH IS WHAT WE DO NORMALLY IN THE WINE TASTING INDUSTRY.

THREE WHEN I INTRODUCED THE BILL EARLIER THIS YEAR IT WAS INTENDED TO RAISE THE IMPORTANCE OF CYBERSECURITY AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT STRIKING OUT THE NEW OFFICES -- PROVISIONS HOWEVER ANOTHER COMPONENT OF AB TWELVE FORTY TWO ARE THE PROVISIONS RELATING TO CYBER SECURITY OF THE STATE AGENCY WOULD AGENCIES WHO DO NOT DIRECTLY REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR. THE LACK OF CYBER SECURITY ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CERTAIN INDEPENDENT AND CONSTITUTIONAL AGENCIES HAS BEEN OF CONCERN TO ME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE AND I WERE JOINT AUTHORS OF THE BILL LAST YEAR THAT SOUGHT SIMILAR ACCOUNTABILITY. AND UNIFORMITY IN THE CYBER SECURITY COMPLIANCE. CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES HOLD SOME OF THE MOST CRITICAL DATA AND FUNCTIONS FOR THE STATE AND HAVING NO LEGISLATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HOUSE SECURE THEIR NETWORKS ARE IS AN ACCEPTABLE. WE MUST BE ABLE TO VERIFY THAT THEY ARE UNDERGOING INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS SECURITY AUDITS AND ARE WORKING TO REMEDIATE KNOWN VULNERABILITIES. AS THIS BILL IS NARROWED IN THIS COMMITTEE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE INDEPENDENT AND CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO FIND APPROPRIATE WAY TO ENSURE. CYBERSECURITY ACROSS THE STATE WIDE ENTERPRISE. THE CONSTITUTIONAL AS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS INVOLVING A PROCUREMENT AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST REGARDING WHO WILL ASSESS THEIR SYSTEMS. I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN FIND A SOLUTION THROUGH ALTERNATIVE REPORTING MECHANISMS THAT CAN REACH OUR SHARED GOAL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND HIGH STANDARDS OF SECURITY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE WILSHIRE SECOND. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. SEEING THAT IN THE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. GIVE ME MARK ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY STATE ALEX PADILLA -- WE JUST WANTED TO ECHO SORT OF THE SENTIMENT THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED THAT WE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY IN ACCOUNTING FOR ALL ENTITIES BUT AT THIS TIME.

THE FLEXIBILITY WE HAVE TO ADDRESS ANY RISKS FOR CYBERSECURITY AND ALSO -- FOR THE COMP SELECTIVE INTEREST IN OUR DISCUSSIONS THIS IS NOT AN INTENT AND SO WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THESE PROVISIONS AND THANK STAFF INVOLVED WITH ALL THESE DISCUSSIONS. IN ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RUNNING COULD GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE CERAS OFFICE -- WE AS A SUPPORT AT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GOALS OF STANDARDIZATION ACROSS THE AGENCIES AND FOR THEIR COLLABORATION AND WERE SPECIALLY I'M HAPPY TO HEAR -- HER COMMENTS REGARDING -- HEARING OUR OWN CONCERNS AND WILLING TO WORK FURTHER ON THE AMENDMENTS AND AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH RESPECT. TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST CAN AND RISK OF EXPOSURE OF DATA FROM MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS BUT WE DO FEEL I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE OUR OFFICES CAN WORK TOGETHER.
