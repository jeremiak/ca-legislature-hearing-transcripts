00:53:18.762 --> 00:53:19.729
THIS BILL OVER THE LAST FEW

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:22.299
MONTHS- GLAD WE CAN FINALLY

00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:24.267
HEAR THIS PIECE OF IT. I'M GLAD

00:53:24.334 --> 00:53:25.869
THAT THE REST ALSO GOT THROUGH.

00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:27.704
SO I DON'T THINK ESPECIALLY IN

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:28.838
THIS COMMITTEE WE NEED TO TALK

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.273
ABOUT HOW DEVASTATING LEARNING

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:30.974
LOSS HAS BEEN DURING THE

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:32.943
PANDEMIC. THE CHALLENGES THAT

00:53:33.009 --> 00:53:33.843
STUDENTS FACE ESPECIALLY IN

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:35.078
SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES WERE

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:37.347
CONNECTIVITY WAS INITIAL- THE

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:38.915
CHALLENGES WE FACE THAT A

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:39.482
HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND KIDS

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:42.085
JUST SIMPLY NEVER SHOWED UP- IT

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:43.486
AND THERE WAS LOTS OF KIDS IN

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:44.788
PRIVATE SCHOOLS WELL THIS ISN'T

00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:46.590
JUST A PUBLIC SCHOOL ISSUE. SO

00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:47.724
WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE KIDS

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:48.725
WHO EITHER VOTE PARTIAL

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:50.360
EDUCATIONS OR DIDN'T

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:51.528
COMPLETELY- GET WHAT THEY

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:53.496
NEEDED. AND WE DON'T WANT KIDS

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:54.698
TO SUFFER AS A RESULT WE WANT

00:53:54.764 --> 00:53:56.166
TO HOLD THEM HARMLESS. SO THIS

00:53:56.232 --> 00:53:57.734
BILL IS PRETTY SIMPLE GIVES

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:59.970
OPTIONS FOR PARENTS. TO BE ABLE

00:54:00.036 --> 00:54:01.605
TO PURSUE GIVEN THE INDIVIDUAL

00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:03.607
NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS. IT

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:05.508
ALLOWS THEM TO SEEK POSSIBLE

00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:07.177
RETENTION- I KNOW THAT'S

00:54:07.243 --> 00:54:08.278
CONTROVERSIAL BUT A PARENT

00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:10.113
SHOULD KNOW HOW TO BE ABLE TO

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.015
ADDRESS. THE POSSIBILITY OF

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:13.550
HOLDING A STUDENT BACK IF MAYBE

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:14.818
THEY GOT JUST NOTHING

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:15.986
UNFORTUNATELY COULD NEVER

00:54:16.052 --> 00:54:17.420
REALLY GET ANYTHING ON THE ON

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:18.989
MY EDUCATION. WE KNOW THAT'S

00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:20.023
TRUE ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF THE

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:20.924
SMALL ONES BUT PARENTS SHOULD

00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:23.059
BE ABLE TO. REQUEST THAT IN AND

00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:25.061
HAVE A- CONSULTATION WITH A

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:26.630
SCHOOL TEACHER TO SEE IF THAT'S

00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:28.164
THE BEST OPTION FOR THE CHILD.

00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:30.600
WE WANT- STUDENTS AND PARENTS

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:32.702
WHO. PERHAPS THEY JUST HAD A

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:34.537
TOUGH YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL-

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:36.406
COULDN'T LEARN SPANISH ONLINE.

00:54:36.473 --> 00:54:38.508
GOTTA SEE OTHERWISE WAS ON ON

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:41.211

00:54:41.277 --> 00:54:42.479

pPASS OF DOESN'T HURT THEIR GPA

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:47.617
OVERALL. I'M OBVIOUSLY THE UC

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:49.152
AND CSU AS THEY SEE THESE WILL

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:50.120
KNOW THAT THE STUDENT PROBABLY

00:54:50.186 --> 00:54:51.554
HAD SOME STRUGGLES I'M SURE

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:52.889
EVERYBODY'S AS HE'S GETTING TO

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:54.290
THE SCHOOL NEXT YEAR WE'LL TALK

00:54:54.357 --> 00:54:56.059
ABOUT THEIR STRUGGLES- BUT IT

SCHOOL BOARD- NOT NOT OF A

01:48:57.297 --> 01:49:00.700
SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT- AND I

01:49:00.767 --> 01:49:02.936
DID HEAR FROM THEM THAT. AND

01:49:03.003 --> 01:49:04.671
SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:49:04.738 --> 01:49:06.706
IT'S ONLY THE SUPERINTENDENT

01:49:06.773 --> 01:49:08.775
WHO MAY HAVE- TENURE AND VERY

01:49:08.842 --> 01:49:11.211
VERY SMALL- SUPERINTENDENT

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:12.946

01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:18.852

01:49:26.593 --> 01:49:29.162

LIKE MINE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS

01:51:15.835 --> 01:51:17.270
OF WORKFORCE DECISIONS ARE

01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:18.838

POPULATIONS IN OUR ENROLLMENT

01:51:32.318 --> 01:51:33.319
MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

NEEDING OR NOT NEEDING-

01:51:35.221 --> 01:51:36.089

THE 12% DROP IN ONE SCHOOL YEAR

01:51:53.406 --> 01:51:54.274
THAT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF

LONG BEACH UNIFIED LOSING

01:51:55.909 --> 01:51:57.510

01:52:10.156 --> 01:52:11.724
DISTRICTS. HOWEVER THERE'S NO

01:52:11.791 --> 01:52:12.725
WAY TO KNOW IF THESE THREE

01:52:12.792 --> 01:52:14.060

WITH LOCK DISTRICTS INTO A

01:52:44.757 --> 01:52:46.192
SITUATION. THAT COULD BE A

01:52:46.259 --> 01:52:47.594
VIABLE IN THE FUTURE IF WE WORK

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:51.498
HARD TO MAINTAIN. A TEACHING

01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:52.165

FLUCTUATIONS THAT A LARGER

HAVE A LEGAL CAREERS TEACHER

01:54:31.864 --> 01:54:33.566

OR SHE COULD TEACH OF FIRE

01:54:35.235 --> 01:54:38.171

01:54:44.777 --> 01:54:47.480
CTE TEACHERS HAVE VASTLY

01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:48.081

LEGAL CAREER TEACHERS WHEN I

EIGHTEEN PROGRAMS OFFERED ARE

THE END OF ROC. IN A MATTER OF

CONCEPT TO GET SUBSTITUTE

02:13:36.808 --> 02:13:38.210
TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM. FOR

02:13:38.276 --> 02:13:40.278
EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:13:40.345 --> 02:13:42.114
SHOULD BE DONE IS THE COUNTY

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:44.082
OFFICE OF EDUCATION SHOULD BE

02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:46.017
THE ONES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE

02:13:46.084 --> 02:13:48.086
FOR HIRING SUBSTITUTES FOR

02:13:48.153 --> 02:13:50.122
EIGHT COUNTY. INSTEAD OF

02:13:50.188 --> 02:13:51.323
SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS HAVING TO

02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:52.758
GO IN AND REGISTER ANY

02:13:52.824 --> 02:13:55.060
PARTICULAR DISTRICT PAY FOR-

02:13:55.127 --> 02:13:57.462
BISA EXCUSE ME PAY FOR-

02:13:57.529 --> 02:13:58.397
FINGERPRINTS AND THAT KIND OF

02:13:58.463 --> 02:14:00.465
STUFF IF WE GET IT IN ONE

02:14:00.532 --> 02:14:01.633
PARTICULAR SPOT COUNTY OF

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:03.635
OFFICE OF EDUCATION WE WOULD

02:14:03.702 --> 02:14:05.170
HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK IN ALL

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:05.971
THE DISTRICTS WITHIN THE

02:14:06.037 --> 02:14:08.173
COUNTY. THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT

02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:10.242
NOW YOU HAVE PRIVATE BUSINESSES

02:14:10.308 --> 02:14:13.478
TO DO THAT BUT THEY TAKE 20% OF

02:14:13.545 --> 02:14:15.247
EVERYTHING AS A SUBSTITUTE

02:14:15.313 --> 02:14:17.115
TEACHER ARE. YOU REAL PROBLEM

02:14:17.182 --> 02:14:19.384
BECOMES. IF WE START PUTTING

02:14:19.451 --> 02:14:21.553
PEOPLE IN THE CLASSROOM WHO ARE

02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:24.256
LET'S SAY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY

02:14:24.322 --> 02:14:25.724
FIVE TWENTY SIX. THEY HAVE NO

02:14:25.791 --> 02:14:27.959
EXPERIENCE THE KIDS IN A HIGH

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:29.227
SCHOOL ARE GOING TO TAKE

02:14:29.294 --> 02:14:30.562
ADVANTAGE OF THESE PEOPLE

02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:32.931
THEY'RE GONNA THAT THE CLASSES

02:14:32.998 --> 02:14:35.934
ARE NOT GOING TO BE- R. AS

02:14:36.001 --> 02:14:37.536
APPROPRIATE AS THEY SHOULD BE

02:14:37.602 --> 02:14:38.904
AND THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT

02:14:38.970 --> 02:14:46.378
HAPPENS IS. AND THAT IS THEY

02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:48.914
GET FIRED. THE BOTTOM IS A

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:51.149
RIGHT FOR SUCH TEACH IN. IF YOU

02:14:51.216 --> 02:14:52.984
MORE TO IN THE CLASSROOM HOW TO

02:14:53.051 --> 02:14:54.553
FIX THE SYSTEM THAT SUBSIDY

02:14:54.619 --> 02:14:56.087
TEACHERS DEAL WITH. WE ASK YOU

02:14:56.154 --> 02:14:58.156
TO NO THIS. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR

02:14:58.223 --> 02:14:59.057
SUBSTITUTE. THANK YOU GREAT

02:14:59.124 --> 02:15:00.525
THANK YOU. WE'VE FROM SOME

02:15:00.592 --> 02:15:02.894
OPPOSITE WENT OVER BACK TO THE-

02:15:02.961 --> 02:15:03.829
I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL

02:15:03.895 --> 02:15:05.030
TODAY I STRUGGLE WITH IT A BIT

02:15:05.096 --> 02:15:06.965
JUST AS ONE WHO IS A TEACHER.

02:15:07.032 --> 02:15:08.667
AND STILL SUBS ABOUT THE FALL

02:15:08.733 --> 02:15:10.702
ARE. YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST HEARD

02:15:10.769 --> 02:15:12.504
A WITNESS MENTIONED PRIVATE

02:15:12.571 --> 02:15:13.738
COMPANIES HIRING SUBSTITUTES

02:15:13.805 --> 02:15:16.308
WILL. BE A VIOLATION AB FIVE

02:15:16.374 --> 02:15:17.976
BUT EITHER WAY I DON'T THINK

02:15:18.043 --> 02:15:19.478
PRIVATE COMPANIES SHOULD BE.

02:15:19.544 --> 02:15:21.079
HIRING SUBSTITUTES AND PUTTING

02:15:21.146 --> 02:15:22.214
A PUBLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOM THAT

02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:24.082
SEEMS RATHER COMPLICATED TO ME.

02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:25.684
AND MAYBE NOT SAFE BUT I

02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:27.719
APPRECIATE. THE OPPOSITION'S

02:15:27.786 --> 02:15:30.789

PREPARATION OF A SUBSTITUTE

02:15:32.524 --> 02:15:33.258
TEACHER I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:15:33.325 --> 02:15:35.026
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILLS TOTALLY

02:15:35.093 --> 02:15:35.827
ABOUT ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME

02:15:35.894 --> 02:15:38.163
OVERLAP MAYBE. BUT I THINK THAT

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:39.564
IS AN ISSUE WE COULD ALWAYS

02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:41.266
CONTEMPLATE GOING FORWARD BUT

02:15:41.333 --> 02:15:42.167

02:15:53.645 --> 02:15:56.882
THERE A TIMELINE ON THIS AS- I

02:15:56.948 --> 02:15:58.884
KNOW THAT IT'S IT REFERENCING.

02:15:58.950 --> 02:16:00.919

02:16:07.359 --> 02:16:13.298
NO SUNSET CLAUSE THAT. THAT'S A

02:16:13.365 --> 02:16:14.466
FANTASTIC. THIS THE THIS IS TO

02:16:14.533 --> 02:16:15.233

02:16:17.402 --> 02:16:19.304
NOT SIR. THE HIRING PROCESS OF

02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:21.740
A TEACHER- SO THE QUALITY OF

02:16:21.806 --> 02:16:24.042

SYSTEM THE HIGHER.AND THEN I

02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:29.714
THINK A QUESTION FOR THE CHAIR

02:16:29.781 --> 02:16:32.384
IS. I KNOW THE C. BEST HAS

02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:34.386
ALWAYS BEEN REQUIRED TO HIRE

02:16:34.452 --> 02:16:36.488
CALIFORNIA TEACHERS BUT THEN

02:16:36.555 --> 02:16:38.623
DISTRICTS INDIVIDUALLY

02:16:38.690 --> 02:16:40.625
SOMETIMES ADD THEIR OWN

02:16:40.692 --> 02:16:43.595
PROCESSES ON TOP OF THAT IT IS

02:16:43.662 --> 02:16:46.164
THAT STILL THE CASE AS FAR AS

02:16:46.231 --> 02:16:48.433
JUST HAVING THEIR OWN. IF YOU

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:49.668

02:16:49.734 --> 02:16:51.770

THAT. IN ORDER TO BE HIRED IN

02:16:57.042 --> 02:16:58.410

02:16:58.476 --> 02:17:00.278
