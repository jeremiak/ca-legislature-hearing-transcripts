UNDERSTAND THE UNPAID PART BUT

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:20.275
THE OTHER PART OF THAT IS THE

INTO THAT BECAUSE THAT DOES

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:33.856
COVER A LOT I'VE HAD EMPLOYEES

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:36.692

FIRED BY DOING OUT ALLOW THE

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:50.039
EMPLOYERS. TO DO THAT- BECAUSE

01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:52.441
THEY ARE- THEY HAVE THAT

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:54.443
ABILITY TO DO THAT YEAH. A

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:55.511
COUPLE OF DISTINCTIONS HAVE

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:56.478
AFFECTED DEBT THROUGH THE

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:59.048
CHAIR. IT MIND- TO QUALIFY

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:02.284
UNDER THE SPECIFIC AKKA WORKER

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:02.885

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:08.057
WEEKS AS WELL. OF THE RELIEF

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:09.425
THEY ARE OUT OF LUCK SO FOR

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.326
EXAMPLE IF A PARENT IS ALL OF

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:13.095
THEIR BENEFITS FOR MATERNITY OR

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.763

BE A DEATH OF A CHILD OR FAMILY

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.368
MEMBER SO AGAIN I THINK THOSE

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:37.553
THEM TIME AND A HALF TO COMMAND

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.021
WHICH COSTS BY THE WAY PUBLIC

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:40.723
AND THAT THE CLASS WHEN WE SAY

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:42.991
PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ARCHITECT THAT

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:46.128
TAXPAYERS THE COST THEM

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:46.628
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:49.865
DOLLARS. TO COVER THAT I THINK

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:52.067
L. A. COUNTY ALONE WAS UPWARDS

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:54.737
OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS-

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:57.106
SO THERE IS A THERE IS A COST

01:12:57.172 --> 01:12:59.241
TO THAT NOT COST. FOR PRIVATE

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:01.376
BUSINESSES. IS ABSORBED EITHER

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:03.145
BY CUSTOMERS OR OR BY THE

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:07.382
PRIVATE BUSINESS SO- YOU KNOW

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:08.383
THOSE THOSE ARE BIG CONCERNS

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:11.053
FOR ME. ANY OF THESE I THINK IT

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.222
SHOULD BE I THINK YOU SHOULD

01:13:13.288 --> 01:13:16.959
WORK TO FOLD IT INTO CFRA- I

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:18.894
CAN'T SEE ADDING ANOTHER LAYER.

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:22.765
OF LEAD TIME- ESPECIALLY FOR

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:24.333
SMALL BUSINESSES. THERE'S A

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:26.602
REASON MY WIFE'S BUSINESS NEVER

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:28.771
EXPANDED BEYOND HER YEAH SHE

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:30.839
COULD PROBABLY BE EMPLOYING TEN

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:31.440
TO FIFTEEN PEOPLE NOW IF YOU

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:33.542
WANTED AND HAD GROWN HER TAX

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:36.011
BUSINESS. BUT SHE WON'T NEED

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:36.912
THESE TYPE OF THINGS ARE THE

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:39.214
REASON WHY. SO THAT'S WHY I'M

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:40.315
GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:42.217

MY ISSUES ARE. SLIGHTLY

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:53.629
DIFFERENT LIKE I DON'T ACTUALLY

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:56.431
BEREAVEMENT LEAVE PART OF THIS

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:59.067
AND- I THINK IT IS- VOTER SOME

01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:00.435
FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AND

01:14:00.502 --> 01:14:02.004
I DO UNDERSTAND IS ONLY WOMAN'S

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:03.906
CONCERNS ABOUT THE OTHER THE

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:05.674
SIZE OF THE BUSINESS AND YOU

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:07.142
KNOW IT WHAT TRIGGERS THAT

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:08.310
WHETHER YOU GET TEN DAYS OR

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:10.345
THREE DAYS- BECAUSE IF YOU.

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:13.081
HAVE YOU KNOW. ELEVEN EMPLOYEES

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:13.982
OR TWENTY SIX EMPLOYEES ARE

01:14:14.049 --> 01:14:16.218
STILL IN THE SAME- SIZE OF

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.620
EMPLOYER. MY ISSUE IS WITH THE

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:20.556
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION PART OF

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:23.392
THIS- FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:25.561
WE'VE SEEN. THIS BUSINESS

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:27.529
COMMUNITY M. IN MY OPINION JUST

01:14:27.596 --> 01:14:29.498
MY HUMBLE OPINION. COME UNDER

01:14:29.565 --> 01:14:32.701
ATTACK- FROM. QUITE FRANKLY

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:34.670
PREDATORY LAWSUITS I'M IN A LOT

01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:36.672
OF WAYS NOT SO MAYBE DESERVED

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:38.907
SOME OF THEM- I THINK OR NOT.

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.075
SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.743
WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT LIKE WE

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.712
MAIN STREET- COMING THROUGH

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:45.814
COVERT IN THE DEVASTATIONS

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:47.382
HAPPEN TO MAIN STREET. SOME OF

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:49.017
THESE BUSINESSES THE MOM AND

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:50.719
POPS THE BAKERY THEY MAY NOT

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:53.222
KNOW OF ALL THESE NEW LAWS.

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:54.289
THAT ARE DROPPED ON OUR YOU

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.392
EVERY SINGLE YEAR. BUT THE

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:58.861
ATTORNEYS DO. THAT'S WHAT THEY

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:02.197
DO. IT'S THEIR JOB TO DO THIS

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:05.033
RIGHT. IT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEIR

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.102
LIVING AND SO WHEN WE HAVE

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.671
THESE LAWSUITS THEIR OPTION IS

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:11.473
TO FIGHT IT AND PAY TENS OF

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.675
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND OR

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:16.445

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:22.818
IT'S NOT THE BREED APART OF

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:24.219
THIS QUITE FRANKLY IT IS THAT

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:25.921
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.222

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:29.124
THAT. THAT WEIGHT THAT WE PUT

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:30.392
ON THAT AND RELEASED THE SMALL

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:31.727

BROUGHT IT IS EVEN MORE.

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:50.479
RELEVANT I THINK HIS VISCERAL

01:16:10.799 --> 01:16:11.600
THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:13.135

THAT YEAH I DON'T KNOW MAYBE

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:21.543

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:41.063
THAT IF THIS LAST YEAR HASN'T

AS I UNDERSTAND THE EMPLOYERS

01:34:47.681 --> 01:34:51.285

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:53.621

NINETY FIVE MASKS ARE MADE

01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:56.057
AVAILABLE TO THEM. IF THEY

01:34:56.123 --> 01:34:57.992

01:34:58.059 --> 01:34:59.760
THEM THEMSELVES. IS THAT

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:02.263
CORRECT. BUT MY MAIN QUESTION

01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:04.799

01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:16.177
THEM. THEN THE- BUT- AT THE

01:35:16.243 --> 01:35:19.213
STATE CANNOT HAVE THE MASKS OF

CONSIDERED BY A COURT

02:42:45.222 --> 02:42:47.090
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AND SO

02:42:47.157 --> 02:42:48.758
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND I DON'T

KNOW IF THIS IS BEEN DISCUSSED

02:42:49.459 --> 02:42:51.928
I ALMOST FEEL BAD SAYING THIS

02:42:51.995 --> 02:42:52.496

02:42:54.064 --> 02:42:56.366
WAY TO GIVE EXAMPLES OR OR TO

02:42:56.433 --> 02:42:57.501
SPECIFY WHAT A REASONABLE

02:42:57.567 --> 02:42:59.302
ACCOMMODATION WHAT WHAT THE RAM

02:42:59.369 --> 02:43:00.737
OF THAT IS I MEAN IS A

02:43:00.804 --> 02:43:02.506
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.

02:43:02.572 --> 02:43:03.607
BRINGING MY CHILD WITH ME TO

02:43:03.673 --> 02:43:04.641

02:43:04.708 --> 02:43:07.444
ACCOMMODATION- CHANGING MY

02:43:07.511 --> 02:43:08.578

02:43:13.416 --> 02:43:14.584
WHAT THE COURTS WOULD ASSUME

02:43:14.651 --> 02:43:15.285
WOULD BE THE REASON

02:43:15.352 --> 02:43:17.087
ACCOMMODATION AND I THINK THAT

02:43:17.154 --> 02:43:19.089
THAT CAUSES A LOT OF FEAR I

02:43:19.156 --> 02:43:21.258
JUST. WOULD LIKE TO BE. TIGHTER

02:43:21.324 --> 02:43:24.694
IN WHAT WERE WERE SUGGESTING IS

02:43:24.761 --> 02:43:26.763
APPROPRIATE I JUST- I CAN'T

02:43:26.830 --> 02:43:28.765
EVEN IMAGINE ALL THE THINGS

02:43:28.832 --> 02:43:30.567
THAT COULD COME UP RIGHT NOW SO

02:43:30.634 --> 02:43:32.402
I THINK THAT THAT THAT MOST

02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:33.436
EMPLOYERS PROBABLY CAN'T

02:43:33.503 --> 02:43:36.072
EITHER. SO YES IN THIS IS

02:43:36.139 --> 02:43:36.706
CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE'RE STILL

02:43:36.773 --> 02:43:37.574
TRYING TO WORK THROUGH

TO SORT OF FIGURE OUT THERE

02:43:40.177 --> 02:43:42.712
RIGHT- TEMPORARY I THINK IS A

02:43:42.779 --> 02:43:44.314

SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TILL FIVE

02:43:49.052 --> 02:43:49.986
BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY MY CHILD

02:43:50.053 --> 02:43:51.288
GETS OUT OF SCHOOL THREE SO I'M

02:43:51.354 --> 02:43:52.155
GONNA SAY HEY I NEED

IT'S MORE IF IT'S TEMPORARY-

02:43:58.562 --> 02:43:59.863
SOMETHING HAPPENS WHERE THERE

02:43:59.930 --> 02:44:01.097

STILL WORKING ON THE DEFINITION

02:44:03.700 --> 02:44:05.101
OF WHAT THAT MEANS IN ADDITION

02:44:05.168 --> 02:44:07.404
TO THAT- EMPLOYERS DON'T HAVE

02:44:07.470 --> 02:44:08.505
TO PROVIDE ACCOMMODATION IF IT

02:44:08.572 --> 02:44:10.373

IMPOSE A HARDSHIP ON. YOU KNOW

02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:20.517
THAT STORE SO WE'RE STILL

02:44:20.584 --> 02:44:22.452
WORKING THROUGH. THESE

02:44:22.519 --> 02:44:24.788
DEFINITIONS AND I AGREE THEY

02:44:24.854 --> 02:44:26.890
NEED TO BE MORE FLESHED OUT-

02:44:26.957 --> 02:44:27.824

SCHOOL CLOSING BUT THAT'S NOT

02:44:31.094 --> 02:44:32.729

A FEDERAL HOLIDAY AND SO

02:44:39.869 --> 02:44:41.471
EVERYBODY NEEDS AN

THROUGH. THE SPECIFICS. YEP AND

02:45:02.759 --> 02:45:04.494
I'M COMMITTED TO DOING THAT YOU

02:45:04.561 --> 02:45:05.528

EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT ALSO

02:45:24.814 --> 02:45:29.853
COVERS THE HIRING PROCESS- WHAT

02:45:29.919 --> 02:45:31.821
IS TO PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM

02:45:31.888 --> 02:45:34.257
INTERVIEWING FOR A JOB WHO HAS

02:45:34.324 --> 02:45:35.759
SO MANY RESTRICTIONS THAT THEY

02:45:35.825 --> 02:45:38.361
ACTUALLY CAN'T. BECAUSE OF

02:45:38.428 --> 02:45:40.096
FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES THEY

02:45:40.163 --> 02:45:42.699
CAN'T ACTUALLY FUNCTION IN THAT

02:45:42.766 --> 02:45:46.069
POSITION. HOW IS THE EMPLOYER

02:45:46.136 --> 02:45:48.071
WHAT POSITION IS THAT PUT HIM

02:45:48.138 --> 02:45:52.108
IN FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE-

02:45:52.175 --> 02:45:53.543
EIGHT IF THEY SAY NO BECAUSE

02:45:53.610 --> 02:45:54.878
YOU CAN'T DO THE POSITION

02:45:54.944 --> 02:45:56.112

OBLIGATIONS ARE THEY NOW

02:45:58.515 --> 02:46:04.154
SUBJECT TO. BEING SUIT. YOU

WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:46:06.589 --> 02:46:08.258
COMBINATION IT'S FOR TEMPORARY

02:46:08.325 --> 02:46:09.893
RIGHT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE

02:46:09.959 --> 02:46:10.760
IT'S SORT OF AN ONGOING

02:46:10.827 --> 02:46:12.796
SITUATION WHERE WE KNOW EVERY

02:46:12.862 --> 02:46:14.698
DAY OUR KID GETS OUT OF SCHOOL

02:46:14.764 --> 02:46:16.433
TO THIRTY RIGHT- AND SO THAT'S

02:46:16.499 --> 02:46:18.034
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT-

02:46:18.101 --> 02:46:20.003
AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE

02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:21.504
WE'VE TALKED TO THE CHAMBER AND

02:46:21.571 --> 02:46:22.872
THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED SOME

02:46:22.939 --> 02:46:24.741
OF THESE CONCERNS. I MEAN TO

02:46:24.808 --> 02:46:26.109
CONTINUE TO DO THAT I DON'T

02:46:26.176 --> 02:46:28.111
WANT TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT

02:46:28.178 --> 02:46:30.046
HAS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES-

02:46:30.113 --> 02:46:31.781
BUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO

02:46:31.848 --> 02:46:33.183
YOU ADDRESS THE NEEDS WERE YOU

02:46:33.249 --> 02:46:34.951
DO YOU SEE AS AS OUR OUR

02:46:35.018 --> 02:46:36.052
WITNESS TESTIFIED

02:46:36.119 --> 02:46:37.854
DISCRIMINATION THAT DOES HAPPEN

02:46:37.921 --> 02:46:39.389
RIGHT WITHOUT HAVING SOME SORT

02:46:39.456 --> 02:46:40.090
OF NEGATIVE UNINTENDED

02:46:40.156 --> 02:46:41.424
CONSEQUENCES SO WE'RE GOING TO

02:46:41.491 --> 02:46:42.625
CONTINUE TO FINISH OUT AND I

02:46:42.692 --> 02:46:45.462
THINK AGAIN SOME. BUSINESS

02:46:45.528 --> 02:46:47.197
CONCERNS ARE. THERE ONE LAWSUIT

02:46:47.263 --> 02:46:49.065
AWAY FROM NOT BEING IN BUSINESS

02:46:49.132 --> 02:46:54.471
SOMETIMES- AND IT IN OKAY. FROM

02:46:54.537 --> 02:46:56.272
FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIMENT

02:46:56.339 --> 02:46:57.540
I HARKEN BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN

02:46:57.607 --> 02:46:59.576
I WAS A KID MY SISTER GOT HURT

02:46:59.642 --> 02:47:01.578
ON THE PLAYGROUND MY MOM WHO IS

02:47:01.644 --> 02:47:03.246
A TEACHER BEFORE SHE PASSED

02:47:03.313 --> 02:47:04.981
AWAY HAD TO COME AND GET HER

02:47:05.048 --> 02:47:06.883
AND TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR AND

02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:07.417
THEN WHILE SHE WAS AT THE

02:47:07.484 --> 02:47:09.119
DOCTOR I GOT HURT. AND SO MY

02:47:09.185 --> 02:47:11.187
DAD WHO IS ALSO A TEACHER HAD

02:47:11.254 --> 02:47:13.390
TO COME BACK AND GET ME- THEY

02:47:13.456 --> 02:47:14.858
HAD NO PROBLEMS DOING THAT IN

02:47:14.924 --> 02:47:18.828
THE PAST YEP AND I'M I'M HOPING

02:47:18.895 --> 02:47:19.396
THINGS DIDN'T CHANGE A WHOLE

02:47:19.462 --> 02:47:20.864
LOT. AN ENGINE ON THOSE DAYS

02:47:20.930 --> 02:47:22.866
THAT THEY HAVE THAT. THAT IS

02:47:22.932 --> 02:47:24.467
MISSED GONZALEZ HAD POINTED OUT

02:47:24.534 --> 02:47:25.935
THAT THEY HAVE THAT CAPABILITY

02:47:26.002 --> 02:47:27.537
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT ALREADY.

02:47:27.604 --> 02:47:29.839
AND I JUST ON THE LAWSUIT- YOU

02:47:29.906 --> 02:47:30.607
KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR

02:47:30.673 --> 02:47:31.875
STATES HAVE PASSED THIS

02:47:31.941 --> 02:47:33.443
ALREADY- ALASKA DELAWARE

02:47:33.510 --> 02:47:35.078
MINNESOTA AND NEW YORK AND THEY

02:47:35.145 --> 02:47:35.612
HAVE NOT SEEN A DRAMATIC

02:47:35.678 --> 02:47:37.981
INCREASE IN LAWSUITS- I THINK

02:47:38.047 --> 02:47:39.048
IT'S THE SAME. ODDS OF BEING

02:47:39.115 --> 02:47:40.517

AT THE C. MAKING JUMPING BUT

03:12:53.061 --> 03:12:55.931
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT IS

03:12:55.997 --> 03:12:56.498
NOT AS UNIVERSAL AS YOU YOU

03:12:56.564 --> 03:12:57.966

03:13:00.135 --> 03:13:02.971
A LOT OF THESE- METHODOLOGY BUT

03:13:03.038 --> 03:13:04.773
NOT EVERY HOSPITAL DOES AND

03:13:04.839 --> 03:13:07.542
WHAT THIS BILL. ADDRESSES ITS

03:13:07.609 --> 03:13:08.310

IT'S NOT MISLEAD THAT WAY ALL

03:13:23.358 --> 03:13:25.260
THE WAY. AND IN RETALIATION

03:13:25.327 --> 03:13:26.461

03:50:49.602 --> 03:50:51.504
TURNAROUND AT THIS POINT. SO

03:50:51.571 --> 03:50:52.772
HAVE YOU TALKED TO THEM ABOUT

03:50:52.838 --> 03:50:54.740
THEIR ABILITY EVEN. HAVE THE

CAPABILITY OF MAKING THIS TYPE

03:50:56.442 --> 03:50:59.478
OF THING EFFECTIVE. IT WE HAVE

03:50:59.545 --> 03:51:01.013

03:51:01.080 --> 03:51:02.448
ALSO WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON

03:51:02.515 --> 03:51:03.683
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THEY'RE

03:51:03.749 --> 03:51:06.719
GOING TO NEED. IT IF SOMETHING

03:51:06.786 --> 03:51:09.488
HAS TO BE ADDED- BUT THERE HAVE

03:51:09.555 --> 03:51:11.190
BEEN COMMUNICATIONS WITH THEM

03:51:11.257 --> 03:51:12.458
SO THEY'LL HAVE TO THE HOT DEAL

03:51:12.525 --> 03:51:15.127
RAMP UP TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS.

03:51:15.194 --> 03:51:16.395

PROVIDED TO THEM IT'S A MATTER

03:51:18.397 --> 03:51:20.733
OF PRO OF INCLUDING IT IN THE

03:51:20.800 --> 03:51:27.974
REPORTING. I THINK. FRAZIER

03:51:28.040 --> 03:51:29.342
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- I

03:51:29.408 --> 03:51:30.376
KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

03:51:30.443 --> 03:51:33.479
BILL FOR A YEAR NOW AND- I KNOW

03:51:33.546 --> 03:51:35.014
THIS IS A CLEAN UP BILL BUT-

03:51:35.081 --> 03:51:36.449
CURRENTLY. AN OUTBREAK AS THREE

03:51:36.515 --> 03:51:38.918
OR MORE CORRECT. IN THIS STATE

03:51:38.985 --> 03:51:40.586
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ABOUT

03:51:40.653 --> 03:51:42.688
LIKE NOT DICTATING WHAT PEOPLE

03:51:42.755 --> 03:51:43.823
CAN AND CAN'T DO RIGHT I MEAN

03:51:43.889 --> 03:51:45.992
WE LIVE AND LET LIVE IN THE

03:51:46.058 --> 03:51:48.060
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THEN

03:51:48.127 --> 03:51:50.463
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD. THE

03:51:50.529 --> 03:51:54.100
BUSINESS ACCOUNTABLE FOUR THANK

03:51:54.166 --> 03:51:54.700
THE PEOPLE WHO OUTSIDE OF THE

03:51:54.767 --> 03:51:57.336
WORKPLACE. AND THREE PEOPLE AND

03:51:57.403 --> 03:51:59.038
WE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS I MEAN

03:51:59.105 --> 03:52:00.673
IN MY DISTRICT HAVE LARGE

03:52:00.740 --> 03:52:02.975
EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES MULTIPLE

03:52:03.042 --> 03:52:03.609
FAMILIES MULTIPLE FROM THE SAME

03:52:03.676 --> 03:52:05.778
FAMILY. IF THEY'RE HANGING OUT

03:52:05.845 --> 03:52:08.147
AT A DINNER. OR IN THE BARBECUE

03:52:08.214 --> 03:52:09.882
IN THE BACKYARD AND THEY BRING

03:52:09.949 --> 03:52:11.350
IT TO THE WORKPLACE. HOW IN

03:52:11.417 --> 03:52:13.953
GOOD FAITH AND WE HOLD THE

03:52:14.020 --> 03:52:15.921
BUSINESS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE- I

03:52:15.988 --> 03:52:17.390
THINK IT'S A HUGE CONCERN WE

03:52:17.456 --> 03:52:19.325
HAVE WITH THIS BECAUSE- WHEN IT

03:52:19.392 --> 03:52:21.994
COMES TO ADD IN MANUFACTURING

03:52:22.061 --> 03:52:24.330
IT IS VERY COMMUNAL. BUT A LOT

03:52:24.397 --> 03:52:24.897
OF FAMILIES THAT WORK VERY

03:52:24.964 --> 03:52:26.799
CLOSELY TOGETHER. IT'S NOT

03:52:26.866 --> 03:52:28.567
NECESSARILY THAT THE BUSINESS

03:52:28.634 --> 03:52:31.404
IS EXPECTED. IF THEY CAN PROVE

03:52:31.470 --> 03:52:33.606
THAT THEY FOLLOWED STATE LOCAL

03:52:33.673 --> 03:52:34.974
AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES TO

03:52:35.041 --> 03:52:36.275
PREVENT THIS SO I DO HAVE SOME

03:52:36.342 --> 03:52:37.610
MAJOR CONCERNS I WOULD LOVE IF

03:52:37.677 --> 03:52:38.844
YOU COULD RESPOND TO THAT. THE

03:52:38.911 --> 03:52:43.449
CAPSULE I THINK THAT WHAT. SIX

03:52:43.516 --> 03:52:44.684
EIGHTY FIVE WAS ABOUT REPORTING

03:52:44.750 --> 03:52:45.985
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT EVERY

03:52:46.052 --> 03:52:47.320
EMPLOYEE KNEW WHEN THEY HAVE

03:52:47.386 --> 03:52:49.655
BEEN EXPOSED. TO COVERT THAT'S

03:52:49.722 --> 03:52:50.356
WHAT'S EXCITING FIGHT WAS

03:52:50.423 --> 03:52:51.891
ABOUT. AND THEN IT WAS

03:52:51.957 --> 03:52:53.726
REQUIRING THE EMPLOYERS TO

03:52:53.793 --> 03:52:55.161
REPORT THAT SO THAT WE COULD

03:52:55.227 --> 03:52:56.829
KNOW WHERE THE OUTBREAKS WORK.

03:52:56.896 --> 03:52:58.030
AND AT THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC

03:52:58.097 --> 03:53:00.232
HEALTH- COULD THEN FIGURE OUT

03:53:00.299 --> 03:53:01.400
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AT THAT

03:53:01.467 --> 03:53:03.602
PARTICULAR EMPLOYERS LOOK

03:53:03.669 --> 03:53:06.572
LOCATION. THERE IS NOTHING

03:53:06.639 --> 03:53:08.174
ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY THIS IS

03:53:08.240 --> 03:53:10.409
NOT TO SAY THAT. THAT THAT THAT

03:53:10.476 --> 03:53:11.777
THE EMPLOYERS RESPONSIBLE OR

03:53:11.844 --> 03:53:13.646
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COVE IT

03:53:13.713 --> 03:53:15.915
IS JUST TALKING ABOUT. MAKING

03:53:15.981 --> 03:53:17.650
SURE THAT THE THAT THE EMPLOYEE

03:53:17.717 --> 03:53:19.085
KNOWS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

03:53:19.151 --> 03:53:21.053
EXPOSED THAT'S IT. WHAT THIS

03:53:21.120 --> 03:53:23.089
DOES IS IT MAKES SURE THAT WE

03:53:23.155 --> 03:53:26.392
SAY IT'S INDUSTRY AND WORKPLACE

03:53:26.459 --> 03:53:27.560
BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS

03:53:27.626 --> 03:53:29.395
PUT IS WHAT. INDUSTRY

03:53:29.462 --> 03:53:32.231
WORKPLACE. AND IF THE ALTHOUGH

03:53:32.298 --> 03:53:34.967
AND IN THE ANALYSIS IT DOES SAY

03:53:35.034 --> 03:53:36.135
AB SIXTY FIVE PROVIDED A

03:53:36.202 --> 03:53:37.603
MECHANISM FOR DEPARTMENT PUBLIC

03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:39.472
HEALTH TO COLLECT. AND PUBLISH

03:53:39.538 --> 03:53:41.807
COBIT NINETEEN OUTBREAKS BY

03:53:41.874 --> 03:53:42.975
WORKPLACE AND INDUSTRY. BUT

03:53:43.042 --> 03:53:44.777
UNFORTUNATELY THAT IT HASN'T

03:53:44.844 --> 03:53:46.512
BEEN DONE SO WE WANT TO CLEAR

03:53:46.579 --> 03:53:48.681
IT UP AND SAY WE ARE EXPECTING

03:53:48.748 --> 03:53:51.484
BOTH INDUSTRY AND WORKPLACE.

03:53:51.550 --> 03:53:53.786
THE SECOND PART TO THIS AND ONE

03:53:53.853 --> 03:53:57.089
OF THE- WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO

03:53:57.156 --> 03:53:59.191
CALLED AND SAID THAT THE

03:53:59.258 --> 03:54:01.060
LANGUAGE DOESN'T INCLUDE YET-

03:54:01.127 --> 03:54:02.194
DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF

03:54:02.261 --> 03:54:03.496
THE DUPLICATION AND THAT IS

03:54:03.562 --> 03:54:05.364
CORRECT IN THE LANGUAGES AND-

03:54:05.431 --> 03:54:06.198
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

03:54:06.265 --> 03:54:08.167
BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WE

03:54:08.234 --> 03:54:09.468
DON'T WANT. ANY OF OUR

03:54:09.535 --> 03:54:11.237
HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE THAT

03:54:11.303 --> 03:54:12.872
ALREADY HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT

03:54:12.938 --> 03:54:14.707
TO REPORT WE DON'T WANT THEM TO

03:54:14.774 --> 03:54:16.842
HAVE TO REPORT TWICE. SO THAT'S

03:54:16.909 --> 03:54:19.311
THE OTHER PART OF THIS CLEAN UP

03:54:19.378 --> 03:54:20.446
BUT IT'S THOSE TWO THINGS ONE

03:54:20.513 --> 03:54:23.315
IS. INDUSTRY AND WORKPLACE SO

03:54:23.382 --> 03:54:25.317
THAT IT ISN'T JUST INDUSTRY ON

03:54:25.384 --> 03:54:26.786
THE REPORTING BUT IT DOESN'T

03:54:26.852 --> 03:54:28.687
SAY WHO'S RESPONSIBLE WHO'S NOT

03:54:28.754 --> 03:54:30.055
RESPONSIBLE IT'S ONLY THE

03:54:30.122 --> 03:54:30.956
REPORTING IT'S ONLY BE

03:54:31.023 --> 03:54:32.992
GATHERING INFORMATION. AND THE

03:54:33.058 --> 03:54:34.193
SECOND PART IS MAKING SURE THAT

03:54:34.260 --> 03:54:36.796
WE'RE NOT REQUIRING ANYBODY TO

03:54:36.862 --> 03:54:38.464
REPORT TWICE BECAUSE GOING TO

03:54:38.531 --> 03:54:40.666
TAKE THEM TOOK TWICE AS LONG IT

03:54:40.733 --> 03:54:42.735
MAY SEEM TO BE THE SAME REPORT.

03:54:42.802 --> 03:54:43.903
BUT IF THEY HAVE TO INPUT IT

03:54:43.969 --> 03:54:45.938
AGAIN IT WE DON'T WE THAT'S

03:54:46.005 --> 03:54:47.773
UNFAIR TO THOSE TWO THAT WAS

03:54:47.840 --> 03:54:49.008
LIKE MEDICAL FACILITIES AND THE

03:54:49.074 --> 03:54:51.577
LIKE TO HELP THEM. PREPARE TWO

03:54:51.644 --> 03:54:54.046
DIFFERENT REPORTS SO ONCE

03:54:54.113 --> 03:54:55.414
SOMETHING HAPPENS RIGHT THERE'S

03:54:55.481 --> 03:54:57.616
A OUTBREAK. AND THEY GET PUT ON

03:54:57.683 --> 03:54:59.685
THIS LIST RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS

03:54:59.752 --> 03:55:01.487
THEN. NOTHING IT'S JUST TO LET

03:55:01.554 --> 03:55:03.556
THE COMMUNITY KNOW THAT THERE

03:55:03.622 --> 03:55:06.125
WAS AN OUTBREAK THERE. AS TO

03:55:06.192 --> 03:55:06.926
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE OR NOT

03:55:06.992 --> 03:55:09.395
RESPONSIBLE THIS BILL AND MY

03:55:09.462 --> 03:55:11.130
PRIOR BILL HAD NOTHING TO DO

03:55:11.197 --> 03:55:13.299
WITH WHO'S RESPONSIBLE IT HAS

03:55:13.365 --> 03:55:15.334
TO DO WITH MAKING SURE THAT A

03:55:15.401 --> 03:55:16.869
WORKER KNOWS THEY'VE BEEN

03:55:16.936 --> 03:55:18.571
EXPOSED. AND MAKING SURE THE

03:55:18.637 --> 03:55:19.805
COMMUNITY KNOWS WHEN THERE'S AN

03:55:19.872 --> 03:55:21.907
OUTBREAK AT ONE OF THE WORK

03:55:21.974 --> 03:55:23.576
PLACES IN THEIR COMMUNITY RIGHT

03:55:23.642 --> 03:55:25.211
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IF WE

03:55:25.277 --> 03:55:27.613
ARE GOING TO PRINT. THE NAME OF

03:55:27.680 --> 03:55:33.052
A BUSINESS ON A- PUBLICATION

03:55:33.118 --> 03:55:33.652
THAT THE COMMUNITY KNOWS. THIS

03:55:33.719 --> 03:55:34.887
IS THAT CAN THAT BUSINESS IS

03:55:34.954 --> 03:55:36.622
BAD THEY'RE GOING TO. A QUOTE

03:55:36.689 --> 03:55:37.723
UNQUOTE BLACKBALLED FOR ONE WAY

03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:40.559
OR THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH. IT'S

03:55:40.626 --> 03:55:42.161
NOT NECESSARILY THEIR FAULT.

03:55:42.228 --> 03:55:43.562
JUST LIKE THE COMMUNITY I WOULD

03:55:43.629 --> 03:55:44.363
NEVER WANT LIKE INDIVIDUALS

03:55:44.430 --> 03:55:45.664
NAMES BEING PRINTED RIGHT THAT

03:55:45.731 --> 03:55:47.967
WOULD BE TERRIBLE. AT THE HIPPA

THESE PROTOCOLS IN DOING THE

03:55:54.573 --> 03:55:56.976
RIGHT THING. I THINK THERE

03:55:57.042 --> 03:55:57.843

03:55:57.910 --> 03:56:00.412
THE FORM BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR

03:56:00.479 --> 03:56:01.780
TO HAVE THEIR NAME GETTING

03:56:03.682 --> 03:56:05.217
THAT THEY CANNOT CONTROL NOW

03:56:05.284 --> 03:56:06.018
THEY'RE BAD ACTORS THAT ARE

03:56:06.085 --> 03:56:08.087
