TO CONTINUE WE'VE WRITTEN ABOUT

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:53.839
IT BEFORE WE'VE DONE ANALYSES

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:56.075
ON IT ALREADY WHEN THE

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:57.843
LEGISLATURE WAS CONSIDERING.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.345
THE WEATHER TO FIND THIS IN THE

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:00.846
FIRST PLACE AND IT'S SOMETHING

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:01.947
THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

00:13:02.014 --> 00:13:03.415
FOLLOW AND PROVIDE YOU WITH

UPDATES IN OUR- FORMAL BUDGET

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:10.956

OTHER UPDATES- TO LET YOU KNOW-

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:19.165
WHAT ARE THE DEVELOPMENTS IN IF

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:21.066
WE SEE SOMETHING THAT SAYS. IT

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:23.269
NEEDS TO BE TAKEN A CLOSE LOOK

00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:25.571
AT OKAY WELL I GUESS I'D SAY IS

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:26.605
AS YOU'RE MONITORING THIS

00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:31.577
PROGRAM- I URGE YOU TO. LOOK AT

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.879
FROM THIS FRAME ALL RIGHT- I

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:34.980
MEAN WE COULD OF COURSE IS THE

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:36.282
LEGISLATURE WE CAN DECIDE HOW

00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:37.483
MUCH MONEY WE GIVE TO THIS AND

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.253
OTHER PROGRAMS. BUT AND I'D

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.254
CERTAINLY I THINK THE FUNDING

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:46.125
THAT. WE PROVIDED FOR EDUCATION

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:49.061
IS WORTHY. THE QUESTION IS THIS

00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:50.696
IS THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEND THE

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:51.664
HUNDRED MILLION PLUS THE TWENTY

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.399
MILLION EVERY YEAR SO AS YOU'RE

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.167
LOOKING AT IS THE LA I WAS

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:57.203
LOOKING AT THIS- I THINK WHEN

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.104
THE FRAME TO LOOK AT IT IS TO

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:01.140
SAY. IS THIS THE BEST WAY TO

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:03.042
SPEND THE MONEY. THE AT AND TO

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:05.444
DRAW A COMPARISON BETWEEN WHAT

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.079
WE'RE GETTING FOR THE

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:08.547
INVESTMENT WILL PUT IN HERE AND

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.716
WHAT WHAT. WHAT WE HAVE GOTTEN

00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:11.350
AND I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE HARD

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:12.785
TO ALWAYS FIGURE THAT OUT IF WE

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:13.919
HAD DECIDED TO PUT THE MONEY IN

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:15.221
OUR EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:16.488
SYSTEM DERRY HAS THE

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:18.357
INFRASTRUCTURE ALL SET UP. THAT

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:20.259
RATE HAS IT CETERA AND YEP

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:21.660
BECAUSE WE USE YOU MENTIONED-

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:24.263
THERE 17% READY ONLINE IN OUR

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.698
EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:28.934
THEY'RE DOING STUFF. SO THE

00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:30.102
QUESTION IS IT MAKES SENSE TO.

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:31.136
BUT ALL THE OVERHEAD AND IT

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:32.972
CETERA FOR THIS AS WE PREPARE

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:34.106
FOR FIGHTING A UNIQUE PRODUCT

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:35.975
THAT COULDN'T BE OBTAINED. BY

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:37.843
OR- WE TOOK THE SAME ABOUT

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.378
MONEY AND GAVE IT TO THE

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:41.080
EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:43.916
TODAY DO THE SAME OR EVEN MORE.

00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:44.984
I MEAN THAT'S A TRUE COMPARISON

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.652
RIGHT IS THIS THE WISEST WAY TO

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:47.620
SPEND THE MONEY ARE YOU GETTING

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:48.621
THE BIGGEST RETURN FOR

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:51.523
INVESTMENT- SO. SO I HOPE THAT

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.524
AS THE ELLIE I WAS MONITORING

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:54.026
THIS IS NOT MERELY LIKE DID YOU

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:55.628
HIT THE STATUTORY DEADLINES.

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:57.796
BUT IS THIS THE BEST WAY WE

00:14:57.863 --> 00:14:59.331
COULD SPEND OUR MONEY- IN TERMS

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.768
OF. EDUCATION FOR AND HE CALLED

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:04.603
SYSTEM YES NIGHT. WE WOULD

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.006
AGREE- AND I WOULD KIND OF ADD

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:10.643

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.676
SOMETHING ELSE. GIVEN THE DISH

00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:06.243
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT THERE

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:07.244
ARE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:07.911
ARE BUILT IN THERE THAT I

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:09.246
THAT'S WHY I ASK IF THERE WAS A

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:11.348
SPECIFIC STUDY. TAILORED TO

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:13.183
CALIFORNIA AND IN PARTICULAR

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:17.121
TO- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:19.256
ONLINE EDUCATION AND BRICK AND

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:20.624
MORTAR EDUCATION THE DIFFERENCE

00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:22.960
BETWEEN COMPETENCY BASED DIRECT

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:24.695

CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:34.238
SYSTEM SO THAT ANSWERED THE

00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:37.141
QUESTION I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:38.442
THERE WAS NOT A MORE SPECIFIC

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:40.177
STUDY THAT RELY ON. AND THE

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:44.515
SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION

00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:45.616
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY STUDIES.

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:48.318
THE DOCUMENT. IN I'M CREED WAY

00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:50.854
ARE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES AND

COLLEGES ARE INADEQUATELY

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:55.325
SERVING. ANY PARTICULAR

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:57.094
DEMOGRAPHIC CAN OUR POPULATION

00:44:57.161 --> 00:44:59.263
BASE AND IN PARTICULAR THE TWO

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:00.998
POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:03.133
BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.234
FOUR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:45:04.301 --> 00:45:06.703
APPARENTLY RELIED ON. IN

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:07.671
PUTTING THE FORMER

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:08.705
ADMINISTRATION IN PUTTING

FORWARD. THIS PROPOSAL. AND YOU

00:45:13.977 --> 00:45:14.478
ALL SHOULD BE AWARE OF IT

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.680
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A TIDY

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:17.915
THAT'S CRITICIZING THE VERY

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:20.184
VERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:24.421
THAT YOU SUPERVISE. YES SO THE

00:45:24.488 --> 00:45:26.857

00:45:30.294 --> 00:45:31.462
SEVERAL OTHER STUDIES THAT HAVE

BEEN DONE ON THE CALIFORNIA

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.467
WORKFORCE SPECIFICALLY. WE ARE

00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:38.402
CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW ENGAGING

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:39.636
WITH THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR

00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:41.505
NEWSOME ON THE FUTURE OF WORK

LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE.

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:46.176
SPECIFICALLY FOR CALIFORNIA AND

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:48.445
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN WAGE GAIN

00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:51.615
AND- AVAILABILITY OF COLLEGE

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:57.321
CREDENTIALS SO- I THINK- WE

00:45:57.387 --> 00:45:59.223
HAVE RELIED HEAVILY AND HAVE

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:01.325
ARGUED TO THE LEGISLATURE THE

00:46:01.391 --> 00:46:02.526
CALIFORNIACOMMITTEE COLLEGES

THE BEST EDUCATION AND- THE

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.568
OPPORTUNITY TO GROW BRICK AND

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:15.873
MORTAR CAPACITY. MOST RECENTLY-

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:18.675
THE GOVERNOR'S- POST SECONDARY

MACKENZIE. THAT WERE

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:26.250
SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT THE

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:28.418
CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE IN THE

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:30.888
CAPACITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:32.756
TO MEET THE DEMAND PARTICULARLY

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:34.124
IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IN THE

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:36.326
CENTRAL VALLEY. THESE ARE TWO

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:37.561
AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE WE

00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:38.929
LACK CAPACITY FROM BOTH THE

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:41.932
PUBLIC. HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:43.600
AND THE NONPROFIT HIGHER

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:46.336
EDUCATION SECTOR. IT IS LED TO

00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:47.671
INITIATIVES LIKE THE FRESNO

00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:49.239

I AT LEAST I AM FIRMLY

00:46:57.214 --> 00:47:00.617
CONVINCED. THAT MY SYSTEM. DOES

00:47:00.684 --> 00:47:01.919
NOT HAVE ALL THE TOOLS

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:04.755
NECESSARY. TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS

00:47:04.821 --> 00:47:06.924
OF PARTICULARLY OF WORKERS WHO

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.725

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:11.128
SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND WHOSE JOBS.

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:12.829

WITH A AYE AND AUTOMATION IN

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:33.550
THE WORK FORCE SO THAT'S- THAT

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:35.519
WAS THE IMPETUS SO- HAS THERE

00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:37.721

DONE JUST ON THIS QUESTION- I

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:42.759

00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:26.516
MISSIONS INCLUDING IN- ESL

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:29.820
INCLUDING- INCARCERATED

00:51:29.886 --> 00:51:31.455
FORMALLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:33.790
FOSTER YOUTH WE CONTINUE TO ASK

00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:35.592
OUR COLLEGES TO DO MORE AND

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:39.029
MORE. IT WAS- OUR ARGUMENT THAT

00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:40.964
WE NEEDED TO BUILD A COLLEGE

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:43.166
JUST TO SERVE ONE POPULATION

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:45.101
AND THEN TO DISSEMINATE THAT

00:51:45.168 --> 00:51:47.137
LEARNING TO ALL OF OUR HUNDRED

00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:47.904
FOURTEEN CALL JUST SO THAT WE

00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:49.606
CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD CAPACITY.

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:51.408
IN THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU USE THE

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:52.542
ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE THE

00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:54.911
ONLINE EDUCATION IN THIS GOAL.

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:59.649
IS TO DEVELOP A- A CORPSE

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:02.052
EXCHANGE FOR ON. EDUCATION SO

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:04.788
THE ANY STUDENT IN THE STATE

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:06.590
CAN TAKE AN ONLINE COURSE AND

00:52:06.656 --> 00:52:09.493
IF THEY CHOOSE TO BE TAKEN INTO

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:13.530
PROBE A STUDY. IT'S BEEN ALL

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:14.130
FIVE YEARS WE STILL HAVE NOT

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:15.632
LEAVE THAT GOAL THAT'S NOT A

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:16.266
CRITICISM OF THE ISLAND.

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:18.702
INITIATIVE THAT'S- AN ISSUE

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:20.704
THAT WE IN THE SYSTEM ARE

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.973
CONTINUE TO BE ASKED TO DO

00:52:23.039 --> 00:52:25.041
SEVERAL THINGS AT ONCE BUT MY

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:26.476
UNDERSTANDING IS FIFTY HIM AS

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:29.045
MY WRONG FIFTY SEVEN OF YOUR-

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:30.180
ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:32.048
COLLEGES ARE PART OF THE-

00:52:32.115 --> 00:52:34.518
ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE.

00:52:34.584 --> 00:52:35.118
FIFTY SEVEN OUR PARTY ONLINE

00:52:35.185 --> 00:52:37.220
EDUCATION INITIATIVE BUT THERE

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:40.357
ARE MUCH LESS COURSES AVAILABLE

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:41.591
ON THE COURSE EXCHANGE IN THE

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:42.893
IN THE REASON FOR THAT IS

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:44.594
BECAUSE WE STILL ARE CHALLENGED

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.130
BY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:51.868
SHARE- F. T. HOW TO SHARE THE

00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:54.204
EXPENSE THE REVENUE ACROSS THE

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:56.806
COLLEGE THEN WE WILL GET THERE.

00:52:56.873 --> 00:52:58.508
BUT BUT THE OTHER THING I WOULD

00:52:58.575 --> 00:52:59.509
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THESE ARE

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:02.279
CONTINUE TO BE TREATED NO

00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:06.149
CORPUS. I WOULD STILL OPEN THE

00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:07.817
SUN ESTHER MY- THERE'S SICK

00:53:07.884 --> 00:53:08.885
TIME. AND WHILE IMPORTANT WE TO

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:09.719
GO BECAUSE- WE HAVE OUR

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:11.221
COMPETITORS CONTINUE TO GROW

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:14.324
THEIR CAPACITY- IN MY MIND THIS

00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:16.126
IS NOT AN EITHER OR SITUATION

00:53:16.192 --> 00:53:18.128
WE NEED BOTH. WE NEED TO

00:53:18.194 --> 00:53:19.195
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE

00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:20.630
STRONG WORK FORCE INITIATIVE

00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:21.331
BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS OUR

00:53:21.398 --> 00:53:23.466
COLLEGES TO WORK IN REGIONS. TO

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:25.068
WORK TOGETHER TO SERVE TO TRY

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:26.636
AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS FOR

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:28.338
REGIONAL WORKFORCE WE NEED TO

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:30.440
CONTINUE TO REACH MORE STUDENTS

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.075
THROUGH THINGS LIKE ONLINE

00:53:32.142 --> 00:53:33.443
EDUCATION INITIATIVE AND THE

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:35.612
INTRODUCTION OF C. B. E. WE ARE

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:37.447
PREPARING REGULATIONS TO GO TO

00:53:37.514 --> 00:53:38.315
THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS THAT

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:40.350
WOULD ALLOW ALL OF FOUR HUNDRED

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:40.984
FOURTEEN COLLEGES IF THEY

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:43.520
CHOOSE TO OFFER C. B. E. IN MY

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:45.155
MIND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:46.957
BUILD. ALL OF LEVELS OF

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:48.959
CAPACITY IN ORDER TO SERVE THE

00:53:49.025 --> 00:53:50.994
NEEDS GROWING NEEDS OF OUR

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.263
WORKFORCE. WELL ONE OF MY

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.364
CONCERNS IS WHETHER WE CAN

00:53:54.431 --> 00:53:55.899
AFFORD TO DO TRACK THIS THING

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:58.568
AND- TRACKS WITH. THE EIGHTEEN

00:53:58.635 --> 00:53:59.769
NINETEEN BUDGET AS I RECALL BUT

00:53:59.836 --> 00:54:02.238
YOU COULD THIRTY FIVE MILLION

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:04.274
DOLLARS IN PROPER. NINETY ONE

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:06.476
TIME TO IMPROVE ONLINE YES

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:08.478
EDUCATION THROUGH ONLINE

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:10.080
EDUCATION INITIATIVE. AND CAN

00:54:10.146 --> 00:54:14.217
LOOK THAT. BUDGET TERM.

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:15.251
INITIATIVE I GUESS FOR THE

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:17.053
ADMIN. MINUS THAT THE PROGRAM

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.490
WAS DESIGNED TO- LEAD THIS

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:21.257
THESE ARE THE WORDS LEAD TO

00:54:21.324 --> 00:54:22.792
SHORT TERM INDUSTRY VALUED

00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:24.361
CERTIFICATES OR CREDENTIALS ARE

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:26.896
PROGRAMS. FOR ENABLE STUDENT IN

00:54:26.963 --> 00:54:28.531
A PATHWAY TO CONTINUE IN THE

00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:30.634
PATHWAY. IN A PATHWAY OFFERED

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:31.901
BY AN EXISTING COLLEGE WAS

00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:32.736
CERTAINLY THE FIRST ONE IS

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:35.038
EXACTLY THE CAL BRIGHT MODEL

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:36.840
ISN'T IT SHORT TERM INTO SHOCK

00:54:36.906 --> 00:54:38.508
VALUE TOO DIFFICULT CREDENTIALS

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:41.711
ARE PROGRAMS. AND IF SO IF THAT

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:43.213
DOESN'T DIFFER FROM CAP BRIDES

00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:48.952
IT'D MISSION. WHAT ARE WE

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:51.888
DOING. SO SENATOR I WOULD ARGUE

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:54.057
THAT IT IS NOT THE SAME AND I

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:56.326
REALIZE THAT THIS IS. SOMETIMES

00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:57.627
A DIFFICULT DISTINCTION BECAUSE

00:54:57.694 --> 00:55:00.263
WE ARE SO USE TO THE MODEL OF

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:01.297
EDUCATION THAT WE ALL

00:55:01.364 --> 00:55:03.033
PARTICIPATED IN. THAT WE ALL

00:55:03.099 --> 00:55:04.801
HAD THE BENEFIT OF GOING TO A

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:06.603
COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY WHETHER

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:08.204
ONLINE OR BRICK AND MORTAR AND

00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:10.340
HAVING THE ABILITY TO PURSUE AN

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:12.175
EDUCATION. THAT REQUIRED

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:13.810
SEVERAL SEMESTERS TO GET

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:15.879
THROUGH. AND EVEN IN THE SHORT

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:17.414
TERM CERTIFICATE MODEL IN THE

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.049
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.850
WE'RE STILL ASKING. OUR

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:23.453
STUDENTS. TO GO THROUGH A

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.056
SERIES OF COURSES OVER A SERIES

00:55:26.122 --> 00:55:28.391
A LENGTH OF TIME TO ACCOMPLISH

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:29.693
AND ACHIEVE A CERTIFICATE THAT

00:55:29.759 --> 00:55:31.928
ROOM. IMPORTANT CREDENTIAL

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:33.863
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.932
LOWER LEVEL OF CREDENTIALING A

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.567
LEVEL CREDENTIALING THAT WE

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:40.170
HAVE NOT STATE BEEN DOING A

00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:41.971
LEVEL OF CREDENTIALS AND THAT

00:55:42.038 --> 00:55:46.009
IS CHARTER TO WE- WORK. WHO

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:53.750
WERE WERE TO WITH. THAT'S THE

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:55.151
TYPE OF CREDENTIAL IN THAT

00:55:55.218 --> 00:55:56.352
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS

00:55:56.419 --> 00:55:58.188
WHO. DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE

00:55:58.254 --> 00:56:00.423
OPPORTUNITY TO DROP WHAT

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:01.658
THEY'RE DOING AND ATTEND ONE OF

00:56:01.725 --> 00:56:03.193
OUR COLLEGES SO THIS WILL MAKE

00:56:03.259 --> 00:56:05.295
US MORE FLEXIBLE NOT LESS

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:08.264
FLEXIBLE. TO MORE CALIFORNIANS

00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:10.133
BELLE ISLE NOTE ON THIS.

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.501
ATTACHED TO THE THIRTY FIVE

00:56:11.568 --> 00:56:12.535
MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT

00:56:12.602 --> 00:56:14.370
INITIATIVE IT OUR ANALYSIS

00:56:14.437 --> 00:56:16.473
INDICATES SEVENTY QUALIFYING

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:18.374
PROJECTS WERE FUNDED OUT OF A

00:56:18.441 --> 00:56:21.377
HUNDRED APPLICATIONS DESIGNED

00:56:21.444 --> 00:56:22.378
TO CREATE FOUR HUNDRED AND

00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:24.347
SEVEN NEW OR IMPROVED FULLY

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:25.749
ONLINE PROGRAMS LEADING THE

00:56:25.815 --> 00:56:27.250
HIGHER WAGE EMPLOYMENT. I

00:56:27.317 --> 00:56:29.385
REALIZE THIS ISN'T YOU AND THIS

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:30.754
IS WASN'T YOUR INITIATIVE I

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.388
DON'T THINK BUT SOMEBODY FROM

00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:33.656
THE OUTSIDE LOOKING AT THIS

00:56:33.723 --> 00:56:35.158
WOULD PROBABLY THINK WE AREN'T

00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:37.527
VERY WELL ORGANIZED. IN THIS

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:39.395
STATE IS JUST AN OBSERVATION

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:39.963
AND I WOULD MAKE LET ME MOVE%

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:42.899
TO. EMPLOYERS AND IT SEEMS TO

00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:45.301
ME BASED ON WHAT'S BEEN SAID

00:56:45.368 --> 00:56:45.869
AND CERTAINLY WHAT I'VE READ

00:56:45.935 --> 00:56:48.938
THAT THE LYNCH PIN IN THIS

00:56:49.005 --> 00:56:50.140
PROCESS IS THE EMPLOYER

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:52.242
COMMUNITY AND I FRANKLY Q.

00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:52.876
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT

00:56:52.942 --> 00:56:54.778
WHETHER OUR- CUSTOMERS ARE

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:56.513
EMPLOYERS OR OUR CUSTOMERS OUR

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.114
STUDENTS AT THIS POINT AND

00:56:58.181 --> 00:56:59.015
I'LL- I'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:01.317
TO GO TO THAT IN A MINUTE BUT-

00:57:01.384 --> 00:57:04.220
WHAT. WHAT NEEDS BASED STUDY

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:07.223
WAS CONDUCTED AROUND THIS STATE

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.325
OF HIM OF EMPLOYERS NOW. TO

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:10.960
DETERMINE THE NEED FOR A

00:57:11.027 --> 00:57:12.629
COMMUNITY BASED- TRAINING

00:57:12.695 --> 00:57:15.465
PROGRAM. THE ONE WE'VE EMBARKED

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:20.804
ON TO INITIATING THIS EFFORT IN

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:22.071
TWENTY EIGHTEEN OTHER WORDS

00:57:22.138 --> 00:57:24.908
WHAT EMPLOYERS WORK OR STUDY

00:57:24.974 --> 00:57:28.912
INDEPENDENTLY. AND WHO STUCK

00:57:28.978 --> 00:57:30.780
THEIR HAND UP AND SAID LET ME

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:33.082
SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE I NEED

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:36.286
THIS GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE

00:57:36.352 --> 00:57:40.490
INDUSTRY THAT. PROBABLY IS MORE

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:42.292
TRAINING INTENSIVE THAN ANY

00:57:42.358 --> 00:57:44.294
OTHER AND IT'S JUST WEST OF

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.361
HERE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF

00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:46.863
CALIFORNIA. MUCH OF THAT

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.431
INDUSTRY HAS OR HAS OUR OWN AND

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:49.933
HAS THEIR OWN INTERNAL TRAINING

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:51.367
PROGRAMS WHETHER IT'S COOL OR

00:57:51.434 --> 00:57:53.970
WHATEVER- INTUITIVE COULD

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.538
PROGRAMS THAT THEY OFFER BOTH

00:57:55.605 --> 00:57:56.706
FOR THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES

00:57:56.773 --> 00:57:59.409
EMPLOYEES AND OTHER- PLACES OF

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:01.544
EMPLOYMENT. CENTER FOR QUESTION

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:03.813
YES NO ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.315
IF YOU PICK UP THE PAPER ANY

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:07.383
DAY OF THE WEEK YOU SEE ONE

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:09.052
MORE EMPLOYER ONE MORE LARGE

00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:10.620
EMPLOYER WHETHER IT'S DISNEY

00:58:10.687 --> 00:58:15.158
WALMART- DISCOVERED CHIPOTLE

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:19.062
ALL INVESTING IN EMPLOYER LED

00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:20.630
TRAINING PROGRAM. FOR THEIR

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:22.732
WORK FORCE SO I THINK ONE THAT

00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:25.568
SPEAKS TO THE TREMENDOUS DEMAND

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:28.204
TO THAT SPEAKS TO. THE LUCK OF

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:30.874
CAPACITY EMPLOYERS HE AND I

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:34.410
PUBLIX. OF OTHERWISE THEY

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:35.044
WOULDN'T BE IN IN THE OWN

00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:37.347
PROGRAM SO WOULD RATHER SEE THE

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:39.482
INVEST IN OUR PROGRAMS I WOULD

00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:40.850
RATHER SEE THEM INVEST THAT

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:43.419
MONEY IN THE PUBLIC SYSTEMS-

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:46.155
NOW SO WHICH EMPLOYERS SHOULD

00:58:46.222 --> 00:58:50.360
WE TALKED WE TALKED TO- IT IS A

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:51.861
LARGE LIST OF EMPLOYERS

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:52.962
INCLUDING EMPLOYER

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:54.697
ORGANIZATIONS FROM THE BAY AREA

LA CHAMBER SAN DIEGO SAN

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:04.741
FRANCISCO. MANY MANY MANY

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:06.242
EMPLOYER GROUPS THAT WE HAVE

00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:08.678
MET WITH THEY CONTINUE TO BE

KAISER DIGNITY HEALTH SUTTER.

00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:28.731
AND OTHERS. AND AN IMPORTANT

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:30.733
DISTINCTION HERE IS THAT WE ARE

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.835
NOT JUST FOCUS ON EMPLOYERS. WE

00:59:32.902 --> 00:59:35.405
ARE NOT- GIVING EMPLOYERS MORE

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:37.540
OF A HAND IN THIS DESIGN. THEN

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:40.710
WE ARE WORKERS IT IS AN EQUAL

00:59:40.777 --> 00:59:43.379
AMOUNT OF SUPPORT WE CONTINUE

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:44.847
TO REACH OUT TO AND WORK WITH

00:59:44.914 --> 00:59:47.550
OUR LABOR PARTNERS WHO SEE THIS

00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:49.719
AS A CRITICAL ISSUE. WHETHER

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:52.255
WE'RE TALKING TO- AS YEAH YOU

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:53.556
YOU H. W. S. YEAH YOU IN

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:57.327
GENERAL- CSEA OTHER

00:59:57.393 --> 00:59:59.495
ORGANIZATIONS THAT SEE THE NEED

00:59:59.562 --> 01:00:00.997
NOW THERE IS A CHALLENGE WITH

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:03.166
EMPLOYERS. BECAUSE OF EMPLOYERS

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:05.668
DO NOT FEEL THAT CAL BRIDE IS

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:07.337
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HERE FOR

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:08.237
THE NEXT THREE YEARS AS

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:10.707
DIFFICULT TO LAND. A FIRM

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.976
PARTNERSHIP. BUT NONE THE LESS

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:13.843
THERE ARE PARTNERSHIPS THAT

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.511
ARE. HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:17.914
CONTINUE TO BE DEVELOPED THE

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:18.448
THREE PATHWAYS THAT WERE

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:21.551
DETERMINED- WHEN WE CAME BEFORE

01:00:21.617 --> 01:00:23.019
YOU THE FIRST TIME THE THREE

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:24.520
PATHWAYS ARE DETERMINED.

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:26.222
BECAUSE OF THE EMPLOYER DEMAND

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.790
AND BECAUSE OF THE LABOR

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:29.292
ORGANIZATION DEMAND THAT'S HOW

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.561
THEY CAME INTO EXISTENCE- SO WE

01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:33.997
WILL CONTINUE TO ROUTE. I SAY

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:36.199
WIKI IS BECAUSE THIS IS

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.300
SOMETHING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:40.670
DOES THIS IS IN OUR DNA EXPECT

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:42.038
CALIBRATED TO THE SECOND THING.

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:44.207
IS LEVEL OF CREDENTIALS AS WE

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:47.176
ASK MUST TURN YOUR COLLEGE WITH.

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:48.544
US AND YOU ME BECAUSE THIS MARK

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:51.614
MY FORMER COLLEGE BEACH COLLEGE

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:54.183
WE SEE THIS ADDING TO PASSIVELY

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.518
WELL I HAVE SOME WORK. ON THIS

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:59.255

WOULD GO BACK TO ALLOW BIT THE

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:16.005
ISSUE OF. TARGET OF WORKERS

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:18.708
BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY FOUR

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:21.377
THIRTY FIVE ON THE UNDERSERVED-

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:23.346
CALIFORNIA'S WORK FORCES ABOUT

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:26.315
HALF LATINO. AND THE MEAT THAT

01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:29.085
PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION UP BUT

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.521
THE CAL BRIGHT OF COLLEGE

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:37.460
ENROLLMENT SO FAR- IS LESS THAN

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.395
THIS MAN THE LATINO ENROLLMENT

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:44.200
IS LESS THAN 20% AND THEN 25%

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:46.135
OF ENROLLEES HAVE ALREADY

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:48.838
OBTAINED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE SO

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:53.376
HOW DOES THAT. DR HOW DOES THAT

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:55.678
MATCH WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:58.881
THE MISSION OF CAL BRIGHT. I

01:01:58.948 --> 01:01:59.515
MEAN LET ME TAKE THEM IN FOR-

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:02.585
FIRST OF ALL YOU KNOW THIS IS A

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:05.888
PILOT- COVERT IT'S THE FIRST

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.356
WAVE OF PEOPLE BUT ALSO THERE

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.958
IS- IMPORTANTLY THERE WAS A AN

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:10.560
ERROR IN THE CALCULATION

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:12.028
ORIGINALLY THAT. THE PERCENT

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:15.465
OF- LENNIX- ENROLLEES IS OVER

01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:17.800
30% IT'S- IN THE MID THIRTIES

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:20.503
AND- WE APOLOGIZE FOR NOT

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:21.838
HAVING THAT ACCURATELY AT THE

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:25.908
BEGINNING- BUT THE- IN TERMS OF

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:29.112
THE 25% BEING- HAVE A

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:31.614
BACHELOR'S DEGREE. WE'VE HEARD

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.282
SOME. SO TALK THAT THERE ARE A

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:34.951
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITHIN THE

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:36.119
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WHO

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:38.020
HAVE. SIGNED UP FOR CALIBRATED

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:39.489
TO SEE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT AND

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:41.057
WE THINK THAT MAY HAVE- PERHAPS

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:43.392
THROWN OFF THE- THE EDUCATIONAL

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:44.460
ATTAINMENT OF THIS OF THIS

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.162
INITIAL COHORT. WE DON'T KNOW

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:49.365
FOR SURE BUT- THAT'S JUST-

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:50.733
THINGS THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.668
BUT YOU KNOW OUR OUR- OUR

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:54.804
INTENT AS WE AS WE MARKET MORE

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:58.207
BROADLY AND- AND GROW THAT THAT

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.243
WE- WE WERE. COMPLETELY

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:02.411
CONVINCED THAT WE WILL HAVE A-

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:03.880
YOU KNOW BE REACHING THE TARGET

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:06.015
AUDIENCE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF.

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:07.517
PROGRAMS IN PLACE BOTH BOTH

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:10.586
JUST- DIRECTED. OUT REACH TO

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:11.420
TWO GROUPS THAT WORK CLOSELY

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.222
WITH THOSE POPULATIONS AS WELL

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:16.192
AS- AS A TARGETED ONLINE-

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:19.295
MARKETING- PLAN THAT THAT WE

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:20.863
THINK WILL REACH THEM WHERE

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:23.299
THEY ARE AND THEN WAIT. THE

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:25.635
PAPER SEE THE OUR MISSION SO

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:26.802
WITHIN THAT WILL WILL CHANGE

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:27.637
OVER TIME IN I CAN'T REPEAT

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:29.372
ENOUGH THAT THIS I MEAN WHICH

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:31.274
LAUNCHED A FEW MONTHS AFTER

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:34.076
UNITED AFTER GETTING THE AFTER

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:34.810
EVEN AND ANNOUNCING IN NAME IN

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.445
THAT. SO THERE'S A LONG WAY TO

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:37.914
GO TO- TO ENHANCE OUR

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.815
VISIBILITY- IN THE COMMUNITIES

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:42.185
THAT WE WANT TO REACH AND THAT

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:44.120
WE ARE DEDICATED TO DOING THAT

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:47.089
SO- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:49.592
IS HOW ARE YOU MAKING SURE THAT

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:52.728
CAO BREAKS OUR RECRUITMENT

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:54.297
PLANS ARE NOT. POACHING THE

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:56.999
STUDENT. THAT OTHERWISE WOULD

01:03:57.066 --> 01:04:00.836
HAVE UTILIZE THE ONLINE. US

01:04:00.903 --> 01:04:02.505
EIGHTY UP PROGRAM OFFERED BY

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:04.807
COMMITTEE COLLEGES. THE AT THE

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:06.008
INSTRUCTION THAT WE'RE OFFERING

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:08.377
IS VERY DIFFERENT IN IN BOTH

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:11.280
FORM AND SUBSTANCE IT'S- AS

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:13.783
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT- YOU CAN

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:14.650
START AND STOP WHENEVER YOU

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:16.986
WANT- YOU PROGRESS AT YOUR OWN

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:22.258
PACE. AND IN ITS- IS OFFERING

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:24.026
IT IS NOT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:25.428
LOOKING FOR DEGREES AS MOST

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:26.262
PEOPLE WHO GO TO A COMMUNITY

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.197
COLLEGE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. TO

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:29.899
BUILD CREDITS TOWARD A DEGREE

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:31.000
THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS IS FOR

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:33.069
THIS IS. TO OBTAIN JOB SKILLS

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:34.503
TO MOVE UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.306
FROM FROM WHERE YOU ARE SO- IT

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:39.375
IT'S A DIFFERENT PURPOSE AND A

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:40.610
DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY THEN AND

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:42.011
THEN OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:43.980
ARE USING AND I DO WANT TO ADD

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:45.481
THAT. WE THINK THIS WILL IN THE

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:48.017
LONG RUN BENEFIT ALL THE-

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:51.387
COLLEGES BECAUSE WE'RE- A

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:52.588
VEHICLE FOR EXPERIMENTATION AND

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:54.357
LEARNING HOW TO DO. WHAT AND AS

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:56.225
WITH THAT WE CAN SHARE THAT-

01:04:56.292 --> 01:05:01.530
THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH. THE BASE

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:02.965
PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR AND

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:05.835
WE ALL WILL SHARE- ALSO IN OUR

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:07.570
IN OUR OUT REACH TO EMPLOYERS

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.038
FOR INSTANCE- WITH WE FIND AN

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:10.940
EMPLOYER HAS GREAT NEEDS IN

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:12.041
CALIBRATING TO START WITH A

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:13.476
VERY SMALL. STUDENT POPULATION

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.177
YOU CAN PUT IN. A STEEP TO BE

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:16.445
TRYING TO GET OTHER COMMUNITY

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:18.314
COLLEGES TO TAKE THE JOBS THAT

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:19.882
THAT WITH THE STATEWIDE

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:21.417
EMPLOYERS THAT WERE- THAT WE'RE

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:22.652
TRYING TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS

01:05:22.718 --> 01:05:26.055
WITH. IF I CAN ADD SENATOR I'D

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:28.424
I THINK. YOU KNOW A AN

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:30.559
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IS YOU

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.161
KNOW AS YOU MENTIONWHO WHO IS

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:33.663
CAL BRIGHT TARGETING RESEARCH

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:34.997
WHO IS. OUR OUR TRADITIONAL

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:36.766
COMMITTEE CALLED IS TARGETING.

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:39.268
AND I THINK- THAT CERTAINLY OUR

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:40.803
EXPECTATION CHANGES OFFICE TO

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:42.405
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:43.506
ABOUT WHO THEY SHOULD BE

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:45.141
TARGETING. THEY SHOULD BE

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:45.841
WORKING WITH AND I THINK THE

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:48.778
MORE- LABOR PARTNERSHIPS THAT

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:49.912
ARE CREATED WITH CALIBRATED

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:51.013
THINK THE MORE THAT YOU'LL SEE

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.848
THAT TARGET CONTINUE TO. BE

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:56.786
REFINED- I ALSO THINK. THAT YOU

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:58.454
KNOW. WE ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:01.223
SO WE CANNOT DENY ENROLLMENT.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.659
TO ANY COLLEGE I MEAN YOU'RE-

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:06.028

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.806
COLLEGES IN LAS CHANGES WORK

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:19.008
WELL TOGETHER. TO SERVE THE

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:20.242

MORE THINGS TO DO BUT BUT I

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.654
CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THAT WE'RE

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:20.256
JUST IN THE VERY VERY EARLY

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:22.191
STAGES OF THIS I MEAN LITERALLY

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:24.260

THAT THEY'VE BEEN- THAT THEY'RE

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:50.052
THERE FOR. YEAH I JUST FINALLY-

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:51.654
ON THE ON THE ISSUE THAT I'VE I

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.989
KNOW WITH. SENATOR ROTH IS

01:09:54.056 --> 01:09:55.424
ALREADY KIND OF ALREADY PRETTY

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:57.726
MUCH **** BUT- I STILL DON'T

01:09:57.793 --> 01:09:58.994
UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO HAVE A

01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:02.164
SEPARATE ENTITY. A I UNDERSTAND

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:03.699
THE DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:06.502
MODEL- AND YOU KNOW I THINK

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:08.070
THAT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE A

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.271
DIFFERENT LEVEL OF. A

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:10.940
CERTIFICATE AND THEN THE

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:13.309
DEGREES. BUT WHY IT HAS TO BE A

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:17.246
SEPARATE ENTITY- THAT PART I

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:19.348
DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE- OUR

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:20.316
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE MADE FOR

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:23.285
WORKING PEOPLE. THEY ARE MADE

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:24.853
FOR MEN AND WOMEN YOUNGER OLDER

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.523
DOESN'T MATTER- I CAN BE IN A

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:29.091
ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE DOESN'T

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:30.526
MATTER WHERE WHO THEY ARE. YOU

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:31.994
ASK HIM. DID YOU EVER TAKE

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:33.562
COMMITTEE COLLEGE COURSE SOME

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:35.130
OF THEM. GRADUATED WITH A

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:37.166
DEGREEMOST OF THEM DIDN'T

01:10:37.232 --> 01:10:39.234
BECAUSE THEY USED IT TO ENHANCE

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:41.570
THEIR SKILL. SO I'VE ALWAYS

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:44.673
SAYING. COMEY CALLED AS A REAL

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.709
SWORD CALLED BY COLOR BUT REAL

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:48.978
WORKINGCLASS. AT BASICALLY

01:10:49.044 --> 01:10:51.513
BECAUSE- IT'S SO CHEAPER. THAN

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:55.250

AN UNCERTAIN RULES THAT THIS

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:23.612
KIND OF LIKE THE A CHARTER

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:26.649
SCHOOL YOU KNOW AND WE DIDN'T

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:30.552
ASK AND EXPECT ON IN THAT WHOLE

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:33.956
DEBATE OUT WE USED IT TO SAY

01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:35.891

INNOVATIVE LET'S FIND A

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:40.829
DIFFERENT WAY REACHING ARE

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.665
WORKING CLASS ON COMMUNITIES

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:45.367
WHICH I THINK IS GREAT I THINK

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:46.502
IT'S GREAT THAT YOU EVEN

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:49.405
BROUGHT THAT UP. BUT OF THE

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.874
DOESN'T YET TO ME JUSTIFY

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.844
HAVING A SEPARATE ENTITY- AND A

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:59.448
SEPARATE GOVERNING A SYSTEM OF

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:02.651
IT'S JUST NOT. CLICKING UP AND

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:05.220
I KNOW THAT YOU JUST STARTED

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:07.523

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:11.093
YOU MADE- AND IT'S NOT QUITE

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.162
CLEAR YET FOR EXAMPLE HI GOING

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:14.630
TO GET ALL THOSE EMPLOYERS WELL

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:16.331
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN UP FRONT

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:17.766
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.535
THE INITIAL DEAL UP FRONT BUT-

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:21.070
IT MAYBE YOU COULD JUST ADDRESS

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:24.640
THAT CONCERN. I'M NOT. YES NO

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:26.075
NO I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:30.512
QUESTIONS SENATOR PARTICULARLY.

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:31.847
YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY THE WORD

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:34.049
USED TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:36.085
LOOKS LIKE TO YOU- IN TERMS OF

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:37.820
A CHARTER LET ME BE VERY CLEAR

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:40.322
AND TRANSPARENT WE ARE IN NO

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:43.292
WAY SHAPE OR FORM INTERESTED IN

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:45.494
CREATING A CHARTER COMMUNITY

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:48.697
COLLEGE THIS ENTITY WAS CREATED

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:50.699
SPECIFICALLY IN THIS WAY SO

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:56.138
THAT IT WOULD BE. EXACTLY LIKE-

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:56.705
ONE OF OUR OTHER SEVENTY TWO

01:12:56.772 --> 01:13:00.809
DISTRICTS. SUBJECT TO- ENSURING

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:02.745
THAT OUREMPLOYEES ARE

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:06.782
REPRESENTED. SUBJECT TO THE

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:09.351
SAME RULES UNDER TITLE FIVE IN

01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:11.920
THE EDUCATION CODE AND THIS WAS

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:13.255
IN AND I TAKE THIS VERY

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:14.089
PERSONALLY BECAUSE THIS IS

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:15.557
SOMETHING A COMMITMENT I MADE

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.960
PERSONALLY TO OUR LABOR

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:22.798
PARTNERS CTA C. F. T. S. C. R.

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:25.400
U. C. S. C. A. ON ON DOWN THE

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:27.703
LINE. I MADE VERY CLEAR AND I

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:28.804
THINK GOVERNOR BROWN AND

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:30.272
CERTAINLY GOVERNOR NEWSOME ALL

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:31.974
ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.343
THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.779
CHARTER COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT IS

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:38.147
A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:40.649
ABSOLUTELY. THE REASON WE FELT

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:41.884
IT NEEDED TO BE A SEPARATE

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:42.918
ENTITIES BECAUSE IT IS

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.653
DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.487
NEED TO ESTABLISH A NEW

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:46.555
BARGAINING UNIT AGREEMENT THAT

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:50.225
HAS VERY DIFFERENT. WHY ROLES

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:51.360
IN. ROLES IT WILL SET A

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:54.229
BLUEPRINT FOR HOW TO DO THIS IN

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:56.999
IN OTHER DISTRICTS IT WILL SET-

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:58.700
GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY. TO

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:00.803
QUICKLY- DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:02.571
THAT CAN BE EASILY SHARED WITH

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:03.672
OTHER COLLEGES THAT IS THE

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:06.308
INTENT IN AND IF THAT INTENT

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.811
HAS NOT BEEN MADE CLEAR. IN THE

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:09.578
FIRST FEW MONTHS I CAN ASSURE

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:10.646
YOU THAT IS FROM THE INTENT

01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:11.413
THAT WE IN THE CHANCELLOR'S

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.582
OFFICE EXPECT. TO CALIBRATE BUT

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:16.351
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IT WILL

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:18.487
WHILE IT WILL BE DIFFERENT WELL

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:19.054
IT WILL DO DIFFERENT THINGS

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.857
AND- OF MORE CALIFORNIANS. WE

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:23.692

CONTINUOUSLY OVERSEE OTHER

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:25.080
ENTITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE MY OWN

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:27.782
EXPERIENCE IN THE UC- THEY

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:29.851
OVERSEE THE NATIONAL LABS THEY

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:30.852
OVERSEE A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:21:30.919 --> 01:21:32.320
ENTITIES OR SEPARATELY

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:34.689
INCORPORATED- AND IT DOES

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:38.059
REQUIRE A LOT OF TIME- SO. THE

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:40.629
STRUCTURE IS. ULTIMATELY UNIQUE

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:43.632
BUT I DO I DO APPRECIATE. THAT

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:44.833
THIS HAS TAKEN A LOT OF TIME OF

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:47.435
THE BOARD MEMBERS ALSO IT IS

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:48.803
NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE BOARD OF

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:49.571
NURSING HAVE A SEPARATE

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.106
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:53.308
COLLEGE DISTRICT IT HAS A-

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:57.679
TIME. IN OVER. COME TO BECAUSE-

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:01.783
THE CITY PURCHASED OKAY BECAUSE.

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:03.418
IT PROVIDING TO OVERSIGHT FOR

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:03.985
OVER OF THE BROUGHT TO COME

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:05.854
BECAUSE- SO IT DOES HAVE THAT

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.856
EXPERIENCE ANY CAN CONTINUE TO

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:08.923
DO THAT WITHOUT HAVING A

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:10.558
CONFLICT. FOR THE OVERALL

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:12.627
HEALTH OF THE OF THE SYSTEM BUT

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:14.362
I DO BELIEVE IS A FAIR QUESTION

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:16.531
IT AND SOME THE LEGISLATURE

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:17.565
SHOULD CONSIDER APPRECIATE I

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:19.734
WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT AT YOU SEE

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:20.735
WHICH WERE I WAS FORMALLY

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:22.437
FACULTY MEMBER. THE NATIONAL

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:23.471
LABS ARE DIFFERENT AND THE

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:25.440
INDIVIDUAL EDUCATIONAL CAMPUSES

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:29.110
SO YES I GET THAT BUT WHICH SO.

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:30.812
I'M NOT SURE. EXACTLY THE SAME

01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:32.914
THIS IS A DESERT ADDITIONAL

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:36.451
EDUCATION INSTITUTION. VERSUS

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:38.920
THAT SO THAT'S IN. COMPETITIONS

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:41.289
RIGHT WORD BUT CERTAINLY. MAYBE

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:43.425
I ATTENTION THE DUPLICATION OF

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:45.593
THE OTHER ONES- AS AND WE WON'T

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.362
REHASH TO DUPLICATE AN ISSUE-

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.531
THE OTHER THE OTHER SO THE

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:51.833
OTHER QUESTION I HAVE- SEVEN

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.868
LISTEN CAREFULLY RAISING WILL

01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:54.903
WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE COLLEGE.

01:22:54.969 --> 01:22:58.306
RIGHT AND- SO ONE THAT AT ONE

01:22:58.373 --> 01:23:00.675
POINT THAT WAS EMPHASIZED QUITE

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:04.813
A BIT. WAS AND I MESSAGES FOR

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.348
THE NEXT PANEL FOR THEM TO BE

01:23:06.414 --> 01:23:09.184
ABLE TO ANSWER. IN TWO. WELL

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:10.285
THIS THAT YOU CAN DO YOUR OWN.

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:11.720
AT SO FORTH YOU KNOW THAT

01:23:11.786 --> 01:23:13.688
DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A TIME AND

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:15.223
IT BUT I STILL DON'T QUITE

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:17.325
UNDERSTAND WHY A YOU HAVE TO

01:23:17.392 --> 01:23:18.159
CREATE A WHOLE SEPARATE COLLEGE

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:19.861
BILL DO THIS WHY CAN'T THE

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.363
EXISTING COLLEGES DO THAT IS

01:23:21.429 --> 01:23:22.364
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MAIN

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:24.566
ARGUMENT. AS TO WHY WE NEED TO

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:26.501
HAVE A SEPARATE COLLEGE AND

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:28.203
HAVE SEPARATE COURSES BECAUSE-

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:29.904
WE CAN'T WORK ON A COMMITTEE ON

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.506
A SEMESTER SYSTEM AND PEOPLE

01:23:31.573 --> 01:23:32.273
SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDER OWN

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.576
PACE. AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:37.011
BE. AND MAYBE I MISUNDERSTAND

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:40.749
AND SOME OUT BARRIER TO. MY

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:41.416
COURSES BE DONE THROUGH OUR

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:44.686
OTHER. COLLEGES SO THAT WE HAVE

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:45.220
TO CREATE A WHOLE SEPARATE

01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:48.523
COLLEGES TO DO THAT. IT'S A

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:50.191
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY IT'S A

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:53.161
DIFFERENT CURRICULUM- IT'S- IT

01:23:53.228 --> 01:23:54.829
IT REQUIRES DIFFERENT CONTRACTS

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:56.798
WITH- WITH FACULTY BECAUSE

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:58.500
THEY'D BE TEACHING SO I JUST

01:23:58.566 --> 01:24:00.568
THE BECAUSE AND I APOLOGIZE-

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:02.137
BUT JUST AS WE GET TO THE POINT

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:05.407
SO USING THE FACULTY REFUSING

01:24:05.473 --> 01:24:07.509
TO DO THIS- I'M I'M NOT SAYING

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:08.309
THAT I'M JUST. SAYING WHAT

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.111
DISTINGUISHES. YOU KNOW IT AND

01:24:10.178 --> 01:24:11.546
WHY IT'S DIFFERENT THE AND

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:14.082
ALSO. YOU KNOW IT DOES IT'S A

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:15.583
FAST CHANGING FIELD IT GIVES US

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.185
AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIMENT IN

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:18.820
A IN A WHOLLY FOCUSED WAY WITH

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:21.489
IT WITH MINISTRATION IT'S- YOU

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:23.191
KNOW LEADERSHIP OF THE COLLEGE

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:26.194
FOCUSED ON. ALL THOSE AT THE-

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:28.363
AN ABLE TO A- REACHED STATEWIDE

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:30.098
CAN EMPLOYERS. AND STUDENTS IN

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:32.801
A IN A WAY THAT A THAT A LOCAL

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:33.935
DISTRICT IT WOULD HAVE MORE

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:38.840
MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY. AND HE

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:44.245
THE- END IT IS A IN A IS A-

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:45.180
FOR THE STUDENTS THAN THAN WHAT

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:47.148
MOST COMMUNITY COLLEGES- OFFER

01:24:47.215 --> 01:24:49.918
TODAY. ALL RIGHT IT'S OKAY I

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:52.620
GOT YOU.GOT THAT BUT I JUST

01:24:52.687 --> 01:24:54.088
WONDERED WE NEED TO HAVE A

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:54.722
WHOLE SEPARATE COLLEGE FOR THAT

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:57.492
SO. BECAUSE WE'RE SPENDING A

01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:58.526
LOT OF TIME IN I MEAN. THE

01:24:58.593 --> 01:24:59.727
EFFORT AND WE CAN SEE THIS

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:00.995
REPORT HOW MANY YEARS IS GOING

01:25:01.062 --> 01:25:01.996
TO TAKE ITS AT OUR- AND

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:04.098
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE HAD A

01:25:04.165 --> 01:25:04.899
HUNDRED MILLION AND ALLEN

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:07.802
TWENTY MILLION EVERY YEAR- AND-

01:25:07.869 --> 01:25:10.071
AT NIGHT I GUESS. I'M STILL

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:12.106
LIKE IT SO. I STILL UNDERSTAND

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:14.709
WHY. EXISTING PROGRAMS CAN'T DO

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.978
THE SAME THING- THE OTHER

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:20.048
QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT- AND I

01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:22.217
KNOW THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:23.551
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO PREPARE.

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:25.687
FOR JOBS BUT WHAT I HEARD

01:25:25.753 --> 01:25:27.889
YOU'RE SAYING ALTHOUGH IT. IN

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:29.591
THE REPORT I SEEM TO GET SOME

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:31.159
EXPRESS IT IS. THE PART OF THIS

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:34.762
COLLEGE. NOT THE GROUP. IT'S

01:25:34.829 --> 01:25:35.930
REALLY ABOUT THE CERTIFICATE

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:37.232
THAT YOU CAN GET SO WE'RE NOT

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:39.667
LOOKING A FULL DEGREES SO.

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:40.668
ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT THERE WAS

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:43.238
SOME GOAL TO ESTABLISH DEGREES

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:44.839
SO THAT SEEMS TO BE ALONE

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:47.509
CONFLICT HERE- THAT THIS WAS A

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:48.943
WHILE THE REST OF THE COLLEGES

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:50.044
OF FOLKS SOME PEOPLE GETTING

01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:51.679
THEIR DEGREES ARE ALTHOUGH WE

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:53.114
DO KNOW THAT MANY OF ACTUALLY

01:25:53.181 --> 01:25:54.749
MANY PEOPLE GO TO THEIR LOCAL

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:55.783
COMMITTEE COLLEGE NOT FOR

01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:58.419
DEGREES BUT- OKAY. THAT THEY'RE

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.321
MORE FOCUSED DEGREES THIS ONE'S

01:26:00.388 --> 01:26:02.790
MORE ABOUT CERTIFICATE. AND IN

01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:04.592
MANY WAYS I GUESS THE

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.628
CLARIFICATION IS THAT IT'S NOT

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:07.929
SO MUCH I MEAN MAYBE THEY'LL

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:10.298
HELP THEM GET A NEW JOB.

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:11.332
BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT THIS FOR

01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:13.468
PEOPLE ARE WORKING A READY. I

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:16.404
ASSUME THIS WOULD PERHAPS BE

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:16.971
MORE FOCUSED ON HELP PEOPLE

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:19.274
HAVE FIGURE SKILL SETS FOR

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:20.141
PROMOTIONS THAT MAKE THEIR

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:22.744
MEASURE THAT AND SAYING BECAUSE

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:26.247
THREE WORKING RIGHT NOW THEY

THIS YEAR'S TALKING ABOUT IT. I

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:56.144
WON'T BE SURE WERE USING THE

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.880
RIGHT METRIC TO MEASURE WHAT IS

01:26:58.947 --> 01:27:00.081
SIXTY THE SUCCESS OF THESE

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:01.082

CREATED THIS AND WHAT WERE THE

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:17.465
EXPECTATIONS LAID OUT ON DAY

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:23.805

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:36.377
COLLEGE THAT SHOULD BE THE

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:38.246
METRIC. THE METRIC SHOULD BE

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:43.151
PEOPLE WHO ARE. AT OR BELOW

01:28:43.217 --> 01:28:45.019

PATHWAYS WELL IT'S TOUGH TO

01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:04.806
BILLING CODING IT'S NOT REALLY

01:29:04.872 --> 01:29:06.607

VISUAL IDEAS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE

01:29:56.591 --> 01:29:59.026
A BIT OF A DUPLICATION ALSO

01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:00.561

MODEL TO CALIBRATE IS USING-

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:23.004
BASICALLY ALLOWS A STUDENT TO-

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:25.172
START AND STOP AT ANYTIME

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:27.541

01:35:12.073 --> 01:35:14.275
NUMBERS AND THE AGES. IT'S

01:35:14.341 --> 01:35:16.310
QUITE A VARIETY OF AGES AND

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:18.245
QUITE A VARIETY OF ETHNIC

IT'S STILL MIGHT FIND THIS THAT

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:40.334
WORKS FOR THEM. SO AS WE MOVE

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:41.635
FORWARD I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:35:41.702 --> 01:35:43.604

01:35:58.285 --> 01:36:00.287
WE CAN'T LET. TRADITIONAL

01:36:00.354 --> 01:36:02.156
COLLEGE GET IN THE WAY OF

01:36:02.223 --> 01:36:04.358
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE NEW AND

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:06.360

AS STUDENTS THAT HARD TO REACH-

01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:15.636
AND THEN THERE WAS A QUESTION.

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:16.971
ABOUT WHY DON'T WE JUST DO THIS

01:36:17.037 --> 01:36:18.939

COURSES THAT ARE DONE VERY

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:13.794
DIFFERENTLY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:37:13.861 --> 01:37:15.996
TO SCALE THOSE COURSES AND VERY

01:37:16.063 --> 01:37:19.900
DIFFICULT- TO PROVIDE A

LISTENING TO THIS IS THAT. THIS

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.139
IS A MIGHTY POWERFUL

01:39:05.205 --> 01:39:07.708
CONDEMNATION OF OUR EXISTING.

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:09.476
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:11.378
THE SYSTEM IN THE INDIVIDUAL

01:39:11.445 --> 01:39:12.413
COLLEGES AND DISTRICTS THAT

01:39:12.479 --> 01:39:15.082

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:17.484
ENOUGH TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN

EMPLOYER COMMUNITY. SUCH THAT

01:39:21.689 --> 01:39:23.190
WE NEED TO CREATE A SEPARATE

STANDALONE INSTITUTION TO DO SO.

01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:29.363

BE CERTAIN FREE TO RESPOND TO

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:33.801
IT BUT- I THINK THAT'S A

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:35.602
CONCERN THAT MY COLLEAGUE

01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:37.771
REFERENCE TO TWENTY TWO

01:39:37.838 --> 01:39:38.372
THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:43.410
TO PROJECT. TO HAVE ENROLLED IN.

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:43.944
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY

01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:44.578
TWENTY SIX. QUESTION WHAT'S THE

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:48.415
PROJECTION BASED ON. I'M AFRAID

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:50.784
I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION-

01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:52.920
AT MY FINGER TIPS AND- BUT WE

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:54.588
CAN CERTAINLY GET THAT TO YOU

01:39:54.655 --> 01:39:55.823
WHAT DO YOU KNOW WAS THERE A

01:39:55.889 --> 01:39:58.325
SURVEY OF HIM AS THE ALL HAS TO

01:39:58.392 --> 01:40:00.194
QUESTIONS TOLD THEY'RE ALL IN

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.762
LOSS COULD ONLY ASK ONE BUT ALL

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:04.365
IS GOOD COMPOUND QUESTION WHAT

01:40:04.431 --> 01:40:08.369
IS A STATE WIDE MARKET FOR THIS.

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:09.937
AND HOW IT HOW WAS THAT STATE

01:40:10.003 --> 01:40:15.376
WIDE MARKET. FIGURE DETERMINED.

01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:17.311
WAS THERE A SURVEY OF EMPLOYERS

01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:19.947
CONDUCTED THAT PRODUCED THE

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:23.217
PROJECTION OF TWENTY TWO

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:23.817
THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED BECAUSE

01:40:23.884 --> 01:40:25.252
IT WAS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FOUR

01:40:25.319 --> 01:40:26.487
HUNDRED NOT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND

01:40:26.553 --> 01:40:29.156
AT NINETEEN THOUSAND AT TWENTY

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:30.457
FIVE THOUSAND. IT WAS A NUMBER.

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:33.694
SO I WILL NOT SPEAK TO THE

01:40:33.761 --> 01:40:34.628
TWENTY TWO THAT FOUR HUNDRED

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:36.130
BUT I WILL SPEAK TO THE

01:40:36.196 --> 01:40:37.664
EMPLOYER PART OF THIS HOW WE

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:39.933
DETERMINE THE MARKET WHEN WE

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.035
INITIALLY CAME BEFORE YOU OF A

01:40:42.102 --> 01:40:44.104
YEAR AND A HALF AGO THAT MARKET

01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:45.472
WAS DETERMINED THROUGH

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:49.076
NUMEROUS- EMPLOYER ENGAGEMENTS

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:50.544
UP AND OWN THE STATE I BELIEVE

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:53.447
THERE WERE LIKE TEN FORUMS WITH

01:40:53.514 --> 01:40:54.648
IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:57.284
STATE WITH DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS

01:40:57.351 --> 01:40:58.652
EVERYTHING FROM HEALTH CARE TO

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:00.487
ADVANCED MANUFACTURING-

01:41:00.554 --> 01:41:05.426
LOGISTICS. HEALTH CARE- WE ALSO

01:41:05.492 --> 01:41:08.662
HAD ENGAGEMENTS WITH LABOR

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:10.264
ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT

01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:12.566
MANY OF THOSE JOBS FOR EXAMPLE

01:41:12.633 --> 01:41:14.701
WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH. A

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:16.804
U. H. W. ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:18.806
ISSUES. TO LEARN WHAT THEIR

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:19.873
NEEDS ARE WE WORK WITH THE

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:22.609
JOINT TRAINING CENTERS- BETWEEN

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:24.878
EMPLOYERS AND LABOR. SO THAT

01:41:24.945 --> 01:41:29.917
INITIAL- AGE GROUP TWENTY FOUR

01:41:29.983 --> 01:41:30.584
THIRTY FIVE I BELIEVE IT WAS AN

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:32.686
AROUND TWO POINT FOUR TWO POINT

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:34.521
FIVE MILLION STUDENTS WAS HOW

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:37.524
WE GOT TO THAT NUMBER- THAT IS

01:41:37.591 --> 01:41:39.359
WHAT WE HEARD FROM EMPLOYERS.

01:41:39.426 --> 01:41:42.362
THAT THAT IS- DEMOGRAPHIC OF

01:41:42.429 --> 01:41:44.398
WORKERS THAT THEY FELT IS IN

OTHERS. THAT'S FOR THAT INITIAL

01:41:57.010 --> 01:42:00.180
NUMBER CAME FROM- I WOULD HAVE

THEN THEN THAT'S NOT WHAT IT

01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:29.249
WAS BUILT TO DO IT WAS BUILT TO

01:46:29.316 --> 01:46:30.817

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:32.753
FORMER WHICH IS TO CREATE

01:46:32.819 --> 01:46:35.355

LISTED AS A PROGRAM. IS

01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:43.063
SPECIFICALLY IN THE

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:45.165
CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE HAD

01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:46.099
WITH THE UNITED HEALTHCARE

THAT'S WHERE THAT PROGRAM

01:46:51.905 --> 01:46:53.540
PATHWAY CAME FROM AND IT WAS

01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:56.076
INTRODUCED IN THIS ROOM IN

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:57.444

ASKED. WHAT PROGRAM WOULD YOU

01:47:00.247 --> 01:47:03.250
BEGIN ITH AND WHY AND SO- THIS

01:47:03.316 --> 01:47:05.685
IS EITHER THE SAME WORKERS THAT

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:07.087

01:47:24.871 --> 01:47:27.207
NEVER GOING TO BE ORGANIZED-

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:31.211
OPERATE FACULTY WILL- SO. THIS

01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:33.013

OF THE DAY THAT WE ARE THINKING

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:42.856
ABOUT THIS PROBLEM- A AND I

01:47:42.923 --> 01:47:45.959

01:47:55.902 --> 01:47:57.437
THAT THIS IS MY JUSTIFIED AND

01:47:57.504 --> 01:48:02.509
PERHAPS ISN'T. DEPENDING ON THE

01:48:02.576 --> 01:48:05.545

TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD

01:48:26.199 --> 01:48:28.902
THIS CANNOT BE A TERMINAL

01:48:28.969 --> 01:48:31.071
CREDENTIAL IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:32.606
OUR HOPE IS THAT THESE

01:48:32.672 --> 01:48:33.940
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT

EMPLOYERS WHICH SHOULD BE MY

01:59:02.468 --> 01:59:04.770
INSTINCT AND DIRECTION. IF I

01:59:04.837 --> 01:59:06.405
CAN AT SENATOR THAT IS

01:59:06.472 --> 01:59:08.140
SOMETHING WE DO NOW AS A MATTER

01:59:08.207 --> 01:59:10.409
OF FACT- CAL THE FOUNDATION FOR

01:59:10.476 --> 01:59:11.777

COLLEGES- HAS AN ARRANGEMENT

01:59:15.515 --> 01:59:17.016
WITH MANY OF OUR COMPLETE

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:18.518

01:59:23.923 --> 01:59:26.459
THE X. EMPLOYERS SOME HAVE OVER

THE COST. OF KNOWING THIS TO

OPERATE IN THIS AN. SO I THINK

01:59:38.905 --> 01:59:39.805
IT SOMETHING THAT CAL BREAKING

01:59:39.872 --> 01:59:40.673

FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

01:59:58.224 --> 02:00:01.460
COLLEGES IT ALLOWS THEM TO BE

02:00:01.527 --> 02:00:03.029

02:00:03.095 --> 02:00:05.231
COMPENSATION FOR THOSE STUDENT

02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:07.667

JOBS THAT THEY DIDN'T OTHERWISE

02:00:08.868 --> 02:00:11.504

02:00:11.571 --> 02:00:13.472
WE CURRENTLY USE IN THOSE IN

02:00:13.539 --> 02:00:15.808

OPTIONS THAT WERE CONSIDERED.

02:03:31.604 --> 02:03:33.005
CREATE THE ONLINE PROGRAM ON A

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:35.040
STATEWIDE BASIS WITHIN AN

02:03:35.107 --> 02:03:36.208
EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE ONE

02:03:36.275 --> 02:03:38.477
OF THEM. TO CREATE THE PROGRAM

02:03:38.544 --> 02:03:40.379
IS A CONSORTIUM OF COMMUNITY

02:03:40.446 --> 02:03:42.681
COLLEGES PRESUMABLY THOSE THAT

02:03:42.748 --> 02:03:43.682
WERE ACTIVE IN THE ONLINE

02:03:43.749 --> 02:03:48.020
EDUCATION. ARENA HOSTED BY ONE.

02:03:48.087 --> 02:03:49.054
THREE THE ONE THAT WAS SELECTED

CREATE A NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:03:50.623 --> 02:03:53.192

ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE.

02:03:58.297 --> 02:04:00.032
AND OF COURSE NUMBER THREE WAS

02:04:00.099 --> 02:04:02.668
SELECTED BUT WHY. WHY WAS THE

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:07.606
DECISION MADE. TO NOT USE THE

02:04:07.673 --> 02:04:09.141
CONSORTIUM APPROACH WHICH WAS

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:12.611
OPTION TWO. OR TO CREATE THE

CONTINUE TO DIRECTED INCREASED

02:04:21.387 --> 02:04:25.157
RATE TO THAT WE I EFFORTS. SO

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:27.960
THERE WERE SEVERAL REASONS-

02:04:28.027 --> 02:04:31.197
AND- THERE WAS A LOT OF

UNDER FOR HEALTHY ANSWERED ME

02:05:23.415 --> 02:05:24.383
BECAUSE DISTRICT AND THE

CHANCES OFFICE WE HAVE THE SAME

02:05:26.085 --> 02:05:27.653
PROBLEM WITH THE NEW ONLINE.

02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:29.521
OPERATION WE HAD TO ESTABLISH A

02:05:29.588 --> 02:05:31.123
GOVERNANCE MODEL WE HAVE HAD TO

02:05:31.190 --> 02:05:33.292
GO TO YES A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY

02:05:33.359 --> 02:05:35.494
COLLEGE DISTRICT SOUTH ORANGE

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:36.095
COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:05:36.161 --> 02:05:38.597
DISTRICT TO. TO ACQUIRE THE

02:05:38.664 --> 02:05:41.934
INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO PAYROLL TO

HAVE POLICIES- IN A VARIETY OF

02:05:44.303 --> 02:05:45.704
OTHER THINGS RIGHT ACTUALLY NO

02:05:45.771 --> 02:05:46.839
THE SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY

02:05:46.906 --> 02:05:48.007
COMMITTEE COLLEGES DOES NOT

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:50.910
PROVIDE ANY OF THAT- THE WHEN

02:05:50.976 --> 02:05:52.478
CAL BRIGHT WITH ESTABLISHA

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:54.680
UTILIZED THE FOUNDATION FOR THE

02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:56.682
CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES.

SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY

02:06:00.719 --> 02:06:02.121
COLLEGE SO THE REASON OUR

02:06:02.187 --> 02:06:03.889
POLICIES FROM SOUTHERN COUNTY

02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:06.859
RIGHT THE REASON THAT- IN

02:06:06.926 --> 02:06:09.061
STATUTE WE WERE REQUIRED IF YOU

02:06:09.128 --> 02:06:11.263
READ THE STATURE REQUIRES A

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:13.766
CHANCE OR TWO TABLETS ANIMAL

02:06:13.832 --> 02:06:15.034
YOU. LOCAL DISTRICT. THE

02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:19.505
RELEASE FOR THAT WAS TO ENSURE

02:06:19.571 --> 02:06:20.105
THAT THERE IS A LOCAL DISTRICT

02:06:20.172 --> 02:06:21.807
HAS LISTING BURKE UNIT SINCE

02:06:21.874 --> 02:06:30.449
THAT. AND WHEN. UBER. HERE'S

02:06:30.516 --> 02:06:32.084
FOR. CLASS STAFF BEFORE THEY

02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:35.321
THEM OR- ALLOWS THEM AT THIS TO

02:06:35.387 --> 02:06:37.690
A EXISTING. UNIT AS WELL AS PER.

02:06:37.756 --> 02:06:39.458
A NEW. AVENUE TO BEGIN TO WORK.

02:06:39.525 --> 02:06:41.727
WITH THE COMMUNITY DISTRICT- TO

02:06:41.794 --> 02:06:43.562
SHARE- INFORMATION- WHAT CAL

02:06:43.629 --> 02:06:45.164
BREDS DOING TO CREATE PROGRAMS

02:06:45.230 --> 02:06:48.367
ALIGNED DIRECTLY- SO THAT WAS

02:06:48.434 --> 02:06:51.403
THE INITIAL REASON WHY- IN

02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:54.373
STATUE WERE **** TO SET UP THAT

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.709
ARRANGEMENT AS WELL AS- THERE

02:06:56.775 --> 02:06:58.010
WAS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION

02:06:58.077 --> 02:06:59.345
IT WAS HAD AT THE TIME THE WAY

02:06:59.411 --> 02:07:01.046
THAT'S THE SAME. AS MY POINT

02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:02.614
ISN'T IT YOU HAVE WE HAVE TO DO

02:07:02.681 --> 02:07:04.149
THIS FOR THE ON LINE IF THERE

02:07:04.216 --> 02:07:05.451
WERE ADJUSTMENTS THAT NEED TO

02:07:05.517 --> 02:07:06.952
BE MADE IN THE ONLINE EDUCATION

02:07:07.019 --> 02:07:08.587
INITIATIVE. BUT THE ONLY

02:07:08.654 --> 02:07:10.155
EDUCATION INITIATIVE HAS NO

02:07:10.222 --> 02:07:12.324
EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN A CORE

02:07:12.391 --> 02:07:14.927
STAFF- THOSE EMPLOYEES THOSE

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:16.395
FACULTY OF THE FACULTY OF THE

02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:18.630
OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES HELP

02:07:18.697 --> 02:07:19.999
RIGHT DIDN'T EITHER UNTIL WE

02:07:20.065 --> 02:07:22.267
YES. RIGHT MY POINT THE OTHER

02:07:22.334 --> 02:07:23.769
POINT IN IS A VERY IMPORTANT

02:07:23.836 --> 02:07:26.839
POINT AND YOU KNOW- I CANNOT

02:07:26.905 --> 02:07:28.774
SPEAK FOR THE BERMAN

02:07:28.841 --> 02:07:29.908
ADMINISTRATION BUT THERE WAS A

02:07:29.975 --> 02:07:33.112
LOT OF NEGOTIATION. WITH MANY

02:07:33.178 --> 02:07:33.746
OF THE LABOR ORGANIZATION SINCE

02:07:33.812 --> 02:07:36.882
CAL AND IT'S INCORRECT HIGHER

02:07:36.949 --> 02:07:40.419
TO ENSURE THAT CAL I JUST LOOK

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:42.721
LIKE A CHARTER. UP ANOTHER

02:07:42.788 --> 02:07:45.257
DISTRICT. IN THE DIRECT DIRE

02:07:45.324 --> 02:07:47.059
ENSURE THAT THE CAL BRIGHT

02:07:47.126 --> 02:07:50.729
BOARD REPRESENTED STATEWIDE-

02:07:50.796 --> 02:07:51.997
INTERESTS AND THAT WAS

02:07:52.064 --> 02:07:53.232
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:54.433
ADMINISTRATION TO A

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:58.203
LEGISLATURE. THAT WAS A BIG

02:07:58.270 --> 02:08:01.240
DRIVER OF WHY WAS STATUS WE

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:03.675
QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW I COULD

02:08:03.742 --> 02:08:06.011
HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT A LOT OF

02:08:06.078 --> 02:08:07.446
OTHER. THINGS TO DO A LOT. FOR

02:08:07.513 --> 02:08:11.050
THAT. BUT IS A IT BUT TO SOME.

02:08:11.116 --> 02:08:13.585
GOVERNOR BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF

02:08:13.652 --> 02:08:28.934
BEING CONCERNED. THAT. LOOK.

02:08:29.001 --> 02:08:32.738
PREVAILING ISSUES AS TO WHY WAS

02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:34.606
ESTABLISHES WAY WHAT GIVEN THE

02:08:34.673 --> 02:08:35.974
FACT THEY WERE ALMOST TWO YEARS

02:08:36.041 --> 02:08:38.544
DOWNSTREAM IN GIVEN ALL THAT

02:08:38.610 --> 02:08:40.612
HAS HAPPENED- WOULD YOU MAKE

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:42.281
THE SAME DECISION OR MAKE THE

02:08:42.347 --> 02:08:44.149
SAME RECOMMENDATION TODAY IN

02:08:44.216 --> 02:08:46.251
TERMS OF THE STRUCTURE. OUR I

02:08:46.318 --> 02:08:48.520
WOULD. AGREE AS OPPOSED TO

02:08:48.587 --> 02:08:51.123
OPTION ONE TWO OR FOUR I THINK.

02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:52.091
I THINK WE PICKED THE RIGHT

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:53.759
OPTION IF I WAS TO DO THIS

02:08:53.826 --> 02:08:54.960
DIFFERENTLY I THINK THERE WOULD

02:08:55.027 --> 02:08:56.862
BE MORE CLARITY AND WHAT THAT

02:08:56.929 --> 02:08:57.996
OPTION LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT THE

02:08:58.063 --> 02:08:59.465
EXPECTATIONS ARE AND HOW THEY

02:08:59.531 --> 02:09:01.166
SHOULD BE ORGANIZED AND IS

02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:04.169
THERE A TIME LINE- TO GO TO

02:09:04.236 --> 02:09:06.538
SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT- IT'S

02:09:06.605 --> 02:09:11.643
VERY DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HOW

02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:13.345
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN. DONE AND

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:15.547
HOW YOU SELECTED DISTRICT- HOW

02:09:15.614 --> 02:09:18.951
DO YOU MANAGE TO COMPETING-

02:09:19.017 --> 02:09:20.352
BARGAINING UNIT AGREEMENTS THAT

02:09:20.419 --> 02:09:22.955
WOULD NEED TO BE CREATED- HI

02:09:23.021 --> 02:09:24.556
YOU DEVELOP. THE

02:09:24.623 --> 02:09:26.291
INFRASTRUCTURES QUICKLY IS A

02:09:26.358 --> 02:09:28.427
HAVE- I MEAN ONE IMPORTANT

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:31.997
ELEMENT HERE IS FOR EXAMPLE. OF

02:09:32.064 --> 02:09:33.599
ALMOST ALL OF OUR COLLEGES ARE

02:09:33.665 --> 02:09:35.434
UNDER THE LEARNING MANAGEMENT

02:09:35.501 --> 02:09:38.303
SYSTEM CALLED CANVAS. IN CANVAS

02:09:38.370 --> 02:09:39.838
IS A STATE WIDE THAT YOU

02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:42.207
LEGISLATURE OF CALIBRATE COULD

02:09:42.274 --> 02:09:44.543
NOT. ALTHOUGH THEY TRIED HAS

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:46.078
NOT BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE UNDER

02:09:46.145 --> 02:09:47.412
THE CAL CAMPUS MODEL BECAUSE

02:09:47.479 --> 02:09:50.482
CANVASES NOT PROVIDE- THE TOOLS

02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:52.184
NECESSARY TO DELIVER COUNTY

02:09:52.251 --> 02:09:53.585
BASED EDUCATION FOR THIS ALLOWS

02:09:53.652 --> 02:09:54.653
CALIBRATE WHAT'S THAT MEAN

02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:55.854
BECAUSE IS A LEARNING

02:09:55.921 --> 02:09:57.456
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM UP LATER I

02:09:57.523 --> 02:09:58.290
KNOW THE LEARNING MANAGEMENT

02:09:58.357 --> 02:10:00.659
SYSTEM. IS WHAT THE BASICALLY

02:10:00.726 --> 02:10:02.261
THE SHELL THE STUDENTS OPERATE

02:10:02.327 --> 02:10:04.730
IN. TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTION AND

02:10:04.796 --> 02:10:07.232
INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR COURSES

02:10:07.299 --> 02:10:11.570
SO WE HAVE GENERALLY- 98% OF

02:10:11.637 --> 02:10:13.071
OUR COLLEGES OPERATE UNDER ONE

02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:14.139
LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

02:10:14.206 --> 02:10:17.409
CALLED CAN THAT THE COMPANY-

02:10:17.476 --> 02:10:20.379
AND SO THAT WAS A GREAT A GREAT

02:10:20.445 --> 02:10:23.248
ACHIEVEMENT- FOR COMPANY BASED

02:10:23.315 --> 02:10:27.686
EDUCATION- WHO. STUDENTS HAVE

02:10:27.753 --> 02:10:28.854
TO OPERATE IN A DIFFERENT

02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:30.622
ENVIRONMENT ONE THAT IS OPEN

02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:32.224
ACCESS ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A

02:10:32.291 --> 02:10:33.292
TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC CALENDAR

02:10:33.358 --> 02:10:35.194
CAMPUS COULD NOT AT THAT TIME

02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:37.863
PROVIDE CAL BRIGHT WITH THAT

02:10:37.930 --> 02:10:39.331
MODIFICATION BUT HAS COMMITTED

02:10:39.398 --> 02:10:40.732
TO TRY TO DO THAT FOR THIS

02:10:40.799 --> 02:10:42.201
STORM. SO THIS ALLOWS CAO

02:10:42.267 --> 02:10:44.102
BRIGHT TO WORK WITH OTHER

02:10:44.169 --> 02:10:45.837
LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

02:10:45.904 --> 02:10:47.206
HELP BETTER INFORM CANVAS OF

02:10:47.272 --> 02:10:48.540
THE CHANGES THAT ARE GONNA NEED

02:10:48.607 --> 02:10:49.474
TO BE MADE FOR GOING TO SCALE

02:10:49.541 --> 02:10:53.512
THIS- STATEWIDE SO THIS PUSH

02:10:53.579 --> 02:10:55.214
AND PULL IS AN IMPORTANT

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:57.182
ELEMENT OF WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

02:10:57.249 --> 02:10:58.417
FOR CAL BRIGHT TO BE OPERATING

02:10:58.483 --> 02:11:00.752
IN THIS WAY BECAUSE- NOW WE

02:11:00.819 --> 02:11:03.689
HAVE. FACT FACULTY AND STAFF

02:11:03.755 --> 02:11:06.158
SOLELY DEDICATED TO TRYING TO

02:11:06.225 --> 02:11:07.926
SOLVE THIS ISSUE AROUND HOW TO

02:11:07.993 --> 02:11:09.428
BEST DELIVER SCALABLE COMES

02:11:09.494 --> 02:11:12.965
BASED EDUCATION- SO I REALIZE.

02:11:13.031 --> 02:11:15.367
IT'S A COMPLICATED WEB OF

02:11:15.434 --> 02:11:17.236
DIFFERENT REASONS. BUT

02:11:17.302 --> 02:11:20.005
ULTIMATELY- AGAIN IF I WAS TO

02:11:20.072 --> 02:11:22.874
DO THIS OVER AGAIN- I THINK I

02:11:22.941 --> 02:11:25.010
WOULD ASK FOR MORE TIME FOR

02:11:25.077 --> 02:11:27.145
CALIBRATE TO ESTABLISH ITSELF.

02:11:27.212 --> 02:11:29.615
MORE TIME FOR IT TO. DEVELOP

02:11:29.681 --> 02:11:33.218
PROGRAMS- AND MORE TIME TO

02:11:33.285 --> 02:11:35.120
DETERMINE ITS WAY FOR

02:11:35.187 --> 02:11:35.921
ACCREDITATION BECAUSE I DON'T

02:11:35.988 --> 02:11:38.924
THINK RIGHT NOW- ACC JC THE

02:11:38.991 --> 02:11:40.058
REGIONAL CREDITOR FOR

02:11:40.125 --> 02:11:42.094
CALIFORNIA IS RIGHT A CREDITOR

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:43.962
FOR CALIBRATED- BUT THAT WAS

02:11:44.029 --> 02:11:45.731
THE DESIRE OF THE LEGISLATURE

02:11:45.797 --> 02:11:47.899
AT THE TIME. SO THAT WAS. WHAT

02:11:47.966 --> 02:11:49.268
WE RESPONDED TO WELL UNDER THE

02:11:49.334 --> 02:11:51.370
STANDARD YOU DON'T EVEN QUALIFY

02:11:51.436 --> 02:11:53.238
FOR ACCREDITATION UNDER THAT.

02:11:53.305 --> 02:11:54.873
NOT UNLESS CAL RIGHT DEVELOP AN

02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:58.443
ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE AND OTHER

02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:59.411
THAN ALWAYS A POINT OF DEBATE.

02:11:59.478 --> 02:12:03.348
YES AT LEAST ONE. NOW ACC JC IS

02:12:03.415 --> 02:12:05.617
LOOKING AT CHANGING SOME OF ITS

02:12:05.684 --> 02:12:06.752
STANDARDS AND WE WILL WORK WITH

02:12:06.818 --> 02:12:08.420
THEM. AS IT AGAINST YOUR CREDIT

02:12:08.487 --> 02:12:12.024
MORE MORE CBA CB INSTITUTIONS-

02:12:12.090 --> 02:12:13.859
BUT THAT'S IT'S AN ISSUE FOR

02:12:13.925 --> 02:12:15.661
ANOTHER DAY FOR NOW THERE IS AN

02:12:15.727 --> 02:12:17.729
ACCREDITING. A COMMITTEE. THAT

02:12:17.796 --> 02:12:20.499
COULD CREDIT RIGHT SHOWING I

02:12:20.565 --> 02:12:22.067
THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE- SO IT

02:12:22.134 --> 02:12:22.968
THE LEAD I HAVE ONE OTHER

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:28.774
QUESTION FINAL. ONE IS GOING TO

02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:33.011
BE FINE IF. YOUR THING IN. ONE

02:12:33.078 --> 02:12:35.447
YES WE BE IF THIS LAW. IN

02:12:35.514 --> 02:12:36.581
CONJUNCTION WITH THE A MINISTRY

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:38.750
DECIDED TO PIVOT AWAY FROM THE

02:12:38.817 --> 02:12:42.554
CURRENT MODEL. OPTION THREE TO

02:12:42.621 --> 02:12:44.523
A CONSORTIUM OF COMMUNITY

02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:47.459
COLLEGES HEAVILY INVOLVED IN

02:12:47.526 --> 02:12:50.028
ONLINE EDUCATION WITH THE

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:51.663
INSTRUCTION AND OF COURSE THE

02:12:51.730 --> 02:12:53.965
FUNDING THAT GOES ALONG WITH

02:12:54.032 --> 02:12:57.636
THAT TO. INSURE THAT THE ONLINE

02:13:05.577 --> 02:13:06.111
PORTION OF THEM AT LEAST THREE

02:13:06.178 --> 02:13:11.450
OF THEM. THAT THE OFFERINGS BE

MARKETED. STATE WIDE THROUGH

02:13:14.486 --> 02:13:16.288
VARIOUS ONLINE PLATFORMS THAT

EITHER ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO

OWN INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS OR ARE

02:13:23.028 --> 02:13:25.397
DEVELOPED AGAIN WITH FUNDING.

02:13:25.464 --> 02:13:27.766
WHAT DIFFICULTY WITH THAT. IN

02:13:27.833 --> 02:13:30.168
TALE FOR THE SYSTEM AT THIS

02:13:30.235 --> 02:13:36.842
POINT. WELL. AGAIN YOU KNOW- I

02:13:36.908 --> 02:13:38.477
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE MODEL

02:13:38.543 --> 02:13:40.379
CHOSEN WHAT'S THE BEST GIVEN

02:13:40.445 --> 02:13:42.547
THE CHOICES AVAILABLE CERTAINLY

02:13:42.614 --> 02:13:43.915
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE

02:13:43.982 --> 02:13:44.683
ADMINISTRATION S. CHANCES

02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:46.351
OFFICE TO BUT WE WILL DO

02:13:46.418 --> 02:13:47.753
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE

02:13:47.819 --> 02:13:49.154
THAT IT'S SUCCESSFUL THE

02:13:49.221 --> 02:13:51.056
CHALLENGE WITH THE MODEL IS

02:13:51.123 --> 02:13:54.426
THAT- DISTRICTS ARE GOVERNED

02:13:54.493 --> 02:13:57.496
LOCALLY- THEY HAVE COMPETING

02:13:57.562 --> 02:14:01.066
INTERESTS- AND THEY HAVE A

02:14:01.133 --> 02:14:02.300
MYRIAD OF MISSIONS THAT THEY'RE

02:14:02.367 --> 02:14:06.037
ALREADY TRYING TO FULFILL- THAT

02:14:06.104 --> 02:14:07.906
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY CAN'T DO

02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:09.474
IT I BELIEVE IT WOULD JUST TAKE

02:14:09.541 --> 02:14:11.710
MUCH MORE TIME. TO BUILD THE

02:14:11.777 --> 02:14:13.478
CAPACITY NECESSARY TO SERVE AT

02:14:13.545 --> 02:14:15.347
SCALE THE WORKERS THAT WERE

02:14:15.414 --> 02:14:19.618
TALKING ABOUT- AND SO IT'S ALSO

02:14:19.684 --> 02:14:21.653
VERY DIFFICULT- YOU DETERMINE

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:23.622
WHO ARE WHO ARE THE DISTRICTS

02:14:23.688 --> 02:14:25.590
BEST POSITION TO DO THIS

02:14:25.657 --> 02:14:27.125
BECAUSE WE HAVE MANY DISTRICT

02:14:27.192 --> 02:14:29.027
THEY'RE DOING PARTS OF THIS I

02:14:29.094 --> 02:14:30.695
DO BELIEVE THAT IS SIMPLE FOR

02:14:30.762 --> 02:14:33.298
COPYRIGHT TWO IS BUSH FOR LACK

02:14:33.365 --> 02:14:34.966
OF A BETTER TERM AN INNOVATION

02:14:35.033 --> 02:14:36.968
ALLIANCE WITH CALLED THAT YOU

02:14:37.035 --> 02:14:41.072
JUST DESCRIBED. TO SHARE IN THE-

02:14:41.139 --> 02:14:42.808
CREATION OF THE CONTENT IN THE

02:14:42.874 --> 02:14:44.543
DIRECTION OF CAL BRIGHT AND I

02:14:44.609 --> 02:14:45.477
BELIEVE THAT THAT IS STILL

02:14:45.544 --> 02:14:48.146
POSSIBLE- AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE

02:14:48.213 --> 02:14:49.981
CALIBRATE TO FORM THAT. KIND OF

02:14:50.048 --> 02:14:51.450
INNOVATION ALLIANCE WITH

02:14:51.516 --> 02:14:52.384
COLLEGES AND I BELIEVE THAT

02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:54.453
THERE ARE COLLEGES TODAY THAT

02:14:54.519 --> 02:14:56.188
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THAT.

02:14:56.254 --> 02:14:57.656
ONE FINAL QUESTION I'M SURE

02:14:57.722 --> 02:15:00.525
YOU'RE TIRED OF ME. THE

02:15:00.592 --> 02:15:01.827
IMPLEMENTING A BE FOR THIS

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:04.629
WHOLE PROCESS- RECORD THE

NINETEEN TO RECOMMEND TO THE

02:15:10.435 --> 02:15:12.137
BOARD OF GOVERNORS. WAYS OF

MAKING ONLINE AND COMPETENCY

02:15:14.139 --> 02:15:15.607
BASED PROGRAMS EASIER AND MORE

02:15:15.674 --> 02:15:17.609
ATTRACTIVE FOR COMMUNITY

02:15:17.676 --> 02:15:19.344
COLLEGES TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE

02:15:19.411 --> 02:15:21.947
INCLUDING WAYS TO STREAMLINE

02:15:22.013 --> 02:15:23.648
THE PROCESS SEES FOR ONE.

02:15:23.715 --> 02:15:25.183
FUNDING NONCREDIT COMPETENCY

02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:27.185

ON LINE COURSES UNDER A

02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:31.056
FLEXIBLE CALENDAR THE VERY

02:15:31.122 --> 02:15:32.791
THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING

02:15:32.858 --> 02:15:35.126
ABOUT. THAT GO TO THE CORE OF

02:15:35.193 --> 02:15:37.162
CALIBRATE AND THE VERY ISSUES

02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:39.097
THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO

02:15:39.164 --> 02:15:40.899
DISTINGUISH CALIBRATE FROM.

02:15:40.966 --> 02:15:43.969
COMMUNITY COLLEGES I ASSUME

02:15:44.035 --> 02:15:46.371
THAT YOUR OFFICE DID THAT AND

02:15:46.438 --> 02:15:49.007
CONTINUES TO DO THAT- WE ARE

02:15:49.074 --> 02:15:51.476
HAVE WE HAVE A VERY DELIBERATE

02:15:51.543 --> 02:15:53.011
TO PROCESS IN THE CALIFORNIA

02:15:53.078 --> 02:15:54.513
COMMITTEE COLLEGES WE ARE

02:15:54.579 --> 02:15:56.448
WORKING WITH OUR STATEWIDE

02:15:56.515 --> 02:15:58.049
ACADEMIC SENATE THROUGH THE

02:15:58.116 --> 02:15:59.684
COMMITTEES THAT ARE.

02:15:59.751 --> 02:16:01.052
APPROPRIATE TO THIS ISSUE TO

02:16:01.119 --> 02:16:03.355
DEVELOP TITLE FIVE REGULATIONS

02:16:03.421 --> 02:16:05.624
THAT WOULD ALLOW. ALL OF OUR

02:16:05.690 --> 02:16:07.726
COLLEGES AWAY TO OFFER COUNTY

02:16:07.792 --> 02:16:09.761
BASED EDUCATION TO CONSIDER THE

02:16:09.828 --> 02:16:10.795
CHALLENGES TO THE CURRENT

02:16:10.862 --> 02:16:12.397
CALENDAR TO CONSIDER MANY OF

02:16:12.464 --> 02:16:14.165
THE OTHER CHALLENGES SO THAT IS

02:16:14.232 --> 02:16:16.201
HAPPENING NOW. AND WE FEEL

02:16:16.268 --> 02:16:17.903
CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL WORKING

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:19.204
WITH THE STATEWIDE ACADEMICS

02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:20.705
AND BE ABLE TO DELIVER A SET OF

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:21.907
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF

02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:23.708
GOVERNORS AND THIS GOES TO AN

02:16:23.775 --> 02:16:25.844
EARLIER POINT I MADE AND SORT

02:16:25.911 --> 02:16:28.079
OF MY- CONFUSION ONE AND

02:16:28.146 --> 02:16:29.581
CONCERNED AND WE DON'T LOOK

02:16:29.648 --> 02:16:32.450
ORGANIZED. IT AND THIS IS SORT

02:16:32.517 --> 02:16:34.085
OF A RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT

02:16:34.152 --> 02:16:36.187
I'LL LET YOU RESPOND TO IF

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:37.322
THERE IS A QUESTION SOMEWHERE

02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:39.224
IN THERE BUT IF COMMUNITY

02:16:39.291 --> 02:16:41.159
COLLEGE DISTRICTS OR OR IN FACT

02:16:41.226 --> 02:16:43.228
ABLE TO OFFER NON CREDIT

02:16:43.295 --> 02:16:44.629
COMPETENCY BASED. PROGRAMS AND

02:16:44.696 --> 02:16:46.698
THEY DO START OF FLEXIBLE THIS

02:16:46.765 --> 02:16:48.867
OPEN ACCESS WITHOUT TERMS THAT

02:16:48.934 --> 02:16:52.137
ARE. BEGINNING AND AN END. THEN

02:16:52.203 --> 02:16:55.340
WHY PARALLEL TRACK THIS PROCESS

02:16:55.407 --> 02:16:58.843
AS WITH BROUGHT. TO DO EXACTLY

02:16:58.910 --> 02:17:00.979
THE SAME THING. SO CENTER I

02:17:01.046 --> 02:17:02.514
THINK THAT THAT IS A FAIR

02:17:02.581 --> 02:17:04.482
QUESTION AND A CRITICAL

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:07.552
QUESTION. IN A QUESTION WE

02:17:07.619 --> 02:17:10.121
DON'T REALLY SPEND A LOT OF

02:17:10.188 --> 02:17:13.024
TIME TALKING ABOUT- BECAUSE ON

02:17:13.091 --> 02:17:14.426
ONE HAND AS YOU MENTIONED

02:17:14.492 --> 02:17:15.961
EARLIER IT'S ALMOST COMES

02:17:16.027 --> 02:17:17.596
ACROSS AS A CONDEMNATION OF THE

02:17:17.662 --> 02:17:21.399
CURRENT SYSTEM AND I CERTAINLY

02:17:21.466 --> 02:17:23.268
DON'T WANT MY COMMENTS COME

02:17:23.335 --> 02:17:25.337
ACROSS AS A CONDEMNATION. MY

02:17:25.403 --> 02:17:28.340
COMMENTS ARE. YOU KNOW FOR

02:17:28.406 --> 02:17:31.242
EXAMPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:33.812
DE UM. STATES IN A

02:17:33.878 --> 02:17:34.980
COMMUNICATIVE TRICK HAS SEVERAL

02:17:35.046 --> 02:17:36.848
COLLEGES TO DO WONDERFUL WORK

02:17:36.915 --> 02:17:39.718
TO TRY AND SERVE THE NEEDS OF

02:17:39.784 --> 02:17:42.020
THE GREATER FRESNO AREA. BUT

02:17:42.087 --> 02:17:42.854
THEY ARE LOOKING TO ADD ONE

02:17:42.921 --> 02:17:45.624
MORE COLLEGE THE REASON IS NOT

02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:48.093
BECAUSE THE OTHER COLLEGES.

02:17:48.159 --> 02:17:50.695
CAN'T SERVE STUDENTS WHO MADERA

02:17:50.762 --> 02:17:52.430
IS BECAUSE THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS

02:17:52.497 --> 02:17:54.132
IN MADERA THAT WOULD BE BEST

02:17:54.199 --> 02:17:55.600
SERVED BY A COLLEGE SOLELY

02:17:55.667 --> 02:17:57.669
FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS OF THAT

02:17:57.736 --> 02:18:00.005
COMMUNITY. AND SO THIS IS A

02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:01.940
MECHANIS THAT WE'VE USED TO

02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:03.208
GROW INTO THE CAPACITY THAT WE

02:18:03.274 --> 02:18:06.077
HAVE. AND SO I THINK IT'S

02:18:06.144 --> 02:18:08.913
IMPORTANT THAT WHILE WE CAN

02:18:08.980 --> 02:18:11.916
ARGUE AS TO WHY WE BELIEVE THAT

02:18:11.983 --> 02:18:14.319
THESE THIS GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS

02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:15.553
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:16.988
AN BE ANSWERED BY A CURRENT

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:20.425
CAPACITY- I THINK. THAT HAVE

02:18:20.492 --> 02:18:22.394
BEEN A GROUP OF FACULTY AND

02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:24.696
STAFF SOLELY DEDICATED. TO

02:18:24.763 --> 02:18:27.399
SERVICING THEM NOT AS A BY

02:18:27.465 --> 02:18:30.568
PRODUCT OR IS A SUB MISSION OF

02:18:30.635 --> 02:18:31.836
ANOTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT

02:18:31.903 --> 02:18:33.138
THE SOLE MISSION OF COMMUNITY

02:18:33.204 --> 02:18:35.607
COLLEGE AND THEN BE ABLE TO

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:37.676
OFFER. ON RAMPS TO OTHER

02:18:37.742 --> 02:18:38.877
COMMITTEE CALLS ACROSS THE

02:18:38.943 --> 02:18:40.578
STATE I THINK IS THE BETTER

02:18:40.645 --> 02:18:42.480
ANSWER BECAUSE I WILL ONLY

02:18:42.547 --> 02:18:44.516
SPEAK FROM MY EXPERIENCE OF

02:18:44.582 --> 02:18:45.083
LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE MY

02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:47.018
PREVIOUS COLLEGE- WE HAVE A

02:18:47.085 --> 02:18:49.320
VERY HAD. THEY STILL HAVE A

02:18:49.387 --> 02:18:51.389
VERY ROBUST. NON CREDIT

02:18:51.456 --> 02:18:53.425
PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY IN

02:18:53.491 --> 02:18:54.025
ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE

02:18:54.092 --> 02:18:56.394
THEY TRAINED. THOUSANDS OF

02:18:56.461 --> 02:18:57.662
REFUGEES PARTICULAR FROM

02:18:57.729 --> 02:19:00.131
CAMBODIA AND FROM VIETNAM THAT

02:19:00.198 --> 02:19:02.133
CAME OVER AFTER THE VIETNAM WAR

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:04.636
THEY DID AN AMAZING JOB. THAT

02:19:04.703 --> 02:19:07.906
IS A LOCAL MEET. WHAT WE'RE

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:08.907
TALKING ABOUT NOW FOR

02:19:08.973 --> 02:19:11.576
CALIBRATED SO SKILLED STATEWIDE

02:19:11.643 --> 02:19:13.545
NEED IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING

02:19:13.611 --> 02:19:15.980
ENVIRONMENT. EVEN IF WE SCRATCH

02:19:16.047 --> 02:19:17.248
THE SURFACE OF THE NUMBER THAT

02:19:17.315 --> 02:19:18.316
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO AND A

02:19:18.383 --> 02:19:19.718
HALF MILLION A MILLION WHATEVER

02:19:19.784 --> 02:19:21.853
EVEN IF WE TOOK 2% OF THAT THAT

02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:23.555
IS STILL A HUGE INCREASE IN THE

02:19:23.621 --> 02:19:24.255
NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE

02:19:24.322 --> 02:19:26.224
WOULD NEED TO SERVE. A SO

02:19:26.291 --> 02:19:29.427
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT IS BEST

02:19:29.494 --> 02:19:30.829
TO CREATE AN ENTITY SOLELY

02:19:30.895 --> 02:19:32.831
FOCUSED ON THAT AND CAN BE

02:19:32.897 --> 02:19:34.032
CLEARLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE

02:19:34.099 --> 02:19:36.634
MEASURABLE OUTCOMES THAT WE

02:19:36.701 --> 02:19:38.403
EXPECT FROM IT WHEN YOU BURY IT

02:19:38.470 --> 02:19:39.704
FOR BLACK OF A BETTER TERM IN

02:19:39.771 --> 02:19:41.606
ANOTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE. CAN

02:19:41.673 --> 02:19:42.907
BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TEASE OUT

02:19:42.974 --> 02:19:49.114
OUTCOMES AT SPECIFIC CHARGE.

02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:50.048
ELEVEN ANY QUESTION FINAL

02:19:50.115 --> 02:19:51.750
QUESTIONS ARE CLOSING REMARKS

02:19:51.816 --> 02:19:52.951
BEFORE I CLOSE AT THE PANEL

02:19:53.017 --> 02:19:54.486
THANK YOU. FIRST I WOULD LIKE

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:56.955
TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT'S VERY

02:19:57.021 --> 02:19:58.623
FORWARD THINKING THAT WE ARE.

02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:00.725
WE NEED TO DO THIS AND SCALE IT

02:20:00.792 --> 02:20:02.827
STATE WIDE AND THAT WAS KIND OF

02:20:02.894 --> 02:20:04.162
GOES TO THE POINT I WAS TRYING

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:04.729
TO MAKE IT MAYBE DIDN'T DO A

02:20:04.796 --> 02:20:06.498
GOOD JOB OF IT. IS THAT WE NEED

02:20:06.564 --> 02:20:07.766
TO THINK DIFFERENTLY THE YOU

02:20:07.832 --> 02:20:08.900
KNOW THOSE OF US HER MAKING

02:20:08.967 --> 02:20:10.568
THESE DECISIONS. WE DIDN'T GO

02:20:10.635 --> 02:20:11.402
TO SCHOOL WE DIDN'T GO TO

RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE

02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:16.220

FACULTY ORGANIZE THEMSELVES IN

02:28:58.496 --> 02:29:01.932
THAT WAY. THE SECOND QUESTION

02:29:01.999 --> 02:29:03.334
YOU ASKED WITH TO PROVIDE AN

02:29:03.401 --> 02:29:05.202
OVERVIEW OF THE ONLINE

EDUCATION INITIATIVE IN THE

02:29:06.871 --> 02:29:08.773
WORK THE ACADEMIC SENATE HAS

02:29:08.839 --> 02:29:11.942
DONE WITH THAT- WE OFTEN WORK

02:29:12.009 --> 02:29:12.943
WITH THE- III IN A STATE MY

02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:15.046
CAPACITY TO COLLABORATIVELY

APPROVAL. MUCH OF THE INITIAL

02:29:19.016 --> 02:29:21.686
IDEAS OF WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS

02:29:21.752 --> 02:29:23.721
FOR OFFERING ONLINE EDUCATION

02:29:23.788 --> 02:29:25.323
WERE DONE COLLABORATIVELY. THE

02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:26.357
ACADEMIC SENATE MADE

02:29:26.424 --> 02:29:28.125
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THAT THE

02:29:28.192 --> 02:29:30.561
WE AYE- EXT TOOK ALL OF THOSE

02:29:30.628 --> 02:29:32.596
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CREATED THE

02:29:32.663 --> 02:29:35.132
STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS TODAY IN

02:29:35.199 --> 02:29:38.769
THE WAY I. WE ALSO TALK ABOUT-

02:29:38.836 --> 02:29:40.304
LOCALLY SUPPORTING THE

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:41.706
CURRICULAR DESIGN THE

02:29:41.772 --> 02:29:42.540
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

02:29:42.606 --> 02:29:44.709
STANDARDS AND PARTICULARLY THAT

02:29:44.775 --> 02:29:46.577
DEVELOPMENT OF THE C. T. E.

02:29:46.644 --> 02:29:48.913
ONLINE PATHWAYS THAT WAS FUNDED

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:49.747
BY THE LEGISLATURE TWO YEARS

02:29:49.814 --> 02:29:52.416
AGO. UP FOR THAT THIRTY FIVE

02:29:52.483 --> 02:29:53.651
MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME

02:29:53.718 --> 02:29:54.685
FUNDING AND I'LL TALK ABOUT

02:29:54.752 --> 02:29:56.287
THAT A LITTLE MORE. I IN A

02:29:56.354 --> 02:30:01.025
SECOND. THE THIRD QUESTION.

02:30:01.092 --> 02:30:02.460
ASKED WAS TO DESCRIBE OUR

02:30:02.526 --> 02:30:03.794
QUESTIONS REGARDING LEFT

02:30:03.861 --> 02:30:06.430
LEGISLATIVE CLARIFICATION ON

02:30:06.497 --> 02:30:09.967
DUPLICATION AND ACCREDITATION.

02:30:10.034 --> 02:30:12.103
SO WE HAVE A WE HAVE WRITTEN

02:30:12.169 --> 02:30:14.572
YOU LETTERS WHICH IS WHAT WE

02:30:14.638 --> 02:30:15.172
HOW WE PREFER TO INTERACT WITH

02:30:15.239 --> 02:30:20.711
YOU. AND NOT THIS WAY. I'M

02:30:20.778 --> 02:30:23.180
TRYING TO CLARIFY- SOME OF OUR

02:30:23.247 --> 02:30:24.982
CONCERNS YOU REFERENCED EARLIER

02:30:25.049 --> 02:30:27.585
THE AUGUST REPORT- FROM

02:30:27.651 --> 02:30:29.320
CALIBRATE TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:30:29.387 --> 02:30:32.356
WHERE THEY FIRST- TALKED ABOUT

02:30:32.423 --> 02:30:34.725
HAVING DEGREES AND THAT

02:30:34.792 --> 02:30:37.561
PROMPTED OUR FIRST LETTER IS

02:30:37.628 --> 02:30:39.930
THAT WAS PREFACED ON THE

02:30:39.997 --> 02:30:41.465
ASSUMPTION THAT THEY NEEDED TO

02:30:41.532 --> 02:30:44.235
ACHIEVE- TO EIGHT. THE TASTY

02:30:44.301 --> 02:30:46.704
SEE THROUGH THE ACCREDITOR. MY

02:30:46.771 --> 02:30:48.706
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY HAVE

02:30:48.773 --> 02:30:51.008
CHOSEN TO PURSUE A DIFFERENT A

02:30:51.075 --> 02:30:52.943
NATIONAL ACCREDITOR WHERE A

02:30:53.010 --> 02:30:55.079
DEGREE IT'S NOT REQUIRED- SO

02:30:55.146 --> 02:30:56.480
SOME OF THAT HAS BEEN

02:30:56.547 --> 02:30:58.682
ALLEVIATED BUT THERE IS LACK OF

02:30:58.749 --> 02:31:00.584
CLARITY IN THE LAW ABOUT WHAT

02:31:00.651 --> 02:31:03.421
THE LEGISLATOR X. BACK DID IN

02:31:03.487 --> 02:31:05.656
TERMS OF ACCREDITATION- BEYOND

02:31:05.723 --> 02:31:07.792
JUST BEING ACCREDITED AND THERE

02:31:07.858 --> 02:31:09.160
IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN.

02:31:09.226 --> 02:31:11.162
NATIONAL ACCREDITATION AND

02:31:11.228 --> 02:31:12.897
REGIONAL ACCREDITATION. THE

02:31:12.963 --> 02:31:15.499
SECOND TENT FOR ANY- ISSUE RE

02:31:15.566 --> 02:31:18.002
IS REGARDING- THE DUPLICATION

02:31:18.068 --> 02:31:21.071
OF PROGRAMS- AND WE HAVE

02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:22.673
OUTLINED OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE

02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:25.810
DUPLICATION OF PROGRAMS- AND

02:31:25.876 --> 02:31:32.650
PROVIDED EXAMPLES. AT. IT'S A

02:31:32.716 --> 02:31:35.519
LITTLE CONCERNING THAT- THE

02:31:35.586 --> 02:31:36.787
EDUCATION CODE LOOKED REALLY

02:31:36.854 --> 02:31:39.990
CLEAR. TO MOST OF THE FACULTY

02:31:40.057 --> 02:31:42.059
IN THE ACADEMIC SENATE ABOUT

02:31:42.126 --> 02:31:43.894
WHAT DUPLICATION OF PROGRAMS

02:31:43.961 --> 02:31:46.464
MEANT AND THE EXPLANATION

02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:49.200
PROVIDED BY CALIBRATE BY THEY

02:31:49.266 --> 02:31:52.503
ARE NOT DUPLICATING. WOULD BE

02:31:52.570 --> 02:31:53.103
TRUE FOR ANYTHING THEY WANTED

02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:57.942
TO DO. BY USING THAT STANDARD

02:31:58.008 --> 02:31:59.477
THERE IS A STANDARD IN TITLE

02:31:59.543 --> 02:32:02.112
FIVE- IN THIS SECTION OF THE

02:32:02.179 --> 02:32:03.714
REGULATION THAT GOVERNS

02:32:03.781 --> 02:32:06.116
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT IS

02:32:06.183 --> 02:32:06.617
APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF

02:32:06.684 --> 02:32:09.019
GOVERNORS THAT DEFINES A

02:32:09.086 --> 02:32:15.693
PROGRAM. AS A AS AS BEING

02:32:15.759 --> 02:32:19.096
DEFINED BY THE OUTCOMES OF THE

02:32:19.163 --> 02:32:21.198
OF THE COURSES AND CONTENT. IT

02:32:21.265 --> 02:32:22.600
DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

02:32:22.666 --> 02:32:24.168
WHETHER IT'S ONLINE OR FACE TO

02:32:24.235 --> 02:32:26.203
FACE WHETHER IT IS NON CREDIT

02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:28.005
OR CREDIT OR ANYTHING ELSE

02:32:28.072 --> 02:32:29.507
ABOUT WHAT THE PROGRAM IS AND

02:32:29.573 --> 02:32:30.975
THAT IS THE DEFINITION THAT THE

02:32:31.041 --> 02:32:32.576
REST OF THE SYSTEM HOUSE TO

02:32:32.643 --> 02:32:35.546
USE. IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS AND

02:32:35.613 --> 02:32:38.015
SO WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE

02:32:38.082 --> 02:32:39.884
SOME CLARITY IF THIS IS A

02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:41.919
DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF

02:32:41.986 --> 02:32:44.788
DUPLICATING A PROGRAM- I AM AND

02:32:44.855 --> 02:32:47.124
WHERE THAT LINE IS BECAUSE WE

02:32:47.191 --> 02:32:48.959
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE

02:32:49.026 --> 02:32:51.829
ASTOR TATIAN. THE ASSERTION OF

02:32:51.896 --> 02:32:55.733
CALIBRATE AROUND DUPLICATION. I

02:32:55.799 --> 02:32:58.636
DID WANT TO TALK TO YOU- A

02:32:58.702 --> 02:32:59.970
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE

02:33:00.037 --> 02:33:02.706
COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION. A

02:33:02.773 --> 02:33:06.510
PIECE OF THAT ARE BECAUSE WE-

02:33:06.577 --> 02:33:08.112
OFFER COMPETENCY BASED

02:33:08.178 --> 02:33:10.481
EDUCATION THAT IS THAT IS THE

02:33:10.548 --> 02:33:12.716
BASIS OF NON CREDIT NON CREDIT

02:33:12.783 --> 02:33:15.052
IS DESIGNED IN STATUTE THAT IT

02:33:15.119 --> 02:33:16.787
CAN BE A OPEN ENTRY AND OPEN

02:33:16.854 --> 02:33:21.525
EXIT. THAT IT CAN BE- EITHER

02:33:21.592 --> 02:33:23.060
TRANSCRIPT DOUBLE OR NOT YOU

02:33:23.127 --> 02:33:24.562
DON'T HAVE TO TRANSCRIPT IT IT

02:33:24.628 --> 02:33:26.163
DEPENDS ON WHAT THE STUDENT

02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:28.999
WANTS OUT FROM THAT AND WE

02:33:29.066 --> 02:33:32.236
OFFER NON CREDIT PROGRAMS

02:33:32.303 --> 02:33:34.338
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. NOT AS

02:33:34.405 --> 02:33:36.640
MANY OF THEM ARE ONLINE AND

02:33:36.707 --> 02:33:38.642
THERE ARE REASONS FOR THAT THAT

02:33:38.709 --> 02:33:40.744
ARE STRUCTURAL TO THE SYSTEM WE

02:33:40.811 --> 02:33:42.446
APPRECIATE THE REPORT THAT THE

02:33:42.513 --> 02:33:44.315
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I RECENTLY

02:33:44.381 --> 02:33:45.883
SENT TO YOU ABOUT COMPETENCY

02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:47.618
BASED EDUCATION. BECAUSE IT

02:33:47.685 --> 02:33:50.754
HIGHLIGHTS. HOW IN THE

02:33:50.821 --> 02:33:53.057
CONSTRUCTION OF OUR SYSTEM WE

02:33:53.123 --> 02:33:55.392
AS WE OF DISINCENTIVE IZED.

02:33:55.459 --> 02:33:57.828
THAT WE HAVE MADE THAT LESS

02:33:57.895 --> 02:33:59.997
APPEALING IN TERMS OF HOW WE

02:34:00.064 --> 02:34:03.200
FIND THE COLLEGES- AND THAT IS

02:34:03.267 --> 02:34:03.701
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

02:34:03.767 --> 02:34:07.972
CONSIDER. I DID WANT TO SAY.

02:34:08.038 --> 02:34:12.810
ALSO THAT. THAT THE LAST

02:34:12.876 --> 02:34:14.478
QUESTION WAS HOW CAN THE STATE

02:34:14.545 --> 02:34:15.879
BETTER SUPPORT FACULTY IN

02:34:15.946 --> 02:34:17.381
COLLEGE AS AN OFFERING ONLINE

02:34:17.448 --> 02:34:19.950
EDUCATION AND I HAVE A FEW

02:34:20.017 --> 02:34:23.120
RECOMMENDATIONS. THE FIRST IS

02:34:23.187 --> 02:34:25.556
THE- ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS

02:34:25.623 --> 02:34:26.724
THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:28.792
AND THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT

02:34:28.859 --> 02:34:29.860
YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE

02:34:29.927 --> 02:34:33.564
ONLINE- EDUCATION AN ISSUE TO

02:34:33.631 --> 02:34:35.366
THE COURSE EXCHANGE AND CROSS

02:34:35.432 --> 02:34:39.370
ENROLLMENT. RIGHT NOW- IS BEING

02:34:39.436 --> 02:34:43.207
EXPANDED- THROUGHOUT A COLLEGES

02:34:43.273 --> 02:34:45.009
TO TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

02:34:45.075 --> 02:34:47.444
STUDENTS TO ACCESS THAT. YOUR

02:34:47.511 --> 02:34:48.779
CORRECT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE

02:34:48.846 --> 02:34:51.148
FIFTY SEVEN- COLLEGES IN THE

02:34:51.215 --> 02:34:53.083
CONSORTIUM- I THINK THAT NUMBER

02:34:53.150 --> 02:34:55.786
IS. MOVING TO SEVENTY BY THE

02:34:55.853 --> 02:35:00.257
END OF THE YEAR. THAT'S AND%

02:35:00.324 --> 02:35:02.626
THAT THAT HAS BEEN A

02:35:02.693 --> 02:35:04.728
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THAT IS

02:35:04.795 --> 02:35:07.131
HAVE INPUT FROM MANY

02:35:07.197 --> 02:35:08.866
STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW TO SERVE

02:35:08.932 --> 02:35:11.068
STUDENTS BOTH REGIONALLY AND AS

02:35:11.135 --> 02:35:14.038
A STATE. I DID WANT TO SAY THAT

02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:15.673
MOVING AWAY FROM OUR CURRENT

02:35:15.739 --> 02:35:16.840
FUNDING STRUCTURE WHICH IS

02:35:16.907 --> 02:35:20.577
BASED ON WEEKLY STUDENT CONTACT

02:35:20.644 --> 02:35:22.246
AROUND WHAT THE CALENDAR HAS TO

02:35:22.312 --> 02:35:25.315
LOOK LIKE. CURRENTLY ADVANTAGE

02:35:25.382 --> 02:35:27.785
IN FUNDING THE FACE TO FACE

02:35:27.851 --> 02:35:31.422
COURSE THAT IS A FULL SEMESTER-

02:35:31.488 --> 02:35:35.059
FOR CREDIT. WE ARE ABLE TO

02:35:35.125 --> 02:35:37.227
OFFER DIFFERENT WAYS OF

02:35:37.294 --> 02:35:39.063
INSTRUCTION THAT WOULD MEET THE

02:35:39.129 --> 02:35:40.831
DEMANDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

02:35:40.898 --> 02:35:44.601
CLEARLY IDENTIFIED NEED TO BE-

02:35:44.668 --> 02:35:47.037
PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIA. TO DO

02:35:47.104 --> 02:35:50.174
THAT BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:52.710
EXAMINE THAT FUNDING. STRUCTURE

02:35:52.776 --> 02:35:56.380
TO DO THAT. AND THE LAST THING.

02:35:56.447 --> 02:35:57.948
I WILL CLOSE WITH I KNOW YOU

02:35:58.015 --> 02:35:59.583
WERE ASKED ME TO SPEAK FOR

02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:01.185
THREE MINUTES AND I HAVE LIKE

02:36:01.251 --> 02:36:01.719
FIVE HUNDRED OTHER THINGS

WRITTEN DOWN HERE SO I WOULD BE

02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:06.123

IS AVAILABLE- THROUGH THE

02:36:10.661 --> 02:36:12.162
CONSORTIUM YOU JUST HAVE TO

02:58:52.388 --> 02:58:54.824
KEY TO ACTUALLY DOING THIS DATA

02:58:54.890 --> 02:58:57.259
IS HAVING THAT GRANULAR LEVEL

02:58:57.326 --> 02:58:58.594
ALSO SECURITY NUMBER AS A

02:58:58.661 --> 02:59:00.863
PERSONAL IDENTIFIER THAT LINKS

ALL TO THREE FORMS OF ANALYSIS

02:59:06.902 --> 02:59:09.071
THAT I LAID OUT. IN WE COULD DO

02:59:09.138 --> 02:59:10.639
THAT IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL

PERFORM THE JOB MARKET ANALYSIS

02:59:15.945 --> 02:59:17.213
PER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THESE

02:59:17.279 --> 02:59:20.149
THREE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE

02:59:20.216 --> 02:59:20.683
TALKING ABOUT HERE WAS CAL

02:59:20.749 --> 02:59:21.884
RIGHT. I THINK WE ARE WE DOING

02:59:21.951 --> 02:59:23.586
IT TODAY. THEY THEYWE'VE DONE

02:59:23.652 --> 02:59:25.454
THIS ANALYSIS THAT YOU HAVE IN

HANDOUT HERE- ALL THIS KIND OF

02:59:28.390 --> 02:59:30.392
DATA WE WERE ASKED TO DO THIS-

02:59:30.459 --> 02:59:31.861
ANALYSIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA

02:59:31.927 --> 02:59:34.530
WORK FOR SPORT. BUT I HAVE NO

02:59:34.597 --> 02:59:35.865
INDIVIDUAL KNOWLEDGE OF

02:59:35.931 --> 02:59:37.700
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE EDT

02:59:37.766 --> 02:59:39.869
AND CAL BRIGHT COLLEGE WELL

02:59:39.935 --> 02:59:40.603
THEN MY OTHER QUOTE I'VE

02:59:40.669 --> 02:59:42.404
ACTUALLY I'VE GOT A COUPLE BUT

02:59:42.471 --> 02:59:44.206
THIS ANALYSIS IS STATEWIDE DO

02:59:44.273 --> 02:59:45.774
YOU DO YOUR DOES YOUR SYSTEM

02:59:45.841 --> 02:59:47.776

BREAK THIS DOWN BY REGION YEAH

02:59:49.678 --> 02:59:50.846
WE ACTUALLY BREAK IT DOWN BY

02:59:50.913 --> 02:59:52.648
METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA

02:59:52.715 --> 02:59:54.316
WHICH IS A COMBINATION OF

02:59:54.383 --> 02:59:55.985
VARIOUS COUNTIES SO THERE BE A

02:59:56.051 --> 02:59:58.621
SACRAMENTO MSA ALSO WE HAVE THE

02:59:58.687 --> 03:00:00.389
METROPOLITAN DIVISION AREAS. IN

03:00:00.456 --> 03:00:02.124
THESE ARE ALL FEDERAL STANDARDS

03:00:02.191 --> 03:00:04.326
FOR- BREAKING DOWN INFORMATION

03:00:04.393 --> 03:00:06.128
ON A REGIONAL LEVEL. BECAUSE

03:00:06.195 --> 03:00:06.662
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:00:06.729 --> 03:00:08.731
EDUCATION AND CERTIFICATES AND

03:00:08.797 --> 03:00:11.367
EMPLOYABILITY. IT'S ONE THING

IF THE JOB IS IN THE BAY AREA.

03:00:24.113 --> 03:00:24.680
AND THEY HAVE A FAMILY MAKES IT

03:00:24.747 --> 03:00:26.048
A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

03:00:26.115 --> 03:00:28.350
FILL THE JOB SO SOME TO AT SOME

03:00:28.417 --> 03:00:29.518
POINT THIS WHOLE PROCESS NEEDS

03:00:29.585 --> 03:00:31.420
TO BE. REGIONALIZED WHICH

03:00:31.487 --> 03:00:34.156
PROBABLY SPEAKS TO. WHAT LOCAL

03:03:03.272 --> 03:03:05.674
IT'S- ONLY LOCALIZA CERTAIN

03:03:05.741 --> 03:03:08.777
PARTS OF LA AND ULTIMATELY HOW

03:03:08.844 --> 03:03:13.315
TO UTILIZE A. SAMPLES I CAN

03:03:13.382 --> 03:03:14.783
PROVIDE BUT I FOR THE SAKE OF

03:03:14.850 --> 03:03:17.453
TIME LIMITED THAT- WE CURRENTLY

03:03:17.519 --> 03:03:18.687
DON'T HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH

03:03:18.754 --> 03:03:20.456
CALIBRATE WE'RE HERE TODAY IN

03:03:20.522 --> 03:03:21.357
SUPPORT THE PROGRAM AS IT WAS

03:03:21.423 --> 03:03:22.825
ENVISIONED- THE OPPORTUNITY WE

03:03:22.891 --> 03:03:23.992
SEE IN COBB RIGHT IN THE

03:03:24.059 --> 03:03:24.993
SUPPORT WE HAVE GIVEN TO THE

03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:26.462
CONCEPT. IS THAT IT IS A

03:03:26.528 --> 03:03:27.396
DIFFERENT STRUCTURE FROM THAT

03:03:27.463 --> 03:03:29.064
OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN

03:03:29.131 --> 03:03:30.165
AND WE KNOW THAT SOME COMMUTING

03:03:30.232 --> 03:03:31.734
COLLEGES ARE WE UNDERSTAND IF

03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:32.701
THEY OFFER THAT TRAINING AND

03:03:32.768 --> 03:03:34.937
CERTIFICATION- AND THAT THE

03:03:35.003 --> 03:03:36.205
YEAH I MIGHT HAVE A SIMILAR

03:03:36.271 --> 03:03:38.507
PROGRAM AS WELL BUT- OUR LOCALS

03:03:38.574 --> 03:03:39.208
OF EXPRESS THAT THEY NEED A

03:03:39.274 --> 03:03:40.542
MORE EXPENSIVE. A MORE

03:03:40.609 --> 03:03:42.144
ACCESSIBLE IN A TARGETED

03:03:42.211 --> 03:03:44.079
EDUCATION PATHWAY BY SUPPORTING

03:03:44.146 --> 03:03:45.481
HOW BRIGHT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

03:03:45.547 --> 03:03:46.782
DIMINISH THE TRADITIONAL

03:03:46.849 --> 03:03:47.950
COLLEGE STRUCTURE OR THE- WE I

03:03:48.016 --> 03:03:49.852
PROGRAM. WE SUPPORT STUDENTS

03:03:49.918 --> 03:03:50.519
ARE PRACTICALLY EVERY

03:03:50.586 --> 03:03:52.321
TRADITIONAL COLLEGE AND- III

03:03:52.388 --> 03:03:53.122
BUT THERE CONTINUES TO BE

03:03:53.188 --> 03:03:54.890
WORKERS LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE NOT

03:03:54.957 --> 03:03:56.058
ENOUGH PROGRAMS MEET WORKERS

03:03:56.125 --> 03:03:57.426
WHERE THEY ARE AND THAT

03:03:57.493 --> 03:03:58.861
INCLUDES THAT WE AYE PROGRAM.

03:03:58.927 --> 03:03:59.928
AND WILL KNOW IT SINCE THE

03:03:59.995 --> 03:04:01.530
CONVERSATION AROUND COPY AND-

03:04:01.597 --> 03:04:04.166
YEAH I AS VASTLY IMPROVED WE

03:04:04.233 --> 03:04:04.600
DON'T THINK THAT'S A

03:04:04.666 --> 03:04:06.435
COINCIDENCE- MANY OF OUR LOCALS

03:04:06.502 --> 03:04:07.669
HAVE EXPRESSED ABOUT. ARIENS AN

03:04:07.736 --> 03:04:08.637
EXPANSION OF PROGRAMS

03:04:08.704 --> 03:04:10.172
THROUGHOUT THE YEAH I AND WE DO

03:04:10.239 --> 03:04:11.240
APPLAUD THOSE EFFORTS

03:04:11.306 --> 03:04:12.841
ENCOURAGING AND HOPE FOR

03:04:12.908 --> 03:04:14.710
CONTINUED INVESTMENTS- BUT

03:04:14.777 --> 03:04:16.178
ULTIMATELY WHAT OUR LOCAL HAVE

03:04:16.245 --> 03:04:17.346
INDICATED THAT THEY'VE EXPAND

03:04:17.413 --> 03:04:19.314
THE USE OF YEAH I IS STILL FOR

03:04:19.381 --> 03:04:20.616
PRE REQUISITES AND STILL FOR

03:04:20.682 --> 03:04:21.850
TRADITIONAL TWO AND FOUR YEAR

03:04:21.917 --> 03:04:24.219
DEGREES- SO AGAIN WE DON'T SEE

03:04:24.286 --> 03:04:25.187
EVEN IF THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF

03:04:25.254 --> 03:04:27.423
OVERLAP. THE TRACKS ARE USUALLY

03:04:27.489 --> 03:04:28.757
PRETTY DIFFERENT WITH THEIR

03:04:28.824 --> 03:04:30.292
LOOKS SEEKING HOW BRIGHT AND

03:04:30.359 --> 03:04:31.560
WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING IN THE ON

03:04:31.627 --> 03:04:33.595
THE BRICK AND MORTAR AND- WE I.

03:04:33.662 --> 03:04:35.664
DID THE CURRENT OF COMMITTEE

03:04:35.731 --> 03:04:36.865
CALLED INCIDENT ON BOTH IT

03:04:36.932 --> 03:04:38.167
DOESN'T ALLOW FOR A STREAMLINED

03:04:38.233 --> 03:04:40.636
APPROACH FOR PARTNERSHIP- NOT

03:04:40.702 --> 03:04:42.371
ONLY STATEWIDE BUT EVEN

03:04:42.438 --> 03:04:45.541
LOCALLY- FOR INSTANCE YOU AGE

03:04:45.607 --> 03:04:47.543
YOU WHICH IS JUST NUMBERS.

03:04:47.609 --> 03:04:52.014
BECAUSE AS I OVER HUNDRED AND

03:04:52.080 --> 03:04:57.085
TEN. TAX WHEN. CAN'T TURN HIGH.

03:04:57.152 --> 03:05:00.789
PROSTOCKS NEXT TO FORCE THE

03:05:00.856 --> 03:05:02.591
MAN'S DOES DUE TO TIME YOU

03:05:02.658 --> 03:05:03.859
WOULD WAS ON TO PARTNER WITH

03:05:03.926 --> 03:05:05.060
CAL RIGHT FOR THEM PROBE BUT WE

03:05:05.127 --> 03:05:05.694
ARE MOVING WITH THE DEATH

03:05:05.761 --> 03:05:06.328
TRAINING PROVIDER WHICH I KNOW

03:05:06.395 --> 03:05:08.697

03:05:08.764 --> 03:05:09.832
A PROGRAM RUNNING OFF GROUND WE

03:05:09.898 --> 03:05:11.967
WERE YU FINDS A CENTER WORKERS

03:05:12.034 --> 03:05:13.702
TO PRIVATE INTO FOR PROFIT SO

03:05:13.769 --> 03:05:16.104
WE THOUGHT- A NONPROFIT LARGER

03:05:16.171 --> 03:05:17.339
PROGRAMMING WAS STILL A BETTER

03:05:17.406 --> 03:05:19.374
ALTERNATIVE ULTIMATELY WE WOULD

03:05:19.441 --> 03:05:20.976
LIKE TO SEE A PUBLIC OPTION- WE

03:05:21.043 --> 03:05:21.810
KNOW THAT HOW BRIGHT HAS

03:05:21.877 --> 03:05:23.145
MEDICAL COOKING UP AND RUNNING

03:05:23.212 --> 03:05:24.179
AND IF WE COULD. COURTNEY

03:05:24.246 --> 03:05:25.113
EFFORTS I DON'T THINK WE WOULD

03:05:25.180 --> 03:05:28.550
ROLL OUT UTILIZING THEM. WE ARE

03:05:28.617 --> 03:05:30.319
SELLING GAUGING AT U. H. W.

03:05:30.385 --> 03:05:32.321
SPECIFICALLY- IS WORKING WITH

03:05:32.387 --> 03:05:33.355
THEM TO SEE IF THERE'S A BETTER

03:05:33.422 --> 03:05:35.624
PATHWAY TO MOVE FORWARD- YOU

03:05:35.691 --> 03:05:36.758
KNOW OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE

03:05:36.825 --> 03:05:37.693
ONGOING WE BELIEVE THAT

03:05:37.759 --> 03:05:38.927
COOPERATE IN THE CONCEPT BEHIND

03:05:38.994 --> 03:05:40.529
THEIR INSTITUTION IS A NEEDED

03:05:40.596 --> 03:05:42.631
ONE WITHIN OUR WORK FORCE- AND

03:05:42.698 --> 03:05:43.932
MY CLOSING DOES TIE BACK TO

03:05:43.999 --> 03:05:46.368
WAY. DR PAN RAISED AND WHAT THE

03:05:46.435 --> 03:05:48.504
ET SPOKE TO WHICH I FIND

03:05:48.570 --> 03:05:49.171
TROUBLING- AND HAS BEEN

03:05:49.238 --> 03:05:50.873
DIFFICULT FOR US IS THAT WHEN

03:05:50.939 --> 03:05:52.007
WE FIRST DISCUSSED HOW BRIGHT

03:05:52.074 --> 03:05:53.108
WE LOOKED AT EVERY SINGLE ONE

03:05:53.175 --> 03:05:54.343
OF OUR LOCAL THEM WHAT THEY

03:05:54.409 --> 03:05:55.644
NEEDED. AND WE PROBABLY

03:05:55.711 --> 03:05:56.945
REPRESENT LOW WAGE WORKERS THEY

03:05:57.012 --> 03:05:59.114
DO WHAT JOB THAT'S NEEDED- AND

03:05:59.181 --> 03:06:00.983
THEY ALSO DESERVE OPPORTUNITIES

03:06:01.049 --> 03:06:02.784
AND THEY DESERVE- TO FIND

03:06:02.851 --> 03:06:04.353
AFFORDABLE PUBLIC OPTION RATHER

03:06:04.419 --> 03:06:05.254
THAN HAVING TO TURN TO PRIVATE

03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:07.589
SECTOR- BUT THE SUCCESS METRIC

03:06:07.656 --> 03:06:08.924
METRICS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING.

03:06:08.991 --> 03:06:10.726
THEY LEAVE THEM OUT. SO WITH

03:06:10.792 --> 03:06:12.327
THE FOR INSTANCE THE CLASSIFIED

03:06:12.394 --> 03:06:13.662
WORKER AT THE WOULD RECEIVE A

03:06:13.729 --> 03:06:15.497
5% SALARY INCREASE THAT WOULD

03:06:15.564 --> 03:06:17.299
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. BECAUSE

03:06:17.366 --> 03:06:18.767
THEY ARE LIVING. ON THE CUSP OF

03:06:18.834 --> 03:06:21.370
POVERTY WAGES SO 5% WOULD BE A

03:06:21.436 --> 03:06:22.771
MORE STABLE HOME LIFE FOR THEIR

03:06:22.838 --> 03:06:25.040
FAMILY. IT ALSO WOULD BE IN

03:06:25.107 --> 03:06:25.707
HOUSE A LOT OF WORK FOR

03:06:25.774 --> 03:06:27.776
CONTRACTING OUT. SO YOU KNOW

03:06:27.843 --> 03:06:29.578
THAT'S JUST A GOOD INVESTMENT

03:06:29.645 --> 03:06:31.813
PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT ALSO IS A

03:06:31.880 --> 03:06:32.648
GOOD INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC AFTER

03:06:32.714 --> 03:06:35.250
WE WOULD IT HURRY NEARLY. SIX

03:06:35.317 --> 03:06:36.351
MONTHS YOU ALSO CA. IS THE

03:06:36.418 --> 03:06:37.586
EMPLOYER A GOOD EMPLOYER ARE

03:06:37.653 --> 03:06:39.288
THEY A PULP. EMPLOYER ARE THE

03:06:39.354 --> 03:06:40.489
EMPLOYEES REPRESENTED DO THEY

03:06:40.556 --> 03:06:42.791
HAVE BENEFITS. THERE'S A LOT OF

03:06:42.858 --> 03:06:44.326
FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE

03:06:44.393 --> 03:06:45.394
CONSIDERED- AND NOT JUST WE

03:06:45.460 --> 03:06:46.828
JUST ALONE ALTHOUGH WE DO THINK

03:06:46.895 --> 03:06:48.664
LEADERS ARE STRONG INDICATOR-

03:06:48.730 --> 03:06:50.699
SO WE URGE THAT THE GOAL SHOULD

03:06:50.766 --> 03:06:51.533
ACTUALLY BE FOR GOOD MIDDLE

03:06:51.600 --> 03:06:54.937
CLASS JOBS. WE ARE SUPPOSE BUT

03:06:55.003 --> 03:06:57.306
WE ARE SUPPORTED BE COLLEGES

03:06:57.372 --> 03:06:59.341
AND WERE SUPPORT ABOUT. BECAUSE

03:06:59.408 --> 03:07:04.580
WE REALLY THINK THAT USED TO BE.

03:07:04.646 --> 03:07:07.449
WORKERS AND MEETING. THEY ARE

03:07:07.516 --> 03:07:09.885
HOWEVER. IS MISINTERPRETED I

03:07:09.952 --> 03:07:11.753
THINK THERE IS TO MAKE SURE

03:07:11.820 --> 03:07:13.522
THAT WE MEET WORKERS WERE THERE.

03:07:13.589 --> 03:07:15.357
AT THE WE- SURE THAT WE GIVE

03:07:15.424 --> 03:07:24.166
WERE HEY UP. THEMSELVES BOTH

03:07:24.232 --> 03:07:25.167
FOR THEMSELVES IN THEIR AND

03:07:25.233 --> 03:07:25.767
WHAT WE NEED TO DO THINK SOME

03:07:25.834 --> 03:07:26.401
THE ISSUE. IS HOW WE STRUCTURE

03:07:26.468 --> 03:07:27.502
THIS. AND WHETHER WE SPEND

03:07:27.569 --> 03:07:28.804
TWELVE MONTHS. OUT WHO THE

03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:30.305
PRESIDENT IS AND HIRING THIRTY

03:07:30.372 --> 03:07:31.073
ONE ADMINISTRATORS OR WHETHER

03:07:31.139 --> 03:07:31.907
WE SPEND OUR TIME PUTTING

03:07:31.974 --> 03:07:33.275
COURSES ON THE GROUND AND

03:07:33.342 --> 03:07:35.310
LINING UP EMPLOYERS- I THINK

03:07:35.377 --> 03:07:36.845
THE IDENTITY OF THE EMPLOYERS.

03:07:36.912 --> 03:07:38.814
IS STILL AN ISSUE OBVIOUSLY WE

03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:40.515
KNOW WE'RE SCA USE INVOLVED IN

03:07:40.582 --> 03:07:42.084
SCA THOSE CONTRACTS YOU KNOW

03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:43.885
YOUR PLAYERS ARE. AND WE KNOW

03:07:43.952 --> 03:07:45.354
IF A LABOR ORGANIZATION CAN

03:07:45.420 --> 03:07:47.255
GATHER UP WORKERS WHO NEED.

03:07:47.322 --> 03:07:48.724
ADDITIONAL TRAINING OR UP

03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:50.359
SKILLING. AND CAN WORK WITH THE

03:07:50.425 --> 03:07:51.660
EMPLOYER THAT THEY WORK WITH ON

03:07:51.727 --> 03:07:53.195
A DAILY BASIS. THERE'S SOME

03:07:53.261 --> 03:07:55.097
CONNECTIVITY THERE WHAT I'M

03:07:55.163 --> 03:07:57.032
CONCERNED ABOUT IN ADDITION TO

03:07:57.099 --> 03:07:58.300
THE OTHER COMMENTS I MADE. IS

03:07:58.367 --> 03:08:00.302
THE LACK OF CONNECTIVITY WITH

03:08:00.369 --> 03:08:02.204
THOSE WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY

03:08:02.270 --> 03:08:04.740
SEIU. WHO DON'T HAVE EXISTING

03:08:04.806 --> 03:08:06.141
CONTRACTS BETWEEN LABOR

03:08:06.208 --> 03:08:07.409
ORGANIZATION AND THEIR

03:08:07.476 --> 03:08:09.444
EMPLOYER. CAN CONNECT THEM.

03:08:09.511 --> 03:08:11.847
WITH THE CERTIFICATE TO SOME

03:08:11.913 --> 03:08:14.650
NEW. A SKILLED JOB AND I THINK

03:08:14.716 --> 03:08:15.951
WE NEED WE NEED A LITTLE WORK

03:08:16.018 --> 03:08:18.253
ON THAT THE QUESTION IS DOES

03:08:18.320 --> 03:08:19.821
THE CURRENT STRUCTURE DO THAT.

03:08:19.888 --> 03:08:21.356
THEN THE PATH READING DOWN AS

03:08:21.423 --> 03:08:22.958
SHE THAT OR DO WE NEED TO PIVOT

03:08:23.025 --> 03:08:24.292

03:08:24.359 --> 03:08:25.494
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:26.695
MY POSITION ON ALL THIS IS

03:08:26.762 --> 03:08:28.163
CLEAR BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE

LIVABLE WAGE. AND IN LA COUNTY-

03:09:13.742 --> 03:09:15.177

MAKES THE CASE ON ITS OWN JUST

03:19:04.732 --> 03:19:06.701
BY READING THROUGH IT- AND

03:19:06.768 --> 03:19:07.969
WE'VE BEEN POSED TO CALIBRATE

03:19:08.036 --> 03:19:09.771
SINCE IT WAS FIRST DISCUSSED

03:19:09.837 --> 03:19:11.472
AND WE'VE BEEN VERY VERY

03:19:11.539 --> 03:19:13.474
VOCALLY OPPOSED. TO IT

03:19:13.541 --> 03:19:15.643
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS- I

03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:17.612
WANTED TO DISPEL A FEW MINUTES

03:19:17.679 --> 03:19:19.747
THAT WERE- MENTIONED EARLIER

03:19:19.814 --> 03:19:22.150
TODAY ON THE LEGISLATURE REALLY

03:19:22.216 --> 03:19:24.285
PER SUPPORTED CAL RIGHT EITHER

03:19:24.352 --> 03:19:25.953
WHEN IT WAS IN CONCEIVED

03:19:26.020 --> 03:19:30.224
LOBBIED FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND

03:19:30.291 --> 03:19:31.292
OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY

03:19:31.359 --> 03:19:32.894
LEGISLATORS WE WERE NEVER ABLE

03:19:32.960 --> 03:19:35.330
TO FIND ONE PERSON IN SUPPORT

03:19:35.396 --> 03:19:38.766
REASON IT CAME INTO BEING IS

03:19:38.833 --> 03:19:40.401
GOVERNOR BROWN. ALBRIGHT OUT

03:19:40.468 --> 03:19:41.269
AND SO PUT IT IN THE BUDGET

03:19:41.336 --> 03:19:41.903
BILL. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IT

03:19:41.969 --> 03:19:42.537
NOW IT WASN'T BECAUSE THEY WENT

03:19:42.603 --> 03:19:43.738
THROUGH REGULAR POLICY

03:19:43.805 --> 03:19:45.907
COMMITTEE HEARINGS LIKE. NORM

03:19:45.973 --> 03:19:47.642
NORMALLY BILLS WOULD AND IT'S

03:19:47.709 --> 03:19:49.077
MY GUESS HAD THAT BEEN THE CASE

03:19:49.143 --> 03:19:49.911
IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY DIED IN

03:19:49.977 --> 03:19:51.446
THE FIRST HEARING WHICH IS WHY

03:19:51.512 --> 03:19:53.181
I END UP IN THE BUDGET BILL. SO

03:19:53.247 --> 03:19:54.315
WE'RE STUCK WITH SOMETHING THE

03:19:54.382 --> 03:19:55.450
GOVERNOR BROWN REALLY WANTED

03:19:55.516 --> 03:19:57.051
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO

03:19:57.118 --> 03:19:57.819
SAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE REALLY

03:19:57.885 --> 03:19:59.620
WANTED IT OR EVER SUPPORTED AT

03:19:59.687 --> 03:20:01.956
ANY POINT IN TIME- I WANTED TO

03:20:02.023 --> 03:20:03.891
TALK ON. TOUCH ON THE ISSUE OF

03:20:03.958 --> 03:20:07.328
DUPLICATION. IT'S A BIG POINT A

03:20:07.395 --> 03:20:09.197
BONE OF CONTENTION AMONG US

03:20:09.263 --> 03:20:10.732
MOMENTS FACULTY OF THE SENATE

03:20:10.798 --> 03:20:13.868
AS WELL- THE STATUTES SUPER

03:20:13.935 --> 03:20:15.136
CLEAR. THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE

03:20:15.203 --> 03:20:16.070
DUPLICATING THE EXISTING

03:20:16.137 --> 03:20:18.506
PROGRAMS. WE DON'T THINK THAT

03:20:18.573 --> 03:20:19.841
THAT NEED A LOT OF EXTRA

03:20:19.907 --> 03:20:21.209
DEFINITION AS TO WHAT THAT

03:20:21.275 --> 03:20:22.877
REALLY MEANS AND- WHEN WE PRESS

03:20:22.944 --> 03:20:24.178
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ON THIS

03:20:24.245 --> 03:20:25.146
THE BEST WE CAN GET BACK FROM

03:20:25.213 --> 03:20:27.014
THEM WAS. WELL IT'S A TERM OF

03:20:27.081 --> 03:20:28.816
ART. WHAT IS THAT MEAN.

03:20:28.883 --> 03:20:29.884
DUPLICATION IT'S A PRETTY

03:20:29.951 --> 03:20:31.919
SIMPLE WORD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

03:20:31.986 --> 03:20:33.421
THAT MEANS IN. A TO GIVE YOU A

03:20:33.488 --> 03:20:35.089
SET THAT SIMILAR EXAMPLE WE

03:20:35.156 --> 03:20:37.458
HAVE A- MODEL BACCALAUREATE

03:20:37.525 --> 03:20:38.693
PROGRAM IN THE COMMUNITY

03:20:38.760 --> 03:20:41.629
COLLEGES AND PART OF THEIR-

03:20:41.696 --> 03:20:42.764
STATUTE OR THERE ARE.

03:20:42.830 --> 03:20:44.232
RESTRICTIONS THAT THEY CAN'T

03:20:44.298 --> 03:20:45.600
DUPLICATE ANY PROGRAMS AND SEE

03:20:45.666 --> 03:20:46.467
AS YOU ARE YOU SEE AND GUESS

03:20:46.534 --> 03:20:48.503
WHAT. NOT THEY'VE GOT THIRTEEN

03:20:48.569 --> 03:20:49.570
UNIQUE PROGRAMS AREN'T BEING

03:20:49.637 --> 03:20:51.572
RUN ANYWHERE ELSE. SO THESE

03:20:51.639 --> 03:20:53.207
THREE PROGRAM MEDICAL CODING.

03:20:53.274 --> 03:20:55.543
CYBERSECURITY AND FORMATION

03:20:55.610 --> 03:20:58.146
TECHNOLOGY. THERE ARE FIFTY ONE

03:20:58.212 --> 03:20:59.614
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT

03:20:59.680 --> 03:21:01.616
OFFER THOSE PROGRAMS. OF THE

03:21:01.682 --> 03:21:03.751
HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN ACCREDITED

03:21:03.818 --> 03:21:04.952
COMMUNITY COLLEGES FIFTY ONE.

03:21:05.019 --> 03:21:06.554
SO IT'S NOT JUST A LITTLE BIT

03:21:06.621 --> 03:21:07.922
OF DUPLICATION IT'S A LOT OF

03:21:07.989 --> 03:21:09.991
DUPLICATION AND THE REASON WHY

03:21:10.057 --> 03:21:11.359
THOSE FIFTY ONE COMMUNITY

03:21:11.426 --> 03:21:12.593
COLLEGES ARE OFFERING THOSE

03:21:12.660 --> 03:21:14.395
PROGRAMS. IS BECAUSE THEY'VE

03:21:14.462 --> 03:21:15.396
DONE THE RESEARCH THAT MR

03:21:15.463 --> 03:21:17.598

JOBS WE DON'T OFFER PROGRAMS IN

03:21:25.406 --> 03:21:26.140
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES IF

03:21:26.207 --> 03:21:28.209

03:21:28.276 --> 03:21:30.044
RIGHT WE DO THESE RESURGENT

03:21:30.111 --> 03:21:32.213

DO THIS RESEARCH LOCALLY WE

03:21:34.849 --> 03:21:36.484
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE JOB MARKET

03:21:36.551 --> 03:21:38.252
ARE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND

03:21:38.319 --> 03:21:39.253
WHAT PROGRAMS WE NEED TO PUT

03:21:39.320 --> 03:21:41.289
FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE STUDENT

03:21:41.355 --> 03:21:43.024
NEEDS WERE DOING THAT ON A

03:21:43.090 --> 03:21:44.025
REGULAR BASIS IT'S WHAT WE'RE

03:21:44.091 --> 03:21:45.893

03:21:48.663 --> 03:21:51.065
COMMUNITIES- THE OTHER POINT

03:21:51.132 --> 03:21:53.968
ABOUT. FOR PERHAPS THE STUDENTS

YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY'RE NOT

03:21:54.969 --> 03:21:56.938
ANYWHERE NEAR OF ONE OF THOSE

03:21:57.004 --> 03:21:57.672
FIFTY ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

03:21:57.738 --> 03:21:59.073
AND WANT TO TAKE THIS PROGRAM.

03:21:59.140 --> 03:22:00.608

STUDENT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

03:22:08.182 --> 03:22:09.684
THERE AREN'T GEOGRAPHICAL

03:22:09.750 --> 03:22:11.686
BOUNDARIES FOR ONLINE AT ANY

03:22:11.752 --> 03:22:13.187

MATTER WHERE THEY HAPPEN TO BE

03:22:15.890 --> 03:22:18.493
LOCATED. SO THERE'S NO BARRIER.

03:22:18.559 --> 03:22:20.361
AMONG THE CURRENT COMMUNITY

03:22:20.428 --> 03:22:22.430
COLLEGE SYSTEM. BASED ON

03:22:22.497 --> 03:22:23.764
GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF

03:22:23.831 --> 03:22:26.200
POTENTIAL STUDENTS THAT JUST

03:22:26.267 --> 03:22:29.203
DOESN'T EXIST. THE POINT WAS

03:22:29.270 --> 03:22:31.172
MADE ABOUT ACCREDITATION IF YOU

03:22:31.239 --> 03:22:33.140
RECALL SOME YEARS BACK WE HAD A

03:22:33.207 --> 03:22:34.375
BIG FIGHT AMONG IN THE

03:22:34.442 --> 03:22:36.177
COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH THE ACC

03:22:36.244 --> 03:22:38.613
JC. WHEN THERE ARE A CREDITOR

03:22:38.679 --> 03:22:40.381
BEFORE THERE WAS A CHANGE IN

03:22:40.448 --> 03:22:41.082
LEADERSHIP BECAUSE WE THOUGHT

03:22:41.148 --> 03:22:42.750
THEY WERE UNFAIRLY YOU KNOW

03:22:42.817 --> 03:22:43.718
SANCTIONING SOME OF OUR

03:22:43.784 --> 03:22:45.620
COLLEGES AT CETERA. AND NOW WE

03:22:45.686 --> 03:22:47.788
HEAR AND AT THE TIME THERE WAS

03:22:47.855 --> 03:22:48.856
A MOVEMENT TO MOVE TO A

03:22:48.923 --> 03:22:50.024
DIFFERENT A CREDITOR TO GET

03:22:50.091 --> 03:22:51.893
OUTSIDE OF THE CJC AND WE WERE

03:22:51.959 --> 03:22:53.728
TOLD NO ALL THE SYSTEM HAS TO

03:22:53.794 --> 03:22:55.863
BE IN WINE ACCREDITING BODY WE

03:22:55.930 --> 03:22:57.131
COULDN'T HAVE A DIFFERENT ONE

03:22:57.198 --> 03:22:58.666
OR TWO DIFFERENT CREDITORS. AND

03:22:58.733 --> 03:23:00.501
NOW HERE THE ONLINE COLLEGE

03:23:00.568 --> 03:23:01.402
THEY'RE GOING TO FIND ANOTHER

03:23:01.469 --> 03:23:02.703
WAY THEY'RE GONNA GET THEIR OWN

03:23:02.770 --> 03:23:04.372
A CREDITOR SO NOT ONLY DO THEY

03:23:04.438 --> 03:23:05.606
FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ABOVE THE LAW

03:23:05.673 --> 03:23:07.475
AND IN IN OTHER AREAS BUT NOW

03:23:07.542 --> 03:23:09.176
ITS ACCREDITATION AS WELL IF

THEY WEREN'T IN COMPLIANCE WITH

03:23:11.612 --> 03:23:13.748
A 50% LAW NO WE DON'T THINK

03:23:13.814 --> 03:23:14.315
THAT WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH

03:23:14.382 --> 03:23:15.216
THAT BUT NOW THEY DO HAVE TO

03:23:15.283 --> 03:23:17.051
COMPLY WITH THAT SO THROUGHOUT

03:23:17.118 --> 03:23:19.754
THIS PROCESS AS WELL AS THEM

03:23:19.820 --> 03:23:20.221
JUST. YOU KNOW BALLING

03:23:20.288 --> 03:23:21.989
DISREGARDING WHAT DISPATCH

WHERE THAT COMES FROM. OR NO

03:23:31.566 --> 03:23:34.201
WAY BUT THE BASIS IS ON THAT-

MORE MONEY INTO THAT. WE COULD

03:24:33.594 --> 03:24:35.029
GROW THAT AND MAKE THAT INTO A

03:24:35.096 --> 03:24:37.465
MUCH MORE ROBUST PRO PROGRAM.

03:24:37.531 --> 03:24:39.200
AND NO ONE MENTIONED THE ENGINE

03:24:39.266 --> 03:24:40.334
A LITTLE BIT THE NUMBERS BUT I

03:24:40.401 --> 03:24:41.936
JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THEM.

03:24:42.003 --> 03:24:43.471
THAT EVEN WITH THE NEW NUMBERS

03:24:43.537 --> 03:24:44.972
THAT WE WERE TOLD THIS MORNING

03:24:45.039 --> 03:24:46.307
THIRTY EIGHT STUDENTS ENROLLED

03:24:46.374 --> 03:24:48.576
IN THE- CAL BRIGHT COLLEGE. AND

03:24:48.643 --> 03:24:50.444
MAYBE A COUPLE HUNDRED IN THE

03:24:50.511 --> 03:24:51.612
PIPELINE TOWARDS ENROLLMENT

03:24:51.679 --> 03:24:54.281
THERE- KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE'RE

03:24:54.348 --> 03:24:55.549
IN THE REGULAR TRADITIONAL

03:24:55.616 --> 03:24:57.918
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. WE

03:24:57.985 --> 03:24:59.387
DON'T GET TO COUNT OR GET

03:24:59.453 --> 03:25:00.955
FUNDED FOR STUDENTS THAT DON'T

03:25:01.022 --> 03:25:02.623
ENROLL IN A CLASS SO FOR

03:25:02.690 --> 03:25:05.159
STUDENT TAKES A- KOREAN I'D

03:25:05.226 --> 03:25:07.561
TAKES A- PLACEMENT EXAM OR GOES

03:25:07.628 --> 03:25:09.497
TO AN ORIENTATION SESSION. OR

03:25:09.563 --> 03:25:10.831
MEET WITH A COUNSELOR AND THEN

03:25:10.898 --> 03:25:12.333
THEY DON'T ON ROLE WE DON'T GET

03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:13.768
ANY REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT WE

03:25:13.834 --> 03:25:14.368
DON'T GET ANY MONEY FOR THAT

03:25:14.435 --> 03:25:15.970
THE ONLY STUDENTS WE COUNT. ARE

03:25:16.037 --> 03:25:17.238
THE ONES AND ROLLED SO IF YOU

03:25:17.304 --> 03:25:18.673
COUNT THE ONES AND ROLLED AND

03:25:18.739 --> 03:25:20.875
CAL BRIGHT. THIRTY EIGHT. IT'S

03:25:20.941 --> 03:25:21.742
THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION

03:25:21.809 --> 03:25:23.511
DOLLARS PER PERSON WERE

03:25:23.577 --> 03:25:24.679
SPENDING FOR THOSE THIRTY EIGHT

03:25:24.745 --> 03:25:26.447
STUDENTS. AND AS YOU MENTIONED

03:25:26.514 --> 03:25:29.250
EARLIER CHAIR ROTH. WE HAVE A-

03:25:29.316 --> 03:25:30.785
YOU KNOW NOMENCLATURE OF FULL

03:25:30.851 --> 03:25:32.153
TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS WHICH

03:25:32.219 --> 03:25:33.087
IS HOW ARE FUNDING ACTUALLY

03:25:33.154 --> 03:25:35.589
ROLLS OUT. SO IF YOU CONVERT

03:25:35.656 --> 03:25:37.324
YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST ONE CLASS

03:25:37.391 --> 03:25:42.129
AT THEY'RE TAKING. ON AN FTL.

03:25:42.196 --> 03:25:44.398
IT'S A THIRTY SEVEN BILLION.

03:25:44.465 --> 03:25:48.836
PER FULL TIME. AND MONEY LET'S

03:25:48.903 --> 03:25:49.637
PULL ONE TIME MONEY OUT IT'S

03:25:49.704 --> 03:25:50.604
STILL FIVE THREE MAY. DOLLARS

03:25:50.671 --> 03:25:52.473
PER FTS THAT WE'RE SPENDING

03:25:52.540 --> 03:25:54.875
THERE. SO THE COLLEGES GET

03:25:54.942 --> 03:25:56.977
ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

03:25:57.044 --> 03:25:58.979
A THOUSAND TIMES LESS. PER FULL

03:25:59.046 --> 03:26:00.614
TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT IN THE

03:26:00.681 --> 03:26:02.216
CALPERS GETTING. SO IF YOU

03:26:02.283 --> 03:26:04.118
COULD JUST LIKE DOUBLE OUR

03:26:04.185 --> 03:26:06.253
RESOURCE WE WOULD BE IN GREAT

03:26:06.320 --> 03:26:08.989
SHAPE. RIGHT NOT WE ARE ASKING

03:26:09.056 --> 03:26:10.124
THAT YOU RAISE A BY A THOUSAND

03:26:10.191 --> 03:26:11.492
TIMES JUST DOUBLE THAT AND THEN

03:26:11.559 --> 03:26:12.660
WE'D BE IN GREAT SHAPE BECAUSE

03:26:12.727 --> 03:26:14.028
IF YOU COMPARE THE FUNDING FOR

03:26:14.095 --> 03:26:16.430
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO UC'S CSU.

03:26:16.497 --> 03:26:18.566
AND PRISONS WERE WAY AT THE

03:26:18.632 --> 03:26:20.000
BOTTOM EVERYONE GETS MORE

03:26:20.067 --> 03:26:22.069
FUNDING THAN WE DO PER PUPIL

03:26:22.136 --> 03:26:23.437
SO. THAT'S REALLY THE ROOT OF

03:26:23.504 --> 03:26:25.940
THIS PROBLEM. IT'S THE DRAMATIC

03:26:26.006 --> 03:26:27.575
UNDER FUNDING OUR DRASTIC

03:26:27.641 --> 03:26:28.642
UNDERFUNDING OF THE COMMUNITY

03:26:28.709 --> 03:26:30.177
COLLEGE SYSTEM IF THERE WAS

03:26:30.244 --> 03:26:31.812
MORE MONEY IN THE SYSTEM WE

03:26:31.879 --> 03:26:33.314
COULD EXPAND IN ALL OF THESE

03:26:33.380 --> 03:26:34.749
AREAS. AND JUST WITH THE

03:26:34.815 --> 03:26:36.250
LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE AND

03:26:36.317 --> 03:26:37.651
WE ARE YOU SEE ON THIS PAPER

03:26:37.718 --> 03:26:39.787
THAT IN THE PACKET. NINETY NINE

03:26:39.854 --> 03:26:40.387
THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE ALREADY

03:26:40.454 --> 03:26:41.555
BEEN SERVED THROUGH THAT

03:26:41.622 --> 03:26:43.157
PROGRAM AT A FRACTION OF THE

03:26:43.224 --> 03:26:44.525
COST. AND IF YOU READ THROUGH

03:26:44.592 --> 03:26:47.461
THE- OTHER OVERVIEW ON PAGE

03:26:47.528 --> 03:26:48.095
SEVENTEEN IT TALKS ABOUT

03:26:48.162 --> 03:26:49.630
BECAUSE I'M FROM SAN DIEGO SAN

03:26:49.697 --> 03:26:50.931
DIEGO CONTINUING THAT. WE'VE

03:26:50.998 --> 03:26:52.700
PUT TOGETHER PRETTY MUCH THE

03:26:52.767 --> 03:26:55.202
EXACT SAME PROGRAM. AS CAL

03:26:55.269 --> 03:26:57.104
BRIGHT FOR FRACTION OF THE COST

03:26:57.171 --> 03:26:59.106
THE SAME OPEN ENTRY OPEN EXIT

03:26:59.173 --> 03:27:00.975
IT'S FREE TO EVERYBODY. SAME

03:27:01.041 --> 03:27:04.779
TYPES OF DEGREES AND

03:27:04.845 --> 03:27:06.747
EVERYTHING CAL BRIGHT IS DOING.

03:27:06.814 --> 03:27:08.682
IN HOUSE AND AS WE SAID SINCE

03:27:08.749 --> 03:27:11.018
THE VERY FIRST MEETING ON THIS.

03:27:11.085 --> 03:27:13.154
THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE THE

03:27:13.220 --> 03:27:14.088
SEPARATE ENTITY IT'S NOT

03:27:14.155 --> 03:27:16.090
SERVING ANY PURPOSE THAT WE

03:27:16.157 --> 03:27:17.892
CAN'T ALREADY SERVE WITHIN THE

03:27:17.958 --> 03:27:20.294
EXISTING SYSTEM. SO WE THINK IT

03:27:20.361 --> 03:27:22.596
WOULD BE WISE. TO TAKE THESE

03:27:22.663 --> 03:27:25.232
RESOURCES AND REDEPLOY THEM IN

03:27:25.299 --> 03:27:28.769
SUCH A WAY. THAT WE GET. WE

03:27:28.836 --> 03:27:31.438
HAPPEN TO THE ALREADY A- MY

03:27:31.505 --> 03:27:33.774
MORE. SINCE IN THAT HAVE IN

03:27:33.841 --> 03:27:34.842
PLACE. THROUGH THE OTHER

03:27:34.909 --> 03:27:36.777
HUNDRED AND FOUR. AND COMMUNITY

03:27:36.844 --> 03:27:40.481
COLLEGE IN THIS. THANK YOU.

03:27:40.548 --> 03:27:42.016
THANK YOU I THINK IT GOES TO

03:27:42.082 --> 03:27:44.418
THE QUESTION SEVENTY ASK AT THE

03:27:44.485 --> 03:27:46.654
VERY BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS

03:27:46.720 --> 03:27:52.126
TO AND- TO DO IT WOULD. IT AND

03:27:52.193 --> 03:27:53.360
UNDERSERVED. BEEN OUT THERE IF

03:27:53.427 --> 03:27:54.728
THE RESEARCH POPULATION IN OUT

03:27:54.795 --> 03:27:57.097
STRUCTURE. BUT YOU CAN AND SET

03:27:57.164 --> 03:27:57.665
UP THIS OF OBJECTIVES AND

03:27:57.731 --> 03:27:59.300
METRIC SO WE CAN MEASURE

03:27:59.366 --> 03:28:01.468
SUCCESS IF THERE IS AN

03:28:01.535 --> 03:28:03.103
UNDERSERVED POPULATION AND YOU

03:28:03.170 --> 03:28:04.271
SPREAD THE MONEY OUT THEN THE

03:28:04.338 --> 03:28:06.106
QUESTION IS IMMEASURABLE AND

03:28:06.173 --> 03:28:07.474
CAN WE DETERMINE THE

03:28:07.541 --> 03:28:08.976
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE USE OF OUR

03:28:09.043 --> 03:28:10.678
FUNDS SO THERE'S SEVERAL

03:28:10.744 --> 03:28:13.547
DIFFERENT. QUESTIONS BUT ALL OF

03:28:13.614 --> 03:28:15.716
THEM FINAL BACK TO THE FIRST

03:28:15.783 --> 03:28:17.384
POINT WHICH IS THERE AN

03:28:17.451 --> 03:28:20.120
UNDERSTAND UNSERVED OF CADRE

03:28:20.187 --> 03:28:22.256
OF- POTENTIAL STUDENTS FOR

03:28:22.323 --> 03:28:24.158
STUDENTS OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT

03:28:24.225 --> 03:28:24.959
BEING SERVED BY THE CURRENT

03:28:25.025 --> 03:28:27.127
SYSTEM. CAN THIS CURRENT SYSTEM

03:28:27.194 --> 03:28:29.129
MODIFIED TO SERVE THEM OR WE DO

03:28:29.196 --> 03:28:30.531
WE NEED TO SET UP AN AS WE HAVE

03:28:30.598 --> 03:28:33.000
A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE TO DO SO.

03:28:33.067 --> 03:28:35.069
SORT OF COMPLICATED ALL OF US I

03:28:35.135 --> 03:28:36.470
THINK HAVE THE SAME GOAL AND

03:28:36.537 --> 03:28:38.873
OBJECTIVE OVERALL WHICH IS TO

03:28:38.939 --> 03:28:39.506
MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE

03:28:39.573 --> 03:28:40.808
EDUCATION TO STUDENTS WHERE

03:28:40.875 --> 03:28:42.776
THEY ARE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE

03:28:42.843 --> 03:28:44.812
AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY GET

03:28:44.879 --> 03:28:45.613
A PRODUCT THAT MEANS SOMETHING

03:28:45.679 --> 03:28:48.115
TO THEM. ALL ALL IF NOT ALWAYS

03:28:48.182 --> 03:28:50.618
IS A GOOD PAYING JOB SO.

03:28:50.684 --> 03:28:52.987
OBSERVE QUESTIONS AUGUST

03:28:53.053 --> 03:28:55.522
ANYTHING FURTHER PANELISTS WANT

03:28:55.589 --> 03:28:58.225
TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELLO SIR

03:28:58.292 --> 03:28:59.860
WE COULD I COMMENT ON THE

03:28:59.927 --> 03:29:05.432
ACCREDITATION YES SIR. TWO JUST

03:29:05.499 --> 03:29:05.933
SO YOU YOU HEARD US TALK

03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:06.567
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. NOW AND

03:29:06.634 --> 03:29:08.602
READ. ACCREDITATION BUT WE

03:29:08.669 --> 03:29:10.371
NEVER REALLY TOLD YOU WHAT THE

03:29:10.437 --> 03:29:12.606
DIFFERENCE WAS COMPLETELY. THE

03:29:12.673 --> 03:29:14.141
MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S ONE OF

03:29:14.208 --> 03:29:15.743
THEM IS OF WHETHER YOU HAVE A-

03:29:15.809 --> 03:29:19.046
GOOD OF. A DEGREE IN SOMETHING

03:29:19.113 --> 03:29:21.248
OTHER THAN GENERAL STUDIES. IS

03:29:21.315 --> 03:29:23.017
THAT CORRECT ACTUALLY IT'S A

03:29:23.083 --> 03:29:24.184
LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN

03:29:24.251 --> 03:29:26.587
THAT I FIGURED. THE US

03:29:26.654 --> 03:29:28.722
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS THE-

03:29:28.789 --> 03:29:30.858
ENTITY THAT RECOGNIZES

03:29:30.925 --> 03:29:34.028
NATIONALLY CREDITORS. ND THEY

03:29:34.094 --> 03:29:36.230
THEY ARE SPECIALIZED CREDITORS

03:29:36.297 --> 03:29:37.431
PROGRAM BASIC CREDITORS FOR THE

03:29:37.498 --> 03:29:40.668
MOST PART THERE IS ONE THAT HAS

03:29:40.734 --> 03:29:44.104
THE SOLE MISSION TO A CREDIT.

03:29:44.171 --> 03:29:45.839
ONLINE CAREER TECHNICAL

03:29:45.906 --> 03:29:49.310
EDUCATION COLLEGES THROUGHOUT

03:29:49.376 --> 03:29:50.744
THE NATION WISCONSIN HAS ONE.

03:29:50.811 --> 03:29:52.546
THAT NATIONAL ACCREDITATION

03:29:52.613 --> 03:29:54.848
CREW IS WHAT CHANCELLOR OAKLEY

03:29:54.915 --> 03:29:55.749
WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT

03:29:55.816 --> 03:29:58.886
PARTICULAR- AGENCY SO WOULD NOT

03:29:58.953 --> 03:30:01.255
NOT BE A REGIONAL IT WOULD BE-

03:30:01.322 --> 03:30:05.893
AT A US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

03:30:05.960 --> 03:30:07.361
DEALING WITH THE REGULATIONS

03:30:07.428 --> 03:30:10.664
AND PROCESS THE LIMITATIONS ON

03:30:10.731 --> 03:30:13.901
NATIONAL VERSUS LOCAL. IS THAT

03:30:13.968 --> 03:30:17.538
THE CREDITS EARNED BY CAL BRIDE

03:30:17.604 --> 03:30:19.907
ARE NOT TRANSFERABLE TO ANY

03:30:19.974 --> 03:30:22.843
OTHER COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA NOT

03:30:22.910 --> 03:30:24.611
CSU NOT UC NOT A COMMUNITY

03:30:24.678 --> 03:30:26.847
COLLEGE WE CAN ONLY ACCEPT

03:30:26.914 --> 03:30:28.649

ACCREDITED- COLLEGES AND

03:30:31.485 --> 03:30:33.554
UNIVERSITIES. SO IF SOMEONE

03:30:33.620 --> 03:30:35.022
DROPPED OUT OF THAT CODING

03:30:35.089 --> 03:30:38.292
CLASS. AND WANTED TO USE THE

03:30:38.359 --> 03:30:40.160
CREDITS THAT THEY HAD EARNED

03:30:40.227 --> 03:30:41.228
TWO COMPLETED AT A COMMUNITY

03:30:41.295 --> 03:30:43.097
COLLEGE IT WOULDN'T BE

03:30:43.163 --> 03:30:45.899
PERMISSIBLE. COULD TALKING BUT

03:30:45.966 --> 03:30:47.901
STRANDED CERTIFICATE HOLDERS AS

03:30:47.968 --> 03:30:49.069
OPPOSED TO SIMPLY STRANDED

03:30:49.136 --> 03:30:51.271
WORKERS YES THAT'S THAT'S

03:30:51.338 --> 03:30:54.108
CORRECT THE CURRENT. MODEL IS

03:30:54.174 --> 03:30:58.846
NON CREDIT. NO BUT THAT COULD

03:30:58.912 --> 03:31:00.014
THEN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

03:31:00.080 --> 03:31:03.083
ACCREDITATION ROOM RIGHT. SO

03:31:03.150 --> 03:31:05.819
IT'S COMPLICATED. ASSEMBLY BUT

03:31:05.886 --> 03:31:08.889
NON CREDIT UNDER CURRENT LAW

03:31:08.956 --> 03:31:10.524
AND REGULATIONS DOESN'T RESULT

03:31:10.591 --> 03:31:12.292
IN ASSOCIATE DEGREE WHICH

03:31:12.359 --> 03:31:14.094
ATTRACTS THE DIRECTION YOU GAVE

03:31:14.161 --> 03:31:16.530
THE COLLEGE IF IT IS AN

03:31:16.597 --> 03:31:17.331
ASSOCIATE DEGREE YOU WOULD HAVE

03:31:17.398 --> 03:31:19.500
TO. AND HAVE TO BE A CREDIT

03:31:19.566 --> 03:31:22.903
DEGREE YES RIGHT YES BUT THAT

03:31:22.970 --> 03:31:25.205
ISN'T THE- SO WITH THAT WITH A

03:31:25.272 --> 03:31:27.941
SPECIFIC CONCENTRATION IS ABOUT

03:31:28.008 --> 03:31:30.110
THAT'S RIGHT SO. WITH NATIONAL

03:31:30.177 --> 03:31:32.813
ACCREDITATION AND THE LIMITS ON

03:31:32.880 --> 03:31:34.848
TRANSFER OF CREDIT BAD CREDIT

03:31:34.915 --> 03:31:37.017
ASSOCIATE DEGREE WOULD ALSO BE

03:31:37.084 --> 03:31:39.486
A STRANDED DEGREE. SO THE

03:31:39.553 --> 03:31:42.022
ACCREDITATION IS MY PRESENTS

03:31:42.089 --> 03:31:45.659
MORE COMPLICATED- LIMITATIONS

03:31:45.726 --> 03:31:48.028

03:59:03.996 --> 03:59:05.264
THE LIST HERE WE'VE BEEN

03:59:05.330 --> 03:59:06.465
TALKING ABOUT DUPLICATION ALL

03:59:06.532 --> 03:59:09.601
DAYS YEAH EXACTLY SO JUST

03:59:09.668 --> 03:59:11.270
ASSUMING THAT THE MONEY IS

03:59:11.336 --> 03:59:14.106
FINITE IT'S CONCERNING BECAUSE

03:59:14.173 --> 03:59:14.940

RIGHT- THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF

03:59:18.444 --> 03:59:19.445
MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR

03:59:19.511 --> 03:59:21.580
APPARENTLY WHEN THE BRICK AND

03:59:21.647 --> 03:59:23.048
MORTAR SCHOOLS ARE STRUGGLING.

03:59:23.115 --> 03:59:25.818
AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING

03:59:25.884 --> 03:59:27.419
TOLD THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH

03:59:27.486 --> 03:59:28.721
MONEY AVAILABLE FOR THINGS LIKE

03:59:28.787 --> 03:59:31.490

SEARCHING ABOUT THIS IS THE

03:59:38.330 --> 03:59:40.566
BEST USE. OF THAT KIND OF MONEY

03:59:40.632 --> 03:59:43.235
BECAUSE- FROM WHAT I KNOW THE

03:59:43.302 --> 03:59:44.136
AMOUNT OF MONEY UNDER

03:59:44.203 --> 03:59:45.270
DISCUSSION HERE IS

03:59:45.337 --> 03:59:47.406
APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO. THE

COLLEGES. AND SO IT'S

03:59:52.377 --> 03:59:53.846
CONCERNING THAT THERE'S THIS

03:59:53.912 --> 03:59:55.814
AMOUNT OF MONEY AVAILABLE WHEN

03:59:55.881 --> 03:59:57.182
ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THE BRICK

03:59:57.249 --> 03:59:59.084
AND MORTAR SCHOOLS STUDENTS ARE

03:59:59.151 --> 04:00:02.054
STRUGGLING TO GET RESOURCES-

04:00:02.121 --> 04:00:02.988

04:00:03.055 --> 04:00:04.723
STRUGGLING TO GET RESOURCES.

04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:07.259

MANY STUDENTS THAT DO NOT

04:00:12.664 --> 04:00:14.600
ACTUALLY HAVE A LAPTOP. SO I'M

04:00:14.666 --> 04:00:16.201
A BIT CONFUSED AS TO HOW

04:00:16.268 --> 04:00:17.069
THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY

04:00:17.136 --> 04:00:20.072
SUCCESSFUL IN ONLINE PROGRAMS.

04:00:20.139 --> 04:00:21.807
WHEN THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE

LAPTOPS OR TABLETS AND THIS

04:00:23.609 --> 04:00:26.245
DOES SEEM CONCERNING TWO OTHER.

04:00:26.311 --> 04:00:27.312
FOLKS THAT ARNOLD VALLEY

04:00:27.379 --> 04:00:29.181
