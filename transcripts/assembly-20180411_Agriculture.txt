GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME. TO THE. CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE. FOR APRIL ELEVENTH I HAD TO LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT APRIL IS ALMOST HALFWAY DONE SO WELCOME TO THE FIRST PART OF OUR OUR HEARING TODAY WHICH IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. OF THE SUBJECT IS THE STATE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE STATE AND WE'LL START WITH THE REMARKS BY SECRETARY KAREN ROSS WELCOME. GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE. JUST FOR YOU. WE ALL FIVE. IF YOU WANT. WANTED TO MAKE. TO MAKE WORKING I HEAR ME NOW OKAY. OKAY. OKAY WE'RE READY TO GET OUR ACT. THERE ARE FEW THINGS SPECIFICALLY THAT YOUR STAFF ASKED ME TO TOUCH ON. BUT I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO DO BECAUSE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE FOR ME IS SUCH. A TREASURE FOR THE STATE FOR THIS NATION THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO START WITH THE NUMBERS AND THE NUMBERS ARE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE FOR AS LONG AS USDA HAS BEEN KEEPING RECORDS OF WHAT THE FARM GATE VALUE IS OF AGRICULTURE. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THE NUMBER ONE STATE FOR OVER SIXTY PLUS YEARS. WE DO THAT WERE A LARGE STATE BUT WE ALSO DO THAT IS THE STATE THAT ALSO HAS FORTY MILLION RESIDENTS WHO ARE HIGHLY URBAN MY STATES THAT HAVE THIS KIND OF PRODUCTIVITY IS PRETTY REMARKABLE. THE MOST RECENT NUMBERS ON THE VALUE OF AGRICULTURE HAS JUST A LITTLE BIT OVER FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AT THE FARM GATE. THAT'S WITHOUT ANY VALUE ADDED AND THAT THAT. INCLUDES OVER FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT COMMODITIES THAT WE GROW HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND OF COURSE THE TRADEMARK OF CALIFORNIA ARE OUR SPECIALTY CROPS SPECIALTY CROPS ARE THOSE FRUITS VEGETABLES TREE KNOTS OLIVE OILS WINES CRAFT FAIRS. UP ALL THOSE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE CAN GROW HERE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA. HAS A MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. THAT MAKES A SPEAR UNIQUE THERE ARE ONLY FIVE OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE WORLD THAT ARE A BLAST WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE THAT GIVES US THAT ABILITY. TO PLAY. AND HARVEST A CROP ALMOST EVERYDAY OF THE YEAR SOMEPLACE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT IT IS THAT WE PRODUCE ITS OVER HALF OF THEM OF THAT NATION'S FRUITS VEGETABLES AND TREE NUTS. WERE THE WORLD'S FOURTH LARGEST WINE PRODUCER WE ARE THAT COUNTRY'S NUMBER ONE MILK PRODUCER. WE HAVE OVER TWENTY CROPS THAT WE PUT WE ARE THE PRODUCER OF OVER NINETY PERCENT. AND THAT'S A LOT OF THE SPECIAL THINGS LIKE ARTICHOKES AND FIGS AND OLIVES THEM WINE GRAPES. WE ALSO IN ADDITION TO BEING ABLE TO BE THE SOURCE OF HEALTHY NUTRITIOUS FOOD FOR OUR CITIZENS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE SHIP THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT WE ALSO NOW SHIPPED OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN DIFFERENT MARKETS ON A GLOBAL BASIS. SO WE ARE A POWERHOUSE WE ARE THE NUMBER ONE AGRICULTURAL X. EXPORTER. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE STAFF WANTED ME TO TALK ABOUT IN ADDITION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF SPECIALTY CROPS. THE FACT IS WE CAN THROW THOSE THINGS HERE. THAT COULD NOT BE EASILY GROWN AND OTHER STATES OR EVEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND I THINK THAT'S A FACT THAT BECAME VERY EVIDENT DURING OUR DROUGHT. THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT STARTED LOOKING OUT FOR MY DINNER PLATE LOOK LIKE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. SO WE CANNOT BE EASILY DUPLICATED BUT THERE ARE SOME DRIVING FORCES FOR AGRICULTURE RIGHT NOW THAT ARE CHANGING THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CALL OUT ABOUT CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS THAT OVER NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FARMS IN THE STATE OUR FAMILY. FARM OPERATIONS. AND EVEN OF THAT REMAINING FIVE PERCENT. MANY OF THOSE ARE FAMILY CORPORATIONS OR THEY'RE HELD IN TRUST OR BY A STATE SO YOU HAVE THE MISCONCEPTION ABOUT CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE THAT THOSE SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FARMS ARE ALL ONE SIZE THEY'RE NOT. IF THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE THAT IS OUR STRENGTH. SO WE HAVE MANY NEW BEGINNING FARMERS FOR DOING VERY SMALL A CREATES ON THE EDGE OF BIG URBAN CENTERS WERE VERY FOCUSED ON DIRECT TO CONSUMER MARKETS. AND THEN WE HAVE LARGE SCALE MULTI GENERATION FAMILY FARMS. WHO THEY ARE VERY FOCUSED ON BEING AND IF THE MOST EFFICIENT PRODUCER TO SHIP THEIR PRODUCTS AROUND THE GLOBE? AND I THINK THAT'S OUR STRENGTH BUT HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE RESILIENCE OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT THE DRIVERS ARE FOR TRANS TODAY THAT WILL MAKE BIG IMPACTS AND CHANGE ON AGRICULTURE GOING FORWARD. THERE'S A COUPLE MAJOR THINGS ONE IS WATER. YOU CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ANYONE IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING. THE. IMPACT OF WATER AND THAT ABSOLUTE NEED FOR MORE CERTAINTY IN OUR WATER SUPPLY. THAT SOMETHING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DEALT WITH FOR THE SEVEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE AND THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THAT THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE. AS WE LOOK AT THE DEMANDS ON CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND A WORLD THAT'S GROWING FROM SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE TO NINE BILLION PEOPLE. AND THE ABSOLUTE NEED FOR FOOD SECURITY WILL REQUIRE US TO MORE THAN DOUBLE PRODUCTIVITY IN AMERICAN AGRICULTURE AND OTHER KINDS OF CROPS WE GROW HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE TIME THAT WE'RE DOING THAT. IT'S GOING TO BE WITH THE SAME OR SMALLER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT THERE WILL BE LESS ARABLE LAND ON A GLOBAL BASIS AND LESS AVAILABLE WATER TO GROW THOSE CROPS. SO WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY. IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE AS WELL AS TO WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES CAN LEARN FROM US TO FEED THEIR PEOPLE. AND THAT'S THAT'S AN AREA OF TECHNOLOGY THAT'S DRIVING A LOT OF THE CHANGE THE OTHER AREA THAT I KNOW YOU'VE ALSO HEARD A LOT ABOUT. IS JUST THE INCREASING CHALLENGES OF HAVING A STABLE WORKFORCE FOR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. THAT'S ALSO DRIVING THE INVESTMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM CUENTA ABOUT THAT. ON WHERE WHERE CAN WE AUTOMATE MARK WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN AUTOMATED HOW DO WE PERFECT THAT HOW DO WE MAKE THAT MORE PRECISE WHICH WILL HELP US BE MORE EFFICIENT. BUT ALSO ONE OF THOSE TASKS THAT EVEN A DECADE AGO WE MIGHT NOT HAVE EVEN ENVISIONED COULD BE AUTOMATED IT ANYWAY. AND THAT'S WHERE THE REAL CHANGE IS COMING AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF THERE WERE EVER GOING TO BE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR. RESEARCH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY IT WOULD BE AROUND HOW DO WE BRING AUTOMATION. TO THE FARM AS THAT HAS COME INTO OUR PACKING HOUSES AS A HUGE NEED AND THAT WILL DRIVE. CHANGE ON CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE TODAY AND IT WILL FOR THE NEXT FEW DECADES TO COME. I WOULD ALSO SAY WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT. IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT AS MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO DO THOSE KINDS OF JOBS THAT REQUIRE MANUAL LABOR. BUT THAT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR MANUAL LABOR A LOT OF OUR SPECIALTY CROPS ARE HIGHLY PERISHABLE A LOT OF CARE IS REQUIRED FOR THAT. SO THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AT OTHER WAYS OF MAKING SURE WE HAVE A STABLE WORKFORCE ONE IS HOW CAN WE HELP BRING ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION SO PEOPLE HAVE CAREER LADDERS. WHETHER IT'S AROUND FOOD SAFETY IRRIGATION SPECIALIZATION PASSED US PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS AN ALTERNATIVE PASS MANAGEMENT WAYS. BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WEATHER IS FOR MANUAL LABOR JOBS OR ALL THOSE JOBS THAT ARE BEING CREATED BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION. THAT WE DO NEED PEOPLE TO BE THE PROGRAMMERS WE DO NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO REPAIR IT THOSE KINDS OF PIECES OF EQUIPMENT. AND MAKE THE ADAPTATIONS IN THE FIELD AND IN OUR PACKING HOUSES. WE ALSO SEE THAT MOST PARTS OF ANY SIZE HAVE TO HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE SPECIALISTS AROUND IRRIGATION PEST MANAGEMENT. AND INCREASINGLY BEING INVOLVED WITH OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE. AS I WANTED TO CLOSE MY COMMENTS TODAY BY TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE ENTRAPPED RESILIENCY. POPULIST OBVIOUSLY THIS LEGISLATURE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. AND OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE BUT WE ALSO WITH THE UPDATE OF OUR SCOPING PLAN. WE ALSO HAVE ADOPTED A STRATEGY AROUN NATURAL WORKING LANDSCAPES. WHICH IS A CRITICAL NEW STRATEGY BECAUSE THAT ABILITY TO MANAGE. AND TO APPLY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON OUR LAND TO SEQUESTER CARBON GIVES US A CHANCE TO MEDICATE IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO MEDICAID CLIMATE. AND BE THOSE CARBON SINKS TO QUESTION CARBON SO I WANTED TO TOUCH VERY BRIEFLY ON THE PROGRAMS THAT CDFA. IT'S BEEN ABLE TO FUND WITH CLIMATE CHANGE INVESTMENT DOLLARS. AND IS A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IN THAT DEPTH OF THE DROUGHT WE CREATED THE STATEWIDE WATER EFFICIENCY PROGRAM WHICH IS ALL ABOUT ON FARM WATER USE EFFICIENCY. THAT WILL IMPROVE THE EFFICIENT USE OF WATER REDUCE WATER USE REDUCE ENERGY USE AND THEREFORE REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM OVER FIVE HUNDRED PROJECTS OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES WITH REAL WATER SAVINGS AND REAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS OVERSUBSCRIBED BY THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. SO WE ARE VERY PLEASED THAT THERE ARE SOME FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT'S IN THE BOND THAT WILL BE ON ON THE BALLOT AND WE HOPE THAT THAT PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE GREENHOUSE GAS INVESTMENT DOLLARS. BUT NEITHER PROGRAM THAT HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION AND IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM IS FOR OUR TERRY'S WE HAVE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DAIRY COWS IN THE STATE. WE WANT TO REDUCE METHANE WAS A SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. AND WE HAVE FUNDED DAIRY DIE TESTERS THAT ARE CREATING RENEWABLE ENERGY. EITHER ELECTRICITY FOR THE FARM ITSELF I TAKE. TAKE A LOAD OFF THE BREAD BUT VERY EXCITINGLY THE ABILITY TO GENERATE RENEWABLE. NATURAL GAS TO HEAT OUR HOMES AND TO RUN HOPEFULLY AS A LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION FUEL. THE TRUCKS AND BIG EQUIPMENT GOING UP AND DOWN THE CENTRAL VALLEY HIGHWAYS I THINK THAT'S AN EXCITING NEW OPPORTUNITY WE NEED SOME STABILITY AND CERTAINTY IN THOSE PROGRAMS AS WE PROTRACTED. MORE DEVELOPERS TO COME INTO THIS. BUT THE DAIRY SECTOR HAS STEPPED UP AND CALIFORNIA GOING FROM THREE JERRY DIED TESTERS A FEW SHORT YEARS AGO TO BEING THE NUMBER ONE STATE AND NOTHING REDUCTION IS A PRETTY LAUDABLE. ACCOMPLISHMENT AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE DOING THAT WE ALSO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WHICH FITS IN VERY NICELY WITH AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT APPROACH. WHERE WE CAN USE THAT WHAT WE USED TO THINK OF AS WASTE? AS SOMETHING THAT HAS VALUABLE NUTRIENTS IN AT HOW CAN WE DO A SEPARATION HOW DO WE CAN WE GET THAT INTO COMPOSTING. BUT AT THE OTHER BYPRODUCTS COULD BE CREATED WITH S. AND COULD BE MOVED TO AREAS THAT ARE. NUTRIENT. DEFICIT ADDED AND GET IT OUT OF AREAS WHERE THEY THEY HAVE AT. A LARGE BALANCES THAT SO THAT PROGRAM FITS VERY NICELY% WITH A HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM WHICH IS AN EXCITING PROGRAM THAT REALLY IS ABOUT WHAT OF THOSE PRACTICES THAT WE COULD PUT ON THE GROUND TO SEQUESTER CARBON. AND INCREASE THE CARBON IN OUR SOILS THE ORGANIC MATTER IN OUR SOILS SO THAT THEY CAN RETAIN MORE WATER. AND HELP WITH GOOD PRODUCTIVITY FOR PLANTS IT'S AN EXCITING NEW PROGRAM WE JUST STARTED THAT LAST YEAR WE HAVE OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS OUT TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS AROUND THE STATE. IT'S ONE THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO EXPANDING UM AND A TREMENDOUS KIND OF WAY. THOSE ARE JUST PART OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE INVESTMENT DOLLARS WE ALSO AS YOU KNOW MADAM CHAIR FROM SERVING ON THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. FOR TWO YEARS IN A ROW NOW WE'VE HAD FORTY MILLION DOLLARS GOING INTO FARMLAND CONSERVATION GRANTS THOSE OUR EASEMENT PROGRAMS. THAT ARE VERY VERY POPULAR PEOPLE CARE PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE LAND BEING ABLE TO KEEP BUT IN AGRICULTURE AND IN THE FAMILY AND THOSE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL CROWDS. THIS PAST YEAR WE ALSO. HAD SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO HELP OUR FOOD PROCESSING SECTOR IMPROVE ITS ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT KEEPING THE CROPS IN THE STATE IS VITALLY IMPORTANT AND KEEPING THE ABILITY TO PROCESS THEM AND PROXIMITY TO WHERE THEY'RE BEING CROWNED. IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT SO REALLY PARTNERING WITH THE FOOD PROCESSING SECTOR. TO HELP THEM BE MORE EFFICIENT AND TO IMPROVE THEIR ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT AND I WOULD. HOPE THAT YOU ALL UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT AS I'M SURE THAT YOU DO. I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THIS CHANCE TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY BUT I WANT TO CLOSE WITH A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS. CDF PHASE HISTORIC MISSION HAS BEEN TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE FROM INVASIVE PASS. AND PLANT AND ANIMAL DISEASES THAT'S A CORE MISSION OF WHAT WE DO IT IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT WE DO. CLIMATE CHANGE HAS A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THAT. IN TWENTY ELEVEN I CONVENED A CLIMATE CHANGE CONSORTIUM AROUND SPECIALTY CROPS AND WE LAID OUT A ROADMAP OF WHERE THE RESEARCH NEEDS ARE. AND WHERE WE ANTICIPATE THE NEED FOR US TO ADAPT ON OUR FARMS. CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE HAS A LOT AT STAKE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE SO WE REALLY NEED TO INVEST AND HELPING THEM. ADAPT WITH NEW PLANT BREEDING PROGRAMS AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS GO WITHOUT. WE ALSO. AS PART OF AGRICULTURE HAVE DEFIED THE PURPOSE OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE WHICH WE ALL INTUITIVELY NOW BUT WOULD NEVER PUT IT INTO A PURPOSE STATEMENT IN AG FISSION. THAT THE PURPOSE OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE BECAUSE OF WHAT WE TROUT. AND HOW WE PER HOUR. WE HAVE SOMETHING HERE. THAT IS NOT EASILY FOUND IN OTHER PLACES THIS HEALTHY NUTRITIOUS FOOD SOURCE THAT'S LITERALLY IN OUR BACKYARD WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS ACCESS TO THAT HEALTHY FOOD. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR STANDARDS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. AND LABOR PROTECTION ARE SOME OF THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD IF NOT THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD AND THAT JUSTIFIES EVERY CALIFORNIANS WANTED TO SUPPORT. CALIFORNIA GROWN FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE WE DEFINITELY HAVE OUR CHALLENGES. WATER AND LABOR LEAD THAT BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SECRETARY FOR BEING HERE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR. YOUR. BROAD VIEW IT'S IT'S AND IT I MEAN I TOOK SOME NOTES HERE AND IT'S INCREDIBLE EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THE. LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND. SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN AGRICULTURE THAT. REALLY I THINK ARE PART OF OUR GOAL TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS AND TO. BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE A GOOD HIGH QUALITY. PRODUCE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB QUINCY IF ANYBODY IN THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. NOW I THINK I THINK. WHERE YOU HAVE LOT TO THINK ABOUT? BUT I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY AND AND KIND OF GIVING US AN OVERVIEW AT ME GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY AS WE DO OUR WORK TO REALLY FOCUS AND THEN. AND DUMPED. AND DIG DEEP IN ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND THESE ISSUE AREAS AS WE START SPENDING GREENHOUSE GAS. OF DOLLARS AND. MAKING SURE I'M ALL OF US ON HERE ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING AGRICULTURE IN THE STATE. SO ALL MY. WE KNOW THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME LIKE TO NOW. INVITE. GLENDALE HUMUS TEN WHO IS THE VICE PRESIDENT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES TO. GIVE US MORE INFORMATION. GREAT. THANK YOU COULD CHAIRMAN OF CHAIR OF THE EURO AND AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY MIGHT MY NAME IS GOING TO HOUSTON. I'M CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH ALL REFERRED IN THIS IS A AND ARE. YOU SEE A IN OUR IS A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF HUNDREDS OF UC RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATORS PROVIDING SCIENCE BASED INFORMATION TO FAMILIES FARMERS. RANCHERS NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGERS COMMUNITIES AND POLICYMAKERS I ACTUALLY HAVE A COUPLE DOCUMENTS THAT. WOULD LIKE THE THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE THAT ALL REFER TO. THEN I'LL DO SOME HIGHLIGHTS IN MY PREPARED REMARKS. ONE IS A. BUT ANNUAL REPORT THAT WE JUST PUT UP FOR THE FIRST TIME THE SHERIFFS ARE TEMPTED ONE I'M SURE BE BETTER NEXT YEAR BUT WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT TO THE DIVERSITY OF THE RESEARCH AND THE. DELIVERY OF PROGRAMS HAPPENING THROUGH THE STATE OF WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN THIS IS OUR SIX STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WITH JUST A FEW VIGNETTES OF DELIVERABLES. WE LITERALLY HAVE THOUSANDS OF RESEARCH PROJECTS GOING ON AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT OUR SIX STRATEGIC INITIATIVES INCLUDE UP ONES AROUND ENDEMIC IN INVASIVE PESTS AND DISEASE WHICH WE JUST HEARD SECRETARY ROSS SPEAKS SO ABLY ABOUT. HEALTHY FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS. SUSTAINABLE NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS. WATER QUALITY QUANTITY AND SECURITY. AND THEN SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. THESE ARE INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE A WIDE ARRAY OF WORK GROUPS AND PROGRAM TEAMS ARE COORDINATING RESEARCH AROUND. BUT IN IN A BROADER SENSE. WE ARE REALLY THE PUBLIC SERVICE ARM AT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WITH RESEARCHERS ON SEVERAL CAMPUSES AND NEARLY EVERY COUNTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ALL ARE A IN OUR SCIENTISTS ARE ENGAGED IN THE FULL RANGE OF BASIC TO APPLIED SCIENCE WORKING CLOSELY WITH FARMERS. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER PARTNERS TO DISK DISCOVER AND DELIVER SOLUTIONS. THEY IN ARE TRULY IS THE FACE OF YOU SEE FOR HUNDREDS. OF COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE THE ONE PAGE OF DOCUMENTS I'VE GIVEN YOU WAS AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE YOU JUST AN OVERVIEW OF THE NUMBERS THEMSELVES. UP AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE OFFICES IN ALL BUT TWO COUNTIES. ALPINE COUNTY IN SAN FRANCISCO HOWEVER BOTH OF THOSE COUNTIES ARE SERVED FROM NEIGHBORING OFFICES. ADVISERS IN THOSE COUNTIES WORK WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF PROGRAMS OR RESEARCH EXTENSION CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO HOST HUNDREDS OF RESEARCH PROJECTS. AND THEN OUR AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION HAS SEVERAL HUNDRED RESEARCHERS AND OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED RESEARCH PROJECTS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT. THIS IS PART OF THE LAND GRANT UNIVERSITY MISSION OF CALIFORNIA ON THE BACK OF THAT YOU'LL SEE A LISTING OF OUR STATEWIDE PROGRAMS AND INSTITUTES. AND AYE PITIFULLY ONE HIGHLIGHT THE. PROGRAMS THAT HAVE VOLUNTEERS WE HAVE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS WORKING WITH FOR H. MASTER GARDENERS MASTER FOOD PRESERVERS AND ARE CALIFORNIAN NATURALIST. ABOUT ONE OF THE NEWEST PROGRAMS THE CALIFORNIA NATURALS IS CURRENTLY PUTTING TOGETHER IS SOMETHING CALLED CLIMATE STEWARDS WERE WE'RE GOING TO BE GIVING MORE CITIZENS BOTH ADULTS AND YOUTH. OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN CITIZEN SCIENCE AROUND. UP CLIMATE CHANGE. THE BOTTOM IS A SNAPSHOT OF OUR PAST YOUR SPUN SOURCES AND USES WHICH IS IN THE ANNUAL REPORT BUT IT'S A LITTLE EASIER TO READ ON THAT ONE PAGE JOURNAL LARGER. PART COUNTY BASED COOPERATIVE EXTENSION ADVISORS WORK WITH TEAMS OF NON ACADEMIC STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS TO DELIVER THE SERVICES THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS FOR AGE AND OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT MASTER GARDENERS AND OUR STATE WIDE WATER RESEARCH INSTITUTE. A IN OURS COOPERATIVE EXTENSION ADVISORS OR THE UC SCIENTISTS TO WORK IN THE FIELD THEY GET DIRT UNDER THEIR FINGERNAILS AND HAVE. HELP FARMERS AND RANCHERS SOLVE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS. WE HAVE ADVISERS THAT SPECIALIZE IN IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY CLIMATE CHANGE PEST MANAGEMENT AND NUTRITION AS WELL AS DOZENS OF OTHER TOPICS. WE CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS ON HOW TO CULTIVATE THE OVER FOUR HUNDRED COMMODITIES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO HELP MANAGE CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES A LARGE PROJECT RECENTLY HAS BEEN FLOODING OF FARMLAND TO IMPROVE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE. MORE RECENTLY A FACT UP THE CASE OF WHERE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY ON PRE FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS. DURING THE DISASTER THEMSELVES ONE OF THE FIRST CALLS THAT GO OUT DURING A NATURAL DISASTER SUCH AS THE RECENT FIRES IS TO OUR FOUR H. CLUBS. WHEN OF PETS AND LIVESTOCK OR EVACUATED FROM A DISASTER AREA TO THE FAIRGROUNDS OR FOR EIGHT YEARS OF THE ONE TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE ANIMALS ARE AS WE PARTICULARLY SAW ON RIVERSIDE CINEMA COUNTIES RECENTLY. IN JANUARY. EIGHT BILLION ARE AND CDFA HER CO HOST OF AN INVASIVE SPECIES SUMMIT HERE IN THIS BUILDING. THIS WAS DESIGNED TO BRING TOGETHER VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SCIENTIST. TO CREATE A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY INVASIVE SPECIES PREVENTION PROGRAM THE FINAL REPORT ON THAT IS NEARLY READY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING THAT WITH YOU. THERE'S A SERIOUS NEED TO PREVENT INVASIVE SPECIES INTRODUCTION AND SPREAD THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. EVERY FIVE WEEKS A NEW PEST IS ENTERING CALIFORNIA EVERY FIVE WEEKS IT'S KIND OF FRIGHTENING I USED TO JOKE THAT THERE WAS A NEW BOOK EVERY MONTH. AND I GOT CORRECTED THAT IT WAS FIVE WEEKS I I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I WAS JOKING TO BE HONEST. BOOKED OUT IT IS TRULY FIVE WEEKS WE'RE CURRENTLY FIGHTING ASIAN CITRUS SALUTE AND LONG LONG BEING WHICH IS DEVASTATING THE SICK PERSON INTEREST DRAIN FLORIDA AND WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO. NOT HAVE THAT HAPPEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND AND DISEASES THAT ARE JUST AFFECTING ADD ONE OF THE BIG BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW DOWN IN THE ORANGE LA RIVERSIDE COUNTY AREA. IS SHOT HOLE BORDER WHICH IS DEVASTATING URBAN FOREST AND COULD POTENTIALLY JUMP INTO THE AVOCADO SECTOR. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT OUR WORK TO SUPPORT INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN OUR RURAL SECTOR PARTICULARLY AROUND AG TECHNOLOGY. A IN OUR IS CONNECTING CALIFORNIA'S FOOD VALLEY'S WAS SILICON VALLEY TO ALIGN CAPITAL INVESTMENT WITH REAL WORLD NEEDS. RECENTLY A IN OUR RECEIVED A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. TO CREATE THE VINE THE VERDE INNOVATION NETWORK FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE VINE CONNECTS ENTREPRENEUR STATEWIDE WITH FOOD AG AND NATURAL RESOURCE EXPERTS AND IS CATALYZING THE SUPPORT TO TAKE IDEAS TO COMMERCIALIZATION. WE EXPECT THAT THESE CONNECTIONS WILL CATALYZE INNOVATION THAT WILL REVOLUTIONIZE CURRENT FARMING IN CONSERVATION PRACTICES WERE ALSO WORKING WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS. TO DEVELOP AN AG TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CDFA. FOR INSTANCE A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE'VE GOT GOING ON IS WE NOW CAN USE DRONES TO DETECT PEST DAMAGE ON CROPS SO THAT PESTICIDES MAY BE APPLIED QUICKLY AND MUCH MORE STRATEGICALLY. TO THE AFFECTED AREA RATHER THAN AN ENTIRE FIELD. SCIENTISTS AND ENTREPRENEURS HAVE ALSO DEVELOP PRECISION AG TECHNOLOGY THAT AMONG OTHER BENEFITS. GREATLY REDUCE WATER USE AN INCREASE YIELDS. MANY OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRE CLOUD COMPUTING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND BROADBAND ACCESS SO THAT DATA MAY BE UPLOADED AND DOWNLOADED FROM THE FIELD. AND PROCESSED INTO USABLE ACTIONS I RECENTLY TESTIFIED ON THIS TOPIC BEFORE THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE A COPY OF MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY TO ANY INTERESTED MEMBERS. PROVIDING BROADBAND ACCESS AND RURAL AREAS WILL ALSO BRING INTERNET CONNECTIVITY TO LOCAL RESIDENTS. ALLOWING FOR IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE IN SOME AREAS SOME OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED AREAS OF THE STATE. HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS IS THE GATEWAY TO ONLINE EDUCATION TELEHEALTH AND OTHER IMPORTANT SERVICES. ONE EXAMPLE OF A CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT WE ARE CURRENTLY ORGANIZING WITH OUR FOUR H. YOUTH IS TO ASSIST THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. IMPROVING THE MAPS OF WHAT THE BROADBAND ACCESS AND QUALITY IS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES TO GET FUNDING IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE IS THAT THERE ISN'T REALLY GOOD MAPPING. THE CP YOU SEE IS DEVELOPED AN APP FOR THE PHONE CALLED CAL SPEED WE'RE HAVING ALL OF OUR FOR H. MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE DOWNLOAD THAT. AND DURING THE WEEK THIS SUMMER THEY'LL BE RUNNING TESTS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY FOR A WEEK THAT WILL. DOCUMENT HOW GOOD THE UPLOAD DOWNLOAD SPEED IS THE QUALITY OF THE SIGNAL GEO REFERENCE THAT AND SHIP IT STRAIGHT TO THE CPUC. AND THEN THEY AND ARE IN INFORMATICS AND SHOULD BE AYE YES MAPPING A STATEWIDE PROGRAM WORK TOGETHER WITH THEM. TO OUR IMPROVE THOSE MAPS AND USE THEM TO HELP TARGET INVESTMENTS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO IMPROVE THAT. IT'S EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE MANY CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT WHERE EXPANDING RIGHT NOW FOR BOTH OUR YOUTH AND ADULTS. WE'RE ALSO VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT PROVISIONS TO CREATE SMART FORMS AND AND THE DISCUSSION ON THAT AT THE YOU SEE SEE ISSUE COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND FAIRGROUNDS. IN FACT A IN OUR HAS BEEN WORKING FOR SOME TIME TO EXPAND OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE CSU SYSTEM AND OUR COLLEGES. RIGHT NOW WE'RE PURSUING SOME OPPORTUNITIES IN FACT. ONE THING THAT HAS BAFFLED ME SINCE THE DAY I TOOK THIS POSITION WAS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A RESEARCH EXTENSION CENTER IN THE SALINAS VALLEY. WHICH SEEMS VERY WRONG ON MANY LEVELS. OF NOT HAVING THE TWENTY OR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SET SUCH A THING UP. THE PRESIDENT APART NO COMMUNICATIVE GIN I ARE REALLY LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN PARTNER WITH THEIR LAND AND FACILITIES UC RESEARCHERS AND THE USDA FACILITY THERE. TO CREATE THE FIRST EVER YOU SEE COMMUNITY COLLEGE RESEARCH EXTENSION CENTER. IT NOT ONLY WILL FACILITATE THAT KIND OF RESEARCH I'VE BEEN DESCRIBING ALREADY BUT WILL GIVE THOSE COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS OFF WIDE ARRAY OF NEW CAREER PATHS TO BE LOOKING AT AND AND HAVING EXPERIENCE WITH. WE'RE ALSO VERY EXCITED ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES ON COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS. WE SEE THEM AS A CRUCIAL PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT ROLE CALIFORNIA AND HAVE SEVERAL PROJECTS IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN ACTUALLY USING THEM AS THE SITES OF INCUBATORS A MAKER LABS AND. OPPORTUNITIES TO HOST ENTREPRENEURS. WITH THAT I WILL WRAP UP MY COMMENTS BY REITERATING THAT YOU SEE A IN OUR IS HERE TO PROVIDE RESEARCH EDUCATION AND PUBLIC SERVICE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. THIS YEAR YOU SEE IS CELEBRATING ITS CESCO CENTENNIAL. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS. I LIKE TO SAY THAT A IN ART IS THE ORIGINAL INCUBATOR AND THE TECH SUPPORT FOR FARMERS AND RANCHRS BRINGING SCIENCE AND INNOVATION TO WORLD WAR. REAL WORLD PROBLEMS FOR THESE PAST FOR A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AS WELL AND PARTNERING WITH YOU ON THAT. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. THAT WIDE SCOPE OF OF THINGS THAT THE UC IS INVOLVED IN AND YOUR WORK AT YOU SEE AN ARMS BEEN TRICKED TREMENDOUS. AND AND TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL FOR THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS WE'VE LOOKED AT A ISSUES ALL OVER THE STATE. MISTER MISTER. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND THAT LET'S GET THAT. A FACILITY GOING IN SALINAS I LIKE. THE IDEA I MEAN WE WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT IT'S ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE. VALLEYS IN IN THE STATE AND TO NOT HAVE A A RESEARCH INSTITUTION THEY'RE OUT WORKING WITH PART NOW COLLEGE IS THAT. THE IT OVERSIGHT IT THEY'RE DOING SOME TREMENDOUS WORK AT THEIR THEIR COULD PARTNER. ACTUALLY THE FACILITY WE HAVE DOWN IN THE VENTURA SANTA BARBARA AREA IS NOT ADEQUATE EITHER WERE PARTNERING THERE WERE LOOKING APARTMENT THERE WAS CSU CHANNEL ISLANDS. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE KIND OF PARTNERSHIPS ALL OVER THE STATE BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT'S HOW WE BETTER LEVERAGE OUR FINITE RESOURCES AND BETTER SERVE OUR CITIZENS ON EVERY SINGLE REGION HAS. THE CLAIM IT'S DIFFERENT THE SOILS DIFFERENT BUT THE CROPS THAT ARE BEING GROWN ARE DIFFERENT SO TO pLOOK AT THAT AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE. BEST SOLUTIONS ARE FOR INCREASING YIELD AND PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT UP OPPORTUNITY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY APPRECIATE YOUR. TESTIMONY. AND. WAT THAT WILL MOVE ON TO OUR? AGENDA. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START A SUCH AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. WE NEED A QUORUM AND WE WERE CLOSE AND THEN WE LOST IT SO WELL WE'LL GET IT BACK AYE AYE YEAH I REMAIN CONFIDENT. I'M IN. IF THERE ARE THERE A LOT OF COMMITTEES AND. WE'RE GONNA WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE OUR TIME AND DO IT RIGHT SO LET ME JUST SAY THAT IN TO IN REGARDS TO THE AGENDA TODAY. OUT WE HAD EIGHT ITEMS ON THE AGENDA IS ITEM NUMBER EIGHT WHICH IS AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY NINE BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR AUTHOR WILL BE HEARD TODAY. PUMP EXPECT. IT MAY COME BACK. SO WORLD WILL MOVE ON IN OUR AGENDA. TO WALT WILL TAKE UP THAN THE NON. COMMITTEE MEMBER AGENDA ITEMS AND I DON'T SEE ANYBODY HERE. SO YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ASKED WE HAVE. SO. SO I GUESS WHAT WE OUGHT TO START DOING IS CALLING. THE ABSENT INDIVIDUALS. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY HERE. I CAN DO MY OWN MISTER LEVINE. PERFECT TIMING THOSE WHO MAKE THEIR TIME. MR LEVINE LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE UP. I'M IF WE COULD CALL ITEM NUMBER SIX ON THE AGENDA WITCHES AB TWENTY EIGHT TEN. SON GROWN CANNABIS COMMISSION. SOUNDS GET. I THINK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT. TO PRESENT AB TWENTY EIGHT TEN WHICH WOULD CREATE THE CALIFORNIA SUN GROWN CANNABIS COMMISSION SINCE THE EARLY SEVENTIES THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE'S VOTED AUTHORIZED THE CREATION OF MORE THAN. NINE OUT TWENTY FIVE AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONS TODAY NINETEEN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE INDUSTRY THERE ARE THERE ARE PRESENT. PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR MADE CANNABIS A LEGAL CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT THE SUN GROWN CANNABIS FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER FORMER UN I REPRESENT. THEY'RE CONCERNED WITH MARKET SHARE GOVERNMENT REGULATION COSTS IN SUSTAINABILITY AND TODAY MANY ARE CONCERNED WITH THEIR VERY SURVIVAL. THE COMMISSION CREATED BY THIS BILL WILL REPRESENT OUTDOOR CANNABIS FARMERS I AND II WITH WITH EITHER AN OUTDOOR. OR MIXED LIGHT LICENSE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE THE TRADITIONAL SMALL FAMILY OPERATIONS MANY WHICH HAVE BEEN FARMING FOR DECADES IF APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED INTO LAW THE SUN GROWN COMMISSION WILL ONLY TAKE EFFECT UPON A SUCCESSFUL VOTE. OF THOSE PRODUCERS INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION THE COMMISSION WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH OFFICES HIRE STAFF PROVIDE FOR EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. CONTRACT FOR SCIENTIFIC STUDIES IN REPRESENTS GROWERS BEFORE LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS THESE FARMERS A NUMBER OF WHOM ARE HERE TODAY POPE TO BUILD UPON. THE SUCCESS OF OTHER FARMERS INTRIGUING ENTITY THAT HELPS THEM SURVIVE IN A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE I WANTED TO READ. THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE COMMISSION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FOR WHY WANTED NOW ALSO PRESENT TO YOU. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING INDOOR CANNABIS GROWERS AS WELL. AND THEY HAVE ASKED IF I WOULD INCLUDE IN THIS LEGISLATION. AN INDOOR CANNABIS COMMISSION AS WELL THAT IS INDEPENDENT FROM THE SUN GROWN CANNABIS COMMISSION AND DISTINCT AND SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU. THAT I DECIDED THAT WE JUST AGREED TO. MOMENTS AGO BUT THAT I'D COMMITTED TO THEM TO DO DIED TO DIE REMOVE OPPOSITION AND TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR THIS LEGISLATION. THE THE BREAKING IT IS. SO. YEAH SO THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY IS FOR THE SUN GROWN CANNABIS COMMISSION. I HAVE WORKED WITH STAKEHOLDERS OUT REPRESENTING INDOOR CANNABIS. THAT'S RIGHT. AND. AND SO THEY HAVE ASKED OF ME AND I'VE COMMITTED TO THEM TO INCLUDE IN THIS LEGISLATION AN INDOOR CANNABIS COMMISSION THAT WOULD SUPPORT. THAT THE PROFESSIONALISM AND PROFESSIONALIZATION. OF THAT FORMING ENTITY THE SAME WAY THAT THE SUN GOING CANNABIS COMMISSION WOULD. THE INTERESTS OF THE TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE. LONG TERM VERY SIMILAR BUT SHORT TERM AS A. BECOME REGULATED BECOME LICENSED BECOME PROFESSIONAL AYE IS BUT THEY ARE UNIQUE AND THAT IS SENT OUT IN A SENSE WHY OTHERS IN THE FOR THE TWO SEPARATE COMMISSIONS. OKAY I'M SORRY FOR THE SURPRISE IT IT WAS A BIT OF A SURPRISE TO ME TOO. SO SO I AM APPRECIATE. IT THAT THIS I CONCLUDE YOUR TESTIMONY IF I COULD JUST TAKE A BREAK RA QUICKEN TAKE ROLL CALL. SOUNDS GET IN AT ALL INTEREST WITH US OKAY ACCOUNTS GOOD. THE ROLL CALL PLEASE COMEY ARE OUT HERE APPAREL HERE MATHIS HERE MATHIS HERE AGUILAR CURRY. FLORA. GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER HERE GRAY EGGMAN. EGGMAN HERE. GRAY HERE JONES SAWYER. LEVINE. HERE LIVING HERE SALAS ROSA. SALAS HERE CORONARY WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. SO YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WITH ME IN SUPPORT TODAY OF AB TWENTY TENNIS CHRISTIAN OF IT ALL PRESIDENT THE INTERNATIONAL CANNABIS FARMERS ASSOCIATION AND A FORMER HERSELF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HAS SOME COMMENTS PREPARED SO. AS PENSION MANY MISS KRISTEN OF ALL. AYE A LIVING CARGO CALIFORNIA AND I AM A LONG TIME MEDICAL CANNABIS FARMER MYSELF BECAUSE ONE OF THE CO FOUNDERS OF THE EMERALD GROWERS ASSOCIATION ALSO SERVE ON THE CALIFORNIA CANVAS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AND SEPARATE US CCA'S AGRICULTURAL. COMMITTEE CHAIR. I AM THE FOUNDING CHAIR OF THE INTERNATIONAL CANVAS FARMERS ASSOCIATION IN SHORT I HAVE DEDICATED MOST OF MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO PROMOTING BEST PRACTICES FOR SOME GROWN CANNABIS FARMERS. AND A HEALTHY SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. EARLY ONE I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR. THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT A SON GROWN CANNABIS COMMISSION. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS QUESTIONS WHICH ON YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS IS KIND OF A SURPRISE TO ME TOO. BUT ABOUT WHY. TO SEPARATE A COMMISSIONS WOULD BE NECESSARY. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE DO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO SEPARATE AG COMMISSIONS. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SON GROWN A COMMISSION VERSUS AN ALL INCLUSIVE AG COMMISSION. REALLY IS THE FACT THAT OUT TORN MIX LATE TIER ONE FARMERS WHICH WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE SUN GROWN A COMMISSION. HAVE VERY DIFFERENT MEANS IN THE INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY NOR ARE THEY SUBJECT TO. DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE REGULATIONS BOTH OF THESE PIECES ARE NOT ONLY INCREDIBLY ONEROUS BUT INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE TUCSON GROUND FARMERS MANY OF WHOM. ALSO FARM ON THE LAND IN WHICH THEY LIVE ON THEIR FARM IN THEIR HOME STATES. AND SO WHILE SOME GROUND CULTIVATORS BASED ON THE STATE'S. OF OUR PIR POTENTIALLY MAKE UP EIGHTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS CULTIVATORS CURRENTLY THEY ONLY RECOGNIZE ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET SHARE. SO WHILE WE ARE THE UNDERDOG IN MANY WAYS. WE ARE ALSO THE MOST HEAVILY REGULATED AND SPENDING THE MOST MONEY TO TRY TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE IN A REGULATED MARKETPLACE. ADDITIONALLY THE RESEARCH NEEDS OF SOME GROUND CULTIVATORS ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE RESEARCH NEEDS OF INDOOR MIX LATER TO CULTIVATORS. ON THE RESEARCH THAT WE REALLY NEED IS A ASSISTANCE IN DEVELOPING AN APPELLATION OF ORIGIN ON ASSISTANCE IN IN SHARING NOT OUR ACTIVITIES. BECOME MORE SUSTAINABLE ON LEAVE A SMALLER FOOTPRINT AND ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY WITHIN OUR WATER SHUTS. THE RESEARCH THAT'S NEEDED FOR INDOOR CULTIVATORS LARGELY AS A TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT RIGHT HOW CAN ENTER CULTIVATORS RELYING ON HIGH INTENSITY DISCHARGE LIGHTING TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CULTIVATE YEAR ROUND. THIS IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT I'M MORE EFFICIENCY IS THE TECHNOLOGICAL AREA SO THEY CAN REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT THAT'S OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH IN HIGH INTENSITY DISCHARGE LIGHT USAGE. TWO VERY DIFFERENT ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM CLEARLY SON SPECTRUM VERSUS LIGHTS PATTERN. SO. WE REALLY. WANT TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL ASPECTS OF THE INDUSTRY ARM WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT I AM. AMONGST SOME GROUND CULTIVATORS WE TEND TO BE THE SMALLEST PRODUCERS IN THE STATE AND THEN OF THE SUN GROWN CULTIVATOR THE SPECIALTY COTTAGE HERE. THEY ARE AT MOST RISK OF GOING EXTINCT AND SO WE REALLY SPECIFICALLY LOOK FORWARD TO. HELPING THEM OUT WITH THE SUN GROWN A COMMISSION WERE LOOKING AT TIERED ASSESSMENTS. THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM THE ABILITY TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF AND PARTICIPATE IN A SUN GROWN A COMMISSION WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING TO PAY ASSESSMENTS. SO WE WOULD SCALE THE ASSESSMENTS UPS OF THE LARGER. AND THE MORE YOU PRODUCE AS A SIGN GROUND FARMER THE MORE ASSESSMENT YOU PAYS SO IT HELPS TO LIFT THE ENTIRE. INDUSTRY OP AS IT GOES ON THE LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY PRETTY BOILERPLATE HATE OR WORKING ON. NUMEROUS EVENTS TO GATHER STAKEHOLDER INPUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE EMBODY THE NEEDS OF THE SONOGRAM FARMERS. WE HAVE HELD LISTENING% ADVANCING UKIAH EUREKA SANTA BARBARA AND MONTEREY SO FAR WILL BE IN SAN RAFAEL ON FRIDAY. AND THEN WE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING IT ALL OVER AGAIN TO GET MORE INPUT SO. I REALLY THINK YOU FOR LETTING ME TAKE THE TIME TO. EXPRESS OUR NEEDS AND OUR CONCERNS RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT SPELLING HOPES MOVE IT FORWARD THINKING EVERY MATCH. HI THANK YOU THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CRYSTAL ORTIZ AND I AM ALSO A SMALL LICENSE HOLDER. AND I'M COME FROM A MULTI GENERATIONAL CANNABIS FAMILY UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'M I WAS BORN IN MENDOCINO IN THE HEIGHT OF THE BACK TO THE LAND MOVEMENT. OF MY FAMILY DID NOT SURVIVE THE DRUG WAR INTACT AND I SPENT MY MOST OF MY CHILDHOOD IN TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURE. MY MOM TOOK US WITH HER LOVE FOR AGRICULTURE INTO THE DESERT SOUTHWEST WHERE SHE RAISED VEGETABLE SEEDS AND CONTRACTED FARMS FOR PRODUCTION. AND SO I GREW UP IN A MORE TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURE. CITING A MY MOVE BACK TEHAMA COUNTY TWENTY YEARS AGO AND I'M A PART OF THAT CANNABIS CULTURE AND THE BACK TO AND MOVEMENT THAT EXISTS THERE STILL TO OUR VALUES AND OUR. COMMUNITY. AND SEE THROUGH THIS CHANGING REGULATORY LANDSCAPE THAT SON GROUND CANNABIS HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH AGRICULTURE THAN IT DOES WITH INDOOR CANNABIS WHILE WE HAVE MANY SIMILARITIES WHERE WE WILL COME TOGETHER. SANGRAM CANNABIS FACES ALL THESE UNIQUE REGULATORY NEEDS I DON'T NEED TO GET INTO THEM SINCE SHE DID BUT WE ON OURS SUPER TINY FARMS. FACE THE TRADITIONAL SEASONAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS RECENTLY CLIMATE CHANGE AND FIRES AND MUD SLIDES NEW PASS WE FACE. RAINFALL ALL KINDS OF SEASONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND JUST WORKING WITHIN THAT WINDOW OF THE NATURAL SEASONS IN ADDITION TO FISH AND WILDLIFE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD ROAD ASSOCIATIONS AND ALL OF THESE ADDITIONAL. SCHOOL BUS THAT SETBACKS IN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE FACE. I'M WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO AMORTIZE THOSE COSTS AND SO EVERYTHING THAT KAREN ROSS SPOKE ON THIS MORNING WAS DEAR TO OUR HEART WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WE TALK ABOUT CARBON SEQUESTRATION WE TALK ABOUT. CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY AND CALIFORNIA SUNSHINE AND HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS AND IT'S PART OF OUR STORY. AND WANTING TO SEE THAT SIGNED ON CULTIVATORS HAVE A VEHICLE TO. TELL THAT STORY WITHOUT THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER INDUSTRY AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO SUPPORT WE WOULD SUPPORT THE CREATION OF OTHER COMMISSIONS BUT IF WE INCLUDED IN OUR IN OUR COMMISSION IT WOULDN'T SERVE THE PURPOSE OF WHAT WE HAD. WHAT WE NEEDED SO THAT WAS MY PRIMARY TALKING POINT TODAY AND I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS BEING HERE AND I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT AND COMMITTEE AND WHAT? GIVE THAT SUPPORT BACK TO YEAR CONSTITUENTS TO GROW CANNABIS WHERE THEY NEED TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN I'M HERE PRIMARILY HERE FOR TECHNICAL ISSUES INTO A. ANSWER QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES TO COMMISSIONS BUT I WILL LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. THAT YOU WILL HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE COMMISSIONS CREATED FOR ANY ONE COMMODITY. THE WINE INDUSTRY IS PROBABLY THE BEST EXAMPLE THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS IN LAW DEALING WITH THE WINE INDUSTRY HOW COUPLE OF THEM ARE MADE MAYES MAINLY FOR GEOGRAPHICAL REASONS. THE MENDOCINO ONE GREAT COMMISSION ALONE I WOULD BRIDGE ONE GREAT COMMISSION THE BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THREE COMMISSIONS WERE CREATED IN ONE YEAR. TWO OF THEM IN ONE BILL. PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY WAS LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND TO TRY TO FIND THE BEST FIT FOR THE INDUSTRY SO YOU HAD THE CALIFORNIA WINE GRAPE COMMISSION YOU HAD THE WIND COMMISSION AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CALIFORNIA WINE AND WINE GREAT COMMISSION. ALL ALL DETERMINE. IN. DID TWO BILLS IN ONE YEAR SO THIS IS NOT UNIQUE TO HAVE AN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY OF THIS NATURE HAS DIFFERENT CULTURAL PRACTICES HAS DIFFERENT NEEDS FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY SEE. LOOK AT AND SEE TWO SEPARATE COMMISSIONS TO SERVE THEIR INTERESTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO PLEASE COME FORWARD IF YOU WOULD. AND IF YOU CAN JUST STATE YOUR NAME AND WHETHER YOU'RE IN SPORT OR NOT. MEXICO COLONUS AYE WITH KEISTER CONSULTING ON BEHALF OF FLOW KANA IN SUPPORT OF BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS TINA MARTIN WIDMANN MADE FARMS AND. I AM THE SON IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THINK YOU. MY NAME'S ANDY*FROM HUMBOLDT COUNTY WE'RE GONNA BLISS FARMS AND I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY NAME IS HAZEL BACK WELL I AM WITH THE EMERALD CUP AND WE ARE DEFINITELY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL HUNG Q.. MY NAME'S HEATHER BERG I'M A PARTNER WITH THE LAW FIRM OF GREENSPOON MARTYR AND NOT A CULTIVATOR BUT I DO SUPPORT CULTIVATORS. AND I AM STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. MY NAME IS HOLLY CARTER AND LIVING ROADWAY IN SOUTHERN HUMBOLDT CALIFORNIA AND I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE. HERTZBERG CONFLICTED OR NOT. AND SAW A MARIN SEEN AT WITH CAPITA STRATEGIES GROUP WHEN WE HAVE THE THAT KIND OF HIS BUSINESS ALLIANCE. AND OUT WHITE THAT MISTER THE VIENEN THE SPONSORS FOR INCLUSION IN THERE ARE COMMISSION AND THE BILL. AND WE WE COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THE INDUSTRY IS AND AND A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW AS WE TRY TO GET THIS. I REGULATORY SYSTEM UP PLACE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS GOING TO AT. MAKE IT IN THE LONG RUN SAW HOW WE APPRECIATE IT WE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER AND WE DO WANT TO SEE THE SMALL OUTDOOR FARMER SUCCEED. AND AS I MENTIONED TO YOU WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED DISPENSARIES WHAT COURT IN THEIR CULTIVATION AND WE WANT TO HAVE THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU SO. WHAT THAT MISTER RABIN'S COMMITMENT WE'VE REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH? MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF KHALIFA WERE BASED IN SAN JOSE WHETHER IT VERY LARGE CULTIVATION OPERATION THERE AND WERE JUST AWARDED A PERMIT IN MISTER SALAS DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF HANFORD. FOR CULTIVATION THERE AS WELL I'M WE DID INDICATE OUR OPPOSITION ON TO THE SINGLE COMMISSION IN OUR LETTER TO YOU AND O THE TO THE AUTHOR WITH HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM. I'M WE LOVE THE IDEA OF A COMMISSION WE THINK FOR THIS GROWING INDUSTRY A COMMISSION IS GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT. I'M STEP IN MAKING SURE THAT THIS AYE INDUSTRIES PROFESSIONAL LIES AND ULTIMATELY ONCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GETS THEIR ACT TOGETHER. BE ABLE TO MARKET OURSELVES OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE THINK THE IDEA OF A COMMISSION IS A GREAT IDEA I'M WE HAVE ADVOCATED FOR A SINGLE COMMISSION. WE ACTUALLY LIKE MISTER LEVINE'S IDEA OF TWO COMMISSIONS AND UNDERSTAND FROM MISTER BROWN'S INPUT THAT. WE WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TO DO THIS AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT ISSUES HARPER EACH OF THOSE. INDUSTRIES BUT THE ONE I ISSUE THAT COMBINES ON FOR EVERYBODY I'M IS THE ONE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PROFESSIONAL THAT WERE MARKETING THAT. THAT WE ARE MAKING THIS SITE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA AS STRONG AS WE POSSIBLY CAN SO WE WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION WITH THE AMENDMENTS MISTER LET ME JUST TALK ABOUT MOVE TO SUPPORT POSITION. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT THAT. HERE TO FOUR HAD AN OPPOSE POSITION BUT. IS RETHINKING IT OR YOU'RE STILL POST. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THAT OKAY AYE JASON RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA GROWERS ASSOCIATION WANT TO THANK THE SPONSORS FOR BRIEFING ORGANIZATION AT THAT LENGTH LAST WEEK. BUT WE HAVE MEMBERS WHO WHO VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE BILL WOULD ALSO MEMBERS WHO HAVE CONCERNS AND SO AS A RESULT THE ORGANIZATION IS OFFICIALLY NEUTRAL IN THE BILL WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION WITH THE OFF FROM THE SPONSORS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. VERY GOOD. QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR BY THE COMMISSION. COMMITTEE. THE SAUCE. THE GREATER CHAIRED I JUST THINK MISTER LEVINE FOR MEETING WITH EVERYBODY AND GOING THROUGH. GOING THROUGH ALL THAT THE FINER POINTS OF THAT THE LEGISLATION BUT. IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR JUST COMPLETELY UNDER YOUR DISCUSSION BUT. IS THERE A WAY TO MAYBE PUT THIS ITEM. ON THE HEARING FOR THE TWENTY FIFTH AS A VOTE ONLY SINCE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IT TODAY BUT MAYBE WITH SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS FLUSHED OUT FROM. FROM THE AUTHOR. THAT CAN BE REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS FOR THE NEXT HEARINGS THAT WE CAN JUST VOTE ON THAT. BECAUSE I'D FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE SEEING. EXACTLY WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE TO THE LEGISLATION. I'LL BUT YOU KNOW SINCE WE DID HEAR ABOUT IT TODAY PROFLIGATE JUST TO VOTE ONLY ON. HUNTER NEXT YEAR. SO I'M I'M TOLD THAT THIS IS BEEN DOUBLE REFERRED AND SO IT'S GOT TO GO TO BMP I. YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME BILL BUT TO NAMED COMMISSIONS. IT'S A VERY. THEN CRUCIFY. THE AUTHOR PERHAPS SOMEONE ELSE COULD. ARTICULATE FOR ME HOW OR WHEN WE LOOK AT IT AS FAR AS LICENSED. OUTDOOR CULTIVATORS. VERSES LICENSE INDOOR CULTIVATORS WHAT'S THE NUMBER RIGHT NOW. CALIFORNIA VERSUS UNLICENSED. I'M SORRY NEED YEAH YEAH I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO GO TO. THE NEW STATE AGENCY THAT. THAT'S I MEAN YOU MIGHT IF YOU DO KNOW THAT YOU'RE FREE TO GIVE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE HERE ACTUALLY HAS THAT NUMBER BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING NUMBER. YEAH I I DON'T THINK WE KNOW LICENSE VERSES UNLICENSED APPLES TIME. I DO KNOW THAT WE ARE EXPECTING. SUBSTANTIALLY MORE LICENSED OUTDOOR MIX LATE HERE ONE CULTIVATORS TO COME ONLINE IN HUMBLE COUNTY THEY DID JUST ISSUE AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED PERMITS. BUT. BEYOND THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO QUANTIFY THE NUMBER OF SAY UNLICENSED OPERATORS. IN THE STATE RIGHT AND IN ONE ONE THING THAT YOU KNOW IS WE'RE LOOKING AT DATA THAT DOES COME AND I THINK THAT THE REVENUES BELOW PROJECTIONS AND I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE BARRIER. TO A MEETING THE REGULATORY. STANDARDS THAT ARE ARE NECESSARY FOR THAT LICENSE SEEMED FOUR THEN. THE WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS TO THEN DISTRIBUTE AND SELL IT. AND DIE A LOT OF THEM ACTUALLY BUY. EXTRA. BEFORE JANUARY. TO TO MEET THE NEED THAT THEY HAD BECAUSE THEY HAD ANTICIPATED THE REGULATORY HURDLE BEING ONE THAT WAS SUBSTANTIAL. AND. THE HOPE IS FOR THESE COMMISSIONS TO. HELP. GROWERS FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES ARE AND HOW THE PROFESSIONAL LIES SO THAT WE CAN. YOU KNOW. HOW THE ONES THAT WERE IN DISMISSING CAN MEET THOSE REGULATIONS? BE LICENSED AN AND I THINK ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PIECES OF WHAT'S HAPPENING SPECIFICALLY WITH SOME GROUND FARMERS RIGHT NOW IS THERE FINING THAT THE. COST OF REGULATION IS SO HIGH THAT THEY'RE LOSING MONEY CURRENTLY. THEY'RE HOPING THAT THEY CAN. KIND OF MANAGE THE BLEEDING OF THE HEMORRHAGING OF FUNDS UNTIL THE MARKET BALANCES ITSELF OUT WE GOT ON ENOUGH RETELL ENTITIES ONLINE. BUT. WERE SUFFERING FROM FARMERS ACTUALLY DROPPING OUT OF THE REGULATED SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY. THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE COST ASSOCIATED TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL MARKETPLACE. SO WE MAY HAVE MISSED THAT THAT PART OF HER TESTIMONY WHICH I THOUGHT WAS EXCELLENT IN REGARDS TO THE DIFFERENCE IN THE REGULATORY BURDENS ON INDOOR AND OUTDOOR AND I THINK THAT THAT. AYE IT FRANKLY MY MY PITCH WAS GOING TO BE REALLY NEED TO GET GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND TRY TO WORK IT OUT. UP BECAUSE THAT IT MAKES IT STRONGER BUT I'M CONVINCED THAT THERE REALLY ARE DIFFERENT BURDENS ON ON. THE OUTDOOR AS OPPOSED TO THE INDOOR AND UP TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'VE GOT THE INDUSTRY SAYING LET'S DO TWO SEPARATE ONES UP I I I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM BECAUSE I THINK IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE FIVE WHICH YOU'RE GONNA BE SIX WERE TO GOING TO BE ADDING TO. THAT TO THE. TO THE BELT WHEN IT GOES TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING IT BACK IF IF IT CHANGES SUBSTANTIALLY AND WE DON'T LIKE WHAT IT WHAT IT SAYS BECAUSE. IT'S IT'S NOT WHAT WAS ARTICULATED HERE BUT MISTER JOHN SAWYER YOU YOU HAD A QUESTION. PATRICK KIND OF COMMENTED AND THAN I COULD HELP MR GREAT OF TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW MANY LEGAL AND ILLEGAL. I'M JUST GLAD WE MAPS THAT PUBLIC CAN HELP YOU LOOK AT. CULTIVATED SANTIAGO ON THEIR VERY EASILY SO AS AS ONE OF THE. THE FOUNDING FIVE OF MISTER BONTA. A COOLEY LACKEY WOOD AND MYSELF WERE THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY. ALLOWS FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS AND WANTS TO HELP WHICH SIXTY FOUR PROSECUTE FOR DAN DID DON'T USE WRITING OTHER. OF WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED. IN IT FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AND IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT. WE DON'T HAVE ENTITIES GOING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER HOW MADE IT REALLY IMPORTANT MISTER GRAY PROBABLY COULD ATTEST. TWO WHEN YOU HAVE AN INDUSTRY FIGHTING WITH ONE ANOTHER. HOW WE CAN INHIBIT? IT'S GROWTH OVER LONG PERIOD TIME OBVIOUS INDUSTRIES THAT THE INFANCY. TO HAVE A. IT THE HAVE THE FALLOUT AMONG FAMILY EARLY ON IS NOT HEALTHY IN IS NOT GOOD AND I. I WILL LAST THE AUTHOR. ON IF YOU ALLOW MYSELF IN IN ANY OF THE FOUND THE FIVE TWO TO ASSIST THAT. TRYING TO BRING US TOGETHER AND MY SUGGESTION TO BOTH SIDES INDOOR AN OUTSIDE. THAT YOU COME TOGETHER AND FIGURE IT OUT. THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS AND LEGISLATORS TO FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOU. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE THAT THAT DAD NAM. THAT'S SOLUTION I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR SENTENCES JONES SAWYER AND AND WHEN WE. HAVE STRUCK STRUCK THIS DEAL THIS COMPROMISE IF YOU WILL YOU KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS INDUSTRY IS REALLY GOING TO GO. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IN IN ITS INFANCY THAT WE CAN HELP THE. NON YOU KNOW SIGN ABOUT WHO MAKES THE BEST BROWNIES ARE ALSO BESTOWING HERE IT'S JUST A HOW DO WE MEET PROFESSIONAL REGULATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TO IN THIS CASE BE A FARMER. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL AND TODD AND LEGITIMATE AND LEGAL. AND WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN A FEW YEARS IF THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MERGE THOSE COMMISSIONS OR NOT. BUT I THINK IT'S TOO SOON FOR US TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT. YOU KNOW EVEN FOR US OLD TIMERS WE STILL WILL BE AROUND. UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S ALL I WOULD SAVE COMMISSIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR IT NOW ILLEGITIMACY OF THIS INDUSTRY. BUT FOR TRADING RULES AND REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS AND SO THAT ON EVERYBODY KNOW WOOD LAYING THERE IN. AND MORE IMPORTANT HOPEFULLY THEY CAN. BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO RESOLVE. EVEN CONFLICTS LIKE THIS ON THE IRONY OF IT IS WHAT WE'RE HAVING CONFLICTS ABOUT HOW TO CREATE A INDUSTRY AT COMMITTEE COMMISSION THAT COULD PULSE WE WILL. STOP A LOT OF THIS SO MISUNDERSTANDING AND SO I AM WILLING TO ROLL MY SLEEVE UP ON TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR IF YOU ALLOW ME ON TO BE HEAVILY INVOLVED IN IN THAT DISCUSSION JUSTICE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. AND THE OTHER FOUR FOUNDERS AND WE. WE HAVE A. IS A LOT OF MEMBERS WHO SAY WE HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE ON HOW THINGS MOVE FORWARD SO BE REAL IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE INVOLVED. THANK. THANK YOU MISTER GRAY. BOB THANK GOD THE AUTHOR AND MISTER JONES FOR. DIRECTED ME TO THE CORRECT INTERNET SITES TO. ANSWER MY QUESTIONS. BUT. I GUESS I AYE STILL YOU KNOW I I THINK DESCRIBING THE. THE CANNABIS MARKETS IN TO SEIZE THE CORRECT DESCRIPTION. I SEE SOME. TREMENDOUS HURDLES FRANKLY IN FRONT OF THE INDUSTRY. YOU KNOW IS THE CHAIR GOVERNMENTAL RESEARCH COMMITTEE IT WE'VE REGULATED ALCOHOL IN THE STATE. SINCE PROHIBITION AND THERE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED THERE SOME SIMILARITIES SOMETHINGS THAT ARE. A CLEARLY DIFFERENT A BUT I THINK WE'RE OFF TO A STUMBLING START. ALL SAY THAT. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH LICENSED WHETHER WE KNOW THE NUMBER WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER I THINK WE CAN ALL COLLECTIVELY AGREE. AND CERTAINLY THE INFORMATION I'VE SEEN. AND THE REPORTS WE'VE GOTTEN ARE THAT THAT THEIR SOME REAL A STUMBLING BLOCKS. IN GETTING ENOUGH LICENSE CULTIVATORS AND RETAILERS ETCETERA. GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THERE'S NOT A FUNCTIONAL MARKET AND IT JUST STRIKES ME GIVE ME A LITTLE PAUSE LITTLE PREMATURE TO BE MOVING FORWARD. WITH THIS KIND OF EFFORT. ALTHOUGH I'M SURE AT SOME POINT THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE. APPROPRIATE NECESSARY STEP DISLIKE SHIRTS TODAY AND. CAN ECHO MISTER SALSAS COMMENT SUMS NOT SURE I'M COMFORTABLE MOVE FORWARD TODAY. CERTAINLY WE'LL SEE. I DON'T SEE HOW IT GOES. THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER. YEAH. I'M WORDS COMMENT I MEAN IT'S KINDA INTERESTING SITTING HERE AS SOMEONE WHO IS A FARMER AND HAS BEEN PART OF A COMMISSION THE RIGHTS COMMISSION. AND IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT WORKS YOU KNOW. A LOT OF THIS JUST DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE TO ME FIRST OF ALL. WE MAY HAVE HAD SOME THE COMMISSION'S CREATED FOR GEOGRAPHIC PERSON PURPOSES BUT THIS WILL BE THE FIRST ONE THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT WE. MAKE A BASED ON HOW THE PRODUCT IS GROWN. NOT AWARE OF ANYONE THAT THAT SPLITS ABOUT. THAT WAY AND AS YOU COME INTO THE THE LEGAL MARKETPLACE THANK YOU BY THE WAY FOR COMING INTO THE THAT THE LEGAL MARKET GREAT NOT LEGAL MARKETPLACE. IS A COUPLE THINGS THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET INTRODUCED TO ONE AS COMPETITION. YEAH YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO COMPETE WITH PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW AND AND BASICALLY. IT IN A MARKETPLACE AND MAKE HIM MAKE YOUR PRODUCT YOU KNOW. IN A WAY THAT IS EFFICIENT AND THAT AND THAT YOU CAN GET A GOOD VALUE FOR YOUR PRODUCT. YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING HEY OURS ARE GROWN IN THIS CERTAIN WAY. AB NOT ORGANIC GROWERS ARE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T SEPARATE OUT THEIR COMMISSIONS. BUT THEY MARKET THEMSELVES AS ORGANIC THEY'RE ABLE TO GET BETTER VALUE FOR THEIR PRODUCT. EVEN THOUGH. THE COSTS MAY BE DIFFERENT. BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO GET MORE VALUE FOR THEIR PRODUCT THEY CAN COMPETE COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE SO. THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM SAYING UP A COMMISSION. YES THERE'S ALSO REGULATION WELCOME THE DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA IN A LEGAL WAY. THOSE OF US IN FARMING. HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS AND AS WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE. YOU KNOW YES THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT PRODUCTS GOING TO CALIFORNIA IS A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING GREAT THINGS NARROW BECAUSE WE HAVE A STRONG. AGRICULTURE SECTOR BUT IT'S. ITS FUTURE IS DEFINITELY NOT CERTAIN BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY CLIMATE. IN THE STATE THE MORE THAT WE KEEP HAVING YOU KNOW THESE BARRIERS AS YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE LOSING PEOPLE NOT EVIL ABLE TO FARM. WELCOME TO BE IN A FARMER IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S BUT AGAIN THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THE COMMISSION AND THEN A COMMISSION IS FORMED. LARGELY TO FOR THE GROWERS TO BAN TOGETHER AND PROMOTE THEIR PRODUCTS PROMOTE AND MARKET AND MARKET. THEIR PRODUCTS YES THERE'S ALSO YOU KNOW TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO. WORK THE REGULATORY BARRIERS ONE THAT I CAN THINK OF AND RICE WOULD BE THE. IRRIGATED LANDS PROGRAM AND KINDA COMING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THAT. BUT LARGELY IT'S ABOUT MARKETING AND SO. LET'S TAKE A LITTLE STEP BACK. THIS ISN'T AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. IN THE NORMAL WAY THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS ISN'T LIKE DRIED PLUMS AND MORE AND WALNUTS AND RICE. WE'RE STILL DO WHAT THE SCHEDULE ONE DRUG. LARGELY THIS IS THE END USE OF THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE SMOKED. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ALSO EDIBLES AND AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AS WELL BUT LARGE THAT'S WHAT IT IS. AND I WOULD JUST ASK THIS BODY LIKE. WHAT WOULD WE DON'T GROW TOBACCO IN CALIFORNIA? BUT IF WE DID WOULD YOU BE OKAY WITH THE A PROMOTIONAL. COMMISSION FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS. THE A WE'RE GONNA BAND TOGETHER AND PROMOTE THE USE OF OF TOBACCO I DON'T SEE TOO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE. WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN NOT AND AND TO ME THAT'S NOT THE APPROPRIATE. APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THIS THERE ARE HEALTH THERE ARE HEALTH ANOTHER. ISSUES ASSOCIATE WITH MARIJUANA ALL WE'VE DONE IN CALIFORNIA'S IT MADE IT LEGAL. FOR ADULTS. TO RECREATIONALLY USES. WE HAVEN'T NECESSARILY MADE THIS INTO AN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY. AND THEY TREATED IT THE SAME WAY AS AN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY AND I HONESTLY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD. SOLIDUS BACCHUS UP AND SAY IS THIS REALLY THE APPROPRIATE THING TO BE CREATING A MARKET OR MARKETING PROMOTIONAL. COMMISSION. FOR CALIFORNIA GROWN AND I'LL I'LL GIVE THE AUTHORS VERY CLEVERLY NAMED COMMISSION. SON GROWN YOU KNOW. MAKES IT SOUND LIKE GOMEZ IS LIKE A RAISINS OR SOMETHING RIGHT YEAH. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS I DON'T KNOW THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR A COMMISSION. TO BE FORMED. AND SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS TO THAT. THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE THIS INDUSTRY HASN'T REALLY GOTTEN OUT THERE. I MEAN IT'S VERY MUCH IN ITS INFANCY THERE'S LOT OF THINGS WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT SO TO CREATE A COMMISSION. AND THEN ALSO DID NOT ONLY THAT LET'S CREATE TWO COMMISSIONS. AND SPLIT THOSE UP IN A WAY WE NEVER HAVE BEFORE WHY SHOULD WE DO THAT. WHY SHOULD WE TREAT THIS SO MUCH DIFFERENTLY THAN WE'VE TREATED AS ANYTHING ELSE? AND SO YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY AT AND I THINK IT'S NOT READY THIS ISN'T FULLY COOKED. YOU KNOW SO MAYBE WE MAYBE WE SHOULD THE. YEAH I THINK I THINK TAKE A PAUSE ON THIS AYE I AM I WILL BE VOTING NO TODAY AND BUT I THINK THIS IS A LOT MORE TIME BEFORE WE JUST MOVE FOR SOME COMMISSION. THAT OBVIOUSLY STILL HAS A LOT OF ISSUES EVEN AMONGST ITS OWN. INDUSTRY A HAS A LOT OF ISSUES I I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE THIS DOWN TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I GUESS I LOOK AT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY NAM. THE VOTERS HAVE DECIDED THIS IS A LEGAL POT PRODUCT AND I LOOK AT IT VERY MUCH LIKE. WINE GRAPES IN. IT YOU DON'T YOU CAN YOU TURN IT INTO SOME SOMETHING THAT IF YOU OVER INDULGE. IT'S YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. AND. SO IN MANY WAYS TO FOR ME LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT THAT MY PITCH WAS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW YOU REALLY NEED TO GET. BOTH INDOOR OUTDOOR TOGETHER WORK TOGETHER AND AND SEE IF THERE'S LIKE A COMPROMISE. I SEE THAT THERE IS A COMPROMISE COMPROMISES THEY WANNA BE SEPARATE AND MAYBE AT SOME POINT THEY DO WORK TOGETHER AND IT BECOMES ONE COMMISSION BUT. YOU KNOW WHENEVER IT BUSINESS COMES FORWARD TO ME ESPECIALLY IN THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY AND SAYS LOOK WE WANT IS WE WANT TO CREATE A BOARD. ARE A COMMISSION AND WERE WILLING TO IT CHARGE OURSELVES. SO THAT WE CAN THEN GET INFORMATION DISSEMINATED AMONG OUR MEMBERS I HATE THAT I REALLY DON'T GET INVOLVED IN SAYING NO I I JUST DON'T THINK THAT. YOU DESERVE TO HAVE YOUR OWN BOARD AYE IT WE GET TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'VE. BLAST AGRICULTURAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. IF IF THEY COME FORWARD I KIND OF FEEL LIKE. THERE'S A THERE'S A PURPOSE AND THERE'S A REASON AND. FOR ME THIS IS. A SITUATION WHERE IT IT IS A IT IS A. IN IS IN ITS INFANCY. AND UP THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN AND A LOT TO KNOW IN ORDER TO STAY WITHIN THAT. THE LANES THAT THE STATE HAS SET UP IN ORDER FOR THIS. A INDUSTRY MOVE FORWARD AND THERE ARE A LOT THERE ARE A LOT OF REGULATIONS AND THERE'S A LOT OF REGULATIONS BECAUSE BECAUSE JUST LIKE ALCOHOL IT'S TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS. ANYTHING THAT IS. THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO. TO GET YOU. DRUNK HIGH OR. IMPAIRED IN A WAY THAT AFFECTS OTHER PEOPLE THERE'S REGULATION. AND SO I SEE THIS RIGHT RIGHT ALONG THE LINE WITH WITH EVERYTHING ELSE AND SO I I'M NOT OPPOSED TO HAVING IT GO FORWARD IN AND HAVING IT BE TWO SEPARATE COMMISSIONS. ON IF IN IN THAT PROCESS IT IT'S DECIDED THAT ONE WOULD BE BETTER I'M OKAY WITH THAT TOO BUT. BUT I'M WE THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I FALL ON IT TODAY AND I IF IF YOU'RE GOING STE SO THE WAY THAT THE PROCESS WORKS HERE AT THAT AT. AT OUR LEVEL IS IT IS THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ADDING. ANOTHER COMMISSION AND THAT'S. WE DON'T ALLOW AMENDMENTS AT. APPEAR BECAUSE IT IT'S. THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT'S DONE UP BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE HEARING OTHERWISE I WOULDA SAID LET'S PUT THIS OVER TO THE TWENTY FIFTH AND WE CAN COME BACK AND YOU CAN SHOW US THAT AMENDED LANGUAGE. IF YOU. IF YOU SAY THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA DO A WEEK EXPECT TO SEE THE BILL CHANGE THAT WAY AND I'M I'M OKAY WITH THAT. AS A COMMITTEE CHAIR AND AS I SAID WE ALWAYS HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING IT BACK AND AND TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT AGAIN IF IT. ENDS UP SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WOULD DO THAT. BUT I'M NOT SURE YOU EAT THERE'S THAT THERE'S ENOUGH OF SUPPORT HERE SO I THINK WE NEED TO FINISH KIND FINISHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. AND. I THINK I WAS ASKING FOR QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE MADE THEIR COMMENTS ALL I CHIU A CONCLUDE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LET GIVE YOU THE FINAL SAY. DEBT MEMBERS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTARY AND OF COURSE. YOU DID THE COMMITMENT IS IS THE ONE THAT I MADE THAT WE WOULD TAKE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE OF COURSE WE'D BE ABLE TO COME BACK IF THERE IS ANY. DISCREPANCY AND WHAT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY YOU AND THE COMMITTEE. THE CHOICE WE HAVE BEFORE US IS. TAKE YOU KNOW STRUCK THIS COMPROMISE AYE AND SUPPORT WHAT WE TALK ABOUT AS A NASCENT INDUSTRY OR IN INDUSTRY IN ITS INFANCY BUT. LET'S REMEMBER THAT THIS IN FACT. IS NOT A CRAWLING BABY. THIS IS NOT AN INDUSTRY IN INFANCY THIS IS OF OUR A A MARKET THAT HAS BEEN. OPERATING. YOU KNOW. IN AN UNREGULATED I AND ILLEGAL FASHION FOR DECADES IN CALIFORNIA IT IS A BIG INDUSTRY. HUGE IMPACT ON OUR STATE HUGE IMPACT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND VOTERS HAVE DECIDED THAT WE WANT TO REGULATE IT THAT IT WILL BE LEGAL. AND WE HAVE AN OPTION HERE WE HAVE A GROWERS WHO WANT TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROFESSIONAL EYES. AND LEGITIMIZING LEGALIZE THEIR OPERATIONS TO THE STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE SAT. OR. HAVE THEM UNABLE TO DO THAT AND PERHAPS CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN A WAY THAT HAS HAD NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. FOR THE ENVIRONMENT I OR OTHERWISE. I THINK THAT THIS IS A AN EASY CHOICE TO MAKE. WE WE WANT TO GO AHEAD WITH THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AND ALLOW THEM. PROFESSIONAL LIES AND LEGALIZE AND AND RUN AS PROFESSIONAL OPERATIONS AND ALSO RECOGNIZE THE VERY DIFFERENT REGULATIONS THAT ARE GROWERS FOLLOW AND RESPECT THAT. I ENHANCE THE COMPROMISE THAT WAS STRUCK BY ALL OF THE GROWERS THAT WERE REPRESENTED TODAY THANK YOU ASKED WHEN I GO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO GALLAGHER TO PUT TWO QUICK QUESTIONS TO LOUIE BECAUSE I KNOW HE'S YOU KNOW HAS THE EXPERTISE IN THIS I MEAN. ARE THESE PRIVATE COMMISSIONS ARE PRIMARILY FORMED FOR MARKETING AND PROMOTION OF THE PRODUCT IT THAT'S MY ANDERSON AND ISN'T THAT WHAT AND I GUESS THE SECOND QUESTION ISN'T THAT WHAT. THIS COMMISSION WOULD DO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PROFESSIONALIZATION REGULATORY COMPLIANCE I MEAN. IN THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T THIS ALSO PERMIT THE PROMOTION AND MARKETING. OF THAT PRODUCT. AND CHAIR OF YOU MAKE ME PRETTY. A. SO. THESE THESE ENTITIES THESE BOARDS THESE COMMISSIONS WERE CREATED OR AUTHORIZED UNDER THE NIGHT THE MARKING ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN. AND WITHOUT A DOUBT HUB. IN THOSE DAYS IN AND AS RECENTLY IS YOU KNOW THIRTY FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN WE STARTED TRADING COMMISSIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL CLIENTS IT WAS ABOUT MARKETING. BUT THAT'S CHANGED. AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE THAN ONE COMMISSION C. E. O. THESE DAYS SAY WERE NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF ASKING CONSUMERS THE MORE OF OUR STUFF. THAT'S BEING DONE. IT'S BEING DONE ON A ON A GLOBAL SCALE IT'S BEING DONE BY NATIONAL CHECKOFF PROGRAMS IT'S BEING DONE IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS. MORE PROGRAMS TODAY. LAST YEAR THE SEE THE SPINY LOBSTER COMMISSION WAS CREATED NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT MARKETING SPINY LOBSTERS BECAUSE THAT INDUSTRY FOUND A NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND UNIFIED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SUSTAIN THEMSELVES. SO. YES THERE IS LANGUAGE IN HERE BOILERPLATE LANGUAGE LIKE YOU SEE IN MOST COMMISSIONS DEALING WITH THE PROMOTION OF THE PRODUCT. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT MOST COMMISSIONS TODAY HAVE TRANSITION AWAY FROM THE MARKETING ANY MORE STUFF. TWO LET'S DO RESEARCH. LET'S DO BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES LET'S OVERSEE REGULATORY PROGRAMS YOU MENTION THE RICE PROGRAM YOUR DATA LANCE PROGRAM IS NOT THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT THE RICE OVERSEAS IT ALSO. HAS A A PESTICIDE CALLED THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM A WATER QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAMS AND WE START TO SEE BECAUSE. THESE PROGRAMS CAN. CAN OVERSEE AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT REGULATORY AUTHORITY IN REGULATORY OVERSIGHT SO. I BELIEVE THAT. THE COULD THIS COMMISSION. WHILE IT HAS THAT LANGUAGE IN THEIR THE BOILERPLATE LANGUAGE IT YOU SEE. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF A SON GROWN CANNABIS COMMISSION OR EVEN AN INDOOR CANCER CAMPUS COMMISSION IS NOT GOING TO BE ABOUT THE MARKETING. I THINK THERE'S VENTURE CAPITALIST ALL OVER THE STATE THAT ARE GONNA MARKET CANNABIS THE WAY THEY WANT AND THAT'S WHAT THE DISPENSARIES DO. WHEN I WAS FIRST APPROACH IN OUR FIRM WAS FIRST APPROACHED AND AND. HELD MEETINGS IN THE EMERALD TRIANGLE ON THIS WHAT WE HEARD WAS WE NEED A VEHICLE TO HELP US SUSTAIN. WE NEED A VEHICLE TO TO WALK US THROUGH AND GUIDE US THROUGH THE REGULATORY A PROCESS THESE THAT WE'RE NOW DEALING WITH WE NEED RESEARCH WE NEED BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WE NEED A COHESIVE VOICE SO THAT WE CAN DO THAT SO. I COMMISSION THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT IT IS WHEN A GROUP OF PRODUCERS COME TO YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE COMMISSION CAN DO WHATEVER THEY LIKE WHATEVER BEST FITS THEIR NEEDS. WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE'S THE CALIFORNIA NAVEL ORANGE COMMISSION CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR NAVEL ORANGES NOT CITRUS NAVEL ORANGES THERE'S THE CALIFORNIA ICEBERG LETTUCE COMMISSION. NOT FOR ALL LET US JUST FOR ICEBERGS YOU GOT THE TABLE GREAT COMMISSION ON ONE SIDE AND THE WINE GRAPE COMMISSION ON THE OTHER. SO AGAIN. WHAT STATE LAW HAS PROVIDED THEM WITH THE MARKETING ACTINIDE TEAM THIRTY SEVEN PROVIDES IS THIS OPPORTUNITY? FOR PRODUCERS TO COME TOGETHER SAY WE WANT TO ASSESS OURSELVES FOR THE PURPOSES OF CREATING A COLLECTIVE VOICE. AND. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS COMMISSION IS DOING. THE NEXT COMMISSION THAT WE'RE GONNA RIGHT INTO THIS BILL WILL DO AND THAT'S KIND OF FOLLOW IN THE TRADITION OF THESE THESE LAWS OVER THE LAST FORTY PLUS YEARS. WELL IF I COULD JUST RESPOND AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT LOUIS OF THE RESPECTFULLY AT THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DISINGENUOUS BECAUSE YES SIR YES THERE ARE REGULATORY COMPONENTS THIS AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND PROGRAM. BUT PRIMARILY THEY ARE PROMOTING I CAN. WE DRIVE EACH YOU DRIVE INTO THE SACRAMENTO ON ON THE RADIO IS PLAYING. A CALIFORNIA RICE COMMERCIAL ON ARMSTRONG THE GETTY WRITE Y. TO PROMOTE CALIFORNIA RICE IN WHAT IS DOING AND TO AND TO PROMOTE PROMOTE THAT INDUSTRY. SO THAT THAT THE QUESTION HERE BEFORE IS THAT IS THAT WE WANT FOR THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY DO YOU WANT TO PROMOTE THIS PRODUCT YOU BROUGHT UP ALL THOSE DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS. THOSE ARE ALL SEPARATE COMMODITIES THEY ARE SEPARATE COMMODITIES. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TABLE GRAPES AND WINE GRAPES AS IT IS THERE'S THEY ARE DIFFERENT COMMODITIES THAT ARE BEING PROMOTED SO AGAIN. THAT DOES THAT'S NOT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME EXACTPRODUCT WE'RE GOING TO CREATE TWO DIFFERENT YEAH BECAUSE IT CALDERON I THINK I THINK MISTER BROWN WILL OFTEN DETERMINE THEY DO CAN ATTEMPTING TO ANSWER YOU ARE FINISHED MISTER LEVINE AND THEN YOU CAN RESPOND. FILTERED I JUST GOT WHERE I JUST POINT OUT IS THE FACT THOSE ARE DIFFERENT COMMODITIES MAYBE I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT WE KNOW. TALK HERE THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT DIFFERENCE IN AGRICULTURE BUT THAT'S THE TRUTH THEY ARE DIFFERENT COMMODITIES IN THEIR PROMOTING THAT PRODUCT. THAT THAT COME INTO THE QUESTION FOR THIS BODY IS IS THAT THE SAME THING THAT WE WANT TO DO HERE WHAT WE PROMOTE TOBACCO IF IT WAS GOING TO CALIFORNIA. WE PROMOTE THAT PRODUCT IN THEIR CULTURAL PRODUCT SO SO WHAT WE'VE HEARD POINT THAT YOU'VE MADE IT BACK IN MY HEAD WERE WHERE WHERE WERE GOING. A LITTLE BIT OFF SO I APPRECIATE THAT THAT THE DIALOGUE WILL EVERYBODY WILL GO GET A BEER TONIGHT WON'T FINISH SHOT THAT DISCUSSION BUT NOW WE HAVE THE BUSINESS OF THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE TO DO AND WE'VE SPENT ALMOST AN HOUR ON THIS ONE WITH THAT A LOT MORE. TO GO SO I MISS EGGMAN JUDGES RULED BROUGHT WITH IT AND I WAS RAISING MY HIM FOR A OF ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS. JUMPED AND. IT'S BECAUSE BY IS MICHAEL. MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE JUST AROUND AND AGAIN I ALSO LOOKED THE PORTALS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE BUT DO WE KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH ARE MY TWO COMMISSIONS NOW NOT JUST THE NUMBER ALONG WITH TO. AND IT TWO SEPARATE THAT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND THEN IS THERE A IS THERE A MARKET SHARE OF THE SUN GROWN VERSES. IN HOPE IN IN YOU KNOW NOT NOT SOME GROWN. UP AND. AND IS THERE. THAT. AND AND THEM AND THEN MORE TALK MUCH SUSTAINABILITY. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT WATER AND AND I KNOW ACTUAL FARMERS ARE MEAN. SON SOME FARMERS HAVE TO DO ABOVE WATCH SUITABILITY PLAN EVERYTHING AND I DON'T THINK. HYDROPONIC FARMERS ARE HELD TO THAT SAME STANDARD BECAUSE IT NOT ON ON THE GROUND WATER AS I UNDERSTAND IT. BUT. BUT OUR IS YOU CAN BE SOME ATTENTION PAID TO THE MARKET SHARE IT IS IT EQUAL NOW WILL THE GOAL BEFORE TIP TO REMAIN EQUAL AND IS THERE ANY. YEAH. YES YOU MAKE. AND TO THE QUESTION I THINK AND THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON FED HAVE. SO I'M CURRENTLY MARKET SHARE IS GREAT TENNIS SKEWED ON BOTH SIDES RATE SO IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A FLOWER MARKET FOR INHALABLE. ON CONSUMPTION THE MARKET SHARE IS ROUGHLY EIGHTY PLUS PERCENT INDOOR IN THE MARKETPLACE VERSES ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OR SO FOR A SON GROWN IN THE MARKETPLACE. HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INTO SAY MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS. A LOT OF THOSE MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS ARE BEING. PRODUCED USING SON GROWN PRODUCTS ON LARGELY BECAUSE WE. WELL SOME GRIM PRODUCTS TEND TO TESS CLEANER WE HAVE LESS PESTICIDE USE BECAUSE WHERE I'M A LITTLE MORE BALANCED WITH BUT OFFICIALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT. ANYTHING THERE IS A SECOND PART TO YOUR QUESTION MY APOLOGY I WILL USE MARKET SHARE WILL THERE BE ANY LIKE THAT ATTEMPT OR TRACKING TO SEE OF THAT BALLOT STAYS IN. IF IT STAYS IN THE SAME ROOM THAT IS THAT ANY KIND OF GOAL. I MEAN I THINK IT WOULD BE FABULOUS AND ONCE IN A COMMISSION IS A STYLISH TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER THE REPORTS THAT SHOW WHAT WAS PRODUCED BY REGION AND WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE IN THE MARKETPLACE HOA WAS UTILIZED. I THINK WERE A WAYS DOWN THE ROAD FROM THAT. SUNBURN FARMERS OF COURSE WOULD LOVE TO SEE A BALANCE IN THE MARKETPLACE IN THE MARKET SHARE BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE FOUNDING FATHERS HERE AS WELL AS. MERCER HOUSE VERY RIGOROUS AND RIGID. REGULATIONS AROUND ADVERTISING SO WHERE BASICALLY BOUNDED BY PRETTY LIMITED ADVERTISING OPPORTUNITIES. OKAY. A AND APPRECIATE THAT AND ALWAYS APPRECIATE THE FOUNDING FATHERS XIN. MANSE PLAINNESS UP AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE WE MARKET LINE A LOT AND IT'S A SIMCHA QUANTITY. SO ON THAT CONCLUDES THAT THE HEARING PART OF IT I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION IF SOMEONE IS WILLING TO MAKE THE MOTION. FOUNDING FIVE I MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL. MOTIONS BEEN MADE AND SECONDED. THE ROLE PLEASE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMEY ARE OUT BY OF THE ORAL AYE MATHIS. MATHIS NOT VOTING ADHERE CURRY FLORA. FLORA AYE GALLAGHER. THOSE.

WILL MOVE ON TO MISTER LEVINE SECOND BILL WHICH IS AB THIRTY TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO BEGIN MY PRESENTATION. ON AB THIRTY TWENTY ONE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY JOINT AUTHORS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SOLACE AND SOME MEMBER MEDINA WHO. I THINK WITHOUT THEIR PARTNERSHIP. THIS BILL WOULD BE A MUCH WEAKER ONE THAT WOULD NOT REPRESENT TAP THE ABLE TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA AND DIE IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO PARTNER WITH DOWN. TO MAKE SURE THIS BILL GETS ACROSS THAT THE FINISH LINE OR AT LEAST GETS TO HEAR AYE DEPENDING ON THE QUESTIONS THAT MR GALLAGHER MAY HAVE. SO THANK YOU AGAIN I OF FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT A. B. THIRTY TWENTY ONE WHICH REQUIRES KEACH FREE HAND HOUSING. FOR ALL EGG LAYING HENS RAISED OR HIS EGGS ARE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. AND ANIMAL WELFARE ADVOCATES ARE DEMANDING CAGE FREE PRODUCTION FOR EGGS HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE NATION MOST NEW AT PRODUCTION THAT IS BEING BUILT IS EITHER CAGE FREE. OR ABLE TO BE CONVERTED CAGE FREE WITH LITTLE ADDITIONAL EFFORT OR COSTS TEN MILES THAT IMPACTS ON MARKETS AND CONSUMERS THIS BILL INCORPORATES A STEP REQUIRING EACH TEND TO HAVE. ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR SQUIRREL SQUARE INCHES IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN THE CONVERSION TO CAGE FREE BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THIS ALLOWS THE HANDS TO BE REYES WITH MORE SPACE. AND THE CONVERSIONS THAT REQUIRE TIME AND PERMITS TO COME IN OVER THE PHASE IN PERIOD. THE BILL INCORPORATES NATIONAL CAGE FREE STANDARDS IN THE CALIFORNIA LAW AND SAGER'S THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HAND HOUSING REQUIREMENTS TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON CONSUMERS. AND THE NATIONWIDE INDUSTRY. THE LEGISLATION RETAINS CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP IN ANIMAL WELFARE AND MEETS EXPECTATIONS OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THAT THEY ARE PURCHASING EGGS RAISED CAGE FREE. AND TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF ANIMAL CARE FRESHNESS AND FOOD SAFETY. WITH ME TODAY IS DENNIS ALBION WHO REPRESENTS SEVERAL SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU LIKE THAT. DOUG TURNED OVER A MOMENTARILY TO STEVE GAP EARLY WHO IS A FARMER HERE IN THE CENTRAL AND EGG FARMER IN CENTRAL VALLEY. FOR SOME COMMENTS ON THE THE BILL. HELLO MY NAME IS STEVEN CAREFULLY PRESIDENT OF DON'T BELIEVE FAMILY FARMS. MY COMPANY FARMS BOTH ALMONDS AND EGGS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE PRODUCE NUMEROUS VARIETIES OF AIDS INCLUDING ORGANIC EGGS AND RICH DAY EXAM QE TREE EGGS. I AM CURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF A STAFF THAT IS THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA EGG FARMERS. A STAFF DOES NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BILL. BUT WE WERE REQUESTED BY THE AUTHOR TO ATTEND TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT ON THE MEASURE. AS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS MANY OF THE KEY RETAILERS GROCERS AND FOOD SERVICE ENTITIES ARE CONVERTING TO STARVING OR SELLING ONLY CAGE FREE EGGS. IN FACT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE ENTITIES THAT SELL EGGS ARE EIGHT PRODUCTS HAVE COMMITTED TO CONVERT TO CAGE FREE EGGS ONLY. ADDITIONALLY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HANDS WITH LESS STRESS AND MORE LIVING SPACE ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE CARRIERS OF SALMONELLA. MANY EGG FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE CURRENTLY CONVERTING ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR OPERATIONS TO CAGE FREE. IN ORDER TO SERVE THIS DEMAND AND ARE PROVIDING MORE LIVING SPACE FOR ANIMAL WELFARE AND FOOD SAFETY PURPOSES. IN FACT MY FAMILY FARM HAS COMMITTED TO BE QUE TREE BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE. THE BILL REFERENCES AN INDUSTRY STANDARD OF THE U. EP TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CAGE FREE STANDARDS. THIS WILL HELP ALL THE NATION'S AID FARMERS MEET A DEFINED QUE TREE REQUIREMENT. CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE NATION'S CAGE FREE MARKETS. THIS BILL PROVIDES NEARLY SIX YEARS UNTIL ALL FARMS IN CALIFORNIA AND THOSE IN THE NATION THAT SERVE CALIFORNIA. WILL NEED TO MEET QUE TREE STANDARDS. THIS TIME IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE NATION'S AID FARMERS TIME TO GET PERMITS. LAND YOU USE APPROVAL. OBTAIN CAPITAL AND FILLED OUT BROODING AND LAYING FACILITIES. THIS CONVERSION WILL BE A MONUMENTAL TASK IN IS ESTIMATED COST THE INDUSTRY APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO MEET THE STANDARD FOR ALL SALES IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION THIS TIMELINE IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE ENTITIES THAT HAVE COMMITTED TO A CONVERSION TO USING OR SELLING ONLY CAGE FREE EGGS. HOWEVER TO ENCOURAGE A SMOOTH TRANSITION THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES A STEP UP IN ENCLOSURE SIZE PROVIDING ALL HANDS AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SQUARE INCHES. REGARDLESS OF HOUSING SYSTEM BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. THIS ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CRITICS BY REQUIRING THE HUNDRED FOURTY FOUR INCH SPACE REQUIREMENT PER BIRD IN JUST TWO YEARS. THAT'S PROVIDING EACH HEN WITH NEARLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT MORE SPACE THAN THE CURRENT PROPOSITION TWO SPACE REQUIREMENTS. AND MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SPACE REQUIREMENTS FOR. VERSES NONCOMPLIANT QUE JADE'S. THE BILL IS NARROWLY CRAFTED DESIGNED TO PROVIDE PROPER APPROPRIATE TIME FOR COMPLIANCE FOR THE NATION'S AEG FARMERS. AND WILL INTEGRATE INTO CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING FOOD SAFETY ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS FUNDED THROUGH AN INDUSTRY ASSESSMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN DENNIS ALBION AND YOU HAVE A CALIFORNIA GRAIN FEED ON THE PACIFIC COAST RENDERING ASSOCIATION. GRAIN TO FEED PROVIDES LIVESTOCK NUTRIENTS GRAIN AND MICRONUTRIENTS THAT CALIFORNIA'S LIVESTOCK INDUSTRIES INCLUDING THE POULTRY. INDUSTRY ALSO THE HORSE AND PET FOOD. WELL. RENDERING PROVIDES ESSENTIAL SERVICES THE DEAL WITH ANIMALS AND POULTRY CARCASSES. BOTH THE STROKES ASSOCIATION STRIVE FOR A STRONG LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY AND TO ASSIST AND PROVIDE A SAFE WHOLESOME OUR PRODUCT. WE SUPPORT THREE THIRTY TWENTY ONE IS IT IS TAILORED TO ADDRESS INDUSTRY TRENDS CONSUMER DEMANDS AND FOOD SAFETY. I CALAVERAS CONSUMERS ARE INCREASINGLY DEMANDING CAGE FREE A. AND THE AND SO OUR RETAIL PARTNERS. NATIONAL CAGE FREE STANDARDS ARE IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL SO THAT AGAIN EVERYBODY KNOWS THE RULES. THERE IDENTIFIED AND ITS NATIONWIDE AND COMPLIANT WITH THE EXISTING INDUSTRY STANDARDS. THERE'S A SIX YEAR IMPLEMENTATION THE SUPERVISOR AS MR GET BELIEVE DISCUSSED THE REQUIREMENT TO MEET OUR TO BUILD OUT. TO GET PERMITS TO GET CAPITAL TO. PAY FOR THESE CONVERSIONS AND FRANKLY OF IT ACTUALLY. EVERY HAND DOES NOT LAY AN EGG UNTIL SHE'S. BUT AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OLD SO YOU ON HANDS ON JANUARY FIRST OF THE YEAR. YOU BETTER HAVE THEM BORN AND IN THEIR IN PLACE BY BASICALLY JUNE THIRTIETH OR. YOU KNOW THEY'RE DOING THEIR CYCLE. THAT THE BILL AS YOU DISCUSSED ALSO PROVIDES A STEP UP WITH THE THE THE SIZE REQUIREMENTS AND THEN. YOU BUILD TO THE TO THE CAGE REQUIREMENT A CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS A CAGE FREE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT WAY THERE'S A STEP UP THAT'LL EASE THE CONSUMER. SITUATION AND ALSO ALLOW FOR. MORE SMOOTH TRANSITION. TODAY WE MIGHT HEAR FROM SOME OPPONENTS AND KIND OF FORCE VERSURI. WE MAY DISCUSS THAT THERE'S BEEN AN INITIATIVE THAT HAVE BEEN FILED. THE. THE IN THIS BILL DEALS WITH EGGS THAT INITIATIVE IS FAR BROADER. AND I DON'T THINK ANYTHING. WOULD STOP THE FOLKS FROM GETTING A ASSEMBLY MEMBER SENATOR LEGISLATOR TO INTRODUCE A BILL TO COVER THE OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT'S THEIR CHOICE WE JUST FOCUSED ON. A MAJOR CALIFORNIA COMMODITY THAT'S ALSO A MAJOR NATIONWIDE COMMODITY. AND THEN UP FINALLY THIS WOULD BE. TIED TO BE ENFORCEMENT THE ENFORCEMENT IS A KEY ELEMENT HERE THAT THERE IS AN INDUSTRY FUNDED PROGRAMS CDFA THAT THAT MANAGES THE FOOD SAFETY AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS. OF THE OTHER COMMODITIES DON'T HAVE ANY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. ACCORDING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THAT WOULD REQUIRE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT SO THOSE ARE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT THE DIFFERENCES AND. OF THE REASON THAT CALIFORNIA GREENFIELD PACIFICUS READING ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS A SPECIAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ALEX FELONIES FELONIES GROUP ON BEHALF OF VOICE FOR CHOICE ADVOCACY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WELL YOU KNOW FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF BILL. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SO TWO OF YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK AND THEN IF YOU COULD JUST DO THE IDENTIFICATIONS AFTER THAT WOULD BE GREAT. HER THINK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU MY NAME IS CRYSTAL MARLON FROM THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES. AND I THINK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF EP THIRTY TWENTY ONE. AT THE ON SITE IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EP THIRTY TWENTY ONE. IS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO AMEND PROPOSITION TWO. IT'S PAST IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO AMEND THE INITIATIVE. UNLESS THE INITIATIVE GRANTS THE LEGISLATURE TO DO SO. AB THIRTY TWENTY ONE AMENDS PROP TWO BY REDEFINING THE AMOUNT OF SPACE. THAT FARMS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE HAGGLING HENCE A SUBJECT AT THE VERY HEART OF PROP TWO. OUR NEW BALLOT MEASURE KNOWN AS THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO FARMED ANIMALS ACT. IS A WAY TO PROPERLY AMEND PROP TWO. LEADING NATIONAL AND STATE ANIMAL PROTECTION FOOD SAFETY AND CONSUMER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIA VETERINARIANS ARE IN SUPPORT. TO PRESENT A CAGE FREE FUTURE FOR EGG LAYING HENS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH IS THIRTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PASS OF PROP TWO. AND IT'S EVIDENT THOUGHTS I AM SOME OF THE MOTIVATING FACTORS HERE. ARE ARE THOSE IN THE AG INDUSTRY THAT ARE PUSHING AB TWENTY ONE IS BECAUSE OF OUR BALLOT INITIATIVE. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE'VE ALREADY GATHERED ENOUGH SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY THIS MEASURE FOR THE BALLOT. IN FACT WERE LIKELY TO SMELL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MORE SIGNATURES TO GET OUR MESSAGE ON THE BALLOT. INITIAL POLLING SHOWS THAT THE BALLOT MEASURE IS IN SUPPORT BY STAGGERING SEVENTY TWO PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS. SIMPLY PUT CALIFORNIANS EXPECT MORE HUMANE TREATMENT OF FARM ANIMALS FOR SAFER FOOD SUPPLY SYSTEMS. THEY NO LONGER WANT TO SEE PRODUCERS USING MISTER ACTION AND DECEPTION TO CLING ON TO CRAWL CAGES. ARE BALLOT MEASURE COALITION STAND STRUGGLING IN OPPOSITION OF THIS EFFORT TO UNDERCUT OUR INITIATIVE. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE LEGISLATORS TO VOTE NO ON THIS LAST AND HADN'T TO MAINTAIN A STOCK STATUS QUO. THAT HAS LONG BEEN REJECTED BY VOTERS THINK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR OF MY NAME IS BRADLEY MILLER AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE HUMANE FARMING ASSOCIATION. THINK IT'S POOR IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE IN CONTEXT I CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN LOUD AND CLEAR. NOT SIMPLY FOR CAGE FREE BUT FOR CAGE FREE. BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. NOW ABOUT WHAT IS NOT COVERED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS THE FACT THAT MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE AND TWO THE BALLOT MEASURE. IS THE FACT THAT BOTH OF THEM FAILED TO COMPLY WITH PROPOSITION TWO. THE AMOUNT OF SPACE THAT CALIFORNIA HANDS WILL RECEIVE MORE THAN THEY ARE GETTING RIGHT NOW IS PRECISELY THIS AMOUNT OF SPACE. NOW THIS HAS BEEN A VERY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE AND IT WAS AT THE TIME OF PROPOSITION TWO BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. BOTH THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS OF PROP TWO AGREED ON. WAS A CALIFORNIA WOULD BE CAGE FREE BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. AND THAT SPATIAL REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THAT HANDS TO SPREAD BOTH WINGS FULLY WITHOUT ENCROACHING AIR TOUCHING THE SIDES OF THE CAGE OR THEIR HANDS. AND WHILE. THE PROPONENTS FAILED TO SPECIFY AS WELL THEY SHOULD HAVE. INTO THERE WAS COMMONALITY IN AGREEMENT THAT THAT WOULD NEVER BE LESS THAN A FOOT AND A HALF. PER HAN. IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE. TO COMPLY WITH PROPOSITION TWO EITHER THROUGH THE BALLOT MEASURE OR THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION BY PROVIDING ONLY ONE SQUARE FOOT. OF PER BIRD. AND THERE'S NO LOGIC TO ONLY PROVIDING THEM THAT THAT YOU WILL LOOK INTO LEGISLATION THEY BREAK IT DOWN THEY SAY WELL HANDS THAT ARE IN CERTAIN UNITS WILL. SUPPOSED TO GET ONE AND A HALF SQUARE FEET. BUT THEN IF YOU HAVE THE SAME UNIT. AND YOU THROW IN ANOTHER LEVEL. YOU CAN CRAM THIRTY THREE PERCENT MORE HANDS NOT ONLY ON THAT ADDITIONAL LEVEL THAT YOU ADD. BUT ON ALL THE ANIMALS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND AS WELL. THERE'S NO HUMAN HEALTH RATIONALE FOR THAT IN FACT INCREASE STOCKING DENSITIES INCREASES A SEMINAR PROBLEMS THAT WERE THE MOTIVATION. FOR A LOT OF THESE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE THE MOTIVATION STATED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. SO OF THEM THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO AND THE ONLY CONSTITUTIONAL THING WE BELIEVE AFTER CALIFORNIA OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED A BAN ON CAGES AND A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF KATE SPACE AT ONE POINT. A FIVE OF. A TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN SQUARE INCHES PER PER HAND. IS TO. SIMPLY DECLARE THAT CALIFORNIA AT CAGES ARE ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA AS OF NOW HOUSE OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPONENTS OF THE BALLOT MEASURE AND THE PROPONENTS OF THIS LEGISLATION. IS THAT ONE SAYS WELL LET'S IGNORE PROPOSITION TWO FOR A PERIOD OF SEVEN YEARS AFTER IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ENACTED. AND THERE'S ANOTHER PROPOSAL THAT SAYS NO THAT'S ACTUALLY IGNORE IT. UNTIL THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FOUR. A BOTH ARE HOLDING INC INAPPROPRIATE IT FLIES IN THE FACE OF A MATTER THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DECIDED BY CALIFORNIA VOTERS THEY DIDN'T GO TO THE POLLS AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN SAY. YES WE WANT TO GIVE LAYING HENS IN CALIFORNIA ONE SQUARE FOOT. AND WE WANT THEM OUT OF CAGES IN THE YEAR CAGE FREE. TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN ENACTMENT DATE AND THERE IS NO LEGITIMATE REASON FOR FOR GOING AGAINST THAT. I URGE YOU KNOW VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NAME IS DOCTOR SIR SHIELDS AND I'M THE BEHAVIOR AND OFFER SPECIALIST FOR HUMANE SOCIETY INTERNATIONAL. I'M I DID FIND TODAY FROM NEBRASKA IF IT'S OKAY I'D LIKE TO SAY JUST A FEW WORDS I LIKE TO DO THAT. APPRECIATE YOU FLYING AND YEAH. I'VE I DID MY DOCTOR WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS AND. I WILL BE BRIEF AND AS YOU KNOW THE CONFINEMENT OF FARM ANIMALS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSUMERS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO AND THE ANIMALS OF COURSE. AN INTENSIVE ANIMAL PROTECT PRODUCTION IS THERE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF IT THAT WE KNOW ARE DETRIMENTAL TO WELFARE AND. THERE'S AS A CLEAR SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR THIS IT'S NOT JUST AN EMOTIONAL CONCERNS BASED ON SCIENCE. YOU KNOW THE CABS AND THE PIGS ARE CREATED INSTALLS THAT ARE BARELY LARGER THAN THEIR OWN BODIES THEY CANNOT EVEN TURN AROUND. AND LAYING HANDS ON THEIR KEPT IN SMALL WIRE CAGES THEY CAN'T EVEN SPREAD THEIR WINGS AND THESE SYSTEMS PREVENT THE EXPRESSION OF IMPORTANT NATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND THEY HAVE REAL PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES ON THE WELFARE OF THE ANIMALS. AND THAT AFFECTS THEIR HEALTH THAT AFFECTS THEIR WELL BEING FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THEY CAN'T MOVE THEY CAN GET JOINT DAMAGE REDUCED MUSCLE WEIGHT AND SKELETAL WEAKNESS. PIGS NEED SEPARATE AREAS FOR FEEDING AND FOR ARRESTING YOUNG CABS M. THEIR VERY SOCIAL ENERGETIC ANIMALS IF THEY'RE TOOK A TETHERED IN A CRATE. THEN. THEY CAN ENGAGE IN NORMAL SOCIAL BEHAVIOR SO YOU'RE EVEN IF NO ONE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND I'M SURE YOU DO BUT EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE WELFARE OF THE ANIMALS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS CARE ABOUT VERY MUCH. AB THIRTY TWENTY ONE IS POISED TO UNDERMINE. ARE MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO TRY TO BRING THESE ISSUES BACK TO THE PEOPLE AND IT INCLUDES OUR BALLOT INITIATIVE COULD INCLUDES PIGS AND CABS AS WELL. AND FORMER SEVERITY HAD MANY YEARS TO COMPLY AND BUT AB THIRTY TWENTY ONE DELAYS THAT IMPLEMENTATION DATE EVEN FURTHER BY TWO FULL YEARS AND SOME COMPANIES LIKE SODEXHO ENCOMPASS GROUP AND UNILEVER THEY HAVE. INSTITUTED TIMELINES FOR. ATTACK TRANSITION TO CAGE FREE EGGS THEY NEED THEIR X. APPLY BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO OR EVEN SOONER. AND SO FOR THESE REASONS I I URGE YOU TO REJECT A. B. THIRTY TWENTY ONE AND INSTEAD LEAVE IT TO THE VOTERS. TO ENACT MORE COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE NOVEMBER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HIGH CHAIR CABALLERO AND I EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU I'M JUDY MAN CREW CELL AND I AM THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION. AND I BET ON THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD FOR EIGHT YEARS NOW THAT I AM VERY PROUD. AN HONOR TO SERVE AND WHEN SPEAKER PEREZ APPOINT ME TO THE BOARD HE SAID YOU KNOW JUDY YOU HAVE AN IMPORTANT VOICE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE DO CARE. ABOUT ANIMALS AND WHY I'M HERE TODAY IS WHEN WE PUT THIS BILL ONLINE THROUGH OUR WEBSITE AND LET PEOPLE KNOW. THE LETTERS HAVE BEEN COMING IN ALMOST EVERY MINUTE AGAINST THIS BILL PEOPLE ARE FOR. ANTI CONFINEMENT ANTI CRUELTY SO I KNOW THE LINES GET BLURRED HERE BECAUSE YOU HEAR FROM AG SPECIAL INTEREST FOR THEM IT IS A BOTTOM LINE ISSUE. BUT FOR THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S MUCH MUCH MORE THAN THAT AND PEOPLE WHO EAT CHICKEN <u><c.green>.</c></u> ALL THESE ANIMALS THEY DON'T WANT THE CRUELTY ON THE WAY. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO WHAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE MENTIONED REGARDING HIS LAST BILL HIS LAST BILL HE ASKED YOU. TO. TO OF RESPECT THE VOTERS. OPINION AND. AS THE VOTERS ON THE LAST BILL HE PRESENTED. SPOKE OUT FOR MARIJUANA THEY SPOKE OUT FOR AGAINST CRUELTY IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. OTHER VOTERS IT WAS A HISTORIC AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO EVER VOTED FOR A PROPOSITION THANK YOU. SO WE SAY KICK THIS BILL LET THIS NEXT PROPOSITION THEY MANY OF THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. BUT YOUR CAREER OF MY NAME IS STEPHANIE WILSON I AM AN ATTORNEY FOR MERCY FOR ANIMALS MAY SAY A FEW WORDS I KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE LET FOUR PEOPLE TALK IT'S A LOT MORE THAN HE WAS GONNA LET. IF YOU COULD JUST MAKE IT TELL US YOUR NAME AND YOU YOU I'M ASSUMING YOUR POST AND I NEED TO GET. THIS COMMITTEE MOVING AND I'VE GOT TO GO VOTE IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW SO MANY TURN IT OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR SO. I'M AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS QUESTION AT OPPORTUNITY ASK QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR AND THEN HE CAN COME CONCLUDE. BY SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF SAY AGAIN I'M STEPHANIE WILSON ON BEHALF OF MERCY FOR ANIMALS WE OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO ANYONE ELSE. SING OUT NO ONE ELSE ARE THERE QUESTIONS OF THAT COMMITTEE. MR MATHESON I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO YOU MR MATHIS I'VE GOT TO GO BACK IN AND OTHER COMMITTEE AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THE FIRST. MISTER LEVINE THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS I'VE TALKED WITH THAT SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY. YOU ARE VERY EAGER TO GIVE THEIR BIRDS A LITTLE MORE SPACE. THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. ON JUNE JUST SITTING HERE ON MY PHONE PLAYING UP MY LOCAL TRACTOR SUPPLY OR HAS OVER US SIXTY DIFFERENT TYPES. THAT THAT WE CAN GET IT AND ANYBODY WHO'S ACTUALLY SPEND TIME OUT OF THE CHICKEN RANCH KNOWS THAT DEPENDING ON THE BREED OF THE CHECK IN THEY ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES. ARE BASED UPON THE BREED. SELL ON. IS SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WHAT ONE SPACE FOR FOR EVERYTHING OPERATE ON ME IN YOUR VERY TECHNICAL VERY QUICKLY BASED UPON YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU WANT A RHODE ISLAND RED OR. YOU KNOW LIKE HORNER OR WHAT YOU WANT SELF. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I'M ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. FROM MY SIDE CELL LEAVE IT AT THAT ANY OTHER MEMBERS. MR SONGS. THANK YOU JUST COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND THEN. MAYBE JUST COMMON AFTERWARDS BUT. MISTER LEVINE IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT PRIVATE SAID CHICKEN FROM STANDING SITTING HERE SPREADING ITS WINGS. THERE ISN'T THIS WILL MEET NATIONAL STANDARDS INTO. I THINK GIVE. YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IT IT THE CARE THAT WE NEED TO GIVE TO ANIMALS. FOR THE KARMA THAT I INTO MY CONSTITUENTS EXPECT. AND THEN SECONDLY IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS LEGISLATION WOULD WHICH WOULD PRECLUDE A BALLOT INITIATIVE FROM GOING VOTE. IT DOES NOT AND IT ALSO IS NOT A VIOLATION OF PROP TWO. AND SO. IN YOU SAID ALREADY IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT MAJOR RETAILERS WERE MOVING TOWARDS THIS CAGE FREE MODEL. THIS IS THEIR ACTION THE INDUSTRY IS GOING AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA. SO GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS PROPOSITION TWO WHAT'S OUTLINED IN THIS LEGISLATION DO YOU SEE THAT IS IMPROVING FOOD SAFETY CONSUMER PROTECTION AND. OBVIOUSLY ANIMAL WELFARE IS WE BASICALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA MEET THE ALL THREE OF THOSE SCHOOLS. THANK YOU. MISTER GALLAGHER. I KNOW QUESTIONS COMMENT I MEAN PROP TWO WAS WAS OF A WOMAN THE SUCCESSFUL. MINUTES IGNORANCE INEFFECTIVENESS AND WHAT IT DID DO WAS KILL ALL THE SMALL EGG FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA TO TAKE THEM OUT OF BUSINESS WE GOT FROM EIGHTEEN MILLION UNDER ELEVEN MILLION. AND SEND THOSE TO MEXICO. AND OTHER STATES WHERE THEY HAVE. WHERE THEY HAVE VERY INHUMANE? TREATMENT OF OF THEIR HEADS OTHER EGG LAYING HENS SO. BOTH IGNORANT AND IF ANY EFFECTIVE. THAT'S WHAT PROP TWO DID. PUT YEAH RIGHT SIXTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE VOTERS VOTED FOR. PRIDE BECAUSE LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. OF THE POPULATION ACTUALLY IS ENGAGED IN THIS INDUSTRY AND KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS THERE. AND IS YOU KNOW VERY GOOD STEWARDS VERY GOOD STEWARDS. A OF THEIR HANDS. AND. SO YOU KNOW. IT'S A TRAVESTY OR EVEN IN THIS SITUATION IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT PERHAPS. PERHAPS MAYBE THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO HAVE. TWO DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS FOR EXAM CALIFORNIA AND IT MAY BE THAT THE TRULY TRULY PROP TO CAGE FREE HAND. CAGE FREE A COMMISSION AND THE CALIFORNIA EGG COMMISSION WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN CREATED. BUT MAYBE THAT'S WHERE WE CAN HANDLE THIS ISSUE MORE EFFECTIVELY IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER ANY OTHER MURDERS IN THE SEGMENT. WELL JUST TO I REMEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT MOST THE MOST BECAUSE WE SAID THAT CHICKENS ONE DAYS ZERO SEE YOUR WE ALSO OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED DOWN MARRIAGE EQUALITY.

FOR FOR TRAINING AND THEN NOW. CAREFUL. EVEN THOUGH THE. I THINK IT. PRESENT. AS I HAD. ALL. ONE OF THE BILL ON. SEC. THAT'S A. HI. RUNNING BACK AND FORTH. AB EIGHT HUNDRED YOU THE CLIP NOW THAT. HYDROPONIC. OKAY. YEAH I GOT. IRWIN. I'M MEMBERS IF YOU. SEATS BACK ON THE DYESS WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD. WITH THE BE TWENTY ONE SIX SIX. THE CHAIRS BILL AND THEN SHE WILL ALSO BE. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN MISS IRWIN SPILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TWENTY ONE SIXTY SIX THE CALIFORNIA FARM BILL. THIS THIS CALIFORNIA FARM BILL HAS THREE CORE TENANT FIRST IT IMPROVES THE STATE'S STANCE TOWARDS THE BUSINESS OF AGRICULTURE. AND AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS SEEN DRAMATIC CHANGES IN HOW IT MUST OPERATE. FOOD SAFETY CONCERN FROM THE CONSUMER. STATE REGULATIONS ON PESTICIDE WATER ENERGY SOIL AND WORKERS AND IN THE PAST TWO YEARS A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN AVAILABLE WORKERS REGARDLESS OF WAGES AND OVERTIME A LOT OF THIS YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY. THE CALIFORNIA FARM BILL TAKES ACTION TO IMPROVE THE STATE AND INDUSTRIES WORKING RELATIONSHIP TODAY. BY EASING REGULATORY CONFLICTS WITH THE CREATION OF A CD OF FATE LED MULTI AGENCY REVIEW COUNCIL. TO IDENTIFY AND RECOMMEND RESOLUTION WHEN COMPLIANCE WITH ONE REGULATION POTENTIALLY CREATES CONFLICT WITH ANOTHER. IT FUNDS FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO CDF FACE INVASIVE PLANT AND PEST MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS FUNDS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CALIFORNIA GROWN MARKETING AGREEMENT. FUNDS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO CDFA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CENTRALIZED AG BUSINESS PORTAL. AND REQUIRES THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. TO DEDICATE RESOURCES TO CAPTURE THE FARM TO FORK ECONOMIC IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE. SECOND IT CREATES A STATE WIDE AG INNOVATION PLATFORM. AG AND BROUGHT CALIFORNIA ARE INTRINSICALLY INTERTWINED AND AS GOES AG SO GOES RURAL CALIFORNIA. WANTED TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FOR RURAL RESIDENTS IN MY COMMUNITY AND AT FIRST AT MY THOUGHT WAS THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE AG TOURISM. BUT I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THE AG INDUSTRY. QUESTIONS ITS SURVIVAL IN THE STATE AND THAT LEAVING. AND THAT LEAVING WILL BE A DEATH BLOW TO RURAL COMMUNITIES AND EFFORTS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES SO IT IS NOT ABOUT ACTORS THEM AT THE GROUND LEVEL IT'S ABOUT SAVING ACT SO THAT THERE CAN BE ACTORS IN THE FUTURE. I REALIZE THAT PROGRAMS LIKE SWEEP AND HEALTHY SOILS ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED. TIMELY GRANT PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT SCALE. AG TECH ACROSS ALL FARM SIZES AND TYPES BUT THEY HAVE PROGRAMS THAT IMPROVE AG PRACTICES SO I SUPPORT THOSE. AG TENT TECH IS A NASCENT TECHNOLOGY VERTICAL THE CYCLE OF VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING. COMPANY GROWTH AND WEALTH CREATION THROUGH MERGERS ACQUISITIONS ARE STOCK OUR OFFERINGS IS JUST BEGINNING. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WEALTH CREATION IN RURAL AREAS THROUGH AG TECH ISRAEL IF CALIFORNIA CAPTURES AG TECH FOCUS VENTURE CAPITAL DOLLARS UNDER MANAGEMENT. AND IS HOME TO AG TECH INNOVATORS AND START UP COMPANIES. AND BE AN EXAMPLE IS THE BUT IS THE BLUE RIVER TECHNOLOGIES PRECISION WEEDING. THROUGH LASERS THAT LASERS THAT WAS ACQUIRED BY JOHN DEERE. UP FOR OVER THREE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHO KNEW THAT YOU COULD DO THEY USE LASERS AT IT TOO TO WEED. I USED TO GET PAID TEN CENTS A BUCKET WHEN AS A KID SO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC LASERS. THE CAP. PICK HIS HOW MUCH CERTAIN THE CALIFORNIA OF FARM BILL BRINGS BEST PRACTICES USES CASES TOGETHER FIRST FOR A STATEWIDE PLATFORM IT FINDS TWENTY MILLION TO CDFA DID DEVELOP THE AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION INSTITUTE. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND ITS MODELED OFF OF FOUR OTHER STATE CREATED INSTITUTES TO IDENTIFY AND COMMERCIALIZE NASCENT TECHNOLOGIES INIS INDUSTRIES IT FUNDS TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUAL TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES DIVISION TO HIRE AND RETAIN COOPERATIVE EXTENSION EXPERT ADVISORS. AND PROVIDES TAX INCENTIVE CREDITS TO ADOPTERS OF AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY. ONLY WHEN DEPLOYED ON PRODUCING HARVESTABLE ACRES WITH THE GOAL TO REDUCE ENERGY WATER FERTILIZER PESTICIDE USE OR TO AUTOMATE PLANTING THINNING HARVESTING A PRODUCTION SERVICES. AND EXPANDS ON REGIONAL EFFORTS IN IN THE STATE. I'M MOST NOTABLY IN SALINAS FRESNO IN SAN LUIS OBISPO AND DAVIS TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY INCUBATORS AND ACCELERATORS. SO WHAT IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS WE'RE FACING COMPETITION IN OTHER STATES THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING AND WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE. OUGHT WE ARE COMPETITIVE AND THAT WE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP HERE. AND THIRD IT PROVIDES FOR RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION BURKE DEPRESSION CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAS BEEN AN EVEN RURAL COMMUNITIES FEEL LIKE OR FOLLOW THE FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND. SO THE IDEA WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRAIN RURAL CALIFORNIA YOUTH. FOR FARMS OF THE FUTURE AND IT CREATES MORE FARMS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO BE AG TECH SHOWCASES AND REAL WORLD CAREER PATHS AND ENCOURAGES AG TECH COURSEWORK EXPANSION. TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM.

THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY IN RURAL CALIFORNIA IS A RUTTED DIRT ROAD. WE ARE DRIVE OUT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. I'M DOCTOR JOHN COBB SHIMA YOU SEE CORPORATE DISSENSION ADVISOR EMERITUS. I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SIX SPECIFICALLY OF THE FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE'S STATEWIDE PLANT PEST PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. HAS A VICE PRESIDENT WHO MUST AND MENTIONED EARLIER ON JULY ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH. WE HAD INVASIVE SPECIES SOMEWHAT HERE AT THE STATE CAPITOL. AND OF THE. SUMMIT. SPECIFICALLY ARE ADDRESSED THE NEEDFOR BRINGING OUR PEST BENSON PROGRAM THE TO TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. AND SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDED INCREASING THE DOLLARS FOR THE PAST PREVENTION. OF PLAN. DURING MY CAREER I HAVE WORKED IN THE. LAST FORTY YEARS. ON ALMOST EVERY MAJOR INVASIVE PESTS THAT IS COMING TO CALIFORNIA. AND I'VE WORKED O. WITH CDFA AND AND WHAT ITS PARTNERS SUCH AS USDA. DOWN I I MUST ADMIT AT TIMES I WAS HIGHLY CRITICAL BUT THE MAJORITY TO TIMES I BELIEVE WE HAVE. PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST. SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD. IN FACT. WHEN I TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD WE ARE. BROUGHT UP AS AN EXAMPLE. OF HOW YOU DEAL WITH INVASIVE PESTS. AND I I THINK THAT. THOUGH FUNDING CUTS THROUGH THE YEARS HAVE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THAT POSITION. WE HAVE SEEN. RECENTLY IN IT INCREASE AS OF US PRESENT HIM SOME MENTION IN PAST COME IN AND TO CALIFORNIA AND WE SEEM AN. INCREASE IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PESTS THAT OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS A SMALL WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN WE HAVE. FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN I WAS A. A YOUNG MAN I THINK IT WAS A FEW MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE HUGE URBAN FOREST. THAT WOULD BECOME THE NEW PATHWAY FOR INVASIVE SPECIES TO ENTER CALIFORNIA BUILD UP TO TREMENDOUS NUMBERS AND EXPLODE. NOT ONLY INTO AGRICULTURE BUT INTO THE URBAN FORCING RIPARIAN FORESTS. WE ARE NOW FACING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DAMAGE OF. OF NOT ONLY. THE INTRODUCED PLANT SPECIES THAT WE FIND IN OUR LANDSCAPES BUT ALSO OUR NATIVE SPECIES. ARE. ONE PASSED THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW THE SHUTTLE BOARDS. OUR NOW HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES AND SIXTY THREE REPRODUCTIVE POLLS. MANY OF THEM NATIVE SPECIES. AND THE SAN DIEGO. THEY HAD. HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND WILLS WHAT'S IS THE. OF. HABITAT FOR INVASIVE SWIMMING FOR A HOME. ENDANGERED SPECIES. AND THAT. THAT TIJUANA RIVER WAS WIPED OUT IN NINE MONTHS. BECAUSE WE ALLOW THIS PAST TO BUILD UP IN THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT AND HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN. WELL NUMBER ONE WE HAVE HUGE URBAN FORCE AND NUMBER TWO WE HAVE. THE INABILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO RESPOND HAS TO HISTORICALLY HAVE RESPONDED. BECAUSE OF THE CUTS THAT THEY'VE HAD TO ENDURE. AND IF USDA DOESN'T BRING AND QUARANTINED. QUARANTINES AND OUR DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE QUARANTINE THAN CDFA IS NO LONGER. IN A POSITION TO RAPIDLY RESPOND TO THE INVASIVE SPECIES BUT THE PLOY PROGRAMS THAT BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST. SO. I I'M ASKING AND URGING THIS COMMITTEE TO PLEASE. PORK THE FUNDING FOR THE PLANT PREVENTION. PORTION OF SEATED BASED BUDGET SO THAT THEY CAN REBUILD AND ALSO. THERE ARE THERE HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN TECHNOLOGY. THAT OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND TO ADDRESS. AND. INVASIVE PASSED AND WE WILL NEED. A INFUSION OF DOLLARS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND TO BRING US UP BACK UP TO THE LEVEL WE NEED TO BE FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ES SAID EARLIER MONEY WAS GOING TO HUMUS DENY SERVICE VICE PRESIDENT FOR AG NATURAL RESOURCES. I'M THRILLED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY EARLIER TODAY TO OFFER SOME OVERVIEW COMMENTS ABOUT AGRICULTURE NATURAL RESOURCES ARE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE DO. I'M HIT THRILLED TO BE HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE BILL HOWEVER I MUST STATE THAT I'M SPEAKING TODAY AS AN INDIVIDUAL EXPERT WITHIN MY FIELD. AND A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL NOT AN OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF YOU SEE. WE ARE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR CHAIR CABALLERO SUPPORT AND INTEREST IN REBUILDING COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. IT'S TRUE THE NUMBER OF COOPERATIVE EXTENSION ADVISORS HAS FALLEN DRASTICALLY OVER THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. IN FACT WE CURRENTLY HAVE APPROXIMATELY HALF THE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SPECIALIST AND ADVISERS THAT WE HAD TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. WITH DRAMATIC BUDGET CUTS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DURING THE NINETEEN NINETIES RECESSION AND THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ECONOMIC CRISIS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE NUMBERS OF ADVISORS WE ONCE HAD. SOME OF THIS IS BECAUSE A IN OUR IS A DIVISION WITHIN THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND AS THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET IS CUT IT AFFECTS THE PROGRAM SUCH AS COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND FOR H.. ó AND OTHER PROGRAMS. THE FUNDING IN THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE NEW SPECIALIST AND ADVISERS AND ALLOW US TO TARGET THOSE TO SOME OF THE MOST SEVERE CHALLENGES. ARE FARMERS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE CURRENTLY FACING DROUGHT CLIMATE CHANGE INVASIVE SPECIES NATURAL DISASTERS AND MORE. THAT SAID I MUST ALSO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE UC DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BILL AS OF THIS TIME. WE ARE VERY ENGAGED WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE BILL SUCH AS INVASIVE SPECIES AND DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES FRAG WHICH I TOOK PART IN MY EARLIER POST MONEY. SO AGAIN THANK YOU AND I WE ARE GRATEFUL TO SEE A CALIFORNIA FARM BILL ON THE TABLE TO SHARE. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE OUT THERE IN SUPPORT. AARON. EHRENREICH VERY GOOD CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE ALMONDS GRAIN AND FEED EGGS FARMERS FLORAL WHEAT GROWERS BEING SHIPPERS PAIRS POULTRY SEEDS AND THE WAREHOUSE ASSOCIATION. SECURE MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL INSUPPORTABLE. MOST ORDER ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY WINE MAKERS OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. SEEN IN A YEAR NO OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY OF OPPOSITION. NOT IN OPPOSITION TO BE CLEAR WE JUST SHARED A LETTER OF CONCERN THIS MORNING WITH STAFF AND ARE EXCITED ABOUT SOME ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BILL. AYE WE SHARED A FEW POINTS THAT WERE INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO DISCUSS WITH BE OUR AUTHOR MOVING FORWARD. ONE JUST TO SAY WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT A CALIFORNIA FARM BELT WE THINK IT'S NOT REALLY EXCITING MOMENT IN CALIFORNIA TO BE THINKING ABOUT. ARE THE LEADERSHIP THAT A FARM BELT CAN PROVIDE OPTICALLYON THE EVE OF A FEDERAL FARM BILL BEING DISCUSSED. BUT IN PARTICULAR WE SEE A FEW POINTS MISSING ONE I'M WE FEEL THAT ANY CONVERSATION AROUNDS A FARM BILL AND AROUND FARMING IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD INCLUDE A DISCUSSION AROUND FOOD. PROPERTY CLEAN SOME OF THE BOB RURAL COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF THE ARE SOME OF THE POOREST COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE SOME OF THE MOST FOOD INSECURE. AND SO WAS THE LOOK AT THAT MARRIAGE OF FOOD AND FARMING WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FOOD NEEDS AND SOME OF OUR RURAL COUNTIES. I WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY NEEDS DIRECTION ON AND THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T REMAIN AGNOSTIC ON TECHNOLOGY AND SO. BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME CONTINUE DISK DIRECTION AYE TO THAT TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL INVESTMENTS IS ESSENTIAL. I'M EXCITED ABOUT SERVE WATER THAT THE PARAMETERS WE CAN PROVIDE FOR THAT TECHNOLOGY. WE ALSO MADE EXCITED AND AND FULLY SUPPORT INVESTMENTS AND YOU SEE COOPER EXTENSION BUT ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT LARGER INVESTMENTS IN SUSTAINABLE AND CUTTING EDGE AGRICULTURE AND WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO. IN THE U. SEASON BEYOND TO MOVE AGRICULTURE FORWARD IN THE STATE. AND FINALLY. WE WERE WORRIED IN THE CURRENT LEGISLATION THAT FARMWORKERS ARE OVERLOOKED AND SO WANT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. AROUND MAKING SURE THAT OUR FARMWORKERS AND OTHER FOOD CHAIN WORKERS ARE MORE INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSAL.

LA SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO I HAVE TWO VERY PATIENT WITNESSES HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE ONE THIRTY. THANK YOU. WHO ALL MAKE A VERY BRIEF? TESTIMONY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HEARING LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS AMY DILISIO NUMBER THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE CENTER FOR WELLNESS NUTRITION. AND I'M A REGISTERED DIETITIAN BY TRAINING AND HAVE WORKED ON IN COMMUNITIES ON NUTRITION EDUCATION AND INTERVENTIONS FOR THE PAST TWELVE YEARS. I AM VERY PLEASED TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT HEALTHY RETAIL INITIATIVES TODAY AND THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON COMMUNITIES AND INCREASING ACCESS TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND HEALTH. LOOKING UNIT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY HIGH RATES OF OBESITY IN THE LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS ESPECIALLY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. THE GOAL OF HEALTHY RETAIL INTERVENTIONS IS TO EXPAND THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF FRESH FOODS FOR CONSUMERS AND IN TURN MAINTAIN OR INCREASE. SALES FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THE MAJORITY OF PURCHASING DECISIONS ARE MADE IN THE STORES SO HAVING HEALTHY FOODS. EASILY AVAILABLE FOR CUSTOMERS HELPS TO INFLUENCE HEALTHY FOOD PURCHASES. IN SACRAMENTO SMALL STORE OWNERS RECEIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SMALL INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE STOCKING AND SALES OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. HAVE A FEW EXAMPLES SO AN EXAMPLE IS A THREE TIERED BASKET PLACE NEAR THE CHECKOUT FILLED WITH FRESH FRUITS. I'M WITHIN ONE WEEK THE STORE OWNER REPORTED THAT THEY HAD TO RESTOCK THE POTUS AND NOTED THAT THE PIOUS SOLD OUT VERY QUICKLY. AND ANOTHER INSTANCE THE STORE OWNER RECEIVED A SMALL REFRIGERATOR FOR FREE AN AGREEMENT TO STOCK IT WITH HEALTHY. FOOD PRODUCTS HE MADE HIS OWN OF SALADS AND FRESH CUT FRUIT INSIST CREATED HIS OWN HEALTHY FOOD LABELS HE WAS EXCITED TO SUPPORT ITS CUSTOMERS HEALTHY REPORTED. PROFITABLE SALES EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF PURCHASES AT SMALL STORES ARE FOOD OR BEVERAGES THAT ARE ALMOST CONSUMED IMMEDIATELY SO HAVING ACCESS TO FRESH HEALTHY READY TO EAT FOODS IS VERY IMPORTANT. FOR COMMUNITIES MANNERS TO PICK HEALTHIER CHOICES AND IS ALSO MANY STORIES NEED HOPE. HOW THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CARRY THESE PERISHABLE ITEMS? ALSO ANOTHER RESULT OF A HEALTHY RETURN INITIATIVE AND HOW LOS ANGELES WE LEARNED EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF CUSTOMERS NOTICED HEALTHY SIGNAGE AND SEVENTY TWO PERCENT OF THOSE CUSTOMERS. CHANGE THEIR PURCHASING PATTERNS BASED ON THESE AND PURCHASE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT LEAST ONCE. PER WEEK FROM THE SMALL STORE. OWNERS WERE MOST INTERESTED IN BEING ABLE TO OFFER DISCOUNT COUPONS AS A STRATEGIC COMPLEMENT IN STORE CHANGES IN MOSTAR OWNERS ARE INTERESTED IN CARRYING HELP MORE OF BROADER SELECTION OF HEALTHY FOODS. IN EXCHANGE. BUT THEY HAD A BARRIER IN SOURCING OF FRESH PRODUCE. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CONNECTIONS TO AFFORDABLE DISTRIBUTORS WERE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDS. IN CLOSING HEALTHY RETAIL PROGRAMS ARE MAKING IMPACT ACROSS THE STATE AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO FRESH PRODUCE OTHERWISE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE THERE. INCREASING HEALTHY FOOD PURCHASING FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND ENCOURAGING PARTICIPATION OF LOCAL CORNER STORES IS A WIN WIN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN A AN URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE REBEKAH DELAURO SO WITH LATINO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. AND WE ARE. PROD CO SPONSOR OF THE LEGISLATION. EXCITED THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM IS EXPANDING THAT THE PROGRAM TO INCLUDE SMALL BUSINESSES. LCH THE WE TAKE A BROAD APPROACH TO HEALTH BY ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WHICH INCLUDE OF MORE BROADER APPROACHES TO GETTING OUT THE ROOT CAUSES OF CHRONIC DISEASE. IN CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA. THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR IT LATINO COMMUNITIES ARE. RELATED TO CHRONIC DISEASE SO WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO REALLY GET AT THE ROOT CAUSE. OF. POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES ARE THE LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN AND ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. IDENTIFIER ANDREA AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY FIVE OTHER SALADA MOMENTUM IN THEIR COMMUNITIES ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE WORK AND. AT LC EACH HE IS TO INCREASE ADVOCACY CAPACITY AMONG THE THE LATINO COMMUNITY. SPECIALLY WITH A OUR YOUTH THROUGH OUR HOUSE HELP FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM A WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. WORK WITH FOR EXAMPLE. OPENNESS ON THOSE I WHICH IS A HEALTH. USE ORGANIZATION BASED OUT OF WATSONVILLE THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING IN PARTNERING WITH SMALL BUSINESSES. TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE CORNER STORES ARE ABLE TO RECONFIGURE. THERE. AREAS THAT THEIR BUSINESSES TO MAKE THE HEALTHIER CHOICES THESE ARE CHOICES IN THE COMMUNITIES. AND WE'RE EXCITED TO COLLABORATE AGAIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING AND THEIR PARTNERS AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ENABLE. VERY GOOD IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MICHAEL TO MAKE RICHARD CHANGE AS A CO SPONSOR WE. JR YES FOR. COOL ACCOUNTING WITH THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AMERICAN STROKE ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE AT YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ARMONK TINSMITH WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK ALSO IN SUPPORT. VALERIE NARROW FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RENNSPORT NECESSARILY COULD SMALL BUSINESS BILL. DAVE RUNS AND CAMINO IT'S WITH FAMILY FARMERS WE SUPPORT. I NEVER SEE MY NAME THIS TIME PAUL TOWERS WITNESSES THAT ACTION NETWORK AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION. HI ACTUALLY ATILLA BRUSH WITH HELP FROM FARM BUREAU WHERE IT. AND SO CERTAINLY WE WANNA THANK WITH SEARCHING FOR BEING A LEADER IN THIS ISSUE INSECURITIES A HUGE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING SEEN UP DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF. ENFORCEMENT DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON THIS BILL. AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW. ONLY FOR A FIFTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA COUNTIES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM. AS YOU ALL MAY KNOW ALMOST EVERYONE OF YOUR RURAL COUNTIES ARE REPRESENTED HERE. AND AND THEY HAD EVEN MORE PRESSING FOR ITS SECURITY ISSUES EVEN MORE PRESSING FOR ACCESS ISSUES WITH HIGHER DENSITY OR HIGHER INTENSITY OF FOOD DESERTS. WE WOULD ASK THAT THIS BE BROADENED TO INCLUDE AN ELIGIBILITY FOR RURAL COUNTIES TO COMPETE THAT TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN A PILOT PROGRAM. WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO HAVING CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPONSOR AND THE AUTHOR ON THAT'S THANK YOUR IMAGE MAKE VERY MUCH. SORRY CHAIR MEMBERS CUT THE MUSTARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES I MISS THE SUPPORT MIND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THINK. THE REMATCH. KATE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. MATHIS. BOB. BUT I YOU KNOW I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE BILL BUT YOU KNOW I MASS. IF YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT YET. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE RURAL COMMUNITIES AT THE TABLE ON THIS BILL AND IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY I'M I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT RURAL COMMUNITIES. HAVE LOTS OF FOOD DESERT'S AND SMALL BUSINESS IS WHAT WE LIVE OFF IN A ROW ME SO I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THE FIVE WILL SUPPORT A BILL TODAY. SO WE I'D I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. IF I COULD MISTER KING I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A DITTO ALTHOUGH I WAS JUST SAYING YOU CAME TO THE WRONG COMMITTEE AND JUST HAVING BECAUSE IT THE BIG CITIES. EARLY GET THROUGH THEM BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY FEELS THE SAME WAY I WAS GONNA CHANGE THE BILL BUT IT YOU JUST GOTTA ADD SOME RURAL COMMUNITIES MISTER SOLACE I JUST ON THAT POINT I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD A DOE. ME MISTER TING ABOUT THIS DISCUSSION AS WELL ABOUT THE RULE AREAS IN THE FOOD DESERTS. IN OUR DISCUSSIONS MISTREATING SEEM VERY AMENABLE TO OPENING UP TO COUNTIES THAT ACTUALLY HAD THESE MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY EMBRACE THESE. WE. OUT. THESE PROGRAMS SO I'LL SONGS THAT STILL THE CASE RESTRICTING. MR MATHIS. DITTO UMDNJ LUCK THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ITSELF. MY DISTRICT. NOW IF YOU JUST LOOK AT TULARE IN FRESNO COUNTIES THERE THAT TO POOREST COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE STATE. THEY HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST LATINO POPULATIONS IN THE ENTIRE STATE. AND THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED. I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT. I THINK A LOT OF THE MEMBERS APPEAR ON THE DIETS A LOT OF OUR RURAL MEMBERS ARE NOT OKAY WITH THAT AS WELL. IN INTELLIGENCIA. THAT ADDED IN WHERE ARE OTHER DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ACROSS THE STATE BESIDES JUST. FOR COUNTIES ARE INCLUDED. I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT AS WE LOOK AT ASPECTS TO HELP WITH FOOD INSECURITY. HELP OUR LATINO POPULATIONS IS AS WE TRY TO DO THESE THINGS THAT WE AYE SHARE OUR DISADVANTAGE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. SO I WILL BE VOTING NO I URGE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO VOTE NOW AND TELL. YOU GIVE US A COMMITMENTS. TO TAKE SOME AMENDMENTS AND ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SO WE CAN ADDRESS. FOOD SECURITY WHERE IT TRULY TRULY NEEDS THE HELP ACROSS THE STATE. WITHOUT JUST PICKING. FOR COUNTIES. THANK YOU. IT IS SO RARE WE GET TO PICK ON THE BIG CITY GAS. IT'S NICE TO BE IN THE AG COMMITTEE. MR THING I'M GONNA GO AHEAD SUPPORT YOUR BILL DAY BUT I I WOULD ECHO THE. COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES HAD YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE. KEEP IN MIND OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE WORKED TOGETHER ON MANY THINGS. TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN RURAL CALIFORNIA BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS LEGISLATION TO. ABBY INCLUSIVE. OF RURAL CALIFORNIA IS ONE. CAN WE GET A COMMITMENT FROM YOU TODAY THAT YOU WILL. AND MEN THAT. SO SO THE CHAIR ASKED ME TO WAIT TO RESPOND EVERYBODY WOULD TELL EVERYONE SPOKE AND I'M RESPECTING THE CHAIR. MR FAR HAVE RESPONDED THREE CHECK THINK THAT WAS THE LAST ONE THAT I JUST WANTED EVERYBODY GET THEIR PUNCHES IN BEFORE PACKAGES. IN HOA BAG MISTER MISTER GRAY'S YOU KNOW COME RIGHT EFFORTS HARD WE COULD TAKE A PUNCH. I LOVE THE PREMISE OF THE BILL ON THE BE LAYING OFF OF A TAKE AND I LOVE TO SUPPORT IT ON THE FLOOR BUT THANK YOU. MISTER TING. SO ARM THIS BILL THE THIRD TIME A THIRD YEAR THAT I'VE RUN THIS BILL IN THE IN THE PREVIOUS SINK OUR CONSIDERATION IT WAS A STATEWIDE BILL. WE DID TRY TO USE OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY MONEY FROM THE P. YOU SEE BECAUSE IT WAS A LARGE POT OF MONEY THAT DID NOT GET USED. I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER USE FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY LIKE REFRIGERATION I THINK I AND IT WAS A STATEWIDE BILL THAT WAS NOT ON ANY COUNTIES. SO WE DECIDED TO USE MAKE THIS A PILOT DEL SO THIS IS REALLY A PILOT BILL IT'S NOT A. STATEWIDE BILL IN A STARTED OFF AS A SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES BILL BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE ONLY TWO. COUNTIES THAT WE KNEW ACTUALLY HAD EXISTING PROGRAMS SINCE THEN ALAMEDA AND SAN DIEGO EXPRESSED INTEREST. OUT WHAT I TOLD MR SOLACE YESTERDAY BY PHONE AND I WOULD SAY IF ANY OF YOU. IF YOU'RE COUNTIES OR YOUR CITIES HAVE. COME PROGRAMS THAT ARE A LOT INTEREST WE WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM I THINK WE WERE. WE CHOSE THESE COUNTIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE EXISTING PROGRAMS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURES WHERE THEY ARE WORKING WITH SMALL BUSINESSES IN DOING REFRIGERATION PROJECTS. WE OBVIOUSLY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO FISCAL ISSUES IN DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE COUNTIES MONEY THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO. DO THIS KIND OF WORK. SO IF THERE IS WORK AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH THEM AND AND BRING THEM. SO MISTER KING EVERY I RECALL THIS BEING A PILOT PROGRAM AND I JUST WONDER MY NECK CONFIRMED IT THAT IT IS A PILOT PROGRAM. YEAH THAT'S THE WAY WE ARE CONSTRUCTED EIGHT I AM REMEMBER READING THAT BUT THERE'S A NOTE HERE THAT SAYS IS THERE REALLY A PILOT. THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT WE HAD. IN INTENDED TO CONSTRUE CONSTRUCTION THE BILL PERHAPS ARE. IT EAST BE MAYBE THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE GREATER CLARITY. SO WOULD PROBABLY IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S AT I RECALL IT BEING A PILOT. I CAN'T FIND THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW BUT ALSO. PROBABLY NEEDS AB. A I SUNSET DATE SO THAT WE CAN NOT. ENDED NUMBER TO COME BACK AT THE EARTH THAT THOSE ARE NOT AMENDMENTS OBVIOUSLY THAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO TAKE PART IN THIS WHOLE BUT TO CONSIDER THOSE FOR THE FUTURE. BE HAPPY TO THIS ADDRESS THOSE OF THE NEXT COMMITTEE BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT. THERE'S A REAL INTEREST IN IN USING THIS KIND OF A PROGRAM IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. I I THINK IT'S ANYTIME YOU GOING TO DO A PILOT IT'S GOOD TO TRY IT OUT IN DIFFERENT AREAS TO SEE HOW IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL OR MAYBE HOW IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING TO IMPLEMENT AND I I THINK IT'S A GREAT ELEMENT OF SUPPORT TODAY. AND I LIKE TO SEE US DO MORE OF THIS KIND OF WORK BECAUSE MORE WE CAN PUT THESE REFRIGERATION. DEVICES AT. IN IN OUR OUR STORES IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNIST SELFRIDGE THINKS THAT COULD COULD AGREE MORE I THINK IF YOU COULD HELP US IDENTIFY PARTNERS. MORE THAN HAPPY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN VERY GOOD. SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. SO THE ROLE PLEASE. AB TWO THREE THREE FIVE THE MOTIONS TO PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS COMEY ROI COME BR I MATHIS. MATHIS NO AGUILAR CURRY. A YEAR CURRY AYE FLORA.
