TO START OUR BUDGET SUB SIX HEARING- ON THE- CUVETTE NINETEEN MITIGATION EFFORTS IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. SO WELCOME TO READ SOME HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS LIKE ARE WE ALWAYS DO WHAT IN THE PHYSICALLY. DISTANT IN PERSON HEARING. EVEN THOUGH THIS IS THE LARGEST HERE IN THE CAPITAL WE CAN ONLY ACCOMMODATE A FEW MEMBERS AND A MINIMAL CONTINGENT OF STAFF. THERE WERE ALSO FOLLOWING VERY STRICT PHYSICAL SOCIAL DISTANCING PROTOCOLS I DON'T SEE ANY PUBLIC HERE BUT IF THERE WERE PUBLIC THEY ARE ALLOWED ROOM- THEY'RE ALLOWED TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT PUBLIC COMMENT IS ONE MINUTE LONG AND- THEY DO HAVE A CHOICE AFTER THE MAKEUP PUBLIC COMMENT TO LEAVE THE ROOM OR- THEY COULD. STAY OF COURSE AND CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO THE- REMAINDER OF THE HEARING. THE PANELISTS ON THE AND THE L. A. O. AE APPEARING EITHER IN THE CAPITAL OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS THERE ARE PUBLIC STATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THE AGENDA CONTAINS THE LOCATIONS OF THESE STATIONS INCLUDINGONE. IN CAPITAL PARKER FROM. THE BECAUSE OF MIND HOLD WHETHER. ALBUMS WITH THE WITH GETTING INTO PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE CALL THE OFFICE AT. 916-319-2099 AND A STAFF MEMBER CAN ASSIST YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO EMAIL US PUBLIC COMMENT WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR EMAILS PLEASE EMAIL US AS BUDGET SUB S. U. B. THE NUMBER SIX- ASM DOT C. A. DOT GOV. THE REASON WE'RE HAVING THE HEARING IS- TWO OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF Â‘ THAT HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COVERT CASE AND ALSO THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DEATHS HAVE REALLY BEEN AROUND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AS WELL AS OUR PRISON SYSTEM UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE- DISCUSSED. AT LENGTH THE SOME OF THE REASONS IN PARTICULAR. FOR WHAT CAUSED THE SPIKE IN COVERT CASES IN OUR CORRECTIONS SYSTEM OKAY WELL WE'RE HERE TODAY IS NOT TO SO MUCH DWELL ON THE PAST BUT TO REALLY LOOK AT THE FUTURE. AND FIGURE OUT WAYS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. THE PROTOCOLS- THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED OR HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED- WITH THE BEING FOLLOWED HOW STRINGENTLY THEY'RE BEING FOLLOWED. IT ALSO ON WHAT WE CAN DO TO AGAIN- PROTECT ALL OF CALIFORNIANS. I KNOW WHAT ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE- ONE FACILITY ALONE CREATED A MAJOR OUTBREAK IN HIS. COUNTY WHICH IS I KNOW WHY HE'S- HAD SUCH AN INTEREST ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE SO THE STAKES CAN BE. A RATHER HIGH AND THEN- MANY OF THE AFFECTED INMATES WERE SENT INTO MY COUNTY- FOR CARE SO. AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE SITUATIONS WHICH COULD BE AVOIDED- ARE AVOIDED WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL THE- ALL THE FOLKS WHO ARE HERE TO TESTIFY. ON BEHALF THE DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO THE RECEIVERS HERE AND ALSO VERY THANKFUL FOR THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND HIS TEAM'S REPORT. SO WITH THAT LET ME SEE IF THEY'RE ANY. OPENING COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS. MR WALTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOUFOR CA THIS HEARING ON A VERY TOPIC OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A DUAL PURPOSE HERE NOT ONLY ARE WE INTERESTED IN HELPING TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS BUT ALSO THE- THE INMATES OF CDC ARE ARE A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE A STATE OBLIGATION OF DUTY AND CARE TOWARDS AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT WE'VE EXERCISED OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THAT RESPECT SO. I'M GOING TO BE HERE TODAY AND LOOKING FOR THE TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR FOR WELCOMING ME TO- TO THIS HEARING AT TO JOIN THE COMMITTEE- TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND SOLICIT. INFORMATION IN FREE REMARKS ABOUT MY CONCERN- WHICH PREDATE ANY OPERATE CAN OUR STATE PRISON SYSTEM I IN ADVOCATES HAD. ADVOCATED TWO CDC ARE IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO PLAN FOR. COATED AND- IT WAS A FAILURE TO PLAN. THAT HAS RESULTED IN- IN THE TRAGEDY THAT THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS HAVE SUFFERED. AND MANY HAVE DIED INCLUDING STAFFS. BUT THAT THE GREAT RISK WAS NOT JUST CONTAINED WITHIN THE WALLS OF PRISONS. THE RISK WAS TO COMMUNITIES THAT THE PRISONS ARE LOCATED IN. AND THE HIGHER RATES OF HOSPITALIZATION FOR THE MEDICALLY VULNERABLE. INCARCERATED PEOPLE. WHICH WERE FAR TOO MANY FOR ANY ONE PRISONS COMMUNITY TO HANDLE AND HAS MISTER CHAIR. HAD NOTED SPILLED OVER INTO NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT VERY CLOSELY. WELL THERE'S GREAT TALK ABOUT VACCINES WE KNOW THAT HAVING THOSE VACCINES TO PROTECT EVERYONE IN OUR COUNTRY. IS THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE MONTHS AND MONTHS AWAY AND SO WE NEED TO WORK DILIGENTLY AGGRESSIVELY- AND VERY MINDFUL OF THE DETAILS TO PROTECT BOTH. THOSE THAT WORK AND LIVE WITHIN OUR PRISONS- AND ALSO TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITIES IN THE HOSPITALS THAT SERVE THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPENING COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE WE WILL START WITH OUR INSPECTOR GENERAL. IT ALL YEAH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE TOOL IG REPORTS ON THE DEPARTMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION'S RESPONSE. TO THE NOBLE CORP CORONAVIRUS AS YOU ARE AWARE IN RESPONSE TO THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKERS REQUEST MY OFFICE HAS LOOKED AT TO VERY SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE TO COPE AT NINETEEN. WE EXAMINE THE SCREENING PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT UNDERTOOK TO MAKE SURE. POTENTIALLY AFFECTED THAT OUTSIDERS WERE NOT ALLOWED INTO A PRISON. AND WE LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT USAGE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOCUSING ON THE WEARING OF MASS. AND WE ALSO LOOK AT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIAL DISTANCING AS WELL AS THE ENFORCEMENT OF ITS GUIDELINES. BEFORE GETTING TO THE FINDINGS OF OUR REPORTS I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS OPERATE CREATED A MONUMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND SWEPT THE ENTIRE WORLD CREATING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. CONGREGATE LIVING SITUATIONS SUCH AS PRISONS WERE ESPECIALLY HARD HIT. URBAN AND ITS MEDICAL EXPERTS REACTED QUICKLY AND WITH GREATER URGENCY AT THE OUTSET OF PANDEMIC. AND LIKE ALL OTHER SECTORS OF GOVERNMENT HAD A STEEP LEARNING CURVE. WE APPROACH OUR REVIEW IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE VALUE ADDED AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE LESSONS LEARNT. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE RECEIVER THE SECRETARY AND THEIR STAFF AND SENIOR LEADERSHIP FOR THEIR PROFESSIONALISM. AND THEIR EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE MY STAFF HAD EVERYTHING WE NEEDED TO PROPERLY DO OUR WORK. I HAVE PROVIDED THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE OF FACT SHEET WHICH OUTLINES THE MOST IMPORTANT FINDINGS OVER TO REPORTS MY BRIEFING TO YOU WILL FOLLOW THE FACT SHEET. I FIRST PRESENT YOUR FINDINGS ON THE SCREENING PROCESS BEGINNING. IN EARLY MARCH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. THE DEPARTMENT TOOK SEVERAL STEPS TO PROTECT INSTITUTIONS. FROM STAFF AND OUTSIDE VISITORS WHO COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE CORONAVIRUS INTO A PRISON. THE FIRST THING THE DEPARTMENT DID WAS TO SUSPEND NORMAL VISITATION. THIS IS HAVE AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON THE INCARCERATED POPULATION BUT THERE'S NO ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS A NECESSARY PRECAUTION TAKE. THE NEXT STEP THE DEPARTMENT TOOK WAS TO BEGIN VERBAL SCREENING OF ALL STAFF AND VISITORS WHO ENTER PRISONS. LIKE TWO WEEKS AFTER THE VERBAL SCREENING BEGAN. THE DEPARTMENT ADDED TEMPERATURE SCREENING TO THE ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A PERSON WAS PERMITTED TO ENTER PRISON. WE NOTED SOME DIFFICULTIES THE DEPARTMENT HAD IN IMPLEMENTING THESE MEASURES. FIRST THERE WAS NO STANDARD THAT THE PRISONS USED FOR THEIR SCREENING PROCESS SOME% INSTITUTIONS SCREEN STAFF AND VISITORS AND THEIR VEHICLES BEFORE THEY ENTERED THE MAIN PROJECT AROUND. AND SOME PRESENCE DID NOT SCREEN STAFF AND OTHERS UNTIL AFTER THEY PARK THEIR VEHICLES AND WALKED TO A SCREENING AREA ON PRISON FOR. SOME SCREENING AREAS WERE RATHER PROXIMAL TO THE PARKING AREA BUT AT SOME INSTITUTIONS. PEOPLE WERE NOT SCREENED UNTIL AFTER THEY HAVE A THROUGH AREAS WHERE THEY POTENTIALLY EXPOSE STAFF INCARCERATED PEOPLE PRIOR TO THEIR SCREENING. IN ADDITION WE FOUND THAT WE'RE SCREENING WAS NOT DONE PRIOR TO PARKING. THERE WAS A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD THAT NO SCREENING WOULD BE CONDUCTED. IN THE CASE OF MY OWN STAFF THIRTY EIGHT TIMES OUT OF TWO HUNDRED TWELVE VISITS. MY STAFF WAS NOT SCREENED. THIS EQUATES TO NEARLY 20% OF OUR VISITS. I WANT TO ADD THAT MY STAFF WAS NOT TRYING TO AVOID SCREENING BUT RATHER IN MANY INSTITUTIONS. THE SCREENING LOCATIONS WERE NOT READILY APPARENT AND AT ONE PRISON WE RECEIVED CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS AS TO WHO NEEDED TO BE SCREENED FROM THREE DIFFERENT PRISON STAFF. IN A SURVEY WE CONDUCTED. 5% OF CDCR STAFF WHO RESPONDED. NOTED THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SCRIPT EVERY TIME. SECONDLY WE FOUND THAT LITTLE TO NO TRAINING WAS PROVIDED TO THE SCREENERS. THE SCREENERS WERE A MIX OF CUSTODY AND HEALTH CARE STAFF WHO ARE ASSIGNED TO THE STUDENTS. IT APPEARS THAT NON MEDICAL STAFF WAS NOT VERY WELL TRAINED ON THE THERMOMETERS THEY WERE USING. WE LOOK AT TRAINING RECORDS FOR A SAMPLE OF SEVENTY FIVE SCREENERS AT FIVE DIFFERENT PRISONS. AND FOUND THAT MOST SCREENERS HAVE RECEIVED NO TRAINING. ON THEIR PRISON SCREENING PROCESS. FOR THE VERY FEW WOULD RECEIVE SOME TRAINING. NONE RECEIVE TRAINING SPECIFIC TO THE THERMOMETER THEY WERE GIVEN FOR SCREENING PURPOSES. FINALLY THE EQUIPMENT ITSELF WAS NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE. IN OUR SURVEY APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF THE SCREENERS NOTED THAT THEY HAD ONLY MALFUNCTIONING PARAMETERS TO USE. WE ALSO NOTED THAT MANY STAFF REPORTED TO US THAT THE THERMOMETERS THEY WERE USING STOP WORKING BECAUSE THEY RAN OUT OF BATTERY POWER AND SCREENERS DID NOT HAVE FRESH BATTERIES AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT OF THESE ISSUES WE'VE MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING CHANGING SCREENING LOCATIONS. MAKING SURE SCREENERS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED MAKING SURE THAT THE EQUIPMENT WAS SERVICEABLE. AND MAKING SURE SPUR BATTERIES WERE AVAILABLE. OUR SECOND REPORT FOCUSED ON THE DEPARTMENT USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND MASK USAGE. IN EARLY MARCH THE DEPARTMENT MADE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO LOCATE AND DISTRIBUTE PP FOR THOSE WHO NEEDED TO BE A DIRECT CONTACT. WITH PATIENTS WHO HAVE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CODE NINETEEN OR THOSE INCARCERATED PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN EXPOSED TO POSITIVE CASES OF CODE NINETY. THE DEPARTMENT OF THE MEDICAL STAFF THAT SHOULD BE LAUDED FOR THEIR SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN THE PPP NEEDED. FOR DIRECT CONTACT WITH COLD NINETEEN PATIENTS. IN ADDITION TE DEPARTMENT ALSO PRODUCED AND DISTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND CLOTH FACE COVERINGS FOR ISSUE TO STAFF INCARCERATED PERSONS. DEPARTMENT PRODUCED ENOUGH FACE COVERINGS FOR ALL PERSONS TO HAVE AT LEAST THREE MASKS. SHORTLY AFTER PROCURING ENOUGH FACE MAX THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED DIRECTIVES TO STAFF AND A PERFORATED PERSONS TO WEAR FACE COVERINGS AND RECOMMENDED THAT STAFF AND INCARCERATED PERSONS STRUCK THE SOCIAL DISTANCING. ABOUT ONE MONTH LATER THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED SPECIFIC PHYSICAL DISTANCING DIRECTIVES FOR THE INCARCERATED PERSONS. INEXPLICABLY ONE MONTH AFTER THAT ON JUNE ELEVENTH THE DEPARTMENT RELAXED ITS FACE COVERING REQUIREMENTS FOR STAFF AND ON JUNE TWENTY FOURTH RELAX THE FACE COVERING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INCARCERATED POPULATION. STAFF AND OF COURSE THREE PERSONS WERE ALLOWED TO REMOVE FACE COVERING FALL OUTSIDE AND MORE THAN SIX FEET FROM OTHER RELAXING OF REQUIREMENTS DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF WORK AND LIFE IN A PRISON. WHERE AN INCIDENT REQUIRING IMMEDIATE RESPONSE IS A NORMAL OCCURRENCE. THE RELAXING OF REQUIREMENTS CAME DESPITE THE FACT THAT ACTIVE ON THE RIVER IN AND OUTSIDE OF PRISONS. AND SURVEYS THAT WE CONDUCTED 31% OF RESPONDENTS REPORTED THAT THEY HAD OBSERVED STAFF FAILING TO PROPERLY WEAR FACE COVERINGS. AND 38% REPORTED THAT STAFF ARE CURSORY PERSONS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING ACQUIRE. MY STAFF OBSERVE DEPARTMENTAL STAFF FAILING TO COMPLY WITH FACE COVERING DIRECTORS AT TWENTY THREE OF THE THIRTY FOUR PERSONS THAT WE VISITED. IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE DEPARTMENT VIGILANTLY ENFORCE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR FACE COVERAGE OR SOCIAL DISTANCING DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY OUR REPORT. AT FIVE PRISONS WE CAPTURED THE NUMBER OF SUPERVISORY ACTIONS OF PUNITIVE ACTIONS FOR NON COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY. THOSE FIVE PERSONS EMPLOYED TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO STAFF. OUR OBSERVATION PERIOD TWENTY EIGHT STAFF WERE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISORY ACTION AND ONLY ONE PERSON RECEIVED ADVERSE ACTION FROM THE DEPARTMENT FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH FACE COVERED DIRECTIVES. WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE IN DISCIPLINING THOSE WHO REFUSE TO COMPLY WITH POLICIES THAT ARE FOUNDATIONAL TO STOPPING THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE. I AM AWARE THAT BOTH THE RECEIVER AND SEX AND THE SECRETARY HAVE RECENTLY EMPHASIZED. WITH WARDENS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FORCING THESE POLICIES AND I APPLAUD THEIR EFFORTS. OUR OFFICE OBSERVE FIRST HAND THE POSITIVE EFFECT THAT THIS INCREASED LEADERSHIP EMPHASIS ATTACK. AT A RECENT VISIT JUST THIS WEEK TO SIERRA CONSERVATION CENTER WE OBSERVE WEARING PULSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I AM AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO HELLO MISTER. PUSH MORAL. THANK YOU BECAUSE TOMORROW THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE ARE ASKED TO STOP BY STOP DISCUSS REASON OREGON SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON ON OCTOBER TWENTY AT THE STATE APPELLATE COURT RULED THAT CITIES YOU'LL JUST WANT TO COVER NINETEEN VIOLATE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF INMATES HOUSED AT SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF JUNE SAN QUINN HAS HAD ROUGHLY TWENTY TWO HUNDRED CASES OF COBIT NINETEEN. WITH CASES PEAKING IN JULY ON JULY SEVENTH WITH SIXTEEN HUNDRED ACTIVE CASES. ABSENCE DECLINE SUBSTANTIALLY CURRENTLY THERE ARE ABOUT THREE ACTIVE CASES ODDS OF ONLY NOVEMBER. CITIES ARE STATEMENT NUMBER ACTIONS REGARDING COVER NINETEEN CLEAN TESTING INMATES AND STUFF AS WITH MANAGEMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL AND ALSO HAS CREATED CORE TEAM SPACE AND ISOLATION SPACE FOR INMATES RELEASED ITS SOME INMATES ORDERLY AND LARGELY SUSPENDED IN TAKE. THE LAST OF THESE TO HELP REDUCE YOUTH ARTS POPULATION AT SAN QUENTIN FOR ABOUT FORTY THREE HUNDRED INMATES IN JUNE TO ABOUT TWENTY NINE HUNDRED IN OCTOBER. HOW WOULD THAT DORTMUND DID NOT ADOPT. NATIONS MADE BY PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO DECREASE AND QUINN'S POPULATION BY HALF TO DO THE LIKELIHOOD OF ORDER OUTBREAKS. THEY HAVE HELD COURT FOUND THAT BY NOT ADOPTING THIS RECOMMENDATION. THE DEPARTMENT VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF INMATES HOUSED AT SAN QUENTIN AND PHYSICALLY VIOLATED STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS BANS ON CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT. IN ORDER TO REMEDY THIS THE COURT ORDERED THAT CDCR REDUCE AKRON'S POPULATION ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE INMATES EITHER THROUGH TRANSFERRING INMATES TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS OR BY RELEASING INMATES. SINCE THAT ORDER THE SUPREME STATES FROM COURT IS OPEN A CASE FOR APPEAL. AND HAS EXTENDED THE REVIEW PERIOD FOR THE ORDER UNTIL FEBRUARY SEVENTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE I SAYS THE ORDER IS NOT CURRENTLY IN EFFECT AND WOULD NOT GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL THAT DATE. NUMBER SEVENTIES. THANK YOU KNOW HOW TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO OUR RECEIVER MR KELSO. IF YOU JUST START SPEAKING IT SHOULD SWITCH TO YOUR SCREEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES I CAN HEAR YOU GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD THANK YOU- MY NAME IS CLARK KELSO WHEN I SERVED AS THE FEDERAL RECEIVER. RESPONSIBLE FOR MEDICAL CARE WITHIN CDCR- AS MEMBERS KNOW I WAS APPOINTED TO THIS POSITION- BY THE FEDERAL COURT IN THE CLASS ACTION LITIGATION PLOT OF VERSUS NEWSOME. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT- AND WAS CHARGED WITH BRINGING THE LEVEL OF MEDICAL CARE AND CDC ARE UP TO CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS. AS RECEIVER I EXERCISE ALL THE POWERS THAT SECRETARY- ALISON BUSINESSES. BUT ONLY WITH RESPECT TO THE DEPARTMENT'S MEDICAL CARE SYSTEM. WHICH IS ADMINISTERED. BY CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES C. C. H. C. S. THAT IS WHY SECRETARY OF BOTH SECRETARY ALISON AND I ARE HERE TODAY. I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU JUST AN OVERVIEW OF WHERE WE CURRENTLY ARE AT IN OUR EFFORTS TO COMBAT WILL BE NINETEEN- AND THE INDICATE SORT OF RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN. I WHEN I WENT TO OUR NINTH MONTH OF THE CODE PANDEMIC. DURING THOSE MONTHS WE'VE IMPLEMENTED UNPRECEDENTED ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO RESPOND TO COVERT NINETEEN. AND THOSE CHANGES HAVE BEEN DRIVEN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. BY OUR MEDICAL LEADERSHIP AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. WHO HAVE THEMSELVES CONSULTED REGULARLY WITH PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL- AND LEADING PUBLIC HEALTH AND CORRECTIONAL HEALTH EXPERTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. AND STANFORD. AMONG OTHERS. RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC REMAINS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR C. D. C. R. AND C. C. H. C. S. OUR RESPONSE HAS DEVELOPED OVER TIME AND CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE. AS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE VIRUS AND HOW IT SPREADS INCREASES AND RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO FIGHT THE VIRUS HAVE BECOME AVAILABLE. IT REMAINS A OR RAPIDLY EVOLVING SITUATION OR WE SEE CHANGES STILL ON A DAILY BASIS. ON THE ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY OF A VACCINE THAT MAY HAVE 90% EFFICACY OF BEING JUST THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE. I DO AGREE WITH THE REMARKS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE. THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT VACCINE- DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING IN TERMS OF OUR EFFORTS. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT- UNTIL WE SEE IF THAT VACCINE ACTUALLY MATERIALIZES. AND HOW IT ACTUALLY. WORKS THIS IS NOT A TIME TO RELAX. OCTOBER NINETEEN SPREADS THROUGH CDC ARE THROUGH THREE PRIMARY MECHANISMS- AND WE'VE TAKEN STEPS TO TRY TO MITIGATE EACH ONE OF THOSE FIRST. IT'S INTRODUCED INTO THE INSTITUTIONS FROM STAFF CONTRACTORS AND OTHER VISITORS ARE RESPONSES INCLUDED- CLOSINGS CDCR TO VISITORS BACK IN MARCH. MANDATING THE USE OF FACE COVERINGS AND OBSERVANCE OF DISTANCING AND AS YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD SECRETARY ALISON I BEGAN LAST WEEK A NEW PROGRAM OF MUCH STRICTER ENFORCEMENT IN RESPONSE TO BE DISTURBING FINDINGS BY THE O. I. G. IMPLEMENTING GATE SCREENING FOR STAFF AND CONTRACTORS. IMPLEMENTING SERIAL TESTING FOR ALL STAFF USING BOTH RAPID POINT OF CARE TESTS AND PCR LABORATORY TESTS. IMPLEMENTING CONTACT TRACING FOR ALL STAFF CASES- AND THEN PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR STAFF. THE SECOND MECHANISM OFFERED BILL WOULD COMING IN IS FROM PATIENTS TRANSFERRING THE BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS. ATIONS MOVING OUT AND THEN BACK INTO INSTITUTIONS FROM HOSPITALS AND COURTS. AND THE NEW INMATES COMING IN FROM COUNTY JAILS. OUR RESPONSES HAVE INCLUDED ON MARCH TWENTY FOURTH CLOSINGS CDCR TO INTAKE FROM JAILS. ENFORCING MOVEMENT GUIDELINES TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF SPREADING THROUGH INTER INSTITUTION TRANSFER INCLUDING TESTING WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF TRANSFER BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS. LIMITS ON THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO CAN TRAVEL ON BUSES REQUIREMENTS THAT ALLSTAFF AND INMATES ON BUSES WHERE AN NINETY FIVES. IN REQUIRING FOURTEEN DAY QUARANTINE AND TESTING IT RECEIVING INSTITUTIONS. ON NOW THEY DIDN'T TAKE IT SLOWLY RE OPENING WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH JAILS TO ESTABLISH PROTOCOLS FOR THE SAFETY TRANSFER OF INMATES AND TURNING BACK BUSES FROM TRAILS THAT DID NOT COMPLY WITH THOSE PROTOCOLS. THE THIRD METHOD BY WHICH GRAVERT SPREADS WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS IS BECAUSE OF HOUSING IN OPEN DORMS. CLOSE CONTACT AMONG INMATES AND CLOSE CONTACT BETWEEN INMATES AND STAFF. OUR RESPONSES HERE INCLUDED TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE OVERALL POPULATION IN DORMS. TAKING STEPS TO MOVE THE COVE IN HIGH RISK PATIENTS THE OLDER PATIENTS AND THOSE WITH SIGNIFICANT COMORBIDITIES PLACING THEM AT RISK TO COPE WITH. TAKING STEPS TO MOVE THEM OUT OF DORMS AND INTO SAFER HOUSING. AGGRESSIVELY DISTRIBUTING AND REQUIRING USE OF PP BY OUR PATIENTS. PROVIDING CLEANING SUPPLIES AND HAND SANITIZER. IDENTIFYING ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE SPACE IT NEARLY ALL INSTITUTIONS WHICH IS NECESSARY TO MANAGE OUTBREAKS. IMPLEMENTING CONTACT TRACING FOR ALL PATIENT CASES CONDUCTING REGULAR SURVEILLANCE RESPONSUM SERIAL TESTING FOR ALL PATIENTS USING BOTH RAPID POINT OF CARE TESTS AND PCR LABORATORY TESTS. NOW AS A GENERAL MATTER PRISONS AND JAILS ARE NOT BEEN DESIGNED BUILT OR OPERATED WITH CONSIDERATION OF THE RISKS POSED BY COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. AS NOTED OVER A DECADE AGO BY C. C. H. U. S. A STATEWIDE MEDICAL EXECUTIVE DR JOS A BIT. ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADING EXPERTS ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN A CORRECTIONAL SETTING. QUOTE MOST JAILS AND PRISONS WERE CONSTRUCTED TO MAXIMIZE PUBLIC SAFETY. LOCKS TO MINIMIZE THE TRANSMISSION OF DISEASE OR TO EFFICIENTLY DELIVER HEALTH CLERICAL SCHOOL. THAT IS WHY FACED WITH OVER NINETEEN PRISONS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE STRUGGLED TO PROTECT THEIR PATIENTS. AND WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME STRUGGLES AS OTHER CONGREGATE LIVING ENVIRONMENT SUCH A SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES- SHELTERS AND CRUISE SHIPS. IN GENERAL THESE ARE NOT SAFE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH TO BE HOUSED DURING A PANDEMIC. FOCUSING JUST ON THE FEDERAL PRISON SYSTEM IN THE TEN LARGEST STATE PRISON SYSTEMS CDCR FINDS ITSELF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK CDCR AS HAD A LARGER NUMBER OF CASES PER CAPITA THAN SOME PRISONS. BUT A LOWER NUMBER OF DEATHS PER CAPITA. THE PROGRESS OF PROBING NINETEEN CHRISSY DC ARTS INSTITUTION BECAUSE LARGELY TRACK THE PROGRESS OF THE DISEASE IN THE FREE WORLD. SMALL NUMBERS OF CASES. AND CLIMBING MORE RAPIDLY WITH THE NUMBER OF CASES ACCELERATING IN JUNE A CENTRALLY MIRRORING THE CASE TRENDS IN CALIFORNIA. OUTBREAKS ARE AFTER DROPPING TWO I'M SORRY OF THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE CASES IN CDC ARE PEAK IN EARLY JULY AT TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FOUR. AFTER DROPPING 210-003-0012 IN LATE AUGUST WE EXPERIENCED A SECOND PEAK IN LATE SEPTEMBER. AT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE. OCTOBER SAW A RAPID DROP IN THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE CASES TO A LOW THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY IN LATE OCTOBER. I WOULD RAISE OUR RECENT OUTBREAKS ABSENT UP IN C. B. S. B. HAS RAISED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ACTIVE CASES. TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AS OF TODAY. AND AS OF TODAY WE'VE HAD A- TOTAL SIXTEEN. SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY NINE CASES AND EIGHTY TWO DEATHS. SUMMARY OF OUR RESPONSE WILL NOT BE COMPLETE WITHOUT SPECIAL MENTION OF THE OUTBREAK AT CENTERPOINT. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THAT OUTBREAK WITH THE TRANSFER OF A HUNDRED MAYBE EIGHT PATIENTS FROM THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR MEN TO PRISONS COURT RENDON STANDPOINT. THOSE PATIENTS HAPPEN HOW LARGE DORM UNIT AB CIM WHICH WAS EXPERIENCING AN EXPANDING OUTBREAK IN ITS OTHER UNITS. DURING LATE APRIL AND EARLY MAY WE RESIST THE PRESSURE TO ATTEMPT A MOVEMENT OF THOSE MEN OUT OF CIM BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL FOR INTER INSTITUTION MOVEMENT OF PATIENTS. THAT PROTOCOL. THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED IN THOSE WEEKS WAS PREMISED ON HAVING A POTENTIAL TRANSFER READ TESTED FOR CARBON NINETEEN AND THEN MOVED IF TEST RESULTS WERE BEING NEGATIVE. GIVEN THE SPEED WITH WHICH GOVERNMENT TEAM TEST RESULTS FOR BEING RETURNED AT THAT TIME THE PRACTICAL EXPECTATION WAS A PATIENT WOULD USUALLY BE MOVED WITHIN SEVEN DAYS OF BEING TEST. AND THEN RECEIVING INSTITUTIONS WERE EXPECTED TO CHECK TRANSFER RES FOR SYMPTOMS AND ISOLATE OR QUARANTINE FOR FOURTEEN DAYS. BOB HAS- MEMBERS KNOW THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED. ANOTHER LANGUAGE WHICH APPEARED ON MAY TWENTY SECOND MOVEMENT MATRIX. COLIN SCREENING TEST IF PATIENT IS TO TRANSFER MAY TRANSFER OF COVERT SCREENING TEST NEGATIVE. THAT LANGUAGE DOES NOT EXPRESSLY PROVIDE AS A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT THE TESTING HAD TO HAVE OCCURRED WITHIN SEVEN DAYS OF MOVEMENT. AND BECAUSE OF THAT GAP IN THE MOVEMENT MATRIX LANGUAGE WHEN MOVEMENT FROM C. I AM THE CORPORATE IN SAN QUENTIN BEGAN THE PATIENTS HAD NOT BEEN RETESTED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TRANSFER. WHICH RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER OF MANY PATIENTS WHOSE MOST RECENT NEGATIVE TEST WAS TWO THREE AND FOUR WEEKS OLD. AS IT TURNED OUT TO OF THE SIXTY SIX PATIENTS MOVED TO CORCORAN. TESTED POSITIVE UPON ARRIVAL. OF THE RESULT THERE WAS A MODERATE OUTBREAK THAT PIZZA ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE CASES ON JUNE SIXTEENTH. WITH THE REMAINING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO PATIENTS WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT SAN QUENTIN OF SEVERAL SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS WERE ISOLATED BUT MOST OF THE TRANSFER RES WERE PLACED IN ORDINARY HOUSING. WHICH OF SAN QUENTIN INMATE MANSON BEING HOUSED IN MULTI TIERED OPEN SELF ROUNDHOUSE. AT THE TIME OF THE MOVE TO SAN QUENTIN THE PREDOMINANT VIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WAS THAT OVER NINETEEN SPREAD BY DROPLETS AND CLOSE CONTACTS. BUT DID NOT GENERALLY SPREAD BY AEROSOL IS H. IF THAT HAVE BEEN TRUE SAN QUENTIN'S MULTI TIERED CELLS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SAFER HOUSING ENVIRONMENT THAN THE OPEN AIR DORMS AT CIM. HOWEVER SANDPLAINS EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS OUR SUBSEQUENT EXPERIENCE WITHOUT BREAKS AT FOLSOM AND THE CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION CENTER SUPPORTS THE CONTRARY CONCLUSION. THAT KOBE NINETEEN CAMERA IN FACT READILY SPREAD THROUGH AEROSOLS ASIAN IN A CORRECTIONAL ENVIRONMENT- WHERE PATIENTS BREATHE THEN SHARED AIR SPACE. THAT WAS THE ULTIMATE CONCLUSION REACHED BY DOCTORS BRIE WILLIAMS AND STEFAN OVERDOSING IN THEIR JUNE THIRTEEN REPORT. ON THE SAN QUENTIN OUTBREAK. ON OCTOBER FIVE. THE CDC OF FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AEROSOL SPREAD OF CLOVER. NINETEEN NOW AS SOON AS WE REALIZE WHAT HAPPENED SAN QUENTIN WE SUSPENDED FURTHER UNNECESSARY TRANSFERS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND REDRAFT OF THE TRANSFER PROTOCOLS TO MAKE SURE THE SUCH A TRANSFER WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. IT IS WORTH NOTING- THAT PRIOR TO THE CIM TRANSFERS CDCR HAVE SUCCESSFULLY AND SAFELY TRANSFERRED OME SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED PATIENTS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS. WITHOUT SPREADING PROGRAM NINETEEN. AFTER THE RE DRAFTING OF THE TRANSFER PROTOCOLS AFTER SAN QUENTIN'S OUTBREAK CDC ARE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY AND SAFELY TRANSFERRED OVER SIX THOUSAND PATIENTS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS WITHOUT INCIDENT. THAT'S GOOD NEWS HOWEVER I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I AM CONFIDENT WE WILL ONLY SEE ONE OR MORE TRANSFERS INTER INSTITUTION TRANSFER IS TRIGGERING OUTBREAKS IN RECEIVING INSTITUTIONS. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH OUR TITAN PROTOCOLS THE VIRUS IS A VERY GOOD AT FINDING WAYS OF SPREADING AND CIRCUMVENTING PROTECTIVE MEASURES. AND HUMAN BEINGS WILL INEVITABLY MAKE MISTAKES GIVEN THE VIRUS THE OPPORTUNITY IT NEEDS TO SPREAD. I WANT TO SKIP AHEAD HERE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME BUT IN CONCLUSION- NOTED CDC R. AND C. C. H. C. UP STAFF HAVE PERFORMED WITH COURAGE. AND DEDICATION THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. AND OUR PATIENTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR EFFORTS. BASED ON WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING IN CORRECTIONAL SETTINGS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE CDC'S CORRECTIONAL GUIDELINES- I CAN REPRESENT YOU THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN WITHIN OUR EXISTING ENVIRONMENT TO FIGHT THE SPREAD OF OVER NINETEEN. HOWEVER FROM A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. THE HOUSING CHOICES AVAILABLE TO US WITHIN THE CDC ARE REMAIN PROBLEMATIC. CDC ARE ESSENTIALLY CONSISTS OF LARGE CONGREGATE LIVING FACILITIES A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF WHICH ARE OPEN DORMITORY SETTINGS. THESE DORMITORY SETTINGS IN PARTICULAR ARE THE WORST POSSIBLE SETTINGS FOR CONTAINING THE SPREAD OF THE HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. SO EVEN IF OVER NINETEEN VACCINES BECOME AVAILABLE TO US NEXT YEAR AS I BELIEVE THEY WILL. IT IS I THINK INEVITABLE THE NEW AND POTENTIALLY EVEN MORE DANGEROUS VIRUSES WILL SOMEDAY APPEAR. AND I THINK THE STATE NEEDS TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AND SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT TYPE OF HOUSING OPTIONS NEED TO BE AVAILABLE WITHIN THE CDC OURS INSTITUTIONS. SO THAT WE CAN AVOID THE HARM THAT THE NEXT PANDEMIC IS OTHERWISE SHORT TO COST. THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE SECRETARY ALISON YOU SEE OUR. GOOD AFTERNOON. CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU GREAT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SENIOR REBELLION SHARES OF. YOU CAN SEE JUST RIGHT. VERY GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION EFFORTS. TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF COPE WITH NINETEEN INSIDE OF OUR FACILITIES. SINCE MR KELSO- TESTIMONY PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF WHERE WE ARE IN OUR EFFORTS TO COMBAT KOBE IN NINETEEN INCLUDING THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM SAN QUENTIN. I'M GOING TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON. THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE OFFICES OF INSPECTOR GENERAL'S. REPORT THE FIRST TWO REPORTS IN HIS SERIES OF REPORTS SPECIFICALLY SCREENING AND MASKS. COMPLIANCE I WILL NOT BE COMMENTING ON THE L. A. O.'S- AND DISCUSSION REGARDING THE SAN QUENTIN AND STAGE CREW COURT ORDER AS THEY'VE HIGHLIGHTED. WE ARE STILL EVALUATING OUR OPTIONS AND WE HAVE UNTIL NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH TO RENDER A FINAL DECISION. WHETHER WE WILL BE PETITIONING THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT FOR REVIEW IN THAT CASE. WELL I WILL NOT COMMENT ON PENDING LITIGATION I WILL STRESS THAT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE RECEIVER WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT A VARIETY OF CODED MITIGATION STRATEGIES AT SAN QUENTIN AND THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM. TO KEEP ALL THOSE WHO WORK AND LIVE WITHIN OUR FACILITY SAFE. AS OF TODAY SAN QUINN HAS THREE POSITIVE CASES. WITH ELEVEN STAFF CASES OF I THINK MR KELSO TALKED ABOUT THE STATEWIDE NUMBER SO I WILL NOT REITERATE THAT SO LET ME GO TO TURN TO THE O. I. G. REPORT. WE TAKE THIS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY I WILL SAY KOBE REVOLVES AROUND THE NATION AND WE PIVOTED- AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO THE EVER AND- THE DEMANDS OF COBIT AND HOW AND HOW WE RESPOND TO IT. I WILL SAY NATIONALLY ARE SCREENING DIRECTION WAS NOT CLEAR. WE WERE FOCUSING ON THE INMATE POPULATION WE'RE FOCUSING ON OUR INTEREST IS A SECURE PERIMETER AND THE COLLECTING ARE- ADMINISTRATION BUILDINGS. SO THAT WAS A FAILURE- I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW WITH MOST RECENT DIRECTION AS FAR AS OUR SCREENING. ONE POINT SEVEN TRENDS GENERALLY OUT OF OUR OWN ENTRANCES AT OUR GATES TO OUR FACILITIES HAS PROVEN TO BE. DIABLE IN IMPROPER SCREENING I WILL SAY THAT OUR STATE OR SCREENING MAJORITY OVER SPRING STUFF BY BY NURSING STAFF. AND WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME DIFFICULTY WITH INITIAL EQUIPMENT THAT WE OBTAIN FOR THE NON CONTACT THERMOMETERS WE'VE COME A LONG WAY THERE WE'VE TRIED A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS. AND MOST RECENTLY SELECTED EVEN IF A BETTER OPTION WITH THE BETTER BETTER BATTERY LIFE. SO WE HAVE SINCE SINCE THAT REPORT OBVIOUSLY DONE EXTENSIVE TRAINING TO ALL OF OUR STAFF PROVIDING SCREENING. OF THE DOCUMENTATION IMPROVE FOR PRACTICE ON A MONTHLY BASIS. THE THERMOMETER ISSUE AS IT RELATES TO BATTERY LIFE THAT HAS SINCE I THINK RESOLVED- STAFF KNOW HOW TO EXCHANGE BATTERIES INTO. IMPROVE THE BATTERY LIFE WE'VE WE'VE GONE TO IT A NEW MODEL THAT WE'VE TESTED AT- BUT FOR VERY INSTITUTIONS AND WE ARE ANTICIPATING- ADDITIONAL SUPPLY EACH AND EVERYONE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THAT THE NON TOUCH THE MONITORS IT EVERYWHERE BUT WE ARE ORDERING THESE ADDITIONAL UP LONG BATTERY LIFE ONCE- AND THREE. THE MOMENT WILL BE AT EACH ENTRANCE POINTS OF OUR INSTITUTIONS AND THEY WILL BE DIRECTORSHIP TO OUR FACILITIES. GOES ON- THE SECOND REPORT OF NON COMPLIANCE AS IT RELATES TO WEARING FACIAL COVERINGS. I WILL SAY THAT WE'VE INVOLVED IN THIS AREA AS WELL INITIAL DIRECTION WAS NOT CLEAR IT WAS ALMOST A RECOMMENDATION VERSUS BEING MANDATORY WE'VE COME A LONG WAY WITH THAT- SETTING VERY CLEAR EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE WE TAKE THIS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY WE'VE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION AND SPREAD. OF THIS VIRUS AND MASS MATTER. AND THAT'S THE MESSAGE VERY CLEARLY THAT BOTH RECEIVER KELSO AND I HAVE TAKEN A VERY FIRST STAND ON THIS ISSUE. THERE'S BEEN MULTIPLE MEMOS OUT TO STAFF SOME WHAT CONFUSING FROM ONE MEMBER TO THE NEXT IT JUST. WE WERE TRYING TO EVOLVE AS CODED WAS INVOLVED THE AND SOMETIMES IT WAS NOT CLEAR- AND EVEN THE COMMUNITY AS WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT HAS INVOLVED AS WELL. SO MOST RECENTLY THE MOST RECENT MEMOS DATED OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTH WHERE. IT'S NOT ONLY REINFORCES THE EXPECTATION ABOUT WEARING MASKS BUT IT REINFORCES MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS RESPONSIBILITY AS IT RELATES TO MASK AND HOLDING STAFF ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH OUR CORRECTIVE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS WE FURTHER EMPHASIZED THAT WE WILL HAVE OUR REGIONAL HEALTH CARE EXECUTIVES AS WELL AS OUR ASSOCIATE DIRECTORS. DOING RANDOM SPOT INSPECTIONS AT EACH OF OUR INSTITUTIONS- AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINARY AND SHOULD TENANTS ARE FOR NON COMPLIANCE ARE APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION KERR CAN I HELP SKEWS ME RECEIVER KELSO AND I HELD A CALL ON FRIDAY AND OF WITH VERY CLEAR EXPECTATIONS HOLDING BOARDS AND CEOS RESPONSIBLE. FOR MASS COMPLAINTS WITHIN THEIR INSTITUTIONS. I WILL SAY THAT THAT WAS WELL RECEIVED THEY THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CLEAR EXPECTATIONS AT THE END OF THAT CALL I SAID I NEED YOU TO DO A. B. AND C. AB WELL UNDERSTOOD BUT THE EXPECTATION LAST. SO I FEEL CONFIDENT AS THE DIRECTOR GENERAL JUST STATED WE HAD A INSTITUTION BUT I'M FREQUENTLY AT THE INSTITUTIONS AND ICY- INCREASE COMPLIANCE AT OUR INSTITUTIONS I WILL SAY AN INSTITUTION WITH OUTBREAKS EVERYONE IS FULLY MPP WHEN THEY'RE GOING INTO THOSE BUILDINGS- THE INMATES UNIVERSE WE STRUGGLED WITH GETTING TO MAKE COMPLAINTS AS WELL THAT COMES WITH PATIENT EDUCATION FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS DISEASE. AND MANY OF THEM I WILL SAY HAVE BEEN A SYMPTOMATIC SO THEY THINK IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL BUT IT IS A BIG DEAL- BECAUSE THEY MITCHELL FINE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE SITTING AROUND IF THEY TRY TO EXERCISE OR SOMETHING THEN THEY QUICKLY REALIZED. ADULT PROBLEM SO I. JUST WILL SAY THAT WE'VE SEEN. INCREASING COMPLIANCE WITH SEEN. AS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD WE STRUGGLED EARLY ON WITH- RECEIVE HAVING. HE AVAILABILITY NOW WE HAVE OVER TWO YEAR SUPPLY OF PP WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS SO VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO- MAINTAIN THAT WE MONITOR THOSE VERY VERY CLOSELY. A FEW OTHER THINGS I'D LIKE TO MENTION IS THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF OUR POPULATION. CURRENTLY OUR INSTITUTION CAMP POPULATION IS AT NINETY FOUR THOUSAND THIS IS THE LOWEST IN THREE DECADES. THE REDUCTION OF THE POPULATION HAS BEEN FROM A VARIETY OF REASONS ONE OF THE EARLY RELEASES WE'VE HAD OVER TWENTY THOUSAND RELEASED BETWEEN JULY FIRST OF NOVEMBER FIFTH. WAS MANY OF THOSE WERE EARLY RELEASES OUT OF OUR INSTITUTIONS FROM A VARIETY OF METHODS. WE DID A TWELFTH MONTH EARLY RELEASE FOR ALL OF THOSE AT VERY SPECIFIC HIGH RISK INSTITUTIONS AND WE ADDED A FEW INSTITUTIONS THAT HAD A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF HIGH RISK INMATES. BUT NOT NECESSARILY IT DOESN'T HIGH RISK INSTITUTION. IN ADDITION WE ARE CONTINUING SIX MONTHS EARLY RELEASE FOR- ALL OFFENDERS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEX OFFENDERS. AND OF THE WE ALSO APPLY TO TWELVE MONTH POSITIVE PROGRAMMING CREDIT TO ALL OFFENDERS WERE DISCIPLINARY FREE DURING A VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT A TIME SO YOU KNOW THE MARCH TO JULY TIME FRAME THEY HAD TO BE DISCIPLINARY FREE AND THEY RECEIVE TWELVE WEEKS AFTER SENSE WHICH EQUATES TO EIGHTY FOUR DAYS EVERYBODY RECEIVE THAT THERE WERE NO RESTRICTIONS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LIFE WITHOUT POSSIBILITY PAROLE AND CONTEMPT. OFFENDERS ALL OF THAT HAS DRASTICALLY REDUCED OUR POPULATION WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. IN ADDITION- WE ALSO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATIONAND THE COUNTY JAILS. TO AFFORD THOSE OFFENDERS WHO HAVE A- A SHORTER SENTENCE THEIR TWELVE WEEK CREDITS WHILE THEY'RE IN COUNTY JAIL- TO BE ABLE TO AND APPLY ANY ANY ANY PART OF ANY TYPE OF. GOOD CONDUCT CREDIT EARNING TO THEM SO THEY CAN RELEASE FROM THE GELS VERSUS COMING TO US AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASING. SO WE HAD A GREAT RESPONSE WITH THAT WE'VE ASKED THE COUNTIES TO SEND US ALL OF THEIR CASES THAT THEY THINK ARE WITHIN TWO YEARS AND SO CASE RECORDS ARE STILL PROCESS IN THOSE CASES. IF THE COUNTY HAS A CASE THAT THEY FEEL LIKE IS UP FOR IT- IMMINENT RELEASE WE IMMEDIATELY PROCESS OF THEIR PAPERWORK TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN GET THEM OUT TIMELY. IN ADDITION- I CURRENTLY- AND CLARK IS HE EXPRESSED CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO OUR TYPES OF HOUSING SO OBVIOUSLY WITH IT. SALAS CELL FRIENDS MATTER PHYSICAL PLANT MATTERS ARE OPEN DORMS DESIGN VERSES ARE OPEN CELL FRIENDS VERSES ARE SALAS CELL DOORS ALL THAT MATTERS AND GOES INTO. HOW WE HOW WE MANAGE OUR POPULATION RIGHT NOW IN OUR DORM SETTINGS WE ARE AT 81% CAPACITY WHICH IS VERY VERY LOW- IT'S THE LOWEST I'VE EVER SEEN IT HONESTLY IN MY CAREER. UP I WILL SAY WE'RE WORKING WITH THE RECEIVERS OFFICE TO OFFER HOUSING TRANSFERS OF INMATES THAT ARE CONSIDERED HIGH RISK FOR COGINT FROM A DORM CITING TO A CELL ITSELF AREN'T SETTING. UNDERSTAND MOST OF THE OFFENDERS AND THE LOWER OPEN DORM SETTINGS HAVE REDUCED OUR POINTS DOWN TO WHERE THEY NO LONGER REQUIRE CELL HOUSING. BUT WE ARE OFFERING THEM TELL HOUSING FOR THEIR HEALTH. SO THAT IS STILL ONGOING. ANOTHER EFFORT OF THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IS THAT THE TESTING AND- BOTH ARE INMATES AS WELL AS OUR STAFF HAS BEEN VERY VERY ROBUST WE DO SERIAL TESTING. AND REYES- PUTS THE RIGHT WORKFORCE NOT RANDOM TESTING THAT A SURVEILLANCE TEST AND THAT'S THE WORD THANK YOU. WE DO SURVEILLANCE TESTING OF ALL OF OUR STAFF AS WELL AS THE POPULATION. AND WE'VE DONE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND TESTS. IN OUR SYSTEM AND- WELL ACCORDING TO MY STAFF TWICE IN THE AVERAGE AROUND AND THE KEEP IT I THINK IN THE NATION. BUT I WILL SAY THAT BECAUSE OF OUR- TEST OF OUR STAFF WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY EARLY IF THERE'S AN AND A POTENTIAL OUTBREAK. UNFORTUNATELY OUR OUTBREAKS ALSO NEAR WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY SO WE MONITOR THAT VERY VERY CLOSELY- SO IT AS CLARK SAID WE DO STAFF TESTING AND CONTACT TRACING. FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR POSITIVE CASES TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THOSE CASES- WHO IT THEY POTENTIALLY EXPOSED DURING THAT TIME. WE HAD EVEN THOUGH ROBUST SCREENING SO MANY STAFF ARE. A SYMPTOMATIC SO THE COMING TO WORK AND THEY JUST DON'T KNOW THAT THEIR THAT THEY'RE SECOND TO WE TEST THEM SO. I WILL SAY WE'VE COME A LONG WAY WITH THAT WE HAVE FOLLOWED THAT THE GUIDANCE FROM. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CDC AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS AND C. C. H. C. S. WE ARE IN LOCKSTEP TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE- DOING AMPLE TESTING OF OUR STAFF AS WELL AS OUR VENDORS- AND I WILL SAY EARLY ON THAT EVERYBODY STRUGGLES WITH THE TEST RESULTS- THERE WERE THERE WAS A TIME EARLY ON IN CODED WHERE. IT WAS TAKING TEN TO FOURTEEN DAYS AGO TEST RESULTS WELL NOW WE'RE DOING TESTING EVERY SEVEN DAYS- SAME AS THE NURSING HOMES THAT VERY SPECIFIC INSTITUTIONS. AND SO I WILL SAY THAT OUR TEST TURN AROUND TIMES HAVE REDUCED TO TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS SO REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE- IT'S IN OUR IN OUR TESTING THROUGH THESE VIGOROUS TESTING PROTOCOLS COMBINED WITH THE VARIOUS CHANGES IN SCREENING AT ENTRANCES. CONTACT TRACING. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GAIN A BETTER- CONTROL OF THE OUTBREAK- WE STILL STRUGGLE AS AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A THOUSAND CURRENT CASES WE WERE ALL VERY EXCITED WE'RE AT THREE HUNDRED AND WE SLOWLY SEE ARE RISING- I TRY TO GO OUT TO OUT BRAKE INSTITUTIONS MYSELF TO MONITOR TO MAKE SURE THAT STAFF ARE COMPLYING WITH- ALL THE RULES AND REGULATIONS AS IT RELATES TO PROPER PPE. FEEDING PROTOCOLS AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS- SURVEIL ARE THE WE DO TWICE A DAY NURSING ASSESSMENTS HEALTH CARE DOES IS WE'VE COME OFF WE'VE DEFINITELY COME A LONG WAY. C. CURRENTLY ATTEND OF OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN COATED FREE OF AND ANOTHER ELEVEN HAVE LESS THAN FIVE CASES. AND A CLOSE AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC COUNTLESS HOURS FROM ALL OF OUR STAFF AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OUR STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITYSPEAK TODAY AND WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU RESTORED OFF WITH MR COOPER. STE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MY FIRST QUESTIONS ARE FOR- MISS ALLISON SO YOU GOT THIRTY FIVE PRISONS- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT I'M GETTING READING THIS YOU'VE GOT THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT WARDENS AND REALLY THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT POLICY SO. NO MATTER WHICH FACILITYI WOULD I WOULD GO TO TODAY RIGHT NOW. WITH THE SCREENING PROCESS BE THE SAME. SO THEY'RE ALLOWED VARIANTS DEPENDING UPON THEIR PHYSICAL PLANT DESIGN- SO SOME OF THE OLDER INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN ABILITY TO- SCREEN OUTSIDE THE SECURITY PERIMETER. SOME HAVE ABILITY JUST SCREAM AT THE GUARD SHACK COMING IN IT JUST DEPENDS UPON THEIR INDIVIDUAL PHYSICAL PLANT DESIGN. BUT THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR PLANS HAD BEEN APPROVED BY OUR HEADQUARTERS THE C. C. H. C. S. AS WELL AS- THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS HAD APPROVED EACH OF THEIR PLANS TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR CONSISTENCY PURPOSES. OKAY AND I KNOW YOU WERE LAST YEAR YOU SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER OF MR KELSO MAY HAVE NOT RELAXING THE- GUIDELINES FOR FACE REQUIREMENTS FOR STAFF AND INMATES. BACK IN JUNE WHAT IS THAT REQUIREMENT TODAY ON WEARING FACE MASK IT HAS SINCE CHANGED SO THAT THE CHANGE IN JUNE. HAD TO BE RELATED TO OUTSIDE SO THERE WAS AT THAT TIME. AND OF COURSE WE'VE ALL OF ALL. PEOPLE THERE WAS A FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE THAT IT WAS FINE IF YOU WERE OUTDOORS AND COULD- HAVE SIX. FEET DISTANCE THAT AMOUNTS WAS NOT REQUIRED SO WE DID ALLOW THAT WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS. OF THAT HAS SINCE CHANGED SO THEY ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR A MOUSE THE ONLY TIME. THAT THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO WEAR A MASK IS IF THEY'RE IN AN OFFICE BY THEMSELVES WITH SOLID DOORS. OF THAT THEY COULD CLOSE- IF SOMEBODY WERE TO INTO THEIR OFFICE THEY NEED TO DON A MASK. OR IF THEY'RE IN THE TOWER AGAIN ALONE. WE DID ALLOW THEM WHEN THEY'RE RUN INTO AN ALARM BECAUSE IT'S HARD WHEN YOU'RE BREATHING HEAVILY THROUGH A MASK. TO BE ABLE TO THE TO PULL IT DOWN WHILE YOU'RE RUNNING IMMEDIATELY- PUT IT OUT SO THOSE WERE THAT THE MOST RECENT CHANGES. THAT WE MADE TO OUR VAST POLICY. AND WHAT IS A COMPLIANCE ON INMATES WAS PURSUED AFTER THE ALL FOLLOWING. THE PROGRAM OR SOME ARE SOME AREN'T. WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING TO SENDING YET ANOTHER DIRECTIVE OUT TO THE INMATE POPULATION. I MEAN IT'S A STRUGGLE A LOT OF THEM LISTEN TO THE NEWS SOMETIMES THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT- I WILL SAY WHEN I WALK INSTITUTIONS THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE WEARING THEM UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES ARE BELOW THE NOSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF COVERING THE NOSE. AND SO JUST CONSTIPATED PATIENT EDUCATION AS IT RELATES TO. PROPERLY WEARING OF YOUR MASK SO WHAT HAPPENS TO ME DOESN'T WEAR HIS MASK WOOD WHAT DO YOU DO WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM. THEY COULD GO THROUGH PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE. WE'VE TRIED NOT TO DO THAT YET BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW IT WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE RIGHT THIS IS THEIR HOME. THEY DON'T SEE IT THE SAME WAY WE DO BUT WE HAVE TOLD THEM THROUGH PATIENT EDUCATION AND THERE WERE IN THE PROCESS OF DRAFTING A MEMO FOR CONSIDERATION FOR. POTENTIAL DISCIPLINE FOR NON COMPLIANCE WELL I GUESS WE'RE NINE MONTHS INTO THIS ALREADY IN THIS PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT MASK SAVE LIVES. WERE DISAPPOINTING STAFF NON SWORN AND NON SWORN COULD NOT WEARING A MASK AND YET WE'RE STILL RUNNING MAMMALS FOR THE INMATES. THAT HEY YOU SHOULD WEAR MASKING CALLING THEM AT SOME POINT. YOU KNOW WE SEEM BUT I'VE GOT WATER GOVERNOR SAID ON TV'S. WHAT THE- POSITIONS THE SAID YOU NEED TO WEAR A MASK SO I WOULD THINK WE'RE FURTHER OR FAR BEYOND THAT POINT. WE'RE STILL GOING TO SUGGESTED THAT YOU WHERE ARE YOU COULD DISCIPLINE FOR IT. IN THIS PRIVILEGES. SUBS FOR AND FIGURE OUT NINE LISTEN. TO THIS. WHY ARE WE STILL. WRITING MEMOS PAPERS. FOR THESE FOLKS. FOR THE MOST RECENT DEMO IS TO TAKE. AND DISCIPLINARY MEASURES IT HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED YET. OKAY WELL I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE FAR TO THIS AND EVERYONE KNOWS. KILEY LAN AND I'M SURE MAMMALS HAVE BEEN SET UP BEFORE. AND THEY'VE GOTTEN EDUCATION MATERIALS THROUGH YOU. AND THROUGH MR KELSO'S OFFICE. SO THEY'VE BEEN TOLD ABOUT THIS NUMEROUS TIMES CORRECT. YES OKAY AND IT'S JUST IT'S JUST AND I GUESS THE OTHER ISSUE IS I KNOW CCAR. PART OF THE ISSUE WITH WITH IT'S JUST CONSISTENCY WITH THIRTY FIVE PRESENTS THERE'S A LOT OF AUTONOMY THERE A LITTLE THEIR AGENCIES LARGE AGENCIES THAT WERE IT'S MORE TOP DOWN MANAGEMENT HOW YOU WILL DO THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL AND I KNOW THAT C. C. R. GIVES A LOT OF LEEWAY. THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO SOME OF THESE THINGS IN THE PRISONS ARE YOU TRYING TO MORE RATED IN IT AND WE'RE WHAT I'M SAYING BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE SECRETARY SO THE BOOKS MAPS OF THE BOOK. THE BUCK STOPS WITH YOU. I'M NOT ABSOLUTE. YEAH SO AND I WILL SAY THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF OUR CALL ON FRIDAY WAS TO MAKE SURE IT WAS. CRYSTAL CLEAR WHAT THE EXPECTATION WAS. OF WITH OUR INSTITUTIONS I MEAN I'M TIRED OF RIGHT TO SIGN MY NAME TO MEMOS. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY ANSWER. TO ASK QUESTIONS. OF AND BOTH CLARK AND I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT OUR MESSAGE WAS LOUD AND CLEAR. BUT IT STILL COMES BACK AND I'M NOT A BELIEVER THE POINT. WE'RE STILL NINE MONTHS INTO THIS AND WE'RE STILL DOING ALL THIS STUFF. WHICH SHOULD'VE OCCURRED QUITE A BIT OF TIME AGO. BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IT THROUGH ITS NEST AND HOSPITALS AND- YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY TIGHT ON IT. EVEN THE CAPITAL I MEAN. YOU JUST HAVE TO CHECK GO TO WEAR MASKS. THE LAWLER STUFF IS MIND NUMBING BECAUSE- YOU HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE MULTIPLE FOR MONITORS OR THE BATTERY GOES OUT. YOU'VE GOT. TO DO THAT SO. SOME OF THE STUFF I'M HEARING IS LAUGHABLE. THAT PEOPLE CAN'T GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER ON THIS. BECAUSE IF YOU CAN SCREEN SOMEONE ENTRANCED LIKE IF YOU HAVE A FLASHLIGHT YOU HAVE EXTRA BATTERIES IT'S JUST THINGS LIKE THAT. WE'RE IT'S AND I WILL SAY THIS. YOU KNOW I THINK C. R. C. C. R. CONTRIBUTED SOME THESE ISSUES- I'M NOT GONNA BLAME YOU WELL MAYBE I. DON'T KNOW. BUT THROUGH THE- THROUGH MANAGEMENT. AND IT THAT THAT THAT'S THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART THAT WE'RE IN THIS. AND EVERYONE SHOULD WEAR A MASK AND PERIOD IF THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL IF YOU DON'T. GET THERE'S GONNA BE REPERCUSSIONS. BUT IT'S JUST THAT'S FRUSTRATION. IS A LOT OF COULD HAVE BEEN PER. WITH AND EVEN DOWN THE TREE. OF THE INMATES THAT WERE NEVER TESTED IT'S JUST. IT IT'S SO SAD THIS COMICAL NOTHING COMICAL. THAT HOW WE CHANGE THIS AND REALLY GET IT BACK- I THINK IT IS TOUGH FOR YOU GUYS BECAUSE YOU'RE FACILITIES. THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL PLANT. YOU GOT A LOT OF ALL FACILITIES THAT ARE CONDUCIVE FOR IT- THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR DO NOT WANT TO BUILD PRISONS THEY WANNA CLOSE PRISONS. THE PROBLEM IS. WE'VE GOT A B. ONE OH NINE PROP 47-57. WHEN YOU KNOW AND I KNOW WHO'S LEFT IN PRISON. VIA THE FENDERS. IS THAT CORRECT. THERE WE CAN PRODUCE SURE A TOTAL OF FULL OUTBREAK OF OUR POPULATION BUT YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MANY NOT NON- VIOLENT LIKE SAY SECOND STRIKERS THAT WE HAVE IN THOSE TYPE OF THINGS BUT FOR THE MOST PART WE DO HAVE A FAIR NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENDERS WITHIN OUR FACILITIES RIGHT. AND ALSO WE KNOW OBVIOUSLY THAT SOME NONVIOLENT CRIMES OR IF YOU'RE DOING A WOMAN INTO HAVING A CHILD YOU CONSIDER NON VIOLENT CRIMES BUT IT STILL GOES BACK TO- IS MR KELSO SAID THERE WILL BE MORE OUTBREAKS AT SOME POINT LATER ON AND HOW DO WE FIX THIS AND WE DON'T FIX IT IN THE CURRENT SET UP WITH PRISONS- THERE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS LEAPT IS GONE BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS. WHERE THEY CAN BUILD MUCH BETTER FACILITY BUT NO ONE WANTS TO DO IT SO- I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU I KNOW YOU'RE A TOUGH SITUATION AS THE SECRETARY- DOING SOME OF THE ISSUES IT'S THE. HAND YOU'RE DEALT WITH. BUT AS WOULD JUST LIKE TO SEE JUST MORE IN YOUR TOP DOWN HE- HAS OVER GOING TO DO IS NOT OPTIONAL AND- AND QUIT GIVING SO MUCH TO TALK TO ME- TO THE WARDENS BECAUSE MY OPINION THEY HAVE TOO MUCH. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAD A QUESTION FOR CDC ARE- IN THE STATEWIDE POPULATIONS- WE'VE SEEN SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS WITH EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AS A RESULT OF THE LACK F SOCIAL INTERACTION- IMPOSED BY SOME OF OUR SHUT DOWNS- IN RESPONSE THE PANDEMIC AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY DATA ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON IN MADE THE MOTIONAL MENTAL HEALTH THAT THE LACK OF VISITATION HAS CAUSED AND I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE- THE YOUTH TOWARD. POPULATION WELL AS FAR AS DATA I MAY HAVE TO- DIFFER OR GET YOU SOME DATA ON THAT SIDE I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE IF THERE'S ACTUAL DATA I WILL JUST SAY IT IS ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING. THAT OURVENDORS HAVE NOT HAD FACE TO FACE VISITING. SINCE MARCH. AND IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT THE HOLIDAYS ARE COMING IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN HARDER. WE'RE WORKING VERY VERY HARD WE WERE HOPING TO OPEN UP FOR FACE TO FACE VISITING. IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE AND UNFORTUNATELY AS OF YESTERDAY. I WAS INFORMED THAT THAT WILL NOT BE HAPPENING AND BASED ON HEALTH CARE'S RECOMMENDATION PUBLIC HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS. WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD VERY FAST TO GET AN ELECTRONIC SOLUTION SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY. FOR FAMILIES- I WILL SAY THAT ON OUR JUVENILE SIDE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THAT FAIRLY EARLY ON A COVERT I COULDN'T RECALL THE EXACT DATE I WANT TO SAY IT WAS APRIL TIME FRAME MAYBE MAY THE WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO DO SKYPE BUSY NOW THEIR POPULATION IS MUCH MUCH LOWER THAN OURS. BUT I HAVE GIVEN A REALLY HARD DEADLINE THAT I EXPECT THIS IS IT THIS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE IF NOT IF I HAVE TO REACH OUT TO ANOTHER STATE AGENCY LIKE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY FOR SOME SUPPORT I'VE DEFINITELY PREPARED TO DO THAT IF MY IF INTERNALLY WE KEEP WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET VISITING I WILL SAY THAT OUR MENTAL HEALTH. PARTNERS HAVE BEEN VERY DILIGENT WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO OUR OFFENDERS IN OUR CARE- BECAUSE IT'S VERY IT'S- IT'S- IT'S BEEN DRAMATIC I WILL SAY WE WERE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE OUR PHONE CALLS. WE ALSO HAVE FREE PHONE CALL DAYS. OF BY OUR VENDOR THAT PROVIDES OUR PHONE CALLS THEY OFFERED I WANT TO SAY IT'S AN AVERAGE OF TWO DAYS PER MONTH THAT I COULDN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHICH DAYS THEY ARE. BUT THEY'RE TOTALLY FREE CALLS. AND SO THAT HAS CERTAINLY HELPED THE POPULATION. THAT WAS REALLY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE CAME UP WITH THE TWELVE WEEK POSITIVE PROGRAMMING CREDIT. WAS TO REALIZE THAT THE POPULATION HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY KOVIC YOU AND I ARE IMPACTED EVERY DAY. BY NOT BY OUR DAY TO DAY LIVES BUT THEY DON'T BUT WE HAVE OUR FAMILIES THEY DON'T. AND SO IT'S THAT WAS ONE OF OUR THOUGHT PROCESSES THAT THEY BEHAVED. THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR FAMILY THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR VISITS THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROGRAM IS THAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY HAVE. IN SO THAT'S WHERE WE KIND OF CAME UP WITH THE WHOLE THOUGHT PROCESS OF PASTA PROGRAMMING CREDIT. AND SO IT'S SOMETHING NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. AND I WANT TO GET IT FIXED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO ENSURE. THAT FOR THE MIDDLE HEALTH AS WELL AS JUST THEIR BASIC WELL BEING- THE LONELINESS OF KOPET RIGHT THAT'S A REALITY IT'S LONELY- WHEN YOU CAN'T LIVE YOUR NORMAL LIFE SINCE SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO BOB THANK YOU I'M GIVEN- YOU KNOW I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS SOMETHING YOU GIVEN SOME THOUGHT TO AS WELL. I'M WONDERING I MEAN OBVIOUSLY. THE RESTRICTIONS ON VISITATION OF SOMETHING THAT HAD TO BE IMPLEMENTED TO TRY AND STOP THE SPREAD OF. THE VIRUS FROM OUTSIDE THE INSTITUTIONS INTO THE INSTITUTIONS BUT- I'M WONDERING OF RAPID TESTING HAS BEEN LOOKED AT AS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO GETTING. SOME VISITATION GOING AGAIN BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THAT'S NOT FROM A MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE THE MOST ACCURATE OF TESTED SEEM LIKE TO BE A USEFUL SCREENING TOOL. TO ALLOW THESE VISITATIONS TO TAKE PLACE. I KNOW THAT WE'VE WORKED VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS AND WE HAVE AMAZING STAFF I COLOR MY- MY BFF MY BEST BEST FRIEND FOREVER. BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW OUR DOCTOR OUR SO WELL AND I THINK SHE TESTIFIED LAST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND SHE'S PHENOMENAL. ALONG WITH DOCTOR BACK- WILL BE UP HERE SHORTLY ADDRESSING THAT. AND I DID GET THE FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I I'M NOT A 100% SURE IF THEY LOOKED AT RAPID TESTING. I WILL SAY THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF THE ANTIGENS THAT THE ACTUAL TEST KITS THEMSELVES HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN PROBLEMATIC TO ATTAIN. A AND OPEN UP THOSE FOR VISITING I DON'T I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW IF THEY ASSESS THAT BUT I THINK DOCTOR BIG SEASON AUDIENCE. AND WILL BE SPEAKING AT. SHORTLY ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU IT SOUNDS LIKE MORE OF THE SAME OPINION OF THIS BUT- IF WE AGREE THAT. OUR GOAL HERE IS REHABILITATION. THEN I IT IT'S CLEARLY COUNTER PURPOSE TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. TWO OUT TO PREVENT THIS VISITATION FROM TAKING PLACE AND- I FOR ONE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE US GET TO A POINT WHERE. WE CAN RESTORE THOSE VISITATION. RIGHTS TO THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR. THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU MAY LIVING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HI SECRETARY ALISON IT'S NICE TO SEE VIRTUALLY AGAIN WE DON'T YEAH WE DON'T GET TO MEET A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE DURING THE PANDEMIC SO I APPRECIATE- THE ACCESSIBILITY THAT YOU'VE HAD FOR. US AND FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY DID I DID WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOU'D MENTIONED NOT WANTING TO DIED. COMMENT ON THE COURTS- DECISION BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT- THE VOLUNTARY TRANSFER. A CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAVE AND IN PARTICULAR. AT SAN QUENTIN BUT ALSO HOT AS IT APPLIES TO OTHER. FACILITIES IT SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU'VE YOU'VE OFFERED TRANSFER TO PEOPLE AND THEY THEY DECLINE IT. AND I UNDERSTAND THE SAN QUENTIN IS A DESIRABLE- FACILITY FOR THE INCARCERATED BECAUSE OF THE ACCESS TO REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. IS THE TRANSFERRED DECLINE RATE AT SAN QUENTIN DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FACILITIES OR OR- IS IT MORE IN LINE WITH OTHER FACILITIES IN THE SYSTEM. I WILL SAY WERE SUCH IN THE INFANCY STAGE OF OFFERING THOSE TRANSFERS I DON'T THINK I COULD BARELY ANSWER THAT QUESTION. BUT AS WE GO FORWARD- I WILL ENSURE THAT WE TRACK SOME DATA ON THOSE. OKAY YEAH THANK YOU WE'VE WE'VE ALSO HEARD ABOUT YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO DOCTOR BURKE. VERY EARLY ON YEARS AGO COMMENTING ON HOW PRISON DESIGN IS NOT MADE WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH- PERSPECTIVE. AND THAT THERE CERTAINLY ARE INVESTMENTS THAT MUST BE MADE AT PRISONS LIKE FOLSOM AND SAN QUENTIN THAT ARE ANTIQUATED- BUT ALSO OTHER PRISONS THAT ARE MORE DORM LIKE IN THEIR SETTING WHICH- FROM A- PRISON MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE MAY BE DESIRABLE IN IN MODERN THINKING. AS OPPOSED TO HOW WE TREATED PEOPLE IN THE PAST WHAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT WOULD NEED TO BE MADE SYSTEM WIDE. TO YOU KNOW BETTER PREPARE FOR. AND DOMINIC'S AND IN FACT JUST AT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WERE NEVER PROBABLY GONNA GO BACK TO A NORMAL- WITH REGARD TO- HOW WE NEED TO HOUSE PRISONERS THERE AND BUT THE POPULATION OF THE INCARCERATED SHOULD BE. OBVIOUSLY AS I SAID EARLIER I DO THINK PHYSICAL PLANT MATTERS YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE WITHIN OUR FACILITIES IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL. YOU KNOW I'M JUST. I WILL SAY THAT FORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT AT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND OFFENDERS WHEN CO THAT HIT. A TRIPLE BONTA GEMS AND ALL OF OUR HOUSING UNITS. OF OUR OPEN DOOR HOUSING UNITS SPECIFICALLY- YOU KNOW FORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT THERE- IN OUR POPULATION HAS DRASTICALLY DROP SINCE REALIGNMENT PROPOSITION. THIRTY SIX FORTY SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN. DRASTIC REDUCTIONS IN OUR POPULATION. SO THAT IS FORTUNATE- I WILL SAY THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO SOME LONG TERM ASSESSMENTS ALL AS FAR AS OUR FACILITIES. OF THE OPEN CELL FRONT DESIGNS THE- VERSUS ALL ITSELF FRONT WE KNOW THAT THAT MATTERS IN A PANDEMIC- WE ALSO KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW OPEN DORM SETTINGS THAT. YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN GET SOME DISTANCE IN BETWEEN THAT MATTERS AS WELL SO OBVIOUSLY ALL OF THAT GOES INTO CONSIDERATION AND IF THERE'S ANY. IT STILL HAS TO BE ASSESSED AS FAR AS OUR ABILITY AND- YOU KNOW HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLACE LIKE SEGWIT LET'S SAY OR FULSOME. RIGHT I MEAN MAYBE YOU YOU UTILIZE LOWER RISK POPULATION. VERSUS A HIGHER RISK MEDICAL POPULATION- MAYBE THAT'S AN OPTION I MEAN WE STILL HAVE TO EVALUATE ALL THE OPTIONS GO GOING FORWARD NOW WE HAVE SINCE STOPPED. ALL HIGH RISK IN TAKEN TO SEGWIT WITH EXAMPLE QUITS PROBABLY STILL CLOSED. TO ANY KIND OF INTAKE BUT DEFINITELY HIGH RISK MEDICAL INTAKE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY THE COMBINATION OF HIGH RISK MEDICAL. PLUS THE PHYSICAL PLANT SO THAT'S REALLY THE BIGGEST COMBINATION AND THEN. DECISION MAKING SO FISCAL PLAN TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY CHANGE AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WE'RE WE NEED TO PUT THOSE INVESTMENTS- TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. THOSE ARE STILL UNDER EVALUATION OKAY THANK YOU. THE EARLY ON IT AND TO RAISE DR BURKE'S NAME AGAIN I SPOKE WITH HIM IN APRIL ASKING FOR SITE SPECIFIC PLANS FOR ALL OF OUR PRISON FACILITIES TO PLAN- IN ANTICIPATION OF- AN OUTBREAK OF KOBE NINETEEN WITHIN OUR PRISON SYSTEM IN EACH OF THE THIRTY FIVE FACILITIES. I WAS REFERRED TO I THINK AN EIGHTY FOUR PAGE SYSTEM WIDE PLAN BUT THERE IS NOTHING SPECIFIC TO ANY PARTICULAR FACILITY OR PRISON. IN CALIFORNIA- AND SO I NEVER REALLY HEARD OF ANY PLAN ALTHOUGH I CALLED FOR IT- PRETTY MUCH SHOT. INCESSANTLY SINCE APRIL UNTIL JULY WHEN YES- LANDED UPON SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON AND CREATED- YOU KNOW TENTS TO CREATE A SPACE FOR PHYSICAL DISTANCE IN. AS WELL AS A PLAN FOR AN ALTERNATE CARE SITES TO ALLEVIATE PRESSURE ON LOCAL HOSPITALS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH. LEVEL OF HOSPITALIZATION OF THE INCARCERATED. IN LOCAL BAY AREA HOSPITALS. AND SO IN IN THE PRIOR CONVERSATION THIS TWO OF US HAD. YOU HAD SURE THAT EVERY PRISON FACILITY NOW HAS BEEN. MEASURED IN SIZE STOP AND THE TYPES OF TENTS THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND SPACES FOR ALTERNATE CARE HAVE BEEN EVALUATED AND SO ALL THIRTY FIVE. PRISON FACILITIES DO HAVE PLANS TO MANAGE AND MITIGATE AND AN OUTBREAK OF COVER NINETEEN. SO WE'VE IDENTIFIED ISOLATION QUARANTINE SPACES THAT EACH AND EVERYONE OF OUR THIRTY FIVE FACILITIES. IN ADDITION TO VERY SPECIFIC FACILITIES WE'VE HAD FIRE MARSHAL AS WELL AS ATTEND MANUFACTURE GO OUT AND PROVIDE ASSESSMENT SO WHERE THEY PUT. AN ALTERNATE HOUSING SITE FORTUNATELY THE MAJORITY OF OUR GYM SPACES AROUND THE STATE HAVE HAVE NO LONGER- ARE NOT OCCUPIED FOR CURRENT HOUSING BUT ARE AVAILABLE FOR HOUSING. A POTENTIAL OPTIONS SO- THERE ARE CONTINGENCY PLANS I WILL SAY EARLY ON ALL OF US- WE'RE ALL FOLLOWING THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL GUIDELINES AS IT RELATED TO- PRISONS AND JAILS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM BUT I WILL SAY THAT WE'VE EVEN LEARN MORE. THAN WHAT THAT THAT ORIGINAL GUIDANCE HAT AND MANY STATES LOOK TO US FOR THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED I GET CALLS FREQUENTLY. ON HOW HOW ARE YOU GUYS HOW ARE YOU HANDLING COBIT IN YOUR SYSTEM- SO WE SHARE ALL OF OUR LESSONS. LEARNED WITH AROUND THE NATION. HI YOU SECOND. ON ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT REALLY WAS A CONCERN EARLY ON THIS IS WHY I SPOKE WITH CDCR IN APRIL AND KEPT ON WAVING- WARNING FLAGS ABOUT THIS WAS THE- CONCERN FOR HOSPITALIZATION NOT JUST BECAUSE OF AN OUTBREAK IN PRISONS BUT SO THAT WAS A CONCERN NATIONWIDE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD ENOUGH I SEE USE ENOUGH. VENTILATORS THIS WAS A MASSIVE CONCERN GLOBALLY AND- AND SO ALONG WITH MEASURING FOR TENTS AND CARE SITES AND QUARANTINE- IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A HOSPITALIZATION PLAN AS- MISTER TEEN HAD NOTED- THE INCARCERATED FROM SAN QUENTIN ENDED UP. GOING TO HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA PRIMARILY- OF COURSE IN THE NORTH BAY BUT ALSO IN IN MR KING'S DISTRICT AND THEN OF COURSE SPREAD ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS THERE A PLAN FOR HOSPITALIZATION FOR EACH OF THE THIRTY FIVE FACILITIES. I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO EITHER MR KELSO OR DOCTOR BACK ON THAT ISSUE I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A VERY. STRONG UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT UNIT THAT HAS ALL THE BEDS AVAILABLE AROUND THE STATE BUT IT'S REALLY NOT FOR ME TO DISCUSS THAT OKAY I'D BE GLAD TO HEAR FROM THEM ABOUT THAT- IT. ADDITIONALLY. AND I WANNA I WANNA MAYBE I'LL SAVE MY NEXT COMMENT FOR WHEN MR KELSO APPEARS AGAIN THANK YOU. OKAY OKAY SO HE'S- MISTER TIM JUST TOLD ME I'M I'M ABLE TO ASK. WHILE YOU'RE ON THAT THE CAMERA SO THAT'S FINE. MR CALL SO HAD- STATED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS. ABOUT HIS UNDERSTANDING OF CODED NINETEEN AND KIND OF THE- MEDICAL UNDERSTANDING OF CODE NINETEEN AND HOW IT COULD SPREAD. AND HOW TESTING SHOULD BE CONDUCTED HI HI MR CALLS TO GET TO SEE YOU AGAIN- AND SO I WANTED TO JUST. KIND OF CHECK IN ON THAT THINKING BECAUSE- THAT'S IT'S NOT THE WAY THAT I REMEMBER- OUR UNDERSTANDING OF COVE ED IN PARTICULAR IN PARTICULAR. THOSE WITH EXPERTISE EXPERTISE IN EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND SO I REMEMBER EXTRAORDINARILY VIVIDLY THE NIGHT OF THE TRANSFER TO SAN QUENTIN FROM CHINO- I WAS IN THE STATE CAPITAL LATE THAT EVENING- I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM MY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER FOR MARIN COUNTY DR MATT WILLIS WHO'S BEEN. A GUIDING LIGHT ON UNDERSTANDING COVET NINETEEN FOR ME AND FOR MANY IN MY COMMUNITY AND HE HE UNDERSTOOD THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION- THAT NIGHT AS PEOPLE WERE COMING IN- ON THE BUSES SYMPTOMATIC. AND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT TESTS HAD NOT OCCURRED FOR WEEKS. AND THE DANGER THAT THIS SPARK. WOULD CREATE AT THE DISTANT INCREDIBLE AN UNMANAGEABLE WILDFIRE IN FACT DR WILSON'S CONCERNS BECAUSE OF THE SCIENCE BEHIND HIM TO UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE BEHIND COVER NINETEEN. WORD THE MOTIVATION BETWEEN BUT BEHIND MY EARLY CALLS FOR PLANNING BACK IN APRIL BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD HOW CODE NINETEEN COULD SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE AND SO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUSH BACK MR KELSO ON YOUR COMMENTS NOT A TESTING PROTOCOLS- IN UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER OR NOT- VAPOR DROPLETS VERSUS- SOLICITATION- WERE UNDERSTOOD WELL BECAUSE WHEN I TALK TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER I TRUSTED BACK THEN HE UNDERSTOOD IT QUITE CLEARLY. WELL THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT ON THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THROUGH MARCH APRIL MAY. JUNE PERHAPS I THINK WHAT THE RECORD SHOWS IS THAT THERE WERE GLOBALLY- ONLY ISOLATED- EXAMPLES WHERE YOU COULD SAY WELL THAT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BY DROPLETS SPREAD. I THINK EVERYBODY MAY RECALL THERE WAS A ON AN EXAMPLE OF A SPREAD IN A RESTAURANT. WHERE THE PERSON WENT UP AFFECTED WAS. ACROSS THE RESTAURANT AND I HAD OTHERWISE HAD NO CONTACT. BUT THE NOTION OF SUPERSPRINT OR EVENTS I WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS BEING- DISCUSSED WIDELY- IN MARCH APRIL MAY UP. AND I GUESS ALTHOUGH WHAT I. IT'S FAIR FOR ME TO SAY I DIDN'T MAKE THIS UP IN TERMS OF WHAT'S THE- THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE SPREAD OF CODE I'M RELYING UPON AND WAS THEN RELYING UPON ADVICE OF OUR TOP MEDICAL LEADERSHIP. INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS- I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AEROSOL SPREAD. OUT BUT I SIMPLY DON'T- MY RECOLLECTION IS DIFFERENT THAN YOURS- MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT AT LEAST AS OF MAY THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS WIDELY RECOGNIZED- IN ANY EVENT- THE WEATHER WAS OR WAS NOT WIDELY RECOGNIZED WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN QUENTIN I WAS A DISASTER AND I THINK YOU AND I AGREE ON ON THAT- AND WE NEED TO LEARN THE LESSONS FROM THAT. UP GOING BACK YOUR HOSPITALIZATION QUESTION THE QUICK ANSWER THERE IS YES WE HAVE FOR EACH INSTITUTION THEY UNDERSTAND WHERE. THEIR HOSPITAL RESOURCES ARE. EVEN WITH CENTERPOINT THE FOR THAT WE MOVE TO A HOUSE UP ALONG THE I. EIGHTY CORDER- THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS A PART OF A- OF A PLAN FOR WHEN YOU HAVE THIS NUMBER OF HOSPITALIZATIONS YOU DON'T WANNA OVER BURDEN- EVERYBODY IN THE BAY AREA. YOU HAVE TO START MOVING UP THE CORNER- MA'AM WE MONITOR AVAILABILITY OF HOSPITAL BEDS AND ICU BEDS ARE PRETTY MUCH ON A DAILY BASIS- BECAUSE THAT IS A LIMITING RESOURCE- THAT WE SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY. I THINK THANK YOU MISTER CALCITE I'LL JUST CONTINUE TO PUSH BACK ON THE IDEA THAT WE DIDN'T THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE FREQUENT TESTING AND THAT SAN QUENTIN COULD HAVE BEEN. IN A PROVIDE SERVICE FOR PUTTING ONE TO BE AFTER WITH KOBE NINETEEN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I AGREE WITH YOU THE WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENING WAS TESTING WITH THEM AT THE TIME OF THE MOVE TO SAN QUENTIN. TESTING NO LONGER THAN SEVEN DAYS BEFORE I AGREE WITH THAT COMPLETELY. THE AND THE CURRENT RULE THE CURRENT ROLE WE HAVE IS YOU HAVE TO BE TESTED WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF THE MOVE. I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT POINT THANK YOU AND I AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR RADIC WHAT I CALL RADICALLY CO HOARDING PEOPLE ISOLATING THEM AFTER THOSE TESTS BEFORE ANY TYPE OF MOVEMENT. THE WITH SOMETHING THAT ALARMED ME YOU KNOW LATE STAGES OF THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN AT SAN QUENTIN. WAS THE UTILIZATION OF NINE ONE ONE. TO CALL FOR AN AMBULANCE FOR- FOR EMERGENCIES- AT THE PRISON. AND THAT- IN THAT IT TOOK A WHILE. FOR A MORE REGULAR MANAGEABLE SYSTEM. TO BE UTILIZED- AND INSTITUTED. BESIDES JUST CALLING NINE ONE ONE FOR AN AMBULANCE TO SHOW UP. LET ME LOOK AT DOCTOR BACK HERE WHO IS OVER THE SCREEN- ARE WHAT WE USE NINE ONE ONE ROUTINELY AROUND THE STATE DON'T WE TALKED A BIT. YES. AMERICORPS SURE THERE ARE A REACH THE ZERO ARE. YEAH THAT ACTUALLY BUT THE MAKES A YOU PROBABLY COULDN'T HEAR OF UTILIZATION OF MINE WERE ONE IS WE DO STATE BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BEST WAY OF ENSURING THAT OUR PATIENTS GET- BUT BOTH PROBABLY PICKED UP AND DELIVERED TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM SURE AND IN AT WHAT POINT DO YOU. YOU KNOW CREATE A DIFFERENT SYSTEM A MORE EFFECTIVE SYSTEM BECAUSE AS I UNDERSTOOD THE LOCAL HOSPITALS WERE OVERWHELMED WITH THE CALLS FOR SERVICE LOCAL EMERGENCY FIRST RESPONDERS WERE OVERWHELMED YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE EMERGENCIES ON A DAILY BASIS. IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT THESE AMBULANCES WOULD OTHERWISE BE SERVICE SCENE BUT YOU KNOW TWELVE PLUS TIMES A DAY. GOING TO SAN QUENTIN WAS. A BURDEN BOTH ON THE HOSPITALS BUT ON ON COMMUNITY FIRST RESPONDERS SO HOW DO WE PLAN AND FOR PLANNING FOR HOSPITALIZATION FOR PLANNING FOR. ADEQUATE SPACE SEEN AN ALTERNATE CARE SITES IN OUR PRISON FACILITIES HOW DO WE ALSO PLAN FOR THOSE CALLS FOR FOUR FIRST RESPONDERS IN THESE- HI CALL. IT'S THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND ON THAT ONE I DO WANT TO CONSULT WITH DOCTOR BACK ON AND IT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE THAT RELATES TO OVERALL UTILIZATION OF HOSPITALS AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IS- AND ARE PARTICULARLY VERY LARGE OUTBREAKS SOME OF THEM WE DON'T HAVE VERY :Y HOSPITALIZATIONS AT ALL. OTHERS WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF HOSPITALIZATIONS SURE AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN THAT ARE RIGHT NOW- WE DON'T HAVE A SURGE CAPACITY OTHER VAN NINE ONE ONE. AND WE MAY BE OURSELVES OVERWHELMING THE NINE ONE ONE RESOURCES SO I WON- RAISE THAT ISSUE WITH MY TEAM AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CALL SO THIS WAS A HUGE A MASSIVE CONCERN ONE BECAUSE OF COURSE- SECOND STATE PRISON IS SERVICED BY THE NEAREST HOSPITAL MARIN HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER WHICH WAS. GREATLY OVERBURDENED- WITH VERY FEW FEW BEDS AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY LET ALONE A COMMUNITY SPREAD EVENT AND A PRISON SPREAD EVENT. ABOUT THAT THEY THEN NEEDED TO COORDINATE WITH THE OTHER COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AROUND MARIN COUNTY AND THEN OF COURSE INTO SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY AND- AND OTHER NEIGHBORING. HERBAL COMMUNITY IN IN BOTH IN THE COUNTY BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF AGE ALSO IN IN THE STATE PRISON. THAT PERHAPS IS NOT AS BAD AT OTHER PRISONS OF COURSE WE HAD A HUGE. SPREAD OF KOBE NINETEEN AB AND ALL WHICH DID NOT GET. THE ATTENTION THAT IT PROBABLY DESERVED- FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS- BUT- BUT PERHAPS WHAT DIDN'T HAVE AS HIGH A PERCENTAGE OF MEDICALLY VULNERABLE. PEOPLE WHO- DID END UP WITH COVETED THE THESE HAVE TO BE PART OF. OF THE OF THE HOSPITALIZATION PLANS REACH PRESENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR READY. THANK YOU AND- MY QUESTION IS CAN BE FOR SECRETARY ALLISON BUT I'M GOING TO USE IF I MAY UM RECEIVER KELSO'S- HANDOUT AND WHILE I HAVE YOU FOR A SECOND. MR CAL SO I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN. IT'S A PAINTING MEETING YOU FOR A WHILE I WORK IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE SPACE AND REALLY WANTED TO TALK WITH YOU AT SOME POINT OFFLINE ABOUT HOW WE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF- CALIFORNIANS BUT REALLY WANTED ACTUALLY THANK YOU FOR THE DATA THAT COMES IN YOUR HAND I'M ONE OF THOSE WHO LOVES READING AND GETTING INTO THE DETAILS. AND YOU PROVIDE A LAYER OF GRANULARITY THAT'S ACTUALLY YOUR BOARD THAT I THINK IS QUITE IMPORTANT AND I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS A THEME OR A THOUGHT THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR PAPER WHICH IS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPEN. CELLS AND THOSE THAT ARE CLOSED AND SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN AS THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THOSE OPEN CELLS WE'VE SEEN 81% OF THE DEATHS HAVE OCCURRED IN THOSE CELLS AND 84% OF THE DEATHS PER YEAR DATA HAVE OCCURRED WHEN WE HAVE A CO OP ED REST OR GREATER THAN THREE. NOW YOUR CONCLUSION IS THAT WE SHOULD BE TRANSFERRING THOSE- PEOPLE WHO HAVE COVERED RISK OR GREATER THAN THREE. INTO CLOSED CELLS WHETHER OR NOT THAT AT THE INSTITUTION ARE WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS. AND MY QUESTION FOR SECRETARY ALISON IS. OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BEEN FOLLOWED IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ACTIVELY WORKING ON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DO LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING WITH YOU AND- MY OFFICE WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH YOURS I THINK I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION- THE- CDCR HAS AGREED WITH THE RECOMMENDATION TO- OFFER A MOVE TO THOSE HIGH RISK PATIENTS. SO THAT WE CAN GIVE THEM AS MANY OF OUR WILLING OUT OF THE DORMS AND OPEN US SELL FRONTS- INTO SAFER HOUSING AND- WE HAVE A TEAM OF. BOTH CDCR AND CCHS HAS A TEAM THAT IS WORKING- ON PLANNING HOW TO DO THOSE MOVES ARE IT IS A CONCERN I'LL BET IT WOULD INVOLVE MOVING A LOT OF PATIENCE. AND GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE FROM SEE I AM THE SAN QUENTIN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE PLAN ON THE MOVES CAUSES. ME TO HAVE A SLEEPLESS NIGHT- BUT I THINK OVERALL. IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER FOR THESE PATIENTS IF THEY WERE MOVES. TO ANOTHER LOCATION. AND YOUR DATA. ROUGHLY THERE'S A TWO. PEOPLE WHO KNEW TO BE MADE. AND AS WE SEE THAT- COVERT MIRRORS WHAT OCCURS IN GENERAL SOCIETY THE FEAR IS AS WE GO INTO THIS DARK WINTER. THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE ANOTHER OUTBREAK AND SO I WOULD JUST. YEAH EMPHASIZE THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE FOR US TO GET AHEAD OF THIS. MAKE SURE WE'RE HOUSING PEOPLE ON THE APPROPRIATE SUBSTANCE. YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT AND I BELIEVE WE'RE STARTING WITH- OF THE EVEN THE HIGHER REAL THE SIX. LITTLE THE RISK FOR SIX AND ABOVE I BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA START WITH THOSE AND GO BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST AT RISK ARE DATA IS VERY CLEAR. THAT THE HIGHER YOUR RISK SCORE THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT IFYOU GET OPEN- YOU YOU YOU HAVE A HIGHER DEATH RATE. I'D LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH OUR OFFICE DOES WITH MINE REGARDING THE EXACT- DETAILS OF THAT CODE WOULD RISK SCORE I'M INTERESTED ACTUALLY TO. FIGURE OUT OF FOR USING IT ANOTHER CONGREGATE SETTINGS LIKE SNAPS SO WOULD LOVE TO. INFORMATION THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU BURKE MISTER. JUST FOLLOWING UP FOR I GUESS THE SECRETARY ON THIS ISSUE- GOING BACK TO PATIENTS WITH THIS RESTORE THREE OR HIGHER NOW MISTER KELSO JUST TALKED ABOUT IT BUT THEY'RE GIVEN THE OPTION TO MOVE. WHY IS IT OPTIONAL AND NOT MANDATORY IT SEEMS TO ME THE SAFETY OF BOTH THE PATIENT AND REDUCING THE RISK OF SPREAD TO OTHERS IN THE FACILITY STATE PRIORITY. OVER THE CONVENIENCE OF THE PATIENT IN MAY. SO WE'RE STARTING WITH. WITH MAKING IT OPTIONAL- AT THIS POINT IN TIME I WILL SAY THAT INMATES GET MOVED AROUND THE STATE EVERY SINGLE DAY INVOLUNTARY. SO WE'RE TRYING THAT KIND OF THE SOFTER GENTLER APPROACH OF TRYING TO A PATIENT EDUCATE AND TRAIN THAT THE OFFENDERS UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR OWN HEALTH. MODE THE HOW DO I SAY THIS IT'S ONLY SPECIFIC INSTITUTIONS THAT WITH THE RICHNESS OF PROGRAM DON'T WANT TO. SO IT'S A BECOME POP ART CONNOR TO TRYING GET THAT SAME BRIDGES APPROACH. ERROR LOCATIONS SO THAT IT'S THE SAME SAME FOR THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE JUST IN THEIR HEALTH NEEDS AS WELL AS A PROGRAM NEEDS. NUMBER ONE YOU SEE IMAGE GET MOVED EVERYDAY LEVELS OF DISCIPLINARY PROBLEMS HERE WE HAVE A PANDEMIC WITH A LOT OF ISSUES AND YOU GUYS ARE SECOND ONLY THE SNIFFS. IN NUMBER OF DEATHS SO. HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY MAKING OPTIONAL NOT MANDATORY TO HELP DEFEAT THIS PURPOSE OF THIS SITUATION AFTER ALL YOU ARE THE SECRETARY SALUTE TO MENTALLY YOU HAVE TO SAY SO IN THAT SO HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHY YOU'RE NOT MAKING THAT MANDATORY VERSUS AN OPTION TO THESE FOLKS. BECAUSE OF HELP STOP TO HELP THIS PREDICT THAT THEIR MOST VULNERABLE SO I WAS THE MOST VULNERABLE IN THEIR SITUATION. THEY MAY NOT WHILE THE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. BUT MEDICALLY IF THAT CAN PREVENT THAT PERSON FROM YOU'LL ACQUIRING COBIT AND KEEP MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH. WHY WE NOT MAKE THE MOVE. SO I JUST WANT TO- CLARK WNTS TO MAKE A COMMENT TO THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS ONE OF HIS RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE IT VOLUNTARY PENSION EDUCATE CORRECT BUT BUILT IN NINETY MINUTES. NO NO JUST ONE SECOND ALTERNATELY AS THE SECRETARY. IT'S YOUR CHOICE I MEAN I GUESS I GET I GET CARP CLARK'S POSITION. IS THE- IS YOU WHATEVER THE- RECEIVER I GET THAT. BUT ON THAT ISSUE YOU HAVE THE ULTIMATE SAY SO IN THAT. IN MY NAME IS THAT CORRECT IF I'M WRONG TELL ME SO. OKAY IN. TYPICALLY THAT WOULD BE CORRECT IN A CO THAT ENVIRONMENT AS OF APRIL. OF TWENTY TWENTY MR KELSO DRAFTED A MEMO TO THE THEN SECRETARY MR DEUS THAT HE- THAT ALL MOVEMENT WITHIN THE FACILITIES WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE RECEIVERS. HEALTH CARE POPULATION MANAGEMENT UNIT OKAY SO OUT OF OUT OF ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION WE DEFER TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS AS IT RELATES TO MOVES WITHIN OUR FACILITIES. NOW YOU ARE CORRECT IN THE FACT THAT IF I NEED TO MOVE SOMEBODY I WOULD CONSULT WITH THE RECEIVERS OFFICE AND WE WERE TRYING TO GET BY. WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN TO THE POINT AND I WOULD HAVE TO MESSAGE THIS VERY VERY CLEARLY. IF WE HAD TO DO MOVES AND DO YOU CAN UTILIZE FORCE IN ORDER TO DO THOSE MOVES. RIGHT THAT ALSO BECOMES DANGEROUS AND SO RIGHT NOW AND I'M ELECT CLARK SPEAK TO IT. BUT THE DECISION WAS MADE TO AFFORD THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF ANY REFUSAL RIGHT THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT. EARLIER COMMENT WAS WELL WILL TAKE AND WE NEED TO COLLECT DATA ON THOSE REFUSALS AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ADDRESS THOSE REFUSALS. SHORT OF UTILIZING FORCE TO DO IT BUT BEING I GUESS IT COMES BACK TO BEING NINE MONTHS INTO THIS. AT SOME POINT THE REST OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY SOMEONE'S GONNA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO IT IN. RIGHT NOW. RAMOS MIDWAY NOVEMBER. SO RAMOS IS THIS SOME POPULOUS INTO THIS AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO TAKE A DOG CHASING ITS TAIL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER IF I MIGHT. THE VIDEO- THE REASON TO DO THE MOVES OUT OF DORMS AND A SAFER HOUSING IS NOT BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO SLOW THE SPREAD. THE REASON TO THE MOVIES BECAUSE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS IT IMPROVES THEIR IT REDUCES THEIR RISK OF DEATH. AND THAT MEANS THAT THE MOVE IS VERY MUCH AN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE DECISION BY EACH PATIENT AND IN CDC ARE- WE ARE VERY PROTECTIVE OF LETTING OUR PATIENTS A MAKE THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS UNDER AND THEN. CONSENT RATIONALE NOW I THINK IF IT TURNS OUT THAT ALMOST NOBODY WANTS TO DO A MOVIE WE WILL RECONSIDER WHETHER A BILL SHOULD BE VOLUNTARY OR NOT. OR FOR EXAMPLE IN SAND POINT WHERE AT THIS POINT THE COURT ORDER SAYS YOU NEED TO REDUCE THE POPULATION TO UP SLOW THE SPREAD OF. WELL THE SET HAS MOVED OUT OF SAN QUENTIN MIGHT PRESENT A DIFFERENT. THE RATIONALE WHERE THERE IT MAY BE THE INVOLUNTARY MOVES MAKE A GREATER DEAL OF SENSE BUT BUT THAT'S WHY WE STARTED WITH THE NOTION OF INVOLUNTARY AYE I SHOULD ALSO ADD- WE NEED TO BE DOING THINGS OF THAT. GENERATE TRUST THAT OUR PATIENTS WILL TRUST US WHEN WE SAY THIS IS WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. AND IT SEEMS TO US THAT MAKING THIS THIS PROGRAM VOLUNTARY IS A WAY OF HELPING TO BUILD SOME UNDERSTANDING AND TRUST. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT ONE OF AXING COMES ON- BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO OVERCOME RESISTANCE. THAT EXISTS WITHIN OUR PATIENT POPULATION TO TAKING VACCINES. SO IT IT IT'S A MULTI FACETED DECISION- I DO APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS THOUGH AND MY HEALTH TEAM IS LISTENING TO THIS HEARING. SO I'M SURE THAT- THEY'LL BE SOME RECONSIDERATION OF OUR POSITION THANK YOU MR COLOSSAL SO HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN OPTIONAL FOR THEM. WELL THIS THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS JUST STANDING UP WITHIN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS. AND AT WHAT POINT DO YOU ANTICIPATE IF YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT TRANSFER THAT YOU WILL MAKE IT MANDATORY. I DON'T HAVE A SCHEDULE FOR THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT'S UP THERE THAT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON HOW QUICKLY WE CAN STAY ON THE PROGRAM UP AND THEN HOW. QUICKLY A WERE ABLE TO- EDUCATE ALL OF OUR PATIENTS OF WITH THE HELP OF THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES THE PRISON LAW OFFICE- AND GET DECISIONS I DON'T HAVE A TIMETABLE WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. BECAUSE IT IS A DARK WINTER THERE WERE FACING SO WE'RE TALKING POSSIBLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND NOT THAT LONG NO I HAVE NOT- BUT THIS MOVE PROGRAM HAS TO. MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. OKAY THIS THOUGHT IS NOT MY GUESS MY LAST THIS POLICY THAT YOU'VE GOT OF THE SITE ON. THE PATHWAY. INSTEAD OF MAKING IT MANDATORY MAKE DOING OPTIONAL THING THAT THAT'S THE PATH YOU'VE CHOSEN CORRECT. YES. THANK YOU ALL NEED OF MY ONLY ADVICE OF MY A MEDICAL LEADERSHIP AND PUBLIC HEALTH- EMMETT IS A TOPIC OF KONKAN GENUINE CONVERSATION LOW- BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM THAT IF YOU MAKE A VOLUNTARY AND THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO REFUSE- WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM NOW WE DID HAVE A SIMILAR SORT OF MOVES VERY RECENTLY- AND I BELIEVE IT WAS- CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION. FACILITY C. R. C. WAY ARE THEY WERE VERY SIX IN GETTING PEOPLE OF OUT OF IN INTO ATTEMPTS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON THE GROUND SO YOU KNOW IT MAY BE THAT. WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THIS PROBLEM OF A HIGH REFUSAL RATE- BUT I THINK WE WANT TO GIVE OUR PATIENTS A CHANCE TO MAKE THE FIRST DECISION. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER COUNCIL HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR YOU AND ALL YOU'VE DONE I GUESS IT'S JUST A PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT ON. YOU KNOW SOMEONE AT RISK. YOU KNOW WHO'S TO BETTER TO MAKE THAT DECISION. THOSE FOLKS ARE THE FOLKS WITH THE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE IN DOING THAT I THINK SOMETIMES THEY WE GIVE TOO MUCH LEEWAY AND WE JUST DO WHAT'S MAYBE NOT THE POPULAR THING AND MAKE PEOPLE DO THINGS. BUT WE DON'T DO THAT IS TO THE SOCIETIES OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER MARTIN NOW FOR A GREAT PRICE THE IDEA OF A COUPLE QUESTIONS- IS OUR IG STILL THERE. BUT HE'S A DIFFERENT ALSO YES YES I'M STILL HERE WONDERFUL COULD COULD YOU TALK US THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR FINDINGS I THINK. THE SECRETARY MENTIONED THAT SHE FOUND THEM HELPFUL OF THE CAN YOU KIND OF GIVE US A SENSE OF THE- A BETTER SENSE OF THE TIMING BECAUSE- IT IS A LITTLE BIT SURPRISING THAT WERE IN OCTOBER AND A STATE AGENCY. WOULD HAVE TO REITERATE WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN. FURLEY COMMON KNOWLEDGE NOT JUST WITHIN THE STATE- AGENCIES BUT WITHIN ALSO THE PUBLIC WHERE WE'VE KNOWN FOR NOT JUST WEEKS BUT MONTHS THAT WEARING MASKS ARE CRITICAL TO STOPPING THE SPREAD OF. UVID SO. WHEN YOU HAVE AN AGENCY- YOU KNOW ONE OF TWO PLACES WILL SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND STATE PRISONS BEING PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SPREAD. OF FOR THE SPREAD OF CALLED IT IN FOR THE MAIN SOURCE OF DEATHS OF CORPORATE WITHIN THE STATE. YOU TO HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WASN'T CLEAR TO THIS PARTICULAR AGENCY AND WHY IN YOUR OPINION IT WASN'T BEING IMPLEMENTED. THREE THE FREE SCORING ISSUE WAS. WELL FIRST OF ALL OUR OUR- THE AREA THAT WE THE TIME PERIOD THAT WE LOOKED AT WAS A PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS EVOLVED SINCE THEN. BOB BUT OF WHAT WE FOUND HIM AND ALL I CAN COULD COULD YOU RESTATE AS WELL. COULD YOU RESTATE THE TIME PERIOD JUST FOR EVERYBODY. YEAH WE START ROUGHLY- IN MARCH TWO TWENTY TWENTY TWO ROUGHLY JULY. TWENTY TWENTY. OUR OUR METHODOLOGY NECESSARILY REQUIRES US TO GATHER DATA AND DATA TIME PERIOD AND THEN DRAW THE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE DATA IS TELLING US SO. WE WERE AWARE AND HONESTLY I THINK THE DEPARTMENT WAS AWARE THAT THE ONLY GIRL IN THEIR QUIVER FOR- THAT WAS THAT WAS PROVEN TO HELP STOP THE SPREAD WAS THE WEAR MASKS HOWEVER I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE- US DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT- I KNOW THAT THE THAT THE HEADQUARTERS LEADERSHIP. UNDERSTOOD THIS BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT EVER GOT DOWN TO THE LOCAL SUPERVISORS AT- AT AND THE WORDS THAT THIS WAS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT THEY NEEDED TO RESOLVE IN FACT ONE COMMENT WE HAVE. AND I'LL READ IT- ONE COMMENT FROM A STAFF MEMBER AT ONE OF THE PRISONS IN RESPONSE TO OUR SURVEY WAS THE MAJORITY OF CUSTODY STAFF REFUSED TO WEAR PP EVAN WHEN THIS WAS REPORTED TO SUPERVISORS THEIR REPEATED RESPONSE WAS THAT THE MANDATES WERE UNDER FOR UNENFORCEABLE. BECAUSE THESE WERE ADULTS. HI I AM AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHY. THAT WOULD NOT HAVE- HAVE GENERATED- A MORE SERIOUS RESPONSE BUT IN FACT EVEN IN SOME TO SOME OF THE WORDS THAT I SPOKE PERSONALLY TO. THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE SAME THEY DID TAKE THIS UP WITH THE SAME SERIOUSNESS THAT I THINK A LOT OF THE- OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND CERTAINLY OF THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE- TOOK IT- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THERE WAS. OF A LOT OF. UNDERSTANDING OR ACCEPTANCE THAT MASKS WERE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS. AND OF. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT ELSE TO TELL YOU ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE WELL LET ME LET ME HAVE AS THE RESULTS BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T BEGIN TO WATER. ONE SECOND YOU'RE I MEAN I'M I'M ASKING YOUR OPINION WHY RIGHT I MEAN BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE. ON WITH THE SYSTEM AND THE FACILITIES. I'M JUST GONNA JUMP OFF YOUR QUOTE BECAUSE I APPRECIATE THE- QUESTIONS MY COLLEAGUE MEL GROVE US. ON IT IS IT IS IT IN YOUR OPINION. THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS DIFFICULTY ENFORCING RULES WITH ADULTS. NO I DON'T THINK THEY I DON'T THINK THEY DO I THINK THERE ARE SOME. ISSUES THAT THEY ARE VERY CLEAR AND VERY ABLE TO ENFORCE. ARE THERE ARE ALSO SOME ISSUES THAT THEY SIMPLY DON'T LOOK AT WITH THE SAME SERIOUSNESS THAT- THAT WE MIGHT LOOK AT IT MY OFFICE FOR. SO RIGHT. MY IMPRESSION AND PERHAPS MY IMPRESSIONS INCORRECT RIGHT. IS THESE ARE FACILITIES WHERE THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RULES IF YOU GO TO PRISON BECAUSE FREEDOM IS RESTRICTED NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE. GOTTEN INCREASE LIBERTY YOU'VE YOU LOSS OF LIBERTY AND FREEDOM SO I AM STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. HOW THIS MAJOR RULED THAT WE ENFORCE OF THE PUBLIC RIGHT WITH IF THE PUBLIC WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WHICH THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DO. IF THEY WANT TO DO IT IN PERSON. THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO COME INTO THE CAPITOL BUILDING WITHOUT A MASK. AND THAT HAS AS AS SOON AS WE CAME BACK AND REOPEN THE CAPITAL I BELIEVE IN EARLY. MAY THAT WAS. THAT WAS SO THE PROTOCOL. LET ME ASK A DIFFERENT QUESTION SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY. THE. I'M WONDERING WHETHER IT WASN'T THAT ARE PEOPLE DIDN'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY WHETHER THE WARDENS AS WELL AS THE SUPERVISORS AT THE FACILITIES DIDN'T WANT TO AMASS PERIOD. BECAUSE THEY CLEARLY DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE IN FORCING RULES IN FACT IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE FACILITIES ON THE RULES ARE CREATED TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S SAFETY THE SAFETY OF BOTH THE OFFICERS THE STAFF BUT ALSO OF THE INMATES AND SO YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT AGAIN. WE WERE ASKING PEOPLE TO WEAR A MASK BECAUSE IT WAS FASHIONABLE OR SOMETHING IT WAS IT WAS FOR PEOPLE'S PHYSICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY. SO HI I CAN ONLY COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT. THEY DON'T DO IT. WELL I'LL I WOULD BE IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION I WOULD PROBABLY- MIRROR WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER- NOTED EARLIER IS THAT THESE WORDS HAVE. A LOT OF DISCRETION THAT IS GRANTED TO THEM THROUGH FROM THE DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP AND- WHAT THAT LEADS TO. IS IN SOME INSTANCES THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THINGS AND THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT DID NOT RECEIVE. A LOT OF HEADQUARTERS- NOTICES UNTIL JUST VERY RECENTLY. WHEN YOU SEE RECENTLY WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT LIKE LAST WEEK LAST MONTH I'M TALKING LAST WEEK- WE WERE OUT AND WE WERE OUT OF IT INSTITUTION- ON MONDAY YESTERDAY. FOR MONDAY AND- WE- I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE WARDEN WHO. WHO THEN TOLD US IT WAS NOW CRYSTAL CLEAR TO HIM WHAT HIS JOB WHAT'S- AND THAT WAS MADE CRYSTAL CLEAR. BY THE BY THE SECRETARY AND THE RECEIVER WHO LEFT THEM NO DOUBT WHAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS WERE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT HAPPENED EARLY ON. SO I KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE VERY MASS IS BEING BEEN A POLITICAL ISSUES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR STATE I MEAN. IT HAS NOT BEEN AT LEAST AT LEAST JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION IS NOT BEEN. OF POLITICAL- SITUATION IN OUR- IN OUR GOVERNOR OUR STATE GOVERNMENT- WE- WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE. DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ABOUT OPENING UP AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER TURNS YOU KNOW THE ECONOMY AND I THINK THOSE ARE ALL- EXTRA THINGS THAT WE CONTINUE TO DELIBERATE AND HEALTH POLICY DISCUSSIONS BUT REALLY THOUGH THE WORD OF THE MASS HASN'T BEEN. OUT A MAJOR POLITICAL ISSUE- BUT I. I MEAN I COME TO COULD I CAN ONLY COME TO CUSHION I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THE WARDENS HAVE. AN IMMENSE AUTHORITY EACH OF THEM. AND IF THEY- WARRANT- ENFORCING THE PROTOCOLS. I CAN ONLY SORT OF IMAGINE THAT THEY JUST. AGAIN COME TO CONCLUSION THAT IT DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT IN THIS SEEMS GIVEN THAT THE GOVERNOR- YOU KNOW SENSE COVERT STARTED HAS PRETTY MUCH BEEN ON TV EVERY DAY EVERY OTHER DAY EVERY THREE DAYS. AND ONE OF HIS CONTINUING MESSAGES TO THE PUBLIC INCLUDING ALL THE STATE AGENCIES BUT JUST TO THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN TO WEAR A MASK- THE SUIT SO WHY DO YOU THINK IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THE DEPARTMENT. MANAGEMENT TO COME. DELIVER THE MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN DELIVERING PRETTY MUCH SENSE I DON'T KNOW ROUGHLY MARCH OR APRIL. WELL IN IT IN FAIRNESS TO THE DEPARTMENT THEY'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF WITH THE OUTBREAKS AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK THEY SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE. OF THE WHERE WITH ALL FOR WHATEVER REASON TO MAKE THIS A PRIORITY AND NOW THAT SOME ATTENTION HAS BEEN. FOCUSED ON IT AND WAS FOCUSED BECAUSE OF THE HOW THE RESULTS THAT WE REPORTED I THINK THAT THEY HAVE OF. THEY'LL COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES SOME- UPPER LEVEL LEADERSHIP INVOLVEMENT AND THAT'S HAPPENING WE'RE WE ARE WE WILL WE NEED TO SEE WHETHER THAT STICKS BUT- AT THIS POINT- I THINK THAT BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE PRESENTED OUR REPORT. WE HAVE THE ATTENTION OF THE LEADERSHIP AT THE DEPARTMENT AND HALF CCH YES AND I'M HOPING THAT THAT WILL DRIVE SOME OF THESE. SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE POLICIES WHICH ARE THERE. IT'S SO SOUNDS LIKE YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR FEELING OR I'M JUST PARAPHRASING WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY. IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT RE OR SORT OF RE ITERATING THE FACE COVERING PROTOCOLS LAST WEEK WERE A DIRECT RESULT OF YOUR REPORT AND YOUR YOUR INVESTIGATION I. I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT- I HAVE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WE'RE SECRETARY ALISON ABOUT THE RESULTS THAT WE FOUND. AND WE'VE HAD GOOD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND I THINK THAT- WHAT THE SECRETARY AND THE RECEIVER DID LAST FRIDAY AND THEIR DISCUSSION WITH THE WARDENS WAS A DIRECT RESULT OF SORT OF HEARING THIS DRUMBEAT OF THIS IS ONE THING YOU CAN DO IT IT'S NOT BEING ENFORCED. I'M IN AND WHOSE WHOSE PURVIEW IS THIS HELP ME CLARIFY IS IT THE RECEIVERS PURVIEW. BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH RELATED MATTER WAS A REALLY THE SECRETARY'S PARTY YES I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THEM BUT I WOULD THINK THAT IS A JOINT PURVIEW THE- OF THE SECRETARY CLEARLY HAS. AUTHORITY FOR THE CUSTODY STAFF IN THOSE PRISONS THE RECEIVER CLEARLY HAS SOME AUTHORITY FOR THE HEALTH CARE PEOPLE- AND THAT. THAT PRISON POPULATION OF STAFF IS A IS A MIXTURE OF THOSE SO I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT'S ONE OR THE OTHER PERSONALLY- BUT I'D HAVE TO I'D HAVE TO DEFER TO THE FOOTBALL NUMBER. YET HOW OFTEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET ME JUST STOP YOUR WITH MY QUESTIONS FOR YOU BUT LET ME JUST EXPRESS MY PERSONAL APPRECIATION FOR YOUR WORK. YOUR CONTINUED WORK- WITHIN THIS DEPARTMENT- YOU CONTINUE TO RAISE ISSUES FORWARD ON BEHALF OF THE SPEAKER OF THE PRO TEM THE LEGISLATURE. ISSUES THAT IN MY OPINION IF YOU WEREN'T. CABLE TO DO YOUR- WOULD REMAIN. UNDERGROUND AND I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT JUST BECAUSE- YOU HAVE A GROUP OF INMATES WHO. REALLY I CAN'T REALLY COMMUNICATE WITH US OUTSIDE OF THROUGH THEIR FAMILIES CAN REALLY GIVE US A SENSE OF- WHAT'S GOING ON- YOU HAVE A LOT OF OFFICERS WHO ALSO I'LL TELL YOU FEEL IN THAT SAME. HEY IN THAT SAME ROOM IN THE SAME- WORLD AS WELL AS SELF SO I THINK I REALLY YOU JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. FOR YOUR WORK AND REALLY- DOING THIS PARTICULAR PART PASSED THE SPEAKER BUT JUST THANK YOU FOR REALLY- YOUR YOUR WORK AND AGAIN DURING YOUR CONTINUED HER ENTIRE STAFF AND ALL EVERYTHING THEY DO FOR A TO REALLY HELP IMPROVE THIS DEPARTMENT. SO LET ME JUST GO BACK TO. SECRETARY ALISON OR MR KELSO WHOEVER HAPPENS TO BE SITTING IN THE CHAIR MAKE IT EASY SO NO ONE HAS TO MOVE. WHAT OKAY. YEAH FONG. YES SIR THANK YOU SECRETARY OWN SO WE ARM. YES FROM FROM SCRATCHING MY HEAD A LITTLE BIT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT TOOK TELL LAST WEEK TO REITERATE OR YOU KNOW GOVERNOR NEWSOM SECTOR GALLEY- HAS BEEN NOT ONLY DEMANDING OF THE STATE AGENCIES BUT REALLY THE ENTIRE PUBLIC OF CALIFORNIA. L. Y. TOOK TO LAST WEEK TO- REINFORCE THAT MESSAGE AND WHAT WAS THE IMPETUS FOR THAT COMMUNICATION. SO THERE'S BEEN MULTIPLE MEMORANDUMS FROM BOTH THE DIRECTOR OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS AND- DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THIRTY SINCE THE BEGINNING HI I'M TRYING TO I WAS TRYING TO GET AN EXACT NUMBER I WANT TO SAY IT'S APPROXIMATELY FIVE DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AS IT RELATES TO MASKS EACH OF THEM INCREASING EVERY SINGLE TIME SOME OF THOSE ARE SUBTLE NUANCES AS IT RELATES TO OKAY YOU'RE IN AN OFFICE BY YOURSELF SOMEBODY WALKS IN. AND OFTENTIMES AND WE FOUND THIS ON BOTH THE CASTING SIDE AS WELL AS THE MEDICAL SIDE. TO REALIZE- JUST BECAUSE OF AN OFFICE. IN SOMEBODY WALK SAID I HAVE TO WERE PUT PUT ON A MASK. AND FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT STAFF AS THEY WERE WALKING IN THE GATE THEY HAVE A MONTH UNDER THEIR NECK VERSUS POINT UP OVER THERE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE WALKING DESERT THINKING WHILE I'M OUTSIDE. BUT YET THEY WEREN'T SIX FEET APART AND SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE OUR MASS MEMO'S BEEN EVER CHANGING- I WILL SAY THAT- BOTH CLARK AND I TAKE THIS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY WHEN I WALK INS. I SEE STAFF WEARING MASKS. YOU KNOW I WHEN I GO TO AN INSTITUTION- AND- I HONESTLY I PERSONALLY HAVEN'T. EXPERIENCED LARGE NUMBERS OF STAFF NOT WORRY NOW SOMETIMES IT'S SO IT'S A ONE OFF I WAS RECENTLY AN INSTITUTION I WAS CHASING DOWN SOME STAFF OF THE SONG. I JUST TOOK OFF MY IN NINETY FIVE AND I WAS GET READY TO PUT ALL MY- PERSONAL MASK AND I'M LIKE. OKAY BUT IT'S NOT. AND SO- YOU KNOW AND SHE SHE RAN OVER TO SHOW ME THE TRASH AND WE SHOULD THROW IT AWAY TEN FEET BACK NO I'M NOT NO I'M I'M PRETTY SURE THAT SO COULD LOSE THEM YOU JUST. TRY TO GET AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SO- I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE HAD FIVE FIVE MEMOS LET'S JUST SAY THERE IS NUMEROUS. MEMORANDUMS AND NUMEROUS COMMUNICATIONS AND THEN I'LL JUST USE AND USE THE- EXAMPLE THAT I USE WITH MY STAFF. HI I HAVE STAFF- YOU KNOW THAT OUR OUR YOUNGER RIGHT HE YOU KNOW LIKE I I'M OLDER SO. SOMETIMES ALL EMAIL OTHER TIMES I WILL MAKE A PHONE CALL- I HAVE A RULE OF MY STAFF THAT IF YOU SEND ME AN EMAIL AND YOU DON'T GET A RESPONSE. ASSUME WHAT ASSUME IT'S NOT BEEN READ. OR IF I ASK YOU TO SOMETHING. TO DO SOMETHING IS INTO. IT HE IS TO WHATEVER JOB WAS DONE. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION BACK TO YOU IS. THE FOR THE MEMOS WERE SENT. DID YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THE MEMOS WERE BEING IMPLEMENTED. YES WE DID HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THROUGH TRAINING DOCUMENTS THAT THEY WERE BEING IMPLEMENTED- WE INCREASED THAT TO PROVIDE. DISCIPLINARY ACTION WHEN NECESSARY AND THEN ONSITE INSPECTIONS. WHAT WE ME THROUGH TRAINING DOCUMENTS THAT THEY WERE BEING COMMITMENTS ARE IF YOU COULD ELABORATE FOR I'M SORRY I PREFER PRACTICE THAT WE PROVIDED TRAINING TO OUR INSTITUTIONS. WHEN WE SEND OUT A MEMBER WE GENERALLY I WILL PUT- A TRAINING CODE ON THEM TO MAKE SURE ALL STAFF ARE TRAINED. OKAY SO THE STAFF WERE TRAINED BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE. WEARING THE MASKS. SO THE ONLY WAY WE CAN I MEAN OBVIOUSLY INSTITUTION HEADS NEED TO TOUR FACILITIES MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS NEED TO TOUR FACILITIES AND SET VERY CLEAR EXPECTATIONS. OF I WILL SAY THAT WE REQUIRE DOCUMENTATION NOW THAT THEY TOUR AND PROVIDE VERIFICATION THAT PEOPLE WORK STAFF FOR COMPLIANCE WITH MASK WEARING. TO INCLUDE NOW WE HAVE THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTORS AND REGIONAL HEALTH CARE EXECUTIVES ALSO DOING THOSE ON SITE- UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS. IT WOULD THESE UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS START. THEY JUST BEGAN WITH THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS GOT IT ON. WAS WITH THE MOST RECENT COMMUNICATION TO THE- STAFF IN RESPONSE TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S FEEDBACK TO YOU BUT WHAT HE HAD BEEN FINDING. YES ON IN JUST ACROSS IT IS THERE A REASON WHY- THERE WEREN'T INSPECTIONS. GOING ON PREVIOUS TO A FEW WEEKS AGO I FOR EXAMPLE WE HEARD THE SAME SITUATION WITH THE NURSING HOMES AND SO THE NURSING HOMES. ON THE- THE STATE SET UP A STRIKE TEAM AND THEY HAVE STRIKE TEAMS THAT WERE- HITTING- ALL THE VARIOUS NURSING HOMES DILLON SURPRISE VISITS I ENSURING THAT THEY WERE- YOU KNOW ENFORCING THE OTHER VARIOUS PROTOCOLS IT AND THAT WAS BECAUSE AGAIN. NURSING HOMES WERE CONTRIBUTING TO THE SPIKE OF. LOADED WITH IN THE STATE JUST LIKE THE- PRISONS ARE SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY- IT DIDN'T APPEN SOONER TO HAVE A STRIKE TEAM PER SE WAR WAR IN INTROSPECTION TEAM ENSURING THAT. PROTOCOLS ARE BEING FOLLOWED ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE WAS. THE BASIC ONE POINT WHERE I MASS. RIGHT I WILL SAY THAT. AS IT HAS EVOLVED ALL THE VARIOUS MEMOS WE CAN SEARCH BY G. COPIES OF THE I THINK FIVE POSSIBLY MORE I BELIEVE THE MEMBERS WERE THERE I'M JUST NOT BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE IMPLEMENTED. IT HONESTLY WHEN YOU READ THAT L. Y. G. REPORT YOU REALIZE THAT. SO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SYSTEMIC FAILURE IN A IN A IN A IN A DEPARTMENT- I WILL SAY AT MOST INSTITUTIONS I TOWARD I HAVE NOT SEEN OR WITNESSED ANY- DIRECT CONCERNS SYSTEMICALLY RIGHT MEANING LIKE THE MAJORITY STAFF REFUSING TO WEAR MASKS AND I'VE GONE INSTITUTIONS IN REMOTE LOCATIONS. WHERE YOU KNOW THE SOME PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S CO THAT OUR COMMUNITY THAT NEVER BEEN HIT BY COBIT BUT OUR STAFF WERE TAKEN SERIOUSLY TO WHERE THE IT TOOK TO WEAR MASKS. SO I WILL SAY THAT TOO I THINK IT'S A SYSTEMIC ISSUE MAYBE EARLY ON YES BUT I WILL SAY AS AS TIME ROLLED ON AND ARE FURTHER EXPANSIONS OF KOBE BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENTS KINDA LATE IN IN ACTUALLY GETTING CODED. YOU KNOW. MASS OUTBREAK THAT WE SEEN WE WERE SEATED CHAU WAS OBVIOUSLY OUR FIRST- AND I. WOULD NOT BEEN THERE BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE SUBSEQUENT- AND I APOLOGIZE KIND OF GET. LOST IN MY THOUGHTS HERE SAYS GIVES ME. I WILL SAY THAT THE- IG REPORT HIGHLIGHTED VERY SPECIFIC THINGS THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED AND THOSE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED NOW MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADDRESSED IN SOME MEMORANDUM. BUT I WILL SAY THAT WITH- EMPHASIS ON THOSE YOU KNOW WE DID HAVE MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS RESPONSIBLE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. LOCALLY WE TOOK THAT OUT YOU KNOW WE NOW HAVE EXPANDED THAT TO INCLUDE OUR REGIONALS. JUSTIN AS LIKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES. WHY LET ME FIRST FAN THANK YOU FOR YOU KNOW ONCE. YOU HEARD FROM THE I. G. THAT HOW YOU TOOK- YOU KNOW IN MY OPINION FAIRLY SWIFT ACTIONS I REALLY DO. APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT IS THAT THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE RECOGNIZED. I WOULD ALSO SAY JUST LIKE WHAT WHEN I GO TO THE FACILITY I'M SURE JUST LIKE WHEN YOU GO VISIT FACILITY EVERYONE SORT OF ON THEIR BEST BEHAVIOR. SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY A TRUE INDICATION AS TO WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON I DON'T THINK I CAN VISIT ANY FACILITY AND REALLY GET US REAL IDEA OF. WHAT'S GOING ON ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS I DON'T APPLY TO GET EVERYBODY ON THEIR BEST BEHAVIOR AND- EVERYTHING'S BEEN CLEANED AND XCERRA. SO I THOUGHT I WOULD URGE YOU TO- YOU KNOW EXPAND THAT TEAM THAT IS GOING AROUND AND- DOING VISIS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS THAT THERE IS- YOU KNOW INSPECTIONS OCCURRING ON. IT IN TERMS OF- SYSTEMIC FAILURE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WHILE THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE E. COLI OUTBREAK IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THE COVERT OPERATE WITHIN. THE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM AGAIN THE REASON WE'RE HAVING THE HEARING IS AS WELL THE HEARING THAT WE HAD ON SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IS. FAR AWAY INSTITUTIONALLY THESE TWO TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS LONG CREATED DISPROPORTION NET NOT NUMBER OF KOBE CASES IN SO. I DON'T I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT GOING AGAINST ALL THE VARIOUS PRISON FACILITIES BECAUSE OF HOW PEOPLE ARE HOUSED IN THE CROWDING EXCITER CENTER ACCENT REAL SPENT DODD THAT'S WHY WE ARE. SO CONCERNED- I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF YOUR CONTROL WHICH IS THE PHYSICAL PLANT WE CANNOT CHANGE THAT VERY EASILY. BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE WITH IN ON YOUR CONTROL AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WORKING YOUR CONTROL. THAT COULD HAVE REDUCED WOULDN'T HAVE MITIGATED EVERYTHING BUT COULD HAVE REDUCED THE SITUATION. ON WAS NOT WAS NOT DONE AND WAS NOT DONE IN A SYSTEMIC FASHION. SO THAT THE FACT THAT THERE'S ENOUGH DATA. TO SHOW PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT THE INSTITUTION- DOES POINT OUT THAT THERE WAS- SOME SOME SOME SOME LEVEL OF SYSTEMATIC FAILURE AND IN MY OPINION. ON WHETHER WE HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ON THAT. ON IT. JUSTIN I ASKED THE SAME QUESTION FOR THE IG BUT IS IT IS A REALLY UNDER YOUR PURVIEW WERE SUS UNDER THE- THE RECEIVERS PURVIEW THIS THIS PARTICULAR. BECAUSE I GUESS YOU BOTH SIGNED THE MEMORANDUM. THE MEMORANDUM THIS I HAVE TO I HAVEN'T OF ME. SO THERE'S MULTIPLE MEMORY. YES IT IS A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN- C. C. R. A C. C. H. C. S. SO WE'VE HAD A VARIETY OF MEMOS. THAT HAVE BEEN SIGNED EITHER BY AT THE DIRECTORATE LEVEL. OR ADD OF THE SECRETARY AND RECEIVER LEVEL. SO IS DOCTOR BIXEL THEIR- YES OF COURSE BUT TO HAVE THE- FOR THE JOINT RESPONSIBILITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY. THANK YOU FOR GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE SO JUST SET UP A SIMILAR QUESTIONS RIGHT I MEAN YOU'RE- THE YOUR YOUR DOCTOR I IMAGINE LOOK DO YOU LIKE- ALL THE VARIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE. DISCOVERED EARLY ON THAT WEARING A MASK WAS WELL ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COVERT IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT. I THINK PRETTY EARLY ON WE KNEW THAT IT WAS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR RESPONSE YES- DO. IN THE END WHY WHY IN YOUR OPINION WAS IT NOT UNIFORMLY IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT THE- SYSTEM. SO ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK IT WAS AN ISSUE SO MUCH OF NOT BEING UNIFORMLY IMPLEMENTED IT'S JUST THAT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS ARE GETTING ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ON THE SAME PAGE AND COMPLYING CAN BE CHALLENGING. WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT START WITH A PIECE PEOPLE. YOU HAVE PEOPLE DYING IN FACILITIES A PRETTY PRETTY HIGH NUMBERS. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THAT AS A CUE TO. TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. WELL I THINK WHAT WE SEE IN OUR SYSTEM REALLY MIRRORS WHAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS OUR COUNTRY FOR A VARIETY OF. REASONS WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE SELLING DOUBT AND CONFUSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT MASKS ARE HELPFUL OR WHETHER THEY'RE HARMFUL- THAT'S BEEN IT AS YOU'VE NOWN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION- IN OUR IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM FOR SOME TIME AND- SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING INSIDE OUR INSTITUTIONS IS IN MANY WAYS JUST A REFLECTION. OF THAT SAME ARGUMENT- THE DEPARTMENT REALLY ACTED QUITE PROMPTLY EARLY ON IN IN CONVERTING PIAA FACTORIES TO CREATING FACE COVERINGS AND PROVIDING THEM TO ALL OF OUR PATIENTS AND TO ALL OF OUR STAFF. AND ESTABLISHING THE EXPECTATION THAT THOSE WOULD BE USED TO SO I THINK THE DEPARTMENT ACTED PROMPTLY- BUT AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ALL ARE. FREE THINKERS SOMETIMES- IT DOES NOT GO THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD HOPE I TOTALLY TOTALLY AGREE AND I COULDN'T DOWN. I'M I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE THAT BUT- WE DON'T HAVE FREEDOM IN ARE. YOU YOU ARE A DEPARTMENT. YOUR YOU DON'T RUN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL. YOU DEPARTMENT WERE FREEDOM HAS BEEN. TAKEN WORK. SO WHAT WAS SO DIFFICULT ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THE GOVERNOR AND SECRETARY COLLEAGUES DIRECTIVE IT WASN'T IT WASN'T I'M A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED SECRETARY ALISON CHARACTERIZES IT AS IT WASN'T CLEAR I THINK IT WAS PRETTY CRYSTAL CLEAR. HIGH EVER SINCE I'VE RETURNED BACK TO WORK AND WE'VE MY FIRST RETURN BACK TO WORK IN THIS ROOM I GOT MY COLLEAGUES HERE WE ALL. SHOWED UP WITH THE MASS WHEN WE RETURN. SO WHAT. WHY WERE STATE EMPLOYEES ALL STATE EMPLOYEES LET'S JUST YOU KNOW STATE EMPLOYEES. WHY WERE STATE EMPLOYEES ALLOWED. TO DISREGARD BUT THE GOVERNOR AND SECRETARY KHALID. REALLY KIND OF ORDERED EVERYBODY TO DO. WELL FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING I'M SAYING BE INTERPRETED AS SUGGESTING THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT FACE COVERINGS ARE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE DO. IT'S BEEN PART OF OUR PLAN FROM VERY EARLY TIMES IN FACT WHEN WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUTBREAKS IN INSTITUTIONS WE'VE GONE BEYOND STANDARD FACE COVERINGS AND IN SOME SITUATIONS ABOUT BREAKS HAVE PROVIDED N. NINETY FIVE MASKS TO BOTH OUR EMPLOYEES AND TO THE RESIDENTS WHO ARE AN OUTBREAK FACILITIES AND UNABLE TO- WE FEEL PROTECT THEMSELVES WITH JUST STANDARD FEE. THAT BEING SAID- MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT WEARING A FACE COVERING IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN IN YOUR DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES MANY OF FACE COVERINGS ARE- FICK THERE THEY MAKE YOU ARE HOT SOME PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE HARD TO BREED WITH AND JUST THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR YOU AND I TO WEAR THE FACE COVERING THROUGH OUR DAY AND THEN TRY TO EXTRAPOLATE THAT FOR OUR PATIENTS- WHO BASICALLY ARE BEING ASKED TO WEAR FACE COVERING. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY REALLY CANNOT GET AWAY BY THEMSELVES IN A CLOSED ROOM WITH NO ONE ELSE IN THEIR AREA IT'S REALLY A HEAVY LIFT AND SO MY EXPERIENCE IS BAD I MEAN I SPENT TIME IN IN DISABILITIES ON A REGULAR BASIS. AT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF OUR PATIENTS AND OUR STAFF ARE DOING A PRETTY DARN GOOD JOB OF WEARING THEIR FACE COVERINGS UP THERE NOT BEING PERFECT THEY'RE FALLIBLE AS MANY OF YOU HAVE POINTED OUT OUR PHYSICAL PLANT IS NOT VERY CONDUCIVE- TO PEOPLE BEING PERFECT BUT THEIR FACE MASKS STAFF DON'T HAVE BREAK ROOMS WHERE THEY CAN GO EAT ON A REGULAR BASIS. IT'S NOT EASY FOR THEM TO JUST STEP OUTSIDE AND GET A QUICK BREATH OF FRESH AIR SO THEY CAN TAKE THEIR MASK OFF FOR FIVE MINUTES DURING THEIR SHIFT MANY OF THEM WORKED DOUBLE SHIFTS THERE IS ONLY FOR A LOT OF TIME SO I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE. ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS I. JUST THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. WE IT IS THAT WERE. ARE IN CENTER STAFF DO. I DON'T THINK THAT'S VOCAL AND I THINK WE- I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND- THIS IS BEEN A PANDEMIC THAT'S AFFECTED EVERY SINGLE PERSON THE STATE THERE'S NO QUESTION AND IN YOUR RIGHT IT IS A IT IS A BURDEN. ON THE FOLKS THAT WE ARE ASKING. TO DO THAT. BUT BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID WHAT I WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY WAS IN GENERAL SYSTEMICALLY WE ARE. ENFORCING THE ARMS WE ARE ENFORCING THE MASK PROTOCOLS. BUT IT'S REALLY JUST EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S FALLIBILITY AND ABSOLUTELY. EVERY NOW AND THEN- PEOPLE AREN'T FOLLOWING- FROM THE RULES THAT THAT'S SORT OF. WHAT I HEARD BECAUSE OF. BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST GET TIRED RIGHT WE'LL GET WE ALL GET TIRED OF WEARING THESE MASTERS NO QUESTION DOES NOT DEMAND ALTHOUGH I WOULD BE THE FIRST PERSON TO ADMIT THAT. ON BUT THAT'S SORT OF WHAT. I HEARD YOU SAY THAT FOR. CHARACTERIZATION WELL WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WE'VE GOT FOLKS WERE ARE WORKING REALLY REALLY HARD IN A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY'RE BEING EXPOSED TO- THE POSSIBILITY OF CORBETT- EVERY DAY AT WORK- THEIR FIRST RESPONDERS ARE PEACE OFFICERS ARE NURSES ARE PHYSICIANS I THINK THEY'RE ALL DOING A PRETTY DARN GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO COMPLY. I THINK PERHAPS THE PART THAT HAS BEEN LACKING INTO RECENTLY IS THE DISCIPLINARY COMPONENT OF WHAT WE WILL DO WITH FOLKS WHO WE JUST ARE NOT WILLING TO COMPLY I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO TAKE% THEIR MASK DOWN TO EAT THEIR SANDWICH IN THEIR TEN MINUTE BREAK PEOPLE WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON DECIDE IT'S JUST NOT IMPORTANT. THAT COMPONENT IS NOW BEING STRENGTHENED AND. AND I THINK THAT BY DOING THAT IT HERE IT'S IS GOING TO EAT IMPROVE THE THOUGH LET ME UNDER THIS YOU YOU'LL FOR MR CAL SOUTHERN RIGHT YOUR PER OF HIS OPERATION. THAT'S CORRECT. IT AND HE- TRULY BROUGHT A FOR IN THIS. CORRECT COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN WELL HE HE ARM WITHIN WITHIN THE HELP HE'S BEEN HE'S BEEN ASKED BY A JUDGE TO. OVERSEE THE HEALTH OF THE INMATES WITHIN THE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM AND HE IS VERY BROAD AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THAT THEIR HEALTH IS BEING TAKEN CARE OF. IS THAT CORRECT YES I WOULD I WOULD AGREE AND YOU YOU AS THE DOCTOR ARE I WOULD IMAGINE THE HEAD MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IN CHARGE OF THE. THAT'S CORRECT SO YOU HEALTH WE ARE WE ALL TO GIVE NO ONE'S ARGUING HERE THE IMPORTANCE OF WEARING MASKS- NEW ONES ARE ARGUING. WHAT WHAT IT DOES. SO WHY IS IT THAT YOU AND MR KELSO. DIDN'T USE ALL YOUR AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY WAS WEARING A MASK TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF. THE INMATES BUT ALSO THE SAFETY OF EVERYBODY WHO WORKS IN THE FACILITY I'M NOT JUST GIVING EXAMPLE I MEAN. IF YOU WORK AT A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT YOU HAVE TO WEAR CERTAIN SUIT DO YOU HAVE A YOU HAVE A CHOICE. THE THEFT AND THAT'S IT THAT'S IT IS NOT BECAUSE IT LOOKS GOOD IT'S BECAUSE- IT'S FOR YOUR OWN. SAFETY FOR YOUR OWN HEALTH AND SAFETY. SO YOU HAVE A PANDEMIC THAT IS SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS MASK AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS IT IS- A BIT IS THERE TO PROTECT. YOUR YOUR SAFETY IS NOT THAT'S NOT BECAUSE IT LOOKS GOOD IT'S THERE TO PROTECT YOUR HELP JUST LIKE. THE JUST LIKE THE OFFICERS. I IMAGINE THEY HAVE A CERTAIN UNIFORMS AND THEY GO IN. THEY HAVE TO WEAR ICE I SEEM CERTAIN KIND OF VAST THEY HAVE TO WEAR CERTAIN. THE DISBURSEMENT OF EQUIPMENT BEFORE THEY ENTER THE PRISON WHITE BECAUSE TO PROTECT THEIR SAFETY. THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE IN THE MATTER. I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALL IN A ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE REALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES HOTEL THIS WAS SOMEHOW. PEOPLE GIVEN A CHOICE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY TO TELL THEM YOU BETTER WEAR A MASK OR ELSE. WELL ASSEMBLY MAN I THINK I WOULD JUST DISAGREE RESPECTFULLY WITH YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF GIVING PEOPLE A CHOICE I THINK THERE WAS A VERY. FIRM AND CONSISTENT MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY AND FROM THE RECEIVER. OF EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FACE COVERINGS- WE HAD PEOPLE DOING SURVEYS TOURING FACILITIES I PERSONALLY BENDER FOURTEEN FACILITIES ESSENTIAL JULY. A PART OF WHAT I DO WHEN I WALK AROUND IS REMIND STAFF TALK TO STAFF TALK TO PATIENTS ABOUT. FACE COVERINGS I THINK THERE'S BEEN A REALLY CLEAR EXPECTATIONS- THE PART AGAIN THAT I THINK- I WAS NOT THERE WAS A PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINARY. PROCESS I THINK WE ALL HOPED THAT PEOPLE WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING. AND MOST PEOPLE I BELIEVE HALF. GOT IT GOT IT SO- YOU USE YOUR OPINION. THAT IT WAS MADE CRYSTAL CLEAR TO EVERYBODY. IN THE STATE AND YOU'D HOPED THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE NEED FOR ENFORCEMENT BUT THAT. DID NOT NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT MAYBE THAT THAT TIME HAS COME. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD CHARACTERIZATION OF SACRAMENTO OKAY. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE OUR TIME IS TO COOPER JUST TO FOLLOW UP DOCTORS MY MOM'S BEEN HOSPITAL I'VE BEEN THERE LEICESTER YES QUITE A BIT MY DAUGHTER IS A NURSE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND HOSPITALS I WATCHED ALL THE MEDICAL STAFF WERE MASK IS NOT AN OPTION SO FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES. BEING MEDICAL STAFF IT IS NOT AN OPTION THEY SHOULD BE WEARING MASK I'M IS STILL OPEN TO DEBATE IS THAT CORRECT. YES I WOULD AGREE C. C. IS A PARA MILITARIZATION IF THE CHP COMMISSIONER SAYS MASTERS YOU TO DO THIS THEY DO THAT JUST LIKE THE MILITARY DOES SO IF THE SECRETARY SAYS HEY. YOU WILL DO THIS IT'S PER MILITARY THERE'S THE FALLOUT ORDER. I MEAN IS THAT CORRECT WELL YOU YOU EXPECT WAS IN PLACE TO DO THAT CORRECT. IDEALLY THAT'S WHAT IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. SO IN. I GRANT WITH THE INMATES YOU GOT SOME INMATES ARE STRUGGLING YOU GOT THE PRISON LAW OFFICE BUT FOR THE MOST PART. YOU KNOW I'M SURE YOU GET A LARGE QUALITY THAT. WILL FOLLOW THE RULES AND DO IT. SO WHAT JUST I'M WITH MR TING STRUGGLING I MEAN. YOU KNOW IN THIS PARTICULAR MASK OFF ONCE A WHILE ON THEIR BID I GET THAT PART OF THAT. BUT WE COME THIS BUILDING EVERY DAY WE WEAR A MASK- SOLICITOR AT NINE THIRTY WE WEAR A MASK IS NOT OPTIONAL. TO BE HERE AS EMPLOYEES SO. THE INMATES I'LL GIVE YOU SOME WE ON THAT BUT AS FAR AS STAFF GOES- THERE'S NO LEEWAY. AND HERE WE ARE NINE SOON TO BE TEN MONTHS INTO THIS. AND AS MEDICAL MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. I JUST I HOPE I HOPE I HEAR YOU SAY THAT IT WAS OKAY BECAUSE- IF THEY'RE IN A HOSPITAL IN THEIR HOSPITAL STAFF. MEDICAL STAFF. THERE'S A CERTAIN EXPECTATION. FOR THAT SO I MEAN I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE. HAVING A BLOW THEIR NOSE BECAUSE IT DURING MY TIME IN THE HOSPITAL WITH MY WITH MY FAMILY MY MOTHER. EVERYBODY WERE CORRECT I DIDN'T I NEVER SAW THAT ONE PERSON. NOT WEARING YOUR PROPERTY SO THAT THAT'S THE HARD PART BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE. WITH C. C. R. SAYS DO WHAT YOU WANT. IT IS SOME ASPECTS AND THEY ARE STATE EMPLOYEES THEY HAVE A CERTAIN OBLIGATION TO FOLLOW ESPECIALLY THE MEDICAL FIELD YOU'RE HELD TO HIGHER OBLIGATION FOR YOUR STAFF SO. IT'S JUST IT'S HARD FOR SYSTEM IN AND DO THAT BECAUSE LIKE I SAID WE COME HERE. YOU GET YOUR TO PROTECT IN THE GARAGE. AND YOUR MASK IN THE COMMISSION OF A MASK ON. AND IT'S BEEN. TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND EVERYBODY IS BEEN INDOCTRINATED ABOUT HOW WE DO IT HERE. NOT JUST FOR OURSELVES BUT FOR OTHER PEOPLE. SO WE WANT TO HELP YOU GUYS GET HERE BUT IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I'LL BE HONEST IF IT'S A LEADERSHIP ISSUE. IT STARTS AT THE TOP IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW RULES IS ACCOUNTABILITY. AND YOU GET SO MANY CHANCES IN PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE STARTS AT A LOWER LEVEL. DOCUMENT COUNSELING THAT WORKS ITS WAY UP TO MORE SERIOUS THINGS. THAT SHOULD BE GOING A LONG TIME AGO SO WHICH IS. I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU IT'S SAD BUT IT'S FILL THE SHIP. WELL I HEAR YOUR FRUSTRATION MISTER COOPER AND- EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD FROM THE SECTOR IN THE RECEIVER- LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE TAKING THE NEXT STEPS AT THIS TIME TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY COMPLIES. THANK YOU OTHER OTHER QUESTIONS. NO SONORA QUESTIONS ARE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL. THANK YOU I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE PRETTY YOU TAKING ALL YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR- BEING VERY YOU KNOW FORTHRIGHT AND OPEN AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATED AND WE DO WE ALL DO KNOW YOU'RE A VERY DIFFICULT JOB SO WE ALSO DO APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'RE DOING. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO OUR SECOND PANEL ROADMAP TO INSTITUTIONAL REOPENING OF THE ABILITY TO PROGRAM. THIS IS REALLY TO. FOCUS ON ONE CONCERN HAS BEEN THE LACK OF REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AT THAT THE FACILITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC- SO. WE ARE HEARING FROM KIM SIEBEL ADOBE DIRECTOR. OF DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS. DIPPY DOCTOR SABLE. HEY. OKAY CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ME GOOD MORE OR GOOD EVENING OR AFTERNOON OR CLOSE TO EVENING OUT. OF THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION'S ROADMAP THREE OPENLY. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF COVERT NINETEEN WE'VE TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THOSE LIVING AND WORKING WITH OUR INSTITUTIONS. AS COVER NINETEEN TOUCHED OUR INSTITUTIONS WE IMPLEMENTED EXTREME MEASURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF EVERYONE ALL PROGRAMS ARE SUSPENDED TO INCLUDE VISITING EDUCATION VOLUNTEER AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION PROGRAMS. BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT EACH OF THESE AREAS ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. FOR THE- POPULATION WE DID NOT MAKE THESE DECISIONS LIGHTLY AS TIME PROGRESSED WE REALIZED ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE WILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO WORK WITHIN A NEW NOR. A NORM THAT ALLOWS FOR INCREASED MOVEMENT AND ACCESS TO PROGRAMS THUS BEGAN THE DEVELOPMENT. OF A HIGH LEVEL ROADMAP TO RE OPENING. THE ROAD MAP TO RE OPENING WAS CREATED AS A TOOL TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE DIRECTOR. OPTIONS TO OUR WARDENS AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. TO REVIEW WHEN AND HOW TO LESSEN RESTRICTIONS. MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS SUCH AS- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INNER CITY SEATS YES PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS WERE CONSULTED AND PROVIDED. VALUABLE FEEDBACK IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ROADMAP. IT WAS JUST THAT THE WAY TO MANAGED OVER NINETEEN IN THE POTENTIAL OUTBREAKS WAS IMPLEMENTED A PHASED APPROACH TO REOPEN. PHASES PROVIDED HIGHER AUTHORITIES THE BEST OPTION FOR INCREASING MOVEMENT AND PRO OFFERED. WHILE MODEL ANY IMPACTS HOUSE. WHY DOES THE ROAD IS PRO DOWN TO FOUR. PHASE ONE OF OUR MOST. FACE FACE TO EASE PHASE RUSHED. PHASE THREE. OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE OF HOUSING UNITS AND FACE FOR IS A RETURN TO OUR NEW NORMAL FOR ALL. EACH DAY INSTITUTIONS DOCUMENT THEIR CURRENT FACILITY FACE STATUS AND PROVIDE COMMENTS RELATIVE TO THEIR CURRENT STATUS AND ANY PLANS TO MOVE TO THE NEXT PHASE AND AN INTERNAL TRACKING SYSTEM. WORK AND CEOS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COLLABORATIVE COLLABORATIVE DECISION FOR WHICH THEIR INSTITUTIONS OR INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES WILL MOVE BETWEEN PHASE PHASES BASED ON CURRENT CODE BUT POSITIVES OF THEIR LOCAL INSTITUTION. WARDENS AND RADIO SHARE THEIR PLANS BUT THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSOCIATE AND REGIONAL CARE EXECUTIVES. ICAL ITEMS FOR HIGHER AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE IS THAT THERE'S NO NEW CO CASE ON A FOURTEEN DAY TOO LITTLE PERIOD TO MOVE FOR PHASE ONE TO PHASE TWO. NO NEW COBIT CASES ON A ROLLING OF DAYS TO MOVE FACE TO FACE THREE AND NO NEW CODE CASES ON A ROLLING NINETY DAY PERIOD. TO MOVE FOR PHASE THREE TO FOUR. STAFF A INMATES ARE WORKING TO KEEP CO DATA THE INSTANT. OF THE MULTITUDE TRAGEDIES EMPLOYMENT. VARIOUS FACILITIES WITHIN A PRISON MAYBE IN DIFFERENT PHASES AT DIFFERENT TIMES DUE TO THEIR DESIGN AND POPULATION NEEDS. CURRENTLY WE HAVE 46% OF OUR FACILITIES ARE PHASE ONE AND ACTUALLY 54% ARE FACE TO. BY MOVING TO FACE TO THE FACILITIES HAVE BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT LIMITED OUT OF SELF PROGRAMMING I RECENTLY WITNESSED AN EDUCATION CLASSROOM WITH SIX INMATES SOMEONE TEACHER A FURTHER WITNESSED A LIBRARY WITH INMATE WORKERS AND INMATES CONDUCTING RESEARCH AND AN INMATE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM IN ACTION WHILE WE'RE TAKING PLACE WITH APPROPRIATE MASKING. AND MAINTAINING SOCIAL DISTANCING ALBEIT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO OPERATE AT THE SAME LEVEL WERE PRIOR TO COPE WITH NINETEEN BUT WE ARE OPERATING SAFELY WITH THE TIERED APPROACH WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE COMMUNITY TO WHICH THE INSTITUTIONS RESIDE. THE INSTITUTION ARE BEING. AND THEIR CONTINUED TO KEEP COBRA NINETEEN OUT OF THE INSTITUTE. VISIT IS AN IMPORT PART OF REHAB. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE FAMILIES CAN ONCE AGAIN FOR PERSONAL CONNECTION WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. WELL MOVING FORWARD WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF VISITING PROTOCOLS FOR IN PERSON VISITING. THOSE PLANS WERE SHARED WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND OUR HEALTH CARE PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. HEEDING ADVICE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IN PERSON VISITING WOULD NOT BE THE BEST SOLUTION AT THIS TIME. BASED ON THE INCREASING COVERT NINETEEN POSITIVITY RATE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THEREFORE INSTITUTIONS WILL NOT BE IMPLEMENTING VISITING INTEL PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN APPROVED HOWEVER WHEN VISITING RESUMES IT WILL BE RESTRICTED OF CALLS RELATED TO SCREENING SOCIAL DISTANCING MASK WEARING AN ENHANCED SANITATION AND IN A PHASED APPROACH. SENSE WE WILL NOT BE IMPLEMENTING IN PERSON VISITING AT THIS TIME WE ARE PROMPTLY PRO ACTIVELY WORKING TOWARDS A VIDEO VISITING SOLUTION THAT WILL BE ROLLED OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY WORKING OUT THE LOGISTICS GROUNDWORK TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURES IN PLACE TO BEGIN IF VISITING A VIDEO COMMUNICATION SOLUTION. UNDERSTANDING THE CONCERN OF FAMILY AND LOVED ONES WE ESTABLISHED A WEBSITE DEDICATED TO EMAIL ADDRESS. A DEDICATED EMAIL ADDRESS TO KEEP THEM INFORMED IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR INCARCERATED PEOPLE HAVE CONTACT WITH THEIR LOVED ONES WE ALSO PARTNERED WITH OUR PHONE CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE. FREE CALLS TO EACH MONTH AND EXPANDED PHONE ACCESS TO CERTAIN PRIVILEGED GROUPS WE ALSO PROVIDED VIDEO GRANTS FOR FEMALE INSTITUTIONS. OF DURING THE MOTHER'S DAY WEEKEND. WE HAVE A PROGRAMS WILL BETRAY AS A ONE SIZE ALL JUST AS EACH PRISONERS MAKES TOO ARE THE PROGRAM THAT OFFER WITHIN THEM. WHEN CAN WHICH PROGRAMS TO ACTIVATE AN INSTITUTIONAL LEADERSHIP WILL CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS AS THE FEASIBILITY OF REDUCE CLASS SIZE. STAGGERED SCHEDULES AND ALTERNATIVE SITES SUCH AS OUTDOORS OR OTHER NONTRADITIONAL SPACES. ALL STUDENTS IN ACADEMIC CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND COLLEGE PARTICIPATING PROGRAMS USING INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTIONAL PACKETS. LITERACY TUTORING PRE RECORDED VIDEO LESSONS FOR TEACHERS AND EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS AVAILABLE ON THE VIEWING OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION PROGRAMS TELEVISION CHANNELS. COLLEGE COURSEWORK WAS MADE AVAILABLE BY STATE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ENROLLED STUDENTS USING DISTANCE LEARNING VIDEO CONFERENCING E. READERS AND OTHER SCHOOLS. STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING CREDITS FOR PROGRAM HOURS COMPLETED AS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE CODE RESTRICTIONS THAT IT EACH PRESENT STUDENTS ARE TAKING TESTS TO EARN MILESTONE CREDITS FOR ACADEMIC COURSEWORK AND PARTICIPATING IN BLENDED LEARNING SOME INSULTS OF FACE TO FACE. TO ACHIEVE THEIR S. C. T. PROGRAM MASTERY. AS WE MOVE FACED FACE THREE FOR EDUCATIONAL WILL BE A BLENDED INSTRUCTION- AND THEN WE FROM THERE. AND THEN LITTLE WORLD IS WITH THE- ALL PROGRAMS WHEN SAFE TO INFER WILL SHOULD PRO REALLY DISK. SOCIAL DISTANCING MASK WEARING AN ENHANCE. SO WHAT CONTINUE TO COME COME BACK CO WE EVERY DAY QUICKLY ADAPTING AND ARE HEADED IN THE RIGHT. AND I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THE EFFORTS TO DEPARTMENTS. AND HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU DEBORAH CANAL GO TO HELL. CORRECT THE RECORD MISTER BUSH MARACAY. THANK YOU NIKISCH THE L. A. WE WONDER IS A FEW ISSUES FOR CONSIDER FOR THE LEGISLATURE RECALL THE ROAD TOO REAL. AT KNOW IT IT IS BASED ON DIFFERENT WITH ONE BEING I'M RESTRICTIVE AND FACE FOR THE- WELL. ALONG BACKED NORMAL. ALLEN AND INTO TO MOVE. IT IS BASED ON THE OF AMONG INMATES AND AVAILABILITY RESOURCES TO MONITOR AND CONTAIN NINETY IN VENT OR IS AN ALPHA. LEADERSHIP INSTITUTIONS HAVE THE DISCRETION TO APPLY THE MOVEMENT BETWEEN PHASES TO THE ENTIRE INSTITUTION OR TO INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES WITHIN pCOULD RESULT IN INTERVIEWS WITH FACILITIES AT DIFFERENT PACES OF RE OPEN. AND IN SUCH A SITUATION HOW CITIES ARE MINIMIZE CROSS CONTAMINATION. FOR EXAMPLE WILL STAFF MEMBERS BE RESTRICTED TO FACILITIES IN THE SAME FACE. MOVING ON TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES DURING PHASE ONE ONLY HEALTHCARE PLANS ARE DEEMED ESSENTIAL CRITICAL ALLOWED AND A FACE TO CERTAIN SERVICES CAN RESUME SUCH A SERVICES FOR PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS- AS WELL AS TELEMEDICINE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND I PICKED A THREE OPERATE MARGIN RESUMES NORMAL. ALLEGED MIGHT WANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON WHAT SOURCES ARE ALLOWED IN PHASE ONE AND HOW THESE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE IN ADDITION THEY MIGHT WANT TO KNOW. WHAT IS BEING DONE FOR PATIENTS INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE MEDICAL RESTORE AND- WHO HAVEN'T FOR SORT THAT SUSPENDED ON BASED ON MOVING ON TO INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS- ON. THE ROADMAP DOES NOT SPECIFY. WHAT THE DENSITY OF INMATE POPULATION THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED IN INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER WE NOTE THAT CITIES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED IN THE POPULATION DENSITY IF YOU'RE ONLY RELEASES AND THE SUSPENSION OF INTAKE. THE DEPARTMENT IS CONTINUING TO RELEASE SOME INMATES ARE LATE. BUT I TOOK A DOOMED UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF INTAKE. LETITIA MIGHT ONE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON TV START TARGET POPULATION DENSITY DON'T COVER NINETEEN AND HOW THIS INTERACTS WITH THE ROAD MAP. FOR EXAMPLE AT INSTITUTIONS MOVED TO THE PHASES WHAT FUTURE BEGAN TO INCREASE THE INMATE POPULATION DENSITY AT THOSE INSTITUTIONS. MOVING ON TO INMATE PROGRAMS INSTITUTION CAN ADOPT VARIOUS OPTIONS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PROGRAM THE CITIES ARE MENTIONED INCLUDING INDEPENDENT STUDY POCKETS AND FOR INSTITUTIONS ARE FACED YOUR HIGH ARE PHYSICALLY. DISTANT IN PERSON PROGRAMS. THE NOT NO TO IN SOCIAL BEST PRACTICES AND RATIONALES FOR PROGRAMMING DECISIONS. POLITICAL MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER HAVING TO TEACH YOUR PROVIDE ROUTINE UPDATES ON THIS INFORMATION AS WELL AS WHAT PROGRAMS ARE BEING OFFERED IN PROGRAM I IN PERSON BY INSTITUTION. IN ADDITION THE LOGIC- I WOULD ASK WHY THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT DEVELOPED A STATE WIDE STRATEGY SEARCHES DIRECT IN PERSON TO PRIORITIZE RE OPENING PROGRAMS BASED ON INMATES NEEDS. DEVIC'S TENTH OCTOBER NINETEEN IS EVER SALAI THREE STAR MIGHT WANT TO ALSO. LET YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO IT. QUESTION WHAT FUTURE IS DOING TO FURTHER PREVENT. THE OUTBREAK OF COVER NINETEEN THROUGH IN PERSON PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE ART IMAGE BEING REQUIRED TO WORK AND NINETY FIVE MASCOT AND COST NOT GOING THOSE IMPORTANT PROGRAMMING. ALL RIGHT SEVEN TAKEN TO INCREASE. VENTILATION WITHIN THOSE CLASSROOMS. LETTER TO MY ALSO MY YOU CAN IF THERE ARE PRO THAT COULD BE USED CHECKS. ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING. FOR EXAMPLE THERE TO BE CITY LOST YOUR THAT WAS WITHDRAWN THAT WOULD HAVE EXPANDED ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND WIRELESS NETWORKS FOR INMATES. AND I'VE NOTED THAT BUILDING A PROGRAMMING IMPACT CREDIT ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR INMATES MY NAME IS PARTICIPATING THE PROGRAMS ARE TYPICALLY ON CREDITS WHICH REDUCE THE TIME IN PRISON AND THE BILL IT WILL BILL THE OF THESE CREDITS VARY DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PROGRAM. CHUCK CHEESE ARE MIGHT WANNA OF ILLEGITIMATE WHEN ASKED HE SHOW WHAT'S BEING DONE TO MAXIMIZE AMOUNT OF CREDITS INMATES CAN AREN'T AND HOW THAT'S BEING FACTORED IN THE DECISION OF WHAT PROGRAMS TO OFFER BY INSTITUTION. IN JULY HE'S ALRIGHT A ONE TIME PUBLIC CREDIT TO INMATES THAT DID NOT HAVE A RECENT RULES VIOLATION WHICH HELP OFFSET SOME OF THE CREDITS. LOSS DUE TO THE SUSPENDED PROGRAMMING. TO THE EXTENT THE CREDIT ON AN OPPORTUNITY FROM PROGRAMS REMAIN LIMITED. EXCEEDED YOUR CONSIDERING MAKING OTHER ANY OTHER CHANGES TO CREDITS. AND LASTLY WE KNOW THAT THOUGH IT LIKELY INTERACTION BETWEEN SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND COVE IN NINETEEN. AND IN PARTICULAR NOTE THAT THE HUSBAND LARGER THAN. DEMAND FOR MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. WITH NCC ARE WITH SIX THOUSAND PATIENTS CURRENTLY WAITING TO BE TREATED. I'M SOME WAITING SEVERAL MONTHS. FOR ALLEGED FROM MY WONDER CHOIR ABOUT WHAT STEPS HE STARTS TAKING TO ADDRESS THE SOMETIMES USES ORDERS AND DEMAND FOR M. A. T. TRYING THIS TIME. THANK YOU I HAVE AN ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU JUST COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR NOT. I'D BE INTERESTED IN THE REACTION OF THE CDC ARE TOO WHAT THE L. A. O. JUST SAID ABOUT THE METRICS NOT IN A INCLUDING. IT MADE. A DIAGNOSIS WITH COVE IT BUT NOT INCLUDING STAFF DIAGNOSIS. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE TO BE A REPEAT IT JUST TO MAKE SURE I ANSWER SO WEIRD SO YOU'RE ASKING. WHY DIDN'T WE USE STAFF. POSITIVE METRICS INTO THE PHASE APPROACHES THAT'S CORRECT YEAH IN ADDITION TRAINING WITH THE INMATES STATISTICS. SO IT- WITH OUR CURRENT POLICY- OVERLOOK PROCEDURES IF WE HAVE STAFF THAT ARE OUT SICK- LET'S SAY WITH CO BID WE WOULD FILL THE POSITIONS EITHER WITH OVERTIME OR WITH OUR CURRENT- STAFF THAT WE USED TO FILL VACANCIES. HOWEVER AT ANY GIVEN TIME- AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE PRIMARY EVEN COVERT RELATED IT COULD JUST BE OTHER REASONS WE HAD STAFF VACANCIES AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO- PROVIDE PROGRAMMING WE WOULD GO INTO A MODIFY FOR. ON THAT FACILITY SO- USING STAFF PHYLLIS'S IF AT ANY GIVEN TIME THAT WAS IMPACTED THAT WOULD JUST ON THE NATURAL- WE MIGHT HAVE TO REVERT TO ANOTHER PHASE ARE JUST GOING TO A MODIFIED PROGRAM. JUST FOR THAT DATE BUT NOT NECESSARILY FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. I UNDERSTAND BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE METRIC IS THERE TO TRY AND MEASURE THE PREVALENCE OF CODED IN THE PRISON COMMUNITY. I AM TO GATE. A PROGRESSION NAY ALL IT. ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE CASES THAT YOU FIND SO WHAT MAKES SENSE IN THAT SENSE TO INCLUDE STAFF IN THAT METRIC. I'M IT MIGHT HOWEVER IT IF WE WERE ABLE TO FILL ALL OF OUR POSITIONS WITHIN THE INSTITUTION AND STILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES WITH THE STAFFING LEVELS. ALL FILLED- I CAN'T SEE- NOT PROVIDING SERVICES IF I'M ABLE TO FILL ALL OF MY POSITIONS AND PROVIDE- ANY PROGRAMMING- AT WHAT IT DEPENDING ON WHATEVER PHASE WERE AT WITH THE STAFFING THAT WE HAVE. NOT A LOT OF WORK ONE FURIOUS AGREEMENT ON THAT I'M JEFF JUST. YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE GAUGING HOW TO PROGRESS THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES. ART SHOULD WE BE USING A BLENDED METRIC THAT INCLUDES ALL OF THE CASES WITHIN THE PRISON COMMUNITY. SO WAS REMOVED FROM FACE TO FACE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT OPENING UP FROM THE DIFFERENT PHASES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT- LET'S SAY FACE TO WERE OR PHASE THREE WERE LOOKING AT- ALLOWING OUTSIDE ENTITIES. VOLUNTEERS IF YOU WILL COMING INTO THE INSTITUTIONS WILL DEFINITELY BE LOOKING INTO WHAT IS THE CODE RED. WELL I MET IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY FOR THAT INSTITUTION. OKAY THE BUTTON THE L. A. O. JUST SAY THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE THAT THE- COPE IN SPREADING THE IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WAS NOT A PART OF THE METRIC. YES AND WE WROTE I WROTE THAT DOWN. OKAY SO I'M CONFUSED BECAUSE YOU YOU APPEAR TO JUST CONTRADICT THAT. YES HE MADE THE COMMENT HE DID MAKE THE COMMENT THAT WE DID NOT HAVE IT IN OUR PHASED APPROACH AND- I WROTE IT DOWN TO TAKE IT BACK BECAUSE THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE MIGHT WANT TO ADD AS AN ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION. OKAY. WELL I MEAN THAT THAT FOR. THE STAFF IN FRONT RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF THE- REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AS WELL AS PERHAPS THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMMING. WHAT PERCENT HAS HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO BRING ONLINE OR WHAT PERCENT IS BEING OFFERED ACROSS THE SYSTEM. SO WE CURRENTLY FOR OUR- AS FEEDBACK- CURRENTLY ARE IN MAY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAMS ARE OPERATING AT THIRTY THREE PRESENCE IN A REMOTE IN PERSON OR BLENDED MATH IT- WE ACTUALLY HAVE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE INMATES ARE RECEIVING PROGRAMMING AND THREE HUNDRED AND TEN CLASSES TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE OF THOSE ARE INTENSE ABOUT PATIENT FOURTEEN OUTPATIENT AND SEVENTY FIVE LIFE SKILLS- WE HAVE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT OF THOSE- ARE RECEIVING CLASSES IN PERSON. AND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE- OF THOSE PARTICIPATING IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN A PACKET PROGRAMMING AND THAT'S FOR- IN MAKE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER I WOULD HAVE TO GET YOU NUMBERS- ON THE OTHER COURSES. DO YOU HAVE A SENSE WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO. DO ANY OF THE REHABILITATIVE COURSES I KNOW A LOT OF THOSE ARE OFFERED BY. A NON PROFITS COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IN PERSON SO. DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE FOR THE YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO. HAVE ANY OF THEM BE OFFERED LITTLE. SO WHAT INSTITUTIONS WERE WERE AT PHASE TWO WE HAVE HAD SOME OUTSIDE- CONTRACTORS COMING IN AND PROVIDING SOME OF THOSE COURSES- AND THEY HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL. WHAT YOUR WHAT YOUR PLAN OF FOR THE PHASE ONE FACILITIES THAN. SO PHASE ONE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR- WELL FOR SUBSTANCE USE WE ARE DOING IT IN PHASE ONE- IT'S VERY LIMITED- THE CLASS SIZES ARE LIMITED THE- INSTRUCTION IN THE METHOD AND THEN ALSO WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PARTICIPATING ARE NOT OF COURSE IN OUR ISOLATION OR QUARANTINE AREAS. NEW NOTHING YOU I THINK LET ME JUST RESTATE MY QUESTION- I UNDERSTAND YOU IN A PHASE ONE YOU HAVE RESTRICTIONS FOR PEOPLE COMING INTO THE FACILITY SO ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES BEING EXPLORED TO OFFER EITHER VIRTUAL. OPPORTUNITIES OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE TO COME FACE TO FACE WITH SOMEBODY. WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT DIFFERENT OPTIONS- WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM IS WHETHER IT'S- VIA KIND OF LIKE WHAT WE'RE DING NOW OR PUTTING THEM DOING IT IN A SO. WHERE YOU HAVE DISTANCE- TO WHERE. JUST TRY TO YOU JUST HAVE A SMALLER GROUP SIZE AND SO YOU CAN HAVE EXPANDED SOCIAL DISTANCING BUT WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS TRYING TO BE CREATIVE AND THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND USE ALTERNATE LOCATIONS SURE LET ME OF THE QUESTION DIFFERENTLY. ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU DOING AT ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS ONE LOCATIONS. ARE WE DOING YES WE ARE WE ARE DOING PROGRAMMING AT SOME OF OUR FACE WITH LOCATIONS. I WOULD HAVE TO I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK ON THOSE NUMBERS SO LET ME RETRACT THAT. NO I'M JUST DUMPED ME TO ME JUST TO THE BEST INTERESTS. I GUESS I DON'T WANT TO MISS YOU SO I WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE I DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT TO SPEAK ON UNDERSTOOD. SO ON. THIS THROUGH LET'S. LET'S LET'S SAY YOU ARE WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO EXPAND THE PROGRAMMING AT THE PHASE ONE FACILITIES KNOWING THE LIMITATIONS THAT YOU HALF SO I UNDERSTAND YOU SAID YOU'RE LOOKING INTO THINGS BUT- WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME TO POTENTIALLY. IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS. SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME ON WHEN THINGS ARE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED- I KNOW WE CURRENTLY HAVE EIGHTEEN INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE DOING IN PERSON PROGRAMMING NINER DOING INSTITUTIONS ARE A HIGH OR IN PERSON ARE ANY OF THESE EIGHTEEN THINGS ONE. I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK I WOULD I DON'T HAVE A LISTING OF ALL THE STATE'S MARKS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. AND I AM BEING TOLD SOME OF THEM ARE FACED CRUNCH AND GOING TO THE PHASE ONE SO IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A PHASE ON THE WHOLE ENTIRE INSTITUTION YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE FACILITIES FACE ONE. ANOTHER FACILITY MIGHT BE IT FACE TO AND THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER FACILITY PHASE ONE OF THAT BACK TO ONE BEING A PHASE TWO. SO IF YOU'RE ASKING THAT INSTITUTION MIGHT HAVE- MULTIPLE FACILITY SUMMIT PHASE ONE SUMMIT FACE TO BUT THEY ARE RUNNING EIGHT I S. U. T. T. E. PROGRAM. GOT GOT IT SO WHEN YOU SAY FACILITY YOU MEAN LIKE YARDS OF ONE YARD MAYES. BUFFETS WERE ANOTHER GUARD MAYBE FACE TO. BUT AGAIN YOU DO NOT MOVING INMATES FROM YARD TO YARD SO IF I LIVE. IN A YARD THAT'S PHASE ONE THEN I MIGHT AS WELL BE IN A PRISON THAT'S PHASE ONE IT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T GET ACCESS TO THE PROGRAMS OF NEXT YEAR. THAT'S CORRECT THEIR PROGRAMMING AND THEIR COHORTS- AND WHEN SMALLER NUMBERS. SO THAT WE DON'T CROSS CONTAMINATE. YES SIR EXTRA I GUESS IN THE BOOKS OF. DISTINCTIONS I THINK EVEN BELIEVE MORE READ. GOING BACK DO YOU YOU I SAID LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN RIGHT NOW. TO EXPAND PROGRAM APPS ONE. FACILITIES. HEY. WE'RE WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT THE EXPANDING. WELL YOU KNOW THAT'S HOW THE STOCKS LIKE SOME SORT OF INTERRUPT YOU I'VE I'VE HAD THAT LINE. THE DEPARTMENT EVER SINCE I'VE BECOME BUDGET CHAIRMAN I'M STILL WAITING FOR A FACILITIES PLAN THAT DOESN'T EXIST THAT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS OF LOOKING INTO IT SO. I'D RATHER JUST FOCUS ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WHAT YOU'RE NOT DOING RATHER THAN WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING INTO BECAUSE- WHAT I FIND IS WHEN THE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THEY'RE LOOKING INTO SOMETHING IT MEANS THERE. NOT DOING. SO NOT THAT THAT'S TAKING THAT. SOMETIMES YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT. WE CAN PROVIDE A LIST OF EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING EVERYTHING GET THAT LIST TO YOU RIGHT AND WHAT I WOULD WHICH I WHICH I APPRECIATE WHAT I'M ABOUT. WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT DOING. TO YOU KNOW BRING BACK THE PROGRAMMING IT ALREADY HAD I MEAN. THIS THIS IS. A MAJOR CHALLENGE AYE AYE YOU KNOW YOU HEARD THE SECRETARY TALKED ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS FOR THE INMATES IN THE HOLIDAYS. YOU EXPRESSED- THE CHALLENGES WE KNOW ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS INMATES DON'T WANT TO BE MOVED IS BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAMMING. SOUL YOU KNOW WHAT BUT THE RECEIVER SAID AS WELL PROGRAM IS CHIEF FOR THE EQUITY BILITY WITHIN THE FACILITY AND BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT YARDS. SO WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO KIND OF BRIDGE THAT GAP. SO. SO I DON'T FACE WITH THE EXPANDING PROGRAMMING I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR- WHAT WAS ME JUST TELL YOU WHAT I HEAR YOU SAY THAT AND IT TELLSME WE HAVEN'T GOT AROUND TO IT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE. AND THAT'S WHAT THE INMATES ARE PROBABLY FEELING. BUT WE HAVEN'T. GOTTEN TO THAT YET. THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOUR WORDS TRANSLATE TO ME. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT DEVELOPING CREATIVE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS- AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT SPENDING EXPANDING BECAUSE WE CAN'T- IN INSTITUTIONS WERE REAR A PHASE ONE WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO BRING INMATES TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S NOT SAFE FOR THEM. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT OTHER SOLUTIONS WHERE WE CAN INCREASE PARTICIPATION WHERE WE PROVIDE MORE IN CELL TYPE- REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS TO POSSIBLY MAKE THESE REHABILITATED WHICH READING READING TYPE PROGRAMS. BUT pTHOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING WORKED ON WHERE AND WHEN WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO. START TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE. PERHAPS. HOPE TO. SOON AS THE TIME FRAME FOR ME I MEAN SINCE MY STAFF KNOWS WITH THROUGH MEANS TO ME WAS YESTERDAY. I DON'T KNOW WITH WHOM IS TO USE SO MAYBE WE COULD WE COULD USE A DATE RIGHT BY. DECEMBER BY. JANUARY FEBRUARY WHAT AS SOON. WE CAN GET J. O. A TIMELINE OF WHAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT- BUT I WOULD NEED TO WORK WITH MY DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATIVE GROUNDS- PERSONNEL AND WE CAN GET YOU A TIMELINE THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU COULD. PROVIDE A TIME WENT BY. OUR HOW WAS A WEEK A WEEK SOUNDS WONDERFUL I WOULD I WOULD THAT WOULD BE PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FROM WHAT ONE THING OF NOTE IS WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THE NONPROFIT THEY CAN DO PROGRAMMING THROUGH MAIL OR A DIFFERENT TACK CORRESPONDENCE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. YOUR DEPARTMENT IS A POTATO IT WOULD WOULD BE WILLING TO IMPLEMENT. YES WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR- OTHER WAYS- CURRENTLY WE ARE LOOKING AT WORKING WITH SOME OF OUR- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND SOME OF OUR VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS ON EXPANDING SOME INCEL TYPE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES- AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW GREAT THANK YOU WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S HINDERING THAT BECAUSE- WHAT WE HEAR FROM THE OUTSIDE IS THERE. THESE GROUPS ARE READY TO GO THEY'RE THEY'RE READY TO ROLL. SO THIS IN YOUR OPINION WOULD BE WHAT'S WHAT'S STOPPING IT IS IT IS IT A BUDGET ISSUE IS THAT. TO ISSUE WAS WITH THE ISSUE. I DON'T SEE IT AS A BUDGET ISSUE I DO KNOW THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE REACHING OUT TO OUR GREAT RECIPIENTS TO SCHEDULE MEETINGS TO GO OVER. THERE PROGRAMS AND- WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SOLICIT OR SUBMIT TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND WITHOUT OUR INSTITUTIONS AND I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE TAKING PLACE IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS THAT'S CORRECT AND WE JUST WANT TO REITERATE OUR OUR SUPPORT. ON THIS ALL I WILL I WILL READ ANY OF MY PERSONAL SUPPORT WORKER MEET ANYBODY ELSE POOR BUT THAT'S MY- THE- BOTH PROGRAMS MICE TO. IN THIS BY DURING THIS VERY CHALLENGING TIME WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T SEE FAMILIES AND- HAVE VERY LITTLE INTERACTION WITH. THE OUTSIDE WORLD- I JUST URGE YOU TO.

ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS DELORES GUNS ALICE I AM WITH THE YOUNG ONES FREEDOM CENTER AND I AM ALSO FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND HAVE A FORMALLY INCARCERATED LOVED ONE WELL I THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT WAS A VERY REST TIME FRAME AND SO MANY FAMILY MEMBERS. ARE NOT EVEN ABLE TO LISTEN IN TODAY OR SHOW UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND I KNOW THAT THEY WOULD BE HERE IF POSSIBLE. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE SYSTEMS SOME SUGGESTIONS TO BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT ASSEMBLY IS ANY PROCEDURES- WE ALL KNOW JUST. EVERYBODY'S REALIZING JUST HOW ISOLATED ALONE WE ARE ALL FEELING THERE'S MANY FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE SPENT DECADES OF HOLIDAYS. VISITING THE PRISON SO NOW YOU HAVE THEM INSIDE THE PRISON BETTER FEELING ISOLATED AND ISOLATED AND ALONE DURING THE HOLIDAYS. BUT ALSO THE SEVERE SEPARATION OF FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE OUT HERE NOW IT WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SITTING IN PRISON VISITING ROOM WITH THEIR LOVE ONE. AND IF WE COULD START TO JUST START LIKE A PILOT PROGRAM WITH THE FAMILY VISITING IF THEY GET A CALL THE TEST BEFORE THEY GO TO THE FAMILY VISIT. AND THEN THE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S GETTING THE VISIT GOING TO A FOURTEEN DAY TYPE QUARANTINE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO SUGGEST TO START TO IMPLEMENT PILOT PROGRAM VISITING. TO START TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMMING AND I THINK THE PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT AS I'M LISTENING TO EVERYBODY. EVEN IF EVERYBODY WAS GOING ON AND ON ABOUT THE MASS AND I THINK IT'S ASSEMBLY COOPER EVEN MENTIONED AT ONE POINT WHERE LIKE A DOG CHASING A TALE. AND I FEEL THAT THAT'S CONSTANTLY GOING TO BE THE WAY THAT IT IS BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO RUN THESE CORRECTION FACILITIES WITHOUT EVER HAVING ACTUALLY LIVED IN THEM. SO WHILE WE BLAME EVERYTHING ON THE HOUSING STAFF AND NOW CAUSING MORE FRUSTRATION WITH THE HOUSING DEFICIT WE SUGGEST YOU WRITE THEM UP.
