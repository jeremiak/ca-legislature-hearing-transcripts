FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS A. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS A LONG OVERDUE BILL THAT WE HAVE SEEN THIS LEGISLATURE ON A REGULAR BASIS. BACK IS THE THIRD YEAR. OF THAT I'M INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND IF YOU'RE DOING THE MATH I'VE BEEN HERE NOW FOR MY IS MY THIRD YEAR SO IT'S SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND SO MANY OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ALL WATCHED THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FINANCIAL CRISIS PLUNGED OUR STATE INTO THE GREAT RECESSION HAVE PRECIPITATED DEVASTATING CUTS OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS INCLUDING CALIFORNIA SOCIAL SECURITY INSURANCE STATE SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENT PROGRAM. SS I SS BE GRANTS OF THE SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME FOR ONE POINT THREE MILLION LOW INCOME SENIORS AND PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. IT HELPS THESE INDIVIDUALS PAY RENT BUY FOOD PAPER UTILITIES PAY FOR MEDICINE AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES. AT ITS PUREST THE SS I SS P. PROGRAM IS A DEFINING COMPONENT OF OUR STATES SOCIAL SAFETY NET. STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND NINE IN AN EFFORT TO CLOSE UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET DEFICITS THE STATE REDUCE TO REDUCE ITS PORTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY AS A SPEAK GRANT. AFTER REPEATED CUTS SS I SS BE GRANTS ARE CURRENTLY AT NINE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE DOLLARS PER MONTH ON THE 88% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. A LESS THAN THE AMOUNT PROVIDED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE FOR THE CUTS. IN MANY COUNTIES THE COST OF LIVING FOR A STUDIO APARTMENT FAR EXCEEDS THE TOTAL SSI AS A SPEAK GRANT PROVIDED. AND BEAR MARKET WHEN EXCEEDS 50% THE MAXIM SS I SS BE GRANT FOR INDIVIDUAL IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AS A RESULT SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS BEEN FORCED INTO POVERTY BECOMING HOMELESS GOING HUNGRY OR FACING SEVERE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISES. WE ARE NOW PROJECTED TO HAVE A BUDGET SURPLUS OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. YOU MUST TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RESTORE THE CUTS MADE A DECADE AGO TO THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM AND KEEPING IN MIND THAT. OVER. TEN YEARS OF THESE CUTS LITERALLY THOSE THAT HAVE THE LEAST ABILITY TO AFFORD IT. HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SAVINGS -- OVER TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE PAY THEM BACK. I AM NOT EVEN PAY THE BACK IN TERMS OF SOMETHING THAT'S OWED TO THEM BUT REALLY -- IT'S IT'S PAYING BACK OURSELVES IN TERMS OF MAINTAIN THE TO THE DIGNITY OF THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY IN OUR STATE. AB FORTY THIRTY FOUR WILL HELP PROTECT THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION AND MORE IMPORTANTLY PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN DIGNITY NOT POVERTY. WITH THE TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY AS CARTER POWER BAGS IN A LOCK DOWN NATION OF SILICON VALLEY. AND CHRISTIE'S TO POVERTY -- BURCHETT OF EDUCATE ADVOCATE.

THAT MEANS I'M DEALING DAILY WITH PUBLIC PUBLIC BENEFITS ISSUES AND I'M FIGHTING DAILY FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT OUR CLIENTS NEED IN ORDER TO LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE -- AS A RESULT WE ARE INCREDIBLY EXCITED AND INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE OF FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR AND SO GRATEFUL -- FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AS SUPPORT OF THESE ISSUES -- AS WELL AS OUR AREA. HUNDRED DOLLARS IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST ABOUT A NUMBER FOR MY CLIENTS IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ABLE TO AFFORD. COUGH AND COLD MEDICINE -- THAT DOESN'T LEAD TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT IN THE FUTURE WHEN THAT COUGH IT DOESN'T GET BETTER. WITH THE DIFFERENCE BEING ABLE TO BE MOVED OUT OF BED BUG INFESTED ROOMS AND THAT PATH OFF THE STREETS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HEAT ELECTRICITY AND VIABLE CLOTHING. THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND WE TAKE SO MUCH FOR GRANTED THAT WE GET TO JUST GET FAT AND THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS. AND THOSE SHORT TERM HEALTH OUTCOMES LEAD TO LONG TERM HEALTH OUTCOMES AND WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR HELP IN THE SHORT TERM THE LONG TERM. THAT'S WHERE WE GET THESE MASSIVE BURDENS -- ON AND OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMS [inaudible] AS WELL. PERSONALLY -- MY CLIENT WILL TRAVEL OVER THREE HOURS THERE AND BACK ON BUS JUST TO TALK TO ME. TO HELP. CHANGE THEIR BENEFIT AMOUNTS BY TEN OR FIFTEEN DOLLARS.

OF AB TEN SIXTY EIGHT CLC REPRESENTS A PROXY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEPENDENCY COURT LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO PLASTER COUNTY. AND WE HAVE SEEN SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CF TEASE WITHIN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. AND I THINK THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED -- BY THE AUTHOR -- WE'RE LOOKING -- FOR YOU KNOW A NEUTRAL FACILITATOR AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS HOLDERS TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. TO ADDRESS INFORMATION SHARING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS PROPER NOTICE TO BE GIVEN -- SO WE ARE HERE AS SPONSORS AND IN STRONG FOR SUPPORT AND ASK FOR YOUR IBM THANK YOU AND I DO. THANK YOU COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I DO WANT TO KNOW THANK YOU RECORD I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE. WHEN I APOLOGIZE WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE PRETTY GOLDBERG SHE IS A RESOURCE PARENT VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS THE UP TO PROCESS AND SHIP LIKE TO SHARE? GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SEEING ME TODAY MY NAME IS FOR THE GOLD BURKE I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I AM THE RESOURCE PARENT TO MY TWO YEAR OLD GRANDSON I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN MANY CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM MEETINGS AND I BELIEVE THE CHANGES OFFERED BY A. B.. TEN SIXTY EIGHT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT CARE GIVERS AND CHILDREN ARE TRULY HEARD IN THESE MEETINGS. FIRST I THINK HAVING A NEUTRAL FACILITATOR. FOR THESE MEETINGS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE SECOND SOCIAL WORKER ASSIGNED TO MY GRANDSONS CASE FACILITATED A CHILD A FAMILY TEAM MEETINGS. THIS DID NOT ALLOW FOR OPEN CONVERSATION BECAUSE OF OUR PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP AND THE IMPRESSION OF THE SOCIAL WORKER IMPACTED OF OUR LEVEL OF COMFORT TO BE ENGAGED DURING THESE MEETINGS. WE FELT THAT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MEETINGS WERE ALREADY PRE DETERMINED BY HER. WITH THE HELP OF MY CARE GIVER ADVOCATE WE WERE ABLE TO ASK FOR SUPPORTS LIKE FINANCIAL HELP FOOD STAMPS AND GAS CARDS HOWEVER SHE WAS ALWAYS QUICK TO SAY THAT SHE COULD NOT ASSIST WITH THESE REQUESTS. WE NEVER RECEIVED ANY OF THE SUPPORTS OUR SERVICES WE ASK FOR AND FELT LIKE NOTHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN THESE MEETINGS. I ALSO BELIEVE IN THE PROVISION IN AB TEN SIXTY EIGHT TO PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH SUFFICIENT NOTICE BEFORE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM MEETING IS CRITICAL. WE NEVER RECEIVED ADVANCE NOTICE OF THE MEETINGS THE MOST NOTICE I RECEIVED WITH LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND THEREFORE I HAD TO MAKE MIGHT REARRANGE MY SCHEDULE SCRAMBLE TO GET THINGS DONE. MAKE SURE MY GRANDSON WAS TAKEN CARE OF OR BE LATE TO OTHER MEETINGS AND COMMITMENTS THAT I HAD ALREADY ON MY CALENDAR. IT WAS VERY STRESSFUL AND VERY BURDENSOME. MY FAMILY AND I ARE NOT THE EXCEPTION I HAVE TALKED AND WORKED WITH OTHER GRANDPARENTS THROUGH AN ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS THE ALLIANCE FOR RELATIVE CARE GIVERS. AND THEY SHARE THE SAME EXPERIENCES THAT I HAVE. THERE NEEDS TO BE PROPER NOTICE AND BETTER FOR THOSE FACILITATION OF CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM MEETINGS WHICH IS WHY I AM IN SUPPORT OF AB. TEN SIXTY EIGHT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND A VOTE. THANK YOU THANK ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. PLEASE GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION.

WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER GIBSON SECOND BY MISTER STONE PLEASE TAKE THE ROLE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RIGHT YES I REYES AYE MATHIS. BERMAN CHOI FRIEDMAN. GIPSON. GIPSON I MAIENSCHEIN STONE. STONE AYE. KERN VOTE IS. THREE I WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU. MISTER GIBSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT [inaudible] THE SHE GETS AND YOU'LL BE PRESENTING ON ITEM. NUMBER THIRTY AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER. LEVINE. SEKARANG THAT IS CORRECT THANK YOU. AND IS WAITING FOR MY HELP TO SHOW OKAY. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO CONTRACT WITH A NON PROFIT LEGAL SERVICE ORGANIZATION. TO PROVIDE IMMIGRATION SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. WHAT CALIFORNIA ALREADY A REQUIRES THAT ON A COMPANY AND UNDOCUMENTED MINORS WHO ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE CUTS THE OFFICE OF THE REFUGE ARE RESETTLEMENT -- BE PROVIDED WITH A LEGAL SERVICE THIS PROTECTION DOES NOT EXTEND TO UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN. WHO ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE CALIFORNIA FOSTER YOUTH SYSTEM? ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT ON THAT UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA FOSTER CARE SYSTEMS ARE. PROVIDED WITH ESSENTIAL IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICE NECESSARY TO SEEK LAWFUL -- RESIDENCY IN THE UNITED STATES HERE WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TESTIMONY BUT THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR IS A REPRESENT THE EXACT DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL SERVICES OF CALIFORNIA LEGAL SERVICES. FOR CHILDREN WHOSE SELF INTRODUCE. SORRY ACTUALLY I THINK I'LL TELL AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR LEGAL SERVICES FOR CHILDREN COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. BUT I AM ODESSA VERY POWERS SOMEONE IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY WITH THE CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER OF CALIFORNIA WE WELCOME YOU WOULD YOU BRING THAT. THE MICROPHONE CLOSE SHE THANK PASSIVELY. SO WHAT THE CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND YOUTH UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEPENDENCY COURT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WE THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- GIPSON FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIVINGS BEHALF. THIS BILL WILL PROTECT UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE BY ENSURING THAT THEY ARE PROVIDED WITH LEGAL IMMIGRATION SERVICE AS WELL MOST UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN FOSTER CARE QUALIFY FOR IMMIGRATION RELIEF. THAT RELIEF IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN IT WITHOUT LEGAL ASSISTANCE ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S POLITICAL CLIMATE. SPECIAL MCCANN JUVENILE STATUS WHICH IS ALSO CALLED SUGGESTS WAS ENACTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP ABUSED ABANDONED AND NEGLECTED UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN. OBTAIN LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENCY IN THE UNITED STATES. AND IN TURN PROVIDE GREATER STABILITY FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO LEAVE FOSTER CARE WITHOUT OBTAINING SUGGESTS OR OTHER FORMS OF AND IMMIGRATION RELIEF. WILL BE UNABLE TO WORK AND TO TRANSITION TO SUCCESSFUL ADULTHOOD. HOWEVER THERE IS NO MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE RECEIVE THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE NECESSARY TO OBTAIN IMMIGRATION RELIEF. AS A RESULT THE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE THAT THE YOUTH GETS ON THERE IMMIGRATION MATTER VARIES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. FOR EXAMPLE IN COUNTY SUCH AS SACRAMENTO OUR LAWYERS HAVE TO SCRAMBLE TO GET AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY OR A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION TO REPRESENT OUR CLIENT. AND LOS ANGELES THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY WORKS CLOSELY WITH OUR ATTORNEYS TO IDENTIFY A LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. AND PRO BONO ATTORNEYS WHO WILL PROVIDE IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES FOR OUR CLIENTS. WE HAVE ALSO HEARD STORIES FROM OTHER COUNTIES. WHERE NO IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES ARE OBTAINED AND AS A RESULT THE YOUTH NEVER RECEIVE THE RELIEF THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO AND EVENTUALLY LEAVE THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WITHOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS? AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR WILL PREVENT UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN FROM LEADING FOSTER CARE WITHOUT IMMIGRATION RELIEF. BY REQUIRING NOTICE TO MINORS COUNCIL WHEN A CHILD OR NON MINOR DEPENDENT IS UNDOCUMENTED AND IN NEED OF SUGGEST OR OTHER IMMIGRATION RELIEF. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR WILL ALSO CREATE A FUNDING SOURCE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. TO CONTRACT WITH NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION AND ASSISTANCE TO UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN AND NON MINOR DEPENDENCE IN CALIFORNIA. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. RESIDENTS ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JOHN CHILDREN WITH THE ALLIES FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS FOR IN STRONG SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHAT THIS IS IN OPPOSITION? SEEING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MISTER GIBSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. ABSOLUTELY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE. THANK YOU DR EMOTION SO MOVED. CAN I DO HAVE MOTION BY MISTER GIBSON SECOND BY MISTER STONE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RIGHT YES. I REYES I MATHIS [inaudible] BERMAN [inaudible] CHOI [inaudible] FRIEDMAN. GIPSON. AYE GIPSON AYE MAIENSCHEIN STONE STONE AYE.

OTHER TEAMS GATHER GATHERING THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN OH THREE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN CARILLO-- WHICH WOULD CORRECT THAT OVERSIGHT IN THE STATE LAW TO ENSURE THAT DEEPLY IMPOVERISHED INDIVIDUALS CAN APPLY FOR CRITICAL RESOURCES WHEN THE CALIFORNIA AT WORK OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY. FOR KIDS CAL WORKS PROGRAMS WAS ENACTED IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT CAL WORKS PARENTS WHO HAVE TIMED OUT. OF BUT WE'RE WAS RECEIVING A FOR THEIR CHILDREN ARE NOT ALSO RECEIVING GENERAL ASSISTANCE TODAY THE LAW STATES. THAT IF A PARENT WHO IS NOT RECEIVING CAL WORKS WITH CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN WHO ARE IN FOSTER CARE. HAVE DIED FOR A RUN AWAY CANNOT RECEIVE GENERAL ASSISTANCE AB FORTINO THREE CORRECTS THE STATE LAW AND LIMIT GENERAL ASSISTANCE BEFORE PARENTS WHO IS NOT RECEIVING CAL WORKS BENEFITS. IF OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE WITH ME TO PROVIDE -- SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF FOURTEEN OH THREE OKAY -- WILL BE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE WESTERN CENTER OF LAW AND POVERTY IN ADDITION -- TO COALITION FOR CALIFORNIA'S WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION THEY WAS SELF INTRODUCE [inaudible] FIRST WITNESS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DESK OF OUR CLUB IN THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE ARE CO SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION -- AS PEOPLE NOTE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IS FIFTY YEARS OLD THE BILL AT THE CAPITOL FOR MORE THAN. FORTY AND WE WERE HERE DURING WELFARE REFORM -- THIS WELFARE REFORM WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANTED TO SEE HAPPEN BUT WE WERE DILIGENTLY PARTICIPATE IN THOSE PROCESS SEES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LAW THAT WE ARE. WORKING TO REFINE NOW -- DEAL THAT WOULD FIX AN OVERSIGHT. WHEN WE ESTABLISHED WELFARE TO WORK AND THE NEW TIME LIMITS WE SAID THAT PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET AROUND THE TIME OF THIS IN THE COLORS PROGRAMS? BY SIMPLY SANCTIONING OFFER NOT PARTICIPATING IN WELFARE TO WORK AND THEN GOING OVER TO THE GENERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN THE COUNTY. AND IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW THAT WE HAVE THE WORD BENDING TODAY. HOWEVER AS THE YEARS GO BY AND MORE -- PERRANCE A SANCTION OFF AID BECAUSE OF THE TIME LIMIT. AND THEN THEY BECOME DESTITUTE AND WITH ECONOMIC HARDSHIP MANY OF THEM FALL INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY LOSE THEIR CHILDREN THEY LOSE CUSTODY OF THEIR CHILDREN OR THEIR CHILDREN FALL INTO HARD TIMES. THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN A HALL. AT REPORT CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE HOSPITALIZED APPARENTLY SEC AND SO THEY MAY GO INTO THE HOSPITAL LONG TERM. AND THEIR PARENT REMAINS AT HOME WITHOUT A CHILD IN THEIR HOME. TODAY'S LAW MAKES A PERSON. WHO THE A SINGLE ADULTS WITHOUT CHILDREN? IN ELIGIBLE FOR GENERAL ASSISTANCE. IF AT ONE POINT IN THE PAST. THEY WERE SANCTIONED OFF AID. EVEN IF THEY HAVEN'T HAD CUSTODY OF THEIR CHILD FOR YEARS. EVEN IF THEY'RE TRYING TO RETAIN CUSTODY OF THEIR CHILDREN HAVING ACCESS TO GA WOULD HELP THEM TO DO THAT. WE THINK THAT'S AN ERROR IN THE LAW WE WILL WE ARE ASKING THROUGH THIS BILL THAT IT BE FIXED -- AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS THE COMMITTEES RECEIVED A LETTER OF CONCERN FROM THE COUNTY IS -- AND FROM C. W. D. A. AND AND I'LL LET THEM TESTIFY TO THEIR POSITION -- BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AND AND WE BELIEVE THAT. THESE ARE THEIR CONCERNS ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN WORK ON I WITH THAT -- I WILL CLOSE AND AFTER I VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT WITH A KEVIN AS THE COALITION CALIFORNIA ROUGH RIGHT SIR GUYS ISSHIN. THIS BILL BASICALLY FIXES AN OVERSIGHT THAT WAS DONE. BECAUSE OF DRAFTING ERROR OF THE WATER BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ATTENDANT THAT A WOMAN. WHO HAS -- WHO HAS NOTHING? LIVE IN THE STREETS RATHER THAN GETTING GENERAL ASSISTANCE AND HOPEFULLY GET OFF THE STREETS SO WE ARE DRIVE WITH THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I'M CONCERNED WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE ME. TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OR WITH CONCERNS. THANK YOU ADJUSTING GARETH CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WERE NOT OPPOSITION BUT WE DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS AS A GESTURE WITH YOU -- SO GENERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ARE ENTIRELY UNDER PERCENT COUNTY FUNDED -- AND EACH COUNTY HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE THEIR OWN DETERMINATIONS OF ELIGIBILITY AND I'M BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO THOSE PROGRAM SO WE'VE EXPRESSED SOME. CONCERNS RELATED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THIS BILL AS WELL AS LOCAL COST CONCERNS -- AS WAS MENTIONED THAT WE'VE WE SHARE THESE CONCERNS WITH BOTH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR -- OUR PRIMARY CONCERN RELATES TO THE LANGUAGE WE BELIEVE GOES BEYOND THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR TO ALSO OPEN UP -- J. BENEFITS TO THOSE WHO ARE SANCTIONED ARE PENALIZED AND I WITH -- APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSIONS ON THOSE -- AND SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER -- TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS -- LOOKING FOR WITH THIS BILL AND APPRECIATE THE OPENNESS OF THE AUTHOR -- IN RESPONSE ON THAT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SAYING NOW LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MR STONE. SOME HAVE MISS KOREA THANK YOU FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD. I THINK THIS ALSO MAYBE WAS DRAFTING ERROR BUT IN OUR ZEAL. YEARS AGO NOT OURS BUT IN THIS. ZERO TO CONTROL OR DENY PEOPLE BENEFITS ACROSS THE BOARD. WE WE CAUSAL A VERY WE CREATE A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM. THAT DENIES PEOPLE AND IS WAS REALLY SET UP TO DO THAT. SO ANY ATTEMPT THAT WE'RE MAKING NOW TO KIND OF CHIP AWAY AT THE IRRATIONALITY OF THOSE SYSTEMS THE THESE ABILITY TO DENY PEOPLE THESE BILLION TO SORT OF SET UP ALL OF THE HURDLES THAT WE SET UP IS REALLY A GOOD THING. I WOULD HOPE AT SOME POINT WE COULD DO A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK. AT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE THE ENTITLEMENT SYSTEM TO LOOK LIKE VERSUS HOW IT'S BEEN COBBLED TOGETHER AS WE SORT OF PEACE THESE THINGS TOGETHER THEN WE WOULD HAVING A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF HOW TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE. BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE ULTIMATELY WE WE DON'T WANT TO BE. THE NINE PEOPLE ACCESS TO BENEFITS THAT REALLY HELP THEM GET OUT OF POVERTY THAT THAT THE SYSTEM IN THE COMMUNITIES. WE GET OUR SYSTEM DOES THAT. BECAUSE OF OUR YOU COULD CYNICALLY SAY WAS INTENTIONAL BUT I THINK IT WAS THAT A LOT OF WAYS. TO DENY ACCESS TO IT A NUMBER OF FOLKS SO IT'S GOOD THAT WE'RE WORKING AT THIS BUT I THINK THE FRUSTRATION IS IS WE'RE JUST SORT OF LOOKING AT BITS AND PIECES AND YES I'VE GOT SOME BILLS IN THIS AREA AS WELL. BUT I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK MORE COMPREHENSIVELY AT SOME POINT AT THE OVERALL SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RATIONAL AND THAT WE'RE HELPING THE PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO HELP. SO OUT ALL MOVE THE BILL.

TO THEN GOVERNOR REAGAN WHO CREATED THE LANHAM ACT THERE WAS STILL A PHILOSOPHY THAT A SOCIETY WOULD BE JUDGED ON HOW IT TREATS ITS MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS. IN THIS CASE THE PARENTS ARE BEING DENIED THERE EITHER WAY TO RURAL AND THEY CAN'T GET RESPITE OR THEY HAVE MINIMUM WAGE JOBS THEY NEED TO KEEP OR THEIR THEIR CHILD'S OWN CARE GIVER. THERESHOULD BE. EITHER THROUGH THE STATE COUNCIL THROUGH THE AREA BOARDS INDEPENDENT ADVOCATE THAT DON'T COST MONEY THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO THEY CAN GET THEIR CHILDREN WHAT THEY NEED.

AND DAYS PAST MY CASE MANAGER WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THESE MEETINGS OR THESE REVIEWS IF HE'S NOT GETTING ANY SERVICES FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER. AND SHE SAID JUST TO KEEP THEM IN THE SYSTEM. I IN APRIL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN JEREMY BECAME INCREASINGLY MORE VIOLENT TOWARDS ME. AND HE STOPPED WEARING HIS SEATBELT AND HE WOULD HIT ME AND KICK ME AS I WAS DRIVING -- I WAS KERN CONCERNED FOR HIS SAFETY MY SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. I CALLED A CASE MANAGER AND HOW TO COME BACK OUT TO THE HOME. BECAUSE I NEEDED HELP. AND AT THAT TIME SHE SAID HE QUALIFIED FOR RESPITE SERVICES. AND BEFORE SHE LEFT SHE'S GONNA MAIL ME APPEAL LESS AND THIS WAS AN I APRIL. I START SPENDING LESS AND LESS TIME WITH JEREMY AND AND NEEDED THE RESPITE SUPPORT SO I CAN SPEND TIME WITH MY SON -- THE CASE MANAGER CALLED ME A MONTH LATER.

THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION. I WILL SECOND IT. BUT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS MR FRAZIER -- AND SOME COMMENTS. CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CURRENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE. TWO RIGHT NOW. THEY YOUR SUBMITTED A SEVEN PAGE DOCUMENT. THAT IN THE IN THE MIDST OF IT SOMEWHERE. IS THE ABILITY THAT YOU CAN. WHAT I'VE FOUND IN MY TRAVELS IS A MOST PARENTS? NOTE ONLY GO TO THE SERVICE COORDINATOR IT'S NOT ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE SERVICE COORDINATOR THE DENIAL HAPPENS. USUALLY IT STEPS UP TO MAYBE THE SUPERVISOR OF THE OF THE SERVICE COORDINATOR. AND THEN IN DIDN'T MISS CAL WAYS OF SITUATION WHEN THAT HAPPENED. BOTH TEAMED UP HONOR AND SCREAMED AT HER OVER THE TELEPHONE [inaudible] THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE. THAT BEING SAID. WE HAD A TOWN HALL AND BRENT WOULD I BELIEVE IT WAS ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO AND WAS VERY KIND OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE REGIONAL CENTER TO COME OUT. FOR ME STAY. FIRST TIME EVER. BUT THERE WAS OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE. AND IT WAS STANDING ROOM ONLY. BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE WERE THIRSTY FOR INFORMATION ON HOW. THEY COULD ACTUALLY BE SERVED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER. THAT BEING SAID. THE EXACT ADDRESS EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED IF IT EVER GOT TO HER LEVEL [inaudible] EVER. ALL THE NILES WERE GENERALLY APPROVED. SO THIS LEVEL OF GATEKEEPING SCOTT A STOCK. AND IF THE PARENTS KNOW THAT THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO GO TO A DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS IF THEY'RE DENIED BUT LET ME SHARE WITH YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN. THERE NEVER TOLD WHAT THEY CAN QUALIFY. FOR THERE'S NO MENU OF SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED. SO THERE AT THE AT THE ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE. WILL OF THE SERVICE COORDINATOR COORDINATOR YES THEY HAVE THE ADEQUATE TRAINING. TO BE ABLE TO ADMINISTER TO THAT CHILD OR ADULT. I'M JUST ASKING THAT WE START A PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY EVERYBODY HAS A FAIR CHANCE. BECAUSE IN THIS CULTURE. IT'S THE CULTURE OF NO. THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN. THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND IF WE CAN ACTUALLY AND I BELIEVE THERE WERE BACK IN A TIME PERIOD WINDOW. STATE WAS ACTUALLY MORE ENGAGED. THERE WAS THIS PROCESS AND REGIONAL CENTERS. GOING FOR BUT IT WAS DEMISED. I WANT TO GET BACK TO THAT SO THE PEOPLE THAT I CARE ABOUT. THE ID POPULATION CAN FLOURISH. WILL YOUR BILL. INTERACT WITH THE EXISTING -- PROCESS FOR APPEALS. SO WHAT WE'RE HOPING. FOR IS TO START A DIALOGUE. THIS BILL IS JUST IN HOPES THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM. AND THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. THAT ACTUALLY KNOWLEDGE IS THAT. THE PEOPLE'S THE PARENTS VOICES MATTER. THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SERVICES. AND IF THE ONLY WAY THEY ACTUALLY LEARN TO HELP GET SERVICES HIS REPAIR NETWORKS BLOGS AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WE HAD TO BEG. THE REGIONAL SERVICE BAY TO ACTUALLY PUT THE MENU OF SERVICES. ON THEIR WEBSITE. ALL I'M ASKING IS A FAIR CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO START A PROCESS TO THE PARENTS HAVE A VOICE. AND HOW THAT HAPPENS I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO WORK MADAM CHAIR. TO MAKE SURE THAT PROCESS HAPPENS. WONDERFUL IT. NOW WHAT ABOUT PAYMENT FOR THE SERVICE IF FOR HAVING A DISPUTE RESOLUTION NSIDE ORGANIZATION BUT WILL THIS BE FREE TO THE CONSUMER TO THE PARENTS YES MA'AM OKAY. MR HOLDEN AND I HAVE A BILL THAT AUGMENTS. THE REGIONAL CENTERS IN PROVIDERS BY TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IT'S AN EIGHT AND I KNOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE STATE PERCENT BRIDGE MONEY. AS YOU AS YOU SAW THAT WHEN THE RATE STUDY CAME OUT. THAT WE'VE BEEN UNDER FUNDING. UNDER FUNDING THE ID POPULATION BY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] THAT'S CRIMINAL. IT IS A WE'RE HEARING FROM JUSTICE MISTER KALRA PRESENTED. ON SS I SS P. -- WITH THE WITH THE BUDGET PROBLEMS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IT'S ON THE BACKS OF THE LEAST. THEN THE MOST VULNERABLE THE LEAST. ABLE TO WITHSTAND IT -- THE THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM AS WE KNOW SERVICE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. EACH OF WHOM HAS VARYING NEEDS. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THOSE NEEDS BE MET. AND THAT THERE IS RECOURSE WHEN THEY ARE NOT. CLEARLY WE HAVE EXAMPLES WHERE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN MET. WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT. AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS HAVE RECOURSE WHEN SERVICES ARE DENIED. OR WHEN THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT A DECISION REGARDING THE SERVICE. BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE PROCESS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE. USES THE RESOURCES EFFICIENTLY. AND THAT WE ARE REDUNDANT. WITH THE CURRENT PROCESS IT'S BEING USED. IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE PROCESS WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT. BECAUSE IF IT IS BEING OFFERED TO FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION BEING USED IMPROPERLY WE CERTAINLY NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THE VOICE OF CONSUMERS. THEIR FAMILIES ARE REPRESENTATIVES AND ADVOCATES ARE HEARD. AND THAT THEY BE THE DRIVING FACTOR BEHIND THIS CHANGE I DO WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE YOU ARE CHAMPION. FOR THE COMMUNITY IN THIS AREA AND YOUR VOICE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND IT'S CLEAR TO ME WHEN YOU HAVE A TOWN HALL. THAT YOU HAVE THE COMMUNITY COME OUT IN MY HOUSE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY WILL BE HEARD THAT YOU WILL BE SURE TO BRING THE RIGHT ADVOCATES TO WHATEVER HEARING YOU HAVE. SO I DO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WE DO HAVE A MOTION. BY MISTER GIBSON AND THE SECOND BY ME. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE HIS MANAGER AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KIND CONSIDERATION. I KNOW YOU TO BE THE CHAMPION ALSO OF ALL UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. I BEG. TO TO BE IT. PUT ON BUDGET SUB ONE WHICH YOU'RE NOW THE CHAIR. I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH. NOT ONLY FROM YOU BUT FROM THE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME. BEFORE US. ON HOW WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB. IN THE STATE. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RATE STUDY THE CAME OUT? AND WE LOOK AT OTHER AGENCIES THAT HAVE NOT FUNDED SINCE THE RECESSION. AND BROUGHT US BACK. TO WHERE WE SHOULD BE EVEN WITH THE COST OF INFLATION OR INDEXING. GOING FORWARD I WILL TELL YOU THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO AS A POPULATION WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND CATCH BACK UP. WE NEED TO CATCH BACK UP. AND RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM. AND IT'S BEEN SAID BY A MOTHER. THE RIGHT NOW THE ID POPULATION IS B. GROUP BEING PREPARED. TO GO GROUPON'S. NOT TO FLOURISH. AND THAT'S NOT FAIR. IT'S NOT RIGHT IT IS NOT RIGHT. WITH THAT [inaudible] I ABSOLUTELY.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBER. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES MEMINTA THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AB FOR FIFTY TWO SIX TO CONVERT THE CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE FACILITIES REVOLVING FUND. INTO THE CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE FACILITIES GRANT TO FUND. REPORTS OF THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE LAST DECADE REFLECT THAT THE FUND HAS BEEN SEVERELY UNDER UTILIZED. DURING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FISCAL YEAR THE REVOLVING FUND DID NOT RECEIVE A SINGLE APPLICATION. RECOMMENDATIONS TO OVERHAUL THE FUNDING CONVERTED TO A GRAND FUND HAVE COME FROM BRIEFS BY THE ADVANCEMENT PROJECT IN A DRAFT OF THE SPEAKERS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY CHRISTOPHER MERRICK CALL. UP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HEAD START CALIFORNIA AND TAP WITH THE THOMPSON HEAD START DIRECTOR WITH TWIN RIVERS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A CUSTOMER GO HEAD START CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY HEAD START GRANTEES SERVING OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST AT RISK CHILDREN. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN FOR BRINGING FORTH THE LEGISLATION AND TWO IS CO AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. WE KNOW THERE'S A VERY LARGE SERVICE GAP IN THIS AREA AND THE NEED FOR INFANT AND TODDLER CARE FAR OUTSTRIPS AVAILABILITY. THERE ARE BARRIERS TO REDUCING THAT GAP AND FACILITIES IS ONE OF THEM. ACCORDING TO A MAY TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY BY THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THERE WAS AN ESTIMATED HERE TO TO WHO NEEDED. BUT DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CHILDCARE JUST IN THE SAN JOSE SUNNYVALE SANTA CLARA METROPOLITAN AREA. THE COUNTY OFFICE ESTIMATED THE AVERAGE COST FOR FACILITIES TO SERVE TWENTY CHILDREN. AT EIGHT ZERO TWO AT ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION FOR PORTABLE BUILDING. FIVE AND FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND TO RENOVATE AN EXISTING FACILITY. AND ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION SO JUST TO TAKE CARE OF THE GAP IN THE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. IS ABOUT A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. SO THIS LEGISLATION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD CLOSING THAT GAP AND IT DOES TO GREAT THINGS IT MAKES MORE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO RENOVATE AND CONSTRUCT SO IT IS FOR THE INFANTS AND TODDLERS. AND EXPAND ACCESS TO THAT FUNDING TO MORE PROVIDERS BOTH ELEAZAR NANI -- ELEAZAR RUNNING FEDERAL AND OR STATE SUBSIDIZED PROGRAMS SO WE BELIEVE THE SINCE THIS WILL INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS. TO DEVELOP THE FACILITY TO SERVE THOSE CHILDREN AND HEAD START CALIFORNIA IS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DOCTOR THOMPSON THE HEAD START DIRECTOR FOR TWIN RIVERS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND WE US SERVE OUR POPULATION OF T. K. THROUGH ADULT ED. TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS A LITTLE OVER ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE INFANTS TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS -- I AM HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE GRANT FOR FACILITIES FOR ONE PRIMARY REASON AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT OF SERVING THE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FACILITIES. OF MANY OF OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE EXTRA SPACE BECAUSE THEY ARE SERVING OUR OLDER STUDENTS AND MANY OF THE FACILITIES WERE BUILT IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES WHICH MEANS THAT THEY REQUIRE SOME UPGRADES. AND RENOVATIONS TO EVEN HOUSE ANY OF OUR YOUNGER LEARNERS -- I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TOWARD NUMBERS APPLIED FOR AND RECEIVED A GRANT TO HOUSEHOLDS -- AND MAKE A PORTABLE MODULAR AND A PLAYGROUND AND IT WAS A LITTLE OVER MILLION DOLLARS TO SERVE A FORTY ADDITIONAL STUDENTS AND THE NORTH HIGHLANDS AREA -- THIS IS AGAIN ONE OF OUR STRUGGLES IS THAT WE OF COURSE WANT -- TO SUPPORT MORE STUDENTS THAT ARE OF THE YOUNGER AGE BUT WE DO NOT HAVE FACILITIES SO WOULD BE -- A BENEFIT FOR US IF WE COULD INDEED GET SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR FACILITIES SO I SAY TO YOU THAT IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME.

[inaudible] TWELVE TWENTY NINE HI MY PERSONS TESTIFYING WITH ME WHO WAS HERE. I SEE SOMEBODY [inaudible] HI. BEEN WITH THE STATE. THANK YOU. CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER. AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S HERE. A MAJORITY FOSTER YOUTH ASPIRE TO HIGHER EDUCATION HOWEVER ONLY BACHELOR DEGREE IN LESS THAN 1% WILL OBTAIN A MASTER'S OR DOCTORATE DEGREE. ISSUES OF HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS ARE PREVALENT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND MANY STUDENTS STRUGGLE WITH THE RISING COST OF BASIC NEEDS AND LIVING. MANY FOSTER YOUTH DEPEND ON FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND ADDITIONAL BENEFITS SUCH AS CAL FRESH. AND A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR THAT LEADS. TO LOW HIGHER EDUCATION ATTAINMENT FOR FOSTER YOUTH IS THE LACK OF FINANCIAL STABILITY. AND OTHER SUPPORT FOR MORE TRADITIONAL STUDENTS. THE MORE TRADITIONAL STUDENTS RECEIVE. A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS NECESSARY FOR MANY YOUTH SUCH. SUCH AS FOSTER YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND pBE SUCCESSFUL AND STAYS ECONOMY. WE SHOULD TAKE STEPS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CAL FRESH FOR FOSTER YOUTH STUDENTS. I CAN THINK OF NO MORE IMPORTANT BASIC RATE THAN ACCESS TO FOOD. WHAT DO WE DO IF WE CAN'T EAT? CAL PRECIOUS SESSION HOW FRESH PROVIDES PEOPLE WITH ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. THAT SUPPORT THEIR HEALTH WELL BEING AND SCHOOL AND WORK READINESS. MY BILL A AB TWELVE TWENTY NINE WILL ONE ESTABLISH A MEAL PROGRAM FOR FOSTER YOU TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL CAL FIRST BENEFITS. FOR FOSTER USED TO COMPANY THEIR HOUSING SUPPORT PAYMENTS. THREE ENSURE THAT THE STUDENT WHO WORKS AN UNPAID INTERNSHIP IS ABLE TO QUALIFY. AS MEETING CAL FOR STUDENT WORK HOURS. AND LASTLY REQUIRED DSS TO ISSUE PROMISING PRACTICE DREADED USED TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT FOSTER FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM CAL FOR ASH. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT FOSTER YOUTH HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. THE FOOD SECURE AND TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS HIGHER EDUCATION. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND JOURNEY HOUSE INTRODUCE OUR WITNESSES JESSE AGUILAR AND JESSICA. BARTHOLOMAY. THAT WOULDN'T PLEASE SIR A GOOD AFTERNOON A CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OF MY NAME IS JESSE I CAN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF JOURNEY HOUSE OF THE CO SPONSORS. OF A. B.. TWELVE TWENTY NINE BUT WE HAVE WORKED WITH FORMER BOSS USED FOR OUT OF THE LOS ANGELES IN. A CALIFORNIA -- FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS. PRIMARILY AS DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS WE SPENT MUCH OF OUR TIME -- HELPING FOSSE USE A CREE ACTUAL PLAN ACTION PLANS THAT WILL HELP THEM MEET THEIR HOUSING EMPLOYMENT. pAND WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON HELPING THEM ACHIEVE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHICH MENTIONED STATISTICALLY ONLY 3% THREE OR 4% OF FOUR OR FIVE TO THE CALIFORNIA. GOING TO COMPLETE A COLLEGE DEGREE. IN FACT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL SUMMER FOR SEASON THE STATE. GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. OUR STUDENTS FIND THEMSELVES HAVING TO MAKE VERY DIFFICULT LIFE DECISIONS. DETERMINING THE PRIORITIES. TOO OFTEN THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TO STAY IN SCHOOL OR KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS -- TO CONTINUE TO PAY FOR CHILDCARE. OR TO PAY OUR TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE TODAY IS FROM SUPPORT OF AB. TWELVE TWENTY NINE THIS BILL SEEKS TO ACCOMPLISH TWO PRIMARY OBJECTIVES. ONE IS TO EXPAND THE TYPE OF WORK HOURS PERMISSIBLE. TO QUALIFY FOR THE COVERAGE ELIGIBILITY. SPECIFICALLY ALLOWING NON PAID INTERNSHIPS. TO QUALIFY FOR THE TWENTY HOUR WORK REQUIREMENT OF CAO FRESH. THIS PROVIDES STUDENTS OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD WORK EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD THAT ALIGNS WITH THEIR ACADEMIC. AND CAREER GOALS INCREASING THEIR CHANCES OF SELF SUFFICIENCY. WE'VE WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY OF OUR STUDENTS FROM AROUND THE STATE. THAT WHILE WORKING MEANING FOR INTERNSHIPS AND JOBS. DEFINING THEMSELVES UNABLE TO RECEIVE CONFERENCE. GIVEN THE NARROW DEFINITION OF WHAT MEETS THE TWENTY HOUR WORK REQUIREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE. ONE STUDENT IS WORKING -- INTERNET FOR UNDERGRAD. AT UCLA. AND WANTS TO WORK IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. SO SHE THOUGHT OUT AND IS WORKING AN UNPAID INTERNSHIP AT A HOSPITAL. BUT THIS IS OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAM QUALIFICATIONS. AND THEREFORE SHE'S UNABLE TO RECEIVE THE NEED COVERAGE FOOD SUPPORT. THIS BILL ALSO SEEKS TO PROVIDE FOOD RESOURCES FOSTER YOU CURRENTLY RECEIVING A HOUSING STIPEND THAT EXTENDED FOSTER CARE ALSO KNOWN AS THE TWELFTH. WHILE THESE MAY NOT APPLY TO THOSE YOUTH WAS TYPING THIS PAID AS RENT. TO THE BUILDING OWNER OR HOUSING PROVIDED DIRECTLY. MANY FOSTER THE RECEIVING A BIT OF HOUSING SUPPORT DIRECTLY. ARE INELIGIBLE FOR CALPERS. BECAUSE OUR HOUSING STIPEND IS PAID TO THEM DIRECTLY -- IN -- AND THEN THE USE THAT MONEY TO PAY FOR THEIR TO THEIR HOW TO PAY FOR THEIR HOUSING. THIS IS THEREFORE COUNTED AS PART OF THEIR INCOME. WHICH PUTS THEM OVER THE INCOME LIMIT FOR CONFERENCE. THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROVIDE THESE RESOURCES TO YOUTH WITH COVERAGE FOOD SUPPORT. UTILIZING THE CURRENT A. B. TWELVE STEP IN PROCESS. ALLOCATING FUNDS FOR FOSTER YOUTH TO COVER FOOD EXPENSES. FORMER FOSSEY'S SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS ARE CRUCIAL PURSUING THEIR ACADEMIC AND CAREER GOALS. IT IS THE ONLY SUPPORT THEY CAN RELY ON SINCE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY. OF FAMILY FOUNDATION. BY MAKING THESE CRUCIAL INVESTMENTS THE STATE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE ITS COMMITMENT. AS A LEADER IN THE SOCIAL WORK. THE LIGHTS FOSTER YOUTH. IT IS FOR THE REASON THAT WE ARE JUST A PART. OF AB. TWELVE TWENTY NINE THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST ABOUT THE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WERE PROUD TO COSPONSOR THIS BILL. I WOULD JUST A BRIEF STATEMENT THAT -- IT'S ALWAYS SO FRUSTRATING AS AN ANTI HUNGER ADVOCATE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EVERYBODY AGREES THAT. THE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND THE TRANSITION AGE FOSTER YOUTH SHOULDN'T GO HUNGRY AND THAT BEING HUNGRY DOESN'T HELP THEM ACHIEVE THEIR ACADEMIC PROFESSIONAL OR LIFE OR HEALTH GOALS. AND IT MAKES US LOOK BAD AS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN. AND YET THE POLICY OF BARRIERS -- TO THIS POPULATION RECEIVING CALPERS ARE SO. DIRE -- AND WE JUST REALLY APPRECIATE ARE ARE CO SPONSORS COMING TO US AND SAYING. WE UNDERSTAND THESE LOOK INTRACTABLE BUT WHAT CAN WE DO AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR SAYING. THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S STAFF AND THE CHAIRMAN WOMAN FOR HELPING US MAKE THE BILL BETTER TO GET THERE.

WHATEVER -- MY SHARE WAS IF IT RAN OUT I COULDN'T GO AND DRINK COFFEE AND IS DIFFICULT EVEN FOR FAMILY ON CAL FOR ASH TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND SO TO LOOK OUT OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITY WHICH IS OUR FOSTER YOU -- I'LL SAY THIS AND CLOSE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO GO -- TO IRON WOOD PRISON -- MEN'S PRISON. AND EVERY MALE THAT I SPOKE. TO THEY WERE IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM.

AS WE EXPAND OUR INVESTMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO TRULY HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS. THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO SUPPORT THEIR BRAINDEVELOPMENT SOCIAL SKILLS AND KATE KINDERGARTEN READINESS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT START EARLIER IN A CHILD'S LIFE MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. WE NEED TO HOLD OURSELVES TO A HIGH STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING SURE CHILDREN WHO FACE THE BIGGEST BARRIERS.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHRISTINA CRAWLEY AND I AM SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMS FOR ZERO TO THREE IN CALIFORNIA. ZERO TO THREE IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WHOSE MISSION IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL BABIES AND TODDLERS HAVE A STRONG START IN LIFE. IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THAT WE OPENED AN OFFICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TODAY AS A CO SPONSOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SIXTY SEVEN INCREASING ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CHILD CARE FOR VULNERABLE INFANTS AND TODDLERS. IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM LEAVES TOO MANY LOW INCOME BABIES AND TODDLERS BEHIND. IT'S JUST 9% OF CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME INFANTS AND TODDLERS THAT ARE ENROLLED IN SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE. EVEN FEWER FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO THE HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS WITH THAT HAVE THE GREATEST POSITIVE INCOME IMPACT. ON LOW INCOME BABIES. CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE DEPENDS ON QUALITY AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE. QUALITY CHILD CARE FEET THE BABY'S GROWING BRAIN. BUILDING THE FOUNDATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENTS AND LEARNING NECESSARY FOR THEM TO THRIVE AS ADULTS. IT'S THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF LIFE THAT ARE SO CRITICAL. THIS IS WHEN THE BRAIN CONNECTIONS ARE FORMING AT A RATE OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION PER SECOND. POSITIVE INTERACTIONS WITH NURTURING CARE GIVERS. REINFORCE THESE CONNECTIONS CREATING A STRONG FOUNDATION. QUALITY CHILDCARE PREPARES BABIES FOR FUTURE LEARNING AND SUCCESS. IT'S IN THESE HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS THAT CHILDREN HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE ENHANCED VOCABULARY. HAVE MORE SOPHISTICATED ATTENTION AND MEMORY SKILLS AND GET ALONG BETTER WITH THEIR PEERS. HOW THE SINGLE MOM OF TWO DAUGHTERS I KNOW FIRST HAND? HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE QUALITY CHILDCARE? MY DAUGHTERS WERE RECIPIENTS OF HIGH QUALITY SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE THAT PROVIDED ME THE OPPORTUNITY. TO FINISH COLLEGE AND GO TO WORK. BECAUSE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE I HAVE RAISE TWO AMAZING YOUNG ADULTS. WHO WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES? MANY MANY MORE FAMILIES WHO NEED IT DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT THEIR BABIES AND TODDLERS HAVE A STRONG START IN LIFE. AB ONE SIXTY SEVEN WILL HELP CLOSE THE EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITY GAP. BY STRENGTHENING AND EXPANDING CHILD CARE PROGRAMS FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE. EARLY HEAD START MODEL.

THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE RIGHT YES HI RES I AM MATHIS BERMAN [inaudible] CHOI. FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I GIPSON [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN STONE. TWO ZERO WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THAT ONE ITEM NUMBER [inaudible] FIVE EIGHTY THREE NINETY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TO THEIR IN PRESENTING AB THREE NINETY FIVE THE FOSTER YOUTH SAFETY ACT WHICH WILL STRENGTHENING INVESTIGATIONS OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT. OF CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. AB THREE NINETY FIVE WILL CREATE TIMELINES BY WHEN CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS MUST BE COMPLETED WHEN CONDUCTING THESE INVESTIGATIONS. THIS BILL COMES AS A RESULT OF AN AUDIT CONDUCTED BY THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT DISCOVERED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WAS NOT ALWAYS. PROPERLY RECORDING INVESTIGATING AND RESOLVING CASES OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT. IN FACT THIS REPORT NOTED THAT IN SOME COMPLAINTS CASES APPROXIMATELY. OF IN THAT IN SOME COMPLAINTS CASES TOOK APPROXIMATELY TWO TO FIFTEEN MONTHS. I IN WHICH THERE WAS NO ACTIVITY NOTED IN. TO INDICATE THAT THE COMPLAINTS WERE BEING ACTIVELY INVESTIGATED THAT'S TOO LONG. IN FACT THIS REPORT NOTED THAT IN SOME. A COMPLAINT CASES APPROX I'M SORRY. MOVE ON IN ADDITION THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS COMPLAINTS INVOLVING SEXUAL AND PHYSICAL ABUSE TOOK AN AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. TO BE COMPLETED AND WE'RE NOT ALWAYS PROPERLY CROSS REPORTED. THESE OUR FINDINGS THAT I DO NOT TAKE LIGHTLY AND I KNOW THAT NONE OF US HERE DO. WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO THESE CHILDREN WHO HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCE UNTHINKABLE HARDSHIPS BY BEING RIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES. ALLOWING CHILDREN TO REMAIN IN POTENTIALLY UNSAFE CONDITIONS WHILE UNDER THE STATE'S CARE IS SIMPLY WRONG. BY ESTABLISHING THESE CRITICAL STANDARDS AND PROTOCOLS BY WHICH THE COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING DIVISION AND LOCAL INVESTIGATORS MUST ABIDE BY WHEN CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT. I AM GLAD IN OUT OF HOME CARE WE ARE PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM EXPERIENCING FURTHER HARM AND TRAUMA AT THE HANDS OF THOSE ENTRUSTED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. HERE WITH ME TODAY ARE MEMBERS FROM TO CO SPONSOR TO CO SPONSORS OF AB THREE NINETY FIVE WHO CAN FURTHER ELABORATE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL. SARAH PORTER FOUNDER AND CEO OF PHENOMENAL PHENOMENAL PHENOMENAL FAMILIES AND TRAUMA INFORMED SYSTEM SPECIALISTS. WITH BUT CHADWICK CENTER JULIE MCCORMICK POLICY ASSOCIATE OF THE CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER AND I DON'T HAVE THE NAME OF THE THIRD PERSON. ALL RIGHT YOUR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON RAY AS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEECH TODAY MY NAME IS SERRA POTTER AND I AM THE FOUNDER AND CEO PHENOMENAL FAMILIES. A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BASED OUT OF SAN DIEGO THAT SERVES PREGNANT AND PARENTING YOU COULD EXPERIENCE FOSTER CARE. I AM ALSO A NATIONAL EXPERT ON TRAUMA INFORMED TROUBLE FOR SYSTEMS AND A LOAN NOT A FOSTER CARE IN THE VERY SAME SYSTEM THAT I NOW WORK AND I AM HERE TODAY TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF TIMELY AND QUALITY INVESTIGATIONS OF MALTREATMENT OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN CARE. THIS PAST SUMMER I WAS ASKED BY THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO SERVE ON A SPECIAL WORKING GROUP. TO EXAMINE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES FOLLOWING SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE CASES. OF TWO TWIN BROTHERS TO BEEN SEXUALLY CHRONICALLY OR CRITICALLY SEXUALLY ABUSED BY THEIR FOSTER FATHER. DESPITE THE BROTHERS REPEATEDLY DISCLOSING THE ABUSE TO THEIR SOCIAL WORKER AND MORE THAN A DOZEN REPORTS TO THE AGENCY BY OTHER ADULTS ON THE CHILDREN'S LIVES THEIR CLAIMS WERE NEVER ADEQUATELY INVESTIGATED AND THE BOYS ARE MADE IN THE HOME AT THE MERCY OF THEIR ABUSER. WHAT HAPPENED TO THESE TWO TWIN BOYS RESONATE WITH ME ON A PERSONAL LEVEL? JUST TEN YEARS PRIOR AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN MY OWN BROTHER WAS VIOLENTLY SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IN A GROUP HOME. HIS DISCLOSURE TO GROUP HOME STOP WAS WHAT WAS ABOUT WITH GOT UP WITH WAS MET WITH SKEPTICISM AND WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS AN ATTITUDE THAT THE ASSAULT WAS SOMEHOW WANTED OR WARRANTED BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN LABELED A DIFFICULT CHILD. HE HAD TO RECOUNT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM OVER A DOZEN TIMES TO COMPLETE STRANGERS HOPING SOMEONE WOULD BELIEVE HIM. INSTEAD OF BEING MATT WITH COMPASSION AND TREATED LIKE A VICTIM OF A VIOLENT ASSAULT HE WAS SENT BACK TO THE SAME GROUP HOME. TO FACE THE SHAME AND HUMILIATION OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM WHAT THE VARIOUS AGENCIES WORKED ON THEIR INVESTIGATIONS. FOLLOWING MY BROTHER'S ASSAULT WE WERE TOLD THAT CHILD WELFARE WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO ENSURE THAT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. YET HERE I AM YEARS LATER. WITH MORE EXAMPLES OF HOW INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY FAILED CHILDREN IN OUR CARE PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVING YOUTH CLUB AND LABEL DIFFICULT. WHO HAVE BEEN QUOTE UNQUOTE HAVE A QUOTE UNQUOTE CREDIBILITY ISSUES OR WHO MAY HAVE BEEN SEEN AS TRYING TO GET BACK AT THEIR FOSTER PARENTS BROTHER SOCIAL WORKER? THE TRAUMA THAT WE EXPERIENCE AND FOSTER CARE IS A BURDEN THAT WE CARRY WITH US FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES. WE CAN EASE THAT BURDEN BY ENSURING THAT NO CHILD HAS TO PROVE THE HARM THAT THEY HAD BEEN SUBJECTED. TO INSTEAD WE CAN UTILIZE TRAINED INTERVIEWERS AT THE CHILD ADVOCACY ADVOCACY CENTERS. AND TIMELY WELL COORDINATED INVESTIGATIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO KEEP CHILDREN SAFE AND BEGIN THE HEALING PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITH SCREENS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JULIE MCCORMICK POLICY ASSOCIATE AT THE CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER CALIFORNIA WE ARE A NONPROFIT LAW FIRM THAT REPRESENTS OVER THIRTY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN. AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE IN LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER COUNTIES. I'M HERE TODAY AS A SPONSOR OF AB THREE NINETY FIVE WHICH WILL ENSURE AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE WHEN THERE IS AN ALLEGATION THAT A CHILD IN FOSTER CARE. HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT. IN OUR PRACTICE WE SEE FAR TOO MANY OF OUR CHILD CLIENTS SUFFERING FROM ABUSE AND NEGLECT IN THE VERY HOMES INTENDED TO PROTECT THEM FROM ABUSIVE FAMILIES. AND UNFORTUNATELY FAR TOO OFTEN ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT ARE NOT RESPONDED TO APPROPRIATELY BY THE VERY SYSTEM INTENDED TO PROTECT THESE CHILDREN. THEIR FAILURES TO REPORT ALLEGATIONS FAILURES TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS AND FAILURES TO PROTECT CHILDREN EVEN AFTER SUBSTANTIATING ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT. FOR EXAMPLE STILL SEE REPRESENTED A YOUNG GIRL WHO FOR MANY YEARS WAS A VICTIM OF SEXUAL AND PHYSICAL ABUSE BY HER FOSTER FATHER. SHE DISCLOSE THIS ABUSE TO A TEACHER WHO APPROPRIATE REPORTED THE ALLEGATION TO THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY. HOWEVER THIS INITIAL REPORT WAS NOT CROSS REPORTED TO LICENSING AN INVESTIGATION DID NOT IN SU. AFTER A SECOND REPORT WAS MADE A LICENSING INVESTIGATION DID BEGAN BUT IT CONTINUED FOR YEARS. OUR CLIENTS OWN ATTORNEY WAS NOT AWARE OF THE ALLEGATION NOR WAS SHE MADE AWARE OF THE PENDING INVESTIGATION UNTIL IT WAS REVEALED DURING A TRIAL ON AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ISSUE. THE CHILD WAS REMOVED FROM THE HOME BY A COURT ORDER. SADLY AS YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THE OTHER WITNESS THIS SAME SITUATION. THIS IS WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS SO CRUCIAL. EIGHTY THREE NINETY FIVE IS INTENDED TO RESOLVE THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS AND HELP PROTECT THE CHILDREN YOUTH OUR STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP SAFE. IT DOES SOBRE REQUIRING THAT AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR CONDUCTING QUERY INTO A REVIEW SOME OF INTO REPORT OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT. THEREBY REDUCING THE POSSIBILITY THAT REPORTS FROM A TRAUMATIZED CHILD WILL BE DISMISSED. AND ALLOW THE INVESTIGATION OF FOCUS MORE ON OBSERVABLE FACTS THAN ON PAST IMPRESSIONS. YOU WERE A CRIER THE COSTA CROSS REPORTING OF ALLEGATIONS BETWEEN LICENSING AGENCIES AND THE CHILD WHAT. CHILD WELFARE AGENCY REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT CHILD LIVES IN. AND FINALLY PUTTING INTO PLACE CLEAR GUIDELINES ABOUT LICENSING INVESTIGATIONS ONE SURE EVERY ALLEGATION OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT IS RESPONDED TO AND INVESTIGATED APPROPRIATELY. CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM ARE UNDER THE CARE AND CUSTODY OF THE STATE. IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY SHIELD THEM FROM FURTHER ABUSE AND TRAUMA AND THE LAW MUST MANDATE A SENSIBLE COMMONSENSE APPROACH TO COLLECTING INFORMATION ON ALLEGATIONS. OF MALTREATMENT BY THOSE ENTRUSTED TO THE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN. CLC IS PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS LEGISLATION AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. LET'S.

AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR ALL EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THIS GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE CAME AS A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE SPEAKERS OF BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THIS COMMISSION WORKED DILIGENTLY FOR TWO YEARS AT ASSESSING ALL ASPECTS. OF THE VERY COMPLEX EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION STRUCTURE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THERE AFTER PREPARED A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. WITH A LONG ARRAY OF PLANS TO EXPAND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FROM CHILD CARE TO PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS WITH PROPOSALS BY EVERYONE FROM THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. THE GOVERNOR. THE MULTITUDE OF LEGISLATORS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ELEVATE EXISTING GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE COMING INFLUX OF PROGRAM EXPANSION. THIS NEW BRANCH WILL HELP SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IT'S SUCCEEDING WELL THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. CONTINUE STRUCTURES FOR RAPIDLY EXPANDING AREAS OF EDUCATION RATHER THAN REACTIVE CAN INSURE THAT THE PLANS SET FORTH BY THE GOVERNOR. THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AND OUR COLLEAGUES ARE SUCCESSFULLY ADMINISTERED FROM THE START. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS THE GREATEST EQUALIZER. AND THE CALIFORNIA IT SHOULD PROVIDE FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WILL ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE THESE SO SICK SO CHAU. SOCIO ECONOMICALLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAMS IN A COORDINATED AND EFFICIENT MANNER. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON DONIS NARINDER WITH THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER -- OUR PRESIDENT CEO WAS INVOLVED IN THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AND WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE A POSITION BUT WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT -- MAGNENTIUS PARENT VOICES A FELLOW BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AND WE SUPPORT.

I'LL SECOND THAT -- ANYONE WHO WISHES IT TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TO PRESENT AB ONE NINETY FOUR I AM PROUD TO FIGHT FOR ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. TO BE UTILIZED TO FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE SLOTS AS PART OF AB. ONE NINETY FOUR WELL ESTABLISHED RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. YOUNG CHILDREN WITH THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND COGNITIVE COGNITIVE SKILLS THEY NEED TO BE READY TO ENTER KINDERGARTEN AND HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE. FURTHERMORE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMMING PARTICULARLY CHILD CARE PROGRAMS PROVIDING THE NECESSARY SUPPORT. TO OUR STATES WORKING FAMILIES. HOWEVER FOR MANY FAMILIES FOR MANY WORKING FAMILIES CHILD CARE IS INACCESSIBLE DIFFICULT TO FIND OR SIMPLY TOO EXPENSIVE. CALIFORNIA FACES A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF CHILD CARE LOW INCOME. WORKING FAMILIES ARE IMPACTED BY THIS SHORTAGE THE MOST. RECENT DATA INDICATES AT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR STATE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE. BUT DO NOT RECEIVE IT DUE TO THE LACK OF ACCESS IN THE STATE. THAT MEANS EIGHT OUT OF NINE CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CARE ARE NOT RECEIVING IT. WELL I COMMEND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. WHICH PROVIDES PLENTY OF INVESTMENTS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMS. CHILD CARE SUBSIDIES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE EXISTING PROPOSAL. EVEN CHILD CARE OUT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION INVESTMENT AND EXPANSION WILL MEAN THAT THE LOWEST INCOME WORKING FAMILIES WILL STILL NOT BENEFIT FROM EXISTING AND PROPOSED STATE INVESTMENTS IN THIS AREA. THAT'S WHY I STRONGLY URGE THE COMMITTEE. TO PROVE AB. ONE NINETY FOUR WITH ME TODAY TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER FROM SAN BERNARDINO. IS JAMES MOST AS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER ADDITIONALLY I'D LIKE TO ALSO WELCOME MERRY IGNATIUS A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. MEMBER AND REPRESENTATIVE OF PARENTS VOICES.

AND WE ALL IN ADDITION TO MANY THINGS WE OPERATED ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD -- BE A RECIPIENT OF THIS FUNDING TO BENEFIT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SO AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED -- YOU KNOW ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE BUT NOT RECEIVING SERVICES ONLY ONE IN NINE CHILDREN ACROSS THE STATE ARE RECEIVING CHURCH -- SERVICES IN ONLY ONE ELEVEN INFANTS AND TODDLERS RECEIVE SERVICES IN SEMINOLE COUNTY OUR NEEDS MUCH GREATER WE HAVE -- NEARLY 30% OF ALL OF OUR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY IN IN SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT NUMBER RISES 240% OF FAMILIES LIVING IN CHURCH -- POVERTY. FURTHERMORE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DIDN'T PROVIDE ANY FUNDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO FOR ADDITIONAL SPACES SO THAT'S A CONCERN OF THIS IS FOR US AS WELL THIS BILL WILL -- PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES FOR ADDITIONAL CHILDREN THAT ARE THAT ARE SO WE NEED -- ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM THE MONEY GOING TO GENERAL CHILD CARE IN ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS THESE ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE PROGRAMS FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN INFANTS. ZERO TO THREE TO PROVIDE IN FIND -- INFANT AND TODDLER CHILD CARE WHICH IS NOT ONLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE CHILD CARE TO FIND BUT IT'S ALSO THE HARDEST CHILD CARE TO FIND. SO WE REALLY ARE HOPING THAT YOU WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BILL -- CONSIDER WITH AN AYE VOTE THIS IS AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUE AND WE'VE HEARD LOTS OF THERE'S LOTS OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF EARLY LEARNING EXPERIENCES. BOTH THE IMMEDIATE RETURN IN THE LONG TERM A RETURN ON INVESTMENT SO WE REALLY ASK YOU TO CONSIDER -- THE BENEFIT THAT THIS WILL MAKE AS A STARTING POINT TO HELP FAMILIES ACHIEVE SELF SUFFICIENCY IN BEGIN -- ALIVE TOWARD PROSPERITY SUING COURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS THANK YOU. FOR GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MERRY EGNATIUS I'M THE STATE RIGHT ORGANIZER FOR PARENT VOICES -- WE JUST TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN IS INTRINSICALLY LINKED TO THE WELL BEING OF THEIR PARENTS-- FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS NOW WE'VE BEEN BRINGING MOTHERS WHO ARE ON THE WAITING LIST TO THE CAPITAL TO SHARE THEIR STORIES THEY POUR THEIR HEART OUT THEY DESCRIBE THE CHALLENGES OF THE SACRIFICES. AND YET YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR ON THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THIS PROGRAM. I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR REALLY SHEDDING A LIGHT ON THIS CRISIS IN USING HER PLATFORM. TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE STORIES TO LIFE. THE BEAUTY OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY WHAT PARENTS WANT AND NEED. THIS BILL TAKES US AWAY OFTENTIMES IN THIS BUILDING WE ARE TARGET POLICIES TOWARDS AGE GROUP OR WE TARGET POLICIES BY SAUDI. AND THAT'S NOT HOW FAMILIES OPERATE -- WE NEED CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN FROM BIRTH ONWARDS -- WE CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH CHILD GETS CARE ON BECAUSE WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE TO BE THE ONE THAT STAYS HOME WITH THE OTHER ONE RIGHT WE WE THE WHOLE FAMILY. NEEDS TO PROGRESS FORWARD AND THE OTHER TRUTH IS THAT FAMILIES USE ALL TYPE OF SETTINGS AT ALL DIFFERENT POINTS IN THEIR CHILD'S LIFE I'VE USED FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR CARE FAMILY CHILDCARE CENTER BASED CARE. AND WAS BASED ON MY CHILD'S NEEDS AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT AND SO WE DON'T NEED A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AND AND THIS BILL REALLY ALLOWS FAMILIES TO MAKE CHOICES. THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THEIR SCHEDULE THEY DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER A LOT OF THINGS IN LIFE. FLEXIBLE CHILDCARE OPTIONS GIVE THEM THAT ONE SENSE OF CONTROL TO CHOOSE WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THEM AND THAT'S WHY THEY NEED THAT FLEXIBILITY -- YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT IN HEALTHCARE WE DON'T -- PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO JUST BABIES FOR PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO JUST FOUR YEAR OLDS OR HEALTH CARE TO JUST SCHOOL AGE KIDS WE PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO THE WHOLE FAMILY. AND WE NEED TO APPLY THAT SAME THING -- TO CHILDCARE WE ALSO BELIEVE THIS IS A RACIAL GENDER AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE BILL 86% OF THE CHILDREN WHO ARE WAITING FOR CHILD CARE OUR CHILDREN OF COLOR. THEY WERE BLACK MOMS AND OPENED LAST NIGHT SLEEPING IN CARS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET TO WORK THEY CAN'T PAY FOR CHILDCARE AND THERE THEY ARE HOMELESS AND SO WE WE REALLY NEED. TO UNDERSTAND AN UNDERSCORE HOW THESE HOW THIS BILL REALLY ADDRESSES -- INEQUITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WANT TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON LEE BYNUM ASK ME -- THIRTY AND THIRTY TWO W. IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE WORK ON THIS BILL. I DO ACCEPT [inaudible] AMENDMENTS. WE WANT TO EXPAND TRAINING FOR OUR FOSTER YOUTH RESOURCE FAMILIES TO INCLUDE INFORMATION ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND LABOR TRAFFICKING IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR FOSTER FAMILIES ARE AWARE OF THIS SO THAT THEY CAN SEE THE SIGNS AND PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR FOSTER USE. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION WITH ME TODAY. I HAVE. TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL JOSEPHINE THEME STIR THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE MANAGER AT WE'VE AND JULIE MCCORMICK WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE FELLOW. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU TEACHER AND ASSEMBLY. MEMBER RAY IS -- FOR AUTHORING AB.-EIGHT SIXTY FIVE I AM JOSEPHINE FILM STIR. AND I AM A SURVIVOR OF EXPLOITATION AS WELL AS A NATIONAL. SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT -- I AM ALSO. A CASE MANAGER FOR A LOCAL RAPE CRISIS CENTER HERE LOCALLY. WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT -- SURVIVORS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WE ALSO PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN RESPONSE IN OUTREACH SERVICES. TO VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING. I AM HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. EIGHT SIXTY FIVE AS AN ADVOCATE I HAVE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH FOSTER CARE YOUTH WHO WERE TRAFFICKED. THESE YOUTH ARE OFTEN VULNERABLE TO TRAFFICKING JUST AS A RESULT OF BEING IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. YOU'VE THE HAVE EXPERIENCED ABUSE AND NEGLECT ARE OFTEN SEARCHING FOR LOVE AND ACCEPTANCE IN AND CAN FIND THEMSELVES IN SCARY AND SOMETIMES DEADLY SITUATIONS. SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY. I HAVE SEEN YOUTH PLACE WITH FOSTER PARENTS ALTHOUGH DOING THEIR BEST. HAD NO IDEA ABOUT TRAFFICKING IN THE WAYS TO SUPPORT. TRAFFIC OR AT RISK YOUTH. THIS RESULTED IN MANY FOSTER YOUTH LEAVING THEIR HOMES AND RETURNING TO THEIR TRAFFICKERS. HOWEVER THIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF THESE FOSTER FAMILIES. WE'RE TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE TRAFFICKING DYNAMICS AND VULNERABILITIES AND PROVIDED THE TOOLS TO ASSIST THESE CHILDREN IN TURNING. IN TURN PROVIDING THEM WITH THE SAFE PLACE TO RECOVER THRIVE IN HE'LL. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL FOSTER FAMILIES WE PROPERLY TRAINED WHEN PROVIDING CARE TO FOSTER YOUTH. WITH AB EIGHT SIXTY FIVE IMPLEMENTATION FOSTER FAMILIES WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO IDENTIFY THE SIGNS. OF TRAFFICKING AND THE RECRUITMENT TACTICS WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY PREVENT A CHILD FROM BEING TRAFFICKED IN THE FIRST PLACE. AB EIGHT SIX FIVE WOULD GIVE RESOURCE FAMILIES THE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO KEEP CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN SAFE FROM HARMFUL TRAUMA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHAT ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LIKE? TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. ONE OTHER WITNESSES SO THERE'S ANOTHER WITNESS. I'M SORRY. SHOULD BE BRIEF I'LL BE BRIEF -- GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR RAZ FOR AUTHORING AB. EIGHT SIX FIVE I'M JULIE MCCORMICK ITS STATE FELL A FELLOW OF THE WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE I'M HERE TODAY AS A SPONSOR OF AV -- EIGHT SIX FIVE I BELIEVE OUR OTHER WITNESS JOSEPHINE TEAMSTER OUT REALLY COVERED EVERYTHING BUT JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE THINGS -- FOSTER CARE FAMILIES ARE ON THE FRONTLINE INNER MONOMERS CRITICAL PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE IN A POSITION TO IDENTIFY AND EXPLOIT A YOUNG PERSON EARLY ON AND GET THEM THE HELP THEY NEED -- AS OF TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES RESOURCE FAMILIES TO BE TRAINED HOWEVER AB EIGHT SIX FIVE WILL ADDRESS A GAP IN TRAINING AND THAT THE ISSUE OF TRAFFIC AND MORE SPECIFICALLY COMMERCIAL AND SEXUALLY EXPLOITED. CHILDREN -- THAT TRAINING IS CURRENTLY OPTIONAL SO WHEN EXPLOITED CHILDREN ARE PLACED IN HOMES OF THE FOSTER PARENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THEIR NEEDS AND THE TRAUMA AND IS FOCUSED ON THEIR SAFETY. THE RESULTS IN THE CHILD BE MORE RECEPTIVE TO SERVICES AND INCREASES THE CHANCE THEY WILL AVOID FURTHER EXPLOITATION. I'M FOR THESE REASONS AND FOR WHAT JOSEPHINE IS ALREADY TOLD US THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE IS PROUD TO SPONSOR AB EIGHT SIX FIVE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE I ABOUT.

ONE TWENTY FIVE HE WILL BE HERE SHORTLY IS THERE A WITNESS HERE -- MISTER MCCARTY SPILL. YES. MR BURKE MISTER BERMAN WILL PRESENT TIME. OKAY. TEN ROOMS CONVERSAR EVEN BETTER [inaudible] ON THE MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT AB ONE TWENTY FIVE ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUE THE SOMETHING OVER MCCARTY AB ONE TWENTY FIVE ESTABLISHES A SINGLE REGIONALI STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM FOR CHILDCARE PRESCHOOL. AND EARLY LEARNING SERVICES CURRENTLY OUR RATE POLICIES BIFURCATED BETWEEN TWO SYSTEMS REGIONAL MARKET RATE WHICH PAY CERTAIN PROVIDERS BASED ON A PERCENTILE OF THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE IN THAT REGION. IN STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE WHICH PAYS PROVIDERS AN ARBITRARY AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR CHILD AND IS LOWER THAN THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE. IN THE LAST FOUR BUDGET YEARS THE STATE IS INCREASED LOTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM GENERAL CHILD CARE IN ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM. AS A WAY TO ATTEMPT TO KEEP UP WITH THE RISING COST OF DOING BUSINESS IS AN EARLY LEARNING PROVIDER THE STATE IS INCREASE THE ARMAR FOUR TIMES SINCE. TWENTY FIFTEEN DEMONSTRATING THAT WE ARE NOT DOING NEARLY ENOUGH TO PAY OUR PROVIDERS ADEQUATELY IN ORDER TO MAKE THE SLOTS VIABLE THE STATE HAS TO PAY PROVIDERS AND TEACHERS BETTER. CHILDCARE PROVIDERS AND EARLY LEARNING TEACHERS ARE CONSISTENTLY AND WOEFULLY UNDERPAID AND AB ONE TWENTY FIVE WILL FIX THAT THROUGH A SINGLE REGIONAL AS REIMBURSEMENT RATES SYSTEM WITH ME TODAY IS DONNA SNEER INJURE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. AND ERIN GABLE AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR EXTERNAL IN GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS OFFICE FOR FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. AND WOULD ESPECIALLY LIKE THIS THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY STAFF FOR THE PHENOMENAL TALKING POINTS. IF AND THEY DID SUCH A GOOD JOB COVERING AND A GOOD FOR WHAT IT IS LIKE. I MY NAME'S DONNA SNARE INJURE AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER AND I WAS ALSO PROUD TO CO CHAIR. AN EIGHTEEN MONTH LONG STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT PUT TOGETHER THE TOP OF THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. I'M I THINK THAT IN THE TALKING POINTS TO COVER THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A BIFURCATED SYSTEM THAT COMES OUT OF THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS NEARLY A HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY. OF PROVIDING CHILD CARE AND OUT OF THAT WE HAVE HAD FITS AND STARTS OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO UNIFY. AND WE SEE THIS BILL AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING A COMPLEX SYSTEM TOGETHER INTO A SINGLE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE. THAT PROVIDES THE COMPENSATION SYSTEM THAT'S BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROVIDER. AND BUILDS MORE UNITY AMONGST THE SYSTEM IT'S TRANSPARENT IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE FOR ALL OF YOU WHEN YOU INVEST IN THE IN THE PROGRAM. AND I'M GONNA LET AARON GABLE TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSAL AND WE'RE DOING OUR CONDENSED VERSION. WE APPRECIATE THAT. HEARING GAVE ON THE HOT THE FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA YOUR STATE COMMISSION EARLY CHILDHOOD AND I WE JUST WANT TO EXPRESS HOW EXCITED WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN AB ONE TWENTY FIVE WHICH PROPOSES THIS SINGLE REGIONALI STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM FOR CHILD CARE. PRESCHOOL AND ALL EARLY LEARNING SERVICES THAT ONE COMPENSATES ALL TEACHERS AND PROVIDERS FOR THE TRUE COST OF PROVIDING CARE. NUMBER TWO RECOGNIZES THE COSTS FOR MEETING EXISTING BUT VARYING QUALITY STANDARDS INTENDED TO DRIVE CHILD OUTCOMES OF THIS LARGE INVESTMENT WE HAVE IN OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM. AND THREE STABILIZES THE ABILITY OF OUR STATES MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM TO PROVIDE QUALITY EARLY LEARNING OPTIONS WE CALL IT THE CHILD CARE STABILIZATION FORMULA. YOU HAVE THREE GRAPHICS IN FRONT OF YOU THAT ARE INTENDED TO VERY QUICKLY AND GRAPHICALLY EXPLAINED VERY COMPLICATED -- PROPOSAL THE OF A WONDERFUL COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON THIS SINGLE REGIONALI STATE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM FOR EARLY CARE WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT THE EARLY THE MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM IS MAINTAINED -- AND INCLUDING ITS VARIOUS PROGRAM MISSIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN -- CAN YOU. DID YOU TO ACHIEVE THE VARIOUS PROGRAM MISSIONS WE HAVE THAT NEED TO BE FUNDED ADEQUATELY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THEIR MISSIONS AND THEIR SHARED MISSION. OF SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES AND THRIVING CHILDREN. I MEAN SIGNIFICANTLY WE BELIEVE THAT LIKE WITH OUR OB LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THAT WE HAVE FOR OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM WE CAN HAVE A FORMULA FOR CHILD CARE FUNDING THAT IS A DRIVER FOR THE CHILD AND THE SYSTEM OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT TO RATHER THAN THIS KIND BIFURCATED. MESS THAT WE HAVE SO THE FIRST GRAPHIC SHOWS YOU THE BIFURCATED SYSTEM. THE SECOND GRAPHIC IS A DEPICTION OF THE CONCEPT WHICH IS QUITE SIMPLY. TAKING A REVISED REGIONAL MARKET RATE SYSTEM IN TRYING TO CORRECT SOME THE MARKET FAILURES THEY'RE BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM. AND THEN ADDING ON TO IT -- EIGHT QUALITY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ASKED TO MEET HIGHER STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS -- MOST LARGELY IN TERMS OF DRIVING THEIR COSTS IS THE CHANGE IN THE CHILD ADULT RATIO. SO -- WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ALSO -- CREATING A THE ABILITY -- FOR INCENTIVES FOR TELL TWENTY TWO PROGRAMS TO ALSO MEET TITLE FIVE STANDARDS IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO WE WILL SEE THAT THE BILL ALSO CONTAINS A PILOT. FOR THAT RECOMMENDATION. SO THE THIRD GRAPHIC YOU HAVE THEN EXPLAINS IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN OF OUR PROPOSAL. RATHER THAN TO EXPECT THE STATE TO ABSORB ALL THE COSTS OF THIS ALIGNMENT IN ONE YEAR LIKE WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IT'S A METHODOLOGYFOR HAVING THE STATE CREEK TARGETS FOR REACHING THIS NEW SINGLE RATE SYSTEM. AND THEN OVER TIME IN EACH BUDGET ACT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR WILL BE ABLE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THESE NEW TARGETS. SO -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A VERY PRUDENT BUT CRUCIAL CHANGE THE DRIVER IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OUR FUNDING. AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. HAVE A QUESTION ON YOUR LAST CHART. YES THIS IS THE AMOUNT THE COUNTY WOULD HAVE TO PAY. NO THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT THE STATE WOULD PAY TO THE TO THE CONTRACTORS HER PROVIDING CHILD CARE SERVICES. SO SAN FRANCISCO WOULD RECEIVE. ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SAN BERNADINE -- ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE COSTS OF THE MARKET SO WHAT THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED ON IS USING THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE SURVEY WHICH IS CONDUCTED. EVERY TWO YEARS. AND IT ASSESSES THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN ANY GIVEN AREA. SO YOU'RE HIGHER COST COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW ALL ARE NOT COMPENSATED BASED ON THAT SO THIS WITH A JUST FOR THAT. SO EVERYBODY GETS AN INCREASE BUT THE HIGH COST COUNTIES INCREASE ESCALATES A BIT MORE. OKAY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HI THERE MY NAME IS PATRICK MORE TEAR WITH FIGHT CRIME INVEST IN KIDS REPRESENTING OVER -- THREE HUNDRED PLEASE SHE SERVICE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ACROSS THE STATE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

DON THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS ANYMORE IN LARGE PART BECAUSE WE DON'T PROPERLY REIMBURSED FROM THE STATE CRIME CONTRACTED YOU SEE PROGRAM SO THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS THIS EXACT ISSUE.
