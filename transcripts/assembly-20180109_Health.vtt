SHEEPY GUIDELINES WE SHOULD BE

00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:45.057 region:rollup2
DOING THESE. I PERSONALLY LESSEN

00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:45.891 region:rollup2
A THIRD OF CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:48.327 region:rollup2

FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AND

00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:58.470 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO BETTER.

00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:59.605 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.739 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY THIS EARLY

00:28:59.605 --> 00:29:01.807 region:rollup2
IDENTIFICATION IS SO IMPORTANT

00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:02.941 region:rollup2
IS AS WAS MENTIONED BETWEEN THE

00:29:01.807 --> 00:29:03.675 region:rollup2
AGES OF ZERO THREE. THAT'S THE

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:05.244 region:rollup2
PRIME TIME THAT THE CHILD'S

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:06.478 region:rollup2
BRAIN IS THE MOST PLASTIC WE

00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:07.446 region:rollup2
CALL IT KNOW PLASTICITY WHICH

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:09.247 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE YOU

00:29:07.446 --> 00:29:11.149 region:rollup2
CAN STIMULATE. YOU CAN GROW YOU

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:13.118 region:rollup2
CAN IMPACT A CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:15.187 region:rollup2
AND BY THAT YOU CAN IMPACT AND

00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:16.755 region:rollup2
OPTIMIZE THEIR FUTURE.

00:29:15.187 --> 00:29:18.357 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I WAS

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:19.091 region:rollup2
HONORED TO GET AT LARGE SCALE

00:29:18.357 --> 00:29:20.759 region:rollup2
GRANT TO STANDARDIZE

00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:22.227 region:rollup2
OPERATIONALIZE DEVELOPMENTAL

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:23.028 region:rollup2
SCREENING IN MY CLINIC SYSTEMS

00:29:22.227 --> 00:29:24.496 region:rollup2
AND I'M PROUD TO SAY AFTER THREE

00:29:23.028 --> 00:29:25.964 region:rollup2
YEARS. WE'VE GONE FROM A

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:27.766 region:rollup2
SCREENING RATE OF TWENTY SIX

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:29.401 region:rollup2
PERCENT TO NINETY SIX PERCENT.

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:31.737 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SCREENED EIGHT THOUSAND

00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:33.739 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IN EAST LOS ANGELES WE

00:29:31.737 --> 00:29:34.940 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS A

00:29:33.739 --> 00:29:36.508 region:rollup2
SCREEN THAT DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.744 region:rollup2
RISKS IS BY TWELVE POINT NINE

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:40.545 region:rollup2
PERCENT. OF SEVERE TEN TWENTY

00:29:38.744 --> 00:29:42.247 region:rollup2
PERCENT DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY IN

00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:43.548 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITIES AND I'M PROUD TO

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:45.417 region:rollup2
SAY THAT WE HAVE CONNECTED

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:46.752 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR

00:29:45.417 --> 00:29:48.654 region:rollup2

SERVICES.

00:29:48.654 --> 00:29:51.290 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE

00:29:49.821 --> 00:29:52.924 region:rollup2
HERE I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:54.092 region:rollup2
THESE RESOURCES ALREADY EXIST WE

00:29:52.924 --> 00:29:55.527 region:rollup2
ARE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE DOING

00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:56.962 region:rollup2
THIS AND WE SHOULD BE ALLOCATING

AN ARTICLE LAST YEAR LOOKING AT

00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:32.717 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING AS WHAT AT THE

KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCREENING

00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:54.105 region:rollup2

00:32:52.404 --> 00:32:55.373 region:rollup2
SEEN BY ONLY PEDIATRICIANS BUT

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:57.642 region:rollup2
MID LEVEL PROVIDERS FAMILY

00:32:55.373 --> 00:32:59.578 region:rollup2
PRACTICE EVEN ADULT PROVIDERS

00:32:57.642 --> 00:33:00.712 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF TIMES. IT DEPENDING

00:32:59.578 --> 00:33:01.780 region:rollup2
ON YOUR RESIDENTS IN MEDICAL

00:33:00.712 --> 00:33:02.814 region:rollup2
SCHOOL EDUCATION YOU MAY NOT

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.716 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT THE

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:05.917 region:rollup2
VALIDATED SCREENING TOOLS. AND

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:07.552 region:rollup2
THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION IN THE

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:08.420 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THAT DIVERT MENTAL

00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:09.888 region:rollup2
SURVEILLANCE EQUALS

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.122 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING

00:33:09.888 --> 00:33:12.624 region:rollup2
SURVEILLANCE IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:13.758 region:rollup2
A CHILD TWO MONTHS THEY SHOULD

00:33:12.624 --> 00:33:15.227 region:rollup2
BE SMILE THEY SHOULD BE GOING.

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:16.528 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS ACTUALLY

00:33:15.227 --> 00:33:17.529 region:rollup2
DOING A FORMALIZED DEVELOPMENTAL

00:33:16.528 --> 00:33:19.798 region:rollup2
SCREEN.

00:33:17.529 --> 00:33:21.633 region:rollup2
AND AND MOST PROVIDERS ACTUALLY

00:33:19.798 --> 00:33:23.168 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT UNDERSTAND

00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:24.669 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS THAT DIFFERENCE.

00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:26.805 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO RELIANCE ON

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:27.906 region:rollup2
FAMILIES TO REPORT PROBLEMS AND

00:33:26.805 --> 00:33:30.008 region:rollup2
THAT'S ACTUALLY IN ARE

00:33:27.906 --> 00:33:31.610 region:rollup2
PREDOMINATELY TINO POPULATION WE

00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:32.944 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT. A LOT OF THE

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.212 region:rollup2
FAMILIES DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
