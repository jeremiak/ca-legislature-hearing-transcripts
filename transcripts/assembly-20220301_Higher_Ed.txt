ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I WANT TO START FIRST OF ALL BY- OF. LETTING OUT THE COMMITTEE KNOWS HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE. I AM GLAD TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THE BILL BEFORE YOU AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY ONE WOULD PROHIBIT. ANY CALIFORNIA COLLEGE WHO RECEIVES STATE FUNDING FOR FROM REDUCING SCHOLARSHIP FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS WHO ARE CURRENT. OR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. THE PRACTICE OF SCHOLARSHIP DISPLACEMENT CURVES WHEN STUDENTS RECEIVE A SCHOLARSHIP FROM A PRIVATE SOURCE AND IS REQUIRED TO REPORT THEIR EARNINGS TO THE SCHOOL. THAT SCHOOL CAN THEN REDUCE THE NUMBER FINANCIAL AID DOLLARS. THAT THE STUDENT RECEIVED LEAVING THE STUDENT WITH FEWER DOLLARS IN THEIR POCKET TO HELP WITH THE EVERYDAY NECESSITIES. THERE ARE ALREADY NUMEROUS- CHALLENGES THAT CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH BASE. SPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PURSUING A COLLEGE DEGREE AND SCHOLARSHIP DISPLACEMENT ONLY FURTHER COMPLICATES THAT DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE. WHILE MANY OF THE STUDENTS LACK FAMILY SUPPORT. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE THAT SO MANY OF THEIR PEERS RECEIVE. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAXIMIZE THEIR POTENTIAL THROUGH THE SCHOLARSHIPS AND FINANCIAL AID WITHOUT PENALTY. WITH THE RISING COSTS OF EVERYTHING AROUND US. IT'S RELATED TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND DAILY LIVING SOME PORTENT STEP REMOVING A FINANCIAL BURDEN PLACED ON INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN LEAST BEAR THAT BURDEN. AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY ONE WILL GIVE CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE A COLLEGE DEGREE WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT SO MUCH OF THE HEAVY LOAD OF THE COST. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE HEARING ROOM. AND EIGHTEEN T. MODERATOR ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE.

WELL THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE AND I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT I I'M AWARE OF THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THIS BILL AND AB TWO EIGHT EIGHT BUT I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL AS I AM OF AB TWO EIGHT EIGHT OF MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU THAT NO SCHOLARSHIP- DISPLACEMENT. SHOULD BE ALLOWED I HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AFTER YOUR QUESTION. THAT YEAH DR CHOI YOU GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION YEAH I WAS WONDERING WHY THIS HAS TO BE LIMITED TO ONLY FOSTER CURRENT FOSTER WALL FORMER FOSTER CHILDREN SO WHAT ABOUT THE MORE QUALIFIED DEVELOPMENTAL- THE RECIPIENTS. WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO MAKE IT TO BECAUSE A TO ME IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE SAYS JUST BECAUSE I GET THE FEDERAL GRANT THAT. ANY PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS I MADE YOU KNOW ALL ON MY OWN EFFORT I GET THE ADDITIONAL SCHOLARSHIPS UP AND UP MY PREVIOUS- GOVERNMENT CAPITAL GRANT THE WOULD BE REDUCED- IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. CAN YOU EXPANDED THAT TO INCLUDE THE ANY. ANY ANY BAD WHEN THE RECIPIENT SECOND BENEFIT THE SAME BENEFITS. MISTER CHAIR OF THE PARTY YOU YEAH. I JUST JUST TO SHARE THAT WITH MY COMMENT WAS THAT THERE IS A SIMILAR BILL MOVING FORWARD THAT THAT- THAT ENCOMPASSES. ANY STUDENT AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON BILL FOCUSES AND- UNDERSTANDABLY ON ON FOSTER YOU- BUT THE OTHER BUILT ENCOMPASSES ALL STUDENTS AND IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING SO REMEMBER THAT IF THE OTHER BILL YES WILL- FIRST OF ALL IN THE PERFECT WORLD. WOULD BE GREAT TO COVER EVERYBODY AND THE BILL YOU MENTIONED- I THINK TRIES TO DO THAT. THIS BILL THAT FOCUSED ON FOSTER AT KIDS. IF FOR SOME REASON THE BILL YOU.

THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB SIXTEEN TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS AS SIMPLE REASONABLE STEP THAT SEEKS TO FURHER AMPLIFY THE VOICE OF STUDENTS AND INCREASE THE PARITY ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. THE STUDENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES EXERCISE A CRITICAL ROLE. REPRESENTING MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO STUDENT MEMBERS ON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. HOWEVER THERE IS CURRENTLY A LACK OF PARITY. BETWEEN FACULTY MEMBERS ON THE BOARD AND STUDENT MEMBERS ON THE BOARD. ON THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF FACULTY MEMBER IS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN OFFICE AFTER THE TERM EXPIRES FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR OF THE GOVERNOR IS NOT APPOINTED SUCCESSOR. THIS IS NOT THE CASE FOR STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES ON THE BOARD THEREFORE THIS RISK A LACK OF STUDENT REPRESENTATION AND INPUT BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE IS FINISHED THIRD TERM. AND THE GOVERNOR HAS APPOINTED HIS SUCCESSOR. ASHLEY NOW DURING THE COLD NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE STUDENT VOICE IS NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO DIMINISH THEIR INPUT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF PARITY IN STATE CODE. AB SIXTEEN TWENTY FIVE RECTIFY IS THE LACK OF PARITY. BY GRANTING THE STUDENT TRUSTEE AN ADDITIONAL SEMESTER TO CONTINUE SERVING IN THE ROLE WHEREBY PROFESSORS CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLE FOR SEMESTER. UNTIL THE GOVERNOR FILLS THE VACANCY. AB SIXTEEN TWENTY FIVE ALLOWS THE STUDENT TRUSTEE WHOSE TERM IS EXPIRING TO REMAIN IN OFFICE. UNTIL JANUARY WIDE UNTIL A SUCCESSOR IS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST SIMPLE YET IMPORTANT CLEAN UP BILL TO FURTHER EMPOWER THE VOICE OF STUDENTS ON THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT ASSOCIATION- TO TESTIFY ON THE PHONE IN SUPPORT AND FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS. CHRISTIAN. HANNAH BRAG STEAD FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT ASSOCIATION. OKAY THANK YOU- DO YOU HAVE ANY. SUPPORT WITNESSES YES WE HAVE A SUPPORT WITNESS ON THE PHONE OKAY- SUPPORT WITNESS A WIN IF YOU'RE ALREADY AHEAD THE FIRST TWO MINUTES.

SEE IF THE STATE IS PROUD TO SPONSOR OF THE BILL SIXTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND WE ARE GRATEFUL TO CHAIRMAN ENOUGH FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AB SIXTEEN TWENTY FIVE WOULD ALLOW THE STUDENT TRUSTEE WHOSE TERM IS EXPIRING TO REMAIN IN OFFICE UNTIL JANUARY FIRST OR UNTIL A SUCCESSOR IS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST. VISIT CREE PARITY WITH THE FACT THAT THE TEST TRUSTEE WHO HAD THE GRACE PERIOD OF UP TO ONE YEAR. UNTIL A SUCCESSOR IS APPOINTED. THE THING IS CURRENTLY WITH THE- WHAT THE FINAL. ON EIGHTY FIVE FOURTEEN INTO NINETEEN. WHICH GRANTED BOTH TRUST VOTING. ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE YOU. FOR OF TRUSTEES. STUDENT TRUSTEE THIRTEEN YEAR TERM THAT ARE SO TO BEGIN ON JULY. AND EXPIRE ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWO YEARS AFTER. IN THE LAST FIVE SIX YEARS THE STUDENT TRUSTEE POSITION HAS BEEN APPOINTED IN AUGUST CREATING A VACANCY FOR THE SECOND STUDENT TRUSTEE AT THE JULY BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING. YOU TO BOTH CHIU INTERESTED NOW HAVING THE RIGHT TO VOTE IT'S CRITICAL THAT BOTH POSITIONS REMAIN FILLED TO ENSURE THE STUDENT VOICES HEARD AND ALWAYS PART OF DECISION MAKING. IN THE CASE OF A CLOSE VOTE OR IMPORTANT POLICY DISCUSSION NOT HAVING POSTED REPRESENTATION AND VOICE IN THE SPACES. CAN DRASTICALLY ALTER THE COURSE OF ACTION AT THE KEY ISSUE TAKE. STUDENT INPUT IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY CRUCIAL IN MAKING DECISIONS WHICH IS WHY WE'RE SO SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. FOR THESE REASONS. THEY ARE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB SIXTEEN TWENTY FIVE THANK. YOU OKAY ANY OTHER. SUPPORT WITNESS. WHAT- A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN OF BAGHDAD WITH THE CONCRETE IN THE NATION AND THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS- SHOULD THEY COME.
