COME FORWARD EXPOSING INTERNAL

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.418
DOCUMENTS SHOWING THAT FACEBOOK

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:04.920
ACTIVELY CENSORS CONTENT THAT

01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:06.655
IS CONSIDERED VACCINE HESITANT.

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:08.124
MEANING THEY CENSOR ANYTHING

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.358
THAT IS CONSIDERED NEGATIVE

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:11.494
ABOUT VACCINATION. OR COULD

MAKE A PERSON VACCINE HESITANT.

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.464

THE INFORMATION IS TRUE OR NOT.

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:22.238
I BELIEVE THE ACTUAL INTENTION

01:07:22.304 --> 01:07:24.206
OF THIS BILL IS AN EXTENSION OF

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:25.574
THE SAME CENSORSHIP THAT IS

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:27.209
HAPPENING ON FACEBOOK AND OTHER

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:29.311
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. I DO

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:30.312
NOT THINK THIS BILL HAS

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:31.547
ANYTHING TO DO WITH PEOPLE

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:33.849
INTIMIDATING OR BULLYING PEOPLE

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.951

POLICE IN L. A. COUNTY MADE IT

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:47.463
A POINT TO ISSUE A PUBLIC

01:07:52.067 --> 01:07:54.103
VACCINATION SITE. ALL

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:05.781
BY DEFINING THE WORD HARASS IN

BILL. THOSE THREE THINGS ARE

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:18.093
NOT HARASSING. IF SOMEONE TAKES

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.296
A FLYER FROM AN ACTIVIST IT IS

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.431
ACCEPTED. NO ONE CAN FORCE THE

01:08:22.498 --> 01:08:23.899
FLYER ON TO SOMEONE AND FORCE

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.134
THEM TO READ IT WHEN AN

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:26.335

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:27.069
FLYER FROM ONE OF OUR

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:30.973

THEIR OWN FREE WILL HAVE

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.709
ACCEPTED IT. THE BILL IS

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.778
ATTEMPTING TO STOP THAT FROM

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:37.546
HAPPENING. I BELIEVE THE TRUE

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.415
INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS TO

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:41.517

INTENTION OF THE BILL I WOULD

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:50.693
KINDLY ASK THE AUTHOR TO REMOVE

THE PART THAT DEFINES

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:54.730
HARASSMENT. AS EDUCATION.

01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:56.732

01:44:37.237 --> 01:44:38.905
DO THINK THE OPPOSITION HAS

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:41.975
SOME POINTS FIRST OF ALL THE

THIRTY FOOT DISTANCE. THERE'S

01:44:45.579 --> 01:44:48.548
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE I KNOW

01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:50.751

IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:09.603
THAT EVEN INDOORS YOU CAN DO IT

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.004

01:45:12.572 --> 01:45:15.609
RIGHT. BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK

01:45:15.676 --> 01:45:17.944
THAT THAT MEASURE AND PROBABLY

01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:19.246
SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT YOU

REALLY CAN'T SUPPORT- I THINK

02:27:07.151 --> 02:27:08.753
YOU KNOW I GET MONEY FROM LABOR

02:27:08.819 --> 02:27:11.656
UNIONS. I WROTE ALL THE TIME ON

02:27:11.722 --> 02:27:14.091
THINGS THAT AFFECT THEM. AND I

02:27:14.158 --> 02:27:16.260
REALLY DO THINK- IF YOU'RE

02:27:16.327 --> 02:27:18.329
SUSPICIOUS OF DJS YOU SHOULD BE

02:27:18.396 --> 02:27:21.432
SUSPICIOUS OF LEGISLATORS. IN

02:27:21.499 --> 02:27:24.101
TERMS OF WHY THERE AREN'T MORE

02:27:24.168 --> 02:27:25.703
PROSECUTIONS FIRST OF ALL THE

02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:27.004
WAY THE LAW WAS WRITTEN IT WAS

02:27:27.071 --> 02:27:28.973
JUST VERY HARD AND PARTICULARLY

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:30.641
INTERPRETATIONS BY THE SUPREME

02:27:30.708 --> 02:27:32.910
COURT. IT WAS JUST VERY HARD

02:27:32.977 --> 02:27:36.013
BECAUSE IF THE OFFICER HAD ANY

02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:39.650
KIND OF JUSTIFIABLE FEAR. YOU

02:27:39.717 --> 02:27:44.422
COULDN'T PROSECUTE THEM AND SO-

02:27:44.488 --> 02:27:45.590
ONE OF THE RARE CASES WAS IN

02:27:45.656 --> 02:27:47.725
ALAMEDA COUNTY WHERE I LIVE

02:27:47.792 --> 02:27:50.628
WHERE THEY- PROSECUTED SOMEONE

02:27:50.695 --> 02:27:52.997
WHO SAID THAT HE GRABBED HIS

02:27:53.064 --> 02:27:57.635
GUN WHEN HE MEANT TO GRAB HIS-

02:27:57.702 --> 02:28:02.340
TASER. AND ARM AND KILLED THE

02:28:02.406 --> 02:28:04.709
YOUNG MAN AT A BART STATION. HE

02:28:04.775 --> 02:28:05.810
WAS PROSECUTED FOR

02:28:05.876 --> 02:28:07.979
MANSLAUGHTER. ACTUALLY HE WAS

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:10.314
PROSECUTED FOR MURDER BUT THEY

02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:10.748
GOT A CONVICTION FOR

02:28:10.815 --> 02:28:14.418
MANSLAUGHTER- WE THERE IS A

02:28:14.485 --> 02:28:16.420
CURRENTLY PROSECUTION GOING ON

02:28:16.487 --> 02:28:19.790
IN ALAMEDA COUNTY NOW. ARE WITH

02:28:19.857 --> 02:28:21.192
AND THE ONLY REASON IT'S GOING

02:28:21.259 --> 02:28:22.960
ON IS THAT WE PASSED A BILL

02:28:23.027 --> 02:28:25.196
THAT MAKES IT SO YOU HAVE TO

02:28:25.263 --> 02:28:26.998
GET YOU CAN ONLY USE FORCE WHEN

02:28:27.064 --> 02:28:29.700
IT'S NECESSARY. AND BECAUSE OF

02:28:29.767 --> 02:28:33.037
THAT MY DA IS ABLE TO NOW

02:28:33.104 --> 02:28:35.640
PROSECUTING OFFICER WHO SHOT

02:28:35.706 --> 02:28:39.577
SOMEONE WHO HAD A BASEBALL BAT.

02:28:39.644 --> 02:28:42.480
AND YEAH SO I THINK THINGS ARE

02:28:42.546 --> 02:28:44.482
CHANGING- BUT I DON'T THINK

02:28:44.548 --> 02:28:45.883
THIS IS A WAY TO PROMOTE MORE

02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:50.488
CHANGE- THE REASON WHY-

02:28:50.554 --> 02:28:53.924
PROSECUTORS AND POLICE I THINK.

02:28:53.991 --> 02:28:55.393
DO YOU OFTEN SEE THINGS THE

02:28:55.459 --> 02:28:57.495
SAME WAY AS THE NATURE OF WHAT

02:28:57.561 --> 02:28:59.297
THEY DO IN THE COOPERATION

02:28:59.363 --> 02:29:01.232
THAT'S BETWEEN THEM. AND I

02:29:01.299 --> 02:29:02.300
DON'T THINK THIS WILL CHANGE

02:29:02.366 --> 02:29:05.069
ANY OF THAT SO I WON'T BE

02:29:05.136 --> 02:29:05.670
VOTING FOR YOUR BILL TODAY I'M

02:29:05.736 --> 02:29:10.107
SORRY. ANYONE ELSE. HERE TO

02:29:10.174 --> 02:29:12.677
READ. THANK YOU SENATOR

02:29:12.743 --> 02:29:14.912
BRADFORD FROM THE REPRESENTING

02:29:14.979 --> 02:29:18.649
YOUR BILL TODAY AND- YEAH ONE

02:29:18.716 --> 02:29:19.250
OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ABOUT

02:29:19.317 --> 02:29:22.386
THIS IS. SO THE DA RECUSES

02:29:22.453 --> 02:29:24.689
HIMSELF WHO PROSECUTES. ARTISTS

02:29:24.755 --> 02:29:26.157
EITHER TOURNEY GENERAL ATTORNEY

02:29:26.223 --> 02:29:27.658
GENERAL HAS A CONFLICT AS WELL

02:29:27.725 --> 02:29:29.427
BILLS ASSIGNORS SPECIALLY

02:29:29.493 --> 02:29:31.028
GENERAL IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THIS

02:29:31.095 --> 02:29:32.897
YES SO YOU'RE SAYING GOES FROM

02:29:32.963 --> 02:29:35.032
FROM THE DA'S OFFICE UP TO THE

02:29:35.099 --> 02:29:39.370
STATE LEVEL. AND SO AND IF

02:29:39.437 --> 02:29:39.970
THERE'S A CONFLICT THERE IS A

02:29:40.037 --> 02:29:41.472
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. OKAY

02:29:41.539 --> 02:29:44.308
BECAUSE- YEAH I THINK ONE OF

02:29:44.375 --> 02:29:47.578
THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS IS THAT-

02:29:47.645 --> 02:29:49.947
DATE WE ARE THE OBVIOUSLY IF

02:29:50.014 --> 02:29:52.917
THE DA HIMSELF. IS SUPPOSEDLY

02:29:52.983 --> 02:29:54.852
UNDER THIS GUY THE GUYS OF I'M

02:29:54.919 --> 02:29:57.621
GOING TO NOT BE FAIR AND

02:29:57.688 --> 02:29:59.490
IMPARTIAL BECAUSE I'VE ACCEPTED

02:29:59.557 --> 02:30:01.892
CONTRIBUTION. I DON'T KNOW

02:30:01.959 --> 02:30:03.127
WHERE THAT STOPS IT CERTAINLY

02:30:03.194 --> 02:30:05.329
DOESN'T STOP ANY ORGANIZATION

02:30:05.396 --> 02:30:06.931
BECAUSE EVERY WORKS FOR HIM.

02:30:06.997 --> 02:30:08.966
AND SO WE'RE WE'RE BASICALLY

02:30:09.033 --> 02:30:10.768
TAKING ALL THESE AND PUTTING

02:30:10.835 --> 02:30:13.871
THEM INTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S LAP.

02:30:13.938 --> 02:30:16.574
AND AND LOSING THAT THAT

02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:19.710
CONTROL OF FOR THAT AREA THAT

02:30:19.777 --> 02:30:22.947
LOCAL AREA IN THAT COMMUNITY-

02:30:23.013 --> 02:30:26.450
SO- IT ALSO ASSUMES THAT DID A

02:30:26.517 --> 02:30:28.619
DA WOULD WANT TO PROTECT.

02:30:28.686 --> 02:30:33.057
BECAUSE AN ORGANIZATION HAS-

02:30:33.124 --> 02:30:34.291
SUPPORTED HIM HE WOULD WANT TO

02:30:34.358 --> 02:30:38.529
PROTECT A ONE ONE BAD OFFICER

02:30:38.596 --> 02:30:40.131
AND MOST OF THE DA-

02:30:40.197 --> 02:30:43.901
PROSECUTIONS- THAT I'VE SEEN-

02:30:43.968 --> 02:30:44.702
OR SITUATIONS WHERE THEY DO

02:30:44.769 --> 02:30:49.173
HAVE. OFFICERS THAT HAVE- BEEN

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:50.908
UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR

02:30:50.975 --> 02:30:52.977
WHATEVER ISSUE IT IS THERE'S A

02:30:53.043 --> 02:30:55.713
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF. PUBLICITY

02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:58.182
INVOLVED IN THOSE AND THERE'S A

02:30:58.249 --> 02:30:58.949
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE

02:30:59.016 --> 02:31:02.219
ON THEM- BY ONE GROUP TO

02:31:02.286 --> 02:31:03.454
PROSECUTE THE HECK OUT OF

02:31:03.521 --> 02:31:06.624
SOMETHING AND BY THE OTHER TO

02:31:06.690 --> 02:31:11.862
ADMINISTER A FAIR PROCESS. AND.

02:31:11.929 --> 02:31:12.496
AND THE MOST OF THE TIME I HAVE

02:31:12.563 --> 02:31:16.200
SEEN THEM. I LAND- WHERE THE

02:31:16.267 --> 02:31:17.635
LAW TELLS THEM THEY HAVE TO

02:31:17.701 --> 02:31:18.803
LAND BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR

02:31:18.869 --> 02:31:20.404
PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATION TO THE

02:31:20.471 --> 02:31:22.440
PEOPLE THAT ELECTED THEM IT'S

02:31:22.506 --> 02:31:24.241
THEIR JOB THE PEOPLE ELECTED

02:31:24.308 --> 02:31:27.211
THEM TO DO THAT JOB AND I DON'T

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:30.581
THINK- THIS. CREATES A

02:31:30.648 --> 02:31:32.016
SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:31:32.082 --> 02:31:34.251
GOING TO BE IMPARTIAL AND I

02:31:34.318 --> 02:31:37.621
HAVE NOT SEEN OUR- YOU KNOW

02:31:37.688 --> 02:31:40.891
THE- PLA'S UNIONS AT CENTRO

02:31:40.958 --> 02:31:42.526
WHEN OFFICER BELONGS TO A UNION

02:31:42.593 --> 02:31:45.029
THEY'RE OBLIGATED BY LAW. TO

02:31:45.095 --> 02:31:46.163
REPRESENT THEM THAT DOESN'T

02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:48.866
MEAN THEY WANT A BAD OFFICER TO

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:51.769
STAY IN THE RANKS- THEY JUST

02:31:51.836 --> 02:31:53.604
HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DEFENSE AND

02:31:53.671 --> 02:31:55.272
THE DEFENSE WILL PUT ON THERE.

02:31:55.339 --> 02:31:58.409
IT DID ATTORNEY WILL I MEAN THE

02:31:58.476 --> 02:31:59.009
DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILL PUT ON

02:31:59.076 --> 02:32:02.346
THEIR CASE- AND I DON'T SEE

02:32:02.413 --> 02:32:06.317
THAT. IF WE'RE GOING TO ACCUSE

02:32:06.383 --> 02:32:10.654
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OF BEING-

02:32:10.721 --> 02:32:12.823
BEING AN ETHICAL BASICALLY

02:32:12.890 --> 02:32:15.259
BASED ON CONTRIBUTIONS HI DAD

02:32:15.326 --> 02:32:18.662
AND- I THINK THE CITIZENS WOULD

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:20.331
SEE THROUGH THAT AND HOLD THEM

02:32:20.397 --> 02:32:22.533
ACCOUNTABLE AT THE BALLOT BOX

02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:23.234
SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE

02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:24.702
ACCOUNTABILITY IS IT'S WITH THE

02:32:24.768 --> 02:32:27.238
CITIZENS AND IF YOU HAVE A

02:32:27.304 --> 02:32:28.906
PROSECUTE AG A DISTRICT

02:32:28.973 --> 02:32:30.040
ATTORNEY THAT'S NOT GOING TO

02:32:30.107 --> 02:32:33.644
PROSECUTE ANY POLICE. ISSUES

02:32:33.711 --> 02:32:35.312
WHEN THERE COULD BE A VERY

02:32:35.379 --> 02:32:37.715
OBVIOUS CASE A PERSON CAN GET

02:32:37.781 --> 02:32:41.485
REMOVED IN OFFICE IT'S HAPPENED

02:32:41.552 --> 02:32:44.755
BEFORE. AND IN DEVICE VERSA TO

02:32:44.822 --> 02:32:45.823
WHEN SOMEBODY SEES SOMETHING

02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:49.126
WHERE- OTHER PEOPLE ARE GETTING

02:32:49.193 --> 02:32:51.295
PROSECUTED. THEY WIND UP

02:32:51.362 --> 02:32:53.597
GETTING RECALLS OR BOARD

02:32:53.664 --> 02:32:55.299
REMOVED ENOUGH FROM OFFICE AND

02:32:55.366 --> 02:32:57.635
EXTEND THE RUN. SO IT'S

02:32:57.701 --> 02:33:00.638
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GO DOWN

02:33:00.704 --> 02:33:02.406
THIS PATH OF MISTRUST OF A

02:33:02.473 --> 02:33:05.743
DISTRICT ATTORNEY- THEY HAVE AN

02:33:05.809 --> 02:33:07.811
OATH THEY THEY THEY TAKE AN

02:33:07.878 --> 02:33:12.716
OATH- TO UPHOLD THE LAW. AND IF

02:33:12.783 --> 02:33:13.450
THEY DON'T THEY WON'T BE

02:33:13.517 --> 02:33:15.886
ATTORNEYS BECAUSE OF THE BAR

02:33:15.953 --> 02:33:18.656
WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT. SO I

02:33:18.722 --> 02:33:20.024
STRUGGLE WITH THAT THIS IS A

02:33:20.090 --> 02:33:22.760
STRUGGLE WITH THIS A LOT. AND I

02:33:22.826 --> 02:33:25.029
DON'T DIE I CAN'T SEE THAT I

02:33:25.095 --> 02:33:30.568
CAN SUPPORT IT. THANK. ANY

02:33:30.634 --> 02:33:32.803

02:33:37.541 --> 02:33:39.076
OURSELVES IN A VERY UNIQUE

02:33:39.143 --> 02:33:41.745
SITUATION FAR DIFFERENT THAN A

02:33:41.812 --> 02:33:43.147
CITY COUNCIL PERSON FAR

02:33:43.213 --> 02:33:43.914
DIFFERENT THAN A LEGISLATIVE

02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:46.317
BODY WHO TAKES A CONTRIBUTION

02:33:46.383 --> 02:33:48.819
AGAIN WE DON'T DETERMINE LIFE

02:33:48.886 --> 02:33:51.088
OR DEATH WE DON'T DETERMINE THE

02:33:51.155 --> 02:33:52.790
BILITY OF SENDING SOMEONE TO

02:33:52.856 --> 02:33:54.658
AND CHARGING SOMEONE. IF THIS

02:33:54.725 --> 02:33:56.427
IS A PERFECT WORLD THEN YOU

02:33:56.493 --> 02:33:59.296
WOULD HAVE MORE THAN 1% OF

02:33:59.363 --> 02:34:02.933
OFFICERS CHARGED IN LESS THAN

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.970
THAT CONVICTED IF THIS IS FAIR

02:34:06.036 --> 02:34:06.770
THERE IS INCESTUOUS

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:09.006
RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS

02:34:09.073 --> 02:34:11.642
BETWEEN ONE FOUR SUBMIT NDAS

02:34:11.709 --> 02:34:14.345
AND JUDGES AND IT'S HISTORICAL

SHOOTINGS. IN THE LAST TWO

02:34:20.784 --> 02:34:21.318
YEARS. HOW MANY OFFICERS WERE

NEIGHBOR WHICH ONE IS MOST

02:34:31.795 --> 02:34:36.033
BRILLIANT. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:36.634
PROBABLY AN L. A. COUNTY HAVE

02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:39.236
NOT TO STATE. HE WAS APPOINTED

02:34:39.303 --> 02:34:40.971
TO THE BENCH A NUMBER OF YEARS

02:34:41.038 --> 02:34:44.375
AGO. AFTER TWO YEARS ON THE

BENCH HE RESULT HE RESIGNED

02:34:46.944 --> 02:34:48.278
BECAUSE OF THE INCESTUOUS

02:34:48.345 --> 02:34:49.680
RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTED

02:34:49.747 --> 02:34:51.515
BETWEEN THE D. EIGHT AND THE

02:34:51.582 --> 02:34:52.983
INVESTIGATORS OF POLICE

02:34:53.050 --> 02:34:54.618
SHOOTINGS BECAUSE WHO

02:34:54.685 --> 02:34:56.387
INVESTIGATES POLICE SHOOTINGS

02:34:56.453 --> 02:34:58.889
OTHER POLICE OFFICERS AND THE

02:34:58.956 --> 02:35:00.891
MAJORITY OF JUDGES COULD EVEN

02:35:00.958 --> 02:35:02.259
GET JUDGES TO GO ALONG EVEN IN

02:35:02.326 --> 02:35:03.961
A GRAND JURY INDICTMENT LIKE TO

02:35:04.028 --> 02:35:05.496
SAY IT'S EASIER TO INDICT A HAM

02:35:05.562 --> 02:35:08.599
SANDWICH THAN A- THAN A POLICE

02:35:08.666 --> 02:35:11.201
OFFICER. AND MY GOOD NEIGHBOR

02:35:11.268 --> 02:35:15.539

PRIOR TO GOING TO THE BENCH D.

02:35:17.775 --> 02:35:19.677
EIGHT. AND IT'S A CLEAR

02:35:19.743 --> 02:35:21.645
INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP.

02:35:21.712 --> 02:35:24.281
BETWEEN OFFICERS AND ALL WE'RE

A CONFLICT YOU WOULD HAVE MORE

02:35:34.625 --> 02:35:37.828
THAN 1% OF OFFICER BEING CHARGE.

02:35:37.895 --> 02:35:39.163

EXISTED FOR OVER A HUNDRED

02:35:47.137 --> 02:35:48.472
YEARS AND IT'S FAR DIFFERENT

02:35:48.539 --> 02:35:50.274

WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FAR

02:36:01.285 --> 02:36:02.886

02:36:15.399 --> 02:36:18.001
THAT- GUIDELINES THAT ARE FAR

02:36:18.068 --> 02:36:19.403
DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING THAT WE

HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR SO

02:36:21.305 --> 02:36:23.140
IN ORDER TO BUILD TRUST. WE

NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THIS

02:36:25.876 --> 02:36:27.711
IS ABOUT TRUST AGAIN. MOST OF

02:36:27.778 --> 02:36:30.614

THEY'RE STILL WORKING TODAY NO

02:36:37.688 --> 02:36:39.022
ONE FOUND GUILTY OF ANYTHING

02:36:39.089 --> 02:36:40.824
AND WE SAW ALL IN LIVING COLOR

02:36:40.891 --> 02:36:42.159
HOW MANY MORE BRIANNA TAYLOR'S

FLOYD DOING BUT MOST OF THOSE

02:36:45.362 --> 02:36:46.630
OFFICERS ARE NEVER CONVICTED IF

02:36:46.697 --> 02:36:50.067
IT WASN'T FOR VIDEO TAPE DEREK

02:36:50.134 --> 02:36:50.667
SHOPPING WOULD BE WALKING THE

02:36:50.734 --> 02:36:52.102
STREETS TODAY. BECAUSE NO DA

02:36:52.169 --> 02:36:55.105
WOULD HAVE PROSECUTED THIS GUY.

02:36:55.172 --> 02:36:57.141
NO D. A. WHAT IT CHARGES GOT.

02:36:57.207 --> 02:36:59.476
THIS IS ABOUT RIGHTING A WRONG

02:36:59.543 --> 02:37:00.878
THIS IS ABOUT LOOKING AT

02:37:00.944 --> 02:37:02.546
HISTORICAL PRACTICES THAT

02:37:02.613 --> 02:37:04.515
EXISTED BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:37:04.581 --> 02:37:06.416
COMMUNITY AND BUILDING TRUST

02:37:06.483 --> 02:37:08.252
AND PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY AND

02:37:08.318 --> 02:37:10.621
MOVIE REMOVING THAT INCESTUOUS

02:37:10.687 --> 02:37:13.190
RELATIONSHIP THEY CLEARLY

02:37:13.257 --> 02:37:13.791
EXISTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK

02:37:13.857 --> 02:37:18.028
RIVAL. AND I TO MISTER BRADFORD

02:37:18.095 --> 02:37:18.662
I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

02:37:18.729 --> 02:37:21.732
YEAR- I THOUGHT LONG AND HARD

02:37:21.799 --> 02:37:24.334
ABOUT. ACTUALLY ALTERING THIS

02:37:24.401 --> 02:37:26.503
BILL AND I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD

02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:30.007
BE A LITTLE. TO RESTRICTIVE

02:37:30.073 --> 02:37:32.309
WELL WHEN I LOOK AT THIS IT IS

02:37:32.376 --> 02:37:34.711
THIS TERM PERCEPTION IS REALITY.

02:37:34.778 --> 02:37:36.547
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT JUDGES AND

02:37:36.613 --> 02:37:38.115
WE KNOW A LOT OF JUDGES IT

02:37:38.182 --> 02:37:40.117
CAN'T CONTRIBUTED CAMPAIGNS

02:37:40.184 --> 02:37:42.586
THEY CAN'T ENDORSE THINGS AND

02:37:42.653 --> 02:37:44.354
WE HAVE MORE FAITH IN THEIR

02:37:44.421 --> 02:37:47.791
JUDGMENT. AND WE DO WITH OTHER

02:37:47.858 --> 02:37:49.459
MEMBERS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:37:49.526 --> 02:37:52.996
SYSTEM AND SO- I THINK THIS

02:37:53.063 --> 02:37:55.933
BILL IS A MEASURE BILL AND THAT

02:37:55.999 --> 02:37:58.135
YOU GIVE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR

02:37:58.202 --> 02:38:00.003
INDIVIDUAL TO STILL CONTRIBUTE

02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:02.072
AND YOU GIVE THEM STILL

02:38:02.139 --> 02:38:03.307
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE

02:38:03.373 --> 02:38:06.643
THEIR VOICE AND TO SPEAK IN THE

02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:08.278
IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM-

02:38:08.345 --> 02:38:09.746
WITHOUT RESTRICTING THEM AND

02:38:09.813 --> 02:38:12.583
SO- I THINK THIS THIS IS A GOOD

02:38:12.649 --> 02:38:15.252
COMPROMISE IN IN A LOT OF WAYS.

02:38:15.319 --> 02:38:17.554
AND THAT- WE SHOULD GO AHEAD

02:38:17.621 --> 02:38:19.089
AND NOT ONLY BOTH WHICH IS MOVE

02:38:19.156 --> 02:38:24.261
THIS ALONG. BUT- MAYBE D. A.

02:38:24.328 --> 02:38:26.096
SHOULD BE AT THE HIGHER RANK OF

02:38:26.163 --> 02:38:29.132
ART AT THE HIGHER. VISIBILITY

02:38:29.199 --> 02:38:31.034
OF WHAT THE JUDGES. BUT THAT'S

02:38:31.101 --> 02:38:33.170
FOR ANOTHER DAY RIGHT NOW LET'S

02:38:33.237 --> 02:38:35.339

02:54:44.907 --> 02:54:46.943
PARTICULARLY UNFAIR IN CASES

04:38:56.619 --> 04:38:57.620
THE VICTIM OF PACKAGED BACK

04:38:57.687 --> 04:38:59.956
SEVERAL TIMES I UNDERSTAND

04:39:00.023 --> 04:39:00.990
PEOPLE'S FRUSTRATION WITH THIS

04:39:01.057 --> 04:39:02.725
CRIME. THAT SAID WHEN SOMEONE

04:39:02.792 --> 04:39:04.627
COME BONTA MY COURTS AND FIELDS

04:39:04.694 --> 04:39:06.129

CHRISTMAS. IT IS NOT AN

04:39:12.902 --> 04:39:15.038
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE OR A JUST

04:39:15.105 --> 04:39:17.507
RESPONSE TO BLOCK THAT PERSON

04:39:17.574 --> 04:39:22.512
UP FOR A YEAR. THIS IS TRUE FOR

04:39:22.579 --> 04:39:23.413
SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST WE IT'S

04:39:23.480 --> 04:39:24.047
NOT GOING TO WORK TO REDUCE THE

04:39:24.114 --> 04:39:26.015
INCIDENCE OF PACKAGE THAT. MANY

04:39:26.082 --> 04:39:27.283
YEARS OF RESEARCH SHOW THAT AN

04:39:27.350 --> 04:39:28.818
INCREASE IN THE SEVERITY OF

04:39:28.885 --> 04:39:30.220
PUNISHMENT DOES NOTHING TO

04:39:30.286 --> 04:39:31.955
DETER FUTURE OFFENSES. IT'S

04:39:32.021 --> 04:39:35.191
GROWING MONEY AWAY SPENDING IT

04:39:35.258 --> 04:39:35.792
WITHOUT ANY BENEFIT TO PUBLIC

04:39:35.859 --> 04:39:37.927
SAFETY. SECOND IT DIRECTLY

04:39:37.994 --> 04:39:39.229
CONTRAVENES THE WILL OF

04:39:39.295 --> 04:39:40.897
CALIFORNIA VOTERS AND ENACTING

04:39:40.964 --> 04:39:42.932
PROP FORTY SEVEN. THE VOTERS

04:39:42.999 --> 04:39:44.134
UNDERSTOOD THAT SPENDING THE

04:39:44.200 --> 04:39:45.568
STATE'S MONEY ON LOCKING UP LOW

04:39:45.635 --> 04:39:46.836

04:39:46.903 --> 04:39:48.238
PERIODS OF TIME WITH WASTEFUL

04:39:48.304 --> 04:39:50.940
AND INEFFECTIVE AND THEY OPTED

04:39:51.007 --> 04:39:52.308
TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT APPROACH.

04:39:52.375 --> 04:39:53.977
FINALLY WE KNOW THAT ANY

04:39:54.043 --> 04:39:55.678
INCREASE IN PUNISHMENT FOR THIS

04:39:55.745 --> 04:39:57.547
TYPE OF LOW LEVEL CRIME. IS

04:39:57.614 --> 04:39:58.081
GOING TO FALL

04:39:58.148 --> 04:40:00.283

MEANINGFUL STEPS TO MOVE TOWARD

04:45:39.689 --> 04:45:41.023
MISTER MISTER WITH QUESTION I'D

LIKE TO CONTINUE TO ASK IF I

04:45:42.625 --> 04:45:44.126
WANT YOU TO ADDRESS MAYBE WHY

04:45:44.193 --> 04:45:45.661
WE'RE HEARING- THE OPPOSITE

04:45:45.728 --> 04:45:49.432
BECAUSE- IN AND OUT BECAUSE OF

04:45:49.499 --> 04:45:50.700
THE I MEAN THE ARGUMENT ABOUT-

04:45:50.766 --> 04:45:51.868
THE ARGUMENT ABOUT INCREASING

04:45:51.934 --> 04:45:53.636
FEES AND PENALTIES AND SUPPORT.

04:45:53.703 --> 04:45:55.505
DOES NOT SIT WELL WITH ME WHEN

04:45:55.571 --> 04:45:59.242
IT COMES TO. A SERVICE TO A TO

04:45:59.308 --> 04:46:01.177
THIS PARTICULAR- ITEM BUT- WHY

04:46:01.244 --> 04:46:02.778
THEN WOULD SOMEBODY MAKE THAT

04:46:02.845 --> 04:46:05.815
ARGUMENT WELL I THINK BASED ON

04:46:05.882 --> 04:46:08.417

AREN'T COVERED. UNDER THIS CODE

04:46:14.657 --> 04:46:17.660
AND SO THERE'S SOME DEBATE ON.

04:46:17.727 --> 04:46:20.696
ON YOU KNOW HOW- POLICE AND

04:46:20.763 --> 04:46:22.532
PROSECUTORS NEED TO PROSECUTE

04:46:22.598 --> 04:46:24.667

THE SAME CODE MAKING PARITY ON

04:46:28.538 --> 04:46:29.972
EVERYTHING WE'RE NOT CREATING A

04:46:30.039 --> 04:46:32.775
NEW. CRIME WERE NOT. INCREASING

04:46:32.842 --> 04:46:36.012
THE PENALTIES FOR ANY CRIME THE

04:46:36.078 --> 04:46:37.513
CRIME AND THE PENALTIES ARE

04:46:37.580 --> 04:46:39.348
ALREADY IN CODE. WE'RE JUST

04:46:39.415 --> 04:46:41.717
MATCHING. ALL THE OTHER

ITERATIONS OF THE BILL THE

04:46:48.958 --> 04:46:51.327
PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS I

04:46:51.394 --> 04:46:51.894
BELIEVE BECAUSE SOME OF THAT

04:46:51.961 --> 04:46:54.196
CONFUSION. IF I HAVE ANYTHING

04:46:54.263 --> 04:46:54.797

04:47:05.841 --> 04:47:08.945
PENALTIES HOWEVER IT CAN ALSO

SIX MONTHS RATHERTHAN A YEAR

04:47:22.191 --> 04:47:23.926
EITHER WAY IT'S A MISDEMEANOR

04:47:23.993 --> 04:47:26.195
THIS ONE ALLOWS IT FOR UP TO A

04:47:26.262 --> 04:47:29.599
YEAR- UNDER PROP FORTY SEVEN

PARTICULAR THE BILL ALLOWS AN

05:19:39.026 --> 05:19:40.895

05:46:49.255 --> 05:46:54.527
ARE ONLY. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE.

05:46:54.593 --> 05:46:56.128
ONLY FOR WHO ARE TWENTY. AND

05:46:56.195 --> 05:46:56.862
OLDER THE BILL IS NO

05:46:56.929 --> 05:46:58.797
APPLICATION TO ANYONE UNDER THE

05:46:58.864 --> 05:47:01.167
AGE OF TWENTY ONE. AND WE MODEL

05:47:01.233 --> 05:47:02.868
THAT STRUCTURE OVER THE

05:47:02.935 --> 05:47:05.137
APPROACH. TO CANNABIS. SO WHAT

05:47:05.204 --> 05:47:06.539
DO YOU MEAN BY THE CRIMINALIZES

05:47:06.605 --> 05:47:07.973
BEEN SOME QUESTIONS AND PEOPLE

05:47:08.040 --> 05:47:10.242
SOMETIMES HEAR THE WORD. AND

05:47:10.309 --> 05:47:11.076
THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT

05:47:11.143 --> 05:47:12.411
MEANS. WHEN WE SAY THEY

05:47:12.478 --> 05:47:14.146
CRIMINALIZE WHAT WE MEAN IS

05:47:14.213 --> 05:47:16.582
THAT UNDER SB FIVE NINETEEN. WE

05:47:16.649 --> 05:47:18.684
WILL NO LONGER ARREST PEOPLE

05:47:18.751 --> 05:47:21.320
AND INCARCERATE THEM. FOR THE

05:47:21.387 --> 05:47:23.956
SIMPLE PERSONAL POSSESSION. OF

05:47:24.023 --> 05:47:25.891
PSYCHEDELICS FOR PERSONAL. OR

05:47:25.958 --> 05:47:28.260
SHARED USE SO THAT'S REALLY THE

05:47:28.327 --> 05:47:32.231
QUESTION HERE- DO WE BELIEVE.

05:47:32.298 --> 05:47:32.965
THAT WE SHOULD BE ARRESTING

05:47:33.032 --> 05:47:35.334
SOMEONE. BECAUSE THEY POSSESS

05:47:35.401 --> 05:47:38.704
PSYCHEDELICS. FOR PERSONAL USE.

05:47:38.771 --> 05:47:40.406
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD FRANKLY

05:47:40.472 --> 05:47:43.008
I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK

05:47:43.075 --> 05:47:45.010
WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT. THE

05:47:45.077 --> 05:47:46.879
BILL DOES NOT DECRIMINALIZE THE

05:47:46.946 --> 05:47:48.981
SALE OF PSYCHEDELICS THAT WILL

05:47:49.048 --> 05:47:53.385
CONTINUE. TO BE A CRIME. TO

05:47:53.452 --> 05:47:55.454
PROMOTE SAFER USE THE BILL ALSO

05:47:55.521 --> 05:47:57.690
DECRIMINALIZE IS DRUG TESTING

05:47:57.756 --> 05:47:59.592
KITS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN

05:47:59.658 --> 05:48:02.061
ACTUALLY TEST SWAB ANTESTOR

05:48:02.127 --> 05:48:04.196
PSYCHEDELICS TO CONFIRM THAT

05:48:04.263 --> 05:48:06.031
THEY ARE NOT CONTAMINATED THAT

05:48:06.098 --> 05:48:06.799
IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE

05:48:06.865 --> 05:48:08.133
PROMOTING FOR ALL DRUG USE

05:48:08.200 --> 05:48:09.268
PARTICULARLY WITH A FENCE IN A

05:48:09.335 --> 05:48:10.769
LOCKED THEM BACK. IN TERMS OF

05:48:10.836 --> 05:48:12.638
MATH AD HER WHEN THAT'S BEING

05:48:12.705 --> 05:48:14.807
LACED BUT HERE WHERE

05:48:14.873 --> 05:48:17.309
SPECIFICALLY THE CRIMINALIZING

05:48:17.376 --> 05:48:19.678
OF FOR PSYCHEDELICS. SB FIVE

05:48:19.745 --> 05:48:21.013
NINETEEN ALSO CONVENES AN

05:48:21.080 --> 05:48:23.115
EXPERT WORKING GROUP. UNDER THE

05:48:23.182 --> 05:48:25.150
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO

05:48:25.217 --> 05:48:26.385
DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS

05:48:26.452 --> 05:48:27.753
REGARDING POTENTIAL FUTURE

05:48:27.820 --> 05:48:33.792
STRATEGIES. AROUND SAFE USE

05:48:33.859 --> 05:48:35.861
THAT CETERA OF PSYCHEDELICS.

05:48:35.928 --> 05:48:37.263
SINCE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

05:48:37.329 --> 05:48:39.365
MISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS BILL

05:48:39.431 --> 05:48:40.966
AND I SUSPECT YOU WILL HEAR

05:48:41.033 --> 05:48:42.134
SOME OF THAT IN THE PUBLIC

05:48:42.201 --> 05:48:44.270
COMMENT TODAY FRANKLY SOME

05:48:44.336 --> 05:48:46.405
OUTRAGEOUS MISREPRESENTATIONS

05:48:46.472 --> 05:48:48.207
AROUND THE BILL. JUST TO

05:48:48.274 --> 05:48:50.342
CLARIFY THE BILL DOES NOT

05:48:50.409 --> 05:48:51.977
DECRIMINALIZE THE SALE OF

05:48:52.044 --> 05:48:54.480
PSYCHEDELICS. IT DOES NOT

05:48:54.546 --> 05:48:57.416
DECRIMINALIZE. IN ANYWAY GIVING

05:48:57.483 --> 05:48:58.784
OR SHARING OR OTHERWISE

05:48:58.851 --> 05:49:00.119
PROVIDING PSYCHEDELICS TO

05:49:00.185 --> 05:49:01.887
ANYONE UNDER TWENTY ONE. ALL

05:49:01.954 --> 05:49:04.957
THAT WILL REMAIN ILLEGAL. WHAT

05:49:05.024 --> 05:49:07.793
SB FIVE NINETEEN DIES IS ENSURE

05:49:07.860 --> 05:49:10.195
THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS WITHOUT

05:49:10.262 --> 05:49:12.798
BEING A CRIMINAL. TO SUBSTANCES

05:49:12.865 --> 05:49:14.199
THAT ARE LITERALLY FIXING

05:49:14.266 --> 05:49:17.102
PEOPLE'S BRAINS. LITERALLY

05:49:17.169 --> 05:49:18.971
ENDING MENTAL HEALTH AND

05:49:19.038 --> 05:49:22.074
ADDICTION DIAGNOSES NOT ONLY

05:49:22.141 --> 05:49:24.243
IMPROVING CONDITIONS BUT

05:49:24.310 --> 05:49:25.711
ACCORDING THIS RECENT

05:49:25.778 --> 05:49:27.446
SCIENTIFIC STUDIES FOR EXAMPLE

05:49:27.513 --> 05:49:30.182
AROUND MDMA. MAKING IT TO THE

05:49:30.249 --> 05:49:32.685
PEOPLE WITH PTSD NO LONGER HAVE

05:49:32.751 --> 05:49:35.220
A PTSD DIAGNOSIS. BUT SOMEONE

05:49:35.287 --> 05:49:38.057
ADDICTED TO HEROIN IS NO LONGER

05:49:38.123 --> 05:49:38.624
ADDICTED TO HER OR NOT JUST

05:49:38.691 --> 05:49:42.494
IMPROVING. DOT TO BUT SITUATION

05:49:42.561 --> 05:49:44.229
WHERE PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE

05:49:44.296 --> 05:49:46.532
LITERALLY TRANSFORMS BECAUSE OF

05:49:46.598 --> 05:49:49.168
THESE SUBSTANCES. FOR FAR TOO

05:49:49.234 --> 05:49:51.837
LONG THE ONLY REGULATIONS THAT

05:49:51.904 --> 05:49:53.605
WE KIND OF THESE SUBSTANCES IS

05:49:53.672 --> 05:49:55.074
THE SAY IF YOU POSSESS AND USE

05:49:55.140 --> 05:49:57.042
THAT YOU'RE A CRIMINAL AND YOU

05:49:57.109 --> 05:49:58.644
MIGHT GET ARRESTED AND PUT IN

05:49:58.711 --> 05:50:02.748
PRISON. RATHER THAN PROPERLY

05:50:02.815 --> 05:50:04.516
EVEN TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE

05:50:04.583 --> 05:50:05.751
BETWEEN DIFFERENT DRUG

05:50:05.818 --> 05:50:08.754
SUBSTANCES. WE JUST TREAT

05:50:08.821 --> 05:50:14.193
EVERYTHING AS SOMEHOW MORALLY.

05:50:14.259 --> 05:50:15.961
IN GENERAL HAS BEEN A FAILURE

05:50:16.028 --> 05:50:17.129
WE WERE TRYING TO ARREST OUR

05:50:17.196 --> 05:50:18.997
WAY OUT OF DRUG USE AND

05:50:19.064 --> 05:50:20.999
ADDICTION FOR FIFTY YEARS AND

05:50:21.066 --> 05:50:22.534
IT HASN'T IMPROVED ANYTHING

05:50:22.601 --> 05:50:24.136
WHATSOEVER PEOPLE ARE STILL

05:50:24.203 --> 05:50:26.772
USING- PEOPLE ARE STILL GETTING

05:50:26.839 --> 05:50:28.374
ADDICTED NOT TO PSYCHEDELICS

05:50:28.440 --> 05:50:29.775
BECAUSE THESE ARE GENERALLY NOT

05:50:29.842 --> 05:50:32.111
ADDICTIVE BUT OTHER DRUGS. AND

05:50:32.177 --> 05:50:33.212
ALL WE'VE DONE IS FILL UP OUR

05:50:33.278 --> 05:50:35.347
PRISON WITH DRUG CRIMES AND

05:50:35.414 --> 05:50:38.083
WE'RE NOT SAFER AND WE JUST

05:50:38.150 --> 05:50:40.085
SPENT A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY- THE

05:50:40.152 --> 05:50:43.255
FAILED WAR ON DRUGS. HAS BEEN A

05:50:43.322 --> 05:50:46.024
HUGE BURDEN ON TAX REVENUES

05:50:46.091 --> 05:50:48.927
TORN COMMUNITIES APART IT HAS

05:50:48.994 --> 05:50:50.529
DRAMATICALLY HARM BLACK AND

05:50:50.596 --> 05:50:52.998
BROWN COMMUNITIES AND HAS DONE

05:50:53.065 --> 05:50:55.300
NOTHING TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY

05:50:55.367 --> 05:50:58.337
SAFER. OR TO MAKE PEOPLE SAFER

05:50:58.404 --> 05:50:59.938
IF THEY'RE USING DRUGS IN FACT

05:51:00.005 --> 05:51:02.074
IT'S MADE US LESS SAFE BECAUSE

05:51:02.141 --> 05:51:04.376
PEOPLE USE IN THE SHADOWS THEY

05:51:04.443 --> 05:51:06.078
KNOW THAT THEY'RE COMMITTING A

05:51:06.145 --> 05:51:06.879
CRIME AND SO THEY DON'T GET

05:51:06.945 --> 05:51:10.115
INFORMATION. AND EDUCATION.

05:51:10.182 --> 05:51:12.050
THAT COULD LET THEM BE SAFER.

05:51:12.117 --> 05:51:13.352
IT'S TIME THAT WE STOP OUR

05:51:13.419 --> 05:51:15.320
FAILED POLICY OF MASS

05:51:15.387 --> 05:51:17.322
INCARCERATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE.

05:51:17.389 --> 05:51:19.958
THAT NOT EVERY SUBSTANCE IS

05:51:20.025 --> 05:51:22.394
HARMFUL. JUST BECAUSE- A

05:51:22.461 --> 05:51:23.929
HUNDRED OR FIFTY YEARS AGO THE

05:51:23.996 --> 05:51:25.764
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECLARED

05:51:25.831 --> 05:51:27.800
THAT A PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE. IS

05:51:27.866 --> 05:51:32.671
SOMEHOW BAD AND THUS ILLEGAL.

05:51:32.738 --> 05:51:35.274
THE SUBSTANCES IN THIS BILL

05:51:35.340 --> 05:51:37.810
HAVE BEEN FOUND NOT JUST BY

05:51:37.876 --> 05:51:39.545
POLITICIANS OR ADVOCATES BY

05:51:39.611 --> 05:51:41.880
SCIENTISTS BY SCIENTIFIC

05:51:41.947 --> 05:51:43.882
STUDIES INCLUDING AND IN NEW

05:51:43.949 --> 05:51:46.652
ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE

05:51:46.718 --> 05:51:48.387
STUDIES AFFILIATED WITH THE FTA.

05:51:48.454 --> 05:51:50.022
BUT A MYRIAD OF MENTAL HEALTH

05:51:50.088 --> 05:51:53.025
ISSUES INCLUDING ANXIETY

05:51:53.091 --> 05:51:55.160
ADDICTION DEPRESSION INSOMNIA

05:51:55.227 --> 05:51:58.964
EATING DISORDERS PTSD SMOKING.

05:51:59.031 --> 05:52:03.302
CAN BE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVES

05:52:03.368 --> 05:52:05.971
WITH PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY.

05:52:06.038 --> 05:52:07.739
VETERANS AND MANY OF YOU ARE

05:52:07.806 --> 05:52:10.108
PROBABLY I HOPE MATTER HEARD

05:52:10.175 --> 05:52:11.143
FROM OUR VETERANS ARE

05:52:11.210 --> 05:52:13.612
SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OR TO

05:52:13.679 --> 05:52:14.780
ORGANIZATIONS OF COMBAT

05:52:14.847 --> 05:52:16.281
VETERANS WHO WORK WITH VETERANS

05:52:16.348 --> 05:52:18.116
WHO HAVE GONE TO WAR FOR OUR

05:52:18.183 --> 05:52:21.019
COUNTRY AND BEEN HARMED AS A

05:52:21.086 --> 05:52:23.055
RESULT AND COME BACK WITH PTSD

05:52:23.121 --> 05:52:24.957
WITH SEVERE DEPRESSION WITH

05:52:25.023 --> 05:52:28.126
OTHER. DISORDERS AND YOU

05:52:28.193 --> 05:52:28.760
TREATMENT TRADITIONAL TREATMENT

05:52:28.827 --> 05:52:30.662
HASN'T WORKED. AND PSYCHEDELIC

05:52:30.729 --> 05:52:32.664
THERAPY HAS ALLOWED THEM TO GET

05:52:32.731 --> 05:52:34.166
THEIR LIVES BACK AND YET WE

05:52:34.233 --> 05:52:36.068
FORCED THEM TO GO TO PERU OR

05:52:36.134 --> 05:52:38.303
MEXICO OR TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

05:52:38.370 --> 05:52:39.371
TO GET THIS TREATMENT AFTER

05:52:39.438 --> 05:52:41.507
THEY FOUGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY

05:52:41.573 --> 05:52:44.076
BECAUSE WE MADE IT ILLEGAL HERE.

05:52:44.142 --> 05:52:44.710
EIGHTEEN VETERANS COMMIT

05:52:44.776 --> 05:52:46.345
SUICIDE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN

05:52:46.411 --> 05:52:48.247
THIS COUNTRY EIGHTEEN EVERYDAY

05:52:48.313 --> 05:52:50.148
COMMENSURATE SIDE. WE HAVE AN

05:52:50.215 --> 05:52:52.117
OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM AMONG

05:52:52.184 --> 05:52:53.752
OTHER NOT JUST VETERANS AMONG

05:52:53.819 --> 05:52:56.121
OTHERS. ACTUALLY TURN THEIR

05:52:56.188 --> 05:53:00.726
LIVES AROUND. THESE IMPACTS

05:53:00.792 --> 05:53:01.260
HAVE BEEN FOUND BOTH IN A

05:53:01.326 --> 05:53:04.096
CLINICAL SETTING. IT ALSO IN

05:53:04.162 --> 05:53:06.265
NON CLINICAL SETTINGS AND IT'S

05:53:06.331 --> 05:53:07.533
TIME WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE

05:53:07.599 --> 05:53:10.068
BENEFITS OF THESE SUBSTANCES

05:53:10.135 --> 05:53:10.602
EVEN OUTSIDE OF A CLINICAL

05:53:10.669 --> 05:53:17.276
SETTING. I WANT TO BE CLEAR I

05:53:17.342 --> 05:53:19.011
SAID THIS EARLIER THAT

05:53:19.077 --> 05:53:20.779
PSYCHEDELICS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY

05:53:20.846 --> 05:53:23.749
NOT A DETECTIVE. AND PEOPLE CAN

05:53:23.815 --> 05:53:26.184
USE THEM SAFELY. BUT IT'S

05:53:26.251 --> 05:53:29.254
HARDER TO USE THEM SAFELY IF

05:53:29.321 --> 05:53:29.821
PEOPLE ARE CRIMINALIZED FOR

05:53:29.888 --> 05:53:32.991
DOING SO. BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE

05:53:33.058 --> 05:53:35.093
SEEN THAT LAST NOVEMBER OREGON

05:53:35.160 --> 05:53:38.163
VOTERS. VOTED TO DECRIMINALIZE

05:53:38.230 --> 05:53:39.932
NOT TO PSYCHEDELICS BUT

05:53:39.998 --> 05:53:42.000
POSSESSION OF ALL DRUGS. EVERY

05:53:42.067 --> 05:53:44.970
SINGLE ONE OF THEM. THE MAIN

05:53:45.037 --> 05:53:46.138
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

05:53:46.204 --> 05:53:47.005
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE THINK WE

05:53:47.072 --> 05:53:48.106
HAVE TO GO TO THE VOTERS FOR

05:53:48.173 --> 05:53:49.408
THESE THINGS THE MAIN HOUSE OF

05:53:49.474 --> 05:53:51.376
REPRESENTATIVES JUST VOTED TO

05:53:51.443 --> 05:53:53.445
DECRIMINALIZE THE POSSESSION OF

05:53:53.512 --> 05:53:55.514
ALL DRUGS A WEEK OR TWO AGO.

05:53:55.581 --> 05:53:56.848
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING EVEN

05:53:56.915 --> 05:53:58.850
THOUGH I SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS

05:53:58.917 --> 05:54:00.052
AND I HOPE CALIFORNIA GETS

05:54:00.118 --> 05:54:01.887
THERE IN THIS BILL WE'RE

05:54:01.954 --> 05:54:03.755
PROPOSING A MUCH NARROWER

05:54:03.822 --> 05:54:07.659
SUBSET. OF THOSE STOPS. WE KNOW

05:54:07.726 --> 05:54:09.695
THE PORTUGAL DECRIMINALIZED

05:54:09.761 --> 05:54:11.430
POSSESSION. AND WHAT TYPE THERE

05:54:11.496 --> 05:54:13.599
ARE ALL SORTS OF GLOOM AND DOOM

05:54:13.665 --> 05:54:14.199
PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT WOULD

05:54:14.266 --> 05:54:15.834
HAPPEN IN PORTUGAL. WHAT

05:54:15.901 --> 05:54:18.103
HAPPENED IN PORTUGAL. OVERDOSE

05:54:18.170 --> 05:54:20.806
DEATHS. WENT DOWN HIV

05:54:20.872 --> 05:54:22.407
INFECTIONS WENT DOWN

05:54:22.474 --> 05:54:25.043
SIGNIFICANTLY. BECAUSE THEY

05:54:25.110 --> 05:54:26.345
STARTED TO TREAT DRUGS AS WHAT

05:54:26.411 --> 05:54:28.313
IT IS IT'S A HEALTH ISSUE NOT A

05:54:28.380 --> 05:54:30.549
CRIMINAL ISSUE. I KNOW THAT

05:54:30.616 --> 05:54:32.517
THERE IS A LOT OF FEAR THAT

05:54:32.584 --> 05:54:32.918
COULD SPREAD ABOUT

05:54:32.985 --> 05:54:35.320
PSYCHEDELICS. PEOPLE YOU KNOW

05:54:35.387 --> 05:54:36.722
GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN SIXTIES

05:54:36.788 --> 05:54:38.256
IT'S LIKE THE PSYCHEDELIC

05:54:38.323 --> 05:54:39.758
EQUIVALENT OF REEFER MADNESS

05:54:39.825 --> 05:54:41.727
THAT THIS IS GONNA LIKE DO ALL

05:54:41.793 --> 05:54:43.929
SORTS OF HORRIBLE THINGS. AND

05:54:43.996 --> 05:54:45.897
THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE ANY

05:54:45.964 --> 05:54:48.100
SUBSTANCE CAN BE MISUSED. I

05:54:48.166 --> 05:54:49.935
COULD GO HOME TONIGHT AND TAKE

05:54:50.002 --> 05:54:52.070
TOO MANY SLEEPING PILLS. AND

05:54:52.137 --> 05:54:54.439
HARM MYSELF YOU COULD TAKE TOO

05:54:54.506 --> 05:54:56.675
MUCH COUGH SYRUP. AND HARM

05:54:56.742 --> 05:54:58.577

05:54:58.644 --> 05:55:00.779
TYLENOL AND HARMS OF ANY

05:55:00.846 --> 05:55:02.681
SUBSTANCE IN THE WORLD CAN BE

05:55:02.748 --> 05:55:04.850
MISUSED AND THAT'S WHY I WANT

05:55:04.916 --> 05:55:06.385
TO GET PEOPLE HELPING EDUCATION

05:55:06.451 --> 05:55:07.986
INSTEAD OF ARRESTING THEM. BUT

05:55:08.053 --> 05:55:08.887
WE NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT

05:55:08.954 --> 05:55:10.589
PROHIBITION DOESN'T WORK IT

05:55:10.656 --> 05:55:12.357

06:09:47.665 --> 06:09:50.234
THE- PROBLEM WITH THE CHALLENGE

06:09:56.107 --> 06:09:58.509

SHE WOUND UP BEING HOSPITALIZED

06:10:10.855 --> 06:10:13.858
AND RAN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

06:10:13.925 --> 06:10:16.394
SHE HAD FLASHBACKS. YEAH BEFORE

CRIMINALIZED EVERYTHING. AND SO

06:29:19.102 --> 06:29:20.603
DIE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE WAR ON

06:29:20.670 --> 06:29:21.371
DRUGS THAT WERE IN THIS

06:29:21.438 --> 06:29:23.139
SITUATION THAT PEOPLE DON'T

06:29:23.206 --> 06:29:24.441
HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED

06:29:24.507 --> 06:29:25.542
THE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY NEED

06:29:25.608 --> 06:29:27.177
TO USE IT AND THE SHADOWS.

06:29:27.243 --> 06:29:28.845
WHICH MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT

06:29:28.912 --> 06:29:29.779
PEOPLE MIGHT USE IT IN THE

06:29:29.846 --> 06:29:31.347
WRONG DOSAGE WERE IN THE WRONG

06:29:31.414 --> 06:29:33.083
WAY I WANT TO BE CLEAR. I WOULD

06:29:33.149 --> 06:29:35.952
LOVE IT IF THE FDA ACTUALLY GOT

06:29:36.019 --> 06:29:38.154
AROUND TO RESCHEDULING-

06:29:38.221 --> 06:29:40.690
DISSIPATE. CALAMY HAS BEEN

06:29:40.757 --> 06:29:42.192
RESCHEDULED ONE OF THE REASON

06:29:42.258 --> 06:29:43.293
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WERE

06:29:43.359 --> 06:29:45.495
OPEN BUT I DON'T WANT TO. BUT I

06:29:45.562 --> 06:29:46.796
HEARD PEOPLE WERE SAYING ONE OF

06:29:46.863 --> 06:29:48.264
THE REASONS WE TOOK IT OUT. IS

06:29:48.331 --> 06:29:48.998
THAT IF YOU HAVE SEVERE

06:29:49.065 --> 06:29:50.600
DEPRESSION AND KELEMETE IS

06:29:50.667 --> 06:29:52.102
ARGUABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST

06:29:52.168 --> 06:29:53.436
BREAKTHROUGHS IN DEPRESSION

06:29:53.503 --> 06:29:55.205
TREATMENT IN A HUNDRED YEARS.

06:29:55.271 --> 06:29:56.740
YOU CAN GO TO A DOCTOR AND

06:29:56.806 --> 06:29:58.241
GETTING A FUSION ACADEMY YOU

06:29:58.308 --> 06:29:59.342
CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT NOW WITH

06:29:59.409 --> 06:30:01.111
ANY OF THESE OTHER DRUGS. IT

06:30:01.177 --> 06:30:02.579
WOULD A DOCTOR WILL LOSE HIS

06:30:02.645 --> 06:30:05.315
LICENSE. IF YOU'RE SHE TRIES TO

06:30:05.381 --> 06:30:07.317
GET THIS YEAR. AND SO I WANT

06:30:07.383 --> 06:30:09.519
THE FDA TO DO IT. I DON'T KNOW

06:30:09.586 --> 06:30:11.020
IF THE FTA WILL EVER GET AROUND

06:30:11.087 --> 06:30:12.355
TO IT OR IF IT'S GOING TO BE IN

06:30:12.422 --> 06:30:13.456
THREE OR FIVE OR SEVEN OR TEN

06:30:13.523 --> 06:30:14.991
YEARS. BUT WHAT I DO KNOW IS

06:30:15.058 --> 06:30:16.993
THAT PEOPLE ARE HURTING AND

06:30:17.060 --> 06:30:19.796
DYING NOW- I THINK WHEN YOU

06:30:19.863 --> 06:30:20.797
LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF VETERANS

06:30:20.864 --> 06:30:22.432
WHO ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE

06:30:22.499 --> 06:30:25.602
BECAUSE OF UNTREATED. MENTAL

06:30:25.668 --> 06:30:27.003
HEALTH ISSUES. I MORE TO. A I'M

06:30:27.070 --> 06:30:29.272
GOING TO BE MY LIFE. THE THAT.

06:30:29.339 --> 06:30:30.006
ANYONE WHO'S COMMITTING

06:30:30.073 --> 06:30:32.108
SUICIDE. BECAUSE THEY TOOK A

06:30:32.175 --> 06:30:33.042
PSYCHEDELIC THAT IS NOT AN

06:30:33.109 --> 06:30:34.944
EPIDEMIC. THE EPIDEMIC IS

06:30:35.011 --> 06:30:35.879
UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH AND

06:30:35.945 --> 06:30:37.847
ADDICTION. LIKE THE SEVEN

06:30:37.914 --> 06:30:39.182
HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO DIED LAST

06:30:39.249 --> 06:30:41.017
YEAR IN MY COMMUNITY IN SAN

06:30:41.084 --> 06:30:43.019
FRANCISCO. OF OVERDOSES.

06:30:43.086 --> 06:30:44.220
BECAUSE THEY'RE ADDICTED TO

06:30:44.287 --> 06:30:46.756
HEROIN OR FENTANYL. OUR BATH

06:30:46.823 --> 06:30:48.158
AND IT'S ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO

06:30:48.224 --> 06:30:50.527
ACCESS. THIS TREATMENT SO I

06:30:50.593 --> 06:30:52.362
HOPE THE FTA GETS AROUND TO IT.

06:30:52.428 --> 06:30:54.097
BUT YOU KNOW. IN MY COMMUNITY

06:30:54.164 --> 06:30:55.532
WERE ALSO LOSING THOUSANDS OF

06:30:55.598 --> 06:30:57.167
PEOPLE IN THE NINETEEN

06:30:57.233 --> 06:30:59.269
EIGHTIES. FROM AIDS. AND IT WAS

06:30:59.335 --> 06:31:01.237
A LEGAL TO USE CANNABIS EVEN

06:31:01.304 --> 06:31:01.938
THOUGH CANNABIS COULD KEEP

06:31:02.005 --> 06:31:04.007
PEOPLE HEALTHIER. AND ALLEVIATE

06:31:04.073 --> 06:31:05.842
THEIR SYMPTOMS. AND EVEN TODAY

06:31:05.909 --> 06:31:07.310
THE NUMBER OF SENIOR CITIZENS

06:31:07.377 --> 06:31:08.845
WHO ARE USING CANNABIS. FOR

06:31:08.912 --> 06:31:11.414
THEIR ARTHRITIS. CONSERVATIVE

06:31:11.481 --> 06:31:13.316
REPUBLICANS SENIORS. WHO ARE

06:31:13.383 --> 06:31:14.317
USING CANNABIS FOR THEIR

06:31:14.384 --> 06:31:16.386
ARTHRITIS. AND THE FDA HAS

06:31:16.452 --> 06:31:18.021
NEVER RESCHEDULED OF DOCTORS

06:31:18.087 --> 06:31:19.856
CAN LOSE THEIR LICENSE. IF THEY

06:31:19.923 --> 06:31:22.125
PRESCRIBE. SO I WANT THEM TO DO

06:31:22.192 --> 06:31:23.092
THAT BUT I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE

06:31:23.159 --> 06:31:27.197
HURTING NOW- AND I WANT TO HELP

06:31:27.263 --> 06:31:28.565
THEM UNDERSTAND THAT AND- A. D.

06:31:28.631 --> 06:31:30.366
TELL ME. I WANT TO THANK YOU

06:31:30.433 --> 06:31:31.467
FOR TAKING THAT OFF THE LIST

06:31:31.534 --> 06:31:33.503
CAN MEANS DATE RAPE. THAT'S WHY

06:31:33.570 --> 06:31:35.772
THAT IS I JUST DON'T WITH A

06:31:35.839 --> 06:31:38.575
CONSTITUENT. WHO IS IN THE SAD

06:31:38.641 --> 06:31:39.175
CIRCUMSTANCE OF HAVING THAT

06:31:39.242 --> 06:31:40.977
HAPPEN TO THEM. AND THEY

06:31:41.044 --> 06:31:41.945
COULDN'T GET THE HOSPITAL TO

06:31:42.011 --> 06:31:44.480
GIVEN THE TEST IT'LL LET THEM

06:31:44.547 --> 06:31:46.416
KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED-

06:31:46.482 --> 06:31:48.384
SO TERRY. THANK YOU FOR TAKING

06:31:48.451 --> 06:31:49.786
THAT OFF THE LIST BECAUSE I WAS

06:31:49.853 --> 06:31:51.354
REALLY THAT WAS A REAL RALLY

06:31:51.421 --> 06:31:52.288
KILLER WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT

06:31:52.355 --> 06:31:53.957
THIS. AS IF THERE WEREN'T

06:31:54.023 --> 06:31:57.427
ENOUGH OF THE OTHER ONES- WHEN

06:31:57.493 --> 06:31:59.629
I TALKED THE HIGHWAY PATROL.

06:31:59.696 --> 06:32:02.332
YOU KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER IS OF

06:32:02.398 --> 06:32:04.734
HIGHWAY. INCIDENTS ARE ON THE

06:32:04.801 --> 06:32:08.571
HIGHWAYS RIGHT NOW. 70% OF THE

06:32:08.638 --> 06:32:09.205
PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN AN

06:32:09.272 --> 06:32:10.740
INCIDENT ON THE HIGHWAY ARE

06:32:10.807 --> 06:32:12.308
UNDER SOME KIND OF INFLUENCE OF

06:32:12.375 --> 06:32:15.545
SOME KIND OF DRUG. AND SO I

06:32:15.612 --> 06:32:16.246
DON'T SEE HOW THIS HELPS THAT

06:32:16.312 --> 06:32:18.948
OUT ANY. AND ALSO UNDER DON'T

06:32:19.015 --> 06:32:20.316
UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE GOING TO

06:32:20.383 --> 06:32:23.086
KEEP THESE. OUT OF THE HANDS OF

06:32:23.152 --> 06:32:24.220
OUR UNDER TWENTY ONE

06:32:24.287 --> 06:32:25.922
POPULATION. BECAUSE THIS WILL

06:32:25.989 --> 06:32:27.523
BE JUST LIKE BEER YOU JUST GO

06:32:27.590 --> 06:32:28.858
GET THE TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD TO

06:32:28.925 --> 06:32:30.526
GIVE YOU THE STUFF. AND EVEN

06:32:30.593 --> 06:32:31.694
THOUGH IT'S ILLEGAL THEY'RE

06:32:31.761 --> 06:32:32.629
STILL GOING TO GET IT THEY'RE

06:32:32.695 --> 06:32:34.063
GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO IT

06:32:34.130 --> 06:32:35.064
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A

06:32:35.131 --> 06:32:36.799
MARKET FOR IT. SO THAT THE

06:32:36.866 --> 06:32:38.568
ILLEGAL DRUG TRADE WILL BE ABLE

06:32:38.635 --> 06:32:40.270
TO SUPPLY THEM. ALL THESE

06:32:40.336 --> 06:32:41.604
PEOPLE THAT WANT THIS BECAUSE

06:32:41.671 --> 06:32:43.740
THEY'RE NOT ALL WITH PTSD

06:32:43.806 --> 06:32:44.440
SOMEONE JUST WANT FOR

06:32:44.507 --> 06:32:46.910
RECREATIONAL USE THERE WAS A

06:32:46.976 --> 06:32:48.211
LOT OF THAT IN THE SIXTIES. AND

06:32:48.278 --> 06:32:50.546
SO I I'M NOT SURE HOW WE'RE

06:32:50.613 --> 06:32:52.382
GOING TO CONTROL ALL OF THAT.

06:32:52.448 --> 06:32:55.051
AND ON TOP OF THAT. KEEP OUR

06:32:55.118 --> 06:32:56.886
YOUNG KIDS FROM TAKING OUT ONE

06:32:56.953 --> 06:32:58.922
PILL OF ECSTASY. IT JUST

06:32:58.988 --> 06:32:59.923
HAPPENS TO BE LACED WITH

06:32:59.989 --> 06:33:01.824
FENTANYL. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

06:33:01.891 --> 06:33:02.892
THOSE DRUG DEALERS ARE DOING

06:33:02.959 --> 06:33:04.294
THESE DAYS. IS A RELAXING

06:33:04.360 --> 06:33:05.628
EVERYTHING WITH IT AND ALL

06:33:05.695 --> 06:33:07.196
BECAUSE THEY WANT THEIR DRUG.

06:33:07.263 --> 06:33:08.898
TO HAVE AN EXTRA KICK SO THE

06:33:08.965 --> 06:33:10.934
PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BUY. SO I

06:33:11.000 --> 06:33:12.669
THINK THIS IS. ONE OF THOSE

06:33:12.735 --> 06:33:13.670
THINGS WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING THE

06:33:13.736 --> 06:33:15.305
CART BEFORE THE HORSE. I THINK

06:33:15.371 --> 06:33:17.340
IF THE FDA FINDS THAT THIS IS A

06:33:17.407 --> 06:33:19.275
DRUG. THAT IS ARE THESE DRUGS

06:33:19.342 --> 06:33:20.610
ARE BENEFICIAL FOR A CERTAIN

06:33:20.677 --> 06:33:22.679
POPULATION. THEN I THINK THAT

06:33:22.745 --> 06:33:24.180
NEEDS TO BE REGULATED. ON

06:33:24.247 --> 06:33:26.950
REGULATING IT IS NOT GOING TO

06:33:27.016 --> 06:33:28.518
SOLVE THE PROBLEM. J. THAT YOU

06:33:28.584 --> 06:33:30.153
BROUGHT THE BILL- THOSE ARE MY

06:33:30.219 --> 06:33:31.521
CONCERNS I. APPRECIATE SOME

06:33:31.587 --> 06:33:33.589
EVENT I SAY ALL OF THE BAD

06:33:33.656 --> 06:33:35.558
THINGS HE'S A SAID I AGREE.

06:33:35.625 --> 06:33:36.960
DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE IS

06:33:37.026 --> 06:33:38.995
BAD. GIVING DRUGS TO KIDS IS

06:33:39.062 --> 06:33:41.798
BAD. THAT IT IS ALL HAPPENING

06:33:41.864 --> 06:33:44.834
NOW. AND THAT IS IN THIS BILL

06:33:44.901 --> 06:33:46.970
DOESN'T CHANGE THAT. BUT THAT

06:33:47.036 --> 06:33:47.904
IS ALL HAPPENING NOW AND THE

06:33:47.971 --> 06:33:49.439
QUESTION IS. IF WE'RE GOING TO

06:33:49.505 --> 06:33:50.740
CONTINUE TO SAY THAT ARRESTING

06:33:50.807 --> 06:33:51.941
PEOPLE IS GOING TO PREVENT THAT

06:33:52.008 --> 06:33:53.609
CLEARLY IT DOESN'T. COST FIFTY

06:33:53.676 --> 06:33:54.744
YEARS LATER IT'S ALL STILL

06:33:54.811 --> 06:33:56.379
HAPPENING. AND I DO JUST WANT

06:33:56.446 --> 06:33:57.680
TO SAY YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO

06:33:57.747 --> 06:34:00.049
LOST MY AUNT TO A DRUNK DRIVER-

06:34:00.116 --> 06:34:02.385
I YOU KNOW I IF WE GOT THE DATA

06:34:02.452 --> 06:34:04.287
FROM CHP IN TERMS OF WHAT.

06:34:04.354 --> 06:34:06.289
THEY'RE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF-

06:34:06.356 --> 06:34:07.824
I'VE LEARNED ABOUT MY LUNCH

06:34:07.890 --> 06:34:09.625
AGAIN THAT IS OVERWHELMINGLY.

06:34:09.692 --> 06:34:13.863
ALCOHOL AL CAPONE OR WANNA

06:34:13.930 --> 06:34:15.064
ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOL WHICH BY

06:34:15.131 --> 06:34:16.799
THE WAY. AND WANT TO TALK ABOUT

06:34:16.866 --> 06:34:18.935
A DATE RAPE DRUG. IT'S NOT

06:34:19.002 --> 06:34:21.371
PSYCHEDELICS IS NOT CAN I MEAN.

06:34:21.437 --> 06:34:25.842

THANK AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS

06:34:28.311 --> 06:34:29.979
BILL FORWARD. I THINK IT'S A

06:34:30.046 --> 06:34:31.447
VERY CRITICAL CONVERSATION WE

06:34:31.514 --> 06:34:33.616
NEED TO DECRIMINALIZE-

06:34:33.683 --> 06:34:35.385
POSSESSION OF THESE SUBSTANCES

06:34:35.451 --> 06:34:37.854
FOR PERSONAL USE- I DO BELIEVE

06:34:37.920 --> 06:34:39.756
THAT THEY- CAN OFFER

06:34:39.822 --> 06:34:42.558
THERAPEUTIC VALUE FOR PEOPLE- I

06:34:42.625 --> 06:34:43.860
AGREE WITH YOUR COMMENTS A

HUNDRED PERCENT- YOU KNOW- WE

FREELY DRINK ALCOHOL AND ONE

06:34:49.432 --> 06:34:50.466
COULD SAY THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY

06:34:50.533 --> 06:34:52.235
A MUCH MORE SUBSTANCE. THAN THE

06:34:52.301 --> 06:34:53.136
SUBSTANCES WERE TALKING ABOUT

06:34:53.202 --> 06:34:55.505
HERE- IN THIS BILL AND THE

06:34:55.571 --> 06:34:56.506
OTHER PIECE OF THE EQUATION

06:34:56.572 --> 06:34:57.607
HERE IS THAT WHO'S ACTUALLY

06:34:57.673 --> 06:34:59.175
GETTING ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION

06:34:59.242 --> 06:35:00.610
IT'S KIDS OF COLOR AND PEOPLE

06:35:00.676 --> 06:35:02.378
OF COLOR MORE SO THAN. WHITE

06:35:02.445 --> 06:35:04.047
FAMILIES AND WHITE KIDS AND

06:35:04.113 --> 06:35:05.014
FOLKS WHO ARE USING THIS WE

06:35:05.081 --> 06:35:06.049
HAVE TO HAVE A REAL

06:35:06.115 --> 06:35:07.083
CONVERSATION ABOUT ABOUT THIS

06:35:07.150 --> 06:35:08.885
WAR ON DRUGS. AND WHAT IT

06:35:08.951 --> 06:35:09.952
ACTUALLY MEANS AND ITS IMPACT

06:35:10.019 --> 06:35:12.588
ON PEOPLE'S LIVES- SO I WILL

06:35:12.655 --> 06:35:13.990
MOVE THE BILL HASN'T MOVED

06:35:26.169 --> 06:35:27.937
THAT YOUR- YOUR INTENTIONS. ARE

06:35:28.004 --> 06:35:31.040
SURPRISINGLY NORMAL- BUT I

06:35:31.107 --> 06:35:34.944
REALLY REALLY. TAKEN OBJECTION.

06:35:35.011 --> 06:35:35.545
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THE HURTFUL

06:35:35.611 --> 06:35:37.747

MAYBE EVEN OTHERS AND I THINK

06:35:47.790 --> 06:35:50.860
BY- LEGALIZING THE SUBSTANCE

06:35:50.927 --> 06:35:52.428
THOSE TRAGEDIES ARE GOING TO

06:35:52.495 --> 06:35:53.863

06:36:03.439 --> 06:36:05.341
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THE OTHER

06:36:05.408 --> 06:36:07.276

WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED FIRST

06:39:15.598 --> 06:39:17.533
CONCEPTUALLY BY GOVERNOR BROWN

06:39:17.600 --> 06:39:18.734
BUT THEN THE APPOINTMENTS WERE

06:39:18.801 --> 06:39:20.703
MADE BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND I

06:39:20.770 --> 06:39:22.805

JUDGES- AND- THE ACADEMIC FROM

06:39:32.214 --> 06:39:35.518
STANFORD. WHO FOCUSES ON

06:39:35.584 --> 06:39:37.687
CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND WHAT WE

06:39:37.753 --> 06:39:40.556
HAVE BEEN DOING IS TAKE HAVING

06:39:40.623 --> 06:39:42.725
X. VERY LONG MEETINGS WITH

06:39:42.792 --> 06:39:45.795
STAKEHOLDER INPUT ABOUT VARIOUS

06:39:45.861 --> 06:39:47.563
PARTS OF THE PENAL CODE. AND

06:39:47.630 --> 06:39:49.131
WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF SESSIONS

06:39:49.198 --> 06:39:51.167
ON THE CONCEPT OF ENHANCEMENTS.

06:39:51.233 --> 06:39:52.535
AND AS YOU KNOW WHAT AN

06:39:52.601 --> 06:39:54.203
ENHANCEMENT IS A SENSE IN HANTS

06:39:54.270 --> 06:39:56.505
MEANT IS THAT IT ADDS TIME TO

06:39:56.572 --> 06:39:58.541
THE BASE SENTENCE OF THE FACE

06:39:58.607 --> 06:40:01.210
CRIME. AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH

06:40:01.277 --> 06:40:02.178
MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS

06:40:02.244 --> 06:40:04.046
CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED

06:40:04.113 --> 06:40:06.282
AND SIXTY ON THE BOOKS- MY

06:40:06.349 --> 06:40:08.718
APPROACH WITH SB EIGHTY ONE

06:40:08.784 --> 06:40:10.820
WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY. THE

06:40:10.886 --> 06:40:12.988
JUDGE AND THE JUSTICE ON OUR

06:40:13.055 --> 06:40:15.391
PENAL CODE COMMITTEE. WAS TO

06:40:15.458 --> 06:40:18.361
PROVIDE JUDICIAL GUIDANCE

06:40:18.427 --> 06:40:19.895
BECAUSE BOTH OF THESE- PEOPLE

06:40:19.962 --> 06:40:22.131
THAT SERVE ON THE BENCH.

06:40:22.198 --> 06:40:24.300
POINTED OUT THAT WHILE THERE IS

06:40:24.367 --> 06:40:26.602
SOME DISCRETION IT THEY ARE

06:40:26.669 --> 06:40:29.338
VERY IT'S UNCLEAR UNDER WHAT

06:40:29.405 --> 06:40:32.007
CONTEXT MAY DAY EXERT THAT

06:40:32.074 --> 06:40:34.276
DISCRETION IN RELATIONSHIP TO

06:40:34.343 --> 06:40:36.545
THE SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS AND

06:40:36.612 --> 06:40:38.614
WE EVEN HAD DE ACE TESTIFIED

06:40:38.681 --> 06:40:40.182
THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE TRIAL

06:40:40.249 --> 06:40:42.184
ENDS UP BEING A DISCUSSION ON

06:40:42.251 --> 06:40:44.220
THE ENHANCEMENTS RATHER THAN ON

06:40:44.286 --> 06:40:47.857
THE CRIME ITSELF. SO WHAT SB

06:40:47.923 --> 06:40:49.392
EIGHTY ONE DOES IS PROVIDES

06:40:49.458 --> 06:40:52.895
GUIDANCE TO OUR JUDGES SO THEY

06:40:52.962 --> 06:40:56.332
HAVE SOME CRITERIA TO USE WHEN

06:40:56.399 --> 06:40:58.300
THEY ARE DETERMINING AT THE

06:40:58.367 --> 06:41:01.337
SENTENCING HANDSOMEST AT THE AT.

06:41:01.404 --> 06:41:02.238
SO IT PROVIDES THIS CLEAR

06:41:02.304 --> 06:41:05.808
GUIDANCE AND- THE COMMITTEE AND

06:41:05.875 --> 06:41:08.377
I FEEL THAT THIS WILL IMPROVE

06:41:08.444 --> 06:41:10.579
FAIRNESS IN SENTENCING AND

06:41:10.646 --> 06:41:11.714
ENSURE THAT THE PENALTY

06:41:11.781 --> 06:41:13.716
REFLECTS THE TRUE CIRCUMSTANCES

06:41:13.783 --> 06:41:17.286
OF THE CRIME- I WOULD LIKE MY

06:41:17.353 --> 06:41:20.356

DID MANAGE PENAL CODE- THIRTEEN

06:43:03.826 --> 06:43:05.528
EIGHTY FIVE. WHICH ALLOWS

PARTICULAR PROPOSAL TO YOU

07:04:44.225 --> 07:04:45.960
BROUGHT FORWARD HERE I THINK IT

07:04:46.027 --> 07:04:48.496
GOES WAY BEYOND GUIDANCE AND

07:04:48.563 --> 07:04:50.731
IT'S MY OPINION THAT IT'S

07:04:50.798 --> 07:04:52.667
EXTREMELY BIASED. AND IT'S

07:04:52.733 --> 07:04:54.535
APPROACH AND- YOU MENTIONED

07:04:54.602 --> 07:04:56.637
EARLIER THIS TO YOUR GOAL WAS

07:04:56.704 --> 07:04:59.240
FAIRNESS. BUT IN MY OPINION OF

07:04:59.307 --> 07:05:01.809
FAIRNESS SHOULD NOT BE DEFINED

07:05:01.876 --> 07:05:03.344
BY JUST A REDUCED SENTENCE. I

07:05:03.411 --> 07:05:07.982
HAVE HERE. A BOOK THIS BOOK IS

07:05:08.049 --> 07:05:10.017
SOLELY CRIMINAL SENTENCING

07:05:10.084 --> 07:05:12.486
ENHANCEMENTS AND YOU YOUR BILL

07:05:12.553 --> 07:05:14.689
WILL ESSENTIALLY MAKE ITS

07:05:14.755 --> 07:05:17.959
CONTENTS OBSOLETE. BECAUSE YOU

07:05:18.025 --> 07:05:20.094
YOUR BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM.

07:05:20.161 --> 07:05:22.330
DESTROYS JUDICIAL DISCRETION AS

07:05:22.396 --> 07:05:24.665
IT RELATES TO- SENATE'S

07:05:24.732 --> 07:05:27.835
ANNOUNCEMENTS. AND SO I WILL

07:05:27.902 --> 07:05:30.771
NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. AND

07:05:30.838 --> 07:05:33.741
I'D I'M SORRY THAT- THAT'S MY

07:05:33.808 --> 07:05:34.275

07:05:34.342 --> 07:05:37.411

NOW CENTER COLLAR ON IT BUT IT

07:05:49.190 --> 07:05:50.191
IS REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK

07:05:50.258 --> 07:05:51.092
WITH SUPPORT AT THIS BILL I

07:05:51.158 --> 07:05:52.426
THINK IT'S MISCONSTRUED AS THE

07:05:52.493 --> 07:05:55.897
IT'S CLARIFYING. OF THE ABILITY

07:05:55.963 --> 07:05:57.965
TO FOURTEEN JUSTICES TO DISMISS

07:05:58.032 --> 07:05:58.966
ENHANCEMENT IN THE FURTHERANCE

07:05:59.033 --> 07:05:59.934
OF JUSTICE AND THAT'S THE KEY

07:06:00.001 --> 07:06:01.102
PHRASE IN THE FURTHERANCE OF

07:06:01.168 --> 07:06:03.204
JUSTICE IF THAT PHRASE SOUNDS

07:06:03.271 --> 07:06:04.772
VAGUE TO YOU RIGHT NOW THAT OF

07:06:04.839 --> 07:06:05.940
COURSE IMAGINE IT AT THE COURT

07:06:06.007 --> 07:06:07.241
LEVEL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

07:06:07.308 --> 07:06:08.876
TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL AND

07:06:08.943 --> 07:06:10.311
I SEE IT'S ALSO PERSPECTIVE SO

07:06:10.378 --> 07:06:11.812
DOESN'T YOU RETRACTABLE THAT

07:06:11.879 --> 07:06:15.483
PEOPLE- SOME OF THE- OPPONENTS.

07:06:15.549 --> 07:06:16.817
KIND OF. MESSAGE ABOUT. I THINK

07:06:16.884 --> 07:06:18.085
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

07:06:18.152 --> 07:06:19.921
AND YOU KNOW AS THE EVEN THAT.

07:06:19.987 --> 07:06:21.122
DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF MINE

07:06:21.188 --> 07:06:22.823
COUNTY HAD. TALKED ABOUT. AND

07:06:22.890 --> 07:06:25.826
THE COUNTIES CLARA. SANTA TAXES-REALLY HAVE BECOME THE TAIL

07:06:25.893 --> 07:06:27.695
THAT WAGS THE DOG IN MANY CASES

07:06:27.762 --> 07:06:29.497
AS- I ALSO PRESENTED A BILL

07:06:29.563 --> 07:06:29.964
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE

07:06:30.031 --> 07:06:31.832
ANNOUNCEMENTS. THE PEOPLE SERVE

07:06:31.899 --> 07:06:34.702

07:06:35.970 --> 07:06:37.371
DO FOR THE PRINCIPLE CRIMES AND

07:06:37.438 --> 07:06:38.606
IF OUR SYSTEM IS ABOUT.

07:06:38.673 --> 07:06:41.208
EDUCATING THE- NUANCES OF A

07:06:41.275 --> 07:06:42.977
CRIME OR EDUCATING WHAT A

07:06:43.044 --> 07:06:45.546
DETAILS ARE ABOUT IT SHOULD BE-

07:06:45.613 --> 07:06:46.847
THE CRITICAL JUST ASSUME SHOULD

07:06:46.914 --> 07:06:48.716
BE HINGED. ON JUST THAT GIANT

07:06:48.783 --> 07:06:49.650
BOOK OF A HUNDRED SIXTY

07:06:49.717 --> 07:06:50.985
ENHANCEMENTS SO. I THINK THIS

07:06:51.052 --> 07:06:52.853
IS A VERY CLEAR. AND SIMPLE

07:06:52.920 --> 07:06:54.088
BILL ABOUT IT THAT IT'S WHICH

07:06:54.155 --> 07:06:54.922
HAS WRAPPED UP A LOT OF

07:06:54.989 --> 07:06:57.158
MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT IT. AND IF

07:06:57.224 --> 07:06:59.393
THERE IS A TIME TO BE AT HONEST

07:06:59.460 --> 07:07:00.528

THIS BILL AS WELL HASN'T BEEN

MOVED YET. NOW I'LL MOVE THE

07:07:09.870 --> 07:07:14.608
BELL- AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT-

07:07:14.675 --> 07:07:16.310
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE IS ON THIS

07:07:16.377 --> 07:07:18.713
COMMITTEE AND THAT HE HAS TAKEN

07:07:18.779 --> 07:07:20.848
TO THIS COMMITTEE LIKE A DUCK

07:07:20.915 --> 07:07:23.818
TO WATER AND IT'S VERY VERY

07:07:23.884 --> 07:07:27.421
GLAD TO HAVE HIM ON HERE- LOOK

07:07:27.488 --> 07:07:28.756
THE POINT OF THE CRIMINAL

07:07:28.823 --> 07:07:31.258
JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TO MAKE LIFE

07:07:31.325 --> 07:07:33.961
SAFER FOR ALL OF US. I DON'T

07:07:34.028 --> 07:07:36.530
THINK PUTTING AWAY A PERSON FOR

07:07:36.597 --> 07:07:38.699
TWENTY YEARS INSTEAD OF TEN

07:07:38.766 --> 07:07:41.502
MAKES MY LIFE SAFER. FRANKLY

07:07:41.569 --> 07:07:43.037
THE SOONER SOMEONE CAN GET A

07:07:43.104 --> 07:07:44.672
GET OUT THE MORE LIKELY THEY

07:07:44.739 --> 07:07:48.342
ARE TO BE RETURNED TO- NORMAL

07:07:48.409 --> 07:07:49.844
LIFE IS SUPPOSED TO A LIFE OF

07:07:49.910 --> 07:07:52.747
CRIME SO I JUST DON'T SEE THE

07:07:52.813 --> 07:07:53.180
POINT OF THESE LONG

07:07:53.247 --> 07:07:55.116
ANNOUNCEMENTS. THIS RESEARCH

07:07:55.182 --> 07:07:56.784
SAYS THAT THEY DO NOT DETER

PEOPLE FROM. COMMITTING CRIMES

07:07:59.687 --> 07:08:02.323

MISTER SEA OTTER THANK YOU.

07:08:08.829 --> 07:08:10.765
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK THE POINT

07:08:10.831 --> 07:08:13.367
OF. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

07:08:13.434 --> 07:08:15.770
IS ACTUALLY TO PROVIDE JUSTICE

07:08:15.836 --> 07:08:18.839
TO VICTIMS A LOT OF TIMES- IT'S

07:08:18.906 --> 07:08:21.509
NOT JUST ABOUT- THAT JUST

07:08:21.575 --> 07:08:25.846
SENTENCE- WE JUST HAD A RECENT

07:08:25.913 --> 07:08:27.314
COURT CARTER RECENT CASE THAT

07:08:27.381 --> 07:08:29.183
WAS WAS SETTLED- WELL

07:08:29.250 --> 07:08:32.920
PUBLICIZED. IT HAS BEEN THE

07:08:32.987 --> 07:08:34.955
SUBJECT OF MUCH ANGST OVER THE

07:08:35.022 --> 07:08:37.224
LAST YEAR. AND THAT IS THE

07:08:37.291 --> 07:08:41.929
TRIAL OF- DEAR CHILDREN. AND

07:08:41.996 --> 07:08:43.731
DEREK SHERMAN WOULD HAVE HAD A

07:08:43.798 --> 07:08:46.267
TWELVE YEAR SENTENCE HAD IT NOT

07:08:46.333 --> 07:08:48.569
BEEN FOR ENHANCEMENTS. I DON'T

07:08:48.636 --> 07:08:50.137
THINK A TWELVE YEAR SENTENCE

07:08:50.204 --> 07:08:53.174
WOULD HAVE- APPROPRIATELY

07:08:53.240 --> 07:08:57.311
ADDRESSED THE OUTRAGE AND

07:08:57.378 --> 07:09:00.915
CONCERNS OVER HIS CONDUCT- OR

07:09:00.981 --> 07:09:03.150
THE OUTCOME OF THAT CONTACT.

07:09:03.217 --> 07:09:05.219
AND IF YOU THAT WERE IN

07:09:05.286 --> 07:09:05.853
CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD

07:09:05.920 --> 07:09:12.393
GET. AND ACCORDING TO THIS. AND

07:09:12.460 --> 07:09:14.161
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S IN THE

07:09:14.228 --> 07:09:17.131
BEST INTEREST OF JUSTICE- I

07:09:17.198 --> 07:09:18.833
THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT

07:09:18.899 --> 07:09:20.935
AND HE SENATE'S ENHANCEMENTS.

07:09:21.001 --> 07:09:24.071
ARE KIND OF IN LIEU OF- TRYING

07:09:24.138 --> 07:09:26.140
THEM ON EACH EACH DIFFERENT

07:09:26.207 --> 07:09:27.842
COUNT OF WHICH WERE BLACK HAIR

07:09:27.908 --> 07:09:32.313
BAND. USED TO DOING. AND THAT'S

07:09:32.379 --> 07:09:34.148
THE JUDICATA BY THE JUDGE AT

07:09:34.215 --> 07:09:35.983
THE END AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

07:09:36.050 --> 07:09:38.119
HAPPENED IN THAT TRIAL.

07:09:38.185 --> 07:09:40.187
HISENSE'S TWELVE YEARS. AND

07:09:40.254 --> 07:09:42.156
ENDED THE JUDGES ABLE TO ADD ON

07:09:42.223 --> 07:09:44.558
SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS FOR

07:09:44.625 --> 07:09:45.659
OPERATING OF THE COLOR OF

07:09:45.726 --> 07:09:47.228
AUTHORITY OR MISUSING HIS

07:09:47.294 --> 07:09:50.564
AUTHORITY. AND AND THEN BUT I

07:09:50.631 --> 07:09:52.233
FORGOT WHAT THE OTHER ONE WAS.

07:09:52.299 --> 07:09:54.602
THE ADDED TEN YEARS AND TWENTY

07:09:54.668 --> 07:09:56.036
TWO AND A HALF YEARS SEEMS MORE

07:09:56.103 --> 07:09:59.306
LIKE A JUST SENTENCE. TEN

07:09:59.373 --> 07:10:01.609
TWELVE. IF YOU'RE OUT IN EIGHT.

07:10:01.675 --> 07:10:02.910
BECAUSE IF YOU DO GOOD TIME.

07:10:02.977 --> 07:10:05.246
GOING OUT NAY. I WOULD OFFERED

07:10:05.312 --> 07:10:06.914
AND I DOUBT VERY MUCH THAT MR

07:10:06.981 --> 07:10:08.516
CHAU VAN WOULD DO ANYTHING TO

07:10:08.582 --> 07:10:10.518
ANYBODY IF WE RELATE. IS NOT IN

07:10:10.584 --> 07:10:12.453
JAIL FOR THAT IS NOT IN JAIL

07:10:12.520 --> 07:10:13.654
BECAUSE WERE AFRAID HE'S GOING

07:10:13.721 --> 07:10:16.857
TO DO SOMETHING TO SOMEBODY

07:10:16.924 --> 07:10:17.491
ELSE IS IN JAIL BECAUSE WHAT HE

07:10:17.558 --> 07:10:19.093
DID. AND THAT'S WHAT I SEE AS

07:10:19.160 --> 07:10:20.427
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

07:10:20.494 --> 07:10:22.763
WORKING CORRECTLY. AND WE HAVE

07:10:22.830 --> 07:10:24.198
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT CONTINUES

07:10:24.265 --> 07:10:25.399
TO WORK CORRECTLY IN THE FUTURE

07:10:25.466 --> 07:10:27.067
I DON'T THINK THIS HELPS. SO

07:10:27.134 --> 07:10:29.003
UNFORTUNATELY TODAY ON THIS

07:10:29.069 --> 07:10:30.571
BILL I CANNOT SUPPORT YOU KNOW

07:10:30.638 --> 07:10:34.642
THANK YOU. THANK YOU I NEED A

07:10:34.708 --> 07:10:36.777
FEW MORE COMMON FOR. YOU MAY

07:10:36.844 --> 07:10:40.581
CLOSE I'M THANK YOU CHAIR- WE

07:10:40.648 --> 07:10:42.149
OBVIOUSLY HAVE MANY BILLS

07:10:42.216 --> 07:10:43.584
REGARDING ENHANCEMENTS THAT

07:10:43.651 --> 07:10:46.787
COME BEFORE US AND- THE END

07:10:46.854 --> 07:10:48.756
THERE ARE MERITS TO ALL OF THEM

07:10:48.822 --> 07:10:50.958
THE APPROACH AS THE WITNESSES

07:10:51.025 --> 07:10:53.160
WHO TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT.

07:10:53.227 --> 07:10:53.928
EXPLAINED THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

07:10:53.994 --> 07:10:56.030
TAKE IN THIS ONE IS RATHER THAN

07:10:56.096 --> 07:10:59.266
ELIMINATING THE ENHANCEMENTS.

07:10:59.333 --> 07:11:01.035
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY ONE COULD

07:11:01.101 --> 07:11:02.570
MAKE A GOOD ARGUMENT HE PER

07:11:02.636 --> 07:11:04.638
CLIENT FOR ANYONE OF THE

07:11:04.705 --> 07:11:06.740
HUNDRED AND SIXTY. IT WAS TO BE

07:11:06.807 --> 07:11:09.009
ABLE TO. PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO

07:11:09.076 --> 07:11:10.578
THE JUDGE NOW OBVIOUSLY THE

07:11:10.644 --> 07:11:12.446
DA'S ASSOCIATION BILLS IT TIES

07:11:12.513 --> 07:11:15.316
THEIR HANDS HOWEVER WE DID HEAR

07:11:15.382 --> 07:11:17.685
FROM JUDGE ESPINOZA WHO ALONG

07:11:17.751 --> 07:11:19.620
WITH JUSTICE CARLOS MORENO

07:11:19.687 --> 07:11:21.021
JUSTICE CARLOS MORENO WAS

07:11:21.088 --> 07:11:22.790
FORMER CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

07:11:22.856 --> 07:11:24.825
JUSTICE. BOTH TO SERVE ON THE

07:11:24.892 --> 07:11:26.660
COMMITTEE AND BOTH TO HELP TO

07:11:26.727 --> 07:11:29.296
DRAFT THIS THEY FELT THAT THIS

07:11:29.363 --> 07:11:31.765
WAS THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO GO

07:11:31.832 --> 07:11:34.568
FOR JUDGES. AND WHEN WE LOOKED

07:11:34.635 --> 07:11:35.869
AT ENHANCEMENTS THIS WAS THE

07:11:35.936 --> 07:11:37.171
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE

07:11:37.238 --> 07:11:38.906
COMMITTEE MADE VERSUS MANY

07:11:38.973 --> 07:11:40.741
OTHERS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

07:11:40.808 --> 07:11:44.078
ABLE TO CONTEMPLATE. AND THEY

07:11:44.144 --> 07:11:46.981
BELIEVE THAT IT DID STILL

07:11:47.047 --> 07:11:47.615
PROVIDE DISCRETION TO THE

07:11:47.681 --> 07:11:51.986
JUDGE- BECAUSE IN THE IF I WANT

07:11:52.052 --> 07:11:53.320
TO USE THE DIRECTOR OF AN

07:11:53.387 --> 07:11:55.322
EXAMPLE AND IT'S HARD BECAUSE

07:11:55.389 --> 07:11:57.324
I'M NOT THE JUDGE IN THAT CASE

07:11:57.391 --> 07:12:01.328
NOR WAS I THE JURY SO I CAN'T I

07:12:01.395 --> 07:12:04.231
CAN ONLY PURPORT. TO SAY WHAT I

07:12:04.298 --> 07:12:06.700
THINK EITHER HIS CHARACTER IS

07:12:06.767 --> 07:12:08.902
OR HIS MOTIVATION HOWEVER. THAT

07:12:08.969 --> 07:12:13.173
JUDGE. MAY DETERMINATION RIGHT

07:12:13.240 --> 07:12:15.276
SO IN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH

07:12:15.342 --> 07:12:17.678
THIS BILL IF THE JUDGE IN SUCH

07:12:17.745 --> 07:12:19.480
A CIRCUMSTANCE FELT THAT IT WAS

07:12:19.546 --> 07:12:20.514
THE FURTHERANCE OF PUBLIC

07:12:20.581 --> 07:12:23.484
SAFETY TO ADD ENHANCEMENTS TO

07:12:23.550 --> 07:12:25.986
THE SENTENCE OF SOMEONE LIKE MR

07:12:26.053 --> 07:12:29.256
CHILDREN HE WOULD BE ABLE TO-

07:12:29.323 --> 07:12:31.258
SO THAT'S REALLY THE PURPOSE OF

07:12:31.325 --> 07:12:36.230
THE BILL AND- WHAT I WOULD NOTE

07:12:36.297 --> 07:12:40.301
IS THAT. THE DA ASSOCIATION IS

07:12:40.367 --> 07:12:42.770
OPPOSED TO EVERY ENHANCEMENT

07:12:42.836 --> 07:12:44.138
BILL THAT IS ON THAT IS BEING

07:12:44.204 --> 07:12:46.907
PROPOSED THIS YEAR AND HAS BEEN

07:12:46.974 --> 07:12:50.210
IN THE PAST- I WOULD WELCOME

07:12:50.277 --> 07:12:52.646
SOME CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS

07:12:52.713 --> 07:12:54.615
HOWEVER AND I'M NOT LOOKING.

07:12:54.682 --> 07:12:57.751
THEY HAVE A CERTAIN ROLE- SO

07:12:57.818 --> 07:13:00.054
WHAT THEY ARE YOU KNOW. WHETHER

07:13:00.120 --> 07:13:01.822
THEY WOULD CONSTRUCT SOMETHING

07:13:01.889 --> 07:13:03.223
VERY DIFFERENTLY OR EVEN

07:13:03.290 --> 07:13:05.292
ENTERTAINED SOMETHING DIFFERENT

07:13:05.359 --> 07:13:07.795
THIS I CAN'T REALLY SAY HOWEVER

07:13:07.861 --> 07:13:09.730
IT IS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE HAVING

07:13:09.797 --> 07:13:11.632
BEEN CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY FOR

07:13:11.699 --> 07:13:13.701
FOUR YEARS IN THE SENATE. AND

07:13:13.767 --> 07:13:15.469
SERVED ON IT FOR MANY MANY MORE

07:13:15.536 --> 07:13:18.906
YEARS IT IS NOT EVER BEEN

07:13:18.972 --> 07:13:21.709
THERE'S NOT BEEN A SINGLE. BILL

07:13:21.775 --> 07:13:23.077
REGARDING ANY ASPECT OF

07:13:23.143 --> 07:13:26.447
ENHANCEMENTS MEANING TO EITHER-

07:13:26.513 --> 07:13:27.881
AB PUT GUARDRAILS ON THEM

07:13:27.948 --> 07:13:29.783
ELIMINATE THEM OR OTHERWISE

07:13:29.850 --> 07:13:30.884
THAT I'VE SEEN THE DA

07:13:30.951 --> 07:13:34.888
ASSOCIATION SUPPORT- AGAIN THAT

07:13:34.955 --> 07:13:38.325
DOESN'T NECESSARILY- INDICATE

07:13:38.392 --> 07:13:39.893
THE MERIT OR NON MERIT OF THEIR

07:13:39.960 --> 07:13:41.628
ARGUMENT ANYONE CASE I JUST

07:13:41.695 --> 07:13:43.964
MEAN THAT IT IS. IT WOULD BE

07:13:44.031 --> 07:13:46.100
MORE HELPFUL FOR MANY OF US IF

07:13:46.166 --> 07:13:48.202
WE HAD KEPT THE CONSTRUCTIVE

07:13:48.268 --> 07:13:51.171
SUGGESTIONS- BUT I THINK THE

07:13:51.238 --> 07:13:53.707
BILL IS SOUND AND AS I

07:13:53.774 --> 07:13:55.042
INDICATED I ACCEPT THE

07:13:55.109 --> 07:13:57.911
COMMITTEES MMS. AND I WOULD ASK

07:13:57.978 --> 07:14:00.848
FOR YOUR VOTE. IT THANK YOU

07:14:00.914 --> 07:14:02.683
AND- THE DISHES THIS IS

07:14:02.750 --> 07:14:04.651
INTERESTING I USED TO BE ABLE

07:14:04.718 --> 07:14:06.553
TO SAY. THAT I'M PROBABLY THE

07:14:06.620 --> 07:14:08.389
LONGEST SERVING MEMBER IN THE

07:14:08.455 --> 07:14:11.458
LEGISLATURE DAN DID I SEE YOU.

07:14:11.525 --> 07:14:13.227
AND I HAVE TO STAND CORRECTED

07:14:13.293 --> 07:14:15.195
SOMEONE WHO SERVED WITH YOU IN

07:14:15.262 --> 07:14:16.864
THE ASSEMBLY ON THIS COMMITTEE

07:14:16.930 --> 07:14:20.601
YES- WE REMEMBER BACK WHEN I

07:14:20.667 --> 07:14:21.902
KNOW WHEN I CAME IN TWENTY

07:14:21.969 --> 07:14:23.637
TWELVE. WE'RE VERY SUSPICIOUS

07:14:23.704 --> 07:14:25.706
OF JUDGES BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN

07:14:25.773 --> 07:14:26.673
TO THREE STRIKES MANDATORY

07:14:26.740 --> 07:14:28.375
MINIMUMS AND THAT'S WHAT THEY

07:14:28.442 --> 07:14:29.643
GAVE UP THEY GAVE IT OUT LIKE

07:14:29.710 --> 07:14:32.813
CANDY AND POPCORN JUST JUST

07:14:32.880 --> 07:14:34.114
GIVING IT AND WE DID TRUST.

07:14:34.181 --> 07:14:36.583
JUDGES HAVE DISCRETION. I THINK

07:14:36.650 --> 07:14:38.719
WE WERE VERY HARD. TO KIND OF

07:14:38.786 --> 07:14:41.155
CHANGE THE ATTITUDE IN THE MAKE

07:14:41.221 --> 07:14:44.057
UP OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM. TO PROVE

07:14:44.124 --> 07:14:44.992
THAT LOOK WHERE WE ARE NOW

07:14:45.058 --> 07:14:46.727
YOU'RE- YOU'RE TRYING TO GIVE

07:14:46.794 --> 07:14:49.129
JUDGES MORE DISCRETION. SO THAT

07:14:49.196 --> 07:14:50.597
THEY CAN MAKE MORE INFORMED

07:14:50.664 --> 07:14:52.933
DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO. AND

07:14:53.000 --> 07:14:55.936
AS I READ HERE THE BILL. HAS

07:14:56.003 --> 07:14:58.038
WHAT IT SAYS THIS BILL WOULD

07:14:58.105 --> 07:15:00.774
EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED. REQUIRE

07:15:00.841 --> 07:15:03.243
COURT DISMISSED AN ENHANCEMENT

07:15:03.310 --> 07:15:07.414
IF. IT IS IN THE FURTHERANCE OF

07:15:07.481 --> 07:15:09.883
JUSTICE TO DO SO. THE BILL

07:15:09.950 --> 07:15:11.885
WOULD CREATE A PRESUMPTION THAT

07:15:11.952 --> 07:15:13.287
IS IT IS IT IS IN THE

07:15:13.353 --> 07:15:14.621
FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE TO

07:15:14.688 --> 07:15:16.490
DISMISS AN ENHANCEMENT IS

07:15:16.557 --> 07:15:18.592
SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES. THE

07:15:18.659 --> 07:15:20.627
BILL WITH STATE. THAT THIS

07:15:20.694 --> 07:15:24.631
PRESUMPTION IS ONLY OVERCOME

07:15:24.698 --> 07:15:27.434
UPON A SHOWING BY CLEAR. AND

07:15:27.501 --> 07:15:30.237
CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT

07:15:30.304 --> 07:15:32.539
DISMISSAL OF THE ENHANCEMENT

07:15:32.606 --> 07:15:34.975
WOULD ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY SO

07:15:35.042 --> 07:15:37.377
IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC IS NOT IT

07:15:37.444 --> 07:15:39.613
YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO HAVE

07:15:39.680 --> 07:15:42.449
BECAUSE IN REASON AND FOR THAT

07:15:42.516 --> 07:15:44.618
REASON I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL-

07:15:44.685 --> 07:15:46.653
I THINK IT DEMONSTRATES WHERE

07:15:46.720 --> 07:15:48.856
WE ARE TODAY. AND THE FACT THAT

07:15:48.922 --> 07:15:50.557
OTHERS DO NOT WANT TO GIVE

07:15:50.624 --> 07:15:52.893
JUDGES WERE AFRAID TO GIVE

07:15:52.960 --> 07:15:56.230
JUDGES DISCRETION- SHOWS YOU

07:15:56.296 --> 07:15:57.598
HOW SUCCESSFUL WE'VE BEEN. OVER

07:15:57.664 --> 07:15:59.500
A LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO TRY TO

07:15:59.566 --> 07:16:00.334
CHANGE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

07:16:00.400 --> 07:16:02.836
SYSTEM AT THE JUDICIAL LEVEL

07:16:02.903 --> 07:16:03.971
AND WE JUST STILL HAVE A LONG

07:16:04.037 --> 07:16:05.339
WAY TO GO WITH THE REST OF THE

07:16:05.405 --> 07:16:08.141
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. SO THE

07:33:15.034 --> 07:33:16.969
LAUGH TODAY AND HOPING THAT YOU

07:33:17.036 --> 07:33:18.638

AND GET THE AMENDMENTS TO WHERE

07:33:20.306 --> 07:33:22.875
I THINK. IT'S ACCEPTABLE SO

07:33:22.942 --> 07:33:24.644
THAT IT'S NOT UNFAIRLY.

07:33:24.710 --> 07:33:26.712
TARGETING OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T

07:33:26.779 --> 07:33:28.581
DESERVE TO BE UNFAIRLY TARGETED

07:33:28.648 --> 07:33:30.349
AND SO. I'LL BE LAYING OFF

07:33:30.416 --> 07:33:31.851

07:33:31.918 --> 07:33:33.452
ABLE TO GET TO WHERE I COULD

07:33:33.519 --> 07:33:38.324

07:33:38.391 --> 07:33:40.092
THE QUESTION IS A QUESTION. YOU

07:33:40.159 --> 07:33:42.995
YOU MAY CLOSE Q. I KNOW YOU'VE

07:33:43.062 --> 07:33:43.963
HAD A LONG DAY WHICH IS WHY

07:33:44.030 --> 07:33:45.565
DIDN'T EXPLAIN A LOT OF THE

07:33:45.631 --> 07:33:48.167
BILL BUT BASICALLY IT'S- A

07:33:48.234 --> 07:33:50.603
LIMITED EXPANSION OF. PUBLIC

07:33:50.670 --> 07:33:52.572
ACCESS TO SOME RECORDS ON A SET

07:33:52.638 --> 07:33:55.508
OF- CONDUCT BY OFFICERS WHICH-

07:33:55.575 --> 07:33:57.677
THE- ARE WITNESSING SUPPORT

07:33:57.743 --> 07:33:59.579
ARTICULATED AND THESE ARE IN

07:33:59.645 --> 07:34:00.947
ALL CASES BUT ONE SUSTAIN

07:34:01.013 --> 07:34:03.282
FINDINGS. SO THEY MUST BE THE

07:34:03.349 --> 07:34:04.984
OFFICERS CONDUCT MUST HAVE BEEN

07:34:05.051 --> 07:34:06.652
INVESTIGATED AND SUSTAIN BEFORE

07:34:06.719 --> 07:34:07.253
THESE RCORDS WOULD BE

07:34:07.320 --> 07:34:10.156
RELEASED. NO MY THE BILL WHEN

07:34:10.222 --> 07:34:13.426
IT PASSED LAST YEAR. HAD VERY

07:34:13.492 --> 07:34:16.095
HIGH FINES ON WEEK BECAUSE WE

07:34:16.162 --> 07:34:18.631
EXPERIENCED WHEN FOR AFTER

07:34:18.698 --> 07:34:19.265
FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WAS PASSED

07:34:19.332 --> 07:34:20.666
THAT MANY CITIES REALLY

07:34:20.733 --> 07:34:22.034
DIRECTOR FEET THERE ARE STILL

07:34:22.101 --> 07:34:22.969
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE NOT

07:34:23.035 --> 07:34:24.704
RELEASED RECORDS. SO WE ADDED

07:34:24.770 --> 07:34:25.838
SOME FINES AND WE'RE GOING TO

07:34:25.905 --> 07:34:27.907
ADD ATTORNEY'S FEES BUT WE

07:34:27.974 --> 07:34:30.643
REMOVED TO THOSE. IN THE SENATE

07:34:30.710 --> 07:34:32.445
APPROACH BECAUSE WE REALIZE

07:34:32.511 --> 07:34:34.780
THAT. WHILE WE WANT TO INCREASE

07:34:34.847 --> 07:34:36.082
ENFORCEMENT IT WOULD STILL

07:34:36.148 --> 07:34:37.750
REQUIRE SOMEONE TO TAKE THE

07:34:37.817 --> 07:34:39.385
JURISDICTION OF COURT AND SO

07:34:39.452 --> 07:34:40.653
REALLY WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING

07:34:40.720 --> 07:34:42.655
TO DO IS ACHIEVE GOOD WELL. AND

07:34:42.722 --> 07:34:45.558
WE KNOW THAT- WHAT HAPPENED

07:34:45.625 --> 07:34:46.926
WITH FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IST

07:34:46.993 --> 07:34:48.361
WHEN IT WENT INTO EFFECT THERE

07:34:48.427 --> 07:34:49.962
WAS A FLOOD OF REQUESTS RIGHT

07:34:50.029 --> 07:34:51.397
IN THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY AND

07:34:51.464 --> 07:34:52.264
IT WAS A LOT OF WORK FOR THE

07:34:52.331 --> 07:34:54.033
JURISDICTION SO IF YOU NOTICE

07:34:54.100 --> 07:34:55.735
WHAT OF. THE AMENDMENTS I ALSO

07:34:55.801 --> 07:34:58.671

GET SUBMITTED HOWEVER THEY

07:35:17.390 --> 07:35:18.658

07:35:18.724 --> 07:35:20.793
AND THIRTY DAYS. AND RELEASE

07:35:20.860 --> 07:35:23.229
THEM SO WE FELT THAT THAT WAS

07:35:23.295 --> 07:35:25.631
MORE THAN FAIR. AND MOST

07:35:25.698 --> 07:35:28.034
RECORDS ARE NOW DIGITAL SO MANY

07:35:28.100 --> 07:35:29.201

CHIEFS NOW SUPPORT AND MOST LAW

07:35:40.146 --> 07:35:41.814
