00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:46.383
EVEN IF WE MAKE ROSS- IROC

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.919
PERFECT IN THE FUTURE WE ARE

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:51.355
NEVER GOING TO ALLEVIATE THE

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:52.823
NEED FOR THIS SURGE FROM

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.458
ADJACENT RESOURCES THAT'S JUST

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:55.826
GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.495
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO NEED TO

00:39:57.561 --> 00:40:00.664
DO. TO THAT END. HELLO YES IN

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:02.333
THE FIRES GO BOARD HAS PUT

00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:04.435
TOGETHER A PILOT PROGRAM. IT'S

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:05.803
CALLED EXPEDITED RESOURCE

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.339
RESPONSE OR E. R. R. IT'S A

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:10.107
IT'S A PILOT PROGRAM BETWEEN.

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:12.610
VENTURA LA COUNTY LA CITY

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:14.645
ORANGE COUNTY IN IT WHAT IT

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:16.480
DOES IS IT MEMORIALIZES EXACTLY

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:17.882
WHAT WE DO AND I THINK THAT'S

00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:20.117
PROBABLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA NEED

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:20.718
FOR THE FUTURE IS JUST TO SAY

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:23.821
OUT LOUD. THAT THE SYSTEM IS A

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:25.256
COMPLEX SYSTEM AND THERE'S

00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:26.524
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS ARE

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.391
GONNA MAKE A SUCCESSFUL AND

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:28.192
HAVING THOSE LOCAL

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.393
JURISDICTIONS HAVE THAT

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.728
RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE CAN.

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:32.129
SQUEEZE RESOURCES INTO ONE

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:34.231
AGENCY AND GET THEM BACK. IS

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:35.599
GOING TO MAKE THIS THE SYSTEM

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:37.868
PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL. SO THE

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:38.469
CHALLENGES WITH THE WALLS THE

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:42.573
FIRE. ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.974
WAS OBVIOUSLY TWENTY MINUTES

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:46.177
PRIOR WE HAD THE HELL FIRE AND

00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:47.645
A SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE NEED

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:48.979
THERE WE WERE COMPETING WITH

00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:50.447
THE CAMP FIRE THAT HAD STARTED

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.283
EARLIER THAT MORNING. THIS IS

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:53.651
VERY DIFFERENT THAN THOMAS FIRE

00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:54.652
WHERE WE WERE PRETTY MUCH THE

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:56.120
ONLY FIRE IN THE STATE AND WE

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:57.588
PROBABLY ENDED UP RECEIVING

00:40:57.655 --> 00:40:59.557
TWICE AS MANY RESOURCES AS WE

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:03.694
DID ON THE WALLS THE FIRE. SO

00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:04.795
ONE THING TO NOTICE THAT OUR

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:06.163
MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN THE

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:07.298
RESOURCES THAT ARE IN IT WILL

00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:09.233
NEVER BE ENOUGH AND AS I

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.534
ATTENDED COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND

00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:12.837
WE HAD A LOT OF UNDERSTANDABLY

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:14.305
UPSET CONSTITUENTS AND

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:16.140
HOMEOWNERS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:17.675
IS THE CONSISTENT MESSAGE WAS

00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:19.410
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH RESOURCES

00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:20.611
THERE WEREN'T ENGINES IN MY

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:22.479
HEAD NEIGHBORHOOD THERE WEREN'T

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:24.248
ENGINES AT MY HOUSE AND- I

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.783
THINK BY THE MOST POWERFUL

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:26.517
THING WAS JUST TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:29.019
THAT. THIS EIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:30.654
THERE WEREN'T AND THERE

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:33.691
PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE. AND

00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:35.659
WHAT WE DO THOUGH IS WHAT WE

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:36.961
TAKE THAT THE LIMITED RESOURCES

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:38.495
WE HAVE BEEN WILL TRIAGE HE

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:39.797
SITUATION WE PUT THEM WHERE

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:41.465
THEY CAN DO THE VERY MOST GOOD

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:43.167
AND WE TRY AND DO THE BEST WE

00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:45.436
CAN WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE.

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:46.837
YEAH IF WE HAD HAD DOUBLE THE

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:48.706
RESOURCES WE STILL WOULD HAVE

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:51.675
HAD SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. SO ONE

00:41:51.742 --> 00:41:53.077
OF THE SOLUTIONS ALSO THAT WE

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:56.046
NEED TO DO AS WE GO FORWARD IS

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:56.513
TO CHANGE THE PUBLIC'S

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.116
EXPECTATIONS. AS WE HAVE SAID

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:00.551
YOU KNOW WE HAVE A NEW NORMAL

00:42:00.618 --> 00:42:02.486
OUR FIRES A SPREAD MUCH MORE

00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:04.555
QUICKLY OUR FIRE SEASON IS YEAR

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:06.190
ROUND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:08.092
PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS IS AS FAR

00:42:08.158 --> 00:42:10.261
AS- WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IN

00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:11.762
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN WE HAVE

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:12.630
A FIRE AND WE NEED THE PUBLIC

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:14.632
TO PARTNER WITH US TO- IN AN

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:15.666
EFFORT TO BE PREPARED THAT

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:17.434
MEANS. IT'S DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:19.803
IT'S HARDENING THEIR STRUCTURES

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.739
IN ADVANCE OF FIRE SEASON

00:42:21.805 --> 00:42:23.407
SOMTIMES IT'S YOU KNOW JUST

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:24.241
CHANGING UP THE ORNAMENT

00:42:24.308 --> 00:42:26.176
ORNAMENTAL VEGETATION SOMETIMES

00:42:26.243 --> 00:42:29.346
IT MEANS. GOING AND- YEAH PLATE

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:31.148
REPLACING THEIR THEIR ATTIC

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:32.783
VENTS SCREEN SO IT'S A SMALLER

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.251
THING BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:35.753
HOMES ARE DESTROYED BY. THE

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:37.154
AMBER ENVIRONMENT NOT DIRECT

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:39.757
FLAME CONTACT. AND THEN IT'S

00:42:39.823 --> 00:42:40.457
ALSO HAVING A PREPARED

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:42.226
COMMUNITY THAT PARTICIPATES IN

00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:44.528
A WRECK SAID GO PROGRAM SO THAT

00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:45.729
THEY ARE WELL PLANNED IN

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:47.231
ADVANCE. AND WHEN THEY SEE

00:42:47.298 --> 00:42:49.833
SMOKE IN THE AIR THE PLAN IS

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.801
ALREADY IN PLACE THEY HAVE ALL

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:52.236
THEIR VALUABLES THEY KNOW WHERE

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:53.370
THEY ARE THEY CAN PLACE THEM IN

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:55.039
THE CAR AND AS SOON AS WORD

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:56.573
COMES OUT FROM. EITHER LAW

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.708
ENFORCEMENT OF THE EVACUATED

00:42:57.775 --> 00:43:00.444
DELAYED. BECAUSE WE KNOW FIRE.

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:01.278
WILL RISK A LITTLE TO A LITTLE

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:03.280
RISK LET SABLE. WHEN LIVES ARE

00:43:03.347 --> 00:43:04.949
IN JEOPARDY WE HAVE TO RISK SO

00:43:05.015 --> 00:43:07.351
MUCH MORE. AND THAT'S ONE OF

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:09.787
pSEEN I SOUGHT THE FIRST TIMEON

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:11.755
THE THOMAS FIRE. IS IT

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:12.723
TYPICALLY WHEN WE SEND OUR

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.625
ENGINES UP THERE ON NORMAL

00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:15.859
FIRES WERE TRYING TO WORK ON

00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:17.061
PERIMETER CONTROL TO PUT OUT

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:18.529
THE FIRE AND WIND DRIVEN FIRES

00:43:18.595 --> 00:43:19.997
WE TYPICALLY GO UP AND START

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:21.966
STRUCTURE PROTECTION. WHAT WE

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:23.567
SAW ON THE THOMAS FIRE WAS THAT

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:24.668
OUR ENGINES DIDN'T EVEN HAVE

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:25.869
TIME TO PROTECT STRUCTURES THEY

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:28.205
WERE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN A

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:30.240
LIFESAVING EVACUATIONS. ONLY

00:43:30.307 --> 00:43:31.408
PEOPLE OUT OF THE HOMES

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:32.876
THROWING THEM IN OUR FIRE

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.044
ENGINES A SAME THING WAS

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:35.446
HAPPENING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:43:35.512 --> 00:43:36.847
THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:38.916
IN THE WALLS THE FIRE. WE HAVE

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:40.150
A WHOLE NEW NORMAL THAT WE'RE

DEALING WITH AND A PUBLIC THAT

00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:44.088
NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE. SOME

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:47.391
NOTABLE SUCCESSES. THE VALUE OF

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:48.625
PRE POSITIONING AS YOU WILL

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:50.661

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHAT THAT

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:06.844
DOES IS IT IF THEY HAVE STOOD

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.045
UP ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:09.780
ALLOWS THEM TO SEND ADDITIONAL

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:12.149
RESOURCES TO THEIR NEIGHBORS IT

00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:12.783

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:00.357
IS WILLIAM MISSING AND I'M

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:01.191
MAYBE MY UNION PRESENT WILL

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.494
SPEAK TO THAT A PREFIX AFTER I

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.929
SPEAK IS THE IMPACT IT HAS ON

00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:08.098
PEOPLE. THE IMPACT IT HAS ON

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:09.700
OUR FIREFIGHTERS. I'M EVEN

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:11.135
DOING THE WILL THE FIRE I TO

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:13.237
TAKE A TIME OUT AND CALL. MY

00:46:13.303 --> 00:46:14.471
COUNTERPARTS DIFFERENCE IN JUST

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:16.206
ASK HOW DO I MANAGE HIS BECAUSE

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:19.009
FORTUNATELY FOR ME. HE DON'T

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:20.677
THE THOMAS FIRE BEFORE AND SO.

00:46:20.744 --> 00:46:21.812
I WAS JUST OVERWHELMING TO

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:22.880
THINK THAT WE WERE DOING

00:46:22.946 --> 00:46:24.114
SOMETHING THAT EXCEEDED THE

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:25.883
CAPACITY OF OUR ORGANIZATION.

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:29.686
AND IT'S HARD TO CAPTURE THAT.

00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:30.921
I'M EVEN WITH OUR UNION

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:31.989
PRESIDENT WHEN WE ARE ASKING

00:46:32.055 --> 00:46:33.457
FOR MUTUAL AID. AND WE DIDN'T

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:35.159
GET ENOUGH FR ME TO PLAY. THE

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:36.960
REPORT SAYS THAT AT THE END OF

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:38.829
THE DAY 53% OF REQUEST ON

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:40.931
FIELD. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:43.233
CRITICAL TIMES OF THE FIRE. WAS

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.202
OVER SEVENTY PERCENT. BECAUSE

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:45.836
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BEGINNING

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:47.571
OF OUR FIRE WERE BEGAN A

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:49.373
VENTURA COUNTY. BY THE TIME WE

00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:50.908
GOT TO THE SAID THE GOSHEN IT

00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:52.576
WAS LIKE EIGHTEEN HOURS. THOSE

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.111
OVER 90% OF THE FIRE HAPPENED

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:55.879
WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. SO

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:57.114
WHAT KIND OF MILK MUTUALLY

00:46:57.181 --> 00:46:59.683
RESOURCES FUNNY CAME. WHEN THEY

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:00.784
DID COME AND IT WASN'T ENOUGH

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:02.920
OF THEM. AS SOME FROM OUT OF

00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.621
STATE. SEVERAL DAYS LATER THE

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:05.789
HELP THIS MONTH THE FIRE UP

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:08.058
BUT- FOR THE MOST PART. WHAT

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.260
WAS GONNA HAPPEN HAPPENED- BUT

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:13.864
WAS HARD TO. ARTICULATE AS FAR

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:16.333
FAR FAR TO ASKING FOR HELP IN A

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:16.934
SCREAM FOR HELP THEY CAN'T GET

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.436
IT. WAS HARD TO ARTICULATE IS

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:21.338
WHEN YOU CAN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH

00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:22.005
ASSISTANCE AND I'M GOING TO

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:23.373
BUY. UNION PRESIDENT TO

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.309
MADHAPAR IMHO YOU TO SAY WE

00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:26.577
CAN'T DO THE WORK RIGHT CYCLE

00:47:26.643 --> 00:47:28.378
WHICH IS NORMALLY. A TWELVE ARE

00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:30.280
CYCLE THE FIRST FORTY EIGHT

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:31.915
HOURS OF OUR INCIDENT. OUR

00:47:31.982 --> 00:47:34.751
FOREFATHERS WROTE. WAS FROM. ME

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:36.486
TOWARDS WHEN A WORKER THAT NO

00:47:36.553 --> 00:47:38.722
ONE GOT SLEEP. AT THE SAME TIME

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:39.156
WE HAVE TO TAKE IN

00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:41.258
CONSIDERATION THAT AND A MAJOR

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.593
ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS MINE WE

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:44.595
SO GET OVER A THOUSAND OTHER

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:46.730
CALLS A DAY THAT DON'T GO AWAY.

00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:47.364
AND DURING THE FOOTPRINT OF THE

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:49.833
WHEELS THE FIRE ANOTHER

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:50.867
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MEDICAL

00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:52.236
EMERGENCY CALLS CAME IN BECAUSE

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:54.238
OF PEOPLE TRAPPED OR NOT

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:56.039
KNOWING WHAT TO DO SO THOSE ARE

00:47:56.106 --> 00:48:00.177
SOME SALIENT RIO. BEHAVIORAL

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:02.646
MENTAL STRESSFUL THINGS ARE FAR

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:04.815
FAR AS GO THROUGH. AND THEN THE

00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:07.251
AFTERMATH FROM ANY FIRE CHIEF

00:48:07.317 --> 00:48:10.020
IN THIS ROOM. IS REALLY GO OUT

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:10.621
TO A COMMUNITY EXPLAIN WHY WE

00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:12.623
LOST HER HOME. AND I THINK THAT

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:14.825
WE ALL SYMPATHETIC AND LISTEN

00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:15.959
TO SOMEONE LOSE THEIR HOME AND

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:16.560
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:19.129
LIKE. BUT IS NOT A GOOD FEELING

00:48:19.196 --> 00:48:21.531
TO EXPLAIN IT TO SOMEONE OR FAR

00:48:21.598 --> 00:48:22.532
FAR FORCES AT WORK IN THOSE

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:24.534
COMMUNITIES. AND GET SOME OF

00:48:24.601 --> 00:48:27.437
THE RAF OF A TWO FOUR- THEIR

00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:30.140
INABILITY TO PROTECT ALL THE

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:31.174
HOMES WHEN IT WASN'T THEIR

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:32.843
FAULT. BECAUSE WE CANNOT

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:35.212
PROVIDE ENOUGH RESOURCES. I

00:48:35.279 --> 00:48:37.180
AGREE WITH CHIEF RUNS IN. A WE

00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:39.650
WOULD NEVER HAVE ENOUGH

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:41.418
RESOURCES BUT WE NEED MORE WAS

00:48:41.485 --> 00:48:42.519
WORTH MENTIONING THAT WAS THE

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:44.621
FIRE. WAS THAT WE DID

00:48:44.688 --> 00:48:47.791
SUCCESSFULLY EVACUATE OVER

00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:48.325
TWENTY FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:49.826
PEOPLE. AND WE DID HAVE TO

00:48:49.893 --> 00:48:51.895
PRIORITIZE WE MADE A PROP A

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:53.530
PRIORITY TO FOCUS ON LIFE

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:55.932
FIRST. AND ALL THE EXIT

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:58.068
CORRIDORS WHEN IT JUMP TO ONE

00:48:58.135 --> 00:48:59.002
ONE FREEWAY THE ONLY EXIT

00:48:59.069 --> 00:49:01.071
QUARTER LEFT WAS PCH SO THE

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:02.539
COLLABORATION BETWEEN. LA

00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:04.408
COUNTY VENTURA CH P. SHERIFF

00:49:04.474 --> 00:49:06.009
WAS AND THE CITIZENS WAS

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:08.278
REMARKABLE. AND AT THE SAME

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:10.614
TIME OUR FIREFIGHTERS BECAUSE

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:11.181
WHEN I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO MY

00:49:11.248 --> 00:49:12.983
GOVERNING BODY. WHICH WAS NOT

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:15.552
OTHER EASY THING TO DO. WHY WE

00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:17.487
LOST OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOMES.

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:19.189
IS THAT I TOLD THEM WE DON'T

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:20.791
HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO

00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:22.125
EVERYTHING SO WE FOCUSED ON

00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:26.129
LIFE. AT THE EXPENSE OF

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:29.733
KNOWINGLY LOSING STRUCTURES. SO

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.202
ANY ADDITIONAL APPARATUS THAT

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:34.471
WE CAN GET THROUGH STORAGE

00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:35.839
COULD HAVE SAVED THAT MANY MORE

00:49:35.906 --> 00:49:38.608
STRUCTURES. WAS WAS MENTIONED

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:41.945
IN THE REPORT AND- I KNOW THE

00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:44.915
TOW BAR MAYBE HERE- YES MAY BE

00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:46.717
BEHIND ME I DON'T KNOW IF THE-

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:47.784
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GONNA

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:50.854
SPEAK IS THAT. ON THE RULES LEE

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:57.761
FIRE. ARM MOST OF THE- PUT

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:00.330
PRINT WAS NOT LOCAL

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:05.369
RESPONSIBILITY. OVER 40% I WAS

00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:05.836
THE DIVISION WAS STATE

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:07.137
RESPONSIBILITY PLANS OTHER WE

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:08.872
HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THEM AND

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:10.207
OVER 20% WITH FEDERAL

00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:12.242
RESPONSIBLE SO THERE'S A HUGE

00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:14.778
IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:16.880
PROVIDE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:20.050
PROTECTION SERVICES FOR AREAS

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:21.585
THE FALL WITHOUT SORT OF SUMMER

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:23.286
JURISDICTION BECOMES OUT OF OUR

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:25.222
BUDGETS. AND AT THE SAME TIME

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.089
WE LOOK AT THE MUTUAL AID

00:50:26.156 --> 00:50:28.024
SYSTEM DEPENDING WHERE YOU ARE

00:50:28.091 --> 00:50:30.227
AND THE STATE 7080% OF THE

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:32.262
MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:34.030
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS A

00:50:34.097 --> 00:50:35.499
HUGE IMPACT I KNOW WE'RE NOT

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:36.266
HERE TO TALK ABOUT LOCAL

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:38.468
GOVERNMENT BUDGET BUT I CAN IT

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:41.838
NOT EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU. THE

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:42.873
IMPACT HAS A MY BUDGET. IN

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:45.675
RELATION TO TRYING TO. PROVIDE

00:50:45.742 --> 00:50:47.010
FIRE PROTECTION SERVICES TO

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:49.246
THE- THOSE THE COUNTY. WE HAVE

00:50:49.312 --> 00:50:50.747
A ROOM WITH CAL FIREBIRD IS NOT

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:52.516
REIMBURSE IS TO THE KNEADED

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:53.683
NEEDS TO BE REIMBURSED. THE

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:54.684
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A

00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:55.318
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:57.087
CONVERSATION AND THEN THE

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:58.588
THOUGHT AN IDEA THAT WE COULD

00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:00.690
POTENTIALLY. TO MUTILATE

00:51:00.757 --> 00:51:01.191
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:03.026
CALIFORNIA BUT- MIGHT NOT GET

00:51:03.093 --> 00:51:04.661
REIMBURSED. WE DID I CAN'T

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:06.696
SPEAK TO THAT- BUT IT'S A HUGE

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:09.599
PART OF TIMES MY ORGANIZATION-

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:11.368
I WILL CONCLUDE. ARM MY

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:12.669
COMMENTS BECAUSE MOST OF THEM

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:15.305
WERE SAID BY CHEAPER RUN TO AND

00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:18.675
THEN READ THE REPORT. ON THAT

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:21.178
FOR A LATER CONSTRUCTION WE DO

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:23.013
HAVE A AFTER ACTION REVIEW THAT

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:25.182
UNDER EMPLOYMENT IN THE COUNTY

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:26.483
OF LOS ANGELES. I WAS REGARD

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:28.718
FAR APART. A LOT OF IT IN

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:30.854
RELATION TO- PUBLIC EDUCATION

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:31.788
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:34.057
IS THAT. WE REALLY DID A BETTER

00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:35.659
READY SET GO PROGRAM TO REALLY.

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:37.394
GIVE OUR SERVICE MORE PICTURES

00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:41.231
AND MORE DESCRIPTION. ABOUT

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:42.566
EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED TO DO

00:51:42.632 --> 00:51:43.600
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:44.601
PROTECT THE HOME. AND ADVANCE

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:46.536
OF A MAJOR AIR. IN AFTER THE

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:48.405
INCIDENT TO NOT WAIT FOR THE

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:49.906
EVACUATION ORDER TO LEAVE

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:51.842
EARLY. ONE OF THE CHOICES THAT

00:51:51.908 --> 00:51:53.944
WE DID FIND AS WITH THE

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:56.012
EVACUATION. WHEN THERE'S A OR

00:51:56.079 --> 00:52:01.384
OUT. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO GET

00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:02.819
MESSAGE OUT. SO PHONES DON'T

00:52:02.886 --> 00:52:04.321
WORK YOUR BONES DON'T WORK

00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:06.289
RADIOS DON'T WORK TV IS NOT

00:52:06.356 --> 00:52:07.891
WORKING IN SOME INSTANCES AS

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.459
ANOTHER CONVERSATION BUT WE

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:11.728
HAVE MULTIPLE. OF WATER

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:13.063
PURVEYORS INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA

00:52:13.129 --> 00:52:15.265
DON'T HAVE WATER OR POWER THE

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:17.000
MERSEY BACKUP. SO IN MANY

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:18.168
INSTANCES ARE FIREFIGHTERS IN

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:20.170
SITUATIONS WHEN THE POWER GOES

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:20.937
UP THEY DON'T HAVE WATER WHICH

00:52:21.004 --> 00:52:23.206
IS THE FIREFIGHTERS BEST FRIEND

00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:24.074
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPLEX

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.709
ISSUES THAT WE WERE ALSO.

00:52:25.775 --> 00:52:27.110
DEALING WITH IN RELATION TO

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:28.512
THIS AND TO THE- BUT I WILL

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:32.082
CONCLUDE WITH THIS IS THAT.

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:34.084
WERE APPRECIATIVE OF YUBA THE

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.019
PRE POSITIONING UNITS TO HELP

00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:37.621
WE WERE ABLE TO ALLOCATE THOSE

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:40.056
OVER TO THE HELLFIRE- WE DO

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:40.490
HAVE AN OUTSTANDING

00:52:40.557 --> 00:52:42.425
RELATIONSHIP SO WHEN THE FIRED

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:43.793
THE BEGINNING VENTURA COUNTY

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:14.637
REMARKABLE. SO I JUST WANTED TO

01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:16.406

AND I SAID OH MAN. THERE ARE.

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:38.861
THIS IS THE PASSED THE WAR FOR

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:40.530
THE FIRST THIRTY. SIX HOURS ON

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:41.898
THE WAS A FIRE. WHICH I

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:43.099
COULDN'T STAND WHERE AND MANY

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.667
MORE. AND GOT ITEM. AN

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.536
APPARTEMENT TODAY JUST TO DRIVE

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:48.037
SOME MOTIVATION TO THINK ABOUT

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:49.639
WHAT THOSE FIRST THIRTY SIX

01:01:49.705 --> 01:01:51.641
HOURS WERE LIKE. WE HAD NO REST

01:01:51.707 --> 01:01:52.975
WE HAD NO FOOD WE HAD NO WATER

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:54.410
WE WERE SELF CONTAINED AND WE

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:56.345
WERE GOING FROM. HOUSE TO HOUSE

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:57.113
FROM NEIGHBORHOOD TO

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.115
NEIGHBORHOOD. CARRYING PEOPLE

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:00.083
OUT ON OUR BACKS GETTING THEM

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:02.385
OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS. AND

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:03.986
FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS OR MORE

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:04.620
THERE WAS NO RELIEF BECAUSE WE

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.823
DID NOT HAVE BODIES WE DID NOT

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.057
HAVE ENGINES WE DID NOT HAVE

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:10.093
RESOURCES TO ROTATE OUT. AND

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.195
EVERYBODY STAYED ON THE LINE

01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:13.763
AND DID A GOOD JOB. ALONG THOSE

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.631
LINES LATER IN THE FIRE WHEN I

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:17.834
PUT ON MY UNION HAT. I GOT TO

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.936
RUN THE PEER SUPPORT TRAILER AT

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:20.570
THE CAMP AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:21.771
WERE RESOURCE DOUBT.

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.573
FIREFIGHTERS WHO RAN ON THE

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:25.575
BORDERLINE SHOOTING IN FACT.

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:26.909
PACKED THEIR GEAR AND ONE ON

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.277
THE FIRE WITHOUT A MINUTE TO

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.812
GRIEVE. THEY STARTED GRIEVING

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.914
ABOUT TWO WEEKS INTO THE FIRES

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:33.783
AND WE HAD TO DO WITHOUT. BUT

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.551
THE FIRE CHIEF CALLED ME SAID.

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:37.587
WE'RE OUT OF ENGINES BUT WE GOT

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:41.557
BODIES. WHAT CAN WE DO AND WE

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:44.227
WERE THINKING ABOUT IT AND- IT

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:46.229
CAME TO US IN A CONVERSATION. I

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.264
THINK WE'RE OVER TIRED. I SAID

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.499
WELL THE BODIES ARE GETTING

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:51.167
TIRED THE ENGINES IN THE

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:52.668
EQUIPMENT. THEY CAN KEEP

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:55.238
RUNNING. WHAT IF WE LEFT

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:58.541
ENGINES IN PLACE AND WE PUT TWO

01:02:58.608 --> 01:02:59.475
SHIFTS OF FIREFIGHTERS PER

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:00.877
ENGINE. AND WE JUST STARTED

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:02.812
ROTATING A MOUNTAIN CAMP WE

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:03.980
HAVE THREE SHIFTS ON THE

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:05.615
DEPARTMENT SO SENSUAL AT THAT

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:09.752
POINT ONE SHIFT COVERED ALL THE

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:10.319
AREAS THAT WE STILL HAD TO

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:12.121
PROTECT. IN THE LA COUNTY AREAS

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:16.292
SOME MASSIVE. TWO THOUSAND. WAS

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:19.228
IT THANK YOU IT'S A IT'S A

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:20.897
LARGER VOTE COUNT AND WE HAD TO

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.299
PUT OUT ONE SHIFT IN THE

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:25.201
STATIONS AND THEY STAYED THERE

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:28.171
FOR TWO WEEKS OR OR LONGER AND

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:30.806
THEN WE TOOK OUR OTHER TWO

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:33.176
SHIFTS AND WE ASSIGN THAT. AND

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:34.644
IF I AM THEM TO THE- TWO SHIPS

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:35.711
THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:38.147
AND OUR AGENCY AND WE WERE ABLE

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:40.583
TO ROTATE THE WORKERS ON TO THE

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.218
MACHINES AND BE MORE EFFECTIVE

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:44.453
IF WE HAD MORE PENSIONS. WE

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.321
COULD PUT THOSE FIREFIGHTERS IN

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:47.757
SERVICE A FEW OTHER THINGS I'M

01:03:47.823 --> 01:03:49.058
GONNA STAY AYE ORNAMENTAL

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:51.027
VEGETATION ARE YOU HERE FROM

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:53.796
SOME FIRE PREVENTION TODAY THEY

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:55.331
DO AMAZING WORK OUT THERE ON

01:03:55.398 --> 01:03:57.533
WOODS IN ORDINANCES WE'VE DONE

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.001
A GREAT JOB OF PULLING PEOPLE

01:03:59.068 --> 01:04:00.803
TO CLEAR THEIR ERROR. OF

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:04.073
NATURAL VEGETATION TO PROVIDE-

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.576
BUFFER FOR THE FIRES AND TO

01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:07.877
HAVE A PLAN TO LEAVE WITH DONE

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:09.445
GREAT. AND THEN WE'VE ALLOWED

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.681
THEM TO PLANT STICKS OF

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:13.216
DYNAMITE. IN THEIR PLANNERS

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:15.418
SURROUNDING THE HOUSES AND WHEN

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:15.885
YOU SEE THE ORNAMENTAL

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:17.920
VEGETATION GO UP. IT'S AMAZING

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:19.422
ALL THIS GOOD STUFF IN PLACE

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:20.556
AND THE ORNAMENT OF IT

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:22.258
VEGETATION. CAN TAKE OUT A

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:24.660
HOUSE BECAUSE IT IGNITES MORE

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:25.861
READILY THAN EVEN THE NATURAL

01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:26.862
VEGETATION SO SOME THOUGHTS

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:28.264
ABOUT THAT I THINK ARE

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:30.132
IMPORTANT. THE OTHER THING IS

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:31.734
ON ORDERING- THAT THIS ORDERING

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:33.869
SYSTEM BACK AT THE STATION FAR

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:35.304
WE HAVE COOPERATING AGENCIES

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:36.272
AND YOU'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:37.540
ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO COOPERATE

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:39.175
LOCALLY AND WE DO THAT WE GET

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:39.976
ON THE PHONES WE SHARE

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.011
RESOURCES. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:44.814
ONE AGE ZERO FIVE PARTS. AND

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.883
THAT FIRE IS BY IN DIRECT OF

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:52.154
OTHER A- WHETHER MINUTE. OR A

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:59.562
THE DIRECTION BUT AND STATE. OR

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:04.433
FOR AREA. WE HAVE A FIVE

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:13.276
COMMAND. AND IT'S FRUSTRATING

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:15.111
TO HAVE DECISIONS BE MADE

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:16.846
SOMETIMES WITHOUT THAT INPUT.

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:18.347
AND IN FACT WE THINK AT THE

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:19.949
STATION FIRE HAD WE BEEN ABLE

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:21.384
TO GET MORE STATE RESOURCES-

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.219
FROM US FOREST SERVICE IN

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:25.655
AIRCRAFT AND- THINK OF THE WORD

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:27.223
THAT YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY.

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:29.458
WE WERE COMPETING FOR SIR THIS.

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:30.826
IS AMAZING THAT WE HAVE A

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:33.729
SYSTEM. THAT WE HAVE TO COMPETE

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:36.932
A COMPETITION. FOR RESOURCES

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:38.634
BETWEEN EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM.

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.903
THAT MEANS SOMEBODY'S GONNA WIN

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:42.705
AND SOMEBODY'S GOING TO LOSE

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.507
AND THE PEOPLE THAT LOSE ON THE

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:45.775
COMPETITION IF THEY'RE FACING

01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:48.911
AN INCIDENT THAT HITS THE LIVES

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:49.478
AND PROPERTY ARE GOING TO BE

01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:52.315
LOST. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:54.617
WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU IS THAT.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.552
THE PRE POSITIONING MONEY. I'VE

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:58.387
BEEN A PRETTY TESTIFIED THAT TO

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:00.690
A GOD SEND OF A PLAN. WE ARE

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:03.092
STILL IN PRE RECESSION STAFFING

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:04.860
LEVELS.WE'VE CLIMBED OUT OF

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:06.162
THE RECESSION WE BUILT OUR

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:09.665
ECONOMIES BACK THE STATE IS

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.701
HEALTHIER WE NEED TO RE EXAMINE

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:13.502
RESOURCES. STAFF WHAT. AND THE

01:06:13.569 --> 01:06:15.838
MONEY. IN THE POSITION MONEY. A

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:18.607
BACK TO PRE RECESSION LEVELS SO

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.376
THAT MUNICIPAL AGENCIES

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:22.011
CALIFORNIA THE FORRESTER. IN

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:25.781
FACT CAN PARTICIPATE ROBUSTLY

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:27.416
IN THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WHEN

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.085
YOU HAVE SMALL MUNICIPAL

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:29.919
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE SENDING

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:32.154
THE RESOURCES OUT EVEN LARGE

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:35.124
AGENCIES WE CAN'T DO THAT IF WE

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:36.892
DON'T GET REIMBURSEMENT WE

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:39.261
CAN'T DO THAT IF WE DON'T KNOW

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:41.797
IT OTHER AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:43.199
TO BACK FILL OUR- MYSTIC INS.

RESIDENTS AND HOMEOWNERS IN

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:42.510
THIS PROCESS AND THERE WAS

01:34:42.576 --> 01:34:43.677
NOTHING MORE CLEAR THAN THEN

01:34:43.744 --> 01:34:44.845
THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE WALLS

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:48.182
FIRE WE KNEW THAT IT WAS REAL.

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:49.817
FUNDAMENTALLY A BEING LIFE AT

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:51.252
THE POINT WHEN WE COULD ON HOW

01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:52.987
THAT FIRE WAS MOVING WE SAW IT

01:34:53.054 --> 01:34:54.822
AGAIN. IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:56.891
WE HAD THE TECH FIRE WE HAVE

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:58.859
THE SADDLE RIDGE FIRE WE THE

01:34:58.926 --> 01:35:00.728

LEAVE THEIR HOMES WE WERE A

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:07.001
LITTLE BIT BETTER AT THIS TIME.

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:08.202

01:35:08.269 --> 01:35:09.770
STILL GLITCHES AND TO THAT. I

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:11.605

TO DO THESE AFTER REPORTS TO

01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:16.911
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DO BETTER

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:19.313
NEXT TIME. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.649

IS GOING TO WORK ANY THAN ROSS

02:00:09.936 --> 02:00:12.171
I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER TODAY

02:00:12.238 --> 02:00:13.839

02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:30.790
AT LEAST FROM QUE FIRES FOR. WE

ABLE TO RELAY INFORMATION BACK

CAN EXTRACT THE ORDER OF THE

02:00:58.784 --> 02:01:00.686
PIECE OF SOFTWARE SO THE

02:01:00.753 --> 02:01:02.655

CONVERSATION SAID I. WAS

02:34:50.914 --> 02:34:53.183
HEARING EARLIER IS THAT. THOSE

02:34:53.250 --> 02:34:55.219
INITIAL MOMENTS THOSE INITIAL

02:34:55.285 --> 02:34:57.921
FIRST FEW HOURS. ARE WHERE THE

02:34:57.988 --> 02:35:01.792
DELAY IS AND- THAT'S- ONE OF

02:35:01.859 --> 02:35:02.826
THE AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO

02:35:02.893 --> 02:35:06.764
CLOSE IT OUT. THE AYE THE- I. I

02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:08.465
COAST WHATEVER THE AYE ROQUE

02:35:08.532 --> 02:35:12.369
IROC SYSTEM- REPLACING THE ROSS

02:35:12.436 --> 02:35:14.605
SYSTEM IS WHAT I GUESS WERE

02:35:14.672 --> 02:35:16.840
HOPING IS GOING TO WORK BUT-

02:35:16.907 --> 02:35:18.275
THAT'S THE SECOND PART OF MY

02:35:18.342 --> 02:35:19.810
QUESTION SO IF YOU COULD ANSWER

02:35:19.877 --> 02:35:22.279
THE FIRST PART. WHAT IS GOING

02:35:22.346 --> 02:35:23.747
TO BE THE LAW THE ROLE OF- YES

02:35:23.814 --> 02:35:25.315
IN TRYING TO REDUCE THAT TIME

02:35:25.382 --> 02:35:27.751
FRAME AND GET THE RESOURCES

02:35:27.818 --> 02:35:28.886
ALLOCATED FROM OTHER

02:35:28.952 --> 02:35:30.988
JURISDICTIONS TO HELP LOCALS AS

02:35:31.055 --> 02:35:33.390
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO IN THE

02:35:33.457 --> 02:35:36.093
CASE OF A WILDLAND FIRE IN THIS

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:38.429
IS JUST ONE FIRE THAT'S

02:35:38.495 --> 02:35:40.264
OCCURRING IN THE STATE. THE

02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:41.932
JURISDICTION BEGINS PLACING

02:35:41.999 --> 02:35:45.502
ORDERS IN THE OPERATIONAL AREA

02:35:45.569 --> 02:35:46.303
AND THOSE ARE TYPICALLY THE

02:35:46.370 --> 02:35:48.972
COUNTY. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE

02:35:49.039 --> 02:35:51.742
MULTIPLE OPERATIONAL AREAS IN

02:35:51.809 --> 02:35:54.712
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN REGION

02:35:54.778 --> 02:35:56.613
ONE AND THEN THE TAHOE BASIN.

02:35:56.680 --> 02:36:01.151
SO THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED LOCAL

02:36:01.218 --> 02:36:03.687
JURISDICTION TECH COUNTY WHICH

02:36:03.754 --> 02:36:05.689
SYSTEM WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:36:05.756 --> 02:36:07.424
PHARMACY MUTUAL AID SYSTEM TO

02:36:07.491 --> 02:36:10.561
GET HELP THANK YOU SO YOU ORDER

02:36:10.627 --> 02:36:12.563
OBVIOUSLY LOCAL JURISDICTION

02:36:12.629 --> 02:36:15.432
HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY IF THAT

02:36:15.499 --> 02:36:18.569
INCIDENT. EXCEEDS THEIR

02:36:18.635 --> 02:36:20.704
CAPABILITY THEY'RE GOING TO

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:22.406
THEY'RE SURROUNDING FIRE

02:36:22.473 --> 02:36:24.575
DEPARTMENTS FOR HELP RIGHT.

02:36:24.641 --> 02:36:25.442
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE CLOSEST

02:36:25.509 --> 02:36:28.212
AVAILABLE RESOURCE AS IT

02:36:28.278 --> 02:36:30.314
CONTINUES TO ESCALATE THEY'RE

02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:32.316
GOING TO THEIR LOCAL

02:36:32.382 --> 02:36:34.818
OPERATIONAL AREA THAT COUNTY IF

02:36:34.885 --> 02:36:37.387
YOU WILL FOR HELP AND RESOURCES

02:36:37.454 --> 02:36:40.491
ARE COMING. AS THE INCIDENT EEK

02:36:40.557 --> 02:36:42.626
SCAPES THAT INITIAL ATTACK AND

02:36:42.693 --> 02:36:45.062
BECOMES LARGER WE GO TO THE

02:36:45.129 --> 02:36:47.164
REGION THERE SIX REGIONS IN

02:36:47.231 --> 02:36:49.833
CALIFORNIA AND THOSE CLOSE IS

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:52.770
RESOURCES BEGIN THE RESPONDED

02:36:52.836 --> 02:36:56.140
INCIDENT. ONCE AT REGION IS

02:36:56.206 --> 02:36:58.208
TAPPED OUT AND THERE'S NO MORE

02:36:58.275 --> 02:37:00.744
RESOURCES AVAILABLE THEN IT

02:37:00.811 --> 02:37:02.946
COMES TO THE STATE. AND WE

02:37:03.013 --> 02:37:06.083
START. PUTTING RESOURCE REQUEST

02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:08.652
TO OTHER REGIONS. OBVIOUSLY

02:37:08.719 --> 02:37:11.355
AGAIN THE CLOSER THE RESOURCE

02:37:11.421 --> 02:37:13.857
THE QUICKER THE RESPONSE SO WE

02:37:13.924 --> 02:37:15.592
ARE TRYING TO MOVE RESOURCES

02:37:15.659 --> 02:37:19.396
QUICKLY. IT ALL GOES INTO A

02:37:19.463 --> 02:37:22.032
SYSTEM AS I MENTIONED THE FINAL

02:37:22.099 --> 02:37:24.535
HE GETS INTO THAT MIDDLE OF THE

02:37:24.601 --> 02:37:27.004
FINAL WORD THE WORD- IT SLOWS

02:37:27.070 --> 02:37:29.640
DOWN. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GIVE

02:37:29.706 --> 02:37:30.941
THAT INFORMATION TO A FIRE

02:37:31.008 --> 02:37:33.977
DEPARTMENT YOU CALL UP THE LA

02:37:34.044 --> 02:37:36.046
COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT YOU SAY

02:37:36.113 --> 02:37:38.482
I NEED A STRIKE TEAM OF FIRE

02:37:38.549 --> 02:37:41.084
ENGINES LA COUNTY MAY BE ABLE

02:37:41.151 --> 02:37:46.290
TO FILL IT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO

02:37:46.356 --> 02:37:48.425
FILL IT DEPENDING ON WHAT THE-

02:37:48.492 --> 02:37:51.895
BUSINESS. AND THEIR FIRE. THIS

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:55.165
USING THIS LIVE FOUR OH FIVE

02:37:55.232 --> 02:37:58.569
SYSTEM SO WE KNOW THAT LA

02:37:58.635 --> 02:38:01.538
COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE A STRIKE

02:38:01.605 --> 02:38:02.139
TEAM OF FIRE ENGINES AVAILABLE

02:38:02.206 --> 02:38:03.974
RIGHT NOW. SO WE DON'T EVEN

02:38:04.041 --> 02:38:05.642
HAVE TO GO TO LA COUNTY WE GO

02:38:05.709 --> 02:38:07.277
RIGHT TELL THE CITY BECAUSE WE

02:38:07.344 --> 02:38:09.646
KNOW THEY HAVE IT AVAILABLE. WE

02:38:09.713 --> 02:38:12.549
YES SIR IS WE THE LOCALS IT'S

02:38:12.616 --> 02:38:14.685
ANYBODY USING THE SYSTEM THIS

02:38:14.751 --> 02:38:16.753
SYSTEM IS NOT OVER YES

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:19.489
PROPRIETARY IT'S FOR THE SYSTEM

02:38:19.556 --> 02:38:22.192
SO THESE DISPATCH CENTERS. HAVE

02:38:22.259 --> 02:38:26.029
A- THEY CAN LOOK ON IT AND THEY

02:38:26.096 --> 02:38:28.031
KNOW WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THEIR

02:38:28.098 --> 02:38:29.933
SURROUNDING AREAS BECAUSE

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.802
THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR

02:38:31.869 --> 02:38:35.038
INFORMATION AND ALSO. SO DOES

02:38:35.105 --> 02:38:38.375
THAT CAN EXPLAIN HOW ORDERS

02:38:38.442 --> 02:38:40.377
MOVE THROUGH THE SYSTEM WELL IS

02:38:40.444 --> 02:38:41.879
THAT HOW THEY CURRENTLY DO

02:38:41.945 --> 02:38:42.746
BECAUSE CLEARLY WHAT'S

02:38:42.813 --> 02:38:44.748
CURRENTLY HAPPENING IS WORKING

02:38:44.815 --> 02:38:47.184
TOO SLOWLY AT LEAST AS I

02:38:47.251 --> 02:38:49.386
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT

02:38:49.453 --> 02:38:50.854
HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED THAT. WHAT

02:38:50.921 --> 02:38:53.991
THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS TOO SLOW

02:38:54.057 --> 02:38:55.993
AND IT TO AND I KNOW THAT IN A

02:38:56.059 --> 02:38:58.195
NUMBER OF FIRES IT'S TAKING WAY

02:38:58.262 --> 02:39:01.098
TOO LONG FOR THE AID TO COME TO

02:39:01.164 --> 02:39:02.299
THEM ONE SIX IT'S GREAT BUT

02:39:02.366 --> 02:39:05.702
THAT THAT KEY CRITICAL. WE MALL

02:39:05.769 --> 02:39:08.472
IS THE- SO BUILDING THE TELL

02:39:08.538 --> 02:39:12.409
MOM IS ASIAN UNIT AT O. S. TO

02:39:12.476 --> 02:39:13.944
TRY TO INCREASE THE STAFFING TO

02:39:14.011 --> 02:39:16.914
HELP MOBILIZE RESOURCES.

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:18.448
BECAUSE STAFFING IN THE REGION

02:39:18.515 --> 02:39:19.683
DISPATCH CENTERS AS WAS

02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:24.521
MENTIONED. IS ONE OF THE ISSUES.

02:39:24.588 --> 02:39:26.523
THIS VETS DISPATCH CENTERS ARE

02:39:26.590 --> 02:39:28.959
STAFFED BASED ON WHAT THEIR

02:39:29.026 --> 02:39:31.662
DAILY NEEDS ARE WHEN YOU HAVE A

02:39:31.728 --> 02:39:33.497
WOODLEY FIRE THAT'S NOT THE

02:39:33.563 --> 02:39:35.599
NORMAL STAFFING. THAT DISPATCH

02:39:35.666 --> 02:39:37.301
CENTER THAT NEEDS TO BE THERE

02:39:37.367 --> 02:39:39.102
SO WE'RE TRYING TO BOLSTER THAT

02:39:39.169 --> 02:39:42.439
RIGHT NOW AND IN THE PROPOSED

02:39:42.506 --> 02:39:45.475
BUDGET. TRANSACTION THAT THAT

02:39:45.542 --> 02:39:48.312
WILL HELP GET MORE DISPATCHERS

02:39:48.378 --> 02:39:49.980
TO HELP PROCESS ORDERS AND GET

02:39:50.047 --> 02:39:52.382
THEM MOVING SO THIS ARE A

02:39:52.449 --> 02:39:55.252
SYSTEM- I WAS VERY CONCERNED TO

02:39:55.319 --> 02:39:57.120
HEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN NO.

02:39:57.187 --> 02:39:59.389
TRAINING AT THIS POINT IN TIME

02:39:59.456 --> 02:40:01.358
FOR LOCALS AND THAT THE SYSTEM

02:40:01.425 --> 02:40:03.794
THERE'S GOING TO BE A WEEK GAPS

02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:05.662
SO WE ALL HAVE TO HOPE AND PRAY

02:40:05.729 --> 02:40:07.030
WE DON'T HAVE A MAJOR EVENT

02:40:07.097 --> 02:40:08.966
DURING. WE EXPLAIN TO THE

02:40:09.032 --> 02:40:11.702
PUBLIC. I GOT TO TELL YOU I AM.

02:40:11.768 --> 02:40:14.371
REALLY CONCERNED. THAT NOW WE

02:40:14.438 --> 02:40:17.174
KNOW. THAT THE AT LEAST IF THIS

02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:19.376
IS ACCURATE THAT WOULD WE

02:40:19.443 --> 02:40:20.677
HAVEN'T TRAINED ANY THE LOCALS.

02:40:20.744 --> 02:40:22.913
ON THE USE OF THE SYSTEM. AND

02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:24.147
THAT THERE'S A WEEK BETWEEN

02:40:24.214 --> 02:40:27.484
WHEN THE ROSS SYSTEM IS CLOSED

02:40:27.551 --> 02:40:29.720
IS TURNED OFF AND THE IRA AND

02:40:29.786 --> 02:40:33.290
THE IRAQ SYSTEM. IS IN PLACE

02:40:33.357 --> 02:40:35.292
COULD YOU PLEASE HELP. CLARIFY

02:40:35.359 --> 02:40:38.795
THAT SITUATION I MEAN IT'S SO.

02:40:38.862 --> 02:40:39.863
I KNOW THE FEDS OR SOMEONE

02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:42.132

NOT HERE AND I KNOW THE FEDS

02:40:45.102 --> 02:40:47.371
HAVE BEEN HELPFUL BUT- THESE

02:40:47.437 --> 02:40:49.473
ARE OUR FIRES WHO'S GOING TO BE

02:40:49.539 --> 02:40:51.808
AVAILABLE HOW WE GOING TO MAKE

02:40:51.875 --> 02:40:53.143
SURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS

02:40:53.210 --> 02:40:56.013
OPERATING THAT WE ARE HELP

02:40:56.079 --> 02:40:57.714

02:40:59.916 --> 02:41:01.018
NATIONAL AND FOR THAT ONE

02:41:01.084 --> 02:41:01.785
BECAUSE OPERATIONAL WE HAVE

02:41:01.852 --> 02:41:04.554
PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO USE IT.

02:41:04.621 --> 02:41:07.958
THANK YOU MADAM I SHARE- SO-

BROAD SPECTRUM OF HAVE AN ORDER

02:41:10.827 --> 02:41:13.296
IS PLACED. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

02:41:13.363 --> 02:41:15.599
THE TRANSITION. FROM ROSS THE

02:41:15.665 --> 02:41:16.700
IRAQ LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT GAP

02:41:16.767 --> 02:41:20.704
FIRST. SO EVERY CENTER SHOULD

02:41:20.771 --> 02:41:23.407
HAVE I WOULD HOPE WOULD HAVE A

02:41:23.473 --> 02:41:25.442
CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS PLAN.

02:41:25.509 --> 02:41:27.310
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE

02:41:27.377 --> 02:41:29.112
THEIR NINE ONE ONE CENTER IF

02:41:29.179 --> 02:41:30.947
THE POWER GOES OUT IF AN

02:41:31.014 --> 02:41:32.983
EMERGENCY HAPPENS THEY SHOULD

02:41:33.050 --> 02:41:36.420
HAVE A BACKUP PLAN. SO WHAT WE

02:41:36.486 --> 02:41:38.989
WOULD HOPE IS THAT SPECIFIC TO

02:41:39.056 --> 02:41:42.926
ROB US THAT EVERYBODY IS AWARE

OF CALIFORNIA. FIRST FOREMOST

02:41:51.401 --> 02:41:52.736
EVERY DISPATCH CENTER HAS A

02:41:52.803 --> 02:41:53.970
COMPUTED IT COMPUTER AIDED

02:41:54.037 --> 02:41:56.206
DISPATCH CENTER HAD HAD HS A

02:41:56.273 --> 02:41:58.875
COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH SYSTEM

02:41:58.942 --> 02:42:00.510
A CAD SYSTEM IF YOU WILL.

02:42:00.577 --> 02:42:02.145
THEY'RE ABLE TO DISPATCH THEIR

02:42:02.212 --> 02:42:04.681
RESOURCES AND IN SOME INSTANCES

02:42:04.748 --> 02:42:06.249
WHERE THOSE CATS SYSTEMS CAN

02:42:06.316 --> 02:42:07.984
TALK TO EACH OTHER THEY CAN

02:42:08.051 --> 02:42:10.020
TALK CROSS JURISDICTIONAL- AND

02:42:10.087 --> 02:42:12.089
