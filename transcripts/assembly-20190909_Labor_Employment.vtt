YOUR CONSTITUENTS. I KNOW IN

WORKERS AT DODGER STADIUM WHO

00:33:53.197 --> 00:33:54.699

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:56.267
WEEK YOU CAN DO DIRECTOR MAYBE

00:33:56.334 --> 00:33:58.503
A WEEK IF SEVENTY TWO HOURS IS

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:00.138
THAT TOUGH. FOR THE GIANTS THE

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:02.774
DODGERS MAKE IT A WEEK. BUT I

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.108
STILL THINK THEY COULD DO IN

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:05.243
TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF THEY HAVE

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:05.777
TO THEY CAN EVEN DO IT

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:07.345
IMMEDIATELY AND COMPLY WITH THE

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:09.180
LAW. THE FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:11.716
A TRADITION FOR ALL THESE YEARS

00:34:11.783 --> 00:34:13.985
NOT TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW.

00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:16.120
DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT. DOESN'T

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:18.790
MAKE IT CORRECT. I UNDERSTAND

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:19.957
THAT LABOR AND MANAGEMENT OF

00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:22.760
GOT ALONG FOR YEARS ALLOWING

00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:24.429
THIS TO HAPPEN. THEY MAY HAVE

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:26.798
HAD MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO

00:34:26.864 --> 00:34:27.698
BUT THE REALITY IS THESE

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:30.535
WORKERS NEED THEIR MONEY. THEY

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:32.203
NEED THEIR MONEY WOULD BE NICE

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.871
TO GET A TOMB SOONER RATHER

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:35.106

00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:37.175
THEIR BILLS THEIR CREDIT CARD

00:34:44.782 --> 00:34:50.121
TWO WEEKS. AND THAT'S WITH THE

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:51.222
BILL ALLOWS IN THIS LABOR CO

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:52.256
TWO OH FORCE RIGHT I URGE YOU.

00:34:52.323 --> 00:34:53.624
THINK VERY HARD ABOUT THIS. AND

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:54.725
THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOUR

00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:58.196
CONSTITUENTS ARE INVOLVED. AND

00:34:58.262 --> 00:34:58.763
MAYBE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.865
TABLE ISN'T STUDY THE- AND IT'S

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.300

PAY THEM IMMEDIATELY. BUT IT

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.051

COMMENTS THAT'S THE RUMOR

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.332
GONZALEZ. I THINK I'M USING

00:35:34.398 --> 00:35:36.734
YEARS I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:37.301
YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE ANSWER

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:38.903
NINE IN. I LITERALLY DON'T KNOW

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:44.108
THE ANSWER ARE CSEA EMPLOYEES.

00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:44.709
AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR

00:35:44.775 --> 00:35:46.377
ARE THEY IS THERE TIME GIVEN.

00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:51.916
DOES ANYONE NOW. I WAS JUST

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:54.719
CURIOUS BECAUSE IT IS SOMEWHAT.

00:35:54.785 --> 00:35:57.154
SIMILAR REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES

00:35:57.221 --> 00:36:00.157
WHO KIND OF HAVE A DIFFERENT

00:36:00.224 --> 00:36:04.228
EXPECTATION AND AN END THERE

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:06.030
BECAUSE THEY TECHNICALLY LOSE

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:09.066
THEIR JOB EVERY YEAR BASICALLY

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:10.668
ANYWAY JUST A CURIOSITY OF HOW

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:11.369
HOW THEY'RE DEALT WITH I

00:36:11.435 --> 00:36:13.638
THOUGHT I THOUGHT THAT THEY

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:14.939
WERE ON A REGULAR PAY SCHEDULE

LIGHTS AS THE LEAST

00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:58.569

THAT TECHNOLOGY IS BY IS FREE

00:44:41.879 --> 00:44:44.214

SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND I'LL

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:11.969
JUST. TO US ARGUES OFFICES

00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:13.937
POINT FIRST OF ALL I THINK OF

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:16.073
THE ELECTED OFFICIALS IN.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:16.840
SILICON VALLEY I PRICE SPEAK

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:21.612
MORE TO. HIRING DISPARITIES OF

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:23.013
PEOPLE OF COLOR PARTICULARLY

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.181
KNOWS AFTER AMERICANS AND OF

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:25.349
WOMEN. MORE VOCALLY PROBABLY

00:46:25.415 --> 00:46:27.451
THAN ALMOST ANYONE AND SO THIS

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:28.519
IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:30.988
ME. BEING IN SILICON VALLEY AND

00:46:31.054 --> 00:46:32.623
I THINK ALL OF US CERTAINLY ON

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:34.391
THIS PANEL. ON THE SEARCH

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:36.460
COMMITTEE. BUT I DO SHARES A

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:37.728
HEALTHY DOSE OF CYNICISM AS

00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:39.830
WELL AS TO WHETHER TECHNOLOGY

00:46:39.897 --> 00:46:41.765
IS THE IS THE SOLUTION TO IT.

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:43.534
BUT I'M CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.368
LEARNING MORE AND I THINK THAT

00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:45.802
THIS. IF THIS IF THIS IS A WAY

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:47.571
FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD AND

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:49.373
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY I THINK IT

00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:52.075
CAN BE A TOOL AGAIN I AGREE

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:52.643
THAT WE DON'T NESTLE ONE OF

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:54.178
DAYS OUT. A CERTAIN SECTOR OF

00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:55.679
EMPLOYMENT BUT IF THIS CAN BE A

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:57.714
TOOL. TO HELP DEAL WITH ARE

00:46:57.781 --> 00:47:01.318
IMPLICIT BIASES. THAT'S WHAT

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:02.986
I'M INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE

00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:04.888
ABOUT AND SOME BOX NATIVE IN

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:08.926
THIS. AREA I IN TERMS OF THE

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:10.494
CAPACITY OF SOFTWARE BUT I DO

00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:12.029
ALSO SHARE SOME OF THE CYNICISM

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:13.063
IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO DO

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:20.370
IT BECAUSE THE INPUTS. ARE.

00:47:20.437 --> 00:47:20.904
STILL BEING PUT. QUITE IS

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:25.943
DETERMINED. TO HAVE THOSE SAME

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.311
BIASES AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:47:27.377 --> 00:47:28.745
LEARNING MORE. AND I THINK THAT

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:29.179
THIS IS DEFINITELY A

00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:29.913
CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.681
AND I DEFTLY SUPPORT THE END

00:47:30.747 --> 00:47:31.782
GOAL OF WHAT THE REAL

00:47:31.848 --> 00:47:32.749
RESOLUTION IS SEEKING AND SO

00:47:32.816 --> 00:47:34.585
FOR THAT REASON I SUPPORT IT.

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:35.219
AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:40.257
WORK AT. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:41.291

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:47.464
COME UP WITH WE A AYE

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:50.133
TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD DOESN'T

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.136
TURN INTO A NIGHTMARE. I CAN

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:53.904

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:54.972
ESPECIALLY SUPPOSED JUST BE A

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:56.506
TOOL FOR HUMAN RESOURCE PEOPLE

00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:57.741
NOT TO REPLACE THEM THIS IS

00:47:57.808 --> 00:47:58.575

WEEDED OUT THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:05.882
TO BE THE BE ALL AND END ALL IS

00:48:05.949 --> 00:48:07.718
NOT THE ULTIMATE ANSWER IT IS

00:48:07.784 --> 00:48:09.353
JUST A TOOL TO SOMEONE CAN USE

00:48:09.419 --> 00:48:11.188
