COMMITTEE ALL THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. OF THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE CONDUCTING TODAY -- TO HEAR FROM THE CHAIR ON THE NINE OH ONE COMMISSION ALSO KNOWN AS CATASTROPHIC WELL FIRE COST RECOVERY. A COMMISSION -- TO GIVE US SORT OF A PRELIMINARY A READ ON THERE. ARE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE THEY WILL BE VOTING ON LATER THIS WEEK -- AS A COMMITTEE WHERE -- HERE TODAY -- REALLY TO HEAR THE REPORT -- BUT ALSO. TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INQUIRE AROUND SOME OF THE ASPECTS OF THE DIRECTION THAT. THE COMMISSION -- SEEMS TO BE MOVING IN AND TO GIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS TO A TO DIALOGUE AROUND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CERTAINLY THOSE -- THE DIRECTION THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED. AND THEN WILL -- LOOK TO THE PUBLIC AND TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT -- BUT THIS WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS COMMISSION OR THIS COMMITTEE. OUGHT TO BE COME A LITTLE BIT MORE FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTS SOME OF THEM. ARE NEW -- THAT WE HAVE HEARD PREVIOUSLY -- BUT SOME I THINK WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN OUR THINKING SO WILL APPRECIATE HEARING FROM. OF THOSE WHO ARE HERE TO PRESENT I I'D LIKE. TO HOW TO CALL AFFORD A COMMISSIONER AND CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION OUR CARLA PETERMAN SHE IS THE CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION ON CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. COST AND RECOVERY -- WILL ALSO AND YOU CAN JOIN US HERE -- WE ALSO -- WILL HAVE -- MICHAEL KAHN WHO WAS -- OF ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS WHO WAS PART. OF THE UTILITY WHILE FAR LIABILITY. PORTION THERE IS A SECTION THAT'S DEALING WITH INSURANCE -- BUT THIS COMMISSION THIS COMMITTEE -- IT'S A IT'S OUTSIDE OF OUR JURISDICTION PER SE AND SO WE'RE GOING TO JUST FOCUS ON THE OVERVIEW. WHICH MADAM CHAIR YOU'LL BE ABLE TO A HIGHLIGHT -- BUT THEN WILL ALSO GO A LITTLE DEEPER -- WITH MR KHAN IF THAT'S NECESSARY ON THE A UTILITY WELL FIRE LIABILITIES SO IF THE BOTH OF YOU WILL JOIN US -- AND THEN WE ALSO WELCOME -- EVAN JOHNSON WHO'S EXECUTIVE OFFICER. COMMISSION ON CATASTROPHIC WHILE FOR COST RECOVERY. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION -- THIS AFTERNOON. I'M GOING TO ALSO NOTE THAT WE AS THE YOU IN A COMMITTEE. OF BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SUCH A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH. OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEES OF THE CONFEREES. OF FROM THE ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR WORKING CLOSELY. WITH THE SENATE ON THE NINE A ONE LEGISLATION -- THAT WE HAVE A COUPLE MEMBERS WHO WILL JOIN US IN A DOCTOR WOULD IS ONE WHO IS A MEMBER OF OF THE CONFEREES AND WE ALWAYS WELCOME HIM. TO BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION SO YOU HAVE THE FULL COMMITTEE BUT YOU ALSO HAVE. THE VALUE OF TALKED WITH HERE'S WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE HOLDEN AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INVITING MYSELF. MY FELLOW NOT A ONE COMMISSION COMMISSIONER MICHAEL KAHN AND OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER EVAN JOHNSON TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE IN BRIEFING ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE NINE A ONE COMMISSION. SOMEONE TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE NINE A ONE COMMISSION THE PROCESS WE'VE HAD TO DATE. AS WELL AS DETAIL AT THE DRAFT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE COMMITTEE RELEASED LAST WEEK. SO THE NINE OH ONE COMMISSION. IS THE RESULT OF SENATE BILL NINE A ONE PASSED LAST YEAR. AND THAT SENATE BILL -- ORDERED THE CREATED OVER CREATION OF A COMMISSION WITH FIVE APPOINTEES. ONE FROM THE ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER PAGE -- NAVA BECAUSE OF THIS CHAIR OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. ONE APPOINTEE FROM THE SENATE DR MICHAEL LARA WHO IS A PROFESSOR AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND AN EXPERT ON A UTILITY AND INSURANCE ISSUES. AND THREE APPOINTMENTS FROM THE GOVERNOR. MYSELF A FORMER C. P. U. C. M. C. C. COMMISSIONER. MICHAEL KAHN I IN A LONG TERM EXPERT ON ENERGY ISSUES AND ENERGY UTILITY ATTORNEY. AND THEN FINALLY FORMER INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DAVE JONES. THE COMMISSION IS SUBJECT TO OPEN MEANING ACT REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE DISCUSS AND COORDINATE ONLY IN PUBLIC MEETINGS. WE ARE SUPPORTED BY EXCELLENT STAFF AT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. AS WELL AS SUPPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND WE THANK ALL THREE OF THOSE AGENCIES FOR THEIR SUPPORT DURING THIS PROCESS. THE NINE OH ONE LEGISLATION FOCUS THE COMMISSION ON ISSUES RELATED TO WILDFIRES ASSOCIATED WITH UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ASK FOR RECOMMENDATIONS TO LAW THAT WOULD INSURE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF COSTS. AMONG AFFECTED PARTIES. AT OUR FIRST MEETING WE FURTHER REFINED OUR SCOPE TO FOCUS ON THREE AREAS. FIRST OF THE ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT STATUS OF UTILITY LIABILITY AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF FINES. THE SECOND THE IMPACT ON THE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL INSURANCE MARKETS. AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS. AND THIRD RECOMMENDATIONS ON A FUNDING MECHANISM TO ASSIST IN PAYMENT OF DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. WE'VE HAD A VERY PUBLIC PROCESS -- SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. WITH HELD A SERIES OF FOUR PUBLIC MEETINGS. AND WE HAVE OUR LAST PUBLIC MEETING THIS FRIDAY IN SACRAMENTO. OUR FOR MEETINGS HAVE BEEN AROUND THE STATE WE MET IN SACRAMENTO. REDDING SANTA ROSA AND VICTORIA. WE IN PARTICULAR CHOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY WILDFIRES AND MADE SURE WE HEARD TESTIMONY AND INFORMATION FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND WHILE FIRE VICTIMS IN THOSE AREAS. IN EACH MEETING IN ADDITION TO TAKING PUBLIC TESTIMONY WE ALSO CONVENE EXPERT PANELS. INCLUDING WILDFIRE VICTIMS UTILITIES BOTH INVESTOR OWNED AND PUBLICLY OWNED RATE PAYER ADVOCATES BUSINESS OWNERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I NEED TO THE MEETINGS FOCUSED ON ONE OF THE SUB TOPICS WITHIN SCOPE. AND WE USE ALL THAT INFORMATION TO INFORM OUR DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS. WE ALSO INVITED WRITTEN COMMENT ON ISSUES IN SCOPE AND RECEIVED THIRTY SEVEN SETS OF COMMENTS FROM A RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS. WHICH WILL PROVIDE TO THE LEGISLATURE WHEN WE TRANSMIT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. SO WE RELEASED OUR DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS LAST WEEK. OUR REPORT DRAFTING WAS SPLIT UP INTO THREE WORK GROUPS DUE TO BAGLEY KEENE RESTRICTIONS. THE WORKGROUPS NEARED THREE AREAS OF FOCUS SO WE HAVE THE LIABILITY WORK GROUP WHICH INCLUDED MICHAEL KAHN PAGE -- NAVA. THE FUNDING MECHANISM GROUP WHICH INCLUDED MYSELF AND MICHAEL LARA. ANY INSURANCE GROUP WHICH INCLUDED DAVE JONES AND MICHAEL WAR. STAFF FROM OPR TOOK THESE THREE SEPARATE PRODUCTS AND WROTE THE DRAFT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY IN ATTEMPT TO INTEGRATE THEM. THE FINAL SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS POSTED LAST WEEK WERE NOT SEEN BY ALL THE COMMISSIONERS UNTIL THEY WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. SO THIS FRIDAY WILL BE OURFIRST AND ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE DIRECT FEEDBACK WITH EACH OTHER ON THE SUB RECOMMENDATIONS. AS WELL AS GIVE FEEDBACK REGARDING THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND HOW IT INTEGRATES THOSE THREE CHAPTERS TOGETHER. SO I'M NOW GOING TO DETAIL THE DRAFT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT. AND MYSELF AND MISTER CONNOR HERE TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AROUND OUR SUBSECTIONS AS WELL AS A REFERENCE ANY OTHER MATERIAL THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. SO OVERALL OUR FINDINGS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT. WITH THE STRIKE TEAMS FINDINGS THAT THE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE INCREASES PLUS THE INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA POPULATION. HAVE PLAYED A DIRECT ROLE IN FIRE THREAT. SO INDEED THE INFORMATION WE TOOK AND THAT SAY WE ARE IN THIS NEW NORMAL. WE ALSO FOUND THAT UTILITIES HAVE PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE IN CAUSING THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES AND MUST TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN MITIGATING RISK. WE CONCLUDED THAT SB NINE OH ONE DOES NOT DO ENOUGH TO MANAGE THE SYSTEMATIC RISK FROM WILDFIRES TO THE STATE'S MAJOR UTILITIES. AND THAT THE SOLUTIONS TO MORE ACTIVELY ALLOCATE COSTS ARE MORE BURDENSOME THE BIGGER THE LIABILITY SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON MEDICATION. AMONG ALL THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE. AT A HIGH LEVEL THE COMMISSIONERS ACROSS THE SUBGROUPS RECOMMEND THAT THE CURRENT STRICT LIABILITY APPLICATION INVERSE CONDEMNATION BE REPLACED. WITH A FOUGHT BASE STANDARD. WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THE CREATION OF A WILDFIRE VICTIMS CLAIMS PAYING FIND. AS WELL AS A SERIES OF REFORMS TO THE HOMEOWNER INSURANCE MARKET TO MAINTAIN AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE INSURANCE. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS CAN WORKING COORDINATION AND NONE ARE DIRECT SUBSTITUTES FOR EACH OTHER. MOREOVER WE ACKNOWLEDGE TO IMPLEMENTING ONE OR MORE OF THESE CAN IMPACT THE NEED AND THE SCOPE FOR SOME OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS. SOMEONE TO TAKE EACH SECTION IN TURN THE THREE SUBGROUPS. FOR THE LIABILITY WORKING GROUP THERE ARE THREE KEY FINDINGS. THE FIRST THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A DECENTRALIZING INCONSISTENT SYSTEM OF REGULATING AND GOVERNING UTILITY WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION. THE SECOND FINDING IS THAT THE CURRENT APPLICATION OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION AFFECTS THE VIABILITY OF THE STATE'S UTILITIES AND CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY AND WATER. THE THIRD IS THAT THE TIME REQUIRED FOR AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF WILDFIRE COST RECOVERY FROM REPAIRS REDUCES INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN UTILITIES AND LIMITS UTILITY ACCESS TO CAPITAL AFTER MAJOR FIRE. THE SAME FINDING WAS FOUND BY THE FUN GROUP AS WELL. SO THERE ARE THREE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE LIABILITY GROUP. FIRST AS I MENTIONED REPLACE THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD WITH A FAULT BASED STANDARD [inaudible] THE SECOND. ESTABLISH AN ELECTRIC UTILITY WILDFIRE BOARD TO GOVERN UTILITY WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION IN A SINGLE ENTITY SEPARATE FROM THE C. P. U. C.. AND THIRD THAT THE COST RECOVERY STANDARD BE MODIFIED. A FUN GROUP SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO HOW TO DO THIS IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. NESTLE TURN TO THE FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. FIRST WE FOUND THAT THE FINANCIAL MECHANISMS FOR PAYING FOR WILDFIRES ARE STREAMED AND NOT SUSTAINABLE. SECOND WILDFIRE RISK IS CREATED BY MULTIPLE PARTIES WHO SHOULD ALL BE INCENTIVIZE TO REDUCE THE RISK AND SHARE IN PAYING FOR WILD FIRE DAMAGES. THIRD CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC COSTS ARE INCREASING IN PARTICULAR DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN WHILE FIRE MITIGATION. AND FOURTH THE LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH WILDFIRES ARE CHALLENGING TO MODEL AND NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. SO OUR SUBGROUP HAT TWO CATEGORIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST IS ON COST RECOVERY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COST RECOVERY THE REASON THIS IS AN ISSUE? IS THAT GIVEN THE SIZE OF POTENTIAL WILDFIRE LIABILITIES. AND THE INABILITY OF THE UTILITY COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKET TO COVER THESE CLAIMS. UTILITIES WILL LIKE TO SEE MORE OBJECTIVE PREDICTABLE STANDARDS FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES PRUDENT BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE IF THEY EVEN GET ACTED PRUDENTLY THE MOST COST CAN BE RECOVERED FROM RATE PAYERS. THIS IS DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE GIVEN THE RELATIVE IN EXPERIENCE WE HAVE A CATASTROPHIC FIRES IN THE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO WILDFIRE COST AND DAMAGE. HOWEVER WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE REFORM OPTIONS THAT CAN BETTER STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF COST RECOVERY. AND ENSURING RATE PAYERS ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY ON THE HOOK FOR IMPRUDENTLY DERIVED COST. SO I SUB GROUP. PROVIDED THREE OPTIONS FOR REFORMING COST RECOVERY WHICH ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. THE FIRST OPTION IS SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF. AT OF IMPRUDENCE TO INTERVENE. THIS ALLOWS FOR PRESUMPTION OF PRUDENCE FOR UTILITY WILDFIRE EXPENSE. BUT STILL ALLOWS CHALLENGERS TO PROVE BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. THAT EXPENSE WAS IMPRUDENTLY OCCURRED. THIS IS THE STANDARD USED BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. I'LL NOTE THIS CHANGE IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT. AND IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN IS USED FOR OTHER TYPES OF COST RECOVERY. AS SUCH OF THIS THAT OPTION IS PURSUED ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO ENSURETHAT INTERFERES HAVE ACCESS TO THE RESOURCE AND DATA THEY NEED. TO LAUNCH A REASONABLE OFFENSE. THE SECOND OPTION WE RECOMMEND IS FURTHER REFINEMENT OF THESE SB NINE A ONE FACTORS THAT THE CPC SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN ASSESSING THIS ALLOWANCES. TO GIVE A HIGHER WAITING TO THOSE FACTORS THAT A KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIQUE EXHAUSTION A CIRCUMSTANCES POSSIBLY PRESENT IN A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. FOR EXAMPLE EXTREME WEATHER. AND IN OUR THIRD OPTION. IS ONE THAT PROPOSES A PREDETERMINED MAXIMUM LIABILITY BE SET. REGARDING -- SHAREHOLDER LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH A CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE. THIS PRE DETERMINED MAXIMUM LIABILITY WOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A WILDFIRE VICTIMS FINE. WHERE YOU CHIU UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS HAVE MADE A SUBSTANTIAL UP FRONT CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIND? SETTING THIS UP PREDETERMINED LEVEL FOR MAXIMUM LIABILITY COULD BE TIED TO A VARIETY OF METRICS SUCH AS MARKET CAPITALIZATION AND THAT IT COME. I KNOW THIS IS THE ONLY OPTION THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN ABSOLUTE CAP ON SHAREHOLDER EXPOSURE TO LIABILITIES. THE SECOND SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE WILDFIRE FROM GROUP NOT SURPRISING THE WELFARE FUND. I SO OVERALL WE PROPOSE A WILDFIRE VICTIMS FUN THAT WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO UTILITY COST CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. A FUND THAT IS BROADLY SOURCED INCLUDING FUNDING FROM SHAREHOLDERS RATE PAYERS AND PROPERTY OWNERS. SUCH A FUN WOULD SUPPORT LIQUIDITY AND CREATE A BUFFER AGAINST THE SHOCK OF LIABILITY COSTS FROM CATASTROPHIC FIRES FOR ANYONE GROUP. THIS RECOMMENDATION SUBCHAPTER HAS A LOT OF DETAIL IN IT BUT I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THAT DETAIL AT A HIGH LEVEL. THE SUB GROUP RECOMMENDS THAT THE PARTICIPATION BE VOLUNTARY FOR INVESTOR OWNED AND PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES. AND THAT THE FUNDING BE SUFFICIENTLY CAPITALIZED TO SURVIVE ANTICIPATED THIRD PARTY DAMAGES. UNDER A HIGHER EXPECTATION RISK FIRE SCENARIO. AND THEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE FUND BE SOURCED BOB BROADLY FROM CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SHAREHOLDERS RATE PAYERS -- AND PROPERTY OWNERS. AND PARTICULAR THAT THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS BE TIED TO ACTUAL RAIL BRISK SO THOSE UTILITIES THAT HAVE GREATER RISK FOR WILDFIRES WOULD PAY MORE. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE FUND BE CLAIMS PAYING. AND PAY UP TO A MAXIMUM AMOUNT FOR FIRE AND PER UTILITY. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE FUND SHOULD PAY CLAIMS WHEN THE UTILITY IS FOUND TO BE IMPRUDENT SO THAT WHILE FIRE VICTIMS GET PAID QUICKLY. BUT THAT A SPECIFIED AMOUNT WE GET REPAID BY THE UTILITY IF IT IS AN PRUDENT. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE FUN LAST AS LONG AS NECESSARY AND SHOULD BE REEVALUATED EVERY FIVE TO TEN YEARS. AND IF IS THE SIDE OF THE FUND IS NO LONGER NEEDED THAT THERE BE A PLAN TO WIND DOWN THE FIND. AND RETURN UNUSED CAPITAL TO ALL THE CONTRIBUTORS. OUR WORK GROUP HIGHLIGHTED SEVERAL CHALLENGES ESTABLISHING A FIND. AND I'LL JUST LIST THESE. ONE ON ONE CHALLENGE OF THE FUN IS THAT IN NOT PERVERSE LEE -- INCENTIVIZE RISKY BEHAVIOR BY UTILITIES AND HOMEOWNERS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE FOR EXAMPLE THAT PEOPLE GO OUT THERE AND GET ADEQUATE INSURANCE THAT UTILITIES DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AVOID. FIRES. HAVING THE PRESENCE OF A GUARANTEED FUNDING SOURCE CAN CREATES A PERVERSE INCENTIVE AND WE NEED TO WORK AROUND THAT. THE SECOND IS AGAIN THE POTENTIAL FOR CLAIMS TO GET INFLATED GIVEN THAT THERE'S GUARANTEED FUNDING. A THIRD CHALLENGES WITH SOURCING THE FUND INITIALLY AND PARTICULAR HOW TO GET CONTRIBUTIONS FROM P. JEANNIE. AS THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF A BANKRUPTCY. THERE'S ALSO A CHALLENGE WITH MAINTAINING PAY OUTS AT CURRENT SETTLEMENT VALUES -- CURRENTLY WILDFIRE AT VICTIMS INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL GET A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE ON THE DOLLAR WHEN THEY SETTLED IN COURT WITH THE UTILITIES. HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN SIMILAR LEVELS WITH THE FIND? AND THEN THERE'S THE OVERALL COURSE TURN ABOUT AFFORDABILITY FOR ASKING PROPERTY OWNERS AND REPAIRS TO CONTRIBUTE TO FIND. HOW DOES THAT? AFFECT THEM A FINANCIALLY. IN OUR PROCESS WE DO NOT GET CLEAR INPUT ABOUT HOW TO LEGISLATE OR DIRECTLY DEAL WITH THESE CHALLENGES AND SO WE WANTED TO RAISE THEM TO YOUR ATTENTION AS WELL AS THE ATTENTION OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. SO THEY CAN BRING A PROPOSALS TO YOU THAT ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. IF YOU DON'T ADDRESS ALL THESE CHALLENGES THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE NEEDED SIZE OF A FIND. WHICH HAS IMPLICATIONS AS WELL. AND THE FINALLY OUR WORKGROUP. NOTED THAT ABSENT CREATION OF A VICTIMS PAYING FIND REVISING THE COST RECOVERY STANDARD AND ESTABLISHING A LIQUIDITY FINE CAN'T PROVIDE BENEFITS. ALBEIT NOT THE BENEFITS A BROADER COST SOCIALIZATION. FINALLY WE ALSO COMMENTED ON THE C. P. U. C. FINE AUTHORITY. AND RE I RECOMMEND REVIEWING THEIR FINEST ALREADY TO ISSUE FINES FOR ANY VIOLATIONS AND ALTERING THE DISPOSITION OF THAT FINE REVENUE TO THE WILDFIRE VICTIMS FINE OR TOWARDS MITIGATION EFFORTS. AND THEN FINALLY OUR LAST CATEGORY RECOMMENDATIONS TO DEAL WITH INSURANCE. THE INSURANCE SUB GROUP FOUND THAT HOME INSURANCE IS BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO TEEN AND HIGH WILD FIRE RISK AREAS. RELATEDLY MORE HOMEOWNERS ARE HAVING TO PURCHASE FIRE INSURANCE FROM THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET OR FROM THE FAIR PLAN. WHICH IS THE STATE'S FIRE INSURANCE PLAN. THE HOME INSURANCE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT IN CRISIS YET AND AS SUCH THE GROUP DOES NOT RECOMMEND A NEW GOVERNMENT CREATED INSURANCE PROGRAM BEYOND THE FAIR PLAN. HOWEVER THE MARKET IS ON A PATH TOWARD BECOMING LESS AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE. THIS SUB GROUP RECOMMENDS MANY RECOMMENDATIONS. AND I'LL JUST GO THROUGH THEM IN TURN. ONE RECOMMENDATION IS THAT CALIFORNIA MAINTAIN INCENTIVES AT THE RISK BASE PRICING OF INSURANCE FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS. NEXT IMPROVE THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN AND THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION BY INCREASING THE CLAIMS CAP. THIRD REQUIRE FIRE RISK UNDERWRITING MODELS USE BIND SHORES TO BE FILED IN APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. AND REQUIRE ANNUAL FILING WITH CDI FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATING MODELS AND TOOLS. I'LL SAY MANY OF THESE ON RECOMMENDATIONS WERE ECHOED IN THE COMMENTS WE HEARD IN THE WILD FIRE VICTIMS ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY SAW WITH THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES A POST FIRES. THE NEXT RECOMMENDATIONS THE SET HOME FIRE RISK REDUCTION AND COMMUNITY RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS. OR REQUIRE INSURERS uIMPLEMENT A TIERED MITIGATION CREDIT BASED ON THE LEVEL OF HOME HARDENING. BASICALLY GIVE PEOPLE CREDIT FOR SECURING HARDENING THEIR HOME AGAINST WILDFIRES. ALSO REQUIRE INSURERS TO CALCULATE AND PROVIDE A REPLACEMENT HOUSING ESTIMATE. IN WRITING TO ENSURE IT ANNUALLY AND BEFORE ENTERING INTO AN ASSURANCE CONTRACT. AGAIN WE HEARD FROM ALL FIRE VICTIMS THAT THEY WERE UNDER INSURED WHEN THEY ALTERNATELY WENT TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES. IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT HOMEOWNERS ARE PREPARED. IT'S ALSO RECOMMENDATIONS REQUIRE THAT HOMEOWNERS INSURERS OFFER A ONE YEAR NOTICE OF NON RENEWAL IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INSTEAD OF THE FORTY FIVE DAY NOTICE. THAT HOMEOWNERS CURRENTLY GET. AND THEN FINALLY REQUIRE THAT THERE BE A VALLEY QUOTE FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE BEFORE ANY REAL ESTATE OFFER IS ACCEPTED. AS I MENTIONED I BELIEVE WE ALL FEEL THAT INVESTMENTS IN WILDFIRE RISK MITIGATION ARE IMPORTANT SO THE REPORT INCLUDES A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS ALONG THESE LINES. FIRST WE NEED TO MONITOR ACTIVITY AND HELP COORDINATE EVERYONE BETTER. SO ESTABLISH A WILDFIRE MON ABILITY RISK AND REDUCTION COORDINATOR WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. NEXT PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT STATE INVESTMENTS AND PREVENTION AND MITIGATION EFFORTS EVEN BEYOND THE FINDING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY AUTHORIZED. NEXT TAKE ACTIONS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE CONSISTENCY A PRIVATE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE LOS. NEXT REQUIRE THAT ANY MUNICIPALITY OR GOVERNMENT BODY THAT APPROVED NEW DEVELOPMENT IS ABLE TO PROVIDE FIRE FIGHTING SERVICE TO THAT PROPERTY WITHIN A CERTAIN MAXIMUM TIME. AND THEN LASTLY. THREE A DEVELOPMENT FEE FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND THE WILD FIRE URBAN INTERFACE. OUT WITH THAT THAT'S THE SUMMATION OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AS I MENTIONED REPORT HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TO STAND CHENEY TESTIMONY AND COMMENTS. WHICH WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE TO YOU AFTER OUR MEETING ON FRIDAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MYSELF THE COMMISSIONER CONNIE MISTER JOHNSON -- HERE FOR QUESTIONS. BURGER -- YES WELL AS WELL TURN TO THE VICE CHAIR AND THEN I'LL TURN TO DR QUIRK BUT I JUST WANTED. TO I THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND HELPING TO PREVIEW WHAT -- YOU WERE ABLE TO ARTICULATE IN THE REPORT IS VERY CLEAR AND VERY THOUGHTFUL. EXPLORATION VARIETY OF IDEAS -- AND SOME OF THEM ARE ARE CHALLENGING AND SOME OF THEM NOT AS CHALLENGING. SO WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR FURTHER DELIBERATION AND SEEING WHICH HER ULTIMATE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GOING TO BE AND I SUSPECT THAT. SOME OF THESE IDEAS ARE GOING. TO EXTEND BEYOND THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND WILL REQUIRE A FURTHER DELIBERATION FROM THE LEGISLATURE. ARE GOING FORWARD INTO THE NEXT SESSION AS WELL BUT CLEARLY WE NEED TO ACT AND WE'RE VERY. APPRECIATIVE OF THE THE RANGE OF IDEAS THAT YOU'RE PUTTING OUT THERE -- WE'LL TURN TO OUR VICE CHAIR AND GIVEN UP A RICHER -- FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR THE FOR THAT FOR THE WORK -- THIS IS DEEP AND SERIOUS AND I THINK WELL DONE. AND SO I'M GRATEFUL FOR I'M GRATEFUL FOR IT. I I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BROAD AN OVERALL POLICIES THAT ARE HERE. BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. RATE PAYERS AND VICTIMS. ARE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SHOULDER A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN. CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND. HOW RATE PAYERS ARE? FAIRLY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPONSIBLE. FOR INCREASED COST AND CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND. WITH RESPECT UP TO VICTIMS OUR WHETHER OR NOT THEIR COMPENSATION AS YOU SEE IT. WILL BE ADEQUATE AND SUFFICIENT WHAT? I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND ONE OF THE THINGS I HAD REFLECT ALONG THIS PROCESS IS THAT. THERE IS THE SAME PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR WILD FIRE VICTIMS ARE ALSO RATE PAYERS AND THEIR PROPERTY OWNERS AND SOME OF THEM ARE SHAREHOLDERS. AND WANTING TO ULTIMATELY BE FAIR TO CALIFORNIANS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON AND THE A I WAS SANTA TALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THEY INCLUDE COMPONENTS THAT MAKE SURE THAT UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS AND UTILITIES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BOTH EXPECTATIONS FOR UTILITY MANAGEMENT. AND SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS AROUND. PRUDENT BEHAVIOR. AND MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE ARE COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED IN PRUDENT BEHAVIOR. THAT IS THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY THE SHAREHOLDERS THAT BEAR MUCH OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY. NOW THAT BEING SAID IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RATE PAYERS TO FIND THE SYSTEM THAT IS HEALTHY AND STRONG. AND A BIG PART OF THAT IN THIS NEW NORMAL WITH WILDFIRES. IS FUNDING INVESTMENTS AND WHILE FIRE MITIGATION. AND ALSO AT TIMES ABSORBING SOME OF THE COST WHEN THERE IS A FIRE ON THE SYSTEM. THERE ARE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE RECOMMEND -- TO REDUCE THE COSTS TO RATEPAYERS AND WHILE FIRE VICTIMS. WHEN IT COMES TO REDUCING THE COST? RATEPAYERS. MISTER KHAN CAN SPEAK TO THIS BUT THE RECOMMENDATION TO REFORM INVERSE CONDEMNATION. IT'S PARTLY DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT ABSENT REFORM IN THAT AREA THOSE COSTS FALL TO SHAREHOLDERS IN RATE PAYERS. AND REFORM TO A FAULT BASED STANDARD ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THOSE ARE COST THAT CAN BE BROADLY SOCIALIZED ACROSS ALL CALIFORNIANS ACROSS ALL TAXPAYERS. THE PROPOSAL OF A FIND IS FOCUSED ON GIVEN INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND THE FACT THAT THE COST. OTHERWISE DEFAULT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND RATE PAYERS CAN YOU MORE BROADLY SOCIALIZES COST. AND SO WHEN YOU CREATE A FINE YOU SOCIALIZE THOSE COST AS WELL TO PROPERTY OWNERS WHO LIVE IN THESE AREAS AS WELL AS SOME COSTS ARE BORNE BY THE STATE WE RECOMMEND SPECIFICALLY THAT. A FUND BE SET UP AS A TAX EXEMPT ORGANIZATION. AND SO THE STATE'S CONTRIBUTION TO SOME OF THAT LOST A TAX REVENUE. THE FUND IDEA WE PROPOSED GENERALLY AND I'LL SAY MORE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS I'VE HEARD HAVE REALLY FOCUSED ON REPAIR NEUTRALITY -- SO WE RECOMMEND FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE RATE PAYER CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIND BE SIMILAR. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES CHARGE THAT REPAIRS CURRENTLY PAY FOR POWER KAMALA TRICITY CRISIS WHICH IS DUE. TO A AND NEXT YEAR AND SO IF REPLACE THAT BOND WITH A SIMILAR SIZE BOND. RATE PAYERS SHOULD BE. NEUTRAL TO THE IMPACT OF A FUN. AND THEN YOU SUPPLEMENT THAT WITH OTHER FUNDING. AS IT RELATES THE FAMOUS FOR WILD FIRE VICTIMS MAN I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO IS AS MUCH MEDICATION AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE GET SMALLER AND SMALLER. BUT WHAT A FINE DOES IS ALLOW FOR QUICKER PAYMENTS. TO THOSE WHILE FIRE VICTIMS -- THAT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE HISTORICALLY WHAT WE HEARD FROM WHILE FIRE VICTIMS AND THEIR ATTORNEYS. WAS THAT ONE OF THE BENEFITS BENEFITS OF HAVING INVERSE CONDEMNATION AS IT CURRENTLY IS IS THAT THE UTILITIES MORE QUICKLY COME TO THE TABLE SERVICE SETTLING CLAIMS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR WHILE FIRE VICTIMS TO GET PAID QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY ALTERNATE LIVING EXPENSES THEY GET FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES.% AND WITHIN A TWO YEAR PERIOD. SO SOME OF THE WHAT WE PROPOSE IS ABOUT GETTING WHILE FIRE VICTIMS PAID QUICKLY. BEFORE THEIR SET A PRUDENT SEE DETERMINATION. SO I'LL STOP THERE BUT I THINK EVEN SENSITIVE AT TO BOTH OF THOSE GROUPS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. I'D. IT'S NOT NECESSARY IF YOU WHAT IF YOUIF YOU WOULD LIKE TO AYE THAT'S FINE. IT WOULD HELP CERT CERTAINLY -- WHAT THANK YOU HI? I IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT VICTIMS ARE WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WAS DETERMINE HOW VICTIMS ARE TREATED NOW. AND THE EFFECT ON VICTIMS OF THE CURRENT SITUATION AND WHAT WE LEARNED WAS THAT. UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION VICTIMS ARE TERRIBLY COMPROMISED BECAUSE THE UTILITIES ARE EITHER BANKRUPT OR THREATENING TO GO BANKRUPT. SO THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF VICTIMS ONE KIND OF VICTIM IS THE CASUALTY VICTIM IT'S THE PERSON WHO LOST THEIR LIFE IT'S THE PERSON IS NOT COVERED BY INVERSE CONDEMNATION. THAT PERSON IN THE ABSENCE OF THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY WOULD HAVE FULL RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A JURY WOULD BE VINDICATED. BUT BECAUSE INVERSE CONDEMNATION. HAD THE RESULT OF FORCING P. JEANNIE TO BANKRUPTCY THE CASUALLY VICTIMS HAVE ALL BEEN LUMPED IN WITH EVERYBODY ELSE SO ONE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCE OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION WE LEARNED. AT ALL I'M DOING IS REFLECTING WHAT WE LEARNED THIS IS JUST THIS IS AN OPINION THIS IS THE TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE IS. INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS VERY HARMFUL TO CASUAL THE VICTIMS BECAUSE IT THROWS THE UTILITY IN A BANKRUPTCY AND ELIMINATES OR SEPARATE RIGHTS. AS TO THE PROPERTY DAMAGE VICTIMS THE PEOPLE WHO GET AYE RECOVER ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE OF INVERSE WHAT WE LEARNED IS TWO THINGS. PREJUDICE THEM ONE IS IN THE NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCE A PROPERTY DAMAGE VICTIM IN THE CASE OF NEGLIGENCE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A JURY WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF THE RIGHTS VINDICATED. BUT RATHER THAN THAT HAPPENING THEY ARE THROWN INTO BANKRUPTCY AND AGAIN THEIR RIGHTS ARE PREJUDICED MORE OVER AND THIS IS THE REALLY BAD EFFECTIVELY PGD BANKRUPTCY. IF THERE ARE FIRES. AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY THERE'S A PROCESS IN THE BANKRUPTCY THAT SUBORDINATES THE CLAIMS OF THE PROPERTY DAMAGE VICTIMS SO WHAT WE LEARNED WAS. THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS TERRIBLY PREJUDICIAL TO THE VICTIMS ON BOTH ACCOUNTS OF THE VICTIMS AND THE PROPERTY VICTIMS. OF AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE THOUGHT THAT. CHANGING THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION WOULD BE MORE FAIR. IN TERMS OF THE RATE PAYERS. WHAT WE LEARNED WAS UNDER THE STRESS TEST THE WAY THAT NINE A ONE WORKS THE CURRENT SYSTEM? DEFAULTS TO THE RATE PAYER PAYING. SO I KNOW AND AND YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND NONE OF US ARE POLITICIANS. MARY YOUR CONSULTANT COULD TELL YOU OF MY EXPERIENCE HERE. IS IT BY AYE MY FIRST COMMISSION WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO -- I'VE HAD MANY COMMISSIONS IN MANY DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENTS BUT I'M I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT PART OF IT ALL WE KNOW IS THE FACT THAT WE WERE TOLD. AND THE FACTS WE WERE TOLD OUR THAT UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION ONCE THE UTILITIES ARE BANKRUPT AND GONE OR WORSE. IN THE CASE OF THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC UTILITIES ALL TALK ABOUT THE REPAIRS ARE ON THE HOOK THE CURRENT SITUATION IS REALLY. A DAMAGE TO THE RATE PAYERS AND LET ME EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU IN THE CONTEXT WE HAVE. FIFTY SIX PUBLIC UTILITIES THAT MEET YOU CALL THEM UNITS AND WE HAVE THREE THOUSAND WATER COMPANIES. THOSE FIFTY SIX PUBLIC UTILITIES ARE THE RATE PAYERS THEY HAVE NO SHAREHOLDERS THE EFFECT OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU TILT THEIR UTILITY LET'S TAKES MUD SINCE WE'RE ALL HERE. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SMOG DOES ANYTHING WRONG. THE EFFECT IS THE RATE PAYERS PAY. SO WE HEARD TESTIMONY AND WE HAVE WILL PASS IT ON TO YOU OUT WE HAVE LUMINOUS TESTIMONY THAT THE RATE PAYERS OF THE STATE ALREADY ENORMOUSLY BURDENS THEY'RE KIND OF UP TO IT. WE GOT IT FROM THE ARE THE CONSUMERS WE GOT IT FROM THE COMMERCIAL RATE PAYERS BUT IN ANSWER TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION. ASSEMBLYMAN PATTERSON THE WHAT WE LEARNED WAS THE IF IMPACT OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION WAS. TERRIBLY THREATENING THE RATE PAYERS THEY ARE WE'RE GOING TO PAY. OUT FOR ALL OF THIS IN THE CASE OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES AND THE WATER COMPANIES THERE IS NO SALVATION FOR THEM THEY THEY'VE COME TO US AND SAID THAT THEIR FAITH AND THIS IS IN A REPORT. THEY ARE THREATEN THEIR EXISTENCE IS THREATENED. IN THE CASE OF THE THREE I'LL USE THE STRATEGY OF THE I. O. USE THE P. YOU SEE AND NINE A ONE IS TO SHIFT. THE COST OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION. TO THE RATE PAYERS AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT SO THE QUESTION IS WE FACED IS WHAT COULD WE DO ABOUT IT. AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S TWO THINGS TO DO ABOUT IT EITHER TO FIGURE OUT SOMEWHERE ELSE THE SHIFTED. FOR TO ELIMINATED. ON THE LIABILITY BUT THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS. UNLESS IT'S REMEDY EITHER THAT THE EFFECT OF THE CAUSE IS TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES TO THE VICTIMS. AND THE RATE PAYERS THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE TOO BUT YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. AMERICAN ONE OTHER POINT SIR -- THAT MISTER KHAN THAT REMIND ME OF WE TALKED ABOUT THE BANKRUPTCY. WHICH IS. UNDER THE STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW AS MISTER KHAN NOTED THE COMBINATION OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION AS WELL AS HOW COST RECOVERY IS PURSUED IS VIEWED BY INVESTORS AND RATING AGENCIES AS VERY RISKY. AND SO THEY HAVE DOWNGRADED SEVERAL OF OUR UTILITIES AND THEY HAVE SAID THAT THERE AREN'T THERE ARE NO REFORMS THEY WILL DOWNGRADE THEM SOME MORE. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN BANKRUPTCY TO HAVE THOSE DOWNGRADES ACTUALLY COST REPAIRS. WHAT WE HEARD IN TESTIMONY WAS THAT IF THE COST OF CAPITAL COST OF DATA IS INCREASED 1% AND THEN IT'S COUPLED WITH A 3% INCREASE IN THE COST OF EQUITY? THAT RAISES RATES NEARLY 7% FOR RATE PAYERS AND THAT'S WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING WE ALSO HEARD FROM SMUD THAT EVEN GOING DOWN FROM A DOUBLE A RATING. ONE NOTCH CAN COST THEM A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EXTRA IN SERVICING THAT AND THAT'S WHY ARE BIG TAKE AWAY IS THAT THE STATUS QUO IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. UP WITH THE GOVERNOR. AND YOUR GROUP ISSUED -- A STATEMENT ABOUT THIS AND I WANT TO QUOTE. FROM THE PARAGRAPH. WE WILL PURSUE LEGISLATION TO TACKLE THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. TO PROVIDE CERTAIN THE ACCOUNTABILITY WE WILL SEEK EQUITABLE RESOLUTION ON THE PRUDENT MANAGER. STANDARD BRIDGE FINANCING AND TO ALLOW COST RECOVERY FOR ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS WHO ACT RESPONSIBLY AND THE PUBLIC'S BEST INTEREST CAN YOU GIVE US. A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE KIND OF LEGISLATION THAT. YOU MAY BE SUGGESTING. WELL SIR THAT WAS NOT FROM OUR GROUP -- THAT WAS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS SENT AN ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP BUT I THINK CONSUME WITHIN. WITHIN OUR REPORT YOU CAN FIND SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THAT DIRECTION. SO IN YOUR REPORT YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO LEGISLATION OR BASICALLY IN IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT LEGISLATION MIGHT LOOK LIKE. WE HAVE A COMBINATION IMPLICATIONS AS WELL AS ELEMENTS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE IN LEGISLATION. I THINK ONE OF THE THE KEY POINTS TO RAISE IS THAT IS GOING TO TAKE SEVERAL DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS COMING TOGETHER TO MAKE THE SOLUTIONS WORK AND SO OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE OBJECTIVE OF THE LEGISLATION TO BE WATER SOME THIRD RAILS TO AVOID BUT THEN PROVIDE YOU AND THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROCESS AND YOUR PROCESS. WITH INFORMATION TO COME TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY PUT PEN TO PAPER OKAY WE VIEW THIS AS WE WORK FOR YOU AND SO OUR JOB WAS. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FACTS WERE. AND TO IDENTIFY THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE. BUT WE DIDN'T PRESUME TO SUGGEST. OBVIOUSLY IT'S IT'S THE NIGHT A ONE SWEATSHIRT ONE FINAL AND FINAL I KNOW I C. PUSHING THE BUTTON. YOU'RE VERY KIND. DID YOU APPROACH. WITH RESPECT TO THIS NEW NEW NORMAL EXPLOSIVE FIRES THAT ARE pDID YOU APPROACH ANY TESTIMONY INFORMATION OR DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF DAUGHTER RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT. TO WHAT. UP CALIFORNIA CAL FIRE. NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND WITH RESPECT TO FIRE FIGHTING. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE REAL CAPACITY ISSUES HERE. THAT THERE ARE REAL PRE POSITIONING ISSUES THERE'S REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT ADEQUATE PERSONNEL ADEQUATE TRUCKS ADEQUATE AVIATION. AND THE LIKE IT SO IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE WE ARE SORT OF IN. IN A WORLD WAR TWO MODE AND WE SORT OF NEED A MARSHALL PLAN. FOR FIGHTING FIRES IN CALIFORNIA THIS VERY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE TAKEN IN TIMES PAST HAVE YOU TOUCHED ON THAT IN ANY OF THIS. WE HAVE NOT WE FOLLOW THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION TO FOCUS ON COST AND THERE IS A LOT TO COVER WITHIN THAT TOPIC. I I DISAGREE WITH THAT I'M SORRY -- I THINK WE HAVE IN IN OUR SECTION IN THIS WAY. AND YOUR SECTION NEWARK WHICH OF THE REPORT. IT'S RETURN TO THE LIABILITY SIX OKAY WE OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING. FIRST OF ALL WE GOT JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND WE GOT TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TESTIMONY WHICH CORROBORATES WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND WE WILL PASS IT ON TO YOU. THAT WE ARE RESOURCE. STARVED AND WE NEED TO COORDINATE BUT HERE IS WHERE I DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES. WE FOUND OUT THAT ALL FIFTY SIX PUBLIC UTILITIES HAVE THEIR OWN WAY OF DOING THINGS AND THE I USE THREE PUBLIC UTILITIES PRIVATE UTILITIES HAVE THEIR WAY OF DOING THINGS. AND WE CONCLUDED THAT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IS THEY SHOULD THERE SHOULD BE A WILDFIRE BOARD WHICH COORDINATES ALL OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE TELE THESE WITH RESPECT WILD FIRES. BECAUSE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF REDUNDANCY AND THERE'S A TREMENDOUS THAT PEOPLE DO THE SAME THING IN DIFFERENT ARE JURISDICTIONS AND ALSO THIS CONTRADICTION. WE FOR CITED THE FACT THAT. IN FLORIDA THEY FACE THE SAME EMERGENCY FOR HURRICANES AND WE ALSO FACE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH RESPECT EARTHQUAKES. AND WE IF YOU'LL SEE IN OUR REPORT IN OUR SECTION OF AND THAT'S WHY MY COLLEAGUE PROBABLY DIDN'T JUMP TO THE THE THOUGHT. ON IN OUR SECTION WE RECOMMEND CONSOLIDATING THE APPROACH WE THINK THAT HAVING FIFTY NINE DIFFERENT. APPROACHES TO HARDENING AND SAFETY AND HERE'S THE POINT FIFTY NINE DIFFERENT PEOPLE AGENCIES COORDINATE WITH CAL FIRE AND YES. ISRAEL MAKES NO SENSE THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE SINCE THIS IS SUCH A BIG EMERGENCY TO HAVE ONE CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY THAT COLLECTS DATA THAT. MARSHALS RESOURCES AND COORDINATES WITH THE STATE SO. THAT KIND THAT'S OUR BEST EFFORT AT YOUR MARTIAL PLEDGE. THE SHERIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I WANT EXPRESS SAID. REAL APPRECIATION FOR THE QUALITY OF THE WORK I I'M JUST GONNA SAY THAT YOU FOLKS ARE REALLY GOOD. THAT I APPRECIATE HOW DEEP AND THOROUGH YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS AND THANK YOU FOR HAVE. APPROACHING THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT I'VE RAISED I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE. EVAN AGAIN WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU HAVE NOT MET AS A AS A BODY TO SOAR RECONCILE YOUR POINTS OF VIEW SO WE WE APPRECIATE SO THE RAWNESS OF PRESENTATION IN TERMS OF KNOWING THAT THERE ARE STILL ELEMENTS THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO COME TOGETHER ON SO. WE APPRECIATE THE REFLECTIONS BUT UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT IN WHICH YOU HAVE TO REPORT DR. FIRST OF ALL. AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'VE DONE. I ALSO APPRECIATED THE ANSWERS THAT YOU GAVE TO OUR VICE CHAIR. THAT YOU FULLY REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KEEP THE UTILITIES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY IF THE RATE PAYERS AND THE VICTIMS OF THE FIRE GOING TO BE MADE WHOLE. AND YOU REFLECT THAT ON A CAP ON UTILITY PAYMENTS. NOT VOTE FOR THAT THE MINUTE. BUT I KNOW OF ONE SENATOR IN PARTICULAR -- CALL IT A BAILOUT. THE BAILOUT IS BANKRUPTCY -- AND I'LL GET INTO THAT MORE BUT THAT IS THE BALLOT FOR THE UTILITY IT IS BANKRUPTCY THAT IS THE BAILOUT FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS IN HIS BANKRUPTCY. WE'RE GOING TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WE HAVE TO AVOID THAT. YOU TALK ABOUT A PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD. WE ALSO HAVE HEARD THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET SOMETHING DONE BY JULY TWELFTH. NOT SURE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BY THE END OF THE SESSION. THE ONLY THING WE'VE REALLY WORKED ON SO FAR AND THAT'S FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE IS THE THE FIRE FUND. SO HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE GO ABOUT LOOKING INTO PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD WHERE SHOULD WE START. MARY FOR A REPORT. WELL I'VE READ IT AND I DON'T SEE LEGISLATION NOT SOMETHING I CAN PUT INTO LAW AND I HAVE. NOT HAD TIME TO TO REACH I HAVE GONE THROUGH IT RIGHT. BUT I DON'T I DON'T SEE LEGISLATION THERE. UNDERSTOOD WELL ONE THING THAT I HAVE BEEN HEARTENED BY ITS THAT AS WE'VE ALL BEEN GOING ABOUT DOING OUR WORK. INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN DOING WORK ON THEIR OWN AND SO I I WOULD IMAGINE THAT UTILITIES RATE PAYER ADVOCATES INVESTORS HAVE ALL BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS QUESTION AROUND COST RECOVERY AND PRUDENT. MANAGER STANDARD BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A KEY IF NOT THE KEY ISSUE OF CONCERN. PARTICULARLY FOR INVESTORS AS I THINK ABOUT. HOW WILL THEY BE JUDGE GOING FORWARD ME THE BASIC QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO BE PRUDENT -- AND SO I THINK THAT THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE LAID OUT OUR FEASIBLE WITHIN LEGISLATION ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS OPTION. TWO REFERS TO ADDING AN EMPHASIS TO THE NINE A ONE LANGUAGE AROUND THE FACTORS THAT -- MIGHT MITIGATE. IN PRUDENT BEHAVIOR THINGS THAT ARE EXHAUSTION IS LIKE WEATHER PATTERNS CLIMATE CHANGE ETCETERA. IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO WITH ADOPTING THE FIRST STANDARD THAT IS ALSO A STANDARD THAT IS OUT THERE AND I THINK THAT LANCASTER BE THE FIRST SO THE FIRST HAS A STANDARD IN TERMS OF THE SHIFTED THE BURDEN OF PROOF FOR PRUDENT SEE. IS TO THOSE ARE INTERVENING IN A PROCEEDING SO THAT IS THE STANDARD THAT YOU WOULD APPLY TO THE EXISTING P. YOU SEE AT PROCEEDING PROCESS AS WELL. IN TERMS OF OUR THIRD OPTION. ABOUT A ABSOLUTE CAP ON SHAREHOLDER LIABILITY ASSUMING THAT THEY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION -- TO A FUND AGAIN I THINK THERE ARE POTENTIAL OPTIONS OUT THERE AND THAT UTILITIES INVESTORS WILL COME FORWARD WITH PROPOSALS TO YOU OKAY WELL BUT THE PROBLEM WILL BE GETTING IT DONE WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE WANT TO POLITICIZE THE ISSUE. HI THIS IS A BAIL OUT IF YOU CAP THE UTILITIES. WHEN THE REAL BALLOT THIS BANKRUPTCY SO I MEAN WHAT MAY I HAVE A MOMENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER EVERY **** BEEN REFLECTING ON WHAT'S DIFFERENT? NOW THAN LAST YEAR AND ONE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT IS THE NINE OH ONE SB NOT A ONE ORDERING THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS FOR THE UTILITIES. THE P. YOU SEE HAS WORKED VERY QUICKLY AND HARD TO TO GET THOSE PLANS APPROVED AND IT STARTS THE COURSE OF HAVING. A PLAN THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE TO MEET BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE TALK ABOUT A BAIL OUT IS WILL ONE CENT OF IS THERE FOR THE UTILITY TO DO RIGHT. WHY I BELIEVE THAT THE UTILITIES WILL DO THEIR BEST TO AVOID WILDFIRES BECAUSE THE SITUATION IS NOT TENABLE FOR THEM AS WELL NO ONE WANTS TO BE IN A POSITION TO HAVE TO EXERCISE SOME OF THESE? LAST RESORT OPTIONS AND THEN ALSO THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS IMPROVING PUBLIC PROCESS. I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE TIME IS RIGHT TO RELY ON THOSE MEDICATION PLANS EXCLUSIVELY FOR SAYING TO PRODUCE THE STANDARD BUT I DO THINK THEY HELP PROVIDE THE RIGHT INCENTIVES FOR THE UTILITIES. TO BEHAVE BETTER SO ONE OF MY CONCERNS THERE IS THE P. YOU SEE HAS NOT SAID WHETHER OR NOT THE UTILITIES. WILL BE ABLE TO GET ARM RATE PAYERS TO PAY FOR THAT WORK. WHICH PROBABLY DOWNGRADED -- YEAH THIS IN AND SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC -- IF IT DOESN'T DOUBT GRAY THEM TODAY IT'LL DOWNGRADE THEM TOMORROW NOT KNOWING THAT THOSE CAN BE REIMBURSED -- I REALLY WELL. THEN TO GET ONTO CATHOLIC THINGS I WILL SAY THIS I MEAN THE TOTAL MAGNITUDE OF THOSE COSTS ARE A FEW BILLION FROM WHAT I'VE UNDERSTOOD FROM RATING AGENCIES THEIR CONCERN IS NOT THAT LIABILITY WHICH IS. UNDERSTOOD IT'S THE POTENTIAL ON CAPITALIZE BILL OF THE OF BILLIONS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OKAY WITH POTENTIAL FIRES SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WE HAD TO DO. TO KEEP THE OTHER TWO INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY KEEP P. JEANNIE FROM GOING INTO IT AGAIN WHEN IT COMES OUT. AND TO KEEP THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES FROM GOING INTO BANKRUPTCY -- THAT'S WHAT I I'M GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION A SECOND BUT FIRST LET ME. TALK ABOUT GETTING RID OF INVERSE. NOW FOR THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THAT'S ONLY BEEN A DOCTRINE SINCE THE MID NINETIES THAT WAS AN INTERPRETATION THOUGH. OF HEARD APPELLATE COURT LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE HAD A CHANCE TO ROUTE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT INTERPRETATION P. JEANNIE BROUGHT IT FORWARD THEY REFUSE TO LOOK AT IT. IT. DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY WON'T LOOK AT IT EVENTUALLY AND MAYBE DECIDE BUT FOR THE MOMENT THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK IT WAS A COMPLETELY OUT OF THE REALM OF VALID INTERPRETATION. FOR THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES WATER AND ELECTRIC IT'S VERY CLEAR TO ME HE IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT IT WAS SET UP TO DO THIS. THE IDEA WAS IF CITY OR A COUNTY BUILDS A ROAD OR BRIDGE -- THEN IF DOWNSTREAM THERE'S A FROM THE BRIDGE THERE'S SOMEONE IS LOST PART OF THEIR PROPERTY IT'S ACCEPTED THAT A PUBLIC ENTITY CAN. A CHARGE TAXPAYERS TO PAY FOR THAT THE WHOLE IDEA WAS TO BE FAIR IF SOMEONE IS HIDDEN IN IN VIRTUALLY HURT. BY SOMETHING GOING WRONG WITH INFRASTRUCTURE. NOW WE DO HAVE A LAWYER HERE BUT I DO NOT SEE ANY WAY WE CAN BY LAW. FIX THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY AND IF WE WERE TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE INVESTOR LEóN UTILITIES. AGAIN I WOULD SAY. I DON'T SEE A WAY TO DO THAT EITHER IT WOULD OF COURSE GO INTO COURT BY THOSE WHO FELT THEY WERE. DAMAGED BY THIS ARE MOST LIKELY -- ATTORNEYS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES THEY WOULD FIGHT IT. ARM I JUST DON'T SEE AND PERHAPS IN WHAT I WANT TO HEAR IS PERHAPS FROM THE LAWYER HERE WHY THEY THINK PASSING A LAW. WOULD BE -- WOULD JAM. OF TRUMP THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE I JUST DON'T SEE. SO FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT YOU HAVE VERY GOOD GRASP OF THIS -- AND I DON'T KNOW. WHAT I CAN ADD THAT'S THAT INTELLIGENT BUT I'LL GIVE YOU THE CONTRARY VIEW? FIRST OF ALL AS TO THE APPELLATE AN E. M.. EARLIER LIABILITY AS ALL OF YOU RECALL IN THE NINETIES THE UTILITIES IN THE STATE WERE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MONOPOLIES AND THEY HAD AN ABSOLUTE OPPORTUNITY TO PASS ON RATES TO THE RATE PAYERS. ARM AND THE THE NUMBERS WERE SMALL AND THE THE AN ANALYSIS OF THEIRS THERE IS THERE A I THINK THERE SEVEN APPELLATE COURTS IN THE STATE'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT ONLY TWO APPELLATE COURTS HAVE. DEALT WITH THIS AND THE ONE APPELLATE COURT THE DEALT WITH THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE I. O. U.'S DEALT WITH IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TIME THAT THE IRAQIS WERE MONOPOLY. AND HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO PASS THE RATES ON THEY WOULD DID NOT FACE A SITUATION WHERE THE UTILITY WAS ORDERED TO DO SOMETHING AND HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO PASS THINGS ON I DO BELIEVE. THAT THE BUNCH CASE THE FLOOD CONTROL CASES MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE CANNON NOW IT'S AND THE GOVERNOR CAN ANNOUNCE THAT WE'RE FACING UNPRECEDENTED EMERGENCY AND WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE OURSELVES IN A WAY TO FIGHT OFF. WHAT IS A REAL THREAT TO OUR POPULOUS? IN THE BUNCH CASE AND IN THE LEGISLATIVE THE THE CONSTITUTION. IS INTERPRETED WILL BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT IS CLEAR AND WHERE THE SUPREME COURT HAS NOT INTERPRETED THE CONSTITUTION THE LEGISLATURE IS -- DIFFERENCE SO NUMBER ONE THE SUPREME COURT HAS INTERPRETED IT NUMBER TWO THE LEGISLATURE CANADA FOR THE CONSTITUTION NOT TO APPLY I'M TALKING ABOUT THE I'LL USE ONLY NOMINAL PARTY I'LL USE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT VERTICALLY INTEGRATED. MONOPOLIES ANY LONGER BUT INSTEAD HAVE TO GO TO THE P. YOU SEE AND HAVE TO BEG FOR THE MONEY TO BE PASSED ON SO I BELIEVE. THE UNDER THOSE TWO DOCTRINES THE LEGISLATURE CAN ANNOUNCE THAT A WOULD THAT THE DOCTOR THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION DOES NOT APPLY TO THE I USE THIRD. WE'VE THIS IS NOT THIS IS A REAL SERIOUS PROBLEM AND AND JUST SO YOU ALL UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW I WAS ON THAT PROP THIRTY COMMISSION I WAS THE HEAD OF THE I. SO DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS. I WILL WORK THROUGH THE ENTIRE ENERGY SITUATION I'VE DEALT WITH A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN THE STATE THIS IS THE BIGGEST ONE I'VE EVER SEEN. AND THE AND IT'S A SELF INFLICTED WOUND I BELIEVE THAT THE LAW IN THE STATE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED WE HAVE A REAL EMERGENCY AND IF YOU READ OUR REPORT AND THE STRIKE FORCE REPORT. WE HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED THREAT OF WILDFIRES THE COSTS ARE UNPRECEDENTED I BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ON PRESIDENTE THREAT. AND WE WERE MEETING THE THREAT UNDER THE BUNCH CASE UNDER THE LEGISLATIVE INTERPRETATION DOCTRINE THAT THE SUPREME COURT WOULD DIFFER I DO NOT BELIEVE THE SUPREME COURT WOULD SAY. WE ARE IMPOTENT TO TO MEET EMERGENCY OF THIS NATURE AND WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. RIGHT NOW MULTIPLE TWENTY THIRTY BILLIONS BUT WE COULD BE FACING ARM DEPENDING ON THE SUMMER WAY GREATER SO AS TO THE I'LL USE I ACTUALLY THINK. IT'S A PRETTY GOOD STRONG CASE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR STARTUP ANNOUNCED THERE IS AN EMERGENCY AND THEY WERE FACING EMERGENCY. YOUR DISCUSSION OF THE PO USES REALLY NUANCED AND TO BE. HONEST REALLY SOPHISTICATED AND I AM NOT SURE THAT YOU'RE WRONG YOU MAY BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT AND THEY MAY NEED TO REORGANIZE THEMSELVES TO DEAL WITH THIS. ON I I AM NOT CONFIDENT THAT THEY CAN'T BE. PUT WITHIN THE UMBRELLA OF THE EMERGENCY UNDER THE FLOOD CASES. THE THE THE OBJECTION THAT YOU RAISED. WAS OVERRULED BY THE COURTS IN MARCH SAID IN THE FLOOD SITUATION IN THE BUNCH CASE THEY GET ALL FLOODS. ARE SUBJECT TO ARE NOT SUBJECT THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION SO I BELIEVE UNDER THE FLOOD CASE SO. ARM AGAIN I APOLOGIZE FOR LAWYER IN BUT I WAS INVITED NO NO WE WE WANTED THAT AT I BELIEVE THAT. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR COULD TAKE OUR REPORT AND THAT'S RIGHT. FOR AND FACE UP TO THE FACT WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY. DECLARED AN EMERGENCY AND THEN LEGISLATE IN THE FIELD I BELIEVE THEY COULD CREATE YOUR MARTIAL PLAN THAT YOU SUGGESTED IN THE SENSE OF MARSHALLING THE RESOURCES AND CREATING A AGENCY TO DEAL WITH THIS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY DID THAT THEY COULD ALTER THE LANDSCAPE OF LIABILITY NOTE WE DON'T ADVOCATE THAT THE LIVE THE ITALIANS ARE OFF THE HOOK. RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT A DEALING WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND WHAT IT IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO TRADITIONALLY WE DO NOT OVER REAL COURT CASES. PERIOD. I IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING WE DO. RIGHT BUT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT HERE WERE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE HAVE SIX DISTRICTS ONLY TO HAVE. OPINED ON THIS THE OTHER FOUR OF NOT RULE THE SUPREME COURT HAS NOT RULED AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T OVERRULED COURT CASES BUT JUST. IN MY CHECKERED PAST THAT REPRESENT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND ONCE UPON A TIME DIGITAL COUNCIL WENT FOR THE RIGHT TO ORDER COURT REPORTERS IN THE COURTROOM. AND THE SUPREME COURT RULED WHILE THE LEGISLATURE DECIDED NOT TO ACT AND THE LEGISLATOR WANTED TO ACT THEY COULD HAVE LEGISLATURE TAKES NOTE. THE SUPREME COURT TAKES NOTE OF THE DECISION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT OR NOT TO ACT. ON ANYWAY IT'S MIGHT BELIEVE. OPTIMISTIC THAT IF YOU WISH TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU CAN. OKAY -- THE OUR FINAL QUESTION IS. WHAT YOU E. F. COMMISSIONER -- PETERMAN YOU SAID YOU'VE TALKED TO THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES WHAT DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO DO. EITHER BETWEEN NOW AND JULY TWELFTH AT THE END OF THIS SESSION OR NEXT YEAR BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO DO TO KEEP THE OTHER UTILITIES FROM GOING INTO BANKRUPTCY AND GETTING THE SAME PROBLEMS WE NOW HAVE. WITH VICTIMS -- BEING PUT IN AN AREA WHERE THEY CAN'T GET COMPENSATION WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO. WELL I WOULD DISTINGUISH RATING DOWNGRADES FROM AND BEING BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE FROM BANKRUPTCY -- WELL WAIT A SECOND. THEY ARE THAT THEY ARE VERY CLOSELY RELATED I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT WHAT HAPPENED A PGA ANY IS ONCE THEY WENT INTO. THE DOWNGRADE OF JUNK BOND THEY COULD NO LONGER GET CASH. THEY DIDN'T GO INTO BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE UP THERE WAS SOME HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY HAD TO PAY. THEY WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET CASH A PARTLY THAT WAS BECAUSE THE CPUC DID ALLOW THEM TO TAKE OUT A LINE OF CREDIT -- PARTLY BECAUSE THEY INDICATED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE ANY. EIGHTY EIGHT RULINGS SO THE P. YOU SEE DID HAVE A ROLE BUT ONCE YOUR JUNK BOND STATUS YOU RUN OUT OF CASH. AND ONCE YOU RUN OUT OF CASH YOUR ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS BANKRUPTCY. SO A OWNGRADE I BELIEVE THAT EDISON IS JUST ONE OR TWO CLICKS UP FROM. BOB JUNK BOND STATUS AND ELLIS AND THEN SOUTHERN SAN DIEGO IS GAS ELECTRIC IS I THINK THEY CAN WELL DOCTOR QUIRK AYE YEAH FIND. TO THE QUESTION MAKE THAT THE OTHER DISTINCTION WAS GOING TO MAKE THAT. HAVING A BIG CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE WHERE THE LIABILITIES POTENTIALLY OUTSTRIP THE ASSETS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN GETTING TO BANKRUPTCY -- BUT EVEN IF WE HAVE NO FIRES THIS YEAR -- I WANT TO ADDRESS YOUR FIRST POINT WHICH IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF RATING DOWNGRADES EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE A FIRE. AND THAT THE RATING AGENCIES HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND THEY CONTINUE. TO ISSUE PUBLIC DIRECTIVES REGARDING THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL DOWNGRADE. UTILITIES IF WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS THE RISKY ENVIRONMENT FOR UTILITIES IN THE STATE DOES NOT IMPROVE -- SO I WOULD REFER YOU ALL TO THE REPORTS FROM S. AND P. AND MOODY'S. WHERE THEY HIGHLIGHT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE? THAT WOULD MAKE THEM FEEL THAT THE UTILITIES ARE NO LONGER BEARING AS MUCH RISK SPECIFICALLY THEY IDENTIFY CHANGES AND REFORMS THE COST RECOVERY STANDARD. CHANGES IN VERSE A CONDEMNATION ALTHOUGH I THINK THEY SEE THAT AS A LOW PROBABILITY -- AS WELL AS THE BUFFER IN SUPPORT THAT A FUND COULD PROVIDE BUT I I WILL SAY THE MAIN ONE THAT THEY IDENTIFY IS REALLY TO COST RECOVERY. BUT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THOSE DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE TO YOU THAT BE GREAT THANK YOU. I HAVE -- CHAD MAYES AND THEN -- SERIOUS AND I AND OKAY. I I THINK IT -- AND UNFAIRNESS ALSO TO YOU MISS MAYES I THINK. IT'S CLEAR OF HIS BURKE DOES HAVE A BILL THAT'S MADE IT OFF THE FLOOR BUT I THINK WE ALSO HAD A BILL THAT THIS COMMITTEE SAW. THAT DEALT WITH THE FUND -- WE ARE COULD NOT -- PINE -- NOW A DO AN ANALYSIS OF THE BILL FOR A LOT OF REASONS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP IN YOUR REPORT THERE ARE A LOT OF PIECES THAT ARE SHIFTING HERE -- AND KNOWING THAT THIS PROCESS WAS CONTINUING SO. WILL -- BUT THAT BE A TRANSITION FOR FOR YOUR PROTECTION CHAU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IS YOU KNOW -- THIS -- THIS IS BEEN A TEAM EFFORT -- MANY OF US THAT THAT SERVE ON THIS -- ON THIS COMMITTEE SPENT A LOT OF TIME A LAST YEAR. NO WORKING ON THIS -- PARTICULAR ISSUE THERE ARE FOUR OF US THAT ARE SITTING HERE NOW OUT OF FIVE ON THAT SERVED AS CONFEREES ON A NINE OH ONE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME -- LAST YEAR WORKING ON THIS I DO WANT TO SAY AND TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES AND AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR DILIGENT WORK -- FOR YOUR SERVICE -- TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA -- ON THIS WORK IN THE NIGHT A ONE THE COMMISSION -- I KNOW THAT -- COMMISSIONER PETER MEN -- CARLA AND I SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME TOGETHER -- I CAN THINK OF NOBODY BETTER -- TO HAVE BEEN THE CHAIR I FOUND YOU TO BE A BRILLIANT -- AND DISCIPLINED IN IN YOUR IN YOUR WORK -- AND THEN JUST LISTENING TO YOU GUYS TODAY KNOWING THAT YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE ON THE COMMISSION -- THAT REALLY DOES AGAIN -- TO BE ABLE -- TO TO TO TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN SOLVE -- WHAT I THINK IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT -- TO CALIFORNIA AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU. VERY MUCH FOR A FOR YOUR SERVICE -- SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD OF ALREADY BEEN -- BEEN ANSWERED. AB SO I JUST WANTED TO MAYBE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF THE CONCEPTS THAT WERE A WE'RE IN THE REPORT -- MANY OF US THAT THEY BEGIN WORKING ON THIS -- JANUARY OF LAST YEAR REALIZEVERY QUICKLY THAT THE BIG QUESTION BEFORE US -- WAS OKAY WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM -- SO WHO PAYS AND HOW MUCH. RIGHT THOSE ARE SORT OF THE THE TWO BASIC QUESTION WHO PAYS AND AND AND HOW MUCH. MAN IN THIS REPORT AND SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS -- TO THE FUND AND THERE CAN BE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT FUNDS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED ILLIQUIDITY FIND IN A CATASTROPHIC FUND THOSE COULD BE ONE FUND -- THEY COULD BE SEPARATE FUNDS THERE COULD BE MULTIPLE FUNDS -- BUT BROKEN UP BY GEOGRAPHY I THINK I'VE NOW SEEN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY DIFFERENT -- TYPES OF PLANS FOR A DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF OF FUNDS BUT IT STILL GOES BACK TO THAT QUESTION OF OF WHO PAYS AND AND AND HOW MUCH. AND THE THE ONE THING THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR REPORT AND IS THAT TOO BUT TO BROADEN NEEDS THAT WERE BROUGHT IN -- THAT THAT THE COST IS IT'S NOT JUST RATE PAYERS AND SHAREHOLDERS AND TAXPAYERS BUT YOU ALSO ADD ON THE THE PROPERTY INSURANCE PREMIUM PAYERS OR SOME SORT OF SURCHARGE -- THAT'S A THAT'S THERE AND AND I'LL. I REMIND MYSELF OF MY DAYS ON THE CITY COUNCIL ALWAYS TO TALK ABOUT A NEXUS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TAX AND IF HE WAS WHETHER THERE WAS A NEXUS AND I LIKE TO SEE THINGS WHERE THERE IS A VERY CLOSE. NEXUS BETWEEN THE COSTS AND WHAT YOU'RE GETTING A FOR A FOR THE FOR THOSE COSTS AND SO. WHEN YOU THINK OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM I'M? YOU KNOW WHO WHO SHOULD PAY BASED UPON -- THAT NEXUS THAT THE DIRECT CONNECTION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AS YOU NOTED. ONE OF OUR KEY OBJECTIVES WAS RISK PULLING AND SOCIALIZING ACOSTA MORE BROADLY. AND IN THE FRONT CHAPTER WE DETAIL WHY WE THINK. ALL OF THOSE PLAYERS SHAREHOLDERS UTILITY MANAGEMENT. PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY -- IN TERMS OF HELPING TO REDUCE WILD FIRE RISK -- SO OUR INTENTION WITH INCLUDING PROPERTY OWNERS IN A SURCHARGE A SURCHARGE ON INSURANCE WAS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THAT WAS ALSO A BROAD BASE OF INDIVIDUALS. OVER WHICH TO SPREAD SOME OF THESE COSTS AND THEY DO HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY AND HELPING TO REDUCE THE OVERALL SIZE OF WILD FIRE DAMAGE. BECAUSE WE'RE FOCUS NOT JUST ON THE IGNITION WE KNOW THAT THERE'S WHILE FIRING MISSION BUT THE TOTAL ACTUAL COST TO THAT IT'S REALLY A FUNCTION OF WHAT PROPERTY IS IN HARM'S WAY. AS WELL AS WE KNOW WHAT INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS HAVE DONE A LOT TO FORTIFY THEIR HOME AND WHAT LEVELS OF INSURANCE THEY HAVE SO THAT WAS THAT THE NEXUS THAT. WE IDENTIFIED. WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS WOULD BE. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF FEE THAN OTHER FEES THAT HAVE BEEN. ASSOCIATED WITH INSURANCE. BEFORE AND SO THAT'S EXACTLY THE TYPE OF FEEDBACK WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING -- FOR THOSE WITHIN THE INSURANCE MARKET AS THOSE AS WELL AS I'M FROM HOMEOWNERS STOW I JUST WOULD LIKE. TO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THIS. AND WE WILL ON FRIDAY AND WE'VE BEEN PREVENTED TO TALK TO EACH OTHER I I COULD BE THIS CLOSE TO CARLA BUT I CAN'T TALK TO HER ABOUT THIS -- A BECAUSE THE BAG LOOKING RULES SO I THINK WORLD WE MAY HAVE SOME MORE ILLUMINATION FOR YOU ON THAT ON FRIDAY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WHO SHOULDN'T PAY ON HAND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS WE THOUGHT EVERY SOLUTION THAT TALKED ABOUT FUNDS OR ANYTHING ELSE WAS A DISGUISED WAY OF MAKING THE RATE PAYERS PAY. AND THE ONE THING THAT DROVE THE LIABILITY SECTION AND I ASSEMBLYMAN FORMER SELL ME A NOVICE VIEW WAS THAT THE RATE PAYER SHOULD NOT BE UNFAIRLY BURDEN THAT WE SHOULDN'T. PRETEND ARM THAT OUT SOMEBODY ELSE IS PAYING BUT ACTUALLY THE RATE PAYERS ARE GONNA IT'S GONNA CREASE ACROSS THE RATE PAYERS SO THAT'S DO YOU AGREE THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME INDIVIDUALS. THAT OUR SHAREHOLDERS TAXPAYERS RATEPAYERS. AND BUFF PROPERTY INSURANCE PREMIUM PAYERS THAT THERE'S GONNA BE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE GONNA BE THEY'RE GONNA BE PAYING ON ALL ON ALL FOUR CERTAINLY CERTAINLY COR IS AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION I THINK YOU YOU WE WERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RATE PAYERS I KNOW. WAS POLITICIANS -- BECAUSE I AM ONE BY THE WAY -- BUT WE'LL WE'LL SAY I'M NOT A POLITICIAN I'M A STATEMENT I LIKE TO THINK THAT I'M A STATESMAN BUT I'M ALSO. I'M ALSO A POLITICIAN -- AND AND AND BY THAT WE REPRESENT FOLKS -- AND SO WE LIKE TO USE DIFFERENT TERMS TO TRY TO SHIELD -- YOU KNOW WHAT ONE WHERE THE OTHER BUT ULTIMATELY SOMEBODY -- IS GOING TO PAY FOR A FOR THIS LIABILITY IF WE DON'T SOLVE IT. OF THE FOLKS LIKE THE DOCTOR QUIRK WAS SAYING ARE GOING TO PAY PHONE THROUGH BANKRUPTCY OR WE DON'T SOLVE THIS AND WE DOWNGRADE -- THE THE THE THE THE THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES BEGIN TO DOWNGRADE THE DEBT THE COST OF BORROWING IS GOING TO GO UP IN. IF I HEARD -- CARLA CORRECTLY MISTER MISS PETERMAN A CORRECTLY THAT COULD ACTUALLY INCREASE COST 7% -- AND SO IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS THAT THE THAT THAT I THINK WE DON'T KNOW YOU YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT. BUT I JUST WANT I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD DOC THE FOLLOWING UNDERSTANDING. INVERSE CONDEMNATION CREATES ADDITIONAL COST WHETHER THAT STATE WHICH IS TO HAVE IT OR NOT THAT'S UP TO YOU FOLKS NOT US BUT IT CREATES ADDITIONAL COST. CURRENTLY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF THAT COST IS PAID FOR BY INSURANCE IT'S ALREADY PAID. FOR AND THE PURPOSE THE EFFECTIVE INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS TO TAKE THE INSURANCE THAT YOU BOUGHT. AND PAID FOR FOR THE INSURANCE CARRIER AND LET THE INSURANCE CARRIER GOAL TO RECOVER THAT THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL COST WE ASKED EVERYWHERE WE COULD WHETHER THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE THAT IF THEY DO RECOVER THIS COST THAT THE RATE THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER WILL PAY LESS INSURANCE. WE WERE TOLD THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT SO WHAT THE EFFECTIVE INVERSE CONDEMNATION IN THE WHO PAYS IS WE'RE TAKING MONEY. THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAS ALREADY. ACCOUNTED FOR IN THEIR RATES AND WE'RE GIVING IT TO ARM THE INSURANCE COMPANY IT'S A REIMBURSEMENT WERE CREATING A COST AND THE WERE PAIN AND WE'RE TAKING IT. WOULD GIVE ANYTHING INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT IS A POLICY DECISION WE COULD MAKE BUT THAT'S THE REALITY OF WHO'S PAYING. CARLOS POINT ABOUT INSURANCE IS. THE OBSERVATION THAT ALREADY A LOT OF THESE COSTS ARE PAID FOR BY INSURANCE THAT IS OUR CURRENT TO MECHANISM FOR PAYING FOR THIS. AND MAYBE WE SHOULD. PIGGY BACK ON THAT I THINK THAT WAS HER OBSERVATION AND HEARINGS AND I THINK IT WAS VERY CLEVER -- BUT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHERE THAT COMES FROM THE LEFT THE IDEA WHO REYES DREAD THOUGH BECAUSE THE ONE THING THAT COMES UP WITH THAT IS THE UNDER INSURED AND UNINSURED SO THOSE WHO ARE NOT PAYING -- PREMIUMS IN ESSENCE -- ARE ARE THOSE THAT ARE PAYING PREMIUMS ARE PAYING FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T BY PAYING FOR PREMIUMS RIGHT IT IS ON THIS WE CALL THAT MORAL HAS WHAT IT IS MORAL HAZARD AGAIN MORAL HELD A PROBLEM. OF IF YOU TELL THE INSURANCE IF YOU TELL PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE -- WE'VE CREATED THIS THING CALLED INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND IF YOU DON'T BUY INSURANCE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. THERE'S A WORRY THAT PEOPLE WON'T BUY INSURANCE MORE TO THE POINT THERE'S THE WHOLE RIFIC PROBLEM OF PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA AND RAMPANT UNDER INSURANCE RIGHT SO. THEN REMEMBER THE WE'RE PAYING. FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND WE'RE PAYING FOR THE UNDER INSURANCE RIGHT IN THIS COST I I AGREE WITH I AGREE WITH THAT YES. I WANT TO ADD ONE OTHER POINT BY WAY OF BACKGROUND -- WE HEARD IN OUR IN THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD A PROPOSAL FROM EVERY PAIR ADVOCATES GROUP AROUND. HAVING A WILDFIRE FIND THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY CAPITALIZE BY SURCHARGES ON INSURANCE -- THE PERSPECTIVE THERE WAS THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT FOR REALLY FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY AND PRICKLY FAR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THAT WHEN YOU PUT ALL THESE COSTS ON ELECTRIC REPAIRS AS MISTER KHAN IS HIGHLIGHTED. THAT POOR PEOPLE DON'T USE A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF LESS POWER THAN RICH PEOPLE AND SO INHERENTLY. ELECTRICITY PRICES CAN HAVE A REGRESSIVE AFFECT -- THAT'S NOT THE SAME WITH PROPERTY OWNERSHIP AND I KNOW THAT ALL PEOPLE HOME PROPERTY OR RICH BY ANY MEANS -- BUT THAT IS MORE CORRELATED WITH WEALTH AND SO THE PROPOSAL FROM THAT REPAIR ADVOCATES GROUP WAS THAT IF WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO EQUITABLY SOCIALIZE AND PART OF WHAT WE MEAN BY EQUITABLE. IS MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO CAN'T BEAR THE BURDEN DON'T HAVE TO THAN SOCIALIZE ACROSS THE BROADER TAX BASE OR CROSS POP PROPERTY OWNERS -- WOULD BE A MORE FAIR OUTCOME -- SO THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE OF INPUT THAT WE RECEIVED -- THAT LET MY WORKING GROUP TO RECOMMEND SOME COMPONENT COMING FROM PROPERTY OWNERS I WILL SAY WE ARE VERY HIGH LEVEL ABOUT HOW THE SPLIT NEEDS TO BE -- IS THE PRINCIPAL MORE THAT WE WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH MR JUST HAVE TOO MUCH TO MORE QUESTIONS -- ONE IS -- DID YOU LOOK AT ALL ABOUT IT IN ESTABLISHING A FIND. A DID YOU LOOK AT WHETHER THEY CAN BE BROKEN UP G. GEOGRAPHICALLY MAYBE IN NORTH STATE FUND AND A SOUTH STATE FUND OR IS THERE ANY THOUGHT OF JUSTIN NEEDED BE -- ONE ONE FUND ACROSS ALL CALIFORNIA. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES FUNDS WORK WELL IS PULLING RISK AND SO THE BROADER EACH YOU CAN GEOGRAPHICALLY. SOURCE SAID AS WELL AS COMBINING DIFFERENT TYPES OF RISK OUR UTILITY TERRITORIES HAVE INHERENTLY DIFFERENT RISK COULD DO TO THE GEOGRAPHY SO MY CONCERN PRACTICALLY WITH BREAKING UP INTO MULTIPLE FUNDS IS THAT A VERY QUICKLY JUST BECOMES IN A SELF INSURANCE MECHANISM. WITHIN EACH UTILITY TERRITORY I AND SO THAT'S WHY WE RECOMMEND THAT INCLUDING PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES NOW ALLOWING THAT TO BE VOLUNTARY. BUT OUR DISSIPATION WOULD BE THAT INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BUT ALL PARTICIPATE GIVEN. THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME COST RECOVERY FORMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PARTICIPATION AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION IS -- IN REGARDS TO THE TIMING OF A FUND THE RECOMMENDATION WAS TEN YEARS -- WHY TEN YEARS WHEN NOT FIFTEEN YEARS WHY NOT TWENTY YEARS IF THIS IS A NEW NORMAL -- AND THESE NEW CLIMATE I'M IMPACTS -- HAVE CREATED THIS NEW NORMAL -- IS IT BECAUSE OF INVESTMENT -- IS IT BECAUSE THE STATE HAS INVESTED IN -- BUT LAST YEAR WE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HOW TO D. G. R. F. WE JUST WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT LAST LAST WEEK IS THAT NUMBER NEED TO GO HIGHER. I'M IS IT BECAUSE OF THAT IS IT BECAUSE OF THE WORK THE HARDENING THAT WE EXPECT OUR UTILITIES TO DO WHY TEN YEARS AND NOT A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND WE I'LL MAKE SOME CLARIFICATIONS ON FRIDAY REGARDING OUR RECOMMENDATION THIS REGARD WHICH IS. WE DON'T RECOMMEND AN AUTOMATIC SUNSET TO A FUND -- I THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP A FINE AS LONG AS NECESSARY BUT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT WITH THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS GOING INTO A FACT TO SOME OF THOSE PREVENTION EFFORTS GOING TO A FACT. THAT WE SHOULD SEE LOWER RISK IN TEN YEARS AND SO. WHEN WE'VE ASKED THE UTILITIES THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO ACTUALLY SEE THESE MITIGATION PLAN RESULTS COME INTO EFFECT? TEN YEARS WHAT PEOPLE HAVE RAISED SO WE RECOMMEND. EVALUATING THE FIND THE NEED THE CAPITALIZATION EVERY FIVE TO TEN YEARS -- AND THEN OVER TIME YOU MIGHT NEED A VERY SMALL FUND WHICH MIGHT JUST MAKES SENSE TO ROLL IT DOWN BUT I WOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY SENSE THAT IT I THINK THAT MAKES SOME SENSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU -- THIS RARE SOON AND DOCTOR WOULD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I DO WANNA JOIN MY OF MY FELLOW MEMBERS AND THANKING YOU. FOR YOUR HARD WORK THIS WAS A LOT OF WORK AND WE WE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND SB NINE A ONE ON THAT. COMMISSION AND WE I RECOGNIZE THE HARD WORK THAT WENT INTO. TO PREPARING THIS AND HAVING THOSE HEARINGS LISTENING TO THOSE WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED. TO THEM PREPARED THIS REPORT. IN LOOKING AT THE THE PURPOSE. OF THE COMMISSION -- IT. WHERE IT AND I QUOTE IT IT WAS TO MAKE? RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGES TO LAW THAT WOULD INSURE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF COSTS. AMONG AFFECTED PARTIES END QUOTE. MY CONCERN IS THAT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE. AND I KNOW IT'S NOT A VERY POPULAR TERM BUT WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO BAIL OUT. OF THE UTILITIES. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WERE TALKING ABOUT AFFECTED PARTIES WELL THE AFFECTED PARTIES ARE GOING TO BE THE RATE PAYERS AND TO THE THE THE FIRE VICTIMS. THERE THAT THEY ARE THE AFFECTED PARTIES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT DISTRIBUTION COSTS AMONG AFFECTED PARTIES. RATHER THAN. AMONG AFFECTED PARTISAN RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. AND THEN WE JUMP RIGHT INTO GETTING RID OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION. SOMETHING THAT. L. IS DR CORPUS TALKED ABOUT A WEEK IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT SOMETHING THAT IS CONSTITUTIONAL IS ALREADY BEEN REVIEWED. AND THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE VERY LONG SO SHOW EVEN IF WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IN A VERY SHORT WHILE THIS GOING TO HELP US IN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. INVERSE CONDEMNATION HAS A LOT TO DO WITH EMINENT DOMAIN SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE PROPERTY THEN REVERTS BACK TO THE HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE THAT WAS A TRADE OFF THERE WAS A BALANCING. SO WE CAN'T JUST GET RID OF EMINENT DOMAIN THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE TO THAT. I IT WASN'T JUST -- SAYING WELL LET'S. REALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR UTILITIES HERE AND LET'S HAVE LET'S PUT IN STRICT LIABILITY. NO WE WAS THEY GOT TO TAKE YOU THE PROPERTY WILL PAUSE I GUARD GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS TAKING THE PROPERTY THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN -- THERE WAS JUST SO MUCH TO IT [inaudible] THE IT LATER ALSO IN THE REPORT WE TALK ABOUT SHIFTINGTHE BURDEN I MEAN I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I SAW THIS ONE QUITE FRANKLY WERE. NOW THE IT IS PRESUMED OR ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COST RECOVERY. THEY WOULD BE PRESUMED. THAT THE UTILITY ADDED AT ACTED PRUDENTLY AND IF BUT THOSE WHO WERE AFFECTED CAN THEN FILED THEIR LAWSUIT AND TRY TO PROVE OTHERWISE. THAT ISN'T THE LINE I I WOULD ABSOLUTELY. OBJECT TO CHANGING THE THE BURDEN. SHIFTING THE BURDEN THAT WAY TO THE VERY VICTIMS WERE TRYING TO HELP SO WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO HELP UTILITY AND LIKE I GET IT WE DON'T WANT PGA. TWO TWO TO BE COMPLETELY BANKRUPT I KNOW WE WE DON'T WANT THAT. WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO VICTIMIZE A VERY VICTIMS WERE SAYING WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE SOCIALIZE ALL OF THIS AND FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT IT DOESN'T FALL ON JUST? ONE PERSON ONE GROUP. WE'RE FORGETTING THE UTILITIES WERE FORGETTING THE THE SHAREHOLDERS AND I AND I EVEN NOW AS I SAY THAT I DO RECOGNIZE THE YOU TALKED ABOUT. IN YOUR THE THIRD OPTION FOR COST RECOVERY IT'S LIKE THE STRESS TEST THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT IN OUR NINE A ONE DISCUSSIONS. I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT A LOT OF WHAT I HAVE. READ IT HERE HOW HAS MORE TO DO WITH. WITH FIGURING OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP. SPECIFICALLY PGA ANY THROUGH ALL OF THIS. WITHOUT CALLING IT A BAILOUT BUT FINDING WAYS TO GET EVERYBODY. TO CHEN SO THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS. THAT THAT ISN'T WHAT WE THAT ISN'T WHAT I WANT TO DO. I THINK THAT IF IF WE DIDN'T AND I RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T WANT THE SUNSET NECESSARILY. BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE THE WE'RE GOING TO REEVALUATE. BUT I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED BY THAT. I I DO WANT US TO FIND SOLUTIONS I DO WANT US. TO YOU KNOW REVIEWS SO THEY'RE TOO BIG TO TO TO FAIL I GET THAT -- AND IN THE END THE RATE PAYERS MAY PAY MORE IF THEY FAIL I GET THAT. BUT IF WE ARE BEGINNING OR AT LEAST AS AS I READ THIS. WE ARE BEGINNING THIS WHOLE PROCESS. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? FIGURING OUT A WAY. TO TO CHANGE THE LAW. TO ENSURE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF COSTS AMONG AFFECTED PARTIES. I AM TERRIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- I I APPRECIATE ALL. STILL APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT WENT INTO IT. I DO I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT WENT INTO IT. BUT BUT I AM I AM CONCERNED ABOUT BEGINNING THERE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT FINDING WAYS. TO TO HELP THIS. CORPORATION NOT FILL THIS THIS UTILITY NOT TO FAIL. I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THAT. IS WHAT I HEAR MOST HERE -- I APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORTS BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS FUND AND YOU HAVE CERTAINLY LOOKED AT WAYS. ARE ON ON ON PAYING OUT TO THESE CLAIMS -- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THERE ISN'T A AN INCENTIVE. ON THE PART OF HOMEOWNERS TO OVERSTATE THEIR CLAIMS. BUT I APPRECIATE ALSO THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT THERE ISN'T AN INCENTIVE ON THE USE. OF THE PART OF THE UTILITIES ALSO TO RELY ON THAT RATHER THAN DOING THEIR WORK. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THAT WASN'T DONE AND I RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED. TO TURN OVER THE LEAF AND YOU KNOW WE WE WE WE NEED TO TURN THE PAGE AND GO ON TO THE NEXT THING BUT I'M STILL THERE I'M STILL IN THE FACT THAT. THAT WE HAD SO MUCH THAT WAS. NOT DONE BY OUR UTILITIES TO THE DEGREE THAT WE NOW HAVE THE DEATHS AND WE HAVE THE THE LOSS OF PROPERTY THAT WE HAVE. I I I WANT TO BE SURE -- THAT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS. THAT WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR WAYS JUST TO HELP A UTILITY THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO HELP THOSE VICTIMS. AND THE RATE PAYERS. BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TWO THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITY. TO AND SO I ASKED MY ONE QUESTION. THE WHAT IS THE INCENTIVE FOR THE UTILITIES. TO BEHAVE BETTER. WELL LET ME SAY FOR SO I APPRECIATE GREATLY YOUR COMMENTS AS WELL AS YOUR FRUSTRATION -- I SURE THAT FRUSTRATION. WHEN I GOT? APPOINTED TO THE WELFARE COMMISSION MY LOOK AT THE EXPERTISE THAT ALL FIVE MEMBERS ARE BRINGING. I WAS COMING FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND WITH THAT I KNEW I HAD AND I STILL BELIEVE A REAL RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT THIS FROM A REPAIR IMPACT PERSPECTIVE. AND WITH EACH OF THESE ISSUES AS I LOOKED AT IT AND I THOUGHT THROUGH. SOLUTIONS MANY OF THEM COME BACK EVENTUALLY TO THE RATE PAYERS IT'S JUST WHETHER WHERE HONEST ABOUT THAT AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND SO. I THINK WE ARE AT THIS TIME WHEN THIS THE LEVEL OF CATASTROPHE. AS THE SONG I MEAN THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE GET TO ANTICIPATED TO GET TO THIS MAGNITUDE -- AND YOU KNOW COLLECTIVELY. WE HAVE NOT REQUIRE THAT LEVEL INVESTMENT AND NOW WE'RE REQUIRING THAT THE LEGISLATION TO HAVE THE WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS OF THE EFFORTS AROUND CAL FIRE AND CLEARING OUR FOREST ALL THAT IS GOOD WORK BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO. AND I'M TO BE HONEST THAT' ALL GOING TO COST A LOT OF MONEY. AND IT IS REALLY HARD TO GET THAT MONEY. I PARTICULARLY FROM INVESTORSAT A REASONABLE PRICE IF WE DON'T ADDRESS. THE NEAR TERM A VIEW THAT THE UTILITIES ARE TOO RISKY TO INVEST IN. SO THE WAY I PERCEIVE SEVERAL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IT'S ABOUT RESTORING RIGHT NOW INVESTOR CONFIDENCE. AND YOUR CONFIDENCE IN UTILITIES LONG ENOUGH TO LET THESE PREVENTIONS WORK -- WE HAD TESTIMONY THAT THE UTILITIES ARE SCHEDULED TO SPEND. THREE I'LL USE SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTING IN OUR SYSTEM OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WE HAVE TO RAISE THAT MONEY FROM BOND HOLDERS INVESTORS THAT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT RATE PAYERS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE I IN REAL TIME. AND SO GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GIVE OURSELVES SOME BREATHING ROOM COLLECTIVELY TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM WHILE HOLDING UTILITIES FEET TO THE FIRE SO TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION. WHAT IS THE INCENTIVE? FOR THE UTILITIES. TO BEHAVE BETTER -- I THINK THERE ARE A FEW. ONE IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PURSUING. FINES AND PENALTIES -- ALL OF THAT WORK HAPPENS IN PARALLEL TO A PRUDENT SEE DETERMINATION -- IT YOU THAT SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS MAKING SURE WE HAVE THAT THE SECOND IS HAVING ACTUAL WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS HAVING UTILITY SAY UP FRONT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. AN IMPROVING THOSE PLANS EVERY YEAR -- THE OTHER IS REQUIRING US SOME INVESTMENT BY SHAREHOLDERS AND THE NUMBERS THAT ARE BEING THROWN AROUND ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT -- AND I WOULD SAY FAIRLY UNIQUE IN TERMS OF WHAT SHAREHOLDERS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO AROUND THE COUNTRY I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE HAS SPOKEN VERY CLEARLY. THAT THEY EXPECT. THE STATE NOT TO BEAR ALL THESE COST -- AND AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT -- IS SO I I THINK WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE. BECAUSE AT SOME POINT CAPITAL CAN MOVE ELSEWHERE AND WE REALLY DO NEED THAT CAPITAL TO HELP US INVEST IN ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE WANT TO SEE THE CLEAN ENERGY ENERGY EFFICIENCY. ETCETERA -- BUT I'LL TAKE YOUR COMMENTS TO HEART AND WILL CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN RECOMMEND -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UTILITIES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE -- BUT ULTIMATELY P. GENIE IS THE BIGGEST UTILITY IN THE STATE AND SO. WE NEED. THEM TO WORK SUCCESSFULLY. AND STILL LOOK. AT IT AGAIN DID YOU MENTION P. GINNY EXCUSE ME JUST ONE SECOND. IF WE'RE ASKING ALL OF OUR UTILITIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS FUND. THERE WASN'T THE GREATEST SHARE THEIR BANKRUPTCY SO WE CAN'T REALLY EXPECT A WHOLE LOT FROM THEM IN THE END THEIR CONTRIBUTION AND THAT'S NOTED IN THE REPORT SO I RECOGNIZE THAT I'M NOT SAYING SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT. THAT'S A THAT'S A CONCERN. AND THEN FINALLY WE TALK ABOUT INVESTORS AND INVESTORS. CLEARLY CALIFORNIA'S NOW GOING TO BE AN INVESTOR WHAT IS OUR RATE OF RETURN. I'M JUST A ONE POINT ABOUT THE P. GINNY CONTRIBUTION. I THINK THERE ARE PROPOSALS OUT THERE. FROM INVESTORS AND BOND HOLDERS -- REGARDING HOW THEY MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOLUTIONS OF THOSE ARE MY PROPOSALS TO BRING FORWARD AND THEY WERE NOT SUBMITTED TO OUR RECORD -- AND BUT I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION ASKING I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME POSSIBILITIES I EVEN WITHIN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS. TO HAVE P. JEANNIE BEAR THEIR SHARE OF THE RISK AND COST SO I'D JUST LIKE TO RESPOND TO YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE I THINK YOU. ARE YOUR COMMENT AND MARRIED WITH -- SOMEONE MAYES YOU FOR YOUR YOUR POINT OF VIEW IS. ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL A LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE WITH IT. AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO FACE UP TO THE QUESTION OF WHO PAYS AND IF THE POINT OF VIEW IS WE REALLY WANT TO PRIORITIZE THE VICTIMS. AND TO GIVE THEM RIGHTS THAT ARM AB THIS INVERSE RIGHT AND AT THIS COST WHO SHOULD PAY FOR IT. AND I CAN JUST TELL YOU MY POINT OF VIEW. I THINK IF WE JUST IF THE STATE DECIDES TO DO THIS AND IT'S YOUR JOB NOT OURS. I THINK THE TAXPAYERS SHOULD PAY. THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE RATE PAYERS CAN PAY THE RATE THE THE COST OF THIS. NO MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT. THE THE WE CAN GET ONLY SO MUCH BLOOD FROM THE STONE WE CAN BANKRUPT UTILITIES. THAT'S FINE BUT THEN THE RATE PAYERS PAY AND YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE I BEEN THROUGH THE POINT WHERE THE RATE PAYERS WHERE I WENT TO SAN DIEGO ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE RATE PAYERS WERE WRITING. BECAUSE THEY WERE SO UPSET ABOUT THE RATES. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT INFLECTION POINT IN THE STATE WE HAVE TO DECIDE IF IT IS YOUR DECISION. THAT YOU WISH TO KEEP THIS COST. YOU CAN ARGUE YOU CAN DECIDE WILL GOING TO KEEP IT TO THE BANK FOR THE UTILITIES BANKRUPT BUT YOU'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF MONEY TO THE UTILITIES WILL BE BANKRUPT. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WHO PAYS AND IT IS BY RESPECTFUL OBSERVATION THAT THE RATE PAYERS. CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY ANYMORE THEY ARE READY AND HAVE TO PAY TO GET THE SYSTEM BETTER THEY'RE READY COULD HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR ENERGY GOALS WE WERE READY ASK HIM TO PAY FOR A CLIMATE GOALS. THEY CAN'T PAY ANYMORE SO IF YOU IN YOUR WISDOM DECIDE TO KEEP THE INVERSE. THEN FINE THEN MAKE THAT THE DECISION OF THE STATE AND HAVE THE TAXPAYERS PAY I DO THINK I AM VERY SKEPTICAL. OF ANY OTHER WAY I DON'T SEE HOW THE WE ALREADY HAVE INVERSE. WE WE HAVE WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN UNPAID FOR INVERSE IF WE WE WE HAVEN'T FACED UP TO THE ISSUE. OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IF WE HAVE A TERRIBLE FIRE EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE WERE FACING UP TO WRITE BUT I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT RIGHT I THINK I THINK THE BROADER POINT THAT. I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I CAN REALLY SPEAK OF A LOT ABOUT AYE NUMBERS. THAT THE POINT INVERSE CONDEMNATION ASSUMES THAT YOU CAN PROBABLY SOCIALIZE THE COST --% THAT AT TIMES IS INTENTION AND EVEN CONFLICT WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I TO SURE THAT RATES ARE JUST AND REASONABLE AND A BROADER MISSION TO ENSURE THAT THERE AFFORDABLE AND SO WE'RE AT THE INTERSECTION OF THAT CHALLENGE OUR REPORT NOTES A. P. YOU SEE REPORT THAT JUST CAME OUT SB. SIX NINETY FIVE REPORT WHICH TALKS ABOUT HOW RATES ARE GOING UP IN THE STATE FOR A HOST OF REASONS AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS QUESTION AND REALLY ABOUT COULD THE RATE PAYERS ABSORB THIS. THE INPUT WE GOT WAS NO AND SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES THEN WHAT. AND AND JUST SO TOOK MAKE THE POINT WE DID HAVE TESTIMONY. THAT THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEIR LECTURES CITY NOW UNDER NOT GETTING IT. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND IF WE MAKE THE RATES SO MUCH MORE HIGH WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS PEOPLE WILL WITHDRAW YOUR THE ENERGY COMMITTEE YOU KNOW THAT. BETTER THAN I DO THE PEOPLE WITHDRAW FROM THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM AND THE RATES WILL GO UP ON A SMALLER BASE SO. IT'S NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE. WHO YOU WANT TO HAVE TO PAY BUT IT IS FOR ME TO POINT OUT IN A ROLE AS A COMMISSIONER THAT SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO PAY AND IN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT'S NOT EQUITABLE? TO MAKE THE THIS POLICY DECISION. ON THE BACKS OF THE RATE PAYERS IT'S PERFECTLY FAIR FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DECIDE TO SOCIALIZE ACOSTA AMONG ALL OF THE CITIZENS BECAUSE THIS IS A POLICY. SO IN ANSWER YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT INCENTIVES ASIAN. I I TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW I THINK THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL NUMBER THREE I THINK WE NEED A NEW SHERIFF. I THINK THAT AND I THINK THAT IT'S EXPRESSED IN OUR OUR IN IN MY PART OF THE REPORT. THE FEELING IS THAT THE CURRENT SHERIFF ISN'T DOING A VERY GOOD JOB AND IT'S NOT ITS ENTIRELY IT'S FALL THE P. YOU SOMETHING ABOUT SEPARATE GROUP YES. THE P. YOU SEE WAS SET UP CONSTITUTIONALLY TO REGULATE THE RAILROADS. WE HAVE A ONE HUNDRED YEARS WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS AND AN IN PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES. YOUR NEVER IN MY PERSONAL JUDGMENT IT'S JUST ME. BUT IT'S IN OUR REPORT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO MODIFY IT. TO MAKE IT RESPONSIVE TO AN EMERGENCY WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY AND SO. I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY WE NEED TO DO MORE WE CAN DO MORE BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT THIS. RAIL ROAD RATE MAKING INSTITUTION WHICH HAS GOT ALL THESE RULES OR REGULATIONS. THE THE POOR COMMISSIONERS -- ARE TREMENDOUSLY HAMSTRUNG BY THE WAY IT WORKS SO IN MY JUDGMENT THE ANSWER TO YOUR INSTEAD OF STATION QUESTION IS TO GET A NEW SHERIFF. MAKE IT ACTUALLY IN ITS LAID OUT EXPLICITLY IN OUR REPORT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THAT NEW SHERIFF WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO CRIMINALLY REFER. TO PROSECUTE THIS ASSEMBLY AND TO INCENTIVIZE WHERE IT SEEMS JUDGE ALL STOP ONCE WAS OUT OF ICE IF MY LIFE AND JUST. MAY I I JUST BECAUSE THIS IS COME UP A FEW TIMES -- IT'S REGARDING WHO SHOULD HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THESE WILL OF WILDFIRE MATTERS I I DO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW THAN COMMISSIONER CON ON THIS AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND HE'S ACKNOWLEDGE VERY WELL IN HIS SECTION THAT. WE HAVE DIFFERENT AND INCONSISTENT RULES ACROSS. FIFTY SEVEN UTILITIES THAT IS NOT NEW THAT IS OUR CIRCUMSTANCE FOR EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENS AND ENERGY REGULATION AND THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH MECHANISMS FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD IS REALLY CLEAR GUIDANCE ABOUT WHERE YOU WANT TO SEE CONFORMITY BETWEEN. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES. SO I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO BETTER SHARE BEST PRACTICES. BUT THE CHALLENGE BEFORE US HERE IT HAS EVEN GOTTEN TO THE POINT OF BEING ABOUT. WHAT? HOW MUCH TIME DOES THE ECONOMIC REGULATOR TAKE IN THIS CASE IT REALLY GETS BACK TO YOU WHOEVER IS LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE IS GOING TO BE FACED WITH THE SAME FUNDAMENTAL UNDERLYING FACTS? THAT WE HAVE A VERY BIG LIABILITY AND HAS TO BE PAID BY SOMEONE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO IS THE PERSON MAKING THAT DECISION AS YOU'VE JUST HIGHLIGHTED -- WHOEVER HAS TO MAKE THE DECISION AND STILL THE SAME QUESTION. AND SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS MORE ON FRIDAY BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE PERHAPS OTHER WAYS TO GO ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A FISHING REGULATION -- THAN CREATING A NEW. A QUASI JUDICIAL BODY. MY LAST QUESTION FROM A MIXTURE IT [inaudible] IS. THE BIG ISSUE NOW IS TAKING CARE OF THE VICTIMS. WITH A BANKRUPT -- UTILITY. SO THIS ISSUE OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION THE ISSUE THE NEW ELECTRIC UTILITY WILDFIRE BOARD. ALL OF THESE OTHER ISSUES. SEEMSTO ME ARE SECONDARY RIGHT NOW WE'RE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PUT TOGETHER FUND -- FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY. SO THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THOSE WERE VICTIMS NOW. IS WOULD THAT BE ACCURATE. I THINK TAKING CARE OF THE VICTIMS NOW IS IMPORTANT I'LL I'LL MAKE THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATION AND THOSE WHO ARE MORE DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS CAN. COMMENT ON THIS BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT TO GET OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. THERE NEEDS TO BE A UNDERSTANDING ABOUT. HOW THE SITUATION THAT GOT THE UTILITY INTO BANKRUPTCY WHEN NOT HAPPEN AGAIN? AND SO I DO THINK THE REFORMS COLLECTIVELY THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. ARE IMPORTANT FOR A DEMONSTRATION ABOUT WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT THE NEXT TIME AND SO I DO THINK THAT TAKING CARE OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN VICTIMS. IS TIED TO HOW YOU THINK ABOUT TAKING CARE OF VICTIMS GOING FORWARD -- THANK YEARS JUST SIGNALING TO MY CHAIR OF THAT JUST ONE FOLLOW UP THEM. BUT I I WAS. IF WE FIGURE OUT THIS. KIDDING. IF IF WE FIGURE OUT THIS FUND FOR NOW AND WE THEN WE HAVE NEW RULES FOR THE THE THE THE PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD. SO THAT THE UTILITY WHEN THEY REALLY HAVE BEEN PRUDENT. CAN THEN GO TO THE UC TO TRY TO GET THAT -- THEIR COST. SWITCHED OVER TO WERE. HANDED OVER TO THE RATE PAYERS -- IF WE HAVE THAT. I REALLY AM LOOKING FOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE NOT SAYING WITH THE COMMISSION IS NOT SAYING IS THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION. WE GOT TO GET RID OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION THAT'S THE THE CURE ALL FOR ALL OF OUR ILLS BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY IS NOT I THINK THAT THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION CAUSES ENORMOUS COST IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO THE WITH THE BECAUSE THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS WE HAVE TO DO WITH THE EFFECT WE CAN'T LEAVE IT ALONE. BUT IF THE IF IN DEALING WITH A CAUSE IS OFF THE TABLE YOU MUST IDENTIFY A DEAL WITH THE AFFECT YOU CANNOT SAY. YOU BE DE WE LIKE INVERSE CONDEMNATION WALK AWAY FROM IT WE ARE FACING NOBODY LIKES IT IT'S JUST THE LAW FORGOT BUT BUT NEVERTHELESS THE POINT IS THAT WE'RE WE ARE NOT SAYING TO YOU. YEAH NOBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY TO YOU YOU MUST. DO THIS OR YOU MUST DO THAT IN TERMS OF THE DIRECTION. THAT STRIP THAT'S YOUR JOB ALL WE'RE SAYING TO YOU IS WORD PRESENT HE KNEW THE FACTS THE FACTS ARE INVERSE CONDEMNATION CAUSES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PROBLEMS. AND IF YOU WISH TO DEAL WITH THE AFFECT CARLOS SECTION OF THE REPORT IN ALL CARLOS GRAY THINKING IS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF DEALING WITH THE EFFECT. NOT DEALING WITH THE COSTS BUT THE CAUSE WAS THE FACT THAT THE UTILITIES WERE NOT DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT MA'AM IT GETS INVERSE CONDEMNATION THAT'S JUST ONE MORE PART PART TO IT. I I WILL LEAVE THEIR IT MEANT I MEANT TO SAY ONE THING I AGAIN NOT BEING A LAWYER I'LL GIVE YOU MY OPINION INVERSE CONDEMNATION WHICH IS. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING. IT I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE HIGH LEVEL POINT THAT MISTER KHAN IS MAKING BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT EVEN WITH REFORM. THERE IS STILL OPPORTUNITY TO LITIGATE THESE ISSUES IN COURT AND SO. THEREFORE YOU WILL SEE POTENTIALLY APPLICATIONS FOR COST RECOVERY STILL COMING TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION EVEN IF YOU CHANGE THAT STANDARD. AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS I THINK ALL AT LEAST THREE TYPES OF RECOMMENDATIONS. ASH CAN AND SHOULD BE DONE IN COMPLEMENT HOW BIG A A FUNDER AFFECTED WE NEED I THINK WOULD BE AFFECTED BY -- WHETHER YOU'RE CHANGING FIRST OR NOT BUT I AGREE THAT IT IS NOT A CATCH ALL. AND THAT WE DID HAVE A STAKEHOLDERS TO RAISE CONCERN ABOUT THAT CHANGE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. JUST ONE MORE QUESTION NO JUST DR. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY TO FALL. THIS WAS A THANK YOU THE CHAIR FOR THE OPTING TO BE HERE I'M NOT ON THIS COMMITTEE -- I WAS ON THE NINE ONE COMMISSION A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND WAS FROM A COMMUNITY THAT WAS DEVASTATED BY THE TUBS FIRE AND SO -- THINGS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS. INSURANCE FIRST AND THEN. WELFARE RISK GOING FORWARD SO. WITH REGARDS TO INSURANCE AND PERSONAL THE THOROUGHNESS OF YOUR REPORT IS IS -- IS IS REALLY WONDERFUL AND AND THE READABILITY IS IS IS MUCH APPRECIATED -- YOU TALKED ABOUT WE'RE NOT A CRISIS YET -- IN REGARDING -- PEOPLE LOSING INSURANCE AND I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT. IF YOUR NEIGHBOR LOSES HIS INSURANCE IS NOT A BIG DEAL YOU YOU LOSE YOUR INSURANCE THAT'S A CRISIS. THE NUMBER THERE'S A SURGE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. GOING TO THE FAIR PLAN WE'RE PRETTY DARN CLOSE TO A CRISIS. A WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE ZIP CODES. LOSING THEIR INSURANCE REGARDLESS OF THE PROPERTY IN THE INSURANCE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE TAKEN EFFORTS. TO TO TRY TO MITIGATE FIRE RISK WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT'S GOING TO SPREAD. LIKE A VIRUS POTENTIALLY -- THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO I JUST I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE I WILL SAY TO THAT. WHAT HAS BEEN MISSING FROM PART OF OUR CONVERSATIONS -- WITH REGARDS TO INSURANCE. IS THAT SHOULD PEOPLE TAKE EFFORTS TO REDUCE RISKS WHERE WILL INSURANCE BE WILL THERE BE AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE THE POSITIVE BENEFITS OF INCENTIVIZE YOU TO HOMEOWNERS. IF THEY'RE DOING THE WORK AND THEY'RE LOSING THEIR INSURANCE THAT'S HARDLY AN INCENTIVE AND THAT IS THAT IS FRUSTRATING AND JUST SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS WHAT YOU SAID. RECOMMENDATION NUMBER FOURTEEN UNDER THIS HERE REQUIRE THAT THERE BE A VALID QUOTE FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE BEFORE ANY REAL ESTATE OFFER IS ACCEPTED. THAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT WOULD BE REALLY HARD TO GET PASSED IN THIS LEGISLATURE. I'M NOT AND AND AND MAYBE I'M WRONG. BUT YOU'RE NOT OKAY. WE USE YOUR RECOMMENDATION AND NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION YOU'RE DOING NOTHING TO IMPROVE INSURANCE CONDITIONS FOR THE STATE IS NOT A GOOD OPTION I COULDN'T I COULDN'T AGREE MORE AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED AND WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER IF WE ARE GOING TO IMPROVE FIRE RISK CONDITIONS. WE NEED THE INSURANCE SOME COMPANIES TO WORK WITH US ON THAT AND AND MIKE I I I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S OF CONCERN -- WITH REGARD TO THE REDUCTION OF WELFARE RISKING CALIFORNIA -- YOU TALK ABOUT AND RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDATION NUMBER SEVENTEEN AND THIS IS IN YOUR A SUMMER WORK PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT STATE INVESTMENTS IN PREVENTION MITIGATION EFFORTS NOW WE DID. PUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR LAST YEAR THE LA -- IN THEIR EIGHT AUGUST APRIL THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT RECOMMENDED TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION ON GROWING. AND THEY DIDN'T PUT AN END DATE ON THERE AS I RECALL IN THAT REPORT -- AND THEN THE GOVERNOR LIST LAST YEAR PUTTING ADDITIONAL MONEY -- THAT HELPS ME TO FEEL LIKE WE VALIDATED THE THE THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN FIRE AND WHILE FOR MEDICATION GOING FORWARD -- THE END MISTER KHAN YOU TALKED ABOUT A WILDFIRE BOARD FOR YOU TILL AT EASE -- BUT I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT A WILDFIRE BOARD FOR CITIZENS SORT PEOPLE OUT THERE TRYING. TO AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO AND THE REASON I CUT I BRING THAT UP IS -- YOU NUMBER. EIGHTEEN TALK TO SAYS TAKE ACTION TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. CONSISTENCY OF PRIVATE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE LAWS. A LOT OF FIRES HAVE BEEN IN THE S. R. RAY. AND SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S. OUR GREATEST THEIR JOBS BUT THEY'RE UNDER MANNED AND UNDERSTAFFED AND SO WHEN FIRE SEASON STARTS AND IF THERE'S A FIRE THOSE PEOPLE THEY'RE GOING OUT AND DOING PROPERTY INSPECTIONS AND AND AND TRAINING COURAGE PEOPLE TO DO THINGS. THEIR GOD. AND THEY DON'T THEY WON'T BE BACK FOR A LONG TIME. AND SO WE DO ANY TALK ABOUT RESOURCES WE NEED MANPOWER DEDICATED MANPOWER THEY CAN BE YEAR ROUND TO HELP WITH INSPECTIONS TO HELP PEOPLE. N.. N. AS WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW IF. YOU LOOK AT COMMUNITIES OUT THERE WHO CAN MITIGATE FIRE RISK WEALTHY COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO DO WELL BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WEALTHY AND THAT THAT THAT MIGHT HELP. BUT POORER COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE. WITH THAT AND SO WHEN YOU DO THINGS LIKE FIRE HARDENING AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE IT'S EXPENSIVE. AND AND AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE AN PARTICULARLY IN AND POTENTIALLY IN THE A LOT OF THE S. R. AREAS. THAT THAT GETTING TO REDUCE THAT RISK IS GOING TO BE GOING TO BE CHALLENGING. I THINK YOU ADD -- TO AND MISTER MISTER PATTERSON IS NOT HERE HE TALKED ABOUT PRE POSITIONING AND YOU KNOW GET MORE FIREFIGHTERS OUT THERE I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION. AND AND THROWING MASSIVE RESOURCES AT THAT SO WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A HUGE YOU KNOW A MASSIVE MASSIVE FIREFIGHTING FORCE. THAT THAT WE FEEDING CLOSER THAN AND AND TAKE CARE OF FOR EVER I SO I'M I'M VERY MUCH IN THE PREVENTION PART OF IT. BUT SOME OF THIS GOES BACK TO A CONCERN THAT THAT THAT I HAVE -- THAT THAT OTHERS HAVE IS IS UTILITY BEHAVIOR. AND A TRUST IN THE UTILITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND I AM CONCERNED THAT AS WE GO FORWARD WITH THESE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. THAT. SOME UTILITIES MAY START TO TRY TO CUT CORNERS. AND THAT'S NOT THE BEHAVIOR WE WANT TO INCENTIVIZE. MATTER OF FACT WE NEED TO STOP THAT. IN ITS TRACKS IF WE BEGIN TO SEE SIGNS OF THAT. BECAUSE IT'S THAT BEHAVIOR CUTTING CORNERS THAT GODDESS PARTLY INTO THE MESS WE'RE IN NOW. AND SO WE DO NOT. TAKE ADVANTAGE AND AND AND PUSH BACK WHEN THEY'RE A TIME IF THERE'S A TEMP TO DOWNGRADE OF FIRE MITIGATION PLAN OR YOU KNOW THE LAST MOMENT MAYBE CHANGE SOMETHING IN -- AND AND NOT REALLY STUDY THE THE IMPACTS OF THAT WE NEED TO BE REALLY REALLY CAREFUL THAT SOMEBODY'S OUT THERE NOT TRYING TO PULL ONE OVER ON US AND PUT US AT FURTHER RISK SO -- WHY DON'T HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU -- THESE THESE ARE THESE ARE ARE MORE COMMENTS AND I BUT I DO I DO -- I DO APPRECIATE. MISTER KHAN SAID ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE COULD MARSHAL UP SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND REALLY ATTACK THIS AND GO BACK TO NONE OF US WERE HERE -- IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THIS HAPPENED BUT AFTER THE THE EARTH THE THE LARGE EARTHQUAKE AND NORTHRIDGE WE MARSHALL SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND NOW YOU SEE. CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM AND AND UPGRADES AND THINGS THAT HAPPEN PRETTY QUICKLY. WE NEED I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT FOR THIS AS WELL. THANK YOU MAY I OFFER JUST A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS IN RESPONSE TO YOUR COMMENTS. FIRST SO I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP INSURANCE AND I KEEP GOING BACK TO HOW DO WE MANAGE RISK NORMALLY IT'S WITH INSURANCE RIGHT AND WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE IS THAT. THESE THIS RISK IS SO GREAT THAT INSURANCE MARKETS INCREASINGLY DON'T WANT TO COVER IT. AND THE INSURANCE MARKET FOR THE UTILITIES THEMSELVES AND CRISIS SO AGAIN AT HISTORICALLY UTILITY INSURANCE HAS BEEN ABLE TO COVER THE COST OF THESE CLAIMS. IT NO LONGER IS ABLE TO DO SO AND THERE'S VERY FEW MAYBE ONE OR TWO INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WILL NOW WORK WITH UTILITIES AND WE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM A PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY THAT CANNOT GET INSURANCE -- AND SO THAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER AND SO THEN THAT LEADS TO HOW TO USE HOW DO WE GET THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY BACK INTO DOING WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO. HELPING MANAGE THIS RISK. AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM A COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES AND I IMAGINE IT'S THE SAME FOR RESIDENTIAL. IS THAT IF THERE CAN BE AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN THE RISK THEY ARE MORE WILLING TO COME AND PUT THEIR CAPITAL AT RISK BECAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR RIGHT NOW WHETHER WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A ONE A TWENTY YEAR EVENT OR ONE IN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR OF THAT. WHICH IS WHY ARE CHAPTER REALLY GETS INTO WIDE THE INABILITY TO MODEL UNDERSTAND THIS IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS RISK IT IS VERY HARD FOR INSURANCE TO PRICE IT SO THEY WON'T COME IN AT ANY PRICE POINT. SO WITH REGARD TO THE RECOMMENDATION TO INVEST MORE IN MITIGATION. IS PARTLY TIED TO THAT WHICH IS BOTH A DEMONSTRATION BY THE STATE TO INVEST AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN A MEDICATION I THINK WILL BE PERCEIVED POLICY POSITIVELY BY THE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL INSURANCE THAT. COMMUNITIES AND MAKE IT EASIER TO HAVE ACCESS TO INSURANCE -- WHAT THAT NUMBER IS? THAT SHOULD BE I CAN'T SAY ALL I CAN SAY IS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TEN YEARS FOR MITIGATION TO COME INTO AFFECTED SO IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THAT TIME LINE FASTER. OR HAVE THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE UTILITY EFFORTS THEN -- IT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT WHAT MORE DOLLARS IN THAT AREA WOULD DO. AND THEN I WANNA MAKE A LAST COMMENT ABOUT UTILITY BEHAVIOR AND THE CONCERN THERE AND THAT IS ALWAYS A CONCERN -- WHEN I? I DO NOT IT IS NOT IN THE UTILITIES INTERESTS TO HAVE WILD FIRES IT SIMPLY ISN'T EVEN IF THE COST GET RECOVERED THEY LOSE INVESTORS THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INVESTORS THIS IS NOT A SITUATION ANY UTILITY WANTS TO BE AN AND SO I THINK THERE IS SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE. TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE AND TO NOT CUT CORNERS. AND I WOULD KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A FULL REVIEW OF THE RECENT FIRES AND WHAT THE UTILITIES COULD HAVE OR SHOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY. AND SO I WANT TO RESERVE JUDGMENT ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE INTO THAT REVIEW IS DONE -- BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT ANY -- GAS ELECTRIC FOR EXAMPLE WHO IS HIGHLIGHTED FOR THE WORK THEY'VE DONE WHAT THEY'VE REALLY INVESTED IN ISN'T. SYSTEM HARDENING IT'S WILD FIRE DETECTION. COM AND THE ABILITY. TO TURN OFF THE SYSTEM TO DEACTIVATE THE SYSTEM WHEN THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR A FIRE. THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN. THE UTILITY INVESTING SIGNIFICANTLY AND SAFER POLES AND WIRES I DO WANT TO MAKE THAT DISTINCTION. THE THE P. YOU SEE THE LEGISLATURE TO NOT ORDER ALL UTILITIES TO FOLLOW THAT PATH -- ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ORDER THEM TO INVEST IN PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS AND SO I WANT TO BE SENSITIVE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT UTILITY BEHAVIOR. TO TO REALLY EXAMINE WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE DONE THAT VERSUS WHAT WE WISH THEY HAD DONE OR WISH WE WISH WE HAD ASKED THEM TO DO. SO I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT. EVERYTHING YOU SAID [inaudible] HI. IS THAT CODE IN A REPORT YOU'LL SEE SUBSTANTIATION PORT AN ASSEMBLY. WOMAN HIT REYES. ARM THE MOST HEARTBREAKING PART OF THIS PROCESS FOR THE COMMISSIONERS WAS TO HEAR FROM THE VICTIMS. AND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECTS OF BEING A VICTIM IS THE DEALING WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE YEAH I AND I'M SURE THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS I VISITED THE SITES AND TALK TO BUT TO THE VICTIMS. YOUR EVERYTHING YOU SAID WE CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH. F. BASE THIS IS A HORROR THIS IS A HUMAN HORROR AND WE HEARD FROM ONE PERSON WHO VICTIMIZE AFTER ANOTHER AND THE ESSENTIAL POINT YOU MADE IS REALLY CRITICAL. INSURANCE COMPANIES. FOR REASONS THAT I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND ARE NOT PROVIDING SATISFACTORY EXPERIENCE AS FAR CITIZENS THEY ARE VERY VERY UPSET AND FRUSTRATED. AND YOUR RIGHT ABOUT OUR STATE. ONE THING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING ABOUT HOW WE SERVICES FIRES. WE DO A GREAT JOB EVERYBODY SAYS IN TRYING TO RUSH IN AND STOP THEM. WE DO A GREAT JOB IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH PROVIDING SERVICES AND HELPING PEOPLE FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. AND THEN WE ABANDON THESE COMMUNITIES WE GIVE THEM PHONE NUMBERS THAT THEY CAN'T ANSWER WE GIVE THEM FOR NUMBERS WITH THE GET RECORDINGS WE GIVE THEM AGENCIES THAT DON'T GET FUNDED. AND SO JUST SO THE RECORD IS CLEAR. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY. WE ARE HEROES IN PREVENTION AND AND STOPPING IT WE ARE HEROES IN COMING IN AND HELPING PEOPLE AND THEN WE ARE OF THE BAND IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND THERE IS ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PAIN. AND SUFFERING THAT'S GOING ON FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT WE DISCOVERED AND THAT'S FOR US TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. AND JUST AS A FOLLOW UP THAT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU THINK OF THE CHAIR AND I DO APPRECIATE PROCEDURE KNOWLEDGE MEN OF THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M LIVING THROUGH WITH MY CONSTITUENTS. AND THAT IS THE FRUSTRATION THAT THAT -- YEAH WE'D WE BE THE FIRES OUT EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WENT HOME AND THEN A LOT OF OUR AGENCIES AND SUCH IT IS BEEN REALLY REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT AND AND IT IS A CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD -- I A COUPLE OF A COUPLE JUST POINTS AND THEN -- I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I I BELIEVE WE HAVE AS A STATE THE RESOURCES TO DO A MASSIVE MEDICATION -- PLAN -- WE WE USED MONEY FROM OUR G. G. R. F. FUND -- WHICH WAS NOT EASY AND IT WAS CONTROVERSIAL TO A LOT OF PEOPLE -- BUT THERE ARE RESOURCES THERE FOR PREVENTION AND PRIOR TO THAT YOU SAID THAT WE DON'T USED ABOUT 2% OF OF THAT MONEY FOR FIRE PREVENTION -- IF YOU YOU SPEND ANY TIME AROUND THE FIRE ZONES YOU SAW. THE HORRIBLE AIR QUALITY THAT WE EXPERIENCED IN THE MASSIVE RELEASE OF CARBON INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. QUITE FRANKLY I CAN THINK OF NO GREATER INVESTMENT IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS BY HELPING TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT -- AND I I HOPE THAT WE CONTINUE AND DOWN DOWN THE PATH TO DO THAT BUT WE ALSO -- AND IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME IS IS IS CHANGING BEHAVIOR. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO BE TOLD -- THAT THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT TO BE THAT I WANT TO CLEAR SOMETHING FROM AROUND THEIR HOUSE. THEY'RE THEY'RE ATTACHED TO THEIR FAVORITE TREE AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I I DO AND I BECAUSE I I AS I AM AS WELL -- BUT BUT INTO WE BEGAN TO TO FIND A WAY TO HELP PEOPLE CHANGE BEHAVIOR. THE RISK IN SOME AREAS IS NOT GOING TO GO DOWN. AND AND THAT IS THAT IS OF OF GRAVE CONCERN -- UP THERE BECAUSE PEOPLE SIMPLY ARE RESISTANT TO CHANGE CHANGING THEIR BEHAVIOR -- AND OUR ABILITY TO DO INSPECTIONS AND FOLLOW UP IS VERY LIMITED BY OUR LACK OF PERSONNEL THE CINEMA COUNTY TO THEIR CREDIT HIS NOW. MADE F. MAKING AN EFFORT TO TO EXAMINE OR TO DO INSPECTIONS ON THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED PROPERTIES THIS YEAR -- AND AND AROUND FIRE MITIGATION AROUND FIRE PROTECTION IN THE CITY THAT I USED TO LIVE IN. IF YOU DIDN'T DO YOUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THE FIRE EVENTUALLY CAN'T YOU GOT TAG YOU DIDN'T GET YOU DIDN'T RESPOND TO THAT THEY CAME IN THEY CLEANED IT UP AND THEY SENT YOU A BILL. BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT PROTECTING YOUR PROPERTY. IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU DO FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR AND YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST PROTECTED PROPERTY IN THE WORLD IF YOUR NEIGHBOR DOESN'T DO THAT YOU'RE AT RISK. IT'S MEANT YOU'RE A TERRIBLE RISK AND SO SO ANYWAY I'M SORRY GET OFF ON A SOAPBOX BUT THIS PART. TO ME IS IS IMPORTANT AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT -- HOW WE HOW WE WORK TOGETHER WITH INSURANCE IN THE FUTURE? HOW WE ENSURE THERE IS INSURANCE FOR PEOPLE AND JUST TO YOU UNDERSTAND HISTORY -- WE WE TRUST ME THERE WERE A LOT OF EFFORTS LAST YEAR AND MOST OF THEM MOST OF THEM DIDN'T GO VERY FAR QUITE FRANKLY. AND IT IS SO YOUR POINT. ABOUT THIS IS IMPORTANT BUT THE REALITY IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO INSTITUTE CHANGE. THANK YOU. BECAUSE TAKE A MOMENT TO RESPOND TO THAT TO ME BECAUSE WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE INSURANCE. A WORK GROUP MEMBERS HERE AND IS THIS ON THE PART OF A GOOD IF I COULD MAKE IT VERY BRIEF BECAUSE AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING IT'S NOT A COMMITTEE THAT HAS A JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER BUT ABSOLUTELY. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE INTO THE REPORT. THAT AND THAT IN PARTICULAR THAT WE'RE GROUP. RECOGNIZES THE CHANGES IN THE MARKETS I THINK AT THE MOMENT AND AND MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE WAY THAT THAT THE INDUSTRY IS REGULATED. TO HELP FORTIFY THAT MARKET TO FORTIFY BOTH AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY AND ONE OF THE KEY PIECES AS YOU SAID IT IS USING THOSE MARKETS TO INCENTIVIZE GOOD BEHAVIOR AND THE RECOMMENDATION NUMBER. IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AB. NO IN THE SECTION IT'S RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDATION SIX AND SEVEN IS TO LOOK AT SETTING STANDARDS BOTH FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY. MITIGATION THAT WOULD THEN BE PAID TO A REQUIREMENT FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO OFFER -- TO TO OFFER UP THAT POLICIES TO THOSE COMMITTEES A IF THEY MET BOTH OF THOSE STANDARDS AND I THINK THAT ADDRESSES A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF THIS QUESTION WHICH IS. HOW YOU INCENTIVIZE? GOOD BEHAVIOR. SO TO AND PUT THAT POOR APPRECIATE THAT. A MISTER CUNNINGHAM. AND THEN -- IF I COULD IF THERE WERE WE WILL THEN MOVE. QUICKLY TO PUBLIC COMMENT SO ON THE SECOND. NO I THINK -- I DON'T THINK ANY OTHER MEMBER. I HAD A QUESTION SO WILL TURN TO YOU AND THEN WE'LL MOVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WITH RESPECT TO INVERSE SEEMS LIKE THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS. WELL THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS. BUT THERE'S THE CAN WE AS A LEGISLATURE DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE THAT. AS A POLICY MATTER AND THEN THERE'S THE SHOULD WAY WHICH IS A POLICY OF POLITICAL QUESTION WHICH IS VERY VERY DICEY. TO SAY THE LEAST BUT ON THAT CAN WE PIECE AND THIS IS JUST AN AND ONE PICK UP ON YOUR LEGAL ANALYSIS IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR OPINION IF I FOLLOWED IT CORRECTLY IS. THAT WELL IN VERSE HAS SOME ROOTS IN THE CONSTITUTION IT WAS A CREATURE OF JUDICIAL CONSTRUCTION WITH BY TWO APPELLATE COURTS OF THE SIX INTERMEDIATE LEVEL APPELLATE COURTS IN THE STATE. IT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESS CORRECT BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. AND THEREFORE OUR OPINION I BELIEVE IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY IS THAT IT COULD BE ALTERED BY LEGISLATIVE ACTION. WHAT I DIDN'T FALL THOUGH IS -- YOU HAVE THAT WERE CORRECT SO FAR YES OKAY CORRECT I WOULD SAY THAT. COM THAT'S CORRECT AND ALSO I THINK VERY IMPORTANTLY. ON IT WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE CONTEXT. THAT WE ARE FACING. THERE ARE TWO THINGS WHAT WAS IT IT WAS ADDRESSED IN THE CONTEXT OF A MONOPOLY IT UTILITIES BEFORE WE DE REGULATED. AND IT WAS ADDRESSED NOT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EMERGENCY AND THE REASON THAT MATTERS IS BECAUSE THERE'S A LINE OF AUTHORITY IN THE FLOOD CASES. WHERE THE COURTS AT THAT AGAIN I ACKNOWLEDGE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO RESPOND TO A CNSOLIDATED EMERGENCY TO ALTER THE CONCEPTS OF INVERSE SO IS IT BECAUSE IF I FALL CORRECTLY IS A BECAUSE OF? THE EMERGENCY NATURE OF THE FIRE HAZARD THAT WE THE LEGISLATIVE. ACTION WOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT FEEL SO IF YOU ASK NINE LAWYERS YOU CAN GET. YOU KNOW EIGHT OPINIONS BUT I ONLY HAVE ONE GOOD ONE I'M TALKING TO RIGHT OKAY. WHAT WE ARE SURE WE RECEIVE WE RECEIVE IT WILL PASS ON TO YOU? EXTENSIVE LEGAL BRIEFING THAT SUPPORTED THE POSITION THAT YOU CAN DO THIS AND IT IS MY OPINION. HAVING BEEN A LAWYER HERE FOR FORTY SOME YEARS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE CAN ANNOUNCE A UNIQUE EMERGENCY AND CAN. STAND UP AND AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT THERE'S THE EMERGENCY AND THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A CONSOLIDATED RESPONSE TO IT. AND AND ORGANIZE THE STATE I BELIEVE AND THAT'S NOT A POLICY THAT'S ILLEGAL I BELIEVE YOU COULD DO THAT. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I IT IS MY BEST GUESS THE SUPREME COURT WOULD GO ALONG WITH THAT BECAUSE IT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR ANY SUPREME COURT UNITED STATES FOR CALIFORNIA. TO HAVE A GOVERNOR AND THE AND THE LEGISLATURE ANNOUNCE A GENUINE EMERGENCY AND FOR THOSE COURTS TO INTERFERE ESPECIALLY WHERE THEY HAD NEVER. THE SUPREME COURT IS NEVER COMMENTED ON THIS AND I WILL MAKE THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATION IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. NO OTHER STATE DOES THIS FORTY NINE OTHER STATES HAVE CONSTITUTIONS THAT READ THE SAME WAY OURS DOES BUT NOBODY ELSE INTERPRETS THIS WAY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T DO IT THIS WAY. SO WE ARE ADOPTING A POLICY LEGALLY THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS ACCEPTED SO I THINK IF YOU GO TO THE SUPREME COURT AND YOU SAY IT'S A BLANK SLATE. FORTY NINE OTHER STATES DO WITH THE OTHER WAY YOU HAVE A BETTER CHANCE. OKAY I THINK ALABAMA HAS ITS I DON'T WANT. TO YEAH THE L. THAT WAS UNIQUE SITUATION BESIDES LAST TIME I LOOK WE DON'T FOLLOW ALABAMA MUCH. SO SO IT YOU'RE GET SO THIS WOULD. ALMOST CERTAINLY BE LITIGATED AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK ALLUDED. TO AND YOUR BELIEF IS WHEN IT WENT WHEN AS A GOES UP ON APPEAL. THAT WHEN AT BY THE TIME IT GOT TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. THE COURT WOULD A CENTURY SO SHOW DEFERENCE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ACTION BECAUSE IT'S NEVER ACTUALLY -- FORMALLY ENDORSED INVERSE I THINK THAT THE COURT WOULD SAY THAT ON AS IT THE S. SIDE. NOT TO BE YOU KNOW TO GRAVE ABOUT IT I THINK THE COURT WOULD SAY THAT THE CALIFORNIA IS NOT DISABLED FROM PROTECTING ITSELF. THAT WE HAVE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT AND WERE ALLOWED TO PROTECT OURSELVES I ALSO BELIEVE THAT ARE THERE ARE LEGAL EXPERTS AVAILABLE TO YOU -- ARE THAT CAN THAT THAT AGREE WITH MY POSITION I I THINK THAT ARE THERE PEOPLE DISAGREE I ALSO THINK THERE'S WAYS THAT WE COULD EXPEDITE ARM OUR REVIEW ON THIS. ARM AND THERE'S ALSO A REMOTE POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DEAL WITH THIS WILL DECIDE NOT TO HARM. A OPPOSE SO I THINK IT'S DOABLE I'VE I'M NOT. SO ON THAT FOR YOU COULD I AND I DON'T WANT. TO NO BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A PRETTY GOOD AROUND ABOUT ON THE IN PERSON I DON'T WANT TO CUT YOU OFF FROM THE POINT YOU WANT TO MAKE BUT I THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT. ONE OF THE COURT WAS ASKED TO LOOK AT IT A REFUSE. TO THIS -- STATEMENT THAT I READ FROM THE GOVERNOR STATE OF THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM AND ASSEMBLY SPEAKER. ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT AS AN AREA WHERE WE WOULD BE FOCUSING ON IN THIS IMMEDIATE MOMENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE URGENCY ISSUES OF STABILIZING UTILITIES. IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IF WE DON'T. LOOK AT IT DOWN THE ROAD AND TRY TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME GETTING OUR ARMS AROUND THE ISSUE -- BUT THOSE ARE NOT THE POINTS THAT I AM TAKING MY READ FROM AS I HEAR THEM SPEAK ABOUT. THE LANES THAT WILL HAVE TO OPERATE IN IT WILL HAVE SOME MAJOR LISTING TO ADDRESS THE THE CHALLENGES IN THOSE LANES -- AS IT RELATES TO BRIDGE FINANCING -- PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD. AND ALLOWING COST RECOVERY. THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT. A AND AND I JUST SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO. THAT -- I'M NOT I'M NOT TRYING TO PRECLUDE AND THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET A PREVIEW AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE COULD YOU GO TO SAID NOW YOU COULD HAVE SAID NO WE HAVE [inaudible] TO WELL [inaudible] WELL. NO YOU REALLY COULD. BUT BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE WAS AN OPTION THAT THAT YOU STILL HAVE ANOTHER STEP TO YOUR PROCESS TO GO AND WE'RE TRYING TO BE RESPECTFUL. OF THAT -- SO. CONTINUE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE AND DEBATE AROUND INVERSE IS CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE I JUST WANT. TO GIVE THE MEMBER AN OPPORTUNIST SORT OF GET -- TO FINISHING HIS LINE OF QUESTIONING ON IT. BUT ALSO THEN BE ABLE -- TO TURN TO THINK MISS BURKE WHO ALSO HAD A QUESTION. OKAY -- AND THEN I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO GET TO THE THE PUBLIC -- TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO SORT OF SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS AND WHAT THEY'RE HEARING FOR ONE MINUTE JUST ONE MORE QUESTION SURE DEFINITELY. YEAH NO I THOUGHT I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING LEGAL ANALYSIS NOBODY'S EVER PERCENT OF THAT BEFORE I THOUGHT THAT WAS. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE I WOULD UNDERSTAND CLEARLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. PUSHING BACK THE LITTLE BIT ON EITHER THAT WOULD REALLY BE A CURE ALL IT OCCURS TO ME THAT IF YOU MOVE TO FALL BASED STANDARD. AT LEAST WITH RESPECT THE P. JEANNIE HISTORY. ARE THERE STILL SOME MASSIVE WILDFIRE INDUCED LOSS. THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE AT FAULT. FOR SO I DON'T. NO IF IF WE'RE GONNA TRY TO LIFT THE HEAVIEST THING AROUND WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALLY -- A A WORTH PUTTING IN THAT EFFORT TO SECURE IS YOU'RE PROBABLY VERY WELL TAKEN YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE NO CURE ALLS THAT'S WHAT CARL SAID ACCORDING EIGHTY APPROACH NEEDED. IF AN NSA. I THINK IT HAS BEEN HELPFUL FAR REPORT. TO TALK ABOUT INVERSE CONDEMNATION BECAUSE THAT PUTS INTO CONTEXT WHY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA IS VIEWED AS RISK HERE. AND WHY WE ARE SEEING INCREASED COST AND RATING AGENCY INVESTOR CONCERNS -- WHICH I KNOW HAS BEEN A KEY CONSIDERATION AND AFFECTS US WELL WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT COST RECOVERY IN THE FIND AND SO THAT'S WHY WE CONTINUE TO INCLUDE THAT TOPIC IN OUR DISCUSSION WHILE RECOGNIZING. THAT IS YOUR PREROGATIVE ABOUT WHETHER TO PURSUE SOMETHING AT THIS TIME. OKAY -- IS BURKE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT TO AND AND MY QUESTION IS MUCH LESS PROFOUND AND MOST OF THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN TODAY -- I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENT THAT IT'S A COORDINATED APPROACH AND I THINK SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION SOMETIMES YOU HEAR FROM OUR MEMBERS IS. BECAUSE WE ALWAYS COME BACK TO THIS UTILITY FINDING AND YOU KNOW WHO'S GONNA PAY AND AND I THINK THAT THE REPAIRS ARE THE TAXPAYERS WHOEVER. YOU TALK ABOUT THEY HAVE CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS THEY HAD EXPECTATIONS THAT THEY PAID THEIR RATES AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE SAFE UTILITY AND THAT. THEY PAID FOR IT ALREADY AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A MORE CORNING APPROACH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- OR IT WOULD BE GREAT AS YOU GUYS CONTINUE TO TALK. IS IS THAT YOU DISCUSS WHAT WHAT ELSE WERE REALLY PROVIDING THEM WHAT WHAT ELSE IF FOR ASKING THEM FOR MORE WHAT. IN ADDITION ARE WE GOING TO PROVIDE THEM WITH AND WHAT KIND OF GUARANTEES ARE WE REALLY LOOKING AT PROVIDING THEM WITH. BUT MY BIG MY ACTUAL REAL QUESTION IS NOT ABOUT INSURANCE IN GENERAL BECAUSE THEY THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION TO HAVE ABOUT FAIR PLAN AND WHETHER IT'S TIME FOR FAIR PLAN TO OF ALL OF OR THE HIGH RISK INSURANCE A MINUTE MARKET WHAT. DO WE DO ABOUT THAT BUT ACTUALLY ABOUT I OWE YOU INSURANCE WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO MENTION -- WHEN YOU HAVE LOOKED AT INSURANCE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT I -- USE HAVE HAD DIFFICULTIES AMPERE USE GETTING INSURANCE BUT WHEN YOU HAVE LOOKED AT THAT HAS THAT BEEN AT THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE THAT THE TRADITIONALLY PAY OR HAVE YOU ACTUALLY LOOKED AT IF WE INCREASE THEIR DEDUCTIBLE WHICH BY THE WAY IS A SAVINGS TO REPAIRS BECAUSE INSURANCE IS. PASSED ON TO REPAIRS HAVE WE LOOKED AT WHAT THAT WITH WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE -- IF WE INCREASE OUR DEDUCTIBLE AND AND IS IF IF THERE IS INSURANCE MORE AVAILABLE AT THAT IN DOING THAT. THAT'S A GREAT RECOMMENDATION AND WE OFFER SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE REPORT THAT YOU HAVE A HIGHER DEDUCTIBLE -- I DON'T RECALL WITH AXE THAT EXACT QUESTION BUT IN TERMS OF THE TESTIMONY WE'VE GOTTEN FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES. THEY SIMPLY SAY THERE IS NOT THE CAPACITY IN THE MARKET TO COVER LIABILITIES THAT ARE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THE MOST A UTILITY CAN GET RIGHT NOW IS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. AND SO I ASK THE QUESTION IS THERE ENOUGH INSURANCE OUT THERE AND WHAT I'VE HEARD IS NO. WE'VE HEARD THAT IF THERE IS SOME TYPE OF FUNDER SUPPORT FOR LIABILITIES FROM TWO BILLION TO TWENTY BILLION THEN THEIR INSURANCE MARKETS THAT MY KICK IN FOR THE REAL REAL TALE RISK OVER TWENTY BUT IT REALLY GETS BACK TO YOU IF IT IS A ONE A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YOUR SITUATION. WHAT WE JUST EXPERIENCE THEN I THINK YOU HAVE INSURANCE BUT IF IT'S SOMEONE IN TWENTY YEARS THEN THERE'S NOT THAT CAPACITY AT THE MOMENT? I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THE A MY UNDERSTAND FROM THE RECORD. HAVE TEST ME THEY RECEIVED WAS THAT IT WASN'T THAT DEDUCTIBLE THAT WAS SORT OF THE DESIGN OF THIS I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT CHAIRS AT THAT THAT WAS A GOOD DOCTOR WASN'T THE DECIDING FACTOR. CAM AND IMPACTED THE ATTACHMENT POINTS WEREN'T WEREN'T REALLY THE DECIDING FACTOR WAS. THE OVERALL RISK PROFILE THAT WAS DRIVING AND THE INABILITY TO GET INSURANCE. AND JUST -- ON THAT POINT. THERE ARE OTHER FINANCING MECHANISMS OF THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT TYPICALLY ARE USED TO DEAL CATASTROPHE IS LIKE. A CAT CATASTROPHE BONDS FOR EXAMPLE BUT WHAT WE KEPT COMING BACK TO IS THAT ALL THOSE OTHER MECHANISMS OUT THERE ARE REASONABLE WHEN YOU HAVE A LIABILITY OF A FEW HUNDRED MILLION ONCE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. TENS AND TENS OF BILLIONS. MANY OF THOSE MECHANISMS OF THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE NOT INVESTORS WHO WANNA WHO WANT TO TAKE THAT ON IT SO THAT'S WHY THE MORE WE CAN REDUCE. THE OVERALL LIABILITY THEN THE MORE MECHANISM THAT BECOME AVAILABLE TO US. NOT -- TO COPY EVERYBODY ELSE BUT I THINK I MIGHT. CAN HAS ONE MORE QUESTION OKAY -- SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IS THAT IF THERE WERE SOME FIND OR SOME SORT OF BRIDGE LIABILITY FIND WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE THEN THAT INITIAL INSURANCE WOULD BECOME MORE MORE AVAILABLE AND THEN IN THAT CASE SO WOULD THERE BE AN ISSUE IN RAISING. THE DUCK DOUBLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAYBE A VALUES FEEL PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY MORE SKIN IN THE GAME TEN MILLION DOES NOT A LOT OF SKIN IN THE GAME WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT FIRE IS THAT. EVEN SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION WHICH IS LIKE ONE OF OUR SMALLER ONES AT THIS POINT. IT SO I DON'T THINK THE CREATION OF A FUND MAKES INSURANCE MORE. AVAILABLE UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO GET PERHAPS INSURANCE AT A HIGHER ATTACHMENT POINT BUT I THINK THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU SAID WHICH IS WHAT WHAT DO REPAIRS GET OUT OF THIS MEAN WHAT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS CAN BE HAVE A HIGHER DEDUCTIBLE ONE I HAVE TO BE I THINK WE RECOMMENDED A HUNDRED MILLION OR EVEN A FEW HUNDRED MILLION I MEAN I THINK THAT SOMETHING WORTH KEEPING ON THE TABLE BECAUSE EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS AND THAT IS SOMETHING. AS YOU KNOW THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO RATES AND SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT. OKAY WE'RE GONNA TAKE US SOME TIME NOW TO TURN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT -- WE'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO'D LIKE. TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE WILL -- REQUEST A MINUTE. TO A MINUTE FOR EACH PERSON SHOULD BE RETURNED WE JUST MISTER WELL IF YOU DON'T MIND THE THERE MAY BE SOMETHING. PLEASE FISHERMEN HOLDEN -- MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE PATRICK CALLUM REPRESENTING UP FROM THE ASHES. WE ARE REPRESENTING THE VICTIMS THE VICTIMS FROM THOMAS WOLSELEY NORTH BAY AND CAMP FIRE WE'RE ALSO REPRESENTING THE FORTY ONE LAW FIRMS. IF VICTIMS IS THE FOCUS AND FRANKLY I'M NOT HEARING THAT TODAY I'M LOOKING AT THE COMMISSION AND RESPOND TO THAT. THEN WHAT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT THE COMMISSION REPORT WE AGREE YOU NEED A GOING FORWARD WILDFIRE FINE. WE AGREE WITH MRS BURKE THAT YOU NEED A HIGHER DEDUCTIBLE. TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF LIKE AND HAVING A TEN DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE ON YOUR AUTO INSURANCE WE AGREE. AND HAVE PUT THAT WE PUT A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL OUT THERE ON THE FUND WE DON'T AGREE ON THE SIZE WE THINK IT'S SMALLER WE AGREE NAY NEW COST RECOVERY PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARDS WE PUT A VERY SPECIFIC PROPOSAL ON THAT TO HELP VICTIMS. WE AGREE YOU NEED MUCH MORE IN SAFETY WE AGREE WITH US TELL WHEN WHAT. THE STATE NEEDS TO STEP UP ALONG WITH THE AYE WHO'S AROUND SAFETY AND MITIGATION WE HAVE SOME PROPOSALS AROUND THAT. WHAT'S MISSING IS ANYTHING DEALING WITH SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN VICTIMS IS NOT PART OF THE REPORT. WE GET THE GOVERNOR THE SENATE PRO TEM THE INVERSE SHOULD NOT BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION WE DISAGREE COMPLETELY. N. VERSUS THIS WEED VENDORS FIGHT LAST YEAR IT DOESN'T SAVE YOU A DOLLAR IN THE FUTURE. IT HELD A STATE BY GOING A QUICKER PROCESS TO GET THE VICTIMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND IT IS COMPLETELY UNCONSTITUTIONAL WATER. AND THE INTENDED USE OF A POLL IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. CARE MARTIN ST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I I WANT TO THANK THE COMMISSION FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE WE'VE ATTENDED MANY OF THE MEETINGS OVER THE LAST. FEW MONTHS AND THEY HAVE HEARD FROM US DIRECTLY AND VICTIMS -- BUT WE ARE A LITTLE DISMAYED AND SOME OF THE FINDINGS IN THE REPORT -- AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED WE'RE FOCUSED ON SOLUTIONS AND WE THINK THAT CHANGES TO INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS NOT A SOLUTION THAT'S GOING TO BRING GREATER CERTAINTY. AT WAR UP PROTECT VICTIMS IN THIS MATTER WE WANT TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND GET TO WORK WE AGREED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S -- PRESS STATEMENT AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP THAT THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN THE NEAR TERM. AND ALSO WORK ON A FUND THAT PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO THE UTILITIES WHILE PROTECTING VICTIMS AND OF FOCUS ON SAFETY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CAREY PASSED MORE FOR CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS. FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THANK YOU TO THE COMMISSION. IT'S A REMARKABLY GOOD REPORT IS THAT IS THESE THINGS GO AND TO THIS HEARING TODAY WHICH WAS. AN AMAZINGLY INFORMATIVE ONE WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED BY YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WE OBVIOUSLY. ARE VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE AND INTERESTED IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS. UP. AS YOU COLUMN RATE PAYERS -- WE HAVE A LOT OF LOW INCOME SENIORS IN CALIFORNIA HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER STATE. AND MOST SENIORS ON FIXED INCOME SO THEY HAVE A VERY LIMITED ABILITY TO BE. ENGAGED BY HELPING PAY FOR THE PROBLEM THAT WE ALL FACE. UP MANY OTHERS ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO BEING IN THE CASUALTY FIGURES BECAUSE THEY HAVE. LIVE IN ISOLATION THEY HAVE. ARE -- MOBILITY CHALLENGES OR RELY ON MEDICAL DEVICES AND EQUIPMENT SO WITH THOSE COMMENTS I WOULD SIMPLY SAY. THIS IS NOW I THINK MOVING TO BE IN YOUR LAP CHAIRMAN HOLDEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND WE HOPE YOU YOU ALL ACT QUICKLY AND RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE SOME ACTION BEFORE WE ENTER ANOTHER WILDLIFE WILDFIRE SEASON THANKS. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANKS BAKER.

THIS WALL FOR CRISIS AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF OUR STATES REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IS IMPACTING BOTH INVESTOR OWNED PUBLIC UTILITIES THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK IN ALL OF THIS IS CALIFORNIANS. WE NEED TO A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT INCLUDES ENHANCED PREVENTION EFFORTS. AND MORE RESOURCES FOR FIRST RESPONDERS AND THERE IS NO QUESTION. THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ACT ON MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN SB NINE A ONE THE COMMISSION IS REPORTING INCLUDING THE NEED FOR CLEAR PREDICTABLE RULES.

OUR ELECTRIC BILLS ESSENTIALLY PAYING FOR THESE COSTS SO WE NEED TO BE A MINDFUL OF THAT I THINK WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE REPORT -- WHICH CORRECTLY DIAGNOSED THE FACTORS THAT PUT US INTO THIS MESS AND I THINK I'M CHARTER WAY OUT OF IT. BUT TO THE LEGISLATURE JUST ONE UNDERSCORE THAT THESE REFORMS DO WORK AS A PACKAGE AND IF LIABILITIES OFF THE TABLE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE OPTIONS LEFT ARE STILL GONNA PUT TREMENDOUS STRAIN.
