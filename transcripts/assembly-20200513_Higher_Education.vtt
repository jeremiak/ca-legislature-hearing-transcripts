THROUGH THE STATE COMPTROLLER

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:17.707
AND THE- GOVERNOR AND I'M NOT

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:18.408
QUITE SURE WHERE THE

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:21.277
LEGISLATURE- CAME IN ON THIS

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.580
LOWERED PRIZES AND EDUCATION

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:28.451
FROM 87% 84% AND REALLY

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:32.522
TROUBLING TO ME IS OVERHEAD FOR

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:36.692
THE LOTTERY. WENT FROM 30% 216%

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:39.162
THAT'S A 6% CHUNK OUT OF THE

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:41.464
MONEY THAT WAS GOING BASICALLY

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.633
THE EDUCATION THAT CONCERNS ME

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:46.602
GREATLY. ALSO THERE MAY BE A

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:49.238
QUESTION DOWN THE ROAD ABOUT

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:50.973
THE CONSTITUTIONALITY-

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.309
SPECIFICALLY AB ONE FORTY TWO

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:57.847
HIGH I SEE IN. TWO THOUSAND

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:59.649
TEN. CHANGE THE LOTTERY WITHOUT

01:01:59.715 --> 01:02:01.317
A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE NOW

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.686
HOWEVER AB ONE FORTY TO

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.688
INCREASE PRIZE AWARDS SO IT'S

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:06.656
UNLIKELY THE PUBLIC WOULD HAVE

01:02:06.722 --> 01:02:09.926
SUED SO THE LEGISLATURE KIND OF

CHAIR AND ALSO THANK YOU TO THE

02:23:36.174 --> 02:23:38.042
AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS

02:23:38.109 --> 02:23:39.877
THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION I

02:23:39.944 --> 02:23:40.845
REALLY STRUGGLED WITH THIS

02:23:40.912 --> 02:23:44.182
BILL- I DON'T UNFORTUNATELY I'M

02:23:44.248 --> 02:23:45.750
GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT

02:23:45.817 --> 02:23:48.286
TODAY- I THINK THAT WHAT WE SAW

02:23:48.353 --> 02:23:50.722
THIS YEAR'S USE PROPOSAL WAS A

02:23:50.788 --> 02:23:54.525
WAY TO. ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT

02:23:54.592 --> 02:23:57.395
THE LEGISLATURE HAS ASKED OF IT

02:23:57.462 --> 02:23:59.597
WHICH IS TO SPEED UP GRADUATION

02:23:59.664 --> 02:24:01.699
RATES AND SO THEY WANTED TO

02:24:01.766 --> 02:24:04.369
FIND A WAY TO PREPARE STUDENTS

02:24:04.435 --> 02:24:06.270
BETTER FOR WHEN THEY WOULD GET

02:24:06.337 --> 02:24:08.473
TO COLLEGE SO THAT THEY COULD-

02:24:08.539 --> 02:24:10.875
COMPLETE COLLEGE THEN DROPPING

02:24:10.942 --> 02:24:14.212
OUT. AND THEY SEND COMMUNITY

02:24:14.278 --> 02:24:16.314
WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHAT WE

02:24:16.381 --> 02:24:17.415
REALLY WANT OUR INSTITUTIONS TO

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:19.951
DO A PARTICULARLY LA U. S. D.

02:24:20.018 --> 02:24:22.520
WHICH SAID WE JUST SIMPLY CAN'T

02:24:22.587 --> 02:24:24.088
PROVIDE THESE CLASSES RIGHT NOW

02:24:24.155 --> 02:24:26.591
I WHICH IS VERY SAD TO HEAR US

02:24:26.657 --> 02:24:28.826
YES YOU HEARD THAT THEY CHANGED

02:24:28.893 --> 02:24:31.596
THEIR RECOMMENDATION AND- AND

02:24:31.662 --> 02:24:32.997
SO THEY'RE NOT IMPLEMENTING

02:24:33.064 --> 02:24:36.134
THAT REQUIREMENT- AT THE TIME

02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:37.702
THAT THEY WANTED TO. WHICH IS

02:24:37.769 --> 02:24:39.504
GOING TO HURT OUR ABILITY TO

02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:40.972
GET TO THE GRADUATION RATE GOAL

02:24:41.039 --> 02:24:42.473
THAT WE HAVE AND OF COURSE TO

02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:45.276
GET O. THE WORK FORCE THAT WE

02:24:45.343 --> 02:24:48.546
WANT CALIFORNIA TO HAVE. FOR

02:24:48.613 --> 02:24:50.381
THE FUTURE GENERATION OF

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:51.949
CALIFORNIAN THE ECONOMIC MIGHT

02:24:52.016 --> 02:24:53.551
OF THE STATE AND ENGAGE

02:24:53.618 --> 02:24:55.520
CITIZENRY. THAT THE STATE

02:24:55.586 --> 02:24:58.456
DESERVES. I WANT TO THROW OPEN

02:24:58.523 --> 02:25:01.592
THE GATES OF HIGHER EDUCATION

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:03.561
TO EVERYBODY. I ABSOLUTELY DO

02:25:03.628 --> 02:25:07.865
AND- AND SO WE HAVE AS AS- IN

02:25:07.932 --> 02:25:09.700
OUR JOBS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

02:25:09.767 --> 02:25:11.102
DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DO

02:25:11.169 --> 02:25:12.470
THAT CREATE MORE SEATS

02:25:12.537 --> 02:25:15.206
AVAILABLE AT CSU. AND YOU SEE

02:25:15.273 --> 02:25:17.942
AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:25:18.009 --> 02:25:20.278
AS AFFORDABLE AS IT CAN BE YOU

02:25:20.344 --> 02:25:22.013
KNOW FREE EXCEPT FOR YOUR COST

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:25.983
OF LIVING. AND I AND THERE ARE

02:25:26.050 --> 02:25:28.319
SO MANY WAYS FOR STUDENTS EVEN

02:25:28.386 --> 02:25:29.454
IF THEY DON'T MEET THIS

02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:31.489
QUANTITATIVE REASONING

02:25:31.556 --> 02:25:33.558
REQUIREMENT IF IT WAS IN PLACE.

02:25:33.624 --> 02:25:34.492
TO CONTINUE THROUGH WITH

02:25:34.559 --> 02:25:36.194
COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH IS

02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:37.361
PROBABLY THE SMARTEST

02:25:37.428 --> 02:25:39.597
EDUCATIONAL CHOICE ANY

02:25:39.664 --> 02:25:41.466
CALIFORNIAN CAN MAKE IS TO GO

02:25:41.532 --> 02:25:42.500
TO CATCH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:25:42.567 --> 02:25:44.836
FOR THEIR FIRST TWO YEARS. AND

02:25:44.902 --> 02:25:46.237
DIED AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE

02:25:46.304 --> 02:25:48.339
PARTICULARLY NOW IN LIGHT OF

02:25:48.406 --> 02:25:50.074
THE MOMENT THAT WERE IN. AND I

02:25:50.141 --> 02:25:52.310
SPEAK NOT JUST AS A POLICYMAKER

02:25:52.376 --> 02:25:54.212
BUT I SPEAK WITH SOMEONE WITH A

02:25:54.278 --> 02:25:56.647
GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE. WITH

02:25:56.714 --> 02:25:59.417
ROAD BLOCKS TO GRADUATION. I AM

02:25:59.484 --> 02:26:00.084
A GRADUATE OF CAL STATE

02:26:00.151 --> 02:26:02.954
NORTHRIDGE. AND I NEEDED TO

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:05.356
TAKE REMEDIAL MATH. WHEN I GOT

02:26:05.423 --> 02:26:06.624
TO CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE IT

02:26:06.691 --> 02:26:09.961
WASN'T A SURPRISE. I GRADUATED

02:26:10.027 --> 02:26:12.964
HIGH SCHOOL JUST FINE ON BUT-

02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:14.966
WHEN I TOOK ALGEBRA TWO MY

02:26:15.032 --> 02:26:20.071
TEACHER. WAS THE FOOTBALL COACH

02:26:20.138 --> 02:26:22.940
AND THE P. E. TEACHER. AND HE

02:26:23.007 --> 02:26:23.741
WAS A REALLY GOOD DRIVERS ED

02:26:23.808 --> 02:26:25.877
TEACHER I HAD AN FOR DRIVER

02:26:25.943 --> 02:26:28.646
SAID AS WELL. AND I IS THAT

02:26:28.713 --> 02:26:31.149
DRIVERS ED EXAM. NO MY KIDS

02:26:31.215 --> 02:26:35.386
MIGHT THINK I DIDN'T. BUT I DID

02:26:35.453 --> 02:26:36.554
NOT GET PREPARED FOR COLLEGE

02:26:36.621 --> 02:26:39.624
LEVEL MATH. SHOCKER AND THAT'S

02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:41.125
A STORY THAT I THINK A LOT OF

02:26:41.192 --> 02:26:43.628
STUDENTS HAVE. ANY EXPERIENCE I

02:26:43.694 --> 02:26:45.429
THINK THAT THIS YES YOU LISTEN

02:26:45.496 --> 02:26:47.265
TO L. L. U. S. T. I. I DIDN'T

02:26:47.331 --> 02:26:51.936
GO TO LAUSD SCHOOL- BUT- THAT

02:26:52.003 --> 02:26:54.305
STUDENTS AREN'T GETTING THE

02:26:54.372 --> 02:26:54.906
PREPARATION THEY NEED IN HIGH

02:26:54.972 --> 02:26:58.342
SCHOOL. AND SO NOW THE CSU IS

02:26:58.409 --> 02:26:59.510
DEALING WITH THAT CHALLENGE

02:26:59.577 --> 02:27:00.578
THEY DEALT WITH IT WHERE I HAD

02:27:00.645 --> 02:27:03.347
TO. TAKE REMEDIAL MATH ANY

02:27:03.414 --> 02:27:04.949
NUMBER OF TIMES BECAUSE I DID

02:27:05.016 --> 02:27:06.984
DROP OUT A FEW TIMES I

02:27:07.051 --> 02:27:09.320
ACTUALLY. DID NOT PASS IT THE

02:27:09.387 --> 02:27:11.155
FIRST TIME I TOOK IT I FINALLY

02:27:11.222 --> 02:27:12.490
TOOK COLLEGE LEVEL MATH THE

02:27:12.557 --> 02:27:14.525
FALL OF MY SENIOR YEAR I PUT IT

02:27:14.592 --> 02:27:16.327
OFF AND PUT IT OFF. I DID JUST

02:27:16.394 --> 02:27:20.364
FINE. I DID JUST FINDING

02:27:20.431 --> 02:27:20.998
BECAUSE OF HIM ACTUALLY ENJOYED

02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:25.236
THE CLASS BUT- BUT THIS YES YOU

02:27:25.303 --> 02:27:27.038
LISTEN TO THAT EXPERIENCE AND

02:27:27.104 --> 02:27:28.873
SAID THIS ISN'T HELPING OUR

02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:31.008
STUDENTS GRADUATE AND IN FACT

02:27:31.075 --> 02:27:34.111
WE CAN TEACH ALL OF THEM- AT AT

02:27:34.178 --> 02:27:36.314
A COLLEGE LEVEL WITHOUT MAKING

02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:38.716
AND TAKE WHAT ESSENTIALLY WAS A

02:27:38.783 --> 02:27:41.052
AN OBSTACLE COURSE FOR ME. I

02:27:41.118 --> 02:27:43.387
WHERE I HAD TO SPEND MONEY ON

02:27:43.454 --> 02:27:43.955
CLASSES THAT DID NOT GIVE ME

02:27:44.021 --> 02:27:46.390
COLLEGE CREDIT. AND SLOWED DOWN

02:27:46.457 --> 02:27:48.459
AND SLOW DOWN HUNDREDS OF

02:27:48.526 --> 02:27:49.460
THOUSANDS PROBABLY OVER THE

02:27:49.527 --> 02:27:51.529
YEARS OF STUDENTS. FROM

02:27:51.596 --> 02:27:53.064
GRADUATING AND TIMELY MANNER.

02:27:53.130 --> 02:27:54.565
SO I BELIEVE THIS ISSUE IS

02:27:54.632 --> 02:27:56.767
DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN. THE

02:27:56.834 --> 02:27:58.536
SERVICE POPULATION. WILL

02:27:58.603 --> 02:28:00.004
CALIFORNIA POPULATION BUT IF

02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:01.939
YOU JUST LOOK AT THE DATA A

02:28:02.006 --> 02:28:03.407
PARTICULARLY OF OUR-

02:28:03.474 --> 02:28:05.009
UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IN

02:28:05.076 --> 02:28:07.178
CALIFORNIA THAT WE ARE DOING

02:28:07.245 --> 02:28:09.280
AMAZING IN GETTING MINORITY

02:28:09.347 --> 02:28:11.182
STUDENTS TO GRADUATE DEGREES

02:28:11.249 --> 02:28:14.719
THAT COME OUT OF THE CSU- SO.

02:28:14.785 --> 02:28:16.053
THEY'RE DOING THE THINGS THAT

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:18.823
WE'RE ASKING OF THEM AND

02:28:18.889 --> 02:28:19.857
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO

02:28:19.924 --> 02:28:21.125
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE WORK

02:28:21.192 --> 02:28:23.728
FOR. AND WE PEOPLE IN TIME AND

02:28:23.794 --> 02:28:25.129
IN FACT THEY'RE DOING AS WE

02:28:25.196 --> 02:28:26.197
HEARD ON THE CALL I DIDN'T EVEN

02:28:26.264 --> 02:28:27.365
MEET WITH THEM ABOUT THIS I

02:28:27.431 --> 02:28:28.165
JUST KNOW FROM PERSONAL

02:28:28.232 --> 02:28:29.900
EXPERIENCE AND WHAT I'VE READ

02:28:29.967 --> 02:28:30.801
THEY'RE DOING THE THINGS THAT

02:28:30.868 --> 02:28:31.902
WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO IN THIS

02:28:31.969 --> 02:28:33.638
BILL. I DON'T MIND BELTS AND

02:28:33.704 --> 02:28:35.740
SUSPENDERS- FOR GROUPS THAT WE

02:28:35.806 --> 02:28:38.109
DON'T TRUST ON I KNOW THIS

02:28:38.175 --> 02:28:38.943
YEAR'S HE'S WORKING REALLY HARD

02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:40.945
ON THIS ISSUE AND- AND THAT'S

02:28:41.012 --> 02:28:43.147
WHY TODAY AND REALLY SADLY YOU

02:28:43.214 --> 02:28:43.914
KNOW I WRESTLED WITH THIS

02:28:43.981 --> 02:28:46.350
OVERNIGHT I LISTEN TO. THE

02:28:46.417 --> 02:28:48.319
TESTIMONY AND FOR SOME NOT ABLE

02:28:48.386 --> 02:28:49.620
TO SUPPORT IT BUT I DO

02:28:49.687 --> 02:28:50.655
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION

02:28:50.721 --> 02:28:52.790
THAT WE'RE HAVING THE GOAL THAT

02:28:52.857 --> 02:28:55.126
WERE HAVING AND- OF MAKING SURE

02:28:55.192 --> 02:28:57.395
THAT THE DOORS TO HIGHER AT OUR

02:28:57.461 --> 02:28:58.596
OPEN EVERYONE. THANK YOU. THANK

02:28:58.663 --> 02:29:00.197
YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:02.667
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. YES I

02:29:02.733 --> 02:29:05.236
WANT TO THANK. OUR CHAIR FOR

02:29:05.303 --> 02:29:06.737
THIS BILL AND I'M ONE OF THE CO

02:29:06.804 --> 02:29:09.073
OP IS ON THE BILL AND I

02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:10.508
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY

02:29:10.574 --> 02:29:12.643
COLLEAGUE BECAUSE- IN MANY WAYS

02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:13.911
THEY ARE CORRECT TO THE EXTENT

02:29:13.978 --> 02:29:16.580
THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS-

02:29:16.647 --> 02:29:18.516
LISTENED EVENTUALLY TO THE

02:29:18.582 --> 02:29:20.051
AUDIENCE TO THE PUBLIC AND

02:29:20.117 --> 02:29:22.320
DECIDED TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION

02:29:22.386 --> 02:29:23.954
AND THAT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT.

02:29:24.021 --> 02:29:25.523
I GUESS THE PROBLEM COMES IN IS

02:29:25.589 --> 02:29:26.791
THAT THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

02:29:26.857 --> 02:29:28.693
ENERGY THAT WAS EXPENDED AND

02:29:28.759 --> 02:29:30.761
THE KIND OF ANXIETY CREATED AS

02:29:30.828 --> 02:29:32.229
A RESULT OF THEM NOT HAVING THE

02:29:32.296 --> 02:29:33.898
PROCESS AND NOT HAVING

02:29:33.964 --> 02:29:35.800
INCLUSION OF THE PUBLIC-

02:29:35.866 --> 02:29:37.535
COMMENTS AND RESEARCH IN

02:29:37.601 --> 02:29:38.803
ADVANCE RATHER THAN AFTER THE

02:29:38.869 --> 02:29:40.071
FACT YOU KNOW AFTER BEING

02:29:40.137 --> 02:29:42.006
PRESSURE AND THE KIND OF

02:29:42.073 --> 02:29:43.741
PUBLICITY AND ANXIETY THAT

02:29:43.808 --> 02:29:46.077
STUDENTS AND- AND STAFFERS HAD

02:29:46.143 --> 02:29:47.278
ABOUT THIS. WAS REALLY

02:29:47.345 --> 02:29:48.612
UNNECESSARY WITH THEIR IT

02:29:48.679 --> 02:29:49.847
ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS OF THE

02:29:49.914 --> 02:29:51.582
BEGINNING AND BASICALLY SOUGHT

02:29:51.649 --> 02:29:52.650
OUT THE INFORMATION THAT WAS

02:29:52.717 --> 02:29:54.518
NECESSARY THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE

02:29:54.585 --> 02:29:55.753
TO DEAL WITH THIS WOULD HAVE

02:29:55.820 --> 02:29:57.121
HAD HEARINGS ON IT HERE AT THE

02:29:57.188 --> 02:29:58.622
CAPITOL WOULD HAVE GONE TO ALL

02:29:58.689 --> 02:30:00.024
THESE THINGS IN THE HEARING TO

02:30:00.091 --> 02:30:01.726
REALLY WILL BY WERE BOB PROCESS

02:30:01.792 --> 02:30:02.727
AND WHETHER THAT THE RIGHT

02:30:02.793 --> 02:30:04.328
QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED. AND

02:30:04.395 --> 02:30:06.230
SO FORTH AND SO ON AND SO THIS

02:30:06.297 --> 02:30:07.765
BILL IS REALLY ABOUT NOT

02:30:07.832 --> 02:30:08.866
NECESSARILY CONDEMNING THE

02:30:08.933 --> 02:30:10.368
WOULD MAKING SURE THAT IN THE

02:30:10.434 --> 02:30:11.936
FUTURE IF THERE ARE CHANGES AND

02:30:12.002 --> 02:30:13.571
SHIFTS AND REQUIREMENTS THERE'S

02:30:13.637 --> 02:30:15.639
A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT DIDN'T

02:30:15.706 --> 02:30:17.408
DOES THIS SO THE WE DON'T FIND

02:30:17.475 --> 02:30:18.776
OURSELVES ONCE AGAIN HAVING

02:30:18.843 --> 02:30:20.144
LISTENED TO IT ON THE NEWS

02:30:20.211 --> 02:30:21.645
FIGURE OUT WHO DID WHAT SO

02:30:21.712 --> 02:30:23.180
FORTH AND SO ON BUT BASICALLY

02:30:23.247 --> 02:30:24.582
ADDRESSED THE ISSUE AS IT

02:30:24.648 --> 02:30:26.117
SHOULD BE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

02:30:26.183 --> 02:30:27.985
CORRECT THE C. ISSUED TO THE

02:30:28.052 --> 02:30:29.854
UC'S ARE WRESTLING WITH. ISSUE

02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:30.788
OF ADMISSIONS AND

02:30:30.855 --> 02:30:32.823
