FOR HIS ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE AND ALSO THANK COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE BUREAUOF CANNABIS CONTROL INDUCTED REGULATIONS TO CLARIFY PORTION OF THE LANGUAGE ADOPTED IN PROP SIXTY FOUR WITH RESPECT TO BILLBOARD ADVERTISING. LANGUAGE IN THE PROPOSITIONS STATES THE LICENSEE SHALL NOT ADVERTISED ON A BILLBOARD OR SIMILAR ADVERTISING DEVICE LOCATED ONINTERSTATE HIGHWAY OR IN THE STATE. OFF HIGHWAY WHICH CROSSES CALIFORNIA BORDER- THIS IS STRANGE LANGUAGE BECAUSE STATE HIGHWAYS DON'T CROSS THE BORDER. AND IT'S VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS. THE BUREAU CONCLUDED THAT PROP SIXTY FOUR DOES NOT CLARIFY TO WHAT EXTENT SUCH PROHIBITIONS WOULD TAKE PLACE- AND THEY DECIDED THAT A FIFTEEN MILE RADIUS FOR ANY HIGHWAY THAT GOES TO THE BORDER OF WEST APPROPRIATE. WHEN THE BEARS REGULATIONS WERE CHALLENGED IN COURT YOUR ARGUED THE PRIMARY INTENT OF THE HIGHWAY LANGUAGE IN PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS TO AVOID RUNNING AFOUL OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUED. CLASSIFICATION OF CANNABIS AS A SCHEDULE ONE CONTROLLED DEVICE SO THE IDEA WAS- THAT YOU WOULDN'T ADVERTISE IN ANOTHER STATE- CANNABIS ADVERTISING IS ALREADY EXTREMELY RESTRICTED IN CALIFORNIA. STATUTE AND REGULATIONS SPECIFY THAT ADVERTISEMENTS CANNOT BE ATTRACTIVE TO AN AUDIENCE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. INCLUDES A PROHIBITION ON CONTACT CARTOON CHARACTERS IMAGES OF ANYONE UNDER TWENTY ONE AND TOYS- THE DECISION ISSUED BY THE JUDGE IN THE FORMER CASE- PROHIBITS. ALL ADVERTISING ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS SUCH AS I. FIVE AND FIVE EIGHTY BECAUSE THEY CROSSED THE CALIFORNIA BORDER HOWEVER IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT IT ON. TWO EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY AT SEVERAL- IT IS NOT A LOGICAL INTERPRETATION WE'VE TALKED TO THE LAWYERS IN THIS CASE- WHO WERE LOOKING AT THE PROPOSITION THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS. LANGUAGE GOT THERE AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE INTENT WAS. IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT CLOSING THE DOOR ON THE ILLICIT MARKET WHICH IS WHERE MINERS GET THE ACCESS TO CANNABIS WITH UNKNOWN CONTAMINANTS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A LITTLE LEGAL MARKET THAT WILL GROW THRIVE OUTCOMPETE THE ILLEGAL MARKET.

I HAVE MANY ISSUES BROUGH UP SURROUNDED BY TOBACCO BILLBOARDS ONLY THE TOBACCO MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT DOCTORS OUT OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN SWAYS. ALLOWING CANNABIS BILLBOARDS BACK ON OUR HIGHWAYS WAS A HISTORIC REGULATORY FALLOUT. IT BROKE PROP SIXTY FOUR PROMISES TO VOTERS TOLD THAT THE STATE WOULD IMPLEMENT THE STATE OF THE NATION'S STRICTEST CHILD PROTECTIONS. INCLUDING ADVERTISING AND BILLBOARD RESTRICTIONS. THIS PROMISE WAS BROKEN BY STATE REGULATIONS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO AB THIRTEEN OH TWO. RECENTLY HELP VIOLATE STATE LAW BY THE COURT. BY THE BLATANT EXAMPLE OF REGULATORY CAPTURE NOT CLARIFICATION WITHIN AFFECT. THE STATE CAN. LIKELY BE AT OUR REQUEST AND ACTING UPON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF ITS COMMITTEE ON HOUSTON PUBLIC HEALTH. RECOMMENDED RETURNED TO THE LANGUAGE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR. BILLBOARDS ARE NOT NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND IT IS. TRUE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST RESTRICTIVE LAWS IN THE NATION. OR THE BILLBOARD. RESTRICTIONS DON'T EXIST ELSEWHERE. CANCER RECENTLY A 8% IN IN CANNABIS YOU BY. CHANGED TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE OUTCOME OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO SCHOOL HIGHER GETTING HIGH SCHOOL. A PROBLEM EVERY HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE IS SEEING. THEIR SHOWING UP IN THE ER WITH CANNABIS RELATED PSYCHOSIS FROM ALT APPROPRIATE PRODUCTS LIKE PRETTY BATES ADVERTISED ON OUR HIGHWAYS. AND ALL OF YOU SAW OUR HIGHWAYS WERE LITTERED IN CANADA SAID TO EXPOSING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN IN. EVERY DAY ON THEIR WAY TO SCHOOL OR HOME. THIS IS WELL DOCUMENTED TO INCREASE USED INTERESTS AND USED IN THESE PRODUCTS. BY OTHER MEDIA CAN USE AUDIO COMP- ORIENTS COMPOSITION DATA THERE IS NO. BILLBOARDS WITHOUT USING EXPOSURE.

IMPLIED COLUMNS OF YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BE SOLVED BY A DISPENSARY OR PROMISE HAPPINESS. EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXAMPLES IN MY LETTER. ALLOWING SAFER LEGAL ACCESS IS NOT REQUIRED SPENDING ONE HUNDRED AND USED TO BILLBOARDS. THAT IS A BLATANT FALSEHOODS. WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO VOTE NAY ON A. B.

YES THANK YOU. THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY ALREADY FOLLOWS THE STRICTEST GUIDELINES. TO PREVENT YOUTH ACCESS TO CANNABIS. LEGAL CANNABIS THROAT SOLD THROUGH LICENSED RETAILERS IS AMONG THE MOST HIGHLY REGULATED CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. STATE LAW AND THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL- HAVE REGULATIONS PROHIBITING ADVERTISING IN A MANNER INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE PERSONS UNDER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE TO CONSUME CANNABIS OR CANNABIS PRODUCTS. ARE PROHIBITED A LICENSEE FROM PUBLISHING OR DISSEMINATING ADVERTISING OR MARKETING THIS TRACTOR CHILDREN- IT ALSO- PROHIBITS DEPICTIONS OF OR IMAGES OF MINORS OR ANYONE UNDER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE- AND IT PROHIBITS THE USE OF OBJECTS SUCH AS TOYS INFLATABLES MOVIE CHARACTERS. CARTOON CHARACTERS OR ANY OTHER DISPLAY DEPICTION OR IMAGE- DESIGNED IN ANY MANNER LIKELY TO BE APPEALING TO MINORS OR ANYONE UNDER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE. ACCORDING TO A MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE STUDY BY THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR HIGHWAY SAFETY- ALMOST ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. SAID THAT THE UNDER AGE USERS IN THEIR JURISDICTION GOT THEIR MARIJUANA FROM UNLICENSED SELLERS AND NEARLY A THIRD SAID THAT THE ILLICIT MARKET HAS GROWN- WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM HERE. WE HAVE A LEGAL INDUSTRY WHICH WILL NOT SELL TO PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY ONE AND IT ILLEGAL INDUSTRY WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER WE NEED THAT LEGAL INDUSTRY WHICH WILL NOT SELL TO YOUNGSTERS WE NEED THAT LEGAL INDUSTRY TO GROW THAT'S WHY I'M HERE THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING FOR A PROPER INTERPRETATION OF PROP SIXTY FOUR THANK YOU.

THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN FIFTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLEASE FEEL FREE 2% WHATEVER READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES AB FIFTEEN FIFTY TWO IS INTENDED TO EXTEND THE ACCREDITATION DEADLINE FOR DENTAL SCHOOLS FROM JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR. TWO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY THIRTY. THE REASON FOR THIS EXTENSION IS BECAUSE PURSUANT TO AB FIFTEEN NINETEEN PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THE GRADATION OF FOR DENTAL SCHOOLS WHICH IS USED TO BE PERFORMED BY THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL BOARD WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE COMMISSION OF DENTAL CREATION. OF THE EIGHTY A ALSO KNOWN AS CODA. THE LEGISLATION ALSO PROVIDED SCHOOLS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ACCREDITED BY THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL BOARD HAD TO BE COMPLETE. AT COMPLETED CODE ACCREDITATION PROCESS BY JAN FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. OTHERWISE THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR ACCREDITATION. NOW LET ME JUST SAY POINT OUT SOME OF THE ANALYSIS THAT I BELIEVE WE HAVE A POINT OF DIFFERENCE IN THAT IS THAT- THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT THERE IS. A TIME FRAME TO COMPLETE THE FORM SCHOOL ACCREDITATION THAT- ARE SPONSORS OF THE BILL HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AND THE OPINION IS BASED ON POINTTWO DOCUMENTATION. ARE BASED ON THE ACCREDITATION OF THE SAUDI ARABIAN SCHOOL THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. AND DID NOT ACHIEVE ITS ACCREDITATION UNTIL. ELEVEN YEARS LATER- DOCUMENTATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR ME TO SHARE WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF ALL WANTING TO SEE THAT SO BASED ON THAT- THERE'S A FEELING THAT THE NEED FOR AN EXTENSION- FOR THE SCHOOL. IS A VITALLY NECESSARY. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY TWO IS ABOUT PROVIDING A SCHOOL ADDITIONAL TIME FOR ACCREDITATION AND IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE ARE ACCURATE WHEN WE MAKE THESE CALCULATIONS. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT FOR ME AB FIFTEEN FIFTY TWO GOALS BEYOND PROVIDING A FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOL ADDITIONAL TIME FOR MEDITATION. THE GREATER POLICY ISSUES THE CHRONIC SHORTAGE AND MEL DISTRIBUTION OF DENTISTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CALIFORNIA HAS PUT A HANDFUL OF DENTAL SCHOOLS. HAS A HANDFUL OF THAT THE SCHOOLS ANOTHER THOUSANDS OF FLY ONLY A SELECT FEW ART ADMITTED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY. THE USC DENTAL SCHOOL HAD TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED APPLICANTS AND ONLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR WERE ADMITTED. THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO DENTAL SCHOOL HAD ONE THOUSAND A HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT APPLICANTS. AND ONLY EIGHTY WERE ADMITTED. SIMILARLY LOMA LINDA WHICH IS CLOSER TO OUR DISTRICT. I HAD ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN APPLICANTS AND ONLY A HUNDRED. OR ADMITTED THE STATISTICS PAINT A BLEAK PICTURE AS WE STRUGGLE TO REMEDY THE PERSISTENT PERVASIVE PROBLEM OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH DENTISTS IN CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE. AND PARTICULARLY IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONE THAT I REPRESENT. THIS BRINGS TO ME SECOND POINT THE MALICE PROVISION OF DENTISTS. THE SCHOOLS I MENTION ARE QUITE EXPENSIVE. AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR GRADUATING DENTISTS TO HAVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS. LOAN DEBT. IN LAWNDALE THIS HEAVY LOAN BURDEN CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO GRAVITATE TO PRACTICE IN AREAS WHERE THEY WILL MAXIMIZE OUR INCOME. DOES DO NOT EXPECT TOO MANY TO PRACTICE IN POOR COMMUNITIES. OUR RESEARCH ALL THE FOR EXAMPLE THAT IMPERIAL COUNTY MY DISTRICT THE RATIO OF DENTIST. TO POPULATION HAS ONE FOR EVERY FOUR THOUSAND. CONTRAST TO THIS RATIO IN MARIN COUNTY ONE TO EIGHT HUNDRED. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT ARE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB ELEVEN SIXTEEN TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM BY AUTHORIZING THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL BOARD. TO EVALUATE AND A QUALIFIED APPROVED FOR DENTAL SCHOOLS YEAH JEFF OBJECTIVE WAS TO CREATE ADDITIONAL. SOURCE OF DENTAL PROVIDERS. WHO WOULD HAVE TO PASS THE REQUIRED EXAMS AND WE'RE REQUIRED TO PRACTICE ONLY IN CALIFORNIA. THE RESULT OF THIS LEGISLATION WITH THE ACCREDITATION OF TWO FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOLS LA SALLE UNIVERSITY IN GONE ONE OF WATER IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR. AND THE MODEL WITH DENTAL SCHOOL IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THE SALAD UP TO ITS PURPOSE AND HIS GRADUATE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS. WHO HAVE PASSED REQUIRED EXAMS AND MANY ARE PRACTICING IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. EITHER ON THEIR OWN OR THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LIKE AUTOMATED LOCATED IN LOS ANGELES. WILL DOUBLE WILL GRADUATE ITS FIRST CLASS THIS YEAR AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT THEY WILL PASS THEIR EXAMS AND OF COURSE. PROVIDED DENTAL CARE TO CALIFORNIA'S AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. SO JUST LIKE LEGISLATORS BEFORE US HAD THE FORESIGHT TO CREATE THIS PROGRAM I FIRMLY BELIEVE. THAT IT IS OUR DUTY TO ENSURE THAT IT CONTINUES- THE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DEADLINE IS SIMPLY NOT ACHIEVABLE. AND WITHOUT AN EXTENSION MOBILE LOSE ITS GRADUATION AND CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY- UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WILL SUFFER AND THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN THIS CHAIR FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TO GIVE US AN EXTENSION TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AT THIS TIME AND THAT ARE HERE IN THE CHAMBERS- IN PERSON. AND WILL BEGIN THEN WITH- MISTER RICHARD POLANCO AND IF YOU COULD KINDLY LIMITER TESTIMONY TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHATEVER RIGHT MISER CHAIRMAN VICE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M RICHARD POLANCO FORMER MEMBER OF THIS DISTINGUISHED BODY I HAD THE HONOR.

AND ARE YOU CLEVELAND TO THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL SCHOOL SANDERS STANDARDS EXCUSE ME. THIS IS A MEASURE THAT IS VERY SIMPLE IT IS ASKING FOR AN EXTENSION. IT TAKES EIGHT TO TWELVE YEARS. TO IMPLEMENT AND MOVE FORWARD. TO COMPLETION UNDER THE CODE A PROCESS THE ANALYSIS IS INCORRECT WHEN IT SAYS THAT PRIOR TO. FIFTEEN ARE TWENTY FIFTEEN COATED DID NOT OFFER AN ACCREDITATION PROCESS FOR DENTAL SCHOOLS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. YOUR OFFICES WERE PROVIDED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. CALLED COTA SUPPLEMENTAL TO IT READS ON JANUARY ONE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL ACCREDITATION BEGAN TO ACCEPT ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS REFER TO AS THE P. A. C. V. SURVEYS. THOSE SURVEYS IN THAT PARTICULAR STRUCTURE IS ON PAGE FOUR. MEMBERS OF WHAT. IS SO DISTURBING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE IS THAT IF THIS WAS CORPORATE AMERICA ASKING FOR AN EXTENSION. IT WOULD BE GRANTED. THE ISSUE IN THE AND NOW MAY REFERENCE TO A FLYER. A FLYER THAT WAS POSTED AND A FLYER THAT WAS UTILIZED BY MODEL UNIVERSITY MOLDOVA USA A LICENSE CALIFORNIA- A COMPANY THAT PROVIDES. RECRUITMENT AND MARKETING SERVICES ALL THAT FLYER DID WAS REPLICATE THE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT EXIST THAT WERE SUBMITTED.

BUT THEY PUT A GREAT PICTURE PROSOPIS ONLINE LONGER THAN THAT HE TOOK THE UNIVERSITY OF SAUDI ARABIA THAT STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILL DEAL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO GET APPROVED THAT'S TWELVE YEARS.

HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL SO. PLEASE LEAVE YOUR COMMENTS TO MORE THAN MINUTES. GOOD MORNING THIS CHAIRMAN OF THE CAN. SAID CORP WITH THE K. DENTAL SO. REPRESENTING MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DENNIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSING AB FIFTEEN FIFTY TWO. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE DENTAL BOARD SUNSET REVIEW BILL AB FIFTEEN NINETEEN AUTHORED BY THE CHAIR. INCLUDED A PROVISION THAT SHIFTED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF APPROVING FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOLS FROM THE DENTAL BOARD TO THE COMMISSION ON DENTAL ACCREDITATION. THE LANGUAGE IN FIFTEEN NINETEEN WAS NOT ONLY A REFLECTION OF CONCERNS RAISED DURING PASSED ON THE BOARD SUNSET REVIEWS. BUT ALSO ILLUSTRATED A GROWING SHIFT A FOREIGN SCHOOL APPROVAL. IN SIMILAR FASHION THE MEDICAL BOARD'S TWENTY SEVENTEEN SUNSET BILL SHIFTED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO APPROVE INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL SCHOOLS TO OUTSIDE ENTITIES. CUTTERS APPROVAL PROCESS IS A WORKABLE PATHWAY TO ACCREDITATION USING THE DENTAL PROFESSIONS MOST UP TO DATE AND EVER EVOLVING STANDARDS. FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOL APPROVAL IS SOMETHING THAT THE DENTAL BOARD SIMPLY DOES NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DO CONFIDENTLY. BY SHIFTING THE APPROVAL PROCESS THE CODA BORN DENTAL SCHOOLS WILL BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS AT ALL DENTAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. CODE OVERSIGHT FOR FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOLS IS NOT ONLY MORE EFFICIENT BUT A SUPERIOR METHOD TO FULL BOARD APPROVAL. BECAUSE GRADUATES WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR LICENSURE IN ALL FIFTY STATES AND THEREFORE PRACTICE ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. FOR THESE REASONS CD RESPECTFULLY POSES AB FIFTEEN FIFTY TWO. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME.

THIS IS OPPOSITION OF AB FIFTEEN FIFTY TWO- AND WHAT CITY. LOOKS LIKE NOBODY IS RESPONDING TO THE ONLINE SO WE'LL JUST MOVE ON TO- NO MORE IN Q. IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEE NOAM ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN THE CHAMBERS OR IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM WHICH HAS BEGIN OPPOSITION AT THE TIME.WILL BRING THE CONVERSATION BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS WE CAN WITH A SIMILAR CHEN FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. OF THANK YOU RESEARCHER APPRECIATE- THE INTELLIGENCE. NO AS A STANDARD MEDINA RESEARCH ON THE BILL. THE BILL CHANGE THE PREVIOUS AGREED UPON TIMELINE AND HOPES TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL ACCREDITATION PROCESS. HELPS PROVIDE FOR DENTAL SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH MORE GRADUATION OPPORTUNITIES. AND EVERY TIME I TALK TO CDA WHEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DISCUSS. IS TO MAKE SURE THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. AND WHICH STUDENTS CAN GOING TO THE DENTAL INDUSTRY. YET I SEE. THIS IS INTENT OF THE BILL BUT THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION IS IN OPPOSITION OF THIS. THAT MAKES ME THINK. THAT PERHAPS THE INTENT THE RESULTS OF THE BILL COULD BE DIFFERENT. SO MY QUESTION. TO THE AUTHOR IT. IS WHY DO YOU THINK. THE CDA IN OPPOSITION AND HAVE YOU TRIED TO WORK WITH THE CDA. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO. COME TO A AGREEMENT. IT SO MUCH HERE. SO TOUCH ON IT AND ALL ASK ONE OF THE WITH TO ALLOW BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATIONS WITH- SEVERAL NEW BOARD MEMBERS- OF THE CD EIGHT OR I'M SORRY OF THE- DENTAL BOARD ASSOCIATION WHO HAS SHED LIGHT ON. SOME OF THE DIFFERENCE HERE I HEARD THE OPPOSITION LOUD AND CLEAR AND I DON'T THINK WE DISAGREE WITH. THE STANDARD THAT'S BEEN SET BY UTILIZING THE QUOTA PROCESS IN FACT THAT WE'RE SAYING THAT WE ARE ADHERING TO THAT PROCESS GIVEN THE HIGHER STANDARDS THAT ARE BEING SET. AS IT RELATES TO THE DENTAL ASSOCIATION I'D LIKE FOR- MIGHT. EITHER ONE OF THE TWO WITNESSES TO KIND OF ELABORATE ON THAT I'VE NOT HAD ANY DIRECT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CDA SPECIFICALLY TO THIS BUT I THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL INTENT ON TRYING TO EXPAND- THE DENTAL- PROFESSIONAL. AREA TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL- THAT WE ALL HAVE- SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS BILL AND THE APPEAL THAT THE SCHOOLS HAVE FOR STUDENTS. TO ATTEND AND ULTIMATELY COME BACK TO CALIFORNIANS ARE BUT A MASSIVE CLASS OF ONE OF THE TWO WITNESSES CAN OPERATE ON DELUDE DENTAL SOLICITATION. LAST SUMMER CHEN TO WHICH. THE PRIMARY WITNESS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. MR LOW APPS DON'T BE GREAT OF RELIEF FOR- DURING. OKAY M. POLANCO DO WISH TO HAVE THE QUESTION REPEATED OR GPS WOULD YOU PLEASE RESTATE THE QUESTION. ABSOLUTELY THIS BLOG I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME SO AS I SAID THE INTENT IS TO HAVE A MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FORMED- THE GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE DENTAL INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE IN INDUSTRY AND ONE OF THE MAIN. TENANTS OF THE CD AS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A PIPELINE FOR STUDENTS TO COME INTO THE DENTAL INDUSTRY AND I SEE THAT IS THE INTENT OF THE BILL YET THE CDA IS IN OPPOSITION OF THIS SO IT SEEMS THE INTENT OF THE BILL THE RESULTS OF. WHAT WE WANT COULD BE- FROM OPPOSITE IDEOLOGIES SO IF YOU CAN EXPAND ON THAT WHY DO YOU THINK CD'S OPPOSITION AND I'M ALSO ASKING HAVE THEIR DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND THE CDA. AND I ALSO HUMBLY ASK THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL- SINCE HE HAS NOT YET SPOKEN TO THE CDA TO SOUNDS LIKE TO IF THERE IS- WITH THE IN DOLCE- IN TERMS OF FUTURE DISCUSSIONS. TO DISCUSS WITH. CDA SINCE THE IMPACT THEM THE MOST. YES UP. SEVERAL QUESTIONS THERE FIRST ARC WE BEEN IN. WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL BOARD. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL BOARD HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION. ON THE BILL. UP WE'VE HAD CONVERSATION WITH. AND I'M ASSUMING BASED ON THE ANALYSIS THAT- THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS ARE IN CONVERSATION. AND AS A RESULT YOU HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IN THE ANALYSIS. WITH REGARDS TO THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION AS I MENTIONED. THEY WERE THE SPONSORS ORIGINALLY. OF A BILL THAT WAS GOING TO ADDRESS. THE NEED TO HAVE MORE DENTISTS WE HAVE SIX DENTAL SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. IF EACH ONE IS GRADUATING EVERY YEAR ONLY A HUNDRED. RIGHT THAT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER WE ARE BEYOND WANTING TO CHANGE THE POLICY THE POLICY WAS CHANGED LAST YEAR. ON THE INSISTENCE OF THE OMNIBUS BILL OF THIS COMMITTEE WHICH WAS. NO LONGER CALIFORNIA DENTAL BOARD WILL YOU BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCREDITING. FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOLS WE ARE HERE TODAY TO SAY WE NEED. A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. TO DO THE ACCREDITATION WE I GRADUATED OVER TWO HUNDRED FROM MEXICO WHO ARE PRACTICING IN MANY COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE PASSED THE TEST SO IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF COMPETENCY IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF NOT HAVING AN EQUIVALENT STANDARD. WE HAVE BEFORE YOU A NEED TO EXTEND THE TIME TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. AND I WANT TO JUST COMMIT TO THE- MEMBER LAST A QUESTION THAT WE WILL DIRECTLY SIT DOWN. WITH THE DENTAL ASSOCIATION AND SEE EXACTLY WHERE- THE DIFFERENCES ARE WHAT I HEARD HERE IN THEIR OPPOSITION AS THE- ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS A DESIRE BY FOREIGN SCHOOLS TO NOT. COMPLY BY THE CODE A PROCESS AND THAT IS NOT THE CASE WE'RE NOT ARGUING OR DEBATING THAT POLICY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE NEED MORE TIME BECAUSE THE COURT PROCESS IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT LONGER THAN THE DENTAL BOARD PROCESS TECH. AND THE EXAMPLE IS THE SAUDI ARABIA SCHOOL- THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF PERSPECTIVE BASED ON ANALYSIS RIGHT UP THAT IT TOOK FAR LONGER THAN WHAT THE ANALYSIS I. MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I MAY ADD ONE MORE. TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE NEED. IN THE LETTER THAT YOU RECEIVED FROM THE DENTAL ASSOCIATION. AND THE TESTIMONY YOU HEARD. EVERY GRADUATE. FROM A FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOL THAT GETS A CREDIT FROM THE ACCREDITED IF THEY COME FROM CALIFORNIA THEY CAN PRACTICE ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE BILL. THAT KEELEY HAD REQUIRED EVERY STUDENT FROM CALIFORNIA WHO WENT TO EITHER. MOLDOVA OR MEXICO UPON GRADUATION THEY CAN ONLY PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA THAT LICENSE IS IT AND WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE 2225% OF CALIFORNIA DENTAL SCHOOL GRADUATES WHO GET LICENSED. LEAVE CALIFORNIA TO PRACTICE. SO THE GAP. TO CLOSING THE SHORTAGE OF DENTISTS IN LOW INCOME RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY DO NOT EXIST. IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE. ALL WE ARE ASKING IS GIVE US MORE TIME TO COMPLETE THE CODE A PROCESS. NEXT YEAR THE FIRST SEVEN STUDENTS CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WILL GRADUATE FROM MOLDOVA. WE HAVE ALREADY GRADUATED OVER TWO HUNDRED FROM MEXICO. AGAIN IT'S THE TIME ISSUE MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE ANSWERS AND I HAVE NOTHING BUT THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL- HIS POLICY HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING IN WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE IN TERMS OF RESEARCH. IN PARTICULAR FOR THIS PARTICULAR CALL YOU STATED MORE TIME AND I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT BASED ON WHAT I'VE STUDIED AND BASED ON WHAT I'VE LOOKED AT THE MORE TIME WICKS TO EIGHT. TO TEN YEARS EIGHT TO TEN YEARS FOR THIS PROCESS TO TAKE COMPLAINTS FROM START TO FINISH. BASED ON WHAT I'VE SEEN THE DATA EIGHT TO TEN YEARS SEEMS QUITE LONG FOR WHAT NEEDS O BE ACCOMPLISHED SO. THAT IS MY CONCERN THAT EIGHT TO TEN YEARS OR SOMETHING WHICH WE HOPE TO SEE STUDENTS GOING TO WITH THE DENTAL INDUSTRY AT A FASTER EXPEDITIOUS PACE ADDED TWO YEARS FOR ME PERSONALLY THIS IS A BIT TOO LONG I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR AND THE TESTIMONY- BUT BASED ON. THOSE THINGS I'VE SEEN I UNFORTUNATELY CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL AT THIS TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR REFRESH YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A MERCHANT WILL GO ON INTO ASSEMBLY. MEMBER MEDINA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. NO I TO- CD INTENT OF THE BILL. AND CERTAINLY- I'M HAPPY TO SEE- MORE DENNIS- THAT ARE NEEDED. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. TO THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT. JUST TO TRY TO CLARIFY. WHAT THE SITUATION. IS THAT NOW EXIST IF I MIGHT. SO TO THE WITNESS MR POLANCO- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES HERE RIGHT THE NEW JERSEY THAT THEY LAST SATURDAY AND MOLDOVA- ONE OF THEM IS ALREADY ACCREDITED. IS THAT YES ONE ONE WAS A CREDIT ONE IS ACCREDITED BY THE CALIFORNIA LET ME STATE THIS WITH. TO HAVE BEEN ACCREDITED BY THE DENTAL BOARD ONE IN MEXICO ONE IN MOTHER OVER. THE. DENTAL SCHOOL IN MEXICO APPLIED FOR THE QUOTA PROCESS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THEY WERE DENIED THERE'S A LETTER TO THAT EFFECT. AND SO YOUR YOUR QUESTION IS THERE'S REALLY AT THIS POINT IN TIME OF THE- MOLDOVA IS THE UNIVERSITY IS THE DENTAL SCHOOL THAT IS STILL UNDER THE- CALIFORNIA DENTAL BOARD OF JURISDICTION UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND THEN IT TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IT WOULD COME UNDER THE CODE OF THAT THAT BY THEN IT WAS COME UNDER QUOTA AND UNDER THE KOTA GUIDELINES AND THEIR OWN TIME TABLE MEMBERS IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. AND IF THE INTENT IS TO DO AWAY WITH WITH. THE ACCREDITATION OF THIS PARTICULAR- CAN THE DE. SCHOOL THE NEW BE FRONT ABOUT IT AND JUST THAT BUT IF IT NOT. THEN IT IS MOVE THE BILL. THIS IS WORK TO SEE IF THEY CAN BE BETTER THEN WE A COMMON AND ASSURE. THAT THE OP. FOR A- QUALIFIED EDUCATION. IN DENTISTRY. CAN BE CAN CONTINUE TO BE OFFERED. AND DO I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS IS TAKING UP TO I WROTE DOWN ELEVEN YEARS. THE ANSWER IS CORRECT YES AND THE INITIAL PROCESS IN COURT IT STARTED. PURSUANT TO THEIR OWN REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN. IT WAS NOT UNTIL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT THE FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOL IN SAUDI ARABIA. WAS APPROVED. AND THE- SCHOOL IN MEXICO WHO ALSO APPLIED IN THE PROCESS PURSUANT TO THAT REPORT THAT YOUR STAFF HAVE. AND THEY WERE DENIED. BUT LATER PROVED THE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT STATUS IS THE COULD HAVE APPEALED IT. WE'RE NOT SURE WE KNOW THAT THEY HAD SENT A LETTER- OF WHICH- I BELIEVE THIS YOUR STAFF SHOULD HAVE AND BASICALLY FROM THEIR ATTORNEY- QUOTA. MARC SUMMERS A LAW FIRM INDICATING THAT THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT AFTER ALL THIS TIME AND RESOURCES THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ACCREDITED. AND WHAT UNIVERSITY ARE YOU REFERRING TO. THEY LESS AREA IN ONE ABOUT THE MEDICAL. A. N. N. N. HOW WHAT WOULD YOU TELL ME WHAT WHY IS THE REASON FOR SUCH A LONG PROCESS IN OUR TRADITION HERE OF COLLEGES IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE SCHOOLS YOU KNOW IS DONE RATHER QUICKLY SO WHY AND WHY IN THIS PROCESS DOES IT TAKE SO LONG. THAT WAS A VERY FUNDAMENTAL POLICY QUESTION IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE SCHOOL THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. THAT THE COURT HAS APPROVED FOR DENTAL SCHOOL. OF YOUR QUESTION IS A QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- MEDINA- THAT IS- IT'S LIKE WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG. THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL BOARD THAT ESTABLISHED THE REGULATIONS- DIDN'T TAKE ELEVEN YEARS. AND THOSE STANDARDS AS THE LETTER FROM THE- DENTAL ASSOCIATION- THE DENTAL BOARD WAS IN COMMUNICATION AND CO TO STANDARDS- WE MAKE SURE THAT THE EDUCATION STANDARDS ALL SEVEN OF THEM COMPETENCY. FACILITIES. ADMISSIONS ALL. SEVEN FOUR TO FIVE. INCH BINDERS WITH INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DATA NOW THIS IS ALL DONE AT NO EXPENSE. TO THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. THE APPLICANT. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS. IT SHOULD NOT TAKE ELEVEN YEARS IT BEGS THE QUESTION. THEN WHY. WHEN WE KNOW WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF DENTISTS. YEAH I. VERY MUCH UNDERSTAND THAT- CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO PROBABLY HAVE GOTTEN TURNED DOWN FROM SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY- WITHIN CALIFORNIA IF THEY'RE LIMITED OF WANTING TO GO ESPECIALLY TO ACCREDITED SCHOOLS OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY- I MYSELF SIDE AMERICAN STUDENTS GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN SPAIN WHEN THEY WERE TURNED AWAY FROM MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN UNITED STATES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. C. NONE AS A MEMBER PRESS IF YOU WISH TO CLOSE. I DO THINK YOU SO MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR FOR. LÏNG JUST SAID DELIBERATION DEBATE. TO TAKE PLACE BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE SHED LIGHT ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ISSUES- REGARDING- THE SHORTAGES. THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR PROFESSIONAL DENTISTS- THE ONE IS THE PROCESS. THAT TAKES SUCH A LONG TIME WITH CODA- AND THE SHIFT THAT WE MADE. THE TO THE DENTAL BOARD- DESIRE TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. THE RECOMMENDATIONS MAKE AND POLICY THAT WAS APPROVED. RECENTLY BUT THE QUESTION ALSO. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. FOREIGN SCHOOLS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO STAY. IN PLACE. TO PROVIDE THOSE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AT LOWER COST. WITH THE CONDITIONS OF THEM COMING BACK TO SERVE IN. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES I JUST WANT TO REITERATE. YOU KNOW THOSE NUMBERS IMPERIAL COUNTY RACIAL DENTIST POPULATION ONE. EVERY FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED. IN CONTRAST TO THE RACIAL. OF DENTISTS IN MARIN COUNTY. WHICH IS ONE- AND EVERY HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO- MEMBERS OF THEIR POPULATIONS WE HAVE A- SERIOUS- DISPARITIES THAT EXIST. IN SOME ARE MORE POOR COMMUNITIES AND SOME OR ALL ARE MORE AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES. AND SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING HERE IS AN EXTENSION OF TIME. AND PERHAPS. TWENTY THIRTY SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME IS ONE OF THE COLLEAGUES AS MENTIONED BUT THAT'S BASED ON THE RESEARCH IT'S DONE. THAT IT WILL TAKE ORDER TO APPROVE THIS PROCESS- IF THERE IS A DIFFERENT DATE. THAT OTHER MEMBERS WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SCHOOL TO PROCEED. AND MEET SOME OF THE BENCHMARKS AS ONE OF THE WITNESSES AS JUST ARTICULATED. WOULD BE HAPPY AND OPEN TO CONSIDERING THAT AND WE WILL MEET DIRECTLY AS I'VE BEEN TOLD- OUR TEAM AND THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL HAD MET WITH THE- DENTAL ASSOCIATION TO GET AT THE CORE OF THEIR OPPOSITION WHICH WHAT I HEARD WAS. OF THEIR ADAMANT ABOUT THE CODA PROCESS AND WE DON'T DISAGREE. AT WE'RE JUST SAYING WE NEED A BIT MORE TIME TO MEET THAT STANDARD OR THAT EXPECTATION OF. TIME FRAME WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK- FOR YOUR VOTE. AND- YOUR COULD. MISTER CHAIR FOR A- REASONABLE- AND MODEST THAT EXTENSION THAT WOULD HELP THE STUDENTS CONTINUE WITH THEIR EDUCATION COMPACT CALIFORNIA AND SERVE THE UNDERSERVED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SUMMER GARCIA APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD TO BOTH IN THIS COMMITTEE AND ALSO IN PERSON. AS I MENTIONED TO YOU OVER THE PHONE THAT UNFORTUNATELY BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE BEEN SOLD A BILL OF GOODS AND AS YOU KNOW THIS WAS BROUGHT FORTH TO OUR COMMITTEE ON THE DENTAL. BOARD'S SUNSET HEARING OF IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS AND WE'VE HAD ROBUST CONVERSATIONS WE ALSO HEARD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE DISAGREEMENTS ON THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS HOW WE TAKE. OUR PRIDE IN OUR WORK AND THE STAFF SPEAKS FOR THE COMMITTEE CHAIR. HIMSELF AND SO WITH THE DILIGENCE AND THE HARD WORK PUT IN THIS EFFORT WE SEE POLICY DISAGREEMENT AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME WHICH IS WHY IT UNFORTUNATELY. HAS A NO RECOMMENDATION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE BUT I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AS WE CONTINUE TO HELP ADDRESS MANY OF THESE ISSUES MOVING FORWARD SO WITH THAT- IS THERE A MOTION. K. THAT IS OUR SECOND. SINGLE SECOND AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SUMMER GARCIA. THAT WILL LEAVE THE- WILL OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS AS WE CONTINUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. WELL NOW THEN MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN THIS IS BY A SUMMER FONG THIS IS AB FOURTEEN NINETY FOUR I SUMMER FONG THIS DOES ENJOY TO PASS RECOGNITION ON BOTH SIDES THE OP. THE BILL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBERS I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY. AB FORTY NINETY FOUR WILL ALLOW REGISTERED NURSE WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF BLOOD COLLECTION AT A MOBILE BLOOD BANK TO BE AVAILABLE BY VIDEO TELECONFERENCE BLOOD DONATIONS STATE COUNTLESS LIVES ACROSS THE STATE AND NATION AND ACCORDING TO THE BLOOD CENTERS OF CALIFORNIA SOMEONE NEEDS A BLOOD TRANSFUSION EVERY THREE SECONDS. DONATED BLOOD PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT INJURIES AND DISEASES RANGING FROM CANCER HEART DISEASE ORGAN TRANSPLANTS TO SEVERE DRAMATIC INJURIES IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT WE RELY ON KINDNESS AND GENEROSITY OF BLOOD DONORS TO HELP SAVE SICK INFORMAL CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY THE CARBON NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE BLOOD COLLECTIONS SCARCER BUT CURRENT REGULATIONS ALLOW FOR DEVIATIONS FROM STAFFING REQUIREMENTS IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY LAST APRIL GOVERNOR NEWSOM EVEN ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ENCOURAGING HEALTHCARE FACILITIES TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE PRACTICES YOU'RE BOUND TO BE SUCCESSFUL DURING THE PANDEMIC. BLOOD DONATIONS HAVE BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY AS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR KOBE CAN DONATE BLOOD WITH THEIR ANTIBODIES TO HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY SECOND EVEN HELP TO CONTINUE THE STUDY THE VIRUS. AT THE END THE DAY THIS BILL IS ABOUT EXPANDING ACCESS TO NEEDED BLOOD SUPPLIES FOR FLEXIBILITY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS ARE STILL COLLECTED SAFELY AND RESPONSIBLY EITHER WITH A NURSE ON SITE WERE AVAILABLE VIA VIDEO TELECONFERENCING AND I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THAT I UNDERSTAND OPPOSITION CONCERNS FOR PATIENTS AND HEALTH AND THAT IS WHY WE'VE BEEN VERY ACCOMMODATING BY ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE- MOBILE BLOOD DONATIONS ARE CONDUCTED WITH APPROPRIATE SAFETY MEASURES. I JUST BASICALLY I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THINK THE STAFF BUT IT SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT WE HAVE THE SPECIFIED TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR BLOOD DONOR- BLOOD OF LOBOTOMIZED REQUIRED MOBILE BLOOD DONATIONS TO BE HELD IN AREAS RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTION. REQUIRED BLOOD BANKS REPORT IS THE P. EIGHT ON ALL DONOR ADVERSE RISK EVENTS AND REQUIRES THE PH TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON DONOR ADVERSE EVENTS AT THE END OF THE SUNSET PERIOD AND THIS BILL WOULD OF COURSE IMPLEMENT A SENSE THAT PERIOD. AFTER FIVE YEARS SO WE ARE CERTAINLY WE WERE WITH THE OPPOSITE BUT WE SUPPOSED TO KNOWLEDGE- THERE CONCERN AND WE WANT. TO HAVE OF BLOOD COLLECTION DONE AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE NUMBER DOING TODAY BY SEAN MCNALLY THE PRESIDENCY OF. THAT HOUSING COMMITTEE PUBLIC. ANOTHER LORI KAMMER ADVOCATE FOR HOUSING COMMITTEE POPPING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THE OPERATOR COMING OPEN UP THE LINES FOR THE PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT PLEASE LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES. AB YEAH GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WELCOME. OKAY GOOD MORNING PART OF THE CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY PERSONALY. AND I'VE VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU TO SEVEN OF THE FALL MY NAME IS SEAN MCNALLY I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO HOW CAN COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK IN BAKER SHOW CALIFORNIA AND I'M TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. BLOOD BANKS AND BLOOD COLLECTION PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN SAVING LIVES PARTICULARLY IN THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WITH THE CODE NINETEEN ANOTHER PANDEMIC IMPACTS. AS WELL AS POTENTIAL WILDFIRE EMERGENCIES. HOSPITALS AND CARE GIVERS MUST HAVE THE NECESSARY PUT SUPPLY. OUR POLICY ADOPTION IS TO MAINTAIN NURSES ON SITE AT ALL TIMES THAT ARE PERMANENT LOCATIONS WITH SELLING SODA MOBILE SITES CUT SIGNIFICANTLY INTO OUR ABILITY TO MAXIMIZE BLOOD COLLECTION AND THAT IS THAT'S JUST THE SIMPLE FACT. WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO CONDUCT OUR MOBILE SITE COLLECTIONS WITH NURSES WHO ARE NOT PRESENT AT THE MOBILE SITE BUT WHO ARE ALWAYS. IN CONSTANT ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. WE CAN MAXIMIZE OUR BLOOD COLLECTION AND WE CAN DO THIS WHILE PROVIDING FULL FULLY FOR THE SAFETY OF THOSE WHO DONATE BLOOD AT THE SITES. WE MAINTAIN CPR TRAINED AND CERTIFIED STAFF. TO ADMINISTER RESUSCITATION AND OTHER GENERAL FIRST AID AT ALL SITES. BLOOD DONATION FACT ARE NOT MEDICAL OFFICES WITH MEDICAL EQUIPMENT OTHER THAN WHAT IS USED TO COLLECT BLOOD. AND THE FACT IS THAT CPR GENERAL FOR STATE COST TO DO THE FULL EXTENT OF MEDICAL INTERVENTION POSSIBLE. WHEN AWAITING A RESPONSE TO A NINE ONE ONE CALL ME THAT OF THE BLOOD DONOR APPEARS. TO HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY. BUT EVENTS GIVING RISE TO NINE ONE ONE CALLS ARE EXTREMELY RARE BLOOD DONATION SITES. IN FACT THE RISK OF A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT WHILE DRIVING TO WORK FROM A BLOOD DONATION SITE IS GREATER THAN THE RISK OF A MEDICAL EMERGENCY ARISING. FROM A BLOOD DONATION. THAT'S THE GOVERNOR ISSUES EXECUTIVE ORDER ALLOWING BLOOD DONATION WITHOUT THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF A NURSE THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERIOUS INCIDENTS STATEWIDE. AND THE PROCESS HAS WORKED VERY WELL. IN FACT YEAR HOW SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE OUR BLOOD COLLECTION COMMITMENT TO THE PANDEMIC WITH SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES SHUT DOWN. ALL WE'RE ASKING IS TO KEEP DOING WHAT WE HAVE THAT THE REALLY SUCCESSFUL WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE. WE ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SIMPLY SIGNIFYING THEIR SUPPORT. THANK YOU IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN NINETY FOUR YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ONE AND THEN ZERO YOU AREN'T SUPPORT.

ONLY VERY MUCH APPRECIATED OPPONENTS WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH UP TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. A CONCERN THE PATIENT HAVE COULD BE RISKS BY THE CHANGE. ONE CONCERN INCLUDES RESPECT ME EXACERBATED IN RURAL AREAS WITH BUT LACKS RELIABLE INTERNET OR PHONE SERVICE. BUT LIKELY LONGER TRAVEL TIME TO RECEIVE CARE IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED THE BOTH THE FLAG HE INTERNET AND TRAP CALLED DURING TELECONFERENCING EVEN IN URBAN AREAS. NEVER MIND A LACK OF ACCESS TO RURAL AREAS AND IN THIS SITUATION EXCEPT NEW TRUTHS CAN BE EXTREMELY HARMFUL. MEETING WITH PROPONENTS THEY NEVER ARTICULATED NOR DEMONSTRATED AND NEED FOR REMOVING OUR CERVANTES. ONLY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EFFICIENCY WHICH IS VERY CONCERNING TO US. WHILE THE REST OF TRUCK WHAT JOHN BLOOD OR NOT IF THE BEER AT THE OTHER FORMS OF HEALTH CARE THERE VERY WELL. THIS BILL WOULD RELY ON THE BOTTOM IS WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE TRAINING AND KNOWLEDGE THAT EARNERS HAD. IDENTIFIED AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NEED FOR CARE AND WOULD INCREASE THE ODDS THAT SUCH THREATS COULD HAPPEN IF AGAIN AFTER HEALTH EVENT. TWENTY THREE MINS WE ASK FOR YOUR NOBEL.

AND I APPLAUD THE WORK OF BLOOD BANKS ACROSS THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO ADJUST THIS BILL WILL PROMOTE. INCREASED ACCESS THE BLOOD BANK SERVICES STATEWIDE AND RURAL AREAS AND IT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- IN PARTICULAR I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS FOR PATIENTS HEALTH AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN AGAIN VERY ACCOMMODATING BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE BLOOD MOBILE DONATIONS. ARE CONDUCTED WITH APPROPRIATE SAFETY MEASURES HOWEVER THERE ARE ALSO MANY PATIENTS THAT ARE HOSPITALS THAT ARE IN URGENT NEED OF BLOOD FOR TRANSFUSIONS AND TREATMENTS AND THAT'S A NATIONAL SHORTAGE OF DONATED BLOOD. WE ALL KNOW- INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY IF AND IF SOMEONE GETS IN A CAR WRECK A NEEDS A BLOOD TRANSFUSION- THOSE BLOOD SUPPLIES ARE VITAL AND WE NEED TO BE EXPANDING ACCESS. THROUGHOUT THE CITY CALIFORNIA FOR THESE NEW PRODUCTS AND SO WHAT WE'RE DRAW WHAT WE DRAW CLOSER AT THROUGHOUT THE ENDING AT THIS BY. WE NEED TO BE A PREPARED TO BLOOD PART READY TO ANY.

MR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TWO NINE THE BILL THAT PROHIBITS A PERSON REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED AS A SECURITY GUARD FROM CARRYING OR USING A FIRE ARM A BATON UNLESS SECURITY GUARD. THE SECURITY GUARD IS AN EMPLOYEE OF A PRIVATE PATROL OPERATOR LYSONS LICENSEE OR AN EMPLOYEE OF THE STATE. MEMBERS AS THE COUNTRY WHAT'S THE TRIAL OF THEIR CHILDREN THE EX POLICE OFFICER CHARGED WITH KILLING. OF GEORGE FLOOR THERE WAS A SIMULTANEOUS DISCUSSION REGARDING LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE TRAINING. OF THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE. THE CONVICTION OF THEIR CHILDREN WAS THE FIRST UP IN SECURING JUSTICE FOR GEORGE PLOY. NOW THE NATION'S SETS ITS SIGHTS ON THE OTHER THREE OFFICERS THAT FAILED TO INTERVENE AND ULTIMATELY WATCHES WATCHES GEORGE FOR ITS FINAL MOMENTS. ON EARTH EXPIRED. BUT TODAY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. AND BRING AWARENESS TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT CARRY FIREARMS BATONS. THEY ARE EMPLOYED TO KEEP OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND PROPERTY SAFE AS WELL AS THE FINANCIAL DEALINGS OF BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY ARE HARD TO KEEP THE PEACE AT SPORTING EVENTS AND CONCERTS. THEY ARE OUR PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS. WHILE PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS DIFFER FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT A NUMBER OF AREAS I WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY OFTEN FACE SIMILAR SITUATIONS. EVEN TRAGIC ONES. MEMBERS MARIO MATTHEWS WAS A MEXICAN AMERICAN WHO WORKED AS A WAREHOUSE WORKER. ACCORDING TO A LAWSUIT FILED BY HIS PARENTS ON JULY SECOND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AROUND THREE THIRTY AM AFTER ATTENDING AN OUTDOOR CONCERT FOLLOWING TWO NBA EXHIBITION GAMES. MARIO ENTERED THE GOLDEN ONE CENTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THROUGH A PROPPED OPEN DOOR WHICH WAS PART OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE- SURVEILLANCE SHOWED MARIO RUNNING AROUND THE COURT AND DRIBBLING AS IF HE WAS PLAYING BASKETBALL. THEN TO UNIVERSAL PROTECTION SECURITY PERSONNEL BEGAN CHASING MARIO AND EVENTUALLY DETAINED HIM. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES THAT MARIO WAS TACKLED DOWN N THE FLOOR. HIS HANDS WERE HANDCUFFED BEHIND HIS BACK AND THE TWO SECURITY PERSONNEL GOTON TOP OF HIS BACK. ONE OF THE SECURITY GUARDS USES RIGHT NEED TO APPLY PRESSURE TO THE SIDE AND MARIO SNACK FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES. IN ADDITION TO THE INITIAL TO UNIVERSAL PROTECTION SECURITY PERSONNEL. A THIRD SECURITY OFFICER PLACED HIMSELF ON MARIO'S BACK. MEMBERS THIS SOUND FAMILIAR. MARIO BECAME UNRESPONSIVE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL HE PASSED AWAY TWO DAYS LATER. THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS THAT THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY CORONER KNOWLEDGE THAT RESTRAINTS WAS THE CAUSE OF MORROW'S DEATH. ADDITIONALLY THE CORONER'S PATHOLOGIST NOTED DEEP BRUISING ON MORROW'S BACK AS A RESULT OF THE WEIGHT AND PRESSURE THAT HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIM. MARIO WEIGHED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POUNDS. WELL THE NATION DEBATES LAW ENFORCEMENT'S TRAINING ON THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS CURRENTLY HAVE NO TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR COURSES ON THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE. AB TWO TWENTY NINE. WOULD ADD THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE TO THE TRAINING COURSES WITHIN THE PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICES ACT INCLUDING TRAINING ON THE USE OF OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE FORCE. DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BIAS AND CULTURAL TRAINING. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE COURSE IN THE CARRYING AND USE OF FIREARMS TO INCLUDE TRAINING IN THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THIS LEGISLATION COULD HELP SAVE OTHERS I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THE BUREAU OF SECURITY AND INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES FOR THEIR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH THIS BILL. THOSE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OR STUART KATZ AN ATTORNEY FOR THE FAMILY OF MORAL MATTHEWS AND DAVID CHANDLER PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LICENSE SECURITY AGENCIES GUARDS AND ASSOCIATES.

THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME MISTER CAT FAMILY ATTORNEY ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING THE MATTHEWS FAMILY. I THINK THIS LEGISLATION IS A VALUABLE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER. THAT THERE ACTUALLY MORE SECURITY CARDS IN CALIFORNIA. THEN THERE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT OF INTERACTION BETWEEN. SECURITY GUARDS IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND WOULD FREQUENTLY HAPPENS WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT GOT INVOLVED THE SITUATIONS. B. UNFORTUNATELY. OF THE- MISS. SITUATE BY THE C. GUARDS TENDS TO AFFECT AN ADVERSE. THE ACTIONS OF THE U. LATER RESPONDING OFFICER- I THINK PEOPLE HIGHER SECURITY HAVE EXPECT THAT THEY DO HAVE THIS TRAINING AND I SUSPECT THAT IF YOU WERE TO ASK PEOPLE WHO ARE HIRING SECURITY GUARDS AND COMPANIES PROVIDING SECURITY GUARDS- THEY WOULD BE UP SHE IF THEY REALIZE THAT THIS LACK OF TRAINING. I THINK THIS. ASSEMBLY BILL IS A- THE STRONG STEP IN THE RIGHT TO. AND CAN ONLY HELP POTS- OUR FOR THE PUBLIC IS WHOLE IS AS THOSE WHO POINT SECURITY.

SO I WANT TO THANK THE START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON MAKING THIS A BILL BETTER. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR THE LEGISLATURE HAS GONE OUT OF ITS WAY TO ASSIST THE LEGAL RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA INDUSTRY WE'VE LOWERED THE TAXES ON RECREATIONAL CANNABIS WE'VE REDUCE THE REGULATORY BURDEN. AND THIS YEAR WE WILL BE ASKED YET AGAIN TO ASSIST WITH LICENSURE AND I WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE LEGAL MARKET BUT I DO NOT THINK WE NEED TO DO IT AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR CHILDREN. AND THAT'S WHAT AB TWO SEVENTY THREE IS ABOUT THIS BILL LIMITS THE CONTENT THAT MARIJUANA LICENSEES CAN PLACE ON BILLBOARD'S. OPPONENTS OF PROP SIXTY FOUR SOLD THEIR INITIATIVE TO VOTERS WITH THE PROMISE THAT THE LEGAL INDUSTRY WOULD NOT TARGET OR ADVERTISED TO CHILDREN. FIVE YEARS LATER THE BILLBOARD ADVERTISING MARIJUANA. INFUSED GUMMIES AND HARD CANDIES WITH SHOPS NAMED COOKIES COUNTING FLAVORS LIKE LEMONADE. AND WITH SOME ADVERTISEMENTS MIMICKING THE LOGO OF SHOWS FEATURED ON DISNEY. IT'S EASY TO SEE THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS BROKEN THEIR PROMISE AND IT'S TIME TO PERFORM THE LOS. AB TWO SEVENTY THREE PLACES REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT CAN BE ADVERTISED ON MARIJUANA BILLBOARD SIMILAR TO RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON MEMBERS OF THE UN AND I WILL ALSO ADD. THAT WE HAVE TRIED TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY IS- IF THEY HAVE SOME ISSUES ABOUT THE LIST OF ITEMS THAT OF. THAT WE ARE- MAKE INSURANCE USE BUT WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS UP UNTIL THIS POINT SO- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO BE A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SEVENTY THREE.

IF- IF THE PEOPLE WITHOUT IS ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS AND WE BELIEVE THE SAME TO BE TRUE FOR CANNABIS AND ALL OTHER DIRECTIONS INCLUDING GAMBLING.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEN ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN THE CHAMBERS WHICH IS BEACON OPPOSITION OR IN THE COMMITTEE OOMS WHEN THEY BRING THE CONVERSATION BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM CAN MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. THIS BOOK. THERE'S BEEN A MOTION BY MISTER BERMAN SAID BY MR MCCARTY QUESTION FROM A SIMILAR BLUE. YEAH I FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE WHERE I AM ON THIS BILL- BUT- ONE THING GOD THAT THE AUTHORS AT NIGHT. WONDERING IF YOU COULD- ARTICULATE A LITTLE BIT TO. A FURTHER ON ON. TOPIC IT'S DISTURBING TO ME THAT. APPARENTLY THERE BEEN NO CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND- OPPONENTS AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S- CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION HERE- THIS IS A- I THINK THE BILL. IS ABOUT A LEGITIMATE TOPIC AND SO IT'S OF CONCERN TO ME THAT THERE- MAY HAVE BEEN NO CONVERSATIONS. I'M GONNA GET OUT OF THE PROPONENTS IS THAT THE CASE- THANK YOU FOR THAT A QUESTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM AND GUESTS WE HAVE REACHED OUT MULTIPLE TIMES SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS AND- SINCE THIS BILL HAS BECOME ABOUT. CONTENT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE UNABLE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPONENTS AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE BUSINESS OPPOSITION SAYING THAT THEY HAVEN'T EVEN READ THE AMENDMENTS. WHICH WERE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL IT IS DISAPPOINTING THAT THEY WOULD CALL IN AND REGISTER THEIR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS TIME SEEING NONE ASSEMBLY WOMAN IRWIN DO WISH TO CLOSE I I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS A FEW OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS THAT ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER THERE IS A- A CONSTITUTIONAL UP- ISSUES. AND THAT WAS ADDRESSED A VERY ELOQUENTLY BY THE- COMMITTEE STAFF AND- THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE NARROWLY TAILORED AND- WE BELIEVE. THAT IT IS SECONDLY- WHEN ALL THE OPPONENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT- THAT THIS IS GOING TO- AFFECT THEIR BUSINESSES THEY ALSO SHOULD REMEMBER THE PROMISE THAT THEY MADE WHEN PROP SIXTY FOUR PASSED AND IT WAS WRITTEN BY. THE OPPONENTS THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE MARKETING TO CHILDREN AGAIN WE DO NOT NEED TO EXPAND. THE LEGAL MARKET ON THE BACKS OF. CHILDREN THIRD- THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT THIS WOULD ONLY ALLOW TOMBSTONE TYPE. ADVERTISING I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY I ASSUME THAT JUST MEANS BLOCK LETTERS LIKE ON A TOMBSTONE. BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF THE BILLBOARDS THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS A MATTER OF FACT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM WOULD AS LONG AS THEY DON'T ADVERTISE SPECIFIC. PRODUCTS OR INCLUDE DEPICTIONS OF- A MARIJUANA WANT TO STOP THE USE THE USE OF CARTOON CHARACTERS AND OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE. OF ENTICING TO CHILDREN SINCE THE LEGALIZATION OF ADULT USE OF CANNABIS THERE'S BEEN AN 18% INCREASE IN THE LIKELIHOOD OF LIFETIME USE AND A 23% INCREASE IN THE PAST THIRTY DAY USE. AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN CALIFORNIA MARKETING TO CHILDREN WORKS THAT'S WHY BIG TOBACCO DID IT. THAT'S WHY THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY DID IT AND I THINK IT'S TIME FOR SOME- COMMONSENSE RULES TO TALK ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF CONTENT SHOULD BE ALLOWED- FOR A DRUG THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS OF ALL AGES- SEE ON BILLBOARDS EVERYDAY SO WITH THAT. AGAIN MR SURE YOU WEREN'T HERE AT THE BEGINNING I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE EXTENSIVE WORK THAT YOU DID ON. THIS BILL AND- WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY WOMAN- AGAIN MY TECHNOLOGY THE HARD TO IGNORE JUST WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE STAFF TO WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICE.

AS MANY OF YOU KNOW DURING OUR SENSE OF HEARING THE COUNSEL OF FOR THIS COUNCIL WE DISCUSSED A NUMBER OF ISSUES IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND EXPLAINED WHY THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME THAT ALLOCATED. TOWARDS MOVING TOWARDS MASSAGE LICENSURE BY BOARD. WHILE THERE ARE POTENTIAL FLAWS IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM AS WE DISCUSSED WE ARE G. CONSIDERING THE CREATION OF A NEW LICENSE OR BOARD AND A NUMBER OF FACTORS TO CONSIDER THAT ARE MORE APPROPRIATELY DISCUSSED THE SUNRISE PROCESS- BUT AGAIN THIS IS A BILL. ADDITIONALLY STATES THAT IT IS OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS THROUGHOUT THE SUN RISE PROCESS OVER THE YEAR. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY VERY OWN DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERE IS HERE IN THE CHAMBERS A TO TESTIFY A WHILE I MAY NOT SEE HIM BACK AT HOME IN SILICON VALLEY I SEE HIM UP HERE IN OUR STATE CAPITOL. THAT'S THE KIND OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY HE IS I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM OPERATOR TO HAVE ANYBODY IN SUPPORT FOR A BI FIFTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT- IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES THE AIRLINES ARE OPEN. HELLO. THIS IS DOCTOR JEFFREY KUHLMAN CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CANCER. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DR JEFFREY FOREMAN AND ON THE ELECTED CHAIR OF THE C. A. M. P. CHEESE BOARD I WAS CHOSEN AT AND T. A. EDUCATE OF THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS I WAS A TENURED PROFESSOR OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION AT DE ANZA COLLEGE IN THE EARLY NINETIES I FOUNDED AND BECAME COORDINATOR OF THE PROFESSIONAL MASSAGE THERAPY DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS AT ANZA. UNOPPOSED IN LESS AMENDED TO THIS LEGISLATION MY OPPOSITION IS TO THE BURDENSOME EXPENSIVE AND INEFFECTIVE ADOPTION OF A LICENSING BOARD. TO REGULATE MASSAGE THERAPY. THE TIME I GREW WITH AND T. SUPPORT OF LICENSURE. THAT SUPPORT PREDATED THE LEGISLATURE'S DECISION TO CREATE C. A. M. P. C. AND ALLOW PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE. OF THE TRANSPARENCY OF LOCAL AND STATE COLLABORATION TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND ADVANCE THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF PROVIDERS. I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED BY THE ASSERTIONS THAT SEEING MTC IS NOT TRANSPARENT. DOES NOT AFFORD DUE PROCESS IN THE STATE CERTIFICATION OR LICENSING AGENCY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CONFRONT THE GROOM ISSUES OF EXPLOITATION. AND SEXUAL TRAFFICKING. I'M ALSO BOUGHT BY THE ALLEGATIONS SUGGESTING THAT A LACK OF A LICENSE PRECLUDES BILLING TO MEDICARE FOR NON OPIOID PAIN CONTROL TREATMENTS. ONE SUCH A SUGGESTION IS PATENTLY FALSE WE HAVE DOCUMENTATION TO VERIFY THIS. SUNSET HAS BEEN THE CONSTRUCTIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST THE C. A. M. P. C. I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. AND THE COMMITTEE TO FURTHER PROTECT CONSUMERS BY STRENGTHENING C. A. M. P. C. WE RECEIVE SUPPORT LEVIN LETTERS MULTIPLE SUPPORT LETTERS FROM SOURCES AS VARIED AS DELAYS SHERIFFS. POLICE CHIEFS AND ETHNIC ASSOCIATION. WITH WHOM WE'VE WORKED TO PROTECT IMMIGRANTS WE HAVE SUPPORT FROM SCHOOLS BUSINESSES AND EXPERTS IN DEALING WITH SEX TRAFFICKING LABOR TRAFFICKING AND SEXUAL ASSAULT THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR REALLY WONDERS YOUR TIME SLOTS PLEASE. YES IN THE SHORT TIME WE MADE A DIFFERENCE TO BRING MASSAGE THERAPY OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND INTO THE MAINSTREAM WE LOOK TO IMPROVE WE ASKED THE BILL BE AMENDED TO WORK TOWARDS. PERFECTING C. A. M. P. C. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT WAS IN OPPOSITION WE WERE GONNA GO TO SUPPORT TO RDA JEFF ROSEN YOU CAN STEP UP TO THE MIKE SIR. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND CHAMBER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. A GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S JEFF ROSEN I'M THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY. I'M HERE THIS MORNING IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. ONLY IF THE LANGUAGE ISN'T PLACE TO DISCUSS HOW TO ENHANCE THE EXTRAORDINARY CAPACITY. OF CMT C. WITH CMT C. WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT WORKS REMARKABLY WELL. CMT C. ALLOWS FOR THE GENTLEMAN THE SAUCE TO THRIVE AND PROVIDE. RELAXATION AND HEALTH CARE BENEFITS IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. THE REPORTING PART OF MANY CALIFORNIANS LIVES. AS DA I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE COMMUNITY SAFETY. AND I'M ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED TO THE CREATION OF A STATE BOARD FOR MASSAGE THERAPY AND A STATEWIDE LICENSE. THE CREATION OF A SLOW MOVING BUREAUCRATIC SACRAMENTO CENTRIC BOARD. THAT IS EXPENSIVE PONDEROUS DISTANCE FROM LOCAL INVOLVEMENT AND UNABLE TO. RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THE COMPLEXITIES IN THE MASSAGE INDUSTRY. IS SIMPLY ABOUT IDEA. AND WOULD BE A GIANT STEP BACKWARD. I JOIN WITH POLICE CHIEF LOCAL BUSINESSES CONSUMERS AND GROUPS WHICH PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE. IN SUPPORT OF CMT C. AND STRONGLY AGAINST THE IDEA OF THE STATE BOARD. AS DA I BECAME A BELIEVER IN C. M. D. C. BY WITNESSING FIRST HAND THE COLLABORATION. AND EFFICIENCY CMT C. BRINGS IN OUR BATTLE% AGAINST SEX TRAFFICKING. A STATE BOARD LACKS THE DEXTERITY OF CMT C. AND WOULD OPEN THE FLOODGATES OF HUMAN EXPLOITATION. THE CMT C. MODEL CREATED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. IS AN ENVIABLE EXAMPLE OF POWER COMMUNITIES BENEFIT FROM A DEDICATED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. SEEM TO SEE AS CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD STANDARDS AND A DISCIPLINARY MODEL BASED UPON DUE PROCESS. THAT IS FAIR TRANSPARENT AND PROTECTS THE COMMUNITY. DURING THE TOUGHEST MOMENTS OF THE COVERT PRIDE CRISIS. WE COULD STILL RELY ON CMT C. TO ANSWER THE CALL QUICKLY. AND RESPOND BOTH QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY. CMCC IS A MODEL THAT WORKS. I BELIEVE THAT SEEM TO SEE CAN WORK WITH MY FRIEND EVAN LOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND THIS LEGISLATURE AS THEY HAVE. IN PAST SUNSET HEARINGS TO CAN CAN YOU TO AND- THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO HAVE A CRISTINA- WHO WERE ON THE PHONE IN SUPPORT.
