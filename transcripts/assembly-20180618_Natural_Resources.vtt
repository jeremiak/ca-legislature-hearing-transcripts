WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM THAT WE

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.390 region:rollup2
WILL PROCEED AS SUBCOMMITTEE.

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:12.793 region:rollup2
SARAH Y. CASKET [inaudible]

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.761 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER MERITS.

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:16.697 region:rollup2
CG ARE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:18.065 region:rollup2
S. P. SIXTY FOUR IS TO ENSURE

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:20.500 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S INCREASE

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:22.302 region:rollup2
PENETRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.171 region:rollup2
AYE DOES NOT LEAD TO UNINTENDED

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:25.338 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF INCREASED AIR

00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:26.740 region:rollup2
POLLUTION.

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:28.608 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA ALREADY

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.709 region:rollup2
BURKE BREATHED SOME OF THE

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:31.678 region:rollup2
UNHEALTHY ASTAIRE AND NATION

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.280 region:rollup2
THIS PROTECTION WILL HELP ENSURE

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:33.914 region:rollup2
THAT THE AIR QUALITY DOES NOT

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.316 region:rollup2
GET ANY WORSE.

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:38.018 region:rollup2
SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM WE HAVE

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:40.020 region:rollup2
OUR POOR AIR QUALITY CALIFORNIA

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:41.588 region:rollup2
HAS SOME OF THE MOST POLLUTED

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.923 region:rollup2
AIR IN THE COUNTRY COMMUNITIES

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:44.224 region:rollup2
IN AREAS THROUGHOUT THE NORTH

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:44.991 region:rollup2
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.127 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:49.296 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE MANY DAYS WHEN AIR

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:52.132 region:rollup2
QUALITY THIS NOT MEET --

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:54.768 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE STANDARDS.

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:55.936 region:rollup2
THE OPERATION OF ONE POWER PLANT

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:59.039 region:rollup2
CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IN.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:04:01.508 region:rollup2
PACKED THE QUALITY OF THE AIR

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:03.744 region:rollup2
ENOUGH IN ANY LOCALITY EACH TURN

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:04.945 region:rollup2
OF POLLUTION CONCRETE AT FIRST.

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:06.346 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES IN MANY AREAS

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:08.248 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOT MEETING

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:09.716 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:11.451 region:rollup2
AND MODELING SHOWS THAT THE

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:13.086 region:rollup2
SINGLE POWER PLANT CAN NEARLY

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.954 region:rollup2
DOUBLE THE CONCENTRATIONS OF

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.223 region:rollup2
POLLUTANTS.

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:18.225 region:rollup2
ARM FROM BACKGROUND LEVELS SO

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:20.127 region:rollup2
CHANGING OPERATIONS THE POWER

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:22.295 region:rollup2
PLANTS IS LIKELY TO MAKE YOUR

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:23.263 region:rollup2
CALL THE WORSE IF IF WE DON'T

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:24.631 region:rollup2
CONSIDER AND MAKE CERTAIN

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.966 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS.

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:28.135 region:rollup2
LIKE HILL POWER PLANTS ARE

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:29.636 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO BE CYCLE MORE OFTEN

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:31.872 region:rollup2
MANY THE STATE'S NATURAL GAS

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:34.040 region:rollup2
POWER PLANTS ARE CONSTRUCTED TO

PROVIDE BASED POWER OR POWER

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.177 region:rollup2
ONLY DURING RARE PEAK NEEDS.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:38.812 region:rollup2
THIS IS CHANGING AS CALIFORNIA

00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:40.113 region:rollup2
BRINGS MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:42.415 region:rollup2
TO THE THE GREAT ESPECIALLY

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:44.284 region:rollup2
SOLAR ENERGY NATURAL GAS UNITS

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:46.186 region:rollup2

ELECTRICITY.

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:57.230 region:rollup2
CYCLING PRODUCES MORE EMISSIONS.

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:58.965 region:rollup2
SO CYCLING NATURAL GAS PLANTS BY

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.367 region:rollup2
STARTING STOPPING AN OPERATING

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:02.435 region:rollup2
AT PARTIAL LOADS PRODUCES

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:03.537 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE AIR POLLUTION

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:04.805 region:rollup2
THAN FACILITIES OPERATING IT

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:06.973 region:rollup2
BASELITZ.

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:09.009 region:rollup2
POLLUTION MAY INCREASE IF THIS

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:10.510 region:rollup2
IS NOT ADDRESS SO THIS INCREASE

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.546 region:rollup2
IN THE CYCLING HAS ALREADY

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.715 region:rollup2
STARTED CURRENT STUDY SUGGESTS

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:17.217 region:rollup2
THAT THIS ISSUE --

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:18.885 region:rollup2
WILL ONLY BECOME MORE ACUTE

00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:20.587 region:rollup2

NOW THE OPPOSITION HAS FOCUSED

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.743 region:rollup2
ON TWO PRIMARY ARGUMENTS FIRST

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.544 region:rollup2
THE POWER PLANT EMISSIONS ARE

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:53.380 region:rollup2

--

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:02.342 region:rollup2
SAT HOW THE CALIFORNIA

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:07.380 region:rollup2
IS.

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:09.149 region:rollup2
A AND GROUP THAT FOCUSES ON

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.484 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE THROUGHOUT

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:13.653 region:rollup2
THE STATE WE HAVE MEMBERS FROM

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:15.088 region:rollup2
THE SAN DIEGO BORDER ON

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.389 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH COALITION.

00:09:15.088 --> 00:09:18.591 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE MEMBERS IN RIVERSIDE

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.726 region:rollup2
COUNTY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.327 region:rollup2
THE BAY AREA ON THE CENTRAL

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:22.996 region:rollup2
COAST.

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:25.598 region:rollup2
AND AND WE HAVE WORKED ON AIR

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:27.667 region:rollup2
QUALITY AND ENERGY ISSUES FOR

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:29.135 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS ON AND WE STRONGLY

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:30.670 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS BILL IT'S TRULY

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:33.239 region:rollup2
NECESSARY AT THIS TIME BECAUSE

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.575 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE BREATHING

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:39.712 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE MOST UNHEALTHY.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:41.681 region:rollup2
AIR IN THE ENTIRE NATION --

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:50.190 region:rollup2
IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA

00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:52.358 region:rollup2
HAS EIGHT OF THE TOP TEN WORST

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.659 region:rollup2
CITY. TO KILL A MATTER POLLUTION

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:58.264 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:09:52.659 --> 00:10:00.033 region:rollup2
ON AND ONE SINGLE POWER PLANTS

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:03.169 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS CAN MAKE THAT

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:04.471 region:rollup2
POLLUTION NOTABLY WORSE.

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.772 region:rollup2
AND THE EXAMPLE THAT I WOULD

00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:07.073 region:rollup2
OFFER -- TO

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:08.908 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE AT THE CONCRETE

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:10.877 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE IS THAT PINOCHET ENERGY

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:12.545 region:rollup2
CENTER WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE

00:10:10.877 --> 00:10:13.780 region:rollup2
TOP FIVE MOST DISADVANTAGED

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:15.949 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.984 region:rollup2
I'M IN FRESNO COUNTY.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:19.652 region:rollup2
AT THAT FACILITY I'M HAD

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:21.421 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT MODELING DONE NOT

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:22.956 region:rollup2
WHEN IT WAS FIRST PERMITTED BY

00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:24.891 region:rollup2
THE AIR DISTRICT --

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:26.292 region:rollup2
AND ABOUT MODELING SHOWED THAT

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:28.595 region:rollup2
IT WOULD --

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:30.597 region:rollup2
RESULTS IN VIOLATIONS OF BOTH

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:32.165 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PARTICULATE

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:32.765 region:rollup2
MATTER STANDARD AND THE ANNUAL

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:37.136 region:rollup2
STANDARD ON IT WOULD RESULT IN

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:39.205 region:rollup2
--

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:41.107 region:rollup2
I EXCEEDED HIS OF OVER A OF A

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:43.143 region:rollup2
100%.

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:44.911 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR STANDARD SO

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:47.313 region:rollup2
THE CONTENTION THAT POWER PLANTS

00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:49.282 region:rollup2
ARE NOT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:50.350 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM AND IS BELIEVED BY

00:10:49.282 --> 00:10:51.918 region:rollup2
THAT MODELING FOR THAT

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.720 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PLANT THAT MODELING

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:55.522 region:rollup2
ONLY LOOKED AT STEADY STATE

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.257 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS IT DID NOT.

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:59.292 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT START UPS IN

00:10:57.257 --> 00:11:00.727 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR AND THIS IS

00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:02.562 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE PINOCHET IS

00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:04.797 region:rollup2
IN FACT STARTING AND STOPPING

00:11:02.562 --> 00:11:07.767 region:rollup2
NEARLY EVERYDAY.

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:09.636 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR EACH OF ITS FOUR UNITS

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:12.939 region:rollup2
STARTED OVER THREE HUNDRED AND

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:14.507 region:rollup2
SIXTY TIMES. ONE OF THE UNITS OF

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:18.044 region:rollup2
THE PANACHE PLANT HAD AND KNOCKS

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:20.079 region:rollup2
RATE OF ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:22.782 region:rollup2
POUNDS PER AND THE T. YOU.

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:24.951 region:rollup2
WHEN IT STARTS?

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:26.719 region:rollup2
BUT ITS STEADY STATE EMISSIONS

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:29.589 region:rollup2
ARE EIGHT POUNDS.

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:30.657 region:rollup2
PER AND BTO.

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:31.824 region:rollup2
GOOD I'M IN THIS MEANS I'M SORRY

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:33.092 region:rollup2
ETCETERA SO THE START UP

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:35.461 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS FOR THAT PARTICULAR

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:36.796 region:rollup2
PLANT ARE TEN TIMES MORE THAN

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:39.999 region:rollup2
THE STEADY STATE EMISSIONS.

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:41.935 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS REPLICATED IN OTHER

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:44.103 region:rollup2
PLANTS AROUND THE STATE BUT THE

00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:48.007 region:rollup2
STATE'S WERE NOT GENERALLY

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:52.445 region:rollup2
PERMITTED AS AS TO REFLECT THOSE

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:54.747 region:rollup2
VARIATIONS IN OPERATION.

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:56.849 region:rollup2
SO TO ADDRESS THIS THE BILL

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:58.685 region:rollup2
PROPOSED TO DO THREE THINGS --

00:11:56.849 --> 00:12:00.053 region:rollup2
IT REQUIRES DATA AND

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:01.521 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW THESE

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.622 region:rollup2
PLANTS ARE OPERATING.

00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:05.892 region:rollup2
SECOND IT REQUIRES THE AIR

00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:07.627 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:10.096 region:rollup2
THAT THE PLANTS ARE HAVING AND

00:12:07.627 --> 00:12:13.299 region:rollup2
TO CONDUCT ITS REGULAR --

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:14.701 region:rollup2
ANNUAL PERMIT REVIEWS TO REFLECT

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:16.369 region:rollup2
THE IMPACTS THE PLANTS ARE

00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:18.338 region:rollup2
HAVING AND TO COMMUNICATE WITH

00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:18.838 region:rollup2
THE BOUNCING AUTHORITY IN DOING

00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:20.440 region:rollup2
SO.

00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:23.643 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY IT REQUIRES THE

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.345 region:rollup2
STUDY THINK TANK.

00:12:23.643 --> 00:12:26.145 region:rollup2
GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:27.380 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND OR

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:28.615 region:rollup2
WHISTLIN ON THE SENIOR MANAGER

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.250 region:rollup2
WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED

00:12:28.615 --> 00:12:31.517 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS OUT WE'VE BEEN

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.819 region:rollup2
WORKING ON GRID MANAGEMENT

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:34.020 region:rollup2
ISSUES IN CONTINUING TO DO

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:35.722 region:rollup2
RESEARCH UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.357 region:rollup2
GREAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE

00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:38.291 region:rollup2
AS WE BRING ON MORE.

00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:40.260 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE ENERGY AND MEET OUR

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:42.028 region:rollup2
CLIMATE TARGETS I'M GONNA CUT MY

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.829 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY IN HALF AT LEAST

00:12:42.028 --> 00:12:44.364 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK SENATOR

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:45.798 region:rollup2
WIECKOWSKI IN CHINA DID A REALLY

00:12:44.364 --> 00:12:46.833 region:rollup2
COMPELLING JOB TALKING ABOUT

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:47.767 region:rollup2
WHAT THE BILL DAVID WHAT THE

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:48.701 region:rollup2
BILL.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.069 region:rollup2
DOES IN THE PROBLEM IT'S TRYING

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:51.504 region:rollup2
TO ACHIEVE OUT TO SAY THAT

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:53.339 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS CURRENTLY SUPPLIES

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:56.009 region:rollup2
ABOUT 40% OF OUR ELECTRICITY

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:57.176 region:rollup2
NEEDS AND WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:57.777 region:rollup2
A ROLE HONOR SYSTEM. FOR

00:12:57.176 --> 00:12:59.545 region:rollup2
SOMETIME AND I'M SAYING THIS

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.180 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WANT TO UNDERSCORE

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:02.181 region:rollup2
THAT THE PURPOSE OF SB SIXTY

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.117 region:rollup2
FOUR IS NOT TO INDISCRIMINATELY

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:05.718 region:rollup2
SHUT DOWN NATURAL GAS.

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.719 region:rollup2
RATHER THE BILL IS INTENDED TO

00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:08.388 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM WE'RE

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:09.489 region:rollup2
STARTING TO SEE HAPPEN AND WE

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:10.757 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S GOING TO GET A LOT

00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:12.158 region:rollup2
WORSE OVER TIME AND THAT'S THE

00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:13.926 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE FREQUENT INCREASE IN

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:14.861 region:rollup2
CYCLING OF THE GAS UNITS.

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:16.162 region:rollup2
AND THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE

00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:18.698 region:rollup2
IMPACT THAT THIS CAN HAVE ON AIR

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:20.566 region:rollup2
QUALITY ESPECIALES IN AREAS THAT

00:13:18.698 --> 00:13:21.234 region:rollup2
SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO GET

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:21.534 region:rollup2
THEIR AIR ANY DIRTIER

00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:23.803 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:25.071 region:rollup2
SO.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.039 region:rollup2
LIKE CHINA SAID BEFORE THE

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:27.307 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS THAT MANY OF THE

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:28.775 region:rollup2
STATE'S PLANTS WERE BUILT TO

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:30.943 region:rollup2
PROVIDE BASELOAD STEADY STATE

00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:33.179 region:rollup2
POWER NOT EXPECTED TO BE TURNED

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:34.180 region:rollup2
ON AND OFF ON A DAILY BASIS.

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:35.882 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT THIS MORE

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.683 region:rollup2
FREQUENT CYCLING WAS NOT

00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:38.451 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATED AND THEIR AIR

00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:40.186 region:rollup2
PERMITS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS

00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:41.487 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ADDRESS.

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:42.388 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.790 region:rollup2
ALREADY STARTING TO FEEL THE

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:45.091 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.392 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES IN THE STATE READ

00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:48.227 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE UNHEALTHY IS AIR IN

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:49.429 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY. FOR THESE REASONS

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:50.830 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL THAT

00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:52.665 region:rollup2
THE STATE SHIFT TO CLEANER NON

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.634 region:rollup2
FOSSIL RESOURCES AT THE SAME

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:56.636 region:rollup2
TIME THE STATE DOES NEED BETTER

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:59.238 region:rollup2
TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND HOW CHANGING

00:13:56.636 --> 00:14:01.307 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS PLANT OPERATIONS.

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:02.642 region:rollup2
MAY IMPACT AIR QUALITY AN

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:03.843 region:rollup2
EXPLICIT MECHANISM FOR AIR

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:05.712 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS TO COORDINATE WITH

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:07.246 region:rollup2
GRID OPERATORS TO REDUCE THE

00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:09.282 region:rollup2
DISPATCH OF NATURAL GAS PLANTS

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:10.983 region:rollup2
ON THE WORST AIR QUALITY DAYS.

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:12.752 region:rollup2
SB SIXTY FOUR WOULD ENSURE THAT

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:14.654 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S RAMP UP IN CLEAN

00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:16.255 region:rollup2
GENERATION DOES NOT LEAD TO THE

00:14:14.654 --> 00:14:17.590 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:18.491 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY CYCLING GAS POWER

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.392 region:rollup2
PLANTS.

00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:22.361 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT INCREASES AIR

00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:23.930 region:rollup2
POLLUTION.

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:25.231 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ANY FURTHER WITNESSES

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.499 region:rollup2

THE PROPOSED THE BILL POINT TO A

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:10.102 region:rollup2
FEAR THAT STARTUP SHUTDOWNS AND

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:11.737 region:rollup2

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:21.614 region:rollup2
REPLACED RETIRED A REPOWERED

00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:22.915 region:rollup2
ALSO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN

POWER PLANTS.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.089 region:rollup2
SUPPORTERS SUGGEST THAT THESE

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:31.057 region:rollup2
START UP SHUT DOWN CYCLING'S MAY

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:32.291 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR THE MAJORITY OF

OUR OPINION.

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:49.909 region:rollup2
ENERGY FACILITIES DO NOT HAVE AN

DOWN SAFELY ALTHOUGH THE BILL

00:16:52.612 --> 00:16:55.414 region:rollup2
DOES CONTAIN AN EXCEPTION WE

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.949 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT FOR CONTINUE

AS THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:09.295 region:rollup2
RIGHTLY POINTS OUT THERE MANY

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.263 region:rollup2
LAWS IN PLACE ALREADY REGULATED

00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:12.031 region:rollup2
VERY IMPACTS OUGHT TO BE

ADDRESSED BY THAT BILL. FOR

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.500 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE BILL SEEKS TO LIMIT

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:15.735 region:rollup2
LOCAL AIR EMISSIONS THROUGH YET

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.103 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PERMIT PROCESS BUT THE

ACTION DURING NON ATTAINMENT

00:17:25.845 --> 00:17:29.782 region:rollup2
DAVIS BUT THE AIRPORT IS ALREADY

00:17:28.681 --> 00:17:31.551 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO PREPARE DETAILED

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.853 region:rollup2
ON HOW TO ACHIEVE ATTAINMENT.

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:35.655 region:rollup2
BOTH THROUGH THE SET AND NOW

00:17:33.853 --> 00:17:37.356 region:rollup2
UNDER AB SIX SEVENTEEN ACTED

00:17:35.655 --> 00:17:38.457 region:rollup2
JUST LAST YEAR WHICH REQUIRES A

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:40.560 region:rollup2
LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TWO

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:42.895 region:rollup2
HOLISTICALLY EXAMINE LOCAL AIR

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.863 region:rollup2
QUALITY ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.064 region:rollup2
THE BILL ALSO SEEKS TO LIMIT THE

GENERATING UNITS SEEMINGLY IS A

00:17:46.332 --> 00:17:49.101 region:rollup2
MEANS TO ENCOURAGE ADDITIONAL

RENEWABLE PROCUREMENT.

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:51.871 region:rollup2
THE GENERATORS ARE RT A MANDATED

POLLUTION.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.849 region:rollup2
FINALLY AB ELEVEN THIRTY TWO

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:05.217 region:rollup2
ENACTED LAST YEAR ALREADY ALLOWS

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:06.452 region:rollup2
THE AIRPORTS ISSUED ABATEMENT

FACILITY.

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:12.291 region:rollup2
ENSURING THE DISADVANTAGED

00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:13.726 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE NOT

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:15.061 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY

00:18:13.726 --> 00:18:15.761 region:rollup2
OUR ENERGY POLICY IS A LAUDABLE

00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:17.096 region:rollup2
GOAL.

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:18.497 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THE

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:20.132 region:rollup2
METHODS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL OR

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:21.801 region:rollup2
CONVERT CUMBERSOME FRAUGHT WITH

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:23.002 region:rollup2
LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS THAT DON'T

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:25.504 region:rollup2
WORK WITH IN THE README REALITY

00:18:23.002 --> 00:18:26.072 region:rollup2
OF ENERGY RELIABILITY.

00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:27.673 region:rollup2
AND DOES NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:29.875 region:rollup2
HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF EXCEEDING ON

00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:32.712 region:rollup2
THIS SCHOOL. FOR THESE REASONS

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:33.312 region:rollup2
WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST IN NOVA.

00:18:32.712 --> 00:18:34.413 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I'M CHANCE BUT HE

ENERGY PRODUCERS --

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:39.452 region:rollup2
AND WE REPRESENT BOTH UTILITY

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.286 region:rollup2
SCALE RENEWABLE COULD A LOOK OF

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.854 region:rollup2
THE TODAY WE'RE HERE TO TALK

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:43.889 region:rollup2
ABOUT ARE GHASTLY AND THAT

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:46.058 region:rollup2
GASOLINE IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:47.393 region:rollup2
TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON INTO THAT

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:48.361 region:rollup2
MEET RELIABILITY NEEDS HERE IN

00:18:47.393 --> 00:18:49.695 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:51.998 region:rollup2
AND THERE SEEMS TO BE THIS

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:54.467 region:rollup2
FACTOID THAT SOME.

00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:55.434 region:rollup2
ON ALL THE GAS PLAN.

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.802 region:rollup2
COMMUTER ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:58.804 region:rollup2
GOALS -- IT

00:18:56.802 --> 00:19:00.506 region:rollup2
IS NECESSARY IT IT REALLY ISN'T

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:02.475 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT A MATTER IS --

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:03.309 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE S. B. THREE FIFTY

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:05.177 region:rollup2
STUDY WHICH WAS DONE AT THE

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:07.013 region:rollup2
BEHEST OF THE LEGISLATURE THE UP

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:09.048 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE I SO --

00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:11.117 region:rollup2
THE COMBINED CRITERIA POLLUTANTS

00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:12.485 region:rollup2
ABOUT 21% --

00:19:11.117 --> 00:19:13.786 region:rollup2
OF THE OF THE LOAD AT YOU CAN BE

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.587 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WHICH IT THE GHASTLY IS

00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:15.688 region:rollup2
1%.

00:19:14.587 --> 00:19:17.690 region:rollup2
OF THE COMBINED CRITERIA

00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:18.557 region:rollup2
POLLUTANTS SO IT IS NOT A AT A

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.259 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN I SAY ITS NOT

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:21.260 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FACTOR THAT'S WHAT

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.962 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.064 region:rollup2
THE THREE PARTS OF THIS BILL ONE

00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:26.432 region:rollup2
PART A LET'S GET THAT OFF THE

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:26.932 region:rollup2
TABLE RIGHT AWAY THE DATA.

00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:29.235 region:rollup2
THESE THESE PLANTS ARE

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:29.869 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED TWENTY

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:31.470 region:rollup2
FOUR SEVEN TO THE AIR DISTRICTS

00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:34.340 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT DATA OKAY THE AYE AYE

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.275 region:rollup2
THE P. A PARTNER THE AIRBOARD --

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.810 region:rollup2
THAT BASICALLY OF MONITORS THE

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:39.478 region:rollup2
CARBON OUTPUT OF THESE PLANTS SO

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.047 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES DATA AND PEOPLE WANNA

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:42.815 region:rollup2
PUT STUFF IN A IN A MORE USABLE

00:19:41.047 --> 00:19:44.050 region:rollup2
FORM GREAT HAVE AT IT BECAUSE

00:19:42.815 --> 00:19:45.618 region:rollup2
IT'S THERE --

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.720 region:rollup2
IN IN THOSE PLANTS OPERATE

00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:49.722 region:rollup2
WITHIN THEIR PERMITS --

STANDARDS.

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:56.729 region:rollup2
THEY COMPLY WITH ALL THOSE SO

00:19:54.727 --> 00:19:57.730 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S ISSUE ONE THAT THE

00:19:56.729 --> 00:19:59.532 region:rollup2
SECOND ISSUE WE TOOK --

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.833 region:rollup2
THE BILL DOES IN FACT THAT

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:02.768 region:rollup2
SECTION E. IN THIS BILL --

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:04.203 region:rollup2
BASICALLY STRUCTURE SOMETHING

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:05.705 region:rollup2
THAT LOOKS LIKE AN A AND THIS IS

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:07.673 region:rollup2
MORE OF AN ENERGY COMMITTEE --

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:08.274 region:rollup2
ISSUING MAYBE NOT HERE BUT IN

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:10.910 region:rollup2
ESSENCE PUTS THE AIR DISTRICTS

00:20:08.274 --> 00:20:11.510 region:rollup2
--

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.180 region:rollup2
IN IN IN IN THEIR ISSUANCE OF

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.614 region:rollup2
PERMITS WHICH POWER PLANTS

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.249 region:rollup2
OPERATE FIRST --

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:18.451 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN LEAVING THAT TO THE

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:19.952 region:rollup2
BALLOT SHEET AUTHORITIES WHICH

00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:21.087 region:rollup2
IS MORE APPROPRIATE --

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:23.022 region:rollup2
SO THAT SECTION IS VERY

00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:24.857 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC IT DOES HAVE SECTION

00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:26.559 region:rollup2
F. I THINK ITSELF THAT ALLOWS

00:20:24.857 --> 00:20:28.594 region:rollup2
THE BASIE BALANCING AUTHORITY TO

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.829 region:rollup2
BASICALLY OVERRIDE THAT INTO I

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:30.763 region:rollup2
AND THEY CAN HEAT WAVES WHEN WE

00:20:29.829 --> 00:20:32.098 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NEED TO BEAT THE AIR

00:20:30.763 --> 00:20:33.466 region:rollup2
CONDITIONING LOAD WHICH HAS.

00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:35.301 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY REAL HIGH HEALTH AND

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:36.969 region:rollup2
SAFETY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH IT

00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:38.537 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THE

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:40.139 region:rollup2
PLANT OPERATORS BUILT THE WAY

00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:40.940 region:rollup2
THIS ACTUALLY WORKS THEY PAY

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:41.340 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO WHAT'S IN THEIR

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.175 region:rollup2
PERMITS.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.677 region:rollup2
SO DAVID POLL THEY ONLY HAVE ONE

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:45.878 region:rollup2
START DEBT DAY THAT'S ALL

00:20:44.677 --> 00:20:47.480 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO DO SO IF IF THE

00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:48.981 region:rollup2
EYES SO WHERE THE LADY OF THE P.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.882 region:rollup2
OR BANK WHICH IS THE NORTHERN

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:51.417 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:54.019 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF TORY PICKS UP THE

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:54.186 region:rollup2
PHONE AND SAYS WE NEED YOU TO

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:56.388 region:rollup2
RUN.

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:57.022 region:rollup2
THEY WILL OKAY IT'S THEY'RE NOT

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:57.623 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:59.125 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO TRY TO GET IN

00:20:57.623 --> 00:21:00.493 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE BELGIAN AUTHORITIES

00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:02.128 region:rollup2
AIR DISTRICT THEIR CRIMINAL --

00:21:00.493 --> 00:21:04.029 region:rollup2
AND CIVIL LIABILITIES FOR NOT

00:21:02.128 --> 00:21:05.764 region:rollup2
LISTENING TO THE LOCAL AIRPORT

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:08.334 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:09.802 region:rollup2
AND SO IT IT EH AND TWO LAST

00:21:08.334 --> 00:21:11.470 region:rollup2
POINTS ONE I'LL.

00:21:09.802 --> 00:21:12.404 region:rollup2
ALSO POINT OUT IN THAT IN THIS

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.806 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THE COMMITTEE --

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:16.041 region:rollup2
IF THEY WANT TO TAKE A BROADER

00:21:13.806 --> 00:21:18.844 region:rollup2
VIEW ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:19.645 region:rollup2
CODE SECTION OF THE FINEST --

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:21.647 region:rollup2
A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:23.115 region:rollup2
IN THIS BILL WAS DESIGNED FOR

00:21:21.647 --> 00:21:24.984 region:rollup2
BASICALLY --

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:27.119 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTING CAT A CAP AND TRADE

00:21:24.984 --> 00:21:28.087 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR OF

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.388 region:rollup2
GAY AND THAT'S THAT'S FINE OF

00:21:28.087 --> 00:21:30.923 region:rollup2
THOSE WITH THE DID LEGISLATURE

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.857 region:rollup2
DECIDED IT WANTED TO DO.

00:21:30.923 --> 00:21:33.359 region:rollup2
BUT IT WASN'T DESIGNED TO PUT

00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:34.760 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:35.895 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES SO THAT THIS IS A

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.563 region:rollup2
SOMETHING YOU MAY WANT TO THINK

00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:38.364 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THE THAT IT'S SORT OF

00:21:37.563 --> 00:21:40.065 region:rollup2
AN EXPANSION.

00:21:38.364 --> 00:21:42.535 region:rollup2
OF THAT OF THAT DEFINITION IS

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:44.603 region:rollup2
BEING USED IN AREAS WHICH I

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:47.540 region:rollup2
THINK GOT CREATE SOME LEGAL --

00:21:44.603 --> 00:21:49.308 region:rollup2
MAGNUSON AND MAY LEAD.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.677 region:rollup2
TO FINALLY I THINK THERE'S ONE

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:53.212 region:rollup2
LAST ISSUE AND THAT IS --

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:54.747 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THESE POWER PLANTS --

00:21:53.212 --> 00:21:56.782 region:rollup2

00:22:01.587 --> 00:22:04.290 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VERY EFFICIENT DE MITA

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:06.025 region:rollup2

PORTRAYAL OF SOUTH BAY DOWN

00:22:16.969 --> 00:22:20.239 region:rollup2
SCADA LOW PLANTS THAT CLEARLY

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.307 region:rollup2
HAD IMPACT ON ABOUT WHAT I THINK

00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:22.675 region:rollup2
ALL OF US WOULD AGREE WERE

00:22:21.307 --> 00:22:24.210 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:25.511 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT POWER PLANTS

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.545 region:rollup2

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:29.862 region:rollup2
SERIES OF THE IN SAN JOAQUIN CAN

00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:31.897 region:rollup2
WE TURN ON PLANTS [inaudible]

00:25:29.862 --> 00:25:33.532 region:rollup2
IN.

00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:35.267 region:rollup2
THE INLAND EMPIRE AND DO THAT

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:37.536 region:rollup2
BALANCING ACT DO THE THAT THAT

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:39.638 region:rollup2
DECISION HAVE THAT DATA ON HAND

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:41.473 region:rollup2
THAT THE HERE DISTRICTS WILL BE

00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:43.375 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE.

00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:44.943 region:rollup2
OKAY SO.

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:46.445 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE IN YOUR

00:25:44.943 --> 00:25:47.946 region:rollup2
INTENT IS NOT.

00:25:46.445 --> 00:25:49.681 region:rollup2
TO SYSTEMATICALLY START SHUTTING

00:25:47.946 --> 00:25:51.750 region:rollup2
DOWN THESE PLANTS BUT I'M JUST

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:54.353 region:rollup2
CURIOUS DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:55.721 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS.

00:25:54.353 --> 00:25:57.790 region:rollup2
THAT HE BROUGHT UP SPECIFICALLY

00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:58.824 region:rollup2
RIGHT I MEAN I WOULD SAY FOR THE

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.526 region:rollup2
THE SECOND SHOCK ABOUT

00:25:58.824 --> 00:26:02.828 region:rollup2
SUBPARAGRAPH HE AND SUBPARAGRAPH

00:26:00.526 --> 00:26:04.963 region:rollup2
HAVE I DO AGREE THAT THAT'S THE

00:26:02.828 --> 00:26:06.465 region:rollup2
ENERGY AND UTILITIES.

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:07.966 region:rollup2
A A QUESTION.

00:26:06.465 --> 00:26:09.401 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THESE

00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:12.838 region:rollup2
PLANTS WERE GRANTED THEIR

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:14.440 region:rollup2
PERMITS IT WAS FOR BASELOAD NOW

00:26:12.838 --> 00:26:17.075 region:rollup2
WERE IN THIS DIFFERENT WORD ON A

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.844 region:rollup2
WORLD OF CYCLING THAT UP.

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:20.012 region:rollup2
STARTING IN AND AND GOING UP AND

00:26:18.844 --> 00:26:21.814 region:rollup2
DOWN AND UP AND DOWN SO THERE'S

00:26:20.012 --> 00:26:24.683 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT [inaudible]

00:26:21.814 --> 00:26:25.818 region:rollup2
POLLUTING --

00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:27.252 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTIC THAT THE PLANTS

00:26:25.818 --> 00:26:29.121 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT DOESN'T EXIST WHEN YOU

00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:32.324 region:rollup2
JUST HAVE THE OLD DAYS WHEN YOU

00:26:29.121 --> 00:26:34.326 region:rollup2
JUST RAN THAT THE NATURAL GAS --

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:35.627 region:rollup2
FACILITIES ALL OF ONE'S OKAY SO

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:37.429 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE IF I'M

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:39.198 region:rollup2
LUCKY THAT'S NEXT WEEK.

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:40.432 region:rollup2
ON THE STUDY AND AND THAT THE

00:26:39.198 --> 00:26:42.935 region:rollup2
PARTY THREE TO MISS THEM WON THE

00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:44.369 region:rollup2
POT AND PART THREE IS YOU KNOW

00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:46.205 region:rollup2
WHO GETS TO CHOOSE WILL THAT'S

00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:47.840 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT THE STUDY IS WE

00:26:46.205 --> 00:26:50.342 region:rollup2
WANT TO WE WANT TO GET AS A

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.410 region:rollup2
INVENTORY AND AN ANALYSIS OF

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:52.211 region:rollup2
WHERE ARE THEY HOW.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.814 region:rollup2
WHAT PLANTS ARE BEING USE WHAT

00:26:52.211 --> 00:26:58.250 region:rollup2
WHAT THE --

00:26:55.814 --> 00:27:00.285 region:rollup2
THE PLANTS ARE BEING CYCLE MORE

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.954 region:rollup2
OFTEN WHAT'S THE USAGE OF WHAT'S

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:03.155 region:rollup2
THE KNOCKS AND SOCKS AND ALL

00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:04.423 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE POLLUTION SO IT'S

00:27:03.155 --> 00:27:05.791 region:rollup2
COMING OUT OF IT.

00:27:04.423 --> 00:27:08.026 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THAT GETS BACK TO THE

00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:09.995 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE IS THIS DATA I MEAN

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:11.697 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY UNUSABLE I MEAN THE

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:13.465 region:rollup2
DATA NOW THESE FOLKS HAVE TO DO

00:27:11.697 --> 00:27:15.200 region:rollup2
A NEXT CELLS.

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:16.602 region:rollup2
SHE AND RENTED OUT THEN TRY TO

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:20.005 region:rollup2
MAKE CALCULATION SO WE DON'T

00:27:16.602 --> 00:27:22.174 region:rollup2
REALLY KNOW WE'RE IF WE CAN.

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:23.842 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THE OPERATION I MEAN.

00:27:22.174 --> 00:27:26.111 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT THE ISA

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:27.479 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY OH OKAY I GET IT WE

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:30.415 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:31.450 region:rollup2
BAD HAIR DAYS AND IN SOUTHERN

00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:33.519 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND ERIC.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:35.287 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S WINDY IN NORTHERN

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:36.688 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO LET'S JUST FLIP

00:27:35.287 --> 00:27:39.725 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:40.759 region:rollup2
DEAL MAYBE MY EXPERTS HAVE A

00:27:39.725 --> 00:27:41.760 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:43.161 region:rollup2
OR MORE CLARIFYING BUT I THINK

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.630 region:rollup2
THAT'S YOU KNOW I THINK YOU

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:48.634 region:rollup2
ANSWERED IT WELL ENOUGH --

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:50.269 region:rollup2
I JUST -- I

00:27:48.634 --> 00:27:51.937 region:rollup2
THINK YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR

00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:53.705 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY SOME CONCERNS WITH

00:27:51.937 --> 00:27:54.473 region:rollup2
WHAT DIRECTION THIS BILL IS

00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:55.641 region:rollup2
GOING IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE

00:27:54.473 --> 00:27:59.111 region:rollup2
STILL --

00:27:55.641 --> 00:28:00.512 region:rollup2
MAYBE WE LOOKING AT SOME

00:27:59.111 --> 00:28:02.314 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS ARE NOW.

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:03.582 region:rollup2
WELL I MEAN I GUESS I'VE GOT TO

00:28:02.314 --> 00:28:05.817 region:rollup2
GO TO ENERGY AND I'M I'M I'M

00:28:03.582 --> 00:28:07.119 region:rollup2
MINDFUL OF THAT THAT THIS IS

00:28:05.817 --> 00:28:09.655 region:rollup2
STEP ONE THAT THERE'S A STEP TO

00:28:07.119 --> 00:28:12.491 region:rollup2
THIS IS FOR THE AIR QUALITY.

00:28:09.655 --> 00:28:14.059 region:rollup2
AND KNOW THAT DATA A COLLECTION

00:28:12.491 --> 00:28:15.761 region:rollup2
IN THE STUDY ARE.

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:16.862 region:rollup2
LET'S WORRISOME BECAUSE YOU

00:28:15.761 --> 00:28:18.130 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T YOU HAVE A FOCUS TO

00:28:16.862 --> 00:28:20.299 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN I WILL WRAP THIS

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.799 region:rollup2
UP I APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING ONE

00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:25.170 region:rollup2
MORE TIME THAN NORMAL --

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:26.405 region:rollup2
IT'S THERE IS A GREATER AMOUNT

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.739 region:rollup2
OF POLLUTION AND I THINK THE

00:28:26.405 --> 00:28:29.041 region:rollup2
DATA BEARS THIS OUT OF COURSE

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:30.409 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S THE GREATER

00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:32.244 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF POLLUTION RETIREMENTS

00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:34.313 region:rollup2
COMING FROM AUTOMOBILES.

00:28:32.244 --> 00:28:36.048 region:rollup2
NOT FROM THESE PLANTS.

00:28:34.313 --> 00:28:37.216 region:rollup2
THE PLANTS WRECKED URBAN IT'S

00:28:36.048 --> 00:28:40.586 region:rollup2
PRETTY SMALL.

00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:42.754 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE IN COMPARISON SO.

00:28:40.586 --> 00:28:44.223 region:rollup2
RIGHT I THINK PART OF THIS IF IF

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:45.991 region:rollup2
IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR IS THAT IS

00:28:44.223 --> 00:28:47.693 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE HAVING DISCUSSIONS

00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:49.795 region:rollup2
ABOUT HER REGIONAL GRIT.

00:28:47.693 --> 00:28:51.063 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO IS

00:28:49.795 --> 00:28:52.197 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO GIVE US SOME

00:28:51.063 --> 00:28:54.132 region:rollup2
ARM.

00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:56.401 region:rollup2
OF PRINCIPLES THAT CALIFORNIA

00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:58.337 region:rollup2
STANDS FOR IN THE RENEWABLE

00:28:56.401 --> 00:29:00.439 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO BECAUSE NOT YOU KNOW I

00:28:58.337 --> 00:29:01.039 region:rollup2
WOULD AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION

00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:02.574 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA SENATE REALLY

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:04.476 region:rollup2
GOOD CHANCE.

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:06.178 region:rollup2
GOOD JOB OF UPDATING THEIR THEIR

00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:07.279 region:rollup2
AYE GAS FIRED PLANTS AND WE'VE

00:29:06.178 --> 00:29:08.880 region:rollup2
GOT IS LIKE SOMEBODY'S GOT A

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:10.248 region:rollup2
BRAND NEW CARS RUNNING BETTER IN

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.416 region:rollup2
THE FIFTEEN YEAR OLD CAR BELIEVE

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:13.518 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GONNA.

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:15.287 region:rollup2
BUT THIS WILL GIVE US SOME TOOLS

00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:16.555 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD APPLAUD THE

00:29:15.287 --> 00:29:18.457 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND NATURAL GAS

00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:20.225 region:rollup2
PRODUCERSWHEN WE GET INTO

00:29:18.457 --> 00:29:21.893 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR NEIGHBORS

00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:23.996 region:rollup2
ABOUT A REGIONAL GRID.

00:29:21.893 --> 00:29:24.963 region:rollup2
THESE ARE GONNA BE SOME BASELINE

00:29:23.996 --> 00:29:27.232 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:29.635 region:rollup2
HAVE WHERE WHERE ARE GAS.

00:29:27.232 --> 00:29:33.372 region:rollup2
FIRE PLANTER CLEAN IN YOUR GAS

00:29:29.635 --> 00:29:35.140 region:rollup2
FIRED PLANTS IN IN BE A US A I

00:29:33.372 --> 00:29:37.209 region:rollup2
GUESS WOULD BE CALLED THE

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.111 region:rollup2
BASELINE THAT I'D LIKE THAT.

00:29:37.209 --> 00:29:41.546 region:rollup2
HAVE OUR STATE USE WE GET INTO

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:46.385 region:rollup2
THESE DISCUSSIONS ON RELIABILITY

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:48.720 region:rollup2
AND THE BENEFITS OF THE REGIONAL

00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:50.989 region:rollup2
GREAT DISCUSSION.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.690 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU.

00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:53.425 region:rollup2
SENATOR.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.027 region:rollup2
I'M I'M INTO MY CONCERNS MIGHT

00:29:53.425 --> 00:29:55.594 region:rollup2
BE MORE FOR NEXT COMMITTEE WHERE

00:29:55.027 --> 00:29:59.931 region:rollup2
I SIT ALSO.

00:29:55.594 --> 00:30:01.033 region:rollup2
AND BUT I'M.

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:02.134 region:rollup2
I GUESS I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED

00:30:01.033 --> 00:30:03.835 region:rollup2
ABOUT SO I HAVE TO THE PLANTS

00:30:02.134 --> 00:30:05.337 region:rollup2
AND IN MY DISTRICT.

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:06.972 region:rollup2
YOU PLANT AND I ALSO THE ONE IN

00:30:05.337 --> 00:30:07.506 region:rollup2
IN TRACY IS RIGHT.

00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:08.807 region:rollup2
ALMOST RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:10.175 region:rollup2
ALTIMA.

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:11.343 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMMUTING FOUR

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:13.178 region:rollup2
HOURS A DAY [inaudible]

00:30:11.343 --> 00:30:14.713 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY.

00:30:13.178 --> 00:30:18.684 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE.

00:30:14.713 --> 00:30:19.284 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND SEVEN SWEET.

00:30:18.684 --> 00:30:21.320 region:rollup2
SO WHAT IF YOU BEGIN USING AIR

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:23.822 region:rollup2
CONDITIONERS.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.924 region:rollup2
SO IF WE'RE SAYING THAT IF THE

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:26.224 region:rollup2
PLANTS ARE NEEDED TO KEEP

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:27.693 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:29.928 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING OPERATING.

00:30:27.693 --> 00:30:30.529 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN.

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:33.732 region:rollup2
BUT IF THE AIR QUALITY IS TOO

00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:35.701 region:rollup2
BAD.

00:30:33.732 --> 00:30:36.868 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T LIST THEY NEED IT.

00:30:35.701 --> 00:30:39.371 region:rollup2
THEN IT SEEMS LIKE WERE NOT YOU

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:41.239 region:rollup2
NOT DOING THAT MUCH.

00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:43.442 region:rollup2
ON THE WORST DAYS YES ON THE ON

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:45.010 region:rollup2
THE ON THE ON HUNDRED AND SEVEN

00:30:43.442 --> 00:30:46.044 region:rollup2
AND TRACY WHEN WHEN WE GOT

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:49.081 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY HAVE THEIR AIR

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:50.549 region:rollup2
CONDITIONING ON PROBABLY NOT.

00:30:49.081 --> 00:30:52.451 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOT IT BUT IT'S ALL THE

00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:54.086 region:rollup2
IN BETWEEN STUFF.

00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:56.822 region:rollup2
IT'S ALL THE IN BETWEEN STEP

00:30:54.086 --> 00:30:58.957 region:rollup2
WERE NOT AT YOU KNOW AT A READY

00:30:56.822 --> 00:30:59.591 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:00.792 region:rollup2
THE GREAT THREATEN READY TO POP

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:03.095 region:rollup2
AND THAT YOU CAN HAVE THIS

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:05.097 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT THE AIR

00:31:03.095 --> 00:31:06.431 region:rollup2
QUALITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:31:05.097 --> 00:31:07.499 region:rollup2
IN IN THESE DIFFERENT REGIONS

00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:09.468 region:rollup2
AND SAY WELL.

00:31:07.499 --> 00:31:10.902 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT

00:31:09.468 --> 00:31:12.137 region:rollup2
HOURS AHEAD YOU SEE THIS IS

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:14.106 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD TO BE BAD AND

00:31:12.137 --> 00:31:18.143 region:rollup2
STOCKTON AND WE WANT TO TURN ON

00:31:14.106 --> 00:31:19.411 region:rollup2
THESE UNITS IN --

00:31:18.143 --> 00:31:20.879 region:rollup2
THE INLAND EMPIRE OR UP IN

00:31:19.411 --> 00:31:22.481 region:rollup2
HUMBOLDT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:25.183 region:rollup2
TO GET THAT POWER ON THAT

00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:26.785 region:rollup2
[inaudible] TO TO A UNDERSCORE

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:29.521 region:rollup2
THE RELIABILITY OF THE THE GRAD.

00:31:26.785 --> 00:31:31.189 region:rollup2
MAN I JUST PICKING ON YOU

00:31:29.521 --> 00:31:32.023 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE DISARRAY AS

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:33.558 region:rollup2
HE DOESN'T LIKE THIS BUT YOU

00:31:32.023 --> 00:31:34.126 region:rollup2
KNOW I MEAN THAT'S THE THAT'S

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:35.193 region:rollup2
RIGHT THE IS THAT IS THAT WE

00:31:34.126 --> 00:31:37.929 region:rollup2
GET.

00:31:35.193 --> 00:31:40.031 region:rollup2
THESE MORE MICRO BY AIR QUALITY

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:41.800 region:rollup2
POCKETS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:43.368 region:rollup2
TRYING.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.803 region:rollup2
TO TO COOPERATE WITH THE WITH

00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:46.438 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AND THE

00:31:44.803 --> 00:31:48.173 region:rollup2
BALANCING AUTHORITY AND GIVING

00:31:46.438 --> 00:31:49.241 region:rollup2
THEM THE INFORMATION THEY MAKE

00:31:48.173 --> 00:31:50.575 region:rollup2
THAT MANY OF THE COMPUTER SOUTH

00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:52.878 region:rollup2
THEY'RE UNBELIEVABLE THAT THEY

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:54.746 region:rollup2
MAKE THESE DECISIONS ON THAT

00:31:52.878 --> 00:31:55.947 region:rollup2
BALANCING IN THE DAY HAD MARKET

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:57.416 region:rollup2
IN THE FIFTEEN MINUTE MARKET.

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:59.851 region:rollup2
ON WHO NEEDS IT AND IS JUST

00:31:57.416 --> 00:32:02.087 region:rollup2
ANOTHER LITTLE INGREDIENT THAT

00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:03.955 region:rollup2
GOES IN ON WHAT'S THE AIR

00:32:02.087 --> 00:32:05.056 region:rollup2
QUALITY THERE AND TRACY I AT AT

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:06.491 region:rollup2
THIS TIME ORG OR THE NEXT TWENTY

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:07.559 region:rollup2
FOUR HOURS THAT'S REALLY WHERE I

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:09.528 region:rollup2
WANT TO END UP.

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:12.497 region:rollup2
UP WITH THIS IS THAT IT BECOMES

00:32:09.528 --> 00:32:14.833 region:rollup2
A A TOOL [inaudible]

00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:16.368 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT BUT AS WE WHO

00:32:14.833 --> 00:32:18.069 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS THE VALLEY WE

00:32:16.368 --> 00:32:20.038 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY HAVE AIR QUALITY ITS

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:22.040 region:rollup2
THE NATURE OF THE VALLEY RIGHT.

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:23.475 region:rollup2
THE BAY AREA BY HAS THOSE BIG --

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.209 region:rollup2
FANS A BLOW EVERYTHING AND ARE

00:32:23.475 --> 00:32:28.513 region:rollup2
MY DISTRICT [inaudible]

00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:30.215 region:rollup2
ON SO ALSO THOUGH BUT IT IN

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:31.016 region:rollup2
CREATING I MEAN SO SO THAT'S

00:32:30.215 --> 00:32:32.818 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE GIVEN EVERYONE KNOWS

00:32:31.016 --> 00:32:34.019 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE AIR QUALITY IN THE

00:32:32.818 --> 00:32:35.520 region:rollup2
VALLEY IS IS IS NOT A NOT GREAT

00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:36.421 region:rollup2
AND THAT NOTHING THAT'S OKAY BUT

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.689 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF ERRORS.

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:39.624 region:rollup2
OTHER VARIABLES THAT IMPACT THAT

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:40.859 region:rollup2
SUCH AS AGRICULTURE SUCH AS CAR

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:43.261 region:rollup2
SUCH AS DIESEL SUCH AS

00:32:40.859 --> 00:32:46.665 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE AND JUST AGAIN

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:48.733 region:rollup2
YOU'RE YOU'RE LIVING IN A BOWL.

00:32:46.665 --> 00:32:50.702 region:rollup2
BUT BUT BUT I I HOPE WE'RE NOT

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:51.603 region:rollup2
SAYING SOMETHING LIKE BECAUSE

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:53.104 region:rollup2
WITH MY TWO PLANTS WAS A PEOPLE

00:32:51.603 --> 00:32:54.306 region:rollup2
WHO ARE WHO ARE WORKING.

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:55.707 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THOUGH WE WANT GOOD AIR

00:32:54.306 --> 00:32:57.175 region:rollup2
QUALITY WE ALSO WANT.

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:58.376 region:rollup2
THE JOBS REMAIN AND PEOPLE HAVE

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:59.744 region:rollup2
MADE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:02.047 region:rollup2
THOSE PLANTS ARE MOST OF A MARK

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:03.448 region:rollup2
OVER FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AT THE

00:33:02.047 --> 00:33:04.850 region:rollup2
HUGE AMOUNT INVESTMENTS PEOPLE

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:06.518 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING THEY'RE GETTING.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.886 region:rollup2
GOOD PAYING GOOD JOBS AND WHAT

00:33:06.518 --> 00:33:09.487 region:rollup2
DO WE DO IT TO THE MARKET AND

00:33:07.886 --> 00:33:10.488 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO THE INDUSTRY WHEN WE

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:10.989 region:rollup2
SAY NOW THINGS ARE GONNA HAVE TO

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:12.224 region:rollup2
START.

00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.592 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT YOU'RE OFF YOUR ON YOUR

00:33:12.224 --> 00:33:14.693 region:rollup2
OFF YOUR OWN AND WHAT DOES THAT

00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:15.660 region:rollup2
DO [inaudible]

00:33:14.693 --> 00:33:18.697 region:rollup2
THE OVERALL [inaudible]

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.599 region:rollup2
THE PEACE OF MIND EMPLOYMENT

00:33:18.697 --> 00:33:22.000 region:rollup2
STABILITY ALTHOUGH RIGHT TO WEAR

00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:23.468 region:rollup2
BETTER BUT WE DON'T WANT TO

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.236 region:rollup2
TRANSPORT OUR JOBS TO THE INLAND

00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:25.570 region:rollup2
EMPIRE.

00:33:24.236 --> 00:33:27.439 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:29.174 region:rollup2
MISHAP MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW

00:33:27.439 --> 00:33:31.009 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN

00:33:29.174 --> 00:33:32.477 region:rollup2
WHEN WE REACH OUR RENEWABLE

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:35.180 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO STANDARDS MEAN WE'VE

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:40.485 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALREADY MADE THAT VOTE ON

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:43.221 region:rollup2
40% 50% IN THE CHANGE WITH THE

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:44.556 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES HAVING TO HAVE A

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:46.892 region:rollup2
BLEND OF MORE.

00:33:44.556 --> 00:33:48.593 region:rollup2
AYE SOLAR AND RENEWABLE THAT'S

00:33:46.892 --> 00:33:49.528 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE WITH

00:33:48.593 --> 00:33:51.796 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

00:33:49.528 --> 00:33:54.966 region:rollup2
SB SIXTY FOUR S. B. SIXTY FOUR

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:57.402 region:rollup2
HAS THE WRINKLE IF I MAY OF

00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:58.870 region:rollup2
GIVING US INFORMATION ABOUT THE

00:33:57.402 --> 00:34:01.373 region:rollup2
AIR QUALITY IN ALL THESE

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:01.606 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SUBSECTIONS BECAUSE IT

00:34:01.373 --> 00:34:04.543 region:rollup2
MAY BE.

00:34:01.606 --> 00:34:06.578 region:rollup2
NOT TURNING ON A CALPINE IN

00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:08.880 region:rollup2
HAYWARD BECAUSE IT'S THE WIND IS

00:34:06.578 --> 00:34:10.448 region:rollup2
BLOWING IN THIS COULD EXACERBATE

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.150 region:rollup2
STOCKTON AND TRACY VERSUS

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:13.852 region:rollup2
TURNING ON THE FACILITY IN

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:15.387 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR OR MID

00:34:13.852 --> 00:34:15.854 region:rollup2
STATE BECAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE

00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:17.689 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST.

00:34:15.854 --> 00:34:19.224 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S STUDYING THOSE THOSE

00:34:17.689 --> 00:34:20.859 region:rollup2
THINGS IN THE STUDY BUT AND THE

00:34:19.224 --> 00:34:22.594 region:rollup2
DATA AND THEN JUST THAT

00:34:20.859 --> 00:34:24.262 region:rollup2
COOPERATION.

00:34:22.594 --> 00:34:28.199 region:rollup2
WITH THE LOCAL AIRPORTS IN THE

00:34:24.262 --> 00:34:28.667 region:rollup2
CASE SO WHICH DOESN'T EXIST NOW.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.534 region:rollup2
AIRPORTS HAVE ALL THE

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:30.568 region:rollup2
INFORMATION BUT YOU'RE SAYING

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:32.270 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE MODELING

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:33.438 region:rollup2
STUDIES.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.506 region:rollup2
ON AMID THEY HAVE THE

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:36.808 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT AIR QUALITY.

00:34:34.506 --> 00:34:38.777 region:rollup2
RIGHT IT JUST ITCHES USABLE I

00:34:36.808 --> 00:34:40.745 region:rollup2
GUESS IS THE IS IS SO THAT WE

00:34:38.777 --> 00:34:45.383 region:rollup2
CAN WE CAN --

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:46.618 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT AND THIS IS AN

00:34:45.383 --> 00:34:48.486 region:rollup2
ELEMENT THAT WE'D LIKE TO FOR

00:34:46.618 --> 00:34:50.455 region:rollup2
THEM TO CONSIDER I'M NOT TRYING

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:51.623 region:rollup2
TO COMPROMISE RELIABILITY THAT'S

00:34:50.455 --> 00:34:52.657 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT.

00:34:51.623 --> 00:34:54.559 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE GOAL HERE IS JUST

00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:56.561 region:rollup2
TO SAY IF THERE'S A CHANCE THAT

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:58.029 region:rollup2
YOU CAN TURN OFF INSTEAD OF

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:58.830 region:rollup2
USING THE TREES TO FACILITY YOU

00:34:58.029 --> 00:35:00.131 region:rollup2
CAN USE.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.1000 region:rollup2
ONE AND ANOTHER PART OF AND

00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:03.668 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE RELIABILITY AND YOU

00:35:01.1000 --> 00:35:04.602 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE KNOW

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:07.305 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE THOSE.

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:08.740 region:rollup2
BAD HAIR DAYS HITS FOR SEVERAL

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:10.976 region:rollup2
DAYS IN A ROW IN ITS NICHE

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:13.244 region:rollup2
DECEMBER AND JANUARY AND THAT

00:35:10.976 --> 00:35:14.713 region:rollup2
KNOCKS ON JUST STARTING UP ONE

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:16.348 region:rollup2
OF THESE I THINK IT'S AND THIS

00:35:14.713 --> 00:35:18.617 region:rollup2
IS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT TIMES OF

00:35:16.348 --> 00:35:19.050 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS OR ITS EQUIVALENT OF

00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:20.952 region:rollup2
THIRTY EIGHT HOURS.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.654 region:rollup2
RUNNING IT AS A NORMAL WAY THAT

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:24.489 region:rollup2
WE WOULD RUN A GAS FIRED PLANT

00:35:22.654 --> 00:35:26.424 region:rollup2
VERSUS TURNING UP TURNING IT OFF

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:27.025 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE TRICK IS

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:36.234 region:rollup2
THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE ASSETS

00:35:27.025 --> 00:35:36.868 region:rollup2
--

00:35:36.234 --> 00:35:37.569 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING US

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:37.936 region:rollup2
WITH ENERGY AS WE MOWER WE'VE D.

00:35:37.569 --> 00:35:38.203 region:rollup2
CARBONIZED ARE.

00:35:37.936 --> 00:35:39.204 region:rollup2
ARE RUN.

00:35:38.203 --> 00:35:40.005 region:rollup2
ECONOMY TO EATEN US REQUESTS AND

00:35:39.204 --> 00:35:42.140 region:rollup2
AND NO END OF PERHAPS YOU CAN'T

00:35:40.005 --> 00:35:42.874 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT DOES THAT DO. FOR THE

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.042 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO HAVE MADE ALL THIS

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:45.110 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT AND THE PEOPLE WHO

00:35:44.042 --> 00:35:46.611 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING THERE WE START

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:48.213 region:rollup2
CYCLING OFTEN ON A DIFFERENT.

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:50.849 region:rollup2
AND TRANSFERRING AROUND WHAT

00:35:48.213 --> 00:35:53.718 region:rollup2
DOES THAT DO. TO THE INVESTMENTS

00:35:50.849 --> 00:35:55.253 region:rollup2
ARE MADE TO THESE FACILITIES.

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:56.721 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE GONE ALONG THAT BETTER

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:59.624 region:rollup2
BUT A NEW GENERATION TO WHAT THE

00:35:56.721 --> 00:36:01.326 region:rollup2
OLD FACILITIES WHERE.

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:02.427 region:rollup2
SO IF IF I MAY JUMP IN JUST A

00:36:01.326 --> 00:36:03.161 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT SO THAT YOU'RE

00:36:02.427 --> 00:36:04.629 region:rollup2
BRINGING UP THE FACT THAT

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:06.197 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:07.298 region:rollup2
WITHIN WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:08.700 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY SYSTEM THINGS ARE

00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:10.001 region:rollup2
MOVING VERY QUICKLY AND IT'S

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.469 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT THE

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:12.337 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION OF CRITERIA AIR

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:13.838 region:rollup2
POLLUTION.

00:36:12.337 --> 00:36:15.073 region:rollup2
FROM THE GAS FLEET IS RELATIVELY

00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:16.875 region:rollup2
LOW COMPARED TO MORE MOBILE

00:36:15.073 --> 00:36:19.010 region:rollup2
SOURCE SAYS BUT WE ALSO KNOW

00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:20.278 region:rollup2
THAT THAT COULD CHANGE OVER TIME

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.780 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE

00:36:20.278 --> 00:36:23.148 region:rollup2
PLANTS ARE CYCLING SO OFTEN.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.150 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

00:36:23.148 --> 00:36:27.519 region:rollup2
JUST MAKE IT MORE POSSIBLE FOR

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.820 region:rollup2
THE AIR DISTRICTS TO DO ANALYSIS

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:30.321 region:rollup2
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.323 region:rollup2
HOW THE INCREASE IN CYCLING

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:34.159 region:rollup2
COULD BE IMPACTING AIR QUALITY

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:36.227 region:rollup2
IN THEIR BASINS ANYONE AND THE

00:36:34.159 --> 00:36:37.295 region:rollup2
PART OF THE PUT THE LAST PART OF

00:36:36.227 --> 00:36:38.797 region:rollup2
THE BILL THAT SAYS?

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:40.432 region:rollup2
THAT P. YOU SEEN THIS C. E. C.

00:36:38.797 --> 00:36:42.801 region:rollup2
SHALL WORK TOGETHER TO DO A

00:36:40.432 --> 00:36:44.369 region:rollup2
STUDY ON WHAT THE LONG TERM

00:36:42.801 --> 00:36:45.937 region:rollup2
TURNED OUT OF GAS INEVITABLY

00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:47.706 region:rollup2
INEVITABLY WILL LOOK LIKE IS IN

00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:49.074 region:rollup2
PART TO PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY

00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:50.542 region:rollup2
TO THE MARKET.

00:36:49.074 --> 00:36:52.410 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHERE WE'RE HEADED BECAUSE

00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:54.579 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:56.281 region:rollup2
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW ABOUT.

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:57.816 region:rollup2
DO WE NEED THIS PLANT THE PLANT

00:36:56.281 --> 00:36:59.084 region:rollup2
CAN OPERATE BASED ON WHAT IT'S

00:36:57.816 --> 00:37:00.351 region:rollup2
GETTING PAID FOR RIGHT NOW SHE

00:36:59.084 --> 00:37:01.786 region:rollup2
WE GIVE IT MORE MONIES THAT CAN

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:02.954 region:rollup2
AND DO RETROFITS TO CONTINUE

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:04.355 region:rollup2
RUNNING BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

00:37:02.954 --> 00:37:05.724 region:rollup2
NECESSARY FOR RELIABILITY.

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:07.092 region:rollup2
IS OUR DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE

00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:08.460 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF HAPHAZARD

00:37:07.092 --> 00:37:10.161 region:rollup2
DECISIONS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:13.465 region:rollup2
AND THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE.

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:15.200 region:rollup2
A LONG TERM PLAN FOR THAT TURNED

00:37:13.465 --> 00:37:17.235 region:rollup2
OUT OF GAS WHICH WE'VE COMMITTED

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.736 region:rollup2
TO THROW CLIMATE POLICIES.

00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:20.138 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS THAT THE PLAN IS ONE

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:21.072 region:rollup2
THING BUT THEN WHEN WHEN YOU

00:37:20.138 --> 00:37:22.173 region:rollup2
START TALKING ABOUT.

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:23.742 region:rollup2
HER THEN YOU CAN CHECK THIS ONE

00:37:22.173 --> 00:37:24.943 region:rollup2
OFTEN TURN OVER THERE SO SO

00:37:23.742 --> 00:37:27.145 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING.

00:37:24.943 --> 00:37:28.613 region:rollup2
THE THE THE FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN

00:37:27.145 --> 00:37:29.314 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS ONE OF OUR OWN A AN

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:32.751 region:rollup2
ATTEMPT.

00:37:29.314 --> 00:37:34.285 region:rollup2
AT EXPERIMENTATION OF THE FUTURE

00:37:32.751 --> 00:37:35.987 region:rollup2
WHO KNOWS WHAT THE CURRENT

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:38.189 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IT'S UNCERTAIN YOU

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:39.691 region:rollup2
KNOW THE CASE SO CHU SAYS WE

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:41.793 region:rollup2
WANT YOU TO RAMP UP WE WANT YOU

00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:43.628 region:rollup2
TO SHUT DOWN THEY THEY DO THAT

00:37:41.793 --> 00:37:45.063 region:rollup2
ON A RELIABILITY WHICH IS ADDING

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:46.531 region:rollup2
ANOTHER BLEND OF WELL.

00:37:45.063 --> 00:37:48.032 region:rollup2
LET'S LOOK AT THE AIR QUALITY

00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:49.434 region:rollup2
WHEN WE MAKE THAT DECISION OR

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:50.702 region:rollup2
GET THAT GET THAT INFORMATION

00:37:49.434 --> 00:37:52.437 region:rollup2
THEIR QUALITY BECAUSE IT IS.

00:37:50.702 --> 00:37:53.104 region:rollup2
IT IS UNCERTAIN RIGHT NOW THAT

00:37:52.437 --> 00:37:54.572 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE PLANTS IN

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:57.609 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT REGIONS

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:59.010 region:rollup2
ARE STRUGGLING BECAUSE THEY WERE

00:37:57.609 --> 00:38:00.044 region:rollup2
GONNA GET SO MANY PEOPLE WORKING

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.713 region:rollup2
AND THEY IF THEY'RE ONLY

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:03.114 region:rollup2
OPERATING THREE DAYS SINCE OF

00:38:01.713 --> 00:38:03.681 region:rollup2
SEVEN DAYS THAT'S A ECONOMIC

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:05.183 region:rollup2
IMPACT.

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:07.719 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR

00:38:05.183 --> 00:38:09.420 region:rollup2
WITHOUT S. B. SIXTY FOUR WE'RE

00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:12.157 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT LET'S PUT IN BECAUSE

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.891 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT BE THAT ONE OF THOSE

00:38:12.157 --> 00:38:15.560 region:rollup2
PLANS.

00:38:12.891 --> 00:38:18.830 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT OPERATING SO OFF SO

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:20.465 region:rollup2
OFTEN BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVE

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.233 region:rollup2
AIR QUALITY MIGHT GET.

00:38:20.465 --> 00:38:24.402 region:rollup2
RAMPED UP IN THE STUDY MAY SHOW

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:26.104 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THIS IS THE THIS IS

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:28.239 region:rollup2
THE TO ONE FACILITY IT LOOKS

00:38:26.104 --> 00:38:29.607 region:rollup2
LIKE IT'S THE FIRST TO RETIRE

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:30.675 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THESE.

00:38:29.607 --> 00:38:34.679 region:rollup2
OTHER FACTORS AND THE AIR

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:36.781 region:rollup2
QUALITY.

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:39.050 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SIR MCCARTY.

00:38:36.781 --> 00:38:40.518 region:rollup2
THINK THAT I DIDN'T SEE THE AIR

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:43.288 region:rollup2
AIR BOARD I MEAN IN THE AIR

00:38:40.518 --> 00:38:45.557 region:rollup2
QUALITY.

00:38:43.288 --> 00:38:47.525 region:rollup2
DISTRICT FIT GROUP WAS A CALLED

00:38:45.557 --> 00:38:48.593 region:rollup2
CAP GO CAT GO OUT.

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:49.160 region:rollup2
KEPCO IT'S LATE MEANS NETWORKING

00:38:48.593 --> 00:38:50.995 region:rollup2
CAN CO I DIDN'T SEE THEM UP

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.564 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:53.198 region:rollup2
IN THE LINE UP AND THEY'RE THE

00:38:52.564 --> 00:38:54.699 region:rollup2
ONES WHO ARE A BIG PART OF THIS

00:38:53.198 --> 00:38:56.234 region:rollup2
--

00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:58.269 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING WITH THEM

00:38:56.234 --> 00:38:59.604 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT BEING

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:00.205 region:rollup2
THE ENTITY THAT WOULD BE.

00:38:59.604 --> 00:39:01.773 region:rollup2
AT THE FRONT LINES WORKING ON

00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:04.008 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:39:01.773 --> 00:39:05.777 region:rollup2
OKAY SO WE'VE HAD SEVERAL

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:06.711 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH AIR DISTRICTS

00:39:05.777 --> 00:39:07.979 region:rollup2
WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION WITH

00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:09.247 region:rollup2
SOUTH BECAUSE I PERSONALLY HAVE

00:39:07.979 --> 00:39:11.883 region:rollup2
NOT HAD A CONVERSATION WITH CAP

00:39:09.247 --> 00:39:12.917 region:rollup2
COLA BUT I THINK. TO PARAPHRASE

00:39:11.883 --> 00:39:14.485 region:rollup2
A CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:15.854 region:rollup2
THEY'VE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THIS

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:17.522 region:rollup2
COULD BE AN ISSUE IN FACT SOUTH

00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:19.157 region:rollup2
COAST HAS PUT SOME ANNUAL

00:39:17.522 --> 00:39:22.193 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS ON START STOPS

00:39:19.157 --> 00:39:23.761 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF CONCERNS I HAVE ON ON

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:24.796 region:rollup2
KNOCKS ISSUES.

00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:26.564 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S AN

00:39:24.796 --> 00:39:28.032 region:rollup2
ANNUAL LIMITATION ON START STOPS

00:39:26.564 --> 00:39:29.234 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE WORST

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:31.402 region:rollup2
AIR QUALITY DAYS SO.

00:39:29.234 --> 00:39:33.071 region:rollup2
SO THEORETICALLY THE LIMITATION

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:33.805 region:rollup2
COULD STILL ALLOW THE PLANT TO

00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:34.706 region:rollup2
START STOP IN THE DAYS THAT

00:39:33.805 --> 00:39:36.207 region:rollup2
WOULD.

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:37.809 region:rollup2
WHERE STARTING AND STOPPING

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:39.410 region:rollup2
WOULD EXACERBATE AIR QUALITY I

00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:40.678 region:rollup2
THINK BY THE AIR DISTRICTS HAVE

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.680 region:rollup2
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHOSE

00:39:40.678 --> 00:39:43.381 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO WRAP UP?

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.284 region:rollup2
WRAP UP THE DATA THAT'S

00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:48.653 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY BEING YEAH A AND MAKE

00:39:46.284 --> 00:39:50.188 region:rollup2
IT MORE ACCESSIBLE THEY DO THEY

00:39:48.653 --> 00:39:52.490 region:rollup2
ARE GETTING THAT DATA FROM EPA.

00:39:50.188 --> 00:39:54.158 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO WOULD

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.859 region:rollup2
BE TO REQUIRE THAT IT BECOME

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:55.627 region:rollup2
MORE ACCESSIBLE AND USER

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:58.429 region:rollup2
FRIENDLY.

00:39:55.627 --> 00:39:59.998 region:rollup2
SO IN OTHER SOME QUESTIONS.

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:01.799 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHO DOES THAT WHERE THEY

00:39:59.998 --> 00:40:03.368 region:rollup2
HAVE AN EXPRESS ANY CONCERNS ON

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:05.536 region:rollup2
THE TECHNICAL ASPECT OF THE

00:40:03.368 --> 00:40:06.571 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION NOT YET THEY

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:08.039 region:rollup2

WITH INFORMATION BUT NO.

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:15.580 region:rollup2
IF I MAY MR MCCARTY --

WHICH IS THE IMPACT OF THE THE

00:42:28.346 --> 00:42:31.182 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS POWER PLANTS

BE THAT YOU KNOW I MIGHT BE

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:23.194 region:rollup2
WRONG ON THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR.

00:44:20.358 --> 00:44:23.861 region:rollup2
A NOTICE I PICKED A TWENTY FOUR

00:44:23.194 --> 00:44:25.696 region:rollup2
HOUR BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE

00:44:23.861 --> 00:44:26.864 region:rollup2
WITH THE ACT CASE SO WHEN THEY

WHEN THEY WE DON'T.

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:31.269 region:rollup2
SET UP THERE A DELIVERY OF THEIR

00:44:29.267 --> 00:44:33.371 region:rollup2
ENERGIES AND THE NEXT THE NEXT

00:44:31.269 --> 00:44:33.671 region:rollup2
DAY ON WHAT THEY DECIDE

00:44:33.371 --> 00:44:34.305 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:38.743 region:rollup2
TO A CYCLE UPTURN AND CYCLE DOWN

00:44:34.305 --> 00:44:40.378 region:rollup2
--

00:44:38.743 --> 00:44:41.812 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T.

00:44:40.378 --> 00:44:43.414 region:rollup2
WE'RE DEALING WITH THE YOU KNOW

00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:44.849 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:46.450 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT'S IT'S VERY

00:44:44.849 --> 00:44:48.319 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR US TECH TO COME

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:50.021 region:rollup2
WITH AN ANSWER MAYBE OF A LITTLE

00:44:48.319 --> 00:44:51.622 region:rollup2
ABSTRACT THAT WERE A LITTLE

00:44:50.021 --> 00:44:53.391 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO SAY OKAY.

00:44:51.622 --> 00:44:55.326 region:rollup2
YOU YOU FOLKS ARE GOING TO HAVE

00:44:53.391 --> 00:44:58.095 region:rollup2
TO WORK TOGETHER BUT I THINK

00:44:55.326 --> 00:44:59.564 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IF THERE'S

00:44:58.095 --> 00:45:01.566 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CONCRETE.

00:44:59.564 --> 00:45:04.035 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED IN THE

00:45:01.566 --> 00:45:06.304 region:rollup2
BILL THAT MAKES IT UNWORKABLE

00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:08.706 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:45:06.304 --> 00:45:12.276 region:rollup2
I'M ALL EARS SADDAM I'M A

00:45:08.706 --> 00:45:14.712 region:rollup2
WILLING TO TO DO THAT BUT THE A

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:16.581 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION OF IT THAT WE NEED TO

00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:17.949 region:rollup2
GET THIS DATA WE NEED TO HAVE

00:45:16.581 --> 00:45:19.250 region:rollup2
SOME SORT OF STUDY WE NEED TO

00:45:17.949 --> 00:45:21.485 region:rollup2
HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:23.020 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH

00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:24.655 region:rollup2
THE AIR DISTRICT AND THE AND THE

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.957 region:rollup2
CASE SO I THINK THOSE WHO.

00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:29.193 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE --

00:45:25.957 --> 00:45:31.028 region:rollup2
DESIRABLE AND AND AGAIN AS I HAD

00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:31.562 region:rollup2
SAID MENTIONED TO A ASSEMBLY

00:45:31.028 --> 00:45:33.264 region:rollup2
MEMBER --

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:35.132 region:rollup2
MELINDA'S WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:45:33.264 --> 00:45:37.101 region:rollup2
TALKING REGIONALLY WITH OUR

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:38.936 region:rollup2
PARTNERS AND IT'S GOOD TO BE.

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:40.638 region:rollup2
IMPERATIVE THAT WE THEIR DEAD

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:42.073 region:rollup2
ADAM WE HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS

00:45:40.638 --> 00:45:43.908 region:rollup2
WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:45.109 region:rollup2
QUITE FRANKLY.

00:45:43.908 --> 00:45:48.312 region:rollup2
AS AS CLEAN.

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:50.881 region:rollup2
A DANCING MACHINE AS BECAUSE OF

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:52.516 region:rollup2
THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOS WE'VE PUT

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:55.186 region:rollup2
UP THERE BEFORE.

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:56.020 region:rollup2
SO I MAYBE YEAH NO JUST ADD THEM

00:45:55.186 --> 00:45:56.854 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM LIKE

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.256 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW

00:45:56.854 --> 00:46:00.224 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD ACTUALLY WORKING IN

00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:01.993 region:rollup2
REAL TIME SO THE TWENTY FOUR

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:04.829 region:rollup2
HOUR NOTICE IS MEANT. TO MAKE

00:46:01.993 --> 00:46:06.564 region:rollup2
SURE THAT ANY DECISION ABOUT --

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:08.065 region:rollup2
AN AIR AND AIR DISTRICT PLACING

00:46:06.564 --> 00:46:09.367 region:rollup2
A LIMITATION ON THE ABILITY OF A

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:11.302 region:rollup2
POWER PLANT TO START UP WOULD

00:46:09.367 --> 00:46:12.536 region:rollup2
HAPPEN WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE

00:46:11.302 --> 00:46:14.305 region:rollup2
AYE SO SETTING THEIR DISPATCH

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:15.473 region:rollup2
STACK FOR THE DAY HAD ENERGY

00:46:14.305 --> 00:46:16.741 region:rollup2
MARKET SO.

00:46:15.473 --> 00:46:17.842 region:rollup2
OTHER WOMAN FROM THE CHAMBER

00:46:16.741 --> 00:46:19.477 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW GREAT

00:46:17.842 --> 00:46:20.711 region:rollup2
RELIABILITY DECISIONS ARE BEING

00:46:19.477 --> 00:46:22.980 region:rollup2
MADE MINUTE BY MINUTE THAT'S

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:23.547 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND NOTHING

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.148 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE

00:46:23.547 --> 00:46:25.583 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:27.051 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF THE GRID OPERATOR TO

00:46:25.583 --> 00:46:28.819 region:rollup2
MAKE THOSE MINUTE BY MINUTE

00:46:27.051 --> 00:46:30.521 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THIS IS ALL PHYSICALLY

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:31.856 region:rollup2
IMPACTING WHAT WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:33.057 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE DAY HAD

00:46:31.856 --> 00:46:34.992 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY MARKET.

00:46:33.057 --> 00:46:36.627 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER INTENT IS FOR THE

00:46:34.992 --> 00:46:40.498 region:rollup2
AIR DISTRICTS TO DO AN ANALYSIS

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:42.500 region:rollup2
UP FRONT OF WHEN GENERATION MAY

00:46:40.498 --> 00:46:43.601 region:rollup2
BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING AIR

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.136 region:rollup2
QUALITY SO THAT WE'RE NOT

00:46:43.601 --> 00:46:46.704 region:rollup2
STARTING FROM A BLANK SLATE

00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:48.005 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:46:46.704 --> 00:46:49.740 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:51.542 region:rollup2
OF WHAT POWER PLANTS WE MIGHT BE

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.843 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT WHAT TIMES OF THE

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:54.145 region:rollup2
YEAR MIGHT BE MOST PROBLEMATIC

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:55.646 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:57.081 region:rollup2
WE GO WELL INTO THE WEE GO INTO

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:59.383 region:rollup2
SEASONS WELL IN ADVANCE

00:46:57.081 --> 00:47:00.985 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE OPTIONS

00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:02.486 region:rollup2
ARE WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE SO

00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:04.955 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT JUST MAKING THESE

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:06.991 region:rollup2
FLY BY NIGHT DECISIONS ARE AND I

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:09.327 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE [inaudible]

00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:11.529 region:rollup2
TO IT OF THE AUTHORS EPCIS ON

00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:13.230 region:rollup2
THE THE PLANNING AND THE DATA I

00:47:11.529 --> 00:47:13.864 region:rollup2
THINK THE PROBLEM ARISES WHEN

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.1000 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:18.169 region:rollup2
ARE AS MISTER SPUTNIK JONES

00:47:15.1000 --> 00:47:20.905 region:rollup2
INDICATED ARE GIVING THE POWER

00:47:18.169 --> 00:47:21.505 region:rollup2
TO THE AIR DISTRICTS. TWO

00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:23.908 region:rollup2
ENFORCE THESE OPERATING LIMITS

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:27.044 region:rollup2
--

00:47:23.908 --> 00:47:28.179 region:rollup2
AND AND AND AND AND SAID I THINK

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:30.047 region:rollup2
THERE IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION

00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:30.648 region:rollup2
AS TO WHETHER THE AIR DISTRICTS

00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:32.717 region:rollup2
ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO BE

00:47:30.648 --> 00:47:34.685 region:rollup2
--

00:47:32.717 --> 00:47:37.488 region:rollup2
DOING THAT JOB OF OF BALANCING

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:38.622 region:rollup2
THE POWER --

00:47:37.488 --> 00:47:40.291 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY WHICH HAS

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:42.026 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY BEEN AND THE THE

00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:44.161 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION OF OF OF THE N.

00:47:42.026 --> 00:47:45.463 region:rollup2
NELSON AND IS EVERYONE IN THIS

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:48.432 region:rollup2
ROOM KNOWS?

00:47:45.463 --> 00:47:49.633 region:rollup2
THIS IS A TOUGH PILL IN NATURAL

00:47:48.432 --> 00:47:52.269 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND THIS COULD BE A

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:54.338 region:rollup2
TOUGHER BILL AND ENERGY IN A A

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:55.639 region:rollup2
UTILITY SO I I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:47:54.338 --> 00:47:56.207 region:rollup2
I'VE TALKED WITH THE OPPOSITION

00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:58.075 region:rollup2
THEN AND WERE WELL AWARE BUT

00:47:56.207 --> 00:48:00.344 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:47:58.075 --> 00:48:02.680 region:rollup2
TRYING TO TO DEAL WIT THE AIR

00:48:00.344 --> 00:48:06.317 region:rollup2
QUALITY PORTIONS OF IT AND THE

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:08.452 region:rollup2
DESIRABILITY OF OF IT IN AND

00:48:06.317 --> 00:48:10.187 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH PART TWO ERIC WELL I

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:12.356 region:rollup2
ALSO SIT ON THE GO THE I KNOW I

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:14.358 region:rollup2
KNOW IT AND SOME GIVING A

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:15.392 region:rollup2
PREVIEW ACROSS OVER.

00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:17.094 region:rollup2
SORRY IF I MIGHT --

00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:19.029 region:rollup2
I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:20.197 region:rollup2
UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT

00:48:19.029 --> 00:48:22.333 region:rollup2
AND THE STATE CLEAN OUR CLEAN

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:25.202 region:rollup2
AIR ACT THE AIR DISTRICTS HAVE

00:48:22.333 --> 00:48:27.171 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSIBILITY SPECIFICALLY.

00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:29.407 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE

00:48:27.171 --> 00:48:31.409 region:rollup2
STATIONARY SOURCES NONE OF THEM

00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:32.443 region:rollup2
ARE OPERATING TO CONTRIBUTE TO

00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:34.378 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OF AIR QUALITY

00:48:32.443 --> 00:48:36.080 region:rollup2
STANDARDS THAT'S REALLY ALL THAT

00:48:34.378 --> 00:48:39.283 region:rollup2
WE'RE ASKING TO HAVE HAPPEN HERE

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.650 region:rollup2
SO IT'S TRUE AS AND THE KEPT HER

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:42.286 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE.

NEGOTIATED WITH.

01:00:52.716 --> 01:00:55.919 region:rollup2
GINA MCCARTHY WHEN SHE IS THE

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:57.354 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATOR OF THE US EPA I

01:00:55.919 --> 01:00:59.122 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT

01:00:57.354 --> 01:01:00.423 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WERE WILLING. TO TO

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:00.891 region:rollup2
MOVE SITES AS WELL AS OTHERS

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:03.026 region:rollup2
HAVE HAVE [inaudible]

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:04.294 region:rollup2
DONE.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:06.229 region:rollup2
BUT AT THIS TIME PART ARE PRETTY

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:07.998 region:rollup2
PREDOMINANT CONCERN IS STILL THE

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:09.166 region:rollup2
SAFETY OF THE EMPLOYEES AND THAT

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.333 region:rollup2
THEN THE PEOPLE IN THE BUILDINGS

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:11.568 region:rollup2
AND UNITS.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.936 region:rollup2
THAT WILL HAVE THESE

01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:14.037 region:rollup2
REFRIGERANTS THAT THAT ARE

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:15.372 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY TOXIC AND

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:16.873 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY FLAMMABLE WHEN

01:01:15.372 --> 01:01:19.276 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO THE CURRENT.

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:20.377 region:rollup2
IN COMMON USE MATERIALS.

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:21.678 region:rollup2
AND O FOR THAT I THINK THERE'S

01:01:20.377 --> 01:01:23.213 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OTHERS THAT THAT WILL

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:24.147 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED SIMILAR CONCERNS BUT

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:25.048 region:rollup2

WHAT THE CO TIMINGS ARE THERE

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.092 region:rollup2
WILL NOT BE ADOPTED CODES FOR

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:37.661 region:rollup2
THESE FLAMMABLE UNITS BY THAT

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:38.895 region:rollup2
TIME?

01:01:37.661 --> 01:01:40.463 region:rollup2
AND IF WE'RE WILLING TO LOCK

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:42.866 region:rollup2
THAT IN AND NOT GIVE AIR BE THE

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:43.033 region:rollup2
DISCRETION TO MOVE TIMELINES ON

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.601 region:rollup2
US.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.936 region:rollup2
THEN WE CAN CERTAINLY.

01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:48.972 region:rollup2
BUT AT THIS POINT GIVING THEM

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:49.539 region:rollup2
THE SOLE DISTRACTION WHEN

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:51.041 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT EXPERTS ON EACH

FOLLOW THE CALIFORNIA MECHANICAL

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:33.416 region:rollup2
CODE WHICH IS BASED ON THE

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:35.752 region:rollup2
UNIFORM MECHANICAL CODE ADOPTED

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:37.921 region:rollup2
EVERY THREE YEARS WE CANNOT BE

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:42.792 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:45.362 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'RE AT POSE UNLESS

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:47.897 region:rollup2

ALL OVER THE WORLD.

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:01.231 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT THEY'RE NOT

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:02.298 region:rollup2
IN USE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.967 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ASK YOU

AND OUR FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:20.183 region:rollup2
SO WE A WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:21.484 region:rollup2

WE'RE CLEAR ON WHAT THE

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:30.794 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY BASED ON WHAT.

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:32.562 region:rollup2
TITLE TWENTY FOUR STANDARDS

01:05:30.794 --> 01:05:34.097 region:rollup2
FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS THE TYPES

01:05:32.562 --> 01:05:36.633 region:rollup2
OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT EPA WILL

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:37.801 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO EVALUATE TODAY TO

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:40.003 region:rollup2
DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE IN FACT

01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:41.938 region:rollup2
IS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE.

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:43.506 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN BUT WE WE DO OPPOSE

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.674 region:rollup2

BILL KIND OF YOU KNOW KIND OF

01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:32.822 region:rollup2
SIDE STEPS I'M VERY CONCERNED

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:34.223 region:rollup2
ABOUT A SO --

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:35.424 region:rollup2
IT IS MIX OF THEY ARE MAKE YOU

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:36.425 region:rollup2
WOULD MIND I'M ASK THEM THAT

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:37.760 region:rollup2
WITH CHAIRS DOSE AGAIN I'M WATER

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:38.895 region:rollup2
THE RELEVANT CODES AND STANDARDS

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.129 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE TO BE ACHIEVED BEFORE

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:41.297 region:rollup2
YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:42.632 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENTS WHAT ARE WE MISSING

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.866 region:rollup2
THEIR THESE YOU MENTIONED IT.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:45.468 region:rollup2
EARLIER ON YEAH I THINK FIRST

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:47.303 region:rollup2
AND FOREMOST WE HAVE TO GET THE

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:48.838 region:rollup2
THE UNIFORM A CANTICLE CODE IN

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:50.673 region:rollup2
PLACE TO ALLOW FOR A TWO WELLS

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:51.741 region:rollup2
RICHARD OR THE MILDLY FINAL

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:53.109 region:rollup2
REFRIGERANTS.

01:11:51.741 --> 01:11:54.544 region:rollup2
WHICH WHICH IS A BIG PART OF

01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:56.612 region:rollup2
THIS NOT NOW THERE MAY BE SOME

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:58.047 region:rollup2
FOLKS OUT THERE WHO HAVE WITH

01:11:56.612 --> 01:12:00.216 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A OF A B..

01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:02.618 region:rollup2
TO WHICH IT IS HIGHER TOXICITY

01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:04.153 region:rollup2
BUT BUT LOWER FLAMMABILITY ERRED

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:05.688 region:rollup2
IN ALONG THOSE LINES YOU SEE SO

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:07.156 region:rollup2
THERE'S A NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:09.959 region:rollup2
ARE COMING OUT THEN YOU HAVE

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:12.395 region:rollup2
SOME SOME GLIDES WITCHER --

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:13.396 region:rollup2
KIND OF BLAND'S MEN AND IN OUR

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:14.530 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE IT AS CARRIER WE

01:12:13.396 --> 01:12:15.832 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT YOU KNOW GOING

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:18.868 region:rollup2
THAT BLENDED OR OUTGOING EARLY

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:19.435 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO GET TO THE THIRTEEN

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:19.635 region:rollup2
EIGHTY THREE GOAL BASED ARM

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:20.837 region:rollup2
MALI.

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:22.471 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT EXTRA TIME COULD

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:23.739 region:rollup2
BE USED FOR FOR RECYCLING

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:26.542 region:rollup2
RECOVERY OF EXISTING REFERRED

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:26.842 region:rollup2
ANGELES HAS A LIKE 9% ACCORDING

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:28.044 region:rollup2
TO AIR BEES.

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:29.679 region:rollup2
NOW SAYS.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:32.014 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THAT WERE UNSUPPORTIVE

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:33.649 region:rollup2
OF GOING THE LOW GWP PATHWAY

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:36.519 region:rollup2
WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:38.054 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'RE A HAD HAD.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:39.222 region:rollup2
THE ENGINEERING STAFF AND AND

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:41.357 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE STAFF FLYING BACK AND

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:42.258 region:rollup2
FORTH TO TO WORK ON THE COULD

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.559 region:rollup2
ALL YOU GREEN.

01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:46.229 region:rollup2
AND AND ALL THOSE NEGOTIATED

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:47.964 region:rollup2
POLICIES BUT WE HAVE YOU KNOW IF

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:50.166 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT THE SNAP RULE IT IT

01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:50.600 region:rollup2
FOR CHILLERS IT SAYS TWENTY

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:51.767 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR AND THE

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.502 region:rollup2
JUSTIFICATION IS. TOO LOUD

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:55.104 region:rollup2
RELEVANT CODES AND STANDARDS TO

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:56.105 region:rollup2
GET A PLACE THAT INCLUDES THE

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:57.506 region:rollup2
FIRE CODES.

01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:59.742 region:rollup2
THE FIRE CODES IT IF IF YOU'RE

01:12:57.506 --> 01:13:01.143 region:rollup2
MOVING TOWARDS A A PROPANE OR OR

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:02.078 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR AND THIS

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:03.813 region:rollup2
ISN'T TALKING.

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:05.514 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:13:03.813 --> 01:13:07.216 region:rollup2
FIFTY GRAMS A HUNDRED FIFTY

01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:09.385 region:rollup2
GRAMS AN INTERPRETER AT WORK

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:11.454 region:rollup2
WERE TALKING POUNDS OR TONS.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.855 region:rollup2
IF IT'S A MUCH GREATER QUANTITY

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:15.224 region:rollup2
IN THESE BUILDINGS.

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:16.759 region:rollup2
YEAH I I I APPRECIATE THAT AND I

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:18.361 region:rollup2
THINK THE RECYCLING PIECE OF

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:19.528 region:rollup2
THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE

01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:21.931 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE MOVING TO THE RECYCLE

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:23.266 region:rollup2
AND REUSE WARY DO AN AUTOMOTIVE

01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:25.701 region:rollup2
FIGHT COME FROM THAT WORLD AND

01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:27.703 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN IT THERE FOR YEARS --

01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:30.506 region:rollup2
IT'S REQUIREMENT --

01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:31.674 region:rollup2
IS NOW THAT THE THE SHEET METAL

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:32.942 region:rollup2
WAS THAT YOU CAN'T TO SET THINGS

01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:33.843 region:rollup2
RIGHT I'M CITING CATCH YOUR NAME

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:36.846 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT I'D MIX NAY BUT NEVER

01:13:33.843 --> 01:13:38.147 region:rollup2
GROUP CHRIS WATER CHRIS WALKER

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:41.050 region:rollup2
OKAY THINKS CHRIS APPRECIATED --

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:42.318 region:rollup2
MISTER WALKER SO.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.419 region:rollup2
KIND OF A GUY CAN TO THAT WAS

01:13:42.318 --> 01:13:45.354 region:rollup2
WHAT SAFETY STANDARDS THAT'S

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:48.157 region:rollup2
JUST THE TALK CITY TOXIC CITY

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:48.925 region:rollup2
TOXICITY OR FLAMMABILITY NEED TO

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:50.626 region:rollup2
BE MET.

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:52.094 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO ENSURE ANY REPLACE SOME

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:54.363 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS ARE SAFE FOR THE

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:55.064 region:rollup2
INSTALLERS AND TECHNICIANS --

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:57.133 region:rollup2
FOR YOU KNOW CURRENT PER

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:59.702 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FUTURE YOU MENTIONED

01:13:57.133 --> 01:14:00.236 region:rollup2
SAFETY UP ANOTHER ANOTHER --

01:13:59.702 --> 01:14:03.806 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBER MENTIONED

01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:05.775 region:rollup2
SAFETY HAVING SOME EXPERTISE OR

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:07.043 region:rollup2
SOME EXPERIENCE IN THIS WORLD I

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:08.644 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU KNOW

01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:10.513 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T.

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:11.814 region:rollup2
OUR TWELVE ARE ONE THIRTY FOUR A

01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:12.281 region:rollup2
IN YOUR CAR AND THEY JUST MIX

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:14.350 region:rollup2
AND NEXT MESS UP YOUR

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:16.385 region:rollup2
COMPRESSOR.

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:19.021 region:rollup2
THIS IS FAR MANY MAGNITUDES

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:21.123 region:rollup2
ABOVE THAT SO WE GAVE AUTOMOBILE

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:22.758 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS NATIONWIDE MANY

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:24.493 region:rollup2
YEARS TO PHASE THAT BOTH

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:26.729 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS AND AND THE CONSUMER

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:28.030 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS FOR REPLACEMENTS AND

01:14:26.729 --> 01:14:29.966 region:rollup2
FOR OUR TWELVE IN ITS ETRE.

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:31.634 region:rollup2
A BEFORE WE YOU KNOW COMPLETELY

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:32.568 region:rollup2
PUSHED IN PRICE AT THE MARKET

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:33.936 region:rollup2
THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER SYSTEM

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:35.171 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT'S IN YOUR AUTOMOBILE

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:36.439 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY THESE BUILDINGS

01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:38.174 region:rollup2
ARE REPLACED EVERY YEAR LIKE.

01:14:36.439 --> 01:14:40.343 region:rollup2
THE OUR TOUR FOR YEARS OR SIX

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:41.811 region:rollup2
YEARS LIKE A CAR SO CAN YOU

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:43.179 region:rollup2
TOUCH ON THAT THAT --

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:44.313 region:rollup2
SURE TOXICITY EARLY CAN WE CAN

01:14:43.179 --> 01:14:45.781 region:rollup2
WE HAVE I MEAN WHAT WE HAVE

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:47.116 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE USING HYDRA

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:49.118 region:rollup2
FLUOROCARBONS WHICH ARE NOT

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:51.420 region:rollup2
PREFERABLE GIVEN THE GWP THAT

01:14:49.118 --> 01:14:52.288 region:rollup2
LOCAL WORKING POTENTIAL OF THESE

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.089 region:rollup2
GASES.

01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:54.824 region:rollup2
ARE THE SAFEST OUT THERE RIGHT

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:56.025 region:rollup2
NOW ANYTHING THAT WE GO --

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:58.361 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO GO DOWN THE THAT

01:14:56.025 --> 01:14:59.829 region:rollup2
THAT THE PATH OF MORE TOXIC OR

01:14:58.361 --> 01:15:01.497 region:rollup2
MORE FLAMMABLE AND EVERYTHING'S

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:02.732 region:rollup2
A TRADE OFF.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:04.066 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW WE'RE

01:15:02.732 --> 01:15:05.768 region:rollup2
GONNA HANDLE THESE THINGS IT'S A

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:07.203 region:rollup2
VERY DELIBERATIVE PROCESS WITH

01:15:05.768 --> 01:15:08.604 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY WITH MANUFACTURERS

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:11.273 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:12.508 region:rollup2
ARE LABOR IT CETERA IN HOW ARE

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:14.010 region:rollup2
WE GONNA WRAP OURSELVES WHAT CAN

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:15.845 region:rollup2
A CODES NEED TO BE ADOPTED TO

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:17.613 region:rollup2
HANDLE IF MORE FLAMMABLE

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:18.948 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE FOR EXAMPLE OR FOR

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:19.682 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE DEALING WITH A MORE

01:15:18.948 --> 01:15:21.183 region:rollup2
TOXIC SUBSTANCE.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:23.152 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE CODES I HAVE TO GO

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:24.487 region:rollup2
AROUND THAT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:26.288 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE

01:15:24.487 --> 01:15:27.823 region:rollup2
ATMOSPHERE --

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:29.125 region:rollup2
IN IN IN THE INDUSTRY ARE

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:30.393 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMPANIES ARE ARE

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:32.194 region:rollup2
TRYING TO USE THE PROCESS TO GET

01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:33.562 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF OTHERS WE JUST

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:35.331 region:rollup2
INSTALLED PROBE THAT THE

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:37.266 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT WE MAINTAIN THE

01:15:35.331 --> 01:15:38.567 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE.

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:40.302 region:rollup2
THAT WE GET THERE WE GET THERE

01:15:38.567 --> 01:15:41.837 region:rollup2
SAFELY -- WE

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:42.938 region:rollup2
DO YOU THINK THAT THAT CAN

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:44.774 region:rollup2
HAPPEN --

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:47.276 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE WE'RE NOT.

01:15:44.774 --> 01:15:48.644 region:rollup2
OBJECTING TO TIMELINES BUT WE

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:49.211 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CODE

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:51.247 region:rollup2
BODIES AREN'T BEING STEPPED

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:52.615 region:rollup2
OVER.

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:55.084 region:rollup2
AND DISREGARDED WE NEED THOSE

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:55.985 region:rollup2
COLORED BODIES TO BE LOCK STEP

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:57.720 region:rollup2
WITH WHATEVER THEY ARE BE IS

01:15:55.985 --> 01:15:59.722 region:rollup2
DOING CURRENTLY THE BILL DOES

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.223 region:rollup2
NOT ALLOW THAT IT ALLOWS THEY

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:02.858 region:rollup2
ARE BE. TO CIRCUMVENT THE CODE

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:04.026 region:rollup2
BODIES.

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:05.694 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THERE WAS A REASON WHY

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:07.329 region:rollup2
HAD YOU GO SECOND --

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:08.931 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:11.801 region:rollup2
A MANUFACTURER'S STANDPOINT --

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:13.669 region:rollup2
I'M TECHNOLOGY OR MANUFACTURING

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:15.070 region:rollup2
GNOSTIC ON THIS BUT THEN IT

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:15.971 region:rollup2
COMES DOWN TO BECAUSE THEY CAN

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:18.407 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA WIN OR LOSE THAT

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:20.009 region:rollup2
BATTLE BUT THEN IT COMES DOWN TO

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:21.577 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL YOU KNOW BOOTS ON THE

01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:22.578 region:rollup2
GROUND AND THESE ARE FOLKS THAT.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.113 region:rollup2
THAT WITH ALL RESPECT TO THE

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:25.681 region:rollup2
AUTHOR THAT THAT ARE ACTUALLY

01:16:24.113 --> 01:16:27.817 region:rollup2
DOING THIS WORK AND THERE'S A

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:29.051 region:rollup2
LOT OF AREAS HERE THAT I HEAR

01:16:27.817 --> 01:16:30.653 region:rollup2
FROM -- MY

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:32.555 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS AND FROM THE H.

01:16:30.653 --> 01:16:33.989 region:rollup2
BACK INSTALLERS JUST.

01:16:32.555 --> 01:16:36.258 region:rollup2
TODAY --

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:37.526 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AND I I WANNA I

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:39.495 region:rollup2
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:42.164 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING HERE IF YOU

01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:43.432 region:rollup2
HAVE TO REPLACE OR REPAIR UNITS

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:46.101 region:rollup2
YOU COULD BE IN A SITUATION THIS

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:47.470 region:rollup2
AUGUST.

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:49.271 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WITH OUR HEAT

01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:50.739 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.874 region:rollup2
IT DEPENDING WHAT CARD DOESN'T

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:52.441 region:rollup2
HOW FAST THEY MOVE I'M NOT THIS

01:16:51.874 --> 01:16:53.409 region:rollup2
AUGUST BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:55.044 region:rollup2
SAYING.

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:56.245 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE SITUATIONS THAT WE

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:58.080 region:rollup2
FIND OURSELVES IN WERE WERE

01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:59.748 region:rollup2
GETTING AHEAD OF THE TECHNOLOGY

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.117 region:rollup2
OR GETTING AHEAD OF THE RAGS

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:03.085 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CAN'T IGNORE THE

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:04.553 region:rollup2
REGULATORY THE SAFETY --

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:05.554 region:rollup2
AND THAT AND SIDE OF THIS THING

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.155 region:rollup2
AND I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:06.722 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:17:06.155 --> 01:17:10.159 region:rollup2
I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:11.694 region:rollup2
CONCEPT TRYING TO DO HERE --

01:17:10.159 --> 01:17:13.629 region:rollup2
MISTER LARA BUT IT WOULD JUST

01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:15.364 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALMOST SAID WE HAVE THIS

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.432 region:rollup2
THIS BIFURCATION AND I JUST

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.433 region:rollup2
SIMPLY NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:18.968 region:rollup2
I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY

01:17:17.433 --> 01:17:21.036 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD REALLY WANT.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:22.104 region:rollup2
THIS TO BE FIXED SOMEWHERE ALONG

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:22.771 region:rollup2
THE LINE HERE BECAUSE I THINK

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:24.373 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GOING HEADLONG

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:25.741 region:rollup2
INTO A TO AN ISSUE THAT I'VE

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:28.644 region:rollup2
SEEN BEFORE SOMEONE IS.

ADDRESSES ONLY CHILLERS SNAP.

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:53.869 region:rollup2
DEALS WITH THAT AND CHILLERS ARE

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.404 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND UNLIKE YOUR HOME

01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:03.279 region:rollup2
ROOM.

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:05.247 region:rollup2
SERVICE BY PROFESSIONALS

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:06.415 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY ALARMED VENTILATION

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:09.885 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS WELL SPECIFIED

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:11.020 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE THAT'S TODAY.

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:13.122 region:rollup2
ALL THE LEADING KILLER MANY

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:14.857 region:rollup2
FACTORS INCLUDING CARRIER HAS

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:16.325 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE OPTIONS SO MUCH OF

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:18.827 region:rollup2
PLAYABLE SOME WHICH ARE NOT --

01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:19.395 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A PRODUCT CALLED ONE

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:21.096 region:rollup2
TWO THREE THREE Z. DE WHICH

01:18:19.395 --> 01:18:23.666 region:rollup2

DAIKIN AND OTHERS SELL TODAY

01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:26.268 region:rollup2
THAT IS NON FLAMMABLE I

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:28.370 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THEY'RE USED IN.

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:29.638 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA JUST RECENTLY

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:32.074 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A PRESS RELEASE WHERE

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:33.242 region:rollup2
A TRAIN REPLACE THE FOR CHILLERS

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:36.278 region:rollup2
IN THE CHANNEL WHICH IS THE

01:18:33.242 --> 01:18:37.179 region:rollup2
TYPICAL PANEL DOES UNDER THE AND

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:37.846 region:rollup2
FROM THE UK FRANCE.

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:41.016 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY WERE PLACED FOR LARGE

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:42.318 region:rollup2
CHILLERS WITH BREEZY DE CHILLERS

01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:45.487 region:rollup2
TRAIN AND REDUCED --

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:46.055 region:rollup2
THOSE CHILLERS IN TWENTY

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:48.524 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN SO GIVING THEM TEN

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:49.325 region:rollup2
YEARS TIME SEEMS TO YOUR POINT

01:18:48.524 --> 01:18:51.660 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE TOO

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:52.728 region:rollup2
QUICKLY BUT TENURE SEEMS.

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.296 region:rollup2
THAT REASONABLY PROVED THERE

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:56.565 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIFTEEN PEOPLE TODAY

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:58.801 region:rollup2
OFFERING LOW GDP CHILLERS WITH

01:18:56.565 --> 01:19:00.703 region:rollup2
REGARD TO THE CODES THE OTHER

01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:03.405 region:rollup2
CODE BODIES HAVE ALREADY

01:19:00.703 --> 01:19:03.939 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED WITH NICOLE.

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:04.974 region:rollup2
INDIRECT SYSTEMS WHICH ARE

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:06.408 region:rollup2
CHILLERS.

01:19:04.974 --> 01:19:07.176 region:rollup2
A DIRECT ESTAMOS IN YOUR HOME

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.310 region:rollup2
THE AIR CONDITIONER THE

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:09.912 region:rollup2
REFRIGERANT COULD FLOW THROUGH

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:12.948 region:rollup2
BUT INDIRECT SYSTEM ALL THAT

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:14.249 region:rollup2
REFRIGERANT STAYS EITHER IN THAT

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:14.750 region:rollup2
LOCKED MECHANICAL ROOM OR SO I

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:17.253 region:rollup2
THINK IT IS A DIFFERENT

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:18.220 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:18.921 region:rollup2
IF I MAY MISTER WITH YOUR

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.223 region:rollup2
SOLDIERS ARE BECAUSE IT WAS

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:22.191 region:rollup2
DIRECTED AT ME --

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:23.392 region:rollup2
IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION I

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:25.194 region:rollup2
HAD I UNDERSTAND WE'RE TALKING

01:19:23.392 --> 01:19:27.296 region:rollup2
ABOUT CHILL BUT WE'RE ALSO

01:19:25.194 --> 01:19:28.464 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT YOUR EAR YOU YOU

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:29.665 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO GO DOWN TO ONE

01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:30.566 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURER THAT'S NOT THE

01:19:29.665 --> 01:19:31.934 region:rollup2
ISSUE HERE.

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:33.235 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE THAT I WAS TRYING TO

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:34.703 region:rollup2
GET AT IS THE FACT THAT.

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:36.472 region:rollup2
THERE ARE FOLKS FROM INDUSTRY

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:37.606 region:rollup2
THAT ARE COMING TO US AND SAYING

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:39.775 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T THERE ARE LEGITIMATE

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:41.210 region:rollup2
SAFETY CONCERNS HERE SO AYE I

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:42.111 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK WE WE NEED TO GOING

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:43.312 region:rollup2
TO BACK AND FORTH ALREADY STATED

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:45.714 region:rollup2
MY POSITION.

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:47.182 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:48.984 region:rollup2
THE THE THE THOUSANDS OF

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:50.319 region:rollup2
TECHNICIANS OUT THEIR THAT WE'RE

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:52.187 region:rollup2
GONNA GET A HEAD OF FROM THE

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:54.089 region:rollup2
SAFETY STANDPOINT I'VE TALKED TO

01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:58.193 region:rollup2
I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE IN

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:59.795 region:rollup2
BUILDING AND SAFETY IN CODES I

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:01.597 region:rollup2

OF FOLKS.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:19.948 region:rollup2
ARE NOT TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:21.917 region:rollup2
THAT DIDN'T BUT AGAIN WE'RE

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:23.752 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT CHILLERS HERE

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:24.353 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT.

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:26.021 region:rollup2
A TRACK SYSTEMS AND WILL YOU

01:20:24.353 --> 01:20:28.023 region:rollup2
HAVE A METHODICAL APPROACH WHEN

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:30.959 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO BUILDING SAFETY AND

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:32.261 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS FITS OUR TIMELINES.

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:32.995 region:rollup2
A IT WE JUST WANT TO CONFLATE

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:35.164 region:rollup2
THE TWO ISSUES AND MAKE IT

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:36.965 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OF THE FACT IS THAT

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.466 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY EXIST.

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:38.600 region:rollup2
AYE AND THE FACT THAT WE

01:20:37.466 --> 01:20:39.668 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.170 region:rollup2
SAT UP THE TABLE AND HAVE A

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:43.505 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH INDUSTRY AND

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:44.506 region:rollup2
BROUGHT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:46.275 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IN SUPPORT OF THE

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:47.142 region:rollup2
MEASURE SHOULDN'T SURPRISE YOU

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:48.644 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT MY

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:50.245 region:rollup2
FIRST RODEO --

01:20:48.644 --> 01:20:51.480 region:rollup2
AND WE ACTUALLY LISTEN TO

01:20:50.245 --> 01:20:52.514 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY AND SO WE HAVE A BIG

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.782 region:rollup2
SEGMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:55.150 region:rollup2
WHO'S IN SUPPORT.

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:56.318 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:58.153 region:rollup2
NEED THE TIME GOING TO NEED THE

01:20:56.318 --> 01:21:00.089 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:20:58.153 --> 01:21:03.158 region:rollup2
OF THAT WHEN EPA RULES.

01:21:00.089 --> 01:21:04.526 region:rollup2
THAT E. R. R. UM.

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:05.894 region:rollup2
RTP HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:07.363 region:rollup2
ADOPT TO WHATEVER NEW

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:08.530 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES ARE BEING ADDRESSED

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:09.598 region:rollup2
OR WHATEVER THEN THE DEADLINES

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:11.967 region:rollup2
ARE TIMES ARE.

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:13.335 region:rollup2
SO I MEAN I THINK WE'VE DONE OUR

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:14.937 region:rollup2
DUE DILIGENCE IN TRYING TO

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:16.171 region:rollup2
REALLY GET TO THE CRUX OF THE

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:17.172 region:rollup2
ISSUE HERE BUT DON'T WANT TO

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:21.043 region:rollup2
CONFLATE.

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:23.278 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES BETWEEN A TRAP AND

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:24.613 region:rollup2
