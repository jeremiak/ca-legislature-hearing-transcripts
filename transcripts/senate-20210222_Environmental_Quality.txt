TO PRESENT SB SEVEN THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS SAID GOOD AFTERNOON HAPPY MONDAY AND GRATEFUL TO BE WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR SB SEVEN IS PRO TO MACINNES LEGISLATION LEGISLATION TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS OUR STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS CAN GET CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY MOVING AGAIN FROM THIS COMPANY INTO RECEPTION THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION IT EXTENDS AND EXPANDS PROVISIONS OF A SEQUEL STREAMLINING STATUTE KNOWN AS AB NINE HUNDRED. WHICH REDUCE PAPERWORK AN EXPEDITED LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LARGE MULTI BENEFIT HOUSING ENERGY AND MANUFACTURING PROJECTS SB SEVEN EXTENDS THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SUNSET OF AB NINE HUNDRED THROUGH THE END OF YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOR THE LARGER PROJECTS COUNTRY COVERED UNDER THE PRIOR LAW. BUT THIS LEGISLATION WILL ALSO EXPAND THE LAW TO APPLY STREAMLINING TO MUCH SMALLER HOUSING PROJECTS LOWERING THE THRESHOLD OF QUALIFYING PROJECTS TO FIFTEEN MILLION NOW THIS IS AN INVESTMENT OVER THE PRIOR LAW. UNDER SB SEVEN HOUSING PROJECTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE AT LEAST BE INFILL PROJECTS AND THEY NEED TO MEET THE SKILLED AND TRAINED LABOR REQUIREMENTS IN ELEVATED IN ELEVATED ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS NOW SB SEVEN MAY APPEAR FAMILIAR TO THIS COMMITTEE IN FACT THE VERY SIMILAR BILL MOVE FORWARD LAST YEAR SB NINE NINE FIVE THAT PASSES COMMITTEE IT PASSED THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE FLOOR ON A BIPARTISAN VOTE. SB NINE NINE FIVE ALSO PASSED THE ASSEMBLY WITH OVER SIXTY VOTES STRUCTURE MEMBERS BUT UNFORTUNATELY FAILED TO RETURN TO THE SENATE FOR CONCURRENCE VOTE BEFORE THE SESSION EXPIRED THIS PAST AUGUST NOW SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THEY NOW SUNSET AB NINE HUNDRED HAS RESULTED IN EXPEDITED APPROVAL NEARLY TWENTY MAJOR NEW CLEAN ENERGY AN INFILL PROJECTS. THAT REPRESENTS TWO BILLION TWO BILLION INVEST IN THE STATE AND IN THOUSANDS OF NEW HOUSING UNITS IN HIGH WAGE FAMILY SUSTAINING JOBS. SB SEVEN. HOUSING THAT EXPANSION WILL ALSO BUILD UPON THE SUCCESS IN RESERVE RESULT IN MORE HOUSING AND JOBS IN CALIFORNIA WHEN WE NEED IT MOST WHEN OUR ECONOMY IS CHALLENGE. AB NINE HUNDRED MODEL HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT HAS BEEN REPLICATED IN OTHER LARGE PRACTICAL DECISIONS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE GOLDEN ONE ARENA WHICH RESULT IN AN ECONOMIC RENAISSANCE RIGHT HERE IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO. TO THE APPLE WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN CORPORATE CORPORATE TINO. A CUPERTINO IN IT HAS A. 1-690-001-0080 SEVEN JOBS. UNDER THE INFORMATION FROM THE OFFICE A PLANE RESEARCH. I AND OUR OWN SENATE OFFICE RESEARCH PROJECTS APPROVED UNDER THE AB NINE HUNDRED PROCESS HAS PROVIDED MORE THAN TEN. THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS. WITH THE EXPANDED PROVISIONS OF SB SEVEN WE CAN EXPECT MANY MORE HOUSING UNITS TO BE TO USE THIS PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO GET BILL. ALSO CONSIDER THIS AB NINE HUNDRED HAD ALSO WAS APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY TO LARGE HOUSING AN INFILL DEVELOPMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE THE CROSSROADS HOLLYWOOD PROJECT CREATES NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN NEW HOUSING UNITS. AT THE HOUSE THE HOLLYWOOD CENTER PROJECT. EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO UNITS WITH A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE OF THOSE SLATED AS AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOMES. THE PATERNAL POWER STATION IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S A MIXED USE WATERFRONT REVIVAL PROJECT THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND YEARS HOUSING UNITS. ALL UNDER THE AB NINE HUNDRED FORMULA. IT PAST EXPERIENCES IS ANY INDICATION EXTENSION AND EXPANSION THE LAW TO SMALLER HOUSING PROJECTS THAT HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY HELP WITH EXPERT EX EXPEDITED. CONSTRUCTION IN. THE PROVISION OF NEW HOUSING STARTS. CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUED HOUSING SHORTAGE IS A MAJOR STRAIN ON THE STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND FUTURE AS WELL AS ON THE GOLDEN STATE SOCIAL WELFARE. MEDICAL AND PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEMS ARE STATE TO LOWER INCOME FAMILIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE KOBLET. RECESSION IN AT A GREATER RISK FOR HOUSING INSTABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS AS WELL AS LESSEN CHANCES FOR UPWARD MOBILITY. SB SEVEN OFFERS A STRATEGIC WAY TO ADDRESS A HOUSING SHORTAGE BY INCENTIVIZING PRODUCTION IN EXPEDITING THE TIME FRAME FOR ALL TYPES OF HOUSING TO BE ABLE TO BE BUILT.
