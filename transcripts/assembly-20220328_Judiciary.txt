THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS THEY ARRIVE THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON THIS BILL AND I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE WHICH WILL EXTEND EVICTION PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS WHO HAVE FILED FOR EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE BY THE END OF THIS MONTH. SINCE THE RENT RELIEF PROGRAM LAUNCHED ONE YEAR AGO CALIFORNIANS HAVE A CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION IN DELIVERING ASSISTANCE TO THOSE MOST IN NEED AND AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOUSING THE STATE PROGRAM HAS DELIVERED OVER TWO POINT FOUR SIX BILLION IN DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO DATE HELPING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PAY OFF RENTAL DEBT AND AVOID EVICTION. ONE IN THREE PAYMENTS NATIONALLY HAVE BEEN MADE IN CALIFORNIA TO TENANTS AND LANDLORDS IN NEED BUT IT IS TAKING LONGER THAN EXPECTED FOR THE STATE TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS FOR COVERT NINETEEN EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE THOUSANDS CONTINUE TO WAIT FOR RELIEF WHILE THEIR APPLICATIONS TEND. IT WOULD BE CRUEL IT WOULD BE WASTEFUL AND UNFAIR TO SUBJECT CALIFORNIANS TO EVICTIONS OR THE LOSS OF RENTAL INCOME ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN ASKED OF THEM AND DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR INCOME AT EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE IS EMINENT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO SUFFER TO LOSE THEIR HOMES OR EVEN THEIR INCOME BECAUSE OF APPLICATION PROCESSING TIMES. AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE IS GOING TO HELP US TAKE CARE OF THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS TENANTS AND LANDLORDS ALIKE WHO APPLIED TO COVERT NINETEEN EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND STILL HAVE THEIR APPLICATIONS PENDING THIS WILL pLET US MACHTE MAXIMIZE EVERY LAST EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE DOLLAR TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED EVEN AS THE PROGRAM COMES TO AN END. I DO HAVE. THANKS WILL. MISS WORK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STAFF. WE HONOR THAT CALIFORNIA WAS ALREADY FACING A HOUSING CRISIS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STARTED YEARS OF SKYROCKETING RENTS AND HOME PRICES MEANT THAT SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WAS OUT OF REACH FOR FAR TOO MANY FAMILIES AND WHEN COVERED HAD IT DIDN'T AFFECT US ALL EQUALLY. JOB LOSSES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED OUR MOST ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE RENTERS PARTICULARLY IN OUR BROWN A BLACK COMMUNITIES. IN RESPONSE THE STATE TOOK MUCH NEEDED ACTION AND I WAS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF AB THREE ZERO EIGHT EIGHT. THIS THIS BILL THE BODY AT THE- THE BILL THIS BODY PASSED IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY TO ESTABLISH EVICTION PROTECTIONS THAT ENSURE NO RENTERS LOST THEIR HOMES JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE. TO PAY RENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT FOR MANY TENANTS WHO ARE ALREADY LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK MONTHS OF MISTRUST PAYMENTS BEGIN TO ADD UP AND RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS LIKE WHY STRUGGLE TO COVER THEIR EXPENSES. OVER TIME WE'VE LIFTED PORTIONS OF THE STATE'S EVICTION PROTECTIONS AND SHIFTED OUR FOCUS TO DISTRIBUTING OVER FIVE POINT TWO BILLION RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS TO COVER MISSED RENT PAYMENTS FOR LOW INCOME TENANT HOUSEHOLDS. HOWEVER THE WORK IS NOT DONE. AS WE SPEAK HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE ARE STILL UNDER REVIEW. BUT THE PROTECTIONS THAT POSITIVE ACTIONS EVICT EVICTION CASES FOR THOSE TENANTS WILL EXPIRE THIS WEEK IF WE DO NOT ACT ON THIS BILL. UNDER AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE TENDED TO APPLIED TO RENTAL ASSISTANCE BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PROTECTIONS THROUGH JUNE OF THIS YEAR. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL PROVIDES UNIFORM STATEWIDE PROTECTIONS UNTIL JULY FIRST. WE KNOW THIS BILL ISN'T PERFECT BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN. WITHOUT THIS LEGISLATION TENANTS RISK BEING EVICTED DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY'VE APPLIED FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS. THAT WILL MAKE THEIR LANDLORDS HOLE ONCE THE APPLICATION IS PROCESS AND APPROVED. COLLEAGUES WE SIMPLY CANNOT SIT BACK AND WATCH THIS HAPPEN AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW GO TO PROPONENTS AGAIN I HAVE NEITHER SUPPORTERS NOR. OPPONENTS LISTED BUT IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MISTER CHAIRMAN DEBRA CARLTON THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WERE THE LARGEST RENTAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN THE NATION BUT I WILL WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT MOST OF OUR MEMBERS% ARE SMALL MOM AND POP OWNERS WE BELIEVE THIS IS A NARROW APPROACH WE APPRECIATE THE FACT IT'S A NARROW APPROACH ONLY PROTECTING OWNES. AND TENANTS WHO APPLIED BEFORE MARCH THIRTY FIRST AND THE CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE CAN'T HAVE DIFFERENT ALL LOCAL ORDINANCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE TAKEN A BALANCED APPROACH HERE AND WE WOULD THAT WOULD WE WOULD WE RESPECT THAT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THERE'S CURRENTLY NOBODY ELSE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU OPERATOR WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION IS THERE ANYONEHERE IN THE CHAMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED MEMBERS KATE ALLEN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION AND THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF GREATER LA- WE DO REPRESENT MOST OF THE MOM AND POPS IN THE STATE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS IN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS. AND WHAT WE DO RESPECT THAT THE BILL HAS PREEMPTION IN IT- WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FURTHER EXTENSION OF THE MORATORIUM. JUST A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS AS THE STATE HAS RE OPENED UP IN THE PANDEMIC IS REGRESSING- THERE IS NO LONGER A NEED TO EXTEND EVICTION PROTECTIONS. ANY FURTHER EXTENSION STATEWIDE EVICTION MORATORIUM WILL HURT THE MOM AND POP OWNERS MUCH MORE THAN THE CORPORATE OWNERS. AND% THERE ARE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPOTANT UNLAWFUL DETAINER EVICTION ACTIONS FILED SINCE THE LARGER PICTURE WITH MORATORIUM ENDED LAST YEAR- FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. BUT MR CHEN MEMBERS PAT MORAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL FOR THAT RASON STATED BY. THIS BILL THANK YOU. I THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. I'D SAY NINE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION. TO AB ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE AND WITH THIS POINT WE'LL TAKE NAME ASSOCIATION AND OPPOSITION ENGLAND WITH OPPOSITION CAN PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. TO ENTER THE COMIC KILL. CURRENTLY NOBODY QUEUEING UP. I THANK YOU I WILL THEN. A PRETTY MAY CLOSE LINE SO WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT PUBLISHED A BOOK. THANK YOU AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE MISTER CHAIR AUTHORS FOR THEIR WORK ON ON THIS BILL TO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS. ON LIMITATIONS OF THAT THE BILL HAS AND PROTECTING TENANTS AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE IS VERY SALUTARY IN THAT IT PROTECTS THOSE WHO HAVE SUBMITTED THEIR RENTAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION OR WHO WILL DO SO BY THE END OF THE MONTH. AND ANYBODY WHO HASN'T HEARD THIS FROM ME AT. OR FROM UC UP MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE TODAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO GET THAT APPLICATION AND BY THE END OF THE MONTH THERE'S ONLY A FEW DAYS LEFT SO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE. PEOPLE TO DO THAT- THERE ARE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE STILL WAITING ON PAYMENT- AND TO- I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE KIND OF SLOWNESS WITH WHICH THE SAP PROGRAM AS HAS HAS ROLLED OUT BUT THE- MEASURE DOESN'T PROTECT THE MILLIONS OF TENANTS WHO ARE ON THE BRINK OF RECEIVING AFFECTION NOTICES. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE RENT- AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT TO A WEEK HAD TO MISS CONNELLY FROM THE COUNTY OF LA BUT ALSO SAN FRANCISCO SAN DIEGO RICHMOND AND FRESNO HAVE ADOPTED EVICTION PROTECTIONS FOR NON PAYMENT OF RENT. THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN EFFECT ON APRIL FIRST AND THIS BILL WOULDREVERSE THOSE VOTES AND TAKE AWAY THE PROTECTIONS- THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING FOR THOUSANDS OF TENANTS- OUTSIDE OF THE ONES WHO WERE HELPING HERE TODAY. ALSO THE BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE AN EXTENSION OF THE APPLICATION FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND I FEAR THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE- BECAUSE OFFOUGHT LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES OR OTHER- ISSUES WILL NOT HAVE SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION- TENANT ADVOCACY GROUPS IN FACT HAVE NOTED THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. OF NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THE APPLICATION AND THEREFORE WILL NOT BE GETTING. RELIEF SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA CARRIED OUT. OF ALREADY AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND LOCKOUTS AND WHILE THE MEASURE IN FRONT OF US WILL HELP. OF MANY TENANTS MY CONCERN IS THAT WE WILL SEE THOUSANDS MORE LOCKOUTS AND EVICTION CASES IF NOTHING MORE IS DONE THEN THEN THIS BILL SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS. FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS I KNOW THIS IS AS FAR AS WE WERE ABLE TO GET A COMPROMISE I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. AND TO A THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME SOME TIME TO. THE BILL. OTHERS ANYONE ELSE RIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO. ECHO MY THANKS TO THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I CERTAINLY SHARE MR BLOOM'S. FRUSTRATION BUT I THINK. A BILL THAT WOULD PASS THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE MAY NOT. THE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE QUITE IS ACCEPTABLE ON THE FLOOR IN THE OTHER HOUSE AND THROUGH THE REST OF THE PROCESS I THINK WE DO NEED. TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT. WHAT I PREFERRED TO ADDRESS THE MORATORIUM DIFFERENTLY YES ABSOLUTELY AND TO PROTECT EXACTLY THOSE PEOPLE THAT MISTER BLOOM WAS TALKING ABOUT ABSOLUTELY. BUT I THINK WE OWE IT TO THOSE WHO WE CAN HELP. TO TRY AND MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD I WILL ADMIT I'M A BIT FRUSTRATED WITH. SOME OF THE PUSHBACK EVEN FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE THE THAT SYSTEM HAS NOT WORKED. THE WAY THAT IT COULD HAVE WORKED AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE ARE HERE TODAY WITH WITH THIS EXTENSION IN THE FORM THAT IT SAID AND I KNOW EACH OF US IN OUR OFFICES ARE GETTING A LOT OF CALLS FROM LANDLORDS AND FROM TENANTS. WHO ARE BOTH VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS HOW IT'S ROLLING OUT AND LOOKING FOR THOSE PROTECTIONS. SO. WITH THAT MEMBERS YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND THE COMMON ALSO OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBER- AS WELL AND- IT IS RIGHT THE OBSERVATION IS RIGHT THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL AND IT IS FRUSTRATING AT THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO FACE AND BEAR THAT ARE IN PERFECT BUT AS CLOSE AS A COMPROMISE AS WE CAN GET AS CLOSE AS WE CAN GET IN PROTECTIONS- WE GOT THERE AND SO HERE WE ARE TODAY- WITH THIS BILL THAT WE DO NOW- WILL HELP HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OF RUNNERS THAT ARE ON THE BRINK OF EVICTION SO WITH THAT WE MUST TAKE ACTION AND TO THE CHAIR OF MY JOINT OTHER MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO CLOSE THE CASE I WANT TO THANK MR BLOOM'S COMMENTS I ECHO SOME OF THOSE AND- SENTIMENTS AND MISTER CHAIR AS WELL- IN OTHER PARTS OF THIS BILL I DON'T LIKE EITHER- AND THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO MORE FOR THOSE LIVING ON THE BRINK THOSE THAT ARE WRITTEN BURDENS WHICH REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS POPULATION PRIOR TO COVER DURING COVERT AFTER COVERED- THERE'S A LOT OF POLICY WORK HAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TOWARDS THAT END AND HOUSING WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TOWARDS THAT END- FOR A LONG TIME TO COME. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL- BUT MY JOIN AUTHOR AND OTHERS ON THE DICE HERE- TOWARDS THAT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS DEADLINE IS COMING UP WE HAVE TO EXTEND THIS WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE CAN HELP RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW- WHICH IS WHY I'M DOING AUTHORED THIS BILL NEXT.
