COLLEAGUES IF YOU WOULD PLEASE GIVE ATTENTION TO THE BACK OF THE CHAMBER TO SENATOR DODD BEN SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL TEN NINETY NINE BY SENATOR DODD AN ACT RELATING TO NON VEHICULAR AIR POLLUTION SENATOR DODD THE FLORIDA SENATE PRESIDENT MEMBERS I'M GLAD TO BE LEADING OFF TODAY AND- FIRST OF A- SEVENTY BILLS SB TEN NINETY NINE PROTECTS CRITICAL FACILITIES ABILITIES. TO OPERATE EMERGENCY BACKUP GENERATORS DURING PUBLIC'S. SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF OR OTHER LOSS OF POWER LIKE A WILDFIRE. CRITICAL FACILITIES LIKE WATER-WASTE WATER AGENCIES AND HOSPITALS NEED RELIABLE POWER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH PS PSE BEDS WITH. THESE FACILITIES MUCH USE THEIR EMERGENCY BACKUP GENERATORS TO DELIVER SAFE WATER AND PROVIDE LIFESAVING SERVICES HOWEVER THERE ARE LIMITATIONS IN CERTAIN THEIR DISTRICTS THAT RESTRICT THE RUN TIME OF THESE GENERATORS EVEN DURING EMERGENCIES. SB TEN NINETY NINE ADDS TO EXISTING PROCESS SAID AIR DISTRICTS CALLED A STIPULATED ORDER OF ABATEMENT IT REQUIRES THE AIR DISTRICTS TO DEVELOP SPECIAL STIPULATION THAT ALLOWS AN OPERATOR CRITICAL FACILITY TO RUN THEIR EMERGENCY BACKUP GENERATORS DURING A P. S. P. S. EVE THAT. EVEN IF THEY EXCEED THE TIME LIMITS. IT EXCEEDS OPERATOR FOR WORK WITH THE DISTRICTS ON A REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE FOR THEIR OLDER GENERATORS WHICH IMPORTANTLY MUST BE TECHNICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE A CONSIDER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE EXISTING EMERGENCY BACKUP GENERATOR. THESE SO WAYS ARE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES BEFORE ANYBODY ELATION RATHER THAN HAVING THE OPERATORS OF CRITICAL FACILITIES UP THAT. APPLY FOR A VERY IT'S AFTER THE FACT. THE VARIANCE PROCESS STILL REMAINS AN OPTION YES- WEIGHTS ARE JUST ONE VOLUNTARY TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THE ALLOWS OPERATORS TO OPERATE THE BACKUP GENERATORS DURING A PSP US OR WHILE FAR WITHOUT FEAR OF FINES OR PENALTIES. SB TEN NINETY NINE PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR BOTH- DISTRICTS AND OPERATORS OF CRITICAL FACILITIES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MOVING TOWARD CLEANER TECHNOLOGY AND PROTECTING YOUR QUALITY. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY TALKING TO THE OPPOSITION IN ANY PARTY IS- THAT HAVE COME FORWARD WITH CONCERNS IT'S SEEKING WAYS WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT APPROACH THAT WORKS FOR ONE. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD IS THERE ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR ALLEN. FULL PAGE. YES OF I KNOW THE EVEN IN THE SAME MANNER WITHOUT SENATOR ALLEN IF YOU WOULD WAIT JUST SECOND COULD WE PLEASE HAVE HIS MIKE. HE DOES NOT ADDRESS AND I WAS LARGELY ASKING A QUESTION ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUE IS NOW HERE FROM THOUSAND OAKS AND SO- I'M SURE HE- WOULD PREFER TO ASK THE QUESTION. WELL HE'S GETTING READY MADAM CHAIR JUST ONE FINAL COMMENT I APOLOGIZE CENTER GLAZER THE GOD PRINCIPLE CALL AUTHOR ON THIS BILL IN ITS HAVE TO TRY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BILLS. I HE HAD ONE BILL THAT WAS IN THIS AREA FOR A HOSPITALS I HAD A BILL FOR CRITICAL FACILITIES LIKE WATER DISTRICTS AND SO WE MERGE THOSE TWO TOGETHER IN A TAPPED TO HAVE FEWER BILLS ON THE FLOOR SO. THANK YOU TO. GOOD SENATOR FROM AROUND THE- THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION SENATOR AND NOW WE WILL MOVE WE'LL START WITH SENATOR STERN. UNDER DEBATE AND DISCUSSION YES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST WANT-TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR THEIR HARD WORK IN DIGGING IN ON. THIS POWER SHUT OFF ISSUE AND REALLY ADDRESSING AT- A GAP IN OUR IN OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM IF WE LOSE WATER DURING THESE. THESE INCIDENTS- WE LOSE EVERYTHING WE CAN'T FIGHT FIRES AND- SOCIETY STARTS TO SLOWLY BREAK DOWN SO I APPRECIATE THE URGENCY OF THIS AND I THINK THE QUESTION I HAVE THE AUTHOR WAS REALLY. I KNOW THERE'S SOME ISSUES AROUND- AT THE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S AND THEIR CONCERNS OF MY CONCERN WAS PRIMARILY THAT. IN THE SPACE OF WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE USED HERE AND REALLY TO PUSH THE WATER DISTRICTS TO ADOPT THE CLEANEST ALTERNATIVES FEASIBLE AND I KNOW YOU'VE LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE AND GOING THROUGH SOME THINKING THERE SO I JUST WANTED TO POSE A QUESTION AND ASK- IF THE BILL IS WHEN CLOSER TO THE ASSEMBLY OF THERE'S AN INTENT TO- REQUIRE AT LEAST THESE WATER DISTRICTS TO DO SOME HOMEWORK AND JUST USE. THAT ALL THE BILLABLE THING AT THE ADOPT CLEANER ALTER ISN'T JUST DEFAULTING TO DIS SENATORS AT A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR YES WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUEST YES THANK. YOU ANY INSTITUTION PUTTING IN- ANY TYPE OF GENERATORS TODAY SHOULD DO THE DUE DILIGENCE. AND DO THE WORK NECESSARY TO DETERMINE. WHAT KIND OF CO TWO IS BEING OMITTED FROM THERE SO- UTILIZING- THE- CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES AS IS ALWAYS THE WAY TO GO SO YES THAT. THE ON THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS NOT THE ANYTHING THAT WE WOULD OPPOSE THE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION I THINK THAT THIS BILL ALREADY GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY- IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE JUST IT IT IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THAT. AND HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT. THIS IS. TO LOOK AT IT I JUST I HATE TO BE A STICK BURNER BROUGHT UP WITH THE SENATOR FROM VENTURA COUNTY ON HER BACK UP GENERATOR BILL AND- WITH THE SENATE FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND- I JUST DON'T WANT IS DEFAULTING TO DIESEL WE'RE GONNA SOLVE PS PS THIS FIRE SEASON ALMOST WITH A 100% DIESEL POWER IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA AND I DON'T THINK. THAT'S NOT REALLY A TRUE CALIFORNIA SOLUTION SO JUST. I HATE TO BE A STICKLER BUT- THEY OPEN THIS TO ADOPTING A REQUIREMENT TO DO THAT DILIGENCE BEFORE- OPTING INTO THIS AIR QUALITY EXEMPTION. I DON'T HAVE ANY BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE WITH. WITH MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION I WANT TO BRING EVERYBODY BACK TO THAT. THE REASON FOR THE BILL. THE REASON FOR THE BILL IN THE FIRST PLACE. IS BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING THESE PSP **** AND- IN MANY CASES BECAUSE THE P. S. P. S. IS OUR LONGER THEY MAY EXCEED THE NUMBER OF HOURS. THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO RUN THEIR GENERATORS FROM. AND FROM THE FROM THE AIRPORT AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS JUST. LOOK AT THESE PS PS IS ARE THESE CRITICAL FACILITIES FAULT. WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET YOU KNOW SOME SOME WAVE PATHWAY FORWARD ONE OF THE REASONS I TOOK A FIVE YEAR SUNSET ON THIS BILL. IT'S BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK SHOULD BE OPEN ENDED AND BECAUSE OF THAT QUALITY ISSUES. RENEW ENERGY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE WE DIDN'T THINK IT SHOULD BE A LONG TERM SURE THE- SITUATION WHERE THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO USE. YOU KNOW WHO DIRTY IF YOU WILL DIESEL- YELLOW GENERATORS. SO HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION ON THIS IF YOU WANT. A SPECIFIC- YOU KNOW LIKE WHICH I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE- CRITICAL FACILITIES WOULD HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE I AS I SAID AT THE ONSET- THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERING THAT ANYWAY. OKAY THANK YOU FOR INDULGING THE QUESTION A AND MY SENSE IS IF THAT AMANDA WERE ADOPTED- THEY'RE ALL ENVIRONMENTAL OPPOSITION BE DROPPED AND WE CAN MOVE FOR SO APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING ON THAT I THINK. WILL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE WITH THAT COMMITMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR GROW FOLLOWED BY SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND QUESTION THE AUTHOR BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE GET THESE BILLS AND WE JUST HAVE A BRIEF TIME TO GO OVER AND- WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION AUTHOR YES WOULD YOU ACCEPT QUESTIONS VERY GOOD CENTER GROW PLEASING. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND THEN I GOT A LITTLE CONFUSED WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION UNDER PS PSP EMERGENCY SHUT OFF FOR FIRES WERE PEOPLE HAVE N POWER IN THE WINTER TO KEEP THEIR HOMES WARM OR NO FACILITIES OR- COMPANIES THAT HAVE THE POWER TO KEEP- TO HAVE THE GENERATED POWER BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY SHUT OFF LIKE IT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. WERE MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FOR HANNAH BARBARA MADE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT A GENERATORS WERE ALLOWED IT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AFTER REQUIRED YOUR BILL JUST SAYS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO WORK. WITH NINE THREE THE PSP. BUT ONLY FOR SHORT OF TIME FIVE YEARS THAT THEY CAN APPLY FOR THOSE GRANTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THOUSAND OAKS. HAD MENTIONED DURING THE CONTENT OF THE DISCUSSION WITH MY COLLEAGUES BILL FRIEND. A SANTA BARBARA SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IS ONLY TO ALLOW THESE GENERATORS TO OPERATE TO PROVIDE POWER TO PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT. LIKE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES DURING AN EMERGENCY STATE SHUT OFF. AND DURING THAT EMERGENCY STATE SHUT OFF THEY WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO USE THE GENERATORS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. BEFORE THEY CAN REPLACE THEM WITH THE GRANTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR ENERGY AND YOU KNOW OTHER KIND OF- GENERATING POWER IS THAT RIGHT OR WRONG. I WOULD SAY THAT THE SENATOR FROM BAKERSFIELD WAS MUCH MORE ARTICULATE THE DIE WAS- ON THE DESCRIPTION OF THAT BILL AND I THANK HER VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU I'M ON MY OWN TIME. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WITH WHAT WE FACING CALIFORNIA WITH THESE PS PS SITUATIONS YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR AND ALL AROUND THE STATE NOT JUST IN MY DISTRICT FROM SOUTHERN. TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WITH SMALL COMMUNITY TO HAVE TO BE THE EXPERIENCE PS PS ADVANCE. AND IT'S AN ELDERLY RETIEMENT COMMUNITY IT REALLY IS A MOUNTAIN RETIREMENT COMMUNITY PEOPLE COME FROM LOS ANGELES FROM ALL OVER TO RETIRE TO THIS BEAUTIFUL COMMUNITY. THAT HAS FOUR SEASONS AT REAL FOUR SEASONS SUMMER WINTER SPRING AND FALL IT'S GOT BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS. ONE OF MOST. AMAZING SPRING DID UP ON THEM SPRING FLOWERS ON THE MOUNTAIN TOPS IT'S GOT SNOW IN THE WINTER IT'S GOT BEAUTIFUL FOLLIES. JUST REALLY LETTUCE COMMUNITY. OUT OF POWER I BELIEVE FOR TWENTY THREE DAYS. TWENTY THREE DAYS- THE WAIT WHAT WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT WENT DOWN IT BECAUSE BACK UP IN THE TOWN THERE WAS ALL THIS. ISSUE IT TOOK PLACE AND IF. WE WERE ABLE TO RUN BACK AND GENERATORS WITHOUT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD FINING AS- IT'S UNGODLY THINK THE EVEN. UPON ME. UPON MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THOSE PEOPLE COULD'VE BEEN TAKING CARE OF IN A MUCH BETTER WAY. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON THE LIMITED INFORMATION THAT I HAVE THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT ALLOWS BACKUP GENERATORS TO RESPOND. TO MATCH NEEDED POWER SOURCES THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE DURING A PS PS. AND THEY WILL NOT BE FINE BY THE CALIFORNIA- RESOURCES BOARD EVEN IF THEY HAVE A PROTECT WHICH MEANS PER YOU KNOW THAT. IT'S A PORTABLE TAG A PORTABLE GENERATOR TAG. SO I. APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR DOING THAT. OF MY BLOOD THE OTHER FROM FOR PUTTING A FIVE YEAR SUNSET ON IT BECAUSE THAT LLOWS THESE INDUSTRIES. THESE PEOPLE THAT USE THESE- PORTABLE GENERATORS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE FIVE YEARS TO GARNER OTHER. MEANS OF POWER. AND TECHNOLOGY THAT IS STARTING TO BECOME AVAILABLE I THINK IT'S A WELL THOUGHT OUT BILL. AND JUST THINK GATHERED FOR PRISON ANY CLEAR I MADE MY- THANK YOU. HIS TO GROW SENATOR WE. THANK YOU I'M NOT PRESIDENT IF I COULD JUST. PUT TO BE ON PLEASE. I WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION CENTER DOT. WITHOUT OF TO THE QUESTION TO GO CLARIFY THE IN THE SAN FROM FROM LOS ANGELES CAL. QUESTION LANDIS IS THAT THE SENATOR. HAS PROPOSED SOME SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS. AND THE IDEAS OF THOSE WOULD BE TAKEN- IN THE ASSEMBLY- TO REQUIRE CONSIDERATION. OF THE CLEANER ENERGY SO THAT WE DON'T TO FALL TO THE DIRTY ENERGY- ARE YOU ARE YOU PREPARED TO TAKE THOSE IN THE ASSEMBLY. IT'S JUST THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE OPERATOR TAKE A DEMONSTRABLE STEPS SUCH AS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR REQUEST FOR. PROPOSAL TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING THE USE OF BACK UP. POWER TECHNOLOGIES THAT MEET OR EXCEED EMISSION STANDARDS. A BY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT AMENDED. BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR FOR THOSE THAT PERHAPS MIGHT NOT LIKE THAT. BUT THAT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT TO DO SO I JUST IT'S A IT'S A MIDDLE GROUND HERE. IN AND- HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WILL SEE IT ISTHAT THANK YOU CENTER OUR OUR THANK YOU ON SO MANY PRESIDENT ARMS I THINK A NUMBER OF US HAD. CONCERNS ABOUT HIS BILL THAT IT WOULD BE A DEFAULT. FIVE TWO GENERATORS PROPANE OR DIESEL- AND TING WITH THESE AMENDMENTS- IT WILL- FROM ALL RIGHT TO HERS AND NOT FOR THE DIRTY ENERGIES AND TO TRY TO CLEAN ENERGY. OBVIOUSLY WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. OUR I WAS THE RIGHT BALANCE AND SO ON BASED ON ASSURING I'LL BE VOTE ON IT TO THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER ANY FURTHER TO DISK CHEN OUT. MEMBERS THERE WE GO HI I WANTED THINK FRIENDS FROM THOUSAND OAKS AND MY CALL FROM SERVICES GO- FOR WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS I THINK THESE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING WILL WILL CERTAINLY STRENGTH IN THE BILL MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT HARMING THE AIR MIGHT MY ONLY RESPONSE TODAY THE COMMENTS ARE MARKET. ALI FROM BAKERSFIELD IS THAT. IN THERE WE DID IT WE DID A DEEP DIVE INTO THIS ONE THIS MEASURE CAME BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE AND THERE HAVE BEEN. NO INCIDENCES OF. HIGHER BOARDS FINING. HAVE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO KEEP THE POWER ON DURING. YES YES INCIDENCES. AND YOU KNOW IT IN THE IN THE- IN THE IN THE IN THE TYPES OF SITUATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP. THEY WERE TRYING TO IT ALLEVIATE AND AN ADDRESS AND WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL. THE AIRPORTS OF SAID IT VERY CLEARLY THAT THEY WOULDN'T FIND UNDER THOSE KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND. THE DIFFICULTIES AND THE- THE- THE- THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE TS TS. LET'S NOT LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES THERE'S A LOT OF POLLUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIESEL GENERATORS. AND IF ANYTHING. THE PROBLEM HERE THAT WE'VE GOT A UTILITY. THAT HAS NOT DONE THE WORK HAS NOT PUT IN PLACE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO MITIGATE AND TO MINIMIZE THE NEED FOR P. S. TS ADVANCE. AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE HOSPITALS IN TOWNS LIKE THAT BEAUTIFUL TOWN THAT THE SENATOR TALKED ABOUT UP IN THE MOUNTAINS THAT ARE FORCED TO GO TO HEAVILY POLLUTING DIESEL GENERATORS THAT POWER AARON MIGHT MAKE THAT LITTLE TOWN A LITTLE LESS PRETTY THAN IT WAS BEFORE AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE UTILITIES HAVE. HI FAILED. TO DO ITS JOB AND IS RESULT THEY HAVE THESE MASSIVE POWER SET US ALL THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT RESULT IN THE NEED FOR FOLKS TO POWER AND DIESEL POLLUTING DIESEL GENERATORS AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE HEART OF THIS PROBLEM HERE. AND WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO THIS BILL TO CRAFTING A COMPROMISE TO ALLOW. HOSPITALS AND OTHER VITAL INSTITUTIONS TO KEEP. RUNNING DURING DIFFICULT TIMES HOW WE WANT TO ALLOW THE NETFLIX ABILITY- BUT LET'S NOT MAKEANY MISTAKE ABOUT WHAT. WHO WHO THE REAL- VILLIAN IS HERE. AND LET'S ALSO NOT MAKING A MISTAKE THAT. THESE DIESEL GENERATORS ARE HEAVILY POLLUTED. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN SENATOR DOLLY AB. TO GET THAT MIKE PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TO I WAS ANY Q. AS WELL WHEN HIS BILL CAME THROUGH AND ACTUALLY VOTED AGAINST THIS BILL NOT BECAUSE- I THINK IT WE WENT. I'M I'M WORRIED WE'RE GONNA GO TOO FAR LOOK. THIS IS THE CHAIR OF THE EQ BROUGHT UP SOME REALLY GREAT POINTS. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT HOSPITALS AND WATER DISTRICTS. THEY DIDN'T CAUSE THIS PROBLEM UNIQUE BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM BUT I HAVE IN OUR IN OUR DISTRICT WE'VE HAD. OUTAGES FOR. TEN TO TWELVE DAYS AND EVEN LONGER IN SOME AREAS OF THE DISTRICT WHERE THEY WERE REQUIRED TO RUN THOSE. GENERATORS TO PROVIDE. OUR OR WATER INTO HAVE DEEPER HOSPITAL RUNNING. THIS BILL COULD ALLOW THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL IS TO COME IN AND FORCE THEM TO BECAUSE THEY'RE RUNNING LONGER PRISON THEY NORMALLY WOULD RUN AND THERE IS A PULL BLOOM. ASSOCIATE WITH THE- SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A HOSPITAL. THAT IS IN THAT SITUATION AND AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICER COMES IN AND MANDATE YOU CHANGED OUT BECAUSE YOU'RE POLLUTANTS. AND THESE ARE DISTRICT HOSPITALS WE ACTUALLY ASSESS OURSELVES TO PROPERTY TAX SO WE CAN HAVE A HOSPITAL. THAT COULD BE TWO TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THAT DISTRICT HOSPITAL. THAT IS NOT THEIR FAULT. SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT GOING TOO FAR THE OTHER WAY I VOTED AGAINST THE BILL I'M GONNA LAY OFF ON THE BILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE. THE AUTHORS TRYING TO STRIKE BOTH AUTHORS I SHOULD SAY ARE TRYING TO STRIKE THE BALANCE WHERE. LOOK IF THERE'S AN ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE THEY SHOULD DO IT. IF THERE IS A HARDSHIP AND THERE IS NOT THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO IT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GENERATE AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS SO. I'M OPTIMIST LEE WATCHING THE BILL HOPEFULLY THE AMENDMENTS TO COME BACK. THAT THE AUTHORS AGREED TO TAKE WILL WILL STRIKETHAT BALANCE SO THAT ALL COMMUNITIES CAN FINANCIALLY GET WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND WE CAN ALSO HAVE. BETTER ENVIRONMENT THE SAME TIME SO I WANT TO APPLAUD THE ALL THESE WE HE HAS. WORKED US BILL VERY HARD AND I'M HOPING IT'LL GET OUT AND THAT THE MINUTES WILL BE. WILL BE FAIR TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA STATE YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SIX BATES BUT MAY I ASK MAY I ASK IT'S REALLY HARD TO SEE WHO'S GOT THEIR MIKE SHOP.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. TOP POWER IF POWER IS LIFE WE THINK ABOUT POWER WE SAY IF THE LIGHTS ON IN THE ROOM BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE POWER REALLY IS LIFE. WHEN THE POWERSHOT OFFICE IT WAS THIS PAST FALL IT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF OF ANTS. OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE LOST THEIR POWER IN CALIFORNIA. THE CAMPUS THE MORE THAN FORTY COUNTIES. AND WITHIN THOSE COUNTIES. THERE ARE THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE BASS LINE MEDICAL CUSTOMERS TO. FOR THEM POWER IS LIFE. BUT WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT. THEY'RE IN A VERY. MORE THAN I'M COMFORTABLE THERE IN A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION SO SB EIGHT A ONE IS A BILL TO TRY TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS OF OUR STATE. WHEN WE ENTER THE WILDFIRE SEASON WHICH IS COMING SOONER IN SOONER WHEN THE POWER GETS SHUT OFF THROUGH WITH NO CONTROL OF ANYONE EXCEPT FOR THE UTILITY COMPANIES AND NATURE. AND THE QUESTION IS CAN THOSE PEOPLE GET BACK UP POWER TO PROTECT THEIR LIVES. AND FOR THEM IT'S NOT BACK UP POWER TO. RUN THE XBOX ON THE TV ENTERTAINMENT IS NOT POWER TO RUN EVEN THE REFRIGERATOR THE FREEZER AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GREAT GREAT ECONOMIC IMPACT WHEN THE POWER GOES OFF. ON THE REFRIGERATION UNIT FOR THEM THE POWER IS LIFE IF YOU'RE ON A DIALYSIS MACHINE POWER IS LIFE. IF YOU HAVE A BREATHING MACHINE. OUR IS LIFE A RESPIRATOR AND IRON LONG. THAT POWER IS EVERYTHING IN YOUR WORLD. THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T SAY THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE TO PROVIDE POWER FOR EVERYTHING IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD IT SAYS THAT FOR THOSE WHO ARE MEDICAL BASELINE DOCTOR APPROVED MEDICAL BASELINE FOR POWER IS LIFE THAT THE UTILITY NEEDS TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF ENERGY SOURCE. TO KEEP YOU ALIVE AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF EIGHT OH ONE AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR WILK FOLLOWED BY SENATOR NIELSEN.

IF THEY DO NOT MAKE THEIR LEGAL DUTIES EMPLOYEES OF THAT BARGAINING UNIT CAN FILE CHARGES AGAINST THE ORGANIZATION. DESPITE THIS SOME PUBLIC EMPLOYERS STILL CHOOSE TO IGNORE THEIR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. OR SOME EMPLOYERS AND INACCURATE OR OUT OF DATE INFORMATION. SINCE THE MAY TWENTY TWENTY REPORTING DEADLINE AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR EMPLOYERS FAILED TO EVEN RESPOND TO THE BARGAINING AGENT WITH NO CONSEQUENCES. THIS BILL SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES WITH PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EMPLOYER TO CURE THE PROBLEM AND RESPOND. WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AT HERE TO EXISTING LAW. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THOSE SAME EMPLOYERS HAVE TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION THEY HAVE IT ON LISTS. HAVE TO HAVE BASIC INFORMATION LIKE THE NAMES OF THEIR EMPLOYEES WHERE THEY WORK WITH CLASSIFICATION THEY WORK AND- LET ME BE CLEAR THAT THIS MEASURE CREATES KNOLL NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. IT SIMPLY INCENTIVIZE IS COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAW. DURING EMERGENCIES HAVING ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION IS ESSENTIAL WHETHER THE STATE IS FACING WILDFIRES MASS SHOOTINGS OR PANDEMIC VIRUSES CALIFORNIA EXPECTS ITS PUBLIC SERVANTS TO CONTINUE TO SERVE. THE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE HAS THE MORAL AND A LEGAL DUTY TO WATCH OUT FOR THE WELFARE OF THESE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WHO TURK WINTER AND WATCH OUT FOR THE PUBLIC'S WELLBEING. SHORTAGES AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT HAVE LEFT MANY FRONTLINE WORKERS EXPOSED WELL-SERVING THE PUBLIC. THOSE ARE BARGAINING AGENTS HAVE BOND THEMSELVES PROCURING PP TO KEEP EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC SAFE WHERE THE PUBLIC EMPLOYERS LACTOSE SOURCES TO DETERMINE THE P. B. E. NEEDS AN ORGANIZATION THAT UP TODAY CON INFORMATION AND WORKS LOOK. OF THE BARGAINING UNIT. THIS CRISIS HAS SHOWN IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ENTIRE BARGAINING UNIT AND SURE WORKPLACE SAFETY FOR THESE REASONS COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE BEFORE YOU. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IDOL. THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL DEBATER DISCUSSION DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR ALAN. MEMBERS LIKE I SUPPORT THE BROAD GOALS OF THIS BILL AND IT'S ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAW- THE AUTHOR AND I'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS MIGHT MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT THE CURRENT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE OF PUBLIC AGENCIES REALLY DOES SEEM PRETTY HIGH TO ME AT THE CURVE IN SOME HI I'M HOPING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM THERE ABOUT- ABOUT SIGNIFICANTLY DROPPING THAT NUMBER LET US REMEMBER THIS IS TAXPAYER DOLLARS AT PLAY HERE WE OBVIOUSLY WANT THEM TO COMPLY. AND WE ALSO TO MAKE SURE THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE. ARE GOING TO THE USES THAT TAXPAYERS WANTED TO GO SEE WHICH IS FINDING THE VERY SERVICES THAT THESE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE. PROVIDING SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION YES WITHOUT OBJECTION PLEASE PROCEED NGUYEN AND PRIVATE BUSINESSES ARE FIND- THE MONEY THAT IS GENERATED FROM THE PRIVATE BUSINESS GOES BACK TO THE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF A DESPERATELY. OR THE CHANCE. A WIN THESE ARE FINE WHICH IS TAXPAYER DOLLARS- FOR MUNICIPALITIES OR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WEIRD IS THAT MANY GO IS IT JUST FIND IN PAID AND PUT BACK INTO THE GENERAL FUND OR DOES IT THIS BILL PROVIDES FOR IT TO GO SOMEPLACE ELSE. MAYOR ANSWER. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION PLEASE. YES THE MONEY WILL BE VOTE ARE GIVEN TO THE PROBE GENERAL FUND. AND I'M SORRY THE MONEY WILL GO TO THE GENERAL FUND. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY I'M ON MY OWN TIME JUST TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND IT'S JUST SO I UNDERSTAND BILL AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BILL. IT IS- A PUBLIC ENTITY BUT SAVE. THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT THE AT T. DOES NOT PROVIDE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT THE PROPER INFORMATION AT THE PROPER TIME THE EDT IS GOING TO BE FINE. FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY FOR SO MANY DAYS IT'S CALLED A HUNDRED DAYS. THAT TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT THE STATE IS GOING TO PAY. ON BEHALF OF THE U. D. D. WE'LL GO BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND WHERE IT CAME FROM TO WRITE THE CHECK. THE FIRST PLACE I GUESS AM I RIGHT OR WRONG STE SENATOR DORADO DO YOU WISH TO RESPOND YES- FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC- PENALTY THAT'S DONE AT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WELL WHAT WE AMENDED IN THIS. THERE MAY BE SOME EMPLOYERS WHO MADE THE MISTAKE WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION THE WHOLE GOAL IS TO JUST GET ATTENTION FROM THESE ENTITIES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING THE LIST TO THE BARGAINING AGENT IT'S NOT TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF IT IT'S NOT TO LINE ANYBODY'S POCKETS IT'S JUST TO GET THEIR ATTENTION. SO THEY'RE GIVEN A CURE SO THAT THEY COULD FIX THE PROBLEM. OBVIOUSLY IF IT CONTINUES- THEN- THE BARGAINING AGENT WOULD GO BACK TO PER- I THINK IT YOU KNOW UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY WOULD- TO LOOK AT THE THIS THE ACTUAL A PROBLEM SEE HOW SERIOUS IT WAS IS IT REPETITIVE WHATEVER IT IS AND THEY HAVE THE OPTION ON THE DISCRETION OF FINDING THAT ENTITY THAT ENTITY OF THE FINE WOULD GO TO THE PURPOSE A GENERAL FUND NOT THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND. SOME THE QUESTION SEVEN ON MY OWN TIME SO- BASED ON THE UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE JUST ANSWERED. AND I YOU KNOW I WANT TO SAY WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER BECAUSE I MEAN A PRIVATE BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE FIND AT HER IN THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY. FIND OUT WHAT THE STATE BE FINE TOO. BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IT MAKES NO SENSE. BUSINESSES FIND UNDER THE SAME RULES WHICH THEY ARE FOR NOT COMPLYING WITH. THE GET A CURE. SO THIS IS LIKE A GENEROUS BILL TO THE- IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE FINE. AND IN THE NOT MANY GOES BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND. AND YOU KNOW ISUSED FOR. YOU KNOW WHATEVER WE DECIDE TO SPEND MONEY ON. BUT YET THIS BILL. GOING TO REQUIRE THE GENERAL FUND TO WRITE A CHECK WHICH IS GOING TO BE RETURNED TO THE GENERAL FUND. FOR A FINE GENERAL FRIEND HAD TO PAY. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL UNLESS THIS THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL PUTS THAT MANY SOMEPLACE ELSE IN A UNION ORGANIZATION OR A- PENSION FUNDING SENIOR. OR SEVENTEEN THAT. IT JUST INCREASES COSTS TO TAXPAYERS FOR THOSE. OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES I'M ASSUMING- BUT TO PASS A BILL THAT REQUIRES THE GENERAL FUND TO WRITE A CHECK OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND TO GET MONEY BACK INTO THE GENERAL FUND. FOR A PENALTY THAT WAS VIOLATED BY AN AGENCY OR MUNICIPALITY- MAKES NO SENSE TO ME AND I WOULD ASK TO- SAY NO TO THIS BILL AND THEN REPEAT THE PROCESS AND WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND THEN MOVE FORWARD- THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR PLEASE WOULD YOU ACCEPT A QUESTION FROM SENATOR BORCHERT'S YES. CENTER BORDERS PLEASE PROCEED WHAT IS THE EXISTING ADMINISTRATIVE- PRACTICE FOR- BARGAINING UNIT TO. WORK WITH A PUBLIC ENTITY TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES NAMELY. NEW EMPLOYEES. WHAT IS THE EXISTING REMEDY ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY. THAT EXIST GET THAT INFORMATION AND IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. WHAT OCCURRED RIGHT NOW. THE FILE A CHARGE WITH HERB. AND THEN A GOES THROUGH WHATEVER THE PER PROCESSES. SO THE LABOR BOARD WILL WERE STILL RECEIVE THE CHARGE YES WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ADDS DOLLAR AMOUNT TO THAT. YES AND THE BRING IT BRINGS ATTENTION BECAUSE IT WILL BE SPECIFICALLY OUTLINED THAT THERE'S A PROCESS FOR THEM. HERB TO REACH OUT TO THAT ENTITY TO THAT JURISDICTION AND SAY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE YOU'VE GOT TO FIX THIS PROBLEM GOT IT I THINK ON ITS FACE YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S HAVING ENFORCEMENT. IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS CAN SENATE WHAT I'VE NOTICED HELLO. IS THAT PER CHARGES. AND PENALTIES THAT ARE ATTACHED MAYBE NOT COLLECTED. BUT SUED AND EVEN ARE ADJUDICATED IN FAVOR OF ONE PARTY ARGUES LARGELY FOR PR-PURPOSES AND TO INCREASE LEVERAGING POWER NGUYEN RENEGOTIATION OCCURS DURING THE CYCLE FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE IS A DAY OR TWO LATE CHARGES ARE FILED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE LEVIED REGARDLESS IF IT GOES BACK TO THE STATE OR- THAT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE. FATHER'S LITERATURE THEY GETS ELATED POSITION PIECES THAT GET CIRCULATED THAT SAY- COUNTY TAX FOR STATE EX HAS FAILED IT'S- WORKING POPULATION BECAUSE- THEY'RE VIOLATING ALL THESE LABOR RULES SO WE CREATES THIS IN INFLAMMATORY ENVIRONMENT. THAT GIVES THE WRONG IMPRESSION TO PEOPLE THAT REALIZE CITY CALIFORNIA'S BEEN FIND NUMBER DOLLAR FAILING TO ABIDE BY LABOR PRACTICES SO I'M IF WE ALREADY KNOW THE MONEY'S GOING BACK INTO THE SYSTEM WE ALREADY KNOW THERE'S ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT PROVIDE THAT CHECK. I'M CURIOUS THIS HAS MORE OF A P. R. COMPONENT IN A REAL FORCE COMPONENT. THE YOU SENATOR BORJA NOW SENATOR MULLIN AND GROWS.

THIRTY THIRTY ONE THIRTY TWO THIRTY THREE AND THIRTY FOUR. SENATOR ROSS SO EUROPE NOW WITH FILE ITEM THIRTY. BEN CHECK JERRY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINETY BY SENATOR DORADO AN ACT RELATING TO TENNESSEE SENATOR TO RUSSELL. COLLEAGUES GIVEN THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS CAUSED BY THE CLOVER NINETEEN CRISIS THE STATE THE STATE IS FOCUSING WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS VERY MUCH ON KEEPING CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR HOMES. WHETHER TO OUR PRO TEM'S HOUSING PRODUCTION WORKING GROUP OR OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL THE OUT TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE. BILL IS BI WHEN CLOSEST TO OF TENANT STABILIZATION SPECIALLY NEEDED IN THIS CRISIS. FIRST KEVIN STABILIZATION PROVISIONS FOR TENANTS EXPERIENCING THE MOST VULNERABLE CIRCLE AND THAT IS. BEING A VICTIM OF A VIOLENT CRIME. UNFORTUNATELY WE KNOW THAT NOT EVERY HOME IS SAFE. THE WORLD HAS SEEN HOW THE COLBERT NINETEEN SHELTER IN PLACE PROTECTIONS HAVE LED TO AN INCREASE IN INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE VICTIMS BY LIVE WITH OR NEAR THEIR PERPETRATORS. CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW INSURERS THAT VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FAMILY MAY ELEVENTH. IN THE HOUSEHOLD CAN TERMINATE A LEASE WITHOUT PENALTY FOLLOWING THE VICTIMIZATION. MY BILL WOULD INCLUDE VICTIMS OF OTHER VIOLENT CRIMES LIKE GUN VIOLENCE ARMED HOME INVASION OR CALL VICTIMS OF HOMICIDE. THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIMES AND THEIR FAMILY HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO TERMINATE THE LEASE WITHOUT PENALTY. THIS BILL ARE EXTENDS THE PROVISIONS TO MEET ITALIAN FAMILY MEMBERS OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSEHOLD. I% WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS TEN AND STABILIZATION PROVISION HAS AN EXISTING RIGOROUS CERTIFICATION AND DOCUMENTATION PROJECT UP PROCESS. ARE YOU DO TO SUPPORT OUR OWN BACK OUT OF CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFE IN JUST AS A WORKED VERY VERY HARD TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES FOR VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS. WELL BEFORE AND AFTER HELLO BUT NINETEEN. HIGHER DUE TO SUPPORT THE HOW THE SECURITY OF TENANTS EXPERIENCING THE MOST VULNERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. SECOND I AM PROPOSING LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF TENANTS STABILIZATION PROVISIONS I WANT TO NOTE THAT IN THIS BILL LOCAL ENFORCEMENT IS PERMISSIVE NOT MANDATORY. LAST YEAR OF E APPROVED AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICHCODIFIED JUST BECAUSE PROVISIONS AND RENT CAPS HOWEVER AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO HAS LIMITED ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TENANTS MUST TAKE THEIR CASES TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE GUIDANCE IN THIS PROCESS. OUR BILL WOULD ALLOW ENFORCEMENT BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT THIS MEANS THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY- DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR COUNTY COUNCIL CAN ENFORCE THE TENANT PROTECTIONS. THE MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE VOTED FOR AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IT IS THE LAW WE SIMPLY WANT TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. AS GEN I'M FLOOR THE HOUSE PRICES ONLY GOTTEN WORSE SINCE LAST YEAR THE REASON HOMELESS COUNT ON THAT THEIR SIXTY SIX BY. MILES INDIVIDUALS A COW. NO THAT HOMELESSNESS IS A SPARE HIS HEART AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. FOR THIS HOMELESS COUNT TOOK PLACE BEFORE KOBE NINETEEN AND THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT MORE PEOPLE HAVE FALLEN TO HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF LOSING THEIR JOB AND NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY THE RENT. EVEN WITH THE EXISTING STATEWIDE EMERGENCY MEASURES LOW INCOME TENANTS ARE STILL AT RISK FOR ILLEGAL EVICTIONS. A RECENT LA TIMES ARTICLE SHOWED THAT THE LA POLICE RESPONDED TO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED NINETY INSTANCE. A POTENTIAL ILLEGAL LOCKED OUT AND UTILITY SHOT OF ACROSS THE CITY. THE LARGEST SHARE OF THOSE CALLS WERE PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME WORKING POOR LOS ANGELES. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT KEEPING PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AND PREVENTING EVICTIONS WILL PREVENT TENANTS FROM BECOMING HOMELESS. TENANT STABILIZATION MUST BE A PRIORITY OF OUR STATE. I KNOW THAT SOME COLLEAGUES HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE FINES IN THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS I WANT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT I WILL WORK TO TAKE OUT THE FINES IN THE NEXT HOUSE- AND I HAVE LEDGE COUNCIL LANGUAGE TO THAT OF. OUR STATE THE OPPORTUNITY BRING SB ELEVEN NIGHT BEFORE YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING NONE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN I'M SORRY EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME- CENTER BOARD JUST SHOWING I'M SORRY I MISSED MICROPHONE. IS AGAIN STILL POSSIBLE OR NO IT IS POSSIBLE IN THIS A MOMENT HERE- CENTER BOARD JUST BEFORE WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE VOTE- THE FLOOR SURE SURE. THE MAN PRESENT APOLOGIZE THAT WAS A TACTICAL SHOWS CONSULTING WITH THE SERGEANTS- QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION SENATOR ALSO. COULD I ANSWER AT THE END. IF THAT'S CAN I ANSWER THE AND CERTAINLY BUT THE QUESTION FROM CENTER BORCHERS AND YOU CAN ANSWERED IN YOUR CLOSE. THEIR BORDERS. WE'LL DEALT WITH THIS IN JUNE. THERE WERE A COUPLE ISSUES AND FORGIVE ME I JUST WANT TO KIND OF REFRESH AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT. I UNDERSTAND. THE FIRST WAS A SELF ATTESTATION THAT THE INDIVIDUALS A TESTING THAT A CRIME HAD OCCURRED. AND THERE'S ANOTHER IF I RECALL CORRECTLY THAT THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN A LAW ENFORCEMENT- OUR RECORD. AND I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT. THAT WAS ALL ST STILL ALSO INCLUDED IN THE LATEST VERSION OF THIS AND- I THINK THE LAST POINT WAS. THE CAN YOU IMAGINE EXAMPLES WHERE THIS COULD BE MISS YEARS MEANING THAT AN INDIVIDUAL JUST USES THIS TO GET OUT OF A LEASE AND TO THE DETRIMENT OF- A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION. VERY GOOD- ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ARE DEBATING IN HEARING ON CHARTER DORADO IF YOU'D LIKE TO ANSWER THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU FOR SURE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT YES WITH REGARDS TO THERE IS A RIGOROUS- ARE RULES ABOUT- HAVING A THIRD PARTY OF VERIFY THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED SO EITHER LAW ENFORCEMENT- A SOCIAL WORKER THAT IS INVOLVED IN IN THE- WITH THE FAMILY OR WHAT THEIR INDIVIDUAL WITH THE BIG DOWN THE MOST AT THIRD PARTY. OF VERIFICATION ALONG WITH A STATEMENT FROM THE ATTENDANT TO WHAT TOOK PLACE AND WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP ON BECAUSE OF TWO POINT DOESN'T FAIL THAT JUST SAYS A CRANK UP WITH IT AND SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH THE TENANT AS WELL AS THE THIRD PARTY VERIFICATION. THAT PROVIDED I'M SORRY I. DIDN'T WRITE DOWN THE SECOND WHAT WAS THE SECOND ONE. WELL FIVE SO PEOPLE COULD AVOID THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION OF THE RENTAL AGREEMENT THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE PLEASE TALK INTO THE MICROPHONE WITH THE WE'RE HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY- AND I'M SURE ANYONE LISTENING IS PROBABLY HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY OUTSIDE THE CHAMBER SO PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SPEAK RIGHT INTO THE MICROPHONE THANK YOU THANK YOU THE A YOU KNOW CAN I GUARANTEE THAT A THIS FOR THE RIGHT REASONS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY COULD WITH ANY LAW. BUT I MUST SAY IN THIS TIME OF HOUSING I CAN IMAGINE THAT IT'S EASY TO JUST GET UP AND GO AND FIGHT WE HAVE TO PUT SIX THIRTY IN THE POP THAT IN. UP TO THE LAN I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE JUST GEN AND THE LOW FOR ANY TO THIS IS FROM IT'S VERY TRAUMATIC FOR A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY- TO BE THE VICTIM OF A CRIME OR FOR YOU TO BE ACROSS OF A CRIME YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BILL TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE BECAUSE IT BE THE H. FURTHER. AS THEY WANTED TO CARE OF YOUR FAMILY. SO A LOT. I CAN'T AND- THAT SOME WOULD DO THIS LIST IN IN A VERY FRIVOLOUS WAY. SO WITH THAT. WAS THAT YOUR CLOTHES.

AMBERG SENATOR DORADO MOVES A CALL MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM THIRTY ONE CENTER DORADO. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL TWELVE FIFTY SEVEN BY SENATOR DORADO AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT SENATOR RUSSELL THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR. I THINK I'M GONNA PUT A DESK HERE OKAY. CURRENTLY COLLEAGUES DOMESTIC WORKERS ARE EXCLUDED FROM BASIC HEALTH AS A SAFETY PROTECTIONS AFFORDED ALMOST ALL OTHER WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA SB TWELVE FIFTY SEVEN REMOVES THAT DISCRIMINATORY EXCLUSION. ADDRESSING THIS EXCLUDES IS PART OF A DRESS IN A LONG HISTORY OF EXCLUSION OF DOMESTIC WORKERS FROM BASIC LABOR PROTECTIONS AND IT IS A PART OF OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. THIS IS A- IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES WHEN DOMESTIC. SLAVES WILL BE PERFORMED PRIMARILY BY AFRICAN AMERICANS WE EXCLUDED THIS WORK FROM THE BASIC WORKPLACE SAFETY PROTECTIONS ESTABLISHED FOR OTHER WORKERS AND THAT EXCLUSION HAS CONTINUED TO THIS DAY. THE CURRENT OVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND CALIFORNIA'S DEVASTATING WILDFIRES HAVE MAGNIFIED THE VULNERABILITY THAT HOUSEHOLD DOMESTIC WORKERS FACE ON A DAILY BASIS BECAUSE THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM CAL OSHA. THE WORKERS WERE PRIMARILY IMMIGRANT WOMEN ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND TO THE ABILITY OF US AS CALIFORNIANS TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. AND THEY DESERVE DIGNITY AND PROTECTIONS JUST LIKE OTHER WORKING MEN AND WOMEN. IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO ALLOW CAL OSHA TO CREATE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INDUSTRY SPECIFIC REGULATORY GUIDANCE TO HELP IMPLEMENT THIS BILL. JUST AS THE RELEVANCE SAFETY ITEMS PROTECT THE WORKERS IN THE LABORATORY OR DRY CLEANERS A SAW MILL IS DIFFERENT SO TOO WILL THERE BE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES THIS INDUSTRY. ADVISE FOR BY THIS BILL COMPRISED OF EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES WILL BE TASKED WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE TYPE OF CARD IS NEEDED FOR THIS TYPE OF WORK PLEASE. I KNOW- SEVERAL OF YOU HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT EMPLOYER PRIVACY AND PLEASE KNOW THAT THERE ARE DUE DUE PROCESS SAFEGUARDS WITHIN THE BILL. THE BALANCE THE NEED FOR PRIVACY WITH COMPLIANCE THE BILL WILL ONLY. ALLOW FOR ON SITE INSPECTION IF THE EMPLOYER DOES NOT ABATE ANY HAZARD CONDITIONS AFTER BEING CONTACTED BY PHONE BY LETTER BY OSHA. EVEN AFTER THAT THE EMPLOYEE. THE GREAT PERMISSION FOR AN- AND THE PREMISES FOR THE AGENCY HAS TO SEEK A COURT ORDER BEFORE ONSITE INSPECTIONS CAN OCCUR. MOST WORKPLACE SAFETY CONCERNS WILL BE ADDRESSED LONG BEFORE GETTING TO THAT POINT. COLLEAGUES THE POINT OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH OF. THOSE WORKPLACES THOSE HOMES HAVE THE BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ARE. STANDARDS FOR THOSE DOMESTIC WORKERS IN RECENT YEARS DOMESTIC WORKERS HAVE SECURED MINIMUM WAGE OVERTIME AND WORKERS COMPENSATION PROTECTIONSNOW WOULD BELIEVE THEY NEED THEY ARE ASKING THAT THEY BE TREATED ARE GIVEN THE DIGNITY OF BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS. ONE END BY SAYING THERE IS NO OPPOSITION RECORDED ON THIS BILL I ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO DEBATE OR DISCUSSION WE WILL START WITH SENATORS WIENER. LET OF A AND CAME. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT BECAUSE I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TWELVE FIFTY SEVEN. AS THE TALK OF THE SEVEN SIX TO RIGHT THE WRONGS OF HISTORY OF EXCLUSION OF THE MEXICAN IMMIGRANT WORKERS FROM BASIC LABOR PROTECTIONS. IT'S EXCLUSION IS ROOTED IN THE RACIST OPPRESSION OF BLACK DOMESTIC WORKERS. AND THE LEGACY OF SLAVERY ONE BLACK WORKERS PARTICULARLY DOMESTIC WORKERS AND FARMWORKERS WERE FIRST EXCLUDED FROM BASIC LABOR PROTECTIONS IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES. HOUSEHOLD WORKERS CHILD CARE WORKERS HEALTH KEEPERS HOME CARE WORKERS DAY LABOR IS LIKE GARDENERS ARE THE ONLY GROUP WORKERS. OR EXCLUDE. ON THE CAL OSHA. DOMESTIC WORKERS ARE AT THE FOR. OF THE CURVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THEY WORK WITH OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS LIKE THE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WHO ARE IMMUNO OMPROMISED. HOWEVER MANY DOMESTC WORKERS ARE ALSO VULNERABLE WORKING WITHOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS FOR LONG HOURS AND FOR VERY LOW WAGES MANY LACK ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND PAID SICK DAYS. THAT MIGHT ENABLE THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES DURING THIS HEALTH CRISIS. DURING THIS TERRIBLE TIME DOMESTIC WRKERS OFTEN HAVE TO MAKE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE BETWEEN WORKING IN UNSAFE CONDITIONS. OR GOING WITHOUT ANY INCOME. IN A TIME OF A DANGEROUS GLOBAL PANDEMIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS ARE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO JUSTIFICATION. TO CONTINUE EXCLUDING HOUSEHOLD DOMESTIC SERVICE EMPLOYEES FROM BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY EXACT- PROTECTIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNERS- LEYVA THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB TWELVE FIFTY SEVEN WHICH WILL HELP PROTECT THE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOMESTIC WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA THE PROVIDE CARE AND SUPPORT TO HELP HOLD ACROSS OUR STATE. AS YOU MAY REMEMBER IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I AUTHORED AND THEN GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED SB TEN FIFTEEN ALSO KNOWN AS A DOMESTIC FOR DOMESTIC WORKER BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH PERMANENTLY PRESERVED OVERTIME PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA PRIVATELY HIRED DOMESTIC WORKERS. SEN THE SENATE STOOD THEN AND I HOPE WILL STAND AGAIN TODAY WITH THESE AMAZING WORKERS PRIMARILY IMMIGRANT WOMEN. 98% SO THATTHEY CAN WORK WITH DIGNITY RESPECT AND THE SAFETY THAT THEY DESERVE DOMESTIC WORKERS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER WORKER IN OUR STATE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO FILE A COMPLAINT IF NEEDED. ABOUT IT WORKLACE HEALTH OR SAFETY HAZARD WITH CAL OSHA AFTER ALL THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT WHEN THEY GO TO WORK THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH ABUSE OR HARASSMENT AS WELL AS ANY SUBSTANCES OR CHEMICALS THAT MIGHT HURT THEM. YES THE REQUESTED WORK IS UNIQUE IN THAT WORKERS COME INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES TO PROVIDE CARE AND SUPPORT FOR ALL FAMILIES AND THEIR HOUSEHOLDS. BUT JUST BECAUSE DOMESTIC WORKERS PERFORM UNIQUE WORK DOES NOT IN ANY WAY MEAN THAT THEY SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS. EVEN NOW DURING COVERED NINETEEN DOMESTIC WORKERS ARE DOING FRONTLIE WORK THAT IF ANYTHING MAKES IT EVEN MORE CRITICAL THAT THESE THEY HAVE THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. DOMESTIC WORKERS EVER HAVE TO RISK THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY JUST SO THEY CAN HELP PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. SO MEMBERS LUCY AND RICKY'S HARD WORK PERFORMANCE TODAY BY IN THIS STORE COAX OF DOMESTIC WORKERS. AND AS THE DAYS. THANK YOU. YOU SHOULD LEAHY CENTER. THANK BETTER PRESIDENT SENT. TO HI EIGHTY CERTAINLY THE BILL AND THE AT I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YA AND- SHE WILLIAMS WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION SENATOR DRAWS. YES MA'AM. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR- I KNOW WE HAD SOME THAT EXCELLENT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BILL I THINK THE- PART AND I KNOW YOU TOUCHED ON IN YOUR REMARKS BY JUST WANT TO CLARIFY. IS THAT THE CERTAINLY I AGREE WITH YOU THAT DOMESTIC WORKERS DESERVE TO HAVE A HEALTHY AND SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT- AND THAT ANY LACK OF HEALTH OR SAFETY NETWORK ENVIRONMENT NOT ONLY OF COURSE- IS NOT GOOD FOR THE WORKER- IT ALSO ISN'T THAT PROBABLY ISN'T A GOOD FOR THE PERSON IS LIVING IN THAT HOME BUT IT IS A PERSON'S PERSONAL RESIDENCE AND SO THERE MIGHT. BE NEED TO BE SOME SENSITIVITY ABOUT THAT- SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THAT YEAH AND I KNOW YOU REFERRED TO SOMETHING'S BUT ARE YOU COMMITTED TO DO PERHAPS IN THE ASSEMBLY THINKING ABOUT ADDING SOME WEIGHING JUST. PRICE OF THE ATHEA EMPLOYER IT'S A PERSONAL RESIDENCE SO THAT- OUTSIDE OF ANY HEALTH OR SAFETY INSPECTION BECAUSE THEY'RE AND SOMEONE'S PERSONAL HOME THAT THERE'S A DUTY OF PRIVACY TO IN TERMS OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT THE INSPECTOR MIGHT SEE THEM YOU KNOW MAY HURT THEIR REPUTATION OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AS WELL SO I JUST WHY SURE THAT- WE A BE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE FEAR AN INSPECTOR COMING TO THE HOME NOT BE HEALTH OR SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE OF OTHER PRIVACY ISSUES AND SURE PEOPLE'S PRIVACY. RESIDENTS HE'S DORADO YOU LIKE TO RESPOND YES ON CENTER I WILL ABSOLUTELY COMMIT TO THAT- IT IS NOT OUR INTENTION TO CONFUSE THE LINES BETWEEN THE PRIVACY OF THE HOME. AND THE HOME AS THE WORKPLACE THE PART OF IT THAT'S A WORKPLACE SO I ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU AND STRENGTHENING OR CLARIFYING THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND- WITH THAT I WAS CERTAINLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I'D APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR WOULD ADDRESSES AS A QUESTION OR JUST RESPOND IN HER CLOTHES. I AM CONCERNED THAT A LOT OF THESE DOMESTIC WORKERS TO WORK IN PRIVATE RESIDENCE. AND IF OSHA IS NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER THESE PRIVATE RESIDENCES IN THE GO GET A COURT ORDER. I DON'T KNOW I'M THINKING ABOUT THE FOURTH AMENDMENT I'M THINKING ABOUT- JUST PRIVATE RESIDENTS PROP YOU KNOW PROPERTY RIGHTS AND PRIVATE RESIDENCE RATES AND I REALIZE AGAIN THAT WE HAVE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT THE DOMESTIC WORKER. AND THERE ARE ABUSES OUT THERE BUT I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU START MESSING WITH SOMEONE'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE AND THEIR PRIVATE HOME. THERE'S GOING TO BE A HUGE ISSUE PERTAINING TO THAT SO I WOULD ASK AGAIN. FOR BILLS TO BE THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDERED BEFORE THE MOVE FORWARD SO THAT- IT CAN BE THE RIGHT WAY INSTEAD OF PUTTING A LOT OF OUR HOMEOWNERS. IN A POSITION WHERE. YOU KNOW THESE. I'VE SEEN THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW FOR BUSINESSES THAT THEY DO SEE SINCE DISORDERS THAT THEY STOP PEOPLE FROM OPERATING THEIR BUSINESS I MEAN IS GONNA FOLLOW TRUE AND SET PRECEDENTS. FOR HOMEOWNERS WE NOT BE ALLOWED TO LIVE THERE AND I KNOW THAT SEEMS FAR FETCHED BUT- YOU IN THE BUSINESS WORLD IF THEY DON'T. COMPLY WITH OSHA THEY GET A COURT ORDER THE AFTER THE SEASON'S ASSESS THEY STOP THE BUSINESS FROM OPERATING PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS. SO WHAT HAPPENS IN A HOME SETTING IS A GOING TO FOLLOW THE SAME PACE. AS THE PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR OR IS IT GOING TO BE HANDLED DIFFERENTLY. AND I THINK A TOUCHY SUBJECT SITUATION THAT WE HAVE YEARS OF THESE ARE PRIVATE HOMES THAT. CAL OSHA THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS WILL BE ENTERING SO- I WOULD REQUEST A NO VOTE. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR HERTZBERG. YEAH I JUST WANT TO JOIN IN ON THE- THOUGHT OF THE SENATOR FROM SACRAMENTO. WITH RESPECT TO THE CONCERN HERE WE WRITE THE LAW WE IMPOSE THE GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO FIND PEOPLE TO TAKE AWAY THEIR LIBERTY AND WE HAVE TO EXERCISE THAT IN THE MOST ELEGANT AND APPROPRIATE WAY. THE GREATEST CHALLENGES AREN'T THOSE WITH THE BLINDS OF BRIGHT. THE GREATEST CHALLENGES OF THOSE WITH THERE'S DEEPLY CONFLICTING INTERESTS. PRIVACY AND WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR HOME AS WE HAVE LOOKED AT THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY IS SACROSANCT. THAT MUST BE BALANCED BY. THE OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN ARTICULATED HERE ON THE FLOOR TODAY. BUT IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY WHO BRING SOMEBODY IN TO HELP OUT THE CLEANED OUT BECAUSE SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ILL OR SOMETHING. AND THEY'RE USING A DETERGENT THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO FORD BECAUSE THEY'RE SAVING MONEY FOR THEIR KIDS TO BUY A NEW PRESIDENT OR TO PAY FOR A KANSEN NEO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE OR YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PUT A NEW STAIR RAIL ON SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BILL RICKETY BUT YOU BEEN WORKING AT YOUR HOUSE FOR TWENTY YEARS AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO NAVIGATE IT. IT'S A CHALLENGE. AND SALAS SAYS I WILL VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY. BUT I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE ABILITY TO DRAFT THIS IN A WAY. THAT BALANCES THESE CRITICAL CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. IT IS EASY TO FIND THE EXAMPLE. BUT IT IS ALWAYS THE EXAMPLE THAT FOLKS THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE EVERY DAY WHERE SOMEBODY COMES IN. AND THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. SOMEBODY COMES ALONG THEY GOT A BEEF. THEY'RE CALLING OSHA. WE GOT TO FIGURE THAT OUT SO I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IS I WILL VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE I THINK THE CAUSES RIGHT. BUT I THINK IT REQUIRES DEEP. HOMEWORK IN DRAFTING THIS IN A WAY WHERE WE DO NOT STEP ON THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. WELL WE STILL PROTECT FOLKS THAT COME INTO THOSE HOMES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MAN. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SENATOR DOLLINGER. THANK YOU I JUST CAN YOU CAN ASISTIR BECAUSE THIS WITH THIS INCLUDE IN HOME SUPPORT OF WORKERS. RIGHT THAT TO IT THAT IS A QUESTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE THE SENATOR ANSWERED IN HER CLOTHES VERY GOOD. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. FIGHTING IN HEARING NONE CENTER DORADO YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED BY MY COLLEAGUES AND I SUPPORT THE ISSUES THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE PRESENTED. I JUST WANT TO REMIND US THAT THIS ISN'T A ONE BY ONE IT IS A ONE BY ONE CASES ARE WHERE PEOPLE LIVE BUT IT'S REALLY A WHOLE INDUSTRY. LET'S NOT FORGET IT'S AN INDUSTRY WHERE IT IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WOMEN. AND THE WAY THAT WE MIGHT LOOK AT WOMEN ONE WOMAN IS THE WAY THAT ALL WOMEN ARE BEING LOOKED UPON IN THAT INDUSTRY. THEY NEED PROTECTIONS. BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN CASE AFTER CASE AFTER CASE IN SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN AFFORDED THE MOST MINIMAL BASIC HEALTH STANDARDS- SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS A WHOLE INDUSTRY. WE ALSO ARE VERY CONCERNED AND WE WILL WORK VERY VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRIVACY OF THE HOME IS NOT. A CROSSOVER. WE REALLY THESE WOMEN REALLY MADE TO HEAR THEIR STORIES. NO MATTER WHAT PART OF THE STATE THE RENT WE HEAR THEIR STORIES ABOUT SITUATION UP TO SITUATION AND HOW THEY ARE NOT GIVEN THE MOST MINIMAL BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS.

THE LEVEL OF REVIEW WITHOUT ONE HAS BEEN INSUFFICIENT AT BEST HERE'S WHAT THE BILL DE THIRTEEN TWELVE PROVIDES THE NECESSARY FRAMEWORK. TO SHORTEN DECREASE THE FREQUENCY OF POWER SHUT OFF EVENTS IN THE OLD EMILY ELIMINATE THEIR USE BY REQUIRING INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. TO GO SHORT OR LONG TERM STEPS TO HARD RIVER STRUCTURE.

POWERED WHEELCHAIR LIFT BATTERY ONLY LASTED SEVENTY TWO HOURS AND THEY HAD NO WHERE TO RECHARGE IT AND THEN THERE WERE THE VOLUMES OF LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BUSINESSES FOOD BANKS AND RESEARCH LABS ALL IN THE LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE DARK ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON THE COMMUNICATION WASN'T THERE THE PLANNING WASN'T THERE AND TO BE HONEST THE C.

IT DOESN'T ADVOCATE FOR NO SHUT OFF WE NEED P. S. P. S. IT JUST PUTS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE AND HOLDS THE CPUC ACCOUNTABLE TO DEVELOP A STANDARD FOR UTILITIES AND ENSURE THAT THEY INVESTIGATE ALL SHUT OFF COLLEAGUES. THIS IS A GREAT BILL IT IS A THE SOLUTION IS NOT TO LIMIT THE UTILITIES ABILITY TO DEPLOY PS PS AS NEEDED BUT TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND PRUDENT SEE IS USED IN THAT DECISION MAKING.

ALL SENATORS PLEASE FOURTH WITH TO THE SENATE FLOOR. COLLEAGUES WE ARE NOW HEADED TO FILE ITEM THIRTY THREE. SENATOR DORADO. FILE ITEM THIRTY THREE. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL THIRTEEN NINETY NINE BY SENATOR DURAZO AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT SENATOR TO ROSS SO. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. SENATOR DORADO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. RIGHT NOW PRIMARILY WOMEN IN THE ARE THE GARMENT INDUSTRY ARE AT WORK MAKING THE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THAN ENABLES US TO BE HERE TODAY AND THAT OUR BUSINESSES AND SERVICES NEED TO RE OPEN AND REBUILD. GARMENT WORKERS ARE DOING THIS WORK MOST OF THEM IN VERY HARSH CONDITIONS AND MANY OF THEM FOR AN AVERAGE OF FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT'S A THIRD OF THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. THESE WOMEN AND MEN ARE DOING ESSENTIAL WORK FOR OUR HEALTH AND OUR ECONOMY. AND THEY FINALLY BECOMING VISIBLE. SB THIRTY NINETY NINE WOULD PROTECT GARMENT WORKERS FROM EXPLOITATION. AND BUSINESSES FROM UNFAIR COMPETITION MEMBER THIS IS ABOUT GOOD BUSINESSES GOOD EMPLOYERS AS MUCH AS IT IS ABOUT THE GARMENT WORKERS THEMSELVES. WE LOOK TO ELIMINATE THE PIECE RATE IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE BORROWER WORKERS ARE BEING PAID FULLY FOR ALL OF THE TIME SPENT WORKING. WE'RE GOING TO ENFORCE THE LIABILITY. FOR WAGE WHILE ASIANS AND CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AS TO THE IDENTITIES OF THE BRANDS BASED ON GARMENT WORKERS TESTIMONY. EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZED THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S BUREAU OF FIELD ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE AND SIDE THE BROWN'S. SB THIRTY NINETY NINE MAKES CLEAR THAT A BUSINESS CONTRACTING TO HAVE GARMENTS MADE IS LIABLE FOR UNPAID. ON PAY MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME PAY TO THE WORKERS TO MANUFACTURE THOSE GARMENTS. THAT'S WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY LAYERS OF CONTRACTING THAT PERSON MAY USE. SO CALLED RETAILERS ACTUALLY CONTRACT WITH A NETWORK OF MANUFACTURERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO PRODUCE THEIR GARMENTS AND DICTATE THE PRICING STRUCTURE. THIS LEADS TO VICIOUS PRICE COMPETITION AND GARMENT WORKERS BEANS THAT PAID A THIRD OF THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. AWAY STEPPED REPORT FROM UCLA DOCUMENTED THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS IN LA AS A WHOLE NEWS TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. PER WEEK. NOT PER YEAR TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS PER WEEK AND WAGE THEFT VIOLATIONS NO INDUSTRY WITHIN. THOSE ARE OUT WORKERS IS MORE RIGHT WITH THESE VIOLATIONS THAN GARMENT MANUFACTURING. THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR UNCOVERED WAGE VIOLATIONS AT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. OF A SURVEY OF SEVENTY SEVEN GARMENT SHOPS THEY INVESTIGATED RANDOMLY. RESULTED IN ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN BACK PAY FOR EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE WORKERS. GARMENT WORKERS IN LOS ANGELES OF REGULARLY WORK MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS PER DAY. AND IXTY TO SEVENTY HOURS PER WEEK FOR RECEIVING. SUCH LOW PAY AND NO OVERTIME. UCLA FOUND THAT IN ADDITION TO THE DIRECT THE FACT OF LOST INCOME TO THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK SO HARD. MONEYTHAT IS LOST TO OUR STATE AND LOCAL ECONOMIES BECAUSE OF THE WAY STEPPED IN LA COUNTY ALONE. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT TAX LOSSES ANNUALLY. TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN LOST EARNINGS ONE POINT THREE MILLION AND LOST INCOME TAX. FORTY TWO TO NINETY TWO MILLION LOST SALES TAX REVENUE. LAST CONTRIBUTIONS TO CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING TAX AND DISABILITY INSURANCE TOTALING SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. MANY MANUFACTURERS HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO ENSURE SAFE CONDITIONS OR THE PROPER MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME PAYMENTS FOR THE WORKERS PRODUCING THEIR GARMENTS UNLESS THEY FACE LIABILITY. WE AT THE STATE HAVE TO DO MORE TO PROTECT THE LOW WAGE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY OUR PROTECT RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES WHO ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW. YOU KNOW PROVIDING ETHICAL SAFETY STANDARDS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES ESPECIALLY NOW AS WORKERS RISK THEIR HEALTH TO MAKE THE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT LIKE MASKING DOWN THAT ARE NEEDED TO GET US THROUGH LOS ANGELES A GARMENT INDUSTRY HAS A SPECIAL NICHE. IN THE WORLD OF GARMENT AND FASHION. AND THAT NAY AGES FAST FASHION I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT BUT I'M LEARNING ABOUT IT FAST FASHION. WHERE YOU DESIGN IT AND YOU GET IT TO THE MANUFACTURE AND YOU GET OUT INTO THOSE STORES AND IT HAS TO CHANGE CONTINUOUSLY- SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE THAT PRODUCING SENSIBILITY GREATER STABILITY IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY FOR THE BUSINESSES AS WELL AS FOR THE EMPLOYEES. COLLEAGUES I NOTE SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE THERE'S BEEN A LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DORADO DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AS THE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT TODAY AT OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE THE GARMENT WORKER PROTECTION ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY THIS IS ACTUALLY A PRIORITY BILL FOR THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. AS WE'VE SEEN DURING THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS SHORTAGE OF PROTECTIVE MASKS AND RELATED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT PP HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN TURN MANY GOVERNMENT WORKERSWERE CLASSIFIED AS ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND JUST LIKE MANY OTHERS INDUSTRIES A MAJORITY OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY ARE WOMEN. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC MANY GARMENT WORKERS WERE ALREADY WORKING IN DIFFICULT CONDITIONS FOR MINIMAL PAY WITH LITTLE RECOURSE TO RECOVER THEIR UNPAID WAGES AND LOST OVER TIME PAID DUE TO THE EXISTING STRUCTURE. THIS PANDEMIC HAS SHED A LIGHT ON THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT WITH IN THIS INDUSTRY AND IS EXPOSED MANY OF THE POOR CONDITIONS THAT WORKERS EXPERIENCE FOR OUR SAFETY AND FOR OUR COMFORT TO THAT END SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE SIX TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR MANY WOMEN AND MEN. IN THIS INDUSTRY MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU A SENATOR GROW FALL BY SENATOR ATKINS. ONE SECOND THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. YES SENATOR GROW THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT QUESTION THE AUTHOR. WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION. I ANSWERED THE END. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DO THAT GO AHEAD NATIONAL QUESTION CENTER GROVE SO I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY TYPE OF INDUSTRY THAT'S EXCLUDED FROM THE CURRENT LABOR CODE AND I WAS CURIOUS IF YOU HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT THE GARMENT INDUSTRY WAS EXCLUDED. FROM CURRENT LABOR CODE SET BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT REQUIRES A MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE PAID WORKERS COMP TO BE PAID. AND YOU EVERYTHING THAT WERE REQUIRED IS EMPLOYER FIVE DEFENDER FOR THE CITY TO DO WORKS POPULAR JUST NAME IT. SO IS THE GARMENT INDUSTRY EXEMPT FROM THE LABOUR CODE OR TO THE LABOR CODE LAWS THAT ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPLIED TO THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. THANK YOU CENTER GROW ANYTHING FURTHER. I THINK IN PART IT WAS A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. CENTER WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION OUR WHICH RATHER WAIT TILL YOUR CLOTHES I LIKE TO WAIT TIMES CLOSE TO HEAR ALL THE QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. I DID NOT HEAR MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES I SEE THAT SO ON MY OWN TIME TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NO INDUSTRY THAT IS EXEMPT FROM THE LABOUR CODE IN THESE LABOR STANDARDS THAT ARE PUT FORTH BY THIS BODY. ENFORCED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL ASIANS APPLY TO ALL EMPLOYERS REQUIRED TO PAY MINIMUM WAGE FOR TO COVER PEOPLE ON WORKERS COMP- ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH- WITH THIS LABOR CODE THAT IS SET. WITH THE EXCEPTION. OF IF THESE EMPLOYEES ARE UNDER A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. BECAUSE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT CONTRACT LAW SUPERSEDES LABOR LAW. SO NGUYEN SAY FOSTER FARMS OR- A COMPANY DOWN IN LOS ANGELES THAT I READ THEY CAN'T REALLY THINK OF THE NAME OF RIGHT NOW. ENGAGED IN. A CONTRACT LABOR AGREEMENT OR FOR. A LABOR AGREEMENT. THAT PAID THE EMPLOYEES BELOW MINIMUM WAGE AS LONG AS THE EMPLOYEE AND THE EMPLOYER AGREED UPON THAT. AND THEY COULD SUBSTITUTE THE WAGE WITH PIECE RATE THAT'S OKAY. BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NOT ONE EMPLOYER THAT IS EXEMPT FROM THE LABOUR CODE AGAIN UNLESS YOU'RE UNDER CONTRACT LABOR AGREEMENT. SAYS DIFFERENTLY THE TEAM PLAYING THE PLAYER AGREE UPON. THERE'S NOT ONE INDUSTRY THAT IS ALLOWED TO VIOLATE THE LABOR LAW AND LAWS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT. LABOR THAT MANUFACTURING CLOTHING MANUFACTURING COMPANIES HAVE TO PAY MINIMUM WAGE. OR THEY HAVE TO PAY A PIECE RATE- THAT ALLOWS THE EMPLOYEE TO MAKE A MINIMUM OF THE MINIMUM WAGE AND IF THE EMPLOYEE. AT PRODUCES MORE GARMENTS THE OF THAT MINIMUM WAGE THEY GET TO EARN ADDITIONAL MANY AND THEN PLEASE. DON'T THE GARMENT. IS MAKE THE MAN PAGE. SO THAT THE LAW AND THAT'S THE AY IT READS IT ALSO SAYS THAT THE LAWS REQUIRED TO- MAKE SURE THE EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED UNDER WORKER'S COMP THE PAIN THE WIFE AND THE PIANO FOR SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT. YOU ARE PROVIDING YOUR EMPLOYEE WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT NO ONE IN THE STATE IS INVOLVED IS- EXEMPTED FROM CAL OSHA. CAL OSHA CAN STILL GO INTO THESE GARMENT MANUFACTURING PLACES AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT. SO THE CLAIMS ON THE FLOOR I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY BAD EMPLOYERS IN EVERY TYPE OF INDUSTRY. BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW WITH CAL OSHA. END OF THE LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL LABOR THE- FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING IT DOESN'T STOP ANY OF THESE AGENCIES FROM GOING IN TO PROTECT THESE EMPLOYEES. AND FIND THESE EMPLOYERS THAT ARE DOING THIS BAD THING. WHAT I DID NOTICE IN THE BILL IS IT JUST SAYS HERE AND I KNOCKED MY LITTLE SIGN DOWN. IT'S IS IT ELIMINATES. THE PIECE RATE PAY FOR EMPLOYERS WITHOUT A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IF YOUR PAIN EIGHT PIECE RATE. AND SOME OF YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE MAKING FORTY FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO DO THAT. UNLESS YOU JOIN A UNION. SO YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO OFFER THAT BENEFIT TO YOUR EMPLOYEES TO MAKE IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM WAGE. UNLESS YOU JOIN A UNION AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL SAYS THE LANGUAGES RIGHT THERE. SO I JUST ASK YOU GUYS THAT. LET'S JUST WE ARE IN A POSITION ESPECIALLY WITH COVE IN. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERY EMPLOYER HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EMPLOY PEOPLE AND LET THOSE PEOPLE MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT VIOLATING THE LABOR CODE WHICH SAYS YOU HAVE TO PAY MINIMUM WAGE. SO IF YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYER WHO IS A NON UNION COMPANY AND THEY'RE PAYING FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR PLUS PIECE RATE OR FOURTEEN DOLLARS OR TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR WHATEVER MINIMUM WAGES NOW. PLUS PIECE RATE SO THAT THOSE EMPLOYEES CAN BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED IN PAY MORE. FOR THE AND GET EARNED MORE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. WHAT WHAT REQUIRED THEM TO BE UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT BENEFIT. THERE'S NO THAT MAKES NO SENSE IF THE IF THE EMPLOYEES WANT TO WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER. ON A PIECE RATE BASIS AS LONG AS EMPLOYERS MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE PAID MINIMUM WAGE. WHICH IS THE JOB OF THE INDUSTRIAL THE LABOR DEPARTMENT TO. WHICH IS THE JOB OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO HEAR. US SAFETY PRACTICES AND LABOR CODE ISSUES. THEN LET THEM DO IT LET THOSE EMPLOYEES MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE ON PIECE RATE AND THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BELONG TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT TO DO IT. ALL THIS DOES IS GIVE ANOTHER ARM SO THAT UNIONS CAN GO INTO THESE MEN CLOTHING MANUFACTURING COMPANIES. AND THEY CAN GO LOOK IF YOU WANT. JANE DOE TO CONTINUE OR BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY WOMEN IN THIS INDUSTRY IF YOU WANT JANE DOE AND YOUR EPLOYEES TO MAKE MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO JOIN A UNION YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE A LOT OF PAIN IN PEACE RATING MORE- OR YOU CAN SPEND THE AVERAGE RATE OF TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND THEN THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TO DO MORE- WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS WORKING REALLY HARD AND LIKES THEIR JOB IN WANTS TO PRODUCE MORE AND EARN MORE MONEY. IT MAKES NO SENSE ESPECIALLY COMING OUT OF A CODE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE RESTRICT PEOPLE. FOR MAKING MONEY UNLESS ARE BELONG TO. IT THIS. I'M SORRY BUT IT'S GETTING SO FAR OVER THE LINE AND I HOPE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZE THIS. I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ROVES THE SENATOR MELENDEZ IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- SAID THIS BILL SEEKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WORKING IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY OR PAY TO FADE A FAIR WAGE- AND SPECIFICALLY IT WAS MENTIONED THE PRODUCTION MANUFACTURE OF PVP. SO DIFFERENT STYLES OF CLOTHING IN THE MASKS LIKE WERE ALL WEARING. YET THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SECURITY CONTRACT WITH THE COMPANY TO MAKE THESE VERY ITEMS IN CHINA. WHERE VERY LIKELY DOES WORKERS WERE NOT BEING PAID THE WAGES THIS BILL SEEKS TO IMPOSE ON CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA WHO COULD MANUFACTURE. THOSE MAPS SO THAT WILL BE SENT AS IN THIS IS A LEVEL OF HYPOCRISY THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE PART ASIDE AND- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO IMPOSE. THESE TYPES OF WISE ON CALIFORNIAN PLOY PLAYER SHOULDN'T WE WALK THE WALK. DOESN'T THAT MAKE CENTER FOR GOING TO IMPOSE THIS ON A POOR SHOULDN'T WE MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTRACTS WE ARE- ENGAGING IN FOLLOW THE SAME RULES BECAUSE SO FAR WE HAVEN'T AND IT WAS. A BILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY SO UNTIL WE CAN KIND OF BRING DOWN THE LEVEL OF HYPOCRISY THAT I SEE- IN THIS BILL. THAT I CAN'T SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS. WHAT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES- YOU KNOW FAMOUS LAST WORDS I ACTUALLY DIDN'T INTEND TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL FIVE HOW MANY TIMES ARE WE GONNA HEAR THAT TODAY BUT YOU KNOW I FELT COMPELLED TO GET UP AND SPEAK YOU KNOW AFTER YESTERDAY IT SEEMS YOU KNOW YESTERDAY WAS SUCH A TIME OF REFLECTION. WE ARE. THOUGHT ABOUT A LOT OF DEEP ISSUES- IN OUR SOCIETY AND SO MAYBE I'M- FOLLOWING ONTO YESTERDAY BUT- YOU KNOW MY MOTHER WAS A SEAMSTRESS. AND SHE WORKED FOR SHE WORKED PIECEMEAL. AND I REMEMBER IN THE EIGHTIES NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THAT WAS THIRTY SIX YEARS AGO. COMING HOME FROM COLLEGE AND SEE MY MOM AT THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH A PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL. AND DOING HER FIGURES AS SHE WOULD SAY FIGURING OUT WHAT SHE HAD MADE THAT DAY. AND SHE WAS VERY GOOD MY MOTHER WAS AN INCREDIBLE SEAMSTRESS BUT I WANT TO SAY I YOU KNOW I'M BACK YOU'RE TALKING WITH THE GOOD SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE- WAGE ISSUES AND HE WAS. AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MINIMUM WAGE AND WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE MINIMUM WAGE AND HOW YOU WOULD HAVE TO WORK TOWARDS THE MINIMUM WAGE AND HAVE IT DEDUCTED STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT. OVER FROM A HUMAN PERSPECTIVE. YOU KNOW I WATCHED MY MOM- DO HER FIGURES AND FIGURE OUT HOW WELL SHE HAD DONE THAT DAY AND THEN THE NEXT DAY AND THEN THE NEXT DAY. AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT MEANT FOR OUR FAMILY AT THE END OF THE WEEK. AND YOU KNOW I ALSO NOTICED AS SHE GOT OLDER. YEAH I'M NOT SURPRISED THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS ARE WITH THE IN THE IT'S SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE- IT HAS A PARTICULAR IMPACT ON ON WOMEN NOT THAT IT DOESN'T IMPACT- AND MEN AS WELL. BUT A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THIS INDUSTRY ARE WOMEN. AND I REMEMBER AS MY MOM GOT OLDER AND OLDER. AND HOW IT USED TO JUST REALLY BOTHER HER BECAUSE SHE GOT SLOWER AND BACK TO HER MEANT SHE WASN'T. UP TO SNUFF SHE WASN'T AS GOOD AS SHE WAS. WHEN SHE WAS- CRANKING OUT. THOSE INCREDIBLE DRESSES IT HOW MODE INDUSTRIES IN ROANOKE VIRGINIA AND WE WOULD GO TO THE J. C. PENNEY. AND WE WOULD SEE THOSE DRESSES THAT MY MOTHER HAD MADE THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THAT WHOLE PRODUCTION I WORKED THERE ONE SUMMER IN BETWEEN COLLEGE. HARSH JOB ALMOST I EVER HAD AND I THOUGHT I GET TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE. AND MY MOM IS GOING TO GO BACK TO THAT FACTORY EVERY SINGLE DAY AND SHE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO MAKE PEACE. PIECE RATE. N. YOU KNOW I JUST THINK IT'S BEYOND THE TIME IN WHICH WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AND SAY IS THIS RIGHT. YOU KNOW WE ARE TRYING TO BE PROTECTIVE OF WORKERS AND- AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE. STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW AND TRYING TO CONTINUE TO BE VIBRANT. ARE FROM THE RETAILERS AND MANUFACTURERS ALL PEOPLE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO SUPPORT AND FIND A WAY. FOR THOSE INDUSTRIES. TO BE VIABLE AND ECONOMICALLY SOUND FOR OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIFTH. LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. I JUST THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND REALIZE THAT GARMENT INDUSTRY WORKERS HAVE HISTORICALLY AS HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED. SUFFERED FROM SUBSTANTIAL WAGE THEFT. FROM NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE ENOUGH- YOU KNOW I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE BECAUSE I ACTUALLY REMEMBER. WHAT IT WAS LIKE LIVING THROUGH THAT TOM EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T THE ONE THAT HAD TO GO IN AND DO THAT WORK. AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE STAND UP FOR THOSE WORKERS AND WE PROTECT THEM FROM WAGE THEFT WE MAKE SURE. THAT YOU KNOW THY'RE GOING TO WORK A HARD DAY BUT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO OFFSET THAT MINIMUM WAGE AND GET THERE AND IF YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE REALLY GOOD DON'T MAKE MORE THAT'S TRUE. BUT I JUST THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF. ICE TOM THAT WE WRITE SOMETHING THAT MAYBE. WE SHOULD OF TAKING CARE OF A LONG TIME AGO THIRTY SIX YEARS. THIRTY SIX YEARS AND SO AND SOME OF THESE FOLKS CAN MAKE AN AVERAGE OF FIVE FIFTEEN AN HOUR. I MEAN. MY MOTHER AIMED FOR FIVE FIFTEEN AN HOUR AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THAT WAS SOMETHING. NOT THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS SENATOR GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES- I ALSO STAND INS VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE THE GARMENT WORKER PROTECTION ACT AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS ANOTHER MEMBER FROM LOS ANGELES WAGE THAT VIOLATIONS IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY IN OUR AREAS HAVE BEEN AGREE JUST FOR A VRY VERY LONG TIME. GARMENT WORKERS DESERVE A LIVING WAGE THESE ARE MOSTLY WOMEN SOMETIMES WOMEN OF COLOR AND THE ABSOLUTELY DESERVE A LIVING WAGE- BUT THEY ARE NOW OF COURSE AS WITH A MENTION PRODUCING MASKS WHICH ARE CRITICAL TO HELP SPREAD THE VIRUS BUT TO HELP REDUCE SPREADING OF THE VIRUS DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND THE IRONY TODAY. THAT GARMENT WORKERS ARE ALSO VULNERABLE IN THIS HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CRISIS DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE WIDESPREAD EXPLOITATION AND LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY BY THESE BUSINESSES MY DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR ESPECIALLY THE SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES REGION IS HOME TO MANY GARMENT WORKERS IN THE VERNON AND HUNTINGTON PARK IN SOUTH LA REGION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE SEEN INCREASED AMOUNTS OF FACTORIES MOVE INTO THESE AREAS AND WITH LOW PROTECT FOR WORKERS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO A FEW WORDS PLEASE I'M A CONSTITUENT TO RESET GARCIA AND HER STORY TO RESELL IT MY DISTRICT THIRD FOR FASHION OVER BUILDING A SHOCKING RATE AN EXPERT LABOUR USES NEW YORK TIMES I THOUGHT AND AS LITTLE AS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR SIXTY FIVE HOURS OF WORK. IN A WAY. QUICKLY OF THREE DOT IS AND FORTY SIX CENTS AN HOUR FOR IN TWENTY. THAT'S NOT MINIMUM. SHOULD THE FACTORIES RECEIVING ORDERS FROM FASHION OF A FOR UP TO FIVE THOUSAND PIECES OF CLOTHING AT A TIME. SHE WAS PAID BY THE PIECE WE OFTEN HEAR THAT IF WE WORK HARD WE CAN MAKE MORE MONEY BUT WORKING SIXTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK AND GETTING PAID THREE FORTY SIX AN HOUR. IS NOT FAIR PAY AND NOT MINIMUM WAGE FOR HEART WEEKS WORTH OF WORK. AND CLEAR VIOLATION OF LABOR LAWS MISS GARCIA WAS PAID WELL. TO CONTINUE IN OUR STATE. HOW CAN WE ALLOW TWENTY DOLLAR SHIRT TO VALUE MORE THAN SOMEONE'S PROTECTIONS IN SOMEONE'S HOURLY WAGE. I JUST WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE AGAIN FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND WE MUST VOTE YES AND I AND I. AM FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ SENATOR GALGIANI FULL BY SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS UNLIKE MANY OF YOU I'VE STRUGGLE TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAD A MASK FROM MANY MONTHS AGO IN FACT WHEN THIS BEGAN BECAUSE WE WERE ALL TRYING TO ORDER THEM AND THERE WAS A BACKLOG WE COULDN'T GET THEM FOR SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS. SO I BORROWED MY MOM'S SEWING MACHINE AND I STARTED MAKING SOME FOR MYSELF AND MY WIFE MARY LOU AND MY FAMILY AND SOME FRIENDS AND THE FIRST ONE I MADE TOOK ABOUT TWO HOURS. AND THEN AFTER ABOUT TEN OF THEM I GOT A LITTLE FASTER AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE ONE A LITTLE BIT OVER AN HOUR ON AT SEA YOU CAN BUY THESE MASKS FOR THREE DOLLARS AND FORTY FIVE CENTS. MADE IN THE USA. WHAT THAT TELLS ME. IS THAT WHILE WE DON'T KNOW WHO THESE COMPANIES ARE. THEY ARE OUT THERE AND THEY ARE PAYING SUBSTANDARD WAGES TO THEIR WORKERS. THERE'S NO WAY THAT SOMEBODY COULD MAKE A MASK. AT WITH THE MATERIALS AND WORKERS COMP PRICES AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. AND BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY PROFIT. IF THEY'RE PAYING MINIMUM WAGE. AND THEY'RE SELLING A MASK FOR THREE DOLLARS AND FORTY FIVE CENTS AN HOUR. THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU CENTER GALGIANI SENATOR RUBIO FOLLOWED BY A SENATOR GROW. SENATOR RUBIO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND I WANT ALSO STRAINING COACH MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT IT AS WELL I MEAN I THINK MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY AT WORK THIS IS SO PREVALENT AND EVIDENT I GREW UP IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES- AND JOB THAT'S FOR THE GARMENT INDUSTRY IS. AND IF YOU EVER GO INTO ANY OF THESE MANUFACTURERS IT'S REALLY HEARTBREAKING TO SEE I MEAN THERE'S A REASON WHY THEY CALL THEM SOMETIMES SWEAT SHOPS AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND I'M VERY MINDFUL THAT IT'S NOT EVERY SINGLE MANUFACTURE. BUT IN PARTICULAR I'M SPEAKING ABOUT THE AREA LOS ANGELES DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WHICH WE CALL THE GARMENT INDUSTRY AND SO I HAVE SEEN THE ABUSES IN THOSE INDUSTRIES AS I. WAS GROWING UP I KNOW A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT DON MADE THEIR MONEY FROM WORKING IN THESE INDUSTRIES AND SO I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT MEASURE- JUST BASIC PROTECTIONS FOR THESE WORKERS AND AN ADEQUATE LIVING WAGE IS IMPORTANT STILL I RISE IN SUPPORT OF IT AND HOPE THAT YOU SUPPORTED TO THINKING. THAT A PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR. SENATOR GROW AND THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WHAT I DID WAS I GOING TO SPEAK ON IT AGAIN BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND THE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SAYS THAT PIECE READING COMMISSION PAID EMPLOYEES MUST RECEIVE AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE. PEACE THREE EMPLOYEES MUST ALSO BE PAID AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE FOR ALL THE TIME SPENT ON TASKS NOT SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED IN THEIR PIECE RATE UNDER THE NEW LABOR LAW EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPENSATE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE PAID BY A PIECE THREE BASIS FOR THE REFER RESTED WE CAN FREE PERIODS AND OTHER NON PRODUCTIVE WORK TIME. SO THE LAW ALREADY STATES THAT ANYBODY PAIN PIECE RATE IS REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE PAID MINIMUM WAGE. SO THIS BILL. I DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE- THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT CAN GO INTO THE GARMENT DISTRICT THREE GUYS ARE SHARING THESE HORRIFIC STORIES. OF SOMEBODY WORKING SIXTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK AND MAKING THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT IS ILLEGAL UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE LAW ON HIS EMPLOYER I AM JUST. IT'S REPREHENSIBLE THAT SOMEONE WOULD TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEES LIKE THAT. BUT THE LAW ALREADY EXIST IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB BY NEGLECTING. GOING INTO THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE IN THE LOS ANGELES GARMENT DISTRICT AREA. THEN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. BUT TO PASS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT SAYS YOU CAN ONLY PAID PIECE RATE. IF IT'S A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS BENEFICIAL EITHER TO THE MANUFACTURE OR THE EMPLOYEE THEMSELVES. BECAUSE IF THE IF THE AGREEMENT ISN'T MADE THEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE PAID PIECE RATE. AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXCEED THE LIMITS OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN ARE THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND SO I JUST AGAIN IT IS LABOR LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE LABOR CODE THAT WE PASS THAT REQUIRE INDIVIDUALS ON P. ST TO MAKE THE MINIMUM STANDARD OF MINIMUM WEIGHT. AND THEN ANYTHING ABOUT THAT IN EXCESS IS ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IN THE EMPLOYEE'S POCKET. THE ONLY THING THAT THIS BILL DOES IS REQUIRE ONLY- IN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CONTRACTS TO BE ABLE TO. AND PEACE SO AGAIN I JUST NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT'S IN CALIFORNIA LAW. AND LIKE I SAID THE STATE THAT WERE TAUGHT. FULLER I DON'T DOUBT. THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED THOSE. AND IS THE MOST POWER DELEGATION AS THE LEAD THE LOS ANGELES DELEGATION. I SUGGEST YOU MEET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND TELL THEM TO GET THEIR HAPPY BUT DOWN THERE AND CORRECT THE SITUATION. THANK YOU SIR GROVER SENATOR FURTADO. CHOOSE ME BEFORE YOU SPEAK HAS JUST BEEN CLEARED OFF CLEAN DOT. ALRIGHT VERY GOOD CENTER HER TITLE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM- PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK SENATOR ALSO FIRST AND FOREMOST AND APPRECIATE HER EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR GARMENT WORKERS ARE PROTECTED FROM WAGE THEFT. OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW I SUPPORT THIS THIS BILL IN ITS IN ITS CONCEPT IT REALLY EASY FOR ME TO SUPPORT IT HERE TODAY BUT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY MOM AND HER STORY AND HER BACKGROUND IN MY STORY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IS WELL. MANY OF YOU KNOW HER HAVE MET HER SHE WAS HERE ON THE SENATE FLOOR OFFER MY SWEARING IN MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I REPRESENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE SOUTHERN VALLEY WHERE- AGRICULTURE IS A IS A MAJOR PART OF OUR LIFE WELLA MAJOR PART OF OUR LIFE HAS ALSO BEEN I MOTHER WORKING A GARMENT AND VERY MUCH THE PRETENCE MOTHER AND SO. AS I MENTIONED. JUST A BIT AGO IT'S REAL EASY FOR ME TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE- I DON'T WANT ANY WOMAN. ANY PERSON ARE TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. NO I DON'T THINK ANYONE OF US SHE HAS THAT VALUE- BUT- WHEN I WAS TALKING TO MY MOM ABOUT IT. I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL. I REALLY DIDN'T- LIKE I SAID IT'S VERY EASY FOR ME TO SERVE SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT- SHE CAME TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN UNDERSTANDING FROM. HER BEING IN A BEING A WORKER IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. AND I YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY WE SPOKE ABOUT THE PER PIECE. THE WAVE OF MAKING THAT YOU KNOW MONEY. AND SHE TOLD ME THAT HER ALONG WITH A LOT OF FAMILY FRIENDS THAT STILL LIVE IN THE SAME COMMUNITY THAT I LIVE IN- ACTUALLY MADE MUCH MORE MONEY. ARE UNDER THE PER PIECE AND YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT THOSE TIMES WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND YES IT'S HARD WORK I MEAN I WISH THAT. THAT YOU KNOW THAT MY MOTHER HAD IN A DIFFERENT OPTION WHICH SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK IN IN IN IN THE LABOR INTENSIVE- JOB BUT BUT THIS IS THE TYPE OF OPPORTUNITY THAT SHE- WITH GIVEN AND SHE DID WELL IN IT THAT PROVIDED TO MY FAMILY. IT PROVIDED ME WITH. ENOUGH OF FOOD WITH ENOUGH CLOTHING- TO GET ME WHERE I AM TODAY. AND YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT YOU KNOW SHAME ON ANY INDUSTRY. THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE BASIC BENEFIT OF HEALTH CARE AND IT DOESN'T PROTECT THE WORKERS I DON'T SUPPORT THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS A CHALLENGE. GIVEN MY BACKGROUND MY HISTORY. AND MY MOTHER'S HISTORY. KNOWING THAT- AT A TIME WHERE WERE FIFTEEN YOU KNOW 15% OR UP THE ONE THAT I LIVE IN. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT WE WOULD JEOPARDIZE- EIGHTY INCOME FOR ANY WOMAN I'D I I'D IT TERRIFIES ME AND I DON'T. I DON'T WANT TO PUT ANY WOMAN AND THAT KIND OF SITUATION OR ANY OTHER PERSON REALLY THIS IS A TIME WHERE WE NEED TO CREEK FURTHER EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS- NOT TO RISK BE ALREADY LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE DO NEED TO MAKE THAT WE HAVE AT HAND- AND SO TODAY I WILL. NOT SUPPORT THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM BUT I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING ADDITIONAL OF THIS BILL OUT WHEN IT COMES BACK SO I CAN SUPPORT IT BECAUSE THEY DO BELIEVE THAT WOMEN NEED TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. A TO BE PROVIDED WITH CARE- BUT I'M HOPING TO SEE SOME CHANGES THAT CAN GET ME TO A POINT WHERE I CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR LET ME START BY SAYING I'M STANDING IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE WILL SPROUT THE CO AUTHOR WITH THE AUTHOR ON A BILL LAST YEAR ON TO PROTECT WAIT STAFF. I JUST WANTED TO BRING TO EVERYONE'S ATTENTION A I SUPPORT THE BILL LABOR COMMITTEE BUT- THAT IT IS A- LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS TWENTY TWENTY PRIORITY BAIL- PROUD THAT MY MAYOR MY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- GARMENT WORKER CENTER. LABOR FEDERATION NUMBER PEOPLE SUPPORT IT- AS I LISTEN TO THE STORIES ABOUT MOTHERS I THOUGHT ABOUT MY MOTHER. FLATLY DIFFERENT VARIATION ON THE STORY. MOM SHE LIVES AT NINETEEN FIFTY THREE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GRANT. AND SHE GOT THERE BECAUSE THE GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL EARLY. AND IT IS OFTEN THE CASE KIDS WERE SMART ENOUGH TO GRADUATE EARLY SOMETIMES A MOSTLY ARE QUITE READY FOR THE REAL WORLD. SOLD MY GRANDMOTHER TOLD HER WHAT YOU SAID ADDING YEAR TO YOU YOU KNOW. GET A LITTLE OLDER THEN WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU GONNA DO AND SO SHE SPENT THAT YOU'RE WORKING IN A ZIPPER FACTORY IN DOWNTOWN LA. AND THE STORY THAT I GREW UP UNDERSTANDING THE PART OF THE REASON WHY SHE WENT TO YOU WITH THE AND GOT HER DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK WITH BASED ON HER EXPERIENCE WORKING ALONGSIDE WOMEN. IN THE ZIPPER FACTORY. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH BLACK WOMAN AT USC IN THE FIFTIES MINORED IN SPANISH SO SHE SPOKE FLUENT SPANISH- AND SHE TOLD THE STORY ABOUT THE LAST DAY AT WORK IN THE ZIPPER FACTORY FIRST OF ALL THE PIECEMEAL- AND YOU KNOW THE PIECEMEAL PAYMENT GOES BACK IN HISTORY. LAW THAT ALSO IMPACTS YOU KNOW BLACK WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR AND WORKING WOMEN IN TERMS OF THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD GET WORK- PULSE RECONSTRUCTION IRONING CLEANING PIECEMEAL. AND IT WAS A WAY TO YOU KNOW NOT REALLY PAY YOU FOR YOUR WORK. BUT SHE TOLD THE STORY THE ZIPPER FACTORY WHEN THERE WAS A FIRE IN THE ZIPPER. THERE IS A WERE ALSO LEAVE THE REAL THE DOOR HIS BILL THE DOORS BEEN CHAIN LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE KEEP PEOPLE THEY'RE WORKING LONG HOURS WITHOUT TAKING MAKES A REALLY VIOLENT BEING LATE LOS EVEN BACK IN THE- AND SO YOU KNOW. I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTY NINETY NINE BECAUSE THIS IS TWENTY TWENTY. AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE STILL HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HAVING TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND. TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO CERTAIN ASSETS. IT REALLY TO ME PERSONALLY SINCE. I APPRECIATE BUSINESS NEEDS TO DO BUSINESS PARTICULAR PULSE CO THE WHICH WE WEIRD TO TALK ABOUT I'M SURE FOR YEARS TO COME HOW WE HAVE TO SUPPORT BUSINESS PULSE CALLED IT AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT NO. BUSINESS OUR SHIP. POWER TO MAKE A PROFIT ON THE BACKS OF THEIR WORKERS. PAGE I SHOULDN'T I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT SB THIRTY NINETY NINE. THANK YOU- SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR DODD. PRESIDENT SKIS ME. I'LL TELL YOU THAT THE CENTER FROM LOS ANGELES JAVED JUST GAVE SOME COMPELLING REMARKS I WAS NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS TODAY AND LISTENING TO THE PRO TEM AND LISTENING TO OTHERS HAS GOT ME TO THE POINT WERE. YOU KNOW I AM A CONSIDERING SUPPORTING THIS BUT I WANT TO LISTEN. TO THE CLOSE OF THE BILL'S AUTHOR HERE. AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW IS IT IN TWENTY TWENTY. WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR WITH WHAT THIS BODY HAS BEEN DOING. WITH WHAT WE WOULD TRY TO GET DONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR YEARS. HOW IS THAT HAPPENING. IN THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY VERY DISTURBING TO ME THAT WE HAVE RULES AND REGULATIONS IN PLACE. THAT WE HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE THAT WE'VE ALL WORKED VERY VERY HARD. TO SUPPORT IN THIS CHAMBERS AND OTHERS. AND YET WE STILL HAVE VIOLATIONS LAW WHERE IS THE ENFORCEMENT IT'S SO I'M THE LIST. WAY THE CALL. SHE RESPONSE ALL UP IN SUPPORT OF NOT I WILL LAY OFF TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR DRAW CHAU YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU. AND I WANNA THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES WHOSE- SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND A PARTICULAR TEACHER R. PRO TOWN FOR SHARING THE STORIES. I HAVE WORKED UNDER PIECE RATE. BOTH IN THE FEELS. IN AGRICULTURE AS WELL AS FOR VERY VERY SHORT TIME IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. AND A WHAT THAT INDUSTRY HAS DONE AND IT HAPPENS IN OTHER INDUSTRIES IT IS IT'S CREATED SUCH A WEB. OF COMPANIES AVOIDING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TRIED TO ADDRESS IN THIS BILL. HE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY THE CONTRACTOR WHO IS THE MEDIA YOU KNOW PER- COMPANY THAT HIRES SOMEBODY ON. HE CAN CLOSE UP WE ACTUALLY CLOSES UP SHOP TODAY. WHEN PAYROLL IS DUE AND IT OPENS UP UNDER ANOTHER NAME DOWN THE HALL ON THE SAME FLOOR WHERE ALL THESE CONTRACTORS ARE IT OPENS UP UNDER A NEW NAME. TO MAKE IT MORE MORE DIFFICULT FOR EVEN A LABOR COMMISSIONER THAT WANTS TO DO THEIR JOB. TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB. THERE WAS A LOT PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BRING. REAL LIABILITY TO EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THAT. LINE OF RESPONSIBILITY LINE THE MANUFACTURING AND IT DID WORK FOR AWHILE. BUT THE COMPANIES FOUND ANOTHER WAY OF GETTING OUT OF PAIN AND ITEM HAVING LIABILITY AND THAT WAS THROUGH THEIR BRANDS. THE BRAND'S DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY ECAUSE I HIRE A BUNCH OF COMPANIES DIFFERENT LAYERS OF CONTRACTORS SO THAT WHEN THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION AND BECOME SO DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE BUT YOU CAN'T PIN THEM DOWN AND THAT'S WHY THEY GET AWAY WITH IT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. IT'S A RIGHT TO DO WHAT WE DO IN THIS BILL IS TO FIND THE BRANDS. LIABLE FOR THE WAGES AND THE CONDITIONS OF THOSE EMPLOYEES- AND THAT THE TESTIMONY. OF THOSE WORKERS. TOGETHER WHAT ACTUALLY THEY BRING I THOSE LITTLE LABELS THAT THEY SOLD ONE. TO SAY THIS IS WHY WE WORK FOR. CAN YOU FIND YOU KNOW THIS IS WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ME MY MINIMUM MIGHT MY WAGES. SO IT'S GOTTEN HARDER AND HARDER TO ENFORCE BECAUSE THEY FIND WAYS TO GET OUT OF THAT LIABILITY IN THAT ENFORCEMENT SO WE'VE GONE FROM GETTING. YOU KNOW TRYING TO GET BETTER TO WEAR BACK DOWN A ROCK BOTTOM AGAIN. YES IT IS THE LAW. TO BE PAID MINIMUM WAGE IT IS A LOT OF BE PAID OVERTIME. BUT IT IS SO DIFFICULT THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S COULD NOT NAILED DOWN HE IS RESPONSIBLE. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT HERE AND THAT'S WHY THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF OTTEN WORSE AND WORSE AND WORKERS ARE. I HAVE MET WITH DOZENS HUNDREDS OF THESE WORKERS TO TELL ME THE SAME THING. THIS IS WHAT WITH THE CHANGE WE NEED IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO START TO GET PAID EVEN THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. THERE IS NO ELIMINATION OF INCENTIVES IT'S INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. THAT THERE ARE WAYS FOR AN EMPLOYER TO GET BONUSES AND INCENTIVIZE MORE PRODUCTIVITY THE THING IS THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE AND IT'S ABOVE THAT. SO THERE IS STILL WAY. IN A AND A AND AN ETHICAL WAY AND OF FAIR WAY. FOR WORKERS TO GET MORE. BASED ON THEIR PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INCENTIVE BONUS PROGRAMS SO THAT'S VERY CLEARLY IN THE BILL. YOU KNOW I GOT CONNECTED WITH PLEASE OF WORKERS LAST YEAR. WHEN THEY CAME BEFORE A SUBCOMMITTEE ON. TRYING TO GET THEIR WAGES FROM UP RESTITUTION FUND THAT THE STATE HAS. THEY WERE ALL WOOD SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH AND THERE WASN'T ENOUGH MONEY IN THAT RESTITUTION FUND TO TAKE CARE OF THEM SO WE STEPPED IN TO FILL THE VOID. AND THEY GOOD FOR HER FROM LOS ANGELES CENTER MITCHELL AND I WENT TO A CELEBRATION. WHERE THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOSE GARMENT WORKERS. AND TO THINK THAT THEY WERE CELEBRATING. BECAUSE THEY FINALLY GOT SEVERAL YEARS LATER THEY FINALLY GOT PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE. THINK ABOUT THAT. THE FINALLY GOT PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES THERE WERE. WE'RE JUST ECSTATIC AT BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. COLLEAGUES PAYING A FAIR WAGE AND GIVING US GIVING OUR LABOR COMMISSIONER THE TOOLS TO DO THAT IS WHAT THESE WORKERS NEED SOUL I VERY PROBABLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

SENATE BILL NINE FIFTY TWO BY SENATOR NIELSEN AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY TAX LEVY SENATOR NIELSEN MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE SENATE THIS IS A DAY FOR BILLS THAT ARE DEALING. WITH THE RAVAGES IT WE'VE HAD TO SUFFER WITH FIRES. AND PUBLIC SAFETY HAVE SHUT OFFS. AND STATE A CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS AN ATTEMPT TO HELP OUR- VERY CHALLENGED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DEAL WITH THESE PUBLIC SAFETY SHUT OFF. THE AREA HAVE CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE. TO THE DIVIDING THEM SERVICES REQUIRE THIS POWER. AND IT'S BEST THAT WE MAKE IT IS UNINTERRUPTED AS WE CAN'T. NOW AS WE FOUND OUT THROUGH THIS CHALLENGING TIME THERE ARE MANY ESSENTIAL THINGS THAT THIS POWER PROVIDES. WHAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO HELLO WILL DO FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE. SUPPLYING THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. AND NOT GET THEMSELVES INTO LEGAL DIFFICULTIES SWITCH SOMEWHERE DOWN THE WAY WILL HAPPEN IF WE DO NOT ADDRESS THIS. THIS ALLOWS THEM TO BE FREE OF THE SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT STATE STATE SALES TAX AND USE TAX. FOR THE ACQUISITION. A BACKUP GENERATION EQUIPMENT. THEY'RE ALL GOING TO BE DOING THIS. BUT THEY ARE ALL NOW FISCALLY CHALLENGED. THIS IS A SMALL WAY. TO HELP EASE THAT BURDEN ON OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES PROTECTORS FROM NAPA FROM HEALDSBURG SAN FRANCISCO. AND DEEPER TAKEN SUCH AN INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE. AND WE WORK COLLECTIVELY TOGETHER. NOW PART OF WHAT I'M REFERRING TO HERE AS TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL NINE FIFTY TWO IS IT IT'S STILL REQUIRING SOME WORK. TO ENSURE I THINK WE'VE GOT IT COVERED BUT I'M GOING TO TAKE NO CHANCES ABOUT THAT. AS WE PROCEED WITH THE BILL. WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THE DISHES ENERGY SOURCE NEUTRAL. NEUTRAL THAT MEANS THAT OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN THIS COMPLEX WAY OF PROVIDING OUR ENERGY SERVICES. ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR WHATEVER THAT SOURCE OF POWER MAY BE OR INCLUDING THE BATTERIES THE STORE. RESERVES FOR THOSE NEEDED TIME. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN OVER THE YEARS I'VE REPRESENTED NINETEEN DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. I AM A VERY SYMPATHETIC WITH THEIR FLIGHT MORE SO THAN I EVER HAVE BEEN TO CITY CITIES HAVE FEWER MANDATES AND MANY MORE OPTIONS. TO SECURE REVENUE. THE ACCOUNT X. COUNTIES HAVE THE BLUNT. MANDATES THAT OF A PRESS THEM FOREVER AND MUCH FEWER OPTIONS OPTIONS TO PROVIDE REVENUE. BUT THIS HELPS SMALL IN TERMS OF THIS PUBLIC POWER. DOES IT REQUIRE ANY GIVEN SCHORSCH. THERE'S ALWAYS CONCERN LADIES AND GENTLEMAN ABOUT. DIESEL PETROLEUM SOURCES DOES NOT THIS IS WHAT I SAY NEUTRAL. THE LOCAL ENTITY CAN DECIDE WHAT IS THE BEST TO FIT THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS. AND THEN FOR THAT AND- THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GAIN A GENERAL. A RELIEF FROM THE SALES TAX ISSUE. NOW THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT WHY COULDN'T WE JUST FUND THESE THINGS DIRECTLY OUT OF THE BUDGET. WELL WE KNOW LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THAT THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGING TIME FOR US. IT IS NOT MY WANT HERE TO OBLIGE OUR GENERAL FUND. TOO MUCH NOW YOU GIVE SOME SALES TAX RELIEF THAT HURTS JUST A LITTLE BIT BUT I BELIEVE IT'S THE MOST DIRECT AND HELPFUL MANNER TO HELP. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THERE IS ALSO A REQUIREMENT IN HERE FOR MONITORING AND REPORTING. TO THE LEGISLATURE. HOW THIS IS PROCEEDING. THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE CHARGED WITH REVIEWING AND REPORTING TO THIS HONORABLE BODY. OF THE PROGRESS THAT THIS MAKES THE REVENUE AND HOW IT IS BEING UTILIZED. SO GETTING BACK TO. THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE HERE. YES TO HAVE ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. FOR US TO ENSURE THAT THESE PUBLIC POWER. INTERRUPTIONS SHUT OFFS IS A HARSH TERM. OUR AS EASILY MANAGED AS POSSIBLE. I WOULD WE NOT IN CALIFORNIA EXCEPT THE PS PS IS A PART OF OUR FUTURE. WE JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH. I EXPECT TO SOME DEGREE IT MAY WELL BE. BUT ARE NOT NOT BE THE PREFERRED OPTION. AND WHATEVER WE DO WE NEED TO PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE. TO THE CITIZENS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE MET. CONSISTENT WITH THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR CITIES ARE COUNTIES ARE SPECIAL DISTRICTS. THEREFORE I ASK THAT YOU HELP WITH THIS VOTE I'LL BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS OF THE MEMBERS. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN DEBATER DISCUSSION SENATOR STERN. AT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK. THE DEAN MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM TO HEMA FOR HIS EFFORTS HERE AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN- LIFE AND DEATH CIRCUMSTANCES UP THERE DOWN. HAD SOME OF VERY HARROWING EXPERIENCES OURSELVES DURING PS PS SO I GET THE URGENCY OF THE MEASURE- UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T SUPPORT. THE BILL TODAY. NOT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT DIESEL GENERATOR SHOULDN'T BE THERE IS A SORT OF LAST RESORT BACK UP AND I THINK AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM MARANDA AND NAPA EARLIER WE MADE EFFORTS TO ACCOMMODATE THAT SORT A LAST RESORT EMERGENCY THIS. I RECOGNIZE THE DIESEL WILL HAVE TO BE IN THE MIX IN SOME WAY. BUT WHEN IT COMES USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO INCENTIVIZE BEHAVIOR. AND TO PUT PROACTIVE MONEY ON THE TABLE I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD BE INCENTIVIZING- TECHNOLOGY THAT ISN'T GOING TO PUT OUR AIR QUALITY A RISK OR BOTTOM LINES AT RISK- I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT ON TRYING TO MAKE THE BILL TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. I GUESS I DON'T I'M NOT NEUTRAL WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE IT I THINK THE ONLY INCENTIVES WE SHOULD BE PUTTING ON THE LINER SAY FOR SOLAR STORAGE SYSTEMS ARE FOR FUEL CELL SYSTEMS ARE FOR OTHER. CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY IN FACT WE HAVE A GREAT PROGRAM NOW TO SEE IF YOU SEE THAT ALLOWS THAT AND OUR OUR BUT IT JUST ALLOCATE ACTUALLY FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR. CUT POWER FOR CAN THIS. THERE IS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CURRENT BUDGET FOR COUNTIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THEIR OWN BACK UP. UNFORTUNATELY THE DEFAULT FOR A LOT OF COUNTIES FROM THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THAT WE PUT IN LAST YEAR WAS ALL THESE. IT'S AN EASY THING TO DEFAULT TO. I GET THAT IT'S HARD TO DO THIS DILIGENCE AND TRY TO FIND THESE NEW SOLUTIONS BUT- I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING WITH OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS- THE SORT OF FUTURE SOLUTIONS THAT TO ME ARE HERE RIGHT NOW CLEAN ENERGY MICRO GRADES. ENERGY STORAGE OF SOLAR STORAGE COMBINATIONS THEY CAN BE DONE SO- I DEEPLY RESPECT MIGHT MY COLLEAGUE FROM DANA BUT- TO GREEN. THANK YOU SIR STERN CENTER WERE CASKEY HIGHER RIE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION OF THE MEASURE ALTHOUGH I VOTED FOR IN APPROPRIATIONS YESTERDAY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS DEBATE I TO WILL CHOI MY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM- CALABASAS IS SAID THESE THESE- GOVERNMENT MONEY CEASAR COUNTIES WE WANT COUNTIES TO BE LEADERSHIP IN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND HIS NEW TECHNOLOGY CENTER THAT ARE GOING ON A I APPRECIATE THE ATTEMPT TO BE ENERGY NEUTRAL IT'S- IT'S A OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE NOW TO SEE A WE WANT YOU TO BUY THESE TYPE OF THESE HOLSTERS. ON THURS RENEW ALL ENERGY ALTERNATIVES TO DIESEL THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW THAT I'D LIKE TO COURAGE ALL THE COUNTIES TO BE USING TO PURCHASE SO WITH THAT I'LL BE. VOTING NO. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEMS SHIPPING IN HEARING ON SENATOR NIELSEN YOU MAY CLOSE. MADAM PRESIDENT LATE IN GENERAL THE SENATE. I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTIVENESS THEN THE SUGGESTIONS OF MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL. I BELIEVE THAT IN TERMS OF OUR ENERGY FUTURE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO HAVE MANY OPTIONS. A MARKET BASKET OF SOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES CERTAINLY THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH WERE DOING A MAGNIFICENT JOB OF. IN THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT HIS. BEEN KIND OF PIONEERING IN LOCATING A ONLY AN HOUR WIND POWER. BECAUSE WE HAVE KIND OF UNIQUE GEOGRAPHY OF YOUR GRAPHICAL CONFIGURATIONS THAT PERMIT THAT. THAT'S BUT ANOTHER SOURCE FULLER IS EVERYWHERE AND IT'S GONE A LONG WAYS. WE'VE DONE A LOT TO ENCOURAGE THAT PARTICULAR OPTION. I EXPECT TO WILL CONTINUE TO. IN THE FUTURE. AND AGAIN I DO NOT OFFER THAT THIS IS THE OVERALL SUGGESTION. BUT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. TO ENSURE THAT OUR CITIZENS DO NOT FACE AND SUFFER INTERRUPTIONS THAT IN SOME CASES. COULD BE LIFE THREATENING AND JEOPARDIZING. I URGE AND REQUEST A NO VOTE WITH MY PLEDGE IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE LANGUAGE TO BE EX EXPRESSLY LEGALLY. MANIFESTING OUR INTENT THE HAVE A BROAD BASKET. BROUGHT UP PERTINENTES AND TO BE VERY SPECIFIC IN THE LEGAL LANGUAGE OF THE BILL WILL TAKE THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS AS WE MOVE ALONG AND WORK WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES TO ACCOMPLISH IT JUST AS WE HAVE HERE SO FAR DIRE GINGIVAL.

SENATE BILL ELEVEN FORTY ONE BY SENATOR RUBIO AN ACT RELATING TO COERCIVE CONTROL SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES GENTLEMEN GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN FORTY ONE A BILL THAT DEFINES pCOERCIVE CONTROL AND THE FAMILY CODE. THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT SB ELEVEN FORTY ONE IS CRITICAL BECAUSE AS WE KNOW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT LIMITED TO PHYSICAL BRUISES AND ABUSE. IT ALSO INVOLVES A PATTERN OF BOB CONTROL TO WHICH AN ABUSER DOMINATES EVERY ASPECT OF THE VICTIMS LINE LIFE CAUSING SEVERE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS SOME EXAMPLES OF. CHORUS OF CONTROL INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE A GRADUAL ISOLATION AWAY FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS. WITHHOLDING FINANCES AND BASIC NECESSITIES NECESSITIES INCLUDING USING THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO MANIPULATE THE SITUATION AND KEEP CONTROL. IT MAKES IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY VICTIM TO GET AWAY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS PANDEMIC HAS PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. DATA SHOWS THE NUMBER OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALLS TO THE NATIONAL HOTLINE ARE DRASTICALLY INCREASING AS VICTIMS ARE LOCKED IN WITH THEIR ABUSERS. NEARLY TEN STATES ACROSS THE US HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED THE IMPORTANCE OF NADINE MAY NEED THIS TYPE OF ABUSE IN THEIR STATUTES. THIS BILL SIMPLY ALLOW THE VICTIM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT A JUDGE STILL HAS TO REVIEW THE EVIDENCE. AND DETERMINE IF THERE IS AN ONGOING PATTERN OF ABUSE THAT SATISFIES ALL ELEMENTS OF THE LAW. THIS ALSO INCLUDES A BUILT IN DEFENSE OF REASONABLE NOW SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT CONTACT. UNDER REASONABLE CIRCUMSTANCES IS EXCLUDED FROM THIS BILL EXACT. ONCE AGAIN MEMBERS THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE IT IS TIME THAT WE STRENGTHEN OUR LOSS FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. JUST BECAUSE VICTIMS DON'T WALK AROUND WITH BRUISES ALL OVER THEIR BODY DOES NOT MEAN THEY'RE NOT BEING ABUSED AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR CHAINS THANK YOU MADAM PRESENT MEMBERS DURING THE STAY AT HOME ORDER OTHER CHALLENGES CAME OUT OF THAT IN PARTICULAR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ABUSE GREW. BUT AS WE RE OPEN ECONOMY THESE ISSUES ARE GOING AWAY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT RECOGNIZES ABUSE COMES IN MANY FORMS NOT JUST PHYSICAL ABUSE. WHEN YOU CONTROL SOMEONE FINANCES YOU MONITOR THEM. ISOLATE THEM FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND INTIMIDATE THEM THAT IS ABUSE. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRING THIS BILL TO US AND FOR BEING A LEADER IN THE SPACE. I ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU SIR CHIANG SENATOR BORCHERS.

MENTHOL CIGARETTES SWEETS CIGARS CANDIDATES AND OTHER FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS MASS FOR THE HARMLESS IN HARSHNESS OF TOBACCO AND GET USERS HOPED TO A DANGEROUSLIFELONG ADDICTION. FOR THE FDA HAS ESTABLISHED SOME RESTRICTIONS ON THE CIGARETTES THE FEDERAL POLICY FAILS DANGEROUSLY AND FALL SHORT IN IS RIDDLED WITH LOOPHOLES THE FEDERAL RULES EXEMPT FALL THE ORIGINAL CANDY FLAVOR CAN ONLY RESTRICT FLAVORS IN SOME CARTRIDGE BASED THE CIGARETTES THIS STILL LEAVES E. LIQUIDS IN EVERY IMAGINAL FLAVOR WIDELY AVAILABLE. THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS ALREADY INTRODUCED THE NEXT FAD. HEAP DISPOSABLE E. CIGARETTES THEY'RE CALLED TOUGH BARS. ARE REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THE JEWEL DEVICE. AND COMEIN FLAVORS LIKE BANANA ICE GRAY AND PINK LEMONADE PUFF BARS ARE EASY TO CONCEAL AND WIDELY AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM FEDERAL E. CIGARETTE RESTRICTIONS. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY KIND KID FRIENDLY PRODUCTS THAT ARE EXEMPT. I KNOW WE HAVE HAD TO ASSESS AND TO REASSESS OUR PRIORITIES IN RESPONSE TO THE DEVASTATING COVERT NINETEEN EPIDEMIC. EMERGING EVIDENCE ABOUT SMOKING AND COVERT NINETEEN SUGGESTS THAT SMOKING CAN PUT PEOPLE AT GREATER RISK. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION WARNS THE TOBACCO USE CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF SUFFERING THE MOST SEVERE SYMPTOMS OF COVERT NINETEE. WE KNOW CONCLUSIVELY THAT SMOKING AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD VAPING INCREASES RISK OF RESPIRATORY INFECTION WEAKENS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND IS A MAJOR UNDERLYING CAUSE OF LUNG DISEASE AND HEART DISEASE AND DIABETES. THIS PANDEMIC COMPELS US TO PURGE SMOKERS TO QUIT AND ESTABLISH POLICIES THAT INSURE YOUTH NEVER PICK UP THE HABIT IN THE FIRST PLACE. SB SEVEN NINETY THREE TAKES WITH ACTION TO PROTECT YOUTH AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BY PROHIBITING THE RETAIL SALE OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS. ADULTS CAN STILL BE ABLE TO PURCHASE UNFLAVORED PRODUCT AT RETAIL OR PURCHASE ANY THEY CAN PURCHASE ANY FLAVORED PRODUCT ONLINE. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THEY CAN STILL PURCHASE ANY FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS ONLINE. WELL I AM DISGUSTED BY THE U. THE CIGARETTE EPIDEMIC I'M NOT SURPRISED. IT IS IN LINE WITH BIG TOBACCO'S LONG TRACK RECORD OF DESTROYING AND DEVASTATING OUR COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE OF THE INDUSTRIES AND TOBACCO INDUSTRY'S TACTICS LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY FORTINOS AN AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BUT TOBACCO RELATED MORBIDITY AND DEATH. INSIDIOUS MARKETING OF MENTHOL CIGARETTES HAS EXPLODED AFRICAN AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS FOR DECADES. FORTY FIVE THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICANS DIE FROM A SMOKING CAUSED ILLNESS EACH YEAR. AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT SIX MILLION AFRICAN AMERICANS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WILL BECOME REGULAR SMOKERS AND ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WILL DIE PREMATURELY FROM A TOBACCO RELATED DISEASE. IT'S A FACT STORE FRONT TOBACCO ADVERTISING IS MORE PROMINENT IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS A TARGET ARE THE AUDIENCE OVER 90% OF SMOKERS START BEFORE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. THE AVERAGE AGE OF A NEW SMOKER IS THIRTEEN AND I'VE GONE BACK AND THOUGHT FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. AND NO ONE HAS EVER TOLD ME I'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANYONE THAT SAYS. WHEN THEY WAKE UP WEATHER TO TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE OR THIRTY THEY WAKE UP IN THE MORNING SAY. I THINK I'M GONNA STICK UP SMOKING TODAY. IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY TO ENTICING FLAVORS COLORFUL PACKAGING AND NAMES AND LOGOS SIMILAR TO POPULAR TYPES OF CANDY HAVE BEEN USED SINCE I WAS A CHILD TO GET US HOOKED. BIG TOBACCO WEAPONIZED DECADES OF TREACHERY TO LURE A NEW GENERATION TO NICOTINE ADDICTION. IT'S TIME THAT WE BREAK THAT CYCLE CALLING. THANK YOU SENATOR HILL DEBATE OR DISCUSSION STARTING WAS SENATOR TO ROSS SO FOLLOWED BY SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION AS PRINCIPAL COOPER OF THIS MEASURE THE BABY AN EPIDEMIC AMONG OUR YOUTH IS BEING DRIVEN BY THE WIDESPREAD USE OF E. CIGARETTES AND E. LIQUIDS USED IN BAKED THESE DEVICES AND THE STATISTICS DEPICTING THIS PROBLEM. ARE ALARMING IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE E. CIGARETTE USE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE SEARCH BY A HUNDRED AND 35% THERE ARE NOW FIVE POINT THREE MILLION YOUNG AMERICANS WHO USE EASE CIGARETTES REGULARLY. 80% OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE EVER USED TO BATTLE STARTED WITH THE FLAVORED PRODUCT IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE THE STAND. AGAINST THE WIDESPREAD ADVERTISEMENT AND SELLING OF THESE PRODUCTS TO PROTECT OUR YOUTH I ASK FOR YOUR IBM. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO SENATOR BOARD JUST. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND- THE CO SPONSOR INTENDING GOVERNOR FOR- BRINGING UP THIS ISSUE I THINK WHAT I'VE SEEN- IN MY FORMER CAPACITY IS AN EDUCATOR I'VE SEEN THAT THERE ARE SYSTEM- LESS THAN REPUTABLE. ADVERTISERS IN THE INDUSTRY THAT DO- FIND WAYS TO CAPTURE- INVOLVING MARKET EARLY ON SO I THINK WE DO KNOW THAT- THE YOUTH OR VULNERABLE AND MARKETING DOES WORK AND I CAN HARKING BACK TO. THE US CIGARETTE COMPANY THAT AT ONE POINT TIME DURING WORLD WAR TWO WAS GIVING OUT CIGARETTES TO G. EYES. IT WASN'T BASED ON PATRIOTISM IT WAS BASED ON CREATING- A LOYALTY TO THE BRAND IN THE USERS. THE JOINT I KNOW IT'S THERE. MY QUESTION IS THIS SUFFICIENTLY TAYLOR SO LIKE. IF I COMPOSE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- TO YOU THROUGH THE CHAIR. MADAM CHAIR. WITHOUT OBJECTION. SO I UNDERSTAND THIS DOES NOT THIS THIS BILL DOES NOT COVER ADVERTISING IT IS NOT TAILORED TO MECHANIZED CIGARETTES. IT INCLUDES CHEWING TOBACCO CIGARS AND A LIST WE HAVE. I SUPPOSE SNUFFY PEOPLE EVEN USE NOTHING MORE. BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU IS HOW WAS IT DIFFERENT HOW IS THIS NOT. THE RIVER IS COULD YOU IMAGINE THIS BEING MORE TAILORED NARROWLY TO GO AFTER THE MOST UNIQUE IN VULNERABLE- SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION WHILE STILL PRESERVING THE RIGHTS OF FREE CHOICE. AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK THIS IS TAILORED BECAUSE ITS GOAL IS TO ELIMINATE ALL FLAVORS AND AS I MENTIONED 80% OF ALL THE NEW YOUNG SMOKERS FOR PAPERS OR WHATEVER PRODUCT. USE A FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS SO IT'S THE HARSHNESS OF THE TOBACCO IN THE CASE THAT WHEN I TOOK MY FIRST HIT OF A CIGARETTE I THINK IT WAS THIRTEEN AT THE TIME THAT WAS THE LAST ONE. BECAUSE IT TASTED LIKE. OKAY FRANKLY. AND I WASN'T INTERESTED IN ANYTHING BEYOND THAT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE A CIGAR. WE FIND IT INTERESTING THAT WHICH I THINK IS AN INTERESTING NUMBER THAT. YOUTH THE SECOND HIGHEST USE OF A NUMBER OF SMOKERS AFFECT THE HEAD OF THE NUMBER HERE. IS CIGAR SMOKING BY YOU IS THE SECOND HIGHEST I MEAN THAT IS THEIR SECOND CALL BACK IS SMOKING FLAVORED TOBACCO CIGAR BUT SOME TIME TO THE ID IS THE FLAVOR NOT THE DEVICE THAT IS ATTRACTING THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE NICOTINE AND THEN ONCE THEY GET ADDICTED TO THAT NICOTINE- THEY STILL WANT INCREASE FLAVOR BUT THEN THEY WILL DEFAULT TO WHATEVER PROVIDES THAT NICOTINE FIX IN THE FUTURE. ALRIGHT I WON'T BELABOR THIS MUCH FURTHER- THIS IS A FINANCIAL- IS ISSUED BY PHONE OR IN YOUR OWN TIME SENATOR THIS WILL BE MY LOOK I STILL SECOND MY LAST QUESTION FOR YOU ACCEPT THE SECOND QUESTION CENTER HILL YES IS THAT HE CERTAIN CERTAIN FUNDING SOURCES THAT MAKE THEIR WAY. ROAD OR OTHER SERVICES THAT WE HAVE IN QUE KEPT THE COUNTY LEVEL MYBE THROUGH THE STATE- HAVE WE DEVISED A WAY TO BACK FILL THE DOLLARS THAT WILL LIKELY BE LOS BASED ON THE REDUCED. REVENUE BROUGHT ABOUT BY. THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE WE EXPECT TO BETTER USE WILL PROBABLY DECREASE SOME BECAUSE OF IT. AND I KNOW FOR LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FRESNO COUNTY HAD A MEASURES SEVEN WAS A MAJOR SEE BACK IN THE DAY WHICH WENT TO- HIGHWAY WIDENING AND STUFF LIKE THAT BASED ON TOBACCO USAGE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. DO WE HAVE A BACK FILL OF THE PROJECTED LOSS. TO PASS THAT IS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- THERE ARE THERE ARE TWO PATHS THERE ONE IS- IT FRANKLY AS I LOOK AT IT THERE IS NO PRICE THAT WE SHOULD BE. PAYING NOR A PRICE THAT WE SHOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE TO BACK FILL OR PROVIDE IF WE IF THIS IS MONEY THAT. IS NOT SPENT THEIR OWN LIVES SAVED IN THAT THE ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW FROM A SOME VERY VALID SOURCES THAT THEY WOULD SAVE AT LEAST SEVENTEEN THOUSAND LIVES IN EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN HEALTHCARE COSTS. BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE SUFFERING WILL NOT HAVE IT BUT TO ME IT'S DOLLARS JUST AS WE DO IT DEALT WITH COVERT NINETEEN IN THE PROBLEMS THERE WE WERE WILLING. TO SAVE A LIFE TO GIVE UP A LARGE PORTION OF THE ECONOMY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE PRICE WE PAY IN ORDER TO SAVE LIVES. AND I THINK THERE'S NO PRICE. THAT WE SHOULD PAY IN ORDER HERE OR- ASSUME THAT WE- A WILL LOSE TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE NEXT GENERATION AND THAT NEXT GENERATION BECAUSE IT WILL CONTINUE AFTER THAT SO. THAT THAT WOULD BE MY- MY ANSWER TO THAT TO THAT QUESTION IS THAT THERE'S A THERE'S NO. NO DOLLAR AMOUNT AND- SECONDLY THAT THE HEALTH CARE COST SAVINGS. WILL EQUAL THAT AMOUNT AT LEAST THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU I'M AT AND PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I WANT AYE AYE RIGHTS TAKEN AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL THE SENATOR FROM THE PENINSULA FOR HIS FOR HIS COURAGE AND PERSISTENCE IN THIS MATTER THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR THAT YOU HAVE LED US TOGETHER TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. BUT THAT IT'S A GREAT BILL AND I AM PLEASED TO BE ONE OF YOUR JOINT AUTHORS- IF YOU TALK TO YOUR CHILDREN YOUR FRIENDS CHILDREN YOUR NIECES AND NEPHEWS YOU'LL BE VERY CLEAR TO YOU THAT THIS IS A EPIDEMIC OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY IT'S COMMON ALMOST IT SEEMS LIKE OUT OF NOWHERE- BUT IT IS NOW THE ENTRY LEVEL DRUG FOR OUR YOUTH THIS NICOTINE ADDICTION- IT'S INSIDIOUS IT'S INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS AND ADDICTIVE. AND THIS LEGISLATION IS LONG OVERDUE THANK OU SENATOR AND I URGE AND I'VE A- THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS CENTER RUBIO. BENT I RAISE CATTLE EIGHT IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE- I THINK OUR OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN MATTEO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON AND I PERSONALLY BEEN WORKING ON IT AND BEEN VERY VOCAL ON THIS- I AM ALARMED EVERY TIME I SPEAK TO SOME OF MY FELLOW TEACHERS AT THE CREATIVE NEW WAYS THAT MANUFACTURERS MANAGED TO GET VAPING DEVICES INTO THE HANDS OF OUR CHILDREN. I THE CREATIVITY IN TERMS OF PRODUCING SCHOOL SUPPLIES THAT LOOK LIKE SCHOOL SUPPLIES BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY VAPING DEVICES IS ASTONISHING TO ME FROM AND I FROM STAPLERS TWO PENCILS TO EVEN SURE IT'S AND SO I THINK EVEN THOUGH THIS DOESN'T TACKLE THE MANUFACTURER BEING OF THE DEVICES JUST ELIMINATING THE BABY IN FLAVOR SO ALONE I FEEL IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO STOPPING THIS EPIDEMIC US- OUR COLLEAGUE JUST MENTIONED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THREE MILLION. THREE AND MORE OF A YOU ARE EIGHTEEN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TACKLE NOW VALLEY LATER SO WITH I ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO. PAN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO A TO AT THE GOD FROM SAN MATTEO FOR LEADING- ON THIS BILL AND PROUD TO ALSO BE A JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS BILL THAT IS- MY GOOD FRIEND FROM HORRENDOUS SAID- THAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO PROTECT OUR USE FROM BEING ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. AS A GATEWAY DRUG WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO START VAPING ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXCUSE COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES. AND WHILE SOME OF THE OPPONENTS MAY SAY THAT VAPING IS QUOTE SAFER. THAN CIGARETTES IT STILL DOESN'T MAKE IT SAFE IT'S DANGEROUS. AND WE DON'T WANT OUR USE HOPE TO NICOTINE AND WE HAVE. TREMENDOUS EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. IN THAT AND THEY'RE BEING ATTRACTED BECAUSE OF THE FLAVORS. THAT'S WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS SO THIS BILL IS A NARROWLY TARGETED BUILD TOWARD THAT VERY POINTS THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO USE TO START. USING A DEVICE THAT WILL GET THEM HOOKED ON NICOTINE. PROBABLY FOR DECADES. BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD TO STOP. IN FACT ACTUALLY PHYSICIANS ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOW TO WEAN. YOU OFF THESE DEVICES- BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IN NICOTINE DOSES IN THESE DEVICES ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THEY CAN EVEN GET AND COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTE. THE OTHER THING I WOULD DO ONE OF ALSO TOUCH ON IS THERE IS A QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED ABOUT. BACK FILLING COSTS I WILL POINT OUT THAT THE COST. OF THE HEALTH CARE RELATED TO PEOPLE WHO START VAPING AND THEN PERHAPS MOVE ONTO COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES. IS CERTAINLY A MUCH GREATER BURDEN ON OUR STATE WE HAVE A MEDI CAL PROGRAM- THAT- PAYS FOR A THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WE ALSO HAVE- WORKERS WHO WE COVER ALSO LOCALITIES HAVE THAT AS WELL. IT'S CERTAINLY MUCH GREATER THAN WHAT WE WOULD COLLECT IN TAXES IN FACT THIS IS AN ARGUMENT USED AGAINST PROP FIFTY SIX WELL WAS NOT FOCUS JUST ON BEEPING ON GENERAL SOMEONE CIVIL WHAT HAPPENS OUR ONE STOP SMOKING AND I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT WE WOULD SAVE A LOT MORE MONEY THAN ANY MONEY WE WOULD GATHER FROM THIS BACK ATTACKS AND THEY'LL BE EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN. AND SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT EVEN FROM A STRICTLY FINANCIAL STANDPOINT THIS BILL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BUT I CERTAINLY HOPE WE WILL VOTE FOR THIS BILL NOT BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS BUT BECAUSE- OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS AND CERTAINLY THE MORE BENEFITS WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE OUR USE. ADDICTED TO NICOTINE I ORGANIZED A THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN SENATOR MITCHELL FALL BY SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM PRESIDENT I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATOR HILL SUPPORTED IN COMMITTEE- I'VE TALKED OFTEN ABOUT- YOU KNOW LONG CANCER. TAKING BOTH MY FATHER AND BROTHER WHO WERE EXPOSED TO SMOKING ON IN THE MILITARY AND SO YOU KNOW THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE FOR ME OF AN INDUSTRY THAT PREYS ON UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ACCORDING TO A NATIONAL STUDY SEVEN OUT OF TEN BLACK YOUTH SMOKERS. I YOU KNOW OUR SMOKING THE MENTHOL FLAVOR- IN THE NATION WIDE CENSUS TRACKS WITH A GREATER PROPORTION OF BLACK RESIDENTS HAVE HIGHER TOBACCO RETAILER DENSITY AND SO THIS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE THE NET THE NEXT ITERATION FOR THIS INDUSTRY- ARE THESE NEW PRODUCTS IN TOOLS AND THEY CONTINUE TO ONCE AGAIN PREY ON UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES WHEN I LOOK AT. THE DANCER PROJECTS WORK IN TERMS OF MAPPING THE SPREAD OF COAL BUT NOW LAKE COUNTY AND WHILE YOU WHEN YOU GO FROM. WEST TO EAST AND NORTHTO SOUTH. AND SEEING HOW THE DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO BEEN IMPACTED BY THAT VIRUS THAT ATTACKS THE LUNGS. TO HAVE PRE EXISTING LONG VULNERABILITY AS A RESULT OF LONG TERM SMOKING ONLY EXACERBATES THAT AND SO IS AN INDUSTRY THAT'S PREYED ON MY COMMUNITY AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO ELEVATE THAT. AND DO ALL I CAN TO STOP IT SO I'M PROUD TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN NINE THREE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR BRADFORD FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MORAL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I TO WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HIS HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR BY NO MEANS TO I SUPPORT MARKETING TO KIDS AND I THINK THE FLAVOR TOBACCO INDUSTRY THAT IS CLEARLY WHERE THEY HAVE TARGETED FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. ONE OF MY FIRST BILLS WHEN I GOT TO THE LEGISLATURE ELEVEN YEARS AGO WAS THE BANNING OF FLAVORED BLUNT WRAPS AND I WASN'T ABLE TO GET THAT OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I ARGUED STRONGLY THAT THIS WAS TARGETING OUR YOUTH AND ELEVEN YEARS WE'VE CLEARLY SEEN THE EXPANSION OF THAT MARKING TO. OUR YOUTH I STAND HERE AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO LOST. THIR FATHER. TO LUNG CANCER DESPITE STOP SMOKING FOURTEEN YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH HE STILL SMOKE FOR OVER TWENTY PLUS YEARS AND TO COME THE LONG CANCER TO BE TWENTY FIVE YEARS THIS NOVEMBER. BUT I DO HAVE A CONCERN. AS IT RELATES TO MENTAL BECAUSE WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED AIR GARDNER IN NEW YORK HE WAS KILLED BY POLICE SIMPLY BY SELLING SINGLE LUCY'S AS A SAY MENTHOL CIGARETTES AND IT IS NO DOUBT THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS AS WELL AS THE POOR. THAT IS THE- INSTRUMENTAL. CIGARETTE OF CHOICE FOR THEM I DON'T SEE MANY YOUTH. ARE ANY MANY ADULTS SMOKING A CIGARETTE PRODUCT ANYMORE MOST OF THEM ARE HAVING SOME TYPE OF VAPING DEVICE THAT CLEARLY LETS OUT A PLUME OF SMOKE THAT DOES BLOWS ME AWAY THAT ANY BY WITH. ONE OF FEEL THEIR LONGS WITH- SO MUCH OF FOREIGN MATTER LIKE THAT AND- I'VE SELDOM PANELS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. FROM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY SPECIALLY NOBLE. NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF BLACK LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE BANNING A MAP MENTHOL BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT'S GONNA GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT EXTRA TOOL TO. STOP HARASS INCARCERATE PEOPLE OF COLOR OR POOR SOUL THAT'S MY HESITATION AND I WOULD ASK THAT. EVERYTHING IN THIS BILL I SUPPORT AND IT WE COULD CONSIDER MENTHOL AT THE SAME LEVEL THAT USE CONSIDERED HOOKAH. AND GAVE THEM AN EXEMPTION TO THIS BILL I THINK IT WOULD EASE THE FEARS AND CONCERNS OF MANY FOLKS. ARE AGAIN MOSTLY ADULTS AND I CAN SAY I'M NOT ADVOCATING SMOKING BUT I'M SURELY NOT WANTING TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT SAYS A BAN BUT THE AUTHOR STATES THATYOU CAN STILL BUY SOMETHING SO EITHER IT'S BANNED IN CALIFORNIA. OR DO NOT BECAUSE IF IT'S BANNED IN SOMEONE HAS IT WILL THEY BE ARRESTED FOR HAVING MENTHOL CIGARETTES ON THEIR PERSON. SOUL AND I'M CONFUSED AT THE FACT THAT THE SAID YOU CAN STILL BUY IT ONLINE SO ARE YOU REMOVING IT JUST FROM RETAIL SALE OF SALES IN STORES WHICH CAN STILL BUY IT ONLINE AGAIN. FOR PREVENTS A YOUTH THEN FROM OUR CORN THIS ONLINE SO I JUST HAVE THOSE CONCERNS AND I WOULD JUST WHICH THAT MEANT BY WOULD BE GIVEN THE SAME CONSIDERATION THAT HOPE HOPE HAS BEEN GIVEN IN THIS. MEASURE THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD SENATOR MORLOCK THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I- APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS ABOUT ONE DISEASE AND- I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR HAVING A PASSION IN THE SPACE- JUST FIND IT. IRONIC HOWEVER THAT WHILE WE'RE WORKING TO EMPOWER. MARIJUANA RETAILERS THIS BILL INTERFERES IN THE MARKETPLACE- SO MY LIBERTARIAN STREAK IS A LITTLE CONCERNED. BECAUSE I CAN SORT OF HAVE A POLICY THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO DO. WHAT IS LEGALLY ALLOWABLE TO DO AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT HARMING OTHERS. SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS APPROACH MAY BE MANY STATE IF WE WANTED TO THROW THAT OLD JARGON AND BUT APPROACH TO DEALING WITH A LEGITIMATE PROBLEM. SO IN LOOKING AT THIS IN BEING CONCERNED ABOUT THE YOUTH- I'M WONDERING IF IT WOULD BE ADDRESSED BETTER IF. WE TOOK A DIFFERENT APPROACH- THROUGH A STEEPER PENALTY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO NOT GET. FLAVORED PRODUCTS INTO THE HANDS OF MINORS AND IT IS ILLEGAL FOR STORES TO SELL TO MINORS BUT MAYBE THE PENALTY SHOULD BE DOUBLE OR- TRIPLE OR OR WHATEVER IF YOU ARE A RETAILER AND YOU HAVE SOLD TO A MINOR OR IF YOU PURCHASED IT AND THEN RESOLD IT. AS A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TO A MINOR OR GIFTED IT TO A MINOR THERE SHOULD BE SOME. STEEP PENALTIES BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY RETAILER SHOULD BE- IMPACTED IN AND THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW ADULTS TO PURCHASE FLAVORED PRODUCTS ONLINE SO. SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET A PROFIT BUT IT WON'T BE A THE LOCAL RETAILER SO WE CAN EVEN I DON'T KNOW HOW WE REGULATE ONLINE TRANSACTIONS HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT IT WASN'T A MINOR. AND WHY SHOULD CALIFORNIA RETAILERS BE EXCLUDED FROM SELLING THIS PRODUCT AT A PROFIT SO I'M HOPING THE AUTHOR CAN HELP ME. OUT WITH THAT BECAUSE I APPRECIATE. WHERE HE IS AND WHAT HE'S TRYING TO ADDRESS- BUT I'M HOPING YOU CAN HELP ME IN HIS CLOSING REMARKS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLINGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION I HAVE NOT DIDN'T GET OPPORTUNITY SEATED ANY COMMITTEE BUT I READ THE BILL AND I'M A PAIR OF. THREE CHILDREN. BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THEY ARE NOT. USING ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS BUT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT I. AT A YOUNG AGE. USEDTOBACCO AND IS VERY ADDICTING THERE'S ONE IT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST. ADDICTIONS TO STOP IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO OVERCOME THAT AND- I DO NOT WANT MY CHILDREN TO EVER- THEY EVEN EXPERIENCE IT I AND I'VE AND I'VE SHARED WITH THEM OBVIOUSLY THE DOWNFALLS OF THAT BUT I WANT TO JUST SAY I KNOW THE AUTHORS WORKED REALLY HARD ON THIS BILL BUT I WANT TO ADD SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE'RE REALLY MISSING IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND- MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BIT IS THE MARKETING OF. EDIBLES ANY OTHER KINDS OF CANNABIS IT IS RAMPANT IS THAT I FEAR THAT ACTUALLY MORE THAN I FEAR THE TOBACCO FOR- MY CHILDREN IS SOMETHING WE THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH WHOEVER I WORKED ON IT IN THE ASSEMBLY- FOR YEARS TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME WAYS TO STOP THE MARKETING OF EDIBLES- TO OUR YOUTH BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT- IT IS RARE IT IS GONNA BE THE NEXT. THING AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH- THESE VAPING PRODUCTS SO I WILL STAND WITH YOU ON THIS BILL I PURSUE YOU BRING IT FORWARD- I HOPE THAT ARE USED TO NEVER EXPERIENCES BUT I KNOW IT IS BEING TARGETED TOWARDS YOU AND I ALSO KNOW THAT CANNABIS IS WIDELY BEING TARGETED TO YOUTH AS WELL AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT AND- IT IS I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT BUT I WOULD LOVE TO BE INVOLVED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS FOR THE FUTURE SO I'LL BE SUPPORT I OR DID I VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER DAHLE. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING NONE. SENATOR HILL YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM MADAM PRESIDENT OF THREE RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE OF THIS I A RETAIL BàN RETAIL SALES BAN ON FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS ONLY IT IS NOT A INCREASED PENALTY OR FINE OR ARREST OPPORTUNITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OF A MINOR. THEY TODAY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO SMOKE IF THEY'RE UNDER TWENTY ONE I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENFORCED ANYWHERE- IF THEY HAVE THAT NO ONE'S LOOKING FOR CIGARETTES ON THEM THIS WILL CHANGE NOT NOT IN NO WAY. THE LAW IN THAT RELATIONSHIP RELATED TO THAT WE GET INTO THE POINT OF WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO GO AFTER DEAL WITH AND APPLY THIS TO RETAIL SALES. 74% OF THE TO PROP THE PRODUCTS THE FLAVOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS THAT YOU'D GET TODAY. THEY ARE GETTING FROM RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT. NOW HISTORICALLY BEFORE THEY WERE PURCHASING THIS ONLINE. AND THEY COULD DO THAT BUT YOU SUPPORTED AND VOTED FOR A BILL I HAD LAST YEAR THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THE TOOK EFFECT IN JANUARY. AND THAT IS THE RETAIL THE TREATMENT OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS. NOW THAT ARE SENT THROUGH THE POST. ON ANY FORM PURCHASED ONLINE THEY NOW IT APPLIES THE SAME WAY THAT IT APPLIES TO ALCOHOL SAY. WE DON'T HAVE A OVER ABUNDANCE OR PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL SALES TODAY GOING TO MINORS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR BY PURCHASING SO IF YOU PURCHASE AN ONLINE TOBACCO PRODUCT FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCT WHICH YOU COULD DO WHEN IT'S DELIVERED IT WILL BE CLEARLY MARKED THIS IS A TOBACCO PRODUCT. THIS PACKAGE REQUIRES AN ADULT TWENTY ONE YEARS OR OLDER TO SIGN FOR IT AND BEFORE IT'S DELIVERED SOMEONE TWENTY ONE YEARS OR OLDER HAS TO ACCEPT AND SIGN FOR JUST AS YOU DO TODAY. WITH ALCOHOL DELIVERIES AN ONLINE PURCHASES TO THAT'S HOW WE KEEP THEM FROM PURCHASE IN ONLINE IN THE RESTRICTIONS NOW APPLY AND HAVE WORKED BECAUSE BEFORE THIS THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE GETTING IT ONLINE NOW THEY'RE GETTING IT CONTINUING TO GET IT AT RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS. SO WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE THERE AND I BELIEVE WE SOLVE THE- THE ONLINE SALE OF THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS THE PROBLEM IS. THEY ARE FOR IN THESE ONLINE NOW MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES RAISE THE HOOKAH ISSUE. IF WITH- WITH HOOK UP. THE EIGHT EXEMPTION IN THIS LEGISLATION IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A HOOK UP AND I LEARNED A LOT IN THIS I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH HOW. THAT APPLIED BUT ALL WHO GO. A BACKHOE SETIA ITS FLAVOR IT IS HISTORICALLY THAT IS HOW IT IS IT IS A FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS IT IS YOU KNOW IT IS CONSUMED THROUGH A PIPE. IT'S NOT CONCEALABLE IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN WALK DOWN HE STREET WITH IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN PLUG INTO THE USB DRIVE ON YOUR COMPUTER. IT IS A VERY LARGE DEVICE IT IS ALSO THE USE OF A HOOKAH ISSUES FOR CELEBRITY- CELEBRATORY EVENTS. ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS IT'S NOT A DAILY USED PRODUCT. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S DIFFERENT. THAN ANY CIGARETTE IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE TOBACCO CIGARETTE. IS DIFFERENT THAN A VAPING DEVICE AND THAT'S WHY WE FELT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO. EXCLUDE THEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME PROBLEM IS REFINED TODAY. SO IF I COULD CONTINUE BUT MADAM PRESIDENT YOU KNOW BIG TOBCCO HAS PUT A PRICE ON OUR KIDS LIVES BUT I REFUSED TO DO SO. SB SEVEN NINETY THREE WILL BE A PUBLIC HEALTH VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA WE WILL PROTECT. AGAINST ANOTHER GENERATION GETTING ADDICTED TO THESE DEADLY PRODUCTS AND THAT TO BE IS PRICELESS. COLLEGE IT'S TIME THAT WE STAND UP FOR OUR YOUTH IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME ABOUT THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY'S INTENTIONS FOR OUR YOUTH AND TAKE THEIR WORDS AND ACTIONS INTO CONSIDERATIONS. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE PHILIP MORRIS EXECUTIVE SAID AND I QUOTE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT TEENAGE SMOKING PATTERNS AND ATTITUDES TODAY'S TEENAGERS TOMORROW'S POTENTIAL CUSTOMER. AND IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AN RJ REYNOLDS EXECUTIVE SAID QUOTE. WE DON'T SMOKE BATCH EXPLETIVE. WE JUST SELL WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SMOKE FOR THE YOUNG THE POOR THIS LACK AND THE STUPID. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR A MANUFACTURER FRUITY SNUFF SAID CHERRY SCROLL IS FOR SOMEBODY WHO LIKES THE TASTE OF CANDY. IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. JUL PURCHASED AD SPACE ON NICKELODEON TO NETWORK SEVENTEEN MAGAZINE AND EVEN EDUCATIONAL SITES FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS I IMPLORE YOU TO RECOGNIZE THIS PATTERN OF ABUSE AND RECKLESSNESS. MILLIONS OF KIDS ARE NOW ADDICTED TO NICOTINE AND YOUTH THE YOUTH VAPING EPIDEMIC WILL HAVE UNKNOWNS AND DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH. TOBACCO USE BEING THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE DEATH AND DISEASE WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES. OF A NEW GENERATION HOOKED TO NICOTINE THIRTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY DUE TO TOBACCO RELATED ILLNESSES. TO ME. THE QUESTION. IS NOT I WE SHOULD PROHIBIT THE SALE OF FLAVORED TOBACCO. RATHER I ASK WHY WE EVER ALLOWED THE MOST DEADLY SUBSTANCE ON EARTH TO HAVE A CANDY FLAVOR IN THE FIRST PLACE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL CALLING.

SENATOR BILL MOVES TO CALL COLLEAGUES WITHOUT OBJECTION WE ARE GOING TO NOW MOVE TO ASSEMBLY THIRD READING FILE ITEM EIGHTY FIVE. SENATOR GALGIANI WILL BE PRESENTING MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ELEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MULLIN AN ACT RELATING TO TAX LIMITATION. CENTER GALGIANI THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT A CA ELEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MALEN MAYES FRIEDMAN BURKE AND GREAT. AC ELEVEN IF APPROVED BY THE VOTERS WILL HELP OPEN HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES LOCKED OUT OF THE MARKET HELP SENIORS RIGHT SIZE THEIR HOUSING NEEDS AND PROVIDE VICTIMS OF WILDFIRES THE OPPORTUNITY TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES. DESPITE OUR STATE'S ECONOMIC CHALLENGES HOME PURCHASE PRICES AND RENT STATE WHY CONTINUE TO RISE FASTER THAN WAGES AS YOU KNOW AND YET BECAUSE OF THE AND FLEXIBILITY OF OUR PROPERTY TAX LAWS IN SOME CASES PEOPLE ARE FINDING THEMSELVES AND HOUSING THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FIT THEIR NEEDS THIS IS PARTICULARLY PARTICULARLY TRUE IN AREAS THAT ARE JOBS RICH AND HOUSING POOR. LIKE IN THE BAY AREA. ACA ELEVEN IS A COMPROMISE THAT WAS REACHED TO REPLACE AN ALREADY QUALIFIED BALLOT MEASURE WHICH IS L. L. ELIGIBLE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION. ACA ELEVEN STRIKES A BALANCED APPROACH THAT BENEFITS PROPERTY OWNERS WHILE CREATING A STABLE REVENUE SOURCE FOR BOTH FIRE DISTRICTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE SERVICES TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS. SPECIFICALLY ACA ELEVEN CONTINUES TO PROTECT SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES BY LIMITING PROPERTY TAX INCREASES ON PRIMARY RESIDENCES AS ORIGINALLY AND TEN INTENDED UNDER OUR LAWS. ADDITIONALLY THIS AMENDMENT EXPANDS THE SAME PROPERTY TAX PROTECTIONS TO WILDFIRE VICTIMS WHILE REMOVING THE UNFAIR LOCATION RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE BUILT INTO THE LAW. BY ALLOWING SENIORS THE DISABLED AND NOW FIRE VICTIMS TO CARRY THE BENEFITS OF PROP THIRTEEN TAX PROTECTIONS FOR ANOTHER HOME THOSE IN NEED WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE CLOSER TO FAMILY OR CLOSER TO MEDICAL CARE. TO A SENIOR OR RETIREMENT COMMUNITY OR TO REPLACE A DAMAGED HOME ANYWHERE WITHIN CALIFORNIA. AND IT WILL OPEN UP HOUSING TO FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS AND OTHERS WHO NEED MORE OPTIONS FOR HOUSING AND ONCE AGAIN SPECIFICALLY IN AREAS THAT ARE JOBS RICH AND HOUSING POOR. AGAIN AC ELEVEN IS IN NO WAY A CHANGE TO THE PROPERTY TAX OWNERS TAX PROTECTIONS PROVIDED UNDER PROP THIRTEEN. BUT WHAT IF APPROVED BY THE VOTERS CLOSE SEVERAL UNINTENDED LOOPHOLES AND PROPS FIFTY EIGHT AND ONE NINETY THREE THAT HAVE ALLOWED OUT OF STATE INVESTORS NON CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND TRUST FUND HEIRS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR CURRENT TAX LAWS. UNDER A CA ELEVEN PARENTS AND GRAND CHILDREN WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PASS THE FAMILY HOME TO THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. WITH THE PROTECTIONS OF PROPOSITION THIRTEEN ENSURING THAT THEIR HEIRS CAN AFFORD TO MOVE INTO THAT HOME AS THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE BUT THE KEY IS THAT HOME MUST BE USED AS A PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND NOT A RENTAL. NO MORE TURNING GRANDMA AND GRANDPA'S HOUSE INTO A RENTAL UNIT AND DENYING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE TAX REVENUES THEY NEED TO PROVIDE SERVICES. AND THE SURROUNDING HOMEOWNERS PAYING A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE NEEDS ACA ELEVEN BRINGS VITALLY NEEDED RESOURCES TO HISTORICALLY UNDERFUNDED FIRE DISTRICTS. AND BOTH RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES RESOURCES WILL ALSO BE DEDICATED TO CAL FIRE IN SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE RESPONSE. WHICH WILL HELP TO PROTECT MILLIONS OF HOMES AND LIVES FINALLY THE AMENDMENT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL LOCAL REVENUE TO COUNTIES CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. BY CREATING A BALANCING MECHANISM TO HELP SABILIZE PROPERTY TAX RAISE REVENUE FOR EVERY COUNTY ACROSS CALIFORNIA AT A TIME WHEN COUNTIES NEED IT MOST. ACA ELEVEN ALSO PROTECTS COUNTIES AGAINST ANY POTENTIAL REVENUE LOSS BY ESTABLISHING AN OFFSET FIND WHICH WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REVENUE PROTECTION YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT. TO ENSURE LOCAL GENERAL FUND STABILITY. THIS MEASURE IS CO SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION. THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GALGIANI DEBATER DISCUSSIONS SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU A- MADAM PRESIDENT TWO YEARS AGO. SENATOR GALGIANI INTRODUCE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. IN THIS HOUSE THAT DEALT WITH THE ISSUE THAT SHE JUST DISCUSSED PORT. OF. TAX BASIS IN YOUR HOME TWO YEARS AGO IN THIS HOUSE SENATOR HILL. INTRODUCED A MEASURE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT SENATOR HILL. TO ALLOW OR TO GET BASICALLY DEAL WITH THIS IN EQUITY THAT OCCURS WHEN FOLKS AS WAS INDICATED IN THE PRESENTATION INHERIT A PROPERTY AND DOES THAT MEAN THEY INHERIT THE TAX BASE OF THEIR GRANDPARENTS. AND HE WANTED TO CORRECT THAT THAT WAS INFORMED BY REPORT THAT CAME OUT OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THOSE TWO MEASURES IN FORM THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I WAS TRYING TO BE SOLVED BY A CA THAT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THOSE SOLUTIONS ARE QUITE ELEGANT IN TERMS OF REALLY DEALING. FOR SOMEONE SUGGEST REALLY DEALING WITH SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES BIG PICTURE CHALLENGE THE CALIFORNIA'S FACING FIRST HOUSING. WE HAVE RETIREES THAT ARE SITTING IN THEIR HOMES THAT THEY PURCHASED PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AT A VERY LOW TAX BASIS OFTEN AS IN THE CASE OF MY FAMILY THEY WON'T MOVE OUT BECAUSE- HERE SOMETIMES THE ONE PERSON IN THE HOUSE. THEY WON'T MOVE OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING ALMOST NO PROPERTY TAX AND THEY'RE NERVOUS THAT IF THEY WERE MOVED TO BUY SOMETHING NEW. THAT THE NEW TAX BASES THE COULD BEFORE THE TAX BILL. THIS WILL BE ON TOLD RESULT IN THE SALE OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW HOMES WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS FAMILIES ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN THOSE HOMES OFTEN ONLY HAVE ONE OR TWO PEOPLE IN THEIR RETIREES PEOPLE THAT WANT TO MOVE. AS WAS INDICATED IN THE OPENING REMARKS THE WHOLE NOTION ABOUT WORKING CLOSER. TO YOUR WORKPLACE AND FREEING UP THOSE HOUSES WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH A HOUSING CRISIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. DELIVERABLE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE DEBATE HERE ON THIS FLOOR. SECOND THE IDEA THAT WE'RE PROTECTING SENIORS IS A HUGE ELEMENT THAT IS FINDS ITSELF WITHIN THE JURISPRUDENTIAL CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE HERE ACROSS THIS FOR. THIRD WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SEEN THIS IN SO MANY COMMUNITIES REPRESENTED BY SENATORS ACROSS THIS FLOOR WHERE THINGS ARE BURNING DOWN THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE THE CLIMATE CHANGE SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THIS MEASURE IS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO FUND THOSE FIRE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATELY TREATED BECAUSE THE POST PROP THIRTEEN OR THEY HAVE EVEN HALF PROBLEMS OR THE LIKE AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS TO CREATE THIS MEASURE WHAT THE AUTHOR AND MISTER HILL HAVE DONE AND MISTER MULLIN. TOGETHER WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS HOUSE IN THE BRILLIANT STAFF OF THE PROTEST MOVE WORKED THEIR HEARTS OUT ON THIS THING. IS TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS APPROPRIATE REVENUE STREAMS FOR THOSE FIREFIGHTERS AND THAT'S JUST NOT PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. THAT'S ALSO VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS. THAT BASICALLY A PROFESSIONAL WISE ENOUGH AND- OFFER SUPPORT FOR THEM. SO WE'RE DEALING WITH THAT. FOR THE OR THIRD OR FOURTH AMEND LOST MY COUNT HERE BUT THE POINT IS. THAT THE POINT IS THAT WE ALSO HAVE THIS PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC SAFETY WHAT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO. RE EXAMINE THAT ISSUE HERE. ON THIS FLOOR IN IN THIS LEGISLATURE. FIREFIGHTERS ARE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THAT PUBLIC SAFETY DELIVERY. NOT JUST ON THE HEALTH STUFF BUT WE SEE IN THE DEBATES WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE. OF PARA MEDICINE ON THIS FLOOR ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE INVOLVED IN BRINGING FOLKS TO MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES ARE FOLKS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY. DRUG ADDICTION ALL OF WHICH ARE PART OF THE- ARCHITECTURE OF PUBLIC SAFETY SO WE'RE DEALING WITH PUBLIC SAFETY WE'RE DEALING WITH HOUSING. WE'RE DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IT IN IN THIS MEASURE. AND IT'S IS I WOULD SUGGEST. QUITE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE IS A COMPETING MEASURE ON THE BALLOT TODAY. TODAY ARM AND THE IDEA. I'M YEARS AGO COMPROMISED THAT BROUGHT BACK THE NOTION OF THE INDIRECT INITIATIVE INTERCONNECTION OF CRATES A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND PROPONENTS OF BILLS THE IDEA IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A DISCUSSION AND NEGOTIATION OFTEN WHERE WE DEAL WITH LARGER PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES AND WHAT HAPPENS HERE TODAY'S RESULTS IF THIS MEASURE GETS OFF THIS FLOOR AND OUT OF THE OTHER HOUSE IS WE WILL I AM HOPING RESULT IN PULLING THAT MEASURE OFF ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SAVING TAXPAYER DOLLARS AS OF HAVING TO MEASURES. CREATING A COMPROMISE THAT REALLY ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE THAT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF TIMING THOSE NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOMEWHAT IMPEDED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC TO THE GO SHADE UNDER THE PRINCIPLES OF THIS INDIRECT INITIATIVE I SUGGEST I REALLY WANT TO STRESS THE ISSUE OF COSTS NO STRESS THE ISSUE THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC WITH RESPECT TO THE. DISCUSSIONS WERE HAVING HERE TODAY. POURTANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SO I JUST WANT TO. CONGRATULATE THE- BOTH SENATORS IN THERE FOR SIDE ON THIS AND PROVIDING THE FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWS US TO MOVE FORWARD TODAY HOPEFULLY IN AN EFFORT TO DEAL WITH VERY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THE GET CALIFORNIA IS FACING IN IS I LOVE TO ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY IN A VERY ELEGANT WAY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG THE SHOW NEAL. NOT A LETTERS YOU DEVON SENATE I URGE THE NOBLE. THIS WILL NOT A- WHAT I THINK SOME. INTENDED THAT THE MIGHT ACCOMPLISH FACILITATE GREATER UP TO PASS THINGS ON CHILDREN I ARE THE OPPOSITE. THIS LEGISLATURE FOR THAT DIDN'T ADDRESS. THE OPPRESSIVE INCREASE OF PROPERTY TAXES. MONACO HOMEOWNERS. AND THEY WERE MATT. AND THE BECAUSE THIS PLACE DID NOT. SERVE THEIR INTERESTS PROPOSITION THIRTEEN OVERWHELMINGLY SECURED A PLACE ON THE BALLOT. WELL AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED THE LEGISLATURE WALK UP ALL MY GOSH THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE WELL WE'VE GOT A WHOLE LOT AS WE'RE NOW ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE. THAT WAS CALLED SENATE BILL ONE. AND THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE GREAT ANSWER. AND STOP PROPOSITION THIRTEEN WELL GUESS WHAT. PROP ONE SB ONE. WHAT DOWN IN FLAMES PROP THIRTEEN STORMED THE LAND. AND HAS BEEN PRESERVED EVERY YEAR CENTS. NOTWITHSTANDING ALMOST EVERY YEAR TAX. AT TAX NOT TA X. BUT THE TAX ON PROP THIRTEEN TO GET RID OF IT BECAUSE WHY. WHICH IS AN ELEMENTAL PURPOSE OF THIS. LEGISLATION AND TO THE DEGREE THAT INITIALLY MORE MONEY FOR GOVERNMENT. MORE MONEY FOR GOVERNMENT. AND THAT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. JUST CONFIRM THAT IN THEIR LETTER AND THEY USE A NEW VOTE WORDS NEW BOLD WORDS NET REVENUE INCREASE. SOME WOULD CALL AT TEXAS. AND THEY WANT TO HAVE CITIES TO BE KEPT HOLE. WHEN FOLKS MOVE AWAY. WELL WHAT IF FOLKS MOVE AWAY BECAUSE OF CITIES. ARE NOT PROVIDING. THE SAY FOR AFFORDABLE HABITAT SO THEY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. OF COURSE THEY DO. BUT WE WANT TO KEEP THOSE WHOLE. NOW I NOBODY HAS BEEN A GREATER CHAMPION. OF THE CALYX OVER A CAREER THAN I HAVE I KNOW THE PLIGHT OF THE COUNTIES OF REPRESENTED NINETEEN UP. THEY ALWAYS HAVE HAD PROBLEMS. BECAUSE WHAT. THEY SUFFER THE ONEROUS BURDENS OF STATE AND FEDERAL MANDATES. FAR BEYOND WHAT CITIES EVER SUFFER. AND THEY HAVE MUCH FEWER OPPORTUNITIES TO REYES AND SECURE REVENUES. THEN THE CITY'S SO MY HEART IS ALWAYS BEEN WITH THE COUNTY. AND IT'S ALWAYS WITH SIX SESSION. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO IN OUR LIVES. A CREW SOMETHING PARTICULARLY IN THEIR CHARACTER THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR BEING AND THEIR VALUES TO OUR CHILDREN BUT ALSO SOME OF THE PROPERTY THAT WE HAVE ACCUMULATED. NOW THIS IS A FALSE HOPE. BECAUSE IF YOU ARE GOING TO THEN INHERIT MOTHER AND FATHER'S PROPERTY pHOW MANY CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO THE LIVE IN THAT HOUSE. AND HOW MANY FAMILIES HAVE ONLY ONE CHILD. TO INHERIT THAT HOUSE. MY OWN INDUSTRY BOREDOM THAT'S WHY BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE SAME FEAR. AT THE SAME THIS LOOMING OUT THERE. BUT HOW MANY OF THEIR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO LIVE ON THAT HOUSE AND STAY ON THAT FARM. SADLY TODAY FOR MANY REASONS AT ALL NOT EVEN THE LABOR WITH YOU. THAT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN. SO WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM. BUT LET'S JUST CONSIDER WHAT IS REALLY HERE THIS IS ABOUT MORE MONEY FOR GOVERNMENT TO SPEND. DO THEY HAVE OTHER RESOURCES WELL HECK YEAH THERE'S SOME MONEY IN THIS VERY BUDGET. AND I COMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING IT THERE. THE RECOMPENSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTICULARLY COUNTIES LADIES AND GENTLEMAN HAS NEVER HAD THE STATE KEEP IT SHORT WITH ONE EXCEPTION. TRIAL COURT FUNDING THE STATE OVER DECADES DID KEEP ITS WORD. ON RECOMPENSE IN THEM THE LOST TRIAL COURT FUNDING EVERYTHING ELSE NO. THIS RENEGES. THIS IS A FALSE HOPE A FALSE PROMISES A POLITICAL. THE HEAD OFTEN INITIATIVE THAT IS QUALIFIED AND AS FAR AS THE BORDER THAT REALTORS HAVE C. A. R. I THINK THEY SHOULD TALK TO SOME OF THEIR MEMBERS. THERE LISTENING I GUESS TO THEIR LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE AND THE EMINENT WISDOM OF PEOPLE WHO INHABIT SACRAMENTO. BUT I'VE BEEN AROUND THE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT THOSE REAL ACTORS ARE NOT SEEN OLD BOY THIS IS GREAT. THERE SAY AND WHAT. THEY DID WHAT. I URGE A NO VOTE. SENATOR HILL. AND I RISE IN SUPPORT AND WITH MY COLLEAGUE- FROM THE VALLEY AND CERTAINLY THE HARD WORK OF OUR GOOD FRIEND THE SENATOR FROM SAN FERNANDO VALLEY IN CRAFTING AND WORKING THROUGH THIS THIS ACA. THE INTENT OF MY SCA THREE EARLIER LAST YEAR WAS TO KIND OF CLOSE A LOOPHOLE AND EVEN JOHN TO PAUL FROM OF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY WHEN I INTRODUCED THIS THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE HE SAID UP THINK THE WORDS WERE THAT MAKES SENSE SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT BECAUSE THAT WASN'T THE INTENT OF PROP THIRTEEN TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO INHERIT THE FRONT THE GOAL WAS IF YOU'RE A PARENT PERHAPS LIVING IN THAT HOME A CHILD LIVING IN THAT HOME FROM YOUR PARENTS OR YOUR GOING TO INHERIT THAT HOME AT THEIR DEATH. IT GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAY IN THAT HOME WITHOUT HAVING IT BE REASSESSED AND REQUIRING YOU PERHAPS TO MOVE BECAUSE YOUR CURRENT INCOME DID NOT SUPPORT THAT REASSESSMENT COST TO THAT WAS THE GOAL OF PROP THIRTEEN AND THIS HAS BEEN AYE BLOOM ABUSED BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS OF OWNING THE PROPERTY RATING IT FOR A LARGE AMOUNT AND THEN NOT PAYING THE- TESTAMENT THAT- IT WAS IT'S VALUED TODAY SO THERE'S A WINNER BUT THERE'S A WIN THERE I BELIEVE WIN FOR TAXPAYERS. IN THIS DOESN'T BENEFIT THE TAXPAYERS BUT ALSO STILL PRESERVED I BELIEVE THE REGIONAL INTENT OF PROP THIRTEEN WHICH IS ALLOWED THOSE THOSE CHILDREN THOSE PEOPLE WHO INHERIT THOSE THOSE PROPERTIES TO BE ABLE TO THAT TO LIVE IN THERE AND RESIDE IN THOSE PROPERTIES AT THAT TIME IT'S ALSO A GREAT WIN FOR THE COUNTIES AND FOR THOSE SENIORS WHEN A SENIOR LEAVES AND IS ABLE TO PORT OF THE ORDER MOVE THEIR ASSESSMENT TO ANOTHER LOCATION AS IN MANY COUNTIES TODAY ALREADY ALLOW. THAT'S A GREATOPPORTUNITY THAT IS A. WIN FOR THEM. NOW THE PROPERTY WILL THEN BE RESOLD. AND PROBABLY BE. AT A HIGHER WE WILL BRING IN REVENUE TO COUNTIES THAT THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM I CAN'T SEE A LOSS IN THIS AT ALL. I SEE ALSO THAT THE INITIATIVE THAT WILL GO ON THE BALLOT WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE OF THIS AND BECAUSE OF THAT. THAT INHERITANCE ASPECT OF IT IN THE OTHER PARTS OF THIS THIS IS- INITIATIVE SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT ACA ELEVEN. I THINK THIS IS THAT ELEGANT SOLUTION TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS TO OUR RESIDENTS AND CITIZENS AND ENABLE THE TAX SYSTEM TO REALLY WORK AS INTENDED IT TO BE. THANK YOU. SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION WANT TO THANK CENTERS GALGIANI IN HELL FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS I CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK THE MAJORITY LEADER WHO. IN HIS INTELLIGENCE AND INSIGHT HAD HAS WORKED TOGETHER WITH ALL OF YOU TO CRAFT THIS ELEGANT- RESOLUTION NOT THAT I THINK HAS ONLY WINTERS REALLY ONLY WINNERS ARE SENIORS HUGE WINNERS THE ABILITY TO SELL THEIR HOME IN AND BUY A NEW ONE AND NOT BE FACED WITH HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES ARE FIRE COMMUNITY BOTH CAL FIRE AND ALL OF OUR RURAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS HEAVY ENORMOUS BENEFITS FROM THIS THOSE WHO ARE SKEPTICAL OF GOVERNMENT. AND TAXES AND SPENDING SHOULD LIKE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IT SHOWS EXACTLY WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING. EXACTLY WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING. FOR FIRE PROTECTION. AND THAT'S GOING TO BENEFIT OUR GENERAL FUND THAT'S GOING TO BENEFIT OUR SAFETY AND SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS SO I RISE TO SUPPORT THIS COULD MEASURE THE REALTORS ARE RUNNING AROUND TRYING TO RAISE PEOPLE'S TAXES ON THEIR HOMES- THERE ARE TRYING TO VIOLATE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS THEIR SPONSORSHIP ALONG WITH THE FIRE- ASSOCIATION I THINK MAKES IT CLEAR THIS IS AN ARTFUL COMPROMISE WORTHY OF SUPPORT. AND I REGION I. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY. FOLLOW BY SENATOR BATES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I. BUT NOT OFTEN AT ODDS WITH MY- GOOD FRIEND FROM TO HEMA BUT TODAY I AM ON THIS ISSUE. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS AS A FARMER NUMBER ONE WHO WOULD NOT HAVE THE FARM IF IT WASN'T FOR PROP THIRTEEN. BECAUSE ORIGINALLY THE VALUES WOULD'VE BEEN SET AT WHAT LAND CELLS NEXT TO FOUR SO I AM VERY IS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART THAT WE- TECH THOSE ABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO. PASS THAT LAND ON. A AND USE A PROP THIRTEEN WHICH I LOVE. BUT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION NUMBER ONE THERE IS A QUALIFIED. BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT'S ON THAT- IN MY IN MY OPINION IS NOT A GOOD PIECE OF LEGISLATION ARE GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA TO VOTE ON I THINK IT WOULD IT WOULD I KNOW WOULD DAMAGE. THE AGRICULTURE AND IF YOU'LL IF YOU'VE NOTICED IN YOUR ANALYSIS THAT THE FARM BUREAU HAS SUPPORTED THIS. PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT DOES PROTECT THE FAMILY FARM AND THE AND THE THOSE WHO HAVE THE PROP THIRTEEN GUYS THE OTHER THING THAT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION DOES IS ALLOW YOU. TO MOVE YOUR VALUE OF YOUR PROP THIRTEEN. IF YOU SO CHOOSE TO WANT TO MOVE. IT ALSO. FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD TOTAL COMMUNITIES BURNED OUT. IT'S GOING TO HAVE THE ABILITY IF YOU LOSE YOUR ON THE FIRE YOU KNOW THAT SAME ABILITY AS WELL. SO FOR THOSE THREE REASONS THOSE ARE THE REASONS THAT I'M SUPPORTING THIS- BILL AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I HAVEN'T REALLY DECIDED ON THIS BILL IT HAS SOME GOOD THINGS BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT ARE TROUBLING IN TERMS OF THE AFFORDABILITY AFFORDABILITY ASPECT THAT COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED OUR WITH THE BILL LAND OF THE PROPERTY CHANGES HANDS. SO YOU H HAVE A HOME- YOU PASS AWAY CHILDREN IN HERE AT IT THEY'VE GOT THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY TAX WITH THE CAN'T MOVE IN SO THEY DECIDE THEY WANT TO RENDON BATCH OF THE THEY'RE NOT LIVING IN IT THE TAP ON IT ARE GOING TO BE REASSESSED ITS CURRENT VALUE AT THE TIME THAT IT IS SOLD. SO THE RANSOMED OUT FOR WHOMEVER YOU KNOW IT'S NOW TO ARE GOING TO PAY A HIGHER RAMPS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA AND MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES. THAT I REPRESENT MORE THAN MEDIAN. COST OF A HOME OR THAT. ALL RIGHT AROUND SAY EIGHT HOW NINE DOLLARS. AND I BELIEVE IS REFER IN NORTHERN NOW CAN IS ON AND THE- BOB AREAS. SECONDLY I'M A SENIOR YOU GUYS I SO MY BECAUSE CAPITAL GAINS TO. ON MY HOME WOULD PROVE ME FOR BUYING. WITH THE PROCEEDS OPT HOME THAT IS EQUAL TO IN TERMS OF WHAT I WOULD BE LOOKING FOR. THE TAX STRUCTURE IN THE STATE AND CERTAINLY IN THE NATION WHEN IT LOOKS AT PROPERTY IS SIGNIFICANT. LEAVE BEHIND THE TIMES IN TERMS OF. OUR MOBILITY AND I THINK YOU NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IN TERMS OF THIS CITY IS GOING TO BE A PROPERTY TAX INCREASE. FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. AND IF WE WANT TO HELP WITH MOBILITY SOME OF THE TAXES THAT WE PUT ON. THE BACKS OF PEOPLE WANTING TO MOVE. OF TWENTY TO BUY OR ARE SIGNIFICANT AND I THINK OF A DEEPER LOOK ASSESS OF WHAT THIS REALLY DOES. IT REALLY HELPS- IS ESSENTIAL BEFORE. IT REALLY SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY. PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS REALLY REALLY. KIND OF A MIXED. DOESN'T DOESN'T GET ME THERE AND I'M SURE WHEN IT GETS ON THE BALLOT IN THE ARGUMENTS OF A MERGE. OF THE BE A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE AND THE FACT THAT SENIORS WHO HAVE ACQUIRED. SOME SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY ASSETS HAVE TO STAY THERE BECAUSE OF WHAT'S TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM AND CERTAINLY WHAT COULD BE PASSED ON TO THEIR CHILDREN. WHO MIGHT REALLY NEED THOSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT THIS TIME IN OUR ECONOMY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR GALGIANI MY CLOTHES I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE BY THANKING SENATOR HERTZBERG AND SENATOR HILL SENATOR HILL FOR YOUR VISION OF CLOSING THE GAP AND FINDING THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR COMING UP WITH A MECHANISM FOR STABILIZING THE REVENUE AND SENATOR HILL TO YOUR- COMMENTS ABOUT THE FORMER POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. HIS QUOTE IS THIS INITIATIVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PROP THIRTEEN IN FACT IT STRENGTHENS PROP THIRTEEN FOR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF SENIORS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND WILD FIRE VICTIMS AND TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FOUND FROM THE NORTH WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITANCE TAX THIS REPEALS THE PARENT CHILD GRANDPARENT GRANDCHILD EXCLUSION. BUT UP TO A MILLION DOLLARS IN AGGREGATE VALUE OF ALL OTHER TYPES OF PROPERTY- SECONDLY WITH REGARD TO ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR THE STATE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES A BALANCING MECHANISM WITH TWO DIFFERENT WANT FRIENDS ONE IS THE COUNTY REVENUE PROTECTION FIND IN THE EVENT THAT A COUNTY COMES UP SHORT BECAUSE OF A MOVE AND SECONDLY THE CALIFORNIA FIRE RESPONSE FIND. AND IT IS VERY SPECIFIC THAT A COUNTY WHO ENDS UP HAVING OF ADDITIONAL REVENUE COMING AND IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ANY OF THESE FUNDS AT ALL IT'S ONLY FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT COME UP SHORT THIS IDEA WAS BORN OUT OF THE PROBLEM THAT THIS LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE THROUGH TWO THOUSAND. WHEN SENATOR TORE LOOKS AND WAS HERE AND WE WERE STARTING TO HAVE THE JOBS HOUSING IMBALANCE WHEN WE HAD A GROWING NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY COMMUTING IT USED TO BE AN HOUR AND A HALF TO DRIVE FOR ME FROM SAN FRANCISCO HOME AND VICE VERSA IT IS NOW THREE FOUR. FIVE DURING. SENATOR TOILET BUT A BILL THAT WOULD CREATED FINE. FOR CREATING ADDITIONAL JOE AND HOUSING FOR AREA. AND ALSO A HOMES AND JOB RICH AREAS THAT BILL PASSED WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR BUT THEN WE HAD THE DOT COM CRASH AND THE REVENUE WASN'T AVAILABLE SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE. AND AGAIN THIS THIS BILL WAS BORN OUT OF THE IDEA THAT IF WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THESE INE COUNTY BAY AREA AS REGIONAL AREA THAT ARE RETIRING AND DON'T NEED TO BE WORKING LIVING IN EIGHT. JOBS RICH AREA ANY LONGER AND WHO ARE WANTING TO MOVE INTO SLOWER PACED ENVIRONMENT OR NEAR THEIR CHILDREN OR WE CUT TERMINATE COMMUNITY. OR FOR THAT MATTER THERE WANTING TO MOVE OUT OF THEIR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CONDO AND MOVED TO SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY TO A HOME FOR THE SAME PRICE ON A LAKE IT WOULD GIVE THEM THAT ABILITY. AND THEN FREE UP THOSE HOMES AND THE JOBS WHICH AREAS SO THAT THOSE WHO ARE WORKING AND REALLY NEED TO LIVE THERE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER. ALL DEBATE SAY MADAM SIR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN. ARCHULETA I ATKINS I BATES NO BELL I BORDERS BRADFORD HI CABALLERO I CHIANG. DALLY FIVE DODD. FIVE TORONTO.

SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY TWO BY SENATOR PAN AND ACTUALLY DID TO HEALTH CARE SENATOR PAN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO REQUIRES A STATE CONTRACTOR PARTNER TO MANUFACTURE INSULIN TEN OTHER GENERIC DRUGS WITH THE INTENT THAT THESE DRUGS BE MADE WIDELY AVAILABLE THERE FOR SURE AND WE HAVE A RELIABLE COST EFFECTIVE SUPPLY OF GENERIC MEDICATIONS. THIS POLICIES MORE PORN ENDEAVORS THE COVE IN NINETEEN FRONT PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT GLARING GAPS AND SUPPLIES OF ESSENTIAL DRUGS MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SUPPLIES WE WITNESS THIS WITH PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT VENTILATORS BASED MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO SWABS IN TUBES NECESSARY FOR TESTING AND EVEN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS- PERHAPS ONE EXAMPLE WAS HYDROCHLORIC WHEN WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY TOUTED BY SOME AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT TO OTHER NO LONGER- BUT- PATIENTS WHO ACTUALLY DEPEND ON THE STRUGGLE AT LUPUS AND ARTHRITIS ACTUALLY HAD DIFFICULTY OBTAINING YET. IN AREAS SUCH AS- AN AREAS IN THE COUNTRY WHICH WERE PARTICULARLY HARD HIT BACK OF A NINETEEN THERE WERE REPORTS OF POSSIBLE LOW RUNNING LOW ON DRUGS NECESSARY FOR INTUBATION INCLUDING MUSCLE RELAX AND- AS DRUGS ARE DEFINED AS- AS EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR COVER NINETEEN PATIENTS IT'S LIKELY DOBIE SUPPLY ISSUES FOR THOSE DRUGS AS WELL. SO IN ADDITION TO INCREASING COMPETITION LOWERING PRICES IN ADDRESSING SHORTAGES SETTING UP A STRUCTURE WHICH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ITS OWN DRUG MANUFACTURING CAPACITY WILL HELP PREPARE TO STATE FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN DEBATER DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SENATOR MORE LAW. SACRAMENTO PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES- THIS IS ANOTHER. BILL THAT ENCOURAGES IS DRIFT FROM WHAT IS THE MAIN PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT. OBTAINING AFFORDABLE DRUGS WHILE ADMIRABLE IS NOT THE CORE FUNCTION. OF STATE GOVERNMENTS WHY ADD MORE EMPLOYEES WITH THE RESULTING EXPENSIVE PENSION PLANS AND OTHER BENEFITS FAR EXCEEDING WHAT IS OFFERED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO THE STATE'S PAYROLL. SINCE THERE IS NO BUT IN THE ANALYSIS ALL WE CAN ASSUME IS THAT THIS NEW DEPARTMENT WILL SELL MANUFACTURE GENERIC PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AT A FAIR PRICE. ONE HAS TO ASSUME THAT THE PRICE IS HIGHER THAN THE COST TO MANUFACTURE PLUS OVERHEAD. BUT IT SEEMS TO BE SILENT ON WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE AN EXCESS INVENTORY. IS IT SOLD BELOW COST THIS IS THE STATE SUBSIDIZE THE LOS IS THIS A FOR PROFIT ENDEAVOR LIKE AN ENTERPRISE FUND. AND HARPER PROFITS HANDLED SHOULD THEY OCCUR. I WOULD APPRECIATE THE BUSINESS PLAN IN THE OFFICE CLOSING REMARKS AND IN THE MEANTIME UNDER THE FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD RECOMMEND DEFERRING SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LARGE SENATOR SKINNER. MADAM PRESIDENT A MEMBER SO I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND I WOULD JUST POINT OUT I THINK MANY OF US FEEL THAT A VERY FUNDAMENTAL ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT OUR CONSUMERS AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND THE INCREDIBLE PRICE INCREASES OR JUST THE PRICES THAT AMERICANS FACE COMPARED TO CANADIANS AND EVERY OTHER OECD COUNTRIES. YOU GOTTA WONDER WHAT'S WRONG AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT ESSENTIAL LIFESAVING DRUGS LIKE THOSE THAT DIABETICS NEED WHICH ANYONE CAN CHECK AND SEE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HOW THEIR ASTRONOMICAL RICE. SO I THINK A IF A DEPARTMENT LIKE THIS. WOULD COULD RESULT IN GIVING. RELIEF TO THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO PAY OUT REGIS PRICES FOR THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THEN WE WOULD BE DOING A GREAT SERVICE AS THE STATE GOVERNMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING ON SENATOR PAN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I FIRST OF ALL I WOULD POINT OUT THAT. ANY OF THESE DRUGS. ARE DRUGS IN WHICH- PEOPLE'S LIVES DEPEND ON THEM- AND- FOR EXAMPLE INSULIN IF YOU'RE A DIE BACKING OF INSULIN YOU WILL DIE. SO ASSURING THAT WE HAVE A RELIABLE SUPPLY IS CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT OR OTHER MEDICATIONS WELL WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD DINNER MEDICATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SEVERE SHORTAGE BECAUSE- UNFORTUNATELY ECONOMICS DID NOT ALLOW FOR LIABLE SUPPLIES SO. BUT TONIGHT SO- THERE'S A DRUG THAT BASICALLY STE USED TREATING- LEUKEMIA THAT WAS IN SHORT SUPPLY AND THERE WAS A CHALLENGES TRYING TO PROVIDE LEUKEMIA TREATMENTS FOR CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THAT- WITH THAT OTHER OCCASIONS AS WELL AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE ALSO EXPERIENCED. AND SEEN STORIES ABOUT MEDICATIONS AND WHICH- MAYBE IT'S GONE DOWN THE ONE MANUFACTURER AND HEDGE FUND MANAGER DECIDES TO BUY THAT COMPANY AND JACK UP THE PRICES SO- I THINK WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLES AS WELL. AND NOW IT AND SO KNOWING THAT- AN ENTITY LIKE THE STATE- MIGHT ENTER SUCH A MARKETS- WOULD ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM TRYING TO ENGAGE IN THIS KIND OF PREDATORY BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY PATIENTS WHO ARE DEPEND ON THESE DRUGS HAVE NO CHOICE BUT ALSO POINT OUT THE BILL ACTUALLY ACCESS TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE- THE VIABILITY OF THIS IDEA AND TO LOOK INTO SOME OF THE TAIL SO WHY APPRECIATE- MY GOOD FRIEND FROM COSTA MESA ASKING FOR THE BUSINESS PLAN PART OF THE- BILL. IS ACTUALLY TO DO JUST THAT SO I HOPE YOU WILL VOTE FOR THE BILL SO WE CAN. HAVE THAT PLAN WHICH THEN WE WILL CRAFTING TO FURTHER LEGISLATION IF WE CHOOSE TO BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE GATHER- TO MOVE FURTHER IN THIS DIRECTION AND IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION. SO THAT I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WELL DEBATE HAVING SAY. MADAM SIR. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE PROJECT FOR NO ALLEN. YEAH I ARE. I AT. I PLEASE. NO BELL I FORGES.

HERTZBERG HI ALL EYES THIRTY ONE KNOWS NINE THE MEASURE PASSES COLLEAGUES WERE GONNA JUMP BACK TO ASSEMBLY THIRD READING NOW JUST A LITTLE EXERCISE TO KEEP US OLD NIMBLE HERE. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO FILE ITEM EIGHTY FOUR. WHICH IS A CA FOR BY SENATOR MULLIN IT WILL BE PRESENTED BY SENATOR UMBERG. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR BIAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTIONS SENATOR UMBERG THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES LET ME KNOW YOU BEGIN BY COMPLIMENTING ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MULLIN AND LOW- EACH OF THEM HAD- COMPETING MEASURES TO ALLOW SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO VOTE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. AFTER A LOT OF HARD WORK ON EACH OTHER PARTS THEY CAME TOGETHER AND COMPROMISED ON A CA FOR WHAT DO YOU SEE FOUR DOES IS IT ALLOWS SOMEONE WHO TURNS EIGHTEEN BY THE NOVEMBER ELECTION TO BE ABLE TO VOTE IN THE PRIMARY OR CAUCUS. THAT'S ALL IT DOES IN A PLACES THIS BEFORE THE SELECT THE VOTERS. WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK SOMEONE WHO TURNS EIGHTEEN. BY THE GENERAL ELECTION DATE SHOULD BUILD A VOTE IN THE PRIMARY- RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THE YOUTH POPULATION IS THE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUT OF ANY AGE DEMOGRAPHIC TURN OUT FOR ELIGIBLE. YOUNG VOTERS IS ONLY TWENTY SEVEN POINT 5% FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION WAS ONLY TWENTY SEVEN POINT 5% FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY PRIMARY ELECTION YOUNG PEOPLE- MADE UP ONLY FOURTEEN POINT 5% OF THE POPULATION EXCUSE ME THEY MADE UP FOURTEEN POINT 5% OF POPULATION BUT ONLY SIX POINT 3% OF THOSE. VOTED AC FOUR WOULD CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO ENGAGE EARLY ON. EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS FOR LIFELONG PARTICIPATION. IN OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS- THIS IS NOT EXACTLY CUTTING EDGE IF WE ADOPT THIS OF THE VOTERS ADOPT THIS. IN NOVEMBER WE WOULD BE. ARE AMONG THE ALMOST HALF THE STATES THAT ALREADY ALLOWED SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO VOTE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION IF THEY TURN EIGHTEEN BY THE ELECTION DATE- THIS IS A- MEASURE THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR LIFE LONG ENGAGEMENT. URGENT AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR NIELSEN. THAT A PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE SENATE YOU KNOW THAT VOTING AGE USED TO BE TWENTY ONE. AND FOR ALL THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN POSED NOW. WE'RE GONNA TAKE EIGHTEEN. AND THE MANY ENSURING YEARS WHAT HAS HAPPENED HOW DOES A USEFUL VOTERS GOTTEN MORE ENGAGED. OBVIOUSLY NOT THE STATISTICS. A TERRIBLE. THERE MAY BE CERTAIN REASONS I'D ARGUE THAT TO HAND K. TWELVE EDUCATION OUR CIVIC EDUCATION JUST ABOUT NONEXISTENT. WE'RE NOT MOTIVATING THEM THOSE YOUTH. GIVING THEM GOOD REASONS UNDERSTAND OR PARTICIPATE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT SHOWING THEM WHAT OPPORTUNITIES DO EXIST AND WHAT THAT INCREDIBLE. RIGHT TO VOTE REALLY MEANS HOW SACRED IT IS. I WOULD THAT MORE HER TRAVEL TO ANOTHER COUNTRY SHOULD DO NOT HAVE THIS AND I HAVE. IT WAS IN INDIA. THE YEAR THAT INDIRA GANDHI THE PRIME MINISTER IMPOSED HER EMERGENCY POWERS AND SUSPENDED BOATING. AND THAT HUGE NATION. TRAVEL THE VILLAGES OF INDIA. THE PEOPLE WERE NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THEIR PLIGHT THE HEALTH THE POVERTY. THEY WERE MAD THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO VOTE. BUT YOU COME BACK TO AMERICA. AND EVEN OUR ADULTS. OUR COMPLACENT. TAKES A LOT EVEN GET THEM OUT TO VOTE. BACK TO THE YOUTH. I WOULD PROTECT THE- TWO YEARS HENCE. FOUR YEARS HENCE WE LOOK AT THIS BOTH THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS. DID THEY COME SWARMING INTO THE POLLS. I WOULD HOPE SO. BUT I DOUBT IT. AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE ASIDE TO THIS. YOU KNOW HERE IN MANY AREAS IN TERMS OF PROTECTING OUR YOUNGER CITIZENS. IT'S SUCH THINGS AS A DRIVING. WE'RE ELEVATING THE AGE. THAT THEY NEED MORE MATURITY. MORE EXPERIENCE. THOSE SAME POINTS LADIES AND GENTLEMAN APPLY HERE. ONE THING ABOUT THIS GENERATION. MAYBE IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT TOO EASY FOR. I ARGUED IT WAS TOO EASY FOR MY GENERATION. AND I ACTUALLY MISSED THE GREATEST GENERATION BY YOURSELF. BUT I ALWAYS SAID THAT MY PARENTS FAILED ME THEY WERE THE PRODUCT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. AND THEY VOWED THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER SO SUFFER AND SO THEY MADE IT TOO EASY FOR US. WELL MY DAD DIDN'T MAKE IT EASIER FOR ME BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY AND I'VE ALWAYS THANKED HIM FOR THAT. BUT ALSO APPRECIATED THE MATURITY AND WISDOM. GROWING UP WITH MORE RESPONSIBILITIES. AND NOW THEN I THINK MYSELF I'M GUILTY WITH MY OWN CHILDREN OF BEING TOO GOOD TO THEM. MAKING THINGS TOO EASY ON THEM. LIFE EXPERIENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU LEARN. FROM YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE. IT AGAIN THE ABJECT IN ATTENTION. OF OUR KILL CHILDREN TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SURROUND THEM THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT MEANS TO THEM. IT'S SAD. SO I HAVE DEDICATED MYSELF TO MENTORING THAT'S MY SMALL CONTRIBUTION CHILD BY CHILD. BUT HERE I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO ANY GOOD. TO MOTIVATE TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO SHOW UP AT ANY GREATER. BREAK THE POLLS IN THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS. I HATE TO SAY IT BUT- I GUESS IT'S BROKEN LET'S LEAVE IT BROUGHT. READY SENATOR BORGIAS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I KINDA LOOKED AT THIS. PROPOSITION AND IT HARKENS BACK TO OF A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES WHERE I'M SCRATCHING MY HEAD ASKING FOR. A DEFINITION WHAT IS AN ADULT. NORMALLY YOU TRIBUTE ADULT HOOD TO A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND BY VIRTUE OF THAT YOU HAVE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES. NORMALLY I THINK IT'S CITY CALIFORNIA WE DETERMINE AN ADULT TO BE EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE. THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A DEGREE OF CONSISTENCY. ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS WHEN INDIVIDUAL BUT- A MATURE AGE OF EIGHTEEN THAT ALONG WITH THOSE OPPORTUNITIES COME RESPONSIBILITIES. BUT IF YOU INVENTORY AL ALL OVER THE BOARD WE ARE AS A STATE MSG OTHER STATES ARE THE SAME WAY THAT YOU MUST BE TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE TO DRINK. YOU DON'T GET TO DRINK SIX MONTHS OR A FEW MONTHS BEFORE YOU HIT TWENTY ONE BECAUSE YOU'RE THAT CLOSE. YOU GET TO BE EIGHTEEN YEARS THE GAMBLE OR TWENTY ONE OF ITS IN A CASINO DEPENDING ON THE STATE. YOU DON'T GET TO WALK IN TO A GAMBLING OPERATION IF YOU'RE A FEW MONTHS AWAY FROM EIGHTEEN. YOU HAVE TO BE TWENTY ONE TO BUY CIGARETTES. WE HAVE TO BE EIGHTEEN TO JOIN THE MILITARY CAN POSSIBLY RISK YOUR LIFE. IN THE PROCESS. IT WAS FUN GOING WITH ALL THIS IS THAT IF WE HAVE A RANGE BETWEEN. YOU KNOW. EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE WHAT IS THE LOGIC IN ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO VOTE I WANT PEOPLE TO VOTE I WANT YOUNGSTERS TO VOTE WE HAVE A HORRIBLE TURNOUT WHEN IT COMES TO YOUNG FOLKS TURNING OUT AND BEING PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. THAT'S A VISIBLE THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. BUT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE ANSWER IN FACT HE JUST CREATES ANOTHER STRANGE IRREGULARITY INCONSISTENCY ON WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN ADULT. IF IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES EIGHTEEN VOTE IF IT'S TWENTY ONE TO DRINK IT'S TWENTY ONE TO DRINK I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE- CREATING. THESE ODD ENCUMBRANCES IN EXCEPTIONS TO A PROCESS WHEN YOU'RE IN ADULT YOU ACHIEVE THE RESPONSIBILITIES AS WELL AS THE OPPORTUNITIES. YOU CAN'T GO FASTER. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM PRESIDENT YOU KNOW THOSE ON THE FRONT LINES OF MOST JUSTICE MOVEMENTS THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE BEEN YOUNG PEOPLE THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT- THE MUSCLE BEHIND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND LET'S NOT FORGET DOCTOR KING HAVE ACCOMPLISHED ALL THAT WE KNOW THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE HIS ASSASSINATION AT THIRTY NINE. YOU KNOW IN MY OPINION CIVIC ENGAGEMENT CAN'T START EARLY ENOUGH. BONY WE HOPE TO BECOME A PRACTICE VOTING IS ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU ENGAGE SEPARATELY. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF A YOUNG PERSON'S LIFE IS GOVERNED BY A DECISION MADE BY SOME ELECTED BODY. THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL THE TYPE OF CURRICULUM THEY STUDY IN CALIFORNIA FOR A WHILE YOU HAD TO PASS A HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM THE DECISION MADE BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. SO WHAT IS THE HARM IN GIVING THEM ENCOURAGING THEM INVITING THEM TO ENGAGE SPECIFICALLY AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. THEY WILL BE VOTING AT EIGHTEEN BY THE NOVEMBER GENERAL THIS IS SIMPLY ALLOWING THEM TO ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS INFILL PART OF THE PROCESS BY CASTING THEIR VOTES LEADING UP TO THE PRIMARY. WHAT IS THE HARM IN THAT LET'S BE CLEAR VOTING TURNOUT IS A BIT SMALL ACROSS AGE GROUPS. THE LET'S NOT CRIMINALIZE YOUNG PEOPLE. HALF OF THE FOLKS IN THE STATE AND OUR OWN AGES DON'T BLOW. FULL JUST MAYBE IF WE CAPTURE THE ATTENTION IN THE IN THE IN IN THE INTEREST. OF YOUNG PEOPLE FRESH OUT OF U. S. HISTORY- CALIFORNIA HISTORY CIVICS CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL MAYBE WE CAN HELP TURN THE TIDE IN TERMS OF INCREASING VOTER TURNOUT ACROSS THE STATE. I TRAVEL WITH THE SENATE MANY OF TO FALLS AGO. IT IS A TEN YEAR DEMOCRACY AT THE NEW DEMOCRACY. WE WERE BLOWN AWAY AND QUITE FRANKLY EMBARRASSED WHEN WE LEARNED OF THEIR VOTER TURN OUT. THINK THE VOTER TURNOUT WAS NINETY SOME PERCENT. THEY LOOKED AT US WE MET WITH MANY THEIR ELECTED LEADERS AND THEY LOOK AT US AND ASK US WHAT ARE VOTER TURNOUT WAS AND WE ALL GOT COMPLETELY CONFUSE OWNED STARTED MUMBLING. AND I WAS JUST INTRIGUED BY THAT I WODERED WHY AND I THOUGHT MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE NEW DEMOCRACY. ON PEOPLE ARE GAYS ARE INTERESTED WANT TO BE A PART OF IT. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. BUT I REALLY. COME ON I THINK THE FURTHER WE GET FROM SEVENTEEN THE FOGGY ARE REAR VIEW MIRROR GETS IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE ONLY HAS WERE LIKE GET SEVENTEEN. WHY NOT. ENGAGE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. IN STARTING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. AND GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN IN TERMS OF HOLES ON THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD. WHO RUNS THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WHO WINS THEIR CITY COUNCILS WHO WHO RUNS THEIR- WATER BOARDS IN THEIR DISH ONE. ON THE IN SUPPORT OF CA. THANK YOU SIR MITCHELL SENATOR HELLO. YEAH. SENATOR ALLEN YOU WISH TO SPEAK. TO MY COLLEGE FROM WESTERN TO CONTEST JOB OF THINGS OF REALLY COME IT I MEAN IN THE END OF THE DAY GUYS YOU KNOW WE'RE CALL THIS I DON'T THE THIS IS HAVE THIS IS. WHAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE JUST LETTING FOLKS PARTISAN IN THE PRICE A- FOR THAT'S PART OF THE SO CHOOSING THE CANDIDATES THAT WILL BE ON THE NEW BALLOT SOMETIME OF COURSE THE PRIMARY LET. AND BEING THE FINE ACTION AS SAW YOU KNOW WITH BUT THERE ARE GOOD FRIEND DAILY ON WHO IS JUST ALLOW TO THIS COUNCIL BECAUSE HE REACHED THAT PER THREAT IN THE IN IN IT IS CAL RACE AND SO HE'S RAISED MAKE IT TO THE NOVEMBER EVEN THOUGH OTHER RACES MAKE IT TO NOVEMBER BOUT NAY AND IT IS VERY WOULD HAVE BEEN ME TO THE NOVEMBER ABOUT. NINE FIFTY FOR SO THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE THE OPTION. TO YOU KNOW WHO WHO SHOULD KEPT IN ON WHO KNEW. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CYCLE THAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND AS- GIVEN THE FACT THAT ABOUT TO TURN EIGHTEEN. AND I'VE A- THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN SENATOR STERN. A VERY BRIEFLY IN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- LONG TIME COMING HERE. AB THIS THIS EXPANSION OF ENFRANCHISEMENT AND SUFFRAGE TO BASICALLY A VOICELESS GENERATION IS SORELY NEEDED AT THIS MOMENT WE ALLOW SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS TO DRIVE. TWO THOUSAND POUNDS METAL OBJECTS CALLED CARS AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN ON OUR ROADS- THEY GO TO SCHOOLS. THEY PLAY IN THE PARKS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE FUNDING OR THE LACK THERE OF- THEY LIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THERE'S TRYING TO SPEAK UP BUT NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO GIVE THEM A VENUE FOR THAT VOICE AT THE BALLOT AND IT COULDN'T COME QUICKLY ENOUGH- I TAUGHT CIVICS AFTER I WENT TO COLLEGE. AND I HATED TO SPEAK INTO THOSE HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS. BASS HE- AND THEN THE DAHLE PEDICLE. THE IDEA YOU GET TO LEARN ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION AND YOU LEARN ABOUT HOW BILL BECOMES A LAW AND YOU WATCH THIS SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK VIDEO BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ON OLD ENOUGH YOU'RE NOT MATURE ENOUGH. WEIGHT TO YOU MOVE AWAY FROM HOME. DISCONNECT YOURSELF FROM YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR COMMUNITY. MAYBE YOU GO OFF TO COLLEGE SOMEWHERE AND THEN FIGURE OUT. HOW TO ENGAGE IN CIVICS. BUT FOR ALL THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE LEAVING HOME. WELL LISTEN- WE TEACH HIM THAT FIRST VOTERS IN CONNECTED TO WHERE THEY'RE FROM- WE BUILD CIVIC HABIT. STARTING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- THANK THE AUTHOR AND ELECTIONS CHAIR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN STRONG SUPPORT ACA FOR. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- SAY- I WAS TO GO INTO THINGS THAT MOST TO ENJOY IS ACTUALLY- MEETING WITH HIGH SCHOOL- CLASSES TO TALK ABOUT- OUR GOVERNMENTS AND THINK IT IS- FRIEND JUST REFERENCED AND- THE IDEA THAT WOULD BE TALKING TO THEM ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE ENGAGE DIRECTLY INTO VOTE AND YET TELL THEM THAT WELL LATER IS WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT IS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY AND CERTAINLY AT A DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN I THINK WE CAN HAVE THE BATES ABOUT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S MENTAL SO FORTH BUT I THINK IT'S PRETTY REASONABLE TO SAY THAT A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD ON AVERAGE- BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT ON AVERAGE IS CERTAINLY REPORTING CABLE ONE I'D POINT ACTUALLY BY EXPERIENCES THAT AT THAT AGE THEY'RE MORE CURIOUS AND MORE INTERESTED IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND GETTING ANSWERS ABOUT THE ISSUES THEN FRANKLY A LOT OF OTHER VOTERS ARE SO I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT GETTING THIS OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY GETS MORE ENGAGED USE BUT ALSO WILL BRING IN VOTERS THAT ACTUALLY. ARE MORE INTERESTED IN TRYING TO EXPOSE THESE ISSUES BECAUSE ALL BRAND NEW TO THEM AND- SO I TONIGHT BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN SENATOR WILK FOLLOWED BY SENATOR ARCHER LET. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I STAND IN SUPPORT OF A CA FOR. I KNOW FOR ME MY FIRST ELECTION WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. AND THE FIRST PERSON EVER CAST A VOTE FOR WITH KEN MADDY AND COURSE WE HAVE OUR OUR OF ROOM HERE- NAMED AFTER HIM. AND I WAS INVOLVED IN THAT CAMPAIGN VOTED FOR HIM IF IT HAD BEEN AN EARLY PRIMARY LIKE TO WAS THIS YEAR I WOULD HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR HIM EVEN THOUGH I WAS VOLUNTEERING FOR HIM. AND AS MENTIONED BY MY FRIEND FROM SACRAMENTO HI TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHETHER IT'S IN THE CLASSROOM YMCA BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB AND- THEY ARE INTERESTED IN IN SAID EX BUT THEY'RE ALSO STUCK BY THE INFORMATION I GIVE THEM. BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE THEM THE AND FILTERED TRUTH AND WE ALL TALK ABOUT THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND THAT IS IN FACT TRUE. BUT I JUST GOT A LATEST FIGURES FROM OUR GOOD FRIEND FROM. COUNTY ARE UNRESTRICTED NET POSITION FOR THIS STATE IS NEGATIVE TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. WE ARE SELLING THE NEXT GENERATION WITH CRUSHING pBE INVOLVED NOW AND HAVE A SAY NOW- BEFORE WE DO ANY MORE DAMAGE I THINK THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLY SMART THIRTY MAKING WIDE- WISE CHOICES. AND I THINK THE SOONER THE WE GET THEM ENGAGED AT THE BETTER AND I THINK I A CA FOR IS A RESPONSIBLE. OF RESPONSE TO LACK OF BEEN A CIVIC ENGAGEMENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THANK YOU. SENATE SENATOR WILK SENATOR ARCHER LET. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT. YOU KNOW WE WERE HEARD SOMEONE MENTION THE MILITARY. AND I SERVED WITH YOUNG MEN WHO WERE SEVENTEEN TURNED EIGHTEEN BEFORE WE WENT INTO COMBAT I WAS EIGHTEEN WHEN I JOINED- MY SON ONE OF MY SONS WENT OFF TO WEST POINT HE WAS SEVENTEEN. ALL DURING HIS SENIOR YEAR AND I SEND THEM OFF TO- WEST POINT PREP SCHOOL WHEN HE WAS SEVENTEEN AND CHANGE I FORGET EXACTLY WAS BUT HE TURNED EIGHTEEN WHILE HE WAS AT WEST POINT. OF THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF. ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE. PROTESTING UP AND DOWN THE STREETS WHO ARE. ABOUT THAT AGE THAT ARE SEVENTEEN WILL BE EIGHTEEN WHEN IT'S READY TO VOTE ARE YOU AFRAID THE FACT IS THAT THEY WILL CHANGE THE SOCIETY IN SUCH A WAY. THAT NOW WE SEE A QUALITY OF FURNACE TODAY WE TALKED ABOUT BILL THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR BETTER WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE AND WORK- WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY NOW TO OPEN THE DOORS FOR THIS NEXT GENERATION. AND AGAIN REMEMBER. IT IS SEVENTEEN THAT'S A PRIMARY IT'LL TAKE A MINUTE EIGHTEEN SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD STOP THEM. FROM THEIR PROGRESS IN EDUCATION AND PARTICIPATING BECAUSE I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN MORE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN. INVOLVED IN SOCIETY IN WHAT'S GOING ON THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. SO I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A HARD LOOK I THINK WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE NEW WAVE AND WE SHOULD SUPPORT IT. AND I SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHER LETTER SENATOR RUBIO. MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE QUICK POINT WE ALL HAVE ALREADY BELABOR THE POINT SPREAD YOU KNOW PERSONALLY FOR ME I REMEMBER THE FRUSTRATION I FELT HEARING CALIFORNIA WHEN WE WOULD SEE ALL THE PRIMARY SAPPING ALL OVER IT. THE UNITED STATES AND BY THE TIME WE HAD TO GO INTO OUR TO VOTE PRETTY MUCH WE WERE LEFT WITH. WHAT SOMEONE ELSE HAD DECIDED FOR US AND SO I THINK THIS IS JUST A WAY FOR ALLOWING THEM TO ALSO BE PART OF. YOU KNOW WHO WE SELECTED MOVE FORWARD TO THE NOVEMBER ELECTION SO I THINK IT'S JUST A GOOD WAY TO. TAKE IT OUR YOUNG FOLKS ASSN VAGUELY ENGAGE BUT AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. HOW THE DECISION MAKING. GOING TO THE PRIMARY SO THEY CAN TAKE THE PERSON THAT THEY WANT ASKED HI LIKE I SAID WAS VERY FRUSTRATED THAT WE ALWAYS. EAT I DON'T MEAN TO DISRESPECT BUT THE LEFTOVER OF WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE SO WITH THAT I ALSO ASK FOR NAVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO IS THERE ANY FURTHER DEBATE AND DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR UMBERG YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LET ME RESPOND A FEW COMMENTS HERE- FIRST. LET ME RESPOND TO A COMMENT.

NOW THE COMMENT WITH RESPECT TO MY FRIEND FROM FRESNO THAT WE ONLY ALLOW EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS TO A MILITARY ACTUALLY SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS DO AND DO JOINT MILITARY AS MY FRIEND FROM PEOPLE REVERE AND MY FRIEND FROM RIVERSIDE POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS IN THE MILITARY AND IF WE TRUST THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD TO JUMP OUT OF A C.

MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH COVERAGE SENATOR WINNER FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESIDENT OF COLLEAGUES SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE- IS A BILL THAT WILL HELP US ON OUR LONG JOURNEY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH OR ADDICTIONS CHALLENGES CAN ACTUALLY GET THE CARE THEY NEED. SPECIFICALLY IT WILL REQUIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COVER ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CARE THAT SEEMS PRETTY COMMON SENSE IF THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT PARTICULAR CARE IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY YOU WOULD THINK THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD COVER IT UNFORTUNATELY THEY OFTEN DON'T AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY SITUATIONS WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL ONLY COVER MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CARE. IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN CRISIS IF YOU'RE ALREADY HEADING TO THE SITE EMERGENCY ROOM IF YOU'RE ALL ON RAVELING IS REALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN IF YOU WERE DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE LUNG CANCER AND YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY TURNED AROUND AND SAID. IT'S TOO EARLY WE WILL COVER YOU ONCE YOU'RE STAGE FOUR CANCER WE WOULD LAUGH THEM OUT OF THE BUILDING. IF THEY TALK ABOUT POSITION BUT THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION THERE. ANSWER THE CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT. WHICH SAYS THAT YOU HAVE TO TREAT MENTAL HEALTH. THE SAME AS PHYSICAL HEALTH BECAUSE WE KNOW TO FRANKLY ARE NO DIFFERENT AND IT'S TIME TO MOVE BEYOND. THE THIRD PART OF ME. THE ACT IS INCOMPLETE IT IS LIMITED TO A SUBSET OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. IT DOESN'T COVER THINGS LIKE PTSD. IT DOESN'T COVER SUBSTANCE USE. DISORDER IT DOESN'T COVER ANXIETY CONDITIONS IT DOESN'T COVER A WHOLE VARIETY OF CONDITIONS A REALLY HARM PEOPLE'S LIVES. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CRISIS IN THE STATE. NGUYEN CMO IS VISIBLY ON OUR STREETS BUT IT IS NOT JUST ON OUR STREETS AND COVER NINETEEN IS MAKING IT WORSE. PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO CARE. EIGHT FIFTY FIVE WILL DO THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER DEBATER DISCUSSIONS SENATOR BAIL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TO MEMBERS- RISES SO PROUD PRINCIPLE COSTS ARE IN SUPPORT OF- SP- EIGHT FIVE FIVE MENTAL HEALTH HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SEGREGATED ELEMENT OF HEALTH CARE. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO IN OUR MINDS TO THINK OF MENTAL HEALTH AS A SOCIAL FAILING NOT A LEGITIMATE HEALTH CAREISSUE. THE STIGMA IS DANGEROUS TO HAVE DURING A TIME WHEN PEOPLE NEED MENTAL HEALTH CARE MORE THAN EVER. STRESS FOR ON. IS A- BY DURING THE PANDEMIC PEOPLE ARE LOSING JOBS AND BE ABLE TO PAY RENT. LOSING THEIR HOMES EXPERIENCING A SENIOR ISOLATION. STRESS CAN BE DETRIMENTAL FOR MANY PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE FIGHTING A DRUG ADDICTION NOW THE ADDICTION POLICY FORM FOUND IN A RECENT STUDY. 20% OF RESPONDENTS REPORTED INCREASED SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO THE CORNER VIRUS PANDEMIC. MENTAL HEALTH PARITY IS AN EMPTY PROMISE IF PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. GET EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AND UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO DELAY OR DENY LIFESAVING MEDICATION SINCE THE TREATMENT PRESCRIBED BY THE DOCTOR. MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER DISEASE WE DON'T TREAT IT IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE. IN ADDITION TO THIS BILL THE MENTAL HEALTH CAUCUSES SUPPORTED SB ZERO THREE WHICH ESTABLISHES THE PEER SUPPORT CERTIFICATION WE NEED TO PASS A MENTAL HEALTH. ROBUST MENTAL HEALTH BILL PACKAGE UNLESS WE REQUIRE PARITY PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO FACE A ROAD BOX TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE. FOR THIS REASON I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AN URGENT AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BILL SENATOR MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT WHAT THE AUTHOR IN CENTER FROM SANTA CLARA STATED I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THEY SAID. I'M JUST ENJOYING BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RECESSION. RAINY FIGURE OUT HOW WE PAY FOR ALL THE GREAT. ITEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY. AND SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE RESOLVE THE OBJECTIONS TO THIS BILL BY THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY SO IN HIS CLOTHES REMARKS I'D- LIKE TO CHALLENGE THE AUTHOR TO. MAYBE HELP ME WITH A FEW THINGS SO THAT I COULD. BE SUPPORTIVE FOR THIS BILL- ARE. EXPANDING THE LIST. TO ANY AND ALL MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DIAGNOSES. COULD BE A REAL SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM. IT WILL IMPACT THE PREMIUMS PAID FOR HEALTH CARE WHICH WILL IMPACT EVERYONE. IN THIS STATE. BUT IT MUST BE DONE. I'M NOT ARGUING AGAINST WHAT WE NEED TO DO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW AND WHEN WE DO IT. OUT OF NETWORK COVERAGE IS ALSO A PREMIUM RAZOR. WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS THIS NASTY STICKER SHOCK PROBLEM IN THE PAST AND LIKE TO KNOW HOW WE RESOLVE THAT. I WILL ALSO MAYBE GIVE A COUPLE OF IDEAS. ONE HAVE THE STATE'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN THE TOP SB A FIFTY FIVE AS A PILOT. WHY DON'T WE START WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS WORK FORCE. BUT SEE WHAT IT DOES TO THE COST OF THE PREMIUMS AND SEE HOW IT WORKS LET'S. TESTED WE COULD DO IT OURSELVES AND BE THE FIRST. CLIENT AND THEN WE CAN. MIGRATED OVER TO THE REST OF THE STATE OR TWO. AB WE PHASE IN. THE NINE SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESSES MAYBE ONE PER YEAR. TO EASE THE PAIN OR THE PROGRESSION OF WHAT COULD APPEAR IN INSURANCE PREMIUMS JUST TRYING TO SEE HOW WE- FIT IN. IF WE DO IT OVER THE NINE YEARS IT'LL IT'LL PROVIDE- PROVIDERS THE ABILITY TO HAVE EXPERIENCE STUDIES TO SEE HOW. THE PRICING THEIR PREMIUMS AND HOW. THEIR CALIBRATING FAIR AND APPROPRIATE. PREMIUMS SO WE NEED TO STRIKE A BALANCE I THINK BETWEEN AFFORDABILITY. WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO THE TAXPAYERS ESPECIALLY NOW AND TO THE PROVIDERS I COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HIS EFFORTS IN GOALS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ACHIEVING A SOLUTION. A MAJOR BUT LONG OVERDUE THIRTY INITIATIVE MUST BE PURSUED I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIMING THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. FOR MORE LARK IS ARE ANY FURTHER DEBATE FOR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SEEING AND HEARING NONE. SENATOR WINNER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT- THANK YOU COLLEAGUES- TO THE- CENTER FOR ORANGE COUNTY THANK YOU FOR THOSE REMARKS I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THAT SUBURBAN NOW. THAT ANALYZES FOR ANY COVERAGE MANDATE WHAT THE IMPACT ON PREMIUMS GOING TO BE PROJECTED A DE MINIMUS IMPACT ON PREMIUMS BECAUSE OF THIS BILL TRULY THE MINIMUS AND SO THAT REPORT IS THERE ARE YOU KNOW TO BELIEVE ME ARE NEUTRAL- EVALUATORS MADE THAT DETERMINATION. AND IN TERMS OF TRYING MEDI CAL FIRST. THE REALITIES MEDI CAL IS ALREADY DOING THIS MEDI CAL DIDN'T NEED A LEGAL MANDATE TO DO IT AND MEDICAL COVERAGE IS MUCH BROADER THAN THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY IF THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY WERE ALREADY DOING THIS WE WOULDN'T NEED A BILL. UNFORTUNATELY WE SEEN YEAR AFTER YEAR DECADE AFTER DECADE. THAT THE PRIVATE HEALTH DRAMATICALLY LIMITED ITS COVERAGE. AND WE WOULD NEVER TOLERATE THAT FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH HOWEVER AND YET WE'VE BEEN TOLERATING IT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED. PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PEOPLE- WHEN THEY'RE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY DOESN'T COVER THEM. GOING TO CRISIS THEY LOSE THEIR JOB THEY LOSE THEIR HOUSING THEY LOSE THEIR FAMILY. AND THEN WHO PAYS FOR THEM GUESS WHAT NOT THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY. BECAUSE THEY LOST THEIR JOB THEY'VE LOST THEIR INSURANCE. US IT'S THE TAXPAYERS AND S BY THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY REFUSING TO COVER FAILING TO COVER SO MANY MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CHALLENGES. IT BECOMES A SUBSIDY BY THE TAXPAYERS BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE AND ARE IN CRISIS ON THE STREETS INDIGENT AND THE TAXPAYERS CARE FOR THEM. SO I THINK THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY SHOULD DO ITS JOB. AND SHOULD COVER ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CARE. THIS IS ONLY ONE A DOCTOR SAYS UNDER APPLICABLE MEDICAL STANDARDS THAT THIS TREATMENT IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THIS PERSON TO TREAT THIS CONDITION. I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE THING TO ASK AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN I ARCHULETA I ATKINS I BATES NO WELL I FORGES.

HI THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT BY COLLEAGUES I SENATE BILL EIGHT NINETY NINE- IS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILLS IT IS PART OF THE SENATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION PACKAGE- AND IT WILL ENABLE US TO PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL ALLOWS RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING CHURCHES BALM AS WELL AS NONPROFIT COLLEGES TO BUILD 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THEIR LANDS. RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MANY CHURCHES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS NONPROFIT COLLEGES THAT HAVE TEXAS LANDS- THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON WHETHER IT'S FOR LOW INCOME SENIORS ARE FOR EMANCIPATED FOSTER YOUTH. OR FOR FORMALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE WERE LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES- THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO IT BUT THEY ARE UNABLE TO LOCAL RESTRICTIONS. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THEM TO BUILD THAT HOUSING- WE HAVE WORKS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE BILL DOES SO IN A WAY THAT IS SENSITIVE TO THE LOCAL CONTACTS. IN TERMS OF HIGH INTENSITY AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THOSE ISSUES ARE BECAUSE THIS IS A GOOD AND WORTH BILL WE ARE SHORT MILLIONS OF HOME. AND YEAH. AND ABOUT HALF OF THAT SURE. IS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND SO WE SHOULD ALLOW THESE NON. TO FILL THURMOND AND TO HELP PEOPLE GET HOUSING- I WON I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THE TWO LARGEST AFFORDABLE HOUSING COALITIONS IN THE STATE THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NONPROFIT HOUSING I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I'D LIKE TO THANK THE GOOD CENTER FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR ITS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP- ON IN OUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I SUPPORT THE EFFORTS TO HELP- DEVELOPERS BUILD PROJECTS QUICKER HOWEVER I BELIEVE WE NEED TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT NOT ONLY HELPS DEVELOPERS BUILD PROJECTS FASTER BUT ALSO. PROVIDES WORK OPPORTUNITIES IN MIDDLE CLASS WAGES TO THOSE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS HARD TO BUILD IT NOW MORE THAN EVER. DURING THIS TIME A PANDEMIC BECAUSE- BECAUSE RECESSION WHEN FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING. WE MUST BE PRUDENT AND ENSURE WE TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS AND PREVAILING WAGE AND THE REQUIREMENT OF SKILLED AND TRAINED WORK FORCE PROVIDES A PATH TO THE MIDDLE CLASS A PAST THAT IS NOT NOW NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.

BRYCE TO SUPPORT- THIS BILL AND- THANK A CENTER WIENER THE AUTHOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING- OF WE KNOW THAT- PRODUCTION OF HOUSING IN GENERAL IS GOOD THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH MARKER RATE AND ALL THE OTHER KIND OF HOUSING THAT WE NEED.

PLEASE IN GENERAL THE SENATE WE'RE NOW MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM FORTY SEVEN THAT'S SB NINE SEVENTY THREE SENATE JACKSON IS PREPARED TO PRESENT MADAM SECRETARY CAN YOU PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL NINE SEVENTY THREE BY SENATOR JACKSON AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT. LEADING CENTER JACKSON THE FLOOR IS YOURS. WE'RE WORKING ON THE MICROPHONE IS GIVE US A MOMENT. JACKSON HAS TRIED OUT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES. YOU KNOW YESTERDAY ON THIS FLOOR WE HAD A VERY I THINK HEART FILLED DISCUSSION. ARE DEALING WITH RACE AND QUESTIONS ABOUT BIAS. AND THE- GENDER BIAS RACISM THAT THAT THE NOTION THAT. MOST OF US BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL. AND YET WE KNOW IN THIS WORLD TODAY THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE RACE AND GENDER HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON PEOPLE BECAUSE WE ARE KNOWINGLY. ARE FINE SO SOMETIMES WITH A BIAS. AND SO THIS IS A BILL. THAT IS DESIGNED TO FIGHT PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA WITH INFORMATION. ABOUT PAY DIFFERENTIALS YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT WOMEN ARE PAID EIGHTY FOUR CENTS TO EVERY DOLLAR A MAN MAKES AND THAT WOMEN OF COLOR FARE EVEN WORSE BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT WE PAY PEOPLE FLASH WE DON'T THINK THAT THERE ARE LEVELS OF DISCRIMINATION IN HIGHER. UP RESPONSIBILITY MANAGEMENT TYPE POSITIONS AND YET. THERE ARE THESE DIFFERENCES AND SO THIS IS A BILL. THAT WILL PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LARGE COMPANIES TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR. AND TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE IN FACT. DEMONSTRATING LEVELS OF BIAS BECAUSE IN THOSE BANDS IF YOU WILL. YOU'LL FIND WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. FOR MORE IN THE LOWER INCOME BRACKETS THEN IN THE HIGHER UPPER MANAGEMENT BRACKETS SO THIS IS A BILL THAT TRIES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PAY INEQUITY. BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T SEE SOMETHING. YOU CAN'T FIX IT AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DESIRES TO DO AND IS DESIGNED TO DO IT WILL REQUIRE LARGE EMPLOYERS TO SUBMIT A PAY DATA REPORT EVERY YEAR TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION AND HOURS WORKED OF EMPLOYEES BY GENDER. BY RACE BY ETHNICITY AND BY JOB CATEGORY NOW IN RESPONSE TO BUSINESS COMMUNITY CONCERNS THIS DATA WILL NOT BE MADE PUBLIC MY GOAL HERE IS NOT TO SHAME ANYONE TO OUT ANYONE IT'S JUSTSIMPLY TO GET COMPANIES TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR. AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE INDEED DISCRIMINATING ON THOSE VARIOUS SPECIES. SO IT ENCOURAGES EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY HIRING AND PROMOTION PRACTICES AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE OF THE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PAY GAP IS WHAT IS CALLED JOB SEGREGATION THE CONCENTRATION OF WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AS I MENTIONED IN LOWER WAGE POSITIONS IN THE COMPANY. THE BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING TO GATHER IMPORTANT DATA. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SHE PATTERNS OF WAGE DISPARITIES AND IF THEY NOTICED THERE ARE DEVIATIONS OR OUT LIARS. TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER. THIS BILL IS CLOSELY MODELED AFTER EFFORTS THAT WERE STARTED DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. BUT HAVE BEEN HALTED UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAKING IT I BELIEVE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THE CALIFORNIA PER SHOULD WHICH OWN PATH AND IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING IF THERE'S A DATA MAKES A DIFFERENCE LAST YEAR. INTEL THE INTEL VOLUNTARILY RELEASED THIS DATA AND REVEALED THAT FORTY ONE OF FIFTY TWO TOP EXECUTIVES MAKING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR MEN. AND THIRTY SEVEN OF THOSE FIFTY TWO WERE WHITE. THIS REVELATION WAS ACTUALLY I OPENING TO THEM AND LED TO CALLS FOR CHANGE WITHIN THE COMPANY SO MEMBERS THE PAY GAP REMAINS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THE COSTS AN ESTIMATED SEVENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN LOST WAGES FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE ADVERSELY. AFFECTED BY THE COLD NINETEEN CRISIS YET THE VENT EVEN WITHOUT THIS PANDEMIC RECENT STUDIES PREDICT WE WILL NOT FULLY CLOSED THE PAY GAP. IF WE DON'T TAKE AGGRESSIVE STEPS FOR A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG SO WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATE JACKSON MEMBERS OF THE SENATE WE'RE GONNA BE OPENING UP FOR DISCUSSION OR DEBATE WE'RE GONNA START WITH SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL CITY SOLICITOR PAY GAP HAS BARELY BUDGED IT WILL NOT CLOSE FOR AS WE HEARD MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS. AT OUR CURRENT RATE THAT IS FAR TOO LONG FOR OUR DAUGHTERS AND OUR GRANDDAUGHTERS TO WAIT. THIS BILL WILL FORCE LARGER COMPANIES TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND EXAMINE HOW THEY'RE PAYING HIRING AND PROMOTING THEIR EMPLOYEES. SOME MAY BE AND WHERE. AND WHERE WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR FALL IN THE. FOR ALL THE WHITE MEN CLUSTERED IN THE TOP PAYING JOBS ARE WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN MORE OF THE JOBS THAT PAY LESS. THIS WILL BE A BIRDS EYE VIEW PICTURE THAT EMPLOERS WILL BE ABLE TO SEE FROM THESE REPORTS. THIS BILL GIVES EMPLOYERS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR FIXING EQUAL PAY AND HIRING AND PROMOTION PRACTICES I BELIEVE THAT MANY EMPLOYERS WHEN FACED WITH A TRUE PICTURE OF THEIR COMPANIES. WILL CHOOSE TO DO THE RIGHT THING I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR. MEMBERS FOR GOING TO GO TO LEADER GROW. THEN CENTERS SKINNER BEEN SKINNER MORLOCK. MADAME LEAVE. THANK YOU AND MISTER PRESIDENT I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. SENATE JACKSON WOULD YOU ACCEPT QUESTIONS LATER WROTE CERTAIN SHE WILL LEADER REAL PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FIRMS SANTA BARBARA. AS AN EMPLOYER WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES- I KNOW IT'S AGAINST THE LAW FOR ME TO ASK. ME GO RIGHT THROUGH YOUR BILL HERE IT'S IT GETS A LOT FOR ME TO ASK SOMEONE'S RACE ETHNICITY OR SEX. SO I GUESS JUST ASKING FOR WISDOM AND GUIDANCE UNDER THE AUTHORS DIRECTION OF THIS BILL HOW WOULD I AM EIGHTEEN THIS INFORMATION TO PROVIDE. THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IF IT'S ILLEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ME TO ASK FOR THIS INFORMATION. CONSIDER JACKSON THANK YOU THIS IS DONE IN IT AT ON DISH AGGREGATED FORM SO HAT THE NAME AND IDENTITY OF INDIVIDUALS. IS NOT INCLUDED THIS IS CHARLES TO FIND NUMBERS HOW MANY PEOPLE OF COLOR- HOW MANY WOMEN- YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO. ASK THEM I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO LEGAL WHEN SOMEONE IS HIRED- TO KNOW TO WHETHER THEY ARE MALE OR FEMALE BUT THIS IS NOT DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY ANY ONES PERSON SPECIFICALLY. IT IS INTENDED TO NOTIFY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WORK AND IT ONLY APPLIES TO COMPANIES OF A HUNDRED OR MORE SO LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. YOU HAVE TEN PEOPLE IN TOP MANAGEMENT THE QUESTION IS HOW MANY YEAR MAN HOW MANY ARE WOMEN. HOW MANY ARE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. HOW MANY ARE PEOPLE OF A DIFFERENT ETHNICITY SO IT DOESN'T ASK WHO THEY ARE AS INDIVIDUALS IT JUST SETS TO TRY TO GET THE IDEA A GENERAL NOTION. OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE IN YOUR UPPER LEVELS MID LEVELS LOWER LEVELS. I THE DISCRIMINANT. FACTUALLY DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICE NOT NECESSARILY INTO. BUT THAT IN FACT THERE ALL BY THE SECOND QUE. ARE WITHIN YOUR EMPLOYMENT THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON LEADER GROWING YOUR OWN TIME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND NO ADDITIONAL QUESTION I THINK MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM SENATE SANTA BARBARA FOR ANSWERING THAT QUESTION I GUESS. GENDER FLUIDITY BEING THING THAT IS- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ASK A MEMBERS GENDER- YOU CAN. YES I GUESS. BUT IT WOULD BE PROVIDING I'M SURE THERE'S SOME TYPE OF DISCLOSURE ON THIS DOCUMENT IT'S GOING TO BE REQUESTED THAT CERTIFIES YOU UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY LIKE MOST REQUIREMENTS THAT EMPLOYERS FACE AND I GUESS YOU COULD GUESS WHAT NATIONALITY OR RACE SOMEONE IS. BUT WITHOUT BEING SPECIFIC IN ASKING OR HAVING SOME TYPE OF LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW THE EMPLOYEE TO SELF IDENTIFY WHICH WOULD MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER- I STILL DON'T KNOW. AND I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE GOING I DO I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION EARLIER AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT MY OWN STAFF. THE TOP FIVE EXECUTIVES IN MY COMPANY YEAR OLD WOMEN EVERYONE OF THEM- FOR OUR LATINO AND THEN YOU GOT ME. SO AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE LEVEL MANAGEMENT AGAIN- YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY DIVERSE AND- SO LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN THAT THAT JUROR THAT CONVERSATION THAT YOU AND I WERE HAVING EARLIER. SO I AGREE WE'RE GOING WITH IT. FROM BOARD ROOMS IN THERE ARE WOMEN ABSENT AND THERE ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR ABSENT IN HIGH LEVELS IT SOME COMPANIES. AND I THINK THE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH IT SOUNDS GOOD ABOUT GETTING THE INFORMATION BUT IT DOESN'T WORK ON THE GROUND IT DOESN'T WORK IN THE PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ASK THAT INFORMATION WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ASK IT IN THE IDENTIFIES AS MALE OR FEMALE WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ASK IF THERE. ARE FEMALE WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ASK THEIR RACE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO EVEN BRING THAT INTO A COP TOPIC OF CONVERSATION IN AN INTERVIEW. SO I GUESS IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA REQUIRE THE EMPLOYER TO. I DON'T KNOW CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE pAND CORRECT. THEN THAT WOULD BE ONE THING THAT I'M SURE LIKE I LIKE I SAID EVERY OTHER THING THAT WE HAVE TO SUBMIT TO AGENCIES- IS REQUIRED THAT WE HAVE TO SIGN AND IF THERE'S NO WAY FOR US TO GATHER THIS INFORMATION WITHOUT BREAKING THE CURRENT LAW. IN FACING FINES AND PENALTIES AND PAGO LAWSUITS. IT DOESN'T THIS BILL JUST DOES NOT WORK ON THE GROUND UNLESS YOU HAVE A PROVISION IN THAT BILL THAT ALLOWS US TO GARNER THIS INFORMATION. TO PROVIDE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING- UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT. THIS IS THE CORRECT IMPROPER INFORMATION BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS I DON'T SEE HOW THIS CAN BE PUT TO WORK ON THE GROUND SO I WOULD REQUEST A NO VOTE RESPECTFULLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MEMBERS FOR GONNA BE MOVING ON TO CENTER SKINNER THEN WE'RE GONNA TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO CENTER MORE LOCKED GOOD EVENING CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU AT. MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS- I READ WITH INTEREST I. WAS ABOUT SIX MONTHS AG I THINK- AN ARTICLE THAT CITED- BENNY OFF MARC BENIOFF WHO IS THE CEO OF SALES FORCE. NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU FOLLOWED. MARC BENIOFF IS. VIEWS HIMSELF AS QUITE A- VERY SORT OF. SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE CEO. VERY LARGE FROM A COMPANY. AND HE ASKED HIS OWN HR DEPARTMENT. TO PROVIDE FOR HIM SOME DATA. ONE THE EMPTY HOW MANY WOMEN WERE EMPLOYED OF WHERE THEY WERE IN MANAGEMENT PAY RATES. AND HE AND HE WAS QUOTED THAT HE ASSUMED. THAT HIS COMPANY BECAUSE OF HIS ATTITUDES AND SUCH AND HE HE HAD A- THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE. PROMINENT WOMAN IN HIS EXECUTIVE SUITE. THAT HE JUST ASSUMED THAT HE WOULD HAVE GOOD NUMBERS OF WOMEN IN TOP MANAGEMENT AND THAT THEIR PAY SCALES WOULD BE COMPARABLE TO THE MEN. HE WAS. VERY SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT EVEN IN HIS COMPANY. THE WOMEN WERE PAID FAR LESS THAN THE MEN FOR ALMOST THE SAME POSITIONS FORCED THE SAME I SHOULDN'T EVEN SAY ALMOST. AIRLINES THAT THEY WERE NOT IN THE SAME LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT AND SO HE BASICALLY ORDERED HIS COMPANY. TO REDO THE SALARY SCHEDULES AND- FIX THAT. THAT ERROR THAT HE FOUND TWENTY GOT THE DATA. SO I THINK THAT OR DID SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA'S POINT OF A COMPANY BEING ABLE TO HAVE A MERE AND TO LOOK AT IT. THAT HOPEFULLY IT WILL CAUSE MANY COMPANIES TO DO JUST WHAT MISTER BENNY OPTED WITH SALES FORCE AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATE SKINNER. GETTING CENTER MORE LIKE THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOT A QUESTION ABOUT THE AUTHORED BY MAY. THANK YOU CENTER MORLOCKS INTERJECTED YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION SIR. THREE MORE LUCKY PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THINK IS- BETTER PRESIDENT I'M JUST. IS IT IN THE DATA THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR ONE OF THE THINGS I DID NOT SEE WHAT IS YEARS OF SERVICE. IS THAT NOT IMPORTANT. WELL AGAIN THE ISSUE HERE IS NOT TO JUDGE WHAT OF OR TO HAVE ANYONE JUDGE WHAT THE COMPANY IS DOING OTHER THAN THE COMPANY ITSELF. OUR AS WAS MENTIONED OF MISTER BENNY OFF DID THIS WITH HIS OWN COMPANY IT'S JUST THE IT'S BASICALLY A TOOL FOR A COMPANY TO SELF ASSESS AND TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE SITUATIONS SO. THIS ISN'T ANYTHING WE'RE WE'RE COMPARING BETWEEN COMPANIES OR WITHIN THE COMPANY ITSELF OTHER THAN TO IDENTIFY. WHO IS BEING PAID THE UPPER MANAGEMENT JOBS WHAT THEIR GENDER AND RACES AND BY THE WAY THEY SELF IDENTIFY THE LAW DOES PERMIT INDIVIDUALS TO SELF IDENTIFY SO WHEN YOU ARE ASKED- DURING YOUR- FOR EXAMPLE- WHAT JOB DO YOU HAVE WHAT IS YOUR GENDER WHAT IS YOUR RACE. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELF IDENTIFY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO MAY BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE NOW TODAY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT IDENTIFY AS MALE OR FEMALE SO THERE IS ALSO THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFIES NON BINARY. THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE THE ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT A COMPANY IN THE VARIOUS BANDS OF EMPLOYMENT THE G. VERY JOB CATEGORIES WHETHER WE ARE SEEKING PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN IN. A PARTICULARLY SEGREGATED INTO CERTAIN JOB CATEGORIES THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS LEGISLATION CENTER MORE LIKE TO HAVE A FOLLOW UP ON THAT WATER AB I JUST YEAH I DON'T HAVE THE QUESTION TO ME. HAVE MY OWN COMMENTS FOR INSTANCE IN YOUR OWN TIME I'M IN MY FOURTH CAREER MISTER PRESIDENT AND- THAT WAS A PARTNER IN A CPA FIRM TO OFFICES ARE NOT A HUNDRED PEOPLE BUT- PRETTY SIZEABLE WHEN YOU COMBINE BOTH OFFICES- AND THEN I WAS TREASURER I'D- IN. THE WORK FORCE WAS VERY COSMOPOLITAN IT I LOVE THAT SO MANY COUNTRIES REPRESENTED SEVEN CUP ALONG WE HAD A BALL HER CLASS SHOULD. BE A BETTER ADJECTIVE BUT SO I'M I'M. JUST REFLECT. AND I'M THINKING WELL IF I HAD A IN MY FOR IF I WOULD HAVE HIGHER. WOMAN WHO. HAS BEEN WERE THE FIRM FOR TEN YEARS AND WORKED HER WAY UP TO ONE OF MY MANAGEMENT SPOTS- AND HAS THAT TITLE- BUT THEN I HIRE A MAN WHO HAS ONLY BEEN THERE FOR A YEAR. DO I NEED TO PAY HIM THE SAME SALARY THAT. SHE IS MAKING WHEN SHE HAS WORKED HER WAY UP. YEAR AFTER YEAR WE'VE GIVEN TO PAY INCREASES. AND SO I WOULDN'T WANT TO SAY HEY THERE MIGHT THERE MIGHT BOTH HAVE THE SAME TITLE BUT THE MAN SHOULD BE PAID LESS BECAUSE HE HASN'T BEEN WITH THE FIRM. LONG ENOUGH FOR AS AS LONG. AS SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS THAT WITH THAT THE DATA. ISN'T SO SIMPLE THAT YOU COME UP WITH THE WRONG CONCLUSIONS AND SO THAT'S WHY I INQUIRED MISTER PRESIDENT WHY. MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE YEARS OF SERVICE SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A FAIR. COMPARISON BETWEEN. CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SONORA. BASINGER IN THE SENATE WE'RE GONNA RECOGNIZE SENATOR JONES COULD EVEN SENATORS. GOOD AFTERNOON MR PRESIDENT YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB. I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR IF THAT'S OKAY. SENATE JACKSON WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION FROM CENTER JONES CERTAIN CENTER JONES PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU I'M ENQUIRING IF THE BILL- AND THE AND THE REQUIREMENTS WOULD. BE APPLICABLES TO A GOVERNMENT AGENCIES- IN PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- CITIES AND- MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY STATE AGENCIES THANK YOU. YEAH AND IF NOT WHY NOT SENATE JACKSON IF YOU TO MY PROCEED ON THE ANSWER CERTAINLY THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER THE EO ONE DOCUMENT. THAT COMPANIES OF OVER A HUNDRED HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY THE FILE FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. IT JUST SIMPLY ADDS TO THAT DISCUSSION. WHETHER OR NOT OR WHAT THE RACE AND GENDER ARE OF THE PEOPLE WHOSE INFORMATION IS ALREADY BEING FOR REQUIRED UNDER THE EMAIL ONE DOCUMENT. THIS SIMPLY ADDS AN ADDITIONAL CATEGORY TO THAT PROCEDURE SO IF YOU ARE BEEN REQUIRED TO FILE IN THE YEAR ONE DOCUMENT YOU WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FILE IT AGAIN AND THIS TIME IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE THE INFORMATION WHICH I HAVE JUST IDENTIFIED IN BANDS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE MALE OR FEMALE I SHOULD SAY WHO ARE IN THE JANITORIAL PART OF YOUR BUSINESS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER. WELL I'VE GOT FOUR WHO HAD TEN YEARS EXPERIENCE OR TWO WHO HAD ONE YEAR EXPERIENCE WHICH TRUSTS LOOKING AT CATEGORIES WE BECAUSE THERE IS A CONCERN. THAT WE HAVE FOUND PEOPLE BASED UPON RACE AND GENDER ARE OFTEN PUT INTO VARIOUS SEGREGATED CATEGORIES THE GOAL IS TO HAVE COMPANIES THAT HAVE TO FILE THE EO ONE ANYWAY TO ALSO INCLUDE THIS CRITERIA SO THAT THEY CAN REALIZE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE. IMPLICITLY BIASED IF YOU WILL NOT THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUNISH THEM BUT SO THEY DO CAN LOOK IN THE MIRROR AS MISTER BENNY OPTED AND DISCOVER THESE FEMALE EMPLOYEES WERE BEING PAID SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FOR THE SAME IN THE SAME JOHN CATEGORY. AS THEIR MALE EMPLOYEES THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE VERY MANY PEOPLE OF COLOR. WHO WERE IN HIGHER MANAGEMENT POSITIONS IT'S A CHANCE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR. THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES AND IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE EO ONE FILER THEY'RE JUST ADDING THAT PART ON TO THE EAGLE ONE FORM THAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO VERY YEAR ANYWAY. THANK YOU SIR JACKSON- GOING TO TURN IT BACK OVER TO SENATOR JOHN CENTER JONES DO YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS SIR- YES JUST A JUST BRIEFLY- YEAH I'M NOT A LABOR ATTORNEY AND- IN MY BUSINESSES OF FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY I'VE NEVER. HAD TO THE EMPLOYEE OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE SO I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE E. ALL pIN HER CLOTHES COULD EDUCATE US ON WHETHER THE STATE AGENCIES HAVE TO FILE THE EO ONE OR NOT. AND LOCAL AGENCIES AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CENTER JONES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. IS GOING TO BE LAST CALL FOR DISK OR TO BE IN THE SENATE. HEARING SEEN NINE RETURNED BACK TO CENTER JACKSON FOR CLOTHES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INTERESTING DISCUSSION BUT NOT ON POINT TO WHAT THE BILL DOES. OUR THE BILL WHICH IS SIMPLY- SO THAT WE CAN ASCERTAIN WHY IT IS OR IF IT IS THAT WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. ARE PAID LESS IN VERY IS JOBS SEGREGATED CATEGORIES. IF YOU WRITE IN A PARTICULAR JOB I WOULD SUBMIT AS- AS A JANITOR YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE PAID AT THE SAME LEVEL YOU WILL BE PAID IF YOU ARE A MANAGER. AND THIS IS PART OF THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS WHY ARE ARE WE SEEING WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE LOWER PAYING JOB CATEGORIES IN COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY WILL BE PAID LESS OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW TOO MANY JANITORS TO MAKE TWO HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. WHICH IS WHAT A MANAGER IN SOME OF THESE COMPANIES MAKE. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE. AN ELEGANT SIMPLE SOLUTION THE INFORMATION IS KEPT CONFIDENTIAL IT'S A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW. SO A COMPANY CAN SEE WHAT THEY ARE THEY'RE NOT BEING COMPARED. TO ANOTHER COMPANY IT'S WHAT IS THIS COMPANY TO. AND AGAIN- IT IS FOR PEOPLE WHO FILED COMPANIES TO FIRE THE HE HE'LL ONE FORM AND THOSE ARE A PRIVATE EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES ARE ALREADY. REPORTING THIS DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION THE CHEST PULLS IT TOGETHER SO THAT A COMPANY CAN LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SHE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE IN FACT SEGREGATING PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF RACE OR GENDER. IN VARIOUS AND LONG USUALLY LOWER JOB CATEGORIES IN THE GOAL OF COURSE ISN'T THEY WILL CORRECT THE PROBLEM SO THAT WE WILL SEE MORE PEOPLE. BEING ACTIVE AND I COMMEND THE MINORITY LEADER SHE KNOWS THAT THE FIVE LEADERS OF HER COMPANY WERE ALL WOMEN SO THERE WAS NO GUESSING THERE YOU DON'T HAVE THE GAS- AND- IF YOU HAVE A COMPANY AND YOU THINK YOUR- TOP. TEN OF YOUR TOP EXECUTIVES ARE FEMALE BUT ONLY ONE IS THE WAY MISTER BENNY OFF DISCOVERED HE WAS IN FACT NOT MEETING HIS OWN EXPECTATIONS. OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THAT PROBLEM. WITH THAT ARE GOOD RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR- THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S INSPECTOR CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN I LETTER OR I ATKINS AYE BATES. NO BELL I FOR JUST NO BRADFORD. CABALLERO I CHIANG. DALLY NO DODD- I RAZA. I GALGIANI FIVE GLAZER. GONZALEZ I GROWTH. NO HERTZBERG. HELLO HI HUESO HI TADO. I JACKSON I JONES. NO LEYVA AYE MCGUIRE BYE BYE MELENDEZ NO MITCHELL. MONNING I MORE LOCK NO MORALE. NO NIELSEN NO HAN I PORTANTINO. HI ROSS I RUBIO I SKINNER. I STERN I AM VERY I WHITE HOUSE SKI I WIENER I WILK. MOVING A CALL WE WILL MOVE ON NOW TO A FILE ITEM FORTY EIGHT SENATOR UMBERG MADAM SECRETARY. PLEASE READ. SAN BILL NINE EIGHTY BY SENATOR UMBERG AND ACTUALLY TO PRIVACY SENATOR UMBERG THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM PRESIDENT IN. MEMBERS MANY OF US. PROVIDED SPECIMENS FOR PURPOSES OF DNA ANALYSIS WE COULD FIND OUT ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING THINGS YOU CAN FIND OUT WHO YOU'RE RELATED TO YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT GENETIC PREDISPOSITIONS. YOU CAN FIND OUT THAT YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF YOUR DNA THAT'S DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE NEANDERTHALS. AND YOU CAN FIND OUT TO YOUR SPOUSE IS NOT SURPRISED. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THOUGH. THAT I FOUND OUT ABOUT WAS THIS PAST DECEMBER WHEN I READ A MEMO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND LET ME. MADAM PRESIDENT BY MIGHT READ WITHOUT OBJECTION. WHERE THIS MEMO DISTRIBUTED EVERY MEMBER WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SAYS. THERE'S AN INCREASED CONCERN IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THAT OUTSIDE PARTIES ARE EXPLOITING THE USE OF GENETIC DATA FOR QUESTIONABLE PURPOSES. INCLUDING MASS SURVEILLANCE AND THE ABILITY TO TRACK INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT THEIR AUTHORIZATION FOR AWARENESS. SO THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE DIRECT TO CONSUMER ENETIC TESTING. FACILITIES PROVIDE THAT SERVICE THAT. THEY CAN FOR EXAMPLE SELL THAT MATERIAL THEY CAN DISTRIBUTE THAT MATERIAL. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS SIMPLY SAYS THAT THEY CAN STILL DO THAT THEY JUST NEED TO HAVE YOUR CONSENT AND INFORMED CONSENT SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE CONSENTING TO YOU CAN CONSENT TO COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION FACT THEY CAN PAY YOU IF THEY WANT TO ALLOW THEM TO SELL THAT MATERIAL. YOU CAN CONSENT TO RESEARCH PURPOSES THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES IS IT REQUIRES THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO PROVIDES THAT SAMPLE PROVIDE CONSENT IN FACT MOST OF THE REPUTABLE DIRECT TO CONSUMER DNA ANALYSIS COMPANIES DO THAT ALREADY BUT THERE ARE A FEW OUT LIARS WHO DO NOT IN THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS YOU GOT TO GET INFORMED CONSENT. HI VIRGIN AYE VOTE. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM WAS SERVED TO IS OUR DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR BORCHERS. PRESIDENT OF A QUESTION POSED TO THE AUTHOR IF YOU TAKE A QUESTION CENTER ON BURKE I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE A QUESTION FROM SENATOR FROM FRANK WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU I THINK THIS IS. A GOOD PIECE OF LEGISLATION JUST A CLARIFICATION SO FROM WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT STANDPOINT- WOULD A LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS INFORMATION. BY IF THERE WAS A DUE PROCESS COMPONENT TO IT OR IS THERE DUE PROCESS CANNELLA THAT THAT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION CENTER AND WHEN WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW. TO CREATE A PROCESSES THEY CAN ENGAGE- BUT- WOULD REQUIRE SOME SORT OF A SUBPOENA OR SOME SORT OF OTHER PROCESS NOT SIMPLY. ALLOWING A COMPANY THAT DOES DIRECT TO CONSUMER DNA ANALYSIS TO TURN OVER THEIR DATABASE. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S IMPORTANT SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOL. AND WE'RE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH LONG FORCE MAKE SURE THAT THEY- HAVE REASONABLE ACCESS WITH. SOME PROCESS IN PLACE. THE REASON WHY I BRING THIS UP ON. STEM CELL RESEARCH FOR AFTER A WOMAN HAS GIVEN BIRTH THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE SOME OF THE REMAINDER OF WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE- RESEARCH IS GOING TO GO BUT PEOPLE PAY MONEY TO FREEZE- SOME OF THIS ON PHYSICAL MATERIAL. IN THE IDEA THAT IT CAN BE BROKEN DOWN AND ANALYZED AND MARKETED- WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT DOES NOT SEEM FAIR- SO- I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE- TO- TO WORK WITH LONG FOR SOME MAKE CERTAIN THAT. THERE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS IN PROTECTIONS IN PLACE WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO DO THEIR JOB BY THIS IS A GOOD PIECE OF. LEGISLATION. THANK YOU SIR BORCHERS SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR JUST TO CONFIRM- IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE A QUESTION WOULD YOU TAKE A QUESTION SURE SIMILARLY TO MY COLLEAGUE IN FRESNO- DNA HAS BEEN USED TO FREE THOSE FALSELY ACCUSED. RIGHT BY A WITNESS TESTIMONY AND SOMEBODY IS SERVED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME IN PRISON IN DNA IS FREEDOM. A DNA LIKE MY COLLEAGUE SAID AT A FRESNO HAS ALSO- CONVICTED MANY- BECAUSE THE DNA FOR RAPE. MURDER ANY OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED THAT ARE JUST AN- ATROCITY TO OUR SOCIETY. SO I GUESS YOU KNOW JUST LIKE THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER YOU KNOW THAT WAS HERE THAT'S GOT I JUST RECENTLY RATES GOING TO BE. I DON'T KNOW SOMETIMES ANNOUNCEMENT AT SAC STATE. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT YOU DID SAY YOU WERE WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT I GUESS I WOULD WANT YOUR COMMITMENT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. OR JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS TRYING TO FREE. A PEOPLE WHO ARE WRONGLY CONVICTED. SO JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ARE TRACKING TO CONVICT THE RIGHT PEOPLE. BASED ON DNA WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL AT ALL. THEN PRESENT. YES SENATOR IF I MIGHT RESPOND OF COURSE IS PRESENT- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN A IS AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOL VOTE TO CONVICT AS WELL AS TO A QUICK. END TO EXONERATE- YES THE CHALLENGES THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. IT WAS USED IN THAT MATTER TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE BROUGHT SOMEONE A SECURE KILLER TO JUSTICE- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT STILL ACCESSIBLE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT NOT SUCH THAT. WE SIMPLY TURN THE DATABASE OVER TO A THIRD PARTY SO FOR EXAMPLE- AS I MENTIONED THE- MOST PROMINENT THE MOST PROMINENT. COLLECTORS OF DNA AND THOSE WHO ANALYZE THE AND I HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE WHICH REQUIRES OTHER SUBPOENA. I PERSONALLY THINK A SEARCH WARRANT IS TOO MUCH BUT BUT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME MIDDLE GROUND WHERE THERE'S A REASONABLE PROCESS SO THAT THEY CAN ACCESS THAT INFORMATION AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. SO LIKE USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER ON MY OWN TIME I GUESS HUSING EXAMPLE AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IN YOUR CLOTHES IF I'M WRONG. IF THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GET THAT DE ANNE THEN THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONVICT THIS PERSON THAT HAD RAPED AND MURDERED SEVERAL WOMEN. BUT UNDER. THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION- THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THAT. INFORMATION BECAUSE IN YOUR STATEMENT YOU SAID THAT. THE PERSON SO THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER WOULD HAVE TO AUTHORIZE THE RELEASE. OF HIS DATA. WHICH I REALLY DON'T THINK THE GOLDEN STATE KILLERS GOING TO AUTHORIZE. THE RELEASE OF HIS DATA THAT HE KNOWS THAT WOULD CONVICT HIM. I COULD BE WRONG. BUT I DON'T THINK SO. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT. WITH THIS BILL I BELIEVE. I REALLY DO BELIEVE I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GOING I THINK IT'S A PRIVACY ISSUE. BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL HINDER. JUSTICE FOR THOSE THAT- WANT TO GO FREE. AND I THINK IT WILL HINDER. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I DON'T THINK SOMEONE LIKE THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER WHO IS RAPED. AND MURDERED SEVERAL WOMEN. IT'S GOING TO AUTHORIZED THEIR DNA TO BE RELEASED FOR TEST. SO I WOULD URGE ANO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR GALGIANI. I'M GOING TO REFRAIN FROM VOTING TODAY ON THIS MATTER BECAUSE I NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS ISSUE BUT I CARE ABOUT IT VERY DEEPLY. I CARE ABOUT THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER BUT I ALSO CARE ABOUT. MISSING PERSONS INCLUDING MY COUSIN DINO WHO WENT MISSING. WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WHO STILL HASN'T BEEN FOUND. AND DURING THE BY WE'VE BEEN ON BREAK FOR CORONA VIRUS FOR CASE MY COUSINS CASE WAS REOPENED. AND I WAS CONTACTED BY DETECTIVE AT THE STARTED BABY. ABOUT A CASE BECAUSE IT WAS LEARNED THAT SOMEONE WHO IS A FRIEND OF HERS. WHO WENT MISSING A YEAR EARLIER AND WAS FOUND A FEW MONTHS LATER- DEAD AND- WELL HER PERPETRATOR HAD NOT BEEN CAUGHT THERE WAS DNA THAT WAS LEFT IN THAT NOW THERE'S A POTENTIAL CONNECTION. TO MY COUSIN I DON'T WANT ANY DOORS FACT FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE MISSING LOVED ONES WHO HAVE YET TO HAVE THEIR THEIR KILLER BROUGHT TO JUSTICE AND I WILL I WILL USE ANOTHER EXAMPLE- MANY OF YOU WHO REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY HAD NEVER TO SERIAL KILLERS IN MY DISTRICT. WHO ONE WAS BEING PULLED AND OBTAIN MY DISTRICT AND WE WERE FIGHTING THE PULL IT WAS LEARNED LATER THAT THEY HAD MANY OTHER VICTIMS AND WESLEY SHERMAN TIME STARTED TELLING WHERE THE VICTIMS WERE BURIED. IN A WELL IN RENDON HAND THEY WERE CONVICTED OF FIVE MURDERS ORIGINALLY AND AT WESLEY SHERMAN CONSTRUCTION THREE MORE INDIVIDUALS AND A BABY WERE FOUND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL. LESLIE SHERMAN TIME. WAS CONVICTED OF THE MURDER CHEVY WHEELER NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHEN DNA WAS NOT AVAILABLE. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL FOURTEEN YEARS LATER FOURTEEN YEARS LATER AND MANY MANY MORE INDIVIDUALS WERE KILLED. THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO USE THE PREVIOUS DNA THAT WAS COLLECTED NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. TO BE ABLE TO STOP SHERMAN TIENEN HERSELF FROM KILLING MORE INDIVIDUALS SO- I AM NOT GOING TO BE VOTING FOR THIS TODAY I NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT. I MADE VOTE FOR IT AT THE END BUT THESE ARE THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE ABOUT THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DEL MONTE SENATOR DOLLINGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WOULD. FOR FIVE AND A SUPPORT THIS BILL HI THIS WHICH SHARE REAL QUICK THAT I HAVE THE ANCESTRY DOT COM PACKET THAT MY FAMILY BOUGHT ME FOR CHRISTMAS THREE YEARS AGO STILL SITTING IN THE DOOR I HAVEN'T USED. JUST FOR THIS REASON I DON'T WANT MY INFORMATION TO BE SOLD OR MARKETED TO SOMEBODY ELSE SO I THINK THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE A THEIR OPPOSITION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT I SEE- SO BUT I AM I WAS WONDERING IF ME CONGESTION YOUR CLOTHES- WHAT ABOUT THE TEST FOR COVERT IN THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE GATHERING- BY THE MILLIONS- NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT NATIONWIDE AND WORLDWIDE. THANK YOU AND I ASSUME THAT THE- SENATOR WILL CONSIDER THAT QUESTION IN THIS CLOSE IS THERE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING ON SENATOR UMBERG YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU BUT LET ME ADDRESS THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT ARE RAISED UP THE FIRST WITH RESPECT TO THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE SOMEONE WHO'S ARRESTED THE CONSENT TO HAVE THEIR DNA TAKEN. THAT THAT ISSUE IS DONE IN RESULT. THIS DOESN'T REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF ANYONE WHO FOR EXAMPLES BEEN CONVICTED. TO PROVIDE THEIR DNA THAT'S ALREADY RESOLVED. WHAT THIS DOES IS IF YOU'RE A THIRD PARTY AND YOU SUBMIT YOUR SAMPLE TO A DIRECT TO CONSUMER. DATA ANALYSIS DNA ANALYSIS COMPANY. YOU'VE GOT A CONSENT TO ALLOW IT TO BE IS NOW LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU'RE NOT. WE WON'T REQUIRE YOU TO CONSENT TO HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT WE ARE GOING TO. REQUIRE MUCH LIKE THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THE ADMINISTRATION CURRENTLY IN POWER. RECENTLY SAID IF YOU'RE GETTING FEDERAL FUNDS YOU CAN'T JUST TURN OVER THE DATABASE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN'T JUST ASK FOR THE DATABASE AND GIVE THE WHOLE DATABASE. AND THEN START USING IT FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE. THAT SOMEONE HAS A PRIVACY INTEREST WHEN THEY BUY A DNA ANALYSIS K&lt;c.cyan&gt;. SO IT WOULDN'T.&lt;/c&gt; THE SITUATION THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBED WITH RESPECT THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER ONE HE WASN'T REQUIRED TO GIVE CONSENT TO HAVE HIS DNA AND ANALYZED IT WAS RELATIVES THAT THAT THEY FOUND. IN ANOTHER DATABASE THAT THAT THE CONNECTING ROOMS BAKER. END UP. WE ALSO SENATOR DOLLY EXCELLENT QUESTIONMY STAFF TO BE PROUD OF YOU BECAUSE I DIDN'T MENTION MY TALKING POINTS THAT THIS HAS EVEN A MORE DIRECT APPLICATION TODAY BECAUSE ALL THOSE ARE BEING TESTED FOR COVERT NINETEEN THAT THAT MATERIAL WHILE IT'S FAR IN A NOT DNA IT'S THE SAME MATERIAL AND SO YOU CAN BE CONVERTED TO DNA. AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE SOME PRIVACY PROTECTIONS- I HEARD TONIGHT WILL THANK YOU. CAPTION CONTROL WELL DEBATE HAVING CEASE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THEN SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL NINE NINETY FIVE BY SENATOR ATKINS AND ACTUALLY INTEND BY MENTAL QUALITY SENATOR ATKINS. MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE RISING PERCENT SB NINE NINE FIVE. WHICH EXTENDS THE SUNSET OF EXISTING CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT OR SEEK WHAT STREAMLINING PROVISIONS AND ENABLE SMALL SCALE HOUSING PROJECTS TO BENEFIT FROM THE STREAMLINING AS WELL. SB NINE NINETY FIVE AS PART OF THE WORK DONE ON A HOUSING PRODUCTION PACKAGE OF BILLS TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEED FOR HOUSING SUPPLY IN OUR STATE. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THE SENATE FROM SAN FRANCISCO WHOSE HARD LOOSELY ON THE ISSUE OF HOUSING PRODUCTION FRANKLY HE'S PUSHED US ALL AND MOVE THE BALL FURTHER ON HOUSING PRODUCTION THAN ANYONE IN CALIFORNIA AND QUITE A WHILE. I ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE A GROUP OF SENATORS ARE WHO WORKED ON THIS PACKAGE INCLUDING THIS BILL THE SENATORS FROM- HEALDSBURG SALINAS LONG BEACH SAN MATTEO RIVERSIDE BALDWIN PARK IN EAST LA I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR WORK. FIVE EIGHT EIGHT CLEARLY HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE ON THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE TAKEN. SB NINE NINETY FIVE I THINK IS A KEY PART OF THAT PACKAGE OF BILLS IN THAT IT ENSURES THAT SMALL SCALE HOUSING PROJECTS. ARE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR AB NINE HUNDRED PROGRAM RELIEF AND PUTS IN PLACE TOOL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO CONDUCT MORE EFFICIENT SEQUEL REVIEWS. BY UTILIZING THE MASTER AND FOCUSED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT PROCESS. IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AB NINE HUNDRED. THAT ESTABLISHED A NEW PROCESS UNDER SEQUEL TO STREAMLINE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD PAPER WORK. AND IT EXPEDITED LEGAL CHALLENGES FOR LARGE MULTI BENEFIT HOUSING CLEAN ENERGY AND MANUFACTURING PROJECTS. THAT HAVE A CAPITAL INVESTMENT OF OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AB NINE HUNDRED SUNSET ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS BILL EXTENDS AB NINE HUNDRED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND IT EXPERIENCES SO THAT WOULD APPLY TO MUCH SMALLER HOUSING PROJECTS. THIS IS SO THAT ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF THIS TOOL NOT JUST LARGER CITIES. RURAL COMMUNITIES IN OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL. FOR CURRENT AB NINE HUNDRED LAW NOW SAYS ONLY PROJECTS THE HUNDRED MILLION OR GREATER OR ELIGIBLE SB NINE NINE FIVE LOWER SET THRESHOLD TO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS SO SMALLER HOUSING PROJECTS QUALIFY. LIKE FLIES THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT HOUSING PROJECTS HAVE AT LEAST HIGHEST PERCENTAGE REQUIRED IN STATE LAW. TODAY EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED HAS RESULTED IN AT LEAST FOURTEEN SEPARATE MEGAPROJECTS REPRESENTING OVER TWO BILLION. IN INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE. TURNING TO THE INFORMATION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AND THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH THESE PROJECTS HAVE PROVIDED OVER TEN THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS AND CREATED THOUSANDS OF NEW HIGH WAGE CONSTRUCTION AND PERMANENT JOBS. A MINUTES TAKEN IN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MAKE IMPORTANT UPDATES TO THE AB NINE HUNDRED PROCESS INCLUDING CLARIFICATIONS. OF PAPERWORK TIME LINES AND ENSURING THAT PROPERLY SKILLED TRADES WORKERS BUILD THESE PROJECTS. EARLIER THIS YEAR I MADE A PLEDGE THAT THERE WOULD BE A HOUSING PRODUCTION FOCUS AND LEGISLATION THIS SESSION FROM OUR SENATE. SB NINE NINE FIVE IS A KEY PART OF FEELING THAT PLEDGE TO SPUR HOUSING PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S SUPPORTED BY A BROADRANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR AYE THOSE. THANK YOU MADAM THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR WILK FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DERON SO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TO SUPPORT THE EXPEDITED REVIEW IN SEQUENCE STREAMLINING CONTAINED IN SB NINE NINE FIVE THIS WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS GET BACK TO WORK. AND CREATE MIDDLE CLASS JOBS WHILE DELIVERING MORE HOUSING TO OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEED. REQUIRING A SKILLED IN TRAIN LOCAL WORK FIRST HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN MY DISTRICT I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND THAT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS PROVIDE A PATH TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. THEY LIFT BUILDING TRADE WORKERS INTO A LIFELONG CAREER WHERE THEY ARE PAID FAIRLY PROVIDED WITH HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND EVEN IN TODAY'S CALIFORNIA A FOR THAN THE ABILITY TO BECOME HOME NO HOMEOWNERS. FROM PALMDALE IN LANCASTER SANTA CLARITA. COMMUNITY WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS. HAVE GREATLY BENEFIT IN MY CONSTITUENCY PROVIDED MORTGAGE PAYING JOBS. EVEN THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT BY PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO WORK LOCALLY INSTEAD OF MAKING THE SEVENTY MA A SEVENTY MILE COMMUTE TO DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AND THE IMPROVE THE QUALITY LIFE'S A FAMILIES BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE ABLE TO STAY IN THE COMMUNITY BE INVOLVED IN THE SCHOOLS BE INVOLVED IN YOUTH SPORTS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. PROJECTS BUILT WITH SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKERS WORK FORCE ARE USING THE LEAST AMOUNT OF WORKERS BUILT IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME. AND DONE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME SO FOR THESE REASONS I STRONGLY SUPPORT S. B. NINE NINE FIVE. THANK YOU SENATOR WILK CENTER TO ROSS OF. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I ALSO RISE TO SUPPORT- SB NINE NINE FIVE AND I REALLY. PROUD TO HAVE SERVED WITH THIS GROUP UNDER THE PRO TEM'S LEADERSHIP- BESIDES. THE FIRST GOAL OF BUILDING MORE HOUSING- AND THE ESPECIALLY OF. AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE HOUSING PRODUCTION AS A WAY TO REALLY SPUR THE ECONOMY BACK AND PART OF THE SPRING THE ECONOMY IS CREATING THESE MIDDLE CLASS JOBS. I HAVE SEEN THESE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS I'VE WORKED WITH THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO JOINED HIS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND THEY ARE QUITE EXTRAORDINARY APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT COMPLETELY TRANSFORM PEOPLE'S LIVES. SO WHETHER IT'S WOMEN ALL AFRICAN AMERICANS IMMIGRANTS UP ALL FOSTER YOUTH. THERE ARE SO MANY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BENEFITTED FROM THESE PROGRAMS AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT WERE INTEGRATING THE GOALS OF HOUSING PRODUCTION WITH THE GOALS OF THE ECONOMY AND GOOD JOB CREATION SO I THANK THE PRO TEMPORE THIS. FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR TO ROSS SO SENATOR MORE MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM SAYS. LORD KNOWS WE NEED SIX FOUR FOUR. HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND- BUT THIS BILL NINE NINE FIVE LIMITS PROJECTS TO THOSE THOSE THAT UTILIZE A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT. AND I CAN TO GET A REPORT EVERY EVERY MONTH SHOWING HOW PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN FAILING. ESPECIALLY IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS- THERE COST OVER RUNS AND EVEN JUST RECENTLY HERE IN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO AFTER REQUIRING PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS THE BIDS FOR SLURRY AND PAVING. CONTRACTS DROP BY HERE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY I WON'T GO INTO OTHER DETAILS ANOTHER REPORTS BECAUSE OF LIMITED TIME. BUT BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENT OF A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT I WILL BE OPPOSED TO SENATE BILL NINE NINE FIVE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI. MEN PRESIDENT I CAUTIOUSLY OUR RIGHTS SIDE VOTED FOR THIS BILL IN- ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE THIS YEAR WITH OUR TRUNCATED PROCESS IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING THE REFERRAL TO THE DIFFERENT COMMITTEES THAT AT THAT LOOK AT IT AND ONE OF THE- CHALLENGES IS THE- EXPEDITED. REVIEW PROCESS UNDE SEE UNDER THAT TO FLORIDA- DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN AB NINE HUNDRED- I WAS. DELIGHTED WHEN THE BILL WAS IN- APPROPRIATIONS TO SEE THE AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFY THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS WILL BE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BUSINESS DAYS BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN JUST A FEW CASES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE GONE IN THIS. IN NINE YEARS WE'VE SEEN FOURTEEN PROJECTS BUT THERE'S ONLY BEEN A FEW CASES THIS WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT THIS IS A- BIG IMPACT ON THE COURTS. AND WELL WE'VE BEEN SHELTERING IN PLACE AND COPE AT OUR CORE TIPPING CLOSE THERE'S NO TRIALS GOING ON WITH EITHER CIVIL OR OR CRIMINAL AND I A I. UNDERSTAND THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE HOUSING PRODUCTION PEOPLE THAT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL STOP THEM WE'VE- HAVE OUR OWN SENATE RESEARCH OFFICE THE VIRAL CALL THE COMMITTEE HAVE CREATED REPORTS ABOUT. THE PROBLEM MAY NOT BE SEEK WHAT MAY NOT BE THIS EXPEDITED- PROCESS IT MAYBE THE ZONING ORDINANCES THAT THEY HAVE SO- FIVE CAUTIOUSLY WILL BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY I HOPE. THAT THE AND I KNOW THAT WHEN THIS BILL GETS TO THE- ASSEMBLY SITE THAT WE LOOK AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL I KNOW THAT WE'VE THE- PEOPLE AVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE LABOR CHANGES IN THE BILL BUT THE OTHER THE THIRD BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THE COURTS WHO REALLY HAVE TO PROCESS THESE. THESE ITEMS FOR THESE CHALLENGES IF THEY DO COME UP. THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD WHICH IS GREAT FOR- THE PROJECTS ARE GOING FORWARD IT IS VERY SCARY A THING FOR THE COURTS TO BE LOOKING AT WHAT THE POTENTIAL IS FOR ALL THESE QUICK. DECISIONS THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKEBECAUSE- WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT OUR COURTS ARE NOT SET UP FOR THAT IN THE- CALIFORNIA BAR PROTECTION X. ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE REVIEW OF THESE. DECISIONS IN THE COURT'S THERE'S NO SUCH ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS SO- WITH THAT. CAUTIOUS TALE I WILL BE VOTING YES. THANK YOU CENTER Y. CASKET CERTAINLY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU ARE MADAM PRESIDENT- AND NUMBERS I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE BILL AND I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK TO THE BROADER DISCUSSION OF HOUSING THAT- THIS BILL REPRESENTS AN THEIR OTHERS. BUT LET ME OF FIRST TO ADDRESS THE POINTS FROM THIS. SENATOR FROM FREMONT THAT HE REYES. ABOUT THE- EXPEDITED REVIEW THIS BILL PROVIDES AND I'M VERY SUPPORT OF A- WE HAD A BILL- LAST YEAR- THAT I AUTHORED THAT PASSES FLOOR THAT PROVIDED FOR THAT. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY REVIEW. AT THE SAME CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF THE COURT PROCESSING OF THOSE ISSUES. BUT I WOULD SAY TO MY FRIEND. AND TO ALL OF YOU THAT IF THE ISSUE IS A WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS. AND THAT WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING THE COURTS IN THE UNUSUAL CASES WERE CHALLENGES AT A VAST THAT THEY- REVIEW IT AND PROCESS IT QUICKLY. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT IF THERE IS A NEED FOR RESOURCES TO GO TO THE COURTS TO DO THAT AND THOSE UNIQUE CASES. THAT IT WOULD BE AN EASY SELL FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE SURE THE COURTS ARE PROPERLY FUNDED. TO DO THAT IS THAT A SEQUEL CORD. NORTH SIX THE COURT SOUTH I DON'T KNOW BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PENNY. FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS A AND A MULTIPLE BENEFIT THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE. WHICH IS THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE ARE. FACING THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE REYES PREVIOUSLY AND IT. IS A BROADER ISSUE ON THE HOUSING PACKAGE. SUCH AS THIS BILL WHICH I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY. IS THE FACT THAT. WE EXERCISE OUR GREAT WISDOM ABOUT HOW WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED BY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY. IT'S GOING TO BE DONE BY PRIVATE SECTOR. INVESTMENT THAT DECIDES THAT THE RISKS ARE WORTH THE REWARDS. AND SO WHATEVER WE DO ON THIS FLOOR IN THIS LEGISLATURE IF IT DOESN'T MEET THAT. FIVE EQUALS SIGN NOTHING ELSE IS GOING TO REALLY HAPPEN. IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND APPROXIMATELY APPROVED UNITS THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW. NO LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVIEWED NO CYCLIC CHALLENGES THEY CAN BE ADVANCED. AND YOU HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHY AREN'T THEY BEING BUILT THAT'S A TWO YEAR SUPPLY TODAY. AND A LOT OF THE BILLS IN THE CRITICISMS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD OR THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE THE BLOCKAGE THEY'RE STOPPING THESE APPROVALS. AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THAT- POINTING A FINGER AT A PROBLEM THAT IS NOT SO APPARENT BUT- I KNOW THAT THE HOUSING BILLS THAT JUST THIS ONE BUT OTHERS THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING. TRY TO GO AT THAT ISSUE. OF EXPEDITING REVIEW BY RIGHT APPROVALS. AND I'M I'M FINE. CONCERNED ABOUT THAT APPROACH BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I JUST LAID OUT A MOMENT AGO. IN MY DISTRICT A FEW MONTHS AGO HI WE HAD A PROJECT FOR THIRTEEN THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS. IN THE CITY OF CONCORD THIRTEEN THOUSAND A LITTLE PROJECT. IT HAD BEEN WORKED ON FOR YEARS. AND IT FELL APART A FEW MONTHS AGO BECAUSE OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE UNION AND THE DEVELOPER. AND THE CITY DECIDED. BASED ON THAT DISPUTE THEIR INABILITY TO AGREE ON A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT AND THE DEVELOPER HAD PUT FORWARD NUMEROUS PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND IDO AGREE TO INCLUDE UNION LABOR THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT. BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT THE DECISION WAS MADE BY THE CITY TO TERMINATE THAT RELATIONSHIP. AND THAT THIRTEEN THOUSAND. HOUSING IN THE PROJECT WENT AWAY. SO WAS ANYBODY ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE CHOICE HERE NOW WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO PAY MORE WHO WOULD WANT TO THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT MATCH OUR VALUES BUT WHEN IT ALL CAME TOGETHER THAT PROJECT COMPLETELY COLLAPSED. SO IT GOES BACK TO THE REAL WORLD WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE STREET THE DECISIONS WE MAKE HERE DO THEY REALLY EVEN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND THAT'S THE CASA THAT I PUT UP. ON THIS BILL AND ON OTHERS IS THAT. IS IT REALLY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE MARKETPLACE. IF ARE ADMIRABLE AND ARE WORTHY OF GREAT SUPPORT. IF THERE'S A PROBLEM RESOLVE IT QUICKLY. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IN ONE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. SENATOR NIELSEN. MATTER PRESIDENT IF I MAY- QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR OF THIS COMMENT ON MY OWN TIME. SENATOR YES REALLY CHAIR QUESTION. SENATE OR NIELSEN PLEASE PROCEED. THIS BILL HAS AN ATTRACTION BECAUSE IT IS AT LEAST ADDRESSING MOVING SEQUEL ALONG A LITTLE BIT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME BANE. THE QUESTION IS THIS IS A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR OF FIGURE. CAN THERE BE ACCOMMODATIONS HERE FOR RURAL COUNTIES OR ANOTHER CLASSIFICATION OF COUNTIES THAT I FIND ON MY OWN. IT'S CALLED NOT THIS URBAN SUBURBAN RURAL TEN YEARS AGO I COINED THE TERM SUBURBAN ISAAC THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY ABOUT FIFTY YEARS AGO SOLANO ABOUT FORTY AND THIRTY YEARS NOW IT'S IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING FROM RURAL. TO SUBURBAN. WOULD COUNTIES LIKE THAT THE SUBURBANITES AND COUNTY THAT'S GROWING. FOR THE RURAL COUNTY WOULD THERE BE ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO BENEFIT IN THIS SCHEME. SENATOR ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I THINK THE- EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED STRUCTURE OF A HUNDRED MILLION- FOR MEGA PROJECTS PART OF THE DISCUSSION OF THE SENATORS ENGAGED IN THIS WAS. ODD WE NEED TO LOWER THAT THRESHOLD- AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IT IS ABSOLUTELY A SIZE THAT CAN FIT MANY COMMUNITIES- RURAL SMALLER COMMUNITIES ARE SO THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT. THAT WE LOWER IT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES AND INCLUDES HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ALONG WITH THAT. SO IT WOULD ABSOLUTELY. BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I THANK YOU TO THE PROGRAM AND I WOULD ENDORSE THE BILL AND VOTE FOR THE BILL BECAUSE IT IS INDEED THAT SUSTAINING SOME OPPORTUNITIES THAT KIND OF A BEEN THWARTED IN THE PAST. AND WE HAVE SOME GROWTH WE'VE GOT COUNTIES THAT ARE DECLINING AND IN AND IN POPULATIONS AND MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS AND DYNAMICS IN CALIFORNIA BUT THIS DOES AT LEAST AFFORD SOME HOPE. FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT AND CHANGE THAT FOR VERY LONG TIME AND I THANK YOU FOR ALTERING THE BILL EITHER TONIGHT. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM ANY OTHER MIKE SUB THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN. SEEING ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZE SENATOR ATKINS YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL THANK MY COLLEAGUES AND- PARTICULARLY I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ON THE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORK FORCE. FROM THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SANTA CLARITA- YOU KNOW HOUSING IN PARTICULAR IS DIFFICULT IT IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ISSUES OF FINANCE. COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND CHARACTER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH ISSUES OF FINANCE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE STRUGGLED FOR DECADES- TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO DEVELOP HOUSING I'VE SPENT TWENTY FIVE YEARS FROM MY EARLIEST DAYS AS A STAFF MEMBER AND A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES ENVIRONMENTALIST. LABOR ON AND ON AND ON- AND IT'S JUST NOT EASY IT'S JUST NOT EASY TO FIND A COMMON GROUND THAT MEETS EVERYBODY'S CONCERNS- I THINK WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN. CLEARLY THERE ARE ISSUES AROUND IF WE GO TO THAT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THRESHOLD WHAT IS THAT GOING TO DO WITH THE COURTS WERE VERY. MUCH AWARE OF THAT CONCERN BUT WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO HELP EVERY PART OF CALIFORNIA. EVERY PART OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO TOOLS THAT CAN HELP. DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. OF A CRISIS WE HAVE A OF THE LACK OF HOUSING. YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE'S LL KINDS OF ISSUES THAT CAN BE RAISED BUT I WOULD JUST SAY TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY YOU KNOW OUR EXPERIENCE ON PEEL LACES ALL OVER THE PLACE WE'VE HAD A NUMBER IN SAN DIEGO THAT CAME IN ON TIME UNDER BUDGET SO I THINK IT IT JUST IT'S ABOUT THE PROJECT IN THE DEAL THAT'S PUT TOGETHER WHICH DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T CALL THOSE IN THE QUESTION AND EVALUATE- THE THING I LIKE ABOUT- INCLUDING- PARTICULARLY THE SKILLED TRADES WORKFORCE WHICH OBVIOUSLY THE COLLEAGUES. A SANTA CLARITA COMMENTED ON. IS THIS IS ALSO ABOUT JOBS AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND THE NEED FOR HOUSING. AND THE NEED TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE ACCESS. TO TOOLS THAT GOVERNMENT PUTS IN PLACE FOR THAT VERY REASON. WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMY AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR HOUSING AS WELL AS THE NEED UNDER THE ECONOMY FOR GOOD JOBS. THIS CREATES AND HELPS PEOPLE MOVE INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND IT FOCUSES THE JOBS PIECE FOCUSES ON COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN DISADVANTAGED. AND HELPS WOMEN AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY NOT HAD ACCESS TO THE IS PRINT THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. IT'S A FOCUSED EFFORT TO INCLUDE THEM. INTHAT PROCESS SO I THINK WE'VE WORKED LONG AND HARD. TO TRY TO COME TOGETHER WILL EVALUATE THIS TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM AROUND HE IS TOTALLY RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK. BACK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WATCH AS THIS PROCEEDS AND HE'S PACKAGE- THE PACKAGE OF DIFFERENT BILLS TO TRY TO. GET THE DEVELOPMENT ACTUALLY DONE NOT JUST PERMITTED. AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED AND EVALUATE WILL THIS BE HELPFUL WILL WE BE ABLE TO DO THAT- BECAUSE WE'VE SPENT DECADES ARGUING OVER WHETHER IT IS. OUR RED TAPE AND SEE WHAT. ARE THE LACK OF FUNDING. WELL IT'S ALL OF THESE THINGS AND SO I THINK THIS BILL IN LINE WITH THE PACKAGE OF BILLS IS TRYING TO GET US CLOSER ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES HOLDS ALL ACCOUNTABLE. AND SAY IT'S ALL OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO KIND OF FOCUS ON THIS AND DETERMINE IF MAKING THESE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE FINALLY BEEN PUSHED TO DO. IN THE MIDST OF A REAL CRISIS. THIS IS THE ROAD MAP AND I THINK THAT IT IS A GOOD START I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB NINE NINE FIVE. ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED MADAM SECRETARY. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A FULL HOUSE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

STANDALONE PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE FACILITIES COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION. IT DOES HOWEVER INCLUDE ALL ABORTIONS YOU KNOW WE WOULD I'M SAD AND SICKENED BY THAT BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

IN KERN IN FRESNO IN KEAN'S IN DEL ECL AREAS THESE DOCTORS ARE NOT GOING TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES BECAUSE THEY WILL GO BROKE IF THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SUPPLEMENTAL- PAYMENTS THAT COME FROM THE PROP FIFTY SIX MONIES.

THE SERVICES WILL BE PROVIDED THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ORGANIZATIONS CBO'S HOWEVER WE CANNOT PROVIDE THE LISTA CBO'S BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN DETERMINED YET THE WORST THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD WILL ENTER INTO AN INTER AGENCY INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT WITH UCLA LABOR CENTER TO CONTRACT WITH THE CBO'S THAT HAVE A DEMONSTRATED TRACK RECORD OF PROVIDING CULTURAL AND LOOT LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO SEE.

AB EIGHTY EIGHT FURTHER PUSHING SOFT ON CRIME NARRATIVE THE ONE THAT RESULTED IN THE MURDER OF THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN THAT WERE JUST MINDING THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND HAVE FAMILIES TO RAISE.

MURDERED GROSSLY MURDERED IN GREAT UNDER THESE POLICIES LIKE THIS BILL IT'S GETTING READY TO BE PASSED BY NOTHING BUT THE MAJORITY PARTY I ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- THIS IS ONE OF THE BILLS THAT ARE- FIND CALL THE FROM TO AIM AT MENTIONED IS- NOT JUST A BUDGET BILL BUT ALSO A POLICY BILL THERE'S ACTUALLY MEMBERS- I HEAVY HEAVY AMOUNT OF POLICY IN THIS BILL AND ACTUALLY AN ITEM THAT SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH A PUBLIC SAFETY AT LEAST PUBLIC SAFETY IF MAYBE NOT EVEN APPROPRIATIONS AND THAT IS DEALING WITH- CAN CONTINUING TO OUTLAW. A PARTICULAR TYPE OF FIREARM AND- I TRIED TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON THIS AND I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT WITH THE TYPE OF FIREARM IT'S DESCRIBED HERE IN THE LANGUAGE I READ THE LANGUAGE WATCHED A VIDEO READ A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE AND STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT. OF WHAT THEY'RE TOOK WHAT THE LANGUAGE IS TALKING ABOUT SO MADAM PRESIDENT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR A QUESTION IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO. ADDRESSES THANK YOU SIR JONES WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO ACCEPT A QUESTION SENATOR MITCH HAPPILY THANK THANK YOU AND BASICALLY KIND OF SET UP ALREADY. CAN YOU DESCRIBE. THE TYPE OF FIREARM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IN THIS BUDGET BILL. THAT'S RIGHT YOU'RE NOT ON BUDGET COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE HAD A LENGTHY DISCUSSION. CLARIFICATION ON IT YESTERDAY. I'M GOING TO HAVE- ACTUALLY MYSELF FIVE CHAIR I'VE GOT NOTES HERE BUT I'M GONNA ASSET MYSELF FIVE TWO YEARS STAND UP AND TAKE THE QUESTION. ON AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING I NEED TO ADD WITH REGARD TO FRANKLIN ARMORY. AND THIS BILLS EFFORTS TO PRECLUDE THEM FROM CONTINUING TO MANUFACTURE PARTS THAT CAN BE ASSEMBLED ASSAULT WEAPONS. I'M GOING TO ASK US SENATE IS GOING TO RESPOND. WITH BERMAN WITHOUT OBJECTION STARTING OFFICER THANK YOU- CALIFORNIA HAS LONG STANDING HAD IN A BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS WHICH WE HAVE. BY EXPANDED THROUGH VARIOUS- STATUTE AMENDMENTS THAT INCLUDE LIMITATIONS ON- CONVERSION KITS THAT WOULD ALLOW FIREARMS STREET TO HAVE. AMMUNITION DEVICES THAT ALLOW THEM TO SHOOT GOT MORE THAN TEN BULLETS AT A TIME A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS EACH AT EACH POINT. THAT WE HAVE FACED WHERE A MANUFACTURER HAS TRIED TO DESIGN A WEAPON IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT CALIFORNIA'S LAWS. WE HAVE COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND- AMENDED THOSE LAWS TO MAKE SURE THAT WEHAD STATUTES THAT PROTECTED. CALIFORNIANS FROM ASSAULT WEAPONS WE NOW HAVE AT LEAST ONE MANUFACTURER WHO IS GLEEFULLY ADVERTISING THEIR TYPE ONE. FIREALARM HAS CALIFORNIA ASSAULT WEAPONSSAFE BANNED THE MANUFACTURE EVEN REFERS TO THE FAR OR AS AN ASSAULT WEAPON WHAT THIS DOES IS ENABLES US TO. KEEP CATCHING UP WITH THESE MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO CIRCUMVENT CALIFORNIA'S LAW SO THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS LANGUAGE AND I WOULD ONLY SAY THAT EVERY SINGLE VOTE IN A BUDGET WHETHER IT IS DOLLARS FOR WORDS IS A POLICY ACT. THANK YOU- THAT ON YOUR OWN TIME SENATOR JONES OR YOU DON'T KNOW YEAH I DID VIçT THANK YOU I DON'T THINK I'LL BE LONG- I APPRECIATE THAT AND- LOOK WE'VE HAD SOME VERY ROBUST DEBATE ON THIS FLOOR AND IN POLICY COMMITTEES- REGARDING THE SECOND AMENDMENT. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ACTUALLY IN THE POLICY COMMITTEES. THE LEVEL OF DEBATE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE. BUT I THINK AS THE ANSWER THE QUESTION WAS ANSWERED PROVES MY POINT. THAT THIS IS HEAVY POLICY. AND YOU KNOW NORMALLY WHAT ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT DEBATE AND A FIREARM DEBATE THERE IS A LEGITIMATE CONVERSATION THAT TAKES PLACE INTHAT POLICY COMMITTEE THAT GIVES THE PUBLIC THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE THEIR OPINION- ON THIS TYPE OF ISSUE. AND SO WHILE I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S MANY. ITEMS SUPPORTABLE IN AB EIGHTY EIGHT ARE THERE HAS BEEN- NOTICE OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTABLE IN EIGHTY EIGHTY EIGHT. BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE. THIS IS. A STEP TOO FAR IN A BUDGET BILL- AS FAR AS POLICY IS CONCERNED. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO PUT ON NOTICE FOR ALL OF US. AND FOR THE PUBLIC. THAT THIS COULD BE A SLIPPER IT IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE. AND WE HAVE MADE OTICE OF THESE TYPE OF THINGS BEFORE ON THE ON THIS FLOOR REGARDING BUDGET BILLS. AND. THIS JUST GOES TOO FAR AS FAR AS POLICIES CONCERN SO I ALSO WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU. AND IF I MAY OF THROUGH THE PRESIDENT- SINCE I WAS ASKING A QUESTION JUST ADD AN ADDITIONAL A RESPONSE TO THE INQUIRY MADE. ON. AGAIN AS THE CHAIR OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SAID THERE'S NOTHING URRENT LAW PREVENTING THE SALE OF THIS TITLE ONCE HOT STYLE OF GUNS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR PROVIDING THESE FIREARMS AND HAVE AN ASSAULT WEAPON STYLE FEATURES. OF WITH REGARD TO THE ARGUMENT THAT IS NOT PURE POLICY THERE IS AN ALLOCATION THE BUDGET ALLOCATION A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLAR DEALERS RECORD OF SALE SPECIAL ACCOUNT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND A- EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND ALLOCATION TWENTY TWENTY ONE APPROPRIATE TO DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SO THEY CAN. REVIEW APPLICATIONS AND IMPLEMENT THE ABOVE CHANGES SO WITH REGARD I'M CLEAR THAT YOU'D LIKE MORE OPPORTUNITY AND I'M ALSO CLEAR THAT I SENATE TODAY OF LAST NIGHT WITHOUT MOVING. TO HEAR HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS FULL TIME ON THE ASSEMBLY BILL THE WHILE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IT MAY SHOULD HAVE BEEN POLICY. HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WERE ABLE TO CALL IN AND EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN. THE MEMBERS TO STATEN OF FLOORING HEARD THEM RABAL TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT BUT I DID WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THERE IS A ALLOCATION- ASSOCIATE WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE TRAILER BILL. AND THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL ANYTHING FURTHER SENATOR JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU AND SO TWO THINGS- FIRST OF ALL AND I MEANT TO STAND UP AND RECOGNIZE- BEGINNING MY CONVERSATION THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT WAS HERE TILL MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT I DO APPRECIATE. THE SERVICE- EVERY BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBER BECAUSE- THAT CAN GET- LABORIOUS. AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE SECOND THING I WASN'T UNNECESSARY SHARE THE STORY BUT I SURE- AND- QUICKLY AGAIN. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY ON A- SATURDAY- TO SPEND A COUPLE HOURS IN A IN A GUN SHOP- BUYING THE APPROPRIATE. CALIFORNIA COMPLAINT PARTS TO BUILD A ARE FIFTEEN. AND SO ON FATHER'S DAY. I HAD THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY WITH A FRIEND OF MINE AND- ONE OF MY SONS TO. ASSEMBLE AND- CALIFORNIA COMPLAINT A. R. FIFTEEN IT WAS ACTUALLY. A GREAT EXPERIENCE I'D NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE- ASSEMBLED MY OWN FIREARM. AND I'VE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO FIRE IT YET BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY- I'M KIND OF. GOT A **** SHOULDER RIGHT NOW. SO IT WAS- EDUCATIONAL TO ME. HOW MUCH THESE FAR ARM DEALERS HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE LAW. AND AS AS THE FARM DEALER WAS WALKING ME THROUGH THE PROCESS OF WHICH PARTS I CAN BUY AND WHICH PARTS I CAN'T BUY. IT WAS IT WAS INSTRUCTIVE AND THEY HAVE TO KNOW THE DETAIL. I MEAN MY NEW DETAILS OF WHAT'S LEGAL AND WHAT'S NOT LEGAL SO THAT THEY DON'T GET IN TROUBLE AND BY EXTENSION I DON'T GET IN TROUBLE AND SO AGAIN I JUST CLOSE WITH THAT'S WHY THESE THINGS ARE SO IMPORTANT TO GO TO POLICY COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR JOHN SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS- SINCE THIS MAY BE THE ONLY- BUDGET BILL I SPEAK TO- ME FIRST EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE BUDGET CHAIR AT HER- COMMITTEE. THE LEADERSHIP. FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON THIS BUDGET CERTAINLY THE STAFF I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN A MORE DIFFICULT TIME- IN ANY IN OUR RECENT HISTORY FOR A BUDGET TO BE PUT TOGETHER UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE- CHALLENGES THAT. FISCAL CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE CERTAINLY FACING- AND THAT CERTAINLY. A MOMENT TO EXPRESS GREAT PRAISE- TO THE LEADERSHIP. AND EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN INVOLVED IN AN. I'M NOT SPEAKING ON THIS BILL BECAUSE- THERE'S A LOT IN IT TOO TO LIGHT BUT THERE ARE A FEW THINGS IN IT THAT CAUSED ME GREAT I NEEDS. I HEAR THE- SUGGESTION THAT EVERYTHING IN THE BUDGET HAS POLICY BUT WHAT WE DO ASK IS THAT THAT THERE BE A GERMANE NECESSARY IT'S REMAIN AS TO FISCAL IN FACT FOR MEASURES TO BE INCLUDED IN BUDGET TRAILER BILLS. AND I THINK THAT- WHILE THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN ONGOING HAD BEEN DONE MOSTLY VERY VERY WELL IN THIS CASE I THINK THAT- THERE ARE A FEW PLACES WHERE IT FALLS SHORT. AND CERTAINLY FOR ME IT'S IN THE SENTENCING CHANGES IN THIS BILL. IF THE IDEA IS THAT IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT. BUDGET IMPACT. THAT SPEAKS TO THE SERIOUSNESS IN WHICH THE SENTENCING CHANGES. MAY HAVE A FAX AND I THINK THAT WOULD SPEAK TO THE NEED FOR FULL POLICY REVIEW. AND DELIBERATION SO WE CAN ALL MAKE A COLLECTIVE CHOICE. AGAIN THE BUDGET COMING AT THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND DEADLINE PROBABLY NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. THE PRESSURES ON ALL OF US THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MOST DIFFICULT- THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS FACED AND THAT'S WHY IT MAKES IT EVEN HARDER TO. GET ALL THIS INFORMATION SO LATE AND NOT REALLY HAVE THE TIME TO HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS. IRRESPECTIVE OF THE GRACIOUSNESS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO WORK LATE INTO THE NIGHT LAST NIGHT. WE KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT THE DELIVER TO PROCESS THAT IS REALLY EXPECTED OF US SO ONCE AGAIN MY APPRECIATION TO THE BUDGET TEAM I'M A VOTE FOR THE TRAILER BILL TODAY THAT'S BEFORE US BUT ONE TO EXPRESS THOSE THOUGHTS THANK YOU. SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO ALSO AFFIRMED THE JOB THAT THE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET DISTRIBUTE COMMITTEE DID LAST NIGHT DOES SHE GRACIOUSLY HANDLED AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS THE PREDOMINANT. FEELS THAT THE CALLERS WERE ASKING EVER OR TALKING TO WERE AB EIGHTY EIGHT THIS ONE. AB SEVENTY SEVEN AND SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE I JUST WANTED TO- THINKER FOR HOW TO HOW WELL SHE HANDLED OF BIGELOW. OUT TWO THINGS MADAM PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IS INFORMED US THAT THEY WOULD- STRONGLY URGE THAT WE NOT TAKE UP- AB EIGHTY EIGHT. THE BELIEVE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL REPRESENT A SEA CHANGE IN PUBLIC SAFETY POLICY AND SHOULD NOT BE APPROVED WITHOUT FULL CONSIDERATION. OF THEIR SWEEPING IMPACT IN TWO SPECIFICALLY THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT SECTION FOURTEEN WHICH ALLOWS FOR DIVERSION IN ALL MISDEMEANOR CASES WITHOUT EXCEPTION AND SO THERE'S A LOT HERE THAT WE SHOULD BE REAL CONCERNED ABOUT WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT WE DEFERRED AB- EIGHTY EIGHT. TO ANOTHER TIME THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. SENATOR NEAL. PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHO I AM DRESSING AS MUCH AS I AM MY COLLEAGUES. THIS IS ABOUT YOU THIS AFFECTS YOU. AND HUGE WHITE. NOW THIS HAS BEEN A DESTROYED NEARLY UNUSUAL YEAR. BUT WOULD BE A YEAR WHERE WE SHOULD EXERCISE. OPTIMAL RESTRAINT. BECAUSE VERY BAD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN THEY ARE RUSHED TO. AS A SOMETIMES ARE DONE IN THIS INSTITUTION. THIS IS A MAJOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY IT'S NOT JUST LIKE STUFF IT'S BIG STEP. WARRANTING IN DEPTH HEARINGS. AND POLICY COMMITTEE OR COMMITTEES IN BOTH HOUSES. THIS CALL OMMITTEES SCRUTINY ON THE FLOOR EXTENSIVE DEBATE. THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN COME CLOSE TO ACHIEVING. I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT ALL THE MORE REASON TO BE MORE RESTRAINT AND RESERVE ABOUT TRYING TO JAM MAJOR POLICY. IN SUCH A YEAR AND I WOULD ARGUE SOME OF THESE POLICIES. COULD HAVE WAITED. BUT I THINK SOME AND I DO NOT COME TO CONDEMN ANYBODY IN THE LEGISLATURE OF ADMINISTRATION FOR THIS BUT I CALL OTHER PORTIONS AND POWERS OUT THERE THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO EXPLOIT. PURSUE THEIR AGENDA NO IT'S BEEN A LONG AGENDA. OVER A WHOLE PERIOD OF TIME. AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BY VIRTUE OF THIS PIECE BY PIECE IS BEING TURNED INSIDE OUT. AND I WILL ARGUE VOCIFEROUSLY THAT WE THE CITIZENS. AND OUR FAMILIES ARE NOT SAFER AS A PRODUCT OF THIS. OVER THE YEARS AND NOW YET AGAIN IN AN ACCELERATED WAY BECAUSE THIS OPENS THE DOOR TO CALL. CLOSING TO MORE PRESENTS. ANDREA MILITATED. FORMALLY IN CUSTODY IN TREATMENT AND SOME KIND OF SUPERVISION. AND SERVING A SENTENCE JUST DESSERTS THE PUBLIC AND THEIR VICTIMS DESERVE SATISFACTION FOR NOW ARE GOING TO BE OUT. IN THE COMMUNITY. THERE IS NO QUESTION THERE'S MORE CRIME. NOW ONE OF THE WAYS UNDER REALIGNMENT IT WAS HANDLED IS A REDEFINED RECIDIVISM. A BOARD OF THE STATE RE DEFINED. DUMB THAT DOWN IF YOU WILL. THAT'S ALL MAJOR POLICY STUFF. THAT KIND OF THING HAPPENED NOT IN THE LEGISLATURE NOT AND COMMITTEES. BUT IN AN OUTSIDE ENTITY. AN AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT. I WANT TO NAME. THAT HAPPENED. WHAT'S LEFT IN OUR PRISONS NOW. WOULD BE EVEN TO THE LOCATION ADVOCATES TO. CLOSE PRISONS. IT'S THE WORST OF THE WORST OF SLAPPED. ALL THE COOL LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS ARE LONG GONE. AND WE'VE TRANSITION IN THE PRISONS FROM THE HIGHER LEVELS OF SECURITY TO THE MAIN LINE. THE VERY MOST DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE STILL IN CUSTODY. DO YOU THINK SOME OF THEM ARE NOT GOING TO SLIP OUT ON THE NATION YES THEY ARE. MY POINT IN THAT REGARD. IS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. TO HAVE SOME LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. AN IN DEPTH POLICY COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND DISCUSSIONS ON THIS. AND WE'RE IN THE PUBLIC CAN CALM AND COMMENT NOW. THIS NEW REGIME THAT WE HAVE EXPECTED. I LIKE ONE PART OF IT MORE CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE OF THE CONVENIENCE ARE ABLE COULD EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS TO THE CALL IN. BUT WE AND WE EVEN DO IT IN OUR POLICY COMMITTEES HERE THEN I THINK IT'S VERY UNSATISFACTORY IN THE DETERIORATION THE INTEGRITY INSTITUTION. IN FORMER TIMES POLICY COMMITTEE HEARINGS HAVE. LONG LONG TIME YEAH MAYBE TOO LONG MAYBE WE ALL TALKED TOO LONG WE DO. BUT THERE WERE IN DEPTH HEARINGS IN NOW WE GET THREE. TWO PEOPLE THREE MINUTES. EVERYBODY ELSE ONE MINUTE HI I'M SOLD SO I'M FOR ON AGAINST. NOW I DO NOT CONSIDER THAT. PROPER A THOROUGH PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THAT'S THE SHORT SHRIFT IN THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT NOT DO THAT. WE ARE TO DEVOTE OUR TIME TO GIVE THE PUBLIC THE MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY IN OUR SALES THE MAXIMO A COMMITTEE. TO REVIEW TO COMMENT TO ASK QUESTIONS. THE LAST NIGHT IN ONE PARTICULAR AND ONE PARTICULAR BILL. THE MEMBERS WERE MARVELOUS. AN ENQUIRING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ABOUT SOME POLICIES. THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE ANSWERS TO YET WE ARE EXPECTED TO BOTH PUT THIS INTO EFFECT AND FORCE IT UPON THE PEOPLE. AND EVEN THE FOLKS WHO CAN FEED. AND ARTICULATED THE POLICY COULDN'T TELL US WHAT WAS GOING ON. MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER TRIED MIGHTILY. TO GET SOME INFORMATION AS YET ANOTHER MEMBER. THE OTHER PARTY. THAT'S NOT GOOD BUSINESS. NOW IN OUR CASE HOWEVER COLLEGE CAMPUSES JUST FOR A MINUTE. WE DO HAVE MORE PROBLEM INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOW. WE HAVE A SH STIRRED UP POPULATION. AND THEY ARE ENCROACHING ON OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. NOT JUST THE HIGHER EDUCATION ONCE. BUT PART OF THIS BILL. WOULD ALLOW THE UNIVERSITIES CANNOT INQUIRE OF APPLICANTS OF THEIR CRIMINAL HISTORY. NOT I ARGUE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. THE PLACES WHERE OUR STUDENTS. ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME DAY AND NIGHT. AND HAVING THE INSTITUTION KNOW ABOUT IT I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT FACT I KNOW IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT HAND. ON TOP OF THAT. WE'RE GETTING READY OF THE CAMPUS POLICE DEPARTMENTS. AS WELL AS SOME ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF OUR LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THAT IS NOT. THE FORMULA FOR IN ORDER TO. PEACEFUL INFORMED AND INVOLVED SOCIETY. FOR THAT AND MANY OTHER REASONS. I WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE. SENATOR ALAN I'M JUST BE SURE MY FRIEND TO HIM I HEARD TODAY THE CAMPUS TO WERE HAD BEEN ON THE TO IN THIS BUT THAT IS BEEN CHANGED TO SOME SORT OF STAY MAYBE WE CAN GET FOR THE- AUTHOR AS THIS DOESN'T PARTICULAR. MAN MADE TO THE. OKAY I'M SO COULD I HAD FOR HEARING THE SENATOR ALLEN WE YOU WOULD YOU. THE FEDERAL RESPONSE. SHE QUESTION FOR SKINNER. YEAH AND MY FRIENDS AND HIM MENTION TO THETHAT THE TIME SCHOOL. SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THIS S. THANK YOU THERE IS NO ELIMINATION OF SCHOOL POLICE IN THE BILL. THANK YOU. A CENTER ALLEN ANYTHING FURTHER I MEAN DID YOU CAN YOU JUST CLARIFY- WHAT IS IN HERE ON THAT TOPIC. TIMES GLAD TO PULL THE HI I IT I DO REMEMBER THE X. LANGUAGE SO. OKAY IT'S A GREAT. TURN MY CALL VERY GOOD THANK YOU. A CENTER NIELSEN ON THAT POINT. IF I STILL BLIGHTED MEAN TO THAT THE BILL REQUIRED I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE GENERAL MOVEMENT IN SOCIETY TODAY AND I WILL CLARIFY THAT POINT HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE THERE WILL BE PRESSURES ON OUR CAMPUSES TOWARDS THAT END AND I'M TAKING IT IN THAT CONTEXT IT BY ALLOWED MYSELF TO THIS MISUNDERSTOOD MY APOLOGIES THANK YOU AND IF I COULD REMIND EVERYONE PLEASE DIRECT YOUR COMMENTS TO THE ACTUAL BILLS THAT WE ARE. DEBATING THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR- BRADFORD FORTUNER SKINNER DID YOU WANT TO ELABORATE ON THAT. PLEASE AND THEN SENATOR BRADFORD CHEDDAR SKINNER- BUT NOW I'M JUST A GUIDE. GENERAL POINT IN TERMS THE DISCUSS SO FOR. A THAT IS THAT HI. THE LARGEST FOR DIRECTOR IN A BUDGET TRAILER THE TO A PLAN FOR SINGLE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. YEAH THAT BUDGET SIGNED THE ADMIN OF COURSE CHANGE WE HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR BUT IN THAT PROCESS THEY'VE BEEN DEVELOPING THE PLAN. AND AS A RESULT IN THIS BUDGET AND THE GOVERNOR MADE IT CLEAR FROM BOTH JANUARY AND NOW. HE IS SET GOALS FOR CERTAIN DATES FOR PRISON CLOSURE WITHIN. A INITIAL DATE AND THEN THE SECOND ONE FOLLOWING. IN ORDER TO DO THAT THERE HAS TO BE POPULATION REDUCTION NOW. AS MOST PEOPLE I THINK WOULD AGREE THAT TO ACHIEVE POPULATION AND WE'RE JUST MEANT JUST BY RANDOMLY SAYING X. NUMBER OF PEOPLE SHOULD JUST BE RELEASED. WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE WISEST DECISION REGARDING PUBLIC SAFETY SO INSTEAD THERE ARE A VARIETY OF MEASURES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE WHOLE SET OF BOTH RECIDIVISM REDUCTION MEASURES CREDIT- FIFTY SEVEN CREDIT ISSUES THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT ARE IN THIS PARTICULAR TRAILER BILL THAT WILL ASSIST ACHIEVING. IN IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS PUBLIC SAFETY THE TYPE OF POPULATION REDUCTION THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE PRISON CLOSURES WHICH THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF FIRST DIRECTED. BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND SO OF THESE ARE. ARE FOR THAT PURPOSE AND SO THEY DO HAVE A BUDGETARY CONNECTION BECAUSE WE WOULD FACE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE WOULD HAVE TO IF WE WANTED TO MEET THESE GOALS OF THE PERSIAN CLOSURE BY A CERTAIN DATE. AND WE HAD NOT HAD THE APPROPRIATE POPULATION REDUCTIONS WHICH I WILL NOTE THAT CRIME IS DOWN AND THERE ARE NATURAL POPULATION REDUCTIONS AS WE'VE SEEN OVER TIME. BY TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT INCREASE POPULATION THROUGH RECIDIVISM THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MEASURES IN HERE AROUND THEIR CREDITS AND VARIOUS THINGS LIKE THAT. THANK YOU SO SKINNER SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR AND I WANT TO THIS MEASURE HERE AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM TEAM CAME UP BECAUSE I THINK HE'S JUSTIFY WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT WE DID FORTY YEARS OF TOUGH ON CRIME ANY MAKES ARGUMENT THAT CRIME IS UP EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT. IF CRIME IS UP AND WE'VE HAD FORTY YEARS OF TOUGH TOUGH ON CRIME THE WAY WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAS BEEN A DISMAL FAILURE I WOULD THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE SO I THINK IT'S TIME FOR RESET WE HAVE BUILT MORE PRISONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE BUILT. UNIVERSITIES AGAIN WE INCARCERATE MORE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA MORE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD YET YOU SAY WERE NO SAFER SO WHY WOULD WE WANT TO REASSESS HOW IT IS THAT WE ADDRESS CRIMINAL JUSTICE HERE IN THE STATE HOW DO WE DRESS CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN THIS NATION. THE CLOSURE PRISONS IT SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF US INCARCERATING PEOPLE DOES NOT REDUCE CRIME ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN INCARCERATED ARE BLACK BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AGAIN WHO HAVE BEEN OVER CHARGE MANY TIMES FALSELY ACCUSED. AND FALSELY PROSECUTE. AND REALITY. SO I THINK YOU MADE A GREAT ARGUMENT WHY WE SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER APPROACH I THINK THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT MEASURE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND I US RIVAL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DEBATER DISCUSSION CHINGAND HEARING NONE SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT AND I I'M I'M GOING APOLOGIZE TO YOU UP FRONT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU- FAST AT LEAST FOCUS OUR COMMENTS ON THE BILL AT HAND BUT I. FEEL AN OBLIGATION TO RESPOND TO MY BUDGET COMMITTEE VICE CHAIR. CAN I RESPOND BY SAYING THIS. I APPRECIATE THE VICE CHAIR STANDING WITH ME HE'S ALWAYS THERE FOR THE LONG HOURS WE HAVE THESE COMMITTEES AND NEVER WAVERS I APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP AND I WILL HAVE TO SAY THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FOR TO HAMMER A FEW IF NOTHING ELSE HE'S CONSISTENT. AND CONSISTENTLY MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HIM EVERY YEAR WHETHER WE HAVE ONE MONTH OF THE DELIBERATE THE BUDGET OR SIX MONTHS. HE'S CONSISTENT. I HAVE TO REMIND US ALL. WE MAKE UP THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. AND SO PEOPLE ARE FEELING YOU KNOW AS THE KIDS SAY SOME KIND OF WAY ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE NO LONGER ENGAGE IN A DELIBERATE TO PROCESS THEN WE SHOULD DELIBERATE. IT'S UP TO US. I HAPPEN TO SERVE ON BOTH PUBLIC SAFETY ENSURE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND SPEND HOURS UPON HOURS NOT ONLY IN COMMITTEE. PREPARING MYSELF FOR DELIBERATION THESE BUDGET TRAILER BILLS HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WEBSITE SINCE MAY WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT LAST NIGHT WITH MY COMMITTEE MEMBER SAID WELL YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T SPEND HIS LEISURE TIME PERUSING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A WEBSITE SO HE WASN'T AWARE WILL OF THE YOU'RE GOING TO BE A BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBER THAT'S ERHAPS WHAT WE SHOULD DO. THIS WAS A INTER NATIONAL PANDEMIC. AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THE LUXURY TO SAY WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ IT ALL AND CATCH UP TO EFFECTUATE A BUDGET WE DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY. FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE COUNTING ON US TO FIGURE IT OUT. TO DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO READ AND PREPARE AND CAST VOTES THAT YOU BELIEVE ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE RESIDENTS YOU. REPRESENT SO THAT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF OUR DELIBERATION AND IF THERE IS A- REAL BELIEVE. THAT THE DELIBERATIONS OF THIS BODY ENGAGES IN AREN'T ADEQUATE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SPENT SOME TIME DURING IN A ROOM. HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE LEADERSHIP ABOUT WHAT WE'RE WILLING TO DO AS INDIVIDUALS TO PUT OUR SHOULDER TO THE TO THE CORNERSTONE TO DO BETTER. I'LL BE THE FIRST ONE IN LINE TO STAND UP TO SAY I STAND WITH YOU. AND I THINK I EXIT BUT THAT EVERY DAY AS MY CHAIR WOMAN SHOULD WITH THE BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE I SERVE ON. AND I BELIEVE ALL THOSE OTHERS. I CAN DO THE SAME. WITH THAT MADAM PRESIDENT. I WE CLEAR FIVE BUT IT IS NOT IN THIS TRAILER BILL ANY REFERENCE TO SCHOOL POLICE- THAT WAS NOT ACCURATE- I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS MADE BY MEMBERS OF THE CLARIFICATION BY OUR SUB CHAIR ABOUT THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT THE ISSUE OF A PRISON CULTURES HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. THE NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE PRISON EXPERIENCE THE NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ARE THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN PRISON THAT SHOULD BE. NO ONE ON THIS FLOOR WOULD QUESTION WHETHER NOT SOMEONE WHO STAB SOMEBODY WITH A FORK. NEEDS TO SERVE TIME NOBODY WOULD QUESTION THAT THEY OBVIOUS THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVING TIME- BASED ON. HISTORIC PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT WAS APPROPRIATE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE THE FIELD OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE HAS CHANGED BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND RESEARCH. AND THE POLICIES BUT BEFORE THIS BODY HAVE KEPT UP WITH THAT. THAT'S WHAT A DELIBERATE OF LEGISLATIVE BODY IS SUPPOSED TO DO I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE.

IT EXTINGUISHES ALL GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS THAT ARE NO LONGER NEEDED IN ORDER TO SAVE ON ON GOOD ADMINISTRATION OF MINIMAL REMAINING BALANCES THAT ARE NOT ENOUGH TO SUPPORT ANOTHER PROJECT THAT AUTHORIZES THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO ISSUE A SORT OF CERTIFICATE OF STICK OR STATEMENT WHICH IS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL LOS BEFORE COMPLETION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS AND IT INCLUDES OTHER CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT THE BUDGET ACT ASKING FOR NOT. THANK MITCHELL BETA. SENATOR GROW FOLLOWED BY SENATOR NELSON THANK YOU MADAM HIGHER IS IN OFFICE OF HAD NINE TWO OR AB TWO- BOTH I GUESS BOTH BILL NUMBERS WOULD APPLY THIS INCLUDES A PROPOSAL TO ALLOW THE STATE WATER BOARD TO CURTAIL FEDERAL REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE CLEAN WATER ACT. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ASSAULT ON OUR WATER SO FOR. CAL IS BLESSED TO BE ABLE HAVE THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE NATION. WHEN I SAY IN THE NATION THERE IS NO JOKE IN FACT OVER THAT IN THIS NATION OVER A THIRD OF THE VEGETABLES PRODUCED IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ARE PRODUCED IN FRESNO KERN AND TULARE COUNTIES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NATION'S BEST STONE FRUIT CITRUS FRUITS CUTIES HALOS- PEACHES ANY TYPE OF STONE FRUIT OR CITRUS FRUIT AND NETS GROWN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ACTUALLY PRODUCE 99% OF THOSE PRODUCTS ARE COMMODITIES. 99% SO WHEN YOU THINK OF THE IMPACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ON FOOD SECURITY AND THE WORLD'S FOOD SUPPLY. IT'S VERY VERY IMPACTFUL WE'RE THE SOLE PRODUCER OF THE COUNTIES FOODS AT THE COUNTRY'S FOODS LIKE ALMONDS ARTICHOKES ALL IS WELL LET'S PISTACHIOS RICE GARLIC IN MORE. WE PRODUCE 99% OF THE NATION'S SUPPLY OF THOSE FOOD PRODUCTS THAT I JUST IN- MENTIONED. FOOD SECURITY FOR FAMILIES DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA FARMERS TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE FOOD. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT JOBS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT IS DEBATED ALL THE TIME WHEN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY ESPECIALLY THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE ATTACKS ARE FOOD PRODUCTION FARMERS. THIS IS ABOUT FOOD SECURITY FOR THE NATION AND PARTS OF THE WORLD. WELL THE PRINT WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE PRIORITIZING FOOD SECURITY IN THE LONG RUN STATE LEADERSHIP IN CURRENT IN RECENT PASSED IN THIS BODY HAS CONTINUALLY. ATTACKED FARMERS AND FOOD SECURITY FOR OUR NATION AND PART OF THE WORLD. AN ATTACK ON FARMERS IS AN ATTACK ON OUR FOOD SUPPLY. THE ASSAULT ON OUR FARMERS HAS GOT TO STOP AGAIN THIS IS MORE THAN JOBS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THIS IS ABOUT PRODUCING A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PRODUCTS OR COMMODITIES IN THE FARMING WORLD COMMODITIES THAT ARE PRODUCED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE NATION. THIS BODY THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE HAS THE ABILITY TO DISTRACT THE NATION'S FOOD SUPPLY WITH BILLS LIKE THIS. THE CREE TAIL WATER FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND IT'S BEYOND ME WHY THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT STEPPED IN TO STOP. THIS BODY FOR STRICTLYIN THE NATION'S FOOD SUPPLY FROM PEOPLE AND CREATING FOOD AND SECURITY ESPECIALLY FOR THE COLBERT SITUATION WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES IN WHERE PEOPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT GOING TO THE GROCERY STORES. TO MAKE SURE THEY AND FOOD FOR THEIR FAMILY. CALIFORNIA PRODUCES THE FOOD THAT CREATES FOOD SECURITY AND BILLS LIKE THIS WILL STOP THAT FOOD SECURITY FROM GOING TO OUR GROCERY STORES AND I DESPERATELY URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR KNEELS. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND OF THE CENTER I DO URGE THE NO VOTE ON THIS AGAIN. IT'S A PART OF A CONTINUING TREND. WHERE IN THE END MINISTRATIONS FOR ALL IN THE LEGISLATURE'S PEARL HAVE ACCORDED MORE AND MORE POWER AND AUTHORITY TO AGENCIES OF STATE GOVERNMENT IN THIS CASE AN EXAMPLE BEING THE WATER BOARD. MORE POWER. TO CONTROL OUR LIVES MORE POWER TO IN EFFECT TAX THROUGH LEVYING FEES AND BROADENING THE APPLICATION OF THOSE FEES. TIME AND AGAIN WE HAVE FOUND OUT WHEN WE CHALLENGE. THE AGENCIES PEARL DIXIE THEIR STATUTORY AUTHORITY. AND THE FACT THROUGH FIAT OR MEMO OR DEAL LAND DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL MEMEL. DAVE AFFECT POLICY WHICH IN EFFECT LEGISLATION. UNLESS IT IS LITIGATED THEN IT STANDS. SOMETHING WAS CREATED HERE MANY YEARS AGO I WAS A PART OF THAT WITH THE SPEAKER AT THE TIME LEO MCCARTHY THE ADMINISTRATORS PROCEDURES ACT. WHICH ENSURED THAT AGENCIES COULDN'T JUST THE PEOPLE THAT THERE HAD TO BE A PROCESS PROMULGATING POLICY IN IMPLEMENTING POLICY. THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE FOR TO ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. WHICH DID ALLOW PUBLIC INPUT. VERY LITTLE PUBLIC INPUT. THESE AGENCIES THESE DAYS. ARGUE WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. IN THESE MANY AREAS THAT MY COLLEAGUE BAKERSFIELD AS MENTIONED. HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN ASSERTING FEDERAL AUTHORITY. OVER THE EXCEEDING OF STORY L. STATE AGENCIES. THAT'S A GENERAL OBSERVATION BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY APPLICABLE. TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AT HAND. THE PART OF THIS DOES RELATE TO SOMETHING THAT PASSED YOUR SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION. NOW THAT SEVERAL LAW AND I'M NOT ARGUING ABOUT THAT NOW. EXCEPT THAT IT'S IMPOSED CERTAIN CONDITIONS. ON A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND OUR OWN ABILITIES. THAT HAVE AFFECTED NOT ONLY AGRICULTURAL PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER. BUT INDUSTRIAL AND MUNICIPAL AS WELL. AND THE AUTHORITY THAT EVEN THERE'S EXPANDED HERE TO THE WATER BOARD. MORE. ONLY GIVES THOSE AGENCIES MORE POWER. AND WHO KNOWS REALLY WHAT GOES ON WITHIN THEM EVEN SOMEONE WHO IS PRETTY FOR STUDIOUSLY WATCHING WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND PUTTING THEM AND HAVING SOME OPPORTUNITY FRANKLY AT WHICH I APPRECIATE TO IMPORT THOSE BOARDS. BUT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN DOES NOT. THEY HAVE TO. DEAL WITH THE AGENCIES. AND THE STRONG ARM TACTICS THAT SOMETIMES ATTEND THOSE. I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. BECAUSE THIS IS ANOTHER. INCREMENTAL STEPS IN ACCORDING MORE AUTHORITY AND POWER. THE WATER BOARD. SENATOR KIRBY ERROL FOLLOWED BY SENATOR WAY CASKEY. THANK YOU MADAM. PRESIDENT WE COULD SPEND ALL NIGHT HERE ARGUING ABOUT WATER. THERE'S SO MUCH TO FIND OUT ABOUT WATER BUT I WON'T DO THAT LET ME BE REALLY BRIEF FIRST I WANT TO THANK. THE CHAIR THE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR DOING AN EXEMPLARY JOB OF GETTING US THROUGH THIS BUDGET. IN THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE HAD SHE'S DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB. BUT THIS PARTICULAR- TRAILER BILL. HAS ADDITION THAT IS GOING TO DEEPLY IMPACT. THE MERCED IRRIGATION DISTRICT AND IT'S INTERESTING AND I WILL BE VOTING NO ON THIS TRAILER BILL BECAUSE WHAT THIS. PROVISION IN THE BILL DOES IS IT AUTHORIZES THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOAR. TO ISSUE A CERTIFICATE. THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW. BEFORE THE COMPLETION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT AND I WANT TO SAY THAT AGAIN BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS IT GIVES THEM THE ABILITY TO VIOLATE THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT. AND TO ISSUE A CERTIFICATE BEFORE THAT THAT- REVIEW IS FINISHED AND- AND THAT ACT. TREMENDOUSLY IMPACTS WHAT THE MERCED IRRIGATION DISTRICT IS WORKING TOWARDS WHICH IS A FEDERAL THE FEDERAL RELICENSING. OF THEIR POWER SYSTEM A HYDRO ENERGY POWER SYSTEM THAT THEY HAVE OPERATED FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS SO. TO TAKE THIS KIND OF ACTION THAT. IS HAS IT DID DELETERIOUS IMPACT ON A MAJOR ENERGY PER. IN MY REGION- FORCES ME TO VOTE NO ON THIS SO I IT'S WITH DEEP REGRET THAT I DO THAT I THINK THERE IS THE ABILITY FOR US TO WORK OUT OUR WATER ISSUES INVOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS BUT IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVERYBODY COMING TO THE TABLE AND WORKING IT OUT. SENATOR Y. CASKEY THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WILL TRY TO BE HELPFUL HERE ON FEDERAL AUTHORITY AND HOW THIS FOR OVER FOUR OH ONE CERTIFICATION PROCESS WORKS. THE LANGUAGE IS IN THIS TRAILER BILL SIMPLY PRESERVES THE STATE'S RIGHT TO REQUIRE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF HYDRO ELECTRIC PROJECTS PRIOR TO THESE PROJECTS BEING LICENSE OR RE LICENSE FOR FORTY TO FIFTY YEARS. THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE ANY NEW MANDATES IT'S SIMPLY PRESERVES THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S WRITES THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ATTEMPTING TO TAKE AWAY AT THIS MOMENT. THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION WHICH FOR. HAS THE AUTHORITY UNDER THE FEDERAL POWER ACT TO LEASE. HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECTS LOCATED ON NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS OR FEDERAL LANDS WERE CONNECTED TO THE INTERSTATE ELECTRIC GRID THESE STAMPS GREATLYIMPACT CALIFORNIA'S RIVERS AND WATERWAYS. SECTION FOR A ONE OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT PROVIDES THE MECHANISM TO REQUIRE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF THE STADIUMS TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE'S WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD'S PROTECTIVE WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS MANY FOR LICENSES MADAM PRESIDENT. NOW IN EFFECT FOR HYDROELECTRIC DAMS IN CALIFORNIA WILL GRANTED PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO SECTION FOR A ONE WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATIONS OFFERS A ONCE IN A GENERATION OPPORTUNITY. TO REVIEW THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE PROJECTS SINCE PERKS LICENSES RUN THIRTY TO FIFTY YEARS. TODAY THERE ARE MULTIPLE NEW FOR LICENSES PENDING IN CALIFORNIA AGENCIES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE ATTACKING CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO ISSUE OR DENY SECTION FOR A ONE WATER CALL THE CERTIFICATIONS IF THESE FEDERAL EFFORTS ARE SUCCESSFUL CALIFORNIA WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM ENSURING THAT DAMS WITH WIDE REACHING IMPACTS AND RIVER HEALTH. MEET STATE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS WHEN THEY'RE READ LICENSE IN THE PAST YEARS. FOR HAVING COURAGE IN THE FACT THAT THE PRACTICE OF WHICH ROWING AND RE SUBMITTING APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATION PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE ONE YEAR DEADLINE. THIS PREVENTED THE SITUATION WITH THE STATES WITH HAVE TO DENY CERTIFICATION FOR LACK OF INFORMATION AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION THE STROKE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HOWEVER HAS PROPOSED NEW RULES REQUIRE REGARDING THE CLEAN WATER ACT SECTION FOUR ONE THAT WOULD DRASTICALLY RULE BACK TO SCHOOL. OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE WATER BOARDS. OF FORTY. THREE WAVING. AT THE WERE TO OVERSEE AND WATER CALLED FOR THESE THE IS NO LONGER IN FEAR. IT REAL AND IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. LAST WEEK FOR FOUND THE STATE HAD WAVE WATER CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY FOR THE- OR SAID PROJECT LIKE MY COLLEAGUE HAS INDICATED THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS BEEN UNABLE TO PROCESS THE APPLICATION BECAUSE MERCED IRRIGATION DISTRICT HAD NOT PREPARED. OR YOU CAN COMMENCE THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT REVIEW AS THE SEQUEL LEAD AGENCY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS THERE'S GOING TO BE SEVEN. OTHER PROJECTS IN A SIMILAR SITUATION AN EXTRA EUROPE OR P. JEANNIE PROJECTS. THAT IS THE TYPE OF PROBLEM THIS TRAILER BILL ADDRESSES ITS SPECIFICALLY THE TRAILER BILL WOULD ENSURE THE STATE CAN CONTINUE TO REQUIRE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND CONDITIONS TO PROTECT THEIR OWN WHAT DOWNSTREAM WATER USES INCLUDING AGRICULTURAL IN MUNICIPAL SUPPLIES RECREATIONAL BOATERS. AND EVEN NATIVE FISHERIES AND OTHERS AS A STATE WE HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST EGREGIOUS ROLL BACKS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S ASSAULT ON STATE PROTECTIONS IF WE FAIL TO ADDRESS THIS ROLLBACK THE STATE WILL LOSE ITS AUTHORITY OVER THESE PROJECTS FOR THE NEXT. FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS. MADAM PRESIDENT. I'D LIKE TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO SOMETHING THAT'S NOT IN AB ARE NINETY TWO WHICH IS ON THE FLOOR.

SO AGAIN I URGE EVERY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES BUT I REQUEST A VERY STRONGLY THAT NO REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE SUPPORT THIS BILL. AB EIGHTY FOUR REQUIRES A HIGHWAY PATROL SUBJECT TO PAY REDUCTIONS THIS IS ANOTHER CLEAR CASE OF THE POOR PRIVATIZATION OF THIS CAPITAL. INSTEAD IS FOURTEEN ARE INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING OUR INCREDIBLE HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS THE ONE TO PROTECT THIS BUILDING PROTECT US PROTECT THE GOVERNOR. IN BEING SPENT ON WHILE THEY STOOD ON THIS LINE OUTSIDE THIS CAPITAL WITH C. MEANT WATER BOTTLES THROWN AT THEM. BEING HOSPITALIZED IN SOME CASES AND TOOK THE BRUTALITY THAT THEY STUDENT PROTECTED THIS BUILDING AND ALL OF US FOR OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS BECAUSE OF THE RIOTS IN THE INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO CAUSE HARM. AND LITERALLY MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT COMING IN TO BURN THIS BUILDING DOWN. THESE GUYS STOOD ON THAT LINE OUT THERE AND THEY PROTECTED EACH ONE OF US. THEY DRIVE AROUND IN THE PROTECT THE GOVERNOR OF THIS STATE AND THEY DO EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SAFE HERE IN THIS CAPITAL AND LAW AND ORDER IS INSTILLED ON THESE GROUNDS. THIS BUDGET GETS AWAY WITH TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOR HIGH SPEED. RAIL WHICH IS GOING NO WHERE. TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR EIGHT FIVE TO STAY PEOPLE FROM WORK IS IT THE CARD. FIGHTING DOLLARS FOR HIS PARK AND POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR BUT SERRA TO SUE% THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WE CAN GET RID OF ALL THAT OTHER NONSENSE AND MAKE SURE THOSE MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE THAT STAND TO PROTECT THIS BUILDING. HAVE THEIR PAY RAISES AND THE PAID THEY ARE ENTITLED TO INSTEAD OF CUTTING THEIR WAGES AND SO AGAIN. I KNOW THAT OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE THAT PROTECT THIS BUILDING WILL TAKE THAT PAY CUT. BUT I AM TELLING EVERYONE OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES THIS IS A NO VOTE BILL. SORRY I MENTIONED IT SENATOR GROVE. SENATOR NIELSEN. ALLOW ME LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE NOT A PRESENT TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS PARTICULAR ONE. MY OBJECTION IS SIMILAR TO OUR REPUBLICAN LEADERS CONCERNED ABOUT THE RIVER HIGHWAY PATROL. GENERATE LAWYERS CRITICISMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THERE'S PETITIONS AND THE HIGHWAY PATROL DIRECTLY F YOU SEE A RED LIGHT BEHIND YOU. BUT I'VE BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH. TO THE FRONT LINES WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS. TO KNOW WHAT THEIR LIVES ARE LIKE. AND HOW DIFFICULT THEY ARE. AS YOU DRIVE AROUND CALIFORNIA. HE REGULARLY WAS SEE SCIENCE WHO NAMING PORTIONS OF OUR HIGHWAYS. THE LOST PATROLMAN. BEFORE I WAS EVEN SWORN IN. TWO HIGHWAY PATROLMEN. IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENTED RIGHT ACROSS THIS RIVER. WERE MURDERED. THE DOCTOR NIGHT. BY AN INDIVIDUAL. TWO YEARS AGO. I GOT UP UNTIL THE NIGHT AND RED BLUFF AND I'M LOOKING OUT OVER THE RIVER. I SEE NO. LIGHTS COMING SOUTH DOWN ON I FIVE NO EVEN AT TWO IN THE MORNING THAT'S RATHER UNUSUAL. THEY WENT BACK TO BED FORGOT ABOUT IT. UNTIL SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. WHAT I FOUND OUT. THE HIGHWAY PATROLMAN STATIONED IN THIS. BE. WHOSE HUSBAND OF ONE OF OUR NATION'S. PULL THE CAR OVER JUST NORTH OF US. HE GOES TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE. HERE'S IN. CHOOSE A WEAPON. HE ASKS. THE MAN TO GET OUT OF THE CAR WHICH SHE DOES DUTIFULLY BUT IS IT DOES SHOW THE DRIVER WHEELS AROUND. THE CHIU C. OFFICER. NOW HE BACKS UP AS HE IS TRAINED TO DO. TO GO BACK TO HIS CAR. NEXT CALL. THE BACK WINDOW OF THIS VEHICLE IS BLACKED OUT. WE CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. BUT HE KNOWS THE DRIVERS GOT A GUN AND HE'S SHOOTING WITH IT. SO HE- SHOOTS INTO THAT BACK WINDOW. AND THAT INDIVIDUAL MET JUSTICE VERY QUICKLY THE OTHER PERPETRATOR THOUGH IS STILL BUSY. FORTUNATELY TO RESPONDING OFFICERS COME UPON THE SCENE NOW WHY DO I BORE YOU WITH SUCH DRAMA. IT IS FAR MORE THAN DRAMA. KILL OUR FAMILY TO THAT FAMILY. THAT Y. FROM THEIR CHILDREN. THAT'S THE REAL DEAL. NOW WHAT ARE THOSE FOLKS DO IF THEY CAN RECOVER AND HE DID. THEY GO RIGHT BACK ON THE JOB. I MEAN HE DID RIGHT BACK ON THE JOB. DOING PAPERWORK FOR AWHILE AND HE'LL. AND THEN WE HAD SHOULD MENTION HERE ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO I WENT DOWN. THE END OF THE DAY. CERTAINLY THERE WAS A LOT OF ACTIVITY AROUND OUR CAPITAL. THERE SIXTEEN FOR A HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS IN OUR BASEMENT WHERE WE PARK. DRIVE OUT. MOST OF TIME WE DO KNOW ABOUT THAT. BUT IT IS A SACRIFICE THAT THEY MAKE. AND I FEEL THAT WE OUGHT NOT ASK THEM TO MAKE MANY MORE SACRIFICES FOR US CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF THEIR FUTURE AND THEIR INCOMES. SIR ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON I WAS TRYING TO PULL UP. ARMS AND THAT I JUST READ RECENTLY THAT SHOWED. THE AMOUNT OF OVERTIME THAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S PAYING THE HIGHWAY PATROL FOR THEIR SERVICE TO PROTECT AND SERVE AND SELLTHOSE MEN AND WOMEN WERE DULY COMPENSATED FOR DOING THAT JOB AND WE ALL CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THEM I'LL BE ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE IN AB EIGHTY FOUR.

ASSEMBLY BILL ONE OH FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY TAX LEVY. SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU AB ONE OH FIVE PERTAINS TO THE NON RESIDENTIAL ACTIVE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX EXEMPTION MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THE BILL DOES THE FOLLOWING IT SEEKS TO PREEMPTIVELY CORRECTLY UNINTENDED IMPACT OF THE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES FIRST INITIATIVE IN THE UPCOMING NOVEMBER BALLOT. ON NON RESIDENTIAL SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS IN THE STATE IT ENSURE THAT NON RESIDENTIAL ACTIVE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS IN THE STATE CONSTRUCTED OR INSTALL PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE POINT TWENTY FIVE. CONTINUE TO BE EXEMPTED FROM TAXATION BY RECLASSIFYING THEM AS PERSONAL PROPERTY. COMES AN OPERATIVE IN THE EVENT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE IS NOT APPROVED AT THE STATE WIDE SELECTION PRESERVING THE EXISTING LAW EXEMPTION FOR NON RESIDENTIAL SOLAR ENERGY GENERATION SYSTEMS. THE BILL DOES NOT INTRODUCE ANY NEW TAX EXEMPTION TO THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRY. VOTERS INITIALLY APPROVED THE EXCLUSION OF ACT OF SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS AND TAXATION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. AN EXISTING LAW PROVIDES THAT THIS EXCLUSION WILL SUNSET ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE BILL ONLY SERVES TO PRESERVE THE EXISTING EXCLUSION ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. DEBATER DISCUSSIONS SENATOR DOLLY THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I SPOKE ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT THIS IS ABSURD. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PRIVATE A PROPERTY TAX AND WE'RE THAT PROPERTY TAX GOES A GOES TO LOCAL COUNTIES. AND THE SOLAR INDUSTRY HAS DONE HAS BEEN IF YOU LATE AT THE LEGISLATURE FOUR YEARS ON THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE NOT PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAX WHICH FUNDS. YOUR CAN ONLY SWITCH FUNDS. DEPUTIES THEY HAVE A STRUCTURE YOUR COUNTIES ALL THE THINGS-THAT THE COUNTY SERVICES AS MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY PROVIDE AND THEY HAVE NO ABILITY BILL RAZOR TAX NOW LOOK YES WE DO INCENTIVIZE- DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENERGY WHEN IT'S CLEAN TO. OBVIOUSLY OTIS BUT WE HAVE PLENTY OF SOLAR BACK WE HAVE MORE SOLAR WE CAN POSSIBLY USING CALIFORNIA. WE ARE OUR RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING. TO OFF LOAD OUR POWER TO OTHER STATES BECAUSE WHEN THE SUN SHINING WE'RE CREATING TOO MUCH POWER AND UNTIL STORAGE EITHER BATTERY OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY IS ABLE TO STORE. THOSE ELECTRONS WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE AS CALIFORNIANS AS RATE PAYERS TO PAY OTHER STATES TO TAKE OUR ENERGY WHEN WE'RE OVER PRODUCING. THIS BILL IS X. IS IT IS EXPECTING TO SEE THIS BUT ROLE COMING AFFECTING HIS HEDGING THAT THEY'LL STILL GET. THE TAX INCENTIVE WHY IN THE WORLD WE INCENTIVIZE OF THE WE HAVE TOO MUCH UP IS BECAUSE THE LOBBY IS VERY POWERFUL IN THIS AREA. THE RATE PAYERS OF CALIFORNIA ARE GETTING THE SHORT END OF THE DEAL. AT THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT STORAGE THE ONLY WAY WE'RE EVER GOING TO REALLY DO A GOOD JOB OF GOING GREEN AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A BALANCE IS UNTIL WE HAVE STORAGE. IS SO FOR THOSE REASONS I OPPOSE THIS PIECE LEGISLATION SECONDLY IT IS NOT FITTING BE IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS THIS SHOULD BE A POLICY DRIVEN BILL. GO TO THE POLICY SHOP AND IT'S JUST A HEDGING THE BET FOR. THE ELITE PEOPLE WHO GET THE TAX CREDITS FROM THIS SO FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE IN ON THE BEHALF OF THE RATE PAYERS OF CALIFORNIA I URGE. FOR NOVA. SENATOR BOARD JUST THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- QUESTION WILL NOT CERTAIN TO WHOM MUCH OPPOSES QUESTION PERHAPS. IT WOULD BE THE PUBLIC BUDGET DIRE TO TRY TO POSTED TO THE AUTHOR SENATOR MITCHELL AND I THAT HERSCHEL I JUST I WANT TO KNOW IF THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY UM INITIALLY EXCEPT. MY QUESTION IS IN THE DRAFTING OF THIS WHEN IT WENT THROUGH LEDGE COUNCIL WAS THERE EVER REVIEW ON THE LEGALITY. OF OFFERING AN EXEMPTION FROM A REASSESSMENT. FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT HAS THIS BEEN VETTED AND FOUND TO BE LEGALLY SOUND TO MOVE FORWARD AS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION. SENATOR MITCHELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. I'M NOT WHERE OF LEDGE COUNCIL DRAFTING LANGUAGE THAT THEY WOULD DEEM UNCONSTITUTIONAL. MAYBE AS A FOLLOW UP. YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE BUT IT FORTY REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY STATE DEPARTMENT OR THE LEGAL COUNSEL THAT POSED ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THIS. HI IT WOULDN'T BE A TRAILER BILL BEFORE IF THEY DID SIR. ON YOUR OWN TIME TO CENTER. ALL OF ALL CONCLUDE HERE I APPRECIATE- THOSE ARE VERY CRYPTIC IN- NONRESPONSIVE. TO MY INQUIRY BUT MIGHT MY CONCERN REALLY IS I THINK THIS IS BEING SET UP FOR A LEGAL CHALLENGE AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE BEFORE HAD INDICATED THAT. THIS IS DEFINITELY A POLICY DRIVEN DISCUSSION FINDING ITS WAY INTO THIS- INTO THIS BUDGET I THINK IS INAPPROPRIATE BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED AND I HOPE I'M NOT A CANARY IN THE COAL MINE HERE BUT I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE CHALLENGE OF THIS MOVES FORWARD AND NOT FOUND TO BE. LEGALLY SUPPORT. AND LET ME BE LESS CRYPTIC IN MY RESPONSE TO YOU SIR. I DON'T KNOW THAT LEADS COUNCIL. WILLINGLY KNOWINGLY DRAFT LEGISLATION THAT THEY THINK IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. A COURT CAN CHALLENGE WHATEVER THEY CHOOSE TO CHALLENGES UP TO INTERPRETATION AS A CITY MEMBER THE BAR YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF THAT BUT I DON'T BELIEVE LET'S COUNCIL WE CAN COLLEGE COUNSEL HERE IF THEY COULD ANSWER IT IN A LESS CRYPTIC FORM THAT I AM BUT IT IS NOT MY EXPERIENCE THAT LETS COUNCIL WOULD PUT FORWARD LANGUAGE THAT THEY BELIEVE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. CORRECT THANK YOU. IF YOU WOULD LIKE PERHAPS WE COULD CALL PLEDGE COUNSEL IF THEY. MAJORITY LEADER SAYS NO OF. I BELIEVE MANY OF US WHO'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME AGREED THAT LEDGE COUNCIL IF THEY BELIEVE SOMETHING IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL WILL SO ADVICE YOU. IN ADVANCE OF THE PREPARATION F ANY DOCUMENT- THAT THEY BELIEVE THIS ON CONSTITUTIONAL COURSE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A COURT SYSTEM IF THERE'S A CONCERN. YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO CHALLENGE IT AND WILL HAVE HER DRESS SAID IN HER CLOTHES BUT I THINK WE DO HAVE SENATOR NIELSEN- WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK CENTER NIELSEN THE FLOOR IS YOURS. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES YOU DOWN THE SENATE THAT I WILL BE URGING A NO VOTE ON THIS ONE AS WELL WE HAD AN EARLIER MEASURE THAT WAS. PROPAGATED ON RESPONSE TO. POTENTIAL VICTORY A BALLOT PROPOSITION COMING DOWN THE PIKE HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. ELECTED US AND THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SOLAR INDUSTRY IS WELL ESTABLISHED IN CALIFORNIA LITERALLY FOR DECADES. AND I SUPPORT THE- HOWEVER IT'S WEARING A LITTLE THIN. THE THEY HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO ADVANTAGE FOR DECADES OTHER OTHER SOURCES OF ENERGY THAT WE NEED IN OUR ENERGY BASKET AND CALIFORNIA. AND ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD ATTEND OURSELVES AND DID THAT DEVOTE ATTENTION TO THOSE OTHER ENERGY SOURCES. A DIVERSIFICATION. INSTEAD OF HAVING SOLAR BEING THE NEARLY ONLY GAME IN TOWN. AND AS BEFORE IN THIS LEGISLATURE THIS INDUSTRY. BEFORE THE AXES EVEN FALLEN ON THE LAST BENEFIT ARE EXTENDING IT. OR IN THIS CASE PREPARING FOR EVENTUALITIES. THAT DOES NOT SERVE US. THE ABILITY TO FOCUS AS WE SHOULD. ON OVERALL ENERGY POLICIES. AND AGAIN I ARGUE THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. AND NO FAULT TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY NOT TO THE CHAIR. BUT SPECIAL INTEREST EXPLOIT THE OPPORTUNITY. AND THAT IN ITSELF IS WORTHY OF A NO LOW. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN MAY I PLEASE REMIND EVERYONE THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO TRY TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING. AYE RELATIONSHIP IT'S DIFFICULT- BUT- PLEASE TRY TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. SENATOR WIENER AND SENATOR BELL. CHAIRMAN. SOME SOCIAL DISTANCING PLEASE. I RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT EASY TO DO BUT IT'S STARTING TO BECOME VERY OBVIOUS THAT WE'RE NOT SO WITH THAT. SENATOR BATES. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT JUST A CLARIFICATION ON THE QUESTION ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE I DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD TO. THE RECALL ISSUE IN A TRAILER BILL AND IT DID PASS OFF THIS FLOOR AND THEN HOW TO BE. A WAS FOUND IN A COURT CHALLENGE TO BE ILLEGAL AND THEY HAD TO REDO IT OVER IN A POLICY BILL. SO WE WERE ALERTED IN THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT THAT FRIENDLY TO COUNSEL THAT THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE HONEST CONSTITUTIONAL SO I'D LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR JUST A CLARIFICATION. WERE YOU EVER ALERTED BY LEAD COUNSEL THAT THERE MIGHT BE A CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE WITH THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE NO MA'AM THANK YOU BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE GOT ON THE ON THE RECALL MEASURE. GIVEN THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE IN THE PAST WE HAD BEEN ALERTED YES AND SO I THINK THAT WAS A DIFFERENT SITUATION EXACTLY WE WERE NOT ALERTED. INSTEAD POINT OF CLARIFICATION LITTLE INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE THAT THANKS IT IT WORKS EVERY TIME. THANK YOU HI IS A FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE SEEING AND HEARING NONE. SENATOR MITCHELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I JUST RESTATE THAT THIS AGAIN IS IN CURRENT LAW IN THIS A MEASURE IS JUST PRESERVING THE CURRENT EXEMPTION THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT A NEW BENEFIT FOR THE SOLAR INDUSTRY AGAIN THAT ONLY PRESERVES CURRENT LAW OF AN EXEMPTION AT SUNSET. IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SHOULD THE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES FIRST INITIATIVE PASS. ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU- AND AGAIN SENATORS PLEASE SIX FEET. SENATOR SIX FEET PLEASE. IT'S A IT'S NOT EASY BUT I WOULD REQUEST AND IF WE CAN'T GET PEOPLE TO DO SIX FEET I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ALL TO SIT DOWN WE WILL CONTINUE UNTIL WE'VE DONE THAT. ALRIGHT WITH THAT.

ASSEMBLY BILL ONE OH THREE BY THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND ACTUALLY INTO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AB ONE ALL THREE- PROVIDES A FEDERAL CONFORMITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT ADMINISTRATION GRANTS AND TO PROVIDE UP TO TWENTY WEEKS AN ADDITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS. FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL PROVIDES FOR THE NON CHARGE OF EMPLOYERS UP FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ISSUE DURING THE CALL BUT NINETEEN PANDEMIC OF SPECIFIED. THE BILL ALSO AUTHORIZES THE USE OF THE TOTAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR THE PURPOSES OF TRIGGERING ON THE DAY ALL THEIR BENEFITS. WELL LAST NIGHT DURING BUDGET COMMITTEE SEVERAL QUESTIONS WERE ASKED- OF THE ADMINISTRATION. AND I THINK I JUST WANT TO COVER A COUPLE OF THEM. A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ASKED WHAT WAS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS PAID OUT WHAT WAS THE PROPORTION BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS IN NINETEEN TWENTY. THERE BEEN APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SIX POINT FOUR BILLION IN U. I. BENEFITS PAID OUT TO JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY. APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ARE TIED TO THE VERY FEDERAL PROGRAMS F. P. YOU SEE THE P. WAY AND THE P. E. YOU SEE. AND TWELVE POINT SEVEN BILLION IS FOR REGULAR YOU WHY. AFTER YOU SEE THE ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WEEK P. WAY AS THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND P. E. YOU SEE IS THE THIRD THIRTEEN WEEK PANDEMIC EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION EXTENSION. ANOTHER QUESTION WAS POSED BY COMMITTEE MEMBER WHICH WAS HOW MUCH HOW MANY HOW MUCH FUNDS HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM THE FED SO FAR AND WHAT IS THE REPAYMENT PLAN AND IMPACT ON BUSINESSES. AS OF JUNE TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA HAS ADVANCE A TOTAL OF FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT DUE TO SEVERAL LARGE EMPLOYER TAX RECEIPTS TOWARDS THE BEGINNING OF MAY APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FOUR BILLION HAS BEEN REPAID TODAY. LEAVING THE OUTSTANDING LOAN VALUE OF THE TWO POINT SIX BILLION I THINK THAT HITS ALL OF THE QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASK. ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. YOU'RE WELCOME SENATOR BREAUX FOLLOW BY SENATOR NIELSEN AND THEN YOU CAN ADAM TO RUSSIA THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CAN I HAVE SEE AUTHOR IF SHE WOULD JUST EXPAND ON THAT QUESTION- THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION WAS- HOW MUCH MONEY IS OUTSTANDING ON THE LOAN BALANCE WHICH YOU ARTICULATED VERY WELL FOR BILLION DOLLARS ONE POINT FOUR BILLION REPEAT TWO POINT SIX BILLION BUT WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON THE TWO POINT SIX BILLION FOR EMPLOYERS IN THE FUTURE THAT WAS A SET HALF OF THAT QUESTION HOW IT'S GONNA BE. A MINUTE PLEASE THANK YOU. WOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THAT QUESTION YES. ABSENT CHANGES TO THE STATE'S FINANCING STRUCTURE FOR YOU I IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT ANY OUTSTANDING BALANCE WILL BE REPAID THE A FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX RECEIPTS SIMILAR TO WHAT OCCURRED DURING THE INSOLVENCY PERIOD FOLLOWING THE GREAT RECESSION THE FULL F. U. T. A TAX RATE IS 6% ON THE FIRST SEVEN THOUSAND AND EARNINGS PER EMPLOYEE. PAID ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND COLLECTED BY THE IRS HOWEVER EMPLOYERS RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT TAX CREDIT A FIVE POINT 4% WHICH LOWERED THEIR FEDERAL TAX LIABILITY TO JUST POINT 6% ON THE FIRST SEVEN THOUSAND OR FORTY TWO DOLLARS PER EMPLOYEE. CALIFORNIAN PLAYERS EXPERIENCE THEY POINT 3% LOSS EACH YEAR ON THE F. U. T. TAX CREDIT FROM TAX YEARS TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOLLOWING THE GREAT RECESSION PICKING OUT A TWO POINT 1% TAX CREDIT REDUCTION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OR ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS PER EMPLOYEE IT'S ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS WILL PROBABLY EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE YEARS OF F. UT A TAX CREDIT REDUCTIONS. BEGINNING WITH TAX YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. TERRY APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. COLLEAGUES I REALIZE THAT WE HAD A SUPPORT ON THIS BILL- PENDING THAT QUESTION BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT QUESTION WAS ANSWERED WHICH I ANTICIPATED- AGAIN WE HAD A SUPPORT ON THIS BILL BUT BASED ON THE WAY THE QUESTION WAS ANSWERED. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BORROWED AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND- FOR THE- UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND WHICH IS 1100% FUNDED. BY EMPLOYERS BASED ON THE FOR SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT EACH EMPLOYEE MAKES. THAT LONE THAT AS NOT REPEAT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRED EMPLOYERS NOT TO GET A FOODIE TAX REDUCTION CREDIT. THE TIMES- BECAUSE WE ARE A STATE THAT HAS TO PAY STATE UNEMPLOYMENT TAX AND FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX VERY FEW STATES. HAVE TO PAY BOTH A TAXES. SO CALIFORNIA'S ALLOWED OF FOOD A TAX REDUCTION CREDIT FROM THE FEDERAL SIDE. THIS PARTICULAR BORROWING OR THIS MANY THAT IS OWED NOW AT NO FAULT OF THE EMPLOYER. THIS WAS A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OF COVE IT THIS REQUIRED FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION POSSIBLY MORE CALIFORNIANS TO LOSE THEIR JOB. AND NOW EMPLOYERS WILL BE PAYING THIS ADDITIONAL- PAY BACK THE LOAN. THAT WAS IT MINISTERED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THIS SET DOWN. YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT EMPLOYERS RESPONSIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND WE LAY SOMEBODY OFF OR WE HAVE TO TERMINATE SOMEBODY. THERE'S ALWAYS THE ISSUE OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT EMPLOYEE GETS- THE PROPER YOU I DIDN'T FIT. BUT THIS AGAIN WAS AT NO FAULT THE EMPLOYERS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUSINESSES ARE BARELY SURVIVING DISCO WITH THE TUITION AND TO HIT THEM WITH THE IMPACT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE THE FOOD TAX REDUCTION CREDIT IN PAIN BACK. TO GOVERNMENT. IN SOME CASES THIS TOTALS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS- PER YEAR. AND I KNOW THAT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE- FOR THREE YEARS DURING THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT I SIX. MIGHT MOM BUSINESS AT THE BORROW MONEY TO PAY THAT LOW. BACK AND THEN. USE THE PROP WE GET EVERY. TO PAY BACK LONG. AND IT'S JUST RIGHT. WE OR THE SMALL OWNER AND BUSINESS OWNERS IN GENERAL IS. CAL WILL BE SUBJECT TO PAY BACK THAT LOAN THAT WAS CREATED. BY THE UNEMPLOYMENT- INSURANCE THAT WAS PAID OUT TO EMPLOYEES BUT ONLY BASED ON THE COLBERT SHUT DOWN. SO I APPRECIATE- THE BUDGET CHAIR WOMAN'S- ANSWER IN THAT. I REALIZE IT HAS A SUPPORT TO RECOMMENDATION ON IT FROM THE OUR SITE PENDING THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. AND BECAUSE EMPLOYERS ARE GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NO. A FAULT AT CREATING THIS AND EMPLOYMENT CATASTROPHE I WOULD ASK THAT YOU NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL LET'S COME UP WITH A BETTER SOLUTION- SO THAT- EMPLOYERS AREN'T HIT WITH THIS DRASTIC COST WHILE THEY'RE TRYING TO REBUILD. OUR ECONOMY TO MAKE UP THE FORTIES- ARE FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS BUDGET BUDGET DEFICIT. AS I SAID AND A COUPLE OF. WEEKS AGO OR LAST WEEK. WE HAVE TO RELY ON THE IT SECTOR TO PROVIDE JOBS. TO PROVIDE DOT. SIX REVENUE. SPENT IN THE BUILDING KANSEN PERSON INCOME TAX. AND SO THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE THAT. BARELY SURVIVING THE CODE SITUACIóN THINK ABOUT YOUR SMALL RESTAURANT. THE BARELY SURVIVED ON CURBSIDE TO GO THAT IS BARELY- MAKING IT OR IS NOT RE OPENING THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS PAID OUT BECAUSE OF COVERT NINETEEN. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE IMPACT ON AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO MEET THIS- LOAN REQUIREMENTS. THE CALIFORNIA IS NOT GOING TO PAY BACK- THEY'RE GONNA LEAVE IT ON THE BACKS OF THE- JOB CREATORS IN OUR STATE AND I WOULD AB RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I'D GREATLY APPRECIATE THE- THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS BEING DISTRIBUTED THROUGH UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL I THINK IT'S TREMENDOUS- ARE AGENCIES NEVER SAW THIS COMING SO I KNOW THAT THE PRESSURE IS TREMENDOUS. HOWEVER I THINK AS A BODY WE SHOULD COMMUNICATE TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE THESE MONIES TO THE UNEMPLOYED IN A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WAY. THAN WHAT'S BEING DONE NOW- I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN VERY PATIENT. ABOUT HOW OF THE PACE WITH WHICH THIS IS BEING DONE. BUT I MUST SAY I SAID THIS YESTERDAY IN THE COMMITTEE. THAT THE PRESSURE THAT- I KNOW JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OUR STAFF IS GOING THROUGH EVERY SINGLE DAY. HEARING THE ANGER THE FRUSTRATION- THE PASSION WITH WHICH THE CALLS ARE COMING IN. IS SOMETHING THAT EIGHT YOU KNOW IS BECOMING VERY UNBEARABLE SO I KNOW THE PRESSURE IS ON THE AGENCIES BUT MORE HAS TO BE DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT HAS TO BE DONE BECAUSE WE'RE SO MANY MONTHS AFTER THIS- AFTER THEY ALL STARTED LOSING THEIR JOB SO THAT'S MY ONLY COMMENT OF ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE DO SOMETHING. REALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW THANK YOU. SENATOR MORLOCK THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT FOR YEAH I HAD A LONG DISCUSSION ON THIS LAST NIGHT AT THE BUDGET IS TO REVIEW COMMITTEE AND- GOING BACK TO MY EARLY CAREER I DID PREPARE A LOT OF PAYROLL TAX RETURNS- THERE ARE TWO- UNEMPLOYMENT TAX. CATEGORIES SAID EMPLOYERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE IS STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THE OTHERS VIEW THE- AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE WAS ACCURATE AND HOW CUTE IS CALCULATED TO FORTY TWO DOLLARS PER EMPLOYEE. IF THEY ARE AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE YEAR. WE WERE INSTRUCTED LAST NIGHT. THAT THE S. YOU WHY THE STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WOULD THE RATES WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED BECAUSE- THE LAYOFFS WERE DUE TO CO OF IT AND NOT. BECAUSE OF OTHER. CIRCUMSTANCES SO EMPLOYERS WOULD. NOT BE PENALIZED AND TO- SHOULD THIS STATE. TAKE THE SAME ROAD. AS THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WHICH DID NOT PAY OFF THE FEUDAL LOANS RIGHT AWAY SO EMPLOYERS HAD TO PAY THE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN PER EMPLOYEE THAT WOULD NOT. TAKE AFFECT UNTIL TWO YEARS AFTER WE HAD ESTABLISHED A LOAN BALANCE THAT WAS ON PAID SO WE STILL HAVE SOME BREATHING ROOM HERE AND CORRECT ME IF I DIDN'T GET THAT IT CORRECTLY MADAM CHAIR BUT I THINK THAT I'M COMFORTABLE AND SUPPORTING THIS BILL TONIGHT. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU- SENATOR MORE LOCK. AND THE CENTER YOU MENTION THAT NEW CLOTHES SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THEIR PRESIDENT MEMBERS. I THINK OF CALLING FROM BAKERSFIELD CONFUSED THE ISSUE A LITTLE BIT AND I WANT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT I ASK OUR STAFF AND I WENT TO THE BUDGETARY WHO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KEEP TRACK OF ALL THE THINGS YOU KEEP TRACK OF WHICH DO AN EXCELLENT JOB. AND I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR THAT. IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THIS WILL BE PICKED UP BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE WILL NOT BE LIKE IT WAS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. FOR AND I WAS I'M AN EMPLOYER SAW THIS HAPPEN TO ME AS WELL AS IT DID. THE MEMBER FROM BAKERSFIELD THAT WE HAD TO PAY. LITERALLY UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE JUST FINISHED PAYING OFF. THE UNEMPLOYMENT DEBT. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BORROWED. AGAINST THE LITTLE LONG LONG TERM OF UNEMPLOYMENT THE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO CLASS SO. I BELIEVE UNDER THIS SCENARIO. IT WILL BE BACK FILLED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ONE OTHER ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO ADD. WHICH I TALK WHICH I ASKED THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LAST NIGHT WHICH IS VERY CRUCIAL TO BUSINESS OWNERS. WHO ARE TRYING TO HIRE THEIR EMPLOYEES. WHEN THEY'RE GETTING FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK NOT ONLY FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT SIX HUNDRED. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE'S REALLY NO REASON FOR THEM IN SOME CASES TO GO BACK TO WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING MORE MONEY- ON UNEMPLOYMENT THAN THEY WOULD BE. IF THEY WERE WORKING. IF YOU OFFER YOUR JOB BACK AS AN EMPLOYER. THEY'RE REQUIRED TO TAKE THAT JOB AND IF THEY DON'T. THEN THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE UNEMPLOYED. SKEWS ME UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WHICH IS CRUCIAL WE WANT TO GET THEM BACK TO WORK. OBVIOUSLY THEY MAY BE TAKING A PAY CUT BUT THAT'S TAX DOLLARS THAT ARE PAYING THAT UNEMPLOYMENT AND IT'S ALSO EMPLOYERS THAT ARE PAYING IT. SO I ENCOURAGE THOSE BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE TRYING TO GET BACK STARTED. TO GET IN AND IF THEY DON'T TAKE THEIR JOB BACK REPORT INTO THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BECAUSE IT'S ALL OF US THAT ARE PAYING- THOSE FEES. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE LEGISLATION I BELIEVE WE HAVE IT IRONED OUT RIGHT AND THIS IS CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA TO GET MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR GREAT JOB AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KEEP IT ALL STRAIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE AGAIN. YES MADAM PRESIDENT I AM I GUESS I MISUNDERSTOOD THE RESPONSE FROM THE CHAIR WOMAN THE BUDGET HERE- I UNDERSTOOD HER TO SAY THAT WOULD BE PAID BACK SIMILAR TO THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. A CRISIS THAT WE HAD THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING. AND I JUST GOT CORRECTED BY THE CONSULTANT THAT IT IS NOT THAT IS NOT THAT'S THE WAY I UNDERSTOOD IT I DON'T. THINK THAT SO I-APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. SO THE CONSULTING CORRECTING ME HAT IT IS NOT GOING TO BE DONE LIKE THAT THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE REPAYMENT FROM THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SIMILAR TO THAT.

ON JUNE FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SENATE BILL SEVENTY FOUR WHICH REPRESENTED THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET AGREEMENT THIS BILL MAKES AMENDMENTS BASED OFF OF SB SEVENTY FOUR. THAT REPRESENT THE BUDGET AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. SOME OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR INCLUDE.

INSTEAD THIS AGREEMENT RELIES UPON UPDATED BASELINE FORECAST ADJUSTMENTS TO REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND AN INCREASE PROP NINETY EIGHT DEFERRAL.

MEMBERS THIS BILL REPRESENTS A THOUGHTFUL AND RESPONSIBLE BUDGET AGREEMENT. AND I'M ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL DEBATER DISCUSSIONS SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE. THE PROJECT WE ARE BUDGET CHAIR WHO ARE SO HIGHLY RESPECT. THIS IS WHERE I WILL. INDICATE BY A NO VOTE MY OWN FRUSTRATION. WITH THE YEAR THE PROCESS THE PRODUCT. THIS WAS A BUDGET THAT STARTED OUT WITH GREAT HOPE. I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH SOME ELEMENTS AS I SPOKE THAT DAY WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS BUDGET OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PARTICULAR IS TOWED AWAY CHOSE TO DEAL AND SUCH A CONSTRUCTIVE AND PROBLEM SOLVING AND LONG TERM AWAY WITH HOMELESSNESS. WELL ALL OF OUR HOPES ALONG THE WAY OF KIND OF. WERE DERAILED. OF GREAT MAGNITUDE UNDERSTOOD. BUT THE DIFFICULTY THAT I'VE HAD AND I DO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE- SHORTENING UP OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. I'D BE MULLIN RIGHT. AND I DO ARGUE THAT IT'S DONE A DISSERVICE BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO IN DEPTH SCRUTINIZE THE BUDGET INPUT THE BUDGET AS WE NORMALLY COULD. AND THE SUBCOMMITTEES IS THE ONE PLACE FOR. THE MINORITY PARTY COULD HAVE SOME GOOD FAITH DISCUSSIONS NEGOTIATIONS AND RESOLUTIONS AND AGREEMENTS. AS I'VE SAID HERE BEFORE QUITE FRANKLY AND HAVING SAID ON SUBCOMMITTEES FOR MANY YEARS AS WE VOTE ITEM BY ITEM IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEES. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. THE MAJORITY IN THE MINORITY PARTY MEMBERS ARE IN AGREEMENT. THAT HAS ALWAYS FELT GOOD. THEY'RE ALWAYS FELT GOOD. IN YEARS PAST ONE. I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE BIG FIVE. NOW I HAVE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE FUNNY STORY ABOUT THAT THOUGH. WHEN I CAME HERE. I FIGURED THAT. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE AFFECTED YOU HAD TO GET ON. THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. THE END SO I GOT ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND I DIDN'T FEEL VERY EFFECTIVE. SO IN A BECAME A MEMBER OF THE BIG FIVE. AND THEN I THOUGHT BOY I'M REALLY GOING TO BE AFFECTED NOW. WELL I FOUND OUT IT WASN'T QUITE AS BIG A DEAL BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT WAS A- CONSTRUCT. UNDER GOVERNOR NATION AT THE TIME. OR BY THE BIG FIVE CONVENE ONLY ON THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES. NOT AS ONE YEAR WE HAD THE WHOLE BUDGET DONE. THEN THE BIG FIVE BUT THEN FINALLY HAD TO CONCLUDE. AT THE END WHEN ASKED WHAT WORD IS A BUDGET FINALLY GET DONE. I SAID WELL IT'S A MATTER OF FATIGUE. WHEN NOBODY GETS TIRED ENOUGH. NOW THAT'S KIND OF A FACETIOUS WAY TO PUT IT. BUT SOMETIMES THE EXHAUSTION WEARS YOU DOWN. WHEN YOU REACH A DEAL. SO THIS YEAR FOR SPOKE WELL AND EVEN LAST YEAR TO IT'S SORT OF BECOME A PARTY OF THE BIG THREE. AND MINORITY PARTY. I STILL FELT LAST YEAR THAT I HAD PLENTY OF SAY THE INPUT AT LEAST AN OPPORTUNITY EXPRESS MYSELF THIS YEAR. ALMOST NONE. WHERE WE YOU'D NORMALLY SPENT MUCH. MANY WEEKS IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEE SHOULD LABORIOUS WORK EVERY THURSDAY AFTERNOON THREE FOUR HOURS. AND THEN WE'D HAVE A LABORIOUS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. EXHAUSTING BUT FRUITFUL AND PRODUCTIVE AND A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. TO NEGOTIATE. AND GIVE A LITTLE SMILE THAT'S ONE OF MY DEAREST MOMENTS. ONE NIGHT AND THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THEN SHARED. BY GOOD FRIEND SENATOR MARK LENO SAN FRANCISCO. I A. B. E. OFFERED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL NEITHER THE GOOD TO DEVOTE QUE TO THEIR ARTS COUNCIL IN. SO I WROTE ASK FOR TWO MILLION MORE. INSTEAD OF FIVE I WAS GOING TO GO SEVEN. ANY SAID AND LAUGHED OUT LOUD HE SAID YES ONLY TIME TO. JIM NIELSEN EVER OUTBID ME TO SPEND MONEY. WELL I'M PROUD TO SAY. TO HAVE SOME INPUT NOW THE SAYS CITY THIS YEAR WE DID NOT HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S. I FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT. AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I FOUND OF GREAT MERIT IN THE GOVERNOR'S ORIGINAL BUDGET. FELL BY THE WAYSIDE TOO AND I GUESS I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY. AND INDEED THESE ARE HARD TIMES. BUT I WANT TO COMPLIMENT ALL OF US IN PARTICULAR THOSE OF YOU WHO SERVED IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND LABORED THROUGH THIS TRENCH. I WILL BE A NOBLE AND ASK FOR A NO VOTE. BUT MAYBE I COULD CHARACTERIZE IT AS A SOFT NOBLE. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I TO- WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN. THESE ARE IN PERFECT TIMES OF THIS IS NAMED PERFECT BUDGET PROCESS AND WE'RE DOING OUR BEST EVEN WHEN WE HAVE STRONG PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS BUT I WOULD THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS TRULY BIPARTISAN. AND ULTIMATELY BICAMERAL IS ALL OF US APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE HIGHER EDUCATION. AND I KNOW THAT WE WENT FROM- TWENTY TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS- YEAR AND A HALF AGO- IN NOW WE'RE DOWN TO FIFTY FOUR- BEFORE THE BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS BUT ONE THING THAT I'M REALLY HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RE VISIT. OUR THE CUTS TO SEE ISSUE UC AND CSU IN PARTICULAR. I THINK THESE INSTITUTIONS. PART TAKING SUCH ADDRESS DRAMATIC HIT BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THE FULL COST OF GOING REMOTE THEY DON'T KNOW THE FULL ATTRITION RATE OF STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT RETURN IN RE MATRICULATED ARE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INDEBTEDNESS- IN THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE SCHOOLS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AT SOME POINT WHETHER BE A TRAILER- IN IN- THE COMING MONTHS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT FINDING WAYS BECAUSE- WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE FEDS COME IN. AND ALLOW US DOLLARS THAT WOULD TO OFFSET THESE LOSSES OR THESE REDUCTIONS IN THE BUDGET. BUT LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY DON'T HAPPEN. I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT AS WE APPRECIATE HIGHER EDUCATION AS ONE THE GREAT ECONOMIC ENGINES. OF OUR STATE. CREATING ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR VERTICAL ADVANCEMENT FOR MINORITY PARTIES ASSUME ON MINORITIES AND- IN THOSE THAT WE TALK ABOUT AS BEING DISENFRANCHISED I THINK THIS NEEDS TO REMAIN TOP OF MIND. MOVING FORWARD IF WE DO NOT GET FEDERAL FUNDING I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THAT WE RE VISIT THE BUDGET TO SEE ISSUE SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY ARE. GOING TO BE IN DESPERATE NEED. THANK YOU SENATOR BORCHERS BUT VETERAN PRO TâM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES THIS IS CERTAINLY BEEN A LONG DAY- BUT IT'S ALSO BEEN A TREMENDOUSLY STRESSFUL AND UNPRECEDENTED AND TRULY UNIQUE YEAR WE KNOW THAT BUT WE ARE PERSEVERING DESPITE THE IMMENSE CHALLENGES ACCOMPLISHING OUR WORK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA. WE PRESERVED- WE PERSEVERED AND PROTECTING ALL THOSE WHO LIVE HERE THROUGH OUR SWIFT ACTIONS TO INCREASE SUPPLIES AND FUN LIFESAVING CARE AN ACTING PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT PERSEVERANCE CONTINUES THROUGH TODAY AND FOR TONIGHT AS WE VOTE ON THIS BUDGET. WHICH BALANCES THE BUDGET WHILE ALSO UPHOLDING OUR COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WE STARTED TWENTY TWENTY AT AN ECONOMIC HIGH. AND PIVOTED SWIFTLY OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO ARRIVE AT A BUDGET PLAN. THAT IS RESPONSIBLE. AND IS RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT WAS NOT A SIMPLE TASK IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY TO BALANCE ALL OF THOSE ISSUES AS EVIDENCED BY THE CONVERSATION HERE TODAY. THIS BUDGET REFLECTS COMPROMISE ON ALL SIDES WE HAD TO GIVE UP SOME OF OUR PRIORITIES. JUST THE STATE EMPLOYEES ARE GIVING UP PAY INCREASES. WE'VE HAD TO EXERT RESTRAINT AND REDUCTIONS IN SPENDING. THAT WE DON'T FEEL GREAT ABOUT. AND THERE IS MORE BUDGET WORK THAT LIES AHEAD WE KNOW THAT. BUT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ARRIVE AT AN AGREEMENT THAT IS PRAGMATIC AND BALANCED THANKS IN LARGE PART NOT TO DECISIONS WE ARE MAKING RIGHT NOW. BUT THE RESPONSIBLE BUDGET DID BUDGETING DECISIONS THAT WE'VE MADE OVER THE PAST DECADE AND MANY OF US HAVE BEEN HERE. FOR THAT ENTIRE DECADE WHEN WE HAD TO FIGHT OUR WAY BACK. FROM A TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT AND BEFORE THAT A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE THAT HAD TO ADDRESS A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. BECAUSE OF OUR RESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO BUILDING RESERVES AND PAYING DOWN DEBTS IN GOOD TIMES. WERE ABLE TO PASS THIS BUDGET TODAY THE DOES NOT SLASH SCHOOL AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. WE SHOULD APPLAUD OURSELVES FOR BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. IN ADDITION TO PROTECTING EDUCATION AND PROGRAMS WE ARE MAINTAINING SIGNIFICANT RESERVES AND OTHER SOLUTION TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX TO ASSIST THE STATE IN MAKING IT THROUGH THE EXPECTED BUDGET CHALLENGES OF THE COMING MONTHS AND THE UPCOMING YEARS. WE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE LUXURY OF VOTING ON WHAT WE ARE TODAY DURING THAT LAST RECESSION. WE WOULDN'T OF HAD THE LUXURY. THE FACT THAT WE COULD BALANCE THIS BUDGET WHILE MAINTAINING SIGNIFICANT RESERVES IS SIGNIFICANT. AND WE DID SO WITHOUT HAVING TO USE COST DEFERRALS LIKE WE DID DURING THE PAST RECESSION UNDER OTHER GOVERNORS INCLUDING. REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS BUDGET PROCESS OVER NINE HOURS YESTERDAY AFTER. AFTER OTHER WORK ON THIS FLOOR OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBERS MET. IT WAS A PROCESS AIDED BY THE COLLABORATION OF EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM. SPEAKER RENDON AND OUR PARTNERS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND GOVERNOR NEWSOME IN HIS TEAM. I HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU TO OUR BUDGET CHAIR AND OUR VICE CHAIR SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR NIELSEN OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET STAFF. THE LEGISLATIVE DATA CENTER WHO IN MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO THIS WORK. INCLUDING A ALSO THE ENTIRE BUDGET STAFF OUR STAFFS. AND LET ME JUST ALSO AT THE DEAD TO WORK FOR FATHER'S DAY TO DELIVER THIS AGREEMENT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK. I WANT TO THANK YOU TO ALL THE DEPUTIES THAT LEDGE COUNCIL FURTHER SUPPORTED DRAFTING OR LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE. SO MANY PEOPLE HAD TO BE PART OF MAKING IT POSSBLE FOR US TO DO THIS WORK. EVERYONE HAS BEEN WORKING HARD AND FAST TO DELIVER A BALANCED BUDGET UNDER INTENSE CRISIS CONDITIONS. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU TO THOSE WHO FOR YEARS AGREED TO BUDGETS THAT MAY HAVE NOT GONE AS FAR AS WE WOULD HAVE LIKED. DUE TO OUR COMMITMENT TO BUILD THOSE RESERVES AND PAY DOWN THOSE DEBTS. THAT DISCIPLINE HELPED US CRAFT THIS BUDGET WITHOUT OPPRESSIVE CUTS. WHEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAPPENS AND IT WILL WE MUST REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT IT HAS BEEN TO HAVE RESERVES AVAILABLE FOR THIS VERY MOMENT. COLLEAGUES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COLLABORATION IN YOUR WORK IN THIS UNPRECEDENTED HERE. AND WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK.

THAT IT WILL BE WITHIN OUR CONTROL HOW QUICKLY WE ARE ABLE TO GET THAT WORK DONE AND STILL MEET THE INTENT OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITH OUR LEGISLATION AND SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR- CONSTITUENTS SO I WOULD IMPLORE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT TONIGHT. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE TO BE HOME IN THEIR DISTRICTS TO DO OTHER WORK RELATED THINGS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS SO MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE WORK PRESIDING TODAY. WE WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING FRIDAY JUNE TWENTY SIXTH AT NINE AM THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM COLLEAGUES WE ARE IN RECESS UNTIL NINE AM TOMORROW MORNING.
