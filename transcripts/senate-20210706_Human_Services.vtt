00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.789
BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:11.990
THE MAJOR CHANGE IN OUR CHILD

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.859
CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. I AM

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:15.494
ENCOURAGED THAT THIS IS JUST

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.995
ONE PIECE OF LARGER EFFORTS TO

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.764
REFORM THE CHILD CARE DELIVERY

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.932
SYSTEM INCLUDING CHANGES IN

MOVING PARTS HERE ALL WHILE THE

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:28.874
CHILD CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.642
RECOVERING FROM THE IMPACTS OF

00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:32.744
COVE IN NINETEEN. I WANT TO

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:33.545
STRESS THAT WE NEED TO PROCEED

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:35.280
WITH CAUTION AND MONITOR THE

00:23:35.347 --> 00:23:38.250

COMMUNITY WHO ARE WORRIED THAT-

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.312
BASICALLY AT LEAST BASED ON

00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:09.881
ANALYSIS THAT THIS WOULD.

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:12.284
BASICALLY REMOVE- THE CHILDREN

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.286
WHO ARE FOR AN OLDER FROM CHILD

00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:15.921
CARE BUT YET I ALSO NOTED THAT

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:18.023

EDUCATION FOR THE ASSEMBLY. CAN

00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:35.874
YOU HELP US PUT US INTO THIS

00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:36.808
THE LARGER CONTEXT OF THE

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:38.643
BUDGET WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR ECA

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.979
OVERALL- AND HOW THIS FITS INTO

00:24:41.046 --> 00:24:42.848
THIS LARGER. IT IS THIS LARGER

00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:45.483
CONTEXT. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.152
I THINK OUR CHAIR KIND OF SAID

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:48.954
IT WELL THAT THIS IS A PIECE OF

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.356
THE LARGER PUZZLE. AND IF THIS

00:24:51.423 --> 00:24:53.225
WAS THE ONLY PIECE IT WOULD BE

00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:54.659
PROBLEMATIC IT'S ALWAYS BEENA

00:24:54.726 --> 00:24:55.894
QUEST TO ME AND OTHER

00:24:55.961 --> 00:24:56.995
SUPPORTERS HAVE UNIVERSAL

00:24:57.062 --> 00:24:58.930
ACCESS FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS. BUT

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:01.132
IF WE WERE DOING THIS WITHOUT

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:02.868
INCREASING RATES AND FOCUSING

00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:05.637
ON ON SLOTS. AND EXPANDING

00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:07.606
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROVIDERS TO

00:25:07.672 --> 00:25:10.075
SERVE ZERO THREE THREE WITH THE

00:25:10.141 --> 00:25:11.376
INCREASE RATE STRUCTURE AND

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:13.511
MORE SLOTS. THAT WOULD NOT WORK

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:15.180
TOGETHER BUT- IT THE BUT YOU'RE

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:16.281
RIGHT IF THE IF THERE'S A

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:17.616
FAMILY THAT THAT LIKE THE

00:25:17.682 --> 00:25:18.617
WITNESS SAID EARLIER THE

00:25:18.683 --> 00:25:20.652
OPPOSITION THEY LIKE THIS. I

00:25:20.719 --> 00:25:23.889
THINK THE SAID- A BI LINGUAL-

00:25:23.955 --> 00:25:27.626
PROGRAM THAT FITS THEIR NEEDS

00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:28.193
AND IF THEIR INCOME ELIGIBLE

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.060
FAMILY. YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:30.462
THAT FAMILIES FOR SO THEY'RE

00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:32.464
GONNA BE GOING ON TO CANDOR AND

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.698
FIRST BY TIMES BILLS

00:25:33.765 --> 00:25:35.333
IMPLEMENTED. BUT IF THERE IS A

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.534
TWO YEAR OLD THE WORLD TODAY

00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:37.769
THAT WANTS TO GO TO THIS TYPE

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:38.837
OF PROGRAM. AND THEY'RE

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:40.472
ELIGIBLE THEY CAN CONTINUE

00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:41.940
CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE PUT IT

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:44.509
IN. OUR BILL THAT INCOME

00:25:44.576 --> 00:25:45.343
ELIGIBLE FAMILIES CAN CONTINUE

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.078
TO DO SO- WHAT THIS REALLY

00:25:47.145 --> 00:25:48.813
MEANS IS FAMILIES THAT TODAY

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.917
HAVE NO OPTIONS. THERE TO-

00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:53.985
BRIDGE TO GET FREE BECAUSE THEY

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:55.787
MAKE YOU KNOW SIXTY SEVEN

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:56.655
THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT IN OUR

00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:58.657
AREAS ACROSS THE STATE. THOSE

00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:00.492
FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING PAYING

00:26:00.558 --> 00:26:02.160
THE RENT IN THEIR BILLS AND-

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:03.528
THEY DON'T GET THE SUBSIDIZED

00:26:03.595 --> 00:26:05.096
PROGRAM THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE

00:26:05.163 --> 00:26:05.730
FREE SO THEY WOULD NOW GET AN

00:26:05.797 --> 00:26:11.036
OPTION. TO GO TO T. K. WE ALSO

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:13.438
HAVE- ANOTHER COMPANION BILL

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:15.006
THAT WAS HEARD. IN THIS

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:16.741
COMMITTEE A FEW. MONTHS AGO BY

00:26:16.808 --> 00:26:18.910
SEN EARLY MON SB FIFTY WHICH

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:20.545
WOULD SHIFT ALL THE MONEY THAT

00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:22.781
CURRENTLY GOES. TO SERVE FOUR

00:26:22.847 --> 00:26:23.982
YEAR OLDS AND STATE PRESCHOOL

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:25.884
AND GIVE THOSE TO PROVIDERS TO

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:27.852
SERVE MORRISON THREE ZERO THREE

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.054
THREE. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.622
THAT MEANS FOR OUR LOWEST

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:34.092
INCOME. AND MOST VULNERABLE

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:34.693
THREE TWO AND THREE AND FOUR

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:36.294
YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA THEY

00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:37.896
WOULD GET TWO YEARS. OF TOP

00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:40.532
QUALITY FREE PRE K. IN

00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:42.834
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A ON WHICH

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:43.668
WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE MAKER

00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:45.103
WHICH WOULD. ADDRESS THE

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.705
ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND THEN

00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:47.839
LASTLY I THINK THE ELEPHANT IN

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:49.541
THE ROOM IS WE'RE STILL

00:26:49.607 --> 00:26:51.109
STRUGGLING TO FINALIZE THE

00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:53.044
STATE BUDGET. I THINK THERE ARE

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:54.813
LIKE LITERALLY THREE ISSUES

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:56.348
THAT WERE STILL. NEGOTIATING

00:26:56.414 --> 00:26:57.749
THE SPEAKER AND THE PRO TEM

00:26:57.816 --> 00:26:59.517
ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR. AND I

00:26:59.584 --> 00:27:01.619
THINK THE TOP ONE IS THIS ISSUE

00:27:01.686 --> 00:27:03.922
OPERATE REFORM. SO WE DID PUT

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:06.491
MONEY IN THE BUDGET. TWO WEEKS

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:08.093
AGO ON MONDAY BOTH HOUSES. OUR

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:10.562
LAST MONDAY I GUESS IT WAS. ON

00:27:10.628 --> 00:27:12.497
TO FIND GREAT REFORM. BUT WE

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:13.832
HAVE TO HAVE A COMPANION BILL

00:27:13.898 --> 00:27:15.133
EITHER A TRAILER BILL OR CENTER

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.202
LAID HIS BILL. TO SET THOSE

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:19.004
PIECES INACTION IN MOTION TO

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.872
MAKE TO MAKE TWO TO AUTHORIZE

00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:23.808
IT. SO IN IN TILL WE GET THAT

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:29.447
DONE I THINK THE CHILD CARE.

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:30.015
RULES I K. DON'T TELL ME SHE

00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:30.582
CHAU THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO

00:27:30.648 --> 00:27:32.884
ALL THESE OTHER. RIGHT SO- AND

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:33.918
I WOULD SAY IS WE'RE WE'RE

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:35.020
GONNA WRAP THE BUDGET UP SOON

00:27:35.086 --> 00:27:36.621
AND THIS IS A PRIORITY OF OUR-

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:37.522
LEADERS IN EACH HOUSE SAYING

00:27:37.589 --> 00:27:38.790
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN

00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:39.758
OUR BUDGET PROCESS UNTIL THIS

00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:41.693
ISSUE IS DONE. SO YOU KNOW THIS

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.495

MORE CLARITY. AND THAT THIS

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:51.436
WHOLE- PACKAGE I THINK WILL

SO I'M- I'M COMMITTED AND WE

00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:12.257

INTO- TKA INTO SCHOOL SETTINGS

00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:50.421
INTO FACILITIES THAT ARE REALLY

00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:52.423
NOT OUTFITTED ARE DESIGNED TO

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.391
ACCOMMODATE THESE LITTLE FOUR

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:55.426
YEAR OLDS. I'M IS ALSO A REAL

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:57.462
ISSUE. YOU KNOW YOUNG BABIES

00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:58.329
WHO ARE FOR THEY DON'T PEE ON

00:29:58.396 --> 00:29:59.330
COMMAND THEY NEED TO HAVE

00:29:59.397 --> 00:30:00.732
BATHROOMS IN THE CLASSROOMS

00:30:00.798 --> 00:30:02.100
THERE ARE A LOT OF SORT OF YOU

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:04.669
KNOW- THE SETTINGS HAVE TO BE

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:07.539
DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE. YOU

00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:08.106
KNOW THESE LITTLE PEOPLE WHO

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:11.276
ARE. TRANSITIONING THEMSELVES-

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:12.076
AND ARE USED TO DIFFERENT KINDS

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:14.412
OF SETTINGS. AND YOU KNOW FOR

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:15.647
MANY AND THIS ISN'T IN YOUR

00:30:15.713 --> 00:30:17.182
BILL BUT FOR MANY CHILD CARE

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:19.784
PROVIDERS WHO- WERE ON THE

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:21.419
FRONT LINES DURING THE PANDEMIC

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.820
AND TAKING CARE OF OUR

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:24.923
ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO WORK IN.

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:27.525
THESE FAMILY CHILD CARE

00:30:27.592 --> 00:30:29.827
SETTINGS. YOU KNOW FOR US TO

00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:30.895
MOVE FORWARD ON SO MANY OTHER

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:32.397
THINGS AND NOT RATE REFORM IS A

00:30:32.463 --> 00:30:34.432
SLAP IN THE FACE TO THEM. YOU

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:36.834
KNOW IT AND THEY CONTINUE TO BE

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:39.837
PUT. ON TO THE BACK OF THE BUS

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:41.206
AND THE OTHER REALITY IS WHICH

00:30:41.272 --> 00:30:42.574
YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.608
THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:44.709
CREATE A SYSTEM THAT SIPHONS

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:46.277
OFF THE FOUR YEAR OLD YOU KNOW

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:48.880
AND LEAVES THE HIGHEST COST.

00:30:48.947 --> 00:30:51.716
BABIES ZERO TO THREE- IN THE

00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:55.053
NEWS- FCC EIGHT SETTINGS

00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:56.454
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:57.789
INCREDIBLE I MEAN THEY'RE VERY

00:30:57.855 --> 00:31:00.825
EXPENSIVE- AND THAT CAN BE A

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:04.162
REASON WHY. YOU KNOW DOORS ARE

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:06.030
FACED ARE ARE FORCED TO CLOSE.

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:07.865
I DON'T DEAL WITH DEPRIVE ITS-

00:31:07.932 --> 00:31:09.234
THAT'S NOT CRYSTAL STAIRS

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.535
WASN'T A PRIVATE WE WERE

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:12.203
DEALING WITH SUB CITY FAMILIES

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.807
ALL THE TIME- ARM. AND FOR

00:31:15.873 --> 00:31:17.242
RENTAL CHOICE DOESN'T REALLY

00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:19.477
BECOME PARENTAL CHOICE WHEN THE

00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:22.413
OPTION THAT IS FREE WHEN ALL OF

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.514
THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE

00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:26.451
ARE NOT DO NOT COST THE SAME.

00:31:26.517 --> 00:31:28.553
WHEN YOU HAVE ONE SYSTEMAX FREE

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.222
IT DOES KIND OF MANIPULATE WHAT

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:33.524
TRUE PARENTAL CHOICE IS. YOU

00:31:33.591 --> 00:31:36.894
KNOW HAVING SAID ALL THAT- YOU

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:38.396
KNOW I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:39.530
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:41.232
STEPPING UP TO TAKE CARE OF OUR

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:44.736
LITTLE PEOPLE- AND THIS IS A

00:31:44.802 --> 00:31:48.439
PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE. BUT THOSE

00:31:48.506 --> 00:31:50.775
FAMILIES ALSO. CAN'T REALLY

00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:52.477
DEAL WITH PART DAY CARE YOU

00:31:52.543 --> 00:31:53.645
KNOW THE PART DAY CARES FOR

00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:56.014
FOLKS WHO ARE WEALTHY- WHO HAVE

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.116
SOMEONE WHO AT IN YOU KNOW IN

00:31:58.182 --> 00:31:59.517
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY CAN DROP

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:00.718
EVERYTHING I DON'T HAVE

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:01.586
ANYTHING TO DO WE CAN PICK UP

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:03.154
THE BABY. AND TAKE THEM HOME

00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:04.722
AND CARE FOR THEM AND THOSE ARE

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:06.624
THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN SOUTH LA.

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:08.293
AND SO I HOPE THAT THESE THINGS

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:10.228
CAN MOVE TOGETHER SO AT THE END

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:11.629
OF THE DAY WE HAVE A PUZZLE

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:12.930
WITH ALL OF THE PIECES THAT ARE

00:32:12.997 --> 00:32:14.799
CONNECTED. THAT PROVIDE A

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:19.370
HOLISTIC- MENU OF CHOICES FOR

00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:21.806
PARENTS OF ALL ECONOMIC

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:23.841
BACKGROUNDS WHO ARE ABLE TO

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:26.411
MAKE THE BEST DECISION POSSIBLE

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:29.213
FOR THEIR LITTLE PEOPLE- AND

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.648
YOU KNOW I TOLD YOU THIS I

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:31.416
DON'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE

00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:32.984
BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR SCHOOL

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:36.054
DISTRICTS HAVE TO STEP UP- AND

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.356
THEY- WE SAW THAT THEY- WERE

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:39.357
NOT DOING WHAT THEY NEEDED TO

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:41.192
DURING THE PANDEMIC AS IT

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.828
RELATES TO EDUCATING- OUR YOUNG

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:44.896
FOLKS. YOU KNOW WHO WERE SCHOOL

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:47.398
AGE KIDS AND SO I WOULD REALLY

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:49.100
BE CHALLENGED TO OPEN UP A

00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:50.635
SCENARIO WHERE WERE FUNNELING

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:52.503
OUR LITTLE BABIES INTO THE

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.239
SAME. INTO THE SAME SYSTEM SO

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:57.041
I'M HOPING THAT THIS IS PART OF

00:32:57.108 --> 00:32:58.876
SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER AND MUCH

00:32:58.943 --> 00:33:00.511
MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAT

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:02.413
INCLUDES RIGHT REFORM BECAUSE

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.583
IF IT DOESN'T. THEN YOU KNOW WE

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.118
HAVE WE HAVE NOT HELPED THE

00:33:07.185 --> 00:33:09.987
PEOPLE WHO WE CONTINUE TO LEAN

00:33:10.054 --> 00:33:15.460
ON. I MEAN. THANK YOU WE HAVE

00:33:15.526 --> 00:33:18.830

00:33:24.268 --> 00:33:25.837
ISSUES I THINK AND APPRECIATES

00:33:25.903 --> 00:33:27.505
SIR KAMAGRA BRING IT UP AND

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:28.506

WITH BEFORE WHEN I WAS IN- I

00:33:30.274 --> 00:33:32.076
THINK BUDGETS OF THREE. IS THAT

00:33:32.143 --> 00:33:33.745
IT IS WERE YOU KNOW STANDING

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:36.114
YOUNGER CHILDREN GO INTO

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.415
POTENTIALLY GOING INTO TJ

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:38.616
MENDOZA DEBATE ABOUT THE

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:40.251

SELF- SO AGAIN I THINK AS WE'RE

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:47.125
LOOKING AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:49.360
PROVIDING TKA TO HELP KIDS WHO

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:51.796

THAT BOTH FACILITIES AND ALSO

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:58.035
THE STAFFING IS APPROPRIATE SO-

00:33:58.102 --> 00:33:59.904

PUTTING KIDS INTO A CLASSROOM

00:34:09.113 --> 00:34:10.915
RIGHT IT'S ABOUT FOCUSING ON OR

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:12.116

DIFFERENT THAN THE OLDER KIDS

THESE IDEAS ARE ARE IN PLAY- A

03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:41.076
FEW THINGS THAT- COUNTIES OF

03:03:41.143 --> 03:03:43.412
RAISES- A SITUATION THAT

03:03:43.479 --> 03:03:44.413

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND

03:03:45.681 --> 03:03:46.749
WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS WHAT

03:03:46.815 --> 03:03:48.717
THIS BILL CALLS FOR. IS FOR

03:03:48.784 --> 03:03:50.953
EVERY CITY COUNTY REGION AND

03:03:51.019 --> 03:03:53.489
STATE AGENCY TO DO AN ANALYSIS

03:03:53.555 --> 03:03:54.957
OF GAPS IN NEEDS ANALYSIS OF

03:03:55.023 --> 03:03:56.992
WHAT IS THE NEED. HOW MUCH

03:03:57.059 --> 03:03:58.460

03:03:58.527 --> 03:03:59.595
NEED WHAT'S THE GAP BETWEEN

THAT SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW

03:04:01.296 --> 03:04:02.297
ALL THE DIFFERENT PLAYERS ALL

03:04:02.364 --> 03:04:04.032
FIT TOGETHER AND WORK ASKING

03:04:04.099 --> 03:04:05.501
ALL THESE PLAYERS. TO WORK

03:04:05.567 --> 03:04:07.503
TOGETHER SO FOR EXAMPLE MANY

03:04:07.569 --> 03:04:08.070
FOR COUNTIES HAVE EMBEDDED

03:04:08.137 --> 03:04:10.773
CITIES. CITIES SAY THE COUNTIES

03:04:10.839 --> 03:04:12.574
OUGHT TO DO ONE ASPECT OF IT

03:04:12.641 --> 03:04:13.208
THE COUNTY SAY CITIES OUT TO DO

03:04:13.275 --> 03:04:14.710
AN ASPECT OF IT PART OF WHAT

03:04:14.777 --> 03:04:16.011
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST GET

03:04:16.078 --> 03:04:17.746
EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE WHAT.

03:04:17.813 --> 03:04:18.747
SKIN IN THE GAME ARE YOU

03:04:18.814 --> 03:04:19.648
PUTTING INTO THIS WHAT ARE YOU

03:04:19.715 --> 03:04:21.517
NOT SO THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE IN

03:04:21.583 --> 03:04:22.484
A VERY TRANSPARENT WAY WHAT'S

03:04:22.551 --> 03:04:24.686
GOING ON WE CAN'T. EXACTLY

03:04:24.753 --> 03:04:25.521
DEFINED ROLES AND

03:04:25.587 --> 03:04:26.822
RESPONSIBILITIES UNTIL WE DO

03:04:26.889 --> 03:04:28.023
THAT ANALYSIS SO PART OF THIS

03:04:28.090 --> 03:04:29.591
BILL SAYS LET'S DO THE ANALYSIS

03:04:29.658 --> 03:04:31.059
AND THEN LET'S PUT THE PLAN

03:04:31.126 --> 03:04:33.529
TOGETHER TO MOVE THAT FORWARD-

03:04:33.595 --> 03:04:34.897
ONE OTHER MAJOR ISSUE THAT HAS

03:04:34.963 --> 03:04:36.331
BEEN RAISED AS- THE INSPECTOR

03:04:36.398 --> 03:04:37.433
GENERAL AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING

03:04:37.499 --> 03:04:38.167
TO HOLD CITIES AND COUNTIES

03:04:38.233 --> 03:04:39.768
ACCOUNTABLE FOR AND I WANT TO

03:04:39.835 --> 03:04:41.270
MAKE IT VERY CLEAR BECAUSE-

03:04:41.336 --> 03:04:42.704

DON'T GIVE US ENOUGH MONEY WE

03:04:43.872 --> 03:04:45.407

03:04:45.474 --> 03:04:48.076
BILL SPECIFICALLY STATES. THAT

03:04:48.143 --> 03:04:49.445
JURISDICTION'S WILL ONLY BE

03:04:49.511 --> 03:04:50.879
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE

03:04:50.946 --> 03:04:52.848
RESOURCES THEY HAVE IF THEY

03:04:52.915 --> 03:04:54.016
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES WE

03:04:54.082 --> 03:04:55.083
UNDERSTAND THAT WE JUST WANNA

03:04:55.150 --> 03:04:56.385
MAKE SURE. THAT FOR SPENDING

03:04:56.452 --> 03:04:57.753
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE'RE

03:04:57.820 --> 03:04:58.921
GETTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

03:04:58.987 --> 03:05:01.023
VALUE FROM THAT SO. THOSE ARE

03:05:01.089 --> 03:05:02.057
SOME OF THE MAIN ISSUES THAT

03:05:02.124 --> 03:05:03.358
HAVE ARISEN BUT AS I'VE SAID

03:05:03.425 --> 03:05:04.626

HOMELESSNESS BUT NOT ANY

03:05:23.445 --> 03:05:24.713
HOMELESSNESS AND I THINK IT'S

03:05:24.780 --> 03:05:26.381
