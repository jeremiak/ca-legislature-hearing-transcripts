REALIZE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN.

00:51:13.938 --> 00:51:17.741 region:rollup2
A REASONS WHY IN THIS

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:20.611 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CASE THAT.

00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:22.079 region:rollup2
THERE'S A A NEED TO PROTECT.

00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:25.382 region:rollup2

BUT WE THINK THAT THE CURRENT

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:38.963 region:rollup2
RULES OF COURT PERMIT THAT TO

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:40.898 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AND TO THE EXTENT THAT.

00:51:38.963 --> 00:51:42.933 region:rollup2

ANY PARTY WHO ARE TO THE

00:51:48.439 --> 00:51:51.809 region:rollup2
PROCEEDING COULD RAISE THAT

00:51:49.807 --> 00:51:53.611 region:rollup2
OBJECTION AND THE COURT CAN DEAL

00:51:51.809 --> 00:51:54.712 region:rollup2
WITH IT IN THAT WAY.

00:51:53.611 --> 00:51:55.813 region:rollup2

WHICH I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH.

00:52:14.665 --> 00:52:17.267 region:rollup2

00:52:49.333 --> 00:52:51.168 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

00:52:49.867 --> 00:52:53.437 region:rollup2
DOT COM AT THAT WAS MADE

00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:54.838 region:rollup2
EARLIER THAT CREDIBILITY ISSUES

00:52:53.437 --> 00:52:56.507 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DISCUSSED IN OPEN

00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:57.408 region:rollup2
COURT WILL AGREE WITH THAT.

00:52:56.507 --> 00:52:58.876 region:rollup2
WHETHER SOMEBODY IS AN IMMIGRANT

00:52:57.408 --> 00:52:59.677 region:rollup2
OR NOT

00:52:58.876 --> 00:53:01.211 region:rollup2
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

00:52:59.677 --> 00:53:02.646 region:rollup2
CREDIBILITY.

00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:04.081 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT I THINK THAT'S

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:05.716 region:rollup2
WHERE WE MISS THE MARK I THINK

00:53:04.081 --> 00:53:06.750 region:rollup2
IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT.

00:53:05.716 --> 00:53:08.285 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.853 region:rollup2
RELEVANT THEIR GOING TO BE

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:11.689 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED IN OPEN COURT. BUT IF

00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:13.957 region:rollup2
IT IS IRRELEVANT TO CAN ONLY

00:53:11.689 --> 00:53:15.025 region:rollup2
CAUSE HARM TO SOMEONE HERE IN

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:15.859 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT.

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:17.695 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE WOULD BE USED

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:19.096 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEM IN A WAY THAT HAS

00:53:17.695 --> 00:53:20.397 region:rollup2
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CASE.

00:53:19.096 --> 00:53:22.533 region:rollup2
I AM VERY GLAD YOU BROUGHT

00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:24.334 region:rollup2
FORWARD I THINK IT ALSO GOES TO

00:53:22.533 --> 00:53:25.702 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT.

00:53:24.334 --> 00:53:27.705 region:rollup2
SO MANY TIMES WE HAVE WITNESSES

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:29.973 region:rollup2
AND EVEN VICTIMS WHO ARE NOT

00:53:27.705 --> 00:53:32.509 region:rollup2
WILLING TO COME FORWARD. AND IT

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:34.678 region:rollup2
DOES BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE FOR

00:53:32.509 --> 00:53:36.013 region:rollup2
ALL OF US WHEN VICTIMS AND

00:53:34.678 --> 00:53:38.248 region:rollup2
WITNESSES ARE NOT WILLING TO

00:53:36.013 --> 00:53:40.117 region:rollup2
COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE HARM

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:42.553 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BECOME TO THEM. OR TO

00:53:40.117 --> 00:53:43.153 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILIES SO AGAIN I WANT

00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:44.655 region:rollup2
TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

00:53:43.153 --> 00:53:47.691 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

00:53:44.655 --> 00:53:49.026 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SCAN HIM.

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:50.961 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING

00:53:49.026 --> 00:53:52.329 region:rollup2
THIS I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL

00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:53.130 region:rollup2
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUICK

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:55.165 region:rollup2
COMMENTS AND THEN.

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:57.401 region:rollup2
TWO QUESTIONS.

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:58.869 region:rollup2
ON THE COMMENT FRONT.

00:53:57.401 --> 00:54:00.270 region:rollup2
GLAD TO SEE THE DA'S ASSOCIATION

00:53:58.869 --> 00:54:01.538 region:rollup2
AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS BEHIND

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:03.340 region:rollup2
A BILL THAT'S AN UNUSUAL

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:05.042 region:rollup2
ALIGNMENT BUT I THINK THAT'S.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:07.511 region:rollup2
INDICATIVE OF IT BEING GOOD

00:54:05.042 --> 00:54:09.346 region:rollup2
POLICY I LIKE THE FACT.

00:54:07.511 --> 00:54:10.047 region:rollup2
I THINK IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:11.749 region:rollup2
STATUS IS PROBABLY NOT BE

00:54:10.047 --> 00:54:12.683 region:rollup2
RELEVANT.

00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:14.284 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN NARROW

00:54:12.683 --> 00:54:15.552 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MIGHT BE.

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:16.954 region:rollup2
ELEMENT OF A CRIME OR SOMETHING

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:19.423 region:rollup2
OF THAT SORT.

00:54:16.954 --> 00:54:21.325 region:rollup2
OR POTENTIALLY RELEVANT TO

00:54:19.423 --> 00:54:23.894 region:rollup2
CREDIBILITY AND VERY ISOLATED

00:54:21.325 --> 00:54:25.996 region:rollup2
NARROW CIRCUMSTANCE I LIKE THE

00:54:23.894 --> 00:54:27.831 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THERE'S.

00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:29.299 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:31.135 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATION

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:33.170 region:rollup2
CAN BE MADE I THINK THAT'S

00:54:31.135 --> 00:54:34.204 region:rollup2
A POSITIVE THING AND I THINK

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:35.939 region:rollup2
WITNESSED COOPERATIONS BIG

00:54:34.204 --> 00:54:37.341 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:39.276 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ITS BAD FOR THE

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:39.843 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:41.778 region:rollup2
A BAD FOR VICTIMS RIGHTS BAD

00:54:39.843 --> 00:54:43.147 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:44.748 region:rollup2
THE RIGHTS DEFENDANTS I THINK

00:54:43.147 --> 00:54:45.883 region:rollup2
IT'S BAD FOR EVERYBODY.

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:47.551 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE

00:54:45.883 --> 00:54:49.753 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID.

00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:51.221 region:rollup2
TO COME FORWARD AND TESTIFY.

00:54:49.753 --> 00:54:52.222 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T LIKE TRIAL BY AMBUSH

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:52.389 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S.

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:55.425 region:rollup2
OF.

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:56.794 region:rollup2
.

00:54:55.425 --> 00:54:57.995 region:rollup2
AND A RONI ITS WAY TO PRACTICE

00:54:56.794 --> 00:54:59.897 region:rollup2
LAW BUT LET'S NOT DELUDE

00:54:57.995 --> 00:55:00.764 region:rollup2
OURSELVES PEOPLE DO IT.

00:54:59.897 --> 00:55:02.633 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THIS PROPOSAL

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:04.768 region:rollup2
WILL WILL HELP.

00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:06.503 region:rollup2
EMIRATE THAT CONCERN AS WELL.

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:07.838 region:rollup2
MY QUESTIONS ARE ONE.

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:08.872 region:rollup2
AND IS THERE ANY CONTEMPLATED

00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:09.573 region:rollup2
REMEDY FOR SOMETHING THAT

00:55:08.872 --> 00:55:11.642 region:rollup2
VIOLATES THIS.

00:55:09.573 --> 00:55:12.609 region:rollup2
.

00:55:11.642 --> 00:55:14.178 region:rollup2
WOULD IT BE A MIS TRIAL

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:15.846 region:rollup2
SITUATION IF A PROSECUTOR

00:55:14.178 --> 00:55:18.048 region:rollup2
VIOLATED OR WOULD IT BE. A

00:55:15.846 --> 00:55:18.615 region:rollup2
SANCTION HERBAL TYPE THING AND

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:20.150 region:rollup2
IT'S FINE IF IT'S NOT BUT I

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.751 region:rollup2
JUST.

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:21.685 region:rollup2
CURIOUS AND MY SECOND QUESTION

00:55:20.751 --> 00:55:23.220 region:rollup2
IS.

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:24.555 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DUE IF THIS

00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:26.223 region:rollup2
PASSES AND IT'S PROBABLY OUTSIDE

00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:28.058 region:rollup2
THE POLICY OF THE BILL BUT JUST

00:55:26.223 --> 00:55:29.059 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF?

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:30.727 region:rollup2
INFORMING THE BAR AND

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:32.563 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS BECAUSE THIS.

00:55:30.727 --> 00:55:33.697 region:rollup2
IS A PRETTY BIG CHANGE IF THIS

00:55:32.563 --> 00:55:35.232 region:rollup2
IS SIGNED INTO LAW HOW WE GOING

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:36.233 region:rollup2
TO LET.

00:55:35.232 --> 00:55:38.368 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS NOW SO THE

00:55:36.233 --> 00:55:38.869 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS ARE NOT.

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:39.203 region:rollup2
RUNNING AFOUL OF THE NEW

00:55:38.869 --> 00:55:41.505 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT.

00:55:39.203 --> 00:55:42.239 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:55:41.505 --> 00:55:42.973 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE

00:55:42.239 --> 00:55:44.174 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

00:55:42.973 --> 00:55:46.343 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:48.145 region:rollup2
AS WITH ANY.

00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:49.780 region:rollup2
.

00:55:48.145 --> 00:55:50.948 region:rollup2
PROVISION AND THE EVIDENCE CODE

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:52.850 region:rollup2
OUT COURTS DO HAVE THE ABILITY

00:55:50.948 --> 00:55:54.284 region:rollup2
TO.

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:55.252 region:rollup2
THANK CHAIRMAN ATTORNEY WHO.

00:55:54.284 --> 00:55:56.820 region:rollup2
WHO VIOLATES A PARTICULARLY IF

00:55:55.252 --> 00:55:58.021 region:rollup2
THAT'S

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.489 region:rollup2
NOT INNOCENT?

00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:01.625 region:rollup2
VIOLATION.

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:03.527 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY DO HAVE THOSE TOOLS

00:56:01.625 --> 00:56:04.328 region:rollup2
ARE AT THE STATE BAR ACTUALLY

00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:05.462 region:rollup2
THAT SERVICES COULD THAT'S

00:56:04.328 --> 00:56:07.397 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AT THE SAME

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:08.765 region:rollup2
TIME THEY APPROACH ME. WITH HIS

00:56:07.397 --> 00:56:10.400 region:rollup2
BILL IDEA THEY ALSO SUBMITTED A

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:11.568 region:rollup2
REQUEST TO THE STATE BAR TO

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.571 region:rollup2
CONSIDER RULE QUIRK.

00:56:11.568 --> 00:56:16.106 region:rollup2
AND THE STATE BAR IS EVALUATING

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:19.076 region:rollup2
AYE DOT SO IT IS THEY THE STATE

00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:20.677 region:rollup2
BAR MAY ALSO ADOPT ON ITS OWN A

00:56:19.076 --> 00:56:23.480 region:rollup2
RULE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT SO

00:56:20.677 --> 00:56:24.781 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE THAT DUAL. ATTRACT

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.082 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THERE

00:56:24.781 --> 00:56:27.918 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:56:25.082 --> 00:56:28.485 region:rollup2
GOOD IT WILL BE ENFORCEABLE AYE

00:56:27.918 --> 00:56:30.487 region:rollup2
AND.

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:32.723 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I BELIEVE STATE BAR IS

00:56:30.487 --> 00:56:34.424 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE OF I

00:56:32.723 --> 00:56:38.128 region:rollup2
BELIEVE I'M CONFIDENT THEY WILL

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:39.997 region:rollup2
HELP GET THE WORD OUT SO THAT

00:56:38.128 --> 00:56:41.732 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS AT NO.

00:56:39.997 --> 00:56:43.533 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE GOOD.

00:56:41.732 --> 00:56:44.167 region:rollup2
POINTS MISTER VICE CHAIR WITH

00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:46.103 region:rollup2
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:47.671 region:rollup2
IT'S.

00:56:46.103 --> 00:56:49.840 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES IN LITIGATION SOME

00:56:47.671 --> 00:56:51.375 region:rollup2
FACTORS DRAWN TO TRY AND

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.510 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE A JURY ABOUT A WITNESS

00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:54.878 region:rollup2
CREDIBILITY. BUT IN THIS CASE

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:55.679 region:rollup2
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE

00:56:54.878 --> 00:56:56.747 region:rollup2
BUT IT COULD ALSO HAVE

00:56:55.679 --> 00:56:57.681 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT THAT'S MENTAL FACTS

00:56:56.747 --> 00:56:59.316 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

00:56:57.681 --> 00:56:59.816 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY AND THAT'S WHY. THIS

00:56:59.316 --> 00:57:02.786 region:rollup2
IS A. VERY GOOD APPROACH

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:03.387 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:05.956 region:rollup2
THOSE WITNESSES ARE GONNA BE

00:57:03.387 --> 00:57:06.857 region:rollup2
FEARFUL FOR COMING FORWARD.

00:57:05.956 --> 00:57:08.825 region:rollup2
IF IMMIGRATION STATUS IS JUST

00:57:06.857 --> 00:57:09.927 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:11.528 region:rollup2
AS A WAY OF INTIMIDATING A

00:57:09.927 --> 00:57:12.930 region:rollup2
WITNESS THAN OTHER WITNESSES ARE

00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:14.131 region:rollup2
NOT LIKELY TO COME FORWARD SO

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:15.365 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S THE DILEMMA WE

00:57:14.131 --> 00:57:17.200 region:rollup2
FIND OURSELVES IN IN THE MIDDLE

00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:18.335 region:rollup2
OF THIS.

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.903 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT IS BY NATURE SET UP

00:57:18.335 --> 00:57:23.707 region:rollup2
TO BE.

00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:25.375 region:rollup2
CONTROVERSY AND AND AND DRIVEN.

00:57:23.707 --> 00:57:26.510 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS KALRA

00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:27.577 region:rollup2
DIDN'T DISAPPROVE OF THANK

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:29.112 region:rollup2
MICHELLE VERY BRIEFLY.

00:57:27.577 --> 00:57:30.280 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SENATOR WHEN THIS

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:32.149 region:rollup2
FLORIDA SOME OF THAT WORK IS A

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:34.117 region:rollup2
PUBLIC DEFENDER. OF FOR THAT IN

00:57:32.149 --> 00:57:34.885 region:rollup2
YEARS I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE

00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:35.552 region:rollup2
ABLE TO WORK.

00:57:34.885 --> 00:57:37.254 region:rollup2
BUT BOTH.

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:38.388 region:rollup2
PUT THE DISK INTERNEES AND AS

00:57:37.254 --> 00:57:40.857 region:rollup2
WELL AS PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO COME

00:57:38.388 --> 00:57:42.559 region:rollup2
TO. A RESOLUTION THAT ALLOWED

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:43.827 region:rollup2
FOR BOTH TO TO DO THEIR JOB AND

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:45.162 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE MANNER.

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:47.397 region:rollup2
I CAN THINK OF A NUMBER OF

00:57:45.162 --> 00:57:48.899 region:rollup2
OCCASIONS WHERE IF.

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:50.033 region:rollup2
IMMIGRATION STATUS WOULD HAVE

00:57:48.899 --> 00:57:51.335 region:rollup2
BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE BEEN CALLED

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:53.136 region:rollup2
INTO QUESTION A LOT OF.

00:57:51.335 --> 00:57:54.771 region:rollup2
WITNESSES A OF MINE THAT I HAD

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:56.006 region:rollup2
IN DEFENSE OF CLIENTS WOULD

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:57.708 region:rollup2
HESITATE TO COME FORWARD AS

00:57:56.006 --> 00:57:58.942 region:rollup2
WITNESSES. AND SO I THINK IT

02:17:07.052 --> 02:17:10.322 region:rollup2
WE'RE WILLING TO DO THAT.

02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:12.224 region:rollup2
THIS BILL REALLY IS ABOUT

REASONABLE TIME FRAMES AND AND

02:17:12.224 --> 02:17:15.160 region:rollup2
WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THE

02:17:13.759 --> 02:17:17.229 region:rollup2

BETWEEN STAINING APARTMENT. AND

02:17:29.308 --> 02:17:32.444 region:rollup2

ONE OF THE GREATEST DRIVERS OF

RELATIVELY GOOD TENANTS RIGHTS

02:22:19.831 --> 02:22:22.768 region:rollup2
BUT MANY LANDLORDS CHOOSE TO

02:22:21.299 --> 02:22:24.503 region:rollup2
IGNORE THE PROCEDURES LAID OUT

02:22:22.768 --> 02:22:26.371 region:rollup2
IN A RENTED JUST MEANT PROGRAM.

BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

02:28:47.185 --> 02:28:55.994 region:rollup2
COMMENTS THIS DRESS.

02:28:53.858 --> 02:28:57.395 region:rollup2
I AM I AM I THERE'S NO QUESTION

02:28:55.994 --> 02:28:58.663 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO HAVE

02:28:57.395 --> 02:29:00.465 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FOR DEALING IN ANY

02:28:58.663 --> 02:29:01.466 region:rollup2
KIND OF A BUSINESS.

02:29:00.465 --> 02:29:02.834 region:rollup2
WE DON'T REQUIRE THIS OF OTHER

02:29:01.466 --> 02:29:04.402 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES

02:29:02.834 --> 02:29:05.837 region:rollup2
THEY CAN OPEN UP THEIR SHOP AND

02:29:04.402 --> 02:29:09.674 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A BUSINESS AND THEY'RE

02:29:05.837 --> 02:29:11.643 region:rollup2
PROVIDING. EITHER SERVICE OR A.

02:29:09.674 --> 02:29:13.645 region:rollup2
POOR SELLING GOODS WITHOUT BEING

02:29:11.643 --> 02:29:14.712 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO BE CERTIFIED.

02:29:13.645 --> 02:29:16.714 region:rollup2
TO OWN A BUSINESS

02:29:14.712 --> 02:29:18.783 region:rollup2
AND.

02:29:16.714 --> 02:29:21.553 region:rollup2
THAT IS ONE OF MY CONCERNS.

02:29:18.783 --> 02:29:22.487 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU JUST OWN TWO UNITS

02:29:21.553 --> 02:29:24.088 region:rollup2
YOU ALREADY ARE REQUIRED TO DO

02:29:22.487 --> 02:29:26.024 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:29:24.088 --> 02:29:27.292 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED BUT

02:29:26.024 --> 02:29:28.793 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ISSUE OF COURSE IS THE

02:29:27.292 --> 02:29:30.595 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE SO NO THE COURSES WILL

02:29:28.793 --> 02:29:33.131 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE OFFERED.

02:29:30.595 --> 02:29:34.232 region:rollup2
IN MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.

02:29:33.131 --> 02:29:34.999 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF EDUCATION

02:29:34.232 --> 02:29:36.100 region:rollup2
I THINK IS GOOD.

02:29:34.999 --> 02:29:37.602 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:39.604 region:rollup2
THE

02:29:37.602 --> 02:29:41.172 region:rollup2
ACQUIREMENT OF A CERTIFICATION.

02:29:39.604 --> 02:29:42.874 region:rollup2
.

02:29:41.172 --> 02:29:44.442 region:rollup2
IT

02:29:42.874 --> 02:29:46.444 region:rollup2
FOR SOMEONE WHO OWNS.

02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:48.847 region:rollup2
SO LITTLE.

02:29:46.444 --> 02:29:50.148 region:rollup2

02:30:59.584 --> 02:31:02.153 region:rollup2

SOMETHING THAT.

02:31:18.069 --> 02:31:21.739 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T CRITICS UP A

02:31:19.904 --> 02:31:23.942 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE IN THE

02:31:21.739 --> 02:31:25.343 region:rollup2

02:40:14.305 --> 02:40:17.575 region:rollup2
AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE

02:40:15.973 --> 02:40:19.877 region:rollup2

02:40:17.575 --> 02:40:21.779 region:rollup2
ROLE IN HELPING TO PROBLEM SOLVE

02:40:19.877 --> 02:40:23.514 region:rollup2
AT THE WORKPLACE AND THAT CAN

02:40:21.779 --> 02:40:24.882 region:rollup2
ONLY HAPPEN WHEN WORKERS KNOW

02:40:23.514 --> 02:40:26.617 region:rollup2

02:40:45.302 --> 02:40:49.039 region:rollup2
KIND OF IRONIC THAT. UP

02:40:47.037 --> 02:40:50.140 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION HAS SUCH A PROBLEM

02:40:49.039 --> 02:40:51.342 region:rollup2
WITH THIS IDEA THAT WORKERS

02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:52.576 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ABLE TO TALK

02:40:51.342 --> 02:40:55.246 region:rollup2

02:41:02.019 --> 02:41:04.255 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT FULL

02:41:02.753 --> 02:41:05.956 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION.

02:41:04.255 --> 02:41:07.491 region:rollup2
I WORKED AS A UNION REP FOR MANY

02:41:05.956 --> 02:41:08.459 region:rollup2
YEARS BEFORE I CAME HERE TO

02:41:07.491 --> 02:41:10.394 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO.

02:41:08.459 --> 02:41:12.296 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME IT WOULD NEVER

02:41:10.394 --> 02:41:14.832 region:rollup2
HAVE OCCURRED TO ME THAT I COULD

02:41:12.296 --> 02:41:16.734 region:rollup2
BE FORCED TO TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT

02:41:14.832 --> 02:41:19.403 region:rollup2
MEMBERS TOLD ME CONFIDENTIALLY

02:41:16.734 --> 02:41:20.804 region:rollup2
THERE IS SUCH A. AN ASSUMPTION

02:41:19.403 --> 02:41:22.306 region:rollup2
ON THE PART OF THE PARTY IS WHEN

02:41:20.804 --> 02:41:23.407 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GRIEVANCES

02:41:22.306 --> 02:41:24.642 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S

02:41:23.407 --> 02:41:26.243 region:rollup2
HAPPENING AT THE WORKPLACE

02:41:24.642 --> 02:41:28.178 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT'S AROUND A

02:41:26.243 --> 02:41:29.346 region:rollup2
MORE SENSITIVE TOPICS LIKE

02:41:28.178 --> 02:41:31.215 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT. RACIAL

02:41:29.346 --> 02:41:32.850 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION A BUT ALSO WHEN

02:41:31.215 --> 02:41:35.319 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

02:41:32.850 --> 02:41:36.120 region:rollup2
RETALIATION FAVORITISM ALL KINDS

02:41:35.319 --> 02:41:37.588 region:rollup2
OF ISSUES THAT HAPPEN AT A

02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:39.924 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE THERE IS THAT

02:41:37.588 --> 02:41:41.425 region:rollup2
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY. AND I

02:41:39.924 --> 02:41:43.127 region:rollup2
THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS

02:41:41.425 --> 02:41:45.296 region:rollup2
IS REALLY ABOUT ALLOWING THE

02:41:43.127 --> 02:41:47.131 region:rollup2
UNION REP TO DO THAT ESSENTIAL

02:41:45.296 --> 02:41:49.567 region:rollup2

HAVING TO ADVISE WORKERS.

IF YOU TELL ME THAT I COULD

02:41:51.068 --> 02:41:54.204 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY HAVE TO BE A WITNESS

02:41:52.503 --> 02:41:55.706 region:rollup2
AGAINST YOU THEY SHOULD HAVE THE

AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE I JUST

02:43:20.758 --> 02:43:22.826 region:rollup2
WANTED TO REFERENCE A FEW THINGS

02:43:21.659 --> 02:43:24.728 region:rollup2
DONE IN THE ANALYSIS WITH

PRIVILEGE YOU CAN REFUSE.

02:43:27.031 --> 02:43:29.933 region:rollup2
FOR ANOTHER THIRD PARTY TO

DISCLOSE THE PRIVILEGE I THINK

02:43:29.933 --> 02:43:33.370 region:rollup2
THE CONFUSION ON WITH REGARDS TO

02:43:31.735 --> 02:43:34.138 region:rollup2
OUR INTERPRETATION IS THE

02:43:33.370 --> 02:43:35.439 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY THAT IS

02:43:34.138 --> 02:43:37.107 region:rollup2
UTILIZED WITHIN THAT EXISTING

EMPLOYEE THOSE ARE LIKE FIVE

02:43:43.781 --> 02:43:46.016 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PARTIES ALL INCLUDED

02:43:44.915 --> 02:43:47.384 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT SAME PARAGRAPH AND

02:43:46.016 --> 02:43:49.086 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT STATUTORY

02:43:47.384 --> 02:43:50.387 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION. THE JNA COURT

02:43:49.086 --> 02:43:50.754 region:rollup2
WHEN APPLYING THIS WILL LOOK IN

02:43:50.387 --> 02:43:53.991 region:rollup2
ME.

02:43:50.754 --> 02:43:55.659 region:rollup2
AND SOON THAT THE. LEGISLATURE

02:43:53.991 --> 02:43:57.661 region:rollup2
MEANT TO USE DIFFERENT TERMS.

02:43:55.659 --> 02:43:58.629 region:rollup2
IN THAT SECTION AND WE'RE CREEK

02:43:57.661 --> 02:43:59.863 region:rollup2
CONFUSION WITH REGARDS TO THE

02:43:58.629 --> 02:44:01.165 region:rollup2
APPLICABILITY OF THIS

02:43:59.863 --> 02:44:02.433 region:rollup2
EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGE WHO IT

02:44:01.165 --> 02:44:03.634 region:rollup2
PLACE TO WHO CAN REFUSE

02:44:02.433 --> 02:44:04.835 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE WHO CAN ASSERT THE

02:44:03.634 --> 02:44:06.303 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE THAT WE HAVE. AYE

02:44:04.835 --> 02:44:07.371 region:rollup2
CONFUSION ON THAT AND RIGHT NOW

02:44:06.303 --> 02:44:09.073 region:rollup2
IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHAT THEY'RE

02:44:07.371 --> 02:44:11.075 region:rollup2
NOT ON THE UNION AGING COULD IN

02:44:09.073 --> 02:44:13.077 region:rollup2
FACT OF. A ISSUE THE PRIVILEGE

02:44:11.075 --> 02:44:15.012 region:rollup2
AND I PREVENT A THIRD PARTY FROM

02:44:13.077 --> 02:44:16.013 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY DISCLOSING ANY OF

02:44:15.012 --> 02:44:16.647 region:rollup2
THIS COMMUNICATIONS.

02:44:16.013 --> 02:44:17.614 region:rollup2
THAT LEADS US EVEN IF IT WAS

02:44:16.647 --> 02:44:18.549 region:rollup2
JUST ONLY THE REPRESENT OF

02:44:17.614 --> 02:44:19.950 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE WHO COULD ASSERT THE

02:44:18.549 --> 02:44:21.518 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE WE WOULD STILL HAVE

02:44:19.950 --> 02:44:22.586 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WE DO BELIEVE. ON THAT

02:44:21.518 --> 02:44:23.554 region:rollup2
THIS COULD INTERFERE WITH

02:44:22.586 --> 02:44:24.922 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN THE

02:44:23.554 --> 02:44:26.090 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AND WITH REGARDS THE

02:44:24.922 --> 02:44:27.925 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS THAT SAYS THIS IS AN

02:44:26.090 --> 02:44:29.093 region:rollup2
AVERAGE THREE PRIVILEGE THAT

02:44:27.925 --> 02:44:31.428 region:rollup2
ONLY COMES UP AN ADJUDICATORY.

02:44:29.093 --> 02:44:32.362 region:rollup2
ADJUDICATORY UP PROCEEDINGS WE

02:44:31.428 --> 02:44:33.864 region:rollup2
THINK THE APPLICATION OF A

02:44:32.362 --> 02:44:34.932 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE IS MUCH MORE EXPANSIVE

02:44:33.864 --> 02:44:36.467 region:rollup2
THAN THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:44:34.932 --> 02:44:37.434 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE IF AN

02:44:36.467 --> 02:44:39.069 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER WERE TO GO AND

02:44:37.434 --> 02:44:39.536 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE A WORKPLACE ISSUE.

02:44:39.069 --> 02:44:41.338 region:rollup2
AND.

02:44:39.536 --> 02:44:42.740 region:rollup2
ASK THE EMPLOYEE WHETHER OR NOT

02:44:41.338 --> 02:44:44.241 region:rollup2
HE CONSULTED AND TURNING THE

02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:45.976 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY EMPLOYEE RESPONDED YES

02:44:44.241 --> 02:44:46.910 region:rollup2
THAT EMPLOYER WOULD NOT BE ABLE

02:44:45.976 --> 02:44:48.212 region:rollup2
TO ASK DURING THAT INTERVIEW

02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:49.213 region:rollup2
WHAT THE COMMUNICATION WAS

02:44:48.212 --> 02:44:50.848 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE ATTORNEY AND THE

02:44:49.213 --> 02:44:51.782 region:rollup2
CLIENT. BECAUSE AGAIN THEY WOULD

02:44:50.848 --> 02:44:53.550 region:rollup2
ASSERT THE ATTORNEY CLIENT

02:44:51.782 --> 02:44:54.785 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE IF THEY DIDN'T IF THEY

02:44:53.550 --> 02:44:56.120 region:rollup2
DISCLOSE THAT COMMUNICATION

02:44:54.785 --> 02:44:57.454 region:rollup2
WOULD NO LONGER BE A PRIVILEGED

02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:58.655 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION AND SO I THINK THE

02:44:57.454 --> 02:45:00.190 region:rollup2
APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVILEGE

02:44:58.655 --> 02:45:01.759 region:rollup2
GOES FAR BEYOND EDGE AS SIMPLY A

02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:03.260 region:rollup2
COURT PROCEEDING. OR SIMILAR

02:45:01.759 --> 02:45:05.696 region:rollup2
TYPE OF PROCEEDING BECAUSE IT'S

02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:07.197 region:rollup2
UTILIZED ALL THE TIME TO ASSERT.

02:45:05.696 --> 02:45:07.731 region:rollup2
THE PRIVILEGE WHENEVER A

02:45:07.197 --> 02:45:08.999 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL OR POTENTIAL

02:45:07.731 --> 02:45:10.701 region:rollup2
