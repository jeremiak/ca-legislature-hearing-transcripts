THANK YOU MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE I RISE TO PRESENT SB SIX TWENTY FOR A BILL THAT SEEKS TO ESTABLISH AND PROMOTE. ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY IN OUTDOOR ACCESS AS A GOAL FOR ALL STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS THAT MANAGE NATURAL REEF RESOURCES. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE WILL GLADLY ACCEPT AMENDMENTS ARE PROPOSED. CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG. AND A WONDERFUL TRADITION OF TRYING TO PROVOKE ACCESS- IN OUR PARKS AND OUR COASTLINE. AND HELPING TO CREATE PROGRAMS THAT WILL- IMPROVE ACCESS HOWEVER DURING THE PANDEMIC. OF A. WE SAW THAT LOTS AND LOTS OF WORK STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE THE IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN ON THE STAND AT HOME ORDER REALLY MAGNIFIED THE OBSTACLES OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE FACED IN ACCESSING. HOW DOOR SPACES AND RECREATION CURRENTLY THERE IS NO EXPLICIT AUTHORITY FOR STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION BY ADDRESSING THESE BARRIERS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST TO CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY LACKED THEM FACE DISPROPORTIONATE BARRIERS TO ACCESS. SB SIX TWENTY FOUR WOULD ADD A NEW DIVISION TO THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE TO ADDRESS THIS. WE HAVE JOSE GONZALEZ REPRESENTING THE LATINO OUTDOORS IN PARKS NOW COALITION THAT I BELIEVE IS ON THE LINE THAT WOULD LIKE TO OF. EXPAND ON MY COMMENTS BUT- I HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD TO THIS BILL HAS NOT RECEIVED- ANY OPPOSITION AND- I ALSO BELIEVE THIS BILL HASN'T RECEIVED ANY NO VOTES FOR THE PROCESS AS WELL SO IT LOOKS TO HAVE ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT. ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THE MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU MISTER WAY SO. LET'S OPEN UP THE PHONE LINES FOR THE FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. HELLO JOSE HERE. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES GREAT THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL GOOD MORNING SHARON MEMBERS- GAS YES THEY DO APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX TWO FOUR- MY NAME IS JOSE GONZALEZ AND I'M THE FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR IMAGES SELECTING ALL DOORS AND A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE PARKS NOW COALITION BOTH OF WHICH ARE EMBEDDED WITH VALUES OF THE OUTDOOR EQUITY. TO STARTED HAS BEEN NOTED IT'S THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS THE TIME SPENT OUTDOORS ARE UNDENIABLE WHICH WAS ALSO CLEARLY NOTED AN AMPLIFIED TO UNDERSTAND THAT MAKE BUT THESE BENEFITS AND OUTDOOR SPACES AND RECREATION ARE NOT EQUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE SOMETHING WHICH WAS ALSO- UNFORTUNATELY AMPLIFIED. NO RETURN BUT DEMOCRATS. HOW TO STAND PAUL ISN'T. SUCH AS THE STATE- WHY PARKS PROGRAM IN THE OUTDOOR EQUITY GRANTS PROGRAM. BOTH OF WHICH WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THEY EXIST- THE STATE HAD MADE PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE BARRIERS THAT HAS MADE THE OUTDOORS INACCESSIBLE FOR SOME PEOPLE. EQUITABLE ACCESS IS MORE ABOUT THAN JUST PHYSICAL ACCESS IN ACHIEVING IT WILL REQUIRE ATTENTION TO REDUCING OTHER SOCIAL CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS FOR THOSE THAT FACE THEM. ADDITIONALLY EQUITABLE ACCESS CANNOT BE A CALL WE ADVANCE ONLY IN CERTAIN CONTEXTS UNDER SPECIFIC PROGRAMS BUT SOMETHING WE NEED TO PROMOTE IN EVERY INSTANCE POSSIBLE AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ACHIEVING SOME TAX WHAT I CONSIDER SOME TACTICAL SUCCESSES TO CURRENT PROGRAMS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO SO WITHIN A MORE ENCOMPASSING STRATEGIC. VISION FRAMEWORK. SB SIX TWENTY FOUR WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT THIS IS THE CASE BY STATUS IN THAT IT IS THE POLICY OF THE STATE TO ENSURE ALL PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE STATE'S NATURAL CULTURAL RESOURCES. PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THOSE THAT HISTORICALLY FACED DISPROPORTIONATE BARRIERS AND EXCLUSION. THE BILL ALSO AUTHORIZES THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY IN THE ENTITIES HOUSE WITHIN IT I TO TAKE DELIBERATE ACTION TO IDENTIFY AND REMOVE BARRIERS TO EQUITABLE ACCESS PRIORITISING THOSE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER REPRESENTED IN THE OUTDOORS. IN TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE AND ALL CAN ENJOY THE OUTDOORS AND IT'S BROAD IN SCOPE AND INCLUDES SCOUT. AND THE BENEFITS THAT IT PROVIDES SOMETHING THAT I CONSIDER TO BE QUINTESSENTIALLY CALIFORNIA. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR HOW WEST OF FORTY THREE TO SHIP ON THE STILL. AND WE RESPECT RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I INFO ON THIS. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE IN.

IT WAS GOOD TO STAND HERE. GOOD OLD DAYS. I WANT TO- INITIALLY- EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND TO THINK PABLO YOUR STAFF SHARE FOR A WORKING WITH US ON THIS MEASURES WAS A LAST MINUTE REFERRAL TO DOUBLE REFERRAL SO THE TIMELINE FOR THE AMENDMENTS AND THE MECHANICS OF GETTING THINGS DONE WERE A LITTLE TIGHT. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. ON BRIEFLY EVERYBODY KNOWS. IN THE HEADLINES OF THE NEWSPAPERS WE ARE FACING AN EXTRAORDINARY DROPPED. WE HAVE WORK TO I WORK WITH THE MEASURE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN SERIES OF. EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE ON WATER CONSERVATION. AND THERE WAS A HOLE IN THAT PROCESS FOR SMALL WATER DISTRICTS DISTRICTS THAT SERVE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE. **** UPS. IN THIS COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE. THAT ARE SUFFERING EXTRAORDINARILY NOT BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT YOU HAVE TO HAVE TRUCKED IN WATER IT'S REALLY A HORRIBLE SITUATION. SO WE MADE A RECOMMENDATION ONE OF THE REPORTS IT WAS PART OF THIS EFFORT. TO TRY TO COME UP WITH STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THE SMALLER DISTRICTS AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE GOVERNORS OFFICE SO. WE PUT THIS. BILL TOGETHER TO BASICALLY REQUIRE. THESE DISTRICTS THESE- SMALLER DISTRICTS TO PREPARE FOR THE DROUGHT TO DEAL WITH DRIED WELLS TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE NOT VERY BIG PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEIR EXTRAORDINARY PROBLEMS FOR CALIFORNIANS INCO SMALLER COMMUNITIES IN THE IMPACTS THAT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE ON THEIR LIVES AND THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND SO I WE'VE GOT A COUPLE WITNESSES AND I DO WANT TO- ADDRESS JUST FOR A MOMENT IF I COULD. ARM THE OPPOSITION BY THE- COUNTIES. I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME. I CHAIRED THE GOVERNANCE FINANCE COMMITTEE IN THE OTHER HOUSE. AND I WROTE FOR FOUR YEARS THE LAST CALL ACT KNOCKS CORTESE HERTZBERG ACT IT'S BEEN A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME WORKING WITH COUNTIES. COUNTY NOW TELLS US THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING WITH THEM WHICH IS JUST NOT ACCURATE IN THE LETTER AND IT IS- QUITE AMAZING TO ME- WE REACHED OUT TO THEM ON FEBRUARY TENTH TWO INTRODUCED THE BILL. AND WE HAD THESE LATE AMENDMENTS WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AND OUR STAFF WAS INVOLVED WITH THEM EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THE WAY. I DON'T MIND IF SOMEONE OPPOSES A MEASURE IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. OUR FAMILIES OPPOSE THINGS WE WANT TO DO THAT'S PART OF OUR BUSINESS AS WE TALK ABOUT. VARIOUS ISSUES OF PUBLIC POLICY BUT WHAT I DO MIND. IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT GROUPS. LIKE THE COUNTIES WHO I HOLD IN HIGH REGARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY MEMORY. BEING IN THIS BUSINESS FOR DECADES. TELLS US THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THEM AND THAT'S JUST NOT ACCURATE. PART OF IT WAS THE TIMING AT THE LAST MINUTE. BUT EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THE LOOP. IN THIS STUFF. AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW IS. A MEMBER OF. THE OTHER HOUSES FORMER LEADER OF THIS HOUSE I HOLD THIS PROCESS IN HIGH REGARD IT WOULD NEVER. DO ANYTHING. AS A PROFESSIONAL IN THIS BUSINESS. THAT EVER SIDE SWIPED ANYBODY I MIGHT HIT HIM IN THE NOSE ON AN ISSUE THAT I DIDN'T LIKE A MONTH. SOME PEOPLE KNOW THAT. BUT I WOULD NEVER SITES WIPE THEM SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR THIS WAS A LAST MINUTE OPPOSITION BY THE WAY. THE OPPOSITION LETTER FROM THE COUNTY DID NOT EVEN COME TO MY OFFICE WE ONLY SAW. THAT WAS PUT ON THE ELECTRONIC NOTIFICATION THAT THERE WAS IN OPPOSITION TO IT. STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN EXCELLENT WORKING WITH US THE LAST MINUTE BECAUSE LAST NIGHT REFERRALS. AND I WOULD CERTAINLY- ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND- I BELIEVE WE HAVE WITNESSES AND I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE BECAUSE I'M NOT READING ANY PAPERS. SO WHOEVER THEY ARE. PLEASE A GET ON THE TELEPHONE. THANK YOU THE FIRST WITNESS I HAVE IS I'M JONATHAN NELSON FROM A COMMUNITY WATER CENTER. ON THE PHONE.

SO JUST QUICKLY WE AND OUR PARTNERS WERE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE LAST DROUGHT YOU WORK DIRECTLY WITH COMMUNITIES THAT WERE DEVASTATED AND THE LACK ROUTE ONE COMMUNITY IT WAS EACH PORTED OVER THOUSAND BLOCK WATER AT ONE TIME. AND THAT WAS JUST ONE COMMUNITY AND IT WAS PAINFUL- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF BASIC PRACTICE PLANNING AND COORDINATION THE DATE WAS LAST GRAMBLING TO KEEP UP WITH THAT DROUGHT EMERGENCY FAMILIES ARE ONCE AGAIN RIGHT NOW LOSING ACCESS TO WATER WE AND OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PARTNERS. ARE GETTING CALLS NEARLY EVERY DAY FROM FAMILIES THAT ARE BLOCKED OR ARE STRUGGLING WITH ACCESS TO WATER AND IT'S NOT EVEN SUMMER. AND. IT'S ONLY THE SECOND YEAR THAT DROUGHT.

ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MOTION A SECOND. MISTER HERTZBERG WE LIKE TO CLOSE- SORRY. MR LEVINE I TRY TO VICE CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO SENATOR FOR OFFERING THIS BILL LIGHT SIDE. MORE PLANNING ISN'T A BAD THING AND YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE IN YEAR TWO OF THIS DROUGHT BUT IT FEELS LIKE YEAR THREE OF THE NORMAL DROUGHT- IS. CAUSE FOR CONCERN TO PUT IT MILDLY ON THE WAY THAT WE'VE PLANNED FOR WATERS GOT A CHANGE. JUST ENTIRELY HAS TO CHANGE THE- FUTURE DROPS WON'T GET ANY EASIER. AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS- IS REALLY JUST CHANGE THE WAY WE GOT A LOOK AT OUR RESOURCES. AND I YOU KNOW AS I LISTEN TO YOUR OPEN- I BOTH RELATED TO. YOUR GRIPES BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN IN YOUR SHOES AS FAR AS TRYING TO TACKLE A COMPLICATED SPACE AND POLICY. THAT THAT ISN'T ALWAYS EASY AND THE COMMITTEE PROCESS- IT AND HOW WE YOU KNOW WORK THROUGH SOME ISSUES AND HAVE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARISE- AND ALSO YOU KNOW HAVE. THE RHYTHM OF HOW THAT WORKS OUT IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE GAME YOU KNOW AS WE LEAVE THE HOUSE OF ORIGIN AND THEN PEOPLE START PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THE BILLS WE OFTEN YOU KNOW IT'S PART OF THE GRIPES IS OFTEN YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT THE OTHER HOUSE DOES BUT IT'S MORE THAT STAKEHOLDER START TAKING THE LEGISLATION MORE SERIOUSLY. AND AND THEN REALLY START TRYING TO SINK THEIR TEETH INTO THE POLICY WHAT IT MEANS HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT THEM HOW WILL REALLY WORK BECAUSE IN THE FIRST HALF- SO TO SPEAK. NONE OF THAT WORK GOT DONE OR OR DIDN'T ALL GET DONE. SO WE START PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO IT. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO. YOU KNOW ONE EXPRESS THAT I RELATE TO THE FEELINGS THAT YOU HAD ABOUT. HOW FOR TAKING THIS MORE SERIOUSLY BUT ALSO MAYBE THROWING UP SOME ROAD BLOCKS TO SOME OF THE LAUDABLE GOALS THAT YOU HAVE- THAT THAT ARE IN PLACE IN IN THE LEGISLATION BUT ALSO SOME OF THE- MAYBE PERHAPS- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE- MISUNDERSTANDING OF THOSE GOALS AND INTENTIONS AND WHAT THOSE OUTCOMES WILL ULTIMATELY BE AND LEAD TO FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS AFFECTING AND SO I AM SENSITIVE TO BOTH YOUR YOUR SIDE OF THAT STORY- BECAUSE I'VE I'VE LIVED IT. BUT ALSO SENSITIVE TO HOW WE CAN AS WE'RE WORKING THROUGH- AND THAT THIS COMMITTEE PROCESS YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE COMING UP MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT- YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO USE THE WRONG TERMS ABOUT CALLING SOME OF SOME OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE BUT THAT MAY APPEAR OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE TO THEM ABOUT WHAT THEIR DUTIES OBLIGATIONS ARE AND PERHAPS BEING MORE ONEROUS THAN THEY WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE WHICH MAY NOT BE WHAT YOUR INTENTION IS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE SPEED OF WHICH THIS IS OCCURRING- TO THEM NOT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE THAT WE CAN MAYBE CLARIFY THAT A LITTLE BIT DO YOU SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT PLEASE. CERTAINLY HAPPY TO. I AM. MY POINT WASN'T CLEAR CLEARLY THERE'S GREATER. ATTENTION WHEN YOU GET TO THE SECOND HOUSE THAT'S THE CASE. AND THERE WAS OF AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED IN BECAUSE IT WAS DOUBLE REFERRAL THE TIMELINE SURE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. MY CONCERN WASN'T THAT. DOES HAPPEN THAT'S THE NATURE OF OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. Y CONCERN WAS THE REPRESENTATION pCOMMUNICATED I HAVE FOURTEEN INSTANCES WHERE WE DID COMMUNICATE AND THEY NEVER RESPONDED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THAT'S MY I CAN ALSO RELATE TO THAT. I CAN RELATE TO THAT LIKE I CAN'T YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THAT'S HOW YOU DO BUSINESS AND SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD AND MAKE IT CLEAR. AS TO THE SUBSTANCE MONTEREY COUNTY TULARE COUNTY FRESNO COUNTY ALREADY HAVE. A FORM HAS A BOX THAT NEEDS TO BE CHECKED. AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE. ARE JUST A DISINGENUOUS BECAUSE- THE CHECKING OF THE BOXES SELF EXECUTING ITSELF SELECTING SELF CERTIFYING. SO IT'S A REPRESENTATION BY THE INDIVIDUALS THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL WORK. SO WHAT WE'LL WORK IT OUT WITH WILL WORK WITH THEM WILL ALWAYS WORK WITH THEM I JUST WANTED TO STICK IT IN A LITTLE BIT THE I. AND PUT DIRECT PUT ON THE RECORD. DON'T SAY THE MY OFFICE TO WORK WITH YOU AND WE I'VE GOT A EMAIL AFTER EMAIL THE RUN RESPONDED TO. AND THAT'S ALL AND I SUSPECTED THAT SEVEN OTHER PEOPLE I'M JUST AN OLD MAN I'M PUT UP WITH IT.
