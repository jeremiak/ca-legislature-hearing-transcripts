THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- IT'S AN HONOR TO PRESENT AJ ARE SIXTEEN THAT DESIGNATES APRIL TWENTY FOURTH TWENTY NINETEEN AS THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE OF NINETEEN FIFTEEN IN. NINETEEN TWENTY THREE BEGINNING ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN IN AN EFFORT TO RADIC KATE. THE ARMENIAN NATION THE YOUNG TURKS GOVERNMENT OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE SYSTEMATICALLY SLAUGHTERED ARMENIAN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THE GENOCIDE CONTINUED FROM. NINETEEN TWENTY TO NINETEEN TWENTY THREE THIS RESOLUTION PAYS HOMAGE TO THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AMER ARMENIANS THAT WERE KILLED. DURING THIS HORRIFIC PERIOD OF TIME. MEMBERS WHEN WE THINK OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IT'S HARD TO CAPTURE WITH THAT TRULY MEANS. PRIOR TO THE GENOCIDE THERE WERE TWO MILLION ARMENIANS LIVING IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE BUT WITHIN A SHORT TIME THREE QUARTERS OF AN ACCIDENT. ANCIENT I'M SORRY ANCIENT CIVILIZATION PERISHED AND AN ENTIRE NATION WAS NEARLY OBLITERATED. WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS MILLIONS OF STORIES NEVER TOLD? FUTURE GENERATIONS NEVER BORING AND MILLIONS OF SHATTERED FAMILIES AND DREAMS. AS THE HOME OF THE LARGEST POPULATION OF ARMENIAN AMERICANS IN THE UNITED STATES CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZES THE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY HAS MADE THROUGH THEIR LEADERSHIP IN GOVERNMENT AGRICULTURE ACADEMIA BUSINESS AND THE ARTS. HOWEVER IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGE THESE CONTRIBUTIONS WE HAVE THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY. TO CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS TO NOW TO NOT ALLOW THE ATROCITIES AND THE VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTED BY THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AGAINST ARMENIANS. AND OTHER CHRISTIANS TO BE FORGOTTEN THIS IS WHY TODAY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND ASKED FOR THE FIRST ROLE TO BE OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS. THANK YOU MISTER EVANS MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF HR. SIXTEEN OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE WORLD WITNESSED THE SLAUGHTER OF ONE AND A HALF MILLION ARMENIAN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO WERE EXILED FROM THE HISTORIC HOMELAND. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE AMERICA'S LARGEST ARMENIAN AMERICAN DIASPORA. AND MOST OF THEM HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE SURVIVORS AND HAVE EXPERIENCED THE EVIL OF GENOCIDE FIRST HAND. IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING SUPPORTING IN MANY AMERICAN COMMUNITIES AND SEEKING JUSTICE FOR THIS CRIME AS IT HAS GONE ON RECOGNIZE FOR FAR TOO LONG. AS WE CONTINUE TO SEEK JUSTICE FOR THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WE ALSO CELEBRATE THE SURVIVAL OF A PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. GOVERNMENT BUSINESS ARTS AND CULTURE. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I AM PROUD OF OUR STATE AND OUR LEGISLATURE FOR TAKING IMPORTANT STEPS TO EDUCATE OUR CITIZENS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND GENOCIDE. IN HOPES TO RAISE A GENERATION OF LEADERS THAT WILL ALWAYS CHOOSE LOVE OVER HATE. AND TOLERANCE OVER DISCRIMINATION. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON AJ ARE. SIXTEEN THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON MR HOLDEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR AGA ARE. SIXTEEN WHICH DESIGNATES APRIL TWENTY FOURTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AS THE HUNDRED AND FOURTH ANNIVERSARY. OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. THE MASSACRE TOOK PLACE FROM. NINETEEN FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY THREE AND IT BRINGS ME GREAT SADNESS. AS I THINK ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF INNOCENT MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN. WHO LOST THEIR LIVES FROM MASS BURNINGS FORCE DROWNINGS DEATH MARCHES AND POISONING? BRAVE MEN SOUGHT OUT TO PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES BUT REMAIN HELPLESS. WHILE VULNERABLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE EXILED OR EXECUTED AS THEIR IDENTITY SELF WORTH. AND CULTURE WERE SLOWLY BEING PLUCKED FROM CIVILIZATION. TODAY CALIFORNIA IS THE HOME TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ARMENIANS FOUR THOUSAND OF WHICH RESIDE IN MY DISTRICT. AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY THROUGH LITERATURE CULTURE. AND VISUAL ARTS. THE SUFFERING THAT ARMENIAN POPULATION AND THIRD MEANS SOMETHING TO ME NOT BECAUSE IT ILLUSTRATES THE INFRINGEMENT. OF HUMAN RIGHTSBUT BECAUSE IT IS A REMINDER OF THEIR COURAGE AND STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THERE WAS HOLDEN THIS GABRIEL. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF AJ ARE. SIXTEEN TODAY WE REMEMBER THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IN HONOR THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE BRUTALLY CUT SHORT DURING THE FIRST GENOCIDE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. WE STAND WITH THOSE WHO LOST LOVED ONES AND THOSE WHO CAME TO AMERICA TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES. DESPITE THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT'S EFFORT TO DENY HISTORY WE WILL NOT FORGET. WE WILL NOT FORGET THE BRUTALITY THE DISPLACEMENT AND THE MURDER OF MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ARMENIANS. WE WILL NOT FORGET BECAUSE DENIAL OF HISTORICAL FACT DENIES JUSTICE COMPOUNDS INJURY. UNDERMINES HEALING PREVENTS CLOSURE AND ENCOURAGES THOSE WHO SEE GENOCIDE AS LEGITIMATE. INDEED THERE IS NO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN THE WORDS OF ADOLF HITLER WHO IN THE YEARS PRIOR TO THE HOLOCAUST FAMOUSLY ASK. WHO AFTER ALL SPEAKS TODAY OF THE I NEED ANNIHILATION OF THE ARMENIANS? TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE MUST SPEAK OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. WE MUST REMEMBER HISTORY AS IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED AND CONDEMN HATE IN ALL OF ITS FORMS. IN RECENT WEEKS THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY AND MY DISTRICT IN THE WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY HAS BEEN TARGETED BY HATE. THIS IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF HISTORY. TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS IN THE WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WERE VANDALIZED WITH TURKISH FLAGS. THE EQUIVALENT OF HANGING **** FLAGS AT A SYNAGOGUE FOR A JEWISH SCHOOL. INCIDENTS LIKE THESE REMIND US THAT WE MUST REMAIN CONSTANTLY VIGILANT. ONLY BY BEING HONEST ABOUT THE HORRORS OF THE PAST CAN WE HOPE TO PREVENT FUTURE ACTS OF GENOCIDE. IN THAT SPIRIT AND ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR AJ ARE. SIXTEEN THANK YOU RICH GABRIEL DR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I'D TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AJ ARE SIXTEEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. WE APPLAUD THE EFFORTS OF THE ARMENIANS FOR THEIR PURSUIT OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE FOR THE ARMENIAN DURING THEIR MEDIANS A GENOCIDE. AND THE EXPERIENCE OF ARMENIANS UNDER THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF AFRICAN SLAVES OR NATIVE AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS REALLY QUITE INTERESTING THAT WE ARE HERE TALKING ABOUT THIS THE GENOCIDE. AND ONCE AGAIN COMMITTING OURSELVES TO NEVER LETTING THIS HAPPEN AGAIN. WE KNOW SO MANY WHO HAVE SUFFERED THIS FORM OF GENOCIDE. THIS ATTACK ON A INDIVIDUALS THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE IN THIS NATION. THE OTHER DAY I WAS READING AN ARTICLE IN THE UNION TRIBUNE AS WE WERE CELEBRATING. A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS I GUESS IT IS FOR THE ECONOMY AYE INDIANS AND THEIR CONTACT WITH AMERICANS -- WHO CAME HERE AND IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY TALKED ABOUT THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT THE THOUGHT WAS THAT THEY WOULD JUST SIMPLY X. -- EXTERMINATE THE COMEY AYE INDIANS. AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT BUT THEY HAD BASICALLY REDUCE THEIR NUMBERS DOWN TO VERY SMALL NUMBERS. AND PUT THEM INTO PLACES THAT WE NOW CALL RESERVATIONS IN AREAS THAT ARE ALMOST DESOLATE WITH REGARDS THE ABILITY TO GROW CROPS. AND THE THOUGHT WAS A WILL JUST EXTERMINATE THEM AND WE'LL JUST MOVE ON BECAUSE THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY NOT USEFUL TO THEM ANYMORE ONCE THEY HAD NURTURED THEM BACK TO HEALTH. BECAUSE THOSE WHO WAS THE SPANIARD TO CAME HERE WERE ILL WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN THIS COUNTRY IN THIS COUNTRY AND SO THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD EXTERMINATE THE INDIANS A CALL ME I BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING MUCH MORE POWERFUL IN THEM THE COSTUME TO SURVIVE AND TO LIVE. WE KNOW OF THE MILLIONS WHO DIED IN THE MIDDLE PASSAGE COMING FROM AFRICA TO THE UNITED STATES. THAT OFTENTIMES OVER 50% OF THE CARGO WAS THROWN OVERBOARD OF PEOPLE COMMITTED SORT OUT SUICIDE IT DIDN'T SURVIVE THE MIDDLE PASSAGE TO COME HERE. AND AFTER THAT STILL THE KIND OF DEGRADATION THAT OCCUR TO TAKE AWAY THEIR IDENTITY THE TAKE AWAY THE SENSE OF PURPOSE AND FOCUS AND SO WE'VE SEEN THIS COUNTRY BASICALLY PARTICIPATE IN THIS WHOLE ISSUE. OF GENOCIDE IN VARIOUS WAYS AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS AROUND THE WORLD WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A DEVASTATING EXPERIENCE. A LASTING EXPERIENCE THAT NOT ONLY OF IMPACTS THE FOLKS AT THAT MOMENT BUT FOR GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS TO COME. IT IS SO IMPERATIVE THAT WE TALK ABOUT OUR HISTORY IT IS STRONG THIS FORM SO THE WE TALK ABOUT THE COURAGE OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED WHO WERE DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN THEIR SENSE OF HUMANITY. AND NOT BE VICIOUS IN THE PROCESS BUT ALSO TO MAINTAIN THEIR CULTURE AND TO ACTUALLY GROW AND DEVELOP FROM WHAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED. IT IS -- INTERESTING AS WE STAND HERE TODAY THAT WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND WE ARE FACED WITH SO MANY HATE CRIMES AND SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO IGNORE THE TAPPED ON INDIVIDUALS. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IN MY FAMILY THE BURNING OF THE OF THE CHURCH IN IN PARIS AND SOMEONE SAID TO ME BUT WHAT ABOUT THE THREE BLACK CHURCHES THAT WERE BURNED IN THE UNITED STATES DOING ONE WEEKEND. I MEAN THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THAT ARE HERE WITH US AT THIS MOMENT. AND IF WE DON'T THEN WE ARE NO BETTER THAN THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE IN THE GENOCIDE THEMSELVES BECAUSE WERE TURNING OUT I AWAY FROM THE SMALL THINGS BUT THEY'RE REALLY VERY LARGE THINGS AND VERY SYMPTOMATIC OF A NATION. THAT REFUSES TO DEAL WITH ITS HISTORY. AND ITS PRESENT AND THEREFORE OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE CONTINUED TO DAMAGE THE FUTURE. I'VE SAID ON THIS FOR MANY MANY TIMES AND WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT WE MUST CONTINUE TO WATCH ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE A TENDENCY TO DESTROY US. AND OUR HUMANITY AND OUR SENSE OF DEMOCRACY IN FAIRNESS AND pTHAT HATRED AND INCLUSION IN THIS NATION IS LIKE A RARE FLOWER THAT HAS TO BE CONSTANTLY REMEMBERED AND NURTURED AND CARED. FOR BUT HATRED IS A WEEK. DISCRIMINATION IS A WEEK AND A GROWS BEST IN THE COLLECT AND WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE'RE NOT NEGLECTING WHAT WE SEE THAT WE ROOTED OUT AND WE CONTINUE TO GROW THAT WHICH IS WONDERFUL. I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THIS RESOLUTION AND THE BLACK CAUCUS STRONGLY SUPPORTS AG ARE SIXTEEN AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL VOTE FOR IT. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE. AS I HAVE. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION -- BECAUSE I BELIEVE AS I'VE SAID BEFORE THAT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST THAT WE CONTINUE TO CALL IT WHAT IT IS? THAT WE CALL THIS THE GENOCIDE. THAT WE THAT WE TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE AND THAT WE REMEMBER. THESE THINGS ANNA AND I THINK AS AS HAS BEEN SPOKEN ON THIS FOR A LITTLE BIT THIS MORNING IS. IS THAT WE LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. OVER THE OVER THE WEEKEND. ON SUNDAY MORNING -- CELEBRATING EASTER WITH MY FAMILY AT OUR CHURCH AND GETTING THE NEWS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN SRI LANKA. WHERE THREE HUNDRED OVER THREE HUNDRED OTHER CHRISTIANS WERE? MURDERED AS THEY WORST. PRACTICING THEIR FAITH JUST LIKE. ME AND MY FAMILY WERE. THAT MORNING AS WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED IN CHARLESTON IN PITTSBURGH. IN NEW ZEALAND. AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN. RIGHT HERE IN THE PRESENT AGE. IN OUR PRESENT ERA. WHERE ARE FOR WHATEVER REASON PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE THIS? THE WORDS EVEN THE WORDS THAT PEOPLE ARE USING TO DE HUMANIZE WHERE YOU CAN DE HUMANIZE SOMEONE AS THE ENEMY. WE START TO EVEN TALK ABOUT OURSELVES EVEN AS AMERICANS TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE AS AN ENEMY. RATHER THAN SOMEONE THAT MAY WE JUST HAVE A DISAGREEMENT WITH. AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALLY NEED THIS TO START THINKING ABOUT AS AS LEADERS IN OUR COMMUNITY -- AS PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO CREATE A BETTER WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN -- IS THAT. YEAH WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW WE START TALKING ABOUT EACH OTHER AND HOW. WE START BUILDING UP EACH OTHER -- AND THAT WE DON'T WE STOP THIS YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S REALLY EASY TO GO DOWN A PATH. AND WE SEEN IT THROUGHOUT HISTORY IS REALLY EASY TO GO DOWN A PATH WHERE YOU BEGIN TO DE HUMANIZE A GROUP. AND IT GETS TO A POINT WHERE WE'VE WHERE YOU'VE SEEN THE ATROCITIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED. AND WE NEED TO CALL OUT EVIL WHEREVER IT EXISTS. WHEN WE SEE THAT EVIL WHEN WE SEE THE STARTING IS IN THE IN THE CALLS? IT'S IT'S NOT ALL THAT SUBTLE. WE HAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE CALLING FOR THE DEATHS OF CERTAIN GROUPS. THIS CANNOT BE ALLOWED WE CAN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF DIALOGUE WE CAN ALLOW OUR DIALOGUE TO CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH. AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TODAY THAT WE THAT WE REMEMBER. THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WHAT LED UP TO IT. HOW IT GOT TO THAT POINT? HOW EVEN TODAY? THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT DENIES. WHAT IT IS DONE? AND HOW IT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT IN THE LIGHT JUST LIKE SO MANY OTHER THINGS NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT. AND THEN WE NEED TO LOOK BACK AT OURSELVES AND LOOK IN THE MIRROR. AND SAY HEY HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A DIALOGUE. WE CAN DISAGREE ON THINGS WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION DIFFERENT [inaudible] RELIGIONS -- BUT WE NEED TO ALSO AT THE TIME AT THE SAME TIME LEARN TO LIVE WITH EACH OTHER. AND HAVE A RESPECTFUL AND A CIVIL DIALOGUE AND I WORRY ABOUT THAT. AS IT CONTINUES TO DENIGRATE. NOW IN OUR COUNTRY BUT THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THAT WE TRY TO LIFT THAT BACK UP. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE OUR NATION HAS BEEN A BEACON OF LIGHT. AS BEING THAT. THAT NATION THAT CAN LIFT UP THE DIALOGUE THAT CAN LIFT UP. TO THE HIGHEST IDEALS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. AND SO I RISE WITH MY MY COLLEAGUES TODAY SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND TO SUPPORT. THAT KIND OF HIGHER DIALOGUE THAT KIND OF HIGHER SPIRIT THAT WE IN THIS NATION WILL CONTINUE TO LEAVE THANK YOU. THEY GIVE US GALLAGHER. MISTER NAZARIAN YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER OF FIRST AND FOREMOST I LIKE. TO OF COMMAND AND OF SAY HOW MUCH HOW APPRECIATIVE I AM OF OF MY COLLEAGUE -- REPRESENTS SUN VALLEY TO BRING THIS A MEASURE FORWARD. SHE UNDERSTANDS WELL THIS ISSUE BECAUSE SHE REPRESENTS MANY ARMENIAN AMERICANS -- SO I STAND IN SUPPORT OF AG ARE -- SIXTEEN I ALSO WANT TO JUST. SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SPOKEN AS THE RESIDENT ARMENIAN AMERICAN CALIFORNIAN -- WHO HAS THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING -- A VOICE THAT HAS UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO GEOPOLITICS AND HISTORICAL RESOURCE FIGHTS BEEN UNDER HEARD AND NOT RECEIVED IT'S DUE RECOGNITION. UP. LIKE TO THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR RESOUNDING SUPPORT AND FOR ALWAYS. KEEPING THIS VOICE HEARD -- I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHULA VISTA WHO NOT ONLY EVERY YEAR GIVES AN IMPASSIONED SPEECH. BUT ALSO THE REFERENCES THAT SHE HAS MADE -- I OFTEN WONDER ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF ARMENIANS VERSUS AFRICAN AMERICAN SLAVES -- WHILE BOTH ARE TRAGIC. I SOMETIMES FEEL. AS ARMENIANS WE WERE THERE WAS AN EFFORT TO ERADICATE. BUT THOSE OF US WHO SURVIVED STILL NO WHERE OUR LANDS ARE. STILL NO WHERE WE COME FROM STILL NO. AS YOU WILL SEE THERE IS A BOOK ON ALL OF YOUR DESKS. THERE'S FIGHTS OVER SEND SPENDING OVER CENTURIES OF WHAT PAGES OF WHAT MANUSCRIPTS WERE STOLEN. AND FOR WHAT. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT WAS SOLD TO WITH THIS MUSEUM WHERE THAT MUSEUM AND NOW THEY'RE ALL BEING WEEK. RECOLLECTED AND BEING PUT INTO BACK INTO ONE ONE PLACE. SO THERE IS A CON CONTINUATION. TO THE HISTORY. THROUGH THE FACT THAT WE SURVIVED. AND WE WERE ABLE. TO LAKE CLAIM AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT AND PURSUE THAT CLAIM. WHEN I TALK TO MY AFRICAN AMERICAN FRIENDS AND THIS IS GOING BACK TO THE TIME WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER? AND TRY TAKES ASK WILL DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR FAMILY CAME FROM INITIALLY. AND TO HAVE THAT FAMILIAR OLD. BOND NOT BEING ABLE TO BE STRETCHED BEYOND JUST YOUR GRANDPARENTS GENERATION. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE NEVER FELT. I'VE NEVER KNOWN HOW HARD THAT IS. TO HAVE A TO HAVE A LINE. COMPLETELY BROKEN AND NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU'RE FROM. AND WHEN WE SWEEP ISSUES LIKE THIS UNDER THE CARPET. WHICH IS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF A COUPLE OF THINGS COLLEAGUES LET'S BE HONEST. IS SHE POLITICS ITS OIL. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. TO THIS DAY. THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT WILL [inaudible] DEMOLISH. OR BREAK A PART. TAKE DOWN CROSSES. DESTROY ANY TYPE OF CULTURAL ARTIFACTS ON ITS LAND. AND THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN AND ITS OWN FOOTAGE. IT'S YOU CAN SEE IT ON YOU. TO TO THIS DAY. THAT DESTRUCTION HAPPENS IN ORDER TO REVISE HISTORY TO SAY THAT THIS ANGEL PEOPLE ANCIENT PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE FOR FIVE THOUSAND YEARS. REALLY WAS NOT THERE IT'S ALL. FICTION. THIS IS HAPPENING. IN OUR LIFETIMES. THIS IS HAPPENING WHILE WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE CAPABILITY TO SEE WHAT'S WHAT AND WHERE EVERYTHING IS. AND IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW SO YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE. WHAT THE MONTH OF APRIL TO ME FEELS LIKE BECAUSE IT'S THIS TREMENDOUS WEIGHT? EVERY TIME MARCH ENDS AND APRIL BEGINS. AND IRONICALLY APRIL IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MONTH OF REBIRTH. IT SUPPORT WE JUST CELEBRATED NOR IS LESS THAN A MONTH AGO. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE TIME THAT. LIFE IS BLOOMING AND REGENERATING [inaudible] AND YET. TWO WEEKS AGO WE RECOGNIZE THE CAMBODIAN GENOCIDE. NEXT WEEK WE'RE GONNA BE RECOGNIZING THE JEWISH HOLOCAUST. AT SOME POINT WE WILL BE ALSO. MAKING SURE EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN SPOKEN WORDS IN ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR COMMENTS THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE WAS ALSO IN APRIL. ALONG WITH THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. IT. EVERYONE OF THEM HAVE HAPPENED IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT. IN ONE CASE. ONE WAS KILLED ON THEIR OWN LAND IN ANOTHER CASE. ONE MAD MEN WENT AROUND ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES AND MADE SURE ALL THE DIE ASPIRIN COMMUNITIES WERE KILLED IN ANOTHER. THE ONLY REGION KILLED ITS OWN PEOPLE IN ANOTHER AREA TWO TRIBES THAT HAVE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER FOR CENTURIES. WE'RE COMMITTING THE ATROCIOUS HORRIFIC ACTIVITIES WITH AGAINST ONE ANOTHER -- AND UNFORTUNATELY HERE ON OUR OWN LAND. WE STILL YET. TO A DRESS APPROPRIATELY WHAT IS HAPPENED. TO THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF THE UNITED STATES. BEFORE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS ESTABLISHED SO -- I I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR STANDING. UP I I JUST WANT TO MAKE. THERE ARE TWO PROFOUND COMMENTS THE STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OVER TIME THAT I THINK SPEAK VERY WELL TO THIS ISSUE. ONE IS THAT I I CAN'T HELP BUT TO REMEMBER THE POINT WORDS OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING WHEN YOU SO ACCURATELY STATED IN THE END. WE WILL REMEMBER NOT THE WORDS OF OUR ENEMIES BUT THE SILENCE OF OUR FRIENDS. AND THAT AN INJUSTICE IN ONE PLACE IS AN INJUSTICE EVERYWHERE. RAISING THE SECOND. ONE BUT THE OTHER ONE FROM PHILOSOPHER AND WRITER MILAN KUNDERA. THE STRUGGLE OF MAN AGAINST POWER IS THE STRUGGLE OF MEMORY AGAINST FORGETTING. ALL OF US HERE IN THIS CHAMBERS KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED. BECAUSE OF OUR POSITIONS WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPOSURE. BUT MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS. LIVING IN THE FIFTY LARGEST ECONOMY OF THE WORLD THAT HAS THE BENEFITS AND THE RICHES. OF INFORMATION AT THEIR FINGERTIPS. STILL DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THESE ISSUES. AND THE LONGER THEY GO ON NOT KNOWING. THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY WHAT ALLOWS. HORRIFIC ACTIVITIES TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY DID. IF WE DON'T TAKE STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE PAID THE PRICE. FOR THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY COMMITTED THE HORRORS THAT THEY COMMITTED. IN THIS CASE WHEN MY COLLEAGUE FROM ENCINO SPOKE ABOUT THE FLAGS BEING PUT UP. MANY OF US EVEN HERE WOULD SAY. WHY DOES A FLAG IGNITE SUCH HORRIFIC MEMORIES [inaudible] COLLEAGUES. WHEN HITLER TOOK OVER GERMANY HE CHANGED THE FLAG? AND PUT THE SWASTIKA ON THE FLAG. WHEN HITLER FELL? THE FLAG WENT AWAY. SYMBOLIZING THAT THE REGIME. IS GONE. WE WILL NEVER TRY TO BRING THAT BACK AGAIN. THE TURKISH REPUBLICS FLAG. IS STILL THE SAME. FROM PHOTOS YOU CAN EVEN LOOK AT WHEN THEY WOULD MASS HANG. COMMUNITY LEADERS IN TOWNS AND CITIES IN ARMENIA. HISTORIC LANDS OF ARMENIA. AND YET THE CLAIM THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED THE SYMBOLS HAVE CHANGED. AND THAT THEY ARE REFORMED AND THAT WAS IN THE PAST. IF WE LET THE PAST CONTINUE TO NOT BE RESOLVED. AND TO CONTINUE TO HAUNT -- IT'LL ONLY IMPACT THIS GOING INTO THE FUTURE AND WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES IN FACT.

AB ONE SEVENTY IS INSPIRED BY THE STORY OF XANDER PESCARA. A HOTEL WORKER WHO WAS WASHING DISHES AND WAS HARASSED BY HER SUPERVISOR. WHEN SHE WENT ABOVE HER SUPERVISOR TO THE HOTEL MANAGER? HE BASICALLY TOLD HER IT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE NEITHER OF THOSE WORKERS ACTUALLY WORK FOR THE HOTEL. THEY WERE SUBCONTRACTED OUT DESPITE WORKING ON THE GROUNDS OF THE HOTEL IN DOING THE PRIMARY WORK OF THE HOTEL. THE TREND WE'VE SEEN ESPECIALLY IN JANITORIAL HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING SERVICES HAS BEEN TOWARD OUTSOURCING WORK TO STAFFING AGENCIES. THESE WORKERS MAY GO TO WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY AT THE SAME LOCATION WEARING THE SAME UNIFORM OF THE OFFICER HOTEL THEIR CLEAN IT REPORTING TO MANAGERS ON SITE. YET IF THEY'RE SEXUALLY HARASSED THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO GO. WORKERS IN MANY CASES ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THE SUB CONTRACTING AGENCY OR WHO THEIR ACTUAL DIRECT SUPERVISOR IS. THESE CONTRACTING COMPANIES AND HOTELS ARE NOT HELD RESPONSIBLE ONE SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAPPENS ON THEIR WATCH TO THEIR WORKERS. WHAT IS RESULTED FROM THIS LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY ARE MORE STORIES OF ABUSES IN THE WORKPLACE PERPETRATED BY THE SAME ACTORS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN? COLLEAGUES LAST YEAR WE DID A LOT TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO ISSUES AND WE HELPED A LOT OF WOMEN WOMEN WHO. YOU KNOW MIGHT HAVE A LAW DEGREE MIGHT WORK IN HOLLYWOOD OR IN THE HALLS OF THIS CHAMBER BUT WHAT WE DIDN'T ADDRESS IS WOMEN WHO WORK IN MY DISTRICT AT HOTELS. AND JANITORIAL COMPANIES AND BLUE COLLAR JOBS THAT SOMETIMES DON'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF RELATIONSHIP AT AT THE WORKPLACE THAT WE WOULD HAVE IN A TRADITIONAL ONE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO SEEK SOME SORT OF RECOURSE. LAST YEAR WE BROUGHT FOR THE BILL MANY OF YOU VOTED ON THAT BILL AND UNFORTUNATELY WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR SO WE'RE TRYING AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE ME TOO MOVEMENT DOES NOT LEAVE BEHIND WORKING CLASS WOMEN AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BUILDS TENDS TO DO.

FIFTY SIX DECLARES APRIL AS LIMB LOSS AWARENESS MONTH. THERE ARE OVER TWO MILLION INDIVIDUALS UNITED STATES LIVING WITH LIMB LOSS IN OVER FIVE HUNDRED AMPUTATIONS OCCUR EVERY DAY. DIABETES AND PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE ARE AMONG THE LEADING CAUSES OF WIN LOSS WITH LIFETIME HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVE LOS EXCEEDING OVER A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. WHEN LOSS CAN AFFECT ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF RACE AGE GENDER? OR SOCIAL STATUS. ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE PROSTHETIC CARE FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH THEM LOS IS VITAL TO ENABLING INDIVIDUALS TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. LIVE INDEPENDENTLY AND LIVE WELL. LIKELY CALIFORNIA HAS ENACTED INSURANCE FAIRNESS LAWS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND INSURANCE POLICIES THAT COVER PROSTHETIC CARE. WHILE TECHNOLOGY IS ADVANCING WHEN IT COMES TO PROSTHETIC LIMBS OBTAINING A PROSTHETIC HAND OR LEG IS STILL A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO THE COST AND THE NILES FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES. STUDIES SHOW UP 260% OF LAMB LOSSES PREVENTABLE THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN EDUCATION NUTRITION AND HEALTH CARE. THE NUMBER OF AMPUTATIONS WILL DOUBLE BY TWENTY FIFTY UNLESS A MAJOR PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN IS LAUNCHED IN KEY PREVENTION INITIATIVES ARE PUT IN PLACE.
