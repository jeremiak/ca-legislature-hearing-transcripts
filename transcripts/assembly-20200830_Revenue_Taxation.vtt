ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON WANT

00:34:50.488 --> 00:34:53.191
TO JUMP IN ONE IS THAT WE FOUND

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:55.126
THAT THERE IS A GREAT NEED

00:34:55.193 --> 00:34:57.562
PRIOR TO THE OF PANDEMIC

00:34:57.628 --> 00:35:02.733
KIDDING ARE THERE WAS 95% OF

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.736
USE THERE USING95% OF THE

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:07.738
INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS OF THE

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:09.574
RECORDING STUDIOS AND THIS

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.843
PERMANENT YOU KNOW-

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:14.412
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE WERE

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:18.783
GETTING READY TO JUST OUT- NOT

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:19.617
BE IN A POSITION TO KEEP

00:35:19.684 --> 00:35:21.452
GROWING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:22.954
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.490
WE'RE GONNA LOSE PRODUCTION

00:35:25.556 --> 00:35:26.591
BECAUSE WE WERE NOT IN A

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:27.892
POSITION TO KEEP IT HERE IN THE

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:30.394
STATE SO IS VERY MUCH GETTING

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:31.629
TO THE POINT WHERE WE COULD

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:32.697
HAVE LOST THOSE JOBS OUT OF

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:35.233
CALIFORNIA SO I KNOW THE

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:37.802
PANDEMICS HIT BUT WE DON'T WANT

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:39.103

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.038
CAN BUILD THIS OVERNIGHT WE

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:42.473
DON'T WANT TO WAIT WE KNOW WE

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.809
HAVE THE ABILITY. TO CREATE FAR

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:46.344
FAR MORE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.812
THROUGH THE ENTERTAINMENT

00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:48.579
INDUSTRY WE WANT TO BE IN A

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:51.516
POSITION TO KEEP CONTINUE TO BE

FOR THE COUNTRY AND YOU KNOW

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:55.620
ONE OF THE CAPITALS OF THE

00:35:55.686 --> 00:35:57.522
WORLD SO WE WANT TO BE IN A

00:35:57.588 --> 00:35:58.890
POSITION TO BE ABLE TO CREATE

00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:01.025

THE BUSINESS PICKS UP FOR US TO

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:06.364
BE ABLE TO ABSORB IT AND- SEOUL

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:10.902
THAT'S ONE REASON I DID NOT-

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:11.536
MISTER DAVIS IF YOU WANT TO ADD

00:36:11.602 --> 00:36:14.939
TO THAT. THANK YOU LAW CENTER.

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:17.074

WANTING TO BE READY FOR-

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:22.179
PRODUCTION ASSEMBLY THAT WE

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:23.381
BELIEVE AND WHAT WAS THAT WOULD

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:26.350
NOT BE COMING BACK. AFTER ON IT

00:36:26.417 --> 00:36:29.186
WE PASSED THIS. THIS THIS

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:32.723
HORRIFIC. UP PANDEMIC THAT

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.291
WE'RE EXPERIENCING. THE PUT

00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:35.393
DOWN MAKE ON THAT THUNDER. WE

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:36.694
ARE AT NEAR CAPACITY THE

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:39.263
INDUSTRY. AND WE HAD UP MORE

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.566
COMPANIES SPEAKING- TO COME

00:36:41.632 --> 00:36:44.435
YOUR DOCTOR COMPACT CALIFORNIA

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:45.903
FROM OTHER STATES. SO IT IS

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:49.006
NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:49.574
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT. OF

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.776
THIS. IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE

00:36:51.842 --> 00:36:53.144
THESE COMPANIES WHO ARE WILLING

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:55.212
TO MAKE THIS TYPE COMMITMENT.

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:59.016
pGROWTH OF TH JOBS IT ALSO

00:36:59.083 --> 00:36:59.650
MAKES A COMMITMENT TO THE

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:02.720
STATE. AND I THINK THAT- THIS

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:05.256
IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT.

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:06.057
ANYTHING THAT THAT THE STATE

00:37:06.123 --> 00:37:08.392
CAN DO. WITH THE DOLLARS THAT

00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:11.195
ARE ALREADY ALLOCATED. IS TO

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.364
HAVE THOSE INVESTED IN SUCH A

00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:16.267
WAY THAT IS GOING TO- COULD NOT

00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:18.202
JUST A PROMISE OF THE JOBS BUT

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:20.137
THE GUARANTEE- IN ORDER TO

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:22.206
FULFILL THE COMMITMENT ORDERS

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:24.842
TO GET THE UP. IF THE SERBS.

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:27.211
THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY CREATE

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:29.680
THE JOB NOT JUST- YOU KNOW SAY

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:31.215
THAT WELL IF WE DO THIS THEN

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:32.483
THE JOBS ARE PROBABLY BE

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.918
CREATED THIS IS AN ACTUAL

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:37.788
COMMITMENT. OVER TIME. IN ON TO

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:40.358
AN INDUSTRY THAT- IS SEARCH

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:42.326
SYNONYMOUS WITH CALIFORNIA. AND

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:46.697
WE BELIEVE. THAT THIS IS GOOD

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:48.733
PUBLIC POLICY. ANY OTHER

00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:50.701
QUESTIONS IDEA BUT I DON'T KNOW

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:52.837
MISTER AT OUR- BURKE CALDERON

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:53.738
IS GONNA THANK AYE PROJECTS

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:54.839
ACTUALLY REALLY GREAT QUESTION

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:55.973
I THINK IT SHOULD BE OPEN TO A

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.408
LOT MORE INDUSTRIES ANYBODY

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:58.075
WHO'S WILLING TO MAKE THIS KIND

00:37:58.142 --> 00:37:59.243
OF INVESTMENT THE STATE. THE

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.478
KIND OF THERE'S TWO ISSUES THAT

00:38:00.544 --> 00:38:02.413
THE FIRST ISSUES IT IS YOU KNOW

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.214
UNDERGO SEASONS OF THE

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.315
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I THINK YEAH

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:05.316
AND THE ADMINISTRATION THIS IS

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:06.417
KIND OF MORE THE FOLKS THAT

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:07.985
THEY WANTED TO BE. WE ALSO HAVE

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:09.654
BEEN TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.389
MAKE OUR TAX CREDITS A LITTLE

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:12.390
BIT MORE USEFUL AS TIME GOES

00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:13.724
ON. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:14.458
IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:16.560
THAT GROWTH- AND THIS IS A

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:17.895
GREAT START TO THAT AND I THINK

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.163
IF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL WE CAN

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.398
EXPAND THAT TO OTHER

00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:21.532
INDUSTRIES. BUT IT'S ALL WAS

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.767
ALSO ASKED OF US BY CAL

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.802
COMPETES THEMSELVES- IF WE

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:26.370
COULD ALSO NARROW AND SPECIFIC

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:27.304
TO THE INDUSTRY GIVEN WHAT

00:38:27.371 --> 00:38:28.305
WE'RE ASKING FOR THE TYPES OF

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:30.074
IN A TYPE OF INVESTMENT ITSELF.

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:31.075
YOU KNOW ORIGINALLY THE

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.643
LANGUAGE WAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:33.611
MORE BROAD BUT THIS IS KIND OF

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:34.445
WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH THROUGH

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:36.514
THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS- BUT I

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.348
CERTAINLY WOULD ENCOURAGE

00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:38.282
ESPECIALLY IF THIS IS

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:39.283
SUCCESSFUL WHICH I BELIEVE WILL

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.319
BE SUCCESSFUL. TO OPEN THAT UP-

00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:44.255
TO OTHER INDUSTRIES AND YOU

00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:44.989
KNOW I JUST THINK THAT WE'RE

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:45.990
GONNA NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:47.425
MODERNIZATION OF OUR TAX CREDIT

00:38:47.491 --> 00:38:49.193
PROGRAMS. TO ALLOW THEM TO BE

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.461
APPLICABLE AND RELEVANT AS WE

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:51.962
MOVE ON TO BE ABLE TO FLY FOR

00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:53.531
BUSINESS IS STATES HERE TO KEEP

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:56.701
THAT- KEEP THAT INVESTMENT.

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:57.401
CONTINUALLY COMING TO

00:38:57.468 --> 00:38:59.470
CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'LL WANT

00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:00.538
THEY WILL WANT TO BE HERE

00:39:00.604 --> 00:39:01.539
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:04.275
EXPENSIVE TO MOVE TO OTHER

00:39:04.341 --> 00:39:04.942
STATES THERE'S HOT THERE'S

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.444
COVERT REST ESPECIALLY WITHIN

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.012
THIS INDUSTRY SO. THIS IS WHAT

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:10.181
THE PRODUCTION OF YOU KNOW ALL

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:11.549
A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS BEING

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:12.850
INVOLVED. IN A VERY VERY SHORT

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:14.485
PERIOD OF TIME BUT THAT'S

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:15.386
ULTIMATELY WHY WE LANDED ON

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:16.287
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITIES

00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:17.555
GONNA BUT IT BRING A LOT OF

00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:18.756
ECONOMIC REVENUE. CERTAINLY

00:39:18.823 --> 00:39:21.192
WORTH DOING RIGHTNOW- AND THEN

00:39:21.258 --> 00:39:26.097
HOPEFULLY. EXPANDING LATER ON.

00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:27.531
DEMOCRATIC I THINK EVERYTHING

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:28.232
EVERYTHING. A CENTER. THAT BUT

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:30.401

IMPORTANT. FOR US TO SUPPORT. A

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.505
REALLY IMPORTANT HISTORY. AND

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:36.173
EVERYTHING THAT. ABDOMINAL THE

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.808
PHONE SAID. TOTALLY AGREE I

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:39.143

WE NEED TO CREATE. WE NEED TO

00:39:46.817 --> 00:39:47.985
CREATE JOBS AND STIMULATE THIS

00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:49.019
ECONOMY NOT JUST IN THE

00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:49.593
UNPRECEDENTED WORLD CRISIS THAT

WE'RE ALL LIVING TO THIS

00:43:50.427 --> 00:43:52.896
ECONOMIC RECESSION THAT EXISTS

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:53.364

LATER AND THERE SHOULD BE

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.538
ANOTHER BILL AND THEN THE OTHER

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:04.775
BILLS COMMON THEY EXPLAIN TO-

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.410

01:02:32.815 --> 01:02:35.184
CREDIT WILL CATCH ONE HIGHLIGHT.

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:37.120
OF THE CREDIT SO FIRST IS THE

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:38.387
PUBLIC SPEECHES THAT HOW THE

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:39.589
QUALIFICATIONS FOR THOSE

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:43.526
CREDITS ARE BASED OFF OF THE

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:44.894
SAME PARAMETERS. A CALL FOR THE

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.629
PROJECT ATTACK CREDIT FOR THE

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:50.333
DROP ARE THE CARE. AND THE CALL

01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:52.335
CAME ARE THE BILL AFTER THAN

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:54.170
HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND THEY ALSO

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:55.905
HAD TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT TO

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:58.941
TALK DECLINE IN REVENUE-

01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:00.143

BUSINESSES. TO DETERMINE

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:07.917
WHETHER THEY QUALIFY FOR THE

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:08.651
HIRING CREDIT. THE SECOND

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:12.021
SECOND POINT IS THAT- THIS WILL

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:13.789

ALL DR KIRK I DON'T YOU'RE MIKE

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:11.867
IS ON THIS TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:13.135

PROJECTIONS IS VERY SHE'S GOING

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:20.843
TO SO MY CONCERN IS THAT THE-

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:22.411
THESE CREDITS BY LARGE DON'T

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:25.247

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:29.985
HAND IS BUSINESSES DO DESERVE-

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:34.557

DO HAVE A HUNDRED ARE LARGER

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.338
MORE SOPHISTICATED AND THE

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:51.073
CONCERN HERE IS THAT IT WOULD

BE THESE. THAT THE MOM AND POP

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:55.745

HELP SOME SMALL BUSINESSES ON

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:09.879
THE MARGIN BUT- I THINK IT'S

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:12.281
SORT OF A SAD COMMENTARY ON-

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:13.849
THE WORK PRODUCT OF THE

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:15.251
LEGISLATURE HER THESE LAST FEW

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:16.585
MONTHS. THIS IS KIND OF WHAT

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:17.887
WE'VE LANDED ON IS THE WAY

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.221
WE'RE GOING TO HELP OUT. SMALL

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:20.689
BUSINESSES A THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.191
TAX CREDIT I MEAN THERE ARE ALL

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:23.092
KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.793
DOING TO SMALL BUSINESSES THAT

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:25.961
WOULD BE WORTH A LOT MORE THAN

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:27.263
A THOUSAND DOLLARS IF WE SIMPLY

01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:29.031
STOP DOING THEM. IN FACT THERE

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:30.032
ARE NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.033
CONSIDERING DOING THEY'RE GONNA

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.435
BE ON THE FLOOR TONIGHT-

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.003
THAT'LL COST THEM A LOT MORE

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:36.739
THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS- SO-

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.807
AGAIN I'LL ALSO PUT THE BILL-

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:40.576

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:48.284

EXACT SAME CRITICISM THAT THAT

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.402
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE BILL AND

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:08.103
I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IT AND IN

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.939
INTO MEDIUM GOING TO VOTE NO.

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:11.073

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:13.576
FLOOR BUT I'M GOING TO CONTINUE

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:16.412
THINKING ABOUT IT. IT IT SEEMS

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:19.081
AS THOUGH THAT. YOU KNOW THIS

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:21.216
IS A MORE OF A PRODUCT. OF THE

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:23.485
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THEN IT

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:26.689
IS A OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:29.592
SEEMS THAT IT'S- GOT A GREAT.

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:32.561
KIND OF A- A CAMPAIGN HE KICK

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:34.229

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:36.131

OF THIS BUT IT'S CHERRY

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:42.504
PICKING. BECAUSE THESE ARE

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.306
