WE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE LIMITED SEATING AVAILABILITY IN THIS ROOM. AND WE WILL BE CAREFULLY MONITORING CAPACITY THROUGHOUT THE HERE- IN. ADDITION TO THE IT LIVE IN PERSON PRESENTATIONS WE WILL RECEIVE THIS AFTER. SOME PANELIST COULD NOT A TENSE. WILL BE JOINED VIA THE- CONFERENCING SO FINALLY I WOULD ASK COLLEAGUES TO PLEASE HOLD ANY. AND TELL END OF EACH PANEL. AND SO WE THAT AGAIN THE- FOR THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS TO HAVE A TO LEARN ABOUT IN FARM. IN CALIFORNIA AND EXPLORE HOW CAN IN OUR STATE'S CLAIM AND THE GOALS. AS WE KNOW TWENTY TWENTY WAS IN ON PRESS YEAR- AND WE CONTINUE TO LIVE IN AND WORK IN VERY CHALLENGING TIMES. AS A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I NOW REPRESENT AGRICULTURE IS AN IMMENSE SOURCE OF PRIDE FOR OUR COMMUNITY FOR MY FAMILY AND FOR MYSELF. OUR DISTRICT THE THIRTY DECEMBER DISTRICT INCLUDES SOME OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL LANDS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD- IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE IN AGRICULTURAL MARVEL. YOU KNOW WE ARE A MODEL FOR OTHER STATES WE ARE A MODEL FOR THE NATION'S AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THROUGHOUT HISTORY CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE HAS PROVEN IT IS BOTH INNOVATIVE AND RESILIENT. AND FOLLOWING MY APPOINTMENT AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE WITH THE CONSIDERATION TOWARDS THE CHALLENGES FACED BY OUR FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS WHEN WE GIVEN THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC I WAS PROUD TO EMBARK ON A TWO MONTH STATEWIDE AGRICULTURAL TOUR. JOINED BY A LOT OF MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE- TO MEET WITH STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND GATHER PERSPECTIVES ON THE NEEDS OF THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. IN NOVEMBER BASED ON STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ON OUR TOUR. WE HELD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRES ON CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE- AND TODAY ALSO BASED ON SITE VISITS AND ENGAGEMENT WELL ON OUR AG TOUR WE ARE HOLDING AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON A VINYL FARMING IN CALIFORNIA. SO I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THE SUCCESS OF BOTH OUR FARMERS AND- FARM WORKERS AND I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE A WORLDWIDE LEADER IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. WHILE ALSO LEADING THE WAY ENVIRONMENTAL AND INNOVATION IN OUR FIELDS. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN AND RECOGNIZED AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER. OUR STATE HAS SOME OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE POLICIES. AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS IN THE COUNTRY. AND IF WE HAVE ANY CHANCE OF MEETING OUR AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS AND MITIGATING THE WORST IMPACTS OF OUR CHANGING CLIMATE. AGRICULTURE MUST. PLAY A ROLE. IT'S OFTEN OVERLOOKED BUT AGRICULTURE ENVIRONMENTAL AND REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE OFFER SOME OF THE MOST PROMISING OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. ACCORDING TO ENVIRONMENTALIST PAUL HAWKEN AGRICULTURE. HOW WE GROW OUR FOOD HOW WE MANAGE OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS. MAY REPRESENT BY FAR THE SINGLE GREATEST SOLUTION. TO OUR CLIMATE CRISIS AS A STATE A LOT OF EMPHASIS HAS BEEN PLACED ON REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS BUT A REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS JUST SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH. YES WE MUST REMAIN STEADFAST IN OUR COMMITMENT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS OF CARBON. IT IS LEADING RESEARCHERS FROM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AGREE. WE MUST PRIORITIZE AND INVEST IN CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND THERE'S NO BETTER MORE EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THIS THAT SUPPORTING AND INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND ENCOURAGING INNOVATION. IF WE CAN PRACTICE AGRICULTURE IN A WAY THAT FIGHTS CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY CREATING A MORE RESILIENT FOOD SYSTEM IN OUR STATE WE MUST MAXIMIZE ALL OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. THERE IS GREAT POTENTIAL TO INNOVATE IN THIS AREA AND AS CHAIR OF THE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE I PLAN TO FOSTER A VIGOROUS DEBATE CALIFORNIA. MUST LEAD THE WAY. AND TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM FARMERS RANCHERS RESEARCHERS AND ADVOCATES ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ENVIRONMENT FARMING. WE'LL HEAR ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE AND THEIR IMPACTS THEIR CHALLENGES- AND ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE ON CURRENT PROGRAMS AND WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO EXPAND ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING PRACTICES. I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION THIS AFTERNOON WELCOME OTHER MEMBERS TO SHARE OPENING REMARKS VICE CHAIR MATHIS. THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN RIVAS- I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TWO MONTH ACT OR UP AND DOWN THE STATE. VERY SIMILAR- THING WHEN I. GOT ONTO THE AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE AND- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU TOOK THAT IN DEPTH- TIME TO GO AND DO THAT- IS HE SAID. OUR AGRICULTURAL EFFORTS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR THE CUTTING EDGE OF AG TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE PROCESS IS DONE. OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS RECYCLE WATER MORE THAN A GREAT MANY PEOPLE REALIZE. THEY RE USE% EVERY POSSIBLE THING THAT THEY CAN. AND THEY ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW TO DO THINGS BETTER AND I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR ROBUST HEARING TODAY TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE. TO READ NOT JUST THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO THE WORLD IN OUR AG TECHNOLOGIES AND LOOK AT HOW OUR AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ARE EXTREMELY ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND. AND WHAT WE CAN DO AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO HELP. KEEP OUR FARMS AND RANCHES CONTINUING TO GO HERE WITHIN THE STATE AND THE THINGS THAT WE CAN BETTER DO. TO GET SOME OF THE RED TAPE OUT OF THEIR WAY SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOOD AND FIBER FOR ALL OF US THANK YOU. THE REST YOUR MATHIS ANY OTHER COMMENTS I WAS THE COMMITTEE. NOT WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR FIRST PANEL THIS IS AN OVERVIEW OF CDFA IS ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING AND INNOVATION PROGRAM. THIS FIRST PANEL- WE ARE HONORED TODAY TO HAVE KAREN ROSS SECRETARY OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. AS YOU'LL BE JOINING US VIRTUALLY- SECRETARY ROSS'S SERVICES TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND MY OPINION IS THE FINEST STATE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY- PRIOR TO OUR SERVICE IN OUR STATE SECRETARY ROSS SERVED AS CHIEF OF STAFF TO U. S. AGRICULTURE SECRETARY TOM VILSACK. WHO WAS A FORMER SECRETARY AND SOON TO BE CURRENT SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE. SHE HAS SPENT HER CAREER FIGHT FINDING INNOVATIVE WAYS FOR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE TO CONTINUE SERVING AS A MODEL FOR THE NATION AND WORLD SO SECRETARY ROSS THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SEVEN TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THE INVITATION. TO YOU AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT MAKES ME SO PASSIONATE ABOUT MY JOB AND THAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO WORK WITH OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS NOT ONLY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY BUT TO SEE WHAT IS AROUND THE BAND AND TO CONTINUE TO INNOVATE AND WEIGHS AROUND. ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET THE FOOD SECURITY NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AS WELL AS CONSUMERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE GLOBE. AND TO DO IT IN A VERY ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND WAY I'M WITH THE COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY I WANT TO TAKE JUST ONE MINUTE AND THE TIME HAS BEEN ALLOTTED TO EACH JUST PROVIDE TO A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE- BEGAN TO PLAY. A ROLE IN THIS SPACE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE I WAS STILL A MEMBER OF THE STATE FORTITUDE IN AGRICULTURE AND WE WERE CHALLENGED- BY OUR CHAIRMAN AT THAT TIME. TO DO A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AGRICULTURE AND SO WE ENDED UP GOING THROUGH. A STATEWIDE LISTENING SESSION TO HEAR ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND- OPPORTUNITIES AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO BE DOING IN THIS TIME OF REALLY RAPID CHANGE- TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATHWAY FOR THE LONG TERM VIABILITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. THAT LED TO ACTIVATION- AND THAT WAS THE FRAMEWORK THAT REALLY HELPED US PRIORITIZE OUR WORK AND THE CLAIM IS BASED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF. AGRICULTURE IT WAS ONE THAT I MONTHS THAT. THAT LEAD OUT WAS THAT WE DO ALL THE WAS PASSED. TO ASSURE AFTER. ADDED I'M CHANGE I WAS JUST THE- BECAUSE AT THAT TIME THE REPORT WAS RELEASED IN TWENTY TWO. I DID. PROBABLY SPEAKING WE'RE FAR ON ADAPTATION. BUT NOW WE UNDERSTAND THE. HUGE POWER. AGRICULTURE TO DRIVE DOWN. SEQUESTERED IN OUR SOIL. AND MEDICARE. CLIMATE CHANGE THAT'S THE A REMARK- DEVELOPED IN THE GLOBAL. AND ONE HAS TO. MOMENTUM BEHIND AT. IN TWENTY TWELVE WE OR- THE KIND CHANGE SOURCE. THIS WAS FUNDED BY A SPECIAL CROP BLOCK. THAT WE USE TO CONVEY A CROSSWORD. FROM ACROSS THE STATE. TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW MAY TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE HOW ARE THEY THINKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND HOW DID ADAPTATION FACTOR INTO THEIR DAILY DECISION MAKING. IT WAS A VERY INFORMATIVE PROCESS IT WAS GROUNDED IN A SHARED SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF NOT ONLY HOW OUR SPECIALTY CROPS IN PARTICULAR. ARE IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE BUT ALSO WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES WERE FOR US TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND IT OUTLINED IN A VERY CLEAR WAY AND IT'S STILL VERY RELEVANT TAPER RESEARCH COMMUNITY. WHAT WERE SOME OF THE TOOLS WHAT WAS ON THE TECHNOLOGY PEOPLE ARE HOPEFUL ABOUT AND WE'RE THEIR RESEARCH CAPS TO HELP THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE THE POWERHOUSE OF AGRICULTURE. THEY ARE SH. WE HAVE STATED THAT THE COUPLE TIMES- INCLUDING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND JUST IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WE WORKED WITH A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL CONSORTIUM. TO REALLY FOCUS ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ISSUES OUT OF THAT MAP FOR. ONE OF AND OF THE BECAUSE I. THAT HYPER. WHICH IS AS THIS. OR WHAT ARE TO MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE WITH THE NEED TO AS- ROBERT DOT OF TECHNOLOGY. AND PRODUCTS. FOR HIM. WATER WHICH COULDN'T INCLUDE THE USE OF WATER. SO MOISTURE SENSORS ON FARM WATER STORAGE AND GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WHEREVER THAT'S POSSIBLE- IS LIKE WE ARE BEING TO FUTURISTIC JUST TWO SHORT YEARS LATER TWENTY FOURTEEN WE WERE IN THE BEGINNING OF A DROUGHT WE HAD NO IDEA HOW DO YOU CAN HELP PROLONG. DROUGHT REPEAT. BUT BEYOND THAT OF TWO FOUR. WE THAT THERE IF. CLIMATE SMART PRO- AND IT'S THE STATE WATER EFFICIENCY. PROGRAM FIRST WEEK PROGRAM STOCKHOLDERS PROGRAM IT WAS THE FIRST ONE FOR AGRICULTURE THAT FUNDED AND INCENTIVE- TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND TO IMPROVE WATER USE EFFICIENCY. I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT STILL ONE OF OUR MOST POPULAR PROGRAMS- IT HAS BEEN OVER SUBSCRIBED EVERY YEAR THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO OFFER THAT PROGRAM BY AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. AND I'M ALSO PLEASED BY THE NUMBER OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS WHICH HELPS US LEVERAGE LEVERAGE THESE. TO THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT POSSIBLE. THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE PROGRAM WERE FUNDED BY THE CLIMATE CHANGE INVESTMENT FUND- WE DID RECEIVE SPENDING TWO YEARS AGO FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND THEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THAT WAS PROPOSED IN JANUARY THERE'S A TOTAL OF FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. ON THE GENERAL FUND ONE TIME EXPENDITURE TO CONTINUE. THIS VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM. I WOULD I AM PLEASED TO SAY WE'VE INVEST EIGHTY SEVEN A HALF MILLION. IN PRIOR. WE HAVE FUNDED EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT WE PRIDE THROUGHOUT STATE. THE COVER OVER HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND EIGHT. AND THEY HAVE. OVER EIGHT. THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF CO TWO WEEKS. WE HAVE GAS OVER TEN YEAR WHICH IS HOW WE STRUCK. IT ALSO IS BEING. TO READ OUR WHAT USED BY SO. AND A HALF BILLION GALA. AND I WAS LOVE IT WHEN COMES UP WITH THESE THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF A PROXY SO THOUSAND OLYMPIANS. WALLS THERE IS A PRODUCT- AND AS A RESULT OF THAT AND ARE. WITH U. S. NATURAL RESOURCE CUTS SERVICE TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE TECHNICAL STATE THEY- OR FAR CONSERVE PRACTICES. WE ESTABLISHED OFFICE AND BY FARMING AND IN. RECALLING FOR START- TO ADMINISTER I MISSED AGRICULTURAL. THAT ARE ALL HELP OUR OFFICE THANK ON. AND ANALYSIS. AND HAS A STAFF. FOR ALL OF OUR WORK ACROSS. ON FILE- A RESULT OF THE COULD. AT THE CAPITOL PRO. I'M TO TALK TO PUT THAT ARE. TO REDUCE NOTHING BUT Mí OUR DURING HER RESEARCH DEVELOP PROGRAM. AND THEY'LL TO OR MANAGE PROGRAM WHICH AS WE KNOW MATH IS A IT LOOKS POLLUTANT IS A POWERFUL GREENHOUSE GAS. AND WITH AS A STAY THAT'S ONE STATE NATH NOSES VERY WELL- WITH. EMISSIONS DEFEAT JERRY DIGESTIVE PROGRAM DEPLOYS THE TECHNOLOGY TO CAPTURE THE METHANE WHICH BECOMES A RENEWABLE SOURCE FOR ELECTRICAL GENERATION AND TRANSPORTATION FUELS WHICH QUALIFY UNDER THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH CURRENTLY WE HAVE A HUNDRED IN NINETEEN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. IN PLACE ALREADY ONLINE- THE JERRY FAMILIES LOVE THIS PROGRAM A LOT IN A STEP OVER SUBSCRIBED JUST LAST YEAR BY FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. IT'S ALLOCATED ALMOST TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. THE TERRY FAMILIES THEMSELVES IN THE JERRY DIGEST OR DEVELOPERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN MATCHING FUNDS- I WOULD SAY IT'S. VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. THE ALTERNATE THE NORMALISED PROGRAM REALLY DEALS FOR SMALL AND MID SIZED FAMILIES AND THEIR HERDS. HOW TO BETTER MANAGE DRIVING OR WE'VE GOT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN OF THOSE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND TOGETHER WITH THE DERRY DIGESTIVE PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES BY TWO POINT THREE MILLION METRIC TONS PER YEAR THAT'S A PRETTY REMARKABLE AND WHAT THE L. A. L. LET'S REFER TO AS A VERY EFFICIENT INVESTMENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE DOLLARS. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF REMOVING HALF A MILLION CARS FROM OUR ROADS SO IT'S QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT PROGRAM WHICH HAS TWO VERY IMPORTANT ADDED BENEFITS ONE IS RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE AND TWO IS THE PROVEN REDUCTION ODORS. FROM FROM JERRY SO IT'S BEEN VERY VERY POPULAR IN THE COMMUNITY LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROGRAMS IS ARE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM WHICH HAS BOTH AND INCENTIVES FOR FARMERS. AS WELL. AS A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. IS I'M IN THE FINANCIAL FOR THAT WILL WELL PARTNER WITH OUR GROWERS AND WITH OUR RANCHERS TO IMPLEMENT CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AGAIN THAT ARE BASED ON AN R. C. ASK SCIENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT ARE PROVEN TO WORK WELL FOR THE FARMER AND FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THEY APPROVE STYLE HEALTH THE SEQUESTER CARBON AND THEY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS DESIGNED TO SHOWCASE FOR ALL SO THAT GROUPS OF FARMERS WHO ARE NOT YET READY TO GO DOWN THAT PATHWAY CAN VISIT THOSE SITES LEARN FROM THE SITE IN A NUMBER OF THEM ARE COLLECTING THE DATA WHICH WILL HELP US. UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN DO TO DANCE EVEN MORE OF THESE TYPES ACTRESS WE CURRENTLY HAVE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY INCENTIVE PROJECTS AND SIXTY SIX DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS COVERING A TOTAL OF THIS IS ALSO PART OF OUR WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO HEALTHY CELLS IN ITS JOB WHICH IS WORKING ACROSS EVERY AGENCY THAT MAY HAVE PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE ADAPTED TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THESE TYPES OF PRACTICES PARKS BRANCHES AS WELL AS ADOPTING SMALL HEALTH PRACTICES UNSTABLE PROPERTIES. AND LANDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SH I'M HEALTHY SO PRO- HAS BEEN BY. ARTIST ITS FOR TOO WE DO SPEAK GAS BY OVER A TWELVE DOLLARS. METRIC TONS PER YEAR HE AND ONE OF THIS. THAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS NOT ONLY STORE ALL HEALTH FOR LONG TERM PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES AND FOOD SECURITY BUT ALSO THE WATER HOLDING CAPACITY THAT IS THE RESULT OF INCREASING SOIL ORGANIC MATTER AND HOLDING BACK CARBON IN OUR SOILS. IMPROVE NUTRIENT CYCLING AS A WAY TO PROTECT OUR GROUNDWATER BASINS FROM THE LEACHING OF NITRATES HELLO THE RESULTS- AND- OF COURSE WATER HOLDING CAPACITY FOR STATE THAT CALIFORNIA'S. ABOUT DIVERSITY WE KNOW THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR POWER DIVERSITY IT'S LITERALLY THAT MICROBIAL. ACTIVITY IN OUR SOILS. BOB WHAT OF THE IMPORTANT. IN IT TO FACING PRACTICE ON. AS A VOLUNTARY PRACTICES. YES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND UNDER THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO THIRTY THREE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. WHO PROVIDE GRANT APPLICATION EXPERTISE TO HELP FARMERS A QUIET FOR OUR PROGRAMS INTO THEIR PROGRESS REPORTING. IT ALSO INCLUDES. UNITY EDUCATION SPECIALIST I'M A SMART AGRICULTURE TO HELP ADVANCE THE INFORMATION AND BRING MORE AND MORE FARMERS AND RANCHERS INTO THE PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW CAN HELP US WITH OUR CHALLENGE. UP ARE OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON SMALL FARMS. SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS. AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR US AMONG THE PEOPLE WE COLLABORATE WITH ON THAT IN ADDITION TO NRC ASK OUR RESOURCE CONSERVAION DISTRICTS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. COUNTY FARM BUREAU'S HELP THEIR MEMBERS I'D FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS- AND OTHER PEOPLE IN ACADEMIA AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND CDFA IS PART OF THE FARM DEMONSTRATION NETWORK THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT DANCING THESE KINDS OF PRACTICES WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS. INTERPOSING I WANT TO NOTE THAT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY AGENCY THAT HAS PROGRAMS TO ASSIST AGRICULTURE IN BEATING OUR GOALS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE STATE OUR PARTNER PROGRAMS IN APPROPRIATIONS TO DATE. ARE THE AGRICULTURAL REPLACEMENT MEASURES FOR ADMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THE FARMER PROGRAM WHICH IS HOUSED AT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD I'M WHICH HAS INVESTED STUCK FOR THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. WHERE WE GET MEDIAN BENEFIT OF REDUCING CRITERIA POLLUTANTS BY CLEANER EQUIPMENT AND CLEANER BURNING ENGINES BUT ALSO LONGER TERM REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT PROGRAM. THIS IS A NOVEL ACT LANDS CONSERVATION PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED BY THE STRATEGIC COUNCIL TO DATE THAT'S A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN PRESERVING FARM AND RANCH LAND WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST. EFFICIENT WAYS OF AVOIDING THE EMISSION OF GREENHOUSE GASES WHEN WE DO DEVELOPMENT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MUCH HIGHER THIS IS A FREE HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AS OPPOSED TO KEEPING THAT LAND OUR CULTURE. OF THAT CALIFORNIA CAN- HASN'T A HUNDRED SEVENTY POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. PRODUCTION GRAMS SB AS FOUR POINT ONE MILLION IN ENERGY AGRICULTURE. TODAY TO OUR CLIMATE AND DOES PLAN OVER BILLION DOLLARS BEEN INVESTED IN HELPING AGRICULTURE HELP THIS STATE. ARE CARBON. ALL I'M HAPPY TO GET INTO HOW WE DO THAT THE CASE METHODOLOGY AND THE COMMON FARM TOOL THAT I THINK I'VE USED UP ALL MY TIME AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST I'M THRILLED THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY. QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION SECRETARY ROSS AND YOUR PARTICIPATION OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS. I SHERMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SECRETARY ROSS ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU- JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON A COUPLE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING OVER THE YEARS- WHEN IT COMES TO THE DAIRY METHANE CAPTURED IN THE CARB CREDITS. I KNOW THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT- RENEWABLE GAS BEING SENT INTO THE GAS PIPELINES IN A LOSS OF IT THAT GOING TO VEHICLE FUELS- KNOWING THAT IF THAT GOES INTO- PIPELINES THEN THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE COST OF MANUFACTURERS- IN THOSE THINGS AND WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THOSE CARBON CREDITS- MAKING THE PROGRAM WORK. SO WHAT WHAT IS THE CONVERSATION WITH THE AIRPORT RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS KEEPING THOSE CREDITS TO GO TOWARDS. VEHICLE FUELS AND THEN MAINTAINING. THIS RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS- MODEL TO GO TOWARDS SAY LOCAL FLEETS WITH TRANSPORTATION. THERE'S A LOT OF MOVEMENT AROUND THAT SPACE- THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU AND I HAVE ONE MORE. THE EASY ONE FIRST AND THIS IS PART OF A MUCH LARGER CONVERSATION ACROSS THE DISTRICT. COSTED MINISTRATION- AND ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAIR AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD I'M SURE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT ALL OF THESE PROJECTS THAT GOT THROUGH TO YOU SEE THAT PIPELINE INJECTION SO THAT THE SAFETY. CAN BE ASSURED- I KNOW THAT THE DAIRY SECTOR IS VERY INTERESTED IN BEING A PART OF HOW POWER AND ALL THOSE DIESEL TRUCKS THAT GO UP AND DOWN NINETY NINE IT I FIVE MINUTES TAKE THE BASENESS. THIS IS PART OF A LARGER DISCUSSION THAT WE ARE HAVING AROUND THE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR DAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS BUT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE FOR THE LONG TERM ECONOMICS OF HOW THESE THINGS WORK IF THERE NEEDS TO BE IT. HOW DO WE AVOID DISRUPTION WITH THE PROGRAM THAT'S THAT'S WORKING SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE TERRY FARMERS FOR THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND IMPROVE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON JERRY FARMS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. WHICH ARE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TO THAT ON TUESDAY ESPECIALLY OUT OF RESPECT FOR MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CHAIR AT THE AIRPORT THANK YOU. ARE ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND- SPECIALLY WITH WITH THE NEW CHAIR ON THE AIRPORT- I'VE HAD SEVERAL STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS- LOCALLY RACHAEL IN THE DISTRICTS SINCE WE ARE THE LARGEST. DAIRY AND GO OVER ONE OF THE LARGEST TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS AS WELL. YES I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORTS TO LOOK AT LOCAL FLEETS GOING TOWARDS- NATURAL GAS IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING- SO IF YOU COULD LOOK ME IN WAIT WITH THAT NIGHT MORE THAN HAPPY TO BRING STAKEHOLDERS IN AS WELL. AS LOOK FOR A- LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION- ANOTHER ONE. RELATED WITH- YOU'D MENTION THE- FORMER PROGRAM AND THIS IS WE HAVE DISCUSSED- BACK WHEN WE'RE- CAP AND TRADE TO FIX SOME OF THE KINKS. AS FAR AS UPGRADING ENGINE TYPES. BECAUSE AT THE TIME YOU WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO- SWITCH ENGINE TYPE SO WE WERE GIVEN THE PROGRAM WHERE YOU COULD GO FROM THE OLD DIESEL TO A NEW DIESEL OR NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS- BUT NOT SWITCH SAY FROM DIESEL TO SOLAR. AND I JUST WANNA TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT AND SEE IF THOSE CHANGES- HAVE COME INTO PLAY OVER THE YEARS LIKE WE HAD PLANNED ON THEM. AND HOW ALL THAT IS GOING. IT IS PROBABLY OF ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS THAT ONE IS THE MOST POPULAR ONE AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE VERY. EDS POSITIVE IMPACT AIR QUALITY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. AND SO. IT IS. FROM EVERYTHING THAT I HEAR FROM MY STAKEHOLDERS IS THAT. GRAHAM WAS WORKING REALLY REALLY WELL- AND THE INTEREST ESPECIALLY NOW WITH OUR EXECUTIVE ORDER US YOU. SHOULD BE A CALLS. AND GOING TO WHEREVER IT IS POSSIBLE AND TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE- ALLEGED VEHICLES I THINK YOU'LL CONTINUE TO SEE ALL PROPRIETY. OF OPTIONS IN THAT PROGRAM. I'M THE ONE THING WE DON'T WANT TO O IS ALLOW FOR INTERRUPTION OF THE SONS. BECAUSE IT IS ACCOMPLISHING SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY. REDUCTION WE- AND ONE OF OUR- SEVERELY. BASINS IN TOUCH. I SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR INCLUDED. ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND HIS PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THAT PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE NOW THIS IS AN INVESTMENT THAT'S WORTH MAKING IT HAS HUGE PUBLIC BENEFIT. YEAH AND HELPING TO REDUCE THE COST TO OUR FARMERS AND INCLUDING A PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. ISSUES SUCH. NO I ABSOLUTELY AGREE I KNOW IT IT HELPS- REMOVE A LOT OF THE KNOX WHICH IS THE HARSHER OF AIR POLLUTANTS ON ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES YOU AS ALWAYS YOU KNOW I'M HERE TO HELP ALL ALONG THOSE LINES. LIKEWISE ANYWAY. THAT'S THE END OF MY QUESTIONS GOOD TO SEE YOU SECRETARY THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH. RUSSIA HAS OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I THINK I HAVE A REALLY EASY QUESTION SECRETARY ROSS- POST TO MY- COLLEAGUE ON MY RIGHT- YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SUMMARY YOU PROVIDED ABOUT ALL THE PROGRAMS OFFERED THROUGH- YOU KNOW THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENT FARMING IN INNOVATION. E. D. DID YOU KNOW HOW MANY OTHER STATES HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR. SO OKLAHOMA AT ONE POINT- INVESTED AND HEALTHY SOURCE PRACTICES AND THE STATE OF IOWA HAS INVESTED AND COVER CROPPING TO ADDRESS THEIR NITRATE RUNOFF PROBLEM. BUT NO OTHER STATE HAS A SUITE OF CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES- WITH THE KIND OF INVESTMENT THE CALIFORNIA HAS MADE. OR WITH THE QUANTIFICATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND THAT'S WHY I WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO WORK WITH U. S. GAAP MAKE THEIR COMBAT ARMOR. AT METHODOLOGY TOOL WORK FOR SPECIALTY CROPS- AND SO WE I CAN SAY I AM VERY PROBABLY FOR THE ONLY STATE THAT HOUSE THIS WHOLE SUITE OF PRACTICES THAT WE COST SHARE WITH OUR FARMERS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND THAT WE MAJORETTES AND QUANTIFY IT AND. ASSIGN YEARS. I PRACTICE TO GO WITH. SO IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA'S MADE AS A VERY IMPORTANT SIGNAL TO THE MARKET PLACE AND OTHERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN FINDING SOLVE HEALTH PRACTICES WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO LOOK AT OUR SUITE OF PRACTICES THAT ARE BASED ON SCIENCE BETTER KNOWN TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND WE'D LOVE TO LEVERAGE PRIVATE SECTOR DOLLARS PROGRESS WELL. WELL THANK YOU I OPPOSITE THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FROM SOME A MEMBER LEVINE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CARE THINKS HER FOR CALLING THIS MEETING SECRETARY ROSS GREAT TO- TO SEE VIRTUALLY. THANK YOU FOR. YEAH THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDER. CONTINUED LEADERSHIP OF- DEPARTMENT. AND AND YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT PARTNER- GREAT PART OF THE LEGISLATURE IN A GREAT PARTNER TO ME. AND OF COURSE TO IT TO AGRICULTURE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I REALLY ENJOYED HEARING OR APPRECIATED HEARING- YOUR PLUG FOR HEALTHY SOILS AND GLAD THAT YOU LIKE IT I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC FOR OUR STATE FOR. DROUGHT TOLERANCE FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION FOR SO MANY REASONS. AND AND I KNOW THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE MISSED A LITTLE BIT OF FUNDING- THEN WE COULD GO BACK UP AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE SEEN. OUR FURTHER INVESTMENT IN THAT PROGRAM INTO THE FUTURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT FISHING AT. AND WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. GOOD TO SEE SECRETARY ROSS FIRST TIME ON THIS COMMITTEE AND SO I'M SITTING HERE NOODLING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A POTENTIAL QUESTIONS SO- HE- I THINK ABOUT MY DISTRICT- IN PARTICULAR WITH RELATION TO FIRES AND ALL THE GREENHOUSE GASES THAT WE- IN YOUR WE TALK A LOT ABOUT HEALTHY SOILS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. ARE THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR FARMERS RANCHERS AND GRAZING- GRANTS BECAUSE WE CAN IF WE CAN GRACE SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT ARE OVER-GROUND POSSIBLY. WE CAN REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF FIRE AND PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND I USE AN EXAMPLE OF THE POPLIN FIELD STATION WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT SO. VERY STARK CONTRAST A COUPLE FIRES A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WHERE YOU HAD AN AREA THAT WAS GRAZED NEXT TO AN AREA THAT WASN'T CRAZY IN A FIRE WENT THROUGH IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THAT THE TIME THE LARGEST FIRE IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE. IT WAS IT WAS A IT WAS THERE A YEAR LATER THE STARK. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PIECES OF PROPERTY. ONE WAS ONE ONE WAS ALREADY RECOVERING AND THE OTHER PART MAY NEVER RECOVER SO AS WE ARE LOOKING AT INITIATIVES THAT WILL HELP REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES- SOME OF THAT. I HOPE CAN BE LANDSCAPE RELATED FOR FIRE PREVENTION BECAUSE- THE STORY I READ SAID THAT HALF OF THE POLLUTION. THAT WAS LIBERATED LAST YEAR CAME FROM FOREST FIRES SO JUST IT'S JUST MORE OF A COMMENTARY I THINK YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF THIS- BUT- BUT- YEAH. NOT SURE I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHERE THIS FALLS IN QUITE FRANKLY. BUT IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT IS SOMETHING THAT I JUST SPOKE AT OUTLOOK pWILDFIRES AND- IMPACTS TO AGRICULTURE. AND SO I THINK THIS WE ALREADY FUND PRESCRIBED ROTATIONAL GRAZING PRACTICES AS PART OF HEALTHY STYLE WE FUND APPLICATION OF COMPOST AND RANGE THAT FOR HEALTHY SOIL. AND IT'S REALLY WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH MY COLLEAGUES OF RESOURCES AGENCY AS WE DO ALL THE- WE CAN. FOR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE AND BAD CLEARLY. ROTATIONAL GRAZING AND ALLOWING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS ONE CRITICAL PIECE OF THAT PICTURE AS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE UP A CONVERSATION WITH MY COLLEAGUE SECRETARY PROFESS. AND SEE IF THERE COULD BE SOME. WORDS WHAT OF OUR PROGRAM I DON'T KNOW ONE IT WOULD BE BETTER I'M TO DOING THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT YOU CAN HAVE. IT AND- ALL. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANNA. BIG FAN OF THE SWEET PROGRAM AND THROUGH THE WORK IS DONE THERE I WISH WE COULD FIND MORE RESOURCES FOR THAT BECAUSE THERE'S SOME REALLY INNOVATIVE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING OUT THERE WHEN YOU'VE GOT A PROGRAM THAT'S 3100% OVERSUBSCRIBED. THAT I TO TELL SOMEBODY SOMETHING AND WE REALLY NEED TO FIND RESOURCES TO HELP BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PRACTICES THAT I KNOW OR SEQUESTERING HUGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON IN THE SOIL AND ONE IN PARTICULAR MY DISTRICT. I WOULD PUT A PLUG IN THEM ONTO A PUBLICLY IS A LITTLE IS A LITTLE ORGANIC FARM CALLED FORTUNATE FARM THE YOU SPENT GRAIN FROM A BREWERY. THE ONLY ONE OF THREE- NON GMO OR BREWERIES IN. INSTEAD OF. I GET I GET THAT RIGHT ANYWAY. YEAH IN IN IN THE COUNTRY AND THEY HAVE SOME QUIZZICAL THE USE THAT SPENT SO AS A WAY TO AMEND THEIR SOIL AND THEY SOUTHWESTERN MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF CARBON IN IN THEIR SOIL AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S OTHER OTHER THINGS OUT THERE THAT COULD BE DOING THAT AND I GUESS MY POINT ON THIS IS. THESE ARE OUR- RELATIVELY LOW COST LOW IMPACT. AND I YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE WE CHASE TECHNOLOGY ALL THE TIMES BUT I THINK SOMETIMES WE REALLY DO MISS. REALLY SUBSTANTIVE OPPORTUNITIES WHEN WE CHASE TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT I LIKE TO SAY SOMETIMES IS THE SHINY SHINY OBJECT IN THE IN THE DISTANCE OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR SUCH A CONTEST. WHAT SECRETARY ROSS AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE TIME FOR US AND- YOU KNOW FOR- FOR- ALL OF THE ANSWERS AND- YOUR FEEDBACK SO LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU AND- I'M SURE WE'LL SEE YOU OON. I HOPE SO THANKS VICTOR. OKAY SO MOVING TO OUR SECOND PANEL IN OUR SECOND PANEL FEATURES A DIVERSE SET OF THREE FARMERS FROM THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. ALL OF WHOM HAVE HAVE LIVED AND BREATHED- ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING IN THEIR OPERATIONS THEY HAVE FIRST HAND REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE FOR WHAT'S WORKING. I AND ALSO WHAT MORE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT ENVIRONMENT FARMING IS SUCCESSFUL IN THIS STATE. FIRST I'D LIKE TO WELCOME GRAMMY AWARD WINNING SINGER SONG WRITER OCEANSIDE AVOCADO GROWER J. SIN RAZ- SO JASON IS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY BY VIDEO CONFERENCE MR MORASS GRACIOUSLY HOSTED ME ON. A TOUR OF HIS AVOCADO AND COFFEE RANCH IN NOVEMBER AS WE WERE ON OUR AG TOUR- HIS PASSION FOR ORGANIC AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE WAS. VERY VERY CLEAR YOU KNOW AND SO JASON WELCOME- YOU KNOW THIS MAY BE THE FIRST. AND HOPEFULLY NOT THE LAST TIME THAT WE HAVE A GRAMMY AWARD WINNING SINGER SONG WRITER PRESENT IN THE COMMITTEE OF AGRICULTURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN RIVAS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I AM JASON RANSOM APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY PASSION FOR REGENERATIVE FARMING WITH YOU TODAY. I FARM AVOCADOS ALONGSIDE GROWING COFFEE BANANAS IN PASSION FRUIT. IN ADDITION TO BEING A FARMER I ALSO DO A LITTLE MUSIC. I'LL SHARE MORE ABOUT MY FARM IN MY STORY SHORTLY BUT I FIRST WANT TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S GREAT AVOCADO INDUSTRY. AS TO THAT HEY I AM APPEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AVOCADO COMMISSION. CALIFORNIA FARMERS GROW OVER AVOCADO PRODUCTION WITH FLORIDA WHY MAKING UP THE REMAINING TEN PERCENT. CALIFORNIA PRODUCES WITH THE READY REPRESENTING 95% OF CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL PRODUCTION. CALIFORNIA HAS NEARLY TWO THOUSAND COMMERCIAL AVOCADO FARMERS WHO FARM ON ABOUT FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND ACRES. MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S AVOCADO FARMERS COME FROM MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILY FARMS WITH THE AVERAGE GROUP SIZE AROUND TWENTY TO THIRTY ACRES. CALIFORNIA'S AVOCADO ANNUAL PRODUCTION AVERAGES BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS AND IS GROWN PRIMARILY IN THE COUNTIES OF SAN DIEGO RIVERSIDE VENTURA SANTA BARBARA AND SAN LUIS OBISPO. CALIFORNIA AVOCADO FARMERS HAVE AN AVERAGE FARMGATE VALUE OF THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE MILLION PER YEAR BASED ON THE LAST TEN YEARS. FOR TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA AVOCADO FARMERS AND PACKERS EMPLOYED NEARLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AND GENERATED ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT. LABOR INCOME TOTALED SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION AND ALMOST FORTY ONE MILLION INDIRECT BUSINESS TAXES WAS GENERATED BY GROWERS AND PACKERS. IN TWO THOUSAND THE TOTAL US CONSUMPTION OF HASS AVOCADOS WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION POUNDS. FAST FOR TWENTY YEARS THE TOTAL U. S. I HAVE A KIND OF CONSUMPTION IN TWENTY TWENTY INCREASED TO TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION POUNDS AN INCREDIBLE FOUR HUNDRED. PLUS PERCENT INCREASE. DURING THAT TIME CALIFORNIA'S U. S. MARKET SHARE WENT FROM 66% TWO THOUSAND TO JUST 13% IN TWENTY TWENTY THE INCREASED IMPORT VOLUMES COME PRIMARILY FROM MEXICO. 80% OF THE TOTAL U. S. VOLUME LAST YEAR. CALIFORNIA AVOCADO FARMERS INPUT COSTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN OUR OFF SHORE FARMERS WATER COSTS CAN RUN AS HIGH AS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PER ACRE FOOT. WITH AN AVERAGE YEARLY COST OF SIXTY THREE HUNDRED PER ACRE AND LABOR HOURLY RATES AVERAGING EIGHTEEN DOLLARS OR MORE PER HOUR. FARMERS ARE CONTINUING TO FACE RAPIDLY INCREASING LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE COSTS. AND AS WITH ANY BUSINESS FARMERS MUST MAKE PROFIT TO REMAIN VIABLE. IF AT THE END OF THE DAY WERE NOT PROFITABLE ANY EFFORTS TO CHANGE AND IMPROVE OUR SUSTAINABILITY PRACTICES AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING THEY JUST WON'T MATTER. UNLIKE MOST BUSINESSES FARMERS ARE PRICE TAKERS NOT PRICE SETTERS WE ARE AT THE MERCY OF CURRENT MARKET PRICING WE INVEST ALL YEAR LONG TO GROW OUR CROPS. AND WE PRAY THAT THE FARM GATE PRICE WILL AT A MINIMUM COVER OUR INPUT COSTS SO THAT WE CAN AT LEAST. BREAK EVEN. THE CALIFORNIA AVOCADO PRODUCTION CONTRIBUTES TO CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNITIES. WE PROVIDE BENEFITS SUCH AS SERVING A HEDGE AGAINST THE SPREAD OF WILDFIRES. WE PROVIDE CARBON SEQUESTRATION EROSION CONTROL OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION AND INCREASE AND IMPROVE AIR QUALITY. WE ARE ESSENTIALLY IRRIGATED PERENNIAL FARMLANDS. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT AVOCADO GROWERS HAD A NET SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN KISS THE GROUND A NEW DOCUMENTARY ON NETFLIX WHICH EXPLAINS EXAMINES HOW CHILLING HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ECOLOGY HEALTH AND CLIMATE AND FOCUSES ON REGENERATIVE FARMING TO RESTORE DEGRADED LANDS AND FACILITATE HARBINGER ARE DOWN. ONCE AN AVOCADO GROWERS PLANTED NO TELLING OCCURS WE DON'T DISTURB THE SOIL MOST TREES REMAIN IN THE GROUND FOR UP TO FIFTY YEARS MORE. THE TREES IN MY GROUP HAD OUTLIVED THE PREVIOUS OWNER AND I EXPECT THE TREES THAT I PLANTED TO OUTLIVE ME. AND AVOCADO GROVE CREATES NATURAL LEAF LITTER WHICH DECOMPOSE INTO THE SOIL HELPING TO REGENERATE INTO HEALTHY SOILS THAT SEQUESTER CARBON INCREASE. THE LANDSCAPE. AS WE KNOW HEALTHY SOIL LEADSTO A HEALTHY LIFE THERE UNDERNEATH EVERY FOOTSTEP ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES OF MYCELIAL FUNGI WHICH CONNECT TO. LANCE BE ON OUR OWN- SMALL FARM EIGHT RIDGES. SO THE MORE WE CAN ENCOURAGE AND INSPIRE HEALTHY LAND MANAGEMENT FOR ALL THE HEALTHIER OUR STATE WILL BE A SPONGE FOR WATER AND CARBON. I BEGAN FARMING AVOCADOS AS A HOBBY INTEREST IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS AND IT BECAME A BUSINESS FOR ME IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. WHEN I SAW I NEED TO CREATE A DIRECT TO CONSUMER BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO REALLY COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE. I FOUND IT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A PROFIT JUST ON AVOCADOS ALONE- BECAUSE AS I SAID WE'RE LUCKY IF WE CAN BREAK EVEN. SO I BEGAN TO PLANT OTHER CROPS DIVERSE TO FIVE MY LANDSCAPE. ARE ADDING COFFEE BETWEEN MY ROSE- AND BANANAS EVEN HOW TO LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL REVENUE- AGAIN CORREGGIO TREES AND HARDLY DISTURBING THE SOIL. KEEPING UP WITH ALL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL IS. DAUNTING IT REALLY IS IT'S TOUGH IN GETTING GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S RECENTLY RELEASED CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE ACTION PLAN HE FOCUSES ON BUILDING RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND I LOVE THAT WORD- BECAUSE IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE AS AVOCADO GROWERS I FEEL ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THAT RESILIENCE THAT WE NEED. GOVERNOR NEWSOM SAID IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO THE SCALE OF THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE OUR STATE IS FACING CALIFORNIA ALSO NEEDS A COMPREHENSIVE AND WELL FUNDED CLIMATE RESILIENCE BOND. TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S IMMEDIATE CLIMATE RISKS INCLUDING WILDFIRE EXTREME HEAT DROUGHT AND FLOODING. A BOND WITH XCELERATED INVESTMENTS IMPROVING CLIMATE RESILIENCE STRATEGIES THAT SAFEGUARD BOTH HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AS I HAVE SHARED CALIFORNIA AVOCADO GROWERS ARE ALREADY PART OF BUILDING RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND IT IS IMPORTANT WE FIND A WAY TO BE RECOGNIZED. FOR OUR EXISTING CONTRIBUTIONS. IN CONCLUSION. AVOCADO TREES IN CALIFORNIA CHECK THE ENVIRONMENT WE ENHANCE THE ECONOMY AND WE IMPROVE COMMUNITIES SCIENTIFIC DATA SHOWS THAT AVOCADO TREES CAPTURE CARBON AND YET CALIFORNIA'S CAP AND TRADE RULES DO NOT FINANCIALLY RECOGNIZE THIS BENEFIT WHICH IS OFFERED TO MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES. FAILING TO PROVIDE SUCH SUPPORT WHEN COMBINED WITH INCREASING AVOCADO IMPORTS AND SKYROCKETING PRODUCTION COSTS IS CREATING AN UNMANAGEABLE FINANCIAL SQUEEZE FOR AVOCADO FARMERS. AND IS HASTENING URBANIZATION. ESPECIALLY RIGHT HERE IN MY HEART. FOR THOSE AN AVOCADO INDUSTRY THE NEED IS OBVIOUS AND THE SOLUTION IS SIMPLE WITH YOUR SUPPORT AND AVOCADO FARMERS WORKING IN COOPERATION WITH CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TOGETHER WE CAN DEVELOP A PROTOCOL WHICH ESTABLISHES CARBON SEQUESTRATION CREDITS FOR BOTH ESTABLISHED AND NEWLY PLANTED TREES. CALIFORNIA BENEFITS FROM FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND ACRES OF AVOCADO TREES MANY ARE PLANTED ON SLOPES HILLSIDES WHERE LITTLE ELSE CAN BE PRODUCED PROVIDING MULTIPLE IMPORTANT BENEFITS SUCH AS REDUCED BED VEGETATION WHICH ROUTE WHICH FUELS FOREST FIRES. ARE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANSING OF CARBON THOUSANDS OF JOBS A BUFFER TO URBAN SPRAWL AND OF COURSE THE BEST TASTING MOST NUTRITIOUS AVOCADOS IN THE UNITED STATES AND BEYOND WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY BEFORE US CALIFORNIA FARMING AND CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT. TO BE GREAT STEWARDS OF OUR ENVIRONMENT CAN CO EXIST THANK YOU CHAIRMAN REVERSING COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME AND INTEREST I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. WHAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION JASON I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU- SPOKE ABOUT- THE UNIQUE OPERATION YOU HAVE WITH THE COFFEE IN THE BANANAS GROWING WITHIN THE AVOCADO GROW I WOULD DOUBT THAT WAS VERY SURPRISING TO ME AND- I'M GLAD THAT YOU MENTIONED. SO AND THEN YES WE I'M SURE WE WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL- THE SECOND- THE SPEAKER WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME CHRISTINE. K. GAMP EARLY RIGHT GAMPER LEAGUE. YOU CAN COME TO THE TABLE IF YOU LIKE. THAT'S FINE- AND SO SHE IS HERE WITH US- AND SO MS KIMBERLY IS A SECOND GENERATION ALMOND FARMER AND A BEEKEEPER SHE AND HER BROTHER ERIC FARM FORTY ACRES OF ALMONDS NEAR TURLOCK IN STANISLAUS COUNTY- AND ANOTHER NINETY THREE ACRES IN NEARBY GUSTINE SO MISS CAMPOLI THANK YOU- FOR BEING WITH US AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I AM VERY EXCITED TO PRESENT TO YOU THE ALLMAN INDUSTRIES TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS. THREE YEARS AGO THE ALMOND BOARD MEMBERS AND SENIOR STAFF MATT KERR ABOUT A NEW PATH FOR THE ALMOND INDUSTRY. ONE THAT RECOGNIZE OUR CHANGING CLIMATE AND OUR CHANGING WORLD. ONE THAT KEPT US TWO STEPS AHEAD INSTEAD OF PLAYING CATCH UP. WE WANTED TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. THE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT MEETING RESULTED IN FOUR GOALS. RIGHT THERE. REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO GROW POUND OF ALMONDS BY 20% INCREASE IN THE ADOPTION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PEST MANAGEMENT BY 25% REDUCING OUR DUST AT HARVEST BY 50% AND BECOMING A ZERO WASTE INDUSTRY WITH NOT ONLY THE WHOLE AND SHALL. BECOME A VALUABLE CO PRODUCTS BUT WITH THE WOODY BIOMASS FROM THE TREES BEING UTILIZED. I WILL START. YOU HAVE THE WRONG SLIDES M. GO AHEAD DOESN'T GO ONE MORE AHEAD. THERE YOU GO. I WILL START WITH ZERO WASTE HISTORICALLY THE WOODY BIOMASS FROM THE ORCHARD REMOVAL WAS BURNED AND THEN CAME CO GENERATION PLANTS OFFERING ONE OPTION TO WHICH- TO UTILIZE THE SHREDDED ORCHARDS. FARMERS COULD MITIGATE THE COST OF THE ORCHARD REMOVAL WITH THE REVENUE IT GENERATED BUT WE KNOW CO GENERATION IS BEING PHASED OUT. NOW AFTER YEARS OF ALMOND BOARD FUNDED RESEARCH WE ARE RECYCLING WHOLE ORCHARDS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT NOT ONLY IS CARBON SEQUESTERED BUT THE WATER HOLDING CAPACITY OF THE SOIL IS INCREASED BY UP NOT JUST A SELLING POINT. THAT'S A NO BRAINER. A GAME CHANGER SPECIALLY AND WATER CHALLENGED AREAS. TWO YEARS AGO WE CHIPPED IN INCORPORATED THE FIRST TO TWENTY ACRES AND WE'LL DO ANOTHER NINETY TWO ACRES THIS FALL AT THE ONSET OF OUR FIRST PROJECT GRANTS DID NOT EXIST. BUT DID BECOME AVAILABLE THROUGH HEALTHY SOILS IN THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD A WEEK AFTER WE SPREAD OUR LAST CHIP SO YOU BETTER BELIEVE I HAVE MY APPLICATION AND FOR THE NEXT NINETY TWO ACRES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS TRANSFORMATIVE UNDERTAKING IS COSTLY. WITH EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT THAT GROWERS WOULD OR COULD NEVER OUT. DOING THE RIGHT THING IS NEVER CHEAP. THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS ARE NOT IMMEDIATE AND ARE SPECIALLY HARD FOR SMALL GROWERS WHO DO NOT BENEFIT FROM THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE. THE ALMOND INDUSTRY HAS ALREADY BEEN REDUCING ITS WATER USE PER POUND OF NUTS OVER THE LAST. TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS A MAJORITY OF FARMERS TO SWITCH FROM FLOOD TO MY CHRIS WRANGLER DRIP OR SUBSURFACE IRRIGATION. NOW THERE ARE FARMERS WHO HAVE NEVER EVEN FLOODED THEIR ORCHARDS PRECISION IRRIGATION USING TREE BIOLOGY COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND ADVANCED EQUIPMENT. COMBINED WITH INCREASED WATER HOLDING CAPACITY CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WATER SAVINGS WERE WE DIDN'T THINK WE COULD SQUEEZE OUT ANYMORE. OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OUR FIRM HAS USE NRCS GRANTS TO CHANGE FROM FLOOD TO MIKE REYES WRANGLERS BUT NOW WE ARE TURNING TO SWEEP PROGRAM TO HELP US IMPROVE FURTHER. HAVING A COST SHARE HAS ALLOWED US TO PUT IN AN EFFICIENT. I'M SORRY THIS TURN IN THE WRONGFUL. YOU GUYS OF THE RUGS LAID FLAT WELL TO STOP THEIR. HAVE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE THE LOUDEST TO PUT IN AN EFFICIENT YOU'RE ENGAGED IN SYSTEM WE MIGHT OPPOSE BOEHNER FOR GOD. IT MAKES THE FERMENTABLE DOABLE WITHOUT GRANTS WE WOULD NOT HAVE PUT INTO SOIL MOISTURE MONITORING STATIONS FROM WHICH WHICH INFORM OUR DECISIONS. ON OUR WEBSITE ORCHARD WE HAVE TAKEN WATER SAVING TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OUT OF NECESSITY FROM HAVING SEEN ZERO WATER ALLOTMENTS ALL TOO FREQUENTLY. OUR INDUSTRY HAS LEARNED MUCH FROM THE DROUGHT AND THAT THREAT ALWAYS LOOMS LARGE SPECIFICALLY ON OUR SITE WE HAVE LEARNED THREE STUDIES FUNDED BY THE ALMOND BOARD AND WORKING DIRECTLY WITH RESEARCHERS TO USE SOIL MOISTURE MONITORING TO DELAY THE ONSET OF IRRIGATION. TO USE DEFICIT YOU'RE A NATION STRATEGIES AND EVAPORATE TRANSPIRATION RATES TO STRATEGICALLY SCHEDULE IRRIGATION. THE RECENTLY pBLOCK UTILIZED HERE BUT NOT HERE. KIND OF- HAS A FOUR FOOT RADIUS WHICH WILL LATER EXPAND TO EIGHT FEET AND THIS ALLOWS US TO REDUCE OUR WATER USED BY ALMOST 50% AND DISCOURAGE WEED GROWTH SIMPLY PUT NO WATER NO WEEKS. DON'T CHANGE THIS LIFE HERE TWO MONTHS LATER IN THE SAME ORCHARD YOU CAN SEE OR NOT HOW EVENLY THE TREES HAVE GROWN WITH TARGETED FERTILIZER APPLICATION AND NO COMPETITION FROM WEEDS WE'LL SEE THOSE PICTURES IN A BET. THE CENTERS OF THE ROSE REPRESENTING TWO THIRDS OF THE ACREAGE TO THIS DAY HAVE NEVER BEEN SPRAYED WITH HERBICIDE. AND THAT GETS ME TO OUR THIRD GOAL YOU CAN STAY HERE. ADOPTION IN THE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PEST MANAGEMENT NO THE SYNERGIES BETWEEN OUR ZERO WASTE WATER AND PEST MANAGEMENT GOALS OVER THE YEARS GROWERS PESTICIDE USE HAS TRENDED DOWN. AND OUR TECHNOLOGY AND MONITORING HAS ALLOWED FOR PRECISION APPLICATION AND TARGETING OF PESTS ALMOND BOARD FUNDED RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DORMANT SPRAYS COULD BE ELIMINATED PAST MONITORING HELPED US TO MORE EFFECTIVELY TIME OR ELIMINATE SOME OF OUR CROP PROTECTION MATERIALS. AND HERE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT SIDE MORE RECENTLY WE HAVE BEEN EXPLORING COVER CROPS IN OUR ORCHARDS AND LOOKING AT THEIR BENEFITS TO NOT JUST HONEY BEES AND NATIVE POLLINATORS BUT TO BENEFICIAL INSECTS TO CONTROL PESTS I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE BENEFITS. OF COVER CROPS AND THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM WHICH PROMOTES AND FINANCIALLY SUPPORTS THEIR USE. GRANTS HELP TO INCREASE THIS PRACTICES REACH ESPECIALLY WITH SMALLER GROWERS. ON OUR FARM I HAVE PERSONALLY OBSERVED HERBICIDE RESISTANT WEEDS OUT COMPETED. INCREASES A BENEFICIAL INSECTS INSECT POPULATIONS AND I'VE SEEN MY BEEKEEPERS COLONIES FLOURISHING BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THE ALMOND BLOOM. I HAVEN'T EVEN TOUCHED ON THE SOIL HEALTH BENEFITS SUCH AS ADDING ORGANIC MATTER AND NITROGEN FIXATION. LOOK AT THESE PICTURES. THIS IS HABITAT THESE ARE ECOSYSTEMS. WE CUT OUR INSECTICIDE USED BY TWO THIRDS AND STILL TURNED IN TOP QUALITY NUTS BUT THIS IS NOT WHERE WE ARE STOPPING WE ARE COTINUING WITH PROVEN CULTURAL PRACTICES LIKE ORCHARD SANITATION. WHILE ALSO EXPLORING STERILE INSECT TECHNOLOGY TO PREVENT AND MEET PASS PROBLEMS HEAD ON. RECALL HELLO YOU CAN'T RECALL IT BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET BUT RECALL THE PITCHER OF THE YOUNG TREES WITH NO WEEDS IN THE MIDDLE DURING THE SUMMER THAT LOOKS SO BARE. THE LOWER SET OF PICTURES IS THAT SAME BLOCK FROM EARLIER IN THE SPRING WHICH WE UTILIZE WINTER RAINS TO GROW COVER CROPS THEN TILL NTO THE SOIL JUST THE TOP THREE INCHES UP.THE PEAS AND CHEST TIED MUSTARD RECOVERED IN LADY BAGS OF NATIVE POLLINATORS. AND PAULINE IN CARBON FROM THE AIR THE WHOLE TIME AS THEY GROW. SLIDE. OKAY YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT ONE BEFORE GO AHEAD AND. THERE IS THAT BLOOD BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T HAVE WEEDS ON IT THAT WAS THE SAME WHEN YOU SAW BEFORE. AND ONE MORE. AND THERE IT IS TWO MONTHS LATER STILL NO WEEDS STILL NO HERBICIDE USED IN THE CENTERS AND GROWING EVENLY AND BEAUTIFULLY WITH TARGETED FERTILIZER APPLICATION. OKAY GO AHEAD. AND NOW WE COME TO OUR LAST GOAL OF DUST REDUCTION WHICH HAS PERHAPS BEEN THE MOST DIFFICULT AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE COLLABORATION ON A MASSIVE SCALE BECAUSE IT WILL INVOLVE CHANGING HOW WE DO THINGS FROM BEGINNING TO END. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT WILL BE EXPENSIVE FOR EVERYONE TO HARVEST OFF GROUND ORCHARDS WILL HAVE TO BE MANAGED DIFFERENTLY TO ACCOMMODATE NEW EQUIPMENT ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND PROCESS THESE FOR DRYING THAT'S WILL HAVE TO BE ENGINEERED AND IMPLEMENTED ALL WILL STILL TRYING TO GET EVERY NOT OUT OF THE ORCHARD TO MAINTAIN ZERO WASTE AND REDUCE PEST HABITAT. THERE ALSO REMAIN THE QUESTION OF HOW FARMERS AND HAULERS WILL OF FOR THE TRANSITION THE THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BIGGEST MAYBE HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO MAKE THESE CHANGES AND THE RIPPLE EFFECTS. FOR NOW MY BROTHER AND I FOLLOW BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES CAREFULLY WATCHING HOW WE MANAGE THE ORCHARD FLOOR. I JUST OUR EQUIPMENT AND MAKE OUR PASSES WE ALSO WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN UPGRADING THE DUST. BUT FULHAM REPLACEMENT ISN'T ALWAYS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US GETTING-PAID FOR A YEAR'S WORTH OF WORK AND NOT GETTING PAID AT ALL. COST SHARE GRANTS FOR NEW EQUIPMENT FOR RETROFITS CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO OPERATIONS OF ALL SIZES. WE WILL REDUCE OUR DUST BUT WE NIGHT WE MIGHT NOT QUITE REACH GOALS ARE MEANT TO BE HARD TO REACH IF THEY WORK HARD THEY WOULDN'T QUALIFY AS A GOAL. BUT JUST IN SETTING THEM WE INITIATE CHANGE. RIGHT. AND I WANT TO CLOSE WITH A FEW THINGS ILLUSTRATING HOW ARE GOALS EMPHASIZE THAT SUSTAINABILITY IS A JOURNEY NOT A DESTINATION I ALSO PITCHER THE ALMOND INDUSTRY AS A FOOD WEB WE ARE DEEPLY INTERCONNECTED WITH OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH INCLUDE OUR LABOR FORCE THE HOLLERS AND THE PROCESSORS THE UNIVERSITIES WHERE RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED THE BUSINESS AN ENGINE ENGINEERS THAT DEVELOP OUR EQUIPMENT THE COMPANIES THEY GIVE US CROP PROTECTION AND THE TECH INDUSTRY THAT ENABLES. INNOVATION AND IF ANY FOOD WEB WHEN ONE PART BECOMES WEAK THE OTHERS SUFFER AS WELL. IMBALANCE LEADS TO DYSFUNCTION SO WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EVERY PART OF OUR WEB BEING SUPPORTED IN REMAINING HEALTHY. ANOTHER THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT EVERY PRACTICE DOES NOT WORK FOR EVERY OPERATION EVERYONE WILL HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE COMBINATION OF WHAT GETS THEM CLOSER TO THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS. WHICH WE MONITOR MONITOR IN OUR SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE TRADE OFFS WERE MADE SHOES AND ULTRA EFFICIENT IRRIGATION SYSTEM THAT SAVES WATER ND REDUCES HERBICIDE USE. BUT ALSO REDUCES THE BILITY TO HAVE A CROP COVER CROP OUTSIDE OF THE RAINY SEASON. IF WE HAVE WHAT. ANOTHER MERMAID SHOES COVER CROPS KNOWING EXTRA TRACTOR HOURS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MANAGE IT. THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF THE DECISIONS WE MAKE EVERY SINGLE DAY SMALL FARMS FACE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THAN LARGER ONES. BUT WE ARE ALL CHALLENGED. ONE THING WE DO HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT EVERY SINGLE ALMOND FARMER IN CALIFORNIA HAS INVESTED FINANCIALLY THROUGH THEIR CROP ASSESSMENT IN THE RESEARCH IN THE WORK BEING DONE TO CREATE CHANGE. OUR INVESTMENT DOES NOT STOP IT RESEARCH THAT CONTINUES ON TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. WHICH ARE THEN BROUGHT TO GROWERS AND PUT TO USE WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO THE FUTURE. AND THAT IS THAT'S THE ALMOND INDUSTRY AND NHL THANK YOU. PUN INTENDED. THE CHRISTINE REALLY APPRECIATE- YOUR PRESENTATION- AND I'M SURE THERE WILL BE SOME QUESTIONS OKAY I DO I STAY HERE GO BACK THERE- IF YOU GO BACK IT WOULD BE. YEAH YOU KNOW. NO PROBABLY NOT YEAH SO IF YOU GO BACK- THAT WOULD BE GREAT SIX BUTTONS THAT WILL GET MY DOG UP HERE. SO OUR FINAL- SPEAKER AND PRESENTER- ON THIS PANEL IS CINEMA COUNTY DAIRY OPERATOR DIED BERETTA- WHO IS ALSO HERE WITH US IN THE HEARING ROOM MISTER BERBER RED AND HIS FAMILY OPERATE ORGANIC DAIRY SOUTHWEST OF SANTA ROSA. I HAD THE PROFILE I HAD THE- THE PRIVILEGE IN JOINING ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE AND VISITING. HIS FARM IN HIS DAIRY I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS EFFORTS TO PURSUE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN THAT OPERATION. I WAS ALSO IMPRESSED WITH HIS COWS WHICH DEFINITELY APPEARED TO BE AMONG THE HAPPIEST I HAVE SEEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND SO WITH THAT THE FLOOR IS YOURS DOUG. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I FELT THAT- WHEN I WHEN I WAS REACH OUT TO IN THE INVITE TO COME OVER I FELT THAT THIS WAS THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO COME MEET PERSONALLY HERE AFTER YOU SPENT THE TIME AT MY FARM- LISTENING AND I DO APPRECIATE. THE INVITATION- JUST QUICK LITTLE OVERVIEW I KINDA CAME WITH A LITTLE DIFFERENT- MAYBE MESSAGE SINCE THE OTHER TWO PRESENTERS I'M I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I'VE WHAT ARE FORM IS DONE OVER THE YEARS- WE MILK ABOUT THREE HUNDRED CALS WE OWN FOR WE ON ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY ACRES AND TWO RANCHES AND I ALSO LEASE A HUNDRED AND FORTY ACRES OF STATE OWNED. MITIGATION LAND FOR ENDANGERED SPECIES FROM CALIFORNIA APARTMENT- AND- CDFW NOW IS A DISINCENTIVE FOR SCHWAB SO- I GUESS THAT WE NOT THREE- CAL'S IN- TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WE'VE MADE THE TRANSITION TO ORGANIC- WE WERE CONVENTIONAL DAIRY. UP UNTIL THEN AND JUST IN OUR AREA WITH THE PASSION THAT WE HAVE AND MOST OF THE DAIRIES IN OUR AREA ABOUT 90% OF OUR ORGANIC. WE HAVE A TEN TO GROW PASTURE WHERE THE DAIRIES. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS MISTER MATHIS pABILITY TO GROW MORE OF THEIR OWN FEED AND HAY AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT WE'RE ALL THE SAME. DAIRY INDUSTRY I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT. TOO MANY PEOPLE TRY TO SEPARATE THE ORGANIC IN THE CONVENTIONAL AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT DO. IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY WE'RE ALL MEANT TO PRODUCE. THE BEST QUALITY MILK THAT WE CAN'T IS DEFEATED- FEET ARE. OUR PEOPLE- SO AGAIN AND- SIX WE WENT AHEAD AND TRANSITION TO ORGANIC- I AM THIRD GENERATION I HAVE TO MY CHILDREN- MY OLDEST DAUGHTER MY YOUNGEST SON ON THE FARM WITH ME AND I ALSO AVE A NINE YEAR OLD GRANDSON. THAT IS FALLING HE'S PROBABLY BETTER THAN THAT THE TWO OLDER KIDS RELEASE T. HE COMES TO WORK EVERY DAY- BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT. THAT WE'VE DONE IT BREADED JERRY OVER THE YEARS- MY GRANDFATHER WAS VERY INNOVATIVE AND IN IN THE- LATE MIDDLE SIXTIES. DECIDED THAT HE SHOULD BUILD MANURE PONDS TO CAPTURE THAT MANEUVER- SO WE CAN PUT THAT BACK ON THE FIELD THIS FERTILIZER THIS WAS PRIOR TO THE CLEAN WATER ACT- SO MY DAD AND HIM BUILT THOSE YOU KNOW WITH THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT WE ARE WE ARE VERY LUCKY THAT WE HAVE. THE CLAY PAN THERE THAT THAT WE CAN PRESERVE THOSE THE BOTTOM THOSE PAWNS WITHOUT LEAKAGE INTO THE WATER TABLE- I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT THAT. TO MILK THE MEDICARE AT THE LAND COULD. COULD HANDLE- AND THAT THAT LAND WOULD GIVE BACK TO YOU AND- MOVING THROUGH. OUR GRANTS BE AROUND MY GRANDFATHER WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND THEN PARTNERS WITH MY DAD FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS. I FINALLY BOUGHT THE BUSINESS OUT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND RUN IT MYSELF. I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED FOR PROGRAMS THAT WERE OUT THERE. TO HELP THE DAIRY INDUSTRY- IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES WE DID A THREE NINETEEN H. GRANT- THROUGH THE WATER BOARD AND ACTUALLY WITH THE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT. TO PUT A FERTIGATION SYSTEM AND WE WERE ABLE TO PUT A- PUMP ON ONE OF OUR MANY WERE PAWNS AND WE- WE INJECT THAT MANY WERE INTERROGATION SYSTEM. WE SAW A HUGE INCREASE IN A PRODUCTION OF OUR SILAGE FIELDS BY DOING THAT THAT PLANT GETTING AT THE RIGHT TIME- OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IS I WAS THE FIRST DAIRY. IN THE UNITED STATES. TO DO A NUTRIENT OFFSET PROJECT FOR THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA- WE HAVE BEEN A PARTNER WITH CITY OF SANTA ROSA FOR OVER FORTY YEARS UTILIZING THEIR RECLAIMED WASTEWATER TO IRRIGATE. THEY WERE RUNNING INTO SOME. PROBLEMS WITH NITROGEN PHOSPHOROUS WITH THE WATER BOARD AND THEY CAME TO ME AND THEY SPEND ABOUT A HUNDRED. AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- ON A PROJECT OF TAKING CATTLE ACTUALLY CREATING A CONCRETE WALKWAY. THROUGH AN AREA THAT COULD POSSIBLY RUN OFF THE FARM AND WE CHANGED TO MAN OR MANAGEMENT- PRACTICES ALSO- WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE- THE DIGEST ARE PROJECTS THAT WERE BEING DONE IN THE VALLEY. WE ALL KNEW IN OUR AREA THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T BENEFIT THE SMALLER DAIRIES- SO BUNCH OF US KIND OF GOT TOGETHER AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROJECTS AND WE MET. PROBABLY FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS TALKING ABOUT WHAT WOULD WORK- I DO APPRECIATE- SECRETARY ROSS FOR REACHING OUT AND REALLY LISTENING TO THE GROUPS THAT THAT CAME TO HER ABOUT THIS AND I APPRECIATE THAT COMMITTEE FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH THESE BUT- IT HAS BEEN A HUGE HELP TO US SO. WE HAVE AN AIR PROJECT- WE ARE PROBABLY ABOUT FORTY FIVE DAYS ABOUT AWAY FROM BEING FINISHED- WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN- INPUT AUTOMATIC SCRAPERS AND A FREE STILLBORN. WHICH WILL THEN GO TO A SCHOOL SMALL SUMP PUMP THE PUMP THROUGH A SEPARATOR. AND WE WILL SEPARATE THAT MANEUVER AND REUSE IT IS BETTING SO IT'S- IT'S GONNA TAKE- VIA A LABOR SAVINGS FOR US IT'S GOING TO BE. AN INPUT SAVINGS WERE WE WERE BUYING WASHED RIVER SAND- WILL BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT MANEUVER BACK. PLUS THE AMOUNT OF METHANE AND- DIESEL THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY REDUCING CARBON GO AND- WITH THAT MANURE I ALSO BE ABLE TO- COMPOST SOME OF MY MEN WHO WERE ON SITE. AND UTILIZE THAT BACK ONTO OUR PROPERTY TO WHERE WE'VE JUST SPREAD IT AS A US DRIVE WITH A MAN WHO WERE- THAT PROJECT HAS BEEN. SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN REALLY GREAT- IT WAS TOUGH TO GET INTO. IT WAS- I THINK IF I DIDN'T HAVE UC EXTENSION FOR THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD HAVE REALLY. GOT THE RIGHT APPLICATION INTO TO RECEIVE THAT GRANT- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING MOVING FORWARD THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT I HEARD- SECRETARY ROSS TALK ABOUT THAT BUT- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE FARMING COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE WHEN WE GO INTO THESE GRANTS- THE TOUGHEST THINGS I TOLD- SOMEONE RIVAS WHEN HE WAS THERE IS. THE WAY THE MONEY IS PAID OUT WE ARE ABLE TO- LET. APPLY FOR MONEY BACK WITH INVOICES QUARTERLY- IT'S BEEN GREAT IF WE'VE HAD A BIG EXPENDITURE THEY SAID GO AHEAD AND SEND THE MEN BUT- I'M BANKROLLING THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PROJECT. I'VE HAD TO TAKE OUT A LOAN I ACTUALLY WENT INTO MY CREDIT LINE AND SO I'M PAYING INTEREST ON THAT AND- THE ONE THING I DO HAVE TO- REALLY SAVES. THE LADY AT- THAT I HAS BEEN WORKING ON MY PROJECT HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL THE SUPPORT THERE TO GET IT BACK TO WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN GETTING OUR MONEY. BETWEEN THREE TO FIVE WEEKS WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY IT WAS FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY DAYS- THE OTHER PROJECT I HAVE GOING ON I WAS ACCEPTED LAST YEAR FOR HEALTHY SOILS PROJECT- THAT ONE HAS BEEN. NOT THE WAY I REALLY EXPECTED IT WE WERE TOLD WE WOULD THAT WE- WERE ACCEPTED. FOR FIVE MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD BEFORE WE GOT PAPERWORK TO SIGN STILL ANOTHER COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE WE GOT THE OK TO MOVE AHEAD AND THEN- YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS DONE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. AND THIS WAS MID NOVEMBER IF WE WOULD'VE HAD A- THE WINTER IN SONOMA COUNTY LIKE WE SHOULD OF THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD HAVE GOT IT DONE BUT WE GOT ON IT WE GOT OUR SEED IN THE GROUND WE'VE GOT OUR PICTURES MY DAUGHTER PUT TOGETHER A TEN PAGE- REPORT SENATE. AND THEY SAID WELL THAT'S THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WE WANT THIS IS WHAT WE WANT NOW I'M HEARING THAT MAY NOT SEEN IN MY MONEY FOR. UNTIL AFTER I RAISE THEM THE GROUND. I'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT THERE SITTING IN SEAT COSTING COMPARABLE COST RIGHT NOW. SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE. TOUGH FOR THE FORMER- BUT I STILL THINK THESE PROJECTS. NEED TO HAPPEN AND OR AND YOU KNOW I REALLY. THANK THE STATE FOR REACHING OUT DOING THESE THINGS- YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY. THAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER OR THE DAIRY WE ARE PRICE TAKERS WE DON'T GET CENTER PRICE. PRICES SET BY THE FEDERAL MARKETING ORDER SO IT'S REALLY TOUGH WHEN. LEGISLATORS SUCH AS YOURSELVES AND AIR QUALITY BOARD WATER BOARDS DECIDE TO BRING ON NEW REGULATIONS WITH COSTS TO US. OUR STATE WATER QUALITY BOARD. DAIRY PERMITS FOR WHAT. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHY BUT ITS COST IS IT ON SO IT'S JUST GOING TO YOU KNOW AS- AS JASON SAID IT'S GETTING INTO OUR BOTTOM LINE- I THINK ONE THING THAT. REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD NEW REGULATIONS IS WE NEED TO HAVE EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE TOGETHER- COMPOST AS WE HEARD IS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MAJOR. THINGS THAT WE NEED TO PUT ON A GROUND FOR CARBON SEQUESTERING THERE WAS A AN AIR QUALITY BILL THAT GOT SHOT DOWN FINALLY BUT GOING THROUGH THAT WAS GOING TO REALLY AFFECT OUR COMPOST FACILITIES. AND IF WE CAN'T HAVE THOSE COMPOST FACILITIES CLOSE HOW ARE WE GOING TO GENERATE THAT COMPOST TO BE ABLE TO PUT ON ALL THESE LANDS. IT'S CRAZY TO HAUL COMPOST FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY ANDERSON ON ACCOUNT OF THE FOOTPRINT ALONE IN THE TRUCKING. IS MORE THAN WHAT WE'RE WE'RE STARTING AS QUAESTOR SO I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME SOME OTHER PROGRAMS THAT. AS I SAID EARLIER I AM I AM I ONE OF THOSE GUYS HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED TO THE FUTURE MAYBE I STICK MY NECK OUT YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR SOMETIMES WHEN I GET INVOLVED IN SOME OF THESE PROJECTS BUT- I'VE BEEN YOU KNOW REALLY HAPPY WITH WITH WHAT'S GOING ON- ONE OTHER QUICK ONE WAS WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT FOR GRAZING AND FIRE RESILIENCE- AS I SAID I WOULD. REYES A HUNDRED FORTY ACRES THAT I RENT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOW MANY OF YOU HIRE A MANAGER TO MANAGE THE LAND OR TO MANAGER PROJECT AND ASKED THEM TO PAY YOU. THE PROPERTY IS OWNED BY THE STATE. IT'S MOSTLY MANAGED BY STATE ON THE MANAGEMENT TOOL I SHOULD BE AT LEAST GETTING IT FOR NOTHING OR IF NOT GETTING PAID I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT. WITH THE FARMING COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY IN GRAZING- IS REACHING OUT TO THOSE IN PAIN FOR THOSE TYPE OF PRACTICES. IN SPACE CARBON SEQUESTERED IT'S ALL THERE WE'VE BEEN DOING THESE THINGS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. AND THE ONLY OTHER WAY TO GO BACK IS GO BACK TO TOWN AND START TEARING HOUSES OUTPUT AND PASTURE AND THINGS BACK AND WE KNOW WE CAN'T DO THAT. SO REALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP AGRICULTURE INVOLVED KEEP AGRICULTURE. GROWING AND PROFITABLE THERE HAS TO BE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DO- TO HELP BACK CONTINUE TO DO WHAT WE'RE DOING IF NOT DO MORE- I. WE HAVE TRIED SOME NO TILL SEEDING IT IS REALLY SEEM TO WORK AND YOU KNOW ONE OF OUR GOALS IS PROBABLY MOVING FARTHER AWAY FROM TILL THE LAND TO NO TILL FOR OUR SILAGE CROPS PASTURE HAS REALLY SEEM TO WORK OUT VERY WELL- IT'S JUST I THINK. SOME OF IT IS THE OLD SCHOOL GUYS- DON'T WANT TO CHANGE TO THE NEW SCHOOL. BUT I THINK IT'S THAT THE NUMBERS ARE THERE AND THE AVAILABILITY AND YOU KNOW AND THOSE THINGS ARE. ARE ABLE TO BE DONE- I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT ALL I REALLY HAVE ON. ON THAT I THINK MY THE BEST THING FOR ME IS QUESTIONS AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT US INTO THE OTHER PARTS OF PANEL COULD COULD ANSWER UNTESTED GOLD PALM REALLY APPRECIATE PRESENTATION AND- YOU KNOW- YOUR CANDID RESPONSES TO. YOU KNOW YOUR EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I REALLY ENJOYED ABOUT MY VISIT TO- YOUR DAIRY IS YOU'RE JUST A STRAIGHT SHOOTER AND YOU KNOW YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THE OPPORTUNITIES AND SO CERTAINLY I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR. THE COMMITTEE TO YOU KNOW. HERE THE EXPERIENCE OF THANK YOU DOUG. AND SO WITH THAT OPEN IT UP TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. FOR MEMBERS OF OUR PANEL AND YOU CAN STAY THERE LIKE THAT YEAH. BYE SHE MATHIS. THE FIRST OWNER THANK YOU FOR. MAKING THE TRIP- I KNOW ITS- IT'S A LOT HARDER WHEN YOU'RE SMALL DAIRY VERSUS BIG VERY WITH THOUSANDS ACCOUNTS AND- A LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUME THAT EVERYBODY'S ON THE LARGE SCALE. AND DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENT TPES OF THAT ARE OUT THERE HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE DRIVE PRACTICE AND KEEP EVERYTHING ON THERE SO I APPRECIATE YOU HIGHLIGHTING THAT. TODAY BECAUSE IT IS A SEPARATE PROCESS- IT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS AND FIGHTS WE FED UP HERE FOR YEARS- TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE- MY BIGGEST QUESTION IN IN THIS FRANKLY IS FOR ALL THE PANELISTS CAN YOU ALL DIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE. INTO THE- ADDED. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. FOR APPLYING FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT GRANTS AND EVERYTHING THAT KEEPS COMING DOWN FROM THE STATE BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S- IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE. BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO- LIKE YOU'D MENTIONED GOING THROUGH- DAVIS TO GET HELP WITH IT BUT NOT EVERYBODY HAS THOSE CAPABILITIES NOT EVERYBODY. KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT- IN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE TO STEP OUT. FROM RUNNING YOUR DAIRY IN MANAGING THAT TO GO SIT DOWN AND FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. WHO'S GOING AROUND THE FARM. AND SO IF YOU ALL COULD SHARE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH THAT- IT AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM ALL THE PANELISTS IF. TO THE CHAIR ABSOLUTELY. BUT I THINK- YOU KNOW THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS VERY LUCKY WITH- WE DO HAVE A NEW- DAIRY SPECIALIST AND THREE UC EXTENSION IN OUR AREA. SO WE HAD BEEN A COUPLE MEETINGS AND I TALKED ABOUT THE PROJECT THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT AND SHE DID. STEP UP AND HELP ME THEY ACTUALLY HAD SOME MONEY IN THEIR BUDGET THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO- HELP THAT OUT- WE HAVE A VERY ACTIVE- RCD. HELLO THREE GROUPS IN SONOMA MARIN COUNTY THREE RCTS THAT- YOU KNOW HAVE. ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR US BUT THERE IS SOME COST AND YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAVE TO PUT IT IN THEIR BUDGET ALSO. SO- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT IN THE GRAND IF THERE'S THE WAY THAT YOU CAN THROW SOME YOU KNOW TECHNICAL SUPPORT IN AT GRANDPA. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE REAL CAREFUL THERE TOO BECAUSE OUR OUR- TECHNICAL GROUPS OUT THERE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CHARGE YOU KNOW WAY TOO MUCH MONEY TO DO THIS- CELL BUT IT IS IT IS IT WAS A- VERY I MEAN I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE REDUCTIONS. THAT WE WERE GOING TO DO. BECAUSE I MEAN I HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION AND GO TO SCHOOL AND HAVE ALL THAT YOU KNOW. GO TO COLLEGE AND THIS AND THAT BUT- WITH THEIR ABILITY AND THEIR EXPERTISE IT WAS REAL THAT WAS. MADE MY- MY CHANCES OF YOU KNOW GETTING THE GRANT A LOT BETTER SO I REALLY THINK THOSE ARE THINGS. THAT NEED TO BE. PART OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT COME FROM THE STATE BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALLER GROWERS IN OUR AREA. THAT ARE GOING TO NEED THAT JUST LIKE YOU SAID THEY'RE DOING THE WORK THEIR SELVES. THEY MAY EVEN BE. DOING THAT YOU KNOW FROM. AFTER WORK AND THEY'RE GONNA NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND HARPER SAYS YOU KNOW THE SPECIALTY CROPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I DID- I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT THAT SECRETARY ROSS TALKED ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW FOR. KIND OF TRICKLING DOWN INTO THE INTO THE SPECIALTY CROPS ALSO. pEXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN A NEW TOUCH ON IT. IT'S WE SEEM TO FORGET. UP HERE UNDER THE DOME IN SACRAMENTO ABOUT THE SMALLER. FAMILY FARMER. AND WHAT THOSE EXPERIENCES ARE LIKE BECAUSE WE THINK OF. YOU KNOWS AGAS IS BEING. A GIANT NORMAN NUMIS- YOU KNOW COMMODITY- VERSUS ALL THE FAMILY FARMS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR GENERATION AFTER GENERATION AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SHARING I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO ALL THE PANELISTS AND NOT. SHOOT TOO MUCH TIME. I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT FAMILY FARMERS AND SMALL FARMS. A LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE TODAY IS A LOT OF THE SMALL FARMS ARE BEING HANDED DOWN. BUT THEY'RE REALLY NOT MAKING MANY AND TRUTHFULLY A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW THAT HAVE SMALL ALMOND OPERATIONS. THEY HAVE SIDE JOBS THAT ACTUALLY BE THE FAMILY AND THE THING IS THEY WANT TO KEEP THAT THAT LAND THAT'S A PART OF THE FAMILY. SO KEEP IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT REALLY PAYING THE BILLS- I MEAN LOOK AT JASON YES A PSYCHIC. SO THE- OKAY. I WANNA HEAR FROM JASON TO YEAH I MEAN IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH US THE- JUST THE PROCESS THAT YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH IN IN A PLAYOFF. I OR OR YOU'RE YOU KNOW OF OTHER FRIENDS THEY THEY YOU FARM WITH A I KNOW A HEALTHY SOILS WHEN MY COUSIN TO THE HEALTHY SOILS ONE AND IT WAS. I MEAN. BASICALLY THAT WAS SOMEBODY'S JOB. TO ACTUALLY PUT THAT GRANT THAT THE LARGER YOU ARE THE OPERATION THE MORE RESOURCES YOU HAVE. TO ACTUALLY PUT THAT APPLICATION TOGETHER I'M- I'M STILL GOING TO TRY AND DO IT BUT YES IT'S VERY TIME CONSUMING BECAUSE IT'S- AT YOU KNOW. I NEED TO BE ON THE TRACTOR ALL DAY WORKING OR DOING WHATEVER IT IS I'M DOING THAT DAY IN THE FIELD. SO THAT'S WHAT MY NIGHTS ARE SPENT DOING. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW I HAVE A LOT GOING ON. BUT I AM ABLE TO GET TO THAT BUT IT'S ACTUALLY IT IS REALLY HARD. IT'S A LOT OF WORK THEIR RESOURCES ONE THOUGH BOARD WENT FOR- THE WHOLE ORCHARD RECYCLING THAT WAS A BAD THAT ONE WAS DEFINITELY DO IT WILL BE NICE IF THEY WERE MORE LIKE THAT ONE. SO MAYBE IT MAYBE USE THAT ONE AS A MODEL. I MEAN IN THE SMALL GUYS THEY'RE THE ONES WHO NEED IT THE MOST THEY REALLY ARE. ONE MORE. IS JASON STONE IS THAT ME YEP- YEAH SO I HAVE A SIDE JOB AS WELL- AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I HAD I KNOWN- YEAH I GUESS THE ECONOMIC PRESSURES OF OPERATING- FRUIT PRODUCTION I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SCARED TO GET INVOLVED BUT I JUMPED IN BECAUSE IT WAS ROMANTIC AND ALSO BECAUSE THE TREES WERE ALREADY HERE WHEN I MOVED IN SO I STARTED TO INTERACT WITH THE TREES AND WHICH- WHICH THEN MADE ME. QUESTION HOW DO THE SMALL FARMS DO IT YOU KNOW IF I'M GOING ORGANIC AND I HAVE MY CERTIFICATIONS AT MY FOOD AND SAFETY I'M WORKING WITH THE- NATURAL- CONSERVATION- EFFORTS. IT IS SO BUSY AND I'M PUTTING SO MUCH INPUT INTO IT AND THERE'S LITTLE RETURN- IT FORCED ME TO LOOKING TO SPECIALTY CROPS INTO DIVERSIFIED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE MY MENTOR FARMERS OUT HERE TOLD ME TO DO- THEY SAID IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SURVIVE YOU. YOU YOU NEED TO DIVERSIFY AND- THINK OF THIS IN IN THE BIG PICTURE- SO LIKE I SAID I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD I KNOWN HOW HOW VERY VERY CHALLENGING THIS IS A FIGHT WOULD HAVE DONE IT YET I'M SO GLAD I DID BECAUSE NOW I FEEL LIKE WE CAN SERVE AS A MODEL AND HOPEFULLY IN ROLE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE INTO AGRICULTURE. IS WHAT I'VE SEEN ESPECIALLY WITH A SMALL FAMILY FARMS IN MY AREA IS THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH YOUNG PEOPLE TO REPLACE THE OLDER FARMERS WHO WILL BE RETIRING THIS GENERATION SO THERE NEEDS TO BE AND SENATE THERE NEED TO BE LAND THERE NEEDS TO BE- RETURN ON THE CROP- JUST. MORE ENCOURAGING- PROGRAMS I AM VERY LUCKY THAT I DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON GRANTS AND BANK LOANS TO DO THIS BUT- THIS YEAR WAS REALLY HARD BECAUSE ALL OF MY OTHER SIDE GIGS WERE CANCELLED YOU KNOW AS AS WE MANY OF US MANY OF US HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE- SO I LOOKED I LOOKED EVEN CLOSER AT MY FRUIT PRODUCTION AND HOW WE COULD. FIND MORE BENEFITS IN IN BEING HERE. COULD I JUST GIVE YOU ONE QUICK YEAH THE THREE OF US OF KIND OF TALK ABOUT SMALL FARMS AND AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW THAT IN YOUR DISTRICT WE HAVE A LOT OF A LOT OF LARGE DAIRIES. I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY EASIER FOR THEM. THEN IT IS FOR THE SMALL FOR. THEM THEY'RE LOOKING AT LARGER NUMBERS THEY'RE LOOKING AT LARGER REDUCTIONS. CAN'T WE CAN'T. FORGET ABOUT IT SHOULD BE THERE IS THERE YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THOSE BIG REDUCTIONS. THAT WE NEED IS A STATE IN SOME OF OUR OR BIGGER. EXACTLY THREE THOUSAND G. I'M JUST TELLING THEIR USERS ARE STILL. HAND SOMETHING THAT. IS YOU KNOW REALLY IT'S A LOT SIMILAR THROUGHOUT. THE STATE JUST A DIFFERENT SCALE. AND I HAD IN THE CAN'T WE CAN'T CURE ALL THESE THINGS TO THE SMALL FORM IT'S GREAT. THAT THE SMALL THAT IT'S AVAILABLE FOR THE SMALL FARMS AND MAYBE THERE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE MORE TECHNICAL SUPPORT ON- BUT- YOU KNOW WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT THE LARGER THE DAIRY INDUSTRY ITSELF. NO AT ABSOLUTELY I THINK- WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS IS LIKE JASON MENTIONED I MEAN YOU YOU KNOW GOING TO. DO ON A FARM OR A RANCH THINKING YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SPEND 80% OF YOUR TIME DOING ADMINISTRATIVE WORK. THANK YOU. EITHER WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR SOME THE MEMBER WOULD. YEAH AND ACTUALLY I PROBABLY SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY HERE- FIRST FALL. MISTER BRADLEY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR THE PRACTICES THAT YOU'RE OING AND THE PERSEVERANCE AND- THAT YOU DO I KNOW- FROM MEETING WITH OTHER DAIRY AND DAIRY MEN AND THEIR- PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS THAT THAT THAT IT'S TOUGH IT'S REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT. I WAS CURIOUS I AM VERY CURIOUS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU BROUGHT UP WAS THE FACT THAT- YOU YOU PAY THE STATE TO GRAZE. THEIR LAND AND EDWARDS YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF MANAGEMENT ROUGHLY WHAT IS THE COST ON THAT DO YOU HAVE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TODAY THAT'S FINE I'M BUT RIGHT HERE IN ACTUALLY IT THAT THE TOUGHEST PART ABOUT THAT WAS- ORIGINALLY WHEN IT WHEN IT STARTED I HAD A- GRAYSON AGREEMENT WITH THEM. AND SOMETHING WENT. HOW KATHY WALTERS HERE AT THE STATE AND- WE HAD TO PUT IT ALL OUT TO BID. SO HERE I AM A DERRY MAN THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH THE BID PROCESS OF A STATE BID PROCESS. GO THROUGH WALKING THROUGH. I THINK THE APPLICATION WAS TWENTY. ABOUT TWENTY PAGES. THREE MILLION DOLLAR LIABILITY INSURANCE YOU KNOW I MEAN IT COPIES SO THERE'S- SO WHEN I DID IT WHERE I CAME OUT. OKAY WAS BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY ONE. IN THE WATER SO I DID IT PRETTY CHEAP. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK SOME OF IT'S PROBABLY. IN THAT. FIFTY THE FIFTY TO SIXTY DOLLARS PER HEAD OF ANIMALYOU KNOW ON THAT ACRE SO YOU USE I MEAN SO SOMEWHERE IN. SOMEWHERE PRO I MEAN I'M THE FOR RITUAL YOU FIRST YEAR THAT I DID IT- THE FIRST ONE I WENT THROUGH I WAS PAY AND- FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE YEAR FOR A HUNDRED FORTY ACRES. BUT I ONLY GET THAT. FROM FEBRUARY THROUGH JUNE BECAUSE OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES I CAN ONLY GRAYSON CERTAIN TIMES. SO YOU KNOW IT IT IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHO SHOWS UP TO BED THAT THAT WAY AND- THE LIKE SAID THOSE THE SECOND ROUND THROUGH THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE OF THE WACHTER SO I KNEW I WAS THE ONLY ONE VIDEO THEY DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SAY NO BUT THEY THEY ACCEPTED AND I HAVE IT DOWN TO RIGHT NOW I THINK I'M PAYING RIGHT AROUND A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THAT LAND FOR YOU KNOW I GET FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS T'S A THREE YEAR. IT'S A THREE YEAR LEASE I HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW TWO HUNDRED SOMETHING DAYS PRIOR AND I HAVE TWO ONE YEAR OPTIONS. BUT IT IS YOU KNOW IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S KIND OF CUMBERSOME TO GO THROUGH. IF AND- THE YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME OF THESE PLACES HAVE. NO CROWDS NO INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY HAVE WATER. WE HAVE IT THERE SEVENTY TWO ACRES. THAT HAS BEEN SITTING THERE NOW FOR. OVER TEN YEARS NOTHING'S BEEN ON IT BECAUSE THERE'S NO WATER. AND THEY HAD A FARMER THAT WAS GRAYSON AT ALL I HAD TO DO WAS OPEN THE GATE. WHEN HE WHEN ORGANIC THE STATE WOULD NOT LET THAT GET THAT GROUND BE CERTIFIED ORGANIC SO NOW IT'S CITY. SO THOSE ARE YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES IN IT BUT- YOU KNOW JUST TO ME IT'S REALLY TOUGH WHEN YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT. HAS BEEN GIFTED TO THE STATE THERE WAS AN ENDOWMENT FUND WITH THESE MITIGATION BANKS. AND NOW AS I LEE SAID I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE FENCES BECAUSE THEN DOWN THE MONEY'S GONE. WHERE DID IT GO ON THE MATTER FIVE YEARS BUT IT'S GONE- I'M ALSO STRUCK BY- LISTENING TO YOU TALK AND- THE STRUCK BY THE DIFFERENCES. I MEAN THERE THERE'S CLEAR DIFFERENCE WITH AND I AM- AGRICULTURE AND ALMONDS AND WHAT CHASENS DOING VERY VERY DIFFERENT YEAH A LOT OF INTERACTION WITH A LOT OF THE CITY SAME THE SAME AGENCIES. AND YOU KNOW AND- AND ALL I'LL JUST SAY- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PROGRAMS WHERE YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET FREE RESOURCES FROM THE STATE YOU HAVE TO DO THE WORK AND APPLY TO GET IT YOU KNOW GET THE MONEY BACK- YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT- IT'S- AND THAT MAKES IT. THAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE CHALLENGING WE SEE THAT WITH THAT STATION MANAGEMENT FORESTRY WHERE PEOPLE THE SEAFOOD- PROGRAM WHERE YOU YOU DO THE WORK AND THEN YOU CAN YOU APPLY TO GET THE MONEY BACK IT MIGHT BE THREE FOUR FIVE SIX MONTHS AND- IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT CASH YOU YOU TO PUT OUT THE FIRST PLACE YOU CAN'T DO IT SO. SO YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT TO LINES OF CREDIT SO I APPLAUD YOU. FOR THE EXTRA STEPS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO- IN ADDITION TO THE KIND OF WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING SO- BUT I CAN SEE THAT IT'S CHALLENGING AND IN MY DISTRICT- MOST OF THE FARMS ARE SMALL FARMS WITH THEIR DAIRIES OR- A CATTLE OR OR OTHER KINDS OF CROPS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE ALMOST ALL SMALL ALL SMALL AND SO- YOU KNOW IT'S CHALLENGE. IT'S CHALLENGING OUT THERE SO- I DO QUESTION FOR JASON IF HE'S IF HE'S STILL THERE. I HOPE WE GET RUN OFF TO A GIG. BUT I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU IF YOU DID- EXTRA YET. SO I AM- ABOUT THE CHOICE OF CROPS THAT YOU DID I MEAN YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT YOU START WITH AVOCADOS NOW YOU'RE GROWING COFFEE- AND BANANAS- IS THE WHAT IS THAT WHEN YOU SEEN AS THE CO BENEFITS OF THAT COMBINATION OF CROPS TO YOUR TO YOUR LAND- AND WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR LIKE WATER CONSUMPTION AND WAS IT. WAS IT LOOKED LIKE FROM YOU'VE SEEN THIS NOW BECAUSE YOU'VE YOU'VE LIVED IT WOULDN'T WOULDN'T WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE DIFFERENCES- VERT THEN VERSUS NOW. WELL WE'RE STILL SEEING- MORE CROP PRODUCTION WITH NOT THAT MUCH EXTRA INPUT IN WATER AND EVEN LABOR BECAUSE OP ALWAYS REQUIRE FEEDING. OUR SEASONALLY AND PRUNING YEARLY WHICH LEFT US A LOT OF TIME- TRY PRIOR TO HAVING THIS SORT OF AGRO FOREST IS VERY DIVERSE AND DANCE LANDSCAPE- I COULD AFFORD TO BE MORE OF AN ABSENTEE FARMER AS MANY GENTLEMAN FARMS AND SMALL FARM FAMILY FARMS CAN DO- BUT I WANTED TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN IN BETWEEN ALL OF THE AVOCADO TREES. IS A RELATIVELY LARGE AMOUNT OF REAL ESTATE SO WE- I CHOSE THE SPECIALTY CROPS OF COFFEE AND BANANAS- FOR THE LOCAL ASPECT BECAUSE COFFEE. HAS NEVER BEEN GROWN ON THE MAINLAND UNITED STATES BEFORE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPORTANT SO I WANTED TO ENCOURAGE AND PROMOTE LOCAL. PRODUCE AND BANANAS THE SAME WAY ARE. YOU WE JUST WE CAN'T BY LOCAL BANANA AT THE GROCERY STORE SO I WANTED TO ADD SOME MORE LOCAL VALUE TO RIGHT HERE AND REDUCE. I WOULD SAY MY CARBON FOOTPRINT IN MINE IMPORTING OF COFFEE AND BANANAS LET'S SAY. SO ADDING IT INTO OUR PROGRAM IT ALLOWED TO- MY STAFF WHO WHO'S HERE TO JUST CONTINUE TO FLY ME LABOR IS PROBABLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE THING THAT HAS CHANGED- BUT- BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SO DENSE AND KIND OF SHARING THE IRRIGATION SYSTEM- WE'RE NOT USING THAT MUCH MORE WATER IN YET WE HAVE. FOUR THOUSAND MORE TREES THAN WE STARTED WITH- SO THEY WERE REALLY A LOT OF BENEFITS- WE HAD SOME AREAS THAT HAD SOME EROSION PROBLEMS PRIOR TO OUR MORE AGGRESSIVE PLANTING AND NOW WE'RE MORE OF A SPONGE BECAUSE AS THE AS IT RAINS WE CAN COLLECT THAT WATER. SO ARE I FEEL LIKE OUR ENVIRONMENT HAS DEFINITELY CHANGED THE MICRO CLIMATES ON OUR VARIOUS LOPES FROM THE TOP TO THE TO THE LOWER MEADOW. ALL OF THOSE. HAVE CHANGED IN WAYS BECAUSE OF THE MORE VEGETATION THAT WE'VE ADDED. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO SAY IT'S IT IS A SMALL WORLD MY SON WORKS FOR FRENCH. HE MIDDLE THE MIDDLE SOME OF YOUR COFFEE YESTERDAY WONDERFUL HELLO IT'S A VERY SMALL WORLD AND- HE'S A BIG HE'S A BIG FAN OF YOUR COFFEE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YU MUSIC BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I GOT TO ASK ABOUT THAT BUT- BUT HE'S A BIG FAN OF YOUR COFFEE. I THINK IT WILL. BEGIN IN COFFEE SHOPS SO I'VE I'VE HAD A LOVE A COPY FOR A LONG TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU HEY JASON- YOU. I WOULD I AT THE CHEMICAL ON THE TWO ARE YOUR RANCH YOU ALSO HAD- A COVER CROP. RIGHT YES- AND WE'VE DONE THAT WE'VE BEEN EDUCATING OURSELVES IN BENEFICIAL WEEKS BASICALLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE CONVENTIONAL FARMS RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET THAT WILL COME AND SPRAYED AROUND UP ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR SO THEY HAVE NO REASON THEY DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT BUT THERE ARE SO MANY BENEFICIAL- NATURALLY OCCURRING WEEDS LIKE STINGING NETTLE AND- FOR EXAMPLE AND WE'VE- ALSO GONE AN EXTRA MILE TO. I SEE. A RED CLOVER AND- AND VARIOUS SPECIES OF COVER CROPS THAT WILL HOPEFULLY DOMINATE THE WEEDS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PULLING. AND IT JUST CONTINUES TO ADD VEGETATION TO. THE SOIL WHICH DOES GO HAND IN HAND ALSO WE'LL ALL GROUND SHOULD HAVE VEGETATION. ON IT COVER CROP OR PERENNIAL TREE IT SHOULD NEVER BE LEFT FALLOW FOR TOO LONG SO WE'VE WE'VE ALSO BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH THAT. IT'S GOING WELL. THAT'S GREAT- I APPRECIATE YOU EXPLAIN THAT THANK YOU- I KNOW THERE WAS- A QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER- BELBUCA. THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN- THIS IS MORE COMMON A JUST I. SETBACK YOUR AND JUST LISTEN TO ALL THREE OF YOU GUYS YOU GUYS ARE COMING FROM ALL DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA AND I APPRECIATE- YOUR PRESENTATION- ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW HEARING THAT YOUR YOUR YOUR KIDS ARE TAKING ON THE NEXT GENERATION. AND THAT'S ONE THING I HEAR MORE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN AROUND ASK FOR A LONG TIME YOU KNOW- NEVER EVER HAVE I BEEN HEARING THAT MORE THAT FOLKS ARE LIKE. AWESOME GIVEN THE SAP YOU KNOW I JUST CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE YOU KNOW AND IT'S- THE COST IS TOO EXPENSIVE AND- AND I HATE IT WHEN YOU KNOW ANOTHER FARMER WILL GIVE IT TO. A DEVELOPER RIGHT BECAUSE HERE WE ARE TRYING TO PROTECT THE GREEN BELT WE'RE TRYING TO. CREATE THE NEXT AG FOLKS AS MY BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE MAG VENTURE IN OUR IN OUR DISTRICT AND SUPPORTING THAT- YEAH THERE'S A PRISON THAT. IS THAT SHUT DOWN THAT THEY HAVEN'T TAG- FACILITY THEY WERE TRYING TO EVEN PROTECT THAT RIGHT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME TYPE OF A- VOCATIONAL TRAINING THERE FOR THE FOR THE NEXT- AG. COMMUNITY. MIKE IT IS NOT A QUESTION I'M JUST AND JUST AS I WAS SITTING HERE THINKING THAT MY STAFF THAT LITERALLY IN THE DISTRICT HAS LIKE ALL HANDS ON DECK WHEN IT COMES TO EDT H. ISSUES AND OUR OUR- BUSINESS GRANTS RIGHT. AND WHAT I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNOR WHEN WE WERE LIVE IN AND LISTENING TO SOME OF THE RECIPIENTS THAT RECEIVED IT. BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN FOLKS THAT RECEIVED THE GRAPH. AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW. MANY TIMES HAVE I APPLIED FOR A GRANT. IN AND ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GET IT BECAUSE IT'S IT ALMOST TAKES ABOUT SCIENCE TO GET THROUGH THIS YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE JUST BAIL OR TO SAY FORGET AND I CAN EVEN DO THIS. BUT PER. RUN KNEES THE GOVERNOR REALLY DID YOU KNOW HIT A HOME RUN BECAUSE HE HE MADE IT SIMPLE HE MADE IT EASIER HE MADE IT. SO THAT THAT THAT FOLKS. ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TIMES THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH MADE IT EASIER SAID BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE A LOT OF STRESS ON YOU. YOU KNOW YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO ALWAYS FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE- YOU KNOW THE SCREWBALL THEY WERE TRYING TO THROW DO YOU GUYS YOU KNOW TRYING TO FIGURE HOW YOU GUYS CAN HIT THAT. AND- YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT WE'RE JUST WE SHOULD JUST BE THROWING YOU JUST A STRAIGHT BALL YOU KNOW DOWN THE LINE SO THAT YOU GUYS CAN REALLY SEE THIS AND I. YOU KNOW AS I SIT HERE AND I THINK ABOUT WHEN MY STUFF TO DO IN OUR COMMUNITY I THINK THAT. YOUR HUMONGOUS PART YOU KNOW OF ART OF OUR ECONOMY. YOU KNOW THREE OUT OF EVERY FIVE JOBS ARE AG RELATED. YOU KNOW AND I KEEP SAYING THAT BUT I KEEP THINKING THAT. YOU KNOW ARE THOSE STATISTICS CORRECT I MEAN ARE THERE STATISTICS TRYING TO GO DOWN. AND I JUST WANTED TO THE COMMENT WAS JUST SAYING THANK YOU GUYS FOR ALL FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WITHOUT YOUR SAY SO WITHOUT YOUR- YOU'RE COMING HERE. TO I SEE PET. YOU EDUCATE US OF WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GOING THROUGH- IS REASON WHY YOU KNOW ALL OF US HERE. ARE ARE YOU KNOW. ON THIS COMMITTEE TO TRY TO LISTEN AND DO WHAT'S BEST SO. I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU GUYS THANK YOU GUYS FOR TAKING THE TIME THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU SOME NUMBERS TO BE ABLE TO OUR- SOME MEMBER LEVINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- I REALLY ENJOYED HEARING JASON'S STORY- PARTICULARLY. BECAUSE I THINK THE PERCEPTION IS PEOPLE CAN MY GOING TO FARMING PARTICULAR THEIR SUCCESS THE SUCCESSFUL IN ONE INDUSTRY AND DO IT MAYBE FOR FUN AND NOT WITH A BUSINESS MENTALITY OF. ONE HOW DO YOU DO DO SOME WITH A BOTTOM LINE BUT ALSO. CO BENEFITS AS WELL AND THE NEED FOR- FOR HAVING ALTERNATIVE REVENUE STREAMS THANK THAT'S A FASCINATING ISSUE FOR US TO DEAL WITH AND THE RISK THAT YOU TOOK IN. THINKING MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A GO OUT OF BANANAS AND WE CAN'T HAVE A GO AND IT COULD BE A MARKET. FOR COFFEE AND- YOU KNOW QUOTE WHAT'S THAT RECEPTION BEEN LIKE AS YOU'RE INTRODUCING WHAT REALLY IS IF YOU SET UP A FIRST TIME CROP IN CALIFORNIA. THIS THIS WILL. DESIRE TO HAVE. SOMETHING LOCAL IS A STRONG ONE- FOR SO MANY OF US IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT. ENOUGH OR DO YOU ALSO FIND. YOU KNOW THE TOUR ARE A IS GOOD ENOUGH AND STRONG ENOUGH FOR COFFEE AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A QUALITY. OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA SAY YOU'RE YOURS IS THE FINEST COFFEE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S THE ONLY ONE BUT- YOU KNOW IT R. D. ARE YOU FINDING THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IT THAT IT'S GETTING ACCEPTED IN A WAY THAT THAT YOU AND HOPED IS INTRODUCING THIS NEW. CROP TO THE STATE THE DOES THAT HAVE BARRIERS- DITCHED HOW TO DESCRIBE WHAT THAT EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIKE. YEAH CALIFORNIA HAS GREATER WORK FOR COFFEE AND THE REASON IT'S NEVER BEEN GROWN HERE IS REALLY THE MARKET BECAUSE COFFEE HAS ALWAYS BEEN- THE BOTTOMLESS CUP. FREE REFILLS CETERA AND- OUR OUR LABOR LABOR COSTS AND WATER COSTS- JUST OUTWEIGH YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO DO THAT SO- BUT LUCKILY NOW THERE'S A pMORE ENTHUSIASM FOR COFFEE AS WELL AS LOCAL COFFEE AND LOCAL PRODUCE SO THEY THEY GO WELL TOGETHER. BECAUSE THE COFFEE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA STILL SO YOUNG THERE'S REALLY NOT ENOUGH OF IT YET TO FILL THE DEMAND WHICH MAKES THE COFFEE PRICES ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE RECOVERING LABOR AND WATER OF COURSE BUT WE'RE ALSO WE HAVE A VERY RARE PRODUCT AND SO IT'S VERY EXCITING RIGHT NOW AND I THINK THE GOAL. IS TO ENROLL MORE MORE FARMERS INTO THE COFFEE INDUSTRY- IS LOOKING AT IT LIKE WINE WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO HERE IN CALIFORNIA- THE MORE FARMS WE HAVE PRODUCING COFFEE EVENTUALLY THAT PRICE WILL COME DOWN IN MORE MARK- COFFEE SHOPS. AND CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY A CALIFORNIA GROWN COFFEE BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S STILL SO YOUNG AND IT'S SUCH A SPECIALTY CROP. THAT IT IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE COFFEE IT'S- BY IT'S FOR. THE SPECIALTY COFFEE CONNOISSEUR AT THIS POINT- BUT YES THE ENVIRONMENT CAN SUPPORT IT- CALIFORNIA'S LEADER IN AG ANYTHING WE GET OUR HANDS ON WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA DO WELL WITH IT. SO FAR COFFEES TASTED DELICIOUS. YEAH I WITH THAT I. WE WE'VE GOT. YES I REPRESENT MARIN WE'VE GOT EQUATOR- JOHN WEAVER THE FORMER MASTRO STIR OF PETEN THEY BOTH INTRODUCED ME INTO HOW TO TASTE COFFEE AND IT JUST KIND OF BLEW ME AWAY I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN PICK UP THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS IN COFFEE BEANS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO TRYING TO WORSE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS FOR THE OTHER PANELISTS IF THE TOURNAMENT. YEAH I THINK YOU ON SO FOR DOUG- YOU KNOW IN IN THE NORTH BAY WE WENT. IN ON WE BEING YOU KNOW THE OIL ALL OF OUR FARMERS IN IN DERRY MAN- AND DIRTY PEOPLE- TO SUSTAINABILITY. VERY EARLY HOW YOU TALK ABOUT BEING THE FIRST IN CINEMA FOR ORGANIC BUT A LOT OF US. A LOT OF. US IN THE NORTH BAY TO SWITCH OVER- PROBABLY PROCEEDING. AS YOU DID MUCH OF THE REST OF THE STATE AND EVEN THE NATION. WHAT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER. SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES THAT YOU'VE ENGAGED IN. YOU TALK A LITTLE ABOUT SCALE EVERYONE HAS CHALLENGES NO MATTER THE SCALE THAT YOU'RE AT- WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE EVEN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MAKE YOUR YOUR ENTRY POINT EASIER. BECAUSE OF SCALE OR EVEN REPEAT THE REGION THAT YOU COME FROM. I THINK YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST ONE IS PROBABLY WATER QUALITY YEAH- THAT IS PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST ONE. FROM THAT SCALE SIDE BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE STATE WATER QUALITY BOARD LOOKS AT. THE THEY SEE ALL THEIR USES THE SAME. CENTRAL VALLEY HAS OUR GROUNDWATER PROBLEMS YOU KNOW WORD NITRIC PROBLEMS. WE HAVE RUN OFF YOU KNOW INTO- OR WOULD POTENTIALLY RUN OFF INTO WATERSHEDS. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COST IT'S A PERK HOW. COST PER DAIRY. SO BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE NORTH BAY HAS DONE AS I STE AS I MENTIONED WE HAD THE ANIMAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE THROUGH SOME KIND OF FORM- STARTED IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES WHEN CALVIN PARCHMENT A FISHING GAME AT THAT TIME COULD NOT COME UP WITH THE MONEY TO DO THE TESTING WE IS THURMOND HIRED. THIRD PARTY- PAST UC EXTENSION AND- JERRY GUY PASS WESTERN UNITED FIELD REPRESENTATIVE THAT HAD. THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DAIRIES HAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAND BUT ALO WAS VERY REPUTABLE AND WE PAID HIM TO GO OUT AND DO THE SAMPLING RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THREE. THREE GUYS SAID THAT SAMPLE WE SAMPLED OVER SIXTY SITES BETWEEN SNOW MARIN COUNTY. IN THOSE SITES OR YOU KNOW THOSE REPORTS ARE TURNED INTO THE WATER BOARD BUT EVERY YEAR WERE FOUGHT BY ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS THAT THE DAIRIES ARE POLLUTING OR NOT DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB. AND I THINK THAT'S THE TOUGHEST THAT'S THE TOUGHEST ONE IS WHEN. WE'RE WORKING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO RUN THE FARM. IT REDUCES WILL YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE AND I SAID IT'S MANURE MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE ALL IT TAKES IS ONE LITTLE MISTAKE. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEBODY'S GOING BY THE ROAD THEY SAY APPROVED IN FRONT OF YOUR FARM AND THEY SEE YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA GET FINE- WE'VE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE THAT WAY AND I THINK MOST OF THE FORMS IN OUR AREA HAVE. I THINK MAYBE IT TOOK A LITTLE LONGER FOR THE LARGER DAIRIES IN CENTRAL VALLEY BUT THEY HAVE COME SO FAR AND WHAT YOU KNOW WITH THE HELP OF CARES. HELP WEST UNITED IN OUR OTHER- JERRY ORGANIZATIONS YOU KNOW WE HAVE MOVED. LEAPS AND BOUNDS AHEAD OF WHERE THE GEHRY ENTRY WAS YEARS AGO BUT- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT WHEN THOSE FEES COME FROM THE STATE I KNOW IT'S A PER CAL BUT STILL. IF YOU DO THE MATH ON. THREE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED CALS IT'S COSTING US MORE MONEY. THAN THE PER CALIFIA AT FIVE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND CALS. BECAUSE IT STARTS GETTING SO HIGH SO THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CAP IT HERE. BUT IT ACTUALLY COSTS THE SMALLER FARMER MORE MONEY FOR THEIR STATE WATER QUALITY FEE BECAUSE OF. IF YOU DO THE MATH. YEAH I'D IN. YEAH I. PRAISE THE RISK- IN INVENTOR TAKING THAT JASON HAD MADE AND DIVERSIFYING- HIS CROPS YOU TOOK RISKS. IN SOME OF THE- ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING THAT YOU'RE DOING. HOW DID YOU KIND OF FACTOR IN HOW MUCH RISK IS GOING TO BE AND HOW MUCH IS THIS FOR ME THAT TO BITE OFF- TO. YOU KNOW TAKE A CHANCE ON DOING THE RIGHT THING AND DOING WELL BY IT. I THINK THAT THE TOUGHEST ONE WAS PROBABLY THE NUTRIENT OFFSET PROJECT I DID WITH CITY SANTA ROSA- WE'VE WE'VE HAD A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE CITY WE'VE UTILIZED OUR WASTE WATER I KNEW. IF. YOU KNOW IF THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO- GET SOME OFFSET CREDITS THAT THERE THERE WAS NO WAY THEY COULD TAKE IT- EXPAND THE PLAN TO PUT THE MONEY BACK IN A PLAN TO MEET THOSE WATER QUALITY. REGULATIONS THAT WERE COMING DOWN ON HIM. SO THEN I POSSIBLY WOULDN'T HAVE YOUR GEISHA WATER. BUT AS SOON AS I LET. THE CONSULTANTS THAT WERE THERE AND THEY MADE THE PRESENTATION BEFORE THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD I GOT TWO PHONE CALLS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CAN GROUP SAYING WE'RE GOING TO SUE YOU COULD YOU JUST LET THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA SAY THAT YOU WERE. A POLLUTER MMHM. AND THANK GOODNESS FOR OUR REGIONAL BOARD- THEY STEPPED UP AND SAID NO. WE'RE NOT GONNA EVEN HERE THIS WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT ITS FIRST ONE EVER DONE THE UNITED STATES. SO YOU KNOW THOSE ARE KIND OF THE I HAVE. KIND OF STEPPED OUT ON SOME OF THESE THINGS BUT IT'S ALWAYS TO ME THERE THERE'S THAT BENEFIT I MEAN THAT. THAT BENEFIT WAS FOR THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA. PLUS IT WAS A MANAGEMENT BENEFIT. FOR MYSELF. IN AN AREA THAT I ALWAYS HAD TROUBLE MANAGING. SAME THING WITH THE STEP WITH THE OUR PROGRAM- YEAH IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE REDUCING ALL THE METRIC TONS OF CARGO OF YOU KNOW CO TWO AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT IT STILL IS GOING TO BENEFIT ME ON THE MANAGEMENT SIDE OF MY FARM. I THERE'S NO WAY MY PROJECTS SIX HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU KNOW IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO REALLY PAY IT BACK AND WHAT THE SAVINGS I'M GOING TO GET. FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT. BUT WE ALL DO RECOGNIZED AS YOU KNOW THE BENEFITS THAT WE'RE DOING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT YEAH. I JUST I'VE ALWAYS YOU KNOW THE PASSIONS THERE YEAH. THE PASSION TO KEEP THAT LAND WHEN I. YOU KNOW GO TO BED AND THINK ABOUT MY GRANDFATHER TELLING STORIES OF PAIN FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FOUR HUNDRED ACRES IN NINETEEN FIFTY. GOING TO BED TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HE WAS GOING TO MAKE THAT PAYMENT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN TO THIRD GENERATION. I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT GO AWAY YEAH. SO YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME. BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU YOU KNOW THAT YOU GET THE BENEFITS ALSO YEAH IT'S BRING INTO SHARING SOME OF THIS WAS DONE- BUT I DO WANT TO ECHO YOUR PRAISE THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER FOR. OUR OUR CD'S- WHICH WE'RE TRULY FORTUNATE TO HAVE IT AS WELL AS YOU SEE EXTENSION- I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND THEY BRING A LOT TO OUR COMMUNITY- SO FOR. FOR CHRISTINE. ECHOING A LITTLE BIT ALSO ON ON SENATE DOT HAD MENTIONED YOU'RE A SECOND GENERATION FARMER AND EVERY FARMERS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND IS DOING DOING THE BEST THAT THEY CAN- BUT SCIENCE IS TAKEN SUCH AMAZING LEAPS SINCE THE LAST GENERATION- I'D LOVE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF THE- JUST UNDERSTANDING FAMILY FARMING WHAT THE CONVERSATION IS LIKE BETWEEN YOU AND THE FIRST GENERATION AND HOW YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE OTHER GENERATION UNDERSTANDS WHERE SCIENCE IS GOING OR PRACTICES ARE GOING BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S FACT WHAT'S A CONVERSATION LIKE AS FAR AS LIKE WOW WE'RE DOING THIS NOW AND I YOU KNOW WHATEVER THOSE BENEFITS MIGHT BE. AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME THIS WILL BE THE LAST RESPONSE FOR THIS PAST. NO THAT'S OKAY. WELL MY DAD IS AN IMMIGRANT FROM SWITZERLAND. SO AND HE CAME OVER HERE AND STARTED FARMING IN THE SIXTIES. AND THEN GOT INTO COMMON FARMING WITH HIS BROTHER IN THE NIGHT EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND SO HE HAS SEEN A LOT OF CHANGE. I'M HE'S A YOU KNOW THE CONVERSATIONS WITH MY DAD. THEY'RE VERY OPEN HE IS ACTUALLY VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE ALL THE ADVANCES THAT WE HAVE MADE. EVEN SINCE HE'S RETIRED ALTHOUGH THEY NEVER REALLY RETIRE- YOU KNOW ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND- HE SOMEBODY STILL WITH THEIR THERE ARE RIGHT WITH US ALWAYS INCLUDING. ALMOST LIKE HISTORICAL INFORMATION LIKE WELL IT USED TO BE LIKE THIS BUT NOW YOU GUYS ARE DOING IT THIS WAY AND IT'S EVEN BETTER AND I CAN SEE WHY I MEAN HE DOES VERY THERE REALLY IS A BIG APPRECIATION FOR WHERE WE'RE GOING I MEAN IN THE FACT THAT WE'RE USING SO MUCH LESS WATER AND WE'RE USING SO MUCH LESS PESTICIDE. THEN ALTHOUGH BACK IN THE EARLY EARLY DAYS WHEN THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ANY OF THAT STUFF YOU KNOW HE RECALLS THAT AS WELL HE ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT SINCE THE WORLD HAS BECOME WE BECOME SO MUCH MORE GLOBAL THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE NOW COMING IN TO OUR AREA THAT WERE NEVER THERE WHEN HE WAS THERE. FOR EXAMPLE VARONE MY IN THE BEE POPULATION BECAUSE HE ALSO USED TO KEEP BEES YOU KNOW THAT'S N INVASIVE PETE- SPECIES NAVEL ORANGE WORM WHICH IS A HUGE PASS THAT WE DEAL WITH ALSO NON YOU KNOW INVASIVE SPECIES. SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE. AND IT'S ALWAYS HE'S- BEING FROM SWITZERLAND. AND IT'S SUCH A HOLE LIKE THEY DO EVERYTHING SO CLEAN- AND SO THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF AT YOU KNOW. AT THE TOP. OF HIS GOAL LAST. ANY I THINK HE'S PROUD THAT WE'RE GETTING THERE AGAIN LIKE WE'RE GOING BACK. FANTASTIC IT'S I REALLY WANT TO THANK OUR PANEL DOUG HI CHRISTINE- AND JASON FOR SUCH A- ROBUST- A DISCUSSION AND- THE CONVERSATION REALLY APPRECIATE YOU MAKING THE TIME FOR OUR HEARING TODAY SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS AND I'M SURE. YOU KNOW WE HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. IT'S A WIN WE WANT OUR FINAL PANEL FOR THIS HEARING- WHICH FEATURES TWO EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING- ONE AN ACADEMIC AND ONE A WELL KNOWN ADVOCATE A TO OFFER THEIR IDEAS AND PROPOSALS FOR HOW WE MIGHT BEST EXPANSES DATEABLE AND CLAIM AND CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE IN CALIFORNIA I'D LIKE TO FIRST WELCOME DR WILLIAM R. HORWATH. CHAIR AND PROFESSOR OF SOIL BIO GEO CHEMISTRY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF LAND AIR AND WATER RESOURCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. WHO WILL BE JOINING US REMOTELY HIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON CROP AND SOIL SCIENCE AND ECOSYSTEM AND LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY SO- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE WITH US DOCTOR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU. I HAVE SAY THAT LAST SESSION WAS FANTASTIC- BUT THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO- BE ABLE TO PRESENT MY RESEARCH I'M GOING TO SHARE THE SCREEN. ALL I CAN FIND IT- RIGHT HERE. WELL SEE THAT. YEAH OKAY. LET'S MAKE AN INTERPRETATION MONIQUE- CHANGE. YES S. GOOD FROM THERE PROFESSOR OKAY. GLASSMAKERS ARE AGAIN SORRY. IT'S NOT GOING TO GET IT BACK ALL RIGHT- THE GOAL IS TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO. BOTH MAINTAIN AND INCREASE THE CARBON CONTENT OF SOILS AS A VERY IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE IT IT. IT ADDRESSES MANY ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES AND IT ALSO. HELPS IN IN CROP PRODUCTIVITY- IN THAT IT MAINTAINS STABILITY AND PROVIDES. MORE EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES. THERE'S A BRIEF OUTLINE OF GOING ONLY GO BRIEFLY OVER SOME. OF THE WORKING LANDS INNOVATION CENTER I WAS ASKED JUST TO. MENTION IT- I'D LIKE TO GIVE THE CONCLUSIONS IN BY. AND WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY AND I'M GOING TO SAY THAT. THE ADOPTION MYRICK MICROIRRIGATION HAS DRAMATICALLY REDUCED NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. IN A REPORT THAT WE DID FOR CARB- I'M THE BIOPHYSICAL POTENTIAL TO REDUCE DOCTORS OXIDE WE DETERMINED OR OR FROM THE LITERATURE WE DETERMINED THAT. IF YOU KEEP IT IN FARMLAND BASICALLY. PRODUCES UP TO LESS THAN ARE SEVENTY TIMES LESS THAN ANY OTHER TYPE OF BLANK USE LIKE URBAN OR DEVELOPED. WELL WE HAVE SOME DECADE ALONG RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AT UC DAVIS TO ADDRESS THAT POTENTIAL TO SEQUESTER CARBON. WE LOOK MOSTLY AT COVER CROPS COMPOST IN THE WAR AND CROP ROTATIONS. ONE CARRY OUT A BOX QUESTION CARBON IS THAT YOU NEED TO ADD MORE NITROGEN. AND THAT I WANT TO HELP WITH THE POLICY SLIDE RULE. BALL SO THE WORKING LANDS INNOVATION CENTER WAS- THE PROJECT BEEN FUNDED BY THE STATE WELL IT'S LOOKING AT OTHER TYPES OF WAYS TO INCREASE ALL CARBON SEQUESTRATION PARTICULARLY CRUSHED. AND BAYRAKTAR ALSO LOOKING A COMPOST- COMPOST IS NOW. SIR WE HOPE TO DO THAT ARE DIVERT FOOD WASTE FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH COMPOSTING FACILITIES TO INCREASE BOTH THE AMOUNT AND QUALITY OF THE COMPOST. SOME PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM THE PROJECT SHOWS THAT THERE ARE INCREASED BICARBONATE LEVELS IN SOILS THAT HAVE BEEN THAT CRUSHED ROCK HAS BEEN APPLIED TO. WE'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE THAT RESEARCH IT TAKES YEARS THREE TO FIVE YEARS OR MORE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS ALL SIGNIFICANT. INCREASES OUR CARBON. SO JUST TO TAKE HOME THE POINT THESE PROJECTS WERE ALL DONE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHEN BE IMPLEMENTED SB THIRTY TWO- LOOKING AT WAYS TO REDUCE TAXES OXIDE EMISSIONS- FROM AGRICULTURE IT TURNS OUT THAT. IT'S ADOPTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES PARTICULARLY MICRO IRRIGATION SYSTEMS. HAVE RESULTED IN A DRAMATIC REDUCTION OF. NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS WHICH IN ITSELF REQUIREMENT FOR BETTER THEN- IT FROM A COUPLE OF CLIMATE WARMING POTENTIAL AND QUESTION FOR CARBON IT'S- BECAUSE IT CAN BE DONE EVERY YEAR HE COULD BE DEBT CONSISTENTLY. AND YASSER TO COURT- SO JUST HERE QUICKLY MOVES. IN MOST OF OUR STUDIES EXACTLY IN EVERY EXAMPLE EAT HEALTH WEALTH WELL IN GRAPES. ALMONDS AND WALNUTS IF YOU HAVE A MICROIRRIGATION SYSTEMS LIKE A SUBSURFACE DRIP SYSTEM THAT CAN BE SURPLUS. OUGHT IT GENERALLY PRODUCES LESS MATCHES OXIDE AND WHERE YOU CAN ADD KNOW THAT CHEAPER LIGHTER UNDER FLOOD IRRIGATION SYSTEM. SO WE ARE QUITE ENTHUSED ABOUT THIS AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SORT OF GET THIS OUT AND EVERY TIME I THINK IT'S COOL BUT NEVER SEEMS TO REALLY RESONATE AND I JUST WANNA MAKE IT RESONATE HERE. THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN LOOKING. FOR SO. EVERYONE KNOWS THE FORMER NUMBER OBJECTIVES IT. INQUIRES ABOUT QUITE SIX TONS OF CARBON THREE YEAR ALLEN AVERAGED ACROSS ALL GLOBAL LANDS OUR OUR GLOBAL AGRICULTURAL LAND. ATTENTIONAL FROM RESEARCH STUDIES SUGGEST AN AGRICULTURE CROPLAND IT'S ABOUT WHAT WHAT THE ONE POINT TWO COUNTS OF CARPER. TONS OF CARBON PER HECTARE PRETTY. GRAZING LANDS IN THE SAME ORDER OF MAGNITUDE- DISTURBS SOIL AS WELL WHAT I WOULD CALL OUT PEATLAND RESTORATION AND- DELTA WHICH HAS A MUCH HIGHER POTENTIAL I THINK MORE EFFORT SHOULD BE PUT INTO THE DELTA IN RECOVERING WELL SOILS AND MINIMIZING THE EFFECT OF LUCK INSTABILITY FOR EXAMPLE. AND THE WATER SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA PER SE. SO IN CALIFORNIA. I HAVE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL USING COVER CROPS COMPOSTED MANURE- AND CROP ROTATIONS. YOU GET ABOUT QUITE ONE TWO POINT THREE TONS OF CARBON ACTIVE. AND I'LL GO OVER THIS OUR STUDIES THAT WE'VE DERIVED FROM NATION FROM. THE STUDY HERE WAS STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND TWO WAS POLICY LIKE FARMING SYSTEM PROJECT IT LOOKED AT CONVENTIONAL FARMING. I FARMING THAT INCORPORATED WINTER COVER CROP AND ORGANIC FARMING ORGANIC FARMING IS WITH EIGHT COVER CROP AND MANURE ADDITION- SO YOU SEE THAT THE ORGANIC SYSTEM. IT'S ABOUT WHAT MAX OR WHAT WE CAN SEE OUT AS THESE STUDIES THIS IS POINT THREE TIMES PER HECTARE PER YEAR SO FOUR TO FIVE TIMES MAYBE IN TEN YEARS WHICH IS NOT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. IF YOU JUST DO A COVER CROP ALONG. GET ABOUT TWO POINT TWO TONNES PER HECTARE. IN OUR CENTURY EXPERIMENT AT RUSSELL RANCH ALL VERY SIMILAR EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. I'LL BE CONVENTIONAL IN THIS CASE AGAIN POPPING OUT WITH STANDARD TELL. STANGEL THE COVER CROP HERE WE HAVE LAST BUT IT WAS THE COVER CROP. IT HASN'T BEEN PLANET IS EVERY YEAR- THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE PROJECT EVERY OTHER YEAR. SO THAT'S THE ISSUE- WITH USING COVER CROPS IT HAS TO BE DONE EVERY YEAR TO GET THAT POTENTIAL ALL. AND IF YOU DO IT EVERY OTHER YEAR ARE VERY INCONSISTENTLY OR EVEN COMPOST ADDITIONS INCONSISTENTLY YEAH THAT. THE QUESTION DETENTION PRIEST. EITHER FOR ARMENIAN SIMILAR TO THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT POINT THREE. ANOTHER PROJECT W STARTED NINETEEN NINETY NINE AT THE UC WEST SIDE OUR RESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER IS WE LOOK AT THE FACT IT UNTIL. WE ARE INITIALLY VERY ENTHUSED ABOUT NO DEAL BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO BE SEQUESTERING CARBON. LIKE EACH WILL BALANCE BUT NOW AFTER TWENTY YEARS. YOU HAVE TO SORT OF TEMPER OUR ASSESSMENT. AND IT SHOWS THAT NO DEAL IS ESSENTIALLY MATCH. US THE QUESTION CARBON AT THE RATE WE THOUGHT. THAT MAKES KIND OF SENSE IN AN ARID DRY ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN- TURNS OUT THAT CHALLENGE- ACTUALLY DID BETTER THAN NO JAIL WITH NO COVER NOPE NOPE STANDARD DELAGE COVER CROP RESEARCH NOTE YELLOW COVER PROP YOU ACTUALLY LOST SOME CARBON INTELLECTUAL SYSTEM. SO MIXING THAT RESIDUE IN THE SOIL IS IMPORTANT TO GET IT TO THE MICROBIAL MOUTH TO CONVERT IT TO SOIL ORGANIC MATTER- THE STANDARD TILL COVER CROP I TURNED OUT TO. GET SIMILAR SEQUESTRATION RIGHTS DANDY ORGANIC SYSTEM. OVER TIME. ADAM I THINK HE'S RATES ARE ALSO PROMISED BY THE FACT THAT THE DE SOROS IN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAVE LOWER CARBON CONTENT AND THEY HAVE A GREATER POTENTIAL. TO SEQUESTER CARBON AT A FASTER RATE. AND SHE- ONE THING I HAVEN'T. RIVAS LINES WELL- YEAH IN THE ORGANIC SYSTEM IN THE RUSSELL RANCH RECENT DEEP CARBON. THAT AMOUNTS TO ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS THIS CARD- BUT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY YOUNGER OUR QUALIFICATION TICKETS AT THE EXPENSE WOULD BE. BUT WE SEE THAT IN STANDARD TELL IN IN IN THE- WEST SIDE- YOU'LL STATION. WHERE WE DO SEE DEEPER CARBON AS WELL SO IF YOU GO BLIND BEYOND THE STANDARD SOIL SAMPLING DEPTH WE MAY BE ABLE TO FIND THE BUSINESS CARD BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A HUGE EXPENSE FOR DOING THAT- IN A LOT OF VERY ABILITY SO IF. THERE IS A LOT OF PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH. ALL SO I'M GONNA. BUT ONE THAT WE GET SO SCIENTISTS TEND NOT ALWAYS KNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU SEQUESTER CARBON IN SOIL YOU HAVE TO SEQUESTER NITROGEN WITH IT. SO FOR EVERY EIGHT TO TEN. OR EXCUSE ME EIGHT TO TWELVE ATOMS OF CARBON YOU'LL NEED ONE ATOM OF NITROGEN. THAT'S WHAT THE CHEMISTRY OF SOLAR IF MATTER IS THAT'S THE STILL KIANA. SO THE QUESTION CARBON ALSO REQUIRE SEQUESTERING NITROGEN. AND IF WE DON'T SEQUESTER IF WE FOLLOW THE FOUR PER THOUSAND PROTOCOL OUR INITIATIVE I'LL WE WOULD NEED TO- TO SOMEHOW EITHER TO COVER CROPPING OR OR RECYCLING AND THAT WE BOTTOM NORMALLY WASTED HUNDRED EXTRA CARE GRANTS PER YEAR OR- AN AMOUNTS TO ABOUT FIFTY KILOGRAMS PER HECTARE OR PROXIMITY FIFTY POUNDS. PER ACRE PER YEAR YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WHEN WE% PUT THESE AMENDMENTS DOWN WE PUT A COVER CROP IN OR WE PUT COUPLES TELL ME THEY WERE DOWN WE OFTEN. OR WE HAVE TO BY STATE LAW ABOUT IT KNOWLEDGE WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE PLANT. AND THAT IS GOING TO BE USED AND NOT USED TO SEQUESTER CARBON SO THERE MAY HAVE TO BE ADDITIONAL. NITROGEN ADDED AND THAT'S NOT. AND IT'S A SCARY THING STAY. I BECAUSE WE TO HAVE- INCREASED ENERGY EFFICIENCY JUMPER OUR- RESOURCES AFTER WATER RESOURCE- DISPUTE WRAP UP- ONE THING I DID MENTION IS THAT ONCE CALIFORNIA. DEVELOP ALL THE WATER PROJECTS AND START YOUR GETTING PLANNED SO COVERED ACTUALLY INCREASED OVER TIME IN MANY PLACES PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BECAUSE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS WAS GREATER THAN THE NATIVE. ECOSYSTEMS SO IN SOME PLACES CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN INCREASING SOIL CARBON REGARDLESS OF THE INTENSIFICATION HAS OCCURRED IN- IN AGRICULTURE- CALIFORNIA. MY ADDITION HAS DRAMATICALLY MATCHES OXIDE EMISSIONS. NO TELL MAIN INCREASE TOTALS ALL CARBON. IN ALL CASES SOCOM'S RESTRICTION REQUIRES AN- WE SHOULD PRIOR TO RESOURCE PRIDE PRIORITIZE OUR SOILS- UP WHERE WE PUT OUR COMPOST IN THE NEW ONES AND I THINK AG LAND AT THE MOST AND AGAIN SHE BEGIN FARMLAND IS. ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO KEEP UP CLIMATE FRIENDLY ALL. TYPE OF SCENARIO. URBAN WITH ABLE. SO CAN WE DO IT I JUST KIND OF SHOW YOU WE CAN QUESTOR CARBON IN CALIFORNIA. BUT HAS AN ELEGANT PAPER BY AND ITS IN PROFESSOR OF SOIL SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. I SUBMITTED THIS AS FOR YOU TO- AS MATERIALS IT'S EASY IT'S EASY WORKING READING BUT IT'S VERY VERY. VERY ELEGANT. RESENTS THE PROBLEMS OF. THE QUEST FOR MARKET AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THE NATURALLY'S TECHNICIAN SIR. AB. MOST OF MY NAME A QUESTION A TON. THIS. EIGHTY THREE. WAY ABOVE THE MARK. SO THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE PUBLIC AND SOME AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE LARGEST TRADE COSTS. THANK COME ACROSS OR- DOING SO CURRENT REQUIRE ALL INCOME LABOR ALL HER PROPERTIES ACTUALLY IN SHORTS. I'M NOT ALWAYS SUITABLE RIGHT SEE AVAILABLE FOR EVERY APPLE. VERCELLI OF THE QUESTION IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. BOB THE LAST ASSISTANCE CHECK ASSISTANCE PARTICULARLY FROM USED COOPER EXTENSION AND THAT'S TRUST SERVICE TO YOU FARMERS AND GIVING IT THANK INFORMATION. AND TRYING TO HELP DO. YOU SEE NEXT HAS BEEN IN SOME SECURE EVER SINCE I CAME HERE IN NINETEEN SIX. AND COURSE THESE FARMERS ARE DURING. SO I WOULD THAT WE DO THE SAME AS WE GET WITH WATER. FILE AND- BIOPHYSICAL FACTORS WARMING WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AGAINST US IF WE GET SIGNIFICANT WARMING IN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL SLOW DOWN. SPEECH AND THAT AND JUST SO QUESTION CARBON MAY IMPACT FUTURE CROP GROWTH IS TOO MUCH CARBON COULD BE BACK TO WE NEED PROBABLY RESEARCH INTO THAT SO WE KNOW THAT INCREASING SOIL CARBON AT A REASONABLE RATE. INCREASES PROP CROP PRODUCTIVITY INSTABILITY BUT IF WE- FOUR SIX WE MAY HAVE OTHER ISSUES THEN WE SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN FOR SYSTEMS THAT WERE RELEASED LAST BEHIND ENEMY GETS SLOWER GROWTH OF THE- NEXT FORCED. OKAY KEEPING AG LAND WILL BE SEVENTY BY UP 270% TIMES LESS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAN OTHER TYPES OF LAND USE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE HERE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT SO CARBON IMPROVE SO MANY THINGS WATER RETENTION WATER INFILTRATION YIELD STABILITY IN CROPS FOOD SECURITY ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SO ANY AMOUNT LOOKS THE CARBON CAN BE SEQUESTERED WE'LL ALL BE OUT AHEAD OF THE GAME AND IN DEEP WATERS. THANK YOU. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION IT'S- YESTERDAY THE INFORMATION I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- AT THE END OF THE PANEL- AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT'S MY PLEASURE TO. WELCOME CAT TAYLOR WHO'S ALSO JOINING US REMOTELY- MISS TAYLOR ADVOCATES PASSIONATELY. AND EFFECTIVELY FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SMART POLICIES ALONG WITH HER HUSBAND TOM STIERS. SHE FOUNDED THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED ACRES TOM CAT RANCH IN THE BAY AREA. AN OPERATION EXPLORES AND PROMOTES REGENERATIVE AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. WELCOME IS TAYLOR IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN- WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU ROUND OUT THIS PANEL AND HEARING THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS AND THE COMMITTEE- THANK YOU FOR FASTER FOR YOUR LAST POINT ESPECIALLY. THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING SO- I'M- MY NAME'S CAT TAYLOR AND I'M GONNA EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY WE ARE INVOLVED IN THE HEARING TODAY- TOMCAT RANCH IS A LEARNING LABORATORY ANALYZING DE RISKING AND BROADCASTING REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS- I THINK MY COLLEAGUES GOING TO SHARE. A SCREEN TO PRESENT A DECK OR MAYBE THE- MANY S. JUST JUST ONE MOMENT I A- THERE IS A TECHNICAL ISSUE WHERE I HAVE TO RESTART IT AND GIVE IT THAT PERMISSION I APOLOGIZE IT SHOULD BE ONE MINUTE. NO WORRIES I'LL KEEP GOING- WE'LL BE FINE. SO FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS WE HAVE BEEN COALESCING WITH HUNDREDS OF BRANCHES IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES COVERING SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES IN MONITORING FOR THE PROMISE OF REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE AND RANCHING. WE HAVE ONSITE SCIENCE PARTNERS IN POINT BLUE CONSERVATION SCIENCE OF WILL BE IN ON PROPERTY SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX AND THEY A AND WE HAVE DATA TO BACK UP ALL THE ASSERTIONS THAT WE WILL MAKE TODAY. IN COLLABORATION WITH WHITE BLUE WE HAVE HELPED INSPIRE OVER TWO MILLION ACRES OF RANGELAND IN CALIFORNIA TO SHIP TO REGENERATIVE PRACTICE WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO LANDRY MATURATION OF RETURNING LAD TO INDIGENOUS AND BLACK FOOD WAYS. AND PEOPLE WE ARE EXPLORING COOPERATIVE OWNERSHIP MODELS OF FARMWORKERS FARMER PLANS- AND LAND TRUSTS AND WE BELIEVE THAT REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE GIVES US SIX FIVE FOLD OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS ALONG THE LINES SUGGESTED BY THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THIRTY BY THIRTY. AND CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE COMMITMENTS AS WELL AS OUR COMMITMENT TO RACIAL EQUITY GENDER EQUITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- BEES- PROMISES AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE REFLECTED IN THE CALIFORNIA AGENCIES ADVISORIES OF NATURAL RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION INCLUDING AGRICULTURE AS WELL AS THE BUYING CLIMATE PLAN. AND WE STAND READY TO HELP CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR YOUR SUCCESS TWO. OF YOU WILL HAVE BEEN PROVIDED A PAMPHLET THAT IS THE PRESENTATION IN MUCH GREATER DETAIL AND THAT WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO SHARE WITH STAFF AND USE AS A REFERENCE. A NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THIS IS THE CHECKLIST OF THE DEMANDS OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO RETURN 30% OF CALIFORNIA'S LANDS IN RANIERI'S TO CONSERVATION INCLUDING WORKING LANDS WE HAVE HAD TAKEN MANY INSIGHTS IN OUR WORK OVER THE YEARS AND- ESPECIALLY MOST RECENTLY AND GROWING THE TABLE. A PROGRAM IN COLLABORATION WITH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS TO AVOID FOOD WASTE AND FEED HUNGRY CALIFORNIANS IN OUR TIME. AND WE WOULD ASSERT THAT ARE- CURRENT INDUSTRIAL CONCENTRATED VERTICALLY INTEGRATED ACTS SYSTEM IS SUFFERING. FROM BRITTLENESS SOME INJUSTICE IN ON SUSTAINABILITY IN WAYS THAT WE CAN REDUCE ADDRESSED THROUGH REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE- END. JUST TO NOTE FARMS FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE THE HEROES OF THIS STORY- OUR ESTEEMED SCIENTISTS HAVE PREDICTED THAT WE HAVE NONE THE LESS ONLY SIXTY MORE HARDEST LEFT UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM. SO WE DO NEED A NEW PARADIGM WHERE AND TO US IT IS REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE- ED REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE IN MANY WAYS IS A RETURN TO LONG STANDING TRADITIONS OF FOOD AND FARMING. AND IT DOES- UGH PROVIDE FOR US MANY OF THE QUALITIES THAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER MANDATES LIKE RACIAL EQUITY ECOLOGICAL REPAIR AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY. AND WE HAVE READY TO IMPLEMENT SOLUTIONS WITHIN REGENERATIVE REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE FOR THE AGENCIES THE LEGISLATURE AND THIS COMMITTEE. OF 30% OF OUR LANDS ARE ALREADY POISED FOR A VOLUNTARY NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION SERVICE CLIMATE BENEFICIAL PRACTICES THAT'LL ENSURE BIODIVERSITY FOOD SECURITY AND ECONOMIC RESILIENCY- AND THE WATER BENEFITS THAT COME ARE A TENDON- IN PRE SEEDS SOIL AND CARBON CO BENEFITS. HAD THEIR OWN VALUE FOR CALIFORNIA AS WELL NOT TO MENTION THIS WILL BE A GIANT JOBS PROGRAM. UP FOR UPGRADED WE'RE IN THE ACCESS IT WILL US THIS TO PRISON. THAT IS DEVASTATING THE CENTRAL VALLEY- ESSENTIALLY THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS IT TEED UP BASEBALL FOR REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE HIT A HOME RUN. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WHAT IS REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE WE HAVE TO FIND IT WITH POINT BLUES SCIENCE AS THE SCIENCE ART OR OCCUPATION THAT PROVIDES AMPLE NUTRITIOUS FOOD IMPROVE LOCAL ECONOMIES SUPPORTS RACIAL AND GENDER EQUITY BILLS SOIL FERTILITY RESTORES BIODIVERSITY ABOVE AND BELOW THE GROUND. OPTIMIZES WATER CYCLING AND QUALITY AND ALL BY USING NATURAL PROCESS SEES WITH MINIMAL OFF FARM INPUTS THAT SHE CLIMATE STABILITY BY RESEARCH BY SPRINT CARBON ANOTHER ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS TO THE SOIL WHERE CARBON CAN DO NO HARM- NOTE THAT I NEED TO TALK TO PROFESSOR I HOPE YOU CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT. OF THE SIX CORE PRINCIPLES OF REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE ARE TO CONSIDER THE CONTEXT BECAUSE WE HAVE GREAT DIVERSITY IS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MINIMIZE SOIL DISTURBANCE MAXIMIZE DIVERSITY IN THE CROP SOIL AND ECOSYSTEMS. KEEP THE SOIL COVRED WITH COVER CROPS MAINTAIN YEAR ROUND LONG ROOTED PLANTS AND REAR INTEGRATE LIVESTOCK WE SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE THE ATTENDANT OF REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE IS TO MINIMIZE OR AVOID OFF FARM INPUTS ESPECIALLY EXPENSIVE CHEMICALS. THIS DEFINITION OF REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY LARGE CONSUMER PRODUCT COMPANIES LIKE GENERAL MILLS NESTLE AS WELL AS MY MISSION DRIVEN SOCIAL ENTERPRISE PRICES LIKE PATAGONIA AND ANNIE'S ORGANICS- IT SHOULD WE SHOULD NOTE THAT THESE PRINCIPLES COMPOUND WHEN APPLIED TOGETHER FOR MAXIMO THE SECT AND MULTIPLE CO BENEFITS- AS WELL AS- HELP OF. WAS MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND COMBAT SHOCKS LIKE FLOOD DROUGHT. AND PESTILENCE NEXT SLIDE. SO THE IS A DAY OF HOUSE RESTRUCTURING XIN OF CARBON WORKS IN WHAT LATE TERMS AND THAT'S WHAT I AM A LAYPERSON ESSENTIALLY THE PROCESS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS THE PLAN. IS YOU'RE CONVERTING SOLAR ENERGY- TO CARBOHYDRATES AND SUGARS WHICH IT EXPECTS CHANGES WITH THE RICH MICROBIAL COMMUNITY BELOW GROUND FOUR OF FIVE ORGANISMS IN THE WORLD LIVE IN OUR SOIS. AND THEY RUN ALONG ARE MYCORRHIZAL HIGHWAYS MINING AND ESSENTIAL MINERALS AND NUTRIENTS WHICH THE- MICROSOMAL COMMUNITY THEN EXCHANGES WITH THAT PLANT IN- FOR THOSE CARBOHYDRATES AND SUGAR WHICH CONSTITUTES SOIL. SOIL CARBON IN THE GROUND- THERE IS- ADDED BENEFIT TO DEEP SOIL CARBON IN THE SENSE THAT IT REMAINS MORE DURABLY AND IS NOT RESPONDING OR TO PHOTOSYNTHESIS- PROCESS SEES AFTER THE FACT- THE INTEGRATION OF LIVESTOCK IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THOSE ANIMALS ARE QUICKLY- CLIPPING OFF JUST THE A SHORT BIT OF THE PLANT WHICH INSPIRES A PLANT TO GROW AGAIN BECAUSE A PLAN IS ALWAYS SEEKING TO BALANCE ITS BIOMASS ABOVE THE GROUND WITH THIS BIOMASS BELOW THE GROUND. THE END WE DO BELIEVE THERE IS SIMPLE SOIL TESTING COMING THAT WILL HELP US BENCHMARK SOIL CARBON IN A WAY THAT WILL OPEN UP THE SOIL CARBON MARKETS WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT. LATER NEXT SITE. THE DIFFERENCE IS CLEAR TO THE HI AND I KNOW WE DO NEED TO MEASURE SCIENTIFICALLY BUT YOU CAN SEE IN THIS PICTURE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEPLETED SOIL AND A HEALTHY SOIL EXIDE. SO A REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE PROVIDES PLENTIFUL AND VERIFIABLE CO BENEFITS IT'S A PERFECTLY SYNCHRONIZED TOOL TO GARNER ROBUST WORLD ECONOMIES BIODIVERSITY OF ABOVE AND BELOW THE GROUND AND IN THE FARMHOUSE. HI WATER QUALITY IN QUANTITY FOOD SYSTEM RESILIENCY RACIAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE SO HEALTH AND FERTILITY CLIMATE WE SAMPLE AS ASIAN HUMAN OUT WELLNESS INCLUDING FOR FARMWORKERS AND ANIMAL WELFARE LET'S GO THROUGH ONE BY ONE. SO ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF RATE REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IS INCREASED WATER INFILTRATION TO PROVIDE WILL HAVE A HIGHER QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF WATER IN OUR SOILS THE GROUND COVERED BY HEALTHY PLANTS INFILTRATES WATER AND RE HYDRATES SOILS. BARE GROUND BY CONTRAST CAUSES RUNOFF EROSION AND FLOODING REHYDRATED SOILS AREN'T EXCELLENT WAY TO COMBAT FIRES FLOODS AND DROUGHT WHICH ARE CHRONIC CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WATER INFILTRATION TRACKS CARBON THE SEQUESTRATION IN A READILY VERIFIED WEIGHT ALREADY AMPLE WATER AND THE RESULT IN HIGHER YIELDS ALLOWS FARMERS TO RESIST DEVELOPMENT THAT VERY EXPENSIVE CONVERSION THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT. AND WATER IS A HUGE ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SLIDE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WE ALSO CAN MAKE THE BUSINESS CASE FOR REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE AS IT GENERATES GREATER AND MORE RELIABLE PROFITS FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS HERE'S WHERE THAT HAPPENS ALL THESE ARE ALL THE INCREASE SOURCES OF REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE AND THE RESULTING DECREASED COSTS A FAMOUS EXAMPLE IS GAY BROWN WHO'S BEEN FARMING AN IDENTICAL FIVE THOUSAND ACRES IN NORTH DAKOTA DO YOU HIS COMMODITY GROWING NEIGHBORS AND WHERE HE IS ACHIEVING TWELVE TIMES OR REVENUE THAT HIS NEIGHBORS KO. BUT PLEASE ALSO SEE IN THE MORE DETAIL PAMPHLET OUR BUSINESS PROFILES VERY HIGHLY EVIDENCED WITH REAL GROWERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. NEXT SLIDE. REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURAL ALSO RESTORES AND PROTECTS BIODIVERSITY ON WORKING LANDS WHICH IS A HALLMARK OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. A TOMCAT RICH ALONE HOST OVER A HUNDRED MIGRATORY BIRDS WHO ARE LEADING INDICATORS OF ECOLOGICAL HEALTH ARE PLANNED GRAZING BOTH PROTECTS AND RESTRICTS THE PRESENCE OF CATTLE SO THAT ABUNDANT LARGE FAUNA HAVE PLENTY OF PREY. TO HUNT AWAY FROM THE- CATTLE HERD- I'M RESTORING IN OUR CASE KEYSTONE ANIMALS LIKE MOUNTAIN LIOS BADGER FOX DEER AND COYOTES ALL OF WHICH SUGGEST A VERY HEALTHY HEALTHY ECOSYSTEM BELOW THEM. NEXT SLIDE- WORKING LANDS ARE A KEY CLIMATE SOLUTION AT SCALE- THIS IS A CHART SHOWING THAT IF NATIONALLY ALL THE CRAP WENT ALL AGRICULTURAL LANDS ADOPTED JUST FOUR OF THE TWENTY NINE ENTERS YES PRACTICES THAT WOULD BE- IS THAT. EASIER ONES TO ADMINISTER- WE WOULD REACH ZERO EMISSIONS IN AGRICULTURE BY TWENTY FORTY- NEXT SLIDE. AND REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE CREATES- THESE VICTORIES AT SCALE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL A HUNDRED MILLION ACRES IN CALIFORNIA JUST A 1% INCREASE IN THE SOIL ORGANIC MATTER ON THE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION OF THEM DECADES CROPLANDS WINS WHAT WOULD SEQUESTER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION MEGATONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE. WHICH IS NEARLY TWELVE TIMES THE CURRENT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION SHORTFALL THAT WE'RE FACING IT'S EQUIVALENT TO AVOIDING EMISSIONS FROM SEVENTY TWO MILLION VEHICLE MILES EACH YEAR AND INCREASES OUR ANNUAL WATER BY ONE AND A HALF MILLION ACRE FEET OR FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT TRILLION GALLONS EACH YEAR. AT JUST A SIDE NOTE OF BECAUSE I LOVE THE PRESENTATION FROM THE ABOUT ALMONDS COVER CROPPING A LOAN ON THE ONE POINT THREE MILLION ACRES OF ALMONDS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD SEQUESTER TWO MILLION MEGATONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EACH YEAR. NEXT SLIDE. AND THERE'S A COMPOUNDING EFFECT- TO REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE THAT WILL HELP US REACH A NEW EQUILIBRIUM THIS SYMBIOTIC CONNECTION BETWEEN WATER CARBON IN PLANTS BENEFITS US ALL. WATER AGAIN IS A PROXY FOR CARBON WHEN WE GET WATER RIGHT USUALLY GET SOIL AND CARBON RIGHT AS WELL. THE INCREASE PHOTOSYNTHESIS CREATES MORE SOIL ORGANIC MATTER THAT ALLOWS MORE WATER HOLDING CAPACITY AND IN TURN INCREASES PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN THE PROCESS THIS CONTINUOUS CYCLE INCREASES BIODIVERSITY SAFEGUARDS ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY AND FOOD SECURITY. AND WILL HELP US MEET OUR TWENTY FORTY FIVE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL NEXT SLIDE. IN SHORT REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE IS A FIVE FOLD OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT WILL REDUCE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE THAT ARE ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN TWENTY TWO AND GASES. IT WILL RECENT WESTER CARBON KIT BECAUSE WE WON'T GET TO OUR CLIMATE GOALS BY EMISSION REDUCTION ALONE. IT PROVIDES REAL TOOLS TO MITIGATE WILDFIRE FLOOD DROUGHT AND PESTILENCE THEY'RE HERE TO STAY- IT EMPOWERS FOR A RACIAL AND GENDER EQUITY AND I'D WITH MORE DEMAND FOR A BLACK INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF COLOR GROWERS. AND IT CAN GALVANIZE ABROAD A STAKEHOLDER GROUP TO DELIVER A STRONG POLITICAL BASE FOR CHANGE. ALL WEBER SPROUT ALL WHILE RESTORING OUR DEPLETED SOILS. NEXT. FIVE AND WE ARE READY TO PROPOSE TO YOU READY TO IMPLEMENT BIG IDEAS- TO ACHIEVE THE WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN FOR CALIFORNIA GROWERS. THE BIG IDEA NUMBER ONE IS TO CREATE A STATEWIDE MONITORING EFFORT- THAT IS ALREADY UNDER WAY BE THAT THROUGH POINT LOSE RANGE THAT MONITORING NETWORK OR THE TOTAL AG MONITORING OF IS RE AND THE JET PROPULSION LAB COAT- COLLABORATION CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY LEADING THE WAY BUT THERE ARE ALSO EFFORTS TO CREATE A NATIONAL SOIL CARBON REGISTRY THAT WOULD ENABLE SOIL CARBON MARKET. AND ECHOES OF THE SAME IN THE BUYING CLIMATE PLAN. THE BIG GUY NUMBER TWO IS TO SCALE RECOGNIZED USDA NRCS PRACTICES WITH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INCENTIVES EXISTING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INCENTIVES ALREADY INCLUDE THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM DISCUSSING DAY. ZERO CALIFORNIA FOOD FOR CALIFORNIA KIDS GUIDING SCHOOL DISTRICT PURCHASING. GROWING THE TABLE AVOIDING FOOD WASTE AND FEEDING THE HUNGRY NEW CROP INSURANCE PRODUCTS. PRODUCTS THAT GUARANTEE EXPECTED YIELDS WHEN CARBON FARMING PRACTICES ARE APPLIED- AND SOIL IN CARBON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES MARKETS. THE GUY NUMBER IDEA NUMBER THREE WHICH HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BY OTHERS TO DATE TO PROVIDE ENHANCED AND CONSISTENT ACCESS TO PROFESSIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. NRCS RCD EXTENSION AND SHE GOES STATE'S REGENERATIVE INSTITUTE ARE ALREADY PROVIDING INFIELD CONSULTING- AND CARBON FARM PLANNING SERVICES AND COULD BE FUNDED TO GREATER EFFECT. THIS WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN SOLUTION CENTER REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE CAN GALVANIZE A BROAD AND DIVERSE COALITION OF STAKEHOLDERS FROM CLIMATE TO CONSERVATION FROM FOOD TO HEALTHCARE FROM LABOR TO AG FROM EDUCATION TO RACIAL AND GENDER EQUITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE TIME TODAY AND PLEASE DO YOU DISTRIBUTE THE PAMPHLETS TO YOUR STAFF AND OTHER CONCERNED STAKEHOLDERS. MISS TAYLOR VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION ON GREAT INFORMATION- WE HAVE ANY. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIVING. YEAH HE'S REALLY QUICKLY FOR US TAYLOR ONE EXPRESSING GRATITUDE FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BOUNTY BOX PROGRAM AT THE AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE OF MARIN IT WAS AN INGENIOUS WAYS FOR THAT SMALL LOCAL FARMERS FROM ACROSS THE BAY AREA SOUTH BAY ALL OVER- GOT THEIR CROPS HEALTHY FOOD UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAKING THAT. POSSIBLE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF ISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY QUESTION KIDS AND FUELING IT'S MORE FOR THE PROFESSOR IN REGARDS TO THE MICRO CLIMATES YOU SHOWED A LOT OF GREAT DATA WITH THE YOUR CARBON SEQUESTRATION BUT I KNOW WITH OUR CLIMATE CHANGE- ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING UNIT I KNOW A LOT OF TIMES IT DOESN'T GET MENTIONED ENOUGH AND I KNOW WE'VE- GOT ADDRESS. SLIGHTLY ON THE LAST PANEL BY JASON BRIDGES THE REDUCTION IN TEMPERATURES IN YOUR GATED LANDS WHERE WE ARE SEQUESTERING CARBON- IF THE PROFESSOR RUN ACROSS ANY DATA ALONG THOSE LINES I KNOW IT'S SAID THAT IT'S ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN DEGREES COOLER WITHIN YOUR GATED LANCE VERSES IN URBAN AREAS BUT ACTUALLY HAVING THE DATA TO BACK IT UP IS ALWAYS A LOT NICER. YEAH THAT'S A BIT OF A CHALLENGING QUESTION BECAUSE THAT A LOT OF THAT DATA WAS DEVELOPED UNDER FLOOD IRRIGATION TECHNIQUES. AND THERE IS SORT OF A LOT OF APPLE TRANSPIRATION THAT LED TO THAT COOLING- BOTH FROM THE PLANT AND SOIL- NOW WITH THE MICRO IRRIGATION TECHNIQUES- WATER USE EFFICIENCIES GIRLY HIGHER YOU HAVE LESS SORELY REPARATION YOU STILL HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF PLANT RESPIRATION AND MAYBE EVEN MORE BECAUSE PRODUCTIVITY IS OFTEN INCREASED UNDER THESE MICRO IRRIGATION SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE INTIMATE DOES JUST CONVERTING TO MY CAREER- SUBSURFACE DRIP SYSTEMS GETS ON AVERAGE A THIRTY PERCENT. INCREASE SO YOU WOULD EXPECT PERJURERS O THE SURFACE AREA AND- ANY OPERATION FROM THAT EXAMPLE TRACK- TRANSPIRATION FROM THAT. AND SO. YES IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT YOU'RE GETTING ARE CAN COOL- I THINK THAT ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES THOUGH IS THAT AS CLIMATE WARMS AND- I MIGHT BE STEPPING OUT OF BOUNDS HERE- IT'S THE NIGHTTIME TEMPERATURES THAT REMAIN A LITTLE HIGHER- VERSES THE DAYTIME TEMPERATURES. WHICH ARE A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC. BUT THAT MAY BE OKAY BECAUSE IF THERE'S LESS SOIL EVAPORATION AT NIGHT- THERE'S. OR OR A BILL WELL ANYWAY I WAS GOING TO GOING TO SAY THAT IT YEAH YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT IN ASSUMING THAT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF ABERRATION BUT STILL TEMPERATURES ARE WARMING. SO WHAT IS THE BASE LONG BECAUSE WE SEE FOR EXAMPLE IN TREE CROPS THERE ARE THEY ARE BEING- AFFECTED- FURTHER BERLE'S ATION PERIOD FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE TEMPERATURES ARE RISING. OKAY I THINK I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT SAID THAT THE SO I WANTED TO ASK THAT- TO YOU SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I KNOW. AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND WE TALK ABOUT OTHER ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA SUCH AS HOUSING- IN IN THE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING UNITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THEN WE GET INTO THINGS LIKE URBAN SPRAWL- THERE. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US REMEMBER- WE DON'T NEED TO SPRAWL OUT INTO AGRICULTURAL AREAS- IN LOSE THESE AREAS THAT ARE ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THE IMPORTANCE THAT IT IS TO KEEP THOSE- AND KEPT THAT IN MIND BECAUSE WE'RE- WE'RE SEEING TOO OFTEN- AT GLANCE WILL GET SOLD OFTEN TURN INTO HOUSING UNITS. AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY HELPING THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE. HELPED KEEP IT. OKAY SO I THINK WITH THAT I KNOW WE ARE OVERTIME BUT REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE TIME FOR A FOR HEARING- REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE INFORMATION ALL OF OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE RECEIVED IT- AND YOU KNOW WITH THAT LOOK FORWARD TO A FUTURE ENGAGEMENT WITH YOU BOTH AND- EXCITED TO WORK WITH YOU. THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. OKAY SO WITH THAT I JUST LEARNED OF IT OVERSIGHT- AS IT RELATES TO HAVING AN OPEN TELEPHONE LINE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT FOR INFORMATIONAL HEARING- AND SO UNFORTUNATELY WE FOUND OUT OF THIS OVERSIGHT IS TOO LATE TO ADD A PHONE LINE AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY COVERT NINETEEN HAS MADE IT VERY CHALLENGING FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO JOIN IN PERSON HERE- CERTAINLY- YOU'RE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYONE PRESENT TO OFFER PUBLIC COMMENT- AND YOU KNOW SOME THE WALKING ALL THE FEEDBACK VIA EMAIL TO OUR COMMITTEE ARE- HI COMMITTEE EMAIL IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE- YOU CAN SEND US- SOME CORRESPONDENCE BY A LETTER THROUGH THE MAIL. I'D BE HAPPY TO- THE YOU KNOW WORK WITH MY STAFF SHOULD SOMEONE WANT TO SCHEDULE A VIRTUAL MEETING I'D BE HAPPY TO- SET THAT UP- TO ENTERTAIN ANY COMMENTS- AND OBVIOUSLY ALL THE CORRESPONDENCE THAT WE RECEIVE IN OUR OFFICE A DRUG COMMITTEE WE WILL SHARE THAT WITH ALL MEMBERS OF- OUR COMMITTEE SO YOU KNOW WITH THAT REALLY WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS WHO PARTICIPATED ARE HEARING I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS. WHO WERE HERE AND ASK GREAT QUESTIONS- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THIS IS A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- YOU KNOW AS A AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE CERTAINLY NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT OUR AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY ANYWAY THAT WE CAN UTILIZE AGRICULTURE TO MEET CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS AND CREATE THESE PATHWAYS TO INCENTIVIZE A LOT OF THESE PRACTICES I THINK WHAT WE HEARD TODAY OBVIOUSLY FINDING FINDING FINDING. IS VERY CRITICAL- OFFERING THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO- ARE- YOU KNOW THAT THOSE THAT WORK IN AGRICULTURE IS GONNA BE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS AND VIABILITY OF IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT INDUSTRY- ONE THAT FEEDS NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT YOU KNOW OUR COUNTRY IN THE WE'RE- SO BUT- WITH THAT. I REALLY. STAFF AND- APPRECIATE THE SERGEANTS WHO- HAVE BEEN HERE. AND- WE STAND ADJOURNED THANK YOU.
