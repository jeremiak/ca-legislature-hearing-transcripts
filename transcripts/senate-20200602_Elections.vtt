FACT INTRODUCED THIS VERY BILL

01:29:27.829 --> 01:29:29.764
THAT YOU HAVE HERE TODAY. SIX

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:31.499
YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST CAME

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:33.468
BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. IN FOR

01:29:33.534 --> 01:29:36.003
A SERIES OF REASONS WE CHOSE IN

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:37.872
THE SENATE TO MOVE. SENATOR

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:40.408
ALLEN AND I WAS THEN CHAIR OF

EXTENDED TIME FOR TEN DAYS TO

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:48.382
GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES THAT

01:29:48.449 --> 01:29:50.585
THAT WOULD WORK. SO WHY I

01:29:50.651 --> 01:29:51.753
STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS I WOULD

01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:53.454
MOVE THE BILL AND ASKED IF I

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:54.689

DO THINK THE CHALLENGING AND

01:30:05.266 --> 01:30:06.968
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS

01:30:07.034 --> 01:30:08.703
THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.838
WE CAN DO. YOU KNOW WHAT OUR

01:30:10.905 --> 01:30:12.073

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:18.279
MOVIE STAR. WE'RE NOT MOVIE

01:30:18.346 --> 01:30:20.481
STAR EPISODE. BUT I JUST THINK

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:21.449
THAT A- WOULD TRYING CONTINUE

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:23.251
FIX TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE

REGISTRAR'S IN CERTAIN COUNTIES

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:34.095
DID WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:34.796

01:35:34.795 --> 01:35:36.030
BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:37.565
ACTUALLY FLATTEN THE CURB BUT

01:35:37.631 --> 01:35:38.899

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:18.873
HAVE TO STAND NEAR EACH OTHER

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:19.473
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO RISK THEIR

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:20.774
