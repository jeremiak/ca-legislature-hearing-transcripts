HOW TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:40.426

THAT ROLLS IT OUT. IN PHASES

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:03.348
THAT WE BUILD OFF OF THE PHASES

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:57.155
INITIALLY PLANNED TO DEVELOP A

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:59.658
SYSTEM THAT DID NOT. CAPTURED

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:01.627
ELECTRONICALLY THE LOCATION.

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:03.629
I'M NEVER THE LESS- AND

00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:05.364
RECEIVED- WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.765
APPROVAL FROM THE CENTERS FOR

SO THE REASON I'M RAISING THIS

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.390

I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:40.998
QUESTION. THERE'S TWO RESPONSES

00:41:41.065 --> 00:41:42.233
TO THAT QUESTION THE FIRST

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:44.201
RESPONSE REALLY IS AROUND

00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:46.270
CHANGING SYSTEMS AT THE POLICY

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:49.373
LEVEL. OUT WE CAN DO A LOT BACK

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.875
TO DISRUPT INEQUITIES AT THE

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:52.643
LOCAL LEVEL WITHIN PROGRAMS AND

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:54.311
SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED.

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:55.579
BUT THE PREMISE BEHIND THIS

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:56.814
PROPOSAL REALLY IS LOOKING AT

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:58.549
THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE ACROSS

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:01.352
THE AGENCY FIVE AND A TWELVE

00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:02.753
DEPARTMENTS AND FIVE OFFICES.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.655
AWAITING THE DATA AND

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:06.557
DEVELOPING POLICIES IN ORDER

INEQUITIES AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.930
I. THINK THAT ONCE WE BEGIN TO

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:16.567
pCOMPONENTS. ALTERNATELY HAS

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:18.269
PROFOUND IMPACTS AT THE LOCAL

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:20.237
LEVEL BECAUSE IF WE CAN CHANGE

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:22.640
THE SYSTEM. I ANY AND WHAT IN

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:23.908
WAYS IN WHICH WE ADMINISTER

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:25.476
PROGRAMS THE RULES AND

00:42:25.542 --> 00:42:26.577
REGULATIONS THAT WE PUT

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:28.946
FORWARD. THOSE ALL WILL HAVE A

00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:30.915
DIRECT IMPACT ON EITHER THE

00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:33.384
CONSUMER. WHO HE OR SHE MIGHT

THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING

00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:38.555
DELIVERED WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITY

00:42:38.622 --> 00:42:39.857
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

00:42:39.924 --> 00:42:41.058
THINK ABOUT IT TOO FULL IT'S

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:42.493
ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:43.894
INEQUITIES IN WHAT WE CAN DO AT

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:45.296
THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT IT'S

00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:46.363
EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.165
LOOK AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL AND

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:53.671

REGARDS TO ACTIONS THAT COULD

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:12.923
BE TAKEN I THINK OUR INTENTION

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.658
HERE REALLY IS TO WORK FIRST

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:16.193

WOULD BE DOING THE LICENSE

00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:38.315
WOULD NOT BE MAKING THAT

00:43:38.382 --> 00:43:40.384
RECOMMENDATION. THE INTENT IS

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:41.986

WITH A BROADER STAKEHOLDER

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.723

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:07.011
BEHIND THE LANGUAGE ACCESS IS

WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE

UPDATE ON ITS THREE YEAR CYCLE

00:57:30.013 --> 00:57:33.016

00:57:33.082 --> 00:57:35.552
IS THAT BAD STAFF WILL NOT HAVE

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:37.954

BUT THEY WILL BE PROVIDING

00:57:41.858 --> 00:57:43.193
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO WE

00:57:43.259 --> 00:57:44.360
BELIEVE THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:46.529
THE CAPACITY TO DO BOTH OF

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:48.464
THOSE THINGS OF THAT TIME BY

00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:50.266
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND THEN.

00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:51.968
ALSO THERE IS A GRANT THAT'S

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:53.236
REALLY ACTUALLY UNDER WAY

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.704
ALREADY B. I. C. C. IS DOING

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:56.806
SOME OF THIS WORK NOW AND

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:58.942
THAT'S A ONE TIME GRANT AND

00:57:59.008 --> 00:58:00.910
THAT'S REALLY SOME RESOURCES

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:02.278
FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TO

00:58:02.345 --> 00:58:03.880
DEVELOP INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:05.448
FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:07.884
THEY CAN BE PREPARED TO ANSWER

00:58:07.951 --> 00:58:11.654
THESE FOLKS LOCALLY- AND SO THE

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:12.889
SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION IS

00:58:12.956 --> 00:58:14.123
HOW DO WE DETERMINE OUR

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:17.193
STAFFING LEVELS- AND- I THINK-

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.995
WE FELT IT WAS REALLY AFFECTED

00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:21.364
TO DIVIDE THE OFFICE INTO TWO

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:23.566
UNITS THAT WERE LED BY. AN

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:25.335
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:26.536
COUNTY COORDINATION UNIT WHICH

00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:28.404
I KIND OF SPOKEN ABOUT QUITE A

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:30.874
BIT WHICH- I SIX LIAISONS THAT

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.542
CAN WORK WITH THE FIFTY EIGHT

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:34.811
COUNTIES TO REVIEW THEIR-

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:36.346
REALIGNMENT BROUGHT BLOCK GRANT

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:38.314
PROGRAMS. AND THEY ALSO THE

00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:39.716
KIND OF PRIMARY POINT OF

00:58:39.782 --> 00:58:41.050
CONTACT FOR TECHNICAL

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:42.752
ASSISTANCE. THEN WE HAVE A

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:44.888
POLICY RESEARCH OPERATIONS UNIT

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:46.890
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. THE

00:58:46.956 --> 00:58:48.858
OFFICE HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:50.260
OF RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO

00:58:50.326 --> 00:58:53.162
BEST PRACTICES- AND ALSO-

LEGISLATURE IN ANALYZING THE

00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:58.234
ADVOCACY PROGRAMS. AND SO THIS

00:58:58.301 --> 00:58:59.535
IS REALLY WHAT THIS YOUNG UNIT

00:58:59.602 --> 00:59:07.277
WOULD. BE FOCUSED ON- AND THAT

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:08.444
IS ALL THE AREA OF OUR OFFICE

00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:09.913
THAT WOULD. INCLUDE AND JUST

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:15.998
PRESENTING AN EMERGENCY

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.668
SITUATION AND THE OFFICE MAY

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:20.536

DIRECTLY WITH THE FACILITY

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.218
ADMINISTRATORS TO TRY TO

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:37.753
RESOLVE ANY ISSUES I THINK IT'S

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:40.656
IMPORTANT PART OF OUR TA AGENDA

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:41.991
TO USE THE INFORMATION THAT

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:42.725
WE'RE GETTING FROM THOSE

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.460

RECOGNIZE THAT THERE STEP THERE

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.534
CERTAINLY MAY BE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:52.702
IN WHICH COMPLAINTS NEED TO BE

01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:55.204
REFERRED WE HAVE AN ATTORNEY-

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:56.772
WITHIN THE OFFICE THAT CAN HELP

01:02:56.839 --> 01:03:00.176
ASSIST. WITH GUIDING US ON WHAT

01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:01.310
WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE

01:03:01.377 --> 01:03:03.546
REFERRAL- I THINK THAT IT'S

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:04.647
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:07.950
BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO-

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:09.018
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:10.920
THE CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH IN

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:13.222
THE OFFICE AND TO GET BACK

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:15.358
ITEMS- THE OTHER THING I WOULD

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:16.292
SAY ABOUT THIS JUST REAL

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:18.327
QUICKLY IS THAT THE OFFICE IS

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:20.329
REQUIRED. TO PROVIDE REGULAR

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:21.731
REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:03:21.797 --> 01:03:23.199
ABOUT A VARIETY OF THINGS BUT

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:24.500
IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:29.672
COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED AND.

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:30.273
THE FINDINGS AND ACTIONS THAT

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:31.140
WE'VE TAKEN. SO WITH THAT I

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:31.941
BELIEVE I AM ALL THE QUESTIONS

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:34.544
AND- WANT TO OPEN UP AND MAKE

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:35.845
SURE THAT THERE AREN'T ANY MORE

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.313
QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT IN THAT

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.115
AND WE WANT TO WELCOME A DOCTOR

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:41.050
PANELIST WHO'S JOINED US LIVE

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:43.786
IN THE HEARING ROOM- AND WHEN

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:45.254
HE WAS COMING AND I MAY HAVE

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.155
MISSED IT BUT I KNOW SOMETIMES

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:48.691
WE SET UP. OVERSIGHTSIT AND AS

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:50.459
WE KNOW ALL COUNTIES ARE NOT.

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:52.094
CREATED EQUAL OR HAVE THE SAME

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.729
AMOUNTOF RESOURCES OR ABILITY.

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:54.830
THE PLAN TO WHILE WE'RE

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:56.666
PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:03:56.732 --> 01:03:59.902
AND THEN BRINGING IN DATA. WITH

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:00.803
THE REALIGNMENT. WILL WE

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.171
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO IF COUNTIES

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:03.706
ARE NOT PERFORMING WHAT THEY'RE

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.274
SUPPOSED TO BE PERFORMING TO

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:06.542
WITHHOLD FUNDING OR OR- WELL

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:09.078
THIS WILL IS ACTUALLY HAVE

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:15.985
TEETH. WELL I BELIEVE THAT- WE

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:17.420
WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:21.424
INVESTIGATE- ISSUES CERTAINLY

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:22.558
IF THERE ARE EMERGENCY

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:25.328
SITUATIONS VIOLATIONS OF LAW

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:26.996
AND THAT WE HAVE PLACES THAT WE

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:28.264
CAN GO THERE OBVIOUSLY ARE

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:29.966
ENTITIES THAT REGULATE THESE

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:33.269
FACILITIES- AND SO I BELIEVE

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:36.672
YOU KNOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:38.908
ADDRESS THAT- THIS IS. THESE

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:40.443
ARE SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:41.877
PROVIDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:43.012
THINK THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:45.481
IS THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:47.083
SUPPORT THE COUNTIES TO BE AS

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:49.051
SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE IN THIS

01:04:49.118 --> 01:04:50.186
AND THAT REQUIRES THE

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:59.629
RESOURCES- AND DAD. THAT'S MY

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:02.064
ANSWER TO THAT. OKAY SO NOT

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:03.633
QUITE WE DON'T QUITE HAVE HAVE

01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:05.468
TEETH BUT BUT WE HOPE THE

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:07.003
COUNTIES WILL PROVIDE THE

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.104
SERVICES SO OUR YOUTH AND

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.805
FAMILIES. CAN BE THEIR MOST

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:11.307
SUCCESSFUL AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:13.776
LOOK TO LOOK FOR WAYS. TO HELP

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:16.512
COUNTIES AND CONSTITUENTS BE

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:16.979
SUCCESSFUL BUT WHAT I

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:19.649
UNDERSTAND. YES AND OF COURSE

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:21.484
WE WILL BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.985
WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE I

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:24.487
THINK THREE DIFFERENT REPORTS

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:27.790
THAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE- AND-

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:30.393
AGAIN IF THERE ARE VIOLATIONS

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:32.995
OF LAW- CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:34.430
PRESENTED AN EMERGENCY OF

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:36.432
COURSE. OUR OFFICE WOULD

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:37.800
ABSOLUTELY BE RESPONSIVE TO

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:40.102
THAT. OKAY BECAUSE WE ARE WE'RE

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:43.039
NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE- USE

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:46.242
IN RESIDENTIAL KIND OF SERVICES

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:48.311
CORRECT IT'S A BROAD SPECTRUM.

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:50.413
THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION HAS

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:52.348
A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NEEDS

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:54.083
AND THEY ALSO WORK FOR THE MOST

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:55.384
PART HAVE COMMITTED MORE

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:57.787
SERIOUS FELONIES. AND SO THESE

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:59.655
ARE LIKELY PEOPLE WHO WILL BE

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:02.291
HOUSED IN FACILITIES- FOR AT

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:04.860
LEAST PORTIONS OF THE OF THAT

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:05.361
TIME IN WHICH THEY ARE

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:10.433
REHABILITATING. AND SO AS I I'M

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:12.168
NOT EXACTLY SURE THE SCOPE OF

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:12.968
ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:14.737
FACILITIES CERTAINLY MANY OF

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:18.974
THEM WILL BE OBVIOUSLY.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:19.542
RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS IN THE

01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:21.077
COMMUNITY. A QUESTION AND I AM

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:23.145
I AM I HOPE WOULD JUST BE THAT.

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:25.448
AGAIN BEST PRACTICES WOULD SAY

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:27.583
THAT WHATEVER FACILITY UP TO

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.885
YOU THIS IN. THE END THE

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:30.720
INTEGRATION BACK INTO THE

01:06:30.786 --> 01:06:32.521
COMMUNITY HAS TO START SOONER

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:33.989
THAN LATER AND THAT'S BEEN ONE

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:35.691
OF I THINK OUR STUMBLES ON

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:36.959
OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE STOOD UP

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:38.828
THAT PEOPLE COME OUT AND THEN

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:40.596
THEY ARE JUST KIND OF. SWEPT

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:41.964
AWAY WITHOUT ANYTHING OR THE

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:43.165
MORE WE TRY TO CONNECT THEM TO

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:45.534
SERVICES AFTER THEY'RE OUT AND

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:46.769
OFTENTIMES FOR A VARIETY OF

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.104
REASONS. THERE'S A LACK OF

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.473
FOLLOW THROUGH SO DO WE HAVE

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:51.540
THE MEANS TO BE ABLE TO. I'M

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:53.442
SAY MANDATE BUT BUT REALLY

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.511
ENCOURAGED THAT THOSE

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:56.078
CONNECTIONS ARE MADE SOONER

01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:58.848
THAN LATER. ACTUALLY THE PLANTS

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:00.649
REQUIRE THEM TO FOCUS ON RE

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:02.818
ENTRY SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:04.820
RE ENTRY IT SHOULD BEGIN WITH

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:06.355
YOUR ENTRY INTO THE JUSTICE

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:08.624
SYSTEM- I THINK THAT'S THE BEST

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:09.692
PRACTICE THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:11.227
MOVING TOWARDS AND THAT THE

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:12.661
THAT THE REHABILITATION AND THE

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:14.764
WORK THAT WE DO- WHILE SOME OF

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:16.766
THIS IS IT WITHIN OUR CUSTODY

01:07:16.832 --> 01:07:19.802
OR OVER SUPERVISION- EVERYTHING

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:20.736
SHOULD BE GEARED TOWARDS

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:22.238
FOCUSING ON SUCCESSFUL RE

01:07:22.304 --> 01:07:24.640
ENTRY- AND THAT IS PART OF THE-

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:25.708
THAT IS PART OF THE PLAN THAT

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:28.811
THE COUNTY MUST ADMIT. THAT WE

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.179
WILL BE REVIEWING AND AGAIN

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:31.547
FORGIVE ME IF I MISSED IT THAT

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:35.684

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:37.286

THAT THIS STATUTE DICTATES THAT

THERE MUST BE A LOCAL COMMITTEE

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:14.723

ANTICIPATE WITH THE STATEWIDE

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:37.533
METRICS WOULD BE DEVELOPED SO

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.901
THAT FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE WITH

A TIME LINE I THINK WOULD BE

01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:07.496
IMPORTANT FOR OUR DELIBERATIONS

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:09.031
BEFORE WE FINALIZE BUDGET TO

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.466

WANT TO HELP. PROGRAM WHICH HAS

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:46.602
BEEN OVERFUNDED OR IF YOU ARE A

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:47.903
NUMBER OF YEARS AND YOU

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.304
CONSEQUENCES THAT IS WE HAVE A

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:52.341
NUMBER MANY MANY AB ONE

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:56.979
THOUSAND NOW. ONE WAS. LIVING

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.181
ON THE SOME ISSUES THAT YOU CAN

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:03.852
YOUR NOT. I THINK WE- OF THE

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:06.789
AND THE REQUESTED- COUNTIES

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:09.558
WERE NOT FROM TO BRING TO

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:11.060
ADEQUATELY. ADDRESS THEM OF THE

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:13.462
ON NOW WE HAVE THE YOUTH

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:18.167
SUFFICIENT POINTED OUT SOME OF

01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:19.601
THE MOST- THE BEER RESPONSES

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:21.937
HAVE BEEN COMMITTED. AND BEGAN

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.539
OPPORTUNITY QUESTIONS DOWN TO

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:24.773
THE COUNTY LEVEL WHERE

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.542
RESOURCES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:28.143
I'M JUST WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOU

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:31.780
TALK ABOUT WHY YOU THINK THAT

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.215
THIS TIME- YOU THINK IT WILL BE

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:35.417
A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO DO WHAT

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:39.221
WHAT EXPERIENCE. IT WAS A

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.556
LITTLE BIT HARD TO HEAR YOU BUT

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:42.124
I THINK I GOT THE MOST OF IT

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:43.358
WHICH WAS TALKING ABOUT YOUR

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.060
CONCERNS THAT THERE MAY NOT BE

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:47.062
ENOUGH RESOURCES LOCALLY TO

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:50.432
SEVERITIES KIDS ADEQUATELY- I

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.601
THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:54.603
WOULD ALSO- WHAT I WOULD ALSO

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.205
SAY IS THAT WE KNOW THAT IT'S A

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:58.240
MUCH BETTER USE OF FUNDS TO

01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:00.042
SERVE THESE. CHILDREN OR YOUNG

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:03.011
PEOPLE- LOCALLY AT IT

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:05.080
ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO. SAVE A

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:06.548
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DOLLARS

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:07.883
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THESE

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.585
INDIVIDUALS GRADUATING INTO THE

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.386
ADULT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:12.287
WHETHER THAT BE THROUGH LOCAL

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:16.058
JAILS- AND OR BUT UNFORTUNATELY

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:17.526
MAYBE EVEN ENDING UP IN ANY OF

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:21.263
OUR STATE FACILITIES- AND SO. I

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:24.666
THINK THAT- THIS IS AN AN

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:27.169
OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT RESEARCH

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.937
WOULD SAY IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:30.706
WAY TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:33.242
THAT ULTIMATELY. IS GOING TO

01:13:33.308 --> 01:13:35.544
SAVE THAT THE LOCAL. COUNTY

01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:37.780
MONEY BUT ALSO BE. IN THE BEST

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:38.914
INTEREST OF THE YOUTH AND THE

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:39.915
FAMILIES AND I THINK

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:43.085
GENERATIONS OF FAMILIES- AND SO

IN. HIS MANY AS TWO OR THREE OF

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:57.591
THESE CATEGORIES BUT MANY OF

HAPPEN IS- SOME OF THE FUNDING

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:27.521
FOR THIS OVER THE COURSE OF

01:40:27.588 --> 01:40:29.123
FIVE YEARS HAS HAS DRIED UP IN

01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:31.759

BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE PRIMARILY

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:38.198
BASED ON FUNDING ISSUES. I

01:40:38.265 --> 01:40:42.736
THINK THE MOST COMMON OF THIS

01:40:42.803 --> 01:40:44.171

TECHNOLOGIST ETCETERA. THE IS

01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:28.775
THERE GOING TO BE ON GOING

01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:30.043

THESE. REPORT QUALITY

02:11:45.197 --> 02:11:47.099
PERFORMANCE AND EQUITY METRICS

02:11:47.165 --> 02:11:48.934
ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

02:11:49.001 --> 02:11:50.402
ADVANCE PAYMENT MODELS THAT

02:11:50.469 --> 02:11:51.937
REWARD HIGH QUALITY COST

02:11:52.004 --> 02:11:53.872
EFFICIENT CARE AND PROMOTE

02:11:53.939 --> 02:11:56.308
INVESTMENTS IN PRIMARY CARE AND

02:11:56.375 --> 02:11:58.176
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. STAKEHOLDER

02:11:58.243 --> 02:11:59.745
ENGAGEMENT WILL BE CRITICAL TO

02:11:59.811 --> 02:12:02.114
THE SUCCESS OF THE OFFENSE WE

02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:03.882
DO HOPE TO RELEASE TRAILER BILL

02:12:03.949 --> 02:12:05.651
LANGUAGE VERY SHORTLY AND LOOK

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:07.819

THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:10.088
STAKEHOLDERS. BUT THERE ARE

02:12:10.155 --> 02:12:11.290
SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:12:11.356 --> 02:12:12.557
THE OFFICE THAT I'LL GO AHEAD

02:12:12.624 --> 02:12:13.692

HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

02:12:20.399 --> 02:12:22.367
OF COURSE. IN TERMS OF HOW THE

02:12:22.434 --> 02:12:25.203
OFFICE WOULD SET COST TARGETS-

02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:27.706
WE WOULD COLLECT DATA- AND SET

02:12:27.773 --> 02:12:29.508
AN OVERALL HEALTH CARE COSTS

02:12:29.574 --> 02:12:30.976
TARGET GROWTH FOR PER CAPITA

SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:12:33.178 --> 02:12:34.413
THEN HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO

02:12:34.479 --> 02:12:36.248
SET SECTOR AND REGION SPECIFIC

02:12:36.315 --> 02:12:38.684
TARGETS. SO THE TARGETS WOULD

02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:41.286
BE BASED ON- A PARTICULAR OR A

02:12:41.353 --> 02:12:42.954
COMBINATION OF ECONOMIC

02:12:43.021 --> 02:12:44.690
INDICATORS SUCH AS GROSS STATE

02:12:44.756 --> 02:12:46.391

02:12:46.458 --> 02:12:48.327
INDEX THE OTHER STATES THAT

02:12:48.393 --> 02:12:50.495
HAVE IMPLEMENTED A SIMILAR COST

02:12:50.562 --> 02:12:51.997
GROWTH TARGET HAS HAVE TO HAVE

02:12:52.064 --> 02:12:54.266
TAKEN DIFFERENT CHOICES- OR

02:12:54.333 --> 02:12:55.467
SOMETIMES HAVE GONE ABOVE OR

02:12:55.534 --> 02:12:58.870
BELOW. A GIVEN ECONOMIC

02:12:58.937 --> 02:13:00.172
INDICATOR. THE SENATE OF

02:13:00.238 --> 02:13:01.406
DIFFERENT TARGETS WILL BE BY

02:13:01.473 --> 02:13:03.375
HISTORICAL COST DATA AND OTHER

02:13:03.442 --> 02:13:04.710
RELEVANT DATA WITH

02:13:04.776 --> 02:13:06.311
CONSIDERATION AGAIN FOR A FOR

02:13:06.378 --> 02:13:09.781
ACCESS QUALITY EQUITY AND WORK

02:13:09.848 --> 02:13:12.517
FOR STABILITY. THE METHODOLOGY

02:13:12.584 --> 02:13:14.119
AND PROCESS FOR REVIEWING AND

02:13:14.186 --> 02:13:15.253
UPDATING THE COST GROWTH

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:16.922
TARGETS WILL BE INFORMED BY

02:13:16.988 --> 02:13:19.491
STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPORT EXPERTS

02:13:19.558 --> 02:13:22.194
THE REVISED REPORT. SO WE

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:23.528
WAITED TO BE OFFICE WILL BEGIN

02:13:23.595 --> 02:13:27.432
SETTING THE BENCHMARK TARGET IN

02:13:27.499 --> 02:13:28.033
TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR CALENDAR

02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:29.801
YEAR TWENTY THREE. AND THEN

02:13:29.868 --> 02:13:30.936
BEGIN COLLECTING TOTAL

02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:32.537
HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE DATA

02:13:32.604 --> 02:13:34.573
FROM PAYERS AND WE WOULD HAVE

02:13:34.639 --> 02:13:35.841
THEM BREAK IT DOWN BY SERVICE

02:13:35.907 --> 02:13:37.776
CATEGORY SUCH AS HOSPITAL CARE

02:13:37.843 --> 02:13:41.513
INPATIENT OUTPATIENT PHYSICIAN

02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:43.115
SERVICES AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

02:13:43.181 --> 02:13:44.182
THE COST TARGETS MAY BE

02:13:44.249 --> 02:13:45.784
ADJUSTED FOR INDIVIDUAL HEALTH

02:13:45.851 --> 02:13:47.986
CARE ENTITIES ONE WARRANTED TO

02:13:48.053 --> 02:13:49.187
ACCOUNT FOR THE ENTITIES

02:13:49.254 --> 02:13:51.790
BASELINE COSTS IN COMPARISON TO

02:13:51.857 --> 02:13:53.058
OTHER HEALTHCARE ENTITIES THAT

02:13:53.125 --> 02:13:54.760
OUR REGION OR HEALTH CARE

02:13:54.826 --> 02:13:58.463
SECTORS. THE NEXT QUESTION ASKS

02:13:58.530 --> 02:14:00.065
HOW THE COMPLIANCE AND PENALTY

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:02.267
PROCESSES WOULD BE ENFORCED

02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:03.235
SPECIFICALLY AT THE PROVIDER

02:14:03.301 --> 02:14:05.937
LEVEL- SO IN COMBINATION WITH

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:08.073
THE DATA REPORTED BY PAYERS THE

02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:09.274
OFFICE WOULD ALSO BE GETTING

02:14:09.341 --> 02:14:10.876
AUDITED FINANCIAL REPORTS FROM

02:14:10.942 --> 02:14:12.778
PROVIDERS TO DETERMINE HOW

02:14:12.844 --> 02:14:15.113
PROVIDERS ARE PERFORMING

02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:16.748
AGAINST THAT COST TARGET. TO

02:14:16.815 --> 02:14:18.550
THE EXTENT OF PROVIDER EXCEEDED

02:14:18.617 --> 02:14:20.452
THE COST TARGET ENFORCEMENT

02:14:20.519 --> 02:14:22.687
WOULD BE VERY MUCH PROGRESSIVE

02:14:22.754 --> 02:14:23.622
SO IT WOULD BEGIN WITH

02:14:23.688 --> 02:14:25.056
ASSISTANCE TO BRING THE

02:14:25.123 --> 02:14:27.626
PROVIDER INTO COMPLIANCE-

02:14:27.692 --> 02:14:29.795
LOOKING AT THE DATA. MAKING

02:14:29.861 --> 02:14:31.596
SURE IT'S ALL CORRECT HAVING

02:14:31.663 --> 02:14:33.064
THE PROVIDER SUBMIT A CORRECTED

02:14:33.131 --> 02:14:35.767
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS- AND IF

02:14:35.834 --> 02:14:36.768
THAT DOES NOT RESOLVE THE

02:14:36.835 --> 02:14:40.372
ISSUES THEN. THERE IS THE

02:14:40.439 --> 02:14:44.075
ABILITY TO ASSESS PENALTIES. IN

02:14:44.142 --> 02:14:45.911
TERMS OF WHAT DATA WOULD BE.

02:14:45.977 --> 02:14:48.413
USED TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:49.214
AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE AN

02:14:49.281 --> 02:14:51.149
APPEALS PROCESS THE OFFICE

02:14:51.216 --> 02:14:52.417
WOULD DETERMINE OMPLIANCE

02:14:52.484 --> 02:14:53.885
USING DATA COLLECTED BY THE

02:14:53.952 --> 02:14:56.721
OFFICE- AGAIN. A LARGELY FROM

02:14:56.788 --> 02:14:58.356
THAT FROM THE HEALTH CARE

02:14:58.423 --> 02:15:00.492
ENTITY ITSELF. AND THEN THROUGH

02:15:00.559 --> 02:15:01.593
THE PROGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT

02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:03.562
PROCESS THE HEALTH CARE ENTITY

02:15:03.628 --> 02:15:04.963
WOULD HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:07.365
REVIEW AND SEE CORRECTION- WITH

02:15:07.432 --> 02:15:09.568
THE OFFICE. THERE CERTAINLY

02:15:09.634 --> 02:15:11.903
WOULD BE AN APPEALS PROCESS SO

02:15:11.970 --> 02:15:13.104
WE WOULD WE WOULD ASSESS THE

02:15:13.171 --> 02:15:14.506
PENALTY AND THEN THERE WOULD BE

02:15:14.573 --> 02:15:16.074
FORMAL DUE PROCESS

02:15:16.141 --> 02:15:17.542
OPPORTUNITIES TO CHALLENGE AND

02:15:17.609 --> 02:15:19.544
NON COMPLIANCE DETERMINATION

02:15:19.611 --> 02:15:21.713
INCLUDING ADMINISTRATORS. AND

02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:23.882
ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS AND

02:15:23.949 --> 02:15:26.017
RIGHTS FOR THE- SO THOSE ARE

02:15:26.084 --> 02:15:27.519
THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE IN THE

02:15:27.586 --> 02:15:29.287
AGENDA I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY

02:15:29.354 --> 02:15:32.891
OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK

02:15:32.958 --> 02:15:34.793
YOU- IT APPRECIATE THE

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:36.294
PRESENTATION I KNOW THAT THIS

02:15:36.361 --> 02:15:37.362
WAS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S

02:15:37.429 --> 02:15:39.965
PROPOSAL- AT LEAST BECAUSE IT

02:15:40.031 --> 02:15:41.266
WAS AN OFFICE OF AFFORDABILITY

02:15:41.333 --> 02:15:42.634
I THINK THERE WASN'T AS MUCH

02:15:42.701 --> 02:15:46.438
DETAIL- AND THE LAST. PROPOSAL

02:15:46.505 --> 02:15:47.672
AND THEN OF COURSE CODE HERE. I

02:15:47.739 --> 02:15:49.674
GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE WELL

02:15:49.741 --> 02:15:51.877
I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND-

02:15:51.943 --> 02:15:52.677
AND HOPE THAT WE CAN GET

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:54.546
CLARITY ON THIS IS- THE BUDGET

02:15:54.613 --> 02:15:56.715
PROCESS MOVES FORWARD AND I

02:15:56.781 --> 02:16:00.218
KNOW THAT- MY COMPATRIOT-

02:16:00.285 --> 02:16:01.586
ASSEMBLY CHAIRS THE SENATE

02:16:01.653 --> 02:16:02.587
HEALTH COMMITTEE IS ALSO

02:16:02.654 --> 02:16:04.089
WORKING ON SOME OF LEGISLATION

02:16:04.155 --> 02:16:05.657
AS WELL SO. I THINK WE NEED TO

02:16:05.724 --> 02:16:07.792
LOOK AT THESE IN THE POLICY

02:16:07.859 --> 02:16:08.426
CONTACTS AS WELL AS THE BUDGET

02:16:08.493 --> 02:16:10.695
CONTEXT. BUT I'LL I WOULD MAKE

02:16:10.762 --> 02:16:13.331
NOTES THAT- YOU TALKED ABOUT

02:16:13.398 --> 02:16:15.133
THE STATUS IN CART COST TARGETS

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.569
IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. BUT AS I

02:16:17.636 --> 02:16:20.205
JUST ASKED HER COLLEAGUES- FOR

02:16:20.272 --> 02:16:21.640
THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE

02:16:21.706 --> 02:16:23.475
WE DON'T EXPECT THAT TO GET UP

02:16:23.542 --> 02:16:25.577
UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO

02:16:25.644 --> 02:16:26.745
THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCONNECT

02:16:26.811 --> 02:16:28.280
THERE AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU

02:16:28.346 --> 02:16:29.848
SAID THAT YOU GUYS COLLECTED

02:16:29.915 --> 02:16:31.550
DATA FROM THE HEALTH CARE

02:16:31.616 --> 02:16:34.586
ENTITIES THEMSELVES. BUT IT S.

02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:36.388
FIND IT. INTERESTS ME I GUESS

02:16:36.454 --> 02:16:37.589
I'LL FIND IT CHALLENGING TO

02:16:37.656 --> 02:16:38.490
THINK THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY

02:16:38.557 --> 02:16:40.525
DON'T HAVE DATA ON THE OVERALL

02:16:40.592 --> 02:16:41.860
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT NOW

02:16:41.927 --> 02:16:43.194
THERE STILL BE SOME LIMITATIONS

02:16:43.261 --> 02:16:44.963
ON ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE.

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:47.799
THE LARGER PICTURE UNTIL TWENTY

02:16:47.866 --> 02:16:48.366
TWENTY THREE AND WE'VE BEEN

02:16:48.433 --> 02:16:49.434
WORKING ON BUILDING THIS

02:16:49.501 --> 02:16:50.869
DATABASE OVER TIME AND THIS IS

02:16:50.936 --> 02:16:51.870
NOT THE FIRST YEAR WE'RE

02:16:51.937 --> 02:16:53.338
STARTING ON THAT SO IT DOES

02:16:53.405 --> 02:16:54.406
TAKE TIME AND EFFORT TO DO

02:16:54.472 --> 02:16:55.807
THAT. BUT YET WE'RE GONNA BE

02:16:55.874 --> 02:16:57.676
SETTING COST TARGETS A YEAR

02:16:57.742 --> 02:17:00.078
BEFORE WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA.

02:17:00.145 --> 02:17:01.046
TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS COST

02:17:01.112 --> 02:17:02.514
TARGETS MAKES SENSE AND HOW

02:17:02.581 --> 02:17:03.014
THEY FIT IN THE OVERALL

02:17:03.081 --> 02:17:06.251
PICTURE. SO AND THEN WE'RE

02:17:06.318 --> 02:17:08.153
ACTUALLY GONNA FORCE PEOPLE

02:17:08.219 --> 02:17:09.754
BEFORE EVEN HAVE THE OVERALL

02:17:09.821 --> 02:17:12.424
PICTURE- SO I WOULD ALSO MAKE

02:17:12.490 --> 02:17:13.892
NOTE THAT IN THIS BUDGET

02:17:13.959 --> 02:17:17.362
PROPOSAL- THAT- ACTUALLY WELL

02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:18.930
AS THE SECOND LARGEST SECTION

02:17:18.997 --> 02:17:20.231
YOU KNOW PART OF THE BUDGET OF

02:17:20.298 --> 02:17:21.499
THE STAFFING REQUEST IS

02:17:21.566 --> 02:17:22.434
ACTUALLY THE INVESTIGATION

02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:24.169
ENFORCEMENT BRANCH I GUESS THE

02:17:24.235 --> 02:17:25.937
FOLLOWS AFTER THE I. T.

02:17:26.004 --> 02:17:27.105
BRANCHES WITH THE L. FOURTEEN

02:17:27.172 --> 02:17:28.406
POSITIONS FOLLOWED BY FORTY

02:17:28.473 --> 02:17:33.478
FOUR POSITIONS. THE FOLLOWING

02:17:33.545 --> 02:17:34.112
FIVE EIGHT FIFTY TWO POSITIONS.

02:17:34.179 --> 02:17:34.746
SO I GUESS CONCERN IS THAT AND

02:17:34.813 --> 02:17:38.016
I. YOUR A PRESS- BUT MY CONCERN

02:17:38.083 --> 02:17:41.519
IS THAT- WERE. GETTING A LITTLE

02:17:41.586 --> 02:17:43.054
AHEAD OF OURSELVES NOT FOR OF

02:17:43.121 --> 02:17:44.489
TERMS AFFORDABILITY IF NOT

02:17:44.556 --> 02:17:46.191
OPPOSED TO THE IDEA IN OFFICE

02:17:46.257 --> 02:17:47.993
AFFORDABILITY. BUT THAT OUR

02:17:48.059 --> 02:17:49.694
APPROACH IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:17:49.761 --> 02:17:51.696
SET COST TARGETS IN THE ABSENCE

02:17:51.763 --> 02:17:55.033
OF- GOOD DATA. AND I WILL TELL

02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:55.934
YOU TO SOMEONE WHO STUDY

02:17:56.001 --> 02:17:57.068
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT YOU KNOW

02:17:57.135 --> 02:17:58.336
WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS WE TRY TO

02:17:58.403 --> 02:17:59.738
MOVE FROM WHAT WE CALL EVIDENCE

02:17:59.804 --> 02:18:01.473
BASED MEDICINE WHICH IS PEOPLE

02:18:01.539 --> 02:18:03.441
LIKE- WE GOT. YOU KNOW EXPERTS

02:18:03.508 --> 02:18:05.777
AND FAMOUS PEOPLE OF

02:18:05.844 --> 02:18:06.611
PROCLAIMING WHAT SHOULD BE.

02:18:06.678 --> 02:18:09.147
VERSUS EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE

02:18:09.214 --> 02:18:10.048
WHICH IS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT

02:18:10.115 --> 02:18:12.217
THE DATA. SO I GUESS MY CONCERN

02:18:12.283 --> 02:18:13.752
IS WE ACTUALLY COST TARGETS

02:18:13.818 --> 02:18:16.021
BASED ON EVIDENCE. PEOPLE WHO.

02:18:16.087 --> 02:18:17.889
ARE SELF PROCLAIMED EXPERTS AND

02:18:17.956 --> 02:18:18.957
YEAH PRAYER DO HAVE ACTUALLY

02:18:19.024 --> 02:18:20.925
SOME EXPERTISE. BUT IN THE

02:18:20.992 --> 02:18:21.960

HEALTHCARE BUT NOW I'M GOING

02:23:35.139 --> 02:23:37.175
CREEK COST TARGETS THAT ARE

02:23:37.241 --> 02:23:38.843
BASED ON. JUST THE EXPERIENCE

02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:40.278
OF THE LARGE IDENTITIES AND

02:23:40.345 --> 02:23:41.412
WHAT'S GOING ON SMALLER

02:23:41.479 --> 02:23:43.214
ENTITIES IN FACT OFTENTIMES IS

02:23:43.281 --> 02:23:44.315

MOM AND POP STUFF GOING ON

02:23:51.856 --> 02:23:53.224
BECAUSE- THE PEOPLE WHO

02:23:53.291 --> 02:23:54.659
ACTUALLY ARE LARGER WITH MORE

02:23:54.726 --> 02:23:55.660
MONEY TEND TO GO TO MIDDLE

02:23:55.727 --> 02:23:57.428
CLASS AREAS THERE'S MORE MONEY

02:23:57.495 --> 02:24:01.799
THERE. SO AT SO I IT JUST. I

02:24:01.866 --> 02:24:02.834

02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:04.035
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TAKING A

02:24:04.102 --> 02:24:04.769
LOT OF THOUGHT I THINK THERE'S

02:24:04.836 --> 02:24:06.971
A LOT OF THOUGHT. ABOUT HOW WE

02:24:07.038 --> 02:24:08.473
GO ABOUT DOING THIS SO THAT.

02:24:08.539 --> 02:24:09.974
AND AS WE'RE TRYING TO APPROACH

02:24:10.041 --> 02:24:12.977
THIS IT THE ISSUE AFFORDABILITY

02:24:13.044 --> 02:24:14.512
THAT WE DON'T MAKE DECISIONS

02:24:14.579 --> 02:24:16.247
BASED ON INCOMPLETE OR

02:24:16.314 --> 02:24:18.716
DISTORTED DATA. ESPECIALLY IF

02:24:18.783 --> 02:24:20.118

PENALTIES AND I KNOW AND I

02:24:21.786 --> 02:24:22.920
APPRECIATE THE STAGE THEN

02:24:22.987 --> 02:24:23.921
YOU'RE NOT JUST HITTING PEOPLE

02:24:23.988 --> 02:24:24.856
IN THE HAMMER WITH WITH THE

02:24:24.922 --> 02:24:27.859
RIGHT AWAY. BUT IT CAN CAUSE-

02:24:27.925 --> 02:24:28.860
YOU KNOW WE HAVE DISTORTIONS

02:24:28.926 --> 02:24:30.428
AND DATA AND THEN THERE'S

02:24:30.495 --> 02:24:32.430
CONSEQUENCES TO PEOPLE. THEN

02:24:32.497 --> 02:24:34.465
YOU START GETTING- BEHAVIORS

02:24:34.532 --> 02:24:36.234
THAT ARE- NOT NECESSARILY

02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:37.902
OPTIMAL FOR CARE YOU GET

02:24:37.969 --> 02:24:39.871

THAT TO HAPPEN EITHER. BUT I

CLAIMS DATABASE THAT'S ALSO

02:26:04.155 --> 02:26:05.656
THAT BACKS TO THE- PURPOSE OF

02:26:05.723 --> 02:26:08.226
AN OFF FAIR CLAIMS DATABASE IS.

02:26:08.292 --> 02:26:09.327

COMPLIANCE- THERE'S A LOT THAT

02:38:14.685 --> 02:38:15.752
WE WILL BE DOING IN TERMS OF

02:38:15.819 --> 02:38:17.821
OUR REPORTING OUT I'M NOT. ONCE

02:38:17.888 --> 02:38:19.556

THAT SO. AGAIN WE COME A LONG

02:38:24.962 --> 02:38:26.763
WAY ON THE DATA ERRORS AND WE

02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:28.732
CONTINUE TO WORK- THROUGH THAT.

02:38:28.799 --> 02:38:30.100
AND JUST A REMINDER TO THAT

02:38:30.167 --> 02:38:31.935
WHEN WE WHEN PLANS HAVE DATA

02:38:32.002 --> 02:38:33.203
ISSUES WE ALSO DO MAKE

02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:34.438
REFERRALS TO OUR OFFICE OF

02:38:34.504 --> 02:38:35.672

THAT FOR FULL SERVICE HEALTH

02:38:47.150 --> 02:38:48.485
PLAN- WE HAVE WAIT TIMES THE-

02:38:48.552 --> 02:38:51.488

02:38:51.555 --> 02:38:53.891
NEWS ONLY 52% AND FOR URGENT

02:38:53.957 --> 02:38:57.060
APPOINTMENTS- THE WAIT TIME-

02:38:57.127 --> 02:38:59.563
THE SURVEY PROVIDERS AGAIN GOOD

02:38:59.630 --> 02:39:00.964
92% ALTHOUGH SOME WOULD ARGUE

02:39:01.031 --> 02:39:02.266
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A

02:39:02.332 --> 02:39:02.933
MINIMUM STANDARD SHOULD ALWAYS

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.202
BE A HUNDRED PERCENT. AND THEN

02:39:05.269 --> 02:39:07.070
TO A LOW OF FORTY FIVE PERCENT.

02:39:07.137 --> 02:39:08.906
SO AND THESE ARE BECAUSE THE

02:39:08.972 --> 02:39:11.108
MINIMUM STANDARDS. SO CAN YOU

02:39:11.174 --> 02:39:14.111

REGULATIONS SOON MAYBE CAN

02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:17.281
MATCH WHAT THE TIME LINE IS FOR

02:39:17.347 --> 02:39:19.816
THAT. BUT SO WHAT ARE THE

02:39:19.883 --> 02:39:21.618
CONSEQUENCES WHEN YOU HAVE.

02:39:21.685 --> 02:39:23.887
CURRENTLY SOME PLANS REPORTING.

02:39:23.954 --> 02:39:25.122

OUT THE URGENT- THAT IN TERMS

02:39:30.994 --> 02:39:32.462
OF NOT MEETING THE STATE TIMELY

ACCESS. STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE

02:39:36.266 --> 02:39:38.669
IN PLACE. I REQUEST SO A COUPLE

02:39:38.735 --> 02:39:40.304
OF THINGS- ONCE WE HAVE THE

02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:41.838
REGULATION OF THIS FINAL WE

02:39:41.905 --> 02:39:43.240
WILL WE WILL FINALLY HAVE A

02:39:43.307 --> 02:39:44.908
RATE OF COMPLIANCE THAT IS A

02:39:44.975 --> 02:39:45.709
LOT THAT WE CAN FOR IN FORCE

02:39:45.776 --> 02:39:47.744
AGAINST- WHAT'S EMBARRASSING

02:39:47.811 --> 02:39:49.012
RATE IN THE- IN THE

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:50.380
REGULATIONS. WHAT'S THE

02:39:50.447 --> 02:39:52.115
PROPOSED RATE MINIMUM RATE OF

02:39:52.182 --> 02:39:53.817
COMPLIANCE HE PERCENT SENATE

02:39:53.884 --> 02:39:55.986
IT'S 0% MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE LET

02:39:56.053 --> 02:39:57.821
ME RESPOND TO LITERATURE WHICH

02:39:57.888 --> 02:39:58.789
SHOULD ALWAYS BE A HUNDRED

02:39:58.855 --> 02:40:01.725
PERCENT- AGAIN THE TIME WE HAVE

02:40:01.792 --> 02:40:02.793
TO SERVICE A POINT IN TIME

02:40:02.859 --> 02:40:03.894
SURVEY THAT IS MEASURING THE

02:40:03.961 --> 02:40:06.096
AVAILABILITY OF A SAMPLE OF

02:40:06.163 --> 02:40:06.997
PROVIDERS AT THAT POINT IN

02:40:07.064 --> 02:40:09.433
TIME- AT. ANY GIVEN POINT IN

02:40:09.499 --> 02:40:12.002
TIME- THAT WE MAY HAVE

02:40:12.069 --> 02:40:14.171
PROVIDERS THAT- ARE ON VACATION

02:40:14.237 --> 02:40:17.140
AND- FOR OTHER REASONS. OUT

02:40:17.207 --> 02:40:19.176
ALSO YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET

02:40:19.242 --> 02:40:20.510
AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE EXACT

02:40:20.577 --> 02:40:21.945
PROVIDER THAT YOU WANT AT ANY

02:40:22.012 --> 02:40:24.114
GIVEN POINT IN TIME- THE

02:40:24.181 --> 02:40:25.449
NETWORK NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO

02:40:25.515 --> 02:40:26.917
SUPPORT A TIMELY ACCESS

02:40:26.984 --> 02:40:28.952
APPOINTMENTS AND SO WE'RE YOU

02:40:29.019 --> 02:40:29.987
KNOW WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

02:40:30.053 --> 02:40:31.388
ASSESS THE CAPACITY OF THE

02:40:31.455 --> 02:40:33.657
NETWORK TO MEET. THE TIMELY

02:40:33.724 --> 02:40:35.225
ACCESS STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE

02:40:35.292 --> 02:40:37.794
UP IN THE LAW- AGAIN THAT 70%

02:40:37.861 --> 02:40:40.330
COMPLIANCE RATE WILL BE ALLOW

02:40:40.397 --> 02:40:42.899
US TO MEASURE THE ABILITY OF

02:40:42.966 --> 02:40:44.001
THE NETWORK TO MEET THOSE

02:40:44.067 --> 02:40:46.269
STANDARDS- WE WILL ALSO THEN BE

02:40:46.336 --> 02:40:48.405
ABLE TO TAKE. CORRECTIVE ACTION

02:40:48.472 --> 02:40:49.806
ENFORCEMENT AGAINST THAT TIMELY

02:40:49.873 --> 02:40:51.608
ACCESS COMPLIANCE STANDARDS. I

02:40:51.675 --> 02:40:52.709
WILL ALSO JUST MENTION THE

02:40:52.776 --> 02:40:54.211
TIMELY ACCESS IS JUST ONE

02:40:54.277 --> 02:40:55.879
COMPONENT OF HOW WE MET

02:40:55.946 --> 02:40:58.915
MEASURE- CONSUMER ACCESS TO

02:40:58.982 --> 02:41:00.484
CARE- WE ALSO OBVIOUSLY HAVE

02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:01.685
OUR HELP CENTER MONITOR

02:41:01.752 --> 02:41:03.420
COMPLAINTS WE ALSO MONITOR. ON

02:41:03.487 --> 02:41:04.888
THE NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS

02:41:04.955 --> 02:41:07.391
AGAINST THE GEOGRAPHIC- AND

02:41:07.457 --> 02:41:09.593
PROVIDER RATIOS AS WELL SO IT'S

02:41:09.659 --> 02:41:11.094
ONE COMPONENT BUT WE WILL BE

02:41:11.161 --> 02:41:13.196
TAKING A HOLISTIC REVIEW. TO

02:41:13.263 --> 02:41:16.233
THE- ACCESS ADEQUACY OF. OKAY

02:41:16.299 --> 02:41:19.069
SO I A- I APPRECIATE THE WORD

02:41:19.136 --> 02:41:21.238
HOLISTIC REVIEW BUT- IN SOME

02:41:21.304 --> 02:41:22.305
WAYS THE TIMELY ACCESS

02:41:22.372 --> 02:41:24.007
STANDARDS ARE WHERE THE RUBBER

02:41:24.074 --> 02:41:26.476
MEETS THE ROLE ROAD- I THINK

02:41:26.543 --> 02:41:27.978
IT'S- FOR US HERE IN THE

02:41:28.045 --> 02:41:30.313
LEGISLATURE AS WE PASS LAWS AND

02:41:30.380 --> 02:41:31.181
WHEN THE TIMELY ACCESS

02:41:31.248 --> 02:41:32.682
STANDARDS LAWS ARE PASSED I'M

02:41:32.749 --> 02:41:41.224
NOT SURE OF THE AUTHORS. OF

02:41:41.291 --> 02:41:42.292
THOUGHT THAT. THIS THE IN I

02:41:42.359 --> 02:41:43.093
THOUGHT THE STATE STANDARDS

02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:43.727
WERE SET PERCENT I MEAN I WHAT

02:41:43.794 --> 02:41:44.361
YOU'RE- AND I KNOW PACKED

02:41:44.428 --> 02:41:46.029
ISSUES. THAT FOR TO CHEAT A

02:41:46.096 --> 02:41:47.264
HUNDRED PER IS MAY NOT. TOTALLY

02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:47.864
REALIST BUT I GUESS THE

02:41:47.931 --> 02:41:49.066
QUESTION I HAVE THE IS THAT.

02:41:49.132 --> 02:41:50.901
OKAY YOU SAID THAT SANDERS THAT

02:41:50.967 --> 02:41:52.936
WE PUT INTO LAW THAT YOU'RE NOW

02:41:53.003 --> 02:41:54.438
IMPLEMENTING TO REGULATION YOU

02:41:54.504 --> 02:41:56.840
ONLY HAVE TO HIT IT 70% IS

02:41:56.907 --> 02:41:58.675
THERE SOME MINIMUM STANDARD.

02:41:58.742 --> 02:42:00.110
LIKE SO WHAT'S THE TAIL OF THAT

02:42:00.177 --> 02:42:01.878
SO YOU KNOW WE GOT- WHAT'S A

02:42:01.945 --> 02:42:04.314
TALE OF THAT CURVE- THAT SAYS

02:42:04.381 --> 02:42:05.315
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THIS PLAN

02:42:05.382 --> 02:42:07.717
REALLY IS- ELSE OKAY THEY GOT

02:42:07.784 --> 02:42:08.785
70% BUT YOU HAVE A CERTAIN

02:42:08.852 --> 02:42:11.488
PORTION. OF THAT 30% THAT'S

02:42:11.555 --> 02:42:12.456
REALLY DRAGGING OUT OR

02:42:12.522 --> 02:42:14.791
SOMETHING. IS AND AGAIN I KNOW

02:42:14.858 --> 02:42:16.526
YOU SAID HOLISTIC SO MAYBE LOOK

02:42:16.593 --> 02:42:18.328
SOME OTHER FACTORS BUT- I

02:42:18.395 --> 02:42:23.433
GUESS- I JUST. WANTED ONE BE

02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:24.334
CAREFUL THAT- WHAT. SHOULD

02:42:24.401 --> 02:42:26.269
PEOPLE REALLY EXPECT AND IS

02:42:26.336 --> 02:42:28.738
THAT REALLY GOOD ENOUGH. AND SO

02:42:28.805 --> 02:42:29.739
YOU KNOW WHEN WE PASS A LAW

02:42:29.806 --> 02:42:32.175
HERE- AND I DON'T I'M NOT SURE

02:42:32.242 --> 02:42:33.877
THE AUTHORS ARE THINKING LIKE-

02:42:33.944 --> 02:42:35.145
WHAT IS THE STANDARD 470% OF

02:42:35.212 --> 02:42:36.780
PEOPLE. AND I GET THE PRACTICAL

02:42:36.847 --> 02:42:38.748
REALITIES OF THIS SO I IT

02:42:38.815 --> 02:42:40.183
INTERESTING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:41.618
BUT I JUST WANNA BE REALLY.

02:42:41.685 --> 02:42:44.020
CAUTIOUS WITH THAT WHEN WE SAY

02:42:44.087 --> 02:42:46.056
70% AND ALSO EXACTLY HOW DOES A

02:42:46.123 --> 02:42:47.157
SKILL OR THE PARTICULAR

02:42:47.224 --> 02:42:48.425
SPECIALTIES OR SOMETHING

02:42:48.492 --> 02:42:48.925
BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE

02:42:48.992 --> 02:42:50.026
SOMEWHERE MAYBE A LITTLE

02:42:50.093 --> 02:42:51.528
CHALLENGING TO GET BUT THEN.

02:42:51.595 --> 02:42:54.364
STRATEGICALLY ALLOWS. A PLAN

02:42:54.431 --> 02:42:55.665
NOT TO CONTRACT AS WELL FOR

02:42:55.732 --> 02:42:56.700
CERTAIN MORE EXPENSIVE

02:42:56.766 --> 02:42:58.101
SPECIALTIES OR OTHER TYPES OF

02:42:58.168 --> 02:42:59.636
THINGS THAT. MAY BE MORE

02:42:59.703 --> 02:43:01.605
CHALLENGING. AND THAT'S WHERE

02:43:01.671 --> 02:43:02.906
THEY'RE SKEWING SO I THINK WE

02:43:02.973 --> 02:43:03.974
NEED TO. SO CERTAINLY THE

02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:05.275
OVERALL PERCENTAGE IS IMPORTANT

02:43:05.342 --> 02:43:06.443
BUT ALSO LOOKING AT A

02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:08.445
PARTICULAR AREAS WHERE ACCESS

02:43:08.512 --> 02:43:11.948
IS. A PERHAPS LESSENED- IN THAT

02:43:12.015 --> 02:43:13.850
30% THAT'S BEING DELAYED THAT

02:43:13.917 --> 02:43:17.954
MAY BE MORE CONCERNING. THAN

02:43:18.021 --> 02:43:18.455
WHEN WE LUMP EVERYTHING

02:43:18.522 --> 02:43:20.190
TOGETHER. RESP THAT REALLY

02:43:20.257 --> 02:43:21.892
QUICKLY I THINK WOULD WORSEN

02:43:21.958 --> 02:43:23.560
THE RATE OF COMPLIANCE AND 70%

02:43:23.627 --> 02:43:25.162
WHAT WE'RE SAYING THAT IS THAT

02:43:25.228 --> 02:43:27.097
AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME WHEN

02:43:27.164 --> 02:43:28.632
WE MAKE THESE CALLS TO ASSESS

02:43:28.698 --> 02:43:30.934
THE AVAILABILITY OF AN- THAT

02:43:31.001 --> 02:43:32.869
SEVENTY. PERCENT COMPLIANCE

02:43:32.936 --> 02:43:34.571
INDICATE THAT IN MOST CASES OF

02:43:34.638 --> 02:43:36.373
A CONSUMER CALL THEY WOULD BE

02:43:36.439 --> 02:43:38.441
ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT.

02:43:38.508 --> 02:43:39.209
WITHIN THE TIMELY ACCESS

02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:42.546
STANDARDS. IT'S NOT SAYING 30%

02:43:42.612 --> 02:43:43.747
OF THE NETWORK NUMBER HAS AN

02:43:43.813 --> 02:43:44.781
APPOINTMENT AND TIMELY ACCESS

02:43:44.848 --> 02:43:46.917
STANDARDS AND AGAIN. CONSUMERS

02:43:46.983 --> 02:43:48.618
HAVE A RIGHT TO GET A TIMELY

02:43:48.685 --> 02:43:49.819
APPOINTMENT WITHIN TIMELY

02:43:49.886 --> 02:43:51.655
ACCESS STANDARDS EVERY SINGLE

02:43:51.721 --> 02:43:54.124
TIME AND IF THEY CAN'T- THE

02:43:54.191 --> 02:43:55.725
HEALTH PLAN IS OBLIGATED TO

02:43:55.792 --> 02:43:56.760
ALLOW THEM TO GO OUT OF NETWORK

02:43:56.826 --> 02:43:58.228
AT THE END NETWORK KASHIRI RATE

02:43:58.295 --> 02:44:00.397
SO I THINK. WE STILL HAVE THAT

02:44:00.463 --> 02:44:03.733
CONSUMER PROTECTION. THE 70% OF

02:44:03.800 --> 02:44:06.002
THE WAY TO WAS SAYS YEAH. IF

02:44:06.069 --> 02:44:08.138
THE- THE ABILITY OF THE NETWORK

02:44:08.205 --> 02:44:09.639
TO SUPPORT THE TIMELY ACCESS

02:44:09.706 --> 02:44:11.041
REQUIREMENTS IT MAY MEAN THAT

02:44:11.107 --> 02:44:12.108
IF YOU CALL THAT INDIVIDUAL

02:44:12.175 --> 02:44:14.044
PROVIDER IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN

02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:15.645
APPOINTMENT YOU COULD CALL. IT

02:44:15.712 --> 02:44:16.913
A ONE OR TWO OTHER PROVIDERS

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:18.281
WITHIN THE NETWORK AND BE ABLE

02:44:18.348 --> 02:44:20.417
TO GET IN A TIMELY. WELL THAT

02:44:20.483 --> 02:44:22.352
OKAY FAA APPRECIATES THAT- I

02:44:22.419 --> 02:44:23.920
THINK ULTIMATELY. IT'S GOING TO

02:44:23.987 --> 02:44:25.188
COME DOWN TO THIS YEAR A

02:44:25.255 --> 02:44:27.190
REGULATORY AGENCY IS HOW YOU GO

02:44:27.257 --> 02:44:29.159
ABOUT ENFORCING AND AS YOU'RE

02:44:29.226 --> 02:44:31.061
LOOKING AT THESE THIS DATA AND

02:44:31.127 --> 02:44:32.462
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THAT DATA

02:44:32.529 --> 02:44:34.698
IS VASTLY IMPROVED NOW. THAT

02:44:34.764 --> 02:44:36.299
YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT

02:44:36.366 --> 02:44:38.768
ENFORCING IN A WAY THAT SENDS A

03:04:14.410 --> 03:04:17.379
DOLLARS. AND EVEN THAT STORY IS

03:04:17.446 --> 03:04:19.214
VERY LIMITED BECAUSE OF. VERY

03:04:19.281 --> 03:04:20.916
SIGNIFICANT DATA CHALLENGES.

03:04:20.983 --> 03:04:22.151
BUT IN MANY CASES THE STATE

03:04:22.217 --> 03:04:24.119
ACTUALLY HAS THE DATA. BUT WHAT

03:04:24.186 --> 03:04:25.354
WE HAVEN'T DONE IS PUT IN PLACE

03:04:25.421 --> 03:04:26.989
THE SYSTEMS AND STRATEGIES TO

03:04:27.055 --> 03:04:28.824
USE THE DATA SO I MENTIONED.

03:04:28.891 --> 03:04:30.692
WAYS TO LINK MENTAL HEALTH DATA

03:04:30.759 --> 03:04:32.594
AND EDUCATION DATA. OUR TEAM

03:04:32.661 --> 03:04:34.563
HAS DONE AN EFFECTIVE JOB OF

03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:35.998
LINKING MENTAL HEALTH DATA IN

03:04:36.064 --> 03:04:37.232
CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA AND CAN

03:04:37.299 --> 03:04:39.668
DEMONSTRATE IN SOME INSTANCES.

03:04:39.735 --> 03:04:40.502
IF THE RIGHT KIND OF MENTAL

03:04:40.569 --> 03:04:41.970
HEALTH SERVICES CAN HAVE AS

03:04:42.037 --> 03:04:43.772
MUCH AS A SIXTY NINE PERCENT.

03:04:43.839 --> 03:04:45.207
REDUCTION IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE

03:04:45.274 --> 03:04:46.375
INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE WE DELIVER

03:04:46.442 --> 03:04:47.876
CARE IN A TIMELY AND

03:04:47.943 --> 03:04:49.478
APPROPRIATE FASHION. SO OUR

03:04:57.319 --> 03:05:01.323
AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES. AND

03:05:01.390 --> 03:05:01.924
MOSTLY FOCUSED ON IMAGES SAY.

03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:03.225
OKAY SO YOU'RE INTERACTION WITH

03:05:03.292 --> 03:05:04.059

WITH THEM VERTICALLY THROUGH

03:05:21.944 --> 03:05:22.811

THIS FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH IN

03:05:26.915 --> 03:05:28.784
THE WORKPLACE WE RECOGNIZE THAT

03:05:28.851 --> 03:05:30.719
EMPLOYERS TO KEEP PARTNERS IN

03:05:30.786 --> 03:05:32.621
ENSURING ACCESS TO CARE AND

03:05:32.688 --> 03:05:33.856
THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO MEET

03:05:33.922 --> 03:05:35.190
THESE BROAD STATEWIDE GOALS OF

03:05:35.257 --> 03:05:36.191
ENSURING THAT EVERYBODY HAS

03:05:36.258 --> 03:05:37.860
ACCESS TO CARE YOU CAN'T SIMPLY

03:05:37.926 --> 03:05:39.194

OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE IS A IS A

03:05:42.564 --> 03:05:44.466
KEY PARTNER WE'RE STILL

03:05:44.533 --> 03:05:45.801
LEARNING ABOUT EACH OTHER'S

03:05:45.868 --> 03:05:47.469
WORK WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN

03:05:47.536 --> 03:05:49.171
THE PARITY LEGISLATION HOW

03:05:49.238 --> 03:05:50.939
THAT'S IMPLEMENTED. AND WE'RE

03:05:51.006 --> 03:05:52.274
ALSO TALKING FOR EXAMPLE WITH

03:05:52.341 --> 03:05:54.877
CALPERS AS A LARGE PURCHASER OF

03:05:54.943 --> 03:05:56.745
HEALTH CARE ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH

03:05:56.812 --> 03:05:58.080
WE CAN LEVERAGE THE STATE'S

03:05:58.146 --> 03:05:59.948
PURCHASING POWER OR THE

03:06:00.015 --> 03:06:00.682
PURCHASING POWER OF THE PUBLIC

03:06:00.749 --> 03:06:02.518
SECTOR. REALLY SHAPE THE WAY

03:06:02.584 --> 03:06:04.786
THE MARKET IS DESIGNED AROUND

03:06:04.853 --> 03:06:09.458
CREATING AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE.

03:06:09.525 --> 03:06:10.092
AND APPROPRIATE CARE ACROSS THE

03:06:10.158 --> 03:06:12.027
STATE. SO IF IT JUST AND AGAIN

03:06:12.094 --> 03:06:13.495
I AM NEW AT THIS I DON'T HAVE

03:06:13.562 --> 03:06:16.164
THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF-

03:06:16.231 --> 03:06:19.368
OF DOCTOR PAN BUT- IN IN

03:06:19.434 --> 03:06:20.702
ESSENCE YOU SERVE AS THE

03:06:20.769 --> 03:06:21.904
DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED

03:06:21.970 --> 03:06:26.441
HEALTHCARE FOR. PROP SIXTY

03:06:26.508 --> 03:06:27.843
THREE NINE. WELL THEY SAW THAT

03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:29.244
THE ORIGINS OF THE COMMISSION

03:06:29.311 --> 03:06:32.214
ARE ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE

03:06:32.281 --> 03:06:35.017
FIRST THATTHE MSA REVENUES

03:06:35.083 --> 03:06:38.186
THAT ARE GENERATED- YOU TO

03:06:38.253 --> 03:06:39.588
CREATE THAT PUBLIC TRUST THAT

03:06:39.655 --> 03:06:41.123
ACCOUNTABILITY IN PUBLIC TRUST

03:06:41.189 --> 03:06:43.058
THESE DOLLARS ARE WELL SPENT I

03:06:43.125 --> 03:06:44.493
WOULD SAY MORE BROADLY IT'S

03:06:44.560 --> 03:06:46.728
ALSO TO CREATE THE POLITICAL

03:06:46.795 --> 03:06:47.763
CAPITAL THE PUBLIC

03:06:47.829 --> 03:06:48.964
UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT THAT

03:06:49.031 --> 03:06:50.098
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:06:50.165 --> 03:06:51.199
EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS CARE GETS

03:06:51.266 --> 03:06:54.603
CARE. IT'S SO. MET QUITE OFTEN

03:06:54.670 --> 03:06:55.771
THE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THE

03:06:55.837 --> 03:06:57.005
COMMISSION REALLY OVERSEAS

03:06:57.072 --> 03:06:59.174
DAMAGES A DOLLARS BUT THE LAW

03:06:59.241 --> 03:07:00.175
IS VERY CLEAR THAT THE

03:07:00.242 --> 03:07:00.976
COMMISSION IS AN OVERSIGHT

03:07:01.043 --> 03:07:02.778
AGENCY OVER THE OUR SYSTEMS OF

03:07:02.844 --> 03:07:04.112
CARE CHILDREN'S SYSTEM OF CARE

03:07:04.179 --> 03:07:05.280
ADULT SYSTEM IF YOU'RE AN OLDER

03:07:05.347 --> 03:07:07.316
ADULT SYSTEM A CARE BUT THAT

03:07:07.382 --> 03:07:08.850
THE COMMITTEE BUT BECAUSE OF

03:07:08.917 --> 03:07:11.019
THE LANGUAGE OF PREVENTION. IN

03:07:11.086 --> 03:07:13.221
THE ACT WHICH IS VERY EXPLICIT

03:07:13.288 --> 03:07:14.389
BUT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT

03:07:14.456 --> 03:07:15.824
RESPONDING TO PEOPLE AFTER THEY

03:07:15.891 --> 03:07:17.960
HAVE NEEDS IT'S REALLY ABOUT

03:07:18.026 --> 03:07:19.595
THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN

03:07:19.661 --> 03:07:24.733
ACTUALLY PREVENT THE ONSET OF

03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:25.968
OR THE ESCALATION OF. FOR

03:07:26.034 --> 03:07:27.069
SYSTEM L. L. AND BECAUSE OF

03:07:27.135 --> 03:07:28.904
THAT PREVENTION LANGUAGE WE

03:07:28.971 --> 03:07:30.072
REALLY SEE THAT AS A WAY IN

03:07:30.138 --> 03:07:31.473
WHICH WE NEED TO APPROACH THESE

03:07:31.540 --> 03:07:32.374
CHALLENGES TO A PUBLIC HEALTH

03:07:32.441 --> 03:07:34.343
MODEL. OF REALLY THINKING ABOUT

03:07:34.409 --> 03:07:36.578
POPULATION BASED STRATEGIES SO

03:07:36.645 --> 03:07:39.114
IT'S VERY BROAD- OUR PRIMARY

03:07:39.181 --> 03:07:40.916
ROLE ACTUALLY IS ADVISORY TO

03:07:40.983 --> 03:07:41.550
THE GOVERNOR AND THE

03:07:41.617 --> 03:07:43.318
LEGISLATURE ALTHOUGH IN RECENT

03:07:43.385 --> 03:07:44.453
YEARS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

03:07:44.519 --> 03:07:45.520
GOVERNOR HAVE GIVEN THE

03:07:45.587 --> 03:07:47.022
COMMISSION MORE IMPLEMENTATION

03:07:47.089 --> 03:07:49.157
OF THE ALREADY. AROUND THINGS

03:07:49.224 --> 03:07:51.426
LIKE LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS.

03:07:51.493 --> 03:07:52.361
WE ISSUE REGULATIONS FOR

03:07:52.427 --> 03:07:54.563
PREVENTION AND INNOVATION OUR

03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:55.831
WORK TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

03:07:55.897 --> 03:07:57.733
PREVENTION CAN MEAN AND SHOULD

03:07:57.799 --> 03:07:59.267
MEAN IN THE MIDDLE HOLE SPACE

03:07:59.334 --> 03:08:00.268
REALLY COMES OUT OF SOME

03:08:00.335 --> 03:08:01.403
LEGISLATION FROM A COUPLE OF

03:08:01.470 --> 03:08:02.938
YEARS AGO. THAT ASK THIS

03:08:03.005 --> 03:08:04.373
QUESTION OF HOW CAN WE BETTER

03:08:04.439 --> 03:08:05.574
UNDERSTAND OUR PREVENTION

03:08:05.641 --> 03:08:07.476
EFFORTS ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE

03:08:07.542 --> 03:08:08.377
IN PART OF THAT IS REALLY

03:08:08.443 --> 03:08:10.145
TRYING TO START WITH WHAT WE

03:08:10.212 --> 03:08:11.146
ACTUALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

03:08:11.213 --> 03:08:12.814
WITH PREVENTION. AND WE DON'T

03:08:12.881 --> 03:08:13.915
HAVE BROAD BASED AGREEMENT ON

03:08:13.982 --> 03:08:15.951
THAT AT THE MOMENT NOT JUST NOT

03:08:16.018 --> 03:08:17.552
JUST IN CALIFORNIABUT IT BUT

03:08:17.619 --> 03:08:18.787
YOU KNOW CROSS THE COUNTRY

03:08:18.854 --> 03:08:20.989
THAT'S AN AREA WHERE- WE REALLY

03:08:21.056 --> 03:08:22.858
HAVE TO. BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT

03:08:22.924 --> 03:08:24.459
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES LOOK LIKE

03:08:24.526 --> 03:08:27.629
THAT WE CAN SHAPE HOW

03:08:27.696 --> 03:08:29.331
CALIFORNIA CAN PURSUE THEM. AND

03:08:29.398 --> 03:08:32.134
IF YOU'RE AN ADVISORY BUT IN

03:08:32.200 --> 03:08:34.236
SOME RESPECTS OF A REGULATORY

03:08:34.302 --> 03:08:35.570
WITHOUT ANY KIND OF REGULATORY

03:08:35.637 --> 03:08:37.472
POWER CORRECT IF I'M WE

REGULATIONS FOR P. E. I. N. FOR

03:08:39.941 --> 03:08:41.677
INNOVATION AND THE ENFORCEMENT

03:08:41.743 --> 03:08:43.245
MECHANISM IS SUCH THAT IF WE

03:08:43.311 --> 03:08:45.213
IDENTIFY A CHALLENGE WE ARE

03:08:45.280 --> 03:08:46.782
DIRECTED TO REPORT THAT REPORT

03:08:46.848 --> 03:08:47.816

A TOUCH ON TALK ABOUT

03:09:06.234 --> 03:09:09.337
HISTORICAL IS THAT- AND AGAIN

03:09:09.404 --> 03:09:10.205
REALLY APPRECIATE THE

03:09:10.272 --> 03:09:11.506
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AT THE

03:09:11.573 --> 03:09:12.641
INTEREST IN HEARING MORE ABOUT

03:09:12.708 --> 03:09:14.076

03:09:22.784 --> 03:09:23.885
THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE

03:09:23.952 --> 03:09:25.954
HAD WITH AN HSA FUNDING BEFORE

03:09:26.021 --> 03:09:27.823

THE MONEY IN FACT- SEVERAL

03:09:30.625 --> 03:09:32.160
YEARS AGO WE FOUND OUT THAT- WE

03:09:32.227 --> 03:09:33.862
DON'T EVEN COLLECT DATA ON HOW.

03:09:33.929 --> 03:09:34.963
QUICKLY TO MOVING THE MONEY

SPENDING THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE

03:09:48.310 --> 03:09:51.179
GETTING IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND

03:09:51.246 --> 03:09:51.747

PERSPECTIVE I THINK WE HAVE

03:10:06.161 --> 03:10:09.731
COME A LONG WAY- BUT YOU KNOW

03:10:09.798 --> 03:10:11.299
BASED ON THE COMMENTS THAT YOU

03:10:11.366 --> 03:10:12.734
AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAVE

03:10:12.801 --> 03:10:14.336
RAISED IN THE PAST WE HAVE SOME

03:10:14.402 --> 03:10:16.071
SIGNIFICANT WAYS TO GO. OKAY

03:10:16.138 --> 03:10:20.175
YEAH. IN THE IN A RECENT BSA

03:10:20.242 --> 03:10:21.376
AUDIT I THINK IT WAS ISSUED IN

03:10:21.443 --> 03:10:23.378
OCTOBER THE AUDITOR RAISED SOME

03:10:23.445 --> 03:10:25.580
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE

03:10:25.647 --> 03:10:29.050
ADEQUACY OF RECORDING- IT

03:10:29.117 --> 03:10:30.318
REALLY REPORTING OVER THE

03:10:30.385 --> 03:10:31.787
BROADER SYSTEM SO NOT JUST THE

03:10:31.853 --> 03:10:33.088
MHSAA BUT THE OTHER REVENUE

STREAMS THAT ARE USED TO

03:10:34.523 --> 03:10:35.891
SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

03:10:35.957 --> 03:10:37.025
IN CALIFORNIA ON THE PUBLIC

03:10:37.092 --> 03:10:39.494
SIDE IMAGES SAYS ABOUT 25% OF

03:10:39.561 --> 03:10:41.296
THOSE DOLLARS I'M I DO THINK

03:10:41.363 --> 03:10:43.899
THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN A STRONGER

THE STATE AT OUR OWN RISK TO

03:22:43.117 --> 03:22:45.286
