GOOD MORNING CAROL JOHN COMMITTEE MY NAME IS VERONICA AND I AM THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PAYMENT COUNTY SELBACH I AM TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE TOP ADMINISTRATORS OF CALIFORNIA AS A CO SPONSOR EIGHTY NINE SIX SEVEN. I THOUGHT THIRTY MINUTES LATER WE ARE OBLIGATED TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES ARE GIVEN THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAMS. YOU TO THE COMING NINETEEN PANDEMIC CALLED WORKFORCE TO CLOSE THEIR PHYSICAL SECURITY COMPLY WITH PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS. CONTRA MANTA INSTRUCTION IN THE LINE OF MOST OF OUR STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH DISABILITIES IN MANY CASES I'M NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SERVICE CENTRE DISTANCE LEARNING DESPITE THE INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY OF EDUCATORS BUT THE BLOOD INCREASE. BETWEEN BIRTH AND FAMILY SCHOOL FIND SOMETHING TO FIND WORK CURRENT FUNDING CANNOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THAT NEED. MORE STUDENTS GO BACK IN PERSON LEARNING WE WANT TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION TO ENSURE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED WE WANT TO UPLIFT PROACTIVE MEASURES WHICH PRESERVATION CHEN AND PROMOTE EQUITABLE SOLUTION WELL NOT INFRINGING ON THE ABILITY FOR FAMILY TO PROCEED TO THE CATHEDRAL RIGHT AND SAFEGUARDS.

THE BILL WOULD BE WHAT THE CROP CALIFORNIA BEEN DOING FOR YEARS WORKING WITH FAMILIES TO ENSURE THEIR RIGHT TO REALIZE ADDRESSING THE IMPACT IT DIDN'T WELLNESS AND LEARNING SHOULD BE THOUGHTFULLY DONE THROUGH AN EMPATHETIC ONE WITH AN INCENTIVE TO PRESERVE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FAMILIES AND ALII. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAD MORE TIMES THE NATIONAL RATE SPECIAL EDUCATION LEGAL FILINGS WHICH ARE COSTLY IN DOLLARS AND EVEN MORE SO THE TAX IN THE RELATIONSHIP THE BILL AND GROUNDBREAKING AT THAT INSPIRES US TO RETHINK THAT SYSTEM OUR INTENT IS THAT THE MAXIMUM AND OF DOLLARS GO TO SERVICE THREE.

SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY ONE TO ONE BEHAVIOURAL AS AN ESPECIALLY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTION MOST STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR EDUCATION. MANY SERVICES ACTIVITIES CRITICAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS ARE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO DELIVER ON MINE. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR CLIENTS WITH AUTISM HAS BEEN TOTALLY UNABLE TO ACCESS THE ONLINE EDUCATION FOR THE PAST YEAR. WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF HIS ONE TO ONE AIDE WHICH IS REQUIRED BY HIS INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM. ANOTHER CLIENT LOOKS TERRIBLE PAUL BECAUSE BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE GAMES WITH HER WALKING AND HAND WRITING SKILLS. WITHOUT ACCESS TO HER IN PERSON OCCUPATIONAL AND PHYSICAL THERAPY.

AT SCHOOLS REOPEN WE ANTICIPATE A FLOOD OF REQUEST FOR ASSESSMENT OF TWELVE FIFTY THREE FAMILIES IN COLD EVER SERVICE OF THE RESOURCES THAT WERE REQUIRED BY THE CHILD'S I EP.

AND THIS IS BY MISTER GIBSON. YOU MAY PERCEIVE ALREADY. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL OF FIVE TWENTY WHICH- WOOD ECSTATIC THE CALIFORNIA DIVERSIFYING THE TEACHER WORKFORCE GRANT PROGRAM. THIS BILL SEEKS TO SUPPORT LOCAL PROGRAMS AIMED TO BUILT TO BUILDING A MORE DIVERSE TEACHER WORKFORCE THAT'S MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY MEN OF COLOR PRISON REPRESENTS LESS THAN 10% OF CALIFORNIANS TEACHING WORKFORCE. OF THAT 10% BLACK AND LATINO MEN MAKES UP JUST 122% OF THE WORKFORCE. STUDENTS OF COLOR MAKES UP ABOUT 75% OF CALIFORNIA'S STUDENT POPULATIONS. THESE ARE STARK DIFFERENCES. THAT RESEARCH IDENTIFY THE DEMOGRAPHIC MISMATCH WHICH LOW ACHIEVEMENT OF FROM STUDENTS OF COLOR EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THIS DEMOGRAPHIC MIX MAC CAN DRIVE INEQUALITY IN ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. ARE STUDIES FOUND BLACKS AND WHITES CHILDREN ALIKE ARE SET TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CHEEVER HIGHER CHEAPER- WHEN ASSIGNED TO TEACHING. OF THEIR OWN RACE. BUT BECAUSE WHITE STUDENTS ARM FAR MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THE SAME RACE TEACHERS DISPROPORTIONATE BENEFITS MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT TEACHERS OF COLOR PRODUCE MORE FAVORABLE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES IN THE SHORT RUN FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR IN TERMS OF STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES ATTENDANCE COURSE PERFORMANCE AND SUSPENSION IN BI DISTRICT COPYRIGHT VICE GOODNESS BECAUSE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN A PILOT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE RETENTION RATES. OF MALE TEACHERS OF COLOR WHO HAVE SOME OF THE LOWER RETENTION RATES THE GOAL WITH THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE MORE TOOLS FROM THE STATE LEVEL TO BUILD AN INNOVATIVE IDEAL ALIKE. IT'S ABOUT STUDENTS WHEN STUDENTS CAN IDENTIFY. THEIR TEACHER CAN IDENTIFY WITH THEIR TEACHER AND SEE THEM AS ROLE MODELS THERE ARE USUALLY THERE ARE ULTIMATELY MORE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. THEY SHOWED GREAT CONFIDENCE AND PROPEL THEM TO PURSUE AND ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS. IT'S TRULY. IT'S TRULY ABOUT THE STUDENTS WE REGULARLY TALK ABOUT EQUITY. BUT IT IS CRITICAL TO STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF RESEARCH OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH REPORTS THAT A BLACK OF TEACHER FOR ONE YEAR IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL REYES WILL RAISE LONG% TERM EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT FOR BLACK MALE STUDENTS EXPRESSLY BUT THOSE FROM LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FOR THE MOST DIVERSE A DISADVANTAGE- BLACK MALES THE REPORT ESTIMATES THAT EXPOSED TO A BLACK TEACHER IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL REDUCE- HIGH SCHOOL DROP OUT RATE BY 39% AND REYES. COLLEGE ONGOING ASPIRATIONS AB FIVE TWENTY WOULD PROVIDE SCHOOLS WITH TOOLS TO HELP THEM BUILD A MORE DIVERSE TEACH TEACHER POPULATION AND TO RETAIN THOSE WHO ARE HAPPY TO BE IN THIS PROFESSION AND CONTINUE TO BE ROLE MODELS FOR OUR STUDENTS AB FIVE TWENTY.

OUR SPONSOR A TO THIS BILL AND URGE THE SUPPORT OF THE MEMBERS. OF THIS COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW THEY'RE GREAT TEACHERS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS THERE'S CERTAINLY NO QUESTION OF THAT. BUT AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON POINTS OUT IN HIS OPENING REMARKS- DIVERSIFYING THE TEACHER WORKFORCE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. WHO EXPERIENCED THE TREATMENT GAP YEAH AND- AND SO IN THAT RESPECT WE'RE EXCITED TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL. AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A GRANT PROGRAM. THAT WOULD EXPAND THE PROGRAMS THAT DIVERSIFY THE TEACH WORK FORCE WITH AN EMPHASIS ON PROGRAMS LIKE MALE EDUCATORS. OF COLOR PIPELINE PROGRAMS. THESE PIPELINE PROGRAMS HAVE. REALLY GROWN ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING- IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE PROGRAMS AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE. WE HAVE A PROGRAM TO CAL STATE BAKERSFIELD- IN IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS DISTRICT ACCOUNT AND UNIFIED AT BERKELEY UNIFIED- IN MANY DISTRICTS- THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN. THAT DIVERSIFYING THE TEACHER PIPELINE IN HAVING. EDUCATORS OF COLOR- PROVIDES BENEFITS TO STUDENTS OF COLOR AND TO ALL STUDENTS OF FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS. I'D LOVE TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE RESEARCH. OF DR TRAVIS BRISTOL- FROM THE DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BERKELEY- I CANNOT BE HERE TODAY HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE PARTNER FOR US IN SHARING HIS RESEARCH ON HOW THE BAIL. EDUCATOR PIPELINE PROGRAMS CAN ADD TO THE MIX OF GREAT RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. FOR CLOSING LEARNING GAPS FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND FOR. ALL STUDENTS WE'VE HEARD. FROM OUR PARTNERS AT THE C. ISSUE. HIS MILITARY OF COLOR TYPE PRO. ARE ABLE TO OFFER ADDITIONAL SO. THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHETHER BE A RATHER PROGRAM OR COACHING- FOR OTHER TYPES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THAT WILL ALLOW OUR- EDUCATOR TO STAY IN THE WORKFORCE- RESEARCH IS SHOWING THAT MANY EDUCATORS EXPERIENCE ALL KINDS OF CHALLENGES AND IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO STAY IN THE WORKFORCE. BUT IN PARTICULAR- THAT MALE EDUCATORS OF COLOR- SHOULD HAVE SHORTER TIMES IN THE WORK FORCE BECAUSE OF MANY EXPERIENCES LIKE MICRO AGGRESSIONS AND LACK OF SUPPORT. THAT THEY EXPERIENCED SO FOR ALL THE BENEFITS THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF THIS GRANT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO OUR DISTRICT- TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND STRENGTHEN. EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY THE TEACHER WORKFORCE WITH THE NIGHT AND AN EMPHASIS ON SUPPORTING MALE EDUCATOR COLOR PIPELINE PROGRAMS- WE KNOW THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER THE CHEATING GAP HAS BEEN EXACERBATED. DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE GREAT RESOURCES AS WE CAN A CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE LEARNING NOW BUT ALSO TO CONTINUE OUR EYE TOWARDS THE FUTURE ON HELPING TO CLOSE OPPORTUNITY GAPS AND SUPPORT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS STUDENTS.

GOOD MORNING HAVE A ZERO DONALD AND KATIE MEMBERS AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE STAFF FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AS POLICYMAKERS WE CANNOT MANAGE WHAT WE CANNOT MEASURE OUR CURRENT EDUCATIONAL DATA SYSTEMS EXIST IN SILOS THEY DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER THEY HAVE INCONSISTENT DEFINITIONS THIS MEANS THAT POLICY MAKERS AND RESEARCHERS ARE UNABLE TO ANSWER BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT STUDENT PROGRESS AND OUTCOMES SUCH AS- AS HAVE RECENT REFORMS SUCH AS- I'LL SEE IF I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. AND WHAT EQUITY GAPS EXIST THAT KEY TRANSITION POINTS WITHIN THE EDUCATIONAL PIPELINE FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND THOSE FROM DISADVANTAGED SOCIAL ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS MY PREVIOUS WORK ON REMEDIAL EDUCATION AND THAT WAS SEVEN OH FIVE TO- CHANGE OUTCOMES AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WAS BASED ON EXACTLY THIS TYPE OF DATA DATA. OUR CURRENT DATA INFRASTRUCTURE IS MAINLY USED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REPORTING THIS BILL MARKS A MEANINGFUL SHIFT IN HOW WE USE THIS DATA IT WILL EMPOWER US MAKE BETTER AND MORE IMPACTFUL INVESTMENTS IN OUR FUTURE BASED ON MORE COMPLETE EVIDENCE. AB NINETY NINE WILL ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM WHICH WILL SECURELY CONNECT THE DATA THAT SCHOOLS COLLEGES FINANCIAL AID PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYEES ALREADY COLLECTED NEIGHBORING POLICYMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC. TO HAVE A COMPLETE PICTURE OF A STUDENT'S JOURNEY. OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WEST THAT HAS FACILITATED A ROBUST AND CROSS CUTTING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. RESULTING IN A MEANINGFUL BLUEPRINT OF HOW TO CONNECT OUR MAYES OF EXISTING SYSTEMS INTO ONE COHESIVE SYSTEM. AB NINETY NINE ENSURES THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL BE DESIGNED WITH PRIVACY. AND SECURITY OF THE STATE AS THE TOP PRIORITY AND PROVIDES THE LEGISLATURE WITH A VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY. TO DIG INTO POLICY DECISIONS THAT AFFECT SO MANY STAKEHOLDERS. I WANT TO THANK THE FACILITATORS OF THE WORKING GROUP ONE OF WHOM IS HERE TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE PLANNING PROCESS. AS PART OF THE WEST AND SEX A POST SECONDARY PATHWAYS AND CAREER MOBILITY TEAM CATHY BOOTH.

TO MEET WORKFORCE AND EQUITY GOALS. THANK THANK YOU MISTER INTO YOUR FIRST WITNESS. ON THE PHONE. AT THE CAPITOL FROM WEST THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLANNING PROCESS BOB WHAT WE STARTED OUT WE WERE ASKED TO ADDRESS SEVERAL DIFFERENT TOPICS HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT PRIVACY WOULD BE KEPT- PRIVATE HOW WE WOULD PUT TOGETHER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DID NOT REQUIRE NEW INVESTMENTS RATHER LEVERAGE THINGS THAT ALREADY EXISTED HOW TO MOVE BEYOND EDUCATION DATA TO A COULD WORK FORCE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES INFORMATION. I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA THAT WAS THERE WOULD HELP ADDRESS EQUITY GAPS AND HOW WE CAN ADVANCE POLICY RESEARCH OVER THE LAST SIXTEEN MONTHS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE HELPED DESIGN SYSTEM INCLUDING BOTH PEOPLE FROM THE VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES HAVE BOTH THE AUDIENCES AND ALMOST ALL THE DECISIONS THAT WERE. RECOMMENDED ARE UNANIMOUS. THE DIDN'T APPOINTMENT SEVERAL COME. ONE IS THAT IT WILL KICKED THE HIGH. IN TO CREATE ANALYTIC DATA FACT THAT THE PUBLIC CAN ACCESS THE DASHBOARD A QUERY BUILDER AND REQUEST PROCESS. THEY WILL ALSO BE TOLD THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT. POSSIBLE COLLEGES AND CAREERS FIGURE OUT IF YOU'RE TAKING THE RIGHT COURSES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE ELIGIBLE TO GO TO UC OR CSU. AND MAKING IT EASIER TO APPLY FOR BOTH COLLEGE AND FINANCIAL AID AND THAT'S BY SCALING EXISTING STATE PROGRAM CALL CALIFORNIA COLLEGES DOT EDU. IT ALSO WOULD REVAMPING EXISTING. ELECTRONIC TRANSCRIPTS PROGRAM CALLED THE TRANSCRIPT CALIFORNIA. TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SHARE INFORMATION LIKE BADGES FOR COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION AS WELL AS FIFTEEN TO CHECK THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR SOCIAL SERVICES. FINALLY THE SYSTEM WILL INCLUDE COMMUNITY OUTREACH TO ENSURE THAT MANY DIFFERENT POPULATIONS KNOW ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND CAN'T EFFECTIVELY USE AT. LEAST SOME OF THE THINGS SEPARATE BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY INTERRELATED THERE ARE WAYS THAT THE TOOLS TO HELP STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DATA. THAT ARE HELD BY THE STATE AGENCIES THAT'LL MAKE THE ANALYTICAL RESEARCH MARCH SECOND. THE PANDEMIC IS MADE CLEAR THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THE DATA SYSTEM. ON IT IS GROUNDED IN EFFECTIVE PRACTICES THE GENERAL EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT WHY IT'S GOING TO BE SEVEN USEFUL. BUT THIS IS A HIGHLY INCLUSIVE SYSTEM IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST INCLUSIVE FOR PUBLIC PERSPECTIVES IN THE GOVERNANCE PROCESS. HAS ALREADY BEEN- BY THE APPROVED. BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THANK YOU.

HI GOOD MORNING CARADON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME AND DR STUDENT JAZZ EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA COMPETE. WHERE POLICY RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION EQUITY IN THE ECONOMY. I'M HERE TO WIN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL NINETY NINE INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN WITH A FABLESS THE LONG OVERDUE CREDIT A CREATE A SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA IS JUST ONE OF TWO STATES WITHOUT SUCH A SYSTEM WHICH MEANS CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS LACK THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO FASTER STUDENTS WORKERS AND THE ECONOMY. CURRENTLY OUR STATE VARIOUS DATASETS WORKING PILOTS. K. TWELVE SEPARATE FROM HIGHER EDUCATION SEPARATE FROM WORKFORCE AND TELEVISED. HOWEVER THE CHALLENGE OF CALIFORNIANS SPACE ARE NOT VALID FROM EACH OTHER NOT ONLY ARE THESE CHALLENGES CONNECTED BUT THEY ALSO COMPOUND EACH OTHER. CALIFORNIANS WERE UNDERSERVED IN K. TWELVE WILL BENEFIT FAIRS AND ACCESSING COLLEGE AND THE WILL BE WORSE OFF AND FINDING A GOOD JOB. THE INDIVIDUAL SUFFERED AFTER THE STATE AS A WHOLE. WE SUPPORT AB NINETY NINE BECAUSE IT WAS A LITTLE BY THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CRADLE TO CAREER WORK GROUP. WHICH ENGAGE ALONG PARTICIPATORY PROCESS AND DEVELOPINGITS PLAN. MAKING THE ALREADY EXISTING DATASETS. ALLOWED TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO HAVE OPEN OPEN ACCESS TO USER FRIENDLY DASHBOARD. AND ALLOWS FOR TEACHERS COUNSELORS STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO THE THREAT OF OPERATIONAL TOOLS THAT SUPPORT THINGS LIKE COLLEGE AND CAREER PLANNING. LIST ALL THE POTENTIAL BECAUSE THE LACK OF COMPREHENSIVE LONGITUDINAL DATA PREVENT POLICYMAKERS FROM PINPOINTING WHERE CALIFORNIANS FATHER THE CRUX OF THE EDUCATION TO EMPLOYMENT PIPELINE. HOW THAT VARIES BY RACE GENDER REGION IN INCOME WHY IT HAPPENED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. LEADERSHIP IS THE BEDROCK OF ALL SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE BASED CHANGE FOR POLICY MAKERS THE PUBLIC AND STUDENTS. IT IS LONG OVERDUE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS CRITICAL. ISSUE AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU. I KNOW KNOW I'VE THEY'RE NOT. WITNESSES WITH THAT WILL IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. I COMMENTS RENDON THE CAN MEMBERS- MISTER. I JUST QUIT COM I WANT TO THANK YOU FRIENDLY IN THE BILL THIS IS ONE OF MANY AREAS WERE CALIFORNIA HAS LAGGED BEHIND- VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION AS YOU WITNESS THAT IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT'S LONG OVERDUE. THANK YOU HAVE A SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISS CLARK SILVA. YEAH CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN. WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE- WHETHER IT'S PARENT TEACHER. OR EVEN ADMINISTRATION. YEAH I KNOW YOU SAID A- COMPUTER DATA SYSTEM DASHBOARD BUT- WOULD IT BE. INDIVIDUALIZED FOR EACH STUDENT AND FROM SAY KINDERGARTEN TO. COLLEGE THEIR DATA IS BEING- ACCRUED INTO A SYSTEM SO THAT. THROUGHOUT THEIR EDUCATION YEARS THINKING GO ON AND- OTHERS CAN. I MEAN. RELATED TO PRIVACY. JUST KIND OF HOW IT IS. WITH THIS LOOK YOU KNOW I MEAN I HAVE- ONE OF THE- SPEAKERS ANSWER THAT QUESTION NOT. BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING AS A COMMITTEE ON WHAT THE MOST. APPROPRIATE WAY. TO IMPLEMENT THIS IT AND IT IS. VERY MUCH. CONCERNED WITH- BUT DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION. AND SO. DO WE HAVE ONE OF THE SPEAKERS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. WHETHER INDIVIDUALS CAN. HOW THEY WOULD BE TRACKING THEIR PROGRESS. ACTUALLY THIS IS KATHY WITH FROM SAID SO FOR THE TOOL BUT THE DASH. WHERE THEY POLICYMAKERS GO ON TO UNDERSTAND DIFFERENTIAL OUTCOMES AFTER THAT PANDEMIC HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE AN INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION YOU'D ONLY BE ABLE TO SEE GROUPS OF STUDENTS. BUT IF YOU'RE IN ONE OF THE TOOLS LIKE LET'S SAY YOU ARE A COUNSELOR AT A HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT A STUDENT HAS TAKEN THE RIGHT COURSES THAT THEY CAN APPLY. TO THE CSU OF THEIR CHOICE THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL LEVEL DATA JUST FOR THAT STUDENTS WHICH SAID LOOK AT ME THAT STUDENTS TO SAY OH THIS IS A CLASSIC NEED TO TAKE. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO APPLY SO THERE'S A LOT OF VERY CAREFUL SAFEGUARDS THE ONLY BE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL LEVEL DATA. AND ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF COUNSELING. OKAY AND THIS ONE FOLLOW UP SO THINGS THEIR TEN SCORES. ON A- BIG AS- THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION WOULD BE. PUT IN THEIR THROUGHOUT THEIR SCHOOLING IS. YEAH BUT IT BUT IT WOULD BE AS NOTED THAT I'LL GO AHEAD. YEAH SO FAR ON IT FOR THE PUBLIC DATASETS THERE WILL BE INFORMATION ABOUT BROAD THINGS LIKE TEST SCORES HOWEVER HE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE THAT FOR INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS- THE TOOLS THAT ARE FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER PLANNING DON'T I BELIEVE INCLUDE TEST SCORES THEY'RE MUCH MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE YOU'RE TAKING THE RIGHT COURSES AND YOU'VE- FINISHED EDITING THINGS LIKE YOUR FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEE YOU KNOW FOR THE CALMEST BENNETT.

THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING IN A CHAIR IN MEMBERS. ARE I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING TO COMMITTEE COMMITMENT I THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF. FOR ALL THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE ON THIS BILL. WITH MY OFFICE I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB FIVE NINE NINE WHICH ALIGNS THE WAY SCHOOLS ARE. ARE IDENTIFIED FOR INSPECTION BY COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. WITH THOSE IDENTIFIED UNDER CURRENT L. C. FF. ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AS WE START TO RETURN TO IN PERSON LEARNING. ENSURING OUR SCHOOLS ARE WELL EQUIPPED WITH ADEQUATE FACILITIES INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND MOST IMPORTANT. UP FULLY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS NEED TO BE ONE OF OUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES. FURTHER WE CAN SETTLEMENT THE CUT CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTIONALLY OBLIGATED TO ENSURE YOU THE RECEIVING THE BASIC TOOLS. THEY NEED TO RECEIVE A QUALITY EDUCATION. THE WILLIAMS CASE CREATES AN ANNUAL LIST OF POOR PERFORMING SCHOOLS REQUIRES THAT COUNTY OFFICES EVALUATE THEM FACILITY ADEQUATELY. MISALIGNED EDUCATORS AND QUALIFIED INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. OUTDATED. HAVE BEEN FROZEN IN PLACE SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. WHEN THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE INDEX WAS LAST PRODUCED THIS HAS MISPLACED A FOCUS AND RESOURCES ON TO SCHOOLS THAT MAY HAVE VASTLY IMPROVED. THEIR PERFORMANCE OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS SIMILARLY SCHOOLS THAT WOULD THAT WE OUGHT TO BE EVALUATED MAY NOT BE. ON THE OUTDATED LISTS AB FIVE NINE NINE WILL USE EXISTING CSI AND ATS I LESS COMPLY COMPILED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. AS WELL AS SCHOOLS WITH 50% OR MORE TEACHERS WHO DO NOT HOLD A FULL CREDENTIALS. TO IDENTIFY WHICH SCHOOLS NEED TO BE REGULARLY INSPECTED AND RECEIVED SUPPORT. BY SHIFTING THESE MEASURES WE WILL BETTER ENSURE CALIFORNIA FOR FILLED THIS PROMISE TO ITS STUDENTS. AND REDUCE THE GAPS IN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE THAT HAVE BEEN APPLE PIE DURING THIS PANDEMIC. WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY OVER THE PHONE. HIS ERRANT ACTI ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC ADVOCATES. AND BE NOT WILSON ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OF EDUCATION. MODE MEMBERS I. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THEY YOU MISTER JOHNSON JONES T. OF IS ON THE PHONE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ERIN APTIOM LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATE WE ARE PLEASED TO COSPONSOR EIGHTY FIVE NINETY NINE ALONG WITH THE VALUE THE FACT THAT NOT LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. PUBLIC ADVOCATE FOR THE STEEL YOU WERE LEAD COUNSEL AND NOBODY IMPACTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WHICH CLAIMED AT THE STATE AND ITS EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TONIGHT OVER A MILLION CALIFORNIA CHILDREN. THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION BY FAILING TO GIVE THEM BASIC EDUCATION ON THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. THAT THE SAUDIS IN GOOD REPAIR AND TEACHERS APPROPRIATELY QUALIFIED AND ASSIGNED TO TEACH THEIR SUBJECTS AND OUR STUDENTS. THE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR BILLION SETTLEMENT LEGISLATION REQUIRES ALL SCHOOLS TO MEET THE BASIC STANDARDS. REQUIRES THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO CONDUCT INSPECTIONS AND THE LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE EDUCATIONAL NECESSITY ISSUES IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE ATTACK AND CORRECT PROBLEMS. AT THE TIME OF THE SETTLEMENT THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE INDEX WAS USED AS A PROXY FOR WHERE THESE ISSUES ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR. AND IDENTIFIED SCHOOLS EVERY THREE YEARS TO BE INSPECTED ANNUALLY. AB FIVE NINETY NINE REPLACES THE EIGHTY K. I. BASED METHOD FOR SELECTING SCHOOLS TO BE INSPECTED LET'S GO AHEAD AND UPDATE FOR SUPPORT UNDER FEDERAL LAW SPECIFICALLY CSI SCHOOL. WHICH IDENTIFIED BASED ON THE GRADUATION RATE AND LOWEST PERFORMING 5% OF SCHOOLS AND HSI'S WHICH IDENTIFIED SCHOOLS WHERE STUDENT GROUPS MEET ANY OF THE C. S. SECRETARY AFTER LOWEST PERFORMING 5% OF SCHOOLS. BASED ON BACHELOR PERFORMANCE FOR THREE YEARS IN A ROW IT WOULD ALSO ITS CORPORATE 15% OR MORE TEACHER TOLD US IN A FULL CREDENTIAL. TEACHER PREPAREDNESS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT SCHOOL INDICATOR OF STUDENT ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. SCHOOLS WITH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF UNDER CREDENTIALED TEACHERS ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ISSUES WITH THEIR FACILITIES OR INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS EFFICIENCY AS FOR WORKING CONDITIONS LEAD TO HIGHER RATES OF TURNOVER. AND INABILITY TO ATTRACT PREPARED AND EXPERIENCED EDUCATORS. IN LIGHT OF TEACHER EDUCATION AND EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES DURING COLD IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS. TO FULLY CREDENTIALED IMPROPERLY THANK TEACHERS.

AB ONE OH ONE WILL REQUIRE HIGH SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE ETHNIC STUDIES STARTING IN THE ACADEMIC YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. AND STUDENTS TO TAKE AT LEAST ONE SEMESTER OF AN EIGHT THROUGH G. APPROVED ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE TO GRADUATE STARTING. IN. TWENTY TWENTY NINE THIRTY. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT WILL CLARIFY THAT THIS AND THE OTHER GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. APPLY TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATIONS IN THE NATION. ETHNIC MINORITIES ACCOUNT FOR OVER 71% OF THE STUDENT POPULATION. WITH MORE THAN NINETY LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN DISTRICT SCHOOLS. IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS SINCE ETHNIC STUDIES WAS ESTABLISHED AS AN ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE. YET DESPITE DECADES OF SCHOLARSHIP AND ACTIVISM. ETHNIC STUDIES HAS NOT BEEN UNIFORMLY INTEGRATED INTO THE K. TWELVE CLASSROOMS. THE ETHNIC STUDIES AWAIT STATEWIDE ADOPTION DOZENS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING SOME OF THE STATE'S LARGEST HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO OFFER THESE IMPORTANT CLASSES ON THEIR CAMPUSES. STUDENTS TEACHERS AND PARENTS HAVE COME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT CATHOLIC STUDIES PROGRAMS AND IT IS TIME THAT OUR STATE JOIN THEM AS WELL. WE ARE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION RECENTLY APPROVING THE MODEL CURRICULA FOR ETHNIC STUDIES ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX FOR TEACHERS TO USE. AS WE'VE SEEN CIVIL UNREST AND RACIAL TENSION RISE ACROSS THIS NATION CALIFORNIA HAS PRIDED ITSELF AS BEING A PROGRESSIVE BEACON WORKING TO CHART A MORE EQUITABLE FUTURE. IN ORDER TO BUILD RACIAL JUSTICE IN THIS STATE AND COUNTRY OUR STUDENTS NEED TO LEARN A MORE INCLUSIVE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. AND THAT HISTORY INCLUDES THE DIVERSE EXPERIENCES AND PERSPECTIVES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. HERE WITH ME TODAY ON BEHALF OF AB ONE OR ONE. R. DR ALBERT CARILLO. LEON'S LOS MEMORIAL PROFESSOR AND PROFESSOR. AND ALVIN LEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GENERATION UP- THANK YOU- MISTER MEDINA TO THE WITNESSES ON THE PHONE IN SUPPORT. YEAH THIS IS A TOPIC COVERING PROTESTS AMERICAN HISTORY AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEFLY SHARE A FEW COMMENTS WITH YOU IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE ON ONE. FIVE FOLLOW THE PATH OF THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION FOR MANY YEARS AND MOST RECENTLY WAS INVITED BY SUPERINTENDENT TONY% THURMOND AND STAFF REVIEW PARTS OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM RECENTLY ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. NOT FOR ME THERE ARE MANY COMPELLING REASONS TO ENDORSE AB ONE ON ONE I. MENTIONED THREE HERE BRIEFLY. FOR THE REASON CONDUCTED OVER THE PAST DECADES ON THE EFFICACY OF WHAT IS MORE BROADLY TERMED CULTURALLY RELEVANT PEDAGOGY. CONCLUDE THAT SUCH CURRICULUM CONSISTENTLY HAVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND STUDENTS IN GENERAL. THE MOST OF THIS RESEARCH IS QUALITATIVE IN MEMPHIS MORE RECENT QUANTITATIVE FINDINGS BASED ON RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOLS THAT PILOTED ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES FONG SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN DAILY ATTENDANCE GRADE POINT AVERAGE AND COMPLETION OF COURSE CREDITS. ESPECIALLY FOR AT RISK STUDENTS ENROLLED THESE PARTS. I CAN SUPPORT THESE FINDINGS BASED ON MY PILOT PROJECTS OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS WORKING WITH HISTORY TEACHERS. IT'S A TUNE UP EXTENDS CURRICULUM IT TO CHARTER HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA HE'S POBLACHTA ACADEMY I AND LUIS VALDEZ LEADERSHIP ACADEMY IN THE SAN JOSE. I CAN ATTEST THAT STUDENTS WHO ENROLLED IN OUR ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM AT BOTH SCHOOLS FOR MORE INTELLECTUALLY ENGAGED MORE MOTIVATED TO LEARN AND WHICH WILL AND MUCH MORE COLLEGE READY THAN THEIR PEERS WHO DID NOT ENROLL IN THESE COURSES. AND ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE REQUIREMENTS IT'S NOT A SILVER BULLET THIS THE FALL OF TENSE RELATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FOUNDATION TO HELP BUILD THE CITIZENRY THAT HAS GREATER KNOWLEDGE AND MORE APPRECIATION FOR ETHNICALLY. AND RACIALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY. AND IT'S ONE OF THE FOR IS OF AMERICAN STUDIES A LOT BEING STUDIES. IT GIVES ME GREAT PRIDE TO SEE THE OUR STATE CAL. IS ON THE THREAT OF. IN A THE CURRICULUM NOT JUST FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR BECAUSE THIS IS THE- IT IS FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS THIS FOR ALL OF OUR- FUTURE ADULT CITIZENS.

I AM HERE TO TESTIFY AGAINST AB ONE ONE FOR THREE MAIN REASONS FIRST AND FOREMOST IT IS SIMPLY IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO PASS A TAXPAYER FUNDED STATE MANDATE ON ETHNIC STUDIES WHEN TENSIONS CONTROVERSIES AND DISCONNECT THIS AGREEMENT ABOUND REGARDING THE MODEL CURRICULUM. THE FINAL MODEL CURRICULUM IF YOU WROTE IT DOWN CHANGED IDEOLOGY CALL FRAMEWORK OF CRITICAL ETHNIC STUDIES AND CRITICAL PEDAGOGY THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST CRAFTED THE PEDAGOGY TO IMPOSE A BELIEF SYSTEM THAT DIVIDES OUR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ON THE CREW THE BASIS OF SKIN COLOR ALRIGHT IT IS SIMPLY WRONG IN THE STATE SHOULD NOT BOB THAT IS WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS. SECOND TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES IN A CONTEXT THAT IS PREDICATED ON RACIAL DIVISIONS AND ACRYLICS THAT CAUGHT IN THE EPIC COMEBACK THE PRACTICE FUNDAMENTALLY VIOLATES THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE US CONSTITUTION CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF EQUAL TREATMENT AND APRAXIA OF ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS AT FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS INCLUDING ARTICLES THREE AND FOUR AT THE EDUCATION CALLED. THIRD WITH WIDENING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND LEARNING OUTCOME DISPARITIES CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC KEY TO TWELVE EDUCATION IS FACING AN OPPONENT IN EQUITY CRISIS AB ONE ONE WHICH USUALLY RESULT IN A HEFTY PRICE TAG BUT IT IT IT'S EFFECTIVENESS IN IMPROVING QUALITY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IT'S AT BEST ON TEST. I URGE ALL MEMBERS OF THIS ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE TO REJECT AB ONE ONE AND AT THE VOTE YOUR PRECIOUS POLITICAL CAPITAL TO DEVICE COSTING ABOUT COLLUSION TO ADDRESS EXISTING DISPARITIES AND INEQUALITIES. THANK YOU FOR HEARING MY CALL THIS MORNING. THANK YOU DOCTOR LET'S GO TO IT- MODERATOR TO WE HAVE TO ROSS IN ON THE HOME. I DO NOT SEE HER DIAL IN AT A IF SHE IS DIALED IN AS A PER.

YEAH I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO THE AUTHOR HERE I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN YOUR PASSION FOR MANY YEARS AND- I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF BILLS YOU CARE ABOUT THAT AT THE END OF THE- PROFESSOR MEDINA TEN YEAR THIS WILL BE THE ONE THAT I THINK YOU. PROBABLY REMEMBER THE MOUSE AND SO. THIS IS THE YEAR WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN WE'RE GONNA. WORK ON THIS BILL TODAY AND MAKE IT A REALITY PREVENTIVE WORK TO PUT MONEY. IN THE BUDGET FOR DISTRICTS TO BE EARLY ADOPTERS THEN I KNOW YOU'VE ASKED ME BEFORE MY KIDS ARE IN SIXTH GRADE AND HOPEFULLY THEY'RE DISTRICT DOESN'T VOLUNTARY LIKE THEY DO IN YOUR- NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY NINES A LONG TIME- WE LIKE TO SEE IT SOONER BUT I THINK THAT. THIS IS A COMPROMISE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON WITH THE- THE TO THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I WILL SAY THAT IN THIS ERA OF LOOKING AT RECONCILIATION OF RACIAL JUSTICE AND- THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENTS THIS IS IMPORTANT SO THEY KNOW WHO WHO WHAT THEIR FAMILIES LOOK LIKE IN. THEIR FAMILY HISTORY MAKE SURE THAT ALL HISTORY IS TAUGHT BUT ALSO. ON THIS EXTREME DIVISION THAT WE'RE FACING AND THE- AND THE HATE. AND THE NOTION. MORE RACIAL UNDERSTANDING AND TOLERANCE ACT I CAN'T HELP TO THINK THAT MORE. UNDERSTANDING OF. CULTURE AND DIVERSEY AND COMMUTERS OF COLOR BY YOUNG HIGH SCHOOL KIDS. IS ONLY GOING TO HELP THE SITUATION SO. THIS IS CERTAINLY VERY VERY TIMELY AND AGAIN YOU HAVE OUR COMMITMENT. TO WORK IN THE BUDGET PROCESS TO PUT SOME RESOURCES FOR. EARLY IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS THANK YOU MR MEDINA. FUTURE GREAT THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM ANY OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES MISTER BENNETT YEAH UP- SHAKY AUTHORS- EFFORTS ON THIS YOU KNOW THE STRENGTH OF AMERICA'S OUR DIVERSITY BUT THAT DIVERSITY HAS PRESENTED US WITH MANY CHALLENGES- THAT ARE STILL UNRESOLVED. THAT WE HAVE TO WORK ON AND THIS IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF STEPS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS EFFORT IF WE WAIT UNTIL ALL OF THE CONTROVERSY IS OVER WE WILL NEVER MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS STEP AND THAT'S OF. FUNDAMENTAL OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE AND I'M SURE THAT THERE WILL BE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ESSEX DAY CURRICULUM AS WE GO FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT THANK YOU BUT THIS WORKS ALL. WITH AS THE AUTHOR KNOWS EDUCATION IS REALLY THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL WE HAVE TO CREATE- OPEN MINDS TO CREATE- EDUCATION WITH FACTS TO USE CURRICULUM THAT IS NON BIASED I KNOW THAT- THE INSTRUCTIONAL. CORRECT OF. CURRICULUM COMMITTEE HAS BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON THIS SO I LOOK FORWARD. TO THE TIME WHEN WE PRESENT INFORMATION. WHETHER IT'S UPDATED INFORMATION AS WE KNOW EVEN AS TEACHERS OR TEXTBOOKS OVER THE YEARS HAVE CHANGED IN THE VAULT AS WE GET NEW INFORMATION AND HISTORY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF EDUCATION. SO I'D REALLY NOT ONLY SUPPORT THIS BUT I. ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE OPEN ABOUT THIS EDUCATION IS SIMPLY ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN INFORMATION AND THEN THOSE PEOPLE THAT LEARN IT CAN STILL HAVE THEIR OWN OPINIONS ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE INFORMATION THAT'S PRESENTED TO THEM. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED ON IT TIRELESSLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU- MR KILEY. I YEAH YOU KNOW I DON'T DOUBT THAT THERE IS- GREAT VALUE IN IN MANY OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW- IN ELECTIVES- THAT GO BY THE NAME OF EXPECTING STUDIES OR- OR RELATED TOPICS AND- TO THE AUTHOR I DON'T HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT YOUR GOAL. IS TO. REMOTE HEALING AND UNDERSTANDING AND EMPOWERMENT- BUT- MY CONCERN IS THAT. THIS CURRICULUM AS- IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED AS IT'S BEEN ADOPTED IS NOW WE WOULD. UPPER PORTER REQUIRE IT. DOES THE OPPOSITE AND- THE REASON WE KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE PROCESS. YOU HAD VARIOUS GROUPS WHO HAVE COME FORWARD. AND SAID WE FEEL TARGETED BY THIS. WE FEEL LIKE THIS CURRICULUM IS CASTING US IN OUR HISTORY. AND OUR CULTURE. AND OUR BELIEFS AND OUR COMMUNITY. IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT YOU KNOW I'LL THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS- THE- CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS- I THINK THE DOZEN OR SO LEGISLATORS FROM THIS- THIS LEGISLATURE. PUT OUT A LETTER SAYING THAT THIS ECHOES THE PROPAGANDA OF **** GERMANY. AND EVEN WITH THE REVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. YOU STILL HAVE FOLKS IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. AND MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES WILL COME FORWARD TO THIS DOESN'T BUILD UNDERSTANDING THIS DOESN'T BUILD BRIDGES THIS STOKES DIVISION AND- AND RESENTMENT. AND SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW. THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW. WITH THE FIRST DRAFT. DID NOT LEND THEMSELVES TO SORT OF. SERVICE LEVEL DIVISIONS BUT WERE REALLY AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE WAY THIS WHOLE THING. HAS BEEN CONCEIVED SO I SIMPLY DO NOT THINK THAT WHEN WE HAVE A CURRICULUM THAT IS. INSPIRING THAT KIND OF DIVISION IT'S APPROPRIATE AT ALL- FOR US TO. FORCE EVERY STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA- TED TO TAKE IT AND THAT LEADS ME TO MY SECOND POINT THAT EVEN IF. WE DIDN'T THINK THAT THIS CURRICULUM WAS READY FOR THE CLASSROOM IN SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT IS AN ENORMOUS LEAP FROM THAT TO SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT- THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE OF VALUE- THAT ARE BEING TAUGHT AS ELECTIVES ACROSS CALIFORNIA C. T. MANY OTHER. TYPES OF COURSES AND SO I THINK IT'S A PRETTY HIGH BURDEN OF PROOF THE NEEDS TO BE MET THE STATE OF THIS NOW SUDDENLY I NEED TO BE REQUIRED ESPECIALLY WHEN AS ONE OF THE WITNESS NOTED WE HAVE SOME OF THE WORST EDUCATION OUTCOMES IN CALIFORNIA OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY WE HAVE- SOME OF THE WORST ACHIEVEMENT GAPS OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY FOR KIDS IN. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- EVEN BEFORE COBIT NINETEEN WE RANKED FORTY NINTH OUT OF FIFTY OF COURSE WE'VE BEEN THE LAST IN THE COUNTRY IN GETTING KIDS BACK TO THE CLASSROOM I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR. OVER FOUR YEARS AND I SEE TIME AFTER TIME ACTIONS TAKEN THAT WIDEN ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT DISEMPOWER STUDENTS SO. I REALLY THINK THAT IF WE WERE SERIOUS ABOUT EMPOWERING AT KIDS IN CALIFORNIA OF ALL BACKGROUNDS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE EDUCATION REFORMS THAT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN OTHER STATES IN CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. AND% THAT WOULD BE OUR COURSE OF ACTION- IT WOULDN'T BE TO ADOPT A CURRICULUM THAT- THERE'S REALLY NO EVIDENCE IS GOING TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES AND- THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT IT'LL HAVE AN AS SOME BAD EFFECTS ON- THE NATURE OF OUR- COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA TODAY SO I WOULD AT UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO BE VOTING AGAINST THIS TODAY. THANK YOU. AND OTHER MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS JUST TO CLARIFY- YOU DO WANT TO APPLY TO CHARTER SCHOOLS YES THEY TOO. SHOULD- NEED ALL.

DALLY PLEASE TIME LEAI MCCARTY MCCARTY I QUICK SILVA QUICKSILVER I. THE TWO SORRY THE TWO OKAY THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES IT IS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU MR MEDINA THIS PROCEED OUR NEXT BILL THAT IS- AB ONE ZERO FIVE FIVE FILE ITEM FOURTEEN BY MISTER RAMOS BY MISTER ROMANS. WHEN YOU'RE READY MISTER RAMOS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- PRESERVATIVE PRESENT THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS FOR AB TEN FIFTY FIVE. THAT'S MY COLLEAGUES HERE ARE AWARE OUR STATE HAS A HISTORY OF INEQUITY TO THE TREATMENT OF CALIFORNIA NATIVE PEOPLE WE ALMOST WORK TOWARDS HEALING FROM THE PAST OUR COLLECTIVE HISTORY INCLUDES MANY MISGUIDED POLICIES. AIMED AT TRAVEL CHILDREN ESPECIALLY IN THE REALM OF EDUCATION ONE EXAMPLE IS THE HISTORY OF BOARDING SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TOWARDS THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ELIMINATING THEIR LANGUAGE AND THEIR THEIR CULTURE MOVING FORWARD. NATIVE YOU FACE SOME OF THE LOWEST HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES AND EVEN FEWER ENROLL IN AND GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE. IN SEVEN STATES WITH THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF NATIVE AMERICANS WITH CALIFORNIA BEING THE NUMBER ONE. ON AVERAGE LESS THAN 50% OF NATIVE STUDENTS GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. FURTHER WE KNOW THAT FOSTER YOU. ALSO HAVE FAR WORSE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES THEN THEIR SCHOOL PEERS IN GENERAL. AB TEN FIFTY FIVE HELPS EXPAND A. B. NINETEEN SIXTY TWO. WHICH EXTENDED THE DEFINITION OF A STUDENT IN FOSTER CARE TO STUDENTS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF TRIBAL COURTS WITHOUT EXTENDING DISASSOCIATED SERVICES. THIS MEANS NATIVE AMERICAN FOSTER CARE STUDENTS ARE NOT AFFORDED THE SUPPORT SERVICES AND NECESSARY RESOURCES OF THEIR PEERS. AB TEN FIFTY FIVE BUILDS ON THE WOULD MEASURE BILL BY INCLUDING NATIVE FOSTER YOUTH IN THE PROTECTION AND SERVICES OFFERED TO OTHER YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE. THIS BILL. WOULD RELIEVE ALLEY AS FROM THE OBLIGATION TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION OF TRIBAL COURT AND INSTEAD ALLOW TRIBES TO INITIATE NOTICE. MISTER CHAIR. THERE IS A JUDGE JUDGE CLAUDETTE WHITE CHIEF JUDGE OF THE QUICK CHON TRIBAL COURT THAT BROUGHT THIS LANGUAGE TO ME IN THIS ISSUE TO ME AND IT'S SAD TO SAY THAT SHE SUCCUMBED TO CARBON NINETEEN IN FEBRUARY AT THE AGE OF FORTY NINE. A QUICK JOHN MEMBER WHO BECAME CHIEF JUDGE SEEN THE DISPARITIES HAPPENING TO OUR INDIAN KIDS JUDGE WHY IT WAS A TOWERING FIGURE IN INDIAN LAW AND TRIBAL COURTS AND PASSIONATE ADVOCATE FOR NATIVE AMERICANS. WITH ME TODAY. IS MICHELLE PERATA ADMINISTRATOR OF ALL TRIBES AMERICAN INDIAN CHARTER SCHOOLS IN KIMBERLY CLOUGH LEGAL DIRECTOR FROM CALIFORNIA TRIBAL FAMILIES COALITION. AND THEY WILL BE OFFERING TESTIMONY THANK YOU WE WILL NOT GO TO YOUR WITNESS IS I BELIEVE MISS CLUB IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT I BELIEVE SHE IS A SHE IS GOING TO MAKE IT OKAY I I'M INCORRECT ON THAT SOAP. SO TEAR WITNESSES ON THE PHONE. NUMBER LIKE WHAT. GOOD MORNING I AM THE LEGAL DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA TRAVEL FAMILIES COALITION. HFT IS A TRIBAL COALITION OF OVER FORTY CALIFORNIA TRIBES AND TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS HFT IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROB US FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN ADDRESSING THE SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES. THAT CALIFORNIA TROUBLED COMMUNITY STATE. I DON'T THINK THE COMEDIAN COMMITTEE STAFF AND WE HAVE GLADLY ACCEPTED THE REQUESTED AMENDMENTS. AB ONE FIFTY FIVE WHICH BROUGHT FORWARD IN ORDER CAN MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PRIOR BILL AB NINETEEN SIXTY TWO MORE SEAMLESS AND THE FACT THAT. AS IT OFTEN HAPPENS WE HAVE LEARNED LESSONS SINCE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO WITH PASSED. IN YOU COMPLICATED FOSTER USE AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM SOMETIMES WE NEED CLARITY ON THE IMPLEMENTATION. ESPECIALLY WITH EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT- TRAVEL FASTER YOUTH AND ALSO STUDENTS UNDER VOLUNTARY PLACEMENT AGREE. THE EDUCATION CODE SUPPORTS IN EXISTING LAW THAT WE WANT TO EXPAND AND SECURE FOR FOSTER YOUTH THEIR COMMON SENSE FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE COOL FEES SUCH AS THE TEXTBOOK OR LIBRARY FEASIBLE FOSTER CHILD WILL NOT BE PREVENTED IN ROLLING AND START TO GET INTO SCHOOL AND THEY HAVE THE MOVE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MOVE FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT. PRETTY COMMON. AN EXEMPLARY CLARIFICATION THAT THIS BILL MAKES. IS IN RELATION TO WHEN THE TRIBAL COURTS MAKE THEIR FINDINGS THE LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES TRIBAL COURTS TO MAKE A FINDING UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. BUT TRAVEL COURT JUDGES THEY NEED TO LOOK TO TRIBAL WHAT. SO THIS I JUST BUILDING IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO THAT WE HAVE AN EIGHTY TEN FIFTY FIVE WILL ALLOW TRIBAL COURT JUDGES TO MAKE THE NEED OF FINDING THE TRIBAL CHILDREN THAT ARE FOSTER CHILDREN UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION. CAN STILL BENEFIT FROM THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE BENEFITS. THIS BILL AMENDS STATE LAW WE HAVE CLARITY ON THE TRIBAL COURT FIGHTS IN THE STATE EDUCATIONAL FIVE ON HOW WE MAKE THE BENEFITS RUN TO TRAVEL FOSTER YOU. EITHER COMMONSENSE SOLUTION WE SUMMARIZE NEED TO IMPLEMENT THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOU RESPECTFULLY ASK THEIR AYE VOTE ON EIGHTY TEN FIFTY FIVE THANK YOU TO THE NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THE TYPICAL TIME CALIFORNIA'S WE FACE AN EQUITIES IN THE PAST AND FORGE FORWARD. IN YOUR BILL AVOID HER TRIBE AND OUR PEOPLE IT IS DEEPLY APPRECIATED. MORNING AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHELLE PRODUCTS I MILLION CONTRACT WILL MEMBERS A FOSTER PARENT ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF ALL TRIBES AMERICAN INDIAN CHARTER SCHOOL. HONORING QUALITY RESERVATIONS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. URINE OUR TWENTIETH YEAR AS A CALIFORNIA CREDIT THE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL. WE ALL TRIED SCHOOL STIRS PK THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. WE FOUND OF THE SCHOOL DRESS ISSUES. WE SAW IN OUR COMMUNITY INCLUDING LOWER ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND LOW GRADUATION RATES. THIS SCHOOL YEAR WE HAVE A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR STUDENTS WHO COME FROM MORE THAN TWELVE RESERVATIONS AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA. WE SEE FIRSTHAND THE IMPACT OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. ISSUES THE STUDENTS FACE COULD NOT CHANGE WHETHER THEY ARE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM TO THE STATE COURT OR TRAVEL COURT. ORDINATOR STUDENTS LEAD THE SECTOR SUPPORTS THAT THE EDUCATION CODE PROVIDES. I'D LIKE TO TELL YOUR STORY. WE HAVE A SIBLING GROUP OF FIVE CHILDREN IN OUR SCHOOL THE THREE OLDEST CHILDREN PLACED WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS. THROUGH THE TROUBLES WITH THE- YOUNGEST TO THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA CAR SYSTEM. THREE OLDER CHILDREN SHE VIRTUALLY ZERO SUPPORT THE FOSTER YOUTH. THEY DO NOT GET EXTRA SUPPORT. IN THEIR SCHOOLS. AND THE GRANDPARENTS DO NOT GET EXTRA SUPPORT FINANCIALLY. THE TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN THAT ARE IN THE COUNTY FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. GET EXTRA SUPPORT IN THEIR EDUCATION AND THEIR GRANDPARENTS GIVE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THEM. UNFORTUNATELY THE TWO YOUNGER ONES HAVING BEEN THROUGH THE COUNTY FOSTER CARE SYSTEM- MORE TRAUMATIZED. STRUGGLE MORE WITH SEVEN SEVEN MULTIPLE FOSTER HOMES. BEFORE THEY FINALLY GOT PLACE FOR THE GRANDPARENTS. THE POINT IS THAT THE TROUBLED FOSTER CARE SYSTEMS ARE BETTER CAñADA CHILDREN BUT WE MUST ENSURE THAT THESE TRAVEL CHILDREN DON'T LOSE OUT ON THE BENEFITS. OF STATE LAW EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT BILL. I HAVE TROUBLE. THANK YOU I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WHY DON'T WE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DO WE HAVE A MOTION. IT'S BEEN MOVED.

YOU MAY RECEIVE AN READY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU AB FOUR SIX NINE WHICH REQUIRES LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES OR ELLIE AS TO ENSURE THAT ALL HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS COMPLETE THE PHELPS PHONE OR CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION TO FOR FINANCIAL AID BEFORE GRADUATING THIS BILL IS ALIGNED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND IS A LATINO CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL. IT IS SUPPORTED BY GROUPS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THE LOTUS WHAT THE FOUNDATION AND OUR SPONSOR EDUCATION TRUST WEST. CUPBOARD NINETEEN EXACERBATED AT THE UNESCO THE STUDENTS FACE WHEN APPLYING FOR COLLEGE. INCLUDING COMPLETING FINANCIAL AID FORMS. IN THE PAST YEAR OUR STATE SAW 5%DECREASE IN PHELPS WERE APPLICATIONS AND A THIRTEEN DECREASE IN CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY THE LARGEST IMPACTS ARE FELT BY LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO PROBABLY WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED. MANY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS DO NOT COMPLETE A FINANCIAL AID FORM BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE INELIGIBLE HAVE LITTLE INFORMATION ON HOW TO APPLY OR LACKS SUPPORT IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE NEARLY HALF A MILLION. HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS IN CALIFORNIA DID NOT COMPLETE THE PHELPS WERE OR THE DREAM ACT. APPLICATION LEAVING AN ESTIMATED FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID ON THE TABLE. AB FOUR SIX NINE INSURERS ALL STUDENTS GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO SUPPORT CRITICAL FORMS FOR FINANCIAL AID. CALIFORNIA TYPICALLY LEADS THE NATION A PROGRESSIVE POLICY MAKING BUT IN TERMS OF PHELPS FOR COMPLETION OUR STATE IS FALLING BEHIND OTHER STATES SUCH AS LOUISIANA TENNESSEE AND TEXAS HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED SIMILAR STATEWIDE POLICIES. AND THEIR STUDENTS HAVE REAPED THE BENEFITS IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO JOIN THE EFFORT. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO HAVE PROTECTIONS ALSO FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS BY EXPLICITLY REFERENCING STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS. IT ALSO EQUIPS ELEAZAR WITH THE GUIDANCE THEY NEED TO IMPLEMENTED THIS REQUIREMENT BY OUTLINING THE RESOURCES TO WHICH THEY CAN DIRECT STUDENTS FOR SUPPORT. HERE TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ARE COMPELLING ENOUGH TO POINT THIS CHAIR THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS. AT THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AS WELL AS MIKE MCCORMICK SUPERINTENDENT OF ALBERDI UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO THE- WITNESSES. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING A MEMBER YES I MY NAME IS TIMOTHY CUENTA UNLIKE RICHARD EARLIER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AT A LOCAL FORTUNATE TO BE THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND HIS OFFERING DIGITAL CAMPFIRE ARE CONCERNED AFTER ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT-WHAT COULD HAPPEN OF THIS BILL WHAT IT WOULD AFFECT OUR STUDENTS.

ARE DOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND HOW WE SUPPORT THEM ENCOURAGE THE COMMISSION OF WORKING ON ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND TRAINING WE DO THE WORK NOW WITH ARE UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES AND THE GOAL IS TO NOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEM TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE DARK AND THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR STATE OUR DOCUMENTS FAMILIES DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS MORE THAN 65% OF OUR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE FIRST GENERATION AND SO THEY NEED HELP THEY NEED SUPPORT FOR THEIR MAKING AN UNEDUCATED DECISION NOT. A MINUTE BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER SO THE COMMISSION IS COMMITTED IN THE FEEDBACK TEAM COMMITTED. TO IF PATH TO EXPAND YOU. TRAINING TO ENSURE THEY HAVE. IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT LEN PERFECT. IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND OF. IN WE'RE- MILLIONS OF OLLARS FEDERAL DOLLARS IN CAN BRING TO OUR STATE OUR COMMUNITY. IF WE JUST HAVE A FEW. THE MESROP OF.

THIS COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT NEARLY A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA ALONE IS LEFT ON THE TABLE AND UNCLAIMED FINANCIAL AID FOR GRADUATING SENIORS. SERVIDOR Y. TO MAKE FAST WHEN CAPTAIN POLLUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR SCHOLARS WILL BE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE GOING GRADUATES AND WE ALSO KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO SYSTEMATICALLY REMOVE THE NUMBER ONE BARRIER.

FIRST OF ALL MISS REYES I'D LIKE TO SAY I APPRECIATE YOUR BILL APPRECIATE THE MISSION OF YOUR BILL. WHICH IS TO OFFER A HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES TO ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS I ALSO APPRECIATE. THE COMMENTS HERE TODAY MOST OF THE SPEAKERS THAT RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE COMMENTS I MADE THE PAST. AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER THAT'S HOW TO IMPLEMENT A POLICY LIKE THIS A PRACTICE LIKE THIS- IN THE PAST. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AND- THE COMMENTS BY THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND ALSO OUR EFFORT REALLY WHICH IS. WILL COMPLEMENT THE SEVEN I THINK IS STREAMLINING THE WHOLE FINANCIAL AID SEEKING PROCESS VERY NECESSARY SO CONFUSING. HAS BEEN CONFUSING FOR YEARS I KNOW MR MCCARTY IS LET THAT ON THAT EFFORT TO. AND I KNOW YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT TOO AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AS WELL WITH THAT ANY OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WISH TO COMMENT MISTER KILEY. I JUST WANT EXPRESSED MY SUPPORT I THINK IT'S A- VERY GOOD BILL WE HAVE THAT AS YOU MENTIONED- YOU KNOW- TO LOWER THE PERCENTAGE OF. STUDENTS WHO GO THROUGH THIS AND MISS OUT ON ON POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WAS MCCARTY. YEAH I THINK YOU- YOU KNOW WE DISCUSS THIS AS YOU KNOW- MISTER CHAIR A LOT AND BUDGET COMMITTEE AS WELL THIS IS A CONCURRENT. BILL I JUST SAY ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE MOST DISTRESSING THINGS THAT I DO AS CHAIR THE BUDGET FOR LAST SEVEN YEARS AS EVERY YEAR WE GET A DOLLAR AMOUNT OF HOW MUCH MONEY. GOES BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND WHICH WAS ALLOCATED FOR CAL GRANT AND IS NOT GIVEN OUT TO STUDENTS WHO ARE WORTHY AND SHOULD GO BECAUSE THEY DON'T. FILL OUT THE APPLICATION. AND TOO MANY HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS ARE DEALING WITH JUST LIFE THEY'RE DEALING WITH. CRISIS IN HOUSE KIDS THAT ARE HOMELESS AND POVERTY AND EVERYTHING ELSE I DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TIME TO BE THAT TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC COUNSELORS AND THE COUNSELOR RATIOS ARE. ARE ARE REALLY WILL FALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SO THIS IS DEFINITELY NEEDED. WE HAVE AN ENTITLEMENT THAT CAL GRANT PROGRAMS FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS NOW IN CALIFORNIA THAT IF YOU HAVE A- TWO POINT NOW AND YOU'RE A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. YOU APPLY YOU GET A CALTRAIN GUARANTEED THE STATE MONEY FOR YOU BUT IF YOU APPLY THE NEXT YEAR. OR TWO THIRDS TWO YEARS LATER YOUR ODDS OF GETTING IT ARE LIKE ONE IN FIVE. SO IT'S A NO BRAINER TO HELP STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE BEAN COUNTERS THERE DON'T WANT THIS THEY WANT TO USE THIS MONEY FOR ELSEWHERE IN THE BUDGET BUT WE HAVE THIS VISION TWENTY YEARS AGO- ARE FIRED FORMER CENTER JABBER TCI THINK WHO YOU KNOW VERY WELL. AUTHORED THIS LANDMARK BILL AND WE'RE NOT THE FILLING THE POTENTIAL. FOR COLLEGE FOR EVERYBODY AND NOT IT WAS GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY. NO KNOWING THAT THEY HAVE MONEY TO PAY FOR TUITION. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE NEED THE STUDENTS TO SUCCEED NOT JUST FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEIR UPWARD MOBILITY BUT FOR ECONOMY YOU KNOW WE NEED MANY MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES TO FILL THE JOBS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW SO THIS IS DESPERATE NEED FOR OUR ECONOMY. AND SO THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO PUSH US FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS THANKS. THANK MISS CLARK SILVA. THANK ECHO MY COLLEAGUES ON AND- THIS DOCUMENT WITH THIS PRESENTED TO US FROM OUR OWN.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF- TANYA FOR HER WERE WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL- I ALSO WANT TO ACCEPT THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS OUTLINED pTHE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OF AB THIRTEEN SIXTY THREE IS A WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL THIS BILL WOULD DEVELOP A STANDARD PROCESS FOR STATE PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS TO IDENTIFY THE DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS THAT THEY IN ROLAND SERVE. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE PROVIDERS TO REPORT KEY INFORMATION ABOUT DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS TO THE STATE IN ORDER TO FOR FUTURE POLICY AND PROGRAM DECISIONS TO BE MADE. THIS BILL THE PORTENT BECAUSE 60% OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA FROM BIRTH TO AGE FIVE LIVE IN HOUSEHOLDS IN WHICH A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH IS SPOKEN. HOWEVER THERE'S NO CONSISTENT MANNER OF IDENTIFYING DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS IN CALIFORNIA'S EARLY LEARNING SYSTEM. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ACHIEVING FLUENCY IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES BENEFITS CHILDREN BY BROADENING THEIR COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY ENHANCING THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN AND GIVING STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME. BI OR MULTILINGUAL SO THAT THEY ARE COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL WORK FORCE THE RESEARCH ALSO TELLS US THAT. THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE LEARNING AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT OF THE L. L. CHILDREN TO NURTURE THE RICH LINGUISTIC ASSETS AND TO ENSURE SUCCESS IN SCHOOL AND IN LIFE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE INTENTIONAL SUPPORT DESIGN FOR THE SUCCESS OF DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS WHEN THEY ENTER PRESCHOOL- IN DECEMBER THE GOVERNOR RELEASED THE MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE. A TEN YEAR ROAD MAP FOR IMPROVING AND TRANSFORMING THE STATE'S EARLY LEARNING AND CARE SYSTEM. THE MASTER PLAN PROVIDES A ROADMAP TO ADDRESS RACIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUITIES AND CALLS FOR LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE L. L.'S DEVELOPMENTAL ASSESSMENTS BOTH IN ENGLISH AND IN THE CHILDREN'S HOME LANGUAGES AMONG OTHER THINGS. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY THREE TAKES THE FIRST CRITICAL STEP IN IMPLEMENTING THE MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE- RECOMMENDATIONS SUPPORTING OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS BY FIRST IDENTIFYING THEM. TO DATE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I HAVE CAROLINE CROWELL HELLO. DIRECTOR OF DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNER PROGRAMS AND JESSICA GOOD THE ADDRESS C. S. P. P. TEACHER.

WE WERE EXCITED TO SEE SUCH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON SUPPORTING GALLOP IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING ND CARE. INCLUDING THE NEED TO IDENTIFY DEVELOP ACROSS ALL EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAM. WE BELIEVE THAT BY BRINGING THE POLITICS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN BE A LEADER IN THE NATION IN SUPPORTING AND UPLIFTING THE ASPECTS OF OUR DOOR LANGUAGE LEARNERS. FISHER MORE ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THE POLICY ON PROVIDERS FEATURED FAMILIES AND CHILDREN I'M GOING TO DEFER THE REST OF MY TIME. TO OUR OTHER WITNESS THAT'S GOOD WITH THE ADDED. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE ABOUT MY WILL HAVE AN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR WHAT WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE PERSPECTIVE FROM WHICH I'LL BE SPEAKING. I'M CURRENTLY WORKING IN FRESNO UNIFIED STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AND FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN A PARTICIPANT IN THE LANGUAGE LEARNING PROJECT WHICH SEEKS TO IMPROVE THE PRACTICE OF THE EASY WORK FORCE TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF BILL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. OUR PROGRAM IS RECOGNIZED AS A PROMISING NOT ONLY WITH THE FUNDING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AS AN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE THE GREAT FORTUNE TO THE DIVERSE GROUP OF CHILDREN FAMILIES WHO SPEAK MANY LANGUAGES I'MONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE EXPERIENCES FROM MY PARTICIPATION IN THE LANGUAGE LEARNING PROJECT HAS BEEN LEARNING A PROCESS WHICH TO IDENTIFY THE BUILDING WOULD LEARN IN MY CLASSROOM. THE PROFIT BY USING VERY SIMILAR TO THAT IDENTIFIED IN AB THIRTEEN SIXTY THREE ABOUT POINT SO GRATEFUL THAT THE BILL BEING HEARD BY YOU ALL TODAY I USE A TOOL CALLED THE FAMILY LANGUAGE IS AN INTERESTING OF YOU TO GUIDE MY CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILIES ABOUT THE CULTURE LANGUAGE THAT IDENTIFIES. THE CAR OUT OF THE DOOR LANGUAGE LEARNER. YOU THE PLAN IF YOU'RE TO IDENTIFY THE L. L. BECOME. INVOLVED PART OF MY TEACHING FOR. THE COMMERCE. ABOUT A FAIR. PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO GATHER DATA THEN IMPLEMENT STRUCTURE. AND REALLY GUIDES LEARNING EXPERIENCES IN MY CLASSROOM. THE DATA GATHERED NOT ONLY FOR MY TEACHING PRACTICE IN THE CLASSROOM. BUT IT ALSO INFORMS PROGRAM DECISIONS IN ALLOCATING RESOURCES TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND FAMILY. MEMBERS SO MANY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT WE AS EDUCATORS MUST CONSIDER TO ENSURE THAT WERE BACK. IN THE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WE SERVE. PROPER THOUGHT A PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING THE LANGUAGE LEARNERS MAY SEEM LIKE A BURDENSOME TASK. THAT'S BEING ADDED TO AN ALREADY LONG LIST OF PRIORITIES. AND HONESTLY I HAD SIMILAR THINKING WHEN I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT IT AFFECTING UNIFIED. HOWEVER WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO EASILY INTEGRATE THAT CONVERSATION AND HARD TO THINK STRUCTURE OF ENGAGING AND MEETING WITH FAMILIES. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW INVALUABLE THE PROCESS OF BECOMING MY TEACHING PRACTICE. AS EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS WE HAVE THE GREAT HONOR AND RESPONSIBILITY OF SERVING OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS. BUT HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS IF WE CAN IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE NEEDS. ARE DEALING WOODLAND IDENTIFICATION IS A CRITICAL STEP IN PLANNING LEARNING EXPERIENCES AND INSTRUCTION AND THOUGHT THAT THE EXTRA ITEMS. BUT HE JUST HAD TO OUR TO DO LIST. BUT THEN IN A ROW PLEASE SUMMARIZE FAMILIES. BELIEVE OF THE CHILDREN WE SERVE. AN DINNER TO DEATH A DEEPER. INTENTIONALITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE WE HAVE ONE MORE WITNESS NOT ONE WITNESS HAVE.

WEEKS WITH YOUR STAFF AND YOUR TEAM THAT NO SHE'S NOT HERE BUT I WANT TO THANK DEBBIE LUCK YOUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANT WHO WORKED ON THIS AND ROAD OUTSTANDING ANALYSIS OF THE ISSUE. AND OUT OF THE GATE WE WILL UPSET WE WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS SOME CLARIFICATIONS THAT WE WANNA MAKE SURE WE- AT HERE TOO SO- THIS OF COURSE IS AB TWENTY TWO. A UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN YOU'LL GIVE EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO THE FULL. YEAR OF HIGH QUALITY FULL DAY PRESCHOOL AT NO COST TO THEIR FAMILIES BY EXPANDING UNIVERSAL TEEKAY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AS WE NOW WE HAVE A TEN YEAR PILOT PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA WITH T. K. SO FOR FAMILIES ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A CHILD BORN IN THE FALL. THEY HAVE A FREE YEAR OF PUBLICLY FUNDED EARLY EDUCATION BUT AS WE'VE SEEN THE LAST TEN YEARS PARENTS AT THE SOCCER FIELD ARE ASKING AROUND LIKE HOW DID YOU GET FREE PRE K. WHAT DO YOU MEAN- HOUSE BUT YOUR BABY WAS BORN IN. IN OCTOBER OR SEPTEMBER NOVEMBER SELL AT IT IS THIS REALLY ADDRESSES THAT INEQUITY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT COULD EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EARLY AT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT ECP MATTERS- HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES IMPROVE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT SCHOOL READINESS AND A LONG TERM ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT T. K. SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES KINDERGARTEN READINESS. PUTTING CHILDREN AHEAD OF THEIR NON TKT PIERCED BY UP TO SIX MONTHS IN SOME ACADEMIC SKILLS MORE IMPORTANTLY WE THINK WE CAN HELP HERE IN CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME STUDENTS- DIVERSE STUDENTS ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BENEFIT THE MOST FROM TEEKAY ACCORDING TO RESEARCH MAKE IT MAKING UNIVERSAL T. K. A POWERFUL STRATEGY IN NARROWING. THE OPPORTUNITY AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM WHICH IS. OUR LINGERING ISSUE WERE TRYING TO A DRESS BY THIS BILL OFF IMPLY THAT'S JUST QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING. DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE CURRICULUM AND STAFFING RATIOS SO THAT EDUCATORS CAN MEANINGFUL MEANINGFULLY INTERACT WITH THE CHILD WE'LL MAKE SURE WE HAVE RATIOS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE ME NOW- YOU KNOW MR DONAHUE TALK A LOT ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A TEACHER AND HAVING A T. K. TEACHER WITH TWENTY FIVE THIRTY KIDS THAT DOESN'T QUITE WORK. AS IT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR THE TEACHER AND THE KIDS SO IN HERE WE HAVE APPROPRIATE RATIOS. MORE IMPORTANTLY WE KNOW THAT BY JUST MOVING ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS IN THE T. K. WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR THE PROGRAM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE'VE HEARD THEM LOUD AND CLEAR. WE'RE GONNA THERE'S NO OFFICIAL OPPOSITION BUT THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE CONCERNED WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THEM I'M SURE WITNESSES LATER. OTHERS A COMPANION BILL IN THE SENATE AUTHORED BY CENTRALLY MON WHICH WOULD STATE THAT OF THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING THAT CURRENTLY GOES TO SERVE FOUR YEAR OLDS IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. WE WOULD USE THOSE MONIES TO SERVE MARK ZERO THREE THREE YEAR OLDS SO- THOSE PROGRAMS COULD SERVE MORE INFANTS AND TODDLERS WHAT'S YOURS THERE GREATER NEED. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THINK ABOUT THE KIDS WHO WHO NEED EARLY EDUCATION NOW THESE LOW INCOME KIDS WOULD HAVE ONE YEAR. OF FREE PRE K. THROUGH THE TICKET PROGRAM AND THEY CAN OTHER YEAR OF STATE PRESCHOOL IN THE THREE SO TWO YEARS OF QUALITY EASY EATING. WILL REALLY ADDRESS ARE CHEAP AN OPPORTUNITY. GAP ISSUES- K. NEEDS THIS WE NEED THE SHOT IN THE ARM TO MAKE SURE WE PREPARE OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS- AB TWENTY TWO ISN'T THE ENTIRE SOLUTION BT IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE- THE GOVERNOR HAS EMBRACE THIS BY PUTTING ONE TIME IN THE BUDGET. TO JUMPSTART IMPLEMENTATION OF TEEKAY THIS WOULD FURTHER THIS EFFORT. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM- EDUCATOR'S SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS I ONE LAST THING TO WE KNOW WE HAVE TO CLIMBING ENROLLMENTS. ACROSS CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS SO THIS WOULD HELP SOME OF THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH DECLINING ENROLLMENT TO GET MORE EIGHTY EIGHT. IN THEIR IN THEIR IN THEIR- SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND LASTLY ONE THE BIG PIECES FAR AS FUNDING THIS WEEK JUST TO SAY IT OUT RIGHT- THERE WAS WHEN WE STARTED THIS BILL IT WOULD HAVE FUNDED T. K. THROUGH THE EXISTING ALLOTMENT. UNDER THAT TO THE TEST ONE PROP NINETY EIGHT. WE THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO BEYOND THAT AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING- FOR EACH ADDITIONAL STUDENT WHO COMES IN THE T. K.

I WANTED TO ASK REAL QUICK QUESTION. CONSCIOUS OF IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THE- OPPOSITION BECAUSE- IT WAS QUITE A BIT CAN I JUST SHARE ONE THING. THERE I HEARD OPPOSITION BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD Y. YES THAT FIFTH. NO NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YET PEOPLE CAME ON AND SAID THEY WERE OPPOSED A LOT DO THAT QUOTE YES YEAH BUT I DON'T THINK THERE WAS NO REASON SO I DON'T KNOW THE MISTER MCCARTY SHOULD BE MAKING THEM UP AT ALL. I LET HIM YEAH I THOUGHT I WILL ALL ALL ADDRESS WE DID RECEIVE A LETTER OF CONCERN LAST NIGHT WHICH TURNED INTO A LETTER O OPPOSITION TODAY AND IT SUB OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO DO THE CHANGE I JUST WANNA DRESS KIND OF THE BIG ISSUE. IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA DO TREMENDOUS JOB SERVING FOUR YEAR OLDS AND CHANGE OF HEART I THINK PEOPLE ARE SCARED WHAT WHAT HAPPENED AND IF WE DID THIS BILL BY ITSELF WITHOUT THE LIMóN COMPANION BILL IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM BUT AS ART WITNESS SAID EARLIER FROM CONTANGO. HALF ITS POPULATION IS SERVING FOUR YEAR OLDS AND OF THIS BILL WENT THROUGH WHAT HE WOULD DO BY DEFINITION THERE ARE JUST AS MANY THREE YEAR OLDS AS THERE ARE FOR GIRLS AND THERE ARE. THAT YOU KNOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLD WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO STATE PRESCHOOL RIGHT NOW SO WHAT THAT GOAL HERE BECAUSE WE WOULD SERVE MORE THREE YEAR OLDS AND EVEN MORE WE'D GO DOWN AND SERVE LOWER FOR ZERO. THREE THREE SO SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS THEY WANT US TO NOT- TELL THEM BUT SHOW THEM AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT WORKED WORK THREATENING STRENGTHENING THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL AND OUR COMPANION BILL- YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT THE OTHER ISSUE TOO IS THAT HEAD START PROGRAMS- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SECOND PRESENT VEITNER TALKING ABOUT SERVING MORE KIDS THREE ZERO THREE THREE IN HEAD START. SO YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT THERE'S A MAGIC SWEET SPOTS ON THESE PROGRAMS THINK THAT FOUR YEAR OLDS REALLY ARE THAT ECONOMIC TOOL THAT MAKES THEM FINANCIALLY VIABLE. BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING THIS. FOR THE PROGRAMS- FOR CAN. I WOULD ARGUE WERE DOING THIS FOR QUE AND FAMILIES AND- WE'RE MAKE% SURE THEY WE HAVE FOR THE WRAP OF THE- DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATE CURRICULUM. AND THERE ARE SOME PRIVATE- PROGRAMS THAT DON'T GET ANY STATE SUBSIDIES THAT WORRY THAT STUDENTS. LIKE YOU KNOW THE DOLLY FAMILY TWENTY YEARS AGO WILL TAKE THE FREE. PUBLICLY FUNDED SCHOOL AND NOT PAY. FOR A. T. K. WELL IT'S STILL VOLUNTARY IT'S NOT WE'RE NOT FORCING FAMILIES TO GO TO T. K. IF THEY STILL WANT TO PAY. TO GO TO A PRIVATE PROGRAM. THAT'S THEIR CHOICE THAT STILL AVAILABLE BUT WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST. AT KIDS AND FAMILIES AND AGAIN FOR OUR FOR OUR PROGRAMS THAT HAD STATE SUBSIDIES IT SIR FOUR YEAR OLDS. WE HEAR YOU WERE WORKING WITH YOU AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- HAVE YOU BE ABLE TO THRIVE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HELP KIDS AND FAMILIES THRIVE BY GETTING. A YEAR OF PUBLICLY FUNDED TEEKAY AND- HELP YOU SERVE MORE ZERO THREE THREE YEAR OLDS- THANK YOU FAMILY MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION. I THANK YOU SO THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND. ARE YOU MAY CLOSE MAYBE THAT WAS YOUR CLOTHES I DON'T KNOW MUCH MCCARTY BUT YEAH I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS THA ISSUE AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT SOME OTHER CONCERNS I KNOW SOME LABOR GROUPS HAVE ASKED HOW THIS DEALS WITH. THE WORK FORCE AND WE FEEL THAT THERE ARE AS OUR SPEAKER SAID EARLIER THERE IS A PATH THAT CURRENT WORKERS IN PRE K. THEY HAVE THREE CHOICES THEY COULD STAY AND SERVE MORE THREE YEAR OLDS- ZERO THREE THREE YEAR OLDS. THEY CAN BECOME A PART PROFESSIONAL AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL SITE AND FRANKLY GET A INCREASE IN COMPENSATION OR THEY CAN STEP IT UP WITH THE MONEY WE'RE PUTTING IN THE BUDGET. AND GET A CREDENTIAL AND BECOME A T. K. TEACHER BECOME OCCUR LICENSE CREDENTIAL TEACHERS SO THERE ARE THREE PASSED FOR EDUCATORS I JUST THE BIG PICTURE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF THE DAY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CALIFORNIA. THE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY AND SHIPMENT GAP- INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY AND FRANKLY CREEK CRIME ISSUES IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE EVERY ECONOMIST NOBLE LAUREATES INSTEAD OF IS ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO.

AB TWENTY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL. HI DONNA HI KYLIE. KILEY AYE BENNETT AYE BENNETT AYE DALY. DALY I'D LI. LI I MCCARTY BY MCCARTY AYE CORK SILVA. QUICKSILVER I SEVEN BOTH THE BILL CERVANTES OUT THANK YOU GRADUATION HAS MCCARTY WILL NOW MOVE ON TO- AB SEVENTY FIVE BY O'DONNELL. FINAL TURNOVER MISTER KILEY. AND- I DON'T KNOW ARE YOU. HELLO GRANTED TRAVELER THIS IS. OKAY. THANK YOU. I WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM LIKE. THIS IS AB SEVENTY FIVE DONALD HE MAY PROCEED ON READY. THANK YOU A THANK YOU I AM I CORRECT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB SEVENTY FIVE PLACES A KINDERGARTEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE SCHOOL FACILITIES BOND ON THE TWENTY TWENTY TO BALLOT. THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM IS A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THAT IS BASED ON A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND DEVELOPERS. STATE BOND FUNDS HAVE BEEN MATCHED BY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOCAL BONDS AND DEVELOPER FEES. TOGETHER THESE FUNDS TO BUILD NEW SCHOOLS MODERNIZE AGING FACILITIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SAFE AND UPDATED. AND SUPPORTED VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THESE FUNDS ALSO HELP THE ECONOMY BY GENERATING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS. THE FUNDS FOR THE LAST BOND APPROVED BY VOTERS. OPPOSITION FIFTY ONE FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE ALREADY DEPLETED ON THE K. TWELVE SIDE ABOUT TWO BILLION APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED BEYOND AVAILABLE FUNDING THE NEED IS GREAT IN FACT THE AVERAGE AGE OF A SCHOOL FACILITY IN CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE IS AROUND SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD. WE ALL KNOW FACILITIES MATTER IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND STUDENT MOTIVATION I THINK SCHOOL FACILITIES SET THE TONE FOR THE SCHOOL DAY. WHEN A STUDENT WALKS ONTO A CLEAN AND APPROPRIATE SCHOOL FACILITY AGAIN IT SETS THE TONE FOR THE SCHOOL DAY. IN ADDITION TO THE BASIC PROGRAMS NEW CONSTRUCTION MODERNIZATION CT AND CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS BILL ADDRESSES MORE RECENT NEEDS INCLUDING DISASTER ASSISTANCE. TESTING AND REMEDIATION OF LEAD IN WATER REPLACEMENT OF SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD BUILDINGS AND- SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSISTANCE. THE BILL ALSO EXPANDS THE USE OF BOND FUNDS TO INCLUDE TECHNOLOGY REQUIRED TO ENSURE ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERNET AND OTHER FACILITIES A SCHOOL SUCH AS LIBRARIES PRESCHOOLS IN KITCHENS. THIS BILL ADDRESSES EQUITY BY PROVIDING MORE FUNDS TO DISTRICTS THAT MAY HAVE A HARDER TIME RAISING LOCAL FUNDS AND ENROLL A GREATER NUMBER OF LOW INCOME FOSTER CARE. AN ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS. AS YOU ALL PROBABLY KNOW THE LAST ONE REPLACED ON THE BALLOT PROPOSITION THIRTEEN WAS NOT APPROVED BY THE VOTERS. THIS BILL IS NOT IDENTICAL TO PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO MODIFY THE PROPOSAL TO GET VOTER SUPPORT WE HEARD THEM WE HEAR THEM- TESTIFYING BY BY PHONE ARE- FLOOR PRESTON WITH A CALIFORNIA AT THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. AND TIM TAYLOR WITH A SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION BEFORE I GO TO THE WITNESSES MR CHURCH WANT TO CLARIFY THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST ONE. WE PUT ON THE BALLOT HOW WILL IT BE DIFFERENT WILL FIRST OF ALL IT WILL NOT BE CALLED PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. OKAY I WILL NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN IS THAT CREATED A SIGNIFICANT. AMOUNT OF VOTER CONFUSION I HAD MY NEIGHBORS COMING TO ME SAYING OH DONALD HE WANT REVERSE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. THAT WAS NOT THE CASE THIS IS A SCHOOL BOND. THEY JUST HAPPEN TO FALL IN LINE WITH THE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN SO IF YOU HEARD ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS MIGHT WELL MAYBE FORTY YEARS YOU MIGHT HAVE THAT SAME PROBLEM. THE WATCH WORD ABOUT HAPPEN AGAIN. OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT AYE AYE I SUSPECT WILL BE MUCH LOWER MUCH LOWER- THE DEVELOPER. THE ASSESSMENT CHARGES WHERE WE'RE NOT MESSING WITH THOSE OF BUT THE GUARD THE PROPERTY VALUATION BASIS- WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE BINDING CAPACITIES OF LOCAL DISTRICTS THAT CREATED SOME CONCERN. LAST TIME WE DON'T WANNA DO THAT THIS TIME AROUND- HI RICH. IS NOT IN THIS BAR WELL. WELL WE FIND THAT THROUGH RESEARCH THAT NOT AS MANY VOTERS QUITE FRANKLY SUPPORT. BONDS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION DAY BUT THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT MADE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. THAT TO ADDRESS THE FACILITY NEEDS OF HIGHER EDUCATION MEANING. US THE CSU AND UC. THEM BECAUSE OUR IN THIS BOND EVER. BUT I WHAT WE DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN IS COMMIT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. TO EACH HIGHER- TO EACH OF THE HIGHER. EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS CSU AND UC TO UNDER MILLION DOLLARS FOR THEIR FACILITY NEEDS. AND ALLOW THEM TO SELF ON. SO THEY REALLY DON'T. NEED THIS MONTH AND I DON'T WANT TO BREAK THAT AGREEMENT WE WOULDN'T WANT TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM BY PUTTING THAT PERSON INTO THIS BOND- SO I BELIEVE THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN MADE HALL THAT'S WHY THEY- ARE NOT. IN THIS BOND GOODNESS BOND DIFFERENT THERE'S NOT A DOLLAR AMOUNT TODAY. BUT I SUSPECT WE'LL COME UP WITH THE DOLLAR AMOUNT SHORTLY AND IT WILL NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE LAST BOND I'M VERY CONFIDENT OF THAT. A WITH THAT WE DO HAVE THE WITNESSES ON THE PHONE- MISTER CHAIR.
