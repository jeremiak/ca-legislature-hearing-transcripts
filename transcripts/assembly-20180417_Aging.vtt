COMMUNICATIVE FAULT WE GET THE

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOLUTION. BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN

00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:57.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE CASE I'M WITH DIGNITY HEALTH

00:50:57.954 --> 00:50:58.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I'M ALSO WELL CONNECTED TO

ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN.

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:06.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN A TWO YEAR CONTRACT TO TRY

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND THEY

00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:09.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO SO AND

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:11.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE JUST RESIGNED A SECOND TWO

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:13.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YEAR CONTRACT. HOPING THAT

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:15.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERHAPS WE CAN SAVE THE PROGRAM

00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:17.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE LOSE CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:20.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOBODY CAN AFFORD TO COVER THAT

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:22.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOR US ANYMORE AND MET IN ITS

00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:23.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SIMPLY BECAUSE MEDICARE'S

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:24.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REIMBURSEMENT RATE DOESN'T COVER

THE COST.

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:27.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF WE COULD EXPAND OUR PROGRAM

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:28.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO SERVE A HUNDRED PEOPLE A DAY

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:30.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE WOULD BREAK EVEN THAT'S ALL

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IF THERE'S A MOVE OUT AGAIN

01:27:15.463 --> 01:27:16.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF

NEGOTIATION BETWEEN FACILITIES

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:20.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

WITH A LEGISLATION.

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO IN CLOSING WHAT I'D SAY IS I

ENOUGH SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY

01:58:11.417 --> 01:58:12.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHEN THERE'S VERY LITTLE

01:58:12.351 --> 01:58:13.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT SO I IS

01:58:13.519 --> 01:58:14.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE A WAY TO TIGHTEN THIS UP

01:58:14.687 --> 01:58:16.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING

IT'S ABOUT NARROWING THE SCOPE

02:00:50.343 --> 02:00:51.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE BACK

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:52.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE AMOUNT OF FRAUD. THAT OCCURS

02:03:52.191 --> 02:03:53.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH SENIORS BUT I THINK THAT

02:03:53.692 --> 02:03:58.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIS IS REALLY TRY TO IDENTIFY A

02:03:58.230 --> 02:03:58.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
VERY NUANCED.

02:03:58.898 --> 02:04:00.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOCUS ON ON ONE ASPECT OF SENIOR

02:04:00.332 --> 02:04:01.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FRAUD WHICH IS CHALLENGING TO DO

02:04:01.267 --> 02:04:03.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GIVEN THE BUSINESS MODEL BUT I

02:04:03.803 --> 02:04:04.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT THAT'S A CONVERSATIONS

02:04:04.570 --> 02:04:06.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE'VE HAD. WE'VE HAD WITH THE

JUDICIARY KNACKS WHICH I SAID

02:04:12.545 --> 02:04:13.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO CERTAINLY SOMEBODY'S CAR

02:04:13.946 --> 02:04:15.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BY MEMBERS WOULD BE REQUIRED OF

02:04:15.648 --> 02:04:19.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FLOOD OF ME AND. OUR STAFF HERE

02:04:19.852 --> 02:04:21.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

AND IF WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW

02:04:59.091 --> 02:05:00.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KIND OF A MANDATE FOR TRACKING

02:05:00.926 --> 02:05:03.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRAINING OR. BLOOD LET'S FACE IT

SOME OF US YOU KNOW THAT ARE A

02:05:05.264 --> 02:05:06.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE CAN

02:05:06.765 --> 02:05:08.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FEED AS BY A LOT YOU KNOW IF

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:09.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PART TIME

02:05:09.435 --> 02:05:10.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WORKERS COLLEGE STUDENTS OR

02:05:10.803 --> 02:05:11.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE

02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:13.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXPERIENCE. AND THAT'S WHERE MY

02:05:13.205 --> 02:05:13.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
STRUGGLE IS.

02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:16.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
AS WELL AS AS.

02:05:16.909 --> 02:05:20.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE THE MANDATE PART OF IT.

02:05:20.145 --> 02:05:22.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:24.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVEN THOUGH OF WHEN WE MANDATE.

02:05:24.416 --> 02:05:26.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THERE'S A DOZEN.

02:05:26.151 --> 02:05:27.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IS THE

02:05:27.219 --> 02:05:28.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SCAMMERS IN THESE FIELDS ARE NOT

02:05:28.721 --> 02:05:30.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE SCAMMERS THAT THE SCAMMERS

02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:31.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED THE

02:05:31.557 --> 02:05:32.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCAMS JR SCAMMERS ARE STILL OUT

02:05:32.925 --> 02:05:35.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE IN. AND SO I SEE WHERE

02:05:35.327 --> 02:05:36.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS BUT I

02:05:36.896 --> 02:05:38.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DON'T SEE THE PROTECTION AND.

02:05:38.197 --> 02:05:39.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IF THE SCAMMERS ARE NOT BEING

02:05:39.531 --> 02:05:41.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
COCKED.

02:05:41.166 --> 02:05:42.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE WE HAVE NO ASSURANCES

02:05:42.668 --> 02:05:44.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT YOU CAN FIND THOSETHE

02:05:44.169 --> 02:05:46.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STORES OR WHOEVER IT IS FOR THE

02:05:46.138 --> 02:05:47.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRANSMITTAL BUTTOCK SCAMMERS ARE

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:50.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT. BEING CAUGHT AND AT THE END

02:05:50.342 --> 02:05:51.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THE SCAMMERS STILL GOT THE

02:05:51.243 --> 02:05:53.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SCAM AND THEN HERE YOU KNOW WE

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:54.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MIGHT HAVE A SOMEBODY THAT'S

02:05:54.647 --> 02:05:57.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOSING THEIR JOB BECAUSE. OF NOT

02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:59.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CATCHING THAT SO THAT'S WHY I'M

02:05:59.451 --> 02:06:00.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STRUGGLING WITH THAT AND SO.

02:06:00.953 --> 02:06:02.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS WILL DEFINITELY TRYING TO%

02:06:02.821 --> 02:06:04.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FIRST THE FIRST STEP IS TO

02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:05.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
REPORT THE CRIME.

02:06:05.858 --> 02:06:07.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEN THE HOPEFULLY THE LAW

02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:10.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ENFORCEMENT WOULD DO DARE THE TO

02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DILIGENT TO CATCH TO SING

02:06:10.763 --> 02:06:12.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SCAMMERS.

02:06:12.665 --> 02:06:14.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO THIS ONE WAS JUST RECALL OF A

02:06:14.533 --> 02:06:18.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM LYING. TO. TO PUT DECIMAL
