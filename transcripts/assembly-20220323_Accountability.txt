GOOD MORNING OF NOVEMBER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. WHAT COLLEGE COULD BORI MY PLEASURE TODAY TO PRESENT TO YOU A BE NINETEEN NINETY SIX. WHICH I AM. I AM ACTUALLY THRILLED TO PRESENT TODAY. ALTHOUGH I'VE HAD I DO KNOW THE BILL HAS DRAWN SOME OPPOSITION BUT I ACTUALLY THINK. HONESTLY I'VE I'VE IS WITH MY- COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS CONVERSATION. AND I BELIEVE THIS IS A SORT OF BILL THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE PASSING BY ACCLAMATION. AND I DEFINITELY DO NOT THINK FOR A LOT OF REASONS. THAT TO ASK STATE AGENCIES. ONE TIME TO LOOK BASS BACK ACROSS THE THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOURTEEN THOUSAND PAGES OF REGULATIONS AND CONSIDER WHETHER SOMETHING IN THEIR IN THEIR BAILIWICK MAYBE OUTDATED INCONSISTENT DUPLICATIVE. IS ASTONISHING. WE ARE HOWEVER THE ONE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THAT CONSTANTLY RENEWS ITSELF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH CONTINUES THE COURTS CONTINUE BUT OUR BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT EVERY TWO YEARS WE RENEW OURSELVES. AND AS A PART OF THAT WE STAND DURING THE CHAMBERS. WE STAND UP IN YOUR WHICH ARE COUNTY IS CALLED. AND WE TAKE THAT BASE THAT MOST VULNERABLE. I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR TO SUPPORT. ATTORNEY TALK ABOUT DEFENDING SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION. AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE BASIC IN THE CONSTITUTION AND THAT WE ARE THE REPRESENT A BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THIS BILL FOR A NUMBER OF TIMES CAN WE LOOK AROUND THE GLOBE AND NOT FEEL DEMOCRACY IS THREATENED THE DEEP DIVISIONS THAT EXIST. SO HOW DO WE HAVING TAKEN THAT'LL- CONCEIVABLE WAY TO TELL PEOPLE IN OUR STATE THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS NOT BROKEN. THAT THERE IS A PATH IN THE STATE CAPITAL THAT THE SYSTEM IS OPEN TO PEOPLE. THEY WANT THE WINDOW OPEN LET THE BREEZE BLOW. YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT CANNOT LIVE BY THE CREDO. COME WE'LL OR WILL OUR STATUS IS QUO. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE CAN BE ABOUT. IT'S NOT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE ABOUT. TO MY CORE I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS REASONABLE IF I WOULD SAY IF THERE IS A ONE MAN- I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT. IT UP THIS BILL SAYS EVERY AGENCIES SHALL LOOK BACK FOR THE SNOW CLASS OF A- REGULATIONS OUTDATED DUPLICATIVE INCONSISTENT. THEY WILL HOLD A HEARING AND LET THE PEOPLE COMMENT ON THAT SO THEY'RE OPEN THE DOOR LED TO R. PARTIS POURED PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY PARTICIPATE. THEY'RE GONNA RICHARD REPORT THE LEGISLATURE TO THE RELEVANT STANDING COMMITTEES INFORMING THEM OF SUGGESTED CHANGES. THERE'S A THIRTY DAY WINDOW ON THAT REPORT BEFORE THEY CAN ACT. WE MIGHT SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE LONGER THAN THIRTY DAYS. IT WAS DONE THE BOOK FOR TEN YEARS I WOULD THINK THERE'S SOME INCONSISTENCY ONE A LOT OF THE SIXTIES WHEN A LOT OF THE NINETY DAYS SO THE COMMITTEES CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS ON THAT. AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE A STAKE IN WHETHER THAT'S A RIGHT CALL THE SCRIPT READERS MIGHT BE. A COULD WEIGH IN. BUT THE LEGISLATURE RESPONSE- BUT I DEFINITELY FEEL THAT THIS BILL. I THINK IT MEETS A NEED IN OUR ERA. YOU KNOW I WE ALL THANK YOU ALL OF THE- BECAUSE HAD BY SIXTY NINTH BIRTHDAY ON FRIDAY. I TELL MY STAFF- MOLDS DIRT- I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS EIGHT WRITE IN A LETTER TO THE JFK WHITE HOUSE I GOT A LETTER BACK. SOME SERVER THAT CAMELOT GENERATION. YOU KNOW WHAT AND EXCITEMENT. DID WAS CREATED FROM THAT PRESIDENTIAL RACE. AND THEN BEFORE I WAS ELECTED OFFICIAL LIKE. LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE I TOOK MY FIRST OF OFFICES CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. I GOT A LETTER FROM ANOTHER KENNEDY. THIS ONE U. S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE TONY KENNEDY. WHO WROTE ME A LETTER AND HE SAID THE FOLLOWING. CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND ALL OF YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR WORKING TO RE INVIGORATE THE PRINCIPLE. A PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY. SELF GOVERNMENT LET'S NOT BE AN ABSTRACT IDEAL BUT MUST BE A REALITY. AND WE MUST BE UNCEASING AND OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE AND RESPECTED BY OUR PEOPLE. COLLEAGUES I LOOK AT THIS BILL JUST SAYS A ONE TIME LOOK. FOR THINGS OF A VERY NARROW CLASS. TO SEE IF THEY MIGHT BE UPDATED. TO MORE FOR. ACCURATELY REFLECT THE HOW THE WHOLE SYSTEM WORK THIS TO ME IS JUST A STRATEGY FOR THE LEGISLATURE THIS CONTINUALLY RENEWING INSTITUTION TO TAKE A STEP TO MAKE OUR PARTIS PORTABLE DEMOCRACY MORE RESPECTED. I REALLY THINK WE ARE IN AN ERA. WHEN EVERY LAWMAKER EVERY PUBLIC OFFICIAL REALLY HAS TO CONCENTRATE ON HOW DO WE MAKE OUR SYSTEMS ARE INTERESTED GOVERNMENT MORE RESPECTED. BY OUR PEOPLE. AND- SO AS I SAY THIS BILL REQUIRES THE STATE IS TO REVIEW ALL OF ITS REGULATIONS AND DIGNIFIED REVISED IN THE THAT ARE DUPLICATIVE OVERLAPPING INCONSISTENT RUN DATE. THERE'S A TIMELINE FOR THIS THANK JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY SIX. I DO I WELL KNOW THAT THE OFFICE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REQUIRES A REVIEW AT THE OUTSET. I WENT TO WORK IN THE BILL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN RIGHT AFTER OIL HAVE BEEN SET UP IT WAS THAT IT WAS A- KEY KEYSTONE OF SPEAKER LOW MCCARTHY'S CAREER. THAT'S WHY WOULD I GO BACK TO THAT DAY. AW THIS ISONE THAT IS MORE AS I SAY IT'S FOCUSED ON THE PASSAGE OF TIME. AND AS I SAY I TO OUR INSTITUTION. DEALS WITH THAT SO MANY OF OUR BILLS ARE KIND OF LOOKING STATUTES- SO I DO THINK IT'S SUPPORTS ACCOUNTABILITY BUT REALLY I THINK IT'S- A DAUNTING TIME PASSES THINGS CHANGE. PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL OUR SYSTEM GOVERNOR'S RESPONSIVE I THINK THIS IS. IT IS NOT A HEAVY LEFT IT HAS BEEN RAISED BY SOME OF THE CRITICS OF. ALL MY ALL MY GOSH THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE TIME AND RESOURCES TO DO THIS REVIEW. AND SO IT SORT OF BECOMES A QUESTION IS THAT THE RIGHT. USE OF TIME NOW THERE'S ACTUALLY A FAIR QUESTION. RESOURCE ALLOCATION ISSUES ARE ALWAYS IMPORTANT. BUT DOING IT THROUGH THE LENS OF DEMOCRACY AND HOW WE STRENGTHEN AND HOW WE ESTABLISHED THAT WE ARE. FULL ON PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY I THINK THIS ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE FOR YEARS TO GET THROUGH IT IS NOT TOO GREAT A BURDEN ACTUALLY THEY GIVE ACTUALLY REBALANCES THE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT'S GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY. ON SO THAT IS- MY PRESENTATION- I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE IS THAT PROVISION. WHICH GREW OUT OF MY CONVERSATIONS OF LABOR ON THIS BILL YEARS AGO BUT I WILL READ INTO THE RECORD. THAT SAYS. THIS CHAPTER SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO WEAKEN OR UNDERMINE THE SECTION ELEVEN THREE SIXTY SIX POINT FOUR FIVE. ON PAGE FOR THE BILL THIS CHAPTER SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO WEAKEN OR UNDERMINE IN ANY MANNER IN HUMAN HEALTH PUBLIC OR WORKER RIGHTS PUBLIC WELFARE ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHER PROTECTIONIST ABSENT A STATUTE. THIS CHAPTER SHOPPING CONSTRUED AFFECT THE AUTHORITY OR REQUIREMENT FOR NATURE TO ADOPT REGULATIONS AS PROVIDED BY STATUTE. RATHER IT IS THE INTENT OF ALLEGED TO ENSURE THAT STATE AGENCIES FOCUS MORE FOR FIND DRUG UNDER DUTIES AS PRESCRIBED BY LOSS WAS TOO SCARCE PUBLIC DOLLARS FOR VIRTUALLY TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW WILL ACHIEVE EQUAL OR IMPROVED ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC BENEFITS. SO I. THAT OF COURSE WAS PUT THERE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT USING THIS REVIEW CHARACTER FROM REGULATION IS ACHIEVING A IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH OR OTHER PURPOSE. AND I ACTUALLY THAT'S A SALVATOR PROVISION THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A RIGHT THING. SO I DO KNOW I AM A POLICY ADVOCATE CALCHAMBER AND I'M OF COURSE VERY GRATEFUL FOR SUPPORT BUT THIS IS MY BILL. THIS IS A BILL THAT I DRAFTED IT'S NOT ONE THAT CAME FROM ANYONE ELSE YOUR FAX FOR MY OWN PERSONAL CONVICTIONS. AND- AND AS I SAY IF I THOUGHT WAS A GOOD IDEA IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED AS A B. TWELVE AND PASSED BY ACCLAMATION. I ACTUALLY FEEL MEETS AN EVEN MORE PRESSING NEED NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CLAY. I OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINE FOR- MISS HOFFMAN. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ACTUALLY HAWKS IN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT AND EIGHTY NINETEEN NINETY SIX MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSES ARE SMALL BUSINESS SAID AND MORE THAN 80% OF THEM HAD FEWER THAN TEN EMPLOYEES. THE SMALL BUSINESSES DO NOT HAVE THE SAME FINANCIAL ABILITY IS A LARGE BUSINESS TO RETAIN LEGAL COUNSEL ACCOUNTANT OR EMPLOYER ABOUT HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT I'VE TALKED TO MANY WHERE THE OWNERS THEMSELVES ARE THE ONES RUNNING PAYROLL AND BALANCING THE BOOKS IN ADDITION TO THEIR OTHER DUTIES. THESE LIMITED RESOURCES MAKE IT EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH CALIFORNIA'S EVER GROWING BODY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND HOW THOSE LAWS ARE BEING ENFORCED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO DENT MULTIPLE PAGE CONTENT HUNDREDS OF PAGES BONTA REGULATION AND THE LABOR CONTEXT THERE'S BEEN INSTANCES WHERE AN EIGHTEEN YEAR IS FOR CALIFORNIA TO UPDATE ITS OWN OUT OF EIGHT REGULATIONS TO CONFORM TO UPDATE SIMILAR FEDERAL REGULATION WHICH COULD GENERATE COMPLAINTS ISSUES AND CONFUSION. BY REQUIRING STATE AGENCIES TO PROACTIVELY CONDUCT A ONE TIME INTERNAL REPEAL SEVEN DENNIS HI INCONSISTENT OVERLAPPING ARE OUT OF STATE REGULATIONS THIS BILL WILL HELP OUR SMALL BUSINESS BETTER WHAT IS REQUIRED OF THEM THIS EXERCISE WOULD BE ESPECIALLY MEANINGFUL AT A TIME AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE GETTING BACK ON THEIR FEET AFTER SUFFERING HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DEVASTATION DURING CARPET. THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD TO ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS RUN BILLS TO REQUIRE AGENCIES TO UPDATE SPECIFIC REGULATIONS- IDENTIFIED INCONSISTENT POLICIES REGULATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS INDEED WARRANTED THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. IN THE URGENT I ABOUT. THANK YOU. I IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WISHING TO TEST AND. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS CHRISTMAS CEILIDH ON BEHALF OF TWO CLIENTS THE HOLLYWOOD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OPERATOR IS THERE ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINE WISHING TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE WILL GO TO LINE SEVENTEEN GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS DATE FOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CALLING IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. IRATE AT SO WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE TO OUR OUT WITNESSES WHO ARE PROVIDING TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION FIVE. LET'S SEE- DO WE HAVE FOLKS IN THE ROOM TODAY YES WE DO ALL RIGHT SO WE ARE FIVE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM MITCH STICKER- FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION MITCH STEIGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- AS WELL INTENTIONED AND SENSIBLE AS THE BILL MAY SOUND WE BELIEVE THAT. THIS BILL AS WRITTEN IN AFFECT WOULD BE SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. WE BELIEVE THAT BY FAR THE BIGGEST WEAKNESS IN OUR CURRENT REGULATORY STRUCTURE IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT TAKES. FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW WHEN IT COMES TO WORKER SAFETY STANDARDS IT TAKES ON AVERAGE SIX TO TEN YEARS OR MORE. FOR A NEW STANDARD TO TAKE A FACT AND WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS REQUIRE THOSE WERE DEVELOPING THOSE REGULATIONS TO ESSENTIALLY DROP WHAT THEY'RE DOING GO BACK THROUGH ALL OF THE EXISTING TITLE A RAGS. AND LOOK FOR OVERLAPPING OR DUPLICATIVE FOR AND CONSISTENT LANGUAGE AND WHAT THAT WOULD DO I MEAN WE ALREADY SEE. THAT CREATE A LOT OF DELAYS WHEN THEY HAVE TO DROP WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE BUT BY REQUIRING THEM TO GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE REGULATION THAT'S IN PLACE. IT WOULD OUT WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH TIME BUT IT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT WORKERS ALREADY WAIT FAR TOO LONG SUFFER INJURIES IN SOME CASES FATALITIES WHILE WAITING FOR THE STANDARDS TO TAKE A FACT. THIS BILL WOULD JUST EXTEND THAT AMOUNT OF TIME WE'RE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THAT. IN ADDITION PART OF THE REASON THAT IT TAKES SO LONG IS THAT THESE AGENCIES SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME OBSESSING OVER THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T ALREADY DUPLICATE EXISTING STANDARDS OR EXISTING REGULATORY LANGUAGE. AND SO BY REQUIRING THEM TO GO BACK THROUGH AND ESSENTIALLY DO THAT AGAIN IRONICALLY THIS BILL KIND OF CREATES THE EXACT PROBLEM IS TRYING TO SOLVE. AND THEN FINALLY PROBABLY OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT. A LOT OF REASONABLE MINDS DISAGREE OVER WHAT QUALIFIES AS INCONSISTENT OR DUPLICATIVE LANGUAGE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO WORKER SAFETY STANDARDS THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY ARGUES THAT. EVERY SINGLE NEW STANDARD THAT WE PETITION FOR OR SUPPORT DUPLICATES WHAT'S CALLED THE INJURY AND ILLNESS PREVENTION PROGRAM. EVERY SINGLE ONE THAT I'VE WORKED ON MY TIME CALIFORNIA THEY'VE MADE THIS ARGUMENT AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD STOP THEM FROM LITIGATING THIS QUESTION. WILL BE IN EFFECT. QALISYA DIDN'T AGREE AND IDENTIFY A VARIETY OF REGULATIONS AS BEING DUPLICATIVE FOR THE EMPLOYER COMMITTEES MADE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT THEY BELIEVE ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THESE NEW STANDARDS DUPLICATE THE IPP AND THAT'S JUST ONE AGENCY REALLY WITH ONE ISSUE AREA IT'S BOGGLES THE MIND TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE ACROSS ALL STATE AGENCIES SO. WE VERY MUCH DUE RESPECT INTENT WE THINK THE REALITY WOULD JUST MEAN GREATER DELAYS THE HER MORE WORKERS. AND A VARIETY OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGENT OVER WE HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL WITNESS- IN OPPOSITION. I BELIEVE ON THE OPERATOR CAN OPEN THE PHONE LINE FOR- MS LINDA SAID I'D LIKE WE. GOOD MORNING WHERE MEMBERS WENT AWAY WITH WESTERN CENTER AMMAN COPY YOU MUST UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSE AB NINETEEN NINETY SIX WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S GOLDBERG BELIEVES THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY AS MENTIONED THE EXISTING ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT ALREADY INCLUDES SEVERAL BASS PROCESS. TO ENSURE PROPOSED REGULATIONS ARE NECESSARY NOT DUPLICATE IT IN CLEAR MORE IMPORTANTLY THE ACT ENSURE A STRONG PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS BY PROVIDING STAKEHOLDERS AMPLE TIME AND NOTICE TO ENGAGE. AND-REQUIRING AGENCIES TO RESPOND TO PUBLIC COMMENT RATHER THAN DIVERTING RESOURCES WE WOULD RATHER STATE AGENCIES PROMULGATE REGULATIONS NOTING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH OVERSEES THE MEDICARE PROGRAM HAVE YET TO BEGIN THE PROCESS TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS. FOR CHANGES IN STATUTE OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO RATHER THAN ELIMINATING REGULATIONS WITH LIMITED PUBLIC INPUT PROCESS WE RECOMMEND PUSHING AGENCIES REGULATIONS DEADLINE BY IMPORTING STATE STATUTE. FINALLY WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE STATE AGENCY TEAM SEPARADO. TORY CADENCE. HELLO REVIEW AND IT'S NOT AS ROBERT AT THE PRODUCT. WOULD BE TO BE THINKING WE RESPECT OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I IS THERE ANYONE IN ROOM I WISH SHE CHIU. TESTIFY IN A- OKAY NINE OPERATORS ANYONE ON ON THE PHONE LINE TO IN OPPOSITION. IF ANYONE IS TEST IN A PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE DO HAVE A LINE CHEWED UP ONE MOMENT WHILE WE PROVIDE DEADLINE NUMBER. WE WILL GO TO LINE TWELVE GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MAKERS FLANK THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION OR AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB NINETEEN NINETY SIX THANK YOU. SURE WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I WILL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR LACKEY. YEAH I JUST REAL BRIEFLY WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT YOU'RE OPENING PRESENTATION WAS JUST MISSING PATRIOTIC MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND WAS A SO WELL STATED- I CAN TELL YOU THAT- YEAH YOU. YOUR WISDOM IS GREATLY APPRECIATED AS REFLECTED IN THIS BILL AND PROUD TO SUPPORT. MISTER K. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THANK YOUR SQUADRONS BEFORE I THINK IT HAS A LOT OF MERIT- ALTHOUGH I DID THINK THE TESTIMONY FROM THE GENTLEMAN FROM LABOR SHED- BROUGHT UP SOME GOOD ISSUES MOST NOTABLY IN MY MIND- BECAUSE THE RESOURCES ISSUE RIGHT TO OFTEN THE AGENCIES THAT WE PUT IN CHARGE OF OVERSIGHT ESSENTIALLY ORDER OR REGULATION- ARE UNDERFUNDED AND IN FACT THIS LEGISLATURES PASSED SOME PRETTY HORRIFIC BILLS THAT TURNED THE OVERSIGHT OF STATE GOVERNMENT AND SOME OF THESE YOUR WORKER PROTECTIONS ARE THINGS OVER THE COURTS. RIGHT WHAT WE TEND TO INCOMING OVERLY LITIGIOUS SOCIETY WHERE WE TEND TO- LITIGATORS PROBLEMS WITH THE EXCUSE ALL WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES WELL IN THE LAST. GOSH I DON'T KNOW FOR FIVE YEARS NOW I AM HAVING A HARD TIME REMEMBER NEW YEAR WE DIDN'T HAVE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS IT. MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS TO HELP ME OUT. SO TO ME. THE RIGHT WAY FORWARD HERE AND I KNOW THE LABOR FED. REPRESENTATIVE WONDERED IN THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE OFTEN SAY HEY WE GOT A WORK IN PROGRESS BILL HERE WE NEED TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS. MAYBE WE NEED TO ENGAGE SOME. PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE FOLKS AT THE LABOR FED- SO THAT WE COULD GET INTO THE RESOURCES ISSUE BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW ONE. ELIMINATES THE OPTION FOR THE OTHER RIGHT HAVING THE ABILITY GO BACK AND LOOK AT TO PLAY COULD HAVE A REGULATIONS DEAL WITH US WHILE THAT MIGHT TAKE MORE RESOURCES WE STILL NEED THE UMPIRES ON THE FIELD GREAT POINT LET'S MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE ROUTE. IS A TO DO THAT WORK AND I'M SURE- THE LABOUR FED IN YOUR OFFICE TO PERHAPS GET TOGETHER WORK ON SOME AMENDMENTS OR OR SOME PROPOSALS FOR THE NEXT COMMITTEE HEARINGS WHERE WE COULD GET THE MONEY AND THEY COULD BECOME CHAMPIONS OF THIS EFFORT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE MONEY BOTH TO DO OUR CURRENT JOB. ABOUT ALSO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO LOOK AT A JUDGE DUPLICATIVE. REGULATIONS THAT MAKES LESS SENSE TO ME SO I'M CURIOUS IF YOU'D BE OPEN TO MAYBE HAVE SOME MEETINGS WITH THEM AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE ALL MOVE IN A DIRECTION THAT'S PRODUCTIVE AND DON'T LET. TO- YOU KNOW TO POSITIVE CONCEPTS- DIE. BECAUSE OF A LACK OF COOPERATION WHAT DO YOU THINK YEAH. WELL I THINK MOST MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT IF YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING YOU PUT MONEY BEHIND. STRUCTURE THAT THAT IS A RIGHT SORT OF MESSAGE TO BE SENDING. IT THAT SAYS IT IS A PRIORITY ON. I THINK THE- IN THEIR PROCESS I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY OF COURSES BILL JUST FOCUS ON DUPLICATIVE INCONSISTENT OUTDATED. AHA ACTUALLY THAT'LL END UP BEING AN ERROR CLASS OF THINGS BUT I. THE IDEA OF KIND OF PROVIDING SOME FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE PROCESS I THINK IS GOOD I ALSO WANNA NOTE AGAIN THIS PROVISION IT. AGENCIES AS HE IDENTIFIED THE SORTS OF ISSUES OUR FIRST REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON WHAT THE CEASE AND THAT WOULD GO TO THE STANDING COMMITTEE SO. I'VE ALREADY SUGGEST I THINK. AS DRAFTED THE BILL PROVIDES THAT THEY PROVIDE A THIRTY DAY NOTICE. AND I ACTUALLY THINK. LISTING TO THEM TO HAVE IT ILLEGIBLE MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS ALLOWS A LITTLE MORE CONVERSATION TO HAPPEN AND PEOPLE LOOK OVER THE SHOULDER AGAIN OF THE OF THE AGENCY ARE THEY GOING DOWN THE RIGHT TRAIL DO WE AGREE WITH THAT SO I'M ACTUALLY RECEPTIVE ON THE FUNDING SIDE I THINK THAT ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT THERE BE. IT IS A PRIORITY AND I ALSO THINK THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED NOW IT WOULD DOVETAIL WITH THAT. PRESSURE THE PRESSURE THAT WOULD LOVE A FEW A FEW OFFICE KEEP ME UPDATED ON. KIND OF THE STATUS OF DISCUSSIONS IN THE LAST LABOUR FED- I WILL BRING YOU UP HERE AGAIN BUT- IF YOU CAN KEEP ME POSTED ON YOUR PARTICIPATION AS WELL. THANK YOU WELL I MR COOLEY YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN I WAS A NEWLY ELECTED MEMBER JERRY I THINK PROBABLY MY FIRST HEARING OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I REMEMBER LOOKING BACK THROUGH THE HISTORY OF IT THIS PROPOSAL AND I THINK I PROBABLY SAID IN THE HEARING I WAS COMPLETELY CONFOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT. IT HAD FAILED SO MANY TIMES TO MOVE THROUGH OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND BE ENACTED INTO LAW AND I THINK LOOKING BACK AND IF YOU KNOW THREE YEARS ON TO MY TIME THE LEGISLATURE I FEEL THAT A MEASURE LIKE THIS IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS AS A NEW MEMBER IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND I THINK FOR ME WANT ONE EXAMPLE THAT I DO WANT TO SHARE BECAUSE IT WAS AN AREA THAT THIS COMMITTEE I SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND ATTENTION ON AND- ALSO AN ISSUE THAT WAS. WIDELY IN THE NEWS THAT'S RELATED TO YOU CALIFORNIA'S EDT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ANDFOR ME THAT DEPARTMENT JUST TYPIFIES WHY SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. AND WHY. APPLE THIS HAS A REAL IMPLICATIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS SO. AS WE CONDUCT OUR OVERSIGHT HEARINGS INTO E. D. D. WE LEARNED THAT EDIE'S TRAINING MANUAL. IS AN EIGHT HUNDRED. EIGHT HUNDRED PAGE PAPER DOCUMENTS. AND I'M SORRY BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME THAT IN THAT EIGHT HUNDRED PAGE PAPER DOCUMENT THERE IS NOT HECK OF A LOT OF. AMAZING THAT WOULD OUTDATED REDUNDANT AND DUPLICATIVE LEGISLATION WHICH IS WHY IT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT. FOR OUR HARD WORKING EMPLOYEES AT ET DE. TAKE GET THEIR JOB DONE AND GET MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT EIGHT HUNDRED PAGE MANUAL ALSO SAYS IT SPEAKS TO A OUTDATED LEGACY TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WHICH GUESS WHAT. WE'RE SPENDING LESS TIME AND ENERGY ON OUT AIDED IN DUPLICATIVE REGULATIONS WE'VE GOT MORE TIME ENERGY AND MONEY. TO FIX THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY ISSUESI'M AND THEN THE LAST POINT I WANT TO PICK UP BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU AS MR LACKEY NOTED DURING YOUR OPENING WAS WAS VERY POWERFUL. AND YOU MADE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SPELL TO ADDRESS. OUTDATED I DUPLICATE EVERY TENDONS REGULATIONS TO THE STREET. TO MARK SAY. AND I THINK THAT SOMETIMES YOU KNOW. THAT'S A CONNECTION THOSE ARE OTS PEOPLE DO NOT ALWAYS CAN ACT BUT- I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN A AND WHERE. I PEOPLE'S FAITH IN GOVERNMENT. THAT SOMETHING OF AN ALL TIME LOW AND THAT IS WHY I THINK THAT THE ROLE OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER BECAUSE EVERY TIME THERE'S A STORY. ABOUT WASTE FRAUD OR ABUSE IT OF REDS THE PUBLIC'S TRUST FURTHER AND- IT IS IMPERATIVE IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR ALL OF US TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO RESTORE PEOPLE'S FAITH IN GOVERNMENT. AND DELIVER FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SO WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST TAKE THE PROVISION BEING HERE RIGHT I THANK THIS COMMITTEE I. SO DEEPLY BELIEVE IN OVERSIGHT. AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE EVERYBODY DOES OVERSIGHT BUT SO OFTEN BIG DOLLAR ISSUES GET REVIEWED IN THIS COMMITTEE IT PLAYS A VERY VITAL ROLE IN HOW OUR GOVERNMENT WORKS SO OFTEN IN THE TECHNOLOGY AREA. THERE'S SO MUCH OVERSIGHT TO GETS DONE HERE BUT- I DO BELIEVE THIS IDEA I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE VERY FINE ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED. I SAID IN MY REMARKS IN TWENTY ELEVEN CENTER FRAN PAVLEY HAD THIS IDEA IN A BILL. AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT- IN THE COMMENTS ON THE BILL IS STATED THE APPROACH IN THIS BILL IS IN LINE WITH A RECOMMENDATION. FROM THE TWENTY ELEVEN LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT BETTER REGULATION IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S RULE MAKING PROCESS WHICH STATES THAT THE STATE SHOULD CREATE A LOOK BACK MECHANISM. TO DETERMINE WHETHER REGULATIONS ARE STILL NEEDED AND WHETHER THEY WORK. SO I THINK THAT'S SORT OF IN. A LOOK BACK MECHANISM MR- GRAYSON WAS LIKE SOMETHING WOULD HAVE SOME FUNDED WITH SO- I THINK. I WILL CONCLUDE I THINK THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING HERE. AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO SAY. MY COLLEAGUES ON THE SIDE WHO ARE WHO TODAY ARE NOT STATE IN SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. NONE THE LESS ARE PART OF OUR PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY I WILL LOOK FORWARD WITH WORKING WITH THEM. AND- BUT IN THE DAY I FEEL MY JOB IS TO BE A CHAMPION FOR THE PEOPLE AND FOR. THIS INSTITUTION WHICH IS. AS I SAY ONE WHICH RENEWS ITSELF AND I THINK THIS IS PART. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I. DO WE HAVE A MOTION. MOVE ALL RIGHT AND THE SECOND.

THANK YOU. I AND LET'S SEE WHAT YOU HAVE ONE- PERSON ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY AND THAT'S VICKY DAWLEY WILL. WITH THE TAME A COUNTY RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT RIGHT I OPERATOR KEY PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR- IS DOLLY. THIS ALWAYS GOING TO BE OPEN. GOOD MORNING THANKS FOR HAVING ME- THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT OF TEHAMA COUNTY MANAGES ABOUT FIFTY PROJECTS THAT RANGE FROM FOUR STRAIGHT EDUCATION ACT OUR CULTURE WE ARE SOLD THE GRANT FUNDED LIKE THE MAJORITY OF OUR CITIES ACROSS THE STATE. IT'S LEADERS DEPENDING ON REIMBURSABLE GRANTS WHICH MEANS THAT WE SPEND THE MONEY AND THEN WE GET PREPARED FOR THE WORK IF THAT REPAYMENT IS SLOW IT CAN CAUSE SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. ON MANY OCCASIONS WE'VE HAD TO WAIT SIX MONTHS FOR PAYMENT AND THREE MONTHS IS A STANDARD PAYMENT SCHEDULE. WHERE ARE STATE CONTRACT UNLIKE THE FORTY FIVE DAY PAYMENT SCHEDULE THAT IS WRITTEN IN ALL OF OUR STATE CONTRACTS THAT FORTY FIVE DAY PAYMENT SCHEDULES RARELY MATH. DURING THE BOND FREEZE OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAD TO LAY OFF 5850% OF OUR STAFF WHILE WE WAITED FOR THE STATE TO START. PAYING US AGAIN AND- WHEN AGENCIES WERE CONVERTING TO CRISCO WE WENT FOR TWO MONTHS WITH NO PAYMENTS WHATSOEVER AND WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO HAVING TO LAY OFF STAFF AGAIN AND THAT WAS. JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WE HAVE A STAFF OF TWENTY AND EQUIPMENT THE CONDUCTOR FIELD WORK WHICH INCLUDES PICKUP TRUCKS TO CHIPPERS TO MASTICATING HERS. AND IT'S SORT OF SMALL EQUIPMENT AND TOOLS. SOME OF OUR PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE HAMMOCK COUNTY ARE- PROVIDING DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND HOMES. THE ELDERLY LOW INCOME AND DISABLED CITIZENS. BUILDING ROADSIDE FUEL BREAKS PROVIDING FREE IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY EVALUATIONS TO GROWERS IN THE GRAND BE TO HIM AND SHASTA COUNTIES. IN CONSTRUCTING SIDE CHANNELS FOR WINTER RUN SALMON HABITAT INCLUDING THE LARGEST BY CHANNEL SACRAMENTO RIVER. SO YOU CAN SEE WE PROVIDE A LOT OF SERVICES AND- A LOT OF. VARIETY ALL THE GRANT FROM THE ORGANISED IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET LINES OF CREDIT. WHICH WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM OF SMALL PAY BANKS ARE RELUCTANT TO OFFER LINES OF CREDIT ORGANIZATIONS WHO OFTEN HAVE NO ASSETS AND INCOME STREAM THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT. APPLE WE TRIED TO INCREASE OUR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LINE OF CREDIT WHEN OUR ANNUAL BUDGET WITH A MILLION DOLLARS BUT WITHOUT A GUARANTEED INCOME. NONE OF THE FOUR BANKS WE CAN HELP AND WAS WILLING TO FUND IT. TO PROTECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OWN PAYROLL ANY AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITH SUBCONTRACTORS INCLUDE A PROVISION OF THE SUBCONTRACTOR DOESN'T GET PAID UNTIL THE RCD GETS PAID. THIS LEAVES MALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN A DIFFICULT POSITION AS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PAYROLL AND SUBCONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS AND IT MEANS THAT SOME CONTRACTORS CANNOT AND WILL NOT AFFORD TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE RCD. WE FOUND THAT SOME STATE AGENCIES ARE MORE RELIABLE YOUR ABILITY TO PAY AND I AM THE MATTER WE AND POTENTIAL BIDDERS ARE PROJECTS ARE RELUCTANT TO WORK WITH THOSE THAT WE KNOW ARE SLOW PAYERS. ALTHOUGH STATE AGENCIES OF ALL CONVERTED TO FISCAL NOW THE STATE HAS REACHED A SOLUTION FOR PAYING OUT FUNDING FROM BONDS. THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE BOUNDARIES PROBLEM. AND SEVERAL AGENCIES ARE NOW ALLOWING ADVANCE IS NOT GRANT FUNDING. WE ARE CONTINUALLY AT RISK OF SOME NEW CATASTROPHE THAT WILL SLOW OR HALT THE PAYMENTS ON OUR STATE GRANTS.
