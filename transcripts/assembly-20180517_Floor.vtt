DEVELOPING THIS NATION.

01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:03.190 region:rollup2
THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM AND

01:41:01.556 --> 01:41:04.892 region:rollup2
LIBERTY AND JUSTICE ARE ROOTED

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:06.694 region:rollup2
IN THE AT OF THE MUSLIMS THAT WE

01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:08.362 region:rollup2
HAVE. AND WE SHOULD NEVER ALLOW

01:41:06.694 --> 01:41:11.165 region:rollup2

NATION IN RICHES OUR COMMUNITIES

01:41:26.581 --> 01:41:29.283 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE STRONGER AS A STATE

01:41:27.515 --> 01:41:30.518 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF IT.

01:41:29.283 --> 01:41:31.852 region:rollup2
IT IS INTERESTING THAT WHEN WE

01:41:30.518 --> 01:41:33.321 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT RELIGION WE OFTEN

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:35.222 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THE DIVISION THAT

01:41:33.321 --> 01:41:36.524 region:rollup2
EXIST BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS.

01:41:35.222 --> 01:41:37.725 region:rollup2
AND THERE BEEN WARS FOUGHT MORE

01:41:36.524 --> 01:41:39.126 region:rollup2
WARS FOUGHT ABOUT RELIGION THAN

01:41:37.725 --> 01:41:40.261 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ELSE.

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:41.395 region:rollup2
AND YET WHEN WE STUDY AND

01:41:40.261 --> 01:41:42.863 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLES OF

01:41:41.395 --> 01:41:43.931 region:rollup2
MOST RELIGIONS THEY'RE BASICALLY

01:41:42.863 --> 01:41:45.533 region:rollup2
THE SAME PRINCIPLES THAT MOST OF

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:47.501 region:rollup2
US BELIEVE THEM.

01:41:45.533 --> 01:41:49.337 region:rollup2
FAMILY LOVE THE COMMUNITY

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:50.171 region:rollup2

AND TRYING TO BUILD A BETTER

01:41:50.171 --> 01:41:53.441 region:rollup2
WORLD. AND YET WE SOMETIMES GET

01:41:52.106 --> 01:41:55.309 region:rollup2
CAUGHT UP IN THE DIVISION AND

01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:55.810 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCES RATHER THAN THE

01:41:55.309 --> 01:41:57.144 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT BIND US

01:41:55.810 --> 01:41:58.546 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

01:41:57.144 --> 01:42:00.047 region:rollup2

DEPEND ON SELF ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:44:27.962 --> 01:44:29.930 region:rollup2
AND THAT THERE IS NO SELF

01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:32.099 region:rollup2
WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY TO

RAMADAN REMINDS US THAT CERTAIN

01:44:48.682 --> 01:44:52.753 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS AND POWERS MAY TRY

01:44:50.784 --> 01:44:54.388 region:rollup2
TO CREATE DIVISIONS WITHIN OUR

01:44:52.753 --> 01:44:56.023 region:rollup2

01:44:54.388 --> 01:44:57.525 region:rollup2

PEACE EQUITY AND JUSTICE ARE THE

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:06.133 region:rollup2
SAME REGARDLESS OF OUR FAITH.

01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:08.702 region:rollup2

MAKE US STRONGER AS A STATE.

01:45:08.702 --> 01:45:13.908 region:rollup2
