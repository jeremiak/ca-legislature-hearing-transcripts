MAN IN NINETEEN NINETY- MANY

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:44.970
YEARS AGO NOW AND I REMEMBER MY

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.839
AUNT. WHO WAS AN OUT LESBIAN

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:48.240

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:19.939
WERE DYING ON MASS WITH VERY

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.807
LITTLE ATTENTION. FROM THE

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:23.309

BY THAT POINT IN TIME- IT WAS

00:12:36.822 --> 00:12:39.692
STILL CATEGORICALLY ILLEGAL- TO

00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:42.461

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:26.598
ABOUT A MORE SERIOUS ISSUE

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:29.334
WHICH IS THAT. AS MANY STRIDES

00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:30.536
WE'VE MADE AND THEY ARE

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:33.138
INCREDIBLE WE HAVE SO MANY

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:36.275
ELECTED LGBTQ PEOPLE WE'VE GOT

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:38.143

A- GUEST I DON'T WANT TO NAME

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:46.885
SO MANY BECAUSE IN OUR IN OUR

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:48.854
LEGISLATURE IN THE SENATE IN

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:50.455
THE U. S. IN THE CONGRESS IN

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.124
EVERY STATE HOUSE. SO IT'S

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.192
INCREDIBLE BUT HOMOPHOBIA STILL

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:57.362
REIGNS. MARCH IN OUR COUNTRY.

00:19:57.429 --> 00:20:00.065
AND IT'S LIKE SO MANY THINGS

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.967
IT'S MORE SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.068
WOMEN AND I'M NOT TRYING TO

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:05.671
MINIMIZE THE HOMOPHOBIA AGAINST

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:07.873
GAY MEN WERE AGAINST EVEN-

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.444
TRANSMISSION BUT WOMEN ARE THE

00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:13.579
TARGETS OF VIOLENCE. L. G B.

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:16.281
T. WOMEN AT MUCH HIGHER RATES.

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:18.483

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:23.889

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.958
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE OR STALKING

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:27.726
COMPARED 235% OF STRAIGHT

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:29.728
WOMEN. AND AMONGST THE TRANS

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:33.031

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:34.800
HAVE EXPERIENCED A VIOLENT

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:37.469
ASSAULTS SO THERE IS MUCH WORK

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:39.638
FOR US TO DO BUT AGAIN. I'M SO

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:41.340
PROUD OF THE STRIDES THAT WE

HAVE MADE. AND THAT I WOULD

00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:45.644
NEVER HAVE TO HOPEFULLY NO ONE

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:46.445

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:47.813
EXPERIENCE THAT I DID WHICH I

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:48.947

TALK ABOUT HER. LATER OF COURSE

00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:19.378

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:20.979
GAY AND WHEN I READ HER

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:22.914

WE ARE PAST THAT POINT AND

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:31.423

SOMETHING THAT IS PART OF A

00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:05.190
LARGER MOVEMENT WE THINK IT

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:06.458
JUST MIGHT BE A DIFFICULT

00:27:06.524 --> 00:27:08.660
SITUATION THAT WE FACED

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:12.097
OURSELVES AND MANY TIMES ALONE.

00:27:12.163 --> 00:27:13.698
AND MADE A DECISION IN THAT

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:15.700
CONTEXT THAT REALLY MADE A

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:19.070
DIFFERENCE IN ADDED WITH OTHERS

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:21.172

IN TO BUILD ON WHAT WAS SAID

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:25.577
EARLIER. AS ONE OF THE OLDER

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:27.912
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE WHEN I

00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:30.048

MANY SENATORS HAVE REFERENCE TO

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.834
STONEWALL INCIDENT AND YET IT

THAT DIDN'T THINK THEY HAD MUCH

00:27:58.043 --> 00:28:00.211
TO LOSE. THAT SORT OF STARTED

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:02.847
DOWN THE STREET OF STANDING UP

00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:06.017

SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND IN

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:21.466
NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHEN THEY

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:23.268
DID THAT THAT WAS A REMARKABLE.

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:25.103
FEELING OF FREEDOM OF NOT

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.404
LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER A

00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:28.173
FEELING YOU COULD BE CLEAR

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:30.475
ABOUT BEING YOURSELF. AND WHEN

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:31.876
THE FIRST MARCHES IN MY HOME

00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:34.512
TOWN HAPPENED IN THOSE YEARS.

00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:36.247
WE HAD MORE DEMONSTRATORS THAN

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:38.216
WE HAD MARCHERS WE HAD TO HIRE

00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:40.051
PRIVATE POLICE OFFICERS TO

00:28:40.118 --> 00:28:42.353
MARCH WITH US FOR OUR SAFETY

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.257
JUST MARCHING IN PUBLIC. DOWN

00:28:46.324 --> 00:28:48.960
THE STREET. IN IN ROOM. IN THIS

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:52.263
ROOM. WAS A DRAMATIC MOMENT IN

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.998
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THAT

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:56.768
REMOVED THE SODOMY LAW FROM

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.837
CALIFORNIA WAS DEADLOCKED HERE

00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:00.405
TWENTY TO TWENTY. BUT DEADLOCK

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:02.006
HAD TO BE HELD FOR HOURS FOR

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:03.541
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TO FLY

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:05.310
IN FROM OUT OF STATE TO CAST

00:29:05.376 --> 00:29:07.846
THE TIE VOTE. TO MAKE THAT

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:10.415
HAPPEN. AND FOR THOSE OF US

00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:12.750
THAT LIVED THROUGH. THE AIDS

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:14.486
CRISIS THERE CERTAIN PARTS OF

00:29:14.552 --> 00:29:16.421
IT THAT WERE REALLY PUBLIC BUT

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:17.822
AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS THE

00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:19.757
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF AN AIDS

00:29:19.824 --> 00:29:21.559
AGENCY AT THE HEIGHT OF THE

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:23.261
EPIDEMIC BEFORE THE DRUG

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:25.330
COCKTAIL THERE WERE CIVIL

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:27.031
RIGHTS ISSUES THAT HAPPENED

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:29.367
WITH IT I CAN'T TELL YOU THE

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:32.337
TIMES. THAT A FAMILY THAT WAS A

00:29:32.403 --> 00:29:34.706
STRANGE WOULD SWOOP INTO TOWN

00:29:34.772 --> 00:29:37.876
AND SWEEP UP HALF OF A HOUSE OR

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:40.044
WOULD GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.347
DENIED VISITING RIGHTS TO THE

00:29:42.413 --> 00:29:44.215
SPOUSE IN THE LAST DAYS OF

00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:47.619
SOMEBODY'S LIFE. JUST BECAUSE

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:50.822
THE RIGHTS MARK WHO RECOGNIZED

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:52.290
HIM I THINK THAT IT'S

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:55.093
INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HAVE BIG

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.461
DEBATES. ABOUT INCREMENTAL

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:59.230
CHANGE AND WHAT TO DO WHEN

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:00.765
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE

00:30:00.832 --> 00:30:02.667
SUPREME COURT ACTED IN VERMONT.

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:04.435
AND SAID THAT THEY HAD TO HAVE

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:06.437
DOMESTIC PARTNERS BENEFITS

00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:08.139
BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:09.908
THE QUALITY. AND VERMONT

00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:11.776
LEGISLATORS EVEN THOUGH IT WAS

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:12.977
UNDER ORDER FROM THE SUPREME

00:30:13.044 --> 00:30:16.114
COURT LOST THEIR SEATS IN THE

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:17.248
NEXT ELECTION FOR VOTING FOR

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:18.983
THAT. AND WITHIN A MATTER OF

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.186
YEARS DOMESTIC PARTNERS BECAME

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:23.054
THE CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINT.

00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:24.522
WITH REGARD TO MARRIAGE

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:27.225
EQUALITY. AND SO IT IS SO

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:29.794
IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY BE

00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:32.964

00:38:14.558 --> 00:38:16.627
PLAY AND SINCE BLACK MEN WERE

THE ONES DYING IT WASN'T

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:19.397
SOMETHING THAT THEY NEEDED TO

00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:22.800
WORRY ABOUT. IT WAS ONLY IN

00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:23.768
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WHEN

MARRY THE PERSON THEY LOVE AND

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:42.887

SAME THING AND I LIKE TO DO

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:43.968
THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A

TREAT THEIR CHILDREN WHEN THEY

00:41:51.842 --> 00:41:53.410
COME OUT TO THEM IT WAS REALLY

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:55.579
HEARTBREAKING TO ME AS A MOM OF

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:57.314
A DAUGHTER WHO IS GAY. TO SEE

00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:58.616
SOME OF HER FRIENDS WHO ARE GAY

00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:00.718
AND HOW THEY WERE TREATED THE

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:02.152
ONE THAT STRUCK ME THE MOST WAS

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:04.355

00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:06.357

THREE LANGUAGES IN HIGH SCHOOL

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:09.093
AND WHEN HE CAME OUT TO HIS

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:10.661
PARENTS THEY KICKED HIM OUT OF

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:11.896
THE HOUSE AND THEY DIDN'T

00:42:11.962 --> 00:42:14.331
WELCOMING BACK INTO THEIR HOME

00:42:14.398 --> 00:42:17.301
FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO AT THAT

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:18.168
TIME OUR DAUGHTERS WERE IN HIGH

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:20.504
SCHOOL. THANKS INKLING THAT

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:23.741
MAYBE- MAYBE JESSE WAS GAY AND

00:42:23.807 --> 00:42:24.775
SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE SHE FELT

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:26.477
REALLY WELCOME AND KNEW THAT

00:42:26.543 --> 00:42:27.544
SHE COULD TELL HER PARENTS

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:28.679
ANYTHING AND THAT WE WOULD

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:31.615
ALWAYS LOVE HER SO SIMILAR TO

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:32.883
MY COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND I

CONVERSATIONS I SAID YOU KNOW.

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:46.597
THE ONLY THING THAT WILL GET

00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:47.464
YOU KICKED OUT OF THE LABOR

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:49.600

DOUBT. SO THAT MADE ME FEEL
