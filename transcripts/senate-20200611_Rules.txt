BY THE WAY YOUR TIMING'S EVERYTHING IN POLITICS I JUSTIT'S JUST A GOOD BASS CITY TO ME THAT YOU CAME. RIGHT AT GROUND ZERO BUT YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH THIS IT IT'S IN AGAIN WE'RE FLYING BY SUPER PASS A LOT OF AREAS BUT SEEMS TO ME A LOT OF THIS SEEMS TO BE ARBITRARY. DECISIONS THAT IN MAY THAN ONE THIS SEEMS ARBITRARY TO ME AND TO MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS. IS WHEN GOVERNOR CAME OUT IN EARLY MAY AND SAID THAT THE FIRST A COMMUNITY SPREAD WAS AT A NAIL SALON. PEOPLE THAT GO TO THEIR LICENSURE PROCESS HAVE TO GO THROUGH HEALTH AND SAFETY THEY THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND NOW THIS IS A SOMETHING THAT STAGE FOR THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. AND I THINK WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT. THE ENTREPRENEURS IN THIS INDUSTRY- LARGELY IMMIGRANT MINORITY AND FEMALE OWNED AND IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN- ON ON ON THESE PEOPLE SO I'M JUST CURIOUS SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE IN TERMS OF THAT. AND WHAT IF ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO MAKE COMMANDS AND OR HELP- THESE THESE PEOPLE IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. THANK YOU SENATOR YOU ARE CORRECT I SHARE YOUR CONCERN THAT THE FINANCIAL STRAIN AND THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES THAT THE CALL WITH NINETEEN AB PANDEMIC HAS COST. NATIONALS AND LICENSEES ALL ACROSS THE STATE AND AS YOU MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY- ARE OUT AND BOARD AS I BARBERENA HAND AND COSMETOLOGY DAD REGULATE AND THEY'LL SHOPS AND BEAUTY SALONS HAS BEEN AN INDUSTRY IMPACTED- LIKE MANY OTHERS. I WANT TO REASSURE YOU THAT- OUR APPROACH HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO BE VERY COLLABORATIVE WITH- EVERY SINGLE INDUSTRY AND- THE VARIOUS- BUSINESSES THAT- ARE LICENSED THROUGH OUR DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AND WE YOU KNOW RECOGNIZE THAT. IN SOME CASES THERE HAS BEEN CONFUSION ABOUT WHEN- CERTAIN BUSINESSES KENO ARE ABLE TO OPEN OR NOT- OUR OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH. OUR PARTNERS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- TO DEVELOP YOUR GUIDANCE TO WORK THROUGH OUR BOARDS IN THE URALS TO COMMUNICATE TO LICENSEES. IN TWO AND FRANKLY TO BE AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE AND SO AS WE BEGAN TO. RE OPEN THE ECONOMY IS THIS YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A VERY THOUGHTFUL METHODICAL PROCESS TO DOING THAT. AND THAT WE ARE FULLY ENGAGE IN CONNECTICUT. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO. THAT IT IT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE WAY THAT ENABLES- SMALL BUSINESSES BEAUTY SALONS- IS OUT YOU KNOW THAT LICENSEE POPULATION THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING TO DO SO IN IN THE WAY THAT ENABLES THEM TO BE ABLE TO- TO RECOVER FROM THIS PANDEMIC.

THANK YOU- I HAVE A- MAYBE JUST A BRIEF QUESTION AND- AND IT'S SO GOOD TO GET A CHANCE TO TALK WITH YOU- GIVEN- THE WAY WE ARE HAVING TO WORK THESE DAYS AREN'T REMOTELY. YOU OVERSEE MANY OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO- TO SO MANY OF US HOUSING- OF FAIR HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT- HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SO MANY THINGS AND BY THE WAY. I WILL SAY- FROM MY DISTRICT PERSPECTIVE THEY DID WELL WITH- THE DEPARTMENT OF ACT OF BEVERAGE CONTROL ON A DAILY BASIS IN THE BALANCE THAT DEPARTMENT REALLY. CLOSE TO MEET ENTER PROVIDE BUSINESS LICENSES. INPUT IS DID PAUL BUT I HAVE TO SAY I EVEN YESTERDAY. I GET COMPLIMENTS ON THE STREET IN SACRAMENTO FROM SOME BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS FOR THAT DEPARTMENT SO I THOUGHT I WOULD PUBLICLY SHARE THAT. I QUESTIONS IN THE ROLE THAT WE PLAY HERE. AND AS THE RULES COMMITTEE TO CONFIRM APPOINTMENTS- MANY OF THOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE OUR APPOINTMENTS NOT REQUIRED TO APPEAR ON LIKE YOURS AS THE SECRETARY ARM AND SOMETIMES WITH THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. THERE ARE TIMES WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE TO HEAR THOSE APPOINTMENTS IT THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO APPEAR UNLESS THERE IS- COMPLAINTS MADE ABOUT THE WAY SOME OF THOSE BOARDS I INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC. SO I WAS HOPING TO GET YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PUBLIC PROTECTION ROLE OF THE CONSUMER THEIR DEPARTMENT AND KILLER HOW DO YOU BACK STAKEHOLDER IN THIS WHICH USUALLY HAS A LOT MORE RESOURCES MONEY LEGAL COUNSEL EXPERIENCE VERSUS SAY THE PUBLIC PROTECT. I THOSE WHO PROBABLY HAVE LESS RESOURCES INFLUENCE ARE IN THOSE CASES AND IF THERE IS A BALANCE. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THAT- THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT WILL CERTAINLY COME TO YOUR ATTENTION IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY THEY COME TO OUR ATTENTION FROM WE GET LETTERS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT UP. KILLER APPOINTMENTS TO SOME OF THOSE CONSUMER PROTECTION BOARD SO JUST A FEW MINUTES OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON THAT. DEPARTMENT IN PARTICULAR AND HOW YOU HOW YOU PERCEIVE THAT ROLE OF PUBLIC INTEREST. THANK YOU MADAM I HAVE AFTER TEN AND ADD TO THE CHAIR WOMAN AND I WILL ALSO PASS ALONG THE MESSAGE TO- JAKE UP IN ABC AND IT HAS ENTIRE TEAM IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SHARED IN TERMS OF THE POSITIVE COMMENTS. DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER FIRST I REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT- DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE AGENCY ARE JUST OVER THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES- RESPONSIBLE FOR- REGULATING AND SUPPORTING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS. ARE AND I- IT IT IS- A VERY SIGNIFICANT- DEPARTMENT- WITH- VERY- IN A VERY. IMPORTANT ROLE AS IT RELATES TO GOVERNANCE AS IT RELATES TO REGULATING. IT RELATES TO ENFORCEMENT AND- IT ALSO AS IT RELATES TO- EDUCATE AND GREATER AWARENESS. OUT WE HAVE- A VERY TALENTED AND CAPABLE LEADER AND CURRENTLY LEADING THAT THE PART OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS IN. MINOR I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH. EXTEND PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO THE CALL THAT NINETEEN AND PANDEMIC WE WORKED ON THE NUMBER OF EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AT TO AUGMENT- AND TO AND TO ASSIST WITH THE HEALTH SEARCH- GIVEN SOME OF THE LESSONS HE POPULATION. AND I WOULD SAY THAT AS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO STAY FOCUSED ON PROTECTING CONSUMERS ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO. STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICE AND- AS WE BEGIN TO THINK THROUGH THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY- VIEW THAT- MANY WAYS FIRST THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT. TWO FIVE FLEXING TO ENABLE LICENSEES TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND EXERCISE OF THEIR- WE ARE LOOKING- MADAM CHAIR AT WAYS TO INCORPORATE SOME OF THOSE LESSONS- SPECIFICALLY- WE HAVE- RECOGNIZE THAT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT LICENSE YOU CAN DO I WITH THE USE OF ONLINE TRAINING AND TECHNOLOGY. AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO BE MORE LASER FOCUSED ON THAT. AGAIN YOU KNOW CONTINUING TO STRIKE THE BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING CONSUMERS. PROVIDING AND IT FORCES INTO ORDER. ARE AND THEN ALSO REALLY SERVING AS A PARTNER IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL EDUCATION GEN. TO MEET. I GUESS THE JOB JUST DON'T BIT ON THAT. THE BALANCE OF PUBLIC PROTECTION I IT YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO AN INSTITUTION LIKE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT APPROVES THOSE LICENSES- VERSUS AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. BEFORE ANY OF THE MANY BOARDS I DON'T I DON'T EVEN FRANKLY KNOW HOW MANY BOARDS. ALL UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS BUT- MAYBE YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THAT BALANCE WHEN IT COMES TO. YOU KNOW THE LICENSEE VERSUS THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC CONSUMERS I SEE I SEE I AND I UNDERSTAND THE AT THAT THE VARIOUS BOARDS AND YOU'RE ALL SET ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AND- FOR APPROVING- CHANGES- TO. ADD THE- WE ARE ALSO STANDARD AND THIS IS YOU KNOW FRANKLY- AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE. YOU KNOW TAT THAT THAT WE ARE CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWS FOR ENGAGEMENT FROM LICENSEES STARBOARD MEETINGS ARE PUBLIC BOARD MEETINGS THAT ENABLE LICENSEES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK.

IT OPENED MY EYES TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE REWARDS OF PUBLIC SERVICE. AND I WANTED TO DUPLICATE THAT SUCCESS ACROSS THE STATE. WHEN I STARTED A LITTLE OVER TWELVE WEEKS AGO HAD THREE GOALS IN MIND. ADVANCING STRATEGIES THAT SUPPORT GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCIES EXPANDING GOVERNMENT INNOVATION AND CONTRIBUTING TO A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. I WOULD HAVE NEVER PREDICTED THAT I WOULD FIND MYSELF- ON DAY TWO IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WITH THE CHARGE TO LEAD THE TRANSITION OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STATE EMPLOYEES. TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO WORK FROM HOME I DEVELOPING POLICIES PROCEDURES AND GUIDANCE TO ENSURE THAT WE COULD ALL MONITOR AND SAFEGUARD DATA. AS WE INTRODUCE NEW PLATFORMS FOR WORKING MEETING. ADDITIONALLY I WOULD HAVE NEVER HAVE IMAGINED HELPING TO LEAD WHILE TRYING TO PROCESS THE IMPLICATIONS. WHAT WE ALL SAW THE WORLD IN RESPONSE TO THE DEATH OF MISTER GEORGE FLOYD AND WHAT IT MEANT TO ME AND FAMILY. ALL WHILE TRYING TO CONTINUE TO FULFILL MY ROLE AS SECRETARY. BUT WITH CHALLENGES- OPPORTUNITIES AND- SAME GOALS I CAME TO GOV OPS TO ACHIEVE. ARE NOW MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE TO ME. OUR TEAM A DEVOPS AND THE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE AGENCY WILL BE FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EFFICIENCIES AND A TIME THAT ARE BUDGET DEMANDS. LEVERAGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND XCELERATED INNOVATION TO REDUCE REDUNDANCY. REVEALING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT EQUITY AND INCLUSION IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF ALL WE DO.

I HAVEN'T READ THE GOVERNOR'S BOOKS CITIZEN BILL WHICH WHICH IS WAS DURING HIS TIME AS MAYOR FOR HEAT HE TOOK A LOT OF INFORMATION AND DATA AND PROGRAMS ON THE ONLINE SIFTED POWER CITIZENS. AND I'M- BUT BELIEVE ME BECAUSE THIS PANDEMIC WE'RE GONNA TRY TO BE PUTTING A LOT MORE THINGS ONLINE- WITH MY COLLEAGUE HERE SAID A ROUGH AND I WE USED TO SET A BUDGET SUB FOR WHERE WE WOULD HEAR HORROR STORY AFTER HORROR STORY- THESE I. T. PLATFORMS AND NOT NOT WORKING. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SHOULD PREPARE FOR POTENTIAL ON SET OF NEW IT PROJECTS AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO GUARANTEE THAT THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL. ABSOLUTE QUESTION YES THEY SHOULD PREPARE FOR THAT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN- INTRODUCED IT IS A PROCESS CALLED THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE CYCLE OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY HAS REALIZE SOME SUCCESSES WITH USING THAT PROCESS WITH IT PROJECTS AS WE ALL KNOW IN GOVERNMENT THERE'S A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT WHAT DID YOU WORK BUT WHAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU IS THE LAST ONE E.

HOW THAT OVERSIGHT IS WORKING AND WHAT IF ANY ADAPTATIONS HAVE HAD TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF WHAT WOULD NINETEEN. I KNOW THE GOAL OF CALIFORNIANS TO TRY TO FILL SOME OF OUR REACH GAPS THAT. WE DON'T FEEL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT REACH IS. IS COMMITTED TO SELL HOW DO WE HANDLE THAT WITH COVERT NINETEEN THANK YOU. SURE SENATOR MODEL THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YES IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE COLD BUT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. DID PUT A HALT TO ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUES THAT WE KNOW HAPPENS WITH THE CENSUS AND THAT'S OUR FIELD OPERATIONS. HOWEVER I REALLY COMMEND ESPECIALLY- DURING THE TIME WHEN WE HERE AT THE AGENCY WAS SO FOCUSED ON ON THE PANDEMIC UP FOCUSED ON LOOKING AT ALTERNATE TECHNIQUES REACHING- COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THE HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES ARE CREATIVE WAYS OF LEVERAGING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAD. SOME OF THE APPROACHES THAT HAVE COME ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC- AND KEEPING UP THE PRESSURE ON WITH REGARD TO INFORMATION ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. FOR ONE TO FILL OUT THE CENSUS WE ARE ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR THE US CENSUS BUREAU TO UP THE NUMERATORS IN THE BILL BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE. METHOD OF FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS SINCE. I'M IN ADDITION WE ARE BEFORE I REACH PARTNERS WHO ARE RIGHT NOW COMING UP WITH STRATEGIES THAT WILL COMPLEMENT THOSE IN RAIDERS. ALL YOU DON'T ALWAYS THIS IS ALL HAN ON DECK. AND WE REALLY OF. THE END. OF OTHERS ON. THIS TECHNIQUES THAT WE CAN USE AND LEVERAGE ARE TO REACH ALL COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES COLOR- IN OUR IMMIGRANTS COMMUNITIES SO- LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THANK YOU IN IN JUST A SHORT FOLLOW UP ON. AS THAT MONEY GOES OUT TO SOME LOCAL. AGENCIES OR ORGANIZATIONS. TO IMPLEMENT- THE STATE'S OBJECTIVES ON THE CENSUS OUT REACH.

AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AT THIS VERY- TO CONTINUE TO SERVE I SHOULD SAY IN THIS NEW ROLE I YOUR AND AN INCREDIBLY- DIFFICULT TIME ON SO MANY FRONTS AND CERTAINLY I AGREE WITH MR VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE I. T. WORLD ALONE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO OVERSEE FOR A STATE THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA AND OBVIOUSLY COMING FROM COVER CALIFORNIA. WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE A VERY SUCCESSFUL- PROGRAM- THAT THE STATE EMBRACED EARLY ON- AND DID SO VERY DIRECT WITH COMMUNITY. WAY THAT I THINK I MADE IT INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT BUT A VERY IMPRESSIVE. I ENDEAVOR ON THE PART OF CALIFORNIA. I'M GONNA. JUST FOLLOW ALONG SENATOR MINING'S OUR COMMENTS BECAUSE- THE- BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE- REALLY JUMPED IN VERY QUICKLY ON THE COMPLETE COUNT. AND THE CENSUS PROGRAM GOT VERY BUSY AT WORK MY- BOTH MY REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ALIKE HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN MAKING SURE- THAT WE ARE PARTNERS ON THE GROUND IT IS A LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE AND THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO DO ALL OF THIS WORK IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS BUT A I THINK YOU'RE QUITE AWARE AS YOU STEP INTO THIS ROLE THAT THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF FRUSTRATION. BECAUSE THE STATE REALLY STEPPED UP- ARE A WITH A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR. SINCE THIS OUTRAGE THE KEY AT TARGETED COMMUNITIES AND I JUST WANNA UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT. WE NOW KNOW THAT CONTRACTS ARE BEING REVISITED DUE TO THE THREE MONTH EXTENSION. AND THAT THE NUMBERS ARE NOT WHERE ARE THEY WERE COMPARED ABLE TO- TWENTY TEN. AND THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS FOR THAT IS VERY CLEAR OBVIOUSLY BUT IN TERMS OF A DIET ADJUSTING AND FIGURED OUT. A BETTER WAY TO REACH THOSE. NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UPS- WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE IN AUGUST AUGUST- THROUGH OCTOBER. REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS ON TIMING AND DISTRIBUTING THOSE FUNDS AND ENSURING THAT THEY GET TO THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES WHICH I KNOW YOU COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS TRANSLATES INTO DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIA. I THAT WE OBVIOUSLY ARE GOING TO NEED ESPECIALLY NOW SO. REALLY WANT A COMMITMENT THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE LOOKED AT- AND THE CONCERNS OF THE SENATORS ARE COLLEAGUES I HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD. THAT I THESE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO GET WHERE THEY NEED TO GO ON THE GROUND TO DO THAT WORK AND- JUST KIND OF WANTED YOUR REACTION TO THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THIS. ABSOLUTELY AND I HAVE AND I APPRECIATE THAT- YOUR YOUR COMMENT- AT APPROACH HIM. WE ARE THAT DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THAT AND WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS AND THE WORK AND THE COLLABORATION AND THE INPUT- FROM THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS- ONE OF THE PRIMARY FOCUS FOR ME IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS TO GET UP TO SPEED. AND WE RECOGNIZE WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY BEFORE US LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR APPROACH IN OUR TECHNIQUES GOING FORWARD. CERTAINLY WE HAVE THE US CENSUS BUREAU DATA WHICH SHOWS AS WHERE WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO IN TERMS OF LOW RESPONSE RATE AND SO WE'RE NEARING OUR STRATEGIES AND OUR FOCUS WITH THERE ARE WHICH PARTNERS. TO THOSE CENSUS TRACKS- AND WE DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS TEN MILLION DOLLARS LEFT AND WE WANT TO ALLOCATE AT LEAST EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. IF YOU ARE OUTRAGE PARTNERS TO CONTINUE THEIR EFFORTS I ESPECIALLY WITH THE EXTENSION OF THE CENSUS CAMPAIGN- A STRATEGY THAT WE THINK WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR ALL OF US AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK. IS HOLDING BACK SOME DOLLARS SO WHEN THOSE LAST FEW MONTHS WHEN IT'S SO CRITICAL IF WE NEED TO MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS OR WE NEED TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT OR WE NEED TO FIND COMPLEMENTARY. TECHNIQUES ARE HIS I WILL THE FINANCE RESOURCES TO DO SO- IN ADDITION- LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER WE DO HAVE A DASHBOARD THAT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL OF US. TO TRACK THIS REAL TIME SO THAT WE CAN REACT AS QUICKLY AS WE NEED TO. WE KNOW HOW CRITICAL IT IS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A COMPLETE COUNT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN THOSE HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES AGAIN THOSE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND ACROSS THE STATE AND SO WE WILL BE MAINTAINING A VERY CLOSE WATCH ON THIS THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR AGENCY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH.
