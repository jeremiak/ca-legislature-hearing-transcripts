THIS COVER NINETEEN AS PANDEMIC

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:44.783
ALL OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:49.354
UNDERSERVED- OUR- REGIONS-

00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:50.789
LOCALITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:53.358
THAT THAT WE FACED- THAT WE WERE

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:55.126
ALREADY FACING A CERTAINLY

00:24:55.193 --> 00:24:57.863
EXPANDED. BEYOND ANYTHING WE HAD

00:24:57.929 --> 00:24:59.197
EVER ANTICIPATED YOU TALK ABOUT

00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:01.499
EDUCATION WAS IMPACTED IN IN NEW

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:03.568
AND SOME PROFOUND WAYS IS THE

00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:05.904
DIGITAL D. D. DIVIDED IT TORE

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:07.906
OUR STATE APART SEPARATE THOSE

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:09.007
WHO CAN ACCESS THEIR SCHOOL

00:25:09.074 --> 00:25:11.109
WORK. AND THOSE LIKE THE YOUNG

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.345
GIRLS AND- THAT VIRTUAL PHOTO

00:25:13.411 --> 00:25:14.679
THAT WERE SITTING IN FRONT OF A

00:25:14.746 --> 00:25:16.915
TALK ABOUT TRYING TO ACCESS. THE

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:18.183
INTERNET TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.284
UNFORTUNATE THAT WAS IN THE

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.052
DISTRICT I REPRESENT IN THE

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:23.154
SALINAS VALLEY. UP BUT YOU KNOW

00:25:23.221 --> 00:25:25.023
THERE WAS NO ECONOMIC STABILITY

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.758
FOR SO MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS SO

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:29.060
MANY OF OUR CALIFORNIANS BUT IN

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:30.929
PARTICULAR. WE SUCH A WORKERS

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:32.264
WORKERS IN HOSPITALITY IN

AGRICULTURE AND OTHER INDUSTRIES

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:35.233
THAT WERE HIT INCREDIBLY HARD BY

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.136
THIS PANDEMIC. BUT I THINK YOU

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:39.871
KNOW TO PUT A FINER POINT ON IT

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:44.676
IN SO MANY WAYS ARE- LOCALITIES.

00:25:44.743 --> 00:25:47.045
ARE COMMUNITIES WERE SUFFERING

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:49.814
ALREADY. WE WERE WOEFULLY

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:52.183
UNPREPARED FOR THIS PANDEMIC-

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.052
AND AS WE RECOVER WE CAN JUST

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:57.522
REBUILD WHAT EXISTED PRIOR- IF

00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.190
WE WANT TO ACHIEVE TRUE HEALTH

00:25:59.257 --> 00:26:00.625
THE SOCIAL EQUITY FOR ALL

00:26:00.692 --> 00:26:02.027

WE MUST MOVE FORWARD. AND I'M

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:04.696
EXCITED BE PART OF THIS

00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:07.165
DISCUSSION AND OF- THIS

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.033

CERTAINLY BECAUSE OF THIS

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:31.156
PANDEMIC IT HAS BROUGHT TO THE

00:26:31.222 --> 00:26:33.792
FOREFRONT WE'VE SEEN IT- WE'VE

SEEN IT FIRSTHAND IN OUR

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:37.095
COMMUNITIES. AND IT THE PURPOSE

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:38.897
IS TO ONE EXPOSE IT EVEN ON A

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:41.032
GRADE LEVEL. ON A STATE LEVEL

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:42.701
BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT

COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE NOT

00:26:44.202 --> 00:26:46.671
LEFT BEHIND- AS IT RELATES TO

FOCUS ON THIS WE SHINE THE LIGHT

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:56.314
NECESSARY. TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.592
HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE DYING WHEN

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:10.061
IT COMES OUT TO A PANDEMIC. OR

BACK TO PRE PANDEMIC CONDITIONS

00:30:01.132 --> 00:30:02.767

THAT WHEN LOCAL ACTIONS

00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:16.848
REFLECTED THIS ORIENTATION

ORANGE COUNTY AND OTHER

CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES WILL BE

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:23.021
BETTER POSITIONED TO REFRAIN

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:24.856

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:53.284
VITALITY OF SUCH COMMUNITIES. IN

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:55.153
ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE SEEN THAT

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.721
HEALTH EQUITY HAS BEEN AN

00:30:56.788 --> 00:30:59.123
AFTERTHOUGHT AT BEST IN THE

CONTACT TRACING AND VACCINATION

00:31:13.838 --> 00:31:16.274
STRATEGIES WAS LEFT UP TO LOCAL

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:18.476
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IN

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:20.812
CASES WHERE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:22.780
HAS A STRONG EQUITY BACKGROUND

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:24.549
THIS APPROACH MAKES PERFECT

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:27.085
SENSE. UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:28.820
PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONERS

00:31:28.886 --> 00:31:30.888
WOULD BE KEENLY AWARE OF LOCAL

ALREADY BE WORKING IN CLOSE

THEM TO SEE EMERGING AND

THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.209
. IN ORANGE COUNTY THIS WAS NOT

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:53.211
OUR EXPERIENCE. WE THOUGHT

IS UNFAIR UNJUST INCREMENTAL

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.181
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE TO BREAK

00:39:44.248 --> 00:39:46.183
THOSE CYCLES TO BUILD BACK

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.786

QUESTION I HAVE IS TO EITHER-

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:20.557
DOCTOR YOUNGER DOCTOR LAVON- AND

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:22.526

THE STATE DO BETTER FOR

00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:28.065
COMMUNITIES IN AREAS FOR THEM TO

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:31.802
BETTER SERVE- COMMUNITIES. WHERE

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:35.906
HEALTH DISPARITIES INEQUITIES

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:38.075

FIRST. I'M SO I'M REALLY

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.320
ENCOURAGED TO HEAR ABOUT THE

00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:52.022
RESOURCES THAT ARE COMING DOWN

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:54.224
THE PIPELINE TO ADDRESS COVE ED

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:57.361
ARE INEQUITIES AND RECOVERY. AND

00:44:57.428 --> 00:44:58.595
I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S REALLY

00:44:58.662 --> 00:45:00.197
IMPORTANT WHEN DISTRIBUTING THE

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:03.200
STATE RESOURCES TO BE GREETING

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:05.335
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ON HOW

00:45:05.402 --> 00:45:07.504
THEY'RE APPEARING WITH RESPECT

00:45:07.571 --> 00:45:09.239
TO HEALTH EQUITY. WHEN IT IS

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:10.674
FOUND THAT LOCAL HEALTH

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.709
DEPARTMENTS ARE FAILING WHEN IT

00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:14.244
COMES TO HEALTH EQUITY IT THEN

00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:15.379
THE STATE REALLY NEEDS TO BE

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:16.880
THINKING ABOUT MECHANISMS OF

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:19.049
COMMUNITY ACCOUNTABILITY. SO

00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:20.317
THAT THE RESOURCES CAN BE

00:45:20.384 --> 00:45:21.852
FUNNELED TO COMMUNITIES

00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:23.887
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BUT

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:25.189
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:28.125
ARE NOT AN IMPORTANT BARRIER TO

00:45:28.192 --> 00:45:30.227
IMPLEMENTATION. THROUGHOUT THE

00:45:30.294 --> 00:45:31.628
PROCESS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:33.363
AND HE'S A COLOR NEED TO BE TOP

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.799
OF MIND- AND SO WE NEED TO BE

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:36.934
THINKING ABOUT THE MULTIPLE

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.969
FEEDBACK LOOPS SO CERTAINLY THAT

00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:41.138
DIRECT- HOPEFULLY SORT OF

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:43.107
INTENDED OUTCOMES OF. THE

00:45:43.173 --> 00:45:44.942
FUNDING AND DIFFERENT POLICIES

00:45:45.008 --> 00:45:46.276
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE THINKING

00:45:46.343 --> 00:45:46.977
ABOUT FEEDBACK LOOPS AND

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:49.480
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS WELL.

00:45:49.546 --> 00:45:52.249
I AND MY HOPE IS THAT WE WILL

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:54.184
CONTINUE TO WORK TO STRENGTHEN

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:56.787
EFFORTS TO WORK ALONGSIDE LOCAL

THAT- HELLO OF OUR STUDENTS. IS

00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:37.761
RACISM IS. IN THE SCIENCES SO IT

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:38.896
IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

00:46:38.962 --> 00:46:41.265
STATE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS

00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:43.467
ACCESS TO EDUCATION. ESPECIALLY

MY COMMUNITY MY FAMILY. BECAUSE

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:26.643
OF THE EDUCATION I RECEIVED. IT

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:28.011
IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:30.214
SPEECH WAS SHORT THAT MORE

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.783
STUDENTS OF COLOR. THAT BLACK

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:36.286
BROWN NATIVE AMERICANS THAT WE

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:39.056
HAD ACCESS TO EDUCATION. THAT

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:39.656
WE'RE NOT LOADED WITH STUDENT

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:41.792

FORGIVEN AS WELL THAT WAY WE CAN

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:52.569
WORK IN A COMMUNITY MORE. SO IT

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:55.739
IS IMPORTANT IN ALL OF THOSE

00:47:55.806 --> 00:48:00.844
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS TO ENSURE.

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:05.115
THAT THERE IS ACCESS FOR THOSE.

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:07.818
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES I WANTED

00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:09.620

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:13.323
IS THAT IS AREAS THE STATE HAS

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.759
FINDING OUT HOW THE NEW

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:18.462
INFRASTRUCTURE THE BILL HAS GONE

00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:20.864
OUT AND WE HOPE THAT WILL GO

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:25.168
THROUGH. WE NEED TO BUILD-

00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:29.039
ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHY RIGHT.

00:48:29.106 --> 00:48:32.175

FOR PEOPLE. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:46.823

WHO. YOU KNOW CARRIES BELIEVES

00:48:53.597 --> 00:49:00.070
OF RACISM OR CLASSISM. THE STATE

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:04.608
HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO ASK PEOPLE

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:06.343
. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE

IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE

00:52:43.793 --> 00:52:46.429
BUILDING UP STATEWIDE COALITIONS

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:48.031

ABOUT MARKET RATE HOUSING.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.955
BECAUSE THOSE MARKET RATE

OPTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THE

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:43.192
PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO WE

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:46.362

HEALTHY FOODS NOT FAST FOOD

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:19.929
RESTAURANTS. RIGHT SO WE NEED TO

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:21.164
MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:23.733

TRANSIT AND THE LIST GOES ON AND

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:48.858
ON SO AGAIN WE HAVE TO BE

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:49.859
INTENTIONAL JUST BUILDING

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:52.895

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.964
TO A LAN FIELD IS NOT ACCEPTABLE

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:57.200
. THAT IS NOT THE ANSWER THE

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:59.101
OTHER PIECE OF COURSE IS

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:01.204
EMPLOYMENT STABILITY.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:05.508
UNFORTUNATELY ALL THESE FACTORS

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:07.577
AT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WHICH

OF COURSE HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:14.417
BUT FROM OUR LANDS AS- AND LGBTQ

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:17.186
COMMUNITY SPACE. WE HAVE TO MAKE

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:21.357
SURE THAT ALL THESE AREAS. BRING

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:26.028

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:32.268
WELCOMING AND ACCEPTANCE WE

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:36.172

OURSELVES WHEN WE WALK WORK

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:41.410
EXCUSE ME WALK INTO A PLACE OF

OURSELVES WHEN WE ACCESS HEALTH

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:58.227
CARE SERVICES. RIGHT SO AGAIN I

01:04:58.294 --> 01:04:59.362

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.604
THIS COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT HAD

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.572
THE LIVED EXPERIENCE THAT HAVE

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:45.741
THE HISTORY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:49.145

WITH HIV. SO WHAT CAN WE DO.

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:52.575
AGAIN WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:55.144
WE HAVE TO BE PURPOSEFUL. WHEN

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:57.179

INTENTIONAL ABOUT HOW WE

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:10.626

ABOUT HEALTH DISPARITIES. IT'S

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:34.396

COMMUNITY NOT JUST ONE

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:39.969
UNDERSCORE FROM THINGS I THINK

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:41.203
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. L. A.

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.072
COUNTY MAKES UP TWENTY FIVE

01:10:43.138 --> 01:10:43.872
POINT 2% OF THE POPULATION THE

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:46.108
STATE. IT HAS THIRTY FOUR POINT

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:49.712
2% OF ALL HIV DIAGNOSIS. THE

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:50.613
MOST COMMON MEANS OF

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:51.880
TRANSMISSION IS MEN WITH SEX

01:10:51.947 --> 01:10:54.116
WITH MEN EIGHTY ONE PERCENT. 50%

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:55.451
OF THESE DIAGNOSIS WERE AMONG

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:59.154
LATINO MSM 20% WHITE 21% BLACK

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:02.524
AND 5% APR. BLACKS MAKE UP 21%

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:05.027
OF NEW HIV CASES IN L. A. COUNTY

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.829
IN SPITE OF BEING A PERCENT OF

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:09.031
POPULATION. IT IS JUST M THE

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.933
TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS MAKE UP

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.168
QUITE ONE THE TWENTY POINT 5% OF

01:11:13.235 --> 01:11:14.303
THE TOTAL PACKAGE L. A. COUNTY

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:17.039
YET THEY MAKE UP 2% OF NEW HIV

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.307
POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS IN TWENTY

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:20.442
EIGHTEEN. AND HIV CONTINUES TO

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:22.111
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT YOUNG

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:24.079
GAY BISEXUAL MEN OF COLOR. ALONG

01:11:24.146 --> 01:11:25.848
WITH HIV WE ARE TALK ABOUT STDS

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:26.982
AS WELL BECAUSE WE CURRENTLY

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:28.751
HAVE AN STD EPIDEMIC THAT'S OUT

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.753
OF CONTROL WITH UNFORTUNATE

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:32.454
ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE ARE NOW IN

01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:33.622
A TIME WHERE WE HAVE EVERYTHING

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.491
THAT WE NEED TO END HIV

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:36.725
EPIDEMIC. AS WELL AS A FEW

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:38.727
DIFFERENT IMAGE WE GET WE DON'T

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:42.331
AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS. A

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:43.332
CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING

01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:45.234
ABOUT. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.535
ALREADY IMPACTED BY RACIAL

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:48.537
ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION.

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:49.505
UNDERSCORE CARLOS'S POINT

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:50.973
THEY'RE BEING DISCRIMINATED

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:51.874
AGAINST BY WHO THEY ARE AND WHO

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.609
THEY LOVE. AND THIS LACK OF

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:55.177
ACCESS TO CULTURALLY RELEVANT

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:57.112
SERVICES AND SO I THINK THE

01:11:57.179 --> 01:11:58.614
LUCIANS REALLY ARE ABOUT

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.182
PROVIDING RESOURCES TO EXISTING

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:02.184
CBO TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:03.686
COMMUNITIES. TO EXPAND THEIR

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:04.953
INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDE

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.056
ADDITIONAL SERVICES. I THINK

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:08.791
ALSO FOR ANYONE WHO PROVIDING

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:10.659
SERVICES ARE FUNDED BY THE STATE

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:12.027
THE RELEASE BE CLOSELY COPSEY

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:13.996
TRAINING ON TERMS OF HOW TO DEAL

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:16.165
WITH LGBTQ FOLKS BECAUSE IT IS A

01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:18.434
SPECIAL. TYPE OF THING AND ALL

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.234
YOU NEED IS SOMEONE TO GO INTO A

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:20.969
SPACE WHERE THEY TRY TO GET

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:23.038
SERVICES. AND THEY ARE THEIR

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:25.574
INCOMING SOME NONSENSE AROUND I

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:26.341
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE I

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:27.476
DON'T GET TO PRO NOW YOU DON'T

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.044
LOOK LIKE THIS AND ALL THAT

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:30.145
RIGHT IT'S ABOUT PROVIDING

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:31.780
SERVICES. WE TO ADDRESS HIV

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.816
STIGMA BECAUSE IT IS STILL REAL

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:34.750
THAT KEEP PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:36.452
SERVICES. WE ALSO NEED TO

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.187

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:48.088

PATIENTS HAVE DIFFERENT FOCUSES

01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:56.230
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS THEY WORK

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:58.198
WITH- CLINICS PROVIDE A WIDE

01:38:58.265 --> 01:39:00.234
VARIETY OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS

ABOUT. FOOD PANTRIES IN ROMAN

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:09.243
INTO CALFRESH- HOUSING

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:12.146

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:13.314
LAUNDRY LIST YOU'RE YOU'RE

PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE SOUTH

01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:16.050
LA CLINIC THAT HAS A PROGRAM TO

01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:16.950
HELP PATIENTS ADDRESS HOUSING

01:39:17.017 --> 01:39:19.486
ISSUES PROVIDING LEGAL SUPPORT-

01:39:19.553 --> 01:39:20.821
WE'VE GOT A PATIENT A CLINIC ON

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:22.456
SKID ROW TAT'S HELPING PATIENTS

01:39:22.523 --> 01:39:23.524
WITH MEDICATIONS STORAGE JUST

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:25.059
THE LITTLE THINGS TO TRY TO

01:39:25.125 --> 01:39:26.627
HELP. PATIENTS ADDRESS SOME OF

01:39:26.694 --> 01:39:27.594
THOSE LARGER THINGS IN THEIR

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:29.396
LIFE THAT ARE IMPACTING THEIR

01:39:29.463 --> 01:39:32.700
HEALTH- I FLAG THAT ISN'T

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:33.567
THINKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS OF

01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:35.069
COURSE WE MENTIONED RESOURCES

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:36.437
BUT I WILL FLAG FLEXIBILITY AND

01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:39.273
RESOURCES- THAT NEED FOR CLINICS

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:41.275
TO BE ABLE TO. TO DO WHAT THEY

01:39:41.342 --> 01:39:42.609
DO BEST TO DO WHAT WILL MEET THE

01:39:42.676 --> 01:39:43.644
NEEDS OF THEIR PARTICULAR

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:44.778
COMMUNITIES AND THE PATIENTS

01:39:44.845 --> 01:39:46.680
THEY SERVE- THAT IT'S NOT ONE

01:39:46.747 --> 01:39:48.449
SIZE FITS ALL WHEN IT COMES TO

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:49.016
ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF OUR

01:39:49.083 --> 01:39:52.252
COMMUNITIES- I DO THINK THAT THE

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:54.054
FLAG WORTH MAKING. CLINICS ARE

01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:55.189
TAKING SOME STEPS IN THIS

01:39:55.255 --> 01:39:56.824
DIRECTION ALREADY WERE. WORKING

01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:58.258
WITH DHS TO ADJUST THE WAY

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:00.227
CLINICS ARE PAID- WHICH WILL

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:01.562
PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND

01:40:01.628 --> 01:40:03.297
ALLOW CLINICS TO USE DIFFERENT

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:04.498
PROVIDERS PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:07.067
WRAPAROUND TYPE SERVICES- SO

01:40:07.134 --> 01:40:07.601
THAT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:10.137
DIRECTION. BUT MAINTAINING

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:12.373
TELEHEALTH IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT

01:40:12.439 --> 01:40:13.774
FLAG ON SO MAINTAINING THE

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.376
ABILITY OF CLINICS- MAINTAIN THE

01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:17.244
ABILITY OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS TO

01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:19.046
CONTINUE UTILIZING TELEHEALTH

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:22.082
ACCESS CARE- SO MANY POTENTIAL

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:23.550
BARRIERS THAT THAT CAN OVERCOME

01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:24.752
WHICH WE SAW DURING THE WHOLE OF

01:40:24.818 --> 01:40:26.353
IT. YOU KNOW NOT NOT JUST

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:27.955
BECAUSE OF IT IN THE NEED TO YOU

01:40:28.021 --> 01:40:28.555
KNOW SOCIAL DISTANCE OR STAY

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:31.058
HOME. BUT ALSO TIME OFF WORK

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:32.926
CHILD CARE TRANSPORTATION RIGHT

01:40:32.993 --> 01:40:35.062
TELEHEALTH HAS SO MUCH PROMISE

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:36.463
FOR OUR BEING ABLE TO EXPAND

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:38.165
ACCESS IN THE FUTURE. AND WHEN I

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:40.134
MENTIONED TELEHEALTH- WE MENTION

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.403
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- AND THE

01:40:42.469 --> 01:40:43.270
IMPORTANCE OF RETAINING AUDIO

01:40:43.337 --> 01:40:45.172
VISITS. AND WE CAN'T JUST DO

01:40:45.239 --> 01:40:46.440
TELEHEALTH AND ASSUME THAT

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:47.541
EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO YOU KNOW

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:51.211
STREAM FIVE G. AND VIDEO VISITS-

01:40:51.278 --> 01:40:52.780
THE REALITY IS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE

01:40:52.846 --> 01:40:54.882
YET FOR MANY OF OUR PATIENTS-

01:40:54.948 --> 01:40:56.150
AND SO MAINTAINING THAT

01:40:56.216 --> 01:40:57.317
CONNECTION VIA AUDIO AS WELL AS

01:40:57.384 --> 01:41:02.256
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT- TWO. TWO

01:41:02.322 --> 01:41:03.891
THINGS THE FLAG ONE WHICH DR

01:41:03.957 --> 01:41:05.859
YOUNG REFERENCE SOME AND ALLUDED

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:07.795
TO IS THE BIGGEST CRISIS

01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:09.930
POTENTIALLY FACING CLINICS RIGHT

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:12.699
NOW IS WORKFORCE- I CAN I THINK

01:41:12.766 --> 01:41:14.535
I CAN SAFELY SAY EVERY SINGLE

01:41:14.601 --> 01:41:16.870
CLINIC ON OUR MEMBERSHIP. HAS

01:41:16.937 --> 01:41:18.071
MULTIPLE POSITIONS OPEN THAT

01:41:18.138 --> 01:41:19.606
THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO FILL-

01:41:19.673 --> 01:41:21.575
THIS WAS A CRISIS PRIOR TO COPE

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:22.576
WITH IT AND IT'S JUST BEEN

01:41:22.643 --> 01:41:25.012
EXACERBATED BY COVE IN. EXISTING

01:41:25.078 --> 01:41:26.513
WORK FORCES OVER BURDENED

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:29.983
OVERWORKED STRESSED OUT- WE

01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:31.118
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WE DON'T HAVE

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:32.119
PHYSICIANS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:33.921
PROVIDERS WE DON'T HAVE ALLIED

01:41:33.987 --> 01:41:36.123
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS YOU KNOW

01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:37.624
THE- SOCIAL WORKERS. CALL

01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:39.460
CENTERS FRONT DESK WE DON'T HAVE

01:41:39.526 --> 01:41:42.296
ENOUGH STAFF. AND THAT WILL

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:42.930
HAMPER OUR ABILITY TO DO

01:41:42.996 --> 01:41:44.698
ANYTHING ABOVE AND BEYOND- SO I

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:46.133
FLAG THIS BECAUSE I AM A BIT

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:47.701
DISSIPATING THAT WILL BE LOOKING

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:49.336
TO LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. TO

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:51.171
PROVIDE SUPPORT WITH REGARD TO

01:41:51.238 --> 01:41:52.706
HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE IN A

01:41:52.773 --> 01:41:53.841
PARTICULAR PRIMARY CARE WORK

01:41:53.907 --> 01:41:55.442
FORCE- AND SO THAT'S YOU KNOW

01:41:55.509 --> 01:41:56.610
LONGER PAYMENT OF THINGS THAT

01:41:56.677 --> 01:41:58.378
WERE MENTIONED- IT'S ALSO.

01:41:58.445 --> 01:42:00.447
PROGRAMS AND SUPPORTS TO MAKE

01:42:00.514 --> 01:42:01.682
SURE DEVELOPING THE WORK FORCE

01:42:01.748 --> 01:42:03.617
THAT LOOKS LIKE AND FEELS LIKE

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:05.118
OUR PATIENTS I THINK THAT. YOU

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:06.386
KNOW CARLOS TORRES OF REMARKS

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:09.389
HERE- WE NEED A WORKFORCE THAT

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:10.624
OUR PATIENTS ARE COMFORTABLE

01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:12.259
WORKING WITH RIGHT WE WANT

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:12.826
PEOPLE TO WALK WALK INTO A

01:42:12.893 --> 01:42:14.728
CLINIC AND FEEL LIKE. THEY'RE AT

01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:17.030
A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BE SERVED

01:42:17.097 --> 01:42:18.031
IN THAT THEY CAN BE APPRECIATED

01:42:18.098 --> 01:42:20.801
AND TREATED APPROPRIATELY- AND

01:42:20.868 --> 01:42:21.869
THAT'S A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK-

01:42:21.935 --> 01:42:22.970
WHICH STRUGGLING JUST WITH

01:42:23.036 --> 01:42:24.438
PROVIDERS IN GENERAL- AND SO

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:26.306
REALLY GROWING THAT WORK FORCE-

01:42:26.373 --> 01:42:29.376
AT ALL LEVELS- IS ONE OF THE

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:30.577
BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE FACE RIGHT

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:34.581
NOW. AND IT FEELS REALLY HARD TO

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:35.415
IMAGINE DOING. MORE YOU DON'T

01:42:35.482 --> 01:42:36.350
RESOURCES FOR SOCIAL

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:38.151
DETERMINANTS ARE GREAT BUT IF WE

01:42:38.218 --> 01:42:38.819
DON'T HAVE THE WORK FORCE TO PUT

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:39.553
BEHIND IT WILL BE

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.822
EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGE SO I

01:42:41.889 --> 01:42:43.891
THINK THAT'S- ONE TO MENTION.

01:42:43.957 --> 01:42:45.559
AND I'VE LOST TRACK OF MY TIME

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:47.261
BUT IF I MIGHT MENTION ONE LAST

01:42:47.327 --> 01:42:50.831
THING- SPEAKING TO FLEXIBILITY

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:52.266
AND RESOURCES AND HOW CRITICAL

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:55.102
THAT IS. CLINICS MANY CLINICS IN

01:42:55.168 --> 01:42:56.503
CALIFORNIA ARE LOOKING AT THE

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:58.338
IMPENDING LOSS OF ONE OF THE

01:42:58.405 --> 01:42:59.039
MORE FLEXIBLE FUNDING STREAMS

01:42:59.106 --> 01:43:01.008
THEY HAVE. AND THAT'S THE

01:43:01.074 --> 01:43:02.442
RESOURCES ASSOCIATED THAT THEY

01:43:02.509 --> 01:43:04.411
GET UNDER THE THREE FORTY DRUG

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:06.146
DISCOUNT PROGRAM. AND THE

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:07.247
STATE'S CHANGING WELL

01:43:07.314 --> 01:43:08.448
INTENTIONED THE PHARMACY BENEFIT

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:11.184
MEDIC HELL BUT LONG STORY SHORT.

01:43:11.251 --> 01:43:12.753
IT WILL ELIMINATE THE SAVINGS

01:43:12.819 --> 01:43:13.987
THAT CLINICS ARE ABLE TO REALIZE

01:43:14.054 --> 01:43:15.656
FROM THAT PROGRAM AND WE'RE

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:17.090
TALKING TO THE TUNES OF TENS OF

01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:19.293
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS I'M FOR A

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:21.261
LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS. AND THOSE

01:43:21.328 --> 01:43:23.063
ARE REALLY FLEXIBLE RESOURCES

01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:24.097
THEY'RE RESOURCES THE SUPPORT

01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:24.965
SOME OF THOSE WRAPAROUND

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.633

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:29.729
GETTING ACCESS TO VACCINES. IN

01:49:29.796 --> 01:49:31.464
OUR COUNTY WE MADE SURE THAT IF

01:49:31.531 --> 01:49:33.066
YOU COULDN'T SEE WALK TALK

01:49:33.133 --> 01:49:34.567
SOMEONE WOULD HOLD YOUR HAND AND

01:49:34.634 --> 01:49:35.535
GET YOU THROUGH AND GET YOU

01:49:35.602 --> 01:49:37.370
VACCINATED. AND BECAUSE OF ALL

01:49:37.437 --> 01:49:38.571
THE STRATEGIES WE HAVE THE

01:49:38.638 --> 01:49:40.140
VACCINE RATES THAT WE HAVE. AND

01:49:40.206 --> 01:49:41.541
MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED

01:49:41.608 --> 01:49:43.443
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FOR SURE.

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:44.311
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

01:49:44.377 --> 01:49:45.712
SAVED BECAUSE OF THESE VACCINES

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:47.380
BUT THE LESSON HERE. IS THAT WE

01:49:47.447 --> 01:49:48.581
WERE NOT AT THE TABLE WHEN THOSE

01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:52.018
VACCINE. WHEN THE DISTRIBUTION-

01:49:52.085 --> 01:49:54.487
ALLOCATIONS WERE MADE THEY WENT

01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:55.922
TO WONDERFUL PLACES AND WE

01:49:55.989 --> 01:49:57.991
APPLAUD THEM. USC UCLA

01:49:58.058 --> 01:49:59.626
CEDARHURST DIGNITY HEALTH KAISER

01:49:59.693 --> 01:50:01.661
PERMANENTE. BUT IT'S REALLY THE

01:50:01.728 --> 01:50:03.096
ROOTS IN THE GROUND IT'S REALLY

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:05.165
THAT NETWORK IN THE COMMUNITY

01:50:05.231 --> 01:50:07.367
THAT. IS READY TO RESPOND AND

01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:09.002
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE BUT AGAIN

01:50:09.069 --> 01:50:11.271
WE SOMEHOW GET. LEFT BEHIND WHEN

01:50:11.338 --> 01:50:12.539
THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE WHEN

01:50:12.605 --> 01:50:14.207
THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE BEING HAD.

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:15.442
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE

01:50:15.508 --> 01:50:17.410
TO BE LEFT BEHIND IF WE ARE WE

01:50:17.477 --> 01:50:19.112
REALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT IS.

01:50:19.179 --> 01:50:22.716
SOMETHING THAT- IS VIEWED AS- WE

01:50:22.782 --> 01:50:24.184
THINK ABOUT IF THIS TYPE OF

01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:25.218
ATROCITY OCCURS AGAIN IT'S

01:50:25.285 --> 01:50:26.786
NOTHING SHORT OF CRIMINAL TO BE

01:50:26.853 --> 01:50:28.355
HONEST I MEAN FOR THE MASCOT.

01:50:28.421 --> 01:50:32.459
ALL RIGHT- SO I ALSO WANTED TO

01:50:32.525 --> 01:50:33.093
SAY AND THE EARLIEST DAY AS WITH

01:50:33.159 --> 01:50:34.828
HER. RIDICULOUS THAT THERE WAS

01:50:34.894 --> 01:50:35.962
BLACK AND BROWN VACCINE

01:50:36.029 --> 01:50:37.831
HESITANCY FORTY TO SIXTY

01:50:37.897 --> 01:50:39.232
PERCENT. INSTEAD WHAT WE SAW IN

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:41.668
OUR COMMUNITY WAS. WHAT VACCINE

01:50:41.735 --> 01:50:42.602
I'VE NEVER BEEN OFFERED A

01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:44.004
VACCINE HOWEVER HOW MAY BEING

01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:45.572
DOCUMENTED AS SOMEONE WHO. IS

01:50:45.638 --> 01:50:47.607
RELUCTANT HESITANT REFUSING A

01:50:47.674 --> 01:50:49.843
VACCINE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE

01:50:49.909 --> 01:50:50.710
TO TURN TO GET VACCINES IN OUR

01:50:50.777 --> 01:50:53.213
COMMUNITY- IN ADDITION TO THOSE

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:54.914
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED IN

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:56.583
GETTING THESE VACCINES OUT. WE

01:50:56.649 --> 01:50:58.485
KNEW THAT- YOU KNOW WHAT

01:50:58.551 --> 01:50:59.886
CATHERINE WE PRACTICE THIS THING

01:50:59.953 --> 01:51:00.954
CALLED THE CADRE WE HAVE MANY

01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:02.422
MANTRAS AND- ONE IS THAT THE

01:51:02.489 --> 01:51:03.923
EXPERIENCE COUNTS WE TREAT

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:06.326
PEOPLE LIKE PEOPLE. WE RESPECT

01:51:06.393 --> 01:51:06.960
THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF EVERY

01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:09.029
HUMAN BEING. AND WE MEET PEOPLE

01:51:09.095 --> 01:51:10.296
WHERE THEY ARE VERY INTENSELY WE

01:51:10.363 --> 01:51:12.098
ENGAGE YOU EDUCATEYOU VACCINATE

01:51:12.165 --> 01:51:14.267
AND ACTIVATE YOU. WHETHER YOU'RE

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:15.635
WHITE BLACK BROWN YELLOW WHOEVER

01:51:15.702 --> 01:51:17.704
YOU ARE YOU HAD EVERY REASON TO

01:51:17.771 --> 01:51:19.906
HAVE. THESE CONCERNS QUESTIONS

01:51:19.973 --> 01:51:21.641
AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS

01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:23.176
OUR TRUSTED HEALTH PARTNER TO

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:25.178
TAKE THE TIME TO ANSWER YOUR

01:51:25.245 --> 01:51:26.746
QUESTIONS TO BE HONEST. TO

01:51:26.813 --> 01:51:28.748
EDUCATE YOU AND REALLY THAT'S

01:51:28.815 --> 01:51:30.417
HOW WE WOULD OVERCOME MANY OF

01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:31.751
THE LOWER VACCINATION RATES

01:51:31.818 --> 01:51:33.486
WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS

01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:35.388
NOT A EXPERIMENT ON OUR

01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:36.122
COMMUNITY THIS ISN'T THE

01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:38.358
TUSKEGEE TRIALS THE ABUSE OF

01:51:38.425 --> 01:51:39.893
HENRIETTA LACKS CELLS. THIS IS

01:51:39.959 --> 01:51:41.227
NOT THE UNDER TREATMENT OF BLACK

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:43.296
PAIN IN OUR HOSPITALS THESE ARE

01:51:43.363 --> 01:51:44.597
LIFESAVING ESSENTIAL MEDICINES

01:51:44.664 --> 01:51:45.665
AND UNFORTUNATELY DIGITAL

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:47.901
DEMANDS. HAVE SPREAD LIES THAT

01:51:47.967 --> 01:51:49.969
ARE ADVERSELY IMPACTING TRULY

01:51:50.036 --> 01:51:52.272
KILLING OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT-

01:51:52.338 --> 01:51:53.506
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:55.141
STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT WE MUST.

01:51:55.208 --> 01:51:57.544
CONTINUE TO SQUASH AS I WRAP UP

01:51:57.610 --> 01:51:59.479
MY COMMENTS I JUST WANT TO SAY

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:00.980
WE'VE LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS.

01:52:01.047 --> 01:52:02.449
THIS IS NOT JUST A PANDEMIC OF

01:52:02.515 --> 01:52:04.350
AN INFECTIOUS ILLNESS THIS IS A

01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:06.286
SOCIAL ILLNESS AN ILLNESS OF

01:52:06.352 --> 01:52:08.955
ISOLATION OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY.

01:52:09.022 --> 01:52:10.423
THIS IS A PANDEMIC OF MISSED

01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:12.592
CARE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES. TO

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:15.028
PREVENT TO MAINTAIN OUR HEALTH

01:52:15.095 --> 01:52:17.230
WE MUST GET BACK TO THAT. AND

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:18.031
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT WE

01:52:18.098 --> 01:52:19.933
CAN DEMOCRATIZE HEALTH THAT WE

01:52:19.999 --> 01:52:21.367
CAN MOVE AWAY FROM THE

01:52:21.434 --> 01:52:22.202
TRADITIONAL FOUR WALLS O OUR

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:24.003

DECENTRALIZING EQUITY LET'S TAKE

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.682
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED WITH THESE

01:52:35.748 --> 01:52:37.517
MOBILE VACCINATION EFFORTS THIS

01:52:37.584 --> 01:52:38.618
EQUITABLE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:40.420

01:52:40.487 --> 01:52:41.821

HERE ON THE GROUND CERTAINLY

01:54:11.211 --> 01:54:12.579
WHEN IT KIND. THE ONLY COMES TO

THE VACCINE. THE DISTRIBUTION.

01:54:15.248 --> 01:54:17.150
PROCESS THAT WE EXPERIENCED AND

01:54:17.217 --> 01:54:17.884
YOU KNOW AND CENTRAL BECAUSE

01:54:17.951 --> 01:54:19.052
WORKING WITH AGRICULTURAL

01:54:19.118 --> 01:54:21.154
FARMWORKERS. VERY CHALLENGING SO

01:54:21.221 --> 01:54:23.256
MANY CULTURAL BARRIERS THAT WE

01:54:23.323 --> 01:54:27.627
HAD TO- YOU KNOW. BREAK DOWN-

01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:28.861
YOU KNOW IT'S SO WHEN YOU TALK

ABOUT. YOU KNOW. WHAT WE'VE

01:54:31.397 --> 01:54:32.932
HEARD TODAY IN A RESOURCE.

01:54:32.999 --> 01:54:36.169
DESERT'S RESOURCE. CONSTRAINTS

01:54:36.236 --> 01:54:38.004
AND REALLY THE ALLOCATION OF

01:54:38.071 --> 01:54:41.674
RESOURCES. THROUGH THIS EQUITY

01:54:41.741 --> 01:54:43.643
LANDS. IS THIS IS BEST DONE BY

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.178
LEVERAGING OUR LOCAL AND

01:54:45.245 --> 01:54:47.013
REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AS HAS

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:51.084
BEEN DISCUSSED. AND IF SO- YOU

01:54:51.150 --> 01:54:53.152
KNOW WHAT ARE WAYS IN WHICH THE

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:54.053
STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:57.757
SUPPORT OUR LOCAL CBO'S

01:54:57.824 --> 01:54:59.892
NONPROFITS THE WORK YOU GUYS DO

01:54:59.959 --> 01:55:02.095
. BEYOND JUST INSURING THAT YOU

01:55:02.161 --> 01:55:03.930
HAVE RESOURCES AND YOU KNOW THE

01:55:03.997 --> 01:55:07.567
WAY OF MONEY AND- THE FINANCIAL

01:55:07.634 --> 01:55:08.134
RESOURCES IS THERE SOMETHING

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:10.903
ELSE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING- WHEN

01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:16.442
IT COMES TO THIS AREA OF SUPPORT. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUESTION

01:55:16.509 --> 01:55:19.846
SURE I CAN TAKE A STAB FIRST- NO

01:55:19.912 --> 01:55:21.281
PUN INTENDEDI DO VACCINATE ALL

01:55:21.347 --> 01:55:26.152
DAY. SO I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:55:26.219 --> 01:55:28.054
DECENTRALIZATION AND

01:55:28.121 --> 01:55:30.990
DEMOCRATIZATION ARE CRITICAL.

01:55:31.057 --> 01:55:33.159
CONCEPTS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO

01:55:33.226 --> 01:55:35.528
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO IMPLEMENT WE

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:36.963
CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO

01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:39.499
QUATERNARY. ACADEMIC MEDICAL

01:55:39.565 --> 01:55:41.768
MECCA AS AND OUR PATIENTS CAN'T

01:55:41.834 --> 01:55:43.136
GET THEIR THEIR SHUT OUT BUT

01:55:43.202 --> 01:55:44.337
THEY MAY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:55:44.404 --> 01:55:46.039
ACCESS THE SERVICES IN THEIR

01:55:46.105 --> 01:55:48.141
PUBLIC HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:50.276
THEIR SCHOOLS IN THEIR CHURCHES

01:55:50.343 --> 01:55:51.611
IN THEIR PARKS AND RACKS I

01:55:51.678 --> 01:55:53.246
REALLY THINK THAT THISCONCEPT

01:55:53.313 --> 01:55:56.115
OF HEALTH. IN EVERY POLICY NEEDS

01:55:56.182 --> 01:55:57.483
TO BE FURTHER EXTENDED TO REALLY

01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:59.152
HEALTH IN EVERY INSTITUTION

01:55:59.218 --> 01:56:00.720
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THERE

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:01.854
REALLY NEEDS TO BE A WAY TO

01:56:01.921 --> 01:56:03.222
ACCESS THAT SO NOT ONLY THE

01:56:03.289 --> 01:56:05.258
FINANCIAL RESOURCES. BUT TRULY

01:56:05.325 --> 01:56:07.460
CREATING BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND

01:56:07.527 --> 01:56:09.128
THE METAPHORICAL SPACE WHERE WE

01:56:09.195 --> 01:56:10.763
CAN REALLY TACKLE HEALTH AND

01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:12.365
NONTRADITIONAL HEALTH SETTINGS

01:56:12.432 --> 01:56:14.334
WILL GET US A LOT FURTHER AND IT

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.069
SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY EVENT SO

01:56:16.135 --> 01:56:17.970
THAT IN CRISIS THAT BECOMES

01:56:18.037 --> 01:56:21.074
TRULY YOU'RE A MEDIA. NETWORK TO

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:23.509
RUN THAT LAST MILE FIRST TO GET

01:56:23.576 --> 01:56:25.111
THOSE SHOTS IN ARMS IN THIS

01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:27.580
EXAMPLE THE PANDEMIC BUT REALLY

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:29.148
JUST LIKE THE AMERICORPS JUST

01:56:29.215 --> 01:56:31.751
LIKE OUR- YOU KNOW PEACE KEEPING

01:56:31.818 --> 01:56:33.486
MISSIONS DURING PEACEKEEPING

01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:34.821
TIMES WE CAN BE PLANTING TREES

01:56:34.887 --> 01:56:36.556
WE CAN BE DOING. THE GOOD WORK

01:56:36.622 --> 01:56:37.924
WE NEED TO DO BUT DURING CRISIS

01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:40.259
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADD ACTIVATE

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:41.661
AND PIVOT IN OUR COMMUNITY IS

01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:43.229
CAPABLE OF THAT AND I THINK

01:56:43.296 --> 01:56:44.364
THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO

01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:46.299
CONTINUE TO MESSAGES THAT PEOPLE

01:56:46.366 --> 01:56:47.500
SOMETIMES DON'T REALLY GIVE US

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:49.068
ENOUGH CREDIT TO KNOW. HOW MUCH

01:56:49.135 --> 01:56:50.670
WE CAN DO WHEN WE'RE TRUSTED WE

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:54.240
WANT TO BE GOOD STEWARDS TO OUR

01:56:54.307 --> 01:56:55.942
OWN PEOPLE OUR OWN COMMUNITIES.

01:56:56.008 --> 01:56:57.310

DELIVERY OF THE HEALTH SERVICES.

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:13.493
THEY DEPEND ON BUT IT'S

CERTAINLY IT'S JUST YOU KNOW.

01:57:15.428 --> 01:57:17.497
THE MODEL EXISTS BUT IT'S JUST

01:57:17.563 --> 01:57:21.033
HAVING THAT FLEXIBILITY TO DO IT

01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:21.601
IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE

01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:24.137
OBVIOUSLY. AND I JUST TOOK OF

01:57:24.203 --> 01:57:25.605
THAT AND I WILL GO BACK TO

01:57:25.671 --> 01:57:27.407

PANELISTS SAID THAT THE

01:57:28.508 --> 01:57:29.976
FLEXIBILITY BUT THEN I GO BACK

FOLLOW UP ON AS WELL. ABSOLUTELY

01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:22.762
SO EXCITED AS I MENTIONED

01:58:22.829 --> 01:58:25.398
EARLIER PARTICULARLY IN IN THE

01:58:25.465 --> 01:58:27.567
LONG BEACH AREA WHICH IS WHERE-

01:58:27.633 --> 01:58:28.901
WE FOCUS OUR OUR SERVICE

01:58:28.968 --> 01:58:32.772
DELIVERY. AT THE RATE AS I

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:34.373
MENTIONED EARLIER AND THE LATEST

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.375
REPORT WHICH IS FROM TWENTY

01:58:36.442 --> 01:58:37.176
NINETEEN S. YOU KNOW SOME OF

01:58:37.243 --> 01:58:39.946
THESE DATA IS THERE'S A DELAY IN

01:58:40.012 --> 01:58:42.248
GETTING THESE NUMBERS UT. BUT

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:45.451
WE IN LONG BEACH- AS OF TWENTY

01:58:45.518 --> 01:58:48.020
NINETEEN HAD TWICE THE RATE OF

01:58:48.087 --> 01:58:49.722
HIV INFECTIONS AS TO THE STATE

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:54.627

01:58:54.694 --> 01:58:55.228
HUNDRED THOUSAND ESTATE WAS AT

01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:56.662
THIRTEEN PER ONE HUNDRED. SO

01:58:56.729 --> 01:58:59.165
IT'S IS VERY LERMAN AGAIN LIKE

01:58:59.232 --> 01:59:00.933
TERRY SAID EARLIER HE CONTINUES

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.402
TO IMPACT YOUNG MEN WHO HAVE SEX

BROTHERS AND SISTERS AGAIN

01:59:13.679 --> 01:59:15.615
BECAUSE THEY DATA COLLECTION

01:59:15.681 --> 01:59:17.416
DOESN'T REALLY REFLECT WHO THEY

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:20.019
ARE SO SOMETIMESTHEY GET. PUT

01:59:20.086 --> 01:59:22.121
IN THE CATEGORY S. MAINLY SIX OF

01:59:22.188 --> 01:59:24.090
MAN WHEN IN FACT THIS KNOW WHO

01:59:24.156 --> 01:59:26.058
THEY ARE AS AN INDIVIDUAL SO

01:59:26.125 --> 01:59:29.629
THAT THERE'D BE A TRUE NUMBER IS

01:59:29.695 --> 01:59:30.229
A LITTLE UP SKEWER BECAUSE OF

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:31.631
THAT. ANY WE CONTINUE TO DO YOU

01:59:31.697 --> 01:59:33.299
KNOW THIS BY THE EFFORTS OF HIV

01:59:33.366 --> 01:59:35.067
TREATMENT WHICH WE KNOW IS VERY

01:59:35.134 --> 01:59:36.903
EFFECTIVE A PERSON CAN GET TO

01:59:36.969 --> 01:59:40.172
UNDETECTABLE. AND HAVE VERY VERY

01:59:40.239 --> 01:59:41.274
IF NOT ZERO CHANCE OF

01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:43.009
TRANSMITTING HIV VIA SEXUAL

01:59:43.075 --> 01:59:48.414
ACTIVITIES WE HAVE CRAP. BUT THE

01:59:48.481 --> 01:59:50.883
SERVICE DELIVERY HOW THE MESSAGE

01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:53.386
GET TO THE INDIVIDUAL IN THAT IN

01:59:53.452 --> 01:59:54.487
A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:57.623
WITH. Y. M. MY LIVED EXPERIENCE

01:59:57.690 --> 01:59:59.992
IS WILL I THINK THERE'S A

02:00:00.059 --> 02:00:02.094
CONTINUES TO BE A GAP AND OF

02:00:02.161 --> 02:00:05.064
COURSE. STI'S OR SEXUALLY

02:00:05.131 --> 02:00:06.232
TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS IS A

02:00:06.299 --> 02:00:08.334
PRETTY GOOD PREDICTOR IN MANY

02:00:08.401 --> 02:00:11.304
CASES OF A POTENTIAL HIV

02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:13.873
INFECTION SO. WE CONTINUE TO

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:16.242
HELP OUR TO DO IN THAT REGARD

02:00:16.309 --> 02:00:17.643
AND IT'S THIS THAT THEY SIX

02:00:17.710 --> 02:00:19.178
CONTINUE TO BE ALARMING

02:00:19.245 --> 02:00:21.247
UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT. WHAT WILL

02:00:21.314 --> 02:00:22.348
BE EMAILED TO ME YOU MADE

02:00:22.415 --> 02:00:23.616
MENTION OF IT BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:00:23.683 --> 02:00:25.451
PREPPING WE HAVE TAP AND IT

02:00:25.518 --> 02:00:27.119
SEEMS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD HAVE

02:00:27.186 --> 02:00:28.788
REDUCED THE RATE BUT YOU'RE

02:00:28.854 --> 02:00:32.224
SAYING THAT LONG BEACH IS- AS AS

02:00:32.291 --> 02:00:33.559
HIGH AS IT IS IN THE STATE OF

02:00:33.626 --> 02:00:35.595
CALIFORNIA. IN ITS TOTALITY SO

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:37.964
I'M ALARMED BY THAT BECAUSE

02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:39.165
AGAIN THE CAMPAIGN WAS GETTING

02:00:39.231 --> 02:00:41.500
TO ZERO- AND THERE WAS A LOT H.

02:00:41.567 --> 02:00:43.502
CATION BEING DONE AND FUNDING TO

02:00:43.569 --> 02:00:45.404
GO ALONG WITH THAT BUT WITH YOUR

02:00:45.471 --> 02:00:47.974
NUMBERS YEARS DISTRICTS. THAT WE

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:49.342
SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE ALARMED

02:00:49.408 --> 02:00:51.577
BECAUSE IS DOUBLE OR EQUAL TO

02:00:51.644 --> 02:00:54.380
CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL AFFECTION

02:00:54.447 --> 02:00:57.683
RATE AROUND HIV CORRECT AND SO

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:59.251
AGAIN I GO BACK TO THE

02:00:59.318 --> 02:01:00.519
INTENTIONALITY RICE SO WE

02:01:00.586 --> 02:01:02.321
GETTING TO ZERO WHO'S GETTING

02:01:02.388 --> 02:01:04.123
THAT MESSAGE AND IN WHAT CONTEXT

02:01:04.190 --> 02:01:06.058
RIGHT BECAUSE- THEY CAMPAIGN CAN

02:01:06.125 --> 02:01:07.526
BE FANTASTIC I THINK I HAVE ALL

02:01:07.593 --> 02:01:09.295
THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES. BUT

02:01:09.362 --> 02:01:10.363
IF THAT MESSAGE DOESN'T GET TO

02:01:10.429 --> 02:01:11.564
ME IN A WAY THAT I CAN

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:13.232
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS

02:01:13.299 --> 02:01:18.270
APPLICABLE TO MY LIFE. THE POINT

02:01:18.337 --> 02:01:19.939
RIGHT. IS IT'S POINTLESS. RIGHT

02:01:20.006 --> 02:01:21.507
MAP IF I TRANSIT PERSON WHO'S

02:01:21.574 --> 02:01:24.143
HOMELESS WHO'S FOOD INSECURE WHO

02:01:26.412 --> 02:01:29.649
HOUSING DO I CARE ABOUT PREP

02:01:29.715 --> 02:01:32.518
PROBABLY NOT. I CARE ABOUT IS

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:35.154

I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO- DR- THE

02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:22.294
BALL- WITH RESPECT TO THE-

02:03:22.361 --> 02:03:24.296
GOVERNOR JUST CAME OUT WITH.

02:03:24.363 --> 02:03:26.298
INTEREST AND RUBIO THAT THERE'S

02:03:26.365 --> 02:03:27.500
GONNA BE A THIRTY ONE BILLION

02:03:27.566 --> 02:03:31.036
DOLLARS A SURPLUS- IN THE STATE

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:34.240
AND IF YOU HAD TEN BILLION OF

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:36.108
THE THIRTY ONE BILLION. HOW

02:03:36.175 --> 02:03:37.643
WOULD YOU DIRECT THOSE RESOURCES

02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:42.648
AND WHY. THANK YOU I LOVE THIS

02:03:42.715 --> 02:03:45.217
QUESTION AND THIS OPPORTUNITY-

02:03:45.284 --> 02:03:46.285
SO FIRST I WANT TO CONTEXTUALIZE

02:03:46.352 --> 02:03:48.020
MY RESPONSE AND I WANT TO KNOW

02:03:48.087 --> 02:03:50.289
THAT OUR CHILDREN RIGHT NOW ARE

02:03:50.356 --> 02:03:52.024
SLATED TO HAVE A LOWER LIFE

02:03:52.091 --> 02:03:54.894
EXPECTANCY THAN THEIR PARENTS.

02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:56.662
AND THAT REALLY DEMONSTRATES FOR

02:03:56.729 --> 02:03:57.930
US THAT WE'RE SLIPPING BACKWARDS

02:03:57.997 --> 02:03:59.765
IN TERMS OF SOCIAL AND HEALTH

02:03:59.832 --> 02:04:01.867
PROGRESS AND THAT OUR CURRENT

02:04:01.934 --> 02:04:03.903
SYSTEMS ARE FAILING US IN TERMS

02:04:03.969 --> 02:04:06.205
OF HEALTH EQUITY. AND SO THIS IS

02:04:06.272 --> 02:04:07.973
THE PRODUCT OF MULTIPLE CRISES

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:09.875
THE PANDEMIC CERTAINLY POLLUTED

02:04:09.942 --> 02:04:11.777
WATER AS WAS MENTIONED WILDFIRES

02:04:11.844 --> 02:04:13.946
PEOPLE CAN'T BREED RACIAL

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:15.214
VIOLENCE THERE ARE MULTIPLE

02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:17.349
PANDEMICS THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING

02:04:17.416 --> 02:04:19.718
WITH DAY IN AND DAY OUT. AND SO

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:22.221
THIS IS A MOMENT TO SHIFT FROM

02:04:22.288 --> 02:04:23.355
THINKING ABOUT INCREMENTAL

02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:26.292
CHANGE OR REACTIONARY APPROACHES

02:04:26.358 --> 02:04:27.960
TO TRANSFORMATIVECHANGE TOO

02:04:28.027 --> 02:04:29.061
DEEP AND LASTING FUNDAMENTAL

02:04:29.128 --> 02:04:31.831
CHANGE AND TO GO TO GET THERE WE

02:04:31.897 --> 02:04:34.099
REALLY NEED TO BE INVESTING IN

02:04:34.166 --> 02:04:35.734
HISTORICALLY OPPRESSED GROUPS

02:04:35.801 --> 02:04:37.169
AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE AT

02:04:37.236 --> 02:04:39.038
THE CENTER OF DESIGNING AND

02:04:39.104 --> 02:04:41.240
IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS TO THESE

02:04:41.307 --> 02:04:43.142
ISSUES. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE

02:04:43.209 --> 02:04:44.410
SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE AT

02:04:44.476 --> 02:04:46.545
THE TABLE AND ARE EMPOWERED TO

02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:47.847
SHARE THEIR VISIONS AND

02:04:47.913 --> 02:04:49.915
SOLUTIONS TO THESE ISSUES WE ARE

02:04:49.982 --> 02:04:52.117
THE CARETAKERS FROM THEIR WORLD

02:04:52.184 --> 02:04:54.119
AND WE CAN BE LISTENING TO THEM-

02:04:54.186 --> 02:04:55.154
AND LEANING ON THEM FOR THESE

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:57.089
SOLUTIONS. AND THIS PROCESS

02:04:57.156 --> 02:04:58.691

OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE BEING

02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:27.112
LEFT BEHIND IF HISTORICALLY BEEN

02:11:27.179 --> 02:11:31.016

YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AND I DO

02:11:49.134 --> 02:11:49.768
LIKE THE IDEA OF BRINGING

02:11:49.835 --> 02:11:51.003
MULTIPLE CAUCUSES TOGETHER ON

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:52.871
THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE- SO THANK

YOU FOR THAT GIVE ME TIME TO

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:57.442
NOODLE ON THE- HOW. WE CAN

02:11:57.509 --> 02:11:59.244
ENSURE THAT CLINIC ASSOCIATION

02:11:59.311 --> 02:12:01.046
CLINICS ARE LEFT OUT IN FUTURE

02:12:01.113 --> 02:12:03.982
PANDEMIC- I AGAIN I'M FEELING

02:12:04.049 --> 02:12:05.350
HEARTENED BY THE POSITION THAT

02:12:05.417 --> 02:12:06.752
C. C. A. L. A. C. THE CLINICS IN

02:12:06.818 --> 02:12:09.054
LOS ANGELES OR IN A RELATION TO

02:12:09.121 --> 02:12:10.489
OUR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH

02:12:10.555 --> 02:12:11.490
DEPARTMENT IN OUR COUNTY HEALTH

02:12:11.556 --> 02:12:13.525
SERVICES. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN

02:12:13.592 --> 02:12:15.427
BETTER SHAPE IN MY CONCERN IS

02:12:15.494 --> 02:12:16.895
PROBABLY MORE BROADLY FOCUSED ON

02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:18.697
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE I

02:12:18.764 --> 02:12:19.631
KNOW MY COLLEAGUES IN OTHER

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:21.667
REGIONS DON'T HAVE THE KINDS OF

02:12:21.733 --> 02:12:23.969
RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH

02:12:24.036 --> 02:12:25.103
OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS

02:12:25.170 --> 02:12:28.006
HERE IN LA- IF I WAS LOOKING AT

02:12:28.073 --> 02:12:29.207
PIECES THAT CONCERNED ME

02:12:29.274 --> 02:12:31.677
THINKING GOING FORWARD WITH THE

02:12:31.743 --> 02:12:33.011
NEXT PANDEMIC LOOKS LIKE. I

02:12:33.078 --> 02:12:34.579
WOULD BE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED AND

02:12:34.646 --> 02:12:35.447
CURIOUS HOW WE MIGHT

02:12:35.514 --> 02:12:36.448
INSTITUTIONALIZE THE

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:38.116
RELATIONSHIP WITH PUBLIC HEALTH

02:12:38.183 --> 02:12:39.985
IN REGARDS TO. YOU KNOW PANDEMIC

02:12:40.052 --> 02:12:41.853
PLANNING. WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.322
REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH A

02:12:43.388 --> 02:12:45.090
LOT OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE

02:12:45.157 --> 02:12:46.024
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

02:12:46.091 --> 02:12:47.626
RIGHT NOW. BUT HOW DOES THAT

02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:48.627
RELATIONSHIP GET TO THE

02:12:48.694 --> 02:12:49.828
INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL SO THAT YOU

02:12:49.895 --> 02:12:51.963
KNOW IF WE HAVE TURNED OVER AND

02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:52.597
THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE NO LONGER

02:12:52.664 --> 02:12:54.433
THERE. DID IT DOES THE

02:12:54.499 --> 02:12:55.400
RELATIONSHIP FLOUNDER A LITTLE

02:12:55.467 --> 02:12:57.202
BIT- SO THAT'S SOMETHING ON MY

02:12:57.269 --> 02:12:58.503
MIND AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY

02:12:58.570 --> 02:12:59.504
ON THE MIND OF LOTS OF FOLKS

02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:00.839
LOOKING FORWARD- AT MY

02:13:00.906 --> 02:13:03.375
ORGANIZATION. YOU KNOW WE RUN AN

02:13:03.442 --> 02:13:04.743
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WE

02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:06.111
DO WORK CLOSELY HISTORICALLY

02:13:06.178 --> 02:13:07.479
WHAT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

02:13:07.546 --> 02:13:08.947
WE WORK WITH PUBLIC HEALTH FUND.

02:13:09.014 --> 02:13:11.783
YOU KNOW AS- IS- AND HIV BUT

02:13:11.850 --> 02:13:13.685
THIS ISSUE OF PANDEMIC PLANNING

02:13:13.752 --> 02:13:16.722
FEELS. FRESHER NEWER TO US- SO

02:13:16.788 --> 02:13:17.556
YEAH REALLY MAKING SURE THAT

02:13:17.622 --> 02:13:19.091
THAT'S PART OF. EMERGENCY

02:13:19.157 --> 02:13:20.926
PLANNING THAT IT'S NOT JUST

02:13:20.992 --> 02:13:22.160
EARTHQUAKES TERRORIST EVENTS

02:13:22.227 --> 02:13:23.128
SOME OF THINGS THAT WERE

02:13:23.195 --> 02:13:29.534
INCLUDED. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS-

02:13:29.601 --> 02:13:30.869
FOR ME I WAS RUNNING AROUND MY

02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:31.903
TEAM WAS RUNNING AROUND LIKE A

02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:33.638
CHICKEN WITH ITS HEAD CUT OFF.

02:13:33.705 --> 02:13:35.907
WE WORK OF HUSTLING- WE WERE

02:13:35.974 --> 02:13:38.510
BEGGING FOR PP- COUNTY

02:13:38.577 --> 02:13:39.678
UNIVERSITY MINGUS HILLS THE

02:13:39.745 --> 02:13:42.147
STUDENTS WERE MAKING A MASK AND

02:13:42.214 --> 02:13:45.717
WE I PURCHASED- FIVE HUNDRED-

02:13:45.784 --> 02:13:47.619
MASS I'M VERY GRATEFUL THESE ARE

02:13:47.686 --> 02:13:50.222
THE SCHEELS SCHEELS- THAT THE

02:13:50.288 --> 02:13:51.890
STUDENTS HERE CASSIDY UNIVERSUM

02:13:51.957 --> 02:13:52.858
IN HIS HEELS ARE MAKING ON A

02:13:52.924 --> 02:13:55.327
DAILY BASIS. AND I TOOK THOSE MY

02:13:55.394 --> 02:13:56.962
TEAM TOOK THOSE WITH PP

02:13:57.028 --> 02:13:58.463
EQUIPMENT AND- FACE MASKS

02:13:58.530 --> 02:13:59.664
DANCING WE TOOK THOSE TO

02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:01.199
CLINICS. IN THE HEIGHT OF THE

02:14:01.266 --> 02:14:03.101
PANDEMIC. I DON'T WANT TO GO

02:14:03.168 --> 02:14:04.970
BACK TO THAT AGAIN. YOU SHOULD

02:14:05.036 --> 02:14:07.506
NOT HAVE TO- DOCTOR HEALTHCARE

02:14:07.572 --> 02:14:09.141
PROFESSION SHOULD NOT HAVE TO.

02:14:09.207 --> 02:14:11.042
IN THE FIFTH WORLD ECONOMY

02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:13.044
DAMMIT WEAR THE SAME UNIFORM

02:14:13.111 --> 02:14:15.781
OVER AND OVER AGAIN- WHILE

02:14:15.847 --> 02:14:17.449
TRYING TO SERVICE. I'M IN THE

02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:19.985
MIDST OF A PANDEMIC- I WAS VERY

02:14:20.051 --> 02:14:21.787
DISHEARTENED BY THAT- I KNOW

02:14:21.853 --> 02:14:23.188
THAT THIS IS OUR FIRST TIME

02:14:23.255 --> 02:14:25.223
BEING IN SUCH A PANDEMIC. SO

02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:26.625
THERE'S NO ROAD MAP IN TERMS OF

02:14:26.691 --> 02:14:28.360
WHAT WE NEED TO DO I WAS BY

02:14:28.427 --> 02:14:29.628
TRIAL AND ERROR I DO WANNA TRY

02:14:29.694 --> 02:14:32.297
THAT NO MORE. I SAID NORMAL.

02:14:32.364 --> 02:14:35.100
OKAY SO. WE NEED TO IS THERE A

02:14:35.167 --> 02:14:36.835
PLAN IN PLACE FOR CLINICS MOVING

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:39.004
FORWARD BECAUSE A WHAT JUST

02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:41.506
TRANSPIRED ON THE NEWS- WITH

02:14:41.573 --> 02:14:45.510
THIS NEW VARIANTS. I DON'T KNOW

02:14:45.577 --> 02:14:46.311
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF IT

02:14:46.378 --> 02:14:49.247
. GLOBAL ON THE CALL. THAT ONE

02:14:49.314 --> 02:14:52.784
OKAY. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:14:52.851 --> 02:14:54.219
THAT IT THIS IS CREEP INTO OUR

02:14:54.286 --> 02:14:55.587
RICK THAT WE HOW TO HAVE IT AND

02:14:55.654 --> 02:14:58.924
MY CONCERN A- THAT THE CLINICS.

02:14:58.990 --> 02:15:00.625
HAS COMMUNICATED WITH KNOWLEDGE

02:15:00.692 --> 02:15:02.360
COUNTY HEALTH OF DEPARTMENTS BUT

02:15:02.427 --> 02:15:04.563
THE STATE AS WELL TO MAKING SURE

02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:07.265
THAT THIS IS THE BLUEPRINT BASED

02:15:07.332 --> 02:15:08.700
ON OUR PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE THAT

02:15:08.767 --> 02:15:10.202
IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS

02:15:10.268 --> 02:15:11.403
THAT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO

02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:13.371
IMMEDIATELY IS THAT SOMETHING

02:15:13.438 --> 02:15:17.342
THAT EXISTS. I DO BELIEVE IT'S

02:15:17.409 --> 02:15:20.145
IF NOT FULLY FLESHED OUT- IN

02:15:20.212 --> 02:15:20.812
BETTER SHAPE THAN IT WAS

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:22.380
PREVIOUSLY- I SAID OUR

02:15:22.447 --> 02:15:23.682
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE COUNTY FOR

02:15:23.748 --> 02:15:25.784
DISTRIBUTION OF PP WALL ROCKY AT

02:15:25.851 --> 02:15:30.889
FIRST AND LARGELY. THAT WAS

02:15:30.956 --> 02:15:31.490
BECAUSE THE COUNTY DIDN'T HAVE

02:15:31.556 --> 02:15:32.457
IT TO DISTRIBUTE- ONCE THEY DID

02:15:32.524 --> 02:15:34.092
IS JUST IN PLACE WHEREBY GOT.

02:15:34.159 --> 02:15:35.093
FOR THE COUNT WE JUST THAT TO

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:37.295
MEMBERS. AND MEMBER- CLINICS

02:15:37.362 --> 02:15:38.864
ALSO GET P. P. DIRECTLY FROM THE

02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:40.432
COUNTY. BUT THERE IS A BIG

02:15:40.499 --> 02:15:42.033
CHALLENGE IN A BOTTLE NECK WAS

02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:43.969
THAT WE RENTED STORAGE UNITS THE

02:15:44.035 --> 02:15:46.538
CLINIC ASSOCIATION. RESTORE PP

02:15:46.605 --> 02:15:48.373
SO IT STARTED FLOWING IN BUT

02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.509
CLINICS DON'T HAVE THE PHYSICAL

02:15:50.575 --> 02:15:53.111
INFRASTRUCTURE TO STORE THREE OR

02:15:53.178 --> 02:15:54.579
SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR WORTH OF PP

02:15:54.646 --> 02:15:56.748
ON SITE- AND THAT'S A VERY THAT

02:15:56.815 --> 02:15:58.283
I THINK. STILL NEEDS TO BE

02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:59.684
OVERCOME IN LOOKING FORWARD AND

02:15:59.751 --> 02:16:01.052
THINKING ABOUT FUTURE PANDEMICS

02:16:01.119 --> 02:16:02.554
IS THAT THEY OPERATE ON SUCH

02:16:02.621 --> 02:16:04.523
TIGHT MARGINS AND SPACE IS AT A

02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:06.191
PREMIUM AND THEN A LATE. SPACE

02:16:06.258 --> 02:16:08.527
COST A FORTUNE- AND HAVING THAT

02:16:08.593 --> 02:16:10.662
TYPE OF STORAGE PROVED A VERY

02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:12.664
SEVERE LIMITATION- AND YOU ARE

02:16:12.731 --> 02:16:14.132
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT YOU DON'T.

02:16:14.199 --> 02:16:16.134
SEE CLEC RENTING A STORAGE UNIT

02:16:16.201 --> 02:16:17.402
IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD LONG TERM

02:16:17.469 --> 02:16:19.170
SOLUTION IN THINKING ABOUT

02:16:19.237 --> 02:16:23.241
FUTURE PANDEMIC PLANNING-ABSOLUTELY. ADD TO THAT PLEASE

02:16:23.308 --> 02:16:24.843
BUT I DON'T. GT THIS ONE TO ADD

02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:29.347
A CUP QUICK COM. BUT YOUR- WHO

02:16:29.414 --> 02:16:32.651
THAT ONLINE. SORRY MONEY TO

02:16:32.717 --> 02:16:35.287
START OF THE WAY BUT I'M GOING

02:16:35.353 --> 02:16:45.163
TO ENOUGH I CAN THE WATER. ONE

02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:47.132
FIVE I DIDN'T GET ANY TO BE YOU

02:16:47.198 --> 02:16:50.368
WHY. NOT PROVIDED THERE ANYTHING

02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:53.738
ALL THE BACK ON THE LARGE. ALL

02:16:53.805 --> 02:16:57.375
IN ONE. WONDERS WHO AND IS FOR

02:16:57.442 --> 02:17:00.345
THE STATE. YOU HAVE NOT ONLY A-

02:17:00.412 --> 02:17:03.548
DIVISIONS AT. IT AT HOME. THAT

02:17:03.615 --> 02:17:07.752
ASKED THE LOCAL CAN ON LAW OUT.

02:17:07.819 --> 02:17:10.155
SO IF YOU HAVE A WHERE HOW. YOU

02:17:10.221 --> 02:17:14.392
KNOW WE ALL PD AND IN THE THAT

02:17:14.459 --> 02:17:17.295
TO OUR DATA. WORKERS OF THE OR

02:17:17.362 --> 02:17:20.932
GET A IT ON THE OF DIDN'T ROW.

02:17:20.999 --> 02:17:23.201
THE ENVIRONMENTAL THE DAY WITH

02:17:23.268 --> 02:17:26.237
NOT A- THAT'S ONE. WE HAD A

02:17:26.304 --> 02:17:29.407
LITTLE AND- LOT ANGELES COUNTY-

02:17:29.474 --> 02:17:30.342
WE DON'T HAVE THE BILL TO DO

02:17:30.408 --> 02:17:32.310
THAT AMONG. THAT IS ONE WAY TO

02:17:32.377 --> 02:17:34.212
CONSIDER PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE TO

02:17:34.279 --> 02:17:36.047
UPDATE AND SURE TO CONDITION WE

02:17:36.114 --> 02:17:39.184
WERE OKAY- IN OUR- WHO'S ALWAYS

02:17:39.250 --> 02:17:54.466
FRESH. THE TWILIGHT ZONE YOU

02:17:54.532 --> 02:17:55.333
KNOW IS THIS REALLY THE

02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:57.268
WEALTHIEST COUNTRY THAT YOU KNOW

02:17:57.335 --> 02:18:01.039
FIRST WHATEVER. ICONOMI AND SO-

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:02.073
SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS REALLY

02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:03.174
IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE

02:18:03.241 --> 02:18:04.743
SELECT COMMITTEE IS FOCUSED ON

02:18:04.809 --> 02:18:06.444
INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN ADDITION

02:18:06.511 --> 02:18:10.882
TO HIV. HEPATITIS AND S. T. EYES

02:18:10.949 --> 02:18:13.118
WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE PANDEMICS

02:18:13.184 --> 02:18:16.554
LIKE CORONAVIRUS- YOU KNOW WHAT

02:18:16.621 --> 02:18:17.389
ROLE DOES THE STATE OF

02:18:17.455 --> 02:18:19.257
CALIFORNIA PLAYED NOW AS A

02:18:19.324 --> 02:18:21.393
NATION AND WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT

02:18:21.459 --> 02:18:24.429
THE- AN- EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF

02:18:24.496 --> 02:18:26.731
RESOURCES GLOBALLY. KNOWING THAT

02:18:26.798 --> 02:18:28.700
IT DOES HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT

02:18:28.767 --> 02:18:31.069
HERE AT IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT

02:18:31.136 --> 02:18:32.337
IS HAPPENING IN SUB SAHARAN

02:18:32.404 --> 02:18:33.672
AFRICA RIGHT NOW WITH THE SOUTH

02:18:33.738 --> 02:18:36.107
AFRICAN VARIANT IF AFRICA DOES

02:18:36.174 --> 02:18:37.642
NOT GET ACCESS TO VACCINES THERE

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:39.344
WILL BE ANOTHER MUTATION AND IT

02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:40.679

02:18:40.745 --> 02:18:42.714
WILL COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA SO.

02:18:42.781 --> 02:18:44.082
I THINK THERE HAS TO BE PRESSURE

02:18:44.149 --> 02:18:44.983
APPLIED TO THE FEDERAL

02:18:45.050 --> 02:18:46.351

EXPERIENCED. I'VE COME TO

02:20:40.265 --> 02:20:42.801

NEEDS ARE REFUGEES. I THOUGHT

02:20:52.043 --> 02:20:54.045
THAT ONE OF THE PASTORS IN

02:20:54.112 --> 02:20:56.781

THE OPPRESSION OF THE EXPERIENCE

02:21:04.289 --> 02:21:05.590
THERE THEREFORE ONE OF THE

02:21:05.657 --> 02:21:08.426
THINGS THAT WE MUST INVEST IN.

02:21:08.493 --> 02:21:10.662
IS TRAUMA INFORMED CARE FOR OUR

02:21:10.728 --> 02:21:13.498

YOU HAD TO CLEAN IT THAT THEY

02:21:27.679 --> 02:21:31.249
WERE. LATINO OR MEXICAN SO THAT

02:21:31.316 --> 02:21:32.984
THEIR VILLAGES THAT ARE

TO ADDRESS THE GLOBAL PHARMA.

02:21:47.599 --> 02:21:49.100
BECAUSE WITHOUT THE PROBLEM

FULLY RECOVER AS A COMMUNITY I

02:21:54.973 --> 02:21:57.175
HOPE THAT THAT KIND OF MAKES

02:21:57.242 --> 02:21:59.978
SENSE I THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE

02:22:00.044 --> 02:22:03.147

NEEDS THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF

02:22:29.207 --> 02:22:30.541
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. WE WILL

02:22:30.608 --> 02:22:34.212
DEVELOP A HOSPITAL IN THOSE

02:22:34.279 --> 02:22:37.548
AREAS THAT WE YOU. NEED HIGHER

02:22:37.615 --> 02:22:39.384
LEVELS OF CARE. WE DON'T HAVE

02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:43.154
ANY Q. AND SOUTH LA. YEAH WE

02:22:43.221 --> 02:22:45.290
HAVE THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATE

02:22:45.356 --> 02:22:51.429
OF INCIDENCE. COUNTY WE DO NOT

02:22:51.496 --> 02:22:53.164

IN SOUTH PHILLY YEAH WE HAVE THE

02:22:56.267 --> 02:22:58.503
HIGHEST MORTALITY RATES. MORE WE

02:22:58.569 --> 02:23:00.305
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH

02:23:00.371 --> 02:23:03.207
OUR CLINIC SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE

02:23:03.274 --> 02:23:05.443
. YOU KNOW ACCESS TO THE

02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:07.245
HOSPITAL IS SO HARD TO GET

02:23:07.312 --> 02:23:09.247
SOMEONE INTO A HOSPITAL AND HOW

02:23:09.314 --> 02:23:12.183
THE ADMITTING PRIVILEGES. WITH

02:23:12.250 --> 02:23:14.752
THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

02:23:14.819 --> 02:23:17.155
. MORE ONE OF THE IDEAS I HAVE

02:23:17.221 --> 02:23:19.190
WITH THIS TEN BILLION SB DO IT

02:23:19.257 --> 02:23:21.092
ALL THE TEN MILLION THIS IS ALL

02:23:21.159 --> 02:23:23.428
IN FEW KEY SAFETY TOOLS B. R.

02:23:23.494 --> 02:23:25.396
INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE TRAINED

02:23:25.463 --> 02:23:28.066

NALOXONE. SO AGAIN WE HAVE

02:23:34.472 --> 02:23:37.375
STRATEGIES THAT CAN WORK WE CAN

02:23:37.442 --> 02:23:39.344
TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES. AND I

02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:40.945

WE I HEARD IT A LITTLE BIT HERE

BUT YOU BROUGHT IT HOME. AND

02:24:27.592 --> 02:24:30.561
THAT'S THE TRAUMA- THIS PANDEMIC

02:24:30.628 --> 02:24:31.562
HAS MISSED A WHOLE BUNCH OF

02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:33.731
PEOPLE UP- WITH YOUR HEALTHCARE

02:24:33.798 --> 02:24:38.269
PROFESSIONAL OR NOT WHERE THE

02:24:38.336 --> 02:24:40.304
DIFFERENCE I THINK WE ALL SUFFER

02:24:40.371 --> 02:24:42.907
FROM SOME FORM OF TRAUMA- AND

02:24:42.974 --> 02:24:45.043
RESOURCES GOING IN THAT AREA IS

02:24:45.109 --> 02:24:48.413
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- I'M GOING

02:24:48.479 --> 02:24:50.114
IN IN THE IN THIS SPACE SO.

02:24:50.181 --> 02:24:51.916
SOMEBODY MAY WANT TO ALSO TOUCH

02:24:51.983 --> 02:24:53.317
BASES ON THAT BUT I'LL GO TO

02:24:53.384 --> 02:24:55.386
DOCTOR ABRAHAM WHAT ARE SOME OF

02:24:55.453 --> 02:24:58.156
THE NEW THE NEWS- YOU ARE

02:24:58.222 --> 02:25:00.892
HEARING OR ON THE GROUND OF AS

02:25:00.958 --> 02:25:02.093
IT RELATES TO VACCINE

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:04.529
DISTRIBUTION- WHAT ELSE IS

02:25:04.595 --> 02:25:06.464
NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITY TO

02:25:06.531 --> 02:25:09.801
ADDRESS- THE LACK OF RESOURCES

02:25:09.867 --> 02:25:11.869
IN OUR COMMUNITY. SURE I'LL

02:25:11.936 --> 02:25:13.805
START BY JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU

02:25:13.871 --> 02:25:15.039
KNOW DR YOUNG AND I'VE WORKED

02:25:15.106 --> 02:25:15.606
TOGETHER IN THE PAST WE'VE

02:25:15.673 --> 02:25:17.175
WORKED SPECIFICALLY ON VACCINES

02:25:17.241 --> 02:25:19.110
WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY I MEAN THIS

02:25:19.177 --> 02:25:20.411
REALLY GOES TO SHOW WE ARE ALL

02:25:20.478 --> 02:25:22.246
IN THIS TOGETHER SO MANY OF US

02:25:22.313 --> 02:25:23.247
HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED TOGETHER IN

02:25:23.314 --> 02:25:24.482
MANY DIFFERENT CAPACITIES.

02:25:24.549 --> 02:25:26.084
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SO THAT

02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:27.452
NETWORK IS THAT POWERFUL AND

02:25:27.518 --> 02:25:29.554
STRONG IF ONLY WE HAD THE

02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:31.355
RESOURCES AND INVESTMENT- BUT I

02:25:31.422 --> 02:25:32.690
WILL SAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:25:32.757 --> 02:25:35.493
STRUCTURALLY. WE CAN DO TO

02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:37.395
IMPROVE OUTCOMES AS I THINK WE

02:25:37.462 --> 02:25:38.796
HAVE TO APPROACH HEALTH AS A

02:25:38.863 --> 02:25:41.365
CONTINUUM AND THAT CONTINUE MUST

02:25:41.432 --> 02:25:45.203
INCLUDE PRIMARY CARE. AS ONE OF

02:25:45.269 --> 02:25:46.838
ITS FOUNDATIONS ALONG WITH

02:25:46.904 --> 02:25:48.840
MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

02:25:48.906 --> 02:25:50.408
ALONG WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND

02:25:50.475 --> 02:25:53.311
RIGHT NOW THOSE SILOS ARE ALSO

02:25:53.377 --> 02:25:54.979
DESTRUCTIVE THERE COME WE'RE

02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:56.547
COMPETING INTERESTS RIGHT NOW

02:25:56.614 --> 02:25:58.683
AND THAT'S- TROUBLESOME BECAUSE

02:25:58.750 --> 02:26:00.485
WE REALLY NEED TO APPROACH THIS.

02:26:00.551 --> 02:26:03.287
AS HEALTH A CONTINUUM AND THAT

02:26:03.354 --> 02:26:04.422
NEEDS TO INCLUDE PRIMARY

02:26:04.489 --> 02:26:05.923
SECONDARY TERTIARY QUATERNARY

02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:07.725
CARE BUT ALSO EVERYTHING WE'VE

02:26:07.792 --> 02:26:12.697
DONE TO COMPARTMENTALIZE MENTAL

02:26:12.763 --> 02:26:13.297
HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE ADDICTION

02:26:13.364 --> 02:26:13.831
AND ALL THIS. DETERMINE

02:26:13.898 --> 02:26:15.032
INCLUDING HOUSING. AND THEN THE

02:26:15.099 --> 02:26:16.734
PUBLIC HEALTH PEACE AND WE SEE

02:26:16.801 --> 02:26:17.902
THAT FRAGMENTATION HERE IN THE

02:26:17.969 --> 02:26:19.904
COUNTY THAT EXIST IN THE STATE.

02:26:19.971 --> 02:26:21.072
AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:26:21.139 --> 02:26:22.306
TYPES OF BITING STRUCTURAL

02:26:22.373 --> 02:26:24.709
BARRIERS IF WE CAN FIND WAYS TO

02:26:24.775 --> 02:26:27.145
MOVE. FURTHER AND RESOURCE

02:26:27.211 --> 02:26:29.213
ALLOCATION BETWEEN THOSE SILOS

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.615
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HELPED US A

02:26:30.681 --> 02:26:32.617
LOT SOONER DURING THE PANDEMIC.

02:26:32.683 --> 02:26:34.051
OF AS FAR AS THE VACCINES WHERE

02:26:34.118 --> 02:26:35.353
DO WE GO FROM HERE I MEAN IT'S A

02:26:35.419 --> 02:26:37.321
TOUGH THING TO SAY EVERY DAY

02:26:37.388 --> 02:26:38.589
WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:26:38.656 --> 02:26:40.324
PEOPLE EVERYDAY PEOPLE. ARE

02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:41.993
STRUGGLING TO CHOOSE VACCINES

02:26:42.059 --> 02:26:44.095
FOR THEMSELVES THEIR CHILDREN.

02:26:44.162 --> 02:26:45.863
NOW WITH THIS OMICRON VARIANT

02:26:45.930 --> 02:26:47.565
WE'RE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE

02:26:47.632 --> 02:26:49.100
AFRAID ABOUT SHOULD I GET A

02:26:49.167 --> 02:26:50.868
BOOSTER NOW OR WAIT UNTIL AND

02:26:50.935 --> 02:26:52.970
NEXT GENERATION. VACCINE IS

02:26:53.037 --> 02:26:55.072
DEVELOPED WE REALLY HAVE TO SAY

02:26:55.139 --> 02:26:55.873
LOUD AND CLEAR IF YOU HAVEN'T

02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:57.175
GOTTEN YOUR FIRST OR SECOND

02:26:57.241 --> 02:26:58.609
DOES. PLEASE GO GET VACCINATED

02:26:58.676 --> 02:27:00.578
NOW WE REALLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE

02:27:00.645 --> 02:27:02.246
OVER EIGHTEEN TO PLEASE GO GET A

02:27:02.313 --> 02:27:04.348
BOOSTER RIGHT OW. I BELIEVE

02:27:04.415 --> 02:27:06.384
THAT THE MANUFACTURERS WELL LOOK

02:27:06.450 --> 02:27:08.319
AT NEXT GENERATION VACCINES

02:27:08.386 --> 02:27:10.054
ESPECIALLY IF WE REALIZE THAT

02:27:10.121 --> 02:27:11.989
HOME ACROSS ON. THE ESCAPE RISK

02:27:12.056 --> 02:27:13.691
IS HIGH AND THESE VACCINES ARE

02:27:13.758 --> 02:27:16.194
NOT AS EFFECTIVE WE WILL HAVE TO

02:27:16.260 --> 02:27:17.328
CHANGE OUR STRATEGY BUT WE HAVE

02:27:17.395 --> 02:27:19.597
LEARNED SO MUCH IN THE LAST

02:27:19.664 --> 02:27:20.231
FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MONTHS THAT WE

02:27:20.298 --> 02:27:22.166
WILL NOT HAVE TO GO. TO THE DARK

02:27:22.233 --> 02:27:24.335
DAYS OF MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AND

02:27:24.402 --> 02:27:25.703
GO DOWN THAT SHUT DOWN THE ROAD

02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:27.238
SO I APPLAUD ALL THE MEASURES

02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:29.106
THE STATE HAS TAKEN. THE COUNTY

02:27:29.173 --> 02:27:30.441
L. A. U. S. D. WITH THEIR

02:27:30.508 --> 02:27:32.210
VACCINE MANDATES THESE ARE ALL

02:27:32.276 --> 02:27:34.145
THE STEPS THESE ARE THE LAYERING

02:27:34.212 --> 02:27:36.147
STEPS THAT KEEP US SAFE AND WHEN

02:27:36.214 --> 02:27:37.915
WE DO THOSE THINGS. WE CAN KEEP

02:27:37.982 --> 02:27:39.350
OUR ECONOMIES OPEN WE CAN SEND

02:27:39.417 --> 02:27:40.918
OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL WE CAN GET

02:27:40.985 --> 02:27:42.220
BACK TO DOING ALL THOSE THINGS

02:27:42.286 --> 02:27:44.355
THAT WE MISS DOING FOR FIFTEEN.

02:27:44.422 --> 02:27:45.923
TO TWENTY MONTHS SO YES GET BACK

02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:47.858
SAY CONTINUE TO WEAR MASKS

02:27:47.925 --> 02:27:49.460
SOCIAL DISTANCE HAND HYGIENE

02:27:49.527 --> 02:27:51.162
THAT'S ALL PART OF IT BUT OF

02:27:51.229 --> 02:27:52.363
COURSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THIS

02:27:52.430 --> 02:27:54.131
MOMENT WE'RE GOING TO WATCH VERY

02:27:54.198 --> 02:27:55.533
CLOSELY. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:57.335
THIS PARTICULAR VARIANT HOW

02:27:57.401 --> 02:27:58.769
CONCERNING IS THAT THEIR FIFTY

02:27:58.836 --> 02:28:01.072
PLUS MUTATIONS ON THIS VARIANT

02:28:01.138 --> 02:28:02.773
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DOWN THE

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:04.141
ROAD AND EVEN FOR FUTURE

02:28:04.208 --> 02:28:05.643
VARIANTS AND AS I MENTIONED IF

02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:07.345
THE WORLD ISN'T VACCINATED. THIS

02:28:07.411 --> 02:28:08.980
WILL CONTINUE TO BE A MAJOR

02:28:09.046 --> 02:28:12.683
THREAT MOVING FORWARD. YOU A

02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:13.985
DOCTOR A REVIEW HIT ON SOMETHING

02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:16.487
A NERVE- WHAT IS. CROSS ON- AND

02:28:16.554 --> 02:28:18.422
THEY SPEND. THAT HAS OBVIOUSLY

02:28:18.489 --> 02:28:23.060
ORIGINATED. IN AFRICA- WOULD YOU

02:28:23.127 --> 02:28:23.894
SAY THAT IF THE FEDERAL

02:28:23.961 --> 02:28:25.329
GOVERNMENT. UNITED STATES

02:28:25.396 --> 02:28:26.097
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

02:28:26.163 --> 02:28:28.332
RESPONSIBILITY. TO PUT RESOURCES

02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:30.468
THERE. SO THAT IT WON'T COME

02:28:30.534 --> 02:28:32.803
HERE. I MEAN I THINK THE MESSAGE

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:34.939
HAS TO BE NOW IN THE STATE BUT

02:28:35.006 --> 02:28:37.308
ALSO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- TRIED

02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:38.976
TO GET AHEAD OF THIS THING SO

02:28:39.043 --> 02:28:42.213
THAT AGAIN WE DON'T SEE. IT

02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:43.948
POPPING UP HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:28:44.015 --> 02:28:45.850
AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

02:28:45.916 --> 02:28:47.818
NOTHING JUST CLOSED THE BORDERS

02:28:47.885 --> 02:28:49.020
IN SAYING TO PEOPLE CAN COME IN

02:28:49.086 --> 02:28:50.321
IS NOT ENOUGH WE HAVE TO PUT

02:28:50.388 --> 02:28:52.623
RESOURCES. INTO THAT JUST AS

02:28:52.690 --> 02:28:54.125
MUCH AS WE NEED TO PUT RESOURCES

02:28:54.191 --> 02:28:55.593
IN ALL COMMUNITIES AND

02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:57.495
EVERYTHING BOILS DOWN TO THE

02:28:57.561 --> 02:28:59.163
RESOURCES COMING INTO OUR

02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:01.165
COMMUNITY SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS

02:29:01.232 --> 02:29:02.466
THE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT

02:29:02.533 --> 02:29:05.069
EXIST IN THIS IN THIS COMMUNITY

02:29:05.136 --> 02:29:06.904
AND TRYING TO A UNDER- NOT ONLY

02:29:06.971 --> 02:29:08.639
UNDERSTAND BUT ALSO ADDRESS

02:29:08.706 --> 02:29:10.841
UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS.

02:29:10.908 --> 02:29:12.376
THAT PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH IN

02:29:12.443 --> 02:29:14.378
OUR COMMUNITY SO WITH THAT-

02:29:14.445 --> 02:29:16.681
THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH- DOES

02:29:16.747 --> 02:29:19.550
ANYONE ELSE. WANT TO CHIME IN ON

02:29:19.617 --> 02:29:21.485
ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID OR YOU

02:29:21.552 --> 02:29:23.220
WANT TO MAKE SOME ADDITIONAL

02:29:23.287 --> 02:29:25.456
COMMENTS OR SOMETHING THAT WE

02:29:25.523 --> 02:29:26.257
HAVE NOT COVERED. AROUND THIS

02:29:26.324 --> 02:29:29.593
TOPIC. I KNOW WE'VE COVERED-

02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:32.363
AWFUL- A LOT OF AND I REALLY

02:29:32.430 --> 02:29:34.031
APPRECIATE CAN ADD NE

02:29:34.098 --> 02:29:35.466
IMPORTANCE OF CONCEPT HERE IS

02:29:35.533 --> 02:29:36.767
THAT I THINK THE CORPORATE TO

02:29:36.834 --> 02:29:38.035
VACATION THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH

02:29:38.102 --> 02:29:40.137
AND TO HELP SPACE HAS SERIOUS

02:29:40.204 --> 02:29:42.173
NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS ON THE

02:29:42.239 --> 02:29:45.242
GROUND SO YOU SAW THAT RETAILERS

02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:46.744
AND MAYBE RETAIL PHARMACIES HAD

02:29:46.811 --> 02:29:48.245
ACCESS TO VACCINES AND THEY WERE

02:29:48.312 --> 02:29:50.481
ABLE TO SECURE THEM AND LOCK

02:29:50.548 --> 02:29:52.650
THEM AWAY RIGHT WITH- OUT REALLY

02:29:52.717 --> 02:29:54.185
DISTRIBUTING THEM AND YET IT WAS

02:29:54.251 --> 02:29:56.153
THE COMMUNITY CLINICS AND- THE

02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:57.321
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT THAT

02:29:57.388 --> 02:29:58.622
REALLY WAS OUT THERE GETTING

02:29:58.689 --> 02:30:00.391
THOSE SHOTS AND ARMS IN SOUTH.

02:30:00.458 --> 02:30:02.026
WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW BIG THESE

02:30:02.093 --> 02:30:03.694
MEDICAL MECCA AS AND OTHER

02:30:03.761 --> 02:30:04.962
PIECES OF THE HEALTHCARE

02:30:05.029 --> 02:30:05.963
LANDSCAPE AND THE

02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:07.698
CANNIBALIZATION THAT'S OCCURRING

02:30:07.765 --> 02:30:09.600
IN THE CORPORATIZATION THEY HAVE

02:30:09.667 --> 02:30:11.635
A REAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS THEY MAY

02:30:11.702 --> 02:30:13.337
NOT HAVE P. P. SHORTAGES BUT

02:30:13.404 --> 02:30:15.172
EVERYONE ELSE DID THEY MAY HAVE

02:30:15.239 --> 02:30:16.407
GOTTEN VACCINES FIRST AND THEN

02:30:16.474 --> 02:30:18.776
THEY LOCKED HIM UP THOSE TYPES

02:30:18.843 --> 02:30:21.345
OF WE'VE CREATED A STE-

02:30:21.412 --> 02:30:23.013
INFRASTRUCTURE WE'VE CREATED A

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:24.815
SCENARIO WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING

02:30:24.882 --> 02:30:26.684
AND IS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN WE'VE

02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:28.252
GOT TO FIND WAYS TO CHECK AND

02:30:28.319 --> 02:30:30.187
BALANCE THAT. AND I THINK THAT

02:30:30.254 --> 02:30:32.189
AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH WHERE WE

02:30:32.256 --> 02:30:33.290
HAD WITH INCREASING ACCESS TO

02:30:33.357 --> 02:30:35.092
CARE WE'RE GONNA TO WATCH REALLY

02:30:35.159 --> 02:30:37.361
CLOSELY THESE VERY LARGE

02:30:37.428 --> 02:30:39.163
ELEPHANTS THAT ARE IN THE ROOM

02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:40.364
THAT WE CANNOT CONTROL TO THE

02:30:40.431 --> 02:30:42.333
STATE LEGISLATURE THAT ARE YOU

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:43.968
KNOW REALLY ABLE TO LOBBY THEIR

02:30:44.034 --> 02:30:45.236
BEST INTERESTS AT THE FEDERAL

02:30:45.302 --> 02:30:47.171
LEVEL BUT THEY HAVE REAL SERIOUS

02:30:47.238 --> 02:30:48.472
IMPLICATIONS FOR WHETHER WE HAVE

02:30:48.539 --> 02:30:50.775
ACCESS TO LIFE SAVING ESSENTIAL

02:30:50.841 --> 02:30:52.510
MEDICINES WHETHER WE HAVE ACCESS

02:30:52.576 --> 02:30:54.378
TO CARE INOUR COMMUNITIES. AND

02:30:54.445 --> 02:30:55.146
SO I REALLY THINK THAT

02:30:55.212 --> 02:30:56.714
CORPORATIZATION NEEDS TO BE

02:30:56.781 --> 02:30:58.582
PRIORITIZED AND SEE HOW DO YOU

02:30:58.649 --> 02:31:00.217
PUT SOME CHECKS AND BALANCES ON

02:31:00.284 --> 02:31:02.453
THAT ROUTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:05.289
MY COLLEAGUE MADE MENTION OF THE

02:31:05.356 --> 02:31:07.425
SITUATION THAT TRANSPIRED IN HIS

02:31:07.491 --> 02:31:10.194
DISTRICT WHERE- IN THE- I THINK

02:31:10.261 --> 02:31:12.563
WAS A YOUNG PERSON HAD TO GO TO-

02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:14.298
A BUSINESS ECSTATIC MITIGATE

02:31:14.365 --> 02:31:19.036
INTERNET- TELEHEALTH IS A MODERN

02:31:19.103 --> 02:31:21.872
DAY- TECHNOLOGY THAT WE USE

02:31:21.939 --> 02:31:23.407
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE

02:31:23.474 --> 02:31:26.076
COULD NOT GO TO THE HOSPITAL-

02:31:26.143 --> 02:31:29.246
AND WE COULD COULD NOT CONSULT A

02:31:29.313 --> 02:31:30.481
DOCTOR SO WE YOU YOU- TELL A- IN

02:31:30.548 --> 02:31:31.916
ORDER TO BE TO COMMUNICATE.

02:31:31.982 --> 02:31:34.218
WHATEVER THE SITUATION MAY BE

02:31:34.285 --> 02:31:36.520
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO REALIZE-

02:31:36.587 --> 02:31:38.189
THAT PEOPLE THAT BROADBAND

02:31:38.255 --> 02:31:40.224
WASN'T REALLY AVAILABLE IN.

02:31:40.291 --> 02:31:41.492
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

02:31:41.559 --> 02:31:43.327
SPECIALLY AND I KEEP ON SAYING

02:31:43.394 --> 02:31:46.297
THIS- PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING.

02:31:46.363 --> 02:31:48.566
ARE YOU CAN EXPECT SOMEONE OR

02:31:48.632 --> 02:31:50.601
YOU CANNOT EXPECT A CHILD TO DO

02:31:50.668 --> 02:31:54.238
DISTANCE LEARNING- AT HOME WITH

02:31:54.305 --> 02:31:56.006
THEIR INTERNET SERVICE IS NOT

02:31:56.073 --> 02:31:57.608
EXISTENCE RIGHT. AND SO THE

02:31:57.675 --> 02:31:59.877
LEGISLATURE PUT OF THE GOVERNOR

02:31:59.944 --> 02:32:01.512
PUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN TO

02:32:01.579 --> 02:32:03.047
TRY TO CONNECT. CREEK

02:32:03.113 --> 02:32:05.549
CONNECTIVITY- FROM THE RULE AND

02:32:05.616 --> 02:32:08.719
URBAN COMMUNITIES- AND SO WE

02:32:08.786 --> 02:32:10.321
HAVE IT IS REYES AS THE ISSUE

02:32:10.387 --> 02:32:12.089
BECAUSE- SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO USE

02:32:12.156 --> 02:32:13.524
THAT METHOD OR TO COMMUNICATE.

02:32:13.591 --> 02:32:14.959
AND IF YOU DON'T IF YOU'RE NOT

02:32:15.025 --> 02:32:17.528
CONNECTED YOU CAN'T COMMUNICATE-

02:32:17.595 --> 02:32:19.163
AND I KNOW OUR SENIORS BECAUSE

02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:23.667
I'VE- HEARD IT MULTIPLE TIMES.

02:32:23.734 --> 02:32:24.201
THAT I DON'T HOW TO USE A

02:32:24.268 --> 02:32:26.804
COMPUTER- BUT WE NEED TO MAKE

02:32:26.871 --> 02:32:27.905
SURE THAT WE DON'T LEAVE THAT

02:32:27.972 --> 02:32:30.174
POPULATION OF OUR COMMUNITY OUT

02:32:30.241 --> 02:32:31.475
THOSE ARE ELDERS THOSE ARE

02:32:31.542 --> 02:32:34.044
SENIORS. AND THAT'S A VERY-

02:32:34.111 --> 02:32:35.880
BARBEL POPULATION EXPANSION WE

02:32:35.946 --> 02:32:38.215
TALK ABOUT THIS PANDEMIC AND SO.

02:32:38.282 --> 02:32:40.284
WE'RE MINDFUL WHEN WE WE'VE DONE

02:32:40.351 --> 02:32:41.318
THE WORK AND WILL CONTINUE TO

02:32:41.385 --> 02:32:43.754
RAISE THIS ISSUE- WILL RETURN

02:32:43.821 --> 02:32:45.222
BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE- IN

02:32:45.289 --> 02:32:47.625
JANUARY I WANT TO GO TO- MISTER

02:32:51.962 --> 02:32:53.864
DOLLARS BROTHER. TEN BILLION

02:32:53.931 --> 02:32:55.766
DOLLARS TELL ME BECAUSE WE TAKE

02:32:55.833 --> 02:32:57.034
IT IS IDEAL TO WRITE THEM DOWN

02:32:57.101 --> 02:32:58.068
AND WE WANT TO TRY SOMETHING WE

02:32:58.135 --> 02:32:59.403
NEVER TRIED BEFORE INFLUENCE OF

02:32:59.470 --> 02:33:00.905

WILL BE A MOUTH PIECE FOR YOU

02:33:02.973 --> 02:33:04.041
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO BUDGET

DOLLARS I THOUGHT ABOUT IT- K.

02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:11.749
SO IF I HAD TWO MILLION DOLLARS

02:33:11.815 --> 02:33:13.717
