THE BILL IS THAT IT ESTABLISHES

00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:03.314
ECONOMIC ADVISORY GROUP OF

00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:04.549
INDUSTRY WASTE HAULERS LOCAL

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:06.584
GOVERNMENTS AND OTHERS. IT DOES

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:08.720
NOT TRY TO WRITE ALL THE RAGS

00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:10.121
WE DIDN'T TRY TO CROSS EVERY

00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:11.923
TEEN DOT EVERY ICE SO THAT WE

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.359

STAKEHOLDER TO FIGURE IT OUT

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:19.564
THE END I THINK GIVEN WHO THE

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:22.033
AUTHORS ARE. IN JUST THE NATURE

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.401
OF OUR PROCESS THAT IF WE

HOPE OF MOVING THIS FORWARD

WHEN WE'VE HAD SUCH AND- SUCH A

00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:47.051

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:50.121
GOTTEN. SO MUCH OPPOSITION OFF

THE BOTTOM LINE KEEPS GETTING

00:30:13.178 --> 00:30:13.878
MORE PROBLEMATIC BOTH FOR

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:16.314

RIGHT AT. I WOULD SAY THIS SOME

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.512
OF THE THOUGHTS THAT WERE

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.047
BROUGHT UP I DON'T DISAGREE

00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:51.282
RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT SENATOR

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:52.483
SKINNER HAS TALKED ABOUT WHAT

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:53.384
WE HAVE NEEDED ABOUT

00:30:53.451 --> 00:30:54.686
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HAS SOME

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:55.787
COMMITMENTS IN THE FUTURE

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:57.088
THAT'S A THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM

00:30:57.155 --> 00:30:58.356
WE'VE GOT A CHICKEN AND EGG

00:30:58.423 --> 00:30:59.958
THING GOING ON HERE. AND WE

00:31:00.024 --> 00:31:02.493
KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO CREATE

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.928
THE TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT WHERE

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:05.530
WE NEED TO INVEST IN THAT

00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:06.698
INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TO

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:08.032
CREATE THE GOALS I MEAN IT AND

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:09.434
WE'VE SEEN THAT THAT'S WHY WERE

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.936
IN THIS SITUATION SO I DON'T

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.738
WANT TO. I DON'T WANT TO

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:15.673
SUGGEST THAT THAT WERE READY WE

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.009
WILL BE READY THOUGH YES THE

00:31:18.076 --> 00:31:18.843
SECOND THING I WANT TO POINT

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.212
OUT IS. IT TO THE STEEL WORKERS

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:23.648
IF I THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE THAT

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:26.084
THIS WAS GOING TO JEOPARDIZE

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:27.552
GOOD UNION JOBS I WOULDN'T BE

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:30.221
HERE I ACTUALLY THINK THAT

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:32.824
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BILL IS A

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.359
REINVESTMENT OF GOOD UNION JOBS

00:31:34.425 --> 00:31:36.628
IN CALIFORNIA. A STATE WHERE WE

00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:38.363
NEED THEM AND IT'S NOT ONLY

00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:39.764
GLASS BECAUSE THE INCENTIVES TO

00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:41.532
MANUFACTURE HERE BUT ALSO IN

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:42.967
RECYCLING IN THE ENTIRE

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:44.669
CIRCULAR ECONOMY PROVIDES US

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.371
OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY CREATE

00:31:46.437 --> 00:31:47.905
JOBS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WE

00:31:47.972 --> 00:31:49.874
KNOW ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE

00:31:49.941 --> 00:31:51.809
UNION JOBS. AND IN FACT I THINK

00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:53.244
WILL ADD TO THAT THEIR GOOD

00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:55.046
PAYING UNION JOBS THAT'S PART

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:56.714
OF WHY I AM COMMITTED TO THIS

00:31:56.781 --> 00:31:59.617
BILL SO I UNDERSTAND THE FEAR

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:01.386
OF CHANGE AND THE FEAR OF LIKE

00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:02.820
WHAT. COULD HAPPEN OUT OF THIS

00:32:02.887 --> 00:32:09.861
BUT I DO WANT TO SAY. I WANT TO

00:32:09.927 --> 00:32:14.165
ENSURE THE WORKERS THAT. I

00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:15.733
DON'T SEE ANY ASPECT OF THIS

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.634
THAT WILL COST GOOD UNION JOBS.

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:17.535
AND THE GLASS IF IT'S KIND OF

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:18.202
HARD TO SIT HERE WHEN THEY TALK

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:19.103
ABOUT HOW THEY'RE COMPLETELY

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:19.704
RECYCLABLE AND THAT THEY CAN'T

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:20.571
SOMEHOW FIT INTO THIS.

00:32:20.638 --> 00:32:23.274
RECYCLABLE GOALS YOU KNOW SO I

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:25.943
THINK I UNDERSTAND. THE CONCERN

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.645
WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND

00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:28.546
WE'RE VERY CLEAR BY THE

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:29.514
ADMINISTRATION THAT THIS HAS TO

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.749
BE. MATERIAL NEUTRAL AND I

00:32:31.816 --> 00:32:33.084
THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING I

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:34.352
ALSO DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:35.820
BE. TOO MUCH OF A STRETCH FOR

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:38.289
GLASS TO. TAKES HIT THE GOALS

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:42.093
ESPECIALLY WITH THE DELAY TO

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:42.660
TWENTY TWENTY SIX FROM THE-

00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:46.898
BARBELL. SO WITH THAT I AGES

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.666
WHEN ADDRESS SMALL CONCERNS AND

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:49.667
I RESPECT FELT WHY NOT SO OUR

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:51.069
MANAGER ACTUALLY. ON OUR VICE

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:52.003

ABSOLUTELY NO. EXTREMELY

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:10.855
IMPORTANT TO WHAT WE SEE GOING

00:33:10.922 --> 00:33:13.291
ON IN THE OP. THE RECYCLING

00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:14.792
WORLD BUT WHAT TROUBLES ME AS

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:18.596
WE CERTAINLY DELEGATE TOO MUCH

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:21.833
RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT ENOUGH.

00:33:21.899 --> 00:33:22.600
BUT FAVOR A ROLE FOR

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:02.707
FALLS ON THE CONSUMERS AND ALL

I THINK OVER THE COUPLE YEARS

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:25.596

ON THE TABLE BECAUSE I THINK WE

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:32.437
NEED TO BE BACK HERE TO TALK

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:35.139
ABOUT SOME OF THE- LET'S SAY

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:36.407
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:38.309
ARE COMING. GOING TO COME OUT

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:43.981
OF IMPLEMENTATION. OF SOMETHING

00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:44.515
THAT'S VERY COMPLEX AT THE

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:50.855
MOMENT. THANK YOU I THANK YOU

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:51.522
VERY MUCH I MISTER CHAIR

MEMBERS I'M SCOTT SMITH LINE

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.524
DIRECTOR OF COVER CYCLE MAYBE

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:54.459
IF I COULD JUST START BY SAYING

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:55.293
APPRECIATE MANY COMMENTS THAT

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:56.494
WERE MADE HERE TODAY CERTAINLY

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:57.762
THE APPROACH AS WE PERCEIVE IT

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:59.263
THAT HAS BEEN WORKED WORKED OUT

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.331
THROUGH THE LAST MONTH OF THIS

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:01.899
BILL IS ONE THAT MAXIMIZES

00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:03.134
FLEXIBILITYOF COPLIANCE AND

00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:04.135
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:06.037
IMPORTANT TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:35:06.103 --> 00:35:06.904
THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF

00:35:06.971 --> 00:35:08.272
CONVERSATIONS SOME OF THEM

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:09.540
LATER IN THE PROCESS BUT

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:11.476
SUBSTANTIVE NONE THE LESS THAT

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:12.477
ADDRESS. PRODUCT SAFETY FOOD

00:35:12.543 --> 00:35:14.946
SAFETY THE MINIMUS AMOUNTS OF

00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:16.347
DIFFICULT TO HANDLE MATERIALS

00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:17.315
MATERIALS WITH UNIQUE

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:19.750
CHALLENGES SMALL BUSINESS

00:35:19.817 --> 00:35:21.853
EXCEPTIONS OFFRAMP THE ABILITY

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:23.588
FOR US TO FORM A WORKGROUP THE

00:35:23.654 --> 00:35:24.689
CIRCULAR ECONOMY GROUP THAT

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:26.724
WILL MEET REGULARLY AND REPORT

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:27.525
BACK AND MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:29.293
WHETHER WE SHOULD BE ADJUSTING

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.595
AND THESE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE

00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:32.263
IN THE BILL SO WE STRONG

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.231
SUPPORT THAT APPROACH I JUST

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:35.299
WANTED TO MENTION THAT

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:37.068
SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:39.403
THE FEE THE FEE HAS A VERY

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.438
SPECIFIC PERFECT PURPOSE AS

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:41.973
OUTLINED HERE THE FEE IS TO

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:43.774
COVER THE REASONABLE COST OF

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:45.543
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.144
SO THERE'S NO ABILITY FOR THE

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:50.181
DEPARTMENT. TO RAISE A FEE TO

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:51.782
SAVE STARTING TO INCENTIVE

00:35:51.849 --> 00:35:53.451
PROGRAM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:55.119
WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:58.789
THAT AND WE ARE GOVERNED BY THE

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:01.158
REGULATORY PROP OBVIOUSLY AND

00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:01.692
ONE OF THE COMPOUND TôI

00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:02.560
PROCESS SOMEONE NAZARIAN WARNED

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:04.662
US THAT THE BURDEN IS UPON THE

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:05.796
DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP

00:36:05.863 --> 00:36:07.498
REGULATIONS THAT ARE THE LEAST

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:08.966
BURDENSOME AS POSSIBLE AND

00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:14.338
THAT'S THE STANDARD THAT. WERE

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:14.805
HELD TO WHEN WE SUBMIT

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:19.544
REGULATION THE WAY. SO THAT.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:20.511
APPLIED WAS WITH RESPECT THAT

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:21.279
FEE AS WELL SO THERE IS NO CARD

00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:21.879
LAUNCH THERE IS NO WE CAN SET

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:22.813
THE FEW WHEREVER WE WANT WE

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.648
HAVE. DEVELOPED REGULATIONS

00:36:23.714 --> 00:36:24.482
THAT WILL. ACHIEVE THE

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:25.449
REQUIREMENTS IN THE STATUTE THE

00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:26.150
GOAL THAT NEED TO BE MET. WE

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:27.184
HAVE A PROCESS LAID OUT FOR OUR

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:27.685
TO DO THAT INCLUDING AN

00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:28.185
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. AND

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:29.220
WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS.

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:31.022
BUT ULTIMATELY THAT PEOPLE JUST

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:31.556
TO BE COVERED THE REVIEWS

00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:34.759
REASONABLE. COST OF

00:36:34.825 --> 00:36:35.326
IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM. I

00:36:35.393 --> 00:36:38.763
KNOW I HOPE THAT. AB THOUGH

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:39.530
THAT'S THAT'S THE LANGUAGE FROM

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:40.665
PROP TWENTY SIX I MEAN THAT IS

00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:41.632
THE ROUTE THE REQUIREMENT ON IS

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:43.601
JUST LITERALLY JUST. THE

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:44.135
MINIMUM COST IMPLEMENT THE

00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:47.305
PROGRAM. AND WE MUST DO SO IN

00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:49.373
IN THE MATTER THAT'S THE LEAST

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:49.941
BURDENSOME AND THAT INCLUDES

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:52.410
ATTEMPTING TO MINIMIZE THAT FEE.

00:36:52.476 --> 00:36:53.678
YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:55.479
WILL BE THE YOU TALK ABOUT

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.748
STAKEHOLDERS WHO THAT THE TABLE.

00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:58.583
BECAUSE THE COSTS ARE

00:36:58.649 --> 00:37:00.418
DETERMINED BY THE PRODUCERS SO

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:02.119
OFTEN THOSE AREN'T.

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:04.388
LEGITIMATELY A ANALYZE WHEN WE

00:37:04.455 --> 00:37:07.825
LOOK AT WHAT IT COSTS TO

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:08.459
ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM FROM THE

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:09.694
OTHER SIDE FROM THE BUREAUCRACY.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.363
SO THE BILL HAS TWO PRIMARY

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.564
STAGES IF YOU WILL THERE IS AN

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:15.399
EARLY STAGE WHERE THE

00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:16.334
DEPARTMENT WILL MEET REALLY

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.335
NEED TO GET SOME THINGS IN

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.569
PLACE SO WE WILL NEED TO

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:19.370
DEVELOP SOME REPORTING

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:21.005
REQUIREMENTS DEVELOP PACKAGING

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.473
CATEGORIES DETECTOR THAT NEED

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.908
TO BE DONE SO WE CAN GET. THE

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:27.712
SORT OF THE LONGEST ON RAMP IF

00:37:27.778 --> 00:37:31.349

00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:31.983
RESPONSIBILITY INTO THE PROGRAM

WAYS POLLUTION REDUCTION PANEL

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:44.895
ON THAT PANEL IS GOING TO BE SO

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:48.099

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:56.641
BALANCED WAY SO THAT WE MAKE

REQUIRED IN THE BILL I HAVE TO

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.554
SPEAK TO THE CHAIRMAN ON THIS

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:11.789

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:19.096
FORMED FORMATTED AND FORMULATED

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:20.765
WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE

00:38:20.831 --> 00:38:21.699
THE ISSUES BROUGHT UP HERE

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:24.001

THIS ROOM IS REALLY ON THE SAME

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.072

ADDRESS THOSE. BUT I THINK IT'S

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.229
CRITICAL CERTAINLY FOR THE

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:52.797
PRODUCERS AND THE CONSUMERS.

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:53.431

IN THE LAST TEN YEARS SO WE

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:06.110

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:07.078
TO BE DONE AND I THINK WE NEED

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:08.779
TO HAVE A BETTER.

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:10.614
