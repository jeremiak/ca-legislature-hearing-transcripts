.

00:57:14.698 --> 00:57:17.634 region:rollup2
DESPITE OUR STATUS AS THE SIX

WHICH ARE CRITICAL.

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:25.542 region:rollup2
.

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:26.076 region:rollup2
OUR PROSPERITY IS LOCALIZED

00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:26.610 region:rollup2
AROUND THE STATE'S WRITTEN

00:57:26.076 --> 00:57:29.546 region:rollup2
REGION STATE ABOUND OTHER

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:31.148 region:rollup2
PLACES.

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:32.349 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC GROWTH IS POOR MEAGER

00:57:31.148 --> 00:57:34.117 region:rollup2
THIS AFFECTS ECONOMIC

00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:35.819 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY THE SENSE OF HOPE

00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:37.821 region:rollup2
ACROSS RURAL STATE.

00:57:35.819 --> 00:57:39.089 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE INEQUITIES.

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:43.093 region:rollup2
ARE BOUND UP IN THIS QUESTION

00:57:39.089 --> 00:57:44.795 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE GROW OUR ECONOMY.

00:57:43.093 --> 00:57:47.264 region:rollup2
THEREFORE THIS BILL IS REALLY A

00:57:44.795 --> 00:57:48.332 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP BILL.

00:57:47.264 --> 00:57:50.100 region:rollup2
AND BEFORE I TURN TO MY

00:57:48.332 --> 00:57:51.968 region:rollup2
WITNESSES.

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.869 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO OFFER A FEW COMMENTS

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:53.937 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW I THINK ABOUT

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:56.473 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP AND WHY THIS BILL

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:57.674 region:rollup2
FITS INTO THAT.

00:57:56.473 --> 00:57:59.676 region:rollup2
IN ITS MOST BASIC FORM

00:57:57.674 --> 00:58:00.610 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP IS.

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:01.611 region:rollup2
CAN BE SUMMARIZED IN THE PHRASE

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:03.547 region:rollup2
YOU CANNOT BLOW AN UNCERTAIN

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:04.848 region:rollup2
TRUMPET.

00:58:03.547 --> 00:58:06.149 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:07.617 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO BE CLEAR AND

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:09.720 region:rollup2
COMPELLING. AND ON THAT MESSAGE

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:10.921 region:rollup2
ALL THE TIME.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.689 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THAT IS IMPORTANT TO

00:58:10.921 --> 00:58:15.058 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP.

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:16.927 region:rollup2
BLOWING A CLEAR COMPELLING

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:19.229 region:rollup2
TRUMPET.

00:58:16.927 --> 00:58:20.964 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

00:58:19.229 --> 00:58:22.232 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO NEED TO GET DOWN AND

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:23.567 region:rollup2
SAY WELL WORDS LEADERSHIP NEED

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:25.268 region:rollup2
HAPPENED ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

00:58:23.567 --> 00:58:27.104 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU DIVERT THOSE WE TO

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:29.139 region:rollup2
START TO HAVE AN IMPACT.

00:58:27.104 --> 00:58:30.440 region:rollup2
A AND THAT ACTUALLY IS WORK.

00:58:29.139 --> 00:58:31.775 region:rollup2
IT'S INTELLECTUALLY BRITS ARE

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.677 region:rollup2
WORKERS LAWMAKERS.

00:58:31.775 --> 00:58:35.512 region:rollup2
A.

00:58:33.677 --> 00:58:37.180 region:rollup2
A FAVORITE COMMENT ON THIS ON

00:58:35.512 --> 00:58:39.015 region:rollup2
THIS CHALLENGES ONE OF FDR.

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.183 region:rollup2
WHO?

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:41.485 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY APPOINTED MY

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:43.420 region:rollup2
GRANDFATHER POSTMASTER OF

00:58:41.485 --> 00:58:45.722 region:rollup2
HEALDSBURG CALIFORNIA.

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:47.357 region:rollup2
FDR LIKE TO SAILORS REMEMBERED

00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:50.060 region:rollup2
FOR SAYING THE TEST OF A FIRST

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:51.294 region:rollup2
RATE INTELLIGENCE.

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.796 region:rollup2
IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:56.166 region:rollup2
TO HOLD TWO OPPOSED IDEAS IN THE

00:58:52.796 --> 00:58:57.634 region:rollup2
MIND OF THE SAME TIME.

00:58:56.166 --> 00:59:00.370 region:rollup2
ONE SHOULD FOR EXAMPLE BE ABLE

00:58:57.634 --> 00:59:01.538 region:rollup2
TO SEE THAT THINGS ARE HOPELESS.

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:04.141 region:rollup2
AND YET BE DETERMINED MAKE THEM

00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:05.142 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE.

00:59:04.141 --> 00:59:06.343 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WHEN YOU START

00:59:05.142 --> 00:59:07.844 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO IT ISSUE LIKE HOW DO

00:59:06.343 --> 00:59:09.513 region:rollup2
WE REALLY IS. PUBLIC POLICY

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:11.014 region:rollup2
MAKERS.

00:59:09.513 --> 00:59:12.249 region:rollup2
LABOR TO GET A MORE SYSTEMATIC

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:14.317 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO GROWING BUSINESS IN

00:59:12.249 --> 00:59:15.685 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. GIVEN THE SCALE THE

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:17.788 region:rollup2
MAGNITUDE OF CALIFORNIA AT US

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:19.089 region:rollup2
BOTH A DAUNTING. ALMOST HOPELESS

00:59:17.788 --> 00:59:21.825 region:rollup2
PROSPECT.

00:59:19.089 --> 00:59:22.392 region:rollup2
BUT ONE BEGUN WORK ON.

00:59:21.825 --> 00:59:23.827 region:rollup2
AND.

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:24.995 region:rollup2
SO THEN IT BECOMES OF HIM

00:59:23.827 --> 00:59:27.798 region:rollup2
SOLUTION PROBLEM HOW DO YOU WORK

00:59:24.995 --> 00:59:28.932 region:rollup2
ON IT.

00:59:27.798 --> 00:59:31.134 region:rollup2
I HAVE A QUOTE FOR THAT TOO

00:59:28.932 --> 00:59:32.402 region:rollup2
THAT'S THOMAS EDISON.

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:34.037 region:rollup2
THOMAS EDISON THE GREAT INVENTOR

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:35.906 region:rollup2
WHO SAID.

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:38.842 region:rollup2
THERE CAMINO. THERE COULD BE NO

00:59:35.906 --> 00:59:39.810 region:rollup2
PROGRESS.

00:59:38.842 --> 00:59:41.211 region:rollup2
UNTIL A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:42.979 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT.

00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:45.449 region:rollup2
BECOME DISSATISFIED.

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:47.150 region:rollup2
THE WAY THINGS ARE.

00:59:45.449 --> 00:59:48.084 region:rollup2
AND THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN WHEN

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:50.086 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BROUGHT THINK BEYOND THE

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:51.988 region:rollup2
LIMITS TO WHICH THEIR CUSTOM.

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:53.523 region:rollup2
SO I THINK A CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:55.125 region:rollup2
OUR GREAT ECONOMY HOW BOOM IT IS

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:57.294 region:rollup2
DOZEN TAIL LOOKING AT WHAT ARE

00:59:55.125 --> 00:59:58.361 region:rollup2
THE WEAKNESSES.

00:59:57.294 --> 00:59:59.463 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO BE

00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:01.698 region:rollup2
DISSATISFIED ABOUT.

00:59:59.463 --> 01:00:02.599 region:rollup2
AND REALLY.

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:05.669 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE PROSPECTS FOR

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:06.303 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT THAT WE CAN TARGET.

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:08.305 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL IS GOING

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:09.473 region:rollup2
AFTER.

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:11.341 region:rollup2
AND THIS THEN CONCLUDES BEFORE

01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:13.110 region:rollup2
WITH MY OWN QUOTED MYSELF THERE

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:14.978 region:rollup2
IS A LEADERSHIP SYLLOGISM FOR

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:16.246 region:rollup2
HOW YOU MOVE PEOPLE FORWARD.

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:17.380 region:rollup2
AND BASS INVOLVES SAYING HERE'S

01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:19.516 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE TODAY WHICH IS BAD

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:21.151 region:rollup2
FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.

01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:22.018 region:rollup2
HERE'S VERY BE TOMORROW WHICH IF

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:23.553 region:rollup2
WE DID THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR

THE FOLLOWING REASONS.

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:28.225 region:rollup2
HERE'S HOW YOU GO FROM A TO BE.

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:29.893 region:rollup2

FROM OHIO IN MICHIGAN.

AND WHEN I FIRST CAME IN THE

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:35.825 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA I WAS AND BUILT A

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:38.028 region:rollup2
SORT OF IT ORGANIZATION FROM

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:39.996 region:rollup2
SCRATCH I WAS LOOKING FOR THE

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:40.997 region:rollup2
PLAN I WOULD PLUG INTO. IT

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:43.333 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE STATE SETS THE

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:43.800 region:rollup2
STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE

01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:45.869 region:rollup2
DIRECTION FOR ALL THE

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.737 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:49.306 region:rollup2
DID WAS STEM CELL RESEARCH OPENS

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:50.774 region:rollup2
UP THAT MARKET FOR A SACRAMENTO

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:52.809 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. WHAT YOU DO ON

01:01:50.774 --> 01:01:54.344 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE IN DEMAND

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:55.412 region:rollup2
POLICIES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES

01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:57.280 region:rollup2
WELL THAT ALLOWS US TO BUILD

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:59.382 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CORRIDOR IN A

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.550 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY LIKE SACRAMENTO? AND.

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:02.852 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW WHAT I

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:04.955 region:rollup2
SAW WAS IN A VERY LARGE COMPLEX

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:06.222 region:rollup2
STATE DOING A LOT OF FASCINATING

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:07.824 region:rollup2
THINGS AND.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:09.292 region:rollup2
YOU ONE OF THE REASONS THAT.

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:11.494 region:rollup2
THE BAY AREA COUNCIL THAT IS

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:12.529 region:rollup2
HERE IS I WENT DOWN AND SAW JIM

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:14.531 region:rollup2
WONDERMENT AND ASKED HIM ABOUT

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:15.498 region:rollup2
TO PLUG INTO A PLAN WITH. THE

01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:17.300 region:rollup2
BAY AREA COUNCIL THEY WERE MORE

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:18.902 region:rollup2
PROMINENT HAD MORE INFLUENCE WE

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.704 region:rollup2
DID AND SO WE BUILT A MEGA

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:22.906 region:rollup2
REGION STRATEGY BETWEEN THE BAY

01:02:20.704 --> 01:02:25.342 region:rollup2
AREA COUNCIL ON US. AND WE HAVE

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:26.610 region:rollup2
THE SAME STRATEGY AROUND CHINA

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:28.645 region:rollup2
BUSINESS RETENTION IN NORTHERN

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:31.314 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA NOW STARTING TO SHARE

01:02:28.645 --> 01:02:31.781 region:rollup2
SOME STRATEGIES AROUND THINGS

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.149 region:rollup2
LIKE TRANSPORTATION.

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:34.217 region:rollup2
THAT HELPS A BAY AREA COUNCIL

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:36.253 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY GET ANOTHER PARTNER

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:37.220 region:rollup2
HIS CLOSE THE STATE CAPITAL THAT

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.622 region:rollup2
HELPS US BECAUSE WE GET AN

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:40.624 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION WITH REAL LIFTING

01:02:38.622 --> 01:02:42.025 region:rollup2
POWER AND. WHEN YOU'RE DO YOU'RE

01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:44.260 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ESTABLISH YOURSELF

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:45.962 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OF MY GREAT FRUSTRATIONS

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:47.597 region:rollup2
EVEN WHEN I WAS IN A CALIFORNIAN

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:49.599 region:rollup2
WAS WATCHING RICK PERRY COME TO

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:51.601 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. AND TALK ABOUT OUR

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:53.269 region:rollup2
STATE AND NOT SEE A MEASURED

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:55.472 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO HIS COMMENTS.

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:57.307 region:rollup2
AND IT REALLY FRUSTRATED ME A TO

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:59.409 region:rollup2
SEE THAT AND SO ONE OF THE FIRST

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:59.909 region:rollup2
THINGS WE DID AS AN ORGANIZATION

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:01.911 region:rollup2
RICK SCOTT CAME INTO LOS

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:03.913 region:rollup2
ANGELES.

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:06.116 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA TO TAKE

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:07.417 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES OUT OF

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:09.586 region:rollup2
SOUTH CAROLINA. ARE AT A

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:11.054 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO FLORIDA.

01:03:09.586 --> 01:03:12.222 region:rollup2
AND HE WAS TOUTING THE FLORIDA

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:13.323 region:rollup2
PORTS

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:14.457 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE THE CALIFORNIA

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:15.625 region:rollup2
PRESS WAS DOING THEIR JOB

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:17.227 region:rollup2
READING EVERYTHING HE SAID IT

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:18.161 region:rollup2
LIKE IT WAS THE GOSPEL. AND

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:19.929 region:rollup2
PUTTING THEM ON THE FRONT PAGE

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:21.398 region:rollup2
OF ALL OF OUR NEWSPAPERS AND WE

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:23.033 region:rollup2
DID THE ANALYSIS AND FOUND OUT

01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:24.801 region:rollup2
THE LONG BEACH PORT.

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:26.736 region:rollup2
BY ITSELF WAS MORE POWERFUL

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:28.938 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY THAN ALL THE FLOOR

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:30.407 region:rollup2
REPORTS COMBINED. SO WE PUT A

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:31.708 region:rollup2
LITTLE PRESS RELEASE OUT ON THAT

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:34.377 region:rollup2
GOT PICKED UP IN ALL THE FLORIDA

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:35.545 region:rollup2
NEWSPAPERS THAT RICK SCOTT SORT

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:37.480 region:rollup2
O MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF IN

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:38.782 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WITHIN COMPARED OUR

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.316 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS WITH

01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:41.618 region:rollup2
FLORIDA. WE CAME BACK TO GET

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:43.486 region:rollup2
CRITICIZED FOR NOT FOCUSING ON

01:03:41.618 --> 01:03:44.854 region:rollup2
EDUCATION

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:46.923 region:rollup2
NINE I'M SEE RICK SCOTT AGAIN.

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:48.992 region:rollup2
INTERSTATE BUT THROUGHOUT

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:50.360 region:rollup2
THERE'S OVER A TWELVE STATES

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:51.561 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE STRATEGIC PLANS TO

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:54.397 region:rollup2
COME THE CALIFORNIA TAKE JOBS

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:55.832 region:rollup2
FROM US AND IT'S LISTED BY NAME.

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:57.667 region:rollup2
SO I HAVE BOTH AND I WON'T BORE

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:59.869 region:rollup2
YOU TO DEATH BUT. THIS IS WHAT

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.770 region:rollup2
WE GOT WE GO OUT NATIONALLY TO

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:02.339 region:rollup2
TWELVE U. S. MARKETS

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:03.740 region:rollup2
WE SEND OUT TWO THOUSAND

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.841 region:rollup2
NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS EVERY

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.309 region:rollup2
QUARTER TO THESE NATIONAL

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:07.877 region:rollup2
NETWORKS.

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:09.279 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:10.947 region:rollup2
SAY THERE SHOULD BE NINE PEOPLE

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:13.183 region:rollup2
LEFT IN CALIFORNIA.

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:14.651 region:rollup2
SO WE WERE NOT JUST THE LARGEST

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:16.186 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:18.421 region:rollup2
WHERE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:19.356 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:21.124 region:rollup2
AND PRODUCTIVITY AND

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:23.960 region:rollup2
PROFITABILITY FOR INDUSTRIES IN

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:25.628 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DWARFS TEXAS SO

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.497 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST A PRODUCTIVITY CHART

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:29.833 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A.

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:31.434 region:rollup2
PROFITABILITY CHART THAT SHOWS

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:32.535 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE THOUSANDS OF PERCENT

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:33.803 region:rollup2
MORE PROFITABLE FOR INDUSTRIES

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:35.839 region:rollup2
IN TEXAS

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:37.807 region:rollup2
SO YOU GET A ZERO CORPORATE TAX

01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:39.342 region:rollup2
RATE AND TAXES. ARE IN BUSINESS

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:41.277 region:rollup2
TO MAKE MONEY OR IN BUSINESS TO

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:42.379 region:rollup2
AVOID TAXES SAID CALIFORNIA

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:44.447 region:rollup2
OFFERS A MUCH GREATER

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:46.316 region:rollup2
PROFITABILITY POTENTIAL. FOR

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:48.318 region:rollup2
FIFTY INDUSTRIES WE ANALYZED

01:04:46.316 --> 01:04:50.053 region:rollup2
FIFTY INDUSTRIES THAT ARE ALL

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:52.322 region:rollup2
MORE PROFITABLE IN CALIFORNIA

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:53.790 region:rollup2
THEN AND TAXES.

01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:55.358 region:rollup2
YET. I WILL I DON'T HAVE A REAL

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:57.794 region:rollup2
HAVE LIKE A SLIDE SHOW BUT A

01:04:55.358 --> 01:05:00.029 region:rollup2
BRING UP THE NEXT SLIDE.

01:04:57.794 --> 01:05:00.563 region:rollup2
THAT FRUSTRATES ME.

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:02.232 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS WHAT THEY THINK

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:04.234 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:07.237 region:rollup2
SO WE GO OUT NATIONALLY WE CAN

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:08.238 region:rollup2
BARELY GET A COMMUNICATION OUT.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:09.706 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS ALL THERE

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:11.174 region:rollup2
HEARING RIGHT.

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:12.876 region:rollup2
NOW THE BEAUTY OF THIS SITE

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:15.011 region:rollup2
SELECTION MAGAZINE WERE

01:05:12.876 --> 01:05:16.980 region:rollup2
DEMANDING A RETRACTION BECAUSE

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:18.748 region:rollup2
WE CUT THEM IN MATH THERE.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.517 region:rollup2
SO SITE SELECTION MAGAZINE DID

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:22.886 region:rollup2
THE RANKING AND WE CUT THEM IN

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:25.188 region:rollup2
MATH FAIRS ON THE TAX POLICY.

01:05:22.886 --> 01:05:27.557 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE BEEN RATED FIFTIETH AND

01:05:25.188 --> 01:05:28.792 region:rollup2
TAXES BY SITE SELECTION MAGAZINE

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:30.560 region:rollup2
FOR YEARS AND THEY'VE BEEN USING

01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:31.728 region:rollup2
THE WRONG DATA THEY ARE ALSO

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.496 region:rollup2
USING THE WRONG DATA ON POWER

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:35.131 region:rollup2
COSTS.

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:36.933 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE SITTING AROUND THINKING

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:38.268 region:rollup2
WOW YOU NO AS A STATE WE'RE

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:40.270 region:rollup2
LETTING YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR OF

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.771 region:rollup2
ARIZONA THE GOVERNOR OF UTAH THE

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:43.339 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR OF IOWA THE GOVERNOR

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:44.374 region:rollup2
TAXES. TRAVEL ALL OVER THE

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:46.643 region:rollup2
COUNTRY AND SAY THESE THINGS

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:48.411 region:rollup2
ABOUT OUR STATE. AND MANY TIMES

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:50.680 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS NOT TRUE.

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:52.115 region:rollup2
AND YET WEARS A RESPONSE FOR US

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:54.150 region:rollup2
IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT'S

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:55.852 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING CALIFORNIA'S BRAND

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:57.253 region:rollup2
SO STATEWIDE STRATEGY STARTS

01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:59.122 region:rollup2
WITH ALL OF US UNDERSTANDING

01:05:57.253 --> 01:06:00.623 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S STRENGTHS AND HOW

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:02.058 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT OUR STATE. THAT WE

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:04.294 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT OUR STATE THAT REALLY

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:04.494 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATES US AND TELLS HER

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:05.829 region:rollup2
STORY.

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:07.197 region:rollup2
.

01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:08.832 region:rollup2
WE'RE PUTTING A CALIFORNIA

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:10.233 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE INDEX TOGETHER

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:11.734 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ADDING THINGS LIKE

THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:23.385 region:rollup2
SEEN IS MANY.

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:25.187 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS NEED CERTAIN TYPES

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:26.355 region:rollup2

IN MANY OF OUR REGIONS ACCESS

WHOLE NOTHER PIECE OF

01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:03.192 region:rollup2

WE'VE HAD WITH THAT LEGISLATION.

01:21:05.828 --> 01:21:09.832 region:rollup2

AND.

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:33.455 region:rollup2
THIS THIS IS ALL OVER THE BOARD

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:35.023 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE APPLYING FOR

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:37.559 region:rollup2

01:21:40.362 --> 01:21:45.200 region:rollup2
THE NEWCOMERS AND AND SMALL

01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:46.268 region:rollup2

HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO COMPETE

01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:52.941 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T BECAUSE

01:21:49.972 --> 01:21:55.511 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE UP THE THE TEAM

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:56.145 region:rollup2
PUT TOGETHER THAT THAT HAS THE

OF LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD IN

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.256 region:rollup2

THIS REALLY BROUGHT FOR FORWARD.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:29.831 region:rollup2
HOW'RE WE COORDINATING WHO IS

01:24:27.596 --> 01:24:32.034 region:rollup2
