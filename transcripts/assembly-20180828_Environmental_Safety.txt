AND I WANNA THANK YOU ALL FOR ALL THE CLOSE ALL OF THE HARD WORK YOU'VE DONE. AND FOR ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE ROOM. ARE BEING PART OF THIS PROCESS YUVAL. ARE GOT NEXT THE POINT WHERE WE ARE NOW. I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT WE GET THIS TO THE FLOOR AND THE REASON IS WHETHER YOU'RE FOR A TAKE BACK PROGRAM OR NOT. WE CAN ALL AGREE HAVING. FORTY DIFFERENT TAKE BACK PROGRAMS HE'S NOT A GOOD IDEA I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE TERRIBLY INEFFECTIVE AND THEN THE VARIOUS -- COUNTIES PARTICULARLY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WHICH WAS THE FIRST ONE TO GO -- I CAN'T TELL WELL. I'VE LOOKED UP WHERE THEIR SITES ARE IN THEIR NOT AVAIL NOT REALLY EASILY AVAILABLE TO ANYONE. SO HELP ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN GET HERE IS -- JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WORKS BETTER WHERE PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THE PICKUP SITES ARE HAVING A STATEWIDE PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE A BIG HELP IN THAT [inaudible] AND SENATOR PLEASE PRESENT. WELL THANK YOU KIND OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JUSTICE ARE OF A BILL I BEEN WORKING ON FOR QUITE SOMETIME AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. WHEN WE STARTED WE TRY TO GET ALL THE STAKE HOLDERS IN THE ROOM TOGETHER THAT ALONE WAS A CHALLENGE -- BY THE END OF THE FIRST OUR I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO CALL. A NINE ONE ONE BECAUSE WE COULD NOT GET AGREEMENT ON ANYTHING. AND SINCE SEPARATE OF TIME AS YOU ARE INDICATED THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE CREATED THEIR OWN PROGRAMS. SO WE NOW HAVE A VERITABLE HODGE PODGE [inaudible] PROGRAMS -- I BELIEVE THAT I THINK -- EVERYONE WHO STEPPED UP BELIEVE WE COULD GET TO YES ON THIS AND SO. THIS IS YES IT'S NOT A PERFECT YES BUT IT I BELIEVE WILL -- MOVE US FORWARD TO CREATE PROGRAMS THAT AS YOU INDICATE ARE EFFECTIVE WHERE PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THEY CAN GO WHERE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE. AND SO I'M VERY DELIGHTED -- A LITTLE SURPRISED BUT VERY DELIGHTED WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FINAL PRODUCT FOR YOU -- THIS WAS TRULY LIKE HERDING CATS BUT BUT WE'RE ALL RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMING TO YES TO AN AGREEMENT ON THIS POST BOTH FOR DRUGS. AND FOR SHARPS SO THAT WE CAN GET RID OF THESE WE CAN DISPOSE OF THEM AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE AND EFFECTIVELY SO. THIS IS A MEASURE THAT CREATES A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE PRODUCER PAID TAKE BACK PROGRAM FOR HOME GENERATED PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS. AND MEDICAL SHARPS. THE BILL WILL SET A STATEWIDE PROGRAM UNDER WHICH CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. WILL BE ABLE TO SAFELY. AND CONVENIENTLY AND THIS IS IMPORTANT IF IT'S NOT CONVENIENT THEY WON'T DO IT. AND CONVENIENTLY DISPOSE OF MEDICAL WASTE AN UNUSED MEDICAL PRODUCTS GIVING SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS KNOW TOO WELL AND I WOULD SOON. SUSPECT EACH AND EVERYONE OF US IF WE'VE EVER IF YOU'VE INDIVIDUALLY BEEN THROUGH A HEALTH ISSUE YOU A FAMILY WHO'S BEEN THROUGH IT. AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU'RE LEFT WITH MEDICATIONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN FULLY CONSUMED OR THAT HAVE EXPIRED WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM OR SHARPS OF OF THAT. ARE OUT THERE AND POWER HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE DANGEROUS BY THE VERY NATURE OF THEIR A BEING. SO I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON RECENT AMENDMENTS WHICH WERE TAKEN TO ADDRESS AGENCY AND STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS. I FIRST WANT TO THANK GOD AS AS THE CHAIRMEN CHURNED A STAFF OF MY COLLEAGUES -- AN IN THE ASSEMBLY THIS HAS BEEN A TRULY A A LABOR OF LOVE AND WILL. GET TO THIS RESULT AND WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE SITTING WITH US TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK THEM AND ALSO THANKED STAFF -- WHO WERE THROWN INTO THIS -- KERFUFFLE OF PROBABLY WITHOUT REALIZING WHAT THEY HAD SIGNED UP FOR SO THIS IS A BILL THAT -- ID. THESE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THE STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS AT THE CHAIR HAD INDICATED WERE OF CONCERN TO HIM SPECIFICALLY. I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THE ROBUST TIER DEFINITION OF WHAT A COVERED MANUFACTURER IS. WHICH HAS BEEN CRAFTED TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF NOT JUST INDUSTRY BUT OF CAL RECYCLE AS WELL. WE'VE ALSO WORKED TO CREATE. A WORKABLE FRAMEWORK TO HANDLE THE SAFE AND COMPREHENSIVE TAKE BACK ALL OF NEEDLES OF THE SHARPS. BOB BUT AUTHORIZING CAL RECYCLE TO APPROVE A MAIL BACK A EXCUSE ME BY AUTHORIZING CAL RECYCLE TO PROVE A MAIL BACK. BASED OF STEWARDSHIP PLAN THAT FOCUSES ON READILY AVAILABLE CONTAINERS. THAT FREE OF CHARGE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANY CONSUMER WHO NEED SOME. WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE ALL AGENCIES INVOLVED HAVE THE AUTHORITY THEY NEED TO CONSULT WITH ONE ANOTHER IT'S OFTEN INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING. AND SOMETIMES I'M INCREDULOUS AT THE FACT THAT THESE AGENCIES DON'T EVEN THINK TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER. OR DON'T WANT TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER SO WE HAVE ENCOURAGED IN TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO GIVE THEM THAT AUTHORITY. WE'VE TAKEN SEVERAL AMENDMENTS TO EXCLUDE SPECIALTY PRODUCTS OR ANIMAL PRODUCTS WHICH ARE NOR BEEN CONCERNED OTHER SEPARATELY REGULATED BY OTHER AREAS OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AND THIS BILL IS A PRODUCT OF MONTHS AND YEARS OF STAKEHOLDERS COMING TOGETHER. OF STRANGLING EACH OTHER COMING BACK TOGETHER THIS IS BEEN. A FAMILY FIGHT OF GREAT PROPORTION BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING TO YES. AND I WANT TO THANK THE PRINCE MY PRINCIPAL COAUTHORS FOR THEIR WORK AS WELL. I THANK THE CHAIR FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT ME TODAY AS JASON'S SCHMELZER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE YET HAIR.

I THINK IS MISTER GRAY SAID THAT THAT THIS ISSUE'S BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE AWHILE BUT IT TOOK. IN OUR COLLECTIVE STAFFS TO REALLY BRING ALL THE TOGETHER TO GET THIS. THE PLACE THAT YOU CAN SEE WHAT THIS FAIRLY EXTRAORDINARY PLACE WILL BE HAPPY. ON A GOVERNMENT'S NOT ONLY GOVERNMENTS BUT GOVERNMENTS THAT DON'T REALLY ALL ARE NECESSARY LINE TOGETHER AGREEING YOU HAVE INDUSTRY AGREEING. ON YOU HAVE -- INDUSTRIES THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO THESE TYPES OF MEASURES FOR THE KIND OF COMING TOGETHER. IN A COMMON SOLUTION AND DISS FOR FOR ME THE CULMINATION OF THREE THREE YEARS WORK ON A LONGER FOR THE SENATOR ALONG WITH MR GRAPE I THINK IT'S AMAZING THAT. WERE ABLE TO GET TO THIS POINT SO I JUST PERSON WANT TO THANK ALL OUR STAFFS AT THINK AGAIN. THE COMMITTEE STAFF HERE FOR REALLY I GET IN THIS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU AND I'VE HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS. BOB HOW IMPORTANT THE WORK OF MY CHIEF CONSULTANT HAS BANNED -- EVEN AFTER THE FIRST SET OF AMENDMENTS -- GOING THROUGH IT LINE BY LINE TO FIND -- OTHER THINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDED IN. I I REALLY WANT TO THANK MY CHIEF CONSULTANT VERY MUCH FOR ALL HIS HARD WORK. ALRIGHT WE NOW NEED TO HEAR FROM OPPOSITION. IT'S FINE YOU NOW WE ALL WHERE THERE WERE HERE TO DO OUR JOBS DO YOU. BUT NO ONE WITH A KNIFE THAT BACK THERE ON NO THAT'S A THAT'S RESERVED OVER THERE. UP CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I THINK YOU VERY MUCH AND I I WOULD ABSOLUTELY CONCURRENT WOULD YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF OFF SORRY ABOUT THAT UPRIGHT MICHELIN WITH THE ASSOCIATION FOR ACCESSIBLE MEDICINES -- THE AM REPRESENTS THE GENERIC AND BIO PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS. I AND AND WE WANTED TO START WITH THE FACT THAT YES YOUR STAFF'S A COMBINED HAVE DONE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF WORK AND AND THAT CERTAINLY APPRECIATED -- THE CONCERNS THAT A. M. HOUSE IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT GENERIC PHARMACEUTICALS I'M AND I'M PRIMARILY GOING TO BE ADDRESSING -- THE THE PHARMACEUTICAL SIDE NOT NECESSARILY THE SHARP SIDE -- NAM. SINCE THOSE BUILT THOSE PORTIONS WERE US SOMEWHAT SEPARATED AB GENERICS HAVE SAVED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE -- TO HUNT OR TWO POINT. BUT ARE TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S THROUGHOUT THE MEDICAID SYSTEM THE MEDICARE SYSTEM. CASH PAYING PATIENTS AND COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS. THE UNFORTUNATE FACT THIS BILL IS THAT. GENERIC MANUFACTURERS ARE GOING TO BE PRIMARILY PAYING FOR THE COSTS OF WHAT IS A VERY BROAD. VERY PRESCRIPTIVE BILL AND THAT. LIKELY WILL HAVE THE RESULT OF INCREASING THE COST OF WATER RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE AND HAS PROVEN OVER THE LAST? A DECADE A DEPRECIATING MARKET AND ONE OF THE ONLY DEPRECIATING MARKETS WITH AND HEALTH CARE. GENERICS OF DEPRECIATED 7% ANNUALLY. THIS BILL HAS THE EFFECT OF REVERSING THAT ARE POTENTIALLY REVERSING THAT TREND. ANA AND DEFINITELY SLOWING THAT TREND. WE HAVE REQUESTED TWO SEPARATE SETS -- TO AMENDMENTS -- THAT WE THINK WOULD HELP ADDRESS COSTS IN THE BILL [inaudible] BOTH. TO HELP*. SPREAD THE COSTS THE OPERATIONAL AND PROGRAMMATIC COSTS ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN [inaudible] GENERICS -- GENERICS IN THIS BILL ARE REQUIRED TO COVER THE COSTS FOR ESSENTIALLY INNING COVERED ENTITY THAT WISHES TO JOIN. EVEN WANT TO PROGRAM'S BEEN APPROVED AND ANNUALLY BY CAL RECYCLE. ANY COVERED ENTITY IS ABLE TO COME AND REQUEST TO BECOME PART OF SENATOR THE PROGRAMS. THAT MEANS ENTITIES SUCH AS WALMART CVS. ANY OTHER LARGE CHAIN DRUGSTORE WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER CORPORATIONS THE MOST GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. CAN BECOME PART OF THE PROGRAM WITH. THE ENTITIES PAYING FOR THE PROGRAM COVERING THOSE COSTS AS WELL. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE. GENERICS RIGHT NOW WHEN WRITTEN -- DISCUSSING THE SUPPLY CHAIN RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF THE REVENUE -- OF TIME THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF OF DRUGS MEANS THOSE OTHER ENTITIES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE COVERING COSTS FOR ARE TAKING TWO THIRDS OF THE REVENUE. THAT THIS BILL IS REQUIRING US TO COVER THE ENTIRE COSTS AGAIN. THE SECOND ASPECT THAT WE'VE LA DISK DISCUSSED ANNA AND WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN COVERED IN THE BILL. IS THE FACT THAT. THERE IS NO -- DEFINITION OF ORDER OR NON ACCEPTANCE OF REVENUE VERSES VOLUME IN IN THE BILL. GENERICS AGAIN TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SAVED. IN ONE YEAR ALONE. THIS BILL IGNORES ANY CONSIDERATION OF REVENUE. WE WOULD REQUEST THAT. THERE BE SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS -- THAT REVENUE VERSUS VOLUME BE ADDRESSED -- IN THE AMOUNT OF OF OF HOW THESE COSTS ARE BEING A I'D DISTRIBUTED. CURRENTLY THERE IS ONE PROGRAM. THAT'S IN EXISTENCE ASIDE PAT WE WE WERE PART OF ADMITTEDLY PART OF OF STARTING -- BUT THAT PROGRAM ALSO. DIVIDE COST BASED ON VOLUME NOT ON REVENUE. GENERICS ARE 90% OF WHAT IS PRESCRIBED IN THE STATE AND NATIONALLY. THAT WE TAKE 23% OF THE REVENUE BRAND MANUFACTURERS. ON THE FLIP SIDE. OR 10% OF WHAT'S PRESCRIBED INTAKE 77% OF THE REVENUE. THAT THIS BILL. AND THE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST WOULD. BUT BECAUSE PRIMARILY ON ON GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. IN THE ANALYSIS THIS BILL COULD YOU TAKE ABOUT ONE MORE MINUTE YOU'VE GOT ABOUT SOLELY ON HER JUST ABOUT DONE OKAY -- ONE I IN THE ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL IT TALKS ABOUT THE INCREASING COST OF DRUGS -- AS ONE OF THE SCOPES OF NEED FOR THIS BILL. OUGHT TO SHOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF DRUGS OUT THERE ARE GOING UP. YET THE BILL COMPLETELY IGNORES THE COST OF DRUGS. AND THE LOWER COST DRUGS NGUYEN. THE PROGRAMS ARE BEING ASKED THE PAID. FOR THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF ACHIEVING SOME THIS [inaudible] EDUCATION. OF BOTH PRESCRIBERS AND PATIENTS PATIENTS SHOULD BE TAKING THE DRUGS THAT ARE PRESCRIBED DESCRIBE FIRST SHOULD NOT BE OVER PRESCRIBING. A PRETTY BASIC FACT. WE BELIEVE THROUGH BETTER EDUCATION AND BETTER KNOWLEDGE BETTER -- THAT IT HEREIN ARE. RECOGNIZING THAT CAL RECYCLING ALREADY HAS IN THERE ARE OVER. SIX HUNDRED THINK BACK CENTERS ALREADY IN THE STATE EXPANDING THOSE SHOULD BE DONE EXPANDING KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE. SHOULD BE DONE. BUT HAVING AN OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE. AND VERY -- BURDEN SLIM BILL FOCUS PRIMARILY AT GENERIC MANUFACTURERS WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S APPROPRIATE AND THOSE ARE THE REASONS THAT WE ARE IN A ASKING FOR A NO VOTE BUT STILL OFFICIALLY IN AND OPPOSE ENLISTMENT. POSITION THANK YOU. UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT VERY CLEAR OTHER. NEXT SPEAKER. THINK THAT YOU TRY TO KEEP IT TO FIVE MINUTES -- THINKS IT'S QUIRK MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LEO AND I'M THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE HEALTH CARE DISTRIBUTION ALLIANCE -- WORD A TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING PRIMARY PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS ESSENTIALLY OUR ROLE IS TO ENSURE THE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND HOSPITALS PHARMACIES AND POINTS OF CARE HAVE. ODD SAFE AND TIMELY ACCESS TO THE MEDICATIONS THEY NEED TO TREAT THEIR PATIENTS. I'M WE ARE HERE AND PARTIALLY IN OPPOSITION UNLESS AMENDED TO SENATE BILL. TWO TWELVE AND HDMI MEMBER COMPANIES REALLY STAND READY TO WORK WITH THE SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. ENSURING THAT THERE IS A SAFE AND SECURE WAY TO DISPOSE OF UNWANTED MEDICATION. WE APPRECIATE THE ONGOING WORK OF THE SPONSORS AND THEIR STAFF AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HELPING AT THE BILL WHERE IT IS TODAY. I BUT WE DO HAVE OUTSTANDING CONCERNS WITH THE LANGUAGE -- BASED ON ESSENTIALLY THE AMBIGUOUS DEFINITIONS ENTAILED AN UNFETTERED REGULATORY PROCESS. IN THE CURRENT DEFINITION LANGUAGE -- COVERED ENTITY PROVIDES A VAGUE DEFINITION AND REQUIRING SEVERAL ENTITIES TO POTENTIALLY BE LIABLE FOR THE PROGRAM. AND THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT OFFER DEFINITIONS TO MANUFACTURER -- NOR DOES IT PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON WHAT. BUT QUALIFIES ITS OWN BEING IN THE STATE [inaudible] I THAT'S AN AREA COULD RESULT IN AN EFFICIENT WAY OF RAISING REVENUE AND ULTIMATELY AT UNNECESSARY COSTS TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. I WE APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE WAS ADDED TO REQUIRE REGULATORY PROCESS TO ESTABLISH PARAMETERS -- AROUND THAT DEFINITION BUT WE BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ON HOW THE DEPARTMENT WILL ENFORCE THAT TIER DEFINITION. BOTH PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY CHAIN IS VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER INDUSTRY CURRENTLY OPERATING A US STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM WITHIN THE STATE. IT'S ONE OF THE HOPE MOST HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRIES SO THERE ARE OF DIFFERENT ISSUES DEPENDING ON WHICH INDUSTRY THAT THE COVERS I WAS WORKING ON AND ULTIMATELY WHOLESALER DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER ENTITIES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. ABU FACILITATE THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED FOR NON COMPLIANCE OF THE ACTUAL MANUFACTURER. OF NOR UTILIZED AS AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. I HATE SEEING OUR MEMBER COMPANIES STAND READY TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH CALPERS CYCLE ON THE REGULATORY PROCESS AS WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THIS PROGRAM IT'S VIABLE FOR THE STATE. TO THINK IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A WHAT SORT OF COMPANIES ARE MEMBERS OF YOUR ORGANIZATION. SIR I'M WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS SO WE HAVE OUR ARE OKAY YOU. GOT IT THANK YOU ABSOLUTE. OR ARM OTHERS IN OPPOSITION OKAY. ARM SO NOW WE GO TO THE COMMITTEE -- ANY QUESTIONS -- MADAM VICE CHAIR NOW -- MR PEROT. I HAD TAKEN THIS CHAIR. YEAH FIRST SENATOR AND MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE -- APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO GET TO AN AGREEMENT ON THIS BILL. UP COUPLE COMMENTS IN A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SO FIRST MY HOME THE DATA POINT WHERE PROGRAM -- THERE'S A BOX AT CITY HALL OF THAT FOLKS. CAN DROP OFF -- SCRIPT PROBLEM NEEDLES AND USE DRUGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN A DEPUTY SHERIFF WILL TAKE IN THE SAND AND THEN ULTIMATELY TO LONG BEACH BE INCINERATED. AND THE CITY'S ROLE IS TO ONE PROVIDE A PLACE BUT TO MARKET IT. TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT -- THE SO THAT'S THE WAY WE DO IT LOCALLY BUT MY ONE QUESTION IS -- SINCE WE'RE DEALING WITH -- NEEDLES AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Y. CAL RECYCLE MAYBE MORE MEDICAL BOARD MIGHT BE A PROPER PLACE TO COME UP WITH THESE REGULATIONS WHY WAS CAL RECYCLE CHOSEN. WELL CAO RECYCLE ACTUALLY HAS BEEN DOING RECYCLING PROGRAM SO THEY ARE THE MOST LOGICAL. OF ON THE GROUND JUST LIKE IT COULD WE HAVE YOUR EXPERTS COME UP HERE IN WITH -- SAY WE NEED TO TO GET ANOTHER CHAIR BUT MISTER SCHMELZER. AND SURE. BUT I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAD SOME OF YOUR EXPERTS APPEAR. MR TINGS AN EXPERT. SO CAL CAL RECYCLE IS. IN CALIFORNIA THE FOREMOST EXPERT ON OF THIS KIND OF RESPONSE FIAMME PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY WE DO. ON KANSEN CLASS AND ALL THIS KIND OF THING AND IF YOU JUST SUBSTITUTE. A SHARP SHOULDN'T BECAUSE DRUGS OBVIOUSLY THE GOAL IS TO ADEQUATELY DISPOSE OF THESE PRODUCTS THEY ARE THE MOST THEY ARE THE EXPERTS IN THIS PARTICULAR FIELD. ARM OUT WE'VE WORKED WITH THE BOARD OF PHARMACY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THEY ARE ALSO. A VERY INTEGRALLY INVOLVED IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS SO CAL RECYCLE THEIR THE EXPERTS IN THIS IN THIS AREA AND TO WORKING WITH AS YOU MENTION MEDICAL -- GROUPS OF DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND BOARD OF PHARMACY ARE THE SORT OF THE I GUESS THE SPECIFIC EXPERTS CAL RECYCLED KNOWS HOW TO DO THIS KIND OF A MANAGEMENT OF OF OF UNUSED. AND AND THE NEED TO A DISPOSAL THEM SAFELY IN AN APPROPRIATELY FOCA DOES MY CONCERN THAT THE SOME OF THE MEDICAL EXPERTISE BECAUSE THESE ARE YOU KNOW PLASTIC BOTTLES ALUMINUM CAN PRINT. AND FRANKLY CALORIE CYCLE I THINK YOU KNOW ALL MY PLACES ARE CLOSE WE CAN IN TURN IN THE CAN SO. SUBTLE LITTLE CONCERN THERE UP MY SECOND QUESTION MIGHT SECOND FINAL QUESTION IS A WAS ACTUALLY FOR MR TING ON SOME FOLKS. AND DESCRIBED THE ISSUE YOU HAVE IN SAN FRANCISCO -- WITH NEEDLES [inaudible] AND IT IS YOUR IS YOUR SITUATION A MEDICAL SITUATION OR IS IT FOLKS THAT ARE USING ILLEGAL DRUGS AND THROWING THE NEEDLES ON THE SIDEWALK AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW I I DON'T HAVE EXACT DATA BUT IF I HAD -- ON I GUESS IT IS MORE -- PEOPLE WHO ARE -- GIVEN NEEDLES AND THEN NOT DISPOSING THEM -- PROPER THE PUBLIC BE MORE THE LATTER RIGHT IT'S I THINK THAT'S WHY I'M. HE WAS AGREED UPON TO DO A MAIL BACK PROGRAM WAS SHARPS. OBVIOUSLY -- SO FAR ARE PARTICULAR EXAMPLE WHICH IS HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE IT'S NOT JUST ON MAILING BACK THE SHARP BUT REALLY A LOT MORE EDUCATION. AND HAVING A LOT MORE SITES FOR PEOPLE TO DISPOSE OF THIS BECOME PART UP QUITE ISSUE IS A BET NOW THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD -- THE CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE ASKING PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES YOU KNOW TO PAY. FOR DRUG USERS NEEDLES THAT ARE NOT PLEASE. THIS WILL BE IMPROPER BUT THAT'S THAT'S CONCERNED QUOTE ME YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW MAYBE. AREN'T STOP SIGN SCREEN BOX ON STOP SIGNS OR THINGS LIKE THAT BUT NO I LOVE TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS AND I THINK I THINK ARM I THINK THAT'S A APPOINT WILL TAKE AND THAT'S WHY WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY. ON WITH INDUSTRY FOR OVER THREE YEARS TO REACH THIS POINT OUR FARM. I PRODUCE RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE'VE WE'VE GOT INDUSTRY -- BY IN ON THAT BUT A BE OBSOLETE RIGHT. THAT WE DO NEED TO BE A MORE. THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT OFF THE STREET I KNOW OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS A NUMBER OF PLACES WHERE SHARPS CAN BE -- DISPOSE BUT YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES YOU HAVE JUST. IMPROPER HUMAN BEHAVIOR LITTLE THEN THE NOCTURNAL WALK THE EXTRA TWO BOXERS COUPON THE STREETLIGHTS WERE SO THAT THAT'S THE BIGGER ISSUE WITH SELF THANK YOU [inaudible] BOB. THEN THE DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND THEN -- MISSED MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANTED TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR HEARING LOSS IN THE LAST COMMITTEE HEARING AND IT'S MAKING AMENDMENTS THAT MANY OF US WERE ASKING -- FOR TYPE SPECIFICALLY I'M QUITE A EXCITED ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS REMOVING AGRICULTURE FROM THIS BILL JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR DOING IT. I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THIS BILL TODAY MISTER CHAIR WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE GO AHEAD I MOVE THIS BILL. BUT I DO WANT SECONDS. I DO WANT TO RAISE A CONCERN IF I CAN. I AM CURRENTLY WERE FACING SOME MEDICAL SHORTAGES. INABILITY TO RECEIVE CERTAIN MEDICATIONS INTO CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. I HOPE THAT ADDING MORE REGULATORY BURDEN WILL NOT EXACERBATE THAT PROBLEM AND WILL BE LOOKING TOWARDS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT. PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO ACCESS GENERICS AND BRAND NAME PHARMACEUTICALS ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. WHILE I APPRECIATE THE SCOPE AND SEVERITY OF THIS PROBLEM AND THE NEED FOR THIS FIX THIS YEAR. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AS WE IMPLEMENT THIS THAT WERE. NOT FORGETTING THAT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE PRESCRIPTIONS THAT NEED TO BE FILLED AS WELL. SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK THE AUTHOR AND CO AUTHORS FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND LOOK FORWARD TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION. MERIT. MISTER MURATSUCHI THAT. THE BILL MOVING FORWARD -- TO BUT I WANTED. TO NO RACISM -- ONGOING CONCERNS I HAVE -- SPECIFICALLY. ARE THE DEFINITION OF COVERED ENTITY IN THE BILL -- IT IT SEEMS TO BE -- A RATHER BROAD AND AND IT IT HAS TO PROVISIONS ACCORDING TO COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OF A YOU KNOW A COVERED ENTITY IF IF THERE'S NOT A MANUFACTURER FOR COVERED PROJECT. A PRODUCT IN THE COVERED ENTITY WOULD BE THE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE COVERED PRODUCT SOLD INTO THE STATE AND DOWN. YOU KNOW AGE IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THE THAT -- YOU KNOW THE BASIC. EP OUR PRINCIPLES SAID THAT IT SHOULD BE THE MANUFACTURE RATHER THE DISTRIBUTOR THAT THAT WOULD BE HELD THE LIABLE FOR A ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE YEAR -- IT'D THIS SIR EFFORT BUT TAG WANTED ASK [inaudible] SENATE JACKSON. WELL I I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE THE MANUFACTURE PRACTICALLY SPEAKING SOME OF THESE MEDICATIONS AREN'T. MADE HERE AND TO GO AFTER THEM IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT IN A PART OF THIS AND AND TO RESPOND AND I APPRECIATE DR ROMULUS. CONCERN OF THE BILL ALSO DOES CALL FOR OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS MAY VERY WELL BE ABLE -- TO OR MAY STILL NOT BE ABLE TO DISCERN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST SHARE BURDENS ON DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS. BY AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS ACCORDINGLY SO IT IS OUR OUR OUR HOPE THAT AS THIS. AS THIS MOVES FORWARD AND WE SEE HOW THIS ALL COMES TOGETHER THAT THERE BE THAT SENSE OF EQUITY AND THERE BE THAT SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY ME WE ARE TRUE THIS IS TRULY A TRANSFORMATIVE. UP BILL ON DEALING WITH PHARMACEUTICALS AND SHARKS I MEAN THAT THERE IS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS SO WE ARE WE HAVE TRIED TO ANTICIPATE A LOT OF THOSE PROBLEMS. AYE AND A RESPONDBUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE FIGURED IT ALL OUT AND WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WAS KEEP IT FLEXIBLE ENOUGH SO THAT WE CAN COME BACK AS NECESSARY. TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE COST TO THE GENERIC THE CAUSES PROGRAM'S REALLY MINUSCULE -- RECOGNIZING THAT THE THAT THE PROFIT MARGIN ON GENERICS IS LESS THAT IT DOES RELATIVELY IMPACT THEM A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- TO LESS THAN HALF A PENNY PER EVERY PRESCRIPTION -- SO -- AFFAIR EVERY PRESCRIPTION DOLLAR I SHOULD SAY SO IT'S IT'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT BUT WE WERE TRYING TO GET THE MANUFACTURERS AND THE THE WHOLE PRODUCTION LINE. TO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ONLY. PROVIDING ACCESS TO THESE MEDICATIONS IN THESE AYE INSTRUMENTS THEY HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THEY'VE GOT A WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH THEIR USEFUL LIFE BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM AND THEY ARE DANGER. ALRIGHT WELL I IT LIKE LIKE EVERYONE'S BEEN SAYING I I THINK THE KEY HERE -- THE IS THAT WE ARE MOVING GO. YOU'RE GETTING OUT THE GATE AND AND WITH WITH PERHAPS THE DETAILS. A TO BE ADDRESSED FOLLOWED LEGISLATION OR AYE THROUGH THE REGULATIONS AT THAT WOULD BE DEVELOPED THROUGH CAL RECYCLE BUTTA. I LOOK FORWARD TO A ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES. SO YOU KNOW MY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE DON'T. YOU KNOW THE PROGRAM'S GONNA BE PAID. FOR BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS. ARM ON WHO HAS WHAT BURDEN. AND THAT'S GOT TO BE WORKED OUT. COULD YOU SAY A LITTLE BIT MORE AOUT THAT PROCESS SENATOR JACKSON'S. WELL I THINK AT THIS POINT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL UPON IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT I'VE GOT IT RIGHT UP AND WE ARE LOOKING CAL RECYCLE TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM. AND YOU DID YOU WANT TO BRING IN EXPERT UP WE HAVE. WITH MR SHUTTLES ARE. TO TALK ABOUT THIS PROCESS YES WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE IT EXACTLY RIGHT NO I AGREE. SO COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT PROCESS BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE. A MAJOR CONCERN OF THE OPPOSITION RIGHT NOW AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS. YEAH AND THAT I OBVIOUSLY MAKE ROOM FOR THE INDUSTRY A MY UNDERSTANDING IS WHAT. SOME UNDERSTANDING PERIOD POINT BLANK THERE'S NO COST ALLOCATION IN THE BILL IT IS LEFT UP TO PRIVATE CONTRACT BETWEEN THE INTERESTED PARTIES. THEY CAN EITHER GET TOGETHER UP AND MAKE A DECISION ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS OR THEY CAN -- THERE'S ROOM FOR THEM TO COMPLY THEM INDIVIDUALLY -- THERE IS EXISTING PRECEDENT BECAUSE OF THE PP SWG WHICH A PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP WITH. TO THE LETTER THE OTHER IF THE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS YOUR CHIP WORKING GROUP BERENGER AND THAT YOU TOGETHER WE FIGURE THAT OUT. UP IN MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OCCURRED THERE -- IS THAT THERE IS AN INDEPENDENT PROCESS THAT INCLUDED AYE I BELIEVE AND AGAIN I'LL DEFER TO THE INDUSTRY OR ANYBODY ELSE WHO KNOWS IN MORE DETAIL. UP THAT INCLUDED AN INDEPENDENT KIND OF ALMOST AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AND EVERYBODY PRESENTED THEIR CASE ON WHAT THE COST ALLOCATION SHOULD BE -- SO ALL THE COMPANIES AS WE WOULD SUSPECT GOT TOGETHER WITH THEIR LAWYERS AND FIGURE IT OUT. I DAY HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT YET OR WELL THAT THE PPS TO BG OPERATES ALL THE LOCAL PROGRAMS. THE NINE EXISTING AND YES THERE IS AN EXISTING COST ALLOCATION THAT WAS DONE. ON THROUGH AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANIES. AND DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHETHER THAT'LL BE THE SAME AGREEMENT WHEN WE GO TO THE STATE WHY PROCESS. AND I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE. TO ANSWER THE FIRST ONE OF THE THINGS WE SHIED AWAY FROM IN THIS BILL WAS CHANGING THAT ALLOCATION MODEL AND LEADING THE INDUSTRY DETERMINE ON THEIR OWN. HOW THAT SHOULD BE DONE SO IT IT IT IT COULD BE CHANGED? THE BILL ASIDE THE BILL IS SILENT SO IF PEOPLE. SO THERE'S NINE PROGRAMS NOW ENDING NOW A STATEWIDE PROGRAM THAT COULD BE NEW NEGOTIATIONS ON THE STATE WIDE PROGRAM. THEN YOU HAVE A CONCERN I NOW. OR JUST A LITTLE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PP SWG WAS SET UP TO DEAL WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY. AND THEIR THE ONES WHO OPERATE ALAMEDA COUNTY AND AS YOU'VE RECOGNIZED THERE ARE CONCERNS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY IT IS OR HAS IT ALL AS ITS CONTINUE. TO TO TAKE BACK AROUND AROUND THE NATION AND AND COUNTIES UP. I HAVE CONTINUE -- TO BE IMPLEMENTED PP SWG HAS GROWN BUT IT IS A BOARD THAT'S LARGELY DOMINATED BY THE BRAND FROM CYNICAL COMPANIES -- AND PART OF THAT YES AS A AS I SAID EARLY ON THE GENERICS DID PARTICIPATE. IN SOME OF THE FORMATION BUT AGAIN THAT WAS. TO DEVELOPED WITH THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY AT THE TIME AND IT'S IT'S GROWN WE WE DON'T KNOW IF PP SWG IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO GROW WITH IT. WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL BE THE ONE ENTITY OR WE DON'T KNOW IF EACH INDIVIDUAL MANUFACTURERS GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP WITH ITS OWN PROGRAM. AND MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE STATE WHICH IS WHAT LEADS TO SOME OF THE REAL COST CONCERNS IN THE BILL FOR GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. AND THAT IS SENATOR JACKSON MENTION. SOME OF THIS WHETHER IT'S A HALF A CENT PER PRESCRIPTION. GENERIC SERB PER DOLLAR WELL A PER DOLLAR CHECK OUT THE PER TEN DOLLARS ACCORDING TO THE STIPULATIONS OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY ORDINANCE IT'S HALF A CENT PER TEN DOLLARS. OKAY THANK YOU. GENERICS ARE OFTEN PRICED AT OPINION PILL [inaudible] PERIOD [inaudible] AND GENERIC SURVIVE BASED ON VOLUME. AND THE NUMBER OF OF PILLS AND AND IS THAT THAT ARE BEING PRESCRIBED THEY DON'T MAKE LARGE MARGINS ON ANY OF THESE PRESCRIPTIONS SO I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT. IT IS BASED UPON. PRICE IS THAT THE ACTUAL PRICE OF THE PRICE THAT THE PERSON PAIN AT THE COUNTER SET. WHICH PRICES IT. I HAVE SAID PRETEND DOLLARS I'M JUST TELLING YOU IT WAS STIPULATED IN THE FORMAT LAWSUIT AGAINST ALAMEDA COUNTY WAS THE BASS STIPULATED THE COST OF THE PROGRAM WAS HALF A CENT PER TEN DOLLARS I'M NOT SURE BEYOND THAT. I CAN DO WELL IS THAT YOU THE ACTUAL COURT DOCUMENT NO BUT IS THAT THE ACTUAL COST OF THE DRUG OR WHAT THE CONSUMER PAYS WITH INSURANCE. I'M NOT I'M NOT CLEAR ALRIGHT. IF SOMEBODY KNOWS [inaudible] OKAY. ALRIGHT THEN THE WHOLESALER WOULD YOU REPRESENTATIVE DO YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING HERE NOW OKAY. OUR YOU DO WE HAVE ANOTHER EXPERT [inaudible] NOW. THE COMPANY IT'S ABOUT THE ALAMEDA COURT CASE. IT IT A MIGHTY SANBORN WITH THAT CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL CAN AND THE THE DRUG COMPANIES STIPULATED TO THE FACT THAT. LESS THAN A PENNY FOR EVERY TEN DOLLARS SOLD IS WHAT THE ENTIRE PROGRAM WOULD COST FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY SOLD. HE SAT WITH THE CONSUMERS PAIN OR IS THAT THE ACTUAL COST OF THE MEDICATION THE CONSUMERS PRICE PLUS WHAT INSURANCE PAYS. THAT IS THE ACTUAL COSTS THAT THE DRUG COMPANIES WOULD PAY EXTRA. THEY'VE INTERNALIZED INTERNAL BUT BASED UPON WHICH PRICE TO RUN THE CONSUMER PAYS TO THE ONE THE CONSUMER PLUS THE INSURANCE COMPANY PAYS FOR THE LIST PRICE OF THE DRUG. WHAT PRICE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHECK I DON'T THINK I OKAY SO WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT LET'S TRY AND GET AN ANSWER BEFORE IT COMES TO THE FLOOR? IF I MAY GENERIC MANUFACTURERS AND A. M. WAS NOT PARTY TO THOSE THAT LAWSUIT OR OKAY I UNDERSTAND. ALRIGHT -- I THINK WE'VE GONE THIS FAR AND THAT IS WE CAN -- YES I GREE WE NEED TO GET TO WATCH -- THANK GOD I'LL BE BRIEF AND CLOSING. PART OF THE BEAUTY OF THIS AS WE SAID WE SHUT OUT THE PARAMETERS AND WE SAID TO THE INDUSTRIES YOU FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WANT TO PAY FOR THIS. THAT'S PART OF THE BILL THE BEAUTY OF THE PROGRAM WHERE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE REQUIRING TO YOU DO. YOU COME TOGETHER YOU FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS WORK SO GENERICS IN ANY OF THE PARTIES CONCERNED UP THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT PLAN UNDER THIS BILL. YOU KNOW THAT WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT HOW WE'RE TRYING TO STIFLE COMPANIES AND OVER REGULATE THEM HERE WHICH IS SETTING THE PARAMETERS AND SAYING YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND WITH THAT. I WOULD DIE OFF A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT WILL GET YOU THE ANSWER TO THAT THE BOTTOM LINE THOUGH IS THE PRICE OF THIS THE OF THE TAKE BACK PROGRAMS IS MINUSCULE. COMPARED TO THE PROFITS OF THESE COMPANIES MAKE AND TO PROVIDE A COMPARATIVE THE AMOUNT THAT'S OUT THERE AND ALSO COMPARED TO THE COST WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO COME TO EMERGENCY ROOMS. BECAUSE THEY'VE MISUNDERSTOOD THERE MIGHT THINK IT TOO MANY MEDICATIONS IN THEIR OF MEDICINE CABINETS THEY DON'T NECESSARILY GO TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO RID REMOVE THEIR DRUGS -- OR TO HAVE THEIR SHARPS OF GOT TO DO SOMETHING THE CLEAN THIS UP THIS BILL HAS UP A WIDE BERTH THE SUPPORT WE'VE WORKED REALLY HARD ON IT. IF WE NEED TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS GOING FORWARD I KNOW THAT WE HAVE THAT DESIRE INCOME AND CERTAINLY THE COMMITMENT TO DO SO WITH THAT I'D ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE OKAY SO I'M VERY MUCH RECOMMENDED AN AYE VOTE. WE NEED TO GET THIS TO THE FLOOR WE CANNOT LIVE WITH. FORTY FIFTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WHATEVER MORE NUMBER NUMBER IF YOU DON'T DO THIS YEAH EXACTLY INCLUDING THE CITY AT THE COUNTY OF LA WHICH IS A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION THE STATE THIS NEEDS TO GO. FORWARD I DO RESPECT THE CONCERNS OF THE WHOLESALERS IN THE GENERIC DRUGS. AND I AM WILLING TO HOLD A HEARING ON THIS -- EARLY NEXT YEAR FINDING OUT HOW THE COST STOCK ALLOCATION IS DONE -- HEARING FROM OUR MEMBERS AND OTHERS I THINK THIS IS OUR I AM VERY GLAD YOU RAISED THIS ISSUE AND I PROMISE YOU WE WILL FOLLOW UP ON IT.
