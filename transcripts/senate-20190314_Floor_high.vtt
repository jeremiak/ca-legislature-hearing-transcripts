HE CAME INTO THE WORLD A DRUMMER.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.521
HE COULD DRUM BEFORE EVEN COULD

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:39.291
SET UP.

00:22:39.357 --> 00:22:41.560

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:47.632
AND HIS DESIRE TO BRING WHAT HE

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:50.368
CALLED MUSIC MEDICINE.

00:22:50.435 --> 00:22:52.971
IS WHAT BROUGHT HIM TO UCLA TO

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:58.110
STUDY MUSIC OR USC POLICIES.

00:22:58.176 --> 00:22:59.845

ARE MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM GUN

00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:12.357

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:18.697
THAT IS A 63% HIGHER LIKELIHOOD.

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:21.500

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:23.101
IT'S AN EPIDEMIC.

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:25.971
