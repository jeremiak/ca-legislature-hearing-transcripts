IN REVEREND KING'S OWN WORDS MRS PARKS WAS IDEAL FOR THE ROLE ASSIGNED TO HER BY HISTORY. BECAUSE OUR HER CHARACTER WAS IMPECCABLE AND HER DEDICATION DEEP ROOTED.

DAVIS RAYOS DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER IN MEMBERS I TO RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AND THANKING OUR MEMBER MISTER COOPER. FOR BRINGING THIS PARTICULAR ACR FORWARD. IT IS BE FITTING THAT AS WE BEGIN THE MONTH OF BLACK HISTORY THAT WE LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE ROSA PARKS AS AN EXAMPLE OF AN ORDINARY PERSON DOING AN EXTRAORDINARY THING. THAT SHE BASICALLY HELPED US BEGIN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA IN THIS NATION. AND DIED WE CELEBRATE HER BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THAT SHE DID THIS NOT BECAUSE SHE WAS TIRED OF OUT. JUST TIRED LEAD TO MORE TIRED THAN ANY OF THE TIME AND FACTOR BIOGRAPHY SHE TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING REALLY THAT UNIQUE ABOUT THE DAY. THAT SHE HAD BEEN TIRED AND WE LEARNED SOME OF THEM FANNIE LOU HAMER THAT OFTENTIMES BLACK PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF BEING SICK AND TIRED OF BEING SICK AND TIRED. THAT THE ISSUE OF EXHAUSTION FROM RACISM IS SOMETIMES SO OVERWHELMING THAT IT MAKES YOU BETTER AND TIRED AND SOMETIMES PARALYZED IN TERMS OF YOUR ABILITY TO ACT. SO IT IS FORTUNATE FOR US THAT SHE DID NOT ALLOW HER HER ANGER AND HER CONCERN ABOUT THE DIGNITY AND BEING EXPECTED TO BASICALLY MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION. YOU KNOW REPRESENTS AND MANY IS THE EXAMPLE LOTS OF VISUAL WORK THE SOME THEY ARE. AT THE END. TIRED OF BEING A- WHO WAS NOT OF C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. THE ISSUE HER BAY.&lt;/c&gt;</u> BEING AN OLD WOMAN AND SHE WAS NOT SHE WAS IN HER EARLY FORTIES AT THE TIME- SHE WAS A WOMAN WHO WAS EDUCATED AND YET HAD LIVED IN A SOCIETY THAT DID NOT RESPECT TO EDUCATION. AND THEREFORE COULD NOT GET A PROFESSIONAL JOB AND WORKED AS A SEAMSTRESS AS A RESULT OF THAT. WE ALSO DON'T DON'T OFTEN CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT SHE WAS A DISRUPTOR AND ACTIVISTS. SHE WORK FOR THE IN DOUBLE ACP SHE UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER BE HERE. AND SHE WAS WILLING TO BASICALLY STAND UP WHEN SO MANY OTHERS NOT WILLING TO STAND UP. AND FIGHT FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT SHE KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SO MANY OTHERS HAVE DONE THE SAME. IT MAY BE TO PUT TAKEN OFF THE LIST THEY WOULD BE INCARCERATED MAYBE SOMETIMES BEATEN. THEY WAS. WAS AND JUST. EXAMPLE OF MEAT HAPPEN AND ALL OF THE WOMEN SO MAY. WHEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. WHO WHAT BASICALLY MOVE FORWARD. MY FRIEND'S MOTHER WAS A PART OF HER GRANDMOTHER WAS A PART OF THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT. AND THEY OFTEN TALKED ABOUT HOW. THOSE WOMEN IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS STOOD EVERY DAY FOR THIRTEEN MONTHS WAITING AND WALKING TO WORK. MILES AND MILES OF WORK. THAT THEY WALKED BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO RIDE THE BUS. THEY TOOK THEY TOOK A STAND THAT WAS IT INCONVENIENT POSITION FOR THEM. WE OFTEN THINK OF IT AS BEING MAYBE ROCK WILL ORGANIZE AND THEY HAD CARS AT ALL THOSE THINGS TO TAKE PEOPLE TO WORK. AND THAT HE ACTUALLY EVOLVED INTO THAT. WHAT THEIR DESIRE TO NOT TAKE THE BUS. WAS ONE THAT WAS PERSONAL. IT WAS SACRIFICIAL BUT THEY WERE DETERMINED. AND I'VE TALKED TO SO MANY ELDERS I WAS DOING SO BY WORK IN RESEARCH AND CIVIL RIGHTS.THAT WERE PART OF THAT THEY WALK AND THEY OFTEN WALKED. THROUGHS THEY CARRY. THAT WALK ALL THE PLACES THAT WOULD NOT WELL PAID. BUT NONE THE LESS THEY WERE DETERMINED TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT THEY WOULD. RIDE THE BUS THAT THEY WERE TIRED OF BEING. L. L. INSULTED AND HAVING THEIR DIGNITY TAKEN AWAY. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ROSA PARKS AND WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE STUFF RIGHTS. INDIVIDUAL WE SHOULD BE. HIGHER I AT LEAST IN STE. BY CHAP. THE THEY TOOK. I ALSO USED TO TELL MY- ABOUT MY- JOURNEY USED. A AND- I WOULD OFTEN CONTENT. AND DRIVE UP THE HILL. TO THE- BUS. EVERY DAY I SEE THESE QUOTES ROSE UP. WAY BEING OFF OF THE BUS. WHO WOULD I WOULD APPROACH. X. WALK THOSE LAWS AT BAY TO GO IN SOMEBODY ELSE. HOUSE AND IN OUR RIGHTS HE'S LOS ANGELES IS THE SEAL. AND THEY WOULD DO EVERY DAY. THEY WANT TO CHECK IN. BASIC REVENUE. STOP THEM A LOT AND GIVE HIM A RIDE HE'LL- NAY WHAT I SAY ME. LITTLE GIRL YOU WILL BE SOMEBODY THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING WE DO. AND THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TIRED THEY NEVER STOPPED. AND I ALWAYS MYSELF YOU KNOW IT LOOKS I'M- BEEN DOING SOME. BUT I HAVE A MY THAT I MADE BUSY AND I MAY BE OVER. BUT I'LL NEVER TIRED. I WOULD NEVER LIE THE WAY OF THIS WORLD TO DETERMINE THE FACT THAT I WILL NOT STAND AND I WILL NOT FIGHT. AND SO WE'VE BEEN HAVE THIS EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE IN AFRICAN AMERICANS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. WHO FLOCKED TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN AN OPPORTUNITY WHO FOUGHT TO GIVE THEM AN EDUCATION WILL FLOCK TO OPEN DOORS AND WE STAND ON THEIR SHOULDERS EVERY TIME. WE FIGHT FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AND JUST. AS WE APPROACH AB THREE NINE TWO LAST YEAR. I HAD TO REMEMBER ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY DO SHOULD FREIGHT. THINGS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU AND I SAID I'M NOT THE COURAGEOUS ONE. THEY WERE THE COURAGEOUS ONES BECAUSE THINGS COULD HAVE REALLY HAPPENED TO THEM. AND WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF FOLKS WHO PLANTED THE SEED ON THE GROUND FREEDOM AND WE'RE DETERMINED TO MOVE THE AGENDA. AND MOST OF US WE THINK ABOUT IT WE DON'T HAVE TO SACRIFICE A WHOLE LOT THE STATE WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS PASSED. AND THIS NOW WE NEED PEOPLE STAND WE NEED THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN THE CHALLENGE AND KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT IS JUST. COULDN'T TO THE FUTURE. AT NO. WHAT HAPPENED AT THE RESULT OF HER TAKING THE STATE AND- WHICH- CHANGE THE CHAIN THE COLOR. OF THE SO. TO CHANGE THE ISSUES ARE THE LOS THIS LAND. AND THIS SIMPLE. THIS STILL ORDER PER.
