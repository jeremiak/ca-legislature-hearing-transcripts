VICE CHAIR NIELSEN IS- IT IS IT WHAT IS THE FARM BUREAU'S POSITION ON THIS BILL AND IF YOU ARE NOT IN SUPPORT CAN YOU PLEASE STATE WHY- PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU AGAIN ROBERT SPIEGEL CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION. TO THE TO THE QUESTION POSED BY MR HILTON AND THE VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE THE FARM BUREAU IS COMMITTED ON SB FIVE THIRTY NINE SIMPLY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A LANGUAGE THAT IS FURTHER EEDED TO CLARIFY THE PROVISIONS IMPROPER NINETEEN. ARMS AS AN ORGANIZATION SERVICE YOU KNOW- THE POSITION THAT WE TOOK ON PROP NINETEEN OF STATIC IS. DICTATED TO US BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ON PROPOSITION NINETEEN THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION WAS NEUTRAL ON THAT. PARTICULAR PROVISION- IN THAT OVER ON THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY BALLOTS ARE. MISTER VICE CHAIR WE'RE GONNA TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO YOU IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS OF MR SPIEGEL IN VIEW DON'T MIND MISTER VICE YOUR KEYS FOR YOUR MIGHT CLOSE YOUR MOUTH I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT BUT AND IT'S A VICE CHAIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. FOR MR SPIEGEL MISTAKE OF THE FARM BUREAU THEN ON PROP NINETEEN WAS NEUTRAL TECHNO PHYSICIAN. THAT IS CORRECT MISTER NELSON AND WHY WOULD YOU TAKE NO POSITION I STILL VIEW THAT AS HARMFUL TO AGRICULTURAL SUCCESSION. IT'S A FAIR QUESTION AND IT WAS ONE THAT WAS ONE I THINK ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISIONS OF OUR ORGANIZATION OF THE BOARD. THE GOOD AND THE BAD ASSOCIATED THE INITIATIVE REQUIRED AND EXAMINATION OF THE PORTABILITY AND RECIPROCITY PROVISIONS OF OTHER REAL PROPERTY SWITCH- ARE DEFINITELY TAX BENEFITS TOO MANY FAMILY FARMERS AND FAMILIES BUT AT THE SAME TIME. THE PROVISIONS RELATED TO FAMILY FARM FOR A BIT CONFUSING- TO REALLY SPEAK TO THAT. THE DISCUSSION AT THE BOARD WAS THAT THERE MAY BE SOME BENEFIT PROVIDED TO FAMILY FARMERS AS WELL WHAT THE INTENT WAS BEHIND PROP NINETEEN. THE INTENTION BEHIND PROP TEAM PROP NINETEEN AS RELATED TO FAMILY FARMS WAS TO ALLOW THE NEXT GENERATION OF FAMILY FARMERS TO CONTINUE IN OPERATION WITHOUT% BEING FINANCIALLY DISADVANTAGED THAT WAS THE INTENT THAT'S WHAT WE SHARED TO MY ORGANIZATION AND TO THE FARMING AND RANCHING COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. GIVEN THAT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO OUR BOARD OUR MEMBERSHIP WE FELT THAT THE FARMING COMMUNITY AND- THE GREATER AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY CALIFORNIA WOULD BE PROTECTED- THAT HAS BEEN OUR UNDERSTANDING IN THE INITIATIVE. UNTIL WE STARTED BEING THE INFORMATION FROM THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION ASSEMBLY WHAT THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN THE L. D. A IS THAT THE LETTER WAS ACTORS. THAT DEFINITELY- RAISED SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS I HOPE THAT I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION SIR. YES IT DOES TO ME IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THIS WOULD BE VERY DETRIMENTAL TO SUCCESSOR SHIP. AND THE FARMS DON'T NORMALLY JUST PASSED FROM ONE PARENT TO A CHILD EITHER GENERALLY OR MORE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY. AND A THIRD OF THE DIFFICULTY WAS A TRICKLE THE REQUIREMENT OF RESIDENCY- IN THE IN THE IN THE IN THE HALL. WAS THAT NOT PART OF THE ISSUE. BAKULA AND TO- CITADEL HURTS CREDIT AND TO MISTER. CREDIT THERE WAS. THIS PROVISIONS TO THAT ISSUE INCLUDED AN ATHLETE FIVE THIRTY. WHICH STATE SPECIFIC THAT THE FAMILY FARM NEED NOT ALSO BE BE PERSONAL RESIDENCE- OF THE TRANSFER TRANSFEREE THERE IS INTENDED TO BE WITHIN PROP NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT BUT BENEFIT IF YOU WILL TO THE FAMILY FARM IN THAT THE HOME AND RESIDENTS TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE FAMILY FARM PROPERTY ITSELF. WOULD BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NECESSARILY BOTH- YOU TEST PROVISIONS ONE FOR A PERSONAL RESIDENCE AND ONE FOR THE FAMILY FARM. THE I DO OF. THE CHAIRS AND THE MAJORITY LEADER'S INTEREST IN TRYING TO. SQUARE THIS UP THE THOUGHT THAT'S ALL I HAVE BETTER MISTER CHAIRMAN IS RIGHT SURE WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. AS YOU JENNA COMMITTEE BEFORE WE TURN IT BACK TO SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR CLOSE WE'D LIKE TO BE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY FINAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE DOING A LAST CALL QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HEARING SEEN NINE MR MAJORITY LEADER FLOOR'S YOURS VEHICLES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS IN THE QUESTIONS AND OUR EFFORTS TO CLARIFY I MEAN LOOK OFTEN WHEN CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AS I SAID IN MY OPENING ARE DRAFTED TO A WE NEED STATUTORY LANGUAGE CLARIFY THAT WE'RE GIVING EMERGENCY REGULATORY POWER TO THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THAT MR JOINER BURKE REPRESENTING THE ASSESSORS- THE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SUPPORT ARM OF THIS MEASURE THE- FIREFIGHTERS IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THE VILLAGERS IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AN EFFORT TO CLEAN UP THEY'RE STILL I SUSPECT IS I HOPE AS I SAID IN MY OPENING. A FEW OTHER ISSUES THE POINT ABOUT TIME IS CERTAINLY BEING TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION WITH RESPECT TO CREATING THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE CAN WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS THAT OF THE VOTERS THAT WE'RE DOING HERE AND SO I AND I JUST WANT TO STRESS THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE MOVING AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN- IN IN IN INTEREST TO TRY TO DEAL WITH ANY UNCERTAINTY THIS MEASURE WAS EXPEDITED TO THE RULES COMMITTEE EXPEDITED AS UPSET. AS A SINGLE SUBJECT HEARING TODAY. IT'S JUST TAX LAW BUILD MINUTES A- IT JUST MEANS THAT WHEN IT PASSES BOTH HOUSES. AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR GOES INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHICH IS THE ISSUE AT HAND SO THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH THE PRACTICAL.
