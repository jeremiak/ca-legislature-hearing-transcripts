AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS AND ESPECIALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUDY REVEAL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND REVIVING THIS SELECT COMMITTEE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IT IS A CRITICAL TIME TO START LOOKING AT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AT THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SYSTEM OF CARE. AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT AT THE NEED FOR PREVENTION AND YOU REALLY WE REALLY. FRAMED THE ISSUE AND VERY SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AS WELL. ASSEMBLY WOMAN. OF THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT FUELED BY THE WOMEN'S MARCHES ME TOO TIMES UP STAND UP AND THE INCREASING CONNECTION BETWEEN GUN VIOLENCE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHINES A LIGHT. ON THE ISSUE AND THE NEED FOR ITS PREVENTION. A AT A TIME WHEN SO MANY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE UNDER ATTACK. WE NEED TO CREATE NEW SOLUTIONS THAT PROMOTE SAFETY AND WELL BEING. THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY IS GARNERING YOU KNOW MULTI GENERATIONAL VOICES AND ADVOCATES. ACROSS THE NATION DOES THE ACROSS THE STATE THE NATION AND THE WORLD AND WE APPLAUD THIS COMMITTEE FOR HOLDING TODAY'S HEARING. AS THE LARGEST PRIVATE FUNDER OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION IS THRILLED ABOUT THE WORK THAT YOU WILL BE DOING IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS. THE MISSION OF THE OF THE BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION IS TO BUILD LASTING AN EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS TO MAKE CALIFORNIA THE HEALTHIEST STATE AND. TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. UP OVER THE PAST SIXTEEN YEARS THE FOUNDATION HAS MADE OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA SAFETY NET. FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WE HAVE INVESTED IN THE CRISIS RESPONSE SAFETY NET THROUGH CORE OPERATING SUPPORT SERVICE INNOVATIONS TO DEEPEN THE REACH IN THE QUALITY OF SERVICES. AND HAVE FUNDED FIELD CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING LEADERSHIP ORGANIZATIONAL STRENGTHENING AND NETWORK BUILDING. IN CARRYING OUT THE STRATEGY WE HAVE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM OUR WORK AND FROM OUR PARTNERS AND HAVE MANY SUCCESS STORIES TO SHARE AS WELL AS A FEW FAILURES. TODAY YOU WILL HEAR FROM THREE ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE ADVANCING INNOVATIONS FROM TO FOUNDATION INITIATIVES THAT WERE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FIELD AND TO INTEGRATE CARE ACROSS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. THE FOCUS AND LEADERSHIP OF THESE THREE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENT SEGMENTS. OF THE CURRENT AND FUTURE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR STATE. THEY FILL IMPORTANT GAPS IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SYSTEM OF CARE FOR VULNERABLE SURVIVORS AND ADDRESS GAPS ROOTED IN RESEARCH REGARDING NEEDS OF UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THEY AND OTHERS ARE SHARING THEIR PRACTICES AND PARTNERING ACROSS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FIELD. YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT HOW THEY ARE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITIES. HOW THEY ARE PROMOTING SURVIVOR AND COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP THEY'RE COORDINATING CARE ACROSS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS? AND ENGAGING FAITH BASED ON AND WHO WANT INFLUENTIAL COMMUNITY LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS CLERGY AND CHURCHES. WHICH IS  POWERFUL STEP TOWARD SHIFTING COMMUNITY NORMS AROUND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AS YOU KNOW THE IMPACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON OUR NATION AND STATE RUNS DEEP ONE IN THREE WOMEN WILL EXPERIENCE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IN THEIR LIFETIME. AND A SURVEY WE COMMISSIONED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHOWED THAT FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN EITHER TOUCH TO BUY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EITHER AS A VICTIM. AS AN ABUSER THEMSELVES OR THROUGH A CLOSE FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM AS YOU FRAMED EARLIER IT CAUGHT ITS ITS CAUSES OCCUR OVER THE SPAN OF YEARS OR DECADES. AND IT'S IT AND IT'S IMPACTS AFFECT MORE THAN TWO INDIVIDUALS IT EVERBERATES THROUGHOUT THE LIVES IN NOT JUST OF THE INDIVIDUAL SURVIVOR OR THE ABUSER BUT ALSO THEIR CHILDREN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS FOR SURVIVORS ARE WELL DOCUMENTED AND THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO CHILDREN WHO WITNESS PARENTAL VIOLENCE ARE AMONG THE RISK FACTORS THAT ARE FOUNDATION IS CONCERNED ABOUT. AS YOU WILL SEE AND ONE OF THE HANDOUTS THAT YOU HAVE THE COST TO THE HEALTH SYSTEM ESTIMATE IS ESTIMATED TO HE IN THE BILLIONS. AND WE KNOW THAT THIS DATA IS INCOMPLETE WE KNOW BECAUSE MANY VICTIMS DO NOT REPORT THEIR ABUSE. IT IS CLEAR THAT IN ADDITION TO MEETING THE MOST IMMEDIATE AND PRESSING NEEDS OF VULNERABLE RESIDENTS WE ALSO NEED TO CREATE NEW KINDS OF SOLUTIONS AND PREVENTION APPROACHES. OVER THE PAST YEAR THE FOUNDATION HAS BEEN EXPLORING HOW WE CANINVEST MORE STRATEGICALLY IN PREVENTING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS ITS OWN ROOT CAUSES AND COMMUNITY DETERMINANTS THE PIPELINE FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PERPETRATION AND VICTIMIZATION OFTEN STARTS WITH CHILDHOOD EXPOSURE TO ABUSE AND CONTINUES TO EARLY ADULTHOOD. WHILE THERE IS LESS ROBUST DATA ON HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PREVENTION PRACTICES AND PROGRAMS THERE'S ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN EXPERIMENTATION LEARNING AND SCALING PROMISING PREVENTION APPROACHES. WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT WHEN IT COMES TO IMPROVING THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. OUR STATE IS MADE UP OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND THOUSANDS OF COMMUNITIES. EACH WITH ITS UNIQUE SET OF ASSETS AND STRUGGLING WITH A UNIQUE SET OF CHALLENGES. AS THE FOUNDATION LOOKS FORWARD. WE LOOK TO PROMOTE UP BOTH HEALING AND PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE AT MULTIPLE POINTS ALONG THE INDIVIDUAL'S LIFESPAN. WE WILL DO THIS BY REDUCING EXPOSURE AND SUPPORTING YOU PREP PREVENTION PRACTICES FOR HELP UP FOR CHILDREN MOST AT RISK. UP PREVENTING RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE TO USE ENGAGEMENT MODELS ADOLESCENT RESILIENCY AND PEER TO PEER PROGRAMS. WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON COMMUNITY AND FAMILY BASED APPROACHES TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE PREVENTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT ALSO LEVERAGING GENDER SPECIFIC STRATEGIES. CROSS SECTOR COLLABORATIONS AND COALITIONS. WE ALSO WANT IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO GENERATE PUBLIC AWARENESS BOTH AT THE STATE AND COMMUNITY LEVEL AND YOU POLICIES THAT CAN HELP TRANSFORM GENDER VIOLENCE NORMS AND REDUCE PREVAILING STATEMENTS. AS YOU MENTIONED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS SO OFTEN INVISIBLE AND CONVERSATIONS. IN ITS ITS REALLY SHOCKING TO US TO SEE THAT YOU KNOW FEELS LIKE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS YOU HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS A DRIVER A LOT OF A LOT OF THE HOMELESSNESS AS AN EXAMPLE. THE FOUNDATION BELIEVES STRONGLY IN WORKING WITH SURVIVORS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY DEFINE SUCCESS. AND WE ARE SEEING THE POWER OF SURVIVOR SENATE INQUIRY AS DRIVING MUCH OF THE CHANGE THAT IS INFORMING OUR NEW DIRECTION TOWARD PREVENTION. WE ARE AT A TIME WHERE WERE WITNESSING THE POWER OF LIVED EXPERIENCE TO DRIVE CHANGE. INDIVIDUAL STORIES ARE DERIVING UNDERSTANDING CONNECTION AND AWARENESS AND YOU WILL HEAR COMPELLING STORIES TODAY FROM OUR OTHER SPEAKERS. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT A WINDOW HAS OPENED UP TO MAKE INROADS TO ADDRESS HARMFUL GENDER BASED NORMS THAT INFLUENCE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN TRULY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE OPPORTUNITY IS ESPECIALLY STRONG HEARING CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE VISIBLE STATE INDUSTRY AND MOVEMENT LEADERSHIP. THIS HEARING IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE QUALITY OF THE LEADERSHIP THAT WE HAVE. WE ARE IN A RENEWED MOMENT THAT DEMANDS INCLUSION AND EQUITY TO PREVENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND PROMOTE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO WORK LIVE AND PLAY. IN SAFETY AND. HEALTHY CONDITIONS MORE THAN THAT WE ALL DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FULL AND PRODUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AT THE FOUNDATION WE BELIEVE ITS POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND EVERY DAY WE COLLABORATE WITH FORWARD THINKING PARTNERS LIKE TODAY'S PRESENTERS AND OTHERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO SEEKING OUT THE BEST AND MOST INNOVATIVE. SOLUTIONS THAT ADVANCE EVERYONE'S WELL BEING. WE HOPE TO BE A RESOURCE TO THIS COMMITTEE AS YOU EMBARK ON THE IMPORTANT WORK. THAT YOU ARE EMBRACING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I I WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ARM. REGARDING. THIS OR ANYTHING THAT YOU MAY WANT TO. DISCUSS. OKAY WHAT THINK YOU ARM AND. I HAVE TO I THINK PART OF THAT THIS COULD BE MY OPENING COMMENTS WERE ABOUT HOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. ARE EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON. AND TRY TO ADDRESS THAT AND I PRIOR TO THE THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GIPSON IN THEM BRITAIN REFLECTING ON WHAT I'M LISTENING TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I AM. THE REFLECTION IS IN THE COMMENT THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON WERE OUT WERE MAKING AS I SAID. YOU KNOW WE TO HELP EVERYBODY BOB LINE AS. WE ALSO NEED TO HELP THE ABUSER. AND IMMEDIATELY I TENSED UP. I TENSED UP BECAUSE I SAID AND I'M YOU KNOW I'M AYE IF I'M GOING TO BE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT I HAVE TO SAY I SAID I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ABUSER. I SAID THAT BACKING OUT OF MY MOUTH. AND BECAUSE I HAVE SUCH. UP FEELINGS OF OF. I HATE IF YOU WELL I'D TOWARDS WHAT MY SISTER WENT THROUGH SO RIGHT AWAY I SAID I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ABUSER. AND I ASSEMBLY MEMBER GETS THEN HAD A FABULOUS RESPONSE IF YOU CAN BE SURE AND I AND I THIS IS ABSOLUTELY SAID THAT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE. A PERPETRATOR. ALSO GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED SO THEY CAN STOP WE HAVE TO BREAK WE HAVE TO BREAK THE CYCLE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE HURT PEOPLE HURT PEOPLE OTHER PEOPLE AND IT'S LIKE BULLIES SMALL BULLIES GROW UP TO BE BIG BULLIES AND THEY TAKE THAT BULLY MENTALITY INTO RELATIONSHIPS. AND IT BECOMES ABUSIVE AND SO I THINK IT'S SYSTEMIC I THINK WE NEED TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AS WELL. HOPEFULLY THEY CAN YOU KNOW GET THE KIND OF HELP THAT THEY NEED SO THEY CAN BREAK THE CYCLE OF ABUSE. BUT WE KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT BECAUSE THE U. LOOKING THERE'LL NEVER NAY LIFESTYLE THEY MAY HAVE ALSO BEEN ABUSE. AND SOME KIND OF WAY TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR SOMETHING ELSE. THANK YOU AND AND THAT'S. WHAT'S MY OWN REFLECTION IN THE LAST YOU KNOW FIFTEEN MINUTES BECAUSE I'M THE FIRST ONE LIKE I SAID I WAS LIKE I DON'T CARE. AND AND. I MEAN I ARE ALREADY IN FIFTEEN MINUTES I HAD AN AHA MOMENT AYE AS TO HOW I HAVE TO ALSO CHANGE MY MENTALITY IN MY APPROACH TO. THIS WHOLE. THE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC ABUSE BECAUSE AGAIN FOR ME OF THE PAPERS REACTION IS LIKE I DON'T CARE. YOU KNOW AND AND I CAN'T HAVE THAT. WAY WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING I ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE MY MENTALITY AND THE DEPTH ADDRESS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT REFLECTION BECAUSE I AM STRUGGLING WITH WHAT I JUST SAID. I AM REALLY STRUGGLING BUT IT'S ALSO AN EXAMPLE AS TO HOW SOCIETY AND AND OUR NEIGHBORS OR. ARE ARE STRUGGLING WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING SO THANK YOU AYE YES ABSOLUTELY. I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU. WE KNOW THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HURT EVERYONE NOT ONLY. THE INDIVIDUALS AND INVOLVED BUT ALSO IF THERE'S A HUSBAND. BUSE OF OF A WIFE WHO HAVE CHILDREN NORMAL. AND SO THEY ARE ALSO VICTIMS AS WELL SOAKING TALK ABOUT SERVICES THAT YOUR THE YOU KNOW THAT. YOUR ORGANIZATION PROVIDES TO THE ENTIRE FAMILY BECAUSE IT TIRE FAMILY HAS TO ALSO HEAL AS WELL. ME AS A FORMER POLICE OFFICER I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I HAD TO GO IN A SITUATION. WHERE I HAD TO ARREST? THE HUSBAND IN THIS CASE. FOR PUTTING HIS HANDS ON HIS WIFE. AND YOU HAVE KIDS CRYING. KIDS HOLLERING AND YOU KNOW I'M THE BAD GUY BECAUSE I'VE TAKE YOUR DAD TO JAIL. RIGHT AND THEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE OUGHT MOTHER THE SPOUSE OR THE PARTNER DON'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES BECAUSE LOVE IS INVOLVED. RIGHT AND YOU KNOW. AND I KNOW WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS WERE EVEN. EVEN THOUGH THE VICTIM DON'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES THE STATE CAN STILL PRESS CHARGES ON BEHALF OF SPECIAL WHEN THERE'S VISIBLE SIZE BUT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT. SERVICES IN WHICH YOU PROVIDE FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY WHO NEEDS TO HEAL WHO'S BEEN HURT BY THIS YEAH SITE I DO WANT TO SAY WE'RE NOT A PROVIDER WHERE A FUNDER. SO. THAT I I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE THAT THE TWO OF YOU ARE SPEAKING TO IS. THIS THIS. UP A VERY KIND OF THERE'S A VISION OF WHAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS AND WERE ALL LOCKED INTO IT YOU KNOW IT'S. A MAN HE NO WOMAN AND YEAH THEY'RE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT ARE AFFECTED AND WHAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO IS THE BROADER WORLD. AND. AND THERE AND AT THE REAL WORLD EXCUSE ME AND THE FACT THAT YOU DO HAVE. CHILDREN OF WHO ARE WITNESSING THIS VIOLENCE AND. WE ACTUALLY I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN LOCKSTEP WITH THE DOMESTIC. WE HAVE NOT CHALLENGE SOME OF THOSE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT. ABOUT THE NEED FOR CRISIS RESPONSE WE HAVE FUNDED IT FULLY WITH THE WITH THE INTENTION OF STRENGTHENING THE SAFETY NET AND. FUNDING INNOVATIONS BUT ONE OF THE EXCITING THINGS ABOUT THE FOLKS IN THIS ROOM IS THAT THEY CAN SPEAK MORE TO THE KINDS OF FAMILY BASED APPROACHES THAT ARE CULTURALLY SPECIFIC. ON THAT THEY ARE INNOVATING AND EXPERIMENTING AROUND TO DO MORE THAN JUST WORKED WITH THE SURVIVOR. I WILL SAY THAT YOU ARE RIGHT ON ASSEMBLY MEN GIPSON THAT. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE AS A RISK FACTOR FOR NACHOS VICTIMIZATION BUT PERPETRATION. I'M AND TO THE POINT OF THAT YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER ABOUT THE USER ABUSE THAT WE KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW ABUSERS ARE MEN AND WOMEN AND WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THE TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACHES TO BOTH PARTIES AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HOPING TO DO A LOT OF A TESTING AROUND WHAT PREVENTION APPROACHES COULD WORK. THANK YOU I'M DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ARE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM NOW PERHAPS SEND THEM TO US ON HOW OF. WAYS THAT THE SELECT COMMITTEE CAN. SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE FOUNDATION. YET THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN BE A RESOURCE AS WE MAKE THIS PIVOT TOWARD DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND AT THE SAME TIME REALLY TRYING TO. CONTINUE OUR EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND REALLY THINK DIFFERENTLY I THINK WERE IN A MOMENT. MANY MOMENTS OF. CHANGING MINDSETS AYE AND. LIKE IT LIKE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER LIKE I I WILL SAY THAT FOR MYSELF I WILL OUR FOUNDATION IT DIDN'T EVEN DIDN'T FIND ANY PROGRAMS FOR ABUSERS WE ACTUALLY STILL DON'T. BUT WE ARE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT. THE ROLE OF MEN AS ALLIES AND WE ARE FUNDING SOME EXPERIMENT SOME OF SOME REALLY GREAT WORK AROUND BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. AND IT'S SO WEIRD TO WE ARE ALSO EXPANDING OUR MINDSET AND WE ARE YOU WOULD LOVE TO BE A RESOURCE TO YOU AND SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU WHAT WE'RE LEARNING. AND TO THAT WOULD BE MY ASK OF YOU IS TO. IT'S TO BE. IT FOR US TO SHARE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN AND THAT HOPEFULLY WOULD BE OF OF ASSISTANCE TO YOUR WORK. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS. OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR THE INFORMATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO. HAVING MANY MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU AS TO WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO AND. HOW WE CAN PARTNER WITH YOU THANK YOU? KATE NEXT. I WOULD LIKE TO CALL UP CONNIE CHUNG JOB. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF KOREAN AMERICAN FAMILY SERVICES THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. I COME FROM A FAMILY WITH THREE GENERATIONS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MY MOM SHARES THE STORY OF BEING A TEENAGER AND COMING HOME FROM SCHOOL ONE DAY. AND SEEING HER MY GRANDFATHER YET AGAIN HITTING MY GRANDMOTHER. SO MY MOM WENT UP TO HER ROOM. AND SHE SLIT HER WRISTS. AND SHE WROTE A MESSAGE TO HER FATHER IN HER OWN BLOOD. AND IT SAID IF I EVER HAVE TO SEE YOU HIT MY MOM AGAIN. I WILL KILL MYSELF. I THINK HOW DESPERATE. MY MOTHER MUST HAVE FELT. THAT THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD PROTECT. MY GRANDMOTHER FROM ABUSE. AND PROTECT HERSELF FROM HAVING TO WITNESS IT. WAS OFFER HOME LIFE. SHE WAS A NORTH KOREAN REFUGEE. GROWING UP IN SOUTH KOREA. THAT HAD JUST BEEN UP RAVAGED BY CIVIL WAR. THERE WERE NO RESOURCES FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AT THAT TIME. AND I THINK ABOUT HOW HOPELESS MY GRANDMOTHER MUST'VE FELT IN HER SITUATION. AS A REFUGEE HER ENTIRE FAMILY WAS UP NORTH NEVER TO BE HEARD OF FROM AGAIN. EVEN IF THEY HAD BEEN NEARBY. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE SUPPORTED HER LEAVING HER HUSBAND ABANDONING HER WIFELY DUTIES AND BRINGING SHAME TO THE FAMILY. SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SURVIVE ON HER OWN INDEPENDENTLY. AS A WOMAN WITH ONLY SIX GRADE EDUCATION AND FIVE CHILDREN BY THE TIME SHE WAS THIRTY ONE. NOW FAST FORWARD OVER HALF A CENTURY LATER HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. WELL I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CREATE AMERICAN FAMILY SERVICES OR KAYFABE. WE ARE RESOURCE CENTER FOR CREAN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. WE SERVE SEVEN THOUSAND CLIENTS A YEAR. INCLUDING SOME TWO HUNDRED VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. RTV CLIENTS. ALMOST ALL WHO ARE MONOLINGUAL KOREAN IMMIGRANT WOMEN. FALL INTO THREE GROUPS. ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR CLIENTS ARE RECEIVING SERVICES FROM US. WHILE LIVING IN OTHER SHELTERS NEARBY WHERE THEY'RE RECEIVING LIFESAVING SUPPORT AS THEY REBUILT THEIR LIVES AND LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR CLIENTS ARE LIVING INDEPENDENTLY EITHER HAVING BYPASS THE SHELTERS OR HAVING GRADUATED. BUT THE LAST ONE THIRD ARE RECEIVING SERVICES FROM US. WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO LIVE WITH THEIR ABUSERS. FOR THESE QUICK CLIENTS. WHEN WE EDUCATE THEM ON THEIR OPTIONS FOR SHELTERS. THEY WEIGH THEIR OPTIONS AND THEY SAY. I COULD LEAVE MY HUSBAND. MY IN LAWS MY CHURCH BASICALLY EVERYONE I KNOW IN THIS COUNTRY. IN ORDER TO MOVE INTO A HOUSE. WHERE WILL BE COMPLETELY ISOLATED? BECAUSE THE OTHER RESIDENTS DON'T SPEAK MY LANGUAGE. THEY DON'T EAT MY FOOD. THEY DON'T KNOW MY CULTURE. EVEN IF I WERE TO ENTER SHELTER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I EVENTUALLY HAVE TO LEAVE. I DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. I'VE NEVER WORKED IN THE US I DON'T HAVE JOB SKILLS HERE. IN MANY CASES THERE UNDOCUMENTED. HOW WOULD I SURVIVE HOW WOULD I SUPPORT MY CHILDREN? FOR THIS SUBSET. OF ARE MOST VULNERABLE CLIENTS WHO CANNOT LEAVE. THEIR SITUATION FEELS TO ME. AS DESPERATE AS IT WAS. FOR MY NORTH KOREAN REFUGEE GRANDMOTHER. GROWING UP IN A WAR TORN COUNTRY IN SOUTH KOREA. DESPITE ALL THE RESOURCES WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE STATE'S APPROACH TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS BEEN A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. WHERE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES LIKE IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR OFTEN FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS? STATE HAS ONE ONGOING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GRANT PROGRAM CALLED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR DEVELOP. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN. DEVELOPERS AWARDED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE GENERAL FUNDS ANNUALLY TO THE SAME SET OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SHELTER PLUS THIRTEEN OTHER PRIESTS PRESCRIBED COURSE SERVICES. THERE HAD BEEN NO CHANGES TO ALLOW FOR NEW AGENCIES. OR NEW STRATEGIES THAT TARGET MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES OR FOCUSED ON PREVENTION OR INNOVATION. THIS IS WHERE THE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NETWORK COMES IN. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS C. R. D. V. EN. THIS IS A COLLABORATION FUNDED BY BLUE SHIELD FOUNDATION OF SIXTEEN ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES. WITH IN THEIR SPECIFIC COMMUNITY. SUCH AS AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER NATIVE AMERICAN AND DEATH IN DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING. OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS WERE DEVELOPED AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL. FROM WITH IN OUR SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT OUR DB SURVIVORS. WHO WERE NOT GETTING SERVED AS WELL IN TRADITIONAL MAINSTREAM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGENCIES? THE MAJORITY OF THE C. R. D. V. EN AGENCIES ARE NOT SHELTER BASED. THEREFORE WE DO NOT RECEIVE DEVELOP FUNDS. OKAY FAMILY WHICH HAS BEEN PROVIDING DB SERVICES TO KOREAN IMMIGRANTS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. IT MEANS WE HAVE DEVELOPED HOME GROWN STRATEGIES THAT WE'VE FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE WITHIN OUR KOREAN COMMUNITY. SUCH AS ENGAGING KOREAN MEN EMPLOYEES FOCUSING ON ARE SURVIVORS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND PARTNERING WITH KOREAN CHURCHES. LIKE MANY IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. FAITH BASED INSTITUTIONS ARE CRITICAL BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE COMMUNITY COMES TOGETHER NOT JUST FOR SPIRITUAL NEEDS. BUT TO SHARE INFORMATION AND TO FIND THEIR COMMUNITY. WE KNOW THAT SEVENTY TO EIGHTY PERCENT OF KOREAN IMMIGRANTS ATTENDED CHURCH REGULARLY. AND WHEN THERE'S A FAMILY CRISIS. OUR COMMUNITY OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WILL GO FIRST TO THEIR PAST WHETHER PASTOR'S WIFE'S. NOT TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EACH. SO SIX YEARS AGO. BLUE SHIELD FOUNDATION GENEROUSLY AWARDED US OUR FIRST GRANT TO EXPAND OUR WORK WITH KOREAN CHURCHES. SINCE THEN WE HAVE TRAINED MORE THAN A THOUSAND CREATE AMERICAN FAITH LEADERS. THROUGH FORTY OUR TRAININGS TWO DAY OVERNIGHT RID RETREATS ALL DAY CONFERENCES AND SHORTER PRESENTATIONS. WE HAVE AN ADVISORY COUNCIL MADE UP OF FAITH LEADERS WHO MEET MONTHLY TO GUIDE OUR WORK. CO FACILITATOR TRAININGS AND TO BECOME LEADERS WITHIN THE CHURCH. TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. NOW THEY'RE SEEKING MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WHEN WE HAD THAT WE HAD TO OVERCOME TO BUILD THESE PARTNERSHIPS. CREATE CHURCHES IN GENERAL HOLD CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN VALUES. AND FEEL THEIR ROLE IS TO PUT THE FAMILY FIRST. WHEREAS IN THE DB FEEL THIS ISN'T A PROGRESSIVE FEMINIST BASED MOVEMENT WELL WE PUT THE SURVIVOR AT THE CENTER. SO WE HAVE TO DISPEL A LOT OF THE DISTRESS. APPROACHING OUR FAITH LEADERS WITH HUMILITY. AND RESPECT FOR THE VITAL ROLE THEY PLAY WITH OUR CREE IN FAMILIES. THE RESULT IS THAT TRAINED CREAN FAITH LEADERS. BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THEY WERE REFERRING MORE VICTIMS TO LESS. AND THEY STARTED PREACHING FROM THE PULPIT ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND THEIR ATTITUDE BEGAN TO CHANGE. WHEREAS THE STARTED OFF BEFORE THE TRAINING BELIEVING THAT. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND MUST BE INSURED FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY. ONCE THEY GOT TRAINED THEY REALIZE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MUST STOP FOR THIS. WE'D LOVE TO SEE THE STATE FIND NEW CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE PREVENTION FOCUS PROJECTS LIKE THIS IN ALL KINDS OF COMMUNITY. WHICH IS WHY C. R. D. V. EN IS WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ASK FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BE PUT INTO THE STATE BUDGET TO FIND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION. AND A WIDE RANGE OF INNOVATIVE SERVICES TO REACH COMMUNITIES JUST LIKE OURS. IT'S TIME FOR THE STATE TO INVEST IN NEW AND EFFECTIVE PREVENTION INTERVENTION APPROACHES DEVELOPED WITHIN MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA IS NOW A MAJORITY MINORITY STATE. LATINOS ARE THE LARGEST RACIAL GROUP IN THE STATE AN ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE THE FASTEST GROWING. BOTH COMMUNITIES HAVE A LARGE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. THAT IS SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL BARRIERS. IT IS ONLY BY CHANGING THE WAY WE FIND AND PROVIDE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES. THAT WE WILL STOP YOU STORIES IN THISSTATE LIKE THE ONES FROM MY GRANDMOTHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HELP WITH THAT'LL OPEN IT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES. WELL THE ONE PAGE YOUR NARRATIVE THAT GREATLY INTERESTS ME ARM. IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WE DIDN'T HAVE A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION HEARING CALIFORNIA. AND PRETTY GROUNDBREAKING LEGISLATION WHICH THE SIGNED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO I THINK AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY THREE. COMMITTED TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT BILL OR THEY MEDIA FOLLOWING BILL TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION. AND THE APPROACH WAS ONE THAT KIND OF RINGS A BELL FOR ME AS YOU TALK ABOUT. WE'VE GOT A STANDARD APPROACH IN CERTAIN ENTITIES CAN IT THERE'S NOT MUCH BRANCHING OUT. BECAUSE THE APPROACH WHEN CALIFORNIA STARTED SYSTEMATICALLY MOVING AS CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION. AND THESE PROVISIONS NOW IS TWO FLIES AND OFFER INSTITUTIONS CODE. WAS TO LET IN EVERY COUNTY THE STATE. ORGANIZED GROUPS TO KIND OF PUT TOGETHER A PLAN FOR HOW THEY HAD A VISION OF SOME WAY TO RECTIFY. AN ASPECT OF CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION. AND LET IDEAS KIND OF BUBBLE UP FROM THE BOTTOM AND THEN COMPETE FOR FUNDING. AND IT. ALLOWED FOR ACTUALLY INNOVATION IN THESE PROGRAMS. THERE WERE TIED TO THE DISTINCT PERSPECTIVES OF COMMITTEES FROM EARTH WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND I THINK. I JUST FEEL THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY CONSTRUCTIVE. WAY TO GO ABOUT DOING IT. I THINK IN THIS AREA. I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY FOCUSING UPON YOUR GRANDMOTHER. BEAUSE I DO THINK A KEY PART OF THE CHEMISTRY HERE IS SORT OF THE. A CULTURAL ENVELOPE PEOPLE RAN. AND WHAT IS WHAT IS THE CUSTOM WAY THAT THEY RESPOND TO THINGS AND WHAT IS. WHAT HISTORICISM WHAT IS JUST? TO BE IN DIRT WHATEVER HE HAS. I THINK FINDING WAYS TO HELP PEOPLE. BE EMPOWERED AND GET OVER SORT OF WHAT THEY THINK IS. IS THE ONLY AVAILABLE PATH. A PATH THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH ARAGO THEY'RE MOST COMFORTABLE WITH SO DESPITE. WHAT'S BAD THEY DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO FIND A NEW PATH. I KNOW ABOUT THE BILL BECAUSE I WORKED ON IT. AND I. HAVE A PRESS RELEASE SAYING IN MY WALL FROM WHEN IT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. AND THE REASON WE DID THAT WE SIGNED INTO LAW WAS ACTUALLY BECAUSE. NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO WAS A YEAR OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. AND THE GOVERNOR WAS JERRY BROWN. AND HE SIGNED THE FUNDING. DESPITE THE PROSPECT OF A DOWNTURN. TO PUT RESOURCES WHERE THEY WOULD BE VERY MUCH NEEDED. SIGHS I CAN ASSURE THAT BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS WHERE THIS TYPE OF CONVERSATION SHOULD GO. HOW CAN WE? FIND THE RIGHT LEVEL OF RESOURCES PROVIDING THE STATE LEVEL. BUT NOT DICTATE THAT WELL LET'S. THREE PM ON THURSDAY IN SACRAMENTO SO THE PROGRAMS ARE RUNNING THIS WAY AND ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. TO FIND A WAY TO KIND OF PUT. PUT FINDING OUT WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE CLOSE TO THE. SCENE. I SEE THE PROBLEMS SHE THE MANIFESTATIONS THAT THEY NEED TO CONFRONT. CAN KIND OF INVASION NEW APPROACHES AND THEN STE SHARE SOME FUNDING STREAM. I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY AND ANYONE ELSE. I'M GOING TO. IT QUICKLY. THE PROGRAM THAT YOU CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN ITS IT FUND WHAT WHO THE THUNDER THROUGH. SO OUR WORK WITH FAITH BASED LEADERS IS CURRENTLY FUNDED THROUGH BLUE SHIELD FOUNDATION OKAY I DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAM WHICH HAS MULTIFACETED FUNDED. BY PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT FUND IT'S FOUND WHERE IN THE STATE IT'S IN KOREATOWN IN LOS ANGELES SO IT'S SICK REPEAT LOCATED IN LA WE ARE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING LA AND WE WORK WITH. SCREEN AMERICANS THROUGHOUT THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA WHICH INCLUDES THE FIVE COUNTIES. OKAY RIGHT. ONE OF THE I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND I GUESS WE'LL WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT IS THAT. THEIR* OUT. NOW THAT THEY'RE ALL EFFECTIVE THERE SO MANY DIFFERENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS FUNDED BY SO MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES. AND EVEN SOME OF. IN THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES HERE AND SOME DIFFERENT PLACES SO IT'S LIKE. IT'S IT'S SO BROAD IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAMS IN THE FUNDING IT'S HARD TO WRAP YOUR HAND AROUND WHAT THE STATE NEEDS TO DO BECAUSE OF SO MANY PIECES THAT ARE MOVING. AND. AND I KNOW THAT OUR. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES HAS SEVERAL DIFFERENT PIECES AS WELL SO IT BECOMES IT BECOMES A DIFFICULT ISSUE NOT THAT WE SHOULDN'T GRAPPLE WITH THE BUT OFTENTIMES IT COMES. RATHER QUICKLY AND. AND THE ABILITY TO BASICALLY COORDINATE IN SOME WAY BUILD LEVEL FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE COVERED EVERY AREA. YOU KNOW EVERY CITY HAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROGRAM AND. KNOW SAN DIEGO HAS SEVERAL ITSELF WOULDN'T IN TERMS OF SHELTERS AND I'VE BEEN ON SEVERAL BOARDS SO IT IT'S. AT THIS LEVEL IT'S KIND OF HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU DOING YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE TEN MILLION TWENTY MILLION FIFTY MILLION WHATEVER IT IS. IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO. AND WHETHER NOT WHERE IT'S GOING IS GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY BECAUSE OFTENTIMES SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS THE OIL. BUT IT MAY NOT BE THE MOST NECESSARY PLACE AND SO I THINK AT SOME POINT AND MAYBE THIS COMMITTEE WILL DEAL WITH THAT. THE. THE VARYING NEEDS AND HOW IT'S ACTUALLY COORDINATED NAM AND LOOKED AT NO WE'VE ASKED THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO LOOK AT IT. BECAUSE THIS A LOT OF STUFF BEING PUT IN THAT. OUR OFFICE THAT RELATES TO THIS AREA AND SO UP. I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS WHICH I YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE ARE LOT OF OTHER. ETHNIC GROUPS ARE ALSO GRAPPLING WITH THE THING BECAUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A UP. IS A VERY. OF BE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A SITUATION THAT IS IS NOT ONLY IMPACTED BY ALL THE OTHER THINGS BUT IT'S ALSO GREATLY IMPACTED BY CULTURE. AND WHAT WOULD GROUPS DO AND DON'T DO YOU KNOW AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT. I KNOW AGES AGO WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD WHEN THEY START DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN SAN DIEGO'S ON THE REGIONAL BOARD AT THE WHY AND FOR. AND IT WAS INTERESTING THAT EVEN THOUGH THE THE DIRECTOR WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN. THERE WERE NO AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE PROGRAM. NONE WELL WHERE IN THE CENTERS AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO THE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN BLACK COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE BLACK WOMEN GOT IT UNDER CONTROL AND NOBODY HITS THEM LIKE I GOT HIT BACK. A MINUTE WAS JILL THINKING SO IT DOES RESULT YOU KNOW HOPE THAT THERE WASN'T A LOT OF SERVICES THERE BUT THERE WAS ALSO A CONCERN THAT. A WHEN YOU CALL THE POLICE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY YOU YOU GET WORSE SITUATIONS REVENUE BETTER SITUATION SO IS A YOU MAY CALL OF THE MEN GET SHOT FOR DOING LITTLE OR NOTHING SO. AS A RESULT COMMUNITIES WERE NOT WILLING TO ALWAYS OPEN UP AND CALL POLICE OFFICER BECAME REALLY DIFFICULT OUGHT TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES IN A CULTURAL WAY SO. YOU KNOW SO IT WOULD BE INTERESTING. AS THOSE GROUPS DEVELOP YOU KNOW THAT THEY ISSUE OF CULTURE BECAME EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SHOULD BE BECAUSE LOOK AT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND AND SO MANY CULTURAL NORMS WHAT FAMILIES DO AND DON'T DO AND. AND HOW THE LARGER SOCIETY INTERACTS WITH THEM HAS. A PROFOUND IMPACT ON ON WHAT'S TAKING PLACE AND SO ON. A BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS A YOU KNOW A AND AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS BIG PICTURE LOOKS LIKE AND HOPEFULLY ACTS OF THIS COMMITTEE MIGHT BE ABLE TO. RAPIDS ARM AROUND AND GIVE SOME GUIDANCE I THINK A BIG CAPITAL AND SOME GUIDANCE TO OUR. OF FUNDING PROCESS AND WHAT HAVE YOU IN TERMS OF SO WE HAVE SOME SITES SUMS SUMS. CERTAINTY AND WHEN WE DEAL WITH IT THAT WE ARE REALLY APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND THAT WE'VE GOT ALL THE ISSUES COVERED. YEAH. YEAH MAY I RESPOND TO HIM. IT'S SO I CAN ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ASK FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT IS THAT IT HAS BEEN. REQUESTED THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF THAT FUNDING GO TO PREVENTION FORTY PERCENT UP TO MEET THIRTY PERCENT FOR. A NEW STRATEGIES AND TEN PERCENT FOR EVALUATION. AND WITH IN THAT STRUCTURE THERE'S ALSO BEEN AN EMPHASIS THAT NEW FUNDING NEEDS TO GO TO CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE SERVICE SAYS SO. I THINK THERE ARE SOME FRAMEWORK. BEING WORKED OUT WHERE SEE OUR DD AND FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE HAS TO GO IN EACH OF THOSE AREAS PREVENTION IN. INTERVENTION AND EVALUATION AND TO GO BACK TO YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLIES POINT WHEN YOU MENTION I THINK THE I THINK IT'S A VERY ASTUTE. OBSERVATION YOU MADE AND AND YOU'RE AND I THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION. AND YOU MENTIONED HOW COMMUNITIES DID IT FROM THE BOTTOM UP APPROACH AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A VERY. SCHOOL RIDE SYSTEM THAT SAYS FOURTEEN. ABOUT WE DON'T CALL IT BOTTOM UP WE CALL IT MARCHING TO CENTER BUT IT'S THE SAME IDEA LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MARGINALIZED WHAT HAD THEY DONE THAT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE. AND LET'S BRING THAT AND BRING THAT INTO THE MIX OF SERVICES AND PROGRAMS THAT WERE OFFERING IN THIS STATE BECAUSE. THE CURRENT MODEL IS. MEN IT'S HE'S NOT MAN BATTERERS ARE TAKING AWAY INCARCERATED AND SURVIVORS ARE USUALLY GOING INTO SHELTER AND OUR SYSTEM IS VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON THE CRISIS WE HAVE HOT LIKE WE HAVE SHELTER BUT. AND IT'S SHELTERS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WE'VE ALWAYS HAD NEED THEM AND THAT TWENTY A MILLION DOLLARS WAS FOR THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE MISSING IS WORSE THE PREVENTION RECEIPT EARLY INTERVENTION WHERE IS THE WORK THAT SAYS. SOME COMMUNITY SAY I DON'T WANT. TO SEPARATE AND SO WHAT CAN WE STILL DO TO ADDRESS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE FAMILIES DON'T WANNA BE SEPARATED. BECAUSE WHAT I'VE SEEN IN OUR COMMUNITY IS THAT BY THE TIME KOREAN CLIENTS ARE WILLING TO GO INTO A SHELTER. IT'S REACHED A CRISIS IT'S IT HAS REACHED A POINT WHERE USUALLY THE WOMEN ARE SAYING. MY GOD I'M GONNA DIE IF I DON'T LEAVE AN ESCAPE NOW AND WHY ARE WE NOT ADDRESSING IT IN AN EARLIER POINT BEFORE IT GETS THERE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. WELL I'M THE COMMENT THAT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IS IS INTO YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE. APPROACH ESPECIALLY NOW IN A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF THE LEAD THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY NOT A SILLY LOOKING. AYE UNFORTUNATELY THE MAJORITY ARE LATINO BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S OTHER IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEALING WITH THIS I'VE BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'RE LIKE. IF IF YOU GO IN REPORT I'M GOING CALL OUR IMMIGRATION ON YOU. AND AND. THAT'S A BIG ISSUE THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SITUATION THAT WE HAVE WITH THE WITH OUR PRESIDENT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ARE BEING TARGETED BUT MORE THAN THAT I THINK. THE ISSUE OF POVERTY EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT A PRETTY PARTICULAR CALLED IT IS A CULTURE WITHIN ITSELF THAT THE ISSUE OF POVERTY IS SO HUGE THAT A LOT OF THESE. FAMILIES LIKE YOU SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SEPARATED BUT MORE THAN THAT WHAT DO THEY DO BECAUSE THEY'RE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN A WORSE SITUATION THAT THEY ARE NOW AND SO CULTURAL YES YOU KNOW ETHNICALLY OF CULTURAL BUT I THINK POVERTY IS IT BECOMING A CULTURE. WHERE WHERE? WE'RE NEEDING THE HELP AND SO IF YOU CAN HELP US WITH THOSE CHARGES BUT I'M I'M STE I'M HAPPY THAT WE HAVE. HAVE YOU NOW BUT I'M SADDENED THAT THAT'S THE ONLY AT LEAST FOR NOW THE PROGRAM THAT WE KNOW OF BECAUSE. BAD APPROACH NEEDS TO BE IN EVERY COMMUNITY I KNOW YOU NOW THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ARE VERY FACEPLATE THINK FAITH BASED. THE LATINO COMMUNITY THERE YOU KNOW AND I SEE THOSE BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGES OF OF. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENTS BUT WE WE HAVE THE ABILITY THROUGH. CHURCHES TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT AND SELF VIEW COULD. NOT MY ASK OF YOU IS YOU KNOW SEND US THE MODEL THE PROGRAM AYE SO THAT WE DON'T REINVENT THE WHEEL AND WE HAVE ACCESS TO THAT. SO THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE BUDGET. REQUESTS THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING SOLID. AND SOME DATA AS TO HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS SO THAT THE NEXT YEAR AND HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR AND THINKING I WANT TO THANK DOCTOR WEBER FOR SUPPORTING OUR OUR OUR. OUR BECAUSE. BITE IN THE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE JUST THIS YEAR AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO KEEP LOOKING AT THIS AND A YEARLY BASIS AND IF WE CAN HAVE. THAT DATA AVAILABLE IT WOULD HELP US BRING THE DATA TO THE TABLE TO SEE HOW EFFECTIVE THAT FUNDING HAS BEEN AND SO. THAT WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT AN AND TODAY WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT CAN GOING TO ERADICATE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT IF WE KEEP INVESTING IN THIS. THEN THE HOPE IS THAT EVENTUALLY WE CAN BUT ONLY THROUGH DATA UNFORTUNATELY FOR US UP HERE WE ONLY SEE YOU. THE BIG PICTURE WE DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS THAT YOU DO TO THE GROUND YOU KNOW THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND IF YOU WILL. TO HELP US THROUGH THIS SOMETIMES WERE CAUGHT UP IN THIS YOU KNOW A FI LOW UP HERE ABOUT LOOKING AT IT AS A LINE ITEM AS OPPOSED TO. WHAT PROGRAMS WORK AND WHAT IS EFFECTIVE SO I LIVE THAT'S MY ASKED OF YOU AND IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANY MORE QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND? YOU KNOW IT'S VERY. DIFFERENT TO HERE PERSONAL TESTIMONY THAN IT IS TO READ ABOUT IT AND SO I THINK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO THAT. HELP US BE EDUCATED IN THIS ISSUE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I OF THE FORTY SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH YOU SOME GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'D NEXT I WANT TO CALL. KAREN EARL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF. JEALOUSY. IN ITS I DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HELP KILLER PARTNERSHIP IS A TOPIC THAT WILL BE DISCUSSING NEXT. I WANT TO SAY I AM VERY HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY AND FOR ME IT'S A FULL CIRCLE MOMENT. TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO IS A FOURTEENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT IN OTHER. AWESOME. MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS WE DISCUSS INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING THAT PREVENTING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR I SERVED AS CHIEF OF STAFF TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARGUERITE ARCHIE HUDSON ALSO A THE FOURTEENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. DURING THE TIME OF THE OJ SIMPSON TRIAL AND IF THERE WERE HASH TAGS DURING THAT PERIOD. FOR ME IT WOULD BE HASH TAG BEGINNING OF THE PRE WOKE MODE MOVEMENT. I SAY PRE WOKE BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE WANTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE INCLUDING WITH THE GROUND BREAKING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND SO MANY PEOPLE DID. MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT BECAUSE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND WOMEN OF COLOR WERE NOT AT THE STRATEGY TABLE AND PROMINENTLY HEARD. ISSUES IMPACTING MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES WERE NOT ADDRESSED AND TO THIS DAY WE CONTINUE TO PLAY CATCH UP. I REMEMBER THE STRUGGLE TO RECTIFY IN CHANGE THE FORMULA THAT WAS USED TO DISTRIBUTE NONCOMPETITIVE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GRANTS AND THE FIGHT WAGE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. ARCHIE HUDSON BARBARA LEE AND SPEAKER WILLIE BROWN WHO CAME TOGETHER TO TRY TO MAKE AN IMPACT. IT WAS TOO LITTLE TOO LATE. SOME SERVICE PROVIDERS RECEIVED NONCOMPETITIVE GRATZ OF HALF MILLION DOLLARS WILD FOR EXAMPLE GENOCIDE RECEIVED FIFTY THOUSAND. CLEARLY I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT TIME IN HISTORY AND I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGING ROAD IT HAS BEEN FOR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE TENNESSEE TO EFFECTIVELY SERVE WITH FEWER RESOURCES. CLIENTS WHO PRESENT WITH THE MOST COMPLEX SET OF ISSUES OF COURSE THESE ARE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS TO HAVE BUT NECESSARY AND ONE OF THE MANY REASONS I'M HAPPY TO STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS WORK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND TO SEE FULL CIRCLE MOMENTS THAT INCLUDE THE CURRENT CREATION OF COLD HEARTS. AND NETWORKS. AND COALITIONS THAT ARE GENUINELY INCLUSIVE. AND ENABLE ALL VOICES AND PERSPECTIVES TO BE HEARD AND THAT'S WHY PARTICULARLY PROUD TO BE PART OF THE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE DOMESTIC BALLOTS NETWORK. OUR STORY WHEN JESSE WAS FOUNDED SOME THIRTY EIGHT YEARS AGO BY FIVE WOMEN FROM THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WAS CONSIDERED TABOO. A PRIVATE MATTER TO BE RESOLVED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS GENESIS FOUNDERS. HELP CHANGE THAT BY PUTTING GENDER BASED VIOLENCE AND THE NEED FOR CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES FRONT AND CENTER IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH. STILL SALUTE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND HEALTH DISPARITIES. THE LEGACY OF GENESIS FOUNDERS IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT CONSISTENTLY STRIVES TO BE INCLUSIVE IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY AND LIFE EXPERIENCES. JESSE RECRUITS BOARD AND STAFF MEMBERS WHO ARE DEVOTED TO THIS BECAUSE IN WHO SHARED EXPERIENCES HELP FACILITATE TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS AND IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. TRUE TO GENESIS STANCE THAT MINUTE MAN MUST BE INVOLVED IN FINDING A SOLUTION TO GENOM BASE VIOLENCE GENESIS ENGAGES MAN ON ITS BOARD STAFF IN AS VOLUNTEERS. JESSE'S VOLUNTEERS AND YOU'VE PARTICIPATING A PREVENTION PROGRAMS GENERATION JAY AND OTHER YOUTH PROGRAMS WORK TO BRING DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES TO GENESIS APPROACH. TODAY GENESIS MULTICULTURAL STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS PROVIDE A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR AND INCLUDE EMERGENCY SHELTER TRANSITIONAL HOUSING DIRECT SERVICES AND OUTREACH AND PREVENTION STRATEGIES. JESSE IMPLEMENTS DOZENS OF CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES EACH YEAR IN USES COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION TO CHIRP TRANSFORM. PUBLIC PERCEPTION AS IT RELATES TO DOMESTIC INTERPERSONAL AND COMMUNITY VIOLENCE MANY OF GENESIS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES INCLUDING GENESIS AWARD WINNING LEGAL PROGRAMS WERE ESTABLISHED. AS AN ORGANIC RESPONSE TO OUR CLIENTS NEEDS. FOR EXAMPLE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE BEFORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ESCAPING. X. GAPING CYCLIC VIOLENCE AND ACCESS TO LEGAL ASSISTANT WAS FULLY UNDERSTOOD TENNESSEE HAS PROVIDED DIRECTLY LEGAL SERVICES AT NO CHARGE TO SURVIVING. SURVIVORS STRUGGLING THROUGH MYRIAD LEGAL ISSUES. AND JEALOUSY OUR CLIENTS REPRESENTS SOME OF THE MOST MARVELOUS MARGINALIZE SEGMENT OF SOCIETY WHO ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE JESSE BRINGS RESOURCE SYSTEM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THROUGH INNOVATION. AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS ALLOWING US TO MAXIMIZE RESOURCES. THIS VAST MAJORITY THE VAST MAJORITY IF NOT ALL OF GENESIS CLIENTS ARE FROM FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLES OF POVERTY. PREVENTED FROM REALIZING THE DIGNITIES AND LIBERTIES THAT THEY DESERVE BECAUSE OF THE ZIP CODES IN WHICH THEY WERE BORN AND THE SYSTEMIC INEQUITY IN TERMS OF EDUCATION. INCOME OPPORTUNITIES THAT A WRAP IT IN THOSE AREAS. CLEARLY WE NEEDED TO CREATE A PROGRAM THAT GOES BEYOND THE. USUAL HOTLINE IN TAKE SHELTER FOOD FEEL BETTER EXIT RETURNED TO PREVIOUS LIFE MORE VIOLENCE HOTLINE IN TAKE SHELTER FOOD. BILL BETTER EXIT AND REPEAT WE NEEDED TO PROVIDE. TIME AND SPACE FOR SURVIVORS TO HEAL. TOO INC TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL WE NEEDED TO LISTEN TO THE DATA. THE DATA IS AT THE CENTER OF OUR PROGRAM DESIGN WHEN WE SAY LISTEN TO THE DATA WE MEAN IT'S NECESSARY TO GO BEYOND COLLECTING NUMBERS BUT THERE IS ALSO A VERY REAL RESPONSIBILITY. TO UTILIZE THE INFORMATION TO ENSURE FAMILIES WHO INTO JEALOUSY CAN BECOME SUCCESSFUL. FOR EXAMPLE DATA FROM A RECENT. SURVEY NOTED THAT IN NINETEEN NOT THAT I'M SORRY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX WOMEN WHO ENTERED THE SHELTER SUFFER CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. EIGHTEEN HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED FORTY NINE WERE SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING FIFTY SIX WERE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HIS CHILDREN SIXTEEN WHERE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND THE LIST GOES ON. WITH WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN PRESENTING WITH THESE ISSUES IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO ONLY FOCUS ON SHELTER FOOD FEELING BETTER. ALTHOUGH VERY IMPORTANT THIS IS A START IF WE ARE TO TRULY CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THESE FAMILIES IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE ENGAGE IN SIGNIFICANT PARTNERSHIPS THAT GO BEYOND THE USUAL. IT'S ALSO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR TO ME SO WHEN WE MEET PARTNERS LIKE BLUE SHIELD FOUNDATION WHO UNDERSTAND THIS LAYER ISSUE WE BEGAN TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE BEAUTY IS THAT THE FOUNDATION GOES BEYOND JUST UNDERSTANDING BUT THEY ALSO SUPPORT AND HELP TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES BECAUSE THEY TOO ARE LISTENING TO THE DATA. BLUE SHIELD UNDERWROTE THE GENESIS CENTER WHAT'S HEALTH CARE PARTNERSHIP IN ACCORDING TO DOCTOR DAEDRA LONG OBGYN AT WHAT'S BEFORE THE PARTNERSHIP IN TWENTY FOURTEEN NINETY SIX WOMEN WERE SCREEN FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND BECAUSE OF THE PARTNERSHIP IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE PATIENTS WERE SCREEN AND WHAT'S HAD A PLACE TO REFER THEM GENESIS CENTER. THESE PROP PARTNERSHIPS PROVIDE ACCESS TO SERVICES MANY TIMES LIFE CHANGING SERVICES ONE OF OUR MIRACLES HAPPEN WHEN A FAMILY CAME INTO A SHELTER. BECAUSE A RIFF FROM A REFILL OUR REFERRAL FROM A SCHOOL WHERE WE WORK ON PREVENTION PROGRAMS. WHILE IN THE SHELTER AND THROUGH A HEALTH ASSESSMENT WE DISCOVERED THAT THE MOM HAD CANCER NO ONE IS THINKING ABOUT THEIR ACHES AND PAINS. AND THAT'S SOMETHING BIGGER MIGHT BE WRONG IT TOOK THE QUIET SPACE OF A SHELTER FOR THE MOM TO RECEIVE THE DIAGNOSES AND BECAUSE OF PARTNERSHIPS WE WERE ABLE TO COORDINATE CARE WITH WHAT'S HEALTH CARE. THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW DO WE MAKE THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS PART OF THE INSTITUTIONAL. INFRASTRUCTURE OF ORGANIZATIONS AND NOT EPISODIC OR PASSION PROJECT OF INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES MANAGEMENT OUR CURRENT LEADERSHIP. BLUESHIELD FOUNDATION IS BLAZING THE FOUNDATION IN THIS REGARD. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BLUESHIELD FOUNDATION FOR WORKING WITH GENESIS CENTER THE EAST LOS ANGELES WOMEN'S CENTER YWCA SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. AND COMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN SOUTH EAST LOS ANGELES TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THESE PROGRAMS THE POLICY AND PROCEDURE THEIR INVESTMENT IN THIS WORK ISN'T EBELING US TO PROMOTE THE IMPORTANCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND HEALTH CARE PARTNERSHIP. I'M HONORED THAT TENNESSEE HAS THREE PHYSICIANS ON OUR BOARD TOOL OF HOME ARE BUT DID UP PEDIATRICIANS BAKED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE IN A. FADED AND INTERSECTIONAL PARTNERSHIP. I QUOTE DOCTOR SYLVIA SWILLY JEALOUSY BORED ME MEMBER AND PEDIATRICIAN. TRAUMA PHYSICAL IN MOTION UNEMOTIONAL. INFLICTED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ADVERSELY AFFECT LONG TERM MEDICAL OUTCOMES DEPRESSION AND UP UP. BOB B. CITY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A MEDICAL PROBLEM THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE THREE OR MORE ADVERSE EXPERIENCE AND CERTAINLY OUR CLIENTS. WHO HAVE THREE A MORE? CHILD EXPERIENCE AND CERTAINLY OUR CLIENTS WERE CHILDREN MEET THIS CRITERIA ARE KNOWN TO HAVE NEGATIVE LONG TERM HEALTH OUTCOMES AS RELATES TO HEART DISEASE ASTHMA A BE CITY SUICIDE. AND THIS HAS BEEN REFERENCE IN MEDICAL JOURNALS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NEGATIVELY AFFECTS HEALTHCARE. COSTS. IN A QUOTE. ROBUST MEANINGFUL PARTNERSHIPS LIKE THE ONE WE SHARE WITH BLUE CHAU FOUNDATION ENABLES US TO GO BEYOND RHETORIC AND FEEL GOOD PHILANTHROPY TO MAKE REAL LASTING CHANGE IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO DREAM OF A WORLD IN WHICH GENDER BASED VIOLENCE IS A THING OF THE PAST. YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL BRING UP TO THE COMMITTEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISSOURI I'M CERTAINLY. APPRECIATE IN GENESIS HAS BEEN OVER A LONG STANDING ORGANIZATION THE COMMUNITY. I REMEMBER WHAT I WAS THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ACTS WERE FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND HOW. PLEASED TO FIND YOU ORGANIZATION TERMS OF THE WORK THAT YOU DO IN THE COMMUNITY. I'M CERTAINLY AT MY TAKE AWAY AS THE PARTNERSHIP IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND TRYING TO PROVIDE A LINKAGE. IN THE COMMUNITY SPECIAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT EXISTS. AND SO. AS WELL LET YOU KNOW THAT CERTAINLY WE STAND READY WILLING ABLE TO DO WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO LIFT AND WE NEED. TO DO TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT COME TO FOR RATIONS. BECAUSE AGAIN I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THE MEDIA'S TAYLOE STORY ABOUT MY MOM AND MY SISTER WAS. DATING THIS IS GENTLEMAN. SEE RATHER THUNDER THINKS IS A BLACK WOMAN FROM THE SOUTH. SO SHE TOLD BUSES BOYFRIEND PLEASE COME INTO A ROOM TO SIT ON HER BED WITH THEIR AND SHE TOOK MY SISTERS ARE YOU SEE THAT FACE. TURNED BOTH SIDES HERE ARMS THAT'STHE WAY I WANT TO COME HOME EVERY TIME YEAH. IF NOT OPEN A CLOSET UP RIGHT THERE. AND SO SHE SAID LOVE XIN NEVER HURT. LOVE SHOULDN'T HURT. AS IF TO GIVE TO GET TO A POINT WALK AWAY. WALK AWAY THAT'S THE BEST THING FOR YOU GO COUNTERTENOR GO OUT FOR A WALK AROUND THE CORNER THE LOVE SCENE NEVER HURT. AND SO THAT WAS CERTAINLY A TAKE AWAY FROM ME AND I KNOW THE WORK THAT YOU GUYS DO I'M IN YOUR KIT. AT THE GENESIS CENTER. TRAINING OUR YOUNG MALES SO THEY CAN GROW UP TO UNDERSTAND THE LOVE SHOULDN'T HURT. AND I BELIEVE AGAIN TRAIN UP A CHILD IN THE WAY HERE SEIZE AGO WHEN A GHETTO THEY WILL NOT DEPART. AND ALSO IN THE AFRICA IN A POVERTY IT TAKES ENTIRE VILLAGE WHO WE HAVE TO AS LAWMAKERS PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR THE VILLAGE YEAH WE CANNOT EXPECT SPEC THE VILLAGE OPERATE. AND TO RAISE A CHILD IF THERE'S NO RESOURCES THERE. AND SO WE HAVE TO BE A STRONG ADVOCATE AND CERTAINLY. YOU KNOWS MY DESIRES TO PRESS ONE EVERYONE THIS ROOM TO BE A STRONG ADVOCATE TO ADVOCATE FOR THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT YOUR PRESENCE. IS MAY KNOWN APPEARED SACRAMENTO'S LAWMAKERS. SO GET OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY AND ALSO A IN THIS SPACE AROUND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE A THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU I'M JUST JUST ANOTHER COMMENT. AND I'M SEEING IT WE HAVE DIFFERENT A LOT OF DIFFERENT A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT THAT I DO THIS WORK AND HE AND I DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE I AM IGNORANT. BUT THERE'S SO MANY THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT AND I THINK THAT'S. HOPEFULLY THIS IS WHAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE TAKE AWAYS IS HOW MANY. ORGANIZATIONS AND DO WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF HOW MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITIES SO THAT OUR OFFICES NOT JUST APPEAR BUT THE OFFICES IN THE COULD I. IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICES HANDLES RESOURCES AVAILABLE I KNOW. MY STAFF IS WELL BETTER PREPARED THAN I AM. BUT I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE KOREAN. ORGANIZATION I DIDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW ABOUT YOU. AND SO I WANT AT THIS TO ALSO BE WHERE WE COMPILE THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DOING THIS WORK SO THAT WE CAN NOT ONLY REACH OUT TO YOU BUT WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE. ARE ABLE TO REFER THEM TO. ORGANIZATIONS LIKE YOU SO THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER ELOISE GOMEZ REYES. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THANK YOU FOR FOR THE INFORMATION YOU IT'S IT IS SO IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF OF MY COLLEAGUES. I KNOW THAT IN SAN BERNADINE ON OUR AREA WE MADE IT A POINT TO IT JUST AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO HAS DONE. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STAFF KNOWS WOULDN'T WE RECEIVE A CALL WE NEED TO KNOW WHO TO REFER PEOPLE TO. I APPRECIATE THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LEGAL SERVICES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A STAR CYCLE. YOU KNEW WHERE TO PUT EACH PERSON TO PROVIDE THAT ASSISTANCE BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALSO PROVIDED THAT LEGAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT THEY COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS AN OPTION. WE WE WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE THE PLACES IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE FOUNDATION. FOR THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED. MANY OF THOSE WERE FORMALLY INCARCERATED ALSO WORTH VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND SO THIS THIS INTERGENERATIONAL. ASPECT THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IF SOMETHING WE DO HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO TO TO. STOP IT TO CUT IT. ONE OF THINGS THAT THAT FOR ME HAS BEEN SO IMPORTANT IS THAT WHEN WE START PUTTING TOGETHER THE BUDGET THAT WE COME UP WITH THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND IT GOES TO AN ORGANIZATION OFTENTIMES THE ORGANIZATION STATE OF. FUNNELING IT TO THE VERY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DOING THE WORK IN THE COMMUNITY THEY START BRINGING PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY TO COME IN AND STUDY THE ISSUE. WE DON'T NEED STUDIES WE HAVE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE YOURS LIKE YOURS. THAT ARE ALREADY DOING THE WORK AND THE WEEK WE DON'T WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL WE LOOK TO THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS. AND YOURS OF THE PROGRAM'S. THAT THAT THAT WE NEED TO THEM FIVE WE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING FINDS ITS WAY TO YOU. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SERVE ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE WITH YOUR FUNDING KNOW IF WE'RE ABLE TO INCREASE THE FUNDING WE DON'T TO START ANOTHER ORGANIZATION WE TO FUND THE ORGANIZATION SO INSTEAD OF ONE HUNDRED. WE GET TO TO TWO HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND. THAT SHOULD BE WHAT WE NEED TO DO. BUT I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU A PART OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED HERE TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MY PLEASURE.

THAT YOU PROVIDE FOR MEN WHO ARE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE YOU CAN SPEAK TO. PROBABLY THREE YEARS AGO WE STARTED EIGHT MEN PROGRAMS THAT WHAT'S CALL ON. AND THEIR OWN BUDGETS AMONG MEN. AND I WASN'T ACTUALLY WITH A ONE YEAR PROGRAM. AND TO BE HONEST JUST TO GAIN THE TRUSTS FROM OUR COMMUNITIES AND PARTICULARLY MAN AND IS WELL KNOWN DEMANDS ARE WE HAVING CHALLENGESOR PROVIDE SERVICE PROVIDERS INCLUDING HEALTH. CARE AGENCIES ARE HAVING A LOT OF CHALLENGES TO GET MEN. TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH. AND GO THAT BASIC TESTS WAS VERY KIND OF SIMILAR. TO WHAT OUR EXPERIENCE WANTS. SO WOULD YOU AGREE THAT A GROUP OF OUR TEN MEN. AND WE TRAIN THEM AS SPECIFICALLY AROUND OUR LEADERSHIP. DEVELOPMENT TRAINING. BUT ALSO WERE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT BY LINDS ON. IN THE FAMILY. AND ALSO HEALTHY COMMUNICATION WITH OUR AND AND RELATIONSHIP. AND THAT'S THAT WE WERE BUILDING THAT PROGRAM UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THAT WORK DEPENDS ON FINDINGS. SO. THAT WHAT'S THAT AS THE BEAK I I WITH A BIG CHALLENGE TO KEEP THAT PROGRAM GOING. SO WE TRIED OUR BEST TO KEEP THE PROGRAM BUT BECAUSE I FIND THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO KEEP THAT PART TIME. AND COORDINATOR AT OUR ORGANIZATION AT THAT TIME. HOWEVER THE RECENT. THROUGH THE IT'S ON CURRICULUM THAT GIVE WE DEVELOP THEIR SCHOOL LEAVING WE LOFT OR EVEN THE ONE I'M MORE. THERE'S TWO PART OF IT THERE IS TO WIND THAT WE ARE DOING THIS RESEARCH STUDY TOOK FOR THAT CURRICULUM THROUGH A GRANT. FROM THE STATE. BUT ALSO WE HAVE AYE AYE CONTRACT WITH A LOCAL BEEKEEPER HEALTH ON. DEPARTAMENTO HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND IT'S A SMALL BUT BROWN IS A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS GRAND FOR ONE YEAR. AND WE ONLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE ONE PERSON THE TEN HOURS PER WEEK. TO PROVIDE THAT ONLY CLASS IN THAT CLASS IT'S WE STARTED THE CLASS WITHOUT A WOMEN ONLY CLASS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE WOMEN'S HISTORY HAVING THAT DEMANDS OF. THEM BEING MORE INTERESTED TO BRING THEIR PARTNERS WITH THEM. SO WE STARTED OPEN THAT. PROGRAM TO BE. WIFE AND HUSBAND. I CLASSES TO GET FOR THAT ONLY. CLASSES LEAVING WOULD LOVE. I THINK SOMEONE MENTIONED IT EARLIER. THAT THERE'S A LOT OF. KIND OF CULTURAL BELIEFS THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE NOT ONLY THE LATINO BY THE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ON THE DECISION THE PEOPLE BY CALLING THE POLICE HAVE THERE'S A VIOLENCE. SO DO THE LESS THAT OUR PEOPLE WERE MAINLY WOMEN ARE VICTIMS THAT THEY WANT TO DO IS TO CALL THE POLICE BECAUSE HE THE CALL THAT BELIEF IN THE PUT UP POLICE ON THERE HAS BEEN. THEY KNOW THAT THAT PERSON WILL BE DEPORTED. AND THAT WILL BE A FAMILY SEPARATION. SO THERE IS SOME WOMEN'S THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO COME A PHONE AND SAY I'M HAVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT'S THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING MORE LIKE WHAT IS. WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES IS THERE SO I CAN INCLUDE MY HOUSE WHEN IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW CAN WE IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP? AND I THINK SOME OF THEM THE STARTED SEEING LEVON WOULD LAUGH CLASS THIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT. OF IN THIS SPACE. FOR THAT. THINK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WELL THANK YOU. VERY MUCH AND I AT THIS POINT I WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO THE PUBLIC IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR. ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD TO THIS CONVERSATION WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO A GAME THIS BEING THE FIRST OF MANY. WE HEARINGS THAT WE CAN HOPEFULLY. HAVE SOME OUTCOMES TO ALRIGHT. ERICA GOOD AFTERNOON. IF YOU SO MUCH FOR. THE. TODAY INTO I ABOUT OF WHAT I KNOW IS. BUSY BUSY WEEK CARE HOSPITAL. BY ON BEHALF OF THE APPROPRIATE PART. THE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION THAT. DISTINCT PLEASURE BUDGET WORKING WHEN. EVERYONE THAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY AND OUR COLLEAGUE CALLED. STATE. NO I. SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ISRAEL IN ONE I THINK YOU ALL FOR MAKING THE TIME. CHEN. FORWARD TO WORKING WITH. THROUGHOUT THE. THANK YOU. OKAY HI. WHO Z. AND I'M? TING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT ASIAN WOMEN SHELTER IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I JUST WANTED TO. SHARE A COUPLE OF MOMENTS WITH YOU FROM MY WORK AT A W. S. I'VE BEEN THERE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE. AND. I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT ASIAN WOMAN SHELTER AS A CULTURALLY GROUNDED SHELTER PROGRAM. THAT DOES FULL. CASE MANAGEMENT FULL SUPPORT THAT'S IN A RESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY CITING AS WELL AS IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING CITING AS WELL AS JUST COMMUNITY BASED NON RESIDENTIAL SERVICES. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REALLY INTEGRATE. PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION SERVICES TOGETHER IN OVER FORTY TWO LANGUAGES SINCE WE OPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. AND THE THING THAT I ONE THING THAT I WANNA RESPECTFULLY DO WITH THE WITH THE COMMITTEE IS. IS SHARE A PERSPECTIVE. HOME FROM ME THAT REALLY STARTS WITH MY FAMILY EXPERIENCE I DON'T ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT MY FAMILY VERY MUCH BUT CONNIE INSPIRED ME. SO I'M A SO MY MY GRANDMOTHER. MY GRANDMOTHER WAS. IN HONJO IN CHINA SHE WAS BORN AND RAISED THERE AND I LEARNED LATER AFTER SHE HAD COME TO BERKELEY AS A SENIOR CITIZEN. THAT IN HER YOUNGER YEARS SHE WAS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER OF HER TOWN. AND SHE WOULD BRING IN WOMEN KNEW THAT THAT WAS THE HOUSE THAT THEY COULD GO TO. AND THAT MY LITTLE FOUR FOOT ELEVEN GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS REALLY QUITE DOMINEERING AND POWERFUL. IN BOTH GREAT WAYS AND OCCASIONALLY CHALLENGING ONES WAS JUST AS STRONG AND BOLD. THEN AS SHE WAS LATER IN HER EIGHTIES AND NINETIES AND SHE WOULD WELCOME WOMEN INTO HER HOUSE. AND SHE WOULD SUPPORT THEM AND ONE OF HER TAGLINES WAS YOU KNOW. YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY THE WORLD SAYS HUSBANDS ARE EVERYTHING BUT FRIENDS ARE BETTER. AND THEY COULD STAY AT HER HOUSE AND STAY WITH HER UNTIL. USUALLY THEY FELT LIKE THEY COULD GO BACK. TO A SLIGHTLY DE ESCALATED SITUATION. LATER MY MOM THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE A BETTER SITUATION BECAUSE EVEN MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FROM MY GRANDFATHER EVEN WITH ALL OF THAT. POWER THAT SHE HAD. AND. AND I WANNA SHARE THAT IN MY EXPERIENCE WITHIN MY FAMILY AND AND SOME OF OUR WORK AT ASIAN WOMEN'S SHELTER. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE THAT HURT PEOPLE HURT PEOPLE. AND. HURT PEOPLE DON'T HURT PEOPLE. AND. AND THE IN MY FAMILY AND IN MANY OF THE FAMILIES AT A W. S. THAT HAVE COME TO A W. ASK WHAT WE SEE IS DEEP DEEP ROOTS OF PATRIARCHAL ENTITLEMENT. AND ARE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE PROGRAMS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE BEST SITUATED TO DISMANTLE THAT PATRIARCHAL ENTITLEMENT. AND THAT PATRIARCHAL ENTITLEMENT IT MIGHT NOT BE ENTITLEMENT OVER YOUR WORKPLACE IT MIGHT NOT BE ENTITLEMENT OVER YOUR ENTIRE LIFE HERE IN THE U. S. AS A MARGINALIZED PERSON. OR MARGINALIZED MAN BUT IT IS PATRIARCHAL ENTITLEMENT SPECIFICALLY OVER YOUR FEMALE PARTNER AND YOUR CHILDREN. AND THOUGHT WE'D BECAUSE WE'RE WITH FAMILIES ALL THE TIME THROUGH THE CHILDREN'S PROGRAM WE HAVE TRANSFORMED. SIBLING UNITS. WHERE A SON HAS BEEN TOLD SINCE BIRTH THAT HE IS PURE PERFECTION JUST FOR EXISTING? EVERY MOVE THAT HE MAKES. IS TREASURED. AND HIS SISTER MIGHT GET A COMPLIMENT IF SHE HELPS HIM HARD ENOUGH. AND OTHERWISE SHE'S JUST. THAT NOTHING. AND WE THAT THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ROOTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT HAPPENED ALL BY THEMSELVES WITHIN THE FAMILY SETTING AND IN THE LARGER CULTURAL SETTING WHERE MAYBE BOTH OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING THE EFFECTS. OF SYSTEMIC RACISM THEY BOTH SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF IMMIGRATION OF NOT BEING ABLE LATER TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR PARENTS IN THE SAME LANGUAGE LA LA LA. THAT ENTITLEMENT STARTS YOUNG AND WHEN WE CAN BE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE ORGANIZATIONS FUNDED TO DO PREVENTION WORK AS PART OF OUR INTERVENTION WORK THEY ARE INTERCONNECTED. WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE. THOSE DYNAMICS AS THEIR LIVED IN THE DATED A WITHIN A FAMILY AND WE KNOW THAT JUST AS WITH UNHEALTHY. IS INTERGENERATIONAL AND COMPOUNDS OVER TIME WHAT'S HEALTHY DOES TO. AND WHEN YOU CHANGE THAT IN THE SHELTER YOU CHANGE THE AND A FAMILY EARN A CONGREGATION THAT'S GOING TO GO GENERATION AFTER GENERATION AND NOTS WHAT I REALLY WANT TO IMPRESS UPON YOU IS PART OF THIS. ASK FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE ENDING OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN WAYS THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT IN THE QUICKEST WAY. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO. MY NAME IS RACHEL I AM CHARCOAL APACHE IN THE HAN AUTUMN. AND MEXICAN ON MY FATHER'S SIDE. AND MY ASK IS THAT I LOVE THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING. I WORK AS AN ADVOCATE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND WHAT I HAVE NOT HEARD AND WHAT I'M FINDING IS THAT ARE INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN OUR NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION IS NOT ON YOUR MAP. AND. ICE IT HAD RECEIVED A MESSAGE THIS MORNING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE MISSING IN CALIFORNIA. DEPARTMENT THE WOMAN WHO WORKS IN NOT. DEPARTMENT OR PROGRAM BY REQUESTED A NUMBER FOR THE MISSING NATIVE WOMEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND SHE LET ME KNOW THAT THEY DID THERE IS NOT A CODE. FOR US. I GREW UP AS A MEXICAN AMERICAN BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SAFE FOR US TO BE INDIAN. AND SO WE ARE IN THIS URBAN COMMUNITY WHERE A LOT OF NATIVES ARE AND A LOT OF US HIDE UNDER. OUR OTHER MIXED RACE WHICH WOULD BE NATIVE OR AFRICAN AMERICAN IT EASIER FOR US TO COME OUT THAT WAY. AS FAR AS MY FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE CONSERVED TRYING TO DO AND MAKE. BE VISIBLE FOR MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN WERE GETTING A LOT OF. ROAD BLOCKS IN BARRIERS BECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE NOT REPORTED BECAUSE WE'RE STILL VERY MUCH AN INDIGENT. INVISIBLE POPULATION. I RECENTLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THAT WORKS WITH THE SEX TRAFFICKING UNIT THEY ALSO. AREN'T AWARE OF THE URBAN POPULAR BEEN INDIAN POPULATION HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IS KIND OF FUNNY BECAUSE HE SAYS WE DON'T THINK YOU KNOW WE THINK INDIANS LOOK LIKE THEY DO ON THE RESERVATION AND HE WAS ABLE TO NAME SOME OF THE RESERVATIONS THAT WERE OUTSIDE. BUT IT WAS A VERY. I OPENING FOR HIM AND FOR THEM TO NOT NOTICE THAT. I LOOK I EIGHT JUST LIKE AN INDIAN YOU KNOW AND SO. WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE AND WHO I IS I I NEED A CONTACT OF HOW IT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND PEOPLE LIKE ME? WHO IDENTIFY SOMETIMES IS MEXICAN BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER SOMETIMES IT'S SAFER FOR US? AND SO. WITH THAT I FEEL LIKE THAT CONVERSATION CAN BE PRETTY EFFECTIVE AND CULTURALLY ARM WE DON'T. WE ARE FAITH WE ARE NOT FAITH BASED IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE AND SO THE WAY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HEAL. IS THROUGH ARE CEREMONIES AND A LOT OF THOSE CEREMONIES ARE COMMUNICATED BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT SAFE TO DO SO. SO. MY ASK WOULD BE. WHO I ASK? OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU. SOAK CRYSTALS TAKING NOTES AND AND THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS HOT THE BEGINNING OF THIS THIS HEARING IS TO. TO IDENTIFY THE. OBVIOUSLY THE ISSUES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT WHAT. GROUPS ARE NOT BEING REPRESENTED AND BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT. THERE'S SO MANY OF CULTURES THAT ARE NOT BEING REPRESENTED OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE NOT BEING. REPRESENTED EITHER OF THEIR IS VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS IN THE RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE URBAN COMMUNITY SO THANK YOU FOR ASKING AND CRYSTAL IF YOU LEAVE YOUR INFORMATION WE CAN GET. SHE CAN GIVE YOU YOUR HER INFORMATION WE CAN WORK WITH YOU ON ON I'LL HOPE. HOPEFULLY IDENTIFYING AND I ADDING BAD. BACK TO AYE DESIGNATION TO TO THE TRACKING SYSTEM SO THANK YOU AGAIN.

AND I'M HERE TO STAND ARM WITH SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT ALSO JUST TO BRING TO THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION ON THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ISSUES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. I THINK. WE REALLY APPRECIATE HOW THE STATE HAS BUILT A STRONG INFRASTRUCTURE IN STRONG SAFETY NET FOR INTERVENING IN IMMEDIATE MOMENTS OF CRISIS BUT WE ALSO WANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE AND REAFFIRM THE FOLKS WHO HAVE WHO HAVE SPOKEN OUT ABOUT HOW OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE NOT SEEN OR NOT REACHING EVERYBODY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON ONE A SURVIVOR STEPS INTO INTO A RAPE CRISIS CENTER WENT TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER THEY'RE CARRYING WITH THE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF PAIN IN MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF VIOLENCE. ON OUR STATE NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE FACT THAT SURVIVORS ARE EXPERIENCING MANY DIFFERENT FORMS I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION AND SAY THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST OF PREVENTION EDUCATION. SPEAKS TO THE NECESSITY THAT MAN BE EQUIPPED WITH THE CAPACITY TO KNOW BETTER TO DO BETTER AND TO BE BETTER AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL START WORKING TOWARD SOLVING. THESE PROBLEMS TOWARD SOLVING THESE MULTIPLE FORMS OF VIOLENCE THAT INFLICTED ON PEOPLE ON THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO COMMIT RESOURCES NEEDS TO COMMIT ATTENTION I NEED TO GET THOSE RESOURCES TO POCKETS OF THAT'S PART OF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY REACHING AND SO WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES DEDICATION TO THIS AND WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO ON ESPECIALLY FOR CHAMPING A BUDGET REQUEST THAT WE GET THOSE TYPES OF RESOURCES TO PLACES WHERE THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY GOING. BUT ALSO TO START ADDRESSING THESE FORMS OF VIOLENCE IS CONNECTED AND THAT IMPACT PEOPLE IN MULTIPLE WAYS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE.

IF WE CONTINUE TO THROW THEM AWAY. THEN HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO REALLY BREAK THE CYCLE. AND SO WE STARTED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT AND. AND BECAUSE WE GOT THE FLEXIBILITY IN OUR PROGRAMMING. WE START TO DEVELOP CULTURAL SPECIFIC PROGRAMMING FUHRMAN. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT BE WITH THE RATTLES. AND BECAUSE THE COURT THE COURT BATTLES ARE. OUR SACRED STUFF YOU'RE TOUCHING A SACRED OBJECT WITH YOUR HAND. THEN YOUR HAND ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HURTING ANYBODY ELSE. ARE YOURSELF. AND SO I'M. SO THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT. PUTTING MORE RESOURCES INTO CULTURAL SPECIFIC PROGRAMS WHETHER THEY'RE IN. INDIAN COUNTRY. THE KOREAN COMMUNITY LATIN NEXT COMMUNITY. THE DEATH OF. THE DEAF COMMUNITY. AND BECAUSE.
