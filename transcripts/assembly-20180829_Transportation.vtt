REJECT THIS BILL ONE OF THE

00:22:34.887 --> 00:22:39.058 region:rollup2

00:22:53.239 --> 00:22:55.875 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS --

00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:57.276 region:rollup2
ONEROUS REGULATION THAT IT'S

00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:59.645 region:rollup2
ALSO BAD FOR THE BUSINESSES THAT

00:22:57.276 --> 00:23:00.179 region:rollup2
HIRE THE VERY PEOPLE THAT THIS

00:22:59.645 --> 00:23:00.479 region:rollup2

THIS BILL DOES NOTHING FOR THEM

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:20.432 region:rollup2
AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:21.734 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES RIGHT ON THE VERGE OF

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:23.002 region:rollup2

AND I REALLY ENCOURAGE THE THE

00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:29.975 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO COME BACK IN THIS

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:31.076 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE TO COME BACK AND WORK

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:33.345 region:rollup2
ON MEANINGFUL LEGISLATION THAT

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:34.647 region:rollup2
BENEFITS ALL CALIFORNIANS AND

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:36.348 region:rollup2
TREATS THEM EQUALLY.

00:23:34.647 --> 00:23:38.417 region:rollup2
ARE BECAUSE THE VERY ENGINEERS

APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS NOTICE

00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:06.585 region:rollup2
OWNERS BUT THE APPRENTICESHIP

00:28:05.217 --> 00:28:09.154 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE REALLY UNIQUE IN

00:28:06.585 --> 00:28:10.722 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE A VERY DIVERSE.

00:28:09.154 --> 00:28:11.657 region:rollup2
FLEET THAT HAVE TO TO MAINTAIN

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:13.158 region:rollup2
TO TRAIN NOT.

00:28:11.657 --> 00:28:14.526 region:rollup2
A TRADITIONAL CONTRACTOR HAS

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:16.428 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR SPECIFIC

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:18.063 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT HE CAN RUN THROUGH WE

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:19.398 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE EVERY PIECE.

00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:21.233 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT IN THE CATALOG SO WE

00:28:19.398 --> 00:28:23.035 region:rollup2
HAVE A DIVERSIFIED WELL TRAINED

00:28:21.233 --> 00:28:25.003 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE SO TILL IT'S A LITTLE

00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:27.573 region:rollup2
BIT THE RATE OF A AFFECT OUR

00:28:25.003 --> 00:28:28.173 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

00:28:27.573 --> 00:28:29.274 region:rollup2
THAN A TRADITIONAL CONTRACTOR

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:30.142 region:rollup2
HOUSE UP.

00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:32.144 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST VENTURE TO SAY THAT

00:28:30.142 --> 00:28:33.812 region:rollup2
THE LEG THAT THIS BILL IT'S A

00:28:32.144 --> 00:28:34.346 region:rollup2
BIT SMALL ITSELF IS CONSISTENT

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:35.814 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:28:34.346 --> 00:28:37.382 region:rollup2
SIMILAR EXEMPTIONS TO JOB CORPS

00:28:35.814 --> 00:28:39.318 region:rollup2
EXEMPTION ALREADY MAKES THE SAME

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:40.419 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION THAT THIS IS AN

00:28:39.318 --> 00:28:42.487 region:rollup2
ONEROUS REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN

00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:44.456 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS SO.

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:45.891 region:rollup2
THIS ALREADY IS BEING DONE AND

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:47.392 region:rollup2
WE ARE JUST SEEKING THIS VERY

00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:49.094 region:rollup2
MINOR.

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:50.329 region:rollup2
A EXEMPTION FOR THIS PROGRAM

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:51.463 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU BE OPENED LAST

00:28:50.329 --> 00:28:53.098 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF APOLOGIZED I WOULD

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:54.666 region:rollup2
VISITORS WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:56.935 region:rollup2
EXPANDING THE EXEMPTION FOR

00:28:54.666 --> 00:29:01.406 region:rollup2
CRANE OPERATORS --

00:28:56.935 --> 00:29:03.041 region:rollup2
BROADLY IN THE FUTURE.

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:03.609 region:rollup2
SO I THINK I THINK WHAT WE'RE

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:05.510 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IS AN INCREDIBLY

00:29:03.609 --> 00:29:06.778 region:rollup2
NARROW EXAM FOR THE

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.447 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:10.015 region:rollup2
NOT GENERATING REVENUE RIGHT.

00:29:08.447 --> 00:29:11.683 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRAINING PEOPLE IT'S LIKE

00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:13.552 region:rollup2
GOING TO COLLEGE AND YOU'RE NOT

00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:15.487 region:rollup2
GOING TO GIVE THEM A NEW MILLION

00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:17.155 region:rollup2
DOLLAR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO TO

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:18.824 region:rollup2
TRAIN ON UNTIL IT'S YOU KNOW IT

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:20.092 region:rollup2
THIS IS HAND ME DOWN FROM THE

00:29:18.824 --> 00:29:22.427 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS THIS IS NOT.

00:29:20.092 --> 00:29:22.995 region:rollup2
BRAND NEW IN FLEET STUFF THAT

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:23.862 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA BE RUNNING YOU

00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:25.530 region:rollup2
KNOW.

00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:27.265 region:rollup2
THREE SHIFTS A DAY PERK FOR ROAD

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.233 region:rollup2
PROJECT IN AND TO INVEST THAT

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:30.035 region:rollup2
CAPITAL.

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:31.270 region:rollup2
IN SOMETHING THAT THAT'S ONLY

00:29:30.035 --> 00:29:33.505 region:rollup2
GONNA GET TWO HUNDRED HOURS OF

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.239 region:rollup2
USE IN A YEAR WOULD BE.

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:37.175 region:rollup2
IT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:37.776 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL SENSE --

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:39.378 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THE JOB

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:40.212 region:rollup2
CORPS.

00:29:39.378 --> 00:29:40.712 region:rollup2
WOULD RECEIVE THEIR EXEMPTION IT

00:29:40.212 --> 00:29:43.515 region:rollup2

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:44.149 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO APPLY THIS TO TO TWO

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:45.150 region:rollup2
HUNDRED OR LESS IN TWO HUNDRED

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:45.984 region:rollup2
VEHICLES THAT.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.419 region:rollup2
ARE USED FOR LESS THAN TWO

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:49.288 region:rollup2
HUNDRED HOURS IS FAIRLY

00:29:47.419 --> 00:29:51.523 region:rollup2
REASONABLE IN TERMS OF ALSO

00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:52.624 region:rollup2
LIMITED. TO TO TO GO TO OUR

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:53.925 region:rollup2
THREE LOCATIONS IN THE STATE OF

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:55.927 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SOME OF THESE

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:57.362 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS ARE CROWE TRAINED WITH

00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:58.730 region:rollup2

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:03.135 region:rollup2
SHIRTS AYE I I I ACCEPT THE

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:04.102 region:rollup2
PREMISE BEHIND THE THE BILL I

GO ENTERED THE WORKFORCE THAT

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:11.176 region:rollup2
ONE ISSUE THAT THERE ARE MORE

00:30:09.775 --> 00:30:11.943 region:rollup2
CRANE OPERATORS --

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:13.612 region:rollup2

APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM OR THEIR

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:18.317 region:rollup2
BODIES GRADUATES AND SO MY HOPE

00:30:16.615 --> 00:30:19.418 region:rollup2
IS THAT IF WE COULD PROVIDE SOME

00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:21.853 region:rollup2

WERE ABLE.

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:29.394 region:rollup2
TO HIRE MORE THESE GRADUATES AND

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:30.896 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE MORE

00:30:29.394 --> 00:30:32.798 region:rollup2
GRADUATES WE HAVE MORE EMPLOYEES
