UNTIL SHE GETS HERE. A COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS THE SPEAKER HAS APPOINTED THE SOME OF THEM ARE KEVIN MCCARTY TO REPLACE THREE OF US TODAY. AND WE HAVE ONE ITEM FILE ITEM FIVE SB SEVEN NINETY PROPOSED CONSENT. AND WE'LL START WITH THAT SIGN IN ORDER OUR FIRST AUTHORS HERE FALLEN FOR SB FIVE THIRTY ONE CENTER GLAZER. VERY BEGIN THE SEARCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER ACTING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- FIVE THIRTY ONE SIX TO STOP PERVERSE INCENTIVES IN OUR CURRENT TAX CODE THAT HAVE LED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GIVE AWAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE TO PRIVATE COMPANIES. THESE DEALS TAKE MONEY FROM EVERY CITY IN THE STATE. AND GIVE IT TO SOME OF THE RICHEST CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD. UNDER THE BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORM UNIFORM LOCAL SALES TAX LAW. SALES TAX REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE POINT OF SALE. FOR BRICK AND MORTAR STORES THIS MEANS ALLOCATING THE REVENUE TO THE JURISDICTION THE STORES LOCATED IN. ONLINE RETAILERS HOWEVER HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY ALLOCATE SALES TAX REVENUE. HE THAT A WAREHOUSE DISTRIBUTION CENTER OR SALES OFFICE. THIS ALLOWS COMPANIES TO DIRECT REVENUE TO A SINGLE JURISDICTION IN THE STATE. CORPORATIONS USE THIS AS LEVERAGE WHEN NEGOTIATING WHERE TO LOCATE WITHIN CALIFORNIA. THIS RESULTS IN A RIG PROCESS DRIVING CITIES TO ACCEPT INCREASINGLY ONEROUS TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. IN EXCHANGE FOR ONLINE RETAILERS BUILDING OR RELOCATING IN THEIR JURISDICTION. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS PRIVATE COMPANIES. PROFIT FROM BOTH THEIR ON LINE SALES AND FROM THE SALES TAX REBATES OFTEN CITIES WILL GIVE THESE CORPORATIONS MORE THAN HALF. OF THEIR SALES TAX REVENUES ALLOCATED TO THAT JURORS TO THEIR JURISDICTION. HE'S COMPANIES BENEFIT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC. AT A TIME WHEN CITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND PUBLIC PROGRAMS. COMPANIES ARE SIPHONING BILLIONS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS [inaudible] FURTHERMORE. WHILE THESE AGREEMENTS ARE OFTEN TOUTED FOR CREATING JOBS AND HAVING SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS. THESE CLAIMS ARE DUBIOUS IN FACT IN YOUR ANALYSIS -- TODAY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S AS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT THAT SPECIFIC CLAIM. SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE THAT THE PROMISE JOBS ARE EVER CREATED. AND EVEN WHEN THEY DO. THE JOB TO THESE WAREHOUSES ARE OFTEN GRUELING LOW WAGE AND LACK BENEFITS. CITIES NEED REAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING FAMILIES NOT A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. FOR THESE REASONS SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WOULD PROHIBIT ANY FUTURE SALES TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES. IT HAS NO EFFECT ON ANY EXISTING. AGREEMENT IT TAKES NO MONEY FROM ANY CITY. AND IT DOES NOT REDUCE THE SALES TAX REVENUE TO ANY CITY CAN RECEIVE IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION -- CITIES LIKE PLACENTIA RANCHO CUCAMONGA AND COURSE LEAGUE OF CITIES DAN CHARACTERS HERE REPRESENTING THEIR POINT OF VIEW. THANK YOU. MR -- CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAID JACK YOU'RE GONNA BE AWFULLY GOOD CALIFORNIA CITIES -- THE CONTENTS OF THIS BILL ARE CONSISTENT WITH -- IS A RECOMMENDATION FROM A LEAGUE SUCH HOUSE FORCE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT ISSUES RELATED TO BRADLEY BURNS INTERNET. OF COMMERCE -- SOME OF THE CHANGES -- IN ORDER -- TO TO OUR TO OUR REVENUES -- CAUSED BY YOU COMMERCE AND THOSE TRENDS -- CONTINUING. ONE OF THE THINGS ARE OR ARE WORKING GROUP BUT YOU COLLUDED CITY MANAGERS FROM A VARIETY OF OF CITIES AROUND THE STATE RECOMMENDED IS THEY FELT THAT THESE THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS INDEPTH CONSOLIDATING. A REVENUE IN ONE LOCATION OUGHT TO BE A BAND PROSPECTIVELY AND AS THE AUTHOR SAID OF IT DOESN'T AFFECT ANY EXISTING AGREEMENTS -- IT STILL ALLOWS COMMUNITIES TO USE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITH THEIR OWN REVENUES -- AND SOME AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU TO SHOW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE ANGIE MINETTI HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF FRESNO RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- ALTHOUGH THE BILL DOES GRANDFATHER IN EXISTING AGREEMENTS -- WHICH WE HAVE THREE AGREEMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- BUT WE STILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE BECAUSE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION THROUGH THE USE OF THESE TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS -- AND HAVE EVEN DRAWN BUSINESS AWAY FROM OTHER STATES BECAUSE OF THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS -- THESE ARE NOT CORPORATE GIVEAWAYS WE ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR CONTRACTS ARE. JOB BASED -- WE OFFER INCENTIVES THAT ARE DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO FULL -- FULL TIME JOBS WITH BENEFITS AND HAVE DIFFERENT ON SKILLS THAT STEP DOWN FROM THAT AS WELL. I THINK I AM YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEEN PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT WITH -- BUT IT WITH THIS ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE INHERENT ADVANTAGES. YET IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC STRUGGLES RELATED TO JUST OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE -- ARE POVERTY RATES AS WELL AND SO WE'VE TAKEN IT UPON OURSELVES TO PURSUE -- THIS TYPE OF TAX SHARING AGREEMENT TO BE COMPETITIVE AND ATTRACT THOSE TYPES OF JOBS FOR OUR REGION. AS A RESULT OF THE THREE CENTERS THAT WE HAVE IN FRESNO WE HAVE UP TOWARDS FOUR THOUSAND NEW JOBS THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN -- TAKEN BY WELL FORMER WELFARE TO WORK RECIPIENTS -- OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS GONE FROM DOUBLE DIGITS TO SINGLE DIGITS NOW WHICH IS -- WHICH IS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS -- WE BELIEVE. WHAT I THINK THAT IT WHAT THE POLICY QUESTION THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS IS -- YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT UNFOUNDED WE WE DON'T REALLY SEE HOW THESE TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE BENEFITTED DISADVANTAGED THESE. ARE NOW COMING TO A PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW THERE ARE THE WHERE WHERE WE NEED TO COMPLETELY PROHIBIT THEM -- YOU KNOW WE DO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND THE MAYOR FRESNO BACK WHEN HE WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER MEMBER DID PASS ORDINANCES TO DO SO AND SO. WE WOULD URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE TODAY AND PRESERVE OUR ABILITY TO EXERCISE OUR LOCAL CONTROL AND OFFER THESE TYPES OF INCENTIVES MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU TO SHOW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MICHELLE WELCOME ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF PARIS ALSO UNFORTUNATELY STILL OPPOSED TO SB FIVE THIRTY ONE A CITY OF PARIS IS A VERY SMALL TOWN. SOUTH OF LOS ANGELES AND VERY FLAT DOESN'T. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF AVENUES TO CREATE DEVELOPMENT IN OUR CITY AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE HIS ACTION AGREEMENTS TO GROW. OUR SMALL CITY AND FACT BEFORE THESE TEXTURE INTERMENTS WERE IN PLACE WE HAD AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 16% INNER CITY AND DUE TO SPECIFICALLY TO THIS TAX RETURN AS WE'VE BEEN ABLE. TO REDUCE THAT TO SIX POINT 7% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN ADDITION SOME OF THE JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE SEA COMMERCENTRE IS PAY UPWARDS OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. I ALMOST OF TWO TWENTY FIVE DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR JOB POSITION THERE'S ALSO SOME MANAGERIAL JOBS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE THE PAY. IN EXCESS OF SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IT IS BEEN -- A LIFESAVING TOOL FOR THE CITY OF PARIS UP UNTIL VERY RECENTLY THEY'VE STRUGGLED WITH GENERATIONAL POVERTY AND TO BE HONEST WE WE UNDERSTAND AND BE WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT TAX YOU AGREEMENTS AND MAYBE SOME OF THE CONCERNS. AND HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT THE ELIMINATION OF ON WORD AND FORWARD GOING TAX CHURNING REMAINS DOES PUT THE CITY OF PARIS IN A POSITION WHERE IT PLACES A GLASS CEILING ABOVE THEIR HEAD AND WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE GRANDFATHER CLAUSE WHICH WILL. KEEP SOME OF OUR EXISTING AGREEMENTS ATTACK BUT IT IS BASICALLY TELLING US THAT THERE WILL BE NO ADDITIONAL GROWTH FOR OUR PARTICULAR CITY FOR THAT REASON WE'RE OPPOSED. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS I'M KEEP TELLING YOU HAVE TO CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION HERE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION WE DO APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE GRANDFATHERING IN UNDER THE BILL EXISTING AGREEMENTS BUT I THINK THAT I WOULD JUST CAUTION THAT ELIMINATION OF THEM OUT RIGHT WILL AND DEFINITELY HAVE AN IMPACT IN. CALIFORNIA IT'S AN ECONOMIC TOOL FULL GOVERNMENTS TO UTILIZE ATTRACTING BUSINESS -- IN LOCATION IS IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE DECIDING WHETHER COME TO CALIFORNIA AT ALL OREGON STATE SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SEEING ON A BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR CORP YUP WAREHOUSE JOBS IN PARTICULAR. ARE CITED. NEAR WHERE THE DELIVERIES ARE GOING TO BE MADE. MAYBE INSTEAD OF GOING TO FRESNO IT MIGHT HAVE GONE TO A NEARBY CITY. BUT EITHER WAY THE JOBS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE REGION. ALL WE'RE DOING HERE IS LOSING TAX MONEY -- AND ONCE YOU START THIS ALL THE OTHER CITIES HAVE TO COMPETE. IN THE END NOBODY HAS A PARTICULAR ADVANTAGE. SO I I JUST DO NOT AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION. ARTS CENTER GLAZIER THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BILLS I'VE EVER SEEN IN REVENUE TAX. IF YOU ARE HAPPEN -- TO BE TAKING AMENDMENTS TO GET ON THE BILL AT SOME POINT I'D LOVE TO BE CO AUTHOR THANK YOU ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. SEEING NONE SENATOR GLAZERS REALLY CLOSE. I JUST THANK YOU FOR THE CONSIDERATION ALL THE CITIES THAT FOR THAT THAT OVER HERE TODAY THEY THEY CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE AGREEMENTS. THEY JUST CAN'T READ ME DATE THE MONEY. BACK TO THE COMPANIES THEY CAN USE THEIR TAX REVENUE FROM LOTS OF OTHER SOURCES TO TO TRY. TO ATTRACT BUT I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK THAT -- IT'S PLAN PEOPLE AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THE LOSERS OF THE PUBLIC -- THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND THEIR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS SAID THAT -- THAT WE GIVE AWAY A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WOULD NORMALLY GO TO PUBLIC AGENCIES CITIES AND COUNTIES. TO THOSE COMPANIES IN THESE DEALS THINK ABOUT THAT A BILLION DOLLARS THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO GRAB BACK -- BECAUSE THEY WHAT THEY DO THEY SAID WE'LL WE'LL MOVE TEN MILES DOWN THE ROAD -- AND AND CAN COME TO YOUR TOWN AND THAT'S THAT'S PLAN AGAINST EACH OTHER THAT'S A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. BELIEVE ME I LOVED ELIMINATE THESE ENTIRELY BUT THIS IS A SMALL STEP FORWARD TO TRY TO NOT MAKE IT WORSE AND I APPRECIATE THAT SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER WILL TAKE THAT ITEM UP ONLY GET A QUORUM THANK YOU. NEXT WE'LL. HEAR FILE ITEM ONE SB FORTY THREE BY CENTER I'LL. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- WE APPRECIATE. TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TALK ABOUT THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- FOR ITS WORK ON THE BILL. I'M SO THIS BILL REQUIRES OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO SUBMIT A REPORT ON THE FEASIBILITY AND PRACTICALITY. OF CALCULATING THE CARBON INTENSITY OF RETAIL PRODUCTS. THAT ARE CURRENTLY SUBJECT IN SALES AND USE TAX. INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA SO -- OUR CURRENT MY MIDDLE PROGRAMS SUCH AS CAP AND TRADE -- PLAY AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN REDUCING EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA BUT THERE ARE A WIDE ARRAY OF FACTORS THAT. INFLUENCE CONSUMER PRICES THAT OFTEN MASK THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND CONSUMERS IN MANY RESPECTS ARE UNABLE TO SAVE MONEY BY CHOOSING KARMIC CLIMATE FRIENDLY ALTERNATIVES THIS IS A ONLY A STUDY BILL -- BUT I I DO THINK IT WOULD HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND -- THE THE CHALLENGES THE OPPORTUNITIES THE DOWNSIDES THE UP SIDES OF OF THE FEASIBILITY THE PRACTICALITY OF DETERMINING TYPE CARBON INTENSITY WHICH WOULD YOU KNOW COULD MAYBE ONE DAY. REPLACE THE STATE SALES AND USE TAX WITH THE REVENUE NEUTRAL -- CARBON PRIVATE PRICING MECHANISM BASED ON THE CARBON. INTENSITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THOSE IN OPPOSITION. TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND I ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE NOW THAT WITH ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE TAKE IN -- THE OPPOSITION ALL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL HAS BEEN REMOVED -- I HAVE WITH ME TODAY IS ABOUT GONZALEZ POTTER FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY CHRISTINE SHOEMAKER FROM BASEL FREE CALIFORNIA. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANKS FOR HAVING US MISTER BY STERN MEMBERS MANY AS HE'S AVAILABLE SALAS PART IN POLLY'S POLICY ASSOCIATE WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IS THE LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL NONPROFIT IN THE WORLD WITH OFFICES IN ALL FIFTY STATES HERE IN THE U. S. AS WELL AS IN SEVENTY TWO COUNTRIES. THE CONSERVANCY RECOGNIZES THE ONGOING NEED TO CURB EMISSIONS AS WE FACE THE GREATEST EXISTENTIAL CRISIS OF OUR TIME CLIMATE CHANGE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS MEASURE IS A STUDY BILL AS THE GOOD CENTER HAS SAID. MEANT TO PROVIDE THE STATE WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY INFORM THE DISCUSSION ON HOW WE COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS EVEN FURTHER. SPECIFICALLY BY REQUIRING CARBS TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER THERE ARE FEASIBLE AND PRACTICAL MECHANISMS FOR ASSESSING AND ASSIGNING. CARBON INTENSITY TO RETAIL PRODUCTS SUBJECTS TO THE CEILING USE TAX LAW. AT THIS POINT WE NEED ALL THE INFORMATION WE CAN GET TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE MOST EFFECTIVELY. THIS SHOULD INCLUDE EXAMINING THE SALES AND USE TAX AS A POTENTIAL MECHANISM. LAST FALL THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE THE I. P. C. C. ISSUED A REPORT -- THAT I'M SURE MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH. HIGHLIGHTING THE GLOBAL URGENCY TO BECOME CARBON NEUTRAL IF NOT CARBON NEGATIVE BY MID CENTURY TO KEEP OVERALL TEMPERATURES FROM RISING. MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS THIS REPORT FOLLOW THE PARIS AGREEMENT WHERE COUNTRIES COMMITTED TO KEEP TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW TWO DEGREES CELSIUS. AS COMPARED TO PRE INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURES. TO AVOID THE MOST CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER ON THE CLIMATE FRONT BUT WE WILL NEED TO DO MORE IF WE WANT TO DO OUR PART. TO HELP ME NOT ONLY THE PARIS COMMITMENTS AND IPCC REPORT GUIDANCE. AT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE SEE SB FORTY THREE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND TO THE VIABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ANOTHER TOOL. THIS TIME FOCUSED ON CONSUMERS TO HELP US IN THIS EFFORT AND REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND POTENTIALLY OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS. WE ARE JST PART FOR THIS BILL SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHETHER CHANGES TO THE SALES AND USE TAX COULD BE PART OF THE SOLUTION THANKS FOR TIME. THANK YOU. SO -- ACTING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRISTINE SHOEMAKER I'M A RETIRED PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGISTS IN A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF FOSSIL FOR CALIFORNIA. ALSO FOR CALIFORNIA'S A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION HAS OVER SEVEN THOUSAND ONLINE SUPPORTERS WHICH WORKS TO LIMIT -- CLIMATE DAMAGING FOSSIL FUELS AND PROMOTED JUST TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY -- THIS BILL FITS WITH OUR MISSION THE PROBLEM CLIMATE CHANGE AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS SAID IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. AND WE NEED -- FAST DRAWDOWNS AND A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. IF WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE COMPANY IS IN THE ECONOMY. SO THE CARBON INTENSITY DETERMINATION -- IS THAT AND IT NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENT AND STANDARD AND ACCURATE. AND CARP HAS BASICALLY ALREADY DONE THIS ALREADY FOR THE FUELS IN THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. SO IT FITS WITH THEIR EXPERTISE TO SEE IF IT'S FEASIBLE TO DETERMINE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE SALES AND USE TAX -- WE THINK THAT PASSING THIS MESSAGE PASSING THIS ALL. ON BILL WOULD SEND A STRONG MESSAGE TO MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS ALIKE THAT THE CARBON TEN CITY OF PRODUCTS -- MADE SOLD AND BOUGHT IN CALIFORNIA ARE IMPORTANT TO THE STATE AND THEY FIT WITH THE STATE'S OF GOALS. ADDITIONALLY -- IF IT CAME BACK THAT THIS WAS FEASIBLE THEN THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT WOULD BE. DETERMINING CARBON INTENSITY FOR A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S DEFINITELY NEEDED INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE GOOD BOTH FOR THE MANUFACTURERS. AND THE CONSUMERS -- IF OF IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR CONSUMERS LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS ALIKE TO UNDERSTAND AND MAKE BETTER AND SMARTER ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS. AND WE WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL SO WHAT WE URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BECAUSE WE DO FEEL THAT -- TO MEASURE WE NEED TO MEASURE AND LIMIT CARBON LIKE OUR PLANET DEPENDS ON IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LOOK AT US HERE ON BEHALF OF STOP WASTE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ROSALIE ROTH SACRAMENTO THREE FIFTY IN SUPPORT ALSO SILICON VALLEY THREE FIFTY ALSO SELF BAY LA. THREE FIFTY THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WAS QUIRK CHAU [inaudible] AMAZON. CELLS TWELVE MILLION PRODUCTS NOT INCLUDING BOOKS MEDIA WINE AND SERVICES. WHEN AMAZON MARKETPLACE SELLERS ARE FACTORY AND THE TOTAL PRODUCT COUNT THIS IS SEPARATE ES QUE USE? BALLOONS TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE MILLION AND THAT'S JUST AMAZON THEIR OTHER SELLERS AS WELL ON THE WEB AND RETAIL. HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY [inaudible] DETERMINE -- THE CARBON CONTENT. FOR HALF A BILLION PRODUCTS. YOU KNOW WE WE TRY OUR BEST I MEAN -- IN THE END OF THE DAY -- THIS IS ABOUT. REALIZING THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS ON OUR HANDS WHOM IS CHALLENGE. AND THEN -- AND THEN BASICALLY TASKING A GROUP THAT HAS BEEN WORKING REALLY INTENSELY IN THIS AREA FOR A LONG TIME. WITH -- WITH THE WITH A RESPONSIBILITY IN A ROLE TO TO TO TO TRY ITS BEST. AND AS I SAY IF THEY COME BACK WITH A WITH A MECHANISM OR THEY IF THEY SAY THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE IT'S ON FEASIBLE. WE WALK AWAY FROM THE ISSUE WE DON'T PURSUE IT FURTHER BUT I DO THINK THAT -- THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT IF YOU LOOK AT AT ALL SORTS OF PRICING MECHANISMS OF YOU LOOK YOU LOOK AT THE VA T. SYSTEM IN EUROPE I MEAN IF YOU WOULD HAVE FIRST SUGGESTED DOING THAT THAT WAS SOUNDED PRETTY COUPLE NOTED THE V. A. T. IS JUST VALUE ADDED. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S ADDED EACH DAY H. PRICES QUITE A PROCESS. WITH [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] SO -- WE WE WE WE WE WE BASICALLY TASK THEM WITH WITH TAKING A LONG HARD LOOK AT THIS. AND THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT MODELS ALL OVER THE WORLD -- YOU KNOW NETHERLANDS HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THIS AREA [inaudible] AND AND THEY COME BACK TO US WITH WITH THIS WITH WITH A SERIES OF FINDINGS WELL. LET ME JUST SAY MY SON DID HIS THESIS WORK. ON LEDS VERSUS FLUORESCENT BULBS AND LOOKING AT THE LIFE CYCLE. THAT TOOK MONTHS OF WORK. AND NOW YOU'VE GOT HALF A BILLION PRODUCTS AYE AYE PERMISSION TO USE. A PROP WITHOUT OBJECTION ALL RIGHT SO THE ISSUE IS CURRENTLY MADE IN THE U. S.. SHOULD SHOULD THE THE MANUFACTURER DECIDED TO OUTSOURCE TO CHINA [inaudible] OR MALAYSIA [inaudible] OR BOTH -- IT'LL HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT CARBON FOOTPRINT I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS PRACTICAL. GO AHEAD THROUGH THE CHAIR I I I WILL SAY -- THAT THE BILL. CALLS ON IDENTIFYING CERTAIN GROUPS OF PRODUCTS THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE MOST EMISSIONS SO SO IT IT IS VERY LIKELY TO BE HONEST. THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE SMALLER ITEMS THAT WERE LOOKED AT THE WOULD JUST DESCRIBE WHAT WOULD WOULD BE COVERED VERY DIFFERENTLY -- MAYBE THERE'D BE A ANY A LOOK AT THE AT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT ASSOCIATED WITH DISTRIBUTION -- BUT BY. THE BILL BUT BUT THE BILL I I ANTICIPATES WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT EXPECTING THE AIRPORT TO GO INTO EVERY [inaudible] SMALL ITEM --IT'S ABOUT TRYIN TO MOVE THE MOVE THE NEEDLE. MON THE MACRO LEVEL RELATING TO CARBON INTENT SO THE DID THE QUESTION ABOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF ETHANOL FOR USE IN VEHICLES. HAS BEEN DEBATED FOR YEARS IT'S STILL THE SUBJECT OF LAWSUITS. I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS CAN BE DONE. IF SOME IF YOU ARE YOU ONE OF YOUR EXPERTS WOULD LIKE. TO ANSWER I I JUST DON'T SEE WAY TO DO IT. WELL I WOULD DO DID YOU WANT TO I MEAN I I WOULD SAY THAT WE TRY OUR BEST WITH ALL THESE KINDS OF THINGS RIGHT I MEAN HOW YOU KNOW THAT THEIR THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF ESTIMATES THAT WE USE. TO ESTIMATE EMISSIONS RIGHT WE WE WE TRY OUR BEST AND WE NOTHING IS PERFECT -- BUT TO SAY THAT. THAT IT'S AN IMPERFECT SCIENCE AND THAT THAT SHOULD MEAN THAT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING IN THIS AREA I THINK WOULD BE A BIG MISTAKE GIVEN THE SIZE AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH -- WITH CARBON IMPACTING CLIMATE CHANGE. AND SO AS I SAY. WE GOT SOME SMART PEOPLE OVER THE AIR BOARD -- WE WOULD WE WOULD TASK THEM WITH TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF FEASIBLE. MECHANISM IF BEING HOME BACK TO US AND SAY YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THIS SO WE WE WE JUST IT'S TOO IMPRACTICAL IT'S TOO AND FEASIBLE. THAT WE DON'T PURSUE IT OKAY THANK YOU. DIGITAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISS PETRIE-NORRIS. YOU MENTIONED AT THAT SOME OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE STARTED TO TAKE SOME DECENT STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT READ MORE AND PERHAPS TALK ABOUT HOW THEY'VE MADE. ARE THERE SOME PRACTICAL EXAMPLES WHERE WE'VE GOTTEN TRACTION WITH THIS KIND OF APPROACH. YES OF THE NETHERLANDS IS IS FOR THE MOST ADVANCED IN THIS AREA AND THEY HAVE -- YOU KNOW CREATED THIS. THE SYSTEM THAT WE CAN GET YOU SOME INFORMATION THE OECD'S BEEN BEEN REPORTING ON THIS BUT THEY BASICALLY GO THROUGH -- THROUGH SECTORS AND THE LOOK AT CARBON EMISSIONS AND THEN THEY THEY'LL THEY'LL GO THROUGH AND AND KIND OF DO A DEEP DIVE INTO EACH OTHER SECTORS AND AND LOOK AT PRODUCTS. WE NEED EACH OF THOSE SECTORS WHERE THEY CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE THE MOST -- AND AND SO I I'M NOT A EXPERT IN THEIR PRICING SYSTEM -- I DON'T KNOW IF ONE OF THE TWO NEW CAPS AND CONDITIONAL THOUGHTS ON THE WAY THEY STRUCTURE WE CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU INFORMATION AS TO THE MOLLEN BASE STRUCTURED -- BUT THEY YOU KNOW THEY THEY BUT BUT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS IS I I KNOW THEIR FOCUS KIND OF GETTING BACK TO THE EARLIER QUESTION NEED TO REALLY FOCUS IN ON I AND 80% OF CAR OF CO TWO EMISSIONS. AS OPPOSED TO EVERY PRODUCT RIGHT THERE THEY'RE NOT SPENDING ALL THEIR TIME. ON AND ON THE ON THE HIGH HANGING FRUIT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE IT'S IT'S ABOUT THE BITS ABOUT WHERE MOST OF THE PROBLEM IS AND REALLY FOCUSING IN ON THOSE KINDS OF ITEMS AND PRODUCTS. BECAUSE IT WRAPS THE RIGHT WE CAN'T WHICH WE'RE NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND YOU KNOW I I AND AND AND FIGURE OUT A MECHANISM FOR FOR PRICING. EVERY MINISCULE ITEM. AND IN THE IN A THAT WOULD BE A WASTE OF OUR TIME AND OUR RESOURCES THERE ARE CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE REALLY. CAUSING THE MOST DAMAGE IN TERMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AYE AYE THE SUN MEMBER BETWEEN OURS I CAN SHARE WITH YOU. THIS CHART HERE -- SURE THOSE ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT THEY WERE NOT WAITING FOR ANYONE ELSE AT THIS TIME OKAY. HERE TAKE A LOOK. IF THE CHAIR IS OKAY. ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YEAH THIS IS IT. WELL ON THE FIRST PAGE ANYWAY IT'S INFORMATION WE ALREADY HAVE LIKE WHICH INDUSTRIES ARE MOST CARBON INTENSIVE. AND AS FAR AS MANUFACTURING GOES WE ALSO KNOW WHICH ONES ARE MOST COMMON IN. MOST CARBON INTENSIVE PARTICULARLY -- MAKING CONCRETE AND CEMENT RIGHT EYES ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN THE INDUSTRY -- AND THEREFORE TWENTY OF OUR BIG TARGETS. ANYWAY ALL RIGHT WELL THAT'S YEAH THEIR ATTENTION YEAH THAT'S MEANT AND THE THING IS WE'RE ALREADY DOING THAT SO. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR BECAUSE WE ALREADY LOOK AT YOU KNOW IN THE INDUSTRIES PARTICULARLY SAMANTHA. OF WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST -- IMPACTORS AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AND THEY HAVE TO PAY ALREADY A CARBON TAX FOR THAT. FOR THE CO TWO THEY GENERATE. AND IN GENERAL FOR THE INDUSTRIES HERE IN THE US IF THEY'RE GENERATING CO -- TWO AT LEAST IN CALIFORNIA WERE KEEPING TRACK OF THAT -- AND THEN IT BECOMES VERY COMPLEX AS WE DO CAP AND TRADE BUT THIS IS. THIS JUST GOES WAY BEYOND THAT MAYBE OR MAYBE NOT I'M JUST NOT SURE EXACTLY THE LEVEL OF DETAIL. AND WOULD YOU SAY YOUR BILL WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THEY GO INTO. OUR EXTENT YES -- BETTY BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REPLACING THE SALES TAX WHICH IS ON EVERY ITEM. REST IF I READ YOUR BILL CORRECT ALL IDEA WOULD BE IF IF IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS THERE IS THERE IS A THERE THERE WITH REGARDS TO THIS STUDY. THE IDEA IS THAT WE COULD LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING RID OF SOUTHEAST TAX ALTOGETHER. AND REPLACING IT WITH A REVENUE NEUTRAL. TAX ASSOCIATE WITH CARBON INTENSITY. I JUST. THAT THEY'RE A LOT AT OF OF OPEN QUESTIONS RIGHT I MEAN IF IF IF. IF YOU ARE WORST FEARS PROOF FOUNDED. AND THIS ENDS UP BEING TOTALLY IMPRACTICAL UNTIL YOU FEASIBLE. YEAH THE ANSWER BACK AS HEY YOU KNOW LOVE THE IDEA LOVE THE KIND OF GENERAL CONCEPT BUT THE OTHER DAY THIS IS NOT GOING TO ONE ON THE GROUND IN TERMS IMPLEMENTATION OKAY I KNOW THIS BUT I WILL SAY THE HOUSE THE SEXES IS IS. SO MUCH BIGGER THAN CAP AND TRADE I MEAN IT CAPITA RAISES VERY SMALL -- BUT BUT THE OTHER IDEA HERE IS THAT WE WOULD NOT RAISE TAXES ON TO SAY THIS WOULD THIS WOULD BE REVENUE NEUTRAL WOULD BE GETTING RID. OF AN ENTIRE [inaudible] TAX ALTOGETHER. IF YOU DO IT BY INDUSTRY GROUPS. THEN HOW TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO BUY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CEMENT NO MATTER WHAT. THERE'S ALREADY -- CALCULATIONS FOR LOCAL CEMENT COMPANIES. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS OUT WITH CAP AND TRADE BUT IF WE DO BY INDUSTRY GROUPS THEN THERE'S NO REAL SUBSTITUTION OF AVAILABLE SO I'M NOT SURE. THAT THIS WOULD DO ANY GOOD. ANYWAY I JUST HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS. IF THAT POINT YOU HAVE TO THEN GO INTO -- INTO KIND F SPECIFIC ITEMS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY BUT THE BUT THE POINT BEING YOU'RE GONNA FOCUS ON THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST INTENSITY. NUMBER YOU CAN REALLY FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION FIRST. OF THEIR SOME THIS THIS A MINISTRY THAT GET COUNTERFEITING YOU 20%. OF EMISSIONS I'VE YOU'RE GONNA YOU'RE GONNA REALLY DIG IN ON THOSE KINDS OF THAT SORT OF INDUSTRY THAN BEEN WAY OUT SO WE FIVE SAMANTHA WIND. ALSO FUELS IS ANOTHER WERE ALREADY DOING WORK ON THOSE BIG ISSUES I'M NOT SURE. THAT TAKING A LOOK AT SHOOTERS FOR EXAMPLE NOW WE WE CAN RATE THEM IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY THEY DO AND I THINK THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THAT. FOR A LOT OF ITEMS THAT DO USE ELECTRICITY I JUST DON'T SEE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GONNA. REALLY BE ABLE TO INCENTIVIZE OR FOR THIS -- BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLES CAN BE VERY HARD TO DETERMINE. YOU KNOW IN CHINA HOW MUCH CARBON USE THERE IS TO MAKE THIS LAPTOP VERSUS BAT LAPTOP. RIGHT TO THE EXTENT THAT -- THAT THERE ARE BOARDS ARE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA ACTUALLY WILL BE LESS COSTLY THAN HAD BEEN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. I'M IN FACT I KNOW THAT THE LATEST AND YEAH ESTIMATES FOR THE BECAUSE THIS BILL OF DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY I THINK IT'S PARTLY HAVING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS IN WORDS ARE YOU HAPPY. AREA -- MEDIATOR THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT TRYING. TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EVERYTHING YOU'VE JUST DESCRIBED MMHM AND SEE IF THERE IS A WAY. TO TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN A FEASIBLE PRACTICAL WAY. CURRENT THANK YOU ANSWER IS NO YEAH WE WE DON'T MOVE ANY WE DON'T FEEL FOR WITH IT. OKAY THANK YOU. I KNOW THAT DID YOU WANT. TO WELL I WAS JUST GONNA SAY. AS FAR AS INDUSTRIES TO LOOK AT BEYOND CEMENT AND COMPUTERS THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE SUCH AS FABRICS SHOES HOUSEWARES. THE LIKE IN THE PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT THE LOOK OF LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS OF THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. POINT SIX CENTER THAT YOU WOULD. DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM IS MOST OF THOSE ARE GENERATED ARE MADE OVERSEAS THE ONES PARTICULAR FABRIC. AND IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD TO REALLY GET A RELIABLE NUMBER. THAT COULD BE TRUE AYE AYE I YES MA'AM IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE LAW A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH THEY HAD DETERMINED SOME OF THE CARBON INTENSITY ON SOME OF THAT ACTUALLY IS COMING FROM DEFINITELY COMING FROM OUT OF STATE -- SURE SEES BUT THEN THAT'S HAVE LAWSUIT TO TED STUDIES FOR YEARS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THIS. IT IS A MAJOR RESEARCH PROJECT AND FOR I'M JUST SKEPTICAL A WE CAN DO IT BE THAT TACK. THAT ONE INTO THE DEAD DID YOU ACTUALLY ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE ISSUE USES LESS CARBON THE NATURAL. YOU CAN DETERMINE MAYBE THEY CHOOSE USE LESS CARBON THEN ARE MORE CARBON THAN -- PHILIP FLOPS YOU COULD PROBABLY DO THAT BUT ANYWAY IJUST I THINK I'VE I THINK WE DISCUSSED IT AS MUCH AS WE CAN. TOTALLY GET YOUR POINT -- I THIS A BILL BE LOOKING INTO ALL THESE KINDS OF ISSUES -- BUT BUT YOU KNOW. IF YOU EITHER I GUESS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE POINTS IS IS THAT. IF WE IF WE DO HAVE A STATICALLY ONE OWN COURAGE MORE OF ONE ITEM THAT IS LOCAL LAST CAR WRITTEN OTHER. RIGHT NOW THE SALES AND USE TAX IS JUST. THE SAME AMOUNT FOR EVERYTHING REGARDLESS. HI AND MAYBE THERE OUGHT TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A NEXUS. OKAY WELL I SHOULD LET YOU GO. THIS IS THE STUDY IT'S JUST A STUDY. AND I I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE. IT'S A WORTHWHILE STUDY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEN AND I HAVE JUST A QUICK. THEY JUST GOT HERE I THOUGHT I'D SAY SOMETHING -- I I I KNOW IT'S JUST A STUDY I JUST MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT -- SALES TAX AND USE TAX IS GENERALLY REGRESSIVE. AND ALTHOUGH THIS IS JUST A STUDY I AM SUPER CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BE DERIVED FROM THIS KIND OF BILL AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. I AM ON RECORD AND AND THAT WE YOU AND I FOLLOW UP AND HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHATEVER. LEGISLATION YOU DO PERCEIVE TO COME FROM THIS -- IS VERY VERY AWARE THAT IT'S COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THAT SO OFTEN END UP TAKING THE BURDEN FOR ISSUES LIKE THIS AND AND AND THAT WOULD BE OF GREAT CONCERN FOR ME SO I UNDERSTAND TO STUDY IN THEIR GREAT THINGS THAT CAN CAN COME FROM THE STUDY. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE VERY AWARE OF THE CONCERNS OF MINE AND OF THE COMMITTEE UNTIL YOU GET IT AND IN PART -- WE DISCUSSED IS THAT IS THAT. IF IT WERE TO BE FOUND AND THERE'S SOME VERY THERE WITH REGARD TO THIS WORK. ONE OF THE IDEAS WOULD BE IN FACT MIKE. KIND OF FOUGHT COMING INTO THIS WITH THAT WE WOULD GET RID OF THE PROGRESSIVE CELLS USE TAX ALTOGETHER. AND THAT IT WOULD BE REPLACED WITH THE REVENUE NEUTRAL -- YEAH CARBON INTENSITY PRICE RIGHT THAT THAT COULD BE REGRESSIVE TO THAT CAME OUT VERY WERE GOING TO POINT IS THEY'RE BOTH. LIKE I WE WOULD WE WOULD NOT BE RAISING TAXES ON SOCIETY. AND THAT BUT YOU'RE UPS RIGHT YEAH HOW WOULD WE MAKE SURE TO ENSURE EXACTLY BECAUSE THAT YES QUITE OFTEN IT IS. ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE REVENUE NEUTRAL IT IS COMMUNITIES LIKE MY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD TAKE THE BURDEN ON SOMETHING THAT WAS WAS I HAD A CAR HIGHER CARBON IMPACT WE JUST. YOU KNOW AFFORDABILITY COMES INTO PLAY AND SO ARE THE END UP BREAKING IT SO SO JUST SO SOMEWHERE AT LISTEN YOU AND I WORK VERY VERY WELL TOGETHER I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S ON THE RADAR THAT SOMETIMES THESE THINGS DO -- END UP COST ALTHOUGH REVENUE NEUTRAL AND OF COSTING COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE MORE MAYBE WE OUGHT TO LOOK IT'S IT'S ADDING ON THE BILL LANGUAGE THE BILL I WAS. HAPPY TO THAT MEETING THANK YOU I'D APPRECIATE IT THINK. HE WAS IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION RIGHT I THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT AND THEN THERE WAS THERE WAS LANGUAGE IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION ABOUT LOOKING ABOUT. IN IMPACTS OF CERTAIN -- CATEGORIES ON ON LOW INCOME CAN CONSUMERS AND THAT WAS. IT'S GONE NOW BUT THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE SOMETHING TO ADD BACK THANK YOU KNOW IT CAME OUT BECAUSE OF TOLL AND RELATED ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH A DIFFERENT MECHANISM IN THE BILL SO LET'S WORK TO GET THAT LANGUAGE LET'S WORK TO WORKS OF SUBSIDIES AND THANK YOU. WE APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU I WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ROBUST DISCUSSION AS A STATE. JUST TAKING A LOOK AT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND AND HOW WE MAY. HAVE A CLOSER NEXUS BETWEEN SOME OF OUR BROADER CLIMATE GOALS AND AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH SPENDING SOME TIME LOOKING AT AND AND CERTAINLY FOR TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE. IF THIS BILL IS ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD I HAVE A WITHOUT A RESPECT FASTER ABOUT THANK YOU ARE STILL A SUBCOMMITTEE BUT AS SOON AS WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL TAKE IT WILL TAKE UP. THE REGULAR BUSINESS. THANK YOU -- MOVING TO AND SENATOR MCGUIRE FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO SB THREE FORTY FOUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. MADAM CHAIR OF THE TO PROCEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HONORED TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE WITH OUR HARD WORKING STATE TREASURER MISS YOUR MOM SB THREE FOUR FOUR PROVIDE A ONE YEAR SUNSET EXTENSION TO ALLOW. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COLLECT ON LOCAL UTILITY USER TAX IS FOR RETAIL SALES A PREPAID WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT SAID NO WAY NO WAY FOR COLLECTING LOCAL YOU YOU TEASE ON PREPAID WIRELESS -- EQUIPMENT AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN ESTABLISH A COLLECTION MECHANISM SIMILAR TO A SALES TAX WHERE THEY'RE COVERED APARTMENT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION COLLECTS ALL LOCALLY DRIVE UTILITY TAXES FOR ME TELL SELLS AND DISTRIBUTES THOSE REVENUES. TO THE CITY OR COUNTY WHERE THE PURCHASE TO PLACE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IT'S WORTH ABOUT TWENTY FOUR MILLION.

MOVING A FILE ITEM THREE AS BEFORE. SIXTY EIGHT SENATOR JACKSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. IF YOU GO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS A MEASURE THAT I THINK REALLY DOES. ENCAPSULATE WHAT GOOD GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED. TO TO CONSIDER THIS IS A MEASURE THAT'S GOING TO HELP US UPDATED IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM OF TAX CREDITS TAX DEDUCTIONS. AND TAX EXEMPTIONS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MAKING THE BEST USE OF LIMITED PUBLIC DOLLARS. AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE UP FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL AND I WILL BE TAKING AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. THOSE ITEMS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH REMOVED THE LA ALL -- AS THE RESEARCH ORGANIZATION PERFORMING THE ANALYSIS -- AND REPLACING IT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WHERE I THINK THERE ARE WE WILL SEE A FAR LESS POTENTIALLY POLITICIZED FOR MORE OBJECTIVE ACADEMIC YOUR VIEW ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE? LOOKING TO ADDRESS AND THE BILL ALSO SUNSETS THIS -- COMMITTEE A RATHER THE THE THE ENTITY THAT'S GOING TO BE DOING THE ANALYSIS SIX MONTHS AFTERWARDS SO WE WILL NOT BE A PERMANENT ENTITY. IT MAY AT SOME FUTURE TIME BRADY. BE RECONSTITUTED IF WE DECIDE. TO LOOK FURTHER ADD OTHER. OF THESE TAX. EXPENDITURES -- BUT THIS WILL SUNSET IN THE BOARD ITSELF WILL -- TERMINATE AFTER THE WORK OF ANALYZING THE TAX EXPENDITURES AND THEN REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE IS COMPLETED -- AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT WERE CLARIFYING SO TO CERTAIN TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT. AND THE GOAL HERE IS TO GET AN OBJECTIVE VIEW OF WHETHER OR NOT THESE TAX EXPENDITURES THAT WE PUT INTO PLACE. ANYWHERE UP TO FIFTY SIXTY YEARS AGO ARE STILL RELEVANT -- NOW STARTING IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND BEYOND WE ACTUALLY ARE DOING THAT WITH ALL OF THE NEW OR TAX EXPENDITURES BUT THE OLD ONES THEY'RE STILL THERE THEY'VE NEVER BEEN EVALUATED THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ANALYZED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE. FUNCTIONING AS THEY WERE INTENDED AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE BUT STILL BENEFITING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND PARTICULARLY THE TAXPAYER. SO WE NOW HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURES THERE PROVISIONS IN THE TAX CODE EYES I MENTION WITH CREDITS DEDUCTIONS SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS INCOME EXCLUSIONS. THAT REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TAX COLLECTED IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT IS AN INTENDED PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COMMISSION THIS OUR RESEARCH ORGANIZATION IS GOING TO DO THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK WHAT WAS THE DESIGN PURPOSE HASN'T MET THAT PURPOSE IS IT STILL MEETING THEIR PURPOSE. AND THEN IT'S GOING TO BRING THAT DATA BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IN FACT TO THE BOTH THE ASSEMBLY GEO COMMITTEE. AND THEN THE SENATE GEO COMMITTEE -- TO HOLD A JOINT PUBLIC HEARINGS TO CONSIDER THE UC'S REPORT AND THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN -- EXCUSE ME -- I MISSED A STEP BECAUSE THIS IS DONE IN SORT OF TRANCHES SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THIS AS OBJECTIVE. AND A NON PARTISAN AS POSSIBLE SO AFTER THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DOES ITS RESEARCH -- IT WILL PRESENT ITS FINDINGS TO A NON PARTISAN BOARD COMPRISED OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S THE STATE AUDITOR AND THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE OR THEIR DESIGNEES. ANNA REPRESENTATIVE WITH THE STATE TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION WHAT THEY WILL DO IS SELL CONSIDER THIS INFORMATION AND MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEGISLATURE -- AS TO WHETHER THE TAX EXPENDITURE ISSUE IS MEETING THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED OR WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE ALTERED CONTINUED OR REPEALED. THEN THE THAT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR JOINT HEARINGS BETWEEN THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE IN THIS COMMITTEE. TWO AT WITH PUBLIC INPUT. TO CONSIDER THE UC'S REPORT AND THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN AGAIN THAT BOARD WE'LL SUNSET SIX MONTHS THEREAFTER SO. THE GOAL HERE IS TO GET THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO EVALUATE THESE PAST EXPENDITURES BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT THE STATE THAT IT COULD GET. FORTY CENTS OF THAT DOLLAR WOULD GO TO EDUCATION AND THE OTHER 60% COULD GO TO OTHER PROGRAMS NOW IF THESE FUNDS IF THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE SAY WE'RE GONNA KEEP. BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE NO MECHANISM IN PLACE NOW TO ADDRESS THESE PAST TAX EXPENDITURES WE HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE. THIS IS SOMETHING I ACTUALLY THAT CAME TO MY ATTENTION WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO INTO THE ASSEMBLY AND WONDERED WHY WE HADN'T DONE THIS. AND SO I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT HERE WE ARE WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY. WITH YOUR MEMBERS WITH THE CHAIR AND I THINK WE'VE GOT THAT SWEET SPOT HERE THE GOAL IS NOT TO HAVE ANY BIAS GOING IN IT JUST ASK THE QUESTION IS IS WORKING. DO WE WANT TO CONTINUE WITH IT AND THEN MAKE THE DECISIONS GOING FORWARD SO I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. AND SERRA ABACHA'S WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY HOPE FOR A A MOTION AND A SECOND AND THE APPROVAL OF THIS COMMITTEE WITH YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION CTA'S PLEASED TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF SB FORTY EIGHT WAYS POR SIXTY EIGHT WHICH PROVIDES A DEEPER LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY INTO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST EXPENSIVE TAX CREDIT AND EXEMPTIONS. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT TO BELIEVE THAT THIS BOARD WOULD BE A MONUMENTAL STEP IN OBJECTIVITY AND TRANSPARENT EVALUATION WHICH CALIFORNIA NEEDS AND HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES. THE TOTAL CUMULATIVE COSTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THESE ITEMS INCLUDED IN MEASURE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS ASSIST SIXTY SIX POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. IRONICALLY THIS IS AT THE SAME TIME THAT CALIFORNIA WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT RECESSION SO SOME MAY ASK. WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED IN HOW CALIFORNIA IS SPENDING TAX CREDITS FOR CTA WELL I'LL TELL YOU? DURING THE SAME DECADE CALIFORNIA WAS SPENDING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SOLELY ON THE MOST EXPENSIVE TAX CREDITS AND EXEMPTIONS CALIFORNIA CUT SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM ITS PUBLIC SCHOOLS LEADING TO DECIMATING CUTS FOR STUDENTS. AND AS A SENATOR NOTED FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR OF A TAX CREDIT FORTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR IS MONEY THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO FUND OUR SCHOOLS. SO WHAT WE WANNA KNOW IS WHERE IS ALL OF MONEY GOING IF CALIFORNIANS SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON INCENTIVES THING CALIFORNIA SHOULD KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GETTING ITS RETURN ON INVESTMENT. IN ADDITIONALLY IT'S NOT ENOUGH IN THE STATE IS TO SIMPLY SAY WERE CREATING JOBS HOW DO WE SPECIFICALLY NO THOSE JOBS REALLY EXIST WHO'S GETTING THEM ARE THEY PART TIME JOBS ARE THEY FULL TIME JOBS. WERE THESE TEMPORARY JOBS THAT NO LONGER EXIST ARE THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE GETTING THE JOBS COMING NOW OF ELIMINATING ECONOMIC OCT OPPORTUNITIES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THESE TAX CREDITS AND EXEMPTIONS COST CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS OVER THE PAST DECADE -- TWENTY SIX POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS SO IMAGINE THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES A LONG TERM ECONOMIC OUTPUT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CREATED. SHOULD THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN SCHOOLS WHICH THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION A SYNDICATED COULD BE A MORE LUCRATIVE ECONOMIC INVESTMENT. NOW THAT SAID WE'RE NOT ADVOCATING FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THESE ITEMS BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS HIGHLIGHT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE TAX DECISIONS SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ABLE TO HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF DISCUSSION. OF THE TRADE OFFS THAT ARE IN HEARING IN THE SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN CREATED FROM PAST LEGISLATURE'S. THESE ECONOMIC DECISIONS OF THE PAST NEED TO BE EVALUATED ON THEIR LONG TERM MERIT SO THAT YOU CAN ASSURE THAT ALL OF THE ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THIS LEGISLATURE MATCH CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT VALUES. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SERRA BOTCHES WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS IN SUPPORT OF SB. FOUR SIXTY EIGHT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION PUBLIC EDUCATION EXPERIENCE DRASTIC BUDGET REDUCTIONS WITHOUT ANY RECONSIDERATION OF ONGOING TAX EXPENDITURES TO PROVIDE THE STATE WITH FISCAL RELIEF. SB FOUR SIXTY EIGHT ESTABLISHES A PATH FORWARD TO INSURERS CALIFORNIA HAS A SYSTEM TO EVALUATE TAX EXPENDITURES REVIEWING THEIR ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENSURE PUBLIC FUNDS ARE SPENT WISELY. WE APPRECIATE SENATOR JACKSON'S RECOGNITION THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WHICH FUNDS EDUCATION WASHED OVER THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND SUPPORT IN THE PAST DECADE DUE TO THE RE DIRECTION OF FUNDS TO TAX EXPENDITURES. PLEASE SUPPORT ESTABLISHING A SUNSET PROCESS TO ENSURE OUR STUDENTS AND OUR EDUCATORS ARE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN EXEMPTIONS THAT MAY NO LONGER MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT HIS NAME AN AFFILIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MARC THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND WE HAVE THE CESSATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ACCENTS FROM SUPPORT.

THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WHO UNFORTUNATELY COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY WE ARE LISTED IN OPPOSITION BUT I WOULD. NOTICE CENTER JACKSON KNOWS THAT THE COALITION IS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED -- WE HAD RAISED CONCERNS REGARDING THE BUREAUCRACY THAT. IS BEING CREATED BY THE LEGISLATION AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT THERE ARE ADEQUATE -- EVALUATION METRICS -- WHEN THE BOARD AND IN THIS CASE THE UC EVALUATES THESE A HANDFUL OF BUSINESS TAX EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS? THAT WE DID RECEIVE THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE THE AUTHOR ACCEPTED TODAY IN COMMITTEE EARLIER THEY'RE STILL UNDER EVALUATION THEY'RE CERTAINLY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF -- MADAM CHAIR AS WELL AS THE SENATOR AND HER STAFF. AND SO AS SOON AS WE GET A FOR WE WILL -- GET BACK TO THE AUTHOR IN YOUR COMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO NOTE THE TWO QUICK ITEMS OR THREE ON THE AMENDMENTS JUST UPON MY OWN EVALUATION. THE AUTHOR DID INDICATE THERE IS A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT REGARDING ONE OF THE SUNSET DATES. AND ALSO IN PROPOSED SECTION FORTY THREE CE -- THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE ABOUT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- PROVIDING RELEVANT TAX PAYER DATA TO THE UC -- I THINK WE'D RATHER SEE SOME SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA REVAN TAX CODE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS OF THE REVENUE TAX CODE TO ENSURE TAX PAYER CONFIDENTIALITY AND WE WOULD CERTAINLY WANT ANY TAXPAYER. A SPECIFIC DATA AGGREGATE OBVIOUSLY IS DIFFERENT BUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS REFERENCE -- TAXPAYER DATA SO WITH THAT WE ARE STILL TECHNICALLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED BUT APPRECIATE ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHORS TAKE IN YOUR AND YOUR COMMITTEES WORKED ON THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR NOTES.

LAUREN HIGGINS REPRESENTING BY A CALM AND ADMIT THE ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION OPPOSING LESSON AND COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- AT MISTER GRAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. CENTER I FOUND MYSELF -- TORY ON THE BILL -- ON ONE HAND I APPRECIATE THE THE PREMISE OR THE THE EFFORT. TO PUT. SUNSET DATES -- INTER RIGHT FOR PUZZLE SO THE LEGISLATURE REGULAR REVIEWS WHICH I THINK IS ABSOLUTE GOOD HABITS. FRANKLY WE OUGHT TO PUT A LOT MORE SUNSET DATES -- IN A LOT MORE BILLS -- HAVING SAID THAT. THE THE NOTION OF OBJECTIVITY I FIND A LITTLE ABSURD. AND I THINK IF YOU TAKE A VIEW POINT OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS -- OF THE LEGISLATURE. ALONG WITH THE USHERING OF TERM LIMITS WE USHERED IN A LOT OF INDEPENDENT OBJECTIVE OBJECTIVE -- COMMISSIONS AND ENTITIES AND AGENCIES. AND AND THEN WE ARE SHOULD A BUNCH OF WHAT WE ARE SHOULD OUT ALL INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY WERE POLICY EXPERTISE WE ARE SHOULD IN A BUNCH OF LEGISLATURES WHO FOR MANY YEARS WERE HERE FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS. AND WHO WERE HAPPY -- TO SEAT ANY AUTHORITY OR RESPONSIBILITY TO A MUCH UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS WHO FRANKLY HAVE DONE FOR THE MOST PART A TERRIBLE JOB. NOW SOME OF YOU -- AND SOME OF THE FOLKS IN OUR BODY MAY APPRECIATE THAT TERRIBLE JOB THEY'VE DONE BECAUSE IT MIXES WITH THEIR IDEOLOGICAL -- YOU KNOW BENT OR VIEW POINT -- BUT DOESN'T SERVE CALIFORNIANS WELL AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN YOU COME AND SAY OKAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE A REVIEW BOARD. THAT HAS THE CONTROLLER OR CONTROLLER DOESN'T ME THE LA -- THE STATE AUDITOR. THESE ARE NOT INDEPENDENT OBJECTIVE PEOPLE THESE ARE THE CONTROLLERS ELECTED AND THEIR POINTY IS GOING TO BE -- CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PERSPECTIVE THERE'S NOT REALLY SUCH THING AS AN OBJECTIVE. POINT OF VIEW. IF THERE WERE WE WOULDN'T SEE EFFORTS SOME IN SOME OF THE BEST. EXPENDITURES FOR EXAMPLE OF G. G. R. F. MONEY. IT OUR BATTLE AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE BEEN IN THE AREA -- THERE IS I REPRESENT RIGHT WE DIDN'T ALICE'S SOME YEARS AGO AND USE YOUR OF MONEY AND FOUND OUT THAT. YOU KNOW FOR FIFTY OR SIXTY DOLLARS -- AT A METRIC TON -- WE WERE GETTING THE BEST VALUE IN CARBON REDUCTION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT WAS MOST THE MONEY SPENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY APPS WE NOT. YOU KNOW SPEND A FIVE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS METRIC TON IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE BAY AREA -- YEAH WHEN IT COMES TIME TO EXPAND A CREDIT FOR EXAMPLE FOR PRODUCTION COMPANIES NOW LAY THERE'S ALL THE OVERWHELMING VOTES FOR IT WHEN IT COMES -- TO DO TAX CREDITS FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES THERE'S NOT RIGHT SO I WOULD SUGGEST THERE'S VERY LITTLE OBJECTIVITY ANY THIS THERE'S POLITICS AS USUAL -- AND I WOULD PREFER TO KEEP MY POLITICS AS USUAL RIGHT HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE'RE ALL ACCOUNTABLE WHETHER IT'S MR QUIRK IN HIS DISTRICT OR ADAM GRAY IN HIS WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE VOTERS AND EXPLAIN OUR POSITIONS -- AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO VET THESE TAX PROPOSALS NOT TO KICK IT. TO SOME ALLEGEDLY OBJECTIVE BOARD THIS GONNA GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS BACK TO US -- SO FRANKLY I WOULD KIND OF SAY TO OURSELVES LET'S JUST DO OUR JOB -- NOT CREATE MORE UNACCOUNTABLE UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS -- BUT HAVING SAID THAT I LIKE THE INTENT OF WHERE YOU'RE GOING -- I THINK I'M GONNA LAY OFF. TODAY BUT WOULD WELCOME AN ONGOING CONVERSATION ON THE SUBJECT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE RAISING I MEAN TAX MANAGERS OUR PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS -- BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KIND OF PUT TO BED THIS NOTION THAT THERE'S THESE OBJECTIVES THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED DEMOCRACY BECAUSE WE CAN JUST FIND OBJECTIVE BUREAUCRATS TO MAKE OUR DECISIONS. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD GOVERNMENT AND I DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT MEASURES THAT -- THAT LEND THEMSELVES TO THAT TYPE OF THINKING. SIR IF I MAY RESPOND THAT'S WHY THIS IS THREE THE CARD THREE LEVELS THE FIRST LEVEL IS UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE RELY UPON THEM FOR A LOT OF THE RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE. AND THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN. SPECIFIC MANDATE TO LOOK AT THESE AND TO CONSIDER A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FACTORS -- AND THAT IS THEIR JOB IS TO COME UP WITH THE DATA. THE SECOND IS TO TAKE THAT DATA AND TO BRING. TO BRING FORWARD A SO THAT'S OF THAT'S THE FIRST LEVEL IS THE FACT FINDER. THE SECOND LEVEL IS -- ELECTED OFFICIALS -- WHOSE EXPERTISE IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN MONEY. IF YOU WILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CONTROLLER AND THE OTHER OF THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT FOLKS. THEY WILL THEN COME WITH THE REPORT THAT WILL COME TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE THE LEGISLATURE IS ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE WE WILL TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS -- GATHER THE EXPERTS IN IN TAX AROUND FROM BOTH. THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE HAVE PUBLIC HEARING SO WE CAN GET THE INPUT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS AND THEN IT WILL BE UP TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO -- WITH ALL THE INFORMATION AND THE DETERMINATIONS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND EITHER APPLY THE RECOMMENDATIONS OR NOT. AND I SHARE WITH YOU I REPRESENT THE CENTRAL COAST WE'RE NOT VERY WELL LISTEN TO EITHER VERY MUCH THE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SENATE SEEMS TO SOMETIMES SKIP OVER US. TOO SO I AND I APPRECIATE THE THE FRUSTRATION BUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS ESSENTIALLY PULL BACK THE CURTAINS AND CREATE SUNSHINE FOR PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE NEVER EVALUATED. SO IF YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY I THINK IT ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE AND I SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION BUT I I DON'T THINK THAT'S QUITE WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IN THIS BILL -- DOCTOR PARK AND THEN MR MAYES. SO -- I'M HOPING I CAN BIG MISTER GRAY OVER TO A NIGHT BUT WE'LL SEE -- WITHOUT DATA WE ARE FLYING BLIND. NOW I LOVE THE R. D. TAX CREDIT. I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL BUT I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW IF WE LOSE INDUSTRIES IF WE DIDN'T HAVE IT -- YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN -- AND I I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL LOOK TERRIBLY CLOSELY AT WHAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAYS BUT I'M SURE AS HECK AND LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT NUMBERS. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE WILL PRESENT. SO ARE WE ARE FLYING BLIND WITHOUT IT NOW I REALLY. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE I WOULDN'T SUPPORT THE ARE ANTI TAX CREDIT BUT LET'S SEE WHAT THE DATA SAYS ARM. ANYWAY -- I'D LIKE TO THIS POINT MOVE THE BELL. ALL RIGHT AND THEN -- IF YOU COULD IF YOU DO AMEND THE BILL AGAIN I'D LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS A ACTUALLY BUT MISTER GRAY MOVE ME ON THIS ONE I WAS -- ACTUALLY GOING TO SUPPORT THIS -- TODAY AND I THINK I'M YEAH I THINK I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO LAY OFF AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY -- YOUR INTENT IS RIGHT -- I THINK WE SHOULD KNOW -- YOU KNOW. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AS A REPUBLICAN I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF TAX CREDITS -- BUT I VOTE FOR THEM OFTEN DUMB AND I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF TAX CREDITS BECAUSE I THINK OUR TAX RATE IS TOO HIGH -- I'M SOMEBODY IS SAID IN FACT I HEAR ALL THE TIME HERE IN THIS BUILDING THAT WE SHOULD BE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AND YET GUESS WHAT WE DO -- WE PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS. AND I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS LEGISLATURE GOT TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO ACTUALLY OUR JOB AND THAT'S WHERE MISTER GRAY GOT ME IS ACTUALLY OUR JOB TO DO THAT THE REASON I JUST I WANT TO BE ON THE REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE. WAS BECAUSE I HEARD BACK IN DECEMBER THAT WE WERE THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO DO COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM AND I WANTED TO BE A PART. OF THAT OF THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE OF MY BACKGROUND IT IS OUR JOB TO DO THAT. IN ADDITION TO NOT JUST GOING IN STUDYING AND UNDERSTANDING -- WHETHER WE HAVE TOO MANY CORPORATE LOOPHOLES -- BUT THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE SPEND TOO MUCH MONEY AND PROGRAMS WHETHER THERE'S AN EFFICACY WITH THE DOLLARS THAT WE SPENT I'M SO I THINK PARTLY THIS IS A BIT INCOMPLETE AS WELL. IT IS OUR JOB AS THE LEGISLATURE TO DO TO DO THIS WORK WE SHOULDN'T KEEP. YOU KNO DELEGATING THIS TO OTHER -- COMMISSIONS IN KING COUNCILS WE HAVE TOO MANY OF THEM ALREADY AND IN LARGE PART IT'S BECAUSE AS A BODY WE DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE DIFFICULT. AND FOR THAT REASON I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY AS WELL IF I IF I COULD JUST KEEP ASKING KEEP AN OPEN MIND SHOP OF THE SECOND COURSE I WILL. THE FIRST IS THE DATA THE SECOND IS THE ANALYSIS IF YOU WILL THE THIRD IS IT IS COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE -- INFORMATION THAT CAN THEN BE PROPERLY ANALYZED BY THIS COMMITTEE. AND BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE. IN CONJUNCTION AND HOLDING PUBLIC HEARINGS AT WHICH POINT. EITHER WAY. YOU CAN CHOOSE WHEN WE CAN CHOOSE AS A LEGISLATURE TO ACT OR NOT ACT AND WE CAN ACT ANY% WAY WE WANT WE'RE NOT BOUND BY ANYTHING. THAT IS GOING TO COME TO US BASICALLY I SEE IT AS A WAY TO HELP US FOCUS. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS. YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE TAX CREDIT SHELTER FROM THE NINETEEN FORTIES. WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES HERE IN FACT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE MOVED THE RESEARCH FROM THE LA ALL. TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S BECAUSE WE DON'T OF THE RESEARCH MECHANISM HERE TO DO THAT IT RESEARCH TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT THESE TAX CREDITS ARE AND HOW THEY HAVE. IMPACTED HOW THEY'VE COMPLIED OR OR PERFORM BASED UPON THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE SO THAT'S THE FIRST STEP THE SECOND IS THAT INFORMATION WILL THEN COME TO THIS GROUP OF OF EXPERTS IF YOU WILL WHO ARE ELECTED BUT ARGUABLY BUREAUCRATS I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THEY RUN. DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WHERE THERE IS A CERTAIN EXPERTISE AND IT IS THEN BROUGHT TO WATCH AS A LEGISLATURE. TO DO WITH AS WE WISH TO DO WITH SO THERE WERE RESPONDING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS TO THE PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE IS A STATE TO THE ISSUES THAT ARE COMING BEFORE US AT THE TIME. I WILL TELL YOU TEN YEARS AGO WE WEREN'T LOOKING FOR MONEY TO DO TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM BUT WE ARE TODAY. AND WHO KNOWS WHAT IT'LL BE IN A YEAR OR TWO OR FIVE BUT IT WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE. TO MAKE THOSE FINAL DECISION SO WE'RE NOT ABROGATING RESPONSIBILITIES TO ANYBODY ELSE THEY ARE PROVIDING US WITH THE INFORMATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WE CAN ACCEPT OR WE CAN REJECT. AND I AND THE IDEA THAT WE THEN ALLOW THE PUBLIC PUBLIC COMMENT SO THAT WE CAN GET INPUT FROM THOSE WHO DISAGREE. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE OTHER THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS THAT WILL COME BEFORE THIS BODY FOR THE ULTIMATE DETERMINATION WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GIVING AWAY. ANY OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES I BELIEVE WITH AT THE WAY THAT WE'VE TRIED TO SET THIS UP. ULTIMATELY THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT WILL BE UP TO WATCHES A LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THOSE IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS. IN THAT I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU WITH ALL OF THAT I THINK JUST THE QUESTION IS WE OFTEN HAVE THESE DO THESE STUDIES MAYES ARE SET ON THE SHELF AND AND DO NOTHING THE UC CAN DO THIS WORK THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ALREADY HAS THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE. TO DO SOME OF THIS WORK AND I I FEEL AS THOUGH THIS IS SORT OF A A PASS FOR US THAT WE WE WE GO WELL GO STUDY IT BUT THEN WE DON'T DO MUCH. ABOUT IT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HOW MUCH WE SPEND OUR DOLLARS AND I DON'T THINK WE WE GET THE MOST EFFICIENT BANG FOR OUR BUCK IN THE WAY WE SPEND MONEY. NOR DO I THINK THAT WE ARE OUR TAX SYSTEM -- GENERATE THE REVENUE THAT WE NEED TO BE COMPETITIVE IN A GLOBAL MARKETPLACE -- SO AGAIN I THINK THAT IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO DO THAT WORK I JUST DON'T WANT TO TO TO DISH THAT OFF TO SOMEBODY ELSE. I'M. REALLY QUICKLY JUST FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES WE DID LOOK AT THE LA L. -- BECAUSE WE DO THE COMMITTEE FELT LIKE THE LA -- WAS PROBABLY THE BEST PLACE SOME PLACE THAT WE ALL TRUST THE LA -- DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY NOR DO WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO FIND THEM IN A WAY THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM THE THE STAFFING TO DO THIS THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO ONE OF BECAUSE THESE ARE SUCH LARGE INSTEAD BECAUSE THEY'RE SO CONFERENCE IF. THEY WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO DO ONE A YEAR AND THAT WE DID NOT FEEL AS EFFICIENT WHICH IS WHY WE MOVED IT OUT OF THE LA -- JUST SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT ELLIE -- WAS THE INITIAL -- WAS THE INITIAL CONCEPT IT THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY NOR DO WE HAVE THE FUNDING MECHANISM IN PLACE TO ALLOW OURSELVES TO FIND THEM TO MAKE THEM. CAPABLE OF DOING IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. SAID SENATOR LIKE YOU AND LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I WOULD SAY I THINK WE NEED TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE SPENDING OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT ELECTED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO ACTUALLY QUITE RECENTLY. NOT SERRATION I'VE HAD IS YOU KNOW WE PASS A LOT OF LINES. WE HAVE A LOT OF PRESS CONFERENCES AND WE DON'T ALWAYS DO A GOOD JOB AT LOOKING BACK AND SAYING. IS THAT MONEY GOING WHERE IT WAS INTENDED TO GO IS THAT MONEY HAVING THE IMPACT IT WAS INTENDED TO HAVE I'M SO I WOULD I WOULD ECHO ADD ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES COMMENTS. TERMS OF THIS ONE BEING PART OF THE EQUATION RIGHT TO THE SUCCESS. AT TAX EXPENDITURES THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER EXPENDITURES I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A MUCH. MUCH BETTER LOOK AT AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I ASSURE SOME OF THE CONCERNS AROUND FIVE UNITS THE BUREAUCRACY AND MAKE SURE THAT. THIS ISN'T JUST SOME THE REPORT THAT SITS ON THE SHELF BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS IS BY HAVING BETTER DATA SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING. I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY. WILL NOT LET THIS **** ON A SHELF. ESPECIALLY IF THERE ARE RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING INAPPROPRIATELY AT LEAST FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE SPENT AND THERE WILL BE A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS GOING FORWARD. AS THERE SHOULD BE AND I AGREE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT AREAS THIS IS ONE CHUNK OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE INDICATES THAT. BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WILL HAVE BEEN A FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR LOSS IN REVENUE TO THE GENERAL FUND SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. AND THAT'S MONEY AT GOING FORWARD THAT UNLESS IT'S REALLY SERVING ITS DESIGN PURPOSE AS WE THE LEGISLATURE. DETERMINE -- THEN IT'S MONEY THAT IS NOT BEING A PROPERLY SPENT TWO TO RESPOND TO THE TAXPAYER WHICH IS OUR ONE OF OUR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES AS WELL MR TANG. THANK YOU MA'AM TRUMP'S GONNA PICK UP ON WHERE ARE CHAIR OF SORTS LEFT OFF I THINK THIS -- THIS TYPE OF LOOK IS LONG OVERDUE WE DON'T WE DON'T EVER LOOK AT TAXES WE CANNOT I I PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST COMMITTEE STAFFER BUDGET COMMITTEE WE DON'T HAVE. ANYBODY WHO REALLY IS THERE FOCUSED ON JUST LOOKING AT TAX EXPENDITURES EVEN THOUGH TWO HUGE. PORTION OF OUR BUDGET EVERY SINGLE YEAR -- IN ADDITION AS A CHAIR MENTIONED ALEJO'S NOT STAFF WITH THIS. AND I THINK IT IS LONG OVERDUE THAT WE DO. TAKE A HARD LOOK AT MONEY THAT WE ARE APPROPRIATING EVERY SINGLE YEAR BUT WE DON'T REALLY APPROPRIATE DOESN'T GO THROUGH COMMITTEE. DOESN'T REALLY GO THROUGH A BUDGET BILL SO JUST GIVE ME SCRUTINY IT DOESN'T REALLY GET THE KIND OF THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS THAT WE NEED. SO I I REALLY APPRECIATE -- YOU GET TO STAB AT IT -- HI I'M I HAVE A COUPLE -- UP YOU KNOW. DIFFERENCES DOWN THE ROAD BUT OVERALL I THINK THIS IS GREAT TO ACTUALLY TAKE A HARD LOOK. AT WHAT OUR WHAT OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE GOING TO HOW THEY'RE BEING SPENT. AS AS MR PARK SAID HE IS THE MONEY ACTUALLY GETTING THE KIND OF RESULT. WE THOUGHT IT WOULD IN THE ANALYSIS ON YOU KNOW I'M I'M LIKE MR MAYS I'M NOT A HUGE FAN A TAX CREDITS BY FOR MYSELF VOTING FOR YOU KNOW. A LOT MORE THAN I'D LIKE OR THAT I DON'T THINK I SHOULD PARTLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET THE TAX CREDIT. THERE WAS ALSO A GOOD IDEA. WE WE ALMOST RARELY UNLESS WE SANTA SET THEM NOW WE'VE GONE TO A GOOD HABIT OF DOING THAT. EVER LOOK BACK TEN YEARS LATER HEY DID ACTUALLY WORK TO DO THE ANALYSIS THAT SAID HE WAS GOING TO WORK ACTUALLY PAY OFF I THINK. THAT THIS IS ON LONG OVERDUE TO EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S VERY FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS THE LARGEST PART OF OUR BUDGET THAT WE NEVER LOOK AT NEVER. SO I THINK IT IS -- REALLY PUSHING. YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND HAPPY TO SUPPORT MISTER MALONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU SENATOR -- FOR BRINGING THE BILL LIKE MR TANG I THINK -- THIS KIND OF A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW IS OVERDUE -- IT'S WELCOMED. A DEEP LOOK AT THE VALUE OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURES GIVEN SORT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE OVERALL BUDGET. BUT LIKE MY COLLEAGUE MISTER QUIRK FROM EAST BAY I AM A FAN OF THE RD. TAX CREDIT I'VE -- WE ARE BRACING FOR FIFTEEN THOUSAND NEW JOBS JUST IN MY HOMETOWN OF SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO BUNCH OF IT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FAVORABLE. TAX ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA FOR THESE KINDS OF JOBS BUT I MYSELF HAVE NOT DONE IT. DEEP LOOK AT THE OVERALL VALUE SO IT IS WORTHY TO HAVE THE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION. MY EXPECTATION IS HOWEVER WHEN THIS REPORT COMES BACK -- TO THIS BODY AND THE AND THE EQUIVALENT BODY OF THE SENATE THAT WE WILL LOOK AT EACH AND EVERYONE OF THE SITE. IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL HAVE HEARINGS BUT IT'S NOT AS THOUGH WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT AN OMNIBUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WITH ALL OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WRAPPED UP LIKE. OCCASIONALLY WILL HAVE BLUE RIBBON TASK FORCE AND SO FORTH AND AND A OF A BIG PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT'S ALL ENCOMPASSING MY EXPECTATION. IS THAT WE WILL LOOK AT EACH AND EVERYONE OF THESE LIKE WE NORMALLY DO HI IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. TO TO EVALUATE THE REPORT -- BITE AT MY EXPECTATION IS THAT THIS COMMITTEE IN PERFORMING ITS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WILL ALSO BRING IN OTHER FOLKS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PREVIOUS PROCESS -- BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THESE -- I THINK ON THE MERITS -- ABROAD REVIEW BY THIS BODY -- TO ACT AS SOMETHING OF A CHECK FRANKLY ON THE OUTSIDE A REPORT AND THAT'S GENERALLY HOW THESE THINGS WORK WITH THAT THAT'S CORRECT YEAH. THE ONCE THAT THIS IS A WE'RE SETTING UP A PROCESS. AND THEN IT COMES TO THE LEGISLATURE THE ONLY PART OF THAT LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. IS THAT WE WE CALL FOR JOINT HEARINGS -- FOR THE REV REVENUE TAX. A COMMITTEES TO GET TOGETHER AND TO HAVE SOME PUBLIC HEARINGS WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT. REALLY THERE THE BILL IS SILENT BECAUSE I EXPECT THERE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN PROBABLY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IS EACH ONE OF THESE WILL BE CONSIDERED ON THEIR OWN MERITS FOR EXAMPLE THE ARE INDEED CREDIT. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SO THAT THAT SO IT'S REALLY CLEAR I THINK WAS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN OR AT SOME POINT WE DID A TAX CREDIT FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS. AND WE SAIDOKAY WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU THIS TAX CREDIT BUT YOU GOTTA COME BACK IT'S GOING TO SUNSET. UNLESS YOU COME BACK AND SHOW US WHY. THIS HAS BEEN A BENEFIT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE YOUR CASE WELL NOT ONLY DID THEY MAKE THEIR CASE THEY MADE THEIR CASE SO WELL THAT WE DOUBLE THE TAX CREDIT. BECAUSE OF THAT WHAT WHAT WAS ESTABLISHED TO BE THE BENEFIT UP FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE GAVE IT A TAX CREDIT WE GOT SIX DOLLARS BACKERS SOME NUMBER. AND AND I THINK THAT AND NOW WITH EVERY TAX CREDIT WE DO FROM I THINK TWENTY FOURTEEN ON WE REQUIRE THAT SAME PROCESS FOR THOSE IT HAPPENED BEFORE THAT WE HAVE NO PROCESS. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO. IS TO IS BASICALLY TURNED US SET ASIDE THE CURTAIN ON THESE TAX HAD TO GIVE ANY KIND OF ACCOUNTING -- COMMENDATION OR ANALYSIS SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THE LAST THE DISNEY DID A AN EVENT HERE LOCALLY AND WE'RE ALL SITTING THERE WAITING FOR THE MOVIE TO START NAY WANT TO TELL US. WHAT A GREAT TAX CREDIT THIS IS THEY COULDN'T HELP THEMSELVES BUT TO PROVIDE US WITH THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE IF THE DATA IS THERE? THOSE TAX CREDITS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE [inaudible] MISTER CURRY. THANK YOU ARE YOU KNOW I'M I'M AT A SUB HERE TODAY FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS BUT I'M GLAD I'M HERE FOR THIS HEARING BECAUSE THIS IS A BILL THAT I I HEARD. FROM FROM -- BEFORE YOU TOOK IT ON FROM THE PEOPLE IN THE EDUCATION GROUP BUT I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAX POLICY BOWS ONE TALK FOR A BRIEF SECOND ABOUT. SCHOOLS AND I HAD THE PLEASURE OF A YEAR OF HEALTH RECONCILING THE BUDGET FOR OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND ALWAYS SAY THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE'VE INCREASE SCHOOL FUNDING IN A LAST ROUGHLY FIVE YEARS BY 50%. AND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF NEW MONEY GOING TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE BAD NEWS AS WE KNOW WE'RE STILL -- FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION AND AND THAT THEN WHY ARE WE HERE WHY IS IT AN ISSUE BECAUSE OF THIS BECAUSE WE DO SPEND A LOT TIME -- LOOKING FORWARD BUT NOT AS MUCH TIME LOOKING BACK AND THAT'S OUR THAT'S INDICTMENT FRANKLY OUR BUDGET PROCESS TO BUT ALSO THESE THESE TAX POLICY. ISSUES AND I I I DO I KNOW I THINK IT WAS NOT ONLY THIS COMMITTEE BUT I THINK OUR CENTER LET NO IN YOUR HOUSE WOULD SET THIS POLICY. LOOKING GOING FORWARD LIKE THE HOLLYWOOD TAX CREDIT. AND YOU KNOW WE WE HAVEN'T GONE BACK AND IT'S NOT JUST TO GOTCHA BUT SEE WHICH ONES ARE WORKING AND I THINK. OUR VOTERS PROBABLY THINK THEY WERE DOING THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT'S THE SAD TRUTH HERE IS THEY BUY THANK. WHAT YOU HAVEN'T GONE BACK A LOOK TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING? AND WHY IT MATTERS IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW. PARENTS ARE SEEING THAT THE DIP IN THEIR POCKETS TO PAY. FOR THE ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS AT THEIR SCHOOL WITH MUSIC AND SPORTS AND ARTS -- AND CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS I WOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY WE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS AS WELL AND SO -- YOU KNOW THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY FOR GOOD GOVERNMENT IT REALLY MATTERS TO THE FUTURE. OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND BECAUSE WE CAN'T KEEP LOOKING FOR NEW TAXES WE SPY LOOK AT THE ONES THE TAX -- TAX BREAKS WE HAVE UNDER THE CURRENT -- YES STATE POLICY AND SEE WHICH ONES ARE REALLY EFFECTIVE SO I I'D I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I'M GLAD I GOT TO GO ON THIS TODAY AND FLOOR. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MR GREY. WHY PROMISED YOU CENTER THAT KEEP AN OPEN MIND I DID? THAT I LISTENED ALTHOUGH I'M NOT CONVINCED -- YEAH I BEGAN MY TIME IN THE ASSEMBLY CHAIRPERSON OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT. COMMITTEE I KNOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE MANY OF US ARE. AND REGULARLY WE PUT IT ON IT'S NOT THE IN AN ANNUAL BASIS THE COMMITTEE ACTUALLY. SENDS US A BOOKLET WITH RECOMMENDATIONS. I SEE YOU HAVE IT I HAVE A AND I WOULD. LOOK BACK AT ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO HOW MANY WE'VE IMPLEMENTED. THE ANSWER IS VERY FEW. SO THE NOTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET ANOTHER. COMMITTEE OR ANOTHER SOME OTHER FOLKS TO GET US SOME OBJECTIVE DATA. THAT SOMEHOW GONNA CHANGE OUR MINDS -- IS LOOP SORT OF WE TALK ABOUT CAPACITY RIGHT. WITH THE LA -- DOESN'T HAVE CAPACITY THE BUDGET CHAIRMAN. DOESN'T HAVE CAPACITY THE REV AND TAX COMMITTEE WHERE WE MAKE REVENUE TAX POLICY DOES NOT OF CAPACITY BUT THIS NEW COMMISSION COMMITTEE OF FEW FOLKS IS GOING TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS JOB THAT NONE OF US. COLLECTIVELY -- COULD DO BEFORE THEM THAT'S AN ABSURD NOTION -- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE IS HONESTY IN IN IN POLICY MAKING POLITICS AND IT'S HARD TO FIND? ON YOUR I JUST INTRODUCED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. TO A CALTRAIN HYDRO'S ROOM WONDERED. NOW WE CAN GET A THOUSAND SCIENTISTS IN THE ROOM AND THEY WOULD ALL AGREE THAT TURNED OVER ENERGY THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY THIS COMMITTEE -- BOATS -- IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME THAT TO MY COLLEGE IN THE BAY AREA LIKE THE RD TAX CREDIT. I'M SHOCKED -- YOUR THAT THE THESE THINGS REQUIRE ADVOCACY AND THE INFORMATION IS READILY AVAILABLE NOW IN THE PUBLIC AND THEIR OPPOSING SIDES OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON EACH ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE COMMITTEES AND THE IRONY OF SITTING IN THE REVAN TALKED TO ME AND SAID ASSEMBLY AND SAY WE GOT A PART. ON THIS POLICY OF WHAT OUR TAX EXPENDITURES ARE IS ABSURD. SO AFTER LISTEN TO THE BAD I LIVE CLOSE THE DOOR NO THEN -- THEN THE YES BUT I'M STILL GOING TO ABSTAINED BECAUSE AGAIN I THINK -- THE UNDERLYING PREMISE THAT YOU'RE APPROACHING THIS WITH THE SOMETHING THAT I RESPECT AND AND AGREE WITH YOUR INTENTIONS ON I JUST. SIGNIFICANTLY SERIOUSLY DISAGREE WITH THE APPROACH AS LAID OUT THIS BILL. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT -- WITH PART OF THIS BILL IS BASED UPON THE TWENTY FIFTEEN LA -- TWENTY SIXTEEN LA -- SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS THE AUDITOR EXCUSE ME THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS SO. I KNOW THE WHEELS OF POLICY MOVES SLOWLY. OUR BLOOD WE REALLY ARE AT THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE TAKEN THAT REPORTS SERIOUSLY AND I SERVED ON J. LIKE FOR SIX YEARS IN THE ASSEMBLY SO I I APPRECIATE THE WORK IT DOES. AT WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND WHAT WE'VE CALLED UPON IS THE EXPERTISE. OF NOT ONLY THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BUT ALL OF THE VARIOUS AGENCIES THAT WILL THEN BE TAKING IN TRYING TO ANALYZE. THAT INFORMATION AND SO I THINK THAT THAT BECOMES -- THE FOCUS AND YOU KNOW. I DON'T SURE -- GOSH I HOPE I DON'T SURE THAT. THAT SENSE OF KIND OF CYNICISM HOW HER SYSTEM WHEN I MEAN IT'S NOT PERFECT BY ANY MEANS BUT I DO THINK THAT -- WE AIR THIS IN PUBLIC WE MAKE EVALUATIONS EVERYBODY MAKES THEIR BEST CASE. ARE AND THEN WE DECIDE AS A BODY. WHAT TAX BREAKS WERE GONNA GIVE WE DECIDE WHETHER WE WANT THAT MONEY TO INSTEAD TO GO INTO EDUCATION -- AS IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY POINTED OUT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY HERE THAT'S BEEN LEFT ON THE TABLE -- AND WE IS A BODY GET TO DECIDE WHETHER AS A POLICY THAT'S A GOOD THING OR BAD THING SO SO I LOOK AT THIS -- AS A LITTLE MORE OF A PROACTIVE PROCESS BUT I UNDERSTAND IF I KEEP TALKING I'M GONNA GET YOU TO KNOW SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING FURTHER. SO IS THAT YOUR CLOTHES THAT'LL BE MY CLOTHES ALL RIGHT. THE CHAIR IS GOING TO BE -- GONE FOR A WHILE IN THE VICE CHAIR IS PROBABLY GOING PERMANENTLY.
