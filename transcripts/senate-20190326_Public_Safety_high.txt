UNTIL WE HAVE OUR OTHER MEMBERS TO ESTABLISH OUR QUORUM -- WE HAVE SOME OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAD SPEAKING MAKING ENGAGEMENTS THIS MORNING BUT THEY WILL BE HERE SOON AS THEY HAVE COMPLETED THOSE. SO WEIRD. WE ARE GOING IN FILE ORDER WE DON'T HAVE ANY CHANGES TO THE AGENDA -- AND WE HAVE THREE ITEMS ON CONSENT. AND WE ARE GOING TO START WITH SB. TWENTY TWO SENATOR LEYVA. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR. SENATE BILL TWENTY TWO BUILT UPON THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT YOU MADAM CHAIR LET'S SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE PROMPT TESTING OF RAPE KITS OR AS YOU TOLD US LAST TIME SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS WE REMEMBER. AS YOU MAY REMEMBER GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED SB FOURTEEN FORTY NINE LAST YEAR. BUT I KNOW THAT WE ALL REMAIN COMMITTED TO MAKE THE PROPER TESTING OF GREAT KIDS A REALITY HENCE WHY I'M BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH THIS RE INTRODUCTION. THOUGH THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT A SIMPLE AUDIT OF EXISTING RAPE KITS WAS ENOUGH I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE SINCE THE BUT IT DOES NOTHING TO ADVANCE AS CLOSER. TO ENSURING JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS THE CORE OF SB TWENTY TWO IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE BUT IT WILL HELP HOW IT WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF VICTIMS. AND HELP REQUEST BEHIND BARS. THIS MEASURE SIMPLY CHANGES ONE WORD IN EXISTING LAW BYSAYING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND FORENSIC LABORATORIES SHALL FOLLOW INSTEAD OF SHOULD FOLLOW AS IT CURRENTLY STATES LISTED TIME FRAMES FOR SUBMITTING AND ANALYZING RAPE KIT EVIDENCE. MEMBERS MEMBER MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED SB EIGHT THIRTEEN WHICH ELIMINATED THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON RATE. THOUGH THAT WAS CERTAINLY A HUGE VICTORY THE ROAD TO JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT WILL BE INCOMPLETE IF THE RAPE KITS ARE NEVER TESTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. ALL RAPE VICTIMS DESERVE TO HAVE THE RAPE KITS TESTED WITHIN THE SPECIFIED TIME FRAME WHICH CAN IN TURN HELP TO ENSURE JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS. IDENTIFY SERIAL PERPETRATORS AND EVEN EXONERATE THE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. AS WE ALL KNOW RAPE IS ONE OF THE MOST TRAUMATIZING THINGS THAT CAN HELP TO HAPPEN TO SOMEONE. AND THEN AFTERWARDS WHEN YOU SUBMIT YOURSELF TO HAVING A SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT A RAPE KIT DONE WHICH TAKES MANY MANY HOURS AND O THINK THAT THAT IS NEVER TESTED AND TO THINK THAT THAT IS SITTING ON A SHELF SOMEPLACE. IS JUST INEXCUSABLE. I'D LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE WHICH SAID THAT HE THOUGHT WE SHOULD DO THE ODD AT FIRST. AND THEN WE WOULD GO FROM THERE. UNFORTUNATELY I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE I THINK HE MISSED THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE BILL WHICH WAS TO MAKE SURE WE NEVER HAVE A BACKLOG OF RAPE KITS AGAIN. SO I HOPE GOOD MOVING FORWARD THIS GETS TO OUR NEW GOVERNOR AND HE SIGNS IT INTO LAW. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I HAVE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY AND AMANDA STEVENS OF THE JOYFUL HEART FOUNDATION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. A GOOD MORNING. I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE AGAIN IN FRONT OF THE SENATOR SKINNER AND THE COMMITTEE -- AS SENATOR SKINNER KNOWS IN THE COMMITTEE KNOWS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW. ABOUT -- TRYING TO ENSURING THAT ALL SEXUAL SOCKETS ARE TESTED. OF A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHEN SENATOR SKINNER WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY SHE LED YOU LED THE EFFORT TO HAVE THEM TESTED IN THE COMPROMISE WAS SHALL AS OPPOSED TO SHOULD. AND SINCE THAT TIME WE STILL KNOW THAT KIDS ARE NOT BEING TESTED. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT -- WE DO KNOW ALSO THAT THROUGH A VOTE. ALMOST AN INCOMPLETE BECAUSE THE FAILURE OF SOME OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO RESPOND TO THE SURVEY BY JOYFUL HEART. THAT THERE ARE STILL KIDS ARE SITTING IN EVIDENCE ROOMS THAT ARE NOT BEING SUBMITTED. IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT CALIFORNIA MAKE THIS ISSUE AND THESE CRIMES A PRIORITY AND WE IT SENATOR KNOWS THAT IN MY OWN COUNTY. SEVERAL YEARS BACK WE IDENTIFIED NINETEEN HUNDRED KIDS THAT WERE UNTESTED THAT WENT BACK MANY YEARS WE HAVE NO BACKLOG IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND WE'VE CLEARED THAT UP. A NUMBER OF YEARS BACK BUT I MILITIA I AM -- BEING MILITANT ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT ALL KIDS GO TO THE CRIME LAB FOR TESTING AND AS A RESULT WE'RE ABLE TO SELL MORE CASES NOT JUST. FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CASE WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BUT ALSO TO LINK SERIAL RAPIST TO OTHER CASES. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT BENEFITS OF THE FORENSIC EVIDENCE OF SO FOR LL THOSE REASONS THAT IT THE TIME IS CALM. AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL A AS A SPONSOR IN ALSO URGING AYE VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE FIRST THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME SENATOR SKINNER CENTER MORLOCK. FOR TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT TESTING RIGHT GETS IN CALIFORNIA. I'M AMANDA STEVENS A BOARD MEMBER OF THE JOYFUL HEART FOUNDATION AND RESIDENT OF THIS GREAT STATE. I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO THE CHAIR SENATOR SKINNER FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE TODAY. AND OF COURSE THANK YOU TO SENATOR LEYVA AND HER STAFF FOR THEIR FEAR SUPPORT OF SURVIVORS. JOYFUL HEART WAS FOUNDED BY LAW AND ORDER ACTICIN ADVOCATE MARCIA HARGETT KAY AND IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF SENATE BILL TWENTY TWO WHICH REQUIRE TESTING OF ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS. CONNECTED TO REPORT A CRIME. IT WILL ALSO EXPAND ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS AND MAKE CALIFORNIA A SAFER. DNA EVIDENCE CONTAINED IN SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS IS A POWERFUL TOOL TO SOLVE AND PREVENT CRIME. WHEN TESTED IT CAN IDENTIFY UNKNOWN OFFENDERS AND LINK CRIMES TOGETHER? TESTING IN DETROIT OF TEN THOUSAND RAPE KITS HAS UNCOVERED MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED SERIAL RAPIST WHO HAVE COMMITTED ALL KINDS OF CRIMES IN FORTY OTHER STATES AND DC. HERE IN CALIFORNIA KEITH ASBURY JUNIOR OF ANTIOCH SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AT LEAST FIVE WOMEN OVER NINE YEARS EVENTUALLY MURDERING ONE OF HIS VICTIMS. ACCORDING TO PROCTOR PROSECUTORS ASBURY KIDNAPPED AND RAPED TWO YOUNG WOMEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD AND A NINETEEN YEAR OLD. THE SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS COLLECTED FROM THESE VICTIMS SAT UNTESTED FOR YEARS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HE ATTEMPTED RAPE OF A FORTY SIX OLD WOMAN AND A FEW WEEKS LATER BURGLARIZED HOME RAPING AND MURDERING A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD STUDENT. SEVERAL OF THESE CRIMES COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED WITH A TIMELY TESTING OF A SINGLE SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THANKS TO DL MALLEY FOR TESTING THE CATS IN THESE CASES. I COULD READ HEADLINES LIKE DETROIT AND THE ASBURY CASE FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR HOURS. CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW SAYS LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD SEND IDS FOR TESTING. THIS WAS A WELL INTENTIONED LOG BUT IT JUST ISN'T WORKING JOYFUL HEARTS ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT HAS ISSUED OPEN RECORDS REQUESTS TO EIGHT JURISDICTIONS. AND FOUND THAT SIX OUT OF THE EIGHT ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE LAW OR HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW MANY KIDS THEY ARE RECEIVING. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. BY PASSING SB TWENTY TWO AND CHANGING THE SHOULD TO A SHALL AND TESTING ALL SXUAL ASSAULT KITS CALIFORNIA WILL TAKE DANGEROUS VIOLENT OFFENDERS OFF THE STREET. IT WILL ALSO DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO SURVIVORS TO HELP THEM FIND A PATH TO HEALING AND JUSTICE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOU TO PASS THIS MUCH NEEDED LEGISLATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO BE OF OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JUST COME UP TO THE MIKE AND MY MANAGER RYNE SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANKS. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT ANY OTHERS. DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I JUST THOUGHT LESLIE CALDWELL PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE HAD WITHDRAWN OUR OPPOSITION I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE KNOWS PRE SHEET THAT. ALRIGHT SO SEEING NO OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- I WILL I MAKE A COMMENT NO SEE IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- OUR LANGUAGE IS A VERY POWERFUL THING AND WHILE THE WORD K&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; IS REFERRED. TO THINGS LIKE TOOL KIT AND SHAVING KITIT DOES TEND TO REFER MORE COMMONLY TWO ITEMS ASSOCIATED WITH FEMALES SEWING KIT MAKE UP KITS THINGS LIKE THAT [inaudible] AND WELL WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THE DATA SHOWS THAT THAT. THESE -- THAT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE IS NOT TESTED IS BECAUSE IT IS COMMONLY. A FEMALE WHO HAS EXPERIENCE THE ASSAULT [inaudible] AND UNFORTUNATELY. WHETHER IT'S IMPLICIT BIAS WHO KNOWS. THE BY I SHOULD SAY WHO KNOWS THERE IS A VERY STE RESEARCH BUT I CAN ASIDE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME. THESE CRIMES ARE NOT TAKEN AS SERIOUSLY SO THAT'S THE EVIDENCE IS NOT PUT INTO THE DNA DATABASE AND WE DON'T GET THE CRIMES RESOLVE. THE FACT IS IS THAT THERE'S A VERY LARGE PERCENT OF WOMEN STILL. MEN AND WOMEN BUT WHO DO NOT REPORT THEIR SEXUAL ASSAULTS. AND OF COURSE IF YOU EVER READ ABOUT. FOLKS LIKE THE WOMAN IN SAN FRANCISCO WHO -- WENT TO THE TROUBLE OF GETTING HER WHOLE MEDICAL EXAMINATION AND HER EVIDENCE. SUBMITTED AND THEN IT WAS NEVER SUBMITTED TO THE IT WAS NEVER TESTED. AND SHE KEPT RETURNING TO THE POLICE OFFICE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND WOULD NOT GET ANY ANSWER. I MEAN THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE THERE'S ALREADY SHAME -- FOR IT MEETING THAT YOU WERE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THERE'S ALREADY SHAME TO EVEN REPORT YOUR CRIME. SO WHY WOULD YOU REPORT IF YOU THINK THERE IT I WILL THE LAN PERSONS NOT GONNA TAKE IT SERIOUSLY SO. I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THE PRIMARY REASON IT DIDN'T HAVE. SHOULD -- SHOT WHATEVER. SHALL. USE ME IN MY ORIGINAL BILLS BECAUSE AT THE TIME AND I WAS CARRYING THE BILL WE HAD SHE LOST I THINK WE HAD JUST ENDED OUR DEFICITS ANYWAY IT WAS WE KNEW THAT IT WOULDN'T GET THROUGH A PROPS. SO BUT WE'RE IN BETTER SHAPE NOW SO I APPRECIATE THAT BROUGHT IT FORWARD AND I HOPE WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE. EVERY SIX SINGLE SEXUAL ASSAULT IS REPORTED. ALL EVIDENCE IS TESTED. AND WE CAN ANDERSON RESOLVE THE CRIMES. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. WE THIS IS WE DON'T A QUORUM YET SO. WE'LL JUST KEEP IT TO LOOK AT PORN. RIGHT IN THERE WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION THAT OKAY SO -- WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING AN WILL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE FORGET OUR CAR IF I MAY CLOSE YES OF START THAT'S OKAY. I I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I AGREE WHOLE HEARTEDLY WE ALL AGREE WHOLE WHOLE HEARTEDLY AND EVERYTHING IN ITS TIME THE WORK THAT YOU DID WHEN YOU DID IT WAS IN ITS TIME AND NOW WE THINK IT'S TIME TO CHANGE IT TO SHALL. AND PUT IT INTO THIS SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS AND WHEN APPROPRIATE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE GREAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST. DONE SO THAT WE DO KNOW THERE ARE STILL. AND THEY'RE STILL EVIDENCE. ON THE SHELVES THAT HAS NOT BEEN BECAUSE RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

SO WILL HOLD OFF FOR A MOMENT UNTIL WE GET A PRESENTER HELLO [inaudible] FOR CENTER TANK THANK -- SB THIRTY FIVE PLEASE PRESENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. DESPITE YEARS A COMMENDABLE EFFORTS TO COMBAT SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING THIS IS STILL A CRIME IN CALIFORNIA -- HUMAN TRAFFICKING REMAINS WIDESPREAD ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING RESOURCE CENTER DURING THE PERIOD. TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAS CONSISTENTLY RANKED AT THE TOP OF ITS HOTLINE CALLS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE HOT WHEN WAS THE NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND CALLS IN CALIFORNIA. RESULT IN JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES REPORTED. THAT NUMBER REPRESENTS NEARLY CASES SINCE. TWENTY TWELVE SADLY MANY OF THESE VICTIMS CYCLE THROUGH THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND ADDS HOMELESSNESS GROWS. CALIFORNIA BECOMES MORE VULNERABLE TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING. HUMAN TRAFFICKING IMPACTS ALL WALKS OF LIFE BUT YOUNG GIRLS ARE OFTEN THE TARGETS OF TRAFFICKERS. JUST LAST WEEK A MAN WAS ARRESTED IN SANTA ANA ON ALLEGATIONS OF THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING THREE MINERS. THEY FOUND HIM IN A HOTEL WITH TWO GIRLS AGES THIRTEEN AND FIFTEEN LAST YEAR THE ORANGE COUNTY HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE. HELP FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS AND MORE THAN 25% OF THOSE WERE MINORS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOR CALIFORNIA ENACTED ITS FIRST. ANTI TRAFFICKING LAW WHICH ESTABLISHED THE CALIFORNIA LINES COMBAT TRAFFICKING AND SLAVERY. WHICH IS CALIFORNIA ACTS TASK FORCE IS TWO THOUSAND FIVE REPORT LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR COORDINATED COLLABORATIVE RESPONSE TO COMBATTING SEX. AND LABOR TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA.

RECALIBRATE THE STATE'S HUMAN TRAFFICKING SUPPRESSION STRATEGY AS WELL AS MEASURE THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE GROWING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. THERE IS MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. THE TASK FORCE OUTLINED IN THIS BILL LARGELY MIRRORS THE ONE THAT CAME BEFORE IT BUT MAKE SOME IMPORTANT CHANGES. IN PARTICULAR THE TASK FORCE WILL LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR PREVALENCE STUDY FOR CALIFORNIA. THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH DATA FOR US TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THIS ISSUE. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE AT A MORE DETAILED LEVEL THE TIME IS RIGHT TO RECONVENE THESE LEADERS AND REALIGN OUR HUMAN TRAFFICKING SUPPRESSION STRATEGY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY IN WOULD NEED TO EXPAND ON WHAT THIS TASK FORCES ABOUT IS STEPHANIE RICHARD. REPRESENTING THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING. WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS ISSUE FOR YEARS INCLUDING PARTICIPATION IN THE LAST STATE TASK FORCE? THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. I'M IN A ESTABLISH QUORUM POLICY SO IF YOU'RE POSSIBLE FOR A MOMENT AND SECRETARY CAN YOU CALL THE ROLL SKINNER. I'M HERE MOORLACH BRADFORD. JACKSON MITCHELL HERE BROWN'S MORRELL WIENER. OKAY DON'T WORRY DON'T WORRY -- WE ARE ALSO OING TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO ADOPT OUR RULES BEFORE WE PROCEED. GREAT SAYS THEIR SECOND NO WE DON'T NEED A SECOND POLICY I'M STILL. LIKE YOU KNOW.

AND I I APPRECIATE AND THE OTHER MEMBERS WHO MIGHT HAVE NINE THIRTY I HAD NINE THREE ON MY CALENDAR FILL IN THE DAY YESTERDAY -- ALL RIGHT SO. WITNESS YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC AGAIN MY NAME IS STEPHANIE RICHARD I'M THE POLICY LEGAL SERVICES DIRECTOR OF THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING COMMONLY KNOWN AS CAST. CATS IS THE FIRST SERVICE BRIGHTER IN THE UNITED STATES IS CLOSELY SERVING SURVIVORS OF MODERN SLAVERY WE OFFER COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES INCLUDING INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT LEGAL AND SHELTER WE OFFER DIRECT SERVICES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA AND OPERATE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE THAT'S POSTED ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LAST YEAR WE SERVED OVER A THOUSAND SURVIVORS OF SEX AND LABOR TRAFFICKING AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. CAST SPEAKING TODAY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AS A SPONSOR OF SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH WOULD RECONVENE THE CALIFORNIA LINES TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING AND SLAVERY. ACTS TASK FORCE. HAVING WORKED ON ANTI TRAFFICKING POLICIES AND SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA FOR ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS I'VE PERSONALLY BEEN A MEMBER. OF THE ALL THE PREVIOUS TASK FORCES AND I HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN THAT THERE'S NO OTHER PRO CHOICE THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO BRING TOGETHER THE EXPERTISE NEEDED TO REALLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE COMPREHENSIVELY INCLUDING LOOKING AT THE ISSUES OF SEX AND LABOR TRAFFICKING IMPACTING MEN. WOMEN AND CHILDREN STATEWIDE IN THE PAST TO SEIZE TASK FORCES PROVIDE INVALUABLE INFORMATION FOR THE STATE AND WHAT HAS BEEN WORKING AND WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE BASED ON EXPERT AGENCY INPUT. THE TASK FORCE IN THE PAST HAS BEEN CONTRIVED OF TWENTY TWO APPOINTED MEMBERS AND WE RECOMMEND THE SAME FORMAT AND STRUCTURE. THAT HAS WORKED CONSISTENTLY IN THE PAST WITH THE ADDITION OF SIX NEW MEMBERS TWO OF THE NEW MEMBERS INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE HOMELESS INITIATIVE BECAUSE OF THE RECENT HOMELESS FOR EXAMPLE. BECAUSE OF THE RECENT HOMELESS CON LA WE FOUND THAT FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS OF THE FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS HOMELESS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ITSELF IDENTIFIED AS VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING. ALMOST ONE IN TEN WE FURTHER RECOMMEND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SURVIVORS APPOINTED THE TASK FORCE FROM ONE TO THREE GIVEN THE DIVERSE FORMS OF TRAFFICKING. THAT THE TASK FORCE REVIEWS AND LOOKS INTO ONE SURVIVOR APPOINTMENT JUST ISN'T ENOUGH FOR THE SAME REASON WE RECOMMEND INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SERVICE WRITERS APPOINTED THE TASK FORCE SO YOU DO HAVE THAT WIDE RE OF EXPERTISE. IN THE DIFFERENT SUB CATEGORIES OF TRAFFICKING WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TASK FORCE DOES NEED TO BE COMPRISED OF THIS DIVERSE GROUP OF MEMBERS TO TRULY BRING TOGETHER. AND TO THE TABLE A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH HUMAN TRAFFICKING CANNOT JUST HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE LANDS BUT TO PREVENT EARLY IDENTIFY AND ULTIMATELY AND THIS GRAVE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE IN OUR STATE. WE MUST BE ABLE TO COORDINATE THIS DIVERSE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS OF STATE PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT ACTORS -- AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT AB ARE SB THREE THIRTY FIVE REQUIRES. NOW SB THIRTY FIVE ALSO REQUIRES THE TASK FORCE PRODUCE THREE REPORTS TO ARE EXPECTED TO BE QUITE SHORT AND FOCUS ON VERY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FROM TASK FORCE MEMBERS ON TWO AREAS. BUT COST AND DATA COLLECTED NEEDED FOR THE PREVALENCE STUDY TO LOOK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE SECOND IS HOW TO BEST EVALUATE THE TWENTY ONE SERVICE PROVIDERS RECEIVING NEW STATE MONEY AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THE DATA THEY SHOULD BE COLLECTING. THESE REPORTS ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE ONE MEETING OF INPUT EACH FROM THIS GROUP OF EXPERTS AND THEREFORE HAVE EARLIER REPORT OUT. A FINAL REPORT ME YEARS. THE REPORTS WE'VE ALREADY SEEN PRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND THEN AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND THE TIMELINE FOR THE REPORT TO BE PRODUCES THE SAME AS IT'S BEEN IN THE PAST -- CAST BASED ON A TWENTY YEARS OF ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE OUR INTERESTS ARRIVE AS A TRAFFICKING HERE IN OUR STATE BELIEVES THE TIMING IS RIGHT TO RECONVENE THE STATE WHITE. FORCE AND ASK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTY FIVE RIGHT -- ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

MMHM -- WE NOW HAVE QUORUM SO WE CAN -- SORRY WE ALREADY HAVE A POLICIES POLITICS WE DID ROLL CALL EVEN -- I CAN ENTERTAIN A MOTION [inaudible] ON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE TO SERVE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE THANK YOU EXCELLENT. SO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL -- LET'S DO ROLL CALL. MOTION IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE MORE LOCK. WELL LIKE I BRADFORD BRADFORD AYE JACKSON MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MOREAU WELL I WIENER. ARE WE THE BILL. WILL HOLD IT OPEN WHETHER OTHER MEMBERS COME. LOOKING GOOD AND WE WILL THANK YOU WILL NOW GO TO OUR NEXT BILL THANKS TO THE MONITOR HERTZBERG. AND THAT'S SB. THIRTY SIX THANK YOU AMEND SHERRIN MEMBERS THIS MEASURE IS. THE JOINT AUTHORED BY SENATOR MITCHELL RESEARCH ON THIS COMMITTEE SO TO THE EXTENT -- YOU LIKE TO PARTICIPATE THIS IS OF SOMETHING THAT SHE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN FOR MANY YEARS. AND WITH RESPECT TO LEGISLATION LAST YEAR AS WELL. RECOGNIZE THAT THE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM NEW JERSEY TO TEXAS TO ALASKA. THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT. MOVEMENT TO FOCUS ON REFORMING THE PRE TRIAL JUSTICE SYSTEM PRE TRIAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS THAT. PERIOD OF TIME WHERE YOU'RE INNOCENT YOU'RE PROVEN GUILTY AND WERE YOU ARRESTED WHEN THE HANDCUFFS ARE PUT ON UP UNTIL THE TIME WHEN YOU ACTUALLY ARE DETERMINED BY A JURY. TO IT WHETHER YOU'RE GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY WHAT DO YOU DO HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT PERIOD OF TIME. AND IT'S IT IT IT PROVES TO BE SOMETHING THAT -- TREATS PEOPLE BASED UPON THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY GREW UP. IN VERY DIFFERENT MEANS WE'VE DEALT LAST YEARS YOU KNOW -- WITH THE BAIL ISSUE. ON IN OTHER ISSUES OF PRE TRIAL -- BUT JUSTICE. AND SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY IS A BILL THAT LOOKS AT THESE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT Là WORKING GROUP -- IN A STUDY GROUP IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT RECOMMENDED ABOLISHING MONEY BAIL AND REPLACING IT WITH VALIDATED RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS. TURNS OUT THAT. FORTY NINE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS WAS A RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL. IT IS SOMETHING THAT -- IS SIS THE JUDGE IN DETERMINING FLIGHT RISKS AND PUBLIC SAFETY RISKS BY ANSWER ASKING A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS LOOKING INTO THE BACKGROUND OF THE PERSON BEING CHARGED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TREATED JUSTLY. TURNS OUT THAT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE STUDY BY THE PRE TRIAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE INDICATED ONLY TWO POINT 9% OF CALIFORNIANS. LIVE IN A COUNTY THAT USES A VALIDATED RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL. AND SO WHAT THIS WHAT THIS BILL DOES FOR THE FORTY NINE COUNTIES THAT CURRENTLY HAVE THESE TOOLS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR THESE TOOLS ARE IN FACT. VALIDATED. ON THE CUT THESE TOOLS COME IN MANY SIZES AND SHAPES SUMMER PRODUCED BY FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS SUMMER BY CHARITABLE. ORGANIZATIONS. AND THEY THEY MANY OF THEM DON'T COVER THE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR EFFECTIVELY ASSESSING RISK. SAFEGUARDS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR TWO REASONS MEMBERS ONE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS LACK OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY NECESSARY FOR AN HONEST EVALUATION. ELIMINATION OF DISPARATE INCOME OUTCOMES EXCUSE ME BASED UPON RACE ECONOMIC STATUS AMONG OTHER FACTORS AND SECONDLY. TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY THE TOOLS NEED TO GO THROUGH WHAT IS CALLED THE VALIDATION PROCESS OUR REGULAR CALIBRATION. OF THEIR PREDICTABLE CUP OF PREDICTIVE CAPACITY USING LOCALIZE DATA. AND SO WITH THIS BILL WE ARE PUTTING ON WE WERE NOT REQUIRING COUNTIES TO USE VALIDATED THE THESE TOOLS BUT ONCE THEY USE THEM WERE BASICALLY PUTTING ON BUMPERS. YEAH EIGHT YOU'VE GOT IT TO THE BOWLING LANE IF YOU WILL WORDS ARE BALLS COULD MEAN UNNECESSARY DEPRIVING SOMEONE OF THEIR PERSONAL LIBERTY OR COMPROMISING PUBLIC SAFETY THIS BILL DOES THE FOLLOWING BY SETTING UP THREE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. ONE ANY COUNTY THAT USES IT A RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL MUST VALIDATE THAT TO ON A REGULAR BASIS EVERY SIX MONTHS. TO BOMB ANY TOOL USED IN CALIFORNIA MUST BE TRANSPARENT THAT MEANS THE COUNTIES NEED TO TELL THE PUBLIC EXACTLY HOW THE RISK. ASSESSMENT SCORES ARE BEING CALCULATED NOTHING WORSE THAN YOU HAVE A TOOL SOMEONE SAYS -- YOUR HIGH RISK WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY OR WHAT THE FACTORS ARE WHAT THEY CONSIDERED WHETHER COMMUNITIES OVER POLICE TO WHATEVER IT WAS. AND THREE COUNTIES DUE TO COLLECT AND RETAIN AND PUBLISH DATA ON THEIR PRE TRIAL RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS SO THAT THEY CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. SO THIS IS IT'S CERTAINLY GREW OUT OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS LONG DISCUSSION ON BAIL. ARM IN DEALING WITH THIS VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE OF MAKING SURE THAT WE ADMINISTER JUSTICE IN A FAIR AND UNBIASED WAY -- IN TREATING PEOPLE -- A APPROPRIATELY BEFORE JURY HAS MADE A DETERMINATION WITH THAT A GOOD WITNESSES WILL TESTIFY AND FAVORS MEASURE. ARE YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU FOR HAVING MADE A MY NAME IS TOM HOFFMAN I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SAFETY FOR FORTY FOUR YEARS. THIRTY ONE YEARS SO -- DIVIDED BETWEEN INGLEWOOD PD FOR ABOUT TWENTY WAS SACRAMENTO PD FOR ABOUT. ELEVEN I RETIRED AND THEN IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIX LIFE CHANGING EVENT. I WAS ASKED TO BECOME THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA DOLE PAROLE. WELL IT WAS LIFE CHANGING IN MANY WAYS -- MOST -- GRAPHICALLY THAT THERE IS SO MUCH OF SCIENCE RESEARCH AND DATA ANALYSIS AROUND THE CALIFORNIA. A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND OR INMATES AND PAROLEES SPECIFICALLY THAT I HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF PRIOR TO BEING THE PAROLE DIRECTOR. IN THE PROCESS OF EDUCATING MYSELF AROUND THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ROLE I WAS AND I WAS INTRODUCED TO THE CONCEPT OF A RISK ASSESSMENT. SOMETHING THAT I HAD NOT HAD EXPOSURE TO AS A POLICE CHIEF OR IN ANY OF THE PREVIOUS THIRTY ONE YEARS. THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED TO BE THE SOLE SOURCE OF A DECISION MAKING AN UNDERTAKING. A RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS ARE DESIGNED TO BE ABOUT 75% ACCURATE. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU AND I WERE TO MAKE A CLINICAL JUDGMENT OF SOMEBODY'S RESEARCH WILL HE OR SHE COME BACK WILL HE OR SHE COMMITTED AN OFFENSE. YOU'RE GOING TO BE RIGHT ABOUT HALF THE TIME. AND SO BY OVERLY IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS WITH A VALID A RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL WE IMPROVE OUR CAPACITY TO BE RIGHT BY ABOUT 25%. NOT PERFECT BUT CERTAINLY I THINK THIS MEETS A THRESHOLD AS ONE OF THE BIGGEST RESPONSIBILITY THE PUBLIC SAFETY LEADERS IN IS THAT IT IS TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO OUR PUBLIC. AND THOSE OF YOU WHO SERVE AS OUR LEADERS IN THE IN THE U. A POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT WE ARE TAKING EVERY REASONABLE STEP TO MITIGATE. THE RISKS THAT ARE DECISIONS MAKE TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR WE CAN RISK ASSESSMENT ACCOMPLISHES THAT -- IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO TO KNOW THAT THE THE AND MORE ROOMS ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF SB THIRTY SIX AS HAVING A TOOL IS ONE THING. THE VALIDATION PROCESS IS ENTIRELY ANOTHER AND AND AND IT VERY IMPORTANT BUT IN A NUTSHELL WHAT A VALIDATION PROCESS DOES IS IT'S IF YOU HAVE ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT YOU RATED OVER THE COURSE OF THREE YEARS OR WHATEVER TIME PERIOD. LET'S JUST SAY YOU RATED. A LOTS OF THEM AS LOW RISK. AND DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW RISK PEOPLE OF ARE COMMITTING CRIMES ARE NOT SHOWING UP -- FOR THE TRIAL THE TOOLS CAN BE ADJUSTED SO THAT THE THRESHOLD FOR THE RATINGS REFLECT THE REALITY THAT YOU'RE GETTING OUT OF THE TOOL AND HOW THE COMMUNITY YOU'RE SERVING. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN IN THE GROWTH OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM EFFORT WERE SOMEBODY'S STEPPING FORWARD AND AND A DEFINED GUIDELINES. OUTCOMES INFO AND IT PROCESS BY WHICH WE CAN HAVE SOME CONTINUITY AND CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE FOR A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WE HAVE IN OUR STATE. I HISTORICALLY HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE WE HAVE FIFTY A COUNTIES AND THEY DO THINGS IS RIGHTFULLY. OF THEIR OWN WAY BUT IN THE THE INSTANCE OF THIS THE APPLICATION OF THE SCIENCE IN THE RESEARCH IS IMPERATIVE AND I VERY MUCH ONCE IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTY SIX BECAUSE OF THAT. GOOD MORNING GOING BACK IS FOR ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. HELLO BAKER CENTERS BASED IN OAKLAND WE DO NATIONAL LOCAL AND STATE POLICY. TO HELP -- ADVANCE RACIAL ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND TO ENSURE DIGNITY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE ITS PRIMARY ROLE IS TO ENSURE THAT. ANYONE HO ANY COUNTY OR COURT THAT ELECTS TO USE THESE TOOLS. THAT WE HAVE A PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING BY A CEASE BY FEES BASED ON RACE GENDER. INCOME DISABILITY STATUS IT'S A DATA BILL IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD WE NEED TO KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE PATTERNS THAT ARE OBVIOUS AND CAN ONLY BE IDENTIFIED BY COLLECTION DATA. THAT SOME PEOPLE. ARE BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY AND THEREFORE THE TOOLS HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED -- MR HOPPER SOMEBODY JUST IN THERE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ELEVATORS TALK ABOUT ADJUSTING AND FOR RACIAL JUSTICE THANK YOU.

TO BE VALIDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT NO LESS FREQUENTLY THAN EVERY SIX MONTHS AND PROVIDES THAT A PRETRIAL. SERVICES AGENCY MAY COORDINATE WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO VALIDATE A PRE TRIAL RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL. HOW DO WE COME UP WITH SIX MONTHS THAT SEEMS? VERY FREE. WELL THERE IS DISCUSSION AMONG THE VARIOUS GROUPS TO FIGURE WHAT THAT ISN'T RELATED TO COSTS THE IDEA IS IS S TO JUST GATHER DATA AND CONTINUALLY JUST TO MAKE SURE AS ELLA BAKER. TESTIFIED TO GET THIS THING IS FARING JOSH AND HOW IT WORKS IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE KIND OF A BROAD SENSE FROM THE EXPERTS IN THE COMMUNITY BUT WE ARE STILL IN DISCUSSIONS TO SEE IF THERE SHOULD BE ADJUSTMENTS ON THAT NUMBER.

ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY BY THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL VAN ELLS OFFICIALLY THE DEADLIEST DRUG IN AMERICA. THIS UP TO FIFTY TIMES MORE POTENT THAN PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE HEROIN OFTEN MIXED INTO HEROIN AND OTHER DRUGS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF USERS. IS ALSO CHEAPER TO MAKE IT EASIER TO TRANSPORT THAN HEROIN THESE FACTORS COMBINED TO MAKE FAT NOW THE EMERGING GO TO DRUG FOR CARTELS AND THAT'S WHO THIS BILL IS ESSENTIALLY TARGETING. BECAUSE OF FAN KNOWS POTENCY OVERDOSES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE FATAL BECAUSE IT CAN SHUT DOWN THE LUNGS IN AND IN AS LITTLE AS TWO MINUTES SO VICTIMS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE RESCUED. THAN THOSE WHO OVERDOSED ON OTHER DRUGS IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FAT NAIL CAN BE DEADLY SIMPLY IF IT BECOMES AIRBORNE OR MAKES CONTACT WITH THE SKIN. POSING SIGNIFICANT DANGERS TO FIRST RESPODERS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO RESUSCITATE A VICTIM. SADLY WE ARE ALREADY SEEING DEATHS THIS YEAR BECAUSE MY PH&lt;c.cyan&gt; N<u> OVERDOSES ACROSS OUR</u>&lt;/c&gt; STATE. JANUARY SEVENTH IN FRESNO COUNTY ONE MAN DIED TWO OTHERS HOSPITALIZED AFTER SNORTING FAN MAIL THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS COCAINE JANUARY THIRTEENTH THEN SHOOK CHICO ONE PERSON DIED IN TWELVE WERE HOSPITALIZED AFTER OLD OVERDOSING ON A DRUG. SUSPECTED TO BE FOUND NOW STATE TRENCAVEL ODD FIT KNOWS PROLIFERATION EVEN THOUGH THE NUMBER OF DEATHS FROM OPIOID OVERDOSE AS FELL SLIGHTLY. FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEATHS RELATED TO FAT NAIL USE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE PEOPLE DIED FROM FAT NOW OVERDOSES AND TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTEEN WHICH IS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE EIGHTY ONE WHO DIED. ARE FROM THE DRUGS IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN THIS IS MY FOURTH YEAR ATTEMPTING THIS IMPORTANT BILL SO I WANT TO DISPEL SOME OF THE CRITICISMS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OR READ. SB ONE SIXTY ONE IN NO WAY IMPACT SENTENCES FOR END USERS THOSE USING ON MEDICAL FAT NOW ALSO FOR IS LEGITIMATE AND PRESCRIBE PURPOSE. THIS BILL IS NOT A WAR ON DRUGS STYLE CRIMINALIZATION OF LOW LEVEL DEALERS BUT INSTEAD CRACKS DOWN ON THE DRUG CARTELS AND HIGH LEVEL DRUG DEALERS. THAT ARE DISTRIBUTING AND TRAFFICKING AND SELLING MASS QUANTITIES OF THIS POISON. THE BILL WOULD ONLY GOING TO AFFECT FROM SOMEONE IS CAUGHT WITH A KILOGRAM OR MORE THAT'S ABOUT TWO AND A HALF. POUNDS ODD JUST ILLUSTRATE A KILOGRAM OF FAT NOW HAS A STREET VALUE OF ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS AND HAS THE POTENCY TO KILL UPWARDS OF FOUR MILLION PEOPLE OR ABOUT 10% OF OUR STATE'S POPULATION. IT ONLY TAKES POINT TWO FIVE MIL MIL. MILLIGRAMS TO TREAT OUR FOR ODD TINA REVOCATION AND CERTAINLY THAT'S WITH TERMINAL ILLNESSES. TO RECEIVE THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS. ANY INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE TO BE CAUGHT WITH OVER EIGHTY KILOGRAMS OF FAN NOW WHICH IS ENOUGH TO KILL. OUR THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE ABOUT THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES. SB ONE SIXTY ONE DOES NOT DETRACT FROM CALIFORNIA'S INCREASING INVESTMENT IN REHABILITATION SERVICES BUT COMPLEMENTED BY REDUCING THE ILLEGAL FAT NO TRADE IS THAT SOURCE AGAIN. THE HUGE DRUG CARTELS THAT BRING IN MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF THOSE THIS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY -- DISTRIBUTED OR MAKES THE END TO ARE THE CURRENT HEROIN AND COCAINE SOURCES. ARE WITH ME TODAY IS ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT SURE OF JEFF HALLECK WHO CAN ELABORATE ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HOUSE AND WHY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL. ARE IN THERE ON THE TOWN. TO ELIMINATE FAT NOW FROM ITS IMPORTATION INTO OUR COUNTRY MAY PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JEFF HELLO CAM ASSISTANT SHERIFF WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. I AM PLEASED TODAY TO REPRESENT ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL ONE SIXTY ONE WHICH INSURERS THOSE WHO POSSESS FAT NOW FOR PURPOSES OF DISTRIBUTION OR SALE WILL BE ADEQUATELY HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THIS LEGISLATION WILL MAKE THE PENALTIES FOR SUCH TYPE OF POSSESSION EQUIVALENT TO OTHER DANGEROUS NARCOTICS LIKE COCAINE AND HEROIN. IN MY CAPACITY IS ASSISTING SHARE FOR THE FIELD OPERATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS COMMAND WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT I OVERSEE ALL NARCOTICS TASK FORCE AND INVESTIGATIONS IN OUR JURISDICTION. THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE PREVALENCE OF FAT AND ALL. AS YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATION WAS PREVIOUSLY INTRODUCED EACH YEAR SINCE. TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS COMMITTEE SAW THE WISDOM OF THE BILL AND APPROVED UNANIMOUSLY. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY UNANIMOUS APPROVAL BY THE FULL SENATE. UNFORTUNATELY THAT LEGISLATION WAS NOT APPROVED BY THE ASSEMBLY. IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE THE BILL WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH FAN ALL HAVE GROWN. IN THE LAST DECADE STATES ON THE EAST COAST OF SEEN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS RELATED TO FANEUIL SKYROCKET. THE TREND SEEN ON THE EAST COAST NOW IS MADE ITS WAY TO THE WEST COAST HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE ILLICIT USE OF THE DRUG FENNEL. IN ORANGE COUNTY FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE SAW THREE HUNDRED AND 30% INCREASEIN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS THAT OCCURRED WITH FEDERAL PRESENT. FROM. TWENTY SIXTEEN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE AMOUNT OF A LISTED FENTON ALL ANALYZED BY THE ORANGE COUNTY CRIME LAB MORE THAN DOUBLED. ALARMINGLY IN ON THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT JURISDICTION FENTON ALL SEIZURE SKYROCKETED FROM LESS THAN ONE POUND TO MORE THAN FORTY FOUR POUNDS IN JUST TWO YEARS. A FATAL OVERDOSE OFFEND ALL CAN BE TWO MILLIGRAMS FOR A LITTLE BIT OF PERSPECTIVE THAT IS A SUGAR PACKET SIZED BAG OF FENNEL THE CAN CONTAIN FIVE HUNDRED LETHAL DOSES OF FAT AND ALL. THE FORTY FOUR POUNDS SEIZE BY THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CONTAINS MORE THAN TEN MILLION FATAL DOSES. ENOUGH AND ALSO OVERDOSE THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF ORANGE COUNTY THREE TIMES. IN ADDITION TO THE DANGERS THIS DRUG POSES TO USERS IT ALSO POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO FIRST RESPONDERS. FAT NOT CAN BE ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WHO KNOWINGLY OR UNKNOWINGLY COME IN CONTACT WITH THE DRUG COULD FACE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH RISKS. AS A RESULT IN THE LAST YEAR WE THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AT REVAMPS OUR PROTOCOL FOR HANDLING OF ALL NARCOTICS. SOME MAY QUESTION WHY WE CONTINUE TO STRONGLY PURSUE THE LEGISLATION DESPITE ITS CONTINUE TO FEED. WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND CONCERNS WITH INCREASED SENTENCING BUT ACCOUNTABILITY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE MULTI PRONGED APPROACH NEEDED TO ELIMINATE THE THREAT OF DRUGS. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON BOTH THE SUPPLY AND THE DEMAND IN ORANGE COUNTY WE'RE WORKING TO EDUCATE OUR YOUTH AND OUR PARENTS THERE ARE DRUG USE IS LIKE THESE PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY OUR COUNTIES WERE TO SAVE THE LIVES OF ADDICTS BY HAVING ALL DEPUTIES CARRYING NALOXONE OPIOID ANTAGONIST IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN ONE CST IMPLEMENTED A NO LOCKS ON PROGRAM ONLY THREE DOSES OF NALOXONE WERE DEPLOYED TO THREE INDIVIDUALS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE DOSES WERE USED ON THIRTY EIGHT SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS IN TWENTY NINETEEN IS TRACKING TO EXCEED ALL PREVIOUS YEARS COMBINED. AS WE ARE EMPLOYING NUMBER STRATEGIES WE WE NEED. NOW WE NEED THE FORCE OF THE LAW TO ASSIST US IN HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE THE PROFITEERS OF ADDICTION. THIS LEGISLATION IS NEEDED TO ASSIST LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FINALLY GETTING AHEAD OF THE ILLEGAL CELL OFFEND ALL BEFORE WE START SEEING THE HIGH LEVEL OF OVERDOSE WE TELL THESE BEING EXPERIENCED IN OTHER STATES. SENATE BILL ONE SIXTY ONE APPROPRIATELY TARGET STEELERS RATHER THAN USERS. IN MANY CASES DEALERS WILL LESS FAT AND ALL AND OTHER DRUGS PRIOR TO THE SALE UNBEKNOWNST TO THE DRUG AND YET END DRUG USER. CURRENT LAW PROVIDES IS BASED ON THE PENALTY STRUCTURE WHERE INCENTIVIZING FENTON ALL OVER HEROIN AND COCAINE EVEN THOUGH FAN ALL IS FAR MORE DANGEROUS. IN APPROVING SENATE BILL ONE SIXTY ONE AND PUTTING FAN ALL IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS HEROIN AND COCAINE WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE TO DRUG DEALERS THAT THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES IF THEY CHOOSE TO PEDDLE THIS DEADLY SUBSTANCE. I ASK YOU TODAY TO JOIN THE NUMEROUS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND VOTE IN FAVOR OF SB ONE SIXTY ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JOHNSON CLAIMED AFTER THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO HERE IN SUPPORT. JOHN LEVEL ASSOCIATION OF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. CALIFORNIA -- COLLEGE UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA NARCOTICS OFFICERS ASSOCIATION LA COUNTY PROFESSIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION ALL IN SUPPORT. BRENDAN UP ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING LUCIA MUCH LARA BE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT. RANGE FROM WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE CAN HAVE A TWO AT THE TABLE AND THEN THE OTHERS JUST AT THE MIKE. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE GOING BACK IS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IS A NATIONAL NON PROFIT DEDICATED. TO REPLACING THE FAILED DRUG WAR WITH POLICIES BASED ON COMPASSION SCIENCE PUBLIC HEALTH AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS -- WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S BUILT ON THE SAME POLICIES THAT FAILED TO PROTECT US FROM PROBLEMS RELATED TO HEROIN COCAINE AND FUN. IT WILL ADD AN ADDITIONAL THREE TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE SENTENCES AND WILL NOT REDUCE AVAILABILITY A FINAL. IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO PRISON OVERCROWDING. AN OVERLY LONG SENTENCES FOR PEOPLE INCLUDING LOW LEVEL DRUG MEALS. AND PEOPLE IN POSSESSION OF A SUBSTANCE THAT CONTAINS FENNEL AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT. TYPICALLY DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE NO INFORMATION TO TRADE. LOW LEVEL ON THE TOTEM POLE AND NOT EMPOWERED TO SAY NO. TO DRUG DEALERS ABOUT THEM IN THE SYSTEM. IT WOULD APPLY THE SAME PENALTIES TO SUBSTANCES CONTAINING FENTANYL THAT HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO DECADES TO COCAINE AND HEROIN. AND WE KNOW THAT APPLYING THESE ENHANCEMENTS DIDN'T WORK. COCAINE AND HEROIN ARE MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE MORE POWERFUL AND CHEAPER THAN EVER BEFORE SO WHY WOULD WE USE THE SAME FAILED APPROACH FOR FEDERAL. ALSO THERE'S THE COST BENEFIT QUESTION. ONE YEAR OF PRISON COST EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE YEAR OF METHADONE TREATMENT. IS FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT IT'S MORE INTELLIGENT TO SEND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE TO METHADONE THEN PUT EVEN ONE PERSON IN PRISON FOR ANOTHER YEAR. IT'S MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND ENHANCES PUBLIC SAFETY. THE APPROACH SUGGEST SB ONE SIXTY ONE DIDN'T WORK FOR COCAINE AND HEROIN IT WON'T WORK FOR FEDERAL. WE STRONGLY ADVISE THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY TO INVEST IN TREATMENT. PUBLIC HEALTH AND HARM REDUCTION POLICIES. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB. ONE SIXTY ONE I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE ON AND ALSO ADD THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE AND FINAL RELATED DEATHS AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT. FINAL IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DRUG. HOWEVER SB ONE SIXTY ONE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE EITHER OF THOSE FACTORS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THEIR EXISTING PENALTIES THAT ALREADY ADDRESS. THE ISSUE THE CONDUCT AT ISSUE IN SB. ONE SIXTY ONE A PERSON WHO POSSESSES FINAL FOR SALE CAN BE PUNISHED BY UP TO FOUR YEARS IN JAIL UNDER EXISTING LAW. AND A PERSON CAN BE PUNISHED BY UP TO FIVE YEARS IN JAIL FOR SIMPLY OFFERING TO GIVE AWAY FINAL THERE IS NO NEED TO EXPAND THE LAW FURTHER. SECOND SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS HAVE BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HAVE GENERATED NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT THEY DID TO HER OR PREVENT CRIME. AS TO THE PARTICULAR TYPE OF ENHANCEMENT AT ISSUE IN THIS BILL AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID WE NEED LOOK NO FURTHER THAN OUR OWN BACKYARD TO SEE THAT THIS ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENT AS APPLIED TO OTHER DRUGS. HAS NOT WORKED. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE ENHANCEMENTS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO HEROIN AND COCAINE UNDER CURRENT LAW THE NUMBER OF HEROIN RELATED OVER DEATH OVERDOSE DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA INCREASED BY 21% BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN ANDTWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE NUMBER OF COCAINE RELATED DEATH -- INCREASED BY 18% GIVEN THAT THE EXISTING ENHANCEMENTS HAVE NOT IMPROVED OUR SAFETY THERE IS LITTLE SENSE AND EXTENDING THE POLICY TO YET ANOTHER DRUG. AND LASTLY AND WITH RESPECT TO THE SENATOR THE EXISTING HAND ENHANCEMENTS ARE REMNANTS OF THE WAR ON DRUGS. WHICH WITH A HARMFUL FAILED APPROACH TO DRUG POLICY THAT HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISINVESTMENT IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WASTED RESOURCES REJECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACHES APPROACHES TO SUBSTANCE USE. AN EXCESSIVE PRISON AND JAIL SENTENCES THAT FALL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB. ONE SIXTY ONE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING EMILY HARRIS AT THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND WE OPPOSE THIS BILL. LESLIE CALDWELL FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. ISRAEL WE ARE WITH ME BONDS IN OPPOSITION. JANUARY TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN OPPOSITION. THE UNIVERSITY WOULD LEGAL SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH CHILDREN ALL OF US ARE NINE WE'RE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING AMBER ROSE HOWARD WITH CALIFORNIANS UNITED FOR RESPONSIBLE BUDGET AND WE OPPOSE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING -- NINE WE'LL TAKE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SENATOR MITCHELL. SURVEYS I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. HOWEVER. I AM CLEAR THAT FINN TO KNOW IS A BAD ACTOR THAT DOES GOES WITHOUT SAY. THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE ON THAT. I SPENT -- QUITE A BIT OF TIME IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS LEARNING -- AND WORKING HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE GOT TO THE PLACES POLICY MAKERS WERE WE THOUGHT SINCE ENHANCEMENTS. WHERE THE THING TO DO? THIRTY PLUS YEARS AGO I HAVE WORKED TO PEEL SOME OF THOSE BACK AND WHAT. I HOPE TODAY. IS THAT WE ALL CAN DO BETTER -- AND TALK ABOUT FROM WHAT WE KNOW TODAY BASED ON DATA IN RESEARCH. ABOUT WHAT WILL WORK. I THINK WITH POLICY MAKERS WE GET INTO THIS WE DISABILITY HEARING COMMITTEES UP OR DOWN. AND WE COLLECTIVELY DON'T PERHAPS BEEN ENOUGH TIME. THE AISLES EVEN HAVING MEANINGFUL PUBLIC POLICY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT. CAN BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT. CENTER STONE SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH ME ABOUT A WEEK AGO WE HAD A CONVERSATION ON FEDERAL HE WANT TO COME TO ME TO TALK ABOUT IT. IN MY SUGGESTION TO HIM THEN WAS LET'S CALL ALL OF THE INVESTED INTEREST TOGETHER AND HAVE CONVERSATION AS OPPOSED TO US AS POLICY MAKERS INTRODUCING LEGISLATION WE INTRODUCE A BILL THAT'S WHAT WE COME HERE TO DO. AND TALK COLLECTIVELY AND LEARN FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT -- SUBSTANCE. ABUSE A DISORDER -- POLICY SPECIALISTS -- SURVIVORS IF YOU WILL AND AND AND HAVE A MEANINGFUL COP PUBLIC POLICY CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW. TO BE TRUE TODAY -- I CAN'T SUPPORT. EIGHT A CITIZEN HAND SMIT BILL WEYAND THE RESEARCH STACKS AS HIGH AS I AM TALL ABOUT HOW THAT DIDN'T BOLD WHALE FOR US AS THE STATE -- ECONOMICALLY IT HAD ZERO IMPACT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS ON THE STREETS IT HAD NO IMPACT ON IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY AND SO I'M NOT INTERESTED IN CONTINUING POLICIES THAT WE KNOW DON'T WORK -- I THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE OF US TO SIMPLY DO THAT AS OPPOSED TO STEPPING BACK AND REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A BRIEF ALL THE PARTIES TO TOGETHER THAT IN A DISCUSSION. ABOUT WHAT CAN SO I'M HOPING -- SENATOR STONE -- ON AND PERHAPS JOINED BY YOU MISS BATES AND I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO TO BE A CO CONVENER IN THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION. BUT IN THE MEANTIME I I I CANNOT AND WILL NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT BILLS -- THAT THAT WE HAVE PROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN DON'T HAVE THE OUTCOME WE ANTICIPATE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT WANT TO BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. OTHER REAL SOLUTIONS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FIVE SENATOR. MOORLACH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'M I'M SORT OF IN THAT NO BETTERNO WORSE CATEGORY -- IF WE'RE FOCUSED ON HEROIN AND COCAINE. WE SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE SOME KIND WE HAVE THAT DISCUSSIONS -- OFFICE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I JUST WONDER CENTER BATES BE ANY REACTION TO OUR COMMENTS. CERTAINLY I DO YOU AND I I GUESS WHAT IS FRUSTRATING ALL ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT WE WE VIEW IT FROM THE EYES OF THE USER. AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO HELP WITH OUR REHABILITATION EFFORTS. IN OUR NONSENSE ENHANCEMENTS SENDING THEM TO REHABILITATION. THIS BILL AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS NOT ABOUT THE GUY THAT USE IT IS ABOUT ABOUT THE GUY WHO IS PRODUCING IT IN MASS QUANTITIES AND BRING IT INTO THIS COUNTRY. I GUARANTEE YOU AND ALL OF THE LITERATURE AND CERTAINLY THE MOVIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABOUT THIS BOTH DOCUMENTARY AND IN FICTIONAL. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THE HEAD OF THIS DON'T USE. THEY REALLY ARE PROFITEERS AND THE RINGING IN LARGE QUANTITIES THAT ARE THEN BROKEN DOWN AND LACED INTO THESE OTHER DRUGS. THEY DO HAVE SENSE ENHANCEMENTS BUT INTO YOU CUT OFF. THE IMPORTATION OF THESE LARGE QUANTITIES YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT FELT NOW IS PRODUCING AND CREATING IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE'S A NATIONAL CONCERN NOW IT'S BEEN ON CNN. IT'S BEYOND ME AND ON NBC AND WHAT THIS DRUG IS DOING AND I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST IT IS SO DANGEROUS THAT IT CAN BE USED WE CERTAINLY KNOW BY TERRORISTS. IN IF WE DON'T STOP THE IMPORTATION IN THESE LARGE QUANTITIES THAT IT WILL BE ON SERVE OUR WATCH THAT SOMETHING HORRIFIC OF HAPPENS SO I AM. I THINK WHAT SENATOR MITCHELL SAID HERE PERHAPS THAT'S THE PATH WE OUGHT. TO DO A LITTLE SIDE STEP ON THAT I WILL NOT FEES TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE IMPORTATION. OF THIS DRUG WHICH IS KILLING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT. IF NOT TOUCHING THEM IT'S NOT TOUCHING THEM THERE BRING IT IN HERE IN TRUCKLOADS AND YOU KNOW THAT FROM WHAT THE SHARE SAID ABOUT THIS FORTY POUNDS. ARE THAT WAS SIDE YOU KNOW CAPTURED AT THE BORDER ALL OF THAT SO THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO AND MAYBE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS HAVE THIS CONVENE. LET'S TALK WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO THE FENCE AND HANDS FROM THE WAY TO GO WOULD SURELY IF YOU PUT THE GUY WHOSE TRUCK LOADING IN HERE FOR TWENTY AWAY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THAT LEAVES ONE TRUCKLOAD OR TWENTY TRUCKLOADS IT HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR GOING TO START COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON HOW DO WE STOP IT. AT THAT LEVEL AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE RESUSCITATION OF THE POOR VICTIM. AND A OF THE THE GUY ON THE STREET WITH YOU KNOW SOMETHING WASTE INTO A PATH OF COCAINE OR WHATEVER USE FOR THAT. SO I WANT US TO CONCENTRATE ON THAT THAT'S WHY I KEEP BRINGING IT UP. NOW I'M GETTING NATIONAL ATTENTION ON IT NOT ME PERSONALLY BUT THE DRUG AND WOMEN DOING IN THIS COUNTRY. ATTENTION GUY NOT BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO SO I'M I'M HAPPY TO TO GO WITH SENATOR MITCHELL WHAT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO DO TODAY IS ON GIVE ME A RECONSIDERATION OR YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN OF THE STUDY BILL DO SOMETHING WITH IT. SO WE KEEP THE DISCUSSION AND THE DEBATE -- ALIVE BECAUSE I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE US IN TWO OR THREE YEARS TALKING ABOUT AN ENTIRE POPULATION OF SOME SMALL CITY WIPED OUT SOMEONE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DROP IT IN THE WATER. OR FLIGHT OVER THE CITY ARE IN A DRONE WHO KNOWS I MEAN THOSE ARE THERE'S CRAZY PEOPLE OUT THERE WE KNOW THAT AND THEY ARE NOT THE USERS. MIND YOU THEY ARE NOT THE USERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO STOP THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTENTION INTENDED TO DO HARM. TO US THIS COUNTRY IN OUR PEOPLE AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THE MANAGER -- SENATOR JACKSON AND SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU I I AM INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA OF MAKING THIS A STUDY BILL. AND WONDER IF THERE WOULD BE SOME CONSIDERATION I'LL TELL YOU WHY -- YOUR YOUR FRUSTRATION I THINK AS WELL NOTED. I THINK AS SENATOR MITCHELL INDICATED THE GUYS THAT ARE DOING THIS ARE BEYOND REACH WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCOURAGE THEM FROM MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY SAYING WE'RE GOING TO PUT YOU IN JAIL FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT EVEN IN THIS COUNTRY. AND IT IS THOSE MULES IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE -- IS SORT OF THE LOW HANGING FRUIT WHO WERE THE ONES THAT WE CATCH AND THE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY MANUFACTURING AND SMUGGLING THIS STUFF IN. NOTHING HAPPENS TO THEM SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND I'M ALL FOR THAT AND I THINK WE ALL ARE BECAUSE YOU YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT FENNEL IS A DISASTROUS DRUG AND I'M. NOTING HERE YOU'VE BROUGHT THIS BILL TWO OTHER TIMES I'VE BEEN STAYING BOTH OTHER TIMES NOT VOTED NO BUT NOT VOTED YES. BECAUSE I THINK THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO TRY TO ADDRESS WHETHER WE HAVE INTERDICTION REAL INTERDICTION -- WE KNOW THESE THINGS GENERALLY pNOT MISTAKEN AND IT AND THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING. THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING SOMETHING WE HAVE TRIED FOR YEARS THINKING THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE PEOPLE IF WE GAVE THEM LONG PRISON SENTENCES BUT IT HASN'T DONE A THING. SO I WOULD -- I WOULD SUPPORT A MEASURE THAT THAT THIS MEASURE IF IT COULD BECOME A STUDY BILL TO TRY TO FIND OUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY. TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FENNEL OR TO TO GET RID OF FENNEL OVERALL THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO BUT I I AGREE I DON'T THINK THAT. ADDING AN ENHANCEMENT OR PENALTY IT HAS IN ANY WAY DONE ANYTHING TO REDUCE OUR DRUG -- ISSUES IN THIS STATE AND COUNTRY WHICH I KNOW IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO SO IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THAT I WOULD CERTAINLY. BE SUPPORTIVE BUT AS THE BILL IS NOW I I ALSO CANCER. SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU -- THE DEBATE I HAVE A DEEP AND PROFOUND RESPECT FOR YOU YOU KNOW THAT AND I SHARE YOUR PASSION I HAVE SEEN. THE DOCUMENTARIES. BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME IS THIS SOUNDS. EERILY SIMILAR TO THE DEBATE IN THESE HALLOWED HALLS THIRTY YEARS AGO. WITH AROUND CRACK COCAINE. AND WE THOUGHT CALMED -- TO AARON EERILY SIMILAR BECAUSE THE FOCUS THEN WAS ON THE CAR TALES WE LOVE YOU THAT WORK GUARDED -- AND IT BECAME A SLIPPERY SLOPE IN TERMS OF THE POLICIES THAT THE OF MICHELLE AIM WITH THE CARTELS THAT WE'RE BRINGING IT INTO OUR CUT COUNTRY. AND WE KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS IN TERMS OF WHO ULTIMATELY ENDED UP SERVING -- MANY MANY YEARS LOCKED UP. IT WAS NOT JUST THE CARTELS AND SO THAT'S WHAT I MEAN I DON'T WANT US TO GO TO ONCE AGAIN WILLINGLY KNOWINGLY ENGAGE IN A SLIPPERY SLOPE PROCESS. OF POLICY MAKING. I HEAR YOU WHEN I GET IT AND IF I COULD BE CONVINCED THAT WE COULD CRAFT LEGISLATION IN SUCH A WAY. THAT JUST THOSE WHO BRING IN HE LARGE AMOUNTS WOULD BE IMPACTED THAT IS NOT BEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS BODY. AND WE CAN GO BACK AND DOCUMENT THAT IT IS NOT BEEN EXPERIENCE WE NOW HAVE FOUR HUNDRED SINCE ENHANCEMENT LAWS ON THE BOOKS. HAS THAT HELPED. I WOULD ARGUE NOT AND SO THAT'S WHY CAN'T SUPPORTTHE BILL AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO THINK IT'S NOT BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM I DO -- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY DOING THE SAME THING AND EXPECTING A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. WE NEED TO COME UP WITH THE NEW OUTCOME THAT TO REAL THAT'S GROUNDED AND WHAT WE KNOW TO BE DIFFERENT TODAY BASED ON HAVING MADE THESE POLICY DECISIONS THIRTY YEARS AGO. THAT THAT DID NOTHING BUT DECIMATE MAJOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND DID NOT INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY OR DEATH DECREASED ACCESS TO A DRUG WE'VE WE DIFFERENTIATE AT THE ENHANCEMENTS FOR ONE FORM OF THE DRUG OVER THE OTHER. AND THAT GOT US NO WHERE SO FOR THOSE REASONS I CAN'T SUPPORT CENTER WIENER. I THANK YOU ON CHARGES DODD BRIEFLY ICE IS ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY AND I'M PASSION AROUND BUT NO THIS IS JUST A HORRIFIC. I SUBSTANCE THAT IS DESTROYING LIVES AND KILLING PEOPLE -- AND I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR TENACITY -- BUT I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OF ENHANCEMENT FOR REASONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ARTICULATED BY DO MY SISTER KNOWLEDGE YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE CENTER THANK YOU THANK YOU. pCLOSE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS I HAD NOT -- AS WAS COMMUNICATED TO YOUR OFFICE MADE AN OFFICIAL RECOMMENDATION ON THE BILL BECAUSE ARE ONCE AGAIN WAS STRUGGLING WITH -- THE KNOWLEDGE JUST AS YOU DESCRIBED HOW MANY OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ARE NOW BEING IMPACTED BY THIS EXTREMELY LETHAL DRUG WHICH IS LEGAL IN VERY SMALL QUANTITIES -- AND SO I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THE APPROPRIATENESS OF HOW YOU KNOW HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS FACT THAT WE KNOW MORE FEDERAL IS COMING IN WE KNOW THAT TIME. IT'S IT'S USES EXPANDING. AND WHERE I A FINALLY LANDED -- BASICALLY. IN REVIEWING AGAIN MATERIALS LAST NIGHT AND THEN HEARING THE DISCUSSION TODAY IS THAT. YES WE WANT. TO IMPACT THE TRADE WE WANT TO STOP THE CARTELS WE WANT TO STOP THIS FROM COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY [inaudible] BUT IF [inaudible] THE IF. ADDING PENALTIES DID THAT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE HERE ONE ON THE STREET BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY SERIOUS PENALTIES FOR HEROIN. AND YET. WE HAVE HERE ONE ON STREET SO. WHERE I LANDED WAS THAT THIS WILL NOT ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT IS BEING SENT OUT? EVEN KNOWING. HOW LEGAL AND HOW DANGEROUS THIS DRUG IS AND HOW [inaudible] IT'S PREVALENCE IS INCREASING I'M. SO I THINK THAT SENATOR MITCHELL SUGGESTION. I IS PROBABLY GOOD ONE I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE STATE CAN DO TO TRY TO AFFECT THIS TYPE OF THREE BUT IT IS WORTH IT FOR SOME OF US TO SIT DOWN WITH EXPERTS AND THINK ABOUT IT -- I WOULD NOTE THAT. KIND OF QUANTITIES THAT YOU HAVE LISTED IN THE BILL ARE ALREADY -- HAVE CERES PENALTIES UNDER FEDERAL AND USUALLY IN THIS TYPE OF TRADE WHICH GOES BEYOND STATE BORDERS THE FEDS DO STEP IN -- SO AT LEAST I FEEL THAT IN MY NOT SUPPORTING THIS TODAY IT'S NOT LIKE I'M COMPLETELY IGNORING THERE IS FEDERAL STATUTE -- SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST IS THAT IF THE BILL DOES NOT PASS TODAY WE GRANT YOU RECONSIDERATION AND IF YOU WANT TO MODIFY. FOR TO SOME SORT OF STUDY OR EITHER IF YOU WANT TO BRING US BACK SOMETHING OR IF YOU JUST WANT. US. TO AGREED THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONVENE SOMETHING EITHER WAY -- BUT RIGHT NOW. WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE AND THEN WILL AS SORRY SENATOR MOREAU. YES THANK YOU SENATOR BATES YEAH I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT I AM GOING TO BE SUPPORT YOUR BILL. I I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE OF PUSH DRUGS AND RUN OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES IN CELL. I WISH THE SENTENCES WERE EVEN STRONGER SO -- I WILL. BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL THANK YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THE ARE YOU I'M I DON'T COUNT VOTES IN UPPORT OF THE BILL YET SO. OF CERTAINLY ALL ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION IF IT DOES NOT PASS AND THEN TAKEN UNDER A CONSIDERATION WHAT THE WHAT YOU CHAIRMAN HAVE SUGGESTED I THINK THAT'S THE ROUTE WILL TAKE. AND SEE IF WE CAN'T GET FROM CONVENE SOMETHING THAT GETS LEFT FILE AT LEAST FARTHER DOWN THE THE PATH TO DO -- IT FROM THIRTY INTERCEPTION OF THE DRUG COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY AND I THINK THAT THAT WILL CALIFORNIA'S LEAD ON SO MANY. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR OUR NATION NOW. SO LET SOME WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND ASKED RECONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- IS THERE A MOTION. OKAY SO WE HAVE A MOTION LET'S DO ROLL CALL. THIS IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. MORE LOCK. MOORLACH AYE BRADFORD JACKSON. MITCHELL MORALE HIGH MORALE AYE WIENER. WIENER NOW. SO WE WILL GRANT RECONSIDERATION. THE BILL FAILED -- BUT AS YOU REQUESTED WE WILL GRANT RECONSIDERATION THANK YOU OKAY THANKS SO MUCH [inaudible] I'M. WE WILL NOW MOVE -- TO ITEM. NINE NO SKEWS ME YES BELT SB TWO EIGHTY THREE SORRY RATHER BILLS I CONSENT. ITEM NINE SB ONE NINETY THREE SENATOR NIELSEN. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. OF BRING BEFORE YOU TODAY. SB ONE NINETY THREE AND I WANT TO THANK THE CONSULTANT FOR WORKING WITH. ON THE BILL. RELATED TO SOME CLARIFYING OR NARROWING AMENDMENTS. WE WOULD ACCEPT THOSE AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THAT APPLIES TO THIS BILL SOLELY TO THE SALES OF SMOKE. AND HEAD SHOTS. AS AMENDED THIS PROHIBITS RETAILERS OF TOBACCO AND TOBACCO RELATED PRODUCTS. IN OTHER WORDS WHAT ARE. CALLED SMOKE SHOP YOUR HEAD SHOPS. FROM SELLING NITROUS OXIDE. CANISTERS. THESE CANISTERS ARE SOLD WITH THE CRACKER AND WE HAD ONE AVAILABLE TO SHOW YOU BUT WOULD LIKE TO BRING IT IN HERE BUT IT'S IT'S A IT'S A DEVICE. THAT ALLOWS. AN INDIVIDUAL. TO INGEST IF YOU WILL NITROUS OXIDE AS MODIFIED THIS PRODUCTIVE DEVICE HAS GOT TO BE MODIFIED. FOR THAT PURPOSE. THEN THE OXIDE NECK NITROUS OXIDE IS PROVIDED BY. CANISTERS WHICH ARE SEPARATELY PURCHASED. THE HEAD OF THEY'RE CALLED IN THE STREET NAME. WEAPONS. SEEMS TO BE AN APT. TERM FOR SOMETHING THAT IS AS DANGEROUS IS THIS. THE DEVICE ITSELF IS THE INDUSTRIAL THAT CREAM DISPENSER WHICH HAD A GOOD THE NOBLE PURPOSE OF WOULD YOU OBJECT TO HER JUST LIFTING THAT UP AND JUST SHOWING. THAT'S THE DEVICE. THE CANISTERS ATTACHED THERE TO MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS. WE DON'T HAVE A THE CANISTER HERE -- ALTHOUGH -- ACT ANECDOTAL POINT -- I'M AWARE OF SOMEONE WHO WENT AND TRIED TO BUY A BOX OF CANISTERS TO SEE WHAT. HOW THAT PROCESS WORKS? ENTER SOME INTEREST. THE INDIVIDUAL. ASK DAN UPON THE COMPLETE I WANT THAT NITROUS OXIDE SO SHE WAS HAND THIS BY THE WHOEVER WAITED ON AND SHE SAID ANY THING YOU WANT. ANY INFORMATION FOR ME. AND THE PERSON WHO WAS SELLING IT SAID YES DO YOU WANT MORE OF THE MAYBE TWICE. THAT IS SOMEWHAT INSTRUCTIVE OF THE ATTITUDE IN THESE HEAD SHOPS. INHALING IT IS DANGEROUS. IT IS ILLEGAL. AND IT GIVES LONG TERM HEALTH PROBLEMS. IT CAN BE MENTAL IMPAIRMENT. IT CAN BE [inaudible] DEATH. ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS. MISS BETTER BRIAN CONTACTED MY OFFICE. AFTER HIS SON SHANE WHO IS HERE WITH US TODAY. WAS HOSPITALIZED USING WEAPONS. HE THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFE. THEY'VE BEEN REPRESENTED HIM AS SUCH BUT HE WILL SPEAK FOR HIMSELF HERE. AND WE HAVE ANOTHER. MOTHER AND WHOSE SON ALSO WAS AFFECTED. HE FORTUNATELY IS DOING FINE RIGHT NOW. BUT MY POINT IS [inaudible] THIS [inaudible] NITROUS OXIDE [inaudible] IS HORRIBLY. ADDICTIVE. VERY MUCH AFFECTING INDIVIDUALS. IN SOME CASES HUNDREDS OF CANISTERS HAVE BEEN FOUND. WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE UC'S. SO BY VIRTUE OF THE BILL WE ARE SIMPLY LIMITING [inaudible] THE ACCESS [inaudible] TO THE NITROUS OXIDE. AND THAT. WOULD BE GOOD [inaudible] FOR HUMANKIND. IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE WITNESSES YES THEY BROUGHT -- CENTERS SOME FOR WE GO TO YOUR WITNESS IS I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE THAT -- THIS BILL NOW WITH THE AMENDMENTS IS VERY COMPARABLE TO THE BILL THAT WE PASSED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THERE IS NO KNOWN OPPOSITION BUT WITNESSES IN. PLEASE PROCEED. IF I NEEDED [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS BARBARA LARGE. NATIVE OF LOS ANGELES LIVING IN WEST LA. I'M AN ATTORNEY A WRITER A MOTHER OF TWO ADULT CHILDREN. AND I AM HERE BECAUSE MY TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD SON SUSTAINED BRAIN DAMAGE FROM A SEVERE ADDICTION TO NITROUS OXIDE. WHICH HE FED. BY REGULARLY PURCHASING THIS DRUG IN SMOKING TOBACCO SHOPS ACROSS LOS ANGELES. HERE'S A PICTURE OF JUST SOME OF THE USED CANISTERS HE ACCUMULATED ALL OF WHICH I FOUND IN HIS CAR I CAN PASS THESE AROUND ANYBODY INTERESTED. I'LL HAVE TO START [inaudible] OKAY. FOUND IN HIS CAR IS ROUGH ON HIS CAR THOUSANDS AND YES IN HIS CAR. MANY WHO ABUSED NITROUS DO SO AS SOON AS THEY BUY IT OFTEN INHALING IT IN PARKING LOTS OR EVEN WHILE DRIVING. RECENT NEWS REPORTS HAVE DISCUSSED THE RASH OF FATAL CAR ACCIDENTS IN LOS ANGELES. WHERE THE DRIVER HI ON NITROUS PASSED OUT BEHIND THE WHEEL? NO JUST OXIDE BECAME MY SON'S DRUG OF CHOICE BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN HE WAS LIVING IN A LOCAL SOBER LIVING. A ROOMMATE INTRODUCED IT TO HIM AS A WAY TO USE AND NOT GET CAUGHT. NITROUS IS 1100% UNDETECTABLE ON DRUG TESTS. AND HE LIKED IT. YEARS LATER FRIENDS TRIED TO HELP HIM BY DOING A NITROUS OXIDE INTERVENTION AND I PICTURED MY SWEET BOY CRUMPLED ON THE COUCH WILD EYED TWITCHING CLUTCHING THE CRACKER LIKE IT WAS HIS BABY BOTTLE. THIS DRUG IS ABSOLUTELY ADDICTIVE. AND HAILING WHIPPETS PROVIDES A SHORT YET INTENSE EUPHORIA SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS FORTY SECONDS OF ABSOLUTE BLISS. A LITTLE LIKE BEING BACK INSIDE THE WOMB. BY MOST DRUGS THIS POWERFUL ONE WOULD NORMALLY NEED TO FIND A SHADY DEALER OR CONSULT THE DARK WEB. BUT THIS. THIS HI IS OFFERED IN PLAIN SIGHT. SIMPLY ONE IN THE CORNUCOPIA OF INHALANTS OFFERED FOR SALE AND SMOKE AND TOBACCO SHOPS. AND THAT BLISSFUL ROOM LIKE FEELING. THAT'S THE FEELING OF BRAIN CELLS SUFFOCATING AND DYING. WHEN A PERSON INHALES NITROUS OXIDE HE'S PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH HIS LIFE? THIS MEANS THERE'S A VERY REAL CHANCE HE COULD DIE DURING HIS FIRST INHALE OR ANY OF THE ONES THAT FOLLOW. THE BROTHER OF A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE AND HELD NITROUS AND DIED INSTANTANEOUSLY. AND THE FACT THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN MY SON TERRIFIES ME TO MY CAR. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH INHALING NITROUS CAN ALSO DAMAGE ONCE LIVER KIDNEYS AND BONE MARROW. IT CAN CAUSE CONVULSIONS CAESAR'S DEMENTIA BLINDNESS PARALYSIS COMA HEART FAILURE AND DEATH FROM ASPHYXIATION OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SUDDEN SNIFFING DEATH SYNDROME. ALTHOUGH MY SON HAS SINCE COMMITTED TO A LIFE OF SOBRIETY. THE REALITY IS THAT ANY DAY OR NIGHT HE CAN WALK INTO ANY SMOKE SHOP AND BE TEMPTED TO BUY EVERYTHING HE NEEDS. TO RESUME THIS DEADLY JACK GAME OF CHANCE. RECENTLY I PAID A VISIT TO A LOCAL SMOKE SHOP I TOLD THE SALESMAN I WAS LOOKING FOR NITROUS OXIDE FOR A PARTY I WAS GIVEN. HE POINTED TO THE CORNER OF A STORE AT A PLASTIC TUB BREAM BRIMMING WITH VIBRANT COLORED BALLOONS. BOOKENDED BY BOXES UPON BOXES OF WITH IT THE ORIGINAL. WITHIN MINUTES I'M WALKING OUT THE DOOR WITH A TWELVE DOLLAR CARTON TWENTY FOUR CREAM CHARGERS AND ORANGE AND BLUE BALLOONS IN A DISCREET BLACK BAG FOR A PARTY I'M GIVING. BY CONTINUING TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO THE WIDESPREAD AND RECKLESS SALE OF NITROUS OXIDE IN SMOKE AND TOBACCO SHOPS. WE ARE SENDING A MESSAGE THAT IN HAILING THIS DEADLY DRUG IS AS INNOCENT AND FUN AS ITS COLORFUL BALLOONS AND NEON CANISTERS SUGGEST. WHILE I'M NO EXPERT I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER. THIS LONG OVERDUE PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS CALIFORNIA'S CHANCE TO STEM THE FLOW OF THIS DEADLY DRUG AND TO HOLD THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS ILLICIT SALE ACCOUNTABLE. PLEASE JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING SENATE BILL ONE NINETY THREE CALIFORNIANS ARE DESPERATE FOR YOUR PROTECTION. THANK YOUR NEXT WITNESS. NEXT WITNESS WE'RE HAVING ONLY TWO AT THE TABLE [inaudible] THANK. OF MONEY MISSION BRIAN AND I'M SPEAKING YOU BECAUSE I'VE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ABUSING NITROUS. AND SEEING FIRSTHAND MY OWN BODY THE NEUROTOXIC EFFECTS IT HAS. A FEW YEARS AGO I STARTED DOWN MY PATH WITH NITROUS STARTED WITH SMALL AMOUNTS OF FIRST ROUND TWENTY CANISTERS YOU COULD EASILY BY FROM SMOKE SHOP. AND THEN WORKING UP TO AROUND TWO HUNDRED CANISTERS PER DAY. I DIDN'T REALIZE THE DANGER BECAUSE I KNOW THE DENTIST USES. AND IF THE DENTISTS ARE ABLE TO USE THAT THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY DANGEROUS RIGHT. BUT WAS UNTIL I LEARNED WITH NEUROLOGISTS LATER THAT EVEN UNDER THE CAREFUL CONTROL OF DENTISTS THERE ARE SOMETIMES PERMANENT DAMAGE FROM NITROUS. IT WAS BECAUSE OF MY HIGH NITROUS INJECTED I LOST MY ABILITY TO WALK OVER THE COURSE OF MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER BEING BOUND TO A WHEELCHAIR I SLOWLY BEGAN TO REGAIN MY ABILITY. I WENT FROM A WHEELCHAIR TO A WALKER FROM THE WALKER TO A CANE. AND FROM THE CAME TO A PAIR OF ORTHODONTICS TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO WALK ON MY OWN FOR YOU TODAY. EVEN THOUGH I CAN NOW WALK I WILL LIKELY HAVE PERMANENT NERVE DAMAGE IN MY PERIPHERALS. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO HELP ENSURE THAT NOBODY ELSE GOES THROUGH THE PHYSICAL PAIN AND TO BUILD DEBILITATION THAT I WENT THROUGH BY ADDING YOUR SUPPORT TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW YOU MAY -- INDICATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION AND THEN WE'LL ASK ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. WELL MY NAME'S PATRICK BRANHAM FATHER SHANE. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BRENDAN UP ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SUPPORT AND ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE RIVERSIDE DIPPY SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. JOHN LEVEL CALIFORNIA NARCOTIC OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND LA COUNTY PROFESSIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IS AN SUPPORT MORGAN GUY ON THEIR BEHALF. CANON PRIMER EMPOWER FAMILY CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE A GENETIC DEFECT IN THF FAR I MAY NOT KNOW IT. THAT THIS DRUG COULD KILL JUST ON THAT THE FACT ALONE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEEING NINE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THE ONE NINE THREE YES. OKAY AS AMENDED. ON ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION CENTER NIELSEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE LET'S TRY TO AT LEAST. ELIMINATE SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES. THIS VERY DANGEROUS [inaudible] NITROUS OXIDE [inaudible] CERTAINLY. AND AS I STATED BEFORE FOR TO GROW CALLS IS VERY COMPARABLE TO THE BILL THAT WE PASSED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO WE WILL NOW. HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE. ACTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO BE IN PAIN SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. WELL LIKE I BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE JACKSON. JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MITCHELL AYE MORALE WIENER. WIENER AYE. I WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPENED BUT YOU DO HAVE ADEQUATE VOTES FOR THE BILL TO PASS BUT IT WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE MISSING MEMBER AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. WE GOT. RIGHT THROUGH THAT THEM NOTICES THAT BILLS OUT [inaudible] UNANIMOUS. ALRIGHT SO WE WILL NOW GO TO YOUR NEXT BILL WHICH IS SB. ONE NINETY FOUR MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE INTENTION OF SB ONE NINETY FOUR IS. TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY. AND THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. ON OUR CAMPUSES OF HIGHER EDUCATION [inaudible] IN CALIFORNIA. THESE INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE THE MARKETPLACE OF GOOD IDEAS. OPEN EXCHANGE OF THOSE IDEAS. WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN? EXERCISE THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. FREELY AND OPENLY. IN RECENT YEARS THOUGH. THAT HAS BEEN COMPROMISED ON SOME CAMPUSES. BY INDIVIDUALS WHO COME ON TO THE CAMPUS. MANY OF WHOM HAVE NO AFFILIATION. A REASON TO BE THERE MASKED. NOW THERE THERE ARE. TWO PROTEST OR MAKE STATEMENTS WHATEVER. THAT IN CASES THESE. VISIT SEVEN VERY DESTRUCTIVE OF PROPERTY. LIVE IN VIOLENT ACTS. AND WITHOUT QUESTION THEY HAVE INTERFERED WITH THE EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. OF THE INSTITUTION. AND THE INTIMIDATING ASPECT OF THIS. IS THE MASK. MASK SHOULD HOLLOW WE MAY BE YEARS UP AND WERE USED. TO BUT NORMALLY WHEN SOMEONE IS TRYING. TO HIDE THEIR IDENTITY. IT'S FOR SOME PARTICULAR REASON. THAT THEY ARE AFRAID OF AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. THEY'RE AFRAID OF BEING A DOLLARS FOR WHO THEY ARE ON THIS CAMPUS DISRUPTING. THE CAMPUS ENVIRONMENT. SO WHAT THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES. THAT ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUILDING ON EXISTING LAW. TO STOP ANY INDIVIDUAL. IF THE OFFICER HAS A REASONABLE SUSPICON THAT THIS INDIVIDUALS HERE. COULD BE. OR IS INTENDING TO BE INVOLVED. IN A CRIME. AND THEY SIMPLY HAVE. WOULD. TELL THAT INDIVIDUAL. TO REMOVE THE MASK. AND TO DISCLOSE THEIR IDENTITY. BY SO DOING. IT IS A VERY SIMPLE BILL. AND IT WOULD PRESERVE I THINK. A MUCH SAFER ENVIRONMENT WITHIN OUR CAMPUSES. AND AN ASSURANCE OF OUR STUDENTS TO GO THERE [inaudible] THAT INDIVIDUALS. WHO DO NOT WANT TO SHOW THEIR IDENTITIES? ARE NOT THERE FOR THE PURPOSE. AGAIN A BIT TO BILL AND AN EXISTING LAW. AND THE ESSENCE OF IT IS THE OFFICER ENQUIRING WILL YOU. DISCLOSURE IDENTITY BY REMOVING YOUR MASK. DO I HAVE NO WITNESSES THAT CASH STAFF MEMBERS CERTAINLY ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN THE AUDIENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I WANT TO JUST COME TO THE MIKE. JOHN LEVEL WITH THE A CALIFORNIA COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. THIS DOES HAVE PUBLIC SAFETY IMPLICATIONS ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. IS THE PROSPECTING FOR AT OF ACTIVE SHOOTERS IN COLLEGE CAMPUSES IS A CHILLING STAT BUT LAST YEAR. WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENT ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS SOMEPLACE IN THIS COUNTRY ONCE EVERY EIGHT DAYS. MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SHAUN RUN WITH THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THE MEASURE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB. ONE NINETY FOUR FIRST WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY IT IS ALREADY A MISDEMEANOR IN CALIFORNIA. TO WEAR A MASK FOR THE PURPOSE OF EVADING OR ESCAPING IDENTIFICATION IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME. IT IS ALSO A MISDEMEANOR IN CALIFORNIA TO WEAR A MASK FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONCEALMENT FLIGHT OR ESCAPE WHEN CHARGED WITH ARRESTED FOR OR CONVICTED OF A CRIME. THESE LAWS APPLY TO PEOPLE ON SCHOOL COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES AS THEY DO AND ANY OTHER PUBLIC SPACES. SECOND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT SB ONE NINETY FOUR COULD BE USED. TO VIOLATE CALIFORNIANS RIGHT. IN PARTICULAR WE FEAR THAT SB ONE NINETY FOUR COULD BE USED AS A PRETEXT FOR CONTENT BASED CENSORSHIP IN THE CONTEXT OF LAWFUL CAMPUS PROTESTS. PERMITTING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO REQUIRE A PERSON TO REMOVE A MASK WHEN THERE IS NO PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE WHEN THERE IS NO PROBABLE CAUSE FOR ARREST AS SB ONE NINETY FOUR PROPOSES -- COULD EASILY LEAD TO DIFFERENTIAL ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROPOSED LAW BASED ON THE CONTENT OF A MASS PERSONS MESSAGE THE PERSON'S APPEARANCE OR IDENTIFYING CHARACTERISTICS OR THE MANNER OF PROTEST. IT IS ALSO UNCLEAR WHETHER THE STANDARD OF REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT THE PERSON HAS BEEN OR IS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN A CRIME. IS SUFFICIENTLY TAILORED TO BALANCE LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST AGAINST LAWFUL FIRST AMENDMENT SPEECH. AND LASTLY WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT SUFFICIENT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THIS COMMITTEES REJECTION OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR TO WARRANT PASSAGE NOW. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CAN JUST COME TO THE MIKE. ON THE FLOOR. HI LIZ ONE GRADUATE STUDENT AT UC DAVIS I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL [inaudible] ANY OTHERS. RIGHT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY MY COLLEAGUES [inaudible] CENTER MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR JUST SKINNER -- THIRTY NIELSEN I COMPLETELY YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE HISTORY OF OF MASKS OR HOODS WORN BY PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED IN RIOTOUS BEHAVIOUR IN. MORE RECENT YEARS TIKI TORCHES BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION OR CONCERN IS IT OTHER THAN THE UC BERKELEY EXAMPLE -- IT IN MANY INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN -- PROTESTS YOU'LL SEE THEM TIED BANDANNAS ACROSS THEIR FACE PRIMARILY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM. OF THE THE THE GAS. CANISTERS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT -- ARE PRONE TO USED TO GO TO BREAK UP -- PROTESTS. AND SO. WOULD IT INDIVIDUAL WHO IS COVERED THEIR FACE TO PRODUCE PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM TEAR GAS DIDN'T HAVE AN ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL CHARGE LEVIED AGAINST THEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT THEIR EFFORT TO EBAY LOG FORCE WAS THEIR EFFORT TO TRY TO PROTECT HIMSELF FROM TEAR GAS COULD THAT. PERSON YOU GET CAUGHT UP IN IN THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL BECAUSE BECAUSE I WOULD HOPE NOT. YOU MAY ANSWER SENATE A MEASURE THAT IS NOT AT ALL THE INTENT. IT WOULD AND WHAT WHAT THE MASK COVERING THE NOSE WITH IT TOTALLY. THIS. THE SKY'S THE IDENTITY NOT NECESSARILY. THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER VISUAL IDENTIFICATION. AND THIS DOES NOT MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO BE CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR THIS SIMPLY MEANS THE OFFICER. HAVING SUSPICION WOULDN'T SIMPLY INQUIRE WOULD YOU REMOVE IT. WHATEVER WOULD HAPPEN AFTER THAT THAT WOULD BE DEPENDING ON WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WAS DISCLOSED TO THE INDIVIDUAL IT WOULD BE PROBABLY SOMEWHAT DETERMINED BY THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PEOPLE. TO I CANNOT SPEAK FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT THEIR PROTOCOLS BUT WHAT THEY ARE TRAINED TO DO BUT AGAIN. IT IS NOT OUR INTENT FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO AVOID THE THE THE THE GAS. WHAT I WANT TO HAVE A MASK ON FOR THAT PURPOSE OR IF YOU SAID A BANDANNA? AND THAT WOULD BE THEIR OPPORTUNITY WHEN THEY THEN WERE CONFRONTED TO THE OFFICER THEY COULD SIMPLY EXPLAINED THAT AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WOULD BE VERY COGNIZANT. AND SENSITIVE TO THAT CONCERT. BUT SIR YOU SAY THAT THAT IT IT WOULD NOT LEAD TO A DISTRIBUTOR BUT IF I'M LOOKING READING THE ANALYSIS CORRECTLY PAGE TWO IT SAYS THAT THIS BILL SAY FOR THE PERSON WHO FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE OFFICER. OR OFFICIAL DEMAND HAS WILLFULLY DISRUPTED THE ORDERLY OPERATION OF A CAMPUS FACILITY AND IS GUILTY OF A MISDEMEANOR AND SO IF I SAY I'M NOT GONNA REMOVE MY MASK. THEN I AM SUBJECT SUBJECT TO A MISDEMEANOR I WILL NOT DISPUTE THAT OKAY. RIGHT THANK YOU SIR. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. BY SENATOR MORE LIKE. I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL AYE AYE I THINK SOMETHING DISTURBING EVEN HISTORICALLY OF OF WEARING MASKS. INAPPROPRIATE TIMES THAT FUNCTIONS FIGHT. I THINK THIS IS LONG OVERDUE. SUPPORT THE BILL [inaudible] I'M. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY JUST AS I DID NOT IN THE LAST YEAR -- AND MY REASON IS DUE TO THE NOTE THE STATE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT IT IS ALREADY A MISDEMEANOR IF YOU ARE WEARING. A MASK AND YOU ARE AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT -- BELIEVES THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED IN A CRIMINAL ACT THEN THEY CAN. BOTH DEMAND YOUR REMOVAL OF THE MASK AND CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR JUST FOR WEARING THE MASK. AND IT SEEMS TO ME AND THAT WORKS ON CAMPUSES OR IN PUBLIC SETTINGS OR WHEREVER SO THAT LAW IS IT ALREADY APPLIES TO OUR CAMPUSES. SO I DON'T SEE THE NEED TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL LAW -- SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY -- BUT LET'S SEE IF THERE'S A MOTION ON RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION -- THE MANAGER I THINK THE TESTIMONY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS HERE TODAY GIVE SOME INDICATION. OF THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM. AND THAT THAT IS A REAL PROBLEM. ON OUR CAMPUSES. AND IT DOES HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT. ON OUR CAMPUSES. AND I WILL INTEND TO CONTINUE TO RAISE THIS CONCERN. TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. I ASKED AND I WILL. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION -- LOOKS TO ROLL CALL. MOST IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER NOPE SKINNER NOW MORE LOCK. MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD JACKSON [inaudible] MITCHELL. MORALE. HI WIENER. WIENER NOW. THANK YOU MAY FEEL FEELS THANK YOU. AND WE WILL NOW GO TO OUR NEXT ITEM WHICH WOULD BE -- IEM TWELVE SENATOR BILL. IT IS SB. TWO EIGHTY FOUR I'M WHILE YOU'RE BRINGING UP YOUR WITNESSES LET'S ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. ALL RIGHT CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL. FIVE I OR LACK. MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD BRADFORD AYE JACKSON MITCHELL. KIDS CONSENT FIVE MITCHELL AYE MORALE WIENER. WIENER AYE. RIGHT -- SENATOR BAIL YOU MAY BEGIN. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- THIS BILL SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR IS THE KEY VIEWS CLOSE TO HOME ACT. THE ANNUAL COST -- TO CONFINED YOUTH AT THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AVERAGES. ARE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER USER PER YEAR. OF THAT AMOUNT THE COUNTIES UNDER CURRENT LAW ONLY CONTRIBUTE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. WITH THE STATE PAYING THE REST OF THE COST. NOW THE BEST PRACTICES SHOW THAT LOCAL REHABILITATION IS MORE EFFECTIVE YET THE CURRENT LO FI INCENTIVIZE IS COUNTIES. TO SEND USED TO THE REMOTE STATE FACILITIES. THE STATE FUNDS COUNTIES WITH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY -- TO SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL INCLUDING FUND SPECIFICALLY EARMARKED FOR TREATING HIDING ISSUE. IN LOCAL FACILITIES AND INSTEAD OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DENNIS WOULD BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE COUNTIES. ALL OF YOU HAVE -- BELOW AVERAGE IN TERMS OF THE RATE OF COMMITTING YOU'VE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. HOWEVER ALL CALIFORNIANS TAXPAYERS ARE SUBSIDIZING THE COST FOR SMALL NUMBERS OF COUNTIES THAT ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE STATE FACILITY. THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE ANNUAL FEE BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE AND MAINTAINED. IT WITH THE INTENT OF TO INCENTIVIZE LOCAL REHABILITATION. YET WE ARE SEEKING EXTREME BACON'S WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW EXTREME VACANCIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OVER OVER HALF THE THE BEDS AT THE LOCAL EVER ACTUALLY VACANT. AND WE ALSO -- HAVE DISTRICT A GREAT DEAL DISCREPANCIES IN VARIATION IN THE COUNTIES RATE. OF SENDING YOU TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. THE BILL AIMS TO CLOSE -- A KEEP YOU OF CLOSE TO HOME AND SPUR LOCAL REHABILITATION COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORT. BY INCREASING THE COUNTY FEE FROM TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOUTH. WHO -- COMMITTED OFFENSE UNDER THE AGE EIGHTEEN AND USED TO COMMIT AN OFFENSE WHICH WILL CARRY A SENSE OF FEWER THAN SEVEN YEARS. ADD THE BEEN TRIED AS AN ADULT. THE TO THE TWENTY TWELVE DATA SHOWS THAT 74% OF THE U. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. RESERVE IT'D -- WITHIN THREE YEARS OF RELEASE. THE STUDIES ALSO SHOW THE JUST DO YOUTH ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE AS THEY MOVE FROM ADOLESCENCE TO ADULTHOOD. THESE LEARNING YEARS ARE CRITICAL TO THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE KNOW THAT THE TRAUMA CONFINEMENT THE STATE FACILITIES -- TRAUMA IS A HAS AN IMPACT ON ON USE AT THE STATE FACILITIES AND WE KNOW THAT LOCAL REHABILITATION. AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AS PROVEN FAR MORE EFFECTIVE. CLOSE REGULAR CONTACT WITH LOVED ONES AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS ARE BENEFICIAL USE WELLNESS AND INSURERS THEIR SUCCESS UPON RELEASE. THIS BILL AIMS TO PROMOTE LOCAL REHABILITATION FOR ITS SUPPORT OF SAFE ENVIRONMENTS AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM. OF TURN OVER TO MY WITNESSES -- THE RESTAURANT. GOOD MORNING MAUREEN WASHBURN WITH THE CENTER ON JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT FEE FOR COMMITTING USED TO DJJ JUST TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOU. REPRESENTS A FRACTION OF THE TRUE COST OF THE STATE SYSTEM. WHICH NOW EXCEEDS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S NOW LESS EXPENSIVE FOR COUNTIES TO PAY THE CITY. THE TO KEEP YOUTH IN LOCAL FACILITIES. THIS CREATES A PROBLEMATIC INCENTIVE FOR COUNTIES TO SEND YOUTH TO DISTANCE STATE INSTITUTION. AND THE RESULTS IS STARK GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES WITH THE STATE FOOTING THE BILL. FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT RELY HEAVILY ON THE STATE SYSTEM. WHILE MOST JURISDICTIONS SAID FEW OR NO USE TO DJJ. A RECENT RESEARCH FINDS THE DJJ FACILITIES CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS THEY HAVE FOR DECADES. AS PRISON LIKE SETTINGS. THAT EXPOSE YOUTH TO SERIOUS TRAUMA. YOUTH CANNOT FLOURISH IN DANGEROUS AND ISOLATING ENVIRONMENTS. INSTEAD THEY FARE BEST WHEN THEY ARE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT THEY'LL NEED WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED. THESE CLOSE TO HOME SETTINGS ALREADY EXIST AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND THEY'RE OPERATING AT JUST WHICH MEANS THEY COULD ABSORB DJS POPULATION MORE THAN THIRTEEN TIMES OVER. AND COUNTIES RECEIVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS EACH YEAR IN STATE pFUNDING FOR LOCAL SERVICES AND ALTERNATIVES TO DJJ. AND TWENTY TWO COUNTIES HAVE pRENOVATE LOCAL FACILITIES THAT MEET YOUTH TREATMENT NEEDS. WITH THE SUPPORT OF STATE DOLLARS AND LOCAL INVESTMENT. PROBATION DEPARTMENTS HAVE DEVELOPED MODEL PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY TREATMENT AND CARE IN A SECURE SETTING. SO TO BRING YOU CLOSER TO HOME AND EXTEND THE LOCAL INNOVATION ALREADY HAPPENING IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR THANK YOU MISS WASHBURN.

PARKIN AND PROBATION HAS BEEN A PARTNER. WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH -- MANY ADMINISTRATIONS OVER THE YEARS TO WORK ON KEEPING KIDS LOCALLY INVESTING IN THE SYSTEM AND REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ONLY RESERVING. THE DJJ AND AND SECURE SETTINGS FOR THOSE YOU TO POSE THE HIGHEST RISK OF OF RE OFFENSE AND HAVE THE HIGHEST NEED -- I THINK THIS -- COMMITMENT TO THOSE THINGS AS EVIDENCED BY THE OVER 74% DECLINE IN YOUTH COMMITTED TO DJJ OVER THE YEARS AND A 60% DECLINE IN JUVENILE DETENTION -- IN ITS ENTIRETY -- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A CONTINUUM OF CARE AND CERTAINLY WALL -- WE ALWAYS ENDEAVOR TO SERVE YOUTH AT THE FRONT END OF THE SYSTEM -- WHERE POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS A NEED -- FOR THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND THE STATE ROLE -- EGGMAN AGAIN AT DJJ IS RESERVE FOR THE THE HIGHEST NEED YOUTH THE HIGHEST A RISK TO RE OFFEND AND POTENTIALLY YOU THAT NEED MORE SPECIALIZED PROGRAMMING -- THAT COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE. I KNOW PART OF THE STATED GOAL OF THIS BILL TIME IS TO INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES -- TO KEEP MORE YOUTH LOCALLY AND AND IN DOING SO REALLY GOES BACK TO KIND OF THE THE REFERENCE TO THE SLIDING SCALE THAT WAS PUT INTO A FACT -- IN THE NINETIES BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WAS THAT THAT SLIDING SCALE WAS REALLY -- PUT INTO PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE DJJ POPULATION WAS VERY VERY HIGH -- AND AND THERE WAS A LARGE POPULATION OF KIND OF LOWER RISK OFFENDERS THAT -- THE STATE WAS TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO KEEP LOCALLY -- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WITH SB EIGHTY ONE ON THAT SET FOR THE JUVENILE REALIGNMENT IN WHICH PROBATION WAS A PARTNER OF AND THAT ENDED COMMITMENTS OF NONVIOLENT YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS TO DJJ SO THAT REALLY WAS THE CATALYST -- FOR KEEPING THOSE LOWER RISK -- YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS OUT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO NOW -- REINSTITUTING KIND OF THIS SLIDING SCALE -- AT A TIME WHEN THE SYSTEM LOOKS MUCH DIFFERENT THE SAME INCENTIVES -- I THINK AS AS IS -- FOR IT AS THE INTENT OF THIS BILL REALLY DON'T HOLDEN AND INSTEAD WERE ACTUALLY VERY CONCERNED THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF IMPACT DEAN OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO THOSE YOUTH LOCALLY IN OUR CARE -- ULTIMATELY THE HEALTH WELFARE AND WELL BEING OF YOUTH IS OUR PRIMARY GOAL IN MAKING SURE THEY'RE IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT WHETHER THAT BE LOCALLY OR THE STATE AND AND CERTAINLY WE WORK WITH THE THE COURTS TOWARD THAT END AS THEY MAKE THE ULTIMATE DECISION ON IN IN PLACING. AND DJJ -- BUT FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS -- WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE TODAY WE CERTAINLY LOOK FOR TO CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SENATOR AND THE SPONSOR. THANKS NEXT -- WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING JESSICA DIMENSIONS THE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AT ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION I DO WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE SENATOR AND HIS OFFICE. HAVING NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH US AND LISTENING TO OUR CONCERNS AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A CONTINUE DIALOGUE. SO WITH REGARD TO TWO EIGHTY FOUR COUNTY SHARE IN THE GOAL OF TREATING HOUSING AS MANY JUSTICE INVOLVED YOU AS POSSIBLE AND THEIR COMMUNITY. AND THIS HAPPENED 90% OF THE TIME. COUNTY PROBATION HAS WORKED HARD TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF YOUTH IN THEIR JUVENILE HALLS AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF COMMITMENTS TO THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. INNOVATIVE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING COUNTY THE KEPT MORE YOUTH IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF YOUTH THAT THEY SEND TO DJJ BY 74%. AND BACKED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WERE. FORTY FIVE HUNDRED FELONY JUVENILE ARRESTS. LA ONLY HAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YOU ROUGHLY AND DJJ. MEANING THAT LESS THAN 3% OF LA'S FELONY JUVENILE ARRESTS. LED TO A DJ COMMITMENT. ALEX HAS DONE THIS THROUGH PROVIDING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING AND THE COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY OUR CONCERN IS THAT THIS LEGISLATION COULD IMPACT THAT PROGRAMMING. THE VAST MAJORITY THAT IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUTH THAT ARE BEING SENT TO DJJ OUR YOUTH THAT CANNOT BE HOUSE LOCALLY BECAUSE THE COUNTY OF NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. LIKE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED PROGRAMMING SUCH AS YOU THROUGH COMMITTED SEX OFFENSES AND NEED THE STATE'S SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT PROGRAM. AND IF APPROPRIATE PROGRAMMING IS NOT AVAILABLE THE COURT WHO ACTUALLY MAKES THE ULTIMATE DECISION AS TO WHETHER TO SEND A YOUTH DJJ WILL HAVE TO COMMIT THAT YOU. SO YOUTH WILL CONTINUE TO BE COMMITTED TO DJJ AND COUNTIES WILL JUST BE FORCED TO PAY MORE TOWARDS OUR COMMITMENT. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL CREATE AN INCENTIVE TO HOUSE MORE USED LOCALLY. AND THAT IT WILL INSTEAD PLACE A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE COUNTIES THEREBY DIMINISHING PROBATION BUDGET AND PUTTING EXISTING PROGRAMMING IN JEOPARDY. I DO WANT TO ADD THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS OFFICE ON BINDING MAYBE ALTERNATE SOLUTIONS. AND WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FIGURED ABOUT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT -- I CENTER BILL MAY I FIRST ASK IF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY. OTHER COMMENT A CORRECTION OR LET ME SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND ALL THAT [inaudible] ARE THERE. ALL RIGHT GO AHEAD OF WE HAVE A LETTER FROM JACQUI LACY -- COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF LOS ANGELES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IT WAS INDICATED THERE BY A TESTIMONY THAT WE THAT THE DA EN LA WAS NOT IN FAVOR OF THE BILL OR NEUTRAL. HERE'S A LETTER IF YOU WANNA RESERVE. OKAY WE HAVE DELEGATED -- MARCH SIX WHICH TO THE COMMITTEES ON A LOT WE DO WE DO HAS WATER AND A BELIEVE IT'S IN THE BACK -- SO I I AM SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. AND I WANT TO RAISE A COUPLE ISSUES THOUGH. I THINK IT IS -- WHAT I THINK IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS RIGHT AT GIVEN THEIR? SO ARE -- THE AUTHOR HAS PROVIDED US A CHART WHICH SHOWS US HOW MUCH ROOM IS IN OUR COUNTY FACILITIES NOW WE KNOW THAT. OUR DJ JAY POPULATION ALONE HAS GREATLY DECREASED. FOR MANY REASONS THE BEST OF WHICH IS THAT ACTUAL YOUTH CRIME IS SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN AND HAS BEEN FOR TWENTY YEARS. FOR TWENTY YEARS YOUTH SERIES YOUTH CRIME IS DROP DROP DROP DROP. AND SORE DJJ POPULATION IS DOWN THERE ALSO OTHER ON POLICIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ENACTED THAT IS REDUCE THAT POPULATION BUT OUR POPULATION IN THE COUNTIES IS SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN TO THE POINT. WHERE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART YOU'LL SEE THERE ARE MANY CONTIES FOR HOLDING ONLY FIVE YOU [inaudible] NOW [inaudible] IRONICALLY. A RECENT OUR INVESTIGATIVE REPORT BY THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE SHOW THAT WE HAVE COUNTIES THAT ARE SPENDING. IT DID. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY K. AND A BUFF ALAMEDA COUNTY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY ON THE HOLDING OF USE. US IN A CLEAR COUNTY THE DOCTOR'S OWN COUNTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR HOLDING YOUTH. SO THERE ARE VERY FEW COUNTIES FOR WHOM THAT THE COST TO THEM WOULD BE LESS. THAN THIS COST THAT WE WOULD NOW BE RACING. SO IT'S I GUESS WHAT I'M REYES IS I'M NOT SURE IF IT WILL CREATE THE FISCAL INCENTIVES THAT WE QUITE HOPE. BUT I CERTAINLY THINK IT IS LEGITIMATE TO DO SO BECAUSE CERTAINLY WE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN THE SITUATION WHERE WE WERE. AS WE HAVE. ONLY BE EXPECTING A TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND BECAUSE THEN THAT WOULD REALLY HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT MOTIVATION TO SEND MORE USED TO DJJ GIVEN THE COST. THAT OUR WN COUNTIES ARE SPENDING. BUT I THINK WHAT IT RAISES IS THAT [inaudible] OBVIOUSLY. WE ARE WE NO -- THAT. BY REMOVING YOUTHS FROM PROXIMITY TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE DON'T IMPROVE OUTCOMES BUT WHAT. WE SEE NOW IS THAT ARE COUNTY FACILITIES EVEN ARE NOT NECESSARILY GIVING US GREAT OUT COMES. AND THAT IT MAY BE JUST THE ENTIRE. HOLDING OF YOUTH IN A ARE CALLED A PUNITIVE SETTING. DOES NOT PROVIDE. THE TYPE OF WORK. THAT THE YOUTH NEED TO BE ABLE. TO TO ADDRESS WHATEVER ISSUES CAUSE THEM TO TO ENGAGE IN THE BEHAVIOR THEY ENGAGED WHICH THEN COULD. LEAD US TO A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE POTENTIALLY WOULD HAVE USED THAT ARE NOT. ON COMMITTING THOSE ACTS AND THE THE DATA WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT JUST BY VIRTUE OF BEING HELD EVEN IN A COUNTY FACILITY. YOUR LIKELIHOOD TO GO INTO AN ADULT FACILITY. INCREASES ITS I FORGET THE EXACT PERCENT BUT IT'S IN THE THIRTY YEAR PERCENT OR WATER SO SO ANYWAY. SO I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO GO BUT I THINK THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS WHOLE QUESTION. OF HOW WE DEAL WITH YOUTH AND YOUTH OFFENDERS -- BOTH DUE TO THE COST IN THE COUNTIES AND DUE TO THE WE'RE NOT ACHIEVING NOW COMES WE HAD WE HAD INTENDED AND I ARE. IT IS REMINISCENT OF SENATOR MITCHELL'S COMMENTS REGARDING OUR THINKING THAT CERTAIN OF OUR SENSES WOULD CREATE A A INCENTIVE OR A MESSAGE THAT. YOU KNOW -- TO SUPPRESS THAT ACTIVITY WHICH THEY HAVE NOT. IN SO SIMILARLY I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT WHETHER WE ARE ACHIEVING WHAT WE INTENDED TO WITH THE WAY THAT WE'VE EVEN DESIGNED. ANY OF OUR USE AT ADDRESSING YOUTH DEFENSES ESPECIALLY GIVEN HOW SIGNIFICANTLY. YOUTH CRIME IS DROPPED -- BUT WITHOUT SAID AS I INDICATED I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL THE FIRM. NHIáU DON'T SEE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR AND SENATOR BILL DO YOU WANT TO CLOSE AND THEN I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. OF YES WE'RE SPENDING THE HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND DEPARTMENT GIVING -- A YOUTH OFFENDER BLOCK GRANT TO COUNTIES. TO SERVE LOCAL USE THAT -- OTHERWISE WOULD BE COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE WE'RE ALSO GIVING A JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIME PREVENTION ACT. THE THIRTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN OUR BUDGET FOR AT RISK YOU WOULD JUSTICE INVOLVE YOU. AND WE'RE ALSO -- FUNDING LOCAL OFFENDER REHABILITATION FACILITY CONSTRUCTION FINANCING TO THE TUNE OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND CONSTRUCTION FOR FACILITIES. WERE ALSO -- WE HAVE A USE FOR INVESTMENT GRANT -- THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- TO SUPPORT OUR DIVERSION PROGRAMS. FOR YOU FOR THE LOW LOW LEVEL OFFENSES SO. AND WE HAVE A IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE FACILITIES ARE ONLY A THIRD FLOOR. AND WE HAVE FOUR FACILITIES WITH SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SIX SIX HUNDRED SIXTY ONE A YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR FACILITIES SO. WHERE WE HAVE THESE FACILITIES AS YOU SAID THAT ARE? HELP FOR A THIRD PHONE NINE AND WE'RE NOT EVEN IF WE'RE ENDING WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY ON THE OPERATING EXPENSES FOR ALL THAT AND THE SAME THING THAT THE ACTUAL SAME THINGS HAPPEN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL I MEAN. SO WE'RE WE'RE IN A IN A PLACE WERE. WE HAVE TO TRANSFORM THINGS AND AND THIS BILL GOES IN THAT DIRECTION SO. SO I ARE CHEN AYE VOTE ON THIS AND OF THE TRANSFORMATION ASTOR CURVE WE'RE SPENDING. WAY OVER. THE TYPES OF MONEY WE SHOULD BE SPENDING. ON THINGS THAT DON'T REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AS AN ADULT. I'M THERE'S A MOTION BEFORE US LED SEVERAL CALL. MOTION IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. RIGHT SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. MORE LIKE NO BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE JACKSON. JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL HIGH MORALE. WIENER. RIGHT I'M WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME MISSING MEMBERS BUT YEAH LOOKING GOOD. ALL RIGHT -- LET US MOVE NOW TO ITEM THIRTEEN SB THREE SIXTY EIGHT SENATOR ARE TO LETTER LIKE [inaudible] THIS GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. MADAM CHAIR IN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- I AM SO EXCITED TODAY THIS IS MY FIRST BILL AND BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER I JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL SENATORS WHO BEEN. SO HOSPITABLE AND AND AND EXTENDED YOUR FRIENDSHIP I APPRECIATE THAT. THIS IS MY FIRST BILL ALSO TODAY THIS BILL I PRESENT A SENATE BILL THREE SIXTY EIGHT SIGN TO EXPAND THE PROTECTIONS OF THE PEACE OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS. OF THE POOR BAR TWO OFFICERS IN MODIFIED COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE GREAT RECESSION FORCED THE CLOSURE OF COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES ADMINISTERED BY SMALL MUNICIPALITIES. THESE FACILITIES REMAIN CLOSED UNTIL TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN THE STATE BEGAN TO CON CONTRACT WITH IMPACTED MY DISPARITIES TO BEGIN RETROFITTING THE CLOSE FACILITIES. TO ACCOMMODATE THE RE OPENING OF THESE CORRECTIONAL CENTERS IN TWENTY TWELVE THE STATE ENACTED SENATE BILL. THIRTEEN FIFTY ONE TO CREATE NEW CLASSIFICATION OF PEACE OFFICERS THAT PERFORMED THE SAME DUTIES AT THE STATE CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS. THESE OFFICER DID THE SAME WORK AS THE OTHER PIECE BY PIECE OFFICERS IN THE STATE FACILITIES BUT WITH THE NEW NAME AND A NEW BRAND. HOWEVER THIS NEW CLASSIFICATION FOR OFFICERS. IN THE NEWLY CREATED MODIFIED COMMUNITY CORRECTION FACILITIES WOULD NOT AFFORDED NOT ADDED TO THE CALIFORNIA PLEASE THE POLICE OFFICER PROCEDURAL BILL OF RIGHTS. THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS IS AN OVERSIGHT THAT WE CAN FIX TODAY. BRING IN FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY TO ALL THOSE WHO DO THE MEN WHO DO THE WORK BOTH MEN AND WOMEN -- NEED TO BE TREATED FAIRLY IN EQUITY ACROSS THE BOARD. THE SPIRIT OF SENATE BILL THREE SIXTY EIGHT IT'S TO PROVIDE A FAIR APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO ALL DOING THE SAME WORK THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE -- THESE INDIVIDUALS DOESN'T CHANGE YOUR PAY -- DOESN'T HURT A CHANGER WORK DUTIES OR RESPONSIBILITIES. UP. OR ANY OTHER TITLE THEY MAY HAVE INSTEAD IT ENSURES THAT ALL THAT ARE DOING THE SAME WORK ARE TREATED EQUALLY AND FAIRLY ACROSS THE BOARD. SENATE BILL THREE SIXTY EIGHT IS NECESSARY DUE TO THE FACT THAT SOME ADMINISTRATORS IN THESE FACILITIES HAVE BEGUN PICKING AND CHOOSING THE SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT THESE PROTECTIONS APPLY. TO THIS ARBITRARY APPLICATION OF THE LAW IS COMPLETELY AGAINST WHAT THE STATE STANDS FOR AND SHOULD NOT BE A PRACTICE IN ANYWHERE IN OUR STATE FACILITIES. AGAIN FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY IS WHAT I'M SHOOTING. FOR BY INCLUDING THESE OFFICERS IN THE PEACE OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS WILL EXTEND TO THEM THE RIGHTS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE. AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO THEM SOME TIME AGO. AND THE SAME WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IS JUST SIMPLY A TOP A CHANGE OF TITLE. THIS EXPANSION IS ONLY FOR A FEW FACILITIES THAT FIT THIS DESIGNATION BUT WILL MAKE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. THAT WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME TODAY I WAS ASKED THE THAT IT NOT YOU HERNANDEZ BEER BUT HE'S JOB RUNNING A LITTLE LATE. SO I HAVE WITH US THE MEMBER THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA. AND JANET YOUR DAY AND IT CORRECTION OFFICER AND AND IN THESE FACILITIES. AND HER HUSBAND A BRADLEY TO OKAY A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER IN A FACILITY UNDER THE PEACE OPTION BILL OF RIGHTS. CHAU. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU CONSIDER THIS BILL IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL BE BALLOT TO SCALE BRING A QUALITY BACK TO IT. AND TREAT EVERYBODY FAIRLY SO IF I MAY. YES YOU MAY PROCEED GO AHEAD. HELLO. MY NAME IS SHANNON SHERRILL. I AM A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER AT THE MODIFIED COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN CHAPTER CALIFORNIA. THIS FACILITIES RUN BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT IS DIRECTLY CONTRACTED WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR INMATES WHO OTHERWISE. WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR IN OUR STATE MAINLINE PRISONS I HAVE WORKED AT THIS FACILITY FOR OVER TEN YEARS BEFORE AND AFTER REALIGNMENT. I AM A PROUD MEMBER OF THE CW A LOCAL NINE ONE TEN FACILITY BEGAN RECEIVING INMATES IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AFTER REALIGNMENT. THE FACILITY WAS DESIGNATED TO RECEIVE INMATES LARGELY TO HELP REDUCE THE POPULATION AT THE STATE PRISONS AND TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE. I AM HERE THIS MORNING TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SB THREE SIXTY EIGHT THIS BILL IS VERY NARROW AND WELL JUSTIFIED. WE HAVE PEACE OFFICER STATUS WE WORK WITH STATE INMATES EVERY OTHER OFFICER IN CALIFORNIA IN A SIMILAR POSITION WITH THE SAME RESPONSIBILITIES IS COVERED BY PIECE OFF THE BILL OF RIGHTS ACT. HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO OUR LABOR RIGHTS AT MC CS WE ARE IN A LEGAL LIMBO. OUR SUPERVISORS CAN DETERMINE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHETHER TO FOLLOW THE PROTOCOLS LAID OUT AND PRO BAR. THEY CAN EVEN PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH PIECES OF THE PEACE OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS TO FOLLOW WHICH MEANS THAT TIMES ARE CUTE ARE UNION MEMBERS ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO CONSULT WITH THEIR UNION REPRESENTATIVES. KNOW WHETHER STATE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS IN THIS SITUATION I HAVE WORKED AS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER FOR OVER TWENTY ONE YEARS AND IN EVERY FACILITY. AND AGENCY I'VE WORKED. PROBAR IS APPLIED SO THEY KNEW I KNEW MY RIGHTS. PROBAR SIMPLY PROVIDES CONSISTENCY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW SUPERVISORS HANDLE INTERNAL EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER DISPUTE. IT GIVES THE RULES FOR WHEN WE CAN COUNT CONSULT OUR UNION OUR LAWYERS AND HOW INTERROGATIONS CAN BE CARRIED OUT BY OUR SUPERVISORS. LABOR RIGHT SHOULD NOT BE GRANTED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. THIS GAP IN CURRENT LAW IS A RESULT OF HOW ARE CORRECTION OFFICER STATUS CAN CREATE WAS CREATED BY STATUTE WHEN REALIGNMENT OCCURRED OUR FACILITY WAS NOT OPERATIONAL. OUR CORRECTIONAL STATUS HAD NOT YET BEEN CREATED. IN THE FIRST YEAR OF REALIGNMENT THE STATE CAL STATE A CALIFORNIA CREATED THE MODIFIED CORRECTIONAL COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES THERE ARE FIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE WERE ALL LEFT OUT. OF THE PENAL CODE AND CREATED OFFICER CATEGORY MUST MADE AS PEACE OFFICERS AND SENT STATE PRISONERS ARE WAY. WHAT THEY NEGLECTED TO DO WAS SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT HE'S OFF THE BILL OF RIGHTS PROTOCOLS APPLY TO S. AS A RESULT I HAVE WITNESSED AND LESS KNOWLEDGEABLE WORKERS BE DENIED THEIR POBRE RIGHT? INSTEAD OUR SUPERVISORS AND ADMINISTRATORS SIMPLY MADE UP WHATEVER PROCEDURES THEY WANTED. WHEN INVESTIGATING AND I WORKER AT OFFICER THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER RELATIONS I HAVE SEEN SUPERVISORS WHO ARE ACTUALLY INVOLVED WITH THE ISSUE BEING INVESTIGATED BE PUT IN CHARGE OF THE INVESTIGATION? AND QUESTIONING OF EMPLOYEES. THIS IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE PRACTICE SINCE IT COULD LEAD TO COERCION INTIMIDATION AND WILL PREVENT THE FAX FROM COMING OUT. OF OUR BRAVE I PROVIDES A PROTOCOL TO ENSURE THAT ALL INVESTIGATIONS ARE NEUTRAL AND FREE IT FROM COERCION AND ABUSES OF POWER. IT CAN BE VERY INTIMIDATED FOR YOUNGER OFFICER TO BE INVESTIGATED BY AN OUT OF CONTROL SUPERVISOR WHO IS VESTED IN THE OUTCOME OF THE MATTER. IT IS NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE WITHOUT CLEAR PROBAR STATUS. WORKERS ARE FORCED TO GO TO COURT SIMPLY TO DETERMINE WHICH PROCEDURES WILL BE FOLLOWED CREATING TENSION CHAOS AND WASTING VALUABLE TIME AND RESOURCES. SB THREE SIXTY EIGHT WILL CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE AND PROVIDE CLEAR DIRECTION FOR SUPERVISORS TO FOLLOW AND IT WILL LET OUR UNION MEMBERS KNOW THE RULES THAT THEIR SUPERVISORS WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW. FOR THESE REASONS I ASK YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. MY NAME IS BRADLEY CHOATE I AM A CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISOR IN A CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON. I WORKED IN CORRECTIONS FOR SIXTEEN YEARS EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. MY SUPERVISORS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO FOLLOW POOL BAR. AS A SUPERVISOR MYSELF I HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO FOLLOW POOL BAR. I SHOULD ALWAYS MEANT I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT. I AM SHANNON'S HUSBAND OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE SHARED OUR DAILY EXPERIENCES WITH EACH OTHER IT IS FRUSTRATING TO KNOW THE WORKERS AT THE MCC APPS ARE FORCED TO UNDER. UNKNOWN LABOR RIGHTS FRANKLY DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE THAT WORKERS LIKE MY WIFE ARE FORCED TO GUESS WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE AND HAVE NO CLEAR ANSWER ON HOW THEYCAN ENGAGE OUR UNION OR SIMPLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO OFFICE SUPERVISORS TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF AN INTERNAL. EMPLOYEE INVESTIGATION. AS A SUPERVISOR IT IS BENEFICIAL FOR ME AND FOR EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT WE WILL FOLLOW. UP POOL BAR PROTOCOL. THE WORKERS KNOW THE RIGHTS WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH SUPERVISORS AND WE CAN HANDLE SENSITIVE EMPLOYEE MATTERS IN A PREDICTABLE AND ORGANIZED MANNER. I KNOW FIRST HAND THE POPE POPE OUR BRAINS AND IMPORTANT CERTAINTY TO A PROCESS THAT CAN OTHERWISE BEING MANIPULATED. IF AN OFFICER DOES SOMETHING WRONG HERE SEE SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO INTERNAL. PERSONAL ACTION HOWEVER IF HE OR SHE HAS NOT THERE SHOULD BE A CLEAR PROCESS TO SORT OUT THE SITUATION AND ASSURE THAT THE WORKER DOES NOT TAKE THE FALL FOR SOMEONE ELSE. INCLUDING AN OUT OF CONTROL SUPERVISOR. IT CAN GET VERY TENSE WORKING IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IT IS ALSO AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE SUPERVISORS. WHO GO UNCHECKED CAN INTIMIDATE WORKERS AND CREATE AN UNACCEPTABLE WORK ENVIRONMENT? SB THREE SIXTY OR CORRECTED OVERSIGHT. MADE WHEN HE'S CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WERE CREATED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THEY WANT TO JUST COME UP TO THE MIKE AND INDICATE YOUR NAME IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS LIZ SORENSON I AM THE POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT. NINE AND I'M STANDING IN SUPPORT BUT WE ALSO HAPPEN TO BE THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR SUPPORT WITH AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO YOUR SUPPORT. THEREFORE WITH THE CHAPTER COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS IS A SHADE IN SUPPORT THIS BILL. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I SEE AND TALK TO THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CITIES ALLIED WITH PUBLIC SAFETY. AND WE ARE POSTED THE BAIL IT WOULD ACTUALLY M. COST THE CITY TO HAVE THESE FACILITIES DELANO CAPTAIN CHAPTER THERE ARE ONLY. THREE AM OVER MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE CCR WHICH THE INMATES ARE CONTRACTED TO BUILD THEIR WAY PROVIDE THAT MANY IN THE CONTRACTS. THESE THIS BILL WAS ALSO INTRODUCED BY RUDY SALAS AB. TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO AND IT WAS DEFEATED. AND THIS INFORMATION IS ALREADY INCLUDED IN CODE SECTION THIRTY THREE HUNDRED SO WE THINK IT'S REDUNDANT IT'S NOT NECESSARY. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE SPONSORS THE BILL TO TRY TO WORK SOMETHING OUT BUT WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL FOR THESE REASONS -- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- CENTER MORE LOCKED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR. I JUST HAVE YOUR FIRST BILL I I GUESS MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE WHAT WOULD THE COST BE AND WE'VE JUST BEEN TOLD TO MILLION DOLLARS I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT. PARALLELS YOUR CAN YOUR YOUR YOUR ESTIMATE OF THE COST WELL I I AM UNDER THE IMPRESSION THERE IS NO SUCH COST OF LIFE THAT RECURS REMEMBER. IT JUST LIKE ALL OF US HERE AS CENTERS WILL HAVE THE EQUAL RIGHT PEOPLE SAY CALL VOTE. IN THIS IS WHAT I'M ASKING FOR THESE -- CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS TO BE ABLE TO BE UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF A PROBAR SO THEY HAVE THE EQUAL RIGHTS AS EVERYONE ELSE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT -- THAT THAT'S ALL IT IS -- THE THE THE OPPOSITION NEVR SPOKE TO ME ABOUT ANY OPPOSITION BUT THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL SITUATION IT IS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EQUAL RIGHTS -- TO BE ABLE TO BE REPRESENTED EQUALLY AND FAIRLY ACROSS THE BOARD THERE ARE MEN AND WOMEN THAT DATA I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS SCALE IS NOT ALWAYS EVEN BUT THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY. TO COME BACK AND DO WHAT WE PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE DONE YEARS AGO WHEN THIS THIS THING STARTED. THE FACILITIES ARE THERE. BUT THE WORK IS THE SAME THIS IS WHAT I'M IF THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING. WHEN WHEN -- BUT ALL OF US ARE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN WHAT WE DO WE DO IT WITH THE THE SPIRIT OF FAIRNESS TO QUALITY ACROSS THE BOARD THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL IS IS DOING THAT'S ALL IT IS. IS IT'S NOT A PAY INCREASE IS NOT CHANGING ANYBODY'S TITLE IT'S NOT CREATED SUPERVISORS IT'S NOT CREATING CHANGE OF DUTY STATIONS. IT IS JUST FAIRNESS THAT WE'RE LOOKING [inaudible] FOR WITHIN. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS MILLION DOLLARS. I I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT FIGURE CAME FROM FROM. BUT IF IF THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATIONS OF COURSE NOT. CENTURY STATE SENATOR I'M I'M SURE YOU WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO PERSONALLY MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE OF A MILLION DOLLARS CORRECT. WELL I'M GONNA GO TO YOUR BANK AND ASK FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. OF THAT SENATOR JACKSON ASKED ME TO HAYES YOU FREE ALL THANK YOU. I I WAS. I WAS PRETTY. I WAS PRE WAR AND THAT IS YOUR FIRST BILL SENATE ARCHULETA SOMEONE IS GONNA HATE YOU LITTLE BIT AND I AND I TAKE THE SPIRIT. AND AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT. THE SENATOR THANK YOU MADAM CENTER WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR -- SO. MY VIEW IS. THAT WHO BORE BORE IS THE PLACE UP I HATE THAT PHRASE PLEASE OFFICE A BILL RIGHT -- IS MORE ABOUT WHAT IS COVERED VAN WHICH OFFICERS ARE OR NOT. I IN A AND LAST TIME THIS BILL WAS OUT -- IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO AND SINCE THEN WAS WHAT IS ONE THING THAT IS CHANGES THAT UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHAIR. WE PASSED SENATE BILL -- FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE DIED PROVIDED SOME MUCH NEEDED REFORM -- FOR WHAT WAS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF SERIOUS COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUSTAIN THAT I WAS HAPPY TO SUPPORT THAT -- I DON'T THINK THE I SUPPORTYOUR BILL BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE SO. IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN PEOPLE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT WHETHER IT SHOULD EXIST AT ALL OR OR OR WHATEVER. BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IT LEAVING OUT ONE CLASS OF OFFICERS ARE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME SO -- I UNDERSTAND WHY -- THIS DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD WHEN. FREE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHEN. TRULY THE SYSTEM WAS BROKEN IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS BEING -- HELD FROM THE PUBLIC -- BUT WITHOUT REFORM -- UNCOMFORTABLE -- CHEAPNESS [inaudible] THANK YOU. CERTAINLY SENATOR MITCHELL. I APPRECIATE YOUR REFERENCE TO FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE I'VE JUST. SINCE THE SKINNER IS HERE UGH. MY RECENT UNDERSTANDING IS FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE REALLY ISN'T BEING. IMPLEMENTED FAIRLY EQUALLY EQUALLY ACROSS THE STATE IS THAT A FAIR ASSESSMENT A SKINNER AT THE PRESENT MOMENT YES THAT'S A FAIR ASSESSMENT THANK YOU. I'M SURE GENERAL YES I YOU AND I HEARD ON THE YES AND I AND I AM -- I AGREE I DON'T AGREE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S POSITION I I AM -- WORLD FRUSTRATED BY THAT BUT I GOT WILL RESOLVE ITSELF IN THE RIGHT WAY. ALL RIGHT -- I WILL NOW ADD MY A SOME COMMENTS -- FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WAS ONLY A MODEST IT MOSTLY. IT DID. HAVE A MEMBER TO PROBAR BUT ITS PRIMARY MEMBERS FOR THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT -- I APPRECIATE I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE CATEGORY OF EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD% LIKE THAT FEEL THAT THIS THEIR EXCLUSION. HAS TREATED THEM UNFAIRLY AND AS A PERSON WHO -- ORGANIZE THE A UNION -- BECAUSE I FELT THAT THE CATEGORY AT THAT I WORKED IN AT THAT TIME WAS NOT BEING TREATED FAIRLY AND WE SUCCEEDED SO I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THAT. MY DIFFICULTY RIGHT NOW. I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THIS BILL. IS THAT IN IN THIS IN GIVEN THE COMMENTS THAT SENATOR WIENER MADE IT SORT OF YOU KNOW IT'S AN ONE COULD SAY WELL LOOK I SHOULD JUST ALLOW. THOSE OFFICERS WHO HAVE -- WOULD NORMALLY BE IN THIS -- GIVEN OUR PAST ACTIONS. TO YOU KNOW HAVE THE SAME THE SAME RIGHTS. MY PROBLEM THOUGH IS IF BY COULD REDO -- POLE BARN OF COURSE ANY OF US COULD INTRODUCE IT BUT IT'S THE DIFFICULT -- IT'S A DIFFICULT BILL TO OPEN UP BUT I FEEL THAT. IN THE STATE'S. USE OF IT TOWARDS OUR OFFICERS WERE IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES THAT THERE ARE TWO PROVISIONS IN KHOBAR THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC. THAT I THINK PERHAPS ONE WAS NOT FULLY DEBATED OR UNDERSTOOD. WHEN IT WAS EXTENDED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN? WHO ARE CUSTODIAL OFFICERS AND THOSE TWO ARE THE ISSUES AROUND? THE PROHIBITION OF SEARCHING OF LOCKERS AND PERSONAL. I'M JUST BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF WHEN YOU'RE A CUSTODIAL OFFICER IN THE IN. YOU KNOW NOT MAKING ANY KIND OF BLANKET STATEMENT THE CAN STUDIO OFFICERS ARE THE SOURCE OF CONTRABAND IN -- FACILITIES BUT SINCE THAT IS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY WITHOUT THAT ABILITY I THINK IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT. THEN SOME OF OUR OTHER CATEGORIES OF OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER PROBAR I THINK ADDITIONALLY. THE PROHIBITION OF THE USE OF A POLYGRAPH OR LIE DETECTOR AND THE RULES AROUND INTERROGATION. THAT [inaudible] WHILE. MARCUS THIRTY OFFICERS ARE ENGAGED IN A TEN CARE CATION THAT MUCH THE FEW TIMES THEY ARE. IN OTHER WORDS IT'S JUST THERE A DIFFERENT CATEGORY. OF THEIR THEIR ROLES ARE DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF OUR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. SO IF I HAD THE WHOLE ISSUE OF ALLOWING ANY CUSTODIAL OFFICERS IN PROBAR AS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE COMFORTABLE. SO. FOR TODAY EVEN THOUGH I AND I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THIS AS I INDICATED AND I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S NOT. FAIR IN FACT TO HAVE. OFFICERS. AND DO THE SAME JOB IN EFFECT TO BE UNDER IT AND THEN OTHER OFFICERS NOT -- I AM I AM GOING TO STAY OFF THE BILL TODAY. SO -- I WANTED TO EXPLAIN WHERE AND AND I WAS ON GRAPPLING WITH IT LATE LAST NIGHT AGAIN THIS MORNING -- BUT THAT'S WHAT I PERSONALLY HAVE CONCLUDED. ON ANYWAY SO I'M NOT I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING BUT I WILL BE VOTING NO. SO LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BEFORE ASK THE AUTHOR TO CLOSE. OKAY CENTER YES GIVEN THAT EVERYONE'S COMMENTING ON THIS WHY THEY'RE VOTING I FEEL COMPELLED TO SHARE I AM GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS -- THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT POLL BAR I THINK MAYBE WE NEED TO REVISIT IT BUT I CANNOT SEE WHY WE WOULD. REQUIRE. MOST PEOPLE TO BE UNDER IT AND NOT OTHERS SO FOR THE PURPOSES OF UNIFORMITY. ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK WE COULD TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT PO BAR FOR SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED BUT THE BILL AS I UNDERSTAND IT. IS JUST SIMPLY INCLUDING THIS GROUP UNDER THOSE SAME RULES AND REGULATIONS SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL ALTHOUGH I DO HOPE THAT WE WILL REVISIT. SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF A BAR. A CENTER MITCHELL. I HAVE A QUESTION BECAUSE I I DO HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT POOL BAR AND AND AND DO YOU THINK IT COMPLICATES OUR ABILITY TO EVER OPEN IT UP AND REYES SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU. YOU RAISED IF WE CONTINUE TO ADD CLASSES OF PEOPLE TO IT I'M. FOR ME IT WAS A INTERNAL CONSISTENCY SO THAT'S WHY I CONCLUDED THAT BUT CERTAINLY THE DIFFICULTY OF OPENING FOUR BAR UP REMAINS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NONE OF PEOPLE YES WILL PULL THAT ALL RIGHT OKAY. I MEAN SENATOR JACKSON WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND I COULD HAVE SAID WHAT SHE JUST STATED JUST AS EASILY. SO I WANT I WANT THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS AND THE OFFICERS IN AFFECTED TO KNOW THAT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I A YOU KNOW THIS IS A AT HOME I FEEL VERY CONFLICTED ABOUT IT -- BUT JUST FOR MY OWN. BILL ANY FOR INTERNAL CONSISTENCY I WON'T BE BUT I CERTAINLY I COULD HAVE MADE. THE SAME ARGUMENT THAT CENTER JACKSON AND OTHERS MADE SO JUST WANTED TO BUT CENTER MITCHELL GO AHEAD. I WAS MY QUESTION THAT YEAH THAT SINCE WE ALL AGREE THAT POLL BUT NOT ALL SOME OF US AGREE THAT WHOLE BAR IS IN NEED OF A REVIEW. I JUST WONDER IF WE WILL EVER GET TO THAT POSITION IF. CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE ADDED TO IT IF IF THAT WILL MAKE THAT CONVERSATION ALL THE MORE COMPLICATED I GUESS THAT WITH ONLY. LIKE I SAID WE WILL HAVE YET ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE POTENTIALLY OPPOSE ANY CHANGES. TO THE NEW PROTECTIONS THAT THEY WILL HAVE GAINED IF THIS BILL WERE TO BECOME LAW THAT WAS I WOULD. ALL RIGHT CENTER ARTILLERY LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU AND IF YOU'RE IN THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WHEN WE'RE TALKING BUT FAIR AND SHE QUALITY AND I THINK WHEN THIS THIS THING STARTED. NOBODY ACTUALLY REALIZED EQUAL WORK EQUAL PAY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY THIS IS ONE THAT WE CAN CORRECT TODAY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WHAT IF WE WERE TALKING. ABOUT WOMEN DOING A CERTAIN THING OR MEN DOING A CERTAIN THING BUT AS I'VE EXPRESSED IN AND IN THE PAST IN THE MILITARY IT'S LEVELED OFF IN THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FOR US TO DO THESAME THING. WE GOT A LEVEL OFF THE PLAYING FIELD IN EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE EQUAL RIGHTS EQUAL SAY AND EQUAL PROTECTION. AND THAT'S THE IDEA AND THIS IS WHY THIS IS COME FORWARD NOW AS I MENTIONED THERE THERE'S NO REASON WHY ONE SHOULD A SUPERVISOR. SHOULD TREAT SOMEONE DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEONE ELSE. WHEN IF WE'RE ALL UNDER THE SAME UMBRELLA IN THE RULE OF LAW? THEN EVERYONE CAN GO RIGHT TO THE RULE BOOK AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WAS DONE RIGHT THIS IS WITH DONE WRONG WE CAN ALL IT HERE TO IT. SO THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN BALLOTS TO SCALE IN OTHER THINGS TO DO IN THE FUTURE PROBABLY SO. IS YOUR THINGS TO DO TO DO -- I WOULD IMAGINE AT BUT I THINK THIS IS THE DOOR OPENER THAT WILL BRING US BACK TOGETHER SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE GOT TO TREAT EVERYONE FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE DOING THE SAME JOB AT THE SAME PAY AND THE SAME LOCATION. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR BIBLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLOSE LET'S SEE IF THERE'S A MOTION. RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL. BOXING ANY MORE COMMENTS WE WILL TAKE A ROLL CALL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER MORE LOCK [inaudible] BRADFORD. JACKSON JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL I AM AROUND. MORRELL AYE WIENER. WIENER HIGH. SO W WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN THERE ARE. ENOUGH VOTES FOR PASSAGE BUT WE HAVE SOME MISSING MEMBER SO WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN. AND THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND CENTER TO LET YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL. SO YES I DO SEE THAT -- SB. FIVE SEVENTEEN YES SIR -- THIS IS A BILL THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS -- ENTERTAIN IN THE PAST. DID. SO -- HOPEFULLY KNOWING THAT WE HAVE SUPPORTED IN THE PAST WOULD ALLOW US TO MOVE. DISHES LEE ON THIS ONE SO THAT -- WE CAN PROCEED WITH OUR OTHER BILLS AND STILL CONCLUDE BY CAUCUS TIME [inaudible] GO AHEAD. ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND A COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THIS BILL SENATE BILL -- FIVE SEVENTEEN HITS HOME WITH ME A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER FOR MAYOR OF A CITY I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE. THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO DO THIS PARTICULAR JOB AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR SAFETY -- TODAY I PRESENT SENATE BILL FIVE SEVENTEEN THE BILL IS VERY FILM BARELY FAMILIAR TO THE COMMITTEE I'M SURE. IN FACT LAST YEAR -- THE IDENTICAL BILL WAS CARRIED BY CENTER GALGIANI AND THAT PASSED. OF THE COMMITTEE WITH NO NO VOTE. THIS BILL FIVE SEVENTEEN WILL EXPAND A LICENSE PLATE CONFIDENTIALITY TO INCLUDE CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS PARKING CONTROL OFFICERS AND PROVIDE THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT APPLIED TO THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT COLLEAGUES. CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND PARKING CONTROL OFFICERS ENGAGE IN WORK THAT EXPOSES THEM. TO SITUATIONS THAT -- RETALIATION IS IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION. BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE TO THAT SOME PEOPLE -- PUT ON THE TABLE IN AN EXPRESS -- THE CONCERN FOR THEIR SAFETY IS IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT. AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE ALWAYS CONCERNED AS THEY ARE AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE -- BOTH THESE GROUPS IN JUROR THREATS ASSAULTS AND SOME HAVE EVEN BEEN MURDERED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. AT PRESENT MANY CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND PARKING CONTROL OFFICERS DO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES INFORMATION SEALED FROM OPEN ACCESS BUT NOT ALL. THAT WAS IT I'M TRYING TO DO LET'S BRING IT ACROSS THE BOARD ALL. SOME CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN PARKING CONTROL OFFICERS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THESE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS. THAT IN THAT EXPLOSION IS LIFE THREATENING IN SOME CASES AND CAN HAVE SOME DIRE CONSEQUENCES. THIS BILL FIVE SEVENTEEN WILL INCLUDE BOTH CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THE PARKING CONTROL OFFICERS UNDER THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT CURRENTLY APPLY TO THEIR COLLEAGUES IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOAT THANK YOU THEY ARE GOT. SORRY BEFORE I GO TO YOUR WITNESS IS A JUST WANT TO REMIND -- THE WITNESSES AND COMMITTEE THERE'S NO KNOWN OPPOSITION THE COMMITTEE HAS SUPPORTED THIS BILL IN THE PAST SALUTE -- JUDICIAL STATE BILL OKAY I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH THAT IN THE WINDOWS SYSTEM AND THAT JOSH JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND I HAVE TWO WITNESSES TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS GREAT. YOU CAN CERTAINLY SAY YOUR NAME AND SUPPORT OF THE BILL IT'S PERFECTLY LEGIT. GOOD MORNING VERY CHAIRMAN CHIEF OF CODE ENFORCEMENT FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK. MY NAME IS CARL SIMPSON ON THE CODE HOUSING FOR CITY FOR THE CITY SACRAMENTO AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE HEAD CENTER I AM MORE LIKE AT QUESTION FOR VûI [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SECOND. ONE ALRIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION. AND TAKE YOUR PREVIOUS COMMENT OF ASKING US TO SUPPORTED IF YOU'RE CLOSE TO THAT YES AND I'LL MAKE A VERY SHORT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FAVORITE VOTE THANK YOU -- THEN WE WILL HAVE A ROLL CALL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MORE LOCKED. OR LIKE I BRADFORD. JACKSON JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MITCHELL AYE MORALE WIENER. WIENER AYE. GREAT YOUR BILL WILL BE HELD OPENED RIGHT NOW ROLL CALL JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE MISSING MEMBERS BUT IT'S LOOKING FIND SEVERAL GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PRESENTING YOUR FIRST TWO BILLS WE APPRECIATE IT AND WE WILL NOW MOVE -- TO YOU'RE FINISHED YEAH -- THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME WE'LL NOW MOVE TO SENATOR JACKSON'S -- WILL KNOW WE COULD MOVE TO SENATOR. WINNERS I'M SORRY. GO AHEAD SENATOR JACKSON'S YOU'VE GOT ONE HE'S GOT TO SO WE'LL GO TO SB FIFTY FIVE SENATOR JACKSON AND THEN WE'LL GO TO SENATOR WINNERS OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. JUST AS GOOD [inaudible] NUMBER [inaudible] YEAH. OKAY I DON'T KNOW. THERE WERE MISTER WITHIN HOW MUCH TIME. THEN HOW MUCH TIME -- TO CENTER JACKSON PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MATT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- BRING TO TODAY SB FIFTY FIVE THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL PROHIBIT PEOPLE WHO ARE IKELY TO ABUSE FIREARMS. FROM POSSESSING THEM. DRAWING ON RESEARCH THAT SHOWS A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN CERTAIN ALCOHOL AND DRUG RELATED CONVICTIONS AND FUTURE GUN VIOLENCE. THIS MEASURE ADD SEVERAL CRIMES TO THE LIST OF CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS THE RESULT IN A TEN YEAR PROHIBITION ON FIREARMS OWNERSHIP AGAIN THE GOAL HERE IS JUST TO REMOVE FIREARMS FROM PEOPLE. FORM WHOM OF RESEARCH SHOWS A CORRELATION BETWEEN. VARIOUS TYPES OF CRIME AND THE POTENTIAL OF IN FUTURE USE OF FIREARMS IN THE COMMISSION OF OTHER ACTS GOING FORWARD FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THIS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE. SO I WILL BE TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS I UNDERSTAND CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIALLY TARGETED COMMUNITIES -- BY REMOVING OF THOSE OFFENSES OF ALCOHOL ABUSE. I I BELIEVE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM AND A I I UNDERSTAND A MOCK UP OF HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED -- TO THE MEMBERS AND I APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK ON THAT ISSUE. THESE AMENDMENTS HAVE REMOVED AGAIN CONVICTIONS FOR PUBLIC INTOXICATION. OF FROM THE LIST OF MISDEMEANOURS RESULTING IN A FIRE ON PRO HERE -- PROHIBITION AND CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR RECEIVING A DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE FIREARM PROHIBITION. FROM TWO CONVICTIONS IN THREE YEARS TWO THREE CONVICTIONS IN TEN YEARS A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BUT WITH THESE AMENDMENTS BOTH THE ACLU AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION. AGAIN IT'S DOES NOT CREATE NEW CRIMES. IT JUST SIMPLY IDENTIFIES THROUGH THE RESEARCH AND WE DO HAVE A TESTIMONY HERE TODAY THAT SHOWS THAT CORRELATION -- BETWEEN OF THESE KINDS OF OFFENSES AND SUBSEQUENT USE OF FIREARMS. WE ARE AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA GUN LAWS. FOCUS ON PEOPLE LIKELY TO ABUSE FIREARMS AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ARGUABLY -- AGAIN PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED A PROPENSITY. WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THESE ARE INDEED VERY EFFECTIVE GUN VIOLENCE REDUCTION TOOLS TO TAKE FARMS AWAY FROM THESE FOLKS. RATHER THAN FOR BID BOTH RESPONSIBLE AND AND YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS FROM POSSESSING FIRING. TO THESE LAWS ONLY TARGET THOSE WHO HAVE SHOWN BY THEIR PAST BEHAVIOR. THAT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO MISUSE FIREARMS GOING FORWARD UNDER EXISTING LAW FELONS AND PERPETRATORS OF CERTAIN VIOLENT IN GUN RELATED MISDEMEANORS. ARE PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING FIREARMS AND I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR HAS ALSO WORKED VERY CLOSELY ON RESTRAINING ORDERS RELATED TO PEOPLE WITH THAT PROPENSITY -- SOME PROHIBITIONS ARE FOR A LIFETIME OTHERS FOR FIVE OR TEN YEARS OR DURING THE PERIOD WHILE A RESTRAINING ORDER OR A MENTAL HEALTH RESTRICTION. IS IN FORCE -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE THEN COLLEAGUES SENATOR LOIS WOKE I WAS ABLE TO GET APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR THE CREATION OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE ARM. VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER AT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DAVIS. RECENT RESEARCH FROM THE CENTER HAS REVEALED AN IMPORTANT LINK BETWEEN A CONVICTION FOR AN ALCOHOL RELATED CRIME AND LATER FIREARM ABUSE WE ARE TAKING RESEARCH THAT IS FINALLY BEING CONDUCTED. TO BE ABLE TO PINPOINT THE GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF FIREARM USE WE HEAR FROM THOSE WHO OPPOSE FIREARM REGULATION THAT YOU'RE. TAKING FIREARMS AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GOING TO ARE LIKELY TO BE USING THEM. THIS IS A MEASURE THAT IDENTIFIES WHO THE PEOPLE ARE WHO ARE LIKELY TO USE THEM TO TRY TO PROTECT AGAINST THAT KIND OF MISUSE GOINGFORWARD. THIS MEASURE TRANSLATES THESE RESEARCH FINDINGS IN THE PUBLIC POLICY IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT FUTURE GUN VIOLENCE SO THIS BILL ADDS THESE RESEARCH CORRELATED TO CONVICTIONS TO THE LIST OF TEN THE TEN YEAR PROHIBITION. THEY ARE POSSESSION WITH INTENT TO SELL CERTAIN CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER WHILE INTOXICATED AND DRIVING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL IT IS A TEN YEAR PROBATION AGAIN IN RECOGNITION OF THE RESEARCH THAT INDICATES THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF CRIMES BUT HAVE NOT CAN BE A COMMITTED ANY NEW CRIMES. FOR A TEN YEAR PERIOD HAVE ABOUT THE SAME LIKELIHOOD OF COMMITTING A FIREARM OFFENSE AS THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED ANY CRIMES. RESEARCH PINPOINTED TRYING TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM TO GET FIREARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE IN ALL OUR COMMUNITIES WHO WOULD BE LIKELY TO USE THEM. AND THIS MEASURE IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT SENATOR WOKE BROUGHT -- WHICH PASSED THROUGH BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE IN -- TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH SUPPORT OF SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IRONICALLY THE BILL WAS VETOED BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR SAID AT THAT TIME WE DON'T HAVE ANY RESEARCH. WE HAVE THE RESEARCH WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THAT RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THIS WILL HELP TO SAVE LIVES AND DO SO IN A WAY THAT IS DEMONSTRATED BY. THE GOOD HARD WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY -- THE DIRECTOR OF THE VIOLENCE PREVENTION RESEARCH PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS DOCTOR GEREN WENT WENT TO MUTE. AND WE ALSO HAVE WITH US HERE FROM THE ALAMEDA DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THE GREAT DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY -- MAIL SO WE'LL HAVE YOUR TO WITNESSES THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED AS GIVE US THEIR TESTIMONY AND THEN OTHER WITNESSES WILL JUST SAY NAME AND SUPPORT FOR IT. PRETTY GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. A SENATOR JACKSON DID TALK ABOUT THEIR RESEARCH WHICH GIVES US GREAT GUIDANCE. IN SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THAT THE BILL OULD AS A CENTER JACKSON SAID WILL PROHIBIT FIREARMS FOR HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS. AND IT'S REALLY ACCEPTING THE APPROACH TO PREVENT AN ACCEPTED APPROACH TO COULD TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE AND AS WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE TOO MUCH GUN VIOLENCE. IN OUR STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY. THE BILL IS IS QUITE FOCUSED ON THOSE WHO COMMIT GUN VIOLENCE AND WHAT OUR EXPERIENCE AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT. I HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH RUN GUN VIOLENCE AND WE PUBLISHED REPORT ON GUN VIOLENCE. BOTH IN THE STATE IN AN ALAMEDA COUNTY. AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THERE ARE. GENERALLY FOUR CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN MULTI AND MASK ON VIOLENCE OUR GUN VIOLENCE. ARE ONE IS MENTAL ILLNESS ONE OF THEM IS PEOPLE THAT FALL IN AN EMOTIONAL STATE AND THAT INCLUDES PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL ABUSE ISSUES ARE DRUG ABUSE ISSUES. OF THOSE WHO SEEK NOTORIETY LIKE MASS KILLERS AND ALSO THOSE WHO ARE WHO ARE USING FIREARMS OUT OF REVENGE OR ANGER. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THOSE AT HIGH RISK UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD LEAVE THEM IN AN ALTERED STATE EITHER BECAUSE OF MENTAL ILLNESS DRUGS OR ALCOHOL ABUSE. AND BY VIRTUE OF THE MULTIPLE CONVICTION REQUIREMENT THAT THIS BILL IT INCLUDES THERE IS A TRACK RECORD. THAT -- THAT IS A MUST BE ESTABLISHED FOR THOUGH CRIMES BEING ADDED TO THE STATUTE. THERE IN THE RESEARCH AS SENATOR JACKSON SAID SUPPORTS THE ADDED CRIMES A TO THIS BILL I WILL ALSO SAY THAT NOT ONLY AM I HERE ON BEHALF OF THE MY OFFICE AND A AND THE WORK THAT WE DO AROUND GUN VIOLENCE AND GUN PREVENTION. GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION BUT I'M ALSO ON THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PROSECUTORS AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE WHICH IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION. OF PROSECUTORS ARE TWO CHAIRS ARE CYRUS VANCE THE PROSECUTOR MANHATTAN. AND MIKE FEWER THE CITY ATTORNEY FOR LOS ANGELES. AND OTHER PROSECUTORS GUNS VIOLENCE ALSO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THE BEAUTY A RALLY FOR COMING CREATED. AND I'M DOCTOR CARE AND WHEN TO MUTE I AM DIRECTOR OF THE UC SENATOR THAT YOU SEE CENTER THAT SENATOR JACKSON. REFERRED TO I'M A PRACTICING EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN -- SENATOR JACKSON ASKED ME TO COME AND TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE THAT YOU'VE. REFERENCE TO WHEN A SIMILAR BILL WAS ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OF GOVERNOR BROWN VETO AS YOU MENTIONED -- FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT WE DID NOT HAVE GOOD SCIENCE ON THE FUTURE RISK FOR VIOLENCE AMONG LEGALLY AUTHORIZED PURCHASERS OF FIREARMS THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE WE NOW HAVE THAT SCIENCE I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT. TWO YEARS AGO WE PUBLISHED A STUDY OF LEGALLY AUTHORIZED PURCHASERS OF HAND GUNS HERE IN CALIFORNIA A PAST BACKGROUND CHECK WE WENT ALL THROUGH ALL THE HOOPS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE PEOPLE WHO HAD PRIOR CONVICTIONS FOR DIY AND OTHER ALCOHOL RELATED OFFENSES. WITH PURCHASERS WHO HAD NO CRIMINAL HISTORY AND THIS IS WHAT WE FOUND. AMONG THOSE WITH A DO YOU AYE HISTORY NEARLY A THIRD 33% WERE ARRESTED AFTER PURCHASING THEIR FIREARMS FOR A FIREARM RELATED OR VIOLENT CRIME. ONE IN SIX WAS ARRESTED FOR MURDER RAPE ROBBERY OR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT. EVEN AFTER STATISTICALLY ADJUSTING FOR DIFFERENCES IN POPULATIONS THEY WERE SIX TIMES AS LIKELY AS PURCHASERS WITH NO PRIOR CRIMINAL HISTORY TO BE ARRESTED FOR THOSE OFFENSES. AND WE HAVE JUST LITERALLY THIS WEEK I'M HAPPY TO FINALLY TELL YOU JEFF -- COMPLETED A MUCH LARGER STUDY OF AN ENTIRE YEAR'S WORTH OF HANDGUN PURCHASERS IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. A WITH FOLLOW UP FOR ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THEIR PURCHASES THE STUDY WILL BE GOING INTO THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE NEXT WEEK. IT HAS NOT GONE THROUGH PEER REVIEW YET SO I'M REALLY NOT AT LIBERTY TO GIVE THE DETAILS BUT I CAN TELL YOU IT FULLY SUPPORTS THE FINDINGS THAT I'VE JUST. MENTIONED FROM. OUR PUBLISHED RESEARCH WHAT'S MORE IS SENATOR JACKSON MENTIONED WE ALSO KNOW THAT SCREENING AND DENIAL OF FIREARMS PURCHASE. WORKS RESEARCH THAT WE DID THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE ON FIREARMS PURCHASERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. DETERMINED WHEN WHEN WE CHANGED OUR POLICY AND BEGAN PROHIBITING VIOLENT MISDEMEANORS FOR PURCHASING FIREARMS. THAT POLICY CHANGE THAT NEW PROHIBITION REDUCED THEIR RISK OF ARREST FOR A VIOLENT CRIME BY AFFECT PORTED MINISTRY OF WE APPLIED. POLICY. FINALLY AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THIS IS A VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED BILL. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE EACH YEAR RECEIVE A SECOND DO YOU AYE CONVICTION. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT ONLY A MINORITY OF THOSE CONVICTIONS OCCUR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY IN TIME TO THE FIRST AND THE TO HAVE TO BE CLOSE TOGETHER OR NOW THREE FOR THEM TO BE PROHIBITING. NUMBERTOO MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY PROHIBITED FOR OTHER REASONS MISDEMEANOR VIOLENCE AND SO FORTH AND FINALLY ONLY ABOUT ONE ADULT IN SIX IN CALIFORNIA ON TO FIRE. SO WHEN YOU ADD THOSE THINGS IN IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE ADDED TWO APPS BY THIS. IS ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED A YEAR. WE ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ESTIMATE THAT LARGE STUDY THAT I JUST MENTIONED OF AN ENTIRE YEAR'S WORTH OF HANDGUN PURCHASERS WE'VE LOOKED AT THE DATA. OF NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THAT STUDY FIFTEEN HUNDRED HAVE A DO YOU AYE CONVICTION ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED HAVE TWO OR MORE. THIS IS A VERY TIGHTLY FOCUSED BUILT ON A VERY HIGH RISK GROUP. I'LL MAKE ONE LAST POINT JUST VERY BRIEFLY OF THERE IS CONCERN THAT WE SHARE ABOUT DIFFERENTIAL APPLICATION OF THE LAW ACROSS GROUPS DEFINED BY RACE AND ETHNICITY WE HAVE LOOKED SPECIFICALLY. AT IN THAT LARGE STUDY AT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE Y. ACROSS SUBGROUPS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY AND WE FIND IT IN EVERY CASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL STOP THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO NOW WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WHO WANT TO GIVE THEIR A NAME AN AFFILIATION AND THEIR SUPPORT. DONNA SITES ARE VISITING LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT. HELLO SUSAN LEVIN BURKE HERE ON BEHALF OF AMANDA WILCOX -- WHO COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE SHE'S TESTIFYING IN WASHINGTON? CALIFORNIA RADIUS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. JIM LINDBERGH ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION IN CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. DANIEL CANDLE KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE DIFFERENCE LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE AND SUPPORT. MANY BED REPRESENTING SACRAMENTO VALLEY BRADY IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. ALRIGHT LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED WE HAVE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION WE APPRECIATE THE SENATOR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU. LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE HAVE ALSO REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. EXCELLENT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SO SEEING NONE LET'S SEE IF THERE'S QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER MITCHELL. THANKS THANK YOU FOR SHARING THE RESEARCH -- AND I MAY HAVE MISSED YOUR LASSEN REGARD TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BECAUSE THE ONE CONCERN I HAVE WITH THAT THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN. COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OVER POLICE THAT HAVE EXTRA -- D. Y. STOPS -- AND ALL OF THAT AND SO THE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CERTAIN UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR POOR COMMUNITIES. OF OF THE STOP ARE HIGHER THAN THE OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT'S THE REALITY. THE OTHER QUESTION IS IF YOU COULD JUST. TELL ME WHAT YOU WHAT THE RESEARCH REVIEW IF YOU CAN APART ON THAT MY SECOND QUESTION IS. IN THE MEMBERS POSSESSION FOR SALE OF SPECIFIED NARCOTICS WE CERTAINLY HAVE. I HAVE LEARNED IN GOING THROUGH -- PENAL CODE IN LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF OF OF POLICIES THAT YOU KNOW THE THE THE QUANTITY. THAT THE POSSESSION FOR SALE IS OFFERED IN THE EYES OF A COULD BE DETERMINED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY HAVE THE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE IF THEY THINK IT'S AN AMOUNT THAT'S FOR MY PERSONAL CONSUMPTION OR FOR SALE SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. THA THAT THAT'S TIGHT. AND THAT WE DON'T -- CONTINUE TO LEAVE THAT UP TO THE DISCRETION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU FOR BOTH THOSE QUESTIONS -- WE SHARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT DIFFERENTIAL ARREST RATES AND SO FORTH AND HAVE ALMOST COMPLETED A SEPARATE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA I'VE BEEN REFERRING TO SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THAT AND WE FIND. DIFFERENTIAL APPLICATION OF DO YOU AYE STATUTES IN CALIFORNIA -- WHICH IF YOU WILL CREATE A BIAS IN THE DATA AS THEY COME TO US. WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THAT BIAS SO WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO WAS WITH THE DATA IN FRONT OF US. DOES IT REMAIN THE CASE THAT FOR WHITE NON HISPANICS FOUR HISPANICS FOR NON HISPANIC AFRICAN AMERICANS WITHIN THE DATA. IS IT THE CASE THAT HAVING A PRIOR DUI CONVICTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK FOR VIOLENCE IN THE FUTURE. IF THE ARRESTS WERE IF IF YOU WILL COMPLETELY BOGUS WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T SEE THE INCREASE IN RISK. WE DO SEE THE INCREASE IN RISK FOR AFRICAN AERICANS IS ABOUT A FACTOR OF TWO POINT FIVE STILL A TWO HUNDRED AND 50%. INCREASE IN RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE D. Y. CONVICTION IN AN ANALYSIS JUST AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS. SIMILAR RESULTS -- FOR ANALYSES AMONG HISPANICS AND SO FORTH AND WE WILL BE PUBLISHING THAT INFORMATION AS WELL -- YOU I'M YOU'RE WELCOME WITH REGARD TO NARCOTICS. A BROADER POINT IS IT MANY MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE AWARE. THERE ARE MANY CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR WHICH WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN AN ORGANIZED EFFORT TO KEEP THE WORK FROM BEING DONE. RIGHT BEHIND THIS ALCOHOL STUDY IT USING THE SAME DATA WE'LL BE LOOKING WITHIN CALIFORNIA AT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG CONVICTIONS WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT WORK YET. BUT THE LITERATURE -- WILL SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING GENERAL STATEMENTS. THERE IS A VERY CLEAR ASSOCIATION BETWEEN STIMULANT USE AMPHETAMINES COCAINE ET CETERA AN INCREASED RISK IN EVERY POPULATION WHICH IT'S EVER BEEN LOOKED AT FOR OPIOIDS THE ANSWER IS MIXED FOR MARIJUANA THE ANSWER IS MIXED THERE ARE STUDY SHOWING. A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN RISK FOR VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH MARIJUANA USE NOT TODAY'S TOPIC. I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION FOR YOU ON THE SPECIFIC OFFENSES IN THE BILL. I HOPE TO WHEN WE GET THAT STUDY DONE [inaudible] THANK YOU. CENTER MORE LEFT THANK YOU MANAGER -- DOCTOR WENT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING YOUR ANSWERS ARE GETTING CLOSER TO WHERE I WANT TO GO. A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE MENTALLY ILL MOVIES REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE. HAVING GUNS AND ERROR. BUT THEY BUT THEY SELF MEDICATE. SO THROUGHOUT THE HALL THROUGH MARIJUANA THROUGH. ALL THE OTHER. STATE YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT WAS THERE A CORRELATION AT ALL COULD YOU SEE IN THE DATA THAT. MAYBE THAT EVEN IF THEY HAD A DO YOU WHY THEY WERE ALSO MENTALLY ILL. NO BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION IS NOT IN THE DATA -- WE ARE LOOKING AT RECORDS FOR GUN PURCHASING AN CRIMINAL RECORDS SO WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH DATA WE ARE WE WERE ALSO DOING AN EVALUATION OF THE APPS PROGRAM WITH SUPPORT FROM. DOJ AND FUNDING FROM AND I J. THERE WE WILL HAVE A LOOK AT A LARGER COMMENT AND IT'S ACTUALLY I I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE SIDE OF THIS. ONE OF THE I'M IN A SOME RICE RESEARCH BRIEFLY HERE. MENTAL ILLNESS EVEN SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS BY ITSELF. IS ASSOCIATED WITH A RISK FOR FUTURE VIOLENCE THAT'S SMALL ENOUGH. THAT NOT EVERY CAREFULLY DONE STUDY HAS EVEN FOUND IT TO BE THERE. WHAT HAPPENS IN AS IT DOES IN THE GENERAL POPULATION IS BAD MENTAL ILLNESS? TO A PRIOR HISTORY OF VIOLENCE TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND THEN THE RISK IN THE FUTURE GETS VERY HIGH BUT VIOLENCE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ARE RISK FACTORS. FOR FUTURE VIOLENCE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION SO ONE WAY AND I TEACH MY STUDENTS ABOUT THIS ONE WAY TO GET AT THE MENTAL ILLNESS PROBLEM IS TO GO AFTER SUBSTANCE ABUSE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY. I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THE LINKS HAVE TEN YEARS WAS SELECTED. THE DISSECT CLARIFICATION THERE ARE. TWO COMPONENTS THERE'S A THREE YEAR IN A TEN YEAR. SO THE THREE YEAR. SO THE IT OUT IN THE AMENDED BILL OKAY SO THE WE NEED IN THE AMENDED BILL. ONE WOULD HAVE TO BE HAVE TWO OR MORE CONVICTION. OF POSSESSION OF THOSE SPECIFIED NARCOTICS FOR SALE. SO YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE TWO OR MORE CONVICTIONS OF THAT WERE TO MORE CONVICTIONS OF THE GROSS VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER WHILE INTOXICATED. IN A THREE YEAR PERIOD. THE TEN YEAR PERIOD IS THREE OR MORE DO YOU ICE. SO MAYBE I'M NOT ASKING THE QUESTION CORRECTLY MADAM CHAIR -- WOULD WORK WERE SAYING YOU CANNOT APPLY FOR A OR PURCHASE A HANDGUN FOR TEN YEARS. A TEN YEARS THAT SIX EIGHT AND IT IS WE'RE JUST MODELING AFTER EXISTING LIE I JUST WONDERED IF THERE IS A HISTORY OF WHITE TO ADD SELECT YES THAT WAS THE REASON THAT WE LOOKED AT THE TEN YEAR I THINK ALSO THE RESEARCH INDICATED. THAT IF A PERSON IS -- CONVICTION FREE FOR A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS IT USUALLY IS AN INDICATION THEY'VE KIND OF GOTTEN THEIR LIFE BACK TOGETHER AGAIN SO WE AGAIN THE GOAL IS TO DEAL WITH THAT HIGH RISK ELEMENT VERY FOCUSED PINPOINTED. AND ALSO TO GET THE GUNS OUT OF THEIR HANDS AND NODDED AND ADDITIONAL CRIMINAL OFFENSE FOR WHICH THEY'RE GOING TO BE PUNISHED WHICH JUST KNOWING THAT THERE IS SAID GREATER PROPENSITY FOR THE USE OF FIREARMS. WHICH IS REMOVING ACCESS TO THEM FOR THAT FOR THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. IN CENTER JACKSON'S YOUR BILL UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA OR HAS IT BEEN TRIED YOU'RE DONE SOMEWHERE ELSE I BELIEVE THIS IS UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF THE FEW PLACES WHERE WE ACTUALLY ARE DOING. RESEARCH ON GUN VIOLENCE WHICH ISN'T INTO AN ART AN IRONY OF COURSE I KNOW THAT I BELIEVE THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL HAS STUFF MINIMAL -- BUT THERE'S BEEN -- UP. SADLY A OF A PUSH AGAINST KNOWLEDGE FUNNY AREA OF THIS KIND OF PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENT FIREARMS RELATED BEHAVIOR AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I BELIEVE IT WAS TWENTY FOURTEEN OR TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN. SENATOR WILK WAS ABLE TO GET THIS BILL PASSED AND FUNDED SO THAT THE RESEARCH COULD BE DONE AND THE UC DAVIS WAS A DESIGNATED FACILITY THAT WE ARE. NOW ACTUALLY ABLE TO DO THAT-RESEARCH I KNOW OTHERS HAVE TRIED AND BEEN SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL BUT THIS IS TRULY THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. THAT DEMONSTRATES THE KINDS OF BEHAVIOR FOR A LOT OF US IT'S BEEN INTUITIVE -- BUT THIS IS ACTUAL -- FACT BATES SCIENCE THAT HAS BEEN PEER REVIEWED AND ALL OF THOSE IMPORTANT MEASURES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO ASSURE THE ACCURACY OF THE DATA. THANK YOU CAN THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON THANK YOU. GREAT SO DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL. RIGHT ON THE THIRTY JACKSON AREA OF YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU FOR THE VERY BRIEFLY THIS IS FOR TARGETED THIS IS TO GET FIRE ARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WE KNOW ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE THEM. WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE -- I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN I THINK IT -- HELPS US ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS MEMBERS WHO SPOKE AND I HAD THE COMMITTEE HAD SO I APPRECIATE THAT THOSE WERE TAKEN. AND I FEEL LIKE IT IS THE AS CONCURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED IS BASED ON THE RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT WILL DO A ROLL CALL. I FIFTY PASSES AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MORE LOCK. BRADFORD BRADFORD AYE JACKSON JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MORRELL. BROWNELL WIENER WIENER AYE. RIGHT I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO HOLD THE BILL NOW RIGHT OKAY SO WE HAVE EVERYBODY HERE BILL PASSES THANK YOU -- WILL NOW GO TO CENTER WIENER SPILLS AND I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN CONCLUDE WITHOUT HAVING. TO RECONVENE AFTER CAUCUS AND I SENATOR WIENER I DON'T WANT TO NOT DO JUSTICE FOR YOUR BILLS BUT I HOPE THAT WE CAN PROCEED. AND I GO TO WITHOUT HAVING TO RECONVENE THE COMMITTEE HAS HEARD THEM BEFORE SO I WILL BE. VERY GOOD POINT YES YOUR BILL -- SB TWENTY THREE WE HAVE HEARD BEFORE YES ON THE OTHER ONE AS WELL. RIGHT KEEP IT ON AUTHOR -- WITH IT. YOU COULD IF YOU WANT IT. RIGHT GO AHEAD YOU HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL. OKAY -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- COLLEAGUES SB TWENTY THREE WAS PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. ODDS CO AUTHORED BY NINE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS ACROSS -- THE OFF ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. THIS BILL WILL HELP CLOSE A LOOPHOLE IN OUR AUTO BURGLARY -- STATUTE WHICH ARE CURRENTLY OF THESE AS INTERPRETED BY A NUMBER OF COURTS ARE REQUIRES SAID TO APPROVE AUTO BURGLARY -- IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO PROVE THAT SOMEONE BASHED IN A WINDOW YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE DOOR TO THE CAR WAS LOCKED WHICH IS OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DO PARTICULARLY -- IF A TOURISTS WAS INVOLVED THE RENTAL CAR WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH RENTAL CAR BREAK INS THAT TAURUSES GONE. OUR SOMEONE SIMPLY DOESN'T REMEMBER A AND SO FORTH SO -- THE BILL WILL -- ALLOW A CONVICTION -- BASED ON FORCIBLE ENTRY I DO WANT TO KNOW AND WE MADE THE CHANGE LAST YEAR WE'VE CP THAT. THE WAY WE ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED THE BILL AND THE REASON THIS IS A SEPARATE NEW CRIME WE ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED IT IS SIMPLY A MODIFICATION TO THE EXISTING. CRIME ABOUT DOT WOULD HAVE HAD THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF POTENTIALLY OF EXPANDING FELONY MURDER AND SO WE CREATED A NEW CRIME NOT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO CREATE A NEW CRIME WE WANTED TO CHANGE EXISTING. ONE WE CREATE A NEW CRIME IN ORDER TO AVOID EXPANSION OF FELONY. MURDER -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY IS MAX ALTHOUGH FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND BOARD NEW AND PRESIDENT AND CEO OF CAL TRAVEL WHO WILL PROVIDE BRIEF TESTIMONY. HI MAX ABA FROM THE DA'S OFFICE IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH ONE BIG CENTER WIENER FURS I CONTINUED SUPPORT LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AS YOU MENTIONED THE SASS SIMPLY CLOSE A LOOPHOLE WHILE IT DEFIES LOGIC THE FACT THAT A VICTIMS WINDOW -- WAS BROKEN DOES NOT BY ITSELF ESTABLISHED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS LOCKED -- SO IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT THE DOOR WAS LOCKED IN THAT AND THE FENDER -- BROKE THE WINDOW IN ORDER TO GAIN ENTRY WE OFTEN ASK VICTIMS TO COME BACK TO COURT TO TESTIFY. THIS PROVES EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT WHEN THE VICTIM IS A VISITOR AND THAT HAPPENS VERY OFTEN. BETWEEN PASSPORTS AND CAMERAS -- VISITING VICTIMS ARE OFTEN ARE ACTUALLY THE MAJORITY OF VICTIMS -- IN CAR BREAK INS ESPECIALLY IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND I GETTING THEM TO COME BACK WHEN THEY'VE LEFT OUR SUBPOENA POWER. BECOMES AN INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AND THE AS A RESULT WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED THROUGH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE INSTEAD OF DIRECT EVIDENCE AND IT'S A IT'S A IT'S THE DANCE THAT IS. VERY -- UNNECESSARY CONSIDERING HOW -- OBVIOUS IT IS THAT THE DOOR WAS THAT THE WINDOW WAS BROKEN IN ORDER TO GAIN ENTRY TO A LOCKED VEHICLE. SO -- SB TWENTY THREE CLOSES THIS LOGIC DEFYING LOOPHOLE AND WE HOPE THAT. YOU WILL OF THE WOODEN SUPPORTS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR OUR LAWS THAT REFLECT PROJECT. THANK YOU NEXT TO IT. HI AMBER NEWTON AT PRESIDENCY OF CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CAL TRAVEL HERE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER FOR YOUR HELP ON THIS BILL AND ALSO FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL. CAR BREAK INS ARE A REALLY TROUBLING SITUATION FOR OUR TOURISM INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY IN THE BAY AREA BUT REALLY ACROSS THE STATE. AND AS MENTIONED RENTAL CARS ARE OFTEN PARTICULAR TARGET THAT AFFECTS OUR TOURISM INDUSTRY NEGATIVELY -- COVERAGE THAT WE GET IN STATE LOCAL NATIONAL MEDIA AND ON PEOPLE SOCIAL MEDIA AMPLIFY THAT NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE AND THAT BREAKING CAUSES. IN THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL AND TOURISM INDUSTRY WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN CREATING WONDERFUL EXPERIENCES FOR VISITORS AND ALSO FOR OUR RESIDENTS. WE BRING IN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF DIRECT REVENUE EVERY YEAR AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN ONE MILLION JOBS AND ELEVEN BILLION. DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES SO IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY THAT THIS IS HURTING. WHEN SOMEONE HAS A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE LIKE A CAR BREAK IN? IT DOES ONLY RUIN THEIR TRIP BUT IT CREATES A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH THE CITY AND THE STATE OF THAT LINGERS. SO. RIGHT NOW CURRENT LAWS YOU HERDS -- STATES THAT PROSECUTORS HAVE TO PROVE A CAR DOOR WAS LOCKED AS PART OF A BREAK IN. BUT WHEN INTEREST HAS THEIR RENTAL CAR BROKEN THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO RETURN TO TESTIFY FOR THAT TRIAL SO IT'S A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT IS MISSING. SB TWENTY THREE WOULD HELP REMEDY THE SITUATION BY INCLUDING FORCED ENTRY IS AN ELEMENT OF THE VEHICLE BREAKING STATUTES. AND IN OUR EYES THAT'S REALLY A WIN WIN WIN IT'S A IT'S A WIN FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR RESIDENTS AND FOR VISITORS. YOU'LL HELP ME QUIT LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO COMBAT CAR BURGLARIES AND HELP ENSURE THAT. VISITORS AND RESIDENTS HAVE A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA. SO ONCE AGAIN WHEN I THINK THE SENATOR AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THE PARTNERSHIP AND WORK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK THANK YOU LET'S SEE IF THERE'S OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS HO SHALL MUCH CHILDREN WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. AND BRENDAN UP ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT SO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION COME TO THE TABLE AND I WANT IT JUST AS A REMINDER AND CENTER WIENER REFERENCES BUT THIS BILL. WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO US LAST YEAR WE AMENDED IT SIGNIFICANTLY AND SO THE BILL NOW IS EXACTLY AS WE PASSED IT LAST YEAR WHICH HAD THE AMENDMENTS THAT REMOVED -- ACLU'S OPPOSITION -- BUT WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR GO AHEAD. MY NAME IS LESLIE CALDWELL IN REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND MEMBERS LAWYERS PRIVATE AND PUBLIC -- AND INVESTIGATORS AROUND THE STATE -- I PERSONALLY RECENTLY RETIRED AS THE SOLANO COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR NINE YEARS AND BEFORE THAT. I PRACTICED ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS AN INDIGENT DEFENSE -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS UNNECESSARILY CREATE A NEW OFFENSE WE DO NOT BELIEVE. AS IS STATED IN THE NEED FOR THE BILL ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR AND ALL DUE RESPECT -- IT IS NOT A STRIKE -- IT IS NOT AN INHERENTLY DANGEROUS -- FELONY AND THE FELONY MURDER RULE HAS BEEN CHANGED CONSIDERABLY SO THOSE CONCERNS I DON'T BELIEVE ARE VALID CONCERNS -- THERE IS AN INDICATION THAT IT'S A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE -- FOR THE DEATH PENALTY. AND THE IN FACT IT IS BUT I'VE ONLY FUND ONE INSTANCE IN A LONG HISTORY OF IT BEING USED AS A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE -- I LOOKED INTO THE LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE OF ONE OF THE LOCKED VEHICLE REQUIREMENT. AND AT THAT TIME IT WAS PUT IN THERE TO MAKE THE TRIP CRIME MORE SERIOUS THAN SOMEBODY JUST SIMPLY OPENING A DOOR AND TAKING SOMETHING. SO SIMPLE PETTY OR GRAND THEFT. THAT'S WHY IT WAS PUT IN THERE -- YES THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH GETTING THE WITNESSES BACK WHEN THEY OUR TOURIST OR SOMEONE IN ANOTHER COUNTY -- AND PUTTING IN THIS. CHANGE DOESN'T ADDRESS. THE WHOLE PROBLEM BECAUSE IF YOU NEED A WITNESS TO COME IN AND SAY THE DOOR WAS LOCKED USE ALSO STILL NEED THE WITNESS EITHER AT A PRELIMINARY HEARING IN A FELONY OR THE TRIAL IN A MISDEMEANOR. TO SAY. THE THE CAR WAS ENTERED WITHOUT. THE DRIVER'S PERMISSION -- THE CASE LAW IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT MOST CASES SAY THAT A BROKEN WINDOW IS ACCEPTABLE AS A SIGN THAT THE DOORS WERE LOCKED -- SO THAT EVIDENCE IS ACCEPTED THE ONLY TIME IT'S A PROBLEM IS BECAUSE IT'S AN ELEMENT OF THE OFFENSE -- AND IT HAS TO BE PROVED AT TRIAL NOW THE PRELIMINARY HEARING YOU CAN JUST HAVE THE OFFICER TESTIFY SO THE ONLY TIME YOU NEED. A WITNESS IS AT TRIAL. WILL SAN FRANCISCO MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER NUMBERS BUT ONLY CRIMINAL DEFENSE UNIVERSE OR THE CRIMINAL CHARGE UNIVERSE. GO TO TRIAL SO THIS NEW CRIME. DOES NOT ADDRESS THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF NEEDING THE WITNESS -- SECONDLY THE ISSUE OF FORCIBLY HAS TO BE CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE LAW AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS. IN THE ROBBERY STATUTE THERE'S A TAKING BY FORCE OR FEAR OVER THE YEARS THE CASE LAW HAS HAS. PRETTY MUCH EVISCERATED THE MEANING OF FORCE SO IT HAS NO MEANING ANYMORE IN THE ROBBERY STATUTE. AND SO IT WON'T HAVE A MEANING. IN AN AUTO BURKE STATUTE AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AND ASK FOR NAY VOTE. ALRIGHT LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEEN NINE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE SENATOR MORLOCK THANK YOU MANAGER I'M JUST CURIOUS -- ABOUT THE TRIAL ASPECT IN BRINGING THE WITNESS BACK ITS ENTERTAINER. IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE STENCH HAS CASE. BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE SAYING THAT THE CAR WAS BROKEN INTO BECAUSE IT WAS LOCKED WOULD BE WHAT HER SAY IT'S HEARSAY. THAT'S WHY I CAN'T THAT'S WHY YOU FORCE INTEREST TO COME BACK TO TRIAL. THAT'S WHY THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW REQUIRES THAT THE TOURISTS COME BACK YES. AND THEN I'M JUST CURIOUS FROM A TOURISM. DEPARTMENT WHO WERE PUTTING MARKINGS ON RENTAL CARS IS A BIT MUST BE DECALS OR SOMETHING THAT. KIND OF INFORMS. PEOPLE THAT THAT THAT THERE COULD BE A SUITCASE IN THE TRUNK. IT I'M JUST TRY TO INFORM TAURUS TO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING IN THE CAR THAT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A YOU KNOW FULL OR A TOURIST CAR WE ALSO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECT. THE REALITY IS THAT -- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE AT PIER THIRTY NINE IN YOUR PARK THERE'S THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE YOUR CAR'S GONNA GET. BROKEN INTO AND IT'S NOT JUST SOURCES SORCERESS EDINSON ANYONE WHO HAS SOMETHING IN A CAR AND SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T. THANK YOU MANAGER. A CENTER BRADFORD ARE YA I AM I AM IN THINKS SIR WE ARE FOR THIS BILL BUT AS LARGE YEAR AYE I REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS BECAUSE AYE AYE SHE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE BEING ARRESTEDAND CONVICTED OF AUTO THEFT. ON A REGULAR OUR BREAK INS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND IF YOU. LIVE IN SACRAMENTO EVEN LOSE YOUR LIFE FOR IT SO -- I DON'T SEE A NEED TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS OR ADDITIONAL LAWS RELATED. TO AUTO THEFT I THINK THE LOCAL LAWS CLEAR AS IT STATES ARE READY AND I I I I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN INHERENT -- FACT ANA. BLACK BROWN COMMUNITIES SO THANK CAN'T SUPPORT -- IT'S NOT SEEING ANY OTHER -- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- CENTER WINNER WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I REGARDING I CENTER BRADFORD SOLICITING THE NICE -- AS THE CENTER KNOWS I'M -- OVERWHELMINGLY ALIGNED WITH HIM ON THESE ISSUES AFFECT MY NEXT BILL -- WILL BE -- TO ELIMINATE EVER COMMONSENSE SAYING ENHANCEMENT. THIS DOES NOT ENHANCE A AND THE SENTENCING OF THE BILL -- YOU KNOW FRANKLY CLARIFIES WHAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE ALWAYS ASSUMED. THAT IF YOU BASH SHELL SOMEONE'S WINDOW TO GET INTO THE CAR YOU'RE GUILTY OF BURGLARIZING THE CAR I THINK IT'S COMMONSENSE. FOR MOST PEOPLE ASSUME -- YES THERE ARE CASES THAT HAVE HELD THAT THAT IS ENOUGH BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER CASES THAT HAVE HELD BY BASHING OUT A WINDOW IS NOT ENOUGH YOU DON'T PROVE THAT IT'S LOCKED -- AND WE KNOW THE CASES THAT ARE PRETTY CLEAR IN TERMS OF WHAT A NORMAL. REGULAR PERSON WOULD THANK IN VIEWING THE FAX OR BEING LOST ON AS A AS A RESULT -- SO -- I RESPECT THE OPPOSITION BUT I DISAGREE -- AND I WOULD SAY THAT I AM CONFIDENT THAT HAD WE SIMPLY -- MODIFY THE EXISTING A CRIME RATHER THAN CREATING A NEW CRIME TO AVOID FELONY MURDER ARE PRETTY CONFIDENT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S WOULD STILL BE OPPOSING US I DON'T THINK THAT. DISTINCTION IS A VALID ARGUMENT BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL. WE LIVED IN A LONG TIME TO GLORIA OF COURSE THAT DID NOT EXPEDITED OR MORAL OR DID. I APPRECIATE THAT AND IT WAS MY THAT'S MY BAD -- YEAH I GUESS ROOM WAY COMMITTEE CAN UNDER THE BUS BUT LEAVE IT ALONE -- ALL RIGHT SO LET'S. THE MOTION IS -- PAST TWO PROBES. SKINNER. AYE SKINNER AYE MORE LACKEY. WELL LIKE I BRADFORD. JACKSON. JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MORALE. WELL I WIENER AYE WIENER AYE. WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN YOUR MIND AND THEN WE WILL GO TO YOUR NEXT BILL THANKS. IF YOU [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED [inaudible] OKAY. MILLS MOVE YOU ON THE SET ROLE REVERSAL. THIS CALL YOU VERY BRIEFLY I SP ONE THIRTY SIX R. REPEALS -- A VERY COMMON ONE YEAR -- SENSING AND HAS BEEN. FOR MORE THAN ONE FELONY CONVICTION EVEN IF THEY'RE NONVIOLENT NONVIOLENT -- THE SENSING ENHANCEMENTS DO NOT INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY BUT THEY DO COST US ENORMOUSLY -- AND THEY CONTRIBUTE TO MASS -- INCARCERATIONS WHAT EFFECT CENTER MITCHELL -- FOR CARRYING THIS IS THE LAST YEAR AND FOR CO AUTHORING AT THIS YEAR -- AND IT'S TIME TO ELIMINATE THIS ENHANCEMENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE -- AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY BRIEFLY -- ARE -- CHECKED OUT IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER AT THE ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IN A LECTURE AT UC BERKELEY. AND WHEN A RESEARCHER GRAD STUDENT AND DIRECTOR OF PROJECT REBOUND -- CSU SACRAMENTO. RICK PLEASE PROCEED AND WE DID -- SUPPORT THIS BILL LAST YEAR SO WE CAN BE EXPEDITIOUS I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU I DON'T THINK I NEED TO TELL -- THIS COMMITTEE THAT TELL THE SENSING LAWS IN CALIFORNIA ARE VERY COMPLEX AND MY COLLEAGUES AT BERKELEY LAW -- THE CONSENSUS IS THAT -- THE CALIFORNIA SENSING SCHEME IS THE MOST COMPLICATED AND LABYRINTHINE IN THE ENTIRE NATION. AND WE HAVE. APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT -- CONDUCT IN SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS AND THIS ONE THIS ONE YEAR ENHANCEMENT. FOR PRISON PRIORS IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON -- I CALLED YESTERDAY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND ACCORDING TO THEIR LATEST FIGURES THERE ARE FIFTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO INMATES WHO ARE CURRENTLY SERVING A SENTENCE. THAT INCLUDES AT LEAST. ONE OF THESE ENHANCEMENTS UNDER SIX SIX SEVEN POINT -- FIVE SO I CHECK LAST NIGHT IT'S WHO WE SPEND ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO INCARCERATED IN IN MADE FOR ONE YEAR. IN -- IN A PRISON SO THIS MEANS THAT THIS ENHANCEMENTS NOT CHEAP EITHER -- THAT WE ARE IF MY MATH IS RIGHT WE'RE CURRENTLY SPENDING ABOUT ONE POINT TWO THREE BILLION DOLLARS MAYBE MORE -- ON THIS ENHANCEMENT SO THE QUESTION IS IS IT COST EFFECTIVE. AND I FEAR THAT IT IS NOT -- EVERY DAY IS A PUBLIC DEFENDER I WATCHED PEOPLE GO TO PRISON. AND THEY TYPICALLY FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES -- THE VAST MAJORITY ARE PEOPLE WHO BACK INTO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. BECAUSE OF MENTAL ILLNESS DRUG ADDICTION OR POVERTY -- BUT THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHOSEN CRIME IS THEIR PROFESSION. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A SMART COST EFFECTIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. STRIVES TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IN THE FIRST CATEGORY OUT OF PRISON. AND THE PEOPLE IN THE SECOND CATEGORY IN -- THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ONE YEAR PRISON PRIOR ENHANCEMENT DOESN'T REALLY DO THAT IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY IT CAST THE NET TOO WIDE AND SCOOPS UP TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THAT FIRST CATEGORY. BECAUSE IT APPLIES TO ANY FELONY CONVICTION AT ALL -- IN AT THE SAME TIME I THINK IT IS ANOTHER STEP. IN TOWARD UNTANGLING THIS LABYRINTHINE -- CRIMINALS -- SENTENCING SCHEME THAT WE HAVE -- THIS THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO SWING THE PRISON DOORS WIDE OPEN. IT IS NOT GONNA SEND RECIDIVISM RATES SOARING AND IT'S NOT GOING TO PREVENT JUDGES FROM STRICTLY PUNISHING SERIOUS OFFENDERS WHO COMMIT CRIMES OF VIOLENCE OR SEX. THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER ENHANCEMENTS TO DO THAT -- WHAT IT WILL DO IS TAKE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND THAT'S WHY SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. A GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY -- I'M IN FULL SUPPORT IT SB ONE THIRTY SIX AS SOMEONE WHO HAS PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED -- FIRSTHAND THE COMPOUNDING DAMAGES AND COMPLICATIONS THAT THE WANT THE CURRENT WHEN YOUR ENHANCEMENT FOR EACH PRISON PRIOR. CREATES FOR THOSE LIKE MYSELF. IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I WAS IN THIS FIGHT WHERE I THREW ONE PUNCH SUBSEQUENTLY MY FRIEND DIED AS A RESULT OF THAT PUNCH. THERE WAS THERE WAS NO MALICIOUS FOUR DOT COM. IT WAS A DISAGREEMENT AND I DON'T AND I DON'T HAVE THE SKILL THAT THE TIME TO DEAL WITH THE ADVERSITY ITS SITUATION. I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT I'VE DONE. REMORSEFUL OF THE PAIN IN DAMAGES THAT COST. WHILE IN JAIL THE CASE PENDING THERE WERE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN MY PUBLIC DEFENDER AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND THIS WAY I WAS THREATENED WITH SECOND DEGREE MURDER. HEY WE DECIDED TO GO TO TRIAL SCARED FOR MY LIFE I BEGAN TO BE OPEN TO THE IDEA OF A PLEA AGREEMENT. THE FIRST OFFER WORDS OF THE PLAY TO VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. I AT SEVEN YEARS WITH THE STRIKE HOWEVER I WAS NOT GUILTY OF VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AS THERE WAS NO FELONIOUS ACT THAT TRANSPIRED DURING THE INCIDENT. I DEPLETED MEANT I THAT I DID ACCEPT WAS THREE YEARS IN WHICH I PLAYED TO THE MID TERM OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AN ADDITIONAL ONE YEAR ONE THIRD ORIGINAL SINCE WAS ORDERED TO BE RANKING SECONDLY. BECAUSE IT THE ENHANCEMENT FOR PRESS EMPIRE BRINGING SINCE TO FOUR YEARS TOTAL. I WON THE POINTS THAT WE WERE CONTESTING ON DURING NEGOTIATIONS WAS RECOGNIZING THAT I HAD ONLY GONE TO PRISON ONCE. ALTHOUGH IN THE EYES OF THE LAW WIN MY PROBATION REVOKED IN ANOTHER COUNTY BECAUSE THEY HAD GONE TO PRISON THE FIRST TIME IT APPEARED THAT BEEN TO PRISON TWICE. I NEARLY DODGE ONE PRISON PRIOR ENHANCEMENT BUT CANNOT ESCAPE THE CLUTCHES THE OTHER AS I DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO MANY RESOURCES DON'T DO TO MY LOW SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS. ARE WHILE SERVING THE ENHANCEMENT PORTION MY PRISON TIME I MISSED OUT ON MANY HOLIDAYS BIRTHDAYS THE DEATH OF A FRIEND MY FATHER BEING HOSPITALIZED FOR HEART COMPLICATIONS MY BROTHER. HAVING A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE DOOMED TO NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND TO CONTINUE POSTPONEMENT OF ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR MYSELF. I DO NOT WISH TO TYPE OF PRISON EXPERIENCE THAT ENTERED UPON ANYONE. LET ALONE EXTENDING PRISON SENTENCES BECAUSE ENHANCEMENT HAS BEEN EMPIRICALLY PROVEN TO NOT IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY NOR DOES IT DETER CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. I BELIEVE IT TO CONFUSION DAY THAT SB ONE THIRTY SIX PASSES SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE AWAY FROM PUNITIVE PRACTICES THAT. A MOVEMENT MORE TOWARDS RESTORE METHODOLOGY [inaudible] THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHOP BY CHARLIE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION INTEREST OF TIME -- JUST STOP BASED ON PAST THE YEARS WEEK CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS POLICY THANK YOU THE BILL [inaudible] RIGHT TIME. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY. OR COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- YEAH JUST LIKE THAT I DON'T THINK -- THE SENATE IN HAND THE OF THE JUDICIAL ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM CRIMINAL JUSTICE FOR WHICH IS RIDICULOUS. I KNOW MANY JUDGES AND NOT ONE OF THEM [inaudible] A WILL. ADMIT OR OR THEY ALL ADMIT THAT THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT. HOW TO DO THE SENTENCING THERE ARE NUMEROUS COURSES THEY TRY TO GIVE? OUR TWO JUDGES SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE ASKED TO TWO SENTENCE PEOPLE -- AND FOR EACH TWO JUDGES THEY'RE SERVING THIS EXPERT YOU GET THREE OPINIONS SO I THANK YOU -- FOR A DRESSING THIS PROBLEM. THE HOPE WAS THE MORE WE PUNISH PEOPLE THE MORE THEY'LL CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR WE KNOW THAT HASN'T WORKED AND THIS WHOLE SYSTEM. HAS BEEN ALMOST AN EMBARRASSMENT I THINK TO THE COURTS AND TO OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I HAVE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH JUDGES WHO ARE -- TRULY VERY FRUSTRATED BY ALL THE ENHANCEMENTS AND THEN YOU DEDUCT FOR THIS AND YOUR SENTENCE WAS IN A AN EXAMPLE. OF OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT A SYSTEM THAT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND I BET THAT THIS WILL ALSO IF WE START CLERK CLEARING UP THIS PROCESS. IT WILL SAVE THE STATE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE I KNOW THERE INSTANCES WHERE PUBLIC DEFENDERS COME IN AND THEY CHALLENGES SENTENCING. DECISION SO WE CAN HELP. ONE THE CORDS -- TRY TO FIND BETTER WAYS TO ASSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO COMMIT OFFENSES DO NOT RECIDIVISTS -- AND THE CHANGING THIS IS JUST A SMALL BUT I THINK A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD SO WITH THAT I ALSO SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY VOTE ON THANK YOU SENATOR -- HI. I THINK THAT THIS MAY BE A SUBJECT MATTER THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. WHETHER WE CONVENE A SIMILAR -- GROUPING AS WAS SUGGESTED BY -- SENATOR MITCHELL AROUND FEDERAL ISSUE OR WHETHER THERE IS AN ENTITY THAT WE COULD -- YOU KNOW I DON THINK IN I DON'T THINK THE STATE AUDITOR QUITE WORKS BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE BROUGHT THE BILL BACK I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT -- SENATOR MITCHELL'S BILL OF DID NOT SUCCEED LAST YEAR BUT WHAT IS VERY FRUSTRATING IS THAT WE'RE HAVING TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE RE HAVING TO DO INDIVIDUAL BILLS. ON THESE FOR SOME FOUR HUNDRED NINE I MEAN LOOK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF THOSE OR MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN A COUPLE OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED OR SO -- SENSE ENHANCEMENT STATUTES THAT WE HAVE THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME JUSTIFICATION BUT IF WE IMAGINE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO CARRY AN INDIVIDUAL BILL FOR THE ELIMINATION OF WHATEVER SET OF LET'S CALL LEAST A MINIMUM OF A HUNDRED OR BAD. OR NOT USED OR NOT SERVING THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN INTENDED IT COULD TAKE US FOR EVER SO YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN APPROACH THIS IN MORE COMPREHENSIVELY BUT FOR NOW I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THIS AND I WILL.
