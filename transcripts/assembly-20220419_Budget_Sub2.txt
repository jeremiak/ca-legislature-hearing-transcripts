I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY ONE WHICH ESTABLISHES A SET OF MINIMUM CROWD SAFETY STANDARDS USING CROWDS SCIENCE AND OTHER BEST PRACTICES TO GUIDE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHEN PERMITTING LARGE OUTDOOR EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE SAFEST EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE ATTENDING. OUTDOOR CONCERTS AND FESTIVALS ARE WONDERFUL WAY FOR FANS LIKE MYSELF TO ENJOY LIVE MUSIC IN A FUN INTERACTIVE AND ACCEPTING ATMOSPHERE THERE ARE NUMEROUS CONCERTS AND FESTIVALS HELD EVERY YEAR OF COURSE AROUND THE WORLD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND HUNDREDS THAT TAKE PLACE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MOST OF THESE EVENTS- THANKFULLY TRANSPIRED WITHOUT INCIDENT HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CONCERTS AND FESTIVALS WHERE DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE RESULTED IN SERIOUS INJURY AND LOSS EVEN LOSS OF LIFE FOR CONCERT AND FESTIVAL GOERS TRANSFORMING WHAT SHOULD BE A JOYOUS AND MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE INTO TRAGEDY. MOST CONCERTS AND FESTIVALS ARE VERY WELL PLANNED AND EXECUTED AND MOST CONCERT AND FESTIVAL PROMOTERS AND OPERATORS WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH COUNTY AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. HOWEVER THE STATE AT PRESENT DOES NOT HAVE A SET OF MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARDS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CONCERT THAT IS HELD THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE. THE DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT UNFOLD DURING THESE EVENTS ARE OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE AND NOT ALL OF THEM CAN BE PREVENTED BUT THEY CAN'T BE PLANNED FOR. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES CROWD SCIENCE AND OTHER BEST PRACTICES HAVE BEEN UTILIZED BY PROMOTERS OR PICTURES AND SECURITY EXPERTS TO HELP THEM FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIOS. THE APPLICATION OF CROPSCIENCE AND OTHER BEST PRACTICES HELP PROMOTERS ORGANIZED AND PRETTY EXPERTS BETTER UNDERSTAND AND PLAN FOR CHANGES IN CROWD BEHAVIOR AND MOOD THROUGH CROWD MODELING AND OTHER METHODS WHICH CAN THEN BE APPLIED DURING A LIVE EVENT. BY PUTTING THESE MEASURES IN PLACE PROMOTERS ORGANIZERS AND SECURITY EXPERTS CAN ADDRESS THESE DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES SAFELY AS THEY DEVELOP AND PUT IN PLACE PROTOCOLS TO STOP A CONCERT OR FESTIVAL OF THE INCIDENT. IS DETERMINED TO POSE AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO LIFE OR HEALTH AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY ONE IS A SENSIBLE MEASURE THAT HELPS GUARANTEE THE SAFEST EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE THAT IS IN ATTENDANCE AT AN ALCOVE OUTDOOR. CONCERT OR FESTIVAL HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY MARKET PRATT WHO IS HERE ON BEHALF OF AG AND ZACH ALPERN THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR INSOMNIAC. A UNIT OF LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT THAT PROMOTES ELECTRONIC MUSIC EVENTS. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- HAS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO GET MY NAME IS MARK A PRAM WITH THE FIRM OF THE PREY AND KAYLEE. AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF A E. G. AND H. G. PRESENTS THE LIFE IN OUR- DIVISION OF AG AND WE'RE PROUD TO BE IN SUPPORT OF. AB TWO SIX. EIGHT ONE HEADQUARTERED IN LOS ANGELES AG IS THE WORLD'S LEADING SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY. AND HAS DEVELOPED WORLD CLASS VENUES AS WELL AS MAJOR SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICTS LIKE CRYPTO DOT COM ARENA FORMALLY KNOWN AS STAPLES CENTER. AND LA LIVE MERCEDES BENZ AT MERCEDES PLOTS IN BERLIN AND- THE O. TWO IN LONDON. EIJI IS ALSO THE WORLD'S LARGEST OPERATOR HIGH PROFILE SPORTING EVENTS AND SPORTS FRANCHISES INCLUDING THE LOS ANGELES KINGS LOS ANGELES GALAXY AND ICE BEAR IN BERLIN. FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGIUS PLACE WHEN DR NEW STUDENTS HOWEVER I ASK THAT WE ALSO CONSIDER WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A STUDENT ON THE GROUND WITH DETERIORATING QUALITY OF EDUCATION. A STUDENT SATISFACTION LEVEL WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO DECREASE IT IS. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT SAY ABOUT THE COULD NOT ASK FOR A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WE CANNOT HAVE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH PROFESSORS. AND THEY CAN ALSO NOT MAINTAIN THEIR EDUCATION AND THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE CLIENT HOUSING IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF BASS BUT ALSO THE WAY IN WHICH WE CHOOSE TO OPERATE THE INSTITUTION AND EXPAND ITS OVERALL CAPACITY. IS ALSO A MAJOR PART OF BASS. BUT IF WE WANT TO CHOOSE TO DO THIS I ASK BUT WE ALSO CONSIDER WHAT WE CAN DO TO BE PROACTIVE RATHER THAN REACTIVE. MANY OF THE RESOURCES BY OUR CAMPUSES WORK TO OFFER SUCH AS THESE HOUSING VOUCHERS AND GRANTS ARE MEANT TO SUPPLEMENT A STUDENTS INCOME OR LACK OF INCOME TO AFFORD RENTS. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT ENOUGH IF WE SIMPLY CHOOSE TO BE REACTIVE WE WILL NEVER GET TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE. THE HEART OF THE ISSUE IS LACK OF HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY THE HEART. IS THE HEART OF THE ISSUE IS THE LACK OF THE FORTY. EVEN WHEN WE HAVE. I ALSO THOUGHT WE IT WASTE MAKE OUR MORE EXCESSIVE BY INCH THAT THE BAD STUFF OUR AVAIL IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE MORE AFFORDABLE I ASKED BUT WE TRY TO MAKE THIS MORE ACCESSIBLE BY ENSURING THAT THE CONDITIONS BUT WE ASK STUDENTS TO LIVE AND- ARE NOT. INFERIOR TO THE WAY THAT WE WOULD ASK OUR REGULAR CITIZENS TO INTERACT WITH THEIR LIVING CONDITIONS. AND LASTLY I ASKED BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER HOUSING. FOR STUDENTS I ASKED BUT WE PRESSURE THE UC TO NOT ONLY MAKE HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE BUT ALSO THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH A DORM PROJECTS SUCH AS THE MUNGER DORMAN MY- CAMPUS. WE NEED HOUSING BUT I'M ASKING BUT WE HOUSE STUDENTS IN HUMANE CONDITIONS AND A HAMSTER BOX WHERE WE CAN JUST TRYING SHOT FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS FOR THE SAKE OF IT. WITH FOUGHT BACK INCLUDES MY REMARKS BINGO. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FIRST THOSE REALLY HELPFUL AND- NEXT WE HAVE OUR REPRESENT THEM FROM THAT CAL STATE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION FABULA MARINO READ LESS I THINK WE HAVE FAVIOLA ON THE- WEBEX. RETAILERS ARE AFRAID EVERYONE HEAR ME YEAH HE JUST START TALKING REGARDING THANK YOU OKAY OUR SON HELLO GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS FAR ALONG WITH A NINE NINE HERE REPRESENTING THE CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION ALSO A FOURTH YEAR STUDENT AT AT SAN DIEGO STATE GRADUATING THIS MAY I CALIFORNIANS ARE NO STRANGERS TO THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT THE CRISIS AFFECTS STUDENTS IN WAYS THAT CREATE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS IN THEIR PURSUIT OF A DEGREE. THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HOUSING INFLATES THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE FOR OUR STUDENTS SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS FACE IN TRYING TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS SEARCHING FOR A PLACE TO LIVE BECAUSE MANY STUDENTS SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS EACH CAMPUS COMMUNITY AND THE CSU HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES BASED ON THE VARIETY AND SKATES AND THE COST OF LIVING ACROSS OUR STATE. OUR CSU CAMPUSES IN SAN FRANCISCO HUMBLED AT BAKERSFIELD ARE EACH GOING TO HAVE DISTINCT NEEDS FOR STUDENTS MANY STUDENTS ARE ALSO ON THEIR OWN IN THEIR VERY FIRST ATTEMPTS TO FIND SOMEWHERE TO LIVE ON OR OFF CAMPUS STUDENTS OFTENTIMES RUN INTO PROBLEMS OF LANDLORDS HAVING QUICK TURNAROUND TIMES FOR SIGNING THE LEASE COMPLICATING THE HOUSING SEARCH FOR STUDENTS TRYING TO PLAN AHEAD. CEMEX IS. ARE THERE MORE AFFORDABLE. AS FAR TO LOOSEN FOR MANY STUDENTS AND HOURS. WE CRIME SUCH AS A DEPOSIT COAST. AND INCOME ARE DIFFICULT TO ME RIGHT AWAY LOW INCOME PARKS YOUTH. STUDENTS BASED ECONOMY ARE AND ARE. WHAT EXAMPLE A ROOM THAT INCLUDES A MEAL PLAN AT S. COST SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SINGLE SPACE ALL CAMPUS NEAR THIS YEAR CAN CATCH CAN COST UP ABOUT DOLLARS. LET ANALYSIS OFFICE AS THE A SIX THOUSAND ELEVEN DOLLAR RANGE I'M HOW. ARE ACTIVE THE YEAR STUDENTS. I WOULD ALSO TO ADD THAT A PRODUCT. 11% OF CSEC ARE YOU TO HAVE AS HOME OR HOUSING. THE ONSET OF THE COVENANTING PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED EVEN GREATER CHALLENGES FOR STUDENTS. CHANGES WERE MOST PRONOUNCED AMONG THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS 65% OF ITS WITH ZERO EFC REPORTED A CHANGE AND THEIR LIVING SITUATION COMPARED TO ONLY 57% OF RESPONDENTS WITH GREATER THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS YES THE- BY LOWERING THE- OF A- WITH PROPER. AID WE LESSEN THE BURDEN BACK HOUSING HAS ON STUDENTS THAT IS WHY WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE LEGISLATORS PASS SUPPORT OF THE CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAME. THIS YEAR WE ARE ONCE AGAIN ASKING FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATORS AND THE GOVERNOR TO SUPPORT PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE FINANCIAL AID THAT ACTUALLY COVERS THE FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE. HOUSING IS THE GREATEST COSTS FOR STUDENTS IT CAN BE DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE COST OF TUITION. YES ALSO THAT LEGISLATORS REALLY TAKE THE TIME TO KNOW THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND OUR DISTRICT. AND TO ASK QUESTIONS TO UNDERSTAND THE UNIQUE HOUSING CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS BATES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY WITH A SECURE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT. HOUSING TO LIVE STUDENTS CAN GRADUATE DEBT FREE AND ON TIME. FOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE- NEXT WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM PERSPECTIVE FROM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT. YEAH HI MY NAME IS JOHNSON PRASAD AND I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE STUDENT SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES REPRESENTING OVER ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS NEARLY 60% OF OUR STUDENTS REPORTER- THE FACING AT LEAST ONE BASIC NEEDS INSECURITY WITH THE RATES HIGHEST FOR MINORITY STUDENT POPULATIONS DURING THE BEGINNING STAGES OF THE PANDEMIC STUDENTS 57% REPORTED A- AT LEAST ONE BASIC NEEDS INSECURITY INCLUDING 40% REPORTING FOOD INSECURITY. 37% REPORTING HOUSING AND SECURITY AN 18% REPORTING HOMELESSNESS. STUDENTS WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO INDICATE HOUSING IN SECURITIES WERE NOT CONSIDERING RE ENROLLMENT. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM HAS ALREADY FACE A DECREASE OF ENROLLMENT DURING THE PANDEMIC AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE STUDENTS DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP ON SCHOOL BUT IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. THE SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE OUR STUDENTS WHAT IS THE THING YOU PERSONALLY NEED RIGHT NOW. THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED ANSWER WAS FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THE SURVEY FOUND THAT 26% OF STUDENTS ANSWERED WITH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THERE IS A QUOTE FROM A STUDENT THAT STATES. WITHOUT FINANCIAL AID THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND SCHOOL DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE OUR ENTIRE FAMILY LOST THEIR JOBS AND IT WAS HARD TO AFFORD COLLEGE. ON TOP OF PAYING THEIR BILLS. AS A STUDENT WHO QUALIFY FOR PELL GRANT UNFORTUNATELY QUALIFIES FOR CAL GRANT BUT DOES NOT RECEIVE IT HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE TO CONTINUE MY EDUCATION AND ENSURING THAT I CAN SEE ON THE PATHWAY THAT I WANT AND GRADUATE WITH A DEGREE THAT I DESIRE. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE LEGISLATURE REALIZED THAT STUDENTS HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR FINANCIAL AID FOR FIVE PLUS MORE YEARS AND THAT IT'S BEEN STRONGER MORE THAN EVER. AS THE THREE OF US SIT HERE TODAY FABULOUS AS MAN NINE. THREE WOMAN EMPOWER REPRESENTING UNDER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS STEEP. ALL FISH HOUSING IN SECURITIES IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT MANY STUDENTS ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME STRUGGLE. WE ARE REPRESENTING OUR STUDENTS ON EVERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUS UC OR CSU TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE NEED THESE RESOURCES SO WE CAN CONTINUE OUR EDUCATIONAL POP WAY ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC. I SOMEONE WHO USED HOW GRANT TO COVER MOST OF THEIR TUITION IT DOESN'T COVER THE FULL COST SUCH AS TEXTBOOKS WHICH WE ALL KNOW COST UP TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND UNFORTUNATELY MY CASE SOMETIMES TO SELL MYSELF BECAUSE WE HAVE THE COURSE ONLINE ACCESS CODE THAT WE ALSO PAY FOR. AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT WE EE OUR STUDENTS INCREASING IN A MOMENT JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE COST OF COLLEGE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT SOME FOR AFFORDABLE FOR STUDENTS SO THEY CAN CONTINUE IN PROVIDE BACKED HER WORKFORCE. SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE PASSIONATE AND ARE EAGER TO LEARN AND PURSUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL DEGREE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE BEING STOPPED BY THESE SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS THAT ARE PREVENTING THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. AND I THOUGHT I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU GUYS TO LISTEN TO STUDENTS AND ESPECIALLY THE FIX FINANCIAL AID COALITION WHICH WE ALL REPRESENT. TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED THIS YEAR AND THAT THE FULL FRAMEWORK IS MATT FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS TO PER THROUGH THEIR HIGHER. EDUCATION CAREER THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND IT WAS HELPFUL TO HEAR FROM OUR STUDENTS- AND THEN WE'LL GET TO THE- THE ACTUAL PROPOSALS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WERE INCLUDING IN IN THE NEXT YEAR A BUDGET WE HAD A MAJOR HEARING ON THIS AS WE KNOW THIS FALL. WE TALKED ABOUT THE INTERIM- APPLICATIONS COMING IN FROM LAST YEAR'S ALLOCATION SO NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALEJO IN THE SEGMENTS ABOUT THAT AND POTENTIAL ACTION FOR- FOR GOING FOR IT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU YEAH. SEVEN YOU BRING UP DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE L. A. O. AND- WELL FED UP THERE YEAH AND THE THREE SEGMENTS. HELLO. NOT GOOD OKAY WE'RE GONNA START WITH JENNIFER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS JENNIFER COFFEE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS PART OF MY REMARKS I WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR. FINANCES RECOMMENDATION FOR THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT WERE DUE ON MARCH FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN THE PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INVESTMENT. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT ESTABLISHED THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM WHICH SET ASIDE TWO BILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. TO ESTABLISH A LOW COST STUDENT HOUSING GANT PROGRAM FOR THE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS. FOCUSED ON EXPANDING THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING. A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROGRAMSB ONE SIXTY NINE APPROPRIATED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FOR THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF FUNDING. OF THE APPROPRIATED FUNDING UP TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO SUPPORT PLANNING GRANTS TO DETERMINE IF IT IS FEASIBLE FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO CONSTRUCT. AN OFFER AFFORDABLE STUDENT RENTAL HOUSING. ON MARCH FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SUBMITTED A LETTER TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WITH A LIST OF RECOMMENDED CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED IN THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING. A LIST OF ELIGIBLE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS OF THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT RECOMMENDING BE FUND FUNDED OUT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION APPROPRIATED FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT FINANCING TERM TO BE AN ELIGIBLE GRANT FUNDING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PRIORITIZE SUPPORT FOR PROPOSED PROJECTS. THAT ROUGHLY RIVER THAT REFLECTED IT INTER SEGMENTAL HOUSING ARRANGEMENT. AND THEN PRIORITIZED FURTHER APPLICATIONS BASED UPON A WEIGHTED RANKING THAT COMPLIANT THAT COMBINED AN APPLICANT STATE SUPPORTED PER BED. CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND AN APPLICANT'S PROPOSED OVER STUDENT RENTAL RATES. IN THAT LETTER TO THE JAIL BC FINANCE ALSO SUBMITTED A LIST OF PLANNING GRANTS TO BE AWARDED TO COLLEGES REQUESTING PLANNING GRANTS AND PLANNING GRANT FUNDING WAS PRIORITIZE. TO SUPPORT EARLY STAGE PLANNING ACTIVITY ACTIVITIES FOR ALL COLLEGES REQUESTING PLANNING GRANTS. FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE SECOND INSTALLMENT OF THE PLAN TWO BILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. DO CONCENTRA SOLELY- BEFORE I DELVE INTO OUR COMMENTS- JUST FUTURE FOLLOWING ALONG IN THE AGENDA. OF PAGE FOR- SUMMARIZES THE PROJECTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS RECOMMENDING TO SELECT FOR ROUND ONE GRANTS. H. FIVE DISPLAYS ALL OF THE PROPOSED PLANNING GRANTS THAT THEIR- ADMINSTRATION'S PROPOSING. AND THEN ON PAGE SIX THAT FIRST TABLE ARE THE PROJECTS THAT WERE ALSO DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS BUT- AREN'T RANKED LOWER AND THUS ARE NOT BEING PROPOSED FOR ROUND ONE GRANTS. AND THEN I FINAL TABLE ON PAGE SIX ARE OF THE PROJECTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION- DETERMINED TO BE INELIGIBLE FOR ROUND ONE GRANTS. AND THEN JUST TO CLARIFY THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN THIS PROGRAM- UNDER THE PROGRAM THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE OR ALTERNATELY TASKED WITH REVIEWING APPLICATIONS AND SELECTING- PROJECTS FOR ROUND ONE GRANTS. THEIR ADMINISTRATION HAS SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL- BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR THAT MUST DECIDE ON THE- FINAL OUT. PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED THROUGH ON ONE GRANTS. SO THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE BEFORE THIS- COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW. WE OFFER THREE. SETS OF. COMMENTS THAT I WILL QUICKLY GO THROUGH A HIGH LEVEL AND THEN WE CAN ELABORATE MORE DURING THE Q. AND A- OUR FIRST SET OF COMMENTS ARE- AROUND THE MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE TO. ON SITE PROJECTS. NOW WHEN WE REVIEWED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WE THOUGHT IT TO BE REASONABLE AT GENERALLY ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES SET FORTH IN STATUTE. BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER APPROACHES THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE- AND NOT KEEPING THAT IN MIND RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE START WEIGHING THESE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AN ATTORNEY WHICH ONE OF WHICH OPTIONAL LINES WITH ITS OBJECTIVES FOR THE A PROGRAM. NOW NOTE THAT YOU'LL VERY LIKELY HEAR A LOT OF IDEAS IN TERMS OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES THAT YOU COULD TAKE. WE OFFER SOME ALTERNATIVE IDEAS ON PAGES SEVEN AND EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA. AND THEN STAFF OFFER SOME ADDITIONAL IDEAS ON PAGE TEN. AND I SUSPECT YOU'LL HEAR EVEN A SOME ADDITIONAL- IDEAS FROM THE SEGMENTS. AS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS- YOU KNOW FUNDAMENTALLY IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO START WITH WHAT ARE THE GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM. IF THE GOALS ARE SOLELY ABOUT IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. IS A STARTING POINT TO GET THEIR- IF YOU HAVE MANY OTHER OBJECTIVES FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO FOCUS IN AREAS THAT HAVE HIGH HOUSING SHORTAGES IN HIGH DEMAND. OR IF YOUR FOCUS IS ON ENROLLMENT CAPACITY. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS YOU COULD MODIFY THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO MORE EXPLICITLY CONSIDER THOSE FACTORS. SO AGAIN IT'S REALLY GOING TO. FALL ON WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE FOR- FOR THIS PROGRAM. HEY CAN HAPPY DURING THE CUNY TO ELABORATE MORE ON ANY IDEAS THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. OUR SECOND SET OF COMMENTS ARE AROUND THE VARIOUS PROGRAM RISKS THAT- WE THINK ARE PRESENT IN THIS PROGRAM. NOW ALL CAPITAL OUTLAY- PROJECTS COME WITH SOME RISKS YOU KNOW THEY COME WITH THE RISK OF HAVING COST OVERRUNS COMING IN AT A DIFFERENT SCOPE OR HAD FACING IMPLEMENTATION DELAYS. WE THINK THESE RISKS ARE PARTICULARLY SALIENT IN THIS PROGRAM FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS THAT CAMPUSES GENERALLY HAVE LESS EXPERIENCE- CONSTRUCTING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE THE COLLEGES THAT HAVE. LITTLE EXPERIENCE- ONE THING HOUSING PROGRAMS GENERALLY. AND THEN SUDDENLY- CUT COST OVERRUNS SCOPE CHANGES COULD PUT THE STATE LEGISLATURE DIFFICULT POSITION. ON MAY COULD PUT PRESSURE ON THE CAMPUSES TO ALTER THEIR SCOPES R OR INCREASE THE PROPOSED RENTS THEREBY UNDERMINING THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM OR COULD PUT PRESSURE ON THE STATE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING- TO HELP COVER THESE COST OVERRUNS. KEEPING THIS IN MIND WE RECOMMEND A THREE STATUTORY CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM THAT WE THINK WILL HELP MITIGATE SOME OF THESE RISKS. AGAIN FOR THE SAKE OF TIME I WON'T GO THROUGH THEM AND BIG DETAIL DURING MY TESTIMONY BUT HAPPY TO ELABORATE MORE ON THE Q. AND A- BUT THE FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT THERE'S FUNDING FOR CONTINGENCY. ESTABLISHING A NOTIFICATION PROCESS FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THERE ARE NOTABLE SCOPE CHANGES. AND ALSO ENHANCING SOME OF THE PROGRAMS EXISTING REPORTING REQUIREMETS. FOR OUR FINAL SET OF COMMENTS OR AROUND THE VARIOUS PRIVATE HIGHER EDUCATION PRIORITIES LEGISLATORS FACING THIS YEAR- AS YOU AS THIS COMMITTEE IS DISCUSSED MANY TIMES THEY'RE STILL SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF UNMET FINANCIAL NEED AT THE SEGMENTS PARTICULARLY AT THE CAL STATE IN THE COMMUTER COLLEGE SYSTEMS. AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE OF THE GAP BETWEEN EXISTING FINANCIAL AID SPENDING AND THE LEVEL OF FINANCIALLY THAT EXISTS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. EVEN ONCE ALL THESE GRANTS ARE ALLOCATED THAT AFFORDABILITY GAP WILL STILL REMAIN. ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO FACING MANY ISSUES WITH ACADEMIC FACILITIES AT THE SEGMENTS RELATED TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SEISMIC SAFETY ISSUES THIS COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE MANY TIMES. AND THIS ISSUE WILL REMAIN EVEN AFTER THE GRANTS ARE FULLY ALLOCATED. GIVEN ALL THESE COMPETING ISSUES WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE START THINKING ABOUT WHICH OF THESE AREAS ARE AMONG THE TIRES PRIORITIES. AND REALLY FOCUS ITS RESOURCES ON ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. THANK YOU THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS HAPPY TO ELABORATE MORE IN Q. NAY. OKAY THANK YOU NOW LET'S HEAR FROM OUR- THREE SEGMENTS WHAT WE'LL START WITH OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE WAS EVER AT- EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND SUCCESS OF THE CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGES OVER THE PAST DECADE HOMELESSNESS HAS BEEN ON THE RISE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA MEAN COLLEGES STUDENTS ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN THE HOUSING CRISIS AS OUR STUDENT LEADER SHARED THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE A STATE BUDGET PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS- THE HOUSING CRISIS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING AFFORDABILITY HOUSING WITH DIGNITY AND A COMMITMENT TO EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS. FURTHER YET IT'S ANOTHER STRATEGY TOWARD STUDENT SUCCESS ON AVERAGE OUR STUDENTS SPEND FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO DOLLARS PER YEAR ON HOUSING THAT'S TEN TIMES MORE THAN THEY SPEND ON TUITION AND FEES. CURRENTLY TWELVE ME COLLEGES ACROSS THE SYSTEM HAVE STUDENT HOUSING AND WE HAVE CAPACITY FOR TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BEDS THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. THE PROPOSED- AND ELIGIBLE HOUSING- PROGRAMS ARE PROJECTS THAT WERE SUBMITTED TO YOU BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD MORE THAN DOUBLE THE STUDENT HOUSING THAT WE HAVE ACROSS OUR SYSTEM SO WE THINK. IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER INVESTMENTS THIS YEAR. EFFORTS TO BUILD A HOLISTIC STUDENT HOUSING NEEDS FRAMEWORK MUST INCLUDE A ROBUST FOCUS ON HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND THAT IS A KEY DISTINCTION WITHIN THE PROJECT THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU FORM FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO WE SUGGEST THE BUILDING ON THE ONE- BILLION COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES- THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. OF AWARDING THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO YOU I'M BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT ALSO- AND THOSE INCLUDE- FIVE PROJECTS ASSIST USE FRESNO IMPERIAL SIERRA AND VENTURA. BUT WE ALSO ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE ELIGIBLE PROJECTS THAT THOSE CAN MOVE FORWARD NOW- SO THAT YOU CAN PREVENT COST ESCALATION AND HELP US REACH THAT GOAL OF MORE THAN DOUBLING THE STUDENT HOUSING AVAILABLE ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. THAT WOULD MEAN FUNDING FOR A AND BAKERSFIELD COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS COMPTON BECAUSE SOME THIS RIVER LAKE TAHOE NAPA AND SANTA ROSA- SEVERAL OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN FIRE AFFECTED AREAS ACROSS OUR STATE STRUGGLING WITH HOUSING GENERALLY. THE PROPOSED AN ELIGIBLE COULD ENSURE THAT WE ARE MOVING FASTER AND- MORE EFFICIENTLY TOWARDS BUILDING- HOUSING ACROSS OUR SYSTEM IN BUILDING THAT CAPACITY TO ADDRESS BASIC NEEDS AND AFFORDABILITY. WE ALSO- ART COMMAND TODAY PROPOSED. ELIGIBLE PRODUCTS- AND PLANNING GRANTS OF THE APPROACH THAT WAS TAKEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHICH ENSURES THAT ALL SEVENTY FIVE APPLICANTS CAN RECEIVE SOME RESOURCES TO BEGIN ANALYZING THE FEASIBILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND BRING BEGIN THE IMPORTANT STEPS- OF ENSURING THOSE PROJECTS. LASTLY THE CALIFORNIA MYCOLOGISTS CANCERS OFFICE IS COMMITTED TO BUILDING THE STATE WIDE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NEEDED TO. AB ACCOUNTABLE ALL- HOUSE PROJECTS THAT INCLUDES- ADDING DATA ELEMENTS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY NOT COLLECTED- IN OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAM KNOWN AS FUSION. PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A HOLISTIC SERVICES ALONG WITH HOUSING- THAT- MEETS CLEARY ACT REPORTING TITLE NINE AMONGST OTHER KEY ELEMENTS THAT STUDENTS RELY ON. AND LASTLY THE BARRIERS THAT MANY OF OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE ARE ROOTED IN POVERTY AND SOCIAL ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGES MOST OF WHICH- MANIFEST IN HOUSING AND SECURITY SO MOVING TO AN ERA MOVING FROM A RIGHT TO FAIL ERA TO A STUDENT SUCCESS ERA EMBRACES THE VISION FOR SUCCESS REQUIRES RETHINKING AND EXPANDING. NONACADEMIC SERVICES AND SUPPORTS SUCH A STUDENT HOUSING SO WE COMMEND YOUR EFFORTS AND INVESTMENTS STUDENT HOUSING AND ARE READY TO PARTNER AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR COLLEGES HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT WILL GO TO CSU. GOOD MORNING THE VIRUS AND ONE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR CAPITAL PLANNING DESIGN CONSTRUCTION FOR THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY. THE CSU ASKED THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROVE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION SO JUST UNDER FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION. OF THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION ENVISIONED OF THE MULTI YEAR PROGRAM FOR THE CSU. THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION IS- ENVISIONED OVER THREE YEARS SO WE ARE ASKING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ADVANCING DOLLARS AHEAD OF THE YEAR ONE AND TWO AND INTO A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR THREE. THE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION IS COMPRISED OF FUNDING FOR NEW PROJECTS OF THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION. AND FIFTY MILLION TO BEGIN A NEW DIRECT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS. SO THAT THE- SHEET THAT'S BEEN HANDED OUT IS THE- OBJECTS WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR APPROVAL ON. THE FIRST TWO PROJECTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RECOMMENDATION AND THE REMAINING PROJECTS FOLLOWED BOARD OF TRUSTEES PRIORITIES AND YOU CAN SEE ON THIS FOR SPREAD SHEET THE BOARD CONSIDERED. THE SINCE START DATE THE AMOUNT OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AT THE CAMPUS THE BED CAPACITY THE CAMPUS AS FAR AS FACTORS THAT DROVE THOSE PROJECTS TO BE A HIGHER PRIORITY IBC IS ARE THE TOP PRIORITY CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERSEGMENT APPROACH TAKEN BY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE SPREADSHEET SHOWS THAT THE CSU WAS PROPOSING CO FUNDING SO THE STATE GRANT FUNDS WOULD LEVERAGE CSU FUNDS AND IT WOULD ENABLE THE COST PER BED TO BE REDUCED BY FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR BED. SO WITH THE AFFORDABLE STUDENT GRANT FUNDING THE COST PER BED REDUCES TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND PER BED. IN THE SPLIT BETWEEN THE GRANT FUNDS AND CSU FUNDING WOULD BE 65% GRANT FUNDING 35% C. S. USE OF BOND FINANCING. THE SECOND THE CSU PROPOSES THE STATUE BE BROADENED TO ALLOW FOR RENOVATIONS TO INCREASE OCCUPANT DENSITY IN EXISTING FACILITIES. AND THE IDEA THAT WE TARGET AN AMOUNT OF THE FUNDS TO PROVIDE HOUSING GRANTS DIRECTLY TO STUDENTS. SO IF ALLOWED RENOVATION PROJECTS COULD BE SUBMITTED FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THE THIRD YEAR OF THE PROGRAM. END OF WE'VE PROVIDED TO COMMITTEE STAFF A STRIKE THROUGH ON PROPOSED DETAILS ON STATUTE CHANGES FOR THE USE. THE RENOVATIONS WE WOULD PROMOTE OR THOSE PROJECTS WHICH ALLOW US TO INCREASE DENSITY TO GO FROM TWO BEDS TO THREE. AND PRIMARILY ADDRESS FIRE SPRINKLERS FIRE SAFETY NEEDS IN THE PROJECT EGRESS- AND ALARM SYSTEMS. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS CODE UPGRADES THAT ARE REQUIRED SO ENERGY EFFICIENCY. ADA BUT IN BY ALLOWING RENOVATION PROJECTS TO BE. ELIGIBLE IT WOULD REDUCE THE COST FOR BED. THE SECOND CHANGE IN STATUTE WOULD ALLOW THIS PORTION OF GRANT FUNDS TO BE USED FOR DIRECT GRANTS. FIFTY MILLION IS THE NUMBER WE'RE LOOKING AT IN WEEK WOULD RUN ADDITIONAL NUMBERS LOOKING AT- HOW WE WOULD SET UP AN ENDOWMENT FUND. THAT THE THOUGHT IS TO REDUCE THE COST. TO MEET THE STATUTE REQUIREMENT THE 30% TO FIFTY PERCENT. AND OF AN NFL ENABLE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE VACANCY. TWO IT OFFER THOSE STUDENTS BEDS NOW SO THEY COULD BE OFFERED AS SOON AS FALL VERSUS HAVING TO WAIT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION. WHICH WOULD GO OUT POLICE MAYBE FALL OF TWENTY FIVE SO THERE'D BE IMMEDIATE BENEFIT TO STUDENTS IF. HE WERE TO AGREE. IT ALSO ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CERTAINTY ISSUES RAISED BY THE LA- WITH THE RISK OF CONSTRUCTION AND THE COST ESCALATION THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR TO WEST 8% SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. THEY WERE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE THAT FOR THE PROJECTS WITHIN THE GRANT FUNDING. THE PLAN WOULD BE FOR ALL STUDENTS ALL STUDENTS TO USE THEIR FEDERAL AND STATE. FINANCIAL AID FIRST. AND LOOK AT THOSE STUDENTS WITH STILL REMAINING UNMET NEEDS BEFORE THEY'D HAVE TO TAKE OUT A LOAN. SO THIS APPROACH WOULD BE POTENTIAL YEAH NOT ONLY THE FASTER BENEFIT BUT IT INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT SUPPORTS OUR GRAD IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BALANCES OUT AVAILABILITY SO WE'RE WE HAVE BEDS AGAINST. AFFORDABILITY AND SOME BEDS ARE ARE OPEN NOW OWNER OCCUPANCY RATES ARE LOW BECAUSE OF CODED SO WE HAVE SOME FALSELY LOW. VACANCY RATES BUT WE HAVE CAMPS THE DO HAVE VACANCIES THAT WE COULD OFFER VERY QUICKLY. SO IN SUMMARY THE CSU REQUEST IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY MILLION FOR A COMBINATION OF NEW PROJECTS AND THE NEW DIRECT STUDENT GRANT PROGRAM. THANK YOU SEE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING TERM ACCARDI CHAIR TANG MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M SAY EVER TENANTS SPEAKING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA VIEWS AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING IS A KEY COMPONENT OF AN AFFORDABLE EDUCATION ACCESS TO SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ALLOW STUDENTS TO FOCUS ON THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS AVAILABILITY OF CAMPUS HOUSING PROVIDES STUDENTS WITH OPTIONS OF LIVING BOTH ON OR OFF CAMPUS EITHER ONE ADDITIONALLY UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S FOUND A LINK BETWEEN STUDENT RETENTION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FIRST YEAR HOUSING. SINCE MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE LOCATED IN VERY HIGH COST RENTAL AREAS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BEGAN TO STUDENT HOUSING INITIATIVE- THIS INITIATIVE HOW THE GOAL OF PROVIDING FOURTEEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL NEW STUDENT HOUSING BEDS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AND IT WAS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AND BY- FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAD EXCEEDED THE GOAL AND PROVIDED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND NEW STUDENT HOUSING BEDS ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. CAMPUSES ARE PLANNING ON CONTINUING TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF STUDENT HOUSING AND OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS PLANNING TO CONSTRUCT ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENT BEDS ACROSS OUR CAMPUSES. OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ST IS STRATEGICALLY UTILIZING A VARIETY OF- FINANCING VEHICLES FOR STUDENT HOUSING. TO SECURE LOW COST FINANCING AND TRANSFERRED THAT INTO A GREATER AFFORDABILITY. IN A RECENT STUDENT HOUSING EXPANSION WE USE BOTH LIMITED REVENUE LIMITED PROJECT REVENUE BONDS AND PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ARE P. THREES TO FINANCE PROJECTS. BECAUSE INTEREST RATES WERE LOW UNTIL RECENTLY WE WERE ABLE TO FINANCE PROJECTS AT 3% OR LESS- BEFORE INTEREST RATES START RISING- IT COST YOU SEE AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BED TO COMPLETE A NEW HOUSING PROJECT. THAT EQUATED TO ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION FOR EVERY FOUR HUNDRED NEW CAMPUS HOUSING BEDS ADDED TO THE SYSTEM. AS INTEREST RATES AND INFLATION RISE WE EXPECT THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION TO ALSO INCREASE. THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WILL PROVIDE STATE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING CONSTRUCTION THESE GRANT FUNDS WILL ASSIST IN KEEPING THE PROJECT UP TO A MINIMUM. OFFERING MORE LOW INCOME STUDENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAMPUS OPTIONS- THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY THIRD AND THE FIRST APPLICATIONS WERE DUE ON OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST- DESPITE THAT VERY TIGHT TURNAROUND SIX CAMPUSES SUBMITTED PROJECTS- FOR A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN GRANT FUNDING. THE CONSTRUCT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NEW STUDENT BEDS- WE RANK THESE PROJECTS BASED ON THE STATE COST PER BED WHEN WE SENT THEM OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THEIR REVIEW OF THESE PROJECTS AND REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA PROJECTS RECOMMENDED FOR FUNDING- THESE INCLUDE A THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT TO UCLA TO CONSTRUCT THREE HUNDRED. FIFTY EIGHT NEW BEDS THE PROJECT WILL HAVE A CAMPUS MATCH OF TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- OF THE ANTICIPATED OCCUPANCY WILL BEGIN IN FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR GRANT TO UC SAN DIEGO TO CONSTRUCT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHT NEW BEDS- THAT THAT PROJECT WILL HAVE A CAMPUS MATCH OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION- AND ANTICIPATED OCCUPANCY BEGINNING IN FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THINK THEY'RE HIKING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF MUNGER HALL. YES HOPEFULLY YOU COULD STILL HEAR WATER OPPOSE THE MUNGER HALL. WHAT IT WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THAT. MUNGER HALL I DID SUPPORT- OR OPPOSE MUNGER HALL THERE THANKING I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY OPPOSED TO ALMOST EVERYTHING. THE HER- AND THEN IN ADDITION UC MERCED- JOINTLY WITH MERCED COMMUNITY COLLEGE RECEIVED A PLANNING GRANT OF FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS- BY STATUTE UC'S ELIGIBLE 420% OF THE- HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT. FOR THAT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT MEANS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN- GRANTS DO YOU SEE IN THIS FIRST YEAR WE APPLIED FOR SIX HUNDRED MILLION SO WE ARE ALREADY OVER PRESCRIBED BY TWO HUNDRED MILLION JUST WITH YOU SEE PROJECTS- IN ADDITION TO THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING A ZERO INTEREST REVOLVING LOAN FUND. FOR STUDENTS STAFF AND FACULTY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION SUCH A REVOLVING LOAN FUND COULD PROVIDE YOU SEE WITH LONG TERM SUSTAINED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING BY ALLOWING TO UNIVERSITY TO REDEPLOY THE PRINCIPAL. PAYMENTS ON NEW PROJECTS AND PROVIDE SAVINGS ON THE INTEREST EXPENSE TO THE STUDENTS THE FORM OF LOWER RENT- OR FINANCIAL AID AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE- TO ENSURE THAT THE PROPOSED FUND WORKS OPERATIONALLY FOR OUR CAMPUSES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU. SAYS TESTING MY PATIENCE WE HAVE LOTS OF NOISE IN THE HALLWAY LOTS OF HONKING AT THEIR OLD WINDOWS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE SHOW GOES ON SO STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE FACING OUR STRUGGLE SO WE CAN DEAL WITH THIS IN HERE. SO I WANT TO START BY ASKING EACH- FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A BIG ISSUE THAT WE'RE KNOWLEDGE IN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY CALIFORNIA. MAYBE THE STATE SHOULD GET. INVOLVED IN STUDENT HOUSING WE JUST LET IT HAPPEN ON ITS OWN. AND OBVIOUSLY THE UC AND CSU HAVE A MAJOR PRIORITY BECAUSE YOUR- UNDERGRADUATES LIVE ON CAMPUS COMMUNITY COLLEGES NOT SO MUCH. AS TRADITIONALLY BEEN COMMUTERS SOME CAMPUSES HAVE STUDENT HOUSING. BUT I THINK THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BECAUSE OF THE- HOUSING CRISIS OVERALL AND JUST THE FACT THAT HOUSING COSTS SO MUCH OF THE STUDENTS- YOU KNOW THE LOAD OF STUFF THAT FOR DEBT LOAD OF STUDENTS AND JUST YOU KNOW- DEMAND ON CAMPUSES THAT WE NEED TO STEP UP AND FOCUS ON STUDENT HOUSING SO WE DECIDED TO DO THAT THE QUESTION IS AS THE L. A. O. SAID YOU KNOW WHAT DO WE DO WITH OUR RESOURCES I THINK LAST YEAR- I KNOW MR TANG WAS TALK ABOUT THIS TO BE PUT MONEY FOR NEW HOUSING AND EXPANSION BUT JUST FOCUSING ON JUST THE HOUSING FOR A SECOND WE PUT. THE MONEY LAST YEAR FOR A 100% OF THE MONEY TO FUND THE FUND FOR PROJECTS WHICH IS GREAT FOR THE WINNERS BUT WE'RE PICKING A FEW WINNERS AMBER PICKING A LOT OF LOSERS I'M THINKING ABOUT LIKE YOU KNOW I KNOW I HAVE TWO TEENAGE GIRLS SAYS MR O'DONNELL SAYS MR TAN IF WE WENT TO EACH ONE OF OUR KIDS GAVE ONE AN AMAZING PRESENT AND THE OTHER. SORRY I DON'T HAVE A FOR YOU OR GIVE EACH OF THEM A GOOD PRESENT SO I'M I'M I'M THINKING THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD RETHINK THIS AND NOT GIVE A 100% THE PROJECTS BUT GIVE 20% OR JUST- DOING PROPOSING ARE LEGISLATION THIS YEAR AND DO 100% ZERO INTEREST- LOANS SO WE CAN PICK MORE PROJECTS AND NOT YOU KNOW- PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS SO. AND WE SEE THIS THE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE THE APPLICATIONS FOR WE HAD TONS OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE SORRY WE YOU KNOW GET YOU NEXT TIME AND WE PROBABLY WON'T GET THAT IF YOU GO WITH THE STATUS QUO OF MY PLAN SO I GUESS MY QUESTION STARTING FOR EACH SEGMENT IS IF YOU WOULD YOU PREFER. TO HAVE A 100% FINANCING FOR A FEW OF YOUR PROJECTS OR HAVE IT MORE BROAD AND HAVE YOU KNOW- HALF THE GRANT OR OR USE IT FOR A HUNDRED PERCENT- ZERO INTEREST ON LIKE I KNOW SOME UC CHANCELLORS ARE ARE RECOMMENDING SO IF YOU COULD NOT PICKING AT EACH SEGMENT START WITH THAT SOURCE. CSU PICTURE. THIS IS SO LOOKING AT THE PROPOSED SUB OF THE FOR MILLION I THINK OPTIMALLY WE WOULD HAVE PROPOSED EQUIVALENT OF A SIX HUNDRED BED NEW CONSTRUCTION WHICH IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO EIGHTY MILLION AND IF WE COULD HAVE SIX HUNDRED BEDS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM FOR STUDENTS IT WOULDN'T MATTER WHICH CAMPUS IT WAS SO WE COULD WE COULD PROVIDE STUDENT HOUSING GRANTS AFTER THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AFTER CAL GRANT BE AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY AND WE COULD HIT. AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO NO MAY EAST BAY BAKERSFIELD SAMBAR DINO WHERE THERE HAVE SOME ENROLLMENT CHALLENGES. AND MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP THEM LET ME ASK THE QUESTION IF MAYBE HE COMES MAYBE I DIDN'T SAY IT CORRECTLY SO. IF I HAD. A BAG HERE. OF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR CSU. WOULD YOU RATHER. TAKE THAT IN FUND LET'S SAY FIVE PROJECTS AT A 100% AT FIVE YOU'RE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES OR- YOU KNOW- PARTIALLY FIND MORE PROJECTS SO THEY COULD ALL MORE BE FINANCIALLY VIABLE WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU. WHAT WOULD YOU DO. SET SO WHAT WE DID WAS PROPOSE THE HEAD OF PERCENT FUNDING BUT IN ORDER TO SPREAD THE DOLLARS WE PUT IN CO FUNDING OF 35% SO WE COULD HIT MORE CAMPUSES YOU STILL LIKE 100% FUNDING. IT CERTAINLY MAKES IT EASY EASIER FOR CAMPUS PROCEED. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER BACARDI- GIVEN THE ORIGINAL PROMISE OF REALLY FOCUSING ON AFFORDABILITY THE- THE PROPOSAL INITIAL PROPOSAL OF A 100% FUNDING WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT DISTRICTS DELIVER ON THE PROJECT PROVIDE AFFORDABLE RENTS THAT REALLY DELIVERS ON THAT COMMITMENT SO TO YOUR QUESTION I REALLY DO THINK THAT IT'S A BOTH AND SO REMAINING WITH THE COMMITMENT OF PROVIDING A 100% FUNDING FOR THREE ROUNDS OF GRANTS AND IF NEW ONE TIME DOLLARS ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET UNDER SURPLUS CONDITIONS OR OTHER- INVESTING IN NEW PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOVEL READY AND CAN MOVE FORWARD. BUT ALSO HAVING AN AND- ELEMENT TO YOUR PROPOSAL WHERE AS YOU'RE LOOKING LONG TERM AT THIS SEVENTY FIVE OTHER PLANNING GRANTS ARE COMING FORWARD CONSIDERING WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM SUCH AS AT LOW TO NO COSTS INTEREST LOANS SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE STATE COULD HAVE A LONG TERM STRATEGY AS WELL TO ADDRESSING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WOULD PREFER TO FIND FEWER PROJECTS WITH GREATER SUBSIDY TEND TO SPREAD THE FUNDING ACROSS MORE PROJECTS. BECAUSE STOCK WAY OF WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE A- GREATER NUMBER OF LOW COST UNITS WITHIN THE HOUSING. ARE PROJECTS BEING PROPOSED. AT THE EXISTING STATUTE REQUIRES THAT DEAL- LOW INCOME RENTAL UNITS WITH IN THOSE HOUSING PROJECTS BE OFFERED AT 15% OF HALF OF THE MEDIAN INCOME OF FOR THAT AREA. WHERE TO CAMPUS IS LOCATED AND THAT MEANS THAT THE RENTAL RATES FOR THOSE ROOMS ARE FORCED TO BE QUITE LOW- UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DID PUT FORWARD THREE PROJECTS THAT HAVE NO- FINANCIAL VIABILITY IF THEY DO NOT RECEIVE. THE FULL STATE GRANT THAT WAS BEING REQUESTED SO WE ARE REQUESTING- GREATER FUNDING FOR FUTURE PROJECTS THANK YOU. AND WHAT WOULD THE L. A. L. YOUR MOVE YOUR HAND OVER THERE SO I JUST TO SHARPEN THAT POINT ON THAT YOU MADE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY- THE STATUE DID NOT SET FORTH SPECIFIC GUIDELINES ON FUND MATCHING. AND SO ALL THE APPLICATIONS VERY QUITE A BIT IN TERMS OF WHETHER WAS A 100% STATE FUNDING OR A MIX OF STATE FUNDING AND ON STATE FUNDING CSU TOOK A PRETTY BLANKET APPROACH OF DOING 65% STATE 35% NONSTATE. BROTHER SEGMENTS THE CAMPUS IS VERY QUITE A BIT- IF THAT IS OF INTEREST TO YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPREAD FUNDING OVER MORE PROJECTS TO PROTECT. POTENTIALLY COVER MORE PROJECTS MORE CAMPUSES. A ONE STATUTORY CHANGE YOU COULD CONSIDER IS- SETTING FORTH SPECIFIC FUND MATCHING GUIDELINES LIKE. 20% OR 30% OF THE COST WOULD BE. COVERED THROUGH NON STATE FUNDS SO THAT THAT IS AN OPTION TO THE LEGISLATURE IF IT IF IT DID WANT TO SPREAD. SPREAD MORE FUNDS OVER MORE PROJECTS. FOR OKAY. QUESTIONS MISTREATING. SO JUST JUST A SECOND A POINT FOR ONE SECOND I THINK- IT SEEMS THAT THE SEGMENTS WOULD LIKE TO. HAVE THE GREATER SUBSIDY OR THE TWO SEGMENTS LIKE THAT THE GREATER SUBSEA JUST BECAUSE THEN HAS GREATER CERTAINTY OF THE PROJECT BEING COMPLETED VERSES- IF YOU DON'T HAVE A POT OF MONEY TO ADD TO THAT PROJECT THEN YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND SEARCH FOR THAT MONEY RIGHT SO I THINK- ONE ME WHAT WE COULD DO IS. THAT THE SEGMENTS DECIDE SAY CSU'S DECIDED HEY THEY HAD THEY WERE ABLE TO. PROVIDE 35% THEY CAN LEVERAGE THAT OTHER MONEY OTHERS TWO SEGMENTS DECIDED NOT TO RESIGN. FEREBEE COMFORT CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT THE WHAT WAS SAID. SINGH IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GOOD- SO- REGARDING JUST SORT OF- GOOD JUST GOING TO YOU SEE FOR ONE QUICK SECOND SO YOU UCLA- WAS ABLE TO ANNOUNCE THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE SCHOOL'S HISTORY THEY ARE ABLE TO OFFER- ENTERING FRESHMEN FOUR YEARS OF HOUSING WHICH I THINK WAS A FAIRLY FAIRLY HISTORIC- STEP IN SO- COULD YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT ESPECIALLY IN AN AREA THAT IS VERY. URBAN VERY INFILL IS NOT MERCED IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BUILD IN THE WESTERN PART OF LOS ANGELES COULD YOU BE TO WALK US THROUGH HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO KIND OF ACHIEVE THAT GOAL MAYBE WHY WHY OTHER UC'S WEREN'T ABLE TO. OF THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SIR- UCLA WAS ABLE TO CONSTRUCT FIVE THOUSAND DORMITORY BEDS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER FROMTHE CAMPUS IN THE HILLS THAT WERE- STILL ON OCT UNOCCUPIED LAND- AND UCLA HAS- USED IN MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE USED A LOT OF P. THREE PROJECTS. WHICH- MEAN THAT THE CAMPUS OWNS THE LAND- A DEVELOPER BUILDS THE BUILDING AND THE DEVELOPERS COLLECTING THE RENTAL PAYMENTS FROM THE STUDENTS IN ORDER TO PAY THEMSELVES BACK FOR THE CONSTRUCTION- P. THREE DORMITORIES SOMETIMES MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER RENTS THE NON P. THREE DORMITORIES- NOT ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE HAD THE- OPPORTUNITY TO FIND LAND THAT IS. UNOCCUPIED NEAR CAMPUS AND- D. DUST ABOLITION OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS DOES TAKE TIME TO GET THAT P. THREE FINANCING GOT IT IN WITHIN WITH P. THREES- AND I GUESS FOR THE TRANSLATION PREVIOUS PREVIOUS OUR PRIVATE PRIVATE DEVELOPERS YES PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP RIGHT NOW CORRECT THANK YOU- IN SO FOR. UCLA IN PARTICULAR FOR THOSE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS- THE RENTS WILL PROBABLY BE CLOSER TO MARKET THAN THEY WOULD IF IT WAS A STATE COMPLETELY STATE SUBSIDIZED- PROPERTY WHICH I IMAGINE WOULD HAVE LOWER RENTS. I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME WHAT THE RENT IS FOR THOSE DORMITORIES I CAN GET THAT FOR YOU BUT I DO KNOW THAT ALL OUR CAMPUSES WE STRIVE TO HAVE. RENTS EITHER ACT MARKET OR BELOW MARKET UP 220% BELOW MARKET. GODDESS OF STUDENTS WERE DIRECTED SAY TO THOSE P. THREE. PROPERTIES THEY WOULD NECESSARILY FEEL A DIFFERENCE THAN. THE OTHER UCLA HOUSING UNITS. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY- AND YOU JUST GO INTO LA- REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE POINTS THAT YOU RAISED ON I MEAN THERE'S A COUPLE. COUPLE ISSUES. PART PART OF THIS HOUSING PART OF MONEY THAT- THE ASSEMBLY ADVOCATED FOR WHICH WE WERE NOT ABLE TO. GET INTO THE AGREEMENT WAS NOT ONLY WITH HIS HOUSING MONEY. BUT THIS COULD BE USED FOR CAMPUS EXPANSION- AS AS WE SAW FROM THIS UC BERKELEY CASE- WE'VE BEEN ASKING ALL THE SEGMENTS OFF ALL THREE SEGMENTS TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT TO INCREASE CAPACITY WE HAVE A TWO MILLION. DEGREE SHORTFALL IN IT'S IMPORTANT AT ALL THREE. SEGMENTS INCREASED CAPACITY WELL HOUSING IS A VERY CRITICAL PIECE OF THAT OBVIOUSLY. YOU CAN'T INCREASE CAPACITY IF YOU DON'T MORE CLASSROOMS MORE FACULTY MORE. PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SO I THINK. THAT'S THE PART THAT I THINK IS ALSO. A POTENTIALLY MISSING HERE SO I DON'T KNOW IF EL AL HAS. DONE ANY ANALYSIS OR THOUGHTS- I DO I DO- I DO FEEL THE- ISSUES THAT L. A. REYES AS CRY TO. MORE YOU TO FULLY CONSIDER AROUND- THE ABILITY TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT CAPACITY- IF THE HOUSING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY- OBVIOUSLY IF HOUSING IS ALREADY CHEAPER PLENTIFUL IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S MAYBE THE BEST PLACE TO BUILD MORE. MORE HOUSING- ALTHOUGH- ALTHOUGH FOR SOME YOU KNOW HARDER TO REACH SPECIALLY FOR COMMUNICABLE JUST HARDER TO REACH REGIONS- WHERE YOU KNOW A COMMUTE MAY BE A TWO HOUR COMMUTE NOT A TWENTY MINUTE COMMUTE. OBVIOUSLY WE DO HAVE TO FACTOR THAT IN SO THAT THAT COULD BE ANOTHER FACTOR- I DON'T BELIEVE SHOVEL READY WAS SORT OF A FACTOR. IS THAT MY RIGHT EXACT COUNT OKAY NOT NOT A THANK YOU. AND THEN ALSO- HELPING ALONG WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE ROMA CAPACITY INCREASES ALSO TO SORT OF. ABILITY TO DO THE CAMPUS EXPANSION SO JUST GOING TO- FINANCE- WERE. YOU KNOW IS ESERVER HERE GOING INTO THIS SORT OF NEXT VERSION I THINK WITH ANY WITH ANY FIRST YEAR WE LEARNED A LOT WE SEE A LOT. YOU KNOW AND I THINK IT'S GREAT I'M I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT THIS GOT. ALSO GOT OFF THE GROUND. WE'RE SEEING THEIR PROJECTS WE'RE SEEING A HUGE DEMAND FOR PROJECTS BUT JUST GOING TO FINANCE FOR SECOND. WHAT WHAT ABOUT YOU KNOW FURTHER CONSIDERING SOME OF THESE. FACTORS AND ALSO AGAIN ONE OF THE CRITIQUES OF LA- WAS THAT THE FACTORS WEREN'T- SORT OF WIDELY PUBLICIZED BEFORE THE- APPLICATIONS WERE IN WHICH I UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S WE'RE TRYING TO BE FAST. SO I'M NOT THAT'S NOT A- CRITIQUE IS JUST A IT KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL PRIORITIZE RE PRIORITIZE SPEED THIS YEAR WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT. I GIVE YOUR HOUSE A SHORT BUT WHAT WHAT ABOUT IRAN THE CAPACITY. HOUSING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS AS WELL AS YOU KNOW PRIORITIZING PROJECTS THAT ARE READY READY TO GO. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT- QUESTION. I CHAIR TANG- SO WE'VE FIRST NOTE THAT- OUR REVIEW OF THESE APPLICATIONS WAS. REALLY BASED IN IN THE STATUTE- AND NAMELY YOU KNOW ONE OF THAT. THE TO BEING- CONSTRUCTION COSTS PER BED WHICH IS REALLY AN EFFICIENCY METRICS- AND THEN RAN TO WHICH WAS. REALLY THE KEEP COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM RIGHT IS STUDENT AFFORDABILITY- AND IN TERMS OF THE OP OPTIONS THAT YOU'VE PLAYED. SOME OF THEM BEING- YOU KNOW. THINGS NOTED IN STATUTE YET YUP YEAH NOT REQUIRED IN TERMS OF OUR OUR EVALUATION- IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING- SO THE THINGS THAT WE ARE ARE IN STATURE THAT WE COULD HAVE CONSIDERED. ABOLITION STATUTE WE DIDN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AT THIS TIME- BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS A- THOUGHT ABOUT- FURTHER EXPANDING THE CRITERION TO THOSE AREAS AS WELL AS WITH THE SEGMENTS MIGHT. THINK ABOUT THAT FINANCE NOTED ACTUALLY HAD SEVEN SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED. AND THEY LARGELY ALIGNED WITH A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED AROUND IN AS A SHOVEL READY. ENROLLMENT CAPACITY- IT ALSO INCLUDES OPTIONS LIKE CONSIDERING THE SHARE OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT ARE IMPACTED AT A PARTICULAR CAMPUS. THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERED JUST ONE OF THESE FACTORS WHICH WAS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE PROJECT WAS ANDERSON METAL AND GIVE. HIGH PRIORITY TO THAT ANY INTERSEGMENT A PROJECT THAT WAS ELIGIBLE IMMEDIATELY GOT RANKS NUMBER ONE. I DIDN'T EXPLICITLY CONSIDER THESE OTHER FACTORS AND SO- YOU KNOW IF THESE ARE FACTORS THAT ARE OF PRIORITY TO LEGISLATURE IT COULD CONSIDER. INCORPORATING THEM INTO THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH OR COULD IT COULD DO IT IN LIEU ONCE SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S METHODOLOGY. I GET A TON OF DEPENDS ON- WHICH OF THESE SORT OF METRICS ARE OF PARTY THE LEGISLATURE IN WHICH SORT OF A LANGUAGE IN SCHOOLS. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH STAFF ON EXPORT OTHER OPTIONS IN THE IN THE COMING MONTHS- COULD NOT GO BACK TO FINANCE WITHIN THE OTHER. THEIR OTHER FACTORS IN. THE STATUE WAS A REASON THAT THOSE WERE NOT PART OF THE- ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT. YEAH I THINK FOR US IT WAS AGAIN LIKE GOING BACK TO THE STATUTE I THINK THAT WAS THE MAIN CONCERN AND THEN ADDITIONALLY WE WHAT WE NEEDED TO EVALUATE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSISTENT ACROSS. ALL APPLICATIONS AND SO CONSTRUCTION COSTS PER BED WAS IN A- YOU KNOW THE SAME METRIC RIGHT DOLLAR U. S. DOLLAR TO BED. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY THE RENT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE REQUIRED VERY SPECIFICALLY IN STATURE AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO GAUGE WHAT THEY ARE. THEIR MAXIMUM COST WAS ABLE TO BE AND THEN WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT COST- THEY REACH TO THAT WAS A CONSISTENT MEASURE ACROSS ALL APPLICATIONS. REBECCA'S CONSTRUCTION COSTS- IS GOING TO VARY. WIDELY ACROSS THE STATE I MEAN CONSTRUCTION COSTA SAN FRANCISCO VERSUS. CONSTRUCTION COSTS IN CHESTER ARE. YOU KNOW THE MUCH WILL BE A TWO STATES SITES I THINK I THINK. WE WANT WE WANT TO USE THE MONEY EFFICIENTLY I TOLD WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. HAVING FINANCIAL METRICS BUT I DO. BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO. LOOK AT SOME IS OTHER FACTORS AS WELL- IN AND HAVING SAID THAT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE PLENTY OF GOOD PROJECTS I DON'T THINK I WILL YOU KNOW AND JUST JUST TAKING A SCAN OF THESE PROJECTS THAT THE- U. S. LOOKS LIKE MANY OF THESE MOST THESE PROJECTS ARE VERY GOOD SO IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT A REALLY MATTER IF IT'S MEAN TO ME IT'S REALLY MATTER FOUGHT WHEN AND HOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE HELP SUPPORT. GETTING THESE PROGRAMS OFF THE GROUND. I DON'T KNOW IF THE SEGMENTS HAD ANY. ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THE CRITERION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY. CHIANG I THINK CSU IF WE HAD KNOWN THAT. ONE OF THE CRITERIA WOULD BE HOW FAR BELOW THE 30% 250% WE COULD HAVE FASHIONED. OUR USE OF THE 30% DIFFERENTLY. AND SWUNG THAT METRIC. YEAH I THOUGHT WE THOUGHT THE CONSTRUCTION START DATE WAS ONE OF THE KEY DRIVERS BASED ON THE IMMEDIACY AND THE PRIORITY. SO THAT WAS ONE OF OUR FACTORS AND CUTTING UP WHICH PROJECTS. THANK YOU. I'LL JUST ADD A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS I THINK THERE ARE SOME DEFINITE OPPORTUNITY COSTS THAT ARE. REALLY WORTH CONSIDERING SOME OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN INCLUDED WHICH IS- IF THE CONCERN IS HOW QUICKLY THE STATE CAN DELIVER ON AFFORDABLE PROJECTS REALLY LOOKING AT. THE ABILITY OF A OF A PROJECT TO DELIVER IS KEY- BOTH IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION TIMELINE- AND IN THE COMMITMENT- THE OTHER- CONSIDERATIONS LOOKING DOWN THE LINE ARE- SOME OF THE COMMUNITY FACTORS OF WHO IS SERVED. AND THEY COST OF RENTS IN THAT REGION COMPARED TO- THE RENT THAT IS PROPOSED IN THESE PROJECTS OF THOSE ARE SOME VIABLE ONES. THAT ALSO ARE. TO THE AFFORDABILITY VALUES OF THIS PROGRAM. AND THOSE WERE EXCELLENT COMMENTS ALL JUST ADD THAT- FIRST UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S OVERSUBSCRIBED WITH ALL THE PROJECTS WE ALREADY PUT FORWARD. I DO THINK THAT IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO COMPARE OF REGIONAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS RATHER THAN ALL THE CONSTRUCTION COST. OF ALL THE PROJECTS AGAINST EACH OTHER BECAUSE COSTS CAN VARY SO GREATLY ACROSS THE STATE AND ALSO GIVEN- DIRECTION OF INFLATION RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT THE ABILITY OF THE CAMPUS TO PROVIDE. NON STATE FUNDING FOR CONTINGENCY COSTS AND ALSO CONSTRUCTION START DATE MAY BE BENEFICIAL. I DON'T KNOW THE SEGMENTS HAD ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT- I KNOW WHAT AREA WE DIDN'T COVER WAS AROUND- PAYING FOR BUILDINGS TO GREATER EXPAND OUR CAPACITY AS AS AS THE CAMPUSES ARE LOOKING AT CLASSROOM SPACE AND BUILDING I DON'T KNOW IF THE SEGMENT ANY COMMENTS ABOUT. THE NEED FOR OUR CAPITAL MONEY TO INCREASE CAPACITY OF CLASSROOMS AND LABS SIX THAT ARE YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT ALL THE ALL THE EDUCATIONAL- THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE NEEDED. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS A FIVE YEAR FINANCING PLAN CAPITAL FINANCING PLAN THAT CONTAINS OVER EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN POTENTIAL OF ACADEMIC CONSTRUCTION. PROJECTS TO ACCOMMODATE FUTURE ENROLLMENT GROWTH WE DO WANT TO GROW BY. TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS OR MORE OVER THE NEXT- FIVE YEARS AND- TO ACCOMMODATE THAT GROWTH WE WILL BE NEEDING NEW CLASSROOM SPACE. THANK YOU. SAYS CSU CUT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY ALSO HAS A FIVE YEAR PLAN IN A PRIORITY LIST THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN A NUMBER OF THE PROJECTS ARE ARE STEM RELATED PROJECTS AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST. SO THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE A NEED THAT WE'VE ADVOCATED FOR A LONG TIME ALONG WITH ONE TIME FUNDS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT WE HAVE GOT A NINE HUNDRED MILLION STILL OUTSTANDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR REQUEST. THANK YOU CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGES ARE CAPITAL OFF OUR FIVE YEAR CAPITAL OUTLAY PLAN IS FORTY TWO- BILLION- BUT ONE KEY FOCUS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. REALLY BEEN MODERNIZATION. AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ACROSS OUR SYSTEM THAT'S A KEY FOCUS. I WILL SHARE THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL WITHIN THE REGULATORY ROUND WE ARE LOOKING AT- THE ABILITY OF. THESE NEW HOUSING FACILITIES TO INTEGRATE. CLASSROOM AND STUDENT SUPPORT SPACES WITHIN THEM. SO THAT STUDENTS HAVE GREATER PROXIMITY- HAVE THAT AGAIN DIRECT CONNECTION TO STUDENT SUCCESS WHICH IS A KEY GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM. GREAT THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU ON THE SAME TOPIC WE'RE GONNA HAVE MISTER MEDINA AND THEN MISTER O'DONNELL SO TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WANT TO JUST KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND PAGE FOUR AND FIVE PAGE PAGE FOR ARE THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE. BEEN APPROVED ON THE AGENDA. YES THEY HAVE BEEN PROPOSED THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT YEAH AS APPROVED. RIGHT AND THEN PAGE FIVE. ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE ESERVER PLANNING GRANTS THAT WE HAVE PROPOSAL LEGISLATURE YES OKAY WELL I JUST WANTED TO UP ON THE CHAIR ABOUT THE CHILDREN BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE CHILDREN WHO DIDN'T GET A PRESENT. IN AND LOOKING AT. AT THE EIGHT PROJECTS- ON THE LIST THAT ARE FUNDED. RIGHT I DO NOT SEE ANYTHING- IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND AS A CHILD DOESN'T GET A PRESIDENT AND DOESN'T ALWAYS OFTEN DOESN'T GET A PRESENT I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO AND I'M GLAD THAT OUR MAJORITY LEADER JUST CAME IN SO LET ME REPEAT AGAIN FOR MAJORITY LEADER- LOOKING AT THE LIST OF PROJECTS THAT ARE FUNDED. OF THE EIGHT THERE IS NOT IN THERE FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE AND I JUST- STATED THAT I FEEL LIKE THAT CHILD THAT ARE SHARED IS TALKING ABOUT WHO DOESN'T GET A PRESENT WE ARE OFTEN. THE CHILD GETS OVERLOOKED SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING MORE AS WE HAD THE MEETINGS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS PERTAINING TO HOUSING. IT IS- ISSUE AS ARE WE ALL KNOW THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WHEREVER WHETHER WE WERE. IN THE FRESNO OR- STOCKTON FOR RIVERSIDE OR SAN BERNARDINO HOUSING FOR STUDENTS IS AN ISSUE. AND I'D- THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE THANK. THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL THE RESEARCHER- AND I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S HERE MY COLLEAGUE IN SACRAMENTO WHO HAVE PUSHED FOR STUDENT HOUSING AND MONEY TO SUPPORT STUDENT HOUSING. ON ALL SEGMENTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF HARD WORK SO THE FACT THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY IS TO ACTUALLY A LOT OF THEIR THEIR HARD WORK. O THIS ACTUALLY GOOD THING BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE GET IT DONE I JUST HOPE WE CAN GET MONEY THERE'S MONEY OUT THERE WILL BE MORE YES- BUT THE NEED HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED NOW RESPONDING- SO THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING. AND JUST TO CLARIFY MAYBE THIS QUESTIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN PAGE FOR THOSE PROJECTS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THOSE A 100% FINANCED ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS NOW THEY'RE NOT OKAY- AND THEN THE PLANNING GRANTS. LANDERS THAT. AND I JUST WANNA GO TO THE TRADITIONAL METHOD MAYBE I'LL TAKE LONG BEACH STATE BECAUSE THAT'S THE PLACE I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH. AS ONE UNDERSTAND THIS- DORM ROOMS ARE AMONG THE STATE AND TRADITIONALLY THEY'VE BEEN BUILT. I ASSUME THAT. SOMEONE WOULD FLOAT A BOND I ASSUME. AND IT WE CREATE KIND OF AN ENTERPRISE FUND AN AGENCY WITHIN AN AGENCY IF YOU WILL. THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF STUDENT HOUSING AND THEY WOULD PAY THE BONDS. OFF THROUGH THE FEES THAT STUDENTS PAY TO LIVE THERE IS THAT ACCURATE. YES MEMBERS DONNA WE HAVE A SYSTEM WIDE REVENUE BONDS IT'S A PLEDGE OF SELF SUPPORT AND GENERAL FUND THAT WE USE FOR STUDENT HOUSING STUDENT UNIONS PARKING ACADEMIC BUILDINGS. HOW DO YOU USE P. THREES AT ALL. OR HAVE YOU HAVE WE HAVE USED P. THREES WE HAVE A RECENT ONE THAT JUST CAME UP THE SAN FRANCISCO. FOR THE STUDENT HOUSING YES THAT'S CORRECT FORTUNATELY- OKAY- WHAT WHAT ABOUT OF THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE OF ARE YOU CONTEMPLATING ANY TYPE OF P. THREES ARE. AFTER THE NEW. SO THEY PER- SEVENTY FIVE PLANNING SOME OF THESE DO HAVE PROPOSED P. THREES WE HAVE A COUPLE THAT ARE- EXPLORING SOMETHING CALLED P. FOUR WHICH IS A PUBLIC PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP SO IT OFTEN INCLUDES EITHER THEIR COUNTY OR THEIR CITY ALSO SUPPORTING THE PROJECTS THAT WE DO HAVE SOME OF THOSE AND WITHIN THE ELIGIBLE GRANTS- ONE OF THESE PROJECTS- IS PROPOSED AS- A P. THREE. SO THIS CALL NEXT QUESTIONS READY. UNDER THE P. THREE MODEL WITH THAT WOULD WOULD IT BE PRIVATELY OPERATED TO. I CAN SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE MODELS THAT WE'VE SEEN HERE IN THESE APPLICATIONS IS THAT THEY'RE OFTEN- THERE TWO APPROACHES ONE IS THAT THEY HELP IN TERMS OF THE FINANCING GET THE- PROJECT OFF THE GROUND- FOR THIS PROJECT IT STARTED WELL BEFORE. THE STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM FROM THE STATE SO THEY NEEDED THAT IN ORDER TO GET OFF THE GROUND SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE RESOURCES LOCALLY- OTHER MODELS THAT ALREADY EXISTS THAT ARE BUILT- AND OFFERED AT OUR CAMPUSES ONE IN ORANGE COUNTY- THEY WORK WITH THE P. THREE TO PROVIDE MAINTENANCE TO THE SUPPORT OF THE FACILITIES- BECAUSE THEY- HAVE- ON CAMPUS. OR AT STAFFING THE TRADITIONAL P. THREE MODEL ANOTHER CORRECT OKAY. GREAT ALL RIGHT I THINK THAT IS MY SUMS UP MY QUESTION ABOUT AGAIN I HOPE THAT AND I AND I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING I KNOW THAT BUT I HOPE WE LOOK ALTERNATIVE MODELS JUST OTHER THAN THE BOND RATHER IT OTHER THAN A 100% FINANCING QUITE FRANKLY ON HOW TO GET- THESE- HOUSING. UNITS BUILT SO THANK YOU. I HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHICH PROJECTS ARE A 100% STATE FUNDED AND WHICH ARE A MIX SO ABOUT FOUR OF THE EIGHT PROJECTS ARE I THOUGHT ABOUT FOR THE PROJECTS ARE A MIX OF STATE AND NON STATE FUNDED IN THE OTHER FOUR ARE A 100% STATE FUNDED. SO IT'S A MIX AND WITHIN THAT EIGHT THAT THAT ARE PROPOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION. THANK YOU. I JUST I KNOW I THINK THIS. QUESTION JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP- WE'RE VERY LEERY TO THAT. BECAUSE THAT JUST MEANS MORE THAN LIKELY IT'S- NEW YORK WALL STREET INVESTMENT COMPANIES MAKING MONEY OFF THE PROJECT. BY SQUEEZING COMMUNICABLE STUDENTS WHO BY DEFINITION AS YOU STATED EARLIER. ARE THE POOREST AMONG THANK THE STUDENTS. AND SO THERE'S A THERE'S A BUILT IN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO INCREASE RENT. AND AND MAKE MONEY OFF THE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MY IN THE FIRST PLACE WHICH IS WHY FOR THE UC AND CSU WE LIKE THE MODEL WHERE THEY OWNED AND OPERATED BECAUSE THEN IT'S THE UNIVERSITY. THEY'RE TRYING TO COVER THEIR COSTS AND KEEP COSTS DOWN SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMUNICATORS DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE. TO DO THIS SO YOU NEED AN OUTSIDE PARTNER BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS YOU KNOW YEAR UP HERE ON A REGULAR BASIS TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU NEED HELP FOR YOUR STUDENTS WHO ARE SOMETIMES IN DIRE STRAITS. AND THIS MODEL MAY NOT NECESSARILY. HELP THE SAME STUDENTS RATE PROTECTING TO MISTER CARAVAN HELP YEAH I'M I'M GONNA CHALLENGE THAT A BIT I'M NOT GONNA SAY YOU'RE COMPLETELY WRONG NOR ARE YOU COMPLETELY CORRECT. I THINK IF DONE CORRECTLY IF WRITTEN CORRECTLY YES GAVE SAFEGUARDS ARE PUT IN A P. THREE CAN BE THE RIGHT TOOL IT ISN'T ALWAYS THE RIGHT TOOL FOR SURE. BUT EVEN BOND AS A MECHANISM OF WALL STREET CORRECT CAN I GET YOUR POINT THAT IT REALLY NEEDS TO WATCH WE JUST CAN'T TURN A PIECE OF PUBLIC LAND. OVER TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND EXPECT THEM TO DO RIGHT BY THE STUDENTS THERE NEEDS TO BE AND WHEN THESE CONTRACTS ARE WRITTEN WHICH ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL. THERE NEEDS TO BE SIGNIFICANT. SAFEGUARDS AND MP THREES ARE NOT A PANACEA THEY'RE NOT IN OF THE HOLY GRAIL BUT I THINK THEY ARE TOOL IN SOME PLACES AT CERTAIN TIMES I. TO THIS IS BUT AGAIN ALWAYS. BUT AGAIN GOT TO BE DONE CORRECTLY IT IS CAN'T TURN IT OVER A LOT OF TIME IN THE P. THREE ENVIRONMENT. YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEM THEY HAND SOMETHING OVER TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WHAT HAPPENS IS EXACTLY. WHAT YOU STATED BUT AGAIN IF DONE CORRECTLY THEY CAN BE A TOOL TO- TO- TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. YEAH YEAH AND THEN THAT WE ARE WE HAVE THAT IN PLACE FOR THE UC AND CSU AND ONE KIND OF NEW ONES THERE AND MISTER JOHN YOU'RE CORRECT AS YOU CAN HAVE THAT P. THREE BILL DEBT LIKE SANTA SACKS STATED AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO THE UNIVERSITY TO OWN OPERATE AND THEREFORE THEY WILL KEEP THAT RENTS DOWN SO- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S SOMETHING KIND THE MIDDLE GROUND HERE TOO. I GUESS THE BIG PICTURE HERE IS THAT WE'RE OPENING A CAN OF WORMS ON THIS THIS HOUSING THING AND SELLS LIKE WHAT FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER THIS WHERE WE'RE SAYING HEY WE SHOULD GET IN THE BUSINESS OF HELPING- FOCUS ON HOUSING WE HAVE. YOU KNOW WHY WE HAVE A MASSIVE SURPLUS WE HAVE. LIMITED RESOURCES WE CAN'T UNLIMITED. DO EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT TO. ACCOMPLISH HERE SO HOW DO WE- MAXIMIZE. AND PICK AS MANY. WINNERS AS MR MEDINA TALKED ABOUT HIS COMMUTE THERE AND RIVERSIDE- MISTER DOCTOR CHOI DID YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP TO GO HEAD. I WAS WONDERING- IF FOR YOU HAVE DEVELOPED ANY PLAN ONCE A BUILDING IS IT IN PLACE ON. HOW SINCE WE HAVE TALK- WHAT THE- AFFORDABLE. THE CHILDREN HOUSING- DO YOU HAVE A PLAN AT THIS TIME- WHAT WILL BE PROPER WAY OF- ARE CHARGING. THE STUDENTS- OF WAS A LIVING IN THE WILL IT BE INCOME BASED A SCALE WAS IT WHAT WOULD IT BE. TAX RETURNS- AND THEN ALSO- YOU DO HAVE- SUBSTATION PERCENTAGE OF OUR STUDENTS ARE FROM ALL OVER SEIZE. DAY AND- OUT OF STATE AS WELL. WILL THEY QUALIFY EQUALITY OR WILL IT BE A DIFFERENT PLAN TOTAL CHARGE THEM BECAUSE ALL THE BUILDINGS SO WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY IF NOT 100% THOUGH OR NOT PUBLICLY FUNDED UP BY CALIFORNIANS. A THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- WE WILL HAVE THE DORMITORIES AT RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE WILL HAVE TO RATES ONE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND ONE FOUR- NON LOW INCOME STUDENTS. ONLY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STUDENTS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS SUBSIDY RATE UP WE WILL SELECT THEM BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL AID PAPERWORK THAT THEY HAVE SUBMITTED SO THE STUDENT DOES HAVE TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID- AND THEN IF THAT STUDENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FINANCIAL NEED. THERE WILL BE TOLD THERE IS- THE AVAILABILITY OF ON CAMPUS HOUSING AT A MUCH LOWER RATE FOR THAT STUDENT- SO THAT THAT'S HOW WE ARE CURRENTLY PLANNING ON RUNNING THE PROGRAM DO YOU HAVE- DEFINITION KNOW WHO ARE THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS- WE HAVE NOT. DETERMINED ADAM. POLICY YET IN TERMS OF THE APPLICATION THAT THESE DORMITORIES BUT WE DO HAVE- MANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUSES WHO- HAVE LOW INCOME TO THE POINT WHERE THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A ZERO EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THEIR EDUCATION. MEANING THAT THEY HAVE EXTREMELY LIMITED FUNDS SO WE WOULD LOOK TO TOP POOL OF STUDENTS FIRST. OKAY I AND THEN THE QUESTION IS THAT THE- I DO KNOW THAT THOSE INCOME CATEGORIES CHILDREN SO. TO MY IMPRESSION THEY HAVE A ABUNDANCE OF FINANCIAL AID TO PROGRAM SELECT A CAL GRANT- AND UP POPS OUT- GOVERNMENT THERE'S SOME STAR- AS A SUBSIDY AND THEN ALSO YOU HAVE OF. IS DIFFERENT KINDS- BOOK IN TONER UNIVERSITY- SCHOLARSHIP SO- I'M PLAY ENOUGH TO PAY THEIR REGULAR. IN OTHER CELL AFFORDING THEIR OWN HOUSING OFFER SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AID AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE STUDENT THEN HAS WHAT'S CALLED- THE SELF HELP LEVEL WHICH IS CURRENTLY SET IN STATUTE AT JUST UNDER EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS LIKE. SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SOMETHING- IT'S SET IN STATUTE AND THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO STUDENT HAS TO COME UP WITH I THROUGH THEIR OWN WORK OR LOANS- SO WHILE WE DO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AID FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS THEY STILL DO HAVE NEED OF WE WOULD NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IN THE AID TWENTY STUDENT WE CAN'T WE CAN'T DO THAT BY FEDERAL LAW. SO IF THE STUDENT LOOKS LIKE THEY NO LONGER HAVE FINANCIAL NEED- AND THEY'RE THEY'RE GETTING TOO MUCH INSTITUTIONAL AID WE WOULD THEN TAKE SOME OF THAT INSTITUTIONAL AID AND GIVE IT TO A LESS NEEDY STUDENT NOW WHO WHO DID NOT HAVE A ZERO EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION SO WE'LL USE OUR FINANCIAL AID PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHO ARE D. STUDENTS WHO HAVE. MADE OKAY AMONG THOSE SO- AT THE KERN. TIME UC SYSTEM- HOW MANY ARE- DETERRENT DETERMINE TO BE LOW INCOME- OVERALL THE SELF FIRST A NUMBER ALL ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NEED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT NUMBER DID I HEAR SIX HUNDRED SOMETHING- SANDERS SAYS SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE. ARE AT THIS TIME OF FOR THOSE SO WHO ARE. IN NEED OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND NOT WITHOUT. THE HELP OF THE- YOU SEE THIS IS. UNIVERSITY IS- HELPFUL AND- THEY ARE STRUGGLING. SO SYSTEM WIDE WE KNOW THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE CONSIDERED LOW INCOME AT THE MOMENT ABOUT- 40% OF OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE PELL GRANTS ARE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STUDENTS RECEIVE PELL GRANTS WHICH IS USUALLY A METRIC USED FOR SOMEONE WHO'S A VERY LOW INCOME STATUS- ON OUR CAMPUSES- ANYWHERE BETWEEN. A ONE THIRD TO HALF OF STUDENTS WILL HAVE A GREAT FINANCIAL NEED- THE TWO PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED TO RISK FUNDING WOULD PROVIDE A COMBINED- ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY BEDS SO IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MEET THE NEED FOR. LOW INCOME HOUSING ON THOSE CAMPUSES BUT IT IS A GOOD START. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOSE MEDINA THE CHAIR OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE IN THE RECOGNITION THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE RECEIVED NO CONSTRUCTION GRANTS. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I HOPE THAT- WILL BE REVISITED AND WILL BE CORRECTED OKAY COLLEGE PLANNING GRANTS I THINK IS A GOOD THING BUT WE WANT TO GO BEYOND THE PLANNING AND WE WANT TO ACTUALLY GET THE CONSTRUCTION DONE. A SECOND THING IS THAT THE CONVERSATION REGARDING THE P. THREE- AGREEMENTS AND CONTRACTS- ARE USING THAT AS A TOOL I THINK ABSOLUTELY THE SAFEGUARDS- NEED TO BE THERE- FINALLY IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. MONEY COMING IN FROM THE STATE. WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO PERHAPS ITS POLICY PERHAPS REGULATIONS WHATEVER IT IS NEEDS TO BE DONE TO SAFEGUARD THE STATE'S INVESTMENT AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE OWNERSHIP. AND WITH THE OPERATION OF THE STUDENT HOUSING. THE WE RECKON THAT TO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT P. THREES WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY USINGTHEIR PERSONAL FUNDS OR THE CORPORATE FUNDS TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE WITH FOR THAT FOR THESE FOR THE HOUSING. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THE OWNERSHIP THEY HAVE A RIGHT OF RETURN THEY DON'T HAVE THE OWNERSHIP AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING. SHOULD BE DONE SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT THAT THOSE WHO ARE PRIVATE INDUSTRY WHO DO INVEST TO HELP IN THIS THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT IT IS AN INVESTMENT WITH THE RIGHT OF RETURN AS OPPOSED TO AN INVESTMENT. WITH A OF THE THOUGHT THAT OF OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY. AT THE OTHER THING HAS TO DO SPECIFICALLY WITH THE RENT AFFORDABILITY THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE STUDENT HOUSING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE HOUSING. AND IF WE BILL THE HOUSING BUT IN THE END OUR STUDENTS CAN'T AFFORD IT IT IS NOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR STUDENTS AND THAT IS IN THE END THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OUR STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEED- AND TO THOSE OF THE STUDENTS THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE- PROVIDE HOUSING FOR- IT THE- EARLIER TESTIMONY BEFORE I STEPPED OUT. WE HEARD FROM THE STUDENTS WHO ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THIS STUDENTS WHO APPEARED TO BE HOMELESS FOR PERIODS OF TIME LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND- HAVING TO SHARE. HOUSING WITH FIFTEEN OTHER STUDENTS IN A HOUSE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FOR SIX STUDENTS. THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT THIS THREE BILLION DOLLARS WAS. OUR CHAIR WORKED VERY HARD- IN IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ENDED UP WITH SUCH A- SUCH AN INVESTMENT FOR STUDENT HOUSING AND YES IT IS OVER SUBSCRIBED WITH FOR BILLION BEING- APPLIED FOR. NONETHELESS IT IS FOR STUDENTS IT ISN'T FOR PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO MAKE. WE WANT THEM TO MAKE A GOOD RATE OF RETURN BUT WE DON'T WANT ANY OWNERSHIP GOING OUTSIDE OF THE STATE IF IT IS THE STATE'S INVESTMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF OUR STUDENTS. IF I MAY MAKE A YES GO AHEAD- MASHONALAND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT IN IN THE STATUTE IT DOES- SPECIFICALLY INDICATE THAT- YOU ELIGIBLE TO USE A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE PROGRAM. YEAH JUST WANT TO KEEP. YOU CAN YOU ADDRESS THIS YOU SEE RIVERSIDE. ISSUE WELL FIRST ALL. YOU'RE CORRECT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT WIN INCLUDING MY OWN UNIVERSE HERE AT SAC STATE. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS WAS AROUND ONE WE HAVE THREE ROUNDS OF THIS TWO BILLION AND AS YOU KNOW WE'RE PROPOSING ANOTHER FIVE BILLION THROUGH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SO. HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE MANY- PROJECTS AND GET FUNDED IT'S NOT JUST WINNERS THE WINTERS ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE GETTING SQUEEZED OUT NOT JUST CURRENCY BUT AS WE LOOK TO. DRUM EXPAND COLLEGE ENROLLMENTS WE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING LOOKAS HAPPENING AT UC BERKELEY SO WE NEED THIS CRYSTAL CLEAR. BUT SO THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE OF YOU SEE RIVERSIDE APPARENTLY THEY HAD A REQUEST FOR FIFTY MILLION. AND THEY- DIDN'T MEET THE- RENT. COMPUTATION RELATED TO THEIR STATUTORY REQUIREMENT WHAT IS THE NAME AND ALL THAT MEANS YEAH SO- IN STATURE. THE RENT TO BE INCOME AND THEY PROPOSED A RENT THAT WAS ABOVE THAT REQUIREMENT BOSTON. YEAH SO THAT WAS THE POLICY THAT WE SET FORTH IN THE RULES FOR THE TWO BILLION FROM LAST YEAR YES OKAY SO I GUESS A FEW THINGS ONE. THEY CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT PROJECT WE COULD POTENTIALLY REEVALUATE THAT THIRTY PERCENT- AND THEN ALSO THE SECOND POT OF MONEY MAY NOT HAVE THOSE EXACT. STRINGS IN AND RESTRICTIONS ON THERE YEAH AND WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE RENT WOULD MEET THEIR NEED FOR- TO MAINTAIN THE FACILITY BECAUSE THAT WAS ALSO A METRICS WE WOULD THAT WE EVALUATED AS WELL. YEAH BUT ALSO IT'S PROBABLY APPLES TO ORANGES BECAUSE 30% OF WHAT IT IS AND UCLA AND BERKELEY IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN 30% IN ALREADY RIVERSIDE CELL. RIGHT I WOULD NOTE FOR THAT FOR THE RENT COMPETITION IN PARTICULAR IT'S BASED BY COUNTY YES- YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE WAY IN WHICH THE- RENTAL RATES WERE REGIONALLY ADJUSTED SO THE RENTAL RATE RENTAL COMPUTATION FOR. UC RIVERSIDE WAS BASED ON THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND MY VERSES UCLA USING THE LOS ANGELES- COUNTY. MI OKAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE. YES SIR I COULD QUITE HEAR FROM THE SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT USE SO OF COURSE I AGREE ABOUT THE 30% OF HALF OF AMI'S SO THEY CAN BE AFFORDABLE BASED ON THE REGION BECAUSE SOMETHING ABOUT. FACTORING IN THE PRICE OF THE COST OF MAINTENANCE OR SOMETHING THAT WILL WHAT DID YOU SAY THAT. SO I JUST SAID THAT- A PART OF THE EVALUATION AS WELL WAS JUST TO ENSURE THAT THE RAIN COULD. MEET THEIR THEIR NEED TO MAINTAIN THE FACILITY- BECAUSE IF THE RENT IS BELOW THAT THAT NEED- YOU KNOW WE WOULD JUST. HOPE THAT THEY WOULD EXPLAIN HOW THEY WOULD MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. AND TO AND THE CASE FOR UC RIVERSIDE THEY WERE NOT UNABLE TO DO THAT- NOW FOR THE CASE OF ROUTE UC RIVERSIDE THEY JUST- THEIR PROPOSED RENT THAT THEY PROVIDED IN THEIR APPLICATION WAS ABOVE THE REQUIRED AMOUNT. WITHIN STATUTE. RIGHT SO I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AND I A LIME A COMP EVERYONE ELSE SAID EVERY GREAT POINT THAT I COULD'VE MADE ALREADY BUT IT IS IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY FOR THIS POPULATION OF SPECIAL STUDENTS SPECIAL CONCERNS. ALSO AS SOON IS PAYING TO WORK RIGHT BEING A STUDENT FULL TIME IS A JOB IN AND OF ITSELF AND MAYBE THEY HAVE PART TIME WORK TO SUPPLEMENT THAT. BUT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON AFFORDABILITY AND- A HIGHER SOME. IS BETTER- THERE IS OF COURSE THIS POINT YOU RUN INTO OF COURSE IF WE'RE BUILDING. AS SUBSIDIZES POSSIBLE CAN THE PROJECT CAN THE DEVELOPMENT ITSELF BE SUSTAINED RIGHT AND THAT'S A PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THE LARGER CONTEXT. OF GOVERNMENT. SPONSORED HOUSING THAT'S THE LARGER PROBLEM WE HAVE IS LIKE CAN IT BE SELF SUSTAINING. AND THAT'S SOMETHING I HOPE THERE'S SOME FACTOR NEW ONCE BECAUSE- OF WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR THE P. RIGHT FOR IT YOU KNOW WHAT FIFTY. HALF OF START 30% OF HALF OF AM I. IN RIVERS I COUNTY. IS GREAT FOR THE FOR THE PERSON BUT- THE FIXED COSTS OF MAINTAINING A PLACE MAY NOT BE QUITE. THE ROUNDED UP THAT WAY. BECAUSE WITH THAT HAVE. 30% OF HALF A MIND TO BE AREA WHERE I REPRESENT OBVIOUSLY IS MUCH GREATER AMOUNT AND CANS SOMETIMES SUPPLEMENT THE CALL- HIGH FIXED COSTS NOT ALWAYS. THIS CAN DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION- SO I THINK IT'S ABOARD THE FACT. THINGS AND- YOU KNOW I THINK I KNOW THAT SHARE KIND OF BROUGHT UP SOME POINT ABOUT. HOW YOU SPREAD THE WEALTH AMONG THE CHILDREN. AND I HOPE THAT WITH OUR ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF MONEY IN THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN. INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY THAT WE CAN GET. TO- AS COMPLETE SPEND FOR YOU ALL SPOTS BECAUSE I KNOW WITH YOU THIS IS A J. HOUSING. RIGHT IF THERE'S SO MUCH AND TRYING TO BUY. MONEY FOR PROJECTS IT BAKES THEM LESS. CERTAIN TO BE BUILT THAT LOTS OF THE RESULTS IN DELAYS RIGHTS PROJECT UP. MIGHT NOT EVEN PENCILING OUT OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT HAPPEN SO I. AM MUCH ON THAT SIDE OF DELIVERING THAT SENSE AND I IT RECOGNIZE ALSO COMMENTS ABOUT NEEDING AN EXTERNAL PARTNER. AND THAT'S ALSO PARTLY WHY YOU KNOW IN IN MY HOUSE ARE PROPOSING A BILL ABOUT HAVING A STATE SPONSORED ENTERPRISE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. AND FRANKLY IT'S ALSO INFORMED BY THE- MODEL THAT YOU ARE PAYING HEARING YOU KNOW FIRST OF FOREMOST YOU'RE ALL INSTITUTIONS OF. HIGHER EDUCATION LEARNING AND NOW YOU'RE GETTING INTO THE BUSINESS OF RECALL STATE. WHICH IS. VERY INTERESTING BUT IT IS KIND OF A LEARNING LESSON FOR US IN THE STATE THAT. PERHAPS THERE IS A STRONGER C. INTERVENTION IN THIS AND IT'S ABOUT HOW DO WE LEVERAGE RESOURCES DO SO. SO I HOPE THAT THEY'LL BE SOME NEW ONES AND I'M SO I COULDN'T HEAR EVERY. COMMENT YOU'D SAID FROM OUTSIDE THE ROOM. BUT SIDE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD MAINTAIN AFFORDABILITY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE- AND ALSO HOPEFULLY WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IN OUR BUDGET SO HOPEFULLY A LOT MORE MONEY WILL COME AND HOPEFULLY YOU GET BILL DEVELOPER PROJECTS FASTER. ABBY'S RIGHT NOW- EVEN THOUGH THERE'S ONE VERY PROJECT ON THE LIST RIGHT NOW. I REPRESENTS THE OTHER BAY AREA. SECTION THAT IS ONE OF THE FIVE MOST EXPENSIVE METROPOLIS AIRS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE MORE IN THE BAY AREA- BUT THAT I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR ITS AND BUILDING PERSON HOUSING TO. THANK OKAY THANK- DOCTOR CHOI. FINAL QUESTION IF. WE MOVE ON. YEAH LET ME- JUST A RAY HAS- COMES TO MY MIND- THIS PANDEMIC THAT THAT THE WE ARE EXPERIENCING HAS A CERTAIN NEEDS CHANGE- THE WORKER FOR ILLNESS BY PRIVATE COMPANY EMPLOYEES I NOTICED THAT- MANY EMPLOYEES- NOW PICK AND CHOOSE- THE EMPLOYMENT. BASED UPON THE EMPLOYER SO REQUIREMENTS HOW MANY TIMES SHOULD. A PEER TO THE OFFICE TO WORK AND THE THEIR PREFERENCE IS SET TO WORK LAST SELLECCA ONCE A WEEK- AT THE- WORKPLACE- AND OF USING THAT- NEW TREND I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY OUR PARADIGM IF YOU WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE IS A SHIFTING AND THEN ALSO DOING DEPEND THAT MAKE UP WE HAVE EXPERIENCED. CAMPUS WAS SHUT DOWN BUT THE LEARNING CONTINUED. THROUGH TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS ASSUME I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES THE MATH THOSE SO YOU HAVE DEVELOPED TO TEACH A- AND SEVEN. WITH HIS EXPERIENCE- I WONDER IF WE CAN EXPLORE IT EXPLORE FURTHER- AND IMPROVE FOR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN- DEFICIENT. THROUGH OFFLINE OWNING NO I'M I'M SORRY ONLINE LEARNING RIGHT OVER THE INTERNET THOUGH- HOW WE CAN IMPROVE UPON THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THE WE HAVE RETURNED. OVER THIS UP AND THEN MAKE UP AND ENCOURAGE AND OFFER MORE COURSES THROUGH ONLINE RATHER THAN PHYSICAL HOUSING. AND WHICH WILL COST SO OBVIOUSLY- UP TO MENDOZA MONO- YOU KNOW TAXPAYERS MONEY WANT UNIVERSITY A PRIVATE THE WHOEVER GETS INVOLVED IN THE PEACE THREE USE ETCETERA. SO- I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THE- EVEN BEFORE THIS MEETING FUTURE UNIVERSITIES- THE FISCAL NEEDS IS SEVERAL FAR. I SHOULD BE RETHOUGHT AND THE CHANGE THAT BECAUSE ARE THEIR AWESOME SO CALLED A PRIVATE COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES. 100% OUR ONLINE NO CAMPERS MY EVEN NOT- TOTALING ALL. LAST DECEMBER SHE GOT HER. DOCTOR DEGREE IN EVEN NURSE PRACTICE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA. AND UPON GRADUATION I GOT TO IT. TO PARTICIPATE THE ON CAMPUS GRADUATION IN A GRADUATION THEY CAN COME BUT DOES SHE HAVE TO APPEAR AT THREE FOUR TIMES A YEAR ON CAMPERS. OVER THE WEEKEND SO BUT THEY IT BUT THEY- CHI- THE TEACHING SO THERE MAY BE CERTAIN COURSES- THAT- MAY BE SUITABLE WAS ARE IN ON NOT NOT SO FOR ALL ONLINE LEARNING. WHY DON'T WE THINK GOD THAT FRAME OF THINKING. RATHER THAN THINKING PREPAYMENT THAT MAKE AND THE TRADITIONAL HOUSING PROJECTS ON HOUSING EVERYBODY HAS TO BE ON CAMPUS I WANT TO WORK THE BEST PERSON. ONE MAY HAVE SOME WITH WHEN THAT. MAYBE TO JUMP IN FOR ON THE SO I THINK YOU. A KEY POINT ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION THAT WE'VE SEEN ACROSS HIGHER EDUCATION SO HIGHER EDUCATION MOVING FORWARD IN THAT- ENDEMIC AREA WILL NOT LOOK THE WAY THAT- MY FAVORITE PHRASE THAT I'VE HEARD NOW IS IN THE BEFORE TIMES. SO IT'S NOT GONNA LOOK THE WAY IT DID IN THE BEFORE TIMES- AND INCLUDING OUR HOUSING WILL NEED AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT- INCLUSIONS OF TECHNOLOGY BASED LEARNING STUDENT SUPPORTS- ALL OF THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERATION WHAT. OUR SYSTEM IS SPEAKING FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVICE OVER 40% POSTER NATIONAL STUDENTS THESE ARE STUDENTS THAT ARE OVER TWENTY FIVE DON'T REALLY LIVE THIS NOTION THAT THEY COULD LIVE AT HOME WITH MOM AND DAD. THAT FAMILY STRUCTURE MAY NOT EXIST FOR THEM AND SO FOR THESE STUDENTS HAVING HOUSING OPTIONS IS A OF A PATH INTO SOCIAL ECONOMIC MOBILITY- AND IT IS A PATH OF A SECURITY AND THAT FUNDAMENTAL- SERVICES THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACADEMICS AND EVENTUALLY IN A CAREER SO. WE'RE REALLY TARGETING A VERY DIVERSE POPULATION THAT- MAY NOT HAVE THAT FAMILY STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES A HOME AND SO THAT'S REALLY- THEY LEGISLATURES VALUE ON INVESTING IN PROJECTS THAT HAVE A COMMITMENT TOWARDS AFFORDABILITY REALLY ALIGNS WITH THAT- ELEMENT. DID YOU WANT S. SOMEBODY ELSE YOUR QUESTION DOCTOR CHOI. YOU KNOW IF ANYBODY OUTSIDE. THE HOUSE OF THE FREE ACTION. I THANK HIM FOR CHOI I THINK OF MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE COLLEAGUES CORRECT WE WON'T EXACTLY SWING BACK TO PRE PANDEMIC AND CAMPUSES WILL CONTINUE TO. CREATE A SPACES- SPECIALLY LABORATORIES TYPE SPACES. GIVEN YOUR YOUR DAUGHTER IN LAWS- LEARNING IN NURSING OFF A DISTANCE DISTANCE LEARNING BUT- WE WILL STILL HAVE THE NEED FOR IN IN PERSON LAB COURSES AND UNIVERSITY ART CSU STILL FINDS IT ON CAMPUS HOUSING BENEFITS. STUDENTS CRIED. RATE AND RETURN WHERE IT WAS BUT THEY'RE STILL. SHARE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT AND RESEARCH THAT HAVE BEEN BEEN DONE TO SUPPORT ON CAMPUS- LIVING COMMUNITIES. HEY HOUSES JUST OF. MY AND MY PREDICTION. MY POSITION IN THE FUTURE WHAT BEHAVIOR AND THAT LEARNING BEHAVIOR WE NEED TO REPHRASE OUR THINKING AND- INSTEAD WILL- KEEPING THE OLD TRADITION OF WAR STALLION- FISCAL CAMPERS- HAS TO BE THERE AND- YOU ANSWER- I MEAN I FEEL LIKE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THE OF SOCIAL PROBLEM OTHER THAN NOT STUDENTS SO PROBLEM WHO NEED TO BE- AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION AND HIGHER EDUCATION WITH WE THINK ABOUT THE FISCAL. OF CAMPUS- AND THAT THEY NEED TO BE HOUSE STILL AND- BECAUSE OF THEIR INCOME LEVEL THEY THAT THEY DO NEED TO HOUSING BUT THE WE WHAT ABOUT THE IF I THAT IS THE THOUGHT TRAINS AND WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT BOUND TO COLLEGE AND- NOT ADMITTED TO COLLEGE HOW DO THEY SOLVE THE HOUSING PROBLEM SO SAME SAME ISSUE THAT THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH A SORE- YOU KNOW I'M NOT. NOT LOOKING FOR- IMMEDIATE ANSWER BUT THE- A IS A FOOT THOUGHT UP FOR THE COLLEGE ADMINISTRATION AND I THINK THE STATE THAT WE AND WE NEED TO- THINK ABOUT THE REFOCUSING HOW WE CAN- SAVE OUR RESOURCES. AND THE ASEAN E. AT THE EFFECTIVE WHAT WAY OF A CONTINUING ONE HIGH HIGH EDUCATION. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT TO- TO CHEW ON HERE SO WE WILL. NOT TAKE ACTION HERE HOLD OPEN- LOOK AT THE NEXT ROUND BUT ALSO EXPLORE WHAT TO DO. WITH STATE MONEY RELATED COLLEGE HOUSING BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY IT'S A IT'S AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY IN TOPIC WE SPENT TWO HOURS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AS THE INTEREST OF. OF THAT THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SO EXPECT A MORE ACTION ON THIS. THANK YOU NEXT ISSUES REALLY ARE- VARIOUS HIGHER EDUCATION PROPOSALS. IN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. SO OUR SYSTEM DOES NOT. ARE YOU YOUR COMMENT. WE ARE BUT THE PUBLIC. REPUBLICAN MAINE WE'LL GET THE VERY END. YES IT MAY BE AWHILE. THE THIS. ONE OF THOSE GAMES. NUMBER. OKAY PLEASE PROCEED YOU SHOULD TO WE'LL HAVE TO FINANCE L. A. O. AND CALIFORNIA EDUCATION LEARNING LAB. HI GOOD MORNING SURE MEMBERS SAID JACK'S WALTZ BERMAN FINANCE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS- THREE PROPOSALS IN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH IS BUDGET WITH YOU TODAY- THESE PROPOSALS ARE THREE MILLION- JOE FUND FOR THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION LEARNING LAB ALSO KNOWN AS SELL. TWENTY MILLION- GENERAL FUND FOR A CLIMATE RESEARCH UP AND THREE MILLION- GENERAL FUND FOR THE GOLD SAID WORDS PROGRAM- OUR FIRST PROPOSAL- THREE MILLION FOR CELL CONSISTS OF TWO MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO RESTORE REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR GRANTS MADE AT THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. AND A MILLION DOLLARS TO ESTABLISH- AND OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES PLATFORM. OUR SECOND PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE AT TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO CURRY SCIENCE FOR CLIMATE RESEARCH- FACILITY IN PASADENA THIS ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO FACING CLIMATE CHANGE HEAD ON AND THIS INVESTMENT WILL SPUR RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND GREATER STANDARD OF SOLUTION STILL AND IMPACTS OF OUR CHANGING CLIMATE IS THE PER OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. TO ESTABLISH THE GOLDEN STATE AWARDS GRANT PROGRAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCENTIVIZING CELEBRATING AND ELEVATING HIGH IMPACT INNOVATIONS CREATING CALIFORNIA. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SUBCOMMITTEE THIS MORNING AND I AM READY ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. OKAY L. A. F. JASON CALLED. SOLELY IF IT'S HELPFUL YOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG ON PAGE FOURTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA THAT LISTS THE EACH OF THE THREE PROPOSALS AN ISSUE TOO. I'LL GO THROUGH EACH EACH ISSUE ONE AT A TIME. THE FIRST ISSUE IT IS THE THREE MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL FOR CELL. TWO OF TWO MILLION OF THAT RESTORE CELLS BUDGET TO ITS PRE PANDEMIC LEVEL AND THEN A MILLION DOLLARS WOULD HELP SCALE. OCCURRENCE ADAPTIVE LEARNING TOOL THAT SELLS CURRENTLY OVERSEEING. WE HAVE LONG STANDING CONCERNS WITH THIS- PROGRAM OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THAT- THE ACTIVITIES THAT SO UNDERTAKES SUPPORTING. EDUCATIONAL INNOVATIONS A NEW ONLINE TOOLS AND CONTENT OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT INTERVIEWS ARE ACTIVITIES THAT. A CAMPUS IS ALREADY RECEIVE BASED ON GOING SUPPORT TO UNDERTAKE. IN ADDITION SINCE THE PANDEMIC CAMPUSES HAVE- NOTABLY INCREASED OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH THESE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE SPENDING A PORTION OF THEIR A FEDERALLY FUNDING ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. IN LIGHT OF THAT THE PROPOSAL TO OUR STORE SELL TO THAT'S PREPAID DEBIT LEVEL. IS UNCLEAR TO US. FOR THAT REASON WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL. MOVING ALONG TO THE SECOND PROPOSAL THAT'S THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE GOLDEN STATE AWARDS. THIS IS EFFECTIVELY ANOTHER ROUND OF INNOVATION AWARDS OF GOVERNORS AND PASTORS HAVE PROPOSED HIGHER EDUCATION INNOVATION AWARDS THEY- TYPICALLY SUPPORT. CAMPUSES ARE FACULTY IN UNDERTAKING WATER CONSIDERED INNOVATIVE PRACTICES SKEPTICAL THESE INNOVATION AWARDS FOR NUMBER OF REASONS ONE BEING THAT- THESE ARE AGAIN THE SORTS OF ACTIVITIES THAT CAMPUSES ARE EXPECTED TO UNDERTAKE AS PART OF THEIR ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. AND ALSO BECAUSE IN PAST YEARS THERE'S BEEN SORT OF A SMALL NUMBER OF AWARD RECIPIENTS. AND THEN VERY LITTLE CLEAR PATHWAY IN TERMS OF HOW TO SCALE INSEMINATE OTHERS BEST PRACTICES MOVING FORWARD. IN ADDITION TO THOSE ARE. ONGOING CONCERNS WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IN THAT IT HAS A MUCH BROADER SCOPE THAN PREVIOUS INNOVATION AWARDS- WORSE PREVIOUS INNOVATION WHERE TO FOCUS PRIMARILY ON STUDENT OUTCOMES. THIS WOULD ALSO FOCUS ON CLIMATE ISSUES AND- ANY OTHER ISSUE THAT IS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED SORT OF INNOVATIVE AND IMPACTFUL. GIVEN ITS BROAD SCOPE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE INITIATIVE WOULD FULLY ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES THAT AIMS TO ADDRESS AND FOR THAT REASON- WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL. I'M MOVING ON TO THE THIRD PROPOSAL THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CARNEGIE SCIENCE- ON. CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE. OTHERS WOULD SUPPORT OF PART OF THE COST TO CONSTRUCT A NEW FACILITY FOR THE INSTITUTE WHICH IS A- PRIVATE NONPROFIT ENTITY. BECAUSE OF THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT ENTITY THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE LITTLE GUARANTEE THAT THE- OUR ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THE INSTITUTE WILL ALIGN WITH STATE OBJECTIVES. AND THEN MORE OVER THE LEGISLATURE AS WE NOTED IN ISSUE ONE HAS MANY OTHER ACADEMICS. AS MANY OTHER CAPITAL OUTLAY ISSUES INCLUDING THE ACADEMIC FACILITY ISSUES WE MENTIONED IN ISSUE ONE. FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE WAY THIS PROPOSAL AGAINST ITS OTHER COMPETING PRIORITIES. THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE LEGISLATURE STILL USE THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSALS HIGH PRIORITY. WE RECOMMENDED MODIFYING THE PROPOSAL TO INCLUDE SOME ADDITIONAL INTENT AND REPORTING LANGUAGE. FOR THE SECOND TIME I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL ON EACH EACH RECOMMENDATION BUT THE OVERALL INTENT IS TO CLARIFY THE STATE'S ROLE IN SUPPORTING THIS PROJECT. AND TO GET SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT ONCE IT'S COMPLETED. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT BAKER HI MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LARK PARK DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION LEARNING LAB THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY- THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION LEARNING LAB WAS AUTHORIZED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT AS A PROGRAM DEDICATED TO IMPROVING LEARNING OUTCOMES AND CLOSING EQUITY GAPS ACROSS THE UCCS USING COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE LEARNING LAB IS EXACTLY THAT IT'S ALLOWED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO IMPROVE. TEACHING AND LEARNING AND THEN SCALE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND PROMISING PRACTICES- TO FOSTER GREATER STUDENT SUCCESS WE ACHIEVE THIS BY INCENTIVIZING FACULTY INNOVATION- THAT IT IS UNDER A COMPETITIVE GRANT MODEL WITH EXPERTS AS SELECT THE MOST PROMISING PRO FOR AWHILE R. A. EXPERT US LAW AND OF INCLUDE A NOBEL LAUREATE IN PHYSICS AND INNOVATOR AT AMAZON- EXPERT INSIDE AT. AND EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL AS FACULTY LEADERS WHO ARE WELL KNOWN FOR ADVANCING DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION- ACROSS A PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION WE HAVE BROAD REACH DEAD SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN WE FUNDED THIRTY NINE PROJECTS THAT INVOLVE ALL NINE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES OF THE UC TWENTY OUT OF THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES A CSU IN FORTY THREE OF THE HUNDRED SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE PROJECTS ALSO USE THAT MAKE USE OF A STATE WIDE SYSTEM WIDE- NETWORKS. WE NEED NOTED OUR BUDGET REQUEST OF TWO MILLION TO RESTORE GRANTMAKING CAPACITY TO PRETEND THAT MAKE LEVELS AND A MILLION TO EXPAND AND- WE ARE PLATFORM TO DELIVER FREE AND LOW COST STEM HOMEWORK SYSTEMS TO STUDENTS AND WE BELIEVE THESE WILL BE BOTH BOTH WORTHWHILE AFTER THE STATE TO INVEST IN OUR FUNDED PROJECTS OFFER MUCH MORE THAN THE AVERAGE REDESIGNED COURSE IN ADDITION TO BEING EQUITY FOCUSED AND TECHNOLOGICALLY SOPHISTICATED THEY OFFER US STUDENTS A CHANCE TO LEARN MORE DEEPLY AND THEY'RE BASED ON INTER SEGMENTAL COLLABORATION TO MAXIMIZE IMPACT ACROSS ALL THREE SEGMENTS- AND THEY ALSO CLOSE THE MEASURE EFFECTS ON STUDENTS AND FACULTY- AS AN EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR FUNDED PRO. FOCUSED ON CHEMISTRY WORK TO REALLY REDEFINE WHAT IT MEANS TO DO SCIENCE AND IN THE CLASSROOM AT LOWER DIVISION LEVELS- AND THEY'RE SEEING GAINS OF MORE THAN 18% IN STUDENT SUCCESS. AND I ALMOST SEVENTEEN PERCENT- AND IMPROVEMENTS IN RETENTION- AND LIKE WHY IS IT A BIT IN A BEER PROJEC FOCUSED ON BIG IDEAS IN MATHEMATICS- THERE'S SEEING GREATER COMPLETION RATES OF UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS- BY FOURTEEN PLUS PERCENTAGE POINTS SO. ARE PROJECTS ARE ACTUALLY HAVING A REALLY POSITIVE IMPACT ALTHOUGH ONLINE AND HYBRID ENVIRONMENTS OR NATIVE ENVIRONMENTS FOR MANY OF OUR PROJECTS AND WE DEFINE HYBRID VERY BROADLY- THE MATERIALS THAT THEY'VE DEVELOPED THEIR ALL OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES THEY'RE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO BE. ADAPTED AND APPLICABLE TO ALL THESE COURSE SETTINGS AND SO WE BELIEVE INVESTING IN THIS PROGRAM IS A BASIC R&amp;D PROGRAM HELPS INCREASE THE STATE'S INVESTMENT INTO HIGHER EDUCATION WHICH IS- WHICH IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY- AND THIS DEDICATED FUNDING HAS MEANT A GREAT DEAL TO FACULTY IN THAT IT SENDS A REALLY STRONG MESSAGE TO THEM. THE STATE REALLY CARES ABOUT INNOVATION IN TEACHING AND LEARNING FOR STUDENT SUCCESS- I'M SEPARATE ITEM OF THE GOLDEN STATE AWARDS WELL I WOULD JUST LIKE TO NOTE. REGARDING ALEJO'S CONCERNS AT THE EXACT PARAMETERS OF THE GOLDEN STATE AWARDS- THEY DO REMAIN UNSTATED BUT ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH IS REALLY. TO ALLOW- A LOOK ALLOW US TO ASK TODAY'S INNOVATORS- WHAT WOULD THAT THE BEST DESIGN OF THIS AWARD PROGRAM LOOKS LIKE WE COULD WE HAVE SO MANY US. AN INCREDIBLE INNOVATORS AT THE STATE I CALIFORNIA'S LIKE JENNIFER DOUDNA AND ANDREA GAZ WERE BOTH IN A RECENT NOBEL LAUREATES THEY CAN ACTUALLY. PROVIDE INPUT- ON HOW CALIFORNIA COULD MAKE THE MOST OF THIS FUNDING AND INNOVATORS DO NOT REST ON THEIR LAURELS- INNOVATION DOESN'T REALLY HAPPEN OKAY. TO A FIVE POINT YOU KNOW PRE. PLAN AND SO THE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE THIS. MAKE THIS AWARDS PROGRAM AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE- TO BOTH CELEBRATE AND PROMOTE INNOVATION- THERE'S OPPORTUNITY HERE IN TERMS OF GIVING SPACE. TODAY'S INNOVATORS TO HELP US DESIGNED THIS PROGRAM- I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU. I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU OF THESE ITEMS WE WILL ALL THE ISSUES OPEN. WALDRON MATHIS STOOD ON- JUST TO HAVE- I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION ON THE CELL- THE DISEASE IS ALSO BEING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS ALSO DEVELOPING CLASSES. THAT OCCURRED IS THE IS THE- ONLINE HIGHER EDUCATION COURSES COMMITTEE CALLED ALSO I SEE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES ARE ALSO PARTICIPATING THE CELL EFFORT YES VERY MUCH SO FORTY THREE AT A HUNDRED SIXTEEN- CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE REPRESENTED OUR THIRTY NINE PROJECTS THAT WE'VE AWARDED TODAY YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION I JUST WONDER WHY THEY'RE PARTICIPATING IN THIS AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE CALIBRATE. BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM IS NOT. EXCLUSIVELY DEDICATED TO ONLINE COURSES AND IT'S NOT DEDICATED TO- TARGETING A DIFFERENT POPULATION IT TARGETS THE EXISTING POPULATION AND IT HAS A FACULTY WORKING ACROSS THE THREE SEGMENTS. ON PROJECTS- PRIMARILY IN STEM AND SO THE MATERIALS IN THE RESOURCES IN THE PROJECTS ARE REALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF COURSES ONLINE HYBRID- WHICH WE'VE ACTUALLY DEFINED QUITE BROADLY. SOME WHAT WHAT MY THESE COURSES LOOK I'M A STUDENT CLASSROOM IS KIND OF A CANDLER COURSE SECOND SHEET THAT I COULD. IT'S ONLINE I ASSUME ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT ONLINE IT IT OR NOT ONLINE AT ALL. NO SOME OF THEM ARE ONLINE AND SOME OF THEM ARE HYBRID COURSES AND SO THE MATERIALS THAT ARE DEVELOPED FOR THESE FOR THESE PROJECTS THEY CAN WORKING AN ONLINE CONTEXT FOR A HYBRID CONTEXT OR AN IN PERSON CONTACT PROJECT LEARNING APPROACH OF YOU. KNOW UP THE BY PROJECT WE MEAN THE PROJECTS THAT WE AWARD- SO FACULTY GET TOGETHER THEY PROPOSE A PROJECT FOR HOW TO- IMPROVE STUDENT LEARNING. LET'S SAY. COURSE OR CALCULUS COURSE BY ALL COURSE- AND SO THEY WILL BRING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES THEY'LL- THEY'LL HAVE A RESEARCH DESIGN ABOUT WHAT THEY MEANT. MEASURE WHAT THEY THINK WILL HAPPEN WITH STUDENT SUCCESS AND THEN THEY REPORT OUT THE RESULTS OFWHAT ACTUALLY CHANGED AND SOME OF THE OUTCOMES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER- I HAVE SEEN IT THERE THERE BEEN SOME QUITE POSITIVE OUTCOMES ON STUDENT SUCCESS AND RETENTION. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU HOLD THIS ISSUE OFTEN. AS YOU NUMBER THREE CAL KIDS IMPLEMENTATION. THE- GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS AND W. LIKE HAVE. BECAUSE IT'S AN INCREASE OF FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR NOTIFICATION AND MARKETING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CALIFORNIA KIDS INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT SAVINGS PROGRAM CAO KIDS THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION I'M GOING GENERAL FUND FOR FINANCIAL LITERACY OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT WILL INFORM FAMILIES OF THE LONG TERM BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COPY ITS PROGRAM IN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND I'M GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT TO ADDITIONAL STAFF WHAT THEY CALL GETS PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY THE MINISTRATION PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND I'M GOING GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT COSTS FOR A NEED TO CREATE A RECORDKEEPING PLATFORM. AND CRITICAL IT NEEDS FOR THE CAUCUS PROGRAM. THANK YOU I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY ALAIA GOOD MORNING CAN MEMBERS BASICALLY WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THIS ISSUE COVERS SEVERAL PROPOSALS RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COCKETTES PROGRAM. WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS REGARDING THAT TO PROPOSED POSITIONS OR THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AUGMENTATION INCLUDED IN THIS FROM FINANCE WATER AND SO INSTEAD FOCUS MY COMMENTS AND THE REMAINING PROPOSALS WHICH RELATE OUTREACH. IF YOU TURN THE PAGE TWENTY ONE OF HERNANDEZ THAT FIGURE AT THE TOP HERE SUMMARIZES THE GOVERNOR'S AT WHICH PROPOSALS AS ALSO DESCRIBED BY MY COLLEAGUE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THERE ARE TWO ISSUES WE WOULD RAISE REGARDING THAT REACH PROPOSALS. THE FIRST IS THAT THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS HAVE SOME OVERLAPPING PURPOSES THAT PARTICIPANT NOTIFICATION AND MARKETING CAMPAIGN ARE INTENDED TO MAKE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AWARE OF THEIR CALL KIDS ACCOUNTS. WELL THE FINANCIAL LITERACY AVERAGE PROPOSALS INTENDED TO INFORM THEM OF THE BENEFITS OF SAVING WITH THOSE ACCOUNTS. HERE WE THINK THERE MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSOLIDATE THESE PROPOSALS INTO ONE SO THAT WE CAN SEND A MORE UNIFIED MESSAGE TO STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND POTENTIALLY ALSO REDUCE DUPLICATION ACROSS INITIATIVES. THIS ISSUE WOULD RAISE REGARDING THAT RICH PROPOSALS IS SPECIFIC TO THE FINANCIAL LITERACY COMPONENT THAT FIVE MILLION ONGOING. READ LIMITED DETAIL ON THE SPECIFIC ONGOING FINANCIAL LITERACY ACTIVITIES THAT THE SCHOLARSHIP INVESTMENT BOARD WOULD UNDERTAKE WITH THESE FUNDS. IN ADDITION THE PROPOSED FUNDING LEVEL THE FIVE MILLION IS NOT DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE COST OF THOSE ACTIVITIES. AND SO REGARDING THE FINANCIAL LITERACY WE WOULD RECOMMEND WITHHOLDING ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL AND REQUESTING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED. PROPOSAL THAT SATISFIES WHAT ACTIVITIES WOULD OCCUR. YES MY ACOSTA IS ACTIVITIES AND MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO COORDINATE THEM WITH THE RELATED PARTISAN NOTIFICATION A MARKETING CAMPAIGN. THANK YOU HAPPY TAKEN QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU THIS SCHOLARS YOUR INVESTMENT BIRTH. HI NEWSSTANDS YOU KNOW FROM THE US CULTURE INVESTMENT BOARD THANK YOU. YEAH THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND- MEMBERS OF THE OF BUDGET SUB SUB COMMITTEE- ON MANY STANDS VETO FROM THE- SASHA INVESTMENT BOARD I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. SURE ALL CALLS WILL START OUT WITH SOME JUST TECHNICAL QUESTION SO THIS HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR MANY YEARS AND WITH OUR- YOU KNOW ONCE IN A GENERATION BUDGET LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO GO. VERY VERY BIG ON THIS. SO- WE HAD THIS ONE TIME INFUSION TO START THIS TO GET PEOPLE IT COUNTS AND THAT ONGOING MONEY TO KEEP SEATING THAT SO WHAT'S THE STATUS ON. LETTING SINCE THE MILLIONS OF FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA NO HAY. HERE YOU GO HERE'S AN ACCOUNT FOR YOU. YEAH YET THE STATUSES WERE WORKING ON A TOWARD A LAUNCH IN JULY AND- WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS- AN ITEM MENTIONED IN HERE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE NOTIFICATIONS ON THAT WOULD GO OUT TO ALL OF THE- A PICTURE WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE SO. YOUR FAMILY YOU HAVE NO IDEAS HAPPEN YOU KNOW FOLLOW STATE GOVERNMENT. YOU KNOW YOU GET MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MAIL IN YOUR- L. BOX EVERY DAY. MOST OF ITS JUNK MAIL AND PEOPLE TRYING TO RIP YOU OFF WITH CREDIT CARDS ARE SUDDENLY. BLOWN THIS AND THAT SO HOW WE'RE GONNA BREAK THROUGH. AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THIS IS REAL AND NOT SOME SCAM. OR VAGUE WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH MINISTRATION AND- THE- AS FAR AS LIKE WORKING TOWARDS LAUNCH WERE- JUST TAKING A PICTURE WHAT'S IS GONNA LOOK LIKE IF YOUR FAMILY A MILE FROM HERE. AND IN YOUR MAILBOX EVERY DAY ARE CREDIT CARD THINGS AND THIS AND THAT IT JUST LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER WHEN THESE THINGS ARE TRYING TO GET ME SO LIKE HOW ARE WE GOING TO BREAK THROUGH AND- TAKING A PICTURE HOW FAMILIES CAN UNDERSTAND THIS IT'S GOING TO BE A COMBINATION OF THE NOTIFICATIONS AS WELL AS JUST. THE MARKETING OUR EACH COMPONENT WE ALSO MENTIONED BEFORE- WORK IN PROGRESS WITH PREPARING THIS NOTIFICATION TO WAS VERY CLEAR AND DIRECT IN TERMS OF- WHAT THE PROGRAM IS- AS FAR AS LIKE WHOSE WHOSE- WHO'S ADMINISTERING IT- AND- WE HAVE A WEBSITE UP THAT SUPPOSED TO BE VERY INFORMATIVE- FOR FOLKS- TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AND TO GET TO THE WEBSITE TO REGISTER WERE ALSO PLANNING TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH ORGANIZATIONS AND SCHOOLS. TO MAKE SURE THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THEM ONCE WE GET ALL THE DATA AND INFORMATION OUT- WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND- AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT ON THE NOTIFICATIONS GO OUT ON TIME AND- ON A REGULAR BASIS IN COMBINATION WITH ALL OF THE OTHER OUT REACH UPI REACH ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING SO FIRST OF ALL DON'T GET ME WRONG I'M I'M A HUGE BELIEVER IN THIS I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS AND- PEOPLE HAVE A COLLEGE ACCOUNTS ARE LIKE EIGHT TIMES MORE LIKELY TO GO ON TO COLLEGE AS YOU KNOW. TO SET EXPECTATIONS MORE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION AND WE NEED MORE PEOPLE TO GO TO COLLEGE FOR OUR ECONOMY. BUT I JUST THINK IT'S GONNA BE. REALLY COMPLICATED BECAUSE SO MANY YOU GET YOUR MAIL. IT'S LIKE HEY YOU WIN CALL THIS NUMBER FOR THIS AND THAT AND LIKE EVERYTHING IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE HE KICKED IN YOUR MAILBOX. ON A DAILY DAILY BASIS I JUST THINK IT'S GOING TO BE. REALLY HARD. TO ENABLE FAMILIES NOW THIS IS LEGIT THIS IS REAL THE UP TO SIGN UP. SO IT THE LANDS THAT WE NEED IT LENDS THE- NOTION THAT WE NEED. MUCH MORE THAN JUST. A LETTER OR MULTIPLE LETTERS. IN THE MAIL SO THE HARDENER SHIPS WOULD SCHOOLS OR I KNOW THAT THERE'S PROPOSALS TAKING A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN WE DID THIS WE DID JUST GREAT THE COUNCIL GAVE MONEY TO THESE. PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIVES IN DIFFERENT CITIES LIKE OAKLAND HAS THAT. COLLEGE PROMISE THING WEST SACRAMENTO HAS A PROGRAM WE HAVE ONE HERE IN THE CITY SACRAMENTO SMALLER ONE SO DO WE UTILIZE THESE TO HELP. SPREAD THE WORD ENGAGE PEOPLE KINDA LIKE WE DO WITH. THE L. CENSUS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH TYPE STUFF BECAUSE I JUST THINK THEY- DID THAT ON THE NATURAL. SENDING LETTERS TO THE L. THREE MILLION FAMILIES IS NOT GONNA WORK. AND IF I MAY JUST SAD I'M CURRENTLY CHAO'S WITH THE PALM NO FINANCE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A ONE BILLION TO GROW- PROVIDE MARKETING SERVICES TO ITS CULTURE INVESTMENT MORE. SURPRISED THAN INCLUDED CABLE TV- ADS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. N. ADDITIONALLY OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A FIVE MILLION I'M GOING FINANCIAL EDUCATION INCENTIVES AS THIS WILL BE TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND LEARN ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF ACCRUED BENEFITS ACCRUE INTEREST. AND I WOULD ALSO BRING- A LOT MORE IN INFORMATION TO THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE THAT SLIGHT TWEAK OF. THAT LAST YEAR'S MONEY TO FOCUS ON. IMPLEMENTATION IS AS WELL. OKAY I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER. QUESTIONS ON THIS MISTER O'DONNELL. YEAH I TO ME JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOGISTICS OF THIS IN THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT RIGHT THIS IS A HUGE HURDLE I THINK ON IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM SO- THE HOW DOES THIS WORK DOESN'T HAPPEN AT BIRTH BACK ENACT AN ACCOUNT IS AUTOMATICALLY OPEN ONCE A CHILD WAS GIVEN A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. AND IF SO WHERE DOES THAT MONEY GO WHAT INVESTMENT FIRM ECCENTRIC AND IF NOT TO SOMEONE GET A CHECK MAILED TO THEIR HOME HOW DO WE KNOW THEY INVESTED IT- AND OR- AND OR CASH IT OUT LATER- I'M LOOKING AT SOME OF OUR FOSTER YOUTH THAT. OUNCE FROM HOME TO HOME HOW WOULD WE ENSURE THAT THEIR PROJECT I'M SURE THIS VERY DIFFICULT ON HOW THIS IS ALL GOING TO BE. IMPLEMENTED SO I CERTAINLY WANT TO START OFF WITH SAYING I APPRECIATE. THE SIGNIFICANCE- IN THE HIGH HURDLES YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM LIKE THIS SO WITHOUT ALL. LEE AND STATE STANDARDS CULTURE ESTIMATES- SO BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO POPULATION GROUPS OF THE NEWBORN POPULATION GROUP AND THEN ALSO THE SCHOOL AGE POPULATION GROUP. SAW WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH- FIRST OF ALL WE'LL START WITH THE NEWBORN POPULATION WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. A TWO ON CLICK THE NECESSARY BIRTH REGISTRATION DATA THAT WOULD BE UTILIZED TO- IDENTIFY- AND CONTACT THE FOLKS. IT IS AN OPT OUT PROGRAM MEANING THAT THE ACCOUNT TO BE OPENED- FOR THE NEWBORNS SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF- MAKING WE'RE MAKING THEM AWARE THAT IT'D JUST THAT THEY CAN. GO ON REGISTER AXIS IT VIEW THEIR ACCOUNT BALANCE- AND THEN THERE FOR- ALSO. INTEGRATE THE- COMPONENT TO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT SCHOLAR SHARE. ON IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO OPEN THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AND CONTRIBUTE REGULARLY- FOR THE OTHER POPULATION OF THE SCHOOL AGE POPULATION WE SIMILARLY WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH WITH THE KIDS AND THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO NOTIFY THEM. IN COMBINATION WITH A COMPREHENSIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGNS AND WORKING WITH PARTNERSHIPS WITH THESE OTHER GROUPS AND IN THE SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS. TO MAKE SURE ALL THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ARE AWARE THAT THE PROGRAMS THERE AND WITH CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW. TO GO ONLINE AND- ACCESS THE ACCOUNTS. TO SERVE AS A DATE AND TIME WHEN EVERY CHILD BORN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I ASSUME WE'LL GET AN ACCOUNT. HEY IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE BEGINNING DATE- IT'S ON. JULY NE TWO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO AS WE GET THE BIRTH REGISTRATION DATA FROM PUBLIC HEALTH- AN ACCOUNT WILL BE OPEN NO MA'AM ACCOUNT THE ACCOUNT NUMBER TO FIVE TWENTY NINE. I ASSUME. RIGHT CORRECT OKAY- AND WHERE SO WHERE IS THE FILE AS IT IS THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PUT INTO A MONTH IT'S FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS I BELIEVE RIGHT. IS IT AND IT WARRANT IS A DIFFERENT AMOUNT- IT'S- TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO START. CAN WE FIGHT ALSO HAS SOME OF THE DIGITAL CENTER IS THERE FOR THE SCHOOL AGE POPULATION IS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS- AND THEN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED IF THEY'RE- HOMELESS. AND ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED IF THEY'RE FOSTER USE. SO IS THAT PUT INTO A MONEY MARKET WHOSE INVESTMENT FIRM WHO SELECTS AN INVESTMENT FIRM. DOES THE FAMILY HAVE TO THEN OPEN AN ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT OF THE DESIRE pTO PUT MORE MONEY INTO IT OR COULD THEY JUST ADDED TO THE- ACCOUNT. THAT WAS OPENED AT BIRTH HOW HOW WOULD ALL THAT WORK- FOR THE NEWBORNS THEY'RE GOING TO BE PUT INTO AN ACCOUNT- WITH SMALLER SHARE ON. THE FIFTH OF. THE HEAT THE ADDRESS ARE OPTIONAL BOARD SELECTS THAT MEETS. MEETS THAT PARTICULAR POPULATIONS INVESTMENT PRACTICE- THEY ARE GOING TO GIVEN UP. BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN THEIR OWN CULTURE COUNT. AND LINK THE TWO ACCOUNTS SO THEY CAN VIEW BOTH BALANCES- BECAUSE THEY THEY- THEY WILL BE ABLE CONTRIBUTE DIRECTED OF CALKINS ACCOUNT THAT THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR OWN SCHOLARSHIP KILKA. SO WITH IN THE CALIFORNIA I'M THE CALIBER DOLLARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOING TO WHAT TYPE IS IT A MONEY MARKET IS IT A-AND S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED WHAT KIND WHAT WHAT'S THE INVESTMENT VEHICLE THEY WOULD YEARS BECAUSE- A MONEY MARKETS NOT GONNA EARN. MUCH MONEY RIGHT THE STOCK MARKET'S GONNA DO THEM. MUCH BETTER THAN A MONEY MARKET WOULD TRADITIONALLY. SO WHAT. WHO SELECTS THAT VEHICLE YEAH IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE POPULATION FOR INSTANCE NEWBORNS- SINCE THEY HAVE A LONG TIME ORIZON THEY WOULD BE PUT INTO A ON. A WHAT WE CALL A- IN ROAMING YOUR PORTFOLIO THAT WE HAVE WITH THE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. ON THAT STRETCH OF MORE CONSERVATIVE AND ADJUSTS- A SORTS OF MORE RESIDENT BECOMES MORE CONSERVATIVE AS THEY AGED. SO THAT THE IDEAS THAT THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS SELECTED FOR EACH- POPULATION WOULD FIT THEIR- INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND INVESTMENT HORIZON. OKAY THANK YOU. YEAH I JUST JUST BACK TO THIS- SO WE HAVE SIX MILLION KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. ROUGHLY MAYBE LET'S SAY HALF OUR LOW INCOME I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO SAY. JUST FOR MY- YOU KNOW IT'S AN EXAMPLE HERE THREE MILLION KIDS AND MAYBE THAT'S NOT. LESS THAN THREE MILLION FAMILIES SO TV AD OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE FOR TWO MILLION. AS SEEMS LIKE A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY HAVING THIS MASSIVE TV CAMPAIGN WHEN THE SIMPLE THING IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WORK TO THE WORK WITH THESE KIDS ON A DAILY BASIS. SO I'M NOT SURE WHY WE'RE NOT. FOCUSING THEIR SELF WE NEED TO I THANK. REVISIT THIS AND EFFECTIVE LIKE WE WANT THIS TO WORK. AND WE AND WE AND I AND I KNOW FOR EXAMPLE FOR A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE BECAUSE- AS A CITY COUNCILMEMBER HERE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I CREATED ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS READ RAISE PRIVATE MONEY. CREATED COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FOR FAMILIES AND OPEN THEM UP WE HAD A CREDIT UNION UP OPEN THE ACCOUNTS. AND MOST THE FAMILIES WERE LIKE THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. HE HAD IMMIGRATION ISSUES I DON'T WANNA FILL PAPERWORK THEY'RE SKEPTICAL ON THIS AND THAT AND IT WAS LIKE NOW THIS IS MONEY FOR YOUR KID TO GO TO COLLEGE. AND WHEN WE TALK TO THEM LIKE OH MY GOD THAT'S AMAZING BUT LIKE YOU HAD TO HAVE A ONE ON ONE CONVERSATION. BUT JUST EVEN. SENDING THEM FOR ME INFORMATION EVEN IN THE PACKAGES IT WAS RICK THAT'S REALLY REALLY HARD. L. DISTINCT THAT WE'RE GOING TO JUST ALL OF US SAID CREATE THESE ACCOUNTS INCIDENTS PEOPLE THE MAIL ON THIS OFFICES CAN BE GOOD. THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK SO. I THINK WE NEED TO. TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN UTILIZE OUR EXISTING. MODES OF COMMUNICATION. TO DO THIS AND EFFECTIVE WAY MISTER CHAIRMAN YES I THINK YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING THERE BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO TURN THIS OVER THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S RIGHT. THEY NEED TO SEE RECEIVE RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM LIKE THIS BECAUSE I. AS YOU'RE POINTING OUT- THERE'S A LOT OF LOGISTICS. PROBABLY VERIFICATION ETCETERA THAT HAVE TO GO ON. WITH AN EFFORT LIKE THIS SO I JUST HOPE THAT AS WE CONTEMPLATE ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAT WE ALREAY GOT PLAN. THAT WE REALIZE IT'S SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED TO BE. RESOURCE DIVIDE. THEIR NORTH OKAY WE WILL- PULL THIS ISSUE OPEN. FOR ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. STUDENT LOAN BORROWER OF ASSISTANCE. K. YEAH OKAY THE NEW TESTIFIES HERE. OKAY SO WE HAVE- D. O. F. L. A. O. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROTECTION. SO FIRST DIAZ ABOUT REBEKAH KIRK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN RESPONSE THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION POTS STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO RESUME IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION OR DF PI TO IMPLEMENT THE STUDENT LOAN BORROWER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES THE GRANT PROGRAM AND MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO ASSIST CALIFORNIA STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN UNDERSTANDING THEIR RIGHTS OPTIONS AND WHERE TO FIND ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES STATUTORY CHANGES OUTLINING PROGRAM PARAMETERS AND PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY FOR D. F. P. I. TO ADJUST TO ANY FUTURE CHANGES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FINALLY THIS PROPOSAL WILL FILL GAPS IN THE EXISTING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN CALIFORNIA. LEVERAGE THE STATE'S KNOWLEDGE ON CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC STUDENT LOAN BORROWING LAWS TO PROVIDE CLEAR AND ACCURATE INFORMATION. AND UTILIZE EXISTING COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT CAN WORK DIRECTLY WITH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO FURTHER OUR REACH EFFORTS TO THESE BORROWERS. IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FOR FINANCE REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL. MY COLLEAGUES ANDREW **** AND KIMBERLY HARBISON ARE AVAILABLE VIA WEBEX TO ADDRESS THEM AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU L. A. L. THANK YOU I COME FROM THIS PROPOSAL APPEARING INTENDED BEGINNING AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWENTY SIX. THE PROPOSAL IS PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROVIDE ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION TO STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ABOUT THEIR LOAN REPAYMENT OPTIONS. WE DO HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED APPROACH AND I'LL HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THEM. THE FIRST CONCERN IS THAT THERE ARE MANY EXISTING SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON STUDENT LOANS AND REPAYMENT. INCLUDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS FROM COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC GAPS IN INFORMATION THAT REMAINED AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THESE EXISTING SOURCES. MOREOVER SOME ELEMENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IF YOU'RE A DUPLICATE THESE EXISTING RESOURCES. FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE PROPOSED FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO CREATE A BORROWER FACING WEBSITE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON STUDENT LOANS. ALTHOUGH THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARE TO MAINTAIN SUCH A WEBSITE. CONCERN WE HAVE RELATES TO THE USE OF ONE TIME FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE. PROVIDING INFORMATION TO STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IS IN MANY WAYS AN ONGOING ACTIVITY WITH THE NEW COHORT OF BORROWERS ENTERING REPAYMENT EVERY YEAR AND REQUIRING INFORMATION. WELL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COULD REACH CURRENT BARS IN THE NEAR TERM THERE ISN'T A CLEAR PROVISION TO SUSTAIN HIS ACTIVITIES AFTER THE FUNDING EXPIRES. OUR CONCERN ABOUT USING ONE TIME FUNDS IN THIS WAY IS THAT IT COULD LEAD TOA SHORT LIVED IMPACT WHILE CREATING PRESSURE FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE DOWN THE LINE. WHAT ADDITIONAL CONCERN WE HAVE RELATES TO THE CONTINUED CHANGES IN FEDERAL POLICY RELATED TO STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT. AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES NOTED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUSPENDED STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. SINCE THAT INITIAL PAUSE WAS PUT IN PLACE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS EXTENDED THE PAUSE SB SIX TIMES. AND OF THE STATE REMAINS UNCERTAIN WHETHER REPAYMENTS WILL RESUME IN SEPTEMBER IS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED OR IF THAT DATE WILL BE FURTHER POSTPONED. THIS UNCERTAINTY COULD AFFECT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT A TIMELY INFORMATION CAMPAIGN IN THE BUDGET CARE. ALSO POTENTIALLY. IMPACTING THE RELEVANCE OF THAT INFORMATION THE BUDGET YEAR. FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THAT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ASSISTANCE BE HAVING TAKEN QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU NOW HERE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND CRUCIAL TO THE CHIEF DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION INNOVATION. AT THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE OF GOVERNOR NUISANCE PRIORITIES THE FEDERAL LOAN REPAYMENT RESTARTED HERE HAS BEEN CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST YEAR- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE FUNDS BE APPROVED THIS SPRING SO WE'RE READY TO GO WHENEVER THE IDEN MINISTRATION PLANS ON THE FINAL DATE TO RESTART THESE STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS. SECOND I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES OR NONPROFITS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR EXPANDED PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS IF THEY TAKE SPECIFIC ACTION BY OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST WE CAN HELP THESE CALIFORNIANS GET THEIR STUDENT LOANS FORGIVEN. AND THAT'S MONEY THAT THEY CAN SPEND EVERY MONTH INTO THE FUTURE. THE PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE FLEXIBILITY FOR D. F. P. I. TO ADJUST THE TIMING OF OUR EFFORTS IF THE- STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT RESTART IS MOVED AGAIN. THIS WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE MONEY IN THE FIELD WHEN. THESE DATES ARE ANNOUNCED WITH ME AS MY COLLEAGUE SUZANNE MARTINDALE SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER SHE'S A NATIONWIDE EXPERT ON STUDENT LOAN ISSUES. AND CHILL OUT A LITTLE BIT. THANK YOU CHRIS. A TIME OF GREAT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND ONGOING FLUCTUATIONS IN FEDERAL POLICY. IT'S CRUCIAL FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN REPAYMENT UNDERSTAND THEIR OPTIONS AND FOR BORROWERS TO LEARN HOW TO SPOT SCAMS AND REPORT TROUBLING LOAN SERVICER BEHAVIOR TO OUR DEPARTMENT WE REGULATE STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO ALMOST FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WITH OUTSTANDING FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN ON PAUSE SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. WITH HIS REPEATED SHORT TERM EXTENSIONS THE PAYMENT POTS BY THE WHITE HOUSE BUT NO LONGER TERM PLAN GET INSIDE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. BORROWERS ARE UNDERSTANDABLY ANXIOUS ABOUT WHAT THAT WHEN THEY HAVE TO START REPAYING THE VERY WARY. OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S MIXED MESSAGES WE ARE WORKINGIN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH IS ACTIVELY URGING STATE REGULATORS LIKE THE FBI. TO PRIORITIZE BORROWER OUTREACH AND ASSISTANCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE PARTICULARLY BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST WHEN THE PSLF WAIVER EXPIRES. THE WAY TO HOLDING THESE LOANS AND MANAGING THEM IS REAL I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS SOMEONE WHO HAD STUDENT LOANS. PARTICIPATED IN THE PSLF PROGRAM AND GOT THEM CANCELED I OFTEN FOUND IT CONFUSING EVEN AS A LAWYER IN A POLICY EXPERT TO NAVIGATE THIS SYSTEM- I OFTEN STRUGGLE TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS OF MY OWN LOAN SERVICER OVER THE YEARS AND FOUND THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES CONFUSING. SO IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE THE ACUTE NEED PEOPLE HAVE FOR CLEAR AND ACCURATE INFORMATION REMINDERS ABOUT KEY DEADLINES OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTEND EVENTS AND ASK QUESTIONS OF EXPERTS. AND BETTER AWARENESS OF HOW TO FILE COMPLAINTS WHEN THEY CANNOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM ON THEIR OWN. IN FACT ONE OF OUR OWN EMPLOYEES A D. F. P. I RECENTLY HAD AN IMPASSE WITH HER SERVICER. TRYING TO ACCESS THE% WAIVER AFTER SHE FILED A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OUR STUDENT LOAN TEAM GOT INVOLVED SHE WAS ABLE TO RESOLVE THE MATTER WITH HER SERVICER AND SHE RECEIVED MORE THAN FIFTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT CANCELLATION. UNDER THE PSLF WAIVER BECAUSE WE WERE THERE TO HELP WE WANT TO HELP INSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT LOAN BORROWING CALIFORNIA CAN SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THEIR LOANS. AND THE PUBLIC SERVANTS LIKE OUR OWN STATE EMPLOYEES WITH FEDERAL LOANS CAN ACCESS THE BENEFITS OF PSLF AGAIN EXPANDED ACCESS THAT WILL EXPIRE ON OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST. SO THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP US SCALE UP RESULTS LIKE THIS EXPANDING OUR- OUTREACH. OUTREACH CAPACITIES OF THE BORROWER KNOW THEY CAN TURNTO US AS A RESOURCE. WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED COUNSELING OR LEGAL ADVICE TO BORROWERS DIRECTLY. WILL STOP THERE WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THIS IS A VERY TIMELY ISSUE MY TWITTER FEED IS BLOWING UP ABOUT CANCELING STUDENT DEBT TODAY AND- BIDEN HAS A PROPOSAL PODCAST THE DAILY YESTERDAY THEY HAD A BIG EPISODE ON THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS AND WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN SHOULD DO. THE ONE THING THAT THAT STRUCK ME AS THEY SAID THAT A LOT OF THE SERVICING COMPANIES HAVE JUST KIND OF. QUIT THIS BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ANY BUSINESS THE LAST TWO YEARS DURING THE PANDEMIC SO. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE FOUR MILLION OR SO PEOPLE ARE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT TRUE THAT THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT STARTED TODAY. EVEN THE GOVERNMENT SIDE WE WANT TO START COLLECTING STUDENT AT AGAIN. WILL MAKE NECESSARILY HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE KNOW WHO THESE FOLKS ARE BECAUSE THE SERVER. SERVICING COMPANIES. WALKED AWAY SO HOW WILL THIS. PLAY WITH COMMUNICATING WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WELL THIS IS PART OF THE SOURCE OF CONFUSION THE MANY BORROWERS HAVE ABOUT THEIR OPTIONS THERE ARE SOME LOAN SERVICERS THAT ARE EXITING THE FEDERAL SYSTEM AND OTHERS THAT ARE. ENTERING SO THERE ACTUALLY ARE TRANSFERS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WE WORK ON WITH A MULTI STATE TEAM AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. TO MONITOR LOAN TRANSFERS- ABOUT SIXTEEN MILLION. FARMERS NATIONWIDE ARE BEING TRANSFERRED FROM ONE SERVICE OR TO ANOTHER SO BORROWERS ARE GOING TO LAND SOMEWHERE WITH A NEW SERVICE OR THERE ARE STILL. COMPANIES AND IN CONTRACT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT THE FACT OF THE TRANSFER. THE POSSIBILITY FOR MISSED PAPERWORK ETCETERA DOES MAKE THIS TIME A PARTICULARLY- PARTICULARLY VEXING FOR BARBERS WHO ARE GETTING MESSAGES FROM YOU COMPANIES THEY DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST AND AGAIN THERE. IS AN OVERALL MISTRUST OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF HOW THEY'VE MISMANAGED THE STUDENT ON SYSTEM SO- WE HAVE A ROLE THAT WE CAN PLAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS THE STATE REGULATOR LITTLE CLOSER TO HOME. TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND- NOTICES YOUR NEW SERVICER YOU KNOW HERE'S WHERE YOU SEND YOURPAYMENT- AND ALSO AGAIN IF THEY- NEED TO HAVE RESOLVED A PROBLEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEY CAN FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH US AND WE CAN INVESTIGATE. MMHM SO THE NOTION HERE IS THAT THE FOUR BILLION. PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAD THEIR STUDENT DEBT SENSI FROZEN THE PAST FOUR YEARS THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'RE GONNA GET TURNED BACK ON BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW ABOUT OTHER FORGIVENESS AND OPPORTUNITIES. BUT HOW THAT WHY WOULD THAT WHY WOULD THEY EVEN DO THAT IF THE AND THEY'RE THINKING WELL THEY MAY NEVER GO BACK AND- START COLLECTING MY DAD BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING WE SHOULD CANCEL THE DEBT AND SO WE KEEP DELAYING THIS SO. IS NOT ALSO A MIXED MESSAGE. I THINK THE MESSAGE FROM US CAN CAN AND SHOULD BE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT AND ACCURATE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY. AND WE'VE ALREADY HELD A COUPLE OF FANS WOULD LOVE TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY TO DO MORE OUTREACH. TO BAR WAS TO SAY HERE'S THE CURRENT STATE OF THINGS HERE THE CURRENT DEADLINES AS WE KNOW THEM HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW TO ACCESS. ON THESE EXPANDED BENEFITS BETWEEN NOW AND I'M PARTICULARLY THAT PSLF DIED THAT'S NOT A HARD DEADLINE. FROM CONGRESS THAT WILL EXPIRE ON OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST AND AGAIN ANYONE WHO WORKS FOR THE GOVERNMENT. QUALIFIES FOR THIS PROGRAM AND MAY NOT KNOW HOW TO ACCESS AND HOW TO RAISE THEIR HAND TO CERTIFY THE FOR ELIGIBLE SO. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE THAT WE CAN HELP AS THE STATE'S FINANCIAL REGULATOR TO NAVIGATE THESE CHOPPY WATERS. OKAY YEAH. GET SOMEONE ARRESTED HELLO MISTER ABOUT. DOES ANY OF THIS EVER INCLUDING EDUCATION CAMPAIGN SO THAT STUDENTS DON'T GET THEMSELVES INTO THIS SITUATION IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE WE WERE DEALING WITH THE RESULT NOT NECESSARILY THE CAUSE. IN WILLIS EVER STOP IN THIS WE EDUCATE PEOPLE. ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEN THEY SIGN OFF ON THESE LOANS. WELL THIS PROPOSAL REALLY IS TARGETED AT PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY TAKEN OUT STUDENT DEBT AND ARE IN REPAYMENT THAT SAID ARE YOU KNOW WE WOULD LOVE TO DO OUTREACH TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH STUDENT BORROWERS CURRENTLY TODAY SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES- UNFORTUNATELY. YOU KNOW UNTIL THERE IS. INVESTMENT IN INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION SUCH THAT WE WOULD REDUCE TUITION. MOST FAMILIES TODAY SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO EDUCATION WITHOUT WITHOUT TAKING A LONG UNNING REALITY WE REALLY NEED TO HEAR MISTER CHAIR CERTAINLY ADDRESS THOSE WHO ARE IN A TOUGH SPOT. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO EDUCATE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WALKING INTO- ON THE FRONT END BECAUSE- OTHERWISE IT WILL NEVER STOP. RIGHT SAID THE SERVER NAME WE NEED TO DO A LOT FOR HERE QUITE FRANKLY YES. ADDRESS THE DEBT BUT ALSO. EDUCATE PEOPLE AS TO WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING OFF ON WHAT WHAT THE ALTAMONT- IN IMPLICATION OF WHAT WHAT THAT WILL DO THEM IN LONG TERM. PERHAPS THIS WE GET PASSED OUR FINANCIAL AID REFORM. AND THEN HAVING DEBT FREE COLLEGE THAT PEOPLE NOT. BORROWING MONEY THAT THERE DOES NOT FREE COLLEGE THEY HAVE TO PAY- THEIR FAMILY SHARE. THEY GET THEIR CAL GRANT AND THEY GET- A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY FOR STATEMENT FOR THEIR HOUSING ALLOWANCE I THINK IT'S LESS THAN A BILLION DOLLARS WERE SAYING THAT. AND THEN WE WOULD YOU KNOW. BASICALLY CUT OFF THAT NEED TO BE TO BORROW MONEY GOING FORWARD SO. THAT'S A- THING ON OUR TO DO LISTS FOR- AND- MR MEDINA IS PUSHING THAT BILL AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT- SO THIS IS THE ISSUE WE WILL. HOLDS OPENED ITS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO HEAR THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ISSUE YEAH PUBLIC COMMENT AND TRYING TO GET TO OTHER COMMITTEES NOW. SO WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH PUBLIC COMMENTS. LEADING DEMOCRAT YOU HAVE A PUMP COMMENT PLEASE. ONE ZERO. DO A FEW THAT HAVE QUEUED UP ON MY MOTHER GIVEN THEIR LINE NUMBER. OKAY. FIRST COMMENT COMES FROM THE LINE THIRTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS CODY MANNION AND I'M CALLING IN FROM THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS CENTER WE- AND WITH ABOUT TWO MILLION SUPPORTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- I'M CALLING IN BECAUSE I AM ASKING FOR SUPPORT FOR GIFT. HE IS PROPOSED- STUDENT LOAN BORROWER ASSISTANCE PLAN- AS SOMEONE WHO SPOKE TO THOUSANDS OF BORROWERS OVER THE YEARS AND HEARD ABOUT THE MANY OBSTACLES THEY FACE I KNOW- THE STUDENT LOAN SYSTEM IS FAR TOO CONVOLUTED AND COMPLEX FOR THE AVERAGE BAR TO NAVIGATE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE- THERE ARE EXISTING RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUT THEY'RE INSUFFICIENT AND THEY STILL LEAVE SO MANY GAPS FOR BORROWERS TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF- BY PREDATORY- DEBT RELIEF SCAMS AND OTHER FOR PROFIT ENTITIES- SO. WITH ALL OF THE COMPLEXITY THAT OBSTACLES PARTS OF TASTE AND ALL OF THE HARM CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC I BELIEVE IN OUR ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO INVEST IN SUPPORTING SYSTEMS FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS THROUGH EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND SO- D. F. P. I. HAS CREATED A PLAN- THE GOVERNOR HAS PROVIDED- HIS OWN BUDGETARY RECOMMENDATION WE BELIEVE THAT. THAT PROPOSED TEN MILLION DOLLARS- SHOULD ACTUALLY BE TRIPLED BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUR MILLION STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY DOLLAR WE INVEST IN SUPPORTING HEIR EDUCATION AND AWARENESS AROUND STUDENT LOAN DEBT NOT ONLY. HELPS IMPROVE AND INCREASE THEIR FINANCIAL WELLNESS BUT ACTUALLY- PROVIDES DIVIDENDS FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THESE ARE WORDS ARE LIFTED OUT OF STUDENT LOAN DELINQUENCY AND DEFAULT TO THEIR FINANCIAL WELLNESS IS IMPROVED ARE ABLE TO FULLY CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR ECONOMY- SO THIS IS THANK YOU. WELL AND JUSTICE THAT WE HAD A PREMATURE- SPEAKER THERE JUST. WE HAVE- PUBLIC HERE ON THE PHONE AND IT. WE'RE GOING TO DO IN PERSON FIRST YOU CAN YOU CAN COME BACK HERE JUST IT'S ONE MINUTE- LAST SIXTY SECONDS OR LAST FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND I WILL GO BACK TO THE MODERATOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITY COALITION REPRESENTING ABOUT TWO THIRDS. OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE- WE SUGGEST THAT YOU ACTUALLY DON'T NEED TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROJECTS IN THE STUDENT HOUSING ITEM. OUR REQUEST IS THAT YOU FIND ALL TWELVE OF THE ELIGIBLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROJECTS THAT WERE DEEMED ELIGIBLE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO THOSE OF THE PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE THE SEVEN ADDITIONAL ON PAGE SIX IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT WOULD TAKE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. I'M ALL OF THESE PROJECTS DO MEET THE AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND PRIORITIES THAT ARE IN THE STATUTE SB ONE SIXTY NINE. WHICH WE KNOW IS A TOP GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM- SOME OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN DEEMED ELIGIBLE BUT NOT RECOMMENDED BY. FOR FUNDING BY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO MEET SOME OF THOSE OTHER KEY PRIORITIES SUCH AS BEING SHOVEL READY. I'M AS A BACK UP IF THERE'S NOT AN% ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND AVAILABLE YOU CAN CERTAINLY ADVANCE FUND FROM THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR APPLICATION THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED BUT I WANT TO REALLY MAKE THE POINT THAT DELAYED DOES HARM VIABLE PROJECTS A COST ESCALATION IS NOT AN ABSTRACTION. WE'VE SEEN COSTS INCREASED BY ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT. IN MANY REGIONS OF THE STATE OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT MEANS FEWER BEDS WITH THE STATE'S INVESTMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FROM DF PI FOR OUTREACH TO STUDENT BORROWERS AT LEAST 23% OF NONPROFIT EMPLOYEES HAD SIGNIFICANT STUDENT LOAN DEBT. THIS DEBT HAMPERS THE ABILITY OF THE SECTOR TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN RETAIN THE WORK FORCE WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR ONE IN FOURTEEN JOBS STATEWIDE. IN JANUARY WE HOSTED A WEAPON ARE ON THE PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM WE HAD OVER THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE REGISTER FOR THE WEAPON ARE AND MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED NONPROFITS PARTICIPATE NONPROFIT STAFF PARTICIPATED.
