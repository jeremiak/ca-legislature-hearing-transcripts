I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.457

STRESS DISORDER PTSD.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.580
BUT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.048
ACQUIRING AND CARING FOR A

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.250
SERVICE DOG.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.851
CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO NEARLY TWO

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.953
MILLION VETERANS THE HIGHEST OF

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.321
ANY STATE IN OUR UNION.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:36.689
THESE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.191
RESTORE LIVES DURING THEIR

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.159
MILITARY SERVICE IN SOME CASES

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.462
SUFFERED SEVERE TRAUMA THAT

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.964
RESULTED IN PTSD. FOR VETERANS

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.900
THERE IS A LACK OF ACCESS TO

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:48.735
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THIS

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.770
IS MADE REINTEGRATION INTO

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.906
NORMAL CIVILIAN LIFE CHALLENGING

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.007
FOR THESE VETERANS AND FOR THEIR

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:55.174
FAMILIES.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.709
THE TRAUMA THAT SOME VETERANS

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.578
INTER AS A RESULT OF COMBAT

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.713
SERVICE HAS ALSO LED TO

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.015
INCREASED RATES OF SUICIDE.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.585
SADLY 5220% VETERANS SUFFER FROM

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:06.786
PTSD.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.656
AND ON AVERAGE TWENTY VETERANS

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:10.523
PER DAY.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.759
OR ONE EVERY SIXTY FIVE MINUTES

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.260
COMMIT SUICIDE.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.762
THAT IS A RATE ONE AND A HALF

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:19.332
TIMES HIGHER THAN NOT VETERANS.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.099
EARLIER THIS MONTH THREE US

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.234
MILITARY VETERANS DIED BY

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:24.671
SUICIDE OVER A SPAN OF FIVE DAYS

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.472
ALL IT BE A FACILITIES.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.007
THIS LOSS OF LIFE IS TRAGIC AND

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:29.475
UNACCEPTABLE.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:30.543
OUR VETERAN COMMUNITY IS

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.178
SUFFERING AND IS CRITICAL THAT

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:33.880
WE FIND WAYS TO REDUCE VETERANS

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:34.914
SO SITES.

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.916
STUDIES AND NUMEROUS EXAMPLES

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.451
SHOW THAT PAIRING VETERANS WITH

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:41.120
SERVICE DOGS HAS A SIGNIFICANT

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:42.355
EFFECT ON REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.790
PTSD.

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.892
UNFORTUNATELY ACCESSING SERVICE

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.827
DOGS CAN BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.195
FOR VETERANS TO TO COSTS.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:51.197
LACK OF AWARENESS AND LITTLE TO

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.099
NO SUPPORT FROM STATE OR LOCAL

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.767
GOVERNMENT.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.102
ALTHOUGH SOME NONPROFITS WORK TO

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.670
PAIR VETERANS WITH SERVICE

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:58.938
STOCKS ACROSS HER STATES.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:00.340
THERE ARE STATE THEIR SOURCES

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:02.175
RESOURCES ARE LIMITED SO MUCH

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:03.776
MORE CAN BE DONE AND MUST BE

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:04.444
DONE.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.245
THIS MEASURE WOULD AWARD GRANTS

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:07.480
TO CERTIFIED VETERANS SERVICE

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.449

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.953
COST OF ACQUIRING A SERVICE DOG.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.722
AND PROVIDING TRAINING EQUIPMENT

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.223
AND VETS SERVICES.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.725
SB THREE TWELVE WILL ENSURE THAT

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.726
VETERANS ARE PROVIDED THE

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.928
ASSISTANCE NEEDED TO CARE FOR A

I'M A MARATHON RUNNER A MOM

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:58.631
ACOSTA COLLEGES AND AN

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:03.169
EDUCATIONAL CYCLE -- I AM HERE --

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:05.338
FOR THE VETERANS AND BECAUSE

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:07.607
THEY HAVE INSPIRED ME SO MUCH --

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.509
I WAS DOING RESEARCH A COUPLE OF

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:14.147
YEARS AGO AFTER MY FATHER PASSEDAWAY -- ON WORLD WAR ONE WORLD

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.448
WAR TWO AND THE KOREAN WAR ARE

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:17.583
JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT MY

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.252
FATHER GRANDFATHER HAD GONE

00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:19.852
THROUGH BUT THEIR EXPERIENCES

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:20.553
WERE LIKE.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.622
AND I RAN ACROSS AN ARTICLE THAT

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.157
TALKED ABOUT THE TWENTY TWOS.

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:25.725
I'M A CIVILIAN AND I NEVER HEARD

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:28.294
ABOUT IT AND I WAS QUITE SHOCKED

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.196
I CAN BELIEVE THAT -- THAT WAS

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:31.864
OCCURRING AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:33.766
ALSO THAT THE REST OF THE

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.802
CIVILIAN POPULATION THAT I KNEW

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.336
OF DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS EITHER.

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:39.238
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S NOT ON

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:40.840
THE TV NEWS EVERY NIGHT -- I

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.208
TALKED TO MY COLLEAGUES MY

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.110
FRIENDS MANY PEOPLE AND NOBODY

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.578
KNEW ABOUT IT.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.680
AND I REALIZE THAT -- THAT

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:48.981
NEEDED TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.283
THEY WERE NOT AWARE ABOUT THIS

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.184
PROBLEM THEN HOW ARE YOU GOING

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.785
TO HELP TO CHANGE IT ONCE WERE

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:56.856
ALL WHERE THEN WE CAN REALLY

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:58.157
WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE CHANGE.

00:05:58.224 --> 00:05:59.225
SO YOU MIGHT THINK I'M TOO SO

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:00.293
MUCH IS SHORT OF A PICNIC BUT IN

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:01.461

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:46.105
BECAUSE THERE IS A STILL SMALL

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.507
SLIVER OF ROAD THAT I COULD.

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:50.443
RUN ACROSS AND I JUST STARTED

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.978
THINK YOU KNOW MAN I I DON'T

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:52.779
THINK I'M GOING TO MAKE IT YOU

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:54.647
KNOW I I THINK THIS IS JUST

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:55.748
REALLY RISKY.

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:56.816
I THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE YOU KNOW

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.684
I WONDER VETERANS EVER SAY THAT

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.219
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:01.521
MAKE IT THIS IS REALLY RISKY.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:02.622
I THOUGHT ABOUT THEM AND I

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.090
REMEMBER THE REASON WHY I

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:05.525
STARTED OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:07.326
AND THEN I REALIZED YEAH AT THIS

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:09.028
VERY MOMENT SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.063
ARE OVERSEAS THEY'RE FIGHTING

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.098
FOR ME THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR MY

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:13.933
COME MY COUNTRY AND THEY'RE NOT

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.501
GIVING INTO FEAR THEY'RE NOT

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:16.435
QUITTING.

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:18.437
AND SO I DECIDED NO MATTER WHAT

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:21.641
FOR THEM I'M GONNA FINISH OR DIE

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:22.909
TRYING.

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:24.277
AND SO I DID FINISH AND I'M HERE

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:25.778
AND I'M TRYING TO FIGHT FOR IT

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:26.846
FOR THIS BILL FOR THEM BECAUSE

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.781
IT'S SO HELPFUL -- YOU WENT OVER

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:30.683
SOME OF THE FACTS -- THE SUICIDE

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.051
RATE IF YOU LOOK AT IT A YEARLY

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.420
NUMBERS OVER SEVEN THOUSAND TWO

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:35.188
HUNDRED PER YEAR.

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.422
AND I'M APPOINTED WITH

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.357
PERSONALLY OF SOME FAMILIES NOW --

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.193
MANY FAMILIES NOW THAT HAVE LOST

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.328
THEIR SENSE TO TO SUICIDE.

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:44.997
THE CURRENT TREATMENT FOR PTSD

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:46.566
IS MEDICATION AND PSYCHOTHERAPY

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.967
THIS PROVIDES ITS BENEFIT FOR

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:51.103
ALMOST ABOUT 70% BUT THE OTHER

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.838
30%.

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.673
DON'T BENEFIT FROM THIS

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.608
COMBINATION THE TWO OF THEM IS

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:56.742
ALL THAT THEY HAVE OPTION TO

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:58.311
THEIR VERY RARELY ARE OFFERED

00:07:58.377 --> 00:07:59.712
ANY OTHER OPTIONS.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.648
BUT THE THIRD OPTION IS -- YOU

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:04.016
KNOW IF THE SOONEST THEIR ARMS

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:07.153
SERVICE DOG -- THE 30% OF THEIR

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.988
OFFER THIS THIRD OPTION THAT

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:10.489
WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL THE

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:11.591
SERVICE ON TREATMENT HAS A

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:13.693
REALLY HIGH RATE OF SUCCESS --

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.995
AT DECREASING SUICIDALITY AND

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:17.864
INCREASING LIFE SATISFACTION --

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.065
THERE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:19.799
YEARS THERE'S BEEN SOME

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:21.968
EMPIRICAL STUDIES THAT VALIDATED

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:24.570
THIS AS A TREATMENT -- RECENT

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:26.906
STUDIES FROM THE PURDUE-UNIVERSITY OUR DEPARTMENT OF

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:28.708
ANIMAL SCIENCE DID A

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:30.476
PHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY ON CORTISOL

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:31.244
LEVELS.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.578
WHERE'S ALL LEVELS BEING IN THE

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:34.447
HOME ON THAT THE BODY SECRETES

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:36.148
WHEN IT'S UNDER HIGH CRIME THIS

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:37.984
CHRONIC STRESS.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.085
AND THE CORTISOL LEVELS WERE

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:40.853
DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THIS

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.557
RESEARCH STUDY -- SO WITH -- DR --

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:47.960
HERE IS ALSO FROM THAT -- ANIMAL

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.729
SCIENCE -- DEPARTMENT SHE'S ALSO

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.330
WORKED WITH THE CENTER FOR HUMAN

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:52.465
ANIMAL BOND.

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:54.233
AND SHE FOUND THAT COMPARED TO

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.168
INDIVIDUALS ON THE WAIT LIST FOR

00:08:56.235 --> 00:08:57.670
SERVICE DOGS THOSE WHO ACTUALLY

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:58.938
HAD SERVICE DOGS HAD THE

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:01.040
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER CYCLE

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:02.208
SOCIAL HEALTH INCREASED

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:03.242
EMOTIONAL HEALTH.

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:09.882
INCREASE SOCIAL AND WORK AND

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:10.549

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:11.751
AND SHE ALSO WAS WORKING WITH

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:13.552
THE STUDY ON CORTISOL LEVELS AND

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:14.854
THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT FINDING --

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:16.656
FINALLY -- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:17.590
YOU KNOW ABOUT SERVICE DOGS --

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:19.358
BUT THEY ARE SET APART

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:21.327
PROMOTIONAL AND OF SIR A

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:23.562
MOTIONAL SUPPORT DOGS AND CATS.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:24.830
BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THEY

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:25.564

A FEW OF THEM THAT ARE SPECIFIC

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.348
TO PTSD.

ANOTHER THING THAT CAME OUT THE

THERE ARE WAYS TO ADVANCE A

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:41.077
COMPLAINT IN THE STATE SYSTEM

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:42.445
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:43.579
THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT

01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:44.981
ANYBODY TAKE ANY ACTION ON IT

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.782
AND THAT CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:49.018
PROBLEM.

IS A FINDING OF THE VERY FEW-INSTANCES.

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.130

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:07.136
WE SEE IS THAT IMPORTANT AS AS A

01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:08.604
DEFICIENCY IN THE STATE PROCESS --

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.039

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:31.661
THE BEST WAY TO DO IT.

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:18.473
THE IN THIS CASE I GUESS IT

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:19.942
WOULD BE THE SECRETARY OF ARMY

01:16:20.008 --> 01:16:21.376
INSPECTOR GENERAL.

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:22.711
AND THEN ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:25.280
DEFENSE IG FOR PURPOSES OF

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:27.783
TRACKING REVIEW.

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:29.518
APPROVAL BECAUSE OF THE

01:16:29.584 --> 01:16:33.956
SENSITIVITY OF REPRISAL CASES AS

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:34.456
EARLY TO UNDERSTAND NOT

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.223
NECESSARILY.

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:37.859
IT IS REPORTED AYE I UNDERSTAND --

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.761
BUT AND CRACKED BUT THE

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:43.632
INVESTIGATION AND BE ACTUALLY

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:44.566
COMPLETED STRICTLY WITH.

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:46.468
SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE IS

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:48.770
A PROCESS.

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:50.205
THAT EXTENDS FROM THE STATE.

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:51.873
OF THROUGH THE MILITARY

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.275
DEPARTMENT PENTAGON.

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:55.677
AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

01:16:55.744 --> 01:17:00.782
WHAT'S BROKEN ABOUT THAT PROCESS --

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:03.485
I THINK THE OF MANIFESTATION IF

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:05.153
I THINK IT MAY NOT BE BROKEN ON

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.856
IT SPACE IN THE SENSE OF THE

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:09.324
ARCHITECTURE OF IT SIR.

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:10.926
YEAH BUT I MEAN THE ORIGINAL

01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:13.495
INTENT OF THE REGULATORY SCHEME.

01:17:13.562 --> 01:17:15.831
BUT I THINK WHAT WERE REFERRING

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:17.499
TO AND WHAT THIS BILL IS DUE

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:20.602
ADDRESSES THAT IS OUR ACTUALLY

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:21.536
FUNCTION.

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:23.438
IN A WAY THAT I THINK THE

01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:24.873
WITNESS WAS EXPRESSING FOR OUR

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:25.741
OWN PERSPECTIVE.

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:26.742
YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THE THE

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.310
FAILURE TO ACTUALLY FUNCTION AS

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:29.244
INTENDED.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:30.712
AND AND WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:33.415
OF MILITARY OVERSIGHT TO COME

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:35.417
HAVE AN I. G.'S BY THE ARMY

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:40.422
REGULATIONS -- ARE REPORTABLE.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:40.989
AND REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:41.490
COMING.

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:42.858
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THERE'S NOT

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:44.726
A COMMAND -- WELL -- AND THE

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:46.962
SUBORDINATE LEVEL THE PENTAGON

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:48.530
THE IG WORKS WITH SECRETARY HAS

01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:49.998
CORRECT RIGHT AND ACTUALLY THAT

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:51.400
IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:53.268
FEDERAL ID.

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:54.936
SYSTEM THERE ARE VARIOUS --

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.738
STANDARD FOR THE I NEED TO BE

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:59.708
ABLE TO TAKE INDEPENDENT ACT OF

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:02.344
THE D. O. D. COMMANDER -- WHICH

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:04.179
DOESN'T EXIST AT STATE LEVEL SO

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:05.714
THIS AT STATE LEVEL THE DATA

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:09.484
THAT STATE IG -- ACTUALLY -- I I

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:11.553
THINK EVEN THAT -- THE CASE OF

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:14.756
OF MAJOR STERLING THAT --

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:15.791
EVERYONE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH --

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:17.926
POINTED OUT THAT COURT I'VE GOT

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:18.527
A COPY OF THAT I CAN READ THE

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:22.764
BILL LANGUAGE POINT OUT THAT --

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:30.806
THE IN THE STATE I G. SYSTEM THE

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.474
STATE I. G. -- REPRISAL COMPLAIN

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.043
ONLY NEEDS TO DO THREE OF THE

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:36.912
SEVEN ACID TESTS CORRECT WHEREAS

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.246
THE DOD IG WOULD DO ALL SEVEN

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:42.417
AND SO -- I THINK THAT THE

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:43.485
ARCHITECTURE OF THE DAY YOU'RE

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:44.186
GOING TO SERVE SEEMS LIKE IT

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:45.287
WOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE.

01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:50.225
BUT THE ACTUAL -- IMPLEMENTATION

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:55.363
THE THE ACT WILL PERFORMANCE OF

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.964
WELL LET ME TELL YOU HERE'S MY

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:56.798
PROBLEM.

01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:57.632
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BEEN THERE

01:18:57.699 --> 01:18:58.266
MAY BE A WAY TO WORK AROUND THIS

01:18:58.333 --> 01:18:58.900
WITH RESPECT TO THOSE FOLKS WHO

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:00.335
RUN THE STATE MILITIA WHO NEVER

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:00.635
PERFORMED.

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:03.672
TITLE TENER TITLE.

01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:05.273
THIRTY TO A DUTY.

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:05.874
WHETHER THEY'RE VOLUNTEER OR

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:06.675
THERE IF THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:11.079
PAID -- I HAVE A PROBLEM HAVING

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:12.714
ONE PERSON THE SAME PERSON

01:19:12.781 --> 01:19:14.316
SUBJECT TO A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:16.985
ACTION OR NOT DEPENDING ON WHAT

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:18.653
SET OF ORDERS THEY GET.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.889
AND WHO'S PAYING FOR THE DUTY.

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:23.091
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO I HAVE A

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:23.959
PROBLEM.

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:27.062
SUBJECTING A MILITARY MEMBER TO

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:28.763
A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.332
WHEN IF THERE IS AN IG

01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:32.434
INVESTIGATION AND A REPORT THE

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.002
INVESTIGATION FINDS THE

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:36.304
COMPLAINT UNSUBSTANTIATED AND

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:38.340
THEN WE SUBJECT THE MILITARY

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:40.208
MEMBER TO AN OUTSIDE PRIVATE

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:41.743
RIGHT OF ACTION IN A SUPERIOR

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:43.178
COURT WITH A WHOLE BUNCHOF

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:44.045
ATTORNEYS?

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.313
AND I'VE AS THE OFF THROUGH THE

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.882
QUESTION IN THE FACE OF AN

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:49.484
UNSUBSTANTIATED FINDING BY A IG

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:51.286
STATE OR FEDERAL WOULD NOT THE

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:52.587
STATE HAVE AN OBLIGATION AT THAT

01:19:52.654 --> 01:19:54.322
POINT TO AT LEAST PROVIDE A

01:19:54.389 --> 01:19:55.323
DEFENSE.

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.926
IF NOT AN INDEMNITY DEPENDING ON

01:19:57.993 --> 01:19:59.961
THE RESULT -- IN THE DEPENDING

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:02.764
ON THE RESULTS I HAVE A PROBLEM

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:04.132
ON THOSE TWO LEVELS -- I THINK

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:05.500
ULTIMATELY -- IN A DIFFERENT

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:07.269
SETTING WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:12.040
THIS OUT SO THAT -- THE OFFICERS

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.742
THE YOUNG OFFICERS CONCERNS ARE

01:20:13.808 --> 01:20:15.243
ADDRESSED YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:16.111
THERE ARE.

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:17.579
MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE MILITARY

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:20.148
SYSTEM WHO RUN SATISFIED BY IG.

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:21.683
INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MOST

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:23.318
SENSITIVE CASES OBVIOUSLY WE

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:24.519
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:25.654
PROCESS WORKS.

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:26.922
BUT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S DO

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:29.658
THEIR JOB FREE OF INFLUENCE BY

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:31.960
ANYBODY -- AND APPROPRIATE

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:33.828
DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS TAKEN AND

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:36.064
WE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT SOME

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:37.999
POINT WE CAN REVISIT THIS PRIDE

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:39.034
OF RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.769
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I THAT

01:20:40.835 --> 01:20:42.370
I'VE OUTLINED WHICH IS FROM MY

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:43.705
PERSPECTIVE I DON'T SPEAK FOR

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:44.606
THE CHAIR.

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.575

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:10.599
BEST APPROACH BUT AS PRIDE RIGHT

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:13.001
RIGHT OF ACTION IS TO DEFINE IT.

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:14.169

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:55.937
OR DIDN'T COVER ALL THE BASES

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:57.172
AND YOU THINK YOU'VE STILL BEEN

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:58.506
WRONG AND YOU'VE BEEN DAMAGED

01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:00.275
IT'S WORTH IT TO YOU TO ACTUALLY

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:01.943
MOVE FORWARD AND YOU FIND A

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:02.477
COUNCIL.

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:05.180
IT'S WORTH IT FOR HIM OR HER TO

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:05.980
TO EITHER.

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:07.949
PUT THEIR TIME ON THE LINE TO GO

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:08.983
FORWARD.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:11.853
THEN JUST AS IT WERE WITH THE

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.722
CIVILIAN YOU CAN MOVE OR I THINK

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:16.124
IT'S UNLIKELY BUT BUT WE

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:18.593
SHOULDN'T PROVIDE I MY VIEW WE

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:19.894
SHOULD NOT PROVIDE.

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:21.629
THE PROTECTION FOR SOMEONE WHO

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:23.465
HARASSES LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.699
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE.

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:27.302
OF SOMEONE URINATES IN SOMEONE

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:29.704
ELSE'S BOOTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:30.839
INTIMIDATING THEM.

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:33.341
AND THEN IT'S REPORTED THAT

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.977
THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH RESPECT

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:37.679
TO THE COMMAND.

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:39.714
PERSON WEATHER IS THE PERSON

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:41.383
WHO'S BOOT SAID BEEN URINATED

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:43.251
UPON OR WHETHER IT'S ANOTHER

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:45.587
PERSON WHO'S TRYING.

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:47.389
TO UNRAVEL WHATEVER'S GOING ON

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:49.324
THE COMMAND THAT WOULD.

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:51.726
PROVIDE FOR THAT ENVIRONMENT.

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:53.027
IN THEIR RETALIATE AGAINST THE

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:55.029
PERSON WHO DOES THE RETALIATION

01:23:55.096 --> 01:23:56.197
MERELY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:59.033
UNIFORM SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN ANY

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.069
GREATER PROTECTIONS.

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:02.737
THEN A CIVILIAN. EIGHT OFFICER

01:24:02.804 --> 01:24:05.039
IN THE MILITARY NON COMMISSIONED

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:06.741
OFFICER OR ENLISTED PERSON WHO

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:08.743
HARASSES AND I'M GONNA SAY A

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:13.014
WOMAN SHOULD NOT BE PROTECTED.

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:14.315
ANY MORE THAN A CIVILIAN.

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:17.419
THEY SHOULD FACE THE SAME CIVIL

01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:19.187
CONSEQUENCES NOW THE INSPECTOR

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:20.388
GENERAL CONCLUDES THAT THERE WAS

01:24:20.455 --> 01:24:22.023
NO WRONGDOING MY GUESS IS THEY

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.658
DON'T FILE LAWSUITS BUT IF THE

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.093
PERSON BELIEVES THAT THEY'RE

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.594
SOMEHOW INADEQUATE.

01:24:26.661 --> 01:24:28.029
THEN THEN IT'S THE IT'S THE SAME

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:30.465
STATUS IT'S THE SAME STATUS.

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:32.667
WE SHOULD NOT BE WE AS A

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:35.036
LEGISLATURE WE AS A STATE THIS

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:37.305
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD NOT BE IN

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:39.474
THE POSITION OF PROTECTING.

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:41.676
THOSE WHO RUN STATE MILITARY

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:44.279
DUTY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:45.480
WEARING UNIFORMS.

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:46.381
AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:48.049
SAYING SIR I REALLY DO BUT I'M

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:50.251
JUST MY ISSUE IS IS THAT WE HAVE

01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:51.453
A CHAIN OF COMMAND TO ME OF

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:53.087
UNITED STATES MILITARY RIGHT

01:24:53.154 --> 01:24:54.689
THAT IT IT HERE'S TO A CHAIN OF

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:55.723
COMMAND.

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:57.192
IT'S INVESTIGATED COMPLAINTS ARE

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:58.793
BY INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT HAS AN

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:00.195
APPEAL PROCESS TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:02.330
OF DEFENSE ON THE FEDERAL SIDE

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:03.898
EVEN IF ITS TITLE TEN ISSUES.

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:06.201
SO THERE IS A AN APPEAL PROCESS

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:08.303
IN SO I GUESS.

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:09.637
I THINK THERE'S ADEQUATE

01:25:09.704 --> 01:25:11.239
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO GO ALL

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:12.540
THE WAY TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL IF

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:13.908
NEED BE IF SOMEONE HAD A

01:25:13.975 --> 01:25:15.009
COMPLAINT.

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:18.513
AND SO I DO I I HAVE A HUGE

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.547
ISSUE WITH THAT BECAUSE I

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:20.715
BELIEVE THEY'RE SEPARATE I DO

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:21.716
BELIEVE THEY'RE SEPARATE AND I

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.084
UNDERSTAND SAME THE SAME.

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:25.420
CONCESSIONS AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:26.888
BUT TO CREATE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:29.824
ACTION IN A MILITARY SCENARIO

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:32.093
WHERE THERE IS A COMMANDCENTER.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.228
AND YOU TAKE THINGS OUT OF THE

01:25:33.294 --> 01:25:35.363
CHAIN OF COMMAND CASTING CONTROL

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:36.631
YOU ALSO.

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:38.233
REMOVE THE APPEAL PROCESS EVEN

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:39.601
INSPECTOR GENERAL WHO DOES THEIR

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:41.669
DUE DILIGENCE AND IS A COMPLETE

01:25:41.736 --> 01:25:42.337
INVESTIGATION.

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:45.773
FINDS NO FINDINGS OR AND YOU

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:46.774
KNOW WE'RE ENTITIES TO

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:48.142
INSTANTIATE A COMPLAINT.

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:49.477
AND THEN IF THEY WANTED TO

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:50.612
APPEAL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:25:50.678 --> 01:25:52.413
DEFENSE THEY FIND IT NO FINDINGS

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.982
ON A SUBSTANTIATED COMPLAINT AND

01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:58.419
THEN YOU STILL HAVE A

01:25:58.486 --> 01:25:59.187
RETALIATORY MECHANISM.

01:25:59.254 --> 01:25:59.721
MOST PEOPLE IN THE PRIVATE

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:01.222
SECTOR JUST SETTLE TO GET RID OF

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:01.823
IT SO LET'S GO THERE.

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:02.924
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THERE'S A

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:04.092
PART OF THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:05.293
GENERAL ACT IN THOSE ATTORNEYS A

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.662
FILE THOSE LAWSUITS GET ABOUT

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:08.930
33240%.

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:10.832
OF THE CASE SETTLEMENT WHAT'S

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:12.300
THE PERCENTAGE THAT YOU WOULD

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:14.102
GET AS AN ATTORNEY FROM THE DOT

01:26:14.168 --> 01:26:15.770
UNLESS YOU MISTER BLISS HARM

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:18.006
HARMLESS YES.

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:18.640
GO AHEAD AND SAY THAT OVER TIME

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:19.574
AND THAT IN CASH WHAT'S YOUR THE

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:22.877
PROCESS I'M SURE YOU TAKE IT ON

01:26:22.944 --> 01:26:24.779
A CONTINGENCY.

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:25.446
I DON'T KNOW I'VE NEVER TAKEN IN

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:27.315
THOSE CASES NEVER TAKEN THIS.

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:28.116
ONE OF YOUR CLIENTS NO SHE'S NOT

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:29.851
HE IS NOT.

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:31.486
AT UC GENERAL BALD AND HOW MANY

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:34.789
TIMES.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:38.126
I THINK THREE OR THREE THREE

01:26:38.192 --> 01:26:38.726
HAVE YOU BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND I

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:40.562
HAVE NOT.

01:26:40.628 --> 01:26:41.729
SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT

01:26:41.796 --> 01:26:43.364
BOTHERS ME IS THAT THE LAWS IN

01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:45.733
PLACE AND THERE ARE LAWS IN

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.268
PLACE WHERE INSPECTOR CHEN HAS

01:26:47.335 --> 01:26:49.037
IN LET ME GO THERE HAS INSPECTOR

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:50.104

ON THE CASES THAT YOU'VE SO

01:26:50.738 --> 01:26:51.906
GENERAL BALDING AND HAVE THE

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:53.675
INSPECTOR GENERAL PROVIDED AND

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:57.045
SUBSTANTIATED COMPLAINTS OR AN

01:26:57.111 --> 01:27:00.214
INVESTIGATION.

01:27:00.281 --> 01:27:00.782
ENTER ONE ONE THING FIRST.

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:02.350
SOME OF THE RECENT REPORTS FROM

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:02.850
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:03.117
CONGRESS.

01:27:03.184 --> 01:27:05.920
SHOW THAT 90% OF THE REPRISAL

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:07.522
COMPLAINTS THEY RECEIVE.

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:09.123
SOMEWHERE IN THAT AREA BETWEEN

01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:10.858
8090% OR MORE.

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:11.759
OUR CLOTHES WITHOUT AN

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:14.762
INVESTIGATION.

01:27:14.829 --> 01:27:17.865
THEY JUST CLOSE THEM.

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:20.735
THEY'RE NOT INVESTIGATED.

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:22.537
SEVENTIES INVESTIGATED HIM.

01:27:22.604 --> 01:27:23.705
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WILL --

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:25.573
REPORTING THAT THEIR CLOTHES

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.474
WITHOUT INVESTIGATION.

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:27.809
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IN

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:28.943
TERMS OF WHAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:30.411
DONE TO CLOSE IT.

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:31.913
DIDN'T SEND ANYBODY AROUND ASK

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:32.847
QUESTIONS.

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:33.681
AND THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.683
IS THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS BROKEN

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.352
DOWN IN THAT RESPECT.

01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:38.753
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY IF THE

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:41.122
INVESTIGATE IF THE ID DOESN'T DO

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:42.757
THE INVESTIGATION DISCRETION.

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:44.425
IT'S DISCRETIONARY IT IS. TO GO

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:46.527
TO THE DOT IF THEY TAKE IT UP IS

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:49.597
DISCRETIONARY THEY DON'T HAVE TO

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:50.832
TAKE IT UP.

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:51.532
AND WHEN THE MAJOR IS HERE SHE'S

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:52.800
MADE A COMMENT THAT NINETY NINE

01:27:52.867 --> 01:27:55.970
POINT 99%

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:57.905
OF I. G. COMPLAINTS.

01:27:57.972 --> 01:28:00.808
THE G. SAID NINETY NINE POINT

01:28:00.875 --> 01:28:02.577
99% OF I. G. COMPLAINTS.

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:03.945
DON'T FALL IN FAVOR OF THE

01:28:04.012 --> 01:28:05.413
PLAINTIFF I THINK THE REPRISAL

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.348
COMPLACENT STAINED BY THE DOD

01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:09.484
ARE AROUND 1% SOMEWHERE IN THAT

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:10.385
AREA.

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:11.753
DO YOU HAVE DOCUMENTATION I CAN

01:28:11.819 --> 01:28:13.121
PROVIDE THAT YOUR OFFICE I WOULD

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:15.790
BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU WHAT I HAVE

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:16.624
I DON'T HAVE IT WITH ME.

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:18.593
OKAY SO I LIKE I SAID I HAVE A

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:21.062
HUGE ISSUE -- I REALLY DO HAVE A

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.163
HUGE ISSUE WITH THE STATE

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:23.197
INTERFERING WITH THE MILITARY

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:24.565
COMMAND THAT HAS AN APPEAL

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:26.868
PROCESS TO THE DOD I AND I'M A

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:28.036
FEMALE VETERAN ON THE FIRST

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:28.836
FEMALE VETERAN THAT'S EVER

01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:30.304
SERVED IN THIS BUILDING.

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:34.142
SO I GET IT AND AND YOU KNOW I'M

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:35.410

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:36.344
BUT I'M THE BY STEERING AND I

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:37.345
WOULD REALLY GAS THAT YOU'RE NOT

TO ACCEPT THESE AMENDMENTS.

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.615
AND I WOULD SUPPORT THE TERROR

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:43.618
NOT ACCEPTING LIMITED BECAUSE TO

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:58.633
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE PROBLEM --

01:28:58.700 --> 01:28:59.801
IN IN TOTAL IF NOT AT LEAST IN

01:28:59.867 --> 01:29:01.035
LARGE PART WASTHAT THE INITIAL

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:02.737
INVESTIGATION WAS A COMMANDER

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:04.338
DIRECTED INVESTIGATION.

01:29:04.405 --> 01:29:05.907
UNDER THE INHERENT AUTHORITY OF

01:29:05.973 --> 01:29:08.676
THE COMMANDER THAT WAS --

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:10.678
PERHAPS MISHANDLED AND THAT WAS

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:12.480
THE MATTER WAS ELEVATED TO THE

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:14.382
STATE IG IN THE FEDERAL IG IN

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:15.817

01:29:15.883 --> 01:29:17.018
THINGS STARTED TO HAPPEN

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:18.920
INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF OFFICERS

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.755
AND INVESTIGATIONS IT'S MY

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:22.090
UNDERSTANDING ARE STILL ON GOING.

01:29:22.156 --> 01:29:24.392
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY IN THE

01:29:24.459 --> 01:29:25.526
AUDIENCE HERE.

01:29:25.593 --> 01:29:26.127
THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING OTHER

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.228
THAN THAT.

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:28.329
BUT I THINK THERE'S A PATH

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:31.265
FORWARD HERE FOR YOU I THINK THE

01:29:31.332 --> 01:29:33.868
PATH FORWARD IS.

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:35.436

RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:29:39.941 --> 01:29:41.876
AND THEN WORK FOR WORK WITH THE

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:43.311
FOLKS IN ON THE COMMITTEE HERE

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:45.113
AS A MOVES OUT OF THE COMMITTEE

01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:47.949

CRAFT LANGUAGE AS YOU WERE.

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:53.387

01:29:58.626 --> 01:30:01.763

01:30:09.504 --> 01:30:11.038
WILLING TO HAVE THAT

01:30:11.105 --> 01:30:14.175
CONVERSATION BUT THE ALTERNATIVE

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:16.244
IS. TO TO DO GO DOWN THE PATH

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:20.414
YOU'RE GOING SO THAT'S UP TO YOU

01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:21.582

NORTHERN HOMAGE [inaudible]

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:27.021

YOUR SUGGESTION I THINK THAT'S A

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:32.360
WISE IDEA AND IF THAT'S

01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:33.528
ACCEPTABLE TO CHEER WHAT I I'VE

ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:36.030
WE WON'T INCLUDE THE PARTICULAR

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:38.933
ONE THAT'S AT ISSUE RIGHT NOW --

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.168
I DON'T WANT TO BE.

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:41.302
A DISINGENUOUS SO IT'S AN AREA

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:42.870
WHERE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IN

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:43.805
AND WILL BRING IT BACK TO

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:45.106
COMMITTEE -- IF THERE'S ANY

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:47.308
SIGNIFICANT SUBS OF CHANGE FROM

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:48.242
THE POINT IN TIME WHEN IT LEAVES

01:30:48.309 --> 01:30:49.977
THE COMMITTEE.

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:50.578
BUT LET ME RESPOND TO SENATOR

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:52.046
GROW.

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:54.916
THIS IS SORT OF AN APPLES AND

01:30:54.982 --> 01:30:57.118
ORANGE THING -- FIRST AS THE

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:58.452
GERMAN BOB.

01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:00.421
I KNOW ONLY THE GENERAL BALDWIN

01:31:00.488 --> 01:31:02.156
IS AN EFFECTIVE HONORABLE

01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:04.525
OFFICER THIS IS NOT ABOUT

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:06.027
GENERAL BONUS ON ABOUT APRIL.

01:31:06.093 --> 01:31:10.698
SIR IN THE NATIONAL GUARD -- SO-I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:31:10.765 --> 01:31:11.132
THAT'S THAT'S CLEAR.

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:13.067
ENOUGH [inaudible]

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:16.370
WELL THE SENATOR -- BECAUSE

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:18.940
SOMEONE APPEARS AS A WITNESS

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:20.908
DOES NOT MEAN NECESSARILY THAT

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:22.910
THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:25.079
ADOPTS WHATEVER VIEWS WHATEVER

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:27.515
WHATEVER BEHAVIORS AND AND I

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:28.749
ASSUME YOU KNOW THAT SO.

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:31.052
SO WHAT WILL PUT THAT ASIDE.

01:31:31.118 --> 01:31:34.188
BUT THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT -- TO

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:35.456
WHETHER OR NOT THE MILITARY

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:37.558
TAKES ACTION CERTAINLY THE

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:39.393
MILITARY CAN AND SHOULD TAKE

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:42.230
ACTION ANDERSON ISSUE CONCERNING.

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:44.832
ANY SORT OF IMPROPRIETY.

01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:46.267
BUT BUT THAT DOESN'T.

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.768
THAT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE ISSUE

01:31:47.835 --> 01:31:49.971
OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN HARMED

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:52.006
<u>ND IS SEEKING REDRESS FOR THAT</u>

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:53.107
HARM.

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:56.077
SO FIRST I GET THIS DOES NOT

01:31:56.143 --> 01:31:57.345
INCLUDE MEDICAL MALPRACTICE.

01:31:57.411 --> 01:31:59.413
AND THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:00.882
ISSUE.

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:02.350
BUT WHAT THE FIRST DOCTOR IN.

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:05.119
IS IS PREMISED UPON THE MILITARY

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:06.621
BASICALLY IS IS SOVEREIGN.

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:08.990
SO WHEN SOMEONE IN THE DANIELS

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:10.424
CASE WHEN SOMEONE.

01:32:10.491 --> 01:32:12.226
DIES IN CHILDBIRTH THROUGH GROSS

01:32:12.293 --> 01:32:13.861
MALPRACTICE.

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:16.163
AND SOMEONE IS HARMED THE CHILD

01:32:16.230 --> 01:32:17.431
FOR EXAMPLES LEFT WITH A

01:32:17.498 --> 01:32:19.066
LIFELONG INJURY.

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:21.135
AND YOU CAN'T RECOVER THAT IS ON

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:22.737
JUST IN CALIFORNIA.

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:23.971
IF A WOMAN AND I'LL AND I'LL

01:32:24.038 --> 01:32:26.040
POINT TO A WOMAN IF A WOMAN HAS

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:27.341
BEEN HARM BECAUSE OF SEXUAL

01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:29.977
HARASSMENT.

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:31.746
BESIDES THE WHATEVER

01:32:31.812 --> 01:32:32.880
ADMINISTRATIVE OR CRIMINAL

01:32:32.947 --> 01:32:34.115
ACTION MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST THE

01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:35.349
PERPETRATOR.

01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:37.318
MY VIEW IS THAT WOMAN SHOULD

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:38.753
HAVE A RIGHT TO RECOVER FOR

01:32:38.819 --> 01:32:40.554
WHATEVER INJURY SHE SUSTAINED

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:42.556
IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:44.892
PERSON WHO PERPETRATED THAT.

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:47.228
WRONGDOING IS IN UNIFORM OR NOT

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:48.763
I TAKE YOUR POINT CONCERNING

01:32:48.829 --> 01:32:49.297
WHETHER THERE'S AN

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:50.731
UNSUBSTANTIATED OR SUBSTANTIATE

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:52.700
AND WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK ON

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:53.534
THAT BUT IT'S REALLY.

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:56.604
THE SORT OF APPLES AND ORANGES

01:32:56.671 --> 01:32:57.605
YEAH YES.

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:58.506
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MEDICAL

01:32:58.572 --> 01:33:00.341
MALPRACTICE IN YOUR BILL CORRECT

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:02.076
OR NOT THE END I'M I'M USING

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:02.576
THAT FOR THE LESSER CAM

01:33:02.643 --> 01:33:05.212
ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES IS

01:33:05.279 --> 01:33:05.513
[inaudible]

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:06.647
TO ARMS THAT.

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:08.049
WHEN THE FERRIES DOCTRINE IS IN

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:08.983
PLACE?

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:11.185
THAT BASICALLY PROVIDES A CLOAK

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:12.987
OF IMMUNITY FOR MANY DIFFERENT

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:15.456
HARMS AND BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA

01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:17.191

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:19.727
WHO ARE ON STATE ACTIVE DUTY

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:23.030
ACTUALLY PERFORM MEDICAL.

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:26.300
PROCEDURES AT LEAST NOT.

WE'RE GETTING OUR STATE IF THAT

01:33:27.001 --> 01:33:27.702

01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:05.232
AS I SEE IT.

01:35:05.299 --> 01:35:07.635

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:43.204
AND EVERY SOLDIER.

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:44.405
SAILOR WHOEVER THEY HAVE THE

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:46.407
OPPORTUNITY TO KNOCK ON THAT

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:48.242
DOOR AND TALK TO THE EXPECTING.

01:35:48.309 --> 01:35:50.644
TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SO WHEN

01:35:50.711 --> 01:35:53.047
THIS OPENS THE DOOR WHERE THE

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:54.949
MILITARY CAN START SUING ONE

01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:56.417
ANOTHER.

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:58.619
I I I THINK WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE

01:35:58.686 --> 01:36:03.858
WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP THIS DOOR

01:36:03.924 --> 01:36:04.458
AND WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:05.292
CLOSE.

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:06.627
AND THAT'S MY FEAR FACTOR AND

01:36:06.694 --> 01:36:08.629
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IS THERE --

01:36:08.696 --> 01:36:09.563
THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN THERE --

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:10.965
OUR PROCEDURES IN THE MILITARY

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:13.767
BEEN THERE EVER SENT TO ALL OF

01:36:13.834 --> 01:36:14.902
US WERE BORN AND IT BEFORE.

01:36:14.969 --> 01:36:17.805
SO I I'M AFRAID WITH THIS IS

01:36:17.872 --> 01:36:19.707
GOING TO DO AND A LOT OF GREAT

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.275
MEN AND WOMEN HAVE SERVED IN

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:23.410
DRAGON AND THEY'VE REPRESENTED

01:36:23.477 --> 01:36:24.345
OUR OUR SOLDIERS.

01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:28.883
WITH HONOR AND DIGNITY AND WHENTHERE IS A AN ISSUE ABOUT

01:36:28.949 --> 01:36:31.018
REPRISAL AND SO ON I THINK THE

01:36:31.085 --> 01:36:34.588
SYSTEM OVER THE YEARS THAT WE'VE

01:36:34.655 --> 01:36:36.056
ALL SURE.

01:36:36.123 --> 01:36:36.757
IT'S PROVEN RIGHT.

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:37.358
AND SO THERE MIGHT BE ISSUES

01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:39.760
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD ISSUES WITH

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:41.662
THEIR COMMANDING OFFICERS BUT

01:36:41.729 --> 01:36:44.231
THAT DOES NOT -- I BELIEVE GIVES

01:36:44.298 --> 01:36:45.933
THE RIGHT TO THE CLEAN THE THE

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.268
ENTIRE SLATE.

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:49.203
THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE IS

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:51.438
THERE FOR A REASON AND SO I'M

01:36:51.505 --> 01:36:54.308
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY THAT -- WE

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:55.943
CAN'T CHANGE THAT AND I DON'T

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:57.745
WANT TO BEGIN TO CHANGE IT SO

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:58.946
WITH THAT I'M GONNA ALLOW YOU TO

01:36:59.013 --> 01:37:02.650
CLOSE AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO

01:37:02.716 --> 01:37:03.250
AHEAD AND AND AND CALL FOR THE

01:37:03.317 --> 01:37:05.519

POSIT THAT ONE MONTH'S DEPOSIT

02:04:08.808 --> 02:04:09.708
IN MOST CASES.

02:04:09.775 --> 02:04:10.776
THAT THE IT WAS ABOUT THE

02:04:10.843 --> 02:04:13.612
RECOURSE THAT THAT OUT LANDLORDS

CONTACT THE COMMANDING OFFICER

02:04:23.088 --> 02:04:23.622
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT I HEARD

02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:26.492
THERE.

02:04:26.559 --> 02:04:27.893
IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE -- I'M

02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.228

02:05:05.698 --> 02:05:07.733
ALMOST REACHES IF IT'S SEPARATED

02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:08.968
AND SO THAT JUST BY PROXY OF

02:05:09.034 --> 02:05:09.935
BEING RELATED TO MILITARY

02:05:10.002 --> 02:05:10.936
PERSONNEL YOU COULD.

02:05:11.003 --> 02:05:12.538
APPLY TO HAVE THE REDUCTION

02:05:12.605 --> 02:05:13.339
WHETHER THEY LIVE WITH YOU OR

02:05:13.405 --> 02:05:19.478
NOT I GATHER THIS THAT THE

02:05:19.545 --> 02:05:21.547
CENTERS ATTENTION ITSELF

02:05:21.614 --> 02:05:21.847
[inaudible]

02:05:21.914 --> 02:05:24.617
CLEAR THAT.

02:05:24.683 --> 02:05:28.153
THERE WAS CHAIR.

02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:28.754
COMMON AS WELL WE WANT TO MAKE

02:05:28.821 --> 02:05:30.422
THIS IS AS A BUSINESS FRIENDLY.

02:05:30.489 --> 02:05:32.091
AS VETERAN FRIENDLY WEEKS

02:05:32.157 --> 02:05:32.458
POSSIBLY COULD.

02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:34.493
AND YOU HAD MENTIONED FIFTEEN

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:37.696
UNITS AND BELOW IS MY POP.

02:05:37.763 --> 02:05:40.099
THING -- BUT THE BILL DOES SAY

02:05:40.165 --> 02:05:41.533
EXCESSIVE -- AMOUNT OF SECURITY

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:42.101
DEPOSIT AND THAT'S THAT'S A

02:05:42.167 --> 02:05:43.102
QUESTION THAT THE MILITARY IS

02:05:43.168 --> 02:05:46.906
ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT.

02:05:46.972 --> 02:05:48.240
THAT SOMEONE.

02:05:48.307 --> 02:05:48.874
ANY LANDLORD REGARDLESS OF THE

02:05:48.941 --> 02:05:53.379
NUMBER OF UNITS -- ASK FOR A

02:05:53.445 --> 02:05:54.613
DODGE PURITY DEPOSIT THAT HIS EX

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:55.447
IN EXCESS.

02:05:55.514 --> 02:05:58.217
OF THAT'S A QUESTION IS IT ONE

02:05:58.284 --> 02:06:00.219
MONTH DID YOU FIND EXCESSIVE.

02:06:00.286 --> 02:06:02.087
WHAT WOULD BE EXCESSIVE

02:06:02.154 --> 02:06:02.388
[inaudible]

02:06:02.454 --> 02:06:04.590
AND AT SUCH A GOOD QUESTION AND

02:06:04.657 --> 02:06:05.958
THE ORIGINS OF THIS BILL CAME

02:06:06.025 --> 02:06:08.160
FROM THE COMMANDER IF THAT CAN'T

02:06:08.227 --> 02:06:09.228
PARK IN MY DISTRICT.

02:06:09.295 --> 02:06:11.063
WHO HAS THAT -- OBVIOUSLY ACTIVE

02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:12.998
DUTY MILITARY.

02:06:13.065 --> 02:06:14.400
SERVING ON HER FACE AND NECK AND

02:06:14.466 --> 02:06:15.701
AS VERY WELL AWARE OF THE

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:17.937
EXPERIENCES THEY WERE FACING IN

02:06:18.003 --> 02:06:19.071
TERMS OF THIS UPFRONT COSTS.

02:06:19.138 --> 02:06:20.306
THIS BILL REDUCES THAT

02:06:20.372 --> 02:06:22.775
OBLIGATION IN MOST CASES FROM

02:06:22.841 --> 02:06:23.309
TWO MONTHS OF THE SECURITY

02:06:23.375 --> 02:06:24.310
DEPOSIT.

02:06:24.376 --> 02:06:25.544
TO ONE SO THERE IS STILL

02:06:25.611 --> 02:06:27.079
SECURITY DEPOSIT PLACE.

02:06:27.146 --> 02:06:27.913
BUT IT'S THE SECOND MONTH IT'S

02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:30.082
CAUSING THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES --

02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:31.984
THAT THE BILL TRY SO AMENDMENT

02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:32.718
READ.

02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:34.787
THAT THAT THE DEMAND IN EXCESS

02:06:34.853 --> 02:06:39.525
OF ONE MONTH AS A DEPOSIT.

02:06:39.591 --> 02:06:40.926
THEN YOU HAVE.

02:06:40.993 --> 02:06:41.827
SOMETHING THAT'S REASONABLE

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:43.662
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT EXCEEDING.

02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:44.496
SOMEONE WERE ASKING FOR TWO OR

02:06:44.563 --> 02:06:46.398
THREE MUCH DEPOSIT AT LEAST THE

02:06:46.465 --> 02:06:48.734
LANDLORD KNOWS THAT HE HAS.

02:06:48.801 --> 02:06:50.269
THE ABILITY TO TO RECEIVE A

02:06:50.336 --> 02:06:52.204
DEPOSIT BUT NOT IN EXCESS F OF

02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:53.305
A MONTH.

02:06:53.372 --> 02:06:55.674
THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY.

02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:56.875
THE OTHER IS THE FACT THAT.

02:06:56.942 --> 02:06:59.311
THAT THE UNIT MUST BE OCCUPIED

02:06:59.378 --> 02:07:00.913
BY THE FAMILY.

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:04.116
OF THE ACTIVE DUTY MEMBER.

02:07:04.183 --> 02:07:05.751
AND ALSO THAT HE GIVES

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:09.021
PERMISSION. TO ALLOW HIS

02:07:09.088 --> 02:07:11.023
COMMANDING OFFICER TO BE

02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:11.991
NOTIFIED IN THE EVENT HE DOESN'T.

02:07:12.057 --> 02:07:12.958
PAY THE RENT.

02:07:13.025 --> 02:07:14.994
I THINK THAT WOULD.

02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:16.362
THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF SOME OF

02:07:16.428 --> 02:07:17.663
THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:19.832
SAYS.

02:07:19.898 --> 02:07:21.767
THAT IF I'M GOING TO DO THIS --

02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:23.535
WHAT WE DO FOR MAY WELL IF YOU

02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:25.371
DO THIS YOU HAVE ACCESS TO MY

02:07:25.437 --> 02:07:28.207
COMMANDING OFFICER AND IF YOU?

02:07:28.273 --> 02:07:31.310
DON'T -- REQUIRED TWO OR THREE

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:32.277
MONTHS.

02:07:32.344 --> 02:07:34.246
OF DEPOSIT THEN YOU CAN CALL MY

02:07:34.313 --> 02:07:37.149
COMMANDING OFFICER AND SHOW IN

02:07:38.851 --> 02:07:40.152
WITH WITH AN AMENDMENT THAT YOU

02:07:40.219 --> 02:07:41.253
THINK YOU CAN PUT TOGETHER ON

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.856
THAT YEAH SO I'M I AND I I I

02:07:43.922 --> 02:07:45.290
COULD CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO

02:07:45.357 --> 02:07:46.558
CLEARING UP THIS ISSUE THAT IT'S

02:07:46.625 --> 02:07:49.228
REALLY IS ABOUT THE HE OR SHE

02:07:49.294 --> 02:07:50.596
ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBER.

02:07:50.662 --> 02:07:51.797
WE'RE TRYING TO AND TAKE INTO

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:53.232
ACCOUNT THOSE WHO MAY BE LIVING

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:54.800
WITH THAT ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE

02:07:54.867 --> 02:07:56.869
NUMBER -- THE ACTIVE DUTY

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:58.704
SERVICE MEMBER AND FAMILY THAT'S

02:07:58.771 --> 02:07:59.738
RIGHT THAT THAT IS THAT'S WHAT

02:07:59.805 --> 02:08:01.073
IT SAID IT TEMPTING TO ADDRESS

02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:02.541
IF THAT'S NOT CLEAR IN TE BILL

02:08:07.246 --> 02:08:07.746
THAT YES WE ARE SPECIFICALLY

02:08:07.813 --> 02:08:08.547
ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF WHETHER

02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:10.149
OR NOT THE REQUIREMENT OF A

02:08:10.215 --> 02:08:12.451
SECOND MONTH OR THIRD MONTH IS

02:08:12.518 --> 02:08:14.019
REQUIRED WE'D LIKE IT TO BE --

02:08:21.994 --> 02:08:23.595
THE BILL AND I AND THAT GOT MY

02:08:23.662 --> 02:08:24.229
ATTENTION AND I DON'T AND I SEE

02:08:24.296 --> 02:08:24.863
THAT.

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:26.932
MA'AM IT'S IT'S RIGHT HERE AND

02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:34.540
SECURITY DEPOSIT THAT THAT

YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND ACCESS TO

02:08:36.775 --> 02:08:38.844
THE COMMANDING OFFICER IF YOU

02:08:38.911 --> 02:08:40.279
CAN MAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS.

02:08:40.345 --> 02:08:41.814
MR RESPECTFULLY ON OUR OUR BOARD

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:42.981
OF DIRECTORS LAW HAS LOOKED AT

02:08:43.048 --> 02:08:44.917
THE ISSUE VERY CAREFULLY -- THAT

02:08:44.983 --> 02:08:47.152
HAVING A SEPARATE STANDARD FOR

02:08:47.219 --> 02:08:48.187
FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL BUT

02:08:48.253 --> 02:08:49.788
PLACES ON OUR STANDARDS ON ON

02:08:49.855 --> 02:08:50.889
OUR SMALL MOM AND POPS.

02:08:50.956 --> 02:08:52.091
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:53.425
SAME KIND OF OPERATING COSTS

02:08:53.492 --> 02:08:54.059
THAT ARE LARGE PROPERTY OWNERS

02:08:54.126 --> 02:08:54.593
DO.

02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:56.061
ON WHICH IS WHY THEY'VE MADE THE

02:08:56.128 --> 02:08:57.796
CONCESSIONS THAT -- IF WE COULD

02:08:57.863 --> 02:08:59.364
REMOVE THE SMALL MOM AND POPS

02:08:59.431 --> 02:09:00.933
THE FIFTEEN UNITS UNLESS WHICH

02:09:00.999 --> 02:09:02.668
ARE NOT PROFESSIONALLY MANAGED --

02:09:02.734 --> 02:09:04.036
THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY --

02:09:04.103 --> 02:09:04.903
TOWARDS US BEING ABLE TO REMOVE

02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:06.939
OPPOSITION IN FACT IF WE WERE TO

02:09:07.005 --> 02:09:11.543
EXEMPT THOSE PROPERTIES WE COULD

02:09:11.610 --> 02:09:12.711
MOVE OPPOSITION IN ITS ENTIRETY

02:09:12.778 --> 02:09:13.011
[inaudible]

02:09:13.078 --> 02:09:13.745
YEAH.

02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:14.379
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE STILL NOT IN

02:09:14.446 --> 02:09:15.414
AGREEMENT AND AS THE OTHER

02:09:15.481 --> 02:09:16.348
WITNESS IN OPPOSITION THE BILL

02:09:16.415 --> 02:09:19.384
TESTIFIED 80% OF THEIR UNITS.

02:09:19.451 --> 02:09:20.986
OUR LOW ARE FIFTEEN UNITS -- OUR

02:09:21.053 --> 02:09:23.122
LAST SO WE HEARD THAT IT IS A

02:09:23.188 --> 02:09:24.256
LARGE PART OF THE RENTAL MARKET

02:09:24.323 --> 02:09:25.491
YEAH AND THAT'S NOT REALLY

02:09:25.557 --> 02:09:26.825
TRYING TO GET IT HELPING THE

02:09:26.892 --> 02:09:28.660
SERVICE MEMBERS THAT TERMS OF

02:09:28.727 --> 02:09:30.295
WHAT THEY TYPICALLY INDOOR --

02:09:30.362 --> 02:09:32.931
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE WE STILL

02:09:32.998 --> 02:09:33.866
NOT REALLY THE SAME PAGE ON THAT.

02:09:33.932 --> 02:09:34.867
BUT IN THE LAST POINT THAT YOU

02:09:34.933 --> 02:09:35.968
MADE ABOUT.

02:09:36.034 --> 02:09:37.569
PERMISSION -- TO CONTACT THE

02:09:37.636 --> 02:09:39.271
COMMANDING OFFICER I'M OPEN TO

02:09:39.338 --> 02:09:40.405
TO TRY TO CRAFT AMENDMENTS TO

02:09:40.472 --> 02:09:41.740
MAKE SURE THAT.

02:09:41.807 --> 02:09:43.142
THAT WOULD BE GRANTED A GOOD

02:09:43.208 --> 02:09:44.543
CASE CENTER IN THE REASON WE

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:45.577
HAVE TO MAKE THIS IS FRIENDLY AS

02:09:45.644 --> 02:09:47.846
POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE

02:09:47.913 --> 02:09:49.114
THE HOUSING.

02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:51.150
AVAILABLE TO AS MANY MILITARY

02:09:51.216 --> 02:09:53.285
PERSONNEL AS POSSIBLE.

02:09:53.352 --> 02:09:55.854
AND IF THERE'S FIVE OR SIX UNIT

02:09:55.921 --> 02:09:57.322
SOMEWHERE OR TEN OR TWELVE AND

02:09:57.389 --> 02:09:58.957
THERE'S VACANCIES WE WANT THOSE

02:09:59.024 --> 02:10:01.026
VETERANS OR NOT THE BETTER BUT

02:10:01.093 --> 02:10:02.961
THE MILITARY PERSONNEL TO HAVE A

02:10:03.028 --> 02:10:04.530
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AMONG

02:10:04.596 --> 02:10:06.865
THEMSELVES. TO GO FOR IT AND IF

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:08.634
THEY HAVE PERMISSION TO TO SEE

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:10.636
THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER THE

02:10:10.702 --> 02:10:13.005
LAND ORDER OR MANAGER ADDS THAT

02:10:13.071 --> 02:10:13.872
I THINK THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF

02:10:13.939 --> 02:10:16.141
THAT -- NOT TO EXCEED IT A

02:10:16.208 --> 02:10:19.178
MONTH'S RENT I THINK THAT TAKES

02:10:19.244 --> 02:10:21.180
CARE YOUR EXCESSIVE -- RENT THAT

02:10:21.246 --> 02:10:22.981
WOULD NORMALLY BE CHARGE AND

02:10:23.048 --> 02:10:25.117
IT'S THE FAMILY OF THE VETERANS

02:10:25.184 --> 02:10:26.919
IN THOSE THREE ITEMS AND IF YOU

02:10:26.985 --> 02:10:31.590
CAN MAKE HELL TO JUST ONCE.

02:10:31.657 --> 02:10:33.692
I THINK TWO OR THREE IS NOT BAD.

02:10:33.759 --> 02:10:34.560
THIS YEAR I THINK THAT WE CAN --

02:10:34.626 --> 02:10:36.094
MAKE THAT ACCOMMODATION -- AS

02:10:36.161 --> 02:10:36.628
YOU HAVE INDICATED.

02:10:36.695 --> 02:10:37.162
LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE

02:10:37.229 --> 02:10:37.696
ALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:38.830
REALTORS HAS INCREDIBLE

02:10:38.897 --> 02:10:40.999
PARTNERSHIP -- WITH OUR MILITARY

02:10:41.066 --> 02:10:42.734
WITH VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY

02:10:42.801 --> 02:10:43.635
SERVICE MEMBERS AND I I KNOW

02:10:43.702 --> 02:10:44.436
THAT.

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:45.571
THEY COME HERE WITH THEIR

02:10:45.637 --> 02:10:48.273
CONCERNS THAT -- DEEPLY FELT BUT

02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:50.075
NOT OUT OF ANY ANY.

02:10:50.142 --> 02:10:52.744
LACK OF WONDERFUL SUPPORT --

02:10:52.811 --> 02:10:54.246
THAT WE GET FROM OUR REALTORS

02:10:54.313 --> 02:10:55.814
LOCALLY AND CERTAINLY FROM THE

02:10:55.881 --> 02:10:57.816
STATE'S OF WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

02:10:57.883 --> 02:10:59.685
OUT THESE WILL TRY TO SEE IF WE

02:10:59.751 --> 02:11:00.285
CAN WORK OUT THESE DIFFERENCES

02:11:00.352 --> 02:11:01.853
WE DO HAVE A THE FUNDAMENTAL ONE

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:03.322
THAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO YET.

02:11:03.388 --> 02:11:04.256
BUT ON THE ONES THAT YOU'VE

02:11:04.323 --> 02:11:06.024
RAISED I THINK WE CAN FIND A

02:11:06.091 --> 02:11:07.025
COMBINATION ON I BELIEVE TALK

02:11:07.092 --> 02:11:08.193
