SO I WANT TO GREET THE CHAIR ARCHULETA AND- AND- NGUYEN AND- THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE- WELL FAMILIAR FACES HERE AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUPPORTED ME. AND THE AGENCY OVER THE YEARS SOME VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. BOB I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS CAL THAT'S TWENTY TWENTY. MASTER PLAN FOR THE VETERANS HOMES AND HOW IT'S GOING TO GAS A GUIDE CAL THAT'S PLANNING OVER COMING DETAILS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS POPULATION IS CHANGING IN SEVERAL WAYS AND THE VETERANS HOMES MUST CHANGE WITH THEM. THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTED CALVET CONDUCTED NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND A MASTER PLAN FOR THE HOMES AND WE HAVE DONE THAT. RESEARCH ON THE WRITING OF THE MASTER PLAN WAS A TREMENDOUS UNDERTAKING FOR OUR DEPARTMENT. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR SEVENTY THREE YEAR HISTORY CALVET HAS FULLY REASSESSED THE VETERANS HOME SYSTEM. INCLUDING OUR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. ARE PROGRAMS OF CARE AND THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS. CALVET STAFF COMBINED. A COMB THROUGH THOUSANDS OF RECORDS TO CAPTURE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES AMONG OUR RESIDENTS AND THEM AMONG THE VETERAN COMMUNITY AT LARGE. WE MET WITH DOZENS OF VETERANS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES LONG TERM CARE EXPERTS AS WELL AS THE ALLIED COUNCILS AND OTHER RESIDENTS AT EVERY HOME. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES TO BOLSTER OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. SALIM GRATEFUL FOR THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS WHO OFFERED THEIR VALUABLE TIME TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROJECT. THE RESULT OF WHICH IS THIS. THE MASTER PLAN DAVID TWENTY TWENTY BUT YOU KNOW THEY'LL BE AN UPDATE EVERY FIVE YEARS IN PERPETUITY I'M VERY PROUD OF THIS DOCUMENT WHAT OUR TEAM HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE MASTER PLAN THE DEPTH AND QUALITY OF THE RESEARCH PAINTS A COMPELLING PORTRAIT OF TODAY'S AND TOMORROW'S VETERANS AND WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW TO MEET FUTURE VETERANS NEEDS. HOWEVER I SHOULD MENTION THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE INCLUDING THE ASSUMPTION OF NO LARGE INCREASE IN THE VETERAN POPULATION AS WE HAVE LEARNED OVER THE PAST CENTURY EVERY NEW WAR CREATES NEW VETERANS THAT HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE IMPACT ON THE VETERAN COMMUNITY FIVE MAY PUT IT MORE BLUNTLY IF THE UNITED STATES ENGAGES IN ANY NEW MAJOR CONFLICTS OR WARS SOME OR ALL OF OUR FINDINGS MAY NEED RADICAL ECONSIDERATION. WITHOUT CABBIE OUT MIND LET ME PROCEED THE MASTER PLAN SERVES TWO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS FIRST IT IS A NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT EXAMINES TRENDS IN THE VETERANS COMMUNITY INCLUDING HOW MANY VETERANS LIVING CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY LIVE AND HOW THEIR CARE NEEDS ARE CHANGING. THIS NEEDS ASSESSMENT ALSO EVALUATES THE VETERANS HOMES THEMSELVES BY REVIEWING THE STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS AT EACH CAMPUS. SECONDLY THE MASTER PLAN IS A ROADMAP TO GUIDE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT LONG TERM CAN'T A LONG TERM PLANNING. INCLUDED IN THE PLAN ARE TWENTY SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS ON A WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS THAT WE ARE CONFIDENT WILL HELP ENSURE ON GOING SUCCESS OF ALL EIGHT OF OUR HOMES. BUT BEFORE I DISCUSS ANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS SINCE BUT IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE VETERAN POPULATION THAT WE HAVE THE HONOR TO SERVE. FOR PERHAPS FORTY YEARS IT'S WORLD WAR TWO VETERANS THAT HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES OF THE VETERAN HOME SYSTEM. SEVEN OF OUR EIGHT HOMES WERE SPECIFICALLY BUILT TO SERVE WORLD WAR TWO AND KOREA WAR VETERANS. HOWEVER WE'RE LOSING THOSE VETERANS AT A RAPID RATE. AND THIS REPRESENTS A TREMENDOUS LOSS FOR OUR STATE IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA BECAME WHAT IT IS TODAY BECAUSE OF THE GREAT INFLUX OF VETERANS RETURNING FROM WORLD WAR TWO. AND WITH THIS SAD LOSS CALIFORNIA'S VETERAN POPULATION HAS ALREADY DECREASED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND OVER THE PAST DECADE. AND TO MAKE THAT VISUAL IF YOU WOULD LOOK AT TABLE ONE IN THE HAND THAT WE PROVIDED YOU. IT'S THE DECREASING VETERAN POPULATION PROJECTED OUT TO TWO THOUSAND FORTY FIVE. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE SOURCES OF ALL THIS INFORMATION WE CAN GIVE YOU. TONS OF FOOTNOTES YOU'LL NOTICE THAT FIVE YEARS AGO- WHEN I STARTED WE WERE AT ONE POINT EIGHT. MILLION VETERANSTODAY WE ARE AT ONE POINT SIX MILLION AND THAT NUMBER IS PROJECTED TO GO DOWN. AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR I'M SAID TO SAY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PROJECTS THAT TEXAS NOT CALIFORNIA IS NOW THE STATE WITH THE LARGEST VETERAN POPULATION. THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE WELL INTO THE FUTURE AND BY THE OR FORTY FORTY THE VA PROJECTS A 40% DECLINE IN OUR VETERAN POPULATION. THIS REDUCTION IS SIGNIFICANT THERE WILL BE FAR FEWER VETERANS IN TEN TO TWENTY YEARS. BUT THIS DECREASEDOES NOT TRANSLATE INTO A PROPORTIONAL DECLINE IN THE CARE NEEDS OF VETERANS. WITH A LOSS OF WORLD WAR TWO AND KOREA WAR VETERANS COMES A GENERATIONAL SHIFT. WHICH YOU MIGHT SEE MORE EASILY IN TABLE TWO OF THE HAND OUT. TODAY THE HOMES PRIMARILY SERVE VIETNAM WAR VETERANS WITH GULF WAR VETERANS LOOMING ON THE NEAR HORIZON WE BELIEVE THAT VIETNAM AND GULF WAR VETERANS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO NEED LONG TERM CARE. AND TO ME THAT AT YOUNGER AGES. COMPARED TO WORLD WAR TWO VETERANS. VETERANS FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE A HIGH DISABILITY RATING FROM THE VA DEFINED AS GREATER THAN 70% VIETNAM AND GULF WAR VETERANS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS TO HAVE PTSD SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND MANY OTHER PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. OF ALL THE VETERANS RECEIVING IN HOME CARE 20% OF THEM SERVED AFTER NINE ELEVEN DESPITE BEING RELATIVELY YOUNG FOR DAILY CARE. THEIR CARE NEEDS ARE FAR MORE CUTE THAN THOSE OF VETERANS OF PRIOR JIM GENERATIONS. YOU CAN SEE THAT ON TABLE THREE WHERE THE GREEN LINE IS THE DECREASING POPULATION OF VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA. WHILE THE BLUE LINE IS THE INCREASING DISABILITY AMONG CALIFORNIA VETERANS. MUCH OF THIS GENERATIONAL SHIFT CAN LIKELY BE TRACED BACK TO THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE WARS THAT WE FIGHT THEMSELVES AS A RETIRED COLONEL OF THE ARMY MEDICAL CORPS WITH MULTIPLE DEPLOYMENTS I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND THAT OVER THE LAST CENTURY THE LETHALITY OF THE BATTLE FIELD HAS CHANGED AS THE NATURE OF MODERN COMBAT HAS CHANGED. VETERANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DEPLOYED MULTIPLE TIMES ANDTO BE EXPOSED EVERYWHERE TO BALLISTIC INJURIES SEEING THAT THERE IS NO LONGER A DISTINCTION BETWEEN WAR ZONES AND SAFE ZONES FOR THESE REASONS AMONG OTHERS MODERN SERVICE MEMBERS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS TO RETURN HOME WTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH LIMITATIONS. IN DEVELOPING MASTER PLAN WE NOT ONLY LOOKED AT THE VETERANS WE SERVE WE ALSO TURNED OUR ATTENTION INWARD TO THE VETERANS HOMES THAT WE OPERATE. I AM PROUD OF THE FIVE STAR CARE WE PROVIDE TO OUR TWO THOUSAND PLUS RESIDENTS. IT'S ALSO GRATIFYING THAT MORE THAN A POSITIVE OPINION OF THE PLACE THEY CALL HOME. OUR STAFF IS THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY AND IT SHOWS. HOWEVER OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT SEVERAL HOMES ARE JUST NOT IN AN IDEAL LOCATION. NOT IDEAL FOR HIRING STAFF NOT IDEAL FOR DELIVERING SERVICES OR FOR DRAWING IN VETERANS FROM THE NEARBY COMMUNITY. THIS CAUSES BY AGENCY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES OUR WEST LOS ANGELES AND YON PHIL HOMES FOR EXAMPLE ARE FAR FROM COMMUNITIES WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. RESIDENTS SAID FIVE OF OUR EIGHT HOMES HAVE TO TRAVEL BY BUS MORE THAN AN HOUR EACH WAY TO GET TO THEIR VA SPECIALTY CARE APPOINTMENTS. AND MORE THAN ARE HALF OF OUR BARSTOW HOME IS EMPTY BECAUSE OF ITS REMOTE LOCATION AND LACK OF DEMAND. THESE CHALLENGES ARE COMPOUNDED BY THE CHANGING NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS IN OUR HOMES AND FOR A MOMENT I'D LIKE TO SHIFT. TO HAVE THOMAS MARTIN THE PRIMARY AUTHOR OF THE MASTER PLAN. OUTLINED THE STRUCTURE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REPORT AND DISCUSS HOW THE CHANGE YOU RESIDENT POPULATIONS IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS. AND ALL CLOSE WHEN HE FINISHES. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER SCRETARY- SECTORS BUT ONLY ONLY BEEN ON THE JOB FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS BUT- IT SEEMS THAT REALLY PICKED IT UP AND- OVER A SHORT TIME HERE. SO AS A SECTOR MENTION CREATING THE MASTER PLAN WAS A MAJOR UNDERTAKING FOR A FORD FOR THE DEPARTMENT FOR A STAFF. OF THE REQUIRED A LOT OF COLLABORATION WITH- WITH OUR RESIDENTS- AND WITH STAKEHOLDERS- WE HELD A NUMBER OF WORKSHOPS REBT STATES- WITH- AT DOZENS OF EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS- AS OUR DIMENSION LEGISLATORS ELECTED OFFICIALS- VETERANS SERVICE- ORGANIZATIONS- AND WE ALSO MET WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED RESIDENTS. TO GET THEIR FEEDBACK ON HOMES WE ALSO- WE ALSO CONDUCTED TWO SURVEYS OF ALL THE RESIDENTS IN OUR HOMES. AT TO MAKE SURE WE REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY SAW AS THE CURRENT TRAJECTORY OF HOMES IN WTH A- WITH A FEW FELT THE AT THE FUTURE SHOULD HAVE FOR THEM. SO I THE DEVELOPING THE STRUCTURE OF THE DRUM OF THE MASTER PLAN IN THE STRUCTURE THAT IN ITS- NEAR EACH OTHER'S WHEN WE WHEN WE STARTED THE FIRST STEP. WAS UNDERSTANDING HOW MANY VETERANS WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE- WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED- WHETHER AGES WERE THAT HAVE INFORMATION ON TO GET A DEMOGRAPHIC BASS LINE JUST UNDERSTAND ON WHAT THE POPULATION IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT- AND ALSO HOW IT'S HOW IT'S GONNA BE CHANGING THE FUTURE. OF THE NEXT THING WE DID IS WE COLLECTED HEALTH DATA. FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES- TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE KERANIQUE FOR SHIFTING IN THE POPULATION ITSELF- TO SEE HOW MUCH YOU SEE IF THEY REALLY CORRELATE EACH OTHER. AND AS THE AS THE SECRETARY SAID. WE'VE WE'VE GOT A REAL INTERESTING TRY THE BETTER POPULATION. IS DECLINING- CLEARLY IT'S GOING TO CLIMB BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS- BUT- THOSE HEALTHCARE NEEDS ARE NOT DECLINING AT THE SAME RATE. I HELP HER NEED TO CONTINUE TO GROW- LIKELY DUE TO THE INCREASING ACUITY OF THE NEEDS OF VETERANS. AS WELL AS THE- THE PREVALENCE OF MULTIPLE OUTCOME OF IT CALL MORBID OR CO OCCURRING CONDITIONS. OUR WITH THIS DATA. ARE WE CAN FIX CAMPUS OTHER CARE PROVIDERS- TO FIND TO IDENTIFY WHAT OTHER SERVICES BEING PROVIDED OUT OUT FOR THE BETTER COMMUNITY. AND ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WHAT THE SHORTCOMINGS WERE WITH THE GAPS WERE. AND WHAT OUR ROLE SHOULD BE IN AN ADDRESSING THOSE SO IN THE PROCESS WE IDENTIFIED. WE DETERMINE THAT WE WERE REALLY THE ONLY MAJOR PROVIDER OF. A FACILITY BASED LONG TERM CARE. LIKELY BECAUSE OF THE- THE PROGRAMMATIC COMPLEXITY OF TRYING TO OPERATE. ON THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES AS WELL AS THE- THE HIGH COST OF SKILLED NURSING AND GENERAL. OF WE ALSO REVIEWED WORKFORCE AND RESEARCH DATA FOR EACH SHOT FOR REGION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL HYPOTHETICAL VETERANS HOMES ARE WHERE THAT WHERE THEY MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL- AND I IT WILL TRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF WHAT KIND OF LOCAL RESOURCES YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. OF FINALLY WE REVIEWED OUR OWN INTERNAL DATA ON THE HOMES- WEEK WE COLLECTED AND MANUALLY REVIEWED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND RECORDS. TO UNDERSTAND- OUR RESIDENTS DEMOGRAPHICS THE CHANGES IN THE CARE NEEDS- WHAT KIND OF DIAGNOSES THEY HAVE. A WHAT KIND OF CHALLENGES THE HOMES FACE- RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE RELATES TO WORK FORCE- THAT TYPE OF DATA TO REALLY UNDERSTAND- HOW THAT WAS GOING IMPACTS FOR THE FUTURE AND HOW WE CAN BEST PREPARE FOR IT. SO AS OUR TO MENTION SOME OF THE DATA WAS WAS REALLY EYE OPENING- LAST SUMMER- AS MUCH WE COLLECTED A NUMBER OF INTERNAL RECORDSAND THE PROCESS WE REVIEWED EVERY SINGLE RESIDENTS- MEDICAL RECORDS AT EVERY HOME. I SO WHEN WE WHEN WE DID THAT WE IDENTIFIED- WAIT WE DETERMINE THAT THE PROP ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF OUR VIETNAM WAR VETERANS CURRENTLY LIVING IN A HOMES HAVE AT LEAST ONE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AT DIAGNOSIS ABOUT TWO THIRDS COMPARED TO ONLY 40% AMONG HERBAL WERE TO RESIDENTS. I FURTHER MORE THAN 80% OF OUR VETERANS UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE HAD AT LEAST ONE DIAGNOSIS SO. TWO THIRDS OF VIETNAM VETERANS 40% OF OVER TWO BUT MORE THAN 80% OF OUR YOUNGER VETERANS UNDER SIXTY FIVE. THEY ARE BECAUSE OF THERE'S THIS GROWING NEED WE CAN SEE THIS AS THE THAT AS- KIND OF THE START OF A GROWING WAVE THAT'S GOING TO COMING TOWARDS US- WE CAN WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR MIDDLE HAS HEALTH STAFFER ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET. MEET THE DEMAND FOR SERVICES AND TO KEEP KEEP PACE WITH THE CHANGES. SIMILARLY THE DEMAND FOR SKILLED NURSING IS ALSO VERY HIGH- IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE OPEN FIVE NEW VETERANS HOMES- IN THE PROCESS WE DOUBLED OUR CAPACITY FOR SKILLED NURSING. ACROSS THE SYSTEM- DESPITE THIS WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF DEMAND AND- LEAVE THE WEIGHTLESS FOR SKILLED NURSING UNITS- COMPARATIVELY THERE'S LITTLE DEMAND FOR OUR DOMICILIARY CARE UNITS AND OUR IMMEDIATE CARE UNITS- EACH WHICH- IS. OUTDATED AND HAS SOMEWHAT LIMITED USE FOR TODAY'S VETERANS. OUR RESIDENT POPULATIONS CHANGE DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST DECADE AND WE CAN EXPECT ALL THESE TRENDS TO CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE- AND- SO FOR MORE GENERATION ABOUT THE LIVES CARE WE CORPORATE CURRENTLY PROVIDE AND THE AT THE BUDGET BETS AT EACH. ARE YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT TABLE FOUR ON PAGE TO THE HANDOUT. SO BASED ON ALL THIS INFORMATION COLLECTED- WITHIN A FIVE TWENTY SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSIDERATION. EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS SUPPORTED BY THE DATA WE COLLECTED- BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DATA AS WELL AS THE- THE WEALTH OF STAKEHOLDER INFORMATION WE- WE- WE RECEIVED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE SECRETARY TO WALK TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND HOW THEY FIT INTO OUR FUTURE. SOME OF. SO WHAT DO ALL THESE FACTS IN MIND THE MASTER PLAN OFFERS CONCRETE STEPS FOR CALIFORNIA TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE OF LONG TERM CARE VETERAN CARE WE MUST BEGIN TAILORING OUR PROGRAMS FOR VIETNAM AND GULF WAR VETERANS NOW IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT SERVICES WHEN THE TIME COMES AND TO MAXIMIZE OUR RESOURCES FOR THE BENEFITS OF ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS. SO TO START. WE RECOMMEND ELIMINATING INTERMEDIATE CARE. AS A LEVEL OF CARE. AND REDUCING DOMICILIARY CARE AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON ASSISTED LIVING AND SKILLED NURSING WHICH HAVE FAR GREATER DEMAND AND HAVE PROVEN MORE EFFECTIVE. THE LEVEL OF CARE IS THOMAS MENTIONED IS- DELINEATED ON- TABLE FOR WHICH IS THE SECOND PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT. JUST A FOOTNOTE OR IT MAY BE A PARENTHESIS- INTERMEDIATE CARE IS A DINOSAUR LEVEL OF CARE IF IT EXISTS. IN VERY VERY FEW PLACES IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE ALL RUN BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT EXISTS IN OUR VETERANS HOMES AND IN THE STATE HOSPITALS AND THAT'S IT. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AN INTERMEDIATE CARE CARE COULD EASILY UPGRADE EITHER TO A SKILLED NURSING BAD. OR MOVE DOWN DEPENDING ON HOW MANY ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH DOWN TO THE ASSISTED LIVING. WE COULD EASILY. PHASE THAT AWAY WHEN I SAY GET RID OF THAT LEVEL OF CARE I DO NOT MEAN. DISMISSING ANY SINGLE RESIDENT FROM THE HOME WHO'S IN THAT LEVEL OF CARE. THEY WOULD JUST BE ASSIGNED TO A DIFFERENT ONE. THIS YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SUBMITTED THE PCP TO DO JUST THAT STARTING THE LONG PROCESS. OF RESHAPING OUR BARSTOW CHULA VISTA AND YON PHIL HOMES BY REFOCUSING EFFORTS AND RESOURCES ON MORE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF CARE TO BE CLEAR ONCE AGAIN NO CURRENT RESIDENT OF ANY HOME WOULD BE JUST CHARGED AS PART OF ANY TRANSITION EFFORT. THE B. C. P. THAT ACCOMPANIES THE MASTER PLAN ALSO IMPROVES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFFING ACROSS THE SYSTEM ENSURING THAT OUR RESIDENTS HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS WHEN THEY NEED THEMOST. THE MASTER PLAN INCLUDES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EACH OF OUR VETERANS HOMES INCLUDING SEVERAL FOR THE YOUNG FULL CAMPUS ALONE. MOST CRITICALLY THE MASTER PLAN HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO REPLACE THEIR THE AGING HALDEMAN BUILDING WITH A NEW STATE OF THE ART SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. AND WITHOUT IT THE HOME CANNOT PROVIDE THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR COMING GENERATIONS OF VETERANS. A MASTER PLAN ALSO SUGGEST SUGGEST EXPANDING PROPERTY USE AT THE YOUNG FILL HOME TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THE LAND WITHOUT PLACING BURDENS ON THE GENERAL FUND. OF COURSE ANY SUCH PROPERTY USE HAS TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO RESIDENTS OF THE HOME BUT I BELIEVE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH THAT MEET OUR STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS WHILE ALLOWING FOR GREATER SUPPORT. OF CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS. THESE ARE ONLY A FEW OF THE TWENTY SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE MASTER PLAN BRIEFLY SOME OF THE OTHERS WOULD SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING. ONE IMPROVE COORDINATION WITH SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROGRAMS SUCH AS V. H. H. P. TO ENSURE THAT THE HOMES CAN AFFECT EFFECTIVELY SERVE HOMELESS VETERANS. THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED OF LONG TERM CARE. TO PROVIDE CLEAR CRITERIA FOR DEVELOPING ANY FUTURE VETERANS HOME TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE LOCATED IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE COMMUNITIES. LET ME MAKE SURE I'M I'M CLEAR I'M NOT PROPOSING THE CALVET START THE CONSTRUCTION OF ANY NEW VETERANS HOMES BUT IF YOU WOULD PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT ME THAT WITH ME AT TABLE FIVE. ON PAGE TWO. IT'S PROBABLY THE SINGLE MOST SLOW AT. THE SLIDE I'M I'M MOST- PROUD OF HERE. ACROSS THE TOP WHAT WHAT CREATES THE COLUMNS ARE WHAT I CALL VETOES FIVE RULES FOR FUTURE VETERAN HOME CONSTRUCTION. A BETTER A NEW VETERANS HOME MUST BE LOCATED IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S A HIGH DENSITY OF VETERANS AND THERE'S A HIGH NEED. THERE MUST BE ACROSS THE STREET FROM A VA OR IF NOT THIS CLOSE TO ONE AS YOU CAN GET. IT HAS TO OFFER APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF CARE AND THOSE LEVELS OF CARE NEED TO EXIST IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S THE FOURTH COLUMN THERE HASTO BE A LOCAL HEALTH CARE- INFRASTRUCTURE. AND FINALLY FIVE IT REALLY HELPS TO BE ABLE FOR OUR ENTRY LEVEL- A HIRING. A STAFF NURSES AND PHARMACISTS THERAPISTS EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO LIVE WITHIN A REASONABLE- LOCATION. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS THIS IS A REPORT CARD ON EVERYONE OF THE HOMES. AND YOU'LL SEE. OF WHETHER THE AT THE HOME LOCATION WAS APPROPRIATE WHEN IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OR NOT THERE'S OF THE GRADES THEY GET NOW. NUMBER THREE MAKE PERMANENT. PLEASE BUT- THE CURRENT FISCAL YEARS OPERATIONAL EXPENSE ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE THREE OLDER HOMES THOSE ARE THE ONES BILL BEFORE TWO THOUSAND. WHICH IS INCLUDED IN ANOTHER BCP CURRENTLY PENDING A REVIEW. FOR OPERATE OP EVALUATE OPTIONS TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED DEMENTIA CARE STARTING WITH THE UNIT ARE AT OUR CHULA VISTA HOME. AND FIVE REASSESS LEVELS OF CARE AT OUR FIVE NEWEST HOMES TO PROVIDE MORE EFFECTIVE SERVICES WITH- WITHIN LOCAL RESOURCES. SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT IMPLEMENTING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL MAKE SURE THE HOMES CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR DECADES TO COME. HOWEVER I KNOW I CANNOT ACT ON THESE ALONE AND I ASK FOR THE HELP OF THE LEGISLATURE THE RESIDENTS IN OUR HOMES OUR STAFF AND ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE THEM THROUGH TO FRUITION. AS I'VE MENTIONED THE LEGISLATURE NOW HAS SEVERAL BCP'S THAT WOULD ENACT SOME OF THE MOST FAR REACHING RECOMMENDATIONS OTHER BUDGET OR LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS MAY COME IN FUTURE YEARS TO FURTHER THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TO MAKE THEM COMPLY WITH OTHERS. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DEVELOPING THE MASTER PLAN AND I'M CONVINCED THAT MUST PLAY A SIMILAR ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING THAT. CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH ME WITH THE FIRST STATES TO OPEN A VETERANS HOME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN FOR A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE YEARS NOW WE HAVE REPEATEDLY MADE BOLD COMMITMENTS TO OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN ARMS. TO HOUSE THEM WHEN THEY NEED SHELTER TO EDUCATE THEM WHEN THEY NEED JOBS TO CARE FOR THEM WHEN THEY AGE. THIS MASTER PLAN REPRESENTS YET ANOTHER BOLD COMMITMENT. IN OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORTS TO BETTER HONOR CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS. WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT MANY OF OUR VETERANS NEED LONG TERM CARE. BECAUSE OF INJURIES THEY BORE WHILE WEARING OUR NATION'S UNIFORMS AND PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE OUR FREEDOMS AND OUR VALUES. IT'S UP TO US TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE CARE AND THE DIGNITY THEY HAVE EARNED. AND TO MAKE SURE OUR VETERANS HOMES CAN THRIVE FOR THE NEXT HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE YEARS. SO I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR WORK PRODUCT TO YOU. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT I THANK YOU OF VERY MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION AND- ONE OF WELCOME ALL THE SENATORS AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE TODAY THANK YOU FOR. JOINING US. AND NOW WE'RE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. DO WE HAVE. SENATOR OFF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SECRETARY GOOD TO SEE YOU. LOOKING AT THE- THE BARSTOW HOME SCORE CARD WHICH. LARGELY A SERIES OF RED AXIS DID TAKE A LOOK TO RECOMMENDATIONS. THE REPORT INDICATES THAT THERE'S A DEMAND FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY BEDS THAT OBVIOUSLY- MUST EXCEED THE CAPABILITY OF THE FACILITY- DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE- THAT THE COMMERCIAL OPERATORS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEN THE AREA ARE AND ARE NOT CAPABLE OF. ACCOMMODATING THESE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. OCCUPANTS WERE CLIENTS. I KNOW THAT- WE HAVE A DEMAND THAT BAR SO AT AS IT IN OTHER PLACES WEEK CAL THAT FOR SKILLED NURSING WE DO NOT HAVE A DEMAND FOR DOMICILIARY LEVEL CARE OR FOR INTERMEDIATE CARE THERE- ALSO. IN A AYE AYE ONLY HALF JOKINGLY SAY THAT I COULD WALK OUTSIDE THIS BUILDING ENCOUNTER HOMELESS VETERAN ON THE CAPITOL MALL OFFER HIM A PLACE TO SLEEP TONIGHT AND THREE SQUARE MEALS STARTING TOMORROW MORNING BUT I CAN'T GET THEM TO MOVE TO BARSTOW. YEAH SO I HAVE A STRUGGLE WITH WITH THAT SO THAT'S WHY ONLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF OUR HUNDRED AND HUNDRED A HUNDRED EIGHTY OF OUR FOUR HUNDRED BEDS ARE FILLED THERE YOU'RE ASKING ME TO FOR A COMMENT ON THE- LONG TERM CARE NURSING FACILITIES ANNOUNCING A MAKE MY QUESTION CLEAR I MEAN I GUESS MY QUESTION IS GIVEN THE DIFFICULTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BURST OF FACILITY. AND OUR DESIRE AS THE LEGISLATURE AND I ASSUME IS AN ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VETERANS RECEIVE ABSOLUTELY THE CARE- THAT THEY NEED AND CLEARLY DESERVE IS IT POSSIBLE IN THE COMMUNITY THEN IF WE WANTED TO DO SO BUT WHEN IT'S THERE WITH LEGISLATIVE POLITICAL WILL TO DO IT. TO TAKE THE POPULAR OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITY TODAY IN THE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ACCOMMODATE IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND THE POPULATION THAT NEEDS ASSISTED CARE WHETHER YOU CALL IT INTERMEDIATE CARE OR ASSISTED LIVING. AND MAKE THAT CARE AVAILABLE THROUGH CONTRACT FACILITIES IN THE COMMUNITY- TO SO IN SOME WAY. THAN MAY OF AT HOME. STATE FACILITY AND PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF CARE AT LOW COST OR NO COST. YEAH YES BROADLY SPEAKING PARDON ANY NEW ACCOMMODATION I THINK STILL HAS TO MEET FIVE RULES- SO. THE VERY FIRST ROLE WOULD BE IS THAT AN AREA WITH A HIGH VETERAN DENSITY THE INLAND EMPIRE HAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY DENSE- VETERAN POPULATION BUT THERE FOCUSED MORE IN THE BIGGER CITIES RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO- AT WE COULD WE COULD HAVE EASILY HYPOTHESIZE THAT WERE THERE TO BE A MOVE CAN. CONSIDER MOVE SUCH AS THAT THAT THOSE LARGER METROPOLITAN AREAS WOULD BE WHERE I WOULD GO LOOKING WELL FOR A FOR OF STATE FACILITY YEAH MY QUESTION IS YOU HAVE A CENSUS OF FORTY IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY SO THEY'RE FORTY BEDS THAT ARE OCCUPIED- DOES A LOCAL COMMUNITY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO ABSORB THE FORTY ADDITIONAL PATIENTS AND THEY DON'T FEEL WHAT YOU WOULD LOSE BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THIS THOMAS- FAIRLY ELOQUENTLY SAID EARLY ON. ON CAL THAT IS THE ONLY ENTITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT OFFERS VETERANS A LONG TERM CARE OPTION IN COMMUNITY. THERE ARE EVERY NURSING HOME IN CALIFORNIAHAS VETERANS THEY MIGHT HAVE A HUNDRED RESIDENTS WITH THE THREE OF THEM ARE VETERANS AND I DARE SAY THEY DON'T GET A SPECIAL. TREATMENT FOR THAT YOU MEAN YOU MEAN. BY A FACILITY THAT IS. INTERESTED IN PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE VETERANS WELFARE. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COST WHO PAYS EXACTLY EXACTLY WHAT IS THERE THAT'S THE INTANGIBLE BENEFIT OF RUNNING A FACILITY CREEKS AND JUST TO JUST TO KIND OF JUMP IN SO WHEN WE WHEN WE DID- WE DID OUR INTERVIEWS WITH- WITH- WITH RESIDENTS- THEY WERE COUPLE OF RESPONSES I THINK WE'RE KIND OF ON POINTS THAT NUMBER OF A RESIDENTS WERE NOT INTERESTED IN A NURSING HOME- THEY WERE INTERESTED IN VETERANS HOME THEY'RE WILLING TO GO TO VETERANS HOME BUT THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED IN. OTHER OTHER LONG TERM CARE THAT WASN'T ABOUT AND SEE IF THEY FELT THAT I MIGHT BE IN SKILLED NURSING UNIT BUT I'M NOT IN A NURSING HOME I'M IN A VETERANS HOME SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF AN ATTENTION THING THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO THEM- OTHERS HAD COME FROM A PRIVATE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES- INCLUDING- SO THE VA THE VA ANY RIGHT WHERE THE VA PROVIDES- THAT PROVIDES A SKILLED NURSING CONTRACTED OUT. TO PAY ON DISABILITY RATINGS IN THE PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM- SO NUMBER OF VETERANS DID GETS- SKILLED NURSING TO PRIVACY THAT WAS FREE FOR THEM- AND THEY STILL CAME TO US BECAUSE THEY FELT THE WORDS- THEY WEREN'T UNDERSTOOD OR THEY THEY WEREN'T. THEY FELT THEY'D- DIDN'T BLAND. WITH THE PRIVATE. POPULATION AND ONE LAST QUESTION DO WE KNOW WHETHER FOR EXAMPLE YOUR CENSUS OF FORTY IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO IS THE- AS TO THE AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT. THOSE FORTY INDIVIDUALS WERE CAME TO US FROM THE BARSTOW AREA OR DID THEY COME TO US FROM. GEOGRAPHICALLY REMOTE LOCATIONS DO WE KNOW THAT SO AT SO- WE DID WE DID CANVAS THE RESIDENTS TO FIND OUT WHERE EXACTLY THEY CAME FROM- LOS RESIDENTES CAME FROM WITH A HUNDRED MILES THAT'S THAT'S GENERALLY ACROSS ALL IT COMES. ON THE CAME WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES FOR SKILLED NURSING AND FOR ASSISTED LIVING AND PRIMARILY INDEPENDENT LIVING MAINLY WITHIN FIFTY MILES OR LESS- IN LOOKING A BAR STONE PARTICULAR THAT THE BOOK OF THEM AB CAME FROM. LOOKED AT BURNSIDE SALMON DINO MUCH PERSONAL METROPOLITAN AREA TO BARSTOW TO BURST RIGHT WITHOUT IT IS NOT VERY MANY WHO CAME FROM THE IMMEDIATE. AREA WILL GIVE YOU OPTIONS TO IN ORDER TO KEEP THE VETERANS POPULATION HAPPY THEY'RE DRIVING OR- COMING. COME TO BARS SO FROM SOME PLACE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATE UMBERG. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR WORKING ISING THIS HEARING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT I THINK HASN'T BEEN- GIVEN ENOUGH AWARENESS IN THE LEGISLATURE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR REAPPOINTMENT MISTER SECRETARY AND- CONGRATULATIONS TO YOUR STAFF AYE AYES SUSPECTED THEY ACTUALLY HELP YOU WRITE THIS REPORT THAT ARE- THIS IS QUITE COMPREHENSIVE AND ALSO HAS BEEN COMPREHENSIVE THERE ARE SOME VERY CRITICAL ELEMENTS IN THE REPORT LEAST PORTIONS THAT THAT I'VE READ IN AND I COMMEND YOU FOR BEING WHAT APPEARS TO BE VERY OBJECTIVE IN YOUR ASSESSMENT OF. WHERE THE HOMES APART I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS LET ME ASK A FEW AND THEN PERHAPS TURN OVER TO OTHER MEMBERS FOR THE THEIR QUESTION- SO I SEE ON PAGE FIVE OF THE REPORTS IS NEARLY 85% OF THE WAIT LIST OF APPLICANTS REQUET SKILLED NURSING OR MEMORY KERR SO THAT WOULD INDICATE TO ME THAT THAT WE'VE GOT OUR FACILITY. ARE NOT A WITH THE MAN IS THAT HOW YOU AS WELL ABSOLUTELY JOB FOR EXAMPLE IT DOWN FILL THIS LONG WAITING LISTS FOR THOSE OF HIGHER TWO LEVELS OF CARE ZERO WAITING LIST FOR YEARS FOR DOMICILIARY. THEN PERHAPS IT'S IN THE REPORT BUT BUT HOW MANY OF THE HOME PROVIDE MEMORY CARE. TODAY I THE YOUNG FILL WEST LOS ANGELES READING AND FRESNO- VETERANS HOMES SO FORTY FOUR OF THE EIGHT FOR THE SIDE. MEMORY KERR- IN WHAT'S WHAT'S BEING DONE TO EXPAND IT TO ALL LATER OR BE ON THOSE FOR- WE'RE STARTING WITH A REQUEST WILL BE WITH THE PCC AND DRY CHICKEN. SINCE I GOT HERE I'VE HEARD- FROM CHULA VISTA AREA OF COMMUNITY THERE'S A NEED FOR DEMENTIA CARE THERE AND THIS IS MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT. IN IS THAT ALL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. YOU SAID AS A B. C. P. THERE IS THAT ALSO PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SORRY I THINK I THINK THE SECTOR AREA COMPUTER THING SO I'M NOT THAT ONE'S NOT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR THAT IS SOMETHING WE WANT EXPLORE FOR THE FUTURE WHETHER IT'S- YOU KNOW WHETHER TO THE BUDGET PROCESS OR- TO SOME OTHER METHOD. THE FIRST WE NEED DO IS EVALUATE THE EXISTING FACILITY- TO DETERMINE WHAT CAN BE HOW CAN BE MODIFIED TO ACCOMMODATE AB OR CARE SO WE REALLY SEE IT AS A HUGE BLACK HOLE BECAUSE- THE CITY GO POPULOUS CAN OVER. LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND FOR YEARS OF. ON THE COME THE- OF BETTER LOOKS BETTER DENSE BUT THE NEAREST NOW THAN YOUR STANDARD SO WITH MEMBER CARE IS IN WEST LOS. YOU KNOW TO NOT HOURS AWAY TO LIVE IN SAN DIEGO MAYBE MORE SO RELEASE THAT SOME WE NEED TO START LOOKING FOR THE FUTURE SO POTENTIALLY WE WOULD WE WOULD MODIFY EXIST SKINNER. IS PROVIDE THAT. OKAY BUT BUT BACK TO THE MONEY SURE IT THIS IS THE. CURRENT BUDGET THE. HOWEVER IT DOWN IN THE IN THE CURRENT BUDGET THERE ARE. THERE IS A BEAST HE- AT ATTACHED TO THE MASTER PLAN- THAT LOOKS AT REALIGNING LEVELS OF CARE SO FOR EXAMPLE- AS AN RAFI MENTIONED YEAH THERE'S HIGH DEMAND FOR SKILLED NURSING IN BARSTOW- BUT THAT AT THE- AT THE HOME RIGHT NOW SO WE'RE- ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO. TO EXPAND THE SKILLED NURSING WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY- CONVERTING A DRAWING DOWN THE INDEPENDENT IN AN IMMEDIATE CARE UNIT SO. SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING KIND OF STRATEGICALLY AT HOW CAN WE CHANGE THOSE LEVELS OF KERR- START CHANGING NOW TO MEET THE DEMAND THAT AVERY SAYING AND BE THAT WE THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE IN THE NEXT TEN OR TWENTY YEARS. UPSET WE ARE STARTING THE PROCESS WITH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THIS I'M SORRY I DID COME A WRECK. WITH THE RECENT. SORRY ABOUT THAT. OKAY AND MAYBE ALL LINE WE CAN MEET TALK ABOUT. WHAT WHAT ADDITIONAL FOR OR WHAT FUNDS CURRENTLY IN THE BUDGET TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT YOU SET OUT AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU YOU'VE SET OUT HERE- YOU ALSO ON ON PAGE FOUR- YOU YOU TALK ABOUT HOW- VIETNAM VETS AND POST VIETNAM VETS. HAVE A HIGHER NEED FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AS OPPOSED TO WERE WERE TO INCREASE IN MORE VETS AND DISK. AS TO WHAT WHAT THE- BECAUSE FACTORS ARE. WHERE TO START OF WORLD WAR TWO VETERANS WENT OFF WANTS TO WAR CAME BACK AND- THE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE KIND OF BALLISTIC INJURIES OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN UNIFORM A SMALLER PROPORTION WERE EXPOSED IN THAT WAY- CURRENT CONFLICT VETERANS ARE GOING OFF REPETITIVELY FOUR YEAR LONG ROTATIONS- THEY'RE IN CONSTANT EXPOSURE TO AYE EDIE'S AND ROCKETS MORTARS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. IT'S THE INJURIES TO THE BRAIN SO I JOKE. THAT WHEN THE NAM WHEN WE WAR TWO QUE TO THE VETERANS HOMES THEY CAME TO A SUDDEN OLDER GE WITH TWO SUITCASES AND TWO DIAGNOSES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE GLAUCOMA. JUST GENERIC FOR EASY TO TREAT THINGS NOW OUR SOLDIERS ARE COMING BACK WITH. MULTIPLE DIAGNOSIS FROM THE COLLAR BONE UP MORE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE EXACERBATING THEIR UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR ON MENTAL HEALTH THINGS OF PTSD- SO. THAT'S THAT'S THE START OF IT. THE START OF THE IT IT'S HARD FROM TO READ BUT BUT I READ THE PRESIDENT I'D STATES OF JUST JUST SAID THAT AS TO THE THIRTY FOR THE OF THOSE SOLDIERS THEY WERE INJURED THAT THEY JUST HAVE MINOR HEADACHES AND THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL. SO I YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED TO COMMENT I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THAT PATH BUT WE MIGHT SEE SOME OF THOSE THIRTY FOUR. NO DOUBT NO DOUBT- I ALSO KNOW ON PAGE NINETY ONE- IT SAYS CALIFORNIA IS EIGHT POINT 3% OF THE NATION'S TOTAL VETERAN POPULATION BUT 29% OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS VETERANS WHAT WHY IS THAT AT WELL THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND 52% OF THE NATION'S ON SHELTERED VETERANS. TO MAKE IT WORSE THERE ARE NO HOMELESS VETERANS IN NORTH DAKOTA NORTHERN VERMONT NORTHERN MAINE. FOR OBVIOUS REASONS- OTHER STATES IN THE LAST THREE YEARS- I'M TAKING A VIRGINIA CONNECTICUT AND MAYBE RHODE ISLAND SOLVED PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THEY SOLVE THEIR VETERAN HOME HOUSING HOMELESSNESS SITUATION. BECAUSE CONNECTICUT HAD. THREE HUNDRED. THREE AND WE HAVE LAST COUNT LIVE IN SOUTH BECAUSE- VETERANS. YOU THINK THERE. TO MOVING TOWARDS CLIMATE CONDITIONS SCARY STITCH. AND THAT WE- MENTION TODAY AND I HAVE. EXT FOR IS THAT WHILE THE VETERANS OF CURRENT CONFLICTS THEIR DISABILITY RATE IS GOING UP AS THE GENERAL POPULATION GOES DOWN. CALIFORNIA VETERANS ARE MORE DISABLED THAN THE VETERANS OF ANY OTHER STATE. WAS IT BECAUSE OF SOME I DON'T SOMEONE HERE IN FOR A MEETING. OF JUST I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY MICRO. OR AYE I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT. LASKO UP OVER THE IN PREP SO CAN COME BACK A LITTLE LATER ON IS THAT WE HAVE A BAY. HOME YOU YOU LOOK AT THE DIAGRAM AND YOU WONDER. WHY WE HAVE HOMES IN CERTAIN PLACES WHERE WE DO HAVE HOMES. OF ANY IN YOU MENTION CRY TO YOUR FOR NEW HOMES- AND ALSO THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IN BARSTOW. FILLING BEDS BECAUSE OF THE- MANY ISSUES SURROUNDING BARS THE WHAT WHAT DO YOU TH ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR LOCATION HERE FOR A FOR A NEW HOME. NO I'M NOT AT THE- SURE GOES BACK TO IF I CAN USE THE ANALOGY TO A MONOPOLY BOARD IF I COULD BE. ALL THE HOTELS AND HOUSES ON CLEAN. NOW NO AS YON PHIL. WAS BILL A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO SO THAT CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE A- HUMANE WAY OF TREATING THE VETERANS OF THE CIVIL WAR. THEY BOTTOM SEVEN HUNDRED ACRES OUT THERE IT WAS A WORKING FARM THEY ALL WENT UP THERE AND THEY WEREN'T ON THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO. WITH THEIR HATS IN THEIR HAND ONCE WE COME THE EXPRESSION HANDICAPPED BY THE WAY- YEAH. THE MADE SENSE THEN. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE- OF CALIFORNIA TODAY WITH OUR POPULATION CENTERS WHERE THEY ARE AND WHERE OUR VETERANS. POPULATIONS ARE THE BAY AREA- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN LA COUNTY THE INLAND EMPIRE AROUND- MARCH AIR FORCE BASE. AND SAN DIEGO THE NAVY PRESENTS. IT I WISH I COULD JUST PLUG THEM UP FOR WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT PUT. RIGHT SUMMER BILL RELATIVE LAST YEARS BUT WHAT WHAT THE YOUNG THE I. FELLOW. I WOULD MAKE SENSE TO CAN MOVING THAT BUT BECAUSE- THE REPLACE. BUILDING OF THE THREE OLDEST BUILDINGS THERE IS THE NUMBER ONE ON THE NATIONAL V. A.'S. NEEDS LIST CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER ONE TO HAVE THOSE THREE BUILDINGS REPLACED- IF THEY'RE GONNA GIVE US A SUBSTANTIAL. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BUILD A NEW NURSING STATE OF THE ART FACILITY THERE. THERE ISN'T ANY WAY I CAN ABANDON SO FOR. EMOTIONAL REASONS HISTORICAL REASONS AND IF THERE'S A ANCIENT CEMETERY ON THAT PROPERTY I DON'T THINK WE'RE EVER GOING EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T MEET ANY MY CRITERIA. RIGHT WE'RE NOT GONNA THAT CAMPUS WE COULD YOU. RIGHT TO CAN RE LOW. WHY ARE STILL. A BAR SO OR ARE I SAY IF WHAT IF THE FED Vì ã. WANTS MY HOME AT THE WAY A WESTELL CAMPUS TO ALLOW THEM CREATE THEIR MASTER PLAN ALL OF THAT. IF THEY MAKE THE OLYMPIAN EQUAL FACILITY IN THE FERNANDO VALLEY UP AND SUPPORT THE AREA. IT WILL I WOULD TAKE IT IN HIGH BECAUSE IT WAS MY EMPLOYMENT I KNOW I AM GET THE WHOLE IS A- THEY DO NOT MEET YOUR- SO THAT THE QUESTION IS. ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT OTHER LOCATIONS FOR THEIR NEW HOMES OR RELOCATING SOME LISTING ON SU THEIR LOCATION AND IF. OUR WHAT. SO YOU THINK IN A THANK. IF I. GET MOVES ARE SO MY WITH IT UP IN. THE CITY IT ASIDE. SOLVE ALL MY- IN A BEATS OFF CONCURS THAT. THE. S. THANK YOU AND YOU ACTUALLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD BECAUSE I KNOW IN PAST HEARINGS WE'VE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THE WAIT LIST. AND THE WAIT LIST FOR SKILLED NURSING. RIGHT AND YOU KNOW AND THEN THIS REPORT YOU TALK ABOUT HOW. THE NUMBER OF VETERANS ACTUALLY DECREASING BUT THEN WE HAVE EIGHT HOMES BUT THEY'RE NOT ALL BEING. ALSO USED AT PEAK EFFICIENCY I GUESS IS A NICE WAY TO SAY IT. SUCH WATER CAN YOU COMMENT ON. THE WAIT LIST THE NEEDS AND HOW WE'RE ADDRESSING THAT IN THE MASTER PLAN AND- AND MAYBE YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF LEADS TO WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO RELOCATE OR- YOU HOMES. FOR JUST COMMENT ON TAT SERVICE COUPLE TIME YOU'RE CHIME IN TO SERVE. THE POPULATION IS GOING DOWN. BUT THEY'RE JUST A- RAY ARE GOING UP THE CROSS THIS AND- SHE- WHICH- LOOKING AT THE NEW. THAT WE- THE NEED THAT I SEE COMING IS FORCED NURSING ASSISTED LIVING MUCH NURSING AND MEMORY. WE DON'T THOSE OTHER TO LOVE OF CARE ANYMORE ONLY X. OF SIR NUMBER OF OUR HOMES WE CAN THESE FACED OUT. OF THE FOR WE WOULD LOSE WITH THE LOSS OF A DOMICILIARY WAS A TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS A DAY FORTY DOLLARS A DAY IF COULD COMES NO WHERE NEAR THE COST OF CARE. IF WE STARTED PRIVATIZING AS WE DID WITH LEGISLATION THAT YOU HELPED US WITH A FEW YEARS AGO. PRIORITIZING VETERANS WITH GREATER THAN 70% DISABILITY THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT MORRISON COVERS OUR COST OF CARE THIS IS HOW NEW YORK STATE MAKES A PROFIT ON ITS BETTER HOMES. IN WHAT WE ONLY RECOUP. THIRTY FOUR FORTY FOR SINCE THAT OF OUR COST OF CARE. SO IT WOULD INTERSECTING LINE GOING ON I'M AT THE LEVELS OF. I SEE THAT WE'VE GOT TOO MANY OF A KIND BAD WE DO NEED NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO A TSUNAMI IS GOING TO HIT US IN TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS WHEN. WHEN VIDAK VETERANS OF CURRENT CONFLICT COM AT US WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES AND ALL THE EFFECTS OF THE BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. US THAT THEY SUFFERED BY EXPOSURE OF THEIR BRAINS TO THE MODERN BATTLEFIELD AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO WE'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE ENOUGH BEDS NEVER NEVER NEVER BUT I WANT TO DO THE BEST I CAN WITH WHAT YOU GIVE ME. I HAD THE ONE AT THE HOUSE ACTUALLY. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING ELSE CAN SAY. AND OF. I'D JUST BY TO GO BACK YOU BRIEF MEN THE HOW AND HOME PRO AND HOW DO THAT WORK YOU YOUR TALKING YOU'RE PLANNED ELIMINATE DA A CARE THAT IS A PROGRAM YOU WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE HOMELESS A CRISIS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA VH H. P. HAS DONE A LOT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VETS AND THAT IS THE ONLY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS ACTUALLY DECREASING AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. HELLO THOMAS CARE. HOW DOES VH H. P. FIT INTO THAT AND BUT I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT THE NORTH DAKOTA HAS ZERO HOMELESS HAD THAT THAT'S- BECAUSE THEY REALLY WILD THE WEATHER IS TERRIBLE THERE. BUT WE DO HAVE A COUNTY HERE THAT HAS WHAT THEY CALL FUNCTIONALLY ZERO HOMELESS VETS AND PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE H. H. P. AND THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE AND I KNOW I WAS AT A HEARING IN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF PETRIE-NORRIS IS. AND THERE WERE ON TO HOME VETS ALL SO. IT IS CONCERNED THAT I DON'T SEE AT THAT MUCH- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S INTEREST RIGHT NOW IN OF AND CONTINUING THE V. H. H. P. PROGRAM CONTINUING TO FUND BECAUSE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RUNNING SHORT. SO I'M GONNA PASS SISTER FOR TOO MUCH INTEREST SAY THAT WE PRESENTED YOU TODAY A MASTER PLAN ON THE VETERANS HOMES AND NOT THE ENTIRE CONTINUITY CONTINUAL OF CARE- FROM EMERGING KERR TRANSITIONAL SUPPORT OF. THROUGH OUR FARM AND HOME OWNERS. PROGRAM SO IF YOU. AVAILABLE ON SURE SO YOU KNOW SORRY I AM DEFINITELY A HUGE. OF EACH BE AMIDST BOUNCE A WAS SOMETHING ELSE TERRIBLY FAMILIAR WITH WE STARTED TO THIS. CA YOU KNOW WE GET IN ABOUT IN WE'RE BOTH ON THAT COMES. UP BUT YOU KNOW IN IN A WITH. VETERANS SERVICE OR INS CHINS BEING WITH VH STAY GETTING ABOUT SENSE OF THE THIS. THAT ARE YEAH REALLY. THAT THAT REALLY THE- POLICE SEE IT CAN THE PAST THE BEST TOOL WE IN OUR TO FOR DEALING HOME THERE. A THAT IS IT'S CAN ADD TO STAY BETWEEN WHAT. BY UP THE INDEPENDENT LIVING THE VETERANS HOMES FOR SO. ARE DONE LEARY PRO. WET LIKE THE SECTOR MENTIONS REALLY DOES. FOR PEOPLE. PRETTY MUCH NO NEEDS IT'S JEFF. IT JUST ROOM IN HERE'S THE APARTMENT. AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT HOW VH PEAS OPERATES SO CAN FEATURES PEAS ARE FOCUSED ON OBVIOUSLY THEY THERE'S A HOUSING COMPONENT THEY THEY WANNA MAKE SURE THEY HAVE- AT HAVE THE PROGRAM HOUSING SECURE HOUSING. BUT ALSO THEY MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND- A SUBSIDIES- PROGRAMS AS A NEED IT'S- COUNT JOB COUNSELLING EVERS ALL SORTS OF OTHER SERVICES- THAT ARE NOT REALLY PART OF HOW THAT THE DINOSAURS OPERATE. BUT THE OTHER KEY PART TO IT UNDER THE KEY PART IS THE LOCATION SO THE VETERANS HOME TO HAVE DOMICILIARY. ON THE OTHER ONES WITH NO DEMAND ON THOSE ARE THE YON PHIL AND- BARSTOW HOMES. THOSE HOMES LIKELY NOT VERY CONDUCIVE TO TRYING TO OPERATE A HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS SUPPORT PROGRAM BECAUSE A THERE'S NOT A LOT HOMELESS VETERANS IN THAT AREA- THEY DON'T SEEM TO MIGRATE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE OF THE HIGH DESERT OR OR- OR WINE COUNTRY- BUT ALSO. AS BE THAT THE OTHER SUPPORTING MISTER I THE GENERAL PREVENTER SO WHAT. THERE WITH A YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND. IT'S KIND OF THE END OF EITHER SIR I GUESS YOU KNOW THE COME THE VETERANS HOME. THE INTO THE DUMBEST. GENERALLY THEY'LL THEY'LL KIND OF STAY IN THE FOR THE THEIR LIFE A THEY MIGHT WORK TO HAVE TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE. AND RESERVATIONS P. A BIG PART OF THE V. H. P. IS TO. IS TO GET THEM THOSE ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND HELP THEM. GET A JOB WE INTEGRATE- THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO IT'S BATES MEANT MORE TO BE A- YEAH. SHORT TERM I GUESS. AND THIS OPERATE PHRASING BUT- YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY TO HELP THEM I REALLY GAINED. IN THE COMMUNITY SO. AND I'M SAYING A LOT THINGS YOU OBVIOUSLY ALREADY NOW BUT AT THE HELM. BUT HOPEFULLY THAT KIND OF MAKES CLEAR THERE'S THERE IS A DISTINCTION THE POPULATION SERVE SO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DOMICILIARY. IN IN THE NURSING HOME JUMPER BARSTOW. GENERALLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DOMICILIARY. DON'T QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY HAVE CARE NEEDS THAT A MORE SIGNIFICANT- OR THEY NEED THIS OTHER SERVICES. AND THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD QUALIFY. WE DON'T HAVE NEEDS ARE GENERALLY NOT APPLYING THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED SO THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING SO THERE'S NO A WHOLE LOT OF OVERLAP THAT WE SEE BETWEEN THOSE TWO POPULATIONS. RIGHT AND THEN- AS YOU MOVE TOWARD I MEAN POTENTIALLY MOVE TOWARD THESE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE OR MORE- BEDS FOR- MEMORY CARE. OF DO YOU SEE THE TOTAL NUMBER AND- THE ELIMINATING SLOWLY- DOMICILIARY. DO YOU SEE THE NUMBER OF TOTAL THAT'S GOING DOWN AT THE FACILITIES. PROBABLY PROBABLY BUT THE BEDS THAT WERE LEUCINE ONCE AGAIN ARE ONES THAT GIVE US VERY LITTLE AND FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT. AND THOSE PEOPLE CAN IF YOU IF YOU'LL CONSIDER THE V. H. H. P. HOMELESS UP POPULATION AND THE- LONG TERM CARE THAT WE PROVIDE OUR HOMES AS VENN DIAGRAMS THERE'S AN OVERLAP. AND WE'RE ABLE BY A WARM HAND OFF PROCESS TO TAKE THOSE FEW PEOPLE IN THE V. H. H. P. PROGRAMS WHO THEN REQUIRE LONG TERM CARE IN NURSING HOMES WE CAN TAKE THE MAN NOT EVERYBODY BY FAR IN AND OUR VH H. P. HOUSING NEEDS LONG TERM CARE. RIGHT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS AND THEN I WILL TURN IT BACK OVER HIS SENATOR ARCH LET OF YOU KNOW I JUST OKAY OKAY AND JUST PICKING UP ON ON THAT QUESTION IN TERMS OF THAT WHETHER OR NOT E FORECAST NUMBER OF PETS TO GO DOWN AND YOU SAID PROBABLY I'M JUST IN THE EMPLOYEES AT PICKING UP ON AT THE CHAIRS QUESTION AROUND WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD EXPECT THE NUMBER OF BEDS TO GO DOWN YOUR ANSWER IS PROBABLY. SU I'M LOOKING AT PAGE NINETY FOUR IN YOUR SUMMARY SO THAT THESE PRODUCTION SAY THAT THE ODD NUMBER OF. RESIDENTIAL CARE BEDS ARE PROJECTED TO GO DOWN FROM THIRTY THREE THOUSAND TODAY TO NINETEEN THOUSAND AND TWENTY FORTY. AND THAT NURSING HOME CARE IS EXPECTED TO GO DOWN FROM FOURTEEN THOUSAND TODAY. TO EIGHT THOUSAND AND TWENTY FORTY. ARE THESE IS IN MY READING THESE NUMBERS CORRECTLY ARE THESE ARE PROJECTIONS FOR THE NUMBER OF BEDS THAT WE NEED TO PLAN FOR OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS SO- THIS THIS WAS DEVELOPED AS IT SO THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF LIMITATIONS IN VETERAN SPECIFIC DATA- AND WHAT WE IDENTIFY WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THE IN. THE AT ALL CHAPTER FOUR IS ABOUT HIS UNDERSTANDING THAT- YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T TAKE A NON VETERAN. OF A CERTAIN AGE CERTAIN GENEROUS CETERA AND TAKE A VETERAN WITH ALL THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS AND ASSUME THAT THE CARE NEEDS ARE SIMILAR- SO THIS DATA THAT'S ON HERE- THIS IS A- IN MY OPINION VERY LOW ESTIMATE- IS SUING THAT'S- IF VETERANS HAD THE SAME. CARE NEEDS AS NON VETERANS THIS WOULD BE THE FLOOR THIS WE HOW MANY- VETERANS WHO EXPECT ME CARE. ON THE RALLY IS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE A VETERANS HAVE GREATER CARE NEEDS IN GENERAL MORE LIKELY NEED LONG TERM CARE THAT THEY'RE TRUE NUMBERS PROBABLY HIGHER THAN IT. IS OUTSIDE THEIR TABLE THAT HAS THOSE PROJECTIONS SOMEWHERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC PROJECTS ON THE AND THAT'S THAT THAT SPEAKS TO THE LIMITATIONS ON GETTING VETERAN SPECIFIC LONG TERM CAREDATA. I'M SO AGAIN WE CAN RECOGNIZE THAT SAYS THIS IS A MINIMUM- IT'S GOING TO BE SOME NUMBER HIGHER THAN THIS- BUT EITHER WAY IF YOU LOOK AT NINETEEN THOUSAND HOW MANY RESIDENTS CARE TWENTY FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND NAY OF NON OF NURSING HOME CARE AND TWENTY FORTY- CONCERN WILL HAVE TWENTY THREE HUNDRED- AT TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY BEDS OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO COME EIGHT- ALL THESE VETERANS REGARDLESS SO THAT THE REALITY IS WHAT WE'VE- AS SACRAMENTO WERE WERE HOPING TO DO IS. SHIFT OUR FOCUS SHIP THE RESOURCES MAKE SURE WE'RE WERE WERE USED FOR USING THE RESOURCES THE BEST CAN AND FOLK. ON A ON VETERANS. PROBABLY JUST TO GET THEM A- WHICH IS ALMOST. DOES THIS TIE SEARCH CAN. GETTING I'M IN THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE WE PRIORITIZE PREVIOUS YEARS WITH ALLEGE. ASSISTANCE OKAY AND THEN. I WON THING I WOULD FIND HELPFUL MIGHT ARE EXIST IS SOME KIND OF ROUGH. PROJECTION OF A YOU THINK KIND OF THE DEMAND REALLY IS GOING TO BE OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT. TEN YEARS AND THEN YOU GIVEN THE RESOURCES WE HAVE HOW MUCH OF THAT DEMAND YOU ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE. TO MEET BECAUSE I THINK UNDERSTANDING. THAT DISCONNECT AND NOT. HOW BIG THAT FUNDING SHORTFALL IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE AS WE THINK ABOUT PLANNING FOR THE NEXT. TEN TWENTY YEARS. RIGHT US SENATOR ARCH LETTER YOU HAD A QUESTION YES. ONE OF MY. SITE VISITS THAT I'VE GOT PLAN IS TO GO WITH THE SECRETARY TO BARSTOW AND TAKE A LOOK I WAS THERE- THEIR YOUNG SHOWS YOU KNOW BUT WHEN YOU MENTION THE NUMBER OF BEDS THAT ARE EMPTY AT BARSTOW I THINK- THE GENERAL PUBLIC THE PERCEPTION IS IF THERE'S AN EMPTY BED ANYWHERE. THAT A VETERAN CAN COME TO- AND WE HAVE THAT BAD AND IT SHAME ON US IF WE'RE NOT FEELING SO MY CONCERN ABOUT IS AN OUTREACH PROGRAM I MEAN IF YOU WENT OUT THERE ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES OR WHOEVER THE STAFF AND SAID WE'RE GOING TO FILL. BARSTOW I MEAN WHAT I MEAN YOU MENTIONED HOW MANY BEDS ARE EMPTY. THREE HUNDRED TO A ABOUT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED. TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED ON BUDGETED AND THEN- AD BUT TOTAL COULDN'T BUDGE ON BUDGET AND JUST VACANT BEDS IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY OR SO WELL ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY BEDS. THAT THAT POINT IT RIGHT YES WHEN RIGHT NOW IF YOU TALK TO THE AVERAGE. A PERSON IN THE STREET- WHEN YOU INTERVIEW AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABUT. THE SITUATION ABOUT HOMELESS VETERANS AND THEY SAY THAT. IT'S JUST A SHAME AT THE WE AS A COUNTRY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF VETERANS OR WE'VE GOT. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EMPTY BEDS SO I I'M ASKING YOU TO LAY OUT IF YOU CAN SOME OUTREACH PROGRAMS EITHER GET VETERANS. THAT ARE WAITING AND SOME OF THE OTHER COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE OR ACTUALLY WORK WITH THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. DO SOMETHING WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING PRO ACTIVELY. TO FILL THESE BEDS IN THE AND I JUST THINK THAT- WE JUST DESPERATELY NEED TO DO THAT. THE OTHER THING I DO. AGREE WITH YOU THAT. OBTAINING PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS SOCIAL WORKERS THAT ARE NEEDED NOT JUST THAT IN BARSTOW BUT ACROSS TE BOARD. IS STOLEN AN IMPORTANT. AND I DID LEARN THIS SAID AT YON PHIL. THAT THE WORK FORCE IS SO FAR OUT THAT IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO BRING A MAN. QUALITY IN THE- WITH THE TRAINING AND SKILL. TO WORK AT THE FACILITY I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU MAY HAVE THAT SAME PROBLEM. THERE IN BARSTOW BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO OFFSET IT YOU NEED TO COME TO US. SO WE CAN GO TO THE GOVERNOR AND EVERYWHERE ELSE. IF IT'S IF IT'S A LACK OF PAY. IF THAT'S WHAT MIGHT BE IN IT IT WAS A SITUATION. COULD IT BE HOUSING SHOULD WE BE BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE PROPERTY. THERE IN YONGE FILLED THEIR IN BARSTOW SO WE CAN HAVE THESE PROFESSIONALS. NOT ONLY WORK AT THE FACILITY BUT LIVE NEAR THE- LAKE. SO GIVE ME SOME IDEA WOULD YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH THIS. THE PERSON. WHO GO SO AT WELL FIRST OFF SO WE DO HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT- ABOUT AT A YOUNG FROM BARSTOW HOMES- SO IT'S A SPEAKING TO YOU MENTION FOR A HOUSING OUT FOR THAT IS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE TRY TO FIND A WAY TO BRING IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE CAMPUS ON WHICH WOULD BE A BENEFIT FOR STAFF- BENEFITS FOR RESIDENTS AND BENEFIT FOR THE COMMUNITY IN GENERAL SITE IS SOMETHING THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- IT'S ON TGS IS- LIST OF STATE PROPERTIES THAT THAT COULD BE- IDEAL FOR A FULL HOUSING SO OBVIOUSLY. THE DETAILS WITH YOUR TO THAT PROCESS BUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S A SPECIFIC- ITEM THAT WE REALLY THINK IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LONG TERM FUTURE THE CAMPUS. THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IS A MAJOR. IT'S GONNA BE A MAJOR CHALLENGE. IN PERPETUITY- SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN. PROVIDE ON SITE HOUSING- AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ON THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE AND IT'S ALSO A MAJOR ISSUE DURING AN EMERGENCY IF WE ARE TO HAVE STAFF THERE- THAT'S- REALLY BEEN. A HUGE HELP TO US IN THE LAST NAM. OF LAST YEAR'S AND CELEBRITIES WITHOUT SOIT IS IT IS A MAJOR ISSUE- IN ON ON THE WAGES- AND NOT IT'S PROBABLY NOT ANSWER. FOLKS LIKE TO HEAR BUT- WE DO HAVE LIMITATIONS ON WHAT WE CAN DISCUSS RELATED LABOR AND BARGAINING ON THOSE TYPES OF THINGS- BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- IN. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING INTERNALLY A KIND WHATEVER WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE. SO YOU KNOW BUT I DO WANT TO SAY. YOU KNOW WE HAVE. WE HAVE REALLY REALLY GOOD STAFF ANY OF THEM ARE STILL I THINK. I THINK GIVEN THE- YOU KNOW GIVEN GIVEN THE CHALLENGES GIVEN HOW FAR SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO WORKERS SOME LIMITATIONS- IT IS. YOUR IT IS REALLY HARD TO RECRUIT FOR A LOT OF POSITIONS. BUT A HAND YOU KNOW SOME THE PAPER TRUTH. THE REALLY REALLY AMAZING THEY'RE IN THERE FOR THE LONG HAUL- IN BOTH HOMES ARE THERE FIVE STAR FACILITIES RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD TEAM TO. DO THAT SO YOU KNOW WE ARE. WE CAN CERTAINLY IMPROVE THAT PROCESS I THINK THERE'S SOME OPTIONS LIKE SOMEONE BEING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ON THE APPLE CAMPUS AND IF YOU WOULD PLEASE OF LET ME FOLLOW UP WITH THIS WALK US THROUGH THE ELIGIBILITY. OF A VETERAN TO GET INTO OUR ONE OF OUR HOMES- I UNDERSTAND THAT IF THERE WAS A VETERAN WHO SEEKING- TO LIVE AT ONE OF THE HOMES WHATEVER DO YOU NEED TO RUN HIM THROUGH THE VA SYSTEM. SO THEY CAN BE CHANNELED. TO US WITH THE STATE OR CAN WE EVALUATE THEM OURSELVES. A YES SO WE CAN WE CAN EVALUATE THEM SO OUR SELVES- UNIT. RIGHT MY DEFINITE OVER ONE MY NAME IS BETH WYSHYNSKI AN ASSISTANT DEPUTY SECRETARY OF VETERANS HOMES I CALVET- WE HAVE- SPELLED OUT IN STE IN MILITARY VETERANS CODE WITH ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE AND- THERE THAT THE PERSON BE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT- THAT THEY HAVE BY A- SERVE IN THE- IN THE- IN THE MILITARY AND DISCHARGED UNDER- CONDITIONS OTHER THAN DISHONORABLE. THAN AND THAT THEY BE ELIGIBLE FOR. CARE THROUGH THE VA THAT WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME LIVING IN A OF THE A PROGRAM IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE WONDERING ABOUT AND THEN COME TO US AND THROUGH THAT ROUTE. THEY JUST HAVE TO BE ELIGIBLE THAT THE VA HAS TO CERTIFY THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE CARE IN STATE VETERANS HOME AS PART OF THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE. WITH THE VA WHERE THEY PROVIDE CERTAIN TYPES OF CARE ACUTE CARE TO THE CLINICS AND SOME DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROGRAMMING AND SPECIALTY CARE. AND THEN WE PROVIDE THE LONG TERM CARE WITH THEM WITH THEIR SUPPORT YOUR MOM PRETTY YEMEN. AND IN OTHER WAYS- SO THEY THEY DO HAVE TO MEET THE ELIGIBILITY AS FAR AS THE VA IS CONCERNED AND THERE AREN'T THEIR DEFINITION AND THEIR PROGRAMMING. BUT IT'S JUST A- IT'S A MATTER OF THEM VALUE WAITING IN AND AGREED TO THAT AND THE PERSON BEING AND ROLLED DOWN THROUGH THAT PROCESS IT'S NOT A LENGTHY STAY IN A VA PROGRAM THE CIRCLE I JUST WANTED TO BE PUT ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW THAT. WE APPRECIATE YOUR WORK WHICH SECTARIANS AFTER NO DOUBT BUT I GUESS IT'S THE ANXIETY THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE IN EVERYONE OF OUR DISTRICTS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US. AND WHEN WE GO BACK THE FIRST THING THAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO THE HOMELESS AND WHEN THERE'S VETERANS OUT RIGHT OUTSIDE HIS DOOR. THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY IF BUT WOULD I FIND PLACE WHETHER BEYONCE WILL A WEATHERED IN BARS. I WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK AT IT SO I THINK THE PUBLIC TIONS PROGRAM TO YOU MIGHT HAVE THE OUR- PRO MIGHT. YEAH THE RELEASE IT UP BECAUSE- WE'VE GOT AN ANSWER TO A KIDS TO. YOU NEED AN- TO VETERAN SHOW CAN GET OFF THE STREET. AND GET HELP AS YOU KNOW. I BELIEVE THERE'S ELLA. TO THE OMELESS. ONE OF COURSE ONE OF THE JUST LOST HER JOB AND- AND THEY HAVE ISSUES AT WORK OR HOME- THE OTHER. IS THE ONE WHO IS REALLY TRULY MENTALLY ILL WHO NEEDS HELP. AND THE LAST ONE WAS PUTTING SOMETHING IN THEIR VEINS AND DRINKING AND SO ON. AND THAT ONE MAY NOT FIT FOR US. BUT CERTAINLY THE VETERANS WHO. HAVE PTSD WHO- JUST. NEED THAT HELP DESPERATELY WE'VE GOT TO FIND A MAN GET TO BUT- A LOT OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID POINTS TO THE SUCCESS OF THE- OF THE V. H. H. P. PROGRAM. THEY SHOULD. DEPARTMENT LET ME JUST A LITTLE BIT TO THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF SECRET SAUCE IN THE SUCCESS OF THAT VETERANS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION PROGRAM WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH IT WE'VE HAD FOR PHASES WE'VE GIVEN OUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTRACTS ON AVERAGE EACH YEAR WE JUST PUT OUT THE FIFTH NO FOR RESULTS WILL START COMING IN THIS YEAR WE SPENT THREE HUNDRED OF THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION WITH THAT MONEY WE HAVE BUILT. ALL OVER THE STATE I WANT TO SAY IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTY BUT ALL OVER THE STATE- WE BUILT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED UNITS FOR HOMELESS VETERANS AND WHEN THAT PROGRAMMING SAUCE IT'S FUNDS- IT WE WILL HAVE BUILT CLOSE TO FIVE THOUSAND UNITS PART OF THE SECRET SAUCE WE'LL OF SPEND SIX HUNDRED MILLION TO DATE. HAVING SPENT. THREE HUNDRED MILLION WE HAVE BROUGHT IN. BY TAPPING INTO FEDERAL STATE COMMUNITY MONIES FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WENT TO THE CONSTRUCTION. EVERYONE OF THESE PROGRAMS HAS EITHER CLOSE TO IT OR ON SITE. A CASE MANAGER WHY ARE THOSE VETERANS HOMELESS FOR ALL THE REASONS YOU JUST MENTIONED SENATOR. THERE SOMEBODY THERE TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR JOBTRAINING IF THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED. THEIR SUBSTANCE ABUSE THEIR FINANCIAL LITERACY WHAT JOB TRENT WHATEVER IT IS THAT CAUSE THEM TO BE HOMELESS. IT'S ALL TIED UP INTO THAT PROGRAM. IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL I THINK THAT THAT WILL PROBABLY GO. THE VHS PER WILL GO FARTHER IN HELPING THAT POPULATION THAN THE VETERANS HOMES WILL. CHIU THANK AND MY QUESTION ALL RIGHT AND THEN WE HAVE OF A OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL FOLLOWED BY AS A SENATOR ROTH. SO. MADAM CHAIR MR SENATOR CHAIR NEVER QUITE SURE HOW TO ADDRESS THE SENATOR AND HIS CARE YEAH CULTURE. ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA PUT MY VETERANS HAD ON. DID TOWARDS VIETNAM I WAS A PROFESSIONAL TARGET. NO BIG HERO PROFESSIONAL TARGET SO. MISTER SECRETARY. I'VE READ IN DEPTH YOUR REPORT IT IS 85% PERFECT OKAY YOU DIDN'T GET 15% BECAUSE I DIDN'T THANK YOU FOUNDED. I MEAN YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF A GIGANTIC WEIRDO MACHINE THAT RUNS ON ITS OWN AND YOU'RE LIKE THE- INCHING CAR THIRD JENNY ENDS THAT ARE RIDING ELEPHANTS. AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ELEPHANTS GONNA DO. NO NEED TO REPLY THIS IS RHETORICAL OKAY THANK GOD SO. I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE RIDING THE ELEPHANT OF EVOLUTION WE STARTED OUT JUST SIMPLY TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF CIVIL WAR VETERANS. YOU HIT THAT SPOT ON. SO NOW WE HAVE EIGHT VETERANS HOMES IN CALIFORNIA OF WITH SUMMER BEING USED SUMMER NOT. WE HAVE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND I MAY BE WRONG EXACTLY BUT LIKE A THIRD OF THE- HEADS ARE. WITH HOMELESS VETERANS ECCENTRIC. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. FROM A VETERAN VIEWPOINT THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE BRAIN INJURIES THE ALZHEIMER'S AND THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE THERE. THE HOMELESS WE GRANDFATHER GRANDMOTHER IN TRYING TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT HERE. IN AND SWITCHED TO THE ONES THAT ARE- SEVERELY INJURED. AFGHANISTAN AND I ROCKY VETERANS HAVE A 20% HIGHER CHANCE OF DEVELOPING ALZHEIMER'S THAN US VIETNAM VETERANS WHOA THAT'S RIGHT. SO. AS A VETERAN I HAVE TO QUESTION BECAUSE I'M AN ANALYTICAL NERD I MEAN HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE A RULER IN THEIR POCKET. SHOULD WE BE IN THE BUSINESS OF VETERANS HOMES AND THINGS NO THAT'S GUTSY TO SAY BECAUSE I WOULD ALIENATE EVERY VETERAN THEN I KNOW. SO WE HAVE TO AND YOU'VE DONE A WONDERFUL ANALYSIS OF THIS. SO EVERYTHING IS EVOLUTIONARY IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD WE- DO IT EVOLUTION TO NOT PROVIDE BEDS TO THE HOMELESS. AND GO TO WHAT BEDS WE HAVE. FOR THE BRAIN INJURED AND THE DISABLED. OKAY. AND YOU YOU HAVE PUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. PARDON ME I'M REALLY IN THE ELEPHANTS YOU KNOW. THAT IS. THAT IS A HIDDEN JOKE MADAM. MR SENATOR. SO BUT THE POINT I'M MAKING IS. FROM MY NUMBERS AND WHAT I UNDERSTAND AND ANYONE CAN GOOGLE BEING CALIFORNIA PROVIDES MORE VETERANS BENEFITS IN OUR HOMES I THINK IT'S AROUND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION IS THAT CORRECT MISTER SECRETARY. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT'S MORE THAN FORTY SEVEN OTHER STATES COMBINED. SO MUCH THERE'S NO QUESTION THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS VETERANS BUT IT'S HOW WE SUPPORT THEM IN THIS REPORT. IS SPOT ON. 87% MY OPINION IT'S GREAT SO WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS WE HAVE ONE POINT SEVEN A ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION VETERANS WE HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF BEDS IN THE VETERANS HOMES FOR WHATEVER REASON. AND BASICALLY WERE RUNNING A LOTTERY FOR VETERANS MAN IF YOU HIT THE LOTTERY YOU GET IN A WHAT A DEAL. SOME. ANOTHER THING THIS. COMMITTEE NEEDS TO CONSIDER IS HOW DO WE- REQUIRE WAR. ADMIT VETERANS TO OUR VETERANS HOMES NOW I STRONGLY RECOMMEND ONCE AGAIN AND I'M IN DEEP TROUBLE HERE I'M IN DEEP DEEP TROUBLE FROM THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN. OTHER VETERANS COMMUNITIES. ISN'T IT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR VETERANS BECAUSE WHEN I WENT TO VIETNAM. GUESS WHO SENT ME WAS IN CALIFORNIA. JUST THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER I AB IF I IF I MAY YES SIR YEAH YOU YOU YOU NEVER REALLY ASKED ME A QUESTION BUT YOU CREATED THIS THE SENSE OF FOUR FIVE QUESTIONS IF I COULD ROLL THEM ALL UP INTO A OF A STATEMENT FIRST SO I'M GONNA SALUTE YOU AS A BROWN WATER IS I UNDERSTAND YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE IN VIETNAM AS A BROWN WATER NAVY PERSONNEL- AYE AYE SHORT TIME BROWN WATER A LONG TIME. BLUE WATER BUT I GOT SHOT AT IN BOTH AREAS I'M VERY HAPPY THAT THE EXTENDED. IT'S BROWN WATER. WELL WHAT YOU. FIRST OF ALL WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF OUR VETERANS BUT WE MUST IF WE ARE TO HONOR ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S PLEDGE THAT- TO CUT TO THE LAST SENTENCE THAT WE WILL- TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO HAVE BORNE THE BATTLE AND FOR THEIR WIDOWS AND THE ORPHANS. AND SO I DON'T THINK. GIVEN THAT THE STATES ARE OVERFLOWED THE STATE HOMES ARE AN OVERFLOW FROM THE VA SYSTEM. IT'S LIKE THE SEVENTH LEVEL OF CARE IF YOU WILL. THE CEMETERIES OF THE STATE RUNS ARE OVER FLOWS FROM THE FEDERALS THE CEMETERIES THERE IN PLACES WITH THE FEDS ARE NOT ABLE TO GO WE TAKE UP THAT BURDEN. THE STATES HAVE ALWAYS DONE THAT SINCE ABRAHAM LINCOLN- MANDATED THE STATE'S TO THAT- CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY WILL NEVER BE THE FIRST STATE TO GO BACK ON THAT PROMISE. AND BECAUSE PEOPLE DO ASK THE QUESTION WHY ARE WE IN THE BUSINESS WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF RUNNING THE VETERANS HOMES BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE CAN DO IT. AND IT'S A JOB THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WILL ALWAYS NEED TO BE DONE AS LONG AS WE HAVE VETERANS. WILK WITH YOUR GUIDANCE. A TO DO. THAT TO QUESTION EVERYTHING I'VE SAID ALWAYS AND TO ALWAYS LOOK TO DO BETTER WITH WHAT YOU GIVE US TO DO. I AM NOTE. THAT THE NUMBERS THAT ARE COMING OUT US WILL BE. ASTOUNDING WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT. BUT WE DON'T NEED TO TREAT EVERY VETERAN IN OUR VETERANS HOME. THERE ONE POINT SIX MILLION VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA I CAN TELL YOU. THAT ONE POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE ARE CALLING ME UP LOOKING FOR BAD. MANY PEOPLE WHO NEED A BETTER WHO ARE VETERANS ARE STAYING WITH A FAMILY WITH THEIR SPOUSE WITH THEIR CHILDREN TO OUR COMMUNITIES WITH A THE TENDONS AND IN HOME HEALTHCARE AND ALL THE PROGRAMS THE VA SUPPORT AND THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT. THE STRUCTURE IS THERE CALVET ITS JOB IS TO MAKE EVERYBODY HOLD HANDS TOGETHER. TO CREATE A WEB OR BETTER YET A HAMMOCK BUT NO ONE FALLS THROUGH. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- VERY ONE LAST OKAY BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PANEL. YES PLEASE. SO THE OTHER THING HERE AND WOMEN YOU CAN READ THROUGH. HAVE ABOUT 22% HIGHER. SUICIDE RATE THE MALE VETERANS SO PERHAPS THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD LOOK INTO THAT AS WELL AND I'M DONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL I'M WORRIED NOW I'M GOING TO FINISH WITH- SENATOR BROCK. THE SUN ULTRA BE QUICK UP IN LET ME ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MONEY AND THEN A QUESTION ABOUT THE DOMICILIARY REST RESIDENTS IN TERMS OF THE MONEY BEING A BUDGET GUY HOW DOES THE HOW DOES THE MONEY FLOW WITH RESPECT TO THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IS THAT A HUNDRED PERCENT- REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR SOMETHING LESS. SEVEN SEVEN HUNDRED- PRESCRIPTION. I DON'T HAVE TO THE DOLLAR BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT- IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT WHAT WE WHAT WE GET REIMBURSED VERSES WITH THE STATE'S INVESTMENTS AND THAT PROCESS OKAY WELL AS YOU KNOW THE- GIVEN YOUR POSITION- WITH YOU KNOW WITH REGARD TO THE BUDGET- THE PROCESS IS THAT WE GET OUR FUNDING UP FOR I GUESS FOR ANYONE WHO ISN'T A WHERE WE GET OUR FUNDING UP FRONT- AND THEN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WE COLLECT A VARIETY OF A REVENUES SOURCES AND WE- GIVE THAT BACK TO THE STATE TO OFFSET AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND IT'S A WIDE RANGE OF- OF REVENUE STREAMS I COULD. GO INTO IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE BUT I WON'T FOR NOW IN THE INTEREST OF TIME BUT- AS FOR ONE OF THEM IS TO BE A PER DIEM HELLO I THANK I HOPE I'M ANSWER QUESTION ONE IS THAT RIGHT NOT JUST TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT THE UN REIMBURSED PORTION ON ON THE STATE GENERAL FUND IS WITH RESPECT TO THE SNIFF. BED WELL I THINK IS. ON WHO. IN IT IF WE HAVE- VETERAN IN IN SKILLED NURSING WHO IS IT HAS A SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY RATING OF HIGHER PER DIEM. FROM THE VA THAN A SKILLED NURSING THAT WITH THE SERVICE CONNECTED. SAID SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY RATING OF LOWER THAN THAT- LOWER IT SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY GIVE OR TAKE- THE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIVE DOLLARS A DAY DEPENDS ON WHERE. WOULD WHERE IN THE STATE THEY LIVE- SO THE- UNREIMBURSED COSTS. WOULD DEPEND ON WHETHER THE- VA IS GIVING US THAT HIGHER PER DIEM. FOR THAT PERSON OR NOT. PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE VA IS THAT IF THEY GIVE US THE HIGH IF WE'RE GETTING THE HIGHER PER DIEM. FOR A RESIDENT. THAT THE VA IS INTENT AND IS THAT THAT. COVERS ALL OF THEIR CARE SO WE DON'T CHARGE THEM MEMBER FEET. DON'T COLLECTED. THE OTHER REVENUE SOURCES FOR THAT PERSON BECAUSE- THAT IS INTENDED TO BE THE- THE ENTIRE COST OF THEIR CARE WHICH- IT IS- IT DOES COVER OUR COSTS. OFTEN THE FOR THE OTHER RESIDENTS THERE IS. A DELTA THERE. AND OF COURSE IT DEPENDS- ALMOST PERSON A PERSON BECAUSE- PEOPLE'S MEMBER FEES ARE AS YOU KNOW ARE BASED ON THEIR INCOME AS OPPOSED TO- WELL. IN STATUS BASED ON THEIR INCOME THEIR CARE COST GROWTH ARE BASED ON A RATE IN AND WHAT THEY'RE GETTING IN THE WAY OF CARE. BUT THERE MEMBER THE BASED ON. ON THEIR INCOME SO. AND OF COURSE THE REIMBURSEMENTS ARE BASED ON WHAT. THAT CARE THEY'RE BEING PROVIDED SO THERE IS. A DELTA BUT IT'S NOT IN. A SET. THAT I COULD STATE FOR YOU BECAUSE IT DEPENDS SYSTEM VETERANS PAY TO. BE IN THE SNOW IF. YES AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE- INTERIM. K. OR THE. ASSISTED LIVING MISSION. SO REMEMBER THE FABRIC. OR IS THAT MEMBER PAID. BOTH WE GET ALL OF THOSE REVENUE SOURCE FOR ANYONE WHO IS NOT IN SKILL NURSING AND SAID. PER OR HIGHER THEIR SERVICE CONNECT DISABILITY RATING. I TRIED FOR ALL OF CARE WE WERE. FEE A PER DIEM. IT'S SHE'S IT'S THE F. DEPENDING ON THE SCENARIO ON THE LEVEL OF CARE TO DIFFERENT AMOUNTS. EVERYONE GETS AT LEAST SOME PER DIEM. NOW WITH RESPECT TO VETERANS WHO WERE IN THE IN THE ROOMS THE DOMICILIARY COMPONENT OF YOUR HOME OPERATION. I THINK I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY WE GET ABOUT FORTY DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PER INDIVIDUAL. WHO'S IN A ROOM. TO THE TO THE VETERANS PAY TO. LIVE IN THE FACILITY. THE RATES ARE SET BY THE MILITARY VETERANS CODE A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THEIR- INCOME. NOT THEIR ASSETS OR THEIR WEALTH. THEIR INCOME OKAY AND I'VE HEARD SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT HOMELESS DO WE KNOW WHAT OUR DEMOGRAPHIC IS ARE THESE REALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE OR THESE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO LIVE IN OUR VETERANS FACILITY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE AROUND OTHER VETERANS. OR FOR SOME OTHER NINE. HOUSING NEED RELATED CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG 25% OF ALL THE ADMISSIONS THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE HOMES ARE HOMELESS. THEY DO NOT HAVE. AN ABILITY SOME OF THEM TO PAY THE COST OF THEIR CARE. OKAY AND THEN GIVEN THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD IN THIS ORDER CENTER I'M SORRY ALSO THE FIRES THAT BURNED UP NORTH BURNED A LOT OF OUR MORTGAGE SHE'S OUT AND SOME OF THEM. WE MADE WHOLE AGAIN OTHERS WE TOOK INTO THE HOME RIGHT. AND I'VE CERTAINLY QUESTION IN THE PAST DURING MY ALMOST EIGHT YEARS HERE ABOUT WHY WE. PROVIDE A ROOMING SERVICE FOR VETERANS I UNDERSTAND IN THE DESERT DESIRE FOR VETERANS TO BE AROUND OTHER VETERANS AND I THINK THAT'S A VALUABLE REASON TO DO CONTINUING TO DO WHAT WE DO WE JUST NEED TO REALIZE WHAT IT IS BUT GIVEN THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD UP HERE RECENTLY OVER THE PAST YEAR OR MORE ABOUT HOUSING IN THE ADEQUACY OF THE HOUSING SUPPLY AND IN SOME CASES THE- LACK OF ADEQUATE HOUSING. ACROSS THE BOARD. ELIMINATING DHAMMA CELERY BEDS. CAUSES ME SOME CONCERN. HOW HOW MUCH OF A VOUCHER WOULD WE NEED TO PROVIDE AS A STATE TO VETERANS IF WE CHOSE TO GO IN TERMS OF DOLLARS AND WOOD GIVEN WHAT IT COST TO HOUSE THE VETERAN IN REVISED BAKER NO ONE'S GOING TO BE ASKED TO LEAVE AND BE GIVEN A VOUCHER TOLD TO LEAVE THAT THE PEOPLE OF HER DOMICILIARY SHOULD THEY EVEN LIVE FORTY MORE YEARS THEY'LL CONTINUE TO STAY AT THE HOME SO JUST PROGRESS TO HIGHER LEVELS OF KERR BUT WE'RE ELIMINATING BEDS. I WON'T ELIMINATING BEDS BUT IF YOU'LL SEE WITH THIS YEAR'S B. C. P. AND IDEALLY IN FUTURES I'M I'M HOPING TO LOG ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF CARE WELL I'M JUST TRYING TO GET TO THE NUMBER DID YOU ALL DO THE ANALYSIS WHAT SORT OF VOUCHERS IS WOULD WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT. IT HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR VETERANS SHOULD WE CHOOSE TO DO SO WHO OTHER WHAT LIVE IN OUR THE SILVERY BED ONE AND TWO. IS AN ADEQUATE HOUSING SUPPLY GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE SPEND ON THE MYSTERY BEDS PER OCCUPANT. TO ALLOW CUBANS TO. SIX HOUSING IN THE IN THE SO COMMUNITY WELL MAKES IS THAT A FOR NINE SO AND WE DIDN'T A SPECIFIC OF IN WHAT WOULD TAKE I GUESS TO. AT TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW TO OFFER THEM HOUSING ELSEWHERE- WE DID REVIEW OTHER PROGRAMS US OFFICE AND AS YOU KNOW THE VA OPERATES THE VAST PROGRAM. RUN NUMBER OTHER SERVICES LIKE THAT- SO WE EVALUATED THOUGH SO I GUESS I GUESS THE BEST ENSURING THAT WOULD BE WE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDING WITH THEIR WITH THEIR SHORTCOMINGS ARE. AND WHAT MIGHT RELATE TO THE DOES A POPULATION BUT AGAIN EVEN IF SAID THAT THE REALITIES AS WE COULD WE COULD. WE COULD NOT ELIMINATED SINGLE DUMP WE COULD WE GET THE DONS AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. M. AT THE BUDGET LEVELS INTO PERPETUITY- BUT THE REALITY IS WE HAVE. WE WILL INVADE A HUNDRED FIFTEEN BED THE COUPLE YEARS AGO FOR YOU OFFER TO GIVE EVERYONE PRIVATE ROOMS- AND DESPITE LIMITED HOW TO FIFTEEN WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY OR SEVENTY. SIX RIGHT. ARE STILL OTHER. THIRTY THE- SO. THE E. IF WE DON'T CHANGE THE NUMBER BUDGET BEDS ARE LIMITED WE IF WE KEEP THEM AS THEY ARE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE DOMICILIARY WON'T GO AWAY ON ITS OWN. WELL AT. THE POINT IN TIME WHERE YOU START TO MAKE DECISIONS ON WHETHER TO RELOCATE HOMES. AS YOU MOVE OUT OF THE VA OBLIGATION PERIOD AND YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. YOU WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION. BECAUSE YOU HAVE DOUBLE CELERY BEDS TODAY IN THE QUESTION IS DO YOU REPLICATE THOSE BEDS WHEN YOU GO TO THE NEW LOCATION. OR DO YOU SHIFT TO A VOUCHER SYSTEM. SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDED TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. TO AFFORD VETERANS THE OPPORTUNITY. WITH ASSISTANCE TO LIVE IN A- PARTICULAR SIEVE BUT FACILITY IN THE CIVILIAN COMMUNITY SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KNOW THAT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR COST IS. WHAT IT WOULD COST TO PROVIDE A VOUCHER AND WHAT THE AVAILABILITY OF. OF ADEQUATE HOUSING IS IN A PARTICULAR AREA AND LOS ANGELES WOULD BE DEVASTATING. RIVERSIDE SABATINO PERHAPS NOT SO MUCH FRESNO MERCED MAY BE BETTER SO IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT FACILITY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT SO THAT'S THE REASON FOR MY QUESTION. I WANT TO BELABOR THIS WILL HAVE THIS CONVERSATION I'M SURE AT SOME FUTURE POINT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I APOLOGIZE- CERTAINLY BUT NOW WE HAVE SENATOR UMBERG WHO HAS A ONE QUICK QUESTION. THAT I APOLOGIZE I HAVE THIS STUFF OUT FOR A FEW MOMENTS- SO YOU EARLIER BEFORE I LET YOU SAID THERE THAT BAR SO AS FOUR HUNDRED BEDS RIGHT. AND THE- TOTAL TOTAL FOR FOUR AND HOW MANY ARE OCCUPIED. SO THERE THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED TOTAL POTENTIAL BEDS OF THE POTENTIAL BUT RIGHT SO- AND THAT'S WHAT IS CONSTRUCTED BOARDS CONSTRUCTED BE A FOUR HUNDRED BED FACILITY. I'M RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ONLY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THAT ARE BUDGETED. SO THERE'S A HUNDRED EIGHTY BEDS THAT ARE AN BUDGETED- THAT HYPOTHETICALLY THAT SO COULD HAVE THAT IF WE GAVE IT WENT OVER ROOM HAS THE CAPACITY IF WE INCREASE RIGHT AND FAMILY OCCUPIED RIGHT NOW AND SO I THE TWENTY TWENTY THERE'S ABOUT. A HUNDRED EIGHTY OR SO THAT ARE OCCUPIED SO MOST VACANCIES IN THE DOWN PROGRAM OKAY WELL ON OFF LINE WE COULD ADDRESS SIR. OTHER ISSUES CONCERNING BUS STOP OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU LADIES GERMAN NOW WILL GO ON TO THE SECOND. PART OF OUR PANEL DISCUSSION AND- MISTER SECRETARY LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR APPEARING WITH YOUR- WITH YOUR TEAM. AS YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THIS- WITHOUT YOU. BECAUSE YOU ARE THE LEADER. THAT WE LOOK UP TO. AND WE KNOW YOU DON'T DO THIS ALONE AND- YOUR PARTNERSHIP. WITH ALL THE OTHER- FACILITIES AGENCIES AND SHOW ONE. OF AYE AYE YOUR TO DO AN OUTSTANDING JOB ONCE AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS. SO NOW MY QUESTION IS DO WE HAVE THE SECOND. GROUP ARE THEY HERE THANK YOU AND THAT WOULD BE JACK CLEAN- BUT CHERYL IN AT ETHAN. RADIC AND CHUCK HELP GET. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE SO WE'LL GO ON- WITH THEIR SECOND HALF OF THE PANEL DISCUSSION SHOW. SURE YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU ALL OF MY ART I HAVEN'T BROUGHT SEE A LITTLE STATE ANALYST OFF WOULD YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF PLEASE YEAH JACQUELINE BRAZIL LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE GREAT TO BE HERE. I'M MAINLY WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE A BACKGROUND TO WHAT LED UP TO THE CREATION OF THE MASTER PLAN AND REALLY HIGHLIGHTING THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE- TO THE CREATION OF THE MASTER PLAN. I'M SO TODAY MY COMMENTS WILL MAINLY FOCUS ON EXPLAINING THE VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS- THAT. HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO ONE ASSESS WHETHER THE CURRENT ARRAY OF SERVICES PROVIDED IN THE STATE. ARE ADEQUATE ENOUGH TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF. FRIENDS I'M IN THE FUTURE. AND HOW THAT FIT INTO THAN THIS CONCEPTION OF A MASTER PLAN AND THEN I'LL END MY COMMENTS BY JUST RAISING KEY QUESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER AS THEIR PROCESSING THE FINDINGS IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE MASTER PLAN. I WILL NOTE I MEAN IT'S A THREE HUNDRED PAGE DOCUMENT. GEN TEND THERE'S ANOTHER THINK. ALSO TAKING UP SOME OF MY WORKLOAD SO I'M TRYING MY BEST AND WE'RETRYING OUR BEST TO ANALYZE THE SPECIFIC CONTENT OF THE MASTER PLAN AND HOPEFULLY- SOON WILL BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE MORE ANALYTICAL COMMENTS ON THE PEACE BUT FOR NOW PROVIDING SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS TO HELP THE MEMBER STATE A STE. WHAT WAS PRESENT AT OKAY THANK YOU SO I'LL JUST START OFF FIRST- BY STATING THAT AS A PART OF THOSE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUDGET OUR OFFICE WE WERE DIRECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THE EXISTING LANDSCAPE OF VETERAN SERVICES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IDENTIFY POSSIBLE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY TO VETERANS. I'M SOME OF THE MAIN TAKEAWAYS FROM OUR REPORT INCLUDE THAT ONE CAL THAT IS JUST ONE OF MANY SERVICE PROVIDERS TO VETERANS. AND SOME SERVICE PROVIDERS- OPERATE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL LOCAL LEVEL WHILE OTHERS ARE NON PROFITS. ADDITIONALLY SOME SERVICE PROVIDERS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON VETERANS LIKE THE VA SYSTEM WHILE OTHERS VETERANS IS JUST ONE. POPULATION THAT THEY SERVE- WITHIN THE THEIR THEIR BROADER- ELIGIBILITY POOL. TO THEIR AND ARE NOW OF A LEAST OF A HOME THERE PENT UP DEMAND AT CERTAIN LEVELS OF I THINK YOU YOU HEARD THAT THAT REALLY IS IN THE SKILLED NURSING AND- MEMORY CARE BEDS. THIRD CALVET ADMIN ARE NOW SAYS A WHILE THERE ARE BETTER SITUATED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CERTAIN VETERANS THERE WAS- WE- IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH CAL THAT THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT THEY DID HAVE LIMITED CAPACITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF VETERANS WITH COMPLEX HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND GIVEN THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THAT AND IT VETERANS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS A COULD APPLIED TO ALSO THE HOMELESS POPULATION AS WELL. AND LASTLY IN OUR REPORT WE DID FIND THAT CERTAIN VETERANS HOME DO HAVE- HIRING CHALLENGES AND RETENTION ISSUES- SO JUST HIGHLIGHTING THAT AS A AS A CHALLENGE IN OPERATING THE HOMES TODAY. SO IN LIGHT OF THESE FINDINGS ARE OFFICE IDENTIFIED KEY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY AT THE VETERANS HOMES SUCH AS ONE POSSIBLY LOOKING AT THE- ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND PRIORITIZING SIR AND- VETERANS FOR ADMISSIONS OR DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO CONSIDER WAYS IN WHICH IT COULD ALIGN ITS CURRENT LEVELS OF CARE. PROVIDED IN THE VETERANS HOMES TO BETTER REFLECT THE HANGING NEEDS OF THE VETERANS POPULATION. ON ADDITIONALLY WE NOTED HOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECT- THE DEPARTMENT TO DETERMINE WHAT ABOUT THE OPERATIONS IN THE HOMES WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF VETERANS WITH COMPLEX MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND HOPEFULLY THROUGH THAT TO BETTER SERVE VETERANS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN THE PAST. AND LASTLY WE- ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SOME HOMES DO FACE CHALLENGING HIRING A RETENTION SHOES FOR EMPLOYEES- THE LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED DIRECTING CAL THAT WORK WITH CALLIE CHART IN A FIVE ARE THERE BURDENSOME AND UNNECESSARY CRITERIA OR PROCESSES IN PLACE WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATE HIRING PROCESS THAT COULD BE ALLEVIATED. AND IN SOME WAYS HELP SOME OF THESE HOMES- BUT ALSO A COULD THE DEPARTMENT REPORT BCK TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO RETENTION CHALLENGE AT THE WHOLE LEVEL SO IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHEN LOOKING AT THE WHEN I'M THINKING ABOUT SHINS FOR THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED IT IS PROVIDING TARGETED HIRING EVERY INCH AND FUNDS TO CERTAIN HOMES FOR THE POSITIONS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO FILL. I SO WITH THAT. I AFTER THE POP. OF OUR WORK. AS A TO THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BY THE- MADE AN FROM. BUT TRY TO GET AT CHANGING THE VETERANS HOMES. ONE OF THEM WAS CONVERTING TRANSITIONAL- HOUSING PROGRAM BEDS TO SKILLED NURSING IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTY HOME AND THEN ANOTHER WAS EXPANDING THE PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA TO VETERANS WITH THE 70% OR HIGHER SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY. AND BOTH PROPOSALS WERE PROVED BUT I THINK THEY ALSO SERVES TO CONTINUE THIS BROADER CONVERSATION OF OLD WHAT WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE VISION OF THE VETERANS HOMES AND HOW ARE WE MEETING THE CHANGING NEEDS OF VETERANS IN THE FUTURE. SO AS A RESULT AND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM WIDE MASTER PLAN SEVEN AS A PART OF THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET AND INITIAL COMPONENTS OF THE MASTER PLAN INCLUDED. FOLLOW UP ANALYSIS ON HOW THE NEW ADMISSION POLICIES WOULD AFFECT OTHER VETERANS THE OPERATIONS OF THE HOMES AND REVENUES AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT AND PROJECTED LONG TERM CARE NEEDS OF VETERANS. HOW DO A LINE EACH LEVEL OF CARE AT EACH HOME WITH THE FUTURE NEEDS OF VETERANS BUT ALSO INCLUDING HOW TO BEST SERVE VETERANS WITH COMPLEX MENTAL BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS IT WITH THE HOMES. OF AND EVALUATION OF LEASES AT THE HOMES AND CONSIDERTION OF THE ADDITION OF FACILITIES AS OUT PAID CLINIC OR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. IN IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN THE PLEDGES FOR. BY EXPECTATIONS OF MASTER. BY MORE COME. LIKE ASSESSING THE NEED TO EXPAND OR MODIFY OR CLOTHES OR EVEN OPEN MORE FACILITIES BASED OFF OF THE FINDINGS OF HOW THE CHANGING NEEDS OF VETERANS WOULD LOOK LIKE. CONSIDER WAYS OF PROVIDING SERVICES THROUGH DIFFERENT MODELS SUCH AS COMMUNITY BASED CARE SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS THAT WOULD ALLOW VETERANS TO AGE IN PLACE. AND RECEIVE SERVICES WITHIN THEIR EXISTING HOMES OR COMMUNITIES. I'M ALSO A SAYS THE LOCAL AREA COST OF LIVING FOR EMPLOYEES AT CURRENT AND ANY FUTURE PROPOSED SITES. ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATURE THEY CLARIFIED THEIR DESIRE TO HAVE THE MASTER PLAN BE A LIVING DOCUMENT AND WITH THAT- REQUIRED THAT THE MASTER PLAN SHALL BE UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS UPON THE INITIAL RELEASE. SO NOW THAT I SET UP THAT BACKGROUND- ALL MOVE INTO A KIND OF THE KEY QUESTIONS THAT- WE- WE WOULD SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE KEEPS IN MIND AS THEIR PROCESSING THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AGAIN WE'RE STILL ANALYZING THE MASTER PLAN SO WHILE OUR- COMMENTS CAN'T CPAS CAN'T- ART SPECIFIC TO THE- PROCESSES OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS HOPEFULLY WE COULD GET. TO THAT AT A LATER DATE- SO THE FIRST QUESTION THAT WE WOULD RAISE IS WHAT PREDICTIONS DOES THE MAP MASTER PLAN MAKE AND HOW- IN HOW THE NEEDS OF VETERANS WILL CHANGE OVER TIME AND- AS WAS MENTIONED- IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE THE- PROJECTIONS WERE CROSS CUTTING AND THAT THEY BOTH LOOKED AT. THE GENERAL POPULATION OF VETERANS BUT THEN ALSO THE NEEDS OF SUB GROUPS THOSE WITH COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND ON PIECE WERE STILL PROCESSING IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND TO THE DATA THAT WAS USED TO CONSTRUCT THESE PRODUCTIONS AND TO ASSESS THEIR PORTABILITY TO CALIFORNIA. ANOTHER QUESTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO KEEP IN MIND AS- FOR EACH OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND FINDINGS DOES THE MASTER PLAN LAID OUT A CLEAR PATH FORWARD ON WHAT ABOUT THE VETERANS HOME SPECIFICALLY WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF VETERANS IN THE FUTURE- AND IF NOT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE FURTHER EXPLORED OR TEASE DOUBT AND FUTURE ITERATIONS. OF THE MASTER PLAN. ANOTHER QUESTION IS WITH ALL OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WHAT ARE THE TOP PRIORITIES AMONGST THE ADMINS AMONGST THE ADMINISTRATION- WHAT'S THE TIMELINE OF ROLLING OUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WHAT'S THE NECESSARY RESOURCES- TO DO SO. I HOW WILL THE ADMINISTRATION USED THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND FINDINGS IN THE MASTER PLAN TO DIE TO THEIR FUTURE BUDGET AND POLICY WORK. AND WHAT'S THE ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THAT PROCESS HOW WILL THE LEGISLATURE BEING GAUGED AND MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. ON MORE THE LEGISLATURE HOW CAN THE LEGISLATURE USE THE MASTER PLAN TO ALSO ELEVATE THEIR PRIORITIES AND WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE OUT OF THE VETERANS HOME SYSTEM BUT MORE BROADLY MAY BE OUT OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH CAL BUT IN GENERAL- AND AGAIN THIS COULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD- ADDED INTO FUTURE ITERATIONS OF THE MASTER PLAN I THINK. A LOT OF MEMBERS HERE EXPRESS THEIR DESIRE TO FURTHER EXPLORE ADMISSIONS POLICY TO FURTHER EXPLORE- IF FOR NOT PROVIDING LIKE SENATOR OUT THE FOR NOT PROVIDING DOMICILIARY CARE WHAT. CAN WE PROVIDE THAT STILL GETS AT THAT HOUSING THE BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT SERVICE MODEL. I'M I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MENTION AND WHAT ABOUT THE H. H. P. EXPANSION- ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE PLAN IS SPECIFIC TO VETERANS OWNS BUT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE EXPLORED AND FUTURE ITERATIONS AND IF SO HOW CAN THE LEGISLATURE- COMMUNICATE THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE. AN OF SPRING MARKS. AND LASTLY I WOULD KNOW THAT- THERE'S THIS BROADER QUESTION OF HOW DOES THE MASTER PLAN PRESENTED BY CAL THAT FIT INTO OTHER STATEWIDE INITIATIVES THAT THE- THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS CURRENTLY TAKING ON. FOR EXAMPLE- THE ADMINISTRATION IS ENGAGING IN CONSTRUCTING A MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AND THIS IS A BROAD LOOK ON. HOW HOW ARE WE REALIGNING STATE PROGRAMS- LOCAL PROGRAMS IN GENERAL TO MEET THE LONG TERM SERVICES PORTS NEEDS OF SENIORS MOVING FORWARD- THERE'S SOME CLEAR OVERLAP THERE WITH THE MASTER PLAN CALVET SO THERE'S JUST A QUESTION OF HOW THEY WILL. INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND ANOTHER STATEWIDE INITIATIVE THAT WAS MENTIONED IS. THE AUDIT OF STATE LAND AND THE POTENTIAL UED TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING SO HOW DOES THAT ALSO INTERPLAY WITH THE FINDINGS LAID OUT IN THE MASTER PLAN AND THEIR ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE FACILITY USES. SO BAD DAHLE PASS IT ON TO THE OTHER PANELISTS. THANK YOU OKAY I. YOURSELF THANK YOU CERTAINLY. THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR MADAM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS ETHAN RARICK I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. I WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT STATE OVERSIGHT AGENCY THAT INCLUDES FOR MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE ON THE COMMISSION CENTER. I AND NINE PUBLIC MEMBERS WERE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP WE ARE CHARGED IN STATUE WITH MAKING% RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. ABOUT WAYS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF STATE GOVERNMENT I WANTED TO PROVIDE A BIT A BRIEF BACKGROUND ABOUT THE- WORK OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION ON THE VETERANS HOMES- ISSUE. AND HOW I THINK THAT- THAT LED TO THE MASTER PLAN AND HOW THE MASTER PLAN RESPONSE TO SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. I IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN- CHAIR- WHEN ASKED THE- COMMISSION TO STUDY THE FUTURE OF- CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS HOMES AFTER A LENGTHY STUDY THE COMMISSION ISSUED TWO REPORTS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THE FIRST OF THOSE REPORTS- PROVIDED RECOMMENDATIONS TO UPDATE AND MODERNIZE THE HOMES- GENERALLY THE HOMES PROGRAM GENERALLY AND THE SECOND FOCUSED ON THE STATE'S LARGEST AND OLDEST HOME IN YON PHIL- THE COMPLETION OF THE MASTER PLAN- FOR FILLS- ONE OF THE COMMISSION'S PRIMARY RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WAS TO ASSESS- EACH OF THE VETERANS HOMES AND THE NEEDS OF THE VETERANS POPULATION IN. CALIFORNIA TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THINGS LIKE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND LONG TERM PROJECTED LONG TERM CARE NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY OUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE MASTER PLAN- SOMETIMES IN CONJUNCTION WITH. SOME OF THE LEGISLATION THE JACQUI ALREADY MENTIONED- THAT THE MASTER PLAN ADDRESS THE NUMBER. COMMITTEE FROM THE MISSION I INCLUDING THE PRIVATIZATION OF EMISSIONS. THOSE VETERANS THE GREAT NEED. INCREASE FOCUS ON NURSING AND SKILLED NURSING MEMORY CARE. THE GRADUAL ELIMINATION OF DOMICILIARY CARE AT THE WITH- ANY. ROOTED IN THE MASTER PLAN. I OUTSIDE OF THOSE GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS. OF THE COMMISSION URGED CALVET TO THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE YOUNG BILL. CAMPUS WHICH AS YOU ALL KNOW IS A VERY LARGE CAMPUS GEOGRAPHICALLY NOT ONLY TERMS A NUMBER OF BEDS BUT AS A LOT OF ACRES. AGAIN WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THAT A NUMBER OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE COMMISSION. ARE EMBODIED IN THE MASTER PLAN FIRST AND FOREMOST THE COMMISSION CALLED FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AT YOUNTVILLE THAT IS- IN PROCESS NOW. AND PRIORITIZED IN THE MASTER PLAN. THE COMMISSION ALSO CALLED FOR LONG TERM PLANNING FOR THE YACHT BILL CAMPUS IN A WAY THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF RESIDENTS. WHILE ALSO LOOKING FOR OTHER USES THAT COULD BENEFIT BOTH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND VETERANS STATEWIDE. AGAIN THIS RECOMMENDATION IS EMBODIED IN THE MASTER PLANS CALL FOR THIRD PARTY DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD BENEFIT BOTH BOTH THE RESIDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY. ARE THERE ARE OTHER COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ACTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE. OF FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED ALTERING THE FEE STRUCTURE SO THAT IT WOULD BE BASED. ON COST OF CARE NOT ON PERCENTAGE OF INCOME IN ANSWER TO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION CENTER. UNDER THE CURRENT MILITARY AND VETERANS CODE- VETERANS ARE CHARGED A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. TO LIVE IN THE HOME OF THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED CHANGING TO SOME FORMULA- THAT WOULD BE BASED ON COST OF CARE BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE. PROVISION OF THE MILITARY AND VETERANS COAT. IN SHORT WE BELIEVE MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE MASTER PLANNER IN ACCORD WITH THE- COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH- CALVET IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND- FURTHER- IMPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WOULD YOU PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME. JEFF NO NO CHUCK HELD AT- I REPRESENT OR IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES CULTURE ARCH LETTER. AND WHEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK- ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF MY BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND GRATEFUL THAT FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER THIS BRIEF OVERVIEW OVER TWENTY NINETEEN STATE OF THE VETERAN COMMUNITY REPORT. CABS IT WAS ORGANIZED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE IS A CONSORTIUM NOW SEVEN COMMUNITY BASED VETERAN SPECIFIC NONPROFIT AGENCIES. OPERATING FROM Y. RICA EUREKA TO US SAN DIEGO- WE PROVIDE HOUSING IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES FOR VETERANS. AND THEIR FAMILIES AND IN MANY WAYS WE SUPPLEMENT THE MASTER PLAN THAT YOU'VE DISCUSSED TODAY IN THE HOMES PROGRAM AS NON PROFITS WE PROVIDE THAT SECOND BASE OF SUPPORT FOR THE VETERANS IN PROVIDING THEM WITH HOUSING AND- SUPPORT SERVICES. US IS TWENTY SEVENTEEN CABS HAS BEEN PREPARING AN ANNUAL REPORT I'M ON THE STATE OF THAT OUR COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA WITH A FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH RELATED ISSUES. THE REPORT WAS BECAUSE- PREPARED FOR CABS TO BY DOCTOR KATHLEEN WEST AND THROUGH THE SUPPORT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION- OVER THE PLUS PASSED OVER YEARS THIS REPORT IS HELPED INFORM US ON OUR POLICY LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. WE RECENTLY EXCUSE ME COMPLETED THE TWENTY NINETEEN ANNUAL REPORT I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF OUR KEY FINDINGS MANY OF WHICH OVERLAP WITH THE MASTER PLAN DISCUSSION EARLIER TODAY. IT IS JUST AS BEEN DISCUSSED AT LENGTH TODAY MORE BUTTON MORE VETERANS LIVE IN CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER STATE ABOUT 8% OF ALL VETERANS LIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- ONE POINT SIX MILLION VETERANS- SUPPLEMENTED BY FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND- MORE MEMBERS OF THE SELECTED RESERVE- NEARLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S ONE POINT SIX MILLION VETERANS ARE SENIOR CITIZENS. EVEN WITH THIS BRIDGE POPULATION OF VETERANS CALIFORNIA HAS NEARLY A HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND FEAR VETERANS TODAY THAT WE HAD IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. MISTER KLEIN IS PROJECTED TO CONTINUE THE NEARLY HALF OF. THAT IN THE NIGHT SIXTY FIVE THERE'S NO. DE. HELLO HE HAS CLEAR BLUE. DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY THERE'S NEED FOR ELDER CARES. OF THAT ARE NOT AS- IN PLACING CAL. VECTOR CARE POOR. TODAY THE AGING VETERAN POPULATION PARTICULARLY THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATION- SUFFERS FROM MANY CHRONIC AND SEVERE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS AND CHRONICALLY HOMELESS VETERANS ARE AGING WELL BEYOND THEIR YEARS. THIS DINING FACT THESE DAUNTING FACTS WILL REQUIRE INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE CARE FOR SERVICES SUCH AS SKILLED NURSING CARE HOSPICE CARE LIVE IN AIDS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED HOUSING AND MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. THESE ISSUES ARE SHARED NOT THE IMPACT OF THESE ISSUES ARE SHARED BY CAVS FACILITIES AS WELL AS YOUR VETERAN HOME PROGRAM. NOW HEALTH CHALLENGES AFFECT VETERANS OF ALL AGES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHITE MALES OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE OR THE HIGHEST AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF SUICIDE DEATH BY SUICIDE- CONSTITUTING 54% OF ALL CALIFORNIA VETERANS WHO SIDES. TAKE THEIR LIFE COMPARED 233% FOR NON VETERANS. THE PUBLIC OFTEN ASSOCIATES TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER WITH OUR- POST NINE ELEVEN VETERANS HOWEVER THE DEMAND FOR PST TREATMENT HAS STEADILY INCREASED AS WELL AMONG OUR VIETNAM VETERANS. AS THEY AGE. CABS ALSO RECOGNIZES BOTH ITS OBLIGATION AND THE PRIVILEGED ADVOCATE FOR THE VETERAN COMMUNITY FROM THE GROUND UP. BY BRINGING EMERGING IN THE COLLECTED ISSUES TO THE ATTENTION OF POLICYMAKERS AND THE LARGER COMMUNITY THREE SUCH TOPICS OF MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS INCLUDE CALIFORNIA'S ROLE BEDROOMS ARE EXPERIENCING HIGHER OPIOID MISUSE. GROWING HOMELESSNESS AND HIGH SUICIDE RATES WE KNOW THAT OPIATE ADDICTION CAN BE CAN TRITICUM TRIBUTE TO FACTOR IN DEATH BY SUICIDE THAT WE LACK ANY SIGNIFICANT DATA HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF THE RELATIONSHIP. TELL NATIONAL GUARD MANY OF WHOM ARE VETERANS. WHO'S HOT HIGH SUICIDE RATES THE RECENTLY COME TO LIGHT AND WHOSE ACCESS TO VA AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS VERY IS VERY ABLE. CALIFORNIA VETERANS- FAMILY CARE GIVERS SUBJECT TO BURN OUT SECONDARY POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS AND LOWER THAN AVERAGE RATES OF HEALTH CARE AND- OF HEALTH INSURANCE AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC SINCE VETERAN CARE GIVERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE REALLY OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR VETERANS. ON CHILDREN HOMELESSNESS AMONG CALIFORNIA VETERANS REMAINS HIGH. TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED HOMELESS PEOPLE VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA SEVEN THOUSAND OF WHOM ARE ON SHELTERED 6667% DESPITE CALIFORNIA'S MANY OF MANY INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS AND CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO VETERANS HOUSING ISSUES CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ON SHELTER HOMELESS VETERANS THIS REPRESENTS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ALL CABS A MEMBER AGENCIES AND CABS OVERALL BECAUSE A STATUS CONFERS A MULTITUDE OF PROBLEMS. THE INCREASING PERCENTAGE OF ON SHELTERED HOMELESS VETERANS OVERTIME SIGNIFIES A MAJOR THREAT TO MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL WELL FOR VETERANS AND I WOULD ALSO ADD- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE V. H. H. P. PROGRAM THE SEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN VETERANS ARE THE TARGETS FOR THE V. H. H. P. PROGRAM AND THAT THAT WHILE THE VETERAN POPULATION IS DECLINING AT THAT POPULATION CONTINUES TO GROW FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON. SO I'LL CLOSE BY NOTING THAT THE TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT THAT WE HAVE PREPARED WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL YOUR OFFICES- VIA EMAIL BEFORE THE END OF FEBRUARY- WE LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSING THE FINDINGS IN MORE DETAIL AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH NOW WILL OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS FROM THE- SENATE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. YOUR OPEN FOR THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. GEN ROBERT OF THANK YOU UP A QUICK QUESTION YOU HAD INDICATED THAT YOU THAT THE AND IT WAS THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION SUGGESTED THAT THE- ACOSTA SAYS WOULD NOT BE BASED ON INCOME BUT ON COSTS OF CARE IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE- THAT'S CORRECT YES AND WE DID NOT SPECIFY A PARTICULAR FORMULA BUT WE RECOMMEND TO THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED THAT THE STATE MOVE FROM A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME TO A TO SOME FORMULA BASED ON COST OF CARE. BUT THE BUT THE CURRENT FORM. IN THE- MILITARY VETERAN US CODE RIGHT. ARM JUST JUST A COMMENT THAT WOULD TROUBLE ME GREATLY IF WE BASICALLY SKEWED SERVICES TO THOSE WHO ARE WEALTHIER VERSUS THOSE WHO ARE NOT- STE. FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION OF. ALSO WORKED WITH AND- AGAIN I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING GONE FOR A PORTION OF THE HEARING- I NOTE FROM THE VARIOUS HOMES THAT ONE OF THE- ISSUES THAT SEEMS TO BE PREVALENT THROUGHOUT ALL THE HOMES IS THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT- EMPLOYEES WITH THE NECESSARY SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO. CARE FOR VETERANS IN THE WAY WE EXPECT THEM TO BE CARED FOR- IT HAD HAD ANY OF THE GROUPS LA- OR ANY OTHERS- CONSIDERED RECOMMENDING- SOME SORT OF COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. BASED ON LOCALITY I MEAN WHAT WEST LA IS GOT TO BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN BARSTOW AND IF AND IF YOU HAVE AND I MISSED IT I APOLOGIZE BUT- JUST. MEDICARE OUT CITY. I CAN SPEAK TO THAT- IN OUR REPORT WE DID IDENTIFY THE ISSUE OF HIRING A RETENTION AND ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. COULD REQUIRE CALVET TO SUBMIT TO REGULAR LEASE- WERE REGULARLY DATA ON RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION SO YOU COULD ASSESS WHICH POSITIONS ARE REALLY THE HARDEST TO HIGHER. INTEREST THROUGH THAT- WITH THE THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS AND THEN CONSIDER- PROVIDING HOMES WITH TARGETED RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION FUNDING- FOR THOSE HARDEST TO HIGHER POSITIONS. ARE IN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. MITCHELL QUESTIONS OF CENTER ROTH THEM THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS CHAIR WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT COST OF CARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. KAREN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY OR YOU TALKING ABOUT RESIDENCY IN THE DUMBEST SO REPROGRAM- IT COULD BE AGAIN THE COMMISSION DID NOT SPECIFY A PARTICULAR FORMULAS RED COULD BE ANY OF THOSE THE I THINK THE THRUST OF THAT RECOMMENDATION WAS ON ON DOMICILIARY CARE ALTHOUGH THAT WILL. IN OUR RESEARCH IT WILL DECLINE OVER TIME LARGELY DUE TO DEMAND BECAUSE OF IT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. DEPENDING ON YOUR OF VA DISABILITY RATE THERE'S A- A REIMBURSEMENT THAT FLOWS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATE ON THAT ONE AND CORRECT- AND I IT. PERHAPS IF YOU HAVE SOME OTHER. TYPE OF HEALTH INSURANCE THERE'S SOME REIMBURSEMENT THAT. FLOWS THERE AS WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER- THE DUMBEST CELERY SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE IS LIVING IN A ROOM. A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES IS THE- PAYMENT AND THEN WE CHARGE THE RESIDENT BASED ON THEIR INCOME FOR THE- RESIDENCY IN THAT ROOM. SO BE INTERESTED EXPLORING THAT AND THAT TIES IN TO MY COMMENT WHICH IS THIS AYE I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO. TAKE A LOOK AT THE DUMBEST SO REPROGRAM THE HISTORICALLY WE HAVE OPERATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ASSESS ITS CONTINUED VIABILITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART OF CERTAINLY WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION IN MY VIEW AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE SURE THIS TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS POPULATION. IF WE HAVE HOMELESS VETERANS WE NEED TO FIND A PLACE FOR THEM TO LIVE. IF WE HAVE VETERANS WHO WERE NOT HOMELESS WHO CHOOSE TO LIVE THERE THAN I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO STEP ESTAS STATE AS TO WHETHER TO. CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HOUSING ON ON THIS BASIS OR HOUSING ON SOME OTHER BASIS WHETHER IT'S IN THE FORM OF VOUCHERS OR OTHERWISE. IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET PLACE ASSUMING. IN OUR HOUSING MARKET THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY. HOUSING EXISTS- FOR THE MONEY THAT EITHER THE VETERANS HAVE OR THAT WE'RE WILLING TO PAY AND IF NOT WE NEED TO. PERHAPS REVISIT THE CONTINUATION OF THE DUMBEST SO RE PROGRAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU US ASSEMBLYMEMBER IF YOU HAD A QUESTION AND THEY AYE SENATOR AND THEN ASSEMBLYMAN- GLORIA AYE AYE IS NAVY FOR AYE AYE. SO ONE OF MY GREAT CONCERNS IS THE FEMALE SUICIDE RATE FOR VETERANS AND ALSO ACTIVE DUTY BUT THAT'S NOT OUR PREVIEW. BUT FOR VETERANS- MIGHT. NUMBERS THAT I'M GETTING FROM THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS THE AMERICAN LEGION AND DIFFERENT- AND A TOTAL INFORMATION IS FEMALE VETERANS HAVE A 22240% HIGHER SUICIDE RATE THE MALE VETERANS. EN GOOGLE IT BUT- I'M NOT SEEING THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL DO AND DEADLY ABOUT IT. SO IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO ABOUT IT THAT'S MY QUESTION AND YOU PROBABLY CAN'T ANSWER IT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ANSWERED UP HERE BUT- WHAT WHAT I WOULD WOULD ADD- ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOCAL THAT THAT. YOUR STATISTICS ARE RELATIVELY ACCURATE CAN WE CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOWER NUMBER OF FEMALE VETERANS RIGHT NOW BUT A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THOSE FEMALE VETERANS HAVE. THEN SUFFERED DEATH THROUGH SUICIDE- WE HAVE- AT CABS IS AGENCIES ARE TRYING TO START SEPARATE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON WOMEN VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND SO NOT ONLY IS A SUICIDE RATE A PROBLEM- THE GENERAL CARE- AND MODIFYING OUR FACILITIES TO CARE FOR WOMEN VETERANS IS ALSO ANOTHER LARGE PROBLEM FOR US. THANK ASSEMBLY GLORIA FAMOUS CHAIR THANK YOU TO THE PRESENTERS- I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER THIS QUESTION BUT THAT WAS WORTH ASKING BASED ON THE MASTER PLAN THERE'S A SERIES OF PROJECTIONS ARE ESTIMATES- AS THE SECRETARY INDICATED BAHRAIN YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT NATIONAL CONFLICT OR NATIONAL CONFLICTS. AT DO YOU ARE YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROJECTIONS THE METHODOLOGY THEY USED TO PROJECT POPULATION NEED- IN CALIFORNIA. TO A TO A I WOULD SAY FOR BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING YES BUT I WOULD- ECHOED JACQUI EARLIER COMMENT THAT THE- THREE HUNDRED PAGE DOCUMENT AND WOOD WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT IT WELL TO. ROSS IS STILL LOOKING AT IT BUT JUST BASED OFF OF THEIR COMMENTS TODAY THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT SOME OF IT MAY BE NATIONAL AND NOT SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE WOULD- LOOK AT TO SEE HOW A PLUGGABLE IT IS THEN TO THE CALIFORNIA CONTACT. AND I RECOGNIZE IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO. FOR YES HUMAN. BEHAVIOR ETCETERA ETCETERA BUT AS WE TRY PLAN FOR NEED- HE DOES FOR TO SEE. THE ADJUSTMENTS I THINK WITH SECRETARY SAID THAT WE'RE NOW NUMBER NUMBER TO THE STATE- INTO THE VETERAN POPULATION WHICH IS. DISCONCERTING I'VE BEEN A SAN DIEGANS- ALTHOUGH I'M GLAD TO SEE THE ROLE THAT SAN DIEGO WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY. A PROMINENT LONER CLIFORNIA VETERAN COMMUNITY- SO IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE- PROJECTIONS I GUESS ONE OF THINGS THAT TOOK AWAY FOR THE MASTER PLAN AND THE CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD ON THE VETERANS COMMITTEE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. IS THE PLACEMENT OF THE HOMES- OR THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE AND HOW. DICE A RADICAL OUT OF WHACK THEY ARE COMPARED TO NEED. I'M SO HENCE THE PROJECTIONS. NEED UNDERSTAND IT THAT'S BENEFICIAL. OR OR OR OR OR RIGHT IN I RECOGNIZE LAW THAT'S ACADEMIC GIVEN THAT WE DON'T MEET ALL THE DEMAND- THAT'S OUT THERE- BUT- I GUESS THE QUESTION FILIOQUE SHOULD POSE SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE OUGHT TO ASK GOING FORWARD. WHAT WILL HAS THE ASSEMBLY OR THE LEGISLAURE ASH SAY. PLATED AND PASSED LOCATION OF VETERANS HOME A CO BECAUSE THAT IS IN VOTING FOR. VETERAN HOME BONDS BUT I DON'T. RECALL THAT BEING SPECIFIC TO WHERE WE GOT TO PLACE IT. I KNOW THERE'S THE VETOES FIVE RULES NOW SERVE THEY DON'T KNOW HOPEFULLY THAT WOULD IN. THERE WITH THE MISTAKES WILL BE MADE GOING FOR BUT- IS THERE LEGISLATIVE. REQUIREMENT BEFORE THE A HOME IS CITED OR IF THAT. WOULD AYE AYE MAGICAL CLOSURE WAS REQUIRED WOULD HAVE TO HAVE WE ARE. WEIGH IN ON THAT- BUT FUTURE SIGHTING OF HOMES IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE GET TO DO IS AS SOON AS DECIDED BY OTHERS. I MEAN IT TIES TO ON THE QUESTIONS THAT RE RAISED IS HOW WILL THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS MASTER PLAN ACTUALLY ROLLOUT BUT JUST IN OUR PRIOR EXPERIENCE MOST RECENTLY. THE PROPOSAL TO. CONSTRUCT A- NEW REPLACEMENT SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WITHIN YACHT BILL. IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS SO THAT'S WHERE THE LEGISLATURE COULD. CONNECT BUT- IS THERE A WAY IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE. INSIGHTS FEED ACT THEIR PRIORITY WHAT THEIR THOUGHTS ARE BEFORE IT GETS TO THAT LEVEL AND THAT'S A- A QUESTION OF. THE PROCESS OF. HOW WILL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS BE MOVING AND WHERE WILL THE LEGISLATURE NOT WHAT STAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE BEING GAUGED. I BELIEVE THE MASTER PLAN REQUIRED BE UPDATED WITH SOME REGULARITY CRACK. EVERY FIVE YEARS- SO THEORETICALLY THERE'S A THERE'S A HOOK IN THERE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO WAY AND IF WE START TO SEE. A HOME BEING ABOUT HOW. IN LOVE DESERT. IN THEIR HEAD AND NECK COMMISERATE FULL ENOUGH VENTURE OUT TO A DESERT WE BE ABLE HAVE SOME WAITED FLUENCE THAT PROCESS. YES AND IT SALAS. ABOUT GETTING TO CENTER ON BIRDS. QUESTION ABOUT RELOCATION. IF THAT'S- THAT YOU WOULD ALSO WANT TO SEE IN FUTURE RATIONS OF WHAT WHAT. OF LOCATION. LOOK LIKE. THOSE THINGS THAT COULD BE. I'M EXPLORED I JUST I REMARK ON THIS OR LOOK AT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A HEAD SCRATCH. IN THE- OF OUR HOUSING. GENERAL ARE HOME DESCRIBES WAS. AND THE NUMBER OF ACTION OF OVER. IN BOTH AND- TO THE EXTENT ANY ON YOU TO. CAPACITY IN THE SYSTEM YOU KNOW WE SHOULD ALL BE EMBARRASSED BY THAT AND WE SHOULD BE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO FIX IT I RECOGNIZE THE MASTER PLAN TO STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. I BELIEVE THE AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THAT. BUT SOME OF US JUST GEOGRAPHY- IF THAT'S THE CASE- DEAL ME IN ON TRIED INFLUENCE HOW THIS COMES OUT- VETOES FIVE WILL BE BECOME. YOU KNOW STATE LAW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT- BUT- YOU YOU GET MY POINT ABOUT. THE YOU KNOW IT'S FIVE THE PERSONALITIES THE ALIGNMENT CHECK AROUND THE STABLES ALL BODY ON THIS BUT WHO'S TO SAY. TERMINATES ADMINISTRATIONS BEING WHAT THEY ARE. THAT THE COMMON SENSE WILL PREVAIL ON THAT WE DON'T BILL THAT HOME OUT IN ILLINOIS WHERE YOU GET MY POINT BUT- SOMEONE ASKED TO. HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THE PUBLIC ON WHAT THE STATE IS DOING CORRECTLY NOT CORRECTLY. I'LL MAKE SURE THAT WE DO MORE THAT WE CAN- AND AGAIN THAT NEED. AND ON UTILIZED CAPACITY IS SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US SHOULD BE WORKING. I CAN'T TO FIX. STILL IN THE- CHAIR. NORTHERN IRAQ. I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER THE SENATE. WHEN FOR THE PUBLIC COMMON AND CLOSING. ASIDE AS- FIRST ONE THANK BOTH OF OUR PANELS. AND I DO WANT TO. ESPECIALLY THANK THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION WHO TOOK THIS ISSUE ON A NUMBER OF YEARS AND- AND IT WAS A VERY THOROUGH REPORT AND- AND YOU CAN SAY IT SEE THAT MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE.
