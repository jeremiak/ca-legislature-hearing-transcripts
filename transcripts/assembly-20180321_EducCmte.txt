TRAFFICKERS ARE QUICKLY ADAPTING TO NEW AGE MEDIA SOCIAL MANY OUTLETS LIKE FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ALLOWED TRAFFICKERS. DO CONTACT KIDS WHO THEY FEEL ARE MOST VULNERABLE. MOBILE MOBILE PHONE DEVICE APPLICATION SUCH A SNAPSHOT ALLOWED TRAFFICKERS TO LEAVE NO TRACE CHAD HISTORIES ARE AUTOMATICALLY DELETED. WHEN ONE LOGS OUT DELETE THE APP OR THE COUNT IS DEACTIVATED. FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE PREVENTIVE MEASURES MUST BE TAKEN AND THE START WITH EDUCATION OUR CHILDREN. LAST YEAR LEGISLATION REQUIRED HUMAN TRAFFICKING PREVENTION.

THIS BILL SIMPLY CLARIFIES THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND MOBILE PHONE APPLICATIONS TO BE INCLUDED IN EDUCATION PROVIDED TO THE STUDENTS. TODAY I'M JOINED BY THE ADVOCATE FROM FAMILY SYSTEM OPEN DOOR PROGRAM WHO WORKS WITH SURVIVORS EVERYDAY. AND COOPER FROM THE CITY MANAGER POLICE DEPARTMENT WHO WORKS FOR THE SOMEBODY NO HUMAN TRIP TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE. DOES FIND SUPPORT. YOUR WITNESS MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AMBER'S THANK YOU FOR HAVING TODAY. MY NAME IS EMILY DICKSON AND I AM A SURVIVOR ADVOCATE. FOR VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING INSANITY NO COUNTY. TODAY I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF OPEN DOOR PROGRAM A. NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT HELPS SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE DUE TO THE FACT THAT WITHIN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE HAD CLIENTS COME THROUGH OUR PROGRAM WHO WERE RECRUITED ONLINE. OUR CLIENTS DISCLOSE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA SITES HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THE GROOMING AND RECRUITMENT OF VICTIMS. WE LEARNED THAT SOME VICTIMS WERE BEFRIENDED BY TRAFFICKERS WHO AT FIRST POSE AS A FRIEND WHO WAS ATTRACTED TO THE VICTIM AND WANTED TO BUILD SOME KIND OF ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. THE TRAFFICKERS WOULD HAVE INTIMATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR VICTIMS TO FIND OUT ALL VULNERABILITIES DISLIKES AND WANTS IN ORDER TO PREY ON THEM. AT THE BEACH VICTIMS WEAKEST MOMENT THE TRAFFICKER WOULD POUNCE AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS A SAVIOR AND OR A RESCUER. ONLY DISSECT THEM INTO A LIFESTYLE OF EXPLOITATION AND MEANS OF SURVIVAL. IN ADDITION TO ONLINE RECRUITMENT BY TRAFFICKERS THEMSELVES WE HAVE ALSO WORKED WITH VICTIMS WHO WERE RECRUITED ONLINE BY OTHER HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS. WHO ARE ALSO KNOWN AS THE BOTTOM? THE BOTTOM WILL BE FROM THE TRAFFICKERS NEXT POTENTIAL VICTIM AND FLASH PICTURES THE MONEY MATERIALISTIC ITEMS SUCH AS HIGH AND PURSES CARS CLOTHING ETCETERA. ONCE THE VICTIM SHOWS INTEREST THE BOTTOM WILL CONTINUE TO INITIATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE VICTIM TO GLAMORIZING GLORIFY THE LIFE AND MAKE PROMISES TO THE VICTIM THAT HE OR SHE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE SAME ITEMS. IN THE VICTIM'S WEAKEST MOMENT THE TRAFFICKER WILL HAVE HIS OR HER BOTTOM JUMP ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACT AS THE SAVIOR RESCUER TO THE VICTIM. AND THEN INTRODUCE THEM TO A LIFE OF HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING AND EXPLOITATION. FOR THOSE FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK THAT A. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE GET PAST EDUCATING YOUTH ON THE DANGERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND MOBILE PHONE DEVICES IS VITAL WHEN TEACHING ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. PREVENTIVE MEASURES THANK YOU. THANK YOU UNDER TWO MINUTES WELL DONE YOUR NEXT WITNESS. YOUR CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY. MY NAME IS NICK LEFFLER I'M A CORPORAL WITH THE CITY OF ONTARIO POLICE DEPARTMENT. I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE SAN MARINO COUNTY HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE. LARGELY OUR SOCIETIES UNAWARE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THE SUB CULTURE OF COMMERCIALIZED SEX FOR SALE BUT AS PRESIDENT AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE. SINCE MAY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OUR TASK FORCES RESCUED FORTY NINE ADULTS AND TWENTY FIVE JUVENILES DURING HUMAN TRAFFICKING INVESTIGATION. WE HAVE FOUND JUVENILE VICTIMS THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. DURING THESE INVESTIGATIONS WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE PRIMARY RECRUITING GROUND FOR JUVENILES IS ON THE INTERNET THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDES A PLATFORM FOR TRAFFICKERS TO BEFRIEND BEFRIEND MINERS INITIATE SECRET RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM ENGAGE IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS. AND EVENTUALLY BEGIN TO MANIPULATE THEM INTO WORKING FOR THEM AS COMMERCIAL SEX WORKERS. I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TWO EXAMPLES TO PUT INTO CONTEXT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AFTER WORKING HUMAN TRAFFICKING INVESTIGATIONS FOR JUST A SHORT TIME. IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT TRAFFICKERS RECRUITING THEIR VICTIMS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. TO COMBAT THIS TYPE OF CRIME AND PRO ACTIVELY SEEK OUT THE TRAFFICKERS I DECIDED TO CREATE A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT. POSING AS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD FEMALE GIRL. DURING THE FIRST FULL DAY OF MAINTAIN THIS ACCOUNT I'D RECEIVED NUMEROUS FROM REQUESTED OVER FIFTY MESSAGES FROM TRAFFICKERS WHO WERE ATTEMPTING TO BEGIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIS FICTITIOUS CHILD. I'VE SINCE ARRESTED SEVERAL OF THOSE PREDATORS FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING BASED ON THEIR CONVERSATIONS WITH ME IN THAT UNDERCOVER ROLE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE CONNECTION CONNECTION BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS THIS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DECEMBER DANIELLE TASK FORCE BEGAN AN INVESTIGATION WHICH LED TO THE ARREST OF THE SUSPECTED CAMP IN THE CITY OF ONTARIO. DURING THE INVESTIGATION WE LEARN THAT THE SUSPECTED CAMPAIGN USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO ATTEMPT TO BEFRIEND AND RECRUIT AT LEAST FIVE RANDOM FEMALES PER DAY. IS IMPORTANT WE EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN ABOUT THE ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND HIDDEN DANGERS THAT EXIST IN THE REALM OF SOCIAL MEDIA SO THEY CAN GUARD THEMSELVES AGAINST BECOMING THE NEXT VICTIM.

CITY COLLEGES SAN FRANCISCO HE TEACHES LABOR HISTORY. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN WHICH OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE HAS MISTER WRAPS AT MY NAME IS FRED CLASS THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MAY FIRST AS A WORKERS HOLIDAY. AND WHY SHOULD WE SHOULD ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA. THE HOLIDAY SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS BELONGING TO EVERY WORKER EVERYWHERE IT CELEBRATES THE BIRTH OF THE MOVEMENT FOR THE EIGHT HOUR WORKDAY A SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE GOAL. AT A TIME IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN TEN EVEN TWELVE HOUR DAYS WERE COMMON SIX AND SOMETIMES SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. HE WOULD WRITE AN HISTORIC INJUSTICE FOR THE HOLIDAY TO FINALLY BE CELEBRATED OFFICIALLY SOMEWHERE IN UNITED STATES. THAT'S BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY IS WHERE THE EVEN SICKERT STRIKES AND DEMONSTRATIONS BY A LARGELY IMMIGRANT WORKFORCE IN THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES THAT BEGAN THE MOVEMENT FOR THE EIGHT HOUR DAY WHICH WAS ONLY CROWNED WITH SUCCESS FIFTY YEARS LATER. THE PASSAGE OF THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT. HELPING STUDENTS UNDERSTAND WHERE THEIR BASIC WORKPLACE RIGHTS COME FROM IS CRUCIAL TO PROTECTING THEM TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE. THESE RIGHTS WERE HARD WON OFTEN AT THE COST OF WORKERS JOBS. BLOOD IN LIVES. IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT PROVIDING PEACEFUL CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN THE WORKPLACE THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE A YEAR AFTER A WAVE OF GENERAL STRIKES WITNESSED INJURIES TO HUNDREDS. AND IN SOME PLACES THOUSANDS OF WORKERS AND THE DEATHS BUT DOZENS. I MADE A HOLIDAY INAPPROPRIATE LABOR HISTORY EDUCATIONAL EXERCISE OF SURROUNDING IT WOULD PROVIDE STUDENTS MANY OF WHOM ALREADY WORK WITH AN APPRECIATION FOR WHAT IT TOOK TO CREATE WORKPLACE RIGHTS AND WHAT THEY STAND TO LOSE IF THOSE RIGHTS ARE LIMITED. IN SHORT THE MERIT OF THE HOLIDAY THE MERITS OF THE HOLIDAY FIT CLOSELY WITH WHAT CALIFORNIA STANDS FOR TODAY AS AN ISLAND OF SANITY UNDER THE CURRENT FEDERAL POLITICAL AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT.

IN HERE MISTER GALLAGHER WILL RESENT AB TWO SIX TWO ZERO SIX SEVEN TWO ZERO SIX SEVEN. IT'S ITEM NUMBER EIGHT PILOT RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME OF THIS THIS MORNING. AB TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN. IS MY BILL A DILEMMA SCHOOL SAFETY IN HAVING. ARMED SECURITY AT OUR. SCHOOLS. AND I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF. THROUGH FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE. OF THE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED REGARDING. REMOVING PRIVATE. SCHOOL SECURITY GUARDS AND ALSO INCLUDING CHARTER SCHOOLS. IN THIS MANDATE. AND SO WE WOULD TAKE THOSE THOSE TWO AMENDMENTS AND. AND. YEAH THIS THIS ISSUE REALLY OBVIOUSLY CAME. VERY CLOSE TO HOME FOR US IN IN MY DISTRICT. Z. AS YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT EARLIER TODAY IN THE COMMITTEE. THE SMALL SCHOOL OF RANCHO TO HIM AND MY DISTRICT. JUST. WEST OF THE COMMUNITY A CORNY AND TAMAR COUNTY. HAD A VERY TRAGIC ATTACK. AND THAT MAN WENT ON A RAMPAGE TO THIS COMMUNITY. I ULTIMATELY GOING ON TO THE SCHOOL GROUNDS R. RANCHO TO HIM ELEMENTARY. AT THE END OF THE DAY FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED. A COMMUNITY WAS COMPLETELY DEVASTATED AND. AND. YOU KNOW A SCHOOL. AND IN CHILDREN WERE LOCKED IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. BEING SHOT AT FROM OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM BY THIS BY THIS GUN MEN. YOU KNOW IN TALKING WITH THE STAFF. AND TEACHERS AFTERWARDS SO YOU CAN IMAGINE OBVIOUSLY THE. THE*. THAT THEY WENT THROUGH AND AS THIS WAS TRANSPIRING. BUT ALSO THAT THE GREAT COURAGE THAT WE SAW OUT OF THE STAFF MEMBERS AND TEACHERS. WHO WERE ABLE TO LOCK DOWN THE CLASSROOM? AND THEY HAD HAD TRAINING. AS MISTER RODRIGUEZ BILLETS IS PROPOSING TO DO. AND THEY ACTED VERY QUICKLY AND THEY SAVE LIVES THAT DAY BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID. WE ALSO DID HAVE A A COMMUNITY MEMBER WHO. WHO DISTRACTED THE GUNMAN AS HE WAS SHOOTING INTO CLASSROOMS AND ALSO THEY GOT HIM TO? YOU KNOW COME OUT OF THE SCHOOL GROUNDS. AND SO THERE WAS A LOT OF HEROISM THAT HAPPEN THERE TO HELP SAVE LIVES THAT DAY. BUT AS AS YOU KNOW AS WE CONSIDER THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE AFTERMATH OF THESE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. OTHERS SO MANY THERE'S MULTIPLE PRONGS HERE WE KNOW THERE'S MULTIPLE THINGS WE NEED TO DO. AND. AT TO STOP THIS BUT THAT THE SAD REALITY IS THAT WE ARE SEEN THESE. HORRENDOUS ATTACKS. GO TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE OUR KIDS OUR MOST PRECIOUS. COMMODITY IN THE STATE. ARE VULNERABLE. TO THESE TO THESE ATTACKS AND SO. YOU KNOW IS I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO BETTER. I WAS CONSIDERING THAT IN THE SCHOOL RESA RESOURCE OFFICER PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE THAT MANY SCHOOLS. THAT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WHY NOT HAVE THESE INDIVIDUALS AT EVERY AND EVERY SCHOOL IN THE STATE. A TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOMEONE THERE. WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO STOP THESE ATTACKS WHEN THEY HAPPENED THAT WE WOULDN'T JUST HAVE TO HOLD UP IN OUR CLASSROOMS AND HOPE? THAT SOMETHING DOESN'T MORE DIRE DOESN'T HAPPEN. ALL THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE DONE WE NEED TO HAVE TRAINING. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN BE A FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE. AND YOU KNOW I THINK THE MERITS OF THIS POLICY. NO REALLY WERE SHOWN YESTERDAY IN MARYLAND. WHERE WE HAD ENOUGH SORROW? A WHO ACTED LEGALLY IN. IN SECONDS. UNDER A MINUTE I WON THE FIRST. WHEN THE SHOOTING BEGAN AT A SCHOOL THERE IN MARYLAND AND WAS ABLE TO DISPATCH. AND STOP THE SHOOTER. FROM CARRYING OUT MORE THE. FOR SHE MORE STUDENTS ON CAMPUS ARE STILL WAS TRAGICALLY TO PEOPLE SHOT. BUT CLEARLY EVERYBODY THAT. HAS REPORT ON THIS IS SAID THIS THIS HELP STOP AND HELP PREVENT. FEET MORE LOSS OF LIFE. WE'VE ALSO SEEN THIS ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THE S. AROSE DOWN AND ACTUALLY SELLING CALIFORNIA THAT. SECURITY GUARD WHO OVERHEARD A CONVERSATION ULTIMATELY WAS ABLE TO GO SEARCH A. STUDENTS HOMEROOM WHEN THEY FOUND WEAPONS WERE ABLE TO WHAT THEY BELIEVE PREVENT. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN ATTACK AS WELL SO THIS IS A GOOD PROGRAM THAT WORKS THE S. R. AW UP PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS BILL IS THAT? THERE WOULD BE AN SRO A TRAINED. PEACE OFFICER ON EVERY CAMPUS. THIS WOULD BE A REIMBURSABLE MANDATE. FOR OUR SCHOOLS. AND IT WOULD APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD NOW WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO CHARTER SCHOOLS AS WELL AND AND SO. I WOULD ASK YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS MEASURE I THINK IT'S A MUCH NEEDED. NO DEFENSE YEAH THERE'S GOING TO BE A CASA THAT LOBBYISTS HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. BUT FOR ME YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PUT A PRICE ON PEACE OF MIND WHEN IT COMES TO OUR KIDS INSIDE ASK YOUR. AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION A MEMBERS THINK I DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES WITH ME AND SUPPORT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TWO MINUTES EACH POLICEMAN. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M KAREN VIA LOBOS. TWIN RIVERS CHARTER SCHOOL FORMALLY EAST NICHOLAS HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF A SRO. AS I TALK TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER IT'S AS PREVENTIVE AS IT IS THE INCIDENT WE KNOW THAT EFFECTIVE BEST SORROWS BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH STUDENTS WE KNOW STUDENTS. ARE MOST LIKELY GOING TO BE THE PERPETRATORS AND IF WE CAN BE PREVENTIVE. AND HOW THAT RELATIONSHIP ON CAMPUS IT'S GOING TO SAVE LIVES AS WELL. MY NAME IS DAN RAMOS AND I'VE WORKED WITH C. PRINCIPLE LAS PLUMAS HIGH SCHOOL ONE OR OF ALL FOR NINE YEARS I ALSO HAVE SEVENTEEN YEARS EXPERIENCE AS AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN AND VOLUNTEER FIRE CAPTAIN WITH BUTTE COUNTY FIRE. WHERE I'VE RECEIVED ADVANCED TRAINING AN ACTIVE SHOOTER TRAUMA RESPONSE? IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR IN CHARGE AT THE TIME WHEN AN ARM STUDENT GREAT RIGHT TOOK NEARLY THIRTY HOSTAGES. IN OUR BAND ROOM. A STANDOFF ENSUED THE GUNMEN FIRED TWO SHOTS HOWEVER NO ONE WAS INJURED. WE DID NOT HAVE A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER ON CAMPUS THAT DAY. I'M IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN AS I RECALL THE LONELY AND. TERRIFYING FEELING THE TAKES HOLD WHILE WE WAITED FOR ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ARRIVE AND TAKE CHARGE OF THE SITUATION. AND THAT AMOUNT OF TIME WE COULD EASILY BEEN AT THE TOP OF THE LIST OF DEADLY SCHOOL INCIDENTS IN THE NATION. WE'RE JUST LUCKY. I ALSO KNOW THAT IMMEDIATE ARMED OPPOSITION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO STOP AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. ALONG WITH MY SUPPORT I URGE HIS BODY TO ENSURE THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE FULLY FUNDED TO SUPPORT THE PLACEMENT OF ARMED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN RURAL SCHOOLS. ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO HOW FUNNY AND WE'LL GET TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS THE MANDATED COST REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN A RELIABLE. OR TIMELY SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. CURRENTLY THE MANDATED COSTS FUNDS THAT ARE DISTRICT RECEIVES WOULD BARELY SUPPORT THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR YOUR PRICE TAG. OF ONE DEPUTY THAT ROTATES BETWEEN FOR SCHOOLS WITHOUT ALLOWING A SINGLE DOLLAR FINE OTHER STATE MANDATED ACTIVITIES. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT YOU TAKE SCHOOL SAFETY SERIOUSLY AND TARGET FINDING THOSE FULLY AND SPECIFICALLY SUPPORTING ARMED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN SCHOOLS. ADDITIONALLY I FEEL THAT SWORN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE FORM OF SECURITY IN SCHOOLS THEY HAVE THE TRAINING EQUIPMENT DIRECT ACCESS. TO OTHER AGENCIES THAT IS NEEDED TO RESPOND A MAJOR VIOLENT INCIDENTS. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT MAKE UP THE MICROPHONE STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION. AND POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY REFERENCED LA CARTE ARMED GUARDS SECURITY TRAINING ACADEMY IN FULL SUPPORT. THERE GOES A WEIRDO I'M GONNA FIVE REDUCTION IN FULL SUPPORT. MISTER FRANCIS GUERRILLAS DOCTOR VELOS YUBA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS IN STRONG SUPPORT. LIEUTENANT STEVE BOYD FROM THE BUTTE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE ON BEHALF OF FEAR OF KOREA ONLY. FULL SUPPORT. CHARLES TRACY FORMER POLICE OFFICER HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR FOR LYNDHURST HIGH SCHOOL NINETEEN NINETY TWO. AND SUPERINTENDENT A HAMILTON UNIFIED IN FULL SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON. KATHY SHORT FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE RESPECTFULLY NOLES DEPOSED AB TWENTY TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN. WE ALL AGREE THAT SCHOOL SAFETY IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL CHILDREN SHOULD BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON LEARNING WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY. PARENTS TO FEEL THAT SCHOOL IS A PLACE WHERE THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE PROTECTED FROM HARM. THE MISSION OF EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN HOUSE TO START WITH PROVIDING A SAFE PLACE TO LEARN. WE DISAGREE AS TO HOW TO MAKE SURE OUR SCHOOLS ARE SAFE. PUTTING A GUARD OR OFFICER IN EVERY SCHOOL AS AB TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN PROPOSES TO DO IS NOT THE ANSWER. PUTTING GUNS IN SCHOOLS IN THE HANDS OF SECURITY GUARDS OR SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS OR ANYONE ELSE. WILL MAKE SCHOOLS LESS SAFE NOT MORE SUBTLE. WE SAW THIS WITH THE INCIDENT MONTEREY LAST WEEK WHERE THREE STUDENTS WERE INJURED BY A TEACHER WHO WAS ALSO A RESERVE POLICE OFFICER. ACCIDENTALLY DISCHARGING A GUN IN CLASS. BUT THE PROBLEM WITH PLACING A SECURITY GUARD A RESOURCE OFFICER AT EVERY SCHOOL EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE RISK OF THE USE OF THAT PERSON'S GOT. FOR MANY STUDENTS THE PRESENCE OF AN ARMED OFFICER MAKE SCHOOL FEEL MORE LIKE A DETENTION CENTERS ON A SCHOOL. A PLACE WHERE THEY ARE SEEN AS SUSPECTS. SADLY ALL TOO OFTEN THAT FEELING IS REINFORCED WHEN OFFICERS ON CAMPUS ARE BROUGHT INTO WHAT SHOULD BE ROUTINE SCHOOL DISCIPLINARY MATTERS. ONLY TO ESCALATE THE INCIDENT TO THE POINT SOMETIMES OF USING EXCESSIVE FORCE AGAINST STUDENTS. WE'VE ALL SEEN THE VIDEOS IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE. STUDENTS PUSHED WERE THROWN TO THE GROUND BY OFFICERS IN THEIR SCHOOLS. SOMETIMES WERE OFFENSES AS MINOR AS FAILING TO PUT AWAY A CELL PHONE. FOR THESE STUDENTS AND MANY OTHERS THE PRESENCE OF A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER FEELS LIKE A THREAT NOT A SOURCE OF PROTECTION. WE NEED TO BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO REDUCE THE PRESENCE OF POLICE IN OUR SCHOOLS NOT TO INCREASE THE. WE KNOW HOW TO KEEP OUR SCHOOLS SAFE. WE NEED TO MAKE OUR SCHOOLS INTO WELCOMING AN INCLUSIVE PLACES. THAT SUPPORT THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH OF THE STUDENTS AND THAT HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BUILD COMMUNITY AND ADDRESS CONFLICT WITH NON PUNITIVE METHODS. LET'S FOCUS ON PROVIDING STE SCHOOLS WITH THOSE RESOURCES RATHER THAN INVESTING IN EXPENSIVE MEASURES THAT WILL JUST MAKE THINGS WORSE. WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. TONY TO CAROL AND HAVE THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE HAVE A RECOMMENDED OPPOSE POSITION ON THIS BILL. SARAH MUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS IN OPPOSITION. RON RAPOPORT HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE ALSO TAKING IN OPPOSE RECOMMENDATION TO OUR CONVENTION. KAI JACKSON WAS SENDING UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION. SIR HUTCHINSON WITHOUT FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS AND VICE IDEA WE OPPOSE THIS BILL. ANY BLOOMBERG ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION AND WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNED WITH BEING INCLUDED IN THE BILL AND THE FISCAL IMPACT. ERNIE SILVA SCIENTIFIC CHARTER SCHOOL WE WILL ALSO BE TAKING THE POST POSITION.% THANK YOU SEE NO OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. I MANY COMMENTS ON THE COMMITTEE. I I HAVE A COMMENT. I THINK A BILL. AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU WANT PEACE OFFICERS. NOT IN A GUARD THEY MIGHT'VE GONE THROUGH TWO WEEK EIGHT THIRTY TWO CLASS WHICH THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING SOME IS TRAINED IN THE AREA OF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I THINK YOU'RE NOT ASKING THESE OFFICERS IN IRAQ THE STUDENTS AS FAR AS DISCIPLINE THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE SEEKING HERE. YOU'RE SEEKING SIMPLY TO KEEP THE FACILITY IN THE PEOPLE IN AND AROUND THAT FACILITY SAFE. AND AS ONE OF COMES FROM. HIGH SCHOOL A FIFTY TWO HUNDRED KIDS. OKAY WITH TWO SHERIFF'S. USUALLY. ON CAMPUS ON AROUND IT'S ALSO AROUND IN THIS AFTER SCHOOL HOURS I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS. IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD THAT EXPERIENCE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MASSIVE PEOPLE. AND THE ACTIVITY SURROUNDING VERY URBAN HIGH SCHOOL YOU MIGHT THE YOU KNOW AFRAID OF THIS CONCEPT BUT IF YOU'VE INTERACTED AND SEEN THIS LIVE DID. I THINK HE'D BE MUCH MORE SUPPORTIVE. AND ANY FIFTY TWO HUNDRED YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL FIFTY TWO HUNDRED IS A SMALL CITY. SMALL CITIES HAVE POLICE OFFICERS TO. FOR THE VERY SAME REASON SO I AM SUPPORTIVE I THINK THERE ARE OTHERS WHO WISH TO COMMENT MISTER THURMAN. NO MISTER LACKEY I'M SORRY. SELECT ANY JEWISH. OKAY LIKE A SUBHEADING GO. I WANT TO. THANK THE AUTHOR FOREVER THE COURAGE TO BRING THIS FORWARD AT THIS VERY DELICATE TIME. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY VERY DISTURBING PROBLEM IN OUR SOCIETY. AND OTHER REMEDIES ART ALL THAT SIMPLE. BUT ONE THING THAT I THINK IS TO SHOULD RESONATE VERY CLEARLY. AS IT IS NOT OKAY TO LEAVE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. DEFENSELESS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE. WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD WELL INTENDED POLICIES. WITHIN OUR STATE AND WITHIN LOCAL CONTROL. BUT ONE THING CLEARLY. NOT OKAY TO LEAVE. A BODY OF CHILDREN. THAT HAVE BEEN INTERESTED. DEFENSELESS. AND I THINK. THIS IS A REASONABLE. POINTED THERE'D BEEN A LOT OF PROPOSALS AND I THINK. THIS ONE SHOULD RESONATE IN. HAD TO SAY THAT. SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN GIVEN. THE. THE PRIVILEGE TO POSSIBLY BEEN SACRIFICE THEIR LIFE. FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS AS A THREAT. TO THEM AS. UNIMAGINABLE TO ME. SO I'VE I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I THINK IT MAKES. GOOD COMMON SENSE BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. THANK YOU. I MISTER DURBIN. I AM SUCH YEAR UMP TO THE AUTHOR I'D JUST WANT SOME CLARIFICATION BECAUSE AS WE DISCUSS THIS BILL. YOU SHARED WITH ME THAT YOUR BILL WOULD. REQUIRE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS SAID THEY'RE STILL LANGUAGE HERE AND REFERENCES. TO ARMED SECURITY GUARDS ALLOW I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR THE WORK THAT THOSE WHO WERE IN ARMY SECURITY. AGENCIES DO ARM I HAVE WORKED FOR MANY YEARS WAS SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND. I I HAVE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF COMFORT. WITH THOSE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS WHO HAVE WORKED WITH ON BECAUSE I HAVE EXPERIENCED THEM. TO. UNDERSTAND THAT FIRST THING THEY DO IS BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH STUDENTS. TO DO PREVENTIVE WORK THAT THEY CAN AND THEN WHEN THERE IS A SITUATION LIKE WHEN A CHILD. CALLS THEIR PARA AND SAYS DAD. OUR SCHOOLS UNDER LOCKDOWN BECAUSE WE HAVE A GUN ON CAMPUS I RECEIVED A CALL. AT YALE. A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER KNOWS HOW TO GO FROM BEING A PREVENTIVE OFFICER. TWO BEING A IN A LAW ENFORCEMENT SAFETY UP RESPONSE AND SO. BUT I'D BE CONCERNED IF WERE TALKING ABOUT OPENING IT UP TO US THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF TRAINING. OF A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO MANY VARIABLES THAT CAN HAPPEN IN HAVE HAPPENED YOU KNOW THE KIDS HAVE BEEN. MISTREATED AND ALL NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE OF IMPROVISED. AND WE KNOW THAT SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS CAN NEVER BE USED. AS THE DISCIPLINE AREAS FOR. WHAT STUDENTS DO KIDS ARE GONNA DO WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO? AND SO I AS I SHARE WITH YOU ARE IF THIS IS A BILL TO PUT GUNS ON CAMPUS IN A WAY THAT. COULD REALLY OPEN THE STUFF FOR A RECKLESS BEHAVIOR OR MISINTERPRETATION OR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T HAD THE PROPER TRAINING. BEING ASKED TO DEFEND THE SITUATION THAT COULD GET EVEN WORSE I WILL SUPPORT IT. NOT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CUTE SCHOOL RESOURCE PATTERSON ONLY. WHO HAD THE PROPER TRAINING? WHERE THERE IS A PROPER OVERSIGHT WHERE THEY WILL NOT BE AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL BE USED OR MISUSED? THE B. THE DEANS OF THE DISCIPLINARIAN SUBSTANTIVE BEHAVIOR ON CAMPUS THAT I THINK WE HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH HAPPY WOULD YOU PLEASE CLARIFY. YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER THURMOND AND. I AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD ABOUT THIS BILL AND AND AND YOUR EXPERIENCE. YOU HAVE BEEN WORKED ON THE SCHOOLS AND WORKED WITH. JUSTIN RESOURCE OFFICERS A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS WAS WAS VERY APPARENT TO ME. JUST SO YOU KNOW WE ARE TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT. THAT WOULD REMOVE PRIVATE SECURITY FROM BEING PART OF THIS IS WOULD ONLY BE. SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS. PIECE ORIGINALLY WHEN I DID THAT I MEAN THERE ARE SOME PRIVATE SECURITY FIRMS OUT THERE WHO HAVE. THE ADDITIONAL TRAINING. BUT I HEARD THE CONCERN. THAT WE WANT SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT IT WOULD ONLY BE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS IN THIS IN THIS BILL THANKS FOR CLARIFICATION FIFTEEN AMENDMENT THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THERE MISTER CHAIR. ON THAT WOULD YOU SPEAK TO THE OTHER KEY PROVISIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE PEOPLE. WHO HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THIS COULD TURN INTO EVEN WITH IT BEING SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS IN? THERE HAVE BEEN MISS USES AND ABUSES OF SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. THAT HAVE LED TO CHILDREN BEING CRIMINALIZE FOR CARRYING OUT THE BEHAVIORS THAT KIDS CARRY OUT. I GUESS I'M ASKING YOU TO SPEAK TO HOW. WE ARE STRUCTURING THIS SO THAT THOSE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN TRAINING AND EXPECTATION SO THAT THESE ARE NOT OFFICER IS BEING USED TO TAKE OVER WHAT SHOULD BE. WORK DONE BY THE SCHOOL STAFF TO ADDRESS STUDENT BEHAVIOR. I KNOW I'M DEFINITELY SENSITIVE TO THOSE CONCERNS. AND YOU KNOW ONE THING IS THERE IS SOURCE OFFICER IT'S MORE THAN JUST BEING A PEACE OFFICER IT'S MORE THAN JUST HAVING POST TRAINING. THERE'S ADDITIONAL TRADE ON TOP OF THAT THAT GOES INTO HOW YOU ENGAGE WITH STUDENTS. IN ORDER TO BECOME AN ACTUAL SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER SO THERE IS THAT ADDITIONAL TRAINING HERE. YA AS WITH ALL. YOU KNOW KIND OF BIG BILLS LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I'M STILL WANTING TO WORK WITH ALL THE STAKE HOLDERS ON THIS. TO MAKE SURE IT ADDRESSES ALL THOSE DIFFERENT CONCERNS. YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD YOU KNOW SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT IS THERE MAYBE SCHOOLS THAT ALREADY HAVE THE RESOURCE OFFICER OR. YOU HAVE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS MAY BE IS THERE AN OPT OUT KNEW THAT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DISCUSS. YOU AS WE MOVE FOR BUT I'D I DEFTLY INSENSITIVE TO THOSE ISSUES YOU WANT TO ENSURE THAT. THAT THIS PERSON IS IN A PLACE OF OF OF OBVIOUSLY FIRST FIRST ALL DEFENSIVE THE SCHOOL IF THERE IS SOME SORT OF THREAT. BUT ALSO AS A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP. WITH THE KIDS ON THE CAMPUS AND. YOU KNOW FOR THERE IS A GREAT ARTICLE IN MY LOCAL PAPER JUST RECENTLY ABOUT A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER MARYSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL. AND HOW HIS IN HIS ENGAGEMENT ON CAMPUSES HAD A VERY POSITIVE. ENVIRONMENT FOR THE ENTIRE CAMPUS AND I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN RICHMOND AS WELLSO. WERE DEFTLY WANTED TO ENGAGE ON THAT AND AGAIN THIS IS IN THE FINAL PRODUCT AS WELL AS REMOVAL FOR WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND I'M. WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU SO. EDU WELL I I TO YOUR POINT YOU KNOW NOT BEING A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER IS NOT THE JOB FOR EVERY OFFICER. ARE THERE ARE SOME OFFICERS WHO DON'T WANT TO WORKING ENVIRONMENT. THAT IS PREVENTION FIRST LAW ENFORCEMENT SECOND BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP WITH STUDENTS AND. THE LEVEL PREVENTIVE STUFF THAT CAN HAPPEN AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR APPROACH TO THIS I DO THINK THAT THERE'S AN ELF IN THE ROOM THAT'S GOT TO GET DRESSED AND THAT IS. THAT HISTORICALLY THEIR DISCIPLINE BAD RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT KIDS OF COLOR AND OTHERS. AND THERE'S A HUGE LEVEL DISTRESS I THINK WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT WE DO OURSELVES IN A JUSTICE IN A DISSERVICE. AND SO IN THAT RESPECT I'M ASKING YOU AS YOU OFFER THE BILL WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TO BUILD IN THE KIND OF OVERSIGHT. ACCOUNTABILITY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT YOU INTEND WHAT I HEAR YOU SAY YOU INTEND TO BUILD. GETS BUILT IN A WAY THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE HISTORICAL. DISPROPORTIONATE AND NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SOME COMMUNITIES. THE KIDS OF COLOR AND KIDS FROM CERTAIN BACKGROUNDS WHAT WILL WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T OPEN THE DOOR. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS POLICE OFFICERS TO. CRIMINALIZE KIDS MYSTERY KIDS ARM IN THE WAYS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN SOME SITUATIONS. WELL FIRST WORDS A LOOK I I WANNA. SIT DOWN WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ENGAGE WITH THEM AND HEAR WHAT THEY'RE. WHAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT IDEAS ARE? OPEN YOU KNOW TWO SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE ENSURE THAT AND AND HOW WE BUILD IN THAT ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM ON THAT OR. IS THERE MAY BE SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING. KNOW AT THIS POINT A TIME WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ONE. ONE SRO THAT PER CAMPUS RIGHT NOW I'M SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MULTIPLE. PEOPLE. DOOR TALKING AT LEAST ONE PERSON. AND YOU LOOK WITH AS WE MOVE FORWARD I WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AND I'M OPEN TO TO DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE HOW WE DO THAT I'LL BE LOOKING FOR THAT I THINK THERE HAS TO BE. THAT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT. IN ACCOUNTABILITY. SO THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE TRUST IN THE FAITH AT THIS TO WORK CAN NO THERE ARE STRUCTURES. TO HELP IT TO WORK NOW IF THEY WERE IF IT WORKS IT WORKS IN WHAT I HOPE HAPPENS THIS STRONG RELATIONSHIPS GET BUILT. MY CAN COMMUNITY POLICING WERE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS GET BUILT BUT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS I THINK THERE'S A FAIR EXPECTATION THAT THERE SHOULD BE BUILT IN STRUCTURES. TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE OVER SITES TO PROTECT AGAINST ABUSE MISUSE THAT RESULTED OF CRIMINALIZATION OF CHILDREN. THE MISTREATMENT OF CHILDREN OR THE HARM OF CHILDREN. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO REITERATE FOR MY OWN CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE I HAVE NOT SEEN THE OFFICERS AROUND CAMP. ENGAGE IN STUDENT DISCIPLINE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S YOUR GOAL EITHER I APPRECIATE MR BEHRENS COMMENTS WITH ME ABOUT WE BUILD THAT WALL. STATUTORILY I DON'T KNOW BUT I IN APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD. AND I ALSO THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AN OFFICE ON CAMPUS AND BUILD RELATIONSHIPS. WITH STUDENTS ARE A SO THAT THERE IS THAT TRUST. GAIN OR REGAIN SO I APPRECIATE WHERE WERE ALL OF US ARE COMING FROM WITH THAT. YOU MAY CLOSE ALRIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME ON THIS NOW TO SET RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE GREAT. THANK YOU COULD YOU COULD SECRETARY PLEASE PLUS W. OR.

FOUR VOTES TO THOSE OF THE BILL AS IT HAS FOR VOTES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PATTERSON. THAT WE'RE GONNA MISS A GONZALEZ FLETCHER ITEM NUMBER FIVE. AND YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS A. B. NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WOULD PREVENT SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM TAKING PUNITIVE ACTION AGAINST A STUDENT FOR HAVING DEBT TO THE SCHOOL. AND FROM USING A DEBT COLLECTOR WHEN ATTEMPTING COLLECT DEBT OWNED BY A PARENT OR GUARDIAN. INCREASINGLY FAMILIES EXPECTED PAY MORE OUT OF THEIR POCKETS IN ORDER FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO PARTICIPATE IN SCHOOL. WHEN FAMILIES LACK THE RESOURCES TO TOOK PUNITIVE MEASURES AGAINST STUDENTS FOR DEBT THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE CONTROL OVER. DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO DENY HONOR CERTIFICATES TRANSCRIPTS AND DIPLOMAS PARTICIPATION GRADUATION CEREMONIES AND PARTICIPATION IN FIELD TRIPS. THESE EXCLUSIONS ULTIMATELY RESULT IN DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT WHICH CAN AFFECT A SINCE ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE BETTER SOCIAL WELL BEING. IN ONE EXAMPLE OF ACTION TAKEN AGAINST A STUDENT A CHARTER SCHOOL IN EAST OAKLAND WOULD PROVIDE HONORABLE STUDENTS A CERTIFICATE THAT INCLUDED A WATER MARK THAT READ DEBT OWED IF THEIR PARENT OWED EVEN THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF MONEY. IN ADDITION TO TAKING ACTION AGAINST PUPILS SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS HAVE TURNED. TO SENDING FAMILIES TO DEBT COLLECTORS WHICH WILL FOREVER AFFECT THEIR CREDIT RATING. THAT WAS HAPPENING IN SAN DIEGO ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THAT THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS SINCE STOPPED THAT ACTION AND HAVE. VOTED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE IN THOSE ACTIONS ONLY PERPETUATE A FAMILY'S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. WHEN PARENTS LACK THE RESOURCES TO PAY SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS TO WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH PARENTS RATHER THAN ACT LIKE A LOAN PROVIDER IN SENDING FAMILIES TO COLLECTIONS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY I HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHELLE SOLVE OUR VINCE HE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA AND WERE PLEASE TO SPONSOR THIS BILL. CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES EVERY CHILD A FREE PUBLIC EDUCATION BUT ASK ANY PARENT IN CALIFORNIA THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT PUBLIC SCHOOL ATTENDANCE IS OFTEN ANYTHING BUT FREE. FROM BUS RIDES TO UNIFORMS TO SCHOOL SUPPLIES TO LOSS BOOKS PARENTS WHO LACK THE RESOURCES TO KEEP UP WITH THE BILLS ARE HAVE INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES TO GO INTO DEBT WITH THE SCHOOL. NO CHILD SHOULD BE BURDEN FROM BECAUSE OF THEIR PARENTS UNPAID SCHOOL ME. SCHOOL THAT. SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS TAKE DIRECT ACTION AGAINST THE STUDENT WHEN THE PARENT ó STAFF DID NINE TRANSCRIPTS OR FOR CERTIFICATES DENYING ACCESS TO THE LIBRARY. BENNY PARTICIPATION IN THE GRADUATION CEREMONY OR ACCESS TO FIELD TRIPS. FOR INSTANCE AN ADVOCATE SHARED STORY OF MARIO A STUDENT SAN DIEGO WHO'D BEEN IN SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR MOST OF THE SCHOOLING BEFORE GOING INTO A TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM FOR HIS SENIOR YEAR. HE WAS EXCITED ABOUT HIS GRADUATION CEREMONY AND THEN GOT A SENIOR DEBT LIST A WEEK BEFORE THE CEREMONY THAT LIST A MISSING FOURTH GRADE BOOK. IN THE SCHOOL TOLD HIM THAT HE COULDN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE CEREMONY UNLESS HE PAID THOSE STATS HE WAS HEARTBROKEN. BECAUSE IT WORKS SO HARD TO GET THERE. CHILDREN SHOULD SIMPLY NOT BE USED AS A TOOL FOR GOT COLLECTION OR SHAMED OR MARGINALIZED FROM SCHOOL ACTIVITIES BECAUSE OF HER PARENTS INABILITY OR UNWILLINGNESS TO PAY IT THAT. THAT ADVERSE ACTION TOWARD STUDENTS CONTRIBUTES TO AN HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. FURTHERMORE THIRD PARTY DEBT COLLECTION FOR SCHOOL DEBTS MAY ACTUALLY VIOLATE CHILD PRIVACY LAWS. THE FAMILY EDUCATION RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT PURPOSE. GENERALLY PROHIBITS SCHOOLS FROM SHARING INFORMATION ABOUT ABOUT CHILDREN WITHOUT RID WRITTEN CONSENT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT SHARING A STUDENTS INFORMATION WITH A THIRD PARTY DEBT COLLECTOR. ACTUALLY COMPLIES WITH FOR ABOUT. AB NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WILL PREVENT CHILDREN FROM BEING BROUGHT INTO THE PRIVATE DEBT PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND A PARENT OR GUARDIAN. THE BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT SCHOOLS ABSORB ALL OF THE DAY UNPAID FEES OR STOP COLLECTING DATA. IT SIMPLY PROHIBIT SCHOOLS FROM USING CHILDREN. AS A AS A MEANS TO COLLECT THOSE DEBTS OR SHARING INFORMATION ABOUT THAT CHILD WITH THIRD PARTY DEBT COLLECTORS. OUR CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE USES IT AS TOOLS FOR DEBT COLLECTION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. THE RIGHT TO A FREE EDUCATION IS ENSHRINED IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THAT RIGHT IS NOT CONTINGENT ON THE STUDENTS OR FAMILY'S ABILITY TO PAY FEES. DENYING A STUDENT THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE GRADES ARE TRANSCRIPTS TO TAKE PART OF SCHOOL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FIELD TRIPS OR EVEN TO PARTICIPATE IN GRADUATION CEREMONY BECAUSE THE FAMILY HAS UNPAID FEES IS QUITE SIMPLY A DENIAL OF THAT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. SUCH ACTIONS ARE ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO AREBURDENED WITH BOTH THE SHAME OF HAVING THEIR PEERS KNOW ABOUT THEIR STRUGGLES. BECAUSE ALL OF THE STEPS ARE THINGS THAT OTHER STUDENTS ARE EASILY GOING TO BE ABLE TO OBSERVE. AND BARRIERS TO GETTING THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE WHEN THE SCHOOLS TAKE ACTION AGAINST THEM BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY'S UNPAID FEES. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS COMMITTED TO EQUITY IN ITS SYSTEM OF PUBLIC EDUCATION BUT A SCHOOL TAKING NEGATIVE ACTION AGAINST A STUDENT BECAUSE THE PARENTS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PAY FEES IS NOT EQUITABLE. IT HARM STUDENTS FROM LOWER INCOME FAMILIES WHILE STUDENTS FROM HIGHER INCOMES FAMILIES HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT OF ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS TO A FREE EDUCATION AND TO PROTECT EDUCATIONAL EQUITY IN OUR STATE WE ASK THAT YOU VOTE YES ON AB NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR. THANK YOU THE CLARIFY THE AMENDMENTS HONOR THE EGGS OF THE BILL'S PROVISIONS FOR DEBT OWED DUE TO VANDALISM. OR LOS WILFUL DAMAGE TO SCHOOL PROPERTY. THOSE ARE THE ONES WE DISCUSSED TODAY. THOSE AMENDMENTS WE DISCOVERED LATER TODAY I I WOULD LIKE TO. WE WILL NOT RENEGOTIATE THEM NOW. THAT'S FINE NOT IT'S I I KNOW YOU WANT YOU WANT TO WORK ON THIS BILL FURTHER I KNOW THE YOUR I ONE OF OUR MOTHERS WILL FURTHER I WANT TO CLARIFY ONE THING THAT I WAS CONCERNED WITH. VANDALISM YES WILLFUL. LOSS YES BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT HOMELESS STUDENTS WHO MAY LOSE TEXTBOOKS BECAUSE OF DISPLACEMENT OF THEIR OWN WHEN WE DO THIS WHEN WE HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. YEAH I'M AND THAT'S WHAT I DON'T THINK IT'S HARD TO GET. TO KNOW TO EXACTLY I THINK IT'S A VERY SMALL. PERCENTAGE BUT WE HAVE NO RECORD NINE TO SEE IF THERE WAS SOME CONVERSATION HAD TODAY WAS LIKE THIS IS PRETTY NAILED DOWN NO IT IS ONLY NOW DOWN TO BE GOING BACK ON THAT PATH YOU KNOW. THESE SMALL AYE AYE AYE AYE I DON'T. UNFORTUNATELY THINK FIRST OF A HOMELESS STUDENT WHO MAYBE GETS DISPLACED SIX TIMES DURING A SCHOOL THAT IS A LEGITIMATE CONCERN SOAPS AWAY WILL CONTEMPLATE THAT'S WILL CONTEMPLATE THAT ACCEPT AMENDMENTS HAS RIGHT NOW. BINGO THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. OF MY CARE WITH WESTERN CENTER LAW POVERTY IN SUPPORT OF. LARA PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS I'M WITH THE AMENDMENT STATES AS I THINK I UNDERSTAND THEM. WE ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. IN SUPPORT THOUGH. SHUT OFF. IT I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I KNOW THAT I DO HAVE SOME FURTHER IN SUPPORT YES OKAY COUNTY QUICKLY DANIELLE CANNOT KAISER ON BEHALF OF COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION IN STRONG SUPPORT THINK. SAY NO THERE'S IN SUPPORT AGAIN APPEARED HERE IN SUPPORT. OF THESE LOSE BROWN JUNIOR ON BEHALF OF POLICY MAKING THE LINES FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU OKAY AYE THOSE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CLIFF WE'RE HERE WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS. I HAVE TO SAY MY CLIENT IS SYMPATHETIC TO THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR AND TO MOST OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. ARM AND WE'RE IN CONVERSATION WORKING WITH HER ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT APPROACH. CURRENTLY IS THE IS THE BILL IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN A CONTAINS A COMPLETE. BAN ON A SCHOOL JUST YOUR SCHOOL CONTRACTING WITH A COLLECTION AGENCY WE THINK THAT IS OVER BROAD AND IS NOT EXACTLY THE RIGHT APPROACH YOU KNOW. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN TRYING TO DRILL DOWN I'M REALLY FOCUSING ON WHAT AREAS ARE A PROBLEM BUT. THE APPROACH OF. IN ESSENCE COOLEY BANNING A RELATIONSHIP WITH WILL LEGAL BUSINESSES WHEN CERTAIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT. AS WELL AS FULL IN THE NEED TO FOCUS ON SPECIFIC. PROBLEM AREAS I THINK. WE'RE CERTAINLY SYMPATHETIC TO PROTECT. NEW RESEARCH PROBLEMATIC PRACTICES BUT AT THIS TIME WE ARE OPPOSED. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION SARAH BOTCHES WITH KASBAH WE HAD AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED DUE TO THE CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT RECONSIDERING OUR POSITION. SINGLE MOTHERS FURTHER OPPOSITION. BEHIND THE RAIL ANY COMMENTS. MR MCCARTY SURE I'D CAME IN A BIT LATE BUT I I SUPPORT THE BELT MOVE THE BILL RIGHT NOW. BEGIN WITH THE MEMBER I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU SO. I I THINK IT'S IT'S UP I THINK THE BELIEF OF MANY OF US THAT WE DON'T WANT TO. PENALIZE BEING POOR THAT'S WHY WE DID THAT YOU KNOW THAT SHAMING FOR SCHOOL LUNCHES LAST YEAR. AND IN THIS BILL IN THE STORIES THAT YOU YOU BRING UP FROM YOUR. ON AREAS SAN DIEGO. I THINK PROVIDERS POWERFUL EXAMPLES THAT WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW HARM PEOPLE CORRECTIVE FOR FOR BEING POOR. BUT YEAH  <u><c.green>THAT THERE ARE</c></u> HYPOTHETICALS AND I KNOW WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THIS WHERE. YET MAYBE INDIVIDUAL. THAT JUST DOESN'T WANT TO PAY THEIR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM AND THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY. A INCOME BRACKET WERE YOU KNOW POVERTY RISES THAT MAYBE THERE ARE SOME OUT LIARS AND SO ARE THERE ANY EXAMPLES WHERE WE'RE COLLECTION WOULD BE APPROPRIATE POTENTIALLY. FOR IT FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT. INSIDE JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW ASK YOU YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. I UNDERSTAND AND I'VE HEARD HYPOTHETICALS ABOUT STUDENTS AND DRONES AND RICH AREAS IN PARENTS NOT WANTING TO PAY FOR. DRUMS WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW WERE BEING USED BY SCHOOLS. AS FAR AS AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM AND AND. THAT COULD BE UNIQUE IN NOT SOMETHING WE WANT TO WORK ON. OFTEN. SOMETIMES IT'S A THIRD PARTY OPERATING THAT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM AND SO THE THIRD PARTY MIGHT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PARENT. SEPARATELY CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY COULD STILL PURSUE. IF IT'S BEING DONE THROUGH THE SCHOOL BY ALL MEANS A SCHOOL COULD AND IT'S AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM I I THINK WE DID INTEND TO SAY THAT. THAT CHILDREN WHO OTHERWISE COULDN'T QUALIFY FOR FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICES COULD CONTINUE TO ATTEND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WITHOUT PAIN. THOSE THOSE ARE USUALLY STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT YOU GET BILL DINNER AND A SYSTEMATIC. TIME FRAME AND IF YOU. OUR CONTINUED IF YOU'RE NOT PAYING YOUR BILL COULD NOT UTILIZE SOMETHING THAT IS EXTRA BEYOND THE SCHOOL DAY. I'M SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS AVAILABLE MY CONCERN IS. IS WRITING HUGE EXEMPTIONS RIGHT BECAUSE. YOU KNOW WE STARTED THIS WITH WITH THE FACT THAT. DEBT COLLECTORS WERE BEING USED AND FOUND OUT LATER BY A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT THE THEY WERE ACTUALLY GETTING BACK. AND THEY WERE LOSING MONEY USING A DEBT COLLECTOR IT WAS THE THREAT OF THE QUESTION AND IN MEANTIME RUNNING PEOPLE'S CREDIT NAM. AND THOSE WERE MAINLY. MIDDLE CLASS OR MIDDLE CLASS STUDENTS TO A MAIN I'VE BEEN FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH PROGRAM BEGINNING YEAR AND THEN BECOME. APPARENTLY IS IS A JOB OR HAS A DIFFERENT SITUATION. SO I IF THERE'S SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE CAN RIDE INTO PROTECT. TO PROTECT SCHOOLS FROM RICH PARENTS WHO JUST DON'T WANNA PAY BILLS ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO THAT I KNOW AND TENSION DID I HAVE. YOU KNOW. AS A BILL TO ALLOW. PEOPLE TO CIRCUMVENT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. SO WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS ON THAT. THANK YOU AND MAYBE THE PLACE TO GO IS HAVE THE STATE BACK FROM THOSE DOLLARS ASSOCIATE WITH THE LOS. IF WE'RE SAYING YOU CAN'T COLLECT ON THAT. AND AGAIN FOR FREE REDUCED AYE AYE THEY ARE PROBABLY ALREADY EXEMPT MANY CASES YEAH. SO DOES A CONVERSATIONS WE CAN HAVE DOWN THERE ARE RATHER THAN HAVING A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER AT EVERY SCHOOL. THAT'S A DIFFERENT BILL I DIDN'T SEE YOU CAN ASK. I DON'T KNOW THAT SEEMS REALLY EXPENSIVE TO I THINK I WAS A CO AUTHOR. BUT I'M MISTER BECAUSE THAT THE REPORTER FROM THE APPROACH HERE. YOU KILEY HANNAH. I'M SURE MANY QUESTIONS. OKAY BACK TO BACK TO THIS BILL I'M SAID THE CHAIR I HAD JUST DIED ACTION BROUGHT UP THE POINT I WAS GOING TO RAISE. LOOKING AT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS LOOKS LIKE. LOCATE INCOME. FAMILIES ARE ALREADY EXEMPT FROM A LOT OF THESE FEES SO I'D WHY IS THIS BILL NECESSARILY A PRIORITY AND. THE AUTHOR FOR THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WHEN. IT'S NOT JUST THE PEACE FIRST OF ALL AND AND. TICKETS TO BE. CLEAR IT'S NOT JUST FEES ADD IN WERE TALKING IN SPECIFICALLY ABOUT BY SEEN YES ON ON BY SEEN FREE AND REDUCED. LUNCH SOME CHILDREN WHO FALL UNDER THAT CATEGORY OFTEN ARE COVERED BUT YOU HAVE SITUATIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THAT. A CHILD TO ME START OFF THE YEAR ANY. WITH PARENTS IN A FINANCIAL POSITION WHERE THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THAT THINGS CAN CHANGE. AND WE SEE THAT A LOT. SITUATIONS CHANGE. BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE BY SEEN ASPECT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WERE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE STAMP GREEN AYE AYE CHILD'S AYE DIPLOMA ARE NOT GIVING EACH HOW DIPLOMA BECAUSE OF THE DEBTS OF THEIR PARENTS. THERE SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR ABOUT THAT IT IS NOT THE CHILD'S FAULT WE SHOULD NOT PENALIZE A CHILD. FOR HAVING AYE IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'RE THEIR PARENTS ARE NOT POOR. HAVING HAVING PARENTS WERE UNWILLING TO PAY FOR SOMETHING IN EDUCATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE FREE. AND SO WE JUST WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE CHILD IS LEFT HARMLESS. IN ANY KIND OF SITUATION BY WHICH THE PARENTS RESPONSIBLE THAT'S WHY WE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENT ON THINGS LIKE VANDALIZE SCHOOL BOOKS RIGHT THAT IS A SITUATION. BY WHICH MOST OF THE TIME AT THE CHILD IS NOT THE PART OF THE CHILD IS IN FACT. THE PERSON WHO COSTS. FOR THAT KIND OF THE THE OTHER PART OF THE. THE DECK DO KNOWN PRACTICE WHAT WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS HOW SCHOOLS ARE. IS THAT ARE THEY ARE MOST THEN USING THAT COLLECTORS ARE TO. I HAVE SO. WE FOUND WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THAT MOST WERE NOT USING DEBT COLLECTORS IN AND SAN DIEGO WAS A. UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE AND HAVE SENT STANDING UPRIGHT HAS SINCE STOPPED THAT PRACTICE. HOWEVER I IN FURTHER REVIEW IN FACT MEETING WITH THE OPPONENTS AND WE FOUND THAT IN FACT SOME RURAL SCHOOLS USE THAT KIND OF CONTRACT WITH DEBT COLLECTORS IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THEIR NORMAL. JUST COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SO THAT'S WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH. TO USE A THIRD PARTY YOU OUTSOURCE. COLLECTING JUST LIKE THINGS THAT. ARE RIGHTFULLY BEING CHARGED. AND WE WON ENSURE. THAT THAT COULD BE DONE IN A WAY THAT THAT DOESN'T VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW. BUT ALSO DOESN'T PUT PEOPLE'S. CREDIT AT JEOPARDY. CREDIT SCORE. I SEE SO THAT'S AN ALTERNATIVE YOU'D ACTUALLY. THE OPEN TO. IF WE CAN DO IT WHERE DOESN'T VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS SIMPLY. I I HATE THAT THERE OUTSOURCING BUT THEY HAVE TO CONTRACT WITH A THIRD PARTY IN ORDER TO DO KIND OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT A SCHOOL THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M TRYING TO PREVENT SO WHAT THAT OFTEN THAT. COPYRIGHT. WISE ONE OKAY AND OTHER NON. THE ACTINS OF A DEBT WELL WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN SAN DIEGO WAS A TRADITIONAL DEBT COLLECTION SITUATION WHERE THEIR CONTRACT AFTER TRYING TO. RECEIVE THE PAYMENT FROM THE PARENT. THEY SENT IT TO A DEBT COLLECTOR I'VE SOLD IT FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR THEY IN FACT LOST MONEY BY DOING THIS AND. AND AS A RESULT THE DEBT COLLECTORS WORKED. ARE. I DON'T WANNA OFFEND ANYONE'S BUSINESS BUT. I PURSUED THE DEBT. IN A WAY THAT'S TRADITIONAL LIKE ANY OTHER DEBT IN EVENTUALLY LEADING TO PEOPLE'S AYE CREDIT SCORE BEING RENT. SO YOU IT SEEMS LIKE THE CONCERN IS WITH THE CREDIT MOSTLY ON AND YOUR AND. THAT WILL TAKE A HIT IF YOU GO TO REGISTER OFFICIAL DEBT COLLECTOR BUT SOME OF THE THIRD PARTY WHOSE. ACTUALLY COLLECTING THAT'S MAYBE THAT WON'T HAPPEN WHAT EVEN THE SCHOOLS DO WRITE A SCHOOL DOESN'T JUST SEND YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR THEY HAVE A FORM OF OF ALERTING PARENTS THAT YOU OWE SOMETHING RIGHT. AND SOME SCHOOLS YOU NOW AND I'VE. FORGOTTEN TO PAY SOMETHING ONCE AND GOTTEN SIXTEEN EMAILS FROM THE SPORTS I COME IN AND PAY IT MOUNTS NORMAL ACTIVITY THAT HAPPENS I THINK IT'S SCHOOLS AND. OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE LARGE ENOUGH SCHOOL. YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT WITHIN YOUR OWN ACCOUNTING SYSTEM I I DO FEEL I FEEL I I I UNDERSTAND IF IT'S A SMALL WORLD SCHOOL ARE A SMALL SCHOOL CAN'T PROVIDE FOR A POSITION THAT DOES THAT THAT THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. YEAH I GUESS SO I'M. I'M. STILL A LITTLE UNCLEAR AND I YOU KNOW. WHETHER YOU'RE IS CATEGORICALLY OPPOSED TO THIS TAKE YOUR INDUSTRY TO HAVING ANY ROLE IN THE PROCESS BY WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR THIRD PARTIES TO. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT A BY WE ARE ABIDING BY FEDERAL LAW FOR SO LONG YOU KNOW AND MAKING SURE WE'RE NOT GIVING AWAY THAT STUDENTS INFORMATION. BUT I AM NOT OPPOSED TO PEOPLE COLLECTING WHAT IS OWED I AM OPPOSED TO ROUTINE. YOU KNOW COAXES AS. CREDIT SCORE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE UNATTAINABLE SOLICIT SITUATION AND ARE PAYING FOR SOMETHING QUITE FRANKLY THAT I THINK WE'RE DOING A DISSERVICE TO MOST PARENTS BY NOT. PROVIDING FOR FREE. CAN I CAN I ASK WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE ANSWER MAYBE THE OPPOSITION URBAN SUPPORTERS WILL NOT. IS IS GOVERNMENT DEBT WHEN IT GOES TO A COLLECTION AGENCY DOES IT IMPACT YOUR CREDIT SCORE. IT I THOUGHT ADDITIONALLY DOES NOT THERE'S AN EXCEPTION BUT IT WITH THAT IF YOU USE AN INDEPENDENT LIKE THE BUS SERVICE THAT IN SAN DIEGO IT DEAD SO THAT THE PARENTS WHO SPOKE OUT. NAKAI CLIPPER BACK. I THINK THE ANSWER. WOULD BE THAT YOU TO CLOSE THE KIND OF GOVERNMENT DEBT SO THERE IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NATIONAL ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ASSOCIATION. DEBT COLLECTION IN THE CREDIT BUREAUS THAT CERTAIN TIE KINDS OF GOVERNMENT DEBT SUCH AS PENALTIES AND FEES ARE NOT REPORTABLE. ARM ON CREDITS. OTHER KINDS OF THAT ARE ACTUALLY CONTRACTUAL. AGREEMENTS WERE YOU AGREED WITH A GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO ACCEPT THE SERVICE IN RETURN JUST LIKE ANY NORMAL PRIVATE TRANSACTION WOULD BE REPORTABLE I THINK HOWEVER IN THE CASE OF. ON THE SCHOOL DEBT SITUATION THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE AUTHOR ABOUTS NAM CERTAINLY WE ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH HER IN TRYING TO. ADDRESS HER CONCERNS ABOUT CREDIT REPORTING OVER THESE KINDS OF EDUCATION ALL EXPENSES THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW CLEARLY FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY OF AREAS OF EQUAL EDUCATION. AND PROTECTING STUDENTS AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND FAMILIES FROM HAVING THEIR CREDIT SCORES IN ANYWAY. AFFECTED BY NORTON WHAT WOULD BE NORMAL COLLECTION ACTIVITIES EVEN THOSE CONTRACTUAL SO WE'RE HOPING TO WORK WITH THEIR AND I'M WRITING THE RIGHT LANGUAGE TO COVER THE SITUATIONS IN THIS. IN THIS INSTANCE BUT YEAH THERE ARE BROAD LIMITS CERTAIN KINDS OF GOVERNMENT DEBT IS. REPORTABLE SOME SOME ISN'T I WOULD ALSO JUST ADD JUST FOR THE RECORD. THE COLLECTION INDUSTRY WHICH REPRESENTS BANKS AND HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS HOUSE TO ABIDE BY ALL OF THE PRIVACY LAWS IN OUR COUNTRY WHETHER IT'S HIP ARE. WHETHER IT'S FINANCIAL PRIVACY AND THEY CERTAINLY ARE GOING AGREE AND IT'S PART OF THEIR YOU KNOW BOTH LEGAL WORK RESPONSIBILITY IN THAT WOULD BE SUED AT THE GAZOO BUT THE VIOLATE ANYBODY'S PRIVACY RIGHTS AND TO REJECT IN THE EDUCATION AREA. THAT'S COMPLY WITH ALL THAT IN THE IN THE HEALTHCARE IN THE FINANCIAL PRIVACY. AREAS SO CERTAINLY HAPPY TO REASSURE THE AUTHOR OF ANY KINDS OF NEED TO RESTATE THAT. THANK YOU. ON SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENT. DO WE HAVE A MOTION. IT WOULD DO OKAY YEAH THE MOTIONS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WAIT A SECOND WHO MOVED. AND. MISTER MCCURRY WELL SECOND. OKAY OF MR THURMAN SECOND OKAY. THAT THE MOTION IS TO PASS WITH AMENDMENTS TO APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL ARE. PUT ON AYE KILEY. HOW THEY KNOW LACKEY? KALRA. CALLER AYE MCCARTY AYE MCCARTY AYE THURMOND. WEBER. WEBER I. TWO BILLS FOR VOTERS OUT. ALL RIGHT. NEXT OVER TO MR NEWS AREA WHICH HAS BEEN SITTING OUT THERE PATIENTLY. THE SMILE MAY COME UP. PRESENT YOUR BILL IT'S. AB TWENTY THREE NINETEEN A FILE ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN FIFTEEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THAT COLLEAGUES AND FOR THE SAKEOF. THE COMMITTEE'S WORK AHEAD I'LL I'LL KEEP IT VERY BRIEF. AB TWENTY THREE NINETEEN WITH DELETE THE TERM FOREIGN LANGUAGE FROM THE EDUCATION CODE AND REPLACE IT WITH THE TERM WORD WELL WORLD LANGUAGE. STRAIGHT FORWARD. AS IT SOUNDS WITH ME IS NICOLE AND THAT IT'S A PROGRAM SPECIALIST THAT THE ST ONE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THANK YOU. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR O'DONNELL IN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE AS HE SAID MY NAME IS MICHAEL NAY DEBTS AND I AM SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA LANGUAGE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND I WILL BE BRIEF. WORLD LANGUAGE PROGRAMS PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH LINGUISTIC AND INTERCULTURAL KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND PROFICIENCIES NECESSARY TO INTERACT WITH SPEAKERS OF OTHER LANGUAGES. IN WAYS THAT DEMONSTRATE THEIR READINESS FOR LIFE WORK AND CITIZENSHIP IN OUR DIVERSE EVOLVING AND INTERCONNECTED SOCIETY. BUT IN ED CODE AND OTHER OFFICIALS STATE DOCUMENTS THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS WORLD LANGUAGE BUT AS FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND THIS POSES DIFFICULTIES ON NUMEROUS FRONTS. FOR EXAMPLE THE WORD FOREIGN OFTEN HAS A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION THAT SETS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE OR OBJECTS APART FROM OTHERS AS BEING STRANGE. ALIEN DIFFERENT AND UNFAMILIAR. AND THE FACT THAT THESE FOUR TERMS ARE THE MOST COMMON SYNONYMS OF THE WORD FOREIGN PROVIDES COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT CLASSIFYING THE STUDY OF LANGUAGES AS FOREIGN. RISKS PROMOTING A CONNOTATION THAT IS IN DIRECT CONTRAST TO THE UNIFYING WORK WE DO S. WORLD LANGUAGE EDUCATORS. AND TO THE DISTINCT VALUE THAT CALIFORNIA'S VAST LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY BRINGS TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR LOCAL AND GLOBAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. AND IN FACT IN CALIFORNIA A STATE THAT IS RICH IN DIVERSITY NO LANGUAGES TRULY FOREIGN. CHANGING ALL REFERENCES IN AT CODE AND OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS TO WORLD LANGUAGE SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT OUR WEALTH OF NATIVE AND ACQUIRED LANGUAGES ARE AN ASSET. THAT SETS CALIFORNIA APART AND CERTAINLY NOT A FOREIGN PHENOMENON IN OUR LINGUISTIC AND CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY. IN FACT AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE AND THE NUMEROUS NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN CALIFORNIA ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT FOREIGN. BUT CURRENTLY THESE TRULY AMERICAN LANGUAGES MUST BE CLASSIFIED AS FOREIGN LANGUAGES DUE TO THE WORDING CURRENTLY IN PLACE AN AD CODE. AND FOR ALL OFFICIAL EDUCATION DOCUMENTS. IN ADDITION IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT FORTY TWO OF FIFTY STATES HAVE ALREADY A RACE TO THE TERM FOREIGN AND REPLACED IT WITH THE TERM WORLD WHEN REFERENCING COURSES OF STUDY AIMED. AT LEARNING LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. THERE FOR IN THE STATE IN THE SPIRIT OF INCLUSIVENESS AND ON BEHALF OF OUR STUDENTS WORLD IN WHICH PROGRAMS AND THE DIVERS CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES. WE APPROVED WE URGE YOU TO APPROVE AB TWENTY THREE NINETEEN AND ADOPT THE TERM WORLD LANGUAGE THINKING. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MARTHA ZERO GOES IDEAS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER WE SUPPORT THE BILL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES ITEM NUMBER TWO. I AND NUMBER TWELVE AND NUMBER TWELVE. THEY BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR HEARING OUR BILL A. B. TWO TWO SEVEN ONE. AND AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER AND WATCHING MY STUDENTS FOR MANY MANY YEARS I EAT LUNCH. A THAT WE KNOW THAT OVER THE YEARS. THAT OUR LUNCHES OF CHANGE WE WENT FROM A. SCHOOL SITES PREPARING MEALS ON SITES EVEN CENTRAL KITCHENS PREPARING MEALS TO NOW A MUCH OF THE LUNCH I. TYPES OF FOODS ARE PACKAGED IN BROUGHT TO THE SCHOOLS SO MY BILL WOULD HELP REDUCE FOOD WASTE ON OUR K.. TWELVE SCHOOLS BY EXPANDING EXISTING GRANT OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOW AVAILABLE THROUGH THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM EQUIPMENT ASSISTANCE GRANTS. I BASICALLY THIS WHOLE OUT SCHOOLS TO MATCH THEIR FUNDS WITH THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH TO BUY A LARGER EQUIPMENT SO THEY COULD IN FACT START OUGHT TO COOK. HEALTHIER MEALS NELSON MIGHT STILL THAT'LL TAKE A QUITE A BIT OF TIME IN ONE OF THE DISTRICTS IN MY WAS. DISTRICT CENTRALIA THEY ACTUALLY ALREADY ARE DOING THIS AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS THEY'RE TAKING SOME OF THEIR OLDER. TYPES OF EQUIPMENT THAT THEY PRETTY MUCH PUT AWAY IN THE LAST DECADE BROUGHT IT OUT HAVE PURCHASED SOME OTHER TYPES OF LARGER COOKING EQUIPMENT TO PRETTY MUCH PREPARE. OF FOOD ON SITE THERE. THEY NOW CALL THEIR COOK A CHEF THEY SCHOOL CHEF WHICH WE HAVE HEARD THAT I'M SURE BUT. THOUGH THE OF A SHELF ON BELIEVES IN WHAT HE'S DOING SO MUCH THAT HE SAYS IS YOUNG DAUGHTER ACTUALLY EATS THE FOOD AND THEY TESTED OUT AT HOME. HE'S ALSO TOLD US THAT ON SOME OF THE PARENTS THEMSELVES HAVE CALLED TO RECENT DATA. ASKS FOR THE RECIPES BUT THIS STORY REALLY RELATES NOT ONLY TO. NOT WASTING FOOD BUT TO CREATING HEALTHIER STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUS SO WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. Q. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT SEEN OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION SITTING ON A CONCERT BEHIND THE. THE DICE. TO KILEY. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISS SOME I SAW AYE AYES ONE EXTRA UNDERSTANDING THIS THERE'S BEEN WHAT A THREE MILLION DOLLAR. POT OF MONEY THAT'S BECOME AVAILABLE THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS TO APPLY FOR AND UP TO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR. BLOCKS IS THAT RIGHT. WHAT WOULD BE FOR A MATCHING GRANT SO I AND YES BUT THAT THE EXISTING PROGRAMS? TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IF THEY ARE INTERESTED IN THIS TYPE OF APPROACH. SCHOOLS THAT ARE GETTING THAT FEDERAL FUNDS EIGHT IS NOT GONNA LIKE THE RICH GETTING RICHER AND THE DAY THEY WE AREN'T NECESSARILY GIVING THE FUNDS TO THE SAME SCHOOLS AND IT'S UP TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IF THEY WANT TO APPLY BUT IF THEY THEY MAY. ALREADY HAVE APPLIED AND HAVE STARTED THIS PROCESS BUT IT WOULD BE SO MAYBE MULTIPLE SCHOOLS CAN JOIN TOGETHER OUGHT TO HAVE A CENTRAL TYPE OF KITCHEN THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT PUTTING THEIR MONEY. TOGETHER. BUT YES IT IS A IT IT WOULD BE JOINING THE FEDERAL DOLLARS WITH THE STATE DOLLARS SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH. ON IT TO PUT TOGETHER TO IN ESSENCE BUILD SOME TYPE OF CENTRAL KITCHEN AND WE USE TO HAVE THOSE IN MOST OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. MOST OF THOSE WERE CLOSED DOWN. NOT AFFECT MY MOTHER USED TO WORK CAN ONE OF THE CENTRAL KITCHENS AND THAT'S WHERE THEY ACTUALLY PREPARED FOOD LIKE. POTATOES BOILED THEM AND MADE MASHED POTATOES VERSES USING PROCESSED FOOD. WELL I MEAN I YEAH I I DON'T OF DATA YOU KNOW I OBJECT TO THAT. IDEAS AND THINGS COULD BE A REALLY GOOD THING FOR DISTRICTS I WAS WONDERING CUT OF WHY IS THAT YOU KNOW IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS NOT ENOUGH IS. TWO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVEN IF FOUR FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS APPLIED FOR THAT THAT STILL VERY LIMITED TO REALLY START. KIND OF A AYE PILOT THAT COULD TAKE OFF AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS SO THIS IS IN ESSENCE A MATCHING FUNDS. OKAY I GUESS I JUST LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE. INFORMATION ON. YOU CAN GET YOU ARE NOT AGRICULTURE DECIDED TO SET THE LIMITS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SO WHY. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE WINNING PANIC APPLICATIONS AND THEN AUGMENT THAT MONEY RATHER TRY TO CREATE A MORE WIDELY. DISTRIBUTED BENEFIT. WELL IF YOU THINK ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S STILL IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BUT TO BRING BACK WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A CENTRAL TYPE OF KITCHEN. AND YOU LOOK AT DIFFERENT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT THAT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS DEPENDING ON HOW LARGE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS. ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT I WORK IN HAS FIFTEEN SCHOOLS IF YOU THINK ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER FIFTEEN SCHOOLS. THAT'S. CAN THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU MIGHT GET A BIG OF AN FOR THAT. SO ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT GO ALONG WITH THE COOKING UP A WORKING KITCHEN. THANK YOU SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS. YOU MAKE CLOSED WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS YEAR. WE DID A HERE WE HAVE A MOTION.

I FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE. YEAH I'LL AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY. AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE WILL SIMPLY ADD MIGRANT STUDENTS TO EXISTING LAW. SO THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE PARTIAL OR FULL CREDIT FOR WORK COMPLETED IN IT IN ANOTHER SCHOOL. AND BE EXEMPT FROM LOCAL COURSEWORK REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE EDITION ALL TO STATE COURSEWORK REQUIREMENTS IF A STUDENT CANNOT REASONABLY. REASONABLY MEET THEM IN THE TIME FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. CURRENT LAW PROVIDES EACH RIGHT STUDENTS IN FOSTER CARE THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS FORMER JUVENILE COURT STUDENTS. OR CHILDREN OF MILITARY FAMILIES RESEARCH HAS SHOWN STUDENT MOBILITY HAS NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON STUDENT SUCCESS INCLUDING TEST SCORES RETENTION AND HIGH SCHOOL COMPLETION. THE LEGISLATURE HAS LONG RECOGNIZED THAT STUDENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO MOVE REPEATEDLY FACE MANY OBSTACLES TO HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION AND HAS PASSED LEGISLATION TO ALLOW THEM TO GRADUATE. YET COMPLETE IMPORTANT GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS FRANKLY EXTENDING THESE RIGHTS. TO MIGRANT STUDENTS IS LONG OVERDUE. MIGRANT STUDENTS ARE SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND FACE A GREATER RISK MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE. PALOMA. MANY OF THEM WERE LIMITED IN THE TYPES OF EMPLOYMENT THEY COULD OBTAIN. AT THAT TIME. THE ABSENCE OF A PROPOSED BY AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY OF TWENTY ONE WERE NOT AVAILABLE. THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE IT IS PROPOSING TO EXEMPT BUSINESS. PROPOSING TO PROVIDE TO MIGRANT STUDENTS EXAMS EXEMPTIONS FROM SPECIFIC LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATIONS AND THE ABILITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO US EXCEPT THE PARTIAL CREDIT. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A FAIR BILL WE BELIEVE THIS IS UNNECESSARY BILL IF WE ARE TO SUPPORT OUR MIGRANT STUDENTS IN PURSUING THEIR HIGH SCHOOL. UP DIPLOMA THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER TO SUPPORT.

MISS CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO BEGIN THIS AFTERNOON BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND WITH APPRECIATION TO YOUR STAFF WORKING WITH MINE. THAT'S IMPROVE THIS BILL I AB TWENTY NINE FORTY NINE INCREASES THE EDUCATIONAL STABILITY OF MILITARY CHILDREN IN OUR STATE. ACCORDING TO US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CHILDREN OF MILITARY FAMILIES CHANGE SCHOOLS KILLERS UP TO NINE TIMES ON AVERAGE BEFORE GRADUATING. THESE CHILDREN ARE OFTEN FORCED TO EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL UNNECESSARY SCHOOL CHANGES DUE TO MILITARY HOUSING AVAILABILITY. A CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO FIFTY SIX THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN MILITARY DEPENDENTS ATTENDING K. TWELVE SCHOOLS IN OUR STATE WITH A LARGE CONCENTRATION NOT SURPRISE ME DOCTOR WEBER NUYS DISTRICTS. I KNOW WHAT NUMEROUS STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE STUDENT MOBILITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES HIGHER DROPOUT RATES IN A WIDER KNOWLEDGE GAP OF FOR THE STUDENTS. NOT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AB TWENTY NINE FORTY NINE GIVES OUR SERVICE FAMILIES THE OPTION. PLEADING ACADEMIC YEAR AT THEIR SCHOOL ORIGIN DESPITE A CHANGE IN RESIDENTS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR. THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDES pCHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS MILITARY STATUS CHANGED MID ACADEMIC YEAR. I IN THE CASE OF QUE. TO TENTH GRADE STUDENTS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE SCHOOL YEAR AT THEIR CURRENT SCHOOL AND FOR ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH GRADE STUDENTS THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION GET THEIR DIPLOMA. AT THEIR CURRENT SCHOOL A BETWEEN AYE FORTY NINE EMPOWERS LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO REDUCE THE NUMBER UNNECESSARY SCHOOL TRANSITIONS FOR THESE OF IMPORTANT STUDENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. AND WITH ME I HAVE ONE WITNESS AT KELLY MADE WITH THE RESULT WHOSETHE REGAL SCHOOL LIAISON FOR UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS INSTALLATIONS WES. GOOD AFTERNOON.

WE ARE COVER SEVEN INSTALLATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF THE THIRTY TWO MILITARY INSTALLATIONS THAT ARE HERE. WE ALSO HAVE APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. MARINE CORPS CHILDREN OF ACTIVE DUTY MARINES. THAT ARE ATTENDING SCHOOL HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WITH SO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN ATTENDING SCHOOL CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS DRINKER TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY THE QUALITY OF. EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES. AND THEIR SUCCESS. OUR STUDENTS MOVE EVERY THREE YEARS TYPICALLY CAUSING THEM TO ATTEND. AN AVERAGE JUST SIX TO NINE SCHOOLS BEFORE THEY GRADUATE. AND THE REQUIRE WORKS VERY HARD TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE HIGH DEGREE OF. TRANSITION ARM MARINE FAMILY THINKER. WHICH ARE OFTENTIMES VERY NECESSARY FOR IT ON MISSION REQUIREMENTS IN TRAINING. AND WE HAVE A VARIETY OF POLICIES THAT REDUCE MIDYEAR TRANSFERS AND PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT MILITARY SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN THROUGH THEIR TRANSITIONS TO INCLUDE ON. A PROGRAM CALLED THE SCHOOL LIAISON PROGRAM. ONE WAY THAT THE STATE CAN CONTINUE TO ASSIST MILITARY FAMILIES IS TO JOIN US IN REDUCING MID YEAR SCHOOL TRANSFERS THAT NOT ONLY HURTS SCHOOLS THAT MUST ADJUST TO THE FREQUENT TRANSITION. OF THEIR POPULATION BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. CAN I HURT MILITARY CHILDREN AND THEIR CIVILIAN PEERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CHAIR O'DONNELL AUTHORED AB TWENTY TO FORTY SIX WHICH REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO ADOPT POLICIES FOR THE PREVENTION OF STUDENT SUICIDES. AND REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN A MODEL SUICIDE PREVENTION POLICY. BUILDING UPON THIS LEGISLATION GIORDANO AND I HAVE JOINT AUTHORED AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE. WHICH WOULD SUPPORT OUR EFFORT OUR SCHOOLS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE SUICIDE AWARENESS AND PREVENT FURTHER TRAGEDIES BY OFFERING ONLINE SUICIDE PREVENTION TRAINING FOR ALL SCHOOL STAFF. AS WELL AS STUDENTS.

BE TRAINED ON THIS TOPIC GENERALLY VIEWING SCHOOL STAFF AS GATE KEEPERS YOU CAN PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN PREVENTING SUICIDE. AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO IDENTIFY EVIDENCE BASED ONLINE SUICIDE PREVENTION TRAINING PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE FUNDING TO MAKE THE IDENTIFIED TRAINING PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. SERVING STUDENTS IN GRADES SEVEN TO TWELVE AT NO COST TO THE SCHOOLS. THIS LEGISLATION IS SUBJECT TO A BUDGET APPROPRIATION AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SCHOOLS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO USE A TRAINING PROGRAM. WHICH WILL BE OFFERED ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. THE GOAL OF AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE IS TO BETTER EQUIP IN SUPPORT SCHOOLS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO TRAINING AND A COST EFFECTIVE AND CONVENIENT MANNER. TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS.

THANKFULLY REACHES RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT HAVING AT LEAST ONE SUPPORTIVE ADULTS IN THEIR LIVES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THAT RISK. FOR OUR LGBTQ YOUTH. RESEARCH HAS ALSO SHOWN THAT THE NUMBER ONE PERSON A FELLOW STUDENT TURNS TO WHEN TRYING TO HELP A FRIEND WHO MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. IS A TEACHER.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO BE BEFORE YOU TO PRESENT. AB TWO ONE FIVE THREE. THE BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO OUR TEACHERS TO SUPPORT LGBTQ STUDENTS. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY A DURING THE INTERIM. TO HOST A ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION ON HOW WE SUPPORT LGBTQ STUDENTS WHO OFTEN ARE IMPACTED BY BULLYING. AND HARASSMENT CAN MISTREATMENT. AND. AS PART OUR CONVERSATION WE LANDED ON. THE NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR EDUCATORS. AS YOU KNOW OUR STUDENTS OFTEN FACE VERBAL PHYSICAL IN ONLINE HARASSMENT BOTH INSIDE AND OUT OF SCHOOL. IT'S MATTER FACT MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF LGBTQ STUDENTS REPORT HEARING ANTI LGBT Q. REMARKS AMONG OTHER DISCRIMINATORY ACTIONS BY THEIR PEERS. AS RESULT. LGBTQ STUDENTS CANNOT BE THE BEST STUDENTS THAT THEY CAN BE WHEN THEY ARE SUBJECTED. TO THESE CONDITIONS IT'S DIFFICULT TO LEARN. WHEN YOU FEAR FOR YOUR SAFETY OR YOU FEAR DISCRIMINATION OR RETALIATION ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. UNFORTUNATELY MANY LGBTQ STUDENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT. DO NOT REPORT THESE INCIDENTS TO STAFF. AB STUDENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS CERTAIN AT BET THOSE WHO ARE AROUND THEM WILL HAVE THE APPROPRIATE KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. THAT'S WHY IT'S CRITICAL THAT TEACHERS AND STAFF BE EQUIPPED WITH THE TRAINING AND TOOLS THEY NEED TO SUPPORT OUR LGBTQ YOU. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THAT TEACHERS IN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL RECEIVED TRAINING ABOUT LGBTQ SERVICES AND SUPPORTS SO THEY CAN KNOW HOW TO BEST SUPPORT. AND LGBTQ YOUTH. WHEN THEY COME SEEKING SUPPORT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS RICK SOBRE. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT EQUALITY CALIFORNIA AND KATHY SURE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE IT ACLU. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS RICK SOBRE WITH THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA. WE ARE PRINT WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN. AND WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL. TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF THE TRAINING THEY NEED TO CREATE SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS INCLUDES LOOTING THOSE WHO ARE LGBT Q.. AND MAYBE FACING HARASSMENT OR LACK OF ACCEPTANCE AT SCHOOL REJECTION AT HOME OR DISCRIMINATION IN THE BROADER COMMUNITY. OUR TEACHERS AND STAFF ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF ENSURING THAT ALL CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF BACKGROUND ZIP CODE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY. HAVE A SHOT AT THE AMERICAN DREAM. THAT OFTEN MEANS. PROVIDING A SAFETY NET AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF DISCRIMINATION AND LACK OF ACCEPTANCE THAT MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY OUR YOUTH FACE. AND WHICH IS TOO OFTEN THE RESULT OF HIGH WHICH ARE TOO OFTEN RESULTS IN HIGHER DROPOUT RATE. LOWER ECONOMIC SUCCESS. HIGH RATES OF HOMELESSNESS FOR OUT OF TEN. HOMELESS YOUTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE LGBTQ. A HIGH RATES OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SUICIDE AMONG OTHER DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AND WELL BEING. FUNDAMENTALLY EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA DESERVES A SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE SCHOOL WHERE THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN AND SUCCEED. WHEN LGBT Q. STUDENTS HAVE THAT SUPPORT IN SCHOOL THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF OVERCOMING THESE DISPARITIES THE DISPARITIES I MENTIONED. AND SUCCEEDING IN LIFE INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY. THAT'S WHY A QUALITY CALIFORNIA IS SO DEDICATED TO IMPROVING SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS AND MAKING THEM SAFER AND MORE INCLUSIVE. IT'S WHY WE'VE LOST LAUNCH ARE SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE SCHOOLS PROGRAM TO ASSESS WHAT SCHOOLS ARE DOING TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT THEIR LGBTQ STUDENTS AND HIGHLIGHT BEST PRACTICES FROM SCHOOLS. THAT ARE CREATING INNOVATIVE INITIATIVES AND ACHIEVING POSITIVE OUTCOMES. ULTIMATELY WE KNOW THAT SUPPORTIVE TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF CAN CHANGE OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES THEY CAN GIVE AND LGBTQ KID FROM LONG BEACH ARE OAKLAND OR ORANGE COUNTY OR FRESNO OR SAN DIEGO. A SHOT AT A BRIGHTER FUTURE. IF WE CAN EXPECT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS AND STAFF TO FILL THIS CRITICAL MISSION WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO SUPPORT. EVERY CHILD WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN FOR CHAMPIONING THEIR FOR CHAMPIONING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF BY VOTING I. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. EXISTING LAWS INTENDED TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR LGBTQ STUDENTS AGAINST HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION AT SCHOOL. AMONG OTHER PROTECTIONS LAW REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ASSESS WHETHER ELEAZAR PROVIDE INFORMATION TO MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS ON SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR. LGBTQ STUDENTS. DESPITE THESE STEPS LGBTQ STUDENTS STILL FACE BULLYING HARASSMENT AND A LACK OF ACCEPTANCE WHICH LEAD NOT ONLY TO LOWER LEVELS OF ACADEMIC EXCESS BUT ALSO TO A RANGE OF OUT OF SCHOOL NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE IS A SIMPLE STEP TOWARDS ENSURING THAT THE INFORMATION ON RESOURCES REACHES THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT FOR STUDENTS. BY REQUIRING TRAININGS FOR TEACHERS OF UPS GRADES SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE ON THE SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND ON STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT LGBTQ STUDENTS IN THEIR SCHOOLS. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE WILL HELP SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS CREATE THE SUPPORT OF AN INCLUSIVE SCHOOLS WE NEED WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU ARE WITH THAT WILL DOCTOR WEBER WILL BE PRESENTING A FINAL SIXTEEN EIGHTY TWO SIX ZERO ONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON YOU TO PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY SIX A ONE WHICH EXTENDS A CALIFORNIA HEALTHY USE ACT. COMPREHENSIVE SEX EDUCATION AND HIV PREVENTION MANDATES ON TRADITIONAL. AUNTS TREES THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. AT THE TIME WHEN WE PRESENTED A. B. OF TWENTIES AT THE FIRST BILL IN TERMS OF THE HEALTHY YOUTH ACT. IT WAS NOT MY EVER MY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD NOT APPLY TO ALL SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF SEX EDUCATION HEALTHY EDUCATION. IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE A SYSTEM MEETS THIS FUNDAMENTAL AS READING WRITING AND MATH AND THE SCIENCES ARE AND WHERE WE. AND BUT OTHERS HAD A TENDENCY TO NOT SEE IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T CALL IT OUT EVEN THOUGH HE SAID IT WAS FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE DIDN'T CALL IT OUT. AND SO THEREFORE AB TWENTY SIX A ONE EXIST TODAY TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND HIV PREVENTION EDUCATION. AT LEAST ONCE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND IN HIGH SCHOOL WITH INSTRUCTION THAT IS ACCESSIBLE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND ENGLISH LEARNERS. THIS BILL REALLY SETS A FUND MUCH A FOUNDATIONAL BASELINE FOR SEX EDUCATION IN CHARTER SCHOOLS WHILE MAINTAINING SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY FOR CHARTERS TO DECIDE WHAT CURRICULUM THEY ADOPTED WHAT SPECIFIC GRAYSON PROVIDE INSTRUCTION AND OTHER CURRICULA ELEMENTS. THE RESEARCH IS CLEARLY YOUNG PEOPLE CRITICALLY NEED HELP QUALITY HEALTH EDUCATION. SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE IN THE TWELFTH GRADE CALIFORNIA'S GOING STI RATES ARE HIGHEST IN YOUNG PEOPLE AGES FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR. AND SADLY NEARLY TWELVE TO TEN PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS EXPERIENCE SEXUAL DATING VIOLENCE AND PHYSICAL DATING VIOLENCE WISP OF RESPECTIVELY. AS CALIFORNIA SEEKS TO ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ABUSE COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION WITH ITS FOCUS ON HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS CONSENT AND CHALLENGING NEGATIVE JIM JUST GENDER STEREOTYPES IS ESSENTIAL. FOR PREVENTING THESE NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS BEFORE THEY START. AT A TIME WHEN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ABBOTT FOR ADOLESCENT SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS BEING CUT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE THE SAME ACCESS. THE COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION THAT'S ALL OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS AB TWENTY SIX ONE DOES THIS BY ENSURING THAT ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVIDE INSTRUCTION ON COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION. WITH ME TODAY OF THIS BILL SPONSORED BY ACLU THE BLACK WOMAN OF WELLNESS AND AT ACTS FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS. OF WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX A ONE IS NANCY BURGERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF ON THE SAN FRANCISCO. ROY SUMMER IS A SENIOR AT THE SALIA UNIVERSITY PREPARATORY HIGH SCHOOL AND PHILLIP FULLEST OUT BURLINGAME WILL BE HERE FROM ACLU FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. YOU MAY PROCEED. TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES UNLESS YOU LIKE SPLIT THE TIME. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR NANCY BURKE CLASS AN ADOLESCENT HEALTH RESEARCHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS I'VE EVALUATED SEX EDUCATION PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IN THAT TIME OUR STATE HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF ADOLESCENTS THIS IS ATTRIBUTABLE IN PART TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. RESEARCH HAS MADE CLEAR THAT SEX EDUCATION THAT ADDRESSES BOTH ABSTINENCE AND BIRTH CONTROL CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON ADOLESCENTS DELAYING SEXUAL ACTIVITY. INCREASING CONDIMENT CONTRACEPTIVE USE AND REDUCING RATES OF UNINTENDED PREGNANCY. NEW RESEARCH SHOWS ADDITIONAL IMPACT WHEN EDUCATORS TALK WITH STUDENTS ABOUT GENDER STEREOTYPES SEXUAL ORIENTATION SEXUAL HARASSMENT CONSENT AND HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. ADOLESCENTS TURNED TO MANY SOURCES TO LEARN ABOUT SEX AND RELATIONSHIPS THEIR PARENTS FRIENDS SIBLINGS MOVIES AND TV THE INTERNET. AND OFTEN THE INFORMATION THAT THEY FIND IS CONFUSING MISLEADING OR JUST WRONG. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY IS ACT INSURERS THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKILLS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR BODIES FORMER SPEC POLL IN CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIPS AND PROTECT THEIR SEXUAL HEALTH. A FEW YEARS AGO I WORKED ON THE EVALUATION OF A NEW SEX EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR NINTH GRADE STUDENTS AT TEN CHARTER SCHOOLS IN LOS ANGELES. IT COVERED THE COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF TOPICS TOPICS NOW REQUIRED BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT. ONE YEAR LATER WE FOUND CONTINUED POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABILITY TO MANAGE RISKY SITUATIONS COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR PARTNERS AND USE OF HEALTH SERVICES. UNFORTUNATELY THE CLASSES ENDED WHEN THE FUNDING AND. STUDENTS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS ME THE SAME INFORMATION AS THEIR PEERS IN TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. A RECENT STUDY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY HAS SHOWN THAT THE SEX EDUCATION RECEIVED BY CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS IS OFTEN LACKING. RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT FEWER THAN HALF OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ADDRESSED KEY TOPICS LIKE CONDOM USE SEXUAL ORIENTATION COMMUNICATION WITH PARTNERS AND PARENTS AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT EDUCATION TO PREPARE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR A HEALTHY FUTURE. NOR IS IT EQUITABLE ALL YOUNG PEOPLE NEED AND DESERVE A ACCESS TO ACCURATE COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL HEALTH INFORMATION. AB TWENTY SIX NO ONE RECOGNIZES THE NEEDS OF THE GROWING NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS AND ENSURES THAT THEY HAVE A STRONG AND EVIDENCE BASED FOUNDATION IN HOUSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. A GOVERNING MY NAME IS LARRY SUMMERS I'M A SENIOR AT UNIVERSITY PREPARATORY HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS AT HER SCHOOL AND TULARE. COUNTY. A I AM HERE IS EITHER PRESENT AND IF FOR ACT REMAINING GIRLS AND THE SOURCE OF THE BEACH HE CENTER IN BY CELAYA AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI TWENTY SIX OH ONE. DURING MY TIME AS A STANDARD CHARTER SCHOOL I DID NOT RECEIVE FULLY COMPREHENDS OF SELF SET SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION. LIKE MY PEERS AT A PRICE I UNIFIED OPTED TO GO TO A CHARTER SCHOOL TO TAKE PART AND THEIR RIGOROUS CURRICULUM BY DID NOT DECIDE OFF INTENT INTENTIONALLY OPT OUT OF SEX ED. SEX ED ONLY TEACHES. TAX AND NOT ONLY TEACH US ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT OURSELVES OF SAFE SEX BUT THANKS TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT. ABOUT THE SEXUALITY SPECTRUM IN GENERATED GENDER IDENTITY THE INCLUSION OF LGBTQ EDUCATION NOT ONLY LAYS FOUNDATION FOR. LEAVE FOUNDATION FOR A KNOWLEDGE CURRENT THAT. MAYES FOUNDATION FOR KNOWLEDGE GROUP. THAT HOLDS CANS LOW BALLING FROM MY EXPERIENCE WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE COME BROKE HIS OF KNOWLEDGE INSTEAD OF FEARING THE UNKNOWN WE EXPERIENCED LAST BLAME CREE FRIENDSHIPS INSTEAD. WE KNOW SOME OF THE INFORMATION OF THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACTING PREGNANCY RATES HAVE DROPPED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT NOT MANDATING SEX AND ENTER SCHOOLS WE'RE LEAVING ABSTINENCE ONLY EDUCATION ON THE TABLE FOR HER SCHOOLS AND THE MEN ON THEIR OWN DISCUSSION. THESE ABSENCE ONLY EDUCATION DOES NOT ONLY. DOES MORE HARM THAN NO EDUCATION AT ALL. THE ME TACTIC FOR USE OF ABSENCE ON EDUCATION IS SHAMING THOSE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO BE ABSENT OR DON'T APPLY WITH THE MALE FEMALE BINARY SPECTRUM. THIS SHAMING NOT. JUST IS ANOTHER FORM OF BOWLING BY STUDENTS AND THE TEACHER ANOTHER THIS SHAMING NEGATIVELY FACT STUDENTS WHO ARE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT INDEED VIOLENCE OR FINDING THEIR OWN IDENTITY. BY WITHHOLDING SEX AT A LARGE PORTION OF THE NEXT GENERATION WILL NOT LEARN HOW TO PROTECT HOW PREPARE OURSELVES. PROTECTION OF OUR HEALTH NORMAL WE LEARN ABOUT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS HEALTHY BOUNDARIES OR LEARN ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT BUT STILL VERY NORMAL. THERE'S NO REASON FOR HER SCHOOL STUDENTS TO FALL BEHIND PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS. WE OUGHT TO EXPECT EQUAL EDUCATION REGARDLESS OF THE INSTITUTION THANK YOU THANK YOU WELL DONE. OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE ESTABLISHING ESTABLISHES ONGOING FUNDING FOR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. INNER K. TWELVE SCHOOLS AT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THIS BILL PROVIDES TWELVE BILLION PER YEAR FOR REGIONAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT THROUGH COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AS WELL THAT'S THE LOCAL THE MORE LOCAL INDIVIDUALS WHO HELPED CONNECT CT PROGRAMS. WITH INDUSTRY THERE THE INDUSTRY EXPERTS. CT IS CRITICAL FOR STUDENTS AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY I THINK YOU'RE HEARING THAT MORE AND MORE YOUR DISTRICTS. AS BUSINESSES NEED INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TRAINED IN ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE YOU'RE JUST NOT JUST FROM THE UNIVERSITY SIDE THE BACCALAUREATE SIDE. AS A TEACHER I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT CD PROGRAMS ENGAGE STUDENTS AND REDUCE DROPOUT RATES. STUDENTS NEED MULTIPLE PASSED EXCESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT. CT ENSURES THAT STUDENTS ARE pBETTER PREPARED FOR LIFE AFTER GRADUATION WHETHER THAT INCLUDES COLLEGE OR LEAD STRAIGHT TO A CAREER. CURRENCY T. FUNDING STREAMS EXPIRE THIS YEAR. WE NEED TO MAINTAIN A STRONG INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THIS LEGISLATOR HAS SUPPORTED IN THE PAST AND TO BUILD ON THAT INVESTMENT BY PROVIDING STABLE. ONGOING FUNDING TO K. TWELVE SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS PROPOSAL KEEPS THE EXISTING INCENTIVE GRANT APPROACH INTACT. AS IT IS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL ENSURING DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA RECEIVE FUNDING. AND THAT THIS REMAINS A PROGRAM THAT INCENTIVIZE IS THE CREATION AND SUPPORT. STRONG CT PROGRAMS IN A FAIR AND EQUITABLE MANNER. WE SEE NO NEED TO DISRUPT THE SUCCESSFUL EXISTING PROGRAMS BY CREATING A NEW LEVEL OF BUREAUCRACY WITH LOCAL CONSORTIA COORDINATED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT MAY END UP. LESS EQUITABLE. I RESPECT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM BUT I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES KNOW WHAT K. TWELVE SCHOOLS NEED. NOR SHOULD IT PLAY A ROLE IN MANAGING THEM. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE KEEPS K. TWELVE DOLLARS IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM. THIS IS CLEARLY A BY FOR THIS IS CLEARLY A BIPARTISAN ISSUE I AM PROUD TO BE JOINED BY TWENTY FIVE COLLEAGUES. AS JOINT AUTHORS AND CO AUTHORS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE INCLUDING MISTER CHAVEZ MISTER CARD ESTHER MCCARTY. A MISTER THURMAN AND MANY OTHERS AND TODAY WITH ME HERE IS OUR. BUSINESS BURKE I BELIEVE WISHES TO SPEAK TO THE ITEM AS WELL. SHE IS OUT OF YOUR CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CT AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE JOINT OFFERS AUTHORS ON THIS BILL IN A STRONG PROPONENT. CT. I THINK YOU FOR HAVING ME AS THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND ALSO IS THE PROUD SPONSOR JOINT AUTHOR OF AB SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE AND ONE I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL AND ALL OF THAT TWENTY FIVE BIPARTISAN MEMBERS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP. ON THIS ISSUE. THREE YEARS AGO WHEN WE ESTABLISH THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT WITH NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING I WAS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THAT PROGRAM AND THOUGHT IT WAS CRITICAL AT THAT TIME TO FILL THE FUNDING. GAP FOR CT. AFTER HOLDING SELECT COMMITTEES THROUGHOUT THE STATE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN SUPPORT OF THE C. T. INCENTIVE BROWN WE'VE HEARD FROM COUNTLESS TEACHERS STUDENTS. AND BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS ABOUT THE AMAZING WORK THAT IS BEING DONE AND THE RESULTS OF THE INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM. HISTORICALLY ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION DOES NOT HAVE A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE. AND THAT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY TO BE FOCUSED ON COLLEGE AND COOLEY CAREER READINESS FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. OUR STUDENTS ARE NOW COMPETING IN A LOCAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMY AND WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO HELP THEM SUCCEED. THE FUNDING FOR CT PROGRAMS NOT ONLY HELP STUDENTS DREAM OF POSSIBILITIES FOR THEIR FUTURE BUT THEY ALSO CREATE LOCAL BONDS BETWEEN BUSINESS LABOR AND GOVERNMENT THAT LAST GENERATION'S. WE MUST ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GAIN THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN A JOB THAT PROVIDES ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND WE MUST SUPPORT A STRONG AND GROWING MIDDLE CLASS. I HEARD A GREAT QUOTE. A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND ONE OF MY SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND IT WAS. IF WE TEACH TODAY'S STUDENTS AS WE TAUGHT YESTERDAY WE ROB THEM OF TOMORROW. LET'S BE INNOVATIVE LETS BUILD OUR ECONOMY AND LET'S GIVE OUR STUDENTS A TOMORROW I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON AB SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALSO WITH ME HERE TODAY IS VALLEY WHOSE VIEWS SUCH FROM THE FRESNO I COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THEN JERRY SMITH. FROM THE GERMAN SMITH FROM THE ACT CALIFORNIA STATE BUILDING TREATS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M VALERIE BICU SICH THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR KRYCEK GET AND REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL PROGRAMS AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS I AM A LOCAL SEATED RECIPIENT AS THE FISCAL AGENT FOR A SEVENTEEN DISTRICT CONSORTIUM. BUT ALSO SERVE AS ONE OF THE REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS OR OUR TAXES WERE CALLED. AND WE ARE IN PLACE TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS AS THEY GROW IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN THEIR LOCAL CT PROGRAMS. IT WAS EXPECTED THAT ALL K. TWELVE DISTRICTS WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THIS FUNDING THROUGH THEIR SUBMISSION OF A PLAN TO ENSURE THEIR SAFETY PROGRAMS WOULD WORK TOWARDS ATTAINING THE ELEVEN ELEMENTS OF A HIGH QUALITY PROGRAM. AND TO COMMIT TO THEIR DISTRICT MATCHED REQUEST AMOUNT APPLICATIONS WERE NOT COMPETITIVE WITH WINNERS AND LOSERS AND THE OUR TAPS WORKED WITH DISTRICTS TO SUBMIT COMPLETE APPLICATIONS THAT QUALIFY FOR FUNDING IF THEY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. THEIR FIRST ATTEMPT AS IN OUR TAP WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE PROMOTED VARIETY OF INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES AVAILABLE TO DISTRICTS THAT INCLUDES LINK LEARNING PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES MAGNET SCHOOLS. AND OUR APPEASE TO NAME A FEW OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'VE DEVELOPED AND EXPANDED RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CT STAFF IN OUR REGIONS. WHAT MAKES US EFFECTIVE IS THAT ALL OF US HAVE AND CONTINUE TO RUN CTN ROP PROGRAMS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WERE ACTUAL PRACTITIONERS OF WALK THE TALK? ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT IS CHARGED WITH PREPARING THEIR STUDENTS FOR BOTH COLLEGE AND CAREER. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE WOULD ENSURE THAT DISTRICTS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO SO ARE ROLLING QUE TWELVE IS TO HELP STUDENTS EXPLORE THEIR INTERESTS AND TALENTS WERE PROVIDING THE INFORMATION. ABOUT HOW THEY RELATE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF CAREER PATHS AND WITHIN INDUSTRY SECTORS AND WHERE THEY CAN GO TO PURSUE THEM FOLLOWING HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. K. TWELVE CT PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE PARTICIPATION OF INDUSTRY PARTNERS AND WE PLACE THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS IN WORK SITES AS A COMPONENT OF MANY OF OUR PEOPLE CLASSES. IF THE FUNDS BECOME ADMINISTERED THROUGH SOME COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS ACROSS THE REGION AND BECOME LIMITED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF INDUSTRY SECTORS A LOT OF THE WORK WITH OUR CURRENT INDUSTRY PARTNERS WILL BE LOST AS THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS. WOULD CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN CLOSING IF YOU DESIRE TO MAINTAIN OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS AND PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WHILE PREPARING ALL STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER READY. AND HAVING AN IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND MAKING USE OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. THEN I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PASS AB SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE IS THE WAY TO SUPPORT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM ON A PERMANENT BASIS THANK.

ON THE RECORD IT'S IN AND SUPPORTING THAT END DIFFERENT BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES AS WELL IT'S BECAUSE THE CD E. HANDLES THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM IS PRETTY SIMPLE. THEY ARE OF BEST POSITION TO FIGURE OUT WHY THERE AREN'T MORE KIDS GETTING EXPOSURE TO THESE CLASSES BECAUSE THESE KIDS. DON'T REALIZE THAT THERE'S A WORLD OF WORK OUT THERE FOR THEM THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE. A TRADITIONAL FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY EDUCATION NOW TO BE CLEAR WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF. FURTHERING ONE'S EDUCATION AFTER HIGH SCHOOL WE CALL IT A PARTNERSHIP AFTER THREE TO FIVE YEARS OF OUR FRIENDSHIP PROGRAM BASICALLY COLLEGE FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. THESE KIDS HAVE BEEN EARNING AND LEARNING. WHILE. HONING THE SKILLS OF THE CRAFT THAT WILL FOLLOW THEM FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. THEY DO THIS. IN THE JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM AT ALMOST NO COST TO THEM. THAT PARTICULAR SUBSET OF THE ESTATE OF PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM SYSTEM IN THE STATE GRADUATES NINETY TWO PERCENT OF THE OPPRESSES THE COME THROUGH. IS PAID FOR BY THE LABOR MOVEMENT BY THE UNIONS THAT PARTICIPATE IN IT. AND THESE. YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN A GUY SAID ARE EARNING A LEARNING WHILE. HONING THEIR SKILLS AND THEY.

IN THE MEANTIME THERE'S TONS OF WORK OUT THERE YOU GUYS ARE MAKING ALL KINDS OF CHOICES HERE WHETHER IT'S SB ONE OR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FIX. YOU'RE REQUIRING SKILLED AND TRAINED WORK FORCES ON CERTAIN TYPES OF PUBLIC OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS SO YOU ARE MAKING DECISIONS HERE TO CREATE SO MUCH WORK FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS.

DO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANYTHING THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WILL GO FILED YOUR WITNESS. RULES BUT I DO. WANT TO SAY THAT I'M A PROUD TO AND AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. I WON'T. STATE AGAIN THEIR COLLEGE CAREER PATHWAY BENEFITS WITH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID TO THEM VERY CLEARLY. I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM NUMEROUS. SUPERINTENDENTS FROM COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WHO HAVE SAID THAT. NOT ONLY IS RENEWAL IMPORTANT BUT MAKING SURE THAT. OF THESE DOLLARS DON'T GET FURTHER SEPARATED FROM THEIR ABILITY TO DO THIS WORK AND THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A GREATER DISTANCE IS CRITICAL. AND. IF NOTHING ELSE I'D SAY SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE WHEN ELSE HAS IN THE BILL UNITED AS MANY SECTORS AS WE JUST SAW. USUALLY WHEN. WELL THANK YOU CAN. USUALLY IT WHEN THE LINE WRAPS AROUND IN THIS CHAMBER IS BECAUSE EVERYONE SAYING I'M OPPOSED THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE CAN SAY WE SUPPORT. AND I GUESS ON A PERSONAL NOTE I'VE NEVER HAD THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SUPPORT ANY AMOUNT BILLS. SO YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR. IF I WON I WON ALSO. AUTHORS FOR. PUTTING TOGETHER THIS BILL BUT. BUT. YOU NO I I GUESS MYCONCERN LIES NOT IN THE BILL ITSELF BUT IN IN IN THE WHOLE LCF F. SITUATION. BECAUSE THIS BILL DOES NOT NECESSARILY PRODUCE ANY NEW MONEY. IS SHIFTING AROUND OF THE CURRENT MONEY. THE PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT DATA NINETY EIGHT IS NINETY EIGHT IS NINETY EIGHT PROBLEM IT EIGHT AND SO. I THINK IN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF LC A FAST WE EX WE HAD EXPECTED PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN. THE SAME EFFORTS IN THE SAME PROGRAMS THEY HAD BEFORE. AND UNFORTUNATELY SCHOOLS DID NOT DO THAT. BECAUSE THEY TOOK THE CT MONEY THAT WAS THERE PUT IT BACK INTO THE BASE GRANT AND DIDN'T NECESSARILY FEEL THE NEED TO FUND. THE CT PROGRAMS. AND SO I WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE IF FOR SOME STRANGE REASON. THE GRANTING PROCESS OF WHATEVER HAPPENS HERE DOESN'T WORK OUT THE WAY IT SHOULD AT SOME POINT WITH FOLKS AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME. ASISTIR STILL SHOULD HAVE A COMMITMENT TO CT. BECAUSE THE MONEY IS STILL THERE. AND THE KIDS ARE STILL THERE AND THE NEED IS STILL THERE. AND SO I THINK WHEN WE DID THE GRANT PROCESS SEVERAL YEARS AGO BEFORE SOME OF YOU WERE HERE. WE END UP DOING IT BECAUSE SCHOOLS REMAINED ON DOING THE DISTRICTS DID NOT DO CT. YET THE MONEY THAT THE CATEGORICAL FUNDS THAT HAD BEEN IN CT WE'RE BASICALLY NOW PUT BACK INTO EL CFF AND IT'S THE BASS GRANT. AND THE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THOSE THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUE IT AND SOME SCHOOLS DID AND SOME DID NOT. AND SO AS A RESULT THEY WE CREATED THIS NEED THAT FOLKS NEEDED TO BASICALLY DO CT AND WE CREATED THIS QUIET PROCESS TO KIND OF HELP KICK OFF THE SITUATION. BUT I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THE MONEY IS THERE IN SHOULD BE THERE IN THE LOCAL AND IN THE BASS GRANT. AND LCF F. TO DO C. T. BECAUSE IT WAS THERE BEFORE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND ALL THAT MONIES PUT PUT IN. SO OFTEN TIMES WHEN THE GOVERNOR VETOED THESE BILLS. HE'S VETOING BECAUSE HE KEEPS SAYING OVER AND OVER I DON'T WANT CATEGORICAL WHEELS DID BEGIN TO COME BACK AGAIN. BECAUSE THE ALL THAT CATEGORICAL MONEY WOULD BACK INTO IT SO I THINK WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN AS DISTRICTS A COMMITMENT TO SEE T. E.. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE OUR KIDS ARE ALL OF OUR KIDS SOMEONE A COLLEGE SOMEONE DO IN CT  <u><c.green>BUT THAT'S WHAT A WELL</c></u> ROUNDED DISTRICT DOES. IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMS FOR ALL KIDS AND SO I THINK WE DO THIS BUT IF FOR SOME STRANGE REASON. STUFF DISAPPEARS A FOR SOME STRANGE REASON THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T SIGN THIS. WE AS A STATE AND U. S. DISTRICT SHOULD STILL HAVE A COMMITMENT CT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I VERY MUCH MISTER O'DONNELL AND. MS BURKE FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND THAT AND BUILDING MOMENTUM. AROUND THIS ISSUE. I DO THINK THAT. DOCTOR WEBER'S COMMENTS ARE WELL TAKEN AYE BUT I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT EFFORT ON BOTH SIDES THESE LAST COUPLE YEARS TO.
