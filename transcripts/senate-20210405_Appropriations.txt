CALL THEN ARE YOU. DR KIM OR YOU RYAN COUZENS RIGHT THAT PRESENTS OKAY- ALL RIGHT MR COUSINS I THINK WE'RE WAITING ON DR KIM SO MR COUSINS IF YOU COULD USE YOUR OPPORTUNITY AND CONFINE YOURSELF TO TWO MINUTES THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU SIR- GOOD MORNING DISTINGUISHED PANEL MY NAME IS RYAN COUSINS I'M AN ASSISTANT CHIEF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH YOU'LL COUNTY CALIFORNIA. THE FISCAL IMPACT OF S. B. EIGHTY TWO WILL BE THAT IT WILL TELL EVERY THIEF IN CALIFORNIA. THAT YOU CAN USE FORCE TO STEAL AND AS LONG AS YOU DON'T INFLICT GREAT BODILY INJURY YOU WILL GET A MISDEMEANOR PETTY THEFT. MISDEMEANOR PETTY THEFT DON'T DETER. SERIOUS THEMES WE HAVE THE TESTIMONY FROM THE THIEVES THEMSELVES THE ESTABLISHED THAT SO THIS WILL AND CAUSE AN INCREASE IN ROBBERIES BECAUSE ROBBERIES ARE MORE LUCRATIVE. AND THIS WILL MOVE THE RISK YOU GET THE BEST STUFF WITH ROBBERIES PURSES AND WALLETS. THERE WERE 200-008-0040 NINE STRONG ARM ROBBERIES WHICH IS WHAT THESE WOULD BE- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IF THIS CAUSED A 10% INCREASE IN ROBBERIES. THE MARGINAL COST FOR POLICE RESPONSE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL ANNUAL COST OF SEVEN POINT NINE EIGHT MILLION THAT WOULD BE CONSERVATIVE THAT'S THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. CALIFORNIA IS OBVIOUSLY MORE EXPENSIVE. IF THAT WITH THAT CRIME BOARD PAYOUTS TO VICTIMS OF THESE ADDITIONAL ROBBERIES WOULD BE FOUR POINT ONE NINE SEVEN. IT'S LIKELY THE INCREASE WILL BE MORE COMMENSURATE WITH THE INCREASE OF LARCENY THEFT THAT HAPPENED WITH PROP FORTY SEVEN. THAT THAT'S THE CASE THAT WOULD BE A 27% INCREASE WHICH WOULD BE. A PLUS TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE SIX MILLION A MARGINAL COSTS FOR POLICE RESPONSE. AT ELEVEN POINT THREE THREE MILLION IN POTENTIAL VICTIM REIMBURSEMENTS AS IF EVERYONE APPLIED. THE AUTHOR HAS SAID THAT. IF THESE ADDITIONAL ROBBERIES OCCUR AND ASSAULTS HAPPENED THOSE ASSAULTS CAN BE CHARGED AS FELONIES. THAT PROVIDES EVEN MORE OF AN EXPENSE WITH AGAIN WITH THAT 10% INCREASE. IT WOULD BE PLUS TWENTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION A MARGINAL COSTS FOR POLICE. AND FOUR MILLION FOR POTENTIAL VICTIM REIMBURSEMENTS WITH A 27% INCREASE IT WOULD BE PLUS. SEVENTY NINE MILLION A MARGINAL PLEASE COSTS AND TEN POINT NINE MILLION IN VICTIM REIMBURSEMENTS. NONE OF THIS INCLUDES THE COST TO BRING PEOPLE BACK FROM THE PRISON. AND THE INCREDIBLE COST TO VICTIMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I DO WE HAVE A PROFESSOR CAME ON THE LINE. I DON'T BUT IF YOU WERE ON THE LINE AS A PARTICIPANT. DR KIM YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AND WE WILL OPEN YOUR LINE. ALL RIGHT WE DO NOT HAVE DOCTOR CAME WITH US- SO WE WILL GO BACK TO OUR NORMAL COURSE OF OPPOSITION TESTIMONY I SEE NO ONE IN ROOM FORTY TWO- THREE. OPPOSED I SEE NOBODY IN ROOM TWENTY FORTY.

WE'VE HEARD FROM SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION- I SEE NO HAN SO. I'M SORRY OUR- THEY SAY THEY DO HAVE A FILE MY MISTAKE. SEE THAT I WAS THAT I MESSED UP JOEY. TELL YOURS. PHYSICIAN ON THE BILL AT THIS TIME WHICH IS NOT THE CALIBER RECYCLE ESTIMATES THAT WORKLOAD TO OVERSEE THAT CONTAINER STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION- AND TO ENFORCE THE VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE CAL RECYCLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR EXISTING STAFFING LEVELS- UNTIL THE TRANSITION IS COMPLETE THIS CONSISTENT BUT TO EARN TWENTY TWO POSITIONS AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TO PRIMARILY PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM AND THE ESTIMATE AN ADDITIONAL NINE TO SEVENTEEN LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO ASSIST WITH THE TRANSITION. AND TO PERMANENT. TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM TAILORED TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL AND REPLACE THE DIVISION OF RECYCLING INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE TIMING AND COST OF THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NOT CLEAR AT THIS TIME ACOSTA ESTIMATED TO BE UP TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FROM THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING FUND. UNTIL THE TRANSITION IS COMPLETE. WE KNOW THAT THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING FUND EXPERIENCES FALL TO LEVELS OF EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES. AND ANY INCREASED COSTS TO THE FUND COULD EXACERBATE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE FIND A AND MOST OF THE REVENUES THAT ARE DEPOSITED INTO THIS FUND WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE- BEVERAGE CONTAINER STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION. INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN SIERRA B. COLLECTIONS ANNUALLY. WE WOULD NOTE THAT- THIS CALL MAY RESULT IN SOME AMOUNT OF SAVINGS DUE TO THE REDUCED ROLE FOR CAL RECYCLE IN THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAM ONCE THE TRANSITION TO THE STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION TAKES PLACE HOWEVER. ANY SAVINGS COULD PUT PRESSURE ON INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT WHICH IS IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT TO FIND POSITIONS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FUNDED BY THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING FUND. THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS ESTIMATES A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING FUND ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. FROM AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT WITH CAL RECYCLE TO ASSIST COMMUNITY CONSERVATION CORPS. TO BECOME CERTIFIED RECYCLING CENTERS. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD NOTE THE CAL RECYCLE CURRENTLY PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY NINE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN GRANTS FROM THE BCRF. TO COMMUNITY CONSERVATION COURSE TO ASSIST IN BEVERAGE CONTAINER. CONTAINER COLLECTION AND LITTER REDUCTION. AND IF THE STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION DOES NOT MAINTAIN THIS GRANT PROGRAM. THE CONSERVATION CORPS COULD EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FUNDING BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. FINALLY ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION THIS BILL IS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ANY DECREASE IN SALES AND USE TAX REVENUE. ALTHOUGH THE BILL WOULD CHANGE THE ENTITY. THE CHARGES ZERO V. FROM CAL RECYCLE TO THE STORAGE OF ORGANIZATION. IT'S STILL BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE GROSS RECEIPTS FOR THE CALCULATION OF SALES AND USE TAX WHEN APPLICABLE THANK YOU.

HOWEVER ACADEMIC RESEARCH RIGHT ROCK NINETY FOUR SHOWS CRIMINALS CHOOSE VICTIMS WERE WEAKER VULNERABLE AND ON ARTS ADJUSTING OUR MOTHERS AND ALL. I RESEARCH WHY CRIME INCREASE.

IGNORING CRIMINOLOGY BEAUTIFIED OF SUPPORTING RIMINAL AND SUPPORTING HI NOT CHANGE DATA CLIENT. MAKES A MOCKERY OF ALL SCIENCE. BUT CRIME IS IN THE HEART NOT THE COLOR OF THE SKIN FATHERLESS HOUSEHOLDS EXPLAIN MORE VARIATION OF OUTCOMES AND REYES. THE POOR SINGLE MOM IS THE TOUGHEST JOB IN THE WORLD- IT'S NEVER OKAY TO HIT SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ROBBING.

TWO SIX TWO YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO GO TO THE OPPOSITION I KNOW WE HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS- A RYAN COUSINS HIS ASSISTANT CHIEF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF YOLO COUNTY. MR COUSINS YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES PLEASE- TELL US YOUR POSITION. GOOD MORNING DISTINGUISHED PANEL. THE FISCAL IMPACT OF S. B. TWO SIXTY TWO COMES FROM THE FACT. BUT IT TAKES DISCRETION AWAY FROM JUDGES TO POTENTIALLY SET A DIFFERENT BILL IF THERE'S A SAFETY RISK OR A FLIGHT RISK THE AMENDMENTS TO THE PENAL CODE SECTION TWELVE SIXTY NINE BE. SAY IF A CRIME IS NOT ON THE LIST IT'S ZERO BAIL THIS ACTUALLY CREATES A ZERO BAIL LOOPHOLE BECAUSE IF YOUR CRIME IS NOT ON THE LIST. WHICH IS FINE IF YOU YOU'RE GIVEN THAT CHANCE TO SHOW UP IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP A WARRANT IS ISSUED. IN THE AMOUNT OF ZERO BAIL AGAIN EVEN A FAILURE TO APPEAR IS ZERO BAIL. SO THEORETICALLY PEOPLE WOULD BE STUCK IN A LOOPHOLE WHERE IF THEIR CRIME IS ON THE LIST. THEY COULD NEVER SHOW UP FOR COURT. THE IF THIS CAUSES EVEN A 10% INCREASE IN FAILURES TO APPEAR. THIS WOULD COST AT A MARGINAL áP MARGINAL COST FOR THE POLICE RESPONSE TO ADDRESSING FTAS WOULD BE. IN MY OPINION A MINIMUM ONE POINT THREE TWO TWO TOTAL ANNUALLY- BUT THE GREATER RISK COMES FROM THE CRIMES THAT WOULD BE COMMITTED WHILE PEOPLE ARE OUT ON ZERO BAIL WE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE THIS DURING KOBE- IN YOLO COUNTY WHERE PRACTICE WE HAD OVER EIGHT HUNDRED. CRIMES COMMITTED BY PEOPLE RELEASED ON ZERO BAIL IF YOU LOOK AT THE ZERO BILL EMERGENCY SCHEDULES COUNTY TO COUNTY I DID NOT LOOK AT ALL OF THEM BUT I TOOK A CROSS SECTION. THEY MORE OR LESS MIRROR THE CRIME LIST OF THIS BILL- BUT IN EVEN A SMALL COUNTY REPRESENTING ONE HALF OF 1% OF THE POPULATION THAT WAS OVER EIGHT HUNDRED CRIMES 43% SAN FRANCISCO SIMILE RELEASED ON ZERO BAIL- WERE RE ARRESTED THAT THEY ONLY HAD ZERO BAIL FOR A TWO MONTH PERIOD. SO WITH THIS EXTRAPOLATED IS THAT THE MARGINAL COST TO RESPOND TO PROPERTY CRIMES TWELVE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR DOLLARS VIOLENT CRIMES TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THIS WOULD EXTRAPOLATE TO AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION IN ADDITIONAL ANNUAL COSTS MARGINALLY FOR THE POLICE RESPONSE- AND THEN THAT'S ONLY IF EVERY NEW CRIME WAS A PROPERTY CRIME WHICH YOU WOULDN'T BE. IF YOU DIVIDED THAT BETWEEN PROPERTY CRIME AND VIOLENT CRIME THE MARGINAL COST INCREASE WOULD BE ONE POINT ZERO ONE BILLION FOR POLICE RESPONSE TO THESE NEW CRIMES. AND THEN USING CALIFORNIA VICTIMS OF CRIME BOARD STATISTICS IF ONLY 10% OF THE NEW CRIMES COMMITTED BY THOSE ON ZERO BAIL INVOLVED VICTIMS WHO APPLIED FOR RELIEF. JUST COST OF TWENTY ONE POINT FOUR EIGHT MILLION ANNUALLY SO AGAIN THE PROBLEM IS THIS ZERO BAIL LOOPHOLE THAT'S RELEASED THE JUDGES WOULD BE POWERLESS. TO TAKE SOMEBODY WHO IS EVEN A FLIGHT RISK OR A SECURITY RISK AND SET A DIFFERENT KIND OF BAIL UNDER THIS SCHEDULE WHICH HAS SOME SERIOUS CRIMES ASSAULT WITH FORCE LIKELY TO CAUSE GREAT BODILY INJURY EVEN IF IT IS A HATE CRIME IS ZERO BAIL. UNDER THIS SCHEDULE. I CAN ANSWER ANY. ROM THE COMMITTEE ON HOW I REACHED- MY NUMBERS.
