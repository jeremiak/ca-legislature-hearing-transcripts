00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:25.478
DO. WOULD IT BE HELPFUL IF I

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:28.014
TURNED OFF MY VIDEO. THAT

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.082
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN OKAY THAT

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:34.487
WITHOUT HELP. ALL YOU NEED A

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:38.724
VERY. NOW RIGHT OKAY TRY TO

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:41.127
LET'S TRY WE YOU TO W. AND OUT

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:42.228
OR WILL WE MIGHT ASK YOU AFTER

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:46.766
THIS SO WE'LL KEEP GOING. SO

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:47.967
CLOSER TO MY MAKERS IS NOT A

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:52.104
WHOLE. I'M SO THE FREE EVERY.

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:53.005
THE THING OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:55.174
FUNDING IS NOT RECEIVED IN THE

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.442
SAME FISCAL YEAR THAT THE

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.611
SPENDING IS DONE. AND SO THEY

00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:00.012
DIDN'T THAT IMPACTS THE STATE

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.514
BUDGET IN IN THE SENSE THAT WE

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.883
HAVE TO DO KIND OF THEM ALMOST

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.751
A YEAR BALANCING OF. THE

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:07.220
EXPENDITURES ON DISASTER

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:09.555
RESPONSE WITH WHEN WE EXPECT TO

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:11.424
RECEIVE THAT REIMBURSEMENT

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.492
REVENUE IN. NOW THEN OBVIOUSLY

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:14.794
THE HIGHER THE AMOUNT OF

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.329
ESTIMATED FUTURE REIMBURSEMENTS

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:18.030
FROM DISASTERS THAT TAKE PLACE

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:21.734
THE LARGER THE IMPACT IS ON AN

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:22.368
INDIAN INTERPLAY WITH THE STATE

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:25.738
BUDGET. SO THAT KIND OF SITTING

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:28.574
CONTACTS FOR- EXPLAINING HOW

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:29.809
SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:33.045
REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS. MAKE

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:33.579
MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:37.183
CHALLENGE. TO ESTIMATE AND-

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.919
PROJECT. THE IMPACTS AND WHEN

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:41.687
THEY'RE GONNA BE FELT SO SOME

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:43.823
OF THE FEMUR PROCESS IT IT'S

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.491
VERY COMPLEX AND THERE ARE A

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:46.659
LOT OF DETAILS THAT HAVE TO BE

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:48.294
ASSESSED AND CONSIDERED WHEN

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.395
WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHICH

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:51.397
SPECIFIC COSTS ARE GOING TO BE

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:53.199
ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT. AND

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:54.533
IT TAKES SOME TIME TO BE ABLE

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.102
TO DETERMINE THE MAGNITUDE OF

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:57.003
THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:58.271
WE'RE GOING TO GET FROM FEMA

00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:00.039
REIMBURSEMENT AND- THAT KIND OF

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:02.041
GOES ALONG. ALONG WITH THE

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:03.242
RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT FEMA

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:04.877
WOULD REIMBURSE A 100% FOR%

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:07.880
CERTAIN PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES.

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:08.881
GIVEN THE COMPLEXITIES OF

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:10.182
DETERMINING ELIGIBLE COSTS IT'S

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:11.851
IT IS THERE'S A PROCESS TO

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.753
CHALLENGE PROCESS AT THAT.

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:14.654
DETERMINE THE IMPACTS OF THE

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.357
CHANGE FROM SAY 75% A 100% AS

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:19.625
WITH THE OTHER CHALLENGES AND

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:21.727
JUST DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:26.165
OVERALL- OTHER KIND OF

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.733
CONSIDERATION THIS IS MORE

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.202
COVERT SPECIFIC AND THEN IT IS

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:31.604
IN GENERAL DISASTER BUT ONE OF

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.139
THE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IS

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:33.639
THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.308
DISASTER FEMA REIMBURSEMENT

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:37.777
ISN'T THE ONLY SOURCE FOR

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.912
FINDING IN PLAY AND SO PART OF

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:40.846
THE COMPLEXITY IN THIS

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:42.648
PARTICULAR PROCESS IS BOUNCING

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:44.016
THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:45.618
VARIOUS TYPES OF FEDERAL FUNDS

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:47.086
FOR EXAMPLE THE CURRENT VIRUS

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:48.988
REALLY FIND- AND A FEW OTHER

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:50.589
SOURCES OF FEDERAL FUNDS THAT

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:51.357
HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE MADE

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.192
AVAILABLE TO THE STATE TO HELP

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.660
WITH PUBLIC COSTS. BUT THE

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.262
ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING VERY

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:58.030
HARD TO MAXIMIZE OUR USE OF

00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.532
FEDERAL FUNDING OVERALL FOUND

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:00.666
PART OF THAT IS JUST FIGURING

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.468
OUT WHERE THE PIECES OF THE

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:03.102
DIFFERENT FEDERAL FUNDING

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.504
PASSED THAT- AND THAT AND THAT

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:07.039
ALSO HELPS IS TO MINIMIZE THE

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.941
RISK OF HAVING FEMA CLAIMS BE

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:10.409
REDUCED OR DENIED BECAUSE OF

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:11.477
ANY SORT OF LEVEL OF AN

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:12.712
ELIGIBLE COSTS BE INCLUDED

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:16.582
WITHIN. A PARTICULAR CLAIM

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:17.616
APPLICATION. AND SO THERE'S A

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:18.584
COUPLE DIFFERENT AND VERY

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:20.152
ACCESS SEVERAL NUMBER. THAT CAN

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:21.988
AFFECT. THE AMOUNT A FEW MARIA.

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.389
I WILL GET ON JUST A COUPLE

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.091
HIGH LEVEL- PRIMARY

00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:26.592
CONSIDERATIONS ARE OF COURSE

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:27.560
YOU TALK ABOUT ELIGIBILITY

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:30.129
LITTLE BIT- FEMA COSTS HAVE TO

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:32.031
BE. MEET THE FEMA GUIDELINES

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:33.299
WHICH ARE FAIRLY BROAD AND

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:35.001
THERE'S FAIR ROOM FOR

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:36.836
INTERPRETATION. AND I THINK

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:37.970
IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT IN

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:40.206
COVERT NINETEEN. THIS IS A NEW

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:41.273
TYPE OF DISASTER FOR FEMALE

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.375
JUST LIKE IT IS FOR THE STATE

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:44.076
OF EVERY STATE AND LOCALS AND

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.345
EVERYBODY ELSE. SO SOME OF THAT

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:48.047
COMPLEXITY IS A LITTLE BIT

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:49.515
DEEPENED BY THE FACT THAT

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:50.983
PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO FIGURE.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.018
OUT HOW TO APPLY CERTAIN

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:56.322
GUIDELINES. THANKS. TO THIS

00:10:56.389 --> 00:11:00.593
KIND OF NEW SITUATION AS WELL.

00:11:00.659 --> 00:11:02.895
I HAVE BEEN IN. IS THAT IT'S

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.397
ALSO THE CORPORATION WHICH IS

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:06.532
NOT. CONTINUE CONCEPT IT WE DO

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:07.600
AT THE STATE LEVEL TO WHERE

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.035
VARIOUS THINGS ARE ARE MADE

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:09.702
AVAILABLE SUBJECT TO

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:11.804
APPROPRIATION. BUT THAT MEANS

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:13.906
THAT- WITHOUT ADEQUATE YOU KNOW

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:15.374
FUNDING BEING PROVIDED BY.

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:18.511
CONGRESS THEN OBVIOUSLY THE

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:20.146
AVAILABILITY OF- FUNDING FOR

00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:23.682
FEMA TO REIMBURSE US- I CAN IN

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:25.551
IMPACT THE TIMING I DON'T KNOW

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:27.353
THE MEANING- YES CAN TALK MORE

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:27.920
TO THIS WHEN THEY DO CAN BE

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.121
GENERAL OVERVIEW AFTER

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.723
QUESTIONS WITHIN GENERALLY IT'S

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.291
A MATTER OF TIMING AND THAT CAN

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.959
RELATE IN SOME OF THE DELAYS

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:36.295
WHICH ALSO IMPACTS THE- THE

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.064
STATE BUDGET. AND THEN ALSO

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.498
JUST KIND OF A LAST POINT TO

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:41.534
MAKE IS THAT FEMA FUNDING ISN'T

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.135
JUST AVAILABLE SPECIFIC TO COPE

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:45.171
WITH NINETEEN SO. THE FUNDING

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:47.006
THAT IS AVAILABLE TO FEMA TO

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:49.308
SUPPORT REIMBURSEMENTS- IS

DISASTERS THAT WOULD INCLUDE

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.446
YOU KNOW WILDFIRES AND

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:54.814

EARTHQUAKES FLOODS. YOU NAME

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:57.883
IT- AND THEN IT'S ALSO

AVAILABLE ACROSS IN ALL FIFTY

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:01.120
STATES SOME SOME OTHER US

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:03.355
TERRITORIES AND SO YOU KNOW

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:05.724
KIND OF. COMPETING FOR RESOURCE

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:06.926
PERSPECTIVE IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:08.227
WE'RE WORKING. WITH OTHER

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:10.396
STATES IN AND LOCAL ENTITIES

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:12.198
WITHIN OUR STATE- THOSE ROCK

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:13.432
AND WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:14.233
PART OF FEMA FUNDING SO THEIR

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.601

USED THROUGH THIS- AND I

00:47:52.135 --> 00:47:53.470

ABOUT IT RIGHT IT'S NOT A

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.794
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE MERGING SEA-

00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:19.096
THAT THEN THEY CAN JUST GET

00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:20.697
SPENT WITHOUT ANY KIND OF

00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:22.032
FURTHER APPROVAL BY THE

00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:25.936
GUESS I'M TRYING TO GET A

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:29.539
PICTURE OF HOW MUCH AUTHORITY.

00:48:29.606 --> 00:48:31.942
IN TERMS OF AMOUNT OF MONEY AND

00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:34.478
HOW IT CAN BE SPENT WHERE DOES

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:36.613
THE VOICE OF THE LEGISLATURE-

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.149
COME INTO THIS PROCESS- BECAUSE

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:42.152

TO SPEAK A BIT TO THAT- ONE

00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:55.098
PIECE OF CONTEXT THAT I THINK

00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:57.501
IS HELPFUL TO KNOW IS THAT ON

00:48:57.567 --> 00:49:00.804
WALL STATUTE SAYS THAT ONLY

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:02.973
NOTIFICATION IS REQUIRED IT IS

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.441
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT-

00:49:04.508 --> 00:49:07.044
TYPICALLY IF JAIL B. C. RAISES

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:08.645
OBJECTION TO SOMETHING THAT THE

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:10.013

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.481
THEM ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:13.183
WILL OFTEN RECONSIDER IT THOUGH

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:14.818
IT'S CRITICAL TO KNOW. THEY ARE

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:16.453
NOT LEGALLY REQUIRED TO

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.022
RECONSIDER IT SO IN SOME WAYS

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:20.724
THAT CAN'T THAT DOES PROVIDE

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.858
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:23.627
LEGISLATURE TO RAISE CONCERNS

00:49:23.694 --> 00:49:25.529
THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE PROCESS

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:27.731
THOUGH AS I MENTIONED IT'S NOT

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.733
REQUIRED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.736
TO ADHERE TO ANY OBJECTIONS

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:33.570
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT HAVE.

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:35.772
IN TERMS OF THE ROLE OF THE

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:37.407
LEGISLATURE REALLY VARIES

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:39.843
DEPENDING ON WHAT SPECIFIC

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.878

00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:28.852
UTILIZING IT EMERGENCY ROOMS

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:31.521
ACT SERVICES ACT HAS BEEN DONE

00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:33.223
THROUGH THE TRIO MECHANISM THE

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.958
CODE NINETEEN OF LAST YEAR AND

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:36.827
THAT HAS TOTALED ABOUT SEVEN

00:51:36.893 --> 00:51:38.328
POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. AND

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:40.330
THE REMAINDER OF THAT- EIGHT

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:42.699
POINT ONE ROUGHLY IS WHAT WAS

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:43.900
DONE THROUGH THE CONTROL

00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:45.202
SECTION THIRTY SIX IN THE

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:47.370
BUDGET AFTER THOSE NINETEEN AS

00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:48.705
WELL AS A COUPLE OF-

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:50.907
APPROPRIATIONS THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:52.309
INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY

00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:55.111
BY STAFF. IN TERMS OF AMOUNTS

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:58.548
THOSE ARE THE AMOUNTS. THAT

00:51:58.615 --> 00:51:59.182
HAVE BEEN USED TO THIS PROCESS.

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:00.684
TERMS OF NEW. I THINK THE L. A.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.653
O. IS CORRECT IN THAT. THE

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.755
STATUTE. OF THE BAR THAT IT

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:06.456
SETS IN TERMS OF WHAT'S

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:09.459
REQUIRED- IS PRETTY LOW BUT I

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:11.361
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT

00:52:11.428 --> 00:52:13.463
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. GONE

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:17.267
WELL ABOVE. THAT BAR BY MAKING

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:18.568
SURE THAT WE- DO WHAT'S

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:19.769
REQUIRED NOTIFICATION LETTERS

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:21.438
BUT WE'VE ALSO SET UP THE EVERY

00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:22.873
TWO MONTHS WILL UPDATES WE'VE

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:25.475
DONE BRIEFINGS. AND THE L. O.

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:27.143
U. S. HAS DONE- REGULAR

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.446
BRIEFINGS WITH MEMBERS ON

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:30.447
VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:32.415
THE LAST YEAR. AS THINGS

00:52:32.482 --> 00:52:34.150
INVOLVED WITH CODE NINETEEN.

00:52:34.217 --> 00:52:36.553
AND FINANCES DONE- BRIEFINGS

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.388
WITH NUMBERS. AS A NEW

00:52:38.455 --> 00:52:41.625
ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED

00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:42.192
INCOME FORWARD. AND THEN WE

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:43.860
CONTINUE TO THE FISCAL SO I

00:52:43.927 --> 00:52:45.829
THINK THE IN THE ONLY WORK.

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:46.496
WHICH IS ON THE STUDENTS ME

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:50.133
THAT LIKE SUPER. WE GET THAT

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.334
MANY PRECIADO MEDIA DISCUSS

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:53.770
MORE. WITH LAW REQUIRES BUT

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:56.239
ALSO TO MAKE SURE THIS CAN THAT

00:52:56.306 --> 00:52:57.607
ADMINISTRATION IS GOING WELL

00:52:57.674 --> 00:52:59.543
BEYOND JUST THAT BARE MINIMUM

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:00.710
IS ALLEGED THAT THE LAW.

00:53:00.777 --> 00:53:03.480
REQUIRES YOU KNOWLEDGE IN THE

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:08.084
NEED. TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP

00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:08.885
WITH THE LEGISLATURE. OF COURSE

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:10.387
OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT.

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:11.655
SOMETHING LIKE THE PANDEMIC

00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:13.523
THAT NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA FROM

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.292
WEEK TO WEEK MONTH TO MONTH A

00:53:15.358 --> 00:53:16.560
LOT OF THINGS THAT WILL BE

00:53:16.626 --> 00:53:17.494
HAPPENING AND WE'RE TRYING OUR

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.262
BEST THAT. MINISTRATIONS TRYING

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:22.132
THEIR BEST. OF BUT WE ALL

00:53:22.198 --> 00:53:23.033
REPRESENT DIFFERENT PARTS OF

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:25.535
THE STATE WHERE- THE ISSUE

00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:27.404
COULD HAVE A DIFFERENT IMPACT.

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:28.338
A DIFFERENT PART OF THE

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:30.173
POPULATION IN THE RESIDENTS AND

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.743
SO- IT IT REALLY MAKES A

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:34.744
DIFFERENCE TO BE ABLE TO VOICE

00:53:34.811 --> 00:53:36.880
THAT. WE COULD SEE THAT EVERY

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:39.549
IN EVERY ISSUE AND- IMPACTED BY

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:42.786
THE PANDEMIC- OKAY POLICE ANY

00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:44.821
OTHER ON THIS WE'LL WE'LL GET

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:47.390
THROUGH THE- REST OF THE-

00:53:47.457 --> 00:53:48.291
FUNDING MECHANISMS AND

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:52.629
AUTHORITY. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:57.067
THEN THAT'S THE- NUMBER. YOU

00:53:57.133 --> 00:54:02.138
SHOULD NINE. DO WE GO TO EVERY

00:54:02.205 --> 00:54:06.443
YEAR WE GET THAT OKAY ISSUE NO

00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:10.580
NINE ISSUE NINE OKAY YES LIST

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:12.649
WAUKESHA NINE PLEASE. IN STEVEN

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:15.719
APARTMENT- ISSUE NINE IS IN

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.754
REGARDS TO CONTROL SECTION

00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:20.190
ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE. THAT WAS

00:54:20.256 --> 00:54:20.724
PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:23.126
BUDGET. THAT CONTROL SECTION

00:54:23.193 --> 00:54:25.195
INCLUDES TWO COMPONENTS THAT

00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:26.796
ARE BOTH AIMED AT FACILITATING

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:29.399
ADAPTING THE STATE SCHOOL WOULD

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:30.200
NINETEEN DIRECT RESPONSE

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:32.202
FUNDING ANY. NEEDS AT THEIR

00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:34.137
FUNDING AS THE NEEDS OF ALSO

00:54:34.204 --> 00:54:36.272
MENTIONED. PREVIOUSLY THE

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:38.274
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:40.977
INCLUDES ONE POINT FOUR BILLION

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:43.713
DOLLARS THAT- PROPOSED IN ITEMS

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.882
APPROPRIATION WITHIN SPECIFIC

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:47.917
DEPARTMENT BUDGETS. THE FIRST

00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:49.619
COMPONENT OF CONTROL SECTION

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:52.055
ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE. PROVIDES

00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:55.458
THE ABILITY FOR THE FUNDING TO

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:57.193
BE TRANSFERRED BETWEEN THE

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.662
ITEMS FOR RESPECTIVE

00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:00.630
DEPARTMENTS AND THE REASON

00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:03.767
BEHIND THAT PROPOSAL. IS THAT

00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:05.068
WE HAVE FOUND THROUGH THE

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:07.370
THROUGH THE PANDEMIC IS THAT

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:08.705
SOMETIMES THE DEPARTMENT THAT

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:10.073
WE THINK IS GOING TO BE NEEDED

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.442
TO SAY CONTRACT FOR A SIMPLE

00:55:12.509 --> 00:55:13.677
EXAMPLE PERHAPS SHOULD BE

00:55:13.743 --> 00:55:15.612
CONTRACTING FOR NURSING STAFF

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:17.080
THAT'S BEEN USED FOR BOTH

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:19.149
HOSPITAL MEDICAL SURGE IN THIS

00:55:19.215 --> 00:55:20.550
AND RECENTLY FOR VACCINE

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:23.219
DISTRIBUTION ADMINISTRATION. SO

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:25.288
THOSE CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY-

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:27.924
HELD BY EITHER DEPARTMENT OF

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:30.427
PUBLIC HEALTH WERE THE ANSWER.

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:33.029
AND SOMETIMES WHICH DEPARTMENT

00:55:33.096 --> 00:55:34.330
NEEDS TO BE IN A CONTRACT CAN

00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:36.366
CAN VERY SO THE IDEA BEHIND

00:55:36.433 --> 00:55:38.401
THIS PROVISION IN THE CONTROL

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:39.869
SECTION IS TO SAY THAT IF WE

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:43.973
WERE. REVERBERATED FUNDING FOR

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.042
AN ACTIVITY IN STATE DEPARTMENT

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:47.811
PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGET BUT IT

00:55:47.877 --> 00:55:50.146
TURNS OUT THAT MS A NEEDS TO BE

00:55:50.213 --> 00:55:51.881
THE DEPARTMENT TO ENTER THE

00:55:51.948 --> 00:55:52.882
CONTRACT ACTUALLY EXPEND THE

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:54.984
FUNDS. IT GIVES US THE ABILITY

00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:56.753
TO MOVE THE FUNDING BETWEEN THE

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.054
DEPARTMENTS IT WOULD BE FOR THE

00:55:58.121 --> 00:56:00.356
SAME ACTIVITIES BUT IT ALLOWS

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:01.257
IT TO BE MOVED BETWEEN

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:02.525
DEPARTMENTS IF THE DEPARTMENT

00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:03.560
THAT NEEDS TO MAKE THE

00:56:03.626 --> 00:56:06.863
EXPENDITURE CHANGES. AS THE

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:08.798
ENDEMIC KIND OF EVOLVES.

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:12.035
RESPONSE RESPONSES PENTECOST-

00:56:12.102 --> 00:56:13.870
IT ALSO WOULD ALLOW FOR THE-

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:15.939
DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO DECREASE

00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:17.040
THE AMOUNT THREE IN THOSE ITEMS

00:56:17.107 --> 00:56:19.075
I KNOW THAT IT DOES NOT.

00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:20.810
PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO INCREASE

00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:22.345
I THINK THAT'S WORTH NOTING BUT

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:24.047
IT DOES ALLOW THAT. THE ABILITY

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:25.281
TO DECREASE AND THE IDEA BEHIND

00:56:25.348 --> 00:56:27.050
THAT IS TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:30.220
WE KNOWLEDGE THAT OUR COST

00:56:30.286 --> 00:56:30.720
ESTIMATES ARE JUST THAT

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:32.288
ESTIMATES- YOUR FINGERS

00:56:32.355 --> 00:56:33.757
CROSSED. THINGS WILL GO EVEN

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:35.058
BETTER THAN THE ESTIMATES

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:36.926
ASSUME AND MAYBE WE WON'T NEED

00:56:36.993 --> 00:56:37.527
TO SPEND ALL OF THE ESTIMATED

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:39.295
FUNDING. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:40.163
IT WOULD GIVE US THE ABILITY TO

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:41.698
REMOVE SOME OF THAT FORTY FROM

00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:43.299
DEPARTMENTS BUDGETS IF IT'S NOT

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:44.501
IF IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THERE.

00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:46.269
BASED ON HOW THAT THE ENDEMIC

00:56:46.336 --> 00:56:49.005
EVOLVES. THE SECOND COMPONENT

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:51.508
OF CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:52.242
NINE ONE IS SPECIFICALLY

00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:54.477
RELATED TO FEDERAL AND PRIVATE

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:58.114
FUNDS- MR SODERBERGH- LOOTED

00:56:58.181 --> 00:56:59.549
EARLIER TO- THERE FREQUENTLY

00:56:59.616 --> 00:57:02.685
pCOMES. AVAILABLE OUTSIDE OF THE

00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:03.987
PERIOD WITHIN THE BUDGET CAN

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:05.555
ANTICIPATE- CONTEMPLATE. THIS

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:08.424
INCLUSION- NORMALLY THAT WOULD

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:09.359
BE HANDLED THROUGH CONTROL

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:11.161
SECTION TWENTY EIGHT I THINK.

00:57:11.227 --> 00:57:12.829
WE PROPOSED THIS PORTION OF A

00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:15.732
LOT CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:18.134
POINT NINE ONE- BECAUSE SECTION

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:19.402
TWENTY EIGHT KIND OF TYPICALLY

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:21.471
IS CONTEMPLATING IN A ONE OFF

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:23.573
DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC INCREASES

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.607
AND GENERALLY NOT TO THE

00:57:24.674 --> 00:57:26.075
MAGNITUDE OF THE A LARGE

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:27.177
FEDERAL PACKAGE LIKE THE KERRS

00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:28.578
ACTOR OTHER THINGS THAT COME

00:57:28.645 --> 00:57:29.646
OUT NOT THAT IT COULDN'T BE

00:57:29.712 --> 00:57:32.749
ADAPTED TO. BE USED THAT WAY

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:34.350
BUT OUR PERSPECTIVE WAS THAT.

00:57:34.417 --> 00:57:35.852
WITH THE PANDEMIC LONG THIS

00:57:35.919 --> 00:57:38.188
FUNDING IS COMING IN FOR

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:40.089
ACTIVITIES THAT NEED TO BE.

00:57:40.156 --> 00:57:42.058
ROLLED OUT FIRST WANTED TO

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:44.093
IMMEDIATELY AND THE SCALE IN

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.261
TERMS OF BOTH THE NUMBER OF

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:47.897
DEPARTMENTS IMPACTED AND THE

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:49.532
RELATIVELY LARGE SO WE PROPOSED

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:50.667
THIS CONTROL SECTION AS A

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:52.535
ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF. BEING

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:53.937
ABLE TO MAKE FEDERAL FUNDING

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:55.238
THAT HAS IDENTIFIED FOUR

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:57.273
SPECIFIC PERSON PURPOSES.

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.208
AVAILABLE FOR THOSE SPECIFIC

00:57:58.274 --> 00:58:00.343
PURPOSES- A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:03.446
SWIFTLY- THE CRITERIA OF

00:58:03.513 --> 00:58:06.115
CONDITIONS THAT NEED TO BE MET.

00:58:06.182 --> 00:58:07.517
FOR THIS CONTROL SECTION BE

00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:08.952
USED ARE VERY SIMILAR. TO

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:10.386
CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT SO

00:58:10.453 --> 00:58:12.555
IT STILL REQUIRES THAT IT THE

00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:15.124
FUNDS THAT ARE- BEING EXPENDED

00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:17.093
SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPORT THE

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.027
STATE'S RESPONSE TO COVERT

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:20.330
NINETEEN. I WOULD REQUIRE THAT

00:58:20.396 --> 00:58:20.897
THEY BE CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:23.333
LAW. WE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:24.267
FUNDS ARE BEING PROVIDED

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:26.202
SPECIFICALLY FOR AND ARE BEING

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:29.472
EXPANDED SPECIFICALLY FOR. THE

00:58:29.539 --> 00:58:31.274
NINETEEN- AND THEN FINALLY- IT

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:32.375
HAS TO BE REQUIRES THAT THE

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:34.143
ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE FUNDS WOULD

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:35.678
NOT REQUIRE THE STATE TO COMMIT

00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:36.980
OR EXPAND IN ANY OTHER STATE

00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:38.281
FUNDS. SO VERY SIMILAR

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:39.983
REQUIREMENTS OR CONDITIONS TO

00:58:40.049 --> 00:58:41.584
CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT-

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:43.186
OUR THOUGHT PROCESS ON THIS

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:45.088
COMPONENT AGAIN WHICH WAS TO

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:47.790
ALLOW FOR. A WAY TO BRING IN

00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:49.559
AND USE QUICKLY WHAT WE EXPECT

00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:51.261
TO BE CAN BE LARGER THAN THE

00:58:51.327 --> 00:58:53.062
TYPICALLY- INTUBATED TYPE OF

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:54.097
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE LIKE THE

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:55.331
CARS AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:59.068
IF IT WERE IF ANOTHER PACKAGE

00:58:59.135 --> 00:58:59.636
WOULD COME. FROM THE FEDERAL

00:58:59.702 --> 00:59:02.071
GOVERNMENT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY

00:59:02.138 --> 00:59:06.276
MUCH THE LA- PLEASE. SORT OF

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:08.211
BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:10.546
OFFICE ON SO THE FIRST

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:12.782
COMPONENT ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:14.350
THAT ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION

00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:16.019
TO SHIFT FUNDS BETWEEN TWELVE

00:59:16.085 --> 00:59:18.154
DEPARTMENTS- WHAT MADE MY

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.322
COMMENTS WILL BE FOCUSED ON

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:21.057
THAT FIRST WEEK WE THINK IT'S

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:22.325
REASONABLE TO PROVIDE THE

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:23.893
ADMINISTRATION SOME FLEXIBILITY

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.628
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:27.730
ON KNOWN ABOUT THE PANDEMIC.

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:29.465
HOWEVER WE FEEL THAT THIS

00:59:29.532 --> 00:59:30.800
SECTION PROVIDES SO MUCH

00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:31.935
FLEXIBILITY THAT WOULD BE

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:33.603
DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:35.104
TO KNOW HOW BUDGETED FUNDS WILL

00:59:35.171 --> 00:59:36.940
ACTUALLY BE SPENT OR EVEN WHICH

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:38.308
DEPARTMENTS WILL ULTIMATELY

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:40.310
RECEIVE THE FUNDS AS THE

00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:41.778
CONTROL SECTION DOES NOT

00:59:41.844 --> 00:59:43.646
REQUIRE A NOTIFICATION

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:46.649
REQUIREMENT. IN OUR IN ADDITION

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:48.785
THE SECTION ALLOWS FUNDS TO BE

00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:50.620
PROVIDED TO THREE DEPARTMENTS

00:59:50.687 --> 00:59:51.621
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF

00:59:51.688 --> 00:59:53.189
PLANNING RESEARCH THE EMERGENCY

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:54.958
MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. AND

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:56.492
THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT WHOSE

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:57.927
RESPONSE ACTIVITIES HAVEN'T

00:59:57.994 --> 01:00:00.063
BEEN IDENTIFIED YET AS SUCH THE

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:01.931
LEGISLATURE ONE HAVE A SENSE OF

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:04.133
HOW THE FUNDS WOULD BE USED IF

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:04.701
THEY WERE PROVIDED TO THOSE

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.403
DEPARTMENTS- ACCORDINGLY WE

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:08.171
RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:10.406
SECTION. TO REQUIRE THE

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.075
LEGISLATURE TO BE NOTIFIED WHEN

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:13.843
FUNDS ARE TRANSFERRED AND BE

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:17.847
PROVIDED INFORMATION ABOUT- HOW

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:18.414
THE FUNDS WILL BE USED WHEN

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:19.215
THEY'RE TRANSFERRED. WITH

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:20.984
RESPECT TO THE SECOND COMPONENT

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.418
THAT GIVES THE ADMINISTRATION

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:24.554
FLEXIBILITY TO RECEIVE. FEDERAL

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.856
AND PRIVATE FUNDS WE RECOMMEND

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:28.458
REJECTING THIS COMPONENT OF

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:30.193
CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN NINE

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:33.029
ONE- BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:35.031
SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF WHAT'S

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:36.199
REALLY ALREADY A VERY VERY

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:38.267
BROAD AUTHORITY UNDER CONTROL

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:41.304
SECTION TWENTY EIGHT- WE- ARE

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:43.039
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME OF

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:45.108
THE FOUGHT BEHIND- THE CONTROL

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:46.909
SECTION ELEVEN NINE ONE

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:47.677
FLEXIBILITY TO RECEIVE FEDERAL

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:50.546
FUNDS. WAS THAT IT WOULD

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:51.981
EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. BUT WE

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:53.783
REALLY FIND THAT THERE'S NO

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.985
NEED TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS-

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.253
BECAUSE THAT'S ALREADY

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.355
AVAILABLE UNDER CONTROL SECTION

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:00.790
TWENTY EIGHT- THE OTHER THING

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:02.458
THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO NOTE

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.127
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.828
CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN NINE ONE

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.130
AND CONTROL SECTION TWENTY

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:08.131
EIGHT IS ELEVEN NINE ONE WOULD

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.832
NOT REQUIRE ANY LEGISLATIVE

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:11.667
NOTIFICATION. WORDS CONTROL

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:13.202
SECTION TWENTY EIGHT WOULD IF

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:15.204
IT'S A BUT IF IT'S FUNDING

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.407
ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD. ON

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:19.242
AND SO WE FEEL THAT THE CURRENT

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:20.510
PROCESS IS SUFFICIENT

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:22.078
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IT HAS

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:23.946
SAFEGUARDS BUILT IN TO ALLOW

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:26.015
FOR EXPEDITED APPLICATIONS AS

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:28.985
NECESSARY AND THOSE THOSE-

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.220
EXPEDITED ALLOCATIONS HAVE BEEN

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:31.988
MADE THROUGHOUT THAT CODE

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:35.058
NINETEEN. PANDEMIC AS NEEDED.

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:36.526
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:40.329
THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF SO

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:41.864
ALONG THOSE LINES IF WE COULD

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:45.168
GET THE DEPARTMENT OF- FINANCE

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:46.569
BUT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:48.371
USING THE EXISTING BUDGET

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.440
CONTROL SECTIONSTO. ALLOCATE

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:52.475
OR REALLOCATE ON GENERAL FUND

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:56.846
MONEY. SO WE FOUND IN VARIOUS

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.548
THINGS DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:00.183
THAT- SOME OF THE RESPONSE

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:01.884
ACTIVITIES REQUIRED FOR

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:04.120
IMMEDIATE ACTION AND SO THAT'S

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:05.488
THAT'S WHERE W WERE COMING

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:08.357
FROM WHERE POSING A LOAN POINT

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:09.826
NINE WONDER THAT THAT COMPONENT.

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.194
END OF IT IS THAT IT ALLOWS FOR

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.496
A MORE IMMEDIATE. USE OF THE

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.298
FEDERAL FUNDING AS THEY COME IN

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.799
THAT WAS THAT'S LARGELY THE AND

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:19.602
THEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER- I

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:21.504
THINK TYPICALLY CONSTRUCTION

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.507
TWENTY EIGHT OF THE BUDGET ACT.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:26.042
TYPICALLY DOESN'T CONTEMPLATE-

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:27.743
I THINK ASK FEDERAL PACKAGES OF

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.745
THE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT WE

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:30.947
WOULD YOU KNOW THAT YOU MAY GET

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:32.682
FROM CODE NINETEEN NINETY CAN

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:33.783
THINK WITH CARES ACT NUMBER

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.751
DEPARTMENTS IMPACTED IN THAT

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:36.419
AND THE SIZE OF THE AMOUNT THAT

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:39.055
COMES IN- AND THEN AGAIN BAKER

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:40.022
SAID BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE IT

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:42.558
ON A- MEDIA BASIS FOR IMMEDIATE

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:45.027
NEEDS. AND COVERED THAT WAS THE

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:47.396
CONTEXT WERE COMING FROM- AND

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:48.464
AGAIN YOU KNOW WE'RE WE WERE

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:50.099
DRAFTING THIS CONTROL SECTION

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:52.702
IN MID DECEMBER- WHEN WE ARE

01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:55.805
TALKING ABOUT TO FACE- AND THE

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.673
MOST RECENT SURGE WE HAD AND

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.075
THE OTHERS. AND CONTINUED

01:02:59.142 --> 01:02:59.976
UNCERTAINTIES ONE WAY SO WE'RE

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:01.744
COMING FROM A CONTEXT AND IS

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:04.680
WELL. OF THE MEDIA. MEDIA

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:07.550
ATTENTION NEEDED THEIR- I WOULD

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.152
LIKE TO KNOW THE CA SEX WELL IT

01:03:09.218 --> 01:03:12.655
DOESN'T SPECIFY- NOTIFICATION.

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:14.924
EXPECTATIONS THE MINISTRATION-

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:16.792
OUR THOUGHT PROCESS WAS THAT WE

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:17.927
WOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION IN

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:18.995
TERMS OF HOW FUNDING WAS

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:21.898
SHIFTED IN PROVIDED AND USE OF.

01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:23.866
THE FEDERAL FUNDING AUTHORITY.

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:25.968
PORTION OF THAT YOU ARE A

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:27.136
REGULAR FISCAL UPDATES AND

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:28.671
BRIEFINGS PROCESSES THAT WE'VE

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:29.872
DONE WE ANTICIPATE TO CONTINUE

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:31.707
DOING THOSE THINGS AND SO

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:32.708
THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT WE

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:35.178
WOULD ANTICIPATE TO CONTINUE

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:37.580
USING TO SHARE THE INFORMATION.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:40.383
SO IN TERMS OF WHY ARE YOU

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:41.517
ASKING FOR THIS BROADER THE

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.619
AUTHORITY. WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:45.054
NOTIFICATION YOU THINK THAT

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:47.023
THEIR REPORTS EVERY COUPLE OF

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:49.825
MONTHS WOULD COVER THAT. I

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:51.260
MENTIONED EARLIER TYPICALLY

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:52.161
WHEN WE'RE DOING ANY SORT OF

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:54.430
NEW ACTIVITY WE HAVE BRIEFINGS

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.799
AND HOLD DISCUSSIONS WITH

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:59.068
MEMBERS AND STAFF PRIOR TO

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:01.904
LAUNCHING THOSE ACTIVITIES-

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:02.838
RIGHT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:03.873
THINK THAT ACTIVITY ON THAT

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.474
LEVEL OF CONGESTION

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:08.711
NOTIFICATION INVOLVEMENT. MADAM

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:11.714
CHAIR IF I IF I GET A YES MR

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:13.916
SODERBERGH. ON WE THINK THAT

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:15.084
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE AN

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:17.086
EXPLICIT NOTIFICATION

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:19.789
REQUIREMENT- DIDN'T TO MAKE

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:20.957
NOTIFICATION EXPLICITLY

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:22.725
REQUIRED BECAUSE THAT ENSURES

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.227
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL GET

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:27.029
THE INFORMATION. IT FINDS TO BE

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:30.433
NECESSARY IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE

01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:31.601
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:34.270
OFTEN EXCEEDED- THE LEGAL

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:35.705
REQUIREMENTS ON THE LEVEL OF

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:37.540
INFORMATION PROVIDED BUT WE

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:39.575
THINK THAT- THERE'S NO HARM IN

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:41.077
REQUIRING THE INFORMATION BE

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:42.478
PROVIDED AND WE THINK IT'S

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.280
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. THAT

RELATED TO LARGE FEDERAL FUNDS

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:49.385
AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK THE

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:51.420
CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:53.155
PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES THAT

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:54.790
NOTIFICATION- WOULD BE

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:57.226
PREFERABLE TO THE- ELEVEN NINE

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:59.662

ON THIS EARLY SO THE FIRST IS

THAT EITHER ELEVEN NINETY ONE

SHOULD REPLICATE THE

KNOW PUTTING THIS TOGETHER IN

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:43.005
DECEMBER- YOU KNOW ALL THROUGH

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:45.041
THIS PANDEMIC YOU KNOW I THINK

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.809
WE'VE HEARD POLICYMAKERS SAY

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:49.078
YOU KNOW THE LAST MONTH OR TWO

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.814
MONTHS AGO WAS- LIKE A

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:54.350
DIFFERENT WORLD BUT WE WERE IN

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:57.019
A DIFFERENT WORLD- IN IN. A

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:58.721
THINK OF. WHERE WE WERE IN

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:02.391
DECEMBER. IN WHERE WE ARE NOW

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:04.193
IT IS REMARKABLY DIFFERENT IN A

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:08.097

YOU KNOW SOME ROLL UP USED TO

BE DONE IMMEDIATELY- I THINK

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:19.575
THAT'S A GOOD WAY WHICH THE

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.677
QUESTION BECOMES HOW ABOUT THE

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:23.879
SOME. THINGS THAT DON'T NEED TO

01:06:23.946 --> 01:06:25.981
BE ROLLED OUT IMMEDIATELY BUT

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:28.484
ARE PART OF- ALONG A LONGER

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:32.855
GAME. SO TO SPEAK NO THIS IS A

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:35.291
GAME BUT A LONGER. APPROACH A

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:37.660
LONGER RANGE APPROACH THAT

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.662
WOULD BE STEEPED IN POLICY THE

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:41.497

BUT I WOULDN'T CALL IT

01:07:10.493 --> 01:07:13.229
INTERMEDIACY OF THAT TO THAT

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:17.066
APPROACH. CONVERSELY IF YOU

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:51.033
HAS A MUCH GREATER URGENCY BUT

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.735
ALL OF ALL THAT SPEAKS TO THE

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:55.004

EMERGENCIES THAT AREN'T NEEDED

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:55.544
ON A PRICING BASIS AND IN THOSE

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:57.312

OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT'S-

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:33.182
WHY SOME OF THE ONES CREATED

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:03.198
CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:05.500
APPROPRIATE NOT ONLY FOR COVERT

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:06.835
NINETEEN BUT REALLY FALL FUTURE

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:16.278
APPLY TO ALL STATE EMERGENCIES

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:17.913
AND REALLY PROVIDE VERY LITTLE

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.915
ROLE FOR LEGISLATIVE. OVERSIGHT

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:21.716
SO TO ADDRESS THAT BOTH THE

01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:23.552
THAT PROBLEM BOTH AS IT APPLIES

01:20:23.618 --> 01:20:25.420
TO COPE WITH NINETEEN AND OTHER

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:27.455
STATE EMERGENCIES. WE RECOMMEND

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:30.625
A SERIES OF STATUTORY CHANGES-

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.594
TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.129
GREATER OVERSIGHT EMERGENCY

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:37.032
SPENDING- FIRST WE'D RECOMMEND

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:38.400
REQUIRING ALL EMERGENCY

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:40.936
AUGMENTATIONS COME FROM THREE-

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:42.103
THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:44.306
AUGMENTATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:46.474
SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS- WE KNOW

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.443
THAT WE WOULD STILL. UNDER OUR

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.111
RECOMMENDATION ALLOW THE

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:51.246
ADMINISTRATION TO USE ITS

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:52.747
POWERS UNDER C. SAID TO

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:54.416
REDIRECT FUNDS BUT IN ORDER TO

01:20:54.482 --> 01:20:55.217
MAKE THOSE AVAILABLE

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:56.685
DEPARTMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:58.553
WE NEED TO DO A HOT DEPOSITED

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.456
THREE OFFERS. AS MR BENTSEN

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.291
DESCRIBED EARLIER THIS IS

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:04.392
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY'RE

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:07.128
ALREADY DOING- THIS WOULD SORT

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:09.664
OF ENSURE THAT THE- ALLOCATIONS

01:21:09.731 --> 01:21:11.166
PROVIDED TO DEPARTMENTS LIKE I

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:14.803
SAID ARE. SUBJECT TO ALL THE

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:15.437
SAME REQUIREMENTS. THIS CHANGE

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:16.504
WITH RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:21:16.571 --> 01:21:18.106
LEGISLATURE AT THE BEGINNING OF

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:19.808
THE YEAR ESTABLISH AN AMOUNT

01:21:19.874 --> 01:21:21.743
FOR DARIO AND THE BUDGET. THIS

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.111
WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:24.946
INPUT INTO THE LEVEL OF FUNDING

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:26.414
AVAILABLE FOR EMERGENCY

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:28.216
EXPENDITURES. IT WOULD ALSO

01:21:28.283 --> 01:21:29.718
MINIMIZE THE CHANCE THAT

01:21:29.784 --> 01:21:31.686
EMERGENCY SPINE- SPENDING ENDS

01:21:31.753 --> 01:21:34.322
UP UNDERMINING. THE STATE

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:35.957
BUDGET STRUCTURE OR CONDITION

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:37.726
FROM OR TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S

01:21:37.792 --> 01:21:40.362
NECESSARY THAT'S THAT SPENDING-

01:21:40.428 --> 01:21:41.796
DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE BUDGT

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:44.432
THE LEGISLATURE IS- INVOLVED AT

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:45.867
THE FRONT ABOUT THE AMOUNT

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:47.402
AVAILABLE FOR EMERGENCY

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:49.437
SPENDING. THE THIRD CHANGE WE'D

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:50.905
RECOMMEND IS REQUIRING ADVANCE

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:52.941
NOTIFICATION TO TRANSFER FUNDS

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:55.944
INTO TRIO- SEVEN SOME YEARS OF

01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:58.113
THE ADMINISTRATION MAY NEED TO

01:21:58.179 --> 01:21:59.581
EXCEED THE AMOUNT BUDGETED

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.650
INJURY- AND TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:03.251
LEGISLATURE AS PART OF THIS

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.387
DECISION WE- DEMAND THAT START

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:07.455
TO BE CHANGED TO. REQUIRE THE

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:08.757
ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.825
ADVANCE NOTIFICATION TO JAIL

01:22:10.892 --> 01:22:12.927
BC. THEN THE NOTIFICATIONS

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:15.030
WOULD. BE A DIFFERENT TYPES

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:17.899
DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION- FOR

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:19.301
EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:20.702
ESTABLISH A SHORTER

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.704
NOTIFICATION PERIOD FOR SMALLER

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.272
TRANSFERS THAT ARE TIED TO

01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:25.874
ONGOING EMERGENCIES. FOR

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.976
EXAMPLE THIS COULD BE A SEVENTY

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:29.978
TWO HOUR NOTIFICATION- THIS

01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:31.379
WOULD BE REASONABLE SINCE THE

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:32.614
AMOUNTS WOULD BE SMALL THE

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:34.516
EMERGENCY WOULD BE ONGOING AND

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:35.650
THEREFORE VERY LIKELY TO BE

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.052
URGENT. AND WOULD BE

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:42.257
ACCOMPANIED BY SPECIFIC DETAILS.

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:42.824
ON HOW THE DOLLARS WOULD BE

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:44.759
SPENT. FROM WE WOULD RECKON IS

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:46.895
DOUBLE A- NO. PERIOD FOR LARGER

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:48.530
TRANSFERS OR TRANSFERS THAT ARE

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:49.798
MADE PROACTIVELY BEFORE

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:53.301
EMERGENCIES- THIS GETS BACK TO-

01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:54.436
THE QUESTION THAT SENATOR

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:56.371
CORTESE ASKED AS TO WHETHER

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:57.105
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:59.240
FUNDING THAT'S URGENT AND SOME

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:01.976
FUNDING THAT. LAST SURGEON THIS

01:23:02.043 --> 01:23:03.611
WOULD FALL INTO THE LESS URGENT

01:23:03.678 --> 01:23:05.947
CATEGORY- AND BECAUSE OF THAT

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:07.582
WE RECOMMEND THAT THERE BE A

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:08.683
THIRTY OR FORTY FIVE DAY

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:10.352
NOTIFICATION PROCESS TO ALLOW

01:23:10.418 --> 01:23:11.886
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONDUCT MORE

01:23:11.953 --> 01:23:13.054
OVERSIGHT FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:15.256
LEGISLATURE COULD BE CONVENE. A

01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:16.624
BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING TO

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:20.028
WEIGH WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS AN

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:20.962
APPROPRIATE THING TO DO-

01:23:21.029 --> 01:23:22.897
HOWEVER IN ALL CASES WE DO.

01:23:22.964 --> 01:23:25.400
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:27.102
ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:29.270
REQUEST A WAIVER OF THE

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:31.773
NOTIFICATION TIME FRAME- IF

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.808
URGENT CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE-

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:35.343
SUCH AS IF THERE IS A NEED TO

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:37.278
SPEND. FUNDS IN ORDER TO

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:38.713
PREVENT THE LOSS OF LIFE OR

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.783
DAMAGE TO PROPERTY- UNDER THESE

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:44.152
CASES OF JAIL B. C. APPROVED

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:46.454
THE WAIVER THE FUNDS WOULD BE

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:47.989
EITHER TRANSFERRED IMMEDIATELY.

01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:49.624
OR UNDER WHATEVER SHORTEN TIME

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:53.328
FRAME WAS SPECIFIED BY JAIL BC.

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:55.096
ANOTHER CHANGE WE RECOMMEND IS

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:57.532
THAT- THERE BE INCREASED

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:59.667
REPORTING ON DRIEL ALLOCATIONS

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:01.736
AND EXPENDITURES- IT'S

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:03.772
IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS WE HAVE

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.373
SAID A COUPLE TIMES IN TODAY'S

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.308
HEARINGS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:10.245
ABSOLUTELY EXCEEDED. THE LEVEL

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:11.579
OF INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:14.349
BY STATUTE THROUGHOUT COULD

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:15.583
NINETEEN NONETHELESS WE STILL

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:16.618
THINK THAT THE OVERALL AMOUNT

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:17.619
OF INFORMATION THAT THE

01:24:17.685 --> 01:24:19.454
LEGISLATURE IS PROVIDED IS

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:21.890
INADEQUATE FOR A CHAT- TO.

01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:23.658
UNDERTAKE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OF

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:26.961
THE NINETEEN EXPENDITURES. SO

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:29.431
WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS THAT THE

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:31.399
LEGISLATURE BE NOTIFIED WHEN

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:33.168
ALLOCATIONS ARE MADE FROM THREE

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:36.037
OO TO DEPARTMENTS- THIS WOULD

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:37.372
BE DONE AT THE TIME THE

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:38.873
ALLOCATION IS MADE AND THEN

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:41.075
THIS WOULD BE- THE NOTIFICATION

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.177
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:43.878
SPECIFIC INFORMATION LIKE THE

01:24:43.945 --> 01:24:45.346
AMOUNT BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE

01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:48.817
DEPARTMENT. AND THE SPECIFIC

01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:49.651
USES IT WOULD BE USED FOR. WE

01:24:49.717 --> 01:24:50.952
ALSO RECOMMEND EXPLICITLY

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:52.554
REQUIRING IN STATUTE THAT

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:55.457
MONTHLY REPORTS BE GENERATED BY

01:24:55.523 --> 01:24:56.958
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND

01:24:57.025 --> 01:24:58.893
ALL PLANNED AN ACTUAL SPENDING.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.595
THIS WOULD APPLY TO ALL

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:02.564
EMERGENCIES. AND WHAT OUTLINED

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:03.731
THE EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:05.633
ALLOCATED FROM REAL WORLD

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.469
FEDERAL FUNDS PRIVATE FUNDS AS

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:09.237
WELL AS EXPENDITURES OF FUNDS

01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:11.372
BUDGETED FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:13.475
FOR FUNDS THAT ARE REDIRECTED

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:17.011
UNDER C. SO AT THE READY- IN IT

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:18.980
IN ADDITION TO JUST DESCRIBING.

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:20.381
THE AMOUNTS OF FUNDS WE ALSO

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:22.217
RECOMMEND THAT THIS REPORT

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:25.520
INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:26.488
SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES FUNDED. SO

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.289
IF ALL OF THE SAFEGUARDS THAT I

01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:30.525
MENTIONED WERE PUT IN PLACE- WE

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:31.626
THINK THAT IT COULD BE

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:33.728
APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.029
TO EXPAND THE USE OF THREE-

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:38.099
UPPER CODE NINETEEN THROUGH THE

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:40.768
END OF THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR-

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:41.903
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE WELL

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:44.005
POSITIONED TO. EXECUTE

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.907
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THAT

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:48.676
CODE NINETEEN RESPONSE. HOWEVER

01:25:48.743 --> 01:25:49.677
WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:51.446
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT GREATER

01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:53.181
INVOLVEMENT GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE

01:25:53.248 --> 01:25:55.250
OF THE CODE NINETEEN SPENDING.

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:57.318
IN THIS CASE THE LEGISLATURE

01:25:57.385 --> 01:25:58.520
COULD CONSIDER INSTEAD

01:25:58.586 --> 01:26:00.622
REJECTING CONTROL SECTION

01:26:00.688 --> 01:26:01.656
ELEVEN POINT NINE TWO AND

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:03.358
CREATING A DIFFERENT BUDGET

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:04.859
CONTROL SECTION PROCESS. TO

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:06.661
ALLOCATE CODE NINETEEN FUNDS

01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:07.729
WOULD BE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT

01:26:07.795 --> 01:26:09.531
WAS DONE THROUGH CONTROL

01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:11.599
SECTION THIRTY SIX. IN THIS

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.067
CASE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:14.302
SPECIFY THE TOTAL AMOUNT

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:16.204
AVAILABLE. AND OUTLINED THE

01:26:16.271 --> 01:26:17.539
PROCESS TO NOTIFY THE

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:19.440
LEGISLATURE SUCH AS THROUGH

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:21.442
NOTIFICATIONS PROVIDED TO THE

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:22.210
JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:25.380
COMMITTEE- AND IN THIS CASE.

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:29.584
THE THE TOTAL AMOUNT AVAILABLE

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:31.352
FOR CODE SPENDING COULD ONLY BE

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:32.453
CHANGED IF THERE WAS AN

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.255
AMENDMENT TO THE BUDGET ACT AND

01:26:34.322 --> 01:26:36.124
SO THAT WOULD PUT CONSIDERABLY.

01:26:36.190 --> 01:26:37.992
MORE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:40.929
THE TWELVE MONTHS SPENT ON

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:41.563
CORPORATE NINETEEN. WITH THAT

01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:42.697
I'M HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:44.532
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THOSE

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:46.801
RECOMMENDATIONS. WE APPRECIATE

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:49.504
THE WORK THAT WENT ON THE FACT

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:51.573
THAT WENT BEHIND THAT- DOES THE

01:26:51.639 --> 01:26:53.641
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANT TO

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:56.077
RESPOND OR HAVE ANY COMMENTS.

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:58.046
ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:26:58.112 --> 01:26:59.614
MISTER BENSON. THANK YOU MADAM

01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:00.982
CHAIR APPRECIATE THAT NOW YOU

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:03.017
JUST VERY BRIEFLY. YEAH SO LIKE

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:04.719
AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE'RE

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:06.554
STILL REVIEWING THE REPORT AND

I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE

01:47:22.302 --> 01:47:25.205
MOST SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS FIRST

01:47:25.272 --> 01:47:26.840
WARDEN'S REMAINS CENTRAL TO

01:47:26.907 --> 01:47:28.775
THIS PROCESS AND UNDERMINE THE

01:47:28.842 --> 01:47:30.544
PURPOSE OF AIMS BY NOT

01:47:30.610 --> 01:47:33.180
REFERRING CASES AND KEEPING

01:47:33.246 --> 01:47:35.882
INCREASE WITHIN THE INSTITUTION.

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:37.484
TO THE DEPARTMENT HAS LIKELY

01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:39.019
GROSSLY UNDERCOUNTED THE ACTUAL

01:47:39.085 --> 01:47:40.654
NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:43.223
MISCONDUCT. BY ALLOWING WARDENS

01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:44.391
TO SIMPLY RE CATEGORIZE

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:45.759
COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGATIONS OF

01:47:45.826 --> 01:47:47.060
STAFF MISCONDUCT TO ROUTINE

01:47:47.127 --> 01:47:50.764
GRIEVANCES. AND FINALLY WARDENS

01:47:50.831 --> 01:47:52.432
RARELY FOUND MERIT IN THE

01:47:52.499 --> 01:47:54.568
ALLEGATIONS THEY RESOLVED

01:47:54.634 --> 01:47:55.335
ESSENTIALLY EXONERATING THEIR

01:47:55.402 --> 01:47:57.537
STAFF. MORE THAN 98% OF THE

01:47:57.604 --> 01:48:01.741
TIME. WE REVIEW THE ACTIVITIES

01:48:01.808 --> 01:48:03.476
OF AIMS FOR A FIVE MONTH PERIOD

01:48:03.543 --> 01:48:05.879
STARTING APRIL FIRST TWENTY

01:48:05.946 --> 01:48:06.880
TWENTY THROUGH AUGUST THIRTY

01:48:06.947 --> 01:48:09.382
FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. I WANT TO

01:48:09.449 --> 01:48:10.483
EMPHASIZE THAT THIS WAS A

01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:12.452
PERIOD WHEN AIMS WAS FULLY

01:48:12.519 --> 01:48:15.222
FUNCTIONAL. DURING THIS FIVE

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:17.390
MONTH PERIOD THE UNIT ACCEPTED

01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:18.458
FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:20.961
INCREASE OR ABOUT ONE FIFTH. OF

01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:27.000
WHAT. WHAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:29.069
PROPOSED IT WOULD HANDLE. WE

01:48:29.135 --> 01:48:30.770
FOUND THAT WARDENS DETERMINED

01:48:30.837 --> 01:48:33.640
DURING THIS PERIOD THAT TWO

01:48:33.707 --> 01:48:34.274
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND

01:48:34.341 --> 01:48:35.542
THIRTY NINE GRIEVANCES ALLEGED

01:48:35.609 --> 01:48:37.777
STAFF MISCONDUCT BUT WARDEN'S

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:40.013
ONLY REFERRED FIVE HUNDRED AND

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.582
FORTY ONE OF THESE TO AIMS.

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:43.450
HOWEVER ACCORDING TO THE

01:48:43.516 --> 01:48:44.818
DEPARTMENT'S OWN ANALYSIS WHEN

01:48:44.885 --> 01:48:46.419
REQUESTING THE BUDGET

01:48:46.486 --> 01:48:48.154
AUGMENTATION FOR AIMS. THAT

01:48:48.221 --> 01:48:50.223
APART THE UNIT COULD HAVE

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:50.657
HANDLED ALL OF THESE

01:48:50.724 --> 01:48:53.026
ALLEGATIONS. IF AIMS HAD

01:48:53.093 --> 01:48:54.561
FULFILLED ITS PROMISE IN THE

01:48:54.628 --> 01:48:55.695
NUMBER OF INCREASE THAT WOULD

01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:58.064
HANDLE THE ANNUALIZED COST PER

01:48:58.131 --> 01:49:01.768
ENQUIRY WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY

01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:02.302
ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED

01:49:02.369 --> 01:49:03.503
FIFTY DOLLARS. BASED ON THE

01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:05.372
WORK THEY ACTUALLY DID THE

01:49:05.438 --> 01:49:06.840
ANNUALIZED COST PER ENQUIRY IS

01:49:06.907 --> 01:49:09.309
APPROXIMATELY NINE THOUSAND

01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:09.843
FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE

01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:13.446
DOLLARS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE

01:49:13.513 --> 01:49:15.148
WAY THE INCREASES ARE CONDUCTED

01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:18.084
IS FLAWED. AIMS INVESTIGATORS

01:49:18.151 --> 01:49:19.819
DO NOT PERFORM A COMPLETE AND

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:23.089
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION INSTEAD

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:24.591
THEY WORK TO A NEBULOUS

01:49:24.658 --> 01:49:26.293
REASONABLE BELIEF STANDARD.

01:49:26.359 --> 01:49:28.194
THAT IS A REASONABLE BELIEF

01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:28.695
THAT MISCONDUCT MAY HAVE

01:49:28.762 --> 01:49:31.298
OCCURRED. AND THEN STOP THEIR

01:49:31.364 --> 01:49:33.333
INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES WRITE

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:34.734
A REPORT AND SUBMIT THE REPORT

01:49:34.801 --> 01:49:37.437
TO THE WARDEN. IF THE WARDEN

01:49:37.504 --> 01:49:39.272
DISAGREES WITH THE CONCLUSION

01:49:39.339 --> 01:49:39.773
BY THE INVESTIGATOR THE

01:49:39.839 --> 01:49:44.611
ENQUIRIES OVER. IN TWO THOUSAND

01:49:44.678 --> 01:49:45.111
NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT

01:49:45.178 --> 01:49:46.579
INFORMED THE LEGISLATURE THAT

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:47.781
THE WARDENS AND THE

01:49:47.847 --> 01:49:49.516
INSTITUTIONAL STAFF WERE

01:49:49.582 --> 01:49:51.751
REMOVED FROM THIS PROCESS.

01:49:51.818 --> 01:49:52.886
HOEVER UNDER THE DEPARTMENT'S

01:49:52.953 --> 01:49:54.654
REGULATIONS DEVELOPED AS A

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:56.423
RESULT OF OUR TWO THOUSAND

01:49:56.489 --> 01:49:57.724
NINETEEN REPORT WARDENS AND

01:49:57.791 --> 01:49:59.993
INSTITUTIONAL STAFF REMAINED

01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:02.262
CENTRAL TO THIS PROCESS.

01:50:02.329 --> 01:50:04.297
CURRENTLY WARDENS OR THEIR

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:06.700
CHIEFS REVIEW EVERY CLAIM THAT

01:50:06.766 --> 01:50:08.201
POTENTIALLY CONTAINS A

01:50:08.268 --> 01:50:10.270
GRIEVANCE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF

01:50:10.337 --> 01:50:12.305
MISCONDUCT. AND DETERMINE

01:50:12.372 --> 01:50:13.340
WHETHER THE CLAIM MEETS THE

01:50:13.406 --> 01:50:14.674
DEPARTMENT'S DEFINITION OF

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:16.910
STAFF MISCONDUCT AND WHETHER IT

01:50:16.977 --> 01:50:17.477
WILL BE REFERRED OUTSIDE THE

01:50:17.544 --> 01:50:20.480

01:50:20.547 --> 01:50:22.048
TO AIMS FOR INQUIRY WITHOUT THE

01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:24.017
WARDEN MAKING A REFERRAL.

01:50:24.084 --> 01:50:25.385
CONTRARY TO WHAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:27.053
ASSERTED IN AN ASSEMBLY HEARING

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.222
ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO. WARDENS

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:30.890
AND INSTITUTIONAL STAFF ARE

01:50:30.957 --> 01:50:32.625
MOST ASSUREDLY NOT OUT OF THIS

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:36.696
PROCESS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE

01:50:36.763 --> 01:50:37.797
CRITERIA THE DEPARTMENT

01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:38.832
DEVELOPED FOR REFERRING

01:50:38.898 --> 01:50:40.767
GRIEVANCES TO AIMS FOR THE

01:50:40.834 --> 01:50:42.902
COMPLEX CALCULUS THAT WORKS TO

01:50:42.969 --> 01:50:44.971
EXCLUDE MOST BECAUSE MOST

01:50:45.038 --> 01:50:47.340
CLAIMS OF MISCONDUCT FROM BEING

01:50:47.407 --> 01:50:51.444
INVESTIGATED BY AIMS. EXCLUDE

01:50:51.511 --> 01:50:53.480
COMPLAINS THAT ALLEGED.

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:54.714
SERRATED PERSON'S CLAIM OF

FORCE REPORTED BY STAFF BUT

01:50:58.318 --> 01:50:59.886
THAT DID NOT RESULT IN SERIOUS

01:50:59.953 --> 01:51:02.222
BODILY INJURY. SEXUAL

01:51:02.288 --> 01:51:04.124
MISCONDUCT OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT

HOWEVER THEY ONLY REFERRED 23%

01:51:48.501 --> 01:51:50.603

DEPARTMENT'S RECORDS SHOW.

01:52:15.695 --> 01:52:16.830
UNDER THE PROCESS DEVELOPED BY

01:52:16.896 --> 01:52:18.698
THE DEPARTMENT A GRIEVANCE IS

01:52:18.765 --> 01:52:20.633
FIRST REVIEWED BY A GRIEVANCE

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:22.635
COORDINATOR WHO REFUSE TO SEE

01:52:22.702 --> 01:52:23.736
IF THERE'S AN ALLEGATION OF

01:52:23.803 --> 01:52:25.839
STAFF MISCONDUCT. AFTER THAT

01:52:25.905 --> 01:52:28.007
REVIEW THE GRIEVANCE GOES FOR A

01:52:28.074 --> 01:52:30.076
FINAL REVIEW TO THE WARDEN TO

NOT TO BE STAFF MISCONDUCT

01:52:49.662 --> 01:52:51.064
CLAIMS WERE SIMPLY RE

01:52:51.131 --> 01:52:52.398
CATEGORIZED BY THE WARDEN AS A

01:52:52.465 --> 01:52:56.536
ROUTINE GRIEVANCE. NEXT A FULL

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:57.804
TWO YEARS AFTER SURE INCE'S

01:52:57.871 --> 01:52:59.906
WERE GIVEN NO AUDIT FUNCTION IS

01:52:59.973 --> 01:53:01.708
ANYWHERE IN SIGHT. THE

01:53:01.774 --> 01:53:03.409
DEPARTMENT HAS NO VISIBILITY ON

01:53:03.476 --> 01:53:05.078
WHETHER THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS

01:53:05.145 --> 01:53:06.946
IS WORKING. THE DEPARTMENT HAS

01:53:07.013 --> 01:53:08.915
NO SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS ITSELF TO

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:11.384
PRODUCE REPORTS IDENTIFYING ALL

01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:12.018
OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED

01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:14.521

01:53:14.587 --> 01:53:16.923
THOSE ACCUSATIONS CORROBORATED

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:19.159
OR WHO HAVE BEEN PUNISHED.

01:53:19.225 --> 01:53:21.227
FINALLY JUST AS AT SALINAS

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:23.096
VALLEY TWO YEARS AGO THIS

01:53:23.163 --> 01:53:25.131
PROCESS EXONERATE STAFF AT AN

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:27.600
ASTONISHING RATE. STAFF WERE

01:53:27.667 --> 01:53:29.369
EXONERATED NINETY EIGHT POINT

01:53:29.435 --> 01:53:31.204
3% OF THE TIME IN THE CASES

01:53:31.271 --> 01:53:33.640
LOOKED AT EITHER BY AIMS OR

01:53:33.706 --> 01:53:34.240
THOSE HANDLED IN HOUSE AT THE

01:53:34.307 --> 01:53:36.543
PRISONS. IN FACT UNDER THIS

01:53:36.609 --> 01:53:37.710
PROCESS THE RATE OF

01:53:37.777 --> 01:53:40.146
EXONERATIONS EXCEEDS WHAT WE

01:53:40.213 --> 01:53:40.713
FOUND AT SALINAS VALLEY TWO

01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:43.917
YEARS AGO. THE ISSUES ARE

01:53:43.983 --> 01:53:45.885
RAISED ABOVE ARE SYSTEMIC AND

01:53:45.952 --> 01:53:46.786
NOT ISOLATED TO A PARTICULAR

01:53:46.853 --> 01:53:48.755
PRISON. THE SHORTCOMINGS ARE

01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:50.290
ENSHRINED IN REGULATIONS THAT

01:53:50.356 --> 01:53:51.391
THE DEPARTMENT PROMULGATED

01:53:51.457 --> 01:53:54.093
ALMOST A YEAR AGO. TO CORRECT

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.428
THESE DEFICIENCIES I BELIEVE

01:53:55.495 --> 01:53:56.963
THE DEPARTMENT MUST COMPLETELY

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:59.566
OVERHAUL ITS PROCESS. IN MY

01:53:59.632 --> 01:54:01.100
OPINION THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD

01:54:01.167 --> 01:54:02.936
TAKE A CLEAN SHEET APPROACH TO

01:54:03.002 --> 01:54:05.338
REVAMP THIS PROCESS. EMPHASIS

01:54:05.405 --> 01:54:07.473
NEEDS TO BE ILL BE ON ALLOWING

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:08.942
AGGRIEVED PERSONS TO FORWARD

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:10.577
THEIR COMPLAINTS DIRECTLY TO

01:54:10.643 --> 01:54:12.745
THE AIMS UNIT. AND THE AIMS

01:54:12.812 --> 01:54:13.880
UNIT SHOULD CONDUCT ALL

01:54:13.947 --> 01:54:15.882
ENQUIRIES NO MISCONDUCT

01:54:15.949 --> 01:54:17.784
INCREASE SHOULD BE RETURNED TO

01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:19.986
THE INSTITUTION. IN THE CASE OF

01:54:20.053 --> 01:54:21.087
USE OF FORCE MISCONDUCT

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:22.222
COMPLAINTS THERE SHOULD BE NO

01:54:22.288 --> 01:54:23.723
ARTIFICIAL DIFFERENTIATION

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:25.358
BETWEEN MISCONDUCT THAT CAUSES

01:54:25.425 --> 01:54:27.594
PHYSICAL INJURY AND MISCONDUCT

01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:29.529
THAT BY A STROKE OF LUCK DIDN'T

01:54:29.596 --> 01:54:31.664
CAUSE PHYSICAL INJURY. THERE

01:54:31.731 --> 01:54:32.765
SHOULD BE NO ARTIFICIAL

01:54:32.832 --> 01:54:33.866
DIFFERENTIATION OF SEXUAL

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:36.636
MISCONDUCT GRIEVANCES. THE AMES

01:54:36.703 --> 01:54:37.604
UNIT NEEDS TO INCREASE THE

01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:39.105
NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS IT OPENS

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:40.974
AND IT NEEDS TO DO MORE

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:44.177
THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS.

01:54:44.244 --> 01:54:45.511
INSTEAD OF WHAT WAS PROMISED

01:54:45.578 --> 01:54:46.646
TWO YEARS AGO THE DEPARTMENT

01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:48.615
DESIGNED A SYSTEM WITH MANY OFF

01:54:48.681 --> 01:54:50.350
RAMPS THAT PREVENT A FAIR AND

01:54:50.416 --> 01:54:51.951
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF

01:54:52.018 --> 01:54:53.920

SYSTEMS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO

01:56:48.167 --> 01:56:50.136
MY HEART WHEN I WAS THE

01:56:50.203 --> 01:56:51.104
DIRECTOR OF THE ADULT

01:56:51.170 --> 01:56:54.941
INSTITUTIONS AND TRAVERSES

01:56:55.007 --> 01:57:00.046
REALIZE THAT THEY'RE. TOO DARK-

01:57:00.113 --> 01:57:02.615
I KNEW FROM MY MANY YEARS OF

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:06.185
EXPERIENCE WELL OVER THIRTY- IF

01:57:06.252 --> 01:57:08.654
THIS BUSINESS THAT. THERE OR

01:57:08.721 --> 01:57:10.456
THERE WAS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN

01:57:10.523 --> 01:57:13.393
OUR STAFF ALLEGATIONS- PROCESS

01:57:13.459 --> 01:57:16.129
AT FIRST SAYS ARE- INTERNAL

01:57:16.195 --> 01:57:18.798
AFFAIRS WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS

01:57:18.865 --> 01:57:22.101
WE HAVE NUMEROUS INMATES- STAFF

01:57:22.168 --> 01:57:25.805
COMPLAINTS. MOST AS AS THE

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:27.507
OPTION INSPECTOR GENERAL STATED

AVERAGE OF TWO THOUSAND CASES

01:57:34.781 --> 01:57:36.382
ANNUALLY THAT ARE REFERRED FOR

01:57:36.449 --> 01:57:37.984
INVESTIGATION SO THERE'S A

01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:40.386
DISCONNECT SOMEWHERE. AND ALL

01:57:40.453 --> 01:57:43.556
OF THAT OVER TWO THOUSAND-

01:57:43.623 --> 01:57:45.324
REFERRALS TO OFFICE OF INTERNAL

01:57:45.391 --> 01:57:48.995
AFFAIRS ANYWHERE FROM TWELVE TO

01:57:49.061 --> 01:57:49.495
FIFTEEN HUNDRED OF THOSE

01:57:49.562 --> 01:57:51.597
RESULTS IN FORMAL- ADVERSE

01:57:51.664 --> 01:57:54.066
ACTION ON OUR STAFF. SO THERE

01:57:54.133 --> 01:57:55.468
WAS THERE WAS A DISCONNECTED

01:57:55.535 --> 01:57:57.870
THE DEPARTMENT WENT THROUGH I'M

01:57:57.937 --> 01:58:00.072
AND DEVELOPED A PROCESS THAT

01:58:00.139 --> 01:58:02.809
WAS IMPLEMENTED IN JANUARY OF

01:58:02.875 --> 01:58:04.544
TWENTY TWENTY. INITIALLY AND

01:58:04.610 --> 01:58:06.879
THEN FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN

01:58:06.946 --> 01:58:10.016
APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY IN THE

01:58:10.082 --> 01:58:15.688
THROES OF COKE. THEREFORE IT.

01:58:15.755 --> 01:58:16.823
EIGHT AND I ALSO HAVE TO SAY

01:58:16.889 --> 01:58:18.224
THIS THAT I ALSO THINK THAT WE

01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:19.892
MADE IT TOO COMPLEX THE PROCESS

01:58:19.959 --> 01:58:22.261
WAS VERY VERY COMPLEX AS AS

01:58:22.328 --> 01:58:26.399
THE- IG REPORT HIGHLIGHTS- WITH

01:58:26.466 --> 01:58:30.336
A VARIETY OF CONCERNS. AND SO

01:58:30.403 --> 01:58:32.004
I'M HERE TO COMMIT TODAY TO

01:58:32.071 --> 01:58:35.508
MAKE YOU VERY SPECIFIC CHANGES.

01:58:35.575 --> 01:58:38.244
TO THIS PROCESS- AND REALLY

01:58:38.311 --> 01:58:45.918
LOOKING FORWARD- TO HAVE IN A

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:48.287
SEAMLESS PROCESS THAT WORKS FOR

01:58:48.354 --> 01:58:51.390
EVERYBODY I JUST. IT'S VERY

01:58:51.457 --> 01:58:56.796
TROUBLING- ANYWAY I APOLOGIZE

01:58:56.863 --> 01:59:01.234
SO- THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE MADE

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:02.635
IT WE MADE IT TOO DIFFICULT FOR

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:05.171
THE INSTITUTIONS AND WE WERE

01:59:05.238 --> 01:59:06.372
ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:11.177
EVALUATING OUR- OUR- PROCESS

01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:13.980
EARLY EARLY ON. AND WE MERE

01:59:14.046 --> 01:59:15.648
SOMEWHAT WE CAME UP WITH SOME

01:59:15.715 --> 01:59:17.116
OF THE SAME SOLUTIONS OF THE- I

01:59:17.183 --> 01:59:19.151
CHEATED I WILL SAY THAT WE

01:59:19.218 --> 01:59:22.188
FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT WARDENS

01:59:22.255 --> 01:59:26.092
WERE NOT- PROPERLY REFERRED.

01:59:26.158 --> 01:59:27.927
WHAT W FOUND BECAUSE THAT IT

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:29.529
WAS THE DEFINITION ON HOW THEY

01:59:29.595 --> 01:59:30.830
GOT THERE AND EXCLUSIONARY

01:59:30.897 --> 01:59:32.965
CRITERIA WHICH WERE. SOME OF

01:59:33.032 --> 01:59:34.634
THE PRIMARY CONCERNS THAT WE

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:36.168
NEED TO FOCUS OUR ENERGY ON

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:39.972
GOING FORWARD. WE ALSO FOUND

01:59:40.039 --> 01:59:41.440
THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME FAR

01:59:41.507 --> 01:59:44.944
EXCEEDED THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES.

01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:46.812
SC'S CONCERT WE'RE CURRENTLY

01:59:46.879 --> 01:59:48.915
DOING NEXT TIME AND MOTION

01:59:48.981 --> 01:59:52.785
STUDY- THE FIGURE OUT EXACTLY

01:59:52.852 --> 01:59:54.987
HOW LONG IT TAKES AND SOME OF

01:59:55.054 --> 01:59:57.590
THE REASONS WHY I WILL SAY

01:59:57.657 --> 02:00:01.260
THAT- AS I READ THESE REPORTS

02:00:01.327 --> 02:00:02.795
FIRST IS WHAT I USED TO READ AT

02:00:02.862 --> 02:00:05.231
INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL WHEN A

02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:06.365
LIEUTENANT PROVIDING MERE

02:00:06.432 --> 02:00:09.769

INTERVIEWS BY LOTS OF. NOT ONLY

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:16.809

02:00:16.876 --> 02:00:20.780
WITNESSES OF OTHER OFFENDERS OR

02:00:20.846 --> 02:00:24.917
STAFF IS- PART OF THE PROCESS.

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:28.054
I WILL SAY IF YOU HAVE CAMERAS

02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:28.654
IT MAKES IT TOTALLY DIFFERENT

02:00:28.721 --> 02:00:32.325
REPORT. AMR'S REALLY HELP US TO

02:00:32.391 --> 02:00:35.695

IT WHETHER THE ALLEGATION IS

02:00:37.964 --> 02:00:42.401
TRUE OR NOT- SO I WILL SAY THAT.

02:00:42.468 --> 02:00:44.804
I'M SO SOME OF OUR VERY

02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:46.906
SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS FIRST TO

02:00:46.973 --> 02:00:49.408
THE INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OF

02:00:49.475 --> 02:00:50.242
THE SCREENING AT THE LOCAL

02:00:50.309 --> 02:00:53.145

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PREAH-

02:01:06.993 --> 02:01:08.327
WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE A VERY

02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:27.513
YOU ONLY HAVE SO. MUCH TRYING

02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:31.584
TO GET SOMEBODY TO- FOR THE

02:01:31.651 --> 02:01:33.719
FULL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION THAT

02:01:33.786 --> 02:01:35.721

CRITERIA- MOST OF THEM 77% AND

02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:41.400
THAT'S A NUMBER FROM ACROSS THE

02:10:41.466 --> 02:10:43.702
SPECTRUM WERE KEPT IN THE

ACCORDING TO THE REGULATIONS

DEVELOPED BY THE DEPARTMENT

THOUGH SHOULD HAVE BEEN

02:10:51.009 --> 02:10:55.547
REFERRED TO AIMS- SO IT WAS IT

02:10:55.614 --> 02:10:57.549
THIS WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:10:57.616 --> 02:11:00.686
JUST ISOLATED TO ONE PRISON- WE

02:11:00.752 --> 02:11:03.455
SAW THE SAME ISSUES- AT PRETTY

02:11:03.522 --> 02:11:08.527
MUCH EVERY PRISON- IN THE STATE.

02:11:08.594 --> 02:11:13.665
FROM ARE THERE ANY RESOURCES

02:11:13.732 --> 02:11:16.535
THAT YOUR OFFICE MAY NEED TO

02:11:16.602 --> 02:11:21.240

02:11:26.945 --> 02:11:30.282
OUR OFFICE IS. SERIOUSLY UNDER

02:11:30.349 --> 02:11:33.485
RESOURCE TO REVIEW THE NUMBER

02:11:33.552 --> 02:11:35.954
OF COMPLAINTS AND PROVIDE THE

02:11:36.021 --> 02:11:39.191
MONITORING- THAT WE THINK IS

02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:41.660
APPROPRIATE- WE HAVE FIVE

02:11:41.727 --> 02:11:43.962
PEOPLE STATE WIDE ONE OF THOSE

02:11:44.029 --> 02:11:46.865
AS A SUPERVISOR SO WE HAVE FOUR

02:11:46.932 --> 02:11:49.334
PEOPLE OUT IN THE FIELD WHO DO

02:11:49.401 --> 02:11:52.804
THIS KIND OF MONITORING- AND SO

02:11:52.871 --> 02:11:55.674
WE CAN DO NOTHING MORE THAN-

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:59.378
ANECDOTAL MONITORING OF THE- OF

02:11:59.444 --> 02:12:01.680
THE QUALITY OF THE OF THE

02:12:01.747 --> 02:12:06.251
INQUIRY'S- WE RECOMMEND THAT-

02:12:06.318 --> 02:12:07.653
AS IN OUR OTHER MONITORING

02:12:07.719 --> 02:12:09.054
ACTIVITIES THAT WE MONITOR

02:12:09.121 --> 02:12:11.823
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- 25%

02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:14.293
OR MORE OF. THE ENCOURAGED TO

02:12:14.359 --> 02:12:15.894
GO FORWARD WE THINK THAT GIVES

02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:18.096
A GOOD STATISTICAL MODEL TO

02:12:18.163 --> 02:12:22.434
DRAW CONCLUSIONS FROM- WHAT WE

02:12:22.501 --> 02:12:26.705
ARE- WHAT OUR FIRST REPORT HAS

02:12:26.772 --> 02:12:29.941
FOCUSED ON IS THE IS THE BONES

02:12:30.008 --> 02:12:31.977
OF THE PROCESS HOW IT'S SET UP

02:12:32.044 --> 02:12:33.945
AND HOW THAT'S WORKING WE HAVE

02:12:34.012 --> 02:12:36.448
NOT FOCUSED ON THE QUALITY OF

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:38.784
THE INTERVIEWS- SIMPLY BECAUSE

02:12:38.850 --> 02:12:39.818
WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE TO DO

02:12:39.885 --> 02:12:48.193
THAT- I'M I- HAVE- WE WORKED UP

02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:52.097
SOME. SOME NUMBERS- AND I'M

02:12:52.164 --> 02:12:54.166
HAPPY TO SHARE THOSE WITH YOU-

02:12:54.232 --> 02:12:57.069
BUT BUT BASED ON THE RESOURCES

02:12:57.135 --> 02:13:00.639
THAT WE HAVE- THERE IS THERE

02:13:00.706 --> 02:13:03.442
SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH MONITORS TO-

02:13:03.508 --> 02:13:05.610
ACTUALLY PROVIDE GOOD

02:13:05.677 --> 02:13:08.246
INFORMATION ON HOW THE PROCESS

02:13:08.313 --> 02:13:10.982
IS WORKING- IN A QUALITATIVE

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:13.518
SENSE OF ONE OTHER THING I'D

02:13:13.585 --> 02:13:16.688
LIKE TO CLARIFY- IN THAT IS THE

02:13:16.755 --> 02:13:20.258
PRE A PIECE I'D LIKE TO- SORT

02:13:20.325 --> 02:13:21.259
AMPLIFY ON WHAT THE SECRETARY

02:13:21.326 --> 02:13:23.662
NOTED- SHE NOTED THAT WE

02:13:23.729 --> 02:13:25.530
MONITOR PRIA THAT'S NOT

02:13:25.597 --> 02:13:30.836
PRECISELY TRUE- OUR- OUR

02:13:30.902 --> 02:13:32.938
STATUTE. REQUIRES A HER NAME'S

02:13:33.004 --> 02:13:36.475
US AS THE PRE OP OMBUDSMAN- AND

02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:39.511
SO THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT IS

02:13:39.578 --> 02:13:41.747
THAT WOULD YOU HAVE SOMEBODY

02:13:41.813 --> 02:13:43.315
WHO IS THE VICTIM OF A PRIA.

02:13:43.382 --> 02:13:46.518

THAT. ALLEGATION WAS HANDLED BY

02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:53.358
THE DEPARTMENT. THEN WE LOOK AT

02:13:53.425 --> 02:13:55.227
IT BUT WE DON'T HAVE A

02:13:55.293 --> 02:13:57.362
MONITORING PROCESS THAT

02:13:57.429 --> 02:13:58.930
INDEPENDENTLY LOOKS AT HOW THE

02:13:58.997 --> 02:14:00.699

COMPLAINS- WHO HAS BEEN PART OF

02:14:10.275 --> 02:14:12.310
THE- WHO IS MADE OF A PRE A

02:14:12.377 --> 02:14:16.982
COMPLAINT- SO AGAIN I JUST

02:14:17.048 --> 02:14:19.418
WANTED TO CLARIFY WHAT OUR PRIA

02:14:19.484 --> 02:14:23.955
OF MONITORING IS THANK YOU AND

02:14:24.022 --> 02:14:25.624

OUTLINED IN THE STATUTE CHANGE

02:14:49.114 --> 02:14:50.015

FROM DOING A ROBUST MONITORING

02:17:18.563 --> 02:17:21.766
FROM THE- ACCEPTANCE OR NON

02:17:21.833 --> 02:17:24.235
ACCEPTANCE OF THE COMPLAINTS-

02:17:24.302 --> 02:17:25.570
AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE

02:17:25.637 --> 02:17:28.039
CASE HERE SEEMS TO BE THAT THE

02:17:28.106 --> 02:17:30.175
WARDENS ARE FULLY INVOLVED

02:17:30.241 --> 02:17:32.978
ACTIVELY INVOLVED. IN DECIDING

02:17:33.044 --> 02:17:35.013
WHICH CASES ARE AIRED

02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:36.348
GRIEVANCES OR IF THEIR

02:17:36.414 --> 02:17:39.451
INVESTIGATIONS OF SO HOW DO YOU

02:17:39.517 --> 02:17:42.420
RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE IS AS

02:17:42.487 --> 02:17:44.022
HE DESCRIBED IT. THE

02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:46.691
INSTITUTION OF THE WARDENS WERE

02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:47.259
NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A PART OF

02:17:47.325 --> 02:17:51.596
THIS. AND YET THEY ARE. I CAN'T

02:17:51.663 --> 02:17:55.500
SPEAK FOR THE PRIOR- AGENCY

02:17:55.567 --> 02:17:56.968
LEADS AS FAR AS WHAT THEIR

02:17:57.035 --> 02:17:59.537
AGREEMENTS FOR I CAN I CAN TELL

02:17:59.604 --> 02:18:00.872
YOU FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WHERE

02:18:00.939 --> 02:18:04.709
WE'RE GOING TO GO FROM HERE-

02:18:04.776 --> 02:18:07.312
AND HONESTLY THIS. THAT THE

02:18:07.379 --> 02:18:11.116
DEFINITION WILL LIKELY TO LEAD

02:18:11.182 --> 02:18:13.451
TO ADVERSE ACTION. IS

02:18:13.518 --> 02:18:15.553
RELATIVELY COMPLEX WITH THE

02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:16.688
INFORMATION YOU HAVE IN FRONT

02:18:16.755 --> 02:18:18.356
OF YOU YOU NEED ADDITIONAL

02:18:18.423 --> 02:18:20.792
INFORMATION I WILL SAY THAT THE

02:18:20.859 --> 02:18:21.993
WARDENS WERE NOT INTENTIONALLY

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:24.996
NOT SENDING THINGS OFF TO AIMS

02:18:25.063 --> 02:18:26.331
IT JUST SOMETIMES DIDN'T HAVE

02:18:26.398 --> 02:18:27.632
ENOUGH BASED ON ALL THE VARIOUS

02:18:27.699 --> 02:18:29.534
DEFINITIONS AND EXCLUSIONARY

02:18:29.601 --> 02:18:32.037
CRITERIA THAT'S WHAT MADE IT

02:18:32.103 --> 02:18:34.706
MADE IT SO DIFFICULT. SO I DO

02:18:34.773 --> 02:18:36.808
THINK THAT RESOLVING THAT

02:18:36.875 --> 02:18:38.810
PROBLEM BY HAVING A CENTRALIZED

02:18:38.877 --> 02:18:40.745
PROCESS OUTSIDE OF THE

02:18:40.812 --> 02:18:42.514
INSTITUTIONS WILL BE HELPFUL

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:44.416
BUT AS I SAID THERE WE FOUND NO

02:18:44.482 --> 02:18:45.417
EVIDENCE THAT WARNS WERE

02:18:45.483 --> 02:18:48.286
INTENSELY NOT SENDING ANYTHING

02:18:48.353 --> 02:18:50.722
OFF TO AIMS I MEAN AND I CAN

02:18:50.789 --> 02:18:52.223
AND I WANT TO JUST REITERATE

02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:54.826
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE WELL OVER

02:18:54.893 --> 02:18:56.061
TWO THOUSAND INVESTIGATIONS

02:18:56.127 --> 02:18:57.796
FORMAL INVESTIGATIONS AT

02:18:57.862 --> 02:19:00.365
WHARTON CENTER EVERY SINGLE.

02:19:00.432 --> 02:19:08.373
YEAR. OF THE OF THE TWO

02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:11.242
THOUSAND- ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE

02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:13.178
SENT TO THE WARDEN'S ONLY FIVE

02:19:13.244 --> 02:19:15.547
HUNDRED WENT TO AMES. WHAT I

02:19:15.613 --> 02:19:18.416
CAN HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE. IT'S

02:19:18.483 --> 02:19:20.719
VERY SIX CLOSURE CRITERIA THAT

02:19:20.785 --> 02:19:23.655
WE HAD. THAT DAY THEY GO ONCE

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:26.458
INTO DIFFERENT BUCKETS AND ALL

02:19:26.524 --> 02:19:32.030
ALL USE- WHETHER IT'S- A RULES

02:19:32.097 --> 02:19:33.598
VIOLATION REPORTS THAT MIGHT

02:19:33.665 --> 02:19:35.967
HAVE HAD- A DUE PROCESS

02:19:36.034 --> 02:19:39.070
VIOLATION BUT NOT NECESSARILY

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:42.173
YOU KNOW LIEUTENANT JONES WAS

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:46.010
DISRESPECTFUL. IT'S A PROCESS

02:19:46.077 --> 02:19:49.881
ALLEGATION VERSE SAYS- YOU KNOW

02:19:49.948 --> 02:19:53.384
WHAT MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS- SO

02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:54.919
THERE'S A VARIETY OF REASONS

02:19:54.986 --> 02:19:56.287
WHY THINGS GOT SCREENED OUT

02:19:56.354 --> 02:19:57.422
BASED ON THE SCREEN OUT

02:19:57.489 --> 02:19:59.457
CRITERIA AS WELL AS THE

02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:01.359
DEFINITION THAT MADE IT VERY IT

02:20:01.426 --> 02:20:02.727
MADE IT TOO COMPLEX FOR THE

02:20:02.794 --> 02:20:05.463
INSTITUTIONS. TO START WITH I

02:20:05.530 --> 02:20:07.432
MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THE BOTTOM

02:20:07.499 --> 02:20:09.667
LINE FOR THE ISSUE AND I DO

02:20:09.734 --> 02:20:11.736
FEEL LIKE THIS PROCESS OTHER

02:20:11.803 --> 02:20:13.438
MAYBE SOME THAT ARE GOING TO BE

02:20:13.505 --> 02:20:15.240
RETURNED TO THE INSTITUTIONS

02:20:15.306 --> 02:20:16.107
FOR ANALYSIS OF THE RULES

02:20:16.174 --> 02:20:20.779
VIOLATION REPORT FOR- DUE

02:20:20.845 --> 02:20:22.781
PROCESS VIOLATION IN THE JUST.

02:20:22.847 --> 02:20:25.683
MAKE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS- AND

02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:26.851
OF COURSE AS WE JUST TALKED

02:20:26.918 --> 02:20:29.687
ABOUT YOU KNOW PRIA AND OTHERS

02:20:29.754 --> 02:20:32.357
YOU KNOW- THEY'RE DONE AT THE

02:20:32.423 --> 02:20:34.259
LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN OF COURSE

02:20:34.325 --> 02:20:35.994
YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A VERY

02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:39.197
ROBUST- PROCESS AS RELATES TO

02:20:39.264 --> 02:20:43.535
OUR USE OF FORCE- AND- I. G.

02:20:43.601 --> 02:20:44.402
BEARS ARE USED TO FORCE

02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:47.238
PROCESSES WELL. AND SO YOU KNOW

02:20:47.305 --> 02:20:48.807
WE HAVE AGREED THAT THE

02:20:48.873 --> 02:20:50.842
ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE OR

02:20:50.909 --> 02:20:53.745
UNNECESSARY FORCE WILL GO AHEAD

02:20:53.812 --> 02:20:55.313
AND TO BE PROCESSED BY AIMS.

02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:57.315
THE INSTITUTION WILL HOLD THEIR

02:20:57.382 --> 02:20:59.184
USE OF FORCE COMMITTEES UNTIL

02:20:59.250 --> 02:21:01.853
THEY GET THAT BACK- BUT THE

02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:03.454
OFFICE INSPECTOR GENERAL IS

02:21:03.521 --> 02:21:04.489
SITTING OUT ON THOSE

02:21:04.556 --> 02:21:07.525
COMMITTEES. SO I REALIZE THE

02:21:07.592 --> 02:21:09.561
NUMBERS SEEM. AND I WANT TO

02:21:09.627 --> 02:21:11.095
MAKE TWO FOUR FOUR ONE OTHER

02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:13.131
POINT THE NUMBERS MISTER WESLEY

02:21:13.198 --> 02:21:16.334
IS REFERRING TO- AS FAR AS THE

02:21:16.401 --> 02:21:18.102
TWO THOUSAND DOWN TO FIVE

02:21:18.169 --> 02:21:20.038
HUNDRED ARE NOT THE SAME TWO

02:21:20.104 --> 02:21:21.539
THOUSAND THAT I'M REFERRING TO

02:21:21.606 --> 02:21:23.041
THAT WERE FORMERLY BEST ENGAGED

02:21:23.107 --> 02:21:25.543
OR MAKE SURE THAT. HIS ACTION

02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:29.147
BECAUSE WE HOW OF- AT ANY TIME

02:21:29.214 --> 02:21:31.115
STAFF CAN HAVE A VARIETY OF

02:21:31.182 --> 02:21:33.017
MISCONDUCT WHETHER IT'S INMATE

02:21:33.084 --> 02:21:36.054
RELATED OR OFF DUTY MISCONDUCT.

02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:38.623
THAT IS REFERRED TO THE OFFICE

02:21:38.690 --> 02:21:40.625
OF THE TROUBLE. THOSE CASES ARE

02:21:40.692 --> 02:21:42.594
INVESTIGATED THE OFFICER THE

02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:44.462
SPECTER GENERAL SENSE- AT THE

02:21:44.529 --> 02:21:46.364
CENTRAL INTAKE PROCESS ON DAY

02:21:46.431 --> 02:21:49.400
ONE. WHEN THAT CASE IS BEING

02:21:49.467 --> 02:21:50.668
EVALUATED TO MAKE A

02:21:50.735 --> 02:21:52.670
DETERMINATION WHETHER IT'S

02:21:52.737 --> 02:21:53.972
GOING TO GO FOR FORMAL

02:21:54.038 --> 02:21:55.807
INVESTIGATION OVER THIS COULD

02:21:55.874 --> 02:21:58.409
BE SENT BACK TO THE INSTITUTE.

02:21:58.476 --> 02:22:01.079
FOR A DIRECT. ACTION MEANING

02:22:01.145 --> 02:22:02.881
THERE'S ENOUGH INFORMATION AND

02:22:02.947 --> 02:22:06.351
I'LL USE AN EXAMPLE IF THE- REX

02:22:06.417 --> 02:22:11.055
LAW OFFICER IS ARRESTED FOR-

02:22:11.122 --> 02:22:13.157
DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. WE

02:22:13.224 --> 02:22:14.926
HAVE A POLICE REPORT WE HAVE

02:22:14.993 --> 02:22:16.895
ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED WE

02:22:16.961 --> 02:22:18.429
DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO DO AN

02:22:18.496 --> 02:22:20.098
INVESTIGATION. BUT WE HAVE TO

02:22:20.164 --> 02:22:22.700
TAKE THIS ACTION. SO IS THOSE

02:22:22.767 --> 02:22:25.670
KIND OF NEW WANTS SAYS- BUT IF

02:22:25.737 --> 02:22:27.605
AN INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED.

02:22:27.672 --> 02:22:28.706
WHEN IT GOES FOR FULL

02:22:28.773 --> 02:22:30.842
INVESTIGATION IN THAT PROCESS-

02:22:30.909 --> 02:22:32.577
I. G. GETS TO PICK WHICH CASES

02:22:32.644 --> 02:22:34.746
THEY WANT TO DO DEPEND UPON THE

02:22:34.812 --> 02:22:36.214
SEVERITY OF THE ALLEGATIONS.

02:22:36.281 --> 02:22:39.751
AND PROCEED THROUGH THE THROUGH

02:22:39.817 --> 02:22:42.420
THE ENTIRE PROCESS- FROM THE

02:22:42.487 --> 02:22:45.089
INVESTIGATION. TO THE FINAL

02:22:45.156 --> 02:22:46.858
DETERMINATION OF THE PENALTY AT

02:22:46.925 --> 02:22:49.560
THE LOCAL INSTITUTION AS WELL

02:22:49.627 --> 02:22:50.895
AS FOLLOWS IT ALL THE WAY

02:22:50.962 --> 02:22:52.163
THROUGH THE STATE PERSONNEL

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:54.299
BOARD PROCESS. IF YOU ASK

02:22:54.365 --> 02:22:55.900
MEMBER FEELS THAT. WE'RE

02:22:55.967 --> 02:22:58.269
TALKING TO DIFFERENT THINGS-

02:22:58.336 --> 02:23:01.406
AND SO THAT WAS CLEAR I HAVE

02:23:01.472 --> 02:23:02.373
ONE MORE QUESTION AND THEN I'LL

02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:04.909
OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES- IN

02:23:04.976 --> 02:23:07.645
THE NEW PROCESS THAT YOU ARE

02:23:07.712 --> 02:23:09.547
SUGGESTING AND RECOMMENDING.

02:23:09.614 --> 02:23:15.887
ARE THE WARD IS. GOING TO BE A

02:23:15.954 --> 02:23:17.355
PART OF THAT PROCESS- DISCRETE

02:23:17.422 --> 02:23:18.589
FOR. VERY WILL NOT BE PART OF

02:23:18.656 --> 02:23:20.325
THAT NO WE TAKE THOSE. THE

02:23:20.391 --> 02:23:21.292
GRIEVANCE COORDINATOR

02:23:21.359 --> 02:23:23.027
VANSITTART WILL COLLECT THEIR

02:23:23.094 --> 02:23:24.095
GRIEVANCES FROM THEIR

02:23:24.162 --> 02:23:26.264
INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES

02:23:26.331 --> 02:23:26.764
INDIVIDUAL YARDS AT THE

02:23:26.831 --> 02:23:28.566
INSTITUTION. AND THEY WILL

02:23:28.633 --> 02:23:30.702
PACKAGE THEM UP AND SEND THEM

02:23:30.768 --> 02:23:32.103
TO A FIRST BILL WORKING OUT

MAIL SENT I. STAFFER STILL

02:23:38.609 --> 02:23:40.345
LOOKING AT THAT PIECE OF IT BUT

02:23:40.411 --> 02:23:42.413
THOSE WILLING WILL NOT GO

02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:45.183
THROUGH A LOCALIZED REMAIN- IT

02:23:45.249 --> 02:23:47.418
WILL JUST BE. I SHOULDN'T SAY

02:23:47.485 --> 02:23:48.419
IT WILL GO THROUGH ALL THAT

02:23:48.486 --> 02:23:49.787
ADVERSITY GREENS CARD IT'LL

02:23:49.854 --> 02:23:52.290
EVALUATE MAKE SURE. O. OKAY

THINK IT A LUNCH YES. I'M A

02:23:56.995 --> 02:23:58.529
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT KIND OF

02:23:58.596 --> 02:24:01.399
PLAY OR MY LUNCH WAS. HOLDER

02:24:01.466 --> 02:24:04.102
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE- YOU

STILL HAVE GRIEVANCES THAT ARE

02:24:05.803 --> 02:24:07.271
NOT STAFF COMPLAIN SO HE'LL

02:24:07.338 --> 02:24:09.407
MAKE THAT INITIAL DETERMINATION

02:24:09.474 --> 02:24:11.242
AND THEN SPEND THAT. THOSE WILL

02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:14.812
BE. OUT FOR SCREENING AND THE

02:24:14.879 --> 02:24:17.448
DETERMINATION OF WHAT'S

02:24:17.515 --> 02:24:19.217
PROCESS- WHERE WHERE IT NEEDS

02:24:19.283 --> 02:24:20.585
TO GO IS THERE ENOUGH FOR AN

02:24:20.651 --> 02:24:22.520
INVESTIGATION CURRENTLY DO WE

MAKE A DETERMINATION. ON-

02:24:31.763 --> 02:24:32.764
WHAT'S THE BEST COURSE OF

02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:34.899
ACTION AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THE

FACILITY. OR IS THAT WHAT IT IS

02:24:43.307 --> 02:24:44.776

FIFTEEN HUNDRED CASES OF TWO

02:25:08.032 --> 02:25:09.300
THOUSAND. WHICH I THINK BASED

02:33:07.778 --> 02:33:10.447
REFERRAL RATE OF THOSE CASES.

02:33:10.514 --> 02:33:11.181
SO THERE APPEARS TO BE A

02:33:11.248 --> 02:33:14.084
DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN WHETHER IT

02:33:14.151 --> 02:33:16.387
GETS REFERRED BY STAFF OR

02:33:16.453 --> 02:33:18.889
WHETHER IT GETS REFERRED BY- AN

02:33:18.956 --> 02:33:20.791
INCARCERATED PERSON SO I THINK

02:33:20.858 --> 02:33:24.495
THAT WAS THE DISCONNECT- THE-

02:33:24.562 --> 02:33:28.899
THE ACTUAL- FINDINGS UNDER THE-

02:33:28.966 --> 02:33:30.701
OF THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS PROCESS

02:33:30.768 --> 02:33:31.835
THE GETS ELEVATED THROUGH

02:33:31.902 --> 02:33:35.005
STAFF. IS ABOUT 54% OF THOSE

02:33:35.072 --> 02:33:37.875
CASES- MISCONDUCT- THE

02:33:37.942 --> 02:33:40.344
ALLEGATIONS ARE SUSTAINED- THEY

02:33:40.411 --> 02:33:41.545
DON'T ALL RESULT IN ADVERSE

02:33:41.612 --> 02:33:44.214
ACTION THEY RESULT IN A VARIETY

02:33:44.281 --> 02:33:47.284
FROM TRAINING TO- TO

02:33:47.351 --> 02:33:53.591
TERMINATION. BUT IT'S. PLAY

02:33:53.657 --> 02:33:57.528
PROCESS. THERE ACTUALLY WAS NO

02:33:57.595 --> 02:34:01.966
OF SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF THE-

02:34:02.032 --> 02:34:04.902
THE WARDENS OUT OF THE TWO

02:34:04.969 --> 02:34:05.502
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY

02:34:05.569 --> 02:34:06.103
NINE COMPLAINTS THAT CAME UP

02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:06.837
THROUGH THE INCARCERATED

02:34:06.904 --> 02:34:09.840
PROCESS. REFERRED ABOUT FIVE

02:34:09.907 --> 02:34:10.908
HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE OF THOSE

02:34:10.975 --> 02:34:14.678
AND OF THOSE NONE RESULTED IN-

02:34:14.745 --> 02:34:18.215
IN ANY DISCIPLINE OR OR- FORMAL

02:34:18.282 --> 02:34:21.652
ACTION- SO I JUST WANTED TO

02:34:21.719 --> 02:34:26.790
KIND OF CLARIFY- THE DIFFERENCE

02:34:26.857 --> 02:34:28.425
IN AND WHAT WE WERE TALKING. I

02:34:28.492 --> 02:34:29.927
GUESS I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE

02:34:29.994 --> 02:34:31.161
THAT BUT IT'S PROBABLY STILL

02:34:31.228 --> 02:34:32.796
ALSO TRUE THAT A FAIRLY LARGE

02:34:32.863 --> 02:34:35.065
SHARE OF INMATE COMPLAINTS LEAD

02:34:35.132 --> 02:34:37.501
OR ARE CREDIBLE- AND DESERVING

02:34:37.568 --> 02:34:40.104
OF EXAMINATION LEAD TOWARD SOME

02:34:40.170 --> 02:34:41.872
SORT OF ADVERSE ACTION. SHOW IT

02:34:41.939 --> 02:34:43.440
AGAIN THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT

02:34:43.507 --> 02:34:44.642
IT'S IMPORTANT OVER TIME TO SEE

02:34:44.708 --> 02:34:47.578
IF. YOU CAN USE THAT DATA TO

02:34:47.645 --> 02:34:48.212
ASSESS WHETHER THINGS ARE

02:34:48.278 --> 02:34:52.282
IMPROVING. I THINK IT'S A GREAT.

02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:56.220
YES WE CERTAINLY. AGREE THAT

02:34:56.286 --> 02:34:58.956
THE DATA SYSTEMS HAVE TO BE-

02:34:59.023 --> 02:35:02.626
HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO

02:35:02.693 --> 02:35:05.596
RECORD WHAT IS HISTORICALLY

02:35:05.663 --> 02:35:07.398
HAPPENING BECAUSE- QUITE

02:35:07.464 --> 02:35:12.169
FRANKLY- UNDER THE STATE SYSTEM

02:35:12.236 --> 02:35:14.271
THE ADVERSE ACTION IS REALLY.

02:35:14.338 --> 02:35:17.508
THE WHOLE PROCESS IS- WITH THEM

02:35:17.574 --> 02:35:20.144
WHICH I THOUGHT IN MIND THATYOU'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE

02:35:20.210 --> 02:35:21.645
EMPLOYEES DISTRICT ARE-

02:35:21.712 --> 02:35:26.350
BEHAVIOR AND SO- IF SOMEBODY IS

02:35:26.417 --> 02:35:29.887
DISRESPECTFUL TO AN INMATE- THE

02:35:29.953 --> 02:35:31.255
FIRST TIME THAT MAY RESULT IN

02:35:31.321 --> 02:35:32.890
NOTHING MORE THAN COUNSELING

02:35:32.956 --> 02:35:34.191
BUT IF IT HAPPENS THE FIFTH

02:35:34.258 --> 02:35:37.594
TIME THAT MAY RESULT IN- IN

02:35:37.661 --> 02:35:39.663
DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND-

02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:42.666
THERE'S NO STE DATA SYSTEM.

02:35:42.733 --> 02:35:44.568
THAT CAN CAPTURE THAT RIGHT NOW.

02:35:44.635 --> 02:35:46.036
RIGHT INTO BY INFERENCE SHOULD

02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:47.504
SOMEBODY IS NOT IF THE

02:35:47.571 --> 02:35:49.707
COMPLAINT IS AND DOESN'T WORK-

02:35:49.773 --> 02:35:50.507
AND THAT SECOND THIRD FOURTH

02:35:50.574 --> 02:35:53.377
FIFTH INCIDENT- IS NOT CAPTURED

02:35:53.444 --> 02:35:54.978
YOU'LL GET NO IMPROVEMENT RIGHT

02:35:55.045 --> 02:35:56.447
IN THE SUIT. THAT'S CORRECT

02:35:56.513 --> 02:35:58.682

02:41:28.712 --> 02:41:29.546
LIABILITY THE STATE OF

02:41:29.613 --> 02:41:32.783
CALIFORNIA THE HAVE TO HAVE YOU.

02:41:32.849 --> 02:41:34.551
AN OPINION ON THAT OR AS

02:41:34.618 --> 02:41:40.557
COUNCIL. BUT WAITED ON THE. SO

02:41:40.624 --> 02:41:44.061
THE- THE FOCUS OF OUR REPORT

02:41:44.127 --> 02:41:48.565
WAS WHETHER STAFF MISCONDUCT-

02:41:48.632 --> 02:41:50.467
WAS INVOLVED IN THOSE

02:41:50.534 --> 02:41:55.372
ACTIVITIES SO- WHERE YOU HAVE

02:41:55.439 --> 02:41:57.107
FOR EXAMPLE A GRIEVANCE THAT

02:41:57.174 --> 02:41:58.742
THE PERSON WASN'T PROPERLY

02:41:58.809 --> 02:42:02.179
ACCOMMODATED. YOU CAN TAKE TWO

02:42:02.245 --> 02:42:05.515
FORMS ONE THAT- I NEEDED A

02:42:05.582 --> 02:42:07.651
WHEELCHAIR AND THEY JUST GAVE

02:42:07.717 --> 02:42:11.822
ME A WALKER- NO ALLEGATION THAT

02:42:11.888 --> 02:42:14.157
STAFF DID SOMETHING WRONG JUST

02:42:14.224 --> 02:42:16.293
THAT THE PERSON IS NOT

02:42:16.359 --> 02:42:21.364
SATISFIED WITH THE- WITH THE

02:42:21.431 --> 02:42:24.668
RESOLUTION OF THEIR REQUEST-

02:42:24.734 --> 02:42:26.269
THAT WOULD BE A ROUTINE

02:42:26.336 --> 02:42:28.638
GRIEVANCE- IT WOULD ASK THE

02:42:28.705 --> 02:42:30.273
DEPARTMENT TO TAKE A LOOK AT

02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:34.311
THIS AGAIN AND- AND- TELL THE

02:42:34.377 --> 02:42:36.580
PERSON WHETHER THEY HAVE

02:42:36.646 --> 02:42:37.180
CHANGED THEIR MIND ABOUT WHERE

02:42:37.247 --> 02:42:39.082
THEY GET A WHEELCHAIR. CONTRAST

02:42:39.149 --> 02:42:42.819
THAT WITH- SOMEBODY WHO SAYS

02:42:42.886 --> 02:42:46.957
THAT- AN OFFICER TOOK THEIR

02:42:47.023 --> 02:42:47.858
CAME AWAY FROM THEM FOR NO

02:42:47.924 --> 02:42:51.128
REASON. AND THAT THEY WERE

02:42:51.194 --> 02:42:53.864
ENTITLED TO HAVE THAT CAME. OF

02:42:53.930 --> 02:42:56.600
THAT WOULD BE THEN AN

02:42:56.666 --> 02:42:58.835
ALLEGATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT.

02:42:58.902 --> 02:43:01.338
AND UNDER THE DEPARTMENT'S

02:43:01.404 --> 02:43:03.373
HANDLING OF THAT IT JUST STAYS

02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:05.342
AS A ROUTINE GRIEVANCE UNDER

02:43:05.408 --> 02:43:08.512
THE ADA PROCESS. WHAT WE ARE

02:43:08.578 --> 02:43:10.914
SAYING IS THAT THOSE THE

02:43:10.981 --> 02:43:13.550
QUALITY OF THAT ACT. OF SHOULD

02:43:13.617 --> 02:43:16.786
QUALIFY IT FOR INCLUSION IN THE

02:43:16.853 --> 02:43:19.356
GAMES MISCONDUCT. INQUIRY TO

02:43:19.422 --> 02:43:22.959
FIND OUT WHETHER THIS OFFICER-

02:43:23.026 --> 02:43:26.897
DID IT. INTENTIONALLY REMOVED A

02:43:26.963 --> 02:43:29.833
REQUIRED ASSISTIVE DEVICE FROM

02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:31.801
UP FROM A PERSON WHO NEEDED IT.

02:43:31.868 --> 02:43:34.337
SO THAT'S THE I THINK THAT'S

02:43:34.404 --> 02:43:36.773
THE DIFFERENCE- THAT WE'RE

02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:38.808
LOOKING AT IN THOSE NUMBER OF

02:43:38.875 --> 02:43:42.379
CASES WHERE. IN IN IN THE

02:43:42.445 --> 02:43:44.214
REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE WE LOOKED

02:43:44.281 --> 02:43:48.952
AT WE SAW THINGS THAT- CLEARLY

02:43:49.019 --> 02:43:50.320
IN OUR MIND. LOOK AT THE

02:43:50.387 --> 02:43:52.389
BEHAVIOR OF THE OFFICE OFFICER

02:43:52.455 --> 02:43:54.858
AS OPPOSED TO WHETHER THE

02:43:54.925 --> 02:43:59.095
PERSON- WAS TREATED ACCORDING

02:43:59.162 --> 02:44:01.831
TO. THEIR OWN INTERNAL

02:44:01.898 --> 02:44:03.600
PROCESSES AND SIMPLY DIDN'T

02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:06.469
LIKE THE END RESULT. YOUR

APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT

02:44:07.871 --> 02:44:09.739
EXPLANATION OF IN BOTH EXAMPLES

02:44:09.806 --> 02:44:12.509
THAT YOU GAVE DO YOU HAVE

02:44:12.576 --> 02:44:16.046
CONFIDENCE THAT- THE DEPARTMENT

02:44:16.112 --> 02:44:17.581
IS REACHING CLOSURE. IN EITHER

02:44:17.647 --> 02:44:21.918
CASE. WELL MISCONDUCT OR NOT A

02:45:04.594 --> 02:45:06.162
THE MONTH MY CONCERN IS THE

02:45:06.229 --> 02:45:08.832

CONCERNS IT'S- HI THERE I'M

02:45:17.307 --> 02:45:18.375
TRYING TO RAISE TODAY

02:45:18.441 --> 02:45:19.943
SPECIFICALLY WITHOUT GETTING

02:45:20.010 --> 02:45:21.745
INTO THE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR

02:45:21.811 --> 02:45:23.446
OTHER QUESTIONS IS HOW DO WE

THESE EIGHTY EIGHT CLAIMS ARE

02:45:27.584 --> 02:45:30.587
WE- LEAVING AN AUDIT TRAIL-

02:45:30.654 --> 02:45:32.088
ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S

02:45:32.155 --> 02:45:35.025
UNRESOLVED EDA CLAIMS. THAT

02:45:35.091 --> 02:45:37.394
COULD LEAD TO LITIGATION. IN A

02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:39.396
NIGHT IF I DO HAVE ONE MORE

02:45:39.462 --> 02:45:42.065
QUESTION WHICH IS. MAYBE A

02:45:42.132 --> 02:45:44.267
COMET RELATIVE TO THE

02:45:44.334 --> 02:45:44.901
SECRETARY'S REQUEST FOR

02:45:44.968 --> 02:45:48.238
CAMERAS. DOES IT MAKE SENSE. TO

02:45:48.305 --> 02:45:51.641
PUT CAMERAS ON THE SITUATION-

02:45:51.708 --> 02:45:52.842
NOT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT

02:45:52.909 --> 02:45:54.878

LIABILITY STILL POINT. WITH

02:46:02.218 --> 02:46:04.854
REGARD TO THE ADA PROCESS THE

02:46:04.921 --> 02:46:07.490
PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS ARE VERY

02:46:07.557 --> 02:46:10.493
MUCH INVOLVED IN- IN THE

02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:13.630
PRISONS WELL LOOKING AT THE

02:46:13.697 --> 02:46:15.098
VERY THINGS THAT YOU'RE THAT

02:46:15.165 --> 02:46:17.634
YOU'RE INDICATING SO I KNOW

02:46:17.701 --> 02:46:20.937
THAT- THAT THESE ATTORNEYS GO

02:46:21.004 --> 02:46:21.438
IN AND DO WHAT THEY CALL

02:46:21.504 --> 02:46:23.840
ARMSTRONG TOURS AND THEY LOOK

02:46:23.907 --> 02:46:25.642
AT WHATEVER DOCUMENTATION THE

02:46:25.709 --> 02:46:27.977
DEPARTMENT HAS- THE DEPARTMENT

02:46:28.044 --> 02:46:31.781
IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A- A

02:46:31.848 --> 02:46:34.250
PROCESS BY WHICH DAY- RECORD

02:46:34.317 --> 02:46:36.753
ALL OF THESE. EIGHTY EIGHT

02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:40.690
ALLEGATIONS AND- AND THEN THESE

02:46:40.757 --> 02:46:42.759
ADVOCATES LOOK AT THOSE TO

02:46:42.826 --> 02:46:43.760
DETERMINE WHETHER THE

02:46:43.827 --> 02:46:44.794
DEPARTMENT HAS PROPERLY

02:46:44.861 --> 02:46:46.496
ADDRESSED THEM OR NOT AGAIN

02:46:46.563 --> 02:46:49.199
THAT'S OUTSIDE THE PURVIEW OF

02:46:49.265 --> 02:46:52.969
OUR- MONITORING- BUT I DO

02:46:53.036 --> 02:46:55.672
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS THAT THAT

02:46:55.739 --> 02:46:57.507
IS THE SOURCE OF A LOT OF THE-

02:46:57.574 --> 02:46:59.976
LITIGATION THAT'S GOING ON WITH

02:47:00.043 --> 02:47:02.612
THE WITH THE ADVOCATES THAT-

02:47:02.679 --> 02:47:04.948
FROM WHAT I'VE READ IN IN THE

02:47:05.014 --> 02:47:07.717
ARMSTRONG PLEADINGS. OF THOSE

02:47:07.784 --> 02:47:11.621
ISSUES ARE ROUTINELY RAISED IN

02:47:11.688 --> 02:47:13.890
THE ARMSTRONG REPORTS- SO OFTEN

02:47:13.957 --> 02:47:15.959
BUT BUT TO ANSWER DIRECTLY YOUR

02:47:16.025 --> 02:47:18.661
QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE

02:47:18.728 --> 02:47:20.163
ENOUGH INFORMATION TO HAVE ANY

02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:22.966
CONFIDENCE IN HOW THE PROCESS.

02:47:23.032 --> 02:47:28.037
OF IN ARMSTRONG GENERALLY IS

02:47:28.104 --> 02:47:28.938
ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE

02:47:29.005 --> 02:47:32.542
ISSUES. WELL HOW IT WAS IS THIS

02:47:32.609 --> 02:47:34.043
IS MY IS MY STAFF'S

02:47:34.110 --> 02:47:35.545
INTERPRETATION OR IS THIS YOUR

02:47:35.612 --> 02:47:37.714
STATEMENT OR RENDITION OF YOUR

02:47:37.781 --> 02:47:41.050
STATEMENT THE FORTY TWO

02:47:41.117 --> 02:47:43.586
HUNDRED. OF THE FORTY THOUSAND

02:47:43.653 --> 02:47:44.154
SEVENTY THREE GRIEVANCES MAY

02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:46.423
HAVE BEEN MISS CHARACTERIZED AS

02:47:46.489 --> 02:47:48.825
A ROUTINE GRIEVANCE. ARE THOSE

02:47:48.892 --> 02:47:51.761
YOUR NUMBERS YES YES THOSE ARE

02:47:51.828 --> 02:47:55.598
THOSE ARE- THOSE ARE NUMBERS

02:47:55.665 --> 02:47:58.501
BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF SOURCE

02:47:58.568 --> 02:48:02.272
DOCUMENTS WHERE- THE GRIEVANCE-

02:48:02.338 --> 02:48:05.708
CLEARLY SAID IN HIS- IN HIS

02:48:05.775 --> 02:48:07.811
GRIEVANCE THAT OFFICER SO AND

02:48:07.877 --> 02:48:10.213
SO WAS FOR EXAMPLE DISHONEST

02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:12.782
WHEN HE DID WHAT I WHAT. WHAT

02:48:12.849 --> 02:48:17.754
I'M ACCUSING HIM OF DOING- AND-

02:48:17.821 --> 02:48:19.756
WITHOUT COMMENTING ON THE TRUTH

02:48:19.823 --> 02:48:21.391
YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T GET TO THE

02:48:21.458 --> 02:48:23.259
TRUTH UNTIL YOU UNTIL YOU

02:48:23.326 --> 02:48:28.131
INVESTIGATE BUT- IN OUR MIND OF

02:48:28.198 --> 02:48:29.699
THOSE THINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN

02:48:29.766 --> 02:48:31.701
CATEGORIZED AS STAFF MISCONDUCT

02:48:31.768 --> 02:48:34.270
CLAIMS BUT BECAUSE THEY DEALT

02:48:34.337 --> 02:48:37.807
WITH ADA. OF WARDENS ROUTINELY

02:48:37.874 --> 02:48:40.510
RE CATEGORIZE THOSE TO ROUTINE

02:48:40.577 --> 02:48:43.146
APPEALS A ROUTINE GRIEVANCES

02:48:43.213 --> 02:48:46.983
AND ASSIGN THEM THROUGH THE-

02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:50.186
THE ADA PROCESS THROUGH AN ATA

02:48:50.253 --> 02:48:51.955
WARD. INTO THAT IS THE REASON

02:48:52.021 --> 02:48:53.656
THAT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER

02:48:53.723 --> 02:48:56.159
OR NOT. THERE THERE'S A PROBLEM

02:48:56.226 --> 02:48:57.760
THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT. IN A

02:48:57.827 --> 02:48:59.863
POSITION. TO SEE THOSE COME

02:48:59.929 --> 02:49:01.364
THROUGH THE AIMS PROCESS EVEN

02:49:01.431 --> 02:49:02.599
THOUGH YOU'RE SAYING THEY WERE

02:49:02.665 --> 02:49:03.666
LIKELY MIS CHARACTERIZING

02:49:03.733 --> 02:49:04.868
SHOULD COME THROUGH THE AIMS

02:49:04.934 --> 02:49:06.603
PROCESS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S

02:49:06.669 --> 02:49:09.606
CORRECT AND- IF IT GOES THROUGH

02:49:09.672 --> 02:49:11.474
A CENTRALIZED AIMS PROCESS.

02:49:11.541 --> 02:49:13.543
THEN I CAN HAVE PEOPLE THERE TO

02:49:13.610 --> 02:49:17.380
MONITOR THAT PROCESS AND FERRET

02:49:17.447 --> 02:49:19.415
OUT THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES- THE

02:49:19.482 --> 02:49:21.985
WAY IT CURRENTLY- IS

02:49:22.051 --> 02:49:24.287
STRUCTURED. OTHERS THIRTY FIVE

02:49:24.354 --> 02:49:25.622
DIFFERENT PRISONS THERE'S

02:49:25.688 --> 02:49:27.590
THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT- ACTORS

02:49:27.657 --> 02:49:31.694
IN THIS AND WE ARE NOT- WE'RE

02:49:31.761 --> 02:49:37.066
NOT INVOLVED AT THE- LEVEL WHEN

02:49:37.133 --> 02:49:37.767
AWARDING MAKES THAT DECISION

02:49:37.834 --> 02:49:41.237
BECAUSE- WE- WE HAVE NO

02:49:41.304 --> 02:49:44.507
RESOURCES TO GO TO THAT LEVEL.

02:49:44.574 --> 02:49:46.309
AND REVIEW THOSE WE ARE LOOKING

02:49:46.376 --> 02:49:49.579
AT WHAT COMES TO AIMS AND THEN

02:49:49.646 --> 02:49:51.247
MAKING A DETERMINATION BASED ON

02:49:51.314 --> 02:49:54.217
WHAT WE SEE THERE. I APPRECIATE

02:49:54.284 --> 02:49:56.019

INTO THE ADA PROCESS I'M

02:50:01.457 --> 02:50:04.394
CONCERNED ABOUT ANY PERCENTAGE

HAVE BEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. YOU

02:50:13.603 --> 02:50:15.405
KNOW MY SCENARIO YOU GIVE A

02:50:15.471 --> 02:50:17.740
COUPLE EXAMPLES WOULD BE A AN

02:50:17.807 --> 02:50:20.043
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS COMPLAINING

02:50:20.109 --> 02:50:22.078
THAT HE OR SHE HASN'T RECEIVED

RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE I

02:52:29.272 --> 02:52:31.541
THINK WITH SOMETHING ON ISSUE

02:52:31.607 --> 02:52:37.580
THAT CENTER NEWMAN. RAISED IS-

02:52:37.647 --> 02:52:40.083
WHEN AIMS WAS ESTABLISHED IT

02:52:40.149 --> 02:52:43.152
WAS IN TWENTY NINETEEN- THEY

02:52:43.219 --> 02:52:45.354
WERE FORTY SEVEN POSITIONS. OF

02:52:45.421 --> 02:52:47.190
THAT CAME WITH IT AND IT WAS

02:52:47.256 --> 02:52:48.725
WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT WAS

02:52:48.791 --> 02:52:51.060
BASED ON. SOMETHING IF I HAVE

02:52:51.127 --> 02:52:53.129
THIS RIGHT SOMETHING LIKE FOUR

MONTH- IT'S NOT THE- ANYWHERE

02:52:59.769 --> 02:53:01.838
NEAR THAT SO I THINK WE NEED TO

02:53:01.904 --> 02:53:03.973
LOOK IN TERMS OF RESOURCES. IS

02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:05.742
IT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OR IS

02:53:05.808 --> 02:53:07.176
IT HOW THE CURRENT RESOURCES

02:53:07.243 --> 02:53:09.178
ARE ARE BEING USED OR NOT USED

02:53:09.245 --> 02:53:10.680
AND I THINK THAT WAS. THERE WAS

02:53:10.747 --> 02:53:12.548
REFERENCE TO THAT BY THE

02:53:12.615 --> 02:53:14.717
INSPECTOR GENERAL AS TO THE-

02:53:14.784 --> 02:53:17.120
WHAT WHAT WHAT THE AVERAGE COST

02:53:17.186 --> 02:53:20.256
OF THE CASE. WAS OF HIM BECAUSE

02:53:20.323 --> 02:53:22.992
OF THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND

02:53:23.059 --> 02:53:26.629
STAFF TIME THAT WAS. AVAILABLE

02:53:26.696 --> 02:53:27.163

02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:30.066
RIGHT MISTER WESLEY. THE YES

02:53:30.133 --> 02:53:32.735
MADAM CHAIR THE- OF WHAT WE

02:53:32.802 --> 02:53:37.140
FOUND WAS THAT- AIMS IN A IN

02:53:37.206 --> 02:53:39.275
THE B. C. P. THAT WAS PRESENTED

02:53:39.342 --> 02:53:42.879
AND I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT- MAY

02:53:42.945 --> 02:53:45.314
HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE WORK-

02:53:45.381 --> 02:53:46.983
WITH THE AMOUNT OF WORK- THAT

02:53:47.049 --> 02:53:50.319
THEY CAN DO NOW- BUT THEY

02:53:50.386 --> 02:53:51.788
PROMISED FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY

02:53:51.854 --> 02:53:56.592
FOUR- INCREASE PER MONTH- BASED

02:53:56.659 --> 02:53:57.693
ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

02:53:57.760 --> 02:53:59.962
THEY HAVE THEY'RE DOING ONE OR

02:54:00.029 --> 02:54:02.398
TWO A MONTH- THERE IF THEY ARE

02:54:02.465 --> 02:54:06.836
SIGNIFICANTLY- BELOW. WHAT THEY

02:54:06.903 --> 02:54:08.204
PROMISED THEY WOULD DO I DON'T

02:54:08.271 --> 02:54:09.505
KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBER IS

02:54:09.572 --> 02:54:11.974
AND- SECRETARY ALLISON HAS

02:54:12.041 --> 02:54:14.544
INDICATED THEY'RE DOING- A WORK

02:54:14.610 --> 02:54:17.246
STUDY TO SEE. WHAT THAT RIGHT

02:54:17.313 --> 02:54:21.951
NUMBER IS- BUT- MY IMPRESSION

02:54:22.018 --> 02:54:24.887
IS THAT. AT THE MOMENT THEY

02:54:24.954 --> 02:54:26.355
COULD PROBABLY DO MORE AND

02:54:26.422 --> 02:54:29.292
THEY'RE NOT DOING IT AND SO.

02:54:29.358 --> 02:54:31.427
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THEY

02:54:31.494 --> 02:54:33.863
COULD DO FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY

02:54:33.930 --> 02:54:35.398
FOUR A MONTH MAYBE THEY COULD-

02:54:35.464 --> 02:54:37.934
BUT THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT WORKING

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:41.504
TO- TO THE- TO THE ABILITY THAT

02:54:41.571 --> 02:54:43.840
I THINK THEY COULD. EVEN IF

02:54:43.906 --> 02:54:45.675
IT'S LESS THAN THE FOUR HUNDRED

02:54:45.741 --> 02:54:48.811
SEVENTY FOUR MONTH- SO THAT WAS

02:54:48.878 --> 02:54:52.949
THAT WAS FAR OUR POINT. YEAH.

WAY IN THE PAST BUT MOST

03:00:52.341 --> 03:00:55.811
RECENT. THAT OF DOESN'T LEAD IN

03:00:55.878 --> 03:00:57.546
ANY OTHER DIRECTION EXCEPT TO

03:00:57.613 --> 03:00:59.682

COURTS HAVE TO INTERVENE THE

03:01:22.204 --> 03:01:24.740

03:01:24.807 --> 03:01:25.941

03:40:10.530 --> 03:40:12.332
CRITERIA AS THE ADMINISTRATION

03:40:12.399 --> 03:40:13.667

03:40:13.733 --> 03:40:17.504
PERSONABLE WILL WORK WITH- THE

03:40:17.571 --> 03:40:19.105
NUMBER OF USED TO AT LEAST THE

03:40:19.172 --> 03:40:20.340

STAY IN THIS AREA- IS THAT THIS

03:40:55.075 --> 03:40:57.010

THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT OTHER

03:54:04.163 --> 03:54:05.598
STAFF ARE NOT GOING TO BE

CRITICAL ROLE IN REALLY

03:54:19.979 --> 03:54:21.514

LSO HAVE ACCESS TO OUR

WERE GOING TO NEED TO REFER TO

03:54:32.591 --> 03:54:34.193
OTHER PARTNERS AND ORDER HAD

03:54:34.260 --> 03:54:36.061
GEORGE JOINT JURISDICTIONAL

03:54:36.128 --> 03:54:39.298
ISSUES- WE HAVE WONDERFUL

03:54:39.365 --> 03:54:40.466
LESSONS THAT WE WANT TO LEARN

03:54:40.533 --> 03:54:42.401
FROM OUR OFFICE OF FOSTER CARE

03:54:42.468 --> 03:54:44.103
THE OFFICE OF THE FOSTER CARE

03:54:44.170 --> 03:54:46.338
HOMES BUT SPENT- AS YOU KNOW

03:54:46.405 --> 03:54:47.740
FOR THESE YOU THERE'S A LOT OF

03:54:47.807 --> 03:54:48.974
YOUTH WHO INVOLVED IN THOSE

03:54:49.041 --> 03:54:51.410
SYSTEMS. AND SO WANT TO LOOK

03:54:51.477 --> 03:54:53.813
INTO THAT AND DETERMINE HOW WE

03:54:53.879 --> 03:54:55.548
CAN- WORK MORE COLLABORATIVELY

03:54:55.614 --> 03:54:57.049
WITH THEM AS WELL AND I THINK

03:54:57.116 --> 03:54:58.350
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS

03:54:58.417 --> 03:55:02.087
THAT WE REALLY SEE THIS ROLE-

03:55:02.154 --> 03:55:03.622
AS A WAY TO LEARN ABOUT HOW TO

03:55:03.689 --> 03:55:05.791
MAKE THINGS BETTER AND- AND

03:55:05.858 --> 03:55:08.427
THAT'S WHY THE COUNTY LIAISONS-

03:55:08.494 --> 03:55:10.029
WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE AND

03:55:10.095 --> 03:55:11.497
ALSO I THINK PEOPLE WILL

03:55:11.564 --> 03:55:13.265
CERTAINLY- HAVE A PRETTY ACTIVE

03:55:13.332 --> 03:55:15.434
ROLE IN RESPONDING TO THINGS

03:55:15.501 --> 03:55:16.936
THAT WE LEARNED FROM FROM WHAT

03:55:17.002 --> 03:55:18.771
COMES THROUGH THE OFFICE

03:55:18.838 --> 03:55:19.271
PERSONS RESPONSIBILITIES

03:55:19.338 --> 03:55:22.107
BECAUSE- WE WANT TO USE A

03:55:22.174 --> 03:55:24.210
FRANKLY A CARROT TO CREATE

03:55:24.276 --> 03:55:26.212
CHANGE AND STUFF SO THAT MEANS

03:55:26.278 --> 03:55:27.313
WE NEED TO TAKE WHAT WE LEARNED

03:55:27.379 --> 03:55:29.415
WHAT WE HEAR. AND OF COURSE IF

03:55:29.482 --> 03:55:31.150
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT SERIOUS

03:55:31.217 --> 03:55:34.286
YOUNG PEOPLE HORRIBLE WE'RE

03:55:34.353 --> 03:55:36.722
GOING TO ACTION- BUT IF IT

03:55:36.789 --> 03:55:37.857
MEANS IF WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS

03:55:37.923 --> 03:55:39.258
THE PROGRAMS NEED TO PRINT

03:55:39.325 --> 03:55:41.794
IMPROVE OR THEIR KIDS ENDING UP

03:55:41.861 --> 03:55:42.628
IN THE SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE

03:55:42.695 --> 03:55:44.463
GOTTEN SERVICES EARLIER THOSE

03:55:44.530 --> 03:55:45.731
ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO

03:55:45.798 --> 03:55:47.700
INGEST OF ADDRESS WITH OTHER

ENOUGH. FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH

03:55:59.812 --> 03:56:00.813
WHAT HAVE NOT AND SO I KNOW

03:56:00.880 --> 03:56:02.081
IT'S- IT LOOKS PAPER BECAUSE

03:56:02.147 --> 03:56:03.649
IT'S GOT THE TWO LITTLE. WITH

03:56:03.716 --> 03:56:04.316
THEIR NAY ON IT BUT IT'S REALLY

03:56:04.383 --> 03:56:06.118

IN A- AGAIN I COMMEND YOU FOR.

03:56:13.792 --> 03:56:14.260
YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE AS

03:56:14.326 --> 03:56:17.897
MUCH- NO EFFICIENCY IS POSSIBLE

03:56:17.963 --> 03:56:20.399
I GUESS THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD-

03:56:20.466 --> 03:56:22.868
BUT YOU KNOW IN YOUR- IN YOUR

03:56:22.935 --> 03:56:25.237
QUEST TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

03:56:25.304 --> 03:56:29.608
POSITIONS ARE THERE ARE TWO- I

03:56:29.675 --> 03:56:30.175
DON'T SEE TROUBLE SHE WOULD

03:56:30.242 --> 03:56:32.177
MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER. AT

03:56:32.244 --> 03:56:33.679
ALMOST RATHER SEE THE

03:56:33.746 --> 03:56:36.882
INVESTMENT- IN IN MORE OF A

03:56:36.949 --> 03:56:40.319
SURVEY AND- I WANT TO SEE

03:56:40.386 --> 03:56:41.420
MENTORSHIP BECAUSE THAT'S A

03:56:41.487 --> 03:56:43.589
STRETCH BUT IT'S A ROLE AS

03:56:43.656 --> 03:56:44.924
OPPOSED TO A COMPLAINT DRIVEN

03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:47.226
ROLE IN IT I GUESS IN MY MIND

03:56:47.293 --> 03:56:53.799
SIGH- HAVING. YOU THOUGHT THERE

03:56:53.866 --> 03:56:55.501
WHO WERE NOT INCLINED TO CHECK

03:56:55.568 --> 03:56:57.536
IN WHO WITHOUT SOMEBODY

03:56:57.603 --> 03:56:59.672
CHECKING IN WITH THEM HAVING

03:56:59.738 --> 03:57:01.373
AGAIN SOME OF THIS IS MY

03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:02.942
EXPERIENCE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL

03:57:03.008 --> 03:57:04.977
AN ENEMY SAY I APPRECIATE YOUR

03:57:05.044 --> 03:57:07.112
RELIANCE ON A GOOD COUNTIES THE

03:57:07.179 --> 03:57:09.415
COUNTIES THAT ARE DOING A GOOD

03:57:09.481 --> 03:57:11.850
EFFORT BUT- THEY ALSO DON'T.

03:57:11.917 --> 03:57:13.485
REALLY HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF

03:57:13.552 --> 03:57:14.887
LEASE CURRENTLY OF SUPERVISION

03:57:14.954 --> 03:57:17.089
OUTSIDE OF INCARCERATION- AT A

03:57:17.156 --> 03:57:19.391
COUNTY LEVEL. OF OR ANY KIND OF

03:57:19.458 --> 03:57:21.126
MENTORSHIP IT'S GETTING BETTER

03:57:21.193 --> 03:57:22.528
I WOULD SAY EVEN IN A BIG

03:57:22.595 --> 03:57:23.596
COUNTY LIKE SANTA CLARA WHERE I

03:57:23.662 --> 03:57:26.065
COME FROM- THERE'S INCREASE

03:57:26.131 --> 03:57:28.434
EFFORTS TO. I TO CREATE THOSE

03:57:28.500 --> 03:57:29.568
KIND OF EXTERNAL SUPPORT

03:57:29.635 --> 03:57:32.237
SYSTEMS- BUT THEY REALLY DON'T

03:57:32.304 --> 03:57:34.573
FULLY EXIST IN. BLACK FACT THAT

03:57:34.640 --> 03:57:38.344
THEY DON'T EXIST TENDS TO LEAD

03:57:38.410 --> 03:57:41.313
TO- WITH SOME YOUTH- YOU'RE THE

03:57:41.380 --> 03:57:42.247
KIND OF RECIDIVISM THAT WE'RE

03:57:42.314 --> 03:57:44.917
TRYING TO AVOID SO- WHAT'S YOUR

03:57:44.984 --> 03:57:47.252
LET ME ASK YOU- WHAT YOUR

03:57:47.319 --> 03:57:50.022
FALLBACK POSITION IF TO ISN'T

03:57:50.089 --> 03:57:52.691
ENOUGH IN. YOU KNOW IMPROVING

03:57:52.758 --> 03:57:54.126
THE SYSTEM REALLY MEANS THAT

03:57:54.193 --> 03:57:57.129
YOU HAVE TO HAVE. OF MORE MORE

03:57:57.196 --> 03:58:01.533
HANDS ON MORE EYES- MORE. A

03:58:01.600 --> 03:58:02.134
MORE COMMUNICATION WITH THESE

03:58:02.201 --> 03:58:07.573
YOU. SO I THINK WHAT I WOULD

03:58:07.640 --> 03:58:09.742
SAY IS THAT THE OFFICE ALSO HAS

03:58:09.808 --> 03:58:11.510
A RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT

03:58:11.577 --> 03:58:14.079
DATA- AND TO USE THAT DATA TO

03:58:14.146 --> 03:58:15.714
DRIVE POLICY WE ALSO COME BACK

03:58:15.781 --> 03:58:17.783
HERE AND SHARE THAT DATA WITH

03:58:17.850 --> 03:58:18.283
WITH ALL OF YOU WITH THE

03:58:18.350 --> 03:58:20.019
LEGISLATURE SO DON'T KNOW IF I

03:58:20.085 --> 03:58:21.120
WOULD CALL IT SO MUCH OF THE

03:58:21.186 --> 03:58:24.590
BALL BACK- BENCH- OBVIOUSLY AN

03:58:24.657 --> 03:58:26.058
OPENNESS TO LEARNING WHAT WE

03:58:26.125 --> 03:58:30.129
NEED TO DO AND TO USE DATA. TO

03:58:30.195 --> 03:58:33.532
DRIVE THAT SO- AS I THINK THAT

03:58:33.599 --> 03:58:35.167
THAT IS ANOTHER THING THAT

03:58:35.234 --> 03:58:35.934
WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO

03:58:36.001 --> 03:58:37.403
LOOK AT AND THIS IS YOU KNOW

03:58:37.469 --> 03:58:38.971
AND THIS IS AN EXCITING AND

03:58:39.038 --> 03:58:40.839
IMPORTANT CHANGE BUT WE NEED TO

03:58:40.906 --> 03:58:41.774
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PAYING

03:58:41.840 --> 03:58:43.208
ATTENTION TO WHAT WE'RE

03:58:43.275 --> 03:58:44.843
LEARNING AND DAD. YOU KNOW

03:58:44.910 --> 03:58:48.147
AGAIN HAVE A COMMITMENT TO

03:58:48.213 --> 03:58:49.014
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. LAST

03:58:49.081 --> 03:58:50.716
QUESTION IN THIS REGARD IS. IF

03:58:50.783 --> 03:58:54.186
YOU WERE. BUDGETARY AUGMENTED

03:58:54.253 --> 03:58:56.455
SPECIFICALLY IN THE AREA WOULD

03:58:56.522 --> 03:58:58.390
YOU INCLINATION TO BE TO PUSH

03:58:58.457 --> 03:59:01.860
BACK ON THAT IT IS HAVING THE

03:59:01.927 --> 03:59:04.897
TWO SO COR AND TWO AND NO MORE.

03:59:04.963 --> 03:59:07.399
THAT IS SO CORE TO YOUR YOUR

03:59:07.466 --> 03:59:12.504
MODEL HERE THAT- YOU'RE NOT

03:59:12.571 --> 03:59:14.339
EVEN INTERESTED IN ADDITIONAL

CAN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT

03:59:19.712 --> 03:59:22.414
QUESTION- WHAT I CAN SAY AGAIN

03:59:22.481 --> 03:59:24.583
IS I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT

03:59:24.650 --> 03:59:26.785
THE OFFICE IS DEDICATING TO

03:59:26.852 --> 03:59:28.020
PEOPLE TO THE SERVICE I THINK

03:59:28.087 --> 03:59:30.689
IT'S DEDICATING- MUCH OF THE

03:59:30.756 --> 03:59:32.424

03:59:44.503 --> 03:59:47.139
STRUCTURE AND AS WE THINK THAT

03:59:47.206 --> 03:59:47.973
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

03:59:48.040 --> 03:59:48.974

ACCOMPLISH MORE WITH. WHAT WE

03:59:53.345 --> 03:59:55.581
PROPOSED DEAL. OKAY WELL THAT'S

03:59:55.647 --> 03:59:57.583
ALL I CAN DO IS ASKING INQUIRE

03:59:57.649 --> 03:59:59.418

THANK YOU YEAH. THANK YOU- I DO

04:02:25.898 --> 04:02:28.867
HAVE CONCERNS ALSO ABOUT THE-

04:02:28.934 --> 04:02:31.470
THE STAFFING LEVELS- ESPECIALLY

04:02:31.536 --> 04:02:33.171
AS I THINK THAT THEY ARE SET

04:02:33.238 --> 04:02:36.842
OUT IN SB EIGHT TO THREE- MY

04:02:36.909 --> 04:02:41.446
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- YOU'RE

04:02:41.513 --> 04:02:44.616
MAKING DECISIONS OR PROPOSALS

04:02:44.683 --> 04:02:47.185
BASED ON A MUCH SMALLER NUMBER

04:02:47.252 --> 04:02:49.154
OF YOUTH TO BE SERVED OTHER

04:02:49.221 --> 04:02:51.690
THAN WHAT I THINK IS LAID OUT

04:02:51.757 --> 04:02:54.293
IN SB EIGHT TO THREE SO I WOULD

04:02:54.359 --> 04:02:56.295
REALLY URGE AND COME BACK TO

04:02:56.361 --> 04:02:58.997
THE ISSUE OF HAVING- THE

04:02:59.064 --> 04:03:00.332
STAFFING THAT'S GOING TO BE

04:03:00.399 --> 04:03:03.201
NEEDED- TO MAKE THIS WORK. AND

04:03:03.268 --> 04:03:05.604
ALSO DO WE WANT TO MAKE IT WORK

04:03:05.671 --> 04:03:09.041
RIGHT- WE CAN ALWAYS BUT WE

04:03:09.107 --> 04:03:10.909
DON'T NEED THAT MANY WE CAN

04:03:10.976 --> 04:03:14.246
ALWAYS ADDRESS THAT BUT- MY

04:03:14.313 --> 04:03:16.014
CONCERN IS THAT WE START OUT

04:03:16.081 --> 04:03:18.550
WITH LESS THAN WHAT'S NEEDED-

04:03:18.617 --> 04:03:20.786
AND- SO I'D LIKE TO JUST PUT

04:03:20.852 --> 04:03:22.554
THAT OUT TO. A TO THE

04:03:22.621 --> 04:03:26.458

NEEDED ME THEY NEEDED

04:15:24.542 --> 04:15:26.678
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. I TO MAKE

IMPROVEMENTS TO THAT

04:15:27.445 --> 04:15:29.647

04:15:29.714 --> 04:15:31.582
BLUNTLY KINGS COUNTY EXPRESSED

04:15:31.649 --> 04:15:33.284
THAT THE NINE POINT SIX MILLION

TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

JUVENILE. REALIGNMENT- AND WE

04:15:44.328 --> 04:15:44.896
THINK THERE IS STEVEN NEED FOR

04:15:44.962 --> 04:15:47.265
ANY DAY FIFTY NINE- TO HELP

04:15:47.331 --> 04:15:48.332
PROBATION DEPARTMENT DEAL WITH

04:15:48.399 --> 04:15:51.169
WORK BUT IT THE STATE EIGHT

04:15:51.235 --> 04:15:53.037
THREE- SB AS DAY. THEY NOTE

04:15:53.104 --> 04:15:54.305
STATE EIGHTEEN FIFTY IS GO TO

04:15:54.372 --> 04:15:56.974
REDUCE PROBATION- TERM LIMITS

04:15:57.041 --> 04:15:58.409
AND PRESUMABLY REDUCE

04:15:58.476 --> 04:16:00.011
CASELOADS. ONE OF THE THINGS

04:16:00.078 --> 04:16:00.978
THAT WE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT

04:16:01.045 --> 04:16:04.282
ABOUT THAT IS THAT IT'S LIKELY

04:16:04.348 --> 04:16:05.917
TO END IMPACT- INDIVIDUALS ON

04:16:05.983 --> 04:16:07.452
LONGER PROBATION TERMS WERE

04:16:07.518 --> 04:16:10.088
LESS LIKELY TO OUR FANS-

04:16:10.154 --> 04:16:11.889
INSISTENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

04:16:11.956 --> 04:16:13.658
THEY HAVE MOST LIKELY

04:16:13.725 --> 04:16:15.126
RECIDIVISM IS BERLINA

04:16:15.193 --> 04:16:16.828
PROBATIONERS TERM INCIDENT

04:16:16.894 --> 04:16:18.629
THESE FUNDS ARE ARE MORE AND

04:16:18.696 --> 04:16:19.797
MORE INTENSE FRONT LOADING

04:16:19.864 --> 04:16:21.399
SERVICES RATHER THAN FINDING A

04:16:21.466 --> 04:16:22.533
DRESS IN THE BACK AND THE

04:16:22.600 --> 04:16:23.968
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT COME EARLIER

04:16:24.035 --> 04:16:26.404
OFF THOSE PROBATION TERMS. AS

04:16:26.471 --> 04:16:28.272
BASIC KIND OF FACE TO FACE

04:16:28.339 --> 04:16:30.475
THOSE IN AN INDOOR THE STATE ON

04:16:30.541 --> 04:16:31.943
PROBATION TERMS SO WE THINK

04:16:32.009 --> 04:16:34.078
IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THE

04:16:34.145 --> 04:16:34.712
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR COUNTIES

04:16:34.779 --> 04:16:37.582
NOW IT POPULATIONS CAN BE SIR-

04:16:37.648 --> 04:16:38.616
RIGHT WHEN THEY BEGIN THEIR

04:16:38.683 --> 04:16:39.917
PROBATION TERM SO THAT BY THE

04:16:39.984 --> 04:16:41.152
TIME THEY'RE OFF THOSE

04:16:41.219 --> 04:16:42.553
SHORTENEDSENTENCES THE RATE

04:16:42.620 --> 04:16:45.456
SET UP FOR SUCCESS- AS FAR AS

04:16:45.523 --> 04:16:46.390
THE LACK OF THE PLANNER

04:16:46.457 --> 04:16:48.693
METHODOLOGY WE'VE- WORKED OUT

04:16:48.760 --> 04:16:50.661
OF A CASE THAT BASED ON THAT

04:16:50.728 --> 04:16:51.596
PASSED FIVE YEARS OF COUNTY

PORTANTINO PROBATION

04:16:55.600 --> 04:16:57.268
POPULATIONS AND THE NUMBER OF

ANYBODY ELSE WHO'S INTERESTED

04:17:03.407 --> 04:17:04.776
KIND OF ALLOCATION WE'VE

04:17:04.842 --> 04:17:07.478
ESTABLISHED- AND IT KIND OF IS

04:17:07.545 --> 04:17:09.113
A CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL

04:17:09.180 --> 04:17:11.682
WORKLOADS. BUT AGAIN WE BELIEVE

04:17:11.749 --> 04:17:13.351
THAT THAT FUNDS SHOULD BE USED

04:17:13.417 --> 04:17:15.620
FLEXIBLY BY COUNTY PROBATION-

04:17:15.686 --> 04:17:17.522
AGENCIES INDIVIDUALLY AS THEY

04:17:17.588 --> 04:17:25.696

ROOM FOR ERROR I MEAN THESE ARE

04:32:59.730 --> 04:33:01.965
THE MOST COMPLEX SERIOUS CAES

04:33:02.032 --> 04:33:03.633
THAT BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN

04:33:03.700 --> 04:33:06.169

CASES SO. THIS TYPE OF. WORK IS

04:34:12.636 --> 04:34:16.706
LITERALLY START TO FINISH AND-

04:34:16.773 --> 04:34:21.444
EVEN IN. THE COMING UP WITH THE

04:34:21.511 --> 04:34:24.681
NUMBER OF CASES THAT WE ARE

04:34:24.748 --> 04:34:27.484
ANTICIPATING HAVING EVEN

04:34:27.551 --> 04:34:28.018

LEGISLATION WE'RE GONNA HAVE

04:34:29.953 --> 04:34:32.722
DIFFICULTIES FINDING WHAT CASES

04:34:33.690 --> 04:34:36.493
NOT HANDLE- IF THE GUNS LOADED

OR UNLOADED- WE HANDLE A CASE

04:34:39.229 --> 04:34:40.764
OR NOT HANDLE THE CASE- SO

04:34:40.831 --> 04:34:41.898
WE'RE TRYING TO EVEN WORK

04:34:41.965 --> 04:34:44.768
THROUGH- THE LEGISLATION WHICH

04:34:44.835 --> 04:34:46.636
DOESN'T MATCH CALIFORNIA. PENAL

04:34:46.703 --> 04:34:50.540
CODE LAWS SO OUR ESTIMATE OF

04:34:50.607 --> 04:34:52.475
FORTY CASES IS A ROUGH ESTIMATE

04:34:52.542 --> 04:34:55.312

OF OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS-

04:35:05.455 --> 04:35:06.690
WHICH IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY

04:35:06.756 --> 04:35:08.491
YEAR AND WE'VE DETERMINED

04:35:08.558 --> 04:35:13.196
THROUGH THAT- ABOUT TWENTY OF

04:35:13.263 --> 04:35:13.763
THOSE HUNDRED FORTY YEAR ON

04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:16.299
ARMS. ANOTHER NINE A REPLICA

04:35:16.366 --> 04:35:19.402
FIREARMS AND THEN ELEVEN WOULD

04:35:19.469 --> 04:35:21.872
BE- NOT CLASSIFIED AS DEADLY

04:35:21.938 --> 04:35:24.474
WEAPNS SO WE'RE WORKING WITH

04:35:24.541 --> 04:35:26.843

THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO-

04:35:37.921 --> 04:35:39.723
DESIGNATE TOWARDS THIS PROGRAM

04:35:39.789 --> 04:35:42.926
IS A MESS SO WE'VE DETERMINED

04:35:42.993 --> 04:35:45.362
THAT ABOUT 60% OF THESE CASES

04:35:45.428 --> 04:35:47.063
HAPPEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

04:35:47.130 --> 04:35:50.800

TO. WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL

04:43:31.594 --> 04:43:33.429
DIFFERENT AVENUES BUT RIGHT NOW

04:43:33.496 --> 04:43:35.865
THIS IS THE SITUATION WE FIND

04:43:35.932 --> 04:43:37.800
OURSELVES AND IS THAT THE

04:43:37.867 --> 04:43:39.268
GENERAL FUND BACKFILL IS WHAT

04:43:39.335 --> 04:43:41.304
WE'RE ASKING FOR BECAUSE THERE

04:43:41.371 --> 04:43:43.072
IS THAT SAME CONCERN ABOUT

04:43:43.139 --> 04:43:44.607
SMALLER COUNTIES AND SMALLER

04:43:44.674 --> 04:43:45.708
POPULATIONS ABILITY TO PAY%

04:43:45.775 --> 04:43:49.679
GETTING. EQUAL ACCESS TO THAT

04:43:49.746 --> 04:43:52.048
JUST. MMHM THANK ANYONE GIVE ME

04:43:52.115 --> 04:43:55.418
A IT OF WHAT THE ACTUAL

04:43:55.485 --> 04:43:58.588
CONCRETE IMPACT WOULD BE- IN A

04:43:58.654 --> 04:44:03.025
COMMUNITY. IF THEY COULD IF

04:44:03.092 --> 04:44:05.194
THEY COULD NOT- IF THEY COULD

04:44:05.261 --> 04:44:08.164
NOT OR WOULD NOT- PAY INTO- PAY

04:44:08.231 --> 04:44:11.100
FOR THESE COSTS. I'M SURE VERY

04:44:11.167 --> 04:44:14.337
MILLER AGAIN- THE I THINK WE

04:44:14.404 --> 04:44:15.738
ACTUALLY HAVE EXAMPLES OF THIS

04:44:15.805 --> 04:44:18.841
AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT WHEN WE

04:44:18.908 --> 04:44:20.143
DID OUR RESEARCH FOR AN

04:44:20.209 --> 04:44:21.878
ASSESSMENT THAT I PROVIDED TO

04:44:21.944 --> 04:44:24.547
THE LEGISLATURE. HE ONE OF THE

04:44:24.614 --> 04:44:26.082
AREAS THAT WE LOOKED AT WAS

04:44:26.149 --> 04:44:27.250
ACTUALLY A POLICE DEPARTMENT

04:44:27.316 --> 04:44:28.317
THAT DOES HAVE A FEE FOR

04:44:28.384 --> 04:44:30.653
SERVICE. MODEL WITH THEIR LOCAL

04:44:30.720 --> 04:44:32.422
AGENCIES AND WE FOUND THAT

04:44:32.488 --> 04:44:34.524
THERE WERE MANY SEXUAL ASSAULT

04:44:34.590 --> 04:44:36.025
EVIDENCE KITS THAT HAD NOT BEEN

04:44:36.092 --> 04:44:38.094
TURNED IN OR ANALYZED BECAUSE

04:44:38.161 --> 04:44:39.228
THE LOCAL AGENCY DIDN'T FEEL

04:44:39.295 --> 04:44:40.763
LIKE THEY CAN AFFORD. THE

04:44:40.830 --> 04:44:43.833
SERVICE AND SO WE DO SEE THAT.

04:44:43.900 --> 04:44:45.334
AS A POSSIBILITY THAT THOSE

04:44:45.401 --> 04:44:47.303
TYPES OF EVIDENCE COULD BE

04:44:47.370 --> 04:44:49.105
EITHER NOT TURNED IN BASED ON

04:44:49.172 --> 04:44:50.606
AN AGENCY MAKING FUNDING

04:44:50.673 --> 04:44:53.409
DECISIONS. THAT DON'T

04:44:53.476 --> 04:44:54.177
NECESSARILY SUPPORT BEST

04:44:54.243 --> 04:44:57.280
EVIDENCE. OR THEY DECIDE THAT

04:44:57.346 --> 04:44:58.648
THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKETHE

04:44:58.714 --> 04:44:59.949
TIME TO INVESTIGATE A CRIME

04:45:00.016 --> 04:45:01.250
THAT COULD LEAD TO THE SOLVING

04:45:01.317 --> 04:45:03.853
OF OTHER CRIMES IN A DATABASE

04:45:03.920 --> 04:45:07.523
THAT ARE UP. BECAUSE THEY CHOSE

04:45:07.590 --> 04:45:10.693
NOT STERN. MMHM OKAY THANK YOU

04:45:10.760 --> 04:45:24.040

CAMPUS CONSOLIDATION. COULD

04:45:31.280 --> 04:45:32.982
SOMEONE SPEAK TO THAT AND

04:45:33.049 --> 04:45:34.917
EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE

04:45:34.984 --> 04:45:36.719
WITH THE TIME LINE WOULD BE

04:45:36.786 --> 04:45:40.323
AND- AND THE IMPACT ON ON ON

CONSOLIDATION OF WE'RE LOOKING

04:45:55.938 --> 04:45:58.007
AT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT

04:45:58.074 --> 04:46:00.443
IS THAT IS BEING WORKED ON

04:46:00.510 --> 04:46:04.247

AS THE COST OF LIVING. SO THE

04:47:43.379 --> 04:47:44.714
RICHMOND STAFF WILL BE

04:47:44.780 --> 04:47:47.450
RELOCATED WITH CELERY AND WE'VE

WITH DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL

04:48:22.318 --> 04:48:25.087

04:48:25.154 --> 04:48:26.889
IS NEAR THE SACRAMENTO STATE

04:48:26.956 --> 04:48:30.960
CAMPUS BUT THOSE ARE STILL IN

04:48:31.027 --> 04:48:34.363
THE PRELIMINARY PLANNING BASIS.

04:48:34.430 --> 04:48:37.433
AND DID YOU THINK ABOUT- DOING

04:48:37.500 --> 04:48:39.802
THE- CONSOLIDATING THE

04:48:39.869 --> 04:48:41.370

DID- MADAM CHAIR WE LOOKED AT

04:48:49.011 --> 04:48:50.846
SEVERAL DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND

04:48:50.913 --> 04:48:53.182
HOLDING A RICHMOND CAMPUS IS

04:48:53.249 --> 04:48:54.784
ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT HAS

04:48:54.850 --> 04:48:57.386
BEEN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR US

04:48:57.453 --> 04:48:59.689
BECAUSE YEAR BY YEAR THE COSTS

04:48:59.755 --> 04:49:01.424
RELATED TO THE LEAST ABOUT

04:49:01.490 --> 04:49:03.592
PROPERTY. ARE ARE VERY

04:49:03.659 --> 04:49:06.095
EXPENSIVE AND ONE OF THE THINGS

04:49:06.162 --> 04:49:07.697
THAT WE ALSO LOOKED AT HIS THE

04:49:07.763 --> 04:49:10.599
STATE BEING ONE OF THE LESS

04:49:10.666 --> 04:49:12.168
COMPETITIVE SALARIES IN THE

FORENSICS IN THE BAY AREA WERE-

04:49:16.806 --> 04:49:18.941
LOCALS THAT ATE A LOT MORE FOR

04:49:19.008 --> 04:49:21.110
THE FRENCH SCIENTISTS. THE COST

04:49:21.177 --> 04:49:23.079
OF LIVING IS HIGHER AND SO IT

04:49:23.145 --> 04:49:24.513
WAS CONTRARY TO OUR GOAL OF

04:49:24.580 --> 04:49:25.948
ACTUALLY BRINGING ALL OF THOSE

04:49:26.015 --> 04:49:27.650
THINGS TOGETHER INCLUDING THE
