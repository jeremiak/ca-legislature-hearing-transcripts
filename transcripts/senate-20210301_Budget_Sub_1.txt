IN TODAY'S HEARING. WE'LL REVIEW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS REGARDING. CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND BEFORE WE BEGIN ARE THERE ANY OPENING COMMENTS SENATOR MEANT. YES THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR APPEARING TODAY A FEW WEEKS BACK I RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD RESTORED ONLY THREE PERCENT. OF THE TEN PER CENT CARD FROM FUNDING FOR THE UC'S AND CSU'S LAST YEAR I EVEN AS OUR STATE UNIVERSITIES HAVE FACED INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES FROM THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SOMETHING CLEARLY HEARTENED TO SEE THIS PROPOSAL WHICH PROVIDES A FULL RESTORATION LAST YEAR'S BUDGET CUTS AND ALSO SUPPORT OTHER IMPORTANT PRIORITIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION I WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR NEWTON APARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR RESPONDING POSITIVELY DARK CONCERNS. THE DEAL STRUCK BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP TO FULLY RSTORE FINDING THE U. SEASONS YES USE IS AN IMPORTANT VESTMENT IN OUR STATE'S FUTURE PROSPERITY AND SUCCESS. OUR CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IS THE CROWN JEWEL OF HIGHER PUBLIC AND IN THIS COUNTRY. FOR OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS UC AND CSU HAVE PROVIDED AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY PUBLIC EDUCATION CALIFORNIANS. AND THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL FOR OUR STATE SUCCESS NOT ONLY BY EDUCATING MANY GENERATIONS OF OUR LEADERS IN GOVERNMENT BUSINESS SCIENCE LONG THE ARTS. BUT ALSO BY INVESTING IN RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN SO CRUCIAL TO OUR STATE'S ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND RESEARCH. WHETHER IN THE FORM OF CORE FUNDING FOR UC'S FOR STUDENT SUPPORT FOR PROTECT PARTICULAR PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE UC AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES ARE YOU SEE PRIME. OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR FUTURE AND THEY WILL PAY THEMSELVES OFF OVER MANY TIMES. I LOOK FORTY HEARING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION YOU SEE L. A. O. AND OTHERS TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MAN WE APPRECIATE THOSE OPENING COMMENTS- WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO AND I NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT CENTER ROAD SHOW BOTH HAD NO OPENING COMMENTS I'M NOT PASSING HER OVER- AND WILL MOVE TO ISSUE ONE. WHICH IS THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM WITH US TODAY. IS CATHY BOOTH FROM WEST DEAD CHRIS FERGUSON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PAUL STEEN HOUSE AND FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE KNOW THERE ARE ALSO OTHER PEOPLE ONE RESERVE. FROM THOSE PLACES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WE DID AT OUR- TABLE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL SHEET FROM THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM PLANNING UPDATE. WITH THAT WILL GO IN THE ORDER IN WHICH I INTRODUCED PEOPLE WILL BEGIN WITH KATHY BOTH OF WEST AND WELCOME TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN THIS PLANNING PROCESS. SO WHEN WE STARTED OUT SIXTEEN MONTHS AGO WE HAD WANTED TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WAS DEEPLY PARTICIPATORY AND DESPITE THE CHALLENGES THE PANDEMIC WE'VE HAD MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING PROCESS REPRESENTING SIXTEEN DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES. INCLUDING EDUCATION HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICE AND WORKFORCE RELATED ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY REPRESENTING THE INTENDED USERS OF THE DATA SYSTEM. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS STRIKING TO ME IS THAT EVERYBODY COULD HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE PANDEMIC TO STEP BACK FROM THE PLANNING BECAUSE THEY WERE ON THE FRONT LINES. BUT INSTEAD EVERYBODY REALLY DOUBLE DOWN BECAUSE THEY SAW THE STATUS SYSTEM AS PROVIDING WHAT THEY REALLY NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER. OF AS THEY'RE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET MORE PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE IN THE REPORT THAT YOU RECEIVED IN DECEMBER REALLY REPRESENT THE BEST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW TO LINK DATA AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY NEED IT TO INFORM DECISION MAKING. WE HEARD THAT NOT ONLY FROM NTIONAL AND STATE EXPERTS BUT ALSO FROM PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WE'RE ABLE TO DO AN OUTREACH CAMPAIGN IN THE FALL THAT REACH MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE. OF THE IDEAS THAT WERE PUT FORWARD FROM THE WORKGROUP. THAT REPORT THAT YOU ALL RECEIVED IN DECEMBER IS ACTUALLY VERY COMPREHENSIVELY COVERED ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WAS ASKED FOR US. IN THE ORIGINAL AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION AND MOST OF THE WORK THAT REMAINS IN THE PLANNING- UNTIL THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR IS GOING O BE FOCUSED ON TECHNICAL DETAILS LIKE DATA DEFINITIONS. LEGAL FORMS- SECURITY PAPERWORK THAT THAT THE ALL THOSE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE FULLY KEPT PRIVATE FOR INDIVIDUALS- AND SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT DATA SYSTEM. THE OTHER THING HAPPENING THIS SPRING WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT IS FOR DOING WORK AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES AND MESSAGING THAT'LL MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION. HAVING GOTTEN SO FAR THE WORK GROUP IS RECOMMENDING A PROOF OF CONCEPT THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO TEST OUT SOME OF THOSE COMPLEX TECHNICAL AND PRIVACY PROTOCOLS THE- BEEN DEVELOPED. BY THE GROUP. TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS WELL WHICH WILL HELP THE SPEED THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS STARTING NEXT SUMMER- IF HE'S ABLE TO GO FOR IT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WOULD ALSO BE UPDATING SOME CORE SYSTEMS. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DELIVER SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE THE DASHBOARD SHOWING. K. TWELVE TO POST SECONDARY OUTCOMES FASTER THAN ONE YEAR- FINALLY I WANT TO SHARE THAT THE TRAILER BILL AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. FULLY REFLECT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORK GROUPS THE REALLY HAVE A CUT OFF. PACKAGE LOOK AT IT COME. FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WILL HOLD ALL QUESTIONS TILL WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL THREE PANELISTS NEXT WILL GO TO CHRIS FERGUSON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THURMOND CHRIS FERGUSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES. A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT OF WHICH THREE MILLION IT'S ONE TIME. TO SUPPORT THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM THIS REFLECTS THE ESTABLISHMENT. OF THE OFFICE OF CRADLE TO CAREER DATA WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S. OR WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY- THIS ALSO REPRESENTS FUNDING WAR. SOFTWARE AND TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION. ADDITIONALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES PROPOSE. AN ONGOING THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT TO SUPPORT THE- COLLEGE AND CAREER GUIDANCE INITIATIVE WHICH IS ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE DATA SYSTEM. ALL THAT THE ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS PUT FORWARD BY THE- CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM WORK GROUP. AND VERY SPECIFICALLY I THINK WITHIN THAT LANGUAGE APPEARS TO HAVE WHICH IS THE OFFICE OF THE STAMP WHICH IS THE- FUNCTIONS OF THE GOALS OF THE SYSTEM. AS WELL AS A DISCOUNT WHICH IS THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. OF FOR THE PROPOSED ON. OFFICE AND A GOVERNING BOARD THAT WOULD OVERSEE THE DATA SYSTEM- IT'S VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND IT DOES ALIGN VERY CLOSELY WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS. OF THE WORKGROUP. I WITH THAT I WILL LUCK CONCLUDE MY REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THEN WILL MOVE TO POSTING HOUSING OF. THE LA O'S OFFICE. IT MORE. CARE LAYER. MEMBERS POLICY HOUSING WITH THE ANALYSTS ARE. FIRST I THINK MS BOOTH AND HER TEAM SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR LEADING THE WORKING PROCESS MONTH AFTER MONTH THROUGH. IN PERSON AND VIRTUAL MEETINGS THEY FACILITATED MANY DISCUSSIONS ARE PRODUCED REPORT THAT OUR OFFICE SEES IS A GOOD STARTING POINT. FOR THE LEGISLATURE AS IT BEGINS TO WEIGH AND THE MANY PARTICIPANTS ON VARIOUS COMMITTEES AND WORKGROUPS ITSELF ALL SHE SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THE TIME THEY- PUT TOWARDTHIS EFFORT AND THOUGHTFUL CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD THE PLANNING ACTIVITIES. ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL TO CREATE AN INTEGRATED LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM OR CALIFORNIA IS IN LINE WITH A LONG STANDING PRIORITY SYSTEM COULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE MORE HOLISTIC VIEW OF THE STATE'S EDUCATION SYSTEM ALLOW POLICY MAKERS. TO MAKE MORE INFORMED BUDGET POLICY DECISIONS CAN ALSO BE USEFUL TOOL FOR EDUCATORS. WE HAVE SEVERAL HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS IS LOOK WELL AS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AS IT. REVIEWS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS BEGINS AT RISK REVIEWING PROCESS. FIRST THE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM CURRENTLY IS NOT BEING PLANNED FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE OR POWER. WHICH IS THE STATE'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS SO THE POWER PROCESS HAS MULTIPLE STAGES EACH STAGE REQUIRES DEPARTMENTS TO CONDUCT SPECIFIC PLANNING RELATED ANALYSES SUBMIT IT SO SHE DID PLANNING DOCUMENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. AND COLLECTIVELY THE PLANNING DOCUMENTS FROM THE STAGES CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTING A PROPOSED I. T. PROJECT. INCLUDING THE COSTS ESTIMATED COSTS. ADMINISTRATION IS INDICATED IT'S THEIR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THIS CRADLE TO CAREER LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM WILL USE THE POWER PROCESS BUT IT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT WHEN THAT WILL START. IN ADDITION IT'S NOT CLEAR AT THIS TIME WHETHER THERE WILL BE INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT AND INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF THE PROJECT WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR STATE IT PROJECTS ME SERVICES HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE MINISTRATION AND IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST. SO OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS TO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO CLARIFY WHEN IT IT TENDS TO BEGIN USING THE POWER PROCESS FOR THIS PROJECT AND COMMIT TO PROJECT OVERSIGHT. GIVEN THE STATE'S MIXED RECORD WITH I. T. PROJECTS. R. FOR. I THINK THE MINUTE HE CRITICIZED THE STATE'S ATTORNEY PROJECTS THERE WAS A MEDIA RETRIBUTION. SEVEN YEARS ALSO SPECIFY GRINCHES WHICH IS YOU ARE MISTER STEVE HOUSING YOU FROZE FOR ABOUT THE LAST THIRTY MINUTES THE MINUTE YOU SAID THE STATE'S POOR RECORD ON IT PROJECTS YOU FROZE SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WISH TO PICK UP YOUR TESTIMONY FROM THAT POINT. SURE SORRY ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY IN THE OFFICE SO THAT THE WIFE I SHOULD BE GOOD. SO YEAH I GIVEN GIVEN THE- THE MIX RECORD OF WITH I. T. PROJECTS LEGISLATURES SHOULD SPECIFY IN STATUTE WHICH IS THREE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT MR FERGUSON MENTIONED A REQUIREMENT FOR THE PROJECT TO GO THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS STARTING WITH THE PROOF OF CONCEPT THAT MS BOOTH MENTIONED IT ONCE APPROVED TO HAVE INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT SO JUST BEING VERY CLEAR AND LEGISLATION. THAT THE PROJECT IS TO GO THROUGH THE POWER PROCESS AND SUBMIT TO INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION. WE WOULD NOTE THE MINISTRATION CAN ESTIMATE THE PROJECT THROUGH THE POWER PROCESS NOW AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY CAN USE THE PROJECTS FIVE PRIOR PLANNING EFFORTS TO HELP YOU DECIDE WHICH STAGE OF THE PROCESS THE PROJECT SHOULD BEGIN SO. THAT THE PROCESS WOULD NOT HAVE TO THE PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH WITH PLANNING. SO THE SECOND MAJOR- PROJECT RECOMMENDED BY THE WORKGROUP AND PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GUIDANCE INITIATIVE OR C. C. GI. THE CALIFORNIA GOLF COLLEGE GUIDES INITIATIVE HAS A NUMBER OF FEATURES DESIGNED TO HELP STUDENTS PARENTS HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE COUNSELORS. YOUR GENDER ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FOUR DOES A GOOD JOB SUMMARIZING THOSE FEATURES. ANECDOTALLY SEARCHES THROUGH A HANDFUL OF TESTIMONIALS WE KNOW FROM SOME SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND OTHERS WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT C. C. GI. BUT WHILE THE STATE HAS PROVIDED BASE FUNDING TO CCCI FOR YEARS TO DATE THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT PROVIDED ANY FUNDING TO C. C. GI SPECIFICALLY FOR AN INDEPENDENT AND COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION. NOR IS IT REQUIRED THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED C. C. G. I. TO USE ANY OF ITS FUNDS THE CON CONTRACT A CONTRACT FOR SUCH AN EVALUATION. AS A RESULT OF THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT AND HOW WIDELY C. C. G. I.'S VARIOUS FEATURES ARE ACTUALLY USED BY STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS WHICH FEATURES FEATURES OR SERVICES IN PARTICULAR THEY FIND MOST VALUABLE. IF CERTAIN FEATURES ARE NOT WIDELY USED WHY NOT GOOD MODIFICATIONS BEING MADE TO C. C. GI IN THAT CASE SO THAT FEATURES A MORE USEFUL FOR STUDENTS. AND OTHER POTENTIAL USERS. THE END OF ARE YOU WISHING SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF C. C. GI ON STUDENT OUTCOMES FOR EXAMPLE OUR STUDENTS WHO UC C. GI BETTER INFORMED ABOUT COLLEGE ELIGIBILITY IN CAREER OPTIONS. AND THEIR PEERS WHO DON'T USE C. C. GI SO WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE THIS INFORMATION. BEFORE EMBARKING ON A MAJOR AND COSTLY EXPANSION C. C. GI. INSTEAD OF PROVIDING FUNDING FOR C. C. GI EXPANSION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR WE JUST RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR AN EVALUATION. AND IN USE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION TO INFORM THE LEGISLATURE'S NEXT STEPS. WE WOULD NOTE THAT C. C. GI IS A DISCRETE PROJECT SO TAKING TIME FOR AN EVALUATION WOULD NOT AFFECT THE OVERALL TIMELINE FOR THE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM PROJECT. NOW TO MOVE UP TO GOVERNANCE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TWO THIRDS OF THE GOVERNING BOARD WOULD BE MADE UP OF DATA PROVIDERS. WE JUST ONE THIRD CONSISTING OF PUBLIC MEMBERS. DECISIONS MEANWHILE WOULD BE MADE BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE MORE PUBLIC REPRESENTATION ON THE GOVERNING BOARD AS A WAY TO MITIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF DATA PROVIDERS CONTROLLING THE DATA AND USING IT PRIMARILY FOR SEGMENT SPECIFIC INTERESTS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE GIVEN THAT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE GOVERNING BOARD WOULD BE CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING THE DATA REQUEST PROCESS USED BY EDUCATION RESEARCHERS AND OTHERS. HISTORICALLY SOME SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO APPROVE A REQUEST. ENSURE THAT DATA. WE ALSO THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE MORE OF A ROLE IN SELECTING MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNING BOARD UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR WOULD. GET TO SELECT FOR PUBLIC MEMBERS INCLUDING TWO FROM THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM WELL SENATE AND ASSEMBLY COMBINED WOULD GET TO SELECT JUST TO PUBLIC MEMBERS SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF NON DATA PROVIDERS ON THE GOVERNING BOARD SO THEY ARE AT LEAST EQUAL TO IF NOT GREATER THAN. THE NUMBER OF SEATS HELD BY THE-DATA PROVIDERS. WE FURTHER RECOMMEND SPECIFYING. BROUGH TRAILER LANGUAGE OTHER STATUTES THAT THE NON DATA PROVIDING MEMBERS INCLUDE REPRESENTATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS BIPARTISAN REPRESENTATION FROM THE LEGISLATURE. ON THE QUESTION OF WHO SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH BUILDING HOUSING IN OPERATING THE DATA SYSTEM WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S UNREASONABLE FOR A NEW OFFICE WITHIN THE OFFICE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY TO BE THE ONE TO IT KEEP IT TO INCUBATE IN LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. WELCOME BOB DOESN'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE OR EXPERTISE WITH DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING IMPLEMENTING AND DATA SYSTEMS IT IS WORKING TO IMPROVE HOW THE STATE COLLECTS MANAGES AND USES DATA THROUGH ITS STATEWIDE DATA STRATEGY WHICH IS LED BY THE CHIEF DATA OFFICER WITHIN THE BOX SO WE THINK THERE ARE POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE SYNERGIES BETWEEN THAT STATEWIDE EFFORT. AND WHAT'S PROPOSED WITH THE STATUS SYSTEM. THIRTY TWO ADDRESSED OF THE FIRST SUGGESTED QUESTION ON PAGE SIX OF YOUR AGENDA ASKED ABOUT COST. WE THINK THE ESTIMATED ONGOING COSTS OF TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR GOV OPS LIKELY IS TOO LOW FOR WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO DO. IN PARTICULAR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE LIST SOUTH RESPONSIBILITIES AND REQUIRED ACTIVITIES OF GOVERNMENT OF OPS STAFF YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA SO YOU HAVE. CREATING PROCURING MAINTAINING SECURITY NEEDS TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. ALSO CREATING AND MAINTAINING PUBLIC FACING FORMAL AND MULTIPLE DATA TOOL SUPPORTING THE GOVERNING BOARD ADVISORY BOARDS SUPPORTING THE DATA PROVIDERS BEING THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR RESEARCHERS ENSURING LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND IN ALL THESE ACTIVITIES WOULD BE DONE AS PROPOSED BY GOVERNOR WAS JUST TWELVE STAFF WITHIN O BOX. NOW THE WORKING GROUP'S DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY LEGISLATIVE REPORT NOTES THAT OTHER STATES TYPICALLY HAVE BETWEEN ELEVEN AND THIRTEEN STAFF FOR THEIR DATA SYSTEM. YET AS THE WORKGROUP NOTES THAT CALIFORNIA'S CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SSTEM AS PROPOSED LIKELY WOULD BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN THESE OTHER STATES WITH MORE DATA PROVIDERS CONTRIBUTING TO THE SYSTEM MORE TOOLS FOR THE PUBLIC ACCESS. AND NOT TO MENTION THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HAVING TO MANAGE TWO OTHER PROJECTS THE C. C. GI AND HE TRANSFERRED FORTY WHICH IS ALSO RECOMMENDED BUT I TO WORK WITH. AND IN THE GOVERNOR'S- TRAILER BILL. LANGUAGE AS PROPOSED. SO UPDATED. ON ON BECAUSE FOR GOVERNOR. WELL AS DAVID FOR CC IN THE TRANCE ARE EXPECTED IN THE WORK GROUPS APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE PROGRESS REPORT. THE FINAL REPORT IS DUE LEGISLATURE BY A JUNE. THE MINISTRATION HAS INDICATED THAT SHOULD THERE BE A REVISED FUNDING RECOMMENDATION RECOMMENDATION REFLECTED IN THAT REPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD CONSIDER ANY REVISIONS TO ITS- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IS PART OF ME REVISION. SO JUST KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING AMOUNT COULD CHANGE AND YOU COULD SEE. NEW ESTIMATES ON OVERALL PROJECT COSTS. LIKELY THAT WE KNOW WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. LASTLY AS AGENDA IS THE AGENDA NOTES ON PAGES FIVE AND SIXTY MINISTRATION HAS A CURRENT YEAR BUDGET REQUEST TO BEGIN SPENDING SIX MILLION DOLLARS REMAINING FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S ORIGINAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS APPROPRIATION FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. AND THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM AS WELL AS BEGIN EXPANDING AND SCALING CCDI. AND HIRING SOME SOME INITIAL PROJECTS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING A RESPONSE ADMINISTRATION BY APRIL FIFTEENTH ON WHETHER IT CONCURS ARE NOT WITH THE EXPENDITURE OF THESE FUNDS FOR THESE PURPOSES. THAT'S NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA. WE UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION'S DESIRE TO MOVE QUICKLY TO THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE OF THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM BUT GIVEN ALL THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO MAKE ON THE DIRECTION AND SCOPE OF THE DATA SYSTEM. THE UNKNOWNS AT THIS TIME ABOUT ONGOING TOTAL PROJECT COST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE HOLD OFF COMPARING WITH THE CURRENT YEAR EXPENDITURE REQUEST UNTIL AT LEAST AFTER MAY REVISE AND THEN MAKE IT. MORE COHERENT DECISION AT THAT TIME AS PART OF AN OVERALL FUNDING PLAN FOR THEIR CRADLES GROUP DATA SYSTEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FROM. I WAS GONNA ASK- CHRIS FERGUSON OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO RESPOND TO MR STEINHAUSEN BUT- THERE WAS SUCH A LONG LIST OF THINGS. THAT LET'S JUST NOTE THAT HE MADE THOSE COMMENTS AND I WOULD ASK MR FERGUSON IF YOU HAD ANY GENERAL COMMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE L. A. O.'S RECOMMENDATION. YEAH CERTAINLY THANK YOU GOD GOD CHAIR LAYERED UP- I THINK THERE ARE A FEW TENTH CONTACT THE NUMEROUS COMMENTS I THINK THERE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS CERTAINLY OPEN TO THE CONVERSTION REGARDING ITS COVER ITS PROPOSED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE I THINK WE HAVE HEARD THOSE SIMILAR CONCERNS- AND WE ARE OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE CONCERNS. I IT IS ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THERE IS AN APRIL FIRST REPORT THE WILL BE FORTHCOMING FROM. OF THE WORKGROUP THAT COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE REVISED- COST ESTIMATES FOR THE PROJECT. AND IT IS. ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD REVIEW THOSE CALLS I IN LIGHT OF THE MAY REVISION- WE WOULD SAY THOUGH THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE A FEW THINGS FOR EXAMPLE. THE C. C. GI IT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS PROPOSED FOR USE WITHIN THE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR PARENTS AND STUDENTS AT SPECIFICALLY WE THINK THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO THAT ASPECT. OF THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM- ADDITIONALLY I REQUIRE PROVIDED THAT IN THE OUT YEARS RIGHT NOW THE ADMINISTRATION GOES PROJECT SIXTEEN DIVISIONS. ARE STARTING IN THE BUDGET YEAR AS OPPOSED TO TWELVE POSITIONS OR OR IN THE BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE AS OPPOSED TO TWELVE POSITIONS IN THE BUDGET HERE SO THERE. IS A SLIGHT INCREASE PROJECTED IN THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE. IT HOW. WITHIN THE OFFICE- AND I THINK THINK GLOBALLY WE WOULD JUST SAY THAT. WE WANT PROGRESS TO CONTINUE ON THE DATA SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT THAT. MEANS BEGINNING VERY EARLY I OR AT LEAST PARTIALLY DESCRIBE THIS SCHOOL YEAR USING FUNDS THE WERE ALREADY APPROPRIATED INTENDED FOR THIS PURPOSE I IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET- I'LL- CERTAINLY. SEE THE VALUE IN THE SYSTEM WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE THE TREMENDOUS WORKER THAT'S GONE INTO. THE DISCUSSION TODAY- AND WE NO THAT THE SYSTEM HAVE ABOUT NOT FOR. OUR INDUSTRY TO RE. INTERPOL BY AS PER IT WOULD ALSO ON TRIMMING BENEFITS. WERE UP FOR PARENTS AND DROPPED. I SERVICE A LOT OF VALUE IN THE SYSTEM WE WANT TO CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD WITH. THANK YOU AND- I THINK WE WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU WORKED WITH THE L. A- TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AS WELL AS THE ONES WHERE. HE RECOMMENDED THAT YOU WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THEM HARBORONE LAST RELATED QUESTION. ARE ASKING HOW THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET REQUEST IT'S UNDER REVIEW BY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. INTEGRATES WITH OF. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. THAT'S THE FINANCE. DURING THEIR TWO CORE COMPONENTS- ONE. IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT A COMPONENT. WHERE BY WORKING WITH ATTEMPTING. LOOK AT SOME OF THE SOFTWARE PACKAGES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO ENSURE THE THING ON SOFTWARE PACKAGES AND A TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF DATA. BETWEEN EIGHTEEN- IN MEETINGS SO THERE'S A- I THINK IT'S THREE SPECIFIC ENTITIES THAT HAVE AGREED TO PILOT CERTAIN DATA SETS THAT THEY HAVE TO SEE THAT THOSE EXCHANGES CAN OCCUR AND ARE OCCURRING AS INTENDED. TO SUPPORT THE DATA SYSTEM AND THEN THE SECOND COMPONENT PROBABLY THE LARGER COMPONENT IS THERE ARE SOME RESOURCES THAT ARE SET ASIDE FOR. FUTURE SUPPORT OF THE PROGRAM FOR ONE TIME COSTS THAT WOULD OCCUR AND ALSO TO SUPPORT SOME TECHNICAL- REVISIONS TO EXISTING SYSTEMS TO HELP FACILITATE A COMPATIBILITY WITH THE DATA EXCHANGES SO A THERE WOULD BE SOME SUPPORT FOR. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE IN THE CALVET SYSTEM AS WELL AND SOME SUPPORT FOR BEGINNING TO EXPAND- C. C. G. I. IN JUNE THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO SERVE MORE US SCHOOLS STUDENTS. AND PARENTS. OKAY THANK YOU BUT FROM- THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE. OUR CHAU. I DO HAVE A QUESTION- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I AM A FRESHMAN SENATOR I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO THE COST OF THE PROGRAM IS THAT PRETTY STANDARD IN IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING OR SYSTEMS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED IT. WITHIN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. MINISTER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARAMBULA I'M GOING TO THIS ONE. PROBABLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OKAY LET'S ADDRESS THAT QUESTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SURE SO THE COST OF WE HAVE FOR THIS SYSTEM ARE PRIMARILY- I ONE THE OPERATIONAL ASPECTS AND TO THE ACTUAL SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT SO WITHIN THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT OR THE ACQUISITION LARGELY OF SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS THAT EXIST TODAY- THAT WE WOULD BE ACQUIRING. SHOULD THEN IMPLEMENT AND USE FOR THE DATA EXCHANGES BETWEEN THAT THE SYSTEM IN THE SEGMENTS AND THE ENTITIES PARTICIPATING IN THE SYSTEM- WE THINK. THAT BECAUSE THAT THE COSTS ARE LARGELY SOFTWARE DRIVEN AND THEN BUILDING OUT THE TOOLS TO ENABLE- INDIVIDUALS TO ACCESS THAT DATA. WE THE COST FOR OUR- IN LINE WITH WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT WE WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING. I'M IN THE BACK PROBLEMS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- YOU KNOW INITIALLY- SO CERTAINLY I THINK WE SEE THAT- COSTS- AS BEING. IN LINE WITH WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT- BASED ON THE ESTIMATES THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE DATA SYSTEM AND HOW WE ARE FACILITATING THE EXCHANGES OF DATA. DID THAT PERFECTLY YEAH OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THANKS TO OUR PANELISTS THAT COMPLETES OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT ISSUE NUMBER ONE. AND WE WILL NOT THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THERE AND WE WILL NOT THEM AS WE HAD TO THE MAIN REVISED. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE MAIN EVENT WHICH IS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE- OF THROUGH SEVEN ISSUES ARE TWO THROUGH SEVEN AND WITH CENTURY HAVE THE SAME PANELISTS FOR ALL OF THEM- BRIAN RUTLEDGE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REBEKAH KIRK FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAY JEFF BURTON AND FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA JASON CONSTANT D'EUROS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND THE ONLY VARIATION IS THAT MS CLARK WILL NOT BE INVOLVED IN ISSUE SIX BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WILL BE THE SAME PANEL SO WE'LL MOVE OF THE ITEM TO WHICH IS THE BASE BUDGET INCREASE AND PROBABLY THE OVERVIEW OF BUDGETARY WAY FOR UC AND WILL BEGIN WITH BRIAN RUTLEDGE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. MORNING MY COLLEAGUE REBECCA KIRK IS GONNA START US OFF AND THEN I'LL FINISH US OUT HERE THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR SHARE THANK YEAR REBEKAH CURFEW PARTNER FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A 3% INCREASE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED THREE POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND ONGOING COMPRISED OF NINETY FIVE MILLION FOUR UC CAMPUSES. AND EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION BETWEEN THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THE UC PASSED A ROLL ACCOUNTING KIND KEEPING AND HUMAN RESOURCES DEFENSE AND THE UC DIVISION. OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION PART OF THE EARLY ACTION AGREEMENT RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A FINANCE LETTER WAS ISSUED TO PROVIDE YOU SEE THREE HUNDRED TWO POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND ONGOING. YOU SEE HAVING COURAGE TO USE THESE RESOURCES. FIVE SUPPORT FOR CAMPUS OF CHANGING OPERATIONAL AND PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS. IN TOTAL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE EARLY ACTION AGREEMENT WOULD PROVIDE YOU SPEAK WITH FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND ONGOING. BUDGET FEEDS THE AMOUNT OF UC'S BASED GENERAL FUND REDUCTION IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE JACQUI. IN ADDITION TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS CONTINGENT UPON IT THAT I'VE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITY. COLLEAGUE BRIAN RUTLEDGE WILL OUTLINE THE EXPECTATIONS. GOOD MORNING BRIAN ROSE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO. THE OVERALL HIGHER EDUCATION AGENDA FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S IS FOCUSED ON EQUITY IN ACCESS. SO WITH OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. PROPOSE BASED AUGMENTATION WORSE WERE EXPECTED WORK PROVIDING FIVE EXPECTATIONS THAT COME WITH THAT THE FIRST IS THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CREATED A DETAILED AND ACTIONABLE EQUITY PLAN BY JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE PLAN WOULD DETAIL HOW THE UC WILL. REDUCE EQUITY GAPS BY TWENTY PERCENTAGE POINTS. ANNUALLY AND ACHIEVE FULLY CLOSING THOSE EQUITY GAPS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THIS WOULD BE THE LANGUAGE WE HAVE. REQUIRES ALIGNING TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ON DEFINING AND HAVING METRICS FOR THOSE EQUITY GAPS. THE SECOND MAJOR EXPECTATION IS THAT THE UC. INCREASE IT ONLINE CAPACITY. ABOVE THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ACADEMIC YEAR LEVELS BY TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS. SO THAT'S ESSENTIALLY IMPROVE THE ONLINE CAPACITY OF THE PRE COVERT SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE NOW THAT CODE IS HAPPENED AND WE'VE GONE TO ALMOST FULLY ONLINE WANT TO PRESERVE SOME THAT CAPACITY. THE THIRD EXPECTATION IS THAT THE UC. REALLY DIFFERENT LANGUAGE CREATES A NEW TOOL OF MISSIONS PROGRAM. THIS NOODLE MISSIONS PROGRAM WOULD BE A STANDALONE DISTINCTIVE TRANSFER PATHWAY. BUT IT WOULD COMPLEMENT EXISTING TRANSFER PATHWAYS. THE WAY FIRST TIME FRESHMEN WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY TO A CCC WHILE ALSO CON CURRENTLY APPLYING FOR FUTURE ADMISSION TO THE UNIT TO A UC CAMPUS OF THEIR CHOICE. AND BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA. A INCLUDING COMPLETING AN EIGHTY T. OR AT T. LIKE EQUIVALENT THROUGH THE UC SYSTEM IN TWO ACADEMIC YEARS THEY WOULD THEREFORE BE. HAVE GUARANTEED FUTURE ACCESS TO UC CAMPUS. THE GOALS THAT WE SPECIFY FOR THIS DUAL MISSIONS PROGRAM INCLUDE TO INCREASE ACCESS FOR PERSONS AFFECTED UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS. STUDENTS FACING GEOGRAPHICAL CONSTRAINTS ARE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. TO INCREASE UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATION RATES TO DO DECREASE STUDENT COSTS TO IMPROVE TRANSFER PATHWAYS OVERALL THROUGH THE STATE AND TO INCREASE PREDICTABILITY FOR STUDENTS BUT ALSO FOR INSTITUTIONS AND SEE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS COME ONE SIX AGREEMENTS ARE IN PLACE. ALSO CRITICAL HERE IS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON ACCESS AND EQUITY COMES THROUGH IN THE DUAL MISSIONS PROGRAM BECAUSE WE SPECIFY THAT YO SEE SHALL TRY TO ROUGHLY A MINUTE HALF OF UC ELIGIBLE STUDENTS THROUGH THIS NEW. ADMISSIONS PROGRAMS BUT ALSO HALF THAT OUR- FIRST TIME FRESHMEN THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE UC ELIGIBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE THIS IS ESSENTIALLY AN ALTERNATIVE WAY. TO ADDRESS UNDERREPRESENTED AND DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. THE FOR THE EXPECTATION IS THAT TUITION FOR RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES REMAINED FLAT- THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ACADEMIC YEAR- THE FIFTH IS THAT. YOU SEE WORK TO BETTER ALIGN STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES WITH WORKFORCE AND INDUSTRY NEEDS SO WITH THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR- OUR PRESENTATION OF THE BASE AUGMENTATION AND EXPECTATIONS AND WE'RE OPEN FOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I KNOW AS WITH THE PREVIOUS PANEL WILL DO QUESTIONS WHEN OUR- EVERY PANELIST IS PRESENTED WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO SEE JEFF BURTON AND FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING SURELY ARE TO MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND STAY OVER CANADA AND I'M REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- GRATEFUL FOR THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND THE GOVERNOR FULLY RESTORED UNIVERSITIES BASED BUDGET REDUCTIONS STARTING JULY FIRST. RECEIVING THESE FUNDS BACK IS CRITICAL FOR AVOIDING STEEP REDUCTIONS THE CAMPUS SERVICES. THE RESTORATION OF THE UNIVERSITY SPACE BUGET ALLOWS US TO MOVE AWAY FROM CRISIS MANAGEMENT WHICH COULD HAVE MEANT HUNDREDS OF LAYOFFS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. THIS RESTORATION GETS YOU SEE BACK TO THE SAME LEVEL OF FUNDING AS IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR SCHOOL YEAR. NOW WE CAN INSTEAD DISCUSS HOW DO UNIVERSITIES POPULATIONS CAN BE SUPPORTED AND EVEN ENHANCE TO ALLOW OUR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF TO THRIVE AND USE THEIR SKILLS TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION CALIFORNIA AND THE- UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC REFLECTS OUR UNIQUE ROLE. OF RESEARCH EDUCATION AND PUBLIC SERVICE IN THE STATE OF WITH THINGS INCLUDING- TREATING PATIENTS PROVIDING COVER TESTING FOR THE COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING OUR CAMPUSES I'M PROVIDING REMOTE INSTRUCTION. EVEN THOUGH THE INITIAL MONTHS OF CODE NINETEEN WERE ECONOMICALLY STRAINING ON YOU SEE OUR LEADERSHIP EXPRESSED A STRONG DESIRE TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE EMPLOYEES WHILE PRESERVING AND EVEN STRENGTHENING OUR EDUCATION AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. FROM THE START OF THE PANDEMIC TO JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THERE WERE NO COVERAGE. RELATED LAYOFFS AT UNIVERSITY. J. UNIVERSITIES REAL BECAUSE AMOUNT TO OVER THREE ONE. THE FEDERAL FUNDING YOU SEE HAS RECEIVED FROM THE TO FEDERAL RELIEF BILLS PASSED SO FAR PROVIDE TO SPEAK WITH ONE POINT FIVE BILLION OR ABOUT HALF OF THE COST TO DATE. IS SIGNIFICANT COST MEANS THAT THE UNIVERSITY FACES BREAK FINANCIAL PRESSURES AND MAKES THE BASE BUDGET RESTORATION CRITICAL IN AVOIDING FUTURE LAYOFFS. WE'RE ALSO VERY APPRECIATIVE OF GOVERNOR NEW SINCE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL WHICH PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS UC STUDENTS. WE WILL DISCUSS SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE LATER IN THE HEARING BUT RIGHT NOW ALL FOCUS ON THE BASE BUDGET GROWTH FUNDS. REVERTED CALIFORNIA NEEDS HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION. THIS IS STAIN CORE OPERATIONS IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. IS FUNDS ARE NEEDED TO PAY COSTS THAT COME FROM BEING A PEOPLE DRIVEN INSTITUTION. BUT JUST A MANDATORY COMPENSATION INCREASES TO REPRESENT LABOR ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT COSTS AND HEALTHCARE COST INCREASES. THE NEW FUNDING IS NOT RECEIVED UNIVERSITY WILL NEED TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO COVER THESE COSTS. SUCH AS CUTTING EXISTING SERVICES. EVERVERSE BUDGET INCLUDES HUNDRED FOUR MILLION IN NEW FUNDING FOR CORE OPERATION INCREASES AND WE'RE REQUESTING YOUR APPROVAL OF THESE BONDS. ARE TIED TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF POLICY GOALS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN YOUR AGENDA AND BY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST NOW- TO GET OVER USED THE UNIVERSITY SHARES THE- STATE'S GOALS OF ACCESS AND INCLUSION. WE DO HAVE REQUEST REGARDING TWO OF THESE PROPOSED POLICY CHANGES. ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S OUTLINED GOALS IS TO REDUCE GRADUATION GAPS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM ALREADY HAS A STRONG GRADUATION RATE OF FOR SIX YEARS. AN 89% OR TRANSPARENT TRENDS AFTER FOUR YEARS. BUILT WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE UC REGENTS ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO EQUITY AND INCLUSION IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. AND WITH THESE GOALS IN MIND APPROVED THE FRAMEWORK TWENTY THIRTY PLAN. THIS PLAN SEEKS TO CLOSE GRADUATION EQUITY GAPS AT UC BY TWENTY THIRTY THE FIRST YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PLAN WAS ESTIMATED AT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. WE'RE IN THIS ASPECT UNDERTAKE THE WORK OF CLOSING GRADUATION EQUITY GAPS BUT CANNOT. DO SO WITHOUT NEW RESOURCES. GO OUR EFFORTS OF CLOSE GRADUATE GAPS HAVE NOT THE BIGGEST FUNDED WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE 20% INCREASING GRADUATION RATES BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. I REQUEST THAT FOR YOU SEE WE BOTH RECEIVE NEW FUNDING FOR THIS EFFORT AND THE TIMELINE BE ADJUSTED BACK TO TWENTY THIRTY. ANOTHER POLICY GOAL PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IS TO INCREASE YOUR ONLINE COURSES BY 10% OVER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY STUDYING DEFECTIVE LESSEN CHALLENGES OF REMOTE INSTRUCTION. INITIAL INDICATORS ARE THAT REMOTE INSTRUCTION HAS NOT BEEN EQUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR ALL STUDENTS. WE REQUEST TIME TO COMPLETE OUR ANALYSIS BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SHIFTING TOWARDS ONLINE EDUCATION. THE GOVERNOR'S LANGUAGE ESTABLISHES PROVIDING NEW FUNDING FOR COURSES WHICH WOULD MEAN NOT ADDING TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COURSES OFFERED BY SHIFTING THE EXISTING COURSES THE ONLINE PEDAGOGY. THAT HAVING BEEN SAID WE DO SEE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASING ONLINE COURSE OFFERINGS AS A WAY TO SEARCH STUDENTS- SUCH AS DURING SUMMER WHEN STUDENTS ARE RETURNING HOME WITH THEIR PARENTS OR TRAVELING OR DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO PICK AN INTERNSHIP AT ANOTHER LOCATION. WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKING ACADEMIC PROGRESS. WELL WE SEE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE EXPANSION OF ONLINE EDUCATION WE MUST REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE NOT ADOPT THE SPECIFIC TARGET TIME. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS A UNIQUE MISSION INCOME- IN CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS WITH RESEARCH INCORPORATED WITH EDUCATION AND PUBLIC SERVICE. WE EDUCATE OVER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS WE EMPLOY NEARLY HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND FACULTY AND STAFF. OF WE CONTRIBUTE EIGHTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY ANNUALLY. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY BRING IN OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL RESEARCH GRANT FUNDS TO CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR THAT'S MORE THAN THEIR SALARIES- AND THEY PRODUCE FOR INVENTIONS THAT DATE THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA'S KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY. AND FUEL THE STATE'S GROWTH IS A WORLD INNOVATION LEADER YOU SEE STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM THE CUTTING EDGE INSIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY BEING TAUGHT BY WORLD CLASS FACULTY. WE ARE REQUESTING THAT IN ADDITION TO THE RESTORATION AND GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YOU PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY WITH EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND ONGOING FUNDING FOR CAMPUS OR OPERATION COST. AND EQUITY EFFORTS. TO CLOSE THE GRADUATION CAP THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. ADDRESSING CONSTANT TORRES LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THIS ISSUE REALLY HAS TWO COMPONENTS TO IT THE FIRST COMPONENT IS HOW MUCH BASED FUNDING TO SUPPORT TO PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY. IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND THE SECOND ISSUE IS WHAT EXPECTATIONS TO ATTACH THAT WE SUPPORT WELL TOUCH ON EACH COMPONENT. ON THE FIRST ISSUE OF HOW MUCH BASED SUPPORT BY THE UNIVERSITY I'M ALWAYS TO BE FEBRUARY AGREEMENT IN PLACE WHICH RESTORES THE REDUCTIONS- ENACTED AND IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. THE ISSUE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IS WHETHER IT WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR MODIFICATION I'M BEYOND THIS FEBRUARY GREENLAND'S. ON THE ONE HAND- AS- ARE YOU SEE NOTED IN TESTIMONY ON THE UNIVERSITY IS FACING ON SOME COST PRESSURES IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SUCH THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE WORK WERE INTERESTED IN RETURNING TO SERVICE LEVELS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. SOME AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING COULD POTENTIALLY BE WARRANTED. ON THE OTHER HAND AS WE'VE NOTED AND MANY OTHER- HEARING BEFORE YOU THE STATE GENERAL FUND. ON THIS PROJECTED TO HAVE DEFICITS IN THE OUT YEARS AND- HAS SOMEWHAT LIMITED CAPACITY. FOR SUPPORTING MORE ONGOING PROPOSALS. SO THESE COMPETING FACTORS IN MIND WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU REVISIT THIS ISSUE IN NAY REVISION- WE GET MORE INFORMATION ON THE STATE'S BUDGET CONDITION. AFTER THE SECOND COMPONENT WHAT EXPECTATIONS TO ATTACH TO THE BASE SUPPORT FOR YOU SEE. ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF EACH OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EXPECTATIONS STARTS ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR GENDER AND ARE YOU ACTUALLY HEARD A LOT OF OUR COMMENTS ALREADY ON IN YOUR CSU HEARING ARM IF YOU MIGHT RECALL WE RECOMMEND SOME. MODIFICATIONS TO THE- EXPECTATION FOR EQUITY PLANS WE RECOMMEND A MORE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION. TO THE EXPECTATION FROM MINE EDUCATION EFFECTIVELY- ELIMINATING THEM PROPOSED TEN PERCENT. INCREASE IN HORSES AND INSTEADGETTING SOME MORE INFORMATION TO A REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SAKE OF TIME I KNOW YOU HAVE A BUSY AGENDA I'LL DEFER TO THAT CUBAN YOU WOULD LIKE. FURTHER DETAILS ON THAT. WHY PROPOSAL IT BECAME I WANTED TO. I'LL PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON IS THE DOOR EXPECTATIONS YOU MIGHT RECALL IN OUR CSU HEARING THAT WE NOTED THAT THE TRAILER BILL HAD JUST BEEN RELEASED AND WE WERE STILL AT THE MOMENT BUT WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL. AND IN OUR ESTIMATION OF THAT THE TRAILER BILL STILL LEAVES MANY CRITICAL DETAILS I'M ON ANSWERED FOR EXAMPLE IT'S STILL UNCLEAR HOW MANY STUDENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEW ADMISSION POLICY ALSO UNCLEAR. EXACTLY WHICH TYPES OF STUDENTS MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE IMMIGRATION POLICY SO IT'S HARD TO GAUGE THE POTENTIAL EQUITY IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSAL IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR HOW THE PROPOSAL WOULD INTERACT WITH ON SOME OF UC'S EXISTING PATHWAYS FOR EXAMPLE- UC CAMPUSES ALREADY OFFER A TRANSFER ADMISSION GUARANTEES TO CERTAIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. WHEN THIS PROPOSAL ELIMINATE THIS PATHWAY OR WORK IN TANDEM WITH THAT THESE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS TO AT THE MOMENT AND WITHOUT THIS INFO I'M IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER THE DEMOLITION POLICY WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE TRANSFER PROCESS OVERALL OR DO WE JUST SIMPLY ADD TO THE COMPLEXITY BY JUST ADDING ANOTHER PATHWAY AVAILABLE. TO HAVE A CERTAIN PORTION OF STUDENTS. I THINK YOU GUYS ARE COMMON BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANYTHING AND HE MAY. THANK YOU MUCH TO ALL THE PANELISTS. LET ME BEGIN WITH COUPLE OF. AND MAYBE STICKING WITH THE L. A. L. JUST ONE OFF. OF STICKING WITH THE L. A. O. IF YOU COULD HELP ME BRIEFLY JUST WITH THE LINEAR- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BUDGET BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S REFERRED TO ONE PIECE OF IT. IS IT BASICALLY. THE YEAR PRE COVERED WAS AT A CERTAIN LEVEL THE FIRST BUDGET TOOK IT DOWN DRAMATICALLY THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET RESTORED AT PARKWAY THE FEBRUARY AGREEMENT RESTORES IT BACK TO THE LEVEL OF WHERE WAS PRIOR TO COVERED AND THERE'S A FEDERAL. OUR OUR STIMULUS MONEY THAT'S BEEN RECEIVED BY UC THE WORD IS IT ACTUALLY STAND IS IT IS A AT THE SAME PLACE WITH NO COST OF LIVING INCREASE SINCE PRIOR TO COVERED OR IS IT RESTORED TO THE SAME PLACE PLUS THE COST OF LIVING INCREASE PLUS THE FEDERAL STIMULUS. YEAH THAT WAS THAT WAS A VERY ACCURATE SUMMARY OF ALL THE DIFFERENT PACKAGES BEFORE YOU AND I APPRECIATE IT IS A LITTLE HARD TO TRACK ALL THE DIFFERENT PACKAGES- SO YOU'RE CORRECTED THAT- THE- BUDGET LAST YEAR ENACTED SOME REDUCTIONS TO UC'S. BASED GENERAL FUND SUPPORT- ACCORDING TO LEGISLATIVE STAFF BE SEPARATE GRAHAM AND THAT'S FAR. HAS EFFECTIVELY RESTORES THESE REDUCTIONS SO UC'S BASED SUPPORT WILL BE RETURNED. TO THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT IT HAD IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY SO PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. AND THAT'S WITH NO GOOD NO COLA- MARIN- STANDING AS THE AS THE AGREEMENT SO FAR IT'S JUST RESTORATION LOCAL LAW NOW THE- ADMINISTRATION IF YOU RECALL IN JANUARY. DID PROPOSE- CERTAIN AUGMENTATIONS AND THE ADMINISTRATION INDICATES THAT THESE AUGMENTATIONS ARE STILL ON THE TABLE SO IF YOU GET IT AT- LEGISLATURE WATER WITHOUT THESE AUGMENTATIONS ON TOP OF- THE RESTORATION THERE WOULD BE A COLA FOR THE FOR YOU SEE IN THE BUDGET YEAR- JUST LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS YOU WOULD BE SOMEWHERE AROUND THREE PERCENT- OF- OF A COAL OUT OF ABOVE PRE CANDIDATE GLOBALES QUE TEM LET ME YEAH LET ME ASK THE UC REPRESENTATIVE A QUESTION HOW DOES THISSINCE THE STIMULUS MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO YOU HOW DID THE STIMULUS MONEY RELATE. TO ALL THIS. A WHAT CITY FOR. THE STIMULUS MONEY WAS USED ON CAMPUSES- TO HELP COVER LOSSES FROM KOBE NINETEEN THE NEXT ORDINARY COSTS THAT THE CAMPUS IS CHAD- OUR CAMPUSES HE DATE HAVE HAD ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF LOSSES FROM KOBE- THAT INCLUDES DIRECT EXPENDITURES AND LOST REVENUES AND OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEM HAS HAD ANOTHER- ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN LOSSES DUE TO CODE RED. SO THE FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS HAVE GONE TO- COVERED THOSE- EXTRAORDINARY EXPENDITURES AND HOW MUCH WERE THE FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION COMBINED FOR BOTH OUR CAMPUSES AND THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM SO OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEM HAD ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION AND EXPENDITURES AND RECEIVED EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION IN CODE STIMULUS FUNDS- THE CAMPUS SAYS RECEIVED ABOUT. THREE HUNDRED NINETY MILLION IN STIMULUS FUNDING AND THE REMAINDER WENT TO STUDENTS- AND SOMEONE TO OUR NATIONAL LABORATORIES AND IF I DID THE MATH OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD OBVIOUSLY THE STIMULUS FUNDS DID NOT MAKE UP THE INITIAL LOSS THAT YOU SAID YOU'D HAVE BOTH OF THE HOSPITALS AND UC FROM COVERED. HOW DOES CORRECT HOUSE REST. OF IT MADE UP- WELL DO YOU- TO OUT A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR LOAN LAST SUMMER TO HELP US COVER COST- WE TOOK OUT ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LOAN LAST NOVEMBER- TO HELP WITH- LIQUIDITY ON OUR CAMPUSES- WE ARE ALSO USING. FOR OUR CAMPUS CORE OPERATIONS WE HAVE BEEN USING A VARIETY OF. COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES INCLUDING USING RESERVES WE HAD AN ALMOST COMPLETE HIRING FREEZE- WE LIMITED ALL TRAVEL. AND TOOK SOME OTHER- ONE TIME COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES. BUT IN. THE STIMULUS MAKES UP. SOME SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE LOANS AND ALLOWED SET TO BE PAID BACK IS THAT CORRECT. BUT WE ARE STILL HOPING FOR FURTHER FEDERAL STIMULUS AND I MEAN THE EXISTING STIMULUS THAT YOU'RE GETTING SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS TWO THIRDS OF THE REDUCTIONS YOU HAD FROM COVERED IN SOUNDS LIKE THE LOAN. WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE AMOUNT OF REDUCTIONS YOU TAKEN FROM COVERED SO WOULDN'T A STIMULUS ALLOW YOU TO PAY BACK PART OF THE LONG. NOPE BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE. A LOT OF EXTRAORDINARY COSTS ON THE CAMPUSES SO THAT FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS HAVE PROVIDED US WITH ABOUT HALF. OF OUR CODE. AND WENT TO DIRECT WENT TO COVER DIRECT EXPENDITURES WELL LET. ARM ALL OF WHICH WERE STILL BEHIND SIR- WELL NO I GET FROM FROM EVEN WHAT YOU SAID YOU'RE STILL BEHIND BUT I THINK THAT NONE OF THIS WAS SORT OF CLEAR IN OUR MATERIALS AND AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE MAY REVISE IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO HAVE SOME CLARITY ON THIS. SO THAT IF WE WORK CONSIDERING ANYTHING. UP FOR YOU SEE WE HAVE THE FULL CONTEXT FOR. RIGHT I THINK I THINK YOU'RE STOP- IT DO A REALLY GOOD JOB EXPLAINING WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S ACTIONS HAVE BEEN- WITH ALL OUR COVERT LOSSES ARE MANDATORY COURT COSTS GROWTH ARE. FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS COMING IN. UP FOR D. TWENTY TWENTY. HELLO THERE YEAR YOU SEE WAS STILL ARE I KNOW THE STAFF DID A GOOD JOB I. EAT IT BUT IT STILL LOOK LIKE YOU HAD TO PULL UP TO THE TOP TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THE- THE LINEAR- BALLOT SHE WAS THE END SO THAT'S THE THING THAT. WOULD BE NICE TO BE CLEAR ON THIS WEEK WE. HEADED TO- MAY. THE N. I. C. FROM FINANCE JUST BEEN ALL THE WHITE I DON'T KNOW IF YOUHAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR WE JUST TAKE THE NODS FOR- WHAT THEY MEANT TO BE. YEAH I THINK IT'S- TIME WE WILL HAVE. CAN QUICKLY RESPOND TO A UC RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT IMPLEMENTING SOME OF OUR PROPOSED EXPECTATIONS I WOULD JUST NOTED A HIGH LEVEL THAT. WE'RE PROPOSING SOME SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES THAT ARE OVER AND ABOVE WHERE YOU SEE A EXPECTED TO BE. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE AND OTHER STATES ARE CUTTING HIGHER EDUCATION BUDGETS THIS IS A DRAMATIC OPPORTUNITY TO NOT JUST. NOT CUT BUT TO DO MORE THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING IS POSSIBLE. THE UC IS A CRITICAL INSTITUTION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TRAINS THE WORK FORCE DOES THE RESEARCH THAT MAKES THE ECONOMY MOVE FORWARD. AND GIVEN THAT THAT IT IS SUCH A SUCCESSFUL INSTITUTION WE DO THINK THAT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR PROPOSED EXPECTATIONS INCLUDING REACHING THE TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS GREATER ONLINE CAPACITY ABOUT THREE COVERED LEVELS. THE INCLUDING REACHING THE EQUITY GAPS WHICH THIS IS THE TIME TO MAKE EXTRA EQUITY A CENTRAL INSTITUTIONAL FOCUS. THE L. A. ALSO RAISED A CONCERN ABOUT. BY THE ONGOING NATURE OF OUR PROPOSED BASED AUGMENTATIONS AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT. THAT BECAUSE THE UC IS A IT'S A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE HIGHER EDUCATION IS A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE THAT'S WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMING FROM AND- BECAUSE IN THESE ONGOING RESOURCES. AT THE OTHER NOTE IS THAT YOU SEE IS NOT. ONLY MADE UP SOME OF THE COVERT EXPENSES AS NOTED BUT THE SIGNIFICANT THE BIGGEST PORTION OF THOSE CAME FROM AUXILIARIES AND FROM HOSPITAL COSTS SO DO YOU SEE BUDGET HAS A COMPLEX THERE'S COMPLEX IMPACTS ON IT FROM KOBE AND- IN OUR OUR EMPHASIS ON UNDERGRADUATE AND- GRADUATE EDUCATION AND OTHER. OTHER STATE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE MORE COMPLEX BUDGET WE DO THINK THESE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. PROVIDE THEM SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ENOUGH TO DO WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS PROPOSED AND- TO ADDRESS THEIR OTHER COSTS SO. HOPEFULLY THAT WAS A COVERED A LOT OF THINGS IT DID AND LET ME FOLLOW UP WITH THE UNIVERSITY ON JUST. A AND THEN BACK TO FINANCE ON ONE LAST QUESTION AND I'M SURE. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS A. N. FOR THE UNIVERSITY NOW THAT. ARE OF THE RESTORATION IS BACK DOES THAT IMPACT ANY POTENTIAL FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO TUITION INCREASE. IT RESTORATION GETS US BACK TO THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY- THIS SCHOOL YEAR FUNDING LEVEL. OVERSEE STILL HAS MANDATORY COST ROSE UP FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND FOR THE BUDGET YEAR- FOR THE CURRENT YEAR COST GROWTH IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR MILLION AND FOR THE BUDGET YEAR IT'S HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION- THOSE COSTS NEED TO BE COVERED WE'RE HOPING THAT THE STATE WILL COVERED THE BUDGET YEAR MANDATORY COST GROWTH AND WE INTEND TO COVER. OF THE CURRENT YEAR COST GROWTH THROUGH INTERNAL CUTS. BUT IT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR WILL STILL HAVE MORE POTENTIAL COST GROWTH OF MORE ENROLLMENT AS THOUGH WE ARE AT THIS POINT NOT WANTING TO COMMIT THE REGION'S TO ANY PARTICULAR ACTION ON TUITION- YEARS FROM NOW WE THINK THAT THAT IS A CONVERSATION WE HAD WITH THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING UNIVERSITIES FUNDING- BUT WE DO WANT TO PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY WITH STABLE FUNDING SOURCES- IF WE- HAVE. STEADY FUNDING INCREASES OF WEEKEND THEN COVERED THE COST AND- PROVIDE SERVICES TO ALL OUR STUDENTS MAKING CERTAIN THAT THE CURRENT STUDENTS RECEIVE THE SAME KIND OF SERVICES. THAT GENERATIONS BEFORE THEM DID. MORE WHILE I'M VERY GRATEFUL AS ONE OF THE GENERATIONS BEFORE THAT HAPPENED ABOUT LET ME ASK ONE FAR FROM UP TO YOU AND THEN BACK TO FINANCE YOU KEEP SAYING MANDATORY INCREASES A LOT OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED DROPPED- THAT IS CORRECT SIR WE- DO NEGOTIATE WITH ARTS IMPLEMENTED. IMPLEMENTING IT'S NOT SOMEBODY OUTSIDE MANDATED THE MATURE NEGOTIATED- AND YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING THOSE INCREASES IS THAT RIGHT. THAT IS THAT IS A CORRECT WAY TO PUT IT SIR MON WE ARE WE ARE IMPLEMENTING A PAY INCREASES FOR OUR UNIONIZED LABOR- I SUPPORT IT BELIEVE ME I SUPPORTED IT JUST THE WAY IT WAS SAID MANDATORY IT SOUND LIKE SOMEBODY FROM OUTSIDE. OF OUR DID THAT BUT YOU INTERNALLY DID NEGOTIATIONS FOR WORKERS SALARIES AND BENEFITS ARE FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES. THAT IS CORRECT SIR I WON'T CALL. ANYMORE WHILE. VERY WHAT WILL LET YOU GO THIS HEARING. A LET ME JUST ASK A- ONE LAST QUESTION A FINANCE ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S WITH REGARD TO POTENTIAL. ARE OFFERED TUITION INCREASE IS COHORT BASED TUITION AND AT AND I JUST WONDERED IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS ANY POSITION OR VIEWS ON THAT CONCEPT. WE DON'T WILL NOTE THAT ARE AT. OUR PROPOSED AUGMENTATION OF A HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION FOR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET COMES WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT. UNDERGRADUATE RESIDENT TUITION AND FEES REMAINED FLAT IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE UC NOTED. IN THE FUTURE ACTIONS ARE UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME FROM THE REGION'S PERSPECTIVE AND SO WE ARMY PERSPECTIVE AT THIS TIME OKAY. WELL WE'LL KEEP CHECKING IN COUNT ON IT. WELL OF IT AND THEN LET ME GO TO MEMBERS OF- SENATOR MEANT. THANK YOU TO OUR WITNESSES- I JUST WANT TO FIRST- REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE IN MY VIEW OF THE DAYS FUNDING INCREASES- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT AS I SUGGESTED EARLIER AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THIS- MY PERSONAL QUESTIONS ARE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AND THE FIRST ONE JUST ECHOES- OF THE TESTIMONY FROM UC'S WITNESS. AROUND THE CONDITION REQUIRING THAT THERE BE AN INCREASE IN OF 10% AND ONLINE OFFERINGS. AS YOU MAY KNOW BEFORE JOINING THE STATE SENATE I WAS A FACULTY MEMBER AT UC IRVINE AND I MYSELF TALK ONLINE CLASSES DURING THE SPRING AND FALL SEMESTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS I CAN TELL YOU FROM FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE THAT ONLINE TEACHING IS GENERALLY A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- BUT THERE'S ALSO A NUMBER OF OTHER PRINCIPLES I THINK IMPORTANT HERE FIRST- THERE'S THIS CONCEPT OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM WHICH IS A REALLY A CORE PRINCIPLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. R. THE IDEA IS THAT PROFESSORS SHOULD BE IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS REGARDING PEDAGOGY KEEPING TEACHING METHODOLOGIES AND LIKEWISE. AND I BELIEVE THAT A REQUIREMENT 410% ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASE IN ONLINE LEARNING WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY INFRINGE ON THE PEDAGOGICAL AUTONOMY OF. PROFESSORS AND OTHER FACULTY. I SECOND. EVEN IF IT WAS A PRO TO. ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM. I WOULD THINK THAT THIS DECISION TO PUT MORE ONLINE EDUCATION WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATELY MADE BY INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS. POSSIBLY BY CAMPUSES. IF IT WAS SEEM NECESSARY TO HAVE SOME KIND OF STATEWIDE PUSH. OUT FROM THE REGION'S RATHER THAN FROM SACRAMENTO- PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE IS JUST A- PLETHORA RESEARCH SUGGESTING. THAT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ONLINE LEARNING SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IS TRUE MYSELF. I ALSO THINK EQUITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE- YEAH I BELIEVE THE RESEARCH SHOWS AND THIS IS CERTAINLY MY EXPERIENCE WITH ONLINE TEACHING. THAT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE MORE EQUITABLE OUTCOMES IN ONLINE LEARNING WHICH HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY BAD IMPACTS ON LOW INCOME. NONTRADITIONAL AND FIRST TIME STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY YOU KNOW HAVING A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THEY'RE FACING. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION YOU ISSUES ONE OF THE POLICY RATIONALES. FOR THIS REQUIREMENT AND CAN YOU OUTLINE FOR US THE EVIDENCE AND DATA SUPPORTING. THE IDEA THAT THIS EDUCATION WOULD SUPPORT YOUR POLICY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS SENATOR MANDATE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE IS FIRST THE PROPOSAL IS A BERMAN EQUITY IN ACCESS LANDS FOCUSED FIRST ON THE STUDENTS WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE. OUR RANGE OF OPINIONS AND CHALLENGES THAT FACULTY AND EVERYONE HAVE FACED IN A SPECIALLY IN THE CODE ENVIRONMENT- THOSE ARE WIDELY REPORTED IN THE NEWS. BUT THE POLICY RATIONALE IS FIRST IF YOU THINK ABOUT STUDENTS FIRST AND YOU GO STATEWIDE NOT JUST IN THE UC SYSTEM BUT THE CCC'S THE CSU'S. THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF GEOGRAPHICAL AND FINANCIAL PRESSURES. THAT THAT ESPECIALLY NONTRADITIONAL ON UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS FACE. SO THE GOAL IS TAKE TO CREATE MORE FLEXIBILITY AND FREEDOM FROM A STUDENT'S PERSPECTIVE SO IF YOU HAVE TWELVE UNITS NOW SAY. AND AN ONLINE COURSE WOULD ALLOW YOU TO MAYBE TAKE THAT THAT ONE MORE COURSE FOR FIFTEEN UNITS DURING A SEMESTER FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S GOING TO BE DRAMATICALLY HELP MORE HELPFUL IN HELPING YOU MOVE THROUGH FOR THE DEGREE. I CUT YOUR COSTS OVER TIME OF HOW MUCH IT YOU KNOW IT COST YOU TO GET THAT DEGREE AND THERE'S ALL SORTS OF INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE NOW HAVE. THERE WAIT ON STUDENTS BEFORE COVERED THE COATED COVERED HAS NOW MADE WORSE. AND SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING NOT JUST WITH YOU SEE BUT WITH THE ALL THE SEGMENTS. IS THAT NOW THAT WE'VE PROVEN AS INSTITUTIONS WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE. OUR ONLINE COURSES BROADLY. WE SHOULD PRESERVE SOME OF THAT SO THAT GOING FORWARD ESPECIALLY THE NONTRADITIONAL AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS WHO FACE. DISPROPORTIONATE LEVELS OF THESE THESE PRESSURES ON THEIR FLEXIBILITY. THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS NOT JUST TO YOU SEE WHAT AT THE CSU IN CCC'S. ONLINE OFFERINGS. IT SO THAT IN THESE CASES THEY CAN THEY CAN TAKE MORE UNITS OR HAVE ACCESS AND GET THROUGH. SO TO THE TO THE POINT ABOUT THE QUALITY I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC DATA ON HAND BUT THE CCC'S WHO HAVE TRADITIONALLY SERVED. THE MOST NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE BIGGEST PROPORTION ONLINE. THEY HAVE DONE RESEARCH AND NOTED THAT. ABOUT A DECADE AGO THE- THE STUDENT PERFORMANCE THIS THE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES WERE WORKING THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN IN PERSON AND ONLINE THAT GAP IS SUBSTANTIALLY CLOSE TO ALMOST. OUR EQUALS SUCCESS IN ONLINE COURSES AND NOW THAT THEY'VE HAD A DECADE OF REALLY FOCUSING ON DEVELOPING IT AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE KEPT IN MIND WHEN TRYING TO EMPHASIZE THAT. ONLINE SHOULD BE PART OF THE MIX GOING FORWARD SO CUT THAT I'LL CUT IT OFF RIGHT THERE BUT I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS AND- I MEAN IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T I JUST I GUESS I DIDN'T HEAR ANY EVIDENCE TO MY AND I THE CONCERN I HAVE RUN EQUITY WHICH IS. YOU KNOW MY BELIEF AND CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF OTHER FACULTY THAT I'VE TALKED WITH SHARE THIS VIEW THAT- ONLINE LEARNING IS BAD BUT IT'S PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR A NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS. WHO FACE MANY MORE CHALLENGES AND THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY VERY PROBLEMATIC FROM EQUITY PRIME PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT TENDS. THE PERFORMANCES MAY DECLINE A LITTLE BIT FOR THOSE WHO ARE ARE HIGH PERFORMING YOU KNOW TENTH GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS- BUT THE GAPS ARE MUCH WIDER WITH THOSE WHO ARE FIRST TIME COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE LOW INCOME OR NONTRADITIONAL. AND I GUESS I I'M SERIOUS IF THAT THOUGHT HAS CROSSED THE MINDS. OF THE FOLKS CRAFTING THE POLICY. YEAH I'LL UNDER THE CONCERN AND NOTE THE AS A MENTIONED THIS. WHICH WERE. FAMILIAR WITH THE DEEPEST DIVE IN THE EVIDENCE. AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS BUT THEY HAVE SHOWED THAT OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO. WHEN THEY REALLY FOCUS ON ONLINE EDUCATION THAT GAP BETWEEN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN ONLINE VERSUS IN PERSON. HAS DRAMATICALLY NARROWED. THAT WAS ALSO TRUE OF UNDER REPRESENTED AND MINORITY STUDENTS- I THINK AS YOU HAVE YOU KNOW AS YOU MENTIONED THERE THERE ARE THERE GAPS EXIST BUT THE PROGRESS HAS BEEN. DRAMATIC AND SUBSTANTIAL OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS SPECIFICALLY THE CCC'S WERE ONLINE I WAS A LARGER PROPORTION OF COURSES AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT HAS HELPED INFORM. JUST UP FROM IF THAT'S HELPFUL I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE I DON'T KNOW IF THE UC REPRESENTATIVE HAS ANY RESPONSE TO THAT. THANK YOU CENTER MAN- WE WOULD PREFER ARE LIKE I SAID AT THIS TIME DID NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC PERCENTAGE INCREASE. LINK TO OUR ONLINE COURSES AND WE DO SEE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A POTENTIAL EXPANSION ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER AND- IN OFFERING STUDENTS WHO WANT TO DO ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL UNIVERSITY STUDYING. BUT TAKE ONLINE COURSES BUT WE WOULD PREFER TO FULLY STUDY WHAT HAPPENED DURING A REMOTE INSTRUCTION. AND THE SUCCESS THE DIFFERENT STUDENT GROUPS HAD- DURING THAT TIME THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THANK YOU- YEAH I GUESS I GUESS I I'M REMAIN TO BE CONVINCED BUT- I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE- THE PARMA FINEST. A SECOND CONCERN IT ONE OF YOUR OTHER CONDITIONS WITH THE DUAL MISSIONS PATHWAY. I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE L. A. O. OFFICES CONCERNS. AND I GUESS I FIRST HAD A QUESTION I WASN'T CLEAR FROM READING OUR- OUR BRIEFING. WHAT YOU STUDENT BEING IN SO SAY YOU'RE SCARED IN MY- I WANTED. TO FORMED- TO CUSTOMER COLLEGE AND ALSO THE UC IRVINE AND LET'S JUST SAY THAT STUDENT GOT A PERFECT GPA COAST COMMUNITY COLLEGES OVER TWO YEARS- GOT INTO USC AND UC BERKELEY. WOULD THEY BE LOCKED INTO ATTENDING UCI OR COULD BE ATTEND ANOTHER COLLEGE AT THAT POINT. I GUESS THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR- WE DO NOT ENVISION THE DUAL ADMISSIONS PROPOSAL TO BLOCK A STUDENT IN PERFECT BY ITS SUPPLY OPTION FOR THEM TO HAVE GUARANTEED ADMISSION UP FRONT TO A SPECIFIC CAMPUS. BUT OF COURSE IF THAT STUDENT ALSO APPLIED TO OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND WORK TO ACCEPT AN OFFER FOR TRANSFER OR IF THEY WERE TO APPLY FOR FRESHMAN ADMISSION WELL AND ACCEPTED ONE OF THOSE OFFERS THEY WOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE TO THEM AS WELL. GOT IT SO THE STUDENT IS NOT LOCKED IN THE STUDENT IF THEY PERFORM WELL CAN GO WHEREVER THEY WANT ON THE OTHER HAND. IF THE STUDENT DECIDES TO THE STATE UC IRVINE OR IF THEY PERFORM MAYBE NOT AS WELL AS THEY MIGHT UC IRVINE IS LOCKED INTO THE STUDENT SO LONG AS A STUDENT MEANS THE BASIC MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING. A TWO POINT FOUR GPA IS THAT CORRECT. THE DOOR ADMISSION. PROPOSAL AS AS WRITTEN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. THE FINANCIALLY WE SEE THAT A NEW. OPTION AN ADDITIONAL. FOR STUDENTS THAT WOULD OFFER THEM SOME GUARANTEE. UP FRONT BEFORE THEY EVEN STARTED THEIR COLLEGE COURSEWORK. BUT THEY WOULD STILL HAVE OTHER PATHWAYS AVAILABLE TO THEM. BUT THEY COULD STILL PURSUE A DIFFERENT PATH IF THEY SO CHOOSE THEY WOULD JUST HAVE A LOCKED AND- YOU'LL EMISSIONS AGREEMENT FOR. A SPECIFIC UC CAMPUS OFFERING. GUARANTEED ADMISSION ASSUMING THEY COMPLETE. THE REQUIREMENTS ARE OUTLINED AND NOT AGREEMENT SO THERE MAY BE SPECIFIC. GPA REQUIREMENT- COURSEWORK REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR TIME AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND OTHER AGREEMENTS THAT ARE WITHIN THAT THEY HAVE TO COMPLETE FRIENDS AND- THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSEWORK WITHIN TWO ACADEMIC YEARS IN ORDER FOR THE TOILET MISSION TO GREEN TO BE VALID. THE FONG AT THE STUDENT FOLLOWS THAT. AGREEMENT THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT. THEY WOULD HAVE A GUARANTEED ADMISSION FOUGHT FOR TRANSFER. UC CAMPUS. HOWEVER THEY CAN STILL OPTIONS TO ATTEND A DIFFERENT CAMPUS IF THEY- DECIDE TO APPLY THROUGH A DIFFERENT ROUTE OR TO GO TO AN INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION CURRENT. SO IT'S A ONE WAY OPTION BASICALLY LOCKS IN THE UC. BUT NOT THE STUDENTS. RIGHT YEAH. I MY ONLY MY FOR IS IT SHOULDN'T THESE TO YOU OF PER MATT I MEAN THEY THEY MATTERS. FOR THE SUIT THE STUDENT CAN WE ON TO. A QUOTE UNQUOTE BAY OR DIFFERENT INSTEAD IF THEY WANT. AND I GUESS YOU KNOW NOT A LIKE YOU KNOW I'VE FROM THE CHICAGO SO HERE. I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THIS PROPOSAL IS FRAUGHT WITH WHAT ECONOMISTS CALL MORAL HAZARD RIGHT. WHICH IS THAT IF I KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO GET INTO THE SCHOOL NO MATTER WHAT AS LONG AS I GET A TWO POINT FOUR GPA. I DON'T HAVE A LOT O INCENTIVES TO NECESSARILY WATER pTHE STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT STUDENTS WHO TO. APPLY THEMSELVES TO TWO YEARS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEY THEN APPLY TO YOU SEASON CSU'S THEY GET IN SOMEWHERE PRESUMABLY- THEY GET ACCEPTED THEY DECIDE TO GO. I MEAN THIS SEEMS LIKE IT'S JUST KIND OF CREATING- IT AGAIN AS I SAID A MORAL HAZARD PROBLEM. WHERE I KNOW I'VE GOT A SAFETY NET HERE- IN MY GOING TO PERFORMANCE I GUESS MY. REAL CONCERN IS DOES THIS SET UP. DO YOU SYSTEM MANY. WITH A REAL RECIPE FOR FAILURE HERE I MEAN YOU KNOW IT'S ALREADY HARD FOR A LOT OF THE STUDENTS YOU'RE YOU'RE TARGETING- LOCAL STUDENTS LOW INCOME STUDENTS NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS TO SUCCEED IN UC'S AND NOW YOU'RE SAYING TO THEM YOU JUST NEED TO GET TWO POINT FOUR GPA AND YOU GET TO GO TO THE YOU SEE THAT YOU WERE ADMITTED TO. ME THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SEEM LIKE IT'S SETTING STUDENTS UP FOR SUCCESS RIGHT RATHER THAN TAKING THE SORT OF CREAM OF THE CROP UP FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS IS THE CASE NOW THOSE STUDENTS THAT SEEM MOST LIKELY TO PERFORM AT A HIGH LEVEL AND I GUESS MY REAL QUESTION IS SHOULDN'T THESE TWO YEARS OF PERFORMANCE AS DEMONSTRATED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE MATTER IN ADMISSIONS DECISIONS. ABSOLUTELY THE TWO YEARS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE PERFORMANCE. SHOULD AND WOULD MATTER. FOR TRANSFER ADMISSION- I WOULD NOTE WITH REFERRED TO A SPECIFIC GPA REQUIREMENT. THE DOOR MISSION PROPOSAL DOES NOT EXPLICITLY TIE ITSELF TO A CERTAIN GPA REQUIREMENTS. IN FACT BECAUSE WE ENVISION AS BEING OFFERED AT ANY UC CAMPUS. WE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED AND PUT LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT. IF THE STUDENT HAS SELECTED A MAJOR OR A CAMPUS THAT IS IMPACTED. BUT YOU CAN USE THE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ESTABLISH SOME SUPPLEMENTAL CRITERIA. FOR INTENT THAT MAY BE A HIGHER GPA REQUIREMENT IF A STUDENT HAS CHOSEN- AND IMPACTED CAMPUS OR A PROGRAM THAT'S MORE COMPETITIVE. SO IN SOME CASES YOU SEE WOULD HAVE. AT LARGE IN EVERY CASE YOU SEE WOULD HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC TO A MISSION CRITERIA WE'VE JUST REQUIRED TO PASS THE OUTLINED UP FRONT. YOU'RE CONFIRMING THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE EQUITY IMPLICATIONS. ARE QUALITY AT THE END- ALLUDED SHE WAS ACTUALLY TO INCREASE ACCESS TO BE PRODUCTIVE UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. FROM MEDICAID FOR MEDITATION. IN VARIOUS WAYS. THANK YEAH WHAT IT HIGH CURRICULUM OF A- OR FINANCE ISSUES. I WILL JUST THAT THE NEW OF INCREASE FROM. ON THE TO THE HOUSE OF THE AND- WE'RE CERTAINLY. NOT NOT AND THAT THAT'S WHY RESULT IN. LOWERED TO FOR OF THE COMMUNITY. WERE BEING ADDED ACTUALLY STRONG A STRONG BENEFIT TO THOSE STUDENTS WHO FOR INSTANCE MAY BE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT. RIGHT UP FRONT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL THEY COULD RECEIVE NOT ONLY GUARANTEE OF ADMISSION BUT A VERY CLEAR PLAN THAT SAYS. THESE ARE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT I NEED TO MAKE WHICH CAN HELP THEM THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE JOURNEY NOT NECESSARILY AS THIS WITH THE BARE MINIMUM I WANT YOU ANY BETTER THAN THAT. BUT JUST SO THAT THEY HAVE IT SPELLED OUT BECAUSE ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HEARD WITH THE TRANSFER PROCESS. IS THAT SOMETIMES STUDENTS FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE SO THAT'S WHAT CREATE AN UP FRONT. MORE CLEARLY DEFINED OPTION FOR THEM WHERE THEY WOULD KNOW WHAT KIND OF THEIR MINIMUM EXPECTATION IS. BUT OF COURSE. YOU KNOW THERE'S NO LIMIT ON THAT THAT THEY NEED TO PERFORM ONLY TO THAT MINIMUM. AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE. OF GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND. I GUESS I GUESS MY QUESTION AND I JUST BE INTERESTED ONE MORE ABOUT THIS AN AWFUL CERTAINLY- LOOK FORTY HEARING MORE ABOUT THIS. PROGRAM BUT- IT WOULDN'T BE MORE DIRECT IF THE GOALS ARE EQUITY IS FINDING LOCAL STUDENTS- PROVIDING MORE CLARITY. WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER TO JUST TACK ON AS DALY- SUGGESTS TO THE EXISTING PATHWAYS. AND JUST TO SAY LIKE HEY YOU SEE I NEED TO TAKE A CERTAIN NUMBER. OF LOCAL STUDENTS FOR FIRST TIME STUDENTS WHO ARE- PERHAPS OF A CERTAIN MINORITY POPULATION- OR IN ANY OTHER FACTORS THAT WE WANT WOULDN'T THAT BE EASIER. AND AVOID SOME OF THAT MAYBE MORAL HAZARD IN IN SORT OF OTHER PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT. BE A CORD WITH THE APPROACH SUGGESTED NOW. WE JUST SAID OKAY YOU HAVE TO TAKE A NUMBER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF COLLEGE TRANSFERS- YOU KNOW THAT THAT SEEMS LIKE THAT MIGHT BE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD RIGHT. ENGINEERS BECAUSE THAT YOU GUYS ONE. THERE ARE EXISTING FIREMEN FONG YOU SEE IN TERMS OF- TRANSFORMATION- TRANSFER FRESHMAN RATIO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN ADHERING TO- WE WOULD NOTE THERE ARE SOME SOME. BUT THERE IS SOME COMPLEXITY IN TERMS OF PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION I'M LIMITATION ON THE UNIVERSITY OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE SPECIFIC QUOTAS THAT. FOR INSTANCE UNDER REPRESENTED OR CERTAIN MINORITY GROUPS STUDENT. ANSWER FOR HAVING SORT OF AN EXPLICIT REQUIREMENT ON THAT IN SOME CASES WOULD NOT BE PERMISSIBLE. FIVE SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING THAT THIS PROPOSAL APARTMENT ADDITIONAL OPTIONS THAT IS COMPLEMENTARY TO EXISTING TRANSFER PATHWAYS IN THE PLAN BUT IT IS TIED TO THE STUDENT COMPLETION OF AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR IF YOU SEE EQUIVALENT IF YOU SEE OFFICE TO ESTABLISH OR USE AN EXISTING PROGRAMS IN A QUICK WENT TO AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. OR ANOTHER ESTABLISHED TRANSFER PATHWAY. THAT STUDENTS WOULD HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TRANSCRIPTOMIC OF THE EXISTING TRANSFER PATHWAYS. BUT THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF HAVING A GUARANTEE OF ADMISSION FOR ANY CAMPUS UP FRONT BEFORE THEY'VE EVEN STARTED THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSE WORKING THAT HAVE THAT. KNOCKED OUT FOR THEM I APPRECIATE THAT AND I CERTAINLY SHARE MANY OF THE GOALS THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING HERE. MY LAST QUESTION- I GUESS ALSO FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE CONCERNS ABOUT RISING TUITION AND I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR HAS REPEATEDLY. EMPHASIZED IS TRYING TO KEEP. TUITION FLAT. FOR YOU CAN PERHAPS TIMES OF THIS A- THAT YOU'RE GIVING TO MAYBE ALONG TERM. ON HOLDING TO STUDY. AT THE- OUR PERSPECTIVE ON TUITION IS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO RIGHT NOW I WOULD NOTE THAT AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE UC MENTIONED THE UC RIDGE REGIONS DON'T HAVE A AN ACTUAL ACTION FRONT OF THEM SO THE- OUR PERSPECTIVE IS WE DON'T HAVE A VIEW. GO BEYOND THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU CENTER CENTER OF TROUBLE. JUST ONE QUESTION- AND I THINK. NOT SURE BECAUSE TO THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR THE YOU SEE THAT MY QUESTION IS THERE A FINANCIAL BENEFIT. FOR ONLINE LEARNING- ON AS YOU'RE PROMOTING THE INCREASE IN TEN PERCENT- FOR ONLINE STUDENTS IS THERE A BENEFIT OF COST BENEFIT TO DOING AN ONLINE SCHOOLING PROGRAM VERSUS AN IN PERSON PROGRAM. THIRD THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE BENEFIT FOR THE STUDENT IS THAT. THEN IT'S NUMBER ONE FOCUSED ON THE TIME IT TAKES YOU TO GET A DEGREE. IT TAKES YOU TWO YEARS TO ONCE YOU'VE TRANSFERRED TO UC TO GET THAT FOR YOUR BACHELORS- THAT'S MUCH CHEAPER THAN IT TAKING YOU TWO AND A HALF OR THREE YEARSAND WE'VE WE'VE NOTED THAT OVER THE LAST TEN OR SO YEARS A BIG EMPHASIS OF THE OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN ON. AFFORDABILITY FOR COLLEGE ONE OF THE- HE STRATEGIES FOR MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE. IS TO MAKE IT SO THAT YOU CAN GET OUT. FINISH YOUR OF YOUR YOUR INTENDED DEGREE WITH AS FEW UNITS AS POSSIBLE SO JUST JUST DO THE NUMBER YOU NEED DON'T DO MORNING UNITS BUT ALSO I. TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS THANK MORE. THAT'S GONNA BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN TAKING JUST TWELVE OR JUST SIX BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO STRETCH OUT THE TIME IT TAKES YOU SO IT'S NOT IN THE TUITION ISN'T IMPACTED BUT IT'S THE OVERALL COST. OF HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR COLLEGE NOT JUST IN TUITION BUT ALL THE COSTS ASSOCIATED LIVING IN AND FOOD AND ALL THIS THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE I'M A GREAT SO THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE IS. IF WE CAN GET YOU THROUGH MORE EFFICIENTLY WHICH ONLINE DOES HELP- THEN THEN IT'S GONNA BE HELP WITH AFFORDABILITY. THANK YOU THANK AND I HAVE A HAND FROM THE UC REPRESENTATIVE TO DO OF THE COMMENT YOU WISH TO. THANK YOU SIR- I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S PERSPECTIVE THE ONLINE COURSES ARE ACTUALLY NOT LESS EXPENSIVE% TO OFFER. OF TEN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BECAUSE IN ORDER TO DO AN ONLINE FOR SWELLED WITH EXCELLENT CONTENT- WELL- CRAFTED HOMEWORK AND EXAMS FOR THE STUDENTS. IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE QUITE EXPENSIVE SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THE FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S PERSPECTIVE TH COST- IS NOT AS MUCH LESS AS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. ARE THAT WILL COMPLETE OUR CONSIDERATION OF ISSUE TWO. AND I THINK THAT WAS THE BIG ONE OF BUT I KNOW THAT WE HAVE JUST OVER AN HOUR LEFT WE WRE SHOOTING TO BE DONE BY ELEVEN THIRTY SO. I DON'T KNOW ON PART OF IT TOO SO WILL TRY IF WE CAN ALL TRY TO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES WILL STILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE IS ANY AT THE END OF THIS SO WE NEED TO MOVE ALONG. SO MOVED ISSUE NUMBER THREE UC AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES IT'S THE SAME. THE SAME PANELISTS. SO WE'LL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. RIGHT DEPARTMENT FIGHTING- THANK YOU CHAIR ALL ALL KNOW THE BREVITY AND GOING FORWARD WILL BE FREE FOR THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND DO YOU SEE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A ONE POINT NINE. ELLEN DOLLAR- GENERAL FUND. AUGMENTATION THAT'S TO SUPPORT OPERATING COSTS OF. AMERICANS WITH RELIABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. OF THE STATE OR TENANTS FOR YOU STATE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES IT'S A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATORS PROVIDING RESEARCH ND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THE NUMBERS CONSTITUENTS STATEWIDE. AND OUTLINES THE VERY WELL SO I WON'T GO INTO THE INDIVIDUALS PROGRAMS OF THE A AND R. IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT THAT- WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE RESTORATION OF UC'S BUDGET WHICH ALSO MAKES A AND R. BRINGS A IN OUR SPENDING LEVELS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY LEVEL AND ALSO THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. AND PROVIDE A COST INCREASE OR IN OUR- BUT I DO WANT TO SAY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE CREATED SEPARATE LINE ITEM FOR YOU C. O. P. WE ARE REQUESTING THAT ALL OF YOU C. O. P. BE ALLOWED TO GO BACK TO WHAT'S CALLED A CAMPUS ASSESSMENT. WHERE THE CHANCELLOR'S ADVICE THE PRESIDENT AND RETURNS ON THE FUNDING LEVEL FOR YOU C. O. P. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL RATES A PARTIAL ASSESSMENT JUST FOR A AND R. BUT WE WOULD PREFER ALL OF YOU SEE- PICO BACK TO. THE CAMPUS ASSESSMENT MODEL UP. IF THE ASSESSMENT REMAINS IN THE BUDGET FOR ONLY AND ARE IT WOULD BE A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE CHANCELLOR'S THE PRESIDENT REGION'S ON THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVEL AND WHAT PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY. MUCH LMAO. GRAYSON CONSUL OR OF I BRIDGES MYSELF EDUCATION CALL. SALLY L. SO THE ISSUES FACING HERE VERY SIMILAR TO- YOU DISCUSSED IN THIS ONE MUCH SPACE PROVIDE IN THIS IT'S IT SPECIFIC DIVISION YOU SEE RATHER THAN ON THE CAMPUSES BUT VERY SIMILAR ISSUES IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL SUPPORT AND THE- GENERAL FUND LIMITED CAPACITY FOR ONGOING ASSAULTS- I DID WANT O TOUCH ON TO SPECIFIC IN OUR ISSUES TO THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST IS THAT- A FEW WEEKS AGO AT THE IN OUR DIVISION SUBMITTED TO OUR OFFICE AND INDEPENDENT COST PRESSURE ANALYSIS. ACTED GROWTH IN ITS JOB. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS OPERATING EXPENSES. AND I DO THAT ANALYSIS IN OUR SPENDING WOULD GROW TO SEVENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND I JUST FOR COMPARISON- UNDER THEIR FAVORITE GREEN IT WHICH FOCUSES ON A RESTORATION TO- FREE CODE LEVELS. IN OURS- FUNDING SUPPORT WOULD BE SEVENTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION SO THERE'S A BIT OF A GAP THERE- IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE INTERESTED IN AND LEARNING MORE ABOUT THIS WEEK WE THINK IT IT COULD YOU GO MORE INTO THE SPENDING PLAN- AS THE COMMITTEE NOTED IN THE LAST ISSUE- YOU SEE SPENDING ISN'T NECESSARILY MANDATORY- THEY'RE A MIX OF. ISSUES THAT ARE SOME OF THEM ARE MORE DISCRETIONARY SOME OF THE MOST DISCRETIONARY SO LEGISLATURE COULD WEIGH THOSE ISSUES WE ALSO FOUND THAT A WIN THAT DIVISION WAS PROJECTING SALARY INCREASES. HIS PROJECTIONS WERE- EXCEEDING MOST MEASURES OF INFLATION SO I GET. TO BE NICE TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL ON IT. TO THE ARAB GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL AND AGAIN I KNOW THAT JUST LIKE THE LAST ISSUE THERE ARE A COUPLE DIFFERENT PACKAGES AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO ELABORATE FOR THE COMMITTEE MORE ON THE DIFFERENT PACKAGES. THIS IS STILL A LITTLE HARD TO FOLLOW BY EACH- INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS WAS- A PROPOSAL TO CREATE A NEW CAMPUS ASSESSMENT TO SUPPORT A AND R. THE REGIONAL INTENT OF THIS CAMPUS IS TESTAMENT. WE'RE CAMPUSES WHERE WOULD BE CHARGED TO SUPPORT IN OUR DELIBERATIONS WAS TO RESTORE IN OURS LEVELS ON THREE MAJOR GENERAL FUND. AND THIS NEW CAMPUS BE. NOW WITH THE OF. GREENMAN PLAY AND STATE PROVIDE. A REST. ENTIRELY THE GENERAL FUND. ON THE STATUS OF THE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS A LITTLE UNCLEAR TO LAST. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT STILL REMAINS ON THE TABLE WE RECOMMEND. ARE REJECTING- THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A CLEAR POLICY BASIS TO CHARGE CAMPUSES ON TO SUPPORT. IN OUR- AND ARTISANS IT'S A PROVIDE CAMPUSES ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES INSTEAD OF SEPARATE PROGRAM AND A LOT OF ITS PROGRAMMING OCCURS I'M OFF CAMPUS. WITHOUT IT WE HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS- OF FOR VESTER LEGISLATORS THAT REPRESENT MONTEREY COUNTY HAVE A FAIRLY STRONG LETTER FROM THE FARM BUREAU. IN WHICH OF THE THEY BASICALLY POINT OUT TWO THINGS THAT FUNDING HAS BEEN FLAT IN THE- IT IN THE COUNTY EXTENSION COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND THEY HAVE. EXCEPTIONAL RESEARCH NEEDS IN RELATION TO NOVEL PEST AND DISEASE RESEARCH AS IT AFFECTS LEAFY GREENS WERE THERE ARE BEEN SOME. SOME PARTICULAR UP- ISSUES IN THAT REGION. AND SO ES WAS JUST SAID IT JUST SEEMS TO BE FLAT YEAR TO YEAR AND IT SEEMS LIKE ARE NOW ALSO THIS IS ALL IN TERMS OF. WHAT THE MONEY IS IN THE MONEY BEING FLAT AND WHEN IT'S FLAT THAT MEANS IT'S A CUT EVERY YEAR BY INFLATION AND THEY'RE BEEN VACANCIES. ANSWER YOUR VACANCIES AND YOU HAVE FLAT MONEY AND YOU HAVE EXCEEDING DEMANDS AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF ANALYSIS OF WHETHER WE'RE REALLY MEETING THAT DEMAND AND THEN IT FEEDS INTO WHAT THE L. A. O. JUST SAID. WHICH IS THIS DEPENDS ON THE CAMPUSES ARE PAYING IN SO THIS EXTERNAL RESEARCH THAT IS REALLY OF BENEFIT COMPETES AGAINST INTERNAL CAMPUS THINGS AND ED IN MY POLITICAL UNDERSTANDING WOULD BE THE INTERNAL CAMPUS THINGS WOULD ALWAYS WIN. THIS SO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT COOPERATIVE EXTENSION ISN'T REALLY ADDRESSING THE FORMALLY THAT'S BEING IDENTIFIED BY ITS- ITS PARTNERS RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR THE CALL SIR. BACK TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE THE LINE ITEM TO USE OKAY BUDGET DUE TO SOME CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY THE US STATE AUDITOR SINCE THAT TIME THE A AND R. BUDGET HAS BEEN HELD FLAT. IN TWENTY NINETEEN A. N. R. RECEIVED ITS OWN LINE ITEM- WHICH WAS FLAT AND THEN LIKE THIS IN THE CURRENT YEAR REDUCED DRAMATICALLY DUE TO THE STATE BUDGET CUTS- WHEN THE LEGISLATURE LINE ITEMS A PARTICULAR FUNCTION WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO ALTER THAT AMOUNT OF FUNDING. EIGHT EIGHT DIVISH STILL HAS COST INCREASES THAT ARE- THAT. UNIVERSITY IMPOSES OR THAT WE CAN NEGOTIATE OF THAT GREAT BUT ARE NOT THURMOND BUT ARE NOT MANDATORY RIGHT. I'M JUST KIDDING I AM. I WAS COST OF LIVING INCREASE SAYS YOU HAVE- NON SALARY COST INCREASES YOU HAVE LOST INCREASES FOR UP YOUR YOU KNOW LET ME ASK THE QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF THE ACTIONS IS JUST MY SPECULATION WERE TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SEE. THIS PROGRAM INCREASE AND IT MAY HAVE HAD A COUNTER INTUITIVE- COUNTER. RESULT SO WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO GET INCREASES IN THIS PROGRAM TO MEET THE DEMANDS GIVEN ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE SAYING ABOUT. LINE ITEM NOT LINE ITEM BILLING THAT CAMPUS IS NOT GOING TO CAMPUSES WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO GET AN INCREASE FOR THIS- TO POTENTIAL ACTIONS THAT I SEE FOR YOU SIR YOU COULD INCREASE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IN THE A AND R. LINE ITEM. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES THAT YOU WANT THEM TO UNDERTAKE SUCH AS THE PAST MANAGEMENT- YOU COULD THEN YOU COULD ALSO MOVE ALL OF YOU C. O. P. OFF THE LINE ITEM. GIVE ALL THAT GENERAL FUND BACK TO THE CAMPUSES AND THEN THE CAMPUS IS COULD USE A MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES TO FIND YOU SEE- PAGE WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE THE CAMPUSES MORE STATE GENERAL FUND. FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES AND THEY MAY BE MORE WILLING TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO USE YOUR PH CURRENTLY THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE NOT BEING CHARGED- THROUGH THE ASSESSMENT WHICH WE USED TO HAVE. FOR THE OPERATIONS OF U. C. O. P. AND WE DO PROVIDE QUITE A BIT OF SERVICES FOR THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM SO- IF WE WERE TO MOVE BACK TO THE CAMPUS ASSESSMENT BECAUSE THE CAMPUS IS WOULD USE THE MULTITUDE OF FUNDING SOURCES. IT COULD ACTUALLY ALLOW US TO INCREASE THE BUDGET FOR A AND R. I KNOW THAT WOULD MEET YOUR CARNAL DESIRES AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WE WOULD HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WOULD ACTUALLY BE AN INCREASE WELL WE JUST MOVED BACK TO CAMPUS SO. I THINK I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT BETWEEN NOW AND THE MAY REVISE IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO FIND A WAY THAT ACTUALLY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE WITH CERTAINTY RATHER THAN CHANGES THE PROCESS AND THEN WE SEE WHAT THE CAMPUSES DO. IT BECAUSE THE REAL ISSUE IS LACK OF RESEARCH AND A NOT FOR RESEARCH A. M. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE A COST OF LIVING INCREASE WHETHER VACANCIES NEED TO BE FILLED. ON WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE A FLAT OUT INCREASE BUT I THINK BEFORE WE DID IT EVEN THOUGH IF YOU'RE HEARING THERE'S A DESIRE WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THERE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE AN OUTCOME- THAT THAT THE TAXI GOING TO LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN RATES. IF WE DID AND I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S TALK ABOUT THE STRESSFUL BUT- I JUST. THAT IF YOU WANT TO THE MORE RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA NEAR UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES OR THAT HAVE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION DAY WOULD FEEL STRONGLY TO SAY MORE. SO ARE WE JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT BUT- BUT JUST I HAVE CLEARLY NOTED THE ISSUE AND HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS A SENATOR MEANT- JUST BRIEFLY I WANT TO ECHO MY SUPPORTERS PROGRAM AS WELL. I THINK IT SERVES A LOT OF IMPORTANT PURPOSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE SO MUCH OPEN SPACE AND NATURAL RESOURCES. WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF- ISSUES RELATED TO WILDLIFE- NATURAL FLORA AND FAUNA AND WILDFIRES AND AYE AYE AYE- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS PROGRAM. HE STEADILY FUNDED. THANK YOU AND THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR TROUBLED. APPRECIATE THAT PANEL. WILL MOVE TO THE- THE EXACT SAME PANEL. ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR STUDENT SUPPORTS AND BASIC NEEDS AND WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DAY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES. FIFTEEN MILLION. ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO NECESSARY TECHNOLOGICAL AR. OUR ONLINE DEVICES AND HIGH SPEED BROADBAND ACCESS FOR STUDENTS. ALL NOTED THAT THIS IS FIFTEEN MILLION ADDITIONAL TO AN EXISTING FIFTEEN MILLION THAT UC'S BUDGET ALREADY HAS OR FOOD INSECURITY AND HOUSING AND SECURITY WHICH ARE ARE BROADLY SEEN AS BASIC NEEDS FOR STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES- THE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES ONE TIME FUNDING A PROPOSED FIFTEEN MILLION. FOR EMERGENCY STUDENT FINANCIAL AID- THAT THAT COMES WITH SOME SPECIFICATIONS FOR ALLOCATING TWO CAMPUSES AND TO STUDENTS THAT WE SPELL OUT AND BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE- THE FINAL PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS ON THESE STUDENTS SUPPORT SERVICES IS TO EXTEND AN EXISTING SUMMER FINANCIAL AID. OF FINANCING FOR PROGRAM. FOR ONE YEAR SO CURRENTLY IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE SUMMER FINANCIAL AID THE UC RECEIVES WOULD BE CUT IN HALF WE'RE PROPOSING TO IT WOULD BE CUT IN HALF FROM FOUR MILLION TO TWO MILLION BECAUSE IT SUNSETS HALFWAY THROUGH THE YEAR. WE'RE PROPOSING. YOU SEE RECEIVES THE SAME FOUR MILLION FOR SUMMER FINANCIAL AID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE THIS YEAR. AND THOSE ARE BIG PROPOSALS WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THANK YOU UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESS AS WELL AS THE ONE TIME FINANCIAL AID AND WE'RE REQUESTING YOUR SUPPORT OF THESE ITEMS- I DO WANT ALSO EXPRESSED A DEEP APPRECIATION TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR THE EASIEST FUNDING WE HAVE RECEIVED. WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO ESTABLISH INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESSES USED SIR STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUSES ONGOING FUNDING IS CRUCIAL TO REALLY PROVIDING BASIC NEEDS YEAR AFTER YEAR AND REDUCING DE UM REDUCING THE DESPERATION ON CAMPUSES FOR SOME STUDENTS- IN TERMS OF THESE NEW FUNDS FOR THE BASIC NEEDS WE WOULD USE THESE FUNDS TO. HIRE ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS ON THE CAMPUSES TO PROVIDE TARGETED MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSES LIKE SCREENING TOOLS PROACTIVE PSYCHO EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS AND OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT ARE DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH CULTURAL AFFINITY GROUPS AND OTHER STUDENTS SERVICES PROGRAMS ON OUR CAMPUSES- IN ADDITION THE STUDENT TECHNOLOGY FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES. SUCH AS PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH LAPTOPS AND HOT SPOT RIGHT BY WE WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS FOR HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS AND WE WOULD PURCHASE LEARNING ACCESSIBILITY. SOFTWARE FOR OUR DISABLED STUDENTS- AT STATE REALLY LOOK TO OUR FINANCE AID SYSTEM TO PROVIDE AND OF HEALTH FOR STUDENTS AND WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO TRY TO INCREASE THE WHOLE GRANT AMOUNT OR STUDENTS SO WE'RE HOPING THAT BACK WILL ALSO IMPACT IN THE FUTURE BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE EARLY ACTION BILL AB EIGHTY FIVE OF THE APPROVED SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FOR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO INCREASE OUR CALVET BRUSH ENROLLMENTS OF THESE FUNDS WILL ALLOW THE CAMPUS IS TO HIRE STUDENT WORKERS PURCHASE EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE. AND UNDERTAKE OTHER. HOW FRESH- BECAUSE WE'RE A PUBLIC INSTITUTION AND WE HAVE A MISSION AND REALLY STRIVE TO SERVE LOW INCOME STUDENTS WERE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE BASIC NEEDS ISSUES WELL INTO THE FUTURE- BUT PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH THESE BASIC NEEDS SAFETY THAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT IT TRAINING A COLLEGE EDUCATION POSSIBLE FOR STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO SPEAK TODAY. THANK YOU LMAO. SO THIS IS ALSO AN ISSUE THAT HAS A LOT OF CROSSOVER TO PROPOSALS AND CSU THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSED A LOT OF THESE ISSUES I KNOW YOU'RE IN TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE SO I'LL KEEP MY COMMON SUBJECT TO JUST A HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF WHAT YOU HEARD A FEW WEEKS AGO HAPPY ALLOWED READ MORE ON HUMANE. FIRST BEFORE THE PROPOSED FIFTY MILLION AN ONGOING GENERAL FUND IN THIS ISSUE WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO COMBINE TWO VERY DIFFERENT PRIORITIES STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT TECHNOLOGY AND THERE ISN'T A CLEAR NEXUS BETWEEN THESE TWO DIFFERENT PRIORITIES SO IN THIS CASE WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO BETTER CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF THIS- PROPOSAL MAYBE CONSIDER. TACKLING EACH ISSUE SEPARATELY. FOR THE PROPOSED FFTY MILLION IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. FOR EMERGENCY STUDENT DATA HERE WE KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH INFORMATION AS- TO HOW THIS WILL AMOUNT WOULD INTERACT WITH THE MUCH LARGER AMOUNT OF FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDING THAT YOU SEE IS RECEIVING ALSO FOR STUDENTS. AND WORKING CA. I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING SOME MORE INFORMATION FROM YOU SEE ON HOW THEY INTEND TO SPEND. THEIR OF FEDERAL RELEASE STUDENT. AID FUNDS AND THEN DESIGNING THIS ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION AWAY THAT- COHERENTLY INTERACTS WITH THAT SO THAT WE'RE MAXIMIZING THE DOLLARS AND COVERING ALL THE INSTEAD STUDENT POPULATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE DESIRES- I'M MORE. OUR OFFICE HAS NOTED SOME CONCERNS WITH THE STATE'S OVERARCHING APPROACH TO SUPPORTING BASIC NEEDS AND RECENT YEARS. ON THE STATE TO DATE HASN'T TAKEN A VERY UNIFIED WAY TO SUPPORT BASIC NEEDS- DOESN'T HAVE AN OVERARCHING PLAN TO ADDRESS STUDENT BASIC NEEDS. AND A LOT OF THE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED TO DATE HAVE BEEN PIECEMEAL. WE HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON HOW THE STATE MIGHT TAKE A MORE- DELIBERATE AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING STUDENT BASIC NEEDS TO GET HAPPY TO. ELABORATE MORE ON THAT AND YOU MAY. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AMNESTY OTHER TWO SENATORS OF EITHER OF THEM HAD QUESTIONS THEY WANT TO LEAD OFF WITH ON THE SIDE. NO ARE. WE DON'T FOR ME EITHER AND I THINK- I WOULD JUST. MAKE A COMMENT MAY BE IN THE INTEREST OF- THIRD TIME BECAUSE- HE I VISITED MY WN HOME CAMPUS RUN THE ALMA MATER WAS THE IS MY ALMA MATER AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND TO WHAT WAS REFERRED TO AS A NON TRANSACTIONAL CAFE. AND IT MEANT THAT OF STUDENTS COULD AVAIL THEMSELVES OF FOOD WITHOUT HAVING TO DEMONSTRATE THE NEED AS TO WHY THAT IT DIDN'T DRIVE THEM AWAY WITH THE STIGMA THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO ME THAT THAT WAS GOING ON AND APPARENTLY THE NEED WAS REALLY DRAMATIC AND GIVEN BEFORE BUT PARTICULARLY DURING THE PANDEMIC THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. ARE EQUAL STRONG AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S- THERE'S VACANCIES THAT STILL EXISTED THE AT THE COUNSELING LEVEL WHAT YOU SEE AND SO. LET ME JUST CALL ATTENTION TO THOSE ISSUES RATHER THAN ASK QUESTIONS AND JUST SAY THAT WE WILL. REALLY WANT TO WORK. BY THE TIME THE MAY REVISE FIRMS THINGS UP IT AND WHETHER OR NOT. THESE ISSUES ARE IN FACT BEING ADDRESSED BECAUSE OF THE- BOB KARP OF REAL IMPORTANCE SO I WOULD THANK THE PANELISTS. AND I WOULD MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. WHICH IS- YOU SEE PRIME GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AND UC HEALTH PROPOSALS IT'S THE SAME THREE AND WILL BEGIN WITH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO IS TO FRAME ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS THERE'S TWO BIG PICTURE KEY POINTS TO KEEP IN MIND ONE IS THERE'S A- THERE'S UNEVENNESS ACROSS THE STATE IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. THE LAST YEAR THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET INCLUDED NEW INVESTMENTS FOR UC RIVERSIDE MEDICAL SCHOOL AND ALSO UCSF UC MERCED. A PARTNERSHIP IN FRESNO. AND THE REASON WAS AND STILL IS THAT THE FEDERAL RECOMMENDS SIXTY TO EIGHTY ARE. PERSONAL PHYSICIANS FOR EVERY HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE BUT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IS THAT HALF OF THAT RECOMMENDATION SO THERE'S A DRAMATIC NEED THERE WHEREAS SOME OF THE URBAN AREAS TO CALIFORNIA HOW MUCH HIGHER RATIO PHYSICIAN TO POPULATION. RIGHT SO TO ADDRESS THE GEOGRAPHICAL UNEVENNESS USAGE PRIME HAS BEEN A WITH LAST YEAR'S INVESTMENT AND GOING FORWARD WILL BE CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING HEALTH RELATED INEQUITIES. SO THE- THEY GO BUDGET FOR TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION FOR A YOU SEE PRIME THE PROGRAM THAT THAT SUPPORTS MEDICAL EDUCATION IN SPECIALIZED WAYS WITH TARGETING SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHICAL. AREAS THIS COMES WITH THE SPECIFIC ACTED SPECTATORS IN THE TWELVE POINT NINE IS SPENT TO EXPAND EXISTING USED IMPROPERLY GRAMS. TO ESTABLISH A NEW NATIVE AMERICAN FOCUSED PRIME PROGRAM. ALSO ARE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING AN AMERICAN BUT AN ADDITIONAL PROGRAM WHICH ARE YOU SEE HAS INDICATED THEY WILL MAKE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FOCUS PROGRAM. SO THAT WOULD BE TWO NEW PRIME PROGRAMS. ARE AND THAT A THIRD OF THE TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION WOULD GO TOWARDS NEEDS BASED FINANCIAL AID FOR STUDENTS. SO THAT'S THE PRIME PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR ALSO HAS TWO OTHER RELEVANT PROPOSALS HERE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ONE IS AN ADDITIONAL ONE R. ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND. FOR PROP FIFTY SIX GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION- I'M BEING TOLD THAT I SAID FOR THE UC PRIME THAT THE- APOLOGIES FOR MISS SPEAKING BUT THAT OUR OUR SPECIFIC REQUEST WAS THAT THE TWELVE POINT NINE FIND A NEW NATIVE AMERICAN AND- PRIME PROGRAM AND IN ADDITION TO THAT. THE WE SPECIFIED A NEW NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAM WULD COME WITH THE FUNDS. WE LEFT OPEN A SECOND PROGRAM. WOULD BE OPEN ENDED AND THE UC HAS AS IN IT WILL MAKE THAT SECOND NEW UC PRIME PROGRAM IN AFRICAN AMERICAN. ENTERED ONE SO I MAY HAVE MISSPOKEN THERE'S A NATIVE AMERICAN AND AN AFRICAN AMERICAN PROGRAMS THAT WE EXPECT TO COME OUT OF THE TWELVE POINT NINE. NEW PRIME FUND. TO MOVE ON TO THE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROP FIFTY SIX PROPOSAL. SO PROPERTY SIX PROVIDED FORTY MILLION IN AN ONGOING SPECIAL FUNDS FOR YOU SEE BUT BECAUSE TOBACCO AS A REVENUE SOURCE IS DECLINING THE- THE MINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO BACK FILL. THAT AMOUNT AND KEEP YOU SEE HOLE AT A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR AMOUNT. SO THIS YEAR WE'RE PROPOSING THAT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE UC RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND. SO THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN THAT FORTY MILLION LEVEL. FIFTY SIX FUNDS. THOSE FUNDS GO TO FIND A RESIDENCY SLOTS FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. THE THIRD RELEVANT PROPOSAL HERE IS WE'RE WE'RE PROPOSING A ONE TIME ONE POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR A UC CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONSORTIUM. THE CONSORTIUM WAS BORN OUT OF THE COALBED CRISIS IN MARCH APRIL WHERE THE STATE NEEDED AWAY BETWEEN THE UC'S AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO COORDINATE MODELING VARIOUS SCENARIOS RELATED TO OUR THINKING THROUGH THE CRISIS. ARE THE NEEDED DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS NAY NEEDED I T. AND STAFFING SUPPORT TO DO THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A ONE TIME WAY OF TO SET UP A- CONSORTIUM FOR IMPROVING. PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY IN RESPONSE TIMES. BUT IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE IN THE WAY THAT THEY'VE MODELED IT FINANCIALLY NOW AND THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT WOULD REALLY HELP CONTINUING THROUGH BUDGET YEAR AND ARE AND HELP THEM FIGURE OUT WAYS OF GOING FORWARD. TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATE REPUBLICAN THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION WERE HEALTHY HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YOU SEE. AIR CANADA FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BUDGET PROPOSES TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION FOR NEW INVESTMENTS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION THAT WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS AND THE STATE YOU SEE PROGRAMS A MEDICAL EDUCATION ALSO KNOWN AS PRIME TRANSMETA CALL STUDENTS TO PRACTICE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THOUGHT HEALTH EQUITY IS A CENTRAL ELEMENT IN ALL PRIME PROGRAMS THE SPECIAL TRAINING THESE GRADUATES RECEIVE PREPARES THEM FOR LEADERSHIP ROLES COMMUNITY ENGAGE CLINICIANS EDUCATORS RESEARCHERS AND SOCIAL POLICY ADVOCATES FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. OF SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA LIVE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN LAST NEXT AN AMERICAN INDIAN- ALSO WITH IN CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A DOCTOR SHORTAGE ABOUT ONE THIRD OF OUR DOCTORS ARE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY AND THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO START RETIRING SOON AND WE NEED TO TRAIN TO REPLACEMENT WORK FOR STUFF. WILL COME BEHIND THEM. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR MINISTER ABOUT- HAS. FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY POINT STUDENTS- THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNOR BOB WOULD ALLOW YOU SEE TRUCKS BAND THE PRIME WITH TWO NEW PROGRAMS. I WANT TO SERVE THE AMERICAN INDIAN NATIVE ALASKAN COMMUNITIES AND THE OTHER TO START BY COMMUNITIES- ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE FUNDING PROPOSED WOULD GO TOWARD FINANCIAL AID FOR PRIME STUDENTS. CURRENTLY 74% OF PRIME STUDENTS TAKE ON STUDENT DEBT WHILE THEY'RE ENROLLED AT UC MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THE AVERAGE DEBT UPON GRADUATION FOR YOU SEE MEDICAL STUDENTS. IS ABOUT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THEIR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT- AND IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO WORK IN EXTREMELY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO HAVE THAT KIND OF STUDENT THAT THE FINANCIAL AID WOULD REALLY HELP ALLEVIATE. THAT I WANT TO KNOW- THAT WE WERE BE PRO THE- WITH WORKING REST. TO SOME OF THE ISSUES OF BY THE L. A. L. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION RIGHT THIS MOMENT FOR WILL BE DOCTORS COM WEEK HOPEFULLY THE WHOLE CALL. SOME OF THE CRIME. RAISED IN YOUR- AND I JUST TO CLOSE WITH THAT IT TAKES- ABOUT SEVEN. MINIMUM THE TRAIN A DOCTOR FOR YOUR OF MEDICAL SCHOOL THREE ABROAD. OR WHAT ALL THESE. RETIRE VERY AND ARKHAM. IN CRISIS WE CAN WAIT ANY LONGER STAR TRAINING YOUR DOCTORS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU LMAO. ALL MY CAR ON CRIME PROPOSAL AS IT'S FAR THE LARGEST IN THIS ISSUE. FOR I DID INTO OUR COMMENTS I FIRST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE THINK OBJECT THAT THE ADMIN. AND THE UNIVERSITY- I DON'T. IN THEIR CUSTOMER. THINGS LIKE ADDRESS LONG PHYSICIAN WERE IS. ADDRESSING HEALTH ISSUES ARE COMMENDED PRIOR AND WE'RE OF COULD. IN THE STATE BUDGET. DESPITE THE COMMENDABLE. WE HAVE SEVERAL KINDS WITH THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL. AND WE JUST FOR ALL OVER ALL OVER ARE ON PAGE THREE ONE OF YOUR CHEN- BUT THAT SOMEONE OUR NUMEROUS CAR I THOUGHT IT'D BE HELP TO- GROUP THEM INTO THREE BUCKETS. THE FIRST BUCKET AMERICAN. ARE IS AROUND THE. A LACK OF LONG TERM PLAN THAT WE IT'S- TO SOME OF THE OBJECTS THAT ADVENTURE. AND UNIVERSITY AYE DADDY. JUST TO GIVE YOU ONE AND- IF YOU TURN TO PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR ENGINE AT YOUR SEE IN BOTH. THE SUMMER OF THESE CRIME PRO. AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'LL IS A THE PRIMARY HAVE MANY. MISSIONS AVERAGE FOCUS ON HEALTHCARE. OTHERS ARE TARGET TOWARDS ISSUE LIKE OUR FOCUS ON THE SAME JOAQUIN. FOCUSING ON ON THE CERTAIN LINE AND GRAPHIC. GROUP ARE BUT THEY KNOW SEEM ACCORDINGLY AND BE OF THAT A DE- YOU KNOW REMAINING OR IN USE- EIGHT. PROGRAMMING ADDITIONAL CAL REGION ARE CAN YOU. ARE BEING LEFT A DRAFT. YOU SEE ALSO LACKS A LONG TERM- PLANETS OVER BETTER. SCHOOL IN THE- YOU THOUGH THAT'S NOT MY PERCENT ITS MEDIC SCHOOL. AND SO IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW IT'S PLANS. HEALTH PLAN TO ADDRESS THE PROJECT SHORTAGES IN PRIMARY CARE BECAUSE THAT SEE- A LITTLE TOO EARLIER. OUR SECOND. BOB OF CONCERNS ARMS THE BUDGET. THAT THE IS PER TO TAKE AND YOU AS. EXAMPLE OF THE IMAGE IS PER TO PROVIDE ALL. THE FUNDING FOR PRIME UP FOR IN THE BY YEAR. EVEN THOUGH MUCH OF THE WATER OR THE NEXT. PAGE NOT ONLY DO WE THINK PROVIDING UP FRONT UP FRONT UP FRONT FUNDING IS INEFFICIENT IN THAT IT PROVIDES FUNDS AND SOME YEARS WERE LIKE HOT WEATHER COSTS HAVE BEEN INCURRED YET ON BUT ALSO WEAENS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE FUNDS. AND HERE WE THINK THE STATE'S EXPERIENCE OF SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PRIME- PROVIDES AND ARE USEFUL EXAMPLE ON IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE STATE PROVIDED SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PRIME- FUNDS UP FRONT FOR FORTY EIGHT STUDENTS ON WHAT THE PROGRAM IS HAD SOME IMPLEMENTATION DELAYS AND CURRENTLY ENROLLS THIRTY SIX STUDENTS- IT DOESN'T ANTICIPATE HITTING THAT FORTY EIGHT STUDENTS ARE MARKING TOLD. A UNTIL A FEW YEARS FROM NOW. REGIONALLY THE LAW. TO WHITE TO HAVE IT. ON ON THE EMPLOYMENT CHALLENGES BY PROVIDING THE FUNDS ALL FRENCH MISSING OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW THESE PLANS ANNUALLY AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. YEAH THAT'S WE JUST ONE ISSUE WE HAVE THE BUDGET APPROACH WE HAVE SEVERAL OTHER CONCERNS WITHOUT. PER STUDENT FUNDING RATE THAT YOU SEE IS PROPOSING OF THE LACK OF ENROLLMENT TARGETS IN THE IN THE- PROPOSED BUDGET BILL AND ALSO THE LACK OF REGULAR REPORTING ON TO ASSESS THE OUTCOMES OF THE PROGRAM AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS- OPERATING EFFECTIVELY. SH THE FINAL BUDGET OF OUR CONCERNS ARE AROUND THE FACT IS THAT A SIZABLE PORTION OF THESE FUNDS ARE INTENDED ARE INTENDED TO BOLSTER SUPPORT FOR EXISTING ENROLLMENT DATA EXISTING PROGRAMS. RATHER THAN FINDING NEW ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THIS IS A MIXED THAT THERE COULD BE SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR EXAMPLE THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNIVERSITY NOTE THAT SOME OF THIS FUNDING WOULD BE TO- BOLSTER FINANCIAL AID FOR STUDENTS AND ADDRESS THEIR STUDENT DEBT LEVELS. WE THINK THIS IS PROTECT POTENTIALLY REASONABLE BUT THE UNIVERSITY HASN'T PROVIDED A FULL ESTIMATE OF STUDENTS NEED. ON THE BECAUSE OF THAT THE LEGISLATURE LITTLE BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PROPOSED ONE THIRD SATISFIED IS THE CORRECT AMOUNT TO. ADDRESS STUDENT DEBT LEVELS. FURTHERMORE I SIDLE PORTION OF THIS. WOULDN'T BE FOR FINANCIAL DATED BEFORE OTHER RESTORATION AND HERE WE THINK THE UNIVERSITY HAS NOT PROVIDED ENOUGH JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS WEEK WE THINK THIS COULD BE AMONG THE LEGISLATURE'S. LOWER PRIORITIES IN THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. ALTHOUGH THAT IN MIND- WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE SEVERAL STOPS- HELP ADDRESS THAT ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. ONE IS TO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION AND YOU SEE TO ESTIMATE. OF BETTER PROPOSALS THE LEGISLATURE. BETTER PROPOSAL HAVE LONG PLANNING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS I DESCRIBED EARLIER WOULD HAVE A BETTER PER STUDENT FUNDING RATE FOR EXAMPLE. AND WHAT THESE BETTER PLANS IN PLACE WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE ITS OWN APPROACH TO SUPPORTING PRIME ONE THAT- INSURERS IT HAS A PROPER OVERSIGHT OVER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF. PROPOSAL FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE- SPREAD GROWTH OCCURS THE LEGISLATURE CAN GET ADDITIONAL REPORTING ON OUTCOMES- TO IN TO ASSESS THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM. SECOND I KNOW THAT WAS A LOT OF HAPPY TO ELABORATE FURTHER IN THE Q. AND A ON ON ANY OF THESE MATTERS. ARMY JUST OF. THANK YOU THE PANELISTS N. OUR I KNOW THAT WERE REALLY RUNNING LIGHT IN THE- THE VC SAID THEY'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO COMMENTS AND I KNOW THAT I'VE HEARD FROM ONE SENATOR OF HIS STRONG SUPPORT FOR PRIME AT THE VET CENTERS ON HERE LET ME ASK THE OTHER CENTERS ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY SENATOR MEANT. I JUST WANTED TO ECHO- SOME OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID. I SUPPORT THE THEORY OF YOU SEE PRIME BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO JUDGE THIS FROM ANY KIND OF COST BENEFIT STANDPOINT WITHOUT FOR ADDITIONAL DATA ON HOW LONG PEOPLE. ARE STAYING THESE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TARGETED- WHAT THE SUCCESS RATE IS UNLIKE WHY SO WITH THAT GETTING THAT DATA THIS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SENATOR TROUBLED. IN THIS AD COMMENTS ON THAT END AS WELL- TWO QUESTIONS HERE. ONE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHAT PROMPTED THE INCLUSION OF NEW PRIME PROGRAMS- AT THIS TIME AND NUMBER TWO IN THE UC SHARE WHY THEY'RE NO CAN- NO CONSIDERATION CONSISTENT REPORTING ON PRIME OUTCOMES THE UC COLLECT DATA FOR REPORTING PRIME OUTCOMES. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL FIELD THE FIRST PART AND THEN MY COLLEAGUES FROM USED YOU CAN FOLLOW UP ON THE DATA THAT THE UC'S ARE PROPOSAL STEMS. FROM FROM TWO AREAS REALLY ONE IS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON. EQUITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION BUT ALSO EQUITY IN PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH OUTCOMES THIS IS A TARGETED APPROACH TO TRAIN. OUR THROUGH THE PRIME PROGRAM WHICH IS- PROVEN THROUGH VARIOUS. TARGETED TARGETED WAYS TO REACH SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHICALLY UNDER RESOURCE. COMMUNITIES B. THE THIS PART OF THE OTHER ORIGINS OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS THAT THIS WAS A- ARE A PRIORITY FROM THE UC. AND SO WE ARE PROPOSING- OUR OWN VERSION WHICH IS ALMOST IDENTICAL AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY- THEY WERE RECOGNIZING WE ARE WE ARE TOGETHER WITH THE UC ON ON PRIORITIZING THIS ISSUE. OF GRADUATE MEDICAL MEDICAL EDUCATION SO THAT. PEOPLE CAN BE TRAINED AND THEN SERVE UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE- LAST YEAR THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET. PROVIDED A UC RIVERSIDE ALSO IN THE FRESNO AREA THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF THAT INTEREST SO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER PIECE HERE. THANK YOU SAVOR CANNON FOR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHAT HAPPENED TO DEVELOP METRICS FOR REPORTING ON THE SUCCESS OF THE PRIME PROGRAMS WE DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE DATA- SUGGESTED BY THE L. A. O. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TRACK OUR STUDENTS BY THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AFTER THEY GRADUATE- PLACEMENT DATA IS. DEPENDENT ON US KNOWING WHERE THEIR RESIDENCY WAS AND THE STUDENTS SELF REPORTING BUT THERE'S A LOT OF DATA THAT WE COULD REPORT ON REGARDING OUR GRADUATION RATES RETENTION RATES OF WHO ISN'T WHO IS ENROLLED IN THE PRIME PROGRAMS AND WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR RESIDENCY. OF PLACEMENT SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU OF WHAT THE COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE DOC REPORT- I DO WANT TO ALSO COMMENT THAT MEDICAL SCHOOLS UNLIKE ALL OTHER GRADUATE EDUCATION. I HAVE SEPARATE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS- WHERE THE NUMBER OF ENROLLED STUDENTS ARE IS ACTUALLY DIRECTED UP TO THE SCHOOL AND HAS TO BE ON THAT THOUGHT FEDERAL. NATIONAL BOARD HAS TO BE NOTIFIED- OF THE ENROLLMENT- INTENT OF THE SCHOOL AND WE- MUST PROVE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO CORRECT AND TAKE IN A CLASS AND FULLY GRADUATE THAT CLASS BEFORE WE CAN EVER ENROLL THEM. SO THERE ARE SOME UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS ON MEDICAL SCHOOLS THAT DON'T EXIST FOR OTHER TYPES. OF PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS THANK YOU. THANK WANNA COME THAT I A VERY MUCH OF THE PRO. WE I ACTUALLY UCR'S ADDITION TO MY DISTRICT AND SO I AM VERY VERY PRIVY TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE. HAVE A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS- IN OUR IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND- SO I AM VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROGRAM- SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE IT. THE COMPLETE YOUR QUESTIONS- AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOB WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ITEM SIX DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS TO THIS ITEM ALL INTRODUCED THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE RANDY CAT SCAN IN A DRASTIC QUALITY COMPONENT. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OR ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS. THIS IS IN RECOGNITION TO UC'S BACKLOG OF NEED. SO ALL ALL OR CALL ON MY COLLEAGUES RANDY KATZ TO TAKE UP THE CAPITAL ALLEY HE'S HERE. HELLO FROM LARGER ANY CATS OF THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. SO EACH ARM EACH YEAR AS THE- WATSON NOTICE. ON A FINANCE PRODUCES A LONER PROMOTE AND FINAL LETTER. ALL MUCH SHARE OF YOU SEE SUPPORT BUDGET CAN BE FOR OUTLAY YOU SEE SUBMITS THE REPORT EACH SEPTEMBER THIS YEAR THERE'S BEEN TWO- ONE IS AN INFORMATIONAL REQUEST REGARDING- YOU SEEM SAID MEDICAL CENTER AND THE OTHER ONE'S A SEISMIC. RETROFIT HE'S. WE'RE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS AFTER THE OTHERS HAVE GONE. WE. I THINK THAT THE UC YOU'VE AHEAD- THANK YOU CANNOT READY TO OF CALIFORNIA- THE GOVERNOR INVESTMENT OF HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY PROJECTS THAT WILL ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO ADDRESS CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND INCREASED LOCAL EMPLOYMENT. EVERY UC CAMPUS WILL RECEIVE A PORTION OF THESE FUNDS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIED. FOR INTEGRATED CAPITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OR I CAN'T THAT ARE HIGH PRIORITY TO CAMPUSES OR THAT CAN PROVIDE ENERGY EFFICIENCIES WE ESTIMATE THAT THESE PROJECTS CAN BE INITIATED WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND THAT'S PROVIDE LOCAL EMPLOYMENT THAT I ALREADY REFERENCED- TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS IN THE AGENDA THE UC REGENTS DID ASK FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS. WERE VERY GRATEFUL PART THE GOVERNOR GAVE US- WE SELECTED THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BASED ON THE PROJECTS THAT COULD BE INITIATED WITHIN SIX MONTHS SO IF THE LEGISLATURE DID HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO DISTRIBUTE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THOSE AND GET GOING ON THE PROJECTS VERY QUICKLY- WE DON'T SEE ANY ISSUES WITH THE REPORTING ON THE LIST OF PROJECTS THAT WAS REQUESTED IN THE AGENDA- AND IN TERMS OF- EXISTING ENERGY EFFICIENCY. PROJECTS THE UNIVERSITY HAS- WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE CARBON NEUTRALITY INITIATIVE WHICH SET THE GOAL FOR YOU SEE TREMENDOUS ZERO GREENHOUSE GASES FROM OUR BUILDINGS AND VEHICLE FLEET BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. IN ALIGNMENT WITH THIS GOAL THE CAMPUS FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLANS HAVE BEGUN TO PRESENT PROJECTS THAT IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND PROMOTE CLEAN ENERGY- ALSO SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE YEARS HE HAS BEEN A PARTNER WITH CALIFORNIA UTILITIES DO ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS ON OUR CAMPUSES AND THROUGH THIS PARTNERSHIP WE RECEIVED BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY DO ENERGY UPGRADES ON OUR CAMPUSES- AND WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK. YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO WE THINK THAT THE MAINTENANCE IS YOU CAN USE OF TIME FOR- WE RECOMMEND YOU CONSIDER THE PURPOSE FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE HAS STARTING. OUT WE EVEN THINK I YOU REVIEW OTHER ONE TIME BUDGET PROPOSALS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IF YOU FIND ANYTHING THAT'S LOWER PRIORITY THIS WOULD BE A GOOD CANDIDATE TO- REDIRECT FUNDS AND FORTY RECOVERY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. DOING SO WOULD HELP IMPROVE BOTH UC'S AND THE STATE'S BUDGET RESILIENCY IN THE COMING YEARS. WE DO RECOMMEND ONE MODIFICATION- TO THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT AFFECTS THE PROCESS OF ONE THAT PROJECTS TO BE APPROVED. UNDER THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE WHICH PROJECTS. ARE IT WOULD SUPPORT THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE FUNDS ARE RELEASED. AND ARE PROPOSED RECKON A MODIFICATION IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GET THIS LIST OF PROJECTS THREE DAYS BEFORE THE FUNDS ARE RELEASED THIS WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE TIME TO REVIEW THE PROPOSED PROJECTS. AND IT'S ALSO BE MORE CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE STATE HAS FUNDED OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN PREVIOUS YEARS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ARE NONE THE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M GOING TO MOVE ON I NORMALLY WOULD HAVE ASKED YOU A QUESTION BUT- WERE GIVEN VERY SHORT TO APPRECIATE THAT WILL NOT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL TRY TO ADDRESS THEM BEFORE THE MAY REVISE REMOVED ITEM NUMBER SEVEN VARIOUS GOVERNMENT PROPOSED. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS AND BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES WELL NEEDS VARIOUS PROPOSALS START WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET PROPOSES ONE MILLION ON KEEPING GENERAL FUND FOR THE UC TO ADOPT A COMMON LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT ALIGNS WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO SO BY THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR ACADEMIC YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OR CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. ARE YOU SEE FACULTY AND THAT'S THE FOCUS ON- ONLINE RELATED TECHNOLOGY AN IMPROVING ONLINE LEARNING. THE GOVERNOR'S ALSO PROPOSES TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OR TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR SCIENCE AND INNOVATION THIS WOULD PROVIDE STIPENDS FOR STUDENTS OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND FOSTER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN. UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES AND INDUSTRY EMPLOYERS SO THAT'S GETTING TO REGARD BIGGER THEME OF ALIGNING HIGHER EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE. THE THERE ARE TWO OTHER OPTIONS. THIS IS HERE BOTHOF THESE NEXT ONES WERE WERE ORIGINATED WITH THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT WE'RE CALLING THEM OUT HERE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BECAUSE THAT THE AMOUNTS ARE JUST SO THAT WE CAN CLEARLY ANNOUNCED WHAT- WHAT IS BEING BUDGET FROM UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. SO IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE POINT TWO MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES FOR FACULTY STAFF AND ORIGINATED WITH THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT- SO DID THE FIREARMS OF VIOLENCE RESEARCH. IT INVESTMENT WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I INCLUDES ONE MILLION ON GOING TO SUPPORT THIS THIS IS A UC DAVIS FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR OUR VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS ARE VARIOUS PROPOSALS. THAT THEY WERE COMING TOGETHER HERE IN THE AGENDA AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON ANY OF THOSE PERFECT ARM UC. FAVOR CANNON FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHERE PEOPLE THAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO INVEST IN YOU SEE STUDENTS AND RESEARCH- IF THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL TO SAY WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THESE ITEMS. EXCEPT WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. FOR THE SAKE OF TIME ALL FOCUS MY CONCERN MIGHT. ON THE LARGEST PROPOSAL IN THIS ISSUE WHICH IS THAT. CLOSE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. FOR THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR SCIENCE AND INNOVATION. AND HERE WE HAVE A FEW CORE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL THE FIRST IS BASED ON PRELIMINARY INFORMATION WE'VE SEEN FROM THE UNIVERSITY AND HOW WOULD SPEND THE FARMS. THE IMPACT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE VERY ON EURO SUPPORTING ABOUT FIVE FIVE HUNDRED FORTY- RESEARCHERS AND STUDENTS THAT YOU SEE ANNUALLY OR TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED STICK- INDIVIDUALS OVER THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD. IN A NARROW SUBSET. OF INDUSTRIES CALIFORNIA. OUR SECOND IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PROVIDED- A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE STATE WORKFORCE NEEDS. AND ABSENT THAT BROADER ANALYSIS IT'S DIFFICULT TO GAUGE WHETHER ABOUT- PROPOSED ACTIVITIES OPPOSE INDUSTRIES THAT WOULD BE TARGETED WITH THESE FARMS REFLECT THE STATE'S HIGHEST WORKFORCE PRIORITIES. AND IN THIRD THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SIGNALED TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT IT INTENDS TO SUBMIT ANOTHER WORKFORCE PROPOSAL TOTALING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. ANDREW THIS IS A DIFFERENT PROPOSAL- THE ADMINISTRATION STATES THAT IT'S INTENT FOR HIS FORTHCOMING PROPOSAL IS TO ALIGN HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITH WORKFORCE NEEDS THAT'S THE SAME OBJECTIVE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CITES FOR THIS PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE HAS LITTLE INFORMATION AS TO HOW THESE PROPOSALS INTERACT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS A FEW OPTIONS FOR THIS PROPOSAL. ONE IS TO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE A STRONGER PROPOSAL THAT FROM BETTER JUSTIFIES WHY IT'S PROPOSAL IS REFLECTING AMONG THE STATE'S HIGHEST WORKFORCE PRIORITIES. ALTERNATELY LEGISLATURE CAN- WITHHOLD MAKING A DECISION FOR THIS- OTHER OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL. REVIEW BOTH AS A PACKAGE AND SEE HOW IT AND SEE HOW THEY INTERACT AND SEE WHICH ONES MIGHT BE THE- HIGHEST PRIORITY. OR ALTERNATIVELY LEGISLATURE COULD READ THIS BILL. IN REDIRECT BOB FUNDING FOR OTHER ONE PURCHASE AND- AS I KNOW THAT THIS IS BE THE EXAM SORT OF AND IN THE LAST ITEM. CORRECT THE FUNDS FOR SUPPORTING MORTGAGE FOR MAINTENANCE. WHERE WILL THE OBJECTIVES OF THE LOT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THEY WOULD BE MORE CONNECTED TO ADDRESSING BUDGET RESILIENCY FOR THE STATE AND THE UNIVERSITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OF THE SUB COMMITTEE RECEIVED A CONCERN FROM A STAKEHOLDER WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE LMS PROPOSAL BEING A NO BID CONTRACT. GIVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BAKER CLERK AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE WOULD KNOW THE PERSPECTIVES A LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. IS SPECIFIC TO A COMMON INTERSEGMENT FOR LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT ALIGNS WITH THE SYSTEM USED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE THANK YOUS OF A SINGLE LEARNING MANAGEMENT PLATFORM AT CREATIVE STREAMLINING AND SAVINGS YEAH COMPANIES OF SCALE. THE GOVERNOR'SBUDGET PROPOSAL FOR YOU SEE AND ALSO FOR CSU TO USE THE SAME COMMON PLATFORM AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WHAT OFFER TRANSFER STUDENTS AND OTHER STUDENTS TO TAKE COURSES ACROSS MULTIPLE CAMPUSES HAVE AN EASIER TIME TRANSITIONING ACROSS INSTITUTIONS AND FROM SEMESTER TO SEMESTER.
