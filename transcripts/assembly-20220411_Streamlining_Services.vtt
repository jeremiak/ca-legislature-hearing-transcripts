PERCENT OF THEM WERE FEMALE

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.419
PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE AND ONLY

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:01.987
ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FACT

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:04.223
AND EATING AT WORK TRAFFIC TO

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.592

OTHER COUNTRIES AND IT'S

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.832
ASSEMBLY DIFFERENTLY WHEN WE

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:15.134
LOOK AT CHILD LABOR TRAFFICKING

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:17.303
VICTIMS OVER HALF OF THE VICTIMS

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:20.039
WERE MALE AND AND SO

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.740
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DIFFERENCE

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:24.009
THERE I'M THIRTY PERCENT OF

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.144
THE VICTIMS WERE TRAFFICKED

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:27.379
ARE SOMEWHAT MORE LIKELY TO BE

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:30.082
TRAFFICKED WITH AN ADULT AND

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:32.685
THEN -- ROUGHLY HALF

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:34.453
OF THE FACT THAT WERE CITIZENS

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.722
OF EITHER COUNTRY I'M SO

00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:37.923
I'M A PRETTY BIG DIFFERENCE

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.492
FOR THE SEX TRAFFICKING VICTIMS

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:41.060
TEND TO BE MORE FEMALE AND ARE

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:42.595
MORE LIKELY TO BE YOU ACCESS

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:44.897
AND OR PERMANENT LEGAL RESIDENTS

00:12:45.364 --> 00:12:46.532
AND LABOR TRAFFICKING THAT

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.868
SOUNDS CUTE MORE AND MORE

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:51.504
PREDOMINANTLY MALE ARCHITECTS

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.938
TO TRAFFIC TO WARRANT MORE SO

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:54.974
WITH AN ADULT I'M AND MUCH MORE

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.243
LIKELY TO BE I'M NOT A U. S.

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:00.513
IN ADDITION ON IN THIS

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:01.914
PARTICULAR DATA SET THAT WE

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:03.582
LOOK AT ROUGHLY FIVE PERCENT

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:05.618
OF THE VICTIMS WERE REPORTEDLY

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:11.790
COMPARISON AND INTERACTION

00:13:11.857 --> 00:13:13.993
BETWEEN THESE TWO I THINK IT'S

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:15.528
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT CHILDREN

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:18.097
THAT ARE TRAFFICKED FOR LABOUR

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:20.032
MIGHT ALSO BE MORE VULNERABLE

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.867
TO SEXUAL ABUSE EVEN AFTER

TRAFFICKED OR EXPLOITED FOR

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:27.206
THOSE PURPOSES JUST CERTAINLY

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:28.741
ANY CHILD WHO'S BEING TRAFFICKED

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.142

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:32.711

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:44.390
WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE HOLD

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:47.927
PERPETRATORS AT THIS CRANE SO

00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:51.297
ON AND SO WHEN WE LOOK

00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:54.333
AT X. TRAFFICKING

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:56.702
WORK HE SAID INVOLVES

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:59.438

EXPOSED TO ESPECIALLY A CHILD

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.882
BECAUSE I WAS TRAPPED I WAS

OLDER AND SEE SAID MOST FAMILIES

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:11.896
WERE OFF THE TABLE I WANT TO

WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR OWN MONEY

00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:29.980

KIDS GROUP HOMES ARE

00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:50.935
CRAZY BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T

MANY FIGHTS THAT WERE HAPPENING

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.271
INSIDE THE HOUSE SOMETIMES IT

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:56.473
WAS SAFER TO BE OUTSIDE I

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.875

WORDS THEY WERE THEY WERE KIND

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:08.185

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.025
EIGHTEEN I WANTED TO GO TO

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:24.802
BACK TO WHAT I KNEW BEST THE

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:27.204
GAME SO WHEN I GOT APPROVED FOR

NO NOT ACCOMPLI SOMETHING WAS

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:38.215

OF ANXIETY WHICH CAME OUT AS

00:43:48.859 --> 00:43:51.395
ANGER A LOT SO THE FIRST

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:52.730
TIME SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.331
TO ME THAT WAS TRIGGERING A

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:57.067

EXISTING MAKING ME VULNERABLE

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:16.420
ENOUGH TO GO BACK TO THE GAME

ACROSS THE STATE HISTORICALLY

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:56.558
UNDERFUNDED AND PARTICULARLY

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:57.792
IN RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE

01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.561
LACK OF ACCESS RESOURCES TO

SUPPORT SURVIVORS EVEN IF

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:02.363
THEY'RE IDENTIFIED IN THE DO

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:03.898

FAMILY AND CAREGIVER SUPPORTS

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:10.872

TRAFFICKING SITUATIONS MAY

01:25:13.808 --> 01:25:14.709
NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.244
THEY NEED TO SUPPORT THEIR USE

01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:18.580
AND TO SUPPORT THEIR CAT --

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:21.749
AND -- DIVERSE POPULATIONS

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:23.952
ARE OF PARTICULAR VULNERABILITY

01:25:24.018 --> 01:25:25.286
FOR EXAMPLE L. G. B. T.

01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:27.989
Q. I. A TWO AT TWO SPIRIT

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:30.391

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:39.767
LACK OF RESOURCES FOR

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:43.004
-- IT BECOMES REALLY NEW ONES

01:25:43.071 --> 01:25:44.339
WHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:45.840
CHILD LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS

01:25:45.907 --> 01:25:47.375
AS WELL AS I MENTIONED THEY

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:48.476
MAY FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW

01:25:48.543 --> 01:25:49.577
OF THE COLLECTION ABUSE BUT

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:50.645
THAT DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:52.680
INDICATE A MANDATED REPORTER

01:25:52.914 --> 01:25:54.148

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:57.218

ME TO THE GOOD WORK OF DIGNITY

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.341
AND AND THE WORK THAT YOU'RE

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:03.011
DOING AND WHAT I HOPE FOR IS

01:28:03.077 --> 01:28:05.079
THAT -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:06.881
CATCHES THE ATTENTION OF ALL

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:08.449
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN THE

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:09.550
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD

01:28:09.617 --> 01:28:11.252
REALLY BE INTERESTED TO HEAR

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:13.054
IS THERE A CONCERN OF EFFORT

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:15.189
TO BE ABLE TO COLLABORATE --

01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:16.791
BETWEEN HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

01:28:16.858 --> 01:28:18.259
THROUGHOUT THE STATE --

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:20.928
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY -- DIGNITY AS

01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:23.231
AS -- AS GREAT OF A WORK THAT

01:28:23.297 --> 01:28:25.400
YOU'RE DOING -- YOUR RESOURCES

01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:26.968
ARE LIMITED SO TO BE ABLE TO

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:28.636
COLLABORATE WITH OTHER HEALTH

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:29.971
CARE PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:32.240
THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY DOING --

01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:33.808
COLLECTING DATA IN A CONSISTENT

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:35.376
WAY BUT WE'RE PROVIDING HEALTH

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:36.911
CARE IN A CONSISTENT WAY AS

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.379
WELL THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:41.416
STATE AND I WAS -- REALLY

01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:43.785
-- -- SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:46.454
SPEND KNOWN OR UNDERSTOOD BUT

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:48.423
-- I HAD MENTIONED IN A PREVIOUS

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:50.992
PANEL ABOUT BEING PROACTIVE

01:28:51.059 --> 01:28:52.326
AND NOT WAITING FOR VICTIMS TO

01:28:52.393 --> 01:28:53.895
COME OUT AND AND GET HELP BUT

01:28:53.961 --> 01:28:55.296
ACTUALLY SEARCHING OUT THOSE

01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:56.931
VICTIMS WHERE THEY ARE BECAUSE

01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:58.966
WE KNOW AT LEAST IT MAY BE

01:28:59.033 --> 01:29:01.502
AT A TOTAL -- IN A SCIENTIFIC

01:29:01.569 --> 01:29:03.638
SENSE BUT WE KNOW THERE ARE A

01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:05.506
LOT OF VICTIMS OUT THERE THAT

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:07.575
ARE NOT REPORTING THAT ARE NOT

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:09.711
COMING OUT AND AND SEEKING THE

01:29:09.777 --> 01:29:10.578
HELP THAT THEY NEED BUT THEY

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:13.081
HOLD THEM FOR A LIFETIME AND

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:14.682
IT ALWAYS MANIFEST IN OTHER

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:17.351
WAYS AND LIFE SO WITH THAT I

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:18.619
-- I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY

01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:20.121
INTERESTING THAT ONE OF THOSE

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.622
STARTING POINTS IS ACTUALLY

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:23.191
REACHING OUT TO HOMELESS YOUTH

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:24.826
FINDING THE HOMELESS YOUTH ON

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:26.461
THE STREETS AND THEM MAKING

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:28.463
SERVICES AVAILABLE AND TO

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:30.965
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY BEGAN TO

01:29:31.232 --> 01:29:32.734
BUILD SOMETHING THEY'VE NEVER

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.469
EXPANSION FOR THAT STRESSED

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:37.438
AND THEIR LIFE AND TRUST HEELS

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:39.340
AND TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IT

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:41.075
OPENS UP THINGS AS WELL MORE

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:42.810
THAN TO BE ABLE TO HEAL AND THE

01:29:42.877 --> 01:29:44.011
OTHER THING THAT REALLY BROUGHT

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:45.847
A LOT OF CONCERN TO ME IS THAT

01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:47.515
I THINK I'M HEARING A MESSAGE

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:49.450
THAT'S REALLY RESOUNDING AND

01:29:49.517 --> 01:29:51.452
THAT IS IN MANY CASES THROUGHOUT

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:53.321
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REALLY

01:29:53.387 --> 01:29:55.022
THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO DEAL

01:29:55.089 --> 01:29:57.024
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:29:57.091 --> 01:29:59.360
IN THIS CRISIS IS THROUGH OUR

01:29:59.427 --> 01:30:01.295
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ARE YOUTH

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:03.598
ARE ARE ARE USED JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:30:03.664 --> 01:30:05.366
AND THAT HAS BECOME KIND OF

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:08.169
THE THE LANDING SPOT BECAUSE

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:09.837
OF THE FACT THAT WE STRUGGLE

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:12.340
YEAH AND AND AND RESOURCES

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:14.776
AND OTHER OTHER AREAS SO

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:16.878
IF IF THERE IS A FAMILY JUSTICE

01:30:16.944 --> 01:30:18.679
CENTER OR THERE IS A HEALTH CARE

01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:21.382
PROVIDER OR OR THEY ARE CAUGHT

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:22.784
OUT ON THE STREETS AND HIT A

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:25.019
HOMELESS SITUATION AND THOSE

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:26.554
RESOURCES ARE LACKING OR THE

01:30:26.621 --> 01:30:28.823
LACK OF EDUCATION TO WHATEVER

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:30.925
AGENCY IS FINDING THEM THEY

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:32.493
JUST END UP GETTING PUT INTO A

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.262
PIPELINE OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:30:34.462 --> 01:30:35.863
AND THEN WE REALLY LOSE AT THAT

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:38.132
POINT SO WITH THAT I DO WANT

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:40.201

JUST MAKES ONE WONDER HOW

02:06:26.078 --> 02:06:28.280
MUCH OF THIS CRISIS COULD BE

02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:30.916
AVOIDED BY JUST TAKING TIME TO

02:06:50.235 --> 02:06:51.904
AS AS IT GOES BACK TO THAT OLD

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:54.039
SAYING AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION

02:06:54.106 --> 02:06:55.541
IS BETTER THAN A POUND OF CURE

02:06:56.008 --> 02:06:58.310
AND REALLY IT'S INCUMBENT ON

02:06:58.377 --> 02:07:00.346
OUR SOCIETY IT'S INCUMBENT UPON

02:07:00.412 --> 02:07:02.948
ALL OF US AS A COMMUNITY TO

02:07:03.015 --> 02:07:05.084

THAT BAD OR ADVERSE BEHAVIOR

02:07:19.498 --> 02:07:21.567
AND TO GET DOWN TO THE ROOT

02:07:21.633 --> 02:07:23.102
OF IT AND ACTUALLY LISTEN TO

02:07:23.168 --> 02:07:25.471
