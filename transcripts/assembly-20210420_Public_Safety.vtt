00:46:22.412 --> 00:46:24.781
APPROPRIATE SENTENCE THIS BILL

00:46:24.848 --> 00:46:26.450
WOULD REQUIRE THE COURT TO

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:28.185
IMPOSE A LOWER TERM WHERE

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:30.220

TRAFFICKING OR INTIMATE PARTNER

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:34.925
VIOLENCE WHAT THE CONTRIBUTING

00:46:34.992 --> 00:46:35.726
FACTOR IN THE COMMISSION OF THE

00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:38.328
OFFENSE. HOWEVER IT IS UNCLEAR

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:40.497
WHAT EVIDENCE IS SUFFICIENT TO

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:42.266
PROVE ONE OF THESE FACTORS

00:46:42.332 --> 00:46:44.034
WHETHER IN FACT A CONTRIBUTING

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.702
FACTOR AND WHETHER IT WAS A

00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:47.671
MINOR OR MAJOR CONTRIBUTING

00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:50.174
FACTOR. IF THE COURT REQUIRED

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.876
TO IMPOSE A LOWER TERMS IF IT

00:46:52.943 --> 00:46:54.144

00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:56.613
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THIS BILL

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.315
WOULD ALSO EXTEND HUMAN

TO SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES I

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:04.521
WOULD CREATE A NEW AFFIRMATIVE

00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:06.523
DEFENSE FOR VICTIMS OF INTIMATE

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:07.925

HARM THE FEAR NEED NOT BE

00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:30.447
SERIOUS NOR VIOLENT THIS IS

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:32.416
VERY CONCERNING BECAUSE THIS

00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:34.318

DEFENSE TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO

00:47:40.357 --> 00:47:41.959

CONTRIBUTING FACTOR OF THEIR

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.595
CRIME. INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMIT

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:20.130
CRIMES MAY SEE THIS AS AN

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:21.865
OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST A

EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MENTAL

STOPPER GENERAL INTENT CRIMES

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.265
THIS IS A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:31.301
LAW THAT UNDERCUTS DECADES OF

WILL NOT BE PROSECUTED OR WILL

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:49.453
RECEIVE A LESSER SENTENCE FOR

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:51.388
COMMITTING A CRIME. A BIT MAY

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:53.056
BE MORE LIKELY TO UTILIZE THEIR

CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU- SO I

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:59.416
HEARD THE OPPOSITION- MOST OF

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:02.152
IT I DON'T THINK. IS TERRIBLY

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:03.920
CONVINCING I MEAN THEY'RE

00:52:03.987 --> 00:52:05.322
THEY'RE ALREADY USING THESE

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:10.026
POOR CHILDREN AS- TO DO ALL THE

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:12.562
THINGS THAT THE OPPOSITION SAID

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:13.129
I MEAN I DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:16.666
GOING TO CHANGE- AND WHILE THEY

00:52:16.733 --> 00:52:19.169
SAY THAT THERE IS- WASTE

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:21.805
CONSIDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES

THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT BEING

CONSIDERED. SO I THINK THE BILL

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:28.144
IS URGENT AND NEEDED. THE ONE

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:30.113

EITHER NOW OR IN YOUR CLOTHES.

00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:42.859
BUT THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:40.216
BECAUSE I THINK THE ASSUMPTION

00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:41.418
IS THAT THEY WOULD BE UTILIZING

00:53:41.484 --> 00:53:42.652
PUBLIC DEFENDERS IT'S ALSO

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:44.220
REALLY EXPENSIVE TO HAVE-

00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:46.723
PRIVATE COUNSEL FOR THIS- AND

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.425
AS I MENTIONED. THERE WOULD BE

00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:50.126
THRESHOLDS THAT HAVE TO BE MET

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:52.095

FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN MISS

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:03.373
SKINNER'S BILL- ABOUT FELONY

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.175
MURDER THERE WAS STILL A

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:07.744
THRESHOLD THAT HAD TO BE MET-

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:09.613
FOR CONSIDERATION FOR THOSE-

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:12.649
BUT JEREMY THORTON IF YOU'RE ON

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:13.183

00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:15.752
ELABORATE. YES THANK YOU

CONTENTIONS FROM THE

00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:25.662
OPPOSITION- LAW EXPERTS COULD

00:54:25.729 --> 00:54:28.531
CERTAINLY BE USED- TO ADDRESS

00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:30.734
THESE- FACTORS IN THE

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.068
CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING THE

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:33.837
CONDITION AND WHETHER OR NOT IT

00:54:33.903 --> 00:54:35.505
WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THAT

00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:38.842
IS NOT THE SOLE WAY TO DO IT

00:54:38.908 --> 00:54:40.377
AND FRANKLY THAT MAY NOT EVEN

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:42.312
BE THE FIRST WAY THAT DEFENSE

CAN THE STAFF WAS THE LEVEL.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.296
THE EXISTENCE OF THE CONDITION-

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:00.897
THAT FALLS WITHIN ONE OF THE

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:03.700
CIRCUMSTANCES- ALSO INTERVIEWS

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:33.029
THINGS LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:55:33.096 --> 00:55:35.865
SEXUAL ABUSE- SO THOSE ARE

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:37.667
PEOPLE WHO WILL BE INTERVIEWED.

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:39.069

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:50.447
EVIDENCE- AND FRANKLY MOST OF

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:52.382
THIS IS ALREADY DONE. THIS KIND

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:54.017
OF MITIGATION IS NOT UNCOMMON

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:56.820
IN OUR PRACTICE IT'S JUST THAT

00:55:56.886 --> 00:55:58.121
THE QUESTION IS HOW IS THIS

00:55:58.188 --> 00:55:59.989
MEDICATION USED BY THE DISTRICT

00:56:00.056 --> 00:56:02.759

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.229
HOW THIS MEDICATION SHOULD BE

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:10.333
USED AND- WHAT THE PURPOSES- I

00:56:14.738 --> 00:56:16.973
WAS- THE IDEA OF- CONTRIBUTING

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.742
FACTOR AND WHETHER OR NOT WE

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:20.844
NEED EXPERTS TO PROVE THAT AND

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.778
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:23.646
COURTS WILL DO AND THAT THE

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:24.748
COURTS WILL ADDRESS THAT

00:56:24.814 --> 00:56:25.582
THEY'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:29.052
STANDARD. AND CAN CERTAINLY. A

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:32.455

OFFER THE DEFENSE POLICE

00:56:44.834 --> 00:56:46.236
REPORTS THAT INDICATE THE

00:56:46.302 --> 00:56:49.572
CLIENT WAS A VICTIM- BUT THAT'S

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:52.108
JUST KIND OF. THE NATURE OF DUE

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:53.877
PROCESS IS WHEN THERE IS

00:56:53.943 --> 00:56:55.812
MITIGATING EVIDENCE OUT THERE

00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:57.347
PROSECUTORS HAVE A DUTY TO TURN

00:56:57.413 --> 00:56:59.082

RIGHT NOW DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:24.340
OFFICES ARE ACTUALLY

00:57:24.407 --> 00:57:25.208

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:38.588
BILL BEFORE SO I DON'T KNOW IF

00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:39.489
THE OPPOSITION LETTER WAS

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:41.090
TALKING ABOUT COSTS IN GENERAL

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:42.992
OR COST OF SELF REFERRALS. BUT

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:44.961

FOCUS ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:58.908

00:58:22.899 --> 00:58:24.000
THE CRIMINALS AND THAT'S PRETTY

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:25.702

00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:30.106

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:31.307
YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A LARGE

00:58:31.374 --> 00:58:33.409

THEMSELVES. THEY GOT THAT WAY

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:51.594
BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA. HOWEVER

00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:52.929
THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM LESS

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:54.931
DANGEROUS TO THE PUBLIC AND IT

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:56.399

00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:36.706
THAT HAVE COME FROM THE

00:59:36.773 --> 00:59:38.107
SURVIVORS AND THINKING OF THE

00:59:38.174 --> 00:59:40.176
STORY OF KIANA ALDRICH IT WAS

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:43.212
NOT JUST THAT SHE WAS- SEXUALLY

00:59:43.279 --> 00:59:44.814
ABUSED AND THAT SHE WAS

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.950
TRAFFICKED. BUT SHE ALSO HAD A

00:59:47.016 --> 00:59:49.719
HISTORY OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA AND

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:50.920

DESERVE TO HAVE TAKEN INTO

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.297
CONSIDERATION I WOULD JUST LIKE

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:03.032
TO REITERATE THAT THIS BILL.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.734
PROVIDES INFORMATION TO THE

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:07.437
COURTS. SO THAT JUDGES ARE ABLE

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:09.772
TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.040
AND ARE ABLE TO TAKE INTO

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:13.142
CONSIDERATION THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:14.143
THAT LED TO THE CRIMINAL

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.979
BEHAVIOR AND MANY INSTANCES

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:18.381
THAT IS NOT ALLOWED. THE BURDEN

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.249
IS STILL AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:23.953
REMAIN. WITH THE DEFENSE. THE

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.956
BURDEN IS STILL ON THE DEFENSE.

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:28.925
AND THE DISCRETION STILL LIES

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:31.461
WITH THE JUDGE IN ALL OF THOSE

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:33.763
THINGS STILL REMAIN. THIS JUST

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.799
ALLOWS FOR THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:40.103
TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:42.805
IT KIANA AS STORY. AND

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:44.807
RESENTENCING SHOULD HAVE

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:47.710
ALLOWED THE JUDGE TO RECOGNIZE

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:49.579
AND CONSIDER THE FACT THAT SHE

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:53.182
WAS BOUGHT. THAT SHE WAS BOUGHT

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:55.852
AND THAT SHE WAS USED. AND IT

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:57.086
DOESN'T DENY THE CRIMINAL

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.055
BEHAVIOR THAT SHE WAS INVOLVED

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:02.158
IN. BUT IT CERTAINLY PLAYS A

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.794
ROLE AND WHY THAT BEHAVIOR

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:07.030
HAPPENED AND THAT IS ALL THIS

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:09.599
BILL IS ASKING US TO CONSIDER I

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:10.867

HOLDS ARE THE STANDARD

01:57:26.439 --> 01:57:28.708
PROCEDURE BECAUSE SO MANY CASES

01:57:55.735 --> 01:57:56.869
MENTION THAT IS BECAUSE BASED

RE HOME CORRECT. IT WOULD BE IN

01:58:02.141 --> 01:58:03.109
MOST CASES IT WOULD REQUIRE

01:58:03.176 --> 01:58:04.644

REQUIRE JUDGES PROBATION OUT OF

WITH MY COLLEAGUE MISTER KIRK

02:57:50.092 --> 02:57:52.995
WHICH IS- I MEAN I DO BELIEVE

02:57:53.062 --> 02:57:54.163
THAT GIVING JUDICIAL

02:57:54.230 --> 02:57:56.632
DESTRUCTION TO DECIDE WHAT IS

02:57:56.699 --> 02:57:57.566
APPROPRIATE IS WHAT WE DO EVERY

02:57:57.633 --> 02:57:59.869
DAY ROOMS AND WHEN IT COMES TO

02:57:59.935 --> 02:58:02.038
SENTENCING AND SAID THAT I

02:58:02.104 --> 02:58:03.773
DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH I

02:58:03.839 --> 02:58:04.607
DON'T KNOW WHY SPECIAL

02:58:04.673 --> 02:58:06.175
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DIFFERENCE

02:58:06.242 --> 02:58:07.810
AND THAT THE JUDGE WE CAN TRUST

02:58:07.877 --> 02:58:09.245
JUDGES EVERY DAY TO DECIDE WHAT

02:58:09.311 --> 02:58:10.513
THE APPROPRIATE SENTENCES. BUT

02:58:10.579 --> 02:58:11.814
I AGREE WITH MR QUIRK THAT THE

02:58:11.881 --> 02:58:13.883
SECTION THAT TALKS ABOUT IF THE

02:58:13.949 --> 02:58:15.151
OFFENSE WAS COMMITTED TWENTY

02:58:15.217 --> 02:58:16.152
YEARS OR MORE BEFORE THERE'S

02:58:16.218 --> 02:58:17.253
BEEN NO ACTIVE ISLANDS AND

02:58:17.319 --> 02:58:18.421
THERE ISN'T A DEFINITION OF

02:58:18.487 --> 02:58:19.755
ACTIVE VIOLENCE EITHER WHICH I

02:58:19.822 --> 02:58:21.424
THINK LEAVES A FAIRLY VAGUE

02:58:21.490 --> 02:58:22.958
CIRCUMSTANCES SAYS IT SHALL BE

02:58:23.025 --> 02:58:24.627
PRESUMED AND THE FINDING WILL

02:58:24.693 --> 02:58:26.929
BE DISMISSED SO I DON'T THINK

02:58:26.996 --> 02:58:28.164
THAT LEAVES DISCRETION TO THE

02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:29.365
COURT TO DISMISS THE SPECIAL

02:58:29.432 --> 02:58:30.366
CIRCUMSTANCES AND I THINK

02:58:30.433 --> 02:58:33.102
THAT'S- PROBLEMATIC. SO I DON'T

02:58:33.169 --> 02:58:34.270

02:58:34.336 --> 02:58:37.239

03:41:53.333 --> 03:41:55.068
ISSUE OF DENYING- VISITATION

03:41:57.971 --> 03:42:01.741
MAMMOTH THE- IF CERTAIN- IF

03:42:01.808 --> 03:42:04.010

PARTICULAR VISITATION RIGHT-

03:42:05.512 --> 03:42:07.213
DURING THE VISIT WHAT WE'RE

03:42:07.280 --> 03:42:08.281
SAYING IS YOU JUST CAN'T TAKE

03:42:08.348 --> 03:42:09.449
IT AWAY FOR EVERYTHING THAT

03:42:09.516 --> 03:42:11.818
HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF THOSE-

03:42:11.885 --> 03:42:12.986
OUTSIDE OF THE VISITATION SO

03:42:13.053 --> 03:42:15.355
LET'S SAY- YOU AND I ARE

03:42:15.422 --> 03:42:16.389
VISITING SOMEBODY OR VISITING

03:42:16.456 --> 03:42:17.924
OURSELVES ONE OF US- IS

03:42:17.991 --> 03:42:19.392
INCARCERATED IF WE DO SOMETHING

03:42:19.459 --> 03:42:20.760
TO VIOLATE THE RULES OF THAT.

03:42:20.827 --> 03:42:22.262
PARTICULAR VISITATION AND THEN

03:42:22.328 --> 03:42:23.196
SIR THEY'RE DISTRIBUTED

03:42:23.263 --> 03:42:24.264
DISCUSSION THERE TO BE ABLE TO

03:42:24.330 --> 03:42:26.366
DO THAT BUT- BECAUSE I HAVE

03:42:26.433 --> 03:42:27.333
MORE THAN FIVE DOLLARS IN MY

03:42:27.400 --> 03:42:30.003
POCKET. AT ANY GIVEN TIME-

03:42:30.070 --> 03:42:31.738
WHILE I AM EXERCISING OR DOING

03:42:31.805 --> 03:42:33.840
SOMETHING ELSE. THAT WOULD BE

03:42:33.907 --> 03:42:34.574
TAKEN OFF LIMITS BECAUSE THEY

03:42:34.641 --> 03:42:36.142
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

03:42:36.209 --> 03:42:37.310
ACTUAL VISITATION WITHIN THE

03:42:37.377 --> 03:42:39.345
CONTEXT OF VISITATION- AND I

03:42:39.412 --> 03:42:40.613
THINK THAT'S WERE THAT'S WHAT

03:42:40.680 --> 03:42:42.449
WE'RE DRAW ON THE LINE AND IN

03:42:42.515 --> 03:42:43.316
REGARDS THIS CONVERSATION

03:42:43.383 --> 03:42:44.517
TODAY. THANK YOU THAT'S VERY

03:42:44.584 --> 03:42:46.953
HELPFUL- HAS THE BILL HAS A

03:42:47.020 --> 03:42:48.688
BEEN A MOTION. RIGHT NOW MOVES

03:42:48.755 --> 03:42:51.191
TO BAIL AND ASKED TO BE ADDED

03:42:51.257 --> 03:42:52.292
TO SCOTT WALKER WITH MY

03:42:52.358 --> 03:42:57.864
PLEASURE. THANK YOU YES. MISS

03:42:57.931 --> 03:43:00.500
BAR K. Q. Q. WITH THE SENATE

03:43:00.567 --> 03:43:05.138
YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I

03:43:05.205 --> 03:43:06.106
THINK THIS REALLY AND I KNOW

03:43:06.172 --> 03:43:07.240
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

03:43:07.307 --> 03:43:08.541
PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THIS HERE

03:43:08.608 --> 03:43:09.576
IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT I DO

03:43:09.642 --> 03:43:10.543
THINK THEY TOUCH ON PUBLIC

03:43:10.610 --> 03:43:12.178
SAFETY I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

03:43:12.245 --> 03:43:12.946
TRYING TO HERE'S REALLY

03:43:13.012 --> 03:43:14.848
CRITICAL I MEAN ALL THE DATA

03:43:14.914 --> 03:43:16.249
IT'S OVERWHELMING TO SHOW THAT

03:43:16.316 --> 03:43:18.184
ALLOWING ACCESS TO ONE'S FAMILY

03:43:18.251 --> 03:43:19.953
IN VISITATION IMPROVES OUTCOMES

03:43:20.019 --> 03:43:21.221
WHEN PEOPLE COME OUT OF JAIL

03:43:21.287 --> 03:43:22.355
AND IT REDUCES RECIDIVISM RATES

03:43:22.422 --> 03:43:23.690
WHICH AGAIN WE SAY EVERY

03:43:23.757 --> 03:43:24.791
HEARING IS ONE OF OUR GOALS AND

03:43:24.858 --> 03:43:26.359
I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY

03:43:26.426 --> 03:43:28.261
IMPORTANT PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE-

03:43:28.328 --> 03:43:29.429
I DO THINK AND I URGE THE

03:43:29.496 --> 03:43:31.431
CHECKS I KNOW HE SAID ON. AND

03:43:31.498 --> 03:43:32.465
THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE THAT

03:43:32.532 --> 03:43:33.666
DEALS WITH THIS THAT WE DON'T

03:43:33.733 --> 03:43:35.735
TAKE RESOURCES IF WE DO THIS

03:43:35.802 --> 03:43:37.137
WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT RESOURCES

03:43:37.203 --> 03:43:38.304
MY FEAR IS IT WILL TAKE

03:43:38.371 --> 03:43:39.572
RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE REST OF

03:43:39.639 --> 03:43:41.207
THE POPULATION AND ALREADY I

03:43:41.274 --> 03:43:43.510
THINK WE ARE UNDER. OUR INMATES

03:43:43.576 --> 03:43:44.644
ARE UNDER CERTAIN ARE GETTING

03:43:44.711 --> 03:43:45.812
THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO

03:43:45.879 --> 03:43:47.213
SUCCEED AND SO I DO THINK IT'S

03:43:47.280 --> 03:43:48.047
CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE A

03:43:48.114 --> 03:43:49.182
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER OR

03:43:49.249 --> 03:43:50.717
NOT THESE ACTIVITIES ARE FUN IS

03:43:50.784 --> 03:43:51.217
THAT WE'RE NOT REDUCING

03:43:51.284 --> 03:43:54.921
SERVICES ELSEWHERE IN ORDER TO

03:43:54.988 --> 03:43:55.421
DO THIS BECAUSE- THAT'S

03:43:55.488 --> 03:43:56.589
CRITICAL IN MAKING SURE THAT

03:43:56.656 --> 03:43:57.657
WE'RE SUCCESSFUL SO I JUST WANT

03:43:57.724 --> 03:44:00.660
TO PUT THAT ON THE TABLE AND- I

03:44:00.727 --> 03:44:01.294
HOPE THAT THE BUDGETS THAT WILL

03:44:01.361 --> 03:44:04.030
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. MRS

03:44:04.097 --> 03:44:07.133
HERE TO THANK YOU EACH. SON OF

03:44:07.200 --> 03:44:08.668
THIS IT MAKES IT A CIVIL RIGHT.

03:44:08.735 --> 03:44:11.604
CORRECT IT MAKES IT WELL WE'RE

03:44:11.671 --> 03:44:12.238
SAYING THAT THERE SHOULD BE A

03:44:12.305 --> 03:44:13.506
RIGHT TO WRITE A BILL SEVERAL

03:44:13.573 --> 03:44:15.608
GRADUAL IT'S A CIVIL RIGHT AS I

03:44:15.675 --> 03:44:17.377
WON YEARS WITH THE RIGHT YES

03:44:17.443 --> 03:44:19.946
OKAY SO UNDER CIVIL RIGHT YOU

03:44:20.013 --> 03:44:22.282
CAN FILE YOUR LAWSUITS. IF

03:44:22.348 --> 03:44:23.116
YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR CIVIL

03:44:23.183 --> 03:44:26.186
RIGHT TO HAVE THIS THIS

03:44:26.252 --> 03:44:28.688
VISITATION. AND WHAT I GUESS

03:44:28.755 --> 03:44:30.857
THE QUESTION COMES IN WHEN-

03:44:30.924 --> 03:44:32.926
LIKE ONE OF THE SPEAKERS HAD

03:44:32.992 --> 03:44:35.562
HAD POINTED OUT. THEY

03:44:35.628 --> 03:44:37.163
TRANSFERRED HIS DAD UP TO

03:44:37.230 --> 03:44:41.835
TWELVE NORTH. AND IS THAT GOING

03:44:41.901 --> 03:44:42.902
TO BE A DETERMINING FACTOR IN

03:44:42.969 --> 03:44:44.270
WHETHER THEY CONTRAST FROM UP

03:44:44.337 --> 03:44:46.339
NORTH THEY FILE A SUIT TO SAY

03:44:46.406 --> 03:44:47.340
HEY WE CAN'T VISIT ANYMORE

03:44:47.407 --> 03:44:49.042
BECAUSE IT'S TOO FAR WELL THE

03:44:49.108 --> 03:44:50.076
NUMBER NOTHING IN THE BILL SAYS

03:44:50.143 --> 03:44:51.811
I NAY AND LET'S LET'S OF GERMAN

03:44:51.878 --> 03:44:52.512
TWO SIDES OF THAT SAME POINT

03:44:52.579 --> 03:44:53.713
YOU'VE JUST SAID NUMBER ONE IS

03:44:53.780 --> 03:44:55.515
THE ABILITY TO VISIT- THE

03:44:55.582 --> 03:44:57.984
ABILITY TO VISIT IS NOT IS NOT-

03:44:58.051 --> 03:44:59.219
ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL THE

03:44:59.285 --> 03:45:00.653
ABILITY TO HAVE VISITATION

03:45:00.720 --> 03:45:02.722
RIGHTS IT. SO I DON'T SEE A

03:45:02.789 --> 03:45:04.290
LINK BETWEEN THIS IN THE

03:45:04.357 --> 03:45:07.260
ABILITY- TO HAVE ANY LEGAL

03:45:07.327 --> 03:45:09.295
ACTION BECAUSE WHETHER THE

03:45:09.362 --> 03:45:11.931
WHETHER THE PERSON CAR SERRATED

03:45:11.998 --> 03:45:13.433
IS- HOW TO SPEAK CITIES FOR THE

03:45:13.499 --> 03:45:14.167
HECK OF IT RIGHT WHETHER

03:45:14.234 --> 03:45:15.468
THEY'RE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:45:15.535 --> 03:45:16.336
WHETHER THEY'RE CENTRAL

03:45:16.402 --> 03:45:18.638
CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA-

03:45:18.705 --> 03:45:19.606
BY THE WAY I LOOK AT THE

03:45:19.672 --> 03:45:21.541
QUESTION THAT WAS POSED IF THEY

03:45:21.608 --> 03:45:24.410
HAVE THE IF THEY HAVE THE- THE

03:45:24.477 --> 03:45:26.512
OF THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE-

03:45:26.579 --> 03:45:29.315
VISITATIONS- THEN YOUR QUESTION

03:45:29.382 --> 03:45:30.083
OR THE QUESTION THAT I HEARD

03:45:30.149 --> 03:45:36.556
ANYWAYS- IS MOOT IT'S. IT'S ON

03:45:36.623 --> 03:45:37.123
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN.

03:45:37.190 --> 03:45:38.558
RIGHT SO. ANYTHING BEYOND THAT

03:45:38.625 --> 03:45:39.993
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM

03:45:40.059 --> 03:45:41.995
ONE OF THE ISSUES ALSO IS THE

03:45:42.061 --> 03:45:44.898
ISSUE OF MANAGEMENT OF A PRISON

03:45:44.964 --> 03:45:46.566
AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PEOPLE

03:45:46.633 --> 03:45:49.168
THAT ARE IN THE PRESENT AND-

03:45:49.235 --> 03:45:51.371
WHEN. YOU MAKE THESE

03:45:51.437 --> 03:45:52.872
LIMITATIONS ARE THE BILL MAKES

03:45:52.939 --> 03:45:55.575
THESE LIMITATIONS ON USING IT

03:45:55.642 --> 03:45:58.912
AS- A DETERRENT FROM. ACTING

03:45:58.978 --> 03:46:00.980
OUT SAY SOMEBODY'S STABS

03:46:01.047 --> 03:46:04.717
ROOMMATE- CELLMATE. I'D

03:46:04.784 --> 03:46:06.986
PROBABLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO

03:46:07.053 --> 03:46:08.888
DETERMINE THAT KIND OF ACTION

03:46:08.955 --> 03:46:10.657
BY SAYING TO SOMEBODY OR AT

03:46:10.723 --> 03:46:11.824
LEAST HAVING TO HOLD OVER THEIR

03:46:11.891 --> 03:46:13.760
HEAD THAT HEY YOU KNOW WHAT IF

03:46:13.826 --> 03:46:14.861
YOU DO STUFF LIKE THAT YOU'RE

03:46:14.928 --> 03:46:16.930
NOT GONNA HAVE VISITATIONS THIS

03:46:16.996 --> 03:46:18.698
WEEK OR THIS MONTH. BECAUSE OF

03:46:18.765 --> 03:46:20.466
THE VALUE THAT VISITATION THAT

03:46:20.533 --> 03:46:22.936
MONTH THEY WON'T DO THAT. SO

03:46:23.002 --> 03:46:24.804
TAKING AWAY THAT INCENTIVE.

03:46:24.871 --> 03:46:27.640
SEEMS TO ME TO BE A BACKWARDS

03:46:27.707 --> 03:46:29.208
WAY OF TRYING TO YOU'RE NOT

03:46:29.275 --> 03:46:31.110
GOING TO GET PEOPLE TO. HAVE

03:46:31.177 --> 03:46:33.813
THE- SAFER ENVIRONMENT IN A

03:46:33.880 --> 03:46:35.548
PRISON. IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE

03:46:35.615 --> 03:46:38.952
INCENTIVE TO DO THAT THAT MAKES.

03:46:39.018 --> 03:46:40.286
AND THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO

03:46:40.353 --> 03:46:42.956
OFFER THAT MAKES IT SAFE. AND

03:46:43.022 --> 03:46:44.924
SO YEAH IT'S YOU KNOW I KIND OF

03:46:44.991 --> 03:46:48.161
STRUGGLED A LOT WITH THIS- YOU

03:46:48.227 --> 03:46:50.697
KNOW BECAUSE I THINK THEY

03:46:50.763 --> 03:46:51.264
ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

03:46:51.331 --> 03:46:53.399
VISIT. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE

03:46:53.466 --> 03:46:55.234
YOU KNOW RELATIVES THAT ARE IN

03:46:55.301 --> 03:46:57.904
JAIL NAY GO VISIT THEM. AND I

03:46:57.971 --> 03:46:59.339
KNOW NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO IT

03:46:59.405 --> 03:47:01.074
BUT THAT'S A LOT OF TIMES YOU

03:47:01.140 --> 03:47:02.608
KNOW THAT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

03:47:02.675 --> 03:47:03.376
MANAGE THEIR LIVES TO BE ABLE

03:47:03.443 --> 03:47:06.779
TO DO THAT. SURE- SO ANYWAY I

03:47:06.846 --> 03:47:08.348
GUESS I STRUGGLE WITH BEING

03:47:08.414 --> 03:47:09.716
ABLE TO SUPPORT BECAUSE OF HER

03:47:09.782 --> 03:47:11.184
MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPOND TO

03:47:11.250 --> 03:47:13.419

03:47:13.486 --> 03:47:15.688
UNDERSTAND. I CAN I CAN SEE THE

04:43:46.008 --> 04:43:47.677
MEMBERS THEMSELVES TO DEVELOP

04:43:47.744 --> 04:43:58.988
THE PROGRAM AND THEN WE GIVE.

04:43:59.055 --> 04:43:59.589
THEM THE RESOURCES TO DO WHAT

04:43:59.655 --> 04:44:01.357
THEY TO DO- TO BE ABLE TO DO

04:44:01.424 --> 04:44:03.025
THEIR- AND IN OUR CASE IT WAS.

04:44:03.092 --> 04:44:04.093
YOU KNOW TOO MANY GUYS IT WE'RE

04:44:04.160 --> 04:44:06.162
HAVING MAY WASTE. ARE ON FOR

04:44:06.229 --> 04:44:07.063
ONE OF THOSE IS NOT WE DID NOT

04:44:07.130 --> 04:44:09.031
ADDING HEALTH. GAIL THIS THING

04:44:09.098 --> 04:44:11.100
TO THE PHYSICAL WELLNESS

04:44:11.167 --> 04:44:12.802
PROGRAM RIGHT RIGHT AND NOW I

04:44:12.869 --> 04:44:14.704
THINK IN RETROSPECT I THINK

04:44:14.771 --> 04:44:15.705
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD

04:44:15.772 --> 04:44:17.106
HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE

04:44:17.173 --> 04:44:19.409
TO INCLUDE. BUT IT ALL COMES

04:44:19.475 --> 04:44:21.744
DOWN TO PROVIDING THE RESOURCES

04:44:21.811 --> 04:44:23.880
FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

04:44:23.946 --> 04:44:25.648
THE WAY THEY NEED TO DO IT. IF

04:44:25.715 --> 04:44:27.984
WE DON'T HAVE CLIENTS FROM THEM.

04:44:28.050 --> 04:44:31.454
IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT- FOR

04:44:31.521 --> 04:44:34.023
A PROGRAM TO BE SUCCESSFUL

04:44:34.090 --> 04:44:34.590
BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST BE TOO

04:44:34.657 --> 04:44:38.961
MUCH RESISTANCE. AND. AND IT

04:44:39.028 --> 04:44:39.562
MIGHT NOT BE IN THE FORM THAT

04:44:39.629 --> 04:44:42.532
THEY NEED- SO THAT'S WHAT MY

04:44:42.598 --> 04:44:44.667
STRUGGLE IS AT THIS BECAUSE I

04:44:44.734 --> 04:44:47.236
CERTAINLY SUPPORT. TRYING TO

04:44:47.303 --> 04:44:49.439
HELP BECAUSE THAT IS IT'S A

04:44:49.505 --> 04:44:53.676
HORRIBLE SITUATION- IT.

04:44:53.743 --> 04:44:55.311
TERMINATES ALL ACROSS PUBLIC

04:44:55.378 --> 04:44:57.680
SAFETY THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS

04:44:57.747 --> 04:44:59.182
FIRE DEPARTMENTS. ACTIONAL

04:44:59.248 --> 04:45:03.152
FACILITIES AND- SO YOU KNOW IT

04:45:03.219 --> 04:45:07.056

04:45:07.123 --> 04:45:07.690
ABLE TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES

04:45:07.757 --> 04:45:10.359
THEY NEED. AND FORCING THEIR

04:45:10.426 --> 04:45:12.195
RESOURCES I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

04:45:12.261 --> 04:45:13.763
APPROACH IS GOING TO WORK AND

04:45:13.830 --> 04:45:16.466
THAT'S MY CONCERN. SO ANYWAY

04:45:16.532 --> 04:45:18.468

THE FUNDING FOR THEM TO BE ABLE

04:45:33.049 --> 04:45:34.417
TO MAKE A PROGRAM WORKED IT'S A

04:45:34.484 --> 04:45:36.586

BARGAINING BARGAINING IS

04:46:00.843 --> 04:46:03.513
PROBABLY AN IMPORTANT AVENUE TO

BE INCLUDED SOMEWHERE IN THIS.

04:46:05.248 --> 04:46:07.283

EXPERIMENTS- I LOOK AT THIS AS-

04:46:48.958 --> 04:46:50.927
WELL. GIVING THEM MORE MONEY.

04:46:50.993 --> 04:46:52.662

OBVIOUSLY BOTH HAVE TWO MAIN

04:47:34.570 --> 04:47:35.771
REASONS WHY WE DON'T TRUST EACH

04:47:35.838 --> 04:47:37.206
