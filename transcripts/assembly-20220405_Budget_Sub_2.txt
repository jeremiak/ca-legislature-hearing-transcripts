LIKE ALL HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS LAST YEAR'S- BUDGET PROVIDED COMMUNIQU ALL THOSE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING INCREASE ONE LARGEST IN HISTORY- AFTER THE KOBE DEFERRALS IN TWO YEARS AGO WERE ABLE TO PAY THOSE BACK AND PROVIDE A 5% COLA. WE KNOW THAT COLLEGES FACED A COST INCREASES INCLUDING PENSION COSTS AND ENSURING THE FACULTY AND STAFF RECEIVE FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS WILL TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY AS WELL AS A NEW FUNDING FORMULA- IN HOW WE CAN BEST PLAN FOR COLLEGES GOING FORWARD. OF COURSE OUR MAIN CONCERN IN THIS COMMITTEE OVER THE YEARS ALWAYS ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INCLUDING COMMUNICABLE JUST WITHOUT THE BARRIERS FOR- STUDENT. FEES IS MINIMAL- COMMUNICABLE **** WITH THE- THE PROMISED GRANTSAS WELL AS THREE COMMUNIQU ALL FULL TIME STUDENTS- BUT IT'S ALWAYS AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH THE NON TUITION COSTS- ONE ISSUE THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON. IS THE BIG DROP IN ENROLLMENT OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS LAST THREE YEARS TWO YEARS AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- NOT CERTAIN IF THIS IS A TEMPORARY- DROPPERS GOING TO BOUNCE BACK BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME. OVER OUR OVERALL DONE CONCERNS FOR CALIFORNIA AND OUR ECONOMY IN THESE COLLEGES THAT WE KNOW IT'S A NATIONAL ISSUE AS WELL- WE'D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT STRATEGIES FOR GETTING STUDENTS BACK- FOCUSING ON. IN PERSON- TO HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT- AND LASTLY WE LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSION ABOUT CALIBRATE CALIBRATE COLLEGE- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER. OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS I BELIEVE ALL OF THEM TO HAVE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS. ONLINE COLLEGE- HOW IT OPERATES AND WHAT WE DO GOING FORWARD SO WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN WE'LL START ISSUE NUMBER ONE. THE ROMANS AND BRING UP THE PERMANENT FINANCE LA- IN OUR CANCERS OFFICE. EVERYBODY IS IN PERSON. FINALLY JOINT. WITH. OKAY BERMAN TO FINANCE GOOD MORNING THIS EARNERS TIME WE SEE EVERYBODY IN PERSON I KNOW AND I THINK OVER TWO YEARS SO WELCOME BACK THANK YOU IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK- WELL GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS- DAN HAD ARE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE START OF LIKE TO QUICKLY TOUCH ON THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES MULTIROTOR AT. THE RUNOFF BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOCUSES ON EQUITY AND STUDENT SUCCESS- BUILDING UPON THE SYSTEM'S VISION FOR SUCCESS THE ROADMAP ESTABLISHES SHARED EXPECTATIONS IN A VICIOUS GOALS. INVESTING AVAILABLE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES. FOR THE COLLEGES TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS IN EXPANDING CHANCES OFFICE CAPACITY. TO BETTER SUPPORT COLLEGES IN MEETING THESE GOALS. IN PARTICULAR THE MULTI YEAR ROADMAP FOCUSES ON GOALS RELATED TO INTEREST SEGMENTAL COLLABORATION FOR TIMELY TRANSFER. REDUCING TIME TO DEGREE. CLOSING EQUITY GAPS AND IMPROVING ALIGNMENT WITH K. TWELVE AND WORKFORCE NEEDS. ARE NOW TURN TO ENROLLMENT. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SEE DECLINING ENROLLMENT ACROSS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AS A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO BASE FUNDING FOR DISTRICTS. TO EIGHT ADDRESSING THIS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND IS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR ENROLLMENT OUTREACH TO- AND STUDENT RETENTION EFFORTS. BUILDING ON THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION PROVIDED LAST YEAR. THESE FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR SIMILAR USES AS THE AFTER MENTIONED FUNDS PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET LEARNING MENTALITY DEMAND TO THE STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE BUDGET INCLUDES AN EXPECTATION THAT DISTRICTS PROVIDE AT LEAST 50% IN PERSON EDUCATION. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE ACADEMIC YEAR PROVIDED THAT APPROACH IS CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES IN PLACE AT THE TIME. AND STUDENT DEMAND. THIS EXPECTATION IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND ENCOURAGE GREATER ENROLLMENT. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT HIS INVESTMENTS. THANK YOU L. L. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN CARTY POSTING HAUSEN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. TO TALK ABOUT. THE TWO PROPOSALS IN YOUR- AGENDA PAGE FIVE. ON THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH PROPOSAL THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ROMAN GROWTH. AND THEN THE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME. THAT MISTER HANOVER MENTION FOR RECRUITMENT RETENTION STRATEGIES TRENDS FOR TWO YEAR COLLEGES CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT ENROLLMENT DECLINE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. AND THE AGENDA REALLY DOES A GOOD JOB SUMMARIZING THOSE TRENDS. ARE BASED ON PRELIMINARY DATA FOR THE CURRENT YEAR SOME DISTRICTS APPEAR TO BE RECOVERING FROM LOST IN ROMAN. BUT FEW IF ANY ARE ANYWHERE BACK TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. SO DESPITE OF WHAT'S WEAKENED ROMAN DEMAND RIGHT NOW BUT LEGISLATURE STILL MIGHT WANT TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF GROWTH FUNDING. IN THE BUDGET YEAR GIVEN THAT ENROLLMENT POTENTIALLY COULD START TO REBOUND NEXT YEAR NOW EVEN IF THE ENTIRE AMOUNT DESN'T END UP GETTING USED EARNED BY DISTRICTS THAT MONEY CAN STILL BE USED TO FUND SHORTFALLS FUNDING SHORTFALLS IN THE FORMULA. OR OTHER PURPOSES AND SO IT'S REALLY A LOW RISK OF LEGISLATURE PROVIDING SOME LEVEL OF ROLLING GROWTH FUNDING FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND THAT WAY THAT MONEY CAN JUST BE USED IF IT'S NOT EARNED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. WITH REGARD TO THE HUNDRED TWENTY HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. ONE TIME THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGIES- AS MISTER HANOVER JUST NOTED THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. NOW WHEN THAT MONEY WAS ALLOCATED TO WAS APPROPRIATED TO THE COLLEGES THEY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT ON HOW MUCH THEY SPENT HOW MUCH THEY HAVE LEFT OR EVEN WHAT THE EFFECTIVENESS WERE OF THOSE FUNDS AND SO THE LEGISLATURE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A GOOD IDEA AT THIS POINT. ABOUT- WHETHER ANOTHER ROUND OF FUNDING REALLY IS HAS MERIT TOWARDS A PROMISING USE OF MONEY. IN ADDITION THERE ARE NUMBER OF SURVEYS THAT- THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND OTHERS HAVE DONE- AND RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE MAIN REASONS WHY CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT ENROLLING IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNICORP WHICH IS IT AT THIS TIME IS THE NEED TO WORK FULL TIME- GIVEN THIS FAVORABLE JOB MARKET. AND THE NEED TO CARE FOR FAMILY SO IF THAT'S THE CASE IT'S UNCLEAR IF MONEY FOR RECRUITMENT RETENTION STRATEGIES MONEY FOR MORE PHONE BANKS AND ADVERTISING IS GOING TO HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT. BUT TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE THINKS THE COULD BE A GOOD USE OF MONEY OR HAVE AN IMPACT THE LEGISLATURE COULD COULD APPROPRIATE THAT MONEY ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BETO MAKE THIS MONEY MORE FLEXIBLE TO TAKE THIS HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME OR ANY AMOUNT THAT THE LEGISLATURE. YOU KNOW WANTS TO DECIDE ON. AND USE IT AND ALLOW COLLEGES TO USE IT FOR BROADER PURPOSES SO ALLOW THEM TO USE IT FOR RECRUITMENT RESEARCH STRATEGIES BUT ALSO THEY CAN MAYBE USE IT FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE COVERED RELATED PURPOSES OF GIVING THEM. A COLLEGE IS MORE OF AN OPTION TO USE THAT MONEY KIND F LIKE A BLOCK GRANT SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. GOOD MORNING TURN MCCARTY- AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE LIZ THAT NEVER HAD EXECUTIVE VICE IN SERVICE TO TIONAL SUPPORTS AND SUCCESS OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WE ARE PROUD THAT TODAY'S- COLLEGE POPULATION LOOKS AND REPRESENTS. A LIGHT CALIFORNIA IN FACT 64% OF ME COLLEGE STUDENTS OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND 40% OF THEM ARE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND OLDER. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS- THE CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGE IS A PLACE GREATER FOCUS ON OUTREACH TO POSTER NATIONAL STUDENTS THOSE THAT DON'T FIT. THE NORM BUT THAT HAS- IS OUT BEEN OUTDATED IN CALLING ON THE STUDENTS NONTRADITIONAL- IN FACT THEY ARE OUR OUR STUDENTS. THIS FALL THE CHANGES OFFICE VISITED EIGHT COLLEGES BECAUSE WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH OUR STUDENTS AND WHAT WE HEARD- IS THAT THEY RE ITERATED POINT THAT THE ALLEY- MENTIONED THAT. A STUDENTS ARE FINDING IT BEAT BALANCE SCHOOL AND WORK OVER 60% OF OUR STUDENTS WORK MORE THEN- PART TIME. NEARLY THIRTY HOURS OR MORE A WEEK MAKING THEM THE SOLE PROVIDERS NOT JUST FOR ENRICHMENT BUT REALLY FOR. A SOUL- BEING THE SOLE PROVIDERS AND FOR NECESSITY. THEY REITERATED THAT MANY OF THEM HAVE DEPENDENT CHILDREN OR ARE K. CARETAKERS OF PARENTS AND OLDER. MANY OF THEM ARE FIRST GENERATION. THESE POPULATIONS ACROSS A RANGE OF INDICATORS HAVE EXPERIENCED GREATER HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS- AND AS THE GREAT RENEGOTIATION HAS OCCURRED. MANY OF THEM ARE FINDING OPPORTUNITIES AND OPPORTUNITY COSTS AND RETURNING TO WORK. SO OUR WORK IS REALLY TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE SEEING THE VALUE THE LONG TERM VALUE. IN HIGHER EDUCATION. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THESE ARE NOT ICE TO- AND THAT ACROSS THE NATION OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE BEEN HIT ESPECIALLY HARD BECAUSE MANY OF THEM FALL INTO THESE INDICATORS. WE KNOW THAT THE POP DAY PANDEMIC CAME AS A PRE PANDEMIC IT ENROLLMENT DECLINES WERE ALREADY ANTICIPATED CALIFORNIA AS YOU MAY KNOW FROM YOUR WORK IN K. TWELVE IS LOST- THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. AND K. TWELVE ENROLLMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO DROP PRECIPITOUSLY BY TWENTY THIRTY ALL OF THESE AFFECT OUR LONG TERM PROJECTIONS. AND CREATE URGENCY AROUND OUR NEED TO REACHED OLDER ADULT LEARNERS. WE'RE FORTUNATE THAT ACROSS TO ME COLLEGES ARE LEADERS HAVE REALLY GALVANIZED TO ORGANIZE AROUND ON BRINGING STUDENTS BACK. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WE ALSO ARE WORKING WITH VARIOUS FOCUS GROUPS STUDENTS SURVEYS AND WHILE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THAT COLLEGES HAVE DONE IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN. OPERATING CALL CENTRES TO REACH OUT TO STUDENTS THAT MAYBE TOOK AN EXCUSE WITHDRAWAL DURING THE PANDEMIC SO THAT THEY CAN COME BACK. OR STUDENTS THAT ENROLLED IN ONE SEMESTER AND THEN HAVE IT COME BACK- TRYING TO RE ENGAGING. WHERE ARE COLLEGES ARE REIMAGINING HOW THEY PACKAGE STUDENTS SUPPORTS SO THEY'RE NOT JUST FOR PROVIDING FINANCIAL LATER ALSO PROVIDING EMERGENCY GRANTS. PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT LAPTOPS ARE HOT SPOTS ACCESS TO FOOD PANTRIES FORGIVING DEBT ACROSS OF OUR OUR DISTRICTS OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF STUDENT DEBT HAS BEEN FORGIVEN- AND THEN OUR- COLLEGES ARE ALSO PROVIDING EMERGENCY GRANTS AND VOUCHERS. THEY'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON DUAL ENROLLMENT- AND CREATING GREATER PARTNERSHIPS WHEN THEIR K. TWELVE AND OTHER INDUSTRY PARTNERS. AND THEY'RE EXPLORING- CHANGES COURSE SEQUENCING AND SHORTER QUALITY. COURSES THAT CAN GET STUDENTS IN AND. OUT AND BACK INTO THE LABOR MARKET. SO AS SUCH WE SEE. DEEPER ENROLLMENT GREW. AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME FOR STUDENT RETENTION FOR PROFITS ARE OUT SPENDING ASKS FLORIDA ONE WHEN IT COMES TO REACHING OUT TO STUDENTS WE NEED TO RE ITERATE THE VALUE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THESE RESOURCES ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE A RESENCE FOR CALIFORNIA COMING COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY THE FEDERAL STIMULUS DOLLARS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BE USED ON OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT STRATEGIES SO THIS IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THAT PURPOSE. OUR WORK IS COMPLEX AND CRITICAL BUT WE ARE READY TO BE STEADFAST PARTNERS WITH YOU TO SERVE CALIFORNIANS THAT NEED US MOST THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY HOWEVER A FEW QUESTIONS- MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR THE FOR THE L. A. O. ON ON IN THE ENROLLMENT DROP I HAVE THE SAME QUESTION FOR OUR- K. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS I KNOW A LOT OF THEM ARE. FREAKING OUT BY DECLINING ENROLLMENTS IN HOUSE IMPACTS OUR FINANCES BUT I BECAUSE AS A LABOR PERSON I ASK WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL BECAUSE YOU HAVE A- EXACT NUMBER GOING FOR EDUCATION. IF THERE'S FEAR STUDENTS TO SPIKE YOU KNOW MATHEMATICS YOU LEARN IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YOU GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY SO YOU GET MORE MONEY FOR FEWER STUDENTS. SO IT'S THE SAME THING WITH OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES GET 11% OF PROP NINETY EIGHT. GRANTED WE HAVE OTHER PROBLEMS WITH NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE IN COLLEGE UP IN THAT TRANSFER STUDENTS FOR UC'S HIS. WHEN HE WORKED GETTING DEGREES INSERT. TO FILL THE JOB OF TODAY AND TOMORROW AND ET ALL THAT BUT AS FAR AS THE MONEY PIECE. THE DISTRICTS. IF THEY'RE STILL BE STILL GET 11% OF PROPERTY WHICH IS GROWING GROWING GROWING. R. ISN'T IT THEY'RE GETTING MORE MONEY FOR IF YOUR STUDENTS SO WHY WOULD ANYBODY WHAT'S THE CONCERN. SURE I THINK THAT'S RIGHT YOU HAVE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE IT'S ABOUT 38% RIGHT NOW OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES GO FOR K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION. AND THEN SIDES OF THE CONSTITUTION AND STATUTE YOU HAVE A SPLIT THAT GOES BETWEEN OF THAT MONEY. K. TWELVE GETS A CERTAIN PERCENT AND COMMITTEE COLLEGES GET A CERTAIN PERCENT I THINK IT'S ABOUT 11% THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE GET AND SNATCHING. SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DOES THAT MONEY GO OUT THEN TO THE COLLEGES AND SO COLLEGES- WILL TELL YOU AT LEAST ADMINISTRATORS OF THEIR THE PAPER PAPER FOR THAT MONEY AND UNRESTRICTED WAY THROUGH PORTION IT'S WHICH IS THEIR STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. AND SO IF THE FORMULA IS BASED IN LARGE PART ON ENROLLMENT ENROLLMENT DECLINES AND THEY'RE GOING TO SEE A DECLINE IN THE UNRESTRICTED. OF APPORTIONMENT MONEY THAT THEY GET. THAT MONEY THEN. WOULD NEED TO GO BACK INTO EITHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR IF YOU MENDED STATUTE K. TWELVE AND NOW MONEY PRESUMABLY THEN WOULD GO INTO RESTRICTED- FOR RESTRICTED PURPOSES SO. WHICH WHICH GIVES THEM LESS CONTROL SO IT'S KIND OF AN ISSUE FOR THE COLLEGES ABOUT HOW THAT MONEY COMES TO THEM DOES IT COME TO THE MINUTE UNRESTRICTED WAY WHERE THEY HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY OVER HOW THEY USE THAT MONEY TOWARDS A COME IN AND IN A IN A RESTRICTED WAY WHERE THEY'RE TOLD EXACTLY HOW THE MONEY COULD BE USED IN THERE ARE WORRIED ABOUT A MISALIGNMENT I GET ALL THAT BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IF. THE COMMUNICABLE JUST HAVING FEWER STUDENTS AND ROLL SWEET HERE CONCERNED- NO WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT OUR BUDGET BECAUSE WE HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT BUT YOU'RE STILL GETTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM THE STATE FOR EDUCATING COMMITTEE CALL STUDENTS YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY GETTING MORE MONEY PER STUDENT YOU STILL GET THE SAME OUT OF POCKETS HIGHER YOUR- FACULTY PAY SALARIES PAY YOUR YOU KNOW PLAN FEES AND MAINTENANCE AND- ENERGY COSTS SO. WHY WHY THE BIG DEAL FROM YOU KNOW DISTRICTS WHO ARE. YOU KNOW FREAKING OUT I GUESS. IF IT'S NOT EQUAL IF. IF LET'S SAY THERE'S HUNDRED COMMITTEE CALL DISTRICTS AND IT'S A HUNDRED AND TEN OR SOMETHING THAT LET'S SAY LIKE A HUNDRED OF THEM HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT THERE DIRT DECREASING BY 5% EVERY YEAR AND THEN. THE OTHER TENER DECREASING BY 20% SO THEY'RE OUT LIARS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BUT IF EVERYTHING'S BASICALLY SOMEWHAT IN THE RANGE OF EVERYBODY'S FALLING. IN A SIMILAR MANNER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT AND WHY WHY THE CONCERN. SO YOU'RE RIGHT THE MONEY PER STUDENT WOULD STAY THE SAME IN THAT CASE OVERALL IS SIMIEN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT STATUS LEVEL COMMUNITY COLLEGES GOT THEIR 11% BUT IF THE FORMULA WHERE TO STAY THE SAME THE APPORTIONMENT. FORMULA WHERE TO STAY THE SAME AS IT IS NOW. FUNDING PER STUDENT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THEY GET PER STUDENT HOW MUCH THEY GET PER IN ROMAN R. FOR OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE TO STAY THE SAME THAT LEVEL WOULD DROP SO THEY'RE THEY'RE UNRESTRICTED MONEY THEIR PORTION OF MONEY WOULD DROP. AND THEY WOULD THEN GET MONEY. TO THEM ON A RESTRICTED BASIS AND THAT WOULD BE. AS THEY WOULD SEE A LIMITING SO YOU'RE RIGHT OVERALL THE FUNDING PER STUDENT WOULD SAY THE SAME. BUT COLLEGES ARE ALSO THINKING ABOUT WILL HOW MUCH. ABILITY HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DO I HAVE OVER THAT MONEY BECAUSE IF IT COMES BACK JUST IN THE FORM OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I'M SURE THEY WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY BUT WE STILL HAVE SALARIES TO PAY WE STILL HAVE PENSION OBLIGATIONS TO MEET WE STILL HAVE OTHER OPERATING COSTS. GOTCHA AND THEN FOR MAYBE YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN US ON THIS- FORMER CHANCELLORS OFFICE THAT- FORGET YOUR LAST NAME. AT THE AT EXACTLY- WHAT'S ON WHAT IT FROM DO YOU HAVE AS FAR AS THAT GOES ON INTENT RIGHT SO THE THEIR INVOLVEMENT DECLINES OUR- I'M SURE THAT'S DIFFERENT BUT IS THERE ARE AS OUR A RAFFLE RANGER IS IT ROUGHLY IN THE SAME- PERCENTAGE WHAT CAN YOU LINE IS HERE. WITH YEAH I HAVE SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT KIND OF WHERE WE ARE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT- THERE HAVE BEEN ENROLLMENT DECLINES ACROSS ALL SEVENTY THREE DISTRICTS AND A HUNDRED SIXTEEN COLLEGES- THERE. AND MORE ON EVEN IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE- WE'VE SEEN DROPS IN THE FAR NORTH. AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN DROPS AND SOME OF IT- THE MORE EXPENSIVE AREAS TO LIVE I THINK PART OF- THOSE KIND OF ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE FACING. WE DO SHOW SOME DISTRICTS ABOUT FIVE THAT ARE STARTING TO- RE ENROLL STUDENTS WHO WERE SEEING THEIR STRATEGIES PAYING OFF AS SOME OF THEIR INVESTMENT OF THEIR FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS. IN COMBINATION WITH THE STATE INVESTMENTS WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC WE LOST A LOT OF MALE STUDENTS PARTICULARLY BLACK AND- AND NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS SO THEY'RE A LOT IT TARGETED EFFORTS NOW. TO BRING BACK THOSE STUDENTS- ANOTHER KEY STRATEGY THAT'S REALLY BEEN EFFECTIVE HAS BEEN DISMISSING FEES SOMETHING THAT COLLEGES HAVE DONE THROUGH THE FEDERAL. DOLLARS THAT THEY RECEIVED. I GUESS WHAT I ASKED IF WE HAVE A TO DO YOU HAVE LIKE A RANGE AS FAR AS AB YOU KNOW RAPPERS ARE IS YET ONE THAT'S AT 25% ONE THAT THREE OR ITS IT'S- ARE THEY- DO WE HAVE LIKE 90% ARE ROUGHLY. BETWEEN ONE NUMBER OTHER NUMBER YEAH I CAN ALSO GET IT WE HAVE A MEMO THAT SHOWS THAT NOT- I'LL BE. SURE TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU SHORTLY AFTER THIS BUT THE RANGE RIGHT NOW THAT WE'RE SEEING. IS ANYWHERE FROM AN EIGHT TO A 28% GOTCHA. AND HOW MANY ARE IN THAT HIGHER AND TO ROUGHLY. MOST ELEVEN THE MEDIAN- RANGE AROUND TWELVE TO FIFTEEN- ACROSS OUR COLLEGES WHERE YOU ARE SEEING THOSE LARGER ONES AGAIN I MENTIONED. MANY OF THEM WERE IN AREAS THAT WERE ALREADY SEEING LARGE POPULATION DECLINES EVEN PRE PANDEMIC. AND THIS JUST EXACERBATED THAT WERE PEOPLE MOVING OUT FOR COST OF LIVING OR OTHER. ISSUES SUCH AND THEN I KNOW THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR- CHAIR TEAM. ON THE- IN PERSON. R. HE I MIGHT. THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES ARE WHICH ARE THE LAST SEGMENT TO GO. FULLY IN PERSON- BUT IS THAT A FACTOR IS HAVING MORE. ONLINE ESSENTIALLY- PROVIDING. A REASON FOR PEOPLE TO ENROLL MORE HAS MORE THAN AROUND YOU KNOW 40% OF OUR STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE OUR OVER TWENTY FIVE WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND IS THAT WHEN A COLLEGE OR DISTRICT PUTS THEIR COURSE SCHEDULE ON UP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER MANY OF THEM SEE THEIR ONLINE CLASSES FILL UP FIRST AND THEN- ARE HAVING TO CONVERT IN PERSON CLASSES ONLINE OR A HYBRID MODALITY SO. RIGHT NOW- AROUND IN PERSON OR AT LEAST STARTING AS IN PERSON AND THEN TRANSITIONING ONCE THEY SEE STUDENT DEMAND WE SEE THAT ALSO REFLECTED IN ERY SURVEYS THAT WE'VE HAD OF STUDENTS WHERE THEY'VE LEARNED THAT THEY LIKE THE FLEXIBILITY IT WORKS FOR CERTAIN CLASSES. ARE CAREER AND CLASSES HAVE BEEN PREDOMINATELY- IN PERSON SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC FOLLOWING HEALTH AND SAFETY- PROTOCOLS SO WE ARE SEEING A DIFFERENCE BUT FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE WORKING THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO BATTLE TRAFFIC FINE CARE TAKERS. AND WHILE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO GO TO SCHOOL. OKAY THANK YOU. QUESTIONS MR HEY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I WANNA GO BACK TO THE TO THE DISCUSSION OF ONLINE COURSES AND LOOKING AT THE CHART HERE ON PAGE FIVE. AND IT. IT SHOWS ME **** IF I'M READING THIS CORRECTLY. BUT SHOWS THAT IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE'RE TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ONLINE. AND NOW WE HAVE PROBABLY- LOOKS LIKE UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND ONLINE IS THAT ACCURATE. YEAH AND THIS IS ACTUALLY BASED ON OUR THIS IS A BASED ON A SURVEY OF SIXTY EIGHT DISTRICTS SO DOESN'T INCLUDE- ALL REPORTING BUT WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THAT THERE IS YOU SEE THAT- THAT COMPLETE SHIFT- AND SO YOU ALSO I KNOW- THAT THESE ARE FROM FALL- TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN SPRING- HIM WE'LL SEE MORE IN PERSON COME THIS SPRING- BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER OUR DEMAND IS STILL. CONTINUING TO BE HIGHER FOR ONLINE OR HYBRID CLASSES WILL NOTE THAT FACULTY ARE ALSO EXPLORING A NEW MODALITY THAT- MANY OF THEM FIND A VERY EFFECTIVE CALLED HIGH FLEX WHEN THEY CAN BOTH IN PERSON- AND ONLINE IN A VERY INTERACTIVE. MODE SO- IF I'M CORRECT THE DATA SHOWS THAT STUDENTS TYPICALLY AREN'T AS SUCCESSFUL IN THE ONLINE EXPERIENCES THEY ARE AND THEN CLASS- AS THEY ARE IN THE WITH THE IN CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE SO WHY SHOULD WE DO SOMETHING. AND THIS MAY BE A QUESTION FOR THE CHAIR LATER I DON'T KNOW WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO ENSURE THERE ARE MORE IN PERSON CLASSES BECAUSE FOR SOME IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE I GET THAT- STATES THEIR LIFE RIGHT THEY'VE GOT JOBS ETCETERA BUT FOR SOME THAT MAY NOT BE SO TRUE IF THEY'RE NOT IF STUDENTS AREN'T FINDING SUCCESS. IN THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE OF THE UNITY CAREFUL ABOUT PROMOTING IT. HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION SO IS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OPEN. WE ARE- WE GO BACK TO OUR REAP WHAT WE'RE CALLING OUR TRANSITION BACK ON HYBRID SPACE- NEXT MONTH SO YOU GO BACK TO THE SO THE OFFICE IS NOT OPEN TODAY. WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING- EVERY SINCE THEN BUT WE GOT THIS IS A TO ME. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN ASK TEACHERS AND STUDENTS TO GO BACK IN A CLASSROOM BUT NOT HALF ASKED PEOPLE TO GO INTO AN OFFICE BUILDING GO TO WORK IN THIS NOT YOU NOT PUTTING THIS ON YOU PERSONALLY. BUT IS JUST CRAZY TO ME TO THINK THAT THE CHANCES OFFICES OPEN FULLY OPEN DAY AND RENEW MY CREDENTIAL RIGHT I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT THE PLATFORM THE COMPUTER PLATFORM. I CALLED OVER. WELL I TRIED TO CALL OVER TEACHER CREDENTIALING COMMISSION. WELL THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER TO CALL BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS AT HOME. THERE WAS AN EMAIL ADDRESSES I DON'T WANT EMAIL ANYBODY. BUT THE POINT IS- PEOPLE NEED TO GET BACK IN THE OFFICE. SO THAT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM CAN FUNCTION OUTSIDE OF THE K. TWELVE SCHOOL. K. FOURTEEN IF YOU WILL. AS WELL TO ME IT'S JUST. I CAN'T CONCEIVE. WHY YOU KNOW THE THESE. THE STATE OFFICES ARE NOT OPEN I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET MISTER CHAIR. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE OPEN. BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE CAN AS TEACHERS GO BACK IN A CLASSROOM STUDENTS GOING TO CLASS ME YET CAN'T SEEM TO. TO DO IT THEMSELVES AND- IT WE NEED TO LOOK AT TYING FACILITIES MONEY TO IT BECAUSE OF YOU ARE. TOO IF STUDENTS ARE COMING BACK TO THE CLASSROOM. DO WE NEED TO. GIVE AS MUCH FACILITIES MONEY TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. I GET THERE'S NAY THEIR- RIGHT TO GET THERE'S MAINTENANCE I GET THIS REHABILITATION BUT OF STUDENTS ARE COMING BACK TO THE CAMPUS. MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO REBOOT AS WELL TAKING A LOOK AT THAT- WITH THAT I'M I THINK YOU. GOT A QUESTION. YOU'RE THE ONE RESPONSIBLE IT'S NOT REALLY QUITE EIGHT. PROBABLY A- AND- DON TAURIEL MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. BUT I REALIZED BUT I WHAT I AM JUST THE STRUCTURE WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION I'M ADAM. SAYS NEED TO GET OPEN THE CONSERVE THE INSTITUTIONS. THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO SERVE THANK YOU. YEAH THAT'S IT THAT'S AN ISSUE I GUESS THERE'S TWO ISSUES THERE ONE WE'RE SEEING DECLINING ENROLLMENT. AND ONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE ON IN PERSON BUT I GUESS THE COLLEGES ARE SAYING WELL IF WE DO ALL IN PERSON WE MAY NOT BRING BACK IN A MOMENT BECAUSE SOME OF THE STUDENTS ARE USED TO NOW DOING THE ONLINE- THAT WE DON'T KNOW LONG TERM IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL YOU KNOW THEY'RE PARTICIPATING BUT ARE THEY- DOING WELL AND THEY YOU KNOW- MOVING ALONG IN AND GETTING. OUT OF IT WHAT THEY NEED- I KNOW OF- COLLEGES FOR YEARS IT HAD SOME TYPE OF HYBRID TYPE PROGRAM SO. I WILL ADD THAT IN EARLY DATA WE'VE SEEN THAT STUDENTS- HAVE ACTUALLY DONE WELL- ANNA AND PART OF THAT IS YOU KNOW THAT THE GREAT WORK OF OUR FACULTY AND THEY'VE REALLY ENGAGED IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THIS WORK HAS PROGRESSED SO WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT. ONLINE TEACHING ONLINE QUALITY AND SO WE JUST WHERE- SERVING MYRIADOF STUDENTS AND ALL HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR NEEDS A LOT MORE DURING THIS TIME. YEAH OKAY. THANK YOU WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN WE'RE GONNA SKIP AROUND THE AGENDA AND- I KNOW. THERE ARE SOME MEMBERS WHO HAVE TO BE ANOTHER COMMITTEES TODAY'S BUSY DAY- SO WE'RE GONNA JUMP TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT RIGHT NOW CALTRAIN. FOR YEAH RIGHT WE'RE JUST HEARING FROM- CALIBRATE TO PERMIT A FINANCE ELIA. THIS IS. YOUR LIFE THIS IS THE CASE YEAH THE I WOULD JUST HEARING FROM THE **** WHERE IS THE TELE YEAH WHETHER TWENTY FOUR LAST WEEK. VERY LITTLE WE HAVE LA. NO OKAY YEAH THIS IS JUST NOT SORRY NOT THE L. A. NORTH IS JUST ENOUGH. TO HEAR FROM CALIBRATE AND R. LEE- DIRECT ON. WITH MINUTE THE YES HAS THE PRESIDENT YES IT PRESIDENT MANY THANK YOU YES WELCOME WELCOME THANK YOU- SHOULD BEGIN YES PLEASE HEY GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN CARTY I SHARE FONG AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THIS MORNING WE AT CAL RIGHT CONTINUE TO BE LASER FOCUSED ON BUILDING A NEW COLLEGE FROM THE GROUND UP AND I'M VERY PROUD TO SHARE OUR RECENT PROGRESS SINCE JULY WE MORE THAN DOUBLED OUR ENROLLMENT WE CREATED NEW SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR STUDENTS. WATCHIN INNOVATIVE NEW PROGRAM WELCOME CSEA AS ARE CLASSIFIED UNION AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE. WE'VE ALSO TAKEN TO HEART AND ACCEPTED EACH OF THE IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE STATE AUDITOR LAST SPRING. AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO ACCOMPLISH EACH DELIVERABLE ON A PRESCRIBED TIME FOR TIMELINE. ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH A STARTED PERIOD AND OPEN FOR ENROLLMENT SINCE OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE MET EVERY MILESTONE OUTLINED IN CALVERT COUNTY LEGISLATION. AND- TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE FOR CREDIT ATION. AND WE ARE GUIDED BY OUR BOARD APPROVED STRATEGIC VISION WHICH LAYS OUT AN AGGRESSIVE BUT ACHIEVABLE SET OF GOALS. AND A CLEAR PATH FORWARD TO THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND BEYOND. AS A STATEWIDE INSTITUTION WE ARE GUIDED BY THE REALITIES OUR STUDENTS FACE IN KEY REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND SO I'M PLEASED TO SHARE THAT WE CONTINUE TO TAKE SUBSTANTIAL STEPS FORWARD DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS WITH MISSION ALIGNED ORGANIZATIONS. RESEARCH FROM OUR COLLEAGUES AT CAL COMPETES TELLS US THAT 42% OF ADULTS. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WOULD LIKE TO ENROLL IN HIGHER ED BUT ONLY 7% ACTUALLY ARE. AND WHEN WE SPEAK WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES LIKE THE INLAND AND EMPIRE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP. WE HEAR OF THE NEED FOR AN EDUCATIONAL PARTNER THAT IS NIMBLE AND RESPONSIVE TO BOTH REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE NEED. THERE'S A SHARED PRIORITY ACROSS INDUSTRY AND EDUCATION TO EMPOWER ADULT LEARNERS. THIS IS WHY WE ARE WORKING WITH. TIONAL SERVICES IT'S WHY WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH S. C. A. U. U. H. W. UNITED HEALTH CARE WORKERS. TO DEVELOP A LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSING TRAINING PROGRAM TO CREATE AN ACCESSIBLE AND POWERFUL PIPELINE FOR MORE TOWARD MORE DIVERSE FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING WITH NEXT GEN POLICY TO EXPLORE I. T. TRAINING FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN HELP BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL ORGANIZATIONS. AND REFLECTING OUR ROLE ON THE LEADING EDGE OF THE LEARNING CURVE WE'VE LAUNCHED A MULTI YEAR PARTNERSHIP WITH UC IRVINE'S TOP RANKED SCHOOL OF EDUCATION. THROUGH THIS COLLABORATION WILL APPLIED BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AND DATA ANALYTICS TO ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE STUDENT LIFECYCLE THAT DRIVE STRONGER OUTCOMES FOR ADULT LEARNERS. THIS RAPID CYCLE ARE INDEED HELPS IS QUICKLY BUILD ON LESSONS LEARNED IN OUR VERY HUMAN POWERED STUDENT SUPPORT SYSTEMS. TO BE ABLE TO TEST NEW IMPROVEMENTS AND INCORPORATE THEM QUICKLY TO SCALE WHAT WORKS. AND THE VALUE OF THESE EFFORTS EXTEND BEYOND OUR STUDENTS TO CALIBRATE. BY ADDRESSING THIS YEAR CHALLENGERS THAT WE FACE ACROSS THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR FOR MOST OF MY CAREER. WORKING TO EXPAND EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY. AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HIGHER EDUCATION ADVISER AND LEAD INITIATIVES LIKE THE COLLEGE SCORECARD SIMPLIFYING THE FASTER. AND IMPLEMENTING OVERSIGHT OF PREDATORY FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. LIKE ALL OF YOU I RECOGNIZE THE PRIVILEGE AND RESPONSIBILITY IT IS TO BE A PUBLIC SERVANT. AND FOR ME I ARE WORKING CALVET IS VERY PERSONAL. AND REFLECTS THIS UNIQUE MOMENT WERE SPONSORED IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND THEY AREN'T COMING BACK. WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHY. HIGHER HIGHER EDUCATION PATTERN IN. AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ON HOLD GOING FORWARD UNLESS WE ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN ISSUES. WE SEE THIS IN OUR OWN DATA 90% OF STUDENTS TO CALIBRATE. SHARE THAT OUR UNIQUE MODEL IS WHAT ME THEIR PROGRAM ACCESSIBLE 26% OF THE NATION'S ENROLLMENT DECLINE DURING THE PANDEMIC CAME FROM CALIFORNIA. IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM HAS LOST MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS. ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF CAMPUSES OBSCENE AND WRONG STABILIZE. AND THOSE STUDENTS WHO WE ARE LOSING AT HIGHS RATES ARE CONFRONTING UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES IN THEIR LIVES THE EXACT LEARNERS THE CALVERT WAS CREATED TO SERVE. OUR MOMENT REFLECTS OUR PURPOSE AND OUR MISSION 92% OF OUR THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SYSTEM WIDE RATE 24% BLACK OUR STUDENT BODY IDENTIFIES BY PARK. AND THEY COME TO US FROM FORTY COUNTIES TWENTY TO RURAL. AND MORE THAN ONE IN THREE ARE PARENTS OR CAREGIVERS SISTERS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE SYSTEM WOULD RATE. HIGHER EDUCATION WAS NOT BUILT TO SERVE THE STUDENTS WELL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND CERTAINLY NOT DURING. CALIBRATORS MISSION CRITICAL BECAUSE WE NEED AN INSTITUTION WITH A DEDICATED FOCUS ON SOLVING FOR THE COMPLEX CHALLENGES. FACING LEARNERS OTHERWISE LEFT BEHIND. CALIBRATE IS THE FLEXIBLE SKILLS BASED PUBLIC OPTION CALIFORNIANS NEED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PREDATORY FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. AND IT IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF SOLVING THE COMPLEX EQUATION. REQUIRED TO BUILD A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY AND MORE EQUITABLE EDUCATION SYSTEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS MORNING. AND ALSO JOINED BY BOARD OF TRUSTEES PRESIDENT PAMELA HAINES AND WE ARE HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THAT THERE ARE A SERIES OF- QUESTIONS HERE FOR YOU I KNOW SOME OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WANT TO ENGAGE BUT THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY OR ANOTHER COMMITTEES AS WELL- ALL START OFF WITH MR O'DONNELL. THANK YOU AND WHAT'S YOUR OFFICIAL TITLE IT'S THAT PRESIDENT AND CEO PRESENCIA OKAY WHEN I CHANCELLOR AS A COLLEGE YOU KNOW I I'M NOT ATTACHED TO THE TITLE I THINK I'M ATTACHED TO THE PURPOSE OF MAKING A CHANCELLOR. IT'S MORE ACADEMIC. AT WE WILL TAKE THAT UNDER ADVISEMENT- HAPPY TO HEAR THAT SUGGESTION ARE MORE APPRECIATE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. AND I THINK YOU'RE KIND OF A TOUGH SPOT- BUT APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO RIGHT THE SHIP. BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE IS ANY WRITING UP THE SHIP QUITE FRANKLY I'M NOT SOLD ON THE CALIBRATE EXPERIMENT TODAY- I REMAIN SOMEWHAT OPEN MINDED OVER LAST YEAR. BECAUSE YOUR CHANCELLOR OF PRESS IN THE UPON ME TO DO THAT BUT I DON'T SEE A LOT OF SUCCESS TODAY- AND I WANT TO SEE SUCCESS AND I JUST WONDER IF THIS WOULD BE BETTER FULL IT UNDER AN EXISTING. A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. BUT THAT TO ME- SEEMS TO BE THE APPROPRIATE THING EVEN A FUNDING MODEL HERE IS VERY UNIQUE TONS OF MONEY. BUT NOT TONS OUTCOME. QUITE FRANKLY- NO REGULAR. ADOPTED YES THEY WERE NOT IN THE BACK TO BACK ON OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON IT. AND I'M SORRY BY THE SPEAKER YES SIR WE DID ACTUALLY LEAN INTO THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS AND IN FACT IN MANY WAYS. THE AUDIT CERTAIN IMPORTANT PURPOSE FOR DEVELOPMENT AS AN INSTITUTION. OUT WE LEANED INTO THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE USE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND TO REALLY STRENGTHEN A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WAS UNDER WAY WHEN I FIRST TOOK THE HELM. AT THOSE KEY IMPROVEMENTS ARE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH A LOT OF- BUT SO FAR WE TURNED EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO THE DELIVERABLE SCHEDULE THAT THE AUDITOR HAS PRESCRIBED AND WE CONTINUE TO STAY ON TRACK IN THAT REGARD. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DIGITAL FEEDBACK FROM THE AUDITOR TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE TO OUR SUBMISSION- AND AS YOU KNOW THERE WAS SEVERAL TIME TABLES LAID OUT IN THAT ADIT FOR MONITORING AND WE CONTINUE TO IT HERE TO THE US. AND YOUR CREDIT YOU REALLY INHERITED A MESS OVER THERE I RECOGNIZE THAT DUE TO SOME. SOME PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. BUT LET'S GO BACK TO THE TO THE TO THE EMPLOYEES OR SIXTY TWO FULL TIME EMPLOYEES TWENTY FIVE CONTRACTORS RIGHT. SO SIXTY TWO PLUS TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN. THERE'S NINE. TEACHERS THERE. NINE SO ME OUT I'M OKAY K. FACULTY HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE RAY THERE THAT'S ALL AWFUL LOT OF NON TEACHING STAFF WITH NO UNIVERSITY TO TOUCH RIGHT- I ASSUME YOU HAVE AN OFFICE BUT REALLY THERE'S NO PLACE FOR STUDENTS TANGIBLE- TO ARRIVE AT TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS A HOW IS IT. THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WORKING THERE. AND SO IF YOU FACULTY AND QUITE FRANKLY THE OUTCOMES SEEM A LITTLE BIT NEBULOUS AS WELL. YES IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT WE'RE STILL ACTUALLY QUITE EARLY IN THE STAGE OF OUR SEVEN YEAR START A PERIOD ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH AND SO WHILE WE HAVE NINE FULL TIME FACULTY THIS YEAR YOU'LL SEE HAS INCREASED BY ABOUT 60% TO FIFTEEN FACULTY. AND THAT'S IN DIRECT RELATION TO THE WAY THAT WE'RE GROWING OUR PROGRAMS AND OUR ROLE IN IT BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT OTHER PEOPLE TOUCH STUDENTS AT OUR INSTITUTION WE HAVE FOLKS ON THE FRONT LINE ENGAGED IN STUDENT INTERACTIONS. THAT ARE BEYOND OUR FACULTY STUDENT SUPPORT SPECIALIST FOLKS WERE SUPPORTING STUDENTS TECHNOLOGY NEEDS AND IT IS A FULL HANDS ON DECK EFFORT WITH EVERYTHING FOCUSED ON THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE. AS A WHILE OUR STAFFING REFLECTS THAN WHAT WAS NEEDED TO PUT IN THE STRUCTURE AS AN INSTITUTION AT TO PREPARE US FOR SCALING ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND WHAT WE WILL SEE NOW IS A LOT MORE HIRING AND FOCUSED ON- THOSE ARE ON THE FRONTLINES OF THAT STUDENT SUPPORT AND STUDENT TEACHING ASPECT OF THINGS. SO GIVEN THAT YOU HAVE NINE FACULTY. AND WHAT A THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT WE NEED THAT MEANS EACH FACULTY MEMBER HAS ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS WELL AGAIN THEY'RE SUPPORTED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- FOLKS CENTER CAMPUS AND WHAT THIS PREPARES US TO DO TO HAVE THE FULL TIME FACULTY QUORUM PLACE IN THE STUDENTS IMPORTANT PLACE IN THE TECHNOLOGY IN PLACE. IS IT ALLOWS US TO DIAL UP AND SAID ACT ASSIST TO PREPARE FOR THE SCALE WE HAVE A VERY FOCUS GROWTH PLAN THAT'S BEEN APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO GO FROM. OF THE FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS THAT WE HAD IN THE SUMMER TO FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO IT IS NOT WITHOUT A AT THE CORE SET OF PLANS AND OBJECTIVES TO IT TO HOW IT SCALES WE HAVE TO. BUT EXPERIENCE IN THE IN. IN PLACE BEFORE WE SEE. BECAUSE GROWTH NOT JUST ABOUT. IT IS. ABOUT ACT. REALLY BEING ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE QUALITY OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND OTHER STEPS I WILL JUST MENTION LIKE ACCREDITATION AND ALL THOSE THINGS. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT STAT STAGES IN THE COLLEGES DEVELOPMENT PRESS PROCESS THAT. ALSO ALLOW US TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU LIKELY HAVE AROUND. WHAT IS OUR FUTURE REVENUE MODEL LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF. AT GOING FORWARD HOW WE DECIDE AND DEVELOP A FUNDING MODEL. AT ALWAYS CONTEMPLATED UNDER LEGISLATION TO SCALE OUR ABILITY TO COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION PROGRAM NOT JUST TECH HELP RIGHT BUT ACROSS THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. YOU KNOW WHAT I NOTICE WITH CALVERT EVERY TIME THEY COME UP HERE AND I DON'T I'MNOT GONNA ASK YOU RESPOND TO THIS COMMENT IS IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN. IS ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN WE NEED MORE MONEY. WE NEED MORE STAFF BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S HAPPENING. AND I THINK THE DATA REFLECTS THAT ONE THOUSAND. EIGHTY GRADUATES. FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN WITHDRAWALS. NOT DEFENSIBLE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. ESPECIALLY WITH THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY THAT'S GOING INTO THIS PROGRAM AS A STUDENT MONEY. MONEY MEANT FOR STUDENTS. AND IT LOOKS TO ME. LIKE IT'S GOING TO HIRE EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM OR EVEN THE VIRTUAL CLASSROOM. THANK IS A REAL ISSUE HERE- STUDENT TO TEACHER RATIO AND ALL THESE FOLKS I KNOW YOU'VE MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT WE NEED THEM WE NEED THEM. BUT EVERY TIME. CALVET HERE WE NEED THIS WE NEED THIS AND IT'S GONNA HAPPEN IT'S GONNA HAPPEN. I JUST DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING TODAY. I THINK MISTER CHAIR WE NEED TO END THIS EXPERIMENT. I KNOW IT WAS WELL INTENTIONED. BUT I THINK- IF THERE IS SUCH A PROGRAM THAT SHOULD EXIST IT SHOULD EXIST. UNDER AN EXISTING- COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT TO ME IS THE NO BRAINER AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO RECREATE THE WHEEL. OR EVEN PERFECT WE'LL ONE ALREADY EXISTS. I DOWN THE ROAD HERE IN SACRAMENTO- SO- I. I'M NOT CONVINCED TODAY I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING- BUT I'M JUST NOT CONVINCED TODAY THAT THIS IS A PATH WE SHOULD KEEP GOING DOWN BACK TO YOU. CHAIR YEAH YOU- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE TO MISTER MEDINA. SO I REALIZE WE HAVE ONGOING MONEY AND ONE TIME WHEN THERE'S THIS IS A BUNCH OF THE ONE TIME STILL THERE. AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE A LOT OF MONEY ON GOING FOR THAT HE PEOPLE SO IT'S I GUESS LIKE TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER EMPLOYEE BUT MAYBE IT'S YOUR START UP IN LOCAL CHANGE. BUT I GUESS THE BIGGEST ISSUE. THAT I WANT TO RAISE IS WHEN THIS WAS CREATED. BEFORE YOU WERE AROUND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY THE MOST COMPETENT PERSON IN THIS ENTITY HERE THAT WE'VE SEEN. BUT IT HAS ZERO TO DO WITH YOU IT'S ABOUT THIS MISSION TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA AND WHAT ELSE WE DO SO WHEN THIS IDEA WAS PROPOSED I THINK FOUR YEARS AGO. TWENTY TWO TWENTY EIGHTEEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC IT WAS A DIFFERENT WORLD. AND WE JUST HAD. ISSUE NUMBER ONE THEY CAN'T COUNT COLLEGES TALK ABOUT HOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE ONLINE. AND THIS IS THAT WAS THE REASON WHY THIS WAS CREATED BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A LOT OF ONLINE STUFF AND MISS NAVARETTE JUST ARTICULATE THIS IS THE FUTURE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES STUDENTS ARE VOTING WITH THEIR FEET. THEIR FINGERS THEIR IPHONE OR THEIR COMPUTER TO SIGN UP WHEN THEY GO ON A ROLL. THEY PRIORITIZE ONLINE AND I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE BUSY COMMITTEE COSTUMES ARE OLDER. AND JOBS ARE FAMILIES ARE LESS FLEXIBLE AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SO THEY'RE DOING THIS ONLINE STEPS IF WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND TEN COLLEGES WHO ARE THRIVING AND THEIR FACULTY ARE LEARNING HOW TO DO. ZOOM EDUCATION NOW WHY DO WE NEED THIS EXPERIMENT IT SEEMS THAT IT WAS EXPERIMENTS AND IT'S NOT WORKING AND I CONCUR THAT. WE'RE GONNA ZERO FUN THIS ONCE AGAIN THAT'S OUR DESIRE HERE IN THIS BODY- AND THEN THE SECOND PIECE. IS THAT WHEN THIS WAS PROPOSED TO US THE NOTION WAS WE'RE GOING AFTER THE STRANDED. STRANDED CALIPHS IT'S- THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AN ALTERNATE SERVER SHASTA COUNTY OR YOU KNOW EAST OF. YOUR AREA MR MEDINA WHO WHO DON'T HAVE EDUCATION DON'T HAVE ACCESS SO THEY NEED THIS ONE WE JUST WE HAVE THAT THAT EARLIER CUNY COLLEGES ARE NOW DOING. MORE THAN HALF OF THE STUFF ONLINE. BUT ALSO THE NOTION WAS YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO FOCUS ON PEOPLE. WITH LIMITED EDUCATION BACKGROUND AND I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I THINK THOSE PEOPLE NEED A COLLEGE TO GO TO EXISTENCE WE NEED ACADEMIC SUPPORT THEY DON'T REALLY DO WELL ON YOU TO THE UNIVERSITY THEY NEED PEOPLE TO HELP THEM PAY I KNOW IT'S A TOUGH. ASSIGNMENT YOU GOT A BAD GRADE HERE BUT YOU KNOW KEEP GOING TO DO X. Y. Z. SO IT NEEDS TO SUPPORT I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO THAT ONLINE BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME HYBRID WE AT IN PERSON. BUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE 33% OF YOUR STUDENTS WHO HAVE BACHELOR'S DEGREES SO OF YOUR- SO CALLED A THOUSAND STUDENTS HERE AT OF COMPLETED. THAT'S THE POPULATION THAT WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO FOCUS ON YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FOCUS 1100% ON PEOPLE. WITHOUT BACHELOR'S DEGREES WITHOUT ANY COLLEGE THAT WAS WHAT YOU SOLD US WITH. FOUR YEARS AGO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE. BARELY A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE OR DROP OUT TRYING TO GET BACK IN THE COLLEGE GAME WHO WHO NEEDED SKILLS TO ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS AND SELL. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S THIS SCOPE SHAFT. AND THAT YOU KNOW WE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THIS PANDEMIC HAS HAS MADE THINGS. VERY VERY VERY DIFFERENT SO. CHAMBER GALGIANI YEAH LESS THAN YES I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE RESPONSE IT WOULDN'T IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A LOT OF THEIR INTERVAL WITH ME RESPONDING NUMBER OPEN I'D LIKE TO UNPACK A COUPLE THINGS IF YOU'LL LET ME THAT THE FIRST THING IS REALLY AND THIS QUESTION AROUND THE AND THAT 30% OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE COME TO US WITH BATCHES DEGREES IS A VERY INTERESTING ONE THAT WERE UNPACKING RIGHT NOW AT LARGELY BECAUSE MOST OF THE STUDENTS WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR CRM PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE BILL CAME TO US FROM THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT SYSTEM WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE- FACING AT POINT IN TIME ECONOMIC DISLOCATION. AND SOMETHING IS TRYING THEM TO OPEN ACCESS INSTITUTIONS AND WE ACTUALLY SURVEY OUR STUDENTS AND WE YOU KNOW OUR OUR AGE DEMOGRAPHIC IS HIGHER IN TERMS OF THE AVERAGE AGE OF STUDENT THAN REGULAR THAT THE REST OF THE SYSTEM IS AND BUT WHEN WE SURVEY THEM 90% OF THEM TALK ABOUT OUR FLEXIBLE MOBILE AND THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY JUST ABOUT BEING ONLINE THAT IS ACTUALLY ABOUT BEING A SKILLS BASED COMPETENCY BASED MODEL- THAT'S DESIGNED AROUND AT THE LEARNER'S NEEDS AN ASYNCHRONOUS NOT TIED TO THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR AT. AS RESTRICTIVE IN NATURE AND WHEN WE LOOK AT WHO HAS FALLEN OUT OF OUR THIS IS. JUST CALVET. COLLEGE THIS IS COMMUNITY. A THE- IT IS THIS POP. OF LEARNERS. SO WE ARE ABSOLUTELY FOCUSED ON- ESPECIALLY NON DEGREED INDIVIDUALS BUT WE'RE ALSO UNPACKING. WHAT IS HAPPENED IN THE COURSE OF SOMEONE'S LIFE THAT THEY'RE SUFFERING FROM. UNEMPLOYMENT EVEN WITH A DEGREE. AND IT WASN'T AT THE HIGHER LEVEL HM A CRACK AT THAT THEY'RE COMING TO US FOR. RESKILLING OPPORTUNITIES AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS AND- I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME FOR. THIS BODY TO CONSIDER AND TO UNDERSTAND AS- WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. WE ARE DEFINITELY A PART OF IT AND WE'RE A KEEP IMPORTANT FEATURE IN THAT LANDSCAPE BECAUSE- EVERYTHING THAT WE LEARN AND CAN CONTRIBUTE. CAN BE SHARED ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND THIS IS NOT A POPULATION FRANKLY THAT WE'RE DOING WELL WITH THAT AGAIN THAT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA THAT'S AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION RIGHT NOW. YEAH SO LET'S GO HE WENT ON PASSING THINGS HOW ABOUT THAT THE- ISSUE I THINK IS THE OVERWHELMING ONE IS WHEN WE- STARTED THIS. THIS PROPOSAL FOUR YEARS AGO. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE THIS AND THE FACULTY THE- OPPOSES NOW I REALIZE YOU HAVE. NO A DOZEN SO PEOPLE THAT MAY HAVE A UNION CONTRACT YOU KNOW THE LINES HAD. CONCERN AND ALL THE THINGS IS THAT IS HEY WE CAN DO THIS AND ARGUMENT FROM CALIBRATORS WELL YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT YOU DON'T DO THIS YOU'RE NOT THAT'S NOT YOUR MISSION YOU'RE NOT ONLINE. AND WE SAID HEY WE SHOULD HAVE A FEW COMMUNITY COLLEGES GIVE THEM. OPPORTUNITY TO GROW THEIR ONLINE PRESENCE WHY REINVENT THE WHEEL. WELL NOW WE HAVE ALL THIS ONLINE BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC SO IS THIS A BIT OF DUPLICATION. OF A HUNDRED AND TEN COLLEGES THAT DO THIS. VERY WELL AND I I'D ARGUE- YOU KNOW. THEY'VE THEY'VE FIGURED OUT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE AND SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE PUMPING YOU KNOW- GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD TO THIS SO. WHY WOULD WE CONTINUE WITH THIS EXPERIMENT WE HAVE OVER HERE A BUNCH OF COLLEGES A HUNDRED THE NOW DO ONLINE. VERY WELL. THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT A POPULATION THAT WE'RE DOING WELL WITH. THE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION FREE. CERTIFICATION ACROSS OUR HIRED INSTANCE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE SEE VERY LOW RATES OF COMPLETION OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD WITH THIS POPULATION OF LEARNERS SO IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT BEING ONLINE BUT IT IS ACTUALLY ABOUT HAVING A MODEL. THAT ALLOWS US TO- STRUCTURE AROUND THE NEEDS OF THE LEARNERS AND THAT IS AGAIN ASYNCHRONOUS NOT TIED TO THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR NOT JUST ONLINE BUT SKILLS BASED BASED ON THE MASTERY OF SKILLS. OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE NOT DOING WELL WITH COMPLETION OVER THERE. BUT WE'VE DONE A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS EXPERIMENT. AND YOU. HAVE TO BIRD EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COME YEAH. SO HOW COULD YOU CRITICIZE THE SYSTEM WHEN READ A GREAT FAILURE. FROM YOU ALL WITH COMPLETING PEOPLE YEAH AND IT'S NOT EXACTLY A CRITICISM OF THE SYSTEM IS THE REALITY THAT THOSE SYSTEMS ARE NOT REALLY BUILT. LIKELY NOT GOING OUT YES ABSOLUTELY. PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUCCEEDED. THE EIGHTY. EIGHTY PEOPLE ROUGHLY IN THIS ROOM AND OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW. YES SELL SELL THOSE ARE NOT ROUTINELY AND WE- CERTAINLY DO NOT RISK WE RE AT SATISFIED WITH MISLEADING. WE FOCUS ON. CYNICAL AND THEN. IN THAT. THAT YOU CAN AFFECTS. SUCCESS SO WE REALIZE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE IMPROVEMENTS WE'VE AND- AT THE COLLEGE IS THAT WE GET STUDENTS. AND ON THE RIGHT TRACK SO WHEN YOU KNOW JUST EVEN LOOKING AT IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS AGO SOME SORT OF SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS IN THE COURSE OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. IN JUST THIS PERIOD WITH IMPROVEMENTS WITH INTERVENTION WITH EFFORT AND WITH ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR STUDENTS WE'VE SEEN THAT SHORTENED BY TWO MONTHS AND SO WE KNOW WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND WE KNOW THAT. A LOT OF THE STUDENTS THAT ARE COMING INTO OUR INSTITUTION NOW WILL RECEIVE THAT IMPROVED VERSION OF THE EXPERIENCE. THAT WILL CONDITION THEIR SUCCESS WE'LL SEE AN UPTICK IN COMPLETIONS OVER A PERIOD OF- THE COMING SUMMER FALL EXCEPT TRACK. AT WHEN THE FLOW OF THE STUDENTS AT THAT TIME TO COMPETE THEIR COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAMS. SO DO YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT THAT WE'VE SPENT ROUGHLY ONE POINT FIVE. MILLION DOLLARS. PER INDIVIDUAL WHO'S GOT A CERTIFICATE. THAT CALIFORNIA FOR WEEKS GIVEN- OVER HOW MILLION DOLLARS. ON GOING AND WHAT TIME TO RIGHT. WE HAVE EIGHTY PEOPLE WITH A CERTIFICATE AND- WE DON'T KNOW HOW MOST PEOPLE HAD DEGREES IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. WE WOULD JUST NOT GOOD INVEST FOR YOU. I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL I'VE KNOWN PER PERSON I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL INVESTMENT TO OF FOR US TO MAKE OVER THE- YEARS THAT ARE DONE. WHEN YOU PUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. PER GRADUATE AT YEAH I ABSOLUTELY WOULD BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T EXPENDED DOWN THAT THE FULL SCOPE OF THAT RESEARCH HAS BEEN QUITE JUDICIOUS WITH THE WAY WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE WE'RE FOCUSED ON ENHANCING QUALITY SPENT. A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED MILLION SO FAR. AT WITH THREE YEARS OF ONGOING PLUS THE ONE TIME. TWICE WE HAVE NOT EXPENDED ALL OF THAT DOWN BUT BUT YES TO PUT INTO PLACE TO START OF INFRASTRUCTURE ABSOLUTELY THAT CAN SCALE AND THEN OVER TIME AS YOU I THINK EARLIER POINTED OUT WE WILL DO THE MATH HERE WELCOME BACK BUT I'M I'M- PRETTY SURE IT'S ROUGHLY. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR NORTH OF ONE WELL NORTH OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER GRADUATE- HELLO MR MEDINA WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT. THE AUDIT THAT HE'S PARTICIPATED IN. CERTI MORE TWO MORE ISSUES ON SHOULD THE JUMP INTO THAT WE TALK ABOUT HERE IN THE AGENDA- WHY DO YOU THINK THERE BEEN SO FEW. STUDENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR SHORT TERM PROGRAMS. THAT'S ONE THING YOU FOCUS ON IS FLEXIBILITY AND I GET A CLAIM CAL BRIGHT LIKE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES HAVE EASIER ENTRY. THE BEARS EVENTUALLY ARE DIFFERENT THAN ROLLING ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR LIKE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE. SO FOR THE SHORT TERM PROGRAMS WHY DO WE HAVE SO FEW STUDENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED. IT'S A IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND WE LOOK AT IT VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE RIGHT SAID ACUTE INSTITUTIONAL PRIORITY FOR US. AND WHAT WE FIND IS THAT WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO REACH STUDENTS AND INTERACT WITH STUDENTS WE SEE THE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE MAKE IN THOSE INTERVENTIONS. THING TO SUPPORT THEM THROUGH WHAT IS USUALLY A VERY CHALLENGING TIME IN THEIR LIFE WITH A LOT OF COMPETING PRIORITIES AT THE SAME TIME WE BALANCE THE NEED THAT WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLETIONS WITH THE GRACE THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE STUDENTS IN THE REALITIES THAT THAT THEY'RE- FACING. AT THAT DRAWS THEM TO A SELF PACED KIND OF PROGRAM SO WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE ASKING OURSELVES ARE WE DOING EVERYTHING INSTITUTIONALLY POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS THROUGHPUT- AND SO WHEN WE SEE THOSE EARLY INDICATORS OF SUCCESS AT THE BEGINNING END OF THE PROCESS THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING WITH OUR STUDENTS THE WAY THAT OUR COUNSELORS AND OUR STUDENTS SUPPORT SPECIALIST. INTERACT WITH OUR STUDENTS ON A VERY REGULAR BASIS TO SUPPORT AND ALSO TO RECOGNIZE TIMES IN WHICH THEY MEET NEED MORE TIME OR TO BREAK- THOSE ARE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE HAVE HAD IMPLEMENTED A SERIES OF DIFFERENT SUPPORTS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE. A YEAR AGO SO YOU KNOW EVERY SIX MONTHS EVERY DAY REALLY WE ARE IMPROVING UPON WHAT WE'RE DOING AND IMPLEMENTING THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND- I THINK THAT'S PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THAT THE TIME THE TIME FRAMES IN WHICH STUDENTS. ACHIEVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE- AND THE WAY THEY ENTER INSTITUTIONS DOESN'T REFLECT WHAT WAS THERE SIX MONTHS AGO IT REFLECTS AN IMPROVED EXPERIENCE AND THAT'LL CONTINUE THANK YOU. I'LL LET MISTER MEDINA FOCUS ON THE THEIR AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ONE LAST QUESTION HERE SO AS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THERE IS A BILL. TO ELIMINATE- CALIBRATE WHICH IS YOU KNOW STILL- TO THE SENATE ABILITY. TO YOUR BILL CERVANTES AND THEN THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO- NOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR BUDGET PUSH ZERO FINANCE- I. THE BILLS YOU NAY. IN ASSEMBLY- I ONLY MET ONE LAWMAKERS. CAL RIGHT OUT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY SO MAYBE HAVE OTHERS BUT I'VE SEEN ONE- LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SAID BERNIE GIVE YOU ONE MORE YEAR. ESSENTIALLY TO US IS LIKE I REALIZE YOU'RE ZERO FUNDING IT. HOW MANY GIVEN ONE MORE YEAR. TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER. AND SHOW SUCCESS SO DO YOU THINK THAT YOU YOU DO YOU THINK THIS ENTITY HAS SHOWN SUCCESS IN ONE YEAR TO PROVE ITS WORTHINESS BASED UPON THE NUMBERS WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY I ABSOLUTELY DO AND EXPLAIN WHY WITH EIGHTY GRADUATES THAT THOUSAND STUDENTS I ABSOLUTELY DO BECAUSE WE'RE SOLVING A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM FOR A GROUP OF LEARNERS THAT HASN'T BEEN SOLVED FOR IN THE SYSTEM. AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK OF SOLVING THOSE THINGS BOTH BECAUSE WE'RE MEETING WITH ALL OF THE EXPECTATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SET OUT FOR US BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY AT BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THOSE EARLY SIGNS OF SUCCESSES AND SO THE FACT THAT WE NEED TIME TO ACTUALLY BUILD MORE OUT FROM THE INSTITUTION AS WAS ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED IN THE LEGISLATION THAT KIND OF SEVEN YEAR TO START OF TIME FRAME. I BELIEVE WE'RE TRACKING TOWARDS AND WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO HAVE A GREAT TEAM IN PLACE COMING FROM A WHOLE RANGE OF PUBLIC NONPROFIT AND AT PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERIENCES M. WE HAVE THE TEAM IN PLACEI'VE BEEN FINALLY ABLE TO PUT THE TEAM IN PLACE TO CARRY THISWORK FORWARD AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING SO MUCH PROGRESS AND IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR EXAMPLE. I DON'T I CAN'T SEE HOW YOU SAVE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS WITH THAT. WHEN YOUR GOAL WAS TO FOCUS ON PEOPLE WITH LIMITED EDUCATION AND A THIRD OF YOUR STUDENTS. HAVE BACHELOR'S DEGREES. AS IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE LIKE I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE SELLING YOURSELF- YOU MISTER MEDINA. THE THIS YEAR- I WILL TAKE THIS BACK TO WIN THIS- I EIGHT. RIGHT YEAH THAT WAS THE LITTLE CONFUSED FOR THAT. RIGHT AND IS THIS. TAKE US BACK TO THE BEGIN AND WHO THE STUDENTS WERE GONNA BE AND WHAT THIS PRO WAS A FOR AND IT WAS VERY MUCH THE THERE WAS A NICHE OF STUDENTS OF THOSE ARE NOT STUDENTS A NICHE OF WORKERS ACTUALLY RIGHT WHO WERE UNSKILLED I NEEDED TO IMPROVE. THEIR SKILLS. PEOPLE IN THE-WORKFORCE WHO DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO- TO EDUCATION. AND THAT THIS NICHE WAS OUT THERE- THAT IT WAS NEEDED THAT THIS NEW ENTITY COULD MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE WORKING INDIVIDUALS. RIGHT- THE OTHER ENTITIES MAYBE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. WE'RE TAPPING IAN TAPPING IN TO THE STUDENTS OR TO THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO NEEDED TO IMPROVE- THEIR SKILLS. AND IT WAS THEM WHO THE PROGRAM WAS INTENDED FOR. AND THAT THERE WAS A GREAT NEED. FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES ADULT ED DIDN'T MEET THE NEED FOR. AND SO I WOULD AGAIN POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE- AND THAT THAT SUCH LOW NUMBERS DOESN'T SHOW- THE NEED FOR IT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT- THE WORKERS- IN THE WORK FORCE SO I HAVEN'T SEEN IT BEEN DEMONSTRATED- THAT THE NEED IS THERE. GIVEN THE LOW NUMBER OF- FEW STUDENTS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED SINCE THE INCEPTION DO DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN ANY WAY IN THE PROGRAM IN THE FOUR YEARS RIGHT IN THE FOUR YEARS THAT. THREE YEARS THAT ITS EXISTENCE I DON'T HAVE THE RUNNING TOTAL I HAVE OUR CURRENT ENROLLMENTS BUT I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT INFORMATION IF IT'S HELPFUL TO. THE RIGHT NOW IT'S ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS RIGHT ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND EIGHTY IS THE TOTAL OF HAPU HAVE FINISHED- IT IN IN ALL THE TIME THAT COD RIGHT AS BEEN. IN EXISTENCE YES YES SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN HOME LET'S SAY SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THAT AND- OKAY. YEAH I DON'T SEE WHERE THE FIGURES SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THAT WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS WAS NEEDED- SO BADLY. BECAUSE THE NUMBERS JUST HAVEN'T BEEN THERE- IN A ROMAN IN GRADUATION CAME UP HOW MANY OF THE GRADUATES OF THE- EIGHTY RIGHT THE QUESTION CAME UP HOW MANY OF THEM HAVEBEEN ABLE TO. TO GET JOBS AND TO GET JOBS IN THE FIELD THAT THEY TRAIN FOR. IS THAT DATA AVAILABLE. AT THE DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ACTIVE YET I'M ACTUALLY GLAD THAT YOU ASKED THAT BECAUSE M. WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON THE LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES IN ALL OF THE FORMS AND WE HAVE JUST RECENTLY ACTUALLY JOINED THE CCC LAUNCH BOARD AND SO WE'LL SEE DATA COMING OUT OF THAT- LIKELY IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS IT'LL BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT QUARTER. AND THAT THE DATA ITSELF IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GATHER FOR INSTITUTIONS AND SO WE ARE ACTUALLY SPENDING A LOT OF TIMES ON TIME ON BUILDING THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE FOR US TO COLLECT A LOT OF DIVERSE- TYPES OF LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES BECAUSE WHAT WE FIND WITH THIS. POPULATION OF LEARNERS AS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW THEY'RE EXPERIENCING THE EMPLOYMENT MARKET AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE KNOW THAT FOR SOME CASES. IT IS SCALING AND THE JOB THAT THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN IT BECAUSE THE SKILLS REQUIREMENTS ARE CHANGING IN SOME CASES IT IS GOING FROM AN HOURLY JOB TO EIGHTY AND- ADD TO A SALARIED JOB. AND PROVIDING SOME STABILITY IN THEIR WORK AND LIFE- SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES THAT WE DON'T EVEN CURRENTLY TRACK IN HIGHER ED GENERALLY OUT WERE IN THE WORK FORCE PROGRAMS THAT WERE ALSO SEEKING TO AT TO TRACK RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA WE FEEL THAT A AND- THAT ALUMNI SURVEY THAT HELPS US COLLECT SOME OF THAT SELF REPORTED DATA. BUT ULTIMATELY WERE WORKING TOWARDS MORE GLOBAL SOLUTIONS IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE WE NEED BETTER DATA ON EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES NOT JUST FOR CALIBRATE FOR HIRED AS A WHOLE AND SO SOME OF THESE METRICS WILL BE A KEY COMPONENT ABOUT THAT. AND ALL OF THAT IS VERY CLEARLY ACTUALLY LAID OUT IN TERMS OF OUR EFFORTS. IN OUR THREE YEAR STRATEGIC VISION THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO REALLY FOCUS ON THIS QUESTION OF- THE EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES IN ADDITION. COMES TO MAY- FOR YEARS IN THREE YEARS AND THIS PROGRAM OUT WITHOUT THAT DATA. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD REACH ANY KIND OF CONCLUSION AS TO THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM- TO THOSE EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS EVEN WHO COMPLETED IT OUT WITHOUT WITHOUT THAT KNOWLEDGE- WE DON'T HAVE THAT WE AT ALL. TO SEE YOU KNOW. HOW OF THEIR- JOB SITUATION IMPROVED- WERE THEY ABLE TO MOVE UP IN INCOME. WITH WITHOUT THAT I JUST DON'T SEE HOW YOU KNOW WE CAN DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS- ANSWER THAT WAS ALSO A KEY RECOMMENDATION OF THAT STATE AUDITOR TO AT THE ASKS A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE WOULD BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DATA COLLECTION AROUND THOSE THINGS TO MANY OF THOSE PLANS ARE. AT DEFINED IN OUR RESPONSE TO THE STATE AUDIT AND THEY JUST NEED TIME TO BE IMPLEMENTED AS WAS IN AGAIN ENVISIONED UNDER THE SEVEN YEAR STARTUP TIME FRAME. TO THE IDEA OF- I THINK I THINK IN HERE THERE IS SOME DISCUSSION. OF STARTING- THE NURSING PROGRAM. CORRECT A LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSING LICENSE VOCATIONAL ALBEIT WHICH WHICH WHICH WOULD YOU SAY THAT THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF WHAT KIND OF RIGHT WAS SET UP TO DO I DO NOT WORK OURS IS A COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT THE AUDITOR THEMSELVES RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENTIATION OF OUR MODEL THAT IT IS ASYNCHRONOUS THAT IS TARGET AROUND A PARTICULAR POPULATION OF LEARNERS THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR IT- SO. WE'RE REALLY RELYING ON ON THAT DEFINITION OF IT THE LPN PROGRAM IS PARTICULARLY UNIQUE BECAUSE OF ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH SEIU UNITED HEALTHCARE WORKERS- BECAUSE IT STANDS TO PRESENT A SCALABLE SOLUTION WITH A PARTNER WHO WILL SUPPORT THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT ASPECTS OF. THE PROGRAM ITSELF TO ADDRESS CRITICAL SHORTAGES IN THE STATE BUT ALSO REALLY TO DIVERSIFY THE PIPELINE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE FACILITATE MORE EQUITABLE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN MANY AREAS AND THAT OUR HEALTH CARE DESERT'S AT THIS IS A CORE PART OF AN ACCESS POINT THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AT CAN CAN REACH AN IN AN ACCESSIBLE WAY- WITH A PARTNER ON THE GROUND WHO CARES A LOT ABOUT THOSE WORKERS WHERE THE JOBS WILL HAVE MARKERS OF JOB QUALITY. WOULD YOU YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE ORIGINAL INTENT. OF THE PROGRAM THE LEGISLATION SPEAKS S. SERVE VERY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT- THE TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE COLLEGE TO HAVE. AND YOU KNOW LABOR IS IT IS A CRITICAL PARTNER FOR US THAT'S TRUE IN TERMS OF. AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING PROGRAMMATIC LEE WITH THAT CA YOU AND IT'S EQUALLY TRUE OF THE LABOR REPRESENTATION THAT OUR EMPLOYEES ENJOY A FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND- AT CSEA. THE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. BUT LV ENDS ARE- BEING TRAINED NOW BY COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT DO YOU HAVE LPN PROGRAMS NOT COMPETENCY BASED ASYNCHRONOUS SKILLS BASED PROGRAMS NOT THOSE WITH A CLINICAL PLACEMENT PARTNERS SO THERE'S MANY IMPORTANT AREAS OF DIFFERENTIATION. AND THEY'RE SEVERE UNDER PRODUCTION TO IN TERMS OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THEMSELVES. BUT WHAT I'M HOPEFUL IS- IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT WE'RE DESIGNING THE PARTNERSHIP IS THERE'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HAD THE OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE FACED. WITH RESPECT TO- HAVING MORE SCALABLE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THOSE PROGRAMS A CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AT FIRST FOR EXAMPLE TEND TO BE A BOTTLENECK IN THIS AREA AND IF WE LOOK AT PROGRAMS IN THE L. THE END SPACE THAT ARE. AT PARTICULARLY- IN THE QUEUE FOR APPROVAL FOR EXAMPLE- WHAT WE FIND IS MANY OF THEM ARE NOT ACTUALLY AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THIS CAN BE A VERY SUPPORTIVE MECHANISMS WHERE WE SEE AND THAT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CLINICAL PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT FLAT FRONT LINE HEALTH CARE WORKER ROLE AND IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO PARTNER WITH OTHER COMMUNITY. IS WHO ARE ALSO AT YOU NEED IN THAT REGARD AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN BE BUILT HERE THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THE WHOLE SYSTEM WE'RE WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROGRAM. YEAH WELL I WOULD SAY THAT IN CAN. FOR ME AND MY QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. I AS A AS A TEACHER. WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM AT THE OUTSET. BECAUSE AS I THINK THE CHAIR. HAS MENTIONED. THAT THIS GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE HIRED TO TRAIN. BECAUSE PERHAPS BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING A LOT OF EDUCATION ONLINE- WITHOUT A LOT OF- PERSONAL CONTACT TO ME DIDN'T DIDN'T SEEM TO JIVE YOU KNOW WHO THE STUDENTS WERE AND THE METHOD OF DELIVERY. AND THAT WAS A PRE PANDEMIC PRE GOING WAY UP ONLINE SO I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL CRITICAL OUTSET. WE'RE WE'RE NOW- AS BEEN POINTED OUT- FOUR YEARS IN AT LEAST INTO THE FUNDING OF IT- WE SEE THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF US- I WOULD GIVE YOU THAT THERE BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENTS I SOME IMPROVEMENTS SINCE THE ADDED- CERTAINLY- ADMINISTRATIVELY WE'VE SEEN. MUCH IMPROVEMENT- THERE AT LEAST WITH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE- WELL GRATEFUL FOR THAT- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY LEGISLATURE. IN FUNDING AND TO MAKE DECISIONS TO MAKE DECISIONS ON WHERE WE SPEND OUR MONEY AND- WHERE WE THINK WE GET MORE OF FOR OUR MONEY- AND WHERE THE STUDENTS DO SO- AGAIN WE'RE FACED WITH WITH WITH THE NUMBERS WERE FACED WITH HAVING TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF DISTANCE. I REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THAT I STILL HAVE- IN THE IN THE WORKS BUT LEGISLATION. THAT WOULD CALL FOR THE END OF COUNT RIGHT- IT'S AN- FORGET EXACTLY WHERE IT IS BUT- I SHARE MY COLLEAGUES- CONCERNS. THAT I'VE EXPRESSED OVER THE YEARS AND OUT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT IT IS THE BEST USE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS- VERY LIMITED RESOURCES WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION. THANK MR LEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- I'LL I'LL BE BRIEF JUST BECAUSE I'M RUNNING BETWEEN COMMITTEES BUT I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOU AND YOUR TEAM ARE DOING LIKE I SAID LAST YEAR YOU KNOW YOU ARE HANDED A- A HAND THAT IS THAT IS NOT FAVORABLE IN THIS REGARD AND- I CERTAINLY WAS NOT HERE WHEN CALVERT WAS INSTITUTED BUT STILL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A FAN OF EVEN PRE PANDEMIC I THINK REALLY WHAT OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING EVEN ARCADE AS WELL THE TWO CATIONS SESSION OF FIGURING OUT AS THEY CAN HAVE THE MEDITATION OF ONLINE LEARNING AND SOMETIMES I THINK WITH THE COMMUNITY ROOTED FOCUS OF EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THEY ARE MORE PREDISPOSITION TO BE A GATEWAY ACCESS OF VISUAL LEARNING HAVING MORE FLEXIBILITY I'M ALL FOR FREE I'M ALL FOR EXPERIMENTATION FIGURE OUT NEW THINGS CAN TRY THESE THINGS BUT I THINK EVEN IN THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME GIVEN THE RESULTS WERE SAYING IT'S NOT QUITE THE RESULTS YOU WANT TO SEE AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW REAL LIFE HAS ALSO CAUGHT UP IN THAT SENSE THE PANDEMIC SHOWED EVERYONE ELSE WITH DIGITAL EDUCATIONAL CLEAR DEAL ACCESS COULD LOOK LIKE AND AGAIN THAT'S OUT OF YOUR CONTROL YOU'RE TRYING TO YOUR DO YOUR BEST WITH THE CARDS YOU'RE DEALT. I STILL DON'T THINK I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TO THIS YEAR SO I SUPPORT OUR COLLEAGUES EFFORTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN REALLOCATE THESE RESOURCES ESPECIALLY INTO EXISTING FROM COLLEGE- SYSTEM RIGHT NOW THERE'S SO MANY STUDENTS IN NEED RIGHT NOW AND I THINK INSTEAD OF HAVING A NEW INFRASTRUCTURE CAN JUST REINVEST IN THE OLD INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOU'RE DOING YOUR TEAM AND I THINK YOU'RE STE YOUR QUESTION ON IT BUT AGAIN. DEALT WITH SOME TOUGH TOUGH HAND RIGHT THERE BUT. I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION HAVING TODAY. THANK YOU. FOR THE QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPENED- FOR THE SENATE ACTUALLY IS NO. YEAH WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE UP AND COME BACK AFTER MAY REVISING GO BACK TO THAT THE GENDER ISSUE NUMBER TWO THANK YOU COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPORTIONMENT FUNDING FORMULA. GOOD MORNING AGAIN DAN HAD OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO START I WOULD LIKE TO SIGNAL THE ADMINISTRATION'S ONGOING COMMITMENT TO THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA OR SCF CONDITIONS POSED BY THE LAST FEW YEARS THE FORMULA HAS PROVED RESILIENT AND A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE COLLEGES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES THE STATUTORY- I SEE IF HAVE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OF FIVE POINT THREE THREE PERCENT. WHICH TRANSLATES TO FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FURTHER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FUNDING FOR POINT 5% ENROLLMENT GROWTH. COMING TO TWENTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS MORE OF A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT IT PROVIDES FUNDING WHICH CAN BE USED BY DISTRICTS THAT HAPPENED TO BE GROWING- AND ANY UNUSED GROWTH FUNDING IS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO COVER INCREASES TO A DISTRICTS SUPPLEMENTAL SUCCESS ALLOCATIONS. THE ADMINISTRATION REMAINS FOCUSED ON MOVING TOWARDS FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FUNDING FORMULA. AS SUCH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED A GRADUAL PHASE OUT TO THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION OF THE SCF. THE EXISTING WILL THOMAS PROVISION IS SLATED TO EXPIRE AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO CREATE A FUNDING FOR USING TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FUNDING LEVELS. ALLOWING FUNDING RATES TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE BY THE STATUTORY COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. BUT REMOVING APPLICATION OF THE CODE TO THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. OBJECTIVELY THIS APPROACH ALLOWS DISTRICTS TO TRANSITION TO THE CORE FUNDING pFORMULA OVER TIME. OR PREVENTING PHYSICAL THE CLIENTS BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. THE EIGHT PAGES OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO SIGNAL INTEREST IN THE ADMINISTRATION. TO INCLUDE FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS WITHIN THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION OF THE SCF. IN LINE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION MADE BY THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. ONCE A RELIABLE AND STABLE DATA SOURCE IS AVAILABLE. ABOUT IT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS OKAY THANK YOU L. L. THANK YOU AUSTIN HOUSING AGAIN WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS YOUR GENDER DENOTES THE COST OF LIVING RATE FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHER THAN THE FIVE POINT 33% PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OUR OFFICE ESTIMATES ABOUT A SIX POINT 2% OF THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT- RATE WHICH WOULD COST ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES IS IN HIS JANUARY BUDGET. YOUR TURN A CARD IS YOU POINTED OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING. YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF COST PRESSURES OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CURRENTLY FIRST YOU HAVE- EMPLOYEES THEIR OWN COST OF LIVING. HAS GONE UP BECAUSE OF INFLATION SO THERE'S PRESSURE ON DISTRICTS PROVIDE TO PROVIDE PAY INCREASES. DISTRICTS OF ALSO HAVE REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO CALPERS AND CAL STIRS THE PENSIONS AND THAT'S EXPECTED TO GO UP BY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL IN THE BUDGET YEAR. NOW DISTRICTS ARE REALIZING SOME SAVINGS IN THE CURRENT YEAR BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RUNNING AS MANY- COURSE SECTIONS THERE'S SO THERE'S SOME SAVINGS FROM PART TIME FACULTY NOT NEEDING THOSE TEMPORARY FACULTY. DUE TO LOWER- ENROLLMENT DEMAND. RIGHT IF THAT TREND WERE TO CONTINUE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE DISTRICTS WILL CONTINUE TO SEE SAVINGS THOUGH LIKELY NOT ENOUGH TO OFFSET THE UPWARD PRESSURE THE DISTRICTS ARE EXPERIENCING IN THEIR BUDGETS. SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE MAKE A DECISION ON A CALL THE RATE. ONCE OF THE STATE GETS UPDATED INFORMATION- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY LATER THIS MONTH. AND THEN LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT UPDATED CALL THE RATE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE WHERE THAT'S TRENDING IT MAY REVISE AND MAKE A DECISION THEN ON THE KOLA. WITH REGARD TO THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA THE APPORTIONMENT FUNDING FOR THE COLLEGES- MISTER HAD OUR JUST DESCRIBED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION. NOW WHEN THE STATE CREATED THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS IT ENDED UP GENERATING LESS MONEY. UNDER THE NEW FORMULA THAN UNDER THE OLD FORMULA AND SO THE LEGISLATURE AGREED TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY FUNDING TO THOSE DISTRICTS THESE. SO CALLED HOLD HARMLESS FUNDING TO HELP THEM TRANSITION TO GIVE THEM TIME TO TRANSITION. NOW THE GOVERNOR HAS A PROPOSAL HERE THAT'S INTENDED TO PREVENT MANY DISTRICTS FROM HITTING A FISCAL CLIFF IN A FEW YEARS. THE STATE CURRENT HOLD HARMLESS VISION IS SCHEDULED TO END AND DISTRICTS ARE FUNDED BASED ON THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. SO WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF. SEVENTEEN A FISCAL CLIFF FOR THESE DISTRICTS IS LAUDABLE AT THE SAME TIME OF BEING A HOLD HARMLESS DISTRICT MEANS RECEIVING A PORTION OF FUNDING REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY STUDENTS THE DISTRICT'S SERVICE. REGARDLESS OF WHO THOSE STUDENTS ARE REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE STUDENTS SO BEING A HOLD HARMLESS DISTRICT GETTING MONEY NO MATTER WHAT REALLY CREATES A POOR INCENTIVES ON THOSE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE SHOULD STRIVE TO GET DISTRICTS OFFICE HOLD HARMLESS FUNDING. AND FUNDED BASED ON THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ONE WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA THROUGH BASE INCREASES. BEYOND THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S HOLD HARMLESS PROVOKED PROPOSAL. BUT GO FURTHER THAN THAT AND BEGIN EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF RAISING THE BASE FUNDING FOR THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA SO THE DISTRICTS ARE GENERATING MORE THROUGH IT THEN CURRENTLY. SO LEGISLATURE COULD DO SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT IT DID WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WITH K. TWELVE SET A- TARGET LEVEL OF BASE FUNDING. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO SEE- FOR THE CALL DISTRICTS FUNDED AT. AND THEN LOOK AT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE SO LOOK AT THAT GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEE AND THEN DEVELOP A MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR REACHING THOSE TARGETS. AND AT HIGHER BASE ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF HELPING DISTRICTS ADDRESS A HIGHER OPERATING COSTS GENERAL THE SNOW VERY BRIEFLY- FIRST WE DO WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT ADDING FIRST GENERATION METRIC TO THE STUDENTS SENDING. CENTER FUNDING FORMULA HAS MERIT- ONCE- THE LEGISLATURE IS ABLE TO GET BETTER DATA FROM THE DISTRICTS ON FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. WE ALSO DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE ABOUT FORTY DISTRICTS THAT ARE NOT ON A HOLD HARMLESS THERE FUNDED BY THE STUDENT CENTERED FORM FUNDING FORMULA BUT THEY'RE CURRENTLY BEING PROTECTED BY WHAT'S CALLED EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE. SO THIS IS MONEY THAT THEY'RE GETTING DUE TO THE PANDEMIC SO THEY'RE BEING FUNDED AT PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS AS IF THE PANDEMIC COULD NOT HIT. WELL THAT DEALS THOSE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCES WHICH IS AUTHORIZED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ARE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE. AT THE END OF THIS YEAR SO AT THE END OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE KIND OF A ONE YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD OF AND STARTING IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. YOU TO HAVE A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS TO START TO SEE A REDUCTION IN THE FUNDING LEVELS AND THEIR PORTION IT FUNDING. SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANTED TO ADD REQUEST THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE. ON THESE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE. WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO IF THEY DECIDED YET WHETHER TO EXTEND NEIGHBORS TO CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE FOR ANOTHER YEAR SO I THINK THEY'LL BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR LEGISLATORS OF. THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK OF- IN THE NEXT YEAR. AND CLOSING OUT THIS BUDGET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMUNITY COLLEGES. GOOD MORNING AGAIN WAS THAT NEVER WITH CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULAS KEY PART OF THE SOLUTION TO AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY AS YOU KNOW THAT STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA PROVIDES FUNDING FOR ACCESS AND ROMAN BASE FUNDING TO STUDENT EQUITY BY TARGETING- FUNDS TO DISTRICTS SERVING LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND FOR STUDENT SUCCESS BY PROVIDING DISTRICTS WITH RESOURCES FOR SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME THE FUNDING FORMULA DISTRICTS WERE FUNDED ALMOST ENTIRELY BY ENROLLMENT FUNDING SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT WE'VE LEARNED AS AN APPROACH THAT DID NOT WORK. IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ADVANCING THE STUDENTS FULL CHEN EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY BEYOND THE INITIAL ENROLLMENT AND IT WOULD NOT OF WORK IN THE MIDST OF THESE- DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS THAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE STATES- WHEN DISTRICTS HAVE SEEN ENROLLMENT DECLINES EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC- EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC DISTRICTS WERE EXPECTED TO LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND YOU TO ENROLLMENT DECLINES SO THE S. C. EFFORT RECOGNIZES THAT A COLLEGES WORK ENCOMPASSES- MORE THAN JUST ENROLLMENT. AND CRITICAL ACADEMIC AND STUDENT SUPPORT POINTS ALONG THEIR JOURNEY. WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSED TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR FUNDING FLOOR AND THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THIS CHAIN PROVIDES DISTRICTS WITH STABILITY- AS THEY WORK TO RE ENGAGE CALIFORNIA AND- FURTHER ON THE DRIVING TENANTS OF THE SCF OF ACCESS EQUITY AND SUCCESS. MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER AND REMIND US THAT STUDENTS COME FIRST. UNDER THE SCF WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE- SOME EARLY INDICATORS THAT SHOW THAT- STATEWIDE ASSOCIATE DEGREES. FOR TRANSFER COMPLETIONS BY LOW INCOME STUDENTS HAVE INCREASED BY ROUGHLY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN- TRANSFER LEVEL ENGLISH AND MATH- FOR FIRST GENERATE FOR FIRST YEAR LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT SIXTY NINE PERCENT. AND EVEN LARGER GAINS OF 89% FOR PELL RECIPIENTS- AND 90% INCREASE. FOR POP PROMISE GRANT RECIPIENTS. STAY WIDE LIVING WAGES FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS ARE ALSO UP BY 20% I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND COMMITTEE STAFF THEY PROVIDED AN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS AND SOUND RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND OTHER APPROACHES THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN INCLUDE- CAN CONSIDER SPECIFICALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A POINT THAT INCREASE IN THE SCFA BASE RATE WOULD HELP COLLEGES IN ADDRESSING SEVERAL CHALLENGES. NOT ONLY WHAT A HIGHER BASE RIGHT HELP DISTRICTS RESPOND TO RISING STAFF AND FACULTY COSTS AND PENSION PRESSURES BUT IT COULD HELP DISTRICTS FACING ENROLLMENT TO CRY DECLINES TO SOFTEN THAT ASSOCIATED FUNDING. ONE SOLUTION IS A- CONSIDERATION OF A THREE HUNDRED MILLION INCREASE- TO THE- BASIC ALLOCATION IN THE FORM OF A TECH BASIC TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE CLARA MANAGING NOW AND DO ALL CAMPUSES THAT ARE BOTH BRICK AND MORTAR- AND CLOUDBASE INSTITUTIONS. WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON THE STUDENT'S JOURNEY AS A NORTH STAR I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU IN THE NEXT MONTH IS HE FINALIZED THIS ITEM QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER DONNA YOU FOR THE PRESENTATIONS- JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS HERE I'M A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT IT A FIRM BELIEVER THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT IT BETTER THAN WE HAVE. AND ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO FUND IT ADEQUATELY AND I LOOK AT THE PROPOSED BUDGET. IT WAS IN JANUARY S. AND I REALIZE THIS IS A PROCESS. BUT A FIVE POINT WOEFULLY INADEQUATE- THAT GOES FOR THE K. TWELVE SIDE TO- AND WHY IS IT. WAS AND HOW IT WHAT I KEEP HEARING OUR HISTORIC NUMBERS A STORE NUMBERS HISTORIC NOT A HISTORIC INCREASE. THAT MATCHES- YOU KNOW HAVE. HISTORIC INFLATION. RIGHT THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN FORTY YEARS. SO THAT FIVE POINT 33% DOESN'T EVEN MEET INFLATION. LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE IF YOU TAKE THE- THE SCHOOL COST PRICE AND ACCESS MY OWN LITTLE ANIMAL I'VE CREATED I KNOW OTHERS HAVE THEIR OWN DEVICES BUT YOU TAKE. FIVE POINT THREE THREE AS THE OFFER IN THE IN THE JANUARY PROPOSED BUDGET THAT IS NOW IN OUR HANDS. FROM THE GOVERNOR. IF YOU LOOK AT CPI SOMEONE AVERAGE GET TWO POINT THREE FIVE. AND THEN YOU COME UP TO MAYBE 4% OTHER COSTS THAT ARE UNIQUE. TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES DECLINING ENROLLMENT SAID RIGHT NOW THERE'S SOME HELP THERE ON THE DECLINE IN ROMA- BUT- EASILY YOU'RE PROBABLY AT ABOUT 13% PLUS. COST PRESSURES MY COMMUNITY COLLEGES FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR SO FIVE POINT LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ADDRESS THAT- I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AROUND THE HOLD HARMLESS AND I THINK THE IDEA HERE. THE MECHANISM THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET IS REALLY A SLOPE MORE THAN A CLIFF. SOMETHING WE'RE SEEING A BIT ON THE K. TWELVE SIDE AS WELL. YEAH I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND TARGETING THE FUNDING ON A PER STUDENT LEVEL BUT I A TARGET. IS REALLY. UPROMISE AND DOLLARS ARE A COMMITMENT. AND WE CAN'T GET A JUST JUST SETTING UP TARGETS THAT WE MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT MEET. ARE MORE ASPIRATIONAL. THAN THEY ARE REALITY AND SO THIS YEAR WE HAVE MORE MONEY MORE ON GOING MONEY AND WE SHOULD PUTTHAT IS IT INTO THE BASE. SO THAT WE CAN FIND EVERY COMMITTEE COLLEGE EVERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT ADEQUATELY. IT'S A NO BRAINER I MEAN NO CATEGORY BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED THAT THIS YEAR HEY. HEY HEY THE CLAREMONT. WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT AGAIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN DO THE WORK SERVE THE STUDENTS AND MOVE THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY FORWARD. THANK YOU. OKAY I DON'T DISAGREE AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE HEAR FROM OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE- LOBBY GAME IS THAT RIGHT AS YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU GUYS ARE ON MESSAGE YOUR HUNDRED PLUS DISTRICTS IN CONTACT ALL OF US AND SAY THE SAME THING AND FOCUSING ON THAT. INADEQUATE COLAS IS IT IS A THING WE HEAR- THE MOST AND SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION LOOK WHAT. HAVE SO FAR AS PROP NINETY EIGHT REVENUES AFTER. WE GET THE MARY VICE. REVENUE PROJECTIONS. SO HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN ISSUE NUMBER THREE PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH INSURANCE PROPOSAL. DAN OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- IN THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE FOR AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE HE COMMITTED TO CONSIDERING OPTIONS TO BETTER SUPPORT PART TIME FACULTY WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO BUILD A COMMITMENT WITH THE INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND INTO THE PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS THAT THIS INVESTMENT WILL PROVIDE A STRONG FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS AUTHOR HEALTH INSURANCE TO MORE OF THEIR PART TIME FACULTY WHILE STILL PROVIDING LOCAL CONTROL AND FLEXIBILITY ON OF MEDITATION- WITHOUT HAVING AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THIS ABOUT. THANK YOU ELENA SO IS YOUR JANET NOTES IN HIS MOST AT HANOVER JUST MENTION THE GOVERNOR WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR PART TIME FACULTY AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES YOU PART TIME FACULTY ARE A CRITICAL PART OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE STATE HAS A REAL INTEREST IN MAKING SURE. THAT THEY'RE TAKEN CARE OF. WE DO NOTE THAT WITH THIS PURPOSE. THAT LEGISLATURE LACKS BASS OF BASIC INFORMATION TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. ON THIS PROPOSAL. THE LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY FACULTY PART TIME FACULTY ALREADY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND WHERE THEY GET THAT INSURANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE ALSO DOESN'T KNOW HOW MANY PART TIME FACULTY LACK. HEALTH CARE INSURANCE BUT DESPITE THE STATE'S REQUIREMENT THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE SO WITHOUT THIS BASIC INFORMATION IT'S REALLY NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S A PROBLEM AND HOW WIDESPREAD THAT PROBLEM MIGHT BE. THE. HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO PART TIME FACULTY BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS LIMITED INFORMATION CURRENTLY ON THE EXTENT OF THAT COVERAGE AT DISTRICT PROVIDED COVERAGE. AND THE COST THAT DISTRICTS ARE PASSED ON TO EMPLOYEES OR MAKE EMPLOYEES CHARGING WHETHER SOME PART TIME FACULTY MIGHT IN FACT HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF GETTING THEIR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA WHICH PROVIDES SUBSIDIES FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS. THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH TO PROVIDING HEALTH CARE TO PART TIME FACULTY THROUGH DISTRICT SPONSORED PLANS- SHOULD ALSO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- GIVEN THAT PART TIME FACULTY ARE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES AND I MENTIONED THAT IN THE PREVIOUS ISSUE THEY'RE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY M. DISTRICT EMPLOYEES. THEY MAY NOT BE RETAIN FROM ONE SEMESTER TO THE NEXT FOR ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT AND SO EVEN IF A DISTRICT THEIR DISTRICT WERE TO OFFER ROBUST COVERAGE TO PART TIME FACULTY THE LEGISLATURE FACES THE POLICY QUESTION. OF WHETHER. THIS KEEPS COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM REALLY IS THE BEST WAY TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. GIVEN THAT YOU COULD HAVE PART TIME FACULTY WORKING FOR A DISTRICT BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO TEACH CLASSES THERE ON HEALTHCARE AND THEN THEY'RE TOLD THEY'RE NOT NEEDED FOR THE NEXT SEMESTER THE NEXT YEAR AND THEY MIGHT BE OFF THE INSURANCE AT THAT POINT THAT COULD BE VERY DISRUPTIVE AND UNSTABLE. FOUR THESE IN TE EMPLOYEES USE TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND OF COURSE THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT ABOUT PART TIME FACULTY PART TIME EMPLOYEES RATHER WORKING- IN OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL AGENCIES. SO WE RECOMMEND- THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT ADMINISTRATION TO GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE INSURED STATUS A PART TIME FACULTY. AND ON PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH CARE PLANS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OFFERED BY DISTRICTS THE LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO WORK WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES TOGETHER SIMILAR INFORMATION ON PART TIME EMPLOYEES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THE LEGISLATURE COULD GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION UNTIL MAYBE THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO SUBMIT THIS INFORMATION AND THEN ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE COULD USE THAT INFORMATION. TO REALLY HELP BUILD- THE TO GATHER INFORMATION USE IT TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF TO INFORM POTENTIAL BUDGET DECISIONS FOR NEXT BUDGET YEAR ONCE THIS INFORMATION REALLY IS SOLID AND WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU CAN ANY COLLEGES GOOD MORNING AGAIN. WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE A ROBUST INVESTMENT IN PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH AT FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND WE'VE LONG BEEN UNDER INVESTING IN HEALTH FOR A PART TIME FACULTY WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE I BELIEVE THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS LONG OVERDUE. FOLLOWING EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH DISTRICTS IN FACULTY PARTNERS WE DO BELIEVE THAT AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROGRAM OVERALL IS A WARRANTED- ONE THAT WOULD PROVIDE ON A GREATER- HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT RATIO CURRENTLY DISTRICTS CAN ONLY BE REIMBURSED 50% FOR THEIR EXPENDITURES AND PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH THIS LIMITS THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH PROGRAMS OR LIMITS THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFERING QUALITY PROGRAMS. THIS SPECIFICALLY HE WE WOULD REQUEST THAT THE PROGRAM- I CONSIDERATION OF ALLOWING A 100% REIMBURSEMENT FOR QUALITY HEALTHCARE- PLANS PROVIDED TO PART TIME FACULTY DISTRICTS DISTRICTS WOULD ALSO CONSIDER- MAKING ELIGIBLE REIMBURSEMENTS AND HELP STATEMENT STATEMENTS FOR THE PART TIME FACULTY WHO DEMONSTRATE PARTICIPATION IN COVERED CALIFORNIA INSTEAD OF THE DISTRICT PLAN BUT OVERALL WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND BELIEVE THIS IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU HAVE AN ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. SO HOW WILL THIS WORK WITH TWO HUNDRED MILLION STATEWIDE IN YOUR- DISTRICTS IN ITS- GRANT PROGRAM FIRST COME FIRST SERVE HOW YOU HAVE YOUR DIFFERENT COLLEGES PARTICIPATED CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM WORKS FOR THE COLLEGES WILL APPLY FOR REIMBURSEMENT- AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE THIRTY THREE DISTRICTS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING- AND THEY SUBMIT EVIDENCE OF HOW MANY INDIVIDUAL THEY PROVIDED- HEALTH. PLANS TO OF THE COST AND THEN WE HAVE REIMBURSE THEM- FOR A 50% OF THOSE- AND DIVIDE OUT RIGHT NOW WE ONLY HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE PROGRAM SO THEY'RE GETTING A CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR THEIR REIMBURSEMENT- THIS WOULD ALLOW- MORE TO PARTICIPATE. AS THEY WOULD SEE AN INCENTIVE AND ACTUALLY AND JOINING AND BEING PART OF THE PROGRAM. SO PAID US A PICTURE OF A HYPOTHETICAL OF HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT A PART TIME. MANY COLLEGE FACULTY MEMBER IN THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE OF LOOK WHAT THEY HAVE NOW WHERE THEY PAY WHAT THEY GET AND WITH THIS POTENTIALLY. WELL WHAT HAPPENED WITH THEM. CURRENTLY NOT ALL DISTRICTS OFFERED THE PROGRAMS AND SOME THAT DO OFFER HEALTH- A REIMBURSEMENT. DON'T PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET ENOUGH BACK BUT THOSE THAT DO- WILL OFFER UP TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT- IN COVERAGE. OF FOR THEIR WORK- AND- THAT COULD INCLUDE A HEALTH OR DENTAL- AND THEN THE EMPLOYEE PAYS A PORTION THE DISTRICT PAYS ANOTHER PORTION. ARE AND OF WHAT THIS COULD DO- IS CREATE. INCENTIVES FOR BETTER QUALITY HEALTH OF PROGRAMS FOR A PART TIME FACULTY. AND THEN MORE DISTRICTS TO PARTICIPATE FOR US TO ALSO HAVE MORE ROBUST DATA ON HOW MANY ARE PARTICIPATING IN HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING SERVED WHAT KINDS OF. PLANS THEY'RE OFFERING- WHAT KIND OF COVERAGE- AND A VARIETY OF OTHER KEY METRICS MMHM. SO AS IT IT TALKS ON ABOUT HALF OF THE DISTRICTS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE THE DISTRICTS THAT DON'T CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE FOR THE ONES THAT DO AND HELP THEM EXPAND THEIR- PROGRAMS. WE WOULD FOCUS ON BOTH WITH THE FIRST FOCUSING ON THOSE THAT AREN'T PARTICIPATING BUT ALSO THOSE THAT DO PARTICIPATE SO THAT- MORE FACULTY ARE OFFERED THIS ACROSS THE STATE HOME BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO US THERE ARE OVER THIRTY ONE ON FILE THIRTY ONE HUNDRED. FACULTY THAT HAVE ACCESS TO IT'S NOT A LOT- THAT WE KNOW BUT THIS AGAIN COULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR MORE TO OFFER THE PROGRAM AND MORE TO MORE FACULTY TO HAVE PART TIME FACULTY TO HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE. OKAY MISTER O'DONNELL. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO DO WE KNOW HOW MANY PART TIME FACULTY THERE ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. WE I DON'T RECALL OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU WRONG NUMBER BUT GIVE ME. JUST A SECOND OKAY GIVE ME THAT NUMBER BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO KNOW. BUT HOW THE NUMBER GOES INTO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT. DO SOME MATH HERE- I GOT A SUMMER PARTICIPATING NOW BUT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THIS TO THIS TOUR IS A LOT OF MONEY ONGOING RIGHT TO UNDER MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING RIGHT- IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE WE DO IT WE SEEM TO DO EVERYTHING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO NOT HIRE PEOPLE FULL TIME. SO NOW WE'RE GONNA GET BENEFITS FOR WORKING PART TIME WHY NOT JUST HIRE THEM FULL TIME. IT'S JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE WE JUST. IN OUR LIVES IN THEIR OWN HOUSE LOOKING FOR THE CORNER AND THE CORNERS REALLY HIRING PEOPLE FULL TIME IT'S A NO BRAINER TO ME WANTED TO HIRE THEM FULL TIME GIVEN THE BENEFITS THAT THEY DESERVE. AS A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE- SO AGAIN I I'M I'M STILL STRUGGLING WITH THIS TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CONCEPT BECAUSE IT'S A PATCH NOT A FIX. THANK YOU. I CANNOT THANK YOU L. A. L. JUST TO RESPOND TO MR O'DONNELL- IT'S ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PART TIME FACULTY OKAY CURRENTLY IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND- WHAT'S ON OUR TO SUMMER WORKING JUST. ONE CLASS SUMMER OFFERING YOU TWO OR THREE CLASSES- BUT JUST TO THE POINT WHERE MAKING EARLIER IT'S JUST NOT KNOWN RIGHT NOW HOW MANY OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE RIGHT WHERE THEY GET IT FROM HOW MANY DON'T. RIGHT THERE'S A LOT LOGISTICS HERE TO IF I COULD MISTER JR THERE'S A LOT OF LOGISTICS HERE TO FIGURE OUT WE SOME MIGHT BE FULL TIME SOMEWHERE ELSE. RIGHT WATER EITHER TEACHING OR NOT TEACHING THEY MIGHT COMMITTEE EACH ONE CLASS BECAUSE THEY JUST WANT TO TEACH ONE CLASS. I DON'T WANT THE HEALTH INSURANCE THAT'S RIGHT A LOT ARE THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE HEARD ANECDOTALLY TALKING WITH DISTRICTS- AND THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS YOU KNOW START IS LOOKING INTO THIS AND- TRYING TO DO SOME SURVEYS. ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT THE NUMBER OF THAT PART TIME FACULTY TO GET THEIR HEALTHCARE ALREADY FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE LOOKS LIKE IT'S A FAIRLY LARGE PERCENTAGE BUT AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. THE LEGISLATURE RELAX INSTEAD OF STANDING HELP WHAT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HOW WIDESPREAD IS IT BUT I JUST. IF THE FREEWAY FLYER THING WE'VE GOT GOING ON ACROSS THE STATE SOME OF OUR PART TIMERS ARE NOT FREQUENT FLYERS RIGHT THEY JUST TEACH ONE OR TWO CLASSES BECAUSE- THAT'S ALL THEY WANT TO TEACH. NOW OTHERS. OUR TEACHING TWENTY UNITS BECAUSE EGYPT. COLLEGES RIGHT BOUNCING AROUND EVERY DAY. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE FIGURE THIS OUT LOGISTICALLY OTHER THAN HIRE PEOPLE FULL TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE PART TIME AS A ADAM FACULTY FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AT THE PORCELAIN COLLEGES TO TEACH KOREAN LANGUAGE- IT WAS OKAY BECAUSE THERE WAS ONLY ONE ONE ONE CLASS- IF WHAT. BERMAN I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE OF QUESTION IS THAT THE- IF- COMMENDATORY JEWS ARE HIRING PART TIME AT JIM FACTORS T. IS UP. TO SAVE- UP MONEY FOR PAYING BENEFITS BY HIRING FOR TIME YEAH- IF THIS OF COURSE IS A ONE IN ONE LIMITED TOWARDS- THAT'S OKAY BUT- IF- FOR EXAMPLE IF I THAT WAS SAID IN SPANISH CLASS OF WHICH WAS- MORE POPULAR AND THE MANY COURSES ARE BEING OFFERED THAN ONE INSTRUCTOR CAN TEACH SEVERAL COURSES AND A QUALIFIED ENOUGH UP FOR TIME STAGGERS. BUT THE I WONDER IF IN THAT SITUATION HAPPEN IS- YOU YOU PROVIDE THE FOUR TIME OPPORTUNITY FOR MOST QUALIFIED TO ALMOST A SENIOR PERSON TO TAKE CARE OF ALL ONE TWO THREE ALL COURSES- I THINK THAT THAT IS SO REALLY DESIRABLE- SO THAT THAT DEDICATED PERSON CAN DEVELOP. THAT THE PROGRAM IN THAT THE DEPARTMENT- AND EXPAND THE WHOLE FREELY- RATHER THAN HIRING. THREE DIFFERENT UP PART TIME PEOPLE. FOR IN THE SAME DISAPPROVE I THINK THAT IS ALL SO I THINK OF THE US OF WHAT. WE HAVE THE QUESTION THAT THE TIME. DO YOU WANT A RESPONSE THAT TECH. YEAH OKAY. WELL. I THINK IF YOU TALK TO COLLEGES WILL SAY THERE'S SOME. REASONS WHY THEY- LIKE TO HAVE PART TIME FACULTY IT'S SEPARATE FROM SAVING MONEY THEY LIKE THE FLEXIBILITY HAVING A PART TIME FACULTY THEY'RE NOT SURE IF THE HOW MANY COURSES ARE GOING TO NEED OR HOW LONG THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THAT PROGRAM SO THEY DON'T NEED TO HAVE- TENURE AND YOU FIND A SPOT FOR THAT- FACULTY FOR THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS ALSO YOU CAN GET A GET EXPERTISE YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMEBODY IN THE COMMUNITY WHO IS AN EXPERT IN A CERTAIN AREA. YU CAN BRING THEM ON MAYBE THEY DON'T WANT A FULL TIME JOB AT THE COLLEGE BUT THEY'RE WILLING TO HELP AND TEACH- BUT YOU'RE AT THE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THERE ARE. REASONS WHY YOU WANT. FULL TIME FACULTY YOU NEED THE FULL THE FULL TIME FACULTY FOR THAT STABILITY TO BUILD THE PROGRAM MAINTAIN THE PROGRAM. WORK ON A SERVICE TO THE COLLEGE. AND HI ANYONE HIRING DEVELOP THE CURRICULUM DEVELOP THOSE PARTNERSHIPS. WITH INDUSTRY. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING COLLEGES- PRODUCT STRUGGLE WITH IS HOW MANY PART TIMERS VERSUS HOW MANY FULL TIMERS JUSTO HARKEN BACK TO THE EARLIER ISSUE WE HAD RECOMMENDED INCREASING BASE FUNDING FOR THE COLLEGES AND ONE ONE OF THE- ADVANTAGES OF THAT COULD BE YOU MORE MONEY TO THE COLLEGES COULD HELP THEM THE POTENTIALLY HIRE MORE FULL TIME FACULTY AND HAVE MORE FULL TIME FACULTY IF THAT'S IN FACT WHAT. WHAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST WAY TO MOVE THERE- PROGRAMS FORWARD AND KEEP THOSE PROGRAMS REVISED. THE STRONGLY- RECOMMEND US AND WHEN. SURE ENOUGH FORCESOUT ONE PART TIME- PERSON READY AND WILLING AND QUALIFIED INSTRUCTORS- TO WORK ITSELF FOR THE TIME CAN TAKE CARE OF ALL THAT THAT POLICIES SO I THINK THAT THAT IS A MORE DESIRABLE- BECAUSE THAT THAT PERSON MAY PACKED AND THE VISIT THREE OF THE FOUR DIFFERENT ENOUGH BUT THE BUT THE COLLEGES ON CAMPUS IS- IS- INSTRUCT ON THE FREEWAY HE IN ALL KIND OF THINGS. SO- AT IS SO CORD BY THE- WEATHER. THE CAMPER. IS A- WE'RE TRYING. TO- IMPLEMENT THAT KIND OF UP FOR TIME JOB THAT THE PROGRAM IS THERE ANY- THE CENTRALIZED- WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE CAN SUPERVISE TWO OR OR STUDY WHY DO WE HAVE A SO MANY YOU KNOW AT CHEN- FACULTY MEMBERS AND- I DON'T KNOW AT THIS TIME WITH THOSE AT THE ANY MONITORING SYSTEM. TO EVALUATE THE- IN THE SAME DISCIPLINE TOO MANY ADS IN FACT WAS DISAPPOINTING WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN. A CONSOLIDATED IN CONSOLIDATED INTO A FULL TIME POSITION. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I DON'T I DON'T KNOW OKAY WE KNOW IT CREDITORS LOOKING TO A YOU KNOW FULL TIME PART TIME FACULTY THAT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A- YOUR REQUIREMENT I THE STATE. ON HUNDRED PART TIME FULL TIME RATIONS. OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OFTEN NEXT ISSUE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE CAPITAL OUTLAY. AGAIN DEVIN OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND FUNDING OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION ONE TIME FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF SEVENTEEN PROJECTS ANTICIPATED TO COMPLETE DESIGN BY SPRING TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND THE WORKING DRAWING PHASE OF ONE PROJECT. THIS ALLOCATION REPRESENTS THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF THE TWO BILLION AVAILABLE TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGES UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT DEFERED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS AT THE CAMPUSES. THIS FUNDING WILL BUILD ON THE FIVE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN MILLION INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT TO FURTHER ADDRESS THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU L. L. THANK YOU WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE GOT A WITH THE- CAPITAL OUTLAY- PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN YOUR AGENDA THESE ARE ALL CONTINUING PROJECTS AND SEEM TO BE. ON TIME AND ON BUDGET- IN ADDITION- AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES WE ARE ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG FOR THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY GO DOWN AS A RESULT OF THE LEGISLATURE'S FUNDING IN THE IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET SO THE BACKLOG WAS IDENTIFIED ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION IT'S NOW ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AGAIN AS A RESULT OF A LOT OF THE FUNDING GOING TO FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. SO DEFERRED SPENDING ONE TIME MONEY ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD USE OF ONE TIME MONEY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE STRIVE TO PROVIDE AT LEAST AS MUCH AS WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING IN JANUARY. IF THE PROPOSITION- NINETY PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS HIGHER MAY REVISE WHICH IS LIKELY- THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING EVEN MORE FUNDING THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED IN JANUARY WE ALSO THE ENCOURAGE A LEGISLATURE DEVELOP TO DEVELOP A LONG TERM STRATEGY FOR NOT JUST PAIN. THE BACKLOG BUT ALSO KEEPING IT FROM CREEPING BACK UP- AS BUILDING SYSTEMS COME DUE AND SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ON DEVELOPING A MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG AND ADDRESSING MAINTENANCE AS IT COMES DUE AND FUNDING IT AS IT COMES DUE SO THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH IT ANOTHER BIG DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG IN SEVERAL YEARS FROM NOW. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU HER CAN COLLEGE. GOOD MORNING AGAIN WAS THAT EVER WITH THIS CANCERS OFFICE- THANKS TO A ROBUST TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO INVESTMENT FOR MAINTENANCE. AND AS WAS MENTIONED THE BACKLOG HAS BEEN REDUCED TO ONE POINT TWO BILLION. STATE FUNDING HAS PREVENTED THE BACKLOG FROM GROWING THE EXTERNAL PRESSURES SUCH AS INCREASED COST OF CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES. AND LABOR HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT- FOR THE BACKLOG TO BE. ELIMINATED COMPLETELY THAT WE MAKE IMPORTANT STRIDES. THEREFORE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF THAT CAN COMMITTEE COLLEGES. CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD FULL ELIMINATION OF THAT BACKLOG ENSURING QUALITY AND SAFE FACILITIES FOR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF. WITH REGARD TO CAPITAL OUTLAY THE TEAMSTERS OFFICE- LEADS- A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF FACILITIES PROPOSALS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND RECOGNITION OF CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND POPULATION TRENDS. THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS APPROVED CHANGES TO THE SCORING METHODOLOGY AND WE'RE EMPHASIZING MODERNIZATION OVER GROWTH. AND CONSTRUCTION OF NEW BUILDINGS THIS RESPONSIBLE APPROACH ENSURES THAT COLLEGES ARE MAXIMIZING THE RESOURCES- THEY'RE USING- WHILE- USING THEIR PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT EFFECTIVELY. THE PROJECT BEFORE YOU HAVE BEEN ESCORTED TO THIS RUBRIC ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE ENTERING OUR FINAL ROUND OF PROP FIFTY ONE BOND FUNDING AN ABSENT RESOURCES FUTURE PROJECTS WILL NOT HAVE A DEDICATED. A SOURCE. THANK YOU HAVE BEEN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU- SLEAZE THIS IS THE I THINK FINANCIALLY AS A THIS IS THE LAST PHASE OF THAT PRIOR BOND FUNDS VERY- YES. PLEASE YEAH. SYSTEM THAT WE DON'T HAVE A NEW BONDS OR IN A FUSION OF MONEY- ONE TIME MONEY FOR CAPITAL NEEDS. INCLUDED EXTINCT EXTINGUISHED RESOURCES TO ADDRESS. COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAPITAL PROJECTS RIGHT HERE AT THE TIME. OKAY. FOLLOWING IS A REMINDER FOR US AS WELL. AND THEN WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF COURSE IS ALWAYS A BALLOT CIRCLES SO CERTAINLY SEE HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAVE AFTER THAT. THEY REALIZE IS COMPLETE. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER FIVE STUDENTS SUPPORT. PROPOSALS. DAN HAD OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- TO BEGIN THIS PANEL I ONE OF THREE PROPOSES THAT UTILIZE ONE TIME RESOURCES TO SIMPLIFY THE COLLEGE GOING AND TRANSFER PRODUCTS VARIANTS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT COMMON COURSE NUMBER AND- THIS INVESTMENT IS RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB ELEVEN ELEVEN. AND BUILDS UPON THE INVESTMENT OF TEN MILLION INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON COURSE NUMBING SYSTEM ACROSS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES SIXTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND. FOR COLLEGES TO IMPLEMENT THE TRANSFER FOR PROVISIONS OF EIGHTY NINE TWENTY EIGHT. THIRD THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO ASSIST COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BUT THE PROCUREMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SOFTWARE THAT CLEARLY MAPS OUT ALL INTER SEGMENTAL BURKE NOT TO INTERCEPT OF CURRICULAR PATHWAYS. TO HELP STUDENTS CHOOSE THEIR PATHWAY THE SAUTEED TRANSFERRED TO IN THE SEGMENTS AND REDUCE ACCESS UNITS TAKEN ON ABOUT THE DEGREE PROGRAM OR PROGRAM COMPLETION. THESE PROPOSALS WILL BUILD UPON ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE COLLEGES TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMER. THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THE PANDEMIC AND ENSUING RECESSION HAVE NOT IMPACTED ALL GROUPS EQUALLY. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC PERSISTENT LONG TERM EQUITY GAPS HAVE EXISTED OF MOST IF NOT ALL OF OUR STATES COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS SUCH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A SLATE OF NEW INVESTMENTS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND WORK TOWARDS MEETING THE MULTI YEAR ROADMAP GOAL OF ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. IN PARTICULAR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION ON GOING TO SUPPORT THE NEXT UP PROGRAM TEN MILLION ON GOING TO SUPPORT THE SUSTAINABLE IMPLEMENTATION OF- YOU COMPLIMENT OPPORTUNITY BEST PRACTICES. TO DIVERSIFY COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS. TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME SUPPORT EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS TO ELIGIBLE AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS. ONE POINT ONE MILLION ON GOING TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF- AMEND STUDENT CHARTERS TO AN INCREASED NUMBER OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. AND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND ONE TIME TO SUPPORT. A STUDY OF THE U. MOSHE PROGRAMS- PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE STUDENT SUCCESS FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS TO PROGRAMS THAT ARE STATUTORILY OR TYPICALLY RECEIVE ONE. OF HAVE ANY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THESE ABOUT. OKAY THANK YOU. SO THEIR NUMBER OF PROPOSALS- IN ISSUE FIVE THOSE ARE ON PAGES TWENTY EIGHT AND TWENTY NINE OF YOUR AGENDA WE GENERALLY DON'T HAVE A CONCERN. WITH THE- WITH MANY OF THOSE PROPOSALS I JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS- FIRST THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE MUCH INFORMATION ON THE AMEND. A PROPOSAL OR A TWO MAN IS BOTTOM OF PAGE TWENTY EIGHT AMEND PROPOSAL- THIS WOULD BE A NEWLY FUNDED- STATE PROGRAM- SO THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO JUST GET SOME BASIC INFORMATION TO DATE THAT THE INFORMATION. PROVIDED IS BEEN PRETTY LIMITED US LEGISLATURE GET GET INFORMATION ON WHAT IS ALLOWABLE USES OF THIS FINDING OUT HOW WITH THE PROPOSED AMOUNT HOW WAS THE PROPOSED AMOUNT THE ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON DETERMINED HOW THE FUNDS BE ALLOCATED- HOW WOULD THE PROGRAM MEASURE SUCCESS. ALSO HOW WOULD THE PROGRAM INTERACT WITH ANOTHER STATE FUNDED PROGRAM FOCUSED ON AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AND THAT'S- A THE- MOTOR PROGRAM. SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO DIRECT ADMINISTRATION AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AND THEN USE IT TO MAKE A DECISION IN THE FINAL BUDGET- AS WE UNDERSTAND IT- THE PROGRAM PATHWAYS MAPPING TECHNOLOGY TO MISTER HANOVER MENTIONED THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME PROPOSED. THAT WOULD BE A USER FRIENDLY WAY FOR STUDENTS TO SEE WHAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSES STUDENTS SHOULD TAKE AND WHAT WATER TO GET A CERTIFICATE OR DEGREE. NO SUCH TECHNOLOGY MIGHT HAVE MERIT BUT WE DO NOTE THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL SOON BE CHANGING THEIR COLLEGE SPECIFIC COURSE NUMBERS THE COURSE NAME AND NUMBERS BUT THEY HAVE NOW THERE'S LEGISLATION. THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED TO MOVE TO A COMMON COURSE NUMBER IN SYSTEM FOR ALL THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THE COLLEGES HAVE TO INCORPORATE THE NEW COURSE NAME AND NUMBERS THIS COMMON NORM NUMBER IN SYSTEM. INTO THEIR COURSE CATALOGS BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR NOW THE WORK HASN'T EVEN REALLY BEGUN YET ON THAT- BUT THEY HAVE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO GET THESE OF COURSE NUMBERS IN THE CATALOG. SO GIVEN THIS PRETTY MAJOR UNDERTAKING THAT THE COLLEGES ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON OF IT WE THINK IT MIGHT BE PREMATURE TO CREATE THIS PROGRM MAPPING TOOL AND ROLL IT OUT USING- THE FUNDING AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THIS OR OTHER PROPOSALS THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. CAN WE CAN COLLEGES. GOOD MORNING AGAIN WAS THAT NEVER WITH THE K. PUMP COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH THE GO FOR PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN SEVERAL PROGRAMS THAT DIRECTLY FOCUS ON STUDENT SUPPORTS MANY OF WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED FOR THE FOR SIDE OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE INTEREST AND OF TIME- GIVE FOCUS MY REMARKS ON THREE PROPOSALS THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE AGENDA- AS OF INTEREST FOR GETTING MORE INFORMATION THE FIRST IS- THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE EDUCATION NETWORK DEVELOPMENT KNOWN AS A MAN- WHICH PROVIDES SUPPORT GUIDANCE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AMANDA IS PART OF CRITICAL WORK AND URGENT EFFORTS TO SUPPORT BLACK STUDENT SUCCESS- THIS PROPOSAL IS MODEST AND WOULD FOCUS ON STUDENT CHARTERS OTHER MEN AND- IN SUPPORTING A STUDENT SUPPORT STRUCTURE THAT ESTABLISHES AFFIRMING ENVIRONMENTS- WHERE AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE STUDENTS AND MEN OF COLOR ARE ABLE TO THRIVE THE AIM OF A MANNED- STUDENT CHARTERS IS TO APPROVE IMPROVE ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND TO DEVELOP CULTURALLY COMPETENT STUDENT LEADERS THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWENTY FOUR AMEND STERN CHARTERS THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIRTY ADDITIONAL ONES. A SO THAT THERE. IS A BROADER REACH ACROSS THE STATE. SECOND I WANTED BRIEFLY FOCUS ON FINANCIAL AID OFFICES- FINANCIAL AID OFFICES HAVE BEEN MORE CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL THAN EVER THESE OFFICES HAVE WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK TO PROVIDE BILLIONS IN EMERGENCY GRANTS. TO SUPPORT A HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR CAL GRANT AND TO SUPPORT CALFRESH ENROLLMENT. HOWEVER FINANCIAL AID OFFICES- WORKLOAD HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IT'S ONE OF THE FEW PROGRAMS THAT IS ACTUALLY SEEN A REDUCTION IN STATE FUNDING. THIS IS BECAUSE FINANCIAL AID OFFICES HAVE A FORMULA THAT IS BASED ON ENROLLMENT- AND GIVEN THE IMPORTANT ROLE FINANCIAL AID OFFICES PLAYED MEETING STUDENT INCREASE IS WARRANTED AN ESSENTIAL. LASTLY I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- EFFORTS AROUND EMERGENCY GRANTS- AS WELL AND I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND- THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. DISTRICTS RECEIVED OVER FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION IN ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDING AVAILABLE- FOR DIRECT STUDENT AID BUT ALSO FOR- INSTITUTIONAL ABRASIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. THIS IS MANTA THAT- THESE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN PACKAGED IN COMBINATION WITH STATE INVESTMENTS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH EMERGENCY GRANTS RANGING FROM SIX HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS. PROVIDING THEM WITH LAPTOPS HOT SPOTS AND OTHER SUPPORT AND BASIC NEEDS INCLUDING HOUSING. AND SO THESE OF ALL- BEEN- REALLY VALUABLE AND MUCH NEEDED BOTH IN SUPPORTING STUDENTS BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT WE CAN RE ENROLL STUDENTS THAT HAD TO STOP OUT. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. OKAY. SUFFER THE INCREASES IN LAST YEAR'S PROMO JAB MESA AND QUENTE COMMUNICATORS IS TO HAVE ANY RAPE REPORT BACK ON. AND- IMPLEMENTATION NOW THAT'S BEEN HOW THAT'S BEEN GOING. AT THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU SITE RECEIVED AN INCREASE- LIST LAST YEAR THEY'RE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR- BUT I WILL- FINALIZE THE ACADEMIC YEAR AND GET MORE INFORMATION ON HOW THAT SUPPORT SOME OF IT HAS BEEN TO KEEP UP WITH THE COST OF OPERATION BUT ALSO TO EXPAND ACCESS- PARTICULARLY ON TO STUDENTS THAT HARPER FROM UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUNDS BUT- HAPPY TO SHARE AN UPDATE AS WE LEARN MORE AND GET ADDITIONAL DATA. YEAH AND- YEAH THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEES VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IN RATES AMONG CERTAIN COMMITTEES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN NOTED AND WARRANTS INVESTMENT. THE OTHER ONE THAT WE HAVEN'T GROUP THAT WE HAD FOCUSED ON OBVIOUS A SMALL GROUP IN CALIFORNIA BUT NOT A LOT OF TREMENDOUS ACADEMIC SUCCESS ALWAYS IS NATIVE AMERICANS AND SO THERE'S A THERE'S THEIR- REQUEST. BY FEW ENTITIES TO SERVE TO SUPPORT IT'S CALLED THE NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAM. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT. NOT AT THIS TIME OKAY HAPPY TO LEARN MORE YEAH I THINK IT'S SIMILAR TO A MOSHE IN THAT EMOJI WAS A PROGRAM WHICH WAS NEVER FUNDED THROUGH THE STATE THROUGH. THEY CANCERS OFFICE UNTIL I THINK THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THIS COMMITTEE PUT AT THE STATE- NINE ITEM IN THERE. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE INTRIGUED ABOUT TEN WHEN I. SEE IF WE CAN HELP STUDENTS WHO HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND- SO IF YOU CAN WORK WITH US AND GET BACK TO US ON THAT- I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THESE ITEMS ARE ALL PROGRAMS WITH THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FOR WE WILL. YOU KNOW TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO THAT. FURTHER- SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS WHEN WE FINALIZE OUR BUDGET AFTER ME- NEXT ISSUE ISSUE NUMBER SIX IS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE POSITIONS NINETEEN POSITIONS TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION IN ADDITIONAL ONGOING SUPPORT. BINANCE. GOOD MORNING CHECK A CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER TALKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES INCREASE OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT NINE NEW POSITIONS AT THE CCC CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT TEN ADDITIONAL NEW POSITIONS IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. THESE NEW RICK- TO SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THE CCC MULTI YEAR ROADMAP THESE NEW RESOURCES WILL AID THE CCC CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND SUPPORTING CURRICULA CURRICULUM RELATED REFORMS TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION EFFORTS AND INCREASE STATE OPERATIONS CAPACITY FOR DATA ANALYSIS RESEARCH LEGAL AFFAIRS DISTRICTS HEALTH MONITORING AND GOVERNMENT RELATIONS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU ELENA. THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN MCCARTY YOU YOU MENTIONED AT THE OUTSET OF THE HEARING ABOUT. ALL THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MONEY COMING TO THE COLLEGES OF THE LAST LAST FEW YEARS AND NEW PROGRAMS CREATED. IN THE STATE IS GIVEN THE CHANCE WAS OFFICE MORE MORE RESPONSIBILITY- ON ADMINISTERING THESE PROGRAMS OF- THAT FOR THE MOST PART IS NOT BEEN- IS NOT GIVEN POSITIONS TO THE TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND YOU CAN SEE ACTUALLY ON PAGE THIRTY SIX UNDERSTAFFED COMMENT THE JUST A- A LIST OF SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. THESE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SO WE DO SEE MERIT- TO PROVIDING- OR WERE OPEN TO THE IDEA OF PROVIDING MORE POSITIONS TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- YOU CAN SEE OUR RECORD RECOMMENDATIONS ON PAGES THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE OF THE AGENDA. YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S ACTUAL PROPOSALS TO US IS KIND OF A MIXED BAG WE DO SEE JUSTIFICATION FOR SOME OF THESE POSITIONS BUT IN OTHER CASES- THE POSITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY JUSTIFIED. AT THIS TIME. AS WE READ- APPROVING- TWO POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT- TRANSFER REFORMS THIS ASSEMBLY BILL NINE TWENTY EIGHT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN BILL THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IN THE FALL. IT MAKES SENSE TO US TO APPROVE THOSE POSITIONS BUT TO MAKE A LIMITED TERM SINCE THE WORK THEY WOULD BE DOING WOULD JUST BE THROUGH TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE SEVEN. NO REASON AT THIS TIME TO MAKE THOSE PERMANENT POSITIONS AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES WE ALSO RECOMMEND APPROVING. TO OTHER POSITIONS- THAT WOULD WORK ON BASIC NEEDS RISING SCHOLARS PROGRAM A NUMBER OF OTHER PROGRAMS OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED. BUT WE RECOMMEND. MOVING UP FUNDING FOR THOSE POSITIONS TO TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THE GOVERNOR HAS THOSE POSITIONS FUNDED IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR BUT THE PROGRAMS ARE STARTING UP NOW AND SO WE THINK THE CHANCES OFFICE. WOULD BENEFIT FROM GETTING. POSITION AUTHORIZATION FOR THOSE- POSITIONS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. WE ALSO- WE RIVER WE REJECT A COUPLE POSITIONS WE RECOMMEND A LEGISLATURE REJECT A COUPLE POSITIONS SAY- SPECIALIST POSITION A PROGRAM ASSISTANT. A POSITION THEY WOULD BE WORKING ON ETHNIC STUDIES AND A COMPETENCY BASED. EDUCATION CURRICULUM. WE THINK THAT THIS SUDDEN BURKE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BUT THE INFORMATION WE GOT FROM THE CHANCES OFFICES THAT ALREADY. TWO POSITIONS TO SPECIALISTS OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ARE DEDICATED TO THAT WORKLOAD. AS FOR THE OTHER THIRTEEN POSITIONS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE VERY WELL NAY NEED THOSE POSITIONS TO ADMINISTER BUT- RIGHT AS OF RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH WORKLOAD JUSTIFICATION OF BACKUP YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS RECEIVED. FROM OF THE ADMINISTRATION ON THOSE POSITIONS SO WE RECOMMEND GIVING ADMINISTRATION SO MORE TIME UNTIL MAY REVISED PERHAPS TO. DEVELOP WORKLOAD JUSTIFICATION WHAT EXACTLY THESE POSITIONS WOULD BE DOING WHY THEY'RE NEEDED WHY THE CURRENT. POSITIONS THAT ARE AUTHORIZED ARE INSUFFICIENT AND THEN LEGISLATURE CAN USE THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE A DECISION ON A POSITION OF AUTHORITY FOR NEXT YEAR AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR PERHAPS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU AT CANCERS OFFICE AND GOOD AFTERNOON OR MORNING AGAIN- OF SPECIFIC IMPORTANCE TO CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERIES THE ABILITY FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO ADVANCE. AT EDUCATIONAL REFORMS AND WORKFORCE PATHWAYS THAT HELP CALIFORNIANS RECOVER AND THRIVE. CURRENTLY THE CHANCES OFFICES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT MAJOR STATEWIDE PRIORITIES AND RECENTLY ENACTED POLICIES MANY OF WHICH OF THIS BODY PRIORITISES AND CHAMPIONS. TODAY THE CANCERS OFFICE ADMINISTERS OVER A HUNDRED AND FIVE PROGRAMS COMPARED TO THIRTY ONE JUST TEN YEARS AGO WITH ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN STAFF. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE VACANCY RATE IS ALSO BELOW STATE AGENCY AVERAGES. THE PROPOSED POSITIONS FOR THE OFFICE ARE NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO BETTER SERVE OUR HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COLLEGES AND ADDRESS CORE GAP AREAS INCLUDING POLICIES AND INITIATIVES AND SOME OF THE HIGHEST PROFILE. AND CRITICAL WORK AT THAT WE UNDERTAKE AT OUR COLLEGES BOTH- IN AREAS OF GREAT DISTRICT LEVEL INVESTMENT NEED. MANY OF THESE INCLUDE RISING SCHOLARS TRANSFERABLE ARM BACCALAUREATE DEGREE IMPLEMENTATION COMMON COURSE NUMBERRING FISCAL HEALTH OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES ZERO TEXTBOOK COST AGREES STUDENT RETENTION STRATEGIES. CALFRESH FOOD SECURITY BASIC NEEDS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES EXPANSION OF DIGITAL ACCESSIBILITY DIGITAL COURSE CONTENT DEVELOPMENT DOING ROLE MEANT DATA SECURITY ONBOARDING REDESIGN ALL TO BE T. Q. I A. STUDENTS SUPPORT. JUST TO NAME A FEW ABSENT RESOURCES TO EXPAND CAPACITY THIS CRITICAL WORK AROUND IMPLEMENTATION INNOVATION AND COMPLIANCE HAS BEEN AMASSED INTO EXISTING DUTIES SO WE JUST. PILE ON TO PEOPLE'S EXISTING. EXISTING WORK. LIMITING THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TIME AND EXPERTISE AND ANALYSIS NEEDED TO MEET BOTH THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE IS INTENDED DELIVERABLES. IN ADDITION THESE POSITIONS ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY DATA THAT IS OFTEN NECESSARY FOR THE SYSTEM FOR COLLEGE LEVEL DECISION MAKING TO FOSTER INCREASED IT- TO SCALE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. TO DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF SOLUTIONS- AND TO ALSO SERVE THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU ARE EXPLORING ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS AND INVESTMENTS. SO WE ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THESE POSITIONS AND ACTUALLY CONSIDER OUR FULL PROPOSAL OF THIRTY ONE POSITIONS HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THE NEXT MONTH TO SHARE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEED AND THE GAP AREA. THANK YOU. OKAY I THINK YEAH I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- I GENERALLY SUPPORT OF THIS I KNOW WE- FOCUS ON. SEVEN GREAT EFFORTS IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND NEW PROGRAMS TO BILLS AND BUDGET EFFORTS AND- WE CAN'T JUST LOADING ON LOAD ON MORE AND MORE STUFF TO DO WITHOUT RECOGNIZING IT TAKES WORK TO GET IT DONE EFFECTIVELY SO. I WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN- AND THEN GET TO OUR LAST ISSUE BECAUSE VERY GOOD NUMBER EIGHT- CYBER SECURITY PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. RUN THROUGH THIS QUICKLY PLACE THANK YOU. TWENTY AGAIN TENER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TWO OR ONE HUNDRED MILLION- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND OF WHICH TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS ON GOING TO ADDRESS THE MODERNIZATION. OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING SENSITIVE DATA PROTECTION EFFORTS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THIS PROPOSAL MIRRORS OUR QUEST INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM REQUEST TO BETTER EQUIP COLLEGES TO PROTECT THEIR DATA AGAINST ATTACKS SIMILAR TO THOSE ATTEMPTED OVER THE PAST ECONOMIC HERE. AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA ONGOING FUNDING WOULD BE PRIMARILY UTILIZED FOR DISTRICTS TO HIRE ON CYBER SECURITY STAFF AS WELL AS ESTABLISH SYSTEM WIDE OVERSIGHT. ONE TIME FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO PROCURE SECURITY UPGRADES FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE NETWORKS AND- THE FOR THE CCC APPLY. WITHOUT HAVING ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THE INVESTMENT- THANK YOU L. A. L. pMERIT TO THE PROPOSAL- MAINTAIN INFORMATION SECURITY PREVENTING. FRAUD IS REALLY CRITICAL- IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES LAUDABLE THAT THE- GOVERNOR ADDRESSES THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE FIND MERIT- WITH PROVIDING FUNDS FOR COLLEGES THEY CAN USE TO HIRE SOME DEDICATED CYBERSECURITY STAFF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT. IN IN IN A LOT OF COLLEGES WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DEDICATED CYBERSECURITY STAFF WE DO SEE MERIT TO A STRONGER STATE LEVEL ROLE. WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- LEADING THAT EFFORT COLLECTING BETTER DATA FROM COLLEGES WHEN THERE ARE CYBER ATTACKS WERE. FRIED SUSPECTED FRAUD SO- OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MAINLY AROUND JUST THE ALLOCATION METHOD OF THE FUNDS AND THEN IN SOME CASES JUST NEEDS- NEED FOR SO SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CLARITY ABOUT HOW THE MONEY WOULD BE USED AND HOW THE AMOUNT WAS- WAS REACHED AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT ACTUALLY IS ON PAGE THIRTY NINE OF THE- AGENDA YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS- SO WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO THE COLLEGES BUT HAVING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES DEVELOPMENT ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY. SO THAT THERE'S A MINIMUM FUNDING AMOUNT FOR THE DISTRICTS AND- AND SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY IF IT'S A MULTI COLLEGE DISTRICT. ALSO WE THINK THOUGH THE CHANCES OFFICE ADMINISTRATION COULD. USE SOME TIME BETWEEN NOW AND MAY BE REVISED TO THINK THROUGH MORE ABOUT HOW THE STATE LEVEL ROLE IS GOING TO WORK YOU CAN SEE IN YOUR AGENDA OTHERS STATEWIDE CYBER SECURITY TEAMS ARE PROPOSED. THERE'S A SYSTEM LEVEL OVERSIGHT BODY THEY'RE ALSO CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE POSITIONS WHICH WERE YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE PREVIOUS ISSUE ITEM SO IT'S A PRETTY COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND JUST THINK THE LEGISLATURE. COULD USE SOME BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT HOW EXACTLY THIS WOULD WORK AND WHAT'S OF DIVISION OF LABOR. BOB WITH REGARD TO- THOSE ONE TIME FUNDS THAT MISTER HANOVER MENTIONED. THAT'S A TOTAL OF SIXTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME. TO THE COLLEGES- WE RECOMMEND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE YOU KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE GET THE CHANCES OFFICE COPE WITH AN ALLOCATION. METHODOLOGY THAT ADDRESSES NOT JUST THE- ENROLLMENT OF THE SIZE OF THE COLLEGE BUT ALSO ITS CURRENT LEVEL OF PREPAREDNESS FOR CYBER ATTACKS TO TRYING TO LIFT UP. ALL THE COLLEGES TO A MINIMUM LEVEL OF CYBER SECURITY GIVEN THAT. THE CASE NOW IS THERE ARE PRETTY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PREPAREDNESS. SO HOW MANY CHANCES OFFICE REALLY PRIORITIZE YOUR MONEY FOR THOSE THAT THAT NEED THE MOST HELP IN GETTING THEM UP TO THAT LEVEL AND ALSO AT THE LEGISLATURE DOES NEED A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT'S THE ON GOING. COST OF THIS PACKAGE IS A LOT OF ONE TIME MONEY BUT THE ONE TIME MONEY'S GOING TO BE USED FOR THINGS LIKE ANNUAL LICENSES FOR SOFTWARE. AND TRAINING AND SOME CONSULTING SERVICES THERE ARE SOME COSTS THAT. WE ACTUALLY ARE MORE INFO IN ONGOING NATURE LEGISLATURE JUST NEEDS A MUCH BETTER IDEA ABOUT WHAT THOSE ONGOING COSTS ARE. AND JUST FINALLY ON THE CCC APPLY- PROPOSALS SEEK AGAIN THAT'S ON PAGE THIRTY NINE THERE IS A ON GOING IN ONE TIME MONEY FOR THAT. CCC APPLIED AS THE- COMMON ONLINE APPLICATION PORTAL THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- HAS DEFINITELY COULD USE SOME UPDATING AND REDESIGNING AND BETTER ANTI FRAUD SECURITY SO WE'RE IN FAVOR IN SUPPORT OF FUNDING FOR THAT. BUT THE THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT SOME ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD JUSTIFICATION FOR SOME OF THE. ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. OKAY I THINK YOU'RE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HAD GOT GOOD MORNING AGAIN- OUR SYSTEM NEEDS A STRONG INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES ESPECIALLY CYBER SECURITY- THE SEVERITY OF OUR NEEDS CONTINUE TO INCREASE EVEN AS JUST LAST MONTH. ANOTHER DISTRICT EXPERIENCED A CYBER SECURITY ATTACK. MODERNIZING STATE AND DISTRICT LEVEL TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND CCC APPLY ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURE. FACULTY AND STUDENTS SENSITIVE DATA ARE PROTECTED FROM THESE ATTACKS WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT DATA CHALLENGES AND LIMITED TECHNOLOGY CAPACITY RISK. UNDERMINING A KEY REFORMS THAT ADVANCE STUDENT SUCCESS. THE PROPOSED ACKNOWLEDGING SECURITY INVESTMENTS ARE TWO FOLD RELYING ON STATE AND LOCAL ACTION. WELL SMALL PORTION WOULD BE USED FOR ONGOING SOFTWARE CARS COST. THE MAJORITY WILL SUPPORT ON GOING MODERATE- MONITORING AND IMPLEMENTATION. STATE LEVEL ACTIONS ARE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY MONITORING TAILORING SUPPORT FOR DISTRICTS- PRIOR- THOUGH NOT EXCLUSIVELY- BUT MOSTLY TARGETING ON THOSE SMALLER LESS MATURE. TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS AT CERTAIN DISTRICTS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THESE OPTIONS AND UPGRADES NOT BE DONE IN A SILO. WE MUST TACKLE GROWING TECHNOLOGY ISSUES AND RISK AND THIS IS AN ONGOING EFFORT AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES- EFFORTS BY BAD ACTORS BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. SECOND WE MUST AND IMPROVE THE STUDENT USER EXPERIENCE AND REDESIGN CCC APPLY THIS IS A COMPLEX ENDEAVOR- THAT SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE COLLECT THE DATA THAT WE NEED FROM STUDENTS BUT WE ALSO DON'T MAKE THE APPLICATION SO CUMBERSOME THAT STUDENTS AND PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS STOP MIDWAY THROUGH. SO THE EFFORT IS REALLY GOING TO BE A DELICATE AND URGENT BALANCE OF ART AND SCIENCE SO AGAIN WE THINK THESE. INVESTMENTS ARE CRITICAL AND SEEK YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU HAVE BEEN TWENTY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE WILL- I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN UNTIL AFTER THE MAY REVISION I WITH THAT WE'LL NOW PROCEED TO PUBLIC COMMENTS HERE IN PERSON PLEASE- LINED UP AT THE MICROPHONE WILL THAT PUBLIC COMMENT FOR ONE MINUTE OR LESS.

AND THAT IS THIS FOSTER AND KINSHIP CARE EDUCATION PROGRAM WE I AM FROM THE FOLSOM LAKE COLLEGE PROGRAM- WE ARE A TINY LITTLE PROGRAM BUDGET WISE WE ARE FUNDED WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO PROP NINETY EIGHT WITH A FEDERAL MATCH. YET WE HAVE A HUGE IMPACT THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WE ARE CURRENTLY FACING A ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT NEXT YEAR. A REDUCTION IN FUNDING- DUE TO THE FEDERAL CALCULATION THE WAY IT'S MATCHED- BUT OUR PROGRAM. THAT IMPACTS- FOSTER PARENTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROVIDING THE TRAINING THAT IS STATE MANDATED. IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A CARE GIVER OR IF YOU ARE ALREADY CARE GIVER THEIR MANDATE TO ATTEND ANNUAL HOURS- WE ARE THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES LOCALIZED TRAINING WE WORK CLOSELY WITH COUNTY CHILD WELFARE OFFICES. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN UNDERFUNDED FOR YEARS- AND THE FEDERAL. RATE IS DECLINING WE ARE LOSING PROGRAMS SO THAT MEANS THAT MANY PROGRAMS UP AND DOWN THE STATE JUST CAN'T FUNCTION ANYMORE AND THEN. THAT LEAVES CARE GIVERS. LESS SUPPORT LESS QUALITY LOCALIZED INFORMATION SO WE'RE ASKING YOU. TO FIND TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM AND SUSTAIN US. UP SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE QUALITY TRAINING FOR CAREGIVERS THAT ARE CARING FOR CHILDREN UP AND DOWN THE STATE THANK YOU SO MUCH.

WE'RE DOWN TO FIFTY FOUR ANTICIPATING LOSING WITH THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF FEDERAL LOSS THAT. SO ALL THE STANDARD IS SO LOW FEWER AND FEWER CHILDREN ARE QUALIFYING FEWER PEOPLE FILED CHILD ABUSE REPORTS DURING CODED.
