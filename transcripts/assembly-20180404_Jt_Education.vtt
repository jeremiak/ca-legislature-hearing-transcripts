CALIFORNIA ALREADY BEFORE HIS.

00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:29.801 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:32.037 region:rollup2
SPEAR HEADED BY THERE AM

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:34.806 region:rollup2
SPEARHEADED BY THE LOCAL CONTROL

00:29:32.037 --> 00:29:36.108 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA AND A DOCUMENT

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:37.442 region:rollup2
THAT'S CALLED THE BLUEPRINT FOR

00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:38.710 region:rollup2
GREAT SCHOOLS.

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:40.746 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:42.581 region:rollup2
AUTHORED BY A AND IT THE TO

00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:43.715 region:rollup2
ADVISORY GROUP A TO THE

00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:44.816 region:rollup2
SUPERINTENDENT.

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:46.618 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE MADE A FUNDAMENTAL

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:48.654 region:rollup2
SHIFT IN THE WAY THAT WE FUND

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:49.988 region:rollup2
SCHOLS AND DISTRICTS IN THE

00:29:48.654 --> 00:29:51.089 region:rollup2
LOCAL DECISION MAKING THAT WE

00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:52.591 region:rollup2
GAVE YOU THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO

00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:53.625 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS AND THE

00:29:52.591 --> 00:29:54.993 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE THAT WE PROVIDE TO

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:57.429 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:58.597 region:rollup2
SO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT WE TO

00:29:57.429 --> 00:30:00.332 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND CONTINUOUS

00:29:58.597 --> 00:30:01.867 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT IT BE IMPORTANT FOR

00:30:00.332 --> 00:30:04.436 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHERE WE CAME FROM

00:30:01.867 --> 00:30:05.804 region:rollup2
AND TO KNOWLEDGE WHERE WE CAME

00:30:04.436 --> 00:30:07.906 region:rollup2
FROM AND WHERE WE ARE NOW.

00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:10.142 region:rollup2
SO UNDER NCLB NO CHILD LEFT

00:30:07.906 --> 00:30:11.343 region:rollup2
BEHIND OF FEDERAL LAW AND PRIOR

00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:13.345 region:rollup2
TO.

00:30:11.343 --> 00:30:14.846 region:rollup2
LCF PFAFF WE HAD AN

00:30:13.345 --> 00:30:16.515 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM THAT WAS

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:19.051 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY DRIVEN.

00:30:16.515 --> 00:30:20.752 region:rollup2
IT WAS A VERY PRESCRIPTIVE.

00:30:19.051 --> 00:30:22.187 region:rollup2
I WANT YOU WERE IDENTIFIED FOR

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:23.989 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE AND YOUR ONE YOU HAD

00:30:22.187 --> 00:30:25.791 region:rollup2
TO DO SPECIFIC THINGS IN YOUR TO

00:30:23.989 --> 00:30:27.592 region:rollup2
YET TO DO SPECIFIC THINGS. THAN

00:30:25.791 --> 00:30:29.061 region:rollup2
THERE WERE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IN

00:30:27.592 --> 00:30:30.696 region:rollup2
IT WAS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

00:30:29.061 --> 00:30:32.798 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

00:30:30.696 --> 00:30:34.366 region:rollup2
WE WAS AN OVER RELIANCE ON THAT

00:30:32.798 --> 00:30:36.068 region:rollup2
SYSTEM ON TEST SCORES.

00:30:34.366 --> 00:30:38.136 region:rollup2
TEST SCORES AND GRADUATION

00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:40.138 region:rollup2
RATES WERE THE ONLY PART OF THAT

00:30:38.136 --> 00:30:41.373 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. IN IT WAS

00:30:40.138 --> 00:30:43.842 region:rollup2
A SYSTEM OF CONSEQUENCES

00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:45.210 region:rollup2
YOU BASICALLY TESTS SKIDS AND

00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:47.512 region:rollup2
PROVIDE JUDGMENT ON HOW THAT

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:49.047 region:rollup2
TESTING WENT.

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:50.716 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

00:30:49.047 --> 00:30:52.718 region:rollup2
FORMULA AND THE FLEXIBILITY

00:30:50.716 --> 00:30:53.785 region:rollup2
THAT'S PROVIDED UNDER.

00:30:52.718 --> 00:30:55.954 region:rollup2
* OUT THE EVERY STUDENT

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:57.255 region:rollup2
SUCCEEDS ACT.

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:58.857 region:rollup2
IT WE'VE NOW MOVED TO AN

00:30:57.255 --> 00:31:00.058 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM OF

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:02.127 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT WHICH IS

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:03.895 region:rollup2
STATE DRIVEN NOT FEDERALLY

00:31:02.127 --> 00:31:06.732 region:rollup2
DRIVEN IT'S BASED ON MULTIPLE

00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:08.367 region:rollup2
MEASURES NOT MOSTLY TEST SCORES

00:31:06.732 --> 00:31:09.968 region:rollup2
LIKE NCLB.

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:11.536 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDING IN THOSE.

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:13.872 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE MEASURES A CALIFORNIA

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:15.240 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DASHBOARD THAT PROVIDES

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:18.143 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY SCHOOL IN EVERY

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.444 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IN MULTIPLE AREAS HOW

00:31:18.143 --> 00:31:21.980 region:rollup2
THAT'S IS THAT SCHOOL IS

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:22.614 region:rollup2
PERFORMING NOT JUST CURRENTLY.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:25.450 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:27.753 region:rollup2
IN TREND DATA AS WELL FROM THE

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:29.054 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS YEAR TO NOW.

00:31:27.753 --> 00:31:30.255 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY THAT THE THE

00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:32.190 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WITH THE

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:33.859 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD PROVIDES FOR LOCAL

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:35.994 region:rollup2
INDICATORS AS WELL AS STATE

00:31:33.859 --> 00:31:37.529 region:rollup2
INDICATORS FOR STATE INDICATORS

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:39.064 region:rollup2
HAVE STATED THAT THE STATE HAS

00:31:37.529 --> 00:31:40.098 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE MAKE SOME SOME

00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:42.000 region:rollup2
CALCULATIONS INSTANT TENDER

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:44.236 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS. AND PROVIDE SOME

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.138 region:rollup2
DATA BACK TO COMMUNITIES ON HOW

00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:47.439 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING. BUT WE ADD TO

00:31:46.138 --> 00:31:49.174 region:rollup2
THAT AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM

00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:50.575 region:rollup2
HAS LOCAL INDICATORS BECAUSE

00:31:49.174 --> 00:31:52.277 region:rollup2
THERE'S INFORMATION OUT THERE

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:53.111 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE

00:31:52.277 --> 00:31:54.479 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:55.347 region:rollup2
LOCAL DATA SUCH AS HOW OUR

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:57.082 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS

00:31:55.347 --> 00:31:58.617 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THE STANDARDS HOW

00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:59.518 region:rollup2
ARE THEY DOING PROVIDING QUALITY

00:31:58.617 --> 00:32:01.286 region:rollup2
TEACHERS.

00:31:59.518 --> 00:32:03.321 region:rollup2
TO THEIR STUDENTS HOW ARE THEY

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:05.957 region:rollup2
DOING ENGAGING THEIR COMMUNITY

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:07.292 region:rollup2
AND THE SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL

00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:10.195 region:rollup2
CLIMATE OR THE DISTRICT CLIMATE

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:11.530 region:rollup2
AND WITHIN THAT ELLIE A.

00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:13.198 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALL OF THAT IS BASED ON

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:15.167 region:rollup2
A CYCLE OF IMPROVEMENT.

00:32:13.198 --> 00:32:17.035 region:rollup2
A A SYSTEM THAT STARTS WITH

00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:18.370 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT LOOKING AT DATA. THE

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:20.272 region:rollup2
DELIVERY OF SOME SERVICE SOME

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.007 region:rollup2
DESIGN OF THE SERVICES AND

00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:23.475 region:rollup2
DELIVERY OF THOSE SERVICES AND

00:32:22.007 --> 00:32:25.277 region:rollup2
THEN YOU EVALUATE HOW YOU'RE

00:32:23.475 --> 00:32:26.845 region:rollup2
DOING AND START THE CYCLE OVER

00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:28.180 region:rollup2
AGAIN TAKING A LOOK AT THE DATA

00:32:26.845 --> 00:32:29.548 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAVE. TO MAKE A

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.683 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER YOU

00:32:29.548 --> 00:32:33.118 region:rollup2
SHOULD REDESIGN WHAT YOU'VE

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:35.153 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY DONE.

00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:36.922 region:rollup2
SO ALL OF THAT.

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:38.657 region:rollup2
OR IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM

00:32:36.922 --> 00:32:40.058 region:rollup2
BUT THEN ON NEXT TO THAT IS THE

00:32:38.657 --> 00:32:41.760 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WHICH WILL

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:43.128 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT LATER BUT JUST SOME

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.930 region:rollup2
AN OVERVIEW OF THE DIFFERENCES

00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:47.098 region:rollup2
OF SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. FROM THE

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:48.834 region:rollup2
FEDERAL SYSTEM OF NO CHILD LEFT

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:50.569 region:rollup2
BEHIND TO WHERE WE ARE NOW UNDER

00:32:48.834 --> 00:32:52.304 region:rollup2
LCF AFTER NASA.

00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:54.372 region:rollup2
UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM VERY UNEVEN

00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:56.274 region:rollup2
RESULTS THERE WAS SOME SUCCESS

00:32:54.372 --> 00:32:58.410 region:rollup2
BUT IT WAS LIMITED SUCCESS

00:32:56.274 --> 00:33:00.312 region:rollup2
WE GAVE LARGE GRANTS. PER OF THE

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:02.113 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW TO INDIVIDUAL

00:33:00.312 --> 00:33:03.515 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS.

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:04.449 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS FINE AND SOME OF THEM

00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:06.151 region:rollup2
SHOULD SOME OF THEM EVEN SHOWED

00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:08.386 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT BUT ONCE THE MONEY

00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:09.888 region:rollup2
ONE AWAY. OFTEN THE IMPROVEMENT

00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:12.157 region:rollup2
WENT AWAY AS WELL BECAUSE IT

00:33:09.888 --> 00:33:13.692 region:rollup2
DIDN'T FOCUS ON SYSTEMIC RESULTS

00:33:12.157 --> 00:33:15.260 region:rollup2
AND IT DIDN'T FOCUS ON WORKING

00:33:13.692 --> 00:33:16.528 region:rollup2
WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.230 region:rollup2
COULD WHICH COULD HELP THE

00:33:16.528 --> 00:33:19.898 region:rollup2
SCHOOL OVER TIME.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.534 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THOSE GAINS A LONG TERM

00:33:19.898 --> 00:33:22.734 region:rollup2
AND SUSTAINABLE.

00:33:22.534 --> 00:33:25.036 region:rollup2
THE.

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:27.038 region:rollup2
IT OFTEN FOCUSED ON TEAMS

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:29.407 region:rollup2
COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE DROPPING

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:31.309 region:rollup2
INTO A SCHOOL AND THEN TRYING TO

00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:34.012 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW ASSIST THEM AND WHAT TO

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:36.047 region:rollup2
DO. AND IT IT IT ESTABLISH MORE

00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:37.716 region:rollup2
OF A CHECKLIST APPROACH THAN A

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:39.451 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE APPROACH.

00:33:37.716 --> 00:33:40.886 region:rollup2
SO THATWAS THE OLD SYSTEM UNDER

00:33:39.451 --> 00:33:42.287 region:rollup2
THE NEW SYSTEM OF SUPPORT UNDER

00:33:40.886 --> 00:33:44.890 region:rollup2
LCF AFFAN THE LIMITED

00:33:42.287 --> 00:33:46.424 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY THAT AS A GIVES US.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.792 region:rollup2
ONE THERE'S MORE DATA AVAILABLE

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:49.327 region:rollup2
TO THE SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS AND

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:50.996 region:rollup2
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. MORE IN

00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:52.564 region:rollup2
THE DASHBOARD.

00:33:50.996 --> 00:33:54.332 region:rollup2
THESE ARE KNOWN PARTNERS BECAUSE

00:33:52.564 --> 00:33:55.934 region:rollup2
THE FIRST LINE OF INTERVENTION

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:57.469 region:rollup2
IS WITH THE COUNTY OFFICES

00:33:55.934 --> 00:33:58.837 region:rollup2
COUNTY OFFICES ARE VERY FAMILIAR

00:33:57.469 --> 00:34:00.105 region:rollup2
WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:33:58.837 --> 00:34:01.206 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT

00:34:00.105 --> 00:34:02.774 region:rollup2
APPROVED THEIR BUDGET ANDREA AB

00:34:01.206 --> 00:34:03.842 region:rollup2
TWELVE UNDER. THEIR THE ONES

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:05.977 region:rollup2
THAT PROVE THEIR LOCAL CONTROL

00:34:03.842 --> 00:34:07.846 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN ANNUALLY SO

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:08.980 region:rollup2

TE TO THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:13.685 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT JUST SOMEONE

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:15.520 region:rollup2
DROPPING IN FROM THE OUTSIDE

00:34:13.685 --> 00:34:17.289 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE CONTEXT.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.890 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT IT IS LIKE A COUNTY

OFFICE DOES.

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:22.160 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE KNOWN PARTNERS THAT

00:34:20.292 --> 00:34:23.562 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO BE A TEAM APPROACH

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.163 region:rollup2
THAT'S A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH

00:34:23.562 --> 00:34:27.399 region:rollup2
TO TAKES A LOOK AND HELPS THE

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:30.235 region:rollup2

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:32.671 region:rollup2
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. IN A SELF

00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:34.439 region:rollup2
KIND OF A SELF DISCOVERY PROCESS

00:34:32.671 --> 00:34:36.041 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT WERE COMING IN AND THE

00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:37.175 region:rollup2

00:34:38.777 --> 00:34:42.280 region:rollup2
THAT WAS KIND OF THAT'S KIND OF

00:34:39.678 --> 00:34:44.316 region:rollup2
THE OLD APPROACH NEW APPROACH IS

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.850 region:rollup2
COMING ALONG SIDE. I'M FAMILIAR

00:34:44.316 --> 00:34:47.285 region:rollup2

WANT TO TRY. TO.

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:59.798 region:rollup2
AND TO IMPROVE.

00:34:57.896 --> 00:35:01.1000 region:rollup2
HOW THINGS ARE GOING?

00:34:59.798 --> 00:35:04.302 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WE GET WHERE WE.

00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:10.909 region:rollup2
SO IT'S LOCAL PRIORITIES LOCAL

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:12.177 region:rollup2

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:43.648 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS. AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE

00:44:41.546 --> 00:44:45.683 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR THESE DISTINGUISHING

00:44:43.648 --> 00:44:47.385 region:rollup2
AREAS OF WORK THAT WILL CURRENT

00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:49.754 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM A SUPPORT INCLUDE

00:44:47.385 --> 00:44:52.456 region:rollup2
THAT RECALLS ANALYSIS THAT

00:44:49.754 --> 00:44:54.926 region:rollup2
CARICATURE BLAMED THAT PATHWAYS

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:58.329 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT ASSISTANCE BECAUSE

00:44:54.926 --> 00:44:58.963 region:rollup2
NOT EVERY ALLEY A HAS THE SAME

00:44:58.329 --> 00:44:59.931 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

00:44:58.963 --> 00:45:00.531 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT AND SO WE'RE MAKING

00:44:59.931 --> 00:45:01.799 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE HAVE EQUITY OF

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.700 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE SUPPORTS THE

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:03.801 region:rollup2
INITIAL OUTREACH TO ELEAZAR THE

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.435 region:rollup2
REVIEW OF DATA THAT SUPPORTS

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:05.136 region:rollup2
ALLEYWAYS IN THEIR SCHOOLS TO

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:06.437 region:rollup2
IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES.

00:45:05.136 --> 00:45:07.605 region:rollup2
AND CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH TO

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:08.272 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE UNDER LC FF DIFFERS

00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:09.473 region:rollup2
GREATLY FROM THE PAST AND IS A

00:45:08.272 --> 00:45:10.908 region:rollup2
FORMER PRINCIPAL OF A SCHOOL

00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:12.443 region:rollup2
THAT WAS UNDER LCL BE.

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:13.778 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM I CAN

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:15.813 region:rollup2
HONESTLY SAY THIS IS A VERY

00:45:13.778 --> 00:45:17.949 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT APPROACH IS ABOUT

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:19.617 region:rollup2
GETTING IN WITH THE LA AND

00:45:17.949 --> 00:45:20.885 region:rollup2
HELPING THEM DETERMINE WHAT ARE

00:45:19.617 --> 00:45:23.354 region:rollup2
THE ROOT CAUSES WHAT ARE THEIR

00:45:20.885 --> 00:45:24.555 region:rollup2
BARRIERS. TO PROVIDING QUALITY

00:45:23.354 --> 00:45:26.090 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION TO EVERY SINGLE

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:28.125 region:rollup2
STUDENT AT THEIR SCHOOL SO THIS

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:29.727 region:rollup2
IS A VERY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:31.329 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE THE THREE OF THESE

00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:32.797 region:rollup2
KEY STEPS REFLECT THAT. THE

00:45:31.329 --> 00:45:34.198 region:rollup2
INTENT THAT DIFFERENTIATED

00:45:32.797 --> 00:45:35.633 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE TO TAILOR IT TO BE

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:38.369 region:rollup2
TAYLOR TO LOCALLY IDENTIFIED

00:45:35.633 --> 00:45:39.236 region:rollup2
NEEDS RATHER THAN IMPOSE AS A

00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:41.806 region:rollup2
ONE SIZE FITS ALL.

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:43.374 region:rollup2
SOLUTION SO THAT SOME OF THESE.

00:45:41.806 --> 00:45:45.176 region:rollup2
SHIPS INCLUDE SUPPORT PROVIDERS

00:45:43.374 --> 00:45:46.577 region:rollup2
WORKING ALONGSIDE ELEAZAR AND

00:45:45.176 --> 00:45:48.179 region:rollup2
THEIR SCHOOLS TO IDENTIFY KEY

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:49.847 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

00:45:48.179 --> 00:45:51.148 region:rollup2
USING A SYSTEMIC APPROACH

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:52.483 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO LOCALLY IDENTIFIED

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:54.285 region:rollup2
NEEDS AND STRENGTHS BECAUSE

00:45:52.483 --> 00:45:55.653 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT IS

00:45:54.285 --> 00:45:56.454 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT. THEIR ISSUES ARE

00:45:55.653 --> 00:45:58.256 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND THEIR STRENGTHS

00:45:56.454 --> 00:45:59.223 region:rollup2
ARE DIFFERENT AND ENGAGING WITH

00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:00.358 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL EDUCATORS AND

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:01.892 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IS AS PART OF THE

00:46:00.358 --> 00:46:03.260 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKING PROCESS.

00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:04.929 region:rollup2
SO STOP THERE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.896 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS

00:46:04.929 --> 00:46:08.566 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S A REALLY EXCITING

00:46:05.896 --> 00:46:10.067 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS CD

00:46:08.566 --> 00:46:11.902 region:rollup2
AN ALLEY A SPEEDY ABLE TO

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:13.204 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN A SYSTEM. THAT IS

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:14.138 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE INDIVIDUALIZED FOR

00:46:13.204 --> 00:46:16.374 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL.

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:18.242 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:46:16.374 --> 00:46:19.844 region:rollup2
SAP GOOD AFTERNOON I'M I'D LIKE

00:46:18.242 --> 00:46:21.646 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THREE

00:46:19.844 --> 00:46:22.613 region:rollup2
ISSUES FIRST JUST THE BILL A

00:46:21.646 --> 00:46:24.315 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ON WHAT MISTER

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:25.116 region:rollup2
GREGSON SHARED ABOUT THE SYSTEM

00:46:24.315 --> 00:46:26.784 region:rollup2
OF SUPPORT WITHIN THE

00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:28.352 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. THOSE

00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:30.621 region:rollup2
THREE LEVELS OF ASSISTANCE THAT

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:32.223 region:rollup2
BUT THAT SHE DESCRIBED THE

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:33.157 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR ALL WEREN'T DEAD. IT

00:46:32.223 --> 00:46:34.558 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE AN

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:35.760 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE INTERVENTION VERY

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:37.862 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE APPROACH FOR

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.296 region:rollup2
MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT

00:46:37.862 --> 00:46:40.665 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A FRAMEWORK THAT USE

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:41.999 region:rollup2
FOR DELIVERY OF INSTRUCTION AND

00:46:40.665 --> 00:46:43.734 region:rollup2
SERVICES IN THE CLASSROOM AND

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:45.603 region:rollup2
SCHOOL LEVEL. SO IT'S A FAMILIAR

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:47.405 region:rollup2
CONCEPT TO EDUCATORS THAT SORT

00:46:45.603 --> 00:46:48.973 region:rollup2
OF HAS BEEN INCORPORATED AS THE

00:46:47.405 --> 00:46:50.541 region:rollup2
FRAME FOR OVERALL SYSTEM OF

00:46:48.973 --> 00:46:51.642 region:rollup2
SUPPORT. AND ONE THING THAT'S

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:53.711 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:54.779 region:rollup2
DECISION IS TO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF

00:46:53.711 --> 00:46:56.914 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORT FOR ALL WHICH IS

00:46:54.779 --> 00:46:58.115 region:rollup2
THERE'S LEVEL WINDS SUPPORTS.

00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:59.016 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:46:58.115 --> 00:47:00.551 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IS THAT YOUR WRITING

00:46:59.016 --> 00:47:01.852 region:rollup2
GENERAL SUPPORT ABOUT HOW TO

00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:03.321 region:rollup2
PROVIDE QUALITY INSTRUCTION TO

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:04.388 region:rollup2
ENGLISH LEARNERS IT'S NOT

00:47:03.321 --> 00:47:05.923 region:rollup2
TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:06.857 region:rollup2
WE'RE COMMUNICATING ABOUT HOW

00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:08.659 region:rollup2
BRIGHT QUALITY INSTRUCTION ON

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:09.894 region:rollup2
SPECIAL EDUCATION? SO THIS IDEA

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:11.395 region:rollup2
OF ALIGNING IN COORDINATING

00:47:09.894 --> 00:47:12.997 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS THREE IS INTEGRATED

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:13.831 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WE BELIEVE IS THE

00:47:12.997 --> 00:47:15.733 region:rollup2
STARTING POINT IS WHAT YOU

00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:16.634 region:rollup2
PROVIDE FOR ALL IN YOU BUILD ON

00:47:15.733 --> 00:47:18.102 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN YOU PROVIDE

00:47:16.634 --> 00:47:19.470 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE TO

00:47:18.102 --> 00:47:21.439 region:rollup2
ENSURE THERE'S LESS OF A

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:23.007 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT APPROACH. AS FAR AS

00:47:21.439 --> 00:47:24.675 region:rollup2
HOW I WERE ASKING LOCAL

00:47:23.007 --> 00:47:26.010 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO SUPPORT

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:27.745 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:29.046 region:rollup2
SECOND OR JUST A HIGH WEIGHT ON

00:47:27.745 --> 00:47:30.815 region:rollup2
THE CROSS AGENCY GROUP THAT MISS

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:32.249 region:rollup2
GREGSON REFERENCED.

00:47:30.815 --> 00:47:33.651 region:rollup2
THAT'S INITIALLY STARTED WITH

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:34.885 region:rollup2
THE AGENCIES THAT ARE CHARGED BY

00:47:33.651 --> 00:47:36.220 region:rollup2
STATUTE WITH PROVIDING

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:36.654 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE INITIATE ITS BEEN

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.322 region:rollup2
EXPANDED TO INCLUDE

00:47:36.654 --> 00:47:39.356 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS.

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:40.591 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT'S REALLY

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:42.026 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WERE MODELING

00:47:40.591 --> 00:47:43.294 region:rollup2
THE ENGAGEMENT THAT WE EXPECT

00:47:42.026 --> 00:47:44.395 region:rollup2
ELEAZAR HAVE AND THEIR

00:47:43.294 --> 00:47:45.996 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR LOCAL

00:47:44.395 --> 00:47:47.231 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS. ENSURING

00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:49.200 region:rollup2
THAT STAKEHOLDERS ARE ENGAGED IN

00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:50.935 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS HELPING TO IDENTIFY

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.503 region:rollup2
AREAS OF NEED IN PLACES THAT THE

00:47:50.935 --> 00:47:54.205 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THEMSELVES CAN FOCUS ON

00:47:52.503 --> 00:47:56.273 region:rollup2
A COORDINATE BETTER ON. AND

00:47:54.205 --> 00:47:57.441 region:rollup2
PROVIDING SUPPORT.

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:58.776 region:rollup2
AND AS HAS BEEN NOTED THIS

00:47:57.441 --> 00:48:00.077 region:rollup2
APPROACH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM

00:47:58.776 --> 00:48:01.612 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE DONE THE PAST I THINK

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:03.013 region:rollup2
WHAT I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IS

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:05.216 region:rollup2
THAT IN CONTRAST THE PAST OUR

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:07.184 region:rollup2
CURRENT SYSTEM. INSISTS THAT

00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:08.886 region:rollup2
LOCAL DECISION MAKERS OWN THE

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:10.855 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND TOGETHER WITH

00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:12.256 region:rollup2
THEIR STAKEHOLDERS IDENTIFY

00:48:10.855 --> 00:48:13.724 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING CAUSES FOR LOW

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:15.092 region:rollup2
STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOP

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:16.727 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS THAT THEY'RE

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:18.396 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING. IN

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:20.164 region:rollup2
THE ROLE FOR THE STATE SYSTEM OF

00:48:18.396 --> 00:48:21.565 region:rollup2
SUPPORT. IS TO COORDINATE AND

00:48:20.164 --> 00:48:22.900 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ASSISTANCE THAT'S

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:25.436 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVE TO THIS LIKELY

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.837 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED NEEDS.

00:48:25.436 --> 00:48:27.905 region:rollup2
THE SECOND POINT I TALK ABOUT IS

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:29.240 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE IN THE

00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:30.541 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF LCF HALF

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.976 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTEEN WAS WHEN THE LAW

00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:34.545 region:rollup2
WAS PASSED WORKS ARE GETTING

00:48:31.976 --> 00:48:35.679 region:rollup2
INTO THE THAT. THAT YEAR

00:48:34.545 --> 00:48:37.515 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY HERE FIVE

00:48:35.679 --> 00:48:38.983 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION.

00:48:37.515 --> 00:48:40.418 region:rollup2
THE TWO TOOLS THAT SORT OF TELL

00:48:38.983 --> 00:48:42.119 region:rollup2
CFF CALLED FOR THE LOCAL

00:48:40.418 --> 00:48:43.454 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS THAT THAT

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:45.790 region:rollup2
LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES MUST

00:48:43.454 --> 00:48:47.158 region:rollup2
ADOPT AND AN UPDATE ANNUALLY AS

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:48.492 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE EVALUATION RUBRICS

00:48:47.158 --> 00:48:50.094 region:rollup2
WHICH NASH UP IN THE CALIFORNIA

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:50.828 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DASHBOARD THAT YOU'VE

00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:52.196 region:rollup2
HEARD DESCRIBED.

00:48:50.828 --> 00:48:54.432 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE ALWAYS INTENDED TO

00:48:52.196 --> 00:48:55.833 region:rollup2
WORK TOGETHER THAT THE DATA IT

00:48:54.432 --> 00:48:57.334 region:rollup2
REFLECTED IN THE DASHBOARD IS

00:48:55.833 --> 00:48:57.902 region:rollup2
USED TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:59.870 region:rollup2
OF THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY

00:48:57.902 --> 00:49:01.138 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:02.473 region:rollup2
IT IS THE TASK FORCE ACTUALLY

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:03.808 region:rollup2
COMPLETES THE LOCAL PLANNING

00:49:02.473 --> 00:49:04.341 region:rollup2
PROCESS THE WAY IT WAS ALWAYS

00:49:03.808 --> 00:49:06.310 region:rollup2
INTENDED WHEN LCF ACT WAS

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:07.545 region:rollup2
PASSED.

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:08.979 region:rollup2
BUT THE FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:49:07.545 --> 00:49:10.915 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD WHICH WAS RELEASED IN

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:12.817 region:rollup2
DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS

00:49:10.915 --> 00:49:14.218 region:rollup2
THE FIRST OPERATIONAL RELEASE OF

00:49:12.817 --> 00:49:15.252 region:rollup2
THE DASHBOARD THE FIRST YEAR

00:49:14.218 --> 00:49:16.754 region:rollup2
WHERE THE DEEP WHERE THE GAS WAS

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:18.355 region:rollup2
RELEASED WITH DATA FROM THE

00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:19.890 region:rollup2
PRIOR YEAR.

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:21.859 region:rollup2
SO REALLY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:23.694 region:rollup2
THAT THE SYSTEM WITH THOSE TOO

00:49:21.859 --> 00:49:25.062 region:rollup2
STATE KEY STATE TOOLS ARE

00:49:23.694 --> 00:49:26.297 region:rollup2
WORKING IN CONCERT TOGETHER AND

00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:28.098 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE WILL VERY MUCH

00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:30.134 region:rollup2
STRENGTH AND. THE LOCAL PLANNING

00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:31.802 region:rollup2
PROCESS AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN

00:49:30.134 --> 00:49:33.137 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY ENHANCE AND MAKE

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:34.672 region:rollup2
MORE RICH THE DISCUSSIONS WITH

00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:36.774 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE THAT DATA

00:49:34.672 --> 00:49:38.142 region:rollup2
PROVIDED REALLY HELP FOCUS WHERE

00:49:36.774 --> 00:49:39.910 region:rollup2
THERE'S LOCAL CONVERSATIONS

00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:40.778 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO USE RESOURCES. TO

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:43.080 region:rollup2
MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS

00:49:40.778 --> 00:49:44.114 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE FOCUSED.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.982 region:rollup2
AND THE FINAL POINT IS YOU KNOW

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:46.350 region:rollup2
MAYBE YOU'RE THINKING THIS

00:49:44.982 --> 00:49:47.451 region:rollup2
SOUNDS NICE BUT WHAT DOES IT

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.686 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE AND HOW DOES THIS MAKE

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:50.287 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENCE FOR STUDENTS IN

00:49:48.686 --> 00:49:51.455 region:rollup2
CLASSROOMS.

00:49:50.287 --> 00:49:52.723 region:rollup2
I THINK WITH THE WE HAD A LOT OF

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:54.124 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON WHAT LIES AHEAD WHICH

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:56.093 region:rollup2
WE OFTEN LOSE SIGHT OF THIS

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:58.329 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LIVE TODAY COUNTIES AND

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:59.497 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED

00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:01.098 region:rollup2
AS HER DISTRICTS ARE DEFINED AS

00:49:59.497 --> 00:50:02.499 region:rollup2
NEEDING EXTRA ASSISTANCE. ON THE

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:03.601 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD OF WORKING WITH

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:05.035 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AS WE SPEAK

00:50:03.601 --> 00:50:06.737 region:rollup2
SO I'D LIKE TO JUST POINT TO AN

00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:08.138 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THIS

00:50:06.737 --> 00:50:09.340 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT APPROACH THAT YOU'VE

00:50:08.138 --> 00:50:11.041 region:rollup2
HEARD DESCRIBED BEFORE NOW THIS

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.276 region:rollup2
IS AN EXAMPLE. FROM ONE OF THE

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:13.677 region:rollup2
NETWORKS THAT THE CALIFORNIA

00:50:12.276 --> 00:50:15.312 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:16.780 region:rollup2
EXCELLENCE IS FACILITATING BUT

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:17.781 region:rollup2
THE APPROACH IS VERY SIMILAR TO

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.083 region:rollup2
HOW COUNTIES ARE WORKING

00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:20.951 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALLY WITH DISTRICTS

00:50:19.083 --> 00:50:22.586 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED ON THE DASHBOARD.

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:23.988 region:rollup2
IN THIS EXAMPLE DISTRICT STAFF

00:50:22.586 --> 00:50:25.356 region:rollup2
HAD COMPLETED A REVIEW OF DAY AT

00:50:23.988 --> 00:50:26.790 region:rollup2
AROUND SIX REALLY TROUBLING

00:50:25.356 --> 00:50:28.325 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION RATES AND WHAT IT

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.560 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING CAUSES.

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:30.861 region:rollup2
AT THE LAST SESSION THAT COME UP

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.096 region:rollup2
WITH ISSUES THAT ARE PRETTY MUCH

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:33.864 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE

00:50:32.096 --> 00:50:36.066 region:rollup2
SCHOOL ITSELF. GENERATIONAL

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:37.368 region:rollup2
POVERTY GUY GENERATIONAL POVERTY

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:38.836 region:rollup2
LIMITED PARENT INVOLVEMENT

00:50:37.368 --> 00:50:39.970 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE BARRIERS FOR EXAMPLE.

00:50:38.836 --> 00:50:41.805 region:rollup2
AT THE START OF THE NEXT SESSION

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:43.007 region:rollup2
THE FACILITATOR RELIGIOUS

00:50:41.805 --> 00:50:43.841 region:rollup2
REFRAIN THE DISCUSSION IS SAID

00:50:43.007 --> 00:50:45.910 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL STUFF IT'S

00:50:43.841 --> 00:50:46.644 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OUR OF YOUR CONTROL

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:48.145 region:rollup2
LET'S FOCUS ON THINGS THAT

00:50:46.644 --> 00:50:49.880 region:rollup2
SCHOOL TIDBITS THE SCHOOL ITSELF

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:51.916 region:rollup2
CAN CONTROL.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.183 region:rollup2
THIS PROMPTED A RECOGNITION THAT

00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:54.785 region:rollup2
THEY WERE FOCUSED ON EXTERNAL

00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:56.287 region:rollup2
FACTORS IN COULD INSTEAD BE

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:58.122 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON THINGS THAT THEY

00:50:56.287 --> 00:50:59.790 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES. COULD CONTROL FOR

00:50:58.122 --> 00:51:00.591 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE SCHOOL CULTURE AN

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:02.293 region:rollup2
APPLICATION OF SUSPENSION

00:51:00.591 --> 00:51:03.761 region:rollup2
POLICIES.

00:51:02.293 --> 00:51:05.062 region:rollup2
THEY SHIFTED THE DISCUSSION FROM

00:51:03.761 --> 00:51:06.764 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WERE EXTERNAL TO THE

00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:07.831 region:rollup2
SCHOOL TO THINGS THAT THEY DID

00:51:06.764 --> 00:51:09.266 region:rollup2
HAVE CONTROL OVER AND REALLY

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:11.068 region:rollup2
MOVED INTO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF

00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:12.136 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION. ABOUT HOW THEY COULD

00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:13.571 region:rollup2
USE DATA TO INFORM THEIR OWN

00:51:12.136 --> 00:51:14.872 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKING.

00:51:13.571 --> 00:51:16.006 region:rollup2
THIS IS A REALLY DIFFERENT

00:51:14.872 --> 00:51:17.408 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION FROM WHAT WOULD

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:18.809 region:rollup2
OCCUR IF SOMEONE SHOULD UP WITH

00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:20.277 region:rollup2
A CLIPBOARD IN THE CHECKLIST AND

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:21.645 region:rollup2
SAID HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:23.314 region:rollup2
OUR PROGRAM THAT YOU NEED TO

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:24.848 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT AS A SOLUTION.

00:51:23.314 --> 00:51:27.451 region:rollup2
SIMILAR CONVERSATIONS WITH HER

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:28.852 region:rollup2
ABOUT MINDSET IN CULTURE SHIFT

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:30.321 region:rollup2
ARE TAKING PLACE ACROSS THE

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:30.955 region:rollup2
STATE AS WE SPEAK.

00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:32.323 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE LAYING THE

00:51:30.955 --> 00:51:33.624 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION FOR THE REALLY HARD

00:51:32.323 --> 00:51:35.693 region:rollup2
WORK THAT WE HAVE AHEAD OF US IS

00:51:33.624 --> 00:51:36.994 region:rollup2
A STATE OF DESIGNING AND

00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:38.662 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING EDUCATION PROGRAMS

00:51:36.994 --> 00:51:39.997 region:rollup2
AND RESPONSIVE TO STUDENT NEED.

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:41.065 region:rollup2
AND IN DOING THAT THAT'S HOW

00:51:39.997 --> 00:51:42.800 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA MAKE PROGRESS IN

00:51:41.065 --> 00:51:44.101 region:rollup2
NARROWING THE PERFORMANCE GAPS

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.703 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLE WITH IS

00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:46.770 region:rollup2
THE STATE STATE FOR DECADES. SO

00:51:45.703 --> 00:51:48.539 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LOOK

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:49.440 region:rollup2
TOWARDS YOUR QUESTIONS.

00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:50.808 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU ARE VERY WELL

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.375 region:rollup2
DONE ALL THE PANEL MEMBERS ARE

00:51:50.808 --> 00:51:53.243 region:rollup2
THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE

00:51:51.375 --> 00:51:55.946 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:57.781 region:rollup2
ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL.

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:58.916 region:rollup2
CENTER MORE LOCKED.

00:51:57.781 --> 00:52:00.818 region:rollup2
IF YOU WISH CHAIR JUST JUST A

00:51:58.916 --> 00:52:01.418 region:rollup2
COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS.

00:52:00.818 --> 00:52:03.387 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T PROVIDE POLICE THE

00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:04.421 region:rollup2
MATURE I HAVE A AN EXAMPLE OF

00:52:03.387 --> 00:52:07.491 region:rollup2
WHAT A DASHBOARD LOOKS LIKE.

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:08.392 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:09.860 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. OF

00:52:08.392 --> 00:52:10.661 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I AM GETTING. CONCERNED

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.896 region:rollup2
FROM PARENTS WERE SAYING IT'S

00:52:10.661 --> 00:52:13.430 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT.

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:15.633 region:rollup2
TO WORK THROUGH THAT THE

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.200 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD BUT I I'M JUST CHRIS

00:52:15.633 --> 00:52:18.135 region:rollup2
WHAT IS BEING MEASURED. AND

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.938 region:rollup2
THEN.

00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:24.575 region:rollup2
SINCE I'M WILL ANAL ON ON PAGE.

00:52:20.938 --> 00:52:26.377 region:rollup2
SEVEN OF TWELVE IN YOUR.

00:52:24.575 --> 00:52:28.145 region:rollup2
MONITORING ELLIE OUT ELLIE A

00:52:26.377 --> 00:52:29.546 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES YOU HAVE A GRAPH THAT

00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:31.515 region:rollup2
SAYS AMONG CALIFORNIA DISTRICTS.

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:33.751 region:rollup2
SIX HUNDRED AND THREE HAD LOW

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:34.785 region:rollup2
RATINGS FOR MATH OR ENGLISH.

00:52:33.751 --> 00:52:35.319 region:rollup2
THAT'S I'M JUST RUNNING TO MAYBE

00:52:34.785 --> 00:52:39.790 region:rollup2
YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT PAGE

00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:40.958 region:rollup2
SOMEONE.

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:41.525 region:rollup2
OR PERHAPS THAT'S IN THE PACKET

00:52:40.958 --> 00:52:41.959 region:rollup2
WE WILL SEE WHAT IS THE PAGE

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:43.827 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

00:52:41.959 --> 00:52:45.129 region:rollup2
SAYS SEVEN OF TWELVE.

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:47.164 region:rollup2
IT'S DATED MARCH TWENTY THIRD

00:52:45.129 --> 00:52:48.599 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO FIFTY FIVE PM

00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:50.000 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE

00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:53.671 region:rollup2
THIRD SEX.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:56.540 region:rollup2
IT'S GOT A BAR CHART.

00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:57.141 region:rollup2
WE'RE GETTING A PACKET SO WE CAN

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.975 region:rollup2
SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO IT.

00:52:57.141 --> 00:53:01.945 region:rollup2
BACK.

00:52:57.975 --> 00:53:03.680 region:rollup2
THAT'S IT.

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:15.859 region:rollup2
WE GIVE THEM A PACKET. SINCE

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:17.061 region:rollup2
ARE YOU HAVE EXCELLENCE.

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:18.362 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE WEB ALIVE WHAT TABS

00:53:17.061 --> 00:53:18.996 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S.

00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:21.331 region:rollup2
IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT MONITORING

00:53:18.996 --> 00:53:22.232 region:rollup2
LA A QUESTION.

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:23.667 region:rollup2
WELCOME TO SCHOOL DASHBOARD TEST

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:25.035 region:rollup2
SCORE RATINGS.

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:26.103 region:rollup2
AND SO I BELIEVE WE HAVE ELEVEN

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:27.905 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:53:26.103 --> 00:53:29.940 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY.

00:53:27.905 --> 00:53:31.809 region:rollup2
NO MORE THAN HALF OF THEM ARE.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.410 region:rollup2
YOU HAD LOW RATINGS FOR MATH OR

00:53:31.809 --> 00:53:34.178 region:rollup2
ENGLISH I JUST MAYBE SOMEONE

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:36.413 region:rollup2
COULD JUST COMMENT.

00:53:34.178 --> 00:53:37.781 region:rollup2
SO.

00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:39.016 region:rollup2
THIS SO I I THINK I THINK WITH

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:40.718 region:rollup2
THIS CHART IT COMES FROM A NEWS

00:53:39.016 --> 00:53:42.352 region:rollup2
ARTICLE THAT DID AN ANALYSIS OF

00:53:40.718 --> 00:53:43.620 region:rollup2
THE DASHBOARD DATE I BELIEVE

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:44.855 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IT. AND WHAT THIS

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.789 region:rollup2
SHOWS IS ACTUALLY INFORMATION

00:53:44.855 --> 00:53:48.358 region:rollup2
THAT IS REPORTED ON THE

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:50.127 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD WHICH IS IF ED IF IT

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:51.595 region:rollup2
DISTRICT OR A SCHOOL OR ANY

00:53:50.127 --> 00:53:54.031 region:rollup2
STUDENT GROUP WITHIN DISTRICT OR

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:56.300 region:rollup2
SCHOOL. IS PERFORMING LOW ON ANY

00:53:54.031 --> 00:53:57.901 region:rollup2
OF THE INDICATORS THAT DASHBOARD

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.969 region:rollup2
INCLUDES MULTIPLE MEASURES

00:53:57.901 --> 00:54:00.237 region:rollup2
INCLUDING TEST SCORES THE TEST

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:02.072 region:rollup2
SCORES IS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:54:00.237 --> 00:54:03.874 region:rollup2
INDICATOR. AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:54:02.072 --> 00:54:05.109 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BUT IT'S NO LONGER THE

00:54:03.874 --> 00:54:06.777 region:rollup2
ONLY INDICATOR SUCCESS.

00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:07.845 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY AS PART OF

00:54:06.777 --> 00:54:10.647 region:rollup2
THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WORK

00:54:07.845 --> 00:54:12.116 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY REPORTING DATA WE USED

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:13.650 region:rollup2
TO USING COLORS ARE RED BEING

00:54:12.116 --> 00:54:15.119 region:rollup2
THE LOWEST WORD MARKETING

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.487 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY BETTER BUT STILL LOW.

00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:18.155 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS TILING THAT WE

00:54:16.487 --> 00:54:19.356 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF DISTRICTS ACROSS

00:54:18.155 --> 00:54:20.491 region:rollup2
THE STATE THAT ARE STRUGGLING ON

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:21.925 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS.

00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:23.060 region:rollup2
AND ONE THING THAT I THINK IS

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:25.295 region:rollup2
IT IS IMPORTANT GOING BACK TO

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:27.698 region:rollup2
POINT I MADE ABOUT THE LEVEL ONE

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:30.367 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORT FOR ALL. THE STATE

00:54:27.698 --> 00:54:30.968 region:rollup2
BOARD REVISE THE A PLAN TEMPLATE

00:54:30.367 --> 00:54:33.871 region:rollup2
FOR THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY

00:54:30.968 --> 00:54:35.639 region:rollup2
PLANS TO EVERY YEAR. DISTRICTS

00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:36.974 region:rollup2
NOW WE HAVE A DASHBOARD HAVE TO

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:38.008 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THEIR DOUBTS WERE DATA

00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:39.409 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE'S A SINGLE

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:40.944 region:rollup2
INDICATOR WHERE THEY HAVE A RED

00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:42.346 region:rollup2
OR ORANGE WHICH OF THOSE TWO

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:43.981 region:rollup2
LOWEST PERFORMANCE LEVELS. THE

00:54:42.346 --> 00:54:45.649 region:rollup2
NEED TO ADDRESS IN THEIR LOCAL

00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:46.950 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS WHAT

00:54:45.649 --> 00:54:48.685 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING TO ADDRESS THAT

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.453 region:rollup2
WITH THAT INDICATOR OF LIEU OF

00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:50.587 region:rollup2
LIVE PERFORMANCE.

00:54:49.453 --> 00:54:52.055 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS OUR OVERALL

00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:53.457 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WE'RE

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:55.192 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT LEAST

00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:56.927 region:rollup2
TWO INDICATORS WHERE DISTRICT TO

00:54:55.192 --> 00:54:58.595 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING AS FAR AS THAT'S WHAT

00:54:56.927 --> 00:55:00.531 region:rollup2
THE STATUTE HEALTHY FF ITSELF IN

00:54:58.595 --> 00:55:02.166 region:rollup2
STATUTE. SAID THAT THE

00:55:00.531 --> 00:55:03.400 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE FROM COUNTIES WHAT

00:55:02.166 --> 00:55:04.902 region:rollup2
WE'RE CALLING THAT LEVEL TO

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.236 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE WE

00:55:04.902 --> 00:55:08.071 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WHETHER A STUDENT GROUP

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:09.506 region:rollup2
IN A DISTRICT IS STRUGGLING ON

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:10.774 region:rollup2
AT LEAST TWO MEASURES.

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:12.943 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE AND READ IT

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:14.044 region:rollup2
BASICALLY ON TO THESE DASHBOARD

00:55:12.943 --> 00:55:15.412 region:rollup2
MEASURES THAT URBAN I IN

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:17.114 region:rollup2
MEASURING DIFFERENT THINGS A

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:18.582 region:rollup2
TEST SCORES AND SUSPENSION RATE

00:55:17.114 --> 00:55:20.584 region:rollup2
OR TEST SCORES IN GRAD RATE.

00:55:18.582 --> 00:55:21.752 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHEN COUNTIES REQUIRED TO

00:55:20.584 --> 00:55:22.986 region:rollup2
COME IN AND OFFER ASSISTANCE

00:55:21.752 --> 00:55:24.688 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:26.390 region:rollup2
COUNTY ASSISTANCE THEIR REQUIRED

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:27.825 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY THROUGH THEIR LOCAL

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:29.459 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN PROCESS.

00:55:27.825 --> 00:55:31.161 region:rollup2
ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO

00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:32.629 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT DATA REFLECT ON IT

00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:33.263 region:rollup2
AND DESCRIBE HOW THEIR

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:34.665 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING IT IN THEIR OWN LOCAL

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:35.332 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:55:34.665 --> 00:55:36.300 region:rollup2
FOR THE NUMBER I CAN ASSUME YOU

00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:39.636 region:rollup2
DIDN'T PUT THIS.

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:42.005 region:rollup2
.

00:55:39.636 --> 00:55:43.240 region:rollup2
BOOK TOGETHER NO CENTER MORE

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:45.042 region:rollup2
LACK OF HIT APOLOGIZE I ASSUME

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.943 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING YOU

00:55:45.042 --> 00:55:46.944 region:rollup2
COLLABORATED ON IT.

00:55:45.943 --> 00:55:48.512 region:rollup2
AND GAVE TO ASIDE I DID MEAN TO

00:55:46.944 --> 00:55:49.646 region:rollup2
PUT YOU ON THE SPOT THEN THE

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:51.281 region:rollup2
COULD COULD YOU EXPLAIN MAYBE

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:53.183 region:rollup2
THIS GRAPH.

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:54.484 region:rollup2
A BUSINESS A ONE FOR ONE.

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:56.353 region:rollup2
AT THAT THERE MAYBE ARE MORE

00:55:54.484 --> 00:56:00.123 region:rollup2
LATINO STUDENTS AT THIS

00:55:56.353 --> 00:56:01.992 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR SCHOOL.

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:03.760 region:rollup2
SO I.

00:56:01.992 --> 00:56:05.395 region:rollup2
I WOULD WANT TO TAKE A CLOSER

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:07.798 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING DATA.

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:09.299 region:rollup2
TO TO BE CONFIDENT IN AND

00:56:07.798 --> 00:56:10.801 region:rollup2
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT I I

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:12.436 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT BUT IF YOU IF

00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:14.538 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE OVERALL

00:56:12.436 --> 00:56:15.872 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE OF A DISTRICT.

00:56:14.538 --> 00:56:16.907 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW ALL STUDENTS ARE

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.941 region:rollup2
DOING SO THAT IS A WE WE THE

00:56:16.907 --> 00:56:19.576 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD PROVIDES A COLOR FOR

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:21.044 region:rollup2
ALL STUDENT IT ALSO PROVIDES

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:22.479 region:rollup2
COLORS JUST FOR INDIVIDUAL

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:24.381 region:rollup2
STUDENT GROUPS IF THEY HAD AT

00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:25.883 region:rollup2
LEAST THIRTY STUDENTS SO. THAT

00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:27.651 region:rollup2
ASK FOR REPORTS DATA BOTH FOR

00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:28.151 region:rollup2
OVERALL PERFORMANCE IN

00:56:27.651 --> 00:56:28.452 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT GROUP

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:30.220 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE

00:56:28.452 --> 00:56:33.056 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE LIKE.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:37.794 region:rollup2
ALL SIX HUNDRED DISTRICTS.

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:39.229 region:rollup2
THAT WERE SAMPLED.

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:40.330 region:rollup2
NOT SO MYSELF I CAN YOU'RE TIRED

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:41.231 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:43.066 region:rollup2
BAR CHART CORRECT JACQUELINE

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:44.868 region:rollup2
YEAH SO UNDERSTOOD JUST TO BE

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:46.069 region:rollup2
CLEAR AND. WHAT IT SAYS AND

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:49.406 region:rollup2
AGAIN I HAVE? I DIDN'T DO THIS

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:50.674 region:rollup2
REPORT BUT WHAT IT SAYS IS IT'S

00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:52.809 region:rollup2
MATH OR. READING ENGLISH

00:56:50.674 --> 00:56:54.544 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE ARTS SO IT'S NOT BOTH

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:56.213 region:rollup2
OF ITS ONE OR THE OTHER WE

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:58.382 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT A THOUSAND

00:56:56.213 --> 00:57:00.984 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ANOTHER.

00:56:58.382 --> 00:57:02.686 region:rollup2
THOUSAND OR CLOSE TO CHARTER

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:04.788 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS CHARTER SCHOOLS GET

00:57:02.686 --> 00:57:06.123 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN DASHBOARD AS WELL IT'S

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:07.457 region:rollup2
NOT ROLLED UP THEIR DISTRICT

00:57:06.123 --> 00:57:08.759 region:rollup2
THEY GET THEIR OWN. BECAUSE

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:11.028 region:rollup2
THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO THEIR OWN

00:57:08.759 --> 00:57:11.595 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY

00:57:11.028 --> 00:57:13.730 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:15.699 region:rollup2
IN THIS THIS REFERS TO NOT

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:17.234 region:rollup2
OVERALL SCORES BUT WHAT IS THIS

00:57:15.699 --> 00:57:18.602 region:rollup2
THIS IS SAYING IS AB THREE SIX

00:57:17.234 --> 00:57:20.637 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THREE.

00:57:18.602 --> 00:57:22.406 region:rollup2
IN THESE THREE HUNDRED SIX

00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:24.141 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THREE DISTRICTS THEY HAD

00:57:22.406 --> 00:57:26.243 region:rollup2
AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE STUDENT

00:57:24.141 --> 00:57:28.312 region:rollup2
GROUPS END UP IN THE RATHER THE

00:57:26.243 --> 00:57:29.746 region:rollup2
ORANGE SO OVERALL THEY MAY BE

00:57:28.312 --> 00:57:32.182 region:rollup2
DOING VERY WELL AND THIS IS THE.

00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:33.750 region:rollup2
THE VERY INTENT OF THE DASHBOARD

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:35.452 region:rollup2
OVERALL THEY MAY BE DOING VERY

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:37.454 region:rollup2
WELL BUT IF THEY HAVE A STUDENT

00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:38.689 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT GROUP VIET

00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:40.390 region:rollup2
ENGLISH LEARNERS SPECIAL

00:57:38.689 --> 00:57:42.426 region:rollup2
EDUCATION STUDENT RACE AND

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:44.161 region:rollup2
ETHNICITY WHATEVER IT IS. THAT'S

00:57:42.426 --> 00:57:45.395 region:rollup2
IN THE RED ORANGE THEY NEED TO

00:57:44.161 --> 00:57:47.030 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT IT'S NOT GOOD

00:57:45.395 --> 00:57:47.664 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO SAY WILL OVERALL WERE

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:49.933 region:rollup2
DOING WELL.

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:52.436 region:rollup2
SO THIS PARTICULAR CHART POINTS

00:57:49.933 --> 00:57:55.439 region:rollup2
OUT THOSE THAT HAD ONE OR MORE

00:57:52.436 --> 00:57:56.006 region:rollup2
OF ONE OF THOSE STUDENT GROUPS.

00:57:55.439 --> 00:57:56.840 region:rollup2
DONALD WHEN THE RHETORIC BAR

00:57:56.006 --> 00:57:59.176 region:rollup2
THEN THAT HAS ANY COLOR

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.743 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATION IS AFRICAN

00:57:59.176 --> 00:58:02.312 region:rollup2
AMERICAN SO WHAT WOULD THAT

00:57:59.743 --> 00:58:03.113 region:rollup2
MEAN.

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:05.282 region:rollup2
BUT IT WOULD HELP MAYBE HAVE

00:58:03.113 --> 00:58:07.584 region:rollup2
MORE STUDENTS THAT HAVE ISSUES

00:58:05.282 --> 00:58:10.053 region:rollup2
ON THAT PARTICULAR BAR.

00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:11.955 region:rollup2
IT'S SO IT IS SET SO THIS CHART

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:14.224 region:rollup2
SHOWS THAT CUT THE TWO COLORS IN

00:58:11.955 --> 00:58:16.360 region:rollup2
THE BARS ARE JUST DISTRICTS OVER

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:17.861 region:rollup2
ALL IN DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.196 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:21.031 region:rollup2
FROM COUNTIES SO THE LIGHTER

00:58:19.196 --> 00:58:22.466 region:rollup2
COLOR IN THIS IS THERE IS THAT

00:58:21.031 --> 00:58:23.633 region:rollup2
WERE IDENTIFIED TO RECEIVE

00:58:22.466 --> 00:58:25.502 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE FROM COUNTIES.

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:26.803 region:rollup2
THANK YOU RICHARD

00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:27.871 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU JUST JUST

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:29.339 region:rollup2
TREMONT FRYING CLARIFICATION TO

00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:30.674 region:rollup2
A SUB GROUP IS DEFINED AS THIRTY

00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:32.542 region:rollup2
OR MORE AT A SCHOOL OR ADDED IN

00:58:30.674 --> 00:58:33.577 region:rollup2
A DISTRICT.

00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:35.946 region:rollup2
WELL IN EITHER CASE

00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:39.282 region:rollup2
A EITHER.

00:58:35.946 --> 00:58:40.884 region:rollup2
OKAY MORE AND MORE EITHER.

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:44.254 region:rollup2
YEAH UNDERSTOOD VERY WELL DONE.

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:47.124 region:rollup2
I THINK SENATOR ALLEN.

00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:50.427 region:rollup2
WHO HAS JOINED US I WANTED TO?

00:58:47.124 --> 00:58:51.595 region:rollup2
YEAH I WANTED TO AND.

00:58:50.427 --> 00:58:53.530 region:rollup2
TWO IS TO TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT

00:58:51.595 --> 00:58:55.332 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:56.633 region:rollup2
HOW WE MAKE THE STASHED FOR MORE

00:58:55.332 --> 00:58:59.870 region:rollup2
USER FRIENDLY AND I THINK WE

00:58:56.633 --> 00:59:01.905 region:rollup2
HAVE WHO THE VISIT I DON'T?

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:03.774 region:rollup2
DISAGREE THAT THE MOVE AWAY FROM

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:05.742 region:rollup2
A SINGLE.

00:59:03.774 --> 00:59:07.911 region:rollup2
NUMBER THAT.

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:09.279 region:rollup2
OSTENSIBLY SUMMED UP ALL OF THE

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:11.081 region:rollup2
PLUSES AND MINUSES MINUSES OF AN

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:13.283 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL OR INDIVIDUAL

00:59:11.081 --> 00:59:15.318 region:rollup2
ENTITY WAS AND. WAS OVERLY

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:17.521 region:rollup2
SIMPLE SIMPLISTIC I I I I I I I

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:18.822 region:rollup2
THINK THAT TIME. IT WAS OVERLY

00:59:17.521 --> 00:59:20.791 region:rollup2
SIMPLISTIC BUT.

00:59:18.822 --> 00:59:22.626 region:rollup2
I'M BUT I THINK THAT.

00:59:20.791 --> 00:59:24.194 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE HEART OF SOME OF THE

00:59:22.626 --> 00:59:27.197 region:rollup2
EDUCATION OF THE THE FEDERAL

00:59:24.194 --> 00:59:31.401 region:rollup2
EDUCATION APARTMENTS CONCERNS.

00:59:27.197 --> 00:59:33.403 region:rollup2
WHO WERE? WORDS DID IT THEY DID

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:35.105 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY THIS THE DASHBOARD

00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:36.373 region:rollup2
THIS IS JUST IT'S BEEN SO

00:59:35.105 --> 00:59:38.175 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED.

00:59:36.373 --> 00:59:39.209 region:rollup2
THAT IT REALLY GIVES.

00:59:38.175 --> 00:59:40.544 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW LEASES ORIGINALLY

00:59:39.209 --> 00:59:42.579 region:rollup2
PROPOSED EARLY GAVE NO CLEAR

00:59:40.544 --> 00:59:43.613 region:rollup2
IDEA OF HOW WELL A SCHOOL IS

00:59:42.579 --> 00:59:45.615 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING OVERALL IN AND.

00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:46.883 region:rollup2
I.

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:48.919 region:rollup2
I THINK WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:50.554 region:rollup2
PARENTS TO.

00:59:48.919 --> 00:59:52.956 region:rollup2
INTERPRET. OR UNDERSTAND.

00:59:50.554 --> 00:59:55.058 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:56.726 region:rollup2
SO OUR I I WANNA GET A LITTLE

00:59:55.058 --> 00:59:58.495 region:rollup2
BIT DOWN INTO THAT QUESTION YOU

00:59:56.726 --> 01:00:00.330 region:rollup2
KNOW WILL. WE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

00:59:58.495 --> 01:00:02.265 region:rollup2
US AS POLICYMAKERS AND FOR BOARD

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:03.900 region:rollup2
MEMBERS IN.

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:05.602 region:rollup2
OUR FOLKS IN THE VARIOUS LEVELS

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:07.370 region:rollup2
OF THE. EDUCATIONAL GOVERNMENT'S

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.705 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRACY TO UNDERSTAND AND

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:10.774 region:rollup2
AND BE ABLE TO TO MONITOR

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:11.374 region:rollup2
PROGRESS AT SCHOOLS NOW BUT

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.976 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO A KIND OF BROADER

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:15.178 region:rollup2
PUBLIC.

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:16.346 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF THIS AND AS IT RELATES

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:18.615 region:rollup2
TO PARENTS AND STUDENTS AND WHAT

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:20.117 region:rollup2
ARE WE DOING TO TO TRULY MAKE

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.852 region:rollup2
THIS SYSTEM MORE USER FRIENDLY

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:23.320 region:rollup2
FOR PARENTS WHILE ALSO.

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:28.692 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZINGTHE COMPLEXITY OF

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:30.560 region:rollup2
THE WORK.

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:30.727 region:rollup2
I'D BE GLAD IF THE START YEAH.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.496 region:rollup2
SO.

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:33.063 region:rollup2
.

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:35.198 region:rollup2
SO FIRST.

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:37.167 region:rollup2
EH SOME OF THE RESEARCH SHOWS

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:37.734 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT THE PARENTS SIR

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:39.035 region:rollup2
ARE LOOKING FAVORABLY ON THE

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:41.271 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD.

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:43.140 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT ALL IS CERTAINLY NOT

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:45.275 region:rollup2
ALL PARENTS AT ME WHEN HE WAS

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.110 region:rollup2
THE REASON WOULD RESEARCH IS.

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:49.146 region:rollup2
THAT IS ALL WE HEAR IS THAT

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:50.380 region:rollup2
CRITICISM SITE MAYBE THERE'S

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:51.014 region:rollup2
GOOD STUFF SO YEAH A AND AND I

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.915 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S OF IMPORTANT POINT

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:53.183 region:rollup2
THE ONLY. POLL THAT THAT I'M

01:00:51.915 --> 01:00:54.951 region:rollup2
AWARE OF THAT'S BEEN CONDUCTED

01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:56.486 region:rollup2
ON THIS ISSUE ACTUALLY FOUND

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:57.287 region:rollup2
THAT A MAJORITY PARENTS THOUGHT

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:58.989 region:rollup2
THE DASHBOARD PRESENTED

01:00:57.287 --> 01:01:00.490 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND HELPFUL MANNER.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.758 region:rollup2
IT WAS NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT WE

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.393 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THEIR AREAS

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:04.294 region:rollup2
THAT THERE CAN BE IMPROVEMENT

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:06.796 region:rollup2
BUT A LOT OF THAT INTO

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:08.832 region:rollup2
IMPRESSIONS ARE INTERPRETATIONS

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:09.366 region:rollup2
OF THE DASHBOARD OR HOW. DUMB

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:11.034 region:rollup2
ARE BEING SHAPED BY WHAT

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:12.569 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL ADVOCATE SOMETIMES

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:14.137 region:rollup2
FEEL OR SORT OF YOU HOW

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:15.539 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE REACT TO IT

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:18.275 region:rollup2
WHICH ISN'T ALSO REPRESENT HOW

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:20.577 region:rollup2
OF HOW ALL. SO I I THINK THAT

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:22.312 region:rollup2
THAT THAT POLL FOUND THAT

01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:23.280 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY A YOU KNOW A MAJORITY

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:24.447 region:rollup2
OF PARENTS THOUGHT IT THOUGHT IT

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.715 region:rollup2
WAS PRESENTING INFORMATION AND

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:27.250 region:rollup2
HELPFUL MANNER WHICH DOES NOT

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:29.252 region:rollup2
SAY CAN'T BE IMPROVED COMPLETELY

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:32.322 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH YOU. ON THAT BECAUSE

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:33.123 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER SOMEONE

01:01:32.322 --> 01:01:34.090 region:rollup2
COMING TO IT FRESH

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:34.991 region:rollup2
CAN INTUITIVELY UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.660 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION IS BECAUSE AS

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:39.029 region:rollup2
WE'VE I THINK ALL MENTIONED.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:40.197 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:41.565 region:rollup2
WHAT PEOPLE ARE USED TO WRITE

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:42.766 region:rollup2
PAPER USED TO A SINGLE NUMBER

01:01:41.565 --> 01:01:44.434 region:rollup2
SAID IT'S A PART OF IT IS NO

01:01:42.766 --> 01:01:45.969 region:rollup2
MATTER WHAT YOU DO IS GOING TO

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:47.103 region:rollup2
TAKE AWHILE FOR PEOPLE GET USED

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:48.805 region:rollup2
TO WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY. SERVE

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:50.240 region:rollup2
WHAT MULTIPLE MEASURES ARE AND I

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:51.241 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.044 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE DONE IN TERMS THAT

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:54.678 region:rollup2
THAT IS ACTUALLY UNDER WAY. OF

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:56.112 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT YOU KNOW.

01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:56.613 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU THAT THE FOCUS WAS

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:58.548 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU GET THE RIGHT

01:01:56.613 --> 01:02:00.216 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IN THE WEBSITE I

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.351 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS? CONSISTENT WITH

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:01.952 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VEHEARD FROM OTHER

01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:03.720 region:rollup2
STATES THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:05.755 region:rollup2
SORT OF BIG YOUR DATA SYSTEM

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.090 region:rollup2
REVIEWS AS YOU GOTTA. FIGURE OUT

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:08.525 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT INFORMATION IS AND

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.926 region:rollup2
THEN ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU REALLY

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:12.362 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON THAT USER INTERFACE

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:14.331 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE. ANSWER THAT QUESTION

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:15.365 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE DESIGN SO

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:16.633 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEONE COMING THAT THERE'S

01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:18.001 region:rollup2
TOO MANY WORDS ON THE PAGE

01:02:16.633 --> 01:02:20.070 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE VERY COMMON AREA

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:20.937 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK. IF YOU NEED TO USE

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.772 region:rollup2
WORDS TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:24.240 region:rollup2
SEEING THERE'S THINGS YOU CAN DO

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:25.408 region:rollup2
WITH GRAPHICS AND OTHERWISE THAT

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.110 region:rollup2
MAKE IT MORE INTUITIVE FOR

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:28.612 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COMING TO THE WEBSITE. SO

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:29.813 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S THE WORK AHEAD

01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:30.647 region:rollup2
I'M E. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:32.148 region:rollup2
THERE'S REPOSE ON GOVERNOR'S

01:02:30.647 --> 01:02:33.516 region:rollup2
BUDGET FOR SOME ADDITIONAL

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:34.584 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:36.720 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DASHBOARD.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:37.354 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT BE VERY HELPFUL TO

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.256 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS WORK AND REALLY DO

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:40.256 region:rollup2
YOU. KNOW USER TESTING DESIGN

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:43.193 region:rollup2
WORK.

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:43.827 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE INTO THIS OUR NEXT

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:45.295 region:rollup2
PHASE A VERIFYING THE DASHBOARD

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:47.297 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO FOR.

01:02:45.295 --> 01:02:48.798 region:rollup2
I'M CAN I GET INTO THIS THIS

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:50.900 region:rollup2
WHOLE QUESTION OF.

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:51.534 region:rollup2
AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.036 region:rollup2
FEDERAL TO THE FELLOW GARMENTS

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:55.405 region:rollup2
ASK US TO.

01:02:53.036 --> 01:02:57.240 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY LOS FROM SCHOOLS.

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:59.676 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALLY.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.344 region:rollup2
BUT FOR OUR CITY COUNTY PURSES

01:02:59.676 --> 01:03:02.812 region:rollup2
WE'VE CHOSEN AND IF I DISTRICT

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:04.614 region:rollup2
AS A WHOLE.

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:06.483 region:rollup2
AND I I LOVE IT JUST TO HAVE YOU

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:08.018 region:rollup2
RIFFLE OF IT ON THE ADVANTAGES

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:10.887 region:rollup2
OF OUR APPROACH BUT AT THE SAME

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:11.388 region:rollup2
TIME. POWER RECONCILING THIS

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:11.921 region:rollup2
REQUEST FROM THE FEDERAL

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:14.324 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:16.559 region:rollup2
.

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:18.962 region:rollup2
ON THAT QUESTION.

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:20.030 region:rollup2
SURE SO THAT AS YOU MENTIONED

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:22.098 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:23.333 region:rollup2
FORMULA REQUIRES A DEDICATION OF

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:24.367 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THE EVERY STUDENT

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:26.736 region:rollup2
SUCCEEDS ACTS REQUIRES THE

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:28.772 region:rollup2
IDENTIFICATION OF SCHOOLS. AMENT

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:29.806 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY UNDER ASCI IT'S THE

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:31.307 region:rollup2
IDENTIFICATION OF THE LOWEST

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.876 region:rollup2
PERFORMING FIVE PERCENT OF TITLE

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:34.878 region:rollup2
ONE SCHOOLS.

01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:37.080 region:rollup2
AND SO. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:38.915 region:rollup2
THAT INITIALLY BOTH THE CD AND

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.717 region:rollup2
THE STATE BOARD HAD A DESIRE TO.

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:43.053 region:rollup2
.

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:46.056 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW MAKE OUR IDENTIFICATION

01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:47.791 region:rollup2
PROCESS UNDER LC FF FIT INTO.

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:49.225 region:rollup2
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS

01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:50.727 region:rollup2
REQUIRING UNDER ASSA?

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:52.128 region:rollup2
AFTER SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS

01:03:50.727 --> 01:03:52.729 region:rollup2
WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:54.464 region:rollup2
EDUCATION THERE.

01:03:52.729 --> 01:03:56.032 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:57.567 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF START SHOOTING

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:59.302 region:rollup2
FRANKLY I THINK IT'S FAIR I'M IS

01:03:57.567 --> 01:04:02.172 region:rollup2
THAT NO CALIFORNIA YOU CANNOT

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:03.139 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY. SCHOOLS EXCUSE ME

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.341 region:rollup2
CANNOT IN HIGH DISTRICTS YOU

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:06.443 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GIVE US MISLEAD THE LIST

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:07.377 region:rollup2
OF LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS.

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:09.145 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:09.646 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DEVELOPED A CRITERION

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:11.781 region:rollup2
BASED.

01:04:09.646 --> 01:04:13.149 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:14.351 region:rollup2
OF THE SCHOOLS THAT'S

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:15.385 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED IN THE DRAFT STATE

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.753 region:rollup2
PLANTS OF THE STATE BOARD HAS

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:18.888 region:rollup2
NOT YET APPROVED.

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:19.456 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS ALTHOUGH THE US

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:21.791 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:23.059 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY SIGNED OFF ON IT AND

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:24.327 region:rollup2
THE IDENTIFICATION WILL

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:26.730 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY BEAM.

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:28.131 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU HAVE THE MAJORITY OF

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:30.633 region:rollup2
YOUR INDICATORS ARE RED.

01:04:28.131 --> 01:04:32.569 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR SCHOOL THEN YOU WILL

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:33.436 region:rollup2
BE IDENTIFIED AND THAT SORT OF

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:34.838 region:rollup2
GOES UP FROM THERE WITH

01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:36.306 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CRITERIA BUT IF

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:38.208 region:rollup2
YOU'RE PRIMARILY RED OR WRITE AN

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:40.910 region:rollup2
ORANGE. THEN YOUR SCHOOL WILL BE

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:43.113 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED FOR THEM.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:44.180 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE UNDER. AS YOU KNOW

01:04:43.113 --> 01:04:47.517 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST ONE SCHOOL IN THE

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:48.184 region:rollup2
LA A.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:48.718 region:rollup2
CAN A CUDGEL BEEN HERE THOUGH I

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:50.587 region:rollup2
THINK I THINK THE REASON

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:51.221 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAD THAT APPROACH

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:51.888 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:54.290 region:rollup2
THAT AND IF I LOWEST PERFORMING

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:55.925 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS. IS THE CAPACITY TO HELP

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:57.460 region:rollup2
THOSE SCHOOLS SUCCEED HAS TO

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:59.396 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.497 region:rollup2
BECAUSE UNDER THE OLD NCLB AND I

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.498 region:rollup2
LIVE THIS YOU HAD A CONSULTANT

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:03.399 region:rollup2
FROM THE OUTSIDE COMING YEAR

01:05:01.498 --> 01:05:04.367 region:rollup2
SCHOOL NOT IN YOUR DISTRICT

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:05.201 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:06.636 region:rollup2
YEAH THEY WERE THERE FOR THREE

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:07.237 region:rollup2
YEARS INTO YOU LIFTED YOU KNOW

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:09.773 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR SCORES UP AND THEN

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:11.608 region:rollup2
THEY LEFT AND THE CAPACITY.

01:05:09.773 --> 01:05:13.476 region:rollup2
TO KEEP THAT GOING DID NOT

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:14.644 region:rollup2
REMAIN AND I THINK THAT THE IDEA

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:16.946 region:rollup2
HERE IS THAT THIS EXPERTISE HAS

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:18.381 region:rollup2
TO BE DEVELOPED.

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:19.349 region:rollup2
BUT THE DISTRICT LEVEL LIMIT

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:21.184 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T IDENTIFY

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:22.318 region:rollup2
LOW BLOWS FOR SCHOOLS WITH A

01:05:21.184 --> 01:05:22.986 region:rollup2
GREAT QUESTION TO THEM BECAUSE

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:23.553 region:rollup2
LET ME OUT SO LET ME ASK ABOUT

01:05:22.986 --> 01:05:24.788 region:rollup2
THIS I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:26.823 region:rollup2
HEARING FROM THE AND THE FOLKS

01:05:24.788 --> 01:05:27.924 region:rollup2
FROM THE CONSORTIUM IN A LITTLE

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:29.259 region:rollup2
BIT. BY.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:32.028 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE INTERESTING

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:33.163 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW THAT

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.830 region:rollup2
COMES DOWN TO WHETHER.

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:36.266 region:rollup2
IT THE EXTENT TO WHICH DISTRICTS

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:36.900 region:rollup2
GET TO ASK.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.635 region:rollup2
YOU'LL GET THE BASIC CHOOSE YOU

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:40.770 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THEM WITH SUPPORT SO I

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:42.505 region:rollup2
THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:44.007 region:rollup2
AND REQUIRES A SIX OR PER THEIR

01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:45.041 region:rollup2
COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION FOR

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:47.544 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:49.779 region:rollup2
BUT WE CREATED THIS

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:51.548 region:rollup2
SEE SEE TO. ASSIST WITH JUST

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:53.450 region:rollup2
THOSE KIND OF SITUATIONS I

01:05:51.548 --> 01:05:54.784 region:rollup2
THOUGHT SO WHAT WHERE WE.

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:58.087 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE STORY

01:05:54.784 --> 01:06:00.023 region:rollup2
HERE IN TERMS OF FUN WHEN?

01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:01.724 region:rollup2
QUESTION SO I I THINK WE WOULD

01:06:00.023 --> 01:06:03.393 region:rollup2
DEFERRED OF THE THIRD PANEL

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:04.527 region:rollup2
WHICH IS FOR A. LEGISLATING

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:05.728 region:rollup2
ALICE OFFICE AND PARTNER FINANCE

01:06:04.527 --> 01:06:07.163 region:rollup2
ON THEIR OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:08.865 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IF THAT'S

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:10.800 region:rollup2
OKAY JUST BECAUSE I I KNOW THAT

01:06:08.865 --> 01:06:11.334 region:rollup2
THEY HAD THAT DEL WEEK THEY'LL

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.901 region:rollup2
BE COVERING THAT BUT BUT I

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.369 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:15.238 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO THE ISSUE OF

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:18.408 region:rollup2
SCHOOL IDENTIFICATION HOUSE IT

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:19.375 region:rollup2
FIT WITHIN A DISH AND UP YOU

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:19.976 region:rollup2
KNOW. LOOKING TROUGH ANY FORMULA

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:21.377 region:rollup2
FOCUSES ON LOCAL EDUCATIONAL

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.879 region:rollup2
AGENCY AS THE LOCUS OF

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:23.847 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPROVING

01:06:22.879 --> 01:06:26.115 region:rollup2
CLASSROOMS I THINK.

01:06:23.847 --> 01:06:28.051 region:rollup2
TOOK TO THAT POINT THAT'S TRUE

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:31.454 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S NOTHING INCONSISTENT

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:32.055 region:rollup2
WITH THAT ELLIOTT FOCUS TO SAY.

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:33.289 region:rollup2
DISTRICT YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:34.324 region:rollup2
SCHOOL IS REALLY STRUGGLING

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:34.924 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT BE AT THE

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.426 region:rollup2
MOMENT OR AT LEAST WE'RE GONNA

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:37.994 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT IS PART OF THE

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:39.662 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION IN DEVELOPING YOUR

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.030 region:rollup2
LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. YOU

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:42.799 region:rollup2
ARE PAYING ATTENTION IF THE

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:44.234 region:rollup2
SCHOOL THAT MAYBE YOUR OTHERWISE

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:45.368 region:rollup2
HIGH FLYING DISTRICT BUT THERE'S

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:46.836 region:rollup2
A SCHOOL THAT STRUGGLING.

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:48.505 region:rollup2
I'M SO SO WE BELIEVE I I THINK

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:50.473 region:rollup2
THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:52.942 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE THESE CHANGES IN THE

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:53.743 region:rollup2
IN THE FEDERAL PLAN. WITH THE WE

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:55.311 region:rollup2
DO NOT LEAVE THIS IS

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:57.080 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY INCONSISTENT WITH

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:58.414 region:rollup2
LCF AFTER AN ANYWAY BECAUSE THIS

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.415 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT DISTRICTS

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.683 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DOING WE EXPECT

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:02.151 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS TO BE LOOKING AT THEIR

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:03.486 region:rollup2
SCHOOL LEVEL DATA. AND

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:04.654 region:rollup2
RESPONDING APPROPRIATELY WITHIN

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:05.555 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN

01:07:04.654 --> 01:07:06.789 region:rollup2
PROCESS

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:07.891 region:rollup2
IT'S A WE THINK THERE'S A WAY TO

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:09.959 region:rollup2
GO ABOUT ADDRESSING THE SCHOOL

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:11.995 region:rollup2
IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:13.730 region:rollup2
UNDER ESTA UNDER THAT APPROACH

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:15.431 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR. BECAUSE ASSN

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:16.900 region:rollup2
ITSELF GIVES LEAD UP TO THE

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:18.167 region:rollup2
STATE'S TO REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.135 region:rollup2
DO WE DO THAT SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:20.436 region:rollup2
PROCESS

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:21.871 region:rollup2
SO THIS STATE WE CAN CHOOSE TO

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:25.141 region:rollup2
BAKE IT MAKE IT VERY MUCH A

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:26.943 region:rollup2
DISTRICT FOCUSED PROCESS I'M.

SIGNIFICANTLY ON.

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.875 region:rollup2
AND THE CENTERS WERE GIVING

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:21.277 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS IN THE SENATE TO IMPROVE

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:24.347 region:rollup2
STUDENT PERFORMANCE.

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:25.548 region:rollup2
DE DO YOU.

01:11:24.347 --> 01:11:29.719 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT'S IT WHAT'S YOUR TAKE

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:30.920 region:rollup2
ON THAT ISSUE?

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:32.889 region:rollup2
I I GUESS I WOULD SAY THERE ARE

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.223 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF FACTUAL ERRORS IN

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:35.725 region:rollup2
THEIR ANALYSIS THAT THAT WE END

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:37.460 region:rollup2
UP RESPONDING TO THEIR TO MAKE

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:38.961 region:rollup2
CORRECTIONS TO THEIR REPORT

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:41.330 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEY

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:43.099 region:rollup2
MISS READ OR. OVERLOOKED CERTAIN

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:45.101 region:rollup2
PARTS OF INCLUDING THE PLAN SO I

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:47.303 region:rollup2
I THINK JUST IN TERMS OF.

01:11:45.101 --> 01:11:48.371 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT IS A. THAT THE

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:49.672 region:rollup2
QUALITY AND RIGOR OF THEIR

01:11:48.371 --> 01:11:50.740 region:rollup2
INTERVIEW PROCESS THEY WERE

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:52.108 region:rollup2
WORKING THIS IS YOU KNOW

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.909 region:rollup2
EVERYONE HAS TO TURN THIS AROUND

01:11:52.108 --> 01:11:54.076 region:rollup2
REALLY QUICK BECAUSE OF THE TIME

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:55.211 region:rollup2
LINES AND REVIEWING PLANS IN

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:56.813 region:rollup2
THESE ARE HUNDRED TWENTY SOME

01:11:55.211 --> 01:11:58.314 region:rollup2
PAGE DOCUMENTS. SO I THINK WHAT

01:11:56.813 --> 01:12:00.416 region:rollup2
WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:02.185 region:rollup2
CONCLUSIONS FROM A RESEARCH AND

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:02.652 region:rollup2
LINGER PERSPECTIVE IN MANY

01:12:02.185 --> 01:12:03.786 region:rollup2
RESPECTS. BUT I THINK

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:05.555 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY WE DISAGREE WITH

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:07.290 region:rollup2
THEIR CONCLUSION WHICH IS THEIR

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:09.058 region:rollup2
VIEW THAT THE ONLY WAY TO TAKE

01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:10.593 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT IS

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:12.695 region:rollup2
TO GO BACK TO THE APPROACH TO

01:12:10.593 --> 01:12:13.729 region:rollup2
SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT UNDER NCLB

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:14.363 region:rollup2
THAT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:15.531 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS REALLY THE LANDS

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:17.333 region:rollup2
AND FRAME THEY WERE BRINGING TO

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:18.734 region:rollup2
IT WE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:20.736 region:rollup2
ENGAGE WITH THE STAFF FROM THEM

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:21.170 region:rollup2
HE WORKED ON IT AND THAT BECAME

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:22.138 region:rollup2
QUITE CLEAR IN THOSE

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.139 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS.

01:12:22.138 --> 01:12:25.107 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THEY JUST HAD US OR

01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:26.642 region:rollup2
PRE PRECONCEIVED NOTION OF WHAT

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:29.178 region:rollup2
THEY BELIEVE A GOOD PLAN LOOKED

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:31.781 region:rollup2
LIKE. IN CALIFORNIA'S INNOVATING

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:32.949 region:rollup2
ARM AS CHAIR TALENTED DISCS THE

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:33.816 region:rollup2
WERE THERE COUNTRIES WATCHING

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:36.219 region:rollup2
WHAT CALIFORNIA'S DOING BECAUSE

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:36.552 region:rollup2
IT IS. A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:38.054 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT.

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:39.555 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT SORT OF OUR

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:41.324 region:rollup2
OVERALL RESPONSE WOULD BE THAT

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:42.859 region:rollup2
IF IT'S A.

01:12:41.324 --> 01:12:44.961 region:rollup2
IT'S A LITTLE IRONIC FOR PEOPLE

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:47.797 region:rollup2
WHO WORK IN I THINK WERE ALRIGHT

01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:49.565 region:rollup2
WE FOCUS. ON THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP

01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:51.200 region:rollup2
IN THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST.

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:53.369 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S HAVE PERSISTED FOR

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.037 region:rollup2
THE LAST TWO DECADES UNDER THE

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.706 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAT BERMAN CRITICIZED

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:58.074 region:rollup2
FOR NOT GOING BACK TO YOU. SO I

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:59.175 region:rollup2
THINK WE WOULD PREFER TO YOU

01:12:58.074 --> 01:13:01.010 region:rollup2
KNOW TAKE THE TEN THAT WERE

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:02.345 region:rollup2
ASKING DISTRICTS AND TEACHERS

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:04.247 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING

01:13:02.345 --> 01:13:05.381 region:rollup2
ISN'T WORKING FOR STUDENTS.

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:06.015 region:rollup2
TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.683 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:10.219 region:rollup2
WOULD I THINK. YOU'D RATHER

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:11.487 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE THEN DEMONIZED.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:13.189 region:rollup2
CAN THE DEMONIZING PATH DID NOT

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:14.223 region:rollup2
WORK WE SAW THAT RIGHT FOR HOW

01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:16.092 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS THAT'S THE QUESTION

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:20.296 region:rollup2
HOW BUT HOW MUCH ARE WE SENATE

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:21.898 region:rollup2
RISING EFFECTIVELY.

01:13:20.296 --> 01:13:23.900 region:rollup2
WELL AS I I THINK WE CAN WE CAN

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:25.001 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT AT SOME DATA POINTS

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.736 region:rollup2
THAT SHOW THAT WERE ON THE RIGHT

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:28.104 region:rollup2
TRACK WE SEEM THERE'S CLEARLY A

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:29.405 region:rollup2
LOT OF WORK TO DO IF YOU LOOK AT

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:30.306 region:rollup2
THE ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND I

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.274 region:rollup2
THINK IT WE EVERYONE WOULD

01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:33.376 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S. A LOT

01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:35.845 region:rollup2
OF WORK TO DO THERE TO IMPROVE.

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:36.445 region:rollup2
YET TO SUPPORT THAT TEACHERS IN

01:13:35.845 --> 01:13:38.180 region:rollup2
CLASSROOMS HOW THEY'RE LIVING

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:39.382 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION. BUT YOU KNOW YOU

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.449 region:rollup2
CAN LOOK AT GRADUATION RATES THE

01:13:39.382 --> 01:13:41.918 region:rollup2
HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN IT'S

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:43.786 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NARROWING GAPS IN

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:45.121 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATES HISTORICALLY WE

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:46.355 region:rollup2
HAVE THE HIGHEST. NUMBER OF

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:48.891 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ARE GRADUATING

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:50.226 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR UC AND CSU.

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:51.794 region:rollup2
.

01:13:50.226 --> 01:13:53.296 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION RATE IS GOING DOWN

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:54.263 region:rollup2
THERE IS A RECENT STUDY RELEASED

01:13:53.296 --> 01:13:55.665 region:rollup2
BY THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:56.866 region:rollup2
THAT SHOW THAT ACTUALLY THE

01:13:55.665 --> 01:13:59.268 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL INVESTMENTS THE

01:13:56.866 --> 01:14:00.303 region:rollup2
FUNDS. TO DISTRICTS UNDER LCF

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:01.971 region:rollup2
AFTER THE SUPPLEMENTAL

01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:02.805 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION GRANTS YOU

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:05.508 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SING GREATER

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:07.009 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT ON MATH SCORES. IN

01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:08.177 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATES AT DISTRICTS

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:09.612 region:rollup2
ARE GETTING MORE OF THEIR STUFF

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:11.013 region:rollup2
ON ON CONCENTRATION DOLLARS SO

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:12.481 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME EARLY EVIDENCE IS

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:13.049 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY NOT CONCLUSIVE. I

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:15.418 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S WHY THERE'S A

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:17.987 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT TO REALLY KEEP AN EYE

01:14:15.418 --> 01:14:19.588 region:rollup2
ON THIS AND LISTEN. TO DISTRICTS

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:21.324 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHERS ABOUT

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:22.291 region:rollup2
WHAT'S WORKING WHAT ISN'T AND

01:14:21.324 --> 01:14:23.826 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAN IMPROVE IT.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.161 region:rollup2
BUT TO SORT OF I THINK WE DO

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:27.096 region:rollup2
HAVE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT WE

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:27.763 region:rollup2
ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK IT'S

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:30.599 region:rollup2
EARLY OTHERS BUT WITH US IN THAT

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:32.802 region:rollup2
WE CAN BUILD ON.

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:34.503 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND JUST JUST TO TRY

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:36.906 region:rollup2
DIDN'T WANNA MAKE SURE THAT.

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:38.140 region:rollup2
THAT CHAIR ALAN THAT YOU KNOW IN

01:14:36.906 --> 01:14:38.774 region:rollup2
A STUDENT ISN'T SHOWING TESTING

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.409 region:rollup2
DAY THAT THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THE

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:44.647 region:rollup2
TEST ANOTHER DAY. IS NOT ONLY

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:45.881 region:rollup2
GIVEN ONE DAY SO THAT. THERE'S

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:47.984 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER PLACES WHERE I WAS.

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:49.018 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT SO

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:50.486 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS SHAUNA MONEY

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:51.387 region:rollup2
THERE'S TESTING ON MONDAY.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.421 region:rollup2
SCHOOL GUY CAPTURE THEM AT SOME

01:14:51.387 --> 01:14:54.457 region:rollup2
POINT AND GIVE THEM THE TEST SO

01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:55.992 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST A YOU ARE HERE

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:57.059 region:rollup2
THAT DAY IT INTO JUST NOT OF

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:58.561 region:rollup2
PARENTS SIGNED A WAIVER. WHICH

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:59.228 region:rollup2
IN MY EXPERIENCE.

01:14:58.561 --> 01:14:59.829 region:rollup2
PARENTS WERE SIGNING WAIVERS ARE

01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:00.429 region:rollup2
MORE ENGAGED AND THOSE WHO ARE

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:01.697 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:02.665 region:rollup2
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY THEN

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:04.033 region:rollup2
THEY WOULDN'T TAKE THE TEST SO

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:05.301 region:rollup2
THERE'S WAIVERS AND THERE'S JUST

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:06.335 region:rollup2
MISSING THE TASK OF TWO

01:15:05.301 --> 01:15:08.537 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS I WOULD SAY.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:10.306 region:rollup2
AND THEN ON THE ON ON ON

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:11.941 region:rollup2
SUBMITTING THE APPLICATION TO

01:15:10.306 --> 01:15:12.575 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT'S.

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:13.876 region:rollup2
THEN IT GOES BEFORE THE BOARD ON

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:15.444 region:rollup2
THE TWELFTH.

01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:16.045 region:rollup2
AND YOU EXPECT TO BE BLESSED BY

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:17.046 region:rollup2
THE BOARD AND THEN IT WOULD BE

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:17.346 region:rollup2
MAILED OFF.

01:15:17.046 --> 01:15:19.815 region:rollup2
TO.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:21.417 region:rollup2
US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.617 region:rollup2
PARTNERS EDUCATION.

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:24.120 region:rollup2
AND.

01:15:21.617 --> 01:15:25.888 region:rollup2
AND DO YOU HAVE A TIME LINE

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.123 region:rollup2
FOR WHEN YOU WOULD HEAR. WHETHER

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:28.591 region:rollup2
IT SAY DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:30.393 region:rollup2
TIMELINE WHERE WERE PASSED AT

01:15:28.591 --> 01:15:31.394 region:rollup2
THE TIME THAT THE US DEPARTMENT

01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:33.996 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION HAS TO FORMALLY

01:15:31.394 --> 01:15:35.097 region:rollup2
REVIEW AND ACT ON OUR PLAN BUT.

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:36.532 region:rollup2
BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:38.734 region:rollup2
THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:40.302 region:rollup2
AM I THINK NOT NAIVELY SO BUT

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:42.438 region:rollup2
OPTIMISTIC THAT OUR PLAN WILL BE

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:45.274 region:rollup2
APPROVED SHORTLY AFTER WE TURNED

01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:47.343 region:rollup2
IT IN. A MONTH.

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:49.445 region:rollup2
SIX WEEKS THINK THAT SOMEWHERE

01:15:47.343 --> 01:15:52.081 region:rollup2
IN THE STONE JUST. RIGHT.

01:15:49.445 --> 01:15:53.549 region:rollup2
PROBABLY BEFORE SUMMER FISH.

01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:55.451 region:rollup2
ARE YOU REALLYHOPE THEY COME

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.619 region:rollup2
ABOUT DOCTOR WEBER.

01:15:55.451 --> 01:15:57.586 region:rollup2
SORRY I WAS LATE AND I'M IN.

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:58.621 region:rollup2
TOO MANY MEETINGS AND PROBABLY

01:15:57.586 --> 01:16:00.990 region:rollup2
AND ONE RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND

01:15:58.621 --> 01:16:02.892 region:rollup2
FROM MY STAFF BUT.

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:04.760 region:rollup2
WANTED ASKS. YOU KNOW THE

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:07.229 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD IS IS AS POINTED OUT

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.230 region:rollup2
BY. A SENATOR HERE THAT HAS HAS

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.932 region:rollup2
BEEN A REALLY.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:11.901 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT THING TO MANAGE IN

01:16:09.932 --> 01:16:14.203 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE AVERAGE PARENTS I

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:17.006 region:rollup2
MEAN I I THINK THE DATA. THAT WE

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:18.974 region:rollup2
GET FROM THE DASHBOARD IS GREAT

01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:20.376 region:rollup2
FOR SCHOOLS BECAUSE SCHOOLS NOT

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:21.844 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH DATA AND SO THIS IS

01:16:20.376 --> 01:16:23.712 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THEY'VE HAD ALL ALONG

01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:25.147 region:rollup2
BUT. BEING ABLE TO EAT BASICALLY

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:26.982 region:rollup2
PUT IN THE PUBLIC FOR THE PUBLIC

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:27.283 region:rollup2
TO CONSUME IT HAS BEEN A

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:29.218 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE.

01:16:27.283 --> 01:16:30.419 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:32.655 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CONSISTENTLY ASKING ABOUT

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:33.656 region:rollup2
AND I AND I SOON ASSUME IT'S HIT

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:35.124 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE BECAUSE THEY MAKE

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:36.926 region:rollup2
REFERENCE TO IT IN YOUR REPORT.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:39.328 region:rollup2
IS A COMPARATIVE DATA. YOU KNOW

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:41.130 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY WANT

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:42.031 region:rollup2
TO KNOW HOW DOES THIS SCHOOL

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:42.565 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO ONE ACROSS THE

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:44.467 region:rollup2
STREET.

01:16:42.565 --> 01:16:46.802 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT BE AS

01:16:44.467 --> 01:16:48.838 region:rollup2
SOPHISTICATED AS AS THOSE WHO

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:50.105 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL ACCESS TO THIS AND CAN

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:51.974 region:rollup2
MANIPULATE THINGS THEY WANT TO

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:53.242 region:rollup2
KNOW. IF I PUT MY KID ON THIS

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:55.177 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THE STREET WHAT WILL BE

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:56.779 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOME SOURCES ON THE OTHER

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:58.481 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THE STREET. SO. ARE WE

01:16:56.779 --> 01:17:01.083 region:rollup2
PLANNING TO MAKE THAT KIND OF

01:16:58.481 --> 01:17:02.818 region:rollup2
COMPARATIVE DATA. A EASIER TO

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:06.789 region:rollup2
ACCESS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SEE

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:07.957 region:rollup2
IT'S HE IT SOMEWHERE ON WOULD OF

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:08.624 region:rollup2
FIVE BY FIVE OR SOME KIND OF A.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:09.825 region:rollup2
IS THAT TO BE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:11.360 region:rollup2
DO IN IN THE IN THE DASHBOARD OF

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.927 region:rollup2
THE PARENTS

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:19.135 region:rollup2
SEEM TO LIKE EVEN INDICATORS

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:20.970 region:rollup2
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:24.974 region:rollup2
THE AVERAGE CREATE IS A REAL

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:27.142 region:rollup2
SIMPLE LIFE THEY WANT TO KNOW

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:29.211 region:rollup2
WHERE MY SCHOOLS FAN IN

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:31.347 region:rollup2
COMPARISON TO OTHER SCHOOLS IN

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:34.850 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT I MEAN. YEAH. AND

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:36.318 region:rollup2
MAYBE EVEN WANT TO KNOW NOT JUST

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:39.522 region:rollup2
HOW DO I COMPARE TO THE SAME

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:40.022 region:rollup2
SOCIAL ECONOMIC BECAUSE MOST OF

01:17:39.522 --> 01:17:41.891 region:rollup2
THEM WANT TO GET ABOVE A

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:43.425 region:rollup2
SOCIOECONOMIC. SO THE QUESTION

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:47.429 region:rollup2
IS ARE WE MAKING IT EASIER TO

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:48.631 region:rollup2
ACCESS THAT KIND OF INFORMATION

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:51.901 region:rollup2
ON THE DASHBOARD.

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:56.705 region:rollup2
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR ANSWERING

01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:59.008 region:rollup2
THAT WAY THAT'S OKAY. FINE I'M

01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:59.942 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WHERE THIS IS.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:00.509 region:rollup2
BACK BUT BUT YES WE ARE

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:01.477 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:03.212 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WAS MADE

01:18:01.477 --> 01:18:05.014 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL FIELD TEST

01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:06.148 region:rollup2
OF THE DASHBOARD. I'M VERSUS THE

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:07.449 region:rollup2
FALL RELEASE THE DASHBOARD IS

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:11.053 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOW A REPORT. THAT IS

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:16.258 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY DISTRICT I'VE ITS OF

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:17.059 region:rollup2
ITS ON THE MAIN LANDING PAGES

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:17.860 region:rollup2
ONE. CLERIC

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:18.994 region:rollup2
TO GO TO BE ABLE TO SEE EVERY

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.095 region:rollup2
SCHOOL IN THE DISTRICT.

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:20.729 region:rollup2
WHAT COLOR THEY ARE ON ALL THE

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.297 region:rollup2
INDICATORS RIGHT TOGETHER IN ONE

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.164 region:rollup2
PLACE

01:18:21.297 --> 01:18:23.866 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE AND

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:24.366 region:rollup2
COMPARE THAT DATA WE'VE GOT

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:25.067 region:rollup2
REQUESTS TO DO SOMETHING

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.001 region:rollup2
SIMILAR?

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:26.602 region:rollup2
AT THE COUNTY LEVEL SO YOU CAN

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:30.239 region:rollup2
LOOK AT ALL THE EXPECT BETWEEN

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:32.007 region:rollup2
NOW AND THE NEXT

01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:33.442 region:rollup2
ASH BOARD RELEASED IN THE FALL.

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:34.143 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S PART OF ALSO OF WHAT

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:35.811 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A PART OF THAT IS

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:37.613 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT LAY OUT THAT IS

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:40.082 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN. WHICH IS MORE LIKE

01:18:37.613 --> 01:18:42.885 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE A ROW WITH NO TEST

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:44.553 region:rollup2
SCORES FOR. ALL THE SCHOOLS

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.487 region:rollup2
THINKING LIKE SORT IT WHETHER

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.522 region:rollup2
THAT APPROACH WORKS IF THERE'S

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:49.692 region:rollup2
ANOTHER APPROACH THAT WOULD BE

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:51.894 region:rollup2
EASIER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:53.462 region:rollup2
FOR PARENTS AND OTHER USERS NOW

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:54.797 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY THE WHAT

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:56.332 region:rollup2
THE LOWEST FIVE PERCENT OF WHAT

01:18:54.797 --> 01:18:59.168 region:rollup2
IS IT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS

01:18:56.332 --> 01:19:00.336 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO ON THE. DASHBOARD.

01:18:59.168 --> 01:19:01.804 region:rollup2
THAT GOAL BLESSED.

01:19:00.336 --> 01:19:03.339 region:rollup2
PENDING THE APPROVAL OF THE

01:19:01.804 --> 01:19:05.641 region:rollup2
BOARD WILL BE GENERATED IN THE

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:07.676 region:rollup2
FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO

01:19:05.641 --> 01:19:10.312 region:rollup2
THAT THE LESS HAS NOT YET BEEN

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:10.879 region:rollup2
CREATIVELY WOULD BE VISIBLE ON

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:13.082 region:rollup2
THE DASHBOARD FOR PARENTS TO

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:14.984 region:rollup2
SAY.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:19.321 region:rollup2
YES THAT DECISION HAS NOT YET IS

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:20.189 region:rollup2
NOT IN THE INFORMATIONAL BE

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:21.090 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE OKAY.

01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:23.058 region:rollup2
I KNOW WE'VE INCREASED OUR

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:23.592 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATE MED DATA IS

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:25.027 region:rollup2
THERE ALL DO WE HAVE ANY

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:25.628 region:rollup2
QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS A

01:19:25.027 --> 01:19:26.362 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION OF WHAT THAT REALLY

01:19:25.628 --> 01:19:27.796 region:rollup2
MEANS.

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:28.631 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I I GET

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:29.365 region:rollup2
MEETINGS FROM MY COMMUNITY

01:19:28.631 --> 01:19:30.466 region:rollup2
COLLEGE FOLKS STILL TELL ME

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:31.433 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE HIGH INCREASING

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:32.801 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATE. THE THE

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.836 region:rollup2
REMEDIAL DATA THAT IS STILL IN

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:34.403 region:rollup2
THE SEVENTY EIGHTY PERCENT OF

01:19:33.836 --> 01:19:34.803 region:rollup2
SOME COMMUTING CALLED JUST.

01:19:34.403 --> 01:19:36.505 region:rollup2
SO.

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:38.140 region:rollup2
IN THEIR MIND SOMETIMES

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:39.074 region:rollup2
GRADUATION ONLY MEANS YOU'VE.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.142 region:rollup2
STUFF BUT IT DOESN'T INDICATE

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:40.776 region:rollup2
ANYTHING QUALITY I HAVE WE DONE

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:43.379 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT INDICATE.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.979 region:rollup2
THAT. THE GRADUATION INCREASING

01:19:43.379 --> 01:19:45.381 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATE OR THE ACT OF

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:46.215 region:rollup2
UP.

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:48.751 region:rollup2
THE ATTAINING OF A HIGH SCHOOL

01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:50.486 region:rollup2
DIPLOMA REALLY TRANSCENDS INTO

01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:52.121 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF ACADEMIC.

01:19:50.486 --> 01:19:54.223 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHMENTS MORE THAN

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:56.225 region:rollup2
ATTENDANCE ACCOMPLISHMENT.

01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:57.693 region:rollup2
SO I YES.

01:19:56.225 --> 01:19:58.861 region:rollup2
IT AND I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA

01:19:57.693 --> 01:20:00.496 region:rollup2
LED THE WAY NATIONALLY IN THIS

01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:01.730 region:rollup2
REGARD WHICH IS DEVELOPING A

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:03.632 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CAREER INDICATOR.

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:05.134 region:rollup2
WHICH WERE ACTUALLY GETTING THE

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:06.402 region:rollup2
SECOND YEAR OF DATA WILL BE

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:08.837 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE THIS FALL SO ACTUAL BE

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:10.539 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PRODUCE A COLOR. ON THE

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:12.675 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD TO SEE HOW YOU DOING.

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:13.776 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR COMPARED TO LAST YEAR

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:16.278 region:rollup2
IN THAT LOOKS AT THINGS YOU KNOW

01:20:13.776 --> 01:20:17.079 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS HE SAID A DIPLOMACY

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:18.947 region:rollup2
WHICH JUST SHOWS YOU MEMBERS

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:20.049 region:rollup2
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. BUT THIS

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:22.384 region:rollup2
IS LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT

01:20:20.049 --> 01:20:23.686 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THAT STUDENTS

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:25.287 region:rollup2
BASICALLY HAD.

01:20:23.686 --> 01:20:26.588 region:rollup2
THROUGH THEIR HIGH SCHOOL

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:28.490 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN IS THE RANGE OF

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:30.492 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES CAREER BASED AND

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:31.560 region:rollup2
COLLEGE PREPARATION BASE SO IT'S

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:33.062 region:rollup2
NOT AN INDIVIDUAL ON SENATE IS

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:35.097 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT MEASURE.

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:36.865 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S LOOKING AT AT SCHOOL OR

01:20:35.097 --> 01:20:38.033 region:rollup2
DISTRICT LEVEL WHERE THE RANGE

01:20:36.865 --> 01:20:38.901 region:rollup2
OF PROGRAMS AND RICH OFFERINGS

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:40.536 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE TO PREPARE

01:20:38.901 --> 01:20:41.403 region:rollup2
STUDENTS FOR SUCCESS WHEN THEY

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:42.871 region:rollup2
GRADUATE.

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:43.972 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A IT'S MORE ROBUST

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:45.274 region:rollup2
MEASURE WE BELIEVE.

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:46.675 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE'S ADDITIONAL

01:20:45.274 --> 01:20:48.577 region:rollup2
DATA THAT'S GONNA BE

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:50.646 region:rollup2
INCORPORATED INTO IT TO BUILD

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:52.614 region:rollup2
OUT THE CAREER MEASURES WHICH AT

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:54.616 region:rollup2
THIS POINT ARE A LITTLE LIMITED.

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:56.085 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT IT IT GETS NOT NOT

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:56.852 region:rollup2
AND NOT THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT

01:20:56.085 --> 01:20:59.054 region:rollup2
LEVEL BUT IN TERMS OF.

01:20:56.852 --> 01:21:00.422 region:rollup2
PROGRAM EVALUATION THINKING

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:02.257 region:rollup2
ABOUT OF ON THE DISTRICT LEADER.

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:03.792 region:rollup2
ARE MY HIGH SCHOOL STRUCTURE TO

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:04.993 region:rollup2
PREPARE STUDENTS FOR SUCCESS TO

PURSUE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:07.830 region:rollup2
THEY WANT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:09.998 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS A REALLY VALUABLE

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:10.966 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S. LASSEN TO LOOKING

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:11.600 region:rollup2
ANALYZE.

01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:13.235 region:rollup2
CROSS THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.269 region:rollup2
STUDENTS CAN. DEMONSTRATE THAT

01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:16.505 region:rollup2
THEY'RE READY FOR SUCCESS

01:21:14.269 --> 01:21:18.173 region:rollup2
HOW MANY WHICH ONES ARE STUDENTS

AT THIS SCHOOL. DEMONSTRATING

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:20.476 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO OTHER SCHOOLS AND

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:21.543 region:rollup2
WHAT TYPES OF OFFERINGS MIGHT WE

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:25.614 region:rollup2
WANT TO BUILD UP THE SCHOOL TO

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:27.282 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT UP.

.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:59.614 region:rollup2
SO OUR STUDENTS HAVE

01:26:57.446 --> 01:27:01.149 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY BEEN PERFORMING.

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:01.717 region:rollup2
THAT LOW LEVELS ON E. L. EN

01:27:10.692 --> 01:27:13.628 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST. IT'S JUST DROWNED TO

01:27:12.094 --> 01:27:15.063 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE NEED TO IMPROVE SO

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:16.832 region:rollup2
IN THE SPRING OF LAST YEAR WE

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:18.600 region:rollup2
BET BEGAN TO STRATEGIZE HOW WE

01:27:16.832 --> 01:27:19.868 region:rollup2
CAN HELP OUR STUDENTS ACADEMIC

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.336 region:rollup2
POOR PERFORMANCE.

01:27:19.868 --> 01:27:23.071 region:rollup2
WE BEGAN TO WORK A PROFESSIONAL

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:24.940 region:rollup2
LEARNING COMMUNITIES.

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:27.175 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TREE CONSULTANTS.

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:28.510 region:rollup2
AS OUR CAPACITY IN PLC'S GREW

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:30.278 region:rollup2
WE MADE A DISTRICT COMMITMENT

01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:32.948 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR TO HONOR COLLABORATION

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:34.850 region:rollup2

THE OUTCOMES THAT WE DECIDED ARE

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:42.157 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR OUR STUDENTS.

01:27:40.856 --> 01:27:43.825 region:rollup2
SO DURING THESE GRADE LEVEL

01:27:42.157 --> 01:27:45.193 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE MEETINGS WE ALSO

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:46.428 region:rollup2

PROTOCOLS FOR MOVING FORWARD.

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.831 region:rollup2
SO THIS PROCESS WORKED WELL FOR

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:24.232 region:rollup2

PARTICULAR DISTRICTS WERE FAIRLY

01:28:29.538 --> 01:28:32.707 region:rollup2
NEW ADMINISTRATIVE TEAMS AND

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:33.975 region:rollup2
THEY BENEFIT FROM.

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:36.478 region:rollup2
THE SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUND

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:38.079 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ITSELF EVALUATION.

01:28:36.478 --> 01:28:39.047 region:rollup2
MY DISTRICT THERMAL ITO HAD

01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:40.482 region:rollup2
ALREADY WORKED THROUGH MUCH OF

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:42.350 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:44.019 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE SELF EVALUATION AND

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:46.021 region:rollup2
ALREADY IMPLEMENTED INITIATIVES

CONNECTEDNESS.

01:28:48.924 --> 01:28:51.459 region:rollup2

ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.236 region:rollup2

AND WE NEEDED SOMETIME IN A BIT

01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:05.907 region:rollup2

DIDN'T HAVE TO BE.

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:11.379 region:rollup2
CONFORMED INTO A ROUND PEG INTO

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:12.514 region:rollup2
A SQUARE HOLE MINUTE THAT'S THE

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:13.915 region:rollup2
BEAUTY PART OF THIS

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:15.951 region:rollup2

PUNITIVE AT ALL.

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:27.629 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE IT PERHAPS IT'S

01:29:26.962 --> 01:29:28.864 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ALL REALLY KNOW EACH

01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:30.198 region:rollup2

01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:38.953 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMPONENTS

01:37:37.151 --> 01:37:40.922 region:rollup2
OF THE DASHBOARD. AND HOW THE

01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:43.458 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD CAN'T SUPPORT THEM TO

01:37:40.922 --> 01:37:43.991 region:rollup2
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT AREAS WHERE

01:37:43.458 --> 01:37:45.093 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:46.561 region:rollup2
GROWTH.

01:37:45.093 --> 01:37:47.729 region:rollup2
ONE THING WE HAVE TO EMPHASIZE

01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:49.197 region:rollup2
STRONGLY IN ALL OF OUR

01:37:47.729 --> 01:37:51.332 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS.

01:37:49.197 --> 01:37:54.168 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE DASHBOARD DISPLAYS

01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:56.070 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES AND NOT THAT PRACTICES

01:37:54.168 --> 01:37:57.839 region:rollup2
ACTIONS TO SERVICES THAT A

01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:59.173 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IS IMPLEMENTING.

01:37:57.839 --> 01:38:00.608 region:rollup2
I STAFF DISCUSSES WITH OUR

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:02.176 region:rollup2
SCHOOL LEADERS LOCAL MEASURES

01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:04.512 region:rollup2
AND INDICATED THAT THEY CAN

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:06.214 region:rollup2
MONITOR FREQUENTLY. TO ENABLE

01:38:04.512 --> 01:38:07.448 region:rollup2
TIMELY ADJUSTMENTS AND OF COURSE

01:38:06.214 --> 01:38:08.983 region:rollup2
CORRECTIONS IN A PROACTIVE

01:38:07.448 --> 01:38:10.718 region:rollup2
MANNER.

01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:13.921 region:rollup2
OUR APPROACH IN THESE EFFORTS IS

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:15.656 region:rollup2
TO EMPHASIZE REFLECTIVE INQUIRY

01:38:13.921 --> 01:38:16.991 region:rollup2
INTO THEIR DASHBOARD DATA.

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:18.025 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:20.495 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ALWAYS KNOW ALL THE

01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:22.263 region:rollup2
ANSWERS AND MANY OF THE BEST

01:38:20.495 --> 01:38:23.765 region:rollup2
ACTORS COME FROM OUR DISTRICTS

01:38:22.263 --> 01:38:25.600 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

01:38:23.765 --> 01:38:27.034 region:rollup2
SUPPORT. THIS TYPE OF REFLECTIVE

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:28.336 region:rollup2
INQUIRY.

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:29.771 region:rollup2
I SHARE ALL OF THIS WITH YOU

01:38:28.336 --> 01:38:31.639 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK IT REPRESENTS A

01:38:29.771 --> 01:38:32.774 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:35.943 region:rollup2
OUR CURRENT ACCOUNTABILITY

01:38:32.774 --> 01:38:37.645 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. AND WHAT USED TO EXIST

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:39.547 region:rollup2
NCLB AND OTHER PREVIOUS

01:38:37.645 --> 01:38:40.681 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES.

01:38:39.547 --> 01:38:42.917 region:rollup2
BEFORE SOMEONE FROM THE COUNTY

01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:44.619 region:rollup2
PAPPAS MIGHT GO INTO A DISPUTE

01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:46.020 region:rollup2
WITH THE BINDER OF STRATEGIES

01:38:44.619 --> 01:38:48.456 region:rollup2
THAT THE DISTRICT LEADERS HAD TO

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:50.024 region:rollup2
CHOOSE BROWN. WITH NO GUARANTEE

01:38:48.456 --> 01:38:51.759 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE STRATEGIES WOULD MOVE

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:52.794 region:rollup2
THE BALL FORWARD ON STUDENT

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:54.529 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT.

01:38:52.794 --> 01:38:56.264 region:rollup2
NOW WE ENTER INTO THE

01:38:54.529 --> 01:38:57.899 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR DISTRICT

01:38:56.264 --> 01:38:59.934 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES AS THOUGHT PARTNERS.

01:38:57.899 --> 01:39:01.402 region:rollup2
AND EXAMINE THE DASHBOARD DATA

01:38:59.934 --> 01:39:02.436 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IN SEARCH OF ROOT

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:04.338 region:rollup2
CAUSES.

01:39:02.436 --> 01:39:06.174 region:rollup2
SO WE WERE DIRECTED TO BEAT UP

01:39:04.338 --> 01:39:07.942 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE WE IN THAT WITH.

01:39:06.174 --> 01:39:09.410 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS.

01:39:07.942 --> 01:39:11.012 region:rollup2
WHO FELLOW TO DIFFERENTIATE

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:12.880 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE PROJECT TO THE WINTER

01:39:11.012 --> 01:39:15.750 region:rollup2
BREAK AND THEN WE HAD SUBSEQUENT

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.718 region:rollup2
MEETINGS WHERE OUR TEAM WENT OUT

01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:19.220 region:rollup2
AND MET WITH THE? AYE IDENTIFY

01:39:17.718 --> 01:39:20.721 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT

01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:23.658 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND LOOK

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:24.792 region:rollup2
AT THE LOG DATA NOW THIS IS THE

01:39:23.658 --> 01:39:26.961 region:rollup2
THIRD LEVEL WHERE WHERE THERE.

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:27.662 region:rollup2
ARE SITTING DOWN AND DECIDING ON

01:39:26.961 --> 01:39:30.498 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS GOING TO BE THE

01:39:27.662 --> 01:39:30.998 region:rollup2
APPROACH SO IT'S BEEN VERY

01:39:30.498 --> 01:39:32.233 region:rollup2
ACTIVE AS BEEN ONGOING.

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:34.335 region:rollup2
ONE GOING.

01:39:32.233 --> 01:39:36.704 region:rollup2
WE USE DATA ASSN INC RETOOL THAT

01:39:34.335 --> 01:39:37.638 region:rollup2
THESE TO DEEPER INVESTIGATIONS

01:39:36.704 --> 01:39:40.141 region:rollup2
SUGGEST QUESTIONS RELATED TO

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:40.708 region:rollup2
OUTCOME GAPS IN VARIATION OF

01:39:40.141 --> 01:39:41.409 region:rollup2
STUDENT PERFORMANCE BETWEEN

01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:42.743 region:rollup2
SITES.

01:39:41.409 --> 01:39:43.978 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE ARE

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:45.913 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING OUR STUDENTS WITH

01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:47.415 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES WE KNOW THAT THE

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:49.383 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THEMSELVES ARE NOT

01:39:47.415 --> 01:39:50.718 region:rollup2
CAUSING THE PROBLEM BUT RATHER

01:39:49.383 --> 01:39:52.420 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE SIX ESTIMATE

01:39:50.718 --> 01:39:54.455 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND HOW THE STUDENTS. ARE

01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:56.424 region:rollup2
BEING SERVED TO RESOLVE THOSE

01:39:54.455 --> 01:39:58.059 region:rollup2
ISSUES SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE IN

01:39:56.424 --> 01:40:00.194 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION. BOTH FROM THE

01:39:58.059 --> 01:40:01.229 region:rollup2
COUNTY OFFICE AND THE DISTRICT

01:40:00.194 --> 01:40:02.830 region:rollup2

OF PURPOSE AND A COMMON GOAL SO

01:40:15.443 --> 01:40:19.113 region:rollup2
AS A COUNTY OFFICE WHAT WE CHOSE

01:40:17.245 --> 01:40:21.649 region:rollup2

01:43:10.418 --> 01:43:12.853 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES.

01:43:11.352 --> 01:43:13.754 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:15.222 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF RECURRING THEMES AND

01:43:13.754 --> 01:43:17.191 region:rollup2
ALL THIS WORK.

01:43:15.222 --> 01:43:19.460 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION.

01:43:17.191 --> 01:43:22.363 region:rollup2
ALIGNMENT.

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:24.231 region:rollup2
BREAKING DOWN SILOS AND LASTLY

01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:25.933 region:rollup2
CLARITY OF PURPOSE MAKING SURE

01:43:24.231 --> 01:43:27.735 region:rollup2
THAT THE RIGHT PEOPLE ARE ON THE

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:29.570 region:rollup2
SAME PAGE WITH RESPECT TO WHAT

01:43:27.735 --> 01:43:30.871 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:33.741 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THOSE TASK NEEDS TO BE

01:43:30.871 --> 01:43:35.142 region:rollup2
COMPLETED. TO SUMMARIZE THERE IS

01:43:33.741 --> 01:43:36.010 region:rollup2
A LOT GOING ON AND THERE ARE A

01:43:35.142 --> 01:43:37.378 region:rollup2
LOT OF MOVING PARTS IN THE

01:43:36.010 --> 01:43:38.479 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:43:37.378 --> 01:43:40.347 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THOUGH WE ARE BLESSED

01:43:38.479 --> 01:43:42.817 region:rollup2
IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY TO BE ABLE

01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:44.151 region:rollup2
TO DEVOTE A LEVEL OF RESOURCE TO

01:43:42.817 --> 01:43:45.653 region:rollup2
TO THIS WORK THAT I THINK

01:43:44.151 --> 01:43:47.588 region:rollup2
COUNTIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

01:43:45.653 --> 01:43:50.024 region:rollup2
MATCH BECAUSE EACH COUNTIES.

01:43:47.588 --> 01:43:52.226 region:rollup2
UNIQUE FUNDING POSITION.

01:43:50.024 --> 01:43:53.828 region:rollup2
CAPACITY IS AN ISSUE WE HAVE TO

01:43:52.226 --> 01:43:55.463 region:rollup2
CONSIDER.

01:43:53.828 --> 01:43:57.264 region:rollup2
THAT ARE STILL E. WE ARE ALREADY

01:43:55.463 --> 01:43:58.966 region:rollup2
AT THE POINT IN HAVING TO.

01:43:57.264 --> 01:44:00.534 region:rollup2
TRIAGE OUR EFFORTS AND MAKE SOME

01:43:58.966 --> 01:44:01.569 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES AND

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:03.437 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO FOCUS

01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:06.006 region:rollup2
THE WORK.

01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:07.341 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY. WHEN THAT HAPPENS

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:08.976 region:rollup2
IT WHEN IT OCCURS THERE ARE

01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:10.911 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO.

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:11.979 region:rollup2
THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:13.280 region:rollup2
MAYBE AT THE RISK FOR NOT.

01:44:11.979 --> 01:44:14.515 region:rollup2
RECEIVING THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.816 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO IN ORDER TO BE

01:44:14.515 --> 01:44:17.685 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

01:44:15.816 --> 01:44:18.185 region:rollup2
IN CONCLUSION WE HAVE A WAY TO

01:44:17.685 --> 01:44:20.354 region:rollup2
GO BEFORE WE GET DECLARE

01:44:18.185 --> 01:44:22.757 region:rollup2
SIXPACK.

01:44:20.354 --> 01:44:24.592 region:rollup2
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WE ARE

01:44:22.757 --> 01:44:26.327 region:rollup2
ALL ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

01:44:24.592 --> 01:44:28.028 region:rollup2

EXPERT TEETH THAT I THINK THAT

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:41.141 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ONLY GET BY TAKING WHAT.

01:49:39.373 --> 01:49:42.443 region:rollup2
EACH ONE OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:45.612 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WOULD HAVE UNIQUE

01:49:42.443 --> 01:49:47.614 region:rollup2
NEEDS IN OUR PARTICULAR CASE I

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:50.117 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT CC  <u><c.green>HAS COME IN</c></u>

01:49:47.614 --> 01:49:51.285 region:rollup2
WORK WITH US I THOUGHT PARTNERS.

01:49:50.117 --> 01:49:52.820 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT THE.

01:49:51.285 --> 01:49:54.788 region:rollup2
THREE AREAS THAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:56.490 region:rollup2
AT IF OUR SUSPENSION WAIT.

01:49:54.788 --> 01:49:58.459 region:rollup2
SPECIAL LATEST ENCROACHING ON

01:49:56.490 --> 01:50:00.127 region:rollup2
MOST SIGNIFICANTLY OUR

01:49:58.459 --> 01:50:01.328 region:rollup2
GRADUATION THIS WELL AS OUR MATH

01:50:00.127 --> 01:50:03.597 region:rollup2
SCORES IF THE AREAS THAT WE'RE

01:50:01.328 --> 01:50:04.498 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON IN A CONTINUOUS

01:50:03.597 --> 01:50:06.900 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT PROCESS.

01:50:04.498 --> 01:50:09.036 region:rollup2
WE'VE TAKEN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:10.370 region:rollup2
ARE AL CAPP IN OUR SINGLES

01:50:09.036 --> 01:50:13.140 region:rollup2
PLAYERS FOR STUDENTS EXCEPT IN A

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:15.209 region:rollup2
LINE ALL OF THOSE. UTILIZING

01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:16.610 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF STRATEGIES THAT HAS

01:50:15.209 --> 01:50:19.179 region:rollup2
BEEN SHARED WITH THAT FORM OF.

01:50:16.610 --> 01:50:20.981 region:rollup2
I THINK THE E. SO I'M GONNA LET

01:50:19.179 --> 01:50:22.749 region:rollup2
HER SAY IF. MAKE A FEW POINTS

01:50:20.981 --> 01:50:24.184 region:rollup2
AND THEY WILL ADDRESS QUESTIONS

01:50:22.749 --> 01:50:25.786 region:rollup2
SUCH MAY HAVE.

01:50:24.184 --> 01:50:26.987 region:rollup2
TOM IT'S BEEN A JOURNEY AND OUT

01:50:25.786 --> 01:50:28.021 region:rollup2
RUNS GIVING ME WAY TOO MUCH

01:50:26.987 --> 01:50:30.924 region:rollup2
CREDIT.

01:50:28.021 --> 01:50:32.259 region:rollup2
YES I'M THERE BUT AT ITS RON

01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:34.027 region:rollup2
AND HIS TEAM AND ITS PRINCIPALS

01:50:32.259 --> 01:50:34.228 region:rollup2
AND TEACHERS THAT ARE DOING THE

01:50:34.027 --> 01:50:36.363 region:rollup2
WORK.

01:50:34.228 --> 01:50:38.665 region:rollup2
SO I NEED TO GIVE THEM HUGE

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:41.335 region:rollup2
CREDIT AND RON ESPECIALLY.

01:50:38.665 --> 01:50:43.737 region:rollup2
WE STARTED OFF THE JOURNEY WITH

01:50:41.335 --> 01:50:45.706 region:rollup2
SEE SEE WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:49.243 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE THAT

01:50:45.706 --> 01:50:51.011 region:rollup2
CC PROVIDES. IS THAT WE HAD NOT

01:50:49.243 --> 01:50:52.846 region:rollup2
ONLY BILL CAPACITY.

01:50:51.011 --> 01:50:55.349 region:rollup2
AMONGST OUR LEADERS AND WE

01:50:52.846 --> 01:50:58.785 region:rollup2
STARTED THIS PATH OF HAVING FIVE

01:50:55.349 --> 01:50:59.653 region:rollup2
TWO DAY SUMMIT PER SCHOOL YEAR.

01:50:58.785 --> 01:51:02.022 region:rollup2
AT THE BEGINNING OUR

01:50:59.653 --> 01:51:04.158 region:rollup2
SUPERINTENDENTS THE LEADS OF THE

01:51:02.022 --> 01:51:05.225 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WERE INVITED. AND

01:51:04.158 --> 01:51:07.895 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN ORDER TO BUILD

01:51:05.225 --> 01:51:09.296 region:rollup2
CAPACITY AND TO ASSIST IN

01:51:07.895 --> 01:51:11.632 region:rollup2
WHICHEVER WAY THEY.

01:51:09.296 --> 01:51:13.467 region:rollup2
WITH LIKE FOR US TO ASSIST.

01:51:11.632 --> 01:51:15.335 region:rollup2
AND THEN THAT WE HAD LIKE A

01:51:13.467 --> 01:51:17.671 region:rollup2
PIVOTAL TURN I BELIEVE IN

01:51:15.335 --> 01:51:19.740 region:rollup2
OCTOBER SUMMIT. WHERE WE REALLY

01:51:17.671 --> 01:51:21.842 region:rollup2
DIVE INTO THE CONTINUOUS

01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:23.510 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT PROCESS AND WE

01:51:21.842 --> 01:51:24.978 region:rollup2
LOOKED OUT ALL DIFFERENT MODELS

01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:27.948 region:rollup2
AND WE ALLOW?

01:51:24.978 --> 01:51:30.984 region:rollup2
OUR PILOT DISTRICTS YOU CHOOSE

01:51:27.948 --> 01:51:33.820 region:rollup2
THE MODEL AND AT THAT SUMMIT THE

01:51:30.984 --> 01:51:34.821 region:rollup2
MOST KEY IN PORN I BELIEVE.

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:37.558 region:rollup2
.

01:51:34.821 --> 01:51:39.626 region:rollup2
ASPECT WAS THAT IT WASN'T JUST

01:51:37.558 --> 01:51:41.995 region:rollup2
THE SUPERINTENDENT THAT WAS FAIR

01:51:39.626 --> 01:51:44.198 region:rollup2
IT WITH THIS TEAM. SO HE BROUGHT

01:51:41.995 --> 01:51:47.067 region:rollup2
IN HIS ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT

01:51:44.198 --> 01:51:50.170 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR WHO OVERSEES EL CAP HIS

01:51:47.067 --> 01:51:52.439 region:rollup2
PRINCIPAL AND HIS ART TEACHER.

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:54.474 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS E. L. BECAUSE WE ARE

01:51:52.439 --> 01:51:57.444 region:rollup2
ALSO LOOKING AT E. L. FOCUS.

01:51:54.474 --> 01:51:59.546 region:rollup2
SO IT WAS A COLLABORATIVE GROUP

01:51:57.444 --> 01:52:01.114 region:rollup2
A OF VICTOR VALLEY OF LEADERS

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:03.717 region:rollup2
COMING TOGETHER.

01:52:01.114 --> 01:52:05.218 region:rollup2
TO WORK ON VICTOR VALLEY SAY

01:52:03.717 --> 01:52:07.054 region:rollup2
WASN'T US THE SUPERINTENDENT

01:52:05.218 --> 01:52:09.423 region:rollup2
ALONG WHICH MADE A HUGE

01:52:07.054 --> 01:52:12.426 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE AND THEN AT THAT

01:52:09.423 --> 01:52:14.094 region:rollup2
SETTING. DATE DECIDED ON OKAY

01:52:12.426 --> 01:52:15.028 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA STICK TO THE PLAN TO

01:52:14.094 --> 01:52:16.830 region:rollup2
STUDY AT.

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:19.533 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT MODEL AND FROM

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:21.368 region:rollup2
THERE OF THE PRINCIPLE FROM

01:52:19.533 --> 01:52:24.004 region:rollup2
ATALANTA HIGH SCHOOL SHE DID A

01:52:21.368 --> 01:52:27.140 region:rollup2
FABULOUS JOB AFTERWARDS COMING

01:52:24.004 --> 01:52:28.308 region:rollup2
BACK. TO OF THE DISTRICT AND

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:30.510 region:rollup2
SHARING.

01:52:28.308 --> 01:52:32.980 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE JUST LEARNED SEC'S

01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:35.782 region:rollup2
SUMMIT TO THE PRINCIPLES?

01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:37.951 region:rollup2
AND THEN OF RONALD SO THOUGHT

01:52:35.782 --> 01:52:38.885 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ALSO CONTINUE

01:52:37.951 --> 01:52:41.655 region:rollup2
OUR.

01:52:38.885 --> 01:52:44.558 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT TEAM

01:52:41.655 --> 01:52:46.226 region:rollup2
WORK AND NEEDS MORE THAN JUST AT

01:52:44.558 --> 01:52:47.694 region:rollup2
THE SUMMIT.

01:52:46.226 --> 01:52:50.464 region:rollup2
SO THEN WE MET UP.

01:52:47.694 --> 01:52:52.299 region:rollup2
AFTER THAT I BELIEVE TWICE AND

01:52:50.464 --> 01:52:54.001 region:rollup2
EXPAND THAT THE GROUP TO EVEN

01:52:52.299 --> 01:52:55.202 region:rollup2
MORE AND YOU MAY ASK WELL WHY

01:52:54.001 --> 01:52:57.571 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU EVEN CONSIDER

01:52:55.202 --> 01:53:00.274 region:rollup2
EXPANDING AND IT'S BECAUSE.

01:52:57.571 --> 01:53:01.275 region:rollup2
JUANITA HAVE MORE IMPACTS AND

01:53:00.274 --> 01:53:04.611 region:rollup2
EFFECTS

01:53:01.275 --> 01:53:07.447 region:rollup2
AND A ONE OF THE STORY IS TOM.

01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:09.316 region:rollup2
A THE TEACHER FROM ADELANTO HIGH

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:12.519 region:rollup2
SCHOOL THAT WAS PART THAT'S PART

01:53:09.316 --> 01:53:14.454 region:rollup2
OF OUR SUMMIT A TERRY BLACK SHE

01:53:12.519 --> 01:53:16.223 region:rollup2
TEACHES SPECIAL EDUCATION AND

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:17.891 region:rollup2
SHE'S THE DEPARTMENT CHAIR. AND

01:53:16.223 --> 01:53:19.860 region:rollup2
SO WITH OUR CONTINUOUS

01:53:17.891 --> 01:53:22.663 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT MODEL SHE WAS VERY

01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:24.331 region:rollup2
EXCITED. ON AND SAID THAT I'M

01:53:22.663 --> 01:53:27.034 region:rollup2
GOING TO TAKE IT BACK.

01:53:24.331 --> 01:53:28.669 region:rollup2
TWO I ALL MY DEPARTMENT AND GO

01:53:27.034 --> 01:53:30.537 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CONTINUOUS

01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:32.572 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT MODEL WITH MY

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:33.707 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AND SEE WHAT WE COME

01:53:32.572 --> 01:53:36.443 region:rollup2
UP WITH.

01:53:33.707 --> 01:53:38.078 region:rollup2
SO OUR FOCUS AND OUR AND I'VE TO

01:53:36.443 --> 01:53:39.680 region:rollup2
SHARE WITH YOU THE FOCUS WAS A

01:53:38.078 --> 01:53:43.750 region:rollup2
JOURNEY IN A SELF.

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:44.451 region:rollup2
BECAUSE LAST YEAR THE BIG BOMB

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:47.754 region:rollup2
GLARING.

01:53:44.451 --> 01:53:49.556 region:rollup2
FOCUS WAS ON MATH

01:53:47.754 --> 01:53:51.425 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE SCORES WERE SOLO.

01:53:49.556 --> 01:53:52.993 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE SHIFTED AT THE

01:53:51.425 --> 01:53:55.228 region:rollup2
BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR

01:53:52.993 --> 01:53:57.731 region:rollup2
INTO INCLUDING E. L..

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:59.1000 region:rollup2
AND THEN AFTER THE RELEASE OF

01:53:57.731 --> 01:54:00.734 region:rollup2
THE FALL THE DECEMBER DASH BOARD

01:53:59.1000 --> 01:54:03.203 region:rollup2
OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT THE

01:54:00.734 --> 01:54:04.137 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION RATING GRADUATION

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:06.473 region:rollup2
INCLUDED.

01:54:04.137 --> 01:54:08.241 region:rollup2
IT WITHIN THE SUBGROUPS.

01:54:06.473 --> 01:54:11.011 region:rollup2
SO THEN IT EXPANDED BUT THEN

01:54:08.241 --> 01:54:13.113 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH THAT EXPANSION ON IT

01:54:11.011 --> 01:54:16.216 region:rollup2
WAS GREAT TIMING IN THAT.

01:54:13.113 --> 01:54:17.718 region:rollup2
THE YEARS STRATEGIC PLANNING.

01:54:16.216 --> 01:54:19.419 region:rollup2

COMMUNITY MEMBERS INCLUDED.

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:23.790 region:rollup2
MET UP AND ALSO REVIEWED DATA

01:54:22.456 --> 01:54:25.359 region:rollup2
AND LOOKED AT THE CONTINUOUS

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:27.627 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT MODEL AND THE

01:54:25.359 --> 01:54:28.729 region:rollup2
DISTRICT'S FOCUS. AND THEN THE

01:54:27.627 --> 01:54:30.097 region:rollup2
SINGLE PLAN FOR STUDENT

01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:32.466 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT SO IT ALL CAME

01:54:30.097 --> 01:54:34.701 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. AND I LOVE THE FACT

01:54:32.466 --> 01:54:36.203 region:rollup2
THAT THE TEACHER IS TAKING A

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:38.305 region:rollup2
BACK AND SAYING THIS IS AN

01:54:36.203 --> 01:54:42.109 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT MODEL THAT I COULD

01:54:38.305 --> 01:54:43.744 region:rollup2
USE WITH MY TEACHERS AT MY SIDE.

01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:47.147 region:rollup2

OUR SUPERINTENDENTS AT SORT OF

02:00:37.230 --> 02:00:40.266 region:rollup2
THING.

02:00:38.798 --> 02:00:42.802 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T DONE IN VICTOR VALLEY

02:00:40.266 --> 02:00:44.537 region:rollup2

02:00:42.802 --> 02:00:47.040 region:rollup2
PLACES WHERE WE'RE WORKING.

02:00:44.537 --> 02:00:48.708 region:rollup2

WE ASSOCIATED THE LARGER

02:01:04.023 --> 02:01:08.495 region:rollup2
URBAN'S I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY

02:01:06.493 --> 02:01:10.897 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE MEDIA COVERS THE

02:01:08.495 --> 02:01:12.432 region:rollup2
LARGER BANDS ON A DAILY BASIS

02:01:10.897 --> 02:01:13.433 region:rollup2

THAT WE'VE DEPLOYED DOING THE

02:02:53.933 --> 02:02:57.604 region:rollup2
WORKSHOPS THAT'S BEEN APART OUR

02:02:55.335 --> 02:02:59.906 region:rollup2

CHALLENGES.

02:03:51.724 --> 02:03:54.794 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION

02:03:53.092 --> 02:03:56.729 region:rollup2
EVERYONE FEELS THIS KIND OF.

WANT TO CHANGE THEMSELVES.

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:13.179 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S GOING TO MAKE THAT

02:04:11.711 --> 02:04:14.347 region:rollup2

FOR DISTRICTS THAT. TAKE THAT

02:04:20.853 --> 02:04:24.624 region:rollup2
APPROACH THEN.

02:04:22.622 --> 02:04:25.692 region:rollup2
THAT CHANGE WILL ONLY BE THERE

02:04:24.624 --> 02:04:27.427 region:rollup2
AS LONG AS THAT OUTSIDE

02:04:25.692 --> 02:04:28.661 region:rollup2
PRESSURES HERE BUT I THINK FOR

THOSE DISTRICT IT REALLY WANT TO

02:04:28.661 --> 02:04:32.231 region:rollup2

AN ORGANIZATION IS PROBABLY ONE

02:04:39.238 --> 02:04:42.141 region:rollup2
OF THE MOST CHALLENGES THAT ANY

LEADER TAKES ON.

02:04:42.141 --> 02:04:46.079 region:rollup2

INSTITUTED AND HAVE.

02:04:46.079 --> 02:04:49.515 region:rollup2
LOOK BACK PROCESSES TO CHECK TO

THERE NEEDS TO BE. SOME AREAS

02:05:42.702 --> 02:05:46.372 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WORKING WELL AND

02:05:44.837 --> 02:05:47.874 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE I BELIEVE.

02:05:46.372 --> 02:05:51.344 region:rollup2

02:14:28.661 --> 02:14:31.964 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS.

02:14:30.429 --> 02:14:33.766 region:rollup2
AND A STRONG NETWORK OF

02:14:31.964 --> 02:14:35.534 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION IN ORDER TO STOP A

02:14:33.766 --> 02:14:36.869 region:rollup2
MINUTE HERE AND JUST KEY IN ON

02:14:35.534 --> 02:14:38.237 region:rollup2
THIS AND I THINK I THOUGHT WAS

02:14:36.869 --> 02:14:39.738 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT

02:14:38.237 --> 02:14:41.473 region:rollup2
SUPERINTENDENT BLAKE SAID ABOUT.

02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:42.408 region:rollup2
HOW YOU KNOW IN IN IN OTHER

02:14:41.473 --> 02:14:43.909 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HE'S HEARD

02:14:42.408 --> 02:14:45.044 region:rollup2
SUPERINTENDENT SAY THAT YOU KNOW

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:46.078 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T THEY DON'T TALK TO

02:14:45.044 --> 02:14:48.147 region:rollup2
THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY DON'T

02:14:46.078 --> 02:14:48.881 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY HAVE AN ESTABLISHED

02:14:48.147 --> 02:14:50.082 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP TO DO THAT AND I

02:14:48.881 --> 02:14:52.184 region:rollup2
THINK THAT? ONE OF THE THINGS

02:14:50.082 --> 02:14:53.385 region:rollup2
THAT'S KEY TO THE STATE SYSTEM

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:56.021 region:rollup2
OF SUPPORT ON IS ALLOWING PEOPLE

02:14:53.385 --> 02:14:56.622 region:rollup2
TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND

02:14:56.021 --> 02:14:57.723 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT RESOURCES ARE

02:14:56.622 --> 02:15:00.626 region:rollup2
OUT THERE.

02:14:57.723 --> 02:15:04.630 region:rollup2
SO THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT.

02:15:00.626 --> 02:15:05.164 region:rollup2
IS. REALLY FOCUSED ON EITHER

02:15:04.630 --> 02:15:05.698 region:rollup2
SIDE A NETWORK BY BEING A

02:15:05.164 --> 02:15:07.299 region:rollup2
NETWORK OF COLLABORATION

02:15:05.698 --> 02:15:08.534 region:rollup2
INNOVATION INFORMATION SHARING.

02:15:07.299 --> 02:15:10.102 region:rollup2
WITH A FOCUS ON IMPROVING

02:15:08.534 --> 02:15:10.836 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC OUTCOMES FOR ALL

02:15:10.102 --> 02:15:12.071 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

02:15:10.836 --> 02:15:14.540 region:rollup2
AND REALLY CREATING A FOCUSED

02:15:12.071 --> 02:15:16.208 region:rollup2
ON CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT SET

02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:18.210 region:rollup2
ASIDE EIGHT GOALS.

02:15:16.208 --> 02:15:19.044 region:rollup2
SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

02:15:18.210 --> 02:15:21.046 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES.

02:15:19.044 --> 02:15:22.948 region:rollup2
.

02:15:21.046 --> 02:15:23.882 region:rollup2
I'M SURE YOU'VE YOU'VE BUT WE'VE

02:15:22.948 --> 02:15:24.583 region:rollup2
KIND OF ARTY TOUCH ON THE FACT

02:15:23.882 --> 02:15:25.951 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:15:24.583 --> 02:15:27.453 region:rollup2
NEAR THE ADMINISTRATION IS

02:15:25.951 --> 02:15:28.687 region:rollup2
PROPOSING FIFTY FIVE MILLION

02:15:27.453 --> 02:15:30.789 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF

02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:32.157 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

02:15:30.789 --> 02:15:34.259 region:rollup2
FOR IT LEAD COUNTY OFFICES OF

02:15:32.157 --> 02:15:35.594 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. AS WELL AS ELEVEN

02:15:34.259 --> 02:15:37.429 region:rollup2
POINT THREE MILLION ON GOING FOR

02:15:35.594 --> 02:15:39.398 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE AYE

02:15:37.429 --> 02:15:39.898 region:rollup2
WE TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IN

02:15:39.398 --> 02:15:42.701 region:rollup2
IN BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE.

02:15:39.898 --> 02:15:44.470 region:rollup2
BUT THE FOCUS OF THOSE FUNDS IS

02:15:42.701 --> 02:15:45.771 region:rollup2
REALLY ON BUILDING. A SUPPORT

02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:47.706 region:rollup2
NETWORK OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:15:45.771 --> 02:15:50.009 region:rollup2
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:15:47.706 --> 02:15:52.244 region:rollup2
SO I WANTED TO STOP RIGHT THERE

02:15:50.009 --> 02:15:53.078 region:rollup2
AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AND

02:15:52.244 --> 02:15:53.812 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU PART

02:15:53.078 --> 02:15:56.348 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT SENATOR ALLEN.

02:15:53.812 --> 02:15:57.750 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE ROLES

02:15:56.348 --> 02:15:58.217 region:rollup2
THAT THAT FOLKS ARE PLAYING IN

02:15:57.750 --> 02:16:00.386 region:rollup2
WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE

02:15:58.217 --> 02:16:02.888 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

02:16:00.386 --> 02:16:03.789 region:rollup2
SO IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE

02:16:02.888 --> 02:16:05.624 region:rollup2
DO TALK ABOUT COUNTY OFFICE OF

02:16:03.789 --> 02:16:07.259 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IS THE PRIMARY SUPPORT

02:16:05.624 --> 02:16:09.228 region:rollup2
PROVIDER FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:16:07.259 --> 02:16:09.795 region:rollup2
I WANT TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS

02:16:09.228 --> 02:16:11.130 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I THINK

02:16:09.795 --> 02:16:12.998 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CEMENT MISINFORMATION

02:16:11.130 --> 02:16:15.234 region:rollup2
OUT THERE.

02:16:12.998 --> 02:16:16.502 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT

02:16:15.234 --> 02:16:18.470 region:rollup2
PROPOSE THAT COUNTY OFFICE OF

02:16:16.502 --> 02:16:20.572 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ARE THE ONLY SUPPORT

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:21.807 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AVAILABLE TO SCHOOL

02:16:20.572 --> 02:16:23.509 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WHETHER THEY'RE

02:16:21.807 --> 02:16:24.777 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED FOR DIFFERENTIATED

02:16:23.509 --> 02:16:26.311 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE OR NOT.

02:16:24.777 --> 02:16:29.014 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE LCF OF

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:30.949 region:rollup2
FUNDS AND THAT THEY CAN USE TO

02:16:29.014 --> 02:16:32.684 region:rollup2
PROCURE ANY TYPE OF SUPPORT THAT

02:16:30.949 --> 02:16:34.520 region:rollup2
THEY WISH TO TO PROCURE.

02:16:32.684 --> 02:16:36.722 region:rollup2
WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PAN

02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:38.023 region:rollup2
PROPOSES IS THAT IF THE SCHOOLS

02:16:36.722 --> 02:16:40.125 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED FOR DIFFERENTIATED

02:16:38.023 --> 02:16:41.126 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE BUT THEY DO NEED TO

02:16:40.125 --> 02:16:42.227 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THEIR COUNTY OFFICE OF

02:16:41.126 --> 02:16:43.562 region:rollup2
EDUCATION?

02:16:42.227 --> 02:16:45.998 region:rollup2
BUT THEY DO NEED TO BRING IN

02:16:43.562 --> 02:16:47.933 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PARTNER BECAUSE IN IN

02:16:45.998 --> 02:16:49.601 region:rollup2
THE INSTANCE OF BEING IDENTIFIED

02:16:47.933 --> 02:16:51.203 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BASICALLY SHOWING THAT.

02:16:49.601 --> 02:16:52.538 region:rollup2
THERE REALLY STRUGGLING AT

02:16:51.203 --> 02:16:53.739 region:rollup2
LEAST ONCE A GROUP OF STUDENTS

02:16:52.538 --> 02:16:55.974 region:rollup2
AND EIGHT WE WANT TO SEE SOMEONE

02:16:53.739 --> 02:16:59.144 region:rollup2
ELSE COME IN AND PROVIDE SINCE

02:16:55.974 --> 02:17:00.379 region:rollup2
SOME SUPPORT.

02:16:59.144 --> 02:17:02.314 region:rollup2
WE ALSO REQUIRE THAT SCHOOL

02:17:00.379 --> 02:17:03.082 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED AND HAS

02:17:02.314 --> 02:17:05.384 region:rollup2
BEEN IN NEED OF DIFFERENCE IS

02:17:03.082 --> 02:17:07.019 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS EXCEPT ASSISTANCE.

02:17:05.384 --> 02:17:08.954 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT.

02:17:07.019 --> 02:17:10.823 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE COUNTY OFFICE OF

02:17:08.954 --> 02:17:13.625 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SAYS AS WHAT THEY HAVE

02:17:10.823 --> 02:17:16.061 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS IS REALLY AN AT AN

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:16.628 region:rollup2
OUTGROWTH OF THE WORK AROUND THE

02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:17.696 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY

02:17:16.628 --> 02:17:19.198 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:17:17.696 --> 02:17:20.232 region:rollup2
COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION

02:17:19.198 --> 02:17:20.799 region:rollup2
ALREADY WORKED CLOSELY WITH

02:17:20.232 --> 02:17:22.634 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON THE ALL

02:17:20.799 --> 02:17:24.470 region:rollup2
CAPS.

02:17:22.634 --> 02:17:26.772 region:rollup2
THEY ARE THAT THE REVIEWERS OF

02:17:24.470 --> 02:17:28.073 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT ALL CAPS AND THEY

02:17:26.772 --> 02:17:29.441 region:rollup2
ARE ON THE APPROVER IS THAT THE

02:17:28.073 --> 02:17:30.008 region:rollup2
DISTRICT ALCOTT.

02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:32.511 region:rollup2
SO IT VERY MUCH MAKES SENSE

02:17:30.008 --> 02:17:33.812 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:17:32.511 --> 02:17:34.279 region:rollup2
IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT ESPECIALLY

02:17:33.812 --> 02:17:35.147 region:rollup2
ONE THAT'S IN NEED OF

02:17:34.279 --> 02:17:38.183 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE.

02:17:35.147 --> 02:17:39.518 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO TO BE WORKING ON

02:17:38.183 --> 02:17:40.753 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING SOME OF THEIR ISSUES

02:17:39.518 --> 02:17:42.020 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING IT

02:17:40.753 --> 02:17:45.557 region:rollup2
ALONGSIDE THEIR COUNTY OFFICE OF

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:46.258 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:48.127 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF

02:17:46.258 --> 02:17:49.061 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AROUND THE CREATION

02:17:48.127 --> 02:17:51.363 region:rollup2
OF LEAD COUNTY OFFICES OF

02:17:49.061 --> 02:17:52.564 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WHICH IS ANOTHER PIECE

02:17:51.363 --> 02:17:54.666 region:rollup2
OF OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:17:52.564 --> 02:17:56.668 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

02:17:54.666 --> 02:17:58.103 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO AND GO BACK TO

02:17:56.668 --> 02:17:59.505 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AS SENATOR ALAN THAT

02:17:58.103 --> 02:18:01.640 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED ABOUT.

02:17:59.505 --> 02:18:03.375 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF THE C. C. E. VERSUS

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:05.410 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF COUNTIES.

02:18:03.375 --> 02:18:06.445 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THE COLLABORATIVE

02:18:05.410 --> 02:18:07.880 region:rollup2
AND COUNTIES BOTH PLAYING

02:18:06.445 --> 02:18:10.916 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART IN THE STATE

02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:13.385 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF SUPPORT.

02:18:10.916 --> 02:18:14.987 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES ARE.

02:18:13.385 --> 02:18:16.522 region:rollup2
I GUESS AT SOME OF OUR FOUR

02:18:14.987 --> 02:18:19.258 region:rollup2
PANELISTS MENTIONED THESE ARE

02:18:16.522 --> 02:18:20.425 region:rollup2
THE THE THE. THE PARTNERS OF OUR

02:18:19.258 --> 02:18:20.893 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE NATURAL

02:18:20.425 --> 02:18:21.727 region:rollup2
PARTNERS TO OUR SCHOOL

02:18:20.893 --> 02:18:23.028 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS.

02:18:21.727 --> 02:18:24.062 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY HAVE BEEN

02:18:23.028 --> 02:18:25.297 region:rollup2
THERE HEY UNDERSTAND THEIR

02:18:24.062 --> 02:18:27.065 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND THEY WILL

02:18:25.297 --> 02:18:28.333 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE THERE.

02:18:27.065 --> 02:18:30.235 region:rollup2
EVEN AFTER.

02:18:28.333 --> 02:18:31.670 region:rollup2
A SCHOOL DISTRICT MAYBE IMPROVE

02:18:30.235 --> 02:18:33.372 region:rollup2
THEIR SCORES OR EVEN IF THEY

02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:34.439 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DECLINE.

02:18:33.372 --> 02:18:35.841 region:rollup2
THEY ARE THE PARTNER THAT WILL

02:18:34.439 --> 02:18:37.576 region:rollup2
BE THERE FOR THE LONG TERM WE

02:18:35.841 --> 02:18:39.211 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT THE.

02:18:37.576 --> 02:18:40.913 region:rollup2
STING SYSTEM OR THE FEDERAL

02:18:39.211 --> 02:18:42.347 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WHERE I'M YOU

02:18:40.913 --> 02:18:44.416 region:rollup2
HAD MONEY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF

02:18:42.347 --> 02:18:45.784 region:rollup2
TIME AND PEOPLE CAME IN. AND YOU

02:18:44.416 --> 02:18:46.885 region:rollup2
SAW IMPROVEMENTS ARE GAINES BUT

02:18:45.784 --> 02:18:48.487 region:rollup2
IT WAS ONLY AS LONG AS THE MONEY

02:18:46.885 --> 02:18:52.524 region:rollup2
LASTED.

02:18:48.487 --> 02:18:54.226 region:rollup2
pA SENSE OF CONTINUITY.

02:18:52.524 --> 02:18:56.061 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN ONCE.

02:18:54.226 --> 02:18:57.496 region:rollup2
WHOEVER'S PROVIDING SUPPORT

02:18:56.061 --> 02:18:59.131 region:rollup2
LEAVES THE COUNTY OFFICES OF

02:18:57.496 --> 02:19:00.732 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL BE THERE. THEY'LL BE

02:18:59.131 --> 02:19:02.067 region:rollup2
THERE IN THE GOOD TIMES TO

02:19:00.732 --> 02:19:04.036 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THAT TIER ONE LEVEL OF

02:19:02.067 --> 02:19:05.871 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THEY'LL BE THERE IN THE

02:19:04.036 --> 02:19:06.271 region:rollup2
BAD TIMES TO BE PARTNERS MATURE

02:19:05.871 --> 02:19:07.539 region:rollup2
TO MATURE THREE.

02:19:06.271 --> 02:19:11.443 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE CONTINUITY OF THE

02:19:07.539 --> 02:19:13.245 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:19:11.443 --> 02:19:14.446 region:rollup2
WE ALSO AND IN OUR LANGUAGE

02:19:13.245 --> 02:19:15.814 region:rollup2
PROVIDE AVENUES.

02:19:14.446 --> 02:19:17.749 region:rollup2
FOR THE COUNTY OFFICES OF

02:19:15.814 --> 02:19:18.951 region:rollup2
EDUCATION UMP THE DEAD THE

02:19:17.749 --> 02:19:20.552 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE AND THE DEPARTMENT

02:19:18.951 --> 02:19:22.321 region:rollup2
TO ASSIST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

02:19:20.552 --> 02:19:22.955 region:rollup2
NEED OF EXTRAORDINARY SUPPORT.

02:19:22.321 --> 02:19:24.590 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHERE WE SEE THE COUNT

02:19:22.955 --> 02:19:26.325 region:rollup2
OF THE COLLABORATIVE REALLY

02:19:24.590 --> 02:19:27.292 region:rollup2
PLAYING AN IMPORTANT PART.

02:19:26.325 --> 02:19:28.627 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR COUNTY

02:19:27.292 --> 02:19:30.562 region:rollup2
OFFICES OF EDUCATION.

02:19:28.627 --> 02:19:31.630 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY NEED TO DO SOME WORK

02:19:30.562 --> 02:19:32.097 region:rollup2
ON BUILDING THEIR OWN CAPACITY

02:19:31.630 --> 02:19:33.865 region:rollup2
IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL

02:19:32.097 --> 02:19:35.601 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE.

02:19:33.865 --> 02:19:37.469 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THE COLLABORATIVE

02:19:35.601 --> 02:19:39.304 region:rollup2
CAN REALLY BE HELPFUL NOT WORK.

02:19:37.469 --> 02:19:41.807 region:rollup2
I'M WE ALSO SEE THAT THEY CAN BE

02:19:39.304 --> 02:19:43.475 region:rollup2
REALLY HELPFUL ON INCOMING IN

02:19:41.807 --> 02:19:45.510 region:rollup2
THAT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT

02:19:43.475 --> 02:19:47.012 region:rollup2
MAYBE IN CRISIS OR.

02:19:45.510 --> 02:19:48.347 region:rollup2
ADDED AT RISK FOR BECOMING

THE HANDOUT DESCRIBES OUR

ASSESSMENTS OF THESE PROPOSALS

02:22:56.234 --> 02:22:58.970 region:rollup2
SO OUR CONCERN. WITH THE

02:22:57.235 --> 02:23:00.272 region:rollup2
REGIONALLY PROPOSAL IS THAT A P.

02:22:58.970 --> 02:23:01.606 region:rollup2
IT APPEARS DUPLICATIVE TO BOOK

02:23:00.272 --> 02:23:03.108 region:rollup2
NEWLY ESTABLISHED ROLES WITHIN

02:23:01.606 --> 02:23:04.643 region:rollup2
THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM AN

02:23:03.108 --> 02:23:07.078 region:rollup2
ALREADY EXISTING REGIONALES

02:23:04.643 --> 02:23:08.814 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE. SO FOR EXAMPLE ELEVEN

02:23:07.078 --> 02:23:10.916 region:rollup2
COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION

02:23:08.814 --> 02:23:12.250 region:rollup2
ALREADY RECEIVE FUNDING SERVICE

02:23:10.916 --> 02:23:13.652 region:rollup2
REGIONAL MEANS.

02:23:12.250 --> 02:23:14.219 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO A LACK OF CLARITY

02:23:13.652 --> 02:23:16.588 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING THE ROLE OF THE

02:23:14.219 --> 02:23:17.856 region:rollup2
REGIONAL LEAD SO FOR EXAMPLE. A

02:23:16.588 --> 02:23:18.990 region:rollup2
COUNTY OFFICE REGIONAL LEAVES

02:23:17.856 --> 02:23:20.292 region:rollup2
ARE INTENDED TO BUILD THE

CAPACITY COUNTYOFFICE OF

02:23:20.292 --> 02:23:23.395 region:rollup2
EDUCATION BUT ALSO PART OF THEIR

02:23:21.993 --> 02:23:25.397 region:rollup2
ROLE IS TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS

02:23:23.395 --> 02:23:27.332 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY. OMITS UNCLEAR AT WHAT

02:23:25.397 --> 02:23:28.433 region:rollup2
POINT ON A REGIONAL LEGAL

02:23:27.332 --> 02:23:30.402 region:rollup2
SUPPORT DISTRICTS AND HOW

02:23:28.433 --> 02:23:31.670 region:rollup2
DECISIONS TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS

02:23:30.402 --> 02:23:33.371 region:rollup2
WILL BE MADE.

02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:34.940 region:rollup2
THIS LACK OF CLARITY ALSO RAISES

02:23:33.371 --> 02:23:37.142 region:rollup2
CONCERNS FOR THE CELLPHONE ROLES

02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:37.309 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE PROPOSAL'S INTENDING

02:23:37.142 --> 02:23:38.610 region:rollup2
TO.

02:23:37.309 --> 02:23:39.978 region:rollup2
TO ADD SELF WAS TO THE

02:23:38.610 --> 02:23:42.080 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION OF IMPROVING

02:23:39.978 --> 02:23:43.849 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THE LACK OF CLARISSE

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:45.150 region:rollup2
CLARITY SURROUNDING THE ROLE

02:23:43.849 --> 02:23:46.551 region:rollup2
COULD RESULT IN COUNTIES

02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:47.452 region:rollup2
DEFERRING DISTRICT SUPPORT TO

02:23:46.551 --> 02:23:48.720 region:rollup2
CELEBUZZ AND AND OUR CONCERN IS

02:23:47.452 --> 02:23:50.489 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD DISCONNECT SPECIAL

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:52.023 region:rollup2
EDUCATION PERFORMANCE ISSUES.

02:23:50.489 --> 02:23:53.325 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER STUDENT PERFORMANCE

02:23:52.023 --> 02:23:54.493 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

02:23:53.325 --> 02:23:55.660 region:rollup2
ON ANOTHER NOTE CELL PHONES ARE

02:23:54.493 --> 02:23:57.329 region:rollup2
EXPERTS PROVIDING SPECIAL

02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:58.563 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SERVICES UP BUT THE

02:23:57.329 --> 02:24:00.098 region:rollup2
ISSUES THE DASHBOARD HIGHLIGHTS

02:23:58.563 --> 02:24:01.233 region:rollup2
OUR GENERAL EDUCATION ISSUES

02:24:00.098 --> 02:24:02.834 region:rollup2
SUCH AS TEST SCORES AND

02:24:01.233 --> 02:24:04.102 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION RATES. A WE WOULD

02:24:02.834 --> 02:24:05.036 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THAT THE PERFORMANCE

02:24:04.102 --> 02:24:06.638 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT THE DASHBOARD

02:24:05.036 --> 02:24:08.039 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTS OUR GENERAL EDUCATION

02:24:06.638 --> 02:24:09.474 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT ARE DICTATED BY THE

02:24:08.039 --> 02:24:10.876 region:rollup2
SAME POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

02:24:09.474 --> 02:24:13.111 region:rollup2
THAT APPLY TO US ALL STUDENT

02:24:10.876 --> 02:24:14.212 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE ON

02:24:13.111 --> 02:24:15.947 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE FOR STUDENTS WITH

02:24:14.212 --> 02:24:17.949 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES IS LARGELY

02:24:15.947 --> 02:24:20.452 region:rollup2
DETERMINED BY GENERAL EDUCATION

02:24:17.949 --> 02:24:22.354 region:rollup2
TEACHERS WHO HA OF STUDENTS WITH

02:24:20.452 --> 02:24:23.221 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES IN THE CLASSROOM.

02:24:22.354 --> 02:24:25.357 region:rollup2
ALL THIS TO SAY IT'S UNCLEAR TO

02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:27.092 region:rollup2
US WHY WE NEED A SEPARATE ENTITY

02:24:25.357 --> 02:24:28.393 region:rollup2
INTERVENING FOR ISSUE SPECIFIC

02:24:27.092 --> 02:24:29.427 region:rollup2
TO STUDENTS WITH THE BEST WITH

02:24:28.393 --> 02:24:30.929 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES AND THEN RELY ON A

02:24:29.427 --> 02:24:32.330 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SOURCE OF EXPERTISE

02:24:30.929 --> 02:24:33.698 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE SAME ISSUES WHEN THEY

02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:35.333 region:rollup2
OCCUR WITH OTHER STUDENT

02:24:33.698 --> 02:24:37.168 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

02:24:35.333 --> 02:24:37.702 region:rollup2
SO PAGE THREE WE DISCUSS OUR

02:24:37.168 --> 02:24:40.305 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:24:37.702 --> 02:24:41.540 region:rollup2
SO GIVEN OUR CONCERNS WITH THE

02:24:40.305 --> 02:24:43.642 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND

02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:44.109 region:rollup2
SHE REJECTING BOTH THE REGIONAL

02:24:43.642 --> 02:24:45.210 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THE REGIONALLY

02:24:44.109 --> 02:24:47.412 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS.

02:24:45.210 --> 02:24:48.947 region:rollup2
IN BECAUSE CREATING OF THE SITE

02:24:47.412 --> 02:24:50.515 region:rollup2
PRE CREATING THESE ROLES ON

02:24:48.947 --> 02:24:53.285 region:rollup2
LEADS TO UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION

02:24:50.515 --> 02:24:54.452 region:rollup2
AND BUT ALSO SELF WAS THE SUPPLE

02:24:53.285 --> 02:24:57.022 region:rollup2
ROLE COULD SILO SUPPORT INSTEAD

02:24:54.452 --> 02:24:57.789 region:rollup2
OF FOSTERING CONVERSATION THAT'S

02:24:57.022 --> 02:24:59.357 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS.

02:24:57.789 --> 02:25:00.625 region:rollup2
SO WE PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE TO

02:24:59.357 --> 02:25:02.594 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT WE

02:25:00.625 --> 02:25:03.929 region:rollup2
THINK MAINTAIN THE LEGISLATIVE

02:25:02.594 --> 02:25:04.963 region:rollup2
INTENT OF LC A FIVE UP WITHOUT

02:25:03.929 --> 02:25:07.399 region:rollup2
CREATING ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF

02:25:04.963 --> 02:25:07.866 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT. WE RECOMMEND USING

02:25:07.399 --> 02:25:09.568 region:rollup2
THE COLLABORATIVE FOR

02:25:07.866 --> 02:25:11.002 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE WHICH IS

02:25:09.568 --> 02:25:14.372 region:rollup2
THE NEW ENTITY THAT WAS FORMED

02:25:11.002 --> 02:25:16.541 region:rollup2
GENERALLY TO ASSIST DISTRICTS.

02:25:14.372 --> 02:25:17.676 region:rollup2
BUT USING IT AS AN ENTITY THAT

02:25:16.541 --> 02:25:18.843 region:rollup2
OPERATES SIMILAR EFFECT MATT. ON

02:25:17.676 --> 02:25:19.911 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE STATE'S FISCAL

02:25:18.843 --> 02:25:20.812 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY ENTITY SO WE

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:22.347 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THIS WOULD BE A CHANGE

02:25:20.812 --> 02:25:24.015 region:rollup2
FROM CURRENT LAW AND WHAT THE

02:25:22.347 --> 02:25:25.684 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES. BUT

02:25:24.015 --> 02:25:27.819 region:rollup2
PERFECT ABOUT ONCE A DISTRICT

02:25:25.684 --> 02:25:29.220 region:rollup2
HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE NEEDS

02:25:27.819 --> 02:25:30.121 region:rollup2
FISCAL ASSISTANCE DEVELOPED A

02:25:29.220 --> 02:25:32.457 region:rollup2
TEAM OF EXPERTS.

02:25:30.121 --> 02:25:33.892 region:rollup2
THAT CAN SUPPORT THE DISTRICT

02:25:32.457 --> 02:25:35.360 region:rollup2
IN SOME VERY SPECIFIC AREAS. WE

02:25:33.892 --> 02:25:36.428 region:rollup2
THINK WE COULD BUILD OFF THAT

02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:37.162 region:rollup2
THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH

02:25:36.428 --> 02:25:40.065 region:rollup2
THICK MAT OF SUPPORTING

02:25:37.162 --> 02:25:40.565 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS AND MODEL THE

02:25:40.065 --> 02:25:41.466 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE TO OPERATE

02:25:40.565 --> 02:25:43.101 region:rollup2
SIMILARLY.

02:25:41.466 --> 02:25:44.369 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST STEP IN ALTERNATIVE

02:25:43.101 --> 02:25:45.904 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE IDENTIFIED DISTRICT

02:25:44.369 --> 02:25:46.805 region:rollup2
WOULD WORK WITH COUNTY OFFICE OF

02:25:45.904 --> 02:25:48.974 region:rollup2
WITH COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION

02:25:46.805 --> 02:25:49.874 region:rollup2
TO UNCOVER THEIR ROOT CAUSES IN

02:25:48.974 --> 02:25:50.775 region:rollup2
THE PERFORMANCE ISSUE WERE

02:25:49.874 --> 02:25:51.810 region:rollup2
CAUGHT ROOT CAUSES FOR THEIR

02:25:50.775 --> 02:25:53.078 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE ISSUES. AND THIS IS

02:25:51.810 --> 02:25:54.546 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY HAVE

02:25:53.078 --> 02:25:56.448 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED TODAY AS WHAT THEY'RE

02:25:54.546 --> 02:25:57.582 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY DOING. I'M SO ONCE THE

02:25:56.448 --> 02:25:59.284 region:rollup2
COUNTY COMPLETED THIS RECALLS

02:25:57.582 --> 02:26:00.552 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE

02:25:59.284 --> 02:26:01.753 region:rollup2
THAT THE DISTRICT WOULD THEN

02:26:00.552 --> 02:26:03.455 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THE COLLABORATIVE. TO

02:26:01.753 --> 02:26:04.623 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY AN EXPERT OR TEAM OF

02:26:03.455 --> 02:26:05.657 region:rollup2
EXPERTS THAT THE DISTRICT COULD

02:26:04.623 --> 02:26:07.392 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE

02:26:05.657 --> 02:26:08.793 region:rollup2
ROOT CAUSES FOR PERFORMANCE

02:26:07.392 --> 02:26:10.228 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:11.396 region:rollup2
THE EXPERTS I'M IDENTIFIED HERE

02:26:10.228 --> 02:26:13.498 region:rollup2
COULD BE COUNTY OFFICES OF

02:26:11.396 --> 02:26:15.166 region:rollup2
EDUCATION OTHER PROVIDERS OF

02:26:13.498 --> 02:26:17.102 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SERVICES AND EDUCATION

02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:17.969 region:rollup2
CONSULTANT SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:26:17.102 --> 02:26:19.104 region:rollup2
THE IDEA IS A COLLABORATIVE

02:26:17.969 --> 02:26:21.106 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE EXPERTS UNDER

02:26:19.104 --> 02:26:22.941 region:rollup2
CONTRACT SO THAT WE NEEDED

02:26:21.106 --> 02:26:24.376 region:rollup2
EXPERTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR

02:26:22.941 --> 02:26:25.410 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT NEED SUPPORT.

02:26:24.376 --> 02:26:26.811 region:rollup2
THE RECOMMENDED SYSTEM WOULD

02:26:25.410 --> 02:26:27.912 region:rollup2
PROVIDE DISTRICTS WITH GREATER

02:26:26.811 --> 02:26:29.314 region:rollup2
CHOICE IN SELECTING EXPERTS ARE

02:26:27.912 --> 02:26:30.548 region:rollup2
NOT REQUIRED DISTRICTS COULD

02:26:29.314 --> 02:26:32.117 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THE COLLABORATIVE TO

02:26:30.548 --> 02:26:33.652 region:rollup2
CHOOSE THE CONTRACTED EXPERTS

02:26:32.117 --> 02:26:35.253 region:rollup2
I'M BEST SUITED TO HELP ADDRESS

02:26:33.652 --> 02:26:36.454 region:rollup2
THEIR KEY PERFORMANCE ISSUES.

02:26:35.253 --> 02:26:38.290 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK DISTRICTS HAVE A

02:26:36.454 --> 02:26:40.325 region:rollup2
STRONG INCENTIVE TO CHOOSE OUR

02:26:38.290 --> 02:26:41.526 region:rollup2
PER SUPPORT PROVIDERS WISELY.

02:26:40.325 --> 02:26:42.427 region:rollup2
UNDER STATE LAW IF DISTRICTS

02:26:41.526 --> 02:26:43.828 region:rollup2
FACE REPERCUSSIONS IF THEY FAIL

02:26:42.427 --> 02:26:45.430 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE ON THE GET INTO

02:26:43.828 --> 02:26:46.731 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE INTERVENTION AFTER

02:26:45.430 --> 02:26:48.600 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS OF POOR DISTRICT

02:26:46.731 --> 02:26:49.668 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE. ONCE THEY GET INTO

02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:50.769 region:rollup2
IT INTENSIVE INTERVENTION THE

02:26:49.668 --> 02:26:52.537 region:rollup2
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC

02:26:50.769 --> 02:26:55.040 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION CAN REQUIRE BUDGET

02:26:52.537 --> 02:26:57.409 region:rollup2
AND HEALTHCARE PROVISIONS ON AS

02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:59.310 region:rollup2
WELL AS STAN RESCIND AB DISTRICT

02:26:57.409 --> 02:27:00.111 region:rollup2
BOARD DECISIONS.

02:26:59.310 --> 02:27:00.712 region:rollup2
I'M WITH ALL THE SAID REPRESENT

02:27:00.111 --> 02:27:01.346 region:rollup2
THIS OPTION TO DISPLAY THAT

02:27:00.712 --> 02:27:02.013 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE MODEL FOR

02:27:01.346 --> 02:27:03.014 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER TO

02:27:02.013 --> 02:27:04.683 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OUTCOME OF

02:27:03.014 --> 02:27:05.917 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING DISTRICTS.

02:27:04.683 --> 02:27:10.322 region:rollup2
AND THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS

02:27:05.917 --> 02:27:10.588 region:rollup2
BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS.

02:27:10.322 --> 02:27:12.424 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:27:10.588 --> 02:27:14.693 region:rollup2
.

02:27:12.424 --> 02:27:16.061 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE ONE MORE SPEAKER.

02:27:14.693 --> 02:27:18.596 region:rollup2
NO OKAY YOU ARE GREAT O. THAT

02:27:16.061 --> 02:27:21.366 region:rollup2
ARE QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL.

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:22.334 region:rollup2
LOOK AT.

02:27:21.366 --> 02:27:23.501 region:rollup2
FRESNO APPRECIATIVE RUNS.

02:27:22.334 --> 02:27:24.936 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL.

02:27:23.501 --> 02:27:26.638 region:rollup2
PRESENTATIONS I'M.

02:27:24.936 --> 02:27:27.939 region:rollup2
LET ME JUST START BY ASKING THE

02:27:26.638 --> 02:27:29.841 region:rollup2
FOLKS FROM THE PART OF FINANCE

02:27:27.939 --> 02:27:32.310 region:rollup2
DO YOU DO YOU HAVE.

02:27:29.841 --> 02:27:33.044 region:rollup2
I'M SURE YOU DO HAVE THOUGHTS.

02:27:32.310 --> 02:27:34.212 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATE ALEJO'S

02:27:33.044 --> 02:27:35.580 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS WHAT WHAT ARE

02:27:34.212 --> 02:27:38.216 region:rollup2
YOUR REACTIONS TO THEIR

02:27:35.580 --> 02:27:38.950 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS SURE YEAH. SO I THINK

02:27:38.216 --> 02:27:41.920 region:rollup2
ON.

02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:43.888 region:rollup2
THE UTILIZING THAT THE

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:46.424 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE TO IDENTIFY.

02:27:43.888 --> 02:27:47.425 region:rollup2
THAT EXPERTS

02:27:46.424 --> 02:27:48.660 region:rollup2
TO COME IN AND PROVIDE SUPPORT

02:27:47.425 --> 02:27:49.994 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF ISSUES

02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:52.831 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WITH THAT.

02:27:49.994 --> 02:27:54.065 region:rollup2
ONE THE EL CAP IS RELIEVED THE

02:27:52.831 --> 02:27:57.435 region:rollup2
CENTERPIECE OF OUR

02:27:54.065 --> 02:27:58.903 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IT'S WHERE

02:27:57.435 --> 02:28:00.405 region:rollup2
I'M COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOL

02:27:58.903 --> 02:28:01.473 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS COME TOGETHER AND

02:28:00.405 --> 02:28:03.374 region:rollup2
DISCUSS.

02:28:01.473 --> 02:28:04.776 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD RESULTS AND WHAT THEY

02:28:03.374 --> 02:28:05.343 region:rollup2
WANT TO DO WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES

02:28:04.776 --> 02:28:06.811 region:rollup2
ARE WHAT THEY WANTED YOU TO

02:28:05.343 --> 02:28:08.713 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

02:28:06.811 --> 02:28:10.548 region:rollup2
I'M ANY SHORTCOMINGS THEY HAVE.

02:28:08.713 --> 02:28:12.016 region:rollup2
AND. THE COUNTY OFFICES OF

02:28:10.548 --> 02:28:13.685 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

02:28:12.016 --> 02:28:14.819 region:rollup2
PARTNER IN ALL OF THAT. ON

02:28:13.685 --> 02:28:16.187 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO

02:28:14.819 --> 02:28:19.591 region:rollup2
ARE PROVING THE PLANS.

02:28:16.187 --> 02:28:21.259 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT.

02:28:19.591 --> 02:28:23.561 region:rollup2
S.. MAKING THE COUNTY OFFICE OF

02:28:21.259 --> 02:28:24.362 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ROLE I'M SIMPLY TO

02:28:23.561 --> 02:28:26.364 region:rollup2
INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN THE

02:28:24.362 --> 02:28:27.932 region:rollup2
RECALLS ANALYSIS REALLY DIVORCES

02:28:26.364 --> 02:28:29.367 region:rollup2
THEM FROM THE PROCESS OF

02:28:27.932 --> 02:28:31.336 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING SOLUTIONS.

02:28:29.367 --> 02:28:33.772 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A REALLY KEY

02:28:31.336 --> 02:28:34.839 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF THE EL CAP AND WHAT

02:28:33.772 --> 02:28:37.008 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY HAS TO APPROVE SO WE

02:28:34.839 --> 02:28:39.878 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE.

02:28:37.008 --> 02:28:41.579 region:rollup2
WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED THAT

02:28:39.878 --> 02:28:44.516 region:rollup2
BRINGING IN THE SHORT TERM PANEL

02:28:41.579 --> 02:28:46.217 region:rollup2
OF EXPERTS ON DOESN'T REALLY GET

02:28:44.516 --> 02:28:48.153 region:rollup2
THAT LONG TERM CHANGE ISSUE THAT

02:28:46.217 --> 02:28:49.988 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AND SO

02:28:48.153 --> 02:28:51.790 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THAT.

02:28:49.988 --> 02:28:53.057 region:rollup2
FINALLY I THINK.

02:28:51.790 --> 02:28:54.526 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW WE WERE TALKING

02:28:53.057 --> 02:28:56.661 region:rollup2
ABOUT RICK CAUSE ANALYSIS AND

02:28:54.526 --> 02:28:57.762 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING I'M A SOLUTION I

02:28:56.661 --> 02:28:59.531 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S WE THINK IT'S VERY

02:28:57.762 --> 02:29:00.832 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT AS. WE'RE LOOKING

02:28:59.531 --> 02:29:02.500 region:rollup2
AT THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

02:29:00.832 --> 02:29:03.168 region:rollup2
MODEL THAT WE'RE NOT.

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:04.269 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT BRINGING IN DIFFERENT

02:29:03.168 --> 02:29:05.737 region:rollup2
ENTITIES FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT

02:29:04.269 --> 02:29:06.304 region:rollup2
PARTS THOSE TWO THINGS ARE NOT

02:29:05.737 --> 02:29:10.241 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY. SEPARATE PIECES

02:29:06.304 --> 02:29:10.909 region:rollup2
BAD.

02:29:10.241 --> 02:29:12.443 region:rollup2
THE TEAM SHOULD BE WORKING ON

02:29:10.909 --> 02:29:15.246 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING THE ROOT CAUSES AS

02:29:12.443 --> 02:29:16.481 region:rollup2
WELL AS. WORKING ON FACILITATING

02:29:15.246 --> 02:29:18.917 region:rollup2
ON A CREATION OF THE PROPOSED

02:29:16.481 --> 02:29:19.884 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS AS ONE PROCESS

02:29:18.917 --> 02:29:24.055 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE THREE OF THE THE

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:25.223 region:rollup2
BIG ISSUES.

02:29:24.055 --> 02:29:28.660 region:rollup2
SO WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING LIKE

02:29:25.223 --> 02:29:31.262 region:rollup2
WITH THAT BUDGET NEGOTIATION

02:29:28.660 --> 02:29:32.430 region:rollup2
OVER THIS DID DO YOU GUYS END OF

02:29:31.262 --> 02:29:34.699 region:rollup2
SAY THE OTHERS IT IS YOU GET

02:29:32.430 --> 02:29:35.600 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED OUT. AMONGST.

SENATORS WITH.

02:29:35.934 --> 02:29:38.436 region:rollup2

DIRECTLY WITH YOU ARE HAPPY JUST

02:29:38.436 --> 02:29:45.844 region:rollup2
STRUCTURALLY HOW. THIS SORT OF.

02:29:43.908 --> 02:29:47.178 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE THE VISIONS AS TO HOW

02:29:45.844 --> 02:29:48.213 region:rollup2
WE OUGHTA.

02:29:47.178 --> 02:29:50.782 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE THAT THE RECENTLY

02:29:48.213 --> 02:29:52.984 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

02:29:50.782 --> 02:29:55.220 region:rollup2
HOW THAT PLAY OUT NOW OVER THE

02:29:52.984 --> 02:29:56.254 region:rollup2
NEXT COUPLE MONTHS?

02:29:55.220 --> 02:29:57.222 region:rollup2
AB WILL CERTAINLY AND WE STILL

02:29:56.254 --> 02:29:58.289 region:rollup2
HAVE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS ON ON

02:29:57.222 --> 02:30:00.258 region:rollup2
THIS TOPIC.

02:29:58.289 --> 02:30:03.728 region:rollup2
YET TO COME.

02:30:00.258 --> 02:30:04.262 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WE PROPOSE WE PRESENT

02:30:03.728 --> 02:30:05.463 region:rollup2
OUR PROPOSAL DELEO PRESENT

02:30:04.262 --> 02:30:06.064 region:rollup2
THERE'S AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN

02:30:05.463 --> 02:30:08.600 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO.

02:30:06.064 --> 02:30:10.869 region:rollup2
PROPOSED ITS OWN LANGUAGE M.

02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:11.936 region:rollup2
AND HOW IT THINKS THE SYSTEM OF

02:30:10.869 --> 02:30:14.105 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SHOULD LOOK.

02:30:11.936 --> 02:30:15.807 region:rollup2
BUT CERTAINLY YOUR PREROGATIVE

02:30:14.105 --> 02:30:16.541 region:rollup2
AND AND YOU KNOW ONE THAT WE'RE

02:30:15.807 --> 02:30:17.141 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO HAVE AS AN

02:30:16.541 --> 02:30:19.077 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION WERE HAPPY TO

02:30:17.141 --> 02:30:20.378 region:rollup2
