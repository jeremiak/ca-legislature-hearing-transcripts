JUST A- ONE LAST THING I DIDN'T

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:34.292

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:36.828
REGARDING IF SOMEBODY. SOMEHOW

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:38.396

COULDN'T LIVE HERE IN THE PAST

00:26:43.568 --> 00:26:45.770

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:47.539
THAT INFORMATION IS IT IS IT

00:26:47.605 --> 00:26:48.740
OPTIONAL THAT SOMEBODY COULD

CAN DO IT ON THEIR OWN RIGHT

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:06.758
NOW TO REMOVE IT OKAY BUT WHEN

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:08.660
THEY DO REMOVE IT IT'S STILL ON

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:11.262
THE BACK DEED WITH THE COUNTY

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:13.064
IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT I SAID

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.532
IF YOU PULL UP A BILL TODAY

00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:16.201
THAT'S BEEN AMENDED YOU SEE THE

00:27:16.267 --> 00:27:17.435
CURRENT VERSION YOU CAN GO LOOK

00:27:17.502 --> 00:27:19.104
AT THE MASSIVE CHANGES WITHOUT

YOUR BILL PEOPLE COULD REMOVE

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:21.539
RESTRICTIVE COVENANT LANGUAGE

00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:22.707
FROM THE ORIGINAL DATE CORRECT

00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:23.942
THEY CAN DO TODAY AND THE FACT

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:25.777
THAT HALF OF THE BILL. WE WANT

00:27:25.844 --> 00:27:28.046
TO MAKE IT EASIER WAY THERE WAS

00:27:28.113 --> 00:27:29.214
A PRIOR BILL ABOUT TEN YEARS

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.448
AGO WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO DO

00:27:30.515 --> 00:27:32.350
IT IN ONE COUNTY IS DIFFERENT

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:33.785
THE OTHER COUNTIES SO IT'S NOT

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:35.053
COMPLICATED HER FROM THE FIRST

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.855
WITNESS THEY CAN DO IT BUT IT'S

00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:38.923
NOT ALWAYS A MISSING WAS

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.091
PROCESS SO WE WANT TO DO TWO

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:43.294
THINGS ONE MAKE IT SO IT'S- CUT

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:44.562
OUT THE RED TAPES YOU OUGHT TO

00:27:44.629 --> 00:27:46.431
GET MULTIPLE NOTARIES TO DO IT

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:47.766
ON YOUR OWN AND WE WAIVE THE

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:49.100
FEES FOR THAT AND WE'VE AGREED

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:50.502
TO THAT OKAY THE SECOND THING

00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:51.870
IS THERE'S MASSES THAT DON'T

00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:52.937
EVEN KNOW ABOUT. IN THE FIRST

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:54.773
PLACE SO THAT PART OF THIS BILL

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.007
IS THAT WE WOULD CREATE THIS

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:58.410
FIND WE WOULD IDENTIFY AND MAP

00:27:58.476 --> 00:27:59.844
THEM AND THEN WE CAN REMOVE

00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:02.080
THEM AT LARGE SLOTS BUT TO YOUR

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:03.248
POINT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:04.616
THEY'RE AT AND MAYBE HAVE

00:28:04.682 --> 00:28:06.084
PUBLIC POLICY TO PUT MORE

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:07.285
RESOURCES IN AREAS WHICH DID

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:09.721
HAVE- A CONCENTRATION OF THESE

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:11.523
CABINS BUT IF AN INDIVIDUAL

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:14.059
WANTED TO SEE THAT STILL. THAT

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:16.594
RECORD WOULD STILL EXISTS FOR

00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:18.163
ETERNITY THEY COULD GO AND FIND

00:28:18.229 --> 00:28:19.397
IT AT THE COUNTY RECORDS AND

00:28:19.464 --> 00:28:20.698
HAVE THAT STUFF SO WHAT YOU'RE

00:28:20.765 --> 00:28:22.500
SAYING IS THAT THEY CAN APPLY

00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:24.502
FOR THIS OPTIONALLY CONTINUING

00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:25.937

GO AND MAP ALL THESE ONE NIGHT

00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:41.486
ONE THING THAT I THINK THAT

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:42.854
THAT WE WOULD WANT TO DO IS

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:44.823
CLICK REMOVE A MALL IN MASS

00:28:44.889 --> 00:28:46.558
LIKE A CERTAIN AREA AND SOME

00:28:46.624 --> 00:28:48.059
PART OF SAN DIEGO MAYBE THERE'S

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:50.462
A COMMUNITY THERE WITH THREE

00:28:50.528 --> 00:28:51.029
THOUSAND HOMES AND THEY ALL

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:53.164
HAVE I- BUT I GUESS WHAT YOUR

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:54.032
POINT IS IT WOULD AFFECT

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:56.101
INDIVIDUAL WANTED TO. SOMEHOW

ABLE TO BUY THIS HOUSE ON A

00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:04.943
HILL AND HERE WE ARE TODAY- THE

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:06.744
POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE IS

00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:08.546
THAT THEY WOULD STILL BE ABLE

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:10.849
TO IDENTIFY THAT RESTRICTIVE

00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:12.817

IMPLEMENTATION OF FEES IS THAT

00:29:26.664 --> 00:29:28.666
