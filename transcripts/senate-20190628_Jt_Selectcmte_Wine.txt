TO HAVE YOU ON CAMPUS FOR THIS JOINT SENATE AND ASSEMBLY HEARING. HERE IT'S ENORMOUS DAY WE WORK REALLY HARD TO REUSE AND RECYCLE THINGS AS MUCH AS WE CAN. AND THIS BEAUTIFUL WINE SPECTATOR LEARNING CENTER IS A WONDERFUL PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS THIS USED TO BE OUR OLD STUDENT UNION -- OUR CAFETERIA AND BOOKSTORE AND WHILE LOOK AT IT NOW IT STANDS AS A SYMBOL OF CINEMA STATES RECOGNITION. AS THE NATION'S PREMIER UNIVERSITY FOR THE STUDY AND RESEARCH OF THE BUSINESS OF WINE. WE HELD A RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY HERE. JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO. MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE FILLED THIS BEAUTIFUL CENTER AND OUT ON THE AREAS AROUND IT. AND TOOK PART IN THE CELEBRATION ON THAT DAY MANY OF YOU WERE ABLE TO JOIN US. WHAT I REMEMBER MOST ABOUT THAT SUNNY AFTERNOON WAS THE EXCITEMENT AND THE ANTICIPATION AND THE ENERGY? OF THE CROWD. THERE WERE SPEECHES. THERE WAS LAUGHTER AND OF COURSE THERE WAS CHAMPAGNE IN LINE. BUT MOST OF ALL IT WAS JOY AND ANTICIPATION. ANTICIPATION OF WHAT THIS FACILITY WHAT THIS BUILDING COULD DO FOR US. WE HOPED AND ENVISION THAT WHEN WE OPEN THE STORES. THAT THIS TYPE OF GATHERING WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE WOULD BECOME KNOWN FOR A PLACE TO EDUCATE. TO LEARN. AND MOST OF ALL TO GATHER AND TO GROW TOGETHER IN PURSUIT OF MAKING OUR WORLD A LITTLE SMALLER. A LITTLE SMARTER A LITTLE MORE CONNECTED MORE COLLABORATIVE MORE CARING MORE RESILIENT AND A BIT BETTER. AND FOR THAT. WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE TO OFFER THINGS AND TO GIVE CREDIT. THE WINE SPECTATOR LEARNING CENTER IS AN IDEA THAT WAS CONCEIVED YEARS AGO BY GARY HECK PRESIDENT AND OWNER OF CORBELL WINERY. PRESIDENT EMERITUS RUBEN ARMEN JANA AND MANY OTHERS WHO HAD THIS VISION. IT WAS AN IDEA THAT WAS BROUGHT TO FRUITION BY WINE SPECTATOR ANDY. EDITOR AND PUBLISHER MARVIN SHANKEN OUR WINE BUSINESS INSTITUTE BOARD MEMBERS AND OTHERS WHO'S GIVING WHOSE VISION AND PERSISTENCE MADE THIS ELEVEN MILLION DOLLAR RENOVATION. POSSIBLE. AND IT'S AN IDEA THAT IS VALIDATED AND ENRICHED BY YOUR PRESENCE HERE TODAY AND HAVING THIS HEARING HERE. THIS BUILDING IS HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY'S ONE BUSINESS INSTITUTE WHICH REPRESENTS A VERY UNIQUE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN OUR SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS. AND THE WINE INDUSTRY. THIS PARTNERSHIP HAS FOSTERED THE EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW WINE INDUSTRY LEADERS MANY OF WHOM I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET MANY OF OUR LOANS TODAY. IT'S STRENGTHEN TIES BETWEEN OUR UNIVERSITY THE WINE COUNTRY AND WINE LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD. AND THIS PARTNERSHIP HAS GIVEN RISE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE NEW PROGRAMS ONE PIONEERING INITIATIVE THAT I AM PARTICULARLY PROUD OF IS ONE THAT WE CALL OUR WINE INDUSTRY SCHOLARS PROGRAM. WHICH OFFERS SCHOLARSHIPS TO CHILDREN AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF VINEYARD AND WINERY WORKERS MANY OF WHOM ARE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS. SO THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE THIS THIS CENTER REFLECTS THE PILLARS OF CINEMA STATES NEWLY REVISED STRATEGIC PLAN. WITH PRIORITY SETTING FOOD STUDENT SUCCESS. LEADERSHIP CULTIVATION AND ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE AND INNOVATION. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK AND RECOGNISE OUR LOCAL LEGISLATIVE LEADERS ARE CO CHAIRS AND SHARE OF THIS CONVENING.

THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS HEARING TO CAMPUS MEANS A LOT. TO OUR VISION IS TO BE THE GLOBAL LEADER IN ONE BUSINESS RESEARCH AND EDUCATION HERE AT CINEMA STATE. AND THIS ALL GOT STARTED. YOU SEE BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TWENTY THREE YEARS AGO NOW -- WAS AN IDEA THAT WAS PUT FORWARD BY GERRY HECHO NORTH CORBELL IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR PRESENT AT THE TIME ARYANA. AND HE EXPLAINED A REAL NEED THAT WE HAD IN WIND AND THAT WAS PREPARING FOR SUCCESSION PLANNING WHO IS GOING TO LEAD THE NEXT GENERATION WHO WERE GOING TO TAKE OVER THE RUNNING OF THE WINERIES HERE IN THE NORTH COAST TO CONTINUE. THEIR SUCCESS IN A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET PLACE. SO HE RECRUITED WALL CLANS HE WAS RUNNING BERINGER AT THE TIME AND THEN ALSO HENRY TREE MONNING. THEY BILL TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS ONE IN APPLE ONE IN CINEMA WORKING TOGETHER ACROSS THE MIKE ON THIS MOUNTAIN. AND THAT GROUP. BECAME A GROUP OF TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SEVEN PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TODAY AND THEY REALLY PROVIDE THE STRATEGIC DIRECTION FOR OUR PROGRAMS OUR RESEARCH. AND ALL THE ACTIVITIES THAT TAKE PLACE HERE IN THE WINE BUSINESS INSTITUTE. YOU CAN SEE THE COMPANIES THAT THEY REPRESENT THEIR WINERIES LARGE AND SMALL BUT ALSO OTHER PEOPLE WORKING ALONG THE VALUE CHAIN -- IN ACCOUNTING IN THE LAW -- SERVICE IN THE INDUSTRY WITH PRODUCTS BEFORE THEY MAKE WINE AND SELLING AND MARKETING THE WINE AFTER ITS PRODUCE. THIS IS THE PUBLIC PART OF THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THE DOCTOR SAKAKI DESCRIBE OUR FACULTY FACULTY IN THE BUILDING SEASONED ACADEMICS WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF WINE BUSINESS RESEARCH. BUT ALSO. PRACTITIONERS FROM THE INDUSTRY -- WE HAVE A CLASS GOING TODAY WITH OUR EXECUTIVE ONE MBA STUDENTS AND ONE OF OUR FACULTY IS HERE HAD A LONG TERM. INTEREST AND ROLE IN HR AND THE WINE INDUSTRY TO BRING THAT EXPERTISE COUPLED WITH OUR ACADEMIC FACULTY IT'S JUST MAGIC SO. I MENTIONED THE VISION AND WE HAVE A BIG STAKE IN RESEARCH AND THE FACULTY HAS BEEN WORKING ON THAT AS WELL AS THE CURRICULUM THAT'S VERY FOCUSED ON INDUSTRY ISSUES. WHEN WE PRESENTED AT THE FINANCIAL SYMPOSIUM LAST FALL? THESE WERE THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT THE INDUSTRY IDENTIFIED AS MOST SALIENT AND MOST CRITICAL RIGHT NOW. IN THE ONE ON WORKFORCE CONTINUES IT'S CHALLENGING AND IT'S NOT THE COST OF LABOR IT'S JUST SIMPLY THE AVAILABILITY OF PEOPLE TO FILL THE ROLES THAT WE HAVE IN THE KNEES. OTHER THINGS AS WELL AND NATURAL DISASTERS HAS BECOME QUITE A CONCERN AND WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT A MORE ABOUT THAT TODAY. SO WE'RE GOING TO A LITTLE DEEPER DIVE INTO RESEARCH AND THAT'S TALK ABOUT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE NORTH COAST WILDFIRES THAT WE DID BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IF YOU WATCH THE COVERAGE IT WAS DEVASTATING -- MANY PEOPLE LOST HOMES LIVES BUILDINGS PROPERTY AND BUSINESSES WERE IMPACTED. BUT THE THE MISSTEP ON CNN AND OTHER PROVIDERS OF THE CONTENT. THEY GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE WINE INDUSTRY WAS CLOSE. AND THE BOARD GAVE US A CHARGE YES IN THE BOARD GAVE US THE CHARGE THEY SAID LOOK WE NEED TO DOCUMENT THE TRUTH. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT VINEYARDS WEREN'T BURNED REALLY A SMALL NUMBER IN A SMALL NUMBER OF WINERIES DISPLAY SO WE WENT OUT AND GOT THE NUMBERS WE FIND OUT THAT NINETY NINE POINT 8% OF VINEYARD ACRES IN THE NORTH COAST WERE UNAFFECTED BY THE FIRES. SO WE BEGAN -- PROCESS OF GETTING THAT WORD OUT THROUGH THE MEDIA AND THROUGH OUR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE INDUSTRY TO HELP WRITE THE SHIP ON THAT STORY BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY A DEVASTATING ECONOMIC IMPACT. TO HAVE THE TOURIST NOT COM. ANOTHER AREA THAT WE'VE WORKED ON OR THE COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS OF WINE BUSINESSES IN THE NORTH COAST. ALMOST TO A PERSON PEOPLE REALLY LIKE WINE IN THIS AREA THEY LIVE HERE THEY TAKE THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO VISIT WINERIES THEY LOVE THE P. CALL LIKE ASPECT OF THE VINEYARDS -- IT'S PRETTY BEAUTIFUL -- WE LIVE IN A GREAT REGION THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE NORTH COAST. THE MIKE CAME HE'S GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT LATER FROM THIS NUMBER CONNIE VENDORS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES LOCALLY SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WANT TO START A NEW WINE BUSINESS. YOU WANT TO PUT IN THE NEW VINEYARD OR PERHAPS MODIFYING EXISTING PERMIT IT CAME IF YOU WERE AT SOME OF THE HEARINGS YOU THINK THAT ONE WAS BIG OIL. AND THERE'S A LOT OF HYPERBOLE THROWN AROUND. YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN. THEN. SO THIS WASN'T. SO AGAIN THE BOARD TASKED US WITH HE THAT'S GET THE FACTS ON THIS AND SO WE COMMISSIONED A STUDY WE DID THE RESEARCH AND HERE'S WHAT WE FOUND. 7474% OF RESIDENTS IN THE NORTH COAST HAVE A VERY POSITIVE IMPRESSION OF THE WINE INDUSTRY 4% NEGATIVE. AND WE DON'T SEE THOSE KIND OF NUMBERS ON ANYTHING SEVENTY FOUR VERSUS FOUR THEY HAD A LITTLE SLICE IN THE MIDDLE THAT'S JUST FINE EVERYTHING'S MEN'S THE MEN'S. SO THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO DOCUMENT. AND THAT HAS BEEN A HELP TO LOCAL PEOPLE -- AND LOCAL LEADERS LIKE MIKE IN CARRYING THE MESSAGE FORWARD AT PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS -- ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING TO DOCUMENT HAS BEEN THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE WINE INDUSTRY AND WHAT A CRUCIAL ROLE THEY CRY THEY PLAY IN JOB CREATION NOT ONLY IN WINERIES. AND VINEYARDS BUT ALSO THROUGH THE WHOLE VALUE CHAIN OF CHANGE THAT IS SUPPORTED BY THE SUCCESS OF THIS INDUSTRY. AND THE PUBLIC RECOGNIZES IT AND ALSO THE PUBLIC RECOGNIZES HOW PHILANTHROPIC WINE INDUSTRY IS. IT'S A IT'S AN AMAZING VIRTUOUS CIRCLE YOU SEE OF GIVING WHERE. COAST SPECIFICALLY TARGET THEY'RE GIVING TO THE LOCAL INTERESTS VERY VERY LOCALLY MINDED. AND DR SAKAKI MENTIONED THE WINE INDUSTRY SCHOLARS PROGRAM. ALREADY OVER THREE MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO THAT PROGRAM THAT PROGRAM DIRECTLY SUPPORTS FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO STUDY ONE THEY CAN STUDY WHATEVER THEY WANT. BUT WE WANT PEOPLE WHO'VE WHOSE PARENTS HAVE WORKED IN WINE YOU'VE WORKED IN AGRICULTURE MORE BROADLY WE WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET AN EDUCATION WHATEVER THEY CHOOSE TO STUDY HERE IT'S AND I'M A STATE. IT'S REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE. AND THEN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS WE HAD A REPORTED ARE NOVEMBER BOARD MEETING FROM SOME OF THE FACULTY AND IT WAS IT WAS STARTLING -- THEY WENT ON AND DOCUMENTED THE PREPAREDNESS OR UNDER PREPAREDNESS OF MANY -- IN THE WINE BUSINESS AND THIS IS IN THE FALL BUT IT'S JUST -- WE'RE NOT READY FOR EVERY EVERY TRAGEDY THAT CAN COME OUR WAY AND THEY DOCUMENTED THE BEST PRACTICES AND SOME OF THE BEST CASES THAT THEY FOUND WITH WINERIES ARE DOING IT REALLY WELL. AND AT OUR SUMMIT ON JULY TENTH HERE OR RESEARCH SUMMIT WE'RE GONNA PRESENT THOSE FINDINGS WE'RE GONNA SHARE THEM WITH THE INDUSTRY AND PROVIDE TAKEN MATERIALS THAT PEOPLE CAN PUT TO WORK. AT THEIR ONE BUSINESSES IN VINEYARDS. AND IT SPEAKS TO SOMETHING THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT OUR MAY MEETING ASKED ME TO BRING FORWARD THEY GAVE ME THIS CHARGE. ASK OUR LEGISLATORS IF THEY WOULD HELP SUPPORT SOME OF THIS RESEARCH THAT WE'RE DOING ONE ONE BUSINESS. AND SO THAT IS MY ASK FOR YOU TODAY IF WE COULD WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY -- FINDING WHETHER IT'S THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS OR PERHAPS CONNECTION THE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS IN SACRAMENTO THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT SOME OF THIS RESEARCH THAT WE'RE DOING SPECIFICALLY ON THE BUSINESS OF WINE. THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING WE COULD DO [INAUDIBLE] OKAY. THANK YOU THAT IS AWESOME. WELL I APPRECIATED. ALL BOY AND AGAIN YOU KNOW OUR VISION. IT'S TWO FOLD IT'S ON RESEARCH BUT ALSO ON PROGRAMS SO LET'S TURN TO THE PROGRAMS FOR A MINUTE. WE STARTED OUR BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN WINE BUSINESS FIRST ONE IN THE HEMISPHERE FIRST WHEN THE UNITED STATES AND OF COURSE THE WHOLE HEMISPHERE WE STARTED A GRADUATE DEGREE IN ONE BUSINESS. AND TODAY OUR FLAGSHIP PROGRAM IS THIS OUR EXECUTIVE ONE NBA YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM TWO OF OUR ALUMNI FROM THE PROGRAM TODAY THIS IS THE GROUP THAT GRADUATED LAST SUMMER. AND IT'S AMAZING THE CAREERS THAT THEY'RE DEVELOPING. THEY THEY EXPERIENCE THE WORLD ON OUR INTERNATIONAL TRIP -- THIS PAST MARCH WE WERE IN -- EUROPE WITH THE CURRENT GROUP OF STUDENTS THEY WERE LOOKING AT HOW ONE BUSINESS IS DONE THE CHALLENGES IN FRANCE THE CHALLENGES IN GREECE -- THE OPPORTUNITIES IN BOTH OF WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM SOMEBODY WHO'S IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PARADIGM -- WE GO SAILING TOGETHER ON THE SAN DIEGO BAY AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN LEADERSHIP SKILLS IS TREMENDOUS WHEN YOU HAVE TO SAIL A SHIP TOGETHER WITH OTHER PEOPLE. YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE ONE ROCKSTAR EVERYBODY'S GOT A POOL THEIR PART. IT'S QUITE A PROGRAM AND I WANNA LET YOU KNOW WE'RE IN ROLLING RIGHT NOW FOR THE NEXT ITERATION IN THIS GRADUATE PROGRAM THAT'S OUR GLOBAL ONE NBA. IT'S A BLEND OF ON CAMPUS BUT A LOT OF ONLINE OPPORTUNITY WHICH WILL MAKE THE PROGRAM ACCESSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WITH A GREATER DISTANCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME HERE TODAY APPRECIATE [INAUDIBLE] OKAY [INAUDIBLE] OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- TO ALL THREE OF YOU FOR INVITING ME TO BE HERE -- SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO TODAY IS SPEND A FEW MINUTES TO BRING YOU UP TO DATE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE NO G. YOU C. DAVIS -- ORDERS VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO WORK WE JUST TALKED ABOUT -- WE FOCUS MUCH MORE ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THINGS -- IS THERE FOCUSING MORE ON THE BUSINESS -- JUST BRIEFLY UC DAVIS -- AS I THINK OF YOU KNOW IS -- IS PART OF THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. IT'S THE LAND GRANT -- ONE OF THE MAIN LINGERING CAMPUSES IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THE KEY THING IS HERE TO KEEP THINGS ONE IS IT'S IT IS THE TOP. PROGRAM IN AGRICULTURE IN THE COUNTRY ONE OF THE TOP. TWO IN THE WORLD PROBABLY. AND THAT MEANS THAT WHILE I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE DEPARTMENT VITICULTURE ANALOGY -- THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE RESEARCHERS STUDENTS FOCUSED ON AGRICULTURE IN GENERAL IS MUCH BROADER THAN IN OUR DEPARTMENT AND WE TAKE ADVANTAGE THAT ALONG THE WAY AS WELL. THE THE HISTORY OF OUR DEPARTMENT STARTS ACTUALLY IN IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AND IT STARTS WITH THE ACT FROM YOU FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE -- BECAUSE AT THAT POINT THE STATE ALREADY KNEW THE GRAPES ONE WE'RE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO THEY DECIDED THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE A PLACE TO TRAIN -- TRAIN PEOPLE TO GROW GRAPES AND MAKE. ONE COURSE AT THAT POINT THE ONLY CAMPUS SERVES UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA WAS A BERKELEY AND THE DEPARTMENT STARTED THERE IN -- EIGHTEEN EIGHTY IT SUPPORTED THE GROWTH OF THE THAT FIRST KIND OF GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRY AND THE THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. AND THEN -- AFTER THE END OF PROHIBITION MOVED OUT TO DAVIS WORDED IT'S BEEN SENSE -- AND IS IS REALLY CREDITED FIRST -- HELPING THE INDUSTRY TO RECOVER FROM PROHIBITION AND TO REGAIN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS LOST DURING THOSE THIRTEEN YEARS. THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAS COME UP WITH NEW KNOWLEDGE NEW TECHNOLOGY -- AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY TRAINED STUDENTS THAT GO OUT INTO INDUSTRY -- FOR MANY YEARS NOW -- THROUGH THE END OF PROHIBITION AND THEN THROUGH THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WERE THERE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES WERE. FEWER THAN A HUNDRED WINERIES TO PRESENT DAY WHERE THERE'S NO MORE THAN FORTY FIVE HUNDRED WINERIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND OUR OUR DEPARTMENT HAS HELPED. TO TWO FOR FUEL AND SUPPORT THEIR GROWTH. WE DO THAT WITH THREE A CORE MISSIONS -- THAT'S TEACHING RESEARCH AND EXTENSION AND I LIKE TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES TALKING ABOUT EACH OF THESE BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE ALL ALL THREE OF THESE ARE IMPORTANT. IN -- AND HELPING THE INDUSTRY TO BE STRONG AND TO GROW IN THE WAY IT WOULD LIKE. TO AND SPORT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT COME FROM INDUSTRY AS WELL. SO START WITH RESEARCH -- WE HAVE A SIXTEEN FACULTY MEMBERS IN THE DEPARTMENT -- THE COVER A WIDE RANGE OF DISCIPLINE ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES MY BACKGROUND IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND WE HAVE A FEW CHEMICAL ENGINEERS BUT WE ALSO CHEMISTS AND MICROBIOLOGISTS. AND CENTURY SCIENTIST AND A WHOLE RANGE OF PLANT BIOLOGISTS FROM VERY BASIC TO REPLY HAVING THIS [INAUDIBLE] THIS. KIND OF GROUP OF ACADEMICS IN ONE DEPARTMENT IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY UNIQUE IN THE WORLD. AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY OUR DEPARTMENT. IS -- CONSISTENTLY THOUGHT OF AS THE TOP PROGRAM IN GRAPE GROWING WINEMAKING IN THE WORLD -- THESE ARE THE KIND OF DISCIPLINES THAT YOU NEED TO SOLVE. IMPORTANT PROBLEMS THAT ARE FACING THE INDUSTRY THAT ARE EITHER ACUTE PROBLEMS OR CHRONIC PROBLEMS. THAT NEED CONSTANT TENSION. THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE -- USING WATER EFFICIENTLY WATER CALIFORNIA IS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE ISSUE. IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN -- AND WE HAVE RESEARCHERS ARE WORKING ON NEW WAYS OF USING WATER EFFICIENTLY WHETHER IT'S THROUGH NEW PLANTS. FOR NEW WAYS OF DISTRIBUTING WATER THROUGH THEN YOU'RE. BUT ALSO LONG TERM PROBLEMS LIKE DISEASES AND CONTROLLING DISEASES AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL. MORE RECENTLY WE'VE HAD A HUGE ISSUES WITH THE WILDFIRES AS RICK MENTIONED. AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER. WHEN THOSE PROBLEMS STARTED HAPPENING AND AND -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NEED OVER HOLSTER WHO'S THE PERSON IN THE MASK ON THE RATE THAT PICTURE. WAS OUR EXTENSION I'LL JUST JUMP RIGHT IN TO USE THAT TRAGEDY AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY STUDY WAYS OF MITIGATING SMOKE TAINTED. ONE WHERE AS WE GO AROUND THE STATE WE LOOK FOR WHAT ARE THE CRITICAL ISSUES FACING ONE MYSTERY FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS WATER. AND WATER IN WATER AND WATER -- JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS I THINK LABOR HAS SURPASSED THAT ISSUE AS THE KEY ISSUE ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF ONE ACHING. AND SORE DRESSING AS WELL THROUGH -- AUTOMATION AND MECHANIZATION. THE IMPACT OF WHAT WE DO FOR RESEARCH -- WE'VE STUDIED WITH -- COLLEAGUES ON A CULTURAL ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT YOU C. DAVIS. IT'S TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WILL COME OUT OF THE RESEARCH -- FROM OUR DEPARTMENT AND THIS KIND OF INVESTMENT -- AS RE WAS SAYING KIND OF INVESTMENT WHETHER IT'S FROM THE INDUSTRY MITCHELL HERE ABOUT MORRELL A BIT. MORE FROM THE STATE WE'RE WHEN THAT'S BEEN AVAILABLE HAS BEEN HUGE THE PAY BACK IS HUGE AND RESEARCH -- TOWARDS THE THE WELL BEING OF THE THE INDUSTRY AND THE STATE. WITHOUT ONE OF THE OTHER KEY MISSIONS THAT WE HAVE IS TEACHING AND TRAINING STUDENTS TO BE IN THE INDUSTRY. WE OFFER BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND A MASTER'S DEGREE BOTH OF THE CULTURE AND OLOGY. A BACHELORS DEGREE GRADUATES ABOUT FORTY FIVE STUDENTS YEAR AND A MASTER'S DEGREE -- GRADUATES ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY STUDENTS HERE. WELL THESE PROGRAMS HAVE A CORE BASE -- CORE OF BASIC SCIENCE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE TRAINED IN BASIC SCIENCE BEFORE THE HAVE INTENSIVE TRAINING. AND THE CULTURE ANALOGY -- THIS TRAINING IS HANDS ON AND WHAT WE REALLY WANT FOR GRADUATES IS TO BE. TO HAVE THE TOOL BOX THAT LETS THEM GO OUT AND BE CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVERS. THE HANDS ON EXPERIENCES IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE TEACH -- IT'S A HANDS ON INDUSTRY AND STUDENTS NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING BEFORE THEY GET OUT TO INDUSTRY -- SO WHETHER IT'S IN THE CHEMISTRY LAB IS SHOWN HERE ANALYZING ONCE CHEMICALLY. WE'RE LEARNING HOW TO ESTABLISH WHEN YOURS IS YOU SEE HERE. FOR PRUNING IN THE VINEYARD ALL OF OUR COURSES HAVE SOME KIND OF PRACTICAL ASPECT TO IT HERE IN THE WINERY -- WHERE STUDENTS ARE LEARNING IN THE VINEYARD AND IN THE WINERY AND IN THE LAB HOW TO DO THE JOBS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING -- SHORTLY AS THEY ENTER THE INDUSTRY. I SHOULD SAY THAT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO NOTE THAT THE STUDENTS ARE STUDENTS BECOME EMPLOYEES AT VINEYARDS AND WINERIES AROUND THE STATE. AND WE ALSO VIRTUALLY BECOME VINEYARD OWNERS AND WINERY OWNERS AROUND THE STATE AND ADD TO THE HUGE ECONOMIC IMPACT. WITH ONE STREET HAS ON ON CALIFORNIA AND ON THE COUNTRY. THE THIRD PART OF THIRD CORE MISSION THAT WE HAVE IS EXTENSION AND THAT'S THE IDEA OF CONTINUING EDUCATION -- IF WE JUST DO RESEARCH AND WE DON'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT IT DOESN'T REALLY DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY FOCUS ON IS HOW TO GET THIS INFORMATION. TO STAKEHOLDERS THAT NEED. AND SO WE HAVE A DEDICATED TEAM THAT DOES THAT WE RUN ABOUT FIFTEEN OR MAYBE MORE -- CONTINUE EDUCATION PROGRAMS A YEAR -- THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SCEPTRE HARVEST WE KNOW NOBODY'S GONNA GO -- AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THOSE AROUND CAMPUS AND ONE THIRD WE TRAVEL AROUND THE STATE TO THE MAIN GROWING REGIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REACHING ALL THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THAT INFORMATION THE STATE. THIS IS SPECIALLY IMPORTANT -- TO NOW IS -- THERE'S SOME TRANSITION AND UC ANR AND THE I. IN THERE ARE SOME KEY -- SOME KEY -- GROWING AREAS IN THE STATE THE HAVE HAD RETIREMENTS OF THE FOREMAN VISORS IN THOSE FORMER VISORS HAVE NOT YET BEEN REPLACED SINCE NOT CLEAR WHEN OR IF THEY WILL BE. IT IS A KEY ISSUE THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED -- BECAUSE THAT IS A KEY PART OF THE EXTENSION TO TURN CONTINUING THE CUSTOMER FACULTY. THROUGH -- THROUGH OUR CORPORATE EXTENSION SPECIALIST TO FARM ADVISORS IN THE STATE. ARE WE ALSO HAVE GREAT FACILITIES -- THIS IS A PICTURE OF OUR TEACHING RESEARCH WINERY I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE SEEN MAYBE ALL THE CERTAINLY INVITE YOU TO COME IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT. IT'S THE MOST ADVANCED THE MOST SUSTAINABLE WINERY IN THE WORLD -- INTEL RECENTLY WAS THE ONLY LEED PLATINUM CERTIFIED ONE OR THE WORLD TO KNOW -- SILVER OKAY HAS TWO ONE IN OAKVILLE AND THE ONE HERE IN SONOMA -- VERY PROUD THAT THEIR PARTNERS WITH JOSH AND HAVE MUCH SCOTIANS WITH US -- ENTER WELL AS THEY'VE BEEN DESIGNING THEIR FACILITIES. I THINK THAT'S GREAT. I SHOULD MENTION AT THIS FACILITY BETWEEN THE BUILDING AND THE EQUIPMENT WAS ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS -- PRIVATELY FUNDED THERE WAS NO STATE MONEY PUT INTO THE M. OPEN UP ONE OTHER KEY FACILITY ONE TALK ABOUT IS THAT -- FOLKS FOR MENTAL STATION. AND FILL IN NAPA VALLEY -- THIS IS A THERE ARE VERY FEW -- FIFTY UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD WHO HAVE. VINEYARDS IN REALLY KEY GROWING REGIONS SO WE'RE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE HAD THIS SINCE -- ABOUT -- NINETEEN FIFTY N.. REALLY IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE IS COMING OUT OF THERE FROM -- PERMITS AND WE NOW HAVE A PROPER EXTENSION SPECIALIST CONFERRAL WHO STATION. SO WITH THAT I JUST LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT I THINK THERE'S IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT THE TOP GROWING REGIONS -- PRODUCING REGIONS OF THE WORLD. ALSO HAVE SOME OF THE TOP ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN THE WORLD SUPPORTING THEM AND APPRECIATE. OF ALL THE SUPPORT THAT WE GET FROM INDUSTRY AND FROM THE STATE -- M. M. CERTAINLY -- WE HOPE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A STRONG PROGRAM THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M NOW ALL HAVE CLEAR HOW DIFFERENT CFO FROM MONDAY NGUYEN FAMILY WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TODAY. I AM PROUD TO BE ABLE TO BRAG A BIT ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE ON THE EXECUTIVE MBA COURSE -- WHICH I STARTED IN MARCH OF SEVENTEEN AND GRADUATED LAST AUGUST -- SO AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL I'M NOT FROM THIS REGION AND WHEN I ARRIVED INTO THE U. S. I WAS FEELING PRETTY CHUFFED WITH MYSELF. I HAD TWENTY YEARS OF FINANCE EXPERIENCE. I WAS FROM -- PWC BACKGROUND -- TRANSFERRED TO NEW ZEALAND FROM THE U. K. WITH THEM. AND THEN MOVED INTO A VARIETY OF COMMERCIAL ROLES. LASTLY IN NEW ZEALAND -- FOR TREASURY WINE ESTATES IN OAKLAND. I TRANSFERRED WITH THEM SO THAT ADDED TO MY RANGE OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE IN THE U. K. AFRICA. NEW ZEALAND AUSTRALIA -- AND I HAD BEEN WORKING AT A SENIOR EXECUTIVE LEVEL FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS INCLUDING BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR TREASURY WINE ESTATES IN NEW ZEALAND. BUT WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT I WAS REALLY PLATEAUED AT A CONTROLLER SLASH. FINANCE DIRECTOR LEVEL AND WHEN I WAS APPLYING FOR ROLES IT SEEMS THAT. I WAS EQUIVALENT IN MANY WAYS APART FROM THE LACK OF A ANDY A PROGRAM. SO I DECIDED THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO -- ADD A FEATHER TO MY CAT. AND AS SOON AS I WAS INTRODUCED TO THE EXECUTIVE WINE MBA PROGRAM AT CINEMA STATE MY SEARCH BASICALLY FINISHED. I KNEW THAT WIND WAS THE CAREER THAT I'VE BEEN SEARCHING. FOR I WANTED -- TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE AND MY BOTH OF MY OWN. REALM OF FINANCE BUT ALSO HAVE EXPOSURE TO OTHER COHORT MEMBERS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF CAREERS -- AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT -- I WAS LOOKING FOR PERSONAL GROWTH AND NETWORKING NOT NEXT WORKING JUST WITH MY COHORT MEMBERS BUT ALSO WITH THE FACULTY. AND AND AT JOHN PROFESSES -- AND I'D PROBABLY BE REMISS IF I WASN'T TO SAY THAT I REALLY JUST WANT TO THAT CERTIFICATE ALSO -- TO LATE LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WOULD COME ABOUT. SO WHY ONE NBA -- CINEMA STATE REALLY HAD FOR ME A POINT OF DIFFERENTIATION -- BEING THE BUSINESS OF WINE I KNEW THAT THIS BUILDING WAS GOING TO BE COMPLETED IN MY TIME HERE. AND WAS LOOKING FOR TO THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT LATER THAN I'D HOPED I I DID SPEND MY LAST SEMESTER -- IN THIS BUILDING AND GRADUATED IN THIS ROOM -- I WAS DEFINITELY OFFERED TO WERE NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES -- AT EVERY LEVEL WITH THE FACULTY HERE -- WITH THE JOHN PROFESSES WITH MY MY UNKNOWN COHORT -- SO I REALLY FELT THAT I HAD A GREAT. A NETWORK OF FUTURE LEADERS IN THE WINE INDUSTRY -- AND I WE LEFT. FEELING LIKE I HAD A GREATER -- POSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVING MY CFO ENVISION -- SO ACTUALLY WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF COMPLETELY PROGRAM I HAD TO SEE IF -- OFFICE -- SO IT WAS A SEISMIC SHIFT FOR ME AND I AND HE ENDED MASSIVE -- SO I AM NOW THE CFO OF SEMEN W. FAMILY WHICH INCLUDES A CHILD PROOF AND C. CAME ON W. -- THROUGH THAT I ALSO BECAME DIRECT -- TO ON THE BOARD OF APPELLATION SAINT HELENA SO I REALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO APPLY IN A VERY PRACTICAL WAY MY LEARNINGS -- THROUGH OUR STRATEGIC PROGRAM. TO BETTER THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR ONE TO ME ONE REMEMBERS AND CONSUMERS -- I I HAD AN IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT IN MY STOCK MANAGEMENT AS WE AS WE'VE HEARD FROM EVERYBODY LABOR IS SO CONSTRICTED THAT TO JUST. TURN THE DIAL IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY MAKES A MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT -- TO RETAINING STUFF. I'VE MADE LIFELONG FRIEND FRIENDSHIPS AND CONNECTIONS WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM I WOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD ABOUT MY OPPORTUNITY IT WAS -- ON THE QUIET -- I WAS PUT ON TO IT BY ONE OF MY COHORT MEMBERS SO HE REALLY HAD A DIRECT. IMPACT ON MY CAREER -- I'VE HAD UNPARALLELED EXPOSURE TO SENIOR LEADERS IN THE WINE INDUSTRY BOTH AT FACULTY LEVEL -- THROUGH LECTURES COMING -- FROM AT THAT BOTH PRESSES AND OTHER INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES -- AND IT REALLY HAS CEMENTED MY COMMITMENT TO MY INDUSTRY -- THERE THERE'S PEOPLE WHO COME AROUND FROM CANNABIS AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW YOU KNOW ABOUT ONE AND COME OVER TO OUR SIDE. NO THIS IS -- I I REALLY AT THAT THROUGH BEING ONE OF ONE AND A HALF PEOPLE WITH FINANCE ON MY COHORT. EVERYBODY ELSE IS FROM A DIFFERENT -- THAT SKILL SET TO MINE SO IT REALLY JUST MENTIONED MY WHY THE KNOWLEDGE OF OUR INDUSTRY -- SO AGAIN THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO RAY -- I I KNOW THAT WE WE MARCH ARM IN ARM ON OUR COMMITMENT TO THIS AND I WAS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M FEELING LIKE I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH. WHICH IS THE NEXT WE HAVE SHANNON WALKER HIGH THE STATE MANAGER HIDE THE STATE WINERY. HI THANK YOU. FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I APPRECIATE IT -- JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND ABOUT ME I GREW UP ON THE EAST COAST AT JUST RIGHT OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK CITY. I GREW UP IN A HOME THAT WAS WELL VERSED IN WINE MY GRANDFATHER AND MY FATHER BOTH SO I LEARNED ABOUT ONE OF THE YOUNG AGE I RECEIVED AN UNDERGRAD IN BROADCAST JOURNALISM AND SHORTLY AFTER LANDED A JOB AND TV NETWORKS AS THE ASSISTANT TO THE SP PF PRODUCTION. OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS I CLIMB MY WAY UP TO LINE PRODUCER OF ON AIR PROMOS FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT GROUP OF AND TV NETWORKS. AND WHAT I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MYSELF AND I HAD A LOT OF FUN DOING IT I WORK TWENTY TWO HOUR DAYS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK I TRAVEL CONSISTENTLY. I STARTED TO HATE MY LIFE PATH. EXCEPT FOR THE SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME THAT I BEGAN TAKING INTEREST IN MY LONG TIME FAMILY HOBBY OF WINE MAKING. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY TRANSITION INTO THE WINE INDUSTRY IN TWENTY ELEVEN I MADE MY FIRST VINTAGE OF MEL BACK WITH MY FATHER WITH GRACE FROM A COMPANY CALLED MUSTER ONE GREAT COMPANY. AND I ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE. NOW THAT'S GREAT COMPANY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEM THEY ARE A COMPANY THAT PURCHASED GRAPES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN SHIP THEM BACK ON A TRUCK TO THE EAST COAST EITHER IN JUICE OR GREAT FORM. FOR CUSTOMERS LIKE ME TO PURCHASE I MAKE HOMEMADE WINE IT'S A VERY INTERESTING BUSINESS MODEL AT THE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN -- MODEL AT THIS COMPANY PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN MY TRANSITION BECAUSE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS I BEGAN TO GET TO KNOW CHRISTINA MOSCOW. WHO IS NOW THE OWNER AND MANAGER OF MUSTER ONE GREAT COMPANY AND SHE HAPPENED TO BE IN THE FIRST COHORT OF THIS PROGRAM? SO SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS PROGRAM SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE LOVED IT AND SHE CONVINCED ME TO CHANGE MY CAREER. SO I DID. I APPLIED I GOT IN I WAS ACCEPTED I DROVE CROSS COUNTRY QUIT MY JOB AND LANDED HERE AND STARTED OVER. DURING THE PROGRAM A CLASSMATE'S WIFE HIRED ME OVER INGLENOOK WINERY AND I BEGAN TO LEARN ALL THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE SALES AND MARKETING FOR THIS INDUSTRY. BY THE END OF THE PROGRAM I WAS COMPLETELY INFATUATED AND I DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE NOW. THE BEING THE PERSON THAT I AM I KNEW I NEEDED A BIGGER CHALLENGE SO I ENDED UP LANDING A JOB FREE FLOW WINES AFTER MEETING THE OWNER JORDAN CABLE STAT DURING ONE OF OUR CLASSES WHEN HE WAS A GUEST SPEAKER. I SPENT THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF YEARS GROWING MY MARKETING AND SALES EXPERIENCE UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE HYDE FAMILY ASKED ME IF I WOULD COME WORK FOR THEM AND THAT'S WHEN I BEGAN MY NEXT CHAPTER. WHICH IS WORKING AT HYDE ESTATE WINERY IN CARNEROS. IT'S A NEW WINERY THAT OPENED UP IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND I'M CURRENTLY OVERSEEN THE STRATEGIC VISION OF THE TTC AND WHOLESALE CHANNELS. WE PRODUCE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CASES ITS SINGLE LOCKING ANWAR CHARDONNAY AMARILLO WE DO A FEW SMALLER VARIETALS LIKES TO ROTH AND FEELING AS WELL. IT'S UP ESTE GROWN PRODUCED AND BOTTLED FROM A SECTION OF HIDE VINEYARDS WHICH THE VINEYARD IN THE VALLEY THAT'S BEEN. SELLING GRAPES EXCLUSIVELY TO LEAK WINERY PRODUCERS FOR FORTY YEARS. SINCE I'VE COME ON BOARD I SUCCESSFULLY HELP THE FAMILY GROW THE TASTING ROOM TRAFFIC BY WHOLESALE BY 15%. WHICH WHAT I CONSIDER IS A REALLY GOOD TRAJECTORY FOR WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW IN JUST YEAR TWO OF THE TASTING ROOM. SO TO GET REALLY TO THE KNEE OF MY SPEECH HERE -- WHEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT THIS PROGRAM IS DONE FOR ME AT FIVE POINTS CAME TO MY MIND OBVIOUSLY THE CAREER CHANGE? FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME THIS PROGRAM REALLY HELP ME LAUNCH INTO THE WINE BUSINESS AND ENHANCE MY EDUCATION BY GIVING THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED IN THIS BUSINESS THEY PROVIDE A PRACTICAL APPLICATION. AND A SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDUSTRY. IT HAD FANTASTIC NETWORKING ASSETS YOU NOT ONLY PROVIDED ME WITH A GROUP OF WINE BUSINESS SAVVY PEOPLE TO UTILIZE BUT PROVIDED ME WITH A NETWORK OF PEOPLE TO GET TO KNOW SINCE I WAS NEW TO THE AREA. IT PROVIDED HIGHER EARNING POTENTIAL AND I KNOW THAT MOST I. MASTERS PROGRAM PROVIDE THIS ESPECIALLY WITH MY SPECIALTY WE SEE USUALLY AT 38% INCREASE IN PAY. BUT JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT I SPOKE TO THE COHORT LAST WEEK AND 95% OF THEM HAVE SAID BABY THERE SEEN A PAY INCREASE WERE THEY PLANTED THEIR DREAM JOB IN THE FOUR YEARS THAT WE'VE GRADUATED. AND FINALLY I CAN'T LEAVE IT OUT AS RAY POINTED TO THE TRAVEL YOU CAN DO AN INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL. SO YOU COULD TAKE EVERYTHING YOU'VE APPLIED AND GO SEE -- YOU KNOW SOMETHING FUN A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AT A VERY STRESSFUL TIME IN YOUR LIFE -- OVERALL THIS PROGRAM REALLY GAVE ME THE TOOLS TO SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCH MY NEW CAREER PATH. AND I COULD NOT BE DOING WHAT I'M CURRENTLY DOING AS CONFIDENTLY AS IN DOING IT IF I HADN'T GRADUATED FROM THEM SO THANK YOU -- THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIR AND WE ARE CURRY. SHARES MCGUIRE AND DODD. RATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I AM TONY STEVEN MY DAY JOB AND SHE SELLS OFFICER FOR SHIED FAMILY WINES IN MONTEREY CALIFORNIA -- MID SIZE WINERY INFORM CONCERN. I'M ALSO CHAIRPERSON OF THE AMERICAN WIENER FOUNDATION. AND THE NATIONAL GREAT RESEARCH ALLIANCE. TWO ORGANIZATIONS FOCUSED ON FUNDING RESEARCH IN THE WINE INDUSTRY -- IT'S BEEN DOING THAT FOR QUITE A WHILE I FEEL LIKE IT. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THE INDUSTRY. IT'S THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF IT -- AND I'M HERE TODAY TO GET TO REALLY ASK FOR A FOCUS ON RESEARCH FUNDING FOR INDUSTRY. I BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE DRESSED CAN BE SOLVED THROUGH THE RESEARCHER ADVANCE OF RESEARCH -- CALIFORNIA HAS A PLACE IN THE GLOBALLY. AS ONE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY PRODUCERS. IN THE WORLD WERE ALSO THE US IS ALSO THE PLACE TO MARKET WINE. AND OUR INDUSTRY GOES UP AGAINST SOVEREIGN FUNDS THAT FUND RESEARCH AND MARKETING EFFORTS -- BOTH IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND MARKET EFFORTS IN THE US SO THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION OUT THERE. AND WE SEE IT DIRECTLY. AND IF YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO AN EVENT LIKE PRO LINE YOU'LL SEE OUR PLACE. IN THE WINE INDUSTRY IS. IS NOT THIS IS NOT LARGE. IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA IS -- YOU KNOW WE'RE SITTING HERE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL FACILITY. GORGEOUS DAY I FEEL LIKE OUR INDUSTRY. HAS COME VERY FAR I'M A PRODUCT OF THE CLASS SIZE WITH A CULTURE PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS. I FARMED FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS GRAPES. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HERE. AND OF WE HAVE MOVED INTO -- THE TECHNICAL SIDE AND ALSO THE SALES SIDE OF THE WIND. SO I WANTED TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT -- TWO HIGHLIGHT TWO KEY INNOVATION TRANS THAT I FEEL LIKE OUR OPPORTUNITIES AND MAYBE EVEN. OUR OBLIGATION -- TO INCREASE RESEARCH FUNDING FOR I'M THE FIRST ONE IS THE ADVANCE. THE GREAT ADVANCEMENTS IN GENETIC RESEARCH -- TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED -- FOR THE HUMAN GENOME ARE BEING MOVED INTO -- UNLOCKING THE GENOME OF NOT ONLY GRAPEVINES AND CULTIVARS. BUT ALSO GREAT FUN PEST AND DISEASES AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES. AND CONTROL WHEN MAKING MORE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE OUR VINEYARDS BY WORKING ON THE HOUSE -- THERE THE WE'RE JUST BEGINNING TO APPLY THESE NEW TECHNIQUES. TO SOLVE MAJOR CHALLENGES -- AND THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY REDUCE OR EVEN ELIMINATE THE USE OF PESTICIDES BASED ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF GENETICS ABOUT THE THE THE VINES AND THE IN THE PAST. THE OTHER AREA IS IT IS ONE WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH. AND AND THAT IS -- THE USE OF DATA. AND USE IT EVERY DAY ON YOUR PHONE BUT BUT IN OUR UNIVERSE IT'S PRECISION FARMING. AND PRECISION FARMING -- IS A TERM THAT'S USED TO AND THAT'S IT'S BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND GRAIN CROPS. CROPS ARE PLANTED EVERY YEAR. IT'S A LOT HARDER AND PERENNIAL CROPS ONES WITH A PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT STAY UP YEAR AFTER YEAR. YOUR THREE YEAR -- SO WHAT IT REALLY MEANS IS RIGHT NOW WE MANAGE OUR VINEYARD BLOCKS AND IN. BASICALLY TWENTY ACRE BLOCKS WHATEVER SIZE THE BLOCK IS SOMETIMES MORE SOMETIMES LARGER. WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY NOW TO COLLECT DATA AT THE VINE LEVEL FIVE LINE SO FOR EXAMPLE AND AT SIDE WHEN YOU'RE. WE KNOW THE YIELD OFF OF EVERY VINE BY USING. RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD TECHNOLOGY THAT HUESO FRUIT COMING OFF. I CAN BEAR WHEN THE VINE IS HARVESTED. AND WE USE THAT IS OUR REPORT CARD FOR ALL THE INPUTS WE DID DURING THE YEAR. AND I I WANT TO JUST KIND OF GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT THIS PROMISES -- WE USE THAT AS ONE PIECE OF DATA AND THEN EVERYTHING WE PUT IN. WE USE IS -- OTHER LAYERS OF DATA FROM STUFF THAT DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SOIL. BUT THERE'S THE LABOR AND PARTS -- WE NOW HAVE MACHINES THAT WILL TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND WITHOUT. INDIVIDUAL MANAGEMENT BUT JUST WHAT THEY DO TO THE VINE. WHETHER THEY'RE SPRAYING OR OR LEAVE BURYING OUR SHOOT SENDING. THAT'S PRECISION FARMING AND AND IF WE CAN GET A 10% INCREASE. IN YIELD AND I AND OR JUST IN THE TYPE OF FRUIT WE WANT. IF WE CAN TAKE A LOW YIELDING VINES AND RAISE THEM UP THE HIGHLIGHT YIELDING VINES AND BRING THEM DOWN. THAT'S 10% ON IT ON IT CHRIS LIKE SHY THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED ADDITIONAL ACRES THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PLANT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO SPRAY. FERTILIZE WATER WHICH JUST DOING BETTER HONOR JUST INFORMING AND THAT'S NOT. THE FANTASY THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. JUST IN DIFFERENT STAGES. RIGHT NOW ONLY THE BIGGER COMPANIES -- GALLO'S STRIDE COMPANIES THAT ARE INNOVATIVE AND AND INVEST IN RESEARCH CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. BY FINDING THAT -- DIRECTLY BY FINDING DR BLOCKS PROGRAMS AND OTHER PROGRAMS AROUND -- THE STATE WE CAN BRING THAT TO EVERY FARMER THOSE CHALLENGES ARE REAL -- OUR LABOR COSTS. THE COST OF FARM INVENTOR FROM WHEN I STARTED INSIDE AND NOW IS UP 50%. BASICALLY FROM FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE. TO SIX THOUSAND THE THE LABOR COSTS JUST MANDATED LABOR RATES. ARE GOING TO CREATE A 40% INCREASE BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'M JUST A DIRECT COST OF LABOR -- THE OTHER PART IS OUR LABOR FORCES EIJI. AND AND THERE'S WE WOULD NEED TO BRING NEW PEOPLE AND THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE A LAPTOP. AND EVERY MACHINE WE HAVE NOW HAS A COMPUTER AND SO SO WITH THAT YOU CAN I GET THE PICTURE RIGHT THERE'S LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY OUT THERE -- IT'S NOT SCIENCE FICTION IT'S REAL THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING AND WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO TO YOU KNOW. BUILD A BETTER SYSTEM FAR MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY -- HAVE OUR PRODUCTS THAT ADAPT TO A CHANGING CLIMATE [INAUDIBLE] YEAH AND QUALITY RESEARCH CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED WITH CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE FUNDING. AND THE ATF HAS BEEN AROUND FOR FORTY YEARS SELF FUNDING. RESEARCH -- DRIVEN BY INDUSTRY VOLUNTEER. FALLING TEARS IT FROM THE RESEARCH WHY IT GOT LINES BECAUSE AFTER FEDERAL FUNDS -- AT THE END I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF CARPET THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF WINE GRAPE GROWERS. AND YOU HAVE A WHITE PAPER THAT DESCRIBES -- POTENTIAL FUNDING FOR AND TALENT AND PUBLIC PRIVATE FUNDED AND DOMINANT THE VALUE OF AN INDICTMENT IS THAT. THIS IS WHAT RESEARCHERS THE YOU CAN'T GET IT ALL DONE IN ONE FUNDING CYCLE IN ONE YEAR THIS YEAR AFTER YEAR AND AND THAT'S THE STABILITY THAT THE AMERICAN I'VE SEEN OF AMERICA VINEYARD FOUNDATION. WE RELIABLY FUN YOU'RE AFTER HERE WE CAN FIND MULTI YOUR PROJECTS AND A GENTLEMAN OF THE TYPE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- GENERATES THE SAME FINDS YOUR AFTER YEAR. AND WILL BE IT WILL ATTRACT RESEARCHERS WITH BIGGER PROJECTS AND MORE IMPORTANT PROJECTS SO. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THAT AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT. AND I THINK I WILL GO A LONG WAY TO IMPROVING OUR ABILITY OKAY CALIFORNIA'S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP. AND WIDEN VITICULTURE. SO THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING. WHAT THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS TODAY -- TRULY APPRECIATE IT I I DO WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ON YOUR LAST COMMENTS A MISTER STEVEN -- I LIVE AS WELL AS USE TODAY'S I LIVE RIGHT BY THE RESEARCH CENTER FOR THE GRAPES AND THEY HAVE THE LIBRARY THERE. AND I WAS JUST THERE FOR W. LOOK A DINNER THE OTHER DAY FOR THE WINNERS FARM TO SCHOOL PROGRAM AND THEN THE SPENT TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE ON A LONG TABLE. AND WE HAD A INCREDIBLE -- EDUCATION THAT DAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LIBRARY THEY HAVE THEIR AND THE YEAR BEFORE THEY SAID THEY WERE THE NUMBER ONE LIBRARY. THEY SAID THEY'VE NOW OR NUMBER TWO AND I WAS JUST CURIOUS HOW DO YOU GO TO NUMBER. TWO BUT I WAS YOU KNOW CURIOUS LIKE HOW DID THAT HAPPEN WAS IT. I'M JUST NEW BREEDS ARE -- TYPES OF ROOTS DOCTOR COMING OUT NOW OR AS A YOU KNOW. WHY WORRY ABOUT? ALL THE GREAT ALL THE GREAT BREW US DOCTORS OUT THERE I THINK EVERY SINGLE -- GRAPES IT'S EVER BEEN GROWN IS OUT AT THAT WE'LL SKILL RANCH [INAUDIBLE] YEAH. I'M NOT SURE HOW THOSE THINGS -- RANKED -- BUT CERTAINLY THAT KIND OF POSITIVE WORRY FOR PLANT MATERIALS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL SO YOU KNOW WITH WHICH HI FOUNDATION SERVICES OR ANDY WALKERS BREEDING PROGRAM IN OUR DEPARTMENT -- THOSE KIND OF RESOURCES -- REALLY EXPENSIVE BUT ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO COMING UP WITH. PLANT MATERIAL THAT'S THAT WILL LEAD TO DISEASE RESISTANCE OR DROUGHT TOLERANCE OR SMALL TOLERANCE OR ANY OTHER THINGS WE NEED. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT. SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT ON THAT NOTE TO UC DAVIS WHEN. I WAS ON MY PROGRAM WE WENT TO CROATIA AND WE VISITED THE UNIVERSITY OF RABIN. AND THEY HAD -- TO WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH UC DAVIS TO IDENTIFY THE GENEALOGY OF TRINIDAD. AND SO I I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY -- PROUD MOMENT FOR US TO BE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COUNTRY AND TO HAVE SUCH RECOGNITION SO IT REALLY IS GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED WHAT YOU'RE DOING. WELL DONE. AND THE GENETIC I THE GENETIC RESEARCH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE THAT WE SHOULD BE. FUNDING THAT KIND OF RESEARCH -- WE'VE DONE -- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PAST -- AND DISEASE. WE FOUND OUT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT -- CALIFORNIA PART OF PESTICIDE REGULATION THAT WE HAD REQUESTED THEM TO DO SOME NEW BIO DIVERSITY TYPE THINGS WITH -- PAST. AS I HELPED GET THE FUNDED. AND FOUND OUT. THEY HADN'T DONE ONE THING WITH IT. SO WE'VE BEEN SENSE AND HAD THEM IN OUR OFFICE TO SAY WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE PEOPLE WERE WORKING ON SPECIFICALLY ON TRYING TO REDUCE THE USE OF PESTICIDES. HERBICIDES ETCETERA AND SO I WHAT YOU CAN BE ASSURED THAT WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON IT BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO REDUCE. OF THOSE TYPES OF A OF CHEMICALS OF FOUR CROPS. AND LASTLY IT'S BEEN AMAZING IN THE SHORT TIME THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURES OF THE TRAINING MY OTHER COLLEAGUES FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT. IT TAKES TO BE A FARMER. AND SO ARE YOU YOU -- HIT A NERVE WITH ME WHICH IS A GOOD NERVOUS JUST SAYING PRECISION FARMING -- ROOTS WHAT I TELL PEOPLE BATES TO STILL SHOW UP IN THE BOTTLES THEY DON'T JUST SHOW UP IN THE GROCERY STORE -- BUT IT STARTS FROM THE HEALTHY SOIL TO THE ROOT STOCK TO MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE NURTURING THAT PLANT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. ITS LIFE SO -- THEY'RE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND IT WE'RE TAKING THEM ON TOURS AND HOPEFULLY THE SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WE REQUEST -- GOING FOR A FORWARD WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET SOME FUNDING FOR SOME OF THOSE AS LONG AS WE EDUCATE SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES THAT ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING OF AGRICULTURE IT'S REALLY. IMPORTANT WE DO SO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IN COMMON. THANK YOU SO MUCH BEN CHAIR WONDERFUL JOB EACH VIEW THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. I MISS JOHNSON TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ON THE ISSUE OF RESEARCH IN WHERE YOU'D LIKE TO GO OBVIOUSLY. THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A FINE CAN JUST GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A DEEPER DIVE. INTO SOME OF THE WEAKNESSES THAT WE NEED WIENER SHORE UP WITH ADDITIONAL RESEARCH WHICH WOULD IMPROVISE WITH DATA. YES. SO FIRST OFF THE DISASTER PREPAREDNESS IS A PROJECT -- THAT THE FACULTY WILL PRESENT THE FIRST SLICE OF ON JULY TENTH. SO -- IF ONE OF YOUR STAFF -- WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO COME BACK TO CAMPUS -- WE WELCOME THAT YOU GET A LOOK AT THAT FIRST HAND -- ALSO THAT THEY WILL BE PRESENTING SOME PREVIEWS OF SOME LONGER RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT PEOPLE ARE DEVELOPING. IN PARTICULAR ON THE Z. GENERATION AND THEIR INTEREST -- OR LESS INTEREST IN WINE AND WHERE THAT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT DEVELOP -- RIGHT NOW IS IT'S A IT'S A I CHALLENGE THE INDUSTRY WANTS TO GET AHEAD RIGHT. SO IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET -- TONY HAD TALKED ABOUT -- THE FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE TO IN OTHER COUNTRIES FOR THEIR WORK SO THEN NOT ONLY FOR RESEARCH IN -- PLANT PRODUCTION AND WINEMAKING BUT ALSO IN THE MARKETING AND IT REALLY IS ASTOUNDING THE MARKETING DOLLARS THAT ARE PUT FORWARD BY OTHER COUNTRIES. SO WE'RE WORKING ON PROJECTS TO HELP BETTER IDENTIFY HOW TO REACH OUR TARGET CONSUMERS. AND THEN THE THIRD ONE IN THAT REALM IS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH CONSUMERS -- THE LIFEBLOOD FOR MANY WINERIES WHEN YOU -- JANET GAVE YOU SOME -- SOME STATISTICS ON HOW THEIR SALES BREAK DOWN BY CHANNEL IN THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER CHANNEL HAS BECOME A VERY IMPORTANT ONE AND GETTING THAT RIGHT WHAT WE FIND IS CONSUMERS NOT ONLY OF OLDER SEGMENTS BUT IN PARTICULAR OF YOUNGER SEGMENTS. ARE LOOKING FOR AN EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY COME TO A WINERY AND SO HELPING OUR WINERIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE AND ATTRACT MORE CONSUMERS TO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE IS IS REALLY VITAL. YEAH YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT INTO IF YOU ALL DON'T MIND AND THEN AT THE TOP OF SMOKE TEEN ISSUES WELL. WHAT IS IN REGARDS TO THE TO THE EXPERIENCE SERVICES THEY'RE GONNA? ENHANCE -- DESIRE FOR FOOD PAIRINGS RIGHT SIR COMING TO THE TASTING ROOM -- HAVING TO BE ABLE TO PACKAGE THIS WITH OVERSEAS TO WALK US THROUGH IF YOU LOOK OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. BIGGEST CHANGE WE THINK WE'RE GOING IN REGARD TO THAT EXPERIENCE. AND IT ALSO TALK WITH ABOUT LOYALTY. ARE YOU SEEING FOLKS STUCK WITH ONE BRAND. ARE YOU SEEING FOLKS DOING -- PRICE TAG SHOP IN WHAT IS THAT. I THAT YOU SEEN ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT'S A PRETTY LOADED QUESTION. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT MARKET YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR SPECIFICALLY AT HIGH TO STAY WHERE A SMALL BOUTIQUE FAMILY OWNED FAMILY RUN WINERY. SO THAT'S TYPE OF THAT CUSTOMERS THAT WE'RE GETTING WE'RE NOT DOING FOOD PAIRINGS WORD NOT HAVING LARGE TOWARDS OR NOT JEAN BACHELORETTES WE'RE TRYING TO GET ONE I. ONE VERY FOCUSED EDUCATIONAL WITH. WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE VINEYARD AND HOW THAT'S SHOWCASING IN THE CLASS OF ONE THIRTY STEVEN? SO THAT'S OUR EXPERIENCE NOT THE CLIENTELE WERE GETTING WHEN IT COMES TO LOYALTY ONCE THEY BECOME A MEMBER OF OURS AND THEY'RE USUALLY. I WOULD HOPE FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE BEEN OPEN FOR TWO YEARS BUT WE GET PEOPLE WHO KNOW US THEY KNOW US BY NAME THEY KNOW MY FATHER IN LAW MY MOTHER IN LAW THEY THEY HAVE AN EXPERIENCE WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THEIR FAMILY WITHOUT HER INVESTED. THEIR INVESTED WITH US AND WHAT I'M SHOWCASING AND I'VE SEEN IS THAT I'M GETTING A LOT PEOPLE MY AGE OR YOUNGER WHO ARE. COMING UP FROM SAN FRANCISCO DON'T WANT TO GO ALL THE WAY AT VALLEY THEY THEY WANT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR BOTTLE CAPS THEY'RE ENJOYING A PIANO AND CHARDONNAY BUT IT A DECENT PRICE. SO I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON EACH WINERY IN EAT WHAT EACH PERSON LOOKING TO GIVE. AND WHEN I GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THE PEOPLE I ALWAYS SAY WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE WOULD YOU LIKE IN THE VALLEY BECAUSE WE CAN OFFER ANYTHING FOR YOU HOW MUCH SUSTAINABILITY PLAY INTO THAT LOYALTY YOU. THEY HOW YOU FARM -- IN WORKING ON THAT STORY TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT GREAT INTO THE BOTTLE. IT'S A MAKE MAJOR DIFFERENCE AND I DO AT A CUSTOM FREE FLOW WINDS FOR TEACHING ME SO MUCH ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY BECAUSE AS AN EAST COASTER. LET'S FACE IT WE'RE NOT VERY SUSTAINABLE PEOPLE. IT IS NOT FOR ME WHEN I AGRICULTURE WHAT'S DIFFERENT -- SO FOR US IT'S IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE ARE ORGANIC THAT WE DON'T DO A LOT TO THE GRAVE ONCE IT HITS WE LET SHOWCASE WHAT IT'S DOING. AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GETTING SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE SUSTAINABILITY WE ARE NOT A CERTIFIED GREEN WE HAVE ALL OF OUR SIGNS UP WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF IT -- AND WE HAVE A SUSTAINABILITY PLANNED SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT SENSE THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR SO WE ARE A BELLY. AND WE DO HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES SO WE WE WORK ON SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MODELS SHANNON -- WHICH IS GOOD -- VERY COMPLIMENTARY -- WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IN THE PASSING YEARS IS THAT PEOPLE REALLY ARE INTERESTED IN TRYING TO HIT? FIVE OR SIX WINERIES IN ONE DAY THEY ARE INVESTING MORE OF THEIR TIME AND THEY DO YOU WANT A MORE ROUNDED EXPERIENCE -- WHETHER THAT BE -- MOMENT WITH THE WIND MAKE -- WHETHER THAT BE AN ACTIVITY AROUND WINE -- WE ARE FINDING THAT WE HAVE QUITE A BLEND OF VERY LOYAL OLDER CUSTOMERS BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF MILLENNIALS ARE COMING THROUGH AND THEY ARE. MORE TRICKY TO CAPTURE AND AND KEEP THE OIL I THINK THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF A THRIVING FOR EXPERIMENTATION WITH THAT THAT SET -- SO WE DO INVEST A LOT OF TIME IN OUR OWN INTERNAL RESEARCH ON WHAT RESONATES WITH THOSE ON THE SETS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THEY WILL BECOME OUR LOYAL ONE CONSUME AS A FUTURE SO -- WE ARE SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD NOW WE'VE WE TAKE PRIDE IN BEING THE FIRST WINERY BUT WE HAVE TO STAY NIMBLE AND HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE. AND JUST BE AHEAD OF THE GAME -- GIVEN THE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF COMPETITION. IN THE QUESTION DESIGNED FOR SUSTAINABILITY HOW MUCH DOES THAT PLAY INTO THE MESSAGES WELL RIGHT AS FAR AS YOUR MISSION. AND THE OTHER PIECES SO -- ARE YOU FINDING YOUNGER CONSUMERS ARE MORE FOCUSED ON WHAT IF IT'S NOT GONNA BE I'M MAKING THIS UP ONE OR TWO BRANDS THAT THEY LIKE. WHAT DO THEY WANT? I THINK THEY WANT A SENSE OF ADVENTURE -- AND I THINK THEY THEY GET THAT FROM HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE AROUND ONE AND HAVING THAT MOMENT THAT THEY CAN TAKE BACK HOME TO SAIL WHEN I WAS A CHILD COULD I GET THIS -- SO I THINK IT IS -- IT'S COMBINING THAT THAT ONE MOMENT AND TAKEN AT HOME -- SUSTAINABILITY FOR US WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL STATE AND SO WE AUTOMATICALLY BENEFIT FROM THE FEELING OF SUSTAINABILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO VISIT THE STATE -- SO IT IT DOES RESONATE -- AS WELL AS THE TALE OF OF HAVING A WINERY THAT'S WITHSTOOD THE TEST OF TIME AND THE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE SO -- WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF BEING ABLE. TO MAKE MORE OF OUR I STAYED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. MIKE IF I COULD IS SENATE REQUIRE IF I COULD ADD -- IN ADDITION -- TO WHAT CLAIRE. AND SHANNON SHARED THE THE THIS ISSUE THAT YOU BRING UP ABOUT LOYALTY IS IS A CHALLENGING ONE TO OVERCOME RIGHT. AND AND HOW DO YOU SOLVE FOR THAT SO ONE OF THE RESEARCH PROJECTS WE'VE HAD HAS LOOKED AT THE DATA THAT JUST EXIST AT THE WINERY DURING THE WINERY EXPERIENCE WHAT DO WE LEARN ABOUT THAT CUSTOMER SO THAT WE CAN BETTER BE ABLE TO GIVE THAT BACK WHAT IT. IS THEY LIVE. SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S ONE TRANCHE AND THEN THE SECOND IS -- SUSTAINABILITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE END WE SEE PEOPLE STARTING TO FOCUS THEIR BUYING -- THE SIM CONNIE WINE GROWERS HAVE DONE SOME REALLY GOOD STUDIES ON THIS AND OUR BOARD HAS ASKED US TO HELP. DEFINE WHAT SUSTAINABILITY MEANS TO PEOPLE IN THEIR MINDS SO THAT'S A FUTURE PROJECT THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON BECAUSE IT'S THE DEFINITION IS IS TOUGH IF YOU ASK TEN PEOPLE YOU MAY NOT GET YOU WON'T GET THE SAME ANSWER. SO WE'D LIKE TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THAT THAT WOULD FACILITATE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE ALREADY DOING IN THEIR VINEYARDS AND WINERIES. SO IT TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY PIECE. IT COULD TAKE A COUPLE HOURS IF WE HAD A CONFERENCE LIKE THIS YEAH SO SO -- SIDE FAMILY WINES. WE MARKET AROUND THE WORLD THERE'S SIXTY BRANDS AND WE SELL OVERSEAS AND AND IF IT IS THE FIRST QUESTION. OVER THERE -- SO WE WE HAVE A TWO MEGAWATT WIND TURBINE 1100% POWER BY WHEN WE RECYCLE EVERYTHING -- WATER COMPOST OUR VINEYARDS ARE ALSO STATED WE CERTIFIED SO. I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH A A SWEDISH BUYER YESTERDAY THERE'S A NEW TENDER. FROM SWEDEN WHICH MEANS THAT'S HOW THEY PURCHASE THERE ONE THREE TENDERS. AND THE WINERY NOT ONLY THE GRAPES AND TO BE ASSISTING WITH CERTIFIED THE WINERIES TO BE SUSTAINABLE CERTIFIED SO THE WINE INSTITUTE NOW HAS THE CERTIFICATION. ALMOST NO WINERIES HAVE IT YET SO OURS HAS IT STARTING WITH THE EIGHTEEN VANTAGE SO IT'S NOT JUST THE CONSUMER I MEAN IT IS ULTIMATELY BUT IF THE BUYER. THE GATE KEEPER THAT'S LOOKING FOR SUSTAINABILITY SO YOU ASKED ABOUT STICKINESS OF OF CUSTOMERS AND AUTHENTICITY. A ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AS DIGITAL MARKETING. THAT HELPS THE SUSTAINABILITY I'M THE THE STICKINESS OF OF YOUR CUSTOMERS -- I MEAN YOU HAVE TO DO THAT NOW -- OR YOU WANT ATTRACT CUSTOMERS YOU WON'T YOU WON'T KEEP THEM IN A CUP AND A QUANTITY IN THE I ALSO THINK THE QUALITY OF YOUR PRODUCT. ADS -- TO HOW LONG THEY STAY WITH YOU YOU MIGHT GET A MENU MUCH ALMOST YOUR CHOICE BUT IF YOU MAKE A REAL HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT AND YOU KEEP THAT UP. AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR YOUR CUSTOMERS. IF I COULD JUST ORDER SOMETHING. I THINK -- WHAT WHAT I'VE NOTICED IN THE INDUSTRY IS THE THERE'S A HUGE INTEREST IN SUSTAINABILITY? WHETHER TOM THE WINERY SIDE PEOPLE COMING TO OUR WATER TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO A THOROUGH WATER YOU'RE THE VINEYARD -- I PROBABLY SHOULD SEE THAT INTEREST MORE OFTEN THAN I SEE IT IN THE MARKETING. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE REMEMBER THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A FARMING IT'S NEVER CULTURAL. IN THOSE WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE THAT I TALK TO ARE SO INTERESTING SUSTAINABILITY -- THEY'RE INTERESTED BECAUSE THEY WANT THE FORM TO BE THERE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. AND THAT'S REALLY THE KEY ISSUE EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT USING IT FOR MARKETING. THANK YOU SENATOR IMMIGRATION. YOU KNOW TOM YOU'VE GOT A GROUP AUTOMATIC SO I JUST HAD A COMMENT WILL BE OVER WORK ON THE FUNNY BIT. IT'S HARD FOR ME JUST TO BE REALISTIC. SEE THE THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO GIVE ANY TYPE OF RESEARCH FOR MARKETING OR THINGS THAT. I MEAN. MOVE YOUR MOVE IN THAT WAY BUT I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST THAT. ON ALL THINGS CLIMATE. AIR QUALITY WATER QUALITY LABOR EAMER GYPSY PREPARED THIS. THESE ARE THE AREAS THAT WE DO HAVE POT SOMEBODY. THAT PERHAPS GRANTS COULD BE ISSUE WITH SUPPORT FROM MEMBERS. SO WE LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU. ALL THE ONE THAT. IF YOU SAY THERE SEVEN HUNDRED FOUR BILLION DOLLARS RESEARCH UC DAVIS THERE'S A POT OF MONEY AND HANNAH AREA NOT GONNA HAPPEN PERFECT. WE WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO OUR FIRST PANELIST GIVE THE ROUND OF APPLIES AND WONDERFUL WORK THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR SHARING THE PERSONAL STORIES AS WELL WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL. THE GERMAN ON BEHALF OF CHAIR DODD AND CHEER I WE ARE CURRY WE'D LIKE TO BE A TRANSITION TO OUR SECOND PANEL OUR SECOND PANEL IS GONNA BE FOCUSING ON EMERGING MARKETS IN APPELLATIONS WE'RE GOING. TO HAVE THEM BE ABLE TO ADVANCE AT THIS TIME WE'RE THRILLED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EXPERTS FROM RIGHT HERE AT HOME REPRESENTING. LAKE IN MANY IN CINEMA COUNTY SOME EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE FROM THE WINE INSTITUTE. THEY'RE GOING TO HELP US UNDERSTAND THE OPPORTUNITIES IN ISSUES THE WINE INDUSTRY FACES IN EMERGING MARKETS. AND MARKETING YOU APPELLATION. ANDY TALK ABOUT TRADE IN TERRACE WE WANT TO APOLOGIZE AHEAD OF TIME FOR ANY CUSSING DURING THE TRADE IN TERROR OF CONVERSATION -- EACH PANELIST I. WILL HAVE FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES -- SO WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME FOR QUESTIONS IN CONVERSATION. AND WE ARE THRILLED TO KICK OFF OUR PANEL WITH THE DEVER SUMMERFIELD SHE IS THE HARD WORKING PRESIDENT OF THE LAKE COUNTY WINE GRAPE COMMISSION WE WELCOME HER IN OUR PANEL. TO THE HEARING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THIS SUMMER FIELD YOU HAVE FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES IN THE FLOOR IS YOURS IN GOOD AFTERNOON WE'RE GONNA GET THAT CLICKER READY TO GO. YEAH I WANNA MAKE SURE THE OUR POWER POINT IS ON I BELIEVE AND DOUBLE CHECK AT THE POWER POINT -- GIVE THIS ONE MOMENT. WHICH I HIT THE BUTTON THERE DIFFERENT. AND WHERE WE GO [INAUDIBLE] BILL [INAUDIBLE] YEAH. ALL RIGHT WE'RE FIRED UP READY TO GO SO. FIVE TO SEVEN BUSINESS OUR FIELD THANK YOU AGAIN IN THE FUTURE PAN OVER BEING. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD SENATOR MCGUIRE AND SOME REMEMBER WE ARE CURRY -- TRIPLE THAT MIKE FOR LOCAL CERTAINLY HIT THE BUTTON RIGHT THERE RICHARD GREEN LIGHT IS ON OKAY. THANKS -- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND SPEAK ABOUT -- BILLY COUNTY ONE REGION. WHAT MAKES A DISTINCT WHY GREAT BUYERS AND ONE CONSUMERS ALIKE ARE TAKING NOTICE? PART OF THE NORTH COAST APPELLATION ADJACENT TO CINEMA MENDIS YOU KNOW AND NAPA. COUNTIES KNOWN AS THE MOUNTAINS OF THE NORTH COAST AS YOU CAN SEE. IT IS SITUATED ACROSS THE NEAR TRIANGLE OF NORTH COAST MOUNTAIN RANGES THE MAYACAMAS THE VIDAK AS AND THE MENACING AMOUNT RANGE. HERE SOME OF THE STATS ON OUR REGION -- LEE COUNTY HAS NEARLY TEN THOUSAND OF EIGHT ACRES OF WINE GRAPES PLANTED GROUND BY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY GROWERS. APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE CROP IS PURCHASED BY WINERY BUYERS IN NAPA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE NORTH COAST. SORRY YOUR BLOG AND CABERNET SAUVIGNON TOGETHER MAKE UP ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE CROP AND ANOTHER THIRD IS MADE UP BY DOZENS OF OTHER RIVALS. WAKE COUNTY IS PART OF THE NORTH COAST AVA AND WITHIN LIKE COUNTY THERE ARE SEVEN DESIGNATED ABA'S INTO MORE CURRENTLY IN THE PIPELINE WITH TTB. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR REGION WE TALK ABOUT THE DISTINCT COMBINATION OF CLIMATE GEOLOGY AND SOILS AND THE IMPACT ON THE CHARACTER OF THE GRAPES AND ONCE? THE MOST DISTINGUISHING FEATURE IS THE ELEVATION THE MAJORITY OF VINEYARDS ARE PLANTED ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET. HIGHER PUTS THREE DYNAMICS INTO PLAY DRYER SHORTER AND COLDER. LAKE COUNTY FRUIT RECEIVES EXCELLENT UV EXPOSURE UP 210% MORE UV THAN NEIGHBORING C. LEVEL VALLEYS. THAT INCREASED UV TRIGGERS THICKER SKINS AND INTENSE WINDS WITHIN ALL KLAY RIPE TANNINS. WAKE COUNTY HAS POSITIONED ITSELF AS A LEADER IN HIGH ALTITUDE ONE GREAT PRODUCTION THE REGION HAS HOSTED. INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIA THE ELEVATION OF ONE PROGRAM. AS A HIGH ELEVATION REGIONALLY COUNTY HAS A DRIER CLIMATE AND CONSISTENTLY MUCH LESS HUMIDITY LITTLE TO NO FOG COMPARED TO ITS NEIGHBORS IN FACT IT TYPICALLY HAS ABOUT 50% LESS HUMID. HUMIDITY THE NAPA DURING THE GROWING SEASON. DRY CONDITIONS HELP PREVENT ROT AND THAT ALLOWS GROWERS TO USE LESS SULFUR IN THE VINEYARD WHICH FACILITATES FOR QUALITY AND REDUCES OPERATIONAL COSTS. LAKE COUNTY HAS A SHORTER GROWING SEASON IN THIS LIMITS VEGETATIVE GROWTH THAT CAN INCREASE PEST PRESSURE. COLDER WINTERS KILL OFF MANY OVER WINTERING PASS AND BOTH OF THESE FACTORS LEAD TO REDUCED USE OF PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES IN THE VINEYARD. THE REGION EXPERIENCES SIGNIFICANT DIE ARE DIURNAL SHIFT WITH WARM DAYS AND COOL NIGHTS AND OFTEN A SWING OF MORE THAN FIFTY DEGREES IN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD. THIS FIXES DEEP COLOR WHILE RETAINING NATURAL ACIDITY CREATING COMPLEX WINES. THE WIND FACTOR FROM THE LAKE LENDS A MODERATING INFLUENCE AND ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE CLEAR SKIES ALL THESE FACTORS TOGETHER CONTRIBUTE TO WINDS WITH PURITY OF FRUIT. HI NATURAL ACIDITY AND RESTRAINED ALCOHOL WITH AND ALL RIGHT MISS. GEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING THIS GRAPHIC SHOWS MANY OF THE TECTONIC FORCES AT PLAY INCLUDING THE NORTH COAST MAGMA POCKET BENEATH NOT CANNOT DIE THE PINK AREA THERE ON THE MAP. WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY UNDER HOWELL MOUNTAIN AND OTHER PEAKS MILLENNIA PRIOR. AT THE CENTER OF THE COUNTY IS MOUNT CANNOT DIE A DORMANT VOLCANO NOT EXTINCT DORMANT -- THAT LAST REP AT APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO. NO NO I KNOW RIGHT [INAUDIBLE] YEAH. THAT'S ALRIGHT IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTY IS ROUND MOUNTAIN A YOUNG CYNDER CONE AND IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTY AS YOU ALL KNOW IS THE GEYSERS THE WORLD'S LARGEST COMPLEX OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY -- AND BECAUSE OF THE REGION'S ERUPTIVE PAST -- YOU FIND A DIVERSITY OF SOIL TYPES ACROSS THE REGION DOMINATED BY ABOUT YOUNG VOLCANIC SOILS THAT ARE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND YEARS OLD. NOW AS AN ORGANIZATION MUCH OF WHAT WE DO IS TO HELP EDUCATE OUR GROWERS -- THROUGH DEMONSTRATIONS SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS ALL FOCUSED ON LEARNING MORE ABOUT HIGH ELEVATION FARMING SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES AND MARKET DEMANDS TRENDS AND FORECASTS. THE GEM OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM IS THE MASTER IN YOUR OWN ACADEMY. THIS IS ONE ORDERS ARE VERY PROUD OF IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY TWELVE AS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR SPANISH SPEAKING VINEYARD SUPERVISORS -- TO DATE SEVENTY THREE GRADUATES HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROGRAM -- OR TWENTY NINETEEN CLASS THERE'S NINE RIGHT NOW WHO ARE WRAPPING UP IN AUGUST -- WE DO GRADUATION NOVEMBER. OVER THE COURSE OF EIGHT MONTHLY SESSIONS THE CLASS VISITS VINEYARDS AND WINERIES ACROSS THE NORTH COAST AS WELL AS YOU C. DAVIS. FOUNDATION PLANT SERVICES AND GREAT BY NURSERIES AND THE GROUP TOWARDS THE TRADE SHOW FLOOR AT THE UNIFIED ONE GREAT SYMPOSIUM IN SACRAMENTO. IN. I JUST WANT TO SAY IN OUR FIRST CLASS BACK IN. TWENTY TWELVE THE CLASSES TORN A LARGE WINERY IN SONOMA COUNTY. AND ONE OF THE STUDENTS WAS A VINEYARD SUPERVISOR WHO'D WORKED IN VINEYARDS WERE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND HE LEANED OVER TO OUR EDUCATION DIRECTOR. AND HE SAID THAT IN IN ALL OF HIS TIME HE HAD NEVER ACTUALLY STEPPED FOOT INSIDE OF A WINERY. SO THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE NEED OF THIS PROGRAM. AS PART OF OUR MARKETING EFFORTS WE PRESENT IN DEPTH TECHNICAL SEMINARS FOR GREAT BUYERS TO UNDERSTAND THE NUANCES OF WINE GROWING IN OUR HIGH ELEVATION REGION AS A WAY TO HELP INFORM THEIR WINE MAKING. WE INVITE SOMMELIERS IN WINDER ACTORS TO COME TO OUR REGION FOR A DEEP DIVE WITH TOURS ACROSS THE ABA'S WITH OUR MOST EXPERIENCED GROWERS. AND TECHNICAL TASTINGS WITH OUR MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE WINEMAKERS. WE ALSO SIMILAR TRIPS TO WALKING KEY MEMBERS OF THE WINE PRESS AS WELL AS DISTRIBUTORS RETAILERS AND OTHERS IN THE TRADE. AND AS A SMALL ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING A SMALL REGION WE TREASURE OUR PARTNERS WHO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO DELIVER TRULY HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMMING. SEE A FEW OF THE LOVE IS THERE THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT. WOULDN'T FIT ON SLIDE. AND WITH ALL THAT SAID WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER TIME IS THAT THE DISTINCT CHARACTER OF OUR GROWING REGION COMBINED WITH A GROWER COMMITMENT TO DELIVER ONLY HIGH QUALITY GRAPES. PRODUCED BY KNOWLEDGEABLE BEN YOUR TEAMS HAS TRANSLATED INTO BUYER DEMAND AND HIGHER GREAT PRICES YEAR OVER YEAR. OUR GROWERS ARE PROUD OF OUR REGION AND WE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO SHARE IT WITH YOU. NICE JOB THANK YOU SO MUCH OF A GREAT FOR THE HERE TODAY WE'RE GONNA HOLD QUESTIONS IF THAT'S OKAY WITH THE PANEL. RIGHT TO THE END WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE OUR INTERVIEWS BURNED IT. SHE'S EXACTLY DRACULA MISSING A WINE GROWERS INCORPORATED. THAT WE SO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE KNOW THAT YOU ARE WORKING HARD EVERY DAY ON BEHALF OF THESE YOU KNOW COUNTY WINE. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE AT FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE HAPPY TO REPRESENT NANCY NO COUNTY -- I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MENDOCINO WINEGROWERS INK WE ARE A MARKETING ORGANIZATION OUR JOB IS TO MARKET AND PROMOTE MEDICINE A WINE AND GRAPE SO I'M GONNA SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. IN OUR WORK -- HERE WITH YOU TODAY. SO FOR SOMEONE TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE UPDATE ABOUT THE MEDICINE -- COUNTY APPELLATION OUR CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. MADISON COUNTY IS A LARGE REGION TWO POINT FOUR MILLION ACRES WITH LESS THAN 1% OF THE TOTAL ACREAGE PLANTED THE GRAPES. THE AVERAGE SIZE OF OUR INDIVIDUAL VINEYARDS ARE SMALL FIFTEEN ACRES AND MOSTLY STILL FAMILY OWNED. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FIFTEEN WINERIES IN MEDICINE ACCOUNTING ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THESE ARE BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES. THESE WINERIES ARE MOSTLY IN SMALL TO MID SIZE WINERIES WITH JUST A FEW LARGE WINERY SUCH AS FETZER PARDUCCI ROEDERER AND SHARP FROM BURGER. HAVING ONLY SMALL TO MID SIZE WINERIES LIMITS THE MARKETING CLOUT THAT THESE WINERIES HAVE IN THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETER MARKING PLACE. THERE ARE NOT THE HUGE MARKETING BUDGETS THAT LARGE WINERIES WOULD HAVE TO MARKET THEIR REGION -- AND THAT IS A CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IN MENDOCINO COUNTY. SO THE MENDOCINO GREAT MARKET HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A COMMODITY MARKET. MEDICINE A SELLS ABOUT 50% OF OUR GRAPES OUTSIDE OF MENDOCINO COUNTY MAINLY TO NAPA AND HERE IN CINEMA COUNTY. CHARDONNAY AND CABERNET ARE DOMINANT VARIETALS REPRESENTING CLOSE 250% OF THE TOTAL GREAT PRODUCTION IN MENDOCINO COUNTY. THESE POPULAR VARIETALS ARE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER AS ECONOMICAL BLENDERS -- IN CINEMA AND NAPA WINES. SO THE MENDOCINO GRAPE MARKET IS CAUGHT IN A VICIOUS VOLATILITY CYCLE. PRICES SPIKED WITH DEMAND. AND PRICES PLUNGE WHEN THE MARKET IS SOFT. LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN VINTAGE. IT WAS A HUGE ADVANTAGE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE TONNAGE IN MENDOCINO COUNTY WAS UP 16%. AND IN THE NORTH COAST THE TONNAGE WAS UP 26%. THIS HUGE CROP IN THE NORTH COAST WILL DEFINITELY IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR MENDOCINO COUNTY FRUIT. THE TOTAL VALUE OF THAT TWENTY EIGHTEEN GRAPE CROP IN MENDOCINO WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION THAT'S THE BIGGEST CROP EVER FOR MENDOCINO COUNTY. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE MARKET IS. RELATIVELY SOFT NOW DUE TO THE HUGE CROP IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE THE WINE MARKET IS RIYADH THEIR SLUGGISH. BOOK MARKET ACTIVITY IS SLOW AND BOLD INVENTORIES ARE INCREASING. WINERIES ARE GRAPPLING WITH INVENTORY FROM THE LARGE TWENTY EIGHTEEN HARVEST AND IN MANY CASES. CASES THE WINERIES ARE ALSO SELLERS THEMSELVES OF GRAPES AND WILK WINE. HENCE THERE'S MORE GRAPES ON THE SPARK SPOT MARKET IS WINERIES HAVE GIVEN CONTRACT NOTICES TO GROWERS. AND ONE OF THE LARGE INDUSTRY TRANSACTIONS THE CONSTELLATION SALE TO GALLO. ADDS TO OUR MARKET INSTABILITY AND INSECURITY OF THOSE GREAT CONTRACTS THAT WERE GOING TO CONSTELLATION. SO HOW DO WE CHANGE MEANT THE SCENE -- AS A COMMODITY DRIVEN MARKET. MARKETING AND TOURISM. WINE TOURISM SO IMPORTANT FOR BRAND AWARENESS. THE MENDOCINO ONE GROWERS HAS PARTNERED WITH OUR COUNTIES DMO OUR DESTINATION MARKETING ORGANIZATION VISIT MENDOCINO COUNTY. WE'RE FOCUSING OUR MARKETING EFFORTS ON OUR KEY MARKETS THAT WOULD BE THE SAME SISCO BAY AREA MARKET AND SACRAMENTO. WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO HOST AND PROMOTE EVENTS THAT DROP IS RESTORE REGION AND OUR TASTING ROOMS. BUT HOW CAN WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LONG TERM SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY OF MENDOCINO COUNTY WINE GRAPES. WE BELIEVE IT IS CONJUNCTIVE LABELING. MEDICINE A ONE VERSUS BEEN WORKING WITH CENTER MIKE MCGUIRE FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. TO DEVELOP AN ULTIMATELY PASS CONJUNCTIVE LABELING FOR MENDOCINO COUNTY. CONJUNCTIVE LABELING. LABELING OF A OF THE WIND TO SHOW BOTH REGION AND THE SUB REGIONS OF ORIGIN. CONDUCTED LABELING IMPROVES OVERALL COUNTY IN EVEN GREATER SUB AVA RECOGNITION AND AWARENESS. THIS IS BEEN DONE SUCCESSFULLY IN NAPA. AND SONOMA COUNTY MODERATE PASO ROBLES. WHY CONJUNCTIVE LABELING? THERE TO OVERREACHING REASONS FOR PURSUING CONJUNCTIVE LABELING. FIRST TO CAPITALIZE ON THE RICH HISTORY AND BRAND IDENTITY THAT MENDOCINO COUNTY HAS WITH CONSUMERS WORLDWIDE. AND SECOND TO RAISE THE AWARENESS OF THE ENTIRE WINE GROWING REGION AS A COLLECTIVE WHOLE. CINEMA STATE UNIVERSITY'S WINE BUSINESS INSTITUTE CONDUCTED A STUDY TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT THE CONJUNCTIVE LABELING HAD ON THE CINEMA WINE REGION. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE WAS A GREATER LEVEL OF AWARENESS AT A REGIONAL LEVEL AND EVEN SO EVEN MORE SO FOR THE SMALLER APPELLATIONS OF THE COUNTY. THIS FINDING INDICATES THAT CONJUNCTIVE LABELING HAS HAD A PAPPAS POSITIVE IMPACT ON CONSUMER AWARENESS. FOR THE CINEMA COUNTY AS A WINE REGION. SO AGAIN WHY DOES MEDICINE A COUNTY NEED CONDUCTED LABELING. INCREASED RECOGNITION FOR EVERY ABA WITHIN MENDOCINO COUNTY. CONSISTENT MESSAGING EVERY WINERIES TELLING THE SAME STORY MENDOZA SCENE NOW. MEDICINE NET MANY MEN THE SIERRA COUNTY WINERIES ARE ALREADY DOING CONJUNCTIVE LABELING. IT IS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED IN NAPA SONOMA MONTEREY LODI IN PAST ROBLES. THE BENEFIT FROM OUR PARTNER WITH TOURISM VISIT MENDOCINO COUNTIES CONSIDER RULING CONSIDERABLE MARKETING EFFORTS AND DOLLARS WILL HAVE A GREATER IMPACT AND RESONANCE SAYING MEN TO SEE YOU KNOW MENDOCINO COUNTY. COME VISIT MENDOCINO COUNTY. MILLENNIALS WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE PLACEMENT UNIQUE HISTORY AND ITS UNIQUE STORY WE NEED TO TELL THEM WHERE THEY'RE GETTING THEIR WINES. BILL PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN OUR POSITION IN THE WORLD WINE MARKET AND INCREASE SALES AND FROM WINES FROM MENDOCINO COUNTY GRAPES. SO HOW WE GONNA ABOUT DEVELOPING A CONJUNCTIVE LABELING LAW FIRM IN THIS IN A COUNTY. WE REVIEWED HOW OTHER REGIONS CRAFTED THEIR PROGRAMS. WE POSTED SERIES OF REGIONAL TOWN HALL MEETINGS ALL AROUND BEN SEENA COUNTY WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS. WE LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS AND ADOPTED OUR PROPOSAL OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR FROM THOSE -- STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. AND ULTIMATELY WITH CREST CRAFTED A PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE EFFECTIVE YEAH IT IS NOT PROHIBITIVELY DIFF DIFFICULT. IN THE SHORT MENDOZA CENA OR MENDOCINO COUNTY MUST BE ON THE FRONT OR BACK LABEL. MEN THE CNO ALONE CAN BE USED IF THE SUB ABA'S LOCATED WITHIN THE MENDOCINO ABA. AND WE'VE -- PROVIDED A GENEROUS TIMELINE FOR COMPLIANCE DUE TO THE COST FOR LABEL CHANGE EXCEPT READ THAT LABELS MUST CONFORM TO THIS LAW BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THIS PROPOSAL WILL GO TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS. EVERY GROWING VITNER IN MENDOCINO COUNTY FOR A VOTE. NEXT MONTH IN JULY. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AND WE'RE CONFIDENT YOU'LL MAKE A LASTING THIS DIFFERENCE FROM ENCINO COUNTY AND WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THAT -- CENTER MCGUIRE HAS GIVEN TO OUR EFFORTS -- AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR AIDS NO YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING -- DILIGENTLY I WILL SAY TO SAY THE LEAST ON THIS ISSUE SO THIS WAS HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE AND I KNOW -- EACH OF US LOVE SCENE D. OF MINUTES YOU KNOW COUNTY. WRAPPED LIGHT RAIL IN SACRAMENTO I ONLY SEE YEAH LOOKS GREAT SO NICE. TO ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO MUCH WONDERFUL JOB TODAY. THIS IS GENERALLY NOW LIKE THEIR TURN IT OVER TO MISTER MICHAEL HE HE'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE EXACT ADDRESS FOR THE CINEMA COUNTY VENDORS CHENEY'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU SIR THANKS FOR YOUR WORK OF FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES IN YOUR FLOORS YOURS WELCOME. FANTASTIC THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME TODAY IT'S A REAL HONOR TO BE HERE. AND I WOULDN'T JUST TO START A LITTLE BIT AND SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CINEMA COUNTY VENDORS -- WE ARE ACTUALLY -- THREE COMPANIES IN ONE IF YOU LOOK AT IT WE'RE OBVIOUSLY -- ONE OF US AND WE WERE ONE OF SOME COUNTIES LARGEST TRADE ASSOCIATIONS OUR MISSION IS TO MARKET AND REPRESENTS AND I'M CONNIE WINDS IN WINERIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WELL ACTUALLY I ALSO -- AND EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES -- ACTIVATION COMPANY WE WE PRODUCE SOME OF THE LARGEST TRADE AS WELL AS CONSUMER WINE EVENTS THROUGHOUT CINEMA COUNTY AND ALSO SOME WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IS OUR FOUNDATION AS WELL -- I CAN TELL YOU I'M IN MY TWENTY NINTH YEAR OF BEING IN THE WINE INDUSTRY AND I CAN'T BE MORE PROUD OF OUR WINE INDUSTRY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HERE FOR THEIR GENEROSITY I CAN TELL YOU IN JUST THIS YEAR ALONE SO FAR. JUSTIN CINEMA COUNTY AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT CALIFORNIA IS DOING AS A WHOLE BUT JUSTIN CINEMA COUNTY. OUR FOUNDATION HAS DONATED OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO OVER SIXTY NONPROFITS THROUGHOUT CINEMA COUNTY SO IT'S IT'S A GREAT PRIDE TO BE HERE REPRESENTING CINEMA COUNTY WINE INDUSTRY TODAY. I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- THE MARKETS THAT -- WE HAVE NOW AS WELL AS SOME OF THE EMERGING MARKETS THAT WE SEE COMING -- DOWN THE ROAD -- WE THINK IT'S SOME KIND OF IT THERE'S THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME GOOD NEWS AND WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT THERE ARE. WAYS TO GROW OUR MARKETS -- THROUGHOUT THE WORLD COMING UP AND I WANT TO TOUCH ON NOT ONLY THE THE INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE BUT A LITTLE BIT ON THE DOMESTIC SIDE AS WELL. ON THE INTERNATIONAL SIDE. CURRENTLY OUR TOP INTERNATIONAL MARKETS -- FOR CALIFORNIA ONCE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE THE EUROPEAN UNION -- CANADA HONG KONG. JAPAN IN OF COURSE CHINA AS WELL. MEANWHILE THOSE KIND OF EXISTING MARKETS -- STILL HAVE MUCH ROOM FOR GROWTH AND THAT'S EXCITING IN ITSELF WE SEE SOME EMERGING MARKETS ON THE INTERNATIONAL FRONT AS WELL. MEXICO SOUTH KOREA [INAUDIBLE] INDIA. VIETNAM IN GERMANY ALL OF THOSE ARE SHOWING SIGNS OF INTERESTING GROWTH FOR FOR CALIFORNIA WINES AND THERE'S REASONS FOR THAT IF YOU LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE WINE CONSUMPTION IN MEXICO IS ON THE RISE. JUST A GREAT THING CURIOSITY FOR AMERICAN PRODUCTS IN GENERAL AS WELL AS WINE IN VIETNAM IS ON THE RISE. OUR OUR REPUTATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WINE REPUTATION IN SOUTH KOREA'S OF A PREMIUM NATURE. AND THEN OF COURSE THE INCREASE CONSUMER EDUCATION ABOUT CALIFORNIA WINES IN GENERAL AND ALL THESE COUNTRIES IS ON THE INCREASE SO THOSE ARE SOME EXCITING STATISTICS THERE TO TALK ABOUT. IN WITH THAT OUR WINERIES ARE LOOKING TO ENGAGE IN THESE MARKETS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS BUT THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND SOME OF THE PREVIOUS PANEL TALKED ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT ONE OF THEM IS THE THE WELL FUNDED PROMOTION OF WINES BY INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AS WE TALKED ABOUT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE. THE E. U. ALONE SPENDS OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN MARKETING PROMOTION AND GRAPES AS THE SUBSIDIES EACH YEAR -- SO THAT THAT'S A GREAT ASSISTANCE TO THAT MARKET OBVIOUSLY THE THE TERROR FROM TRADE FRICTIONS THAT WE C.. OUR CHALLENGE TO OUR INDUSTRY -- BREXIT UNCERTAINTY IS A CHALLENGE AND OF COURSE OUR OUR COMPETITIVE PRICE DISADVANTAGE EXPRESSLY IN ASIA MARKET NOW IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH -- ALL THE TIME AS WELL. HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU -- THAT WE WHEN WE HAVE SUCH GREAT RESOURCES AS OF IS THESE WONDERFUL ONE ASSOCIATIONS IN THE WINE INSTITUTE I THINK BY WORKING TOGETHER WITH. WITH THESE TYPE OF ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS OUR WINERIES ACROSS -- CALIFORNIA I THINK YOU'LL SEE SOME FANTASTIC GROWTH IN SOME OF THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN THE NEXT DECADE BECOMES WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. AND ALSO ON THE DOMESTIC SIDE WE ALL KNOW ABOUT MILLENNIALS AND SO FORTH WHILE I THINK PERSONALLY THAT THE THE POSITIVE IMPACT ON WINE SALES -- IN THE PAST YEAR OR SO WAS MAYBE A LITTLE OVER ESTIMATED FROM MILLENNIALS WE SEE THE WINE INDUSTRY NOW REALLY ENGAGING IN FORMATS TO PROMOTE. OUR WINDS TO MILLENNIALS IN WAYS THAT ARE ATTRACTIVE TO THEM -- I THINK FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE. WE ALL KNOW THAT MILLENNIALS ARE MORE DIGITALLY FOCUSED SO NOW YOU C. WINERIES GETTING INVOLVED IN MORE DIGITAL PLATFORMS TO COMMUNICATING WITH MILLENNIALS ALSO -- MILLENNIALS LIKE MORE CHOICES I MEAN I LIKE MORE CHOICES AND M. FAR FROM MILLENNIAL BUT SO YOU SEE THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY LOOKING TO PROVIDE MORE WINES BY THE GLASS ACROSS THE BOARD WHICH IS A GOOD THING AS WELL. ALSO WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL THE THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY. ORGANIC TO MILLENNIALS AND OTHERS AS WELL -- THAT'S A GREAT IMPORTANCE I CAN TELL YOU AND I CAN TELL YOU WERE VERY PROUD IN CINEMA COUNTY IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT MY COUNTERPARTS OF DONE. IN -- WITH CINEMA COUNTY GRAPE GROWERS AND CHRIS A CRUISE IN HER FANTASTIC TEAM WE ARE NOW OVER 95% VINEYARD SUSTAINABLE CERTIFIED IN CINEMA COUNTY. AND THAT WAS A FIVE YEAR GOAL THAT THEY MET IT'S IT'S JUST A FANTASTIC -- STATEMENT TO BE ABLE TO MARKET. AND THEN OF COURSE WE TALKED ABOUT WINERIES CREATING VARIOUS EXPERIENCES WELL ENGAGING THOSE MILLENNIALS IN CREATING THOSE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE ATTRACTIVE TO THEM ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND THEN OF COURSE JUST THE THE INCREASING CONVENIENCE -- MILLENNIALS ARE LACKING WINDS NOW WHETHER THEY BE IN CANS OR OTHER DELIVERY METHODS -- TO MAKE IT MORE CAN IT'S TO THEM WHETHER IT'S BY THE POOL ON THE LAKE OR WHOEVER MAYBE SO THE WIND INJURE INDUSTRY NOW IS ENGAGING I THINK IN A MUCH MORE -- POSITIVE IN IN PROMOTIONAL WAY TO ENGAGE THAT TYPE OF OF OF MARKET HERE. ALSO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE SEEING. IN OUR MARKETS IN RIGHT JOHNSON TOUCHED ON SOME OF THOSE -- NOT ONLY ARE WE COMPETING ON A GLOBAL SCALE WITH OUR WINDS AND WE WE COMPETE WITH LABOR ISSUES AS WELL ANOTHER CONCERNS AS RAY TALKED ABOUT. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE YOU HERE IN CINEMA COUNTY I KNOW OTHER ASSOCIATIONS ARE DEALING WITH IT IS THE PROBLEM PROBLEMATIC PERMIT PROCESS WE ALL KNOW THERE NEEDS TO BE REGULATIONS AND SO FORTH BUT THE PROCESS ITSELF HAS BECOME A REAL CHALLENGE THAT OUR ORGANIZATION SPENDS. QUITE A BIT OF TIME ADDRESSING -- EVERY WEEK -- I CAN TELL YOU OF ONE EXIT RECENT EXAMPLE WE HAD A WINERY -- IT WAS AN EXISTING WINERY THAT WENT TO BUILD A NEW FACILITY -- AND THAT -- PROCESS TWO SIX YEARS. OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO GET THE YES. INTO THE POINT NOW FOR THAT PROJECT WHILE IT IS APPROVED -- IS DELAYED A YEAR BECAUSE OF THE MONEY SPENT ON JUST GETTING THAT YES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT CINEMACON INVENTORS OF WAYS AND WE'RE INTO CS TO COAL TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTY OFFICIALS AND AND OTHERS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN REFINE AND REVIEW THAT PROCESS. IN TO BRING FOR A PROGRAM THAT THAT THAT LIMITS THAT TIME LINE AS WELL AS EDUCATE -- POTENTIAL APPLICANT ON WHAT THAT MAXIMUM COSTS COULD POSSIBLY BE SO THEY CAN BUDGET AND AND PLAN ON THAT AS WELL. AND THEN RAY ALSO TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE IMPORTANCE OF DIRECT TO CONSUMER. I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE DIRECT CONSUMER IS ALL ABOUT SURVIVAL FOR THIS WINE INDUSTRY. IT'S NOT ABOUT THROWING PARTIES IT'S NOT ABOUT NECESSARILY PAN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS TRULY ABOUT SURVIVAL IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE FAMILY OWNED WINERY -- SICK IT'S 61%. OF THE REVENUES IS DIRECT TO CONSUMER -- SO. SOME OF THE PERMIT PROCESS IS IT REGARDING DIRECT CONSUMER FOR EXAMPLE IS ALSO -- PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO ENGAGE IN AND REVIEW FOR EXAMPLE ON THE WINERY EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES SIDE -- I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT HOW THE MARKETS CHANGE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THE NUMBER OF WHOLESALERS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES HAS DRAMATICALLY BEEN REDUCED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. WHILE THE NUMBER OF WINERIES HAS INCREASED SO EVEN IF I WANT -- WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION DOESN'T MEAN I'M GOING TO GET IT SO THAT DIRECTORS CONSUMER -- CHALLENGE OR CHANNEL IS MY LIFE'S BLOOD TO SURVIVE ABILITY WITH ABOUT ONE MINUTE. YES ABSOLUTELY. NO IN ONE MINUTE ONE MINUTE ONE MINUTE YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ATKINS I COULD KEEP GOING ON DOING GREAT. WELL THANK YOU WELL BUT IN THE IN IN IN SUMMARY I I CAN TELL YOU ON THESE PROBLEMS AND OTHERS WE ARE EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO WORK COLLECTIVELY WITH OUR WITH OUR NEIGHBORS WITH OTHER ASSOCIATIONS IN WITH OUR POLITICAL -- REPRESENTATIVES TO BE ABLE TO COORDINATE ANSWERS TO THESE PROBLEMS AND OTHERS BUT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME NO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR VERY GRATEFUL THINKING TRAINING FOR BEING HERE FOR ALL YOUR WORK. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE MOVING ON TO MISTER SCHMELZER ASSISTANCE RATHER HE IS THE VICE PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA STATE RELATIONS FOR THE WINE INSTITUTE. WE'VE HEARD -- CHALLENGES IN EMERGING MARKETS AS WELL THE APPELLATIONS FROM CINNAMON IN THE SCENE OR LAKE NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE -- MORE GLOBAL VIEW ON THE STATEWIDE LEVEL DISCLOSURE THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE AT FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND GERMAN INTER WOMAN -- PLEASURE TO BE HERE -- SO I'M GONNA BE DOING MY BEST FAKE IT TILL I MAKE IT TO TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. AND I'M -- SO BE PATIENT WITH ME -- ANYWAY I FIRST WANT -- TO JUST -- GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF PERSPECTIVE OF WORK CALIFORNIA STANDS AND SO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND AND A LITTLE BIT ONE INSTITUTES ROLE IN -- PROMOTING THAT ALL -- TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BEAT THAT FOR THE TELEVISION AUDIENCE AND WE'RE ALL AWARE ABOUT -- ANYWAY -- I THINK YOU'RE ALL AWARE CALIFORNIA IS THE FOURTH LARGEST PRODUCER OF WINE IN THE WORLD -- IN 85% -- THE WINE -- PRETTY C. UNITED STATES COMES FROM CALIFORNIA AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS CONVERSATION 95% OF THE WINE -- EXPORTED FROM THE UNITED STATES IT COMES FROM CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S DUE TO THIS -- OUTSIZED ROLE THE CALIFORNIA PLAYS IN WINE EXPORTS -- THAT IT'S COME TO PASS THE WINE INSTITUTE -- PLACE SUCH A LARGE ROLE AND HELPING WITH OUR EXPORT MARKETING -- MY COLLEAGUE HONOR COMFORT WHO UNFORTUNATELY WASN'T -- ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY -- WE SET UP -- FOR ON BEHALF OF ONE INSTITUTE -- THEY WANT TO MENTION JUST SOME OF THE HUGE NUMBER OF EVENTS THAT -- WE BOTH -- HOST TO PARTICIPATE IN -- TO SUPPORT -- CALIFORNIA'S EXPORT POTENTIAL I HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- JUST THIS YEAR -- WE POSTED THE SOMMELIERS FROM MEXICO -- WE POSTED FOLKS FROM THE U. K. FROM THE NORDIC REGION'S -- FROM JAPAN UK AND IRELAND. AND COMING IN EARLY -- TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE FOLKS COMING FROM ASIA AND A EUROPEAN MEDIA GROUP -- TOURING ACROSS THE WORLD -- WE PARTICIPATE -- AND HOST EVENTS IN ASIA CANADA EUROPE JAPAN MEXICO U. K. AND IRELAND SO COVER HUGE SWAP -- OF THE WORLD -- PUSHING THE MESSAGE THAT BOTH CALIFORNIA AND AND OFTEN IN OUR OLD -- PROMOTE -- AMERICAN -- ONE ABROAD. OF COURSE -- THERE ARE CHALLENGES OUT THERE THAT ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR US AND WHILE WE ARE VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT -- OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS OUR EXPORTS HAVE GONE UP OVER ACHIEVEMENT. UNFORTUNATELY IT THE TREND HAS BEEN DOWNWARD THESE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS I'LL LET YOU SPEAK TO WHY. OF THIS -- LAST YEAR IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR EXAMPLE -- THE VALUE -- WINE EXPORTS -- WITH DOWN FOUR POINT 6%. AND YEAH THAT'S A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE TRADE WAR STUFF THAT -- WE'RE GONNA ENGAGE TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT HERE -- SO YOU KNOW WHERE OUR PRIMARY MARKETS ARE -- THE E. U. -- HOW'S THE CROWN -- FOR THE SINGLE LARGEST REGION -- BUYER OF CALIFORNIA WINE -- IN WE MICHAEL MENTIONED THIS IS WELL CANADA'S SECOND -- BECAUSE HONG KONG JAPAN CHINA MEXICO GOT NUMBERS FOR THOSE -- SHOULD YOU BE INTERESTED -- MANY OF OUR CHALLENGES STEM FROM THE FACT THAT -- THERE'S TERRORISTS AND OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES -- THAT WE ARE FACED WITH WHEN WE PUSH OUR PRODUCTS ABROAD. AND PRODUCTS COMING IN THE UNITED STATES OFTEN DON'T FACE ANYTHING SIMILAR -- FOR EXAMPLE -- THE TERROR FOR A BOTTLE STILL WIND COMING INTO CALIFORNIA IS FIVE CENTS -- IT'S OVER DOUBLE THAT -- FOR US TO SEND WINE INTO EUROPE -- JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE -- THAT NUMBER. CLIENTS EXPONENTIALLY DEPENDING ON WHAT COUNTRIES ARE TALKING ABOUT -- IN JAPAN THAT TERROR PHRASES -- 15% NOW -- THERE WERE HAPPY THAT THERE'S ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN THAT PERHAPS THE DRESS THAT -- IN INDIA -- NUMBERS A HUNDRED AND VISITED THERE I DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF CALIFORNIA WHAT [INAUDIBLE] YES. YOUR THERE'S WELL THAT'S RIGHT -- ANYWAY -- I'LL ENDEAVOR TO TALK -- REGION BY REGION -- WHERE WHERE WE FACE CHALLENGES AND -- AND HAPPY TAKE SOME QUESTIONS A DEEPER DIVE IN SOME OF THIS -- THE EUROPEAN UNION -- POSES CHALLENGES -- NOT SOUND ON THE TERROR OF ISSUE THAT I THAT I MENTIONED -- BUT ALSO AND AND MICHAEL AGAIN YOU TOUCHED ON THIS -- THEY THEY MAINTAIN A HUGE ADVANTAGE AND US AND THE SUPPORT THEY GET FOR MARKETING OF THE PRODUCT -- YOU KNOW WE DO SOMERSAULTS WHEN WE GET A SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR GRANT -- BUT COMPARED TO WHAT WAS THE NUMBER YOU'RE USING LIKE A TOTAL YEAH. YEAH. AND IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES SO -- YOU KNOW THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR US OBVIOUSLY -- THERE'S A THERE'S OTHER LITTLE THINGS IN THE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION -- YOU KNOW GOD BLESS MY LIVE VISITING EUROPE AND AND YOU KNOW -- THEY ENDEAVOR TO GET AT THIS BUT IT'S LIKE A DEATH FROM A THOUSAND CUTS KIND OF APPROACH HERE -- THEY MAINTAIN AN ABSOLUTE MONOPOLY. ON THE USE OF GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS -- FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU CAN USE ON A BOTTLE OF WINE -- CALIFORNIA -- ONE CAN'T SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE WORD CHATEAU ON IT IF YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT IN EUROPE AND THERE ARE OVER A THOUSAND OF THESE TYPE OF OF LABELS THAT -- ARE ALL PART OF THE RULES. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE. TO WAIT WE RESEARCH THE THEY CAN'T SAY CLASSIC OR CREAM WHICH I CAN'T EVEN RECALL SEEING ON A BOTTLE OF WINE BUT ANYWAY BUT YOU KNOW IT'S JUST LIKE LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY POSE CHALLENGES -- INTERESTINGLY ALSO IN EUROPE -- THEY HAVE A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE USE OF CROP PROTECTION MATERIALS -- THAT THAT -- WE USED TO PROTECT THE GRAPES AND HAVE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS -- ASKED WINERIES TO TEST THEIR WINES FOR CERTAIN CHEMICALS THAT MAY EXIST IN A WINE AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE IS ALMOST ALWAYS COME BACK MAYBE NEGATIVE. BUT IT'S A GREAT EXPENSE TO ANYONE -- TO HAVE TO DO THIS JUST -- TO BILL TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE EXPORT MARKET. AND JUST HOPE THAT THREAT HOVERING OVER THAT THAT WE MAY I ASK SOMEBODY TO DO THAT HAS AN EFFECTIVE DEPRESSING -- SO -- I WENT INTO JUST ONE MORE THING -- YOU -- LIKELY RIGHT IN THE NEWS THIS WHOLE BUSINESS -- ABOUT AIRBUS AND THE TRADE ISSUES THAT THAT'S CREATING -- BELIEVE OR NOT -- CAL CALIFORNIA WINE -- MAY GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT IS AS WELL AND WE COULD -- SEE ACTUALLY I EVEN A HIGHER TERROR ON OUR PRODUCTS GOING INTO EUROPEAN UNION. AS YOU KNOW KIND OF THE FRIENDLY FIRE FROM -- THAT EXCHANGE -- YEAH IT'S ONE CAUGHT UP IN IT WHICH IS A REAL SHAME -- IN CHINA OF YOU KNOW WHAT SPOKE TO THE COMMITTEE -- LAST YEAR ABOUT THIS ISSUE -- THAT'S GOING FROM BAD TO WORSE -- YOU KNOW IT I THINK A YEAR AND A HALF AGO -- THE TERROR OF ON CALIFORNIA ONE IN A CHINA WAS LIKE 15% -- BEGINNING IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR WERE AT NINETY THREE SO. BUT THE UGLY AND IS THE REAL SHAME THERE -- CHINA'S SOMETHING LIKE THE IT'S DOWN THE LIST A LITTLE BIT AS FAR AS WINE EXPORTS FOR CALIFORNIA. FOR ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO LIKE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH IS LIKE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL THERE AND WE'VE PLAYED SO MUCH GROUND WORK. AND TO HAVE YOU KNOW KIND OF OUR GROUND TAKEN OUT FROM UNDER US -- IN THOSE UPPER WITH THIS TRADE WAR. IS A TERRIBLE SHAME AND REALLY HURTS OF THE FUTURE POTENTIAL -- FOR CALIFORNIA WINE EXPORTS SO -- THAT'S A TOUGH ONE AND AND HONESTLY I DON'T SEE THE END OF THAT ONE RIGHT NOW SO -- TAKING CUTS ON ALLEN IF YOU PLAY -- ON THE MORE POSITIVE -- THINGS I CAN TALK ABOUT -- WITH BEN AND OKAY. THERE'S LOTS TO TALK ABOUT WITH POSITIVE RIGHT NOW SO THAT -- AT FIRST SOMEWHAT IRONICALLY. THIS -- BRIGGS IT BUSINESS IN THE U. K. -- ACTUALLY CREATE SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR US -- YOU HEARD ME -- GIVE YOU CHAPTER AND VERSE ABOUT OUR CHALLENGES WITH THE E. U. -- SHOULD BRAGS THAT FINALLY GET FINALIZED -- THIS ACTUALLY CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY -- WITH THE U. K. AND WE HOPE -- CREATE BETTER -- TRADE AGREEMENTS -- WITH THEM AND AND WE THINK THAT WE ACTUALLY WELL -- AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO MENTION REAL -- QUICKLY AND ACTUALLY IT. WE HAVE CHALLENGES IN IRELAND THEY'RE THEY'RE TOUGH BUT I WANT TO MENTION ONE MORE POSITIVE THING -- IN CANADA -- WHICH WE'VE THE LATEST AGREEMENT WITH THE I FORGET WHAT IT'S CALLED THE IT'S A GOOD NAFTA REPLACEMENT THAT'S BEEN THAT'S BEEN A GOOD THING -- BOTH FOR MEXICAN AND CANADIAN TRADE AND WE ARE HAPPY JUST TO SEE THAT -- HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME REGIONAL STRUGGLES -- WITHOUT IN ONTARIO AND QUEBEC -- ANY RATE -- I KNOW SEVERAL OF YOU ARE PROBABLY WARRIOR SOUNDS WHICH YOU KNOW. SORRY YOU LOST BUT THERE IS A GOOD THING THAT HAPPENED HERE. AND THAT THERE WAS A BACK BETWEEN -- SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI AND THE PRIME MINISTER I DO NOT WRITE JUSTIN TRUDEAU. AND THE BETH FROM CALIFORNIA WAS IF THE WARRIORS LOST YOU KNOW WHICH IS TOO BAD SORRY M. KINGS FOUND BUT WHATEVER -- WE'RE ON A UPWARD TREND. THANK YOU SHE KNOWS. ANY RATE -- IS A SOMEWHAT JERKY NOTE THOUGH BUT THE BUT SPEAKING HELLO C. -- AS A RESULT OF THE WARRIORS LOSING THE THE SILVER LINING IS THAT AND THAT IS THAT -- FROM MISTER TRUDEAU RECEIVED -- SEVERAL CASES OF CALIFORNIA WINE WHICH WILL UNDOUBTEDLY TURNED INTO YOU CHOOSE WE HAVE IN CANADA AROUND. IT ALL IN MY PRESENTATION THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SMELLS ARE WHAT WE LIKE TO GO TO DO NOW IS OPEN UP TO THE COMMITTEE -- WE'RE GONNA START WITH GERMAN GUY WITH ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR. THINK OF THIS IS KIND OF MORE FOR THE NEWER APPELLATIONS -- IS THEIR UNIQUE CHALLENGES NEW NEWER APPELLATIONS THAT -- DON'T SEEM AS PREVALENT IN. YEAH WITH THE WITH THE OLDER ONES. SO -- WHAT I WOULD SAY IS TRYING TO CREATE THE BRAND AWARENESS FOR A BRAND NEW APPELLATION -- BOTH HAS ITS -- YOU KNOW CHALLENGES BUT ALSO OPPORTUNITIES I THINK A PETALUMA GAP. IN CINEMA COUNTY WHICH IS DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB OF MARKETING -- I THINK IT MAYBE THEY ALSO ARE THEY ARE TIED TO AN ACTUAL PLACE THE PEOPLE MAY HAVE HEARD OF BUT THEY HAVE A VERY UNIQUE STORY TO TELL -- AND SAID THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY DO A GREAT JOB OF CREATING YOUR BRAND WHEN YOU'RE A BRAND NEW APPELLATION AND YOU'RE VERY FOCUSED ON WHAT IT IS. AND WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE PRODUCING -- SO I SEE THAT AS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COLDER REGIONS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND SUCH IS MAN'S YOU KNOW LAKE CINEMA -- YOU KNOW WE'RE KIND OF LIKE YEAH YEAH YEAH YOU KNOW SO HOW DO WE GET THROUGH THE NOISE. AND CREATE THE AWARENESS OF WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT -- AND BECAUSE A LARGER REGIONS HAVE. THE SMALLER ABA'S THAT HAVE THE UNIQUENESS IT'S IT'S KIND OF A CHALLENGE TO BRING THAT ALL UNDER ONE UMBRELLA [INAUDIBLE] WHAT IS? I AM SURE -- COUPLE QUICK -- COMMENTS FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK DEBORAH FOR WHAT SHE'S DONE FOR LAKE COUNTY -- WE REPRESENT ALL OF US OF REPRESENT LAKE COUNTY AND THERE'S BEEN SO MANY THINGS AND UP THERE AND TRYING TO GET ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOING UP THERE SO. BUT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT -- IT'S AMAZING THE WANTING TO STRIP THERE. AND I WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING UP THERE I HAD NO CLUE AND THEN I HAD THE BEST WINE WHITE WINE THERE WAS A THE BEST WHITE ONES IN CALIFORNIA. REALLY COUNTY AND I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT OR MORE SO I APPLAUD YOU AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE INVITED TO WILK AGREE TO DISAGREE BUT AND YOU KNOW I CAN SAY THAT IS THAT I DON'T REPRESENT. A MID TO SENIOR COUNTY A LITTLE TINY FEET WELL ACTUALLY I CAN WITH THAT BUT WE CAN. BUT I I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT WHAT YOU'VE DONE UP THERE TO BRING -- SOME BIT OF TOURISM AND BUT IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT TRYING TO REALLY GET IT GOING AND GETTING THE MARKETING GOING UP THERE -- I WAS A I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FARM WORKERS. AND I THOUGHT THOSE WERE THE FIRST TIMES I HAD SEEN THE LEADERSHIP ROLES OF THE FARM WORKERS ARE TAKING ON AN GRADUATING FROM A CLASS AND THAT MADE MY HEART FULL AND I THOUGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING UP THERE I'D LIKE TO BE INVITED TO WHENEVER YOU'RE EVENTS AND I'D LIKE TO SIT IN THE AUDIENCE IN HERE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH LOVE TO HAVE YOU AND EXTEND THE INVITATION TO ALL THREE OF YOU OF COURSE THAT AT ANY. TIME. BUT ONE THING THAT WE ARE WORKING ON THE WOOD WILL INCLUDE ALL OF YOU -- IS A SCENIC HIGHWAY. FOR ONE TWENTY EIGHT AND THE REASON THAT CAME UP IS BECAUSE OF ALL THE FIRES AND SO MANY OF OUR FARMERS A WINERY SAID WE NEED TO GET SOMETHING GOING FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SO WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF OF GETTING -- SCENIC HIGHWAY APPROVED FOR THE MENDOCINO COAST ALL THE WAY TO MY HOMETOWN WINTERS CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THAT WE'RE JUST GOT TO GET SOME THINGS NAIL DOWN THAT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONE THROUGH ALL THIS THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP. WITH MARKETING OF OUR WINES IN CALIFORNIA IS IMPORTANT SO -- I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE RIGHT NOW I'M SURE YOU TALK AFTERWARDS BUT THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT WITH ALL OF YOU DO. INTENSE JUST THE BEST TO COME TO SEE THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS PICTURES ACCOUNTS ON THE HEAD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH VENTURE I IF YOU ALL CAN TALK ABOUT. AS THE ENHANCED FOCUS AND DIRECT SALES -- AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND THEN AT THE MARKETING CAMPAIGN THAT GOES WITH THAT DENTURE THAT WE ARE GETTING. TALES IN THE TASTING ROOMS RIGHT TO BE A PURCHASE THAT WIND SO CAN YOU GIVE US SOME -- DIRECTIONAL WHERE EACH OF THE COUNTIES ARE GOING. PUSHING THAT MARKETING BRINGING FOLKS IN THE COUNTY AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR ME THE WINERIES REGARDS DISTRICT SALES. I DO WE'LL START WITH EVER MORE CAR WAY DOWN MIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO THE LIGHTNING ROUND. AND SO THE WHOLE WAY SO IT'S GREAT PLEASE. YEAH I THINK -- FOR REGION LIKE OURS DIRECT TO CONSUMERS IS HUGE IT'S SO IMPORTANT IN THIS DAY AND AGE AND ALL OF OUR WINERIES UNDERSTAND THAT -- THEY FROM A TOURISM PERSPECTIVE YOU CAN GET A VISITOR TO THE COUNTY -- THEY WILL DIRECT THEM TO OTHER NEIGHBORING WINERIES AND THERE'S A VERY COLLABORATIVE SPIRIT THERE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM THE BAY AREA TO COME UP THROUGH EITHER SO NORMAL OR NOT BUT TO COME TO LAKE -- FOR VERY SMALL WINERIES IT'S CRITICAL IT'S THEIR LIFE BLOOD -- WE ARE SEEN TURNOVER AND THINK THIS IS A TREND IN THE INDUSTRY -- WHERE? OUR OLDER GENERATIONS MAY STICK WITH HELLO A ONE CLUB MEMBERSHIP OVER YEARS WERE SEEN MORE TURNOVER NOW I THINK. AND AND I'M SURE OTHERS ON THE PANEL CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT TO THAT SO THAT IS A CONCERN WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT DIRECTING SUMMER ONE CLUB IS A BIG PART OF THAT. SO -- AGAIN BEING -- DEMOGRAPHICALLY REALLY. CHALLENGED -- REGIONS GETTING SOMEONE IN THE TASTING ROOM IS HE KEEPING -- IS YOU KNOW SUPER IMPORTANT I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES -- FOR SMALL TO MID SIZE WINERIES IS THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE FOLLOWING UP WITH THAT CONSUMER THEY'VE HAD A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE THEY LOVE THE WINE. MAYBE YOU MAIL -- TWO TO THREE ONE CUP SHIPMENTS HERE BUT WHAT DO YOU DO IN. THE TWELVE MONTHS A YEAR TO ENGAGE THEM TO KEEP THEM LOYAL TO TELL YOUR STORY. AND MOST OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES -- THE WINE MAKERS WORKING THE TASTING ROOM AND THE WIFE IS DOING THIS AND THAT AND YOU KNOW TO TO BE. AS SOPHISTICATED AS YOU NEED TO BE THESE DAYS TO COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE I THINK IS IS REALLY ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AS I SAID EARLIER DIRECT CONSUMER IS ALL ABOUT SURVIVAL FOR WINERIES I THINK AND I CAN TELL YOU IS BERNADETTE SAID WINERIES ARE ARE ENGAGING NOW MORE AND MORE ON THOSE YEAR LONG TOUCH POINTS WITH CONSUMERS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT. BUT ALSO ONE OF THE INITIATIVES THAT WE'RE UNDERTAKING IN CINEMA COUNTY OF ADVENTURES. IS IS CREATING A SET OF DEFINITION OF WHAT AN ADVANTIS VERSUS ONE OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY IS AND THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND CINEMA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE IF A WINERY WANTS TO HAVE A WEDDING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT'S IN THE VAN HE NEEDS TO GO THROUGH THE PERMIT PROCESS IT IN AND HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TYPE OF SIGN OFF. FOR FOUR FROM THE FROM THE COUNTY HOWEVER IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT DOING -- A TRADE LUNCH OR A WINE PICK UP PARTY -- FOR YOUR CONSUMERS AND SO FORTH WE SEE THAT AS A WAY OF THAT'S A BUSINESS ACTIVITY YOU'RE GETTING YOUR PRODUCT -- TO THE CONSUMER IT'S NOT ABOUT BIG PARTIES AND SO FORTH ABOUT ENGAGING THAT CONSUMER AND HOPEFULLY -- INCREASING YOUR YOUR SALES BASE SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COUNTY ON A LOT TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT SET OF DEFINITIONS -- BECAUSE ONE OF THE OTHER CONCERNS FROM THE CHARITABLE ASPECT THAT WE SEE IS -- LET'S SAY MY WINERY HAS -- TEN EVENTS THAT I CAN DO ALL RIGHT NOW IF I HAVE ONE A BUSINESS ACTIVITY THAT MIGHT BE. COUNTED AS ONE OF MY EVENTS HOWEVER AS WE ALL KNOW ONE REASON ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR VENUES FOR CHARITABLE FUND RAISERS. IF I GET MY MEDS CUT BACK TO FIVE I CAN TELL YOU WHICH ONES ARE GOING TO GET CUT I HAVE TO HAVE THOSE FIVE TO GOOGLE MY BUSINESS SO THAT IMPACT ROLES ALL THE WAY TO THE COMMUNITY. SO IT'S JUST A THOUGHT NO THANK YOU SO MUCH MICHAEL AND I WAS AT THE ORIGINAL KICK OFF MEETING I THINK IT WAS EITHER SEVEN OR SEVEN HALF YEARS AGO ON THIS ISSUE. SO NO THIS IS BEEN A FOCUS OF THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M MISHRA QUICKLY. I WILL BE VERY QUICKLY -- ONE THING -- I WANTED TO THANK YOU ALL FOR SUPPORTING LEGISLATION THAT'S GOING TO HELP FOLKS WITH THEIR DIRECT TO CONSUMER -- WORK WHICH IS THIS SUPPORT OF CENTER GLAZER. GLAZER IS SP TWO SIXTY FOUR WHICH ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL TASTING ROOM AND HOPEFULLY ADDITIONAL DIRECT TO CONSUMER. TASTINGS AND SO FAR BEEN GOING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH THAT. AND ALSO PART OF THE WORK ONE INSTITUTE DOES -- THE YOU MAY NOT SEE IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY -- WE FIGHT THE FIGHT TO ENSURE THAT -- THESE BOOKS ARE ABLE TO SELL THE WIND TO CONSUMERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHICH IS A STATE BY STATE BY. THANK YOU SO MUCH HUESO JERICHO GET ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO OUR SECOND PANEL PLEASE NICE JOB. HE WOULD JUST HAVE SOME TIME BLOCKED OFF FOR ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS IF ANYBODY WISHES -- TO SAY ANYTHING OR MAKE SOME PUBLIC COMMENTS -- PLEASE STEP FORWARD. I'LL BE VERY BRIEF BOB MIKE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ONE GROUP GROWERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND USER SO THE STRONGEST VOICES FOR THE INDUSTRY IN THE CAPITAL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK -- THE THE ISSUE OF CULTIVATING NEXT GENERATION Y. LEADERS. IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- THIS WEEK WE HAD OUR SUMMER CONFERENCE HERE IN CINEMA WE'RE THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT CAME UP OVER OVER OVER AGAIN WAS LABOR. AND LABOR FOR GROWERS IS A HUGE ISSUE AND LOOK AT THE NEXT GENERATION IT'S A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS COST. THE COSTS ARE INCREASING AT 90% -- MANDATED IN LAW AND THIS NOT A COST IS PASSED ON THE THE COST IS PASSED ON TO THE WINERY THAT'S A COST MORE BY THE GROWER THAT AFFECTS THE BOTTOM LINE. THEN YOU LOOK AT AVAILABILITY OF WORKERS. PART OF THAT IS I WILL TRY TO FIND MORE WAYS OF TREATING THE NEXT GENERATION OF WORKERS WERE LOOKING AT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ALL KINDS OF INNOVATIVE WAYS OF OF OF MAKING THE NEXT GROUP OF WORKERS -- EDUCATED IN HOW TO I WORK FOR OUR OF THE WINE INDUSTRY IS LIKE A TREE TO BILL COUPLE YEARS AGO ON THIS ISSUE -- IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND I ARE JUST CONTINUE THAT WORK. THAT'S ALSO TECHNOLOGY TO EXTENT THAT WE CAN USE TECHNOLOGY TO TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND HOW WE I WORK IN THE VINEYARDS AND GET MORE PRODUCTION ALL THE VENEERS THAT CAN POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE DEMAND OF THE WORKFORCE. SAY WITH MECHANIZATION WITHOUT WELL THE THING WITH -- HARVEST READING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ALL OF THAT CAN HELP REDUCE THE DEMAND OF THE WORKFORCE. AND THEN AS USUAL HOUSING EVERY ADD WORKER NEEDS A HOME AND CALIFORNIA IS SUFFERING WITH NOT ADEQUATE HOUSING FRAG WORKERS -- MANY GROWERS ARE MOVING TO THE H. TWO WAY PROGRAM WHICH IS A GUEST WORKER PROGRAM AND THAT PROGRAM REQUIRES THAT THE GORE PROVIDE THE HOUSING DIRECTLY FOR THE WORKER. THAT'S A INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE PROCESS SO IT DOESN'T BOTHER GROVER'S BUT IT DEMONSTRATES THE BREWERS COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING HOUSING FOR THE WORKERS AND VERY MUCH NEEDED SO. WE LOOK AT THE NEXT GENERATION AND THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR THE GROWERS LABOR HAS TO BE REALLY HIGH ANALYST THANK YOU GET FOR YOUR ALL YOUR WORKING THIS ISSUE THANK YOU.
