BONDAGE WAS MORE EFFICIENT. ON

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:54.658
THERE'S ALSO A- SINCE EVERY

A SEPARATE FROM A PREVIOUS YEAR.

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.078
IF YOU WERE A NEW CARRIER ON THE

PREVIOUS YEAR SO THERE'S NOT A

00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:19.049
CARE SURCHARGE MECHANISM. AND

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.817
RATHER LET A NEW CARRIER SALAS

00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:22.552
PRODUCT BELOW THE SURCHARGE RATE

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:25.255
FOR A YEAR WHICH IS NOT. FAIR TO

OF WHEN A NEW COMPANY BECOMES

01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:05.874
WE UNDERSTAND WHY LEGISLATORS

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:08.276
MIGHT NOT BE READY TO MAKE THAT

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:09.244

THAT REASON WE WOULD BE WILLING

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:17.119

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.714

EXTEND IT FOR TWO YEARS. AT THIS

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:48.683
