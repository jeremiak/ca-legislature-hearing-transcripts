OPERATE AN OVERSEAS SIX DELIVERY

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:27.819
SYSTEM SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:28.920
REALLY BIG CONSEQUENTIAL

00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:30.221
PROGRAMS --

00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:32.457
IN THE STATE WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE

00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:33.625
SIX DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT WERE

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:36.528
LITTLE BIT --

THERE'S A FROM SERVICE AND

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:42.534
PEOPLE THINK THAT MEDI CAL

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.235
BASICALLY BREAKS DOWN INTO THOSE

00:26:44.302 --> 00:26:45.770
TWO DELIVERY SYSTEMS BUT I LIKE

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:46.838
TO REMIND PEOPLE.

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:48.273
THAT BAY ON FEE FOR SERVICE IN

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.374
MANAGED CARE WE HAVE THE MENTAL

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:50.675
HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH IS

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:52.210
COMPOSED OF FIFTY SIX COUNTY

00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:53.378
MENTAL HEALTH PLANS.

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:54.479
ON EACH OF THOSE COUNTY MENTAL

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:56.514
HEALTH PLANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:58.483
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.585
THEY CAN TAKE THE SHAPE OF BEING

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:01.820
A COUNTY THAT'S PARTICIPATING IN

00:27:01.886 --> 00:27:03.288
OUR ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:04.055
THROUGH THE ORGANIZED DELIVERY

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:05.690
SYSTEM WHICH IS A SEPARATE

00:27:05.757 --> 00:27:07.225
MANAGED CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM.

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:08.727
AS OPPOSED TO BEING A COUNTY

00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:10.195
THAT IS DOING IN ON WHAT WE CALL

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:12.297
STATE PLAN DRUG MEDICAL SERVICES

00:27:12.364 --> 00:27:12.864
WHICH ARE FIVE STATE PLAN

00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:13.999
SERVICES.

00:27:14.065 --> 00:27:15.233
THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE DENTAL ADD

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.368
DELIVERY SYSTEM WE HAVE

00:27:16.434 --> 00:27:17.469
CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES

00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:19.004
AND SO WHEN YOU START TO LOOK

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.438
ACROSS THE SPECTRUM.

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:22.374
OF WHO ARE BENEFICIARIES ARE OF

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.641
WHICH WE ARE THE LARGEST

00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:25.210
PUBLICLY FINANCED PROGRAM IN THE

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:26.911
NATION BEHIND MEDICARE SERVING

00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:28.747
OVER THIRTEEN MILLION

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:29.748
CALIFORNIANS.

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.116
IT GETS REALLY COMPLICATED

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:32.684
REALLY QUICKLY I THINK THAT

00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:34.386
THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST AND

00:27:34.452 --> 00:27:35.720
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:39.157
IN INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFER FROM --

00:27:39.224 --> 00:27:40.191
MENTAL ILLNESS ESPECIALLY

00:27:40.258 --> 00:27:41.693
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS BECAUSE

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.561
OF THE CONSEQUENCE AND THE

00:27:43.628 --> 00:27:44.763
IMPACT TO OTHER --

00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:46.731
BOTH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN

00:27:46.798 --> 00:27:47.932
THE STATE AS WELL AS TO THE

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:49.401
INDIVIDUAL SUFFERING FROM THE

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:50.568
ILLNESS.

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:52.837
SO WHEN YOU STOP TO OUR MENTAL

00:27:52.904 --> 00:27:54.439
HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM --

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:56.107
THERE AND YOUR AGENDA DOES A

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:59.010
REALLY NICE JOB AS NOTING IT --

00:27:59.077 --> 00:28:01.112
THERE ARE SEVERAL CONSEQUENTIAL

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:03.681
FINANCING SOURCES THAT HELP.

00:28:03.748 --> 00:28:07.252
UNDER GIRD THAT ENTIRE DELIVERY

00:28:07.318 --> 00:28:09.187
REALIGNMENT FUNDING SOURCES

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:09.721
THERE'S THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:11.689
SERVICES ACT THERE'S SOME STATE

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:12.857
GENERAL FUND THERE'S MENTAL

00:28:12.924 --> 00:28:14.492
HEALTH BLOCK GRANT AND THEN

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:15.093
OBVIOUSLY THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.661
COMPONENT --

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:17.896
FOR WHICH WE WOULD BE AS

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:19.764
COMPLETELY REMISS TO NOT MENTION

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:22.333
AS THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND WHEN

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.035
YOU DO THINGS WITH MEDICAID

00:28:24.102 --> 00:28:25.236
FEDERAL FUNDS.

00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:26.905
AS YOU WILL QUICKLY ALSO

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:28.673
APPRECIATE IS THE RULES AND THE

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.075
COMPLEXITY AROUND HOW THOSE

00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:31.076
FUNDS ARE USED IN THE

00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:32.377
DOCUMENTATION THAT IS REQUIRED

00:28:32.444 --> 00:28:33.745
IN ORDER FOR THOSE FUNDS TO BE

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:34.646
DRAWN DOWN.

00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:36.981
IS SOME OF THE REASONS WHY WE

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.149
HAVE THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE.

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:40.585
SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT --

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:42.220
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:43.955
CARE SERVICES.

00:28:44.022 --> 00:28:45.323
OVERSEEN FIFTY SIX CAN MENTAL

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.658
HEALTH PLANS THE FIRST ISSUE IS

00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:47.659
IS THAT THERE'S FIFTY SIX OF

00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:49.027
THEM -- AND

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:50.829
THERE'S A LOT OF THEM AND ONE

00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:52.263
COUNTIES MENTAL HEALTH --

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.631
PROGRAM IS ONE COUNTIES MENTAL

00:28:53.698 --> 00:28:55.400
HEALTH PROGRAM EACH COUNTY BASED

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:58.002
IN THIS LOCALITY BASED IN ITS --

00:28:58.069 --> 00:28:59.737
CHOICES AROUND AT THE PROVIDERS

00:28:59.804 --> 00:29:01.706
THAT THEY CONTRACT WITH --

00:29:01.773 --> 00:29:02.907
THE WAY THAT THEY WANT TO

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:04.175
DELIVER SERVICES HOW THEY

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:06.344
ADMINISTER THE PLAN FOR YOU KNOW

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:08.313
APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES AND ALL

00:29:08.379 --> 00:29:09.147
OF THOSE THINGS ARE AT THE

00:29:09.214 --> 00:29:10.949
COUNTIES DISCRETION SO WE LIKE

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:12.750
TO SAY THAT WE HAVE GIVEN.

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:14.085
THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE

00:29:14.152 --> 00:29:15.553
FUNDING TO THE COUNTIES AND IT'S

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.188
UP TO THEM TO DECIDE ON A LOCAL

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:18.923
BASIS HOW THEY OPERATIONALIZE

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.326
THAT OBVIOUSLY WE MAINTAIN

00:29:21.392 --> 00:29:23.695
OVERSIGHT --

00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:25.196
THE PROGRAM BRADLEY READ BUT

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.264
EACH COUNTY HAS A LOT OF

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:27.932
FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY DELIVER

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:29.367
SERVICES TO BOTH PEDIATRIC AND

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.336
ADULT POPULATIONS --

00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:32.937
WHAT WORKS WELL AND WHAT HAS

00:29:33.004 --> 00:29:34.405
WORKED WELL --

00:29:34.472 --> 00:29:36.274
OR WHAT IS A BENEFIT TO

00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:37.509
CALIFORNIA'S --

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:39.978
DELIVERY SYSTEM IS THE FACT THAT.

00:29:40.044 --> 00:29:43.214
COUNTIES HAVE OVER THE YEARS --

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:44.883
REALLY BUILT UP AN AREA OF

00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:46.985
EXPERTISE AND SERVING --

00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:48.553
SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL SERIOUSLY

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.888
MENTALLY ILL POPULATIONS IN A

00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:52.924
WAY THAT I DON'T KNOW THE OTHER --

00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:54.692
ENTITIES VENDORS ARE PROVIDERS

00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:56.961
CAN STEP IN AND DO IN SUCH A

00:29:57.028 --> 00:29:58.696
CAPABLE WAY --

00:29:58.763 --> 00:30:00.231
THAT POPULATIONS THAT THE COUNTY

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:02.167
SERVE AND WORK WITH --

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:03.334
OFTENTIMES THE COUNTIES ARE

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:04.469
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEIR LOCAL

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:06.571
JAILS ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:08.540
OFFICERS THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM

00:30:08.606 --> 00:30:09.674
JUVENILE JUSTICE.

00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:11.042
THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL

00:30:11.109 --> 00:30:14.078
PROBABLY BE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS --

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:15.446
PARTS OF THOSE COUNTY BASED

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:16.748
SYSTEMS AND I THINK THAT THE

00:30:16.814 --> 00:30:18.116
EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF THE

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:19.651
CLINICAL BACKGROUND AND THE

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:21.119
FAMILIAR WITH OUR POPULATIONS

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.320
THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:23.555
CERTAINLY HAVE.

00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:25.456
A LOT OF STRENGTH IN THAT AREA

00:30:25.523 --> 00:30:26.624
WHICH WE WOULD BOTH ACKNOWLEDGE

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:29.260
AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT.

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:30.228
I THINK THE THINGS THAT HAVE

00:30:30.295 --> 00:30:31.563
BEEN MOST CHALLENGING FOR US AS

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:33.831
A STATE IS AS THE FEDERAL

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:35.333
GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED --

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.669
IT'S OVERSIGHT AND REQUIREMENTS

00:30:37.735 --> 00:30:39.304
AROUND HOW BENEFITS ARE

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.138
DELIVERED --

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:43.274
SO THINK BACK A COUPLE OF YEARS --

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:43.908
TO TWENTY MANAGE CARE RULE WAS

00:30:43.975 --> 00:30:44.576
PASSED.

00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:45.810
THE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:46.945
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS WERE

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.546
HAVING TO MEET THE STANDARDS BY

00:30:48.613 --> 00:30:50.848
WHICH OUR MEDICAL MANAGED CARE

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:52.183
PLANS WERE HAVING TO IN TERMS OF

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.184
NETWORK FILENE'S.

00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:54.719
APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES PRE

00:30:54.786 --> 00:30:56.254
AUTHORIZATION OF SERVICES AND

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:58.156
THERE IS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT

00:30:58.223 --> 00:31:00.225
CHANGE IN THE COMPLIANCE ASPECT

00:31:00.291 --> 00:31:01.226
OF DELIVERING CARE THAT THE

00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:02.560
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS HAD

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:03.761
NOT DONE BEFORE.

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:05.496
THIS COMPLIANCE --

00:31:05.563 --> 00:31:07.632
TENDS TO I THINK THE ONE OF THE

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:10.668
LARGEST AREAS OF CONCERN TO US

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:12.737
AS A DEPARTMENT AND THAT THERE

00:31:12.804 --> 00:31:14.272
ARE A LOT OF VERY SMALL COUNTIES.

00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:16.941
I AM I'M JOINED BY A FAIRLY

00:31:17.008 --> 00:31:18.209
SMALL COUNTY --

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:19.544
BUT THEY'RE VERY SMALL COUNTIES

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:21.613
IN WHICH THE CAPACITY AND THE

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:23.481
STAFFING TO ACTUALLY FILL THOSE

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.116
COMPLIANCE --

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:27.085
RESPONSIBILITIES IS SOMEWHAT

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:28.519
LACKING --

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:31.823
WE HAVE AND WILL BE PREPARING --

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:33.424
LETTERS GOING OUT TO A SUBSET OF

00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:34.325
COUNTIES --

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:36.728
RELATING TO THEIR FAILURE TO THE

00:31:36.794 --> 00:31:42.567
FEDERAL VIOLENCE THAT WERE DUE --

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:44.068
FOR DELIVERY SYSTEMS HAD TO FILE

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:45.336
THOSE NETWORK FILING SO MANAGED

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:47.071
CARE DENTAL --

00:31:47.138 --> 00:31:48.773
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.674
MENTAL HEALTH AND THERE IS A

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:50.708
SUBSET OF COUNTIES ON THE MENTAL

00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:52.510
HEALTH SIDE THAT HAVE NOT COME

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:53.678
INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.079
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND SO I

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:56.614
WOULD POINT TO THAT AS BEING ONE

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:57.882
OF THE AREAS THAT.

00:31:57.949 --> 00:31:59.450
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERN

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:00.385
AROUND -- WE

00:32:00.451 --> 00:32:02.253
THINK THAT YOU KNOW COMPLIANCE

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.988
WITH THE BASIC ISSUES ARE THE

00:32:04.055 --> 00:32:06.024
BASIS ASPECT ASPECTS OF THE

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.458
PROGRAM ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:09.060
ONCE YOU CAN MASTER THE BASICS

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:10.628
THEN WE CAN GO ON TO TALKING

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:11.763
ABOUT --

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:14.165
BIGGER BROADER MORE AND

00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:15.967
INNOVATIVE CHANGES --

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:18.102
I THINK THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:19.737
WE SEE IN FRONT OF US AS A

00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:21.673
DEPARTMENT AND CERTAINLY WANTING

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:22.940
TO WORK WITH --

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:24.542
THE COUNTIES AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:25.877
AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL

00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:27.345
GOVERNMENT EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:29.414
IS THE RENEWAL OF THE WAIVERS WE

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.215
HAVE AN ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:32.350
THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER THIRTY

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:34.152
FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY AND ARE

00:32:34.218 --> 00:32:35.053
NINETEEN FIFTEEN WAIVER EXPIRES

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:37.388
IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY SO

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:38.389
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:39.023
MISSING.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.125
TIME FRAME THERE BUT I THINK

00:32:41.192 --> 00:32:43.728
WHAT WE'RE THINKING OF IS HOW DO

00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:45.797
WE CONTINUE AS A DEPARTMENT AND

00:32:45.863 --> 00:32:47.265
AS A STATE TO PUSH THE

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:49.133
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASPECTS OF THE

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.035
INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS CLOSER TO THE

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:52.437
OVERALL DELIVERY SYSTEM SUCH

00:32:52.503 --> 00:32:54.539
THAT WE'RE NOT EXPECTING PEOPLE.

00:32:54.605 --> 00:32:56.441
WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS

00:32:56.507 --> 00:32:58.810
HAVE TO NAVIGATE DIFFERENT

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:00.978
DELIVERY SYSTEMS --

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:03.448
WE AS A DEPARTMENT ARE --

00:33:03.514 --> 00:33:04.549
TAKING A LOOK AT OUR OWN

00:33:04.615 --> 00:33:06.317
DIVISIONS AND DOING INTEGRATION

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:07.485
WITHIN OUR OWN DIVISIONS WE HAVE

00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:09.220
ANNOUNCED A REORGANIZATION OF

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:11.322
OUR EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH AN S.

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:12.657
U. D. DIVISIONS --

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:13.791
COLLAPSING THEM INTO A

00:33:13.858 --> 00:33:15.560
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIVISION I'M

00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:17.128
SEPARATING OUT THE MEDI CAL FROM

00:33:17.195 --> 00:33:19.063
THE NON MEDICAL ASPECTS BUT WE

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.465
ALSO THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:22.567
BOTH AS AS STATE DEPARTMENT AS

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:24.702
WELL AS PROGRAM MEDICALLY. TO

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:26.270
CONTINUE --

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:27.572
TO HAVE OUR STAFF BE SITTING

00:33:27.638 --> 00:33:29.540
CLOSER TO OTHER DELIVERY SYSTEMS

00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:30.942
AND CREATING THAT BODY OF

00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:32.677
EXPERTISE SUCH THAT THE

00:33:32.744 --> 00:33:34.178
INDIVIDUAL BENEFICIARY.

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:36.681
WHO IS RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES --

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:37.782
DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE SUCH A

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:38.916
COMPLICATING EVEN IF IT'S

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:40.618
COMPLICATED ON THE BACK AND THEY

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:41.686
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:43.621
COMPLICATION ON THE FRONT END.

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.723
SO I I POTS ON THE WAIVERS --

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.258
AS KIND OF ONE OF THE MOST

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:50.128
EXCITING CONSEQUENTIAL --

00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:50.928
THINGS THAT WE ARE LOOKING

00:33:50.995 --> 00:33:52.797
FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN LATER

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.999
THIS YEAR AND THE NEXT YEAR --

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:56.000
FOR FOR CERTAIN AS IT PERTAINS

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:57.301
TO THE WAIVER RENEWALS ON BOTH

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:58.236
SIDES.

00:33:58.302 --> 00:34:00.171
AND THEN LASTLY I THINK WHAT YOU

00:34:00.238 --> 00:34:03.207
WILL I CAN'T WHILE HE KATE

00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:07.345
DIRECTOR LOOK FAR OUT INTO THE

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:07.678
FUTURE -- AS

00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:08.746
YOUR AGENDA WOULD KNOW KIND OF

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:10.982
WHAT'S THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN TO

00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:13.284
FIFTEEN YEARS LOOK LIKE --

00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:14.786
A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:16.354
STRUGGLE TO EITHER IMPLEMENT OR

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:18.423
OPERATIONALIZE TODAY AT A STATE

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:19.924
LEVEL ARE --

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:22.360
HISTORICAL VESTIGES OF A PROGRAM

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:24.562
THAT HAS BEEN BUILT OVER DECADES

00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:26.097
AND SO DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:27.532
IN THE EIGHTIES DECISIONS THAT

00:34:27.598 --> 00:34:28.466
WERE MADE IN THE NINETIES

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:29.600
DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE IN THE

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:30.568
TWO THOUSANDS.

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:32.670
WE STILL HAVE --

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:34.071
TO WORK ACCORDING TO THOSE

00:34:34.138 --> 00:34:35.173
DECISIONS BUT THEN THERE HAS

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.974
BEEN OVERLAY AND CHANGES AND

00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:38.476
DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES.

00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:39.944
AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE LOOK AT

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.712
FROM FIVE TO TEN TO FIFTEEN

00:34:41.779 --> 00:34:42.780
YEARS OUT IS.

00:34:42.847 --> 00:34:44.782
HOW DO WE HAVE --

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:45.883
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS HOW

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.885
DO WE HAVE PROVIDERS HOW DO WE

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:49.654
HAVE MANAGED CARE PLANS WORKING

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.988
IN A BETTER ALIGNMENT WITH EACH

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:52.290
OTHER -- WE

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:54.358
MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO FULLY

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:55.993
INTEGRATE THOSE BECAUSE OF

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:56.994
EITHER FINANCING OR OTHER

00:34:57.061 --> 00:34:59.063
COMPLICATIONS BUT I THINK WHAT

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.898
WE REALLY WANT TO SEE IS A

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:03.067
CONTINUED BOTH --

00:35:03.134 --> 00:35:04.602
INCREASED RELIANCE ON EACH OTHER

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:06.771
AS WELL AS OUR THEIR FINANCIAL

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:08.573
WAYS THAT WE CAN TIE SERVICES

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:10.308
TOGETHER THROUGH THOSE ENTITIES

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:12.677
SUCH THAT THEY ARE INCLINED TO

00:35:12.743 --> 00:35:13.544
WORK TOGETHER AS OPPOSED TO

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:14.445
BEING --

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:16.914
WORKING IN SILOS I THINK THAT WE

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:19.150
IMAGINE A WORLD IN WHICH WE ARE

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:21.652
DOING A LOT MORE --

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:23.454
INNOVATIVE FINANCING AS OPPOSED

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:25.189
ASIDE ON A SEAT.

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:28.826
I'M SORT OF FINISHERS THESE ARE

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:31.395
VERY VERY HEAVY DOCUMENTATION

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:33.197
RELIANT TYPES OF FINANCING

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:34.565
MECHANISMS IN WHICH A COUNTY

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:36.801
PAYS. TWO DOLLARS FOR A SERVICE

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:38.069
THEY SUBMIT A CLAIM TO US WE

00:35:38.135 --> 00:35:39.103
DRIVE DOWN A DOLLAR FROM THE

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.037
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN WE

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:41.138
PAY IT BACK TO THEM.

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:42.840
THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY A WAY

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:44.408
THAT IS THE MOST --

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:47.078

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:04.529
HUMAN SERVICES FOR YOLO COUNTY --

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:05.997

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:07.031
PRIVILEGE TO BE SPEAKING ON

BEHALF OF THE UNDERSERVED

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:10.234
POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA THAT

ARE STRUGGLING WITH SEVERE

00:36:11.435 --> 00:36:13.704
MENTAL ILLNESS AND AND OUR

00:36:13.771 --> 00:36:15.606
YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:16.707
WITH EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE AND

POVERTY AND TOXIC STRESS AND A

00:36:20.278 --> 00:36:21.612
LOT OF TRAUMA.

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:24.181
AND I THINK THAT IT'S TIMELY

00:36:24.248 --> 00:36:24.849
THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:26.217
DISCUSSION TODAY BECAUSE IN

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:27.552
RECENT YEARS IT'S BECOME

00:36:27.618 --> 00:36:29.420
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT MOST OF

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:31.222
THE MAJOR SOCIETAL ISSUES WERE

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:32.490
FACING HAVE.

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:33.824
SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH

00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:37.261
AT THE IT'S HOMELESSNESS OR

CRIMINAL JUSTICE OR CHAO WELFARE

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:43.267
ALL OF ALL OF THOSE ISSUES HAVE

00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:44.201
SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:46.304
HEALTH INTERWOVEN IN THEM AND WE

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:48.039
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO

00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:50.374
PARTNER TAKE IT TO BETTER

00:36:50.441 --> 00:36:51.008
OUTCOMES FOR ALL OF THOSE HUMAN

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:52.944
BEINGS.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.947
AM I THINK IT TOO I IT'S NICE TO

00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:57.014
SIT UP HERE WITH JENNIFER AND TO

00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:58.849
HEAR GO AFTER HER AND TO BE ABLE

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:00.585
TO SAY THAT I AGREE WITH ALMOST

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:01.852
EVERYTHING SHE SAID SO.

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:03.521
THAT THAT'S NICE THAT --

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:04.455
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:05.923
NECESSARILY AGREE ON EVERYTHING

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:09.293
BUT I THINK WE BOTH ARE

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.027
COGNIZANT OF WHAT.

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:11.495
WHAT PROBLEMS WE'RE FACING WHAT

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:12.830
CHALLENGES WE HAVE AS A STATE

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:15.266
AND IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM?

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.767
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:18.135
IMPROVEMENT I THINK WE WERE VERY

00:37:18.202 --> 00:37:19.971
SIMILAR IN THE WAY WE SEE US

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:21.706
MOVING FORWARD.

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:23.307
AM I I THINK IT.

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:24.408
YOU ALLUDED CAM JENNIFER ALLUDED

00:37:24.475 --> 00:37:25.343

MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS BEEN

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:29.246
CREATED OVER YEARS IN RESPONSE.

00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:31.582
TO LEGISLATIVE CHANGES SOME

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:34.218
LAWSUITS AND THEN A MYRIAD OF

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:35.820
FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT SEEM

00:37:35.886 --> 00:37:37.555
TO JUST PILE ON TOP OF ONE

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:40.558
ANOTHER INSTEAD OF KIND OF

00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:43.494
FIGURING OUT A WAY FOR THOSE

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:48.232
THINGS TO WORK SEAMLESSLY.

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:49.634
SO WHAT WHAT WORKS WELL.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.002
AT THE SLIDES ARE JUST AS MUCH

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:53.571

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:54.305
OF YOU -- I

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:55.806
AS YOU ALL KNOW WE HAD THE

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:56.841
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT'S BEEN

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:58.309
AN AMAZING THING FOR OUR

00:37:58.376 --> 00:37:59.677
STATEMENT CALIPH WE HAVE A LOT

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:01.812
MORE CALIFORNIANS THAT.

CALIFORNIANS THEY'RE RECEIVING

00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:07.118
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND WHILE

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:09.153
THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF WORK TO

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.421
DO WITHIN THAT.

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:12.289
IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT OVER WHERE

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:12.890
WE WERE BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.558
CARE ACT --

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.127
WE ALSO IN CALIFORNIA ARE LUCKY

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:17.762
ENOUGH TO HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:38:17.828 --> 00:38:19.296
SERVICES ACT --

AT WHILE IT IS ROLLED OUT

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.301
DIFFERENTLY IN EVERY COUNTY IT

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:25.169
HAS BEEN.

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:27.071
A GREAT WAY FOR COUNTIES TO BE

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.706
ABLE -- TO

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:30.041
BUILD SERVICES THAT AREN'T

00:38:30.107 --> 00:38:32.243
NECESSARILY BILLABLE TO A MEDIC

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:34.879
COW FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM --

00:38:34.945 --> 00:38:37.548
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT HAS --

00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:38.916
GROWN A LOT OF OUR OUT REGION

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:40.551
ENGAGEMENT --

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:41.919
A LOT OF THESE KIND OF WRAP

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:43.521
AROUND SERVICES A LOT OF

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:45.156

UNABLE TO COME THROUGH THE FRONT

00:38:48.893 --> 00:38:50.728
DOOR OF A BUILDING THAT'S CALLED

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:51.295
MENTAL HEALTH SO IT'S REALLY

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:54.932
ALLOWED UNITIES AND PARTNER WITH

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:55.700
OUR COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THOSE

00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:56.967
ISSUES.

00:38:57.034 --> 00:38:58.703
AM I AND I THINK ONE OF THE

00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:00.071
THINGS THAT THAT WE DO REALLY

00:39:00.137 --> 00:39:02.339
WELL AS COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH OR

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:04.408
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS TO PARTNER

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:04.608
WITH.

00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:07.611
OUR OTHER COUNTY PARTNERS TO SEE

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:09.013
THE SAME POPULATION TO THERE'S

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:18.989
WE PARTNER PRETTY WELL WITH THEM

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:21.826
I I HAVE A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:23.627
LAST FEW YEARS --

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:24.562
THAT'S THE STATEWIDE INITIATIVES

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:25.596
THAT HAVE BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:27.364
WE HAD SB EIGHTY TWO A FEW YEARS

00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:29.300
AGO WHICH ALLOWED US TO HAVE A

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:31.469
LOT MORE RESPONSE AVAILABLE AT

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:32.570
THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR CRACK FOR

00:39:32.636 --> 00:39:33.904
PEOPLE IN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS

00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:34.972
WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.007
CRISIS RESIDENTIAL AS AN URGENT

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:38.776

ON A CONTINUUM OF CARE FORM.

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:44.048
WHICH IS SOMETIMES SEEN AS A

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:46.083
FOUR LETTER WORD HAS FORCED OUR

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.685
SYSTEMS TO WORK TOGETHER TO

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:49.153
REALLY IMPROVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.621
OUTCOMES FOR THERE ARE CHILDREN

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:51.489
INVOLVED IN THE CHILD WELFARE

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:53.324
SYSTEM. TO BRING THOSE USE HOME

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.092
FROM CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS

00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:56.861
AND PROVIDE THEM WITH TRAUMA

00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:57.795
INFORMED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.897
SERVICES.

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:00.831
AT THE STEPPING UP MOVEMENT HAS

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:03.134
BEEN ADOPTED BY MANY COUNTIES

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.635
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND IT'S

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:06.103
AIMED AT REDUCING THE NUMBERS OF

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.539
MENTALLY ILL IN CUSTODY --

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:11.108
AND IT'S BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL --

00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:11.976
AND THEN THE DRUG MEDICAL

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:14.011
ORGANIZED EVERY SYSTEM HAS BEEN

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:15.279
GREAT FOR THOSE COUNTIES WHO

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:17.381
HAVE CHOSEN TO OPT IN --

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:19.283
AGAIN IT PROVIDES.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.484
RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA WITH

00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:21.952
BENEFITS THAT THEY HAVE NEVER

00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:24.088
HAD BEFORE THAT ARE --

00:40:24.155 --> 00:40:26.423
NOT ONLY HELP THE RESIDENTS BUT

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.526
HELP THE STATE IN TERMS OF

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:29.126
TRYING DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:30.861
FUNDS.

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:32.096
AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:32.963
ARE NO PLACE LIKE HOME AND SHE

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.865
DID WHICH IS MOVING FORWARD I

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:35.800
THINK THERE WERE SEVERAL

00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:37.067
COUNTIES THAT APPLIED FOR THAT

00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:38.803
FUNDING AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:40.204
HOW HAVING MORE HOUSING

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.939
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:43.974
STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS --

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:45.876
WILL HELP TO AMELIORATE

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:47.845
HOMELESSNESS AND HELP THEM BE

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:49.280
MORE STABLE.

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:49.880
AM.

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:52.316
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:53.684
AND MAYBE THESE HAPPEN AND WE

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:55.052
DON'T SEE THEM AT THE COUNTY

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:55.653
LEVEL BUT TO SEE SOME OF THAT

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:57.621
CROSS DEPEND DEPARTMENTAL WORK

00:40:57.688 --> 00:40:59.356
HAPPEN AT THE STATE LEVEL.

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:01.058
IT OFTEN FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:02.526
STATE DEPARTMENTS.

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:03.994
ARE NOT SPEAKING TO ANOTHER ARE

00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:06.697
NOT.

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:08.299
TOWARD THE SAME AND AND THAT

00:41:08.365 --> 00:41:09.667
WOULD BE A REALLY NICE THING FOR

00:41:09.733 --> 00:41:10.868
US TO SEE AND I THINK

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.169
HOMELESSNESS IS GONNA DEMANDED

00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:13.504
OF US RIGHT WE HAVE.

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:15.172
SO MANY STATE DEPARTMENTS

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:16.907
WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS AND WE

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:18.475
ALL SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:20.611
AND HOPEFULLY HEADED TOWARDS THE

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:23.380
SAME METRICS [inaudible]

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:25.816
SO.

00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:27.218
WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT?

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:29.486
UNFORTUNATELY THE SLIDE --

00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:31.488
I WAS ACTUALLY A LITTLE HARDER

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:32.456
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LIMITED

00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:34.458
THAN -- TO

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:35.893
WHAT I WAS GONNA PUT ON IT --

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.761
THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE STATS

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.763
THAT THAT ARE STAGGERING --

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.966
WHILE AN ESTIMATED 5% OF

00:41:42.032 --> 00:41:43.067
CALIFORNIA STRUGGLE WITH SERIOUS

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:46.370
MENTAL ILLNESS AN ESTIMATED 25%

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:47.004
OF OUR HOMELESS CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:47.705
SMI.

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.306
THAT'S BASED ON SELF REPORT AT

00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:50.541
POINT ON THE AT THE POINT IN

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:53.744
TIME COUNTS THE ACTUAL

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:54.745
PERCENTAGE IS MUCH HIGHER.

00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:55.412
IN CALIFORNIA THE SUICIDE IS THE

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:56.747
LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOU

00:41:56.814 --> 00:41:58.716
JUST TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FOUR

00:41:58.782 --> 00:41:59.350
AND THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:02.486
DEATH FOR YOUTH AGE.

00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:03.487
TEN TO TWENTY FOUR OUR SUICIDE

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:04.722
RATE IN CALIFORNIA IS HIGHER

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:06.090
THAN OUR HOMICIDE RATE BY ALMOST

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.858
DOUBLE SO YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO

00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:09.693
TWICE AS LIKELY. TO HARM

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.895
YOURSELF AND TO BE KILLED BY

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:12.696
SOMEONE ELSE IN OUR STATE.

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:15.432
YET IF WE COMPARE OUR INVESTMENT

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:16.901
IN PREVENTION VERSUS PUBLIC

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:19.303
SAFETY.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.039
THERE'S NOT A COMPARISON --

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:24.508
AND ALSO THAT APPROXIMATELY 21%

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:26.110
OF CALIFORNIAN EIGHT STATEWIDE

00:42:26.176 --> 00:42:27.144
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A SEMI.

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:29.713
AGAIN THIS IS TAKEN AT BOOKING

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.016
BASED ON SELF REPORT AND WE KNOW

00:42:32.082 --> 00:42:32.616
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN

00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:33.183
CUSTODY.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.718
THAT DON'T SELF REPORT THEIR

00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:35.953
DIAGNOSES.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.288
AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:38.355
WE CAN'T FORGET OUR LITTLE

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:39.890
PEOPLE WHICH I FEEL LIKE WE DO

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:42.226
ON OCCASION AT ONE IN THREE USED

00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:43.227
TO ASPECTS OF FOSTER CARE IN

00:42:43.294 --> 00:42:43.827
CALIFORNIA.

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:45.529
EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS WITHIN

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:47.998
TWENTY FOUR MONTHS.

00:42:48.065 --> 00:42:48.565
AND THEIR TRAJECTORY IN OUR

00:42:48.632 --> 00:42:49.400
STATE.

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:50.868
IS SUCH THAT FORMER FOSTER YOUTH

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:51.802
ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.404
REPRESENTED IN OUR ADULT POINT%

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.405
IN TIME COUNT.

00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:58.609
AS WE THAT WE DO EVERY YEAR AND

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:00.311
I THINK.

00:43:00.377 --> 00:43:01.946
ALL OF THE STATISTICS JUST

00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:04.014
INDICATE THAT OUR SYSTEM ISN'T

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:06.517
WORKING AS WELL AS IT SHOULD BE.

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:07.751
I THINK UP A PART OF IT.

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:09.420
THE ISSUE IS THAT OUR SYSTEM

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:11.789
INCENTIVIZE IS THE WRONG THINGS

00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:12.656
AND WE'D LIKE TO GET IT TO A

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:14.391
PLACE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:15.426
STATE.

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:17.161
TO FIND A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE THE

00:43:17.227 --> 00:43:18.562
RIGHT THINGS AND GET TO THE

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:20.197
WORDS THE OUTCOMES --

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:21.632
AND IMPROVE THE TRAJECTORY OF

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:25.569
ALL OF THESE.

00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:27.137
SO WE HAVE SOME CURRENT

00:43:27.204 --> 00:43:29.573
STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.607
AGAIN THIS MAY BE I I'M JUST

00:43:30.674 --> 00:43:32.109
KIND OF SAYING THE SAME THINGS

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:34.078
THAT JENNIFER DID AN EACH COUNTY

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:35.179
MANAGES THEIR OWN BEHAVIORAL

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:37.014
HEALTH BENEFITS SO THAT MEANS

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.716
EACH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:41.719
BENEFIT LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT --

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:42.987
WE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES --

00:43:43.053 --> 00:43:45.155
FOR FISSION SEES OF SCALE AND

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:48.292
AND THE REALLY SMALL COUNTIES

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:50.427
HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME --

00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:51.762
MANAGING THAT --

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:55.265
THE REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:56.533
MANAGING PAPER HEALTH BENEFITS.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.167
WE HAVE A RELATIVELY INEFFICIENT

00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:58.769
FEE FOR SERVICE REIMBURSEMENT

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:00.604
STRUCTURE THERE'S SOME PRETTY

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:03.507
ARDUOUS DOCUMENTATION WE HAVE.

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:08.145
TO BILL BY THE MINUTE AND AT WE

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:10.180
HAVE TO DOCUMENT FUNCTIONAL

00:44:10.247 --> 00:44:12.082
IMPAIRMENT AND IT'S NOT FOCUSED

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:13.751
ON WELL BEING ON RECOVERY IT'S

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:15.719
FOCUSED ON A MEDICAL MODEL

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:18.589
SYSTEM DESPITE THE FACT THAT.

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:19.823
ALL EVIDENCE SHOWS IS THAT THOSE

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:20.958
MORE SOCIAL MODEL PROGRAMS

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:22.826
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE MUCH BETTER

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:26.130
OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE WE SIR.

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:28.565
AM I THINK THE THE CROSS SYSTEM

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:30.567
CARE COORDINATION WE CAN'T TALK

00:44:30.634 --> 00:44:32.069
ABOUT THAT ENOUGH I AM GOING TO

00:44:32.136 --> 00:44:32.770
TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN.

00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:34.605
THE INTEGRATIONSLIDE BUT I

00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:36.173
THINK IT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.442
BIGGEST BENT POTENTIAL BENEFITS

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:40.144
IS WHEN WE ALL WORK TOGETHER --

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.246
ACROSS SYSTEMS TO ADDRESS THESE

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:43.881
KIND OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:44.248
HEALTH THAT --

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:45.416
REALLY --

00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:47.985
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT MENTAL

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:49.653
ILLNESS AND I LITTLE PEOPLE THAT

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.422
ARE INVOLVED IN MULTIPLE SYSTEMS

00:44:51.488 --> 00:44:52.456
THROUGHOUT THE TRAJECTORY OF

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:54.691
THEIR LIFE --

00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:56.093
OUR ERA.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.861
OUR MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS I'M

00:44:57.928 --> 00:44:59.997
SURE YOU'VE ALL HEARD THIS STAT

00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:01.465
AND IT SHOULD OF BEEN ON THE

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:02.132
LAST FLIGHT BUT IT'S ON THIS ONE

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:02.299
IT.

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:04.068
DIE ON AVERAGE TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:05.069
YOUNGER THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:06.537
OF PREVENTABLE CHRONIC

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:08.872
CONDITIONS AND I WE ALL AGREE

00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:11.642
THAT THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE WANT

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:12.276
TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE THAT

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:14.478
ARE STRUGGLING.

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.180
I THINK THE TO FURTHER COMPOUND

00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:19.550
THE THE LIMITED SPENDING BECAUSE

00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:20.684
EVEN THOUGH WHERE THE SEVENTH

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:21.819
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:23.087
WHERE THE FORTY EIGHTH IN TERMS

00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:24.188
OF SPENDING ON OUR MEDICARE

00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:26.790
POPULATION. TO FURTHER COMPOUND

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:28.592
THIS LIMITED SPENDING.

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:29.960
WE SPEND AT LEAST THIRTY CENTS

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:31.462
OF EVERY DOLLAR ON

00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:33.464
ADMINISTRATIVE KIND OF FUNCTIONS --

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:34.598
OVERHEAD.

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:36.366
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT MOST

00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:37.468
COUNTIES HAVE.

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:39.436
TO BUDGET OR FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:40.804
HAVE ABOUT TWENTY CENTS OF EVERY

00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:43.340
DOLLAR DISALLOWED IF THEY AREN'T.

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:45.809
PERFORMING TO THAT RAGS THAT THE

00:45:45.876 --> 00:45:47.211
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LAYS DOWN.

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:48.812
SO THAT MEANS THAT OFTENTIMES

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:50.981
COUNTIES ARE HAVE FIFTY CENTS OF

00:45:51.048 --> 00:45:51.548
EVERY DOLLAR TO GIVE TO THE

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:53.750
PEOPLE THEY SERVE.

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:55.752
IN IN YOLO WEEK WHO WE ARE

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:57.254
RELATIVELY SMALL WE USED TO

00:45:57.321 --> 00:45:59.022
BUDGET FOR A MILLION DOLLARS A

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:00.824
YEAR FOR AUDIT EXCEPTIONS AND

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:02.826
THEN WE HAD A 30% OF OUR CLAIMS

00:46:02.893 --> 00:46:03.894
DISALLOWED.

00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:06.163
SO WE FIXED IT BUT IT CAME AT A

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.397
COST BECAUSE WE HAD TO HIRE

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:09.166
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF.

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:12.002
RATHER THAN CLINICAL STAFF AND

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:13.904
IT'S NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT USE

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:17.341
OF RESOURCES.

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:19.710
SO SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS

00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:21.979
TO THE STATE RIGHT BENEFITS --

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.380
I I DO MY BEST IN THIS

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:24.648
PRESENTATION TO KIND OF TALK

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:26.216
ABOUT SHORT MID TERM KIND OF

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:27.484
THINGS WE CAN DO AND THEN MAYBE

00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:29.052
LONGER TERM.

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.787
I THINK PURSUING I AM D.

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:31.955
EXCLUSION.

00:46:32.022 --> 00:46:33.090
MAKES REALLY GOOD SENSE I THINK

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:34.658
MOST OF US AGREE THAT IT DOES I

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:36.793
THINK WE CAN PROBABLY GET THERE

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.162
AND IT BRINGS DOWN ADDITIONAL

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:40.497
FEDERAL FUNDS WHICH IS ALWAYS

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:41.765
HELPFUL.

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:43.033
I'M REINFORCING UPSTREAM

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:44.468
INVESTMENT I DON'T THINK ANY OF

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:45.736
US HAVE A CHOICE I THINK IT'S

00:46:45.802 --> 00:46:47.704
WHAT WE ALL HAVE TO DO I THINK

00:46:47.771 --> 00:46:49.973
WITH OUR NEW ADMINISTRATION WERE

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.409
ABSOLUTELY HEADING THIS WAY --

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:54.178
THE FOCUS IN THE MOST RECENT

00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:56.780
BUDGET ON UNIVERSAL SCREENING

00:46:56.847 --> 00:46:58.649
FOR TRAUMA AND THEY SHIFT

00:46:58.715 --> 00:47:01.051
TOWARDS A MORE UPSTREAM MAKES

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:02.286
REALLY GREAT SENSE AND IT'S

00:47:02.352 --> 00:47:03.387
EXCITING.

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:05.122
IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE LONG

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:05.722
TERM OUTCOMES OF THE PEOPLE WE

00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:07.624
SERVE.

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:09.026
AND THEN MOVING TO THIS PAY FOR

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:11.328
PERFORMANCE MODEL OR AWAY FROM

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:12.796
FEE FOR SERVICE KIND OF MODEL I

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:14.231
THINK.

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:16.500
WHATEVER IT LOOKS LIKE THE WAY

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:17.434
WE'RE DOING IT NOW ISN'T REALLY

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:19.336
WORKING FOR IT FOR THE PEOPLE WE

00:47:19.403 --> 00:47:20.304
SERVE IT'S NOT WORKING FOR THE

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.505
COUNTIES I WOULD ARGUE IT'S

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:22.639
PROBABLY NOT WORKING VERY WELL

00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:24.074
FOR THE STATE.

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:24.675
AND SO WE'D LIKE TO GET TO A

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:25.976
PLACE WHERE WE'RE PAYING FOR

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:27.644
OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:31.448
OUTCOMES AND INCENTIVIZING THOSE

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:32.082
POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:36.653
WE SERVE [inaudible]

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.422
SO INTEGRATION.

00:47:38.488 --> 00:47:40.591
AGAIN THIS IS ONE THAT I THINK

00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:42.426
WE HAVE SOME SHORTER TERM THINGS

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:44.628
WE CAN DO AND AND LONGER TERM I

00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:46.063
THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT.

00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:47.631
INTEGRATING CARE FOR MENTAL

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:48.765
HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE AND

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:50.200
PHYSICAL HEALTH MAKES REALLY

00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:52.035
GOOD SENSE I DON'T THINK MOST OF

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:52.769
US WOULD HAVE DESIGNED THE

00:47:52.836 --> 00:47:54.972
SYSTEM THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:57.107
THAT.

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:58.976
BIFURCATED AT LEAST AND TRY FOR

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:00.577
KATE IT WHICH I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:48:00.644 --> 00:48:02.679
ACTUALLY A WORD AT BEST --

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:06.883
WE AT AND IT'S A LONG ROAD TO

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:08.085
GET TO FULL INTEGRATION I THINK

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:10.354
IT'S A PRETTY HEAVY LIFT AND SO.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.390
I THINK THAT STARTING WITH --

00:48:13.457 --> 00:48:14.725
STRENGTHENING THE INTEGRATION

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:15.692
BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:17.060
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:18.528
MAKES REALLY GOOD SENSE I THINK

00:48:18.595 --> 00:48:20.464
THERE SOME EASY THINGS WE CAN DO

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.266
IN THE SHORT TERM TO REALLY.

00:48:22.332 --> 00:48:24.201
GROW THAT INTEGRATION --

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:26.536
AYE I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME

00:48:26.603 --> 00:48:28.572
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO --

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:31.375
TO GROW THE INTEGRATION WITH.

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:32.209
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE AN

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:34.011
INVESTMENT IN TRAINING PRIMARY

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:35.812
CARE PROVIDERS TO INCREASE THEIR

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:37.581
SCOPE AND COMFORT IN TREATING

00:48:37.648 --> 00:48:38.115
PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:39.850
ILLNESS.

00:48:39.916 --> 00:48:40.784
I DON'T MEAN NECESSARILY

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:42.185
TREATING THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS I

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:45.489
MEAN JUST HAVING TIME IN A VISIT.

00:48:45.555 --> 00:48:47.024
TO TREAT SOMEBODY'S PHYSICAL

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:48.258
HEALTH CONDITION TO STRUGGLING

00:48:48.325 --> 00:48:49.293
WITH SM I..

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.661
AND ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE THEM

00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:52.262
AND ALLOW THEM SOME EXTRA TYPE

00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:54.531
OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:55.832
VISITS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO

00:48:55.899 --> 00:48:58.268
TAKE LONGER THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES

00:48:58.335 --> 00:48:59.970
IN EVERY SINGLE CASE --

00:49:00.037 --> 00:49:01.772
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE

00:49:01.838 --> 00:49:03.707
COULD SUPPORT ALIGNMENT OF

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.375
HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:07.978
OUTCOMES TOGETHER --

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:10.213
AND FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.083
INCENTIVIZE THAT ARE OR OR GROW

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.584
THAT THEM.

00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:15.185
BREAK DOWN THE SILOS I GUESS

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:16.486
BETWEEN THE FUNDING BETWEEN

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:17.321
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:18.955
HEALTH.

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:21.792
AM I THINK WE CAN ALL GET TO

00:49:21.858 --> 00:49:22.993
THIS PLACE OF INTEGRATION IF WE

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.195
WORK TOGETHER ACROSS SYSTEMS I

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:27.230
HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT

00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:28.632
EVERYONE DOING THIS WORK IS

00:49:28.699 --> 00:49:30.600
COMMITTED TO DOING BETTER BY THE

00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:31.635
PEOPLE WE SERVE INTO --

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:33.670
IMPROVING THOSE OUTCOMES FOR THE

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:34.871
PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY DYING

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:37.307
OF CHRONIC CAM PREVENTABLE

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:41.311
CONDITIONS.

00:49:41.378 --> 00:49:43.880
SO THIS IS OUR VISION FOR

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:45.482
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TRANSFORMATION.

00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:49.319
I'LL TALK AGAIN ABOUT --

00:49:49.386 --> 00:49:51.855
A SHORTER TERM AND LONGER TERM.

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:53.657
GOALS AND I'M GONNA CHANNEL A

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:55.525
LITTLE BIT OUR NEW SURGEON

00:49:55.592 --> 00:49:56.893
GENERAL FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.128
SPECIFICALLY THE EPILOGUE FROM

00:49:58.195 --> 00:49:59.696
HER NEW BOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T READ

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:01.965
IT I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT --

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:04.134
I I WANT US TO ALL BE BOLD IN

00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:05.769
OUR VISION OF THE FUTURE WHERE

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.571
EVERY MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES WHO

00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:08.939
NEEDS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:10.440
GETS THOSE SERVICES.

00:50:10.507 --> 00:50:12.776
WHEN THEY WANT THEM IN THE PLACE

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:13.944
THAT'S COMFORTABLE FOR THEM?

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.445
AM IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT IF

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:16.747
WE COULD GET TO A MODERNIZE KIND

00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:18.749
OF VERSION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY

00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:20.517
THAT REALLY LOOKS AT THOSE --

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:24.788
TOXIC STRESS AND AND TROM IN A

00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:26.857
CARE EARLIER IN THEIR LIFE.

00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:27.557
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE SUCH

00:50:27.624 --> 00:50:29.993
HORRIBLE AND OUTCOMES ON THE

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.928
BACK END OF THEIR LIFE SPAN --

00:50:31.995 --> 00:50:34.297
FOCUSING ON QUALITY OF CARE AND

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.465
OUTCOMES --

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:37.567
I'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT THAT'S

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:38.802
ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:41.171
SIMPLIFYING HOWEVER WE CAN

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:43.140
BILLING INCLUDE CLAIMING.

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:46.376
FIGURING OUT HOW TO REDUCE THAT

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:49.146
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN.

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:50.414
FINDING A WAY TO GROW OUR WORK

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.084
FORCE THIS I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH.

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:54.851
I'LL SAY IT TWICE HAVE FINING

00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:56.453
WAY TO GROW OUR WORK FORCE.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.788
AND IN MAYBE THE SOME OF THE

00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:59.456
NONTRADITIONAL WAYS --

00:50:59.523 --> 00:51:00.657
I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.392
HERE WORK FORCE IN BRINGING IN

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:03.727
PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE TO

00:51:03.794 --> 00:51:04.594
HELP THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:06.329
STRUGGLING WE REALLY FIND THAT'S

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.397
ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:09.332
STRATEGIES WE CAN EMPLOY --

00:51:09.399 --> 00:51:12.235
AS WE'RE DOING THIS COMMUNITY

00:51:12.302 --> 00:51:13.203
BASED SERVICES.

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.204
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:15.238
FIND A WAY TO TELL OUR STATE

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:18.642
WIDE STORY IF WE COULD --

00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:21.778
FIND A WAY TO NOT HAVE FIFTY SIX

00:51:21.845 --> 00:51:23.046
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OR A CUSTOM

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:24.514
COMMON METRICS THAT ARE FOCUSED

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:25.882
ON QUALITY THAT WE COULD REPORT

00:51:25.949 --> 00:51:27.317
OUT AND SHARE.

00:51:27.384 --> 00:51:28.718
AND GET FEEDBACK ON GET

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:30.353
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT WE

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.222
COULD MOVE TOWARDS A BETTER

00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:34.057
SYSTEM FOR ALL.

00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:35.959
AM HAVING REGIONAL --

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:38.128
MODELS MIGHT BE AN INTROSPECTIVE

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:39.329
MIGHT BE THE FOREVER STEP

00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:40.497
BECAUSE WE'RE SUCH A LARGE STATE

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:42.265
BUT HAVING SOME REGIONAL MODELS

00:51:42.332 --> 00:51:44.034
MIGHT HELP US GET THERE SOONER

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.303
RATHER THAN.

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:47.938
HAVING A STATEWIDE SYSTEM.

00:51:48.004 --> 00:51:50.507
AND IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE A

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:52.742
SET OF RULES OR GUIDELINES FOR

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:54.044
THE BREADTH OF THE ENTITLEMENT

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.345
PROGRAMS --

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:57.380
I THINK ABOUT STANDING ORDERS

00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:59.483
THAT DOCTORS OFTEN GIVE US IF

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:01.451
THIS THAN THIS AND SO IT WOULD

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:03.186
BE REALLY GREAT FOR THE THOSE OF

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:04.988
US MANAGING THE CARE TO HAVE A

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:06.323
CLEAR OUTLINE OF WHAT IS

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:07.491
EXPECTED.

00:52:07.557 --> 00:52:11.261
AS PROVIDERS OF SERVICE FOR THE

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:11.828
PEOPLE THAT WERE INTENDED TO

00:52:11.895 --> 00:52:15.565
SERVE.

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:17.868
HALF OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:20.437
THE DIVIDENDS WILL BE PAID --

00:52:20.504 --> 00:52:22.339
WELL INTO THE FUTURE I THINK WE

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:25.542
HAVE SOME HEAVY LIFTING TO DO I

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:27.177
I THINK WE HAVE NEVER BEFORE

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:28.578
SEEN SO MANY PARTNERS.

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:30.080
COMING TO THE TABLE SAYING

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:31.615
THEY'RE WILLING TO HELP US GET

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:33.617
TO THE SOLUTION AND SO I'M

00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:37.053
ENERGIZED BY BY THE MULTIPLE

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.622
HEARINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THIS

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:39.623
MONTH AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:41.958
ALL OF THE LEGISLATIVE IDEAS

00:52:42.025 --> 00:52:44.261
THAT I SEE AROUND THIS TOPIC --

00:52:44.327 --> 00:52:47.030
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A FUTURE

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:47.464
WHERE WE'RE REDUCING

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:48.265
HOMELESSNESS.

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:49.633
JUVENILE JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT

00:52:49.699 --> 00:52:51.334
CHAO WILL FOR INVOLVEMENT AND

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:53.036
IMPROVING THE HEALTH OUTCOMES

00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:54.538
FOR THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING WITH

00:52:54.604 --> 00:52:56.439
MENTAL ILLNESS --

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:58.642
I THINK WE CAN GET THERE IF WE

00:52:58.708 --> 00:53:00.477
ALL WORK TOGETHER THANK YOU.

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:02.112
THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

00:53:02.178 --> 00:53:08.618
OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE PAN.

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:09.686
I THANK THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH --

00:53:09.753 --> 00:53:11.221
APPRECIATE THANK YOU BOTH FOR

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:13.023
YOUR PRESENTATIONS --

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:15.425
DIRECTOR TENT AND ALSO DOCTOR

00:53:15.492 --> 00:53:17.394
LARSON. TO REPRESENT PART OF

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.228
YELLOW COUNTY APPRECIATE THE

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:20.397
WORK THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT DOES --

00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:21.865
I GUESS.

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:22.766
LAST LAST HEARING --

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:24.034
I BROUGHT THE ISSUE ABOUT STATE

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:25.602
OVERSIGHT.

00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:30.006
AND I GUESS --

00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:31.441
AND ACTUALLY HEARING --

00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:33.043
DOCTOR LARSON'S TESTIMONY AND

00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:34.411
TALK ABOUT WHAT'S OUR STATE WIDE

00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:35.245
STORY IN SOME SENSES THAT SAM

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:36.546
BUT FRUSTRATED I DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:38.181
STATEWIDE STORY IS BECAUSE IT'S

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:39.149
COUNTY BY COUNTY BY COUNTY NOT

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:39.816
THAT.

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:41.051
DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE DOING

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:43.320
SOME REALLY WONDERFUL STUFF.

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.387
RIGHT -- BUT

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:45.755
YEAH LAST HEARING WHAT WE HEARD

00:53:45.822 --> 00:53:47.557
WAS IS THAT OUT AT LEAST ON THE

00:53:47.624 --> 00:53:49.092
MEDI CAL SIDE --

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:50.160
BECAUSE IN NINETY ONE

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:52.128
REALIGNMENT ESSENTIALLY --

00:53:52.195 --> 00:53:53.730
YOU KNOW COUNTIES HAD RESOURCES

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:55.932
JUST BASED ON HOW THAT CASCADE

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:57.801
OF TAX REVENUE FALLS DOWN SO I

00:53:57.867 --> 00:54:00.103
GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS IS

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.671
THAT -- FOR

00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:03.039
FOR DHS IS IS THAT --

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:04.441
IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT OVER THE

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:06.643
PROGRAM IS THERE SOME ASSESSMENT

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:11.948
AS TO WHAT THE THE NEED OUR

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:13.917
DEMAND ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:16.119
THAT WITH THE REASON ACTUALLY

00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:19.556
HAS A VERY THE MEDI CAL SITE.

00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:24.461
WE HAVE A BECAUSE WE WERE FOR

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:26.763
NEEDS BASED ON THIS CASCADE OF

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.164
REVENUE THAT FALLS AND WHATEVER.

00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:29.666
FINALLY IT LANDS IN THE MIDDLE

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.334
HEALTH POD IS WHAT THEY GOT TO

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:32.702
WORK WITH WHAT THE MATCH.

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:33.870
ON THE FEDERAL SIDE BUT THERE

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:35.839
MAY BE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THAT

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.007
AND THE THE AND THE NEED IN AND

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:39.075
THE COUNTY BUT ARE WE DOING SOME

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:40.410
ASSESSMENT SO WE KNOW WHERE THIS

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:42.612
WHERE THAT'S HAPPENING AND HOW

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:44.948
HOW SEVERE IT IS --

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:47.784
I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S IT'S

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:51.021
PROBABLY NOT THAT EASY SO THERE

00:54:51.087 --> 00:54:51.988
IS A IS EASY YEAH THERE'S A

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:53.923
REALIGNMENT FUNDING SOURCES --

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:55.125
THE NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT AS

00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:57.127
YOU NOTED IN THE TWO THOUSAND

00:54:57.193 --> 00:54:58.528
ELEVEN REALIGNMENT --

00:54:58.595 --> 00:54:59.796
COUNTIES ARE ABLE TO USE BOTH

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:01.464
THOSE FUNDS SOURCES AS WELL AS

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:03.366
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:05.835
AS WELL AS CAN GENERAL FUNDS IF

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:07.737
THEY CHOOSE TO THERE'S SOME

00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:08.505
LIMITED.

00:55:08.571 --> 00:55:11.241
AND HEALTH BLOCK GRANT FUNDS --

00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:11.841
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE FEDERAL

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:15.011
FUNDS THE WAY THAT REALIGNMENT

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:16.880
WAS DONE ON WINDOWS NINETY ONE

00:55:16.946 --> 00:55:19.082
IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IS THE

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:21.151
COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

00:55:21.217 --> 00:55:21.718
ENTITLEMENT.

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:23.353
I MEAN THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.021
PROVIDING WHATEVER'S NECESSARY

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:26.289
FOR THE INDIVIDUALS MEETING THAT

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:27.657
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND MEETING

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:29.859
MEDICAL NECESSITY THE FUNDS

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:35.031
SOURCES NOT NECESSARILY --

00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:37.133
TO B. YOU KNOW I TRACKING WITH

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.702
THE PERSON'S INDIVIDUAL MEDICAL

00:55:38.768 --> 00:55:40.637
NEEDED IS A YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY A

00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:42.305
VERY COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP

00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:43.440
BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:44.307
COUNTIES IN TERMS OF HOW

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:45.875
REALIGNMENT FUNDS HAVE BEEN

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:47.844
DIVVIED UP THEIR TAX.

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:49.579
SOURCES THAT YOU KNOW BASED ON

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:50.447
HOW THE STATE IS DOING

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:52.515
ECONOMICALLY THAN FUND SOURCES

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:53.817
FLOW DOWN AND VARIOUS --

00:55:53.883 --> 00:55:56.453
STREAMS BUT I THINK THAT --

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.254
WE WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE

00:55:58.321 --> 00:55:59.355
COUNTIES --

00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:00.857
ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR THOSE

00:56:00.924 --> 00:56:02.659
FUNDS OBVIOUSLY AS IT RELATES TO

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:04.461
THE C. PEAS AND THE DRAWDOWN OF

00:56:04.527 --> 00:56:06.763
THE FEDERAL DOLLARS --

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:07.864
THERE IS.

00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:09.632
SOME PROVISIONS IN THIS IN THE

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:10.967
STATUTE --

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:14.204
AROUND COUNTY FUNDING FOR STE --

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:16.506
SERVICES SUCH AS LIKE I AM DIS --

00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:17.407
IN WHICH COUNTIES ARE

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:19.175
RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR

00:56:19.242 --> 00:56:21.244
INSTITUTES FOR MENTAL DISEASE --

00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:22.779
STAYS THERE IS NO F. P.

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.714
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT COUNTIES

00:56:24.781 --> 00:56:26.316
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR

00:56:26.382 --> 00:56:28.118
THOSE SERVICES --

00:56:28.184 --> 00:56:29.219
WE HAVE REMINDED THE COUNTIES

00:56:29.285 --> 00:56:30.653
THROUGH RECENT AYE ENDS THAT

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.021
THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:32.989
THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THE

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:34.290
STATUTE THAT IF IT COUNTY SAYS I

00:56:34.357 --> 00:56:37.127
DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING TO

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:38.294
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE

00:56:38.361 --> 00:56:39.462
FOR SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN

00:56:39.529 --> 00:56:40.530
MY COUNTY.

00:56:40.597 --> 00:56:42.265
THEY CAN COME TO THE STATE THEY

00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:45.335
HAPPEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:46.703
SOURCES AND THEN A CONVERSATION

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.905
WITH INTO AND TO MY HISTORICAL

00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:51.341
KNOWLEDGE NO COUNTY HAS EVER.

00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:51.941
HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE

00:56:52.008 --> 00:56:53.710
STATE.

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:55.578
OKAY FIRST I GUESS --

00:56:55.645 --> 00:56:57.113
WELL I KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED AND

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.915
I THINK HAVING SOME ASSESSMENT

00:56:58.982 --> 00:57:01.985
AS TO HOW WERE YOU KNOW.

00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:03.553
BECAUSE WE HAVE AGAIN FIFTY

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.155
EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES AS YOU

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:05.889
AS YOU MENTIONED.

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:08.057
KNOWING WHERE WE ARE WITH

00:57:08.124 --> 00:57:09.726
RELATIVES EACH COUNTY AND THE

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:11.227
RESOURCES THEY HAVE AVAILABLE I

00:57:11.294 --> 00:57:13.229
THINK IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE

00:57:13.296 --> 00:57:14.931
YOUR ACCESS TO MIDDLE HOW SHOULD

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:17.433
DEPEND ON WHICH GEOGRAPHY.

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:18.802
I MEAN I AND AND SO --

00:57:18.868 --> 00:57:19.636
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

00:57:19.702 --> 00:57:23.573
NEED TO TO TO LOOK AT THINK

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:23.807
ABOUT --

00:57:23.873 --> 00:57:26.843
YEAH I LAST YEAR ACTUALLY THE

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:29.145
LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE I TO

00:57:29.212 --> 00:57:29.579
CHEER TO HEARING --

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:30.513
WILL LOOK AT THE STEINBERG US TO

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.614
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT INNOVATIONS

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:33.149
IN MENTAL HEALTH AND WE ARE SHE

00:57:33.216 --> 00:57:33.783
HEARD FROM THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:36.186
AND AND THE STATE OF NEW YORK AT

00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:39.989
AND I COULD DO IS GO WHILE.

00:57:40.056 --> 00:57:43.827
INSIDE BASICALLY WE DON'T HAVE

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:45.962
MUCH OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT HAPPENS

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:48.097
AND IN IN IN EACH COUNTY SO WELL

00:57:48.164 --> 00:57:49.599
I SAID MANY COUNTIES ARE DOING

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.201
REALLY WONDERFUL THINGS.

00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:52.569
WE DO WE HAVE MINIMUM STANDARDS

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:54.704
WE TO ACTUALLY APPRECIATE --

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:56.172
THE DOCTOR LISTEN YOU TALKED

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:56.806
ABOUT -- YOU

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:57.974
KNOW COMMON METRICS IN FACT LAST

00:57:58.041 --> 00:57:59.642
YEAR I HAD A BILL --

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:00.710
THAT SAID THAT MAYBE WHAT WE

00:58:00.777 --> 00:58:01.644
SHOULD DO THE OF A PROCESS TO

00:58:01.711 --> 00:58:03.046
ESTABLISH STATE MENTAL HEALTH

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:03.847
GOALS.

00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:05.014
AND METRICS IT'S THERE'S

00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:06.082
ACTUALLY NO MANDATE TO THE

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:07.083
COUNTY IS TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:08.051
ANYTHING FOR THE STATE MENTAL

00:58:08.117 --> 00:58:09.652
HEALTH GOALS BUT LEAST WE WOULD

00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:11.020
COLLECT STATEWIDE.

00:58:11.087 --> 00:58:13.857
A SET OF METRICS ON ON ON THESE

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:15.925
A FEW ITEMS IN WHICH WE SAY WHAT

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:17.060
WE WANT TRIED TO BEND THE CURVE

00:58:17.126 --> 00:58:18.394
ACROSS THE STATE AND STILL UP TO

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:19.729
THE COUNTY HOW MUCH THEY WANT TO

00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:21.598
PUT INTO DOING THAT ARE NOT IN

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:24.267
EITHER A DOING IT SO THEY'LL

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:24.467
NEED.

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:26.102
ANYMORE MONEY.

00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:27.503
BUT DOWN AT LEAST ALLOWS US TO

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:28.404
TELL STATEWIDE STORY AND DEBT

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:31.040
FOR EXAMPLE --

00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:31.808
YOU KNOW --

00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:33.243
THE OPIOID CRISIS RIGHT NOW I

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.643
KNOW SOMETHING --

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:34.811
DOCKED WITH THIS --

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:35.712
STRUGGLING WITH IN HIS DISTRICT

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:36.346
AT SOMETHING I THINK MANY OF US

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:38.848
ARE STRUGGLING WITH.

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:40.750
AS WELL.

00:58:40.817 --> 00:58:41.618
I I CAN'T SAY AND WE HAVE A

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:42.252
HEARING ABOUT THAT SO WE'LL BE

00:58:42.318 --> 00:58:43.219
TALKING A LITTLE BIT LATER --

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:46.256
BUT I'M NOT SURE I CAN SAY WELL

00:58:46.322 --> 00:58:48.591
DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE.

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:49.525
IF DIFFERENT COUNTY STORIES BUT

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:51.294
WE HAD TO WE HAD HOW COME WE

00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:52.262
DESCRIBE OR STATEWIDE EFFORT IN

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:53.730
TRYING TO TACKLE THAT IN TERMS

00:58:53.796 --> 00:58:55.965
ACCESS TO TREATMENT RIGHT --

00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:57.767
SO -- SO

00:58:57.834 --> 00:59:00.803
WHAT ARE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT --

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:01.404
IS IT THE BILL OF FORTUNATELY

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:04.474
DID NOT PAY OKAY ACT WE CAN HAVE

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.910
A PROCESS EVERY FIVE TO TEN

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:07.543
YEARS WE STEP WISH.

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:09.312
STATEWIDE MENTAL HEALTH GOALS

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:10.980
SET A SET OF FIVE METRICS THAT

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:11.981
PEOPLE THAT EVERY COUNTY HAS

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:13.416
REPORT ON TO AT LEAST AND THEN

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:14.384
THAT WAY WE WOULD HAVE THE ABLE

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:16.052
TO TELL THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:16.819
OVERALL.

00:59:16.886 --> 00:59:18.221
WE MADE PROGRESS WE DID MAKE

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:19.656
PROGRESS ON THESE PARTICULAR

00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:20.890
GOALS AND PEOPLE NEED COUNTY CAN

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:22.091
SAY ARE WE DOING ENOUGH IN OUR

00:59:22.158 --> 00:59:23.226
COUNTY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:26.095
ISSUES AND THIS IS A PRIORITY IN

00:59:26.162 --> 00:59:26.696
OUR COUNTY SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:27.630
THAT.

00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:29.699
SURE SO I THINK --

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:32.268
A COUPLE OF THINGS IT'S NOT ED.

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:35.271
I THINK WE HAVE SET OUT --

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:36.806
THE MEASURES THAT WE HAVE ON THE

00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:38.775
MENTAL HEALTH SIDE WE CERTAINLY

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:39.676
ARE --

00:59:39.742 --> 00:59:41.110
GETTING DATA FROM THE COUNTY

00:59:41.177 --> 00:59:42.378
MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AS IT

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:44.113
RELATES --

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.982
TO THERE'S AN EQ RO SO EXTERNAL

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:47.817
QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION THAT

00:59:47.884 --> 00:59:49.719
HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR GOING

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:51.321
INTO THE COUNTIES THERE ARE A

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.156
CONTRACTOR TO US BUT THEY GO OUT

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:54.223
TO EACH OF THE COUNTIES.

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:55.625
THEY'RE PULLING QUALITY DATA SO

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:57.660
THEY'RE GOING INTO FILES AND

00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:59.228
BENEFICIARIES AND A MEASURING

00:59:59.295 --> 01:00:00.029
FOR CERTAIN OUTCOMES WE HAVE

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:01.731
SOME -- DATA

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:03.599
THAT WE TAKE TODAY BOTH ON A

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:04.901
STATEWIDE BASIS AS WELL AS ON A

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:06.736
COUNTY BASIS --

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.471
JUST LOOK AT METRICS I THINK

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:09.839
THERE'S A LOT OF METRICS THAT

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.007
HAVE NOT YET BEEN DEVELOPED AT A

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:14.310
NATIONAL LEVEL AS IT PERTAINS --

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:14.744
TO MENTAL HEALTH --

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:17.146
I THINK PART --

01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:18.848
IT'S MUCH MORE OF A QUALITATIVE

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.683
AND QUANTITATIVE TYPE OF MEASURE

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:21.384
AND IT REQUIRES --

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:22.986
CHART POLLS WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:24.554
A LOT MORE DIFFICULT THAN USING

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.955
ADMINISTRATIVE DATA WHICH WE GET

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:27.857
AT THE STATE OBVIOUSLY FAIRLY

01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:28.624
WELL.

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:29.192
I THINK --

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:32.195
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUTCOMES --

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:32.929
TWO OF THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:35.732
RECENTLY AGREED TO USE --

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:37.066
AS IT PERTAINS TO THE USE

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:40.203
POPULATION SO WE HAVE BOTH THE

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:44.140
PSC WHICH IS THE PEDIATRIC

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:46.109
SENTENCES CHECKLISTS AT FIRST

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:49.912
AND CANS WHICH IS THE CHILD

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:51.147
ADOLESCENT BEASTS AND STRENGTH

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:52.215
THERE WE GO CHILD.

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:54.350
SO I KNOW THE ACRONYMS BUT NOT

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:54.751
WITH THE STAND --

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:56.119
FOR WE AS A DEPARTMENT SHOWS

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:57.754
BOTH OF THOSE --

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.455
FOR USE IN THE MEDICAL

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:00.823
POPULATION FOR ALL CHILDREN ARE

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:02.225
GETTING SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:03.159
SERVICES THROUGH THE COUNTIES

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:04.827
THOSE ARE ASSESSMENT TOOLS BUT

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:06.462
THEY ARE ALSO OUT WE ARE GOING

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:07.563
TO BE USING THOSE FOR OUTCOMES

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:08.998
DATA MEASUREMENTS --

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:11.467
THE COUNTIES I ARE RESPONSIBLE

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:12.602
FOR REPORTING THAT DATA TO US IN

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:14.504
AN AGGREGATED WAY SO I WOULD SAY

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.906
THAT I'M A LOT OF THE INTERNAL

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:18.374
INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.109
ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANICS.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:23.079
OF DOING BETTER DATA IS UNDER

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:26.849
WAY AND IS IT FULLY --

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.217
DEMONSTRATING OUT COMES AT A

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:30.787
BROAD LEVEL NO I THINK THAT DATA --

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.889
AND AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE COMING

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:34.323
FROM A LARGE MEDICAL.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.825
CONGLOMERATE ITSELF IS IT

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:37.794
SOMETIMES A LOT OF WORK TO GET

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.795
THE SYSTEM SET UP AND THEN ONCE

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.263
YOU DO AND YOU START TO SEE THE

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:41.597
DATA YOU DO SOME VALIDATION AND

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:43.099
YOU MAKE SURE THAT --

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.801
YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE PROVIDER

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:45.835
OR THE PLAN IN THIS CASE TO

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:47.070
STATE YOU KNOW THIS IS THE DATA

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:48.438
WE GOT FROM YOU DOES THAT MAKE.

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:50.006
SENSE AND THEY SAY OH IT DOESN'T

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:51.274
LOOK RIGHT TO US LET US GO BACK

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.009
AND TEST THE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:54.310
THAT THE YOU KNOW THE METRICS

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:55.511
ARE SET THE RIGHT WAY.

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:57.280
SO I WOULD SAY --

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:58.548
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE

01:01:58.614 --> 01:01:59.882
DONE OUR VERY MUCH GEARED

01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:01.451
TOWARDS LOOKING AT OUTCOMES I

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:02.919
THINK THAT THE OTHER THINGS THAT

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.387
WE'VE DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL.

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:06.389
ABOUT TELLING OUR STORY FROM A A

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.491
BROADER PERSPECTIVE --

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:09.792
GET DOWN TO THINGS LIKE THE

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:11.527
WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT IN WHICH

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:14.464
WE HAVE BASICALLY PUSHED --

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:16.132
VARIOUS COUNTY ORGANIZATIONS

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.533
TOGETHER AND SAID YOU NEED TO

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.601
YOU NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:20.636
IDENTIFY YOUR POPULATIONS THAT

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:21.804
NEED THE MOST.

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:25.308
CONSISTENT SUPPORTED COORDINATED

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:26.642
THIS POPULATIONS CHOSEN BY THE

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.311
COUNTIES ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:29.679
MENTAL ILLNESS --

01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:32.815
OR HOMELESSNESS OR INCARCERATION --

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:34.750
ISSUES AND SO I THINK THAT A

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:36.752
STATEWIDE LEVEL WE ARE WORKING

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:38.387
TO DEVELOP THOSE DATA SYSTEMS TO

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:40.022
DEVELOP THOSE RELATIONSHIPS --

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.858
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:43.826
BUILD THE BASICS BEFORE YOU CAN

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:45.228
THEN KIND OF GO TO THE NEXT YEAR

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:45.895
IN TERMS OF EITHER

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:47.497
SOPHISTICATION INNOVATION OR

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:48.965
MORE YOU KNOW KIND OF

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.166
COMPLICATED --

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:51.901
ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.603
AND SO YOU KNOW IT IS A WORK IN

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:55.338
PROGRESS AND I THINK THAT --

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:56.539
HAVING THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:58.341
PLANS TREATED IN A SIMILAR WAY

01:02:58.407 --> 01:02:59.542
AS OUR MEDICAL MANAGED CARE

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.010
PLANS IN TERMS OF ENCOUNTER DATA

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:03.246
SAID MISSION NETWORK FILENE'S

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:04.914
ALL THE COMPLIANCE IS YOU'LL

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:07.316
START TO SEE A GROWING --

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:08.885
KIND OF SOPHISTICATION AND HOW

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.887
WE LOOK AT DATA AND THEN HOW THE

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:12.021
COUNTIES ARE REPORTING IT TO US

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:13.356
AND THEN THAT HELPS YOU KNOW

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:15.158
CERTAINLY ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:16.159
YOU HAVE AROUND OUTCOMES.

01:03:16.225 --> 01:03:17.527
OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE THAT

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:19.328
THERE'S PROGRESS BEING MADE THAT

01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:20.696
**** SAY THAT STILL COLLECTING

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:22.832
DATA AND MONITORING WHICH I KNOW

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:24.600
THE DEPARTMENT DOES A LOT OF

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:26.202
THIS ONLY.

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:28.504
A PARTIAL STEP WE MENTION THE TO

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:29.939
LINK THOSE TWO OUTCOMES IS THAT

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:32.308
TELLING OUR STORY RIGHT AND THE

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.543
WATER RESULTS AND ALSO SITTING.

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.344
IDENTIFY WHAT OUR GOALS ARE SO

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:36.212
THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:37.947
MEASURE METRICS THAT MATTER TO

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:40.550
THOSE GOALS SO OTHERWISE WE GET

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:42.351
METRICS BUT WE'RE NOT GERMAN

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:43.152
ACTING ON THEM.

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:44.487
I THINK THAT'S WHAT FINALLY --

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:46.589
I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.257
ABOUT INTEGRATION --

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:49.158
TRYING TO INTEGRATE OUR MENTAL

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:50.626
HEALTH WITH THE MEDIC HOW --

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:51.761
THE FOR BOTH OF YOU --

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:53.329
ACTUALLY JUST LAST WEEK LAST

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:54.430
WEDNESDAY --

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.999
THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE DID

01:03:57.066 --> 01:04:01.704
A HOLE HE I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT --

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.039
WELL NOT EVERYONE ALWAYS AS AS I

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.240
STILL MENTAL HEALTH IS GENERALLY

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:05.741
A CHRONIC CONDITION --

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.510
WHICH FORTUNATELY WE DO NOT HAVE --

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:08.444
FOR MOST DENTAL HEALTH

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.413
CONDITIONS A TREATMENT THAT WITH.

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:11.781
YOUR SOMEONE OF IT THAT

01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:13.115
SOMETHING THEY HAVE.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:13.883
TO THAT WE CAN MANAGE AN

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.151
IMPROVING TREAT IT'S VERY

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.186
TREATABLE FOR MANY PEOPLE BUT

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.955
IT'S IT'S AN ONGOING ISSUE AND

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:21.691
SO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT --

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:22.458
DO YOU GET THAT MUCH BETTER

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:23.626
OUTCOMES --

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.361
WITH INTEGRATION --

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:29.498
AND AND AS YOU NOTE DOES NOTED

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:31.200
IN THE TESTIMONY --

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:32.468
HEALTH IS LINKED TO PHYSICAL

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:33.436
HEALTH THE BRAIN IS NOT SEPARATE

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:34.604
FROM THE REST OF THE BODY I MEAN

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:35.271
I KNOW WE AT THIS WHOLE

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:36.472
ARISTOTLE THING IN THE PAST

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:37.073
ABOUT THAT --

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:38.274
BUT IT YOU KNOW THE BRAINIS IT

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:39.976
AS A PHYSICAL ORGAN AS WELL AS

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:41.811
AND AND SO THE THEY INTERACT AND

01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:43.179
OF COURSE WE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.013
TO TERMS OF HEALTH.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.047
SO -- WE'VE

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:46.983
GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.484
INTEGRATE AND I THINK WHEN WE

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.086
LOOK AT OUR VARIOUS --

01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:51.520
WAIVERS AND SO FORTH AND I KNOW

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.055
OF TRADE THESE DIFFERENT MODELS

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:55.091
AND WE TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY.

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.292
OF AT SOME POINT.

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:58.461
WE ARE HERE TODAY AND WE NEED TO

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:01.998
LOOK TO THE STUDIES HISTORY --

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:03.733
YOU KNOW WE WE NEED RECOGNIZE IT

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:04.667
BUT WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.269
HISTORY TO AND SAY WHAT IS THE

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:07.470
KIND OF MODEL WANT TO MOVE

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:10.306
TOWARD AND NOT SIR STICK TO THE

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.741
WHAT WE ALWAYS DONE IT THIS WAY

01:05:11.807 --> 01:05:12.375
SO WHICH CAN KEEP DOING IT THAT

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:13.609
WAY -- SO WE

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:16.779
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD ON ON THAT --

01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:18.114
AND SO -- NO

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.915
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:21.050
DO -- AND I

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:22.985
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:24.954
BUT I I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:26.389
THINGS MOVING A BIT QUICKER AND

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:27.023
NOW I THINK PEOPLE ARE KIND OF

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:28.491
FRUSTRATED.

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:30.092
WITH -- THE

01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:32.595
WITH WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:38.067
AND THE PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY --

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:39.235
WE KNOW THE NEED IS THERE BUT

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:40.636
YET -- WHAT

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:43.172
YOU KNOW A LOT OF --

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.473
AND COUNTIES WERE EVEN SOME THE

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.041
COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON THE

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.008
MONEY RIGHT.

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:47.476
AND THEY WEREN'T GETTING IT OUT

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:50.680
AND THAT THAT WAS FRUSTRATING --

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:53.182
AND YOU KNOW THAT THE ACTUALLY

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:54.050
WE HAD THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:56.118
ABOUT HOW THE THE PART BECAUSE

01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:57.053
GOOD SERVICES TO GETS AN

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.854
ALLOCATION PROP SIXTY THREE TO

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:00.056
MONITOR HOW THE MONEY'S GOING TO

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:00.923
THE COUNTIES WASN'T TRACKING

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:01.557
THAT.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:02.725
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.760
SPENDING AND SO NO THAT'S PASSED

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:06.329
THAT'S PAST HISTORY NOW BUT WE

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:07.563
WILL BE SURE WE KNOW WE TOLD

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.432
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE FUNDS

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:10.099
THEY'RE OUT THERE BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.034
THE VOTERS PASSED THAT MONEY

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:12.702
EXPECTING THAT THINGS ARE GONNA

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:13.669
BE DONE WITH THAT MONEY THAT.

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:14.837
HAS HAPPENED IN SOME COUNTIES

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:16.305
AND SOME OTHER PLACES IT HASN'T

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:18.240
AND SO --

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:18.841
YOU KNOW WE NEED IT WE DO IN

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.276
ORDER TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC TRUST

MAKING PROGRESS THAT THERE.

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:23.746
THAT THAT THE DOLLARS ARE GIVING

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.848
US ARE BEING USED AND BEING USED

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:26.716
TO GOOD GOOD EFFECT IN THAT WE

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.384
HAVE THAT STORY TO TELL BOTH

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:30.519

BUT WHAT I THINK WE HAVE A WE

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:45.668
NEED TO MOVE THE BEST.

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:52.074
FROM SOME OF THE AREAS WITH

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:53.242
THEIR YOUTH.

THAT ARE THERE AND AREAS IT

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:56.178
NEEDS IMPROVEMENT --

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:58.381
IN IN YOLO COUNTY --

01:06:58.447 --> 01:06:59.215
WE COME FROM --

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:00.816
IN SAN MARINO COUNTY WE WERE

01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:01.917
ABLE.

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:03.719
TO START TO PUT TOGETHER DATA ON

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:05.087
THE HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATION

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:06.322
THAT'S OUT THERE AND A LOT OF

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:08.023
THIS AMIR'S THE INFORMATION

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:10.292
THAT'S HERE NOW. ONE OF THE

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:11.460
THINGS WE ALSO --

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:13.162
START TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IN IN

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:14.630
THE JOSHUA TREE AREA IT WAS A

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:20.002
CRISIS HE STABILIZATION UNITS --

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:22.571
BRICK AND MORTAR --

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:23.606
SO FREE FOR SOME OF THESE

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:25.441
COMPONENTS INTO A

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:27.476
DESTABILIZATION CRISIS AREA

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:30.346
DESTABILIZING THEM ULTIMATELY --

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:32.014
LAW ENFORCEMENT THE EMERGENCY

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:33.482
ROOMS -- THE

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.451
IMPACTS THAT WERE BEING DONE

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:36.919
THERE WE'RE NOW --

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:40.222
MINIMIZE BECAUSE OF THAT SO.

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:42.158
SEEN THAT THERE'S SUCH A AN AREA

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:43.726
WITH OUR OUR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:44.827
ARE OUR YOUTH.

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:47.797
IN AGES YOU KNOW FROM K. THROUGH

01:07:47.863 --> 01:07:49.565
TWELVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:50.900
FOUR TWENTY FIVE THOSE AGES IN

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:52.334
THAT AGE GROUP THAT I THINK WE

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:54.069
NEED TO HAVE A A A BETTER FOCUS

01:07:54.136 --> 01:07:55.571
ON SOME OF THOSE THINGS.

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:56.472
DO YOU THINK THAT THE CRISIS

01:07:56.539 --> 01:07:58.707
STABILIZATION UNITS --

01:07:58.774 --> 01:08:01.477
IF THEY'RE CONSTRUCTED IN AREAS

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:03.345
WOULD SERVE TO THAT ROLE AS FAR

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:07.383
AS LOOKING AT THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:08.984
ISSUE IT AND SELL.

01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:10.319
I WILL SAY THE STATURE

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:13.055
CALIFORNIA SO NOT JUST YOLO

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:14.590
COUNTY SO IN A WHITE THIS IS THE

01:08:14.657 --> 01:08:15.991
ISSUE -- I

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:18.027
THINK CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:19.695
HAVE APLACE IN CERTAIN

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:20.663
COMMUNITIES.

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.898
I I THINK A BETTER INVESTMENT OF

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:24.600
OUR RESOURCES WOULD BE TO GET

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:25.968
BEFORE ANYBODY EVER GETS TO THE

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:26.902
COULD.

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:28.571
POINT TO GET FARTHER UPSTREAM

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:30.606
AND TAKE CARE OF THEM EARLIER

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:32.374
BEFORE THEY END UP IN CRISIS AND

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:34.043
I I I THINK WE HAVE SOME MODELS

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.212
AND SOME --

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:38.781
EXAMPLES OF HOW TO DO THAT THOSE

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.115
CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS

01:08:40.182 --> 01:08:41.951
ALTOGETHER BUT I DO THINK WE

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:43.452
HAVE SOME --

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:45.554
OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE UPSTREAM

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:47.156
INVESTMENT TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:49.024
ARE YOU SOUND ARE ADULTS FROM

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:49.859
GETTING INTO THAT CRISIS

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:50.693
SITUATION.

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.127
SO YOU THINK MOVING.

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:54.296
IN TOGETHER IN UNISON SO SOME OF

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:54.797
THESE --

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:56.265
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:56.932
SEE IT OF A LOT OF THAT

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:58.367
HAPPENING --

01:08:58.434 --> 01:08:59.502
IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOW WITH THEM

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:01.704
THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:02.338
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE GOING

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:02.838
ON IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:04.807
I'M CRISIS STABILIZATION --

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:07.276
AREAS AS WELL AS PREVENTIVE AT A

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:10.813
EARLY AGE AND EARLY --

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:16.252
IN SOMEONE'S EARLY LIFE.

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:20.923
ANY OTHER YES.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.857
THANK YOU CHRIS --

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:23.392
I WOULD ASK ABOUT WHAT YOUR

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:24.793
EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN.

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:26.328
WITH REGARDS TO THE UNDOCUMENTED

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:28.731
COMMUNITY ACCESS TO MENTAL

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:30.099
HEALTH --

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:32.735
WHETHER --

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:33.802
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENCES

01:09:33.869 --> 01:09:35.971
AND AND WHO IS ELIGIBLE MONTHS

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:37.406
THEY UNDOCUMENTED.

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:41.410
BUT AND WHAT CAN BE DONE.

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:42.511
TO IMPROVE.

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:44.747
JUST LIKE OVERALL FOR MEDI CAL

01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:48.050
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE --

01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:49.285
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THE

01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:50.853
UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY SURE

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.221
GREAT QUESTION --

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:53.789
SO -- YOU

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.125
KNOW FIRST AS ALL CHILDREN

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.026
REGARDLESS OF DOCUMENTATION

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:59.428
STATUS UP THROUGH THE AGE OF

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:00.396
EIGHTEEN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FULL

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:02.231
SCOPE MEDICAL BENEFITS I THINK

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:04.033
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY --

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:05.301
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT CERTAINLY

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:07.002
GUARANTEES THOSE CHILDREN HAVE

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:09.071
ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE OF MEDI

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:10.306
CAL ENTITLEMENT SERVICES

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:11.574
INCLUDING SPECIALTY MENTAL

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.608
HEALTH SERVICES.

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:13.976
I'M OBVIOUSLY AS PART OF THE

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:16.912
GOVERNOR'S INCREASING THAT

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:19.214
ELIGIBILITY UP TO THE AGENT

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:21.817
THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.018
FOR INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT --

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.153
SATISFACTORY DOCUMENTATION

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:26.155
STATUS IS ANOTHER POPULATION

01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:27.389
THAT WILL BE --

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:29.191
ABLE TO USE THE FULL SCOPE OF

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:30.893
THE SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.561
SERVICES EITHER IF THEY'RE AT

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:35.431
UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE OR

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:39.401
IF THERE OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:40.169
FIVE TWENTY ONE I THINK --

01:10:40.235 --> 01:10:42.071
THE ONE OF THE MORE NOTABLE

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:44.306
THINGS ABOUT CALIFORNIA --

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:46.275
IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE --

01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:48.010
TAKEN A LOT OF STEPS OVER THE

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:48.944
COURSES --

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:51.013
TIME TO ADOPT DIFFERENT

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.247
FINANCING --

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:53.949
MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT STATE

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:54.917
GOALS AND THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:56.452
SERVICES ACT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:58.454
THOSE IN WHICH THE FUNDS THAT

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.055
FLOW TO THE COUNTIES --

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:04.627
THROUGH AN HSA ARE SAYS AND

01:11:04.693 --> 01:11:06.028
SUPPORT --

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:07.396
DIRECT SERVICES AND SUPPORT

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:09.832
THOSE FUNDS ARE NOT AND TIED TO

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:11.600
MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY PER SE THEY

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.268
CAN BE USED ON OTHER POPULATIONS

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:14.470
AND SO.

01:11:14.536 --> 01:11:16.238
I WOULD PROBABLY DEFER TO I'M

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:17.673
KAREN FOR YOU KNOW KIND OF

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:18.674
SPECIFICS AROUND WHAT THE

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:19.875
COUNTIES ARE USING WITH THOSE

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.810
FUNDS BUT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.379
FLEXIBLE FUND SOURCES SO THAT IF

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:24.446
AN INDIVIDUAL.

01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:26.048
THAT IS UNDOCUMENTED --

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:28.083
COMES TO A COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH --

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:30.052
PROGRAM AND SAYS I'M IN NEED OF

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.520
MEDICAL SERVICES THEY CAN USE

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:33.055
OTHER FUN SOURCES THAT ARE NOT

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.657
RELATED --

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:36.592
TO MEDI CAL ENTITLEMENT FUNDS I

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:37.826
THINK ALSO --

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:39.261
FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN A

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:42.331
QUEUE CRISIS AND IN NEED OF

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:44.733
INPATIENT SERVICES THERE ARE ON

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.101
CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE STATE

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.703
WOULD BE PAIN UNDER LIMITED

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.605
SCOPE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:51.373
ESPECIALLY IF SOMEONE HAD --

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.475
SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS LIKE A

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:54.410
FIFTY ONE FIFTY DESIGNATION AND

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:55.744
WERE HARM TO THEMSELVES OR TO

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.312
SOMEONE ELSE AND SO.

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:58.213
IT'S NOT --

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.448
IDEAL AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:00.683
STEPS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BOTH

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:02.651
TAKEN AND ARE PREPARING TO TAKE

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:03.552
AROUND.

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:05.721
INCREASING COVERAGE IN PROVIDING

01:12:05.788 --> 01:12:09.625
FULL SCOPE TO KAREN ON CHINESE

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:14.329
PAY FOR A I'M SO GLAD SHE'S JUST

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:16.432
DID USE AN HSA FUNDS TO FUND OUR

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:18.467
LOCAL PROGRAM WHERE WE USE PROMO

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:20.636
TORAS TO DO OUT REACH INTO OUR

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:23.072
MIGRANT CAMPS AND IT'S ACTUALLY

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:24.573
WITH OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH OUR

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:24.973
LOCAL COMMUNITY.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.376
HEALTH CENTER WHERE MANY OF OUR

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:28.944
POPULATION WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:29.945
ALREADY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.380
BECAUSE IT'S A MIGRANT HEALTH

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:32.514
CENTER AND SO.

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:34.483
IT NOT ONLY HAD THE BENEFIT OF

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:35.517
FUNDING MEANT THE REAL HEALTH

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:37.386
SERVICES BUT ALLOWED THEM TO

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:38.620
HAVE NO STIGMA THEY CAN GO IN

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:40.322
THE SAME DOOR TO SEE THEIR

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:41.190
DOCTOR AS THEY SEE THE

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:42.858
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER.

01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:45.627
AND CULTURALLY THAT'S A LOT MORE

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:46.762
APPROPRIATE THAN ASKING THEM TO

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:48.564
COME TO MY BUILDING WHERE IF YOU

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.866
GO THROUGH A CERTAIN DOOR

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:53.268
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY'RE IS

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:53.502
THERE.

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:54.470
IS THERE ANY CONNECTION AS FAR

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.605
AS THE NEEDS --

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:59.908
AND OR ACCESS BETWEEN THE YOUTH

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:02.978
HAVING ACCESS BUT NOT THOSE.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.347
OVER --

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:06.415
NINETEEN RIGHT NOW.

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:09.384
NO THAT WAS IS IT IMPACT --

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.353
THEIR ABILITY OR THEIR

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:14.389
MOTIVATION OR DO THEY FEEL.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:15.958
LIKE THEY SHOULDN'T TO GOAL --

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:18.026
HOW HAVE YOU SEEN ANY

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:19.762
INDICATIONS OF?

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:21.563
THE FACT THAT WE'RE SPLITTING UP

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:23.599
YEAH.

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:24.700
FAMILIES.

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:26.368
FROM THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:27.736
THOSE WHO ARE NOT.

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:29.104
WELL AND I'M I'M NOT A CLINICIAN

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:31.106
BUT I WILL CERTAINLY TRY TO PLAY

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:34.209
ONE ON TV RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT --

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:34.543
I KNOW THAT --

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:38.046
TYPICALLY AND THEN A Q.

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:40.182
PSYCHOTIC BREAK OR SCHIZOPHRENIA

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:41.350
IS USUALLY DIAGNOSED WHEN

01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:42.618
SOMEONE IS IN THEIR LATE TEENS

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:44.286
EARLY TWENTIES.

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:45.554
I THINK THAT AND THIS IS NOT

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:46.789
JUST TO THE UNDOCUMENTED

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:48.891
POPULATION BUT TO ANY POPULATION

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:52.528
AND CALIFORNIA THAT WE SERVE --

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:54.797
THE PTSD T. MANDATE AROUND

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:56.131
SERVICES --

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:57.966
FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF

01:13:58.033 --> 01:13:58.834
TWENTY ONE SO IN MEDI CAL THE

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:00.736
PST T. BENEFIT IS A BROAD

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:02.671
BENEFIT THAT SAYS ESSENTIALLY WE

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:05.307
HAVE TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:06.708
AMELIORATE ADDRESS.

01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:08.877
THE CONDITION --

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.846
AND SO THAT REALLY MEANS THAT

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:12.181
THEY HAVE A LOT MORE SERVICES

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:14.383
AVAILABLE TO THEM --

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:15.684
ESPECIALLY AROUND MENTAL HEALTH

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:17.052
AND THEN WHEN THEY HIT THE AGE

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:18.821
OF TWENTY ONE THAT MANDATE IS NO

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:21.123
LONGER APPLICABLE AND MEDI CAL

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.658
FOR ANY POPULATION AND SO.

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:26.862
IN SOME CASES IT'S IT IS AN

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:27.396
UNFORTUNATE RUBBED THAT

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:29.131
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PROBABLY

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:30.465
JUST BEING DIAGNOSED WITH A

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:31.633
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WOULD

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.235
ALSO BE AT THE POINT IN TIME IN

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.137
WHICH THE MANDATE FOUR EPS DUE

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:38.507
TO SOME SERVICES AND THOSE TYPES

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:39.942
OF AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES.

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:40.943
DISAPPEARS --

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:42.077
IF THEY'RE STILL MEDI CAL

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.045
ELIGIBLE OBVIOUSLY THEY STILL

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:45.180
ARE ACCESSING SERVICES BUT THE

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:46.915
BROADNESS OF THAT BENEFIT IS

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.817
REALLY KIND OF SPECIFIC AN

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:50.819
INDICATIVE JUST TO TO CHILDREN

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:52.521
UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE I

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:53.989
THINK THAT --

01:14:54.056 --> 01:14:57.259
JUST BY THE NATURE OF WE'LL SKIP

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:59.428
SERVICES TO THIS POPULATION --

01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:01.396
A IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE BOTH THE

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:02.764
CHILD I'M A CERTAINLY AS THEY

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:04.633
GET OLDER BUT ALSO THE PARENTS

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.001
KNOW THAT THE SERVICES EXIST

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:08.170
SOME OF THESE CHILDREN --

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:09.571
MAY FIRST ENCOUNTER A MENTAL

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:10.405
HEALTH PROFESSIONAL IN THE

01:15:10.472 --> 01:15:11.974
SCHOOL SYSTEM WHICH I THINK WE

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.243
HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT --

01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:15.744
BUT IF THE CHILD HAS A

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:17.379
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUE OR SEER

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:18.513
SUMMERS MOTION DISTURBANCE

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.148
SOMETIMES THAT IS MANIFESTING IN

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:21.183
THE SCHOOL SETTING.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:22.484
IN WHICH THE SCHOOL WITHIN REACH

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:23.919
OUT TO THE COUNTY --

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:24.720
IN THERE WOULD BE A REFERRAL

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:26.088

IT'S ALSO PARENT --

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:37.966
IMPORTANT FOR THE PARENTS TO

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:40.369

SYSTEM IS FRAGMENTED YOU'VE

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:50.018
HEARD ABOUT THAT.

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:51.153
I THINK QUITE A BIT.

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:52.721
THEY FINANCIAL INCENTIVES WHEN

01:19:52.787 --> 01:19:54.723
YOU BIFURCATED SYSTEM ARE TO

01:19:54.789 --> 01:19:56.725
DENY CARE AND TO REFER PEOPLE TO

01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:58.026
THE OTHER SYSTEM.

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.861
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TODAY THAT

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:01.129
IS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:02.063
FUNDING STREAMS AND

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:03.632
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S WHAT

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:05.867
HAPPENS TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:06.902
PARTICULAR.

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:09.571
IT'S NOT DESIGNED WITH BENEFITS

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:10.105
YEARS AT THE CENTER OF THE

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.740
SYSTEM --

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:13.108
YOU'VE KNOW THAT THEIR FIFTY SIX

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:14.676
MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THERE ARE

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:15.944
TWENTY TWO HEALTH PLANS ARE IN

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:17.546
MULTIPLE COUNTIES --

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:19.447
THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:20.615
CARE SERVICES IS DIRECTLY

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:22.784
RESPONSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THIS

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:24.653
ENTITLEMENT IS DELIVERED TO

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:25.720
CHILDREN IN YEARS.

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:27.355
AND THERE IS NOT ENOUGH

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:29.457
OVERSIGHT OF MENTAL HEALTH PLANS

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:30.625
AND HEALTH PLANS TO MAKE SURE

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.727
THAT HAPPENS.

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:34.129
THIS IS AN A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:34.930
E. PST T. THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:36.464
ABOUT AND IT SHOULD NOT BE

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.099
DELIVERED DIFFERENTLY IN EVERY

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.367
COUNTY AND IT SHOULD NOT BE THAT

01:20:39.434 --> 01:20:41.002
YOU CAN GET A SERVICE AND ONE

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:42.304
CAN YOU CAN GET IN AND OTHER.

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:44.539
THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE

01:20:44.606 --> 01:20:45.173
FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT [inaudible]

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.708
SO.

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:47.576
REALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:49.077
BENEFICIAL LEFT ON THEIR OWN AND

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:50.078
IF THEY'RE LUCKY THEY GO TO A

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:51.279
LEGAL SERVICES ATTORNEY AND

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:53.281
MAYBE THAT I GET A CALL AND WE

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:53.915
TRY TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH THAT

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:56.318
SYSTEM. THREE OF THE ISSUES I

01:20:56.384 --> 01:20:58.153
THINK I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT

01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:59.621
MAKE THIS MOST CHALLENGING ART.

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.623
THEN LACK OF REFERRAL TRACKING

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.124
BETWEEN THE PLANS.

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:05.060
THE INADEQUATE COORDINATION AND

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:07.562
THE LACK OR THE THE LACK OF

01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:08.964
ACCESS TO CONTINUITY OF CARE.

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.032
SO JUST BRIEFLY.

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:13.068
THE THERE IS NO REAL REQUIREMENT

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:14.636
THAT.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:15.870
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE BEING

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:17.272
SURVIVAL SYSTEMS ARE BEING

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:19.908
TRACKED AND THAT THAT.

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:21.876
THAT THE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS

01:21:21.943 --> 01:21:23.411
BEING SEEN BY ONE IS ACT THEY

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:24.512
ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:25.547
WITH THE OTHER SYSTEM.

01:21:25.614 --> 01:21:27.549
THAT'S PARTLY DUE TO THE LACK OF

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:28.850
REQUIREMENT THAT THEY TRACK IT'S

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:30.151
ALSO DO THE FACT THAT THE DATA

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:31.019
SYSTEMS ARE COMPLETELY

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:32.187
INCOMPATIBLE.

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:33.455
AND SO EVEN THOSE GOOD HEALTH

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:34.723
PLANS THAT ARE ACTUALLY DOING

01:21:34.789 --> 01:21:36.124
TRACKING THEY'RE DOING IT

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:37.359
MANUALLY.

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:40.495
NOT AN AUTOMATED WAY AND SO NG

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:41.696
IS THOSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:43.064
BASICALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:45.066
WHAT SERVICES THOSE CHILDREN AND

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.301
YOUTH ARE GETTING AND THEY

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:48.069
OFTENTIMES DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:49.371
OTHER SYSTEMS PROVIDING AYE

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:50.672
MEANS NOT JUST HEALTH CARE BUT

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:53.441
IT'S MENTAL HEALTH CARE --

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:54.476
SECONDLY THE IN TERMS OF AN

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:56.611
ADEQUATE COORDINATION DESPITE

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:57.746
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

01:21:57.812 --> 01:21:59.080
REGULATIONS ON THE BOOKS.

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:01.349
IN TITLE NINE THAT REQUIRE THAT

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:02.384
THERE BE A MEMORANDUM OF

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:04.085
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN EACH PLAN

01:22:04.152 --> 01:22:05.920
IN EACH MENTAL HEALTH PLAN.

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:07.589
THOSE MEMORANDUMS OF

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:09.090
UNDERSTANDING ARE VERY DIFFERENT

01:22:09.157 --> 01:22:11.726
THEY'RE ALL VASTLY --

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:12.961
YOU KNOW A DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF

01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:14.729
BOTH THE AMOUNT AND THE TYPE OF

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:16.331
COORDINATION THAT'S OCCURRING IN

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:17.832
THE DETAIL THAT'S IN THOSE

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:18.066
MENTAL.

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:19.968
HEALTH MO USE WE'VE ANALYZED

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:22.971
EVERYONE OF THEM IN A REPORT

01:22:23.038 --> 01:22:23.972
THAT WE DID IN NOVEMBER --

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:25.073
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO AS A

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.509
RESULT OF THAT THERE'S REALLY IN

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:29.177
QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN HOW

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:30.445
THAT COORDINATION IS HAPPENING

01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:32.047
OR NOT HAPPENING.

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.015
AND THAT LACK OF KIND OF

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:35.350
CONTINUITY OF COORDINATION

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:37.819
ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT.

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:39.187
PEOPLE ARE GOING FROM PLAN TO

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:41.389
PLAN AND THERE REALLY ISN'T A

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:43.658
HAND OFF IT'S LIKE OKAY YOU GET

01:22:43.725 --> 01:22:44.659
FROM ONE PLAN.

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:46.227
AND YOU GET SET HANDED OFF TO

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.729
THE OTHER PLAN AND THEY DON'T

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:48.596
REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:50.231
THAT AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.599
MEANS THAT.

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.501
PEOPLE ARE ENDING UP REALLY

01:22:53.568 --> 01:22:55.704
SCOTT BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS.

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:56.838
SO -- KIND

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.206
OF THIRD I WANT TO SAY THAT THE

01:22:58.273 --> 01:22:59.808
LACK OF CONTINUITY OF CARE SO

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:01.343
PARTLY THAT'S DUE TO LACK OF

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:02.777
TRACKING THAT WE JUST TALKED

01:23:02.844 --> 01:23:05.013
ABOUT THE LACK OF REFERRAL

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.615
COORDINATION OF CARE --

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:08.216
IT LITERALLY LEADS TO PROBLEMS

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:09.951
WITH CONTINUITY OF CARE

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:11.219
SENSUALLY GET CAUGHT IN THE

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:12.620
MIDDLE SO.

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:14.055
THERE'S ALSO NO GUIDANCE BY THE

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:15.790
DEPARTMENT REALLY IN THIS AREA

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:17.225
THERE SOME RECENT GUIDANCE BUT

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:18.393
IT'S REALLY NOT ENOUGH IN TERMS

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.662
OF ENSURING THAT INDIVIDUALS

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:22.063
AREN'T HAVING THEIR CARE.

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.866
LAPS OR BEING INTERRUPTED IN THE

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:26.034
MIDDLE OF TREATMENT SO.

01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:28.203
IT IN PARTICULAR THE EXAMPLE I

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:31.406
GAVE YOU IS ABOUT WHERE THERE IS.

01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:32.807
A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PLANS

01:23:32.874 --> 01:23:34.409
ABOUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AGAIN

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:35.543
YOU'D THINK THAT THERE'D BE A

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.212
WAY TO WORK THAT OUT WHAT

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:38.146
HAPPENS IS THE BENEFITS YOU JUST

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:39.748
LEFT CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE EVEN

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.483
THOUGH THEY CAN FILE A GRIEVANCE.

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:43.184
THEY CAN USE THOSE LEGAL

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:44.919
REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT

01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:46.287
BUT OFTEN TIMES IT DOESN'T

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.189
RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND YOU'VE

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:49.057
GOT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT LAYERS

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:50.992
OF KIND OF DUE PROCESS THAT YOU

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:52.260
HAVE TO GO THROUGH INCLUDING

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:55.964
FAIR HEARING RIGHTS TO GET.

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.531
TO A RESOLUTION WHICH TAKES

01:23:56.598 --> 01:23:57.899
MONTHS --

01:23:57.966 --> 01:24:01.469
ALSO AT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:02.637
NO CONTINUITY OF NETWORK.

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.472
OF OF THE OF A NETWORK BETWEEN

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:05.840
THE PLANS WHICH IS WHAT ALSO

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:07.609
EXACERBATES THIS PROBLEM.

01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:08.910
YOU MAY END UP WITH A CHILD OR

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:10.645
YOUTH BEING SERVED BY ONE SYSTEM

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.213
AND HAVING LET'S SAY

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.615
PSYCHOTHERAPIST AND THEN.

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:15.483
HAVING TO BE SORT OF HANDED OFF

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:16.851
TO ANOTHER SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:18.686
NOT HAPPEN AND START OVER WITH A

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:20.088
NEW THERAPIST THAT'S NOT THE

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:22.056
STANDARD PRACTICE THAT SHOULD BE

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:25.160
HAPPENING TODAY --

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:27.395
JUST KIND OF FINALLY I THINK ON

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:29.697
THIS ISSUE OF CONNIE DO CARE.

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:31.599
THERE ARE ALSO THERE'S A STATE

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:33.368
WAY THAT THEY HAVE DIVIDED UP

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:35.069
RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN PLANS

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:36.204
WHICH YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:37.572
IN LESS HEARING AROUND MILD TO

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:40.408
MODERATE TO SEVERE IMPAIRMENTS.

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:41.276
THIS BILL --

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:42.911
I KNOW I'VE EXHAUSTED BILLY

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:45.046
ADVOCATE ON THIS ISSUE BUT THERE

01:24:45.113 --> 01:24:46.681
SHOULD NOT BE APPLYING THIS

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.583
REQUIREMENT TO CHILDREN.

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:50.385
THIS IS THE ENTIRE APS SEED

01:24:50.452 --> 01:24:52.253
ENTITLEMENT IS VERY BROAD AND

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.322
KIDS SHOULD NOT BE TURNED AWAY

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:55.557
FROM CARE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:56.758
SEVERE IMPAIRMENT A MILD OR

01:24:56.825 --> 01:24:58.827
MODERATE IMPAIRMENT IT IS ABOUT

01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:00.028
WHAT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY.

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:02.063
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THESE KIDS

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:03.164
DO GET TURNED AWAY AND WE'VE

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:04.833
SEEN THAT ROUTINELY IN

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:05.400
PARTICULAR BY MENTAL HEALTH

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:06.234
PLANS.

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:08.102
THROUGH SCREENING MECHANISMS ARE

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:12.373
OTHER WAYS OF DENYING KIDS CARE --

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:12.974
AT THE FRONT END BECAUSE THEY

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:15.810
DON'T ALSO BECAUSE THE

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:17.145
REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE ON THE

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:18.446
BOOKS AROUND MEDICAL NECESSITY

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.482
ARE VERY CONVOLUTED AND THEY'RE

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:22.517
IN CONSISTENT WITH THE STATUTE.

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:23.852
FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY WHICH WE

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:26.187
FIX LAST YEAR IN THE LEGISLATION --

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:29.357
THROUGH SB.

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:30.158
TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN SO HOW DO WE

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:32.727
BETTER INTEGRATE THAT CERTAIN

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:33.895
THOSE GET THAT CARE I MEAN I

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.563
HAVE NOT COME TO THIS DECISION

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:37.565
LIGHTLY BUT OVER MANY MANY YEARS

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:38.933
OF BEING INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:39.801
I HAVE.

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:41.836
NOW TAKEN THE POSITION THAT I

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:43.271
THINK A FULLY INTEGRATED SYSTEM

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:45.240
IS THE DIRECTION THAT WE NEED TO

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:45.740
GO IN.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.375
WE HAVE MANY MANY YEARS OF

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:50.044
EXPERIENCE OF FRAGMENTED

01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:51.679
DELIVERY SYSTEM WE HAVE.

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:53.548
AS YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER ON THE

01:25:53.615 --> 01:25:54.649
PANEL.

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:55.250
YOU KNOW YOU SEEN ONE CAN YOU

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:56.551
SEEN ONE COUNTY THAT IS NOT AN

01:25:56.618 --> 01:25:58.453
ENTITLEMENT THAT IS ABOUT A A

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.488
FRAGMENTED SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT

01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:01.155
WORK.

01:26:01.222 --> 01:26:02.924
BUT IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME TO

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:04.492
GET THAT TO BE DONE RIGHT

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:05.760
THERE'S GONNA NEED TO BE A VERY

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.328
CAREFUL STAKEHOLDER PROCESS

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:08.396
THERE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:10.031
GUARDRAILS PUT IN PLACE THERE'S

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:11.366
GOING TO BE NEED TO BE.

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:12.901
READING THE STANDARDS DEVELOPED

01:26:12.967 --> 01:26:14.035
AND IN PARTICULAR FOR CHILDREN

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:17.171
AND YOUTH BECAUSE THE SERVICES.

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:18.306
IN SPECIALTY MAHAL BUT CHILDREN

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:19.707
YOUTH GET ARE VERY DIFFERENT

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:21.209
THAN A MEDICAL MODEL TYPE OF

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:22.844
SERVICE THAT'S DELIVERED AN

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.345
OFFICER IN A CLINIC.

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:25.780
THAT MOST OF THE HEALTH PLANS

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:26.981
ARE FAMILIAR WITH IN A

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:28.182
COMMERCIAL SIDE.

01:26:28.249 --> 01:26:29.450
THERE ARE HOME AND COMMUNITY

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:31.386
BASED SERVICES THEY COULD BE

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.687
PROVIDED ON THE SOCCER FIELD

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:34.522
THAT COULD PROVIDE IN THE HOME.

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:37.091
IT COULD BE PROVIDED IN THE

01:26:37.158 --> 01:26:37.325
SCHOOL.

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:40.662
BUT THERE ARE SERVE AT TIMES AND

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:42.163
THERE PROVIDED A LOT OF TIMES BY

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:43.831
PARA PROFESSIONALS UNDER THE

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:45.199
CLINICAL SUPERVISION.

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:46.768
AND THOSE ARE SERVICES THAT ARE

01:26:46.834 --> 01:26:47.969
NOT EASY TO DELIVER THEIR

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.637
FIDELITY PRACTICE THAT NEEDS TO

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:51.205
BE LEARNED AND IT NEEDS TO BE

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:52.040
CONTINUED SO.

01:26:52.106 --> 01:26:54.042
THAT THAT NETWORK NEEDS TO BE IN

01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:55.710
PLACE IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE --

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:58.146
MOVING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OR

01:26:58.212 --> 01:26:58.746
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HEALTH

01:26:58.813 --> 01:26:59.647
PLAN.

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:01.115
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO NOW IN SORT

01:27:01.182 --> 01:27:03.051
OF IT I'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT

01:27:03.117 --> 01:27:04.752
IS PUT IN PLACE SOME LEGISLATION

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:06.154
THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.855
RIGHT NOW TODAY.

01:27:07.922 --> 01:27:10.258
THAT REFERRAL IN TRACKING SYSTEM

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:11.993
BETTER COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.828
AND MORE ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.630
AND ALSO --

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:16.664
TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS KIND OF

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:17.498
THE OF CARE AND THAT'S GONNA

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:18.967
REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY

01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:20.902
DO MORE THAN IT'S DOING TODAY TO

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:22.804
OVERSEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:23.271
STATE.

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:25.506
IT IS NOT OKAY FOR THE STATE

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:27.408
DEPARTMENT TO SAY WE ARE NOT

01:27:27.475 --> 01:27:28.810
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:29.844
A PARTICULAR COUNTY BECAUSE A

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:31.379
REALIGNMENT FUNDING OR ANY OTHER

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:33.948
REASON IT IS A MEDICAID

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:34.549
ENTITLEMENT AND THERE IS THE

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:36.551
OTHER SINGLE STATE AGENCY

01:27:36.618 --> 01:27:38.753
RESPONSIBLE --

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.288
SO I BELIEVE IN MY WRITTEN

01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:43.558
TESTIMONY AND ALSO I'M OPEN FOR

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:44.692

WE'LL WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS AT

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:49.097
THE END SO.

GO AHEAD DR KERR [inaudible]

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:53.468

I'M WE UNDERTAKE HARVEY

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:56.237
REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:56.971
COUNCIL FOR COMMUNITY BE EVER

MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE

01:28:00.074 --> 01:28:01.109
DISORDERS --

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:02.377
NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:04.112
ORGANIZATION TO CONTRACT WITH

01:28:04.178 --> 01:28:05.480
COUNTY SAN THANK YOU FOR THE

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:07.181
OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A SUMMARY

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:08.683
OF OUR MEMBERS FEEDBACK OF

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:10.051
WHAT'S WORKING WELL AND AREAS OF

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:11.753
IMPROVEMENT FOR CHILDREN'S

01:28:11.819 --> 01:28:13.087
MEDICAL SERVICES.

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:14.589
SO GENERALLY LET'S START OFF

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.257
WITH THE POSITIVE ARE PROVIDERS

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:18.459
APPRECIATE WHEN THINGS WORK WALL

01:28:18.526 --> 01:28:19.093
THEY CAN WORK WITHIN A

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.162
COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF CARE

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:22.497
THAT IS TAILORED TO THE

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:23.631
POPULATION THAT SERVED.

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:25.333
IN INCLUDES ACCESS TO CARE

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.635
ELEMENTS SUCH AS NO COPAY A WIDE

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:29.470
ARRAY OF SERVICES AND IT

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:30.705
REIMBURSES PROVIDERS FOR THEIR

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:32.674
TOTAL CLINICAL AND CASE

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:33.941
MANAGEMENT TIME.

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.243
BUT THEY SEE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:36.944
IMPROVEMENT AS FOLLOWS THE

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:38.279
CURRENT COST REIMBURSEMENT

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:40.481
SYSTEM IS VERY RESTRICTIVE FOR

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:41.783
EXAMPLE THE MINUTE BY MINUTE

01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:43.551
BILLING DOES NOT INCENTIVIZE

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.453
PROVIDERS TO FOCUS ON VALUE

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.922
BASED CARE AND OUTCOMES AS MISS

LARSEN NOTED IN HER OPENING

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:50.391
COMMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE IT ALSO

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:52.226
DISK DIFFICULT TO GET MENTALLY

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:53.628
ILL CHILDREN THE RESIDENTIAL

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:55.196
CARE WHEN NEEDED AT THIS

01:28:55.263 --> 01:28:56.664
POPULATION REQUIRES MULTIPLE

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:58.533
SERVICES AND RESOURCES AND IT'S

01:28:58.599 --> 01:29:01.002
QUITE BURDENSOME ON PROVIDERS.

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:03.805
WHEN WE LOOK AT SCHOOL BASED

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:06.274
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT TING

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.142
SILOS SO THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE

01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:09.644
ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES FOR

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:11.179
THEIR BEHAVIOR AND EDUCATION

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:13.314
NEED REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE OR

01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:14.716
MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY?

01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:16.718
AND OVERWHELMINGLY OUR PROVIDER

01:29:16.784 --> 01:29:18.519
SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT BURDEN SOME

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:20.488
CLINICAL CHARTING STANDARDS AND

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:22.056
THE NEED FOR PAPERWORK REDUCTION

01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:23.858
AND UNIFORMITY AND PAPERWORK

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:25.526
STANDARD ACROSS ALL OF THE

01:29:25.593 --> 01:29:27.628
COUNTY OF LOS THE TRANSITION

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:29.664
FROM IN A CHILDREN'S MEDICAL --

01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:30.998
MEDICAL EXCUSE ME MEDICAL TWO

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:33.101
ADULTS SERVICES WHEN THEY TURN

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:34.035
TWENTY ONE CAN BE REALLY ABRUPT

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.570
AND WARRANTS BETTER CONTINUITY

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:36.771
OF CARE.

01:29:36.838 --> 01:29:38.272
AS WAS JUST MENTIONED.

01:29:38.339 --> 01:29:39.540
NO ONE WE EXAMINE THE MENTAL

01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:41.809
HEALTH PLANS PROVIDERS DESIRE

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:43.544
BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN

01:29:43.611 --> 01:29:45.513
COUNTY MH PEAS ONE CLIENTS MOVE

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.448
BETWEEN COUNTY SERVICES ARE

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:48.850
OFTEN DROPPED OR DELAYED AS WAS

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:49.784
NOTED DURING THIS LIST OF

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:51.085
TESTIMONY.

01:29:51.152 --> 01:29:52.120
AND THEY'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:54.288
THE CURRENT SYSTEM'S INABILITY

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:55.656
TO GET A FIX CLIENTS WAS FINDING

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:56.758
A PROVIDER WHEN THEY NEED A

01:29:56.824 --> 01:29:58.459
LOWER LEVEL OF KERR WHEN THEY'RE

01:29:58.526 --> 01:29:58.960
DOING WELL.

01:29:59.026 --> 01:30:00.228
MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

01:30:00.294 --> 01:30:02.530
TYPICALLY HAVE FEWER LOCATIONS

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:03.931
AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS PROVIDE

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:07.101
ROBUST COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:07.969
HAS.

01:30:08.035 --> 01:30:08.636
SO IT'S CLEAR TO ALL OF US THAT

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:09.971
THE INTEGRATION OF BEHAVIORAL

01:30:10.037 --> 01:30:11.572
HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IS

01:30:11.639 --> 01:30:12.340
ESSENTIAL.

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:13.207
I IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA

01:30:13.274 --> 01:30:14.842
HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION RELEASED A

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.310
REPORT JUST LAST MONTH THAT

01:30:16.377 --> 01:30:18.246
FOCUSED ON THIS GOAL. TO THIS

01:30:18.312 --> 01:30:19.847
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:21.783
MONTHS FIRST FUND PILOT PROGRAMS

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:23.818
THAT TEST THE INTEGRATION OF

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:24.652
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.053
HEALTH AND COMMUNITY BASED

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:26.988
SETTINGS.

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:28.089
WE ALSO THINK THAT STATES AND

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:29.590
COUNTY SHOULD INVEST MORE IN

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:30.858
HEALTH IN OUR INFORMATION

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:33.127
EXCHANGES AND PROVIDE THESE TO

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:34.762
CBO'S SO THAT AN INDIVIDUAL'S

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.731
COLLECTIVE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:37.799
RECORD PLATFORM CAN SHARE

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:39.467
INFORMATION WHEREVER THEY GO FOR

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:40.735
TREATMENT.

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:41.769
WE ALSO BELIEVE IN BROADENING

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:43.404
THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:44.972
NECESSITY FOR CHILDREN.

01:30:45.039 --> 01:30:47.041
IF THE STATE VIEW CHILDREN'S

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:48.876
ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:50.745
THE SAME WAY WE VIEW PHYSICAL

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:52.580
HEALTH VACCINATIONS MORE KIDS

01:30:52.647 --> 01:30:54.215
WOULD GET SERVICES REGARDLESS OF

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.984
WHETHER THEY MEET MEDICAL

01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:58.986
NECESSITY CRITERIA.

01:30:59.053 --> 01:31:00.054
I KNOW TIME IS SHORT PSALTIS AND

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:00.621
WITH A QUOTE FROM ONE OF OUR

01:31:00.688 --> 01:31:01.222
PROVIDERS.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:04.325
COUNTY AGENCIES ARE STAFFED BY

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:05.827
ESPECIALLY THE PROGRAM OFFICIALS

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:07.094
AND STAFF THAT WE KNOW AN INTER

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:08.863
INTERACT WITH HOWEVER BY THE

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:10.731
VERY NATURE OF LARGE GOVERNMENT

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:11.966
ENTITIES.

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:13.034
IT'S INEVITABLE THAT THERE'S

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.335
GOING TO BE AND INEFFICIENCIES

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:16.103
BUT PROVIDERS HAVE THE ABILITY

01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:17.939
TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:19.574
NEEDS OF CLIENTS BY SCALING AND

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.375
ADJUSTING SERVICES IN A NUMBER

01:31:21.442 --> 01:31:22.310
OF FASHION.

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:24.512
SO COUNTY AGENCIES AND PROVIDERS

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:25.713
NEED TO WORK TOGETHER THEIR

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:27.281
NATURAL PARTNERS THEY CAN REALLY

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:29.016
ENRICH OUR COMMUNITIES YET WE

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:30.318
CONTINUE TO CRY OUT FOR THE

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:31.953
ABILITY AND PERMISSION TO JUST

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:34.121
BE MORE EFFICIENT.

01:31:57.845 --> 01:31:59.146
SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA.

01:31:59.213 --> 01:32:00.214
CHILDREN HAVE SUFFERED ABUSE AND

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:01.549
NEGLECT IN CHILDREN WHO ARE

LIVING IN POVERTY OFTEN VERY

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:05.853
DEEP POVERTY WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.321
THE CHILDREN IN OUR SYSTEM.

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:08.990
A 100% OF THE CHILDREN IN UP IN

THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM HAVE

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:12.260
EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA.

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:13.995
NOT JUST FROM THE ABUSE AND

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:15.029
NEGLECT THE BECAUSE THE

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:15.997
INTERVENTION BUT FROM THE

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:19.233
REMOVAL ITSELF AND BEING PLACED --

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:20.801
IN OUT OF HOME CARE.

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:23.371
ON CHILDREN AND CAL WORKS

01:32:23.437 --> 01:32:26.207
FAMILIES LIVE EXPERIENCE

01:32:26.274 --> 01:32:27.808
MULTIPLE TRAUMAS IN CALIFORNIA

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:30.177
ALMOST 20% 21%.

01:32:30.244 --> 01:32:31.979
OF CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY IN

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.714
ANOTHER 25% ARE LIVING NEAR THE

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:34.982
POVERTY LINE.

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:35.983
AND WE DO KNOW THAT LEFT

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:37.351
UNTREATED TRAMMELL HAVE A

01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:39.086
LIFELONG IMPACT ON THEIR BRAIN

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:41.022
DEVELOPMENT AND THAT OFTEN LEADS

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:42.023
TO CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AND

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:43.524
OTHER POOR OUTCOMES.

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:46.594
THAT ARE VERY COSTLY TO SOCIETY.

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:48.329
NATIONAL STUDIES FIND THAT 70%

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:49.664
OF FOSTER CHILDREN HAVE

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:51.032
SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS

01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:52.900
YET COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE BEING

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:54.302
MEANING FULLY SERVED.

01:32:54.368 --> 01:32:55.803
AND OUR CURRENT SPECIALTY MENTAL

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:57.171
HEALTH SYSTEM --

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:58.439
AND I WOULD POINT OUT SOMETHING

01:32:58.506 --> 01:32:59.440
THAT -- AT

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:00.841
THE LAST HEARING MUCH THERE WAS

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:02.543
MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:04.445
PENETRATION RATES --

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:06.480
THE PENETRATION RATE ON THE

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:08.316
DEFINITION OF IT IS ONE CONTACT

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:10.651
A YEAR AND THAT CONTACT COULD BE

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:11.719
AN ASSESSMENT.

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:13.220
AND THE FINDING THAT THE CHILD

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:15.156
IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ANY FURTHER

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:16.223
SERVICES.

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:17.658
SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WORK

01:33:17.725 --> 01:33:19.126
WITH ADVOCATES TO COME UP WITH

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:20.561
AN ENGAGEMENT TRAIT IT'S FIVE

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:21.829
CONTACTS YEAR.

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:23.331
AND IT REALLY REFLECTS MORE

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:24.732
MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE

01:33:24.799 --> 01:33:25.733
SYSTEM [inaudible]

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.437
I IN --

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:32.073
CALIFORNIA 36% OF FOSTER KIDS

01:33:32.139 --> 01:33:34.008
STATEWIDE MEET THE ENGAGEMENT

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:35.042
RATE -- IT'S

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:37.078
DECLINING IT VERY SIGNIFICANTLY

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:38.446
FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY.

01:33:38.512 --> 01:33:40.014
THAT'S COMPARED TO NATIONAL

01:33:40.081 --> 01:33:42.149
STUDIES THAT SUGGEST THAT 70% OF

01:33:42.216 --> 01:33:43.017
KIDS.

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:44.652
IN FOSTER CARE HAD SIGNIFICANT

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:46.454
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. FOR ALL

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.521
CHILDREN NOT JUST FOSTER%

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:49.190
CHILDREN FOR ALL CHILDREN ON

01:33:49.256 --> 01:33:50.391
MEDI CAL THE SPECIALTY MAIL HELP

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.793
PENETRATION RATE IS ABOUT 4%.

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:55.663
THE ENGAGEMENT RATE IS ABOUT 3%

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:58.733
AND BOTH ARE DECLINING --

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:00.301
OFTEN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:01.802
HAVE BEEN SERVED UNDER

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:03.170
TRADITIONAL MEDICAL MODEL THAT

01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:04.972
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.207
FOR KIDS IN THE CHILD WELFARE

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:07.608
SYSTEM IN KIDS OF EXPERIENCE

01:34:07.675 --> 01:34:09.176
SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA.

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:10.978
THE FIFTY MINUTE OFFICE VISIT IN

01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:12.680
A CLINICAL SETTING IS NOT WHAT

01:34:12.747 --> 01:34:13.714
MAKES SENSE FOR THEM THEY MORE

01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:15.716
OFTEN BENEFIT FROM SOCIAL MODEL

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:16.984
COMMUNITY AND HOME BASED

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:18.853
SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED IN

01:34:18.919 --> 01:34:20.087
THE CONTEXT OF THE COMMUNITIES.

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:21.756
WHERE WE NOT JUST TREAT THE

01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:22.656
NEEDS OF THE CHILD BUT WE

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:24.825
SIMULTANEOUSLY SUPPORT THE NEEDS

01:34:24.892 --> 01:34:26.660
OF THE CARE GIVERS?

01:34:26.727 --> 01:34:27.561
THERE ARE VERY FEW MENTAL HEALTH

01:34:27.628 --> 01:34:28.829
SERVICES FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE

01:34:28.896 --> 01:34:30.398
AGE OF EIGHT DESPITE WHAT WE

01:34:30.464 --> 01:34:32.233
KNOW ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF TRAUMA

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:34.435
ON YOUNG DEVELOPING BRAINS.

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:37.038
SO FROM THAT STANDPOINT OF THE

01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:38.572
SYSTEM THAT ENGAGES IN KIDS AT

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:40.141
ITS SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA

01:34:40.207 --> 01:34:41.742
WHAT WE NEED --

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:44.578
OUR KID NEEDS KIDS NEED SERVICES

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.582
CONTEXT OF THEIR FAMILIES AND

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:51.152
THEIR COMMUNITIES --

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:52.586
AND WE NEED SUPPORT FOR CARE

01:34:52.653 --> 01:34:54.555
GIVERS SO THAT THEY CAN HELP

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:56.023
CHILDREN HE'LL NOT JUST THE

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:57.324

HOSPITALIZATION.

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:06.467
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE KNOW MORE

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:07.501

IT'S NOT CAPPED --

01:36:02.022 --> 01:36:03.657
THE FEDERAL EXPECTATION IS THAT

ARE ENTITLED TO CONDITION FOR

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:14.135
WHICH THE CHILD MEETS MEDICAL

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:16.270
NECESSITY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:18.172
IT'S CURRENTLY IN THE STATE PLAN.

01:36:18.239 --> 01:36:19.807
AND PREVENTION IS EXPLICITLY AN

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:20.608
EXPECTATION IN THE FEDERAL

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:22.009
ENTITLEMENT.

FROM HERE --

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.149
OUR FIRST RECOMMEND A DACIAN IS

01:36:28.215 --> 01:36:28.983
THE STATE CAN BE MORE

01:36:29.049 --> 01:36:30.684

ARRAY OF SERVICES.

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:35.456
THAT WE ALL EXPECT TO SEE IF

01:36:44.064 --> 01:36:45.266
THROUGH ALTERNATIVES TO

01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:46.667
HOSPITALIZATION AND WE SHOULD

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.202
THINK ABOUT WAYS TO CODIFY THOSE

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:50.371
EXPECTATIONS IN ALKHAN

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:53.440
MONITORING SYSTEMS AND PERHAPS

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:54.175
AND STATUTES AND REGULATIONS.

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:55.876
WE DESPERATELY NEED TO MODERNIZE

01:36:55.943 --> 01:36:57.178
THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:59.513
NECESSITY. ONE REASON GAUGE

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.714
MEANT RATES AND PENETRATION

01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:02.516
RATES ARE SO OUR LOW IS THAT WE

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:03.884
HAVE A DEFINITION OF MEDICAL

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:05.920
NECESSITY THAT IT'S TOO OFTEN A

01:37:05.986 --> 01:37:06.921
BAR NOT MATT.

01:37:06.987 --> 01:37:08.522
MY CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCED

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:10.224
SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA AND

01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:11.825
MODERNIZING OUR NOTIONS OF WHAT

01:37:11.892 --> 01:37:13.727
IS MEDICAL NECESSITY SO THAT WE

01:37:13.794 --> 01:37:15.029
CAN LEARN FROM DECADES OF

01:37:15.095 --> 01:37:16.564
RESEARCH ABOUT TRAUMA I THINK

01:37:16.630 --> 01:37:17.097
WOULD.

01:37:17.164 --> 01:37:18.666
WOULD EXPAND SERVICES TO A

01:37:18.732 --> 01:37:20.968
BROADER ARRAY OF OUR OF OUR

01:37:21.035 --> 01:37:22.102
POPULATION.

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:23.103
THE LEGISLATURE'S CREATED

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:25.839
BUILDING BLOCKS TO DO JUST THAT

01:37:25.906 --> 01:37:27.841
YOU PASSED AB THREE FORTY TO

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.543
REQUIRE SCREENING FOR TRAUMA FOR

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:30.244
EVERY KID.

01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:32.947
IN MEDI CAL AND YOU PASSED SB

01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:33.480
TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN AS MY

01:37:33.547 --> 01:37:34.815
COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT WHICH

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:37.084
REQUIRES THE STATE TO UPDATE THE

01:37:37.151 --> 01:37:39.053
DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY --

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:40.654
I THINK AS A STATE WE NEED TO BE

01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:42.556
MORE INTENTIONAL INTENTIONAL

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:43.891
ABOUT PROVIDING TRAINING AND

01:37:43.958 --> 01:37:45.426
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTY

01:37:45.492 --> 01:37:46.660
SOME PROVIDERS.

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:48.495
SO WE COULD TAKE THOSE EXCELLENT

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:50.231
POCKETS AND AND WHAT WE KNOW

01:37:50.297 --> 01:37:51.365
THAT WORKS.

01:37:51.432 --> 01:37:54.802
AND MAKE MAKE IT BROADLY X. AND

01:37:54.868 --> 01:37:57.104
IN FACT FULFILL THE INTENTION

01:37:57.171 --> 01:37:58.739
AND THAT'S THE SPIRIT IN THE LAW.

01:37:58.806 --> 01:38:00.040
THAT -- THAT

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:01.308
CHILDREN WHO ARE ENTITLED TO

01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:03.043
THOSE SERVICES RECEIVE THEM MY

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.111
COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT

01:38:04.178 --> 01:38:05.379
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND I

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:06.647
WON'T -- SAY

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:07.748
ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THAT HERE

01:38:07.815 --> 01:38:09.450
OTHER THAN THIS IS AN ISSUE NOT

01:38:09.516 --> 01:38:11.685
JUST ABOUT CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS.

01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:13.487
THAT IS THAT THAT IS AN AREA

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:14.088
WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:16.123
WORK FORCE BUT WE NEED TO

01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:17.191
IMPROVE THE WORK FORCE FOR PARA

01:38:17.258 --> 01:38:19.393
PROFESSIONALS PSYCHIATRIC NURSES

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:21.495
PURE PARTNERS AND OTHER

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:22.463
COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS.

01:38:22.529 --> 01:38:23.764
PERHAPS MOST SIGNIFICANTLY I

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:26.166
THINK WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB AND

01:38:26.233 --> 01:38:28.135
HOW WE USE DATA TO OVERSEE AND

01:38:28.202 --> 01:38:30.104
CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY

01:38:30.170 --> 01:38:31.405
OF OUR PROGRAMS.

01:38:31.472 --> 01:38:32.673
IN THE CHILD WELFARE PROGRAM AND

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.408
SOON IN THE COW WORKS PROGRAM WE

01:38:34.475 --> 01:38:36.243
HAVE A DATA DRIVEN OUTCOME BASED

01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:38.646
OVERSIGHT SYSTEM --

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:40.114
THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM.

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:41.615
IF WE ASK HOW DO WE KNOW HOW THE

01:38:41.682 --> 01:38:42.683
KIDS ARE DOING IN THE CHILD

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:43.651
WELFARE SYSTEM.

01:38:43.717 --> 01:38:46.186
AT ANY MOMENT YOU CAN LOG ONTO A

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:47.554

MANAGED BY UC BERKELEY AND YOU

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:52.459
CAN SEE BY QUARTER BY COUNTY.

01:38:52.526 --> 01:38:53.460
HOW KIDS IN THE CHILD WELFARE

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:55.129
SYSTEM ARE DOING ARE THEY BEING

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:57.197
REUNIFIED TIMELY ARE THEY BEING

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:58.966
REVIEW ARE THEY BEING RE ABUSED

01:38:59.033 --> 01:39:00.100
WHILE THEY'RE IN CARE?

01:39:00.167 --> 01:39:02.169
EITHER ADOPTIONS BEING PERFORMED

01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:04.038
IN A TIMELY BASIS OUR COUNTY

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:06.140
WORKERS MEETING THEIR MONTHLY

01:39:06.206 --> 01:39:07.775
VISITATION REQUIREMENTS.

01:39:07.841 --> 01:39:09.209
THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE BY

01:39:09.276 --> 01:39:10.644
COUNTY BY QUARTER IN ITS

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:12.379
STRATIFIED BY A WHOLE HOST OF

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:14.782
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS --

01:39:14.848 --> 01:39:16.583
OF OF YOUTH.

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:21.455
BOMB THAT THE AVAIL QUALITY

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:23.290
IMPROVEMENT YOU DON'T PENALIZE

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:24.958
COUNTIES YOU EXPECT THAT

01:39:25.025 --> 01:39:27.061
COUNTIES USE THAT DATA FOR SELF

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:29.063
REFLECTION AND SELF IMPROVEMENT.

01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:30.631
AND THAT CONTINUOUS GUADALUPE

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:32.533
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT APPROACH

01:39:32.599 --> 01:39:34.201
THAT'S NOT PUNITIVE --

01:39:34.268 --> 01:39:35.569
BUT BUT AS I SAID IT'S ABOUT

01:39:35.636 --> 01:39:37.371
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT I THINK

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:38.205
THERE ARE LESSONS THAT WE CAN

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:41.075
LEARN TO BUILD ON WHAT DIRECTOR

01:39:41.141 --> 01:39:42.609
CANS TALKED ABOUT AS EXISTING

01:39:42.676 --> 01:39:44.978
STATE PROGRAMS. TO BETTER USE

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:47.047
THE DATA THAT WE HAVE --

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:48.382
SOME SOME --

01:39:48.449 --> 01:39:50.050
OUTCOME MEASURES THAT WE MIGHT

01:39:50.117 --> 01:39:51.018
THINK ABOUT IMPROVE SCHOOL IN

01:39:51.085 --> 01:39:52.986
BAY AT PERFORMANCE.

01:39:53.053 --> 01:39:54.722
OUT EDUCE SUICIDE RATES FOSTER

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:56.056
CHILDREN REUNIFYING WITH THEIR

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:57.391
FAMILIES.

01:39:57.458 --> 01:39:59.526
I WOULD LIKE TO SECOND THIRD AND

01:39:59.593 --> 01:40:00.828
FOURTH THAT THE NEED FOR

01:40:00.894 --> 01:40:02.196
SIMPLIFICATION AND BILLING OUR

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:03.864
COLLEAGUES ARE SPENDING WAY TOO

01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:04.832
MUCH TIME.

01:40:04.898 --> 01:40:07.601
ON A REALLY BYZANTINE REALLY

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:08.802
UNPRODUCTIVE --

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:09.670
BILLING --

01:40:09.737 --> 01:40:11.438
BILLING SYSTEM WE NEED TO

01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:13.440
MAXIMIZE THE RECEIPT OF FEDERAL

01:40:13.507 --> 01:40:17.611
FUNDING UNDER EP STT ITS BROAD --

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:20.981
IT SUPPORTS MANY THINGS --

01:40:21.048 --> 01:40:23.484
THAT THAT MOST THINGS THAT CHOI

01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:25.085
SHOULD EXAMINE THE X. THAT --

01:40:25.152 --> 01:40:26.987
SUFFICIENCY OF FUNDING IF THERE

01:40:27.054 --> 01:40:28.555
ARE GAPS BETWEEN WHAT CHILDREN

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:30.557
NEED AND WHAT WE HAVE REASONABLY

01:40:30.624 --> 01:40:32.359
AVAILABLE THE STATE SHOULD THINK

01:40:32.426 --> 01:40:34.161
ABOUT WAYS TO WORK WITH COUNTIES

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:35.763
TO FILL IN THOSE GAPS.

01:40:35.829 --> 01:40:37.131
AND FINALLY WE NEED TO THINK

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:38.365
ABOUT RISK SHARING --

01:40:38.432 --> 01:40:40.601
IF WE SIMPLIFY BILLING AND WE DO

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:42.035
BETTER TRAINING AND TECHNICAL

01:40:42.102 --> 01:40:44.004
ASSISTANCE ON HOW TO DO BILLING

01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:45.506
AND HOW TO COMPLY WITH AUDITS IN

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:47.074
AN INCREASINGLY CAPRICIOUS

01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:50.010
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NONE THE LESS --

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:52.212
MAKES AUDIT EXCEPTIONS AND

01:40:52.279 --> 01:40:52.780
COUNTIES HAVE DONE THE RIGHT

01:40:52.846 --> 01:40:54.014
THING.

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:55.682
I'M AND WE HAVE IN GOOD FAITH

01:40:55.749 --> 01:40:57.651
DELIVERED IMPORTANT SERVICES AND

01:40:57.718 --> 01:41:00.421
WE GET INAPPROPRIATE LEADING --

01:41:00.487 --> 01:41:02.322
BY A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT HAS

01:41:02.389 --> 01:41:04.491
AN ANTI CALIFORNIA BIAS --

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:06.226
THE COUNTY SHOULD BE INDEMNIFIED

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:07.761
FROM THE RISK OF THAT IF IF IF

01:41:07.828 --> 01:41:09.797
THE EXPECTATION ON COUNTIES IS

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:11.932
BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE ABROAD IN

01:41:11.999 --> 01:41:13.267
THE RAY OF SERVICES.

01:41:13.333 --> 01:41:14.401
I MEAN REALLY STEP UP UP THE

01:41:14.468 --> 01:41:17.104
DELIVERY THE STATE REALLY NEEDS

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:18.572
TO HAVE OUR BACK --

01:41:18.639 --> 01:41:20.774
IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:23.143
ARE NOT INAPPROPRIATELY.

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:26.013
PENALIZED ON BECAUSE THAT'S

01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:26.613
FUNDING THAT COULD BE USED FOR

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.314
SERVICES.

01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:28.782
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:41:28.849 --> 01:41:30.551
THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:34.822
QUESTIONS.

01:41:34.888 --> 01:41:38.058
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS --

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:39.460
I KNOW I KNOW THAT --

01:41:39.526 --> 01:41:41.428
DEFINITION MEDICAL NECESSITY IN

01:41:41.495 --> 01:41:42.996
THE PST TEASE CAM OUT BUT QUITE

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:44.031
FREQUENTLY AND ALL YOUR

01:41:44.097 --> 01:41:44.798
TESTIMONY EVEN THE PREVIOUS

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:46.366
TESTIMONY.

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:48.635
I KNOW WE HAD SB AS A TWELVE

01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:50.504
EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH SETS A GOAL

01:41:50.571 --> 01:41:51.772
OF THE STAB WISHING YOU

01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:55.042
DEFINITIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:41:55.108 --> 01:41:56.643
IS THERE A WAY WE COULD DO THAT

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:59.613
FASTER ARE.

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:00.280
KEYS TO I MEAN I'M HERE I WILL

01:42:00.347 --> 01:42:01.248
SAY LIKE THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:02.449
SO.

01:42:02.516 --> 01:42:03.617
WHAT WE DO TO MOVE ON IT MORE

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:07.354
QUICKLY WE DID PASSED

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:09.957
LEGISLATION LAST YEAR?

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:11.024
IF I COULD I'D JUST LIKE TO

01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:11.592
CLARIFY THE SINS WERE THE

01:42:11.658 --> 01:42:13.360
SPONSORS OF THAT LEGISLATION

01:42:13.427 --> 01:42:14.061
THAT.

01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:16.463
THE GOAL OF THAT LAW WAS TO

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:17.865
ENSURE THAT STATE LAW WAS

01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:19.900
CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL LAW

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:21.335
WHICH IS.

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:24.371
ENOUGH YOU KNOW US CODE --

01:42:24.438 --> 01:42:26.273
THAT REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:27.908
ARE UPDATED TO BE CONSISTENT

01:42:27.975 --> 01:42:29.443
WITH THAT BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:31.645
EARLIER A LOT OF OUR REGULATIONS

01:42:31.712 --> 01:42:32.746
ARE VERY OLD AND CONVOLUTED AND

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:33.647
THEY ADD IN.

01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:35.382
A WHOLE LAYER OF COMPLICATION ON

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:37.351
TOP OF THE FEDERAL LAW WHICH IS

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:39.286
UNNECESSARY AND CREATES --

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:40.721
BURDEN IN ACCESSING CARE IF

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:42.189
WE'RE GONNA BROADEN IT BE ON THE

01:42:42.256 --> 01:42:44.191
FEDERAL LAW THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:46.226
BE ON THE STATE TO PAY FOR BUT I

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:48.428
YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I'M NOT

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:49.196
STANDING IN THE WAY OF THAT.

01:42:49.263 --> 01:42:50.230
PLAN.

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:51.732
OKAY SO GIVEN THE FACT WE PASS

01:42:51.798 --> 01:42:54.101
IT ON TO RECALL EXACTLY THE

01:42:54.167 --> 01:42:58.105
DETAILS I MEAN SO WHAT NGUYEN.

01:42:58.171 --> 01:42:59.106
SO I ASSUME THAT THE THE SOURCE

01:42:59.172 --> 01:42:59.640
WEEKS AWAY SOME OLD STATE

01:42:59.706 --> 01:43:01.341
REGULATIONS AND SO FORTH SO THAT

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:03.043
PLACE RIGHT NOW OR WHAT WHAT

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:04.578
WENT WENT WENT IS CHANGE GONNA

01:43:04.645 --> 01:43:05.312
HAPPEN.

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:06.613
WELL THE LAWS IN PLACE NOW RIGHT

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.215
THE REGULATIONS CAN BE

01:43:08.282 --> 01:43:10.350
ELIMINATED NOW AND WE'VE ASKED

01:43:10.417 --> 01:43:13.020
THE DIRECTOR TO DO THAT BECAUSE

01:43:13.086 --> 01:43:16.123
THE IT GIVES THEM THE AUTHORITY.

01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:17.491
I'M NOT LISTENING THE APA TO

01:43:17.558 --> 01:43:18.825
ISSUE GUIDANCE BEFORE THE

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:21.328
REGULATIONS ARE ISSUED IN TWENTY

01:43:21.395 --> 01:43:21.962
TWENTY BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:22.829
TO MENTION.

01:43:22.896 --> 01:43:24.031
SO THAT COULD BE DONE TODAY

01:43:24.097 --> 01:43:26.667
THROUGH A A GUIDANCE ALL COUNTY

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:30.537
LETTER OR MENTAL HEALTH.

01:43:30.604 --> 01:43:32.839
S. CDS LETTER SUCH.

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:33.740
YES DR I ALSO THINK THAT IN

01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:34.308
ADDITION TO MODERNIZING THE

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:35.208
DEFINITION AND REGULATIONS WE

01:43:35.275 --> 01:43:36.577
REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT

01:43:36.643 --> 01:43:37.844
TRAINING AND TECHNICAL

01:43:37.911 --> 01:43:40.547
ASSISTANCE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A

01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:42.282
SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A

01:43:42.349 --> 01:43:43.784
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF VARIATION

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:45.285
ABOUT WHETHER A SIMILARLY

01:43:45.352 --> 01:43:46.553
PRESENTING CHILD.

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.221
WOULD MEET MEDICAL NECESSITY IN

01:43:48.288 --> 01:43:50.123
ONE COUNTY AS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER

01:43:50.190 --> 01:43:50.357
COUNTY.

01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:52.826
AND SO THAT'S NOT BECAUSE

01:43:52.893 --> 01:43:54.595
COUNTIES DON'T WANT TO SERVE

01:43:54.661 --> 01:43:57.798
KIDS -- IT'S

01:43:57.864 --> 01:44:00.200
DEFINITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN THAT

01:44:00.267 --> 01:44:01.768
WE NEED TO BE INTENTIONAL AS A

01:44:01.835 --> 01:44:03.804
STATE WITH A COUNTIES IN

01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:06.106

01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:41.201
SO IT'S REALLY THAT PIPELINE

01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:42.536
APPROACH THAT YOU KNOW

01:45:42.602 --> 01:45:44.004

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:04.958
MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH AS ALSO

WHEN WE LOOK AT RESIDENCY SLOTS

01:46:06.593 --> 01:46:07.828
I KNOW THAT THOSE CAN BE LIMITED

01:46:07.894 --> 01:46:08.995
IN TRAINING SLOTS FOR ALL TYPES

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:10.097
OF DIFFERENT PROFESSIONALS WE

01:46:10.163 --> 01:46:11.698

TIED UP IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

01:47:13.727 --> 01:47:15.896
THAT THERE I THINK THE FROM --

01:47:15.962 --> 01:47:17.931
MISS LARSEN WE HEARD THAT --

01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:19.966

AND SO NOW YOU'RE ONLY HOW THESE

01:47:32.546 --> 01:47:34.114
KINDS OF THINGS ARE EXTREMELY

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:36.416
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING --

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:39.319

01:47:52.399 --> 01:47:54.534
THAT ARE CRITICAL AND AND AND

01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:55.602
WHAT CAUGHT ME WILK WHAT I

01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:57.370
WONDERED AS WE START LOOKING

01:47:57.437 --> 01:47:58.705
SOMEWHERE BACKGROUND INFORMATION

01:47:58.772 --> 01:47:59.773
WITH MISTER MECCA WE TALKED UP

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:02.275
PENETRATION ENGAGEMENT RATES ON

THEIR THEIR LOW --

01:48:06.947 --> 01:48:08.782
BUT THEIR DECLINING.

01:48:08.849 --> 01:48:10.083
SO WHY ARE THEY DECLINE THERE

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:12.385
ARE THERE LOW IN THEIR DECLINING

01:48:12.452 --> 01:48:14.020
FURTHER WIRE THEY DECLINING --

01:48:14.087 --> 01:48:14.588
I DON'T HAVE THE DEFINITIVE

01:48:14.654 --> 01:48:15.422
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WE'VE

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:18.258
HEARD THAT THAT TO SOME DEGREE --

01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:20.093
CHILDREN ARE BEING SERVED --

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.761
BY PROP SIXTY THREE SO CONNIE'S

01:48:21.828 --> 01:48:23.363
COUNTIES ARE USING MENTAL HEALTH

01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:25.098
SERVICES ACT MONEY --

01:48:25.165 --> 01:48:28.001
AND NOT E. PST T. --

01:48:28.068 --> 01:48:30.570
I DON'T KNOW HOW SORT OF WIDELY

01:48:30.637 --> 01:48:34.241
THAT IS THE CASE --

01:48:34.307 --> 01:48:36.009
BUT IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY --

01:48:36.076 --> 01:48:38.178
TROUBLING PHENOMENON.

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:39.412
SO THE BEES SO YOU SO YOUR YOUR

01:48:39.479 --> 01:48:41.548
FEELINGS ARE BEING POTENTIALLY

01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:44.050
BEING SERVICE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:48:44.117 --> 01:48:45.919
THE INCIDENCES IT ISN'T GOING

01:48:45.986 --> 01:48:46.887
AWAY RIGHT AND I DO I DO THINK

01:48:46.953 --> 01:48:49.089
IT GETS TO TRYING TO FIND

01:48:49.155 --> 01:48:52.058
STRATEGIES. TO MAKE MORE.

01:48:52.125 --> 01:48:54.361
CONSISTENT ACROSS COUNTIES WHEN

01:48:54.427 --> 01:48:56.529
CAN USE THE PST IF YOU.

01:48:56.596 --> 01:48:59.032
IF YOU PRESENTED CHILD TO

01:48:59.099 --> 01:49:01.201
EXCELLENT COUNTY ADMINISTRATORS

01:49:01.268 --> 01:49:04.537
IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH --

01:49:04.604 --> 01:49:07.474
YOU MIGHT GET DIFFERENT MEDICAL

01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:09.209
NECESSITY FOR PARTICULARLY PST

01:49:09.276 --> 01:49:11.745
T. SERVICE --

01:49:11.811 --> 01:49:14.848
AND IT'S IT'S NOT A SIMPLE THING

01:49:14.915 --> 01:49:16.549
AND I DON'T THINK THE GUIDANCE

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:18.285
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

01:49:18.351 --> 01:49:21.821
BEEN PARTICULARLY CLEAR --

01:49:21.888 --> 01:49:23.256
BUT THAT ENTITLEMENT IS

01:49:23.323 --> 01:49:24.824
EXTREMELY BROAD.

01:49:24.891 --> 01:49:26.660
AND I DO THINK WE HAVE A SICK WE

01:49:26.726 --> 01:49:28.862
HAVE A TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY TO

01:49:28.929 --> 01:49:30.330
WORK TOGETHER TO SAY WHAT DO.

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:32.399
WHAT DO WE IN CALIFORNIA BELIEVE

01:49:32.465 --> 01:49:34.401
HE PST T. REQUIRES AND IF WE

01:49:34.467 --> 01:49:36.069
DON'T SEE THIS SET OF SERVICES

01:49:36.136 --> 01:49:37.871
EVERYWHERE WE GO?

01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:40.040
AND IF A CHILD IN. TO HIM --

01:49:40.106 --> 01:49:41.708
AND THEN A CHILD IN KERN WHO

01:49:41.775 --> 01:49:43.710
KIND OF PRESENT IN THE SAME WAY

01:49:43.777 --> 01:49:44.945
WE GET.

01:49:45.011 --> 01:49:47.447
YOU KNOW REASONABLY SORT OF CALM

01:49:47.514 --> 01:49:50.850
AND DIAGNOSIS IN THE DEFINITION

01:49:50.917 --> 01:49:52.118
OF MEDICAL NECESSITY IN WHAT

01:49:52.185 --> 01:49:53.353
WHAT SHOULD THEY GET THERE'S A

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.088
LOT OF ROOM I THINK --

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:56.323
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTIES

01:49:56.389 --> 01:49:57.524
IN THE STATE TO IMPROVE

01:49:57.590 --> 01:50:00.827
CONSISTENCY AND TO BROADEN --

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:02.462
ACCESS TO THE ENTITLEMENT AND TO

01:50:02.529 --> 01:50:04.597
THE EXTENT THAT THE FEAR FEDERAL

01:50:04.664 --> 01:50:06.499
AUDITS IS --

01:50:06.566 --> 01:50:09.436
A CONCERN ABOUT YOU KNOW.

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:10.737
WE WANT TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE BUT

01:50:10.804 --> 01:50:12.772
WHAT HAPPENS IF I HAVE TO SET

01:50:12.839 --> 01:50:14.474
ASIDE A MILLION DOLLARS IN MY

01:50:14.541 --> 01:50:16.843
BUDGET JUST BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING

01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:18.378
I'M GONNA GET AUDIT EXCEPTIONS --

01:50:18.445 --> 01:50:19.980
WE DO HAVE TO WORK WITH OUR

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:21.681
FEDERAL PARTNERS --

01:50:21.748 --> 01:50:23.216
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:24.818
BELIEVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:50:24.884 --> 01:50:27.554
CHILDREN SHOULD BE GETTING STUFF --

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:30.423
AND THAT THE PST T. ON THE CLAIM

01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:32.258
AT AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:50:32.325 --> 01:50:33.960
SAYS AFTER THE FACT SOMETIMES

01:50:34.027 --> 01:50:35.362
MANY YEARS AFTER THE FACT NO

01:50:35.428 --> 01:50:36.496
SORRY.

01:50:36.563 --> 01:50:38.732
YOU SHOULD HAVE CLAIM THAT --

01:50:38.798 --> 01:50:41.301
THE STATE NEEDS TO SHARE RISK

01:50:41.368 --> 01:50:41.568
WITH US --

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:42.736
FOR DOING SO.

01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:44.604
JUST ONE THING I WOULD ADD TO

01:50:44.671 --> 01:50:46.373
WHAT FRANK SAID IS THAT YOU KNOW

01:50:46.439 --> 01:50:48.041
THERE'S VERY INCONSISTENT --

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:50.777
PRACTICES AMONG COUNTIES NUND

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:51.344
THE INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN

01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:53.046
SERVICES FROM THE REALIGNMENT

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:54.714
DOLLARS USE FOR CHILDREN AND FOR

01:50:54.781 --> 01:50:57.017
ADULTS SOME MORE PLACES MORE

01:50:57.083 --> 01:50:58.218
MONIES GOING TO ADULTS IF YOU

01:50:58.284 --> 01:50:59.486
LOOK AT THE AMOUNT SPENT PER

01:50:59.552 --> 01:51:01.221
CHILD IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IN

01:51:01.287 --> 01:51:02.188
DIFFERENT PLACES DIFFERENT

01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:03.223
COUNTY SO.

01:51:03.289 --> 01:51:04.724
I THINK THAT INVESTMENT IS AN

01:51:04.791 --> 01:51:06.026
ISSUE AND NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.193
IT SHOULD BE.

01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:08.294
YOU KNOW BECAUSE A REALIGNMENT

01:51:08.361 --> 01:51:09.629
THERE'S A SENSE THAT THESE ARE

01:51:09.696 --> 01:51:10.997
THE COUNTY DOLLARS THAT THEY

01:51:11.064 --> 01:51:12.232
NEED TO PROTECTIONS FOR SO THAT

01:51:12.298 --> 01:51:13.333
THEY DON'T RUN OUT.

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:15.301
AND THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S A

01:51:15.368 --> 01:51:17.470
BIT AT THERE'S TRIAGE BEING OF

01:51:17.537 --> 01:51:19.105
OF DELIVERY OF SERVICES

01:51:19.172 --> 01:51:20.106
INCLUDING TWO CHILDREN

01:51:20.173 --> 01:51:21.508
REGARDLESS THE ENTITLEMENT IN

01:51:21.574 --> 01:51:23.143
THE REGARDLESS THAT YOU COULD

01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:24.377
GET ADDITIONAL FUNDS.

01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:26.446
BEYOND THE CAPITATE YOU KNOW

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:27.447
BEYOND WHAT'S PROVIDES A

01:51:27.514 --> 01:51:28.915
REALIGNMENT IF YOU NEEDED IT

01:51:28.982 --> 01:51:31.584
JUST THAT THERE'S A PROCESS TO

01:51:31.651 --> 01:51:32.185
DO THAT AND I THINK A LOT OF

01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:35.789
COUNTIES JUST. TO HOLD ON TO

01:51:35.855 --> 01:51:39.626

EXCEPT AS THINGS THAT ARE REALLY

01:51:41.628 --> 01:51:42.896
BROADER ARE A POTENTIALLY

01:51:42.962 --> 01:51:44.798
OBVIOUSLY IT TO IT A DOUBLE EDGE

01:51:44.864 --> 01:51:47.267
SWORD AND AND THAT WELL I DON'T.

01:51:47.333 --> 01:51:48.101
WANT.

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:51.171
TO BOX PEOPLE IN.

01:51:51.237 --> 01:51:53.006

SORRY NO NO THAT'S OKAY.

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:09.689
I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION AND

01:52:09.756 --> 01:52:10.457
THIS IS JUST BASED ON A PERSONAL

01:52:10.523 --> 01:52:11.691
EXPERIENCE AND I'M JUST CURIOUS

01:52:11.758 --> 01:52:12.892
TO SEE A FONG.

01:52:12.959 --> 01:52:13.827
IF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION --

01:52:13.893 --> 01:52:15.095
YOU KNOW I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER

01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:17.263
THAT THERE IS A LACK OF SERVICES --

01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:18.832
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES UNDER THE

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:21.768
AGE OF EIGHT SO I USED TO HAVE A

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:22.936
STUDENT WHO YOU WHO WAS

01:52:23.002 --> 01:52:25.071
SCHIZOPHRENIC BASED ON WHAT

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:26.706
EVERYONE WAS TELLING ME BUT SHE

01:52:26.773 --> 01:52:27.874
WAS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE WERE I

01:52:27.941 --> 01:52:29.542
WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG

01:52:29.609 --> 01:52:32.112
TO BE DIAGNOSED AND AND QUALIFY

01:52:32.178 --> 01:52:33.546
FOR SERVICES --

01:52:33.613 --> 01:52:35.615
CAN YOU TELL ME STILL AGE IS A

01:52:35.682 --> 01:52:37.217
OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR AGE IS

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:38.785
STORED ISSUE AS IT PERTAINS TO

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:40.887
DIAGNOSIS AND GETTING THOSE

01:52:40.954 --> 01:52:46.526
SERVICES.

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:47.894
I MEAN I CAN TELL YOU FROM

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:49.395
EXPERIENCE THAT I MEAN THERE ARE

01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:50.897
CLINICIANS IN THE AUDIENCE I'M

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:52.098
SURE THEY CAN ANSWER THIS BUT I

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:53.967
HAVE NOT SEEN A LIMITATION OF

01:52:54.033 --> 01:52:55.702
AGE BEING A BASIS FOR NOT GIVING

01:52:55.768 --> 01:52:57.804
IT DIAGNOSIS I'VE SEEN IT AT AGE

01:52:57.871 --> 01:52:59.439
THREE I'VE SEEN IT MANY AGES.

01:52:59.506 --> 01:53:01.307
SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT ALONE

01:53:01.374 --> 01:53:03.810
IS A CRITERIA FOR NOT SERVING A

01:53:03.877 --> 01:53:05.245
CHILD NO MATTER WHAT THE AGE.

01:53:05.311 --> 01:53:06.446
HOWEVER I'M I'M SURE THAT THERE

01:53:06.513 --> 01:53:07.814
ARE CLINICAL FACTORS IN WHICH

01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:08.848
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE

01:53:08.915 --> 01:53:10.683
UNNECESSARILY OR INAPPROPRIATELY

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:12.986
A DIAGNOSIS AT A EARLY AGE UNTIL

01:53:13.052 --> 01:53:14.754
YOU HAVE ENOUGH.

01:53:14.821 --> 01:53:18.057
EVIDENCE THAT THEY MEET THE DS

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:19.926
I'M PREGNANT CRITERIA FOR THAT

01:53:19.993 --> 01:53:21.528
PARTICULAR DIAGNOSIS BUT THERE

01:53:21.594 --> 01:53:23.596

OF THING.

01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:30.436
WHICH IS BASED ON THE

01:53:30.503 --> 01:53:31.037
INFORMATION YOU SEE THAT THE

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:33.106
TIME THEY SAID SHE WAS TOO YOUNG

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:35.241
TO BE DIAGNOSED THAT SOMETIMES

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:36.976
THEY BELIEVE IT'S BEHAVIORS THAT

01:53:37.043 --> 01:53:38.578
KIDS GROW OUT OF FUND WE WERE

01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:39.679

01:53:39.746 --> 01:53:40.380

BUT SHE COULDN'T GET SERVICES

01:53:42.215 --> 01:53:43.750

01:56:58.978 --> 01:57:01.114
WHY AREN'T MORE FQHCS PROVIDING

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:02.715
CARE IN THE SYSTEM SO I'D LIKE

01:57:02.782 --> 01:57:03.983
TO SHARE THAT THERE'S NOT MANY

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.785
FQHCS THAT ARE PROVIDING THIS

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:07.620
LEVEL OF CARE IN THE COMMUNITY?

AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE OF THREE

01:57:08.921 --> 01:57:10.590
TOP REASONS WHY --

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:12.592
FIRST AS I MENTIONED AND IF

01:57:12.658 --> 01:57:13.993
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH FQHCS WE

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:15.928

COMPREHENSIVE PERINATAL SERVICES.

01:57:19.298 --> 01:57:20.833
AND IT'S A HUGE BENEFIT FOR OUR

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:23.202
COMMUNITY AND OUR CLIENTS.

01:57:23.269 --> 01:57:24.170
UNFORTUNATELY --

01:57:24.237 --> 01:57:25.104
AND THERE'S BEEN ALSO LOTS OF

01:57:25.171 --> 01:57:26.739
CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT THE

01:57:26.806 --> 01:57:28.174
BENEFITS OF INNER --

01:57:28.241 --> 01:57:29.909
WOVEN OF PRIMARY CARE WITH

01:57:29.976 --> 01:57:31.644
SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH

01:57:31.711 --> 01:57:32.845
SERVICES AND WHAT HAVE

01:57:32.912 --> 01:57:34.313
BENEFITTED IS THE PATIENTS ARE

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:35.381
ACCESSING CARE.

01:57:35.448 --> 01:57:37.784
UNFORTUNATELY FOR OF TO WHICH

01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:40.353
YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN AS MODELS

01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:42.088

01:57:42.155 --> 01:57:43.156
TAKEN THE POSITION THAT IN ORDER

01:57:43.222 --> 01:57:44.724
FOR FQHCS TO PROVIDE THIS CARE

01:57:44.791 --> 01:57:45.925
WE HAVE TO COMPLETELY.

01:57:45.992 --> 01:57:48.795
SILO THE FQHC SIDE AND THE

01:57:48.861 --> 01:57:49.996
SUBSTANCE USE AND SPECIAL TO

01:57:50.062 --> 01:57:51.130
MENTAL HEALTH SIDE --

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:52.432
WHICH REALLY IS IN DIRECT

01:57:52.498 --> 01:57:53.866
CONTRAST WITH SOME OF THE WORK

01:57:53.933 --> 01:57:55.101
THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

01:57:55.168 --> 01:57:56.335
ACHIEVE AND THE AND THE MOVE

01:57:56.402 --> 01:57:57.270
THAT WE'RE TRYING.

01:57:57.336 --> 01:57:58.671
TO MOVE FORWARD AND THE SECOND

01:57:58.738 --> 01:58:00.072
PIECE AND I THINK THIS IS I'M

01:58:00.139 --> 01:58:01.174
JUST ECHOING WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:02.742
SAID IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND

01:58:02.809 --> 01:58:05.178
DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:06.145
SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:58:06.212 --> 01:58:08.114
DRUG MEDI CAL OR PRETTY ONEROUS.

01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:09.949
BURDEN SOME HAVING BILL THEM

01:58:10.016 --> 01:58:10.616
MYSELF -- IT

AT OUR HEALTH CENTER IN SPECIAL

01:58:12.552 --> 01:58:14.387
TO MENTAL HEALTH ON AVERAGE

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:16.823
CLINICIANS SPEND 40% OF THEIR

01:58:16.889 --> 01:58:18.558

01:58:18.624 --> 01:58:19.692

01:58:19.759 --> 01:58:21.727
SPENT 40% OF THEIR TIME MANAGING

01:58:21.794 --> 01:58:23.062
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND

01:58:23.129 --> 01:58:25.231
DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS OF CARE

01:58:25.298 --> 01:58:26.566
AND THAT'S NOT INCLUDING THE

01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:28.000
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF MANAGED

01:58:28.067 --> 01:58:29.735
JUST ALLOWANCES AND AND THE

01:58:29.802 --> 01:58:31.137
DOCUMENTATION ITSELF SO.

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:32.472
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IN

01:58:32.538 --> 01:58:33.673
CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAVEN'T

01:58:33.739 --> 01:58:35.308
ACCESS TO CARE ISSUE FOR MENTAL

01:58:35.374 --> 01:58:37.043

QUALIFIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

01:58:39.178 --> 01:58:41.314

TIME IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CARE.

01:58:51.624 --> 01:58:53.826
WE ALSO HAVE A HUGE WORKFORCE

01:58:53.893 --> 01:58:55.361
CHALLENGE IN FIELD OF BEHAVIORAL

01:58:55.428 --> 01:58:57.730
HEALTH AND THE NUMBER ONE REASON

01:58:57.797 --> 01:58:59.799
I HEAR A CLINICIAN THAT WANTS TO

01:58:59.866 --> 01:59:00.666
BE TRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT

01:59:00.733 --> 01:59:01.167
DEPARTMENT.

01:59:01.234 --> 01:59:04.837
OR TO LEAVE A NONPROFIT WORKING

01:59:04.904 --> 01:59:09.141
TIME STAND MORE QUALIFIED MENTAL

01:59:10.643 --> 01:59:11.878
ESPECIALLY TRAGIC TO LOSE AND

01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:12.879
THE PAPERWORK.

01:59:12.945 --> 01:59:14.347
AND LASTLY ONE OF THE ON GOING

01:59:14.413 --> 01:59:16.449
CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS IN ORDER

01:59:16.516 --> 01:59:18.217
FOR US TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE

01:59:18.284 --> 01:59:19.185
COUNTY --

01:59:19.252 --> 01:59:20.786
FUNDED A CARVE OUT PROGRAMS IS

01:59:20.853 --> 01:59:22.088
WE HAVE TO HAVE A CONTRACT WITH

01:59:22.154 --> 01:59:23.923
THE COUNTY AND WE'RE LUCKY TO

01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:26.659
HAVE ONE AND WE HAVE TO THEN RE

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:27.960
APPLY THROUGH A COMPETITIVE BRED

01:59:28.027 --> 01:59:30.363
PROCESS EVERY THREE YEARS.

01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:31.964
IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE

CAN IMAGINE THAT MAKES IT

01:59:36.469 --> 01:59:38.471
EXTREMELY CHALLENGING TO BUILD

01:59:38.538 --> 01:59:40.106

01:59:40.172 --> 01:59:42.008
ONE EVERY THREE YEARS YEARS IT

01:59:42.074 --> 01:59:43.342
COULD ESSENTIALLY RESET.

01:59:43.409 --> 01:59:44.944
SO FOR THOSE REASONS --

01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:46.145
MANY OF COMMITTEES ARE NOT

01:59:46.212 --> 01:59:47.847

SETTING TO TO RECEIVE CARE.

02:00:04.897 --> 02:00:05.731
A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE IN

02:00:05.798 --> 02:00:07.166
RESPONSE TO THAT IS --

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:07.500
ONE IS -- TO

02:00:07.567 --> 02:00:08.935
LOOK CAN THIS IS NOT NEW BUT

02:00:09.001 --> 02:00:11.037
LOOK AT THE BIFURCATED SYSTEM

02:00:11.103 --> 02:00:13.272
AND A SIMPLIFIED TO ONE SOURCE

02:00:13.339 --> 02:00:14.974

AND SECOND TO LOOK AT MORE

02:00:20.379 --> 02:00:21.981
INNOVATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES

02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:24.050
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE

02:00:24.116 --> 02:00:25.718
INTEGRATION WITH PRIMARY CARE AN

02:00:25.785 --> 02:00:27.053
FQHC SETTING SO THAT WOULD BE.

02:00:27.119 --> 02:00:28.721
VALUE BASED PAYMENTS OR PAPER

02:00:28.788 --> 02:00:30.656

02:00:30.723 --> 02:00:32.358

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:51.524
SO WHAT'S WORKED WELL WITH THIS

02:03:51.590 --> 02:03:52.992
ARRANGEMENT --

02:03:53.058 --> 02:03:53.993

ON WHOLE PERSON CARE.

02:04:10.509 --> 02:04:11.911
I THINK THE KIND OF ISSUES THAT

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:13.679

02:04:13.746 --> 02:04:14.747

ISSUES WE FIGURE OUT THE PAYMENT

02:04:16.715 --> 02:04:18.918
LATER BUT AT CLIENT IS IN OUR A

02:04:18.984 --> 02:04:20.252
MEMBER IS NEVER FAR FROM ANY

02:04:20.319 --> 02:04:22.888
SERVICE ON BECAUSE IT'S IT MIGHT

02:04:22.955 --> 02:04:23.522
BE YOU KNOW.

02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:27.660
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT SYSTEM THAT

02:04:27.726 --> 02:04:31.397
SERVICE THOSE --

02:04:31.463 --> 02:04:33.532
IS UNDER ONE AND HE IS ALL IS

02:04:33.599 --> 02:04:35.935
REALLY HELPFUL SO PHARMACY PART

02:04:36.001 --> 02:04:38.037
D. FOR EXAMPLE IS --

02:04:38.103 --> 02:04:39.738
UNDER OUR RESPONSIBILITY HEALTH

02:04:39.805 --> 02:04:41.073
PLANS RESPONSIBILITY.

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:42.541
I'LL JUST GIVING EXAMPLES

02:04:42.608 --> 02:04:43.976
SEVERAL YEARS AGO --

02:04:44.043 --> 02:04:45.578
WE HAD A MEMBER WHO

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:47.847
UNFORTUNATELY LOST ON ENROLLMENT

02:04:47.913 --> 02:04:49.682
WITH US BECAUSE I HE HAD LOST

02:04:49.748 --> 02:04:50.716
HIS --

02:04:50.783 --> 02:04:52.351
MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY FOR A SHORT

02:04:52.418 --> 02:04:54.453
TIME HE WAS RE ENROLLED IN

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.622
ANOTHER PART DEEP PLAN HE HAD

02:04:56.689 --> 02:04:58.390
TROUBLE GETTING HIS MEDICATIONS.

02:04:58.457 --> 02:05:00.159
WHY HE ENDED UP --

02:05:00.226 --> 02:05:02.561
HAVING UP UP UP PSYCHOTIC BREAK

02:05:02.628 --> 02:05:04.263
AND HE WAS SHOT DEAD BY THE

02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:05.931
POLICE IN FRONT OF THIS --

02:05:05.998 --> 02:05:07.466
ON FRONT OF HIS HOME BECAUSE YOU

02:05:07.533 --> 02:05:09.335
SPREADING FAMILY MEMBERS OF

02:05:09.401 --> 02:05:10.269
POLICE WITH THAT WITH A KNIFE.

02:05:10.336 --> 02:05:11.170
SO I MEAN IT'S THE MEDICATION

02:05:11.237 --> 02:05:15.107
PIECES SO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE

02:05:15.174 --> 02:05:17.610
WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL --

02:05:17.676 --> 02:05:18.677
WERE ALSO THE FOR STRUGGLE

02:05:18.744 --> 02:05:19.345
REASONS WITH THE ONLY PLAN THAT

02:05:19.411 --> 02:05:21.380
HAS MEDICAID MENTAL HEALTH DRUGS

02:05:21.447 --> 02:05:22.748
CARVE DâN ON TO OUR PLAN AND

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:25.451
THAT IS WORK JUST EXTREMELY WELL

02:05:25.517 --> 02:05:27.086
ON AT A LOCAL LEVEL.

02:05:27.152 --> 02:05:28.387
ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT SCHOOL

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:29.121
WHAT'S WORKED WELL WITH THE

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:30.656
DOLE'S DEMO IS THAT THERE ARE

02:05:30.723 --> 02:05:32.358
SHARED OUTCOME GOALS AND SHARED

02:05:32.424 --> 02:05:33.325
SAVINGS AVAILABLE IN THAT

02:05:33.392 --> 02:05:34.660
PROGRAM IN A SMALL WAY.

02:05:34.727 --> 02:05:36.495
SO -- WE

02:05:36.562 --> 02:05:37.529
HAVE WORKED TOGETHER WITH

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:40.332
BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND WE SUCCEED

02:05:40.399 --> 02:05:41.400
THE CALL CALL YOU WITHHOLD

MEASURES PAID BACK AND WE'VE

02:05:42.534 --> 02:05:46.205
SHARED THE US SAVINGS WITH --

02:05:46.272 --> 02:05:46.805
OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH DEPARTMENT

02:05:46.872 --> 02:05:47.406
AND I CAN.

02:05:47.473 --> 02:05:48.874
I INTEREST OF TIME I CAN ANSWER

02:05:48.941 --> 02:05:50.442
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT LATER IF

02:05:50.509 --> 02:05:51.944
YOU'RE INTERESTED --

02:05:52.011 --> 02:05:52.978
WE'VE DONE --

02:05:53.045 --> 02:05:54.480
A LOT OF INFORMATION SHARING WE

02:05:54.546 --> 02:05:56.582
SHARE CARE PLANS AND I THINK WE

02:05:56.649 --> 02:05:58.517
DO A GOOD JOB YOU CAN ALWAYS BE

02:05:58.584 --> 02:06:00.419
IMPROVED AROUND JOINT CARE

02:06:00.486 --> 02:06:01.720
COORDINATION OF OUR OUR FOR A

02:06:01.787 --> 02:06:02.855
JOINT MEMBERS.

02:06:02.922 --> 02:06:04.356
SO WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.

02:06:04.423 --> 02:06:05.758
WELL FRANKLY IN THIS IS

02:06:05.824 --> 02:06:07.059
FOLLOWING UP AND DIRECTOR CANS

02:06:07.126 --> 02:06:09.395
COMMENTS ARE COUNTY AND I DON'T

02:06:09.461 --> 02:06:11.497
THINK IT'S UNUSUAL IS NOT GOOD

02:06:11.563 --> 02:06:12.932
AT PLAN --

02:06:12.998 --> 02:06:14.266
ADMINISTRATIVE BUSINESS

02:06:14.333 --> 02:06:17.503
FUNCTIONS SO COMPLIANCE NETWORK

02:06:17.569 --> 02:06:18.904
MANAGING IN CONTRACTING.

02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:20.940
UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT ALSO NEED

02:06:21.006 --> 02:06:24.109
SOME WORK CLAIMS PAYMENT A CALL

02:06:24.176 --> 02:06:25.878
CENTER GRIEVANCE AN APPEALS

02:06:25.945 --> 02:06:28.180
REPORTING TO THE STATE AND AND

02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:29.848
FEDERAL REGULATORS ON QUALITY

02:06:29.915 --> 02:06:30.816
REPORTING.

02:06:30.883 --> 02:06:35.921
I THINK THE PLANS ON GENERALLY I

02:06:35.988 --> 02:06:37.790
MEAN -- IT'S

02:06:37.856 --> 02:06:38.958
SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO THAT WERE

02:06:39.024 --> 02:06:40.125
BETTER AT THAT.

02:06:40.192 --> 02:06:41.827
WE WE'D DELEGATED A LOT OF THOSE

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:42.461
FUNCTIONS TO OUR COUNTY PARTNER

02:06:42.528 --> 02:06:43.529
WHEN WE DELEGATED SOME OF THESE

02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:44.196
PROGRAMS.

02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:46.065
AND NOW WE'RE WE THINKING THAT --

02:06:46.131 --> 02:06:48.801
IS SO DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO

02:06:48.867 --> 02:06:51.403
ADMINISTRATIVE --

02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:54.873
TIME SUCK AND SO --

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:55.841
AND IT'S SIX INCREASINGLY

02:06:55.908 --> 02:06:57.009
CHALLENGING AS DIRECTOR KANSEN

02:06:57.076 --> 02:06:58.344
WITH THE NEW FEDERAL ON MEDIC

02:06:58.410 --> 02:07:01.146
MEDICAID MANAGED CARE RULE.

02:07:01.213 --> 02:07:03.849
SO OUR GOAL IS TO BOMB ACOSTA

02:07:03.916 --> 02:07:04.817
JOINT CALL WITH THE COUNTY

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:06.418
HEALTH LEADERSHIP IS TO DEVELOP

02:07:06.485 --> 02:07:07.386
A STRUCTURE WHERE THE HEALTH

02:07:07.453 --> 02:07:08.988
PLAN REALLY CANDLES MOST THE

02:07:09.054 --> 02:07:11.390
PLAN FUNCTIONS ACROSS ALL

02:07:11.457 --> 02:07:13.192
PROGRAM SO IT'S NOT JUST.

02:07:13.258 --> 02:07:14.960
THE PROGRAMS ARE RESPONSIBLE ONE

02:07:15.027 --> 02:07:16.095
WOULD ALSO SERIOUSLY AT THE

02:07:16.161 --> 02:07:16.962
CARVE OUT PROGRAM TO TO THE

02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:18.864
EXTENT WE CAN UNDER THE CURRENT

02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:20.532
ARRANGEMENT --

02:07:20.599 --> 02:07:21.600
AND THAT THE THE COUNTY BEAVER

02:07:21.667 --> 02:07:22.601
HEALTH DEPARTMENT REALLY FOCUS

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:24.503
ON PROVIDING SERVICE SERVICES

02:07:24.570 --> 02:07:25.838
AND WHAT THEY DO BEST SO FOR

02:07:25.904 --> 02:07:27.039
EXAMPLE.

02:07:27.106 --> 02:07:28.741
WE WOULD RUN A CALL CENTER WE

02:07:28.807 --> 02:07:30.776
WOULD COLLATE COLOCATED APRIL

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:33.145
STAFF AT THE CALL CENTER.

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:36.849
AND AND DIAL IT DOWN IN WE WE

02:07:36.915 --> 02:07:38.017
HAD WAS TO HAVE A MUCH MORE

02:07:38.083 --> 02:07:39.318
SOPHISTICATED CALL CENTER THAN

02:07:39.385 --> 02:07:39.852
ANYTHING IF THEY CAN DO.

02:07:39.918 --> 02:07:45.858
SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE WHAT

02:07:45.924 --> 02:07:48.694
WE MIGHT DO --

02:07:48.761 --> 02:07:49.661
AND OUR GOAL IS THEN TO

02:07:49.728 --> 02:07:50.996
INTEGRATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

02:07:51.063 --> 02:07:51.597
UNDER THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK.

02:07:51.663 --> 02:07:52.598
SO MY ADVICE FOR THE STATE --

02:07:52.664 --> 02:07:54.266
BASED ON OUR LOCAL EXPERIENCES

02:07:54.333 --> 02:07:54.633
FIRST OF ALL --

02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:55.901
WE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE

02:07:55.968 --> 02:07:59.304
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE RECENT

02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:00.773
REFERENCE IT'S CALLED A

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:01.306
BLUEPRINT.

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:02.875
ON WHICH CALLS FOR INTEGRATION

02:08:02.941 --> 02:08:05.277
OF OF PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR HEALTH

02:08:05.344 --> 02:08:07.212
AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES UNDER

02:08:07.279 --> 02:08:08.180
ONE ENTITY.

02:08:08.247 --> 02:08:10.149
BUT WE HAVE TO BE DONE REALLY

02:08:10.215 --> 02:08:11.817
SLOWLY IT HAS TO BE DONE --

02:08:11.884 --> 02:08:14.253
THROUGH A PHASE AND PROCESS SOME

02:08:14.319 --> 02:08:16.989
COUNTIES ARE MORE READY TO DO

02:08:17.056 --> 02:08:18.490
JACK ANOTHER'S COUNTIES AND SOME

02:08:18.557 --> 02:08:20.659
PLANS I'M ALREADY DO THAT AND

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:21.960
OTHER PLANTS.

02:08:22.027 --> 02:08:23.729
I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO EXPAND

02:08:23.796 --> 02:08:24.596
MAINTAIN AND EXPAND THE DOLES

02:08:24.663 --> 02:08:26.899
DEMONSTRATION BECAUSE AGAIN THE

02:08:26.965 --> 02:08:28.133
MOST COMPLEX BEHAVIOR ALL

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:30.736
CLIENTS ARE DOUBLES AND SO WE

02:08:30.803 --> 02:08:32.204
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:08:32.271 --> 02:08:34.239
COVERING THEM AS WELL AND THAT

02:08:34.306 --> 02:08:34.440
WORK.

02:08:34.506 --> 02:08:35.374
WE WE HAVE SOME LOCAL CONTROL

02:08:35.441 --> 02:08:38.410
OVER THE PHARMACY PARTY BENEFITS.

02:08:38.477 --> 02:08:39.044
AND THEN --

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:40.345
I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW I KNOW

02:08:40.412 --> 02:08:42.114
THAT MOST OF MENTAL HEALTH

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:43.549
PHARMACY --

02:08:43.615 --> 02:08:45.584
IS CARVED OUT NOW THE MOST

02:08:45.651 --> 02:08:48.020
NEARLY ALL THE PLANTS BUT I NEED

02:08:48.087 --> 02:08:50.956

BE WHICH IS SORT OF THE BECAUSE

02:08:54.493 --> 02:08:56.895
AGAIN MEDICATIONS ARTS SO KEYED

02:08:56.962 --> 02:08:57.996

OF MENTALLY ILL AND NOT

02:08:59.932 --> 02:09:02.367
SUBSTANCE AND CLIENTS WITH

02:09:02.434 --> 02:09:03.869
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS.

MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES HAVE

02:10:01.126 --> 02:10:02.928

02:10:34.326 --> 02:10:36.929
CONTINUE.

02:10:36.995 --> 02:10:38.030
SO WE'VE EXPERIENCED STRONG

02:10:38.096 --> 02:10:39.231
COLLABORATION WITH

02:10:39.298 --> 02:10:41.066

02:10:48.507 --> 02:10:50.042
BUT THE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS OF

02:10:50.108 --> 02:10:51.009
LIP SPLITTING THE SYSTEM BASED

02:10:51.076 --> 02:10:53.011
ON IMPAIRMENT LEVEL CHALLENGE

02:10:53.078 --> 02:10:54.813
EVEN THE BEST OF INTENTIONS.

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:56.148
SAID INCREASES IN MINNESOTA

02:10:56.215 --> 02:10:58.083
BURDENS LIMITS CONTINUITY OF

02:10:58.150 --> 02:10:58.951
CARE AND IS FRAUGHT WITH

02:10:59.017 --> 02:11:00.786
OPPORTUNITIES AND FROM THIS HAVE

02:11:00.852 --> 02:11:01.753
TO DO A LACK OF INFORMATION

02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:02.387
SHARING.

02:11:02.454 --> 02:11:04.089
AND LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:05.290
ALREADY SAID TODAY IT HAMPERS

02:11:05.357 --> 02:11:07.059
PERSON CENTERED CARE BECAUSE THE

02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:10.963
PROVIDER IN CARE SETTING.

02:11:11.029 --> 02:11:12.731
AND NOT AN INDIVIDUALS NEEDS.

02:11:12.798 --> 02:11:13.899
SOMEBODY IS A SORT OF MODIFIED

02:11:13.966 --> 02:11:15.334
CASE STUDY JUST TO TRY TO

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:17.202
HIGHLIGHT THIS FOR YOU AND LET'S

02:11:17.269 --> 02:11:18.270
USE THE EXAMPLE OF A MIDDLE AGED

02:11:18.337 --> 02:11:21.006
WOMAN EXPERIENCING DEPRESSION OR

02:11:21.073 --> 02:11:22.307
ANXIETY.

02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:23.508
THE PAPER SCRIBE AN

02:11:23.575 --> 02:11:24.810
ANTIDEPRESSANT AND ENCOURAGE YOU

02:11:24.876 --> 02:11:25.344
TO CALL BEACON FOR THERAPY

02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:26.378
REFERRAL.

02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:27.579
WHEN SHE CALLS FOR STATE

02:11:27.646 --> 02:11:28.947
REQUIREMENTS SHE UNDERGOES A

02:11:29.014 --> 02:11:30.949
BRIEF SCREENING SCREENING TO

02:11:31.016 --> 02:11:33.085
DETERMINE IF SHE FILES INTO MY

02:11:35.287 --> 02:11:35.821
ORANGE THE MODERATE TO SEVERE

02:11:35.887 --> 02:11:36.788
BUCKET.

02:11:36.855 --> 02:11:37.956
WE WORK IN TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES

02:11:38.023 --> 02:11:39.691
THAT MEANS EACH COUNTY HAS A

02:11:39.758 --> 02:11:40.626
DIFFERENT PROCESS FOR

02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:43.495
COORDINATING THOSE REFERRALS AND

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:45.497
A DIFFERENT CRITERIA.

02:11:45.564 --> 02:11:46.832
ARE DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR H.

02:11:46.898 --> 02:11:48.734
SHE WILL GET SERVICE AS SO

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:49.835
LITERALLY THE SAME PERSON AND

02:11:49.901 --> 02:11:51.403
ONE COUNTY MAY BE ACCEPTED INTO

02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:52.604
SERVICES I WON'T BE IN ANOTHER

02:11:52.671 --> 02:11:54.539
WE DO TRACK ALL OF THOSE

02:11:54.606 --> 02:11:55.741
REFERRALS AS KIM SAID.

02:11:55.807 --> 02:11:57.075
AND WE SCREEN ABOUT FORTY

02:11:57.142 --> 02:11:58.010
THOUSAND PEOPLE LAST YEAR IN

02:11:58.076 --> 02:12:00.078
ABOUT 96% STATE AT OUR LEVEL OF

02:12:00.145 --> 02:12:01.179
CARE.

02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:02.981
BUT ALL THAT TRACKING IS

02:12:03.048 --> 02:12:04.783
ADMINISTRATIVELY.

02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:06.518
BURDENSOME WHEN IT COULD

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:07.085
OTHERWISE BE SPENT ON MAKING

02:12:07.152 --> 02:12:10.489
PEOPLE SO IN THIS CASE OF THE

02:12:10.555 --> 02:12:11.590
WOMAN IS REFERRED TO A BEACON

02:12:11.657 --> 02:12:13.025
THERAPIST --

02:12:13.091 --> 02:12:14.026
BUT AFTER A FEW MONTHS LET'S SAY

02:12:14.092 --> 02:12:16.995
HER DEPRESSION WORSENS AND SHE

02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:18.764
SHE BECOME SUICIDAL SO SHE'S

02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:19.298
ADMITTED TO A PSYCHIATRIC

02:12:19.364 --> 02:12:20.666
FACILITY.

02:12:20.732 --> 02:12:22.267
AT THIS POINT BEACON HER

02:12:22.334 --> 02:12:23.669
THERAPIST HER HEALTH PLAN FOR

02:12:23.735 --> 02:12:25.637
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER NOBODY

02:12:25.704 --> 02:12:26.471
KNOWS SHE'S BEEN ADMITTED TO THE

02:12:26.538 --> 02:12:28.140
HOSPITAL BECAUSE THAT SERVICE IS

02:12:28.206 --> 02:12:30.409
NOW PAID FOR MANAGED BY THE

02:12:30.475 --> 02:12:30.942
COUNTY.

02:12:31.009 --> 02:12:31.510
EACH COUNTY HAS A DIFFERENT

02:12:31.576 --> 02:12:33.578
PROCESS FOR THE DISCHARGE

02:12:33.645 --> 02:12:34.546
PLANNING.

02:12:34.613 --> 02:12:36.048
BUT MORE THAN LIKELY SHE WON'T

02:12:36.114 --> 02:12:37.716
BE RECONNECTED WITH HER BEACON

02:12:37.783 --> 02:12:39.785
THERAPIST BECAUSE THAT THERAPIST

02:12:39.851 --> 02:12:41.687
IS NOT PART OF THE COUNTIES

02:12:41.753 --> 02:12:42.521
NETWORK.

02:12:42.587 --> 02:12:43.889
NOT MEAN SHE HAS TO START OVER

02:12:43.955 --> 02:12:45.324
ON HER TREATMENT JOURNEY.

02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:46.591
THERE ARE INSTANCES WHEN

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:48.160
SOMEBODY WILL BE DISCHARGED

02:12:48.226 --> 02:12:50.395
DIRECTLY FROM INPATIENT TO A

02:12:50.462 --> 02:12:52.030
MILD TO MODERATE PROVIDER.

02:12:52.097 --> 02:12:53.699
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE WE ARE

02:12:53.765 --> 02:12:55.033
UNABLE TO PAY FOR CASE

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.836
MANAGEMENT COLLATERAL AND THE

02:12:57.903 --> 02:12:59.137
OTHER REHABILITATION OPTION

02:12:59.204 --> 02:13:00.439
SERVICES THAT CAN HELP ADDRESS

02:13:00.505 --> 02:13:01.840
PSYCHO SOCIAL STRESSORS IN HER

02:13:01.907 --> 02:13:02.474
LIFE.

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:03.642
THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO

02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:05.377
HELP MAINTAIN SOMEBODY AT THE

02:13:05.444 --> 02:13:11.750
MODERATE LEVEL.

02:13:11.817 --> 02:13:13.385
SO WE BELIEVE THAT A BENEFICIARY

02:13:13.452 --> 02:13:14.586
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:16.655
ALLOW WILL BENEFITS AND SERVICES

02:13:16.722 --> 02:13:18.123
ACROSS THE FULL CONTINUUM FROM A

02:13:18.190 --> 02:13:20.592
SINGLE COHESIVE PROVIDER NETWORK.

02:13:20.659 --> 02:13:21.793
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO ORGANIZE

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.595
A SYSTEM OF CARE TO ACHIEVE THAT

02:13:23.662 --> 02:13:24.563
GOAL.

02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:26.298
YOU CAN WORKS WITH MEDICAID IN

02:13:26.365 --> 02:13:27.299
TWENTY STATES --

02:13:27.366 --> 02:13:29.634
THEN WE SEE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS

02:13:29.701 --> 02:13:31.870
OF ACHIEVING THAT GOAL.

02:13:31.937 --> 02:13:33.805
BUT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE A SYSTEM

02:13:33.872 --> 02:13:34.773
THAT REDUCES COMPLEXITY

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.875
EMPHASIZES PREVENTION AND EARLY

02:13:36.942 --> 02:13:37.843
INTERVENTION.

02:13:37.909 --> 02:13:39.111
ENSURES CONTINUITY OF CARE AND

02:13:39.177 --> 02:13:41.313
PROMOTES TRANSPARENCY AND

02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:43.815
QUALITY AN OUTCOME IMPROVEMENTS.

02:13:43.882 --> 02:13:45.717
I MAY USE MY LAST MINUTE TO

02:13:45.784 --> 02:13:46.685
FOCUS ON THE SYSTEM FOR EVENTS

02:13:46.752 --> 02:13:47.753
THAT ARE FEASIBLE WITHIN THE

02:13:47.819 --> 02:13:50.489
EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

02:13:50.555 --> 02:13:52.324
FOR CALIFORNIA.

02:13:52.391 --> 02:13:53.692
AND THE FIRST THE STATE SHOULD

02:13:53.759 --> 02:13:54.626
CONSIDER SOME BASELINE CREATING

02:13:54.693 --> 02:13:56.128
SOME BASELINE EXPECTATIONS FOR

02:13:56.194 --> 02:13:57.462
CRISIS SYSTEM DESIGN.

02:13:57.529 --> 02:13:59.030
AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROVIDE

02:13:59.097 --> 02:14:01.199
DIRECTIVES GUIDANCE TO COUNTIES

02:14:01.266 --> 02:14:02.501
AND DATA SHARING FOR BETTER

02:14:02.567 --> 02:14:04.536
COORDINATION PREVENTION AND

02:14:04.603 --> 02:14:06.004
EARLY INTERVENTION.

02:14:06.071 --> 02:14:08.206
SECOND CALIFORNIA SHOULD INVEST

02:14:08.273 --> 02:14:10.409
IN A LARGE SCALE IN LARGE SCALE

02:14:10.475 --> 02:14:11.743
REGIONAL PSYCHIATRIC

02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:13.845
CONSULTATION PROGRAMS THAT

02:14:13.912 --> 02:14:15.213
IMPROVE ACCESS AND QUALITY FOR

BY PROVIDING REAL TIME SUPPORT

02:14:17.649 --> 02:14:19.050
TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS.

02:14:19.117 --> 02:14:20.552
THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE PAYER

02:14:20.619 --> 02:14:22.120
AGNOSTIC.

02:14:22.187 --> 02:14:23.722
POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES COULD

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:25.257

PLANT MANAGED CARE PLANS CAN PAY.

02:14:32.931 --> 02:14:34.232
FOR THAT'S IMPROVING OUR ABILITY

02:14:34.299 --> 02:14:36.067
TO MAINTAIN INDIVIDUALS AT THE

02:14:36.134 --> 02:14:37.068
MODERATE LEVEL SO THEY DON'T

02:14:37.135 --> 02:14:38.837
NEED SPECIAL TEAM AT THE HOUSE

02:14:38.904 --> 02:14:40.572
SERVICES TO THE COUNTY.

02:14:40.639 --> 02:14:41.807

OBSERVATIONS FROM HEARING FROM

02:24:20.418 --> 02:24:21.085
YOUR COLLEAGUES IN OTHER

02:24:21.152 --> 02:24:22.220
COUNTIES --

02:24:22.286 --> 02:24:24.255

02:24:24.322 --> 02:24:25.957
AND TURN IN TERMS OF HOW WE DO

02:24:26.024 --> 02:24:29.127
THIS INTEGRATION WHEN YOU HAVE --

02:24:29.193 --> 02:24:30.028
AND AND AND PLACES AND WE DON'T

02:24:30.094 --> 02:24:31.662
HAVE THAT IN PLACES WHERE YOU

02:24:31.729 --> 02:24:33.064
DON'T HAVE --

02:24:33.131 --> 02:24:35.533
BASICALLY JUST THE NEED TO

02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:37.335
ENTITIES THE COME TOGETHER I

02:24:37.402 --> 02:24:39.504
MEAN I REALIZE MAYBE MORE BUT

02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:41.105
TWO MAJOR ENTITIES COME TOGETHER.

02:24:41.172 --> 02:24:42.540
WELL.

02:24:42.607 --> 02:24:44.008
YOU KNOW I I DO COME FROM A CO

02:24:44.075 --> 02:24:46.277
HSN I AGREE IT'S MUCH EASIER ON

02:24:46.344 --> 02:24:47.378
AND SEE WHAT JUST COUNTY I DON'T

02:24:47.445 --> 02:24:47.912
THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE --

02:24:47.979 --> 02:24:49.680
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY MORE

02:24:49.747 --> 02:24:51.816
COMPLICATED NOTHING'S POSSIBLE

02:24:51.883 --> 02:24:58.322
BUT BUT WELL I THINK --

02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:59.690
I'M THINKING ABOUT SAN DIEGO

02:24:59.757 --> 02:25:01.526
WHICH HAS I THINK IT'S SEVEN

02:25:01.592 --> 02:25:02.960
HEALTH PLANS ON BECAUSE THE

02:25:03.027 --> 02:25:04.595
GEOGRAPHIC MANAGE CARE LIKE

02:25:04.662 --> 02:25:05.196
SACRAMENTO.

02:25:05.263 --> 02:25:07.298
AN ARM IN SAN DIEGO --

02:25:07.365 --> 02:25:08.499
HAS DONE INTEREST YOU WORK OVER

02:25:08.566 --> 02:25:09.500
THE YEARS AND IT'S ANOTHER AREA

02:25:09.567 --> 02:25:11.602
BUT IT'S AN L. TSS LONG TERM

02:25:11.669 --> 02:25:12.904
SERVICE SUPPORT WITH THEY'VE

02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:13.538
ORGANIZES A COUNTY.

02:25:13.604 --> 02:25:14.872
AND THEY HAVE ON RELATIONSHIPS

02:25:14.939 --> 02:25:16.808
WITH ALL THE HEALTH PLANS AND I

02:25:16.874 --> 02:25:17.842
THINK IT.

02:25:17.909 --> 02:25:19.677
IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK BUT I

02:25:19.744 --> 02:25:22.547
THINK WHERE --

02:25:22.613 --> 02:25:23.815
YOU CAN HAVE A STANDARD COUNTY

02:25:23.881 --> 02:25:25.383
PROCESS AND THEN WORK WITH THE

02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:28.186
VARIOUS --

02:25:28.252 --> 02:25:29.087
PLANTS -- SO

02:25:29.153 --> 02:25:30.488
I I WOULDN'T GIVE UP ON IT

02:25:30.555 --> 02:25:32.223
ENTIRELY MAYBE WANNA START WITH

02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:33.925
THE CHS COUNTIES BUT I THINK

02:25:33.991 --> 02:25:35.259
THERE'S SOME IMMIGRATION WORK

02:25:35.326 --> 02:25:36.994
THAT HAS GONE ON IN OTHER AREAS

02:25:37.061 --> 02:25:38.830
NOT PAPER HEALTH THAT MIGHT BE

02:25:38.896 --> 02:25:41.299
VERY INSTRUCTIVE TO LOOK AT MORE.

02:25:41.365 --> 02:25:42.266
MORE DEEPLY.

02:25:42.333 --> 02:25:45.670
HE'S MADE MAYBE SOME STATE

02:25:45.736 --> 02:25:48.573
MANDATES WOULD HELP.

02:25:48.639 --> 02:25:49.674
WITHOUT REGARD TO GET COUNTY

02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:50.875
YEAH I'M IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE

02:25:50.942 --> 02:25:51.742
GMC WE HAVE SIX HEALTH PLANS

02:25:51.809 --> 02:25:52.543
RIGHT.

02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:54.979
AND IT'S NOT THERE THEIR

02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:55.580
RELATIONSHIP STRICTLY WITH THE

02:25:55.646 --> 02:25:58.382
STATE CELL THAT'S PROBLEMATIC

02:25:58.449 --> 02:25:59.684
BUT ANY OKAY.

02:25:59.750 --> 02:26:01.953
ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THAT AND

02:26:02.019 --> 02:26:03.254
THE LA YEAH.

02:26:03.321 --> 02:26:05.189
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE BEHALF

02:26:05.256 --> 02:26:06.757
OF ELEMENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

02:26:06.824 --> 02:26:07.391
THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION AND

02:26:07.458 --> 02:26:08.192
I CAN ONLY SPEAK FROM FROM MY

02:26:08.259 --> 02:26:09.594
EXPERIENCE AND I KNOW JUST

02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:10.628
INDIVIDUALLY IN WITH MY PROGRAM

02:26:10.695 --> 02:26:11.362
WHEN I WHEN THINGS COME UP I

02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:12.330
DON'T.

02:26:12.396 --> 02:26:14.198
I DON'T THINK HEALTH PLANS I I

02:26:14.265 --> 02:26:16.701
THINK CLINICALLY AND SO WHEN I

02:26:16.767 --> 02:26:18.803
SAY WE HAVE A WHATEVER IT TAKES

02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:20.071
MENTALITY THAT'S WHAT WE DO IS

02:26:20.138 --> 02:26:23.674
SO IF SOMEONE HAS HAS HEALTHCARE

02:26:23.741 --> 02:26:24.175
NEEDS THAT'S THAT'S CASE

02:26:24.242 --> 02:26:24.842
MANAGEMENT.

02:26:24.909 --> 02:26:25.776
WE JUST GO WE FIND THE HEALTH

02:26:25.843 --> 02:26:27.712
PLAN WE TAKE THEM THERE WE GET

02:26:27.778 --> 02:26:29.881
REFERRALS FROM BEGAN WE FOLLOW

02:26:29.947 --> 02:26:32.416
AT SO IT'S HARD FOR ME BECAUSE I

02:26:32.483 --> 02:26:33.818
DON'T I DON'T THINK AND AND

02:26:33.885 --> 02:26:35.820
ADMINISTRATIVELY AND IN TERMS OF

02:26:35.887 --> 02:26:38.456
THIS HEALTH PLAN OR IT JUST

02:26:38.523 --> 02:26:40.024
SOUNDS LIKE CASE MANAGEMENT.

02:26:40.091 --> 02:26:43.127
AND WE FOLLOW UP WHERE WE NEED.

02:26:43.194 --> 02:26:43.761
WE WE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM THE

02:26:43.828 --> 02:26:44.862
PREVIOUS PANEL THERE ARE PEOPLE

02:26:44.929 --> 02:26:46.030
WHO ARE LITERALLY STUCK IN

02:26:46.097 --> 02:26:47.965
BETWEEN WE HEARD FROM MY MY

02:26:48.032 --> 02:26:49.267
COLLEAGUES THAT HAPPENED TO ONE

02:26:49.333 --> 02:26:50.034
OF THE SO.

02:26:50.101 --> 02:26:52.336
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT YEAH I I

02:26:52.403 --> 02:26:53.004
I I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND I MEAN

02:26:53.070 --> 02:26:54.338
AS A FELLOW HEALTH PROFESSIONAL

02:26:54.405 --> 02:26:55.740
WERE ON THE GROUND WHICH WE WE

02:26:55.806 --> 02:26:57.808
TRY TO DO THAT RIGHT WE WE DON'T

02:26:57.875 --> 02:26:58.876
TRY TO SAY WHICH HEALTH PLAN BUT

02:26:58.943 --> 02:27:01.913
ULTIMATELY YOU DO RUN UP AGAINST

02:27:01.979 --> 02:27:04.048
THE WHO'S GOING TO PAY. FOR IT

02:27:04.115 --> 02:27:05.449
AND SO FORTH AND WHOSE GOOD FOR

02:27:05.516 --> 02:27:06.050
ON FRANKLY WHEN THE REASONS I

02:27:06.117 --> 02:27:06.617
AND IF FOR ANY FOR THE STATE

02:27:06.684 --> 02:27:08.019
LEGISLATURE WAS TRYING TO

02:27:08.085 --> 02:27:10.188
RECESSION WE HAD I HAD PATIENTS

02:27:10.254 --> 02:27:11.956
TO I MAINLY FOCUS ON CHILDREN

02:27:12.023 --> 02:27:13.291
WITH LEARNING AND FEARFUL

02:27:13.357 --> 02:27:16.194
DISORDERS --

02:27:16.260 --> 02:27:17.161
THAT -- I

02:27:17.228 --> 02:27:18.529
PATIENTS GOT GOT STOCK AND AND

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:19.931
DOES SO AS MUCH AS I WANTED TO

02:27:19.997 --> 02:27:22.033
BE AS A AS A SOMEONE ON THE

02:27:22.099 --> 02:27:24.669
FRONT LINES --

02:27:24.735 --> 02:27:25.269
TO BE EIGHT LET'S NOT PRETEND

02:27:25.336 --> 02:27:28.239
THE PROBLEM PAY FOR IT RIGHT IS

02:27:28.306 --> 02:27:29.040
GOING TO COVER IT HE'S GONNA

02:27:29.106 --> 02:27:30.708
ACCEPT THEM BECAUSE IF PEOPLE

02:27:30.775 --> 02:27:33.077
ARE GOING TO GET PAID.

02:27:33.144 --> 02:27:33.678
IT WAS REALLY HARD TO GET THEM

02:27:33.744 --> 02:27:35.012
CARE SO.

02:27:35.079 --> 02:27:36.214
THANK YOU.

02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:37.315
I FIND IT IT'S ACTUALLY EASY

02:27:37.381 --> 02:27:38.983
EASIER FOR US WITH THE COUNTY TO

02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:40.551
FIGURE OUT WHO'S GOING TO PAY

02:27:40.618 --> 02:27:41.786
FOR IT AND HOW TO PAY FOR IT.

02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:43.254
WITH OUR SPECIFIC PROGRAM WE'VE

02:27:43.321 --> 02:27:45.223
ACTUALLY HAD MORE TROUBLE WITH

02:27:45.289 --> 02:27:47.358
CLIENTS TO A PRIVATE INSURANCE

02:27:47.425 --> 02:27:49.393
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS SIMILAR TO

02:27:49.460 --> 02:27:50.928
WHAT THEY WERE SAYING EARLIER.

02:27:50.995 --> 02:27:52.496
WITH THE PRIVATE INSURANCE THE

02:27:52.563 --> 02:27:54.232
THE NEEDS THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:27:54.298 --> 02:27:56.000
SERVICES THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:27:56.067 --> 02:27:57.368
LEVEL OF TREATMENT THAT'S NEEDED.

02:27:57.435 --> 02:27:59.070
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

02:27:59.136 --> 02:28:00.471
PAY FOR IT WITH OUR OUR COUNTY

02:28:00.538 --> 02:28:02.406
ARE INDIGENT FINDS BUT THEN ONCE

02:28:02.473 --> 02:28:04.242
WE NEED TO REFER ON TO THE

02:28:04.308 --> 02:28:06.577
CONTRACT THAT THEY WERE IN THE

02:28:06.644 --> 02:28:06.844
SAME BOAT.

02:28:06.911 --> 02:28:09.647
THAT NO ONE CAN DO IT.

02:28:09.714 --> 02:28:10.147
I THANK YOU --

02:28:10.214 --> 02:28:11.215
I I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TAKING SOME

02:28:11.282 --> 02:28:12.416
NOTES I THINK WE'LL HAVE SOME

02:28:12.483 --> 02:28:14.051
FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR FOR YOU

02:28:14.118 --> 02:28:15.219
AS WELL BUT I DID AT ONE

I THOUGHT ILLUSTRATED.

02:37:21.064 --> 02:37:22.666
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

02:37:22.733 --> 02:37:25.169
FACE BUT ALSO THE OVERALL SYSTEM

02:37:25.235 --> 02:37:26.737
SO THAT WAS THAT WAS NICE WORK

02:37:26.804 --> 02:37:28.005
WHAT'S WORKING WELL WITHIN THE

02:37:28.071 --> 02:37:30.574
SYSTEM I I THINK THE FACT THAT

02:37:30.641 --> 02:37:31.742
THAT MEDI CAL --

02:37:31.809 --> 02:37:33.143
COVERS THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE

02:37:33.210 --> 02:37:34.678
ON THE FACT THAT THE ACA IN THE

02:37:34.745 --> 02:37:35.879
COVERAGES.

02:37:35.946 --> 02:37:37.181

THINK IS A WONDERFUL THING --

02:37:46.523 --> 02:37:48.392
THE OTHER THING I THINK IS

02:37:48.458 --> 02:37:50.527
WORKING WELL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

02:37:50.594 --> 02:37:51.528
IT IS.

02:37:51.595 --> 02:37:55.132
THAT WANT SOMEBODY IS ADMITTED

02:37:55.199 --> 02:37:56.800
TO MY HOSPITAL --

02:37:56.867 --> 02:37:58.635
THE SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE

02:37:58.702 --> 02:38:00.037
WHETHER THEY HAVE.

02:38:00.103 --> 02:38:01.171
KAISER.

IT'S IT'S EXCELLENT CARE THE

02:38:07.144 --> 02:38:08.712
SERVICE IS CONSISTENT.

02:38:08.779 --> 02:38:09.847
IT IS --

02:38:09.913 --> 02:38:11.448
EACH PATIENT IS TREATED THE SAME

02:38:11.515 --> 02:38:12.716
REGARDLESS OF FUNDING SO IN THAT

02:38:12.783 --> 02:38:14.451
SENSE MEDI CAL IN THE ACCESS

02:38:14.518 --> 02:38:16.286
THAT IT'S OPENED UP. TO

02:38:16.353 --> 02:38:18.789
PROVIDERS --

02:38:18.856 --> 02:38:20.424
IS IS GOOD IT'S JUST.

02:38:20.490 --> 02:38:21.859
GAINING THE ACCESS TO THE CARE

02:38:21.925 --> 02:38:24.928
WHICH IS WHERE THE RUB IS --

02:38:24.995 --> 02:38:26.363
I'M GONNA PRESENT THEM OR MY

02:38:26.430 --> 02:38:30.701
EXPERIENCE IS FROM THE LENS OF A

02:38:30.767 --> 02:38:32.035
HOSPITAL THAT HAS ADMITTED

02:38:32.102 --> 02:38:33.804
PATIENTS IN TWO THOUSAND AND

02:38:33.871 --> 02:38:34.671
EIGHTEEN FROM THIRTY EIGHT

02:38:34.738 --> 02:38:36.506
DIFFERENT COUNTIES OF THE FIFTY

02:38:36.573 --> 02:38:38.208
SIX OR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

02:38:38.275 --> 02:38:39.509
FIFTY SIX HEALTH PLANS SO.

02:38:39.576 --> 02:38:42.212
WE WE LITERALLY HAVE.

02:38:42.279 --> 02:38:44.214
A WITH A WIDE RANGE OF

02:38:44.281 --> 02:38:47.251
EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH THE

02:38:47.317 --> 02:38:48.852
INCONSISTENCIES THAT YOU HAVE

02:38:48.919 --> 02:38:51.421
HEARD MUCH TESTIMONY ABOUT.

02:38:51.488 --> 02:38:53.323
SO WHAT IS NOT WORKING WELL

02:38:53.390 --> 02:38:55.492
YOU'VE GOT A A DISJOINTED

02:38:55.559 --> 02:38:57.327
FRAGMENTED SYSTEM --

02:38:57.394 --> 02:38:59.529
YOU ALSO HAVE A SISTER THEY

02:38:59.596 --> 02:39:01.732
LEAVE.

02:39:01.798 --> 02:39:04.501
A HOSPITAL SETTING AGAIN COMING

02:39:04.568 --> 02:39:07.004
TO US IN A FIFTY ONE FIFTY

02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:08.238
SITUATION.

02:39:08.305 --> 02:39:09.840
THEIR POST DISCHARGE SUPPORT AND

02:39:09.907 --> 02:39:11.808
SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE MEDI

02:39:11.875 --> 02:39:13.510
CAL BENEFICIARIES.

02:39:13.577 --> 02:39:14.711
IS LACKING.

02:39:14.778 --> 02:39:16.546
BOTTOM LINE AND THEN MAINTAINING

02:39:16.613 --> 02:39:17.915
ELIGIBILITY --

02:39:17.981 --> 02:39:19.650
I THINK THERE'S WORK TO COULD BE

02:39:19.716 --> 02:39:21.518
DONE FOR FOLKS FOLKS WITH MENTAL

02:39:21.585 --> 02:39:23.053
ILLNESS --

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:24.821
AND FOLKS ENROLLED IN MEDICARE

02:39:24.888 --> 02:39:25.455
ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT

02:39:25.522 --> 02:39:26.290
GO.

02:39:26.356 --> 02:39:28.659
HAND IN HAND WITH BOTH REALITIES.

02:39:28.725 --> 02:39:30.427
THE REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAIN

02:39:30.494 --> 02:39:31.828
COVERAGE IN MEDI CAL IN THE

02:39:31.895 --> 02:39:33.130
PAPERWORK IT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN

02:39:33.196 --> 02:39:34.598
THE QUARTERLY TIME LINES AND

02:39:34.665 --> 02:39:35.699
WHAT NOT.

02:39:35.766 --> 02:39:40.837
IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S INHERENTLY --

02:39:40.904 --> 02:39:42.439
GONNA BE HARDER FOR SOMEBODY TO

02:39:42.506 --> 02:39:43.974
MAINTAIN THEIR MEDICAL COVERAGE

02:39:44.041 --> 02:39:45.742
VERSUS THOSE I THINK WITHOUT

02:39:45.809 --> 02:39:48.011
CHRONIC MENTAL ILLNESS --

02:39:48.078 --> 02:39:50.013
THE DELIVERY SYSTEM BEING

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:51.348
FRAGMENTED AND CHALLENGING.

02:39:51.415 --> 02:39:53.383
AT BEST IS REALLY A REFLECTION

02:39:53.450 --> 02:39:54.618
OF THE COUNTY BY COUNTY I CAN GO

02:39:54.685 --> 02:39:56.219
INTO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES BUT

02:39:56.286 --> 02:39:58.088
BOTTOM LINE IS WE DEAL WITH EACH

02:39:58.155 --> 02:39:59.256
COUNTY DIFFERENTLY.

02:39:59.323 --> 02:40:01.858
IN IN HOW PATIENTS ARE ADMITTED --

02:40:01.925 --> 02:40:03.794
IN HOW PATIENTS ARE UTILIZATION

02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:04.995
REVIEW THAT WE DO WITH THE

02:40:05.062 --> 02:40:07.097
COUNTY IS AN ON GOING BASIS HOW

02:40:07.164 --> 02:40:09.166
WE BUILD THE COUNTIES.

02:40:09.232 --> 02:40:10.100
HOW WE --

02:40:10.167 --> 02:40:11.635
THE FORMS THAT WE USE MAY BE

02:40:11.702 --> 02:40:13.203
CONSISTENT FROM ONE COUNTY TO

02:40:13.270 --> 02:40:14.438
THE NEXT BUT ONE COUNTY MAY SAY

02:40:14.504 --> 02:40:16.506
WE WANT THIS OVAL FILLED IN IN

02:40:16.573 --> 02:40:17.641
THE NEXT COUNTY SAYS NO YOU

02:40:17.708 --> 02:40:18.809
DON'T FEEL AND THAT ALL VOTES

02:40:18.875 --> 02:40:20.444
LITERALLY DOWN TO THAT LEVEL OF

02:40:20.510 --> 02:40:22.112
DETAIL -- IN

02:40:22.179 --> 02:40:24.147
IN THAT LACK OF CONSISTENCY AS A

02:40:24.214 --> 02:40:25.315
PROVIDER.

02:40:25.382 --> 02:40:26.883
WHERE I'VE GOT?

02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:29.720
HELLO TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE FULL

02:40:29.786 --> 02:40:30.320
TIME EMPLOYEES IS DEALING WITH

02:40:30.387 --> 02:40:31.655
IT.

02:40:31.722 --> 02:40:33.357
IS IS DIFFICULT IS ALMOST

02:40:33.423 --> 02:40:34.725
IMPOSSIBLE I COULD IMAGINE WHAT

02:40:34.791 --> 02:40:36.026
IT'S LIKE FOR THE CONSUMER.

02:40:36.093 --> 02:40:38.128
SO SO THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM THAT

02:40:38.195 --> 02:40:39.496
LACK OF CONSISTENCY FROM COUNTY

02:40:39.563 --> 02:40:41.064
TO COUNTY --

02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:43.133
THE POST DISCHARGE SERVICES.

02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:44.568

WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY --

02:40:48.205 --> 02:40:49.039

02:40:49.106 --> 02:40:50.240
CONJUNCTION WITH THE COUNTY

02:40:50.307 --> 02:40:51.408
PATIENTS THAT.

02:40:51.475 --> 02:40:52.142
THEIR SEVERITY LEVEL IN THEIR

02:40:52.209 --> 02:40:55.612
NEED FOR OUT PAY ABOUT A THIRD

02:40:55.679 --> 02:40:57.681
OF OUR PATIENTS OF THE SIX

02:40:57.748 --> 02:40:58.348
THOUSAND I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT

02:40:58.415 --> 02:41:00.117
ARE NEEDED. TWO THOUSAND OR SO

02:41:00.183 --> 02:41:01.785
WERE MEDI CAL.

02:41:01.852 --> 02:41:03.353
THE COUNTY WE WILL EVALUATE THE

02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:05.288
NEED FOR FOLLOW UP SERVICES IN

02:41:05.355 --> 02:41:06.857
THAT MEDI CAL POPULATION ABOUT A

02:41:06.923 --> 02:41:09.292
THIRD QUALIFY FOR THE INTENSIVE

02:41:09.359 --> 02:41:11.328
SERVICES A TURNING POINT --

02:41:11.395 --> 02:41:13.096
TELECARE THOSE TYPE OF SERVICES

02:41:13.163 --> 02:41:15.565
BUT TWO THIRDS DO NOT SO THERE'S

02:41:15.632 --> 02:41:16.166
TWO THIRDS OF THE OF THE MEDI

02:41:16.233 --> 02:41:17.200
CAL.

02:41:17.267 --> 02:41:18.969
PATIENTS ARE ADMITTED TO SERVICE

02:41:19.036 --> 02:41:19.836
ARE GOING TO BE DISCHARGED

02:41:19.903 --> 02:41:21.605
WITHOUT ACCESS TO IMMEDIATE

02:41:21.671 --> 02:41:22.906
FOLLOW ABOUT PATIENT CARE LIKE

02:41:22.973 --> 02:41:24.474

INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT SERVICES.

02:41:26.043 --> 02:41:28.211

02:41:28.278 --> 02:41:30.514
PROVIDER FOR THIRTY DAYS OR MORE --

02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:32.015
AND THEN THE LAST PIECE ABOUT

02:41:32.082 --> 02:41:33.583
WHAT'S NOT WORKING WELL AS THE

02:41:33.650 --> 02:41:35.786
ELIGIBILITY PIECES I MENTION

02:41:35.852 --> 02:41:36.119
BEFORE JUST.

02:41:36.186 --> 02:41:37.320
BY -- AS WE

02:41:37.387 --> 02:41:38.688
SPEAK EVERITT TO PATIENTS AT

02:41:38.755 --> 02:41:40.824
THEIR MEDI CAL HAS EXPIRED

02:41:40.891 --> 02:41:42.125
FEBRUARYTWENTY EIGHTH MARCH

02:41:42.192 --> 02:41:43.660
FIRST THEY'RE NO LONGER ENROLLED

02:41:43.727 --> 02:41:45.128
IN MEDICARE NOW --

02:41:45.195 --> 02:41:46.830
WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET

02:41:46.897 --> 02:41:49.399
THEM REINSTATED IN MEDI CAL TO

02:41:49.466 --> 02:41:51.368
VARYING LEVELS OF SUCCESS BUT

02:41:51.435 --> 02:41:53.003
THEY WILL.

02:41:53.070 --> 02:41:53.570
THERE'S A CHANCE THEY WILL

02:41:53.637 --> 02:41:55.405
DISCHARGE WITH NO MEDICAL MILK

02:41:55.472 --> 02:41:58.842
NO MEDICAL COVERAGE IN A FAX SO

02:41:58.909 --> 02:42:00.444
WHAT CAN WE DO.

02:42:00.510 --> 02:42:01.545
I THINK A DOCTOR ANY SYSTEM

02:42:01.611 --> 02:42:04.047
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE ELEVEN

02:42:04.114 --> 02:42:05.215
FIFTEEN BE WAIVER --

02:42:05.282 --> 02:42:06.450
BUT ANY SYSTEM THAT BRINGS

02:42:06.516 --> 02:42:08.885
GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND AND

02:42:08.952 --> 02:42:11.521
AND REDUCES THE INCONSISTENCY

02:42:11.588 --> 02:42:12.722
FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AND IF

02:42:12.789 --> 02:42:13.924
THAT'S DONE THROUGH.

02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:15.459
THE COUNTIES GETTING PAID ON A

02:42:15.525 --> 02:42:16.860
CAPITATED BASIS ARE USING A

02:42:16.927 --> 02:42:18.528
CARVIN SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO

02:42:18.595 --> 02:42:20.497
TAP INTO THE FEDERAL MATCHING

02:42:20.564 --> 02:42:21.565
DOLLARS.

02:42:21.631 --> 02:42:23.400
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE --

02:42:23.467 --> 02:42:24.434
NOT ONLY FINANCIALLY WOULD MAKE

02:42:24.501 --> 02:42:26.169
SENSE BUT IT WOULD BRING

02:42:26.236 --> 02:42:28.138
CONSISTENCY TO THE TO THE TO THE

02:42:28.205 --> 02:42:30.373
SYSTEM AND THIS REPORT MENTIONED

02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:32.976
THAT ANY PROPOSAL. TO TO GET THE

02:42:33.043 --> 02:42:35.479
WAIVER DAHLE THE FEDERAL

02:42:35.545 --> 02:42:36.746
GOVERNMENT CMS NEEDS TO BE

02:42:36.813 --> 02:42:38.448
BUDGET NEUTRAL.

02:42:38.515 --> 02:42:40.117
I WOULD PROPOSE THAT YOU COULD

02:42:40.183 --> 02:42:43.520
INCLUDE IN THE APPLICATION --

02:42:43.587 --> 02:42:46.790
THE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRISIS

02:42:46.857 --> 02:42:48.758
INTERVENTION SERVICES ARE MORE --

02:42:48.825 --> 02:42:49.926
PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION OR I'LL

02:42:49.993 --> 02:42:51.561
OUTPATIENT SERVICES TO PREVENT

02:42:51.628 --> 02:42:52.696
PEOPLE FROM GETTING INTO THE

02:42:52.762 --> 02:42:53.930
HOSPITAL WHICH I THINK WOULD

02:42:53.997 --> 02:42:55.699
OVERALL REDUCE THE INPATIENT

02:42:55.765 --> 02:42:57.968
MISSIONS AND COULD POTENTIALLY

02:42:58.034 --> 02:43:00.871
BE BUDGET NEUTRAL --

02:43:00.937 --> 02:43:01.938
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS

02:43:02.005 --> 02:43:03.507
ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY THE

02:43:03.573 --> 02:43:08.278
STATE IN REDUCING THE THE

02:43:08.345 --> 02:43:09.579
REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAIN

02:43:09.646 --> 02:43:12.349
ELIGIBILITY FOR THOSE THE

02:43:12.415 --> 02:43:14.918
SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS --

02:43:14.985 --> 02:43:16.786
I WOULD APPRECIATE I THINK THEY

02:43:16.853 --> 02:43:17.420
SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT DOING THAT

02:43:17.487 --> 02:43:19.389
THANK YOU.

02:43:19.456 --> 02:43:22.359
THANK YOU.

ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND WE

02:43:29.399 --> 02:43:29.966
WORK ON A NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE

02:43:30.033 --> 02:43:31.334

HERE TODAY.

02:43:35.005 --> 02:43:36.406
AND I WANT TO START OFF BY

02:43:36.473 --> 02:43:37.807
SHARING SOME DATA --

02:43:37.874 --> 02:43:39.176
THAT'S BEING PASSED AROUND SO

02:43:39.242 --> 02:43:41.845
YOU HAVE THE VISUAL I'M IN

02:43:41.912 --> 02:43:42.579
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE SPONSORED

02:43:42.646 --> 02:43:43.547
LEGISLATION --

02:43:43.613 --> 02:43:45.549
BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA TO

02:43:45.615 --> 02:43:47.784
REQUIRE DH CS TO REPORT OUT ON

02:43:47.851 --> 02:43:50.453
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH --

02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:52.122
WITH DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATOR SO BY

02:43:52.189 --> 02:43:53.356
RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGE IT

02:43:53.423 --> 02:43:55.325
CETERA AND SO THIS IS RELATIVELY

02:43:55.392 --> 02:43:56.459
NEW DATA THE DEPARTMENT JUST

02:43:56.526 --> 02:43:58.895
RELEASED IT I'M AT THE END OF

02:43:58.962 --> 02:43:59.496
TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT THERE'S A

02:43:59.563 --> 02:44:00.564
FEW THINGS THAT WE'VE ALREADY

02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:02.065
LEARNED FROM LOOKING AT IT THAT

02:44:02.132 --> 02:44:03.533
I THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO KNOW.

02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:05.969
SO THE FIRST IS THAT MENTAL

02:44:06.036 --> 02:44:08.438
HEALTH UTILIZATION SEC ISLANDER

02:44:08.505 --> 02:44:10.006
CONSUMERS HAVING THE LOW IS BY

02:44:10.073 --> 02:44:12.909
FAR THE LOWEST UTILIZATION RATES.

02:44:12.976 --> 02:44:14.311
AND I MISTER MAC EXPLAINED

02:44:14.377 --> 02:44:15.011
REALLY WELL SORT OF THE

02:44:15.078 --> 02:44:15.779
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

02:44:15.845 --> 02:44:16.980
PENETRATION RATE AND THE

02:44:17.047 --> 02:44:18.815
ENGAGEMENT RATE WE ALSO SEE

02:44:18.882 --> 02:44:20.550
DISPARITIES WHEN WE LOOK AT SORT

02:44:20.617 --> 02:44:21.685
OF THE DROP OFF FROM THE

02:44:21.751 --> 02:44:22.652
PENETRATION RATE TO THE

02:44:22.719 --> 02:44:23.720
ENGAGEMENT RATE AND THERE'S THE

02:44:23.787 --> 02:44:25.388
LARGEST DROP OFF FROM PEOPLE WHO

02:44:25.455 --> 02:44:26.056
ARE POTENTIALLY.

02:44:26.122 --> 02:44:28.692
JUST AS FAST AND NOT ENGAGED IN

02:44:28.758 --> 02:44:31.294
TREATMENT FOR BLACK CONSUMERS SO

02:44:31.361 --> 02:44:31.895
WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:44:31.962 --> 02:44:32.729
NOTE.

02:44:32.796 --> 02:44:33.697
TO MENTAL HEALTH UTILIZATION

02:44:33.763 --> 02:44:35.232
ALSO VARIES BY LANGUAGE AS YOU

02:44:35.298 --> 02:44:36.766
CAN SEE BY THE GRAPH YOU HAVE IN

02:44:36.833 --> 02:44:38.802
FRONT OF YOU WITH ONLY ABOUT 1%

02:44:38.868 --> 02:44:41.071
OF BENEFICIARIES WHOSE PRIMARY

02:44:41.137 --> 02:44:42.072
LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH BEING

02:44:42.138 --> 02:44:45.008
CAN ENGAGED IN SERVICES.

02:44:45.075 --> 02:44:45.775
I'M AND THERE'S OTHER LANGUAGES

02:44:45.842 --> 02:44:47.844
THAT HAVE EVEN SMALLER NUMBERS

02:44:47.911 --> 02:44:49.346
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING ENGAGE

02:44:49.412 --> 02:44:50.680
NUMBER SO SMALL THAT THEY CAN'T

02:44:50.747 --> 02:44:52.249
BE PUBLICLY REPORTED.

02:44:52.315 --> 02:44:53.783
AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

02:44:53.850 --> 02:44:54.651
TO NOTE THAT WHILE THERE ARE

02:44:54.718 --> 02:44:56.419
MANY IMPORTANT EFFORTS UNDER WAY

02:44:56.486 --> 02:44:57.988
THERE'S INDICATIONS THAT

02:44:58.054 --> 02:44:59.289
DISPARITIES ARE ACTUALLY NOT.

02:44:59.356 --> 02:45:01.057
I'M GETTING SMALLER OVER TIME

02:45:01.124 --> 02:45:02.092
AND SO YOU CAN SEE WE GAVE THE

02:45:02.158 --> 02:45:03.693
EXAMPLE OF LANGUAGE BUT THE

02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:05.295
DISPARITY BETWEEN ENGLISH

02:45:05.362 --> 02:45:06.730
PRIMARY ENGLISH SPEAKERS.

02:45:06.796 --> 02:45:08.265
AND I PRIMARY NON ENGLISH

02:45:08.331 --> 02:45:09.566
SPEAKERS IS ACTUALLY REMAINED

02:45:09.633 --> 02:45:12.469
FAIRLY CONSISTENT FROM TWENTY

02:45:12.535 --> 02:45:13.036
THIRTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:45:13.103 --> 02:45:13.737
WHICH I THINK IT'S DISAPPOINTING.

02:45:13.803 --> 02:45:14.971
I'M AND THEN FINALLY WHEN WE

02:45:15.038 --> 02:45:16.406
LOOK AT OUTCOMES WOULD JUST

02:45:16.473 --> 02:45:17.941
AGAIN GIVEN ONE EXAMPLE --

02:45:18.008 --> 02:45:19.309
BUT THE TIME IT TAKES FOR

02:45:19.376 --> 02:45:20.543
SOMEONE TO STEP DOWN FROM AN

02:45:20.610 --> 02:45:22.412
INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION TO A

02:45:22.479 --> 02:45:23.980
LOWER LEVEL OF KERR VARIES BY

02:45:24.047 --> 02:45:25.248
RACE WITH BLACK CONSUMERS HAVING

02:45:25.315 --> 02:45:27.284
A CONSIDERABLY LONGER AVERAGE

02:45:27.350 --> 02:45:29.319
TIME. TO BE DISCHARGED FROM

02:45:29.386 --> 02:45:30.687
INPATIENT SETTING AND ENGAGE IN

02:45:30.754 --> 02:45:31.888
FOLLOW UP CARE.

02:45:31.955 --> 02:45:33.957
AND I WOULD NOTE AGAIN AT THE

02:45:34.024 --> 02:45:35.792
STATE THAT ONLY ONLY LOOKS AT

02:45:35.859 --> 02:45:36.593
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND

02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:37.594
UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:45:37.661 --> 02:45:38.928
SAME LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY

02:45:38.995 --> 02:45:40.196
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.

02:45:40.263 --> 02:45:41.698
ON THE MANAGED CARE SITES THAT

02:45:41.765 --> 02:45:42.966
WOULD BE ONE RECOMMENDATION IS

02:45:43.033 --> 02:45:44.000
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO THIS

02:45:44.067 --> 02:45:45.635
KIND OF ANALYSIS ON THE MANAGED

02:45:45.702 --> 02:45:46.970
CARE SIDE.

02:45:47.037 --> 02:45:48.538
I DO THINK THAT THE ANALYSIS DID

02:45:48.605 --> 02:45:50.040
A AT THE BACKGROUND DID A REALLY

02:45:50.106 --> 02:45:51.908
NICE JOB OF TALKING ABOUT SORT

02:45:51.975 --> 02:45:53.109
OF WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE IN

02:45:53.176 --> 02:45:54.744
TERMS OF UTILIZATION IN COUNTY

02:45:54.811 --> 02:45:55.578
MENTAL HEALTH AND SPECIALTY

02:45:55.645 --> 02:45:56.513
MENTAL HEALTH.

02:45:56.579 --> 02:45:58.615
AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE IN THE

02:45:58.682 --> 02:46:01.184
MANAGED CARE PLAN HOW MEMBERS

02:46:01.251 --> 02:46:02.452
WHO SHOULD BE ACCESSING CARE

02:46:02.519 --> 02:46:03.753
FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN BECAUSE

02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:04.721
OF THE LEVEL.

02:46:04.788 --> 02:46:06.456
OF I NEED THAT THE HEALTH PLAN

02:46:06.523 --> 02:46:08.024
SHOULD BE ADDRESSING AND YET THE

02:46:08.091 --> 02:46:09.426
UTILIZATION READ HER RATES ARE

02:46:09.492 --> 02:46:11.594
ACTUALLY FAIRLY COMPARABLE SO WE

02:46:11.661 --> 02:46:13.296
UNDERSTAND THAT THE MANAGED CARE

02:46:13.363 --> 02:46:14.831
BENEFIT IS STILL SORT OF NEW.

02:46:14.898 --> 02:46:16.166
BUT BUT I THINK WE'RE REALLY

02:46:16.232 --> 02:46:17.701
CONCERNED ABOUT DO PEOPLE KNOW

02:46:17.767 --> 02:46:19.135
THAT THAT'S A BENEFIT TO PEOPLE

02:46:19.202 --> 02:46:20.537
KNOW HOW TO ACCESS IT.

02:46:20.603 --> 02:46:22.706
AND SO IF YOU RECOMMENDATIONS

02:46:22.772 --> 02:46:24.574
THAT WE HAVE I'M ONE IS TO

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:25.909
LEVERAGE THE STRENGTH OF COUNTY

02:46:25.975 --> 02:46:26.976
MENTAL HEALTH.

02:46:27.043 --> 02:46:28.211
I'M TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

02:46:28.278 --> 02:46:29.546
CONSUMERS WHO HAVE COMPLEX

02:46:29.612 --> 02:46:31.114
MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH

02:46:31.181 --> 02:46:33.383
NEEDS AS WELL AS THOSE WERE NOT

02:46:33.450 --> 02:46:35.018
MEDICAL MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE AND

02:46:35.085 --> 02:46:36.119
DOCTOR BUNCH DID A REALLY NICE

02:46:36.186 --> 02:46:37.754
JOB SO I WON'T REITERATE OF

02:46:37.821 --> 02:46:38.788
TALKING AT SOME OF THE STRENGTH

02:46:38.855 --> 02:46:40.056
OF COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH.

02:46:40.123 --> 02:46:42.192
BUT I DID WANT TO TO TO SENATOR

02:46:42.258 --> 02:46:43.893
DRAWS AS EARLY EARLIER POINT

02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:45.795
TOUCH ON THE ACCESS FOR FOLKS

02:46:45.862 --> 02:46:46.963
WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED --

02:46:47.030 --> 02:46:48.298
WE'VE JUST CONDUCTED AT A

02:46:48.365 --> 02:46:50.166
RESEARCH PROJECT ON THAT WE'VE

02:46:50.233 --> 02:46:50.834
INTERVIEWED OVER A DOZEN

02:46:50.900 --> 02:46:52.369
COUNTIES AND I THINK THEY ARE

02:46:52.435 --> 02:46:53.570
YOU KNOW THERE'S BROAD AGREEMENT

02:46:53.636 --> 02:46:54.304
BROUGHT UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:46:54.371 --> 02:46:55.638
COUNTIES HAVE FLEXIBILITY WITH

02:46:55.705 --> 02:46:56.973
SOME OF THEIR FUNDS TO SERVE

02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:58.341
THIS POPULATION THAT IS.

02:46:58.408 --> 02:47:00.610
VASTLY UNDER SERVED HOWEVER I

02:47:00.677 --> 02:47:01.277
THINK THERE'S SOME REAL

02:47:01.344 --> 02:47:02.812
CHALLENGES FOR COUNTIES DOING

02:47:02.879 --> 02:47:04.914
THAT AND I THINK ONE IS SORT OF

02:47:04.981 --> 02:47:07.183
A POLITICAL PROBLEM OF MOST

02:47:07.250 --> 02:47:07.951
COUNTIES WILL TELL US YES IF

02:47:08.017 --> 02:47:09.519
SOMEONE GETS TO OUR DOOR WE WILL

02:47:09.586 --> 02:47:11.221
SERVE THEM WE HAVE FUNDS TO PAY

02:47:11.287 --> 02:47:11.488
FOR THEM.

02:47:11.554 --> 02:47:12.589
BUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF COUNTIES

02:47:12.655 --> 02:47:13.857
THAT ARE NOT DOING PROACTIVE OUT

02:47:13.923 --> 02:47:15.325
REACH TO UNDOCUMENTED

02:47:15.392 --> 02:47:16.326
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:47:16.393 --> 02:47:17.360
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POLITICAL

02:47:17.427 --> 02:47:18.762
RAMIFICATIONS SO SOMEBODY NEVER

02:47:18.828 --> 02:47:20.430
FIND OUT THEY CAN GET SERVICES

02:47:20.497 --> 02:47:21.030
FROM YOU THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

02:47:21.097 --> 02:47:21.765
GET THREE OR DOOR.

02:47:21.831 --> 02:47:23.566
I'M SO WE WE DO BELIEVE THAT

02:47:23.633 --> 02:47:24.601
COULD BE CLARIFIED SOME

02:47:24.667 --> 02:47:25.702
ADDITIONAL BACKING FROM THE

02:47:25.769 --> 02:47:28.171
STATE WOULD BE HELPFUL THERE.

02:47:28.238 --> 02:47:30.240
I'M WE ALSO THINK THAT FOR BOTH

02:47:30.306 --> 02:47:32.776
COUNTIES AND HEALTH PLANS WE

02:47:32.842 --> 02:47:33.910
REALLY DO NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS

02:47:33.977 --> 02:47:36.246
THE MORE VALUE BASED ON PAYMENT

02:47:36.312 --> 02:47:37.580
METHODOLOGIES AND THAT IN

02:47:37.647 --> 02:47:38.815
PARTICULAR WHEN WE DO THAT WE

02:47:38.882 --> 02:47:40.417
NEED TO LOOK AT DISPARITIES AND

02:47:40.483 --> 02:47:41.818
SO WE NEED TO DESEGREGATE OUR

02:47:41.885 --> 02:47:42.352
DATE OUT BECAUSE YOU CAN.

02:47:42.419 --> 02:47:44.387
MAKE OVERALL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

02:47:44.454 --> 02:47:45.588
BUT ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO WORSEN

02:47:45.655 --> 02:47:47.190
DISPARITIES AS WE DO SEE IN SOME

02:47:47.257 --> 02:47:52.595
OF THE STATE US SO THAT WE NEED

02:47:52.662 --> 02:47:53.730
TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT.

02:47:53.797 --> 02:47:54.731
I'M WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

02:47:54.798 --> 02:47:55.398
TO REVIEW THE OUTREACH MATERIALS

02:47:55.465 --> 02:47:56.666
THAT GO TO CONSUMERS BOTH FROM

02:47:56.733 --> 02:47:57.300
DH CS AND FROM HEALTH PLANS IN

02:47:57.367 --> 02:47:59.102
PARTICULAR BECAUSE WE KNOW MOST

02:47:59.169 --> 02:48:00.069
CONSUMERS WHO NEED THOSE

02:48:00.136 --> 02:48:01.704
SERVICES ARE NOT ACCESSING THEM

02:48:01.771 --> 02:48:02.372
SO THERE'S SOME KIND OF

02:48:02.439 --> 02:48:03.840
BREAKDOWN IS PROBABLY MULTIPLE

02:48:03.907 --> 02:48:05.008
BARRIERS.

02:48:05.074 --> 02:48:06.376
I'M AND THEN JUST A COUPLE MORE

02:48:06.443 --> 02:48:08.278
THINGS SO ONE IS TO MAKE SURE

02:48:08.344 --> 02:48:10.447
THAT OUR OUR CONTRACTED MANAGED

02:48:10.513 --> 02:48:12.182
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS

02:48:12.248 --> 02:48:12.782
THAT ARE WORKING WITH MANY OF

02:48:12.849 --> 02:48:13.650
OUR HEALTH PLANS.

02:48:13.716 --> 02:48:15.318
DO HAVE ADEQUATE NETWORKS ARE

02:48:15.385 --> 02:48:16.586
MEETING TIMELY ACCESS AND

02:48:16.653 --> 02:48:17.987
PARTICULARLY OUR MEETING TIMELY

02:48:18.054 --> 02:48:19.622
ACCESS TO INTERPRETER SERVICES

02:48:19.689 --> 02:48:20.857
WHICH IS A PLACE WHERE WE

02:48:20.924 --> 02:48:22.258
CONTINUE TO SEE A PROBLEM.

02:48:22.325 --> 02:48:25.895
I'M ON THAT END AND WE COMMENTS

02:48:25.962 --> 02:48:27.297
ABOUT SCREENING AND MEDICAL

02:48:27.363 --> 02:48:28.798
NECESSITY AND WOULD JUST ADD

02:48:28.865 --> 02:48:30.366
THAT IT DITION TO MAKING SURE

02:48:30.433 --> 02:48:31.534
THAT WE DO THE TRAUMA SCREENING

02:48:31.601 --> 02:48:32.769
AND WE BROUGHT IN THE MEDICAL

02:48:32.836 --> 02:48:34.404
NECESSITY DEFINITION.

02:48:34.471 --> 02:48:35.572
THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT

02:48:35.638 --> 02:48:36.973
TRANSLATIONS PARTICULAR

02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:38.541
PARTICULARLY FOR ASSESSMENT

02:48:38.608 --> 02:48:40.109
BECAUSE PARTICULAR TALKING

02:48:40.176 --> 02:48:40.944
MENTAL HEALTH NOT EVERYTHING HAS

02:48:41.010 --> 02:48:41.611
A DIRECT.

02:48:41.678 --> 02:48:42.946
TRANSLATION AND SO WE'VE

02:48:43.012 --> 02:48:44.314
ACTUALLY TALKED TO AN

02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:45.782
ORGANIZATION THAT HAS TO TRAIN

02:48:45.849 --> 02:48:47.250
THEIR MEMBERS ON WHAT THEY NEED

02:48:47.317 --> 02:48:48.952
TO SAY IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE

02:48:49.018 --> 02:48:50.687
WHICH WORDS THEY NEED TO USE AND

02:48:50.753 --> 02:48:52.121
NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO DO THAT.

02:48:52.188 --> 02:48:54.624
AND AND THEN JUST JUST TWO MORE

02:48:54.691 --> 02:48:56.292
THINGS ONE IS --

02:48:56.359 --> 02:48:57.760
ALL COUNTIES HAVE A CULTURAL

02:48:57.827 --> 02:48:59.562
COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT PLAN THAT

02:48:59.629 --> 02:49:00.797
THEY PUT TOGETHER EVERY THREE

02:49:00.864 --> 02:49:02.465
YEARS AND THIS PLAN IS SUPPOSED

02:49:02.532 --> 02:49:03.199
TO BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND

02:49:03.266 --> 02:49:04.267
APPROVAL BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:49:04.334 --> 02:49:05.602
HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

02:49:05.668 --> 02:49:06.603
BUT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE

02:49:06.669 --> 02:49:08.004
FEEL LIKE OVERSIGHT IS REALLY

02:49:08.071 --> 02:49:09.539
LACKING THAT THAT REVIEW AND

02:49:09.606 --> 02:49:11.207
APPROVAL HASN'T HAPPENED I'M IN

02:49:11.274 --> 02:49:12.475
MANY YEARS AND COUNTIES HAVEN'T

02:49:12.542 --> 02:49:13.843
BEEN SUPPORTED IN DEVELOPING

02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:15.311
THESE CRUCIAL PLANS.

02:49:15.378 --> 02:49:16.379
I'M AND THEN FINALLY WE THINK WE

02:49:16.446 --> 02:49:17.547
NEED AN OVER ARCHING STATE

02:49:17.614 --> 02:49:18.915
FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTHEQUITY THAT

02:49:18.982 --> 02:49:20.450
INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH EQUITY

02:49:20.517 --> 02:49:21.718
AND REALLY LEVERAGES THE NEW

02:49:21.784 --> 02:49:22.886
POSITION OF THE CALIFORNIA

TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS --

02:49:40.937 --> 02:49:42.539
WHEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE DISCHARGED

02:49:42.605 --> 02:49:44.007
AND WHETHER IT THERE MEDI CAL

02:49:44.073 --> 02:49:45.375
PATIENTS?

02:49:45.441 --> 02:49:47.143
HE SAID OF DID YOU SAY TWO

02:49:47.210 --> 02:49:49.012
THIRDS OF THEM HAVE NO ABILITY

TO FOR FOLLOW UP TREATMENT. TWO

02:49:52.015 --> 02:49:54.250
THIRDS OF THEM OF THE MEDI CAL

02:49:54.317 --> 02:49:57.453
BENEFICIARIES --

02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:00.623
WILL NOT QUALIFY.

02:50:00.690 --> 02:50:02.759
FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN OR

02:50:02.825 --> 02:50:04.460
THE COUNTY BASED SERVICES WHICH

02:50:04.527 --> 02:50:06.029
INCLUDE SOME OF THE INTENSIVE

02:50:06.095 --> 02:50:07.764
SERVICES THAT.

02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:08.765
JUST ABOUT ALL OF OUR PATIENTS

02:50:08.831 --> 02:50:10.867

02:50:10.934 --> 02:50:12.168
THAT DON'T QUALIFY DON'T.

02:50:12.235 --> 02:50:14.571
DON'T I GUESS SCORE AS BEING

02:50:14.637 --> 02:50:16.272
SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL ENOUGH TO

02:50:16.339 --> 02:50:17.373
ACCESS THOSE SERVICES.

02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:18.908
WILL NOT.

02:50:18.975 --> 02:50:20.343
THROUGH THE HEALTH PLANS ARE THE

02:50:20.410 --> 02:50:22.445
MANAGED CARE MEDI CAL THE PLANS

02:50:22.512 --> 02:50:24.013
AVAILABLE AS MY DISCHARGE PEOPLE

02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:25.348

INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT SERVICES

AVAILABLE FOR THOSE PATIENTS.

02:50:30.653 --> 02:50:32.522
SO THE COMBINATION OF OF THE

02:50:32.589 --> 02:50:34.357
LACK OF SERVICES AVAILABLE AND

02:50:34.424 --> 02:50:35.425
THEN THE WHETHER THEY CAN

02:50:35.491 --> 02:50:37.060
QUALIFY EVEN QUALIFY FOR THE

02:50:37.126 --> 02:50:38.094

THEY ARE SICK ENOUGH ESSENTIALLY

02:50:44.067 --> 02:50:45.335
FOR THE LEVEL OF CARE.

02:50:45.401 --> 02:50:47.236
SO IN YOUR OPINION AFTER BEING

02:50:47.303 --> 02:50:49.706
RELEASED AFTER SIX TO TEN DAYS

02:50:49.772 --> 02:50:51.841
OF TREATMENT OR THEY THEY WELL

02:50:51.908 --> 02:50:53.710
ENOUGH LET LET ME --

02:50:53.776 --> 02:50:54.978
LET ME JUST GIVE YOU --

02:50:55.044 --> 02:50:58.414
TECH A COUNTERPOINT AND FOR

02:50:58.481 --> 02:50:59.882
KAISER --

02:50:59.949 --> 02:51:01.651
ANTHEM BLUE CROSS AT AND THE

02:51:01.718 --> 02:51:03.052
EXPECTATION IS THAT THEY HAVE AN

02:51:03.119 --> 02:51:05.688
APPOINTMENT WITHIN SEVEN DAYS.

02:51:05.755 --> 02:51:07.590
AND IT'S OFTEN CLOSER TO FIVE

02:51:07.657 --> 02:51:09.525
DAYS FOR SOME FORM OF FOLLOW UP

02:51:09.592 --> 02:51:11.094
CARE MANY ARE REFERRED TO OUR

02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:13.029
OUTPATIENT SERVICES WE DO OFFER

02:51:13.096 --> 02:51:14.897
DAY TREATMENT IOP THERE'S OTHER

02:51:14.964 --> 02:51:16.532
PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO DO.

02:51:16.599 --> 02:51:19.302
PRIVATE PROVIDERS --

02:51:19.369 --> 02:51:21.638
I THINK THAT I DON'T KNOW IF

02:51:21.704 --> 02:51:23.206
THEY'RE WELL ENOUGH OR NOT --

02:51:23.272 --> 02:51:26.309
BUT MY BASED ON A READMISSION

02:51:26.376 --> 02:51:26.943
RATES I WOULD GUESS THAT THEY'RE

02:51:27.010 --> 02:51:28.378
NOT.

02:51:28.444 --> 02:51:30.413
SO WHAT IS THE READMISSION RATES.

02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:32.215
FREEDOM OPULENT XIN.

02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:34.784
WE RUN OVERALL A READMISSION

02:51:34.851 --> 02:51:37.854
RATES OF ABOUT. 10% THERE'S THAT

02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:39.155
WE LOOK AT IT WITHIN THREE DAYS

02:51:39.222 --> 02:51:40.657
IN WITHIN THIRTY DAYS WITHIN

02:51:40.723 --> 02:51:42.091
THREE DAYS IT'S MUCH LOWER THAN

02:51:42.158 --> 02:51:43.726
THAT BUT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS IT

02:51:43.793 --> 02:51:45.194
IT'S IT'LL RUN ABOUT 10%.

02:51:45.261 --> 02:51:48.665
KAISER CONVERSELY WHICH IS --

02:51:48.731 --> 02:51:50.233
YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE IT DOES HAVE

02:51:50.299 --> 02:51:51.267
SOME MEDICARE ON IT THROUGH ITS

02:51:51.334 --> 02:51:52.702
MANAGE BUSINESS BUT ESSENTIALLY

02:51:52.769 --> 02:51:54.537
A NON MEDICARE BOOK OF BUSINESS

02:51:54.604 --> 02:51:55.838
THEIR READMISSION RATES HER.

02:51:55.905 --> 02:52:00.176
OVER THIRTY DAYS MAYBE ONE OR 2%.

02:52:00.243 --> 02:52:01.177
SO THOSE READ MISSIONS ARE

02:52:01.244 --> 02:52:02.211
PRETTY COSTLY.

02:52:02.278 --> 02:52:04.080
I WOULD SAY SO YES.

02:52:04.147 --> 02:52:05.248
AND THAT FROM DOING THE MATH

02:52:05.314 --> 02:52:07.917
HERE THAT'S ROUGHLY THIS

02:52:07.984 --> 02:52:08.785
POPULATION AMERICA PUBLISHES

02:52:08.851 --> 02:52:10.386
ROUGHLY.

02:52:10.453 --> 02:52:12.855
THAT THAT IS RELEASED TWO THIRDS

02:52:12.922 --> 02:52:14.557
THAT THEY CAN'T GET FOLLOW UP

02:52:14.624 --> 02:52:16.225
THAT'S LIKE 25%.

02:52:16.292 --> 02:52:19.595
OF ALL OF YOUR PEOPLE IN A YEAR.

02:52:19.662 --> 02:52:21.864
THAT ARE IT NEEDED A 90% OF

02:52:21.931 --> 02:52:24.300
WHICH ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY SO

02:52:24.367 --> 02:52:25.401
THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY.

02:52:25.468 --> 02:52:26.736
EITHER EPISODICALLY ARE

02:52:26.803 --> 02:52:28.871
CHRONICALLY MEN IN A IN A CRISIS

02:52:28.938 --> 02:52:31.441
YES.

02:52:31.507 --> 02:52:32.775
THE STAGGERING ISN'T THE AND

02:52:32.842 --> 02:52:34.277
YOU'RE JUST ONE HOSPITAL. ONE

02:52:34.343 --> 02:52:40.216
HOSPITAL YES --

02:52:40.283 --> 02:52:42.919
BOB OKAY --

02:52:42.985 --> 02:52:44.387
DOCTOR SEWER --

02:52:44.454 --> 02:52:45.221
ONE OF THE ISSUES WE'VE SEEN IN

02:52:45.288 --> 02:52:47.423
IN NEARLY ALL THE COUNTY MENTAL

02:52:47.490 --> 02:52:48.725
HEALTH PLANS --

02:52:48.791 --> 02:52:49.225
IS THAT THEY'RE HAVING

02:52:49.292 --> 02:52:51.627
DIFFICULTY WITH NETWORK

02:52:51.694 --> 02:52:51.928
[inaudible]

02:52:51.994 --> 02:52:53.930
ADVOCACY --

02:52:53.996 --> 02:52:56.199
FOR ADULT AND CHILD PSYCHIATRY --

02:52:56.265 --> 02:53:00.303
DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON THIS

02:53:00.369 --> 02:53:00.603
[inaudible]

02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:05.208
THERE'S SEVERAL STAGES TO THE

02:53:05.274 --> 02:53:07.510
PROBLEM --

02:53:07.577 --> 02:53:09.312
ONE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE

02:53:09.378 --> 02:53:11.013
SIMPLY WON'T HAPPEN OF

02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:12.215
PSYCHIATRISTS.

02:53:12.281 --> 02:53:13.483
OF I THINK THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE

02:53:13.549 --> 02:53:14.917
OF REPORTS THAT COME OUT OF THE

02:53:14.984 --> 02:53:16.052
LAST COUPLE MONTHS THAT HAVE

02:53:16.119 --> 02:53:19.055
PROJECTED EVEN IF WE GRADUATED.

02:53:19.122 --> 02:53:20.523
YOU KNOW ALL THE PSYCHIATRY

02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:22.058
RESIDENCY SAID AT MAXIMUM

02:53:22.125 --> 02:53:23.826
CAPACITY WE WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:53:23.893 --> 02:53:25.394
PSYCHIATRIST --

02:53:25.461 --> 02:53:26.696

02:53:26.763 --> 02:53:28.498
INITIATIVES LIKE THAT THE T. AND

02:53:28.564 --> 02:53:30.233

TO TRY TO TRAIN PEOPLE WHO.

02:53:34.036 --> 02:53:35.404

MENTAL HEALTH WERE THE PRIMARY

02:53:38.441 --> 02:53:39.675
CARE SETTING --

02:53:39.742 --> 02:53:42.111
SO THAT'S ONE INITIATIVE THAT

02:53:42.178 --> 02:53:44.514
WE'VE DONE --

02:53:44.580 --> 02:53:45.982
AND THEN TRYING TO ATTRACT THE

02:53:46.048 --> 02:53:47.917
PEOPLE THAT WE DO HAVE THAT ARE

02:53:47.984 --> 02:53:50.086

WORK FORCE --

02:53:54.690 --> 02:53:55.925
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A

02:53:55.992 --> 02:53:57.727
LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO OPT

02:53:57.794 --> 02:53:59.629

02:54:05.968 --> 02:54:10.473
STRUCTURES ARE SO CUMBERSOME.

02:54:10.540 --> 02:54:11.407
WE HEARD YESTERDAY IN OUR BUDGET

02:54:11.474 --> 02:54:12.875

NEED TO INCREASE CAPACITY IN

02:54:43.673 --> 02:54:45.274
PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCIES --

02:54:45.341 --> 02:54:47.276

02:55:02.859 --> 02:55:03.960
BILL FLOATING AROUND OUT THERE

02:55:04.026 --> 02:55:04.861

I THANK YOU --

02:55:13.469 --> 02:55:15.838

02:55:15.905 --> 02:55:16.405
FOR MISS A SINGLE MINUTE THE

02:55:16.472 --> 02:55:19.709
TERM -- THIS

02:55:19.775 --> 02:55:21.210
IS A TIME YOU'RE NOT.

02:55:21.277 --> 02:55:23.112
SENDING SOMEONE TO AN MRI OR

02:55:23.179 --> 02:55:25.047
DOING TESTS --

02:55:25.114 --> 02:55:25.648
CERTAINLY AT THE FOUNDATION OF

02:55:25.715 --> 02:55:26.582
ALL.

02:55:26.649 --> 02:55:28.284
MEDICAL HEALTH CARE IS

02:55:28.351 --> 02:55:29.652
COMMUNICATION THAT PARTICULAR

02:55:29.719 --> 02:55:31.420
AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO.

02:55:31.487 --> 02:55:32.722
HE SPEAK TO THE ISSUE ABOUT

02:55:32.788 --> 02:55:35.324
LANGUAGE ACCESS AND MEDICO --

02:55:35.391 --> 02:55:37.293
MENTAL HEALTH --

02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:38.828
THE THE THE DIFFICULT EITHER

02:55:38.895 --> 02:55:40.563
EASE OR DIFFICULTY PATIENTS ARE

02:55:40.630 --> 02:55:41.697
HAVING BECAUSE I AM NOT SURE

02:55:41.764 --> 02:55:43.266
WHAT A MENTAL HEALTH

02:55:43.332 --> 02:55:44.867
PROFESSIONAL DOES.

02:55:44.934 --> 02:55:47.270
IF THEY CAN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE

02:55:47.336 --> 02:55:48.638
OF THE PATIENT AND PATIENTS

02:55:48.704 --> 02:55:50.673
UNDERSTAND SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF

02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:52.108
THE PERSON SEEN THEM.

02:55:52.174 --> 02:55:53.376
YEAH THANK YOU THAT'S A REALLY

02:55:53.442 --> 02:55:54.977
GOOD QUESTION SO I THINK THAT

02:55:55.044 --> 02:55:56.946
THERE'S A COUPLE PIECES TO IT

02:55:57.013 --> 02:55:59.081
WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT SO ONE IS --

02:55:59.148 --> 02:56:00.650
THROUGH THE PHONE CENTERS IN THE

02:56:00.716 --> 02:56:01.884
FIRST PLACE TO THE ACCESS LINES

02:56:01.951 --> 02:56:04.153
I THINK WE'VE SEEN SOME PROBLEMS

02:56:04.220 --> 02:56:04.754
WITH MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE

02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:06.022
INTERPRETERS WERE AVAILABLE ON

02:56:06.088 --> 02:56:07.256
THOSE LINES EVEN TELL PEOPLE

02:56:07.323 --> 02:56:08.024
HERE'S WHERE YOU CAN GO TO GET

02:56:08.090 --> 02:56:09.358
YOUR SERVICES SO THAT WOULD BE

02:56:09.425 --> 02:56:10.359
THE FIRST THING.

02:56:10.426 --> 02:56:11.360
I THINK THE SECOND PIECE IS THE

02:56:11.427 --> 02:56:12.728
ASSESSMENT PIECE THAT I TALKED

02:56:12.795 --> 02:56:14.964
ABOUT EVEN EVEN WHEN WE'RE DOING

02:56:15.031 --> 02:56:16.499
TRANSLATED ASSESSMENTS THEY'RE

02:56:16.565 --> 02:56:18.000
NOT ACCURATELY TRANSLATING AND

02:56:18.067 --> 02:56:18.868
SO.

02:56:18.935 --> 02:56:21.904
SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL REFER TO

02:56:21.971 --> 02:56:25.074
HOW THEY KIND OF HIT THE BAR FOR

02:56:25.141 --> 02:56:26.609
PEOPLE TO QUALIFY FOR SERVICES

02:56:26.676 --> 02:56:27.543
SO THERE'S THAT LANGUAGE ACCESS

02:56:27.610 --> 02:56:29.178
PROBLEM THAT I THINK.

02:56:29.245 --> 02:56:29.979
NEEDS A LOT MORE STUDY IN A LOT

02:56:30.046 --> 02:56:31.480
MORE WORK AND THEN LIKE YOU

02:56:31.547 --> 02:56:33.115
BRING UP THERE'S ONCE YOU IF IF

02:56:33.182 --> 02:56:34.650
AND WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GET INTO

02:56:34.717 --> 02:56:35.952
TREATMENT --

02:56:36.018 --> 02:56:37.119
THERE ISN'T THAT INTRACTABLE AT

02:56:37.186 --> 02:56:38.688
THE CLINICIAN AND YOU KNOW I

02:56:38.754 --> 02:56:39.622
THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THAT

02:56:39.689 --> 02:56:41.057
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS I MEAN WE DO

02:56:41.123 --> 02:56:42.925
FOR A LOT OF AS YOU VERY WHERE

02:56:42.992 --> 02:56:43.859
FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT MEDICAL

02:56:43.926 --> 02:56:44.627
THINGS YOU KNOW WE USED

02:56:44.694 --> 02:56:45.761
INTERPRETER LINE THOSE KINDS OF

02:56:45.828 --> 02:56:46.329
THINGS THAT THEY'RE NOT AS

02:56:46.395 --> 02:56:47.530
EFFECTIVE.

02:56:47.596 --> 02:56:48.698
IN MENTAL HEALTH AND SO THAT WE

02:56:48.764 --> 02:56:49.598
REALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT WORK

02:56:49.665 --> 02:56:50.766
FORCE I THINK NEED TO HAVE A

02:56:50.833 --> 02:56:52.101
PARTICULAR FOCUS IN MENTAL

02:56:52.168 --> 02:56:53.402
HEALTH AND BILINGUAL

02:56:53.469 --> 02:56:55.271
PROFESSIONALS --

02:56:55.338 --> 02:56:58.607
AND IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY WHEN I

02:56:58.674 --> 02:57:00.176
WAS AT UC DAVIS --

02:57:00.242 --> 02:57:01.978
MEMBER BUT WE PILOTED TO

02:57:02.044 --> 02:57:04.013
ACTUALLY TELL A PRETTY BECAUSE

02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:05.481
THE I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST THE

02:57:05.548 --> 02:57:06.682
LANGUAGE --

02:57:06.749 --> 02:57:07.283
YOU MIGHT CATCH THE TONE OF

02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:08.784
VOICE OVER A PHONE LINE WHAT YOU

02:57:08.851 --> 02:57:10.152
DON'T SEE THE BODY LANGUAGE

02:57:10.219 --> 02:57:11.387
FACIAL EXPRESSIONS.

02:57:11.454 --> 02:57:14.223
THAT GIVE NEW WANTS TO WHAT

02:57:14.290 --> 02:57:16.158
THEY'RE SAYING AND REASON --

02:57:16.225 --> 02:57:17.193
WE DON'T RECALL AN INTERPRETERS

02:57:17.259 --> 02:57:18.461
NOT TRANSLATORS IT'S NOT THE

02:57:18.527 --> 02:57:20.096
LITERAL TRANSLATION WE NEED WE

02:57:20.162 --> 02:57:22.331
NEED INTERPRETATION OF WHAT IS

02:57:22.398 --> 02:57:22.798
THE PATIENT TRYING TO

02:57:22.865 --> 02:57:24.433
COMMUNICATE.

02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:26.936
NOT NOT SAY A WORD BY WORD THING --

02:57:27.003 --> 02:57:28.137
AND SO -- TO

02:57:28.204 --> 02:57:29.205
BE EFFECTIVE --

02:57:29.271 --> 02:57:30.840
I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK ALSO

02:57:30.906 --> 02:57:32.408
BEYOND JUST PHONE.

02:57:32.475 --> 02:57:33.876
PHONE LINES AS A WAY TO

02:57:33.943 --> 02:57:37.480
COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE --

02:57:37.546 --> 02:57:38.047
A DOCTOR SO --

02:57:38.114 --> 02:57:38.647
YOUR YEAH I WAS THE RESIDENCY

02:57:38.714 --> 02:57:40.049
DIRECTOR AT UC DAVIS YOU'RE NOT

02:57:40.116 --> 02:57:41.450
RESIDENCY DIRECTOR --

02:57:41.517 --> 02:57:43.619
SO YOU SEE THE TRAINEES --

02:57:43.686 --> 02:57:46.555
WE TALK ABOUT WORK FORCE --

02:57:46.622 --> 02:57:49.325
SO WHEN A TRAINEE GRADUATES AND

02:57:49.392 --> 02:57:50.459
THEY CHOOSE WHAT PATH THEY WANT

02:57:50.526 --> 02:57:52.194
TO TAKE TO PRACTICE AND THEY

02:57:52.261 --> 02:57:54.730
LOOK AT I GUESS WORKING FOR

02:57:54.797 --> 02:57:55.431
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH.

02:57:55.498 --> 02:57:56.999
WELL WHAT DID THEY SEE I MEAN

02:57:57.066 --> 02:57:57.533
COMPARED TO WHAT THE OTHER

02:57:57.600 --> 02:57:59.568
OPTIONS ARE SO WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:57:59.635 --> 02:58:04.106
PIPELINE BUT I KNOW I SEE THAT

02:58:04.173 --> 02:58:05.074
IN THE GRADUATE THE START

02:58:05.141 --> 02:58:05.908
TALKING ABOUT THE CAREER CHOICES

02:58:05.975 --> 02:58:08.744
AND WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM SO --

02:58:08.811 --> 02:58:12.415
AND SO I'D BE CURIOUS TO IS --

02:58:12.481 --> 02:58:13.649
TO THAT PART BECAUSE WE CAN

02:58:13.716 --> 02:58:14.216
STUFF MORE PEOPLE IN THE

02:58:14.283 --> 02:58:15.718
PIPELINE ABOUT SAYING THAT WE

02:58:15.785 --> 02:58:17.553
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BUT IF PEOPLE

02:58:17.620 --> 02:58:19.455
ARE HAVE OTHER OPTIONS AND WE

02:58:19.522 --> 02:58:20.923
CAN'T BE COMPETITIVE --

02:58:20.990 --> 02:58:22.625
THAT'S AN ISSUE AND THEN I THINK

02:58:22.691 --> 02:58:24.026
THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT ONE

02:58:24.093 --> 02:58:25.361
COULD ARGUE THAT GIVEN THEM OUT

02:58:25.428 --> 02:58:26.695
OF OVERHEAD WORK.

02:58:26.762 --> 02:58:27.663
WE COULD PERHAPS INCREASE OUR

02:58:27.730 --> 02:58:30.399
WORKFORCE INSTANTLY BY 20% OR

02:58:30.466 --> 02:58:33.402
25% BY SIMPLY CUTTING THEM OUT

02:58:33.469 --> 02:58:34.770
OF OVERHEAD BY HALF.

02:58:34.837 --> 02:58:36.906
I MEAN SERIOUSLY RIGHT VERSUS A
