ROOM IS ESTABLISHED WE HAVE TWO ITEMS DAY HERE TODAY AND HOPEFULLY BE FAIRLY QUICK I SEE WE HAVE OUR AUTHOR WITH OF A C. R. ONE FIFTEEN ASSEMBLY WOMAN COM LONGER YOU PREPARE TO MAKE THE PRESENTATION. YES FOR HIM. YOUR FOR ME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- HAPPY NEW YEAR TO. ALL OF YOU. ILLUSTRIOUS SENATORS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M HERE TO PRESENT ACR ONE ONE FIVE IT URGES BANKS THAT HAVE OPENED DEMAND ACCOUNTS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S BANK OF AMERICA CITIGROUP JPMORGAN CHASE UNION BANK U. S. BANK CORPS AND WELLS FARGO AMONG OTHERS TO RECONSIDER THEIR LENDING PRACTICES AND STOP LENDING TO GUN MANUFACTURERS IT IS AN ESTIMATED THAT THE UNITED STATES EXPERIENCED APPROXIMATELY ONE MASS SHOOTING EVERY FIFTEEN DAYS AND TWENTY NINETEEN. I SHOOTING IN GILROY WAS FELT BY ANY THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY BUT PARTICULARLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE LAST SESSION ENDED WE EXPERIENCED ANOTHER MASS SHOOTING. IN FRESNO WHICH LEFT FOUR KILLED AND SIX INJURED. AND SO FAR THIS YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN EIGHT INCIDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH FOUR OR MORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT. WE SHOULD ALL BE COMMITTED TO ENDING GUN VIOLENCE AND TO DO SO WE SHOULD ACT ON MULTIPLE FRONTS. WE MUST LOOK AT OUR HABITS PRACTICES AND EFFORTS AS CONSUMERS AND AS PROVIDERS TO SEE HOW WE SHARE A PART OF THE COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC. PUBLIC DISCOURSE REGARDING GUN VIOLENCE OFTEN FOCUSES ON THE DEMAND FACTOR THIS RESOLUTION INSTEAD AIMS TO SHIFT DISCORD TOWARDS THE PLY. OTHER INDUSTRIES HAVE TAKEN A STAND AGAINST GUN MANUFACTURERS DELTA AIRLINES AND HURTS BROKE WITH THE NRA FOLLOWING THE PARKLAND FLORIDA SHOOTING JUST LAST YEAR DICK'S SPORTING GOODS STOP SELLING GUNS AND AMMUNITION AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE OF THEIR STORES. THIS RESOLUTION IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BANKING INDUSTRY TO DO MORE WHILE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BANKS AND GUN MANUFACTURERS ARE LEGAL WE SHOULD ASK. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT LINDA GUN MANUFACTURERS GIVEN THE PRESENT GUN MASHING CRISIS OCCURRING IN OUR COUNTRY IF THEY CAN DO MORE. CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS A STRONG HISTORY OF MAKING VALUE BASED DECISIONS AGAINST BANKS USING DIVESTMENT AS A SOCIAL ACTION TOOL AFTER YEARS OF PROTEST THE UC REGENTS VOTED IN EIGHTY SIX TO DIVEST THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS FROM COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS WITH THE APARTHEID GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA. IT WAS THE LARGEST UNIVERSITY DIVESTMENT IN THE COUNTRY AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE STATE SUSPENDED RELATIONS WITH WELLS FARGO FOLLOWING THEIR ACCOUNT FRAUD SCANDAL. THE STATE TREASURER REMOVED WELLS FARGO AS A BOOK RUNNER ONTO MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUING SUSPENDED INVESTMENTS WITH THE BANK AND REMOVE THE BANK AS THE STATE'S BROKER DEALER THIS SUSPENSION LASTED TWO YEARS. AND THEN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA CITIES DIVESTED FROM BANKS AND BUSINESSES INVOLVED IN FOSSIL FUEL PROJECTS SUCH AS PIPELINES AND TAR SANDS. SOME BANKS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN ACT SIMILAR TO ACR ONE FIFTEEN FOR INSTANCE CITY BANK BAND RETAILERS USING THEIR SERVICES FROM OFFERING ON STOCKS AND SELLING GUNS TO ITS CONSUMERS. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT PASSED BACK AND CHECK IN BANG ERICA THEN CAME OUT WITH A SET OF RESTRICTIONS ENDING LOANS TO COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE ASSAULT WEAPONS. USED FOR NON TERRY PURPOSES. THESE EXAMPLES SHOW THAT BANKS CAN BE GUIDED BY THE PUBLIC COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS. THIS RESOLUTION ENCOURAGES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO REEVALUATE THEIR LENDING PRACTICES PARTICULARLY AS THEY APPLY TO GUN MANUFACTURERS.
