WHO ARE SOME OF THE MOST RESILIENT AND AMAZING PARENTS AT RENOWN I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU ONE OF THEIR STORIES AND WHY EIGHTY SIX SEVENTY IS. SO IMPORTANT. IN FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN AT AGE SEVENTEEN. MY CLIENT TWO CHILDREN WERE DETAINED AND PLAY FOR THE PATERNAL GREAT GRANDMOTHER. AFTER A VERY HIGHLY CONTESTED HEARING. SHE WENT INTO A VERY DIFFICULT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS DEGREE INDICATION SERVICES. DUE IN LARGE PART TO HER STABILITY WHICH ARE SOME OF THE REASONS WHY HER CASE CAME IN AFTER THE PENDANT. SHE WAS UNABLE TO REUNIFY AND THE CHILDREN WENT INTO PERMANENTLY PLANNING A FAMILY. ALTHOUGH DURING THIS TIME SHE MAINTAINED A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH OF HER CHILDREN. THREE YEARS LATER AT AGE TWENTY WHILE SHE WAS STILL A NON MINOR CONTENDED. SHE HAD A NEW BABY THAT WILL BE PAINTED BURKE. DURING THE TIME SHE WAS BRIEFLY INCARCERATED AND MADE APPROPRIATE PLANS BUT DUE TO THE DEPARTMENT AFFECTING HER HIGH WITH THE HARD. BECAUSE OF THE PREVIOUS HISTORY AND WALTER CURRENT INCARCERATION. THE RECOMMENDATION WAS AND NOT PROVIDE HER WITH FAMILY REUNIFICATION THIRD OF THE THIRD CHILD. THEY DID NOT AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY OF THE CHANGES THAT SHE HAD MADE. AFTER THREE YEARS AND A LOT OF GROWTH INCLUDING PARTICIPATING IN THIRD BALLING HARD RATED AFTER HER RELEASE. SHE WAS NOT ONLY ABLE TO REUNIFY WITH THE THIRD CHILD AFTER A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE DIVISION HEARING SEVERAL MONTHS LATER. HE ACTUALLY CLOSED EXCESSIVELY. WITH NO CONCERN SIX MONTHS LATER. TODAY MY CLIENT HAD ALL. SUCCESSFULLY FOR A MOTION AND RE. WITH THE FOLDER TO CHILL THAT WOULD. AND TWENTY SEVEN. THE DEPARTMENT INITIALLY RECOMMENDED ADOPTION OF THE TWO CHILDREN. NOT BELIEVING THAT SHE EVER WOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PARIS AND SAFELY. BUT NOW ALL THREE CHILDREN IN HER CARE AND BRIBING. SHE STABLE. WORKING IN SCHOOL AND PROVIDING A LOVING HOME FOR ALL THREE OF HER CHILDREN. WHO ARE NOW ABLE TO PROVIDE WE'RE NOW AT A LIVE IN A HOME TOGETHER ACTIVELY. IT'S A SOCIAL WORKER IN THE DEPARTMENT INITIAL RECOMMENDATION OF NO FAMILY REUNIFICATION GRANTED. ALL THREE OF THESE CHILDREN WERE NOT OF THE TURN HOME AND NONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY KILL THE TRAUMA. OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE VERY YOUNG FAMILY AND NOW ALL THREE OF THEM ARE TOGETHER WITH THEIR MOTHERS THE PLATE. AND WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT IN OCTOBER HER CAPABLE TO BE OLDER TWO CHILDREN BOB. DOLE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT OUR YOUNG CHARACTER BASIC AND- IF YOU'RE- THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER CHILDREN THE CHANGES ARE. BUT SHOULD NOT BE HELD AGAINST HER THREE YEARS LATER ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE RELATED TO THE VERY REASON FOR KATE COMING FOR THE KIDS. TO GET WET. ADDITIONALLY HER PRIOR BECAUSE THE HISTORY OF THE MINOR SHOULD NOT. BE CONSIDERED A RED. THE REASON THAT SHE CAME TO THE SYSTEM ONE IS USED AGAINST HER AT THE PARENT AND THE COMPLETE JACK ARE MINOR. AND MODERATE. THE GROWTH THAT PLACE BETWEEN A TEENAGE YEARS AND YOUNG ADULT YEARS BUT SIGNIFICANT AND IS BILL TO GIVE ALL OF OUR YOUNG PARENTS A CHANCE TO SHOW THE WORLD. AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN WALLET KNOWLEDGE IN CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO HELP STOP THE GENERATIONAL CYCLE THE FOSTER CARE.

HELLO ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE WE ARE- READY FOR YOU TO PRESENT AB EIGHT ZERO EIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOETTICHER MEMBERS EIGHTY EIGHT OH EIGHT IS. HEY CONTINUATION OF A LOT OF WORK THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS LOOK AT THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM HAND TRYING TO. ENSURE THAT WE ARE. LOOKING TOWARDS THE SUCCESS OF THE KIDS IN THE SYSTEM. AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PLACEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE AND THE CONTINUING CARE REFORM REALLY HAD FOCUSED ON S. TEEPEES AND THERAPEUTIC TYPE PLACE WITH BUT ONE OF THE GAPS. THAT WE HAVE HAD IN THE SYSTEM OR SOME OF THE KIDS WERE SEEN AS THE HARDEST TO SERVE THAT HAVE NEEDS BEYOND WHAT HAS BEEN IN THE STATE. SO THE STATE HAS IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE TO CERTIFY PROGRAMS OUT OF STATE TO SEND KIDS THAT THEY DIDN'T FEEL WERE. ABLE TO BE SERVING CALIFORNIA. BUT SYSTEM KINDA CAME CRASHING DOWN LAST FALL WHEN THE STATE DECERTIFIED ALL OF THOSE OUT OF STATE FACILITIES BROUGHT THE KIDS HOME. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH EIGHT OH EIGHT. IS COULD CREATE THAT CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAPABILITY TO SERVE ALL OF OUR KIDS NOW THIS IS. ENDED UP BEING A VERY COMPLEX SITUATION. AND BETTER TRY IT REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF YOUR COMMITTEE HAS DONE. A SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR AMENDMENTS. THAT ARE LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND THE ONGOING WORK. TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE FUNDING. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE WHAT AB EIGHT EIGHT AWAIT REPRESENTS AND WHAT IT REPRESENTS. IS A HIGHLY ESSENTIALLY SORT OF PILOTS TO PROVIDE SOME VERY HIGHLY TAILORED INDIVIDUALIZED SERVICE FOR SEVENTIES HIGH NEEDS KIDS BUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE OFFERING IN HERE THAT THAT WE'RE TAKING. DON'T JUST DO THE PILOT FOR THE HIGH NEED KIDS BUT ALL THE OTHER COMPONENTS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE KIDS ARE NOT. GOING TO BE PLACED IN THESE. MORE RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS IN THESE HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED SETTINGS. WITHOUT A PLACE TO GO SO THAT WE STEP DOWN AND STEP AWAY FROM. THESE MUCH MORE INTENSE SERVICES BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS ARE HEADED TOWARDS FAMILY TYPE PLACEMENTS WITH RESOURCE FAMILIES AND IN PLACEMENTS THAT THAT SERVE THEIR INTEREST THE BEST BUT SOMETIMES WE NEED TO GET THEM READY. SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT AB EIGHT EIGHT AWAIT IS ABOUT IT'S ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM THAT HAPPENED WHEN WE HAD THE DECERTIFY KIDS AND THE FACT THAT WE SEND KIDS OUT OF STATE. AT TIMES WHEN WE PROBABLY SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT BECAUSE THE CLOSER KIDS ARE HOME. THE BETTER THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE MORE. THE INDIVIDUALIZED PLACEMENT AND THE THERAPEUTIC SETTING WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ALL THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. THE MORE THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN. INTENSELY IF NECESSARY AND THEN STEP DOWN AND STEP AWAY FROM THOSE MORE. RESTRICTIVE INTENSIVE ENVIRONMENTS INTO INDIVIDUALIZED PLACEMENTS INTO A MORE FAMILY LIKE SETTING. IS FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THOSE CHILDREN. THAT'S WHAT AB EIGHT WAYS TO IT WERE ALSO TRACKING LANGUAGE THROUGH BUDGET TRAILER AND TALK WITH THE BUDGET COMMITTEES AND A LOT OF FOLKS TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN FORM TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM. TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER FOR OUTCOMES FOR KIDS THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT TAKE A LOT OF AMENDMENTS THAT A LOT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER ASKED US TO TAKE IN THIS OF THE CONCERNS THAT THEY'VE BEEN RAISING OVER THE TIME REALLY ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE. THE RIGHT KIND OF REPORTING AND FEEDBACK ON THE SYSTEMS SO THE KIDS ARE NOT GETTING LOST WITHIN THE SYSTEM. WE'RE ALSO ADDING A MORATORIUM. IN THIS BILL ON SENDING KIDS OUT OF STATE ON IT IT'S A MORATORIUM ON. THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO CERTIFY AT THE STATE PLACEMENTS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT HERE. ARE THERE IS SOMETHING ACTUALLY THAT THE SENATE HAS BEEN ASKING US TO DO SENATE BUDGET HAS BEEN ASKING US TO DO WE AGREED TO PUT THAT IN HERE. AND I KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WHO IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS. IS NOT HAPPY WITH A MORATORIUM AND I THINK THEY WILL ADDRESS THAT COUNTY SAN EARLY WHEN SHE TALKS WILL WILL ADDRESS THAT. I'M FINE WITH THE MORATORIUM BECAUSE IT MAKES IT PRETTY CLEAR STATEMENT. THAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP THIS CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA. TO THE BEST EXTENT THAT WE CAN. I THINK THE COUNTIES ARE APPROPRIATELY CONCERNED RIGHT NOW. THAT AS WE DEVELOP THE PILOT. WHICH IS MEANT TO BE. THE REPLACEMENT FOR THE OT OF STATE. PLACEMENTS AS WE DEVELOP THAT PILOT. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THE NEED. TO SERVE THESE KIDS WE MIGHT HAVE TO BE SENDING SOME OF THEM. OUT OF STATE AND I THINK THAT IS. I UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERN AT THIS POINT. BUT I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON US. TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN O KEEP THOSE KIDS IN STATE. DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO SERVE THEM. AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL POSSIBLE. WITH APPROPRIATE SERVICES INCLUDING THE MENTAL HEALTH PORTION. AND I WILL ADMIT THAT THAT MENTAL HEALTH PORTION WAS WHAT WE STRUGGLED WITH WITH THE CONTINUED CARE REFORM IS GETTING THAT PIECE PUT IN. BECAUSE THE NOTION WAS THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. WE WERE INSTEAD OF. PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AFTER DIAGNOSIS IN DOWN THE ROAD WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WILL PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES UP FRONT FOR THESE KIDS. BECAUSE EVERY KID COMING INTO CONTACT. WITH AN AGENCY OR WITH A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. IS SUBJECT TO TRAUMA AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES IN ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT. THAT SHOULD LEAD US TO MAKE IT NATURAL THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THEM. AND YET WE HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THAT THAT'S PART AND PARCEL TO THIS TO THE- WHAT THE- PILOT IS FAR. LIKE STA RT PEAS BUT MAYBE FOR ONE. AND THEY ARE CO JOINED WITH SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHICH FOR. NOW SO A FOCUS OF THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING. AND IF WE CAN HELP THOSE KIDS IN THAT SITUATION. WE CAN DEVELOP THAT KEPT CAPACITY BETTER IN CALIFORNIA ENSURE THAT WE HAVE PLACEMENTS HERE. THAT'S WHAT AB EIGHT AWAIT IS ABOUT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION THAT WE FOUND LAST FALL WHEN THE STATE HAD TO DECERTIFY ALL OF THOSE OUT OF STATE PROGRAMS. AND BUILDING THAT CAPACITY HERE. NOW IF THROUGH THE BUDGET MAKING APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS. IN THOSE KIDS IN THOSE PROGRAMS GETTING THEM STABLE GETTING THEM ABLE TO BE SENT OUT TO RESOURCE FAMILIES AND THEY'RE ALSO COMPONENTS WITH THIS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. TWO GROW OUR ABILITY CALIFORNIA TO RETAIN RECRUIT. AND BRING THESE RESOURCE FAMILIES. INTO OUR COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT CAPACITY ACROSS THE STATE. SO THAT THE HOT AND I KNOW THAT HE VETO IT IS A LOT BUT IT IS LONG PAST TIME WE ADDRESS THIS IN CALIFORNIA. AND BECAUSETHERE'S MONEY IN THE BUDGET IN BECAUSE WERE WE HAD THE NEED TO DE CERTIFY ALL OF THOSE OUT OF STATE IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS. MAKE SURE THOSE KIDS ARE NOT SENT OUT OF STATE. MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS IN THESE OUR DEPENDENCY KIDS. AND DELINQUENCY KIDS USER ANY KID HOW IDEALLY WHO NEEDS THE SERVICES OF PROTECTION AND HELP. THAT'S WHAT EIGHT AWAIT IS ABOUT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ITEMS. AT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AYE WE- I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THAT THE PASSION YOU HAVE FOR- FOR OUR FOSTER YOUTH AND YOU CAN TELL IN YOUR IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS- JUST TALK DEEPLY CARE ABOUT THIS BUT- I TYPED APPRECIATE THAT BUT FULHAM.

THIS NEW CONTINUES TO SERVE- THERE'S YOU PROVIDE THE CRITICAL SAFEGUARD NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT FOSTER YOU ARE PROTECTED CAPSAICIN HAVE THEIR NEEDS MET APPROPRIATELY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CERTIFICATION WE ACT LIKE THAT IS THAT WAS JUST A FORMAL TECHNICAL THING MORE. TWO DECADES OR MORE CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED GAMBLE AFTER SCANDAL OUT OF STATE FACILITIES AND THE CERTIFICATION WHILE THE- RESULT OF THE REVIEWING THOSE FACILITIES. AND FINDING THAT. WILL BE DID NOT MEET OUR STATE FOR CARE OF CHILDREN THANK WITH ALL THESE WERE NOT SAFE OUR CHILDREN AND THE FACT THAT WOULD BE THE OUT OF STATE AND SO FAR AWAY IN THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SO FAR AWAY FROM FAMILIES AND PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW. IT DEMONSTRATED OVER THE LAST TWO TO THREE DECADES THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO POSITION WE PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. MORATORIUM IS NECESSARY TO NOT ONLY BE CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPRESS INTENT OF THE GOAL TO PREVENT OUT OF STATE PLATES THAT HISTOLOGICAL. AND NECESSARY COUNTERPOINT. BY A SPECIAL INTO SERVICES WITH THE TO BUY TO MEET THE OF ITS POP. OF FOSTER YOUTH KNOW THE FATHER YOU WITH HIGH ACUITY TO PREVIOUS WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT OUT OF STATE. YOU ARE ONE FACILITIES THE SENSOR OF FRIDAY YOU- MAY THERE MAY BEEN PROP WITH- FINDING APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS AND MEANING THE NEEDS OF THOSE YOU'D APPROPRIATELYBECAUSE OF THE SHORT TIME FRAME THAT YOU- CERTIFICATION IN TERMS OF BRINGING YOU BACK QUICKLY. BUT THESE ARE ALL SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY- CURRENTLY CANDIA PROVIDED TO YOU IN THE STATE. ARE IT IS THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY DEVELOPED THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DEVELOP THOSE SERVICES SO THERE'S NO NEED TO ALLOW FACILITIES ONCE AGAIN TO BAMBOOZLE CALIFORNIA INTO THINKING THAT WE ARE PROVIDING SOME MEDICAL SERVICES. TO MEET HIS NEEDS ARE WHEN IN FACT WHAT THEY DO AND GAUGING THE VIEWS THE PRACTICES AND DON'T PROVIDE ANY SERVICES THAT MEET. THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE OTHER THAN BEING THE NEEDS TO BE A DOLPHIN THE SYSTEM TO PLAY FROM FAR AWAY AND HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY LOCKED AWAY- WHERE. THEY CAN'T.

IN RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS IN STATE PROVIDING TRANSITION SUPPORTS TO KEEP YOU CAN FAMILY SETTING. THANK YOU SO MUCH SO I WILL CLOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND AT THIS MOMENT WILL MOVE ON TO A PUBLIC COMMENT IN OPPOSITION- BEGINNING A ROOM FORTY TWO ZERO THREE SEE NON- WILL MOVE ON TO ROUTE TWENTY FORTY WE HAVE NUMBER AS WELL. I WILL OPEN UP THE TELEPHONE A PUBLIC COMMENT LINE FOR THOSE WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND JUST A REMINDER UP TO STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION A POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY. THANK YOU. IF YOU WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AGAIN ONE ZERO FOR OPPOSITION. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO ONE IN OUR QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE ONCE AGAIN FOR- REALLY HIS YEARS OF WORK TO BUILD COULD OF WITH THE WHILE SYSTEM THAT IS FOR. TO THE NEEDS THE SYSTEM INVOLVED CHILDREN- THANK TO HIS LEADERSHIP THIS AS OF ALL THE WAY CON PLACE AND TORE MORE FOR. BASED STUDY. WE NOW HAVE A OF OUT OF PLACE OPTIONS DIDN'T MEET THE RANGE OF NEEDS BY SYSTEM INVOLVED. HOWEVER THE KERN STRUCTURE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SOME CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX MENTAL OR BEFORE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND IN THE PAST SOME COUNTIES HAVE RELIED ON OUT OF STATE PLACEMENTS FOR THESE CHILDREN AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED- SHOCKING REPORTS OF CHILDREN. A CHILD. MULCH AND EVEN THE DEATH OF THE CHILD. AND THESE ARE THE STATE PLACEMENTS HAS RAISED ALARMS THROUGHOUT THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. IN RESPONSE A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT FOSTER CHILDREN WHO WERE PLACED IN OUT OF STATE FACILITIES HAVE RETURNED. TO CALIFORNIA AN NOW HAVE IN STATE PLACEMENTS. THUS WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO FOSTER CHILDREN PLACED IN OUT OF STATE GROUP HOMES. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO FURTHER EXPAND IN STATE PLACEMENT OPTIONS BY CREATING NEW SPECIALIZED FOSTER HOMES AND A- AND A CHILDREN'S CRISIS CONTINUE A PILOT PROGRAM INTENDED TO MEET THE COMPLEX- MENTAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THOSE FOSTER YOUTH. AT AND COUNTIES TO HAVE THE GREATEST CHALLENGE CHALLENGES PLACING. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WILL CREATE A MORATORIUM ON OUT OF STATE PLACEMENTS AS IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE OUR MOST WINNABLE CHILDREN ARE. NO LONGER PLACED IN HARM'S WAY WILL IN FACILITIES ARE. THAT ARE FAR AWAY FROM THE A PROTECTIONS CREATED FOR AND STATE PLACEMENT I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE OPPOSITION TO THE- COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE THE COUNTIES CONCERNS. THAT MORE TIME IS NEEDED BEFORE OUT OF STATE PLACEMENTS CAN BE STOPPED I CONTINUED TO FEEL AS- THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE- THAT I CANNOT SUPPORT ANY PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN IN OUT OF STATE CARE IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THESE YOUTH AND THEREFORE WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AND ALSO- LIKE TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. OUR COMMITTEE- MEMBERS TO PROVIDE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL AND- I HAVE AT THIS TIME. SENATE QUARTERS HE AND THEN FOLLOWED BY CENTER PATH. AND THEN CENTER COME. ON EARTH. THANK YOU IN I'M SURE AND- THANK YOU OFFER FREE LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA- MUCH APPRECIATED I. AM SUPPORTIVE AND I AND I UNDERSTAND- THE ISSUES- AROUND OUR STATE PLACEMENT IN THE ATTEMPT TO CORRECT THE ERROR. I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE A BILL. IT WAS IN WOULD HELP OTHER- WHAT I WOULD CALL KIND OF CASCADING EFFECT ON THE CONTINUUM. IN MY RECENT EXPERIENCE APART FROM THE SENATE- INFORMED ME THAT THE EARLY- DAYS ON THE CONTINUUM IN TERMS OF PLACEMENT- ARE ARE PROBLEMATIC AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD BRIEFLY INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT THIS BILL WILL NOT THIS BILL BECAUSE OF A SPECIALIZED- THE SPECIALIZED. DEVELOPMENT A SPECIALIZED FOSTER CARE BASEMENT- IF IT'S IF IT'S YOUR INTENT OR YOUR YOUR VISION WITH THIS BILL THAT THAT WILL HELP ON THE FRONT END OF THE PLACEMENT PROCESS AS AS KIDS ARE- ESSENTIALLY TAKING HIM. AT INTAKE- IT IS IT IS AGAIN MY EXPERIENCE THAT THOSE EARLY DAYS- OFTENTIMES TURN INTO MORE THAN DAYS AND IT TURNED INTO A PROBLEMATIC PERIOD ON THE CONTINUE- YES SHORT ANSWERS. YES OR NO WHETHER OR NOT IT'S THE INTENT OF THE BILL THE IMPACT THAT IS FINE AND IT IS IT IS. BUT REALIZED THAT THEY CONSIST WHAT WE STRUGGLE WITH WITH CONTINUE IT WAS WAS IT WAS DESIGNED FOR TO CREATE A THERAPEUTIC LEVEL. WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES UP FRONT AND THAT'S BEEN THE STRUGGLE AND A LOT OF THIS TIER T. P.'S. WORKS TAKING SOME OF THE KIDS WITH HIGH SECURITY. AND THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THEM WERE LED TO THE COUNTIES WERE TRYING TO FIND PLACEMENTS FOR THEM. AND WE'RE SENDING THEM OUT OF STATE REMEMBER THE OUT OF STATE FACILITIES ARE NOT LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEIR LICENSE BY THEIR HOME STATE. THEY'RE JUST CERTIFIED BY THE STATE THANK AND CURRENTLY THERE ANDBELIEVE THERE ARE NO CERTIFIED OUT OF STATE. PLACEMENTS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT PRECLUDES SHORT THE MORATORIUM THE STATE FROM LICENSING THEM. SO WHAT WE FOUND WAS AN INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND ESTHER TO SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC. PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTIES NOT ALWAYS WILLING TO TAKE SOME OF THE KIDS WITH THE HIGH SECURITY. SO YES S. KIDS COME IN IF THEY'RE EXHIBITING THOSE HI CUTIE CHALLENGES. THERE WAS A STRUGGLE LOCALLY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO PLACE THEM THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS. BUT TEY'RE STILL WILL REMAIN SOME CHALLENGES ON GOING AND I HAVE ANOTHER BILL THAT'S MOVING THROUGH WE'RE WE'RE CONTINUALLY WORKING. ON ON THE DRESSING IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES WITH THE CONTAINMENT CARE REFORM. IN LESS CONTROVERSIAL SETTINGS THIS IS A THIS IS A MAJOR STEP SO YES IT IS INTENDED TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT WE THAT WE HAVE A BROADER RANGE OF PLACEMENTS FOR KIDS. ESPECIALLY ONES THAT HAVE BEEN HARDER TO PLACE. AS THEY WERE IDENTIFIED AND BROUGHT IN BROUGHT INTO THE SYSTEM BOTH DEPENDENCY AND DELINQUENCY MORE TRYING TO FIND PLACES. FOR KIDS TO GO. THAT SERVE THEIR NEEDS SO THIS IS A MISSING COMPONENT THIS IS A GAP THAT I THINK WAS GOING TO BE SHOWN WITH THE GAPS ANALYSIS THAT THAT. DEPARTMENT WAS DOING BUT IS LATE IN PROVIDING- WE'RE JUST. TIMELINE'S MOVED UP BECAUSE THE SITUATION WE FOUND OURSELVES IN WITH THE DECERTIFICATION SO YEAH THIS IS INTENDED. TO HELP WITH THAT BUT AS A COMPLETE ANSWER NO WE ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE WITH IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND CONTINUE TO AND THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT A BAD THING. BECAUSE ANY SYSTEM IT'S LARGER COMPLEXES THIS IF WE'RE NOT CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT TAKING FEEDBACK. LOOKING AT DATA LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE KIDS THEN WE'RE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES IN THE SAME SITUATION OF A REFORM THAT NEEDED TO BE REFORMED BECAUSE KIDS WILL BE DROPPING TO THE CRACK. SO IT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AND THEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THE COMMITTEE. AND TO BUDGET STAFF AND ALL THESE OTHER PLAYERS IS NOT JUST THE PILOT BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE THE PILOT. AND THIS IS WHERE THE YOUTH LAWCENTERIS TALKING ABOUT. THAT WHAT THEY WERE ALARMED ABOUT. HOPE IT LEASE IT WHAT WE DO IS THE PILOT. AND THERE'S NO PLACE TO TAKE THESE HIGH ACUITY KIDS AND STEP THEM DOWN INTO BETTER PLACEMENTS THAT ARE SERVING THEIR NEEDS. THEN WE HAVE RESTRICTIVE AND WE HAVE LESS RESTRICTIVE AND THERE'S JUST NO BROADER PLAN. SO THAT'S WHY THIS HAS BECOME COMPLEX. BUT IT NEEDS TO BE COMPLEX OTHERWISE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SERVING ALL THE KIDS. SO WHAT BABY MORE LOOKING FOR IN THAT BUT YEAH THIS IS NOT AN EASY THING BUT WE HAVE SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY NOW HERE TO CLOSE SOME OF THESE GAPS. AND A LOOK AT KIDS AT THE HIGHER AND GET THEM THE SERVICES THEY NEED AND WHAT THE IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS IS. IS IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THAT HIGH. ACUITY SERVICE LEVEL. THAT WITHIN STEPPING THEM DOWN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT THEY'RE- ADDRESSING WHATEVER IT IS THEY NEED TO ADDRESS. AND WE'RE KEEPING THEM OUT OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE AND THE MOST INTENSIVE SITUATIONS WHICH IN WHICH IS GOOD FOR THEM TO START OFF WITH THE HELP BUT NOT GOOD FOR THEM LONG TERM. THANK YOU YOUR I APPRECIATED THE RESPONSE THANK YOU MARIA THE COMMISSION. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER PATH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ST RIVER- STONE THAT FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS WORKERS FOR MANY YEARS ON THE- THE FORMS KHATOON CARE REFORMS AND- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH- WITH WITH THIS BILL- AND- FRANKLY I DO AGREE WITH THE- MORATORIUM IT'S A CHALLENGE BUT- FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE ANY OTHER STATE DOES IT ANY BETTER AND SO BY SIMPLY SHIPPING THEM OUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND. BECAUSE AND I THINK WE FOUND OUT AS WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON YOU DON'T REALLY DOING ANY BETTER NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE DOING THAT WE COULDN'T DO BETTER ALSO AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD THE CAPACITY INCLUDING THE PILOTS. I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS THAT- ULTIMATELY- I'M- ASSUMING THAT THE PILOTS OR SUCCESSFUL OR THAT. ANY AT SOME POINT TIME WE'VE HAD- PEOPLE. DO SO THAT'S WHY. I'M A PEDIATRICIAN I TOOK CARE OF THE CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL ISSUES- INCLUDING MANY FOSTER CHILDREN AND- SOME OF THEM CAN BE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. RIGHT THERE IN SITUATIONS AND- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO KEEP SOME OF THE LATE LEAST RESTRICTIVE. AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE NO AT LEAST A CERTAIN POINTS IN TIME AND- BEHAVIOR ORDER SECURE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY REALLY DO NEED INTENSIVE. CARE AND- SO SOUNDS LIKE WHAT WE DID IS THAT WE SAID WELL YOU KNOW WHAT. IF THERE'S- THE REALLY INTENSIVE. WE'RE NAMING IT TAKE THEM INTO OUR OWN STR DURING OUR OWN SHORT TERM STR T. P.'S RIGHT. WHAT'S GONNA SHIP THEM OUT SOMEWHERE. HER EIGHT AND NOW WILL SAY YOU CAN'T DO THAT. IT YOU DO YOU THINK WE TOOK WHERE ACTUALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE GONNA SAY YOU KNOW NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT THEY ARE. GONNA FIND A WAY TAKE CARE OF THEM SOMETIMES THE RESULTS ARE YOU KNOW THEY TAKE TIME IT'S YOUNG IT'S NOT THERE'S NO MAGIC BULLET TO KNOW TREATING SOMEONE THAT'S ONLY TAKES A CHILD TO. HAVE GIVEN A CERTAIN SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE TRAUMA THE EXPERIENCE IN THE MIDDLE HEALTH ISSUES THAT. EVEN WITH THE BEST OF CARE THAT THEY'RE INSTANTLY EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE PERFECTLY FINE FOR THEM RIGHT AT THAT. TREATMENT TAKES TIME IT TAKES EFFORT. EVEN WITH A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF HIS SUCCESSOR STILL FRACTION AND AREN'T SO SUCCESSFUL- THAT BUT I ALSO SORT OF YOU AND YOU PLEASE CORRECT ME IF YOU THINK THAT YOU THINK FEEL DIFFERENTLY OR THINK I'M WRONG. IS THAT TO CERTAIN EXTENT PART OF THE REASON WE GOT TO WHERE WE GOTTEN AND WHAT YOUR AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOMEONE ADDRESSING THE BILL IS THAT. OF THE ONE WHO REALLY NEED INTENSIVE CARE WE'RE- WE'RE WE'RE ALMOST A LITTLE FRAYED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS OKAY FINE WE'LL REFER THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HERE. AND AND I ALSO APPRECIATE WITH THE PILOT THAT STILL DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THEM- BUT HOPEFULLY- WE CAN GET TO THAT PLACE- BUT- TO I GUESS AND THEN TRY TO QUESTIONS THAT RATE CLEAR BUT AT SOME SOME POINT TIME WE HAVE TO SAY IS A SYSTEM- WE- MATTER HOW. DIFFICULT IT MAY BE TO TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE D. THEFT AT THAT AT A PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE AGAIN AND AGREE WITH THE HELP DESK BUT YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S- THAT. WITH THAT WE DON'T JUST SHIP THEM OUT SOMEWHERE WE HAVE TO SOMEHOW ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY AND SAY YES WE'RE GOING TO JUST DO THE BEST WE CAN. TO TAKE CARE OF THEM DOES THAT MAKE SENSE- ARE TODAY HE DOES IT YEAH. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOING. THAT IT'S A PILOT FOR A COUPLE REASONS. ONE OF WHICH SAID THIS THIS IS. DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS THIS IS A SECRET. WHAT ARE THE REASONS THAT THE PILOT IS BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING THROUGH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEY LIKE PILOTS NOT PERMITTED SETTING THE OTHER REASONS PILOT. IS TO ENSURE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE RECOGNIZE. THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO FEED. THE NEED TO BE TESTING AND ENSURING THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING. WORKS BECAUSE WE JUST SET SOMETHING UP AND SAY WE'RE DONE RIGHT THERE'S NO. THERE'S NONE OF THAT ACCOUNTABILITY THERE'S NONE OF THAT MAKING SURE WE DID THE RIGHT THING. AND IF THIS IS GOING TO MORPH OVER TIME I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING IN THIS CASE BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT WE'RE LISTENING TO OURSELVES AND WE'RE LOOKING WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE. GREAT SO THAT'S KIND OF WHY. WE TALKED ABOUT IT IT IT SORT OF SEEMS A PILOT BUT IT IS THIS WORKS YEAH WE'RE LOOKING AT. INTENSIVE SERVICES BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT CAPACITY WE DID JUST SEND THEM OUT AND BECAUSE WE JUST WE WEREN'T ABLE TO SERVE THEM HERE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE WILLINGNESS AND A LOT OF THOSE OTHER COMPONENTS WORK MORE QUITE WORKING THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. THERE WERE NOT ABOUT THAT MANY KIDS THAT NEED THAT HELLO HIGH LEVELS OF SERVICES AND ONE OF MY FEARS. IS THAT IF WE CREATE. THESE BETS THE- THERE ARE HIGH LEVEL BEDS THAT ARE EXPENSIVE. THEN WE CREATE THE DESIRE TO CONTINUE TO FILL THEM ALL THE TIME. WELL THAT'S OVER KILLING WE'RE PUTTING KIDS IN SITUATIONS THEY DON'T NEED THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THEM. IF WE SET IT UP WITH THE STEP DOWNS IN THIS CONCERT REVIEW. THEN THE SYSTEM IS REALLY SET UP TO TEN NOT NECESSARILY FILL THOSE BEDS BUT MAKE SURE WERE. APPROPRIATELY PLACING KIDS SO THOSE KIDS WHO NEED LONGER SERVICES. CAN GET THEM. AND THE KIDS WHO DONALD PARTS STOCK IN THAT. THEN THE FLIP SIDE TO THIS AND WHERE THE- THE WILL FOR DIRECTORS IN THE- PROBATION SHE'S ARE CORRECT. WE BROUGHT THOSE KIDS BACK AND THEY GOT PLACE. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL DISTANCE STATISTICS THE NUMBER OF KIDS WHO ARE A WALL AT WAR WHO WENT BACK INTO JUVENILE HALL. THAT LEVEL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THOSE KIDS WE BROUGHT BACK. NOT ACCEPTABLE. SO WE HAVE TO AND WHETHER REASONS THAT THAT I'M SUPPORTIVE OF A MORATORIUM. ALTHOUGH I AM SENSITIVE TO MY SPONSORS BELIEVE YOU ME ON THIS. BUT WE HAVE TO LIGHT A FIRE AND WE HAVE TO PUSH HARD TO MAKE SURE WE GET THIS WORK DONE. WE HAVE MONEY NOW IN THE STATE WE HAVE THE MOMENTUM IN SOME IMPETUS. LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND IF ALL WE DO IS KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. AND THEN ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO DO MORE CERTIFICATIONS OF OUT OF STATE FACILITIES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE CONTROL WE DON'T HAVE THE INSIGHT WE DON'T HAVE THE OVERSIGHT. WE'RE GONNA END UP BACK WITH THE SAME SCANDALS SO LET'S TRY THIS A LITTLE BIT HARDER. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE KIDS AND FROM A PEDIATRICIAN STANDPOINT. WHEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF DEVELOPMENT DELAYS AND CHALLENGES FOR KIDS. A LOT OF PHYSICIANS PUSH BACK AND THEIR PUSH BACK IS WE IDENTIFIED I DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO REFER THEM WE DON'T HAVE THE SERVICES. SO IF WE HAVE THE SERVICES IF WE BUILD THIS. IN WE CAN HELP THOSE KIDS. AND WE NO LONGER HAVE TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY SO LET'S JUST DO THAT. I'M WORKING FOR THE WITH THIS POPULATION SPECIFICALLY DEPENDENCY DELINQUENCY KIDS YES. BUT THEY'RE ALSO A LOT OF. DEVELOPMENT DISABLED KIDS AND OTHERS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW REALLY WHERE TO GO THEY GO OUT OF STATE. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE SYSTEM. FOR CALIFORNIA FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. BURKE VERY LARGE STATE I DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY WE SHOULD BE DOING ALL OF THAT HERE AND THIS IS A STEP THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE IN THIS WAY WE NEED TO BE DOING THIS NOW AND WE'RE DOING HERE POLICY. RESIDENT BUDGET. NO THANK THANK YOU AND I ALSO SET ON THE BUDGETS OF THREE- THE ON HEALTH AND EVEN SERVICE SO SOFT TISSUE TO WORK AND- CERTAINLY I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE CAPACITY HERE. WE ARE BIG STATE THERE'S NO REASON WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THAT CAPACITY WE- DOLLAR SIZE BIRD INGENUITY HERE AND ACTUALLY FRANKLY THE LEVEL SERVICES THAT WE- BELIEVE THAT SHOULD BE DELIVERED SO- THANK YOU AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO MOVE TO BUILD APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR PAN US SENATE CONGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM. TO WILL BE SUPPORTING- THIS BILL AND- I AGREE WITH SENATOR PAM YOU KNOW I'D- I ALSO SUPPORT A MORATORIUM I THINK- YOU KNOW WHAT WE LEARNED- ABOUT OUR OUT OF STATE PLACEMENTS. INCREDIBLY EGREGIOUS- AND REALLY SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED AND I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT WE ARE LIABLE FOR THE VIOLATIONS AGAINST THOSE CHILDREN- AND THE DEATH YOU KNOW I. I DON'T KNOW IF I NECESSARILY AGREE THAT THE LEAST AS RESTRICTIVE AS ALWAYS THE BEST I THINK WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO FOCUS ON A SETTINGS AND PLACEMENTS THAT ARE SAFE AND THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF EACH CHILD. I THINK WE'VE SORT OF GOTTEN AWAY FROM FOSTER CARE JUST LIKE WE'VE GOTTEN AWAY FROM OUR HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE WE PUT ALL OF THESE FOLKS IN A BUCKET THINKING THAT- THERE'S A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THE BIGGER THE NUMBER YOU KNOW THE MORE THE MONEY THE MORE THE BADS THE PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED. WITHOUT REALLY RECOGNIZING THAT- EACH PERSON. HAS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. INDIVIDUAL TRIGGERS AND NEEDS AN INDIVIDUALIZED AND CUSTOMIZED RESPONSE THAT IS CONSISTENT- IN ORDER TO HELP THEM THROUGH WHATEVER THE CRISES IT IS THAT THEY HAVE. AND I KNOW AS THE STATE EVEN AS COUNTIES AND CITIES WERE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE SCALABLE WITHOUT NECESSARILY FOCUSING ON WHAT'S GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR THAT PARTICULAR PERSON. I RESPECT THE FACT THAT THERE'S THOUGHTFULNESS TO THIS AND I RESPECT THE FACT FACT THAT. YOU'RE SAYING IT IS COMPLEX THIS IS COMPLICATED AND IT IS COMPLEX. AND TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE PERFECT RIGHT NOW. IF SOMEONE SAID THAT I WOULD LOOK AT THEM AND CROSS MY EYES- WE SHOULD NOT BE THINKING ABOUT DEVELOPING SOMETHING THAT'S PERFECT RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE SO I ACTUALLY SEE THIS AS- PART OF THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO HOW WE RE ENGINEER A SYSTEM. THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WILL BE IN IT RECOGNIZING THAT TAKES TIME RECOGNIZING THERE PROBABLY WILL BE SOME FALSE STARTS BUT THAT IS WHEN YOU KNOW. THAT YOU ARE WORKING TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE GOOD. BECAUSE YOU HAVE KICKED THE TIRES YOU HAVE BROUGHT IN STAKEHOLDERS YOU ARE ADDRESSING THE SLIPS AND THE FAILURES IN THE SETBACKS AND YOU ARE REALLY WORKING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN CREATE A LARGE SYSTEM. THAT SERVES INDIVIDUAL KIDS IN A WAY THAT MEETS THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS SO I SUPPORT THIS AND RECOGNIZE THROUGH YOUR- PRESENTATION. HOW DIFFICULT THIS HAS BEEN AND JUST WANT TO SALUTE YOU FOR IT- AND I TO WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU- SO WHAT DO WE HAVE A MOTION AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TOO MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION AND THIS IS JUST.

ASSEMBLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR AND WE CAN BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST LEAD WITNESS IN AND ACTORS FOR THE PART OF THIS BILL- MUDDY CREWS AND OTHER MIGHTINESS. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS MY NAME IS MERRY CHRISTMAS JOHNNY AND I AM FORMALLY. UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS USE I WAS BORN IN MEXICO AND WAS BROUGHT TO THE UNITED STATES WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD. I ENJOY THE FUNKY CARE WHAT OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN DUE TO CONCERNS OF THE COLLECTOR. I REMEMBER BEFORE I WAS IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM I WANTED TO HAVE A JOB BUT I FOUND OUT I NEEDED A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER TO WORK. AND THAT I DIDN'T CATCH IT WAS ONLY THEN THAT I REALIZED. I WAS VERY. UNDOCUMENTED PERSON A LITTLE AFTER I ENTER FOSTER CARE MY COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER CONNECTED ME WITH SOMEONE WHO HELPED ME OBTAIN A SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE PIZZA AND MY GREEN CARD. I REMEMBER FEELING REALLY HAPPY AND REALLY WHEN I GOT MY GREEN CARD BECAUSE I KNEW HOW MUCH A PERSON WITH NO SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND LOW IMMIGRATION STATUS IN THE COUNTRY STRUGGLES. TO MOVE OVER. THEIR HEAD OR MOVE OUT OF POVERTY. RIGHT NOW MAYBE THE CARD EMIGRATE CARD. I GOT MY FIRST JOB. IN I WILL WHICH COULD MY FOR CAR. I HAD DEAL BETWEEN TO REAP. AND CAN POSSIBILITIES AND SILICON WORKS. AND THEN I BILL I WANTED TO LEAVE A TEAM OF PEOPLE TODAY I EXPLORE DIFFERENT. OF AND OPTION THAT I KNOW WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO. WITHOUT A GREEN CARD INCLUDING MY CURRENT GOAL OF BECOMING A DETECTIVE- NONE OF THESE BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME. TWELVE FOR MAKING pCARD AND THE DOORS OPENED. I AM EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THE CHALLENGING EXPERIENCES OF MY YOU INTO SOMETHING GREAT. MY SUCCESS STORY SHOULD BE ONLY ONE OF MANY. IT IS MY HOPE THAT A DOCUMENT TO YOU IN THE POCKET CARE SYSTEM ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE HELP I RECEIVED. SO THEY TOO CAN OBTAIN IMMIGRATION STATUS THEY QUALIFY FOR. AB EIGHT NINE WOULD HELP ENSURE FALSE YOU ARE LINKED TO THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO OBTAIN IMMIGRATION STATUS AND TRANSITION FOR COSTLY OUT OF POCKET CHRIS THAT THEM. BECAUSE OF THIS I'M HERE BECAUSE WE'RE. GOING TO BILLS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TO. NOW WE ARE MOVING ON LEAD WHAT THE NUMBER TWO AT. A WHITE. MY NAME IS KERRY WHITE AND I'M AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY WITH CHILDREN FOX HUNTER CALIFORNIA. HILTY OF THE NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES AS THE VOICE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND GET. OUR TRAINS AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL STAFF REPRESENT OVER THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND ABUSED AND NEGLECTED CILDREN IN THE LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER COUNTY FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO APPEARING ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS AND DATED A DEPENDENCY PROCEEDINGS. GLC PROVIDES REPRESENTATION AND A HOST OF RELATED HEARING THE CHECK TO ENSURE THE WELL BEING AND FUTURE SUCCESS OF EACH CHILD. WE THINK IT'S SIMPLY MEMBER LEVINE FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION WHICH WILL ENSURE THERE ARE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO PROTECT UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO ENTER THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FORMS OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF. THAT WOULD PUT THEM ON A PATH TOWARDS OBTAINING LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS ALSO KNOWN AS THE GREEN CARD. CONGRESS RECOGNIZED THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AND VULNERABILITIES OF UNDOCUMENTED AUSTRIA. AND IN RESPONSE CREATED A SPECIFIC FORM OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF FOR THE FEW. WHO ARE UNABLE TO REUNIFY WITH THE PARENT CALLED SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS. WHICH IS ITSELF A PATH TOWARDS BAKUL PERMANENT RESIDENCY. AND DOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO LEAVE THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM WITHOUT OBTAINING SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS OR SOME OTHER FOR IMMIGRATION RELIEF WILL BE UNABLE TO LAWFULLY WORK OR TRANSITION. SUCCESSFULLY TO ADULTHOOD. HOWEVER THERE ARE NO REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THE ISSUES ARE IDENTIFIED AND LINKED WITH IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ASSIST THEM IN OBTAINING THAT IMMIGRATION REALLY. AS A RESULT THE LEVEL OF THE SYSTEM FOR YOU TO RECEIVE ON THEIR IMMIGRATION MATTER VERY FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. EMBOLDEN COUNTY SUCH AS SACRAMENTO OUR LAWYERS ARE TYPICALLY THE ONES SEARCHING FOR IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY OR NONPROFIT TO REPRESENT OUR CLIENTS. COMPARISON AND LOS ANGELES THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY CLOSELY WORKS THAT ARE TRAINED TO IDENTIFY LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND PRO BONO ATTORNEYS WILL PROVIDE IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES FOR OUR CLIENTS. WE HAVE ALSO HEARD ACCOUNTS OF OTHER COUNTIES WHERE NO IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES OR IN. ON OTHER RESULTS YOU DO NOT RECEIVE THE IMMIGRATION RELIEF TO WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED AND EVENTUALLY LEAVE THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WITHOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS. UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN THE PENALTY SYSTEM ALREADY FACE A NUMBER OF HURDLES AT THE WITH LITTLE TO NO INFORMATION OR DOCUMENTATION ABOUT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. EVEN WHEN THEY MAY BE AND REMOVAL OR DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS. EIGHTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE WILL REQUIRE THAT COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE TO IDENTIFY AND TRACK UNDOCUMENTED COST YOU THEIR COUNTY. IT WILL REQUIRE THAT THE AGENCIES MAKE BEST EFFORTS TO LINK THE CHILDREN IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND IF NECESSARY IDENTIFY ANY GAPS IN SERVICES AND SUPPORT. ALL OF THESE MEASURES ARE AIMED AT ENSURING THAT UNDOCUMENTED AUSTRIAN YOU NOT FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE IMMIGRATION RELIEF FOR WHICH THEY ARE SO FREQUENTLY ELIGIBLE WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION.

AND IN LANGUAGE SUCH AS THAT- REALLY MAKING IT- SORT OF THE HELLO IS A PERMISSIVE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE INITIALLY WHEN I READ THE SAID THE BILL WAS ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO SAY- WHEN THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE AND I'M SPEAKING TO THE COUNTY PARTICULARLY AS OPPOSED TO COMMITTEE BASE AGENCIES- WHEN THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE- THAT- THE COUNTY WOULD DO THE REFERRAL MAKE SURE TO DO THE REFERRAL THE IMMIGRANT SERVICES. SOME LITTLE CONCERN I KNOW IN IN MY HOME COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY- A KEEPING REGISTRIES ON STATUS- RACE- CREED BORGEN BAND- IN I JUST WONDER WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO IN TERMS OF SUPERSEDING ARE TEMPTING HIM MANDATE THAT YOU TO REGISTRIES OF AGAIN COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC RECORDS ISSUES- IN IN A COUNTY THAT IF THE LITERALLY. IDENTIFIED AND TRACKED IT WOULD IT WOULD SEEM TO MEAN THAT THE INQUIRE AS TO STATUS AND THEN KEEP A REGISTRY AVAILABLE OR SOME KIND OF TRACKING DEVICE WHICH WOULD BE ORDINARILY A PUBLIC RECORD- IN THE COURSE. IN MY COUNTY- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONFLICT WITH WITH ICE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES IN TERMS OF KEEPING THAT CAN INFORMATION- YOU KNOW OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE SAID- INTERESTED IN IN DETAINEES- IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ADDRESS OUR COMMITTED SO THAT'S A LONG QUESTION I'M JUST REALLY INTERESTED IN. WHERE THE BILL'S GOING IN TERMS OF MANDATING THAT IDENTIFICATION VERSUS. A NON MANDATED OR IDENTIFYING VERSES I THINK THE LANGUAGE- IN MY PACKET HERE SAYS THE ITEM YEAH THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR AND THIS IS BEEN. EVER SINCE I AUTHORED AB NINE HUNDRED SOMETHING THAT I STRUGGLED WITH BECAUSE I RECALL. LEARNING FROM ONE OF THE LEGAL AID CENTERS THAT THE VERY FIRST ASSIDUOUS YOUTH WAS PROTECTED UNDER AB NINE HUNDRED AND TODD I WAS GOING TO BE IN LOS ANGELES AND I MADE A POINT TO GO AND VISIT NO E. THE YOUNG MAN- BECAUSE I WANTED TO MEET SOMEONEWHO IS IMPACTED BY THIS BILL AND GET TO KNOW HIM IN AND LEARN HIS STORY AND- I FELT LIKE I GAINED SO MUCH PERSPECTIVE. ABOUT WHY HE CAME TO CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WHAT HE WAS RUNNING FROM AND- HOW YOU KNOW HOW HIS FAMILY HAD TREATED HIM BEFORE HE HE MADE THAT JOURNEY. AND- AND WE YOU KNOW AT. I WOULD GO INTO A HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HELPED BY THIS BILL AND- AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD NO IDEA WE DIDN'T TRACK IT THOSE WHO GO AND APPLY FOR SUGGESTS THERE IS NO WAY TO COLLECT THAT DATA I'M EVEN THIS BILL DOESN'T REALLY DO THAT. BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IF I COUNTY KNOWS- AND LEARNS THAT SOMEONE IS- UNDOCUMENTED THAT DATE AND MAKE THE CONNECTION TO LEGAL REPRESENTATION- THE TRACKING IS FOR. WHAT I HOPE IS GOING TO BUDGETARY PURPOSES IN THE FUTURE SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE NEED THE SUPPORT- AND WE CAN'T BUDGET FOR IT AFFECTIVELY AND SO THE WAY THAT WE'VE AND THIS BILL REALLY STARTED OUT AS A FUNDING MECHANISM BILL AND IT CAME CAME DOWN TO A DATA BILL SO WHILE THE COUNTIES MAKERS PERSONAL CONNECTIONS FOR LEGAL SERVICES FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH. THE DATA THAT IS COLLECTED AND IS DE IDENTIFIED IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW MANY YOUTH- MAY NEED TO BE THAT MAY NEED TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE SERVICES- AND HOW MANY OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY GETTING THE SERVICES SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND COSTS AND PERHAPS FUTURE- LEGAL- BUDGETARY MEASURES. THE APPRECIATE THAT I'M- I AM- BECAUSE SOME WORRIED AND I'M NOT TRYING THIS PUT HAIRS HERE BUT IT IS IMPORTANT- WHEN IT COMES TO THE DAY TO DAY. REDUCTION OF THE DATA THAT TO DE IDENTIFY. ALMOST IMPLIES THAT YOU INITIALLY IDENTIFIED RIGHT AND- IT IS VERY HARD TO UNRING THAT BELL AS YOU AS WE ALL KNOW HERE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT OF WOOD COUNTY ASSEMBLES A LIST. AND THEN FORWARD IT TO THE STATE WITHOUT NAMES AND- IDENTIFYING INFORMATION THE ORIGINAL IDENTIFICATION IS STILL THERE SOMEWHERE IS SUBJECT TO- YOU KNOW A RECORDS REQUEST WHICH- AGAIN HAS BEEN. RELEASED I CAN ONLY SPEAK. TO MY HOME COUNTY HAS BEEN EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF- PROTECTING THOSE INDIVIDUALS FROM. ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SO- I APPRECIATE THE WITH THE RESPONSE FROM ALL. THE SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND KEEP. A STUDYING HERE TO SEE IF- I'M SATISFIED YOU KNOW FURTHER AS IT AS IT MOVES ALONG- BUT IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE THE BILL WOULD NEED TO. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WOULD NEED TO- EXEMPT THE DATA THAT'S BEING GATHERED FROM THE C. P. R. A. YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT- CARRIES DID NOT HAVE TO GIVE THAT INFORMATION UP- YOU KNOW TO THOSE WHO WERE OR TRYING FOR OTHER PURPOSES TO. TO TRACK. IDENTIFY IN SOME CASES PURSUE YOU KNOW THE UNDOCUMENTED SO THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I WILL I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AS FAR AS YOUR MINOR NINE AGAIN- I WANT TO REITERATE HER SUPPORT OF. THE WORK IN THE ATTACK BUT I'M SENSITIVE TO IT THAT THE OTHER BILL I HAVE UP RIGHT NOW IS A DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION LEGISLATION INTRODUCED SO I'M VERY SENSE OF THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT AS FAR AS KEEPING INFORMATION. IN YEAH MY VOTE TODAY BECAUSE I. KNOW THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE WORKING. ON UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SAN CRITTERS THE ANSWER PAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU CENTER LIVING FOR BRING THIS BILL FORD- CERTAINLY WE WANT ARE UNDOCUMENTED- FIRST USED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THEY NEED- THAT MIGHT ALLOW THEM TO ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO BE AN- STANDS COUNTRY- IT'S APPROPRIATE SO I GUESS THAT COUPLE QUESTIONS WELL THE SORT TOGETHER SO IT SAYS BEST EFFORTS SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHAT DEFINES BEST EFFORT. AND THEN SECONDARILY RELATED TO THAT IS YOU KNOW WE FUNDED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY THROUGH THE FARM SOCIAL SERVICES A PROGRAM ON CALIFORNIA PROVIDE ACTUALLY STATE FUNDED IMMIGRATION- ADVISER OR LEGAL COUNSEL SO- IS THE ERROR I THOUGHT ABOUT- INSTRUCTING ACTUALLY AGAIN THESE FOSTER USER EASY TO AND COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS RIGHT- THAT- THAT THAT THAT MINIMUM- IF THERE ISN'T A LOCAL IMMIGRATION SERVICE THEY CAN MAKE A FOR ALL TO THAT THERE'S OF THESE REFERRAL PERHAPS OF THE STATE ONE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM- SO AS FAR THEIR BEST EFFORTS SO I GUESS- THAT THAT'S MY QUESTION WHAT'S BEST EFFORT AND- IS THIS PERHAPS. MAYBE ARTICULATING DATA WHETHER THE LEGISLATION SOME DIRECTION SO THAT SO THAT SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE SURE TO THAT- FOSTER YOU STUDIES ON SECOND THOUGHT SHE'D ACTUALLY GET ACCESS TO. IMMIGRATION COUNSEL YEAH I MEAN THIS IS FAR FROM A MANDATE THAT THEY HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BUT I THINK THAT THE BEST EFFORTS IS REFLECTIVE OF ONE THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW THE STATUS AND THEN TO OF COURSE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A LEGAL AID- ORGANIZATION OR FUNDING AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND THE POINT TO THE BILL IS LET'S UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS POPULATION IS LIKE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE IT POSSIBLE- FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING ABUSE ABANDONMENT NEGLECT. TO BE SAFE SEEK ASYLUM IN CALIFORNIA AS SO MANY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO- WHEN THOSE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN THERE AND WHEN THEY'VE BEEN ABLE. TO IDENTIFY- THE STATUS- THANK YOU I CERTAINLY. THE THIS FIRST OF ALL. THE FOURTEENTH MAY THE NECESSARY TO REVEAL SO THAT THAT'S- BUT ALSO I THINK ON THE SOCIAL SERVICE SIDE- THAT ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE ALSO FUNDING. NOT TO SAY THAT WE CAN PERHAPS GIVE MORE MONEY BUT- IMMIGRATION COUNSEL. EVEN IF THERE WASN'T LOCAL AVAILABLE ABILITY TO- AT LEAST THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER CHANNEL THAT THEY COULD. DIE ACCESS- THROUGH BEST EFFORTS. I ALSO JUST STEP BEFORE I CONCLUDE IS- I DID MAKE NOTE THAT THE WITNESS WHO TESTIFIED MENTION MY COUNTY SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS NOT BE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL SO I LOOK FOR THE FOLLOWING UP. WITH THAT WITNESS ON THAT WE SHOULD DO BETTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. AND WITH THAT- I CERTAINLY I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE YOUR BILL. TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU A SENATOR PAN AND AT THIS MOMENT A WITH THE MOTION I'LL- HOW CAN AFFECT YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE FOR. A CLOSING STATEMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SURE THANK YOU FOR THE DELIBERATION AGAIN ON THIS IMPORTANT AND COMPLEX ISSUE AFFECTING MANY- HOPEFUL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU ARE SO FAST FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU ALSO HAVE A MOTION MADE BY A SENATOR PAN ON- CONSULTING Q. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON THIS MEASURE. AB EIGHT TO NINE BY LEVINE THE MOTION IS DO YOU PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY HER TADO I FURTADO I'D JONES. CORTESE HI COURTESY I COM LONGER HI CONLOGUE ARE AYE PAN HI AND I. THANK YOU OFFICES BELONG CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND ATTACKS OF AGENDA ITEM FOURTEEN. AB ONE TWO TWO ZERO BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS THREE OF US. AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS I AM PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWELVE TWENTY AM I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SUMMARIZED ON PAGE NINE OF THE ANALYSIS. LAST SESSION I AUTHORED AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE WHICH WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY SOLUTION FOR THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. AB TWELVE TWENTY IN THE FORM BEFORE YOU TODAY IS THE RESULT OF ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT RESTRUCTURING CHANGES. SO WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT TO HOW THE STATE IS COMBATING HOMELESSNESS. AB TWELVE TWENTY MAKES A NUMBER OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE CURRENT HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. THIS MEASURE RENAME RENAMES THE HOMELESS COUNCIL TO THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS. THIS NAME CHANGE MORE ACCURATELY REPRESENTS THE PURPOSE OF THE COUNCIL I WILL SET THE STAGE FOR THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP IN COMMITTEES. MEMBERSHIP WILL CONSIST OF DIRECTORS AND SECRETARIES OF THE STATE INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO HAVE LIVED OF EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH UNDER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE. IN MARCH THE HOMELESS COUNCIL ADOPTED ITS FIRST EVER ACTION PLAN FOR PREVENTING AND ENDING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA THE ACTION PLAN PROVIDES THE DETAILS ON HOW THE HOMELESS COUNCIL WILL ACHIEVE ITS GOALS. THIS PLAN COMES AT A CRITICAL TIME AS THE BIDEN HARRIS ADMINISTRATION IS BEGINNING TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS AS SUCH THE STATE MUST ENSURE PROPER AND EFFICIENT COORDINATION AMONG STATE AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS. OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY HAVE SIMILAR COUNCIL STRUCTURES SO THIS IS A STANDARD MODEL. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DEDICATED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS WHILE STATE FUNDING PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HOMELESSNESS FUNDING ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE SYSTEMIC ISSUES. WE MUST ENSURE THAT THE COUNCIL IS COMPROMISE OF STATE LEADERS AND DEPARTMENT HEADS WHO ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO EFFECTIVELY COORDINATE AND RESPOND TO HOMELESSNESS. TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I HAVE SHARON REPORT DIRECTOR OF THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF CENTER RIVAS A LOTTERY PLEASE BRING ON TO THE LINER- THE MAIN WITNESS- SHARON REPORT TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE TWENTY I BELIEVE YOU THREE MINUTES MAXIMUM. THANK YOU SHARON MEMBERS I'M SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING A SUPPORTER OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEFENSE AT TWELVE TWENTY. BATES THROUGHOUT THE NATION HAVE CREATED INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS TO COORDINATE THE ACTIVITIES OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES IMPACTING ON MARTHA. IN FEBRUARY OUR STATE AUDITOR STATED AT LEAST NINE STATE AGENCIES ADMINISTER AND OVERSEE FORTY ONE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE FUNDING FOR PURPOSES RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS. IT DRASTIC DISJOINTED FRAGMENTED NATURE OF THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AND GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY TO CREATE THE HOMER COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS SAID THE COORDINATING COUNCIL RECENTLY ADOPTED AN ACTION PLAN TO FOSTER STRONGER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. AB TWELVE TWENTY WOULD STRENGTHEN THE COUNCIL'S MECCA IT REFORM THE COUNCIL TO FOLLOW THE MODELS AT THE U. S. INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER MODEL STATE HEAD OF- OPERATED ACTIVE H. INTERAGENCY COUNCIL. THE FIRM MUNGER CHANGES WOULD BE TO ENSURE REPRESENTATIVES OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES WERE PROFICIENT MAKING AUTHORITY ARE SITTING ON THE COUNCIL NOT JUST TO UPDATE COUNCIL MEMBER AGENCIES ON STATE WORK BETTER HOLD HONEST CONVERSATIONS ON PATHWAYS THE SOLUTION. WE ARE HOPEFUL THESE CHANGES COULD LEAD TO COLLABORATION THAT WILL REDUCE DISCHARGES FROM STATE FUNDED INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS AND THE HOMEOWNER. AND STRONG RECORDED COORDINATION OF STATE RESOURCES. I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BECAUSE DEDICATION TO SOLVING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA AND I ASK FOR YOUR EYES. THANK YOU. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH- THEY'LL MOVE ONTO DIGITAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND JUST TO CLARIFY SORRY MIGHT MISS THIS PART WITH THEIR AMENDMENTS- THAT TO BE TAKEN HERE AND YOU SAID THAT THIS MEANT I ACCEPTED OKAY.

A FEW YEARS AGO MY OFFICE HELP THE SURVIVOR OF ABUSE WHO WAS UNDOCUMENTED AND LIKE MANY SURVIVORS SHE NEEDED CAL WORKS BUT WITH ELIGIBLE ONLY FOR HER STUDENTS AND CHILDREN ONCE WE FILED FOR YOU BEING THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HELP HER GET STATE FUNDED CAL WORKS FOR HERSELF ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AND WHEN SHE THANKED US SHE EXPLAINED SHE WAS SO GRATEFUL BECAUSE SHE'D BEEN ABOUT TO DROP A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HER ABUSER BECAUSE HE HAD PROMISED AN EXTRA HUNDRED DOLLARS IN CHILD SUPPORT EACH MONTH AND SHE DESPERATELY NEEDED THAT MONEY TO MAKE ENDS MEET. WITH THAT LITTLE EXTRA BIT OF TOWERS SHE COULD AFFORD TO KEEP THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IN PLACE. I THOUGHT OF THE THREE. WHEN THEY LEGAL WORK WITH ANOTHER UNDOCUMENTED SURVIVORS IS ELIGIBLE FOR A DIFFERENT IMMIGRATION PATHWAY UNDER THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. AND ONCE SHE FILED HER VOLATILE PETITION IT WOULD BE ABOUT FOUR MONTHS UNTIL SHE WAS ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERALLY FUNDED BENEFIT. PERFORMANCE MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE TAT LONG THE PROSPECT OF FOR MONTHS WITH NO INCOME OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT WHAT'S WEBER WAS SO TERRIFYING. THAT THE CLIENT ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO STAY WITH HER ABUSER. AB FORTY SIXTY ONE WOULD OFFER ACCESS TO STATE PUBLIC BENEFITS ON EQUAL FOOTING FOR IMMIGRANT SURVIVORS FOLLOWING DIFFERENT SURVIVOR BASED PASSED A LAWFUL STATUS. IT WOULD COVER INDIVIDUALS WHO APPLIED FOR RELIEF UNDER OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH APPLIED FOR SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS. IN PERSON TO PROPERLY FILED AN APPLICATION FOR ASYLUM.
