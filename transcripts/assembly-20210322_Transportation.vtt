CONGESTION AND THAT'S

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:07.579
UNACCEPTABLE. THIS HAS BEEN THE

00:29:07.645 --> 00:29:11.649
GREATEST A SINGLE YEAR INCREASE

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:12.917

00:29:39.677 --> 00:29:41.212
APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.180
STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:43.915
EMISSIONS WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:04.802
IN MASS TRANSIT. THAT IS

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:08.606
CONVENIENT AND SAFE. AND FAST

00:30:08.673 --> 00:30:09.374
AND MORE DESIRABLE FOR OUR

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.276
RESIDENTS NOT JUST FOR PUBLIC

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:30.762
NOW HERE'S SOMETHING A LITTLE

00:30:30.828 --> 00:30:33.298

HIGHWAYS AND STRUCTURES HAVE

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:38.970
BEEN NAMED HOWEVER. VERY FEW OF

00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:41.639
THOSE NAMES ARE THOSE OF WOMEN.

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:43.308
IN FACT MY STUFF WENT THROUGH

00:30:43.374 --> 00:30:44.809
THE NAMES AND FOUND THAT LESS

00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:46.844

00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:48.379
LESS THAN FIFTY OF THEM ARE

HEAR FROM THE TESTIMONY THE

00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:21.598
FACT THAT THE EXHIBITION OF

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:25.302
FROM A SPEED CONTEST- THEY

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:26.170

FOR THE COURT. TO HAVE THE

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:31.809
EXACT SAME- PUNISHMENTS AND-

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:33.877
AND PENALTIES AS A SPEECH

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:37.014
CONTEST AND THAT'S AND SO

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.215
STRICTLY ASPEN HIGH ABOVE.

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:38.816

I HAD HEARD YOU WERE GOING TO

00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:50.794
WORK WITH THEM TO GET THEM OFF

00:43:50.861 --> 00:43:52.396
OPPOSITION IS THAT CORRECT. YES

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:53.964
IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:55.299
THE ACLU AND THE OPPOSITION TO

00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:57.267

00:43:57.334 --> 00:43:58.769
WE CERTAINLY ARE OPEN TO

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:00.004
EXEMPTIONS I THINK THAT OUR

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.772
BILL HAS AN EXEMPTION TO ALLOW

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.707
AN INDIVIDUAL TO. HAVE THEIR

00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:05.909
LICENSE TO OUGHT TO GO TO WORK-

THOSE MOMENTS YOU'LL GET THEM

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.855

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:19.990
AS HAS MENTIONED- BY THE ACLU

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:21.158
THAT IS OUR CONCERN THAT IT'S

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:22.760
TOO RESTRICTIVE AND SO WE WOULD

00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:24.461
BE WE WOULD HOPEFULLY BE OPEN

00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:25.262

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:36.774
TO SEE IF THEY WOULD REMOVE THE

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.975

PLAY OFF OPPOSITION IF YOU TO

00:44:44.214 --> 00:44:48.852
TAKE MOMENTS- SO. IT'S A LITTLE

00:44:48.919 --> 00:44:50.120
HARD TO SAY IN PORTLAND

00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:52.356
WITHOUT- IN LANGUAGE I THINK

00:44:52.423 --> 00:44:53.090
WHAT WOULD BRING UP A

00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:56.160
COMPETITION. IS TO EXTEND THE

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:58.529

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:16.370
COLLECTOR CARS ALREADY HAVE A

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:18.506
PATH FOR SMOG CHECK EXEMPTION

01:31:18.573 --> 01:31:20.208
IF THEY MEET CRITERIA OF BEING

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:23.811
COLLECTOR CARS- SO I KNOW THAT

01:31:23.878 --> 01:31:26.714
pLIKE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:28.249
ACHIEVE THAT STATUS WHICH WE

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:30.151
ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK ON

01:31:30.218 --> 01:31:31.352
BUT THE BILL THAT'S IN FRONT OF

01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:32.486
US TODAY IS A BILL WHICH

01:31:32.553 --> 01:31:35.323
EXEMPTS ALL CARS. BEFORE NINETY

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:36.424
THREE FROM SMOG CHECK NOT JUST

01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:37.992
COLLECTOR CARS THESE WOULD BE

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:38.793
CARDS THAT PEOPLE DO USE AS

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.494
THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF

01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:41.662
TRANSPORTATION YOU KNOW THESE

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:44.565
ARE EXACTLY THE CARS THAT WERE

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:45.166
TRYING TO GET OFF THE ROAD AS

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:47.602

THE COLLECTOR CAR. CONCERN BUT

01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:55.009
THIS BILL- I CAN'T SUPPORT

01:31:55.076 --> 01:31:56.944
BECAUSE IT GOES FAR BEYOND THAT

01:31:57.011 --> 01:32:00.314
IS THAT YOUR QUESTION. IT IS I

01:32:00.381 --> 01:32:03.517
I'M JUST THE DISCREPANCY IS I'M

01:32:03.584 --> 01:32:04.986
I'M- TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:07.321
THANK. I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:08.623

MY CONVERSATIONS WTH HIM ALSO

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:12.827
I'VE LEARNED THAT THIS IS THIS

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:15.263
APPLIES ONLY TO. COLLECTOR

01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:17.198
VEHICLES SON TRYING TO

01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:18.065
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE

01:32:18.132 --> 01:32:19.800
DISCREPANCY IS I WOULD LIKE TO

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:21.736
ACTUALLY ASK- MY COMMITTEE

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:23.471
STAFFER TO SPEAK TO WHETHER

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:24.872
THERE WERE ABOUT THE AMENDMENT

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:27.975
PROCESS- MAYBE SHE CAN GIVE US

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:29.377
SOME CLARITY ON THAT. AND SORT

01:32:29.443 --> 01:32:30.678
OF WHERE THE DISCREPANCY LAWS

01:32:30.745 --> 01:32:32.446
HERE YEAH MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:33.714
THAT IS BROADER THAN JUST

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:35.116
ADDRESSING THE COLLECTOR CAR

01:32:35.182 --> 01:32:37.551
ISSUE. AND SO WE WOULD LIKE WE

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:38.719
BE OPEN TO LOOKING AT

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:40.254
AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD NARROW IT

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:41.455
TO JUST FOCUS ON THE COLLECTOR

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:44.492
CAR ISSUE SO THERE ISN'T A

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:50.631
BROADER SMOG EXEMPTION. DOES

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:53.968
THAT ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION- IT

01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:55.736
TO SOME EXTENT AND YES AND NO

01:32:55.803 --> 01:32:57.571
BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO THE

01:32:57.638 --> 01:32:59.540
QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENS TODAY

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:01.542
BECAUSE I'M I'M JUST WONDERING

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:03.110
IF THE AUTHOR IS WILLING

01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:04.712
COMMITTEE STAFF MANNER AT THIS

01:33:04.779 --> 01:33:07.848
POINT TO ALSO MAKE AMENDMENTS

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:09.984
THAT HE CAN COMMIT TO THE CHAIR.

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:11.252
MAY I MAKE A SUGGESTION IF THE

01:33:11.319 --> 01:33:13.220
AUTHOR IS WILLING TO WORK WITH

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:14.789
US TO NARROW THIS BILL AND TO

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:15.856
ADDRESS THE COLLECTOR CAR

01:33:15.923 --> 01:33:17.825
CONCERNS. MY RECOMMENDATION IS

01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:19.026
THAT WE NOT VOTE ON THIS BILL

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:20.461
TODAY AND SAID WE CAN WORK WITH

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:21.595
HIM ON THE BILL ON AMENDMENTS

01:33:21.662 --> 01:33:22.897
THAT HE WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:24.865
WOULD THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE

01:33:24.932 --> 01:33:25.700
TO THE COLLECTOR CAR COMMUNITY

01:33:25.766 --> 01:33:27.001
AND HELPFUL TO THEM. WE COULD

01:33:27.068 --> 01:33:29.470
TRY TO COME TO SOME AGREEMENT

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:30.104
WITH THAT AND BRING IT BACK IN

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:31.706
A FURTHER HEARING. SO THAT WE

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:32.773
CAN ALL GET ON THE SAME PAGE

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.275
AND NONE OF US HERE I DON'T

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:35.476
THINK LISA FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:37.178
I. IF THE COLLECTOR CAR

01:33:37.244 --> 01:33:38.913
COMMUNITY IS HAVING. AN ISSUE

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:41.082
OR CONCERN. I WOULD LOVE TO

01:33:41.148 --> 01:33:41.983
LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT AND SEE

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:43.317
HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THAT WITH

01:33:43.384 --> 01:33:44.285
THE BILL THAT'S IN FRONT OF US

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:45.987
TODAY GOES FAR BEYOND THAT AND

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:47.188
I CAN NOT SUPPORT THAT BILL SO

01:33:47.254 --> 01:33:48.889

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:50.658
