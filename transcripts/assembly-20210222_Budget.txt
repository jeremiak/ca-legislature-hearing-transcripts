THE SECOND PART OF OUR AGENDA WILL BE CONSIDERATION OF OUR SCHOOL RE OPENING BILL S. B. EIGHTY SIX. I HAVE TO SAY THAT THERE'S BEEN A HUGE AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION AROUND THIS PARTICULAR BILL I HAVE TO SAY THAT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THE LATE LATE NIGHT LETTER THAT I RECEIVED FROM. MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS SUPERINTENDENT OR SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION THE AGAIN ASKED US TO QUOTE UNQUOTE DO NO HARM.

TO FOR THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE TO DO IN PERSON LEARNING. WHEN HE WAS HELLO. UNFORTUNATE DISTRICTS TO THE FALL BILLION. IN ONLY USED 11% OF THE MONEY FOR IN PERSON LEARNING. THEN AGAIN THEY WANT US TO DO THE SAME THING THEY WANT US TO GIVE THE MONEY WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY NO GUARANTEES OF IN PERSON LEARNING THIS YEAR- I AM NORMALLY A HUGE PROPONENT OF LOCAL CONTROL BUT THIS YEAR. LOCAL CONTROL HAS BEEN A COMPLETE FAILURE. WE HAVE SEEN THE WHOLE TRUST US MODEL FROM THE DISTRICTS FELL. FIELD OUR STUDENTS FILTER FAMILIES ITS FILTER TEACHERS IT'S FILLED OUR STAFF. WE ARE AT A STANDSTILL WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE HAS STEPPED IN. TO WORK ON A SOLUTION TO RE OPEN OUR SCHOOLS. WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT HARM DONE BECAUSE UNLIKE THE LETTER THAT WAS SENT AND WE SEE SIGNIFICANT HARM DONE TO OUR STUDENTS. WE'VE HAD A YEAR OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE HAD TO STAY AT HOME INCLUDING MY TWO DAUGHTERS. HAVE HAD TO STAY HOME DO ALL THEIR LEARNING ONLINE TO OLDER LEARNING BY THEMSELVES. REALLY IN SOCIAL ISOLATION WITHOUT THEIR FRIENDS WITHOUT THEIR TEACHERS THERE'S LEARNING LOSS. BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN MENTAL HEALTH COSTS. WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE AS A LEGISLATURE AS A STATE GOVERNMENT TO GET OUR SCHOOLS. ARE BACK OPEN. AND YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT THERE WILL BE NO PROGRAM THAT HAS PASSED WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTABILITY.

WALK THE MEMBERS THROUGH SB EIGHTY SIX WHICH IS THE- SCHOOL REOPENING SAFE IN SCHOOL OPEN SCHOOLS PLAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GABLE CONSULTANT FOR THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE. AS THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC BEGAN SPREADING ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS BEGAN VOLUNTARILY CLOSING IN ORDER TO PREVENT FURTHER COMMUNITY SPREAD. OVER THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY SCHOOLS REMAINED CLOSED FOR THE PATCHWORK APPROACH TO ONLINE OR DISTANCE LEARNING AND STUDENT ENGAGEMENT. AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT CALIFORNIA ADOPTED MINIMUM STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS FOR DISTANCE LEARNING. BUT EMPHASIZE THE SCHOOLS WERE TO PROVIDE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC EALTH PROVIDED THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF GUIDANCE SPECIFICALLY FOR SCHOOLS TO GUIDE THEIR OPENING AND CLOSING TO DECISIONS AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY FACTORS WHEN OPEN. WHAT IS BEEN THE CLEAR CONTACTS BETWEEN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY AND NOW IS THE PUBLIC EDUCATORS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ASSUME THE ROLE OF PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. IN ORDER TO SAFELY NAVIGATE WHEN AND HOW TO OPEN SCHOOL CAMPUSES. CLEAR STATE LEVEL PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTISE AND STANDARDS ARE NECESSARY TO RELIEVE PUBLIC EDUCATION EXPERTS OF THIS TOOL BURDEN. THE STATE HAS ALREADY MOVED FORWARD WITH SOME KEY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH SB EIGHTY SIX BUT NOT LOCATED IN THE BILL. CDPH HAS ISSUED FIRM PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE SPECIFIC TO SCHOOLS IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS REFERENCED IN THE BILL. THE STATE IS ALSO PROCURE TWO MONTHS OF PP AND SAFETY SUPPLIES TO EVERY SCHOOL IN THE STATE. THE STATE HAS TILTED UP TESTING CAPACITY TO SUPPORT SCHOOL COVERED NINETEEN TESTING DIRECTLY. AS OF THIS WEEK OVER ONE THOUSAND SCHOOLS IN FORTY ONE COUNTIES ARE NOW IMPLEMENTING SCHOOL CENTERED COVERT NINETEEN TESTING. VIA THE STATE'S VALENCIA BRANCH LABORATORY. THE STATE HAS NOW LAUNCHED THE SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL HUB TO PROVIDE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY AROUND SCHOOL TRANSMISSION AND OPENING STATUS DATA. AND A COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATION EXCELLENCE AND CDPH CREATE A ROBUST PEDIATRIC HEALTH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CAPACITY AND PROVIDING TA DIRECTLY TO SCHOOLS SPECIFIC TO THEIR RE OPENING AND SAFETY NEEDS. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS ANNOUNCED HIS GOAL TO HAVE ALL SCHOOLS SAFELY RE OPEN IN HIS FIRST ONE HUNDRED DAYS IN OFFICE AND IS GREATLY INCREASED CALIFORNIA'S PLANNED VACCINE SUPPLY. AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION HAS THAT THEY SHARE THE GOAL OF ACCELERATING SAFE SCHOOL RE OPENING. AND SB EIGHTY SIX IS THE LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE INTENDED TO FACILITATE SAFE SCHOOL RE OPENING IN EVERY COMMUNITY THIS SCHOOL YEAR. THE INTENDED SB EIGHTY SIX IS TO HAVE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTISE AND CLEARER ENFORCED COMMON STANDARDS LEAD RE OPENING DECISIONS IN EVERY SCHOOL ACROSS THE STATE. THIS BILL ENCOMPASSES THE THREE DISTINCT COMPONENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE SAFE AND OPEN SCHOOLS PLAN INTENDED TO FACILITATE A SAFE AND PHASED APPROACH TO RE OPENING ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. T. K. THROUGH SIXTH GRADE FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN THE SCHOOL YEAR. FIRST PUBLIC HEALTH AND SCHOOL STATUS DATA AND VACCINES. TO SCHOOL RE OPENING INCENTIVE GRANTS. AND THREE STUDENT LEARNING RECOVERY GRANTS. THE BILL APPROPRIATES A TOTAL OF SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUNDS FOR THESE PURPOSES. THE BILL ALSO MAKES PANDEMIC RELATED FLEXIBILITIES FOR THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS EXPENDITURE DEADLINE CHANGES FOR THE SCHOOL CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUNDS THEY HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED. IN CONTRAST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO INCLUDES TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR COMPETITIVE RE OPENING GRANTS AND FOUR POINT SIX BILLION FOR LEARNING RECOVERY GRANT. THE STATE HAS ALSO RECEIVED OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SAY FREE OPENING MEASURING AND ADDRESSING LEARNING LOSS AND OTHER ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF COVERT NINETEEN ON OUR STUDENTS. SPECIFICALLY THE PROVISIONS OF SENATE BILL EIGHTY SIX. ON COULD NINETEEN VACCINES. SB EIGHTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO MAKE VACCINES AVAILABLE TO ALL SCHOOL STAFF TO PROVIDE PEOPLE INSTRUCTION OR SERVICES IN PERSON. A FIRM STEP BEYOND THE STATE'S ONE B. ALLOWANCES. ON COULD NINETEEN REPORTING AND PUBLIC HEALTH REQUIREMENTS SB EIGHTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS TO REPORT EMPLOYEE AND STUDENT CODE NINETEEN POSITIVE CASES AND SCHOOL OPENING STATUS. CHOIRS LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS TO TAKE NECESSARY STEPS TO RESPOND TO THE POSSIBLE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN CASES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. REQUIRES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS TO POST A COMPLETED CODE NINETEEN SCHOOL SAFETY PLAN ON THEIR INTERNET WEBSITE NO LATER THAN APRIL FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND IT REQUIRES CITY PH TO POST THIS DATA ON A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE WEBSITE. ON LEARNING STUDENT LEARNING RECOVERY GRANTS. SB EIGHTY SIX WOULD PROVIDE FOUR POINT FIVE SIX BILLION AND ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS FOR STUDENT LEARNING RECOVERY GRANTS TO EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOL TO FACILITATE THE LAUNCH OF A MULTI YEAR LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION THE FRONT. IT PROVIDES A STUDENT LEARNING RECOVERY GRANTS BASED OFF OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WITH A BASELINE FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS. REQUIRES ELEAZAR TO PROVIDE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE FUNDS. IT DIRECTS FUNDS FOR INSTRUCTIONAL AND STUDENT SUPPORTS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SUMMER SCHOOL EXTENDED YEAR EXTENDING INSTRUCTIONAL DATE TIME AND OTHER WILL IN PERSON SERVICES SUCH AS ONE ON ONE TUTORING ALL DEFINED AS BEING SUPPLEMENTAL TO THEIR INSTRUCTIONAL DAY. ALLOW SCHOOLS TO USE THESE FUNDS NO LATER THAN SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT ALLOW THEM TO USE IT THROUGH SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. REQUIRES THE SCHOOLS RECEIVING FUNDING IMPLEMENT A TIERED PROGRAM A SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT THAT OFFERS AT A MINIMUM. SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION TO PUPILS SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL BEING AND SCHOOL MEALS. ESTABLISHES MINIMUM STUDENT GROUPS FOR LEARNING RECOVERY INCLUDING AT RISK PEOPLE'S STUDENTS HAVE BEEN CHRONICALLY ABSENT FROM DISTANCE LEARNING AND SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERPERFORMING STUDENTS. CREATES ONE PLAN FOR TWELVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE OF RE OPENING AND LEARNING RECOVERY FUNDS FROM ALL STATE AND FEDERAL SOURCES TO BE IMPLEMENTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. CREATES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CAPACITY THROUGH EXISTING CD E. AND COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS WITH THIS LEARNING RECOVERY STRATEGY. FOR ON THAT FOR THE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION SUPPORT GRANT SPECIFIC TO RE OPENING. SB EIGHTY SIX WOULD PROVIDE TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANTS TO EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND IN PERSON CHARTER TO FACILITATE A SAFE RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WITH THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS FOR FUNDING. NO LATER THAN APRIL FIFTEENTH SCHOOL SHALL OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR VULNERABLE T. K. THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE STUDENT GROUPS. BE A STRICT PUBLIC HEALTH FRAMEWORK CALLED COHORTS. THIS REQUIRES SCHOOLS PROVIDE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO SMALL COHORTS OF VULNERABLE TO K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF WHAT COLOR CHEER THEIR COUNTY IS IN. VULNERABLE STUDENT GROUPS INCLUDE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES FOSTER AND HOMELESS YOUTH STUDENTS AT RISK OF A NEWBIE OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS STUDENTS LACKING DIGITAL ACCESS AND DISENGAGED STUDENTS FROM DISTANCE LEARNING. ADDITIONALLY NO LATER THAN APRIL FIFTEENTH SCHOOL SHALL RE OPEN AND T. PAY THROUGH SIX INSTRUCTION IF SCHOOLS ARE LOCATED THAT COUNTY IN THE RED TEAR OR BETTER. ELEAZAR ALLOWED TO OPEN SOONER WITH A COVERT SAFETY PLAN PURSUANT TO CURRENT STATE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE. IF SCHOOLS ARE LOCATED IN THE COUNTY STILL IN THE PURPLE TEAR AS OF APRIL FIFTEENTH THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR TKA THROUGH SIX STUDENTS WITHIN NO MORE THAN FIFTEEN DAYS AFTER COUNTY ENTERING THE RED TEAR OR BETTER. SB EIGHTY SIX ALSO CONTAINS PROVISIONS TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE ALREADY OPENED PRIOR TO THE LATEST CD PH GUIDANCE. SCHOOLS THAT HAVE ALREADY OPEN OR HAVE A RE OPENING PLAN BUT HAVE NOT YET RE OPENS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH. ARE ALLOWED TO ACCESS SB EIGHTY SIX FUNDS AND CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER THEIR EXISTING PLANT. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SB EIGHTY SIX AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL OR THIS BILL CREATES A TWO BILLION DOLLAR BLOCK GRANT FUNDING CONDITIONS RATHER THAN A COMPETITIVE GRANT WITH THE DEADLINE TO MEET. THE REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL ALSO COMBINES LEARNING RECOVERY RE OPENING AND FEDERAL GRANTS FOR A SINGLE TWELVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR. PURSE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND RECOVERY PLAN. SB EIGHTY SIX REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO SERVE ALL IDENTIFIED VULNERABLE PEOPLE GROUPS IN SMALL COHORTS REGARDLESS OF PUBLIC HEALTH TEAR NO LATER THAN APRIL FIFTEENTH. THIS BILL REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO REOPEN FOR T. K. THROUGH SIXTH GRADE PERSON INSTRUCTION NO LATER THAN APRIL FIFTEENTH OR ONCE IN THE RED TIER RATHER THAN GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO REOPEN FOR TEEKAY TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. ALSO IN THE PURPLE CARE. THIS BILL CREATES A MORE SPECIFIC MINIMUM STANDARDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR LEARNING RECOVERY GRANTS BASED OFF OF THE SCIENCE AND EVIDENCE. AND FINALLY SB EIGHTY SIX REQUIRES LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE COVERT NINETEEN VACCINES TO SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO ARE SERVING OUR PEOPLE'S IN PERSON. THANK YOU MISLI DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ON S. B. EIGHTY SIX. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHANG- I JUST THE JOINT CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE FAMILY AND THE SENATE HAVE REALLY JUMP STARTED THE SCHOOL RE OPENING DISCUSSION AND DEMONSTRATES. A HIGH PRIORITY EACH WITH SUN RETURNING STUDENTS SAFELY BACK TO SCHOOL- BASED ON OUR COLLECTIVE WORK AND ONE MONTH THE MOMENTUM HAS CHANGED- AND SHIFTED THE QUESTION OF WHETHER KIDS WILL GO BACK TO SCHOOL THIS YEAR TO WHEN THEY WELL. I'M SAID THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE WE BELIEVE WE SHARE THE GOAL OF ACCELERATING THIS PROGRESS. I'M AS GABLE MENTIONED ARE IN JANUARY THE ADMINISTRATION SHARED A PLAN THAT ACCELERATES AND SUPPORT SCHOOL RE OPENINGS FOR OUR YOUNGEST AND MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE. THE PLAN CENTERED AROUND SAFELY REOPENING SCHOOLS FOR GRADES- OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS AND INCENTIVIZING ELEMENTARY. SCHOOLS TO REOPEN BY FEBRUARY. BOB AND THEY TAKE A OF THE PLAN HAVE SINCE THEN. VALIDATE BY SCORING I FROM THE FEDERAL. AND BY PRESENT CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISOR DR ANTHONY FAUCI. AND THE GOVERNOR SAID LAST WEEK SB SIX DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. OR FAST ENOUGH WELL IT DOES REQUIRE SCHOOLS RECEIVING FUNDS TO OPEN AND REQUIRES IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THE RE OPENING DATE IS BY APRIL FIFTEENTH AND ONLY FOR SMALL COHORTS THAT SPECIFIED STUDENTS. AND THIS IS AT THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES UNTIL COUNTY CODE RATES DECLINE TO BELOW SEVEN PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND- THIS COULD POSSIBLY MEAN SOME STUDENTS WILL NOT BE BACK IN THE CLASSROOM BEFORE THE END. YEAR I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO BUILD ON THE GROWING MOMENTUM. THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AND OUR SHARED PRIORITY OF GETTING KIDS BACK INTO THE SCHOOL- IN SCHOOLS AS SAFELY AND QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THANKS THANK YOU MR. CABRAL NO WAY OUT. YOUR AVAILABLE ACCOUNT PUBLIC. I DON'T HAVE ANY PERMITS ROOMS AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU I'M OPENING IT UP TO MEMBERS AND QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THOUGHTS MR DAHLE. I THINK YOU'RE MISTER CHAIR AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT SB EIGHTY SIX GET SCHOOLS OPEN. IT'S ABOUT ACTION NOT JUST DISCUSSIONS- AND I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE MISTER CHAIR WE WERE VERY OPEN. TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE SEVERED ALL ALONG. WE DO NOT. YES SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO THAT IN A VERY SHORT TERM GET A PLAN TOGETHER AND GET OUR SCHOOLS REOPEN IN A SAFE MANNER AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SKETCHING OUT FUTURE VACCINES AS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR ME. YOU LOOK AROUND US. AND WE'RE NOT AROUND EACH OTHER WORDS WERE DISTANCE YOU CAN'T JUST THROW SOMEONE IN A CLASSROOM FULL THIRTY FIVE KIDS. MAYBE EVEN HALF AT SEVENTEEN. AND NOT VACCINATE THEM. WE CAN DO IT. WE'RE GETTING ABOUT WHAT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION I THINK THIS WEEK AND WE JUST SET ASIDE A CERTAIN PORTION. FOR TEACHERS. WE CAN GET THEM VACCINATED. NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE- MUCH MORE ARE SUPPORT FOR TEACHER VACCINATIONS. AND I EVEN HEARD DOCTOR FELT SHE ON TV YESTERDAY ON THE SUNDAY MORNING SHOWS THEY ASKED HIM WHAT. WOULD HE GO INTO A CLASSROOM AND TEACH. AND HE WILL ANSWER. SENATOR TEACHERS THAT'S HOW WE GET BACK. WE VACCINATE TO EDUCATE. AND I ALSO APPRECIATE- BE ACCOUNTABILITY. BUILT INTO SB EIGHTY SIX A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SAYING HEY JUST GIVE US THE MONEY JUST GIVE US THE MONEY. WELL THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE SAFETY MEASURES AND ULTIMATELY ABOUT HOW THAT MONEY IS SPENT ON LEARNING LOSS AS WELL. SO WITH THAT I JUST IN SUMMARY. I HOPE WE CAN SIT DOWN AND FIGURE THIS OUT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY I'M NOT DOWN TO LONG BEACH TODAY. IS A PRESS CONFERENCE DOWN THERE I'M NOT THERE I'M HERE. I'M READY TO CUT A DEAL AND GET KIDS. BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE THAT'S MY PRIORITY AS A PARENT OF TWO. AS A TEACHER AS THE CHAIR. OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER DONALD MR FONG. YES- I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE FOR AARON AND MAYBE ERICA CAN JUMP IN- SERVICE SO DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE CONTENT AT THIS BILL WILL NOT ONLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT THREE OF THEM BUT MAY PUT BARRIERS IN FRONT OF DISTRICTS THAT MAY HAVE ALREADY MANAGED TO BE OPEN AND FOR TRANSPARENCY AT THE SCHOOL THIS IS IN KERN COUNTY THERE BUT- SEEKING A AIVER PROCESS TO REOPEN QUICKER SO WHAT DOES THIS BILL OFFERED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WILL HELP. THEM BE OPEN SOONER THAN UNDER THE CURRENT RE OPENING FRAMEWORK- AND HOW DOES THIS AFFECT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE GOING TO THE WAIVER PROCESS WERE AWARDED CURRENTLY OPEN. STILL MAYBE ALSO WITH ERIN AND ME AND AMERICA JUMP IN AFTER THAT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO THE BILL CONTAINS VERY STRONG LANGUAGE AROUND MAKING SURE WE GRANDFATHER IN ALL SCHOOLS THAT HAVE. ALREADY OPENED OR HAVEN'T PUBLICLY ADOPTED PLAN TO RE OPEN BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO BECAUSE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND CURRENT SITUATIONS IN THEIR COUNTY SO THE BILL WOULD NOT PLACE NEW REQUIREMENTS A FOR A NEW PLAN FOR THOSE DISTRICTS WHO HAVE ALREADY. MADE THAT PLAN TO RE OPEN EVEN IF THEY REMAIN CLOSED AT THIS TIME BECAUSE OF PUBLIC HEALTH- TO ERICA G. DO YOU SHARE THAT VIEW. IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. ARE IN THE PROCESS OF RE OPENING OR- OR TRYING TO GET A WAIVER WOULD THIS. BILL PUT MORE BARRIERS OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR DO YOU SHARE THE SAME VIEW THAT. WAS JUST OUTLINED. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- MR FONG I THINK THAT- CURRENT LAW EXISTING LAW ACTUALLY ALLOWS FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY. AND I'M GONNA TURN THIS QUESTION TO MY- COLLEAGUE JESSICA HOLMES FOR SOMETHING ELSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND JESSICA HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE CONCERN BUT WE HAVE- REGARDING THE BILL AND RE OPENING FOR SCHOOL THAT MAYBE ALREADY REOPENED OR ALREADY HAVE A PLAN TO RE OPEN REALLY- ARE ARE AROUND THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE OPEN IN RIGHT HERE- CURRENTLY GUIDE- SCHOOL SAFETY HELP AND GUIDANCE ALLOWS- SCHOOL TO OPEN IN PURPLE- AND ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT IF THEY HAVE A SCHOOL SAFETY PLAN IN PLACE- THAT ARE WORKING WITH THEIR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS. WILD BILL DOES NOT TAKE THAT AWAY- BY SETTING UP A STANDARD OF AS YOU KNOW THE STATE REQUIRING RE OPENING- APPLE LOVES SEVEN PER HUNDRED THOUSAND CASE RATE UPTICK OF THE CASE RATE- AND BY SETTING A DATE OF APRIL FIFTEENTH. IN PRACTICAL TERMS WHAT THAT CAN DO IS THAT CAN- LEAD TO- SCHOOL DISTRICT AND- THEIR LABOR PARTNERS HAVING TO SIT BACK DOWN AT THE TABLE AND TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHY ARE WE OPEN NOW IF THE IF THE STATE IS ONLY REQUIRING- THAT WE THAT WE GO BACK AND READ- FOR THAT WE WAIT UNTIL APRIL FIFTEENTH SO I THINK THAT WHILE. AND THE BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE THAT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AGAIN AT YOUR AGREEMENT AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRACTICAL REALITY IS THAT MANY- SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALREADY OPEN OR HAVE PLANNED TO OPEN BEFORE APRIL FIFTEENTH OR IN PURPLE. MAY FIND THAT THEY ARE AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW HAVING TO SIT BACK DOWN TO RENEGOTIATE THOSE AGREEMENTS AND DUE. TO THE SETTING OF THE STANDARD. THE SILVER COULD JUST FALL UP JUST. AT THE PATRICIA MEAN THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. HAVE HAVE A REAL FACT IF THIS. DOES LEAD TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO ARE TRYING TO OPEN THE DELAYS THAT SO HOW WOULD THAT BE RESULT. IN FROM THE MEDICATIONS PRESCRIBED. PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON REOPENING MORE QUICKLY AND BECAUSE OUR PROPOSAL ALLOWED THEN AND IN FACT THAT THE MINIMUM STANDARD- RE OPENING IN PURPLE FOR FULL GRADE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS SUPPORTED- AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE AND THEREFORE DOESN'T SATISFY AYE DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAT WOULD FORCE- FOLKS HIT TO LOOK AGAIN AT THEIR AGREEMENT SO I THINK THAT WE STILL VERY STRONGLY THAT FULL GRAYSON PURPLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- IT IS. VERY IMPORTANT AND. SHIPPED TO PROTECT AT THE EXISTING AGREEMENT. N. SAID THE- SO I UNDERSTAND REAR A LOT ALLOWING AS GOOD AS IT TO OPEN IN FOR BOTH THE THRESHOLD IS TWENTY FIVE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. CORRECT. BOARD CENTER AND WOOD OKAY- AND THEN I GUESS THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE CERTAINLY YOU IN REGARDS TO VACCINATIONS. AND MAYBE THIS QUESTIONS FIRST ERIN AND THEN MAYBE I'LL GO BACK TO JUST GOT UNDER THIS BILL IS IT A REQUIREMENT FOR TEACHERS AND OTHER SCHOOL OR DISTRICT STAFF TO BE VACCINATED BEFORE A SCHOOL CAN OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. CAN YOU OFFER THAT CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION ON THAT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AND JUST BEFORE I GET TO THAT QUESTION JUST HURT TO REITERATE THAT THE CONCERNED ABOUT A MOVING TARGET AROUND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS AND WHEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN OPEN HAS BEEN A POINT OF CONTENTION SINCE THE NEW CD PH GUIDANCE WAS ISSUED IN JANUARY. THE NEW GUIDANCE WAS EXTREMELY MORE FIRM AND STRICT THAN ALL PRIOR GUIDANCE AND HAS CREATED A CASCADE EFFECT OF HARD CONVERSATIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ABOUT WHEN AND HOW TO OPEN AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED TO MEET THIS NEW STRICT GUIDANCE SO. UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE IS NO MINIMUM STANDARD FOR WHEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS TO OPEN SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AND THE ASSEMBLY'S PROPOSAL IN SB EIGHTY SIX IS THAT WE WOULD OPEN IN PURPLE FOR ALL VULNERABLE TKA THROUGH TWELVE STUDENT GROUPS THAT WOULD BECOME A REQUIREMENT IN PURPLE REGARDLESS OF THE CASE RATE SO THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. ARE STARTING TO GET IN PERSON ENGAGEMENT IMMEDIATELY AND THEN WE WOULD NOT REQUIRE FULL GRADES UNTIL THE RED TIER HOWEVER UNDER CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY ALLOWED TO OPEN AND- IT WOULD STILL BE A LOCAL CONTROL CONTROL DECISION ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO RECONSIDER. WHAT THEY HAVE ARE DECIDED TO DO WE ASSUME THAT THE PRESSURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WOULD MAKE THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN. SO GETTING TO THE VACCINES QUESTION IF YOU LOOK AT SECTION FOUR THREE FIVE TWO SIX BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONFUSION IN THE MEDIA ABOUT WHAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL ACTUALLY SAYS. THERE IS NO REFERENCE IN THE BUILD TO VACCINES AND THE SCHOOLS ARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES IT IS SPECIFICALLY A MANDATE. THAT COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THE BIG PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MAKE THE COVERT NINETEEN VACCINE AVAILABLE TO SCHOOL SITE PERSONNEL WHO WERE WORKING AT A SCHOOL SITE WHERE STUDENTS ARE ATTENDING IN PERSON. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THAT WHILE TEACHERS ARE ELIGIBLE CHILD CARE WORKERS ARE ELIGIBLE UNDER ONE B. WE HAVE DATA BACK FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT STATE. BOARD OF EDUCATION THAT SHOWS THAT MANY MANY COUNTIES INCLUDING OUR LARGEST URBAN COUNTIES. ARE NOT YET MAKING THE VACCINES AVAILABLE EVEN THOUGH IT IS ALLOWABLE UNDER ONE B. SO THIS BILL WOULD TAKE THAT STEP TO REQUIRE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. TO MAKE SURE THOSE VACCINES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ALL SCHOOL PERSONNEL. WHO ARE GOING TO BE INSTRUCTING IN PERSON AND WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE A CATALYST. FOR CONFIDENCE AMONGST OUR WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO RETURN TO CAMPUS BUT IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT. MORE PRESSURE ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ITSELF. SURVISCOR FOLLOW UP AND- IF A LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. OFFICE CANNOT MAKE VACCINES AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF JUST. STATE SUPPLY- SOMETHING THAT'S OUTSIDE THEIR CONTROL WHAT RESTRICTIONS AND WOULD BE PLACED. ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THIS IT DOES NOT PLACE ANY RESTRICTIONS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE LANGUAGE IS NOT A- A REQUIREMENT FOR RETURN TO WORK- REQUIREMENT FOR THEIR PLAN. THERE IS NO WHERE IN THE BILL WHERE THERE IS AN INTERSECTION BETWEEN VACCINES AND IT IS SCHOOL DISTRICT'S RESPONSIBILITY- HOWEVER WE ARE VERY IT DISSIPATING IN PARTICULAR WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT JUST LAST WEEK. ABOUT ARE GREATLY INCREASING VACCINE SUPPLY IN HIS INTERESTING CREATING A SET ASIDE SPECIFICALLY FOR SCHOOL SITE PERSONNEL THAT WE BELIEVE IS CONSISTENT WITH SB EIGHTY SIX. WE ARE DISSIPATING BUT OVER THE MONTHS OF MARCH AND APRIL THAT THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN VACCINE AVAILABILITY. FOR THESE TARGETED GROUPS. SUGGEST THE REQUIRED THIS BILL DOES NOT HAVE A VACCINE REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOLS EXPERT DISTRICTS TO REOPEN CORRECT. OKAY SAID JESSICA NOT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT BUT I AM IMPROPER PURPOSE PUTTING ON THE SPOT DO YOU. AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT IN THIS BILL. YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK THAT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF- AMBIGUITY IN THE LANGUAGE AS IT CURRENTLY IS WRITTEN. AND IT CAN BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO WE ARE CERTAINLY CONCERNED WITH THE LANGUAGE AT THE THREATEN WE ALSO QUESTIONED. THE NEED FOR THE LANGUAGE GIVEN- THAT NOW THAT THE GOVERNOR MADE- REGARDING THE FACT THAT WE ARE. GOING TO ENSURE THROUGH OUR THIRD PARTY AGREEMENT AT EVERY SINGLE COUNTY IN THE STATE IS GOING TO BE PRIORITIZING EDUCATORS. EQUALLY WITHIN THAT TIER ONE B. CATEGORY AS WELL AS THE 10% SATISFIED OR VACCINATIONS FOR EDUCATORS WHICH WE WOULD JUST NOTED NOT- SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PROPOSING FOR ANY OTHER SECTOR IN THE STATE- SO IT DEFINITELY PRIORITIZING TEACHERS- SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE FEEL LIKE THAT LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY AND CERTAINLY GIVEN THE WAY THAT IT'S CURRENTLY CRAFTING. PROVIDES A LOT OF CONFUSION TO THE FIELD- ONE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT WORDS CURRENT LAW ON VACCINATION. AND CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE VACCINATION FOR EDUCATORS TO GO BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM AND- ON THE RECENTLY REALLY FEDERAL CDC GUIDANCE OFFICE THE COURT THAT THAT MOTHER ACTIVATION CERTAINLY- IS ONE PIECE AS- WHAT CAN BE A YOU KNOW AS- A MODEL FOR BRINGING. AND TEACHERS ACK INTO THE CLASSROOM. REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES OF MEDICATING COATED FRED ARE THE OTHER HEALTH AND SAFETY FACTORS AROUND MASKING SOCIAL DISTANCING- CLEANING. AND WE CERTAINLY FEEL LIKE THOSE ARE- REALLY WELL DESCRIBED AND LAID OUT IN OUR STATEWIDE GUIDANCE. FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. OKAY SO I JUST SAY THAT THE- THE CONCERN THAT I IS. THAT THERE NEEDS TO FEED AND GRAPHIC. ON THIS- AND THE US AREA THAT THAT CLEARLY EXISTS AND TALKING TO BOTH OF YOU- AT ON BOTH SIDES. THAT YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY WANT TO ENSURE THAT DISTRICTS. HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO REOPEN WE CERTAINLY WANT TEACHERS AND STAFF VACCINATED. THOUGH COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS ARE AT THE WHIM OF. STATE SUPPLY AND SO WHAT CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER THE- CERTAINLY ALL OTHER SAFETY MECHANISMS THAT ARE IN PLACE OAK TESTING AND- PP AND SANITATION TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS. A WIDE VARIETY OF RESOURCES TO ENSURE SCHOOLS ARE REOPENED BUT- I CERTAINLY WANT TO ENSURE THAT DISTRICTS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO SELL. AND THAT WE MAINTAIN A PATH. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE PURPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY- TRYING TO BE OPEN OR WORKING THROUGH THE WAIVER PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RE OPEN AS THEY SEE FIT. LOCALLY THAT'S I THINK MY CONCERN I DO SHARE. THE CHAIRS- A PERSPECTIVE THAT WE NEED TO REOPEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHO CAN OPEN NOW SHOULD WE OPEN NOW. AND SO I JUST WANT TO POINT TO ENSURE THAT- THIS BILL PROVIDES SOME CLARIFICATION. I HAVE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS A MOTHER BILLS BUT ALL THAT ALL AT THE MEMBERS- PROCEED WITH EDUCATION BECAUSE DISCUSSION AND I WILL GO BACK TO THE OTHER BILLS. I THINK THIS VEGETABLE WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK TO YOU- NEXT WE HAVE MISTER- MCCARTY AND THE. MISTER RAMOS AND THEN MISSED RUBIO. A THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- MISTER BUDGETARY. PROMOTION I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE VACCINES- AND THEN JUST ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE OF THE DO NO HARM. AND IN SOME SPECIFICS BUT I GUESS THE BIG BIG PICTURE IS WIRY HERE BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR KIDS. ARE SUFFERING SUCH GREAT LEARNING LOSS AT HOME AND MANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE HAVE KIDS AT HOME WHO WERE DEALING WITH THIS AND- THANK YOU MY KIDS ARE FIGURING OUT. BUT A LOT OF KIDS ARE. A LOT OF KIDS WHOSE PARENTS ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WHO ARE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR HOMES- ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE I DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES- YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING YOU KNOW A GREAT GREAT IMPACT THE- PACE JUST RECENTLY JUST CAME OUT AND SAID THAT THERE'S AN AVERAGE. 30% DROP IN ENGLISH AND MATH SCORES THAT'S ONE THIRD OF ONE. YEAR LEARNING THAT'S THAT'S TRUE LEARNING LOSS WE TALK ABOUT THESE WAIVERS. THERE'S BEEN WAIVERS FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. BUT FIVE HUNDRED PRIVATE SCHOOLS SO WHO'S GETTING THE BENEFIT OF GOING BACK. KIDS WHO HAVE RESOURCES YOU LOOK AT SCHOOLS THAT ARE RE OPENING IN SACRAMENTO IN MY REGION. THEY'RE NOT IN OUR AREA IN THE URBAN CORE. DURING THE OUTSIDE AREAS. NOT ALL OUTSIDE AREAS ARE. ARE WEALTHY BUT THE MAJORITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE OPENED THAT. HAVE RESOURCES SO THERE'S A HUGE EQUITY IMPACT ON THIS AND LOW INCOME ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. OUR FOSTER YOUTH ARE FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING IT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE. THE SENSE OF URGENCY AND I WILL NOT THERE ARE SOME WHO HAVE QUESTIONED SOME OF THE FINITE DETAILS AS FAR AS- THE RE OPENING GRANTS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL DO HARM TO PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY OPEN- I THINK IT WAS CLARIFIED BY OUR OURS BUDGET STAFF MEMBER. AND WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THE SENATE TO DO A CLAIFYING AMENDMENT TO MAKE SURE. THAT DISTRICTS THAT ARE OPENING UP AND ARE ON THE PROCESS. THEY WON'T BE ANY BURDEN ON THEM WE WANT TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO SO AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A TWELVE IN RE OPENING PLAN. LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT. I WILL SAY THAT THE LARGEST DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES FRESNO. OAKLAND LONG BEACH I MAY BE MISSING ONE. THEY WROTE A LETTER TO US LAST FRIDAY AND SAID YOU KNOW WHAT. FUNDS THAT THIS IS GOING TO HELP US RE OPEN AND GET KIDS BACK LEARNING. I SPOKE TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT LAST WEEK REMINDED ME YOU KNOW WHAT. I LIKE. TO PUSH TO GET MORE VACCINES IT'S HAPPENING ANYWAY. TEACHERS ARE NOW GETTING THEIR LOTTERY NUMBERS CALLED ESSENTIALLY LIKE WE SEE HERE IN FACT WENT ACROSS THE STREET AND ACROSS THE STATE. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ASKING PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO SPEED UP A LITTLE BIT MORE. AS A SUPERINTENDENT LA PETER SAYS GIVE US TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND VACCINES I'LL GET YOU TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL WITHIN DAYS. THEIR PARENTS WILL GET BACK SOME SENSE OF NORMALCY. THIRTY JUST CAN GO BACK TO WORK THOSE THEIR COMMUNITIES CAN REBUILD AND GET THAT GOING SO. IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT AS. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH NOTED. YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT BIG DAY WE HAVE FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS. WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GIVEN THE VACCINES TO KIDS THAT TAKES OUT. ABOUT 25% OF THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION. THIRTY MILLION RIGHT. 30% OF PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT. I DON'T WANT THE VACCINE I'M TAKING A PASS FOR WHATEVER REASON NEVER NEVER ROUGHLY. NORTH OF TWENTY MILLION ROUGHLY WHO NEED THE VACCINE WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN OUT OVER SEVEN. WE'RE GIVING ONE MILLION A WEEK ONE POINT FIVE MILLION A WEEK COMING IN THIS WEEK GRANT WITH THE FIRST DOSE. BUT WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY. IT WOULDN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT. TO TEACHERS ARTICULAR NUMBERS CALL ANYWAY TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. AND PUSH IT UP FRONT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE CAN GET OUR KIDS BACK LEARNING IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING THIS BILL. FROM THE GOVERNOR THERE'S NOT A REQUIREMENTS AGAIN. AND OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD ASK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTH AND FRANCISCO JUST ASKED AS WELL. THERE'S NOT A PRE REQUISITE THE TEACHERS GET VACCINATED WE'RE SAYING WE WANT TEACHERS TO BE OFFERED NOT JUST TEACHERS BY THE WAY EDUCATORS STILL. BUS DRIVERS CLASSIFIED WORKERS INSTRUCTIONAL AIDES PEOPLE AT THE SCHOOL SITES. AS MIGHT AS BUDGET CHAIRMAN TING ALWAYS MENTIONS THERE'S LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND EDUCATORS IN CALIFORNIA FOR ALL SCHOOLS AND ANOTHER GOING BACK TO WORK. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND BOTH MET WITH A MAYBE HALF OF THOSE WE NEED. THAT'S LIKE. OF A QUARTER OF THIS WEEK'S SHIPMENT TO GET SIX MILLION KIDS BACK LEARNING OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY WHY WON'T WE FOCUS ON DOING THAT THAT'S ALL WE'RE FOCUSING ON AND ASKING. IN THIS BILL- THAT THAT THE MONIES THAT WE PROVIDE REALLY PROVIDE A ROAD MAP. FOR DISTRICTS TO RE OPEN AND TO MAKE SERVER FOCUSING ON MATTERS MOST- LEARNING LOSS OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF. I KNOW WE'RE DOING SOME SOME TWEAKS WITH THE SENATE TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP EARLIER. I WISH WE'RE VOTING ON THIS LATER TODAY IT'S TIME. I KNOW WITH THAT WITH THAT WE ARE HEARING IT TODAY THE INFORMATIONAL ITEM LIKE WE ALWAYS DO. IN BUDGET COMMITTEE. ON OUR TRAILER BILLS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO VET THESE THINGS THROUGH AND- YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WILL BE VOTING ON THIS IN THE- FLOOR IN THE COMING DAYS AND I CERTAINLY HOPE WE CONTINUE TO TALK WITH ADMINISTRATION THEY EMBRACE- THIS BECAUSE THAT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE THAT FAR APART. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE FAR PART WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR STATE. AND WITH FAMILIES AND OUR KIDS MISSING OUT SO IT'S TIME. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER BUDGET SHARE. THANK YOU MISS MCCARTY MYSTERON US. MISTER CARE LESS FOR THE- BRING UP IN IN- IN TRAILER BILL EIGHTY SIX- TALKING ABOUT THE TESTING THAT- BEING ASKED AT THE DISTRICTS AS ONCE THEY THEY REPORT POSITIVE TEST WITH THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW WITH THAT PAY FOR THE TESTING THAT THE SCHOOLS WOULD HAVE TO MINISTER. YES THE AND TEND TO THE LEGISLATION THEY ARE ALLOWED TO UTILIZE BOTH THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS AS WELL AS THE IN STATE FUNDING AS WELL AS THE SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING THAT THE RECEIVING TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THAT FOR ANY TESTING COSTS. IN OF THE FUNDING- GETS EXHAUSTED DURING THE TESTING COMPONENT THAT'S NOW BEING. INCURRED UPON AT THE LOCAL LOCAL DISTRICTS WOULD. FURTHER RESOURCES COME FORWARD- TO OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS- THE DISCUSSION IN THE CRAFTING OF THIS BILL IS THAT WE WOULD NEED TO POTENTIALLY REVISIT ALL KINDS OF RE OPENING COSTS AND LEARNING LOSS COSTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SENATE AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE JUNE BUDGET. SO THIS WOULD BE THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE IN THE FUNDING BEHIND THAT IN ORDER TO OPEN SCHOOLS THIS SPRING SO THANK YOU HAVE A MAJOR STANDING IT CORRECT AND IF THEY DO EXHAUST THAT FUNNY THAT'S THERE IT WILL BE REVISITED- IN THE JUNE A DISCUSSION DURING THAT BUDGET- DISCUSSIONS DURING THOSE TIMES. THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING YES SIR THANK YOU MY BEST A COMMENT AND THANK YOU FOR IDENTIFYING THE HOMELESS STUDENTS- WITH ON PAGE TWENTY TWO OF THE BRIEFING THAT'S THERE. AND ALSO WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS THAT WERE THERE THAT THAT MONEY'S GOING TO BE ALLOCATED TO THOSE REAS WILL THAT BE ABLE TO BE USED FOR THE LOCAL SCHOOLS TO BE ABLE TO- WORK WITH THE COUNSELORS SO THAT THOSE AT. OUR STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY CLOVER NINETEEN AND SEEING EVERYTHING THAT LIKE WE'RE SEEN AS ADULTS THAT THEY HAVE THE PROPER RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THAT A MOTIONAL- I BELIEVE TRAUMA AND MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENTS. WELL AS WE BRING THE STUDENTS BACK TO SCHOOL. CURRENTLY UNDER SB EIGHTY SIX IT'S NOT JUST- ALLOWABLE TO BE SPENDING THE FUNDS ON COUNCILLORS STAND- AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IS ACTUALLY REQUIREMENT THAT THE PLAN FOR LEARNING LOS ADDRESS THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL BEING. OF THE STUDENTS UNDERSTANDING THAT WERE COMING FROM A PLACE. OF SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA AS WELL AS LEARNING LOSS. SO IF WE NEEDED TO USE SOME OF THAT FUNDING TO- RE- RETOOL SOME OF THE COUNSELORS TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF WHAT WE'RE CHALLENGE WITH TODAY. THAT MONEY WOULD BE ABLE TO YOU'D BE USED IN THAT IN THAT AREA YEAH THAT. YES THANK YOU- ANOTHER QUESTION IS FOR OUR SPECIAL- NEEDS STUDENTS AND POPULATION I SEEN ON. ON PAGE TWENTY FOUR ITEM ONE. WHERE MONEY IS BEING ALLOCATED TOWARDS OUR SPECIAL NEEDS- A POPULATION WITHIN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CERTAINLY MENTAL HEALTH IT'S THAT AREA MAKING SURE THAT CANCERS ARE QUICK. TO DEAL WITH WITH STUDENTS IN THAT CATEGORY ALSO. BUT THE QUESTION WOULD BE- IS- ADRS INCLUDED IN THAT FOR ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MONIES THAT COULD BE USED ALSO. FOR SOME OF THOSE CASES. CURRENTLY THAT SB EIGHTY SIX DOES NOT HAVE AN APPROPRIATION FOR- ADDRESSING ADDITIONAL ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE NEEDS. FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THAT WERE AROUND COMPENSATORY EDUCATION PRESSURES. THAT IS A CONVERSATION WE WILL NEED TO BE HAVING AS PART OF THE JUNE BUDGET YES SO THAT DISCUSSION WOULD MOVE FORWARD- IN THE JUNE BUDGET BUT- THEM. BUT WE DO SEE IT AS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND OPEN UP THE SCHOOLS. YEAH CALIFORNIA YES SEE THAT'S WHY YOU SEE FOR THE MANDATORY COHORTS YOU SEE ASTON TO SPECIAL NEEDS IDENTIFIED REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR OF THEIR COUNTIES TEARS SO THE STUDENTS CAN BE. OFFERED IN PERSON RE ENGAGEMENT IMMEDIATELY. AND THEN ALSO SEE THEM AS A- REQUIRED- STUDENT GROUP WITHIN THE LEARNING LOS. I RECOVERY GRANTS THEMSELVES. WITH A KID AS WE MOVE FORWARD- MISTER CHAIR TO OUR OUR JUNE- BUDGET DISCUSSIONS I WOULD LIKE. TO CONTINUE TO BE- OF THE ON WHERE THESE DISK ARE. UP INTO THAT. MISTER I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION ON SB EIGHTY SEVEN IF NOW'S APPROPRIATE TIME ABSOLUTELY. WELL THANK YOU- AND I SEE THAT AND- SB EIGHTY SEVEN. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT LICENSE- LICENSES WAIVERS. FOR PARTICULARLY- FOR THE COSMETOLOGY LICENSES THAT ARE THERE. BUT I KNOW THAT IN MY DISTRICT THERE'S BEEN FAR MORE ON BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN. IMPACTED RIGHT COSMETOLOGY AS ONE HOSPITALITY- SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE THE INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE COME. TO LOOK AT THE COSMETOLOGY AND GETTING THOSE FEES- LICENSE RENEWALS THERE BUT NOT EXPAND INTO SOME OF THE OTHER- INDUSTRIES AND COMPONENTS I GUESS THE MATRIX. THAT WAS USED TO COME UP WITH THAT DECISION. THANK YOU MISS MISS LIAM PRODUCT. HI THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- IN PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WAY FOR WHO WANTED TO LOOK AT THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT WERE MOST IMPACTED BY- BUSINESS CLOSURES DUE TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS REGARDING THE PANDEMIC AND- WE HAVE COSMETOLOGISTS BARBERS MANICURISTS AESTHETICIANS ELECTRO JEFF- IN PARTICULAR THE THEY THEY ARE FOCUSED THERE'D FOCUS HERE AND PARTS OF THE WAY FIRST BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED- JUST AS AN AS A NO THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THIS. THE LABOR- AND FIFTY THREE THOUSAND ESTABLISHMENTS. SO QUITE A FEW INCIDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. THE YET AND WAS ANY CAN. GIVEN TO- SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE TWO SMALL BUSINESSES WHERE I'VE SEEN IN MY DISTRICT. SOME ACTUALLY AGO WONDER BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF COLD IT AND IS THAT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. WHEN THE WAIVERS AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE BEING DISCUSSED. YES THAT SECONDARY- COMPONENT OF THE FEE WAIVER IS- FOR BARS AND RESTAURANTS SYSTEMS SMALLER BUSINESSES- THERE'S ABOUT FIVE FIFTY NINE THOUSAND LICENSEES THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THAT. EXCEPT THANK YOU IT AND MOVING TO THE JUNE BUDGET IF WE IDENTIFY- MORE AREA SPECIFICALLY TO OUR DISTRICT AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE WOULD- WOULD LIKE TO BRING THOSE FORWARD THROUGH THE CHAIR TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BUSINESSES ARE ACTUALLY BEING PART OF THE DISCUSSION AS WE TALK ABOUT THE TRUE IMPACT THAT BUSINESSES ARE HAVING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU MISTER ROBERTS WE'RE NOT GOING TO MISS RUBIO. AND THEN- MISS RIVAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FROM A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED BY I WANTED TO JUST TO REITERATE- SOME OF THE POINTS I REPRESENT ELEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I% AM AND THEY L. A. COUNTY- KIND OF AREA BUT JUST. WANTED TO CLARIFY SO BECAUSE WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING REQUIREMENTS WHAT HAPPENS IF THOSE DISTRICTS DON'T COME INTO AN AGREEMENT- ARE THEY STILL REQUIRED TO. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF THERE IS NO AGREEMENT. YES THIS IS BEEN A COMMON- POINT OF CONFUSION WE'VE HEARD OVER THE WEEKEND FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS THERE IS NO- REQUIRED NEW BARGAINING AGREEMENT UNDER THE BILL. SO WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT RECOGNIZES EXISTING BARGAINING LAW AND ASK THAT THAT BARGAINING AGREEMENT BE SENT TO THE SIN TO THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO BE ON FILE. SO THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL- OUT THAT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND EXISTING LABOR LAWS THAT WOULD- ALLOW BARGAINING UNITS TO BE WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ON WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THEIR SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS SO FOR THOSE THAT ALREADY HAVE. ADOPTED AGREEMENT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE GRANDFATHERING CLAUSE IN HERE- AND SO IT ALLOWS THEM TO RESPECT THE AGREEMENT THEY'VE ALREADY REACHED THE STANDARDS THEY'VE ALREADY REACHED. AND THEN FOR THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW NEEDING TO STILL BARGAIN AND GET THAT PROCESS COMPLETED THEY HAVE A DEADLINE OF GETTING THAT COMPLETED BY APRIL FIRST IN ORDER TO POST THAT- ON THEIR WEBSITE PUBLICLY. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO BE OPENING ON APRIL FIRST. OKAY SO THEN THEN THE NEXT QUESTION IS- CAN I SEE ARE THE NEXT COMMENT OR QUESTION IS CAN I SAFELY TELL MY SCHOOL DISTRICT I HAVE A SUPERINTENDENT ROUNDTABLE ON THURSDAY CAN I STAND SAFELY SAY THAT WE WILL ALL BE OPENED- BY APRIL FIFTEENTH. I'M AYE THAT'S A WONDERFUL QUESTION THE- BILL SETS A MINIMUM STANDARD IT'S A DEADLINE FOR WHICH SCHOOLS HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN RE OPENING FUNDS. SCHOOLS ARE ALLOWED TO OPT OUT UNDER THE BILL AS IT IS WRITTEN AND SO. IF AN ALLEY A FOR WHATEVER REASON CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE OPENING THEY WILL FORFEITED THEIR SHARE OF THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS. RIGHT BUT THEN I CAN'T TELL MY PARENTS THAT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL BE OPENED BY BY APRIL FIFTEENTH. CORRECT ANSWERS NOW I CANNOT CORRECT THIS IS AN INCENTIVE NOT A MANDATE OKAY. AND THEN- ALSO IN TERMS OF THE VACCINATIONS- WERE VACCINE WHERE THE GOAL IS TO VACCINATE ALL THE TEACHERS ARE ALL THE EDUCATION. EDUCATION WORKFORCE CORRECT- BUT- HOW ARE WE TRACKING ARE WE GOING TO PRIORITIZE THOSE DISTRICTS THEY WILL BE RE OPENING. OBVERSES THOSE THAT THAT WON'T BECAUSE- IF WE'RE IF WE HAVE A MINIMUM- AMOUNT OF VACCINES. AND SOME DISTRICTS ARE NOT GOING TO OPEN A WE'RE GOING TO BE VACCINATING THAT GROUP VERSUS THE ONE THAT ARE RE OPENING- BASED ON THE GUIDELINES. YES THANK YOU THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHY THE LANGUAGE IT SAYS SPECIFICALLY IT'S FOR A PERSONALITY- ARE PROVIDING IN PERSON SERVICES. BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS A VERY WIDE RANGE OF PERSONNEL- COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROFESSORS- FOLKS IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT ARE I'M NOT PLANNING TO BE OPEN BECAUSE OF COMMUNITY SPREAD AND THERE ARE ELIGIBLE UNDER ONE B. SO THIS IS SPECIFICALLY. SAYING THEY ARE PROVIDING IN PERSON SERVICESIN ORDER TO HAVE THIS EXPDITED- AVAILABILITY TO THE FRONT LINE SO YOU WILL BE TRACKING ON THOSE THOSE DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO BASICALLY PUT IN A REQUEST- TO USE SAME WE'RE GOING TO REOPEN CAN YOU VACCINATE ALL OVER EDUCATION WORKFORCE. SO THE BILL DOES NOT PUT ANY KIND OF REQUIREMENTS OF US SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE THAT WE KNOW SO MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE VACCINATION DAYS OF APPOINTMENTS FOR THEIR STAFF. THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT REQUIRES THEM TO DO THAT- BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD WHAT O. WITH DOES IS IT RICK. THAT COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH. OFFICER TO BE A PARTNER AT THE TABLE MAKING THOSE VACCINES AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUAL PERSONAL. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN THE OTHER ON THE QUESTION- IS. THE SO I GUESS IT'S THE SAME KIND OF QUESTION. THERE IS CONFUSION AS WHO HAS TO ARE WE OPEN BY APRIL FIFTEENTH I HAVE AN EMAIL FROM MY KIDS SCHOOL THAT K. TWELVE R. K. SIX IS OPENING THIS WEEK AND THE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL KIDS- WON'T OPEN UNTIL AT LEAST APRIL FIFTEENTH. IS THAT A SET STANDARD OR IS IT DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT AREAS- HOW DOES THAT WORK YES SO THIS THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SO THE GUIDANCE THAT THEY PUBLISH THAT WAS VERY CLEAR IS A MINIMUM FLOOR FOR SAFETY. IN JANUARY- THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IT AT ALL TIMES IN HERE BUT NOT MAKING ANY CHANGES SO THE CONDITION FACT WHAT THE BILL SAYS IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE ALLOWED TO OPEN UNDER PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE YOUR REGARDLESS OF THIS BILL SO IF THEY ARE TAKING THE INCENTIVE FUNDING NOT TAKING INCENTIVE FUNDING THEY STILL NEED TO FOLLOW PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES. OKAY AND THEN- MY CONCERN IS THE LANGUAGE SAYS SHALL YOU KNOW EVERYTHING'S AS SHALLOW AS OPPOSED TO WELL AND THAT'S WHERE THE CONFUSION IS AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EITHER WE CAN CLEAR UP THE LANGUAGE OR IF I CAN ASK- JESSICA WHAT THEIR INTERPRETATION IS ON BASED ON BOTH BOTH TERMS SHALL. WHATEVER THE NEXT STOP THE SENTENCES BY THE SHALL IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE BECAUSE SHALL MEANS VERY MAY OR MAY NOT AND SOLD IF I CAN HAVE- JESSICA YOU KNOW GIVE ME HER INTERPRETATION ON. THE INFORMATION THAT YOU JUST PROVIDED I'D APPRECIATE THAT. IF SHE'S AROUND STEP. A YES AS CALLED TO PER OF FINE AND I THINK I. A LITTLE BIT OF THE AFFECT THAT. IF THE SHOW. AND WE'RE TO BE. WHICH PIECE OF THE BILL A COUPLE A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES THAT SHALL VACCINATE- YOU KNOW AND THEN SHALL RE OPEN- A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE THAT I'M SEEING HAS THE WORD SHALL AND- YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S BASED ON INTERPRETATIONS OF SOME. DISTRICTS WILL NOT COMPLY BECAUSE OF THE WORD SHALL OR- YOU KNOW OTHERS THAT WANT TO DESPERATELY RE OPENED WELL BUT HOW DO WE- IS YOUR INTERPRETATION THE SAME THAT EVERYBODY WILL BE AT SOME POINT- YOU KNOW UP AND RUNNING. SO- EIGHT DAYS OUR TRADITION OF SB EIGHTY SIX IS THAT AND IT IS AN INCENTIVE SO THAT THE SHALL. AT THE SHALL. ENTER THE SCHOOL RE OPENING APPLY TO THOSE WHO WOULD BE RECEIVING GRANT FUNDING AND THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT- THEY DIDN'T MEET THAT REQUIREMENT BUT THEN. FOR STATE SOME OF THAT GRANT FUNDING- BUT IT'S NOT NOT A SHALL INDEED MANDATE TEN SQUARE REGARDLESS WHETHER NOT THEY CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GRANT THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REOPEN TO BUT- I THINK OUR OUR INTERPRETATION ALIGNS WITH WHAT. AND WHAT NOT THE STABLE AND- DESCRIBED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THANK YOU MISTER RUBIO GOT MISS A REVERSE AND THEN THIS THERE. I WANT TO BY THANKING CHAIR MY COLLEAGUES FROM LONG BEACH IN SACRAMENTO- AND OTHER MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE AND THIS NEGOTIATION TO OPEN OUR SCHOOLS- SAFELY- I REALLY BELIEVE WE NEED TO FOCUS ON TEACHER SAFETY AND- NOT JUST TEACHERS BUT SCHOOL EMPLOYEES THEIR SAFETY AND WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE- VACCINES FOR THEM ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE BEEN HARD HIT BY COBIT LIKE THE AREAS THAT I REPRESENT SO I REPRESENT COMMUNITIES IN LOS ANGELES WHERE THE CASE THERE'S ONE IN FIVE- CASES OF COALBED. IN RESIDENTS BUT YET ONLY 829% OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN VACCINATED COMPARED TO OTHER AREAS OF LOS ANGELES THAT ARE MORAL WEALTHY COMPARED TO MINE WHERE. MUCH LOWER CASE RATES BUT HIGHER VACCINATION RATES UP TO TWENTY NINE PERCENT. ARE AND THAT CONCERNS ME WHEN WE THINK OF OUR SCHOOS ARE WE GOING TO TREAT SCHOOLS. IN OUR LOW LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE THEY GOING TO BE LAST LIKE OUR SENIOR CITIZENS HAVE BEEN LAST IN MY COMMUNITY. IN OUR VACCINATION PLAN AND SO I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT UP I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME ARTICLES THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED RECENTLY. ABOUT THE DISPARITIES IN OUR VACCINATION PLAN ESPECIALLY IN BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES- AND I HOPE THAT THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN SCHOOLS THAT- WHERE THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS ARE BLACK AND LATINO AND- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS AND BRING THAT UP BECAUSE THIS IS THE TIME. THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THAT AND PLANNING FOR THIS- SO THE I HAVE ONE QUESTION RELATED TO- PP. I'M DOES ANYONE HAVE BACKGROUND IN FUNDING FOR P. P. E. IN SCHOOLS. I HAVEN'T SEEN IT. SO WE CAN ABSOLUTELY GET YOU SOME INFORMATION ON THAT THE- PP REQUIREMENTS APPLE CLARIFIED IN THE JANUARY DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE THAT WE'VE BEEN REFERRING TO SO WE CAN ABSOLUTELY SEND YOU WITH THAT IS AT SEVEN VERY. CLEAR STRAIGHTFORWARD PP IT HAVE GUIDELINES FOR ITS SCHOOLS SPECIFICALLY. BUT THE GUIDELINES DO YOU MEAN THAT AND WHEN COULD THE FUNDING SWEAR HOW THE SCHOOLS WILL RECEIVE FUNDING FOR THAT OKAY SO- IN TERMS OF THE OF IT JUST AS BACKGROUND SO. THAT STATE PROCURED TWO MONTHS WORTH OF PP FOR ALL SCHOOLS AND SENT IT OUT DIRECTLY THROUGH THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IN THE SPRING. THEN WE ARE IN THE BUDGET ACT HAD ALLOCATED OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR- RE OPENING AND DISTANCE LEARNING COSTS ABOUT 11% OF THAT FUNDING WAS SPENT ON A RE OPENING TYPE COST LIKE PP WE CAN GET YOU THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS. AND OTHER THAN THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY REPORTING YET FROM THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT WHAT ELSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAY HAVE BEEN SPENDING IN TERMS OF THEIR PP NEEDS- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT IT'S A WAS ABOVE WHAT ADAM HAS BEEN PROVIDED SO FAR. OKAY WELL LET ME JUST SEE IF MISS LEAR MISS HOLMES ONCE AFTER THAT. I CAN ADD I CAN ADD TO. AND WHAT NEWS GABLE I THANK YOU BY SAYING THAT THE STATE HAS ALSO PROVIDED AND- AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR THEY PROVIDED THAT WE PROVIDED SIXTY DAYS WORTH OF. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO SCHOOLS. AND ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON PROVIDING ANOTHER THIRTY DAYS WORTH OF PPP AT NO COST TO SCHOOLS- IN ADDITION- THAT THE FIVE POINT THREE BILLION. I THINK THAT DIDN'T GIVE A WAS REFERRING TO THAT WE PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT WILL CONCERT WE USE- YES SOME OF THOSE FUNDS FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT- THE SIX BILLION DOLLARS. IN FEDERAL- AS AFTER AND SORRY IT THAT DAY- BUT I COULDN'T STAND FOR THIS EVENING HERE RIGHT NOW BUT- SAID AFTER FUNDS THAT HE GOT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THOSE ARE BEING. ALLEN SCHOOL THE THIS TIME YOU'VE ALREADY THE AT THE OUT. FOR THE PART EDUCATE TO GET THE OUT TO SCHOOL THE NEXT OFTEN BE- FORTY. WELL HAPPEN SIX DOLLARS IN SYSTEM. MATTER IN REGARD TO- THE- QUESTION OR EQUITY ALONG MAXINE. I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT ON THE STATE'S. PLAN FOR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION REALLY DOES HAVE A MASSIVE ACT EQUITY COMPONENT- AND- USING IT DIRT PARTY MINISTRY OR TO BE MORE CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES I JUST WANTED TO. MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS CLEAR. I'M I UNDERSTAND THAT WE SAY THAT WE HAVE AN EQUITY COMPONENT BUT I'M LOOKING AT THE DATA. AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES HAS JUST RELEASED OF DATA VACCINATION RATES BY CITIES AND COMMUNITIES IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT BY COALBED HAVE THE LOWEST VACCINATION RATE IN IN L. A. COUNTY. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT IT IS ACROSS THE STATE I'M FOCUSED ON LOS ANGELES BECAUSE THAT'S THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT- AND SO WE COULD SAY. THAT WE HAVE AN EQUITY PLAN BUT- I NEED TO SEE THE NUMBERS. AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A FEW MONTHS- WE HAVE BROUGHT THESE CONCERNS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AS LEGISLATORS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND WHAT AS LEGISLATORS WE ARE STILL WILLING TO PARTNER WE CAN HELP AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- MY TEAM AND I KNOW OTHERS. ARE READY TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE VACCINATION RATES ARE HIGHER IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HARDEST HIT BY POVICH. AND WE CAN'T JUST SAY WE HAVE AN EQUITY PLAN BUILT IN AND NOT AND THEN RELEASE NUMBERS THAT SHOW THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE- ED YOU KNOW I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR AND THEY HAVE BEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO MY CONCERNS. AND I APPRECIATE THAT- BUT- WE NEED TO DO MORE BECAUSE THE NUMBERS. AS WERE RELEASED THIS WEEKEND DO NOT SHOW THAT THE STATE HAS AN EQUITY PLAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS REAVIS FOR GOING TO GO TO MISFIRE DERIS AND THEN MR MEDINA. THANK YOU- GETTING STUDENTS BACK TO IN PERSON LEARNING- IS LONG OVERDUE AND I'VE RECEIVED HUNDREDS. OF COMMENTS AND- REALLY STORIES FROM PARENTS AND TEACHERS IN MY DISTRICT AND I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT IS GETTING US A STEP CLOSER TO OPENING OUR SCHOOLS FOR IN PERSON LEARNING. WITH EVERY VISIT THE TESTING CADENCE BECAUSE IT IS. AN IMPORTANT FOR MY DISTRICT ARE IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE SOME SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER WAIVERS SINCE FALL SOME SCHOOLS WHO WERE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE- THEY'RE APPROVED WAIVERS- WHICH THEY DIDN'T ACTIVATE BECAUSE OF THE SURGE. OR THEN PULLED- BECAUSE OF THE JANUARY JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH OR TWENTY FOURTH- GUIDELINE CHANGES SO THERE'S ALREADY FRUSTRATION WHAT I WOULD DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN IS FOR OUR SCHOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY OPEN. TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS AGAIN- THAT ARE GOING TO CREATE MORE COMPLICATIONS FOR THEM PART OF- WHAT MY QUESTION IS AROUND IS A TESTING KIT AND CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN AGAIN. WHAT SCHOOLS HAVE TO ADOPT. HAVE TO UTILIZE THE TESTING. CADENCE REGIMENT. YES OF THE WEAPONS OF THE- THE TESTING CADENCES THAT ARE PART OF THE CDPH GUIDELINES WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY ALREADY HAVE AN ADOPTED PLAN TO RE OPEN SO THE GRANDFATHERING CLAUSE THAT I REFERRED TO EARLIER IS INTENDED TO AND LEGALLY WOULD PROTECT A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT ALREADY HAS AN ADOPTED PLAN EVEN IF THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT BECAUSE OF THE TEAR THAT THEY ARE IN AND IT WAS UNSAFE TO OPEN. SO THIS FUND IS. A LOT MORE COMPLICATED ESPECIALLY FOR OUR SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE. SCHOOLS UN IS THERE A AND ON TOP OF THE TEARS- SO FOR HIGH SCHOOLS ARE SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE UNLIKE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WHEN TEARS. WHEN CASES GET TO TWENTY FIVE PER ONE HUNDRED. THEY CAN THEY CAN OPEN NOW FOR HIGH SCHOOLS AT SEVEN. PER ONE HUNDRED- I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT THIS. OUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE. AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SERIOUSLY NEED TO CONSIDER IS MAKING IT EASIER. AND LESS COMPLICATED FOR OUR HIGH SCHOOLS AND JUNIOR HIGHS TO OPEN AS WELL. MY NEXT QUESTION IS- IS THERE IN THE LANGUAGE THAT EXIST FOR IN PERSON LEARNING WHAT DOES IN PERSON LEARNING MEAN IS THERE A MINIMUM DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU KNOW A SCHOOL COULD ONLY BE YOU KNOW IT HAVE IN PERSON LEARNING AN HOUR A WEEK OR IT'S KIND OF I DON'T SEE ANY CLEARLY ENOUGH WHAT THAT MEANS. YES THERE ARE- DEFINITIONS IN THE CURRENT LAW THAT ARE NOT CHANGED IN SB EIGHTY SIX RUN THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES THAT NEED TO BE PROVIDED DURING THIS SCHOOL YEAR SO WE DID CHANGE THAT IS PART OF THE DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL SO THOSE MINUTES IF NOT YET CHANGED WHAT WE DO HERE IS TO FIND IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR TKA THROUGH SIX IS BEING UNDER THE IMMEDIATE PHYSICAL SUPERVISION OF A CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEE AND THEN FOR- OLDER GRADES FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL AND FOR HIGH SCHOOL IN THE- PHYSICAL AND- AS SPACE OF EIGHT EITHER A CERTIFICATED OR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE. TO ALLOW- FOR SAFER CONCORD TAKING OF THOSE OLDER GRADES WHILE KNOWING THEY HAVE MULTIPLE TEACHERS SO KNOWING THAT THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE IN THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF IT OF EACH OF THEIR TEACHERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT 10% OF EXPANDED LEARNING TIME GRANT FUNDS TO BE SPENT ON PARA PROFESSIONAL STAFF. MY DISTRICTS ARE CONCERNED THAT IT COULD CREATE ARBITRARY AND UNNECESSARY ONGOING FISCAL OBLIGATIONS ON WHY NOT GIVE DISTRICTS MORE FLEXIBILITY WITHOUT SPENDING. SO THE I'M INTENT IN SB EIGHTY SIX IS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN EMPHASIS ON- THE ADULTS TO STUDENT RATIOS THAT ARE NECESSARY NOT JUST FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSES- UNDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE BUT ALSO TO TRULY ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A LOT OF THE- CALL OUTS AND AROUND TO BRING. IN ONE ON ONE INTERVENTIONS AND OTHER KINDS OF SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORTS. THE UNDERSTANDING IS THE SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORTS MEAN SUPPLEMENTAL PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS SO- WE ACTUALLY ANTICIPATE A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE LEARNING RECOVERY FUNDS BEING UTILIZED FOR CERTIFICATED AND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES- THERE WAS A GREAT NUMBER OF LAYOFFS THAT HAPPENED IN THE SPRING FOR A PAIR PROFESSIONALS IN PARTICULAR THOSE WHO PROVIDE. ONE ON ONE SUPPORT FOR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS AND SO WE DO ANTICIPATE MANY MANY ELEAZAR BRINGING BACK THAT STAFFING CAPACITY IN THIS NEXT YEAR IF THERE IN PERSON IN ORDER TO MEET THE BASIC NEEDS OF THEIR- STUDENTS EYEPIECE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO TO MR MEDINA THE MYSTERIOUS. SHARE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ONE OF FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES WHO ASKED ABOUT TESTING- BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN AND SB EIGHTY SIX BOTH- MANDATE TESTING. SOMETHING THAT MY LOCAL- SIZE SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A ONE THE HIGH COST OF TESTING. AND SECOND A SOMETHING THAT I APPRECIATE AS A FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHER AND THAT IS THE LARGEST LOGISTICS OF TESTING. HOW HOW WILL- KINDERGARTEN TO SIXTH GRADERS- BE ABLE TO DO TESTING SO. IS THERE A SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE FOR ME WHAT TESTING MIGHT LOOK LIKE- IN IN A SCHOOL IN A CASE SIX A SCHOOL WHAT WHAT WOULD TESTING LOOK LIKE HOW IT'D BE ACCOMPLISHED. HI CAN I AM TURNOUT QUESTIONS MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA HOLMES. UNDER THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO AND I AM NOT- ADMITTEDLY AT A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT BUT I BELIEVE I CAN PROVIDE SOME. THEN- INFORMATION THAT COULD BE HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE AND THE ANSWER IS REALLY DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF TESTING THAT- DIFFICULT DISTRICT AND HAD ALL PROCURED OR AT THEIR AT THEIR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS- THEY'RE DIFFERENT KIND OF PASS. AND SOME OF THEM I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THE ONES THAT I'VE HEARD THAT ARE BEING USED COOL OUR CAT THERE- THAT YOU USE THE Q. TIP BUT YOU JUST PUT AT THE FRONT OF YOUR NOSE- AND ACTUALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS AND THE VIDEO ON ITS WEBSITE. I TRAINING VIDEOS FOR TEACHERS AND PER STUDENT- THAT LIKENS IT TO YOU KNOW A CHILD TAKING THEIR NOTES NETWORK- AND DAD AND IN THOSE CASES AND IF IT'S BEING DONE ON CAMPUS THE STUDENT WORKS BUT PUT THE THOUGHT IN THEIR NOSE. INTO AT AT SOME KIND OF- SHARE YOUR HOLDER BAG AS YOU KNOW THAT CONTAINER I'M IN A BILL TO BE SHIPPED OFF BY THE BY THE POOL TO THE LAB FOR TESTING ON THE OTHER YOU KNOW ANOTHER PRETTY- POPULAR OPTION AND THAT MANY FOLKS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. IT AT HOME TESTING WHERE FAMILIES AND TEACHERS AND ANYONE WHO'S BEEN TAPPED ON THE CAMPUS JUST GET ON AS A SORT OF PATH THAT IS. SPECIFIC FOR THEN THEY TAKE IT HOME THEY CAN DO THE TASK AND THEN DROP IT OFF WHEN THEY COME TO SCHOOL AND THEN WILL PRESIDENT COLLABORATORY FOR TESTING- BUT THAT LIKE I SAID THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF TASK- IT REALLY DEPENDS ON. WHO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS CONTRACTED WITH FOR THE TESTING- AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR PREFERRED METHOD FOR WHAT THEY HAVE AND WHAT THEY HAVE AGREED TO AND WITH THEIR LABOR PARTNERS. TALK ABOUT GIVES YOU A SENSE SOME SENSE OF WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE BUT AGAIN IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ACROSS THE STATE. I WOULD JUST SAY. AGAIN AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER. THE SOUNDS GOOD BUT IN REALITY THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE AT THAT CAN. FIRST GRADE TO ADMINISTER THIS TEST- I THEIR OWN I IS SORT- LOT TO OF KINDERGARTENERS AND FIRST GRADERS AND WITH THIS TESTING THEN WE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED WEEKLY. PURSUANT TO THE CURRENT STATE GUIDANCE- AND PURSUANT IF YOU ARE PROPOSAL OKAY MINISTRATION PROPOSAL FOR RE OPENING AND DOES THE TESTING WOULD BE REQUIRED WEEKLY FOR- FOR SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPEN IN THE PURPLE CURES THAT WOULD BE THE HIGHEST HERE- THE INFECTION RATE. AND IF THE SCHOOL DID CHOOSE TO DO IT AT THE SCHOOL SITE. WOULD THAT BE THE TEACHER WHO WOULD THEN BE COLLECTING THESE TESTS FROM STUDENTS. I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE AND IF IT'S NOT ON THE COOL SIDE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S AT HOME- AS YOU COULD BE SOMEONE IN THE FRONT OFFICE OR LIKE A DROP BOX FOR PEOPLE CONSTRUCT THEIR CAST OFFS THAT THEY'VE DONE AT HOME AFTER THAT THERE ARE SOME LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WHO HAVE CONTRACTED WITH. A MOBILE TESTING UNIT TO COME TO THE SCHOOL SITE AND INSTEAD OF HAVING INTERACTION BETWEEN LOOK BACK ON AND FAMILIES- DATE THERE'S JUST INTERACTION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES- OR THE TEACHERS AND THE LOCAL TESTING STAFF SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT MODEL COURT DEPENDING ON THE PREFERENCE IN OUR- OF THE L. E. A. M. I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT. THAT THIS REALLY CAN CREATE A LOGISTIC NIGHTMARE OF FOR SCHOOLS AND AS- SOME OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS. IN MY AREA POINTED OUT. SCHOOLS REALLY DO A DIFFICULT TIME NOW. YOU KNOW JUST GETTING THE FIRST GRADERS KINDERGARTENERS TO BRING AND THEIR- THE VACCINATION RECORDS RIGHT NOW SO THAT PUTTING. THAT TESTING ON THEM I REALLY THINK THAT IS- REALLY GOING TO PUT. SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT SURE- SCHOOLS ARE CAPABLE OF DOING. AT THANK YOU. THANK YOU WERE GONNA GO TO- MISS RAAS IN THE MISTER JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. HI I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING ELSE I THINK IT HELPS US TO THINK THROUGH WHAT IT IS WE'RE PROPOSING WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. SO THAT IS OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT ALSO SAYS THE QUESTIONS WERE ABLE TO AT LEAST RESPOND IN A IN A BETTER WAY. I THINK OUR IT'S CLEAR THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING DURING THIS PANDEMIC- OVER THIS LAST YEAR WE WATCHED ACHIEVEMENT GAPS WIDEN ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR. WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS WE JUST AS WAS DISCUSSED BY MY COLLEAGUE WHO HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THIS REGARD MIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM HIGHLAND. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS WIDENED EDUCATIONAL INEQUITIES FOR STUDENTS. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO LIVE IN AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE LIMITED INTERNET ACCESS. AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE CHAIR OF EDUCATION ABOUT THE FACT THAT AS LEGISLATORS WE HAVE TO GET OUR STUDENTS BACK TO CAMPUS WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN THE SAFEST WAY POSSIBLE AND LOOK AT THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR TEACHERS OR ADMINISTRATORS OR STUDENTS AND THEN. IT ALSO TALKED IT'S THE FAMILIES ALSO THAT RECEIVE THE STUDENTS BACK HOME. WE'RE ALL HEARING ALL SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND I DO WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT. WE MUST CONTINUE DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THAT IS TO COME TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE TO CREATE A SOLUTION THAT WORKS FOR OUR TEACHERS OUR PARENTS. AND OUR STUDENTS. I KNOW THAT MANYSTILL MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED HERE HAVE ALREADY MADE PROGRESS IN GETTING BACK TO LEARNING SAFELY IN THE SPIRIT OF COOPERATION WITH TEACHERS THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. MY COLLEAGUE HAS TALKED ABOUT SAMPOERNA DINO- I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE EFFORT THEY HAVE MADE THE GOOD FAITH EFFORT. TO CONTINUE THIS MOMENTUM TO TRY TO GET OUR SCHOOLS REOPENED. BUT I ALSO SINCE THE FIRST STRIP FRUSTRATION. AND IN THE COMMENTS BY MY SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS THE VARIOUS- SCHOOL DISTRICTS MIGHT YOU MIGHT. MY SOMEBODY DISTRICT. THEY TALK ABOUT ISSUES REGARDING TESTING PROTOCOLS THEY TALK ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING REQUIREMENTS EVEN FOR THEIR GRANDFATHERED SAFETY PLANS THE TALK ABOUT THE CONFUSION REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT VACCINES ARE PRECONDITION. THEY TALK ABOUT THE CONFUSION AROUND WHO MUST OPEN WHO CAN OPEN ON APRIL FIFTEENTH. THESE ARE ALL LEGITIMATE CONCERNS AND I THINK THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS BEING ABLE TO ANSWER THOSE. IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE DO KNOW WE SENSE THEIR FRUSTRATION. I DO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND LEADERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES FOR CONTINUING TO WORK ON A PLAN THAT'S- GOING TO GET OUR CHILDREN AND TEACHERS BACK. TO THE CLASSROOM IN THE SAFEST WAY POSSIBLE. THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU MR ROSE WILL GO TO MISTER JONES SAWYER. AND THEN TO MISS GARCIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- BUT I JUST WANT TO ECHO WHAT IS ALREADY BEEN TALKED ABOUT. WHICH IS THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS IF THEY COME BACK I JUST WANTED TO BE MISSED. THAT OUR- YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOW. PROBABLY IN THE MOST STRESSFUL SITUATION THAT THEY'VE EVER BEEN. EVEN IF YOUR PARENT GOES TO WORK IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE MANY FACTORS THAT HAVE SPREAD CALVET AMONG THE WORKERS. IN MY DISTRICT YOU HAVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT ONLY DEALING WITH WITHOUT CRYING BUT THEY'RE ALSO DEALING WITH WERE NOT PEOPLE BE EMPLOYED. WHEN I TO BE LIVING IN YOUR HOME AND THESE LITTLE KIDS WHOSE STOMACHS ARE PROBABLY TURNING. EVERY DAY SINCE THIS PANDEMIC BEGAN. AND IN. THE STRIKE THAT WAS DONE IN TWENTY NINETEEN- EARLY UNIFIED TEACHERS SAID THAT WE NEED MORE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS SOCIAL WORKERS PSYCHIATRISTS AND NURSES TO DEAL WITH TRAUMA THE TRAUMA INFORMED CARE THAT'S NEEDED IT WAS NEEDED DESPERATELY TWO YEARS AGO. CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW IMPORTANT IT WILL BE NOW YES IT'S GREAT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE VACCINATIONS IS GREAT WE KEEP OUR TEACHERS SAFE. BUT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS COMING BACK. MAY BE GREAT CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE THAT WE NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH BEFORE WITH BEFORE SO I AM JUST REITERATING TO THE TO THE ADMINISTRATION. AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT IT IS GREAT THAT WE GETTING EVERYONE BACK. BUT IN MY DISTRICT. AS STUDENTS COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- THE CRIME RATE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SHOOTINGS HAVE GONE UP THAT THEY'VE BEEN ENCLOSED IN ONE AREA FOR SO LONG ARE NOT- THE FRUSTRATION OF NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THE INTERNET NOT BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH DISTANCE LEARNING. GET BEHIND IN YOUR CLASSES FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT'S GOT TO BE UNBELIEVABLY FRUSTRATING FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN LAW STUDENTS OF COLOR. BUT NOW THEY'RE COMING. JUST TO BE PLACED IN A SEAT. AND NOBODY'S REALLY DEALING WITH. THE TRAUMA. THE EXPERIENCE A LOT I HOPE THAT NOT ONLY ADMINISTRATION BUT THIS BODY. MAKE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH FUNDING AND ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THAT SO THAT WE'RE NOT BACK HERE IN A YEAR TALKING ABOUT WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES IN MIND MONEY WE NEED TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW AHEAD OF TIME WE SHOULD WHICH IS TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM TWENTY. THANK YOU MISS GARCIA. THANK YOU I'M HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS AND A LOT OF QUESTIONS A LOT OF QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN ASKED ALREADY BUT- I JUST WANTED TO GET THE STEP A MOMENT AND TAKE A STEP BACK AN THINK ABOUT THE ROLE OUR SCHOOLS PLAY. OUR TEACHERS PLAY ARE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES PLAY IN OUR STUDENTS LIVES AND OUR SOCIETY OUT THERE. WE ARE ALL TALKING ABOUT ARE GETTING THEIR STUDENTS BACK BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE THINK ABOUT THE MANY ROLES THAT ARE. TEACHERS PLAY I WAS A MATH TEACHER FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND MY JOB IS NOT JUST TO TEACH A CORE DATA FORMULA OR NUMBERS. A SPACE A LITTLE BUT PROVIDE A WHOLE- SUITE OF SUPPORT FOR OUSTED AND FAMILIES OUT THERE WE'VE ASKED. ARE IN. MAKE ADJUST AND HAVE. TO ADJUST TO- VIRTUAL LEARNING AND THEY HAVE TO ADJUST TO A BLENDED SYSTEM AND THEY HAVE. WE'RE ASKING THEM NOW TO RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM AND AS A TEACHER AND ALL MY FRIENDS ARE TEACHERS THEY'RE READY TO GO BACK TO THE CLASSROOM THEY KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT. BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED AND THEN I BRING SOMETHING HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES ALONG THE WAY. AND SO AS WE MOVE BACK THINGS UP AND MOVE THEM TO THE LIST I ON MAKE SURE THAT IT'S EQUITABLE. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO TEACH IN SOME OF THE HARD HIT COMMUNITIES- MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND MY COMMUNITY I FEEL OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR SISTERS AND BROTHERS AND THINGS STRUGGLE OUT THERE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE SEPARATED BY MANY FREEWAYS. ALONG THE WAY BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF INFECTIONS OF DEBTS THAT SOME OF THE LOWEST RATES OF VACCINATION IN MY HOME TOWN. WHAT ABOUT 7% THAT'S NATION RATE OF OVER THE TOP TEN MOST AFFECTED CITIES- IN L. A. COUNTY OUT THERE. BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE INEQUITIES DEEPER WE KNOW WE HAVE A DIGITAL DIVIDE YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN EDUCATIONAL GET THAT'S ONLY BEEN GROWING. AS I WAS REALLY AT THIS I THINK WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE SCHOOLS IN THE HEART OF THE COMMUNITIES HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED AFTER FRONT OF THE LINE. FOR VACCINES AND I TO FIND A LINE TO GET THE TEACHERS BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM. BECAUSE THEY WE'VE ALL OF THEM WERE VERY FOLLOWING NOW IF I EQUITY AT THE OF EVERY DISCUSSION FOR A YEAR. WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANYTHING EQUITABLE SEEING SCHOOLS IN PREDOMINANTLY HIRING COMMUNITY OPEN UP ALREADY- AND WE'RE GONNA BE AT THE END OF THE LIST ONCE AGAIN AND SO. AS WE DO THIS WE NEED TO THIS IN A SAFE WAY. IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE ARE PREPARED SUPPORT. EDUCATORS AND SCHOOLS BE SIX. AND THAT WERE PARTNERS THEM. AND SO AFTER A LOT OF THE NOW AGAIN ONE MORE TIME. OF DAY I THINK IT'S A- WE DON'T FORGET THE ROLE THAT. AND THERE WAS. THAT THE SOME. THIS OUR- AND THE RESPECT THAT THEY- TO BE. WITH US. WITHIN MINUTES. WITH LEGISLATURE OUT THERE. THERE NOT A SINGLE TEACHER IT'S- TO WHO. DOESN'T SEE THEM. OF OUR SCHOOLS. OUT THERE BUT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE SO. I HAVE. TO SAY THAT I TALK TO TEACHERS IN MY BACKYARD AND THEY'RE LIKE WE WANT TO GO BACK. WE ARE STRUGGLING THE KIDS ARE STRUGGLING. BUT THEY'RE AFRAID WHEN THEY SEE THE RATES OF INFECTION CIVIL ART AND- LIKE YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU ARE AFFECTED I SAID YES YOU KNOW WHAT. THURSDAY I'M AFRAID TO WALK OUT THE DOOR TO WALK MY DOG. SENSING FAT AND DAY- AND NOT THE WAY OF. KEEPING MY MORE BY. THEY FOR A REGULAR. LIKE TOO MUCH THE STRESS YOU HAVE AS RESCUE TO. BACK AND SAY I THINK THEY GO SHE'S. CONTINUE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE HASN'T BEEN. I OTHER MINORITY IN A LONG TIME THAT IS THE- YEAR. WE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO RETHINK AND TO DO A- BUT YOUR ONLY GO TO DO ABOUT. IF YOU'RE AT AT. IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING AND TALKING TO US BECAUSE WE HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO GIVE YOU SOLUTIONS. BUT LET ME BE CLEAR I HAVE NEVER FELT LIKE WE'RE HAVING THE CONVERSATION TO ME. I IN ANY OF THIS PROCESS OUT THERE. I'LL I WANT TO BE YOUR PARTNER. I WANT ADMINISTRATION TO BE. ATTENTIVE TO MY COMMUNITY AND AT THIS TIME THIS. HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE. YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. AND THEN. TALK TO WORK. SORRY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- I THINK FIRST I WANT TO AGREE WITH THE CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS I THINK AT THE BEGINNING THIS IS WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY- THERE WAS MONIES EXPENDED IN THIS LAST BUDGET THAT WENT OUT TO EVERY SCHOOL. AND THE REALITY IS SOME SCHOOLS DID A LOT BETTER JOB THAN OTHERS AT ATTEMPTING TO RE OPEN. AND SPENT THOSE VITAL DOLLARS TO HELP GET YOUR KIDS BACK INTO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS BEST AS POSSIBLE. AND LARGELY THAT WAS IN RURAL AREAS. LIKE I REPRESENT. MANY SCHOOLS AND IT'S NOT THAT THEY HAVE LOWER CASE RATES I HAVE TO COUNTIES HAD THE HIGHEST TEST POSITIVE HIGHEST TEST POSITIVITY RATE IN THE NATION. AT ONE POINT. SO HAD HIGH RATES OF TRANSMISSION. BUT THEY FALL THE SCIENCE. CDC YOU SAID MONTHS AGO THAT YOU CAN SAFELY REOPEN YOUR SCHOOLS WITH MODIFICATIONS. AND SO MANY OPEN WHEN THE HIGH AND A HYBRID SYSTEM WITH MODIFICATIONS THEY BUT THEY HAD TO EXPAND THE MONIES TO MAKE SURE THEIR SCHOOLS WERE READY AND THEY COULD DO THE PP AND ALL THE DEVICE AND- ALL THE THINGS THAT WENT ALONG WITH IT. AND YET IN THIS. IN THIS BUDGET BECAUSE OF THE LCF FORMULAS IT IS. THESE SCHOOLS GET UNDERFUNDED SIGNIFICANTLY. AND IF WE'RE GONNA GO ON THIS ONE OF MY BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL RIGHT NOW AS IT IS IF WE'RE GOING TO GO AND SEND THAT SAME MONEY BACK OUT TO DISTRICTS ON THE LCF FORMULA. THOSE RULES RULES SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO GET UNDERFUNDED AGAIN AND EVEN GROSSLY. EVEN MORE GROSSLY DISPROPORTIONATE WAY WHEN THEY ACTUALLY MANY OF THEM WERE THE ONES THAT SPENT THE MONEY TO RE OPEN WELL SOME OF THE VERY LARGE URBAN DISTRICTS DIDN'T OPEN AT ALL AND TOOK THOSE FUNDS JUST AS THE CHAIRMAN SAID. TOOK THOSE FUNDS DID NOT REOPEN IT WAS NOT ACCOUNTABILITY SO WE NEED TO MAKE THAT RIGHT AND THERE'S BEEN TALKS ABOUT THIS ALREADY IT NEEDS TO GET IN THIS BILL ABOUT EQUALIZE FUNDING IN A MINIMUM FUNDING FOR THESE RURAL SCHOOLS. WHO TALKED ABOUT MAYBE UNDER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE A MINIMUM FUNDING LEVEL TO EQUALIZE THE DISPROPORTIONATE FUNDING THAT IS THE RESULT OF PUTTING THIS OF A PORTION IT OUT ON LCF FORMULA. ALONE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THAT WE CAN REALLY TALK ABOUT EQUITY. IN ENSURING THAT BECAUSE WE ALL EVERY SCHOOL FACE THE SAME THINGS. WITH COVER NINETEEN. AND WE SHOULDN'T BE TREATING SOME DISTRICTS AND GIVING THEM LESS MONEY TO DEAL WITH THAT SAME VERY ISSUE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WERE THE ONES THAT DID THE WORK TO RE OPEN WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- RIGHT NOW. I THINK THE PROBLEMS IS REALLY. INCONSISTENCY AND I WANT TO GO BACK- TO. THE ADMINISTRATION. BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENTS TO RE OPENING RIGHT NOW IS THE BLUEPRINT FRAMEWORK. QUITE FRANKLY. AND IT WAS SAID EARLIER THAT- UNDER PURPLE TIER THAT ALLOWS SCHOOLS THE FLEXIBILITY TO RE OPEN THAT'S NOT TRUE. AND K. THROUGH SIX CAN OPEN UNDER A WAIVER. THAT'S IT BUT IS IT NOT TRUE WHEN I WAS ASKING A MINISTRATION THAT SIX TO TWELVE. IF YOU DID NOT REOPEN YOUR SCHOOL IN THE FALL. WHEN IT WAS IN RED DEER. IF YOU ARE IN THE PURPLE TEAR RIGHT NOW YOU CANNOT REOPEN YOUR SCHOOL. UNDER PURPLE TEAR FOR SIX TO TWELVE IS NOT CORRECT. I HAVE A QUESTION TO JESSICA HOPELESS. YEAH AND JESSICA HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- AGAIN AS NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT BUT AND IS IN REGARD TO THE SIX THROUGH TWELVE QUESTION- YOU CAN OPEN THE FOR COHORT MOSCOW COURT A STUDENT- AND- CASE RATE PURSUANT TO THE CURRENT GUIDANCE IF YOU ARE ABOVE TWENTY FIVE- BUT SHIFTED REMIND FOLKS YOUR CONTACT AND- THAT PER. THOUSAND POSITIVE TEACHER UNDERSCORE AND THEN IF YOU'RE ABOUT. TWENTY HUNDRED THOUSAND- THAT'S CURRENTLY A DELL- THE GREAT SIX WHICH. IN RIGHT HE YOU CAN HELP YOU CAN UP C HùI BUT YOU CAN DO A HIGH RE OPENING AT IN PURPLE TO YEAR CAREER. WELL GREAT BUT IT'S YES. RIGHT SO THIS IS THE DISPARITY THAT WE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SO SCHOOLS THAT RIO IN HIGH IN THE- AND THERE'LL. TO SAY OPEN. AS LONG AS THEY OPEN IN THE FALL ALL THESE COUNTIES ARE IN TEAR. THERE'S STILL IN PURPLE TEAR BUT SOME. SCHOOLS ARE ALLOWED TO BE RE OPENED UNDER THEIR METRIC. BECAUSE THEY RE OPEN IN THE FALL BUT IF YOU DIDN'T REOPEN YOU CAN'T REOPEN NOW. IMAGINE THAT. THE DISPARITY THERE THEY'RE THEY'RE THE SAME TYPE OF SCHOOLS. SO IT'S EITHER OKAY TO OPEN IN PURPLE OR IT'S NOT BUT AS THERE'S NO CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BOARD SO I HAVE DISTRICTS THAT ARE READY TO RE OPEN. SIX THROUGH TWELVE AND THEY CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE THE PURPLE TIER SYSTEM FRAMEWORK. WHICH RIGHT NOW THIS BILL DOES NOTHING ABOUT. AND I THINK WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THIS TIERED FRAMEWORK IS CREATED INCONSISTENCIES AND DESPITE DISPARITIES ACROSS. IT'S A GOOD THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR GOT TO SET THIS UP ARBITRARILY USING HIS OWN PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. HIS OWN SCIENCE AND NONE OF US WERE INVOLVED IN THAT DISCUSSION AND THOSE AND NOW WE HAVE SCHOOLS THAT. SAME COUNTIES. SAME RISK. BUT SOME GET TO BE OPEN AND SOME DON'T. THAT'S WRONG YOU KNOW WE NEED TO FIX AS IT. DISPARITIES WE ALSO I MEAN TESTING TESTING IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER DISPARITY AND WE BROUGHT IT UP TODAY. SO UNDER THIS BILL IF YOU OPEN BEFORE MARCH FIFTEENTH OR IF YOU'RE ALREADY RE OPENED. OR IF YOU HAVE A PLAN BY MARCH FIFTEENTH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEST. NO TESTING REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER IF YOU IF YOU'RE A SCHOOL THAT IS UNABLE TO REOPEN FOR WHATEVER REASON MAYBE THEY DON'T GET IT TO A BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH YOUR LOCAL UNION. IN TIME. BUT IF YOU'RE A DISTRICT THAT COMES AFTER MARCH FIFTEENTH. YOU ARE GOING TO BE UNDER THE TESTING REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS WEEKLY IF YOU'RE A PURPLE TIER AND EVERY TWO WEEKS. UNDER READ HERE. NOW IS THAT CORRECT I'M JUST GONNA ASK BOTH ERIN. AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT CORRECT. WITH WITH THE A CAVIAR THAT IF YOU WERE IN THE PURPLE TEAR THAT THERE IS A PROCESS OF THE BILL BY WHICH YOU HAVE TO RUN YOUR A SAFETY PLAN BY THE SCHOOL SAFETY. TEAM THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED THE STATE LEVEL- IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS ADEQUATE FOR SAFETY PURPOSES. CORRECT RIGHT BUT IF YOU IF YOU ARE ALREADY OPEN. FOR YOU HAVE A PLAN BEFORE MARCH FIFTEENTH YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO TEST DO A SYMPTOMATIC TESTING CORRECT. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY HAVE A PLAN ADOPTED IN PLACE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU'VE OPENED BY MARCH FIFTEENTH YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW THE NEW CD PH A SYMPTOMATIC TESTING CURRENT AND IF YOU'RE A SCHOOL THAT DOESN'T AFTER. YOU WILL HAVE TO NOTE THERE'S NO IF ANDS OR BUTS ABOUT IT YOU WILL BE TESTING. RIGHT THAT IS WHAT IS IN THE GUIDANCE YES OKAY. ADMINISTRATION DO YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT IS THAT WHAT THIS PROVIDES. WE DON'T DISAGREE ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOTE THAT AND THE PURPOSE BEHIND AND- YOU'RE GRANDFATHERING IN FOLKS WERE OPEN- IS THAT THEY HAVE A TRACK RECORD THAT WE CAN LOOK AT IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY THE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY HAVE HAD OUTBREAKS THERE LOCAL. I'M DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WOULD GO IN AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOUR OR ASK THEM TO CLOSE- FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- HOWEVER IF THEY'VE BEEN OPERATING WITHOUT OUTBREAK- FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAN IT IT AND THEY'VE BEEN YOU KNOW COMPLYING WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. WHEN THEY HAVE THAT AND HISTORY AS BEING OPEN AND BEING UNSAFE IN PERSON THAT- YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO DISRUPT- FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T THEY DON'T HAVE THAT HISTORY OF BEING OPEN AND SAFE AND SO IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE. HEALTH AND SAFETY PARAMETERS TEMPLATE THAT ARE NOT JUST ARBITRARY THAT ARE SUPPORTED BOTH BY THE OF THE CDC AS WELL AS MANY SCIENTIFIC REPORTS WE HAVE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE. AND TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN OPEN RECENTLY AND NOT CALLED OUTBREAK THE NON THAT THAT IS REASONING. THAT OKAY LONG LONG ANSWER BUT SAME RESULT GUYS YOU'RE GOING TO SOME. THAT WILL REQUIRE TO DO A SYMPTOM TEST. AND OTHERS THAT WERE HAVE. A AND OTHERS THAT WERE HAVE TO. WRITE AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO USE VITAL. THAT WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT TO PAY FOR THAT TESTING. YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE A DISPARITY THERE AND IT'S A DISPARITY THAT WE DON'T NEED. BECAUSE CDC DOES NOT REQUIRE YOU TO DO TESTING. CDC DOES NOT REQUIRE YOU TO DO A SYMPTOMATIC TSTING AND THE EXPERIENCE ACROSS THE NATION. AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN IS THAT YOU CAN OPEN SAFELY WITHOUT A SYMPTOMATIC TESTING AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN OUTBREAKS. AND IN FACT THE FACTS ARE. IN THOSE SCHOOLS THE RATE OF TRANSMISSION IS MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT WE SEE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND AGAIN CITY SEES BEEN SAYING THIS FOR MONTHS DOCTOR FELT YOU HAD A MUCH PUBLICIZED. CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF. WHERE HE SAID YOU CAN SAFELY REOPEN SCHOOLS EVEN WHERE YOU HAVE HIGHER RATES OF COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION. AND THE GOVERNOR SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THIS AND YET HE HASN'T CHANGED THIS IN HIS CDPH GUIDELINE PROTOCOL. AND HE'S GOING TO REQUIRE SCHOOLS THAT ARE THAT ARE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH. TO GO AFTER THAT MARCH FIFTEENTH DATE AREN'T OPEN IN SCHOOLS TO THEN ABIDE BY THIS TESTING PROTOCOL THAT ISN'T NECESSARY. AND THAT IS COSTLY. SO WE NEED TO STOP HAVING THESE DISPARITIES THAT I THINK A LOT OF US HAVE HAVE TOUCHED ON YEAH IT IS SAFE TO OPEN SCHOOLS WE KNOW THE MITIGATING STRATEGIES SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY EMPLOYING THEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO AND BEGIN THE REAL IT. MANY SCHOOLS OF ART OF YEP AND I THINK WE COULD HAVE RE OPENED OUR SCHOOLS. TWO MONTHS AGO. WE COULD HAVE BEEN HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS MONTHS AGO WE SHOULD TO COME TO A TO. A DETERMINATION MONTHS AGO TO DO THIS I RECOGNIZE A LOT OF AS WE CAN BEEN BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR. REFUSES TO MOVE. YEAH FROM HIS OWN POSITION FROM AN ARBITRARY WAY OF DOING THIS. THIS RESULTED IN OUR STUDENTS LANGUISHING. AT HOME AND NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND OUR PARENTS ARE FRUSTRATED AND RIGHTFULLY SO. SO THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE AND I AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE US MAKE THOSE CHANGES TO ENSURE THIS IS EQUAL ACROSS THE BOARD THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE. DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND EVEN IN THE SAME COUNTIES WHERE ONE SCHOOL IS ABLE TO DO THIS BUT ANOTHER SCHOOL HAS TO DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I DON'T WANT TO CREATE THAT KIND OF SITUATION. THANK YOU DR WORK. YES I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR THANK EVERYBODY FOR THIS DISCUSSION A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT I HAD WALKING IN HAVE BEEN ANSWERED- HOWEVER I DO HAVE SOME SOME THAT THAT DO LINGER- A FIRST OF ALL HI. MY DISTRICT. I HAVE LIKE OVER EIGHTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS EIGHT ZERO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. MANY OF THEM ARE TINY AND WHAT I HEAR FROM THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS- DISTRICTS THE SCHOOLS IN THE FIVE COUNTIES I REPRESENT IS THAT THAT LARGE LARGER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN URBAN AREAS ARE THE ONES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RE OPEN THE ONES THAT ARE OUT IN THE MORE RURAL AREAS ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO RE OPEN. AND PART OF THE CONCERN IS AROUND THE CADENCE FOR TESTING. AND THE CHALLENGE OF GATHERING THE TESTS AND EVEN GETTING THEM TO BE PROCESSED IN A TIMELY WAY- EVEN IN UNDER A HYBRID LEARNING SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT. LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW DIFFICULT THAT MIGHT BE IN DEL NORTE COUNTY RIGHT NOW- FOR THIS NORTH COUNTY NORTHWEST COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN'T GET FROM NORTH TO SOUTH ON ANY GIVEN DAY BECAUSE THE ROADS CLOSED. WOULD HAVE LANDSLIDES FOR THE LAST WEEK SEVERAL WEEKS. YOU COULDN'T GET A TESTING YOU CAN GET TRANSPORTED IF YOU DOUBT IF YOU WANTED TO YOU DID MAYBE YOU COULD FLY IT OUT. SO THAT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T- EXACTLY- DO ANYTHING TO LOWER THE COSTS FOR THAT. AND SO- SO THERE'S THERE WE CERTAINLY HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT AND THE DISPARITY. AND THEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THE CADENCE TESTING- THE ENORMOUS COSTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THEY'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF MONEY FOR THAT- IN NOT TO IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE SHOULD THEY HAVE TO UNDERGO SOME OF THE KEY THE TESTING CADENCE THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED- APPRECIATE WHAT I DID. I'VE HAD PARRAMATTA CONFUSION- BUT IT IT CLEAR FROM NOW BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT. AND NEW M. O. USE. THAT MIGHT HAVE TO BE DONE- WHICH DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE HAPPENING AND SO THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL- THERE'S CONCERN THAT VACCINES WOULD BE REQUIRED- EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE TO BE REQUIRED TO BE VACCINATED AND THAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE THE CASE SO THERE'S A LOT OF CLARITY THAT'S COME OUT OF THIS TODAY. BUT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW CHALLENGING THIS CAN BE. ONE AREA THAT IS A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR US. AND WE TALKED ABOUT PARA PROFESSIONALS- YES THERE MAY INDEED HAVE BEEN PARA PROFESSIONALS THAT WERE LAID OFF IN A LOT OF DISTRICTS. BUT ON ANY GIVEN DAY IN A LOT OF MY DISTRICT THEY COULDN'T HIRE PREPARE PROFESSIONAL. IF THEY WANTED TO BECAUSE THEY DON'T EXIST. THEY DON'T EXIST YOU CAN'T GET THE STAFFING THAT YOU NEED. AND YET IT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED MY UNDERSTANDING UNDER THE LEARNING LOST PART OF THIS BILL THESE BILL. IT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED SO IF YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE TO HIRE HOW DO YOU HIRE THEM WHAT DO YOU DO IN THOSE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND DOES THAT MEAN THAT THAT ARE DISTRICTS FURTHER LOSE OUT- SO I'D LOVE TO KNOW. IF YOU CAN'T HIRE PARA PROFESSIONALS. ARE WE GOING TO JUST BE MORE DISPROPORTIONATELY DISADVANTAGED IN ART AND SOME ARE RURAL AREAS SO THAT'S THAT'S MY QUESTION. SO THE LANGUAGE IS THE BILL AS YOU SAID DOES REQUIRE THE 10% OF EACH ELLIE AS LEARNING LOSS FUNDS BE UTILIZED FOR THESE PERFECTION ALL'S. AND OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T AND SAY EXACTLY WHICH TYPES OF SERVICES AS PER PROFESSIONALS WOULD BE PROVIDING- BUT IN THIS SCENARIO YOU DESCRIBE IF AND ONLY A- COULD NOT FIND ANY PARA PROFESSIONALS TO HIRE OVER THE- COURSE OF THE GRANTCHESTER SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THEN PRESUMABLY THEY WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SPEND A PORTION OF THEIR FUNDS. UNDER THE WAY THE BILL CERTAINLY WRITTEN SO THAT WOULD BE A DISPROPORTIONAL. DISSIPATE DISADVANTAGE TO IN A RURAL AREA SIMPLY COULDN'T FIND THAT STAFFING BECAUSE. IT DOESN'T EXIST IN SOME OF THESE AREAS. SO WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS IF IT COULD BE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT'S THAT THAT THAT JUST CAN'T HAPPEN OR WON'T HAPPEN. FLEXIBILITY THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO ALL THE THINGS WE DO IN THIS BUILDING. REALLY REALLY DISPROPORTIONATELY DISADVANTAGED RURAL COMMUNITIES THEY REALLY DO ON A DAILY BASIS. AND YOU CAN TAKE THESE THINGS THESE KINDS A DISPROPORTIONATE THE DISADVANTAGING AND YOU CAN TRANSLATE THAT TO URBAN CENTERS AS WELL. UNDER SERVICED URBAN CENTERS LIKE IN LOSE IN AND MISSED RIVAS IS DISTRICT AND IN MANY OTHER MEMBERS DISTRICTS IN HERE. SO IT'S IT IS IT FEELS IN MANY WAYS THAT. THE RICH GET RICHER. AND THOSE THAT ARE STRUGGLING CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE. YOU CAN YOU CAN EVEN ADD INTERNET ACCESS TO THAT TOO BECAUSE I KNOW IN SOME OF HER AREAS AND SOME OF THE OTHER OTHER MEMBERS IN HERE IN LARGER URBAN AREAS THEY DON'T HAVE INTERNET ACCESS EITHER AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WORK ON THAT DISTANCE LEARNING PART OF IT. SO WE NEED FLEXIBILITY. AND ALSO RECOGNITION THAT LIFE IS DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE AND THAT'S OFTEN WHAT'S MISSING FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS. I JUST WANNA CLARIFY JUST BASING YOUR COMMENTS DR WOULD SO AGAIN IT'S ONLY A TEN PERCENT- IT'S ONLY ARE MEANT FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SO THIS IS. FOR BILLION ON TOP OF WHAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY GET THROUGH L. C. F. F. SO IN A SENSE WE BELIEVE IT'S MUCH EASIER IF THEY ARE GOING TO GET ADDITIONAL THIS IS ADDITIONAL IN PERSON. IS NOT MEANT TO BE FOR A INTERNET COMPANY- LET ME LET ME JUST FINISH AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE A COMMENT. SO AGAIN- WE THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR SET ASIDE BECAUSE IT'S MUCH EASIER FRANKLY. TO GET- PERRIS HIRED THEN TEACHERS HIGHER AND SO. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING IN PERSON EDUCATION THOSE ARE REALLY YOUR- BRITISH FORCES A LETTER TELLING ME IN YOUR COMMUNITY. YES I THINK IT'S HIGH TEACHER THAT WE CAN A DIFFERENT THIS CALL IS NOT EASY TO HIRE TEACHERS EITHER I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU COULD YOU COULD SAY THE SO YOU HIGHER PARRIS THROUGH AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO THROUGH TO- DISTANCE LEARNING. IT DOESN'T WORK IN A LOT OF AREAS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DISTANCE LEARNING. SO YOU CAN EVEN HIRE THE PEOPLE. TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE BECAUSE IF YOU HIRE THE% PEOPLE THEY COULDN'T GET TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT BUT BUT AGAIN THIS IS SAM. THIS IS FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SO I KNOW THIS COULD BE CONTEMPLATED FOR SUMMER SCHOOL SO YOU COULD HAVE THE SAME PARENTS WERE WORKING FOR YOU FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR. TEACHERS SUMMER SCHOOL. YOU COULD HAVE. THE SAME PARENTS WERE WORKING FOR YOU DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR- BE PART. OF THE SUMMER THE FOLLOWING YEAR OR AFTER SCHOOL SO THIS IS NOT. SAYING YOU HAVE TO GO HIRE ANYBODY JUST GIVES YOU. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON TOP OF YOUR NORMAL. SCHOOL DAYS COULD BE SUMMER. COULD BE AFTER SCHOOL BEFORE SCHOOL. THIS IS MEANT TO BE ON TOP OF ALREADY WHICH AGAIN FOR ELSE SILVA. AND I AND I PRAY AND I APPRECIATE THAT I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO USE. YOU KNOW. TECHNOLOGY FOR SOME OF THE PARA PROFESSIONAL. DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S WINTER OR SUMMER. WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO IT EITHER. SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT USING TECHNOLOGY THE WHOLE POINT OF. THE WAY THAT THIS PROPOSALS WRITTEN IT'S MEANT TO BE IN PERSON WE'VE SEEN. WELL WHAT DISTANCE LEARNING DOES. AND SO WE ARE RICH. THE ABILITY TO DISTANCE LEARN IT IS MEANT FOR IN PERSON THE MAJORITY LARGE MAJORITY OF IT IS MEANT FOR. IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. IT AGAIN THERE'S NO THERE'S NO DEBATE ON THE FLOOR AROUND IN PERSON. CONSTRUCTION WORK YOU KNOW THAT'S NEVER BEEN A DEBATE. THAT'S BECAUSE THE COLDER THAT WE ALLOWED. TO HAVE DISTANCE LEARNING BUT IF IT WERE NOT COLD AND WE WERE WITH HIM THERE WAS NO INTEREST IN REVISITING- IN PERSON WE ALL WE ALL BELIEVE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THAT'S WHAT THE PARENTS BELIEVE THAT TEACHERS BELIEVE THE TO THE SUPERINTENDENTS BELIEVE WE ALL BELIEVE IN THAT SO- THAT THAT'S THIS MONIES. IS GO BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. BUT I GUESS I WOULD JUST ADD THAT. WINTER SPRINGS FALL WE STILL HAVE DIFFICULT HIRING. OF MATTER SEASON IS AND DOESN'T. IT'S STILL A CHALLENGE AND SOME OF OUR DISTRICTS. THANK YOU- MRS- AND THEN DISTRICT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND I WANT TO SAY ALSO THANK YOU TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE- BROUGHT UP A VERY LIVELY DISCUSSION ON THE ISSUES OF SCHOOL RE OPENING IDEA I HAD SOME QUESTIONS AND FOR NOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS FOCUS ON. SB NINETY FOUR- ON THE- SMALL BUSINESS LICENSING FEE. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IF I CAN GET ADDRESSED. MISTER TRAILER FROM YOU OR YOUR STAFF OR ANYONE- FROM THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT LISTEN AGAIN. ON SECTION TO BE FOR. SAYS THE DEPARTMENT SHALL NOT REFUND ANY LICENSE RENEWAL FEES PAID BEFORE. THE ENACTMENT OF THIS SECTION OR THE SUBMISSION OF A WAIVER. REQUEST BY A LICENSEE. SO COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WHY IS THIS LANGUAGE PROHIBITING THE DEPARTMENT FROM ISSUING RETROACTIVE RELIEF FOR. STRIDES THAT WERE CLOSED BY THE STATE FOR MOST OF LAST YEAR- AND TO WOULD BE FOR PROHIBIT RESTAURANTS- INCLUDING MANY THAT WERE YOUR PERMANENTLY CLOSED DUE TO THE PANDEMIC FROM SEEKING REFUNDS FOR THE FEES PAID IN TWENTY TWENTY. I'D LIKE TO HAVE CLARIFICATION- ABOUT THIS AND- WHAT D. OR WHAT THE INTENT IS BECAUSE IT DUE TO THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS PENDING ON THIS ISSUE WITH THIS LANGUAGE DISRUPT SOME OF THESE CLAIMS AS WELL. IF YOU CAN CLARIFY THAT FOR ME I'D VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. SURE THIS IS ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- AT THAT THAT SECTION IS REALLY JUST TO SAY THAT AND- WE WILL BE ISSUING REFUNDS IF HE'S HAD ALREADY BEEN PAID BUT THAT GOING PROSPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING YEAR- A WAIVER COULD BE PROVIDED- IT SHOULD NOT INTERRUPT ANY KIND OF LITIGATION. THAT WHAT YOUR QUESTION. SO SUCH A WHAT ABOUT FOR PREVIOUS YEAR. THE PAIN FOR LIFE LIFE PAID LESS YEAR WHEN MORE THAN NINE MONTHS OF THE YEAR MANY BUSINESSES WERE SHUT DOWN WHAT HAPPENS THEN. CAN THEY GET- A CREDIT TOWARDS A FUTURE YEAR. THAT THE DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. SURE I'M AND ANY OF THE WAIVERS WOULD ACTUALLY BEGIN MARCH FIRST OF THIS YEAR AND SO THOSE THAT WERE PAID IN THE PRIOR YEAR CRACKED WILL NOT BE REFUNDED- I WILL TURN THIS QUESTION OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AMY TRAVESTY SHE HAS ANY FURTHER DETAILS PROVIDE THANK YOU. IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT FINANCING HAVE ANYTHING TO IT IS TAX BUT- CLARIFY THE- IS MAKE IT. THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ISSUE REFUNDS FROM THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL I'M AND THAT IS PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF IT SYSTEMS NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT. AS WELL AS CONCERNS ABOUT HOW YOU TRACK AND MONITOR ALL OF THAT SO PERSPECTIVE LEE WAS THE APPROACH WE CHOSE TO TAKE IN THE SITUATION. SO MISTER TERRY DO YOU MIND IF I CONTINUE WITH THANK YOU. UP SO THEN TELL ME IF YOU DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF. HOW MANY DOLLARS WERE COLLECTED BY. RESTAURANTS FOR EXAMPLE AND I RAISE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE AS AS IMPORTANT AS THE EDUCATION PIECE HAS BEEN. RIGHTLY MOST OF THE CONVERSATION HAS BEEN ON THAT FRONT. I REPRESENT ALONG WITH SOME OF US HERE AT EIGHT EIGHT PART OF CALIFORNIA THAT. IS VERY MUCH ORIENTED IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND IS HEAVILY IMPACTED. WHEN ESPECIALLY A LOT OF THESE RESTAURANTS. CATER TO THE INDUSTRY- HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN- AND- IN GENERAL JUST. A PART OF CALIFORNIA THAT THAT PROVIDES A AND FOOD AND RESTAURANTS. ARE A BIG PART OF THE ENTERTAINMENT- IS I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND FOR THESE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN SUFFERING AND- IT'S ONE THING FOR PROSPECTIVELY TO ADDRESS THIS BUT- CAN WE- HAVE WE DONE ENOUGH. TO RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY HOW MUCH IS THE AMOUNT. THAT FOR LAST YEAR THESE BUSINESSES WERE SETBACK. FOR THE ENTIRE STATE DO WE HAVE A NUMBER. AND THE END JUST FOR CLARIFICATION I DON'T COULDN'T SPEAK TO THE ACTUAL REVENUE THAT THOSE AT RESTAURANTS LOST IN TERMS OF. HOW MUCH REVENUE THEY LOST AS A RESULT NO I'M SORRY I GUESS I DIDN'T ASK IT. SIMPLY ENOUGH WHAT IS THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE GENERATED BY THE STATE BY THESE LICENSES. FOR LAST YEAR. IT'S ROUGHLY FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY OKAY. AND IF WE HAVE A RECORD OF WHO'S PAID. I UNDERSTAND THE TIMING OF IT ME. GIVEN THE- CONTINUOUS CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO I. T. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WE MAY NEED TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS. BUT WHY NOT AT LEAST LOOK AT. EVEN IF IT'S NOT REFUNDING BY GIVING THEM CREDIT TOWARDS SOME OF THEM HAVE LOST THEIR BUSINESS COMPLETELY MAY WANT TO PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE AND FIGURE OUT OPENING UP SOMETHING IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS YOUR TO WHY NOT GIVE THOSE BUSINESSES THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CREDIT. TO NOT. INCUR AN ADDITIONAL COST- FOR ALL FOR ALL THE BRICK AND MORTAR COST THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHEN SETTING UP A NEW BUSINESS. SO I'M I'M I'M ASKING THAT FOR BOTH BUSINESSES WERE PERSONALLY SHUT DOWN BUT ALSO BUSINESSES THAT STRUGGLING BY NOW AND LITTLE BIT OF AN INJECTION MONEY. OR CREDIT TOWARDS A FUTURE YEAR WOULD WOULD GO A LONG WAY. AND WHAT I DO THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE HADN'T WITH ALLEGE OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AGREED TO PROVIDING TWO YEARS OF REALLY FOR THESE BUSINESSES RATHER THAN JUST THE ONE THAT WE HAD A PROPOSED IN JANUARY- SO THAT IS ONE ELEMENT RIVER TRYING TO ADDRESS IT. I'M I ALSO THERE'S STOP RESOURCES AND COSTS TO THE STATE ALSO OF REFUNDING THOSE. THOSE I FEES THAT WERE PAID PREVIOUSLY BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WERE REALLY JUST TRYING TO PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE REALLY FOR THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE STILL IN OPERATION I'M SORRY RECOGNIZE. THE SERVICE LET ME LET ME INTERRUPT YOU I DON'T% FIND THAT ARGUMENT BEING. VERY THE BEST ARGUMENT TO USE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE STAFF TIME TO REFINE FOLKS. THAT HAVE BEEN- THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES. FIND THAT TO BE A VERY GOOD ARGUMENT I DON'T- EXPECT. FACT ME READ THIS AGAIN THE- SHALL NOW. REFUND ANY LICENSE RENEWAL FEES PAID BEFORE THE IT NACHMAN OF THIS SECTION. SO THEN FOLKS THAT BUSINESSES THAT HAVE PAID THIS FEE. FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE YEAR BUT WEREONLY ABLE TO OPERATE FOR TWO AND A HALF MONTHS OF THAT YEAR ARE NOT GOING TO SEE ANY BENEFIT FOR THE REMAINING NINE AND A HALF MONTHS. OF THE FEE THAT WAS PAID. SO I'M ASKING CAN WE HAVE THIS. SECTION CHANGED. EVEN IN A CUT IN THE FUTURE BILL IN A IN A IN A FUTURE TRAILER BILL. OR OR OR MAYBE EVEN OFF ON THIS. TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. GIVE APPROPRIATE CREDIT BACK TO BUSINESSES FOR LAST YEAR. NOT FROM THE TIME OF THE ENACTMENT OF THIS BEFORE LAST YEAR. HI THIS IS DIRECTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AGAIN I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL WAS FOR A SINGLE YEAR ANDREW NEGOTIATIONS WE HAVE EXTENDED IT TO TWO YEARS BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT TWO OTHER. PROPOSALS WITHIN THIS PACKAGE WHICH HELP TO ADDRESS THE THOSE SAME SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IN REGARDS TO GRANT DOLLARS- AND TAXI RELIEF SO AS A PACKAGE THERE ARE MULTIPLE PROPOSALS THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO HELP MANY IN SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. OKAY WELL I GUESS I'VE MADE MY POINT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR AT THIS POINT. IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA WAIT AND SEE AND LOOK AT HOW. THIS EXACTLY ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THERE'S AMBIGUITY AND NOT CLEAR- WHAT WHAT GOOD QUESTION ALSO THAT WAS NOT REALLY ANSWERED WAS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL THIS LANGUAGE. IS GOING TO IN ANY WAY IMPACT THE CLASS ACTION WITH THE- WITH THE LAWSUITS THAT ARE PENDING RIGHT NOW. DOES IT DO THAT. HI ERIC LEAGUE AND- NO THIS THIS LANGUAGE IS NOT. INTENDED AT ALL TO INTERFERE WITH THOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MR THANK YOU MR WITH THE MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUGGEST TAKING MEMBERS WERE VERY ROBUST DIALOGUE ABOUT ALL THE THINGS WE ARE VOTING ON. TODAY AS WELL AS THE RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION I THINK IT WARRANTS ARE. OUR INTERROGATION OF THE PLANET WARRANTS ARE CRITICISMS OR WARTS ARE- CRITIQUE OF THE PLAN BECAUSE IF WE DO MOVE BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IT WILL BE A SINGLE MOST DRAMATIC COVED ADAPTATION WE'VE HAD. THIS WHOLE OVER TIME WE ARE APPROACHING ONE YEAR OF THE COVER TIMES AND AT LEAST THIS COUNTRY AND IT'S IMPORTANT MEMBER AS I HEAR A LOT OF GREAT COMMENTS- REMEMBERING THAT THERE IS A GREAT TRAUMA TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO OUR STUDENTS RIGHT NOW. IS THAT THE VIRUS THAT STILL RAGES IN THIS COUNTRY. AT PERHAPS EMBARRASSMENT TO THE DEBT THE END TO THE ENTIRE DEVELOP THE WORLD IN THIS COUNTRY. IS THE CAUSE OF ALL OF THAT THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE MUST REMAIN VIGILANT ABOUT IT WHY WE HAVE HYBRIDISE SUCTION WIFE TO COURTS. AND MY FRANKLY LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE MIGHT BE. IN THREE MONTHS GRADUATING INTO AN ECONOMY THAT HAS NO JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM THAT HAS MADE SO THEY COULDN'T SEE THE ELDER RELATIVES WHO PASSED AWAY. AND PERHAPS EVEN LESS OPPORTUNITY THAN EVEN THE GENERATION MY GRADUATE GENERATION HAD EVEN LESS THAN THAT BEFORE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WHILE WE MUST FIGHT FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION RETURN TO THAT SENSE OF NORMALCY. IT WILL NOT SHORT. UNTIL WE DEFEAT THE VIRUS IT WILL NOT CURE ALL THOSE ELEMENTS OF THOSE PROBLEMS ARE EXISTING UNTIL WE- UNTIL WE COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESSED THE VIRUS. AND ALL ITS IMPACTS THAT'S WHY I'M REALLY GLAD WE'RE VOTING TODAY AT LEAST ON THE BIG PACKAGE OF STIMULUS. DIRECT PAYMENTS TO WORKING FAMILIES DIRECT PAYMENTS SMALL BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH IN THE DISTRICT LIKE MINE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST TO WORKING CLASS FAMILY WILL EVAPORATE IN RENT. PROBABLY IN HALF A MONTH AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL EVAPORATE IN COMMERCIAL RENT AND LESS THAN THAT. WELL IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT ONE TIME. RELIEF IT'S STILL RELIEF BUT WE NEED TO BE DOING HOPEFUL THE FOUNDER OF. WILL BE HELD HELPING US OUT. FOR FILLING THEM NOW. WELL WE WAIT FOR CONGRESS. TO APPROPRIATE WARM DIRECT TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN NEED. AND THAT'S WHY LOWER VOTE ON THE STATE'S WORKING- EARLY ACTION. WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SCHOOL RE OPENING AS I'VE EXPRESSED BEFORE AS WE SHOULD NOT BE MOTIVATED BY AN ARBITRARY CALENDAR IN THE DAY. YES IT'S THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR IS COMING AND THE MORE TIME WE WAIT THE MORE MORE TIME WILL BE WASTED. BUT I'M REMINDED THAT EVEN IN MY DISTRICT IN FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT LAST WEEK THERE WAS A- SURVEY RELEASED OF TEN THOUSAND PARENTS AND 63% OF THEM SAID THEY DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE. PUTTING US IN A BACK IN IN PERSON TRACTION THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S A CHOICE RATES AT LEAST IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE IT A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. PUBLICLY HEALTH SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS OUR FAMILIES AND OUR EDUCATORS OF COURSE. I'M AND OF COURSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FAIR CRITICISM I THINK OF THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT ITS ROLE IN THE VACCINES. AND HOW THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR A PLANNED SINCE LAST YEAR WHEN THIS VIRUS BEGAN. WHAT WOULD THE PLAN BE WHAT WOULD THE STATE WIDE STANDARD B. AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING SO UNITED. THE UNITED THAT UNITES THE GOVERNOR. THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE OPEN SAFELY AGAIN. SO I'M WONDERING. COULD THIS IS A QUESTION I THINK IT'S FOR OUR COMMITTEE. COULD WE PUT IN THE BILL. TO WELFARE AS A CIVIL OR L. O. CON. ESTIMATE MORE OBVIOUS THERE'S BEEN IN OTHER OF A EQUITY IT AND SOMETIMES ARBITRAGE. OF I'M CERTAIN TAG OF AKI. BEING BONTA THE LIST ARE BEING PUT ON THE- COULD WE NOT SINCE WE HAVE. THE URGENCY AND THE DRIVE TO MAKE SURE OUR STUDENTS GET BACK TO THE CLASSROOM. TO PRIORITIZE BYLAWS A MANDATE. THAT OUR EDUCATORS ARE TEACHERS OUR GENERAL STAFF ARE CLASSIFIED STAFF. ARE PRIORITIZE FOR THE VACCINE. IS THAT SOMETHING WE COULD DO. THAT'S ACOSTA. I GUESS THAT IS ONE OF PROVISION OF SB SIX CHANGE. THAT SCHOOL PER. WHO ARE PROVIDE. SIR IN PERTH TO STAY. REGARDLESS WHETHER THAT'S ON CAMPUS. OR I'M IN A LEARNING HUB OR YOUR FOOD DISTRIBUTION SITE. THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE PRIORITY FOR VACCINE ACCESS UNDER ONE B. OKAY THAT'S GOOD. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU THOSE ARE HABITS. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MEMBERS OF IT WOULD BE REELECTED OF ME NOT TO. DIVE BACK INTO SOME OF THE POINTS MADE BY- OUR COLLEAGUES MR GALLAGHER AND MR WOODS IN REGARDS TO THE RURAL. DISTRICT ISSUES. MY COLLEAGUES ARRIVE THERE'S A HUGE DISPARITY HERE. AND WHAT REALLY CONCERNS ME IN WHAT IS OFTEN MISSED. WHEN DISCUSSING OUR SMALL RURAL SCHOOLS IT IS THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITIES TO DO ALL OF THESE THINGS. SO WHAT ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS THERE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HERE FOR THEM. AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE FOR THEM TO EVEN GET THAT. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO- IN ADDITION TO THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THE- DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IS ALREADY BROUGHT ONLINE SO THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS BROUGHT AT PEDIATRIC HEALTH AND SCHOOL BASED SAFETY EXPERTS ON BOARD AND ARE WORKING IN REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE TO PROVIDE THAT INTENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AROUND. THE PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICES WHAT SB EIGHTY SIX DOES THEN IT ASKS ATTY- ADDITIONAL- WAY OF HAVING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THROUGH THE REGIONAL LEADS ACROSS THE STATE AROUND EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE IN A TRAUMA. INFORMED ENVIRONMENT SO HOW DO YOU ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS AND THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF STUDENTS IN A COVERT ENVIRONMENT TO HELP ADDRESS THEIR LEARNING LOSS IN A WAY THAT IS BASED OFF THE SCIENCE AND BASED OFF OF BEST PRACTICES THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOT RECREATING THE WHEEL. AND ISOLATION SO THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE UNDER SB EIGHTY SIX WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. I UNDERSTANDABLE BUT TO DOCTOR WOODS POINT HI HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET OUT THERE. I HAVE I HAVE AREAS IN MY DISTRICT. THAT MY I'VE GOT SCHOOLS THAT ARE TWO HOURS AWAY FROM COUNTY CENTERS SUMMER THREE FOUR HOURS AWAY. THEY DON'T HAVE. INTERNET SERVICE THEIR FAMILIES DON'T HAVE INTERNET SERVICE SO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL PLAN. TO REACH THE I HAVE AREAS THAT LIKE DR WOODS. WHO ARE DEALING WITH. MUDSLIDES LANDSLIDES SNOW IN ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT IT OTHER SITUATIONS. STILL RECOVERING FROM WILDFIRES SITUATIONS. WHO CANNOT BE REACHED EASILY THESE ARE VERY ISOLATED COMMUNITIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND NEED HELP IN THEIR KIDS DESERVE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOLS WHILE. BECAUSE THE DISTANCE LEARNING DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT INTERNET ACCESS. SO THEIR FAMILIES ARE HAVING TO DRIVE. IN OUR TO A SCHOOL TO GO PICK UP A PACKET SO THEIR KIDS CAN LEARN IN THERE DOING THIS. IN AND I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND. I WENT TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IN A THREE CLASSROOM SCHOOL THAT WAS K. THROUGH SIX. OUR PRINCIPAL WAS ALSO THE FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE TEACHER. WHO ALSO DID ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK- ALSO DROVE ONE OF THE BUS ROUTES. THESE PEOPLE WEAR MULTIPLE HATS. AND I KNOW A MAJORITY OF OUR LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE WE THEY'VE YET ANOTHER RIVER TO LIVE DID OR NEVER EXPERIENCED OR NEVER SEEN IT. THESE PEOPLE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE TIME. OF THE DAY. TO PUT ALL OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER. TO DO THIS SO TO SAY YES THERE'S GOING TO BE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THAT THAT'S GREAT TO SAY IT. BUT WHO'S ACTUALLY GONNA SHOW UP AND HELP THEM DO THIS. BECAUSE THAT. IS AN EQUITY ISSUE. BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT TOO. AND I DON'T SEE THAT IN HERE WHICH IS WHY I'VE GOTTEN A PHONE CALL THAT I'VE GOT AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE THESE GIANT NASCAR. FIRELESS FROM ALL OVER DIFFERENT SCHOOLS. OUR PARENTS ONCE YOUR KIDS GO BACK. I'M A PARENT I WANT TO SEE MY KIDS GO BACK. BECAUSE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS BUT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES. IN AN EQUITABLE WAY. SO IT'S FAIR WHAT A LOT OF YOU CONSIDER SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND MY LARGER CITIES. MOST OF MY SCHOOL- LITTLE COUNTY IRELAND SCHOOLS. SOME OF THEM STILL HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WATER. WE HAVE ALL THESE ISSUES THEY STILL HAVEN'T GONE AWAY. SO WE APPRECIATE THE ISSUES WHAT YOUR RECOMMENDATION. WE NEED WE DON'T WANT TO THE MR CARE WE GOTTA GET ASSISTANCE OUT THERE. BECAUSE WE CAN'T SIT HERE AND SAY HEY WE'RE GONNA THROW TWO BILLION DOLLARS AT IT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO UP HERE ALL THE TIME FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE. WE THROW MONEY AT A PROBLEM WE HAVE SOME GREAT TALKING POINTS FOR SOME GREAT HEADLINES MISTER CHAIR. BUT OUR PEOPLE IN OUR RURAL AREAS STILL GET LEFT BEHIND. AND WHAT ASSISTANCE ARE YOU LOOKING FOR. DANNY THE HELP THAT THAT'S TO GET THE DAILY IF YOU HAVE TO COMMUNICATE THAT YOU HAVE GIVE US JUST PHYSICS REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY WE ARE COMMITTED. YOU'VE HEARD OF OTHER MEMBERS. KNOW WHAT I HEARING IS. THE SYSTEM THE TO WORK WE ALL A REAL SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE SO US WHAT TO DO. ABSOLUTE AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE ON NASCAR IS. WE WANT FLEXIBILITY THE GUY FLEXIBILITY ASM. I THINK WE JUST FINISH MY POINT WE ALREADY THE LETTER. I GOT FIVE BILLION. COMPLETELY FLEX AND DON'T HAVE SO OF. SO THAT WORK. WE HAVE SOME SCHOOL OPEN AS MR GAL SAID. AND THOSE CLEAN TO SCALE AND THEN WE HE- ALL WE CAN'T LET OTHER IN PURPLE TEAR LET LIKE MY TESTER. OPEN BECAUSE THERE'S A WRECK SHOWING THEY CAN DO IT. ALL OF THE SCHOOLS THAT OPEN OPEN DURING TO. AND THEY DEVELOP THAT OWN RECORD. SO WHY IS IT WE LET HIM OPEN. OTHER TEARS. ON A DIFFERENT- OF RULES IN THIS IS PROBABLY KEEP CHANGING THE RULES. CHAU UNTIL WE STOP MESSING WITH WITH ALL THE RULES WE ACTUALLY DID. FOLKS IN THERE PHYSICALLY IN THERE THAT CAN HELP. AND WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES AND SIT DOWN. WITH THE FOLKS IN OUR RURAL AREAS IN IN MAKE SURE THESE THINGS GET PLANNED OUT CORRECTLY WE'RE GONNA HAVE IN IN EQUITY WE'RE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE GETTING LEFT BEHIND. NOW I I'LL ALSO THE- GONNA SWITCH GEARS HERE. BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK TO WOOD MISTER NAZARIAN SAID. IT AS FAR AS WE'RE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO REFUND ANY OF THESE BUSINESS LICENSES AND ABC LICENSES BECAUSE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM THEY THEY HAVE I. T. ISSUES. THIS IS ANOTHER ISSUE I'VE BROUGHT UP SINCE I GOT ELECTED. I REMEMBER SAYING HEY HOW CAN WE DON'T HAVE AN APP FOR THAT HOW COME OUR- BUREAUCRACIES ARE RUNNING ON ANCIENT COMPUTERS. WHO CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF THANKS. SO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. WHAT ARE WE GONNA FIX. OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. AS AN ADMINISTRATION WHEN ARE WE GOING TO FIX THIS. BECAUSE WE CAN GO INTO THE DMV WEBSITE CRASHING. IN THE DISPARITIES THERE. DON'T GET ME STARTED ON ET DE. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WHEN WE DID THE VACCINE ROLLOUTS. ARE TWO ONE ONE SYSTEM. NOW. WE CAN'T EVEN GET ABC LICENSES TO TRACK WHAT KIND OF COMPUTERS DO WE HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT WHAT TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY ARE WE USING. BECAUSE ALL I EVER HERE'S WE HAVE THESE IT ISSUES I. T. ISSUES I. T. ISSUES. WHAT WHAT SYSTEMS ARE YOU GUYS USING. ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LET ME JUST. OFFER A LITTLE CONTEXT- MANY OF THE SYSTEMS THAT THE STATE USES FOR A LOT OF VERY COMPLICATED PROGRAMS WERE BUILT. TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO- AND THERE THESE PROGRAMS ARE VERY COMPLEX AND ANY TIME CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE- THE SYSTEMS NEED TO BE RE PROGRAMMED SO SIMPLY THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME- AND THEN. THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND PERSISTENCE AND PROVIDED- OF. NEW WAYS IN WHICH DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT BUILDING THESE COMPUTER SYSTEMS GOING FORWARD BUT THE CURRENT SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE MANY OF THEM ARE VERY OLD AS YOU MENTIONED THE SYSTEM I THINK THE- ARE EXAMPLES- BUT IT WOULD ALSO TURN TO SOME OF THE MORE NIMBLE SYSTEMS. AND APPLICATIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT SUCH AS MY TURN AND SAY SCHOOL SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL HAN. EVEN THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN AT THE DEAN- WEBSITE- DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE- THAT WE ARE TO. SO THEY- PERSPECTIVE LEGAL IMPORT. THANK YOU MAY MISTER CHAIR EIGHT IN IN MEMBERS I THINK IS WE TRY TO PULL THROUGH THESE COVERT SOME WE NEED TO AT IT IS WE GETTING OUR OUR JUNE BUDGET. IS WHAT ARE GONNA DO FIX THESE TWENTY YEAR OLD COMPUTER SYSTEMS. WHAT WE'RE ALL WALKING AROUND WE WE'VE GOT OUR- SMARTPHONES WE'VE GOT OUR TABLETS. MAKE SURE WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST TECHNOLOGY AT OUR FINGERTIPS. THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE THE SYSTEMS THAT THEY DEPEND ON. THIRTY YEARS OLD. MENTIONED THIS OVER THIS WHEN I FIRST GOT IN. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY HERE WE ARE TWENTY ONE. IN THE SYSTEM STILL HAVEN'T BEEN TOUCHED. BECAUSE WHAT WE HEAR IS IT'LL COST TOO MUCH MONEY OF I REMEMBER THOSE BUDGET CONVERSATIONS. I REMEMBER BEING TOLD ALL ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. YOU'RE JUST YOUNG MILLENNIAL GUY. EASY NOT EVERYTHING IS A GO TO ENACT. NOT ONE OF US CAN STAND HERE AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT IF WE HAD A BETTER SYSTEM. OUR PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE GETTING SERVED BETTER. WE WOULDN'T HAVE THESE EDT MASSES WE WOULDN'T HAVE DIEM BE SHUT DOWN WE WOULDN'T HAVE ALL OF THESE THINGS WOULD HAVE SYSTEMS THAT CAN ACTUALLY TRACK. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON AND SERVE OUR CONSTITUENTS. MEMBERS I'D A BACON PLEAD OF YOU AS WE APPROACH JUNE WE FIX THOSE COMPUTER SYSTEMS. SORRY THANK YOU- WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO MR FONG. I THINK IT IS FAIR- I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DEBATE ON THE- THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF A REAL BRING OUR SCHOOLS SO I JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT EVERY MEMBER GOT A CHANCE TO- TO COMMENT AND ASK QUESTIONS I DO WANT TO JUMP TO SOME OTHER- THE OTHER BILLS ON THE- FILE. SO IF I COULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON SB EIGHTY EIGHT- CERTAINLY THAT THIS BODY HAS BEEN VERY OUTSPOKEN HAVE REGARDING THE- THE FAILURES OF THE EDT. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT PROMISES TO HELP THOSE STRUGGLING DURING THE PANDEMIC ONLY TO BEING WITH WITH INEFFICIENCIES OF FRAUD SO WHAT PROVISIONS AND SAFEGUARDS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. TO ENSURE PAYMENTS AND REALLY FOR SENT TO THE APPROPRIATE RECIPIENTS AND WHAT A FOUR CENT. CAN BE GUARANTEED. YEAH CERTAINLY WITH A DIFFERENT OF FINANCE- POPULATIONS WHICH- WILL BE INTEREST. OF THE- A BOTH. FOR THE EITC ACTC. WILL WELL ACTUALLY HAVE- TAX FILES. THEN TO THOSE PAYMENTS WILL GO OUT AND SELL THEM. YOUR TAX ARE RECEIVED THERE'S- DEFINITELY A DIFFERENT DEGREE OF VALIDATION. FOR THAT AND IT SEEMS- BECAUSE WORKS A SIGN. HE POPULATE THE ARE NOT- DOES ALREADY KNOWN. SO IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE YOU WANT THAT YOU UP OKAY. SO WE'VE LEARNED A LESSON THAT THE BEEN AND IT'S GONNA BE FROM MADEIRA POSIT SOME AND THERE ISN'T A TO BE THE SAME. SEN THE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS WILL BE PROVIDED I BELIEVE THROUGH- ETT- FOR THE CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY DISCUSSING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- ASSIST. SOME. OKAY THANK YOU THIS IS IN A THAT THE THAT THE FULL LENGTH WOULD BE CONCERNED IF SO IF ANY INFORMATION OF AS AS THAT HAS THE OZZY LONG AS A CONTINUE WOULD BE A APPRECIATED- IT'S JUMPING TO S. B. EIGHTY FIVE. CERTAINLY THERE'S A OF CONTRA AND ON WHAT WE NOW AND- THE LACK OF THE AUTHORITY THE SECTOR STATE'S OFFICE HAD- FROM I JUST. ON THIS CONTRACT WITH- THE POLITICAL FIRM- SKG K. FOR VOTER OUTREACH WHICH- UNFORTUNATELY I WILL USE THE FUNDS TO FOR PARTISAN PURPOSES- HOW DOES THIS BILL CLARIFY- THE LEGAL QUESTION THAT DOES THAT WE GOT WE GOT INPUT FROM THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE- HAD- AND IN TERMS OF. HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE PUBLIC CONTACT. SURE ACTUALLY THE FINE- THE AMENDMENT IS THERE IS CAR FINANCE. IN NATURE IT DOESN'T THAT THIS OF STATE HOUSING FOR ACCORDING TO EIGHT WHAT WE DO TO BE ON THE CALL. FOR SERVICE THAT HAVE BEEN- PROVIDED TO THIS- SO WE IT'S A TECHNO THIRTY DAY ON- A PRIOR. ALLOCATION A NOW IN A PART. OKAY SO IT IS BUT IT IS. THAT WITH THE REASON WHY WE'RE DOING THIS GRAPHIC WAS THAT. THE PREVIOUS. AT THE WASN'T ATTIC. I THINK THERE WAS CONCERN COMING FROM THE CONTROLLER THE STATE CAN AND THAT WE ADDRESS THROUGH THE LANGUAGE YES- CERTAINLY THIS IS A CAN. PROVISION JUST BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF. HI- OVER STATEWIDE FROM THE FROM FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR BUT- IS THERE ANY TIME OF. A OR OVERSIGHT SOBRE TO ENSURE THAT IN THE FUTURE THAT THE TYPE OF STATE FUNDING ISN'T TO BE USE FOR. POLITICAL ACTIVITY OR PARTISAN ACTIVITY. YEAH I I'LL I'LL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE OF NW JERSEY FOR MORE DETAILS ON THE ACTUAL- EXPENDITURE IN ORDER WITH THE TIME. SO ANY JERVIS FROM FINANCE FUNDS. AND YOU KNEW IN THAT THEY IN RESPONSE TO. THE STATE FOR VOTER EDUCATION OUTREACH AS A RESULT OF CORONAVIRUS MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE WHAT THE VOTERS HAD COMFORT IN OUR ELECTION PROCESS AND CAME OUT AND VOTED AND SO WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THIS BEING AN ISSUE. AND WHEN WE ORIGINALLY WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE SEPARATION- WELL WE STATED THAT THE FUNDS WERE FOR COUNTIES THE AND ULTIMATELY WHAT THE STATE SECRETARY OF STATE DID SORRY WITH- AND ENTER INTO A STATEWIDE CONTRACTS- FOR VOTER EDUCATION OUTREACH PROVIDE A CONSISTENT MESSAGE. STATEWIDE IT DID RESULT IN THE HIGHEST TURNOUT VOTER TURNOUT SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY TWO WITH SEVENTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION VOTERS OR NEARLY 71% OF ALL ELIGIBLE REGISTERED. VOTERS PARTICIPATING IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. OKAY I MEAN I THE CHALLENGES THAT HIS IS YOUR THE WAS THERE YOU OF A STATE OF MONEY. TO GET OUT THE VOTE AND I THINK THAT CREE A LOT OF- BANKS AND- FRUSTRATION AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THIS TYPE OF- FUNDS SO OF. I APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY TROUBLING TO MYSELF AND SOME OTHER MEMBERS SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT- FOR THE ANSWERS IN THE GANDER- IN TERMS OF JUST JUMPING OVER MY LAST COMMENT AND JUMPING BACK INTO THE SCHOOL DISCUSSION- I DO JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT MR VICE TRIES TO HAVE MY QUESTIONS THE GO SO IF YOU'RE AFTER I AND I'D SIT AND INDIFFERENCE THE CHAIR TERMS OF HIS QUESTIONS I DO WANT TO JUST A- LET THE- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO AND THE BUDGET. KNOW THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE DOZENS OF SAFETY WAIVERS AND SAFETY. BUT WE OPENING PLANS. THERE GONNA BE SUBMITTED. AND THAT IS ALLOWS. TO RE. AS SOON AS- AND IF WAIVERS ARE NOT APPROVE. THEN WE NOW. ARE IN JEOPARDY OF DELAYING THE WOOD SCHOOL RE OPENINGS- POSSIBLY. EVEN MORE AND SO. THIS MAY NOT BE IT'S A- SEPARATE FROM THIS DISCUSSION BUT IT'S RELATED BECAUSE IF THOSE WAIVERS ARE REJECTED. IN SOME FORM OR FASHION- THEN WE NOW HAVE CREATED A PROCESS THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO RE OPEN AND THAT IS. CERTAINLY MY CONCERN- SPEAKING FOR A LOT OF THE RURAL COMMUNITIES SO THANK YOU AGAIN. AND I APPRECIATE MR JOBS ARE BACK OVER TO YOU. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR I WAS JUST TO GO BACK TO ALL- DISK. ON SB EIGHT SAID- JUST GO TO GO BACK TO HIS HOME AND ASK QUESTIONS REGARDING ARE. YOU INTIMATED ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL- AND ON MARCH- THE DEADLINE SO IF YOU JUST. I WHICH WHICH TO ME- THANK UP WITH MADRE REGIONAL LET'S JUST OF AB TEN. WELL BUT IF YOU COULD JUST KIND OF GO THROUGH WHAT THE MARCH FIFTEENTH DEADLINE WAS. YES THE HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I BELIEVE ARE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE'VE UPDATED OUR PROPOSAL THAT WE PROVIDED PUBLICLY. AND THAT HAD THAT FEBRUARY LANGUAGE IN FEBRUARY DATE CERTAINLY WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE LEGISLATURE- AND YOU RECOGNIZE THAT. AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE ALMOST ALL THE WAY THROUGH FEBRUARY AT THI POINT- THAT THAT WOULD DEFINITELY PUSH THAT DATE BACK BUT- YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE. FILTER PROPOSAL- POSTED BY AT THIS TIME. OKAY BECAUSE YOU WERE GUESS YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT- ARE. ALSO THAT THIS POINT THIS IS THE ONLY THING YOU'RE COMMENTING ON IS YOUR YOUR PUBLIC PROPOSAL- I BELIEVE THE END OF DECEMBER IS THAT CORRECT. YES OKAY VERY GOOD I THOUGHT OF I DECIDED THAT I WON'T GO FURTHER. REFERS INTO THAT. I WOULD JUST URGE KNOW WHAT WHAT I JUST. AND THEN JUST TO GO INTO- YOU KNOW FINISHING UP AND JUST WRAPPING UP I JUST I JUST WANNA THANK EVERYBODY FOR THE VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION. ON WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. HAVING NOW BEEN WORKING ON THIS OPENING SCHOOLS ISSUE SINCE. NOVEMBER I THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT IRONIC WHEN I HAVE DISTRICTS. ASKING FOR FLEXIBILITY I CAN THINK OF NO MORE REGULATED- SUBJECT MATTER THAN THE EDUCATION FIELD. DOWN TO THE HOUR IS DOWN TO THE CURRICULA AND DOWN TO THE COURSES DOWN TO THE GRAZED DOWN TO THE AGES. FRANKLY DOWN TO THE ATTENDANCE AGAIN JUST REMINDER ATTENDANCE IN SCHOOL IS NOT FLEXIBLE- THERE'S ALMOST NOTHING THAT IS FLEXIBLE. IN EDUCATION- WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST WAS MOVE TOWARD OUR LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. IN AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE DISTRICTS ARE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN TO A LARGE EXTENT IT HAS WORKED. VOCAL FLEXIBILITY. IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT LOCAL ISTRICTS. COULD ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT TO THEIR STUDENTS OVERALL I BELIEVE WAS THE RIGHT DECISION. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT. IN A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC THAT HAS TOUCHED EVERY SINGLE CORNER OF THE STATE- NOT EQUALLY BUT AS DEFTLY TOUCHED EVERY SINGLE CORNER OF THE STATE. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR OVER A THOUSAND DISTRICTS TO COME UP WITH A THOUSAND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS. AND WHAT WE HAD HOPED IS WHEN WE DID THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. IS BY REALLY REALLY FORCEFULLY ENCOURAGING EVERYBODY TO BE. MOVING TO IN PERSON LEARNING WHAT IT WAS POSSIBLE- AND AS WE SAW CASE RATES REALLY DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FALL AND SCHOOLS STARTED. WE UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T SEE DISTRICTS REALLY PREPARE FOR OPENING UP SCHOOLS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST TIME. OF MY COUNTY HAD ONE OF THE LOWEST CASE RATES IN THE STATE WE ACTUALLY REACHED. THE- SORT OF ON IT DOUBLE YELLOW TIER HOWEVER. NOTE AROUND SCHOOL REAL. NO DISCUSS AROUND HOW TO GET Q. BACK THOUGH WE HIT YELLOW FOR. SO I THINK WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT'S MISTAKE WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE GIVING MONEY TO DISTRICTS. TO ALLOW THEM THE CHOICE OF WHETHER TO OPEN UP OR NOT. THE MONEY IS TRUE IS FOR RE OPENING- AS YOU ALL SEE THE ONE THING WE'VE ALL AGREED ON IS WE WANT SCHOOLS TO RE OPEN UP THERE'S BEEN NO DISAGREEMENT. AROUND THAT IN THIS BODY TODAY REALLY IS ABOUT HOW WE DO IT AND HOW WE SUPPORT SCHOOLS IN DOING IT- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE GET SCHOOLS OPEN UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY LETTING DISTRICTS DO IT ON THEIR OWN IN THEIR OWN TIME FRAME HAS NOT WORKED. IT HASN'T WORKED IN THE MOST SMALLER DISTRICTS IT HASN'T WORKED IN OUR LARGEST DISTRICTS. SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE- MORE CENTRALIZED GUIDANCE WE DO APPRECIATE. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THEIR GUIDELINES IN TERMS OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A SAFE RE OPENING THE FROM OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. I THINK IT IS TIME FOR. THE LEGISLATURE OR GOVERNOR TO COME UP WITH OUR OWN GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE BELIEVE THE DISTRICTS- SHOULD BE DOING. IN ORDER TO SPEED THIS PROCESS OF RE OPENING ALONG. SO WITH THAT I APPRECIATE ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR COMMENTS THEIR FEEDBACK- WE EAGERLY WILL CONTINUE THIS. DISCUSSION. IN AGAIN- YOU KNOW I. WANTED RE ITERATE HOW AND- HAPPY ARE PROUD OF THE WORK WE HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF THIS. STIMULUS PURPLE. HAS SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL THE LEGISLATURE UNVEILED A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR ECONOMIC STIMULUS PROPOSAL. MANY OF THOSE IDEAS IN TERMS OF A SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS. MONEY FOR THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE FEE REDUCTION ARE CONTAINED IN THIS ALMOST. OVER NINE BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THAT AND HOPING THAT- CALIFORNIANS SEE THAT WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO TRY TO HELP THEM OUT IN THEIR TIME OF NEED IT WITH THAT- WE WILL ADJOURN THANK YOU.
