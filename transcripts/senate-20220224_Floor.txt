AND TOMATO TIMES BY THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. THE GENESIS A BLOCKAGE YOU MOUTH BEGAN IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN. I HAVE HALF A CENTURY AFTER THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT ABOLISHED SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT SET TO SEPTEMBER HARVARD TRAINED HISTORIAN CARTER G. WOODSON. AND A PROMINENT MISTER MINISTER JESSE E. MORELAND FOUNDED TO ASSOCIATION OF STUDY OF NEGRO LIFE AND HISTORY. AN ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO RESEARCHING AND PROMOTING ACHIEVEMENTS OF BLACK AMERICANS AND OTHER PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT. KNOWN TODAY AS ASSOCIATION STUDY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN LIFE AND HISTORY THE GROUP SPONSORED A NATIONAL. NEGRO HISTORY WEEK IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX CHOOSING THE SECOND WEEK OF FEBRUARY TO COINCIDE WITH THE BIRTHDAYS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS TWO OF HIS HEROES MANY PEOPLE SAID THAT FEBRUARY WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE IT WAS THE SHORTEST MONTH IN THE- YEAR. AND WANT TO SHOW DISRESPECT AFRICAN AMERICANS WITHOUT WAS THE FARTHEST THING FROM THE TRUTH. THE EVENT INSPIRED SCHOOLS IN COMMUNITIES NATIONWIDE TO ORGANIZE LOCAL CELEBRATIONS AND ESTABLISH HISTORY CLUBS. AND HOLDS PERFORMANCES AND LECTURES. IN THE DECADES THAT FOLLOWED CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY BEGAN ISSUING PROCLAMATIONS RECOGNIZING NEGRO HISTORY WEEK. BY THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES THANKS IN PART TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND GROWING AWARENESS OF BLACK IDENTITY NEGRO HISTORY WEEK HEADED BALL TO BLACK HISTORY MONTH. IN IT GERALD FORD OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED BLACK HISTORY MONTH IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX CALLING UPON THE PUBLIC TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HONOR- DOT TWO OFTEN NEGLECTED ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF BLACK AMERICANS. IN EVERY AREA RAYMOND DEVER THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY OUR CONTRIBUTIONS IN NOT JUST SLAVERY IS NOT JUST FIGHTING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IS NOT EVEN SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT. BUT PEOPLE OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE HISTORY IN THE FACE OF BRUTALITY. INJUSTICE SINCE OUR ARRIVAL TO THIS COUNTRY YET WE CONTINUE TO SERVE AND CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY AT ALL LEVELS. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS TIME TO SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHT AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE CONCEPT CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO BE FELT IN THIS STATEAND COUNTRY FAR BEFORE HIS OWN RIGHTS AS AN AMERICAN WAS FULLY RECOGNIZE. THAT'S IN THE PERSON OF FORMER SOME WOMEN. WILLIAM BYRON RUMFORD. I REMEMBER WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN ELECTED TO PUBLIC OFFICE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND A MEMBER OF THIS BLACK CAUCUS BAYERN RUN FOR WAS BORN IN NINETEEN OH EIGHT IN CORTLAND ARIZONA A GRADUATE OF UC SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL OF PHARMACY AND A CERTIFIED PHARMACISTS ROCKFORD ALSO EARNED A BA IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND A MA IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BOTH. AT UC BERKELEY. DUE TO HIS WEALTH OF EDUCATION EXPERIENCE AND POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT IN HIS COMMUNITY PROFFER WAS ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT AND BECAME EFFECTIVE LEGISLATOR ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. HE CREATED LEGISLATION TO CURB. JOB DISCRIMINATION. IN SCHOOLS ANY RACIAL BIAS IN THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD. AS WELL AS A LAW THAT MADE IT ILLEGAL FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES TO REFUSE TO COVER BLACK MOTORISTS. MOST NOTABLY MR TRUMP THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES ACT IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE THAT OUTLAWED DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT WHICH LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE COMMISSION HE ALSO AUTHORED AND CHAMPIONED THE RUMFORD FAIR HOUSING ACT SIGNED BY GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR EDMUND G. BROWN SENIOR IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THAT OUTLAWED DISCRIMINATION IN HOUSING IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THAT WAS UPHELD BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. WHEN IT RULED THAT PROPOSITION FOURTEEN A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO INVALID INVALIDATE THE ACT AND PREVENT HOUSING DISCRIMINATION WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL A YEAR LATER U. S. IS SPRING COURT STRAIGHTEN THIS RULING STATING THAT PROPOSITION FOURTEEN VIOLATED THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX WHICH PROHIBITS ALL RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE SALE OR RENTAL OF PROPERTY. THE SACRIFICE AND FIGHT A BARN ROUGHLY. WAS WILLING TO HELP ON BEHALF OF BLACK CALIFORNIA'S LED THE WAY FOR THE U. S. CONGRESS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT DO NOT THE NATIONAL HOUSING ACT WHICH SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS. HOUSING DISCRIMINATION BY RACE COLOR CREED NATIONAL ORIGIN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES IS RICH WITH THEM. IN PERSON INSPIRATIONAL STORIES OF NOBLE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE BYRON RUMFORD. WHOSE ACTIONS WORDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS AND PROSPERITY OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE STATE. THAT WE SO OFTEN ENJOYED TODAY BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO REMEMBER THOSE WHO ARE IN CONTINUED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TODAY. WE ALL IN THIS COUNTRY BENEFIT FROM THE RESILIENCE AND SACRIFICE MADE BY COMMUNITY WHOSE WHOSE HISTORICALLY ARE MARGINALIZED AND HAVE LACKED ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION. THAT IS ALL CONTINUE TO OCCUR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE NO BLACK HISTORY. THE HONOR HISTORY. BY CONTINUING THE WORK OF BYRON RUMFORD IN IMAGES AND THEIR ALLIES AND LET'S NOT BE FOOLED BY THIS CRITICAL RACE THEORY. BLACK HISTORY IS AMERICAN HISTORY. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES. FOR THEIR COMMENTS THAT WILL COME TODAY AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I'LL VOTE ON S. C. R. SIXTY SEVEN. SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- SENATORS I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. C. R. SIXTY SEVEN AND I'M EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. S. CHAIR OF THE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT OF S. C. R. SIXTY SEVEN WHICH RECOGNIZES FEBRUARY IS BLACK HISTORY MONTH. ONE MONTH IS CERTAINLY IN NOT ENOUGH TO FULLY CELEBRATE BLACK HISTORY AND THE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS BLACK AMERICANS HAVE MADE THAT SET THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR NATION. AND AS MY GOOD FRIEND SAID BLACK HISTORY IS AMERICAN HISTORY. AND CERTAINLY EFFORTS TO HIDE THIS HISTORY. OR PREVENT THE TEACHING OF THIS HISTORY TO OUR CHILDREN DIMINISHES OUR COUNTRY. AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN AND CELEBRATE BLACK HISTORY MONTH ONE THING THAT ALWAYS STANDS OUT IS THAT THE BLACK AMERICANS COMMITTEE'S ABILITY TO INSPIRE AND COLLABORATE AND LEAD. SHOULD BE AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL. ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT OFTEN TALKED ABOUT THE- BLACK COMMUNITIES AND ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN TELLING WORK TOGETHER TO COMBAT HATE AND RACISM. AS MARTIN LUTHER KING MARCHED FROM SELMA TO MONTGOMERY ASIAN AMERICANS MARCHED WITH HIM. AND ONE VINCENT CHEN WAS BRUTALLY BRUTALLY TARGETED AND MURDERED SIMPLY FOR BEING ASIAN ALONGSIDE THE API COMMUNITY AND USE THEIR VOICES TO HELP ELEVATE OURS. THE NINETEEN SIXTIES DURING THE HEART OF THE CIVIL RIGHTSMOVEMENT A COLLECTIVE OF BLACK LATINO NATIVE AMERICAN AND ATI COMMITTEES FOUGHT VIGOROUSLY FOR WHAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME. ETHNIC STUDIES. AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT THE BLACK AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE WOULD NOT BE WHERE WE ARE. HERE TODAY. BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CELEBRATE. INSPIRATIONAL BLACK LEADERS AND TO ALSO REFLECT ON THE STRUGGLES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS. OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS BLACK AMERICANS ARE THE BEDROCK OF AMERICAN HISTORY AND ARTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS LEGACY. THE FIGHT FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUALITY ARE CERTAINLY FAR FROM OVER. AND WE SHOULD LOOK TO. BLACK LEADERS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH POLICIES THAT WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY AS A WHOLE AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WE ALL. FELT STRONGLY SUPPORT THE C. R. SIXTY SEVEN THANK YOU. SENATOR DRAWS A. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AS CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS IT IS MY HONOR TO RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HIS C. R. SIXTY SEVEN BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS AN IMPORTANT TIME FOR US TO CELEBRATE NOT THE ONLY TIME BUT AN IMPORTANT TIME TO CELEBRATE BLACK EXCELLENCE TO REFLECT ON THE EXTRAORDINARY TALENTS ACHIEVEMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS TO OUR NATION. INDEED GENERATIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS THROUGH WORDS SACRIFICE AND ACTIONS HAVE MADE IMMEASURABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SUCCESS AND THE PROSPERITY OF OUR STATE AND OUR NATION THE STRUGGLES OF AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE BENEFITED AND INFLUENCED THE LATINO COMMUNITY. FOR INSTANCE THURGOOD MARSHALL'S LEGAL WORK LEADING UP TO AND INCLUDING HIS TIME ON THE SUPREME COURT ESTABLISH CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS THAT CONTINUE TO EMPOWER ALL MINORITIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. WELL HE MAY BE BEST REMEMBERED FOR ARGUING AGAINST THE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL DOCTRINE AND THE BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION CASE HE LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR COUNTLESS LEGAL ADVANCEMENTS THERE WOULD OCCUR OVER THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS. ADDITIONALLY THE VITAL WORK PERFORMED BY DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING AND HIS COMMITMENT TO NONVIOLENCE INSPIRED MANY FUTURE POLITICAL ACTIVISTS TO SEEK SOCIAL CHANGE. AMONG THOSE INFLUENCED BY DR KING AND THE MOVEMENT WAS A YOUNG SAYS R. CHAVEZ WOULD ALSO. ACHIEVE SUCCESS FOR FARM WORKERS AND ALL PEOPLE THROUGH NON VIOLENT MEANS. THE LATINO COMMUNITY IS GRATEFUL FOR SUCH LEADERSHIP INSPIRATION AND SUPPORT. IN TWO THOUSAND THREE I WAS PRIVILEGED TO BE THE NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF THE IMMIGRANT WORKERS FREEDOM RIDE ALONGSIDE REUBEN JAMES LAWSON AND CONGRESSMAN LEWIS AS CO CHAIRS. THIS WAS MODELED ON THE NET THIS NATIONAL MOBILIZATION WAS A PATH OF DEMAND IN THE SUPPORT. A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR ELEVEN MILLION UNDOCUMENTED OBVIOUSLY WAS MODELED ON THE FREEDOM RIDES OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. SO I'LL BE HALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I EXTEND OUR APPRECIATION TO THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS FOR ITS LEADERSHIP IN THIS GREAT STATE THANK YOU. SENATOR EDMUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LGBT CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF S. C. R. SIXTY SEVEN TODAY WE HONOR THE LIVES AND CONTRIBUTIONS AND VOICES OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN OUR NATION'S PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE BLACK LIVES MANY OF WHOM FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHTS WE HAVE TODAY. THE BLACK COMEDIANS LEADERS HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR COUNTRY WE UNDERSTAND THAT BLACK ACTIVISM AS SO OFTEN BEEN BORNE OUT OF NECESSITY SO THAT BLACK PEOPLE CAN LIVE AND THRIVE IN A NATION BUILT. BY THEIR ANCESTORS. WE SEEK TO HONOR BLACK LEADERS IS EXCELLENT AND DRIVE HAVE BENT THE ARC OF THE MORAL OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE TOWARDS JUSTICE FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE STONEWALL RIOTS LED BY MARSHA P. JOHNSON. TO THE PUSH FOR NATIONAL CIVIL AND VOTING RIGHTS WERE DESTROYED BY. BAYARD RUSTIN DO THE ARCHITECT OF THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT. CO FOUNDER ALICIA GARZA. TO BE IN THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST HIV AND AIDS BY PHIL WILSON. THESE ARE BUT A FEW EXCEPTIONAL BLACK FOLKS WILL ALSO. CONTINUE TO MAKE A LASTING POSITIVE. IMPRESSION IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. WE IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY- INTERNALLY GRATEFUL. TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY FOR HELPING US LEAD THE WAY FOR A BETTER TOMORROW. I ASK FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT OF S. C. R. SIXTY SEVEN. SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CHARACTERIZE- AS VICE CHAIR OF THE- JEWISH CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF A C. R. SIXTY SEVEN IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT- WE KNOW IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IT'S OUT WHEN YOU FORGET YOUR HISTORY WHEN PEOPLE FORGET YOUR HISTORY IT HAS A WAY OF REPEATING ITSELF AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS THAT- YOU GET KILLED YOUR COMMUNITY GETS KILLED AND ATTACKING GENOCIDE IS COMMITTED AGAINST YOU BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN. HISTORY AND EVERY YEAR WHEN WE COMMEMORATE AND CELEBRATE BLACK HISTORY MONTH- SO. SOMETIMES IT CAN FEEL PRO FORMA- AND SOMETIMES IT CAN FEEL FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS AND IT SHOULD NEVER FEEL THAT WAY BUT SOMETIMES IT DOES. THIS YEAR. I THINK WE ARE REMINDED ABOUT WHY BLACK HISTORY MONTH. IS SO IMPORTANT. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY. WHERE WE SEE SCHOOL BOARDS AROUND THE COUNTRY LITERALLY BANNING BOOKS TEACHING BLACK HISTORY. LITERALLY BANNING BOOKS TEACHING BLACK HISTORY BANNING BOOKS TO TEACH ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST. ANY BOOKS TO TEACH ABOUT THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY IN ONE STATE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT INCINERATING BOOKS. BURNING BOOKS WHERE WE SEEN THAT BEFORE AROUND THE COUNTRY LITERALLY BANNING THE TEACHING OF BLACK HISTORY I'LL SAY THAT AGAIN LITERALLY BANNING THE TEACHING. OF BLACK HISTORY. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IF WE DON'T LEARN AS ADULTS AND CHILDREN ABOUT OUR PAST AND NOT JUST A WHITEWASHED PASS OF THE WHITE UNITED STATES. OF ALL AMERICANS IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE HISTORY. OF OUR BLACK COMMUNITY OF BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO TEACH AND LEARN ABOUT THAT IT GETS FORGOTTEN AND THEN IT GETS REPEATED. SO BLACK HISTORY MONTH THIS MONTH THIS YEAR TAKES ON EVEN ADDITIONAL IMPORTANCE. AS WE FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HISTORY IS TAUGHT AND KNOWN AND ACKNOWLEDGED THANK YOU. SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I RISE. IN SUPPORT OF S. U. R. SIXTY SEVEN IS THE CHAIR OF MILITARY VETERANS COMMITTEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I AM SO HONORED TO SHARE WITH YOU. THE HISTORY. OF THE MILITARY WE CALLED OBVIOUSLY IT'S BLACK HISTORY MONTH BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT MILITARY HISTORY WHEN IT COMES TO AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THEIR SUPPORT OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY. FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR ALL THE WAY TO THE CIVIL WAR- WE THINK OF WORLD WAR TWO AND- THE BATTLES THAT TOOK PLACE AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE THERE SURE IN OUR COUNTRY. SEGREGATED YES BUT THEY WERE THERE IN SPITE OF IT THE VOLUNTEER. FROM CITY TO CITY. AND THEN OF COURSE FINALLY IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT WE'RE ABLE TO JOIN EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND WE BECAME TRULY ONE NATION ONE RACE. ONE AMERICA. IT BUT IT'S NOT OVER THE WORK IS STILL TO BE DONE. BUT I'M SO PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE MILITARY. I LOOK BACK IN I THINK OF ONE INDIVIDUAL SERGEANT CARTER. WHO WAS A TANK COMMANDER MORE WORK TO RECEIVE THE MEDAL OF HONOR. AND HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE. IN THE CIVIL WAR AFRICAN AMERICANS RECEIVED AMERICA'S HIGHEST MEDAL THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR THEY HAVE TRULY DENNIS HONOR. I MYSELF PERSONALLY IN MY OWN FIRST FIREFIGHT TO THE RIGHT OF ME TO THE LEFT OF ME WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN BROTHERS IN THE WITH THE EIGHTY SECOND AIRBORNE. BROWN BROTHERS PROPER TROOPERS SO I LOOK BACK AT WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED. JUST RECENTLY LAST COUPLE THREE YEARS AGO WE HAD THE LARGEST CLASS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WHO GRADUATED FROM WEST POINT THE LARGEST CLASS EVER IN HISTORY. SO IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW DIVERSITY YOU WANT TO FOLLOW INCLUSION FOLLOW OUR MILITARY AND ONE DAY MAYBE WE WILL ALL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO I STAND TALL WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES TO SAY THANK YOUFOR STANDING UP. AND ALWAYS REMINDING US WHAT BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS ALL ABOUT. AND I TRULY SUPPORT YES YOU ARE SIXTY SEVEN THANK YOU. SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBER I STAND AS VICE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. U. R. SIXTY SEVEN I THINK ARE CALLING FROM GARDENA FOR BRINGING IT BEFORE US. I'MIN READING ABOUT. THE HISTORY OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH. AND ARE PROBABLY GAVE US VERY. GOOD AND ACCURATE- HOW IT STARTED. AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH FEBRUARY WAS CHOSEN VERY SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS THE BIRTH. DATES OF BOTH- LINCOLN AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS SO. THOSE WERE ALREADY TWO BIRTHDAYS THAT. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY CELEBRATED IN THAT OBVIOUSLY WE TAKE NOTICE OF SO IF VERY GOOD MONTH BUT- IT DIGITALLY. IT TURNS OUT THAT EACH YEAR. BLACK HISTORY MONTH CHOOSES THE THEME AND THIS YEAR IT IS BLACK HEALTH AND WELLNESS. AND IT'S A VERY APT THEME BECAUSE- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S STILL NOT STILL BUT JUST ARE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN HEALTH. JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE BLACK THE WEATHER IN CALIFORNIA OR AMERICA THAT YOUR HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE LOWER. AND IF WE JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PANDEMIC OUR- RESIDENTS OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY WERE HIT FAR HARDER IN TERMS OF MORTALITY THAN- THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. AND THERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE THESE DISPARITIES AND FIGHT THROUGH BUDGETARY AND OTHER ACTIONS BEGIN TO ADDRESS THEM SO LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE WE INCREASED FUNDING. TO LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE FACT THAT BLACK BIRTHING PEOPLE IN BABIES HAVE FAR HIGHER MORTALITY RATES THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE EDUCATION OR THE INCOME LEVEL OR THAT THE HOSPITAL THAT THEY'RE BIRTHING OUTCOMES AND FOR BOTH THE- BIRTHING PERSON AND THE INFANT. MORE LIKELY LEADS TO DEATH. THAT IS NOT RIGHT NOT AT THE POINT WHERE WE ARE IN IN THIS- YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH THE TYPE OF MEDICAL ADVANCEMENTS THAT WE HAVE AND SO WE BOTH FIND IT MORE SPECIFIC CARE FOR BIKE PARKING PEOPLE AND RESEARCH ON WHY. SO THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS- GLADLY STANDS IN SUPPORT OF S. U. R. SIXTY SEVEN AND THANK YOU FOR BRING IT BEFORE US DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS RESOLUTION. SEEING NONE SENATOR BRADFORD YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS WHO SPOKE ON THIS ISSUE AND THEIR PERSPECTIVE AS TO THE IMPACT. OF AFRICAN AMERICAN CONTRIBUTIONS NOT ONLY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS NATION IN THE WORLD AND I CAN TOUCH UPON ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WAS STATED SPECIALLY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO WHO SPOKE TO THE ALLIANCE OF. AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IF WE KNOW OUR HISTORY IN GERMANY AND THEY WERE. FLEEING THEIR SCHOLARS EDUCATORS WHEN THEY CAME TO AMERICA. IT WASN'T HARVARD THAT WELCOME THEM IT WAS A YALE WHO WAS IN COLOMBIA. IT WAS IN U. S. C. H. B. C. USE THAT'S WHERE THEY FOUND EMPLOYMENT. THAT'S WHERE THE EDUCATED AFRICAN AMERICANS THAT'S WHERE THEY FOUND. THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THEIR CRAFT. AND AGAIN AS I SHARED LAST YEAR WE TALK ABOUT WESTERNS AND WE TALK ABOUT COWBOYS. IT WAS IN THE WHITE GUYS WHO WERE THE HEROES AND BROKE CATTLE IT WAS THE BLACK COWBOYS. IT WAS BASS REEVES IT WAS BILL PICKETT. IT WAS NATE LOVE THOSE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON THE FRONTLINES RISKING THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY TO MOVE CATTLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY TO. BREAK COURSES TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS SO WE CAN HAVE FARMING RANCHING AND AGRICULTURE. IN THIS COUNTRY AND AGAIN THE NAME COWBOY WAS A DEROGATORY REFERENCE TO BLOCK FARMHANDS BECAUSE WHITES WERE REFERRED TO. AS AND- BLACKS REFERRED TO AS COWBOYS. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. AGAIN THE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE'VE ALL GONE THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AND WE'VE ALL WENT BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THE VACCINATION. PLEASE NOTE. THAT IT WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN. WELL WHO HAS BEEN. ON THIS FAX FOR OVER FIVE YEARS. WE CONTRIBUTE TO EVERY ASPECT OF SOCIETY. AND WE CONTINUE TO DO IT DESPITE CONTINUED HARASSMENT RACISM AND EVERYTHING AND THIS YEAR AGAIN WE'RE PROVIDING A BOOK. TAKE A LESSON ON BLACK ACHIEVERS AND HOW THEY MADE IT AND WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY. AS ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES STATED IN SOME SCHOOLS YOU CAN HAVE THIS BOOK. BECAUSE THE CRITICAL RACE THEORY WE NEED TO QUIT WHITEWASHING HISTORY COLLEAGUES AND WE NEED TO STAND FIRM AND TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS. I'M NOT ONLY AFRICAN AMERICANS BUT ALL PEOPLE MY COLLEAGUE. BOB JUROR VETERAN AFFAIRS MENTIONED THE CONTRIBUTIONS AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE MADE. SINCE THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. BUT THE HELL FIGHTERS WHO WERE FRONTLINE. MILITARY MEN WHO WERE DISCRIMINATED HERE AT HOME BUT WENT AND PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO MAKE SURE WE CAN ENJOY THE FREEDOMS THAT WE HAVE TODAY AND I'LL JUST GIVE ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF WE ALL HEARD THE STORY. OF A MILLION AIRPARK THE AMAZING WOMAN PILOT BUT HOW MANY KNOWS THE STORY OF BESSIE COLEMAN. I'M PRETTY SURE AND NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE STORY BESSIE COLEMAN. THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO FLY. SHE FLEW. IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE. BUT WEREN'T HISTORY BOOK TO TALK ABOUT HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS. BUT SHE WAS A- MARVELOUS PILOT. WELL ACCOMPLISHED. A SKILLED PILOT YOU COULD EVER. HOPE TO BE IN A PLAN WITHIN THAT TIME IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE VERY LITTLE IS TALKED ABOUT. HER CONTRIBUTIONS. AND AS ALL OF YOU KNOW. I'M NOT A GOLFER. AND. ANY TIME YOU TEE UP A BALL ON A GOLF COURSE PLEASE NOTE THAT WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN AT THE GOLF T. AND WHEN YOU GET IN AN ELEVATOR TODAY. I BELIEVE THIS BUILDING PLEASE KNOW THAT IT WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO INVENTED TO ELEVATOR AND AS DR KING STATED OUR LIVES ARE IMPACTED NUMEROUS TIMES FROM THE TIME WE GET UP TO THE TIME WE GO TO BED BY THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS SO. ON THAT NOTE MEMBERS I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE ON A C. R. SIXTY SEVEN BECAUSE I CAN BE HERE UNTIL THE COWS COME HOME TALKING ABOUT ALL THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE MADE TO THIS COUNTRY THAT. MANY OF US DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SO I. SHE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY THIS MONTH BUT EVERY DAY TO LEARN THE CONTRIBUTIONS I RESPECT S. ARRIVAL THANK YOU. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN EYE ARCHULETA HI ADKINS I BASE FIVE BECKER HI FORGES. BY BRADFORD I KERR BY ADAM I PROTESTING HI DARLING.

I THIRTY SEVEN NO ZERO THE RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED MEMBERS RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA SEE A SHORT VIDEO THAT'S BEEN PREPARED SPECIALLY FOR TODAY. OWNING A HOME IN CALIFORNIA IS JUST AS ELUSIVE TODAY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AS IT WAS IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE. IN SAN DIEGO ONLY 29% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS OWN THEIR OWNHOMES COMPARED TO MORE THAN 61% OF WHITES IN THAT CITY. AND THE GAFFER SIMILAR IN MOST REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA AND YET OWNING A HOME IS MORE THAN AN AMERICAN DREAM LIKE FOOD AND CLOTHING SHELTER IS INTENSITY THAT TOO MANY OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS SIMPLY DO NOT POSSESS. FOLLOWING WORLD WAR TWO THERE WAS A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. FIRST THEY LIVED IN PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT THERE ARE MANY NEIGHBORHOOD DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BLACKS IN CALIFORNIA. I WROTE FOR SUBURBAN. IN THE MID FORTIES AFTER WORLD WAR TWO. ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH. NOT ONLY A POLITICAL FIGURE BUT ALSO A BUSINESSMAN AND SOMEONE WAS INVOLVED IN NEIGHBORHOOD OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS BUT FRANKLY JUST A REALLY NICE PERSON. BUT I WAS REALLY DO THAT PIONEER WHO MADE EFFORT. BRING THE ICE AND POLITICS CAL BECAME THE FIRST BLACK MEMBER TO LEAD FROM NORTH CALIFORNIA. IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSED A FAIR HOUSING ACT. AUTHORED BY THE HONORABLE BYRON RUMFORD. WHO REPRESENTED THE OAKLAND BERKELEY EAST BAY AREA OF CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATION AIMED TO ELIMINATE REDLINING DISCRIMINATION AND RACIST POLICIES PREVENTING AFRICAN AMERICANS AND OTHER RACIAL MINORITIES FROM PURCHASING HOMES. IN ROMFORD ACTIVE. WHICH GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN UP. THE ENTIRE LOS ANGELES. PERSON WHO COULD AFFORD TO LIVE WHERE EVER THEY COULD AND COULD ENJOY ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF MOVING WHERE THEY WANTED TO. WHERE YOU LIVE CAN HAVE TREMENDOUS IMPACT. ON YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND YOUR OPPORTUNITY BUT WE TAKE IT AWAY IT'S VERY PERSONAL. IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE PASSED AROUND FROM ACTING EVEN THOUGH- SOMEONE. SUCCESSFUL IT WAS A LOT OF OPPOSITION THEACT WAS EVENTUALLY OVERTURNED BY A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE THAT GROUP CALIFORNIA STILL WASN'T PREPARED ALL OF THE CITIZENS IN THE AMERICAN DREAM. MOST REMARKABLE ABOUT BY ROAD FROM WHICH WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS AGAINST THE ODDS BUT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NOT AN OVERWHELMING. DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN BASE FOR ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS IS INDICATIVE OF POLITICAL HEARD THAT NATURE EXIST IN MODERN SOCIETY. IN APRIL OF NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON SIGNED THE FAIR HOUSING ACT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE U. S. HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THE ACCESS HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. IS ILLEGAL IN NEARLY ALL HOUSING. WE HAD LEAD REALLY NEED TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT THE WAYS THAT WE CAN ENABLE THE BLACK COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE TO BUILD CREDIT. ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO OWN THEIR OWN HOMES WE KNOW THAT EVEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RACISM. HAS KEPT THE BLACK COMMUNITY FROM BEING ABLE TO OWN OUR OWN HOMES. WE KNOW THAT'S COME IN THE FORM OF REDLINING IT'S COME IN THE FORM OF COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS THAT HAVE CAUSED US NOT TO BE ABLE TO EVEN LIVE OR- BUY HOMES IN PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES. AND WE STILL SEE THE LEGACY OF RED LINING. THE ROCKFORD ACT WAS IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY. BECAUSE AT THAT TIME YOU COULD BE DISCRIMINATED IN PUBLIC HOUSING. IN FACT IT COULD BE DISCRIMINATED IN MOST PUBLIC AND CIVIC INFRASTRUCTURES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. ROCKFORD'S CURRY. AND BRAVERY IN FIGHTING THE PAST ACT NINETEEN SIXTY THREE LAID THE FOUNDATION. FOR A WHOLE HOST OF SOCIAL CHANGE AND INCLUSION ACROSS OUR CIVIC AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. ACTS LIKE RUN PROJECT WE HAVE A MODEL FOR HOW WE CAN FIGHT BACK. AND HOW WE CAN USE POLICY AS A TOOL TO CHANGE THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE. FOR PEOPLE IN OUR STATE AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE FACING FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION. IN ORDER FOR MORE AFRICAN AMERICANS TO OWN HOMES WE NEED OUR BANKING INSTITUTIONS TO BE MORE. GENEROUS AND PEN AND THEIR PROCESSES OF PROVIDING LOANS TO AFRICAN AMERICANS WE'VE SEEN THROUGH THE- DATA THAT AFTER A MERICAN. HOME LOANS AT A RATE OF ALMOST 50% LESS. THAN OUR WHITE COUNTERPARTS SO IT'S CRITICAL THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE PHONES. EVEN THOUGH WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND REDLINING SOME OF THOSE PRACTICES SUCH AS FISH STILL EXISTS TODAY SO. WE HAVE TO DRESS UP AS WELL. I WITHIN MY- IT'S ALWAYS DONE. MOVING FORWARD AND AGREE OF GREATER. POWERFUL MESSAGE FROM THE BLACK CAUCUS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR- PRODUCING THAT IN BRINGING INFORMATION FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN BE EDUCATED ABOUT THINGS WE FORGOTTEN OR THAT WE SHOULD KNOW MUCH BETTER.

BORN IN NEW YORK CITY IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO MORRIS CAME TO SAN DIEGO IN THE SEVENTIES. CHARGED WITH THE TASK OF HELPING OUR COMMUNITY FIGHT ANTI SEMITISM BIGOTRY AND HATE. AN IMPORTANT BUT HEAVY ROLE THAT UNFORTUNATELY KEPT HIM BUSY UNTIL HIS RETIREMENT IN TWENTY TEN. AND PUT HIM AND HIS FAMILY AT RISK NUMEROUS TIMES OVER FOUR DECADES. DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS NOT A STRANGER TO A BULLET RESISTANT VEST. HE WAS ON THE RECEIVING END OF BOMB THREATS AND PAINTED SWASTIKAS AND HE WAS TARGETED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS. MORRIS DEVOTION TO HIS WORK NEVER WAVERED. HE WAS FUELED BY DREAM THAT HIS EFFORTS COULD MAKE A BETTER SAFER PLACE AND THEY DID. CERTAINLY FOR SAN DIEGO. AS THE FOUNDER AND REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF OUR LOCAL ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE MORRIS WAS A FIXTURE OF SAN DIEGO'S JEWISH COMMUNITY AND A GIANT IN THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE REGION. HE GUIDED SAN DIEGO IN THE AFTERMATH OF MULTIPLE ANTI SEMITIC ATTACKS HELP TO PROTECT OUR MUSLIM NEIGHBORS IN THE WAKE OF NINE ELEVEN. AND WORKED TIRELESSLY TO REDUCE THE ACTS OF HATE THAT HAVE TOO OFTEN MARRED OUR COMMUNITY. UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE CREATED A HATE CRIME REGISTRY. INTERFAITH WORKSHOPS AND TOLERANCE TRAININGS. OVER THE YEARS MORRIS WORK CLOSELY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. WAS ACTIVE ON COMMITTEES FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING ANTI SEMITISM. AND BECAME KNOWN AS THE PERSON TO GO TO WHEN BIGOTRY OF ANY SORT REARED ITS UGLY HEAD. HIS PASSION WAS ADMIRABLE HIS UNRELENTING OPTIMISM WAS INSPIRING. AND A SENSE OF HUMOR WAS ALWAYS SHARP. HIS LEGACY ONE DOOR IN THE REMARKABLE WORK THAT FOREVER CHANGED OUR COMMUNITY. HE IS SURVIVED BY HIS WIFE OF FIFTY YEARS DURING. HIS SONS LOREN AND SIMON HIS BROTHER STEVE HIS SISTER SUSAN AND ONE GRANDCHILD COLLEAGUES ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN RECOGNITION OF MARS CONCERT SO THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEMP PLEASE BRING HIS NAME TO THE DESK SO HE CAN BE APPROPRIATELY MEMORIALIZED BY THE SENATE.

ERIC IN LIFE AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT A ONE PARTICULAR AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO REALLY LEFT HER MARK ON OUR COMMUNITY IN OUR NATION AND WHOSE LIFE WAS CUT SHORT IN A BRUTAL MANNER. LIKE TO RISE IN IT TO TURN THE MEMORY OF MR MRS JACQUELINE. A LOT. JACKSON WAS VERY POORLY SHOT DURING. A HORRIFIC BOTCHED OME.
