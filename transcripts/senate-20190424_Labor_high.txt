YOUR TO GO THAT SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO THE SENATE THE LABOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT COMMITTEE. OF THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING FOR WEDNESDAY APRIL TWENTY FOURTH HEARING -- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ITEMS ON THE AGENDA WE DO HAVE A SPECIAL ORDER ITEM THAT WOULD BE ITEM NUMBER ONE SB TWO THIRTY EIGHT BY -- SENATOR GROWTH OF PLEASE COME FORWARD WE WILL BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE. AND INTO WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND THEN WE WILL. BE A FULL COMMITTEE SO PLEASE. AND WHAT I WILL ALSO BE DOING TODAY IS. TO LIMIT OUR TESTIMONY ON EACH SHOT SIDE TO SIX MINUTES. SO WE CAN DO SIX MINUTES ON THE SIDE AND THEN HAVE ME TO USE AFTER THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED IT'S OF THE AGENDA SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS MY OPENING STATEMENT WHICH SHALL BE READY. IF YOU CAN DO THAT SIX MINUTES ALL OF IT. M.. THESE SIGNATURES THAT WE GATHERED THAT. ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS BILL THIS MORNING. SB TWO THIRTY EIGHT IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART IN THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT WORK UNDER. AS THE THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE INTO THE SUPREME COURT ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED CRAP THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DYNAMICS DECISION. IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THE SUPREME COURT ISSUED A DECISION. IN A CASE THAT CHANGE THE WORK LIFE FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS DEPARTING FROM A THIRTY YEAR OLD BLOCK. THE DYNAMICS DECISION CREATED A NEW TEST TO DETERMINE WHO IS AND IS NOT A CONTRACTOR. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE AFFECTED BY THIS DECISION AND I THINK IT'S AN CAMPAIGN TEMP ON US IN THE LEGISLATURE TO COME UP WITH A FAIR AND EQUITABLE. A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT BENEFITS ALL EMPLOYEE IS AND NOT CREATE CARVE OUT. THERE'S DOCTORS INSURANCE AGENTS ENGINEERS SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. SINCE CONSULTANTS AND ARTISTS SUMMER HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY. IT'S THE COLLEGE STUDENT WHO WORKS AFTER CLASS TO AFFORD THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING THE HAIR STYLIST WHO SETS THEIR OWN APPOINTMENTS RENTS THEIR BOOTH THERE CHOOSES TO SET THEIR OWN WORK HOURS. NEARLY HALF OF ALL MILLENNIALS WE CALL A SIDEKICK -- ON THE GIG ECONOMY AND SEVENTY FIVE PER 79% OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FOR TO WORK IN THIS -- WORK ENVIRONMENT THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL EMPLOYMENT TEST IS NOT AND CANNOT APPLY TO CALIFORNIANS WHO DEPEND ON THIS TYPE OF IN C√ÉM. AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE WORK SPACE SO THE EMPLOYEES CAN DETERMINE WHAT TO DO WHEN THEIR OWN HOURS WERE WANTING TO BE SET. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPACT OF THE DECISION IT'S PROSPECTIVELY I AM ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GREAT CONCEPT. THE RETROACTIVE APPLICATION SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT EMPLOYERS FOLLOWED THE RULES THE WAY THE LAW WAS WRITTEN AND THEN THIS. THIS DECISION COMES INTO PLACE AND THEN NOW EMPLOYERS WE EFFECTIVE FOR FOUR YEARS PRIOR EVEN THEY WERE FALLING THE EXISTING LAW IN THE BEGINNING. THIS IS JUST A POT OF GOLD FOR LITIGATION ATTORNEYS THAT ARE GOING TO FILE LAWSUITS AGAINST EMPLOYERS FOR FOLLOWING THE LAW AS IT WAS IN IT WAS IN PLACE WHEN THEY WERE DOING IT. SB TWO THIRTY EIGHT WOULD MODEL CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR TESTS FOR FOR WAITING OUR ISSUES ON A MULTI FACTOR ECONOMIC REALITY TEST. AND IT'S ALREADY BEING USED BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SO WE PISSING CONSISTENT WITH -- FEDERAL LAW. AND CONFORMING BY THE FEDERAL RULES IN DETERMINING EMPLOYMENT STATUS SB TWO THIRTY EIGHT WOULD HAVE ADDED BENEFIT EASING COMPLIANCE FOR BUSINESSES THAT ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO COMPLY WITH DIFFERENT SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY RULES UNDER THE HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS -- TAKING AWAY THEIR FREEDOM AND FLEXIBILITY AND FORCING THEM BECOME EMPLOYEES IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S BENEFICIAL WHICH I THINK YOU'LL HEAR MOST IMPORTANTLY FROM THE WITNESSES. SO I'M GONNA STOP THERE AND INTRODUCED ME WITNESSES AND ALLOW THEM TO SPEAK I'LL START WITH THOMAS ME A MILLENNIAL. WHO IS GOING TO SHARE HIS? MORRELL IS GERMANY WITH ME MY NAME IS THOMAS MAY AS YOU ALREADY KNOW I'M TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD I WORK HERE IN SACRAMENTO IS A FINANCIAL PLANNER -- AND I REALLY ENJOY WHAT I DO I GET TO YOU KNOW WORK WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE EVERY DAY -- I GET TO EDUCAT PEOPLE AND AND ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS I'M WHERE I DECIDED TO BASE MY PRACTICE WAS. THE ABILITY TO NOT BE STUCK WITH ONE COMPANY -- IN THE STRUCTURE I HAVE NOW I AM ABLE TO WORK WITH MORE THAN FORTY OR FIFTY DIFFERENT COMPANIES WHERE THE HAS TO DO WITH LIFE INSURANCE ANNUITIES WEALTH MANAGEMENT -- ESTATE PLANNING IN MY FEE BASED BUSINESS THAT HAS TO DO WITH FINANCIAL PLANNING ITSELF. MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS THAT -- THIS WILL HELP -- YOU'RE PROTECTED THAT WAY IF I'M RESTRICTED FROM BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH MORE THAN FORTY DIFFERENT COMPANIES. I BECOME A CAPTIVE AGENT AND THE WAY THAT I WORK. I DON'T SEE THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO THE END USER SO PART OF THE VALUE THAT I BRING IS THAT I CAN. EVALUATE SOME A SITUATION AND THEN GO SHOPPING THE MARKET PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE BEST THING POSSIBLE SO -- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I'M ABLE TO DO THAT -- WITH ALL MY DIFFERENT CLIENTS AND KEEP THE FLEXIBILITY MY SCHEDULE I REALLY ENJOYED BEING ABLE TO NOT ONLY SET MY OWN HOURS -- BUT BE ABLE TO SEE CLIENTS LATE AT NIGHT JUST LAST WEEK I HAD TO CLIENTS I SAW EIGHT AND NINE PM IN MY OFFICE IN SACRAMENTO AS AN HOURLY EMPLOYEE I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FLEX MY SCHEDULE. FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THE IT DOES THEMSELVES MARRIED COUPLES THAT WORK ON HOURS THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE IT BETWEEN EIGHT AND FIVE LIKE A NORMAL BANK WOULD OFFER TO YOU -- AND SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL -- THAT WE BE ABLE TO KIND OF PROTECT THAT WAY. BEYOND NOT BEING ABLE TO GROW MY BUSINESS -- YOU SOME OF THE RULES OF COME THAT MAKE IT REALLY UNCLEAR ON HOW. I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HIRE PERSONAL SYSTEM TO FUTURE OR SOMEONE THAT MIGHT SET APPOINTMENTS OR HELP BRING MEETINGS FOR ME IF I WANT TO BRING ON A JUNIOR -- SO THOSE THINGS ARE A VERY BIG CONCERN TO ME AS WELL AS SOMEBODY WHO'S MAYBE ONLY TWO YEARS INTO THEIR CAREER -- BUT WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE FOR ANOTHER THIRTY AND BE ABLE TO GROW IN. SOUTH THANK YOU MISTER MAY NICK MISTER WITNESS OF GOOD MORNING. MORNING. MY NAME IS NICK HILL I REPRESENT THE KERN COUNTY BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. WE ALL KNOW THAT BEING AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR ALLOWS YOU THE FREEDOM AND THE ABILITY TO DO -- A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT ONE THE MAIN POINTS THAT I'M SURE YOU'LL AGREE WITH. IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HIGH RATE OR CRY. AND A LOT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE RECORDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND SOME MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET. GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT THEY CAN GET A JOB. BUT THEY CAN'T GET A CAREER SO IF. YOU GUYS THESE PEOPLE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN START A BUSINESS OF THEIR ALL. BECOME INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR IT ALLOWS THEM ABILITY TO GET BACK ON THE RIGHT PATH. ALSO IT WOULD ALLOW THEM. TO GAIN -- MORE EQUIPMENT SO THEY CAN HIRE MORE PEOPLE UP AND USE MORE PEOPLE ON ON ON THESE. EVENTS THAT THEY DO AND ALSO -- THE TERROR THAT PIPELINE TO PRISON. YOU KNOW BECAUSE LIKE IF YOU. GIVE ALTERNATIVES -- TO HOW WOULD YOU SAY OFFENDERS EX OFFENDERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WELL IF ONCE YOU GIVE THEM THAT ALTERNATIVE YOU KNOW YOU'RE. ALLOWING THEM TO GO BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY AND SERVE AS A CITIZEN. AGAIN SO -- THE OTHER THING WOULD BE. 95% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN BUSINESSES ARE SO PROPRIETORS SO WITH THAT BEING SAID. THIS WILL BE A DETRIMENT TO THEM AS WELL IF THEY ARE SENATE BILL TWO THIRTY EIGHT DOES NOT PASS. AND AS FAR AS OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR CHAMBER AND EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT IF WE'RE THERE TO HELP THEM PROMOTE THEIR BUSINESS EXPAND YOUR BUSINESS AS YOU KNOW -- ENTREPRENEUR IS -- INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS -- THEN. THAT WOULD AFFECT US DEEPLY AS FAR AS WHAT WE CAN DO FOR OUR MEMBERS. AND IF. WE ARE HOW WOULD YOU SAY. IN THE BUSINESS OF HELPING PEOPLE. AND IF THIS BODY. IS IN THE BUSINESS OF HELPING PEOPLE. I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE A WAY WHERE YOU WOULD LAW. TO MAKE SURE THAT SB TWO THIRTY EIGHT PASSES BECAUSE IT JUST LIKE -- ANY OTHER BUSINESS. THAT YOU HAVE HERE IN IF YOU. NURTURE YOUR BUSINESS AND YOU ROW YOUR BUSINESS IN A LIKE WITH ME I'VE BEEN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS MYSELF. I HAVE A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD AND A NINETEEN YEAR OLD. I HAVE ENTERTAINMENT THIS IS THAT MEANS THAT. NOW THAT I'M OLDER THAT BUSINESS IS GOING DOWN TO THEM. YOU KNOW I STARTED A CONSULTING BUSINESS MYSELF SO THAT MEANT THAT NO MIGHT MIGHT I CAN CARRY ON MY BUSINESS MY LEGACY. WITH MY CHILDREN. AND SO THAT THAT MEANS THAT THEY ARE WILL HAVE A LEG UP SO TO SPEAK AS FAR AS BEING PRODUCTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL THANK YOU MISTER DEAL  JUST WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE TIME AND LOOK AT THE TRUTH IS THAT. GRADUATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I'LL BE BRIEF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SEAN LEWIS WITH THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS NFIB.

OF NFIB AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN GENERAL NOT ONLY WHO UTILIZE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN THEIR BUSINESS MODELS BUT MANY OF WHICH WHO ARE THEY THEMSELVES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WE ALL KNOW HOW WE GOT HERE ABOUT ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR AGO -- THE CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT UNDID DECADES OF PRESIDENT BY INVALIDATING A LONG STANDING MULTI FACTOR BOUNCING TEST TO DETERMINE WHETHER A WORKER WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS AN EMPLOYEE. VERSES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS ONE DECISION DYNAMAX -- THE SUPREME COURT LEGISLATIVE FROM THE BENCH WITH NO PUBLIC INPUT OR PROPER LEGISLATIVE DUE DILIGENCE AND REACH ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO MASSACHUSETTS TO ADOPT AN INCREDIBLY RIGID. ABC THREE FACTORS HAS WHICH IS SIMPLY ON WORKABLE OFFER SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS. AND THE KEY TO THIS TEST IS THAT THAT WERE WORKER MUST MEET ALL THREE A. B. AND C.. SENATE BILL TWO THIRTY EIGHT WOULD -- PROVIDE OF CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MULTI FACTOR BOUNCING TEST SIMILAR BAROLO BUT ACTUALLY MUCH MORE ROBUST SO TO BRIDGE MY COMMENTS I'LL BE BRIEF AND SAY THAT SENATE BILL TWO THIRTY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT OUR MEMBERS. BUT SMALL BUSINESSES IN GENERAL AND WE WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THANK YOU CENTER FOR INTRODUCING IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER LEWIS I APPRECIATE THE THE TESTIMONY AND OF FOR ALL OF YOU BEING HERE THIS MORNING OF NOTE THOSE IN -- THOSE OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME TO THE MIKE PHONE AND IF YOU COULD STATE YOUR NAME AND IF THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION OR AFFILIATION THAT YOU HAVE -- AND WHAT AND THAT YOU SUPPORT THE BILL WOULD APPRECIATED THANK YOU GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S ERIC BUYER OF A LOCAL ATTORNEY ON A LAW FIRM WE DO BUSINESS LAW AND I'M. DEFINITELY SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL TWO THIRTY EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING THE MORNING MY NAME IS JOHN GRZYMA CARICATURIST BY -- EDUCATOR FOR FIFTEEN YEARS IT SHOWS THIS PATHWAY TO BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BECAUSE IT GAVE ME TIME WITH MY THREE CHILDREN -- AND ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO OVER FOR MY TALENTS NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR MY FELLOW ARTISTS AND THE DEFINITIONS OF THE PROPOSAL IS SOMETHING I'M IN SUPPORT OF THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING THE MORNING MY NAME IS MAYBE HE I'M A RETIREE FROM THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR. AND I'M INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR SO HELP ME WITH SOME. SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME FOR THE FAMILY AND AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO THIRTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE. STATE YOUR NAME IN LIGHTS MY NAME IS MIKE TOUGH FINALE AND I AM AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR IN THE FIELD OF EVENT ENTERTAINMENT. BASICALLY I'M I'M A PARTY CARICATURE ARTIST AND I AM IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE S. P. -- TWO THIRTY EIGHT TO MAINTAIN MY STATUS AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANYONE. RIGHT THOSE WHO ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. WE NEED A THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. SO AS WE DID ON THE SUPPORT THE THE PRESENTATION. FOR LESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS I CAITLYN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION. I'M I WANT TO BEGIN WITH WHAT'S AT STAKE WHEN WORKERS GET MISCLASSIFIED WHEN YOUR CLASSIFIED AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR -- BUT YOU ARE PROPERLY AN EMPLOYEE WORKING FOR SOMEONE. YOU LOSE OUT ON VIRTUALLY EVERY LAW THAT THIS LEGISLATURE AN AXE TO PROTECT WORKERS. I WAS STRUCK BY THE COMMENTS ABOUT PEOPLE WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS ENACTED LAWS TO PROTECT PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS FROM EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION WITH AN ACTIVE LAW TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM. OTHER CREDIT REPORTS BEING USED TO DENY THEM EMPLOYMENT. LAWS TO REQUIRE WILL PAY MINIMUM WAGE WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY. ALL OF THOSE ARE LOST WHEN A WORKERS MISCLASSIFIED. THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS ISSUE SO IMPORTANT. FOR MANY DECADES THE LABOR MOVEMENT HAS FOUGHT THE PROBLEM OF MATH CLASSIFICATION WHERE WE SEE AN EROSION IN WORKERS RIGHTS. INTEGRATED STANDARDS. THE DYNAMICS DECISION WHICH WAS UNANIMOUS DECISION ISSUED LAST YEAR BY OUR STATE SUPREME COURT. IT OPTED A CLEAR SIMPLE OBJECTIVE STANDARD. I'M A BIT SURPRISED THAT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WOULD EMBRACE. A STANDARD. NOT THAT NOT THE EXISTING LAW PRIOR TO DYNAMAX THE BROTHER TEST -- BUT THE FEDERAL LAW WHICH IS. A SIMILARLY SUBJECTIVE COMPLICATED SO I LOOK ONLY AT THE THE FIRST ONE UP THERE THE NEEDS OF THE NATURE AND DEGREE OF CONTROL BY THE PRINCIPAL. THE AMOUNT OF WORKERS INVESTMENT IN FACILITIES THE EXTENT TO WHICH SERVICES RENDERED ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PRINCIPLES BUSINESS THOSE ARE COMPLEX. THE FACTORS THAT REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF ANALYSIS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE CLEAR SIMPLE TESTING DYNAMAX. WILL REDUCE LITIGATION WILL PROVIDE CLARITY FOR WORKERS AND THE PLAYERS ABOUT WHAT THE TRUE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP IS. AT THE SAME TIME WE RECOGNIZE. NOT EVERY WORKER IS APPROPRIATELY COVERED BY THE DYNAMICS TEST THAT IS WHY WE ARE SPONSORING A BILL. THAT IS A VEHICLE FOR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY I BELIEVE SOME OF THE WITNESSES THAT SPOKE MAY ACTUALLY BE EXEMPTED I'M NOT EVEN SURE THE EXTENT TO WHICH DYNAMICS WOULD APPLY. TO SOMEONE THAT OWNS THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND IS PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES BUT TO THE EXTENT IT WOULD I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY EXEMPTED UNDER AB. FIVE THE GOAL OF DYNAMICS IN THE GOAL OF OUR BILL IS NOT TO TAKE ANYONE OUT OF BEING IN BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES IT'S TO STOP IF CLASSIFICATION. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR CHARMERS RENEE BAYARDO AS HE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA I'M JUST HERE TO PROVIDE A A QUICK EXAMPLE IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY -- WE SEE THE USE OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WERE EMPLOYERS THAT ARE MEMBERS WORK FOR OR OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE ALL IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE BUSINESS FOR PEOPLE CONTRACTS CHANGED HANDS ALL THE TIME SO THERE'S A SUPER COMPETITION IN THAT INDUSTRY. AN EDITOR AT ALLEN ARE BUSINESSES THAT ARE USING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO LOWER THEIR COSTS TO NOT PAY PAYROLL TAXES AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED OF ALL OTHER EMPLOYERS. AND THESE ARE WORKERS WERE TRULY WORKING FOR SOMEONE ELSE ARE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OF THEIR SCHEDULE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THEIR WORK DYNAMICS AT ALL. OF THIS IS PURELY USED TO LOWER COSTS AND UNDER CUT -- GOOD BUSINESSES WHO ARE TRYING TO FOLLOW THE RULES ARM SO THAT'S WHAT DYNAMICS IS REALLY ABOUT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR BEING HERE WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS BEFORE WE GO TO THE OTHER OPPOSITION THERE IS ANY TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM THANK YOU SENATOR. JACK RUBY AND HERE'S WEALTH OF PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATORS HELP HERE WELL HERE MORRELL. MORRELL HERE JACKSON HERE JACKSON HERE MITCHELL.

KATHY CARMODY CALIFORNIA OUT TO COUNCIL OPPOSED THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. PERIOD JEAN NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IS SENATOR MORE. SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL I I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT. THAT THIS BILL WOULD CREATE -- THAT WOULD BE EXPLOITED BY BUSINESSES TO MISS CLASSIFY WORKERS. ABSOLUTELY AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IN MY MIND OR THE OPPOSITION'S MINE AND I AGREE WITH THEM THAT THERE ARE SOME BUSINESSES A VERY FEW. THAT DO EXPLOIT WORKERS BUT WE NEED -- TO WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND LABOR STANDARDS INFORMANTS FORSMAN THAT IS AN ENFORCEMENT ARM OF OUR LABOR CODE. OF OUR LABOR LAW AND THEY CAN GO AFTER THOSE BUSINESSES TO PUNISH AN ENTIRE GIG ECONOMY TO PUNISH. OVER TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT FIND THEIR WAY TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL INCOME -- FOR FORWARD FOR LACK OF AFFORDABILITY YOU KNOW TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT SUBSTITUTE THEIR INCOME LIKE THAT THE RETIREE WHO SPOKE. AT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO SPOKE ABOUT YOU KNOW THE ARTIST WHO TALKS ABOUT TAKING CARE OF HIS THREE CHILDREN WORKING ON ITS FROM BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN -- THEIR CHOICE OF EMPLOYMENT IS VERY DISTURBING -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OPPOSITION THAT CAME THROUGH ON THAT THE -- THE DYNAMICS DECISION AND IT SAID THE DYNAMICS -- BRINGS IT BRINGS MORE CLARITY -- I THINK THIS BILL BRINGS MORE CLARITY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DYNAMICS DECISION OUR BILLS ARE BILLS BASED ON FEDERAL LAW WHICH DOESN'T PARTISAN COMP CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL LAW. AND IT'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT NOT JUST DISTRICT AS THE DYNAMICS DECISION BUT NOT AS LIBERAL AS THE CARRILLO TASKS SO IT BRINGS THINGS BACK INTO PERSPECTIVE JUST ON AN ECONOMIC. PERSPECTIVE JUST LAST WEEK THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN THE PAPER FOR SHERMAN OAKS HAIR STYLIST THAT TALKED ABOUT. HOW SHE IS MARRIED SHE HAS A CHILDREN SHE VOLUNTEERS ARE CAN CANCER PATIENTS AND SHE STATED IN OUR ARTICLE THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE FORCED TO BE AN EMPLOYEE? AND SHE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE TO DO THAT WITH LIKE I SAID IN MY OPENING TESTIMONY WHEN YOU HAVE THE OUR STUDENTS THAT ARE HAS STRUGGLING WITH HOUSING IN THE AB WITH HOUSING WHEN THEY GO TO COLLEGE. THEY CAN DRIVE FOR TWO HOURS -- THROUGH TE GIG ECONOMY THROUGH UBER LEFT TO MAKE THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. SURE YOU CAN MAKE AN EMPLOYEES AND THEY CAN MAKE FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR BUT THEN WHAT DO YOU DO YOU TAKE INCOME AWAY FROM THEM. YOU RESTRICT THEIR HOURS SO -- I'M JUST TRYING TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO SUCCEED IT DOESN'T -- IT DOESN'T RESTRICT -- PEOPLE'S OPPORTUNITY -- IT THIS BILL -- NOT RESTRICT PEOPLE'S OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED AND BE IS ENTREPRENEURIAL AS THEY SO CHOOSE SET THEIR OWN HOURS AND I THINK PLACING EVERYBODY YOU KNOW IN A ONE PARTICULAR CLASS OF THAT OF AN ECONOMY. THAT REQUIRES EVERYBODY DIEM THE EMPLOYEE IS IS JUST NOT WHAT IS INTEGRATIVE AND WHERE THE THE WORK FORCE IS GOING. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT 47% OF -- MILLENNIALS PREFERRED THIS TYPE OF WORK AND THEY'RE THE NEXT GENERATION AND THEY PREFER THIS TYPE OF WORK [inaudible] THANK YOU. SEVERAL COURSES YEAH I'D COME BACK YOU WILL COME BACK. SENATOR JACKSON'S LIKE THAT COULD I HAVE THE OPPOSITION COME BACK -- FROM I THINK WAS THE THE UNION ABOUT. HOW TO TIGHTEN THIS UP -- WHAT WOULD SUGGESTIONS THERE MIGHT BE YEAH PLEASE IF YOU WOULD I APOLOGIZE? JUST A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING IN. PRESENTING A BILL SO I BUT I DID WANT -- TO PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THIS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A REALLY. IMPORTANT ISSUE ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE WORK IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE -- IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE SO -- I'D I THINK -- I WOULD HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE AUTHORED THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE A FEW BUSINESSES THAT WOULD EXPLOIT WORKERS I THINK A LOT OF BUSINESSES DO BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE EXTRA COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BEING AN pPENSION THEY DON'T WANT TO OFFER. SICK LEAVE THEY DON'T WANTED TO MEET. IF YOU SAID EVERYBODY YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN ULTIMATELY AT THE END OF THE DAY IT SAVES THESE EMPLOYERS I THINK A LOT OF MONEY AND THEN ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE. TRY TO GIVE EMPLOYEES AND WORKERS CERTAIN RIGHTS AND CERTAIN BASIC RESPECT AND A CERTAIN -- A SAFETY NET ARE ALL OUT THE WINDOW IN AND I APPRECIATE THAT MILLENNIALS LIKE CERTAIN FREEDOMS BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AT THE POINT YET I SUSPECT MOST OF THEM. WHEN THEY HAVE A SICK FAMILY MEMBER OR THEY NEED TO TAKE SOME KIND OF LEAVE OR -- THEY'RE GETTING OLDER AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A RETIREMENT AND DISCOVER THERE ISN'T ANY SO -- BUT BUT I DO THINK THERE'S A BALANCING HERE -- AND THAT'S WHY I WAS INTERESTED IN YOUR COMMENTS. HOW ARE I THINK THIS? I AGREE I THINK THIS THESE SIX CRITERIA. CALL FOR ALL SORTS OF YOU KNOW SPLITTING HAIRS I SEE THAT I SEE THIS IS A LAWYER'S DREAM. OF FULL EMPLOYMENT ACT WHICH IS IRONIC BECAUSE USUALLY I'M FEUD IS THE ONE THAT LIKES LAWYERS. AND WANTS TO SEE THEM BE DOING MORE WORK BUT THIS TO ME IS -- THIS REALLY WILL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY PARKS HERE'S LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS SO -- I DO THINK THAT THE THREE PART TEST OF DYNAMICS IS A GOOD ONE BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE. SOME PLACES WHERE WE COULD TIGHTEN IT UP AND I WOULD YOU MENTIONED THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHERE YOU. MIGHT. SEE THIS GOING SO THAT WE CAN CREATE A A LITTLE BIT MORE I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS BOTH ABOUT WHAT THE DYNAMICS TEST DOES AND MEANS FOR PEOPLE. AND ALSO THE WAYS THAT WE CAN CHANGE IT -- WITHOUT STRIPPING WORKERS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS SO I WOULD START BY SAYING -- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE DYNAMAX I MEAN IN THE CASE IT'S ABOUT A PACKAGE DELIVERY COMPANY AND THEY SAY THE PEOPLE DELIVERING YOUR PACKAGES CAN'T BE CALLED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR THAT'S ALL YOU DO YOU'RE A DELIVERY COMPANY THEY SHOULD BE YOUR DRIVER'S. ADDITION YOUR EMPLOYEES I'M. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT BY NO MEANS MEANS THAT A FINANCIAL PLANNER SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT COMPANIES AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN CLARIFY. BUT BOTH THE FACT THAT CERTAIN KINDS OF PROFESSIONALS ARE A LOT LESS LIKELY TO BE CLASSIFIED DON'T FACE THE SAME KINDS OF ISSUES -- BUT ALSO THAT THAT'S NOT WHO IS OUR PRIORITY TO TRY TO PROTECT THOSE ARE PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF MARKET POWER HIGHER INCOMES MORE EDUCATION MORE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CARVED OUT ALREADY FOR PROFESSIONAL CATEGORIES TO SAY YOU GUYS GO BACK TO CARRILLO TO THE MORE KIND OF NEW WANTS TO TEST RATHER THAN THE DYNAMAX. AUTOMATIC TEST BUT ALSO THIS ISSUE OF KIND OF BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CONTRACTING. IF YOU'RE A FINANCIAL PLANNER AND YOU WANT TO CONTRACT WITH DIFFERENT BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE THAT THAT RESOURCE. THAT PERHAPS IS THE TYPE OF BUSINESS TO BUSINESS ON ACTING AND I THINK THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE DYNAMICS DECISION THAT PREVENTS A BUSINESS IN FACT THE COURT TRIES TO DISTINGUISH. BETWEEN A BUSINESS THAT WANTS TO CONTRACT FOR SERVICES TO THE BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW IF THEY NEED A MECHANIC TO COME IN AND REPAIR THOSE DYNAMICS DELIVERY TRUCKS DOES IT NEED NOT BE EMPLOYEES OF DYNAMAX BUT IF THERE THE REGULAR DELIVERY DRIVERS. THEY SHOULD BE AND SO I THINK WE CAN CLARIFY THAT IN A WAY THAT WILL PUT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE'S MINDS AT EASE I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF HYPE THAT DYNAMAX WAS GONNA. STOP INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT THE DECISION DOES OR IS INTENDED -- TO TO DO TO THE ECONOMY IT'S REALLY MEANT TO SAY IF YOU ARE THERE WORKING FOR ONE BUSINESS DOING THAT REGULAR WORK IN THAT BUSINESS YOU'RE PROBABLY AN EMPLOYEE. SO I HAVE TO COME ON BEHALF OF PROBABLY MANY OF YOU OUT HERE WE'VE HEARD FROM YOUR HAIR DRESSERS -- ABOUT THE CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DYNAMICS IN THE RULING AND HOW THAT IMPACTED THEIR BUSINESSES. ALSO IF YOU TAKE SOMEONE WHO OWNS A SHOP. HAS FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE WHO QUOTE UNQUOTE WORK FOR HIM OR HER -- THEY THEY BUY THEIR THEIR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH THE THE HEAD OF THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY IS THE MASTER LESSEE -- THEY GET THEIR APPOINTMENTS SET UP THROUGH A COMMON PERSON WHO IS PAID FOR BY THE OWNER IF YOU WILL -- THAT THE EMPLOYEES OR THE WORKERS THERE -- GET A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE COST OF THE THE THE HAIR WORK THAT THEY DO -- ANYWHERE UP 25060% SO THEY'RE MAKING SIXTY EIGHTY DOLLARS AN HOUR [inaudible] UNDER THE INTERPRETATION THAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT IS I'VE BEEN VERY NERVOUSLY GETTING MY HAIR CUT. IN ORDER SHORT HERE YOU CAN'T DO TOO MUCH IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF MARGIN FOR ERROR -- IS THAT YOU END UP WITH -- OF SITUATIONS WHERE -- YOU'RE NOW AN EMPLOYER THEY'RE NOT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS EVEN THOUGH THEY BASICALLY ARE. MAKING SIXTY EIGHTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. FOR THEIR WORK -- AND SO YOU SHUT DOWN YOUR SHOP. AND AS I UNDERSTAND THERE A LOT OF HAIRDRESSERS WHO WERE NOW. KIND OF LEAVING THE PROFESSION -- THEY'RE NOT SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE OR THEY BUT THEY DON'T KNOW SHOP ANYMORE. EVERYBODY'S IN IT FOR THEMSELVES -- I'M NOT SURE WAS THAT WOULD TIENEN MAKES TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. IT CAN YOU I MEAN I I GET LESSEN. CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION YES I HAVE LEARNED SENATOR JACKSON IF WE WANT TO GET ANYTHING DONE WE GOTTA GET THE HEADREST ON BOARD YEAH BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE VERY STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THEIR HAIR DRESSERS. OF THEM. I THINK RIGHTLY SO YES AND RIGHTLY SO RIGHT WITH THAT I WILL SEE. WE ON BEHALF OF LABOR WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS NOW ON ON HOW TO DEAL HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS DECISION HOW TO CLARIFY THIS DECISION. WHO IS PROPERLY COVERED I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE WITHIN A SALON THERE ARE? A WIDE VARIETY OF LABOR ARRANGEMENTS SOME OF THEM LOOK A LOT MORE LIKE LEGITIMATE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT ARE PERHAPS RENTING A SPACE ALMOST MORE LIKE A LANDLORD TENANT ARRANGEMENT BUT A LOT. DON'T THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE AN EMPLOYEE ARRANGEMENT AND I THINK WE'RE WORKING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH THAT MODEL FROM A DIFFERENT MODEL AT OTHER HAIRDRESSERS WHERE. THERE'S A PRICE LIST ON THE WALL YOU'RE REQUIRED TO TAKE WALK INS ARE REQUIRED TO WORK CERTAIN HOURS THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE AN EMPLOYEE MODEL AND OUR GOAL IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DRAW THAT LINE SO THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE INDEPENDENCE. TO SET THEIR OWN RATES TO SET THEIR OWN HOURS ARE ABLE TO DO THAT LEGITIMATELY AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS NOT COVERED BY DYNAMAX. VERSUS EMPLOYEES WHO ARE KIND OF TOLD WHAT TO DO YEAH AND ARE GENERATING WORK OF THE EMPLOYER'S BUSINESS ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY AS EMPLOYEES SO I THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS JUST. CITING A HAIRDRESSER AND AND I THINK ALL THE FOLKS IN THIS FROM WHO USE HAIRDRESSERS WOULD AGREE IT IS A SENSITIVE TOPIC IS. BUT THERE ARE OTHER AREAS WHERE WHERE THE LACK OF CLARITY THIS IS WHAT WORRIES ME A LITTLE BUT NOT APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO GAIN CLARITY I JUST DON'T THINK. THAT THAT'S THE THE THE WAY TO DO IT -- ARE THERE -- GUIDELINES ARE THERE I DIDN'T TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS TFE H. FOR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THEY DOING ANYTHING TO TRY TO INTERPRET. A TO GIVE GUIDANCE TO BUSINESSES BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE FALLING IN A TRAP. ON THE OTHER HAND MY BIG CONCERN IS THAT YOU GET THESE COMPANIES WHO JUST DON'T TAKE ANY RISKS. BECAUSE IT IT IMPACTS OUR BOTTOM LINE -- AND THERE'S THERE THERE'S JUST A THERE'S A SWEET SPOT HERE AND I JUST DON'T KNOW I CAN'T QUITE GET A SENSE OF WHERETHAT IS SO YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL YEAH NO I I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT. WE RECOGNIZE THE REASON WE'VE SPENT SIX MONTHS MEETING WITH. JUST ABOUT EVERY BUSINESS. ORGANIZATION AND INDUSTRY ON THIS ISSUE WAS RE REALIZE THAT IT HAS A BROAD IMPACT -- AND THAT. ALSO WE'RE ALL KIND OF THESE ARE HYPOTHETICALS WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE COURT WOULD RULE I ASSUME IF THE HAIRDRESSER WHO WAS INDEPENDENT AND WITH SETTING HER OWN RATES. STUDENT SAID SHE WAS AN EMPLOYEE APART PROBABLY SAY YOU DON'T REALLY FIT THE DYNAMAX MODEL BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT SO THAT'S WHY WE HOUSE SPONSORED A BILL THAT WILL CODIFY THE RULING BUT MAKE THESE CLARIFICATIONS AND MAKE SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS. WHERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK THROUGH WITH AN INDUSTRY OKAY THIS IS HOW IT WORKS WITHIN YOUR INDUSTRY FOR EXAMPLE ER DOCTORS CAME TO US AND SAID WE'RE WORRIED DYNAMAX IS GOING TO AFFECT THE WAY THAT WE STAFF ER'S? EXPLAIN TO US THE WAY THEY SAPPY OURS WE FELT THAT THAT WAS CLEARLY NOT WHAT THE PORT WITH CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN THE ISSUE THE DYNAMICS DECISION. SO WE'VE SAID FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE E. R. DAS LET'S GO BACK TO PEROT. THEY DON'T NEED TO BE COVERED BY DYNAMAX WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE THOSE SAME KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS. ARE OUR POSITION IS BASICALLY THE CLEAR TESTED DYNAMAX SHOULD BE THE DEFAULT ROLE. BUT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO LOOKING AT AN UNDERSTANDING WHERE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE INTO DOING THOSE KINDS OF THANK YOU FOR CLARITY RESHAPED THAT VERY MUCH COULD YOU GIVE ME THE SITE THE BILL YOU SHOULD YOU. YOU'VE GOT A AB. FIVE THE BILL WILL BE HERE AT SOME POINT. RIGHT WE WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF CONSERVATION THANK YOU. VERY MUCH SENATOR JACKSON OF IF YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THAT -- ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CARVE OUT BILL THE CAR ABOUT TRAIN THAT'S COMING HERE FROM THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. IT DOES PLACE A VALUE ON SALON OWNERS WHO HAVE A VERY IMPACTFUL A VOICE ESPECIALLY WITH ALL OF US AND IN THE COMMUNITY AS IT DOES TO HIS PLACE TO CARVE OUT ON SALON OWNERS AND IT PLACES A HIGH VALUE ON DOCTORS WHO HAD A CONCERN ABOUT BEING ABLE. TO WORK IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM. BUT IT DOESN'T FOCUS ON SINGLE MOMS ARE GRANDPARENTS ARE RETIREES THE DRIVE FOR UBER AND LEFT. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SUPPLEMENT AN INCOME LIKE ONE OF OUR WITNESSES TESTIFIED TODAY. IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT HER INCOME IF SHE WAS IN UBER OR LIFT DRIVER SHE WOULD HAVE TO CREATE HER. OWN BUSINESS FILE ALL THE BUSINESS DOCUMENTS IN ORDER TO DRIVE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AS STUDENT A MILLENNIAL LIKE I SAID. IT'S GOING TO DRIVE A LITTLE. HI AFTER CAUGHT CLASS JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET OR TO HELP PAY FOR BOOKS IS GOING TO HAVE TO CREATE THEIR OWN BUSINESS PAY THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE. FOR THIS FOR THE CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF STATE FILINGS BEFORE THE EVEN TAKE ON THEIR FIRST. AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY ALL OF THAT UP FRONT ESTABLISH THEIR OWN BUSINESS DO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION IF THEY INCORPORATE OR WHATEVER JUST TO BE AT UBER LIFTDRIVER TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. ADDITIONAL INCOME THAT HELPS THEM LIKE I SAID PROBABLY BUY BOOKS OR OR DO WHATEVER AT SO. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A BILL THAT THAT THAT LABOR COMMUNITY IS WORKING ON WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BUT THIS BILL JUST MAKES IT EQUAL ACROSS THE BOARD REGARDLESS OF THE BUSINESS AND LIKE I SAID. I KNOW I'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN THE STATE I KNOW THERE ARE BAD ACTORS IN THIS STATE. BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT IN THE ENFORCEMENT ARM OF THE IT DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING TO GO AFTER THESE BAD ACTORS. AND THEN THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE FOR BUSINESS OR FOR EMPLOYEES AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN IN PLACE. BUT IT HAS TO BE UNIVERSAL WE CAN'T CARVE OUT IN AND PICK THIS COMPANY AND THIS COMPANY OR THIS INDUSTRY IN THIS INDUSTRY BUT NOT THIS INDUSTRY -- AND WE TALK ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE -- MAKE CALIFORNIA FOR DOUBLE HELPING PEOPLE MAKE ENDS MEET. AT THIS PARTICULAR BILL WILL ALLOW THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO UBER AND LYFT DRIVERS OR SALON OWNERS WHICH THEY'RE WORKING ON A CARVE OUT TO BE ABLE -- TO YOU KNOW PROVIDE THAT EXTRA INCOME THAT THEY NEED WITHOUT THAT -- YOU. YOU SET THEIR HOURS AND YOU KNOW WHAT IF AND WHAT IF A DRY KEEP GOING BACK TO UBER DRIVERS AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT OR LIFT DRIVERS. BUT WHAT IF YOU HAVE A DRIVER THAT WANTS TO WORK ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST ACTIVITY THAT YOU HAVE. OR EIGHTY SEVEN SIX THIRTY EIGHT THIRTY IN THE MORNING AND YOUR BOSS IS NOW YOUR HOURS ARE -- EIGHT TO TEN IT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU CAN SET YOUR OWN HOURS AND GENERATE YOUR OWN INCOME AND I JUST THINK THAT. THAT IS THIS BILL SB TWO THIRTY EIGHT WILL NOT DO CARVE OUTS BUT A LOT ALL ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO BE AN INDEPENDENT KIND CONTRACTOR THAT IS A TRUE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILY IN THAT MANNER. THANK YOU FOR AN INCIDENT. YEAH I WANNA MAKE SURE I HAVE MY MICROPHONE THANK YOU YOU KNOW I YOUR BILL I USED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR FOR FOR A LOT OF REASONS NUMBER ONE I'D LIKE THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE WORK MORE THAN ONE COMPANY. AND IF YOU WEREN'T BUT HE HAD TO pSHOW UP FOR MEETINGS. AND THAT DID NOT WORK TO MY ADVANTAGE IF SOMETHING WAS. HAVE BEEN OVER HERE WHERE YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE MORE MONEY IDEA LIKE BE MICROMANAGE AND IN SO GAVE ME A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AND AND I JUST I WORRY ABOUT THE DYNAMICS DECISION THAT IT WAS OUT THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO. WHO YOU KNOW WANT TO GO GO FOR IT SO TO SPEAK INSTEAD OF BEEN -- OVERLY MANDATE THEN SO THANK YOU FOR THE BILL BUT A COUPLE OTHER THINGS I GOT TWO QUICK QUESTIONS HERE COULD YOU -- EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH ABOUT THE SPECIAL CARVE OUT SET AND ALWAYS MAKES ME NERVOUS -- WITH I LIKE SEE THINGS. THIRTY FOUR ACROSS THE BOARD SO I THINK DYNAMICS -- THE WAY I SEE IT IS IT AND MISS VEGA DID EXPLAIN AS WELL AS AT DYNAMIX THE RULING CAME DOWN FROM THE SUPREME COURT AND BASICALLY SAID YOU'RE GOING TO DO AB AND C.. AND IF YOU COMPLY WITH AB AND C. THEN YOU'RE TRADITIONALLY EMPLOYEE WELL THAT MEANS BEING IN THE SAME TYPE OF BUSINESS WHICH IMMEDIATELY AFFECTED SOMEONE ORDERS WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT IN DEPTH. AT SO YOU HAVE AIDS SALON -- A HAIR STYLIST THAT RENTS ABUSE THAT SETS RUN APPOINTMENTS OR USES THE FRONT DESK WHEN THEY CALL AND SAY HEY IS JESSICA AND I NEED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT ABSOLUTELY ALLIGATOR BUT THAT QUALIFIED THAT PERSON TO BE AN EMPLOYEE AND NOT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. OR IT CREATES THE APPEARANCE OF IT FROM THE EMPLOYER'S PERSPECTIVE MAKING SURE THAT THEY WERE DOING ALL EMPLOYEES AND NOTHING ELSE BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA GET SUED AND HAVE TO GO BACK FOUR YEARS ON PENALTIES IN WAGES AND EVERYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH PARK IN THE PRIVATE WRITER ACTION AND EVERYTHING'S. ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND PLUS THE FOR YOUR PENALTY. SO YOU HAVE -- EMPLOYERS THAT I'M PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES WILL MAKE EVERYBODY AN EMPLOYEE JUST BECAUSE A PRECAUTIONARY ISSUES -- FIRTH OF RED OR THE APPEARANCE OF POSSIBLE LAWSUITS IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE OF DECISIONS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT IN COURT. AND I TAKE THIS LONG ORDER ISSUE OF MY SALON OWNER IMMEDIATELY CALLED ME AND SAID YOU KNOW HEY THIS IS A PROBLEM WE HAD AN ATTORNEY CAME IN AND AS MISS JACKSON SHE'S GONE NOW DID SAY. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO INSTEAD OF A HALF A PAGE AT LEAST WE WERE CREATIVE AND DID YOU KNOW TEN PAGE LEASE RIGHT DID YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ALL THESE THINGS AND MADE IT LIKE A LEASE TO HIM -- LIKE A VALLEY PLAZA OR EIGHT OR EIGHT RT MALL RIGHT YOU OPERATE WITHIN CERTAIN HOURS THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IT BECAME MORE OF A LEASE SEE LEAST LESSOR. ISSUE SO WE ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS NOT AROUND IT BUT JUST SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MAINTAIN HER FREEDOM IN THE WORKPLACE. AND THE CARVE OUTS THAT ARE BEING DONE DOCTORS WERE AFRAID REALTORS REFER EIGHTY INSURANCE AGENTS WERE OF GREAT SO THEY'RE ALL GETTING CARVE OUTS BUT AGAIN GOING BACK. TO AT THE MOST PROMINENT PROVIDER THEN CAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS TYPE OF ECONOMY IS UBER AND LIFT THE ARTIST YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN ARTIST HERE THAT MAKES A SUBSTANTIAL LIVING SUPPORTING HIS THREE KIDS AND HE WAS WORK TILL FOUR O'CLOCK. THIS MORNING WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO DO THAT IF HE WAS AN EMPLOYEE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE THOSE ANSWERS FOR HIM BUT HE WANTS TO BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. AT THE REFEREES AT OUR SCHOOL KIDS GAMES ON SATURDAYS THEIR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS BUT UNDER THAT. THE TEST FOR THE BUILDING TRADES AS WELL IF YOU ARE A ON INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR THAT DOES AT CONSTRUCTION DEBRIS REMOVAL THAT'S CONSIDERED IN THE CONFINES OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND YOU WOULD BE AN EMPLOYEE OF THE PRIME CONTRACTOR. SO THERE'S AND THERE'S JUST A LOT OF CONFUSION AND I FEEL LIKE THIS BILL IS -- DROP PUTS US IN LINE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THEN -- DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND A US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR THERE'S NO CONFUSION IT DOESN'T HIT -- IT CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS FOR MAKING A DECISION TO SUPPORT EITHER CALIFORNIA LAW ARE FEDERAL LANDA PENALIZED EITHER WAY FROM FROM EITHER. ONE AND AT YOU KNOW WE'VE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT AND EFFORT INTO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IT IT MET -- DIDN'T DEFAULT BACK TO THE CARRILLO TEST BUT MADE SURE THAT THERE IS AN ADEQUATE TEST TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS WORKER FREEDOM. THANK YOU YEAH ONE AND I'D LIKE THIS FOR THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE HEAD AND I'D BE. YEAH I JUST -- ONE ON THE QUESTION -- SORRY YES ABSOLUTELY WE RESPOND AND ALL ASK WHAT I I JUST. IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF WHAT'S BEEN SAID I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S A POINT OF CLARIFICATION IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE A MAKE MAKE CLEAR -- OKAY GO AHEAD YOU JUST BE BRIEFLY JUST ON DYNAMAX AND WHEN WHAT IT ACTUALLY SAYS AND THAT IS THE C. PRONG THE C. PROGNOSIS THIS ASSERTION THAT'S BEEN MADE THAT IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY BUSINESS YOU KNOW THAN THAN THEIR SOME WIGGLE ROOM. THE C. PRONG SAYS THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU HOLD YOURSELF OUT OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW AS BEING IN BUSINESS FOR YOURSELF IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE INCORPORATED YOU GOT ALL OF ALL OF THOSE ARE THINGS GO TO THE C. PRONG BUT JUST PASSING THE C. PRONG. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LOOK LIKE A BUSINESS NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU HOLD YOURSELF OUT TO THE WORLD OF BUSINESS. IF YOU DON'T PASS THE BI PRODUCT YOU'RE STILL. PROVIDING SERVICES THAT ARE SO ESSENTIAL TO THE BUSINESS BUSINESS MODEL OF YOURS. WHOEVER HIRES YOU YOU'RE GOING TO FUND THE DYNAMICS TAX SO. WE GOT SOME POINT POINT OF CLARIFICATION. YEAH. IT JUST IN EVEN EXPAND ON OUT IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT THAT THIS BILL WOULD CREATE AMBIGUITY. THAT WOULD BE EXPLOITED BY THE BUSINESSES TO MISS CLASSIFY WORKERS. BUT MISS CLASSIFICATION IS A PROBLEM -- IN THE UNITED STATES NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE ANSWER IS VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT -- AND AND AND DR WAS ALREADY YOU KNOW VIGOROUSLY ENFORCING. THE EXISTING STANDARDS I THINK WHENEVER YOU HAVE A BALANCING TEST OF ANY NATURE THERE IS GOING TO BE ROOM FOR ARGUMENT -- ON THE DIFFERENT FACTORS. AND THAT'S THE NATURE OF A BALANCING TEST. BOB BUT THE THE VIRTUE OF THE BALANCING TEST IS THAT. IT AVOIDS THE RIGIDITY THAT YOU HAVE WITH DYNAMAX -- AND THAT THIS IDEA THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WALK LIKE. AND TALK LIKE A LOOK LIKE A INDEPENDENT BUSINESS ON MY OWN MERIT -- THAT I'M STILL GOING TO HAVE TO BE TREATED AS AN EMPLOYEE. THAT THE PROBLEM. IT YOU KNOW WITH DYNAMAX IS THAT IT IS JUST UTTERLY REJECT AND YOU KNOW THERE AND AND THERE THERE'S A LOT OF OPEN QUESTIONS EVEN ABOUT DYNAMICS I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT I TALK TO PEOPLE. AND REYES ALL THE TIME ABOUT THE BE PROMPT WHAT HOW DO I KNOW IF I'M IN THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS BUT THIS BALANCING APPROACH IS VERY POP ONE OF THEIR SOMETHING REALLY TO BE SAID. FOR BRINGING US IN LINE WITH THE FEDERAL STANDARD THANK YOU. FOR THE QUESTION NO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH DAMAGE -- WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR GROUP. THANK. YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND THE REASON. WAS STATED ACTUALLY BETTER THAN I STATED IT WAS THE ATTORNEY FROM THE NFIB IS IS THAT. IS THE AIN REASON THAT THERE'S A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THE DYNAMICS TEST AND WHAT WAS INSTITUTED IS BECAUSE OF THE B. ****. I MEAN YOU CAN BE AN INDEPENDENT LIKE MISTER NICK -- HEALTH FROM THE BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TESTIFIED YOU CAN BE AN INDEPENDENT BUSINESS HAVE YOUR OWN INSURANCE. AND THEY WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE IN OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT WANT TO SET UP THEIR OWN BUSINESS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. AND TO NOT PASSED THE B. TEST BECAUSE THERE AB I DON'T KNOW THEY'VE HALL CONSTRUCTION LABOR LIKE YOU KNOW DEBRIS LIKE I SAID. AB THAT THEY'RE WORKING IN THE USUAL COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT OF THE CONTRACTOR WHO'S BUILDING THE PROJECT AND THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE CLASSIFIED AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR THEY ARE GOING TO BE CLASSIFIED AS AN EMPLOYEE. AND THEY'VE WORKED HARD TO HAVE THEIR OWN BUSINESS -- THEIR OWN BUSINESS SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE SENATOR WROTE AND I APPRECIATE REALLY -- APPRECIATE THE GOOD FAITH IN THE STRONG ATTEMPT TO MAKE TODAY AND AND IT IS GOOD BECAUSE I AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT YOU SAID. THE CHALLENGES WITH THE CAR ABOUT TO THE THERE'S A DISCOMFORT THERE AND AND I KNOW. IT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT I SEE WITH THE BILL THOUGH IS THAT IT IS. REPLACING DYNAMAX WITH THAT SIX PART -- REALITIES TEST IN IN IT IT'S IT SEEMS TO BE PUTTING US IN THE SAME UNCERTAINTY AS WE'VE HAD. WITH MORELLO AND HISTORICALLY IT'S NOT BRINGING IT TO THE POINT THAT. THAT THERE'S A UP. THE BE MORE CAN OR AS MUCH CONFUSION I BELIEVE AND IN THE STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE SO I I DON'T THINK IT GOES FAR ENOUGH IN SIMPLE FINDERS OR CLARA FIND WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND THAT'S HOPEFULLY WHAT. AT WHAT BINDING MAKES WILL DO. AT THE END OF IT I THINK IT RAISES SOME VERY IMPORTANT POINTS THOUGH I AM AT THANK YOU THE BILL DOES IN AND I WANT. TO TAKE A MINUTE. TO TO COMMENT ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM -- THE I. THE FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING COMMON RULES BECAUSE-THIS BILL WILL COME TO US AT SOME POINT AND WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TO TO TO SHAPE IT IN IN IN THE ANOTHER WAY OR DID AND MAYBE A LITTLE TWEAKING HERE AND THERE. TO TO MAKE IT BETTER WHICH IS THE GOAL WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO BUT THE ANALYSIS I THINK BRINGS UP OF SOME GOOD POINTS. ABOUT -- PRICE SETTING VERSUS WADE SETTING. AT BIG THAT'S REQUIRES MUCH MORE STUDY. A SECOND IS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER MYSELF. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR FOCUS ON SMALL BUSINESSES SENATOR. I THINK THAT'S A EXACTLY WHAT NEEDS TO BE TO OCCUR IN THIS BECAUSE THE CARVE OUTS ARE FOR THE THE BIG BUSINESSES THE PEOPLE THAT CAN. YELL THE LOUDEST -- BUT IT'S THAT BUSINESS TO BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. CAN TAKE ON MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS AND FORMS -- AND AND I% THINK THAT'S CRITICAL THAT WE LOOK AT PROTECT THAT IN SMALL BUSINESSES IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT FINALLY THIS ONE TO HIGHLIGHT. THE NEED IN IN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE MENTION THE RETROACTIVITY I THINK WE NEED SOME TYPE OF AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE FOR TO PROTECT THOSE BUSINESSES WHO. RELIED ON WITH THE LAW WAS AT THE TIME THEY DID KNOW THE CHANGES COMING AND RELIED ON THAT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE WE A PROTECT THAT. AND THAT THESE DAYS OF BUSINESSES COULD BE CRUSHED WITH THAT RETROACTIVITY IT COULD BE A MAJOR. MAJOR -- ACOSTA IN THERE SO BUT I AM OF SO THAT KIND OF RELIEF THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SHOULD GO TO THIS GOOD ACTORS THOSE WHO WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE AND GET IT RIGHT I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SEVERAL COMPANIES IN OUR STATE THAT OPERATE. WHO USE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND AND AND FRANKLY THEY USE THOSE CONTRACTORS IN IN A IN A CONSTRUCT? I FISH DEALS THE TIPS FROM THE WORKERS AND I THINK IT SHOULD SHAMEFUL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT -- IT'S A NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS LEGISLATIVELY AND I FIND THAT FUNDAMENTAL FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG. AS A MATTER WHAT HAPPENS LEGISLATIVELY I I WOULD EXPECT THOSE COMPANIES TO THAT THAT THE WHOLE OF WHAT I WOULD LOOK AT-AND I THINK WHEN WE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT TO EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR -- AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD STOP DOING THAT IMMEDIATELY SO -- I I THINK WE OF YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO THE OTHER PARTS THAT THAT IT COULD WORK BUT I THINK ON THE WHOLE I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT SO I WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR MORALE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THIS REVIEW TO WRITE REALLY BRING IT FORWARD TODAY AND HAVING THAT CONVERSATION A PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MISSION IS TO HAS TO APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR HILL NO. HELLO MERLE. HI I JACKSON. MITCHELL. MITCHELL NO PAN. THE ROLE WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU [inaudible] CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY. RECONSIDERATION OF COURSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THOSE TO THOSE WHO HERE TESTIFYING TODAY -- WHEN I MOVED TO LACI'S UNDER COVER OF? ITEM NUMBER SIX SB [inaudible] FIVE SIXTY SEVEN ONE TWO GOOD MORNING SENATOR GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS I AM PLEASED TO PROVIDE PERCENT SB FIVE SIX SEVEN WHICH WILL CREATE A WORKERS COMPENSATION REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR NURSES WHO PROVIDE DIRECT PATIENT CARE. IN AN ACUTE HOSPITAL SETTING FOR ISSUES SUCH AS INFECTIOUS DISEASE CANCER BACK INJURIES AND OTHERS WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS EXIST FOR CERTAIN FIRST RESPOND OR PROFESSION PROFESSIONS. BECAUSE THEY ARE INEVITABLY EXPOSED TO DOZENS OF POTENTIAL ILLNESSES AS A CONDITION OF THEIR WORK. MANY OF WHICH LEAD TO HELP THIS ISSUES SUCH AS INFECTIOUS DISEASES. RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES AND CANCERS. PRESUMPTIONS ARE A WAY TO STREAMLINE TREATMENT FOR WORKERS BY REDUCING THE BURDEN OF PROOF THAT THEIR INJURY OR ILLNESS WAS CAUSED BY A NATURE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. ONLY CERTAIN TIMES OF FIRST RESPONDERS ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION PROCESS PRESUMPTIONS AND THESE INCLUDE PROFESSIONS SUCH AS HE'S PARAMEDICS FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS. ALL OF WHICH ARE MALE DOMINATED FIELDS. MEANWHILE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO WORK IN THE HEALTH CARE SETTINGS SUCH AS NURSES ARE NOT ENTITLED TO WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS DESPITE THE FACT THAT NURSES ARE FIRST RESPONDERS TO THE SAME PATIENTS. IN HOSPITALS THE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS ARE TREATING IN THE FIELD. SB FIVE SIXTY SEVEN RECOGNIZES THAT HEALTH CARE WORKERS SUCH AS NURSES OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND FACE MANY OF THE SAME HEALTH RISKS AS PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL AS I SAID CREATES THE WORKERS COMPENSATION REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. FOR HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES WILL PROVIDE. IN AN ACUTE HOSPITAL SETTING. AND HAVE THE SAME EXPOSURE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES MUSCO SKELETAL INJURIES POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES. SB FIVE SIXTY SEVEN WILL MODERNIZE OUTDATED CALIFORNIA LAWS TO ENSURE IT FIRST RESPONDER HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS. AND IS A VITAL STEP IN ACHIEVING ECONOMIC AND GENDER EQUALITY I THINK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY. TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR AND WE HAVE. IF YOU WERE HERE EARLIER I ADDED IT -- THE SUPPORTERS IN SIX MINUTES PROPOSITIONS OF THAT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBER STEPHANIE ROBERSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION. MEMBERS TODAY ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS A LITTLE EQUITY. AND THE RULES TO BE APPLIED EQUALLY. LAST WEEK YOU INCREASE PRESUMPTIONS FOR COPS AND FIRE AS WE SIT HERE TODAY BUT WHAT SEEMS TO BE SOME STEP OFF OPPOSITION. I TO THE VERY SAME ISSUE. OPPOSITION THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAD SOME TIME TO WORK OUT -- BUT ALAS LAST NIGHT I DID GET A HOLD OF THE CHAIRMAN AND AND HAVE A CONVERSATION. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT ON AN ISSUE OF THIS MAGNITUDE WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMMITTEE SHOULD ENJOY A FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL WHEN SEVERAL MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE ACTUALLY VOTED. FOR A SMALLER SCALED DOWN VERSION OF PRESUMPTION. IT'S BEEN MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT WORKERS WHO ENJOY THE SAME PRESUMPTIONS IN THE PAST DID NOT MEET THE TEST TO GET CANCER PRESUMPTIONS I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD RECEIVE THEM. BUT YET THEY HAVE BEEN EXTENDED WE THINK PRESUMPTIONS ARE RUNAWAY TRAIN STOP EXTENDING THEM. INSTEAD YOU WOULD RATHER MAKE MY MEMBERS A TEST CASE AND MY MEMBERS HAVE ZERO PRESUMPTIONS. THE NUMBER ONE FEEDBACK THAT WE GET FROM PEOPLE WHEN WE EDUCATE. LEGISLATORS WE EDUCATE STAFF. IS THERE STUNNED THAT NURSES DO NOT GET ANY PRESUMPTIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL THE WHILE MY ONCOLOGY NURSES ON THE NIGHT SHIFT -- GETTING CANCER AT HIGHER RATES THAN ANY OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKER ARE FACILITIES PTSD CASES ARE UP 22% THIS ISN'T STRESS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT A SITTER IS. A SITTER OUR STAFF THAT SIT IN HOSPITAL ROOMS TO PREVENT MY MEMBERS FROM GETTING PUNCHED KICKED. STABBED CHOKED BUT GUESS WHAT MANY HOSPITALS HAVE SCALED BACK ON THE CENTERS. AND YES THIS IS ALL AFTER COMPREHENSIVE WORKPLACE VIOLENCE PENSION PROGRAMS ARE IN PLACE NOW THE SCENE A BILL THAT WE DID FIRST IN THE NATION. IF YOU SAY THAT WE MAKE THE CASE ON MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES. BUT THERE'S BEEN NO CONVERSATION OVER THESE PRESUMPTIONS. AND THIS IS AFTER ANOTHER SCENE A SPONSORED BILL TO ABATE NECK AND BACK INJURIES THE HOSPITALS ARE SCALING BACK ON LIFT TEAMS. WE NEED HELP FROM YOU WE NEED RELIEF. OUR RATES ARE HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER WORK IN AMERICA HIGHER THAN TRUCK DRIVERS YET THE DATA ISN'T ENOUGH WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE. THE REASON WHY YOU CAN'T GET DATE ON THE NILES AND WE PASSED OUT A LETTER. FROM GOOD SAM BASICALLY SUGGESTING THAT ARE NURSES USED THEIR SICK TIME AND AVOID THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM THAT'S THE PROBLEM MY MEMBERS WORK FOR MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS WERE BIG MONEY IS ON THE LINE HERE. AND MOST OF THE SYSTEMS WE USE ANY OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY CAN TAKE TO RETALIATE GETS MY MEMBERS. THESE NUMBERS ARE WHISTLEBLOWERS THEY WORK HARD ON BEHALF OF PATIENTS IN YOUR FAMILIES AND THEY DO WHAT'S RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT. THESE ARE HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS ARE TRAINED IN PHARMACOLOGY THEY'RE TRAINED IN SCIENCE AND THEY DO WHAT'S RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT. WE DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO HELP. WE'RE ASKING THAT YOU PLEASE CONSIDER THIS. ALL THE WHILE INDUSTRIES AND HOSPITALS ARE SKIPPING TO THE BANK BECAUSE THEY'VE ENJOYED HISTORIC SAVINGS IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. IT'S ALL I'M ASKING MEMBERS IF WE HAVEN'T MADE THE CASE ON MANY THESE PRESUMPTIONS I BELIEVE WE HAVE ON SOME. I AM WILLING TO ENTERTAIN AND I SAID TO THE CHAIR A SCALED BACK BILL ON A PRESUMPTION BILL THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE VOTED FOR IN PREVIOUS YEARS WHEN IT WAS A SKINNER BILL. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO START THE FLOODGATES ON OTHER PEOPLE COMING UP FOR PRESUMPTIONS YOU ALL ARE VERY SKILLED. POLITICIANS VERY SKILLED LAWMAKERS YOU CAN SAY NO TO THESE PRESUMPTIONS OF IT DOESN'T MEET THE TEST THAT YOU SHOULDN'T DO PUBLIC POLICY FOR IT IN THIS ISSUE. SO I'M ASKING IS YOU TO RECONSIDER THIS WILLING TO ENTERTAIN SOME AMENDMENTS WE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE MORE TIME AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS ROBERSON OTHER. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MR CHEN MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TALKING ABOUT WORKPLACE VIOLENCE AT HOSPITALS. A HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE INCREASINGLY ON THE FRONT LINES OF HANDLING ON SO MANY OF OUR SOCIETY'S FAILURES AND SO MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT DON'T GET SOLVED ANYWHERE ELSE OFTENTIMES IS RESULT IN VIOLENT ATTACKS THAT RESULT IN EXPOSURE. TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF ILLNESSES -- YOU EE THE RISE IN YOU KNOW IN THE QUALITY AND HOMELESSNESS AND SO MANY OF THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAT THEN TRANSLATE INTO EXPOSURE TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- ILLNESSES THAT MAY NOT HAVE EXISTED IN THE PAST I'M IN OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE IN THE FRONT LINES OF DEALING WITH THAT. ALSO I WOULD SAY OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM -- DEALS WE THINK FAIRLY WELL WITH EASY TO IDENTIFY INCIDENTS SOMEBODY FALLS AND GET YOU KNOW BREAKS THEIR ARM THAT'S PRETTY EASY FOR THE SYSTEM TO DEAL WITH. THE SYSTEM I THINK STRUGGLES A LOT MORE IN DEALING WITH -- ILLNESSES AND INJURIES THAT ARE SPECIFIED IN THIS BILL AND OFTENTIMES THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE I MEAN I REMEMBER THE STORIES. OF FIREFIGHTERS WHO WERE BREEDING AND TOXIC FUMES DURING FIRES IN GETTING CANCERS AND FACING TO NILES NOW WE HAVE NURSES FACING THE SAME THING WHO ARE GETTING HIGH CANCER RATES. ON AND SO THIS IS JUST A RECOGNITION THAT THESE ARE JOBS THAT ARE. INHERENTLY DANGEROUS AND INVOLVED IN THESE KINDS OF EXPOSURE AND THEN WHEN WORKERS STRUGGLING GET SICK THEY SHOULD BE PROTECTED IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT FOR CARE SO WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN THE OF OTHERS IN IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. AND BROAD ENOUGH TO NUTS THE BULLS WHO IN THE OPPOSITE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP ROUTE FOR THE TEAMSTERS ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMER ATTORNEYS IN SUPPORT THANK. YOU VERY MUCH BROAD. IT'S GOOD MORNING AMERICA'S ARMED HAVE THE CALIFORNIANS LIMIT LAWYERS' ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT -- IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE POINT OF THIS SHOW OF I DON'T KNOW IF IT AS AS SENATE CAREER THE THE THIS IS A LETTER FROM GOOD GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL WHAT WAS. TO THE POINT OF THE LETTER. CHAU THE EFFORTS OF THE EMPLOYER. TO DISSUADE -- REP WROTE A COUNTY ACCOUNTABILITY WAR TO DISSUADE PEOPLE FROM I'VE READ THE LETTER. FROM A FROM TAKING APPROPRIATE ACTION. TO KEEP THEM FROM FILING WORKERS COMPENSATION FOR A TORT AND I DON'T -- DOWN I THINK IT'S TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE LETTER SAYS. HI MY BELIEVE. THEY USE AVAILABLE SIX COVER PPO DURING THE TREATMENT HERE MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO TAP. THEY'RE SICK TIME A PPO BANK COME UP THROUGH THE TREATMENT IS NOT OTHERWISE PAID BY THE HOSPITAL THAT'S POINTS YEAH AND I WISH AND I APOLOGIZE TO THE COMMITTEE. MY LEADER AND THAT WORKS THAT -- GOOD SAM -- ACTUALLY WAS SWEPT UP INTO THIS LETTER. THIRTEEN SO IT. IS A DATE BUT IT DOES MAKE A POINT. IF THAT BEHAVIORS CONTINUING HERE OR ELSEWHERE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THANK THANK YOU THANK CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR -- YES OF SORRY. CATHERINE ALSO GOT RID OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION -- JUST ON THIS LETTER WE CAN LOOK BACK BUT I HAVE A VAGUE RECOLLECTION. THAT THERE WAS SOME -- INVESTIGATION WORK ON THIS LETTER SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP -- ON THIS AS WELL WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MERCED. MA'AM. I DON'T THINK WE WOULD ENDORSE THAT -- AT THANK YOU US SENATORS -- CALIFORNIA. CALPERS GOT CALIFORNIA HOSPTAL ASSOCIATION -- I FIRST NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT -- FOR HOSPITALS THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN OUR PATIENT SAFETY IN OUR EMPLOYEE SAFETY WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY. IS WHAT OUR EMPLOYEES DO HOW WE TREAT PATIENTS IS BECAUSE OF OUR EMPLOYEES SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO HEAR THAT WE MAY NOT BE MANAGING OUR WORK COMP SYSTEM AS WELL AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE FACTS TO COUNTER THAT A LITTLE -- WHEN WHEN WE KNOW THAT THE RESULT OF OUR GOOD PATIENT CARE IS BECAUSE OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND HOW WE HELP THEM THROUGH THEIR JOB WE HAVE? SO. FOR US I I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THAT THAT IS THAT IS -- NOT THE PICTURE WE'D LIKE YOU TO KEEP OF HOW WE MANAGE OUR EMPLOYEES -- AS SAID AND WE'LL GET TO THE CALLOW SHOUD PIECE HERE IN A SECOND BUT JUST QUICKLY -- WE DO WORK HARD -- TO TO MANAGE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR US -- I WANT TO GET STRAIGHT TO SORT OF THE DENIAL RATE IF I COULD -- FOR US HOSPITALS HAVE NOT SEEN SUBSTANTIAL -- DENIAL RATES ARE WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE EVIDENCE WE TOOK A FEW OF OUR HOSPITALS -- WE COULDN'T QUICKLY AND I'M OUT OF A COUPLE MONTHS PULL TOGETHER ALL OF OUR DENIAL RATES BUT WE TOOK A FEW OF OUR MEDIUM SIZE SYSTEMS. AND OUT OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CASES FILED -- OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD 15% MORE IN THESE CATEGORIES BUT ONLY 3% WERE DENIED AND THAT WAS AFTER A SUBSTANTIAL REVIEW -- WHICH IS WHAT THE WORK COMP SYSTEM I'M REQUIRES AND OUR HOSPITALS ENGAGE IN -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF PREVENTION POLICIES -- BOTH AS A PART OF THAT CAL OSHA SYSTEM THAT WILL BE NOTED BUT ALSO AS PART OF OUR WORK COMP SYSTEM. ON THE MUSCULAR SKELETAL INJURIES 50% 56% OF CASES WERE FILED OVER THAT SAME TIME -- AND ONLY 2% WERE DENIED SO I I AND WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH THE ACCUSATION THAT THERE'S A HIGH DENIAL RATE THERE ARE CASES BUT AGAIN -- THEY ARE BEING ADJUDICATED AND MANAGED IN THE SYSTEM THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS. I THINK THE APPLICATION THE PRESUMPTION IN THE WORK COMP SYSTEM ALSO. OPPOSES ADDITIONAL -- CONCERNS ESPECIALLY IN THE MASS OF I THINK WE'RE WORKING OUT I DIDN'T I DIDN'T COUNT BUT IT'S EIGHT I THINK -- THAT WOULD BE ADDED TO A PRESUMPTION SYSTEM -- AND THE PRESUMPTION PAUL CAN BE REFUTED WOULD BE HARD TO OVERCOME GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM I'M IN WERE SO THEREFORE COULD BE AN INSURMOUNTABLE HURDLE FOR US. I'M GIVEN THE DYNAMICS -- S. ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU CAN DO POST EMPLOYMENT. AS WELL SO IT GOES FORWARD AS WELL AND MANY OF OUR NURSES ARE. A LOT OF OUR NURSES WORK IN TWO DIFFERENT FIREMAN SO WE WOULD STRUGGLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY MANAGE IF THEY'RE WORKING PICKING UP A SHIFT AT A HOSPITAL EVEN A COUPLE TIMES A YEAR. AND HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT APPORTIONMENT -- I WANT TO LEAVE TIME FOR OTHER CAL OSHA PREVENTION EFFORTS SUCH A REAL A REAL PART OF WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY -- AND THEN FOR THE WORK COMP PROVIDERS TO TALK ABOUT THE VERY GOOD THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING GAIL BUDGET FIGURE WITH A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I'M I DID WANT TO ADDRESS -- THE ISSUE IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT NUMBER NUMBER TWO ISSUE OF THAT YOU CONSIDER IS IT POSSIBLE TO EVADE THESE INJURIES ARE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS THROUGH SUPERIOR SAFETY ROLES -- AND I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ALL OF THE WORK THAT ALREADY. HAPPENS -- IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST CAL OSHA AGENCY. WE HAVE OBLIGATIONS HOSPITALS AND ALL EMPLOYERS HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO HAVE AN INJURY AND ILLNESS PREVENTION PLAN. WHICH REQUIRES IDENTIFICATION OF RISKS AND MITIGATION ARE BRASS OVERALL AND ON TOP OF THAT. HELLO CHAU HAS -- AND IN SOME PART -- DUE -- TO PREVIOUS EFFORTS OF THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL TO GET LEGISLATION AEROSOL TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASE STANDARD BLOOD BORNE PATHOGENS STANDARD SAFE PATIENT HANDLING STANDARD WORKPLACE VIOLENCE PREVENTION STANDARD. HELLO JUST CONSIDERING ANTINEOPLASTIC DRUG HANDLING STANDARD WHICH WOULD DEAL WITH THE HANDLING OF CANCER -- COMPOUNDS -- WHICH ACTUALLY KIND OF THROUGH THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND THAT ADVISORY COMMITTEE REALLY APPEARS TO BE MORE OF AN ISSUE AND POSITION OFFICES AND HOSPITALS. HOW MUCH I'LL TALK ABOUT -- AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AS WELL AS LABELING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS I MEAN THERE'S JUST IT'S A VERY CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AS OPPOSED. TO THE OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS THAT ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY -- AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT REQUIRES VERY RIGOROUS INFECTION CONTROL STANDARDS. SO WHERE WE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY -- FOR GOOD GOOD OPPORTUNITY -- FOR ABATING THESE INJURIES AND OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AND AS AS CAT EXPLAIN WHERE THEY DO ARISE THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS. PROBABLY TALK ABOUT IS ALREADY LEANING IN FAVOR OF AN EMPLOYEE AND ASSUMING THE THE THE INJURY IS WORK RELATED -- AND THEN SO WITH ALL TING IN A PRETTY LOW DENIAL RIGHT EXACTLY THAT I'LL. HAND IT OVER TO JASON'S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FRUSTRATION SMELTER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION AND SEE SEC ACCESS INSURANCE AUTHORITY -- REALLY QUICKLY UNDERSTAND RULES OUT OF TIME US TO SPEAK TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM THERE IS -- IT IS A NO FAULT SYSTEM -- IF INJURIES OCCUR IN THE COURSE AND SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT THEY RE COVERED BY THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM -- SECONDARILY THERE IS A CLAUSE IN THE LABOR CODE KNOWN AS THE LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION CLAUSE THAT ESSENTIALLY SAYS -- HI GOES TO THE RUNNER THE RUNNER BEING THE INJURED WORKER THE SYSTEM SHALL. BEND TOWARDS THE INJURED WORKER -- WITH THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING BENEFITS. SO WE THINK THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE RELATIVE TO OTHER PRESUMPTIONS I THINK AS WAS POINTED OUT. A BY THE SPONSORS IN THE SUPPORTERS AND WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE NECESSARY THE ANALYSIS DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF IDENTIFYING ASKING SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT -- WE AND YOU ALL TEND TO ASK WHEN PRESUMPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE -- YOU KNOW WHAT DATA IS THERE TO INDICATE. THAT THERE'S A HIGHER INCIDENCE pKNOW WHAT DOES WHAT ARE THE PREVENTIVE MEASURES -- AND WHAT ARE THE DENIAL RATES AND I THINK THE ANALYSIS DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF SHOWING THE LACK OF OF DATA AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THIS PARTICULAR POLICY. IT WAS MENTIONED -- THE PRIOR VERSIONS OF THIS BILL HAVE BEEN PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE OTHER COMMITTEES THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE -- THEY'VE ALSO BEEN VETOED -- IN A BI PARTISAN NATURE BY SEVERAL GOVERNORS TO GOVERNOR'S -- AND THIS PARTICULAR VERSION IS BY MY ESTIMATION THE MOST EXPANSIVE VERSION OF THE HOSPITAL WORKER PRESUMPTION THAT HAS EVER BEEN -- HEARD BY THIS COMMITTEE OR ANY OTHER COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE -- IT FOCUSES ON ALL HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES. IT PROVIDES FOR TEN YEARS POST TERMINATION ACCESS TO THE PRESUMPTIONS -- IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN THIS IS KIND OF A BIG DEAL TO US IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT A PRESUMPTION WOULD BE EXPANDED INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- UP UNTIL NOW IT'S BEEN KIND OF A GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT -- THING FOCUSED ON PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS AND THEIR VERY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES -- INTO THE TO THE POINT THAT THE SUPPORTERS MADE EARLIER WE DON'T SUPPORT THOSE PRESUMPTIONS EITHER WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE NECESSARY FOR THE EXACT SAME REASONS -- AND IN THE BIG KICKER I THINK IN THIS BILLS THAT YOU CAN'T GO BACK AND CONSIDERED PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS SO YOU ARE REALLY LOOKING AT SOME IMPACTS ON APPORTIONMENT. I WHICH IS A COMPLETELY RATIONAL THING THAT EXISTS IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM -- AND FINALLY THAT THE COMMENT WAS MADE EARLIER AND I HAVE TO ADRESS IT ABOUT THE HISTORIC SAVINGS IN THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. AT NIGHT OF MY MEMBERS KNOW WHAT THAT'S IN REFERENCE TO WE HAVE THE SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE SYSTEM IN THE IN THE UNITED STATES. BY WIDE MARGINS I WILL RATE WERE EXPENSIVE BUT WERE STABLE WE APPRECIATE THE STABILITY ALLOWS US TO PRICE AND MANEUVER AND AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE THESE BENEFITS YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATED OTHERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE DO CHAIR PHIL VERMAELEN REPRESENTING ACCLAMATION INSURANCE MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND ALLIED MANAGE CARE. I THINK IT'S BEEN SUMMED UP PRETTY WELL WE HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. AND WOULD URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. MORNING GOOD MORNING FIFTH LARGEST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IS WITH A LINER COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION WITH AS AN INSTRUCTIONAL SIR THANK YOU. THE MORNING LOWER CURTIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION THIS BILL CAL CHAMBER DOPPLER THIS YEAR THANK YOU. THE CREATURE ON BEHALF OF UNITED HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. YOUR MEMBERSHIP LEVINE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. TWENTY DELGADO AND HAVE THE DISTRICT HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP FORUM IN OPPOSITION. NUMBER CAN WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS AND ALSO BE TO HEALTH CARE GROUP IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING NO ONE ELSE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- IS CLEAR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED SPELL AND ALSO TO TO HEAR THE OPPOSITION -- BOTTOM LINE IS IS THAT -- THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE THAT -- NUMBER ONE IS IT IT'S AN EXPANSION INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- AND YES YES IT IS -- AND IF THERE'S A GOOD REASON. IT WHETHER IT'S AN EXPANSION INTO THE PUBLIC SECTOR OUR PRIVATE SECTOR NOT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT THE OTHER ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE THAT IT'S A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT'S INDOORS AND IF YOU'VE EVER. BEEN IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM -- AND SPENT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME WHICH AND FORTUNATELY IT HAD TO DO A NUMBER OF YEARS. PAST AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST CHAOTIC PLACES -- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT CULT TO CONTROL WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WALKS IN THE DOOR OR WHAT IS CARRIED IN THE DOOR -- AS AT BACK BY THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND AND AND JUST AS CHAOTIC AS IT IS OUT DOORS IT CHAOTIC IN THAT IN THAT -- IN THE AT THE HOSPITAL SETTING THEY DO THE BEST THEY CAN TO TRY TO CONTROL THE ENVIRONMENT BUT MANY TIMES IT'S JUST IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE AND SO -- IF IF THE ARGUMENT IS THAT WE NEED TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS -- AS WELL AS TO NARROW THAT -- KINDS OF INJURIES -- BUT THE DATA THAT WE HAVE CHAU FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY THAT THE INCIDENCE OF OF OF INJURY AND ILLNESS IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AMONG NURSES. AND THE THE INFORMATION FROM THE CALPERS JOURNAL INDICATES WORKERS COMPENSATION. COMPENSATION HAVE SUNK TO A FIVE YEAR LOW WHICH IS A GOOD THING -- IT'S OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO KEEP THAT UNDER CONTROL BUT BUT REALLY AS WE LOOK AT THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. YOU CAN EITHER SPEND A LOT OF MONEY TRYING TO DENY WORKERS THE ABILITY TO GET -- COVERAGE OR YOU CAN PUTTHE MONEY INTO -- IMPROVING THE HEALTH CARE OF THE WORK. INJURED OR ARE ILL AND QUITE FRANKLY THE EASIEST PLACE TO DO IT IS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WHERE THE HOSPITAL HAS THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE WHATEVER IT IS THAT THAT -- THESE NURSES NEED -- IN TERMS OF OF OF CARE AND SO -- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THE COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT WE SPENT. LAST EVENING AND AND AND ON THE TELEPHONE -- AND I KNOW THIS IS IT IT DEEPLY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO YOU PERSONALLY. YES I HAVE. TO OF NOTHING BUT THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR THE WORK THAT NURSES DO EVERYDAY TO SAVE ALL OF US TO STRIP CREEK. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S IT'S ON GOING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY WITH THAT. BUT AS WE'VE TALKED DIE I'M NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- IT BEFORE I GET INTO SOME OF THE REASONS I I WANT TO STRESS ONE POINT. YOU KNOW IT WAS RAISE THE ISSUE OF LAST WEEK WHERE WE DID VOTE -- FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS PRESUMPTION BILL -- ARGUING THAT A VOTER FOR THAT BUILDING WE SHOULD SUPPORT THIS BILL THE DOG I REJECT THAT THAT ARGUMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE DIFFERENT BILLS. AND DIFFERENT WORKER. FOR ONE THING THE FIREFIGHTERS BROAD DATA TO THE TABLE THAT SHOWED HIGHER INCIDENCES OF SUICIDE AMONG POLICE OFFICERS PEACE OFFICERS. N. WITHOUT THAT DATA I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT BILL. COULDN'T SUPPORTED THAT BILL ON THE BASES -- CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO INDUSTRIAL PRESUMPTIONS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS WE KNOW. THIS WOULD MARK THE FIRST TIME. OF MAKING THE DECISION TO PRIVATE SECTOR. PRESUMPTIONS OUT OF WHOLE CLOTH REQUIRES REALLY AT A MINIMUM DATA THAT SHOWS IT'S NECESSARY AND WE DON'T HAVE. ENOUGH DATA TO DO THAT AS WITH DETAILED IN THE ANALYSIS. RIGHT NOW WE LACK THE DATA TO CREATE A NEW SET OF PRESUMPTION FOR NURSES EVEN IN THE CASE OF OF MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES WHERE WE KNOW NURSES. SUFFER FROM THESE ENTRY INJURIES AT A VERY HIGH RATE. WE'LL LACKEY DATA THAT SHOWS THE HOSPITALS. ARE DENYING LIABILITY FOR THOSE INJURIES SO IF THEY'RE GETTING THE THE THE THE WORKERS COMP. ALREADY THAN THIS DOESN'T WOULDN'T CHANGE THAT TO WITHOUT THE DATA HOW CAN WE KNOW THAT THE PRESUMPTIONS ARE NECESSARY AND THAT'S REALLY THE CRITICAL ISSUE HERE -- THE DATA IS ACCESSIBLE. IT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND AND WE'RE READY AS WE MENTIONED LAST NIGHT TO TO MAKE SURE WE GET THAT DATA SO THAT WE CAN -- SO THAT WE CAN USE IT AND AND MAKE IT TO THE BEST A AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOMETHING RESOLVED IN THIS ISSUE BUT BUT I'M I'M FORTUNE NOT ABLE TO TO SUPPORT. THE BILL [inaudible] TODAY. OTHER COMMENTER. INS. JEAN NONE OF THEM. YOU FOR CLOSING THE IS THERE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION -- AND THIS WOULD BE DUE TO PASS. TO A PROPERTY PROCREATION SO WHAT -- WOULD YOU PLEASE. THE MOTION IS THE BEST TO APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR HILL A NO. HELL NO MORALE. JACKSON. MITCHELL [inaudible] PAN. THE WHOLE THE ROLE OF THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE TESTIMONY TODAY. RACIAL SENATOR BRADFORD HERE. SIR BRADFORD PLEASE. ITEM NUMBER EIGHT WE'RE MOVING TO SB. SEVEN THIRTY ONE AND I'M GOING. THANK YOU -- GOOD MORNING -- TO MISTER CHAIRMAN CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SB. SEVEN THREE ONE EXPLOSIVE PROHIBITS WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS ON THE BASIS OF IMMUTABLE FACTORS SUCH AS RACE GENDER AND GENETIC MAKE UP THIS BILLS RESPONSE TO A RECENT COURT DECISION. ON WHICH AN INJURED WORKERS A PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFIT WAS REDUCED BY 49% BECAUSE OF A GENETIC DISPOSITION THE COURT'S DECISIONS OPENS THE DOOR TO RACE GENDER AND OTHER FACTORS BEING USED AS A BASIS. FOR REDUCING BENEFITS WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT I WORKERS OF COLOR SB SEVEN THREE ONE CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE BY PROHIBITING THE CONSIDERATION OF SUCH FACTORS WHEN MAKING A DETERMINATION ON DISABILITY CLAIMS. THIS BILL PROVIDES ADDED PROTECTION FOR A FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS AND ENSURES THAT THEY ARE TREATED EQUALLY AND FAIRLY IN RECEIVING THEIR WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS.

ELEVEN YEARS AGO AN INJURED WORKER NAMED MILTON JONES TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN FIFTEEN MAKE DIDN'T SPELL. MISTER JONES TEARFULLY EXPLAINS TO THE COMMITTEE THAT HIS PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS HAD BEEN CUT. 50% BECAUSE OF HIS-PREDISPOSITION TO HYPERTENSION AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. NUMEROUS BILLS SIMILAR TO S. B. SEVEN THIRTY ONE TO ELIMINATE BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION IN CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. HAVE BEEN PASSED AND UNFORTUNATELY VETOED. THESE BILLS HAVE A LOT OF CONFLICT IN THE LAW TO DEVELOP. GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION ONE ONE ONE THREE FIVE PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF VARIOUS IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS SEX RACE OR GENETIC INFORMATION. BUT AS CENTER BRADFORD MENTIONED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CITY OF JACKSON CASE THE INJURED WORKERS PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS WERE REDUCED 49%. BECAUSE OF IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF GENETICS AND HEREDITY. THIS CONFLICT BETWEEN STATUTORY AND CASE LAW MUST BE RECTIFIED BY THE LEGISLATURE WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW REDUCTION IN PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS. TO FEMALE WORKERS BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER OR OLDER WORKERS BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE OR PEOPLE OF COLOR BECAUSE OF THEIR GENETICS THE BEST WAY TO REMEDY THIS BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE STATE'S WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM.

FOR BEING HERE WE'RE MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER TEN IS J. R.. THREE FOR C. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- PRESENT TO YOU TODAY SENT -- SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION THREE WITCHER'S IT URGES THE U. S. CONGRESS AND PRESENT IT TO REPEAL TO HEART HARMFUL FEDERAL POLICIES. THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT PENSION OFFSET ALSO NOTICED AYE GPL AND THE WIND FILL -- WIND FALL ELIMINATION PROGRAM TO BE E. P.. THE G. E. R. P. O. N. W. E. P. WERE INTRODUCED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AS A WAY TO PREVENT YOU KNOW DOUBLE DIPPING. FROM GOVERNMENT BENEFITS BECAUSE OF THE GPO GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES MAY SEE THEIR BENEFITS SLASH TO THEIR SPOUSES EMPLOYMENT QUALIFIES HIM FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. SIMILARLY THE DEBBIE P. PENALIZES THOSE WHO HAD IT HAVE A ONE TIME WORK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND QUALIFY FOR SO SECURITY. THEN LATER GOING TO WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS PARTICULARLY HARMFUL TO PEOPLE HAVE. PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERIENCE AND GO AND TEACH AND WON A BIG CONCERNS BESIDES THE EQUITY ISSUE. IS OUR ABILITY AS A COUNTRY TO COMPETE IN THE AND STEM. AND YOU HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE. THAT CAN IMPART GREAT KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM TO OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR PENALIZE ARE A LOT OF TIMES THEY SIGNED UP AND DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE GONNA BE PENALIZED TO LATER THAT'S TRUE ANYWAY THESE INDIVIDUALS. MAY SEE THE RIGHTFULLY EARNED SO SECURITY BENEFITS CUT BY MORE THAN HALF DUE TO THESE FLOOD LAWS. THESE POLICIES WERE INTRODUCED WITH LITTLE OR NO ANALYTICAL RESEARCH DONE BEFOREHAND. LEADING TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THEY'RE OFTEN ESPECIALLY HARMFUL TO ALREADY DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS. THE FLOOD FOR ME IS BEHIND THE POLICIES OFTEN LEAD TO STRICTER PENALTIES FOR THOSE WITH LESS INCOME FROM NON GOVERNMENT EMPLOYERS. THIS CAN VERY WELL MEAN LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS ARE THE ONES WHO LOSE THE MOST THE GPO AND DEBBIE P. MAY HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT. BUT INSTEAD THEY HAVE RESULT IN THE GOVERNMENT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HIS PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE OF ITS MOST DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS TEACHERS POLICE OFFICERS FIREFIGHTERS AND NUMBER OF OTHERS IN PUBLIC SERVICE. MANY OF WHOM ALREADY STRUGGLE WITH THE RELATIVELY YOUNG A LOW INCOMES ARE CONSISTENTLY HEARD BY RETIREMENT POLICIES IT'S WELL PAST TIME THAT THAT THAT THE CONGRESS IN THE MINISTRATION -- FIX THIS AND WE HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE HERE TO TESTIFY THANK YOU SENATOR WILL COME I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT S. G. R. THREE TODAY WE'D LIKE TO THANK CENTER WILK FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD -- WE'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS WOMEN AS 72% OF CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATORS ARE WOMEN SO WE APPRECIATE YOU STANDING UP FOR WOMEN ESPECIALLY ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT DAY -- WE'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IT -- POLICY TO TRY TO RECRUIT RETAIN EDUCATORS AS A SECOND CAREER JUST AS WAS NOTED IN THE BILL SO THAT'S BEEN PART OF CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATIONAL POLICY FOR A NUMBER OF DECADES TO TRY TO RECRUIT RETAIN INDIVIDUALS FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. BUT MANY OF THEM HAVE NOT UNDERSTOOD THE IMPACT THAT THIS WILL HAVE ON THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS THEY DISPROPORTIONATELY DON'T FIND THIS OUT UNTIL THEY GO TO RETIRE AND SUDDENLY. THERE HIT WITH THIS HORRIBLE REALIZATION WE TRIED TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO EDUCATE OUR MEMBERS WITHIN CTA CAL STIRS ALSO DOES A PHENOMENAL JOB TRYING TO EDUCATE MEMBERS AHEAD OF TIME. TO HELP EDUCATORS TO UNDERSTAND YOU NEED TO CONTACT SOCIAL SECURITY TELL THEM YOU'RE IMPACTED -- BY THE WEAPON GPO POTENTIALLY AND TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS ARE GOING TO BE. UNFORTUNATELY MOST RETIREES DON'T FIND OUT ABOUT THE GPL INTEL THEIR SPOUSE PASSES AND CERTAINLY NOT ONLY ARE THEY ALREADY DEVASTATED FROM THE LOSS OF A SPOUSE OR PARTNER BUT THEN THEY'RE ALSO SEVERELY IMPACTED POTENTIALLY. BY THE OFFSET OF THE GPO SO WE BELIEVE THAT IF CONGRESS CAN PASS THE PROVISIONS TO ELIMINATE THE WEAPON GPO THAT'S CAN ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S RETIREES DISPROPORTIONATELY WOMEN CAN BE PROTECTED AND CAN CONTINUE. TO BE RETAINED IN THE EDUCATIONAL FIELD. THANK YOU. MORE DAVE ALL RATS REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THE PEOPLE WHO OFFICE SEVEN DISCOVER ON THE DEATH OF A SPOUSE WITH A FAMILY INCOME. HAS BEEN RADICALLY SLASH. THE SURVIVOR BENEFIT UNDER SOCIAL SECURITY IS PAID BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY EARNERS. NOT THE RECIPIENT OF THE SURVIVOR BENEFIT SO IT'S EFFECTIVELY THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS. THANK YOU YOU BOUGHT A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY TO PROTECT YOUR SPOUSE WHEN YOU DIE. A CREDIT UNION LIFE INSURANCE POLICY FOR A LOT LESS MONEY WE'RE NOT GOING TO PAY. THIS CREATES TREMENDOUS HARDSHIP ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE ESSENTIALLY FAIRLY LOW RETIREMENT ALREADY. WITH PENALTY OUT IN FEDERAL COULD HAVE FOR BOTH WEB END GPO COMBINED. IT CREATES GREAT HARDSHIP TO RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION ISSUES YOU HEARD -- WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND WE ALSO THANK SENATOR WILK FOR AUTHORING THIS VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD IF YOU. COULD STATE YOUR NAME AND FILIATION IN. YOUR STATE CHAIRMAN A MEMBERSHIP LIST OF ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA STATE RETIREES AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MORNING GOOD MORNING MARIANNE ASHLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION THESE FORWARD. SO SEE NO ONE OF REFER YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE STATION HI THIS IS IT'S VERY GOOD THAT THE I MEAN THESE PROVISIONS REALLY HARM PEOPLE AND THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT SO UNFAIR SHOWING JUST. PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVING US. IN FURTHER THEIR CAREERS THEIR LIFE AND THEN TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN IT'S IT'S JUST IT'S NOT FAIR I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING FORTUNATE WILL THANK YOU. CONVERSE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. WE'RE WORKING ON BACK AND AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE SO IT'S GOING TO BE PART OF A BROADER SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM EFFORT. BUT AGAIN IT'S IT'S NOT EQUITABLE AND IT I THINK IT'S GONNA HARM IS A IN TERMS OF BEING COMPETITIVE ECONOMICALLY WITH OTHER NATIONS BECAUSE WHEN I AM GOING. TO ATTRACT THE TALENT WE NEED SARAH GOOD POINT THE RELEASE OF THANK YOU. THE MOTION FROM THE SENATOR MITCHELL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS SENATOR HILL HI. I'M AROUND [inaudible] JACKSON. MITCHELL AYE MITCHELL I CAN. TWO TWO ZERO WILL HOLD THE ROLL OVER TO THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK. GOD THANK YOU [inaudible] TODAY [inaudible] WE HAVE. BIG SENATOR JACKSON WAS A PRESENTED A BILL IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE AND SENATOR WIENER IS AS WELL HI [inaudible] EXCEPT. WHAT WERE YOU DOING? TO PROVIDE. TO AND TO BE HEARD. I KNOW HI YEAH [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH THIS IS ME YEAH I KNOW GET THAT. WELCOME IS JACKSON -- WE'RE IN THE SONG. WELCOME IS JACKSON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ALL RIGHT MISS JACKSON WE ARE YEAH I HEARD SOMEBODY SING THE SONG I COULDN'T I COULDN'T I COULDN'T GET THAT. KEY -- MISS JACKSON WE ARE PREPARED I AM. PREPARED TO HEAR FROM YOU ON SB ONE THIRTY FIVE WELL I AM DELIGHTED TO PRESENT ON THAT ITEM AND A CHAIR. MADAM CHAIR. SHORTLY AFTER GOVERNOR NEWSOME TOOK OFFICE HE TALKED ABOUT THE KEY IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY LEAVE FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT. AND ANNOUNCED HIS DESIRE TO SEE CALIFORNIA OFFER SIX MONTHS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE FOR EVERY NEW BORN. BORN IN THE STATE. I COULD HAVE BEEN MORE EXCITED BY HIS ENTHUSIASM HAVING WORKED FOR YEARS ON THIS ISSUE AS I KNOW YOU HAVE AS WELL. CHAIR. IT'S IN THE SPIRIT OF NOW IS THE TIME TO GET THINGS DONE THAT I BRING THIS BILL TO YOU. THE BILL A CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY. WOULD SET US ON A PATH TO FIXING SOME LONG STANDING INEQUITIES IN INCONSISTENCIES IN OUR FAMILY LEAVE LAWS BY STRENGTHENING THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CIFRAS. WHICH ACTION IS A JOB PROTECTION FOUNDATION OR ARE PAID FAMILY LEAVE WAGE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM. A CORNERSTONE OF CALIFORNIA'S LEAVE RIGHT SIR FROM OFFERS AN ASSURANCE FOR THOSE WHO QUALIFY. THAT IF TAKE OUR THAT IF THEY CAN TAKE UP TO TWELVE WEEKS OFF TO CARE FOR A NEWBORN. OR A SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY MEMBER OR THEMSELVES. THEIR JOB WILL STILL BE THERE WHEN THEY RETURN. BUT THE OPERATIVE PHRASE IS FOR THOSE WHO QUALIFY. UNFORTUNATELY FOR FAR TOO LONG FOR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE NOT HAD RETURNED TO WORK RIGHT. BECAUSE THAT RIGHT IS ARBITRARILY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAW BY THE SIZE OF ONE'S EMPLOYER. ONCE FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND THE AMOUNT OF TENURE SOMEONE'S HAD AT THEIR JOB THAT MEANS THAT MILLION TO PAY INTO ARE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM AND THAT'S EVERYBODY BY THE WAY ON THIS D√≠AS. BECAUSE A PORTION OF OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FROM OUR PAYCHECK GOES INTO THIS BLOCK TO COUNT FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE BUT YOU CAN PAY YOU HAVE. TO LOSE YOUR JOB FOR ACCESSING -- ACCESSING A BENEFIT THAT YOU'VE ALREADY PAID. FOR SO CURRENTLY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS TO PAY INTO THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM COULD LOSE THEIR JOBS FOR TAKING TIME OFF TO BOND WITH A NEWBORN. FIVE POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS COULD LOSE THEIR JOBS FOR TAKING TIME OFF TO CARE FOR A SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY MEMBER. TO FIX THESE INEQUITIES SB ONE THIRTY FIVE WILL ENSURE THAT NEARLY EVERYONE WHO PAYS INTO THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. WILL BE ABLE TO USE IT WITHOUT LOSING THEIR JOBS. BY EXPANDING CIFRA TO EMPLOYEES WHO WORK FOR EMPLOYERS OF FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES. CURRENTLY THE EMPLOYER THRESHOLD IS FIFTY FOUR CARE GIVING CLAIMS AND ONE'S OWN ILLNESS AND TWENTY FOR BABY BONDING UNDER THE NEW PARENT LEAVE ACT. I WOULD ADD THAT NEW YORK IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF A MULTI YEAR PHASE IN OF A FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM THAT APPLIES TO ALL EMPLOYERS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR SIZE. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MOVE THIS. TO FIVE THIS BILL ALSO MAKES KEY CHANGES ON WORK TEN YOUR REQUIREMENTS AND ADDS IMPORTANT FLEXIBILITY. CURRENTLY AN EMPLOYEE WHO QUALIFIES UNDER SIR. FOR THE JOB PROTECTION. HAS TO WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER FOR TWELVE MONTHS AND HAVE AT LEAST TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS UNDER THEIR BELT TO QUALIFY FOR JOB PROTECTED FAMILY LEAVE. THIS CAN CREATE AN UNNECESSARY HURDLE FOR UTILIZING THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM WHICH YOU ARE PAYING INTO REGARDLESS. SO -- THIS BILL WOULD SHORTEN THE TENURE REQUIREMENT FOR JOB PROTECTION TO SIX MONTHS STILL HAVE PAYING INTO THE SYSTEM BUT LESSEN THAT TEN YEAR TIME TO SIX MONTHS. IT WOULD AGAIN BRING CALIFORNIA IN LINE WITH NEW YORK'S FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM WHICH ALSO HAS A SIX MONTH WORK TENURE PROGRAM REQUIREMENT AND SAN FRANCISCO'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE ORDINANCE. WHICH HAS A WORK TENURE REQUIREMENT OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO EXPAND FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO WHO CAN TAKE BABY BONDING LEAVE TO ENSURE THAT MORE INFANTS GET THEIR STRONGEST DEVELOPMENTAL START WITH INDIVIDUAL. AT HOME CARE. NO BETTER PLACE FOR AN INFANT TO BE SENATE HOME BONDING WITH A LOVED. ONE IN FACT NOT ONLY IS IT A BETTER PLACE BUT WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE CARE FOR THE ALTERNATIVE THAT'S TRUE. CURRENTLY 35240% OF INFANTS IN CALIFORNIA AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS REALLY OF OF REALLY INTERESTING AND SOMEONE. THOUGHT PROVOKING NOTION THAT ARE BORN INTO SINGLE PARENT FAMILIES. THERE IS ONLY ONE PARENT THERE THE MOTHER. USUALLY TO CARE FOR THIS CHILD. IF WE HOPE FOR INFANTS TO ACHIEVE SIX MONTHS OF INDIVIDUAL CARE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY TO CARING ADULTS TAKING TREE MUCH EACH. ARE AS THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED WE HAVE TO EXPAND THE CIRCLE OF CARE GIVING TO ALLOW CARE BY A CARING ADULT. OTHER THAN A PARENT. IN THOSE CASES. SO ON TO OUR GRANDPARENTS WHO QUALIFIES FOR CIFRA AND DESIGNATES AN INFANT FOR THEIR CARE. THIS WOULD THIS BILL WOULD ALSO EXPAND PAID FAMILY LEAVE TO INCLUDE THIS DESIGNATED PERSON. I MEAN WE HAVE TO FACE FACTS THIS IS THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE. IT IS NOT FATHER KNOWS BEST IT IS NOT LEAVE IT TO BEAVER THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD IT'S THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE HAVE GOT TO START MAKING THE NECESSARY ACCOMMODATIONS. SO THAT WE CAN AS A SOCIETY CARE FOR OUR FAMILIES. THIS MEASURE ALSO EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY MEMBERS IN CIFRA FOR THE PURPOSE OF CARE GIVING FOR A SERIOUSLY ILL PERSON. TO INCLUDE A GRANDPARENT GRANDCHILD SIBLING PARENT IN LAW CHILD IN LAW WERE DESIGNATED PERSON TO ALLOW FOR DIVERSE CARE GIVING NEEDS AND MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILIES. WE ARE ALSO AN AGING POPULATION WHO IS GOING TO CARE FOR OUR SENIORS WHEN THEY START TO AGE AND NEED THAT KIND OF CARE WE HAVE INADEQUATE FACILITIES FOR THEM WHO IS GOING TO DO IT. AND HOW IS OUR ECONOMY GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE AND FLOURISH WHEN THERE'S NOBODY TO CARE FOR OUR LOVED ONES. MOST OF THESE FAMILY WERE MEMBERS ARE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM IN THIS WOULD SIMPLY ALIGN OUR JOB PROTECTION LAW. WITH ARE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. THIS PROVISION ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT FAMILIES TODAY ARE SMALLER THEY LIVE FARTHER APART AND ARE OFTEN ON CONVENTIONALLY ASSEMBLED. SOMETIMES LOVINGLY REFERRED TO IS BLENDED FAMILIES. AN AGING ADULTS RELY ON A WIDE NETWORK OF RELATIONSHIPS FOR CARE GIVING. BY ALLOWING CARE GIVING FOR A DESIGNATED PERSON THIS PROVISION ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THE MOST OBVIOUS CARE GIVER FOR A SERIOUSLY ILL PERSON. MAY BE A NON RELATED LOVED ONE A ROOMMATE OR A LONG TIME NEIGHBOR OR FRIEND. I SHOULD ADD THAT EXPANDING THE CIRCLE OF CARE GIVING TO EXTENDED A CHOSEN FAMILY IN THIS BILL IS NOT UNIQUE. PAID FAMILY LEAVE LAWS IN NEW YORK. COVER CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LEGALLY FORMALIZED. IN EIGHT LOCALITIES IN THE STATES OF ARIZONA RHODE ISLAND AND NEW JERSEY HAVE PASS PAID SICK TIME LAWS THAT ALSO COVER CHOSEN AND EXTENDED FAMILY. IN ADDITION EFFORTS ARE NOW UNDERWAY IN PLACES LIKE RHODE ISLAND. TO EXPAND THE FAMILY DEFINITION IN THEIR PAID FAMILY LEAVE LAWS WE ARE NOT THE FIRST YEAR. WE ARE NOT OUT AHEAD WE ARE FOLLOWING. OUR AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT A AS A STATUS LARGEST WE ARE THAT WE SEND THAT STRONG MESSAGE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THIS IS THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FAMILIES ARE DIFFERENT OUR NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT. AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A SOCIETY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. SO IN FINALLY. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW CIFRA. WITH EXPANSIVE FOR I SHOULD SAY TO ALLOW JOB PROTECTED TIME OFF TO CARE FOR NEEDS THAT ARISE WHEN AN EMPLOYEE SPOUSE DOMESTIC PARTNER. PARTNER OR CHILD IS DEPLOYED OVERSEAS AS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES THIS EXTENDS JOB PROTECTION FOR POPULATION THAT WAS RECENTLY CHEST INCLUDEDIN OUR PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. AS A RESULT OF LEGISLATION I DID LAST YEAR. WE NEED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS WE NEED TO CLARIFY IT MAKE IT MORE CONSISTENT SO THE PEOPLE BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES UNDERSTAND. WHAT WE EXPECT OF THEM WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO TAKE AND IN DOING SO WE CAN FURTHER ADVANCE? ECONOMY OUR SOCIETY AND MAKE THIS PLACE A STRONGER BETTER PLACE FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES AND OUR LOVED ONES WITH THAT. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE ERIN CABLE WITH FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA AND JULIA PARISH WITH THE LEGAL AID AT WORK WHO WILL SPEAK MORE ABOUT THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS CABLE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AARON GABLE FROM FIRST LIVE CALIFORNIA YOUR STATE COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD. SPOKEN CHAMPION FOR YOUNG CHILDREN SO I WILL KEEP THIS BRIEF THANK OUT RESEARCH OUT OF HARVARD THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AND MANY OTHERS. HAVE HAVE PROVEN A STARTLING YET SIMPLE CONCLUSION. NURTURING INTERACTIONS HELP BUILD CONNECTIONS IN A BABY'S BRAIN THAT IMPACT THAT CHILD'S LIFE FOREVER. QUALITY INTERACTIONS QUALITY BONDING IN THE FIRST MONTHS AND YEARS OF A CHILD'S LIFE RESULT IN LARGER VOCABULARY. MORE DEVELOP SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SKILLS BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES BETTER EDUCATION OUTCOMES AND EVEN MORE SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL FUTURE FOR THAT CHILD. BUT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS BRAIN SCIENCE MEANS NOTHING IF PARENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE ACTION TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN. DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE BASIC LIMITED LEAVE AFTER THE BIRTH OF THEIR CHILD AND SPEND THOSE FIRST KEY MONTHS NURTURING AND INTERACTING WITH THEIR CHILD. KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS BRAIN SCIENCE MEANS NOTHING. FAMILY LEAVE IS NOT A LUXURY FOR A PARENT IS A BIOLOGICAL NECESSITY FOR EVERY CHILD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN MINOR SHORT TERM INCONVENIENCE FOR EMPLOYERS AND LONG TERM LIFELONG BENEFITS FOR A CHILD. CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN NEED TO WIN THE DEBATE. AND WHILE SB ONE THIRTY FIVE MAY NOT SEEM TO BE ABOUT. WALLY CHILD CARE IN OUR CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS A SENATOR INDICATED PARENTS LACK OF ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY CARE FOR THEIR BABIES. IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT FOR AND A NECESSITY IN LOOKING AT HOW WE NEED TO PROTECT FAMILY LEAVE IN FACT THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS IS NOT RECOMMEND. THE CHILD RECEIVE ANY KIND OF OUT OF HOME CARE UNTIL THEY ARE AT LEAST THREE MONTHS OF AGE FOR MEDICAL REASONS. INCREASED QUALITY AND LENGTH OF PARENTAL LEAVE IS AN INVESTMENT IN EARLY LEARNING WITHOUT GENERAL FUND AND PACKED AND IS A TWO GENERATION IMPACT TO COMBAT POVERTY. AND TO INCREASE THE LIFELONG POTENTIAL OF ALL OF OUR CHILDREN ON BEHALF OF FIRST FIVE ACROSS CALIFORNIA I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION WHICH IS A VERY PRUDENT NEXT UP. TO CHEESE ACHIEVING EQUITABLE ACCESS FOR OUR CHILDREN TO EXISTING LEAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS JULIA PARISH I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK WHICH IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF LOW WAGE WORKERS AND WHEN I THINK. AND TEAR PERSON MITCHELL AND SENATE JACKSON FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE HAS MADE FAMILIES. WORK PLACES AND CALIFORNIA STRONGER IT IS A LIFELINE FOR WORKING FAMILIES IN THOSE BRIEF BUT VERY INTENSE MOMENTS OF NEED EITHER THE BIRTH OF A NEW CHILD. OR DEALING WITH A SERIOUS ILLNESS OFA FAMILY MEMBER. THESE ARE MOMENTS THAT AS AND ASTABLE SEATED CAN CHANGE THE COURSES OF LIFE FOR EVER. BUT WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES IN OUR STATE ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND -- AND THAT IS THIS THAT THE FACT THAT WE SIMPLY MUST REMEDY -- OTHERWISE ARE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM A PROGRAM THAT'S DESIGNED TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND EQUITY WILL ACTUALLY EXACERBATE INEQUITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY. FOR EXAMPLE LOW INCOME WORKERS AND LOW QUALITY JOBS -- AMONG THOSE WHO ARE AWARE OF THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM 37% NOW ELECTED NOT TO USE THE BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES AT WORK. AND WE KNOW THAT -- A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE FUND BUT NOT ABLE TO DRAW DOWN THE BENEFITS SO FOR EXAMPLE -- AMONG WORKERS EARNING TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR LESS THEY ACTUALLY COMPRISE 40%. OF CONTRIBUTING WORKERS TO THE FUNDS BUT ONLY 24% OF ACTUAL CLAIMANTS THERE'S THAT MEANS THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE SUBSIDIZING THIS FUND. FOR HIGHER EARNERS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING THE EQUITY. AND AVAILABILITY OF THIS -- REALLY IMPACTFUL LIFE ALTERING BENEFITS FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST IN CALIFORNIA. I'M NOT TO MENTION THAT HAS -- A REALLY POSITIVE IN. FORTY AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN A FATHER FOR EXAMPLE IS ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE -- AND BE WITH THE NEW CHILD IT -- ALTERS THE CARE GIVING RELATIONSHIP FOR THROUGH OUT THAT CHILD'S LIFE -- BASED ON JUST THOSE FIRST MOMENTS AND WITHOUT JOB PROTECTION -- DAD'S AS CENTERED ACTION POINTED OUT ENTITLED TO A SINGLE JOB PROTECT pAND AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE MOMENTS THAT WE HAVE A SOLUTION THAT WE KNOW CAN IMPACT A MORE POSITIVE OUTCOME RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AND WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN -- THE OTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT IS THAT -- MOTHERS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE WORK FORCE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR JOBS SO THAT THEY'RE NOT ALTERNATELY LEFT WITH HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. PROVIDING FOR THE FAMILY AGAIN DURING THESE BRIEF MOMENTS OF TIME THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY -- TO PREVENT DERAILMENTS -- OF AND THE SNOWBALLING NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A FAMILY WHEN THAT WHEN -- FACE WITH THOSE REALLY DIFFICULT CHOICES. THIS BILL ALIGNS THE JOB PROTECTION ELEMENTS WITH THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS. SO THE FOLKS WHO ARE PAYING FOR THE BENEFIT CAN TAKE IT WHEN THEY NEED IT -- AND RIGHT NOW THE CALIFORNIA JOB PROTECTION LAWS ARE SIMPLY AN ADEQUATE AND IT IS HARMING WORKING FAMILIES -- OVER FIVE MILLION EMPLOYEES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THESE DROP PROTECTION BENEFITS AND FOR THOSE REASONS HIGHER INTEREST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL ASK OTHERS IN SUPPORT TO PLEASE LINE UP NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL PLEASE.

MICHELLE DUGGAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE HAVE A SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE SEFER EXPANSION AND BELIEVE THAT THE ABOUT EMPLOYER SIZE THRESHOLD AND THE OUR THRESHOLD -- ON REASONABLE AND SHOULD BE EXPANDED AS OUTLINED IN THIS BILL. WE ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE OUTCOME ENVISIONED BY THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE EXPANSION BUT WE HOPE TO HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE FUND THAT AND FIND MECHANISM OTHER THAN. PUTTING THE COST ON WORKERS SUCH AS OF A SUCH AS AN EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION OR OTHER MEANS THANKS. EXACTLY THE WILL YOU BE PREPARED IN YOUR CLOSING TO ADDRESS. THAT ISSUE YEAH I I COULD DO IT NOW FROM HIS LIPS TO GOD'S EARS RIGHT -- THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE BILL -- LISTEN BY THE OPPOSITION TO COME FORWARD. WITH MY MAKING THE MUCH FAITH. WELL LOOK OF THE IRANIAN YEAH. WELL ALL RIGHT. HI GOOD MORNING LOWER CURTIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST START OFF BY NOTING THAT CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT. IS NOT LIMITED TO BE BONDING SO THIS BILL EXPANDS NOT ONLY THE BABY FUNDING PROVISION BUT ESSENTIALLY AM ANY A SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITION FOR YOURSELF OR AN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER. AND OVERALL OUR CNCERNS IS THAT THIS IT LOWERS THE THRESHOLD FOR WHAT IS CONSIDERED -- FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT LEAVE MEANING THAT IT'S NO LONGER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FMLA THE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT AND SO THEY DO NOT RUN CONCURRENTLY IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS AN EMPLOYEE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE SET FOR LEAVE. AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY TAKE FMLA LEAVE AND SORE CONCERNED ESPECIALLY WITH THE THRESHOLD THEN BEING LOWERED TO EMPLOYERS WITH FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES. THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SMALL EMPLOYERS THAT ONLY HAVE LET'S SAY FIVE EMPLOYEES AND TWO OF THEM ARE OUT ON SET FOR LEAVE IN A THIRTY TO TAKES IT FROM THE SO IN THOSE KINDS AS CIRCUMSTANCES THE EMPLOYER HAS NO DISCRETION AS TO WHO CAN TAKE LEAVE HOW LONG. THEY CAN BE OUT FOR AS LONG AS IT'S FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS AND THE SOME AMOUNT CAN BE TAKEN INTERMITTENTLY WHICH MEANS AND THE EMPLOYER STUCK WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO CAN COVER FOR THIS LEAVE WHILE EMPLOYEES ARE OUT AT DIFFERENT TIMES FOR DIFFERENT LINKS. SO OVERALL OUR CONCERN WITH THAT IS THAT THE BURDEN THIS IS GOING TO PLACE ON SMALL BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO THE FIFTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES THRESHOLD I YOU'RE NOW GOING TO HAVE EMPLOYEES TAKING SURFER LEAVE AS WELL AS FMLA. IF YOU ADD PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE ON TOP OF THAT THEN YOU HAVE FOUR MONTHS OF PROTECTED LEAVE FOR PREGNANCY DISABILITY. THAT MEANS FOR THE SMALL EMPLOYERS YOU'RE LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL OF SEVEN MONTHS LEAVE AND THEN FOR LARGER EMPLOYERS YOU'RE LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL OF TEN MONTHLY. AND THIS IS A HUGE BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS -- AND THAT'S WITH REGARD TO PREGNANCY BUT AS FAR AS FOR THE AND FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE INCLUDED. IN THE PREGNANCY A YOU'RE STILL LOOKING AT A A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON THESE EMPLOYERS AND SO OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT WHEN. THEY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO AMANDA FMLA -- TO MAKE THE IS LAWS A RUN CONCURRENTLY AND WE ALSO HAVE NO ABILITY TO TELL AN EMPLOYEE THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE FMLA LEAVE ONCE THEY QUALIFY FOR IT. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED AT THIS TIME AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED. THE MANAGER MEMBERS CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA BUILDS ASSOCIATION I JUST WANT TO ADD. TWO ADDITIONAL POINTS THE FIRST IS. THAT THE THE BILL ALLOWS ANY DESIGNATED PERSON TO QUALIFY NOT JUST IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS WHICH IS COVERED BY. FMLA SORE CONCERNED BY THAT. AND IN ADDITION ALTHOUGH IT'S OFTEN STATED THAT THIS IS NOT PAID FOR BY THE EMPLOYERS THERE ARE EMPLOYER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH. THE CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS FOR THOSE WHO ARE OUT ON LEAVE IF YOU'RE PAYING OVER TIME -- FOR ADDITIONAL WORK BY THE CURRENT WORK FORCE FOR YOUR PAYING TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES. AND OF COURSE WITH THE STATEMENT OF THE LABOR FEDERATION -- AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF VANTAGE POINT THANK YOU. FAITH BORDERS ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. THE PRINTER WOMEN THIRTY HIS TO THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF FOOD PRODUCERS ARE RETAINED THE PROCESSING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA -- IN ADDITION. GETTING ANSWER THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE ARE RESPECTFULLY POST. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] THANK PAN. I THANK YOU SENATE JACKSON -- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- A YELL. CERTAINLY IS A PEDIATRICIAN AS WELL AS A VAMPIRE TODAY APPRECIATE THE BENEFITS OF FAMILY LEAVE AND WE DOING -- I KNOW THAT WE SAT DOWN HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS AND YEAH I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE BURDEN ON SMALL BUSINESSES -- AND IT AND IN THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON THEM BECAUSE AND I KNOW YOU'VE HAD EXPERIENCE AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER -- SET SAID WHY -- YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL EXPENSES RELATED TO FOR EXAMPLE GETTING SOMEONE TO WORK TEMPORARILY SPECIALLY OF YOUR SMALL BUSINESS AND EVERYONE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PARTICULAR TASK OR OUR OUR PROFESSION -- LICENSE OR SOMETHING SO IT'S SO I THINK WHAT WHERE THINGS THAT AND I'M NOT ACTUALLY ACTUALLY ASKING FOR ANYTHING IN YOUR BILL TODAY BUT TERMS OF BROADER CONVERSATION. THINKING ABOUT SOME THINGS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO TO HELP OUT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE EXTRA EXPENSE THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH -- PLAY COMING OUT GOING ON LEAVE -- WHETHER WE SHOULD BE OUT BECAUSE TEMP WORKERS ARE GENERALLY MORE EXPENSIVE AND LESS EFFICIENT THAN. THE PERSON YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND SO AS GUESTS TO SIGN UP. FOR YOU KNOW WHATEVER SIX WEEKS TO MONTH JOB -- THERE -- WE ARE. AND MAKES SENSE REQUIRING HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE ON LEAVE AND THAT'S AN EXPENSE FOR SOMEONE WHO'S NOT ACTUALLY PRODUCING INCOME. AND AND AND THE OFFICE AND SO -- PERHAPS MAYBE YOU COULD JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON I REALIZED THAT I'M NOT ASKING FOR SOMETHING IN YOUR PARTICULAR BILL I THINK SOME THINGS ARE -- THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT IS WHETHER WE SHOULD MAYBE GIVE SOME KIND OF A SMALL BUSINESS TAX CREDIT. FOR FOR SOME EXTRA EXPENSES RELATED TO PEOPLE BE ONLY FOR SOME SORT OF OPTIONS WE CAN PROVIDE SOME RELIEF. TO SMALL BUSINESSES TO WHOM IT MAY BE HAVING MORE CHALLENGES WRESTLING WITH HAVING EMPLOYEES OUT EXTEND LEAD WHILE RECOGNIZING THERE'S A BET STRONG BENEFIT TO BOTH EMPLOYEES AND SOCIETY. TWO EIGHT BEAVER PRIDE LEADS TO THESE YEAH YOU WERE TALKING FIVE SIX PEOPLE BUSINESSES. SURE AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD IN HAVING HAD MY OWN SMALL BUSINESS I KNOW IT CAN BE CHALLENGING IN FACT EVEN HERE WHEN WE HAVE. STAFF THAT GOES ON LEAVE IN AND WHAT HAVE YOU THAT YOU KNOW WE ALL SORT OF KINSHIP. OF BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO GET A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY COME IN AND WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE IN MY OFFICE RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALL WAITING. TO TO MEET OUR NEW. FAMILY MEMBER OF A SO -- CERTAINLY IF IF THIS WERE TO CREATE PROBLEMS I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD CONSIDER -- BUT YOU KNOW WE KEEP HEARING OF THE SKY IS FALLING I MEAN THE CHAMBER PEOPLE HAVE TAKE SEVEN MONTHS TEN MONTHS I MEAN. IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS. I MISS MOST PEOPLE DON'T TAKE THE LEAVE. OR THEY DON'T TAKE THE FULL LEAVE BECAUSE IT'S NOT PAID YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO IT'S NOT PAID LEAVE. ARE YOU GET SIX WEEKS TO IT WERE YOU KNOW MAYBE SOMEDAY WE CAN PUSH IT TO TWELVE MAYBE SOMEDAY WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET SOME CONTRIBUTION FROM EMPLOYERS ARE. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS BUT I MEAN THIS IS YOU TAKING MONEY OUT OF YOUR OWN SAVINGS ACCOUNT. AND AS WE KNOW IN TODAY'S WORLD PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A HECK OF A LOT AND SAVINGS. SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE MORE LEAVE THEN THEY THEY NEED IF YOU WILL. TO TO CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES OF THEIR BONDING EXPERIENCES SO -- TO THE EXTENT THAT. YOU KNOW WE HEARD THIS WE HEARD ALL MY GOSH WE GONNA GET PEOPLE UP TO TWELVE WEEKS TO OF JOB PROTECTION TO THE BOND WITH NEWBORN TO CHECK FOR FOR GROUPS OF TWENTY OR OR MORE. YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A PROBLEM I THINK WE CAN DO WITH IT AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE PROBLEMS I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA HAPPEN -- TAKE A LOOK AT THE SO MANY OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD FROM CANADA FRANCE TO SCANDINAVIA. THEY GIVE A YEAR AND A HALF OF JOB PROTECTED USUALLY PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND THOSE COUNTRIES LAST I LOOKED -- DOING QUITE WELL -- SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM BUT IF IT WERE TO BE A PROBLEM I'D CERTAINLY BE VERY INTERESTED IN TRYING. TO TO TO FIGURE OUT A WAY PARTICULARLY WITH THE SMALLER COMPANY COMPANIES THAT OPERATE ON A VERY SMALL PROFIT MARGIN USUALLY -- BUT I DON'T WE'RE NOT THERE YET -- I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE A PROBLEM BUT IF IT IS CERTAINLY NOBODY WANTS TO LOSE THE BUSINESS IS WHAT WE WANT AD IN FACT. THE DATA SHOWS. THAT OF THE COMPANIES ACTUALLY BENEFIT WHEN THEY PROVIDE THIS LEAF THE EMPLOYEES ARE LONGER STANDING. THEY'RE MORE LOYAL I YOU DON'T HAVE TO TURN OVER BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY IT IS THAT PEOPLE WILL LEAVE. THEY HAVE NO WHO WE CAN DO LEAVE YOUR CHEAT LEVER TO MONTH HOLE ALL OF ALONE. I GO BACK TO WORK YOU QUIT YOUR JOB AND SO THEN THE EMPLOYER HAS TO FIND NEW PEOPLE AND THE COST OF TRAINING. IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO -- ECONOMICALLY AND AND WHAT HAVE YOU I THINK THIS IS A REAL WIN WIN IF IT TURNS OUT THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO TO ADJUST IT THEN BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE PROBLEMS YET WITH THE LEAVE THAT WE'VE GOT. THE FOUR MONTHS THE SEVEN MONTHS THAT TIME WITH THAT IT'S JUST IT JUST. NONEXISTENT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IF WE WERE TO SEE PROBLEMS THEN CERTAINLY I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD AND WOOD IS A PUBLIC POLICY BODY TAKE NECESSARY STEPS THAT POINT. THANK YOU I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED SENATOR JACKSON -- BECAUSE OF THE NOTE I MADE TO MYSELF IS THAT WE OFTEN -- IT OPPOSITION TO POLICY SUCH AS THIS IT IT RARELY DO WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE QUANTIFIABLE VALUE BOTH ECONOMIC AND IN TERMS OF A HEALTHY CORPORATE CULTURE THE VALUE OF HAVING THESE KINDS OF POLICIES -- AND WHEN I LISTEN -- TO THE SEVEN MONTH EXAMPLE YOU KNOW I I THOUGHT ABOUT MY OWN LIFE EXPERIENCES WE OFTEN DO AS POLICY MAKERS -- AND IN THAT I AM AN ADOPTIVE PARENT THE PREGNANCY RELATED DISABILITY -- DIDN'T APPLY TO ME AND SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE SO MANY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE THAT HAVE TO COME INTO PLAY. I APPRECIATE YOUR BILL THE FACT THAT YOU ARE ON THAT KNOWLEDGE IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESSES IN OUR STATE WHICH ARE SMALL BUSINESSES -- AND WE ARE TAKING STE. ALL AOUND A VARIETY OF WORKPLACE POLICIES TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL BUSINESSES AND ALL EMPLOYEES AS MANY AS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE STATE -- DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT. YEAH THE FRUSTRATING THING FOR ME AND I JUST CAN'T HELP MYSELF SENATOR. IS FINALLY HERE -- THE THE THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THE EQUATION LINE UP IN OPPOSITION -- HEY THAT WE OFTEN DON'T SEE THOSE SAME PLAYERS LINE UP. IN SUPPORT OF RESOURCES AND SERVICES THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. LIKE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION WE WORKED VERY HARD. THE TWO OF US IN PARTNERSHIP TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE. ARE ADDITIONAL CHILDCARE SLOTS AVAILABLE AND THAT WE TRY TO MAKE CHILD CARE HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE. AND A VARIETY OF CHILD CARE OPTIONS SO WHATEVER YOUR EMPLOYMENT MAY BE WHERE THE WORK. EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS I'M TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES WHO NEED PEOPLE AVAILABLE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS WEEKENDS AND EVENINGS AND SO I WISH WE COULD FORM A PARTNERSHIP WITH FOLKS WOULD LINE UP. TO MAKE SURE SAYS WE'RE NOT GONNA PROVIDE FAMILY LEAVE. THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THOSE OTHER RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEIR VALUED EMPLOYEES. WITHOUT ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENATE JACKSON TO LIKE ABOUT A LOT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION I FEEL FOR A WHILE THERE THAT I WAS. SIR TALKING WITH THE CHOIR. BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE AND YOU KNOW IF WE LAUNCH THE FIRST PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. IT'S BEEN THAT LONG. SO AND WE CAN NO LONGER CLAIM TO BE IN THE LEAD ON THIS ISSUE. IN THE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND YOU KNOW AS YOU MENTION THE OPPOSITION LIKES TO PAINT THIS BILL IS EXPENSIVE BUT IN FACT. WE ARE IN MOST CASES JUST TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH OTHER STATES AND NOWHERE NEAR CATCHING UP WITH. MANY OF THE FIRST WORLD NATIONS THAT I MENTIONED. ARE REALITY TODAY IS WE HAVE MORE TWO INCOME FAMILIES AND EVER BEFORE. THAT'S OUR REALITY IN. MOTHERS THE SOLE OR PRIMARY BREADWINNER THAT'S A REALITY. FATHERS ARE INCREASINGLY TAKING ON MORE CHILDCARE RESPONSIBILITIES AND I THINK THAT IS WONDERFUL. AND APPROPRIATE. AND NECESSARY. CALIFORNIA HAS AN AGING POPULATION WERE FAMILY CARE GIVING MAKES A VITAL DIFFERENCE. SO OUR LAWS NEED TO REFLECT ARE CHANGING REALITY. IF WE HOPE TO CREATE THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE START FOR OUR YOUNG CHILDREN. TAKE CARE OF OUR BELOVED FAMILY MEMBERS AND OUR AGING POPULATION AND KEEP OUR ECONOMY STRONG. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WORKS TOWARD AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OF THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY. DOCTOR PAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR HILL. MORRELL NOW MORAL NOTE JACKSON HI. MY MITCHELL AYE MITCHELL AYE. PAM I THOUGHT CENTER JACKSON MY NOTES SAY SINCE THE CHAIR IS ABSENT -- THAT HE WAS GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT HE HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES I THINK INCLUDED. IN YOUR LANGUAGE AND HE WON IT -- TO TALK. HOPING THAT TO WORK WILL BE DONE BEFORE THE BILL HITS THE SENATE FLOOR SO I WOULD JUST IF YOU WEREN'T AWARE THAT ALERT YOU TO THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT YOU'RE AT THE UP TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT IT. THANK YOU AND I THINK THAT THOSE CONCERNS WERE REFLECTED BY DR AMAZON WILL WEAR THEM AND AND CERTAINLY -- THEY'RE WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION -- AGAIN IF WE SEE THIS IS A PROBLEM. OF IT I I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO TO TAKE STEPS I I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHETHER IT IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE AGAIN. REMEMBERING THE PEOPLE ARE. PROBABLY NOT GONNA TAKE MUCH OF THAT TIME PARTICULARLY IN THE SMALL BUSINESS. I WOULD SUSPECT THAT MANY SMALL BUSINESSES WILL TRY TO MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS SO THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES. ARE ABLE TO WORK TO THE EXTENT THEY CAN'T EVEN IF IT'S PART TIME MEAN VALUED EMPLOYEES ARE VALUED EMPLOYEES AND WE WANT TO KEEP THEM. I WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH WITH THE THOSE WHO HAVE THAT CONCERN AND AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DISCUSSION AND HAVE ON OF CONVERSATION BUT WHO CAN AFFORD TO BE HOME WITH THE NEW BABY WHO COST YOU BY THE MINUTE. YOU. NO RESENTMENT THERE ACTUALLY ACTUALLY I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT -- WE ACTUALLY WANT TO SEE MORE PEOPLE TAKE A LEAVE SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE WE CAN HAVE THE BENEFITS OF THAT SO HOPEFULLY WITH MORE SUPPORT. THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO HAPPEN GREAT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO FOR THE RECORD THE STATE OF THE CONCERNS OF THE CHAIRS DOCTOR PAN. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM YOU SB THREE SIX THREE WORKPLACE SAFETY. AND I'M GO ASK FOR SOME OVERTIME PAY BECAUSE I DON'T CARE THIS COMMITTEE. I GOT A COMMITTEE I TEAR AND IS NOT LABOR. RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT. PROCEED TO EXPAND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. TEACHER MEMBERS -- SP THREE SIXTY THREE WERE REQUIRED ATA REPORTING FOR ASSAULTS BY INMATES ON PATIENTS. ARE PAID BY INMATES OR PATIENTS ON STAFF AT FACILITIES RUN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE% HOSPITALS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND THE DOCUMENTED INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE. PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR WORKPLACE VIOLENCE PREVENTION. HOWEVER AGGREGATE DATA REGARDING ASSAULTS OF STATE EMPLOYEES AND OUR MOST CHALLENGING AND VIOLENCE STATE WORK SITES. IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. IN ORDER TO INCREASE AND ENSURE SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES AT THESE FACILITIES WE NEED A CONFERENCE OF ASSESSMENT OF WHERE VIOLENT INCIDENTS ARE HAPPENING. HOW OFTEN AND WHICH EMPLOYEES THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE STATE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHOULD BE PROVIDED DATA REPORTS ON A MONTHLY AND ANNUAL BASIS? RESPECTIVELY TO MONITOR THE CURRENTS OF VIOLENT INCIDENTS INVOLVING STATE EMPLOYEES THE DATA WOULD INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES AT EACH FACILITY JOB CLASSIFICATION PLEASE ASSAULTED BY A PATIENT OR INMATE. AND THE DATE OF THE ASSAULT BY SHARING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN RESPECTIVE CHAIRS OF THE BUDGET. OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEES RECEIVE THE SUPPORT ANNUALLY THIS LEGISLATION TAKES A LOGICAL STEP IN MITIGATING. STAFF ASSAULT INTERSTATE FACILITIES BY UTILIZING THE LEGISLATURE'S OVERSIGHT ROLES TO COLLECT DATA THAT COULD BE USED TO EXPLORE FUTURE POLICIES ARE REGULATIONS THAT PROMOTE A SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR BOTH STAFF. AND PATIENTS ARE INMATES. I WOULD MAKE NOTE CERTAINLY IN PUBLIC HEALTH DATA IS THE FIRST STEP TO MAKING CHANGES TO MAKE HELP KEEP PEOPLE SAFER I'M PLEASED TO HAVE WITH ME TODAY A BILL JOHNSON THE CHAPLAIN AT VALLEY STATE PRISON. AND COOLING A STATE HOSPITAL AND THE DOCTOR HEALY WILLIAMS A FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST THAT'S A COLLEGES SORRY. THAT THAT PSYCHOLOGIST A CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SACRAMENTO TO SHARE THEIR SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. HI MY NAME'S HAYLEY WILLIAMS -- I'M HERE IS ON THE LOCAL MEMBER OF ASKING TWENTY SIX TWENTY AND AS I WAS STATE I'M OF SENATE STAFF PSYCHOLOGIST AT CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SACRAMENTO -- IT'S PRETTY NATURAL OF THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO ME STAFF SAFETY IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME -- STAFF AT THE PRISONS ESPECIALLY WHERE I WORK ARE SOLD AT AN ALARMING RATE DALY -- WHETHER THAT BE SEXUALLY VERBALLY PHYSICALLY -- IT HAPPENS MUCH MORE THAN PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY AWARE OF IN PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THIS DATA ISN'T TRACT -- IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT READILY AVAILABLE FOR EVERYBODY. AND BY DOING SO BY HAVING A TRACK AND HAVING IT AVAILABLE NOT ONLY ARE WE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON IN THESE PRISONS BUT ALSO ALLOWING US TO HOPEFULLY DEVELOP A PATTERN. WHICH AS WE KNOW HISTORY HAS A TENDENCY TO REPEAT ITSELF AND WE CAN USE THOSE PATTERNS TO HOPEFULLY PREDICT FUTURE BEHAVIOR AND PREVENT FUTURE ASSAULTS ON STAFF -- ONE REASONS I WAS ASKED TO COME HERE TODAY IS THAT I HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED -- ABOUT A YEAR AGO I WAS -- TREATING SOMEONE I NEVER MET BEFORE. I WALKED INTO A ROOM AND BEFORE I COULD EVEN. REALLY GET IN THE ROOM I'M HE THREW A LARGE CUP OF YOUR IN MY FACE AYE AYES MOUTH -- AND DRENCH ME MY ENTIRE -- UPPER HALF MY BODY HAD TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT AND NOT ONLY IS THAT SHOCKING TO HAPPEN AT WORK ON THERE HAVE BEEN SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WERE IN PLACE SENSE THEN BUT IT IN FRONT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN BE KIND OF EMBARRASSING. AT A HOSPITAL -- EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT IT AND YOUR LITTLE AREA -- HOWEVER THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY KNOWN. ACROSS THE STATE SO WHEN THAT AND MAY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE -- NOT EVERYONE SO WE KNOWS THE HISTORY BEHIND THAT. SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A WAY TO TRACK THIS DATA SO THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT -- THE TRANSPARENCY AND I DID AS WELL AND SO THAT WE ALL HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THESE INSTITUTIONS. THANK YOU AND YOU ARE NOT A BILL NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

OUR DOCTOR PET DOCTOR PAN AND A DOCTOR WILLIAMS -- THIS IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE STATE LEVEL -- THE LEGISLATURE AS A KEY OVERSIGHT FUNCTION. AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE LEGISLATURE'S -- CURFEW -- RIGHT IF YOU WILL -- TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION HAVEN'T REALLY AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN ADEQUATELY ENSURE THAT AS WE MOVE FOR WHAT WE ARE CRAFTING POLICIES TO HELP. REDUCE VIOLENCE IN THIS IS IN OUR WORKPLACE PARTICULAR IN OUR OUR OF THE STATE FACILITIES -- I WOULD ADD THAT -- A A LOCAL FATHER BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO US -- LOCAL TWENTY SIX TWENTY OUR STATE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN OUR FACILITIES. OUR STATE FACILITIES -- BROUGHT THIS ISSUE FOR BECAUSE OF AN INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL FACILITY A COUPLE YEARS AGO A SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD. A CLINICIAN WAS ASSAULTED -- AND RAPED BY -- A PATIENT -- THIS ISSUE WAS ACTUALLY RESOLVED BY A NUMBER OF OTHER INMATES -- KIND OF JUMP IN ON THE ASSAILANT AND WRESTLING THEM DOWN THE PERSON. WHO WHO WAS ASSAULTED VICTIM SOUGHT MEDICAL CARE -- BUT WE FOUND OUT ANECDOTALLY ABOUT.

THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS SIMPLE TO ENSURE. THAT MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES WHO -- MORE MORE FREQUENTLY OR PERFORMING THEIR SERVICES NOT TO THINK FOR ANY -- BY OR TRAVELING ALL OVER TO PERFORM THEIR SERVICES. ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PAYING INTO THE STATE DISABILITY FIND AND THEN. ABLE -- TO ACCESS BENEFITS UNDER THE FIND DISABILITY BENEFITS ARE PAID FAMILY LEAVE -- AND SO FORTH RIGHT NOW -- BECAUSE THESE -- OF A LACK OF CLARITY -- IN THIS -- BECAUSE STATUTE WHICH IS CRAFTED IN YOUR WHEN WHEN MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTION BOYS ARE REALLY DOING THEIR WORK THEIR WORK FOR ONE STUDIO THEY'RE DOING ALL THE WORK IN CALIFORNIA.

VERY GOOD THANK YOU AGREEMENT WITH ME TODAY A REBEKAH RIND -- THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL CINEMATOGRAPHERS GUILD LOCAL SIX HUNDRED M. INSPIRED FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON I THINK IT IS GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIRMAN HELEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS FOR BACK CARINE AND I'M THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL CINEMATOGRAPHERS GUILD. IATSE LOCAL. SIX HUNDRED THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY ON BEHALF OF KEPT OF THE CALIFORNIA I OUGHT TO COUNSEL AND THE ENTERTAINMENT UNION COALITION. WHOSE MEMBERS ARE THE CIC THE LABORERS LOCAL SEVEN TWENTY FOUR THE TEAMSTERS LOCAL THREE NINETY NINE AND THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD DASH AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TELEVISION AND RADIO ARTISTS. COMBINED WE REPRESENT CLOSE TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND WOMEN AND MEN WORKING IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I AM HERE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB. TWO SEVEN ONE SB TWO SEVEN ONE IS NARROWLY WRITTEN TO ADDRESS A VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM OUR MEMBERS FACE BECAUSE OF HOW EMPLOYMENT PATTERNS IN OUR INDUSTRY. HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YEARS. WOMEN AND MEN WORKING IN THE FILM TELEVISION AND NEW MEDIA PRODUCTION MOVE FROM PRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION AN EMPLOYER TO EMPLOYER IN MULTIPLE STATES AND OFTEN BETWEEN MULTIPLE STATES ON A SINGLE PRODUCTION. THE RULES FOR DETERMINING WHERE EMPLOYMENT TAXES ON OUR WAGES ARE PAID. AND WHICH STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING BENEFITS ARE HALF CENTURY OLD AS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AND ARE DIFFICULT TO CLEARLY APPLY TO OUR INDUSTRY. THIS HAS LED TO A INCONSISTENT RESULTS BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS CONFUSION FOR WORKING FAMILIES ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE DISPUTES OVER THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF BENEFITS OR EVEN WHETHER THEY ARE. ABLE TO ACCESS ANY STATE BENEFITS AT ALL. AS YOU ALL KNOW PEOPLE USUALLY NEED THE COVERAGE THESE BENEFITS PROVIDE MOST AT TIMES OF OF EXTREME STRESS WHEN THEY'RE CERTAINLY -- UNEXPECTEDLY OUT OF WORK WHEN THEY'RE DISABLED AS A RESULT OF AN INJURY OR ILLNESS OR WHEN THEY NEED. OUR WHEN THEY NEED TIME OFF PAID FAMILY LEAVE WHEN THEY MUST TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CARE. OF FAMILY MEMBERS. IT IS THE WORST TIME TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT AND FIX YA EMPLOYMENT TAXES. AND DISABILITY CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE BEEN CREDITED TO THE WRONG STATE OR NOT CREDITED AT ALL. SB TWO SEVEN ONE SIMPLY CLARIFIES THE RULES SO THAT EMPLOYMENT TAXES AND DISABILITY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO THE STATE. WHERE OUR MEMBERS LIVE AND THEREFORE ARE MOST LIKELY TO CLAIM BENEFITS THE STATE WHERE THEY RESIDE? I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK SENATOR WIENER FREE SUPPORT. AND RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT SO MANY OF THE BILLS BEFORE YOU TODAY SEEK TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE CRITICAL SAFETY NET BENEFITS DESIGNED. FOR WORKING FAMILIES PUBLIC POLICY THAT WORKS FOR WORKING FAMILIES IS SOMETHING ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE PROUD OF THANK YOU AGAIN AND I URGE A YES VOTE ON SB TWO SEVEN ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY [inaudible] GOOD APP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. AS WAS MENTIONED THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY HAS KIND OF IN RECENT YEARS OF ALL THE WAY FROM THE ONE THAT WAS THAT THE D. I. N. PFL PROGRAMS WERE CREATED. FOR IT WOULD CREATE A KIND OF A UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE -- IN MANY CASES WORKERS DO QUALIFY FOR THESE PROGRAMS BUT BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE WORK IS OUT OF STATE. AND THERE'S THIS LACK OF CLARITY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT EMPLOYER SHOULD BE PAYING IT WHEN THEY ARE OUT OF STATE. IS STILL QUALIFY BUT THE BENEFITS ARE SO LOW THAT THE WORKERS DON'T HAVE MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO IT. I WE TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT ACCESS TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND ONE OF THE MAIN BARRIERS IS THAT WHEN BENEFITS ARE TOO LOW. WORKERS LOOK AT THAT AGE TO SIDE I CAN'T LIVE ON THAT AND SO THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE PAYING. FOR AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF A ONE TWO PUNCH IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE WORKERS HAVE TO GO OUT OF STATE A LOT WHERE. THEY THEN ALSO DON'T HAVE TIME TO BOND WITH CHILDREN IF THEY HAVE KIDS OR TAKE CARE OF A LOVED ONE IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ALREADY BY DEFINITION HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME OUT OF STATE. AND SO IT'S PARTICULARLY UNFAIR TO LET THAT LACK OF CLARITY CONTINUE IN THIS INDUSTRY AND WE THINK GIVEN THE NARROW APPLICATION. AND THE FACT OF THAT ON THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WORKERS PAY INTO THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO IT -- HOPEFULLY THE SOME OF THE COMMITTEE CAN CONSERVE CAN SUPPORT TODAY THAT HAVE A SHEET THAT OTHERS IN SUPPORT. WONDERFUL WE COULD DISTRICT CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT FOR THE TEAMSTERS AND SAG AFTER AND SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

KIND OF CARVE OUTS BUT WE HELD A TOWN HALL BUT THAT WAS WHEN I FIRST FULLY UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF KIND OF THE UNIQUE WORK CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INDUSTRY AND HOW WE NEEDED TO BE -- MINDFUL THAT AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT WE WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT MORE -- CRITICALLY BELOW THE LINEFOLKS IN THE INDUSTRY DO GET TO WORK IN STATE SO THEY ARE WITH THEIR FAMILIES WORKING VERY HARD TO DO THAT AFTER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS.

AND THEY WANT A VIBRANT FUTURE. THE SAME KIDS AND FAMILIES FEEL THAT THEY'RE PART OF A GRAND EXPERIMENT. THE INNOVATION ECONOMY IS ONE IN WHICH YOU'RE TESTING. DISRUPTING AND IN THE END FAILING OUR NEXT GENERATION. AND IT'S NOW TIME TO INNOVATE FOR CHANGE. AND I'D LIKE TO QUOTE. FROM THE VIC MERCY -- WHO SPOKE AT OUR CONFERENCE THREE WEEKS AGO? AS THE NINETEENTH SURGEON GENERAL UNITED STATES. IS NOT IT'S NO LONGER MORALLY ACCEPTABLE FOR TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO SAY WE JUST CREATE THE PLATFORMS. HOW PEOPLE USE THEM IS UP TO THEM? THAT IS MORALLY INDEFENSIBLE. IT IS A COP OUT AND IT IS HURTING CHILDREN. AND ADULTS THE SIDE IT LARGE. THE NATION'S DOCTORS FOR FOUR YEARS WHO CHALLENGE THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT TO TURN THE TIDE ON THE OPIOID CRISIS THEN CONTINUED ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS ASK OURSELVES WHAT THE IMPACT OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES? ARE ON ON THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO SERVE. PART OF THAT INVOLVES UNDERSTANDING AND INVESTING IN THAT IMPACT AND THE COURAGE TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION IF WE SEE THERE MAY BE NEGATIVE IMPACTS. EVEN IF THAT IMPACTS OUR PROFIT. WE HAVE TO FUNCTION WITHIN AT THAT THAT PEOPLE AND THEIR WELL BEING COME FIRST AND GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A ROLE. BY CONVENING THE RIGHT PLAYERS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. PLACING THIS HIGH INTERNATIONAL AGENDA. CALIFORNIA WITH THIS TECH EQUITY ACT IS DOING JUST THAT. PLACING THE ISSUE OF HOW TACK IMPACTS SOCIETY HI ON OUR NATIONAL AGENDA. PRIVACY IS ONLY BEGINNING DON'T ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION WHEN IT COMES TO RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AROUND TECHNOLOGY USE. JUSTICE AND IMPACT AND ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY WHILE CRITICAL. IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF EQUITY FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THROUGH THE TECH EQUITY ACT WE HOPE TO EXPLORE TAX IMPACT ON INEQUALITY ON CHANGES WERE WORKFORCE. THE FUTURE OF A FREE PRESS. AND TAX IMPACT ON OUR DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL CAPITAL. THIS WORK WILL ONLY HAPPEN BY ENGAGING COMMUNITIES AND SECTORS MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE. AND WITH THE MOST AT STAKE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO REALIZE JUST AND EQUITABLE TECH FEATURES FOR ALL. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO ONE CLEAR BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THING. THIS SENATOR JACKSON'S THANK YOU I I APPRECIATE THE THE EFFORT. THE IDEA BEHIND THIS AND I KNOW IS. CENTER STERN -- SO I HAVE A REAL ISSUE. WITH THE TECH WORLD IN THE WHOLE AREA OF PRIVACY. AND AS I BRED THIS BILL PRIVACY IS MENTIONED. BUT THE IDEA IT'S MY HOPE THAT THE IS THE BILL GOES FORWARD WE HAVE RIVACY ADVOCATES INCLUDED AYE. I DIDN'T SEE THAT HERE. IT SAYS MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION SHALL BE INDIVIDUALS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF AND EXPERTISE IN WORK WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT LABOR SO RIGHTS TECHNOLOGY IN PRIVACY WHETHER BY EXPERIENCE OR TRAINING. WE KNOW THE TECH WORLD. HAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF FIRE POWER ENORMOUS WEALTH. THAT -- THE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPACT -- DECISION MAKING BOTH IN WASHINGTON AND HERE IN THE CAPITAL. AND MY CONCERN IS THAT THE THE VOLUNTEERING OF THEIR WORK FORCE. TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEIR INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED OVER THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC AND AS YOU SAY MORALLY THAT THAT THE THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE SEEN BY THE TECH WORLD UP TO NOW HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY -- UNSUPPORTABLE. THE AT THE IMPACT ON OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS PRIVACY RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS. I I I I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT I WOULD LIKE SOME ASSURANCES IF LIKE IF I COULD. RECEIVE FROM. FROM YOU SENATOR STERN. OF BECAUSE PRIVACY SHE IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. IT ISN'T JUST A RITE OF X. Y. AND SEE IT IS. LISTED IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE AMONG. THE FUNDAMENTALRIGHTS OF LIFE LIBERTY PROPERTY AND PRIVACY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO PUT THIS INTO THE CONSTITUTION IN ANTICIPATION OF JUST WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING. SO IT'S MY HOPE. THAT -- THAT IS. ISSUE BE. HIGHLIGHTED. IN THIS EFFORT I MEAN THIS IS A GOOD START AND I APPRECIATE YOUR BRING THE BILL AND I I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT. BUT I I REALLY. WOULD LIKE INSURANCES THAT THIS REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE -- THAT THAT THE INDUSTRY IS TAKEN SO LIGHTLY THAT. MAKING SURE THAT BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN A RIGHT TO PRIVACY FOR EXAMPLE I KEEP -- IS JUST TO ME CONTRARY. TO THE CERTAINLY THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER OF CALIFORNIA LOS NATIONALLY PRIVACY IS IMPLIED IN THE CONSTITUTION HERE CALIFORNIA IT'S EXPLICIT. AND THE THE LACK OF IT THE LACK OF CONCERN FOR THE EFFORT TO PUT OTHER RIGHTS FAR IN EXCESS OF IT THAT AREN'T EVEN RIGHTS AT ALL BUT JUST ECONOMIC DRIVERS -- I JUST I'D I'D LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT SENATOR BECAUSE YEAH YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BUT I I JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE. AS IT PERTAINS TO THIS LEGISLATION CENTER. THANK YOU -- YEAH WELL AWARE OF OF YOUR CONCERNS. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IT. EXTENSIVELY IN THE COMMITTEE IN JUDICIARY AS OF LATE. I I WASN'T ANTICIPATING THIS BEING THE VENUE TO HAVE THE THE DATA PRIVACY. CONVERSATION FRANKLY. I WAS TRYING TO TACKLE THE OTHER ISSUES AROUND. THE SOCIAL BENEFITS AND COSTS OF INNOVATION. I ACTUALLY AM VERY INTERESTED IN. TRYING TO PUT SOME KIND OF REAL REGULATORY DATA PROTECTION AGENCY IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS -- AND I THINK THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING MUCH MORE NEAR TERM THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING NOT A COMMISSION TO STUDY SOMETHING BUT I THINK WE ACTUALLY NEED. A DP A SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE IN EUROPE. TO ENFORCE THE GDP ARE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE YOU THAT THAT KIND OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORK SOON ENOUGH I KNOW YOU'VE GOT LEGISLATION PENDING IT TAKES A DIFFERENT APPROACH IS SORT OF MORE LITIGATION BASE FRAMEWORK -- THAT I'VE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT -- I I WOULD SAY I HAD I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. WHAT THE WITNESS TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF? KIND OF INCREDULOUS NOUS ABOUT THESE NUTRIENTS OSTENSIBLY NEUTRAL PLATFORMS THEY REALLY AREN'T -- SO THERE THERE NEEDS TO BE A SORT OF SHARED -- EQUITY STAKE IN THIS BUT YEAH I'M HAPPY TO CONSIDER HOW PRIVACY FITS IN. IT'S ALREADY MENTIONED AS ONE OF THE MANY TOPICS SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE YOU. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HERE -- BUT I WOULD LOVE I WOULD LOVE. TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING REAL WITH -- WITH WITH THE DATA PROTECTION AGENCY I MEAN IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AYE AYE I'M ALL OF THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER BILL BUT THIS BILL. WE'RE SETTING UP A COMMISSION WE'RE SETTING UP A AN ENTITY TO TRY TO FOCUS. ON THE ISSUE OF OF YOU KNOW ASSOCIATED WITH -- INTACT THE TECH WORLD SO FORTH I JUST. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY BECAUSE IT'S SO FUNDAMENTAL AND IT IT'S SO INTEGRATED INTO ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE TECH WORLD. THAT'S WHAT MY CONSUMING SO SO THE VISION FOR THIS IS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY WILL BE SOME KIND OF STUDY AND EXPERT -- EFFORT TO DO THE ACCOUNTING FOR WHAT THE VALUE OF OUR DATA IS WRIT LARGE -- AND WHAT WHAT THAT VALUE PROPOSITION LOOKS LIKE. WHICH I GUESS HAS SOME BEARING ON PRIVACY THE PRIVACY ISSUES MENTIONED HAPPY. TO FURTHER CONSIDER IT BUT YEAH I I I I THINK IT'S PRETTY EXPLICIT IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW THAT IT LISTS OUT THAT IS MEANT ONE OF PRIVACY WORK FORCE AND MEDIA AND PUBLISHING. DEMOCRACY COMPETITION INEQUALITY SO. I I I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO TO DO THAN. THAT BUT I'M HAPPY TO KEEP EXPLORING THAT WITH YOU -- IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD -- THANK YOU I MAY BE A REPRESENTATIVE FOR SOMETHING WITH EXPERTISE IN. DAY TO PROTECT.
