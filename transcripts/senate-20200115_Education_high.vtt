00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.511
OVER THIRTY ONE YEARS AGO. THAT

00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:40.980
THEY THINK THE BEST WAY. TO

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:41.547
GIVE PEOPLE NOTICES THROUGH

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:45.151
MAIL BUT YOU KNOW SINCE THE

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:46.385
LAST THIRTY ONE YEARS WE NOW

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:47.954
HAVE WE'VE BEEN ADVANCE IN

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.589
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SO MAYBE

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:51.824
THEY SHOULD COME UP TO SPEED

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:53.359
WITH THEIR BETTER BUSINESS

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.861
PRACTICES BOB AND SO WHAT

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:57.229
HAPPENS BECAUSE WE HAD EMAIL

00:09:57.296 --> 00:10:00.132
SALES TAX- WHATEVER YOU YOU

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:02.001
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CLEARLY

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.036
COMMUNICATE PERRANCE. AND SO

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.204
THAT WAS KIND OF A WEIRD THING

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.773
THEY SAID BUT WHAT IS WORSE

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.142
ABOUT THE STUDY THAT THEY SITE

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:11.844
FROM THE RAND INSTITUTE IS THE

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:15.181
SAMPLE SIZE WAS TO SEVENTH

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:19.385
GRADE CLASSES IN LA. SOMY-

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.519
STAFF DID RESEARCH AND WE FOUND

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:23.089
OUT THERE'S TEN THOUSAND. FIVE

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:24.090
HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE SCHOOLS

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:27.159
IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND BACK

00:10:27.226 --> 00:10:27.760
THIRTY ONE YEARS AGO THEY ONLY

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:31.063
SAMPLE TO. A CLASSROOM SO THAT

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.468
WAS THE ACLU'S LETTER AGAIN I

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:36.068
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING A

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.504
CASE. PHAM CONNECTS I'D LIKE TO

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:39.405
READ ONE AND THIS IS KIND OF A

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.606
SAD WHEN I'M I CAN READ THE

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:42.908
WHOLE THING. BUT I'M I'M VERY

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:48.514
DISAPPOINTED- I LOVE TEACHERS.

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:50.549
YOU KNOW THAT SEVEN YEARS IN

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:51.283
HIGH SCHOOL I GOT TO KNOW MY

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.586
TEACHERS PRETTY WELL- BUT THE

00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:55.621
FEDERAL CALIFORNIA FEDERATION

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:57.289
OF TEACHERS. SAN IN A LETTER

00:10:57.356 --> 00:11:00.092
OPPOSING TO AN AND THIS THIS

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.594
THIS IS PROBABLY MORE ON A

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.462
SERIOUS NOTE. BECAUSE WHAT THEY

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:06.032
SAY THEY SORT OF MAKE OUR CASE.

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.099
THIS OPPOSITION LEADER WARREN

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.835
OPPOSITION TO SAID SIX SEVENTY

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:11.070
THREE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE FOR A

00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:12.571
PUPIL IN ACTIVE PARENTAL

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:14.940
CONSENT. WITH A SIGNATURE. FOR

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:18.210
SEXUAL EDUCATION. SO THEY DON'T

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:19.211
WANT THE PARENTS TO SIGN IN IT

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:20.780
JUST KIND OF WHATEVER BUT IT

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.549
ALSO SAYS. THIS BILL REQUIRES A

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:24.950
SCHOOL DISTRICT TO MAKE THOSE

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.018
MATERIALS AVAILABLE FOR

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:28.387
INSPECTION. BEFORE THE DATE OF

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:31.090
INSTRUCTION. AND SO AGAIN I

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:32.892
DON'T KNOW WHY THEY THEY WOULD

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.927
WANNA WANNA HIDE SOMETHING LIKE

00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:36.262
THIS BUT BUT WORSE THAN THAT

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:37.830
THEY PUT IN THIS LETTER AND

00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:40.766
AGAIN HIT IT'S SORT OF- THE I

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.302
THINK IS BAD BECAUSE ARM. AT

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.103
ONE TIME THEY BELIEVE THEY WERE

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.771
PUBLIC SERVANTS AND I AND I

00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:47.006
STILL BELIEVE THEY BELIEVE THAT

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:48.541
PROBABLY THE MAJORITY THE

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:49.575
TEACHERS BUT THIS LETTER. SORT

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:51.811
O INCRIMINATES HIM- ON THIS

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:53.546
BILL SAYS IT ALLOWS PARENTS TO

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:55.347
REVIEW THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:57.650
AGAINST THIS RIGHT THIS OFTEN

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:59.051
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS PARENTS TO

00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:00.719
REVIEW THE INSTRUCTIONAL

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.421
MATERIALS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:03.856
BE POSTED ON THE DISTRICT'S

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:05.257
WEBSITE. INCLUDING TEACHERS

LESSON PLANS AND SCRIPTS

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:09.862
THERE'S MORE TO THIS LETTER.

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:10.763
BUT I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:11.630
ENOUGH AND YOU GET THE POINT

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:12.798
THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE. BUT

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.533
ANYWAY- FEDERATION OF TEACHERS

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.003
THANK YOU VERY MUCH STEP.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.206
POSTED A I THINK OUR ARGUMENT-

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:22.208
IN IT TOOK US ONE MOTHER BY THE

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:23.709
WAY AND SHE'S HERE TODAY JUST

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.711
IN CASE IT NOT. TO TESTIFY BUT

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:27.480
JUST IN CASE OF ANYBODY ON THE-

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:28.714
DíAS WOULD LIKE TO ASK HER

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:31.150
QUESTIONS- IN THE EAST BAY ONE

00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:32.718
MONTH. AND SHE'S NOT THE ONLY

00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:34.653
ONE THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. WHO

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.255
PRESTON HER SCHOOL DISTRICT.

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:38.457
AND OFFICIALS. AND IT TOOK OVER

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:40.292
ONE MONTH BEFORE SHE WAS GIVEN

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:41.894
PERMISSION. TO GO DOWN TO THE

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:44.296
SCHOOL AND THEN AT THAT TIME

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:45.664
THEY ONLY GAVE OUR HALF HOUR TO

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.066
REVIEW HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:48.701
MATERIAL. AND SO THIS IS WRONG

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:50.603
PARENTS SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:53.305
DECISION. MAKERS AND WHEN AND

00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:53.906
HOW THEIR CHILDREN ARE

00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:55.341
INTRODUCED TO SENSITIVE

00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:56.742
MATERIAL. NOT OF COURSE

00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:57.743
GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.812
HOPEFULLY WE ALL BELIEVE THAT.

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.413
AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.017
EVERYTHING. OUT IN THE OPEN AND

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:07.853
BY THE WAY. POLICY THAT FOR

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.821
LATER I AM AWARE THAT SOME

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.456
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL CENTERS

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:13.192
AROUND AN ACTIVE OPT IN POLICY.

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:15.694
BUT THIS IS WHAT FAMILIES ONE.

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:18.197
AND THAT'S WHAT SB SIX SEVENTY

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:19.064
THREE DOES SIMPLY IS LIKE A

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:20.666
PERMISSION SLIP. AND IT'S

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:23.335
INTERESTING BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:25.204
A FIELD TRIP. YOU HAVE TO HAVE

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:27.273
A PERMISSION SLIP RIGHT. BUT

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:28.440
YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THE MOST

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:29.742
SENSITIVE SUBJECTS WERE NOT

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:30.910
DOING THIS FOR OUR CHILDREN.

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:33.879
AND YET. AGAIN WE DON'T WANT TO

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:34.847
CUT THIS IS THIS IS WHAT'S

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:36.515
HAPPENING HERE IT SEEMS LIKE

00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:37.550
WE'RE CUTTING PARENTS OUT OF

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:40.219
THE LOOP IN EDUCATION. AND

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:42.087
THAT'S NOT GOOD BECAUSE-

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:44.356
RESEARCH SHOWS OVER AND OVER

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:46.825
AGAIN WHEN PARENTS ARE

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:47.393
INVOLVED. WHETHER IT'S MATH

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:48.260
SCIENCE AND LITERATURE. OR

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:51.430
SPORTS THEIR CHILDREN ALWAYS

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.932
PERFORM BETTER SO WE SHOULD

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.733
GIVE PARENTS FULL ACCESS FULL

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.769
DISCLOSURE SO IF PERMISSION

00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:58.204
SLIPS ARE REQUIRED FOR MUSEUM

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.373
TRIP OR A FIELD TRIP- BECAUSE

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.341
WE NEED THE RELEASE OF

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.610
LIABILITY TO INFORM THE PARENTS

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:05.477
WHERE AND WHENTHEIR CHILDREN

00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:07.947
ARE GOING TO BE- THE WANT TO

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:09.582
TRIP SURELY WE CAN ASK THE SAME

00:14:09.648 --> 00:14:11.584

PARENTS NOT GOVERNMENT

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:28.701
BUREAUCRACY FOR PARENTS WHILE

00:47:28.712 --> 00:47:29.446
YOU PLEASE RESPOND TO THE

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:30.347
RESEARCH CITED BY THE ACLU THAT

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:32.316
APPEAR TO SHOW THAT AN OPT OUT

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:35.118
APPROACH IS MORE LINED UP WITH

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:35.686
THE INTENTIONS OF PARENTS AS

00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:41.058
COMPARED TO AN OPT IN. ON.

00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:44.928
THREE SEVEN ON. YEAH IT IS A

00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:46.530
TESTIFIED EARLIER- BRIEFLY- THE

00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:49.766
RAND RESEARCH STUDY IS WHAT'S

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:51.501
RELIED ON NOT ON ONLY BY THE

00:47:51.568 --> 00:47:56.173
ACLU BUT IT'S REPEATED BY 80%

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.542
OF THE OPPOSITION LETTERS.

00:47:58.609 --> 00:48:01.311
CITED AS A TO SUCH A DECISIVE

00:48:01.378 --> 00:48:03.213
UP POINT THAT PARENTS PREFER

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.117
OPT OPT. OUT RATHER THAN OPT

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:09.286
IN. ABOUT FOUR AND FORTUNATELY

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:10.387
THE RAIN RESEARCH IS NOT

00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:12.322
SUPPORT THE POSITION. THAT OPT

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:14.191
OUT PASSIVE CONSENT MORE

00:48:14.258 --> 00:48:15.692
ACCURATELY REFLECTS PARENTS'

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:16.927
WISHES REGARDING COMPREHENSIVE

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:19.363
SEXUALITY EDUCATION. I'VE GOT A

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:22.165
COPY THE RAND STUDY HERE IN AND

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:25.369
ACTUALLY WAS- LIMITED STUDY OF

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:28.839
TWO SCHOOLS- END OF SEVENTH

00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:30.774
GRADE CLASSES IN TWO SCHOOLS.

00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:32.142
INITIALLY THERE WAS NOT

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:33.310
COMPREHENSIVE SEXUALITY

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:35.612
EDUCATION IT WAS STUDIED IN

00:48:35.679 --> 00:48:41.351
FACT IT WAS- A DREAD

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:41.952
REHABILITATION AND PREVENTION

00:48:42.019 --> 00:48:46.456
PROGRAM. AND PARENTS WERE

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:48.125
ACTUALLY NOT QUERIED AS TO WHAT

00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:49.059
THEIR PURPOSE WAS AS FAR AS AN

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:51.662
OPT IN OR OPT OUT. OF THE ROOM

00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:53.897
THE RAND RESEARCH TEAM- DEDUCED

00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:56.733
FROM THE RESPONSE RATES FROM AN

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.001
OPT OUT IN ONE SCHOOL IN AN OPT

00:48:58.068 --> 00:48:59.803
IN IN A SCHOOL WHAT'S PARENTS

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:00.570
WISHES WERE BUT THEY DIDN'T

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:02.272
ACTUALLY QUERY THE PARENTS ON

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:05.075
WHAT THEIR PREFERENCE WAS. IT

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:09.613
BUT EVEN IF THEY HAD. IS A

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.781
THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD STUDY IT

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:12.115
WAS A LIMITED POOL. OF SCHOOLS

00:49:12.182 --> 00:49:13.650
AND WASN'T TALKING ABOUT

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:14.918
COMPREHENSIVE SEXUALITY

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:16.253
EDUCATION WHETHER PARENTS

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:16.887
PREFERRED AN OPT IN OR OPT OUT

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:17.988
ESPECIALLY. FOR YOUNGER

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:20.557
CHILDREN. AND SO THE STUDY

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:23.293
ITSELF IS. IT IT IT'S NOT EVEN

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.062
A STUDY OF OPT IN OPT OUT IN

00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:26.663
THE SEXUALITY EDUCATION A

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:28.732
SPHERE NOR IS IT A STUDY-

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.500
INVOLVING AND HER CHILDREN. AND

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:32.169
SO THIS EVEN LOOK AT THE STUDY

00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:33.003
YOURSELF I ENCOURAGE THE

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.938
SENATORS TO DO SO AND I'VE GOT

00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:36.006
A COPY THE CITY HERE IF ANYBODY

00:49:36.073 --> 00:49:39.876
WANTS TO SEE IT- BUT THEY

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:40.944
SPECULATED ABOUT WHAT PARENTAL

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:43.213
RIGHTS. WHAT PRINT PRINT

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.147
PARENTS PREFERRED AS FAR AS AN

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:46.717
OPT IN OR OPT OUT. BUT A COUPLE

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:49.986
POINT SOMEONE A QUOTE FROM THE

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:53.056
STUDY ITSELF. THERE THERE THERE

00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:55.892
WAS TWO TWO POINTS ON PAGE FOR

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:58.762
THE STUDY VOTE. THIS EXTREMELY

00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:59.529
SMALL POOL IS NOT GENERALIZE

00:49:59.596 --> 00:50:01.298
GENERALIZABLE TO ALL SCHOOL

00:50:01.365 --> 00:50:03.400
ENVIRONMENTS SHE CAN'T TAKE

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:06.203
THAT ONE STUDY THAT HAD DIDN'T

00:50:06.269 --> 00:50:06.837
HAVE ANYTHING DO WITH SIX SAID

00:50:06.903 --> 00:50:08.405
AND SAY WHAT AT APPLIES TO ANY

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:10.707
OTHER SCHOOL LET ALONE

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:12.309
REGARDING SEXUALITY EDUCATION

00:50:12.376 --> 00:50:13.510
SECONDLY THE SITE THE RAND

00:50:13.577 --> 00:50:15.712
STUDY SAYS QUOTE. DECIDING

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:16.680
WHETHER PASSIVE OR ACTIVE

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:19.416
CONSENT IS APPROPRIATE MUST BE

00:50:19.483 --> 00:50:22.953
DECIDED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:24.488
AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT WE'RE

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:26.189
TRYING TO DO HERE TODAY IS TO

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:29.192
SAY YOU KNOW AN OPT OUT MAY BE

00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:31.261
APPROPRIATE FOR SEVENTH THROUGH

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:35.966
TWELFTH GRADERS BUT AN OPT IN

00:50:36.032 --> 00:50:37.601
WITH MORE PARENTAL BUT IN

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:40.837
CONTROL IS THE PRO. FOR YOUR

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:44.975
STUDENTS AND FINALLY WHAT I.

00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:45.542
USE AN OPT IN OR OUT OPT OUT

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:47.778
APPROACH THE KEY ISSUE IS

00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:49.980
INFORMED CONSENT. THE PARENTS

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.415
THEMSELVES ACTUALLY NEED TO BE

00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:52.849
INFORMED OF WHAT THEY'RE BEING

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:55.318
ASKED TO DECIDE UPON IN OTHER

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:56.720
WORDS HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:58.188
ACCESS TO THE CREEK ON

00:50:58.255 --> 00:50:59.756
TRANSPARENCY IS THE KEY ISSUE

00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:03.693
OF THIS BILL BUT SECONDLY- THEY

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.962
NEED TO- ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY

00:51:06.029 --> 00:51:08.765
ATTENTION TO THEM. AND THE BEST

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:10.066
WAY TO FORCE PICKED HER PARENTS

00:51:10.133 --> 00:51:13.036
TO GIVE ACTIVE CONSENT INFORMED

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:14.938
CONSENT IS ACTUALLY REQUIRE

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:16.473
THAT. URGE THE PARENTS TO LOOK

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.241
AT THE MATERIALS AND THAT'S

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:19.443
WHAT AN OP PRECISELY WITHIN

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:22.012
OFTEN DOES. NOT BEEN SAYS HEY

00:51:22.078 --> 00:51:24.281
YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTIVELY.

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:26.416
DECIDING PROACTIVELY TO. PUT

00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:29.619
YOUR CHILD IN THIS PROGRAM EVEN

00:51:29.686 --> 00:51:31.021
THOUGH THEY MAY BE IS JOHN IS

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:33.290
FIVE YEARS OLD- THE AGE GROUP

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:35.225
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS NOT

00:51:35.292 --> 00:51:37.227
YOUNG ADULTS ARE LITTLE LITTLE

00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:39.329
ADULTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE

00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:40.964
YEAR OLD CHILDREN- TO TWELVE

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:43.467
YEAR OLD CHILDREN. AND SO IF

00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:43.967
YOU WANT TO HAVE ACTUAL

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:46.169
INFORMED CONSENT. WE NEED TO

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:47.304
HAVE AN OPT IN AND WE NEED THE

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.072
TRANSPARENCY INVOLVED.

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:51.508
OTHERWISE THERE'S A VERY BIG

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:53.376
DANGER THAT CHILDREN WILL BE

00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:55.078
SUBJECTED TO EARLY SEXUALITY

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:57.180
EDUCATION WHEN THEIR PARENTS

00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:58.415
ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

00:51:58.482 --> 00:52:00.550
PROGRAM OR DON'T DON'T AT

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:04.754

ENGAGEMENTS- USUALLY IN

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:42.758
PARTNERSHIP WITH TEACHERS AND-

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:45.128
AGAIN ELECTED SCHOOL BOARDS-

OUR OF STUDENTS OF PARTICULARLY

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:51.000
PARENTAL ENGAGEMENT OF THEIR

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:51.567
OWN CHILDREN YEAH AND THEIR

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:52.768
CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IS

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:54.837
CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE VALUE ON

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:58.341
WHICH TO HAPPEN- I THINK- YEAH

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:00.843
MIGHT IN TURN. THAT WHAT DO

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:02.812
HAVE MULTIPLE MECHANISMS FOR

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:06.182
PEOPLE TO BOTH BE ENGAGED IN

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:06.782
THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT OF THE

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:09.852
CURRICULA. WE JUST HEARD.

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:10.720
CERTAINLY WE CREATE GIVE THE

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:14.290
OPPORTUNITY- FOR PARENTS FOR

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:16.959
THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO OPT OUT-

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:20.563
MY CONCERN IS THAT- BY CREATING

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.964
AN OPT IN WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:25.268
DENYING- SOME CHILDREN TO- MAY

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:27.603
NOT AND FORTUNATELY HAVE A

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.005
FAMILY SITUATION OR SOCIAL

01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:31.607
SITUATION THAT MAKES IT- AS IS

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:36.679
POSSIBLE FOR THOSE FAMILIES TO

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:40.750
BE ABLE TO- TO BE ES DID TO

01:03:40.816 --> 01:03:42.919
ACTUALLY MAY LOSE OUT ON AN FOR

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:44.320
IT POURTANT. THEIR EDUCATION

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:47.290
AND WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:50.960
ACTUALLY HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:53.362
THE WAY AND THAT AND AGAIN I

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:54.297
WOULD FIND YOU THAT THE ACTION

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:54.830
I WAS TO SAY IS THAT THE

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:55.831
OVERALL CURRICULA IS SOMETHING

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:57.767
THAT DOES GO THROUGH A YOU KNOW

01:03:57.833 --> 01:04:00.469
OF A PUBLIC PROCESS BOTH AT THE

01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:03.306
STATE THE STANDS ARE SET STATE

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:05.308
AND ALSO THE SCHOOL BOARD LEVEL

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:06.809
SO. THAT MEANS THE COMMUNITY AT

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:08.077
LARGE THIS IS A STANDARD THAT

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:11.147
WE- THE WHOLE. AND CERTAINLY IF

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:11.948
PARENTS WISH THEIR CHILDREN OUT

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:13.649
OF CERTAIN PIECES OF THAT-

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:16.219
UNDERSTAND THAT- BUT I THINK

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:18.588
THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF AN

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:20.323
ACTIVE DECISION. TO OPT OUT

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:22.725
THAT SINCE WE'VE COMMUNITY

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.160
COLLECTIVELY OF SAID THIS IS

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:25.394
SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT PARTS ON

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:27.129
EDUCATION. THE CHAU CHILDREN

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:28.698
SHOULD BE A FAILED OF THAT

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:32.468
UNLESS. SAID THAT THIRTY DAY

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:33.202
FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN I

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:35.871
DISAGREE SO- ITH THAT AND FOR

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:37.373
SHALL NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT BILL

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.842
TONIGHT. OUR FINAL QUESTION SO

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.744
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:45.815
YES. OKAY SO WHAT I SEE THE OP

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:47.917
ART. THE HOUSE AND THE PAIR MAY

WHAT IF THEY DON'T LOOK AT THE

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:59.829
MAIL- THAT IS GOING TO BE FEWER

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:03.399
PARTICIPANTS BUT THE OFTEN

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:05.501

ALL THE REASONS THAT WE'VE

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:18.934
DECIDED THAT AN IMPORTANT PART

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.202
OF THE STATION. ESTABLISHED

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:23.339

THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY THINK

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:38.888
THAT EVERY CHILD. OUT YOU KNOW

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:39.555

THE GENERAL UNITY. WE IN THE

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:49.665
OPPORTUNITY BUT IF WE DO. BUT

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.435
OTHERWISE I WOULD SAY IS THAT.

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:54.170
THE DEFAULT SHOULD BE THAT WE

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:55.771
WENT THROUGH. HELLO YES WE HAD

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:57.139
A LOT TO THE SCHOOL BOARD.

01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:58.641
PROCESS TO ESTABLISH WHAT THE

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.443
CURRICULUM SHOULD BE THAT EVERY

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:03.646

PARENT HAS A DIFFERENCE OF

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:08.017
OPINION DATE OF THE OPERATING

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.919
ROOM TROUT THAT. WITHOUT

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:10.820
ACTUALLY SAYING. MY CHECK NO

01:08:10.886 --> 01:08:12.655
PORTION THE EDUCATION THAT IS.

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:13.722
LIKE THE GENERAL EDUCATION THEY

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:15.257
CAN ALSO GO ARGUE WITH SCHOOL

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:16.091
BOARD ABOUT WELL WE DON'T WANT

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.460
CHAGE THE CONTENT I'M NOT YOU

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:20.963
KNOW I HAVE A CONCERN THAT

01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.464
OTHER CHILDREN HAVE ANY

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:23.032
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T AGREE

01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:25.067
WITH. HELLO TALK TO THE SCHOOL

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:25.501

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:28.838
CONVERSATION SCHOOL WHICH ALSO

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:29.438
BY THE WAY HAS ELECTED MEMBERS

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:32.274
ON THAT BOARD IBM THAT'S- LIKE

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:35.411
THE ICING. ON THAT BUT- THAT IS

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:36.879
MY POINT OF VIEW ABOUT HOW WE

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:37.580
SHOULD HEAR ABOUT YEAH THIS

01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:39.081
PARTICULAR AND TO ANSWER THAT

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:40.015
THE REASON WE GOT THIS BILL

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:42.685
GONE IS THE OPT OUTREALLY CUTS

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:44.587
PARENTS OUT A LOOP IN MANY WAYS

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:47.556
BECAUSE HOW THIS GOT STARTED A

01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:48.491
THE PASTOR IN MY DISTRICT

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:50.159
ACTUALLY CALLED ME AND TOLD ME

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:52.795
WHAT HE DID HE FOUND OUT HIS

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:53.896
DISTRICT. WHAT THE SCHOOL

01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:56.599
IMPLEMENTED THIS TO CURRICULUM

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:59.902
OKAY. ANY BOARD APPROVAL. AND

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.537
WITHOUT ANY- TELL ANY PARENT SO

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:02.304
THE PARENTS WERE SHOCKED WHEN

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:03.772
THEIR KIDS CAME HOME TOLL THAT.

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.140
FULL IT TO HIM SO HE DID A

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:06.509
LITTLE RESEARCH HE HAS A LARGE

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:08.477
CONGREGATION. AND HE ASKS

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:11.480
CONGER GETS TO- TAKEN KEEP

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:13.182
THESE KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL FOR A

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:15.251
DAY AND THEY DID. AN ARE THE

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:17.119
SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT WAS DOWN

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:19.088
THERE PRETTY QUICK I THINK

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.456
ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS OR

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:23.125
SOMETHING. BUT THE THING IS SEE

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:25.528
THIS HAPPENING OTHER PLACES TOO

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:26.662
SO THE OPT OUT IS NOT. WORKING

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:31.400
BECAUSE- IT'S ARE FINDING OUT

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:32.001
AFTER THE FACT THEIR KIDS GET

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:34.003
THIS. INFORMATION THEN THEY

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:34.803
FOUND OUT CUT OFF. SHOULD A

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.138
MALE THAT THING IN AS IT'S AN

01:17:11.426 --> 01:17:13.962
PARENTS I COME FROM COMMUNITIES

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:18.266
THAT- MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:20.802
THAT- HAVE TRADITIONALLY

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:23.038
HISTORICALLY BEEN EXCLUDED FROM

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:24.406
THAT KIND OF DECISION MAKING

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:26.274
SOME VERY BIG. AND IT'S VERY

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:27.943
IMPORTANT FOR ME FOR OUR

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.044
COMMUNITIES AND PARENTS TO BE

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:32.214
INVOLVED N THE DECISION MAKING

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.382
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S WHAT

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:36.118
WE OUGHT TO FIX. IF IT'S BEING

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:38.553
DONE THE WRONG WAY IF PARENTS

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.188
ARE NOT BEING INCLUDED IF

01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:41.456
DISTRICTS ARE MAKING DECISIONS

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:43.325
WITH THAT. MOMENT THAT'S THE

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:44.926
PROBLEM THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:47.729
THAT'S A PROBLEM WE SHOULD FIX.

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:50.232
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT BUT

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:52.968
I THINK THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO.

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:54.102
THE WAY THAT IT IS SET UP THERE

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:55.704
IS AN ITEM NOT GOING TO REPEAT

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:56.505
EVERYTHING THAT SENATOR POUND

01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:58.774
SAID BUT THE WAY IT'S SET UP IS

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.108
FOR LOCAL AGENCIES LOCAL

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:02.110
EDUCATION AGENCIES. TO GO

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:06.982
pNOT LET'S FIX THAT UP THAT'S

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:07.883
THE PROCESS WERE PARENTS SHOULD

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:10.986
BE INVOLVED- I DO THINK THAT

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:13.021
THOSE THAT PROCESS SHOULD

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:16.425
INVOLVE OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR-

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.660
NON ENGLISH SPEAKING OR NON

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:21.630
PRIMARY ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE

01:18:21.696 --> 01:18:23.799
AND COMMUNITIES TO BE INVOLVED

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:24.633
SO I WOULD. WISH FOR THAT UP

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:27.936
PART AS WELL. OF AND THEN LEAVE

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:29.271
IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:31.339
DECISION YOU CAN HAVE YOUR

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:34.876
CHILD NOT PARTICIPATE SO I'VE

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:39.414
SEEN. WHAT I SEE BEFORE ME IS.

01:18:39.481 --> 01:18:40.982
A WAY IN WHICH EVERY PARENT

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.350
EITHER COLLECTIVE OR

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:44.152
INDIVIDUALLY PERSONALLY THE

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:48.123
RIGHT. TO IS HAS A RIGHT TO

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.459
MAKE THAT DECISION ABOUT THEIR

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:53.195
CHILDREN- AND I THINK THAT

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:57.799
THERE IT'S IMPORTANT. I SEE

01:18:57.866 --> 01:19:02.671
THIS EDUCATION AS A HEALTH. A

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:04.506
HEALTH ISSUE UP IN. OUR PARK

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:05.474
BUILDER NEED TO BE TAUGHT AND

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.341
IF WE DON'T AGREE HOW LET'S

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:07.609
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT BUT

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:08.610
IT IS A HEALTH CARE ISSUE AND I

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:10.378
THINK THE ISSUE OF TEEN

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:12.514
PREGNANCIES IS JUST ONE PIECE

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:13.949
OF IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:15.584
THINGS INVOLVED WITH SEX

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.486
EDUCATION THE IT'S NOT

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:20.021
SEXUALITY IT'S ABOUT THE HEALTH

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:23.258
CARE OF OUR CHILDREN SO I'M

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:25.660
REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THE MODEL.

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:28.630
THAT YOU MADE UP- AND- BECAUSE

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:32.000
I FEEL THAT THERE IS A PROCESS

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:34.102
FOR PARENTS TO BE INVOLVED TO

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:36.705
MAKE DECISIONS- THAT I WILL BE

01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:39.341

I WOULD JUST LIKE TO WEIGH IN.

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:51.253
AS A MOTHER OF TWENTY SEVEN

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:52.854
YEAR OLD TWIN DAUGHTERS WHO HAD

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:54.523
SEX EDUCATION AND PUBLIC

01:19:54.589 --> 01:19:57.325
SCHOOLS- I DID NOT FEEL THAT IT

01:19:57.392 --> 01:20:00.195
WAS NOT AGE APPROPRIATE I HAD

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:02.664
THE OPPORTUNITY AS A PARENT. TO

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:04.332
REVIEW THE MATERIAL IF I WENT

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:06.168
INTO THE SCHOOL AND FOR IT

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:07.936
WHICH I BELIEVE ALL PARENTS

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:11.006
HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW. IF YOU DO

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:12.874
IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR CHILD

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:15.544
TO RECEIVE SEX EDUCATION I

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:16.511
WOULD BE VERY PROACTIVE AS A

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:18.213
PARENT I WOULD WALK TO THE

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.648
OFFICE THEN I WOULD SAY MY

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:22.484
DAUGHTER IS. OUR SON IS IN. YOU

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:23.451

CONTINUE TO DO THAT I WILL ASK

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:26.388
FOR THE SERGEANTS TO REMOVE

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:29.791
FEEL. IF I DID NOT MY CHILD. TO

RECEIVE SEX EDUCATION I WOULD

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:32.994
GO INTO THE OFFICE I WOULD

01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:34.930
SPEAK TO THE PRINCIPLE. AND I

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:36.598

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:40.001
TIME ARISES THAT THEY'RE GOING

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:42.604
TO TEACH SEX EDUCATION. BUT DID

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:43.205
NOT WANT MY CHILD TO BE A PART

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:45.807
OF THAT ALL. THEY MET WHICH

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:47.809
WOULD BE I UNDERSTAND. WE DID

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:48.376
NOT HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE AND

01:20:48.443 --> 01:20:50.378

SOMETHING THAT I COULD NOT VOTE

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:12.734
ON I THINK THAT PARENTS SHOULD

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:14.269
BE INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:16.404

THIS ROOM HAVE READ THE

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.612

PRESENTATION TODAY- BUT- THE

02:21:44.929 --> 02:21:47.498
CURRENT TAX THE BILL DOES READ

02:21:47.565 --> 02:21:49.734
THAT YOU CANNOT CONSIDER THE

02:21:49.801 --> 02:21:51.135

02:22:04.482 --> 02:22:06.084
THE BILL WHETHER OR AT WHAT

02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:07.719
POINT THERE SHOULD POTENTIALLY

02:22:07.785 --> 02:22:09.153
BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:12.123
ACCREDITATION OR- OR

02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:13.758

HAS- ON THOSE TYPES OF HIGHER

02:22:16.394 --> 02:22:20.832
EDUCATION- DEGREES. BUT I THINK

02:22:20.899 --> 02:22:22.066
THIS IS THAT WE HAVE WE DON'T

02:22:22.133 --> 02:22:23.601
HAVE ANY FORMAL OPPOSITION YES

02:22:23.668 --> 02:22:24.669
WE ARE AN EARLY DISCUSSIONS

02:22:24.736 --> 02:22:26.738
WITH PARTIES- TO DETERMINE

02:22:26.804 --> 02:22:28.673
WHETHER LOS COULD TRULY DOES

02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:31.609
REQUIRE- CERTAIN TYPES OF

02:22:31.676 --> 02:22:34.178
FACILITIES TO- BE THE ONES THAT

02:22:34.245 --> 02:22:36.547
ARE- INTERACTING WITH THE

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:37.482
STUDENTS OR IF IT'S JUST THAT

02:22:37.548 --> 02:22:39.217
THE ABILITY THE SCHOOL PARTNERS

02:22:39.284 --> 02:22:41.653
WITH. HAS A RESTRICTION BECAUSE

02:22:41.719 --> 02:22:42.887
IT'S DEFECTIVE WALK

02:22:42.954 --> 02:22:44.188
ACCREDITATION REQUIRES IT

02:22:44.255 --> 02:22:45.423
VERSUS THE SCHOOL THE

02:22:45.490 --> 02:22:48.426
INDIVIDUAL DEMONSTRATIONS ALSO

02:22:48.493 --> 02:22:49.160
IT FOR SO WHY ASK ISN'T THE

02:22:49.227 --> 02:22:52.897
ONLY. TREPIDATION BODY SO I

02:22:52.964 --> 02:22:56.668
GUESS. BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT I

02:22:56.734 --> 02:23:00.605
THINK. THE AND THE I WOULD LIKE

02:23:00.672 --> 02:23:01.973
TO SEE THIS THE AYE AYE AYE AYE

02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:02.707
A NOT INTERESTED IN TRYING TO

02:23:02.774 --> 02:23:03.474
PREVENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE A

02:23:03.541 --> 02:23:04.442
HISTORY OF INCARCERATION FROM

02:23:04.509 --> 02:23:07.211
BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW BE ABLE

02:23:07.278 --> 02:23:09.213
TO THE SICKLY PURSUE WHAT THEY

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:10.982
WANT TO TRY PURSUE I DO THINK

02:23:11.049 --> 02:23:12.817
THAT THE- AND BIG HAULAGE IS I

02:23:12.884 --> 02:23:15.086
MEAN THERE THERE IS SERVICE

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:15.620
THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN

02:23:15.687 --> 02:23:19.891
WHICH- IF. THE STUDENT IS NOT.

02:23:19.958 --> 02:23:21.059
YOU KNOW GIVEN THE

02:23:21.125 --> 02:23:22.393
RELATIONSHIPS THEY HAVE AND

02:23:22.460 --> 02:23:25.096
AGAIN THIS IS. MEET THE SECOND

02:23:25.163 --> 02:23:26.397
FOR THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS NOT

02:23:26.464 --> 02:23:27.865
ALL OF YOUR TRAINING SITES ANY

02:23:27.932 --> 02:23:29.634
OF CONTRACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS

02:23:29.701 --> 02:23:30.802
WITH THEM BUT THEY'RE NOT

02:23:30.868 --> 02:23:31.602
ENTIRELY IN YOUR OWN CONTROL

02:23:31.669 --> 02:23:33.905
RIGHT. SO AND I'LL TELL YOU

02:23:33.972 --> 02:23:35.673
THAT I WAS IN A SITUATION WHERE

02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:37.342
WE ACTUALLY BECAUSE A-

02:23:37.408 --> 02:23:39.110
POTENTIAL CLINICAL SITE

02:23:39.177 --> 02:23:41.112
ACTUALLY HAD STANDARDS THAT WE

02:23:41.179 --> 02:23:43.047
DISAGREE WITH YOU CHOSE NOT TO.

02:23:43.114 --> 02:23:44.582
CONTACT WITHOUT THAT'S

02:23:44.649 --> 02:23:45.750
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH IT'S NOT

02:23:45.817 --> 02:23:46.951
EASY TO FIND CLINICAL SITES IN

02:23:47.018 --> 02:23:48.519
FACT THAT'S BEEN GETTING MORE

02:23:48.586 --> 02:23:49.787
MORE DIFFICULT OVER TIME

02:23:49.854 --> 02:23:50.688
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION

02:23:50.755 --> 02:23:53.424
FOR THEM. AND SO THE CHALLENGE

02:23:53.491 --> 02:23:56.861
THERE IS THAT. IT IT SO IT'S

02:23:56.928 --> 02:23:57.695
NOT THE UNIVERSITY IT'S ABOUT

02:23:57.762 --> 02:23:59.097
IF I AM LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO A

02:23:59.163 --> 02:24:00.331
CLINICAL ROTATION AN ACCIDENT

02:24:00.398 --> 02:24:01.632
OR FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO

02:24:01.699 --> 02:24:03.801
GRADUATE NOR FREEDIA LICENSE

02:24:03.868 --> 02:24:06.838
WHATEVER ELSE OKAY SO. AND THE

02:24:06.904 --> 02:24:08.473
ONLY THE CLINICAL SAY THAT WE

02:24:08.539 --> 02:24:12.477
HAVE. FOR WHATEVER REASONS SAYS

02:24:12.543 --> 02:24:15.113
THAT WE WILL NOT ALLOW. YEAH

02:24:15.179 --> 02:24:16.247
ANYONE WHO HAS CERTAIN TYPE OF

02:24:16.314 --> 02:24:18.182
CONVICTION TO BE LET'S SAY

02:24:18.249 --> 02:24:19.417
ALONG WITH THE PATIENT OR

02:24:19.484 --> 02:24:21.352
WHATEVER AS FOR PATIENT

02:24:21.419 --> 02:24:23.154
PROTECTION PURPOSES. NOW WE MAY

02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:24.789
OR MAY NOT DISAGREE OR DISAGREE

02:24:24.856 --> 02:24:27.492
ABOUT TAT BUT THAT'S THE- ONLY

02:24:27.558 --> 02:24:29.060
SITE THEY HAVE ARE ALL THEIR

02:24:29.127 --> 02:24:30.361
SITES HAVE THAT THAT KIND OF

02:24:30.428 --> 02:24:32.096
RULE ORDER MAY EVEN BE A STATE

02:24:32.163 --> 02:24:33.598
LAW HAS SENDS THEM SOMETHING WE

02:24:33.664 --> 02:24:35.666
ACTUALLY REGULATION. THEN IT'S

02:24:35.733 --> 02:24:37.668
NOT FAIR TO THE STUDIO FAIR TO

02:24:37.735 --> 02:24:39.070
THE STUDENTS THAT WE ADMIT YOU

02:24:39.137 --> 02:24:41.039
PROGRAM BUT YOU ACTUALLY CAN'T

02:24:41.105 --> 02:24:41.572
COMPLETED BECAUSE WE CAN'T

02:24:41.639 --> 02:24:43.307
PROVIDE YOU. THE KIND OF

02:24:43.374 --> 02:24:43.875
TRAINING YOU NEED THAT WILL

02:24:43.941 --> 02:24:44.809
ALLOW YOU TO COMPLETE ALL YOUR

02:24:44.876 --> 02:24:47.879
REQUIREMENTS. THAT SO WITH THAT

02:24:47.945 --> 02:24:50.515
I THINK THAT'S THE PART THAT.

02:24:50.581 --> 02:24:54.952
WE NEED TO ADDRESS. AND SIX-

02:24:55.019 --> 02:24:56.988
AND THAT'S WHY SAYING THAT

02:24:57.055 --> 02:24:57.655
THERE NEEDS TO BE AN

02:24:57.722 --> 02:24:59.424
OPPORTUNITY BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY

02:24:59.490 --> 02:25:00.925
OPERATE MISSION BECAUSE WE

02:25:00.992 --> 02:25:02.193

OPPORTUNITY GRADUATE AND IF YOU

02:25:07.131 --> 02:25:10.001
CAN. THAT'S NOT FAIR EITHER.

02:25:10.068 --> 02:25:12.170
YES I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN

02:25:12.236 --> 02:25:13.171
FOR DEFINITELY AND I THINK WHAT

02:25:13.237 --> 02:25:15.339

02:25:15.406 --> 02:25:16.641
FROM AUTHORS OFFICE WERE TRYING

02:25:16.707 --> 02:25:18.676
TO PARSE LICENSING. AND

02:25:18.743 --> 02:25:20.578
GRADUATION AND ACCREDITATION

02:25:20.645 --> 02:25:22.613
THAT YOU NEED FOR GRADUATION

02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:24.315
AND YES WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE

02:25:24.382 --> 02:25:26.184
THAT GET ENROLLED IN A PROGRAM

02:25:26.250 --> 02:25:27.051
THAT THEY CAN'T GRADUATE FROM

02:25:27.118 --> 02:25:29.420
BECAUSE OF RESTRICTIONS-

02:25:29.487 --> 02:25:31.022
LICENSING HOWEVER IS CHANGING

02:25:31.089 --> 02:25:32.957
RAPIDLY AND PEOPLE WHO GRADUATE

02:25:33.024 --> 02:25:34.559
WITH A GRADUATE DEGREE MAY NOT
