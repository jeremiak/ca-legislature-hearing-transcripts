00:58:26.236 --> 00:58:28.805
ERA IT'S ANTICIPATED THAT SOME

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:30.273
OF THE SERVICES WOULD BE

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.942
PROVIDED NEARBY- IN THE KIOSK

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:34.844
FORMAT SOME OF THEM WOULD BE

00:58:34.911 --> 00:58:37.180
ONLINE. AND SOME OF THE MAY NEED

00:58:37.247 --> 00:58:41.150
TO BE LOCATED IN A PHYSICAL

00:58:41.217 --> 00:58:42.819

TOTALLY WITHIN- PER. THEY WILL.

00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:47.090
WHAT SERVICES ARE NECESSARY I'M

00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:50.093
QUITE CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD-

00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:51.394
NOT DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:53.196
DIMINISH THE SERVICES THAT ARE

00:58:53.263 --> 00:58:55.131

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:57.767
THESE THREE. OF PROJECTS ARE

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:59.335
NEAR ONE ANOTHER THEY CAN

00:58:59.402 --> 00:59:02.105
NEGOTIATE THESE LEASES IN A IN A

00:59:02.171 --> 00:59:07.644
WAY- THAT TO A- ALLOWS FOR. A

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.379
STAGE CONSTRUCTION THEY DON'T

00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:11.047
HAVE TO DO AND I DON'T THINK

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:12.882
THEY WOULD DO ALL THREE OF THESE

00:59:12.949 --> 00:59:14.250
FACILITIES AT THE SAME TIME THEY

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:16.152
COULD DO ONE AFTER THE OTHER SO

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:18.187
THAT- THERE WAS SOME CONTINUITY.

00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:19.956
IN SERVICES IN THE REGION

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:22.992
THEY'RE ALL WITHIN A RELATIVE

00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:24.961
FEW MILES FROM ONE ANOTHER.

THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND THEN I

00:59:26.162 --> 00:59:28.031
