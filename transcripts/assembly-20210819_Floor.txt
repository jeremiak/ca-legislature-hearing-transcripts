FORTUNATELY AMAZING AMAZING INNOVATIVE ADVANCES IN CANCER SCIENCE ARE CREATING MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS AND CURES FOR PATIENTS. WHILE THESE ADVANCES IN CARE ARE LIFE CHANGING THERE ARE ETHNIC AND SOCIO ECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN CANCER OUTCOMES. ALIGNED WITH A LACK OF ACCESS FOR THESE CUTTING EDGE TREATMENTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS. THE RIGHTS OF THESE PATIENTS TRANSCEND BEYOND ECONOMIC STATUS AND ETHNICITY. CANCER PATIENTS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE MOST ADVANCED TREATMENT DESPITE. DESPITE INEQUITABLE BARRIERS THAT LEAVE THEM MUCH MORE VULNERABLE FROM THEIR INITIAL DIAGNOSES. S. R. S. C. R. ELEVEN PROCLAIMS CANCER PATIENTS SHOULD HAVE A KEY RIGHTS SUCH AS BEING APPROPRIATELY INFORMED ABOUT THEIR DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT OPTIONS AS WELL AS TIMELY ACCESS TO CANCER SPECIALISTS AND THOSE WITH EXPERTISE IN THE TREATMENT OF THEIR CANCER.

THIS RESOLUTION INCLUDES IMPORTANT RIGHTS THAT EVERY CANCER PATIENT CALIFORNIA SHOULD EXPECT FROM THE TIME THEY'RE DIAGNOSE.

THE INLAND EMPIRE IS PACKED WITH THE RESULTS OF HIS DECADES OF SERVICE TO OUR REGION. IN ADDITION TO A SERVICE TO THE STATE AND THE NATION. HE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC UCLA ALUMNI. SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN WE VISITED WITH- CONGRESSMAN LEWIS AND HIS OFFICE HE WOULD BRING HIS BELOVED DOG OUT OF BROUGH AND TO MEET WITH THOSE THAT WERE VISITING WITH HIM. BEFORE HIS ELECTION TO CONGRESS HE SERVED THE INLAND EMPIRE. AS ASSEMBLY NO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF TRUSTEE MEMBER. SERVED ON THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT.

HE WAS THE LONGEST SERVING REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY AND CHAIRED THE POWERFUL HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. WE CONSIDER JERRY AND ARLENE OUR DEAR FRIENDS. MANY MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THE DURING HIS TIME IN THE ASSEMBLY HE LED THE EFFORT THAT ESTABLISHED THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT BECAUSE EVEN IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULD ALREADY SEE THE EFFECTS OF SMOG. IN OUR COMMUNITY. JERRY LEWIS APPROACH PUBLIC SERVICE ON THE FOUNDATION OF BI PARTISANSHIP WHERE HE WORKED TO GET VITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND IN CALIFORNIA. NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE REPUBLICAN IDEAS OR DEMOCRAT IDEAS. BECAUSE THEY WERE NEEDED. REGARDLESS OF PARTY AFFILIATION OR POLITICS JERRY WORKED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE RECEIVED ITS FAIR SHARE. JERRY'S LEADERSHIP IN FACT WAS KEY IN PROVIDING THE FIRST FUNDING FOR HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND SINCE THEN. IT HAS GROWN FROM THE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS INITIAL MONEY TO TODAY BEING NOW OVER ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE MILLION. JERRY LEWIS EXEMPLIFIED THE DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY AND DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOUR DISTRICT IS BIGGER THAN PART PARTY AFFILIATION AND POLITICS. HE IS REMEMBERED FONDLY IN WASHINGTON DC AND ACROSS THE INLAND EMPIRE FOR HIS YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE. I ASK THAT THIS HOUSE ADJOURNED IN THE MEMORY OF OUR FRIEND AND OUR REPRESENTATIVE JERRY LEWIS. THANK YOU MISS FRANCISCO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THIS INTERMINABLY. CALLERS I JUST WANT TO RISE I ACTUALLY RECALL- JERRY LEWIS TURNER SERVICE IN THIS HOUSE. HE HAD JUST A TREMENDOUS. FRIENDLINESS ABOUT IT OBVERSE ALLOWED GOING I HE WAS A VERY INFLUENTIAL MEMBER JUST FOR THE POWER OF HIS PERSONALITY IN THIS COLLEGIAL BODY. AND I ALSO THINK HE SORT OF A MARKER HE ENTERED THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS FOR A TIME DISRUPTED AND IN AN ALTERED QUARTERS WHICH OF COURSE IS NUMBER SO THAT WE SEE FACING US IN THE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND SO I DO REMEMBER HIM IN THIS CHAMBERS IN THE TEMPERATE CHAMBERS ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING. BUT- YEAH I JUST VERY DISTINCTLY RECALLED JERRY LEWIS AND HIS PRESENCE IN THIS BODY AND SO THE NEWS OF HIS PASSING STRUCK ME IN A DIFFERENT SORT OF PERSONAL WAY SINCE I KNEW HIM AS A YOUNG MAN. SO I JUST. AN HONOR TO JOIN IN HIS MEMORY THE STATE. THANK YOU MISTER WILLIAMS MAYES YOU ARE. THE MINISTRY CARE INTO MEMBERS TODAY I ALSO WANNA JOIN MY OLLEAGUES- IN ASKING THAT WE DURING THE MEMORY OF CONGRESSMAN JERRY LEWIS. WHO DEVOTE ONLY REPRESENTED AT THE INLAND EMPIRE COMMUNITIES FOR FORTY NINE YEARS AT AT AT EVERY ENTRY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. INCLUDING HERE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY HE WAS A PUBLIC SERVANT IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD. I I GOT ELECTED TO THE YUCCA VALLEY TOWN COUNCIL WHEN I WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I WAS. A TWENTY FIVE I LOOKED UP- TO CONGRESSMAN LEWIS IS THE GUY WHO I WANTED TO. TO EMULATE CONGRESSMAN LEWIS WAS MY CONGRESSMAN I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN MY PARENTS MOVED. OUT TO YUCCA VALLEY FROM FROM BACK EAST IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WHEN HE GOT ELECTED AS A CONGRESSMAN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND HE WAS MY CONGRESSMAN. UP UNTIL HE RETIRED IN IN IN TWENTY TWELVE. AND YOU CAN HEAR THE COMMENTS- OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHETHER. YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN- YOU ADORED HIM- HE WAS A BELOVED BACK IN WASHINGTON DC HE WAS BELOVED A BACK HOME AND HE DIDN'T MATTER TO HIM. WHETHER YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN WHAT MATTERED TO HIM- IS WHETHER YOU CARED ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND WHERE YOU YOU CARED ABOUT- THIS THIS COUNTRY. I SO WISH THAT WE COULD GET BACK IN THE FILL ALL OF OUR STATE HOUSES AND BACK IN WASHINGTON DC WITH LEADERS LIKE A LIKE LIKE CONGRESSMAN LEWIS.

WITH THAT WE WILL WITHOUT OBJECTION THE QUORUM CALL WILL NOW BE LIFTED AND REMOVED THE ADDITIONAL ADJOURNMENTS IN MEMORY. MR CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR GERMAN MEMORY. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER COLLEAGUES ON BEHALF OF SO MANY AND SAN FRANCISCO IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE HEARTBROKEN. I RISE IN THE MEMORY OF JANICE YOU'RE A TINY THE FORMER POET LAUREATE OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND THE HEART OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHO LOST TOO SOON. JANICE WAS A TEACHER AND ARTIST AND ACTIVIST. WHOSE COMMITMENT TO EMPOWERING OUR MOST VULNERABLE. LITERALLY TRANSFORMED THOUSANDS OF LIVES. BORN IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE AND STOCKTON. SHE WAS INCARCERATED WITH HER FAMILY AT AN ARKANSAS CONCENTRATION CAMP DURING THE MASS INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE AMERICANS DURING WORLD WAR TWO. UNFORTUNATELY HER LIFE REMAIN HARD AFTER SHE WAS RELEASED FROM INTERNMENT CAMP IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE. SHE MOVED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS A YOUNG GIRL. AND INJURED EMOTIONAL ISOLATION. POVERTY AND SEXUAL ABUSE. IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED SHE CHANNELED HERSELF THROUGH POETRY EVENTUALLY BECOMING OUR CITY SECOND POET LAUREATE. SHE RENDERED THE RAGE OF THE OPPRESSED THE SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVOR AND THE INVISIBLE ON TO THE PAGE WHILE ALSO EXPOSING THE RAJOY OF SPEAKING THE TRUTH. WHAT WAS SO INSPIRING ABOUT HER WAS HER UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO HELP OTHERS STRUGGLING AT THE MARGINS. TO HELP OVERCOME THEIR OWN CHALLENGES IN THE WAY THAT SHE HAD DONE FOR HERSELF. IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE SHE CAME TO WORK. AT GLIDE MEMORIAL CHURCH IN SAN FRANCISCO. BECAME ACTIVE IN THE ANTI WAR PEACE AND HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENTS. AND THAT'S WHERE SHE MET. HER FUTURE HUSBAND. THE REVEREND CECIL WILLIAMS AND HELP TO CO FOUNDED GLIDE FOUNDATION. BUILDING THE AMAZING COMMUNITY THE GLADYS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW GLIDE. IT EXEMPLIFIES THE VERY BEST OF THE VALUES OF CHRISTIAN FAITH. OF HOW WE NEED TO BE RADICALLY INCLUSIVE. JUST AND LOVING TO ALLEVIATE SUFFERING. AND BREAK THE CYCLES OF POVERTY AND MARGINALIZATION. CHANCE EXPOSURE THROUGHOUT HER LIFE TO THE INJUSTICES OF STRUCTURAL RACISM AND SEXISM PARTICULARLY AGAINST LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS PROPELLED HER ACTIVISM AND HER DETERMINATION TO PROVIDE A LOVING HOME FOR EVERYONE IN OUR CITY. THROUGHOUT HER CAREER SHE RECEIVED OVER FORTY AWARDS AND HONORS FROM EVERYONE. IT WOULD TAKE AN HOUR TO LIST THEM- BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT% HER LEGACY OF UNWAVERING ADVOCACY FOR COUNTRIES MOST MARGINALIZED INDIVIDUALS. LIVES ON IN THE CITY OF SAINT FRANCIS'S SPIRIT OF COMPASSION AND GENEROSITY. AS ONE OF THOUSANDS WHO HAVE ATTENDED RECENT SERVICES FOR HER. I CAN ASSURE YOU SHE WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED SHE WILL ALWAYS BE LOVED. SHE WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. AUSTIN POWER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SEARCHING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE GERMAN MEMORY.
