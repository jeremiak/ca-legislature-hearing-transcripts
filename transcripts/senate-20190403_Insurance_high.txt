IT'S DEFINITELY A PLEASURE TO JOIN YOU HERE TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT -- DURING MY INAUGURAL ADDRESS A REFER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOPE. I HAVE ALWAYS BROUGHT. UP BUSINESS AT THE TABLE WHEN WE MAKE POLICY AND MAKE THOSE TOUGH DECISIONS WHETHER TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF OUR IMMIGRANTS EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. TO PROTECT THEIR INSURANCE AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE A STRONG INSURANCE MARKET. I HOPE BECAUSE IT IS WHAT INSURANCE ESSENTIALLY DOES IT GIVES US THE HOPE THE PEACE OF MIND THAT COMES. WHEN KNOWING THAT INSURANCE WILL GIVE US WHAT WE NEED? TO MOVE BEYOND A LOSS AND HOPE FOR A BETTER TOMORROW FOR THOSE THAT ARE STRUGGLING. AFTER THESE RECENT FIRES -- DURING MY INAUGURAL SPEECH I ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO REESTABLISH OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE.

ANNOUNCER ON WBAL AMOUNT OF CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA -- THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS THE NATION'S LARGEST CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY. A HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DEDICATED SKILLED PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS WITH THE BUDGET OF NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION. THREE HUNDRED SWORN INVESTIGATORS AND DETECTIVES WHO INVESTIGATE INSURANCE FRAUD. AND FINANCIAL CRIMES RECOVERING OVER EIGHTY ONE MILLION IN CLAIMS AND PREMIUMS EACH YEAR THAT THAT WAS A UNIQUE THING THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE. A TREMENDOUS AND VERY. ROBUST -- DETECTIVES AND INVESTIGATORS TO INVESTIGATE -- FRAUD IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE UNFORTUNATELY GROUND ZERO FOR MANY OF THESE. CRIMES A HUNDRED COMPLIANCE OFFICERS WHO CHOOSE WHO CHOOSE -- THIS JOB. IT IS TO TAKE A OUR CONSUMER CALLS INTO OFFICE WITH ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING INSURANCE CLAIMS INSURANCE COMPANIES OR EVEN ASSIST AND FIND THE RIGHT INSURANCE PRODUCT. MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND BECAUSE EVERY YEAR FROM CONSUMERS THAT NEED THE REST THAT THEY NEED ASSISTANCE AND HAVE. SUCCEEDED IN RECOVERING MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR CONSUMERS. CALIFORNIA IS AS YOU KNOW THE LARGEST INSURANCE MARKET IN THE COUNTRY THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN PREMIUMS ANNUALLY. EIGHT BILLION. FOR HOMEOWNERS THIRTEEN BILLION FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION TWENTY SEVEN BILLION IN PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTO WITH OVER A HUNDRED AND A THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED COMPANIES. THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND AGENTS BROKERS ARE LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT I GOT TO THE NUMBERS ALREADY SO. THAT WASN'T HIMSELF AND G. -- BUT MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT IS TO PROTECT PRESERVE I PREVENT WHETHER IT'S FRAUD OR LOSS FROM DISASTERS LINKED TO CLIMATE CHANGE OUR SENIORS PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. ARE TARGETS OF CON ARTIST AND SCAMS ARE UNDERPINNED WARS FACE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY MILLIONS OF US LIVE ONE EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT AWAY FROM FINANCIAL RUIN UNFORTUNATELY. AS I LOOK AT THESE ISSUES WE FACE I BELIEVE HOPE IS -- NOW MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. AND WE'VE BEEN BUSY THUS FAR SINCE JANUARY I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT OUR STAFF HAVE HELPED HELD WORKSHOPS AND SHE GOING TO GORE HILLS. THEY GAVE -- IN PERSON ONE ON ONE SESSIONS TO HELP OVER SIX HUNDRED WELL FIR SURVIVORS WE'VE HELPED OVER TWO HUNDRED SURVIVORS THROUGH ARE CONSUMER HOTLINES. AND OUR STAFF ALSO ASSISTANT AFTER HE MERELY AFTER THE RUSSIAN RIVER FLOODS AND SERVED IN OUR LOCAL ASSISTANCE CENTER IN GRANVILLE SO WE ARE TRYING TO GET -- TO THESE DISASTER AREAS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO ASSIST FOLKS ONE OF THE THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE'RE SEEING IS WELL FOLKS ARE MAKING VERY VERY IMPORTANT DECISIONS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER A DISASTER AND THEY'RE DOING I'M UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF GREAT STRESS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ABLE. TO GIVE THEM THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION SO THAT THEY CAN BEST MAKE THE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THERE'S NO QUESTION UNDER OUR SATE HAS BEEN SCORCHED BY WILDFIRES FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS LEAVING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS HOMELESS AND FACING A LONG DIFFICULT ROAD. AS THEY WORK TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES AND THEIR HOMES -- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY AND THE AVAILABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE ESPECIALLY IN A HIGH RISK WELFARE AREAS AS MANY OF YOU. CLIMATE CHANGE HAS A IS HAVING A DRAMATIC EFFECT ON ENVIRONMENT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR WAY OF LIFE. AS LONG AS DAHLE CYCLES CREATE WILDFIRE FEEL AND SEE LEVELS. LEVEL RISE LEADING TO RECORD FLOODS ACROSS OUR NATION. THE PRESSURE ON INSURERS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AS IS ASTERS RELATED -- AMOUNT TO MORE MORE LOSSES THAT IS WHY MY FIRST DAY AS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF A DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF CLIMATE AND SUSTAINABILITY. A FIRST FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND INDUSTRY LEADERS ON INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR INNOVATIVE -- SOLUTION ONE OF THE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT I'M PROUD TO PROMOTE WITH SENATOR BILL DODD IS A CALIFORNIA DISASTER INSURANCE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A KIND OF STRONG. CONSERVE FIX INSURANCE PROTECTION PLAN THAT PAYS OUT WHEN UNEXPECTED COSTS OF DISASTERS RESPOND IT'S A MUCH BETTER WAY WE BELIEVE -- TO HANDLE OUR WELFARE FUNDS A MUCH SMARTER WAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO IDENTIFYING HOW DO WE NOT ONLY MITIGATE BUT CONTINUE TO PUT MONEY ASIDE. AS WE CONTINUE TO FACE THESE FIRES. BASED ON LEGISLATION FROM -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE ARE GONNA BE IT COMPLETING A GROUP MADE OF MEMBERS REPRESENTING. THE INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS TO GIVE US MORE IDEAS OF HOW DO WE CREATE MARKET BASED MECHANISMS TO HELP US ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR GOALS ARE TO LOOK AT PROACTIVE RISK TRANSFER MECHANISMS THAT REDUCE FUTURE RESTS FOR COMMUNITIES. THE INSPIRATION OF THE GRASS OF THIS GROUP COMES FROM INNOVATIVE INSURANCE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING KUNKEL MEXICO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS LOCAL BUSINESSES AND WE INSURANCE COMPANIES. ARE COLLABORATED TO DESIGN AN INSURANCE PRODUCT FOR THE CORAL EEF -- THIS ROOF IS THAT PROTECT NOT ONLY PROTECTIVE TO THE COMMUNITY BUT PROTECTING THE LOCAL ECONOMY WHEN A LARGE STORM HITS THEY CAN. ASSESS THE DAMAGE OF THE REEF AND WHICH OBVIOUSLY LEAVES A COMMUNITY EXPOSED TO THE NEXT STORM THIS INNOVATIVE INSURANCE POLICY PROVIDES A WAY FOR RESTORING THE REEF WITHOUT STRAINING THE GENERAL FUND AFTER A STORM. THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE INSURANCE A WORKING GROUP WILL BE ASKING ARE THERE. CALIFORNIA AND WHAT IT WHAT WOULD BE ANALOGOUS TO CALIFORNIA ESSENTIALLY WE'RE SEEING THIS. COULD BE OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES ARE FOREST OUR WETLANDS AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO TRYING TO ADDRESS. HOW DO WE FIRST PROTECT OUR NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE TO PROTECT IN A WAY WHERE WILL BE MUCH MORE SMART WITH OUR MONEY? I'M ALSO PROUD TO BE A MEMBER. OF THE GOVERNOR'S STRIKE TEAM THAT MEETS WEEKLY AND PARTNER WITH THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION HOW TO PREPARE FOR CONTINUED WILDFIRES. I HAVE ASKED LEADERS IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO JOIN ME IN THE FIGHT AGAINST EXTREME DISASTERS LINK TO CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED A BOLD ACTION TO ENSURE COMMUNITIES ADAPT AND A RESILIENT. THERE IS NO OTHER INDUSTRY THAT HAS THE NECESSARY EXPERTISE TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS PREPARED TO MITIGATE REDUCE REST FOR COMMUNITIES THE ENVIRONMENT. AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. OF COURSE I CANNOT BE HERE WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT HEALTHCARE. IN THE WORLD OF HEALTH CARE THE NATIONAL BATTLES ARE DRAWN OVER FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE HIGH COST OF HEALTH CARE INSURANCE AND INCREASING COST. TO PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE SAID THOUSANDS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. I AM GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S PARTNER IN HIS SHARED VISION FOR A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. I JOIN MANY OTHERS IN TAKING A STAND AGAINST THIS SAID CURRENT FEDERAL MINISTRATION. AS USE OF REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO UNDERMINE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THEIR ACTIONS THAT MAKE. HEALTH INSURANCE. COVERAGE LESS AFFORDABLE LIMIT BENEFITS AND COVERAGE AND REALLY CHIP AWAY OF THE AXIS OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. I'M ON THE SIDE OF INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AS YOU KNOW THE WORK THAT I'VE DONE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THAT. REDUCE THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS COVERING MORE PEOPLE INCLUDING ARE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS TWO BROUGHT IN THE RISK POOL. INCREASING SUBSIDIES FOR WORKING PEOPLE AFFORD TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE. INNOVATION INNOVATION IS KEY AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS WE COME FROM FRAUD AND CLIMATE CHANGE KEEPING A STRONG MARKET PLACE IS ALSO OUR TOP PRIORITY. CALIFORNIA'S NEED A COMPETITOR NEED COMPETITION AND CHOICE TO KEEP RATES LOW AND GIVE YOU MORE OPTIONS FOR COVERAGE. I'M A TO Z. ASK ABOUT THE PROMISE OF WHAT TECHNOLOGY CAN BRING TO THE INSURANCE MARKET PLACE WE NEED TO EMBRACE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE ACCESS AFFORDABILITY. PROTECTING PRIVACY AND ALLOWING INNOVATION TO TRANSFORM THIS INDUSTRY. IN MY IN MY VIEW THE AGE OF INSURANCE INNOVATION HAS ARRIVED THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY APPROVED A NUMBER OF INNOVATIVE INSURNCE PRODUCTS INCLUDING ONE FOR AUTO INSURANCE ANOTHER FOR LIFE. TODAY CONSUMERS CAN FILL IN MANAGER CLAIM ONLINE THING THEM TIME. AND ENSURE TIME AND MONEY AS WELL CLEARLY THE TIME HAS COME FOR CONSUMERS TO CONDUCT MORE INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS ONLINE. IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE YOUR PROOF OF INSURANCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGH AN APP ON YOUR PHONE WITH CONFIDENCE THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SECURE. A CONSUMER CAN USE THEIR SMARTPHONE TO CHECK IF THEIR PROFESSIONAL THEY'RE HIRING HAS A VALID WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE. INNOVATIVE INSURANCE PRODUCTS WILL ALSO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES TO STREAMLINE THEIR OPPORTUNITY THE OPERATION AND LOWER THE COST THAT WE OF ONLY STARTED TO EXPLORE. AGAIN THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT ARE NEW TO WEST WE FEEL WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN UP SOME PART OF OUR MARKET TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW FOR THIS INNOVATION TO HAPPEN. CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE LEADING AN INNOVATION AND NOT WAITING FOR OTHER STATES AS IT COMES TO IN A MEETING INCREASING -- NEW PRODUCTS IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY A AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO ALLOW THESE INNOVATIONS. THAT HELP US DISRUPTIVE YOU KNOW CAN A JGGERNAUT OF AN AND OF INDUSTRY. WHICH WE KNOW WOULD GIVE CONSUMERS BETTER OPTIONS MORE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS PROTECT THEIR PRIVACY AND GIVE US MORE OPTIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- AGAIN ONE OF STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GOVERNING BOARD EVER CITIES AND OUR INSURANCE MARKET WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN A COURSE THE DEPARTMENT CURRENT SUPPLIER DIVERSITY SURVEY ASKS INSURERS HOW MUCH THEY SPENDING CONTRACTS AND DIVERSE BUSINESSES A SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRACK. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN INCHES COMPANIES REPORTED SPENDING ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION WITH CALIFORNIA DIVERSE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES WE WANT TO CONTINUE. TO EXPAND ON THIS PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA LOW COST AUTO INSURANCE PROGRAM AND THANK YOU -- CHAIRWOMAN RUBIO -- WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA LOW COST AUTO INSURANCE PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY NINE CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES ALL DRIVERS AND OWNERS OF VEHICLES WITHIN THE STATE TO MEET -- AND MAINTAIN FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN ORDER TO DRIVE UP OR REGISTER THE CAR MOST DRIVERS THE VEHICLE OWNERS MEET THIS REQUIREMENT BY CARING LIABILITY INSURANCE. COVERAGE OF AT LEAST FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON IN CASE OF A BODILY INJURY OR DEATH UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND PER ACCIDENT AND FIVE THOUSAND FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE. FOR QUALIFIED LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS CALIFORNIA'S LOW COST AUTO INSURANCE PROGRAM HAS EXISTED TO HELP OUR DOUBLE BORDER A MEET THE STATE'S FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS. AT AFFORDABLE RATES ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND DRIVERS ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN THE LOW COST AUTO INSURANCE PROGRAM AND OVER A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND CONSUMERS. HAVE BEEN SERVED BY THE PROGRAM SINCE ITS INCEPTION. MANY VULNERABLE KINDS -- CONSUMERS DEPEND ON THIS PROGRAM FOR COVERAGE SO THAT THEY MAY GO TO WORK TRY THEIR CHILDREN'S SCHOOL OTHERWISE WITHOUT THE PROGRAM THERE MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO REGISTER. AND LAWFULLY DRIVE THEIR VEHICLES SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE CHAIR WOMAN TO ADDRESS THESE UNIQUE ADVANTAGES AND JUST IN CLOSING. I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA RAMP UP OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS -- WE ARE HIRING MORE FLKS TO MAKE XIN ONLY WE RAMP UP ON OUR OUTREACH BUT THAT WE COORDINATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE A LOT MORE. THAT WE UTILIZE OUR DISTRICT OFFICES AS A WAY TO NOT ONLY TALK ABOUT THE THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO FRAUD AND IF FOLKS FEEL THAT THE VICTIMS OF FRAUD THAT WE ASSESS THEM THAT WE ARE ABLE TO GET BACK TO ME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WELL FORTUNATELY AGAIN CALIFORNIA IS GROUND ZERO TO THIS OUR SENIORS. ARE MONOLINGUAL IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO BE VICTIMIZED AND SO WE WANT TO UTILIZE YOU ARE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH US. AS WE CONTINUE TO LEAD THESE OUTREACH EFFORTS AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE IN THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THESE WILDFIRES BY THESE MUD SLIDES -- TO CONTINUE LET THEM KNOW THAT WE ARE THERE TO HELP THEM TO MAKE THEM. COMFORTABLE WITH THE DECISIONS ARE MAKING AGAIN THESE ARE ISSUES AS I'VE SEEN NOW AFTER THREE OF THESE -- OUT REACH HEARINGS AND WORKSHOPS AGAIN PEOPLE ARE MAKING VERY TOUGH DECISIONS UNDER VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES -- I HAVE TO SAY WHAT ONE THING WE DID IN TERMS OF BEING CREATIVE AS WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED CARE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR A LOT OF THESE FOLKS. A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE BEEN HAVING IS HOW DO I TALK TO MY CHILD. HOW DO I ASSIST MY CHILDREN THAT CAN NO LONGER SLEEP AT NIGHT BECAUSE ARE AFRAID THAT ANOTHER FIRE OR IMPENDING DISASTER MY COMP? THESE ARE ALL UNIQUE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS AS WE HELP CALIFORNIANS REBUILD AND NOT ONLY HOW TO WE PROTECT THEM HOW DO WE MITIGATE FROM FUTURE. DISASTERS AND THEN ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY CHOOSE TO LIVE BACK IN SO. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS IS A AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S BEEN A VERY CHALLENGING NINETY DAYS BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT. IS IMPORTANT FOR US AS WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HELP HELP THEM REBUILD AND SO I'M GONNA LOOK TO YOU ALL AGAIN TO YOUR IDEAS. ARE LOOK FOR TO ENGAGE THE LEGISLATURE -- IN A WAY THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES FOR CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU FOR TIME. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU I KNOW THAT YOUR TIME IS VERY LIMITED IN YOUR BUSY GOING UP AND DOWN THE STATE SO WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO COME -- I HAVE A A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU FIRST RIGHT NOW THAT YOU MENTION YOUR PART OF THE STRIKE TEAM FOR THE GOVERNOR. IS THERE -- CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT ARE LIKE THE TOP ISSUES YOU'RE DISCUSSING AND IS THERE A TIME LINE IN TERMS OF COMING UP WITH SOLUTIONS ARE IS IS GONNA BE AN ON GOING -- TEAM. SO WE DEFINITELY SEE THIS WELL THERE'S MULTIPLE FACETS TO THE STRIKE TEAM RIGHT WE WOULD LOOK AT THERE'S A GROUP LOOKING AT THE UTILITIES. I'M WORKING ON THE INSURANCE SIDE UP ON THE INSURANCE SIDE WE'RE LOOKING AT AFFORDABILITY. AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE UP REALLY HAVING AN HONEST DIALOGUE ABOUT. HOW ARE WE GONNA MOVE FORWARD WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FUTURE LAND USE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES? AND THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO COME UP WITH SOME INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS WHEN IT COMES. TO INSURING THAT WE HAVE AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE BUT YOU'RE CLEAR ARE FOLKS WHO ARE IN THIS URBAN WILDLIFE INTERFACE. AND SO THESE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAVING OF COURSE IS TO BE ONGOING WE ARE GOING TO BE RELEASING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS -- AND THEN APPROACHING YOU ARE AS NEW FORWARD WITH POSSIBLE LEGISLATION OR WORKING IN THE BUDGET. TO GET US TO A POINT WHERE -- WE'RE WORKING ON THESE CRITICAL ISSUES ANOTHER BIG ISSUE IS. FOLKS MAY NOT MAY MAY HAVE INSURANCE BUT THEY'RE COMPLETELY UNDERINSURED HOW DO WE GET OUT THERE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH CONSUMERS I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU'RE BUYING YOUR FIRST HOME -- THE AGENT WANTS TO MAKE A SALE YOU NEED TO BUY THE INSURANCE YOU NEED. BUT I WILL POINT TO WE COMMUNICATE WITH -- THE CONSUMER THAT THERE STILL MAY BE UNDER INSURED SHOULD A CATASTROPHE HAPPEN WHAT YOU GOING TO BE COVERED FOR AND QUITE FRANKLY LOOKING AT THE IDEA OF HOW DO WE TALK TO OUR CALIFORNIANS ABOUT. REVISITING THEIR POLICIES HOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN YOUR POLICY AND YOU KNOW I JUST DID THIS WITH MY OWN PARENTS AND THE HESITATION FOR THEM TO EVEN BRING OUT THE DOCUMENTS. TO GO OVER ALL THESE YOU KNOW PAGES ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY IN THE POLICY IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT DEPARTMENT HOW DO WE STREAMLINE STREAMLINE THIS. HOW DO WE PUT THIS IN BASIC ENGLISH FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS ANOTHER WAY THAT WE'RE PUSHING? ON THE DEPARTMENT -- HELPLESS STREAMLINED THESE DOCUMENTS HOW CAN WE USE TECHNOLOGY TO MODERNIZE -- THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING OUT THERE AND THEN HOW DO WE HOW THE CONVERSATION. WITH CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT HOW DO YOU RE VISIT YOUR POLICY. TRY TO TAKE AWAY THE STIGMA OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS WE'VE HEARD YOU KNOW I PAY MY POLICY AND I AM ASSUMING I'M COVERED I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT EVER AGAIN. WE TWO HUNDRED TO IS TO FIND THAT AND AND BRING THEM BACK TO REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE COVERED AND WHAT THEY SHOULD BE. EXPECTING GIVEN IN THE OF FROM COMMUNITY. ELEVEN THANK YOU FOR THAT WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR REAP A PLACING FOCUS ON PORTABLE COMMUNITIES AS YOU MENTION YOUR PARENTS. YOU KNOW MY PARENTS HE YOU HAPPEN TO FORMALLY REPRESENT THEM -- BUT THANK YOU FOR FOR FOCUSING ON THAT AND IT IS SAW SOMETHING THAT DOUBT OUR EXPOSURE LATINO COMMUNITY DEALS WITH THE OR THEY'RE AFRAID OF PAPERWORK. THEY DON'T UNDERSTANDING SO THANK YOU FOR MAKING OUT OF FOCUS -- I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION IN TERMS OF OUR CHANGING INDUSTRIES -- I'M CURIOUS OF WHAT IS A CONVERSATION ABOUT CANNABIS I KNOW THAT WE HAVE COVERAGE FOR EVERYTHING AND BEING THAT IT'S A NEW INDUSTRY HOW DO YOU QUANTIFY AND HOW DO YOU ENSURE CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT DISCUSSIONS WERE HAVING AROUND THAT. ABSOLUTELY THIS IS. A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THAT WE BEGAN TO HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO HOW DO WE ENSURE. OUR CANNABIS INDUSTRY EVERYTHING FROM PRODUCT LIABILITY WORKERS COMPENSATION YOU NAME IT -- THEY NEED INSURANCE PRODUCTS TO BE ABLE TO AGAIN ENSURE THEIR THEIR PRODUCT THERE THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HAVE ENTERED. INTO THE THIS INDUSTRY THE NUMBER ONE PUSH BACK THAT I'M GETTING AS I'M HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH YOU KNOW THE THE BIG INSURANCE COMPANIES. ARE THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THE TRANSACTIONS ARE STILL BEING DONE IN CASH. AND THAT WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO BANK THIS IS WHY WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR STATE TREASURER TO FIGURE OUT WAYS HOW WE BANK THE INDUSTRY SO THAT IT COULD BE EASIER FOR THEM. TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE PAYMENTS TO GET THE INSURANCE THEY NEED -- WHAT OUT THERE -- TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE I ACTUALLY LEAD TO WORK. FOR THE TASK FORCE AROUND THIS AT THE NATIONAL INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS ASSOCIATION WE'RE GONNA BE MEETING AND A COUPLE DAYS AS YOU KNOW IN ORLANDO -- TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS AGAIN AROUND THE COUNTRY HOW DO WE WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR THOSE STATES THAT HAVE READY PASSED THE THESE INITIATIVES. TO ALLOW US TO BANK -- THE THE THE PROFITS AND SALES OF OF THIS INDUSTRY SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE PROPER APPROPRIATE INSURANCE THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO RUN A BUSINESS SOLD. OUT IT IS A MAJOR ISSUE IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M LEADING AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. TO OUR OUTREACH TO NOT ONLY OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS BUT WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS AS WE CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE GET THIS INDUSTRY BACKED. THANK YOU FOR THAT JUST -- YOU KNOW WHENEVER YOU GET INFORMATION MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE SEEN AS YOU CAN I KNOW WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF QUESTIONS ARE CONCERNING THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. SENATOR DODD COMMISSIONER -- CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WORK AND PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU ON OUR OUR BILL GOING. FOR YOU KNOW -- I'M SEEING IN MY DISTRICT -- A LOT OF INSURANCE POLICIES THAT -- YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY. WHAT THROUGHOUT SADDAM OF OUR FOR EXAMPLE SNOWMEN SNOW VALLEY ARE JUST ARBITRARILY BEING CANCELED? NOW WE CAN UNDERSTAND AND I'VE TALKED TO SOME INSURANCE PEOPLE SOMETIMES INSURANCE COMPANIES OR OVER WAITED. IN TERMS OF THE THE AMOUNT OF POLICIES THEY HAVE AN FIRESTONE'S VERSUS. YOU KNOW PERHAPS URBAN AREAS I GET THAT. BUT I GUESS -- YOUR MIGHT MY QUESTION IS THAT I I I'VE. I WONDER IF YOUR OFFICE COULD CHECK INTO THIS. BECAUSE UNLIKE OTHER AREAS WHEN THEY DO A BY ZIP CODE. YEAH THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE LIKE ONE ZIP CODE AND IT'S EVERYBODY. IN IT DOESN'T REALLY. ACCOUNT -- FOR PROPERTIES THAT HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE LOTS OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE WE TOURED A COUPLE THOSE HOMES THAT -- YOU HAVE LIKE ACRES AND ACRES AND ACRES OF VINEYARDS AROUND THEM AND WEREN'T BURNED BECAUSE THE VINEYARDS. BUTTON YOU'RE NOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE FAIR PLAN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET ANYBODY. TO ENSURE THAT MEANT SO I I GUESS I WONDER. IF INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT HAVE THESE TYPE OF PRACTICES THAT. NOT BY MY REVIEW BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER REVIEW SHOULD BE ALLOWED. TO I TAKE ALL THE THE CREAM THE TO THE URBAN AREAS THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE FIRES THAT -- YEAH WE HAVE SO I GET RISK I GET THE FACT THAT -- THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO INCREASE RATES IF IF THE REST WERE HIGHER BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT AND WHAT WE DO GOING FORWARD. FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY WORKING HARD TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE REST FOR THAT THEIR THEMSELVES IN THE COMPANY ABSOLUTELY SENATOR OF C. RIGHT WE'RE SEEING AN UPTICK IN OUR RENEWALS. AND PARTICULARLY IN THESE THESE IN HIGH RISK AREAS IT IS PART OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING THAT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. IN TERMS OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS I WILL BE éEASING FEEL THAT LOOK WE NEED TO EVEN LET'S BE HONEST EVEN THE FAIR PLAN IS NOT GONNA BE AFFORDABLE FOR A LOT OF THESE FOLKS. AND SO THE NEED FOR US TO CREATE ADDITIONAL OUR PRODUCTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE THERE ARE GONNA BE CREATIVE IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE ARE NOT ONLY. WORK WITH THE LOCAL CITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CITIES HAVE A CITY WIDE -- PROGRAM IN TERMS OF HOW DO THEY CREATE MARIA DEFENSIBLE SPACE BUT WHAT REALLY PRIORITIZE IN TERMS OF HOW WE MANAGE THEIR OWN RISK. SO THAT MOVING FORWARD -- WE GET TO A POINT WHERE IT'S NOT ONLY US WORKING WITH THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS BUT THE CITY AS WELL AS THE ACTUAL PLAN -- WE ARE WE ARE HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS AGAIN WE NEED TALKS ARE ACTUALLY ALSO. HAVE THAT ON HIS CONVERSATION ABOUT LAND USE. AND AND THAT RESPOND WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THAT AND MAKING SURE THAT. WHEN WE REBUILD WE REBUILD IN A WAY THAT'S MUCH MORE REASONS IT MUCH MORE RESILIENT? AND THAT IS NOT GONNA CERTAINLY YOU KNOW OUR BE OVERLY EXPENSIVE WERE PUT FOLKS ARE NOT GONNA BE ABLE. TO TO REBUILD BACK IN THE COMMUNITIES SO THESE ARE THE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS WERE HAVING WITH THE STRIKE TEAM WE ARE GOING TO BE ENGAGING THE INSURANCE COMPANIES -- WE WANT THEM TO COME WHAT THEIR SOLUTIONS AS WELL ON WHAT THEIR IDEAS WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING THAT MEETING VERY SHORTLY -- BUT YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE KNOW THAT FOR A LOT OF OUR VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS. THE CURRENT MODELS AND CURRENT PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE. I'M NOT GONNA BE AFFORDABLE. AND SO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT AND WE WOULD FIRST ONE ENGAGE THE INDUSTRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IDEAS THEY HAVE. AND THEN WORK WITH THEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION HAS TO BE MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE WHEN IT COMES. TO CITY LAND USE ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THE INSURANCE PRODUCTS CURRENTLY ARE THAT WE HAVE. AND HOW DO WE WORK ON INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND WHEN I SAY INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS OUR PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO HELP US ADDRESS. THE NEED OF PROVIDING INSURANCE IN THESE COMMUNITIES ARE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS. ARE YOU SEEING FOLKS THAT HAVE PARTIAL LOSSES. WHO ARE LIKE TELLING US WORK LOOK? NOW I HAVE A PROPERTY HERE THAT I'M NOT ONLY NOT COULD BE WILL ENSURE. THAT NOW IS A DROP IN PROPERTY VALUE AND NOW THAT I'M STUCK WITH. AS OPPOSED TO FOLKS THAT HAVE TOTAL LOSSES WHO CAN TAKE THEIR AND I'M SURE YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE SEEING THIS. TAKE THEIR THEIR CLAIM MONEY AND MOVE OUT OF THE COMMUNITY RIGHT AND SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PLOTS OF LAND THAT ARE NOW BEING SOLD. AT A MUCH LOWER RATE AND PEOPLE ARE COMING IN BUYING THEM TO THREE AT A TIME. TO REBUILD A BIGGER HOUSE RIGHT SO WE'RE SEEING THIS PHENOMENON HAPPEN IN SANTA ROSA WERE WE'RE MONITORING IT IN IN PARADISE -- BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT WERE COMES IS THAT WE'RE HAVING I JUST WANT YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE HAVING THOSE DIALOGUES ONCE WE COME UP WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WE'RE GONNA COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. PRESENT ON THOSE AND THEN HAVE A MORE ROBUST CONVERSATION. THE THE OTHER POINT IS IS BECAUSE THIS DIFFICULT SITUATION RIGHT IN THE CITY IT'S SINAMA. THREE DOORS DOWN. FROM THE FIRE STATION. RIGHT COULD NOT GET A RENEWAL SO I MEAN I I DON'T KNOW I YOU KNOW THAT THEIR I APPRECIATE THE THE OTHER COMMENTS THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT ZOODLES ALL TO THE DISCUSSIONS YOU'RE HAVING. THANK YOU YOUR THANK YOU A SENATOR BURGESS. THANK CHAIRMAN ARM I THINK SENATOR DODD PRESENTED TO A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I WAS GOING TO PRESENT TO YOU BUT ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENING COMMENTS. I THINK MAYBE JUST TO JUST TO ADD ON A LITTLE BIT. I REPRESENT -- DISTRICT EIGHT AND THAT'S WHEN THOSE VERY LARGE DISTRICTS FROM DEATH VALLEY TO SACRAMENTO TO INCLUDES A LOT OF THOSE -- RURAL MOUNTAIN AND FOOT HILL AREAS -- SO YOU CAN IMAGINE -- THE THE THE DIFFICULTY AS IT PERTAINS TO FIRE SO I HAD A COMMITTEE MEETING -- A COUPLE OF MONTHS BACK IN -- TWELVE MY COUNTY AND OF FOLKS THAT ATTENDED WERE ASKING ME OBVIOUSLY ABOUT INSURANCE RELATED ISSUES. AND WHAT THEY TOLD ME WAS. THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET. OUR INSURANCE. EXCEPT FOR ONE ENTITY LLOYDS OF LONDON IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY NO DOMESTIC -- CALIFORNIA ENTITY -- WAS WAS WAS PREPARED TO TO TOUCH THEM THEN SOMEONE BROUGHT OUT IN IN MADE AN ANALOGY -- BACK WHEN WE HAD -- THE MANDATORY FLOOD AND EARTHQUAKE AVAILABILITY -- ARE YOU SEEING IT GOING IN THAT DIRECTION THAT. IT THAT INDUSTRY THAT THE FOLKS IN THE INDUSTRY WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE. COVERAGE IT IS WHETHER OR NOT THE PREMIUMS ARE GOING TO BE -- REASONABLE. RIGHT SENATOR WE WE WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT. THERE YET WHEN CRAFTED MANDATORY INSURANCE I I JUST WANNA REMIND. THE COMMITTEE THAT WE AT TO THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. AND WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING IS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY PULLED OUT. OF EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE. LEAVING US WITH THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. AND AND A POINT WHERE WE ONLY I THINK WE'RE UP 211% OF TAKE IN TERMS OF THIS PRODUCT. SO WE'RE GONNA BE IN DIRE STRAITS AND WHEN WE HAVE THE NEXT BIG EARTHQUAKE. SO WE DON'T WANT TO GET TO THAT POINT THIS IS WHY. WE'RE ENGAGING INDUSTRY TO BRING THEIR SOLUTIONS BRING THEIR IDEAS ABOUT HOW DO WE PROVIDE. AFFORDABLE INSURANCE IN THESE HIGH RISK AREA. AND WE'RE HAVING THOSE DIALOGUES-NOW. WE'RE HAVING A PART OF THE STRIKE TEAM PART OF OF OUR SUBCOMMITTEE. THAT WE FEEL THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE FACT IS CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST. INSURANCE MARKET IN THE COUNTRY SHORT OF THEM ALL PULLING OUT OF THE LARGEST MARKET AND QUITE FRANKLY THE ENTIRE WESTERN. COAST OF THE WESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE WE'RE SEEING THESE FIRES CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO COME AT THE TABLE AND ACTUALLY PUT SOME SKIN IN THE GAME WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE.

IS THIS YOUR CELEBRATING ITS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY WE WERE CREATED BY STATUTE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE SO THIS IS FIFTY YEARS OF SERVICE. TO THE CITIZENS AND CONSUMERS OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY DEDICATED INSURANCE PROFESSIONALS THE WORK WITH ME IN ONE DALE WHO HANDLE CLAIMS FOR THESE FOLKS THAT -- THAT HAVE WHAT INSURANCE FROM THE WRONG CARRIER. WE HAVE -- TODAY ABOUT A A NEARLY EVEN MIX OF CLAIMS BETWEEN WORKERS COMPENSATION AND AUTO HOMEOWNER AND LIABILITY CLAIMS. WITH ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WORK COMP CLAIMS AND ABOUTSOME MORE NORTH THE THIRTEEN THOUSAND AUTO AND HOMEOWNERS CLAIMS. WE ARE THE LARGEST GUARANTEE FUND IN THE U. S. LIKE A LOT OF THINGS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE LARGEST AND AND WE LOOK LIKE TO BELIEVE WE'RETHE BEST THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION OF ALL OF THE GUARANTEE FUNDS AROUND THE COUNTRY SIMILARLY SITUATED SITUATED. TO CALIFORNIA WE ARE AND WHAT THE LARGEST IN THAT ORGANIZATION AND WE ARE ALSO ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE NATIONAL OGANIZATION OF FUNDS AS WELL -- I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT KIND OF THE HISTORY OF CLAIMS -- AT THE AT THE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION FOR PROPER PROPERTY CASUALLY PERSPECTIVE IN THE LATE SIXTIES EARLY SEVENTIES IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN THE GURNEY FUNDS WERE ESTABLISHED. MOST FOLKS WERE THINKING ABOUT NONSTANDARD AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANIES'S WHERE THE WHERE THE ACTION WOULD COME. FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM AND FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES THAT WAS THE CASE. OVER THE COURSE OF TIME WE REALLY MORPHED INTO WE BEING ALL THE GURNEY FUNDS AND HANDLING MOSTLY WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS. THERE WAS A A CRISIS OF SORTS HEARING CALIFORNIANSLONG PRO PRECEDED MY TIME HERE -- BUT IN THE LATE THE IN THE LATE NINETIES THE MARKET SHIFTED IN AND THE YEARS TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND AND ONE THERE WERE TWENTY SIX INSOLVENCY IS A WORKERS COMPENSATION COMPANIES. PART OF THAT TIME. US A GOOD CARRIED ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND CLAIMS AND WE PAID ABOUT WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS IN THEIR PAY AND ARE PENDING. AT ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS TO INJURED WORKERS. TO THE TWENTY SIX INSOLVENCY CLIMB COG JUMPED FROM FIVE THOUSAND CLAIMS TO OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CLAIMS. SIGO WENT FROM PAYING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN BENEFITS TO INJURED WORKERS. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH. AND SO THEY CREATED A A CRISIS OF SORTS FROM AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE WE RELY ON DOLLARS COMING FROM IN SOLVING THE STATE'S AND FROM ASSESSMENTS TO ACTIVE INSURERS IN ORDER TO FUND. THESE PLANS OF THOSE THOSE ARE SOURCES OF REVENUE. I'M IN THE MIDDLE TO THOUSANDS -- THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY CALL PLACE TO THEN GOVERNOR -- GARAMENDI WHO HELPED US TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATUTE SO THAT WE COULD CONTINUE TO FIND CLAIMS. THROUGH THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME ECOND NEVER MISSED A PAYMENT TO AN INJURED WORKER. AND WE NEVER -- NEVER FAILED -- TO EXERCISE OUR RESPONSIBILITY -- THERE WAS A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS IN THE IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS. THROUGH A SERIES OF INCEST OF ASSESSMENTS AND A CHANGE IN OUR STATUTE WHICH ALLOWED US TO ISSUE BONDS. WE WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PAY CLAIMS AND TODAY WE EXPENSIVE -- WE EXPERIENCE -- ENJOY -- HEALTHY SURPLUS AND OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION ACCOUNT WE BELIEVE FROM AN ACTUAL ORAL PERSPECTIVE THAT GIVEN NO NEW INSOLVENCY AS WE HAVE PLENTY OF FUNDS TO BE ABLE -- TO TO BILL HANDEL ALL OF OUR FUTURE OBLIGATIONS -- CIGNA ASSESSED WORKERS COMPENSATION CARRIERS FROM THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS UP UNTIL TWO THREE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE DID NOT HAVE AN ASSESSMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE AN ASSESSMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN FOR THE WORKERS COMPENSATION ACT NOW. IN ADDITION TO WORKERS COMPENSATION WE ALSO HANDLE AUTO AND HOMEOWNERS AND ALL ANY OTHER KIND OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY CLAIMS. AND THE IRONICALLY AFTER A LONG% PERIOD OF TIME A FAMILY WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIM THE LAST THREE IN SOLVENT SEAS OF SORT OF GONE BACK TO THE ROOTS OF THAT TO NON STANDARD AUTO INSURANCE CARRIERS THAT HAVE BECOME INSOLVENT -- ONE OF THEM IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH PRESENTED US WITH FIVE THOUSAND CLAIMS TODAY -- THAT -- STATES THAT'S WITH JUST A HUNDRED OPEN CLAIM SO WE VIRTUALLY RETIRED ALL OF THOSE CLAIMS IN A COUPLE YEARS -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE RECEIVED A VERY LARGE NONSTANDARD AUTOMOBILE INSOLVENCY WITH NEARLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CLAIMS IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THAT WE RETIRED HALF OF THOSE CLAIMS SO WITH CLOSE THOSE CLAIMS AND FOLKS HAVE MOVED AROUND ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS. AND SO WE HAVE ABOUT TWELVE AND A HALF THOUSAND OF THOSE CLAIMS LEFT -- IN DECEMBER OF OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THE MERCED PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COMPANY WAS DECLARED INSOLVENT. AS A RESULT OF THE CAMPFIRE UP IN PARADISE AND MCGILL YEAH. AND WE TOOK ON THAT OBLIGATION -- THE THE THE ORDER OF INSOLVENCY WAS GIVEN ON MONDAY DECEMBER THIRD IN THE AFTERNOON WE WERE WRITING CHECKS TO THOSE -- THOSE FOLKS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES THAT FRIDAY. THOSE ONE OF THE FINEST TURNAROUNDS THAT THE ORGANIZATION IS SEEN IN ITS HISTORY OF BEING ABLE TO GET ON TOP OF IT AND TAKE CARE OF THOSE FOLKS. AND REALLY GET IN THE GAP FOR THEM. SO IF THE CLOTHES MANAGER WOMAN YOU KNOW WE EXIST SOLELY TO SERVE CONSUMERS WHO HAVE NO OTHER PLACE TO GO -- WE BELIEVE IT'S A NOBLE MISSION AND AND I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT WE DO AS ARE ALL OF OUR FOLKS SO. THAT'S THE STORY OF SEGA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT TESTIMONY. YEAH GOOD MORNING -- WOMAN RUBIO AND MEMBERS COMMITTEE ON TOP ACTOR AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT TESTIMONY. I'M I'M A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST EXPRESS I BELIEVE YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE SHIFTING TWENTY MODEL. AND THE CAPACITY I DO UNDERLING I BELIEVE YOU SAID THE CAPACITY STARTED AT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE MILLION AND IT'S GONE DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE MILLION IS NOT ACCURATE. YES. MADAM CHAIRMAN IF YOU LOOK AT OURS [inaudible] SINGLE YEAR. BEING WE HAVE PASSED ON TO HELP OUT. THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION AND THIS YEAR IT'S DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED NINETY TWO MILLION. THE ONLY EXPLANATION FOR THAT IS. MEMBER COMPANIES MOVING THEIR BUSINESS FROM THEIR DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED. SO HOW DO YOU SEE SOME. THAT AFFECTING US IN THE FUTURE THAT SEEMS TO BE A REAL PROBLEM IF IT CONTINUES TO SHRINK SO. WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS AND WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT? IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AT DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE ANY I SEE. ARE MADE SOME CHANGES TO THAT LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION MODEL ACT. AND TO THOSE CHANGES I THINK ARE RELEVANT -- ONE DAY IF THEY MODIFIED THE DEFINITION OF A HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN. TO INCLUDE A TEMAS. AND THE SECOND THING THAT THEY DID IS THEY CHANGE THEIR FUTURE LONG TERM CARE ASSESSMENT LIABILITY. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA A LONG TERM CARE COMPANY IS. IN THE HELP LINE. AND SO PER PANTRY WHICH WAS OUR LIVE BUILDING CALIFORNIA'S FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE ALL FELL ON THAT HEALTH LYING. UNDER THE MODEL CHANGES THEY WOULD MAKE FUTURE LONG TERM. CARE -- ASSESSMENT LIABILITY 50% WOULD BE ON HEALTH MEMBER INSURERS AND 50% -- LIABILITY WOULD BE ON LIFE AND ANNUITY MEMBER INSURERS. SO THAT WOULD BROADEN THE BASE OUR ASSESSMENT BASE AND THAT WOULD I THINK A DRAFT. CONCERNED THAT WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY -- I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO OTHER MEMBERS IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. AND JUST A SIDE NOTE UP SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ARE RUNNING IN AND OUT DUE TO OTHER COMMITTEE SO IF THEY'VE ASKED TO BE EXCUSED SO -- SO WELCOME MISTER MORE LIKE. GOOD MORNING.

FIRST WE HAVE -- GLENN POMEROY THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY OFFERS RESIDENTIAL EARTHQUAKE COVERAGE. ONLY A FEW PRIVATE INSURERS OFFER EARTHQUAKE COVERAGE TODAY AND THE CA MAKES SURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER HAS THE CHOICE. WE ALSO HAVE WITH US AND THE LEAST. GIOVANE HOPEFULLY SAID THAT CORRECTLY AND A PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN ASSOCIATION -- AS WE HEARD BEFORE THE FAIR PLAN PROVIDES BASIC HOMEOWNER INSURANCE AND ALSO SOME COMMERCIAL PROPERTY COVERAGE WITH OTHER. OTHER INSURERS DON'T THIS OPTION IS PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE AND HI FI RISK AREAS.

ASSIST THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE MONITORING. TRANSACTIONS WITH THE I. INSURERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE STATE THESE INSURERS OFFER HOMEOWNERS AND COMMERCIAL. INSURANCE THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND TAKING THE TIME SO WE'LL START WITH YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- PLEASURE TO BE HERE. IN A PREVIOUS LIFE A VERY LONG TIME AGO I WAS ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN MY HOME STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA. LAND OF NORTH WICKS WHATSOEVER. SELECT THE WHEN I WAS TWENTY TWO AND SERVE SIX YEARS. AND LATER SERVICE SERVED EIGHT YEARS AS A STATE ELECTORAL COMMISSIONER. WILL BE IN FOR A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE DEALING WITH INSURANCE I FEEL RIGHT AT HOME IN A FUTURE INTEREST IN ALL OF THESE MATTERS. I WILL GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY WE DESIGNED A LITTLE PACKET REALLY DESIGNED TO BE A LEAVE BEHIND SO JUST BLAST THROUGH QUICKLY SO YOU SEE WHAT'S HERE. BUT IT'S ALSO MEANT TO REALLY BE AN INVITATION WE'RE JUST A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY. AND IF YOU WERE ANY MEMBERS HERE COMMITTEE YOUR STAFF HAVE ANY QUESTIONS EVER BY THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. THIS GIVES A BUZZ AND WE'LL BE RIGHT HERE THANK YOU FOR THAT. THE SEEDS OF THE M. I'M PAUL BEGIN ON SLIDE TO THE OF THE OF THIS PACK. THE SEEDS OF THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY WERE PLANTED TEN YEARS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY FORMED. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THERE WAS SOME REFERENCE TO IT EARLIER. AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED WHAT'S CALLED THE MANDATORY OFFER LAW. IN CALIFORNIA FOR EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE. EARTHQUAKE IN A COVERAGE WAS SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE HOMEOWNER'S POLICY AT THAT TIME. BUT LIKE INTEREST COMPANIES PICKED UP THE MANDATORY OBLIGATION TO OFFER A SEPARATE EARTHQUAKE INTEREST POLICY WHEN THEY SOLD THE UNDERLYING HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. MANDATORY OFFER. NO NEED TO BUY IT NUMBER EVERYBODY NEEDS. TO RECEIVE THE OFFER. TEACHERS COMPANIES WERE FINE WITH THAT MANDATE FOR THE FIRST TEN YEARS UNTIL ON SLIDE C. N. SIDE THREE WE START TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY SEVENTEENTH. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE POWERFUL SIX POINT SEVEN THAT STRUCK. IN THE IN THE COMMUNITY OF NORTHRIDGE DOESN'T THE LOSS OF LIFE AND AND AND TREMENDOUS PROPERTY DAMAGE AS WELL. SLIDE. FOUR ILLUSTRATES THAT DAMAGE FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY DAMAGE IN TOTAL. HALF OF THAT WAS RESIDENTIAL HAVE ALL THE DAMAGE IN NORTHRIDGE -- PROPERTY DAMAGE IS RESIDENTIAL AND HALF OF THAT WAS INSURED BECAUSE IT INSURANCE WITH IT -- CREATURES WAS SO CHEAP BACK AT THE NORTHRIDGE STRUCK BECAUSE NO ONE UNDERSTOOD THE RISK. COMPUTED BEEN OFFERING IT NOT CHARGING MUCH FOR IT. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE INSURED AND AND AND THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TOOK A HEAVY HIT THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. BUT THAT WAS THE MOMENT IN TIME IS THE COMMISSION MENTIONED WHEN MOST OF THE INDUSTRY SAID WE CAN'T DO IT AGAIN. AND SO THEY DON'T THE INDUSTRY APPROACH THE LEGISLATUR AND ATTEMPTED TO GET THE MANDATE THAT THEY OFFER. ELIMINATED BUT THE LEGISLATURE REFUSED AND SAID YOU'RE THE HOMEOWNERS MARKET YOU'RE GOING TO OFFER EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE -- COMPANIES THEN. REFUSING READING TO HOMEOWNERS POLICIES. ACROSS THE BOARD BASICALLY AND PEOPLE COULDN'T BUY A HOME BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET LED UP TO HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. THAT WAS THE CRISIS THAT LED TO THE CREATION OF THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY IN THE MID NINETIES. IN THE END THE WAY WE WERE ESTABLISHED. IF YOU LOOK AT SLIDE. FIVE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAWS C. WAS FORMED A PUBLIC INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE STATE NOT A STATE AGENCY BUT THIS SORT OF UNIQUE HYBRID. CREATURE WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN INSURANCE COMPANIES. BY LAW WERE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN. AND THESE COMPANIES DID JOIN THE CA. RECALL MORE PARTICIPATING INSURERS. YEAH THE PAY TO JOIN THE APPEAL OUGHT TO JOIN AND THAT'S HOW THE CA RECEIVE HIS INITIAL CAPITALIZATION. THE LAW PLACED A BILLION DOLLARS IN STATUTE AND BASICALLY SAID ANY COMPANY THAT SEEKS TO JOIN. MUST PAY A PERCENTAGE OF A BILLION THIS DETERMINED BY ITS HOMEOWNERS MARKET SHARE. SO JUST USING ONE EXAMPLE STATE FARM. WHICH HAD ABOUT 30% OF THE HOMEOWNERS MARKET. THEIR PRICE TO NTER WAS WAS 30% OF A BILLION OR THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. WHICH SEATED INTO THE COMPANY BECAME THE C. CAPITAL FOR THE ORGANIZATION. SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION WAS. THAT TIME IN THE ORGANIZATION WAS UP AND RUNNING THAT'S THE GENESIS OF THE CALIFORNIA THREE THIRTY AND THEN. EVER SINCE IT IS. AGENTS OF THESE COMPANIES THAT SELL OUR POLICY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY INSURANCE AGENTS. AGES OF THESE COMPANIES THAT SELL OUR POLICY. BUT THEY SELL IT AT THE RATES WE DETERMINE WHICH ARE NOT FOR PROFIT ACTUALLY STONE. APPROVED BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. IDENTICAL REGARDLESS OF WHICH COMPANY IS CELLS ARE POLICY. AND IT'LL BE THE ADJUSTERS OF THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE JUST LOSSES FOR US. AFTER AN EVENT -- PURSUIT OUR GUIDELINES. THE ATTEMPT HERE WAS TO KEEP US LEAN AND MEAN AND AND AND THEREFORE FOCUS ON MAKING EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE MORE AFFORDABLE AND WE MADE SOME PROGRESS. OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES. SLIDE SIX JUST A QUICK VIEW OF HOW WE'RE GOVERNED. WE'RE PUBLICLY MANAGED AT BECAUSE WE'RE PUBLIC INSTRUMENTALITY THE GOVERNOR THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE STATE TREASURER OUR BOARD MEMBERS WITH THE TWO LEADERS OF THE LEGISLATURE SERVING AS NON VOTING MEMBERS. WE NOW HAVE OVER MILLION POLICY POLICY HOLDERS WITH A PUBLIC MISSION. UP AROUND MAKING EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE MORE ATTRACTIVE AND INVALUABLE AND MORE AFFORDABLE AS WELL. FIRST OF ALL WITH RESPECT TO AFFORDABILITY ON SLIDE. SEVEN SINCE WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS THE COST TO REBUILD HOMES OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS HAS GONE UP OVER A 170%. SO IF WE WERE JUST SITTING IN OUR DESK COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY REASON RATES WHATEVER RECONSTRUCTION COSTS WENT UP. NO ONE WOULD AFFORD A BE ABLE TO FOR A QUICK INSURANCE ANYMORE. YEAH WE HAVE FOUND WAYS TO LOWER RATES BY OVER 50% THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FACTORS. RESULTING IN. AN INSURANCE POLICY TODAY. WOULD COST TWICE AND WHAT IT DOES HAD WE NOT HAD THIS PUBLIC ENTERPRISE A WORKING TO MAKE COST MORE AFFORDABLE SO. WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN IN THE AFFORDABILITY SIDE. A SLIGHT EIGHT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE OFFER. THE THE MIDDLE COLUMN AND I WILL GO INTO DETAIL BUT THE MIDDLE COLUMN REPRESENTS THE BARE BONES MINIATURE. CALL MANY POLICY THE BARE BONES SET OF BENEFITS THAT A COMPANY HAS TO OFFER IN ORDER TO CHECK THE BOX THAT THE SATISFIED THE MANDATORY OFFER LAW. BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS PUBLIC MISSION. WHERE WE WORK TO MAKE OUR COVERAGE MUCH MORE OF? A VALUABLE TO OUR I'M ON THE RIGHT A WIDE RANGE OF OPTIONS NOW WIDE RANGE OF DEDUCTIBLES AND AT OUR PEOPLE TO CHOOSE FROM A BAND. AID A DISCOUNT THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO TAKE PROPER STEPS DIRECTOR FOR THE ROLLER HOME WE WANT HOMES INSURED WITH A POLICY THEY CAN AFFORD. THEY'LL BE BACK BY IT A PUBLIC ENTERPRISE WILL BE HERE TO PAY THEIR CLAIMS. ON SLIDE. NINE AND ELEVEN ACTUALLY IT'S INTERESTING INVITE YOU ALL TO GO TO OUR WEBSITE. EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY DOT COM AND JUST PLAY AROUND WITH IT WERE A PREMIUM CALCULATOR THAT WE HAVE THERE TOO SO YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH IT. POLICY COST. IN YOUR DISTRICT. WHERE THE HOME IS LOCATED? IN GOING THE CALCULATORS SET THE THE OPTIONS THAT YOU WANT AND SEE IMMEDIATELY WHAT THAT POLICY WILL COST YOU. AND MOST PEOPLE WHO DO THIS FIND IT COSTS MUCH LESS THAN THEY THOUGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T CHECKED INTO IT FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS. AND CALIFORNIA'S ARE RESPONDING SLIDE. TEN MORE ARE GETTING INSURED. WITH THIS WHOLE WHEN WE'RE NOT BREAKING ARMS BETTER CELLS ON THE BACK BECAUSE ONLY 13% OF ALL HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY OF ALSO PURCHASED EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE GROWTH OF OUR POLICIES. ON SLIDE. TEN WE'RE FINANCIALLY STRONG. A SLIGHT ELEVEN IS A DEMONSTRATION OF OUR BUT I CLAIMS BEING CAPABILITY. WE'RE GOOD FOR ONE OF FOUR HUNDRED YEAR EARTHQUAKE. BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT REALLY MEANS THERE'S ONLY A ONE IN FOUR HUNDRED CHANCE THAT WE DON'T HAVE 1100% ENOUGH. TO BE ONE OF THE PERCENT OF OUR CLAIMS THAT THIS IS VERY STRONG AS A VERY CONSERVATIVE BENCHMARK SET FOR US BY THE RATING AGENCIES. AND IN THE INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT OF THAT TOWER. IF YOU SEE M.. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR NORTHRIDGE EVENT IF AT NORTHRIDGE WILL REOCCUR TODAY WE ESTIMATE OUR LOSSES WOULD BE SEVEN HALF BILLION. AND YET WE HAVE SEVENTEEN BILLION IN CLAIMS BEING CAPABILITY SO THAT WE HAVE FINANCIAL STRENGTH. WE PAY DEARLY FOR IT. BYE BYE BYE BASICALLY ACQUIRING A TON OF REINSURANCE. WHICH WE PAY FOR INSURANCE FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES WE HAVE SPENT ABOUT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ON REINSURANCE SINCE WE'VE BEEN AROUND OVER THE PAST TWENTY TWO YEARS WE SPENT OVER THREE AND A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A REINSURANCE LAST YEAR. AND AND AND THROUGHOUT THE TIME TO RECEIVE -- REINSURANCE RECOVERIES OVER BASICALLY BUYING PROTECTION FOR A VERY LARGE AND FREQUENT EVENT BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH IN CASE THAT HAPPENS. WE SEE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THERE IT WILL BE TALKING MORE TO YOUR COMMITTEE ABOUT THAT AS WE GO FORWARD. THE BILL OF GLOSS OVER THE HISTORY ON SLIDE THIRTEEN TO LEAVE THAT FOR YOUR ATTENTION JUST SURE HOW THE CAPACITY HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. I DON'T WANT TO END BY TALKING ABOUT. ONE PROGRAM THAT WE DO OFFER THAT I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT IN IN IN. IN THIS PROGRAM IS RELEVANT IN MOST OF YOUR DISTRICT. ALL THEIR QUICK BASEBALL PROGRAM. WE HAVE SOME FUNDING LIMITED FUNDING AVAILABLE TO MAKE GRANTS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO RETROFIT THEIR OLDER HOME. BY GOING INTO THE CRAWL SPACE PUTTING SOME BRACES BOLTS. THE THE THE THE TWO HOMES YOU SEE INSIDE FOURTEEN HOMES TO HOMES IN NAPA. BUILT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. THE BLUE HOME IT BEEN RETROFITTED YEARS AGO THE YELLOW HOME HAD NOT BEEN. THE NAPA EARTHQUAKE RENDER THAT YELLOW HOME UNLIVABLE FOR SEVERAL YEARS ACOSTA REPAIR SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND A FEW THOUSAND BUCKS RICHER FOR THAT BLUE HOME AND IN A LOT OF STATE A STANDING DURING THE EARTHQUAKE WE NEED THE RHETORIC MORE HOMES. WE HAVE THIS BREATHABLE PROGRAM WHICH IS GREAT. FIVE FIFTEEN M. L. GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL ON THAT. WE CAN DO ABOUT TWO THOUSAND HOMES A YEAR RIGHT NOW. WITH THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. LATER THIS MONTH WILL BE BEFORE YOU WITH A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THAT AMOUNT OF FUNDING. IN A A SAY THAT DETAIL FOR FOR THAT HEARING BUT WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING THERE COMMITTEE ON THAT MEASURE. ONE PIECE OF NEWS I WANT TO GIVE YOU DON'T. THE GRANTS THAT WE MAKE AVAILABLE. THE THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO TWO THOUSAND LUCKY CALIFORNIANS. WELL. THE LEGISLATURE ME THOSE NON TAXABLE AT THE STATE LEVEL -- WHEN WE ROLLED OUT THIS PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD? THE DEMOCRATS ARE TAXABLE FEDERALLY. THEY SHOULDN'T BE IF OUR GRANTS WERE FUNDED BY. FOR A FEMALE GRANT WHICH SOMETIMES THEY ARE THEY'RE NOT TAXABLE BUT FOR CHRIS ARE FUNDED BY THE A MONEY. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES TO SHARE THEIR TAXABLE FEDERALLY. CONGRESSMAN MIKE THOMPSON ANSWER COME A HARRIS ARE ENDING IT -- JOINTLY ISSUING A RELEASE ANNOUNCING LEGISLATION IN CONGRESS BIPARTISAN IN NATURE TO ELIMINATE THE TAX FEATURE. OF OF THESE GRANTS ASSUMES A RELEASE COMES OUT I'LL GET IT TO COMMITTEE STAFF I WAS HOPING WOULD HAVE IT BY NOW BUT I THINK WE'RE JUST ABOUT AN HOUR TO BE. TOO EARLY. SO I'M SURE. WE'RE WORKING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. TO IMPROVE OUR PROGRAMSWERE WORKING HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL THERE'S A COUPLE BILLS. IN THIS LEGISLATION IN THIS SESSION THAT PERTAIN TO THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH A IT WITH YOUR COMMITTEE AND THE AND THE LEGISLATURE. AS WE GO FORWARD TO MAKE CONTINUE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE THIS QUICK INSURANCE. MORE AFFORDABLE AND MORE AVAILABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU I SEE SENATOR DOT HAS A QUESTION MR DOT. THANK YOU OFFER VERY INFORMATIVE -- PRESENTATION. I'M I'M LOOKING AT THE TOWER RIGHT NOW AND THINK OF THE TOPIC I A L. I. YES. WHAT'S I APOLOGIZE AND THAT'S FOR INDUSTRY ASSESSMENT LAYER. IN THE END INDUSTRY MEANING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS BEING ASSESSED FOR THAT AMOUNT THE COMPANIES THAT PARTICIPATE WITH US YES IF THERE'S AN EVENT AND WE PAY FOR THE BOTTOM UP. HE A INTEREST SURCHARGE IS A IS A IS A BILLION DOLLARS I ASSUME THIS IS SURCHARGE POLICY HOLDER THAT'S GREAT. IN BOND PROCEEDS WE'VE ISSUE SOME DEBT PREVIOUSLY AND HAVE THOSE PROCEEDS AVAILABLE TO US REPAYING THAT DEBT TO OUR PREMIUM GOING FORWARD -- SAYS REVENUE BONDS THAT WE'VE COLLECTED AND TUCKED AWAY AND MADE PART OF OUR CLAIMS BEING CAPABILITY I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL THE PROGRAM I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. YEAH WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING THANK YOU BASICALLY YOU GOT THIS -- THIS STACK HERE WHICH SO YOU GOT CAPITA GET THE REINSURANCE. BUT IF YOU COMPARED THE WORST POSSIBLE CATASTROPHE THAT WE HAD SINCE THE NINETEEN OH SIX EARTHQUAKE. YOU'RE ONLY ABOUT HALF BROUGH THAT REINSURANCE. MY QUESTION IS IS WHY WOULD WE PAY. FOR THAT MUCH REINSURANCE. KNOWING THAT WE HAVE BOND PROCEEDS ALREADY. AND WE HAVE THIS INDUSTRY AND ASSESSMENT IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THE THE MARKER THAT WE SEE THAT WE NEED TO CLIMB UP TO IS A ONE IN FOUR HUNDRED YOUR LEVEL OF PREPARATION. THAT'S NOT SPELLED OUT A STATE LAW BUT THAT'S A BASICALLY MANDATE IMPOSED ON US BY THE RATING AGENCIES AND BEST MOODY'S AND FITCH. WHO WANT TO SEE THAT WE HAVE A ONE IN FOUR HUNDRED YOUR CLAIMS THINK CAPABILITY IN ORDER TO GIVE US THE FAVORABLE CREDIT RATING AT THAT THAT WE NEED? IN ORDER TO ACCESS DEBT MARKETS IF WE EVER NEED. TO SORT OF HAND CUFF TO THE TOTAL STACK EYES I CALLED -- TOWERS YOU CALLED IT. IS A ONE IN FOUR HUNDRED IT'S GOT. THE NINETEEN OH SIX EARTHQUAKE HIM WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT BE LIKE A ONE IN TWO HUNDRED STANDARD THEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH -- YEAH OKAY THANK YOU. IT. I HAVE ONE QUESTION IF I MAY SORRY [inaudible] THIS MORNING. I'M SORRY I MISSED YOU. THERE WAS NORTH BREAK INSURANCE BACK IN BUT THERE WAS FIRE INSURANCE. AND MOST THE DAMAGES CAUSED BY FIRE -- BUT IT IT REALLY WIPED OUT. FIREMAN'S FUND -- INSURANCE COMPANY AND AND ADDRESSES ALL WHITE IN THE IN THE WHOLE NARRATIVE SAID THAT. IN ORDER TO MEET CLAIMS THEY GAVE. THEY PAID HALF IN CASH AND HALF IN STOCK KEEP THE COMPANY GOING. BUT THAT THERE WAS AN INTERESTING LITTLE MISTER YEAH. THANK YOU I'M. NORTHRIDGE I DON'T BELIEVE HAVE FIRES. SO MUCH DOES THE SHAPE WHAT HAPPENS IF. AN EARTHQUAKE CREATES. FIRE THAN WHEN YOU'RE HOMEOWNERS AND KICK IN YES I WOULD. TO THE HOMEOWNERS IS SPECIFIC WOULD SHAKE DAMAGE. CONTINUES TO COVER FIRE. REGARDLESS OF THE PUTTING EARTHQUAKE TO THE HOMEOWNERS COVERS FIRE. AND WE COVER SHAKE. WE'RE CHATTING BEFOREHAND THERE MAY COME A DAY WHEN WE WILL GAS AND FIGURE OUT TO DO AFTER A BIG EARTHQUAKE WHAT CAUSED THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HOME WAS OF THE EARTHQUAKE THAT CAME FIRST OF THE FIRE THAT CAME LATER. BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS PUBLIC INSTRUMENTALITY THE STATE. THERE WILL BE AN EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PEOPLE GET PAID. THE BIGGEST. THING WE'RE FINDING IN OUR HEARINGS. WITH THE WILD FIRES AND NAPA SONOMA. IS THAT TO HAVE. YOU CAN BUY CHEAP HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AND THEN WHEN FIRE COMES YOU REALIZE YOU JUST BOUGHT SHE FIRE INSURANCE AND I'LL BE SEEING. OUR AYE BYE BYE QUICK INSURANCE PRIVACY. I'M ONE OF THE FEW IN THE STATE. AND I JUST WONDER HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE MASSIVE REACTION OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO SAY WELL I DIDN'T KNOW THAT MY HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE DIDN'T COVER. EARTHQUAKES IN ECM OFFLINE AND OUR HALL SAYING HELP MAKE US WHOLE WHICH IS TRYING TO DO. WITH ALL THE WILD FIRES ARE WHAT KIND OF MARKETING ARE YOU. WELL THAT THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS. AND IF THE BIG ONE HITS AND YOU ARE. NAKED AND DON'T HAVE INSURANCE. YOU KNOW YOU YET THAT'S EXPOSURE YOU HAVE A YES MA'AM GERMS AND MORE LIKE WHAT. WE WOULD DO WE CAN WITH THE DOLLARS WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO WE WE HAVE A FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLAR. MARKETING BUDGET. WE'RE OUT THERE IN RADIO AND TV AND SOCIAL MEDIA. WOULD BE TRAVEL AROUND AND AND AND SB TO ROTARY CLUBS AND AND WE DO WE CAN DIVERT TO REACH OUT TO GET THE WORD OUT. IT IS DISCLOSED AND POLICIES COURSE. NUMBERS READ OUR POLICIES IT'S ALWAYS INCOME UPON US TO GET THE WORD OUT NOT ONLY THAT IS NOT COVERED HOMEOWNERS POLICY. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO REALIZE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SECOND COMMENDED BILL EVERYBODY OUT WE DID WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA COME AND REBUILD EVERYBODY'S HOMES THERE'S DISASTER ASSISTANCE. THANK GOD BUT IT DOESN'T REBUILD HOMES. SO THERE ARE THERE ARE MISS THAT WE COSTLY TRY TO OVERCOME. AND THEN WE GET WE HAVE TO KEEP AT IT THE FACT MATTER IS. EARTHQUAKES A TOUGH SELL BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN AND SO PEOPLE JUST PUT OUT A PUT. OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND THE LAST REALLY BIG DAMAGING EARTHQUAKE WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. HELLO PEOPLE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE ONE AND THINK WELL THIS EARTHQUAKE SOME MOVED ON BUT THEY HAVEN'T SENT TO SAY. 99% PROBABILITY OF IN NORTHRIDGE SIZED EARTHQUAKE HAPPENING AGAIN IN THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS SOMETIME TOMORROW WE'RE SEVERAL YEARS FROM NOW. WHAT I FIND EVEN MORE TROUBLING IS THE SAME SIDE TO SAY? THERE'S A FIFTY FIFTY CHANCE. TOSS A COIN FIFTY FIFTY SHOT OF A SEVEN POINT FIVE EARTHQUAKE HAPPEN CALIFORNIA SEEM PRETTY TIME. THAT'S AN EARTHQUAKE SIXTEEN TIMES STRONGER THE NORTHRIDGE. WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE YOU READY IN ALL SORTS OF FACETS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU FOR THAT I SIMILAR TO HIS QUESTION I AM A LITTLE CURIOUS I GET WE HEARD -- RESTAURANT LOTTA STATE EARLIER TODAY THERE'S ONLY 11% TAKE UP RATE AND AND TIME CURIOUS ABOUT HOW LONG. HAS IT TAKEN US TO GET TO LIVE A PERCENT AND I KNOW YOU'VE EXPRESSED SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE GET PEOPLE INVOLVED IN KNOWING THAT THERE IS OUT THAT INSURANCE. WHAT OTHER PLANS ARE STEPS ARE YOU GONNA TAKE IN TERMS OF -- MAKING PEOPLE AWARE THAT THERE IS THAT INSURANCE. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I MAKE A SLIGHT CORRECTION -- TO THE COMMISSIONER THE TAKE A RATE IS NOW WHOPPING THIRTEEN POINT 2% SO WE'RE UP FROM. ELEVEN ENTER FOR CATION -- WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY SMALL NUMBER BUT WE'VE WORKED REALLY HARD TO GET IT THERE I WILL SEE THAT IN THE IN THE TEN YEARS LEADING UP. TO TWENTY SIXTEEN OVER TEN YOU'RE PRETTY TIME. DESPITE ALL OF OUR EFFORTS COURSE IT WAS A RECESSION AND EVERYTHING ELSE DESPITE ALL THE PROMOTION THINGS THAT WE WERE DOING. WE GREW ON AVERAGE ONLY SIX THOUSAND POLICIES A YEAR. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE IMPROVES OF THE LANGUAGE THAT THAT GOES OUT IN THE OFFER WE IMPROVED OUR COVERAGE OPTIONS WE LOWER RATES AGAIN. IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN I WOULDN'T GO BY SIX THOUSAND WE GREW BY. NINETY THOUSAND A BIG JUMP THAT IT WAS A TRIBUTE TAUGHT BOTH THE IMPROVEMENTS IN IN THE IN THE POLICY BUT ALSO. WORKING HARVEY AND IRMA AND A BIG MEXICO A BIGGER EARTHQUAKE IN MEXICO BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE. TO BE AWARE OF THE FACT THEY NEED TO BE INSURED. SO SOME OF THIS IS WITHIN OUR CONTROL WE DO WE CAN TO MAKE THE PRODUCT BETTER AND GET THE WORD OUT. SOME OF IT IT JUST COME FROM AWARENESS WHEN BAD EVENTS HAPPEN ELSEWHERE AND PEOPLE ARE SUDDENLY MOTIVATED. BUT BUT WE WE WE WE ARE COMMITTED MADAM CHAIR DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. THIS PUBLIC INSTRUMENTALITY. TO ENSURE AS MANY HOMES AS POSSIBLE. RETROFIT ISN'T AS MANY OLDER HOMES AS POSSIBLE EXCITED TO BE BACK IN FRONT OF YOU IN A COUPLE WEEKS WITH A BILL THAT WE THINK WILL A LOT HELP US TO DO BOTH. WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU SIR SO MISTER BOND. HAVE A FOURTH THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. NEAR ME. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN I'M I AM UNLESS YOU'VE ON I'VE BEEN RUNNING THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND NINE SO TEN YEARS I WANTED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE FAIR PLAN AND POSSIBLY EVEN DISPEL SOME MYTHS ABOUT THE FAIR PLAN -- THERE. MANY INACCURACIES THAT PEOPLE TEND TO THINK ABOUT WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT. THEM. YOUR PLAN WAS CREATED BY STATUTE IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THAT WAS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE LA RIOTS. AND THE BELLER FIGHTERS ONE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE LEGISLATURE -- EFFECTIVELY ASKS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO CREATE THE FAIR PLAN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. WITH FOUR WITH. FOUR PURPOSES THE FIRST IS TO ASSURE THE STABILITY OF THE PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET IN THE STATE. SURE THE AVAILABILITY OF BASIC PROPERTY INSURANCE IN THE STATE. TO ENCOURAGE THE MAXIMUM USE OF THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET OTHER WORDS DON'T COMPETE WITH THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. AND THEN -- FOR THE ADMITTED INSURERS TO ESTABLISH A FAIR PLAN SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR MANDATES IN THE IN THE CODE ITSELF. THE FAIR PLAN IS AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY WHO HAS. INSURABLE PROPERTY MEANS THAT MEANS THERE IS YOU KNOW THE ROOF NOT FALLING APART THERE'S NO ON REPAIR DAMAGE. THE FAIR PLAN WILL NOT TURN ANYBODY AWAY BASE SOMEWHERE THEIR PROPERTIES LOCATED HOW MANY TREES ARE ON THERE PRETTY -- WHAT THE PROTECTION CLASSES THOSE ARE ALL RISKS THAT? COME TO THE FAIR PLAN GET IT JUST NEEDS TO BE AN INSURABLE CONDITION THAT IS. PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY REASON WHY WE WOULDN'T WRITE A POLICY. YOUR PLANS A PRIVATE ASSOCIATION THERE'S NO PUBLIC FUNDING NO TAXPAYER MONEY IS INVOLVED THE FAIR PLAN IS ALSO NOT A STATE AGENCY. INSURERS ADMITTED TO ISSUE POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FAIR PLAN. AND IT'S FOR FOR THE MOST PART IT'S A MARKET SHARE. I'M PARTICIPATION THERE ARE SOME RIGHT OUT CREDITS AVAILABLE THOSE ARE PRETTY LIMITED SO IN A FACT WHATEVER YOUR MARKET SHARES IN THE STATE IN TWO YEARS AGO THAT IS YOUR THAT IS YOUR CHILD THE WELL -- WHEN NECESSARY THE FAIR PLAN CAN DO AN ASSESSMENT OF THE MEMBER COMPANIES? THOSE TO BE APPROVED ARE TO BE APPROVED BY THE INSURANCE. NO POLICY DISTRIBUTION THIS IS A THIS IS AN AREA THAT DOWN. PEOPLE USUALLY FIND VERY. SURPRISING AND HISTORICALLY THE FAIR PLAN RIGHT POLICIES IN VERY LIMITED AREA. EARLY URBAN AREAS AND VERY SPECIFIC FIRE PRONE AREAS. AND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT'S HOW THE FAIR PLAN STARTED. ALL OF THE AREAS WERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND ALMOST ALL THAT WAS IN LA COUNTY OUT OVER THE YEARS THAT'S EVOLVED WE NOW RIGHT IN THE ENTIRE STATE. HOWEVER PRIOR TO TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN I TOOK OVER THE FAIR PLAN. APPLICATIONS FOR POLICIES WRITTEN OUTSIDE OF A VERY NARROW AREA IN LA COUNTY REQUIRED -- THREE DECLINATIONS THAT WE WE REQUIRE THAT ON THE APPLICATION THE NAMES OF THREE COMPANIES THAT TURNED YOU DOWN FOR BUSINESS. I'M MORE INCLUDED ON THE APPLICATION. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AT AT MY REQUEST -- THAN INSURANCE COMMISSIONER JONES REMOVE THIS REQUIREMENT BECAUSE I BELIEVED AND I STILL BELIEVE IT. MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO COME TO THE FAIR PLAN -- MOST COMPANIES WERE WILLING. TO YOU KNOW THEY KNOW THAT AN AGENT WILL KNOW UP FRONT THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO WRITE THIS PIECE OF BUSINESS BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO GIVE THAT. POLICY OLDER PIECE OF PAPER SAYING WE WANT RIGHT YOU WE WERE MAKING IT HARD FOR PEOPLE TO COME TO THE FAIR PLAN. AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY WE WE REMOVE THAT REQUIREMENT IT'S MADE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO COME TO THE FAIR ON WHEN THEY NEED. TO TODAY YOUR PLAN RIGHT POLICIES IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA COUNTY. THE FIVE COUNTIES WITH THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF I'M POLICIES NOT SURPRISINGLY LOS ANGELES HAS 66%. OF ALL THE I'M POLICIES -- MY SAN BERNADINO WITH 10% SAN DIEGO WITH 4% RIVERSIDE WITH 3% IN ORANGE WITH 2%. NO NO THOSE ARE ALSO A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTY [inaudible] NOW COMBINED. THOSE FIVE COUNTIES ACCOUNT 485% OF I'M POLICY TODAY. NOW 72% OF POLICIES ARE URBAN -- THAT REMAINS ARE YOU KNOW THE BULK OF OUR BOOK OF BUSINESS HOWEVER THAT SHRINKING LAST YEAR IT WAS AT 75% OF OUR POLICIES. TO WE'RE LOSING URBAN CUSTOMERS. PRESUMABLY THEY'RE ABLE TO FIND BUSINESS ELSEWHERE AND WE ARE GAINING MORE CUSTOMERS THAT ARE IN THE AND THE WILL IN THE BRUSH WELFARE EXPOSED. THEIR PLAN RIGHTS POLICIES. UNDER ANOTHER METHOD BUT I WANTED TO SPELL WE WRITE POLICIES IN A CROSS SECTION OF SOCIO ECONOMIC AREAS. AND I INCLUDED SOME -- REFERENCES HERE FOR EXAMPLE. ALMOST PERCENT OF OUR POLICIES ARE WRITTEN IN BEVERLY HILLS. EQUALLY IN MALIBU. CALABASAS WE HAVE HALF A PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL POLICY COUNTY AND SANTA BARBARA HAS POINT 3% OF OUR TOTAL POLICY. IN SAN BERNADINO COUNTY WHICH IS THE SECOND LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF POLICIES OF THE FAIR PLAN. A FULL QUARTER OF THE POLICIES IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY ARE IN THREE CITY. LAKE ARROWHEAD. BIG BEAR CITY BIG BEAR LAKE NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT'S ALL IN THE SAN FERNANDO MOUNTAIN RANGE OF EVER BEEN THERE IT'S JUST IT'S A BEAUTIFUL AREA BUT IT'S A VERY VERY WOODED AREA. BURNED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IT'S A VERY HIGH RISK AREA IT'S NOT A SURPRISE THAT WE WRITE BUSINESS THERE. AGAIN ANOTHER METHOD I WANT TO DISPEL HALF OF THE POLICIES WE RIGHT THERE BY THE WAY THAT DRIVES UP ART LOSS EXPOSURE SIGNIFICANTLY BY HAVING THOSE KINDS OF CONCENTRATIONS. 51% FOR THE POLICIES WE WRITE IN THOSE THREE CITIES OUR VACATION HOME. AGAIN ANOTHER METHOD TO SPELL WE WRITE A LOT OF EDUCATIONAL. NOW THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AND I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON THAT REAL QUICK -- OUR RATES [inaudible] OUR PER THE INSURANCE CODE. RATES FOR THE FAIR PLAN SHALL NOT BE EXCESSIVE IN ADEQUATE OR UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY. AND SHALL BE ACTUAR EARLY SOUND THE PREMIUMS ARE ADEQUATE TO COVER EXPECTED LOSSES. WHAT THAT MEANS IS FAIR PLAN RATES ARE ESTABLISHED USING FAIR PLAN PREMIUM LOS EXPERIENCE? AND DOES IMPORTANT NO FAIR PLAN IS ALSO NOT SUBJECT ONE OF THREE I KNOW THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO HEAR BUT EFFECTIVE APRIL FIRST THIS PAST MONDAY OUR THEIR PLAN WELLING RATES. INCREASED AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY POINT 3% [inaudible] AND I NEED TO POINT OUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT WE FILE THOSE RATES LAST YEAR. LONG BEFORE THE CAMP AND WALLS IF I GIVEN OUR EXPERIENCE IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE ARE WORKING ON ANOTHER RATE FILING AND WE EXPECT ANOTHER RATE INCREASE BE EFFECTIVE IN. TWENTY ONE AGAIN WE ARE REQUIRED BY THE INSURANCE CODE HAVE ACTUALLY SOUND RIGHT. SO WE HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF IT. HOWEVER I AM VERY PLEASED TO SAY THE LAST THREE RATE CHANGES FAIR PLANTED WE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED RATES IN THE URBAN AREAS BECAUSE OUR LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE URBAN AREAS. HAS BEEN DESERVING ARRAY TO CREATE SOME VERY HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT. SPEAKING OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU'RE ALL AWARE THERE WAS A CAR FIRE. ALL BY. ON THE SAME DAY THE CAMP ON THE WALLS THE FIRE. WILL THE FIRE WAS THE SINGLE LARGEST EVENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN AS EVER EXPERIENCED. OTHER WILL THE FIRE ALONE. AS OF TWO DAYS AGO. OUR LOS X.. ARE LOS EXPECTATION FOR A FINAL LOSSES AROUND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. THE THREE THOSE THREE EVENTS COMBINED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN LOSSES. AND THOSE THAT NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR EVERYDAY LOSSES THAT WE GET ON A REGULAR BASIS WE WE GET NON CONTESTED LOSSES AS WELL. BY COMPARISON THE TOTAL PREMIUM WE COLLECTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS SEVENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE JUST FOR THOSE THREE EVENTS COMPARED TO SEVENTY SIX MILLION. SO IT WAS A IT WAS A BIG FINANCIAL HIT FOR THE FAIR PLAN AND OUR EXPOSURE CONTINUES TO GROW IN THESE AREAS SO OUR RATES HAVE TO REMAIN. WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY CONTINUE PAYING THESE LOSSES? NOW WHERE WE GROWING -- WE DO WITH WE'RE CURRENTLY WRITING THE TEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN RUNNING THE FAIR PLAN THE LAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTH PERIOD WE HAVE GROWN. SINCE I'VE BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE FAIR PLAN [inaudible] AND YOU KNOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR US REJECT HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO GROW WE ARE THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT WE JUST TAKE WHATEVER COMES OUR WAY WE DON'T DO MARKETING IN FACT. I OFTEN SAY THAT I WORK IN OPPOSITE WORLD WE TRY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO TO THE VOLUNTARY MARKET I SEE ONE OF MY MISSIONS IS -- TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE FAIR PLAN SHRINK ITS FOOTPRINT. THAT SAID I'M EXPECTING FUTURE GROWTH. I BELIEVE THAT THE FIRE THE PRIMARY REASON WE'RE GONNA BE GROWING IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW COMPANIES ARE. READJUSTING THEIR PORTFOLIOS AND WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING. WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS THEN RESPOND TO THE CUSTOMERS THAT DO COME OUR WAY. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THOUGH AS OF THE END OF FEBRUARY. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE GROWING AND IT'S AGAINST THE FIRST TIME WE'VE GROWN IN A SIX MONTH PERIOD -- IN THE TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN THERE WERE STILL WERE NOT EVEN AFTER TWENTY FOURTEEN POLICY POLICY COUNTS. SO AT THE MOMENT EVEN THOUGH. A WE ARE GROWING IT'S NOT TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S SIDE IT CONCERNS ME [inaudible] WE ARE. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF BRUSH WELFARE POLICIES WE'RE CURRENTLY WRITING WE'RE STILL AT RIGHT AROUND 2%? OF THE BRUSH WILDFIRE EXPOS POLICIES OF THE MEDIUM TO HIGH IN EXTREME RUSH WILDFIRE EXPOS POLICIES WHICH IS THE ONE THE ONES WE WOULD EXPECT TO GET. WITH ABOUT 2% OF THOSE IN OTHER WORDS THE VOLUNTARY MARKET IS STILL CURRENTLY WRITING 98%. OF THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HAVING HIGH OR EXTREMELY HIGH PRESSURE WELL PARKS BUT YOU'RE SO THAT'S THAT'S GOOD NEWS -- AGAIN WE'RE GROWING BUT WE'RE NOT GROWING MUCH. A I HAVE TO STEP OUT FOR A FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES MR DOT WILL BE TAKING OVER FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ACTUALLY THAT'S THE END OF MY ERA WE PRESENT. I KNOW IT'S NOT WE ALL WANTED TO HEAR BUT I I THOUGHT I'D RATHER JUST HAD IT HEAD ON AND SO THAT EVERYBODY'S FULLY INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THE FAIR PLAN IS AND HOW WE HAVE TO OFFER. GIVE ME THE QUESTION IS THIS NOW IF. THIS IS WHAT INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE OBVIOUSLY LOOKING AT IS THEY RICE OUT. OTHER. PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS THEIR PRICING OUT RISKY LOOKING AT THEIR REST -- A YES. THE INCREASE THE YOU HAVEN'T. ALREADY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR INCREASES FROM. FROM THAT POINT FORWARD. IS THAT ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU ACTUAR REALLY -- SOUND YEAH MOVING MOVING FORWARD WE ARE LOOKING AT OUR RATES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY IN THE MIDST OF DOING RATE ANALYSIS RIGHT NOW WHICH WILL BE SUBMITTING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. SOON -- LET'S HOPE SO THE THE PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T PREDICT WHEN THE NEXT CATASTROPHE GONNA HAPPEN. AND YOU KNOW JUST LIKE ON MY COLLEAGUE ON PALMER AT THE CA YOU KNOW WE WE EFFECTIVELY RUN CATASTROPHE BUSINESSES SO IT'S FEAST OR FAMINE EITHER I'M MAKING A LOT OF MONEY. AND I'M BANKING NOT. OR I'M PAYING OUT LIKE I DID IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN I IN WAYS THAT ARE JUST. MAKE YOUR MIND SPEND BUT WHAT YOU DO IS YOU LOOK AT THE RATES OVER THE LONG TERM. SO YOU CAN'T LOOK AT JUST LIKE US SHORT OF TIME AND SO. I'M AN ACTUARIAL STANDPOINT I BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO ACTUAL SOUNDNESS -- WITHOUT ANOTHER INCREASE OF THE MAGNITUDE WE HADN'T TWENTY EIGHTEEN I JUST WANNA BE REALLY CLEAR THAT THE ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING INTO EFFECT NOW I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA NEED ANOTHER RATE CHANGE. OF THAT MAGNITUDE AGAIN WE HAVE TO TAKE A VERY LONG TERM VIEW OF OUR RIGHT. YEAH THIS THAT'S QUESTION WILL PROBABLY -- JOE MY IGNORANCE TERMS OF HOW THE WHOLE THINGS ARE FUNDED BUT SO BE IT. DO YOU USE REINSURANCE AS PART OF THE PROTECTIONS AND EVERYTHING FOR THE AIRPLANE WE DO WE DO BY REINSURANCE I'M NOT ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT. WHAT MISTER PALMER I BUYS FOR THE CA BUT WE DO PURCHASE REINSURANCE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS? THAT COST ONE UP BY 67% THIS YEAR AND LET ME TELL YOU I'M A REALLY GOOD NEGOTIATOR REINSURANCE AND THAT'S THE BEST DEAL I CAN. SO CALLED THE REINSURANCE COSTS BUT THE INSURANCE FOR INSURANCE COMPANY COST. FOR THIS PERIL HAS GONE THROUGH THE ROOF. SO AM I AM I TEND TO BE ON THE LEADING EDGE IN TERMS OF INDICATORS ONLY BECAUSE WHEN MY READ ONE MY REINSURANCE -- TREATY RENEWS AND I'M EXPECTING THE REST OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE BECAUSE THERE THERE'S RENEW LATER IN THE YEAR. GENERALLY SPEAKING I'M EXPECTING THAT THE REST OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS GONNA BE FEELING THE PINCH AS WELL. FOR MORE ON OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. OKAY -- BENJAMIN MCKAY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CFO OF THE SURPLUS SURPLUS LINES ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA WELCOME. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD THANK YOU MANY MEMBERS. YES SURPLUS LINES ASSOCIATION WERE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT OF AN ASSOCIATION WE'RE NOT A RISK BEARING ORGANIZATION WERE A NOT FOR PROFIT ASSOCIATION FOUNDED IN. NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN BUT NOTABLY I BECAME THE ADVISORY ORGANIZATION FOR SURPLUS LINES WERE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND IN THAT ROLE WE DO WE CONDUCT SEVERAL MISSIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. OF MOST IMPORTANTLY ARE REVIEWING FOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY SPUR SOLVENCY TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN EITHER AND SECONDLY. PROCESSING EVERY SURPLUS LINES ALL SEE WORST MEANT [inaudible] FOR RENEWAL. AND LAST YEAR THAT WAS OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ITEMS THIS YEAR WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE. A NORTH OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ITEMS. WE CHECK EACH OF THOSE FOR LEGAL SUFFICIENCY AND WHERE THEY'RE LACKING. WE WE REACH OUT TO THE FILER OR CORRECTION AND WORK CORRECTIONS ARE NOT MADE WE THEN SUBMIT THOSE. POLICIES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THE PREMIUM ON THOSE POLICIES LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ARM SORRY SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN PREMIUM. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT MOST OF THE POLICIES THAT GO INTO THE SURPLUS LINES MARKETPLACE MARSHALL ALL. VERY FEW ARE OUR PERSONAL LINES INTO AND I MAKE THAT DISTINCTION. IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS. LARGELY PERSONAL. ONE AND SO I WOULD. A DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS DOCUMENT -- DOCUMENT THAT SAYS THE INSURANCE UNIVERSE. AND IF YOU GO THROUGH IT. THIS IS REALLY JUST WHEN I WORKED IN GOVERNMENT FIFTEEN YEARS THERE WAS AN OLD SAYING THAT SAID FOR EVERY. ACTION GOVERNMENT HAS AN EQUAL KNOCKS IT OVER REACTION. AND I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE WE FAILED TO HAVE A SENSE OF MAGNITUDE AT LEAST THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN MY FIFTEEN YEARS. SO I WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT SO IF WE HAVE THE INSURANCE UNIVERSE. YOU KNOW THERE'S REALLY THERE'S PROPERTY. THE LIFE AND WE'RE JUST TALKING HERE ABOUT PROPERTY. THAT'S ABOUT. FORTY EIGHT THEN IF YOU TAKE THAT 48% YES THEY HOW MUCH IS PERSONAL PERSON FIRST BILL. WILL 69% OF THAT IS PERSON. 69% OF FORTY EIGHT AND IF YOU TALK ABOUT HOMEOWNER TO DOWN 231% OF THAT BY. THEN IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHEN? MY PARK. FIND WERE TWO POINT 4% OF THE MARKET. LIVER AND SURPLUS LINES. ONE WORK NINETY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN POINT. SIX IT MADE A PART. THE DISTINCTION BEING THE ADMITTED MARKET ARE [inaudible] PERRANCE -- LICENSED BY THE STATE HELLO. SURPLUS LINES CARRIERS. ARE LICENSED BY SOMEBODY ELSE THE BATA. IT'S SOMEBODY WHO IN INSURANCE -- THAT'S NOT [inaudible] TERMINOLOGY [inaudible] MAKES. WARREN CARRIERS. THAT ARE IN OUR LICENSE. OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE UNITED STATES.

ENTERED GOES TO THEIR RETAIL. EIGHT THE MESSAGE IN THIRTEEN BE A COMMERCIAL AND OR BIRTH. THEY GO TO THEIR THEIR RETALIATION INTO IT THERE I NEED A POLICY ON MICHAEL.

WE'LL SEE YOU SOON THANK YOU. NEXT OUT WE WILL INVITE AT THE FOURTH PANEL WHICH IS A STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND. AND WE WILL HEAR FOR VERNE STEINER PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND WORKERS COMPENSATION IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT LINE OF INSURANCE AND THEY FUND HAS PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN MAKING SURE EMPLOYERS HAVE ACCESS TO COVERAGE ESPECIALLY. DURING DIFFICULT PERIOD SIDE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE YOU HAVE THE FRAZIER. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN RUBIO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- AS YOU JUST SAID MY NAME IS VERNE CENTER I'VE BEEN THE CEO AT STATE FUND. FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS I STARTED IN JUNE. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I'M HONORED AND REALLY HUMBLED TO SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT ROLE THAT STATE IN. PLACE IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM AND BECAUSE OF THE THOUSANDS OF HARD WORKING EMPLOYEES THAT I REPRESENT. I WAS GREETED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. AND IT PLAYS A UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT ROLE IN. THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. IT ET WE'RE UNIQUE IN THAT WE ARE A NOT FOR PROFIT PUBLIC ENTERPRISE. AB CHARGED WITH TWO ROLES TO BE AVAILABLE MARKET. YOU HEARD EARLIER -- BUT ALSO TO COMPETE FAIRLY IN THE INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. SO WE ARE NOT SOLELY A MARKET OF LAST RESORT FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE LIKE YOU HEARD WITH SOME OF THE OTHER. ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU LISTEN TO THAT. WE ARE A A AD I'M NOT FOR PROFIT AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISE -- BUT WE OPERATE SOLELY OFF OF THE THE PREMIUMS AND INVESTMENT. INCOME THAT WE GENERATE WE DON'T OPERATE OFF OF ANY TAX DOLLARS NO -- PUBLIC FUNDS GOING TO STATE. WE'RE GOVERNED BY AN INDEPENDENT BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH HAS BEEN GRANTED AUTHORITY OVER STATE FUNDS FINANCES AND OPERATIONS BY THE STATE CONSTITUTION AND INSURANCE CODE. IS STATUTES DICTATE THAT THE STATE FUND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OPERATE IS FULLY AND COMPLETELY AS THE GOVERNING BODY OF A PRIVATE INSURANCE. CALIFORNIA'S WORKER'S COMPENSATION MARKET AND THE EMPLOYERS AND INJURED WORKERS IT SIR IS RELY ON THE MODERATING AND STABILIZING INFLUENCE AND THE CRITICAL SAFETY NET THE STATE AND PROVIDES. IF THE PRIVATE MARKET WILL NOT -- INSURE A BUSINESS DAY FUND WILL. THE IMPORTANCE OF STATE FUNDS SAFETY NET ROLE IS PARTICULAR HIGHLIGHTED WHEN THE MARKET CONDITIONS WORSEN AND PRIVATE INSURANCE CARRIERS SCALE BACK THEIR OFF SAID I THINK WE HEARD EARLIER. FROM ABOUT THE TIME WHEN TWENTY SIX CARRIERS WHEN INSOLVENT. WELL THAT'S THAT WAS IMPORTANT -- TEST OF ONE OF STATE FUNDS MAIN FUNCTIONS BACK IT FROM. TWO THOUSAND ONE AND TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN THOSE CARRIERS WENT -- BECAME INSOLVENT. ABOUT 25% OF MARKET CAPACITY EVAPORATED. ALSO MANY NATIONAL CARRIERS RETREATED FROM CALIFORNIA AS IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT MARKET. THE FUND GREW INTO INCREDIBLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME LONG CREATED MY IN YOUR STATE FUN BUT IT GREW. IN A YEAR OR TWO FROM 1518% OF MARKET 53% OF THE MARKET. THAT'S IT HAD EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS A PREMIUM IT WAS THE LARGEST WORKERS COMPENSATION CARRIER IN THE COUNTRY BY PREMIUM BACK IN THAT. TIME. THEN THE LEGISLATURE STARTED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE INSTABILITY IN THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. AND BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THE REFORMS WERE INTRODUCED THERE WAS A PERIOD OF RELATIVE STABILITY. IN WORKERS COMPENSATION THAT IS MORE OR LESS CONTINUED SINCE THAT TIME. AND ACCELERATE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE WITH SB. EIGHT SIXTY THREE AND WE WENT FROM GROWING TREMENDOUSLY OVERNIGHT TO CONTRACT BEING EXTREMELY QUICKLY AS THE PRIVATE MARKET WANTED TO COME BACK INTO THE WORK COMPENSATION SYSTEM. SO HAVING EXPERIENCED S.. WE WILL LET ME SAY WITH IT. AB CURRENTLY D. V. WORKERS COMP IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IS ENJOYING ONE OF THE LONG GUESS I'M COMPETITIVE MARKET CYCLES CERTAINLY IN MY CAREER. HI AND THE BENEFITS OF SB SIXTY THREE WHICH REFORM THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE CONTINUE TO DRIVE RATE. DECREASES AND SO EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS ARE BENEFITING FROM THOSE RATE DECREASES EMPLOYERS HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE TODAY. SO HAVING EXPERIENCED THE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH FROM RAPID CONTRACTION THAT STATE FUND EPERIENCE FROM OF RELATIVE STABILITY TO BUILD OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE AND ENSURE WE CAN MEET OUR EXISTING LIABILITIES. AND A POTENTIAL DISASTERS AND ABSORB ADDITIONAL MARKET SHARE IF NEEDED IN THE FUTURE. TODAY WE SURE ENSURE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND WE WROTE ONE POINT THREE BILLION IN PREMIUM IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MAKING US ONE OF THE LARGEST WORKERS COMPENSATION JURORS IN THE NATION. WE'VE OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND APPROXIMATELY FORTY THREE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES FOCUSED ON HELPING BUSINESSES AND INJURED WORKERS I PREMIUM WE INSURE APPROXIMATELY 11% OF THE CALIFORNIA MARKET. IN ORDER TO REST EFFECTIVELY SERVE AS BOTH A MARKET OF CHOICE AND AS A SAFETY NET FOR EMPLOYERS IF NOT FIND INSURANCE. IN THE PRIVATE MARKET. WEHAVE TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY MIX OF BUSINESS. THIS SOMETIMES IN THE PAST A STATE PLAN IS BEEN REFERRED TO LIKE YOUR PLAN AS A MARKET OF LAST RESORT. IF WE ARE MARKET OF LAST RESORT AND ONLY HAVE THE BUSINESS THAT -- CAN'T FIND A HOME ANYWHERE ELSE WE WON'T BE IN A POSITION TO FLEX WHEN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET NEEDS US. SO TO ENSURE STATE FIVE TO ENSURE THE STATE FINE CAN COME EFFECTIVELY IN A QUICKLY INVOLVING INSURANCE MARKET WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A LARGE SCALE. TRANSFORMATION EFFORT THAT HAS IMPROVED THE ORGANIZATION'S CULTURE FINANCIAL STRENGTH CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND QUALITY. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MORE WORK AHEAD OF US OUR EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS AND PROVIDE IMPORTANT BENEFITS CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES INJURED WORKERS. WE MEETING SIGNIFICAN STRIDES IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF A CLAIM OPERATIONS. TO ACHIEVE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR EMPLOYERS AND INJURED WORKERS. WE'VE BEEN OVERHAULING OUR TECHNOLOGY BY REPLACING LEGACY PLATFORMS WITH STREAMLINED MODERN SYSTEMS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO DO BUSINESS WITH US AND STRENGTHEN OUR CYBERSECURITY POSITION. AND THAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS THE NEWER PLATFORMS ARE LESS EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN. WE'VE BEEN BUILDING A CULTURE THAT WILL SUPPORT OUR VISION TO BECOME CALIFORNIA'S WORKER'S COMPENSATION. CHOICE. WITH THE LIVING A BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND WE'RE PROVIDING INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP IN FIGHTING FRAUD. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT TO AREAS. WHERE WE BELIEVE WE'VE LED THE WAY IN MAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT? IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM AND WHERE WERE ABOUT TO LAUNCH A NEW TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT TO IMPROVE INJURED WORKER AND MEDICAL PROVIDER EXPERIENCE. FIRST I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A ABOUT THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC -- AND STATE FUNDS REACTION TO IT. FOR YEARS NOW THE COUNTRY'S BEEN EXPERIENCING OPIATE OPIATE AT EPIDEMIC AND IT BECAME VERY OBVIOUS THAT. WORKERS COMPENSATION WAS A HOT SPOT WHERE PEOPLE I MEAN. ADDICTED. TO PAIN KILLERS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED FOR END OF LIFE CANCER PAIN AND WE'RE BEING USED. ALL TOO FREQUENTLY. WE LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN A COMPREHENSIVE OPIOID REDUCTION STRATEGY. AND IN THAT TIME FRAME WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PRESCRIPTIONS THE INJURED WORKERS BY 71% OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS TAKING HIGH DOSES OF OPIOIDS DALY MORPHINE EQUIVALENTS BETTER DANGEROUS HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT TO ONE HUNDRED AMONGST OUR INJURED WORKERS. THE STRATEGY TOOK A TWO PRONGED APPROACH WHICH INCLUDED EARLY PREVENTION NEW CASES AND REDUCTION OF CHRONIC OPIATE USAGE AN EXISTING CASE. THE STRATEGY ALSO INCLUDED ELEMENTS SUCH AS PEER TO PEER PHYSICIAN REVIEW PROGRAMS EDUCATION FOR INJURED WORKERS ENTRY OF IT BEING PHYSICIANS. AND FUNCTIONAL RESTORATION PROGRAMS GRAINGER WORKERS TAKING CHRONIC HIGH LEVEL OF THIS EFFORT WE HAVE HELP TO IMPROVE AND POTENTIALLY SAVE THE LIVES OF MANY INJURED WORKERS. ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE UTILIZATION REVIEW WITH IS A HOT TOPIC IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. IN MAY NEXT MONTH STATE FUND WILL LAUNCH A NEW UTILIZATION REVIEW MANAGEMENT SOLUTION FOR CALLING YOU ARE CONNECTED. THIS SOLUTION EMPOWERS DOCTORS TO TREAT PATIENTS FASTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE. YOU ARE CONNECTED WILL HELP US PROVIDE DOCTORS WITH GREATER PERSPECTIVE BUT LACKS ABILITY. AND HELP REDUCE THE IMPACT OF SYSTEM WIDE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES ON INJURED WORKERS TREATMENT AND RECOVERY. YOU ARE CONNECTED RESPONSE IN REAL TIME TO DR STREET NEAR REQUEST THIS ALLOWS INJURED WORKERS TO RECEIVETHE CARE THEY NEED FASTER CIVIC AND RECOVER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW DOCTORS ARE REQUIRED TO RECEIVE AUTHORIZATION BEFORE THEY CAN PROVIDE TREATMENT AND THE LAW ALLOWS UP TO FIVE DAYS FOR THIS REVIEW. PROVIDING TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION IN REAL TIME ALLOWS DOCTORS TO ESTABLISH A TREATMENT PLAN AT THE TIME OF CARE. FOR THE INJURED WORKER KNOWS IMMEDIATE WHETHER NEXT AXLE. THIS REDUCES STRESS ON THE PATIENT AND IMPROVED TREATMENT EFFICIENCY THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING REAL TIME AUTHORIZATION FOR TREATMENT WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL TREATMENT UTILIZATION SCHEDULE THAT'S A MOUTHFUL. I AM CREATING THIS ELECTRONIC CONNECTION WITH PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS WILL ALSO ENABLE US TO PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY. TO PROVIDERS TO CUSTOMIZE TREATMENT PLANS FOR THEIR PATIENTS WHEN THEY WOULD LIKE TO TRY TREATMENT DOES NOT CLEARLY WITHIN THE GUIDELINES BUT COULD BE HELPFUL TO EXPAND IT RECOVERY. I REDUCING THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON PROVIDERS AND REDUCING THE TIME IT TAKES TO GET TREATMENT FOR INJURED WORKERS WILL BOTH REMOVE COSTS IN THE SYSTEM THAT DO NOT GO DIRECTLY TO INJURED WORKER BENEFITS AND SPEED UP TREATMENT AND RECOVERY. WITH A FOUNDATION OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS SERVING CALIFORNIA STATE FUND IS A RELIABLE PROVIDER OF WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE FOR THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES. HAVE A STRONG FOUNDATION ON WHICH WE ARE COMMITTED. TO BUILDING A MORE MODERN COMPETITOR INSURANCE KERRY WITH A HELPFUL AND RISK THE WORK FORCE AS WE CONTEMPLATE THE FUTURE WE'D LIKE EVERY OTHER OR EVERY ORGANIZATION BASED MANY CRITICAL ISSUES. SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES INCLUDE CONTINUED SUCCESSFUL INVITATION OF CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL OUR OPERATIONS THE SCALE MORE EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE. ENSURING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS MEET THE EVER GROWING. DEMAND FOR CYBERSECURITY. EXCESSIVELY LAUNCHING OUR NEW AND INNOVATIVE INCENTIVES SAFETY PROGRAMS. AND USING INNOVATION INTO THE ORGANIZATIONS ARE DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO ENSURE THE ORGANIZATION IS ACTIVELY PREPARING TO MEET SHIFTING MARKET DEMANDS. DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP SUCCESSION PLANS MISTER STATE BANS LEADERSHIP REMAINS STRONG AND CONTINUE TO ADVANCE A MATURE AN ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT REINFORCES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. INCREASE ENVIRONMENT OF RISK EDUCATED DECISION MAKING. I WILL END BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE COMING YEARS TO STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM AND HELP KEEP CALIFORNIA WORK.

TO AVOID BEING CONSERVE -- YOUR NONPROFIT AND OF ATTACHED TO THE STATE [inaudible] YOU HAVE. I'M MASSIVE CLAIMS [inaudible] SOMETHING HAPPENS. THEN YOU MAKE IT UP WITH RATE INCREASES. WELL IF WE HAD IF WE HAD KEPT. CATASTROPHIC CLAIM INVENTIVE DEPEND ON WHAT IT. WHAT IT WAS -- IF IT WAS EARTHQUAKE RELATED OR TERRORISM RELATED WE HAVE REINSURANCE. BUT GENERALLY YOU RATE INCREASES COME FROM CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS NOT CAT CATASTROPHES I MEAN SO THAT WILL. OCCUR ADAMCATASTROPHE I HAVE NOTHING IN MIND I'M JUST. WELL WHAT HAPPENS IF. YOUR RESERVES RUN LOW YOU. I'M TO US -- NO THEY WAIT A SECOND YOU KNOW WE'RE STRUGGLING OR YOUR RAISE RATES AND YOU DON'T I'M COMPETITIVE YOU BECOME LESS THAN. ELEVEN AND I WE OPERATE JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER INSURANCE CARRIER WE YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A COMPETITIVE RATE ENVIRONMENT IT BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO KEE OUR RESERVES A STRONG AND SO. ABSOLUTELY IF. IF RESULT STARTED DETERIORATE. ACTUAR ELLIE WE WOULD LOOK AT THAT AND WE WOULD FILE OF A RATE CHANGE THAT WAS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THAT BUT WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS SO THAT WE COULD WITHSTAND SOME DETERIORATION WITHOUT NEEDING ANY KIND OF A SPECIAL ASSESSMENT. WE HAVE TO CHANGE RATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER TWO THOUSAND OR WERE. CRUISING AT A I WOULD SAY WHERE IT FINANCIALLY AS STRONG AS WE'VE EVER BEEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU OFFER FOR COMING HERE TODAY AND DIET HELPS INFORM OUR DECISION AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU.
