AND WELCOME TO THE LABOR PUBLIC AND PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT -- COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY FOR THE OF THE SENATE. IBM WE WILL. BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE. A QUORUM ESTABLISHED AT THIS POINT. I WILL UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO LEAVE IN PRESENT A BILL SHORTLY AND TURN THIS OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR AS SENATOR MORALE. FOR THAT ALSO WE WILL BE ADOPTING THE WHEN WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM AT A LATER POINT IN IT BUT I DID WANT. TO MAKE THE COMMENT THAT IN THE FUTURE OUR HEARINGS WILL BE IN FILE ORDERED NOT TO SIGN IN ORDER -- AS A CONVENIENCE. TO TO MEMBERS -- SO VERY GOOD AND I SEE -- THE LIST THEY DON'T HAVE OF THE NO. THERE IT IS -- CONSIDER MORE MARKETS TO SENATOR HERTZBERG I SEE YOUR HERE PLEASE. PROCEED IF YOU WOULD WE HAVE. SENATOR HERTZBERG ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB TWO TWENTY NINE WELCOME CHAIRMAN. YES THE GERMAN INTO COMMITTEES ARCHES CONVERGE OR ISN'T THIS A MERGER. YEAH. ONE NOW. ONE NOW -- YOU KNOW SO IF YOU. IF YOU GO INTO. EVERY OFFICE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THOSE BIG. POSTERS THAT'S USUALLY REPRINTED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THAT THEY SELL IT OUTLINES THE PRINCIPLE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF EMPLOYERS AND ON THE CORNER OF THAT. IN BOLD LETTERS TALKS ABOUT THE WHISTLE BLOWERS -- FOR CALIFORNIA. AND SO. ON A COUPLE YEARS AGO I DID A WHISTLE BLOWER BUILD SO BASICALLY -- REAL LINE AND IMPROVE UPON THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY GIVING THE RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES -- THE ABILITY TO FEEL COMFORTABLE AND TELL THE TRUTH ON ON ON ISSUES THAT RELATE CAR CRITICAL -- TO PART OF THE SAFETY AND OF EMPLOYEES. AND SO NOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD YOU KNOW THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE LAWS IT'S AN EVER LIVING ORGANISM AND WE CONTINUE TO LEARN AND GROW AND COURSE CORRECT. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT BUILDS UPON THAT BILL I DID A FEW YEARS AGO THE BILL NUMBER WHICH I DON'T REMEMBER BUT AND FOCUS ON BUILDING WAS A FOCUS ON ISSUES -- BUT THE PRINCIPLE ELEMENT IS THAT THERE'S OFTEN A CHALLENGE THAT WHEN YOU WENT WHEN A WHEN AN EMPLOYEE GETS IN ORDER FOR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THEN AS A VERY CUMBERSOME PROCESS. TO REDUCE IT TO A CONTEMPLATE THAT THAN COULD BE AND ON FORCIBLE ORDER THROUGH THE SPIRIT COURT. THIS CREATES A PROCESS FOR A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE ORDER AND EXPEDITES THAT TRANSITION IF THERE'S NO OBJECTION TO IT. TO MAKE SURE THAT -- IN ORDER BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IS PROPERLY ENFORCED UNDER THE LAW UNDER THE LOS WITH THAT -- PEOPLE SMART. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. MITCH DYER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS BUT WE SPONSORED SB THREE OH SIX AND WORKED WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG'S OFFICE ON THE BILL A FEW YEARS AGO. TO PRIMARILY DEAL WITH THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WORKERS HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS WHEN THEY'VE BEEN RETALIATED AGAINST FOR REPORTING ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. IT CAN EASILY TAKE UP TO TWO TO THREE YEARS FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPEN AND SO IN THAT TIME THE WORKER HAS LIKELY. FOUND A NEW JOB THEY'VE MOVED ON TO PROBABLY HAD A FEW DIFFERENT JOBS SINCE THEN. AND SO IT ESSENTIALLY THE RETALIATION HAS WORKED IT IS SENT THE MESSAGE TO OTHER EMPLOYEES IT'S CREATED A CHILLING EFFECT TO MAKE SURE THAT. NO ONE ELSE REPORTS WHATEVER THE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WAS AND SO. A FEW AREAS HAVE. TWO TWO NINE DOES IT ADDRESSES -- A FEW ISSUES ONE OF WHICH FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT. THE BILL WAS SORT OF SILENT ON WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S SECURES A FINAL ORDER CITATION SO THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THE LAWSUIT WOULD BE NECESSARY AND THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BILL WAS. TO NOT DEAL WITH THE THREE YEAR LONG LAWSUIT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM TO DO SOMETHING MUCH FASTER AND SO WHAT SB TWO TWO NINE DOES. IS ESSENTIALLY JUST ALLOW DEAL I SEE TO ENFORCE THE CITATION NOT HAVE TO FILE A LAWSUIT. REDUCE LITIGATION TO MAKE THE PROCESS WORK FASTER AND BETTER. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT INFORMAL HEARINGS AS OPPOSED TO FORMAL HEARINGS CAN BE USED DURING THE DUE PROCESS THIS GUARANTEED TO EMPLOYERS. THIS IS THE PROCESS THAT USED IN OTHER AREAS OF THE LAW THAT ARE ENFORCED IDEALISTIC AND SO IT'S A PROCESS THAT. OTHER PEOPLE ARE USED TO ABSOLUTELY PROTECTS DUE PROCESS FOR EMPLOYERS AND USUALLY INVOLVES THE DEPUTY LABOR COMMISSIONER CONDUCTING THE HEARING RATHER THAN AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. AND THE THE IDEAL SEIZE TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUES AND THIS IS SORT OF WHAT THEY USUALLY DO AND SO. IT'S ANOTHER WAY THAT WE THINK THIS BILL WILL HELP MAKE THAT PROCESS CREATED BY SB THREE OH SIX WORK A LITTLE BIT BETTER SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. YOUR SUPPORT I'M JUST HERE FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT THREE FOR THE CALIFORNIA. ATTORNEY DAVID BALAM AN ATTORNEY FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR COMMISSIONER WE'VE REVIEWED THE THE BILL AND I'M HERE. FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT AS FOR ORDERS. RECREATION ARE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLAY MILLERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM OUR OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT HERE. QUESTION FROM THE ONES WHO ARE ARE HERE YES I DIDN'T SEE IT. GOOD MORNING AND THANK. SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT -- ASSEMBLY TIGHTENS RULES THAT ARE BENEFITING. EMPLOYEE COMPLAINANTS SO THAT BERMAN. WITHOUT A REMEDY IS NO RIGHT AT ALL -- AND IF WE CAN'T. COLLECTION THESE JUDGMENTS WHICH SAYS. ENERGY SO -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WILL PENALIZE EMPLOYERS WHO DON'T PAY A JUDGMENT WITHIN A PERIOD OF TEN DAYS. ON THE DUE PROCESS ASPECT IT. IS SAID AFTER SOME KIND OF SERVICE OR SOMETHING IN THE CASE THAT THEY THAT THEY'RE AWARE. OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO MEET ARM SO THAT JUDGMENT. AND THE SECOND PART OF THAT QUESTION IS. WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES IF THEY DO NOT PAY WITHIN TEN DAYS I'M SORRY I DIDN'T CATCH THAT? WELL SENATOR THE TEN DAYS IS A PROVISION TO APPEAL A CITATION SO IT ALLOWS LABOR COMMISSION TO ISSUE A CITATION. AND THEN THERE'S A TEN DAY PERIOD. TO APPEAL IN WHICH THEY WOULD GET IT A HEARING SO IT'S IT'S SORT OF A DUE PROCESS PROTECTION. SO THE CITATION WOULD LAY OUT THE PENALTIES. AND THEN HE WOULD GIVE THE EMPLOYER EITHER THE OPTION TO COMPLY WITH THE CITATION. OR TOO APPEALING IT HERE. SO OKAY SO IF THEY IF THEY DO NOT APPEAL THEY HAVE TO PAY WITHIN THAT IN DAYS FIVE IF THEY TO APPEAL. THEN THAT PUSHES THE TIME FRAME BACK. TO MAKE A PAYMENT ON THE ON THE JUDGMENT. WELL YEAH IT WOULD DEPEND IF THERE WOULD THEN BE HEARING IT WOULD BE A DUE PROCESS HEARING SO CONCEIVABLY EMPLOYER COULD GET A CITATION AND THEN FILE IN. OUR QUEST FOR HEARING THEN THERE WOULD BE HEARING IN THE OF THE EMPLOYER COULD PREVAIL AT THE HEARING. HOW WHAT TIMEFRAME ARE WE LOOKING AT -- IN TERMS OF WHAT IN TERMS OF THE THE HEARING -- THEY HERE YEAH. LAKE COUNTY DECISION SO IF I'M AN EMPLOYER YOU KNOW FOR SOME FOLKS THE THE THEIR PHILOSOPHY IS JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE. SO I'M WONDERING WHAT TIME FRAME ALONG WITH THAT EMPLOYERS. ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HOLD N TO THE FUNDS UNTIL THEY HAD A THE MOUSE SUB SUBSEQUENT TO A HEARING AND A DECISION I WOULD. THE THE IDEA BEHIND. THE THE ORIGINAL BILL IS THE SPEED THAT UP SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I MIGHT GIVE AN EXAMPLE AND I THINK IT'S FAIRLY AT ELEVEN OF THE OF THE ISSUE -- THE LET'S SAY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER COMES TO WORKPLACE AND DOES AN INSPECTION AND TALKS. TO THREE OR FOUR WORKERS LET'S SAY AND THEN LATER THAT AFTERNOON THOSE THREE OR FOUR WORKERS ARE TERMINATED. BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. THEN. STILL NEEDS TO DO AN INVESTIGATION UNDER THE LAW BUT CONCEIVABLY THE INVESTIGATION PROBABLY WOULDN'T TAKE VERY LONG IN SUCH A CASE RIGHT SOME RETALIATION CASES ARE ARE MUCH MORE COMPLEX. AND THAT'S WHY WE PRESERVE THE OLD PROCESS WHEREBY WE FILE A LAWSUIT. THIS THIS PROVISION ENVISIONS THE THESE MORE SORT OF STREAMLINED CASES I WOULD IMAGINE AN INVESTIGATION LIKE THAT COULD TAKE A MATTER OF DAYS. IN WHICH CASE A CITATION WOULD ISSUE THAN IT WOULD BE TEN DAYS IN WHICH TO TO APPEAR. YEAH AND THEN I THINK THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THE LAW AND AT THAT PROVIDE THAT HEARING HAS TO BE HELD WITHIN SIXTY OR NINETY DAYS. SO THAT WOULD BE -- WE KNOW THAT THE THE TIME FRAME WOULD ENVISION HOPEFULLY LESS. AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THERE'S A PROVISION WHEREBY IF AN EMPLOYER -- DOESN'T PROVIDE THAT PREVAIL AT THE HEARING THEY CAN FILE A WRIT. IN COURT BUT RATE HEARINGS ALSO TEND TO GO MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN SAY A LAWSUIT IS FILED A CIVIL COMPLAINT WHICH IS WHAT WE DO NOW AND AFTERWARDS THE BOND. AND THEY HAVE THE POST OFFICE. ONE OF THE MOST BOND TOO SURE PAYMENT THAT'S RIGHT. SO IF I'M AN EMPLOYEE AND I I'VE BEEN FIRED. ALIENATION. I'M JUST WONDERING HOW LONGER. DID THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOME KIND OF DECISION. BECAUSE FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY NEED THAT PAYCHECK. DECISION ANYWAY IMPACT. WELL THE LEGISLATION WE DID LAST TIME DRAMATICALLY STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS AND I THINK EVEN THE SIXTY OR NINETY DAYS OF THE APPEAL PROCESS IS BAD WHAT I WANTED TO DO WE WERE EXAMINING THIS WE DIDN'T GET THAT FAR. BUT ULTIMATELY AT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE DOUBLE WINDOW WHERE LITERALLY YOU GET PAID RIGHTTHERE ON THE ON THE JUDGMENT. IN IN USE INTERMEDIO BONDING AGENCY. INSURANCE COMPANY AND THEN THEY GO OUT AND COLLECT THE MONEY AND SPLIT THE BURDEN OF PROOF RIGHT SO THAT GETTING TO YOUR POINT THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WHEN SOMEBODY'S NOT PAID TO THIS WASTE AFTER SOME OTHER ISSUE OF RETALIATION. THE THEY NEED TO PAY THE RENT PAY FOR THE EXPENSES FIVE SO THE KEY IS SPEED TO GET TO A PAGE TO CHECK NOT A RIGHT NOT A A LEAN AGAINST THE BUILDING NOT. NOT A A A A LIABILITY AGAINST THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BUTA CHECK AND THEN FLIPPED THE BURDEN AND CREDIT YOU MADE A LITTLE MAKE A PROFIT TO GO COLLECT THE MONEY. RIGHT SO WEIRD BUSH WAS STILL THAT'S STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT EACH ONE OF THESE KIND OF MAKES THE PROCESS FASTER AND BETTER PARTICULARLY IN THE DEEP OKAY IN THE CASES WHERE. YOU'VE GOT TO GO IN AND AND THEN REDUCE YOUR YOU ORDER TO JUDGMENT AND YET HIS WHOLE MCGILLICUDDY WE BASICALLY EVERYWHERE WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO GET TO THE ELEMENT OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE STREAMLINING THE PROCESS OF QUICK EDUCATION ADJUDICATION TO A CHECK. RIGHT THAT'S DIFFERENT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING. TO TACTIC TIMES BY EMPLOYERS. UNDER THAT. JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE IS TO BASICALLY SAYING COME GET ME. AND THEN TODAY. THEY CAN'T HIDE THE ASSETS OR TO REQUIRE YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE NINE YARDS OR GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. SO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IN YOUR SMALLER COMPANIES OR YOU KNOW LIQUIDATING YOUR ASSETS OR THE FILING IS SOME OTHER ENTITY AND THEN YOU YOU'RE CHASING THEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME -- AND YOUR HONOR FOR THE VICTIM IS. PLAINTIFF IN THESE ACTIONS IS NOT A LOT. THAT'S WHAT WE DID BACK IN IF YOU RECALL SOME YEARS AGO WITH FARMWORKERS WITH THE SUBCONTRACTORS CASES AND THEY WERE SUBCONTRACTORS THAT THEY WOULD BE THE PEOPLE WOULD BE THE EMPLOYEES AND THEY WOULD GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND THEN YOU YOU WERE A LOCK. RIGHT YEAH THE CUT FOR THE LIABILITY NUMBER. YEAH. THE EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY IS THERE. ONCE THE CASE IS ADJUDICATED AND THEY ARE [inaudible] FILE. THOSE PHONES SO I JUST. YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S IT'S BUILT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET. READY SHE ADDED THAT. NO CALIFORNIA NO FORM YET. SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND THEN WILL CALL THE ROLL ARE YEAH WE GALA FORM. THE KOREAN CLONING OF NO I GET WITH THANK YOU SIR JUST JUST APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THINK WHERE YOU THAT YOU REALLY YOUR QUESTIONS. GET TO THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO I THINK WE MOVE MOUNTAINS. WITH OUR BILL A COUPLE OF WHEN YOU WIN THE CASE SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OF JUST. OKAY WELL I CALL THE ROLL AND WE HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT [inaudible] SERGEANTS MICHAEL. HAVE SERGEANTS CONTENT. CALL THANKS. FOR YOU PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE [inaudible] WE HAVEN'T. OKAY WHO'S NEXT ON THE LIST. WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE. TO RESENT A BILL. WAS STILL YOUNG YES GO I'M READY. THANK YOU SENATOR [inaudible] TO I DO MY BUILD. AND SHE CAN DO. AND THEN -- WHICH SHE WELCOME SENATOR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR. AND STAFF. OF THIS IS -- SB. ONE SEVENTY ONE FLIGHTS A BILL THAT CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR IT IS A BILL TO FIGHT PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA. WITH INFORMATION BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW. EQUAL PAY IS AN ISSUE I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR MANY MANY FIVE HATE TO SAY DECADES -- AND OF COURSE -- WE HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS. IN THAT REGARD AND YET THEY'RE STILL ARE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH ON EQUAL PAY. AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE ON EQUAL PAY IS OFTEN HIDDEN FROM SIGHT. NOT TRUST THE TWO EMPLOYEES BUT OFTEN TO EMPLOYERS -- WHILE PAY INEQUITY CONTINUES MOST EMPLOYERS I BELIEVE DO NOT INTEND TO DELIBERATELY SHORTCHANGE THEIR EMPLOYEES. I CAN'T THINK OF TOO MANY EMPLOYERS I COULD ENVISION WAKING UP IN THE MORNING SAYING OH GOODY HOW CAN I MAKE SURE THAT. I'M NOT PAYING WOMEN EQUALLY TO MEN I JUST THINK THAT THERE ARE IMPLICIT SITUATIONS THAT EXIST. AND THAT THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WILL TRY TO PUT A MIRROR -- TO IMPLORE YOUR PRACTICES SO THAT WE CAN -- RESOLVING CORRECT THESE DISPARITIES. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE SO. RECOGNIZING PAY DISCRIMINATION IS HARD TO DETECT IN A DRESS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED. DURING ITS TERM A PROPOSED REVISION TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPORT THAT LARGE EMPLOYERS LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS SO THIS ISN'T REALLY KNEW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS TRYING. TO EXPAND THE EMPLOYER INFORMATION REPORT THE E. O. ONE TWO IN COURT -- INCLUDE THE REPORTING OF PAY DATA. BY RACE AND BY GENDER -- BEGINNING IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE BILL OF PROVIDE THAT ADMINISTRATION AGAIN BUT IN AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUT A HALT TO THIS NEW RULE. DETAILING I SHOULD SAY TO DEALING A SIGNIFICANT BLOW TO THE EFFORT TO FIND AND TO ACHIEVE EQUAL PAY. NOW THE BREAKING NEWS IS THE TRUST THIS PAST MONTH JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO A FEDERAL JUDGE. ORDERED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO REINSTATE THIS RULE AND TO MOVE FORWARD COLLECTING THIS IMPORTANT DATA. THE WE BELIEVE THIS DECISION. MAY BE APPEALED IT APPEARS MORE AND MORE INEVITABLE THIS DATA IS GOING TO BE COLLECTED SOONER. RATHER THAN LATER AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL MAKING THE REQUEST OF THIS BILL EVEN EASIER AND CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDED UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW -- MODEL CLOSELY AFTER THE EOC ORDER SB ONE SEVENTY ONE WILL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS WITH A HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT YOUR MOM AND POP SHOP BUT A COMPANY WITH A HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES -- TO SUBMIT A PAY DATA REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION IN HOURS WORKED OF EMPLOYEES BY GENDER. RACE ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY AND I SHOULD NOTE IF THEY HAVE TO REPORT THE SAME OR SIMILAR DATA TO THE FEDS WILL ALLOW THE SUBMISSION OF THE EO ONE FORM. FOR OUR STATE AGENCIES AS WELL SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DUPLICATE THE PROCESS USING THE SAME FORM THAT EXISTS. AND THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TWO FOLD. FIRST TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES AND ALLOW FOR SELF EVALUATION AND SELF CORRECTION IN OTHER WORDS THAT LOOK IN THE MIRROR. TO TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING TOGETHER IMPORTANT DATA THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE PATTERNS OF WAGE DISPARITIES AND IF THEY NOTICED THE STEVE DEVIATIONS OR WHAT WE CALL OUT LIARS TO INVESTIGATE THEM FURTHER. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH BASED ON SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE TO NOTE THE WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO. THE BILL IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC SHAMING AND I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THAT MY GOAL HERE IS TO NOT TO SHAME ANY COMPANY BUT TO EDUCATE THEM AND TO GET THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING I BELIEVE UNTIL I'M PROVEN WRONG. THAT WHEN EMPLOYERS KNOW THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING DOES IN FACT DISCRIMINATION AND A LOT OF THAT DISCRIMINATION IS ALREADY UNLAWFUL THAT THEY WILL CORRECT THEIR POLICIES. AND THAT IS THE GOAL HERE SO IT IS NOT TO SHAME. ARE A NOR WILL IT EXPOSED EMPLOYEES PRIVATE FINANCIAL. PUBLIC AND I'VE DONE SOMETHING I DON'T USUALLY DO -- I HAVE ALSO INCLUDED THAT THIS BILL WILL PROHIBIT PUBLIC RECORD ACT DISCLOSURE. SO THE COMPANIES WE'LL BE ABLE TO DEAL HONESTLY AND ACCURATELY WITHOUT THE THE THE WORRY THAT -- THE INFORMATION WILL ULTIMATELY BE MADE AVAILABLE -- WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET SUPPORT. ON THIS OR OR THE THAT GROUPS THE GENERALLY WANT THE PUBLIC RECORDS DISCLOSURE HAVE ACCEPTED THIS I BELIEVE I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY OTHER. OBJECTION FROM THEM IT'S IT'S SORT OF A HARD PILL FOR ME TO SWALLOW BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY BUT AGAIN THE GOAL HERE IS TO GET COMPLIANCE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH -- SO OF THIS IS BEEN GOING ON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEY'VE HD NO ISSUE. WITH ON TOWARD DISCLOSURE OF THIS DATA IN THE FIFTY PLUS YEARS CENSUS FORMS BEEN IN PLACE. THIS DATA WILL PROVIDE THE BIRD'S-EYE VIEW AND PAY DISPARITY AND OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION WHICH WE BELIEVE IS PROBABLY -- ALSO A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE THE INFORMATION IS NOT INTENDED CANNOT BE USED TO ENFORCE THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY ACT WHICH I AUTHORED THAT KIND OF INFORMATION ABOUT SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK IN BONA FIDE. REASONS FOR PAY DIFFERENTIALS IS NOT PART OF THIS REPORT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ASCERTAIN. AND EMPLOYERS WILL NOT BE EXPOSED IN THAT MANNER SO THIS IS A TOOL. TO SHED LIGHT ON TRENDS IN ON THE BIG PICTURE -- EQUAL PASTING IN THE LONG CALIFORNIA FOR SEVENTY YEARS IT RECENT TO THE STUDIES PREDICT WE'RE STILL NOT MOVING TOWARDS -- THAT GOAL WE MAY NOT GET IT. FOR GOODNESS ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS IF WE DO NOT MAKE THESE CHANGES 40% OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE WOMEN IS THE SOUL OF WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES AND WE SHOULD BE PAID EQUALLY AND FAIRLY FOR THE WORK WE DO. THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE TOOLS IN THE TOOL KIT AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK WE HAVE A QUORUM SO SECRETARY WOULD YOU LIE TAKE THE ROLE SENATOR HILL. MORRELL MORRELL HERE JACKSON HERE JACKSON HERE MITCHELL HERE MITCHELL HERE PAT. AND HERE WE HAVE A QUORUM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE A QUORUM -- SUPPORTERS WOULD YOU LIKE. TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARIE GO YOSHIHARU OUT WITH THE ASSOCIATION WHERE PRADA CO SPONSOR THIS BILL. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS JUST GO OVER PROVIDE A LITTLE BACKGROUND BEHIND THE PAID THE FEDERAL PAY DATA REPORTING RULE AND JUST EXPLAIN WHY THESE REPORTS WILL HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE ONGOING RACE AND GENDER WAGE GAPS? SO FIRST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FULLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT WENT INTO THE FEDERAL REPORTING REVISED -- FOR EO ONE REPORTS SO THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION THE EOC BACK IN -- TWO THOUSAND TEN JOIN OTHER EDERAL AGENCIES TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO BETTER SO THAT THEY CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY TO ENFORCE OUR HE DISCRIMINATION LAWS. AND SO BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THEY ISSUED A STUDY -- THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ISSUED A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. TALKING ABOUT THE VALUE OF ENFORCEMENT OF COLLECTION OF PAY DATA FOR FROM EMPLOYERS BY SEX RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN. THROUGH A SURVEY SUCH AS THE EO ONE THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT THE EEOC CONDUCT A PILOT STUDY. TO INFORM THE PARAMETERS OF A PAY DATA COLLECTION WHICH THEY DID AND THIS -- THIS PILOT STUDY MADE TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT CENTRAL COMPONENTS OF PAY DATA COLLECTION INCLUDING THE UNIT OF PAY TO BE COLLECTED THE BEST SUMMARY MEASURES OF RATES OF PAY. APPROPRIATE STATISTICAL TESTS FOR ANALYZING PAY DATA REPORTS AND THE MOST EFFICIENT AND LEAST COSTLY METHODS FOR TRANSMITTING PAY DATA FROM EMPLOYERS. AND SO ACCORDING TO THE EEOC IS CALCULATION IT ONLY TAKES FIFTEEN HOURS FOR THESE REPORTS TO BE PUT TOGETHER. AND THE EDT IS MOST RECENT DATA SHOWS THAT LESS THAN 2% OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES HAVE A HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES. GET THAT COVERS THE EMPLOYEE 44% OF CALIFORNIANS WORK FORCE SEVERAL ONLY IMPACTING A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA YET WERE POTENTIALLY BENEFITING ALMOST HALF OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT KEEP IN MIND THAT EMPLOYERS ARE ALREADY GEARING UP TO PRESENT HIS REPORTS ANYWAY. BEFORE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUT A HALT TO IT AND I SENATOR JACKSON MENTIONED THERE WAS A RECENT GOOD DECISION AND ON THE DC COURT -- THERE WAS A A BLOG FROM A ONE OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYER DEFENSE FIRMS THAT -- WROTE AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE RECENT DC DECISION BUT THEN ALSO WROTE THAT THERE'S A REPRIEVE BECAUSE THE EO ONE FORMS HAVEN'T BEEN UPDATED H BUT WHAT THIS ARTICLE SAID IT ADVISED EMPLOYERS THAT THEY SHOULD QUOTE STILL BE PREPARED FOR THIS TO CHANGE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE AND SHOULD BEGIN PREPARING FOR SUCH PAY DISCLOSURES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A PRETTY BROAD UNDERSTANDING FROM EVEN WITHIN THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY THAT THESE PAY DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WILL EVENTUALLY GO INTO A FACT ALL THIS BILL DOES IS GET THINGS MOVING. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE REAL QUICKLY WHAT IS INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUAL PAY WE TYPICALLY TALK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF WHAT IS EMPLOYEE A WHO IS A WOMAN A PERSON OF COLOR. MAKING COMPARED TO EMPLOYEE BE WHO IS A WHITE MAN AND IS THERE A WAGE DISPARITY IN CANNOT BE EXPLAINED. AND OFTEN THERE IS AN UNLAWFUL WAGE DISPARITY IN THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL WAGE GAP. BUT WHAT GETS LESS ATTENTION BUT IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION AND HIRING AND PROMOTION PATTERNS THAT ARE CAUSING WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR TO BE. OVERLY REPRESENTED AN OVERLY CONCENTRATED IN THE LOWEST PAYING JOBS. SO. WHAT THIS BILL WILL DEAL WITH THESE REPORTS WILL DO WILL GIVE US THAT HIGH LEVEL LOOKS SO WE CAN SEE WHERE THOSE PAY PATTERNS EXIST WE'VE SEEN LARGE EMPLOYERS LIKE SALES FORCE THE GAP STARBUCKS VOLUNTARILY PUT TOGETHER THESE PAY AUDIT REPORTS AND WHAT? THEY WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT IT ALLOWS THEM TO IDENTIFY WHERE THERE ARE WEAK SPOTS. WHERE OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION IS IMPACTING THE OVERALL WAGE DISTRIBUTION AND AGAIN IS IT CAUSING WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR TO BE OVERLY CONCENTRATED OVERLY REPRESENTED IN THESE LOWER PAYING JOBS WHEN YOU HAVE? 80% OF ALL AGES GOING TO HANDFUL WHITE MEN. NOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'S AN EQUAL PACKED BY ELATION NOT NECESSARILY -- BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THOSE EMPLOYER SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THEIR PAY PRACTICES THEIR PROMOTION PRACTICES TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY THOSE PATTERNS IS IT EXIST AND WHAT THEY CAN DO BETTER -- AND IN TERMS OF HOW THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING CAN USE THIS DATA. THEY CAN LOOK AT PATTERNS ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND WITHIN INTO INDUSTRIES SO HOW DOES THE TECH SECTOR COMPARED TO THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR. WHO HAS THE HIGHEST PAID JOBS WHO HAS THE LOWEST PAID JOBS? AND IT ALSO WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING TO IDENTIFY THE OUTLIERS WITHIN INDUSTRIES ARE THERE COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY SHOWING THAT SAY. ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOYEES OR WOMEN ARE PAID 3240% LESS THAN ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE MEN. AND AGAIN DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'S AN EAGLE PAD VIOLATION OR PAY DISCRIMINATION VIOLATION NOT NECESSARILY BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT IT SHOULD DESERVE FURTHER SCRUTINY IN THIS THAT'S WHAT THIS THESE REPORTS WERE ALLOWED OUR STATE AGENCIES TO DO. SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE TOOL THAT WILL PROMPT US HISTORY CHANGES AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE THAT DONE THIS VOLUNTARILY. AND SERVER THESE REASONS WE ARE STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ENERGY ABOUT EITHER. GOOD MORNING SHANNON SMITH CROWLEY REVERSING THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO ADD THE TERRIFIC TEST MANY ONE THING ON ON THE EAGLE -- ONE FORM THOUGH I DID WANT TO I THOUGHT. I TOOK NOTE OF WAS I THINK IT WAS AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX DOLLARS PER EMPLOYER PER YEAR. TO FILE THIS THIS ADDITIONAL FORM. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS. SENATOR JACKSON SAID. IT IS TAKING SO LONG TO CLOSE THE GENDER PAY GAP IN FACT. THE MOST RECENT DATA FROM AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN WOMEN -- LOOKING AT THE DATA FROM WAY BEFORE THAT WE SAID WAS GOING TO TAKE ABOUT FIFTY YEARS TO CLOSE THE GENDER PAY GAP. LOOKING AT THE MORE RECENT DATA. IT'S A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS. WE ALSO LOOK AT WHY. THAT WERE HAVING THIS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE STUDIES THAT SAY. ONLY ABOUT 6212% OF THIS. IS BELIEVED TO BE OUT RIGHT DISCRIMINATION OR BIAS. BUT IT'S NOT THE EMPLOYER WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AND HOW AM I GOING TO PAY PAY WOMEN LESS. ITS PERPETUATION OF THE STATUS QUO AND WE'VE DONE A LOT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS FOR INSTANCE -- LIMITING THE USE OF ASKING SOMEBODY ABOUT THEIR PRIOR SALARY IF IT WAS LOW IT JUST IS GOING TO CONTINUE INTO THEIR NEXT JOB. BUT A LOT OF IT IS JUST LIKE. TAKING YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE YOU NEED TO TREAT. UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY HAPPEN HAVEN'T MEASURED. SO THIS -- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF WOMEN'S IN OF THE LONG TERM ECONOMIC. IMPACT ON WOMEN IN THEIR FAMILY'S BEEN ABLE TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT. BEING ABLE TO TO HELP PAY FOR CHILDREN SCHOOL AND LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF WOMEN RIGHT NOW THAT ARE ON A LOT OF PUBLIC BENEFITS. THEY WOULDN'T NEED TO BE ON THAT IF THEY WERE MAKING EQUAL PAY. SO WE HAVE THREE I HAVE A NEITHER. MR WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. I ANGER I'M A SILLY OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. GEN GARY FROM THE LATE AT WORK AND SUPPORT. ANY IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MANY MEMBERS AND STAFF WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME'S LAURA CURTIS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. FIRST I DO WANT TO COMMENT THAT THIS BILLS VERSION LAST YEAR WAS A CAL CHAMBER JOB KILLER -- THE AUTHOR WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH US IN GOOD FAITH TO AMEND THE BILL AND IN ORDER TO ADD THOSE PROVISIONS THAT SHE DISCUSSED REGARDING THE RECORDS REQUEST ACT AND AND OTHER ITEMS -- AND SO WE ARE STILL IN IN A POST POSITION THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND THE REASON BEING IS THAT YES WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW OR THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE NOW SAID. THAT TO THE EO ONE REPORT WILL BE REQUIRED WE ARE AM. KILLED AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT APPEAL PROCESS WILL GO ON AND SO THAT'S OUR CONCERN AS OF RIGHT NOW WITH REGARD TO THAT UNDERLYING ISSUES WITH THIS FORM AND THE REQUIREMENTS. ARE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY SHOW THE WAGE DISPARITY AND THAT THE EQUAL PAY ACT WAS GOING AFTER AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO CHAU UNLAWFUL WAGE DISPARITY -- YOU ACTUALLY FOR THE MOST PART WE DO WE DON'T WANT UNLAWFUL WHICH SEVERITY BUT WE DO WANT WAGE DISPARITY IN SOME REGARD YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES MORE IF THEY'VE BEEN WITH THE COMPANY FOR LONGER SO IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN THERE FOR TWO WEEKS. VERSUS SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN WITH YOU FOR THIRTY YEARS YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO REWARD THAT PERSON THEY WOULD HAVE THE EXACTSAME JOB TITLE SO ON THIS REPORT IT WOULD SHOW THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL WAS MAKING MORE AND ONE INDIVIDUALS MAKING LESS. AND REGARDING GENDER THAT COULD BE SHOWN THAT THE MALES MAKING MORE OF THE FEMALES MAKING MORE BUT THIS AGGREGATE DATA IS NOT GOING TO SHOW WHY THOSE TO AND DIFFERENTIALS ARE THERE. SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THIS PERSON HAS BEEN THERE FOR LONGER OR THIS PERSON HAD CAME IN WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OR ANY OF THOSE ISSUES AND SO. THAT'S ARE CONCERNED THAT IT'S GOING TO SHOW THE WAGE -- DISPARITY BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE UNLAWFUL WAGE DISPARITY -- ADDITIONALLY WITH THAT -- WE DO FEEL THAT SB ONE SEVENTY ONE IS PREMATURE IN THAT THE PAY EQUITY TASK FORCE IS STILL COMING OUT WITH THE REPORTS. ON THE EQUAL PAY ACT AND ENFORCEMENT ON THAT ACT AND WHAT THAT -- BUT THE THEIR COMMENTS ON THAT AND SO WE THINK THAT UNTIL THOSE REPORTS ARE OUT AND BEEN ANALYZED IN THE PACKWOOD HE TAUGHT AND THE BAD EQUAL PACKED HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR LONGER. ALLOWED EMPLOYERS TO COMPLY THEN AND THIS BILL IS PREMATURE AND THAT IT MIGHT REQUIRE THE ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR EMPLOYERS ARE IN LINE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CRISTINA KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION SORRY CENTER MITCHELL AT MY BACK TO YOU HERE -- I WANTED TO A THE MECHANICS OF THE BILL IF YU WILL -- I THINK IS YOUR COMMITTEE HAS NOTED WELL ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS. THE COMMITTEE MAY WISH TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLARITY -- ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE EO ONE FORM IN COMPLIANCE WITH SB -- ONE SEVEN ONE I'VE DRAFTED SOME SUGGESTED LANGUAGE OR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER BUT THE POINT IS IN SUBDIVISION HALF. OF THE BILL TO MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT THE ANNUAL FILING OF THE EO ONE FORM WOULD BE DEEMED. TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SB. ONE SEVEN ONE THE SECOND AMENDMENT THAT YOUR COMMITTEE SUGGESTS AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE. SEVEN WOULD CONCUR WITH THAT WE MERE THE FEDERAL PENALTIES FOR DISCLOSURE BY GOVERNMENTAL EMPLOYEES. THE LAST ITEM IS IN SECTION ONE OF THE BILL SUBDIVISION F. AS WELL IN THE LAST SENTENCE -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE STRUCK THE OR THROUGH THE NORMAL RULES OF DISCOVERY IN A CIVIL ACTION. I THINK THE GOAL HERE IS TO ENSURE IN FACT THAT THIS INFORMATION WILL NOT BE DISCLOSED. CLEARLY THE AUTHOR HAS INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. IT SHOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE. TO LATEST COUNCIL -- EITHER IN THAT REGARD. AND THEN THE SECOND POINT IS CONCEPTUAL IDLE KNOW IF ANYONE'S HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE AEO ONE FORM. BUT USE UTILIZES BROAD JOB CATEGORIES. AND IT'S AN AGGREGATE NUMBER. SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THE INFORMATION IN FACT I WOULD PROBABLY -- AGREE THAT IT WILL LIKELY SHOW A DISPARITY -- WHEN YOU AGGREGATE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE? CATEGORIES YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PEOPLE AT THE LOW END OF THE PAY SCALE TO THE HIGH END OF THE PAY SCALE. AND REMEMBER WHEN WE WORK DILIGENTLY WAS WAS SENATOR JACKSON AND SOME OF THE PROPONENTS OF THIS EXACT BILL ONE OR SB. THREE FIFTY EIGHT THE WE CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF EQUAL PAY FOR I'M SORRY YES EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK TO EQUAL PAY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR. USING THOSE BROAD CATEGORIES DOES NOT. DO THAT OKAY DOESN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. A SUBSTANTIALLY COMPARABLE TYPE INFORMATION BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT AGGREGATE DATA DOESN'T IN ANY WAY ALLOW. FOR THE BONAFIDE FACTORS IS THE WAGE DISPARITY LAWFUL THAT'S THE KEY. AND SB THREE FIFTY EIGHT CODIFIED THINGS LIKE EXPERIENCE EDUCATION TRAINING AS BONAFIDE FACTORS. NOW IF YOU CAN'T DO ANY BONAFIDE FACTORS THEN CLEARLY IS UNLAWFUL PAY DISPARITY. AND THERE'S YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE LAW IS TODAY BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS AGGREGATE DATA IS GOING TO BE A PANACEA. TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS WAGE DISPARITY THAT IS UNLAWFUL THANK YOU. SENATOR YOU WINNING. JACKSON. OPPOSITION I'M SORRY YEAH CAN STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION. ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MOVE THE BILL. SENATOR WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO ACCEPT. THE AMENDMENT TO CLARIFY ON THAT HE I'M WILLING TO DISCUSS. ANYTHING THAT WILL. CONTINUE -- TO MOVED TO BUILD AND PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL THE PARTIES IS I'VE ARTICULATED WHAT OUR INTENTION IS I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION. AND I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO CONTINUE TALKING WITH THEM. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. SENATOR PAN THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON FOR RAIN THIS BILL FORD AND AND PROJECT AS AN EDUCATION MAY BUT JUST TO CLARIFY I MEAN BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE YOU'RE JUST ASKING HIM AGAIN MEMBER SAW THIS BILL BEFORE YES IS IS THAT THE EO ONE WHICH COMPANY HAS TO READY. COMPILE CELLS NOT DIGITAL WORK -- ACTUALLY BE SUPPLIED TO THE APPROPRIATE. STATE AGENCY DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT CORRECT AND THAT INFORMATION IS. CAP -- I MEAN IT KEPT CONFIDENTIAL FOR INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES YES THEY CAN REPORT ACCURATELY RIGHT SO THE DEFEAT THE REPORTING WOULD BE TO DEPARTMENT FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSE RIGHT OKAY AND SO. AND SO. I REALIZE THAT THE STATE ISN'T PERFECT RIGHT -- IT'S THERE. IT DEALT. IF SOMEONE WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING TO LET'S SAY PUNISH A COMPANY OR SOMETHING FOR SOMETHING THEY WOULD DELVE DEEPER DAY WHEN USE THAT AS THE SOLE SOURCE BUT I MEAN IT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO KIND OF SCAN AND SEE WHAT THE OVERALL PICTURE IS. IS THAT IS THAT IN MY EXACTLY RIGHT IT AND NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE SP THREE FIFTY EIGHT WHICH TIME. AWARE OF WE'RE NOT LOOKING HERE. T SEE IF COMPANIES ARE VIOLATING ARE EQUAL PAY ACT. SO THE I I I WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT CONFUSING THE TO THIS IS TO LOOK AT SORT OF A THE THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW -- IT DESIGNED IN GREAT MEASURE TO GIVE COMPANIES INFORMATION THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OFF IN THAT. THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES THE OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION WHICH WE BELIEVE. PUBLICLY DOES EXIST IN MANY COMPANIES AND THEN TO ALSO LOOK AT OUT LIARS WHERE IT MIGHT BE -- EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT ALLOWING COMPANIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS -- IT AGAIN THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY. DO TO WAGE DISPARITIES THAT ARE UNLAWFUL THAT THE REFERENCE IT WAS MADE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE THERE ARE OFTEN TIMES GOOD JUSTIFICATIONS FOR WHY PEOPLE. ARE PAID DIFFERENTLY -- I SUSPECT WHAT WE'LL FIND IS THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE MALE EMPLOYEES. WHITE MALE EMPLOYEES HAVE GOTTEN INCREASES OVER FEMALE EMPLOYEES WHO MAY BE MORE QUALIFIED MORE EXPERIENCED AT SCEPTER BUT THAT'S HOW WITH THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO. OKAY TO LOOK AT THE THE THE BIG PICTURE. TO TO HAVE COMPANIES OF VALUE WAIT IF AND WHY. THEY HAVE SUCH JOB SEGREGATION -- N. N. IN HOPES THAT THEY WILL CORRECT THOSE FOR THAT THEY WILL WORK AFFIRMATIVELY TO CORRECT THOSE. INSTANCES WHERE TO ALLOW D. FBIH IF THERE'S AN EXAMPLE AND OUT LIAR WHERE THEY'RE AT THE SITUATION IS MORE EXTREME TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON I WON'T BE HERE IN A HUNDRED YEARS AND NEITHER WILL JUST ABOUT ANYBODY. ELSE. BUT WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THIS BATTLE FOR EQUAL PAY FOR SEVENTY YEARS NOW AND WE ARE NOT GETTING TO THE WE'RE NOT SEEING. OF THE FINISH LINE AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO REPLACE -- THREE FIFTY EIGHT EQUAL PAY IT IS JUST ANOTHER TOOL THAT WILL ALLOW US AND CALIFORNIA'S I'M STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT. 44% OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE WORKS ONLY WITHIN 2% OF THE EMPLOYERS. THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG COMPANIES OUT THERE THAT ARE -- NEEDING TO KNOW JUST EXACTLY WHETHER THEY% ARE. HELPING OR **** INCREASING THE PROBLEM ON PAY EQUITY AND AND AND THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. AND IN JUST ONE OTHER ISSUE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THIS INFORMATION FOR COMPANY HAVE TO BE RECORD IS. KEPT CONFIDENTIAL CELLS.

THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH. OKAY SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I'LL USE THAT AS MY CLOTHES -- THIS BILL CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT THIS YEAR -- WE CAN MOVE THE BALL FORWARD THE RECENT DECISION BY THE COURT IT MAY BE APPEALED ALL THE MORE REASON FOR CALIFORNIA TO AGAIN BE IN THE FOREFRONT.

BUT IN PRACTICE ALMOST ALL THOSE GRIEVANCES. FOR THE NIGHT THE RECORDS. IS TO THE COURT. THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD. THAT'S TIME CONSUMING THAT'S COSTLY. AND THEREFORE DISCOURAGES. FROM DOING THAT. WHICH ONLY HAPPENS FURTHER. THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE USE. WHAT I CALL SOMEONE FORGOTTEN EMPLOYEES HAVE GOT TO INDOOR? THIS BILL WILL. OPTIMIZE AND STREAMLINE. THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS. ALLOWING EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES TO REQUEST ARBITRATION. AFTER THEY EXHAUST THE NORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES. THERE THEN WOULD BE ACTIVATED AND THE GOOD [inaudible] ASK. FOR THEN THE ARBITRATION. THERE'S AN INCENTIVE IN THIS. UTILIZING THE LOSER PAY MODEL. THAT WOULD HELP. FILTER A FRIVOLOUS [inaudible] POINT. IT INCENTIVIZE GROUPS THE SHUTTLE. AMONG THE REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES WHO. HAVE THE ABILITY NOW. THERE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY. TO REQUEST ARBITRATION. WE'VE TAKEN SOME. MINOR BUT SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL CHANGES. CONFIRMING CONFORMING TO THE H. R. AGREEMENT THE ARBITRATION PROCESS [inaudible] IT WILL. I THINK GIVE THESE [inaudible] NEGLECTED OR NOT IS. RESPECTED EMPLOYEES A BETTER OPPORTUNITY [inaudible] TO ANTICIPATE.

THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. AND STATE THAT I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THE SUGGESTED TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS SHOULD THIS BILL GET OUT TODAY. SB TWO SIXTY SIX PROTECTS THE PROMISED AND PAID FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF CALPERS MEMBERS. BY MAKING SURE THE ANY COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED COMPENSATION COUNTED TOWARDS RETIREMENT CANNOT BE TAKEN FROM RETIREE BECAUSE OF INCORRECTLY REPORTED INFORMATION BY THEIR EMPLOYERS. THIS MAJOR RESPONSE TO CASES IN WHICH THE COMPENSATION INFORMATION OF RETIRED EMPLOYEES WAS INCORRECTLY REPORTED TO CALPERS BY THEIR EMPLOYERS. IN THESE INSTANCES THE RETIRED EMPLOYEES ARE FORCED TO PAY BACK THE TOTAL OVER PAID AMOUNT AND SUFFER PERMANENT REDUCTIONS TO THEIR PENSIONS. MANY RETIREES RELY ON FIXED INCOMES I WOULD SAY MOST RETIREES RELY ON FIXED INCOMES. AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE UNEXPECTED CUTS TO THEIR BENEFITS BECAUSE THE REPORTING ERRORS. NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. SB TWO SIXTY SIX GIVER TECH GIVES RETIREES PEACE OF MIND FROM BEING FORCED TO PAY BACK MONEY OR HAVE REDUCTIONS IN THE PENSIONS BECAUSE OF ACCOUNTING OR REPORTING ERRORS. BY THEIR EMPLOYER SB TWO SIXTY SIX COME HEALTH CALPERS AND EMPLOYERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP RETIREES HOLE AND PREVENT THESE INSTANCES FROM EVER HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE CALPERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE HERE WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IT'S CHRISTY BELMONT WITH THE CALIFORNIA FRACTIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. WHO ARE SPONSORS OF SB? TWO SIXTY SIX AND FRANKLY. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY BOMB ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS PLEASED TO BE. SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE -- WE WERE IN FOR THE FIRST COMMITTEE BEFORE THIS BECAME A JOINT COMMITTEES THE UNDER A CHAIRMAN PAN AND A WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT LAST YEAR. WE GOT A GOVERNOR VETO WHICH WE HAVE ADDRESSED IN THE LANGUAGE SUGGESTS THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ENGAGEMENT ABOUT WHAT APPEARS AN ANIMAL YOU AND ALSO SUGGESTS THAT -- PURRS CAN PERIODICALLY PUBLISH INFORMATION ABOUT NUMBER WITH YOU LANGUAGE THEY'VE APPROVED STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS -- AND THEN I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THAT THESE MEMBERS WHO ARE THESE RETIREES I SHOULD SAY WHO ARE. BEING ASKED TO PAY BACK -- THIS MONEY THEY PAID FOR THIS BENEFIT HAS TO THEIR EMPLOYERS AND IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF A BARGAINING AGREEMENT. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AGAIN WHOSE DISH. SURE MEMBERS RAINY PERRY ON BEHALF OF PORAC AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MENTION THAT -- IT REMINDED COMMITTEES RETIRED MEMBERS WHO NOT ONLY THROUGH FOR NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN BUT AS AS CHRIS ABOUT MIGHT SAID -- PAID THE BENEFIT BARGAIN THE BENEFIT AND NOW WE ASK HIM MANY TIMES A LUMP SUM PAYMENT SET FINANCIALLY -- IMPACT THEM SO WE JUST ASK FOR SUPPORT. HI ANY ADDITIONAL IN SUPPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CHAI SUPPRESS IT WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION -- SUPPORT THIS BILL FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED AND STATEMENT AND IT AFFECTS CLASSIFY SCHOOL IS ALSO NOT PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSONAGE STEIGER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. MR MEMBERS TERRY BRENNAN BEHALF OF S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. SHERMAN ALBERTO TRICKLE MATHIS TAKE COLLISION PREVENTION ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT. MORNING RAIN CHAMBER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. MORNING PJ WEB WITH THE LOS ANGELES SCHOOL POLICE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. ANY IN OPPOSITION. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE STILL GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- THIS BILL IS DIFFERENT THAN THE BILL THAT WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR LAST YEAR -- WHEN IS THAT COMING TO TO THIS COMMITTEE IT WOULD HAVE HAD CALPERS CONTINUE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO RETIREES? AND EMPLOYERS CONTINUE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CALPERS -- THIS BILL IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THAT IT HAS -- EMPLOYERS MAKING PAYMENTS DIRECTLY -- TO RETIREES -- THIS IS AN UNFORTUNATE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THE AS THE SENATOR POINTED OUT -- RETIREES WHO HAVING THEIR THEIR PAYMENTS CUT FROM CALPERS. IS INCREDIBLY UNFORTUNATE THESE WERE THEY WERE RECEIVING BENEFITS THAT WERE BARGAINED BETWEEN THE BARGAINING UNITS IN THE EMPLOYERS -- EVERYONE WAS IN AGREEMENT -- EVERYONE WAS MAKING THEIR PAYMENTS TO CALPERS IN THESE RETIREES WERE RECEIVING THAT BENEFIT -- THEN AFTER SOME SOMETIME CALPERS DETERMINED THAT THE BENEFITS THAT WERE BARGAINED FOR AND AGREED -- TO AND PAY FOR TO CALPERS WERE UNLAWFUL -- AND THEY THEN CALPERS IS REQUIRED TO GO BACK AND SEE KID'S -- THOSE UNLAWFUL PAYMENTS THAT WENT TO THE RETIREES -- THE WITH THE WAY THIS WORKS IS -- AFTER THE EMPLOYERS -- COME TO AN AGREEMENT THE WITH THE BARGAINING UNIT THEY SUBMIT THEIR CONTRACT TO CALPERS -- THERE IS THE EMPLOYER START PAYING THEIR SHARE. THE EMPLOYEES ARE PAYING THEIR SHARE -- THEN WHEN THEY RETIRED CALPERS PAYS THE EMPLOYEES THE RETIREE. BOTH THE EMPLOYEES HERE -- THAT THEY PAID AND AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYER SHARE. THEN WITH THIS BILL THIS WOULD HAVE THE EMPLOYERS. HEY CALPERS FOR THE THE BENEFIT THEY'VE BEEN RECEIVED -- BY THE RETIREE. FOR NOT ONLY THE EMPLOYER'S SHARE AGAIN. BUT THE RETIREES SHARE. AS WELL. AND THEN -- THEY WOULD HAVE TO DIRECTLY CONTINUE TO PAY THE RETIREE. A D. UNLAWFUL BENEFIT. AND THIS IS WHERE. OUR AGENCIES -- FOUND THAT IT'S A GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS TO CONTINUE TO DIRECTLY PAY. A RETIREE. A A. B. AND UNLAWFUL BENEFITS -- AND FOR FOR THOSE REASONS WE'RE OPPOSED -- CALPERS IS ALREADY DETERMINED THAT THEY CAN'T PAY THIS CONTINUED PAY THIS BENEFIT BECAUSE IT IS UNLAWFUL. AND YET THIS BILL WOULD. HAVE EMPLOYERS TO PAY THEIR SHARE AGAIN AND THEN CONTINUE TO PAY. EMPLOYEES -- THIS PUTS 1100%. OF THE COST FOR AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN A BARGAINING UNIT AT AN EMPLOYER ON THE EMPLOYER. FOR THOSE REASONS WERE POST. SURE MEMBERS DATE HUTCHINGS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES LIE MY COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION -- THAT ALSO TAKE -- YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME -- ISSUE WITH THE FACT THAT -- THE THE REPORTED ABOUT WAS MADE ON THE AIR WHERE I'M AS MISTER GIVENS STATED -- THESE WERE AGREEMENTS ARE MADE BY THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE I'M CALPERS REVIEWS THOSE AGREEMENTS AND MAKES THE DETERMINATION OF THOSE PENSION AT THOSE -- THAT CONVERSATIONS PENSION OR NOT -- THEN THEM. THEN GOING BACK IN MAKING A DETERMINATION LATER SAYING THEY WERE NO LONGER PENSIONABLE -- DOESN'T SO MUCH FOR THE ONUS ON THE EMPLOYERS. CAN SEE -- WHO SIGNED OFF ON THE AGREEMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO WE ARE ORGANIZATIONS DID NOT TAKE A POSITION ON THE MEASURE WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY PRODUCED LAST YEAR -- WE VOICE OUR CONCERNS FOR THE MEASURE ONCE OF HIS AMENDED AND AND AND AUGUST -- TO TO PUT THE EMPLOYER ON THE HOOK FOR FOR THAT THAT BENEFIT -- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER -- IS IS TAKING A LOOK AT FROM FROM A PROSPECTIVE BASIS ONE OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT WE CAN DO ON THE FRONT TEND TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN -- BUT WITH REGARDS TO THE RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY OF THIS MEASURE -- WE CERTAINLY HAVE OUR CONCERNS AS OUTLINED BY MISTER GIVENS -- SO WITH THAT THE LADY CITIES AS OPPOSED MEASURE THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER AND OPPOSITION. JOSH DUGGAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED. QUESTION FOR MEMBERS. I'M JUST WONDERING -- THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE EMPLOYEE -- YOU DON'T WANT TO THE EMPLOYER TO TO HAVE TO PAY FOR TO TO JUST FOR THAT. WHO WHO WHO SUPPOSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IMPAIR THE BURDEN? THAT'S WHAT CONFUSES ME HI. I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE THE EMPLOYEE IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT -- THE EGG. YOU KNOW THE COUNTY DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT EVEN THOUGH IT. MAY BE THEIR FAULT AND COULD YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE PUTTING THIS BURDEN ON THE EMPLOYEE SO THE QUESTION BECOMES WHO WE PUT IT ON I WOULD SAY THAT I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU SENATOR JACKSON. THIS IS THROUGH NO FAULT OF THE EMPLOYEE YOU WORK TWENTY FIVE THIRTY THIRTY FIVE FORTY YEARS YOU GO IN TO FIND OUT WHAT YOUR PENSION IS GOING TO BE. SOMEONE NOT YOURSELF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE PENSION CALCULATION AS A ORKER SOMEONE CALCULATE YOUR PENSION YOU'RE TOLD YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS -- PER MONTH FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE FOR WHATEVER THE TIME FRAME IS. AND THEN COME TO FIND OUT A YEAR TWO YEARS TEN YEARS LATER IT'S DISCOVERED THAT WHOEVER CALCULATED IT. MISCALCULATED IT AND NOW THE EMPLOYING SUPPOSED TO PAY THAT MONEY BACK AND THAT IS THROUGH NO FAULT OF THE EMPLOYEE PEOPLE MAKE LIFE DECISIONS ON WHAT THEY'RE TOLD. OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE BUT I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE THE EMPLOYEE SHOULD NOT BE ON THE HOOK AND I KNOW THE EMPLOYER DOESN'T LIKE THAT IDEA. THAT THEY WOULD BE ON THE HOOK BUT YOU'RE CORRECT WHO ELSE SHOULD BE ON THE HOOK FOR THE MONEY. LET'S MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT SO THE SYSTEM WELL THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING WHO WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR GETTING IT RIGHT. I MEAN I'M ASSUMING THEY'RE PROBABLY INSTANCES WHERE EMPLOYEES ARE PAID LESS THAN THE WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED. TO BECAUSE WE ALL I MEAN I LOOK AT SOCIAL SECURITY THEY TELL YOU WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET. AND YOU BASICALLY SAY OKAY -- IF THAT'S WHAT I GET THAT'S WHAT I GET AND YOU ASSUME THERE RIGHT WHERE DO YOU GO TO FIND OUT TO GET THAT SECOND OPINION. I MEAN SHOULD WE BE EXPECTING EMPLOYEES TO GET A SECOND OPINION I DON'T THINK SO BUT BUT WHAT YOU KNOW. IF I MAY OF SENATOR. YOUR QUESTIONS ARE RIGHT ON POINT I MEAN I DID HEAR. THAT IT'S MORE MAKING THIS UNDER PERCENT THE OBLIGATION OF THE EMPLOYER AND THAT'S APPROPRIATELY SO THE EMPLOYER BARGAIN THIS FORM OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION FOR THIS GROUP OF EMPLOYEES. AND SO WHEN IT'S DETERMINED THAT IT'S DISALLOWED I'M NOT SURE WHY THIS LANDS ON THE EMPLOYER BUT THE EMPLOYER DOES HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ACCURATELY REPORT. WHAT IS PENSION WILL COMPENSATION TO THE SYSTEM? SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHO DECIDES WHAT IS THAT A PENSIONABLE AMOUNT TOWARD WHERE DO WE GO TO GET THAT ACCURATE INFORMATION PERHAPS. WE SHOULD PUT THE ONUS ON THEM I I BELIEVE CALPERS ALCULATES THE RETIREMENT AMOUNT. ALSO SOMEONE FROM CALPERS HERE WHO CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. IF I MAY THE PREVIOUS POINT -- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS BILL DOES PARTICULARLY WELL IS IT ASK CALPERS TO DO A REVIEW A REVIEW OF THE THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN FUTURE CONTRACTS -- ADD TO TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE -- HOWEVER AS FAR AS THE THE OWNERS OF OF PUTTING THIS ON THE WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT IS -- THIS THIS DOES PUT THIS OTHER PERSON ON EMPLOYER RIGHT NOW CALPERS HAS THE ABILITY. AND HAS IN THE PAST WAVE TO THEIR THEIR LOVE SOME OF THE THE THE AMOUNT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID TO THE EMPLOYEE -- THEY'VE THEY'VE SENT TO A BILL ASKING FOR BACK AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO WAIVE THAT AMOUNT THEY'VE DONE SO IN THE PAST HOWEVER UNDER THIS BILL. IT DOES NOT GRANT CALPERS THAT AUTHORITY TO WAIVE THAT PORTION IT IT DOES SAY THE EMPLOYER MUST PAY IT -- I THINK THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THAT. THIS PUTS THE ONUS -- 1100% ON THE EMPLOYER WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT IS IT IS IT -- YEAH I THINK THAT IS NEAR THE THE ULTIMATE QUESTION WE'VE WE HAD AN AGREEMENT THE THE EMPLOYERS CREATED THIS BENEFIT -- WENT TO CALPERS AS A AS A WAY TO TRY PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO AN EMPLOYEE -- THEY THEY BARGAIN TO THIS THEY SAT DOWN THE PARKING UNIT THEY CAME TO AGREEMENT THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO. BOTH THE BARGAINING UNIT AND THE EMPLOYER WERE WRONG AND WHAT THEY WHAT THEY AGREED TO INSTABILITY CALPERS AND THEY CAME TO AN UNLAWFUL AGREEMENT. IS IT A 100% THE EMPLOYERS FROM -- RESPONSIBILITY THAT POINT NOW. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT IT IS THE EMPLOYER'S RESPONSIBILITY AND I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A MISTAKE IS UNLAWFUL I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO GO WITH THIS THAT BECAUSE IT ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT YOU BARGAINED FOR THAT PARTICULAR EMPLOYEE. BECAUSE SOMEONE MADE A MISTAKE MY ISSUE IS AND THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS THE EMPLOYEE THE WORKER WHO PUT IN ALL THEIR TIME DID EVERYTHING THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO SHOULD NOT SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF SOMEONE ELSE'S MISTAKE. SO IS THERE A WAY I MEAN WE DON'T WANT THE MISTAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE -- SO IS THERE SOME WAY WE COULD -- TIGHTNESS OPTED TO PUT THE RESPONSIBILITY SHOULDN'T BE ON THE EMPLOYEE TO RUN AROUND TRYING TO GET THAT TO FIND AN ACTUARY WHO CAN DECIDE THIS I MEAN. EITHERCALPERS OR THE EMPLOYER IT SEEMED TO ME SHOULD BE THE ONES WHO ARE SORT OF GUARANTEEING THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION. SO MAYBE THE QUESTIONS WERE -- IS IT IS IT THE IT IS A CALPERS THAT THAT MESSED UP HERE IF YOU WILL OR IS THERE SOME WAY TO I MEAN I WISH THEY WERE HERE SO WE COULD GET COULD KIND OF PUT THEM IN THE HOT SEAT A LITTLE BIT IS THERE'S ARE YOU HERE. FROM CALIFORNIA I'M WITH THE LEAGUE IS IT IS JUST -- TO TO THE POINT THE POINT IS IS THAT WHEN WE SIT WHEN OUR UNIT BARGAINING UNITS IN THIS IN THE EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER IN MUTUALLY AGREED TO NAME A FEW THAT YOU SUBMIT THAT THAT CONTRACT YOU CALPERS FOR THEIR APPROVAL FOR RETIREMENT SERVICES ABOUT BENEFIT. SO DEMI DENTURE QUESTION UNITS WOULD BE ON THE AGENCY TO VERIFY. IF THOSE AT THAT THEY'VE WHAT HAS BEEN AGREED TO WAS LAWFUL. AND IS ACTUALLY -- DEFERRED COMPENSATION OR UNLOCK OR YEAH CAN WE DON'T USE LAWFUL OF TELL YOU WHY. REALLY DISTURBS ME -- IT IMPLIES THAT THE EMPLOYEE IS DOING SOMETHING UNLAWFUL EMPLOYEES TO ACCEPTING THE THE NUMBERS THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED TO THE EMPLOYEE FROM WHICH THEY WILL THEN. THE EITHER RECEIVER NOT RECEIVE A RETIREMENT BENEFIT I I DON'T KNOW UNLAWFUL IS I JUST THINK IT CAST. AN INAPPROPRIATE PAUL ON THE EMPLOYEE THE EMPLOYEE IS ACCEPTING WHATEVER IT IS THAT THE NUMBER IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AND AND IF SO WHO DO WE WHO SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY LAWFULLY OR UNLAWFULLY IS NOT THE ISSUE IT'S THE NUMBERS WRONG. THE THE THE AMOUNT IS ARGUABLY TOO MUCH BUT I WILL BET YOU THERE INSTANCES WHERE THE WHERE THE NUMBERS TOO LITTLE. HOW DO WE ASSURE THAT THE NUMBERS CORRECT THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE US GET TO SENATOR JACKSON I WOULD SAY? I THINK MISTAKES WILL ALWAYS BE MADE UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE CAN ALWAYS TIGHTEN THINGS UP I AM HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH CALPERS. AND FIND OUT HOW THIS HAPPENED WHAT NOT MAKE SURE THEIR FOLKS ARE TRAINED BUT I I AGREE I DON'T LIKE HEARING HAT IT'S UNLAWFUL BECAUSE IT AGAIN. IT IT CASTS A SHADOW ON THE EMPLOYEE WHO WAS NOTHING WRONG EXCEPT WORK AND DO WHAT THEY WERE TOLD TO DO. THEY WERE GIVEN THIS BENEFIT AND NOW THEY'RE NOT ENTITLED TO IT BECAUSE IT WAS MISCALCULATED OR NOT ENTITLED TO WHAT THEY WERE GIVEN SO I WILL SPEAK TO CALPERS AND SEE IF WE CAN DO THAT BUT I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU 1100%. THAT I'M SURE WELL PEOPLE BEEN OVERPAID PEOPLE BEEN UNDERPAID AND THE EMPLOYERS ARE RUNNING OUT AND SAYING TO THEM GOSH WE OWE YOU MORE MONEY. CANDIDLY THEY DON'T KNOW BUT STILL. A CONSIDER MAYBE JUST ONE MORE COMMENT -- TO CLOSE ON THAT CERTAINLY ISN'T THESE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE NOW. BUT FOR HIS ARRIVAL TO RULES THESE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYERS NOW THEY DON'T AVAIL COMES OF IT SO I THINK WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO. IS FLIP THE INCENTIVES. THANK YOU BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IF IT IS AGREED TO AN AMMO YOU. STERN DETERMINED LATER TO BE UNLAWFUL. SIMPLER GOES. CAUSING THE EMPLOYEE GETS THE LETTER THE RETIREES SO I THINK THIS IS JUST ABOUT. PUTTING THE RIGHT INCENTIVES IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THE PARTIES TO COME TO CALPERS AND AND CHECK OFF THEIR THEIR BARGAIN AND WILL USE TO MAKE SURE NO ONE GETS PUT IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE. WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR WELCOME I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WHILE I WAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND ASSEMBLY THAT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- I'D SAY HEARD OF A VERSION OF THIS BILL IS -- AND HERS -- LAST YEAR. AND I I HAVE TO AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID WHAT SIR JACKSON SAID IT SHOULD NOT FALL ON THE EMPLOYEE THIS IS THE THE EMPLOYEE ACTED THAT FAITH. AND FACT -- THE PARTICULAR CASE ALTHOUGH I THINK THIS BILL PLIES MORE BROADLY THAN ANY PARTICULAR CASE -- EVEN CHECKED -- AND SO PEOPLE MAKE PLANS STATE. AT SO IT'S BOTH HOW MUCH AGAIN RETIREMENT BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS NOT TO BE CLOSE NOT ONLY DO IT IF THAT WAS THE RESULT CLUB BACK THE MONEY IS ALSO THE LOWER THE OVERALL RETIREMENT RIGHT SO I MEAN DOES A DOUBLE HIT IT WAS NOT JUST. ONE HIT. AND AND SO WHEN THE VOICE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH -- THEN THEY SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE PENALIZED I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PART RIGHT SO. THE EMPLOYEE THROUGH THE BARGAINING UNIT HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR EMPLOYER AND THEIR CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OR PROMISES WERE MADE. RIGHT AND THEN THE EMPLOYER THE CITY COUNTY WHATEVER HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH HERS TO HANDLE THEIR RETIREMENT AND WHAT. WHAT FITS AND WHAT DOESN'T FIT IN THERE? AND SO I THINK THAT -- AND THE OTHER PART IS OF COURSE PERS AB AS AN ENTITY AND I KNOW THEY'RE NOT HERE -- BUT AND I'M NOT GO STRAIGHT SPEAK FOR THEM IN ANY WAY -- BUT CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THAT RETIREMENT FUND IS IS STABLE SO NOW WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO SPEND MONEY THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE. SO BUT I THINK THAT WHERE THIS NEEDS TO BE SETTLED IF THERE WAS AN ERROR BY. I WOULD SAY IS THAT OKAY WHO WHO GOT THE MONEY IN THE END RIGHT AND WHO GOT THE MONEY TO REINVEST OR WHATEVER ELSE AND HOW THAT MONEY GETS THE COUNTED -- FOR SO BUT IT SHOULDN'T CERTAINLY SHOULD FALL ON THE EMPLOYEE IT SHOULD BE SO THERE'S AN ISSUE. SINCE THE EMPLOYEE HAS RELATIONSHIP ON PLAYER MAKES SENSE FOR THE EMPLOYER TO SAY OKAY YOU KNOW I HAVE TO PAY OUT BUT IF EMPLOYER FEELS THAT PURRS ACT IN THE WAY THAT. THEY'RE LIKE WE PAID MONEY AND WE NEED TO GET SOME MONEY BACK TO FOR THAT CAN BE BETWEEN EMPLOYER IN PERSON THAT'S RIGHT. RIGHT BUT THOSE TWO OUT OF TO GET OUT -- BUT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THE EMPLOYEE CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES SO -- SO WITH THAT I CERTAINLY -- AND HAPPY TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT -- AND ACTUALLY -- IT HAS BEEN MOVED I WILL MOVE THE BILL AS WELL -- BUT THE I KNOW WILL HAVE TO VOTE ON A FEW THINGS BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY VOTE ON THIS. THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU THE MOVE WAS TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU BEFORE WE DO TAKE THAT MOTION I APPRECIATE THAT IF YOU'LL BEAR WITH THE SAYS CENTER LABOR FOR SECONDS WE ESTABLISH THE COMMITTEE RULES -- WE DO HAVE THE THE RULES AND NOT STATED IN THE RULES BUT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT MOVING FORWARD THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE FILE ITEM BORDER.

A CONCERN THAT I HAD AS WELL ABOUT THE THE REQUIREMENT AND THAT -- THE DISH PLACES ON CALPERS IN AND THAT ONE ASPECT OF YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS THE BILL'S DRAFTED. IT FILLS THE CORE MISSION THAT WERE LOOKING FOR BUT AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS -- IT HAD LIKE TO SEE THAT THAT REQUIREMENT. THAT PURRS REVIEWS ALL COMPENSATION PROPOSALS I MEAN I THINK THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR THEM -- EITHER YEAH THAT'D BE SHARPLY CURTAILED IN SOME WAY OR OR REMOVED ALTOGETHER I JUST I DON'T WANNA PLAY SHOULD MORE BURDENS ON THEM -- IF WE GET THE THE RESULTS THEY WERE LOOKING FOR IN THIS BILL WHICH I THINK IS THE GOAL AT THE END SO -- WITH THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM THE CENTER PANEL -- WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE.

BUT ON ON THE LAST DAY OF THE ABILITY -- TO TO ADDRESS BILLS ON SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH -- GOVERNOR BROWN TO VETO THE BILL BASED ON A FALSE PREMISE BUT ON A POLICY OPPOSED TO PENSION PLAN MODIFICATIONS. GOVERNOR BROWN WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PLAN AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED OR IN THIS BILL. WOULD RESULT IN RETROACTIVE CHANGES THAT WERE LARGE AMOUNT BUDGETED. HE WAS CORRECT ON ONE OF HIS THREE CONCERNS ONE IT WAS NOT RETROACTIVE. A COMPONENT OF THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE PENSION REFORM ACT PEPPER OF TWENTY THIRTEEN OF WHICH HE AND I ACTUALLY COLLABORATED ON THE RIGHT TRACK OF COMPONENTS SO I WOULD NOT. I WOULD NOT -- VIOLATE MY OWN POLICIES. TO A IT WAS NOT LARGE OUR OUR FIRST ACTUARIAL STUDY WAS LARGE WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROJECT. WHAT WOULD BE ABLE TO TO YOUR BILL LAST SESSION BUT AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW THE DEFERRAL COMPONENT OF THE BILL RESULTED IN AN UNFUNDED ACTUARIAL ACCRUED LIABILITY OF SOME TWENTY MILLION OVER TWENTY YERS WITH INTEREST IT WOULD BE ABOUT? TWO MILLION A YEAR BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- THIS WAS A VERY SMALL COST TO GAIN AN INCREDIBLE PERHAPS PRICELESS MORALE BOOST FROM THE MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN J. ARREST TO THAT ARE SERVING ON THE BENCH. BUT THREE HOWEVER HE WAS CORRECT IN THAT THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS NOT BUDGETED. TO MISTER CHAIR CONSEQUENTLY WE HAVE. SUCH A BUDGET REQUEST RUNNING CONCURRENTLY WITH THE PROGRESSION OF THIS BILL. AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WHO WILL RE ACQUAINT YOU WITH THE NEED FOR THE MINOR CHANGES TO THE CURRENT CLIFF VESTING FORMULA IN THE ORIGINAL TEAR ESTABLISHED. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER FLAWS HAVE APPEARED THAT NEED CORRECTING FLAWS THAT NO OTHER EMPLOYEE GROUPS. ARE SUBJECT TO IN THE STATE WHILE THE ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES IS THE SPONSOR YESTERDAY WE RECEIVED A LETTER. OF SUPPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION SO -- WE SEE THAT IS A VERY GOOD SIGN AND I'VE ALSO RECEIVED A LETTER. DATED TODAY BUT WITH FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN JUDGES THAT HAVE SUPPORTED -- THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL SO I'M DELIGHTED TO HAVE JUDGES ALISON LUIS ANY BOND CAMPUS TO TESTIFY THANK YOU HIS MERE [inaudible] A RUNNER. COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE TABLE -- I JUST WANT TO REMIND FOLKS OF WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS BILL FROM LAST CYCLE A AND THAT IS IT JUST SOFTENS THE BLOW OF ONE OF THE HARSHEST ELEMENTS OF THE CLIP FESTING. FOUR CHAIR RESTS TO IN THAT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE JUDGE THAT WOULD GET A DOLLAR MORE IN THEIR PENSION EIGHT DOLLARS EARLIER UNDER THIS BILL IT JUST ALLOWS THEM AFTER THEY HAVE THEIR TWENTY YEARS OF SERVICE. TO STEP OFF THE BENCH AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH AS A MEMBER OF THE BENCH WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AT AGE. FORTY FOUR I HAD THIS BILL IS PERSONAL TO ME BECAUSE I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAS TO SERVE TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN ORDER TO COLLECT A PENSION AT ALL. UNDER TERRORIST TO AND IF I SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH MY HEALTH I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THAT. WITHOUT HAVING ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS FOR THE PENSION OF FUNDING ITSELF WITH NO DOLLAR FOR ANYONE EARLIER -- AND NO DOLLAR MORE OF THAT WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU. FOR GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING I'M JUDGE OF ON CAMPUS FROM SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MUTUAL I'M A FORMER SENATE FELLOW FROM THE CLASS OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY NINE I SERVED.

MURDER SO IF YOU CAN SAY THAT THE RUN OF THE MILL RATE THIS THE RUN OF THE MILL CHILD MOLESTERS OF THE RUN OF THE MILL. SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMINALS ON A DAILY BASIS. HE ESTIMATES HE'S HANDLED OVER FORTY THOUSAND SENTENCES IF HE HAS TO SERVE. BETWEEN TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHICH IS WHAT IT WOULD HAVE TO DO UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION. HE ESTIMATES THAT AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE FORTY THOUSAND HOUSE FELONS WE'LL BE BACK OUT WILL DO SOMETHING AGAIN. AND HE RISKS LOSING HIS ENTIRE RETIREMENT AND OUT OF HIS FAMILIES -- SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS DOING ITS JOB OR DISPOSITION DEPARTMENTS ARE WORD 97% OF ALL OF OUR CASES ARE HANDLED LESS THAN 3% OF OUR CSES.

AND A FEATURE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE ILLEGAL UNDER ARREST THAT IN AND OF ITSELF. THE ISSUE OF CLIFF VESTING UNDER THE CHAIR AS TO SYSTEM IS ONE OF SEVERAL ISSUES WE SEE WITH THE SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION DID INTRODUCE A BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY AB. NINE SEVEN NINE THAT WILL ALSO SPEAK TO THE CLIFF VESTING ISSUE AS WELL AS SOME OTHER ISSUES AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SENATOR AND WITH THE PROPONENTS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND HOPEFULLY THAT BILL WILL MAKE IT TO YOUR COMMITTEE.

MOVING TO ITEM NUMBER EIGHT AS BEFORE SIXTEEN WELCOME THANK YOU NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN THIS MORNING. I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE MISUNDERSTANDING CONCERNING THE ORDER. WHEN I LIST HIS NAME HIS SIGNATURE LOOKS LIKE A CHICKEN SCRATCHING LOOKS? LIKE A DOCTOR'S SIGNATURE LEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE. ANYWAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. AS BEFORE -- SIXTEEN THIS IS -- A MEASURE. THAT WILL CREATE A A SYSTEM OF EQUITY AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WORKERS COMPENSATION A SOMETHING. EVERY WORKER SHOULD BE ENTITLED -- TO IMAGINE A COUNTRY -- THAT HAS A SYSTEM THAT JUST DEVELOPS INJURED WORKERS. AND AND ESPECIALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT WHERE ALMOST EVERY SINGLE AGENCY. IN OUR STATE IS HAVING A PROBLEM RECRUITING -- PEOPLE TO COME INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE -- VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE LOTS OF OF OF VACANCIES. THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT JOB LAW ENFORCEMENT'S VERY DIFFICULT VERY DANGEROUS -- WHEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE INJURED USUALLY THEY CANNOT CONTINUE TO PERFORM THEIR FUNCTIONS AND OFTEN TIMES -- WITH WITH -- THE THE MILLIONS THAT OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SPEND ON ON ON TRAINING THESE OFFICERS. ALL THAT IS LOST AND AND OFTEN TIMES -- YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING OUT. FOR FOR THE SPENDING IN A VERY SMALL COLUMN AND IGNORING SPENDING VERY LARGE COLUMNS SAYING WE'RE LOSING. A TRAINED PERSONNEL THAT COST US MILLION DOLLARS TO TRAIN OVER OVER ISSUES OF OF PAY AND AND AND AND BENEFITS. I'M IN THIS BILL. ATTEMPTS TO RECTIFY AN EQUITY IN THE SYSTEM THAT GIVES. A BENEFIT TO CERTAIN OFFICERS IN IT OUT IN THE FIELD AND AND NOT TO OTHERS. AND I THINK IT'S IT'S A THIS WASN'T NECESSARILY INTENTIONAL BUT IT WAS -- OF AN ISSUE RELATED TO CLASSIFICATION OF OF EMPLOYEES I THINK -- WE TODAY -- BECAUSE OF CUTS THAT AFFECTED HAVE AFFECTED GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS. BUT WE HAVE OFFICERS SO UNDER CERTAIN CLASSIFICATIONS ARE DOING WORK. IN AREAS THAT -- HAVE EXPANDED -- THAT HAVE FORCED HIM INTO -- MORE -- DANGEROUS EXPOSURE TO THEIR HEALTH SO. UNDER THE EXISTING LAW -- OFFICERS IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES -- OR GIVE IN -- SOME SHINS OR OFFERED -- TO DISPUTABLE PERCEPTIONS OF AN OCCUPATIONAL INJURY -- THESE -- PRESUMPTIONS INCLUDE -- THAT YOU KNOW IF IF THEY GET A HEART DISEASE HERNIAS PNEUMONIA CANCER MENINGITIS TUBERCULOSIS VIA CHEMICAL ILLNESS -- IT IS ASSUMED THAT IT WAS DONE UNDER THE OF COURSE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. AND THEY'RE TREATED FIRST AND QUESTIONS ARE ASKED LATER IF IT'S DETERMINED OR NOT THEY YOU KNOW ARE NOT -- COMPENSATED UNDER THE SYSTEM THAT THAT THE IS NOT AFFORDED TO EVERY -- LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL THIS BILL WOULD SEEK -- TO FOR PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL COVERAGE. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF OF HOW MANY PEOPLE BE COVERED UNDER THIS BILL. THERE ARE ABOUT EIGHTY SEVEN OVER EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND CLOSE TO EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND POLICE PEACE OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA. EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND ALMOST EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND ARE ARE COVERED UNDER. THE PRESUMPTIONS -- THE EXISTING CODES. ABOUT 6% OR JUST OVER FIVE THOUSAND ARE LEFT OUT. IT'S A SMALL NUMBER BUT IT'S AN AND A NUMBER THAT. RUNS THE RISK OF BASICALLY NOT ONLY LOSING THEIR THEIR JOBS BUT OF OF GOING BANKRUPT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT OFFERED. THIS BUT THIS PRESUMPTION. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO GET TREATMENT IMMEDIATELY UNDER OUR SYSTEM. SO THIS BILL WOULD CORRECT THAT INEQUITY WOULD GIVE -- THE THOSE -- REMAINING OFFICERS THE SAME PRESCRIPTIONS AND ALLOW THEM TO TO TO BE TREATED FAIRLY UNDER THE EXISTING LAW AGAIN -- I THINK ALL OF YOU UNDERSTAND -- THE THE THE DANGERS THAT ARE THAT ARE OUR POLICE OFFICERS -- ARE EXPOSED TO EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN THEY THEY THEY WAKE UP EVERY MORNING GO TO WORK -- THIS BILL BASICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL PEACE OFFICERS. YOU KNOW UP. SHOULD HAVE AN AT AND EQUITABLE SYSTEM OF CARE. AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT TODAY -- FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL [inaudible] YES. WHICH IS IN SUPPORT. MR REMEMBERS RAINY PERRY WITH ERIN REDUCE HAVE SINCE SOME HALF A PORAC. THIS THIS IS TRULY AN A AND AN INEQUITY AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY AND HOW AND HOW IT ACTUALLY BECAME -- CAME TO TO TO BE THIS WAY THE MANY OF WHAT WE CALL WITHIN PARK RECALL SPECIALIZED PEACE OFFICER G. OF AIRPORT PEACE OFFICER SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS TRANSIT OFFICERS. MANY OF THEM WERE NOT ESTABLISHED WHEN MOST OF THE TRIP WHEN -- PRESUMPTIONS WERE CREATED [inaudible] WHEN I? CHARTED -- LONG TIME AGO. THEY WERE REALLY IS IT WAS -- CITY AND COUNTY PEACE OFFICERS WERE AND HIVE TROLL REALLY ABOUT ALL YOU HAD. AND THEY WERE HANDLING ALL OF THOSE ISSUES OF SOMETHING HAPPENED A SCHOOL THAT ROLL ONS OF THE AIRPORT AND ROLE ON ON THEIR WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH FEDERAL EMPLOYEES FOR EXAMPLE TO RUN THE AIRPORTS -- IN THE LATE SEVENTIES AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE EIGHTIES. AGENCIES STARTED EITHER SPECIAL DISTRICTS OR BEGAN FOR EXAMPLE -- JUST TO SPEAK TO MISTER WEBB WHO'S HERE ALL USE HIM AS AN EXAMPLE STARTED -- DEVELOPING A CAMPUSES FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOL STARTED DEVELOPING POLICE OFFICERS ACTUAL POLICE OFFICERS THEY WERE CALLING HIM POLICE OFFICERS IN THE EIGHTIES BUT THERE REALLY SECURITY GUARDS THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE THIS TRAINING. THAT OFFICERS HAVE TODAY SO IF THERE IS A SEX CRIME HONOR ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS OR SOMETHING IN AND GOING ON A DRUG A MAJOR DRUG ISSUE OR SOMETHING GOING ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS. THEY WOULD CALL THESE PEOPLE CALL PLEASE BUT THEY WEREN'T THERE SECURITY GUARDS. AND SO THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND IN OUR OPINION WAS PUTTING PEOPLE IN DANGER. WHEN THEY HAD AN EXPECTATION OF A POLICE OFFICER ANYWHERE GET NOW SO? IN THE EIGHTIES WE REALLY STARTED LOOKING AT THESE AREAS INSANE STOP USING THESE WHAT YOU WERE CALLING POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT IN ALL THESE AREAS A RESUME ON TRANSIT DISTRICTS. AND WE STARTED THE LEGISLATURE STARTED SAYING NOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A POLICE OFFICER THEY NEED TO BE FULLY TRAINED POLICE OFFICERS AND THEY NEED TO BE CALL POLICE IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT NO DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR THAT. FOR THE BENEFITS. THE NEW SECURITY OFFICERS AND WILL CALL POLICE ON THE CAMPUS. IN THE PROBLEM IS AB THESE PEOPLE WERE THESE OFFICERS WERE CREATED AFTER A LOT OF THE AFTER A LOT OF THE PRESUMPTIONS WERE WRITTEN. SO -- WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO OVER THE YEARS AS WITH NEW PRESUMPTIONS EXPOSURES TO CHEMICALS AND ALIKE -- WE HAVE BEEN INCLUDING ALL PEACE OFFICERS BUT THEY ARE THERE A LOT OF THESE PEACE OFFICERS WHO BY THE WAY GO TO THE SAME ACADEMY IS AS ELLIE PD FOR EXAMPLE DOWNTURN. LA -- AT ALL THE SAME ACADEMIES FULLY TRAINED BUT A LOT OF THE SPECIALIZE OFFICERS HAVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING BUT A REGULAR A CITY OR OR MUNICIPALITY -- PEACE OFFICER WILL LIKE FOR EXAMPLE AND ALL THAT AGAIN ALL I MISSED WHAT TALK THE THEY HAVE TO BE TRAINED IN EDUCATION CODE ISSUES HOW. TO HOW TO DEAL AND WORK WITH STUDENTS -- I KNOW AIRPORT POLICE HAVE TO LEARN ALL THE FAA REGULATIONS AND HOW TO WORK ON ALL OF THE TERRORISM ISSUES ARE. THAT ON A REGULAR CITY OR COUNTY POLICE OFFICER DOESN'T HAVE. TO SO THERE'S ALWAYS THIS MISNOMER AND AND IT WAS IN A LETTER THAT I READ FROM THE OPPOSITION -- YOU KNOW THERE THEY CALL. REAL COPS ARE REAL PLEASE UPDATE REFERENCE TO AND IT WAS RIDICULOUS THEY'VE CLEARLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. ALL THIS BILL DOES IS SIMPLY SAYS THAT IF AN OFFICER IN ALL USE HERE POOR FOLKS YOU WERE IN AN EXPERT MAJOR EXPLOSION OF A OF AN AIRPLANE CRASH OR SOME. AND YOU ARE EXPOSED TO THE SAME CHEMICALS AS ALL THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS WERE ROLLING INTO THAT SYSTEM AND YOU GET CANCER OR WHATEVER THAT INJURY IS. THAT ALL THE OTHER PEACE OFFICERS GUY. YOU SHOULD HAVE THE SAME. BENEFIT AND THAT IS THE SHOULD HAVE THE SAME RIGHT TO A PRESUMPTION. GET TO WORK IMMEDIATELY SO YOU CAN GET RIGHT BACK TO WORK AND GET BACK ON THE JOB. AND THAT'S ALL THE BILL HOUSE. FOR THANK YOU MISTER PERRY GOOD MORNING THE FOOD. GOOD MORNING HAVE MONIES PJ WEB -- ON THE PRESIDENT THE LOS ANGELES SCHOOL POLICE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION AND I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE SPECIALIZED ASSOCIATIONS COALITION WITH PAUL RACK -- HERE TO SPEAK TO YOU IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- JUST WANT TO COVER A COUPLE OF THINGS -- THESE HEALTH CONDITIONS -- FOR WHICH THE CURRENT WORKERS COMP PRESUMPTIONS -- COVER FOR MOST OF THE FLEET PEACE OFFICERS IN THE STATE THEY EXIST BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS RECOGNIZE THAT PEACE OFFICERS ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK TO DEVELOP THESE CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREER. AND MANY OF THESE CONDITIONS THEY DON'T MANIFEST THEMSELVES IMMEDIATELY ON IN FACT MANY OF THEM MAY TAKE YEARS TO MANIFEST -- WITHOUT THESE PROTECTIONS FOR THESE PEACE OFFICERS -- AS IN PARTICULARLY THESE ONCE A TAKE AWHILE TO MANIFEST -- EMPLOYERS ROUTINELY DENY THESE CLAIMS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PEACE OFFICERS WORK FOR AGENCIES THAT AREN'T COVERED UNDER THE CURRENT PRESUMPTIONS -- WHAT THIS HAVE THIS CREATED A SCENARIO? WHERE THESE OFFICERS HAVE TO USE OF THEIR OWN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR TREATMENTS -- INCURRING ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL STRAIN WITH CO PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES THAT THEY HAVE THROUGH THEIR THEY HAVE TO USE THEIR OWN LEAVE TIME. WHEN I LEAVE TIME IS EXHAUSTED IF THEY'RE NOT BETTER THEY'RE SEPARATED FROM SERVICE? CAUSING FURTHER FINANCIAL STRAIN AND LOSE THEIR HEALTHCARE BENEFITS THEY'RE EMPLOYER COVERED HEALTH BENEFITS. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE FINANCIAL DISASTER FOR THE OFFICERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND IN MANY CASES IT'S COSTS THAN MY VERY LIFE -- QUESTION I I HAVE IS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE OF THE STATE DETERMINES IS TRAINING AND STANDARDS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER TO BECOME PEACE OFFICERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THE EXCLUDED GROUP OF THOSE OFFICERS FROM THE WORKERS COMP PROTECTION SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHO THEY WORK. FOR WHO EMPLOYEES -- THE EXCLUDED PEACE OFFICERS A TRAIN WORK THEY TRAIN AND THEY WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH ALL THESE OTHER PEACE OFFICERS WERE THE SAME EQUIPMENT. AND THEY'RE EXPOSED TO THE SAME HEALTH RISKS AS THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER AGENCIES. AND JUST AS AS AN EXAMPLE FOR OF THE CURRENT INEQUITIES AND I'LL USE MY AGENCY AS AN EXAMPLE -- ARE THERE MANY CITY AND COUNTY AGENCIES THAT -- PROVIDE FULL TIME SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS -- TO SCHOOLS THAT WORK IN SCHOOLS -- THE POLICE -- THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN POLICE DEPARTMENT. THOSE OFFICERS OF THE SORROWS. ARE PERFORMING THE IDENTICAL SAME DUTIES THAT OUR OFFICERS DO AND ALL SCHOOL PEACE OFFICERS IN THE STATE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE OFFICERS. AT AND THOSE OFFICERS ARE COVERED UNDER WORKER'S COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS AND IT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHO EMPLOYEES ARE. NOT THE JOB THEY'RE DOING -- THIS BILL EXPANDS COVERAGE ONLY TWO SWORN PEACE OFFICERS AS DEFINED IN THE PENAL CODE. IT'S NOT MAKING UP ANYTHING NEW -- IT'S IT'S THE COSTS THAT THE THAT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION ARE REFERRING -- TO AS A RESULT OF THE PASSAGES BILL ARE VERY LIKELY BE OFFSET. BY SAVINGS TO THEIR EMPLOYER PAID HEALTH BENEFITS. WHICH IS CASA DRIVE UP WITH THE USAGE THAT THAT IS NECESSARY TO TREAT SOME OF THESE CONDITIONS. THE RETENTION OF QUALITY EMPLOYEES. AND SAVINGS FROM EMPLOYEE IS RETURNING TO WORK EARLIER. BECAUSE THROUGH THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IN THE REFORMS A FEW YEARS AGO -- AN INDEPENDENT -- MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESS SO EXISTS AND IT'S THERE TO MONITOR THE WHOLE SITUATION TO MAKE SURE THESE EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK EARLIER. SAVING ADDITIONAL MONEY -- WE HAVE DATA -- A SIMILAR BILL -- WAS -- VETOED A FEW YEARS AGO BY GOVERNOR BROWN -- REQUESTING -- SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE -- TO SHOW THAT THESE CLASSES OF PEACE OFFICERS ARE EXPOSED TO THE SAME RISKS AS AS THE OFFICERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY COVERED -- UNIT WE WE HAVE TO STOP AND THINK WHAT OKAY WHAT. WOULD QUALIFY AS AS EVIDENCE EVIDENCE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY EXPOSED TO THESE RISKS WHAT I CAN THINK OF A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS REAL LIFE STORIES AND EXAMPLES. AND I COULD BE HERE ALL DAY PROVIDING THOSE AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU SOME IF IF THE CHAIR -- OR OR OR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN HEARING THOSE. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO -- DATA THAT'S COMPILED -- FROM ACTUAL WORKERS COMP CLAIMS THAT WERE FILED BY THESE PEACE OFFICERS WITH THEIRS EMPLOYERS. AND COMPARING WHAT WAS. WHAT WAS APPROVED WHAT WAS DENIED WHAT WAS APPEALED WAS ULTIMATELY RULED IN THEIR FAVOR? WELL. THE ISSUE WITH THAT WHICH IS THE WORST WHICH WE WE'VE RUN INTO DIFFICULTY WITH IS A LOT OF THESE EMPLOYERS REFUSED TO GIVE UP GIVE UP THAT INFORMATION -- THEY PUT UP OBSTACLES HOWEVER I WAS ABLE TO WITH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGER -- AGENCIES REPRESENTING SOME OF THESE OFFICERS THAT ARE COVERED TO OBTAIN THIRTEEN YEARS A WORKERS COMP DATA -- REGARDING SPECIFICALLY THESE CONDITIONS WILL BE COVERED UNDER THIS BILL. I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU. TO REVENUE IF YOU WOULD PLEASE I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS REGARDING THOSE REGARDING THAT DATA AND AND I DO URGE YOUR SUPPORT A PROJECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITH DECISION SUPPORT PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE AND STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION.

EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM OR PROBATION OFFICERS AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEE NO -- ONE IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORTH [inaudible] PLEASE [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. CALIFORNIA'S INSTITUTION JOINT POWERS IT OR IF YOU NEED. TO YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT FOR THOSE OF YOU NEW TO THE COMMITTEE MOST PUBLIC ENTITY IS A SELF INSURED THROUGH THE MECHANISM OF A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO FORM A NONPROFIT PUBLIC ENTITY. A CORPORATION -- EXCEEDING ORGANIZATION FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS IT IS OUR GOAL IS PUBLIC EMPLOYERS TO HELP OUR INJURED EMPLOYEES RECEIVE APPROPRIATE MEDICAL TREATMENT AND TO RECOVER FROM THEIR ILLNESSES AND RETURNED TO WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWS THAT THE SOONER AN INJURED WORKERS ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE BETTER. MEDICAL OUTCOMES AND THERE SHOULD BE A BROAD CONVERSATION ABOUT THE PRESUMPTION ELIGIBILITY THAT EXAMINES THE COST AN IMPACT TO INJURED WORKERS SUCH AS THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN SB. FOUR SIXTEEN AND AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH CONVERSATIONS. IT'S BEEN IMPLIED THAT WITHOUT PRESUMPTIONS THE ONLY RESORT PERSONAL HEALTH INSURANCE AND PERSONAL TIME OFF OF WORK AND NOT FAR FROM THE TRUTH. ANY INJURED WORKER CAN MAKE A WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIM AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ILLNESS OR INJURY HAPPENED AT WORK AND THAT IT AUTOMATICALLY COVERED IF IT HAPPENED IT WORK REGARDLESS OF FAULT OR THAT IT WAS CUSED BY WORK. CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO FAVOR WORKERS WHO ARE CLEANING INJURY OR ILLNESS IS WORK RELATED. IF THERE'S A DISPUTE ABOUT AN INJURY ARISING OUT OF THE COURSE OR SCOPE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. LAW JUDGE WITH THE WORKERS COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD IS REQUIRED TO FOLLOW LABOR CODE FOR THIRTY TWO OH TWO WHICH REQUIRES THAT STATUTES SHALL BE LIBERALLY CONSTRUED BY THE COURTS WITH THE PURPOSE OF EXTENDING THEIR BENEFITS FOR THE PROTECTION OF PERSONS INJURED. IN THE COURSE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. TO ASSUME THAT WORK AT VARIOUS SITES COVERED BY THIS BILL IS SOLELY AND EFFECTIVELY UNDISPUTED WE THE CAUSE OF CANCER AND OTHER SERIOUS INJURIES. IS NOT SUBJECTIVE OR SUPPORTED BY MEDICAL EVIDENCE OR ANALYSIS. OUR MEMBERS HAVE REPORTED THAT CURRENTLY OPEN CLAIMS FOR THREE INDEPENDENT CANCER CASES ARE RESULTING IN SAVINGS THAT HAVE TO BE SET ASIDE OF THREE POINT NINE MILLION. THREE POINT ONE MILLION AND TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS EACH THESE ARE NOT SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY ASKED TO BE SET ASIDE BY A PUBLIC ENTITY IS. PRESUMPTION SHOULD BE USED BUT RARELY AND WHEN JUSTIFIED BY APPROPRIATE MEDICAL EVIDENCE. SAID NOT PROVIDED US WITH CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE TO A CHOIR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER FUNDING AS ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. FOR THESE REASONS WE REMAIN RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO REMIND. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MURS JASON SMELTER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION AND SEE SACK ACCESS INSURANCE AUTHORITY. FIRST ONE SAY WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A GREAT DEGREE OF RESPECT FOR ALL OF THE OFFICERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE UNDERSTAND FOR THESE BILLS ARE BEING BROUGHT FORWARD -- WITH GOOD INTENT. WE HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS OVER PUBLIC POLICY RELATIVE TO PRESUMPTIONS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE A GOOD IDEA I THINK FAITH IN A VERY GOOD JOB OF LAYING OUT. INTO THE ARGUMENT AROUND THE LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION CLAUSE -- IN AND THE LABOR CODEAND THE NO FAULT SYSTEM. A FEW COMMENTS BASED ON WHAT WAS SAID EARLIER. IT WAS IT WAS MENTIONED THAT EMPLOYERS ARE WITHHOLDING DATA -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT DATA THE SAYS I'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION I THINK OUR RESPONSE TO ALL OF THESE PRESUMPTION BILLS OVER THE YEARS HAS BEEN. LET'S SIT DOWN AND STUDY THIS LET'S LOOK LOOK AT THE TYPES OF INJURIES THE RATES OF DENIAL WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY DEVELOP AN OBJECTIVE BASIS FOR MOVING FORWARD. THE INEQUITY THAT'S NOTED IN THE SYSTEM IN LARGE DEGREE IS POLITICAL AND I'M JUST GONNA GO AND SAY THAT OUT LOUD IT IS BANNED WHAT CAN WE GET THROUGH. IN WHAT PERIODS OF TIME ON WHAT BILLS WITHOUT GETTING THEM HELD IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE OR SOME OTHER THING. IT'S BEEN A CHOICE ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY IT'S NOT NECESSARILY AND AND AND IN EQUITY OKAY -- THERE'S BEEN CHOICES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AROUND THESE AROUND THESE BILLS -- IT WAS ALSO SAID THAT THEIR ROUTINE TO NILES -- I AM PERSONALLY NOT AWARE OF THIS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO REVIEW ANY DATA THE COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION DOES A COMPENDIUM OF DATA AND THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM THAT'S TWO THREE FOUR HUNDRED PAGES THICK. EVERY YEAR THAT CUTS AND SLICES EVERY BIT OF DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE -- WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR PRESUMPTIONS WE DON'T BELIEVE THESE CLAIMS ARE BEING DENIED AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM IN THE SYSTEM IN THERE FOR FOR NOW WE JUROR NO VOTE BUT AGAIN IF THERE'S A CONVERSATION TO BE HAD AROUND DATA AND ANALYSIS -- WE'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME. FOR THE MORNING MANUALLY ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS ASSOCIATION AND IF OPPOSITION THANK USUALLY OTHERS. IN OPPOSITION. JOSH DUGGAR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO IN OPPOSITION AND ON BEHALF OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE URBAN I COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO ONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AS SENATOR JEFF YES THANK YOU -- I'M. WONDERING WE HAD A WHOLE LOT OF PROBATION DEPARTMENT FOLKS COME UP AND I DIDN'T SEE IN THE ANALYSIS. SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE DEFINITION OF PEACE OFFICERS IS IT. IS IT ACCURATE THAT THIS BILL WILL NOW EXPAND THAT DEFINITION TO INCLUDE PROBATION OFFICERS WHO WARD PREVIOUSLY. COVERED BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITION THAT YOU INDICATED OR YOU KNOW WHAT IN. IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INTERJECTION WE THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT AND I WAS GOING TO RAISE THAT AT THE END TO IT BECAUSE I THINK. IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT. SUPPORTING OUR OUR PEACE OFFICERS IN THE WORK THAT THEY DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE SOME DEFINITION OF WHAT EXACTLY THAT IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL THAT THAT IS MY CONCERN I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT I'M ASSUMING BECAUSE WE SAW. A LOT OF PROBATION OFFICERS AND CAN RESPOND TO THAT. I'M HAPPY TO LET ME FINISH THE QUESTION -- BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I DIDN'T KNOW TO WHAT DEFINITION THERE IS A PEACE OFFICER AND SO THAT. IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED BUT IF -- IF INDEED. THIS NOW WILL INCLUDE PROBATION OFFICERS WHO WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED I I'D APPRECIATE THAT. THAT INFORMATION. MEASUREMENT. AGAIN RANDY PERRY WITH POOR ACT -- I'D LIKE FIREFIGHTERS WHERE IF YOU'RE DISTRICT OR CITY FIREFIGHTER COUNTY SCHOOLS CAL FIRE STATE. FIREFIGHTERS FIREFIGHTER YEAR MISTRESSES FIREFIGHTER AND PRESUMPTIONS IN YOUR COVERED. WITH PEACE OFFICERS YOU GET TO GO TO CHAPTER FOUR POINT FIVE OF THE PENAL CODE COMMITTEE WAS SECTION EIGHT THIRTY AT SEC I'M. AND THAT DEFINES EVERY CATEGORY OF PEACE OFFICER FOR EXAMPLE EIGHT THIRTY POINT. ONE IS A CITY MUNICIPAL A PEACE OFFICER AND A COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFF. BUT I DID ASK MY STAFF TO GO PULL THAT FOR ME SO BUT CUTTING THROUGH THE CHASE -- A TO THE CHASE HERE -- OUR PROBATION OFFICERS CURRENTLY NOT INCLUDED AND SO THIS BILL WILL EXPAND TO INCLUDE PROBATION OFFICERS. SO THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES. HOW MANY PROBATION OFFICERS ARE THERE WHO WILL NOW BE INCLUDED -- WHO WERE NOT CURRENTLY CORRECT -- COVERED UNDER THE CURRENT DEFINITION PIECE OFF HERE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS THE THE THE NUMBERS THAT I CITED -- INCLUDE -- ALL CATEGORIES AFFECTED BY THIS BILL -- THAT NUMBER IS PRECISELY CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW THAT NUMBERS FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN SO OFFICER IT WILL COVER WHAT ABOUT OF THAT FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND OR PROBATION OFFICERS OR I'M JUST. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ARE THERE HERE HI I THINK WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS IT BECAUSE WHAT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I'M NOT SAYING RIGHTLY WRONG I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF THIS. IS ADD PROBATION OFFICERS TO PEACE OFFICERS WHO WILL BE COVERED UNDER THE PRESUMPTION OF HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY A SO ASSUMED. TO BE -- AS A RESULT OF WORK RELATED INJURY. FOR BOB YOU KNOW POLICE POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHERS AND NOW WE'RE ADDING PROBATION INTO THAT SAID AMANDA COURSE POLICE OFFICERS AND SCHOOL POLICE. SAID THEY'RE NOT AS MANY I ASSUME AS I'M JUST LOOKING FOR NOMINATIONS THE LARGEST NUMBER KICKS FROM PROBABLY OF AT LEAST HALF OF THAT NUMBER. I WAS HE PROBABLY OVER TEN IS THERE ANYTHING THAT -- CAN I KNOW SOME PROBATION OFFICERS. ARE THERE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO CARRY FIREARMS BECAUSE IT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS JOB I APPRECIATE THAT BUT IS THERE ANY DATA. CHOOSE ME THAT SHOWS THAT FOR THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION THAT THAT THERE IS A GREATER PROPENSITY FOR SOME OF THESE HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED -- THAT ARE PART OF THIS BILL AT CREATING THAT PRESUMPTION OF OF JOB RELATED INJURIES. POOR CONDITION HEART DISEASE -- SHE GOT. ANOTHER -- I KNOW THE DATA THE HERNIA. MONIA. AND ENJOY IT IS BY A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE EXPOSURE. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT INDICATES THAT THEY ARE AS LIKELY TO BE EXPOSED TO THIS AS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY COVERED. YES MA'AM. THANK YOU -- THE DATA THAT I WAS OBTAINED SAID THIRTEEN YEARS OF DATA -- INDICATES THAT -- OF ALL OF THE PRESUMPTIONS THEY CAN'T THE OF THE THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE COVERED UNDER THE PRESUMPTIONS OVER THAT THIRTEEN YEAR PERIOD -- IN IN. THE LA -- THE SCHOOL POLICE ARENA -- FOUR SWORN -- THE NUMBERS ARE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR OUT F A POOL OF A ABOUT FORTY NINE HUNDRED OR A LITTLE OVER -- FOUR THOUSAND OVER THAT SIXTEEN YEAR PERIOD OF FILED CLAIMS. PROBATION OFFICERS ALL I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HEAR YOUR QUESTION SPECIFIC. LOOKING IT'S NOT WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION ON PROBATION -- HE HE PULLED UP FOR HIS ORGANIZATION AND AND IT HAS LIKE. A I WOULD ASK THEM. IF THEY HAD THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION. BUT TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT YOU SEE SOME OF THEM CARRY FIREARMS -- BUT HOWEVER THEY DO ROLL OUT WITH THE PEACE OFFICERS WHENEVER THEY'RE GOING TO HOUSE LIKE THEY'RE ALWAYS IN ON THE HEADSET HAVE FELT I I GUESS I'M SHOWS OFF. I DON'T HAVE THEM YEAH I'M A BIG SUPPORTER PREVENT I THINK WE NEED TO BE GIVING PROBATION MORE -- RISE FONTS ABILITIES BUT I'M JUST WONDERING -- IS THERE ANY DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A HIGHER PROPENSITY FOR PROBATION OFFICERS DEVELOPING THESE CONDITIONS AS A AS A RESULT OF THEIR WORK EXPERIENCE -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SCIENTIFIC DATA SOME SOME INFORMATION THAT. IDENTIFIES THE THEIR THEIR EXPERIENCE IS LIKELY TO CAUSE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS A PRESUMPTION. BASED UPON ONE'S WORK -- EXPERIENCE I'M JUST ASKING. WE SHOULD ASSN YET YES WE WE HAVE TRIED AND AT THIS POINT WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING THAT -- THROUGH THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT OF THE THEIR THEIR EMPLOYERS -- WE KNOW ANECDOTALLY THE PERCENTAGE OF DENIED CLAIMS IS VERY MUCH THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND CONSISTENT -- WHICH IS ABOUT 15% OF THE CLAIMS FILED ARE DENIED -- GENERALLY THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THAT I WOULD SPOKE TO THAT ARE ROUTINELY DENIED BECAUSE THEY TOOK A PERIOD OF TIME TO MANIFEST THEMSELVES. SO WE CAN PASS THAT DAD AND SEE IF THEY CAN PUT IT TOGETHER. YEAH SURE. MY THANK YOU SENATOR CASH OTHER OTHER QUESTIONS OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- I MEAN THAT THE THAT WAS OF CONCERN THAT THE THAT I HAD AS WELL WAS THE LACK OF ITS DEFINITION AND SPECIFICITY RELATED. TO THE WHO NOW IS CONSIDERED A PEACE OFFICER IS DEFINED BY THE THE BILL I MISS YOUR FIVE CHESS I MEAN MICHAEL IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION WHY ARE WE DOES REQUIRE WE INCLUDING THEM. I MEAN IS THERE ANYTHING TO TO SHOW THAT THEY SHOULD BE INCLUDED BECAUSE EITHER THEY'RE BEING DENIED CLAIMS. THAT A AND THEY HAVE. A YOU KNOW PERCENTAGE WISE THE SIMILAR SIMILAR. WORK EXPERIENCE AND EXPOSURE TO THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY COVERED I JUST. CAN A Y. E.. WHY NOT BE YOU KNOW? WHY IT WHY THEM I I WAS GOING TO SOME SILLY ANALOGY BUT IT'S NOT SILLY I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT? WHERE WE CAN KIND OF? PUT OUR ARMS AROUND THE FACT THAT THEY ARE INDEED AT RISK BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK. WE CAN DERIVE HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE AFFECTED. BY THIS BILL JUST BASED ON THE DEFINITION OF HOW THOSE POSITIONS ARE DEFINED AND WE KNOW THAT THAT WILL COME OUT TO ABOUT. FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN POSITIONS. THE AND WE ALSO DEFINE WHAT THOSE -- HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE AT THAT ARE COVERED UNDER THE PRESUMPTION AND THEY'RE LISTED AS WELL THE VERY SPECIFIC HEART DISEASE AND IN OUR HERNIAS PNEUMONIA CANCER MENINGITIS TUBERCULOSIS. BIOCHEMICAL ILLNESS AND AND WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT I MEAN WHO OUT THERE -- IS EXPOSED TO BIOCHEMICAL ILLNESS SO NOT JUST ON A ON A NO THEY GO HOME AND THEY'RE EXPOSED TO THE BUCK IN THE LOCAL ILLNESS. THAT THAT SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY. THE FOR SOMEBODY LIMóN A NORMAL LIFE UNLESS STATE THEIR HOBBY IS TO WORK WITH. BIO CHEMICALS AFTER AFTER HOURS AND THAT COULD PROBABLY BE A CASE OF BEING MADE AGAINST THEM BUT WE DO HAVE CURRENTLY OFFICERS IN THESE POSITIONS THAT GO OUT THERE AND THEY ARE EXPOSED. TO A BIO CHEMICAL WASTE OFTEN IF THEY'RE IN IN A SETTING. WHERE THEY HAVE -- TO INVESTIGATE -- CERTAIN -- CERTAIN CRIMES OR ARE WORKING IN AREAS WHERE THERE THESE CHEMICALS ARE. REGULARLY -- LOCATED. BUT YOU KNOW THESE ARE VERY STRESSFUL JOBS I DON'T KNOW QUESTION VERY STRESSFUL JOBS AND THE STRESS ITSELF OFTENTIMES BEING EXPOSED TO VERY HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS. IS A VERY. COMMON CONTRIBUTOR OF HEART DISEASE AND AND AND SOME OF THESE ILLNESSES AS WELL. AND SO -- JUST BECAUSE YOUR PROBATION OFFICER OR A SCHOOL POLICE OFFICER DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT EXPOSED TO SAYS. STRESSFUL SETTINGS ON A DAILY BASIS I THINK THOSE JOBS WE CAN ALL AGREE ARE. ARE ARE VERY STRESSFUL JOBS THE VERY DIFFICULT JOBS AND OFTEN IN AROUND -- INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS THAT AT THAT HAVE -- CERTAIN. BOB ELEMENTS IT WITHIN WITHIN THEMSELVES AND EXPOSE. THESE -- OFFICERS TO THESE SPECIFIC ILLNESSES WELL WE HAVE KIND OF NARROWED IT. TO TO THESE AREAS THAT ARE. UP AREAS THAT. AFFECT OF THE POLICE PERSONNEL A LITTLE BIT MORE MORE OFTEN THAN THE PUBLIC IN A AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN TERMS OF PROVIDING SPECIFIC. DATA I THINK. WE HAVE WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO COMPILE THAT. THAT COVERS THE THE THE FULL COHORT. AND AN INDIVIDUALLY I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN BREAK THAT DOWN BUT WILL DEFINITELY TRY. HERE SO IF I MAY UM OF HIS FUTURE YOU KNOW WE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT JUDGES RETIREMENT. AND THE TESTIMONY ABOUT ONE JUDGE IS PROBABLY SINCE FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE I SUSPECT THAT'S PRETTY STRESSFUL BUT DO WE MAKE THE SAME PRESUMPTION FOR JUDGES AND THE ANSWERS I DON'T THINK WE DO. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY WE ARE CREATING THAT DISTINCTION SO I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL NOW BUT I WOULD LIKE TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE THAT. THERE IS IF YOU KNOW DATA THAT WILL CONFIRM THE INCLUSION OF THIS GROUP IS APPROPRIATE THAT'S ALL -- IS AN INTERJECTION IT'S ACTUALLY. I AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK -- IT'S IT'S A Y. H.. ACTION TO TO TO TAKE IN WHAT WITH THIS BILL DOES GO TO APPROPRIATIONS AND AND I SHOULD ON SO IF WE COULD. GET THAT DATA IT BEFORE IT GETS TO APPROPRIATIONS OUT OR AT APPROPRIATIONS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND THEN IT DOES COME TO THE FLOOR FOR TO GET OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS WILL LOOK AT SENATOR. JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP THE LIST OF CONDITIONS ARE THOSE THE CONDITIONS. FOR THE EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR THE PEACE OFFICERS HOOTERS PRESUMPTION OURS THEIR SPECIFIED. OKAY SO THERE WASN'T SOME ANALYSIS OF CLAIMS TO SAY THAT. THE NEW POPULATION THAT WE'RE ADDING ON AND REALIZING THEY'RE ACTUALLY A DIVERSE GROUP TO I MEAN THEY'RE NOT ALL. YES -- WOULD. TO HAVE THE EXACT SAME EXPOSURES BUT THERE LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. TO IN THE EXACT SAME JOBS. YOUR CORRECT FOR EXAMPLE AIRPORT. OFFICERS ARE GENERALLY MORE MORE EXPOSED MORE. TO TALK SENSE AND AND YOU KNOW RITE AID CHEMICAL CHEMICAL EXPOSURE OKAY SO HE'S GOOD AT ANY AYE. NOT CERTAIN WHAT SUPPORT THE BILL AND THEY'LL DO SO DAVE I THINK IT'S HELPFUL I THINK IT'S AN EXACT SAID GET SOME MORE. DATA -- I HEARD ABOUT FIREFIGHTERS AND YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S AND ONE NOW WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT. WELL MAYBE THEY'LL CHEMICAL PLANT FIRES DIFFERENT A WILDFIRE BUT SO THERE MAY BE MORE SUPPLIES I THINK THERE'S ACTUALLY MAYBE SOME MORE. NO ONCE TO DEPENDING ON WHICH ENVIRONMENT YOU ARE WORKING IN AT THE MOMENT -- YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY WANT RECOGNIZE THE ONES THAT ARE INHERENT TO THE JOB -- WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE YOU KNOW I TELL ME TALK ABOUT WORKERS COMP. LABOR COMMITTEE TALKS WITH THE ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT WITH THE WORKERS COMP. THAT AND WE WILL TRY TO BE SURE FIRST OF ALL OF COURSE THE WORKERS GET COMPENSATION A NEED FOR MANY WORKPLACE L. INJURY OKAY THAT'S NUMBER ONE BUT WE ALS RECOGNIZE THERE'S A COST AT THE OTHER END OF THAT SO. WELL CERTAINLY THE THE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TO GET THE CARE TO GET THEM BACK TO WORK HOPEFULLY. THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO KEEP SOME MIND ON THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL -- THE SURE THAT -- AT AND AND SO I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME MORE DATA AND I DON'T KNOW WAS OR AT ANY OF OUR AGENCIES HAVE SOME MORE DATA I REALIZE AND IT'S HARD TO GET FROM THE PLAYER BUT WHETHER THERE'S AN ON TERMS OF CLAIMS ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS. THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO GIVE SOME GUIDANCE. THANK YOU REPENT. FOR THE CALL FOR THE QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE -- THERE A MOTION MOTION FROM US SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND JUST YOU KNOW JUST GENERALLY I THINK JOBS ARE ALL ALL EMPLOYMENT STRESSFUL BUT VERY FEW INVOLVE -- A THREAT TO YOUR LIFE ON A DAILY BASIS AND THAT THAT. THAT I THINK BRINGS YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL STRESSES TO TO A PERSON -- DOING ITS JOB -- FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD -- YOU KNOW I I THINK GENERALLY. I THINK OF US VERY STRONG ARGUMENT HAS BEEN MADE THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE THE HOLES SYSTEM OF HOW WE HANDLE OFFICERS IT IN? IN IN -- IN CALIFORNIA I THINK -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE HAVING AN EQUITY. EXIST IN THIS SYSTEMS THAT APPLIES TO SOME OFFICERS. FOR MAYBE WHATEVER REASON OF MISS PERRY SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS. OF OR OR ALLUDED TO HIS EXPERIENCE THAT IT WAS -- CAME OUT ITS FUNCTION OF OF NEW -- OR OLD POSITIONS GIVEN THE NEW DUTIES. NEW POLICE OFFICER POWERS THAT DIDN'T EXIST -- THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME WHY WHY WOULD BE INCLUDED -- IS IS. THERE THERE IS NO ROOM REALLY GOOD ARGUMENT WHY WHY THAT. THAT WAS DONE. I THINK -- WE NEED TO CORRECT THAT -- THERE BE BE THERE WILL BE A COST BUT IT'S CUT COSTS WITHIN A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE ARE PAID INTO PEOPLE ARE PAYING. WORKERS COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS FROM THEIR CHECKS -- THERE WILL BE AS AS AS MENTIONED HERE IN THE PRESENTATION SAVINGS IN OTHER AREAS. THAT ARE COVERED BUT I THINK THIS. I THINK THE COST WILL WILL BALANCE OUT. OVERALL IN THE SYSTEM THE MOST IMPORTANT PART I THINK. THAT THAT WE NEED -- TO MENTION SAID THIS DOESN'T COME AT A COST TO THE OFFICERS WERE YOU BASICALLY PUT THEM OUT IN THE STREET. WHERE WE'VE WOULD CREATE INDIVIDUALS THAT GO INTO? BANKRUPTCY OR FINANCIAL DISTRESS DISTRESS OR LOSE THEIR HOMES OR FOR WHATEVER REASON THE SYSTEM CREATES -- THE CAUSE OF AN EQUITY THESE OFFICERS ARE ARE ARE ARE DEALING WITH FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. IN A SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY CAN. CAN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER FOR A FOUR TO PAY. FOR FOR FOR THEIR CARE. AND AND HOPEFULLY THEY ARE CARED FOR IN A WAY THAT RETURNS AND BACK TO THE JOB BECAUSE MOST OFTEN OR NOT THESE WILL BE. THE MOST EXPERIENCED -- OFFICERS OF OF THE POPULATION GRAYSON BASICALLY BE BEING TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE. AND THAT IN ITSELF HAS A COST BUT I THINK WE NEED TO EVALUATE THIS LEGISLATURE'S WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO. THIS -- DESERVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR MITCHELL TO DO PASSED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF PROBATION AND THEN A FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF EACH OFFICER WOULD BE GRATEFUL THANK YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. STUNT SENATOR HILL HI HILL I'M RURAL. RURAL NO JACKSON. JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE PAN [inaudible] HI. FOUR FOUR VOTES THE BILL IS A THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATE HUESO [inaudible] GENERAL. I AM I DON'T SEE SENATOR WIENER IS OUR ONLY OTHER [inaudible] CENTERS. MOVING TO ITEM SEVEN SP THREE FORTY ONE SENATOR MORALE. THANK YOU GUYS VICE CHAIR MARYLAND THING RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SENATE BILL THREE FORTY ONE ONE IMPROVE STATE FUNDING PENSIONS. AND LABOR PRACTICES IN OUR OUR STATE BY PAYING DOWN LIABILITIES. INCREASING TRANSPARENCY IN -- PROVIDING THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE -- IN HOLDING THE STATE THE SAME LABOR PRACTICES IMPOSED ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR. CURRENTLY OUR STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT PROGRAM IS FACING. MORE THAN A HUNDRED BILLION AND FUN LIABILITIES WHICH I THINK WE ALL KNOW -- THIS BILL WILL CAPITALIZE ARE ROBUST SURPLUS INAPPROPRIATE TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY DOWN CAL STIRS LIABILITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I INTRODUCED SB SIX OH ONE TO PROVIDE LEGISLATORS. AND THE PUBLIC WITH THE REAL PICTURE OF WHAT LIABILITIES -- FOR ARE FOR CALPERS CAL STIRS IN INDIA YOU SEE RETIREMENT PLAN. BY USING A RISK FREE -- DISCOUNT RATE EACH SYSTEM WILL HAVE TO SHOW TAXPAYERS AND THEIR MEMBERS THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL LIABILITIES THAT EACH SYSTEM PASSED. AS AN EXAMPLE CALPERS USES -- A RATE RIGHT NOW 7% DISCOUNT RATE TO REPORT THEIR UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE BILLION. HAVE COMPARED TO A MORE REALISTIC DISCOUNT RATE AT APPROXIMATELY 3% -- THE LIABILITY WHICH IS WOULD BE OVER ONE TRILLION WHICH IS VERY ALARMING -- THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIX THAT -- SPECIFIC PARAMETERS ON WHAT DISCOUNT RATE -- CORPORATIONS CAN USE TO REPORT THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN LIABILITIES SO THEY MUST REPORT ON DISCOUNT RATE OF SET BY THE US TREASURY AND I THINK THAT. POINT SEVEN TODAY. PERHAPS THE RATE -- SHOULD FOLLOW THE STANDARDS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PUT IN PLACE. AS A PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS THROUGHOUT -- AMERICA AND IN CALIFORNIA SB THREE FORTY ONE WILL CHANGE THE CAL SAVERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR PRIVATE EMPLOYEES -- FROM AN AUTOMATIC IN ROMAN TO AN ACTIVE OP IN PLANT BY CREATING OFTEN WE CAN ASSURE THAT WORKERS AREN'T PUTTING 8% OF THEIR PAY INTO A PROGRAM BY MISTAKE. THIS WOULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT EXPECTED. SB THREE FORTY ONE PROVIDES THE FREEDOM. BY ENSURING INDIVIDUALS WILL NOT BE FORCED INTO RETIREMENT PLAN THEY DO NOT WANT. IT WILL ALLOW POLICE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS LASTLY THIS BILL PROMOTES FAIRNESS BY REQUIRING. THAT THE STATE PLAY BY THE SAME RULES THAT MANDATES FOR PRIVATE EMPLOYERS. CALIFORNIA EXEMPTS ITSELF FROM LABOR CODES IN ONLY PAYS WORKERS ONCE PER MONTH A STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FOUND EMPLOYEES. REFERRED TO P. PAID ON MORE OFTEN. MANY WORKERS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BUDGET WITH A SINGLE PAYCHECK FOR THE MONTHS OF SWITCHING TO A SEMI MONTHLY. PAY SCHEDULE ACTUALLY INCREASES THE THE TAKE HOME PAY FOR EMPLOYEES A SENSE LESS IS BEING WITHHELD FROM THEIR CHECKS FOR TAXES. CALIFORNIA REGULARLY RANKS AS WE KNOW FIFTIETH AS MOST DIFFICULT STATE TO DO BUSINESS IN. THE TO THE VAST RULES AND REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON A PRIVATE SECTOR WITH THESE CHANGES -- MAYBE CALIFORNIA WILL BE LESS INCLINED TO IMPOSE -- BUSINESS -- HAMPERING RELATIONS -- REGULATIONS AND LAWS I THANK YOU CAN RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL AND JUST BE THREE FORTY ONE THANK YOU SENATOR MORALE -- OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. PLEASE COME FORWARD -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORTH. OKAY WE DO HAVE. IT PLEASE. IF THE COUPLE WITNESSES. TO GET INTO SOME DETAIL IF YOU LIKE AND THEN -- COULD HAVE JUST THE ME TO USE AFTER PLEASE CERTAINLY -- MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS TERRY BRENNAN ON BEHALF OF S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA -- I'LL BE BRIEF -- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR ANALYSIS IT'S VERY COMPLETE DETAILED. AND RECOGNIZES THAT THIS BILL IS A COMPILATION OF AT LEAST THREE OTHER BILLS. THAT FAILED IN THIS WELL THE PRIOR VERSIONS OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE PURSE COMMITTEE. IN PRIOR YEARS AND I WOULD SAY FOR GOOD REASON -- AND COMPILING THEM A RECAPITULATION I THINK THE ANALYSIS SAYS IN THE ONE BILL DOES NOT MAKE THEM A BETTER IDEA. AND FOR THE SAME REASONS IT WAS REJECTED BEFORE WE'D LIKE TO URGE YOUR NO VOTE AND REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON KATIE SALEN SKI I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA SECURE CHOICE RETIREMENT SAVINGS INVESTMENT BOARD. WHICH OVERSEES THE CAL SAVERS PROGRAM I'M HERE TODAY -- REPRESENTING TREASURER FIONA MAMA -- AND WHO IS THE CHAIR OF OUR BOARD -- TO EXPRESS HER OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURES VERY SPECIFICALLY AND NARROWLY THE CAL SAVERS. PORTION OF IT AND MOST SIMPLY PUT THE THE PROPOSAL TO TO MAKE HEALTHY RISEN OFTEN PROGRAM WOULD REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERMINED. THE BASIC PREMISE IN THE MISSION OF THE PROGRAM AND MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT. GIVE ME. THE FOREST A MORE JUST A VERY BRIEF UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIX MONTH PILOT AND WE ARE PREPARING FOR OUR FULL STATEWIDE LAUNCH ON JULY FIRST. THE PILOT REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHY AND INDUSTRY AND IT'S GOING VERY WELL WE'RE GETTNG A LOT OF GOOD. GOOD FEEDBACK SO FAR SO YOU KNOW REALLY THE THE MAIN REASON CAL SAVERS WAS ESTABLISHED IS BECAUSE AT NEARLY HALF OF WORKING CALIFORNIANS ARE ON A TRAJECTORY TO RETIRE AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. AND WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THAT IS THAT SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS WHO FOLLOW THE RULES EVERY DAY AND GO TO WORK. DON'T HAVE A WAY AN EASY WAY TO SAVE AT WORK THROUGH THEIR PAYROLL -- AND WE KNOW THAT FROM RESEARCH THAT PEOPLE ARE TWENTY TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT IF THEY HAVE AN AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT PAYROLL DEDUCTION FORM OF SAVINGS. SO REALLY THAT WAS THE MAIN PREMISE OF SENATE BILL ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THE LEGISLATURE REALLY -- TOOK BOLD INITIATIVE -- TO IMPROVE RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR FOR WORKING CALIFORNIANS -- YOU KNOW THE MAIN THE MAIN FEATURE OF THE PROGRAM REALLY IS THAT AUTOMATIC ENROLMENT FEATURE -- TO BE CLEAR PARTICIPATION IS COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY FOR EMPLOYEES THEY CAN OPT OUT AT ANY TIME -- GET BACK IN AND YOU KNOW THAT PARTICIPATION IS ABSOLUTELY VOLUNTARY NOT TO THEM THEY CAN. THAT WITHDRAW THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TAX AND PENALTY FREE IF THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND IN THE FUTURE THE REMOVAL OF THAT AUTOMATIC ENROLMENT FEATURE WOULD IN AND REPLACE IT FIND THAT WOULD REALLY REALLY UNDERMINE THE THE WITH THE INTENTION THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM. AND WOULD REDUCE OVERALL RETIREMENT PREPAREDNESS ACROSS THE STATE AND IT WOULD IT WOULD THREATEN THE PROGRAM'S LIABILITY AS WELL -- RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT AUTOMATIC IN RALEIGH ENROLLMENT -- DRAMATICALLY INCREASES PARTICIPATION AND RETIREMENT SECURITY THE BASED SOLELY ON THE CAL SAVERS PORTION OF THE PROPOSAL I TREASURE MY EXPRESSES HER OPPOSITION RECYCLING MUCH. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. WITH YOUR SUPPORT AT YOUR I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO COMMENT SPECIFICALLY ON THE BILL'S IMPACT IN REGARD TO CAL STARS. AS THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED I'M JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DO AS WELL OPPOSE THIS MEASURE UP FOR A MULTITUDE OF REASONS BUT I'D LIKE TO SPECIFICALLY COMMENT ON CAL STIRS. WE DO APPRECIATE THE CENTER'S ATTEMPT TO TRY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUT WE ACTUALLY DOING. IN FACT SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR CAL STIRS THROUGH THE BUDGET BY PROVIDING POP TO FUND SPECIFICALLY TO DISTRICTS IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM -- SEPARATE RELIEF BUT ADDITIONALLY TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT ON BEHALF OF DISTRICTS AND WE ALSO SUPPORT HIS PROPOSAL. TO ALSO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A VERY PRUDENT WAY FOR THE STATE TO SHOW ITS SUPPORT OF FULLY FUNDING CASTERS. BUT WE ALSO DO OPPOSE IT WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A MANIPULATION OF CAL STIRS A CIVIL TO MEET LIABILITIES BY USING A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATE -- I RETURNED THAT CAL STIRS WOULD BE USING THAT DOES NOT REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR INVESTMENTS ARE THEIR ASSET ALLOCATIONS WE BELIEVE THAT THE EXPERT TO CASTERS WHO ARE EXTREMELY TRANSPARENT IN HOW THEY SHOW THOSE NUMBERS. AND THEY ACTUALLY USE VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES THAT GAS BE IS REQUIRED TO ACTUALLY SHOW VARIOUS SCENARIOS SIMILAR TO WHAT THE CENTERS PROPOSED BUT THEY'VE ALSO NOTED THAT THOSE DON'T REFLECT THE PRACTICAL REALITY OF THE INVESTMENTS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE INVESTMENT RETURNS THAT CAL STIRS RECEIVES. SO IF YOU WE WERE TO USE THESE ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED NUMBERS IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY MORE THAN DOUBLE -- THAT SHORTFALL SAID THEY HAVE WHICH REALLY LEADS BEDS THE QUESTION OF IS THIS A WAY TO TRY TO DESTABILIZE PROVIDING DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS FOR CALIFORNIA'S TEACHERS AND OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT MECHANISM. TO IN SURE THAT WE CAN RETAIN TEACHERS IN OUR CLASSROOMS SO THEREFORE WE OPPOSE THE MEASURE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MEET THE VARIOUS SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND REPRESENTING NINETY SIX THOUSAND STATE EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL -- I I APOLOGIZE MY LETTER GOT IN A LITTLE LATE LAST NIGHT MY COMMENTS ARE IN THE LETTER HOWEVER JUST ONE THING I WANTED TO POINT OUT ON A REGARDING THE CAL SAVERS PROGRAM. WE LIVE IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND WE REALLY SHOULDN'T BE PUTTING UP IMPEDIMENTS TO PEOPLE SAVING FOR THEIR RETIREMENT IT'S SO PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY RETIRE WITH DIGNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU. A MISTER CHEN MEMBERS PAT READ WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT. WERE POSTED BAIL AND JUST ASSOCIATE OUR COMMENTS WITH MISTER BRANDON AND OTHERS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING. PAVE ALL RATS REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE CAN CURRENT EQUITY OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY C. T. A AND ALSO OR R. AND HARMONIZATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AS CHAIR RIGHT SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION THE NO ONE BRING IT BACK TO OUR COMMITTEE. OF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE I THINK. THERE'S SEVERAL I WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE IF YOU LIKE I MEAN I'VE. BEEN IN REHAB NOW IT'S JUST AND CHATTED I KIND OF AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE COMMENTS IN. YOU KNOW THE FINANCIAL RECORDED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- I DON'T BELIEVE ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CALPERS STIRS AND YOU SEE OUR S. ALREADY PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION IN THERE AND AND THAT USING THE TEN YEAR TREASURY. RATE IS I DON'T THINK IT'S REFLECTS THE RESPECTIVE FUNDS DIVERSITY AND HOW IT IS PLEASE OUT AND I THINK THERE'S A BUT I FIND IT DEAL CHALLENGE WITH THAT AND AND AND AND WE CAN CAL SAVERS. I THINK THIS DOES KIND OF TAKE AWAY FROM THEIR OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE PROVIDED THERE FOR OUR OUR WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT DID IS WE KNOW OF INCREASINGLY DON'T HAVE DON'T HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR FOR PLANNING AND AND PUTTING MONEY AWAY FOR RETIREMENT SUFFICIENT A FEW OF THOSE THINGS YEAH. YEAH I THINK COUPLE THINGS YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A CALPERS RETIREMENT THAT I'M CONCERNED WHEN I LOOK. THERE ARE CAL STIRS. AND WHEN THEY SAY THEY'LL BE. ACHIEVING THEIR FULL FUNDING AND THIRTY TWO YEARS FROM NOW WHICH THERE'S NO GUARANTEE. AND UP UNTIL NOW -- IT HAS BEEN AROUND VERY WELL I MEAN. YOU KNOW THERE'S DIFFERENT THINK TANKS OUT THERE THAT SAYS THEIR X. AMOUNT AND DEBT -- ANOTHER ONE I THINK IT WAS A THINK TANK FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BOSTON SAID IF YOU DID ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES LIKE YOU'RE REALLY SUPPOSED TO THEIR OVER A TRILLION IN DEBT SO. THOSE THINGS CONCERNED ME YOU KNOW A AT IN MY JOB AS I WANT TO PROTECT OVER THE SERVICE AND SOME OF THE COMMENTS BACK THERE WERE KIND OF RIDICULOUS THAT I WANT TO TAKE SAVINGS AWAY FROM PEOPLE. I'M JUST SAYING THEY NEED TO HAVE AN OPT IN NATION IS IT'S EASIER OFTEN AND IS OPT OUT THROUGH THAT SYSTEM SO NO ONE WANTS TAKE THEM AWAY. OR THE WORD DIGNITY IS BACK THERE THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IS STRICTLY TRYING TO PROTECT OVER THIS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THE WAY -- THEIR MONEY HAS BEEN MANAGE YOU TALK ABOUT THE ONE THAT TEN YEAR TREASURY THE REASON THAT IS A GOOD ONE OUT SMALLS ONE OF THE MOST STABLE ONES THAT'S THE ONE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ONCE THE PRIVATE COMPANIES TO USE BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE. THE MOST LEVEL SO EVERYTHING I'VE DONE HERE IS IS IS TRY TO PLACE LAYERS OF PROTECTION -- FOR OUR POLICE AND OUR FIRE -- BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW IT IT'S IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I REMEMBER SPEAKING TO SOMEONE I BELIEVE IT WAS SOME CALPERS COULD HAVE BEEN CAL STIRS A COUPLE YEARS AGO. AND THEY SAID THEY'RE CONFIDENT WITHIN THIRTY YEARS OF THE FULLY FUNDED AND I SAID WELL ONCE MAJORITY ARE PEOPLE GOING TO RETIRE THEY SAID THE NEXT EIGHT TO TEN YEARS I SAID HOW YOU CAN BE DOING THAT. THEY'RE NOT SO -- IF I REMEMBER IT AT DINNER ONE NIGHT I THINK YOU WERE THERE. TO GOVERNOR BROWN IF I REMEMBER HIS COMMENTS CORRECTLY -- HE SAID FOR THOSE OF US WHO MAY BE HERE IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS WHEN THAT NEXT BIG RECESSION COMES HE SAID AND AGAIN I I THINK THIS IS HIGHER RECALL IT. THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE UP PENSION SALAMI SO THAT'S ALL LOOK AT PHAM -- IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BE PROTECTED THAT SAW. ENOUGH NO SWEAT OFF FOR ME I JUST I'M DOING THIS FOR THE PLEASED TO WORK. FOR A LIVING BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED LOOKING AT THEIR FUTURE PENSIONS. THAT'S MY WHOLE REASON AND MOTIVATION FOR THE BILL NOT TO TRY. TO BROCK ANYBODY'S ABOUT. THANK YOU CENTER WERE OF THE SENATOR PAN QUESTION. KAMALA JUST STAY AT THE BRIEF COMMENT AND YOU KNOW APPRECIATE US THAT -- SEVERAL SENTIMENTS YEAH WE WORKED TOGETHER ON THE PURSE COMMITTEE AND FRAZIER -- I WOULD MAKE NOTE TO THAT -- BOTH -- PENSION FUNDS -- FIELD DAY DAY MADE THEY MADE HARD DECISIONS -- FOR TO BE SURE THAT -- THE RETURNS WERE ACTUALLY REFLECT -- THEIR PROTECT THEIR PROJECTIONS REFLECT THE ACTUAL RETURNS -- WE LOWERED THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM SEVEN POINT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOCALITIES HAD TO INCREASE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. I WOULD MAKE NOTE AND CERTAINLY THIS IS NOT THE BEST COMPARISON BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STAND -- FOR INDEX -- IF YOU GO ALL THE WAY BACK. EVEN IF YOU INCLUDE THE GREAT DEPRESSION -- AND AGAIN WE DON'T. BUT ALL OUR MONEY INTO EQUITIES -- AND INTO THE SB FIVE HUNDRED BUT THAT RETURN HAS -- IS -- GENERALLY DAN ABOUT -- NOW 9% SO OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A MIX RIGHT AND AND DID YOU WANT TO DO THE RIGHT ASSET ALLOCATION SO FORTH. SO I I DO THINK THAT USING AT TEN YEAR TREASURY RATE IS IS. IS IS A BIT LOW AND NOT THE MOST. ACTOR WAY OF DOING IT BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT THIS IS A JUDGMENT TERMS IF. YOU COULD GO FOR VERY LOW RETURN AND SAY THAT WE HAVE TO JACK UP CONTRIBUTIONS TO KEEP OUR PROMISES BUT I I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD. SEEK TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S MORE REFLECTIVE OF OF WHAT WITH. THAT THE MARKETS REALLY ARE BEHAVING. AND THE OTHER I THINK THE OTHER RIGHT AWAY REQUEST THAT WE'RE NOT. MANDATING A USED OUT AND WE'RE JUST SAYING IT'S A GOOD GUY TO GO WELL I I I WOULD I GUESS I WOULD. BEG TO DIFFER SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. AND ALSO I I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE RESEARCH ON ON RETIREMENT -- TERMS OPT IN OPT OUT FOR CAL SAVERS IS IS PRETTY STRONG AND WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS. IN TERMS OF HAVING AN OPT IN -- ATION OPT OUT IS -- GOING TO HAVE A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF PARTICIPATION AND ACTUALLY IF YOU TALK TO YOU. KNOW YOU TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT FINANCIAL COUNSELING. THEY THEY TELL YOU TO TRY TO PUT ON AUTO PAY IT SERVICE ON SADDAM VAST BECAUSE AND THE IT BECAUSE YOU SHOULD PAY YOURSELF FIRST I MEAN A PRACTICALLY EVERY. EVERY FINANCIAL ADVICE THING I'VE SEEN HAS AS THE DOW THAT'S CREDIBLE AS SAID THAT THE AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CENTER SYSTEM BASED ON THE BEST EVIDENCE AND AND PEOPLE CAN OPT OUT OF THAT ONE THAT'S THE THING IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S AN EXIT IS AN OPT -- BUT I I HOPE THAT WE TRY TO FLY THE BEST EVIDENCE WE HAVE TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO FINANCIAL SECURITY. I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO ACHIEVE I THINK ALL OF US HERE AS WELL -- SO OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR PAN -- THE COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. SEEING NONE OF IT IN THE OTHERS. I THOUGHT YOUR YOUR YOUR SENTIMENTS IN I THINK THE GOAL IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ALL. HOPEFUL FOR WISHING FOR AND I THINK IT'S JUST THE PATH THAT -- HAS BEEN DESCRIBED HERE IS A LITTLE CHALLENGING FORTUNATELY FOR ME TO SUPPORT AND SO UNFORTUNATE I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT TODAY SENATOR OR I UNDERSTAND. YEAH YEAH LOOK AT I WASN'T A GOING TO GET OUT HERE AND HELP BUT BUT I JUST STATUS AS IT IS MY CLOTHES IN HAND AND WILL WILL MOVE ON YEAH MY MOTIVATION LOOK AT LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS -- I THINK THEY'RE IN. SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THEIR ACCOUNTING PROCEDURE IS AND ALWAYS LIKE. YOU KNOW THE WAY. PEOPLE DO IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO I THINK THEIR PROBLEMS ARE. ARE GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE AND AGAIN I THINK IF WE HAVE A RECESSION COMING UP. THAT'S GOING TO REALLY PUT A DAMPER NEW THINGS AND EVEN. I THINK PUT -- TO PENSIONS IN DANGER SO THAT WOULD THAT'S MY MOTIVATION. AND THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TIME. OKAY. THANK YOU. IN A WORLD IS THERE A MOTION IS NOT A MOTION I DON'T THINK THERE'S NO REPUBLICANS I WOULD BIG A COURTESY MOTION FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE. SENATE LIKE TO I'D APPRECIATE THAT SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO MOVE THE GENTLEMAN THAT Q. -- WE HAVE A MOTION. TO PASS TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. WE CAN GET IN AFRICA OKAY -- I CAN PUT [inaudible] MOTION RIGHT [inaudible] YEAH. MOTION IS DEPRESSING PERFORATIONS HILL NO HILL NUMBER OF AYE MORRELL AYE JACKSON. NO MITCHELL NO OKAY [inaudible] NO. HEY GUYS I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME WILL BE THE ROLE BUT FOR SENATOR JACKSON AND IF IF THE BILL FAILS WOULD YOU LIKE RECONSIDERATION I WOULD. THANK YOU SIR WHO GRANTED WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU. SENATOR WIENER GOOD GOOD -- MORNING STILL IS MOVING TO ITEM NUMBER ONE WE'RE GOING. BACKWARDS BUT NOT IN. BUT IN SPIRIT SB. ONE FORTY TWO THE TITLE OF THE TWO ONE FOUR TWO EARLIER PLEASE PROCEED. THE FORTY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU DURING YOUR COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US. ON THIS BILL WHICH CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WAS PASSED OUT. LAST YEAR -- BEFORE THE GOVERNOR SADLY VETOED IT -- AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES -- PROPOSED AMENDMENTS FOR GOOGLE REGARDING THE DEPLETION OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION -- AND THE OTHER TECHNICAL -- AMENDMENTS TO THIS WILL BE A A PAGO ENFORCEMENT KIND OF SITUATION -- SO -- COLLIE SENATE BILL ONE FOR YOU TO WILL ENSURE THAT. NEW MOTHERS ARE ABLE. TO RETURN TO WORK AND TO EXPRESS -- MILK AT WORK -- AND NOT HAVE TO MAKE THE CHOICE BETWEEN BREAST FEEDING -- IN A BABY -- AND WORKING. THAT IS ACTUALLY SO WE SHOULD NOT BE IMPOSING ON A NEW MOTHERS ANYA UNFORTUNATELY -- WE ARE EFFECTIVELY IMPOSING NOT CHOICE -- WHEN WE HAVE OUR PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT TO DO NOT HAVE? A APPROPRIATE AND PRIVATE AND CLEAN -- LOCATIONS -- FOR EXPRESSING BREAST MILK -- FAMILY FROM THE WORK PLACES ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR MANY REASONS INCLUDING ACHIEVING. EQUITY IN THE WORKPLACE. WHEN -- WE DO CREATED AFFECTIVELY INCENTIVES FOR MOTHERS NOT TO RETURN TO WORK OR TO TAKE. LONGER LEAVES AND THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE WANT TO DO -- BAND UP FALLING BEHIND AND PAY EQUITY AND OTHER FORMS OF EQUITY. IN THE WORKPLACE AND UP SUFFERING. AS A RESULT WE NEED TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND WE'VE. BEEN DOING GOOD WORK IN THIS LEGISLATURE TO REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS. WE KNOW THAT MANY WOMEN ARE NOT ABLE -- TO EXPRESSED BREAST MILK A WORK -- BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY ISN'T APPROPRIATE A LOCATION -- WE PASSED A GOOD PIECE OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THAT I CO AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE MOMENT TO MAKE. TO MAKE A CRYSTAL CLEAR -- THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO PROVIDE SOME WITH SPACE NOT A TOILET. YOU ALSO HAVE TO YOU CAN'T FORCE WOMEN TO EXPRESS SMOKE IN THE RESTAURANT NOT WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP -- AND WE NOW NEED TO SET BROADER OUR STANDARDS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMóN IS A CO AUTHOR. OF THIS BILL AS WELL. WE KNOW THAT -- FOR PARTICULARLY LOWER WAGE -- WORKING WOMEN -- THE BEST CHOICES PARTICULARLY -- DIFFICULT -- AND SO THERE ARE ALSO -- MAJOR EQUITY ISSUES HERE -- IN TERMS OF HIGHER INCOME -- NEW MOTHERS AND LOWER INCOME AND LOWER WAGE WORKERS NEW MOTHERS -- WHEN -- WOMEN -- ARE -- FACED WITH THE CHOICE OF EITHER NOT WORKING -- OR BREASTFEEDING THEIR CHILD AND IF THEY CHOOSE. TO RETURN TO WORK BECAUSE I HAVE TO THAT MEANS THAT THAT CHILD -- THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE FORMULA WHICH IS VERY EXPENSIVE. AND NOT IDEAL IN TERMS OF HAVING -- THE HEALTHIEST POSSIBLE CHILD. THIS BILL SETS -- BASIC ACHIEVABLE STANDARDS -- IT -- CONTAINS MANY OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE NEGOTIATED WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY -- LAST YEAR. IT REQUIRES A A PRIVATE SPACE -- FOR EXPRESSION BREAST MILK INCLUDING A TABLE AND A CHAIR AND A POWER SOURCE. NEEDS TO BE A REFRIGERATOR AND SINK WITH RUNNING WATER CLOSE BY IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY IN THAT ROOM BUT IT HAS TO BE ACCESSIBLE -- AND WE ALSO PROVIDE. SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT COULD BE A MULTI PURPOSE ROOM -- AS LONG AS EXPRESSING BREAST MILK IS AN ACTIVITY THAT TAKES PRIORITY THERE. HOW WE GRANT SPECIAL FLEXIBILITY FOR EMPLOYERS WITH FEWER -- EMPLOYEES IN TERMS OF SEEKING EXEMPTIONS OF THERE'S A HARDSHIP -- AND THEY'RE ALSO -- NUMBER OF A SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS THAT WE NEGOTIATED LAST YEAR. IN TERMS OF MULTI TENANT BUILDINGS -- BEING ABLE TO POTENTIALLY SHARE -- SPACE SOME MEN ARE NOT A RECENT -- OFFICE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THEIR OWN -- SPECIAL -- PROVISIONS -- FOR QUEBEC CONSTRUCTION SITES UNDERSTAND THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN OFFICE SETTING. WE WORKED ON A SPECIAL APPROACH FOR THE AGRICULTURAL. SECTOR -- BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S NOT. ALWAYS THE SAME -- AND ALSO -- GAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO HAVE TEMPORARY. SPACES BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE AND THIS IN A SMALL STORE A VERY SMALL OFFICE -- YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DEDICATE A ROOM -- SO WE WORKED VERY HARD LAST YEAR TO TRY TO CREATE FLEXIBILITY. AND THAT REMAINS IN THE BILL -- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK OPERATOR AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME TODAY ARE CHEN AYE GEHRY FROM -- LEGALLY AT WORK -- ROBBINS AUSTELL FROM CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COALITION AND CURRENT FOR A LEAVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA WITH ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR WINNER OF FIRST WITNESS WHO WOULD LIKE. TO IN ORDER TO HANDLE IT WILL HAVE A KNEE I'M JENNA GARY I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK OR NON PROFIT -- LEGAL INTEREST ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS AN ADVOCATE FOR THE RIGHTS OF LOW INCOME WORKERS. SO I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY AS A CO SPONSOR IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. ONE FORTY TWO SIMPLY PUT IT SB ONE FORTY TO ENSURE THAT ALL LACTATING PARENTS CAN MEET THE BASIC NEEDS OF THEIR CHILD TO PROVIDE FOOD. WE KNOW THAT EXISTING LAW REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER TO RIDE REASONABLE BREAK TIME IN A PRIVATE SPACE THAT'S NOT A BATHROOM -- SO THAT WOMEN CAN. PUMP AT WORK BUT THESE VAGUE REQUIREMENTS ARE INSUFFICIENT OFFER REAL SUPPORT TO WORKERS PARTICULARLY LOW WAGE WORKERS. ACCORDING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DATA A THIRD OF WORKING PARENTS REPORT THAT THEY HAVE NO WORKPLACE BREAST FEEDING SUPPORTS. AND PARENTS OF THE LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOMES ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THE SUPPORT THAN THOSE WITH A HIGHER INCOME. ALTHOUGH ASSEMBLY LIMóN LOW MOANS BILL FROM LAST YEAR. THAT MADE STATE LAW CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW SUCH THAT IT CAN'T BE A BATHROOM AS OPPOSED TO A TOILET STALL IS A GOOD STEP FORWARD TO IMPROVING SUPPORTS WITHIN THE WORKPLACE IT SIMPLY DID NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. AND WE HEAR REPORTS OF THIS EVERY DAY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK WE HAVE A WORKING FAMILY HELPLINE WERE HERE FROM ABOUT. TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIA WORKERS EACH YEAR THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH ISSUES SUCH AS THIS AND I JUST WANNA SHARE THE STORY OF ONE OF OUR CLIENTS OUR CLIENT WAS A WAITRESS AT A RESTAURANT. RETURN TO WORK AFTER HAVING HER CHILD -- THERE IS NO POLICY GIVEN TO HER SHE IT WAS AFRAID TO ACTUALLY FINALLY ASKED FOR US SPACES YOU CAN PUMP THAT WORK CONTINUE TO BREAST FEED HER CHILD. SHE WAS TOLD SHE COULD USE A STORAGE ROOM THAT DON'T HAVE ANY PLACE TO SET THAT HAVE A PLACE BUT THE PUMP IT AND HAVE ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY. SHE HAD TO GET AN EXTENSION CORD SO SHE COULD ACTUALLY PLUG HER PUMP IN AND THEN SHE GOT YELLED AT BECAUSE EXTENSION CORD WAS IN THE WAY -- WE TO TRY TO RAISE THESE CONCERNS WITH HER EMPLOYER AND FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. THEY GAVE HER NO SUPPORT AND THEY BASICALLY TOLD HER OPTION WAS TO STOP BREAST FEEDING OR TO STOP WORKING. AND THIS IS JUST ONE STORY THAT WE HEAR OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND SO SB ONE FORTY TWO CAN FIX THIS AND CAN MAKE IT A REALITY. THAT WE CAN FEEL SUPPORTED IN THE CONTINUE TO BREAST FEED I'M. SO SB ONE FORTY TO ENSURE IS THAT ALL EMPLOYEES NOT JUST HIGH WAGE EARNERS NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO WORK IN OFFICES CAN HAVE THE SUPPORTS ENTITY TO BREAST FEED. SO WITH THAT I JUST ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHAIR HILL AND MEMBERS THE CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COALITION IS PLEASED TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF SB. ONE FOUR TWO THIS BILL CAN HELP TRANSFORM THE WORKPLACE CULTURE THAT IS MORE SUPPORTIVE TOWARDS THE NEEDS OF LACKEY EIGHTEEN EMPLOYEES. THE WORK FORCE HAS DRAMATICALLY EVOLVED OVER THE PAST FIFTY YEARS MOTHERS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN ARE THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE. AND MOST WANT TO BREAST FEED IN CALIFORNIA 94% OF NEW PARENTS START OF BREAST FEEDING IN THE HOSPITAL BUT AT THREE MONTHS POSTPARTUM ONLY 29% ARE FEEDING ONLY BREAST MILK TO THEIR BABIES. ALL MAJOR AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION'S URGE THAT INFANTS ONLY BE FED BREASTMILK FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF LIFE. IF YOU CAN SEE AT THREE MONTHS OF AGE MOST INFANTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT BEING FED ONLY BREAST MILK. AT THREE MONTHS OF AGE A TIME WHEN NEW PARENTS ARE RETURNING TO WORK THE WORKPLACE GREATLY IMPACTS PARENTS ABILITY TO CONTINUE BREASTFEEDING. IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THAT THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS CODE IS IMPROVED TO REQUIRE LACTATION SPACE FOR SOME NEW BUILDINGS AND WHEN THERE ARE TEN IN PROVE MEANT. FOR CERTAIN BUILDING CLASSIFICATIONS WELL WITH THE DRAMATIC INCREASE OF WOMEN WITH YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE WORK FORCE IT IS TIME THAT WE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF LACTATING EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYERS CAN EXPECT TO SEE A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT LACTATION SUPPORT IN THE WORKPLACE. HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY BILLS EMPLOYEE MORALE INCREASES EMPLOYEE LOYALTY WHICH HELPS RECRUIT AND RETAIN GOOD EMPLOYEES AND DECREASES HEALTHCARE COSTS AND ABSENTEEISM DUE TO ILLNESS. WE NEED TO IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR LACTATING PARENTS AND INCREASE BREAST FEEDING RATES PARENTS NEED CRITICAL CULTURAL AND SOCIAL CHANGE BREAST FEEDING IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. AND WE NEED WORK PLACES IS TO TAKE THE LACTATING PARENTS NEEDS INTO ACCOUNT AND I ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IF YOU COULD IF. THANK YOU. KAREN FARLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA WITH ASSOCIATION AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WE HOPE YOU WILL ALSO. HAVE ONE IMPORTANT DATA POINT FOR YOU 50% OF THE PERSON CALIFORNIA THOSE KIDS PARTICIPATE IN WORK AND MAJORITY THOSE MOMS ARE RETURNING TO WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME. AND THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE MADE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO IMPROVE THE WORK SITE SO PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS WORKING PLEASE COME FORWARD AND RENTS MENTORING THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBGYN STRYCHNINE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. CAN WAY ON BEHALF CALIFORNIANS LIMóN LAWYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARIEL VII'S I'M A RECENT A PUBLIC HEALTH GRADUATE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHRIDGE AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU WE SHOULD KILL HER BARE ARM ALSO RECENT GRADUATE FROM CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND I SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU. MY ENGRAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEE NO -- ONE IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE MORNING LORD IS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY -- AS SENATOR WIENER MENTION THIS WAS A BILL LAST YEAR SB -- NINE THIRTY SEVEN AND LAST YEAR THERE WERE SOME ADDITIONAL -- AND THE POINTS THAT WERE AMENDED OUT THAT ARE NOW BACK IN THIS BILL BUT WE ALSO -- APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT SOME ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS HAVE NOW BEEN TAKEN -- GOVERNOR BROWN VETO THE NEARER VERSION OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR AD SIGNED INTO LAW IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX LOW MOANS BILL WHICH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WORK DILIGENTLY WITH A MOAN ON THAT BILL AND SUPPORTED THAT BILL WHEN HEADED TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND BEFORE THE INK IS BARELY DRY ON THAT ISSUE NOW WE'RE NOW EXPANDING LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS AGAIN AND THAT'S OUR CONCERN IS THAT THAT HASN'T EVEN GONE INTO REALLY INTO AFFECT IT'S ONLY BEEN IN EFFECT FOR A COUPLE MONTHS NOW. AND HERE WE'RE EXPANDING THE ISSUE -- WITH SOME VERY BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS ON EMPLOYERS AND SOME OF THIS IS GOING TO GET INTO THE NITTY GRITTY AND BE QUITE BORING FOR EVERYONE BUT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IT ONE OF THE ISSUES AS WE APPRECIATE THE REMOVAL OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT THE REQUIREMENT FALLS. UNDER OF COLD LABOR CODE TWO TWO SIX AND THE LABOR CODE TWO TWO SIX VIOLATION IS CONSIDERED BY THE COURTS A WEIGHT SO YOU GET THE TWO TWO SIX PENALTY OR VIOLATION WAY -- WAGE AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT YOU STILL GET THE PENALTIES UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT AND THIS BECOMES ASTRONOMICAL FOR EMPLOYERS TO HAVE TO PAY MAKE THESE PAYOUTS. SO ESSENTIALLY IN IN OUR VIEW IT'S A DUPLICATE PENALTY EVEN THOUGH THE COURT SEE IT AS AN ADDITIONAL WAGE FOR THE EMPLOYEE AND THAT TWO TWO SIX IS STILL PART OF THE TWO TWO SIX VIOLATION IS STILL PART OF THIS. BILL ADDITIONALLY THE BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN OUT LAST YEAR THAT ARE BACK IN -- WILL APPROXIMATELY COST EMPLOYERS THIRTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED ANDFIVE THOUSAND AND EXISTING BUILDING AND MAINTENANCE ON THAT SPACE OR LOSS OF SPACE IT CAN'T BE USED FOR OTHER ISSUES. AND THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE IDEA THAT NOT A EVERY -- OFFICE NOT EVERY BUILDING IS GOING TO HAVE A WOMAN THAT MIGHT NEED THAT SPACES A LACTATION ACCOMMODATION -- ADDITIONALLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE TECHNICAL ISSUES THE AUTOMATICALLY SET EMPLOYERS UP TO FAILURE -- I KNOW SOME OF THOSE WERE TAKEN TODAY BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THE SPACE IF IT'S UTILIZED BY A IS A COMMON AREA UTILIZED. THE AND AS SUCH AS A BREAK ROOM IT HAS TO TAKE PRIORITY BUT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO PROVIDE BREAK ROOM -- AND PLACES FOR EMPLOYEES TO TAKE THEIR BREAKS SO THE EMPLOYER WOULD POTENTIALLY BE IN VIOLATION OF THE BILL IF THEY HAVE A LOCKED IN WITH MY MOTHER THAT NEEDS TO UTILIZE THE BREAK FROM FOR LACTATION PURPOSES BUT THEN ALSO HAS EMPLOYEES THAT YOU NEED TO UTILIZE THAT SAME SPACE. FOR BREAKS SO FEW OF THOSE ISSUES ARE THE REASONS WHY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY BUT UNFORTUNATE GETS PART AT THIS TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LET ME JUST -- ADD WE DID WORK DILIGENTLY WAS SENATOR. A WIENER LAST YEAR ON HIS SB NINE THIRTY SEVEN DID NOT COME TO A FINAL AGREEMENT AND DID SUPPORT TO ACTIVELY -- MISLED MOANS A. B. -- NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX I THINK YOUR ANALYSIS AS WAS DONE THOROUGHLY AND SENATOR JACKSON'S BILL IS -- REALLY SET FORTH THE ISSUES AND REYES -- THE CONCERNS THAT I THINK ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS COMMITTEE ON PAGES -- THREE BOTTOM OF THREE AND SIX WHICH IS YOU KNOW ORDER DEFICIENCIES IN NEED TO BE RECTIFIED TODAY. AND TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE BROADER DISCUSSIONS ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE GOVERNOR'S. A SUBSTANTIAL EXPANSION THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. LET ME ADD ONE ADDITIONAL POINT AND FROM HER FIRST THANKS SENATOR WIENER FOR REMOVING THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION HOWEVER I WOULD YOU CARE COULD I GET CLARIFICATION ON HOW MY BILL CERTAINLY AS PART OF THIS DISCUSSION. I SAID THE IN REFERENCE TO YOUR THAT WAS ON THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS THOROUGHLY DONE. THIS ANALYSIS JUST LIKE ON YOUR BILL ALL ALL I SEE I'M SORRY I'M I THOUGHT I MISS IT WAS A ON THERE WAS A COMPLEMENT. TO COMMITTEE STAFF I APOLOGIZE WELL I COMMITTEE OKAY TO OF COURSE THANK YOU -- LET ME JUST NOTE THOUGH WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AS MISS CURTIS DID SPECIFIED BECAUSE IT IS AN AMENDMENT IN THE LABOR CODE IT IS SUBJECT TO PAGO SO. ONE WAS TAKEN BUT ONE IS STILL THERE IF YOU WILL IN TERMS OF PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ON THE TOP OF PAGE FOUR THERE'S A DISCUSSION ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS AND THE UNDUE HARDSHIP EXEMPTION -- AS SENATOR WIENER KNOWS FROM LAST YEAR WE WOULD ADVOCATE FOR THAT TO BE APPLICABLE ACROSS THE BOARD NO ISSUE IF FOR EXAMPLE THIS STATE THE RELEVANT STATE AGENCY. OR TO CERTIFY THAT IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE TO GO AND PETITION. FOR THAT UNDE HARDSHIP EXEMPTION RATHER THAN SIMPLY CLAIM IT BY THEMSELVES BUT WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL EMPLOYERS NOT JUST SMALL BUSINESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO ONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR YES SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU SIR WIENER FOR RAIN THIS BILL FOR CERTAINLY WE WANNA TRY TO ENCOURAGE -- BREAST FEEDING AND I THINK THE CONNECTION WITH -- PARENTAL LEAVE IS THAT IDEALLY THAT -- THE PARENT WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK TOO EARLY BUT SAME TIME SINCE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PROMOTE BREAST FEEDING FOR ABOUT A YEAR WE'RE NOT GIVING A YEAR'S WORTH OF PARENTAL LEAVE WITH. THE ON THE PARTITION SPACES. BUT ONE THING I DID WANT TO CLEAR FIVE BECAUSE OF THE SURE FROM THE ANALYSIS IS AND I THINK THIS ISSUE CAME UP THE LAST TIME YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL. FOR SO FOR AN EXISTING PLAYERS IN AN EXISTING BUILDING -- BOMBINGS PRETTY EXPENSIVE TO BUILD SO THE QUESTION WAS IS THAT AND BUT IT'S AT THE SPACE THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH. THE STANDARDS WHICH WOULD ALSO INCLUDE PLENTY SO I KNOW A LOT OF OFFICES. THE ONLY PLACES THEY DO HAVE PLUMBING OUR BATHROOM. OR THEY MAY HAVE A KITCHEN OR SOME THING OF SOME SORT AND THAT'S THE BREAK ROOM ISSUE. AS A AND A AND THAT SIDE SO I CLARIFIED THAT. DO YOU NEED TO HAVE CLIMBING IN THE VERY ROOM THAT YOU'RE USING FOR LACTATION -- OR DO YOU JUST NEED A PLUMBING ACCESSIBLE BUT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE PHYSICALLY IN THE SAME SPACE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR MANY BUSINESS. BEFORE THE REFRIGERATION AND FOR THE RUNNING WATER IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE IN THE SAME SPACE IT HAS TO BE ACCESSIBLE -- SO THAT'S AND I BELIEVE THAT'S EXPLICIT IN THERE THAT'S NOT HAVE TO BE WITH IN THE SAME ROOM -- AND IN ADDITION -- THERE IS A THE SUBSECTION THE TALKS ABOUT OPERATIONAL -- FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THERE COULD BE SOME SITUATIONS THAT ARE CHALLENGING FOR THAT'S OUR INTENT -- WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO MAKE THIS INCREDIBLY HARD TO COMPLY WITH WANT FLEXIBILITY AND IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE IN THE SAME OKAY ALL RIGHT IT WASN'T CLEAR FROM ANALYSIS I FIGHT IN DEL INTO THE BILL DETAILED ENOUGH TO FIND OUT LANGUAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM. BILL. INTERJECTION THE THING VERY GOOD. THANK YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ANY -- IS THERE A MOTION TO SUPPORT I AB I'VE. AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENT SENATOR WINNER. THAT I THINK THE COMMITTEE DOES AS WELL -- AND WE DID HEAR A NUMBER OF ISSUES RAISED BY THE STAKEHOLDERS AT A WE'LL BE PROVIDING THIS ACCOMMODATION TO TO A LARGE EXTENT SO I HOPE. THAT YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO A YOU KNOW THE BILL LAST YEAR OF THE SEASON ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOANS BILL. WE COULD WORK TO GET THE LITTLE CLOSER THERE WOULD BE -- I THINK -- HELPFUL AND AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT ON THE FLOOR. ABOUT HAPPY TO TO HELP TODAY TO MOVE THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT AND TO PROCESS TO REALLY BE CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE OTHER THAN WHEN WE INTRODUCE A BILL OTHER THAN THE PR A AND THE BUILDING CODE SECTION ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE WORKED OUT WITH THE BUSINESS CAMILLUS TEAR MY STEP SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY -- AND WE APPRECIATED THEIR ENGAGE IN WITH US BUT ALL THE OTHER MOMENTS ARE IN THERE. THE P. R. IS NOW I'LL WILL I'M SURE HAVE CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE BUILDING CODE -- ISSUE -- BUT WE WE WORKED A LOT AMENDMENTS WITH -- AND BATTERERS THAT CONTINUE TO BE AND THIS BILL I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY PREFER A NARROWER -- BILL THEY DON'T WANT ALL THESE ADDITIONAL SENATOR RESPECT THEIR OPINION ON THAT AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THEY WOULD PREFER THAT NO ONE BE ABLE TO GO TO CORPS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE -- BUT YOU KNOW. WE WILL OF COURSE CONTINUE TO TO TALK TO THEM -- BUT THE BILL NEEDS TO BE WORKABLE AND ENFORCEABLE THOSE ARE MY BOTTOM LINES. THANK YOU SENATOR WHEN I AFFRONT INTERJECTION JUST BRIEFLY THE BILL DOES COME TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WILL BE CONTINUING INTO DISCUSSIONS ON THOSE ISSUES AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU. pMITCHELL.
