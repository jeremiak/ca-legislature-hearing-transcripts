ANIMAL I'M JUST CURIOUS THIS WILL PROBABLY LOOK LITIGATED AND IT WILL BE. ON THE GROUNDS OF WHETHER IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL OR NOT AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. WHAT FUN WOULD PAY FOR THAT EXPENSE? AS FAR AS BEING DEFENDED JUST LIKE ANY LAW -- THE CITY CALIFORNIA WOULD DEFEND. ANY LAW -- THAT WOULD BE LITIGATED AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE CITY CALIFORNIA WILL BE VICTORIOUS -- IN ANY POTENTIAL LITIGATION THERE WOULD BE ADVANCES THIS -- THIS LIVE SIMPLY A BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SIR MORLOCK. CENTER STONE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE THE ANGST TOWARDS -- THE EXISTING PRESENT A UNITED STATES BUT THERE ARE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS OF ONE HAS TO QUALIFIED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT YET TO BE THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD. YOU MUST BE -- NEED OF BORN A RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THERE'S NOTHING IN THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT SAY YOU MUST TURN OVER YOUR FINANCIAL RECORDS -- TO THE THE GOVERNMENT TO THE IRS FOR REVIEW -- WHAT IS BEING DONE HERE TODAY IS PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW? AND THIS IS GOING TO BE NOTHING BUT A WASTE OF TAXPAYER MONEY. OTHER PRESIDENTS NAME WILL BE ON THE BALLOT -- IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER YOU VOTE FOR THIS -- VOTED AGAINST IT. FOR REASONS THAT I SUGGEST WE VOTE AGAINST IT IS TO NOT WASTE FURTHER TAXPAYER MONEY WE SHOULD HAVE OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL INSTEAD FOCUSES EFFORTS. ON USING THAT SCARCE MONEY TO MAKE SURE WE TAKE WEAPONS OUT OF THOSE FELONS THAT ARE STILL IN POSSESSION OF THOSE WEAPONS URGING A VOTE ON SB. TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU CENTER STONE [inaudible] SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT YOU KNOW JUST THAT HIS THE PRESENT UNITED STATES. AND THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID THAT WE DIDN'T AGREE WITH. BUT AND HE WAS STILL THE PRESIDENT UNITED STATES AND DESERVE THE RESPECT OF THE OFFICE. THAT HE HELD. I AGREE THAT TIME A LOT OF YOU DON'T CARE FOR THE PRESENT UNITED STATES BUT NONETHELESS HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE IN CALIFORNIA CALL HIM. A A MOST OFTEN WE CALLED ON HIM. DURING THE ORVILLE CRISIS AND HE DELIVERED WE CALLED ON HIM DURING THE PARADISE FIRES IN THE CAMP. AND HE DELIVERED AND WE CALLED ON HIM JUST RECENTLY IN MY DISTRICT WITH THE EARTH QUAKE ISSUES AND HE DELIVERED HE IS THE PRESIDENT I'D STATES INTO CONTINUE TO CONSISTENTLY BE HOSTILE -- FROM THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY TO THE PRESENT UNITED STATES IS JUST NOT SOMETHING WE CAN. SHE DO WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO DELIVER WHAT'S BEST FOR CALIFORNIA CITIZENS. AND WHAT WE NEED HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND TO CONTINUE TO POKE THE BEAR I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY IS JUST -- IT'S NOT SOMETHING DESERVING OF THIS HOUSE AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING DESERVING OF GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE. ADAM IT'S CONSTITUTIONALLY PROHIBITED THEIR OUTLINES THAT SAY JUST AS SENATOR STONE. THIS IS SENATOR STONE JUST -- MENTIONED THEIR CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUES THAT -- YOU HAVE TO ROUTE THEIR CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO BAD TO BE PRESENT IN THE UNITED STATES IN HIS MET ALL THOSE REQUIREMENTS. AND THE PEOPLE CHOSE HIM AND SO I WOULD JUST ASK. ASK AS A BODY TO JUST. QUIT POKING THE BEAR AND JUST. I GUESS IS THE BEST WAY TO SAY IT AND TO ALLOW HIM TO BE THE PRESENT UNITED STATES. BECAUSE WHAT HE IS DOING IS CREATING JOBS AND HE IS ALSO MAKING SURE THAT -- WOULD WE IN CALIFORNIA NEED THINGS HE DOES DELIVER AND I WOULD ASK THAT YOU GUYS JUST PLEASE STOP. AND LET'S FOCUS ON THE THINGS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE. YOU KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH HERE 53% OF THE STATE SAID SEN FOUR DOUBLE TO LIVE HERE WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS. WERE FORTY SECOND IN EDUCATION SO LET'S FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA AND TRY TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A BETTER PLACE FOR CITIZENS TO LIVE AND THEM. JUST APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT FOR WHAT HE DOES FOR US. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE. IF YOU'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION BACK IN THE CHAMBER PLEASE TAKE IT OFF THE FLOOR SENATOR MORALE. MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT ALSO -- COUPLE THINGS THAT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE I I I UNDERSTAND OR YOU GUYS COME FROM. BUT ALSO. ON THOSE TAX RETURNS SOMETIMES THERE'S PERSONAL INFORMATION WOULD BE TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I'M SURE SOME OF YOU GUYS HAVE RENTAL PROPERTIES ON SO THAT YOUR SCHEDULE IN A LIST AROUND -- PROPERTIES AND YOU WOULD PROBABLY HATE FOR SOMEBODY TO GO ON BUT YOUR RENTERS IF THEY'RE AFTER YOU YOU KNOW SELF SO -- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S ROUGH BUT HERE HERE'S WHAT I I BELIEVE AND I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. THEY'RE MCGUIRE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUESTION WOULD ENJOY IT SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH. I AM I LIKE THE PHRASE -- OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF FAVORITISM TOWARDS -- NINE AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO THIS FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS BODY WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE OUR TAX RETURNS BEFORE WE RUN. ARE YOU WILLING TO DO THAT. IT'S A PRESENT YOU MAY I ASK ANSWER THAT IF YOU CARE. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE GOOD SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER IT. FOR THE PAST FORTY YEARS MEMBERS FOR THE PAST FORTY YEARS EVERY PRESIDENT. EVERYONE OF THEM. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE. HAVE PUT ASIDE THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST IN PUT THE NATION'S INTERESTS FIRST. THERE'S ONLY ONE THERE'S ONLY ONE PRESENT IS REFUSING TO RELEASE. HIS TAX RETURNS AND THAT'S PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT POKING THE BEAR. WE'RE DOING WHAT'S RIGHT. WE'RE DOING WHAT 60% OF AMERICANS WANT. AMERICANS WANT THEIR LEADER TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE. HIS OR HER TAX RETURNS. AND WHAT I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE AMENDED THIS BILL WE AMENDED THE BILL TO BE ABLE TO INCLUDE THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA. BY THE WAY GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM HAS LED THE WAY HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE HE RELEASED. EVERY TAX FOR MRS RETURN. SO DID RONALD REAGAN. GEORGE W. BUSH. GEORGE H. W. BUSH [inaudible] JIMMY CARTER [inaudible] BARACK OBAMA. WE CURRENTLY DISCLOSE MORE FINANCIAL INFORMATION. THROUGH OUR FTP SEEING CONFLICT OF INTEREST REPORTS IN THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WE IN THIS DISTINGUISHED BODY. SO IT IS CITY COUNCILMAN. SO THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. SANITATION DISTRICT MEMBERS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT -- ONLY ONES IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST LIES. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THIS. INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE CRITICAL. WE TOOK AN AMENDMENT. IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT CLEARLY SHOWS WHAT WILL BE REJECTED AND WHAT WILL NOT. TO BE ABLE. TO INSURE PRIVACY IS WITH -- WITH HELD UP PRIVATE INFORMATION IS WITHHELD. IN REJECTED ON THE INTERNET AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GOOGLE. GEORGE H. W. BUSH GEORGE W. BUSH AROUND REAGAN TAX RETURNS THOSE HAVE ALSO BEEN REDACTED. IN WE ARE INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA I'VE HEARD FROM MANY FOLKS IN ON THIS FLOOR THEY THEY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS COVERED WE ARE NOW. HAVING THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA IN THIS BILL. BIGGEST TOPIC WIRE YEAH I. EAT THEM AROUND MY QUESTION WAS. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO MAKE A BILL OR ADD THIS ON IT EVERY ONE OF US IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE STATE SENATE. REVEAL OUR TAX RETURNS BEFORE WE FILE THAT WAS MY QUESTION THIS IS THE BILL THAT IS IN FRONT OF US TODAY AND I ENCOURAGE ANY SENATOR WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THEIR OWN PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR MORALE CENTER WEINER. I THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I I I I WANT. TO REITERATE I I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE SEEMS TO ROUTE REVOLVE AROUND DONALD TRUMP THESE DAYS THE NEWS CYCLE EVERYTHING ELSE AND AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS -- BY THIS BILL DOES NOT SAY THE WORDS DONALD TRUMP -- THIS BILL APPLIES TO EVERYONE AND SO BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY KAMEL HARRISON ELIZABETH WARREN AND BERNIE SANDERS AND JOE BIDEN AND EVERYONE ELSE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DISCLOSE THEIR FORMS AND IN -- TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE GOVERNOR AND WHOEVER ELSE IS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR WE'LL HAVE TO DISCLOSE THEIR TAX RETURNS THIS APPLIES TO EVERYONE -- AND SO I THINK INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THIS PRESIDENT AS MUCH AS WE ALL DO -- WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE LONG RUN AND THE REALITY IS EVERYONE ASSUMES FOR DECADES THAT IT WAS MANDATORY THAT YOU DISCLOSE YOUR TAX RETURNS BECAUSE EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AT THE PEOPLE JUST ASSUME. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAPPENS TO REVEAL THAT -- AND MAKE CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT IT ACTUALLY ISN'T REQUIRED. AND PEOPLE WERE HORRIFIED NOT JUST BECAUSE OF DONALD TRUMP BUT BECAUSE EVERYONE. THINKS THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA BE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES WE SHOULD HAVE TRANSPARENCY -- YES THERE ARE OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THE GOVERNOR IS INCLUDED IN THIS BILL BUT LET'S BE VERY VERY CLEAR. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS A UNIQUE POSITION IN THE WORLD IT IS THE MOST POWERFUL POSITION IN THE WORLD. IT IS A POSITION WHERE YOU CAN INFLUENCE THE FUTURE OF THE ENTIRE WORLD AND SO IT IS A UNIQUE SITUATION AND THIS IS THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO. TO KNOW WHO IT IS WERE VOTING FOR I ASKED FOR AN IPO. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER SENATOR ALAN. WELL I'VE MEMBERS I ADJUSTED ANSWER THE QUESTION FROM THE THE CENTER FROM IRAN TO COOK AMONG I DO THINK THAT THE BEST ANSWER THAT WAS MADE BY. OUR FRIEND FROM HEALDSBURG IS THAT -- THAT WE ALL DO FILL OUT VERY ROBUST. FORMS TO RUN FOR THIS OFFICE THAT REALLY DO FOCUS IN ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST. I WAS PART OF WHY I THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD PROVIDE AN OPTION -- AS PART OF THIS BILL FOR PRESENCE OF CANDIDATES TO DO THE SAME SOMETHING SUBSTANTIVELY SIMILAR WHAT TO THE FORM -- SEVEN HUNDRED BUT I AM HAPPY -- TO SUPPORT THIS BILL -- AS IT IS I I DO THINK THERE ARE KIND OF CORE CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN DISCLOSURE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE AT THE HEART OF THE FOUR SEVEN HUNDRED THAT ARE ALSO AT THE HEART OF WHAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO. SO THAT VOTERS CAN HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL CONFLICTS THAT EXIST WHEN PEOPLE ARE RUNNING. FOR POSITIONS OF PUBLIC TRUST I BELIEVE THAT I'VE I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. THEY REQUIRE YOU WILLING TO TAKE A QUESTION WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA THE CENTER DO YOU WANT TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ANNOUNCE YOUR BID FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT I'M ALL IN FOR HARRIS OKAY ALL RIGHT -- TWENTY EIGHT IN THE AREA. TWENTY EIGHT GOOD STUFF. ALL RIGHT DAVE THANK YOU SAID AROUND A CENTER IN YELTSIN. THIS PRESENT LAYS DOWN THE SENATE. PERMISSION TO READ MISTER PRESIDENT [inaudible] PROCEED. GRANTED GOVERNOR BROWN AND I OVER THE DECADES OF AGREED ON A LOT OF THINGS AND DISAGREED ON SOME. HIS VETO MESSAGE OF THIS SAME MEASURE A YEAR AGO. I THINK IS INSTRUCTIVE AN APPROPRIATE. HE SAID WELL I RECOGNIZE THE POLITICAL EFFECTIVENESS EVEN THE MERITS OF GETTING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS I WORRY ABOUT THE POLITICAL PERILS OF INDIVIDUAL STATES. SEEKING TO REGULATE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN THIS MANNER. FIRST IT MAY NOT BE CONSTITUTIONAL. SECOND IT SEEMS A SLIPPERY SLOPE PRESIDENT. THE DAY WOULD REQUIRE TAX RETURNS BUT WHAT WOULD BE NEXT. FIVE YEARS OF HEALTH RETURNS RECORDS CERTIFIED BIRTH CERTIFICATE HIGH SCHOOL REPORT CARDS. AND WHILE THESE REQUIREMENTS VARY DEPENDING ON WHICH POLITICAL PARTY. IS IN POWER. DEMOCRATS MIGHT TO THINK ABOUT THE ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S. ORIGIN OF BIRTH. THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS PLEASANT. THEY MADE A FUSS OVER. MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE. AND I THINK HERE WE SHOULD MAKE A FUSS OF THIS YEAR. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT WILL SINCE WE'RE GONNA HAVE SO MUCH DISCUSSION ON CONCURRENCE I THINK WE ALREADY LITIGATED THIS BUT I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO JUMP INTO -- I DO THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT THAT THIS IS ABOUT PROTOCOL AND THIS IS ABOUT WHAT EVERY OTHER -- PRESIDENT HAS DONE AND WHY DOES HE THINK THAT HE IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT AND HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DOTHIS. SO I AM PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR WITH YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE AND I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND IT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT AND I'M HAPPY TO HAVE ANYONE LOOK AT THE LABELS TAX RETURNS. THE REALLY QUITE BORING THEY'LL PROBABLY PUT YOU TO SLEEP BUT I'M HAPPY TO PUT THEM OUT THERE IF NEED BE THANK YOU I URGE AND I VOTE. THANK YOU SIR LAY THE CENTER STERN SURE I'LL. I'LL ADD T A WONKY YOUR FINAL COMMENT -- BEFORE THE GOOD CENTER FROM THE NORTH COAST -- CLOSE IS HERE A STORE V. BROWN -- NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR REASONABLE CONDITIONS -- CAN GO FURTHER -- BUT NOT SAID SUBSTANTIVE CONDITIONS ON WHO CAN RUN SO I THINK UNDERLYING THE ENERGY OF THE CONVERSATION DAYS WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A SUBSTANTIVE CONDITION. OR NOT ON THE PRESIDENT QUALIFYING -- TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR OFFICE OUR OTHER CANDIDATES. AND THE QUESTION OF SUBMITTING-ONE FORM -- THAT IS A A GENERAL FORM IN TAX LAW THAT APPLIES UNIVERSALLY -- IS ACTUALLY NOT A SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENT BUT RATHER PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT THAT WE FEEL QUITE STRONGLY -- UNDER A STARRY DECISIS IF IT IS STILL UP HELD BY THE SUPREME COURT AND THE WEIGHT OF PRECEDENT SHOULD RELY HEAVILY IN FAVOR THIS MEASURE -- WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN CENTER DRAWS SO [inaudible] YES -- I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW. WHAT ARE THE SOURCES? OF INCOME FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS. THAT A PRESIDENT DECIDES. WHO KNOWS MAY COME BACK TO THE ISSUE OF HOW HE OR SHE IS MAKING MONEY? WHAT KIND OF INCOME THEY'RE BRINGING? YOU KNOW IS THERE A CONNECTION BETWEEN. THE PRIVATE PRISON INDUSTRY AND DETENTION CENTERS AND A SOURCE OF INCOME FOR THE PRESIDENT -- PHARMACEUTICAL THE PROFITS MADE BY PROMISE CIRCLES CAN THAT BE TRACED BACK TO THE SOURCE OF INCOME. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW. WHERE THE INCOME IS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SO THAT WE COULD KNOW IS THERE A CONNECTION TO THE KINDS OF DECISIONS AND POLICIES THAT HE OR SHE PUT FORWARD THANK YOU? THANK YOU SENATOR -- SO. SEEING NO OTHER MIKE SAT. WHY ARE YOU MAY CLOSE? THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES INTO OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES FOR A ROBUST DEBATE. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD DO THIS MORE OFTEN. RATHER THAN YELLING AT EACH OTHER WE ARE ABLE TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER. AND I GOTTA SAY IT REALLY PROUD OF THIS DISTINGUISHED BODY THAT WERE ABLE TO DO THAT AND HAVE THESE TYPE OF CONVERSATIONS WHETHER IT'S HERE ON THE FLOOR IN COMMITTEE OR IN OUR OFFICES. I'D LIKE TO FINISH WITH A COUPLE OF ITEMS IN A QUESTION. I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT GOVERNOR BROWN. GOVERNOR BROWN WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE GREATEST GOVERNORS OF OUR TIME. AND HE WASN'T A FAN OF RELEASING HIS OWN TAX RETURNS. SO I WILL SHARE WITH YOU WE HAVE HAD SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST MINDS IN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW LOOK AT THIS BILL. FORMER ETHICS ATTORNEYS. FOR PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS BOTH REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL WITHHOLD THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEST. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT CONSTITUTIONAL TESTS. S. B. TWICE AS VALID OUR AXES REQUIREMENTS OF RELEASING TAX RETURNS IS LIKE ANY OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENT. THAT STATES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE FOR EXAMPLE [inaudible] SIGNATURE GATHERING [inaudible] FILING FEES. SUBSTANTIAL DEADLINES FOR THE SECRETARY STATE. GUIDELINES THAT HAVE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. EVERYONE CAN YOU CHEAT. IN THIS BILL IF YOU DO NOT PAY YOUR TAXES OR YOU DON'T MAKE ENOUGH TO PAY TAXES. YOU CAN STILL GET ON THE BALLOT. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. DECLINE TO STATE SEN LIBERTARIANS. IF YOU PAY YOUR TAXES YOU HAVE TO RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS IT'S EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE CONSTITUTION IS VERY CLEAR. EIGHT STATES HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO IMPOSE BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS. ON TO THE PRIMARY BALLOT AND WE'VE ALSO CHECK WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IS WELL. AND THAT IS WHY WERE FOCUSED ON THE PRIMARY BALLOT. WHERE WE WILL RUN INTO CHALLENGES IF WE DO WHAT GEORGIA TRIED AND THAT IS PUTTING TERM LIMITS ON TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE MEMBERS OF THE US SENATE OR TALKING ABOUT RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS?

CENTERED AROUND YEAH THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS THIS -- AS HE TOO SIMPLIFIES THE RECALL PROCESS FOR STATE OFFICIALS. AND ENSURES THAT THE CANDIDATE WITH THE MOST VOTES WINS THE SEAT -- COURSES WILL BE PUT TO THE VOTERS TO DECIDE. CALIFORNIA'S ONE IN NINETEEN STATES THAT PERMIT THE RECALL STATE OFFICIALS THE OTHER STATES HAVE NO SUCH MECHANISM RELYING ENTIRELY UPON IMPEACHMENT. REMOVAL FROM OFFICE OR REELECTION. NOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS WITH A CURT RECALL PROCESS IS THE VOTER. CONFUSION THAT IS CREATED BY A TWO PART QUESTION THIS WRIST RESULTED IN MANY MANY PEOPLE VOTING ON THE RECALL QUESTION BUT NOT ON THE REPLACEMENT CANDIDATE. UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS ALSO POSSIBLE FOR THE INCUMBENT TO BE RECALLED EVEN IF MORE VOTES WERE CAST. TO KEEP THAT COME N OFFICE THAT WOULD THEN WORK CLASS FOR THE REPLACEMENT CANDIDATES. SO THIS ADDRESSES THIS SHORTCOMING CONFUSION IN CALIFORNIA'S RECALL PROCESS BY FOLLOWING THE SIMPLER RECALL MET MODELS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE IN ARIZONA -- NEVADA NORTH DAKOTA AND WISCONSIN [inaudible] HI. THE THE THE ESEE TO ELIMINATE THE CONFUSING YES NO RECALL QUESTION AND INSTEAD PLACE THE OFFICER BEING RECALLED ON THE BALLOT WITH THE CANDIDATES SEEKING. TO REPLACE HIM OR HER AND AFTER THE VOTES ARE TALLIED THE CANDIDATE RECEIVING THE MOST VOTES SHELL THEN WIN THE ELECTED OFFICE. I THROUGH THIS TRYING TO RECALL SINCE SIMPLIFICATION THAT WORKS VERY WELL THESE OTHER STATES -- THIS WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE CANDIDATE WITH THE MOST VOTES ACTUALLY WINS THE SEAT. AND HIS VOTERS A DIRECT CHOICE ABOUT WHETHER THEY PREFER THE INCOMING OR DIFFERENT CANDIDATES. AND I RESPECT FASTER I HAVE A THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN.

THE LEGAL NINE SEVEN THREE BY SOME IN NUMBER -- WHEN AN ECHOING HEALING ARTS? SENATOR HILL THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT -- I RISE 2%. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY THREE WHICH CLARIFIES THAT COMPLIANCE WITH THE UNITED STATES FROM WORK FORMER COPIA NATIONAL FORMULARY. IS A BASELINE LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE FOR THE COMPOUNDING OF DRUG PREPARATIONS IN CALIFORNIA CLEAR GUIDELINES FOR DRUG COMPOUNDING ARE CRUCIAL FOR THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC. SINCE UNSAFE COMPOUNDING PRACTICES CAN LEAD TO INJURY AND EVEN DEATH. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION HAS THUS FAR RECEIVE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU CENTER HILL SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT -- I STAND IN SUPPORT SOME CAUTIONS -- THE US PHARMACOPEIA IS A A RESPECTED -- A JOURNAL IF YOU WILL AND IN THE UNITED STATES THAT SET STANDARDS. FOR REALLY MANUFACTURES OF MEDICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AS YOU KNOW WITH THE ADVENT OF A TECHNOLOGY PHARMACISTS HAVE GONE BACK TO THE ROOTS OF THEIR PROFESSION WHEN. WE USED TO MAKE EVERYTHING FOR A DOCTOR'S ORDER -- BEFORE THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES GREW TO PROMINENCE AND PHARMACISTS WERE RELEGATED MORE TO A DISPENSING ROLE. IN A CONSULTING ROLE. RATHER THAN A MAKING ROLE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH. OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES IN PROVIDING. LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS. THAT DO NOT EXIST. AW IN THE UNITED STATES IN OFFERED BY COMMERCIAL PHARMACEUTICALS. EVERY DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A COMPOUNDING PHARMACY. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOMETIMES EVENTS THAT HAPPEN AND IN OUR COUNTRY WHERE. GOVERNMENT SOMETIMES HAS A KNEE JERK REACTION AND WANTS. TO REGULATE TO PREVENT. RECURRENCES OF OF ISSUES. THERE WAS A PHARMACY ON THE EAST COAST CALLED NEW ENGLAND COMPOUNDING PHARMACY -- MORE ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO. THAT WAS NOT FOLLOWING THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY ON THE EAST COAST IN MASSACHUSETTS. THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING COMPOUNDING PHARMACY. THEY TOOK THEIR EYE OFF THE BALL AND ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BECOME MORE OF A CLAUSE I MANUFACTURER. HAVING A SALES TEAM TRYING TO SELL THEIR INJECTABLE DRUGS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AND THEY WERE NOT OPERATING AS A TRUE COMPOUNDING PHARMACY. THE SAD END OF THAT STORY IS THAT. MORE THAN FIFTY PEOPLE DIED. FROM AN INCIDENT. FROM A BAD BATCH OF AN INJECTABLE. THE CAUSE OF FUNGAL MENINGITIS PROBLEM IN LEFT OVER THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE PERMANENTLY DISABLED. THIS IS A HORRIBLE INCIDENT. AND I HAVE TO SAY SENSE THEM. STATE BOARDS OF PHARMACY ACROSS THE COUNTRY [inaudible] HAVING GAUGED. LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT WE DO. AND HAVE ENACTED GREAT REGULATIONS. AND I WANT TO PAY TRIBUTE. TO OUR STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY. BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE. AND HAVE PUT FORWARD FORWARD GREAT GOOD REGULATIONS. THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN. PHARMACISTS THAT HAVE GOTTEN INTO COMPOUNDING THAT REALLY DIDN'T HAVE THE EDUCATION. TO SAFELY DISPENSE AND COMPOUND MEDICATIONS. MY FEAR WITH THIS BILL THOUGH IS. THAT THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY CAN GO BEYOND. THE USP STANDARDS. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE REGULATIONS THAT EXISTS TODAY. THE COUNT HOW MANY PHARMACIES ARE ON THE BRINK. OF NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE LIFESAVING [inaudible] MEDICATIONS. THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES I'LL GIVE YOU ONE DISCIPLINE AS AN EXAMPLE. MY COMPOUNDING PHARMACY SPECIALIZES. IN PAIN CONTROL. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE. THAT HAVE SUCH EXTENSIVE PAIN PROBLEMS [inaudible] THAT. THE ONLY MEDICATIONS THAT CAN HELP THEM. OUR YES NARCOTIC OPIATES. ANTI SPASMODIC. LOCAL ANESTHETICS. IN SOME CASES GENERAL ANESTHETICS. THAT ARE DELIVERED INTO A PUMP. THAT IS SURGICALLY IMPLANTED IN THE BODY. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU GET THE MEDICATION IN THE PALM. YES SIR A PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE. BUT THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN GET THESE MEDICATIONS AND OFTEN TIMES ARE MORE CONCENTRATED. THEN EXIST ON THE THE THE COMMERCIAL MARKET IS THROUGH A COMPOUNDING PHARMACY THAT HIS LICENSES ACCOUNT POUNDING PHARMACY. AND THEN THEY GET A STERILE COMPOUNDING LYSONS. AND HEY AS OPPOSED TO EVERY OTHER PHARMACY THAT IS TRADITIONAL GET INSPECTED EVERY YEAR. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH THESE VERY STRENUOUS AND NECESSARY SANDERS. IF WE MAKE THESE REGULATIONS TOUGHER. IF WE OVER REGULATE. WE ARE GOING TO CREATE AN ACCESS PROBLEM. FOR THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT ACTUALLY LIVE A QUALITY OF LIFE. THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE RELEGATED. TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET THE MEDICATIONS ON THE CONCENTRATIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO GO IN THERE PUMPED. THAT IS THE LIVER TO THEIR CEREBROSPINAL FLUID THAT HAVE TO BE MADE WITH NO PRESERVATIVES. BECAUSE IT'S PRESERVATIVES CAUSE TREMENDOUS DAMAGE. TO NERVES AND WE KNOW THAT OUR SPINAL COLUMN IS JUST LOADED WITH NERVE NETWORKS. SO AGAIN I I STAND IN AND KIRCHER YES VOTE. BUT I ALSO WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY THAT -- THEY NEED TO BE CAREFUL ON GOING BEYOND U. S. P. STANDARDS IN UNDERSTANDING THE RAMIFICATIONS TO ACCESS. BECAUSE WE ARE AT THAT FINE LINE NOW WERE ANY FURTHER REGULATIONS BE ON U. S. P.. COULD ACTUALLY SHOT. EVERY COMPOUNDING PHARMACY TO THE STERILE WORK IN THIS COUNTRY. AND HELP. SOME OF THE MOST PAIN AFFLICTED PATIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE THEIR ADDCTIONS CONTROL BECAUSE ONLY THE DOCTOR. CONTROL THIS PUMP THROUGH A MAGNETIC WAND. SO IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF YOUR PATIENTS THAT ARE IN YOUR DISTRICTS THE GO TO COMPOUNDING PHARMACIES WE SHOULD SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION BUT WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE A STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT EXCEEDING THOSE. REGULATIONS THE CAUSE EXTENSIVE COSTS IN THE WAY OF TESTING THAT MIGHT BE REDUNDANT. THAT WILL MAKE THESE PRODUCTS -- NOT AVAILABLE -- TO THE PATIENT'S ATTORNEY THEM I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOUR I VOTE ON EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY THREE AND THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU CENTER STONE.
