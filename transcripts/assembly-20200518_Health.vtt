THAT REVIEWS SO WE AGREE

03:18:13.481 --> 03:18:14.616
ACTUALLY WITH THE PREMISE OF

03:18:14.682 --> 03:18:16.517
THE BILL THAT NOBODY WHO'S

03:18:16.584 --> 03:18:17.852
GETTING PUBLIC FUNDS SHOULD USE

03:18:17.919 --> 03:18:19.420
THOSE PUBLIC FUNDS FOR THE

03:18:19.487 --> 03:18:21.189
PURPOSE OF ADVOCATING A BALLOT

03:18:21.256 --> 03:18:25.326
MEASURE. AND WE DON'T DO THAT-

03:18:25.393 --> 03:18:27.161
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT

03:18:27.228 --> 03:18:28.229
THIS BILL FROM IF YOUR POLICY

03:18:28.296 --> 03:18:30.632
STANDPOINT. IT'S A BAD IDEA TO

03:18:30.698 --> 03:18:31.666
CONSIDER WHETHER IT'S

03:18:31.733 --> 03:18:33.668
APPROPRIATE FOR PUBLIC FUNDS TO

03:18:33.735 --> 03:18:35.837
BE USED IT IS AN APPROPRIATE

03:18:35.903 --> 03:18:37.372
HOWEVER TO SINGLE OUT A SINGLE

03:18:37.438 --> 03:18:39.107
ORGANIZATION AND SAY THAT THEY

03:18:39.173 --> 03:18:42.343
CANNOT DO THIS. IF A BILL WHAT

03:18:42.410 --> 03:18:44.045
IF THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO LOOK

03:18:44.112 --> 03:18:46.648
AT- AT OTHER THREE FORTY BE

03:18:46.714 --> 03:18:48.983
ENTITIES OTHER ENTITIES THAT

03:18:49.050 --> 03:18:51.252
HAVE USED PUBLIC FUNDS TO FUND

03:18:51.319 --> 03:18:52.987
BALLOT MEASURES AND I'M TALKING

03:18:53.054 --> 03:18:55.089
ABOUT DEVELOPERS AND- A

03:18:55.156 --> 03:18:56.557
PROPERTY OWNERS AND LANDLORDS

03:18:56.624 --> 03:18:58.593
ETCETERA. THEY SHOULD ALSO BE

03:18:58.660 --> 03:19:00.295
PROHIBITED BEING ABLE TO USE

03:19:00.361 --> 03:19:04.265
PUBLIC FUNDS FOR THESE PURPOSES

03:19:04.332 --> 03:19:04.866
IF THAT WAS THE BILL WE WERE

03:19:04.932 --> 03:19:05.867
PROBABLY END UP SO. IT BECAUSE

03:19:05.933 --> 03:19:07.135
WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD PUBLIC

03:19:07.201 --> 03:19:09.003
POLICY IT IS NOT A GOOD PUBLIC

03:19:09.070 --> 03:19:11.406
FATHER POLICY. TO PUNISH A

03:19:11.472 --> 03:19:13.741
SINGLE ORGANIZATION AGAIN FOR

03:19:13.808 --> 03:19:15.543
STEPPING OUT. IN FRONT ON THIS

03:19:15.610 --> 03:19:18.179

THE- TWO TO CLOSE WITH- THAT

03:19:21.015 --> 03:19:23.117
PART OF THE OTHER- POLICY

03:19:23.184 --> 03:19:25.153
QUESTION IS WHETHER IT IS EVEN

03:19:25.219 --> 03:19:27.088
APPROPRIATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA

03:19:27.155 --> 03:19:28.556

OR SET NOT RAMBLERS AROUND HOW

03:19:42.770 --> 03:19:45.206
THE MONEY CAN BE SPENT- SO IT

03:19:45.273 --> 03:19:46.674
IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT

03:50:30.816 --> 03:50:32.852
BETTER FOR OTHER PURPOSES. WHEN

YOU LOOK AT POLLING DATA THAT

03:50:34.854 --> 03:50:36.722

AGAIN IN ONE MANUFACTURER

03:52:15.288 --> 03:52:16.422
HAPPENED IN THE NINETEEN

03:52:16.489 --> 03:52:18.224
SEVENTIES WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY

03:52:49.922 --> 03:52:51.724
NO GOOD REASONS WHY IT. WHAT IT

03:52:51.791 --> 03:52:55.027
DOES. I THINK THAT THIS BILL IS

03:52:55.094 --> 03:52:56.529
ONLY PART OF ADDRESSING THAT

03:52:56.595 --> 03:52:57.797

ANSWERING THAT QUESTION

03:53:09.342 --> 03:53:10.343
COMMITTEE GOING A LITTLE BIT

03:53:10.409 --> 03:53:11.544

03:53:11.610 --> 03:53:14.513
SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO. IF

03:53:14.580 --> 03:53:17.883
CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW LIMITS.

COST SHARING TWO TWO AND A

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THEN THE

03:53:22.855 --> 03:53:24.123
QUESTION I THINK FOR THIS

03:53:24.190 --> 03:53:25.658
COMMITTEE AND AS A MATTER OF

03:53:25.725 --> 03:53:28.194
PUBLIC POLICY. WHY WOULD WE

03:53:28.260 --> 03:53:31.497
SPECIFICALLY CALL OUT INSULIN

03:53:31.564 --> 03:53:33.099
AND NOT CAP CALL OUT OTHER

03:53:33.165 --> 03:53:35.101
DRUGS AS WELL OR SHOULD WE COME

03:53:35.167 --> 03:53:36.369
UP WITH SOME SORT OF FORMULA

03:53:36.435 --> 03:53:38.337
AIRY FOR THAT OR SHOULD WE TAKE

03:53:38.404 --> 03:53:39.638
THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS

03:53:39.705 --> 03:53:41.574
THAT'S THE CURRENT TO DROP TO

03:53:41.640 --> 03:53:42.508
DROP THAT. WE DO KNOW THE

03:53:42.575 --> 03:53:44.210
INSULIN IS A LIFE SAVING DRUG

03:53:44.276 --> 03:53:45.044
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER

03:53:45.111 --> 03:53:47.113
LIFESAVING. DRUGS AS WELL AND

03:53:47.179 --> 03:53:49.782

AS PUBLIC POLICY IS THERE A

03:53:51.517 --> 03:53:53.252
SPECIFIC REASON WHY THIS AND

03:53:53.319 --> 03:53:55.821
NOT OTHER. DRUGS SHOULD BE IT

03:53:55.888 --> 03:54:00.726
SHOULD BE CALLED OUT. YOU MAY

03:54:00.793 --> 03:54:05.798
GO IN THEIR CHARACTER. YES THIS

03:54:05.865 --> 03:54:07.666
IS DOCTOR PRE UP AGAIN- I THINK

03:54:07.733 --> 03:54:10.503
INSULIN IS FAIRLY UNIQUE THERE

03:54:10.569 --> 03:54:11.103
MAY BE AN ARGUMENT FOR PUTTING

03:54:11.170 --> 03:54:13.239
OUT. SIMILAR CAP ON OTHER

03:54:13.305 --> 03:54:14.940
MEDICATIONS AS WELL BUT THIS IS

03:54:15.007 --> 03:54:16.709
A MEDICATION THAT PARTICULARLY

03:54:16.776 --> 03:54:17.643
FOR PEOPLE WITH TYPE ONE

03:54:17.710 --> 03:54:20.413

I'M A CO INCREASE IN PRICE AND-

03:54:37.163 --> 03:54:39.665
I THINK THAT. AB CALLS FOR THIS

03:54:39.732 --> 03:54:41.700
SORT OF ACTION IT MAY NOT BE

03:54:41.767 --> 03:54:43.502

03:58:30.396 --> 03:58:32.398
I WILL SAY THAT- YOU KNOW MANY

03:58:32.464 --> 03:58:34.733
OF OUR PLANS AND I NATIONALLY

03:58:34.800 --> 03:58:36.802
HAVE- IMPLEMENTED STRATEGIES TO

03:58:36.869 --> 03:58:38.570
ACHIEVE OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE

03:58:38.637 --> 03:58:40.339
ACTUALLY LOWER. ON THEN THIS

03:58:40.406 --> 03:58:42.241
BILL BUT THEIR ABILITY TO DO

03:58:42.307 --> 03:58:43.475
THAT IS REALLY BASED ON THE

03:58:43.542 --> 03:58:44.510
RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY HAVE

03:58:44.576 --> 03:58:45.377
WITH THE RIVER THE

03:58:45.444 --> 03:58:46.745
MANUFACTURERS IF YOU

03:58:46.812 --> 03:58:48.681
LEGISLATIVE LEE INSTITUTE A

03:58:48.747 --> 03:58:51.784
PRICE CONTROL ON ONE SIDE OF

03:58:51.850 --> 03:58:54.219
THOSE OF THAT RELATIONSHIP- YOU

03:58:54.286 --> 03:58:55.854
CAN IMAGINE. WHAT THE INCENTIVE

03:58:55.921 --> 03:58:57.356
WOULD BE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO

03:58:57.423 --> 03:58:58.757
YOU- YOU KNOW ESTABLISH THE

03:58:58.824 --> 03:59:00.259
RIGHT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP AND

03:59:00.325 --> 03:59:02.594
ARRANGEMENTS. ON THAT ALLOW FOR

03:59:02.661 --> 03:59:04.396
LOWER OUT OF POCKET COSTS SO-

03:59:04.463 --> 03:59:05.831
IN AND I WOULD ALSO POINT TO

03:59:05.898 --> 03:59:07.433
THE CHIPPER ANALYSIS WHICH IS

03:59:07.499 --> 03:59:08.767
ALSO REFLECTED IN IN YOUR

03:59:08.834 --> 03:59:10.536
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH STATES

03:59:10.602 --> 03:59:12.337
THAT. YOU KNOW THE EVIDENCE THE

03:59:12.404 --> 03:59:14.239
RESEARCH DOESN'T NECESSARILY

03:59:14.306 --> 03:59:15.507
POINT TO BETTER IT HERE ANSWER

03:59:15.574 --> 03:59:21.146
OUTCOMES. ON BASED ON ON COPAY.

03:59:21.213 --> 03:59:21.980
CAPS SO. I I'LL JUST LEAVE IT

03:59:22.047 --> 03:59:23.949
AT THAT. THANK YOU. I GUESS

03:59:24.016 --> 03:59:25.150
ASKING OTHER QUESTIONS THAT.

03:59:25.217 --> 03:59:27.886
THAT THAT MAY BE THE CASE GEN

03:59:27.953 --> 03:59:29.722
WHAT USE WERE GENERICALLY WITH

03:59:29.788 --> 03:59:31.690
CO PAY CAPS BUT THIS IS A VERY

03:59:31.757 --> 03:59:32.891
DIFFERENT MEDICATION AND WE

03:59:32.958 --> 03:59:34.860
HEAR. ALL THE TIME THAT PEOPLE

03:59:34.927 --> 03:59:35.928
HAVE A HARD TIME AFFORDING

03:59:35.994 --> 03:59:38.163
INSULIN. SO ONE THE QUESTION I

03:59:38.230 --> 03:59:40.733
HAVE FOR YOU AS I I'M NOT AWARE

03:59:40.799 --> 03:59:41.233
THAT THERE'S ANY GENERIC

03:59:41.300 --> 03:59:45.104
INSULIN. CORRECT YEAH- THAT'S

03:59:45.170 --> 03:59:48.307
MY UNDERSTANDING AS WELL- AND I

03:59:48.373 --> 03:59:49.608
KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF EFFORTS

03:59:49.675 --> 03:59:51.777
INCLUDING- YOU KNOW AT LEAST AT

03:59:51.844 --> 03:59:53.412
AT. ONE OF OUR HEALTH PLANS IS

03:59:53.479 --> 03:59:55.247
INVOLVED. IN AN EFFORT TO TRY

03:59:55.314 --> 03:59:58.217
TO- TRY TO CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC-

03:59:58.283 --> 03:59:59.351
SO YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL

03:59:59.418 --> 04:00:00.686
SEE HOW FAR THEY GO THERE SO

04:00:00.753 --> 04:00:02.488
THAT WOULD BE VERY- THAT WOULD

04:00:02.554 --> 04:00:04.590
BE VERY POSITIVE- DEVELOPED IT

04:00:04.656 --> 04:00:06.825
AS WELL. BUT I WILL SEE NEEDING

04:00:06.892 --> 04:00:08.060
YOU KIND OF ALLUDED TO THIS IN

04:00:08.127 --> 04:00:09.461
YOUR COMMENT I DO WANT TO SAY

04:00:09.528 --> 04:00:10.763
THAT I MEAN WE DO HAVE A

04:00:10.829 --> 04:00:11.864
TECHNICAL COMPLIANCE PROBLEM

04:00:11.930 --> 04:00:13.799
WITH. CARVING OUT A DIFFERENT

04:00:13.866 --> 04:00:16.869
COPAY CAP FOR SPECIFIC DRUGS.

04:00:16.935 --> 04:00:19.204
AND YOU KNOW I WON'T- YOU KNOW

04:00:19.271 --> 04:00:20.272
BORE YOU WITH ALL THE

04:00:20.339 --> 04:00:22.341
TECHNICALITIES BUT THEIR- ALL

04:00:22.407 --> 04:00:24.143
OF HEALTH PLAN PRODUCTS- BETTER

04:00:24.209 --> 04:00:26.378
OFFER TO COVER CALIFORNIA HAVE

04:00:26.445 --> 04:00:28.113
TO ACHIEVE AN ACTUARIAL VALUE.

04:00:28.180 --> 04:00:31.950
SO THAT MEANS- IF YOU ALTER THE

04:00:32.017 --> 04:00:33.318
OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR ONE

04:00:33.385 --> 04:00:36.255
SERVICE- YOU MAY HAVE TO. YOU

04:00:36.321 --> 04:00:37.689
MAY BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU

04:00:37.756 --> 04:00:40.058
HAVE TO MAKE UP THOSE. COSTS

04:00:40.125 --> 04:00:41.660
WITH RESPECT TO OTHER SERVICES

04:00:41.727 --> 04:00:43.428
AND- YOU KNOW OUR FOLKS ARE

04:00:43.495 --> 04:00:44.797
LOOKING AT THIS BILL TO BELIEVE

04:00:44.863 --> 04:00:46.198
THAT A SEPARATE COPAY CAP FOR

04:00:46.265 --> 04:00:48.000
INSULIN WILL. REDUCE THE

04:00:48.066 --> 04:00:49.568
FLEXIBILITY ON PLAN BENEFIT

04:00:49.635 --> 04:00:51.904
DESIGN- YOU KNOW HOW TO COVER

04:00:51.970 --> 04:00:53.939
CALIFORNIA WHICH COULD IN YOU

04:00:54.006 --> 04:00:55.307
KNOW. I THINK SOME MORE NOW

04:00:55.374 --> 04:00:57.109
SEEMS TO BE DONE ON THIS COULD.

04:00:57.176 --> 04:00:58.710
MEAN THAT YOU KNOW. OUT OF

04:00:58.777 --> 04:00:59.812
POCKET COSTS FOR OTHER SERVICES

04:00:59.878 --> 04:01:03.415
MIGHT HAVE TO BE ALTERED TO

04:01:03.482 --> 04:01:04.016
MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. DO YOU

04:01:04.082 --> 04:01:06.185
HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH. HOW

04:01:06.251 --> 04:01:08.020
MUCHCALIFORNIA'S PAY AND

04:01:08.086 --> 04:01:09.688
HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS EACH YEAR

04:01:09.755 --> 04:01:11.256
ROUGHLY HOW MANY BILLION

04:01:11.323 --> 04:01:15.661
DOLLARS. I HAVE A DON'T HAVE

04:01:15.727 --> 04:01:17.429
THAT NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME BUT

04:01:17.496 --> 04:01:22.367
ROUGHLY. I MEAN IT'S IT IT'S IN

04:01:22.434 --> 04:01:25.871
THE HUNDREDS OF. YEAH THAT

04:01:25.938 --> 04:01:27.406
HUNDRED BILLION MAYBE MORE OR

04:01:27.472 --> 04:01:29.141
LESS LIKE YOU KNOW I I'D BE

04:01:29.208 --> 04:01:30.943
TAKING A WHILE YES I DO KNOW.

04:01:31.009 --> 04:01:33.879
THAT HEALTH PLANS PAID NEARLY

04:01:33.946 --> 04:01:35.247
BACK TEN BILLION DOLLARS JUST

04:01:35.314 --> 04:01:37.216
SOME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ALONE

04:01:37.282 --> 04:01:38.851
WHICH IS YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT

04:01:38.917 --> 04:01:41.386
YOU KNOW PERCENTAGE OF THE- OF

04:01:41.453 --> 04:01:43.288
THE HEALTHCARE PREMIUM DOLLAR.

04:01:43.355 --> 04:01:46.024
SO IN THE HUNDRED PLUS BILLION

04:01:46.091 --> 04:01:47.226
DOLLARS IN PREMIUMS WERE

04:01:47.292 --> 04:01:49.027
TALKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL

04:01:49.094 --> 04:01:50.629
ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AT WITH

04:01:50.696 --> 04:01:53.532
AN M. AND YOU'RE TALKING WE'RE

04:01:53.599 --> 04:01:54.132
TALKING ABOUT PREMIUMS WITH A

04:01:54.199 --> 04:01:57.236
BE AND SO I THINK THE COST S

04:01:57.302 --> 04:01:59.204
PRETTY SMALL. I WOULD SAY ALSO

04:01:59.271 --> 04:02:01.173
THAT THERE IS A SUNSET WITH

04:02:01.240 --> 04:02:04.843
THIS AS WELL. SO IF. IT

04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:07.846
HEARINGS DOESN'T CHANGE- THIS

04:02:07.913 --> 04:02:09.014
THIS POTENTIALLY WILL BE

04:02:09.081 --> 04:02:11.350
REEVALUATED AND MAYBE THERE'S

04:02:11.416 --> 04:02:11.950
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT TO GO

04:02:12.017 --> 04:02:14.620
AWAY. BUT I'D- BUT WE DON'T

04:02:14.686 --> 04:02:18.156
REALLY KNOW- FOR SURE. OTHER

04:02:18.223 --> 04:02:19.458
THAN WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE CAN'T

04:02:19.524 --> 04:02:21.827
AFFORD THEIR INSULIN- RIGHT NOW

04:02:21.894 --> 04:02:23.161
SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW FOR

04:02:23.228 --> 04:02:24.596
SURE HOW MUCH OF A POSITIVE

04:02:24.663 --> 04:02:26.465
IMPACT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY

04:02:26.531 --> 04:02:28.901
HAVE AND MAYBE. SAVE THE

04:02:28.967 --> 04:02:31.003
INDUSTRY A LOT OF MONEY WE

04:02:31.069 --> 04:02:32.404
DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE YET

04:02:32.471 --> 04:02:34.039
BUT THAT'S WHY THERE'S A SUNSET

04:02:34.106 --> 04:02:35.741
ON THIS IT WILL GO BACK AND RE

04:02:35.807 --> 04:02:40.078
EVALUATE THAT. SO I YOU KNOW I

04:02:40.145 --> 04:02:41.513
I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL AS WHY

04:02:41.580 --> 04:02:42.581
IS ONE REASON I ASKED TO BE A

04:02:42.648 --> 04:02:44.249
CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILLS I DO

04:02:44.316 --> 04:02:46.018
BELIEVE THIS. I AM DISTURBED BY

04:02:46.084 --> 04:02:47.753
WILL MAKE A COMMENT HERE WHICH

04:02:47.819 --> 04:02:48.520
I WILL ALSO MAKE AN BUDGET

COMMITTEE. THAT ON OF I'M

04:02:51.323 --> 04:02:53.225
DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT- WITH

04:02:53.292 --> 04:02:54.593
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT WE HAVE

04:02:54.660 --> 04:02:55.928
FOUR MILLION PEOPLE ON INSULIN

04:02:55.994 --> 04:02:59.431
CALIFORNIA. POTENTIALLY 50% OF

04:02:59.498 --> 04:03:00.232
THE POPULATION BEING PRE

04:03:00.299 --> 04:03:02.734
DIABETIC THAT- IN THE

04:03:02.801 --> 04:03:04.336

DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM.

04:03:09.341 --> 04:03:11.710
WHICH IS ALMOST WHICH IS LIKE

04:03:11.777 --> 04:03:12.311
NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

04:03:12.377 --> 04:03:15.414
NOT VERY MUCH MONEY. WHEN YOU

04:03:15.480 --> 04:03:16.014
CONSIDER HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE

04:03:16.081 --> 04:03:17.182
SPENDING ON DIABETES THE STATE

04:03:17.249 --> 04:03:19.418

COMES TO JUST THE

05:18:31.792 --> 05:18:33.461
ACCESSIBILITY. OVER GETTING

05:18:33.527 --> 05:18:36.430
FOLKS TO CONTINUE- WITH

05:18:36.497 --> 05:18:37.231
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE

05:18:37.298 --> 05:18:39.767
POTENTIALLY HARMFUL TO THEIR

05:18:39.834 --> 05:18:41.168
LIVES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME.

05:18:41.235 --> 05:18:45.606
REDUCING FUNDING THAT HELPS

05:18:45.673 --> 05:18:48.108
PEOPLE GET OFF SUBSTANCE ABUSE

05:18:48.175 --> 05:18:49.376
AND HELPS WITH THEIR DRUG

05:18:49.443 --> 05:18:52.746
ADDICTION SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S

05:18:52.813 --> 05:18:55.216
THE IT'S A- IS THE LEGISLATION

05:18:55.282 --> 05:18:57.117
THAT'S BOLD AND HAVE A LOT OF

05:18:57.184 --> 05:18:59.086
INITIATIVE BEHIND IT BUT AT THE

05:18:59.153 --> 05:19:02.256
SAME TIME. THE SAFETY NET FOR

05:19:02.323 --> 05:19:04.425
INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED THAT

05:19:04.492 --> 05:19:07.428
SUPPORT. IS ACTUALLY RECEIVING

05:19:07.495 --> 05:19:09.430
LESS FUNDING. AND SO I'M I'M

05:19:09.497 --> 05:19:11.265

05:19:11.332 --> 05:19:12.666
IN THE CITY OF LA IN THE

05:19:12.733 --> 05:19:14.001

INDIVIDUALS WITH SYRINGES.

05:19:25.145 --> 05:19:26.547

WILL CALL UP THE RACK RATE- WE

06:09:16.634 --> 06:09:18.102
NEED TO KNOW WHAT THAT

06:09:18.169 --> 06:09:19.403
CONTRACTED RATE IS BECAUSE

06:09:19.470 --> 06:09:20.838
THAT'S THE TRUE REFLECTION OF

06:09:20.905 --> 06:09:22.607
EXPENDITURES. AND IS REALLY

06:09:22.673 --> 06:09:25.042
