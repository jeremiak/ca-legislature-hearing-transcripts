SOLUTION AND THE GOAL HERE WAS

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.582
INTENDED TO WE BELIEVE CALM THE

INTO THE DEPARTMENT. AND WE

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:32.365
BELIEVE CONTRAST TO SOME

DISCRIMINATORY THE DEPARTMENT

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.783
HAS APPROVED THE INCREASE.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.752
UNFORTUNATELY THIS ALREADY

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.620

RE INSURANCE COVERAGE IS NOT A

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:49.642
IT'S REALLY HARD TO BE ABLE TO

BROAD SWATH. THAT CAN BE TAKEN.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:01.787
THUS WE BELIEVE COMPLICATING

00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:03.255
EFFORTS TO OVERSEE THE TRUE

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:05.357
ACTUAL COST INVOLVED FOR STATES

AS DIVERSE AND VARIED AS AS

CALIFORNIA. INSURERS WOULD ALSO

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.999
LIKE TO USE CATASTROPHIC

THE PREDICTIVE ABILITY HAS

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:33.419
LIMITATIONS AND AS THE COMEDIAN

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:36.155
ALICE'S INDICATED STILL IN ITS

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:38.657
EARLY ADOLESCENCE. SOLELY

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:39.959
ALLOWING INSURERS TO CHARGE

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.727
EVEN MORE FOR INSURANCE IS NOT

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:42.294
GOING TO MAKE THE INSURANCE

00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:45.865
MARKET PLACE. A SOLELY BETTER.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.800
ESPECIALLY SINCE NO INSURERS TO

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:48.767
THE DEPARTMENTS KNOWLEDGE TO

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:50.536
DATE. HAVE GUARANTEED THEY

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.904

00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:53.105
HIGHER WILD FIRE EXPOSURE

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.040
BUSINESS ESPECIALLY WHEN IN THE

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:56.475

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.043
INCLUDE THE REINSURANCE COSTS

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.411
ENTIRELY AND RISK MODEL

00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:01.213
PROJECTIONS AND THE RATES. SO

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.482
THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:03.949
CONSIDERATION THAT THE

00:19:57.629 --> 00:19:59.831
WILL RELY UPON EITHER THE NON

00:19:59.898 --> 00:20:00.399
ADMITTED MARKET OR THE FAIR

00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:03.368
PLAN. A LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR

00:20:03.435 --> 00:20:05.137
HIGH RISK AREAS MUST INVOLVE

00:20:05.203 --> 00:20:06.204
RESTORATION OF THE VOLUNTARY

00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:07.906
MARKET. WHICH REQUIRES A

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:09.041
THOUGHTFUL BALANCING OF

00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:11.944
UNDERWRITING RATING AND CLAIMS.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:12.945
THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND

00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:15.581
COVERED WELL THE COMPLICATED

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:16.081
PUSH AND PULL THAT THIS

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:18.617
INVOLVES. RESTRICTING ONE OF

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:19.952
THESE FACTORS WILL LEAD TO A

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:22.354
REACTION AND ANOTHER. IF RATES

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:24.856
ARE HELD TO LOW IN AN INSURABLE

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:25.591
GENERALLY PULL BACK ON

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:27.326
UNDERWRITING MEANING KEEPING

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:28.727
FEWER HIGH RISK PROPERTIES IN

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:30.529
ORDER TO STAY SOLVENT.

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:31.964
MANDATING INCREASE CLAIMS

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.832
PAYMENTS WILL REQUIRED INSURER

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:36.168
TO THEN SEEK HIGHER RATES.

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:37.202
WHICH IF THE KNIGHT WILL LEAD

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:38.870
TO STRICTER UNDERWRITING. IN

00:20:38.937 --> 00:20:40.472
THE END AN INSURER CANNOT

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:43.008
OPERATE SAFELY AT LOW RATES

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:44.643
WELL TAKING ALL RISKS AND

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.312
PAYING EVER INCREASING CLAIMS.

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:49.648
SO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:52.317
INSURANCE HAS A COMPLICATED JOB.

00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:53.885
THE CURRENT AVAILABILITY ISSUES

00:20:53.952 --> 00:20:55.487
FOR HIGH FIRE RISK COMMUNITIES

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:56.622
ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO

00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:58.457
UNSUSTAINABLY LOW STATEWIDE

00:20:58.523 --> 00:21:00.392
AVERAGE PRICE LEVELS. AND IN

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.494
YOUR PACKET I'VE OFFERED US A

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:04.896
FEW SLIDES JUST PUT SOME

00:21:04.963 --> 00:21:10.369

SLIDE ONE CALIFORNIA'S. PREMIUM

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:18.210
IS SHOWN TO BE 17% BELOW THE

00:21:18.276 --> 00:21:22.047
NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND IT'S ALSO

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:27.853

GETTING THE PRETTY SLIDE DOWN.

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.565
SO CALIFORNIA'S AVERAGE PREMIUM

00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:43.835
A 17% THIS IS USING THE LATEST

00:21:43.902 --> 00:21:44.403
ANY I SEE DATA THAT CAME OUT

00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:47.606
LAST MONTH. IT'S 17% BELOW THE

00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:49.474
NATIONAL AVERAGE IN ALMOST ONE

00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:50.876
HALF OF THE AVERAGE PRICE IN

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:52.711
HURRICANE STATES LIKE LOUISIANA

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:54.813
AND FLORIDA. EVEN THOUGH IT IS

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.315
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE TO

00:21:57.382 --> 00:21:57.916
REBUILD A HOME IN THOSE LOWER

HAS RISEN 53% IN THE LAST TEN

00:22:05.123 --> 00:22:07.859
YEARS. IT IS RISEN TEN POINT 6%

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:12.097
IN CALIFORNIA. MOVING TO SLIDE

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:14.066
TO IT SHOWS HOW CALIFORNIA HAS

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:15.333
DIVERGED FROM THE REST OF THE

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.571
COUNTRY. OVER TIME. AGAIN USING

00:22:19.638 --> 00:22:22.874
ANY I SEE DATA. THE ORANGE BAR

00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:24.810
IS THE MOVEMENT AND NATIONAL

00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:28.513
PRICING THE- MAROON ASH BAR IS

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.851
CALIFORNIA. NOT ALLOWING PRICES

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:34.486
TO INCREASE WITH THE ECONOMY

00:22:34.553 --> 00:22:36.555
MAY WORK IN THE SHORT TERM BUT

00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:38.657
OVER TIME WILL LEAD TO MUCH

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:41.927
HIGHER CATCH UP INCREASES LATER.

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:42.494
THAT ARE A SHOCK TO ORDINARY

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:44.563
HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS. MOVING TO

00:22:44.629 --> 00:22:48.033
SLIDE THREE STARTING IN TWO

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:52.771
INSURANCE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:53.972
FACED A PERIOD OF LOW

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:55.907
CATASTROPHE LOSSES. BUT EACH

00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:57.642
YEAR GENERATED A MODEST

INDUSTRY WIDE UNDERWRITING

00:22:58.777 --> 00:23:00.812

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:03.415
BARS ON INDUSTRY WIDE BASIS AND

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:04.983
WHEN COMBINED OVER TIME YOU CAN

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.084
SEE WITH THE BLUE LINE IT

00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:07.652
CULMINATED IN A TEN POINT TWO

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.454
BILLION DOLLAR HISTORIC

TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE. DURING

00:23:14.126 --> 00:23:15.961
THIS TIME THE CD I BECAME

00:23:16.027 --> 00:23:17.696
CONCERNED. THAT HOMEOWNERS

00:23:17.763 --> 00:23:19.798
INSURANCE PRICES WERE TOO HIGH

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:21.500
RELATIVE TO THESE LOW LOSSES.

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:22.901
AND BEGAN ASKING INSURERS

00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:23.468
WHETHER THE PRICES WERE TOO

00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:26.171
HIGH. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CD

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:27.706
I EVEN ORDERED THE STATE'S

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:28.473
LARGEST HOMEOWNERS INSURER

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.475
STATE FARM. TO REDUCE ITS RATE

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:32.778
LEVEL BY 7% EVEN THOUGH THE

00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:34.279
COMPANY WAS SEEKING A 6%

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:36.615
INCREASE. THAT MATTER IS STILL

00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:38.617
IN LITIGATION AND STATE FARM IS

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:39.718
CURRENTLY CHARGING THE SAME

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:41.520
PRICE IT WAS FIRST PERMITTED TO

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:44.189
CHARGE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. WHAT

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:45.690
COMPANY CAN CONTINUE BUSINESS

00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:47.459
AS USUAL WITHOUT A PRICE

00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:50.796
INCREASE IN FIVE YEARS. ALSO

00:23:50.862 --> 00:23:52.798
SLIDE THREE INDICATES THINGS

00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:55.734
CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN TWENTY

00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:56.635
SEVENTEEN WHEN THE CUMULATIVE

00:23:56.701 --> 00:23:57.569
INDUSTRY WIDE UNDERWRITING

00:23:57.636 --> 00:24:00.572
PROFIT DATING BACK TO NINETEEN

00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:01.540
NINETY ONE WAS A RACE IN A

00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:02.874
SINGLE YEAR. THAT'S THAT LARGE

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:05.443
RED BAR. THEN THERE WAS A

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.313
REPEAT. THE NEXT YEAR AND

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.415
TWENTY EIGHTEEN. GIVEN THE

00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:11.850
EXPECTED ACCELERATION OF

00:24:11.917 --> 00:24:13.218
CATASTROPHIC FIRE LOSSES

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:15.287
pRELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:24:15.353 --> 00:24:16.188
THE DECISION BY MOODY'S

00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:17.656
INVESTOR SERVICES TO ELEVATE

00:24:17.722 --> 00:24:19.591
WILD FIRE TO A TOP TIER CREDIT

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:21.459
RATING FACTOR. THERE

00:24:21.526 --> 00:24:23.128
SIGNIFICANT ENSURE A CONCERN

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:24.329
ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF

00:24:24.396 --> 00:24:25.931
CURRENTLY APPROVED PRICE LEVELS

00:24:25.997 --> 00:24:27.866
IN CALIFORNIA. THIS CONCERN

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:28.967
WILL LIKELY CONSTRAIN

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:31.203
AVAILABILITY IN HIGH FIRE RISK

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:32.871
AREAS UNTIL IT IS ADDRESSED.

00:24:32.938 --> 00:24:36.842
THE LAST SLIDE. A SLIDE FORWARD

00:24:36.908 --> 00:24:38.376
SHOWS THAT THIS SITUATION IS

00:24:38.443 --> 00:24:39.945
COMPLICATED IT'S COMPLICATED

00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:41.513
FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.147
COMPLICATED FOR THE DEPARTMENT

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:44.182
OF INSURANCE IN THE LAST TWO

00:24:44.249 --> 00:24:46.785
YEARS OVER FIFTY INSURERS HAVE

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:47.385
SOUGHT RATE INCREASES FROM THE

00:24:47.452 --> 00:24:49.554
CD I. AND WHILE THE AVERAGE

00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:51.356
RATE INCREASE THAT THE CD EYES

00:24:51.423 --> 00:24:54.092
METHODOLOGY. WOULD JUSTIFY WAS

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:55.460
TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT. THE

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:56.561
AVERAGE RATE INCREASE ACTUALLY

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:57.996
SOUGHT BY INSURERS WAS SIX

00:24:58.063 --> 00:25:00.732
POINT 3% THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.968
WHY WOULDN'T AN INSURER SEEK A

00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:04.102
LARGER RATE APPROVAL EVEN IF

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:05.704
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:06.204
ON RULES WOULD SAY IT'S

00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:08.440
JUSTIFIED. THE ANSWER IS THAT

00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:09.975
UNDER STATE LAW. A PUBLIC

00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:11.543
INTERVENOR GROUP CAN DEMAND AND

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.112
RECEIVE A PUBLIC HEARING. ON

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:15.647
ANY RATE FILING THE 7% OR MORE.

00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:17.649
THESE PUBLIC HEARINGS INVOLVE

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:18.049
THE APPOINTMENT OF

00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:20.151
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. AND

00:25:20.218 --> 00:25:21.753
ON AVERAGE THE PROCESSING TIME

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.722
IS FOURTEEN MONTHS. INSTEAD OF

00:25:23.788 --> 00:25:26.191
THE FIVE MONTHS THAT SLIDE FOUR

00:25:26.258 --> 00:25:26.725
INDICATES THIS THE NORMAL

00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:28.994
PROCESSING TIME. OVER TIME HAS

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.062
BECOME COMMONPLACE FOR INSURERS

00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:35.066
TO FILE SIX POINT 9% OR LESS.

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:37.068
THIS SYSTEM THEN OBVIOUSLY HAS

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:38.870
AN OBVIOUS DOWNSIDE IF

00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:40.338
INSURANCE CANNOT GET TO RATE

00:25:40.405 --> 00:25:42.440
ADEQUACY QUICKLY BUT IT WILL

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:43.942
TAKE LONGER FOR AN INSURER TO

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:44.776
BE FULLY OPEN FOR NEW AND

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:46.711
RENEWAL BUSINESS A SYSTEM THAT

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:48.246
ALLOWS AN INSURER TO SAFELY AND

00:25:48.313 --> 00:25:50.348
QUICKLY ACHIEVE RATE ADEQUACY.

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:51.316
WILL BENEFIT THE PUBLIC

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:53.118
IMMENSELY INSTEAD OF THE

00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:54.853
CURRENT SYSTEM THE FORCES TOO

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.787
MANY RESIDENTS IN HIGH RISK

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:58.390
AREAS INTO THE FAIR PLAN. FOR

00:25:58.456 --> 00:25:59.691
THE NON ADMITTED MARKET. WHILE

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:01.192
THE VOLUNTARY MARKET PRICING

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:02.861
SLOWLY A JESS TO THE RISK OF

00:26:02.928 --> 00:26:05.130
THE NEW NORMAL. ANECDOTAL

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:06.364
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE CD

00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:07.966
ICE PROCESSING TIME IS STARTING

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:10.468
TO SLOW. ONLY DUE TO THEIR

00:26:10.535 --> 00:26:12.037
LARGE WORKLOAD BUT ALSO AN

00:26:12.103 --> 00:26:13.405
EMERGENCY THE AYE PRACTICE OF

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:14.639
WITHHOLDING APPROVALS OF

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:16.708
UNDISPUTED RATE INCREASES UNTIL

00:26:16.775 --> 00:26:17.943
THE INSURER AGREES TO REDUCE

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:21.079
ITS NON RENEWALS OR AGREE TO

00:26:21.146 --> 00:26:23.014
OTHER NON RATING ISSUES. EACH

00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.950
ADDITIONAL CASE A FURTHER DELAY

00:26:25.016 --> 00:26:26.351
FOR THE REDUCES THE ABILITY OF

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:27.519
AN INSURER TO COMMENCE

00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:31.056
COMPETITION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:31.823
COLLABORATING WITH THE

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.192
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:34.793
AND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:36.461
ON THE BEST WAY FORWARD. THIS

00:26:36.528 --> 00:26:37.762
HEARING CERTAINLY STARTS AN

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:38.763
IMPORTANT DISCUSSION

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:39.731
PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO

00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:41.566
WHAT ROLE CATASTROPHE MODELS

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:43.034
AND THE NET COST OF REINSURANCE

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:45.036
COULD PLAY IN RATING. AND THANK

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.905
YOU VERY MUCH I'D BE HAPPY TO

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:02.253
COMMISSIONER AND- AND- ALSO

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.121
REPRESENTED FROM THE INSURANCE

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:05.390
COMPANY. OF COURSE WE'RE HERE

00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:06.858
TO TRY TO WORK SOMETHING OUT

00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:08.393
AND I THINK THAT THE SPIRIT.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.295
BUT I'M HEARING FROM BOTH OF

00:27:10.362 --> 00:27:11.629
YOU BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT.

00:27:11.696 --> 00:27:14.899
CALIFORNIA WE OBVIOUSLY HEADS

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.968
OF DEVASTATION WITH OUR FIRES

00:27:17.035 --> 00:27:19.270
AND SO MANY FAMILIES WERE FOUND

00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:21.206
HOMELESS AND WONDERING IF THEY

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:22.674
WERE EVER GOING TO BE REBUILT

00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:24.442
OR HOMERED. OR IF THEY EVEN GET

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:27.112
PAID FOR THEIR YEARS AND YEARS

00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:28.179
OF LOYALTY WITH THE INSURANCE

00:27:28.246 --> 00:27:29.914
COMPANY. AND HERE COMES THE

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:32.317
FIRE AND SO THERE IT IS. BUT

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:33.718
NOW WE'RE FACED WITH

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:36.688
REBUILDING. REGROUPING AND SORT

00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:37.822
OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK

00:27:37.889 --> 00:27:40.792
TOGETHER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.460
YOU HAD MENTIONED. THE BILL

00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:44.396
MISS MARTINEZ AND AFFORDABLE.

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:45.764
TO THE YOUNG HOMEOWNER THAT

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.298
THAT SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN THERE

00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:48.400
AND PROPERTY FOR A NUMBER OF

00:27:48.466 --> 00:27:50.301
YEARS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:53.004
IS- I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:54.472
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I

00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:55.907
THINK THAT THE INSURANCE

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:57.542
COMPANY IS TRYING TO SAY. WE

00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:00.245
NEED TO RECOUP WE NEED TO. TO

00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:02.113
PERHAPS RECOUP REINVEST

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.015
WHATEVER THEY'RE GONNA DO BUT-

00:28:04.082 --> 00:28:05.683
THEY'VE GOT HONOR THESE CLAIMS

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.951
AND THAT'S GONNA OBVIOUSLY COST

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:08.086
MONEY THAT'S GONNA SET THEM

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:10.922
BACK. BUT WHAT. DID YOU HAVE AN

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:13.024
IDEA OFWHAT TO HOW WE SHOULD

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:14.993
PUSH HIS AND TO WHAT LEVEL.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.262
BECAUSE THE FAIR PLAN IS. YOU

00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:19.264
KNOW IT IS BEING. PUSHED AND

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.099
PUSHED NOW IT WE'RE GONNA BE

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:22.567
ASKING MORE MORE THE FAIR PLAN.

00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:24.936
THE COST FACTORS IMPORTANT. IN

00:28:25.003 --> 00:28:26.337
THE RATE INCREASES THAT THE

00:28:26.404 --> 00:28:27.338
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE GOING

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:29.240
TO BE LOOKING FOR. SOMETHING I

00:28:29.307 --> 00:28:30.875
WOULD THINK THAT. THE SUREST

00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:31.676
COMMISSIONER WITH VERY

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:33.778
CONCERNED ABOUT. DO YOU HAVE

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:35.480
ANY IDEA WHAT IT'LL TAKE THAT.

00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:36.848
IT MIGHT LEVEL IN BALANCE

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:38.917
THINGS OFF BECAUSE IT IS TRUE

00:28:38.983 --> 00:28:40.685
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. MUST

00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:42.287
PAY THESE CLAIMS MUST BE READY

00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:44.689
FOR THE NEXT. ISSUE OF PROBLEMS

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:46.591
WITH GOOD COULD BE STORMS COULD

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:48.293
BE FIRES COULD BE WHATEVER. SO

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:49.094
THEY'VE GOT TO BE READY

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.896
FINANCIALLY READY AND WE KNOW

00:28:51.963 --> 00:28:53.731
THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. DAY

00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:56.234
OF GOT ALSO LOOK AT THE NORMAL.

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:57.502
HOMEOWNER WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:58.837
THAT HOUSE PAYMENTS. AND

00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:01.606
MAINTAIN THAT INSURANCE SO CAN

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:02.207
YOU ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE

00:29:02.273 --> 00:29:05.543
BIT MISTER MARTINEZ. THANK YOU

SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THAT

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:10.748
QUESTION AND- THAT THAT IS A

00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:11.683
ONE OF THE LARGEST QUESTIONS

00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:13.718
TACIT IS FOR THAT BALANCE IF

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:14.819
YOU WILL OR THE QUANDARY

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:16.454
BETWEEN AVAILABILITY AND

00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:18.523
AFFORDABILITY OF IN THIS CASE

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.758
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AND- AND

00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:23.294
SO IT IN AND ONE ASPECT OF. WE

00:29:23.361 --> 00:29:27.265
HAVE. INSURERS ARE REQUESTING

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:29.234
ADDITIONAL RATE INCREASES THAT.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.670
AS PART OF THIS THE THIS VOTE.

00:29:32.737 --> 00:29:34.572
EVERY DAY AND OF THE OF THE

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:36.241
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ARE

00:29:36.307 --> 00:29:37.442
MOVING FORWARD AND AS LONG AS

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:39.611
THE FILED RATE IS NOT EXCESSIVE

00:29:39.677 --> 00:29:40.178
INADEQUATE UNFAIRLY

00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:42.313
DISCRIMINATORY THE DEPARTMENT

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.516
HAS APPROVED THAT ABOUT THAT

00:29:44.582 --> 00:29:47.785
INCREASED NOW ON THE FLIP SIDE-

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:49.053
OR WITH THAT BEING SAID IS THAT

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.221
THEN IT MEANS THE DOUBLE DIGIT

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:51.990
MEANS POTENTIALLY EVEN TRIPLE

00:29:52.056 --> 00:29:53.525
DIGIT INCREASES FROM ANY POLICY

00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:55.560
HOLDERS. AND THAT'S AS IT

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:56.961
STANDS TODAY AND THEN. GIVEN

00:29:57.028 --> 00:30:00.031
ALSO WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES

00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:01.266
OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

00:30:01.332 --> 00:30:03.568
FAILING AS WHAT YOU STATED IS

00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:06.070
WANTING TO EVEN MORE RECOUP- OF

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:07.805
COSTS IN BEING ABLE TO LEVEL

00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:09.440
IT'S SOMETHING WHERE AT LEAST

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:10.175
FROM THE COMMISSIONERS

00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:11.809
PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE'RE WANTING

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:14.212
TO FIND THAT BALANCE OF BEING

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:16.181
ABLE TO ENSURE THAT UNDER PROP

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:17.182
ONE OF THREE READ THE

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:28.826
THAT WE HAVE A- A HEALTHY AND

00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:31.029
VIBRANT INSURANCE MARKET PLACE

00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:33.131
ESPECIALLY AND ADMITTED-

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:37.335
CARRIERS LINED SO. THE SORRY IS

EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE OUTLINED

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:45.343
OF. IT'S VERY HARD TO ACTUALLY

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.312
BEING ABLE TO MEET. THESE

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:50.215
INCREASES THAT ARE ALREADY

00:30:50.281 --> 00:30:53.585
BEING APPROVED ON THE- IT'S

00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:54.919
THAT CAR IS TO SAY IT'S THAT

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.921

THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:02.994
POLICY DISCUSSION WE ABSOLUTELY

00:31:03.061 --> 00:31:04.529
NEED TO KEEP THIS IN MIND AND

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:06.598
THERE IS THERE COULD BE THAT.

00:31:06.664 --> 00:31:09.267

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:17.842
QUESTION TOO BUT IT'S JUST LIKE

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:20.511
BUT I THINK THAT IT'S AS WE

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:21.045
MOVE FORWARD ON POTENTIAL

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:24.616
REFORMS. THAT IT ALSO IS

00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:25.183
ENSURING THE INDIVIDUALS IN

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.585
THESE. NON RENEWED AREAS CAN

00:31:27.652 --> 00:31:29.320
CONTINUE TO HAVE AVAILABLE

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:31.456
INSURANCE AT THEIR FINGERTIPS

00:31:31.522 --> 00:31:33.491
THAT'S OVER ALSO FOR FINDING IS

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:36.361
THAT. THE VERY ABILITY TO HAVE

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:38.563
INSURANCE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.365
OF INSURANCE IS THAT IS THE

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:42.734
CHALLENGE- LET ALONE EVEN BE

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.335
ABLE TO PAY IT BUT WERE NOW

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:46.104
COMING ACROSS WHERE INSURANCE

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:46.971
IS ACTUALLY NOT BEING IT BEING

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:49.274
AVAILABLE. AND SO IS AS AGAIN

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.643
AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THINKING

00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:55.546
ABOUT- REFORMS FOR THIS YEAR.

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:56.781
IN KEEPING IN MIND THE

00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:58.783
AFFORDABILITY. SO THAT AS WE

00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:59.784
MOVE FORWARD AND THE

00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:07.358
PERFORMANCE ON THE MARKET. AND

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.293
I WANTED. TO TRY COLLEGE MIGHT

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:09.894
HAVE ADDITIONAL YEAH I'LL JUST

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:12.864
ADD THAT. AS OF MISTER MARTINEZ

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.232
JUST SAID WE'RE ALREADY

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:16.367
APPROVING THE RATE INCREASES OF

00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:17.735
THE PREMIUMS OF ALREADY GONE

00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:21.205
UP. WHAT WE'RE HOPING NOW IS TO

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:22.940
BRING THOSE PREMIUMS DOWN BY

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:25.810
MITIGATING FUTURE LOSS THE ONLY

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:28.079
WAY TO BRING PREMIUMS DOWN IS

00:32:28.146 --> 00:32:30.081
TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF

00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:32.350
LOS. AND WHAT WE HOPE IS THAT

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:35.219
THEM MARKET. FULL FULL ONE

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:36.821

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:39.824
PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET

00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:42.527
THAT MITIGATION ACTION. IN IN

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:45.363
PLACE. AND YOU KNOW IT'S

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.230
ALREADY HAPPENING THROUGHOUT

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:49.033
THE STATE. UTILITIES ALREADY

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.536
REDUCING BRUSH COMMUNITIES ARE

00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:54.038
ACTING. I MEAN THIS HAS REALLY

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:57.175
SENT A MESSAGE FROM TWO

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:58.109

00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.677
TO COMMUNITIES BUT THEY ARE

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:01.713
HEARING PROBABLY IN YOUR OWN.

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:03.681
SOUNDS THAT YOU LIVE IN LIKE

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:05.083
PEOPLE GENERALLY IGNORE

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:07.318
INSURANCE BUT NOW THEY'RE VERY

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:10.188
AWARE OF THE VALUE INSURANCE-

00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:12.623
GIVEN WE'VE ALREADY. PROVIDED

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.525
THE RATE INCREASES WE HOPE

00:33:14.592 --> 00:33:15.993
INSURERS WILL STICK WITH THEIR

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.696
CONSUMERS. WELL WE GET THROUGH

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:20.765
THIS TOUGH SPACE. GET THE

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:23.501
HARDENING IN PLACE AND REDUCE

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:25.937
THE RISK OF LOTS. AND IF I MAY

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:27.505
FOLLOW UP MEDICARE. IN

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:28.506

THEY'RE MOVING THE BRUSH ASIDE

00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:40.585
THE TREASON SO ON AND OR

00:33:40.651 --> 00:33:42.920
THEY'RE ADDING- TILE ROOFS OR

00:33:42.987 --> 00:33:44.756
WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING. TO

00:33:44.822 --> 00:33:47.792
PREVENT LOSS OF THEIR PROPERTY

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:49.927
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FIND OUT

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:52.263
WHO'S DOING IT WHO'S NOT BRING

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.364
THOSE RATES BACK DOWN TO MAKE

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:54.432
THOSE ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:55.800
NECESSARY THAT I'M HOPING THAT

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:57.602

DIFFICULT MAN HAS TO BE PART OF

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.972
THE APPROACH MOVING FORWARD

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:02.707
WE'VE CERTAINLY EMBRACE.

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:05.443
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. WHAT IS

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.545

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:11.282
DISCOUNT. RELATED TO. TO

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:13.284
MITIGATION UNFORTUNATELY I

00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:15.153
DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN SHOW YOU

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:18.156
A DATA SET RIGHT NOW. THAT CAN

00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:19.490
QUANTIFY THAT ANY MEASURABLE

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:21.492
DEGREE I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:22.660
SHOW YOU WHAT WOULD HAVE

00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:24.061
STOPPED THE FIRE FROM

00:34:24.128 --> 00:34:25.696
OVERRUNNING PARADISE. YOU KNOW

00:34:25.763 --> 00:34:27.598
AT SOME POINT. I MEAN WE WERE

00:34:27.665 --> 00:34:29.133
ACTIVE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.501
FOR THE BUILDING CODE UPGRADE

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.603
WITH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.771
CERTAINLY WERE PART OF THE

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:35.907
CHORUS OF VOICES SAYING WELL WE

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:37.708
OUGHT TO HAVE. SCREENS OVER

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:39.377
OUR- VENTS AND WE OUGHT TO HAVE

00:34:39.444 --> 00:34:40.645
COVERED EVE'S AND YOU KNOW LET

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.113
LET'S REALLY LOOK AT WHAT CAN

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.282
WE DO TO- TO ENCOURAGE

00:34:44.348 --> 00:34:45.750
DEFENSIBLE SPACE. BUT AS OF

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:46.918
THIS POINT I DON'T THINK ANYONE

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:49.153
CAN TELL YOU WITHOUT EVEN A LOW

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.455
DEGREE OF CERTAINTY MUCH LESS A

00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:51.989
HIGH DEGREE OF CERTAINTY HOW

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:52.523
INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS AT THE

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.725
PERSONAL LEVEL. OR COMMUNITY

00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:56.527
WIDE MITIGATION EFFORTS CAN

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:58.696
LEAD TO A SPECIFIED REDUCTION

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:01.532
IN THE RISK OF A LOSS. IN THE

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.267
FOUNTAIN GROVE AREA I WAS A

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:05.436
FIREPLACE COMMUNITY AND THEY

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:07.038
HAD FOR BOARD MEMBERS ON THEIR

00:35:07.104 --> 00:35:09.373
FIRE WISE BOARD THAT LOST THEIR

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.775
HOMES. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:12.577
DONE A WONDERFUL JOB. SO THE

00:35:12.643 --> 00:35:14.679
NOTION THAT THERE'S AN EASY FIX

00:35:14.745 --> 00:35:15.780
THAT SOMEONE ON THEIR OWN

00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:17.315
PROPERTY US OR A SMALL

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:19.250
COMMUNITY. CAN INSTANTLY JUST

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:20.852
SAY WELL WE'VE DONE SOME

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:22.420
MEDICATION EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:23.955
I'M WE CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:26.190
THAT'S RIGHT. NOW WE CERTAINLY

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:28.125
BELIEVE THAT WERE MULTIPLE-

00:35:28.192 --> 00:35:29.260
YEARS AHEAD OF US OF

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:30.595
RESEARCHING THIS AND WE'RE

00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:31.762
CERTAINLY TRYING TO ADVANCE THE

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:33.264
SCIENCE AS MUCH AS EVERYONE WE

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:34.932
CERTAINLY. SUPPORTED

00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:36.534
ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN SPELL

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:39.504
LAST YEAR FOCUSED ON. ADVANCING

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:42.273
THE SCIENCE AS WELL. ULTIMATELY

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.242
IN THE SHORT TERM WE HAVE AN

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:47.345
IMBALANCE THAT. THAT IN THE

00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:49.013
SLIDES A I THINK IT PRESENTS IT

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.781
VERY QUICKLY WE CERTAINLY DON'T

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.583
THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE A

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.186
COMPANY GETS A SIX POINT

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:55.720
SOMETHING PERCENT INCREASE

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:58.189
EVERYTHING'S GOOD. AND WE HAVE

00:35:58.256 --> 00:35:59.423
A SYSTEM THAT JUST IS

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.125
UNFORTUNATELY TAKING A LONG

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:04.729
TIME. TO HAVE A PRICE INCREASES

00:36:04.795 --> 00:36:06.964
MOVE THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND- IF

00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:08.399
THAT'S THE POLICY DECISION OF

00:36:08.466 --> 00:36:09.200
THE STATE THERE'S AN OBVIOUS

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:10.535
CONSEQUENCE FOR IT WHICH IS

00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:11.969
RESTRICTION OF AVAILABILITY AND

00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:13.504
THEN WHAT DOES THAT LEAVE THE

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:14.639
AVERAGE HOMEOWNER IN THE

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:15.606
HIGHEST RISK COMMUNITIES WERE

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.174
ABANDONING THEM AND SAYING THE

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:18.209
ONLY SOLUTION WE'RE GONNA GIVE

00:36:18.276 --> 00:36:20.811
YOU. IS THE FAIR PLAN WHICH WE

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:22.880
KNOW IS WAY MORE EXPENSIVE IT

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:24.248
HAS TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE AND

00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:25.416
IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE A

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:27.485
PERMANENT. SOLUTION SO THERE

00:36:27.552 --> 00:36:29.153
HAS TO BE A SOLUTION BETWEEN

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.855
FAIR PLAN PRICING AND WHERE THE

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:32.823
PRICING LEVEL IS NOW. BECAUSE

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:34.392
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE

00:36:34.458 --> 00:36:36.227
SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:38.429
A ROBUST. DEPENDABLE INSURANCE

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:39.664
PRODUCT ANY GET RID OF THE

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:40.998
ANXIETY THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:48.873
EXPERIENCING. THANK YOU VENTURE.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:59.050
THANK. AND I LEARNED ABOUT

00:36:59.116 --> 00:37:01.452
TSUNAMIS. SO I THOUGHT I BETTER

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:02.920
NOT BY HOUSE ON THE PENINSULA

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:04.889
IN ORANGE COUNTY AND THEN-

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:07.525
ENJOYING- BACKPACKING IN THE

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:08.826
CLEVELAND NATIONAL FOREST I

00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:09.727
THOUGHT OH MY GOODNESS OF I

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:10.962
BOUGHT A PLACE UP IN MAJESTIC

00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:12.229
CANYON A THEY HAVE TO WORRY

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:15.166
ABOUT BUYERS SO. I DECIDE TO

00:37:15.232 --> 00:37:17.268
BUY A HOUSE ON THE FLOOD PLAIN.

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:19.770
YEAH THIS PROCESS THE SEVEN

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:21.639
OAKS THEM BOTH EVERYTHING. I

00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:23.774
GATHER SO THERE IS SOME RISK TO

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:26.444
WHEREVER YOU CHOOSE TO OWN A

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:29.113
HOME IN. IT SEEMS TO ME A FEW

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.548
DECADES AGO THEY DID HAVE A

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:31.849
PRETTY THOROUGH STUDY OF

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:34.151
WILDFIRES IN. IN THE CONCLUSION

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:36.420
THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTORS

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:39.590
WERE SHAKE ROOFS. AND SO CHANGE

00:37:39.657 --> 00:37:42.293
AND WE DON'T BUILD BUT SHAKE

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.196
ROOFS AND IN WHAT AREAS SO I'M

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:47.198
JUST CURIOUS WHAT MISTER MARK.

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:50.668
LEARN FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS

00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:52.503
THE- HERE WE CAN MAKE A

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.006
SIGNIFICANT MITIGATING

00:37:55.072 --> 00:37:56.941
IMPROVEMENTS- MISTER FRAZIER

00:37:57.008 --> 00:38:00.244
MENTIONED. GREENS AND SOME

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:04.081
OTHER IDEAS BUT. WHAT TAKE

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:04.682
AWAYS DO WE HAVE WHAT WE LEARN

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:12.189
IN. ALL THIS DRESS THAT BRIEFLY

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:14.859
THE THERE ARE MANY SO MANY

00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:16.794
CURRENT STUDIES GOING ON BY

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.863
BOTH THE INDUSTRY AND OUR

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:21.399
LOCAL. FIRE DEPARTMENTS WESTERN

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:23.467
FIRE CHIEFS. ALL KINDS OF

00:38:23.534 --> 00:38:24.268
GROUPS THAT ARE GETTING

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:26.871
TOGETHER AND LOOKING AT

00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:28.572
EFFECTIVE MITIGATION EFFORTS-

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.841
IT DOES IT DOES GO BEYOND THE

00:38:30.908 --> 00:38:31.542
SCREENS WHICH ARE VERY

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:33.711
IMPORTANT. IN IN TERMS OF THE

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:35.846
KIND OF- SHRUBBERY THAT PEOPLE

00:38:35.913 --> 00:38:41.118
HAVE IN THEIR HOMES. THE USE OF.

00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:43.187
VARIOUS WAYS OF MAKING SURE

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:46.557
THAT. YOU HAVE A PROTECTED

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:48.726
SPACE BEYOND THE OLD DEFENSIBLE

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:53.297
SPACE MAPS BUT REALLY ABOUT HOW

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:54.932
TRIBES ARE TRIMMED ALL YOUR

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.801
FENCES ATTACHED TO YOUR HOME

00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:58.402
THEY SHOULDN'T ATTACHED YOUR

00:38:58.469 --> 00:38:59.904
HOME OF THE OF A WOODEN FENCE

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.472
THERE ARE JUST MANY LITTLE

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.974
DETAILS. OF THINGS THAT WE DO

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:06.310
NOW WE USE A WOODEN BALLS WOULD

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:08.379
WOOD MULCH WHICH THE FIRE

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:10.147
CHIEFS ARE SAYING LIKE THROWING

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:11.716
LITTLE MATCHES OUT IN FRONT OF

00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:14.585
YOUR HOUSE. THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:18.255
IMPACTS THAT WE COULD MAKE THAT.

00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:20.558
EVEN FIRE WISE COMMUNITIES OF

00:39:20.624 --> 00:39:22.660
JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO HAD NOT

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:24.628
TAKEN NO STEPS THEY HAD.

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:26.564
FOLLOWED SOME OF THE THINGS IN

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.532
PLACE AT THE TIME. BUT WE

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:30.334
REALLY NEED NEW BUILDING CODE

00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:33.537
REQUIREMENTS. THE ABILITY TO

00:39:33.604 --> 00:39:35.039
HAVE MORE SPACE BETWEEN

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:37.374
STRUCTURES. SO PART OF IT IS

00:39:37.441 --> 00:39:38.876
ABOUT MOVING FORWARD AND NEW

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:40.745
CONSTRUCTION. AND THEN THERE

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:42.980
ARE A WHOLE SET OF RULES ABOUT

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:46.016
THINGS WE DID BEFORE. NINETEEN

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:48.119
SIXTIES VERY POPULAR TO PUT. IT

00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:51.222
PINE TREES IN CYPRUS PUSHES THE

00:39:51.288 --> 00:39:53.190
WORST HANDLES THAT WE COULD

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:55.126
HAVE NEXT DOOR HOMES. OTHER LOT

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:57.528
OF THINGS WE CAN DO. AND A LOT

00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:58.529
OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO THAT

00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:00.231
ARE NEW OR NEW CONSTRUCTION

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:02.800
MOVING FORWARD. THAT OF BOTH

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:07.605
THE- BE A SAFETY STUDIES DONE

00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:09.707
BY THE INDUSTRY. A BACK IN

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:11.609
THERE'S CENTER BACK IN- SOUTH

00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:15.279
CAROLINA IN. CHS WHAT IS IT AB

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:17.281
EIGHT I VHS AS WELL AS WESTERN

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:20.551
FIRE CHIEFS LOCAL FIRED. CAL

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:22.620
FIRE THEY ALL ARE COMING

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:23.354
TOGETHER WITH THE

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.389
RECOMMENDATIONS F THINGS THAT

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:27.224
ARE QUITE EFFECTIVE TO DO. WHEN

00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:29.794
CAN WE EXPECT TO GET THAT

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.595
REPORTER THAT STUDY. WELL MY

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:34.698
TOWN HAD A MEETING LAST WEEK TO

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:36.534
TALK ABOUT CHANGING OUR

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.303
BUILDING REQUIREMENTS SO. IT IS

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.273
IT DOES GO DOWN TO COMMUNITY BY

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:44.742
COMMUNITY DECISION MAKING. FOR

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:45.910
MOST OF THE CODES THERE ARE

00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:47.945
STATE BUILDING CODES THAT WILL

00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:50.314
LIKELY CHANGE GOING FORWARD BUT

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:52.616
AT THIS POINT IN TIME THERE ARE

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.852
A LOT OF COMMUNITIES MOVING

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:56.854
FORWARD THEMSELVES. OF MARIN

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:58.422
COUNTY HAS IT'S OWN ACTION

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:01.125
PLANS AS A COMMISSIONER LARA

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:02.159
GOES OUT TO EACH OF THE

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:04.562
SEPARATE COUNTIES WE ARE

00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:06.630
MEETING WITH COUNTY SUPERVISORS

00:41:06.697 --> 00:41:08.933
AND STATE LEGISLATORS AND

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.034
HEARING IN EACH OF THESE

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.469
COUNTIES. THAT IS GENERATING

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:15.573
THEIR OWN ON A MOVEMENT FORWARD

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:17.842
TO DEAL WITH MEDICATION. BUT

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.143
ONE OF THE THINGS ARE LOOKING

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.110
FOR IS A LITTLE MORE

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:22.513
STANDARDIZATION SO THAT THEY

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.547
KNOW THAT THE EFFORTS THEY

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:25.349
MAKE. WILL BE THE ONES THAT

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.051
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN GET

00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:27.551
KEEPING THEIR INSURANCE

00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:30.087
COVERAGE. SINCE I'VE CENTER IF

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:34.391
I COULD OF JUNE OR JUST A- JUST

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:35.759
A JUST OUT I'D BE REMISS ALSO

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:38.596
IF- ONE PARTICULAR PART PROGRAM

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:39.196

COVERAGE AND WITH THAT BECAUSE

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.569
OF THIS PROGRAM. THERE ARE MANY

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:54.738
PARTNERS IN THE ADMITTED

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.941

SOMETHING WHERE. OF WE BELIEVE

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:23.934
A AND A- Mà THAT HAS ALREADY

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:25.436
IN EXISTENCE TODAY IN

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:27.738
PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY.

00:43:27.805 --> 00:43:28.806
CENTER IF I MAY ADD TO THAT IT

00:43:28.872 --> 00:43:31.241
IS A PARTNERSHIP PREDOMINATELY

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:32.109
BETWEEN LOCAL THE LOCAL

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:33.544
GOVERNMENT THERE THE COUNTY IS

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:34.712
PUT IN A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:36.046
AMOUNT OF MONEY TO FACILITATE

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:37.514
THE INSPECTION AND VERIFICATION

00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:38.882
PROCESS THAT IS A VOLUNTARY

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:41.418
PROGRAM IN COLORADO. ON SLIDE

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:43.954
ONE WE DID INCLUDE A COMPARISON

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:45.556
TO COLORADO BECAUSE WE ASSUME

00:43:45.622 --> 00:43:47.191
THIS WOULD COME UP. IT'S

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:48.225
IMPORTANT TO SEE THAT THE

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:50.561
AVERAGE PREMIUM IN COLORADO IS

00:43:50.627 --> 00:43:56.500
50% HIGHER. THEN IN CALIFORNIA.

00:43:56.567 --> 00:43:59.970
SO I'M WE CAN TALK ABOUT THINGS

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:02.039
THAT ARE MITIGATION RELATED AND

00:44:02.106 --> 00:44:03.273
WE SHOULD AND WE'RE ATTEMPTING

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.641
TO PUSH THE SCIENCE AS QUICKLY

00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:06.443
AS ANYONE ELSE'S AND THERE'S

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.311
MANY INVOLVED IN THAT THE

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:09.380
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH NEST

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:11.982
IS VERY ACTIVE AS WELL INDUSTRY

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:14.651
AS A LEADING AGENT FOR THIS

00:44:14.718 --> 00:44:16.920
RESEARCH THROUGH AYE BHS WE

00:44:16.987 --> 00:44:18.155
CARE DEEPLY ABOUT GETTING TO

00:44:18.222 --> 00:44:19.356
THE ROOT OF WHAT CAN WE DO

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:21.325
THAT'S WITHIN OUR CONTROL TO

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:22.693
MITIGATE LOSSES AND HOPEFULLY

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.461
DECELERATE THE RATE OF

00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:28.098
INFLATION. OF PRICING. BUT WE

00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:30.200
SHOULDN'T IGNORE OTHER RELEVANT

00:44:30.267 --> 00:44:33.470
DATA SUCH IS THE DISPARATE.

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:35.973
INSURANCE PRICING. EVEN IN A

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.175
PLACE LIKE COLORADO WHERE THERE

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:39.543
ARE I CERTAINLY LESS THAN FIVE

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.278
INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT HAVE

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:42.613
BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THAT PROGRAM.

00:44:42.679 --> 00:44:47.084
WORK WORK FOR THEM. I'M. SO

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:47.718
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK AHEAD BUT

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:50.921
I SO FAR LOOK AT THIS WHAT

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:53.090
HAPPENED IN FLORIDA AND AFTER

00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:53.624
NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN A

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:54.992
HURRICANE BANKRUPTED ELEVEN

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:56.593
INSURANCE COMPANIES WELL IT

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.496
KICKED OFF A MASSIVE INVESTMENT

00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:01.732
IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT CAN WE DO

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:04.101
WHAT'S WITHIN OUR CONTROL TO

00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:05.269
REDUCE THE RISK OF LOSS RELATED

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:07.638
TO WIND THEN AFTER BOTH LOMA

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:09.907
PRIETA AND THEN THE NORTHRIDGE

00:45:09.973 --> 00:45:11.708
QUAKE AND WE HAD A SUBSTANTIAL

00:45:11.775 --> 00:45:12.843
MARKET DISRUPTION IN HOMEOWNERS

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.445
INSURANCE IN NINETEEN NINETY

00:45:14.511 --> 00:45:15.913
FIVE AND NINETEEN NINETY SIX

00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:16.947
THE CULMINATED IN THE CREATION

00:45:17.014 --> 00:45:19.049
OF THE CA. THAT KICKED OFF AN

00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:20.851
ENORMOUS EFFORT WE UNDERSTAND

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:23.487
WHAT'S WITHIN OUR CONTROL FOR

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:24.988
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS AND THEN

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:25.522
ULTIMATELY NOW WE HAVE THE

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:27.825
BASEBALL PROGRAM THROUGH THE CA

00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:29.193
AND WE'RE AT THE BEGINNING OF

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:31.361
THAT PROCESS NOW FIRE BECAUSE

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:34.798
WE WANT TO FEEL IN CONTROL WE

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:36.233
WANT TO SAY IF I DO X. Y. Z. TO

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.001
MY HOUSE FOUR OF MY COMMUNITY

00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:39.870
THIS OF WITH A GOLF COURSE THAT

00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:43.640
LIMITS WILL THAT HELP US. AND

00:45:43.707 --> 00:45:44.174
WE HAVE TWO A DAY SCIENCE

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:45.609
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE SIMPLY NOT

00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:47.144
THE CASE OF SAYING YOU DO THIS

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:49.146
YOU REDUCE THE RISK OF LOSS BY

00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:51.748
THAT THAT SCIENCE TO SIMPLY

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:53.016
DOES NOT EXIST AT THIS POINT

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:54.985
BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD I WANNA

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:56.353
STRESSED OUT WE WERE ON THIS

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:02.860
TOPIC THIS CALLER I DON'T ALLOW.

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.728
AND TO BE. A THE RATE IN

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:06.363
PROCESS. I WAS LOOKING BACK THE

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.999
REINSURANCE CáC. I THINK IT'S

00:46:09.066 --> 00:46:10.467
THE IS FOR EIGHT OTHER STATES

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:11.835
THAT MY UNDERSTANDING FORTY

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:12.369
EIGHT OTHER STATES THAT DO

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:16.306
ALLOW REINSURANCE AND THERE AND

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:16.874
I BELIEVE COLORADO IS ON ITS

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.309
IT'S- GHETTO. ALLOW SCOTT

00:46:19.376 --> 00:46:21.979
WASHINGTON. CALIFORNIA THE ONLY

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.280
THREE THAT DON'T ALLOW FOR

00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:24.181
THAT'S ON WONDERING IF I'M

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:26.016
WRONG THAT COLORADO ALLOWS OUR

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:28.719
INSURANCE IT WAS WOULD LIKELY

00:46:28.785 --> 00:46:30.554
WILL WILL WILL CONFIRM THAT

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:32.289
AND- YAH YEAH WILL FOLLOW UP

00:46:32.356 --> 00:46:33.790
AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IT ALSO

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:35.058
CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT IF THEY

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:38.529
DID ALLOW THE REINSURANCE WITH

00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:39.396
THAT MAKE IT MORE TOLERABLE TO.

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:40.697
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE

00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:42.766
COVERAGE I IN STE IN STATES

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:44.301
WITH PRICING FLEXIBILITY WHERE

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:46.937
THERE'S NOT SUCH A- A LARGE

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:48.238
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RISK AND

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:49.306
PRICE YOU DON'T SEE THESE TYPE

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:52.376
OF AVAILABILITY ISSUES FOR SURE.

00:46:52.442 --> 00:46:53.777
IN YEAH JUST WHILE WE'RE ON THE

00:46:53.844 --> 00:46:55.045
TOPIC OF REINSURANCE YOU KNOW

00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:56.847
THE AIRPLANE RATES TO INCLUDE

00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:58.715
THE ACTUAL COST OF REINSURANCE

00:46:58.782 --> 00:46:59.349
THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:00.884
AUTHORITY'S RATES DO INCLUDE

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:02.519
THE ACTUAL COST OF REINSURANCE.

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:04.288
SO THIS ISN'T A FOREIGN CONCEPT

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:06.190
TO CALIFORNIA'S JUST RIGHT NOW.

00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:08.091
IF YOU'RE IN ADMITTED ENSURE IF

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:08.926
YOU'RE A VOLUNTARY MARKET

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:10.460
ENSURE THAT IS COMPELLED TO

00:47:10.527 --> 00:47:12.296
PARTICIPATE IN THE FAIR PLAN.

00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:13.730
WELL THAT PRICING DOES INCLUDE

00:47:13.797 --> 00:47:17.134
THE ACTUAL COST OF REINSURANCE-BUT SOMEHOW IF IT'S JUST YOU.

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:18.468
THEN WE TAKE A DIFFERENT

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:19.236
POSITION AND I UNDERSTAND THE

00:47:19.303 --> 00:47:21.004
DEPARTMENT'S LONG STANDING

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:22.973
IDEOLOGICAL POSITION ON FEAR OF

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.575
THINGS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:25.075
AND THAT'S WHY IN THEIR

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:26.944
REGULATIONS THEY DO PUT

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.646
PARAMETERS AROUND. A PURPOSEFUL

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:31.982
ATTEMPTS TO USE REINSURANCE TO

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:33.951
EVADE RATE REGULATION WE'RE

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:34.585
HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:36.587
CONVERSATIONS. BUT TO DATE WE

00:47:36.653 --> 00:47:38.155
JUST WE SIMPLY HAVEN'T BUT WE

00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:40.057
HOPE THAT CAN BE PART OF THE

00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:43.093
DISK. PART WITH. WHEN DOESN'T

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.428
HAVE THE COST OF INSURANCE IN

00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:46.897
HER CURRENT RATES. AND THE

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:48.832
RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE BASED

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:51.468
ON THE LOSSES EXPERIENCEDBY

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:54.905
INSURERS RATE SETTING. PROCESS

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:57.140
EVALUATES INSURER'S LOSSES. AND

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:59.509
SETS A RATE THAT WILL PAY FOR

00:47:59.576 --> 00:48:01.144
THE EXPECTED LOSSES IN THE

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:03.880
COMING YEAR. IF THE OTHER

00:48:03.947 --> 00:48:05.849
STATES ARE DOING THE SAME. AND

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:07.351
THEY HAVE HIGHER PREMIUMS IT

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:08.785
WOULD MEAN THAT THEY'RE

00:48:08.852 --> 00:48:11.922
EXPECTING MORE LOSSES. SO IF

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:13.023
YOU CLARIFY SOMETHING YOU JUST

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:13.857
SAID I'M SORRY I THOUGHT I

00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:15.325
HEARD YOU SAY THAT THE FAIR

00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:17.794
PLAN DOES NOT ALLOW IT DOESN'T

00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:19.796
INCLUDE THAT THE REINSURANCE AS

00:48:19.863 --> 00:48:21.431
PART OF RATE MAKING. IS THAT

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:23.233
ACCURATE OR PLANS CURRENT RATES

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.236
DO NOT INCLUDE A PRICE OF

00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:28.772
REASSURANCE. HE LAN HAS THE

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:30.741
ABILITY IF IT WERE TO NEED

00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:34.077
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO DO AN

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:36.246
ASSESSMENT OF THE INDUSTRY. IT

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:38.482
HAS NOT DONE AN ASSESSMENT IN

00:48:38.548 --> 00:48:40.317
DECADES IT ACTUALLY HAS DONE

00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:43.120
DISTRIBUTIONS. OF MONEY IN

00:48:43.186 --> 00:48:47.157
RECENT DECADES- BUT THEY- THE

00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:48.892
RAKES CURRENTLY DO NOT INCLUDE

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:50.961
ANY REINSURANCE COSTS. BUT CAN

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:52.963
THAT INCLUDED WHEN THEY DO THE

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.132
REASSESSMENT. THEY HAVE THE

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.867
ABILITY TO INCLUDE IT LATER ON

00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:58.702
CORRECT WITHOUT GOING TO THE

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:00.771
CITY I'M PERMITS THE TERM AN

00:49:00.837 --> 00:49:02.606
REVIEWS AND APPROVES THE

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:04.074
AIRPLANES RATES SO THAT WOULD

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:06.143
BE A DECISION BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:07.811
ON THE COMMISSIONER. OF WHETHER

00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:09.012
THE FAIR PLAN WOULD GET ME

00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:10.580
INSURANCE AND THAT'S RIGHT. IT

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:13.417
IS NOT. THE RATE MAKING ISN'T

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:15.352
SPECIFIC TO THE PROP ONE OF

00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:18.155
THREE REGULATIONS THAT. OTHER

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:20.624
INSURERS HAVE BEEN HELD TO. I'M

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:21.625
SORRY I INTERRUPTED THE PROCESS

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:23.927
OF MISTER BORDERS WHO WERE NEXT

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:24.494
YOU WANTED TO A MONTH SORRY

00:49:24.561 --> 00:49:26.129
WERE YOU DONE. YOU AND I CAN.

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:27.564
LET'S GO MISTER BURGESS AND

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:29.232
THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO USE

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:31.601
THAT OKAY MISTER BRIDGES. WORK

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:33.236
I WANT TO A THANK INSURANCE

00:49:33.303 --> 00:49:36.039
COMMISSIONER- MEASURE LOTTE

00:49:36.106 --> 00:49:38.675
CAME TO. MY DISTRICT- I

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:41.111
REPRESENT ELEVEN COUNTIES- MANY

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:43.914
OF WHICH- FIRE PRONE COUNTIES.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.550
AND IT WAS IT WAS A SHOCKING

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:49.619
EXPERIENCE HAVING A TOWN HALL.

00:49:49.686 --> 00:49:51.154
PEOPLE ARE SCARED THEY HAVE

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:53.457
EVERY RIGHT TO BE SCARED. AND

00:49:53.523 --> 00:49:57.060
NOT JUST BASED ON WHAT IS AT

00:49:57.127 --> 00:49:59.663
ISSUE RIGHT NOW PUBLIC SAFETY

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.765
BUT LONG TERM. YOU HAVE

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:05.135
CHILDREN BOB PARENTS ARE

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:06.770
WONDERING WHETHER NON TO ON

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:09.239
THEIR KIDS NEED TO BE RELOCATED

00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:10.874
TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE.

00:50:10.941 --> 00:50:12.609
AS SCHOOL FUNDING MAY GO DOWN

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.411
GIVEN POPULATION DECLINES

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:15.779
QUALITY OF LIFE SO IT'S A

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.481
COMPLETE TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT.

00:50:17.547 --> 00:50:19.182
AND I THINK YOU YOU CERTAINLY

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:20.717
APPRECIATE THAT FOR ME IT WAS

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.219
VERY MUCH A LEARNING EXPERIENCE

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:23.019
IN A PAINFUL LEARNING

00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:25.088
EXPERIENCE. ODD TO HEAR THE

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:28.225
GRIEF THAT THE- MY CONSTITUENTS

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:30.193
WERE OR GOING THROUGH. SO I

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.762
THINK THERE WAS A NUMBER OF

00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:33.563
IDEAS THAT- INSURANCE

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.665
COMMISSIONER LOT I HAD. BUT FOR

00:50:35.732 --> 00:50:37.601
THAT HE WAS GOING TO EXPLORE.

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:39.870
IN THIS LEGISLATIVE CYCLE-

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:42.773
MAYBE AT THE END OF MY QUESTION

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:43.407
YOU CAN COMMENT IF YOU'RE AWARE

00:50:43.473 --> 00:50:45.842
OF ANY. A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES

00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:48.111
THAT HE WOULD BE PROPOSING. BUT

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:49.513
YOU KIND OF CAUGHT MY

00:50:49.579 --> 00:50:53.049
ATTENTION- IS TO PRESERVE. YOU

00:50:53.116 --> 00:50:55.952
HAD TALKED ABOUT- OTHER RISK

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:58.288
PRONE AREAS OF THE STATE. NOW

00:50:58.355 --> 00:50:59.956
MY FRIEND FROM ORANGE COUNTY

00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:02.492
HAD MENTIONED. TSUNAMI PRONE

00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:04.361
AREAS EARTHQUAKE PRONE AREAS

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:06.997
FLOOD PRONE AREAS. HOW IT HAS

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:09.232
THE INDUSTRY OVER THE PERIOD OF

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:12.269
TIME ADJUSTED TO THOSE RISK

00:51:12.335 --> 00:51:15.906
PRONE AREAS TO THE LOCALIZED IS

00:51:15.972 --> 00:51:17.607
THE INDUSTRY TEND TO LOCALIZE

00:51:17.674 --> 00:51:19.776
ARE THE CALCULATION OF THE

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:22.345
THREAT IN THE PREMIUMS IN THAT

00:51:22.412 --> 00:51:24.214
AREA OR CAN IT BLEED OUT IN

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:27.050
FUNGIBLE A. B. OFFSET ELSEWHERE.

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:28.752
I'M GENERALLY THEY TRY TO DO

00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:30.620
THE FORMER IN MAKING AN

00:51:30.687 --> 00:51:31.955
INSURANCE RATE REMEMBER IT'S A

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:33.123
TWO STEP PROCESS THE FIRST

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.959
DECISION IS TO TESTIFIED TO THE

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:36.827
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WHAT IS

00:51:36.893 --> 00:51:38.428
THE AVERAGE RATE LEVELTHAT

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:40.330
YOU'RE PERMITTED TO CHART AS IF

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:41.097
YOU WERE GONNA CHARGE EVERYONE

00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:43.099
THE SAME. WHICH PEOPLE DON'T.

00:51:43.166 --> 00:51:44.134
THEN THE SECOND STEP IS TO

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:45.769
FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE UNIQUE

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:47.571
RISK CHARACTERISTICS PRESENTED

00:51:47.637 --> 00:51:49.473
BY THE PARTICULAR APPLICANT AND

00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:50.640
THAT CAN RESULT IN AN UPWARD OR

00:51:50.707 --> 00:51:53.877
DOWNWARD. IMPACT ON THE RATE

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:55.011
THAT THE OR THE PREMIUM THAT

00:51:55.078 --> 00:51:58.915
SOMEONE ELSE LEE PACE. SO MUCH

00:51:58.982 --> 00:51:59.716
OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:00.750
HERE IS THE AVERAGE RATE LEFT

00:52:00.817 --> 00:52:03.053
BEFORE YOU GET TO LOOKING AT

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:05.455
REGIONAL DISTINCTIONS BUT SO BE

00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:08.458
A CHARACTER AN INSURER PLACES

00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:10.560
ITSELF AT. RISK IF IT SIMPLY

00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:11.995
TRIES TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO AN

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:14.631
AVERAGE RATE THAT WILL LEAD TO

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:15.198
THE SO CALLED DEATH SPIRAL.

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:18.235
WHICH IS THE UNDER PRICE AREA.

00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:19.469
WHEN THEY DO THAT ON WILL JUMP

00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:20.170
ON THEM AND SO YOU YOU GUYS

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:21.338
HAVE GREAT PRICE WE'RE COMING

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:22.739
WITH YOU. AND THEN THEY'LL BE

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:26.943
OVER PRICED IN AN- OTHER AT.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:27.777
AND THEY WON'T GET THIS THERE

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:28.912
AND ULTIMATELY THEY'LL END UP

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.580
HAVING AN APPROVED RATE LEVEL

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:31.214
BUT THEY'LL BE GETTING THE RISK

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:33.850
CHARACTERISTICS. OF A MUCH MUCH

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:36.019
HIGHER RISK LEVEL. SO OF COURSE

00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:37.821
EACH COMPANY HAS TO MAKE SURE

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:39.523
THAT IT CRISIS TO RISK. AS THE

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:41.892
RISK PRESENTS ITSELF OR ELSE

00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:42.425
THEY SET THEMSELVES UP FOR

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:46.763
SOLVENCY ISSUES. THE ISSUE IN

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:47.397
SOME OF THE MOUNTAIN

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:50.100
TERRITORIES THAT- I REPRESENT

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:52.135
WHERE YOU HAD A LOT OF THE-

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:53.904
BUYERS. I THINK THE ONLY TWO

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:55.639
CARRIERS THAT EXISTED MY

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:57.440
KNOWLEDGE IS DATED THIS IS A

00:52:57.507 --> 00:52:59.409
LEASE TO. A YEAR OR MORE.

00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:00.877
LLOYDS OF LONDON I THINK YET

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:03.046
SCOTTSDALE BOTH OF WHICH ARE

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:05.549
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. AND MY

00:53:05.615 --> 00:53:07.417
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHEN.

00:53:07.484 --> 00:53:09.119
THESE ENTITIES ARE OUTSIDE DO

00:53:09.185 --> 00:53:12.889
THEY PAY IN TO THE FAIR PLAN.

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:14.658
CAN YOU CAN YOU HELP ME

00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:16.393
UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE ON HOW

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:21.498
THAT PLAYS OUT. SO THE- AN

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:24.200
INSURED ISN'T THE TO GO TO THE

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:27.137
FAIR PLAN UNLESS THEY CAN'T

00:53:27.203 --> 00:53:28.505
FIND COVERAGE IN THE ADMITTED

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:31.308
MARKET. THAT DOES. FIRST MEAN

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.710
GOING TO BE ADMITTED CARRIERS

00:53:33.777 --> 00:53:35.845
THAT WERE MOST FAMILIAR WITH

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:38.248
AND TRYING TO FIND COVERAGE.

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:40.884
AND A SURPLUS LINES CARRIER

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:41.985
CAN'T WRITE A HOMEOWNER'S

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:45.355
POLICY UNLESS THAT CAN CONSUMER

00:53:45.422 --> 00:53:48.258
CAN'T FIND COVERAGE IN THE

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:50.460
ADMITTED MARKET. PROHIBITED

00:53:50.527 --> 00:53:53.597
FROM PARTICIPATING AS A FIRST

00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:56.666
LEVEL OFFER OF COVERAGE AND

00:53:56.733 --> 00:53:59.369
PART OF THE- A SO THAT LEAVES

00:53:59.436 --> 00:54:01.171
THEM OUT OF THE COMMITMENT OF

00:54:01.237 --> 00:54:02.072
BACKING THE FAIR PLAN

00:54:02.138 --> 00:54:04.140
ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:54:04.207 --> 00:54:05.675
THEY'RE NOT AN ACTIVE

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:07.077
PARTICIPANT IN THE ADMITTED

00:54:07.143 --> 00:54:09.779
MARKET. YOUR PLAN IS THAT LAST

00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:12.082
STOP AND IT'S KIND OF THE MIGHT

00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:15.452
SEE IT AS THE- INDUSTRY'S COST

00:54:15.518 --> 00:54:17.821
BETWEEN FULLY OF GETTING THE

00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:19.389
OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE THE BEST

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:22.092
BUSINESS. THEN THEY BECOME THE

00:54:22.158 --> 00:54:24.127
BACKSTOP FOR THE BUSINESS THAT

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:26.496
THEY TURNED AWAY BECAUSE IT'S

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:27.397
TOO HIGH RISK FOR THEIR

00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:29.399
UNDERWRITING. THE NOT A MINUTE

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:31.668
MARKETS REALLY A SAFETY VALVE

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:33.336
THAT'S EXISTED FOR A LONG TIME.

00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:35.305
THE REASON THEY'RE NOT ADMITTED

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:36.406
COMPANIES THEY'RE NOT

00:54:36.473 --> 00:54:38.408
PHYSICALLY PRESENT THERE'S NO

00:54:38.475 --> 00:54:39.542
PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER THEM

00:54:39.609 --> 00:54:41.311
THEY RESIDE OUTSIDE OF THE

00:54:41.378 --> 00:54:42.612
STATE. SO THERE'S A SPECIAL

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:44.848
PROCESS HAPPEN FOR LONG ARM

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:48.151
SAID. AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:49.152
HAVE TO SET UP A SPECIAL

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:51.421
PROCESS FOR AN INTERMEDIARY WHO

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:53.823
IS PHYSICALLY PRESENT HERE TO

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:54.324
BE ABLE TO EXECUTE THAT

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:56.559
TRANSACTION. BUT IT IS THE

00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:58.328
SURPLUS LINE MARKET IS ALWAYS A

00:54:58.395 --> 00:54:59.663
SAFETY VALVE IN IT'S TYPICALLY

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:01.097
NOT USE THAT MUCH IN PERSONAL

00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:02.065
LINES IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:04.401
USED IN. AN AUTO EXCEPT FOR

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:06.036
MAYBE SORT OF EXOTIC CAR THAT

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:07.671
YOU WOULDN'T ORDINARILY BE ABLE

00:55:07.737 --> 00:55:09.939
TO FIND A CARRIER FOR. BUT IT'S

00:55:10.006 --> 00:55:11.041
TYPICALLY MORE FOR LARGER

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:12.509
COMMERCIAL RISKS YOU KNOW LET'S

00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:13.977
SAY PLACES WHERE PEOPLE GET

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:16.413
HURT A BOWLING ALLEY RIGHT THAT

00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:16.980
MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO THE NON

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:18.848
ADMITTED MARKET- BECAUSE IT'S A

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:20.116
BUNCH SLIPPERY SHOES AND

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:22.519
SLIPPERS. SLIPPERY FLOORS- AND

00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:23.920
SO THE NOT ADMITTED MARKET

00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:25.755
REALLY IS JUST SOMETHING THAT

00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:27.424
IS MEANT TO GROW DURING TIMES

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:28.892
OF MARKET DISRUPTION

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:30.593
PARTICULARLY IN AND PERSONAL

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.095
LINES MARKET LKE HOMEOWNERS

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:33.797
IT'S RELATIVELY LOW I WANNA SAY

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:36.132
MAYBE AT ANY ONE TIME ONE

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:39.502
PERCENT. OF MARKET. IN YOU KNOW

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:40.403
DIRT TIMES LIKE THIS IT COULD

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:41.705
GO. BUT BECOME QUE GAINS. AT

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:43.873

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:27.056
MARTINEZ MENTION WE HEAR FROM

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:30.192
REALTORS THAT SAY THEY'VE HAD.

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:31.860
SALES FALL THROUGH BECAUSE

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:34.129
PERSON GETS A BIT ON THE WHAT

01:10:34.196 --> 01:10:35.731
THEIR INSURANCE WILL BE FINE

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:37.700
CELLS CAN BE TOO HIGH AND THEN

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:38.801
SAYS NO I DON'T WANT TO BUY

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:39.868
THIS PROPERTY I'M GONNA LOOK

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:41.837
SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO THE THESE

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.272
ARE THE SAME ISSUES AS THE

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:45.007
SENATOR MENTIONED THAT WE'RE

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:49.345
HEARING. PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.814
WE GO. AND I HAVE A QUESTION

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.015

JUST WANT HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:58.621
WORKING AND IS THERE. LOOPHOLES

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:00.623
THAT YOU'RE FINING WHERE PEOPLE

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:04.793
ARE NOT BEING INSURED. I WOULD

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.795
SAY YES THEY MENTIONED OF

01:11:06.862 --> 01:11:08.397
COURSE THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:09.898
OF PRESSING THE PAUSE BUTTON

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:13.035
AND- I MEAN I'D SAY WITH WITH

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:16.005
ANYTHING- IT WAS IT WAS

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:16.939
OBVIOUSLY BRAND THERE IS

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:18.474
SOMETHING THAT WE JUST RECENTLY

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.909
HAD IMPLEMENTED- AND NOW

01:11:20.976 --> 01:11:22.177
CURRENTLY OVER ONE MILLION

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:23.812
HOMEOWNERS AND A HUNDRED AND

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:24.380
SEVENTY SIX THE CODES WOULD

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:26.081
SAY. I WOULD SAY ALL IN ALL

01:11:26.148 --> 01:11:29.685
THAT IT HAS BEEN GOING WELL IN

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:31.654
SO FAR OF THAT- IT WE BELIEVE

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.822
INSURERS HAVE BEEN COMPLIANT

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:36.592
WITH WITH WITH THE MANDATORY

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:40.362
ASPECT. OF NO NON RENEWAL FOR

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:41.530
THAT FOR THIS ENTIRE YEAR I

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:42.765
MEAN THAT'S AGAIN AS OF UP TO

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:44.833
THE STATE SO. ALL IN ALL THAT

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.169
WE BELIEVE THAT- WE'VE BEEN IN

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:49.204
COMMUNICATION WITH INDUSTRY OF

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:51.473
THE- AND ON THIS THE MANDATORY

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.941
MORATORIUM AND SO

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:54.543
IMPLEMENTATION. AGAIN IS FOR

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:56.178
THE FIRST TIME I'VE OF COURSE

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:59.214
AS WE MOVE FORWARD- INTERESTED

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:00.516
TO HEAR IF THERE'S BEEN ANY-

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:04.486
CONCERNS ON WITH IT WITH. THE

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:06.588
HOMEOWNERS AND WITH- INDUSTRY

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:08.957
AS TO- WAYS AND TO IMPROVE

01:12:09.024 --> 01:12:10.826
IMPLEMENTATION WE BELIEVE ALL

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.895
AND ALL THAT IT HAS BEEN. IT

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:14.563
HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.665
FOR SHARING- AND I HAVE A

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:18.534
ANOTHER QUESTION- FOR YOU BUT-

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.135
THIS PERTAINS TO JOE SOMETHING

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:22.071
YOU SAID EARLIER YOU SAID JOB

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:22.871
FOR ALREADY HAVING A VERY

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:25.207
DIFFICULT TIME BEING ABLE TO

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:27.142
FOR THE FAIR PLAN AND DIAL. AND

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:28.444
I KNOW THEY GET HOW HAVE A

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:30.179
LAWSUIT GOING ON SO AS MUCH AS

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:32.381
YOU CAN SHARE- MY CONCERN HAD

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:35.017
BEEN THE HOT- MANDATING MORE

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:37.052
COVERAGE FROM THE FAIR PLAN.

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:38.754
DOES NOT CONCERN THE DEPARTMENT

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:39.855
THAT DID CAN COME EVEN MORE

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:43.258
EXPENSIVE AND MORE AFFORDABLE.

01:12:43.325 --> 01:12:45.961
CAN YOU SHARE. IT IS CERTAINLY.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.463
SO IT'S A LITTLE A LITTLE

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:52.201
COMPLICATED BUT BASICALLY THE.

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:53.869
OBLIGATED BY A HOMEOWNER'S

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:55.671
POLICY FROM THE FAIR PLAN THEY

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:58.574
STILL HAVE THE OPTION OF BUYING

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.776
A FIRE POLICY WHICH WOULD BE.

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:03.112
CHEAPER POSSIBLY. BUT THE OTHER

01:13:03.178 --> 01:13:05.781
ISSUE IS MOST CONSUMERS WANT TO

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:07.916
HAVE MORE THAN JUST A FIRE

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:09.818
COVERAGE SO WHAT THEY'RE HAVING

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:12.221
TO DO IS BUY A FIRE POLICY FROM

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:14.022
THE FAIR PLAN. AND THEN THE

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:15.891
DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICY

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.559
FROM A ONE OF THE ADMITTED

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:19.728
INSURERS. THEY'RE PAYING THE

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:21.530
EXPENSE LOADING ON THAT

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:24.099
DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICY

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.502
WITH THE ADMITTED STUDENTS FOR

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:27.035
THEIR PLAYING THE EXPENSE

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:29.071
LOADING ON THE- FIRE POLICY

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:31.039
WITH THE FAIR PLAN. OTHER THAN

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:34.109
A DOUBLE PAYING FOR A BIG PIECE

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:38.413
OF. OF EXPENSES IT REALLY ISN'T

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.616
HELPING THEM. HAVE MORE

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:44.820
COVERAGE. HE SINGLE HAVING THE

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:47.489
ABILITY TO BUY A SINGLE POLICY

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.258
GETS RID OF THE DOUBLE EXPENSE

01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:51.093
LOADING AND IT WOULD JUST BE AN

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.961
OPTION THEY COULD THEY STILL

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:53.729
HAVE THE OPTION TO GO THE FIRE

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:55.597
POLICY. THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:57.499
HE OTHER VERY IMPORTANT

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:59.535
COVERAGES BUT COULD ONLY AFFORD

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:01.203
THE FIRE POLICY THE COULD TO

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.005
SET. I HAVE A QUESTION TO

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:04.807
IRAQ'S I ALSO HEARD YOU SAY

01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:06.041
EARLIER THAT ARE YOU THINK A

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.843
LONG TERM SOLUTION IS RESTORING

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:10.212
THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. WITHOUT

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.147
DISRUPT WHAT YOU PERCEIVED TO

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:14.616
BE A SOLUTION HOW LONG TERM

01:14:14.683 --> 01:14:16.018
SOLUTION WELL CERTAINLY IT'S

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:17.619
NOT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION AND

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.021
I THINK IT IN EVEN MY PREPARED

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:20.823
REMARKS I MENTIONED THAT THE

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:22.925
FAIR PLAN IS NEVER A LONG TERM.

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:24.793
SOLUTION NOW THE ASSERTION THAT

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.495
THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT IT HAS

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:27.963
MADE THAT SOMEHOW THERE'S THIS

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:29.832
SAVINGS BECAUSE OF ELIMINATION

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:31.099
OF DUAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:32.367
THEY'VE NOT ONCE PRODUCE ANY

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:34.102
NUMBERS TO BACK THAT UP AND- IN

01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:35.370
FACT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:36.205
RELATED TO DIFFERENCE IN

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:37.606
CONDITIONS POLICIES ARE

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:38.640
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT.

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.175
DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN THE

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:41.310
ADMINISTRATIVE COTS OF THE

01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:42.511
FAIR PLAN SIMPLY BECAUSE THESE

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:43.712
ARE GIGANTIC INSURANCE

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:45.047
COMPANIES TO HAVE AFICIONADO

01:14:45.113 --> 01:14:47.716
ATION SO. WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD%

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:48.750
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:51.954
IS ANALYSIS OF. OF HOW AN H. O.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:54.089
THREE POLICY WOULD ACTUALLY BE

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:55.390
FOR THROUGH THE FAIR PLAN.

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:56.425
WOULD ACTUALLY BE CHEAPER THAN

01:14:56.491 --> 01:14:58.760
THE FAIR PLAN PLUS A D. I SEE

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:00.596
BELIEVE THIS. SO WE LOOK

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:01.496
FORWARD TO THAT ANALYSIS I

01:15:01.563 --> 01:15:03.498
BELIEVE THE FAIR PLAN HAS ELISE

01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:05.534
COMMENCED THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:06.668
BUT I DON'T. REPRESENT THEM SO

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:08.337
THEY'LL THEY'LL I'M SURE BE

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:09.771
INTERESTED TO LET YOU KNOW

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:11.740
THEIR ANALYSIS BUT- WE

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:13.175
CERTAINLY DON'T SEE THAT THE

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:14.376
NOTION THAT SOMEHOW THERE'S

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:15.744
NATURE THREE FAIR PLAN THAT'S

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:17.246
GOING TO BE LESS EXPENSIVE.

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:19.948
THAN THE EXISTING WIDELY

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:21.650
AVAILABLE THE ICY POLICIES.

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:24.419
WHEN I SAY THE SOLUTION IS TO

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:26.788
RESTORE THE VOLUNTARY MARKET.

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:28.590
WELL THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:30.125
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:30.859
CALIFORNIA IS A THOUSAND

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:33.161
DOLLARS A YEAR. AND A FAIR PLAN

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.530
POLICY WOULD SAY LET'S BE

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:36.098
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:37.666
JUST FOR FIRE ONLY RIGHT NOT

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:41.904
EVEN THE FULL H. A THREE POLICY.

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:42.838
I'LL WE NOT BE FOCUS ON MAKING

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:43.472
SURE THE VIOLIN. MARK EVEN IF

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:46.975
IT GOES UP. AND 15% EVEN IF WE

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.043
WOULD GO UP TO THE NATIONAL

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:49.778
AVERAGE WHICH WOULD BE 17%

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:51.613
WHICH IS WE'RE PRESENTLY 17%

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.148
BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE COST

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:54.650
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE A HIGH COST

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:57.219
RECONSTRUCTION STATE. THE

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.453
ABILITY OF THE ADMITTED MARKET

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.688
TO COME BACK WITH A LEVEL OF

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:01.256
RATE ADEQUACY YOU EVEN AT

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:03.091
HIGHER THAN IT IS NOW IS STILL

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:05.060
DRAMATICALLY NOT EVEN CLOSE.

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:06.728
BETTER THAN RELYING UPON THE

01:16:06.795 --> 01:16:08.397
FAIR PLAN WHY ARE WE ALLOWING

01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:09.865
PEOPLE TO HAVE NO ADMITTED

01:16:09.932 --> 01:16:11.099
MARKET OPTION IN THEIR

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:12.234
COMMUNITIES AND JUST SAYING

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.702
WELL. GO AHEAD AND GO TO THE

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:14.703
FAIR PLAN THAT'S THE WORST

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.071
THING WE CAN DO FOR THEM THE

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.539
BEST THING WE CAN DO IS TO HAVE

01:16:17.606 --> 01:16:18.907
IT ADMITTED MARKET PRICE THAT

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:20.609
ALLOWS INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:22.444
COMPETE IN EVERY OMMUNITY.

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.212
THAT IS WHAT WE NEED NOT SOME

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:25.948
RELIANCE UPON THE FAIR PLAN.

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.816
WELL ABOVE THE FIRST AND I ALSO

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:29.751
JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE-THE

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:30.919
REASON I HAVE SO MANY OF YOU

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.154
KNOW QUESTIONS AND CREE AUSSIE

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.956
I HAPPEN TO CULTURE THE ENERGY

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:34.890
AN ENTRANCE STABILITY WORKING

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:37.125
GROUP. WITH CENTER MCGUIRE

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:38.760
WE'VE BEEN WORKING SINCE.

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:40.295
NOVEMBER AND HAVING DIFFERENT

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:42.097
HEARINGS AND JUST SAY LISTEN TO

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:44.032
ALL SIDES AND I THINK THAT. NOW

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.100
THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IS

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:47.135
COMMITTED TO PROTECTING

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:49.071
CONSUMERS AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:50.539
THEY HAVE INSURANCE AND WE

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:51.840
HAPPEN TO REPRESENTS SIMILAR

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:53.508
COMMUNITY SO. SO I THINK

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:55.043
EVERYONE'S TRYING TO FIND THE

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.278
ANSWER AND IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:59.214
AND US SO. I'M REALLY- THANKFUL

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:00.582
THAT YOU'RE ALL HERE TRYING TO

01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:02.951
GIVE US BOTH SIDES- BUT I HAVE

01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:04.920
ONE MORE QUESTION AND- AND IT

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:06.421
PERTAINS TO RACHEL THREE

01:17:06.488 --> 01:17:08.557
INSURANCE- BECAUSE I YOU KNOW

01:17:08.623 --> 01:17:09.391
I'VE EXPRESS AND AGAIN I KNOW

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.625
THAT YOU'RE GOING T LITIGATION

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:14.262
AND PLEASE TELL ME A FIVE. WHAT

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:14.863
YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT WHAT YOU

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:17.065
CANNOT. IF THEY DO. ALL THE

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:18.533
ENSURE. YOU KNOW AND I ASKED

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.802
THIS QUESTION PREVIOUSLY- MY

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:22.704
CONCERN IS THAT NOW THEY HAVE

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:24.573
TO FOCUS ON A WORKERS

01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:27.876
COMPENSATION INSURANCE. AND

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:29.011
LAST TIME IS THAT YOU COULD AND

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:30.579
SHARE CAN YOU SHARE NOW HOLD

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:32.948
THAT IT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:37.652
WAY THE FAIR PLAN DOES BUSINESS.

01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:40.255
THE OKAY WELL I THINK I CAN

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.057
ANSWER THAT SO THAT THE FAIR

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:44.860
PLAN GENERALLY USES OUTSIDE

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:48.263
ADJUSTERS TO. IN A DO THE DAY

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:51.299
TO DAY WORK OF- INSPECTING AND

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:55.270
CLAIMS AND DETERMINING PAYMENT.

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:58.807
AND WORKERS COMP THE BILL THE

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:00.809
PIECE OF WENT WORKERS

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:03.045
COMPENSATION CALLED REFER TO IS

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:05.247
INCIDENTAL WORKERS COMP IS A

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:08.950
VERY LOW LEVEL LOSS RATIO I

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:10.786
MEAN IT IT IS TYPICALLY MAY BE

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:13.188
A FIFTEEN DOLLAR PIECE OF YOUR

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:15.290
HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. SO THERE

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:16.958
ARE VERY FEW LOSSES WE'RE

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:20.095
TALKING ABOUT THIS IS IN OF

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:21.797
SOMEBODY THAT. DOESN'T

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:23.732
REGULARLY WORK FOR YOU AS AN

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.534
EMPLOYEE BUT COMES ON YOUR

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.436
PROPERTY TO DO SOME KIND OF

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:29.271
WORK. BEING INJURED. IT'S

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:32.107
EXTREMELY RARE SO IT. THE

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:34.042
INCIDENT ALL WORKERS COMP IS

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:37.112
NOT REALLY A GENERATOR OF MUCH

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:40.382
WORKLOAD. THE LIABILITY PIECE

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:42.751
IS SUPER IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:45.253
TO HAVE. MOST PEOPLE DON'T GO

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.389
OUT AND BUY A D. I. C. OR A

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:49.057
LIABILITY POLICY EVEN THOUGH

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:51.693
THEY SHOULD. IT IT CAN HAVE A

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.395
CATASTROPHIC LOSS BUT THE

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.664
NUMBER OF CLAIMS ARE RELATIVELY

01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:58.100
LOW. GENERALLY ON HOMEOWNERS

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:01.002
COVERAGE. SO IT'S THE SMALLER

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:03.405
PART OF THE PRICE AND OF A

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:05.807
HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. IT'S JUST

01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:07.976
VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE BEEN

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:09.911
GIVEN HW LITTLE PEOPLE KINDA

01:19:09.978 --> 01:19:12.280
KNOW ABOUT INSURANCE MANY DON'T

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:16.084
KNOW TO GO BY THAT D. IC OR BY

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:18.186
THE LIGHT A LIABILITY POLICY.

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:20.088
SO IT'S MORE WORK FOR THE FAIR

01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:22.290
PLAN DEFINITELY BUT THEY ARE

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:23.091
GOING TO BE GETTING THE

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:25.327
COMPLETE PREMIUM OF AN H. O.

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:27.996
THREE POLICY. TO PAY FOR THE

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:30.065
EXPENSES OF THE COVERAGES THAT

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:31.800
THEY'LL BE OFFERING. WELL AND

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:33.268
JUST TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE LIKE I

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:34.736
SAID I'VE HEARD SO MUCH OF THIS

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:36.138
INFORMATION ALREADY AND I KNOW

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:37.172
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THE FOR A

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:39.441
PLAN NEXT TIME BUT- WHEN THEY

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:41.776
SAID- THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:42.577
INFRASTRUCTURE IN AND DISCUSS

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:43.912
HI HAVING TO IMPLEMENT

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:45.013
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.448
OFFER THIS KIND OF COVERAGE

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.884
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND WELL AND

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.385
AGAIN YOU KNOW I GOT THAT

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:51.987
INFORMATION IN A REPORT. THE

01:19:52.053 --> 01:19:54.856
AVERAGE COST PER- CONSUMER IS

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:56.791
GOING TO BE AROUND THREE

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:58.660
HUNDRED DOLLARS THE COST THAT'S

01:19:58.727 --> 01:20:00.095
GONNA GOAL HI SO WHEN WE TALK

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:01.029
ABOUT FIFTEEN DOLLARS NOT BEING

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.497
A BIG DEAL FOR THIS TYPE OF

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:03.999
INSURANCE BUT- BUT THEN THEY

01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:05.800
HAVE TO UPSET OF THE

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:08.003
INFRASTRUCTURE AND- HIGHER THE

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:10.138
PEOPLE AND- AND OF THAT'S GONNA

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:12.340
COST THE RATES TO GO UP. THIS

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:14.009
WAS NOT JUST A FIFTEEN DOLLARS

01:20:14.075 --> 01:20:16.211
IT'S BUT COSTS THAT THEY'RE

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:18.280
GOING TO HAVE TO. PASS ON TO

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:20.916
CONSUMER. WELL IT COULD BE AT

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:23.051
THE A COST TO THE INDUSTRY SO

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:25.353
WHEN THE FAIR PLAN WAS PUT IN

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:28.356
PLACE RIGHT WE DECIDED THAT THE

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:30.091
STATE HAD A CRISIS OF COVERAGE

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:31.660
IT WAS GENERALLY FOR PEOPLE IN

01:20:31.726 --> 01:20:34.763
INNER CITIES AND THE INDUSTRY

01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:36.798
WAS WRITING BUSINESS THROUGHOUT

01:20:36.865 --> 01:20:39.134
THE STATE. BUT CHOSE NOT TO

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:42.404
WRITE PEOPLE IN THESE PARTS OF

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:44.272
OUR CITIES IN CALIFORNIA

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:48.643
OAKLAND RICHMOND EAST LA AND TO

01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:50.612
GET THAT ROLLING AYE THERE WAS

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.714
AN ASSESSMENT TO THE INDUSTRY

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:55.150
TO GET IT MOVING FORWARD I

01:20:55.217 --> 01:20:56.351
DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S NECESSARY

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:59.487
NOW THE FAIR PLAN ACTUALLY. IT

01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:02.357
IS BUILDING A SURPLUS NOW THEY

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:04.993
HAVE INCREASED THEIR RATES IN A

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:05.627
THEY HAVE SUFFERED SEVERE

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:08.263
LOSSES BUT WHETHER THEY NEED TO

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:11.032
DO AN ASSESSMENT TO ACTUALLY.

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:13.501
CREATE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE I'D

01:21:13.568 --> 01:21:14.436
I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:16.938
NECESSARILY SO AND I WOULDN'T

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:18.673
NECESSARILY RELY ON THE NUMBERS

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.842
THEY'VE SHARED IN TERMS OF THE

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:23.211
COST WE HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:25.380
AT WHAT THAT WOULD BE. BUT IF

01:21:25.447 --> 01:21:27.249
YOU DETERMINE THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:21:27.315 --> 01:21:29.384
A NEED FOR THIS COVERAGE. THEN

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:32.621
IT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY

01:21:32.687 --> 01:21:34.889
PROTECTS YOUR COMMUNITY YOU YOU

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:38.526
DON'T WANT PEOPLE OF MALE MEN

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:39.461
GOING ON TO A PROPERTY DOESN'T

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:41.896
HAVE INSURANCE OR OR PARTNERS

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:44.032
GOING ON OR WORKMEN. AND THEN

01:21:44.099 --> 01:21:45.033
FINDING THE PERSON HAS NO

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.701
LIABILITY COVERAGE IN A WORKERS

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:49.137
COMP COVERAGE. IT IS IN CENTRAL

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:51.239
IT'S WHY EVERYBODY THAT'S VICE

01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:53.041
COVERAGE IN THE ADMITTED MARKET

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:55.377
BUYS A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY THEY

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:58.280
DON'T BY A FIRE POLICY IF THEY

01:21:58.346 --> 01:22:00.081
CAN HELP BUT- THE PEOPLE WANT

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:03.118
HOMEOWNERS. AND WE THINK THE

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:05.587
INDUSTRY IS TURNING AWAY PEOPLE

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:06.554
FROM BUYING A HOMEOWNER'S

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:09.057
POLICY. WHY NOT OFFER THEM A

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:11.426
HOMEOWNER'S POLICY IN THE FAIR

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:13.728
PLAN. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:14.629
COMMENTS OR I'M JUST GONNA LET

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:16.765
REX IF YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT

01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:17.565
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONVINCE

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:18.700
DIFFICULT TO HEAR THAT

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.035
STATEMENT I MEAN THE DEPARTMENT

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:21.202
OF INSURANCE IS ESTABLISH A

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:23.405
PRICING LEVEL AND THEN WANTS TO

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:25.607
ACT AS IF THE- NORMAL REACTION

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.075
WHICH IS A RESTRICTION OF

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:28.109
UNDERWRITING ASSIST PRICE TO

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:29.978
THEM. SO IT'S JUST A POLICY

01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:32.414
CHOICE. IF THE DEPARTMENT WANTS

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.815
TO KEEP RATE LEVELS WHERE THEY

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.450
ARE THERE IS AN OBVIOUS IN

01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:37.218
AFFABLE REACTION IF YOU REDUCE

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:38.820
THE PRICE OF SOMETHING YOU'RE

01:22:38.887 --> 01:22:39.421
GOING TO GET LESS OF A SUPPLY

01:22:39.487 --> 01:22:42.324
OF SOMETHING. SO OF COURSE

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:43.191
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE IN THE

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:44.459
BUSINESS OF SELLING HOMEOWNERS

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:45.727
INSURANCE AND THEY GO TO GREAT

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.195
LENGTHS TO MARKET ESTABLISHES

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:48.463
SHOULD BE XIN NETWORKS AND YOU

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:50.131
CAN'T. FIND A LITTLE LEAGUE

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:52.367
BASEBALL FANS IN THE ENTIRE

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:53.635
STATE THAT DOESN'T HAVE SOME

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:55.470
INSURANCE AGENTS NAME ON IT. SO

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:56.971
OF COURSE THEY WANT TO BE OUT

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:58.973
THERE SELLING INSURANCE. SO THE

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.608
ANSWER IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:03.211
VOLUNTARY MARKET CAN. AND THAT

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:04.279
PEOPLE WOULD EVEN HAVE TO WORRY

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:05.413
ABOUT DO I NEED TO DE I SEE

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:06.781
POLICY OR WHAT'S GOING TO BE

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:08.016
THE COST OF THE FAIR PLAN THE

01:23:08.083 --> 01:23:09.517
ANSWER IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:10.785
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET IS

01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:13.621
VIBRANT. AND THAT WE JUST GET

01:23:13.688 --> 01:23:14.322
TO A NORMALIZED PROPS BECAUSE

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:16.391
OVER TIME WE JUST SIMPLY FALLEN

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:18.693
BEHIND IN OUR TRYING TO CATCH

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.295
UP. AND IF I DON'T CATCH UP

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:23.665
SOON THERE'S JUST TO BE MORE

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.200
AVAILABILITY ISSUES UNTIL WE DO.

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:26.701
OKAY THANK YOU AND I JUST WANT

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:27.402

SOLUTIONS WE REALLY. TO HAVE

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:33.341

GOVERNMENT IN THE MARKETPLACE.

01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:53.695
GETS RATHER AWKWARD- AND SO.

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:55.363
WE'RE SEEING IT IN OTHER AREAS

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:56.798
INCLUDING ENERGY. WERE KIND OF

KIND OF MIGRATION INTO OTHER.

01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:15.383
AREAS OF THE STATE WERE WERE.

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:17.218
SEEING THEM SUBSIDIZE.

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:18.953
INSURANCE POLICIES IN IN THESE

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.055
AREAS I JUST WANT TO. KIND OF

01:24:21.122 --> 01:24:22.690
ASK THE DIRTY QUESTION YEAH I

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:24.526
MEAN IT'S A DIFFICULT. QUESTION

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:26.361
RIVER A RIGHT THERE'S A RISK TO

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:28.430
DOING THAT- BECAUSE IF YOU

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:30.098
ESTABLISH TO LOW OF A PRICE IN

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:33.001
A HIGH RISK. AREA OFFSET IT.

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:34.969
WITH TO HAVE A PRICE AND LOWER

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.538
RISK AREA THEN YOU'LL GET OUT

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:40.775
COMPETED IN THE LOW RISK AREA.

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.610
SO IT'S DIFFICULT SO THE MARK

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:43.244
GENERALLY WOULD DISSUADE THAT

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:46.514
TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. IT'S NOT TO

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:49.918
SAY IT. CAN'T EXIST- BUT AT

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:50.552
THIS POINT- YOU'D HAVE TO LOOK

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:52.353
AT EACH COMPANY AND FIGURE OUT

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.022
HOW THEY'RE HANDLING THAT- YOU

01:24:54.088 --> 01:24:56.424
KNOW IF COMPANIES COULD. STAY

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:58.126
IN HIGH RISK AREAS BY BRINGING

01:24:58.193 --> 01:25:00.395
IN- PREMIUM FROM OTHER AREAS

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:01.362
THAT WOULD IT WOULD BE GREAT

01:25:01.429 --> 01:25:03.364
FOR THEM BUT I THINK IT'S- VERY

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:04.833
DIFFICULT. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:07.769
OKAY. AT AND I DON'T GIVE A

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:09.804
LESSON NOT THIRTY SECONDS

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:10.705
BECAUSE WE NEED ON. WORDS IN

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:12.073
MISTER ROGERS MOUTH BUT I THINK

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.008
WE JUST HEARD HIM SUGGEST AS

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:15.276
WHEN YOU ASKED ABOUT THE FAIR

01:25:15.343 --> 01:25:17.345
PLAN THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:18.980
THAT ARRESTED IT'D BE PRETTY

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:20.515
EXORBITANT FOR THEM TO

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:22.684
IMPLEMENT AN H. O. THREE- AND

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:24.486
THEN I THINK YOU SUGGESTED WELL

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:25.820
YOU COULD HAVE INDUSTRY JUST

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:27.822
PAY FOR THEM TO DO THAT. AND IN

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:29.891
MY MIND THAT IS IN AN S. AND

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.126
SAYING WELL LET'S SUBSIDIZE THE

01:25:32.193 --> 01:25:33.361
FAIR PLAN EFFORT THERE BY

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:34.762
PUTTING A SHIFTING ACOSTA WERE

01:25:34.829 --> 01:25:36.498
THE ADMITTED MARKET WHICH WOULD

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:38.366
THEN BE. SUBSIDIZING THAT

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:40.535
EFFORT OVER THERE SO WE ARE

WHAT IS RE INSURANCE

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:08.389
REINSURANCE IS INSURANCE FOR

01:27:08.456 --> 01:27:10.058
INSURANCE COMPANY. IT'S A

01:27:10.124 --> 01:27:12.927
PRUDENT RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:15.496
THAT HELPS INSURANCE RIGHT MORE

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:17.432

PROMISES TO THAT POLICY

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:25.974
HOLDERS. WHAT REINSURANCE DOES

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.277
NOT DO IS IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE

01:27:29.344 --> 01:27:31.713
RISK AT ALL. SO THE RISK OF

01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:34.115
WILDFIRE DOESN'T CHANGE BECAUSE

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:36.184
YOU HAVE INSURANCE AND RISK OF

01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:38.052
WILDFIRE DOESN'T CHANGE.

01:27:38.119 --> 01:27:39.921
BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANY

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:42.357
HAS REINSURANCE. EVERY

01:27:42.423 --> 01:27:45.159
INSURANCE DOES IS IT CHANGES

01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:47.462
WHO PAYS PART OF THE LOS. AND

01:27:47.528 --> 01:27:48.830
WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE

01:27:48.896 --> 01:27:50.798
REINSURANCE INDUSTRY IS WE ARE

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:53.101
A GLOBAL INDUSTRY WE SPREAD THE

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:55.903
RISK THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:57.138
WHEN THERE IS A CATASTROPHIC

01:27:57.205 --> 01:28:00.742
FIRE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:02.510
WILL GET AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:04.746
FROM THE MONEY COMING FROM.

01:28:04.812 --> 01:28:07.115
GLOBAL POCKET BOOKS AND THE

01:28:07.181 --> 01:28:09.450
CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA WILL

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:13.655
HAVE THEIR CLAIMS PAID. THE

01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:16.024
GLOBAL MARKET IS HUGE WE ARE

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:17.659
COMPETING AS THE REINSURANCE

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:18.993
COMPANIES AGAINST OF THE

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.762
REINSURANCE COMPANIES AND

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:22.497
AGAINST THE CAPITAL MARKETS WHO

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:24.399
HAVE FOUND THAT INSURANCE

01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:27.635
LINKED SECURITIES WHICH IS

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:30.004
BASICALLY A MEANS OF THE

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:32.006
INSURANCE THE CAPITAL MARKETS

01:28:32.073 --> 01:28:33.341
PENSION FUNDS ETCETERA

01:28:33.408 --> 01:28:35.276
COMPETING IN THE REINSURANCE

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:38.746
MARKET. IS IN THE TRILLIONS OF

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:41.149
DOLLARS SO WE HAVE THIS. NO

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:44.018
SHORTAGE OF CAPACITY THERE IS

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:46.087
AMPLE CAPACITY FOR THE RISK.

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:48.823
THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH RISK

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:51.693
IS THERE. AND THAT TURNS US TO

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:53.828
WILD FIRES SO THE FIRST THING

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:55.163
YOU HAVE A CHART IN FRONT OF

01:28:55.229 --> 01:29:00.334
YOU I HOPE. WHICH IS HAS. ZERO

01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:02.136
ATTRIBUTION ON IT I WILL TELL

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:04.739
YOU- WHAT THAT IS- AFTER A

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:07.008
DISCUSSION YESTERDAY SOMEBODY I

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:09.744
WAS ASKED YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE

01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:11.312
HISTORY OF WILDFIRE LOSS IN

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:13.181
CALIFORNIA AND I FOUND A MUNICH

01:29:13.247 --> 01:29:16.184
RE CHART- THAT HAD THE ENTIRE

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:19.053
NATION ON S. BUT I SAID YOU

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.121
HAVE CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC DATA

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.489
AND I WAS SENT THIS THIS

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:23.458
MORNING IT DOESN'T SAY MUNICH

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:24.726
RE BY MUNICH RE IS ONE OF THE

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:27.028
LARGEST IF NOT THE LARGEST

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:28.963
REINSURER IN THE WORLD AND THEY

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:31.499
TRACK. NATURAL DISASTER RISKS

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:32.366
AND THEY HAVE AN ONLINE

01:29:32.433 --> 01:29:35.336
DATABASE- THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:38.473
BUT WHAT THEY HAVE HERE IS THE

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:41.109
CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE LOSSES

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:43.945
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY. AND THIS

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:45.813
INCLUDES COMMERCIAL AS WELL AS

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.982
RESIDENTIAL BUT I WAS TOLD THAT

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:50.318
THE RULE OF THUMB IS 85% OF

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:51.552
THESE LOSSES THE REST ARE

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:53.955
RESIDENTIAL. SO IF YOU LOOK AT

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:56.023
THE IDEA OF YOU AND YOUR SOLELY

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:58.760
CONCERNED WITH RESIDENTIAL

01:29:58.826 --> 01:30:00.528
YEAH. SHOP A LITTLE BIT OFF.

01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:03.664
WHAT'S TELLING ABOUT THIS

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:08.569
CHARGE IS THAT THE YEARS OF

01:30:08.636 --> 01:30:11.072
TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:11.606
EIGHTEEN INDIVIDUALLY AND

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:14.809
COLLECTIVELY DWARF THE THIRTY

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:16.778
SIX YEARS PRIOR TO THAT. AND

01:30:16.844 --> 01:30:18.446
IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY STARTLING

01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:21.849
THE DIFFERENCE. AND THE

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:23.751
QUESTION IS HISTORY STILL

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:27.789
APPROPRIATE. TO EVALUATE WHAT

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:29.857
THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BRING IS

01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:31.492
THERE A NEW NORMAL DUE TO

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:35.363
CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT THE POLICY%

01:30:35.429 --> 01:30:36.364
QUESTION THAT'S THE

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:37.932
UNDERWRITING QUESTION THAT'S

01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:39.567
THE RISK THAT WE IN THE

01:30:39.634 --> 01:30:41.002
INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:43.237
INDUSTRIES ALL GRAPPLING WITH

01:30:43.304 --> 01:30:45.873
AS WE TRY TO DEVELOP- INSURANCE

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.942
AND REINSURANCE PORTFOLIOS ON A

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:49.944
FORWARD LOOKING BASIS BECAUSE

01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:53.514
WE'RE ACTUALLY. PRICING NOW FOR

01:30:53.581 --> 01:30:57.385
WHAT THE NEXT YEAR WILL BRING.

01:30:57.451 --> 01:31:00.788
SO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AS POLICY

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:02.857
MAKERS THE ONE THING YOU SHOULD

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:05.126
DO IS CONTINUE YOUR RISK

01:31:05.193 --> 01:31:08.262
REDUCTION EFFORTS- THE

01:31:08.329 --> 01:31:11.632
REDUCTION OF WILDFIRE FUELS THE

01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:14.569
TAKING DOWN OF AS MANY- DEAD

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:16.771
TREES AS POSSIBLE AND

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:18.139
CONTINUING TO DO IT BECAUSE

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:20.508
IT'S A MAINTENANCE THING- THE-

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:24.579
WILD WILD GRASSES AND- AND

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:27.281
TREES GROW IF YOU DON'T.

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:30.751
ROUTINELY MAINTAIN- THOSE AREAS

01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:32.553
SO WE NEED TO DO THAT WE NEED

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:34.388
TO ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE THE- THE

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:35.756
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO ITS

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:37.491
PART WITH THE FOR THE FEDERAL

01:31:37.558 --> 01:31:40.761
WILDLIFE SINCE- WE NEED TO JUST

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:43.497
CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE- DATE

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:45.833
THE FUELS AS POSSIBLE AND WE

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.536
NEED TO EVALUATE HOW AND WHERE

01:31:48.603 --> 01:31:52.673
WE BUILD- I BHS WHICH IS THE

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.942
INDUSTRY'S. OF RESILIENCY

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:57.345
EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHAT'S THE

01:31:57.411 --> 01:31:58.980
BEST WAY TO BUILD HOMES IS

01:31:59.046 --> 01:32:00.982
FOCUSING VERY VERY MUCH-

01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:03.184
WILDFIRE ACTUALLY SAW ONE OF

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:05.052
THEIR WILD FIRE PRESENTATIONS

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:08.689
LINES- IT REALLY THEY THEY HAVE

01:32:08.756 --> 01:32:10.825
A WILDFIRE GENERATOR AND THEY

01:32:10.892 --> 01:32:13.027
CREATE AN EMBER STORM. AND THEY

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:14.629
SHOOT IT AT TO THAT HOUSE

01:32:14.695 --> 01:32:16.764
THAT'S BILL TWO WAYS A

01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:18.933
CONVENTIONAL HOUSE AND EIGHTY A

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.103
BETTER DEVELOPED HOUSE- AND THE

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:24.338
BETTER DEVELOPED HOUSE DOES

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:26.407
MUCH BETTER- SO. HOW YOU BUILD

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:27.909
IN WAY YOU BILLS VERY

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:30.411
IMPORTANT- MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:33.948
THAT- CONSUMER THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:37.285
HOME MITIGATION IS NOT. AS GOOD

01:32:37.351 --> 01:32:38.986
AS INDIVIDUAL HOME MITIGATION

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:41.555
AND COMMUNITY WIDE MITIGATION

01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:44.525
SO TO COMMUNITY WIDE MITIGATION

01:32:44.592 --> 01:32:47.528
IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND FINAL. I

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:49.764
WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO

REINSURERS TAKE THEIR ANTI

01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:27.354
TRUST. OBLIGATIONS VERY

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:29.857
SERIOUSLY AND THEY DO NOT DO

01:40:29.923 --> 01:40:31.125
NOT I MEAN WE SAW AT EVERY

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:33.093
MEETING WITH AN ANTI TRUST

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:36.430

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:40.100
PRICING BETWEEN OURSELVES- SO.

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:42.202
WE ARE NOT DOING THAT SO I WILL

01:40:42.269 --> 01:40:45.038

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:47.541
CONCEPTS AND HOW MY

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:50.177

01:40:52.613 --> 01:40:56.316
THEORIES- SO. TYPICALLY WHEN

01:40:56.383 --> 01:40:59.486
INSURANCE IS. RIGHT A BEST OF

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:01.522
WE JUST TAKE A STEP BACK- WE

01:41:01.588 --> 01:41:03.724
ARE ALSO- TO CERTAIN EXTENT I

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:05.259
HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH THE

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:07.161
MOTHER SHIP COMMENT BECAUSE

01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:10.898
MANY OF THE- INSURANCES ARE

01:41:10.964 --> 01:41:12.699
BIGGER THAN TO RE ENTERS. SO

01:41:12.766 --> 01:41:14.868
THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST

01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:17.037
PROTECTING THEIR- YOU KNOW

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:18.839
THEIR BUSINESS BUT THERE THAT

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:20.741
THEY'VE BEEN WRITING SO MANY

01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:22.810
POLICIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:41:22.876 --> 01:41:24.178
THERE THEY HAVE THE

01:41:24.244 --> 01:41:26.313
POTENTIALITY OF WHAT I CALL

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.949
SPIKE LOSSES THAT. FAR EXCEED

01:41:29.016 --> 01:41:31.718
THEIR- THEIR EXPECTED LOSSES

01:41:31.785 --> 01:41:33.420
AND THEIR RISK TOLERANCE SO

01:41:33.487 --> 01:41:35.622
THEY'LL BUY REINSURANCE TO HELP

01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:36.924
THEM MANAGE THEIR BOOK

01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:40.327
BUSINESS. AND AS REINSURER IS

01:41:40.394 --> 01:41:42.996
WHAT MY MEMBERS TO IS BECAUSE

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:44.631
THERE IT'S A GLOBAL BUSINESS

01:41:44.698 --> 01:41:47.801
THEY BUILD A PORTFOLIO OF RISK

01:41:47.868 --> 01:41:51.238
WHICH TRIES TO RIGHT.

01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:52.573

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:11.091
EVERYTHING THAT COULD GO WRONG

01:42:11.158 --> 01:42:12.893
THAT WE WRITE CHILE WE WRITE

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.795
AUSTRALIA WE WRITE EVERYTHING

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:17.130

COLLECT ENOUGH PREMIUM. TO PAY

01:42:19.733 --> 01:42:22.269
FOR LOSSES THAT MAY OCCUR. AND

01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:24.204
TO PAY FOR EXPENSES AND THEN

01:42:24.271 --> 01:42:25.672
HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION

01:42:25.739 --> 01:42:27.908
OF PROCESS SO INSURANCE IS

01:42:27.975 --> 01:42:29.610
BASED UPON THE THEORY THAT BAD

01:42:29.676 --> 01:42:30.878
THINGS DON'T HAPPEN TO

01:42:30.944 --> 01:42:32.746
EVERYBODY AT THE SAME TIME SO

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:34.414
WE TRY TO CREATE A POOL OF

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:38.552
RISK. THAT FOR NEXT YEAR WILL

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:39.419
GIVE US A REASONABLE

01:42:39.486 --> 01:42:41.154
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE PROFIT IT'S

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:43.757
NOT THAT WE'RE SAYING I'M GOING

01:42:43.824 --> 01:42:46.827

FREQUENTLY IT. THE FACT THAT IN

01:42:57.037 --> 01:42:58.572
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF

01:42:58.639 --> 01:43:02.242
THE VALUES THAT WE HAVE HERE-

01:43:02.309 --> 01:43:04.077
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET OTHER

01:43:04.144 --> 01:43:06.513
RISKS TO BALANCE IT OUT SO

01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:08.582
HEADS- IS COMPETITIVE MARKET

01:43:08.649 --> 01:43:11.985

REINSURANCE FOR INSURANCE IN IN

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:05.672
ROMAN TIMES- AT THE PORTS- THE

01:44:05.739 --> 01:44:06.707
INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD HAVE

01:44:06.773 --> 01:44:08.609
BEEN BENCHES AND THEY WOULD

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:11.178
INSURE CARGO AND IF THE SHIP

01:44:11.244 --> 01:44:13.513

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:15.182
INSURANCE COMPANY WOULD HAVE TO

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:17.117
PAY THE MERCHANTS THAT LOST

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:18.986
THEIR GOODS IF THE INSURANCE

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:21.655

WERE NOT PERMITTED TO TRANSACT

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:27.461
ANY MORE BUSINESS- AND THAT'S

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:30.230
WHERE WE GET THE TERM BONTA.

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:32.299
RECTUS BANKRUPTCY. AND SO WE

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:37.404
HAVE FISCAL TOOLS IN PLACE THAT

01:44:37.471 --> 01:44:39.506

ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS

01:45:10.203 --> 01:45:12.372
THEY DID DID PREVIOUSLY- TO

01:45:12.439 --> 01:45:13.940

NEED YES THERE THE CRISIS

01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.682
BECAUSE THEY WERE FAR AWAY FROM

01:45:21.748 --> 01:45:23.617
THE CRISIS THAT WE HAD AFTER

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:27.421
THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE- NEAR

01:45:27.487 --> 01:45:29.222
THE LEGISLATURE FORM THE

01:45:29.289 --> 01:45:31.091
CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:33.593
AND THE REINSURANCE INDUSTRY IS

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.162
WHAT MADE THAT WORK. NOW WE

01:45:35.228 --> 01:45:38.031
BACK THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY

01:45:38.098 --> 01:45:40.067
WHEN IT HAD A LOT OF RISK AND

01:45:40.133 --> 01:45:41.535
VERY LITTLE MONEY AND WE

01:45:41.601 --> 01:45:46.139
CONTINUED BACK IS- SO. ONE IT A

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:49.009
WE ACTUALLY ARE PART OF MAKING

01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:50.711
INSURANCE AVAILABLE WHETHER

01:45:50.777 --> 01:45:51.745

TO WRITE AS MUCH BUSINESS OR

01:46:05.826 --> 01:46:07.928
WOULD HAVE TO HOLD A LOT MORE

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:10.197
CAPITAL THAN THEY DO TODAY. AND

01:46:10.263 --> 01:46:13.133
THEN BECAUSE- WHERE A PROFIT

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:16.436
DRIVEN. ECONOMY IF THEY HAVE TO

01:46:16.503 --> 01:46:18.605
HOLD TWICE AS MUCH CAPITAL YOU

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:19.973
KNOW THERE INVESTORS ARE GOING

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:22.342
TO WANT TO RETURN ON CAPITAL-

01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:24.845
AND THAT CAPITAL IS IN USE ALL

01:46:24.911 --> 01:46:26.246
THAT FREQUENTLY. THE

01:46:26.313 --> 01:46:29.149

DOUBLE EXPENSE LOW THERE IS NO

01:53:02.942 --> 01:53:04.744
LOAD. SO THAT THAT'S NOT A

01:53:04.811 --> 01:53:06.613
FACTOR AND THE REALITY IS THAT.

01:53:06.679 --> 01:53:08.281
THE ROLE OF THE FAIR PLAN IS

01:53:08.348 --> 01:53:10.150
PLAYING IS FEELING THE NEED

01:53:10.216 --> 01:53:12.018
THAT IT'S DESIGNED FOR TODAY.

01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:13.419

ENDORSEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE.

01:53:28.935 --> 01:53:30.136
WELL BEYOND JUST LOOKING AT THE

01:53:30.203 --> 01:53:31.671
LIABILITY COMPONENT THAT THAT

01:53:31.738 --> 01:53:33.640

01:53:38.711 --> 01:53:40.046
MONTHS OR SO WHEN THIS REALLY

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:43.283
THIS CRISIS REALLY. ERUPTED I-

01:53:43.349 --> 01:53:45.418

CONSUMERS INSURANCE THAT ARE IN

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:49.722
THE- CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAVE HAD

01:53:49.789 --> 01:53:50.557
TO BE WITH THE FAIR PLAN. IN A

01:53:50.623 --> 01:53:53.193
DEEP I SEE ONE OF THE AS HE

01:53:53.259 --> 01:53:54.527
POLICIES. AND THERE'S A ONE

01:53:54.594 --> 01:53:56.162
PERSON AT A OR OR BUSINESS THAT

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:58.631
I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OFFER A- A

01:53:58.698 --> 01:54:00.800
SOLID QUOTE FOR. THE P. IS.

01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:04.404
ALTHOUGH WE ARE. IN A TOUGH. I

01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:07.307
SEE GOOD NIGHT KNOWING THAT MY-

01:54:07.373 --> 01:54:10.510
ARE. OF POP. FEATURED WITH THE

01:54:10.577 --> 01:54:13.980
PRODUCTS OF WILL TO AND- PLAY.

01:54:14.047 --> 01:54:21.688
KEEP GIVE HER. ARMALITE ALSO IN

01:54:21.754 --> 01:54:22.722
A- ARE. MOSTLY OF ELDER I

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:23.356
COUNTY BUT WE ALL THIS IS KIND

01:54:23.423 --> 01:54:24.190
OF OUR- SO HARD TO PLACE

01:54:24.257 --> 01:54:24.757
HOMEOWNER INSURANCE ACROSS

01:54:24.824 --> 01:54:25.391
CALIFORNIA. COLORADO ALL OF THE

01:54:25.458 --> 01:54:27.527
HIGH FIRE AND SORT OF AREAS.

01:54:27.594 --> 01:54:29.028
THE ONE THING THAT I SAW DURING

01:54:29.095 --> 01:54:31.397
THIS IS THESE CHARTS SHOW AN

01:54:31.464 --> 01:54:32.865
AVERAGE ACROSS CALIFORNIA BUT

01:54:32.932 --> 01:54:33.967
WHAT THEY DON'T DO A SHOW YOU

01:54:34.033 --> 01:54:34.934
THE SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:35.768
HAPPENING TO THE RURAL

01:54:35.835 --> 01:54:37.737
COMMUNITIES. SO WE LOOK AT JUST

01:54:37.804 --> 01:54:38.871
MY BOOK OF BUSINESS WITH

01:54:38.938 --> 01:54:41.207
CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN. IT IS NOW

01:54:41.274 --> 01:54:43.209
THE LARGEST OF PROPERTY INSURER

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:44.844
WITHIN MY AGENCY THAT SHOULD

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:46.512
NOT BE THE CASE. THE AVERAGE

01:54:46.579 --> 01:54:48.281
HOMEOWNER IN THESE REGIONS ARE

01:54:48.348 --> 01:54:50.917
PAYING ACTUALLY ABOUT FOUR

01:54:50.984 --> 01:54:51.551
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE

01:54:51.618 --> 01:54:53.253
HOMEOWNERS COSTS. PREVIOUS TO

01:54:53.319 --> 01:54:55.355
THAT AND THE- LIKE SACRAMENTO

01:54:55.421 --> 01:54:57.090
AREAS WERE LOOKING AT MORE LIKE

01:54:57.156 --> 01:54:58.324
EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:54:58.391 --> 01:55:00.226
SO THE GAP IS EXTREME BETWEEN

01:55:00.293 --> 01:55:01.361
THOSE AREAS AND IN THE WILD

01:55:01.427 --> 01:55:03.663
LAND AREAS BUT IT'S NOT BEING

01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:04.864
ACCOUNTED FOR IT IS NOT BEING

01:55:04.931 --> 01:55:07.267
ASSESSED TO. THAT IMPACT. AS

01:55:07.333 --> 01:55:08.768
WELL AS IF WE LOOK TO EL DORADO

01:55:08.835 --> 01:55:10.336
COUNTY THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE

01:55:10.403 --> 01:55:11.771
LEAST AMOUNT OF FIRE PROTECTION

01:55:11.838 --> 01:55:13.106
ACROSS THE OTHER COUNTY SO

01:55:13.172 --> 01:55:14.073
THEY'RE PAYING HIGHER

01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:15.942
PERCENTAGES. IT'S CAUSING THIS

01:55:16.009 --> 01:55:17.343
REAL ESTATE MARKET ACTUALLY

01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:19.345
DECLINE OR SEEN THE LOSS OF

01:55:19.412 --> 01:55:21.114
REVENUE ALREADY START TO AFFECT

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:22.482
THESE REGIONS. AND AT

01:55:22.548 --> 01:55:24.117
ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO AFFECT

01:55:24.183 --> 01:55:25.218
THE FIRE STATIONS THERE AND IS

01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:26.719
GOING TO PERPETUATE THIS IF WE

01:55:26.786 --> 01:55:27.687
DON'T START TO SEE SOMETHING

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:29.889
CHANGE. SO WHAT WE HAVE REALLY

01:55:29.956 --> 01:55:31.691
BEEN FOCUSING ON UP THERE IS

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:33.393
FIRE WEIS COMMUNITIES TO HELP

01:55:33.459 --> 01:55:34.894
THESE MEDICATIONS I WORK VERY

01:55:34.961 --> 01:55:35.928
CLOSELY WITH THE INSURANCE

01:55:35.995 --> 01:55:37.664
COMPANIES. ON WHAT THEY'RE

01:55:37.730 --> 01:55:39.465
GOING TO NEED TO COME BACK AND-

01:55:39.532 --> 01:55:41.267
THE MEDICATION IS A VERY STRONG

01:55:41.334 --> 01:55:42.802
THING FOR THEM THE FIRE WEIS

01:55:42.869 --> 01:55:44.537
COMMUNITIES THE HOME HARDENING.

01:55:44.604 --> 01:55:45.938
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD CLEAR

01:55:46.005 --> 01:55:47.940
PATH FOR THESE COMMUNITIES ON

01:55:48.007 --> 01:55:49.175
HOW TO STRUCTURE THE FIRE WHY

01:55:49.242 --> 01:55:50.510
IS. WHAT THE INSURANCE

01:55:50.576 --> 01:55:51.944
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO ACCEPT

01:55:52.011 --> 01:55:53.379
AND TO STANDARDIZE THAT UNTIL

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:55.481
WE HAVE THAT. UNTIL WE HAVE

01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:56.883
THAT STANDARDIZATION AND THE

01:55:56.949 --> 01:55:58.751
STANDARDIZATION AND WHAT WILD

01:55:58.818 --> 01:56:00.953
FIRE IS. WE'VE DEFINED IT FOR

FEMA WE DEFINE IT FOR FLOOD IF
