IMPLEMENTATION OF THE V.. SIX SEVENTEEN I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION -- QUESTION VIDAK WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAD LOCAL AIRSTRIKES ARE ON TRACK TO DELIVER ISSUE REDUCTIONS. CALIFORNIA'S MOST POLLUTION BIRD. FEDERAL -- HAVE FOSTERED WANT TO SHARE WITH US AND ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS WE'RE HERE TODAY. WE HAVE IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE JEEP AUTHOR OF THE BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA JOIN US IN A FEW MOMENTS -- AND BUT WE'RE ALSO HEARING TESTIMONY TODAY THE COMMITTEE WOULD BILLS FOR A HOUSE WHERE MEMBERS INSISTED. CAP CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES WAS NOT. GLOBAL CLIMATE LEADERSHIP FOR REAL PROGRESS ON LOCAL. ALSO FORTUNATE TO BE JOINED TODAY BY MANY OF THE KEY FIGURES RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD LOCAL YOUR DISTRICTS AND LEADERS. AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE SELECTED FOR YOUR WIFE REALLY EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. FOR SOME THIS MAY BE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FIRSTHAND WHAT EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN BE DOING TO IMPROVE. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I WAS SIGNED IN DAHLE GARDENS BY GOVERNOR BROWN JUST NINE DAYS LATER. AIRBNB -- DISTRICTS BEGAN WORKING WITH PATIENTS FROM THE ONE THE LEGISLATURE ALL UP WITH NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION FUNDING TWO MONTHS [inaudible] RIGHT. OKAY HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR ME BETTER NOW. NO VOTE IF YOU WANT ME TO REPEAT ALL THAT. I THOUGHT IT SOUNDED STRANGE OKAY -- AIR BE COMPLETED THE FIRST MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION MILESTONES LAST SEPTEMBER INCLUDING SELECTION OF THE FIRST TEN COMMUNITIES AFTER REVIEWING NOMINATIONS FROM AIR DISTRICTS AND DIRECTLY FROM COMMUNITIES. WE'RE NOW ABOUT SIX MONTHS INTO COMMUNITY BASED PROCESSES WITH ABOUT SIX MONTHS LEFT BEFORE EACH OF THE AIR DISTRICTS MUST ADOPT AND SUBMIT TO A R. B. FOR REVIEW. AND EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS PROGRAM FOR EACH COMMUNITY INCLUDING EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS SPECIFIC REDUCTION MEASURES AND IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE AND ENFORCEMENT PLAN. SO ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED TO LEARN HOW THE PROCESSES ARE GOING AND WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME LEFT TO MAKE COURSE CORRECTIONS OF NECESSARY. IT IS ALSO A GOOD TIME TO REMIND OURSELVES OF THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVE OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN IS NOT MERELY TO IDENTIFY WHERE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING THE WORST EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION. WE ALREADY KNOW THAT CITIES IN THE SOUTH COAST IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAVE THE MOST OF YOUR REGIONAL AIR POLLUTION IN THE NATION. AND WE KNOW THAT COMMUNITIES ALL AROUND THE STATE NEAR PORTS REAL ROADS FREEWAYS BORDER TRAFFIC IN CLUSTERS OF INDUSTRY THEIR DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF BOTH REGIONAL POLLUTANTS LIKE SMOG IN PARTICULAR MATTER. AS WELL AS AIR TOXINS. THESE COMMUNITIES SUFFER FROM A RANGE OF HEALTH EFFECTS INCLUDING INCREASED RESPIRATORY AILMENTS HEART DISEASE CANCER RISK AND EVEN DAMAGING CHILD BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. AMONG POCKET POPULATIONS THAT HAVE LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO LIVE WORK AND PLAY AN UNHEALTHY AIR. THE OBJECTIVE OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN IS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. IN ADDITION TO OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE HAVE INVITED MEMBERS REPRESENTING EACH OF THE TEN COMMUNITIES TO JOIN US TODAY. FINALLY AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE COMMUNITY FOCUS PANELS WE WILL INVITE OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE ON OTHER SPECIFIC ISSUES RELATED TO AB SIX SEVENTEEN IMPLEMENTATION. IF YOU WISH TO OFFER COMMENTS PLEASE SIGN IN AT THE SERGEANTS TABLE. WE WILL BE KEEPING TIME BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO SPEAK TODAY AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HEAR EVERYONE AND THAT WE STILL HAVE MEMBERS LEFT IN THE BUILDING -- TO HEAR THE TESTIMONY -- WE'D LIKE TO ADJOURN BEFORE SIX PM AND WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOUR PATIENCE WE WILL BE TIMING THE PANELISTS SO PANELISTS. BE CONCISE GET EVERYTHING OUT BUT SAY IT ONCE -- NOW BEFORE THE WITNESSES FROM A RB BEGIN THEIR PRESENTATIONS I'D LIKE TO INVITE.

I I HEAR FROM -- A WIDE RANGE OF CONSTITUENTS -- THAT ARE CONCERNED. ABOUT -- ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES BUT I I I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT I HEAR FROM. WHO SAY THAT YOU KNOW I I DON'T CARE AS MUCH ABOUT YOU KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE ARE ALL THESE YOU KNOW THESE THESE GLOBAL ISSUES WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS WHETHER MY CHILDREN -- BRETT BREEDING CLEAN AIR AND AND DRINKING CLEAN WATER AND SO I THINK -- TODAY'S SUBJECT MATTER REALLY GOES. TO THAT -- CORE CONCERN THAT I HEAR ACROSS THE BOARD FROM ALL OF MY CONSTITUENTS ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND SO I I APPRECIATE THIS A HEARING. THANK YOU AND THANKS FOR JOINING US TODAY SO I'M GONNA CALL THE PANELS UP ONE BY ONE AND WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL ASK THE PANELISTS IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY INTRODUCTIONS.

SO WITHOUT A FOR AN OVERVIEW OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN FROM THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD I'M GOING TO INVITE OF RICHARD CORY THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER PRODUCT EDT ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFER OFFICER. AND KAREN VALLEY ON OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY -- PROTECTION WELCOME AND THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO CAME TO JOIN US TODAY ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WHO TRAVELED FROM OUT OF THE AREA. WHILE THEY'RE SITTING UP WE'VE JUST BEEN JOINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERCRISTINA GARCIA THE AUTHOR OF SIX SEVENTEEN AND I WILL ASK HER -- IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS BEFORE THE PANEL BEGINS AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU JUST WANNA WELCOME AND THANK EVERYONE WHO IS HERE BUT ALSO THINK EVERYONE ON THE GROUND WHO'S DOING THE WORK. TO TRY TO TAKE THIS FROM A BILL TO A REALITY THAT HOPEFULLY GIVES OF CLEANER COMMUNITIES AND HEALTHIER CONSTITUENTS OUT THERE -- IT'S A IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S WORK AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE INSIDE OF WHERE WE'RE AT AND WHERE WE STILL NEED TO GO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR FRIEDMAN I'M RICHARD CORE AB JACKET OF OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD THANK YOU MEMBERS AS WELL. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIX SEVENTEEN AND THE COMMUNITY PROTECTION PROGRAM. I'LL BE SHARING THIS OVERVIEW PRESENTATION TODAY WITH TWO MEMBERS MY TEAM WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM VERONICA ET. OUR SYSTEM EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO MY LEFT. AND CARE ABOUT THE AUTO THE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY HERE PROTECTION PROGRAM WHICH IS REALLY FORMED ESTABLISH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EFFORT. JB SIX SEVENTEEN SHE NOTED SPONSORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA REPRESENTS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE. AIR QUALITY PROGRAM IN OVER THIRTY YEARS. CALIFORNIA'S AIR QUALITY PROGRAMS HAVE HISTORICALLY FOCUSED ON IMPROVING AIR QUALITY AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL AS WELL AS REDUCING TOXICS RISK. FROM INDIVIDUAL SOURCES. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT PRUDENCE OZONE LEVELS HAVE DROPPED OVER 40% THE SOUTH COAST SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS OF LETTER NOW 90% LOWER AND DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER. WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR OVER TWO THIRDS TWO THIRDS OF THE TOTAL KNOWN CANCER RISK IN THE STATE FROM AIR QUALITY STANDPOINT IS DROPPED NEARLY 70%. HOWEVER HOWEVER. TOO MANY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES ARE STILL DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY POOR AIR QUALITY. SB SIX SEVENTEEN PLACES A RENEWED EMPHASIS ON THE NEED FOR FOCUSED ACTION. TO CLEAN THE AIR IN THESE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. A GREAT DEAL GOES IN A MINUTE A GREAT DEAL PROGRESS HAS OCCURRED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF AND THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF WORK. AHEAD OF US IS ALREADY NOTED IN THIS NEW PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE KEY. TO ITS ULTIMATE SUCCESS. MAYBE YOU CAN SEE IF YOU CAN ADVANCING AND KEEP GOING SYSTEM MULTIPLE ELEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY FOCUSED ACTION THIS INCLUDES BETTER DATA ON A MISSION SOURCES IN THE IMPACTS THE SOURCES HAVE. ON AIR RESIDENTS ON THE REST AIR RESIDENTS ARE BRICK BRIEF BREEDING. AND MAKING THIS DATA MORE AVAILABLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE. THE MOST CRITICALLY. IT'S USING THIS INFORMATION TO INFORM AND NEW STATE AN AIR DISTRICT ACTIONS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. AND EXPOSURE THIS WILL INCLUDE A BROAD SET OF APPROACHES FROM NEW REGULATIONS TO ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT. TO TARGETED INCENTIVE FUNDING. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO ENHANCE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCIES AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES. AS WE ALL HAVE A ROLE IN DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION IN THESE COMMUNITIES. DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING AB SIX SEVENTEEN IS A JOINT EFFORT CHAIRED BY CARP THE LOCAL YOU'RE DISTRICTS AND AS I NOTED MOST IMPORTANTLY THE COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS. THIS EMPHASIS ON COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION EVEN THE GOALS OF AB. SIX SEVENTEEN AND THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY. THEIR PROTECTION PROGRAM AND NOW I'D LIKE TO TURN THE PRESENTATION OVER TO CARE AND TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE WORK TODAY. AND PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM. OKAY THANK YOU RICHARD. SO AS YOU HEARD ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS IN IMPLEMENTING SB SIX SEVENTEEN IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR OUR BOARD APPROVED THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION BLUEPRINT. WHICH ESSENTIALLY OUTLINES THE OVERALL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROGRAM -- AND THE OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IMPLEMENTATION. SO THE BLUEPRINT DESCRIBES BROAD STATEWIDE STRATEGIES THAT WILL BE PURSUING AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY FOCUSED ELEMENTS AND THROUGHOUT THE BLUEPRINT YOU'LL SEE A VERY STRONG EMPHASIS ON COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. THESE VARIOUS ELEMENTS INCLUDE FACTORS IN THE PROCESS FOR SELECTING COMMUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL FOCUSED ACTION. AND THEN IN THESE COMMUNITIES THE BLUEPRINT LAYS OUT THE CRITERIA FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING COMMUNITY ARE MONITORING PROGRAMS SO THAT THEY'RE DESIGNED TO INFORM SUBSEQUENT ACTION. AND THEN THE SCOPE AND PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. INCLUDING METRICS FOR TRACKING PROGRESS SO THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS AND ARE SEEING TANGIBLE IMPROVEMENTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME. GO. OUR BOARD ALSO SELECTED TEN INITIAL COMMUNITIES TO LAUNCH THE PROGRAM AND THE ORANGE DOTS ON THE SLIDE SHOW THOSE TEN COMMUNITIES AND THE CORRESPONDING AIR DISTRICTS ARE SHOWN IN BLUE. THIS INITIAL SAT ARE ALL HIGHLY BURDENS THEY HAVE A MIX OF URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES DIFFERENT KINDS OF AIR POLLUTION SOURCES AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITY SIZES BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE WHAT WE GET IS GIVE REFLECTION AND THE DIVERSITY OF POLLUTION CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THEN THE GOAL IS THAT STRATEGIES DEVELOPED IN THESE INITIAL SET OF COMMUNITIES PROVIDE MODELS FOR ACTION IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SIMILAR CHALLENGES. AND TO SUPPORT THAT WILL BE WORKING WITH THE ARE DISTRICTS TO IDENTIFY THOSE STRATEGIES THAT ARE WORKING AND THEN LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES ON HOW THOSE CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO A BROADER SET OF COMMUNITIES. THIS IS THE START OF A LARGER EFFORT AND WE DO EXPECT THAT THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES WILL GROW AS WE GROW THE PROGRAM OVER TIME. SO THEY ARE DISTRICTS ARE NOW WORKING WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES AND THIS IS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE ARE MONITORING AS WELL AS THE EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE SLIDE THE AIR MONITORING IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN JULY OF THIS YEAR. AND THEN AIR DISTRICTS NEED TO BRING THE COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS TO THEIR BOARDS BY OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS BUT A LOT OF WORK STILL AHEAD AND YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE FROM THE INDIVIDUAL AIR DISTRICTS AND THE COMMUNITY LEADERS. ABOUT THE WORK THAT IS UNDER WAY. SO WHAT I WANTED TO DO IN THE NEXT FEW IS HIGHLIGHT WHAT CARDS ON GOING ROLE IS -- AND MANY OF THE STATE WIDE EFFORTS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON SO CLEANING THE AIR IN THESE COMMUNITIES IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY OF BOTH CAR AND THE LOCAL AIRDISTRICTS AND EACH ELEMENT OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN REALLY REFLECTS THIS JOINT EFFORT. SO OUR ON GOING ROLE AS WE MOVE FORWARD INCLUDES A NUMBER OF CORE ACTIVITIES THERE SHOWN HERE ON THE SLIDE. AND THAT BEGINS WITH DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING NEW STATEWIDE STRATEGIES FOR MOBILE SOURCES AS WELL AS WORKING WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES SO WE CAN LEVERAGE THEIR RESOURCES AND INVESTMENTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THIS WORK SUPPORTS NOT ONLY THE TARGETED ACTION IN THE INITIAL TEN COMMUNITIES. BUT REALLY IMPORTANTLY REDUCING POLLUTION IN SIMILARLY BURDEN COMMUNITIES STATEWIDE. WE'RE ALSO DEVELOPING A NUMBER OF NEW TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION THAT'S REALLY NEEDED AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. AND THAT INCLUDES SITTING DOWN WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS -- TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE AND HOW THEY WANT TO BETTER ACCESS AND USE THIS INFORMATION. WE ALSO WORK WITH THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ON ADMINISTRATION OF THE INCENTIVE FUNDING. AND IF YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE FROM VERONICA IMPLEMENTING A BRAND NEW COMMUNITY AIR GRANT PROGRAM THAT FACILITATES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATION IN AB. SIX SEVENTEEN AND THEN FINALLY OUR BOARD HAS AN ONGOING ROLE INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND ANNUAL PROCESS FOR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES. LOOKING AT ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS AND MAKING ADJUSTMENTS AS NEEDED. SO STARTING WITH STATEWIDE STRATEGIES ARE REGULATORY EFFORTS REALLY PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR COMMUNITY LEVEL ACTION. AND MANY MEASURES OF ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR TRADITIONAL CRITERIA POLLUTANT TOXICS AND GREENHOUSE GAS PROGRAMS. AND THEN THE BLUEPRINT IDENTIFIES FURTHER ACTION SO THAT TOGETHER WE HAVE A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF REGULATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING TO OUR BOARD OVER THE CUP THE NEXT FEW YEARS. MANY OF THESE MEASURES WILL FOCUS ON ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FREIGHT SECTOR. AND IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR CONTINUING TO REDUCE LOCALIZED EXPOSURE UNDER AB. SIX SEVENTEEN IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR OUR BOARD IDENTIFIED RELATED ACTIONS INCLUDING THE REGULATIONS FOR SOURCES SUCH AS CLEAN OR CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT HARBOR CRAFTED DRAINAGE TRUCKS. ANOTHER ALSO OTHER MEASURES UNDER WAY TO REDUCE POLLUTION FROM VEHICLES LIKE THE CLEAN TRANSIT MEASURE THAT OUR BOARD ADOPTED LAST DECEMBER WHICH IS TRANSITIONING TRANSIT FLEETS TWO ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES. AND THEN FOR OTHER INDUSTRIAL SOURCES LIKE REFINERIES OR CEMENT PLANTS OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS. AIR DISTRICTS WILL BE UPDATING THE RULES TO REFLECT THE BEST AVAILABLE RETROFIT CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES ARE MARKED AS SHOWN ON THIS SLIDE. THE DISTRICTS OF RECENTLY ADOPTED SCHEDULES FOR THAT RULE MAKING AND MANY OF THOSE WILL MAKING EFFORTS ARE ALREADY UNDER WAY. THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORTED AB SIX SEVENTEEN BY PROVIDING NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS TO JUMP START EARLY REDUCTIONS IN THESE COMMUNITIES THROUGH TARGETED INCENTIVE FUNDING THAT COMPLEMENTS THE REGULATORY EFFORTS. THIS INCLUDED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN STATE BUDGET. AND THE MAP ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE SLIDE SHOWS THE ALLOCATION TO THE INDIVIDUAL AIR DISTRICTS WHICH IS SPECIFIED IN THE BUDGET BILL. AIR DISTRICTS HAVE BEGAN DISTRIBUTING THIS FUNDING FOR CLEANER TRUCKS BUSES OTHER MOBILE EQUIPMENT. AND EXAMPLE PROJECTS INCLUDE HYBRID GANTRY CRANES AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND ZERO EMISSION TRACKS IN THE SOUTH COAST IN ZERO MISSION SCHOOL BUSES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AMONGST OTHERS. THEN THE SECOND HALF OF THE FUNDS WAS PROVIDED IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET WHICH HAS NOW EXPANDED TO INCLUDE STATIONARY SOURCE TYPE PROJECTS. WERE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING GUIDELINES FOR THOSE NEW TYPES OF PROJECTS AND THAT INCLUDES DISCUSSIONS WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THESE GUIDELINES WILL BE CONSIDERED BY OUR BOARD NEXT MONTH. MOVING ON TO SOME OF THE OTHER TOOLS ARE WORKING ON EMISSIONS DATA IS VERY MUCH THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR STATE PROGRAMS. INCLUDING INFORMING EMISSION REDUCTION STRATEGIES AS WELL AS TRACKING PROGRESS OVER TIME. AB SIX SEVENTEEN AND AB -- ONE NINETY SEVEN THAT CAME BEFORE IT CALLED FOR ENHANCED EMISSIONS DATA REPORTING ALONG WITH GREATER ACCESS TO THE STATE OF BY COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THEIR DISTRICTS ON NEW EMISSION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND HEALTH SCIENTISTS ON THE SOURCE OF THE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND ESPECIALLY AIR TOXICS WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT OF MORE UNIFORM EMISSIONS REPORTING METHODOLOGIES. OUR STAFF BEGAN THIS PUBLIC PROCESS FOR THE REGULATION LAST SPRING AND WAS ADOPTED BY OUR BOARD IN DECEMBER. BUT AT THE DECEMBER BOARD MEETING OUR BOARD ALSO DIRECTED STAFF TO TAKE A BROADER FOCUS AND BETTER SUPPORT COMMUNITY LEVEL DATA THAT WE NEED FOR THE PROGRAM STATEWIDE. A FEW WEEKS AGO WE RELEASED DRAFT CHANGES THAT RESPONDED TO THAT DIRECTION. WE'VE ALSO JUST COMPLETED WORKSHOPS IN SACRAMENTO OAKLAND LA SAN DIEGO IN FRESNO TO GO OVER THE PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE. OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL BE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEIR DISTRICTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO FINALIZE THE REGULATION AND THAT WILL INCLUDE A FORMAL PROCESS FOR COMMENT ON THE PROPOSED CHANGES. SO ALONG WITH ENHANCED EMISSIONS DATA WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON A NUMBER OF EFFORTS TO BETTER SUPPORT COMMUNITY LEVEL AIR MONITORING. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF METHODS THAT CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLIGHTED HERE ON THIS SLIDE FROM SMALLER SENSORS TO MOBILE PLATFORMS TO SATELLITE DATA. THIS IS REALLY AN AN AREA OF RAPID EXPANSION AND INNOVATION AND COMMUNITY LED EFFORTS HAVE REALLY PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THIS. SO AS PART OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN WE ARE ASSESSING THE CAPABILITIES OF MANY OF THESE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES ALSO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SOUTH COAST WHICH HAS THEIR AQ SPEC PROGRAM. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE PRESENTATION WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS AND USE THIS INFORMATION ABOUT AIR QUALITY IN THEIR COMMUNITY. SO THIS SUMMER WE'RE GOING TO BE LAUNCHING A NEW WEBSITE IT'S CALLED H. Q. VIEW. AND THEN FINALLY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE BLUEPRINT ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR HOW TO DESIGN EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY ARE MONITORING NETWORK SO THEY REALLY CAN SUPPORT. A VARIETY OF ACTIONS FROM PROVIDING BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE BREATHING ON A REAL TIME BASIS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT SOURCES SO WE CAN BETTER TARGET UNDERSTAND HOW WE NEED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. AND THEN TO HOUSE ALL THIS INFORMATION WE'VE LAUNCHED AN ONLINE RESOURCE CENTER WHICH PROVIDES ONE LOCATION FOR AIR DISTRICTS COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO ACCESS THE MULTIPLE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THIS ALSO INCLUDES DEVELOPMENT OF A TECHNOLOGY CLEARING HOUSE WHICH PROVIDES INFORMATION ON CONTROL APPROACHES THAT ARE IN PRACTICE TODAY. BUT ALSO FORWARD LOOKING NEXT GENERATION KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES WHERE THERE MAY BE BENEFITS OF PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE FUNDING. THIS IS A FREE RESOURCE FOR BOTH AIR DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS THEIR DISTRICTS BEGIN DEVELOPING THEIR PARKING OF THE RULES. WILL BE CONTINUING TO UPDATE THIS RESOURCE CENTER AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE -- AND ALSO INCLUDING RESOURCES FAR COLLABORATING WITH LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES BEST PRACTICES AND INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH IMPACTS AND HEALTH STUDIES THAT ARE ONGOING. AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER. TO VERONICA TO CLOSE THE PRESENTATION. SO IF YOU'RE HURT AS YOU'VE HEARD BY NAMES FOR ANNIKA EDM THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE KAREN AND I HAVE WORKED REALLY CLOSELY AND IMPLEMENTING -- EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN INVOLVEMENT HAVE BEEN AT THE HEART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM. MANY COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS WE ROLLED OUT THE PROGRAM -- AT PROVIDED SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING OUR OUTREACH -- IT WAS CLEAR IN FACT THAT ENGAGING. WITH THESE COMMUNITIES REQUIRED NEW APPROACHES AND NOT JUST OUR TRADITIONAL DAYTIME WORKSHOPS. SO SOME OF THE NEW APPROACHES INCLUDED -- CREATING AT A NEW CONSULTATION GROUP WHICH IS A BROAD RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS AND IS CHAIRED BY ONE OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS -- WE PARTICIPATED IN LEGISLATIVE TOWN HALLS AND OF COURSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARTUCCI -- WAS ONE OF THE LEGISLATORS WHO OPENED THE DOORS FOR US TO MEET WITH HIS CONSTITUENTS. AND THEN A NUMBER OF EVENING MEETINGS AS WELL. BUT IT ISN'T ABOUT ONLY ABOUT FINDING NEW WAYS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER IT WAS ABOUT HAVING REAL CONVERSATION SOME OF THEM DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS -- WITH RESIDENTS TO SHARE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCES -- MANY OF THE LOCAL GROUPS INVITED US ON TOWARDS OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT WAS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR US -- TO BE ABLE TO EXT THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AS THEY SEE THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND WE WERE REALLY. FORTUNATE TO HAVE RICHARD ON A NUMBER OF THOSE STORIES WITH US -- MANY OF THE LOCAL GROUPS -- AS I SAID -- EXPLAIN TO THEIR FIRST HAND PROBLEMS AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS -- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO THIS PARTICULARLY AS WE NOT JUST -- SELECT NEW COMMUNITIES IDENTIFY NEW COMMUNITIES THAT WILL BE A BE SIX ONE SEVEN COMMUNITIES. BUT ALSO. THE THROUGHOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION IN THESE FIRST YEARS IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THE BOARD DESIGNATED -- SAU. WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTING COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT THROUGH FUNDING -- PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR GRANTS PROGRAM FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WE CALL THAT THAT COMMUNITY AIR GRANTS. THIS MAP SHOWS THE FIRST TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE AWARDED TO TWENTY FIVE COMMUNITY GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE -- AS WELL AS THREE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. THE GRANTS PROVIDE FUNDING FOR GROUPS TO PARTICIPATE IN A LOCAL COMMUNITY ARE PROTECTION PROCESS SO IN SOME CASES IT'S SHARING INFORMATION AND BUILDING CASES IT'S A BUILDING CAPACITY WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES USING A NUMBER OF APPROACHES. SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED HERE IN -- VENTURE A DEAR ACTION TEAMS LED BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO HELP DOCUMENT AIR POLLUTION SOURCES -- ALL ABOUT WILL HELP US IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB -- SIX ONE SEVEN IN FRESNO THERE ARE SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO WILL LEARN HOW TO IDENTIFY UNHEALTHY AIR QUALITY ISSUES. AND IN EAST LA RESIDENTS WILL LEARN ABOUT THE LONG TERM PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS OF AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURE AND AIR POLLUTION REDUCTION -- IN. HI EAST LA THIS IS A PARTICULARLY -- IMPLEMENTED OUT OF PUBLIC HOUSING DEVELOPMENT -- WE ARE EXPECTING TO HAVE A TO ALLOCATE THE ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE LEFT. DURING AS SECOND SOLICITATION THAT WILL ROLL OUT IN THE COMING MONTHS -- AND ANNOUNCING THE WORD AT THE GRANT SOMETIME THIS SUMMER. ANOTHER KEY PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB SIX ONE SEVEN ANOTHER CORE PIECE OF IT IS THAT COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES -- THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP IN CONTINUING ENGAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THIS PROGRAM. THE AIR DISTRICTS HAVE CAN BE AND COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MONITORING PLANS. AND THAT INCLUDES -- DETERMINING WHERE THE MONEY -- LOCATED IN THAT OF COURSE IN PUTTING TOGETHER THE COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. THESE COMMITTEES BRING TOGETHER A BROAD GROUP TO THE TABLE. DRAWN FROM EACH SELECTED COMMUNITY WITH PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE -- WITH PEOPLE THAT BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITY AND THE PUBLICATION SEES THAT GOVERN LOCAL POLICIES -- AND IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE LOCAL AGENCIES SO THAT WERE ABLE -- TO ADOPT PROGRAMS THAT ALSO. MIGHT INCLUDE LOCAL LAND USES AND OTHER THINGS -- OTHER TOOLS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY WITHIN OUR AUTHORITY OR THE FORTY THE AIR DISTRICT. THE STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP -- IS PRIMARILY COMMUNITY RESIDENTS SO A MAJORITY OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS THAT REPRESENT VOICES FROM ACROSS THE COMMUNITY. THESE COMMITTEES ARE WORKING WITH THE AIR DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS FROM DISCUSSING -- MONITORING NEEDS IDENTIFYING STRATEGIES THAT REDUCE POLLUTION AND ALSO TRACKING PROGRESS IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE METRICS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT THE EXTENT OF WORK GOING ON WITH THESE COMMITTEES OF COURSE FOR BOTH FROM THE AIR DISTRICTS WHO ARE HERE TODAY AND AS WELL AS STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO LOOKING FORWARD -- AS WE LOOK AHEAD THERE ARE MANY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS -- IN COMMUNITIES IN THE AIR DISTRICTS. TO ACTIONS THAT WILL REDUCE EMISSIONS AND EXPOSURES. WILL ALSO WORK WITH COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP THE TOOLS NEEDED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND POLLUTION SOURCES. AND DOCUMENT AIR QUALITY IMPACTS. THIS WILL BE AN ONGOING EFFORT THAT WILL INVOLVE AS WE LEARN ADJUSTED. BASED ON THE INITIAL YEARS OF THE PROGRAM. OUR BOARD HAS AN ONGOING ROLE OF COURSE INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES AND THE PROPOSAL OF THE COMMUNITY READ EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM SUBMITTED BY THE AIR DISTRICTS. LATER ON THIS YEAR WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE -- BOTH THROUGH LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE REPORTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH INDIVIDUAL LEGISLATORS OUGHT TO ADDRESS CONCERNS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES ALL OF THESE EFFORTS WILL CONTINUE TO SHAPE THE PROGRAM AND PROVIDE. THE CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION THAT IS NEEDED. THANK YOU AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU AND A CONGRATULATIONS ON STAYING WITHIN THE ALLOTTED TIMEFRAME I THINK YOU WERE AN EXEMPLARY GROUP SETTING REALLY EXAMPLE. INTO GROUPS YET TO COME SO THANK YOU -- BEFORE I ASK MY QUESTIONS I WILL MOVE TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SEE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY. QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA FIVE THAT USE ANY TALK ABOUT CARBS ONGOING ROLES AND YOU. I MIGHT HAVE [inaudible] IT'S OKAY. I'M SORRY. IN A EASE AT THAT THERE'S CARBS ONGOING ROLAND. YOU OUTLINED FIVE ROLLS AND THAT THE WHAT I DIDN'T SEE ON THAT WAS YOUR ROLE AND HELPING THE AREA THE LOCAL OR DISTRICTS ARE HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE. THE IDEA IS THAT HOT SPOTS HER THEIR FRIENDS IN THE COMMUNITY TOOLS THE NEEDS WE HAVE ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT AND WE WANT THEM TO BE TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUAL THANKS AND SO WE DON'T EXPECT TO SEE. A REPLICA OF A SYSTEM ACROSS THE BOARD BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S EQUITABLE SPECIALLY IN THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PIECE THAT EVER REALLY FULLY IT EXEMPLIFIES WHAT WE WANTED AND THAT WE ARE NOT JUST DOING. MONITORING THAT WE'RE GOING WELL BEYOND THAT AND THAT -- THE COMMUNITY HAS TO SAY AND IT'S A PARTNERSHIP AND NOT JUST BEING TOLD AND SO HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR ROLE IN IN THIS PROCESS AND AND FOR ME THIS WAS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE FIRST TEN COMMUNITIES ARE WHO ARE LEARNING FROM WHEN WILL BE THE BLUEPRINT MOVING FORWARD. YES ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA. THE ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION AS YOU NOTED IS KEY TO THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM IS IT ARE THE REAL REDUCTIONS BE REALIZED. AND REDUCED EXPOSURE. THE COMMUNITY OF EMISSION REDUCTION PLAN THE BOARDS ARE BOARDS CONSIDERATION OF THE PLAN IS REALLY A TOUCH POINT A START. THE AMPLE WILL REQUIRE ONGOING WORK THAT WE WILL BE DOING WITH THE DISTRICTS WITH THE COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF BECAUSE THERE'S M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; FOR MOBILE AND&lt;/c&gt;</u> STATIONARY MEASURES AND INCENTIVES THAT ARE EMBEDDED IN IN THOSE ELEMENTS. IN AN ELEMENT IN THE BURKE BLUEPRINT THAT YOU TOUCHED ON WAYS IN ANNUAL UPDATE IN TERMS OF STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION SO A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM. IS NOT ONLY THE INVENTORY WHERE THE EMISSIONS COMING FROM IS ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS. WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME FOR THOSE COMMITMENTS AND AN ANNUAL? STATUS REPORT ON PROGRESS RELATIVE THE PLAN IN A PUBLIC POSTING OF THAT. THE ANNUAL UPDATE AN ONGOING WORK WITH DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITIES THERE'S GOING TO BE. IT REALLY IS A KEY ELEMENT TO THE ALTIMA EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM. IS THERE A ROLE FOR YOU AS THE IT'S THAT THE AS A STEERING COMMITTEES ARE MEETING -- IS THERE A ROLE FOR YOU IN ANY OF THIS PROCESS. NOW I KNOW THAT THEIR MEETING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT IS THERE A ROLE FOR YOU NOW WHAT DO YOU SEE THAT ROLE FOR YOURSELF. IF THERE IS. ONE SO WE'VE BEEN -- STAFFING THOSE DURING COMMITTEES SO -- KAREN IS AT HER STOP THEIR WE'VE HAD STAFF FOR MONITORING LABORATORY DIVISION AND A MARBLE JUSTICE STAFF IN THERE -- THAT WE HEAR IGGY AGING IN BETWEEN STEERING COMMITTEE MEETINGS WITH -- AJ GROUPS AND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS WHO WANT TO ENGAGE WITH US SO IN SOME OF THE DISTRICTS WE'VE HAD QUITE A BIT OF CONTACT EVEN JUST TODAY WE HAD A MEETING WITH -- CALIFORNIA VITAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE SO WE'RE KEEPING THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN AND WE'RE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS AS WE NEED [inaudible] TO IF -- I HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS BUT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA STICK AROUND FOR THE FIRST THE PRESENTATION I THINK I'LL LET. SO I THINK IT'LL BE BASED ON WHAT I HEAR FROM THE GROUPS WILL WILL BE HERE -- BUT I I'VE BEEN I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO FOLKS AND AS EXPECTED DIFFERENCE DURING COMMITTEES ARE IN DIFFERENT PROCESS THIS AND AND I COULD HAVE SOME PATIENCE FOR FOR THAT DIFFERENCE. BUT THERE IS FRUSTRATION OF LOCALLY. FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHERE THIS AND PHYLLIS COLLABORATIVE AN EXPECTATION OF FOOD THEN STEPPED IN TO HELP THEM BE MORE COLLABORATIVE IS THAT YOUR ROLE. AND AT THAT I MEAN IN MY EYES IT'S YOUR OWN BUT A IT'S NOT CLEAR WHOSE ROLE IS TO HELP MAKE THE SWITCH IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A KEY ROLE IN TERMS OF NOT ONLY THE WORK WITH THE DISTRICTS. THE WORK WITH THE COMMUNITIES AND TO VERONICA'S POINT IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE'VE ATTENDED AND WILL CONTINUE TO ATTEND THE STEERING COMMITTEE SO WE ARE ENGAGED. AWARE HOW THINGS ARE PROCEED WE ALL OF US COLLECTIVELY WANT TO BE CONFIDENT. THAT THE COMMUNITY THAT THE MISSION REDUCTION PLAN THAT THE BOARD ULTIMATELY CONSIDERS. IS EFFECTIVE AND WORKS IN A SOLID AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE WAY TO DO THAT IS BEING GAUGE FROM THE GET GO. AND NOT A ONLY FOR BOARDS CONSIDERATION OF PLAN REALLY THROUGHOUT ITS IMPLEMENTATION. AND IF I COULD JUST ADD -- SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE EACH -- STEERING COMMITTEE ACROSS THE REGION AND IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BASED ON THEIR COMPOSITION AND THEIR CULTURE AND AND SO KAREN AND I HAVE BEEN -- AS I SAID MEETING WITH PEOPLE BUT ALSO PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT THE NEEDS OF THOSE STEERING COMMITTEES ARE -- SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW -- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE PEOPLE ARE UP AGAINST A FOR A REALLY TIGHT CLOCK. AND I'VE EXPERIENCED A DIFFERENCE OF THE US DURING COMMITTEES WHERE -- SOME OF THAT MEMBERS OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE A DEPTH OF UNDER SO. WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE INTERNAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROVIDE THE TOOLS THAT THE STEERING COMMITTEE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE AT THEIR JOBS AND SO OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR AND ESPECIALLY AS WE SEE MORE COMMUNITIES COMING ONLINE. I THINK WE WILL BE DOING SOME COURSE ADJUSTMENTS SO THAT WE CAN BE -- SUPPORT FOR THEM. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND CHECK OFFICE WELL THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE I HE WALKED IN. A COUPLE MINUTES LATE SO I'M NOT SURE IF YOU ALREADY ADDRESSED ISSUES -- BUT LOOKING AT THE STATUE THE STATUTE BE SOCIALLY BECAUSE FOR SOME ARMED BASICALLY HIGH LEVEL KIND OF ALL COMPLAINTS -- THE DIAL IS ACTUALLY SO COOL FIRST QUESTION IS ARE A WE BASICALLY ON TRACK AS FAR AS THE TIME LINES ARE ARE CONCERNED AS FAR AS IMPLEMENTING EACH STEP OF THE OF THE GAME PLAN. WE ARE ON TRACK BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE WHEN I SAY THAT THIS PROGRAMS VERY COMPREHENSIVE VERY AMBITIOUS AND ALL THOSE OLD SAID THIS TABLE BEHIND ME. YOU ARE COMMITTED TO PAYING ATTENTION TO HELP PLACE OUT BUT JUST TO DIRECTLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. THERE ARE A NUMBER DATES THAT WERE CALLED OUT FOR THE FIRST YEAR IN TERMS OF A COMMUNITY A PLAN THAT THE TEMPLATE FOR DEVELOPING COMMUNITY BE SURE REDUCTION PLANTS. A PLAN FOR AIR QUALITY MONITORING THE DISTRICT'S SCHEDULE FOR BARKED. ALL THOSE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED AND THEY'VE HAPPEN ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULE BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT REALIZING. THERE'S MUCH MUCH WORK AHEAD OF US BUT WE ARE ALL THE STATUTORY DATES AT RECALL THAT WE MET THOSE CUTS I NOTICED THAT THE TEN REGIONS HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND ALSO YOU MENTION JUST MENTIONED ABOUT THE MONITORING PLAN. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CLEARING HOUSE THAT BASICALLY IDENTIFIES THE VARIOUS ALL PATERNITY OF SO TECHNOLOGY ALTERNATIVES -- TO COMBAT THE SITUATION HAS NOT ALSO BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR AT LEAST DESIGNED YES SO -- LAST SEPTEMBER WE ACTUALLY LAUNCHED AN INITIAL VERSION OF THE CLEARING HOUSE SO IT CAN SUPPORT THE EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW. BUT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS WELL AS AIR DISTRICTS ON HOW WE CAN FURTHER ENHANCE THAT AND ACTUALLY HAVE A CONTRACT UNDER WAY -- TO FURTHER ENHANCE THAT -- AND MAKE IT THE INFORMATION EVEN MORE USER FRIENDLY AND ACCESSIBLE AND THAT WILL BE COMING OUT PROBABLY IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR. SO THAT'S WHEN WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A WRITTEN REPORT OF SORTS IT WOULD ANA. WE CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE ONGOING REPORTS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THAT IN THE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE WITHIN THE CLEARING HOUSE WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND IT OVER TIME YEAH I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER THERE'S A WRITTEN REPORT ON THE OVERALL -- PROGRESS OF THE OF THE THE IMPLEMENTATION THEY'RE NOT WHEN WE GONNA GET TO SEE THAT IF AT ALL IN THE NEXT FUTURE -- IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE A KEY POINT WILL BE LATE THIS YEAR I WILL BE AFTER THE DISTRICTS BRING BEFORE THEIR BOARDS. THE INITIAL COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM SO THEIR BOARDS BY A OCTOBER ONE WILL BE CONSIDERING THOSE PLANS. AFTER THAT THEY'LL BE TRANSMITTING THOSE PLANS TO CALL OUR FOR WITHIN A SIXTY DAY PERIOD FOR CONSIDERATION REVIEW APPROVAL. THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER GOOD TOUCH POINT WILL BE BRIEFING OUR BOARD IN TERMS OF A TOUCH POINT IN TERMS THE STATUS OF THE PROGRAM. THAT BE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEF YOU AS WELL. THANKS VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS -- FIRST YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT MOBILE SOURCES AND PARTICULARLY DIESEL ARE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO A LOT OF THESE COMMUNITIES -- HOW HOW WAS CARP GOING TO USE ITS AUTHORITY -- TO REDUCE THE POLLUTION FROM THE SOURCES AND IS IT ALL THROUGH THE GRANT PROGRAM OR DO YOU HAVE OTHER -- STRATEGIES THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING EMPLOYING AND THEN THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION IS ARE THERE OTHER STRATEGIES THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING IN YOUR VIEW. WE HAVE FROM A CONTROL STANDPOINT SHEESH THE INITIAL RESPONSE IS NOT ON SENATE'S IMPACT IT'S HEAVILY FOCUSED ON REGULATION. WE ARE THE MOST. THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF MOBILE SOURCE HEAVY DUTY REGULATIONS THEY WERE WORKING ON THAT WE COMMITTED TO IN THE HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION. AND REALLY THOSE REGULATIONS BE THEY HEAVY TRUCKS BE THE DELIVERY TRUCKS TRANSIT BUSES. SCHOOL BUSES T. R. USE A REFRIGERATED TRAILERS THAT RUN ON DIESEL. THESE ARE TRANSITIONING EACH OF THOSE TWO ELECTRIFICATION SO THE COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION SOME OF WHICH WE ALREADY BROUGHT TO THE BOARD SOME WILL GO TO THE BOARD THIS YEAR. AND SOME IN THE NEXT YEAR TWO OR TWO THREE YEARS. VERY COMPREHENSIVE REALLY PHASE OUT OF COMBUSTION. AND REGULATIONS IN OUR MIND AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ARE A KEY ELEMENT IN GETTING THEIR INCENTIVE TO HELP MOVE THINGS FORWARD. THE BIGGER CHALLENGE AND THIS IS JUST A ONE THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH THIS AN ORGANIZATION. IS ONE WERE ONE EFFORT IS THE TIGHTER STANDARDS MOVING THIS YEAR THAT I TALKED ABOUT. THE OTHER ISSUE IS. ZERO THE DIESEL EQUIPMENT THAT'S ON THE ROAD TODAY. THE LAST FOR DECADES. AND WE HAVE A TRUCK AND BUS READ BUT WE HAVE A MANY OTHER -- IT HEAVY DUTY PIECES OF EQUIPMENT THAT COULD LAST FOR THE NEXT FEW DECADES THE CHALLENGES. I DO WHAT WORLD INCENTIVES PLAY AND INCENTIVES HAVE BEEN HELPFUL ABOUT MOVING THAT DIRTY QUITMAN OUT AND REPLACING. IT WITH THE CLEANEST ZERO MISSION TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE AND IN SOME OF THAT EQUIPMENT IS OWNED BY. SINGLE OWNER OPERATORS LOWER INCOME FOLKS. THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE HOW DO YOU EXPEDITE THE TURNOVER OF THE EXISTING DIRTY FLEET AT THE SAME TIME YOUR TIGHTENING STANDARDS FOR THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AND TRYING TO EXPEDITE THE TURNOVER WITH INCENTIVES BUT INCENTIVES WILL NEVER COVER ALL THAT. THAT THAT'S A YOU ISSUE OUR BOARD AND WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON RIGHT NOW TRYING TO WORK THROUGH. THANKS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF EMISSIONS ARE THERE IS THERE A CENTRAL LISTING OF ALTERNATIVES. FOR JUST FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF EMISSION SOURCES ON THE ON THE MOBILE SIDE WHAT WE'VE DONE BECAUSE MOBILE SOURCE ON HEAVY DUTY. IT'S EXCEEDINGLY COMPLEX IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF SOURCES. OF A FORKLIFT IS DIFFERENT THAN A PIECE OF CARGO HIM THE EQUIPMENT IS DIFFERENT THAN A CLASS SIX ROCKETS DIFFERENT THAN A CLASS EIGHT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS PREPARE TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS. FOR EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES OF HEAVY DUTY AND IN TERMS OF WHAT'S AVAILABLE IS ZERO AVAILABLE TODAY ONE OF THE EMISSIONS SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE POSTED AND IT REALLY IS A PREAMBLE. THAT WORK TO THE REGULATORY WORK THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING SO THAT IS ON OUR WEBSITE -- I I'M NOT SAYING IT'S ALWAYS IS USER FRIENDLY THESE ARE DETAILED TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS. AND THEN -- IN TERMS OF THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WHAT WAS THE CRITERIA AND HOW IT HOW DID YOU BASE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WITH THE THRESHOLDS BASED ON AND HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO IMPACT THAT. TO JUDGE THE IMPACTS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH -- WITH A LACK OF SORT OF PRIOR DATA. SO IN AND I THINK THE EMISSIONS REPORTING YEAH REGULATION SO WE'VE TAKEN SORT OF A TIERED APPROACH -- IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS -- IN THE REGULATION AND IT'S REALLY BASED ON THE PRIOR WORK -- THAT IS BEING DONE LOOKING -- FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT AND THE SCIENCE AND THE HEALTH INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT CRITERIA POLLUTANTS PM KNOCKS -- WE ARE NOW PROPOSING UP A THRESHOLD FOR PERMITTED SOURCES THAT EMIT MORE THAN TEN TONS PER YEAR AND THAT'S A A PRETTY CONSISTENT THRESHOLD WHEN YOU GET TO TALK SIX OF COURSE IT BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE HEALTH IMPACTS ARE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT. SO FOR A NUMBER OF KEY AIR TOXICS WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT REPORTING OF ALL SOURCES FOR THOSE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE HEX CHROM COMING FROM FROM PLAYERS ETCETERA. AND THEN FOR OTHER KINDS OF SOURCES -- IT'S STARTING TO LOOK AT ADDITIONAL THRESHOLDS FOR THIS AND THEN PART OF THIS IS ALSO LOOKING AT RECOGNIZING THIS IS A A LOT OF DATA THAT WILL NEED TO BE COLLECTING OVERTIME. WORKING TO PHASE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REPORTING REGULATION IN OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AS WELL. THANK YOU AND LAST MY LAST QUESTION FOR NOW IS WHAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE ON THE BEST AVAILABLE RETROFIT CONTROL TECHNOLOGY DATABASE. SO -- THAT'S THE TERMINOLOGY I WAS USING FOR THE TECHNOLOGY CLEARING HOUSE SO THAT WAS WHAT WE LAUNCHED AS AN INTERIM VERSION AND THEN WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK TO ENHANCE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DATA INTO THAT AND EVENTUALLY ALSO INCORPORATE NOT ONLY STATIONARY SOURCE BUT MOBILE SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL. RIGHT THANK YOU THAT IS FINE -- SAY THAT WE'VE JUST BEEN JOINED BY SOME MEMBERS WHOSE EGGMAN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- Là IS ANYBODY HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA. I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION WE WE HAVE STE AND ACTION PLANS THAT WILL BE COMING DOWN EVENTUALLY -- AND THE AIR BE. WILL BE LOOKING AT THOSE ACTION PLANS AND DECIDING THIS IS GOOD THIS IS BAD I JUST MISS HOW ARE YOU GUYS PREPARING TO REVIEW THOSE AND GIVE THEM PUT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE STEERING. PLANTS. LOOK GOOD. RIGHT AND BRANKA MAY WANT TO ADD TO THIS BUT GETS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER A POINT I MADE EARLIER WHICH IS. THE OCTOBER ONE DEADLINE IS THE DATE BY WHICH THE DISTRICT WOULD ACT ON THE COMMUNITY'S MISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM. IF EVEN THE HEAD OF THAT LAST YEAR WAS THE BILL WHAT WE'RE REFERRING IS THE BLUEPRINT WHICH WAS WHAT IS THE BENCHMARK TO ASSESS INEFFECTIVE COMMITTEE WHO JOSH REDUCTION PLAN SO IT LAID OUT [inaudible] SUBSTANTIAL CRITERIA THAT WOULD BE USED TO JUDGE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF A COMMUNITY REDUCTION PLAN. WE COULD PROMOTE CONSISTENCY AND QUALITY THE OTHER ELEMENT. WAS ENGAGEMENT THAT VERONICA MENTION AT THE STEERING COMMITTEE SO THAT WE'RE NOT WAITING TO SEE A AL SOLVE THE PLAN IS THAT WE CAN FALL WITH A LONG AND ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS OF THE REALLY -- PARTS PRICES WE HAVE DESCRIBED MUCH MORE TO ADD BUT THE STEERING COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN I MEAN I AM AND ALL OF THEM BUT I'VE BEEN. TO QUITE A NUMBER OF THEM AND IT'S BEEN A REALLY HELPFUL TO EXPERIENCE THE PROGRESS AS IT UNFOLDS -- YOU'LL HEAR OF COURSE FROM -- WEST OAKLAND REBEL INDEED INDICATORS PROJECT MISS MARGARET GORDON -- AS WELL AS IN THE AIR DISTRICT THERE REALLY FARTHER ALONG THAN ANYBODY ELSE IS IN THE PROCESS. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF LESSONS TO BE LEARNED I THINK FROM WEST OAKLAND AS THE OTHER. COMMUNITIES BEGIN TO COME ALONG. SO DO YOU EXPECT THAT. NOW THAT YOU'RE ON THE GROUND IN YOUR AT TEN THE IN THE STEERING COMMITTEES THAT YOUR BLUE PRATT MIGHT CHANGE [inaudible] FORTY SO THE THE STATUTE SAYS THAT YOU KNOW AT A MINIMUM WE WOULD NEED TO UPDATE THE BLUEPRINT WITHIN FIVE YEARS. I THINK CERTAINLY AS YOU'VE HEARD BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A BRAND NEW PROGRAM AND WE'RE ALL LEARNING AND GROWING THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BLUEPRINT MUCH EARLIER THAN THE FIVE YEAR TIME FRAME SINCE WE'RE LEARNING SO MUCH THIS YEAR. THANK YOU ACTUALLY I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION BEFORE I MOVED TO MY COLLEAGUES -- ON YOUR SLIDE NINE YOU SHOULD AN AIR TOXICS MONITOR AND I'M WONDERING IF A OR B. OR ANY OTHER THEY ARE DISTRICT US DEPLOYED ANY. THEIR TOXIC MONITORS PURSUANT TO AB SIX SEVENTEEN AND IF SO IF THAT A MISSION ST IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND WHERE THAT WOULD BE. SO THERE IS A A ROUTINE. AIR TOXICS NETWORK ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT WE IN THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS HAVE HISTORICALLY -- OPERATED WHAT TAP IS THROUGH THE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES -- THE AIR DISTRICTS ARE WORKING WITH THOSE COMMITTEES TO IDENTIFY WHAT KIND OF THINGS WE WANT TO MONITOR FOR AND THE MOST APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGIES. AND I THINK YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM SOME OF THE AIR DISTRICTS TODAY WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT BUT WE DO KNOW THAT AIR TOXICS IS ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THAT AND SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHICH KINDS OF APPROACHES THEY'LL BE USING -- AND HOW TO MAKE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS SEPTEMBER. I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION ON IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STATIONARY SOURCES ARE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF BOTH THE COUNTY AS WELL AS THE A. R. B. -- STILL IS IT CORRECT TO SAY THAT --% STATIONARY SOURCES IS REALLY NOTHING NEW AS FAR AS COLLECTING DATA ABOUT STATIONARY SOURCES. FROM -- FROM THE A ARBY'S PERSPECTIVE WOULD THAT BE A CORRECT STATEMENT. FROM AN OVERALL AFFORD THESE AIR QUALITY AUTHORITY STANDPOINT IT'S THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE PERMITTING AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. OVER STATIONARY SOURCES STATUTORY SEVENTEEN IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE A A RP IS KIND OF DOING A STATIONARY SOURCES OR WELL FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM. SIX SEVENTEEN RECOGNIZED THE KEY ROLE OF BOTH THE STATE CARB ANY ARE DISTRICTS AND REALIZE THAT YOU COULD AND CLEARLY THE COMMUNITIES IN REAL RECOGNIZE THAT. YOU COULD EFFECTIVELY LEAD TO A EFFECTIVE EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM WITHOUT CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN BOTH THOSE PLAYERS. THANK YOU SOME OF OUR FLOOR. THANK YOU FOR A JOINT US IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT TO SAY HERE LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY FROM. FROM EVERYBODY BUT I THERE IS A COUPLE WORDS I'VE HEARD -- THROUGHOUT THIS IS PARTNERSHIP. YEAH WE HEAR THAT A LOT RIGHT NOW AND I'M ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS -- BECAUSE AS WAS STATED YOU KNOW FROM OUR MY COLLEAGUES. WE START PAINTING IN BROAD BRUSHES IN THE STATE. IT DOESN'T WORK AT TIMES BECAUSE ALL OF OUR INDIVIDUAL OR DISTRICTS HAVE UNIQUE CHALLENGES WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. I REPRESENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SO WE HAVE A LARGE AG REGION. AS I'M JUST CURIOUS -- IN IN INTO THE BECAUSE I'M A BIG FAN OF THE CARROT VERSES A STICK APPROACH. I THINK -- THE COMMUNITIES THEY RESPOND TO INCENTIVES AND IT'S CERTAINLY COMING FROM AN AG BACKGROUND. OR THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WORKING. AND IF NOT WHAT CAN WE DO TO BOLSTER THOSE TO GET MORE OF THESE -- TRACTORS -- UTILITY VEHICLES SEMIS THAT WERE THAT WERE DESPERATELY TRYING TO REMOVE. HOW CAN WE BOTH BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND IF THEY'RE NOT WORKING WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE THOSE BETTER AND SOLIDIFY THEIR SUCCESS? YEAH I'LL I'LL BRIEFLY SPEAK TO THIS IS REALLY A BROADER RESPONSE IN THE VALLEY THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT HAD PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE FARMER WHICH IS. AS WELL AS MORE YEAR HISTORICAL TRACTOR REPLACEMENTS THIRTY TRUCK REPLACEMENTS FROM A KEY METRIC IN TERMS OF DIESEL EMISSION REDUCTIONS. COST EFFECTIVENESS A TRACK RECORD OF EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION IS A SET OF PROGRAMS MANY OF WHICH BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE DECADE DECADES IN SOME CASES. DEPENDING EXCEEDINGLY AFFECTED THE ISSUE IS THEIR SUBSTANTIALLY OVERSUBSCRIBED. THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH FUNDING BUT FOR THE FUNDING HAS BEEN APPROPRIATE IN AVAILABLE THEY WORK IN THERE'S ESTABLISHED TRACK RECORD THAT THEY DO JUST THAT. THAT'S AWESOME I MEAN I KNOW JUST LIKE IN THE FORMER PROGRAM YOU KNOW AS I KNOW WHAT THE BOARD RECOMMENDED WHICH I'M INCREDIBLY -- EXCITED ABOUT YOU KNOW YOUR PROPOSAL YOU WITHIN THE BUDGET IT GOT WHACKED YOU KNOW PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL AND YOU WILL HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TALK OFF LINE. BUT I AM EXCITED ABOUT THAT THE DISTRICT THIS TO WORK WITH ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW AND CERTAINLY FROM MY OFFICE IN THE AREA THAT WE REPRESENT HOWEVER WE CAN BE. HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THE THE AG INDUSTRY IS READY AND WILLING -- WITH THE PROPER AMOUNT INCENTIVES AND I KNOW THAT MOVING FORWARD. JUSTIN THIS YEAR ALONE WE GOT LIKE TWENTY SIX HUNDRED TRACTORS IN THE QUEUE. AND THAT FUNDING NUMBER IS NOT THERE AND IT IS A BIG NUMBER AS WE GET INTO THESE THESE CLEANER ADMISSIONS ARMIES CLEANER ENGINES. THAT PRICE GOES THROUGH THE ROOF PER UNIT. AND SO THIS FUNDING SOURCES A HUGE CONCERN OF ALL OF OUR SEPARATE FUTURE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER CITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WONDER MAKE SURE I DIDN'T. TO MESS -- ANY OF YOUR EXPLANATION AS TO HOW THE THE TEN INITIAL COMMUNITIES -- WERE WERE SELECTED -- I I SEE AND SOME OF THE MATERIALS THAT WERE. DISTRIBUTED BY THE COMMITTEE THAT -- ONE OF THE CORE CRITERIA WAS POVERTY LEVELS -- BUT I I WANT TO KNOW. YOU KNOW IN MY DISTRICT I I REPRESENT -- THE CITY OF TORRANCE WHICH HAS A A LARGE REFINERY -- THE THAT IS -- SURROUNDED BY A DENSE ID -- SUBURBAN MIDDLE CLASS LARGELY MIDDLE CLASS COMMUNITIES AND SO -- HOW HOW WOULD? TO YOU KNOW -- COMMUNITIES LIKE TORRANCE -- BE BE COVERED BY -- THE PROVISIONS AB [inaudible] SIX SEVENTEEN SO WE SET OUT -- IN THE BEGINNING SOME BROAD CRITERIA THAT WE ASKED THEM LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS WORKING WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR REGION. TO LOOK AT IN THAT IN COLLUDED OF COURSE JUST UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU'RE POLLUTION LEVELS WERE IN THE COMMUNITY -- BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE SOCIO ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT INCREASE VULNERABILITY TO AIR POLLUTION SUCH AS POVERTY AT CETERA -- AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT HEALTH IMPACTS THAT WE KNOW ARE OFTEN VERY CLOSELY RELATED TO AIR POLLUTION HEART ATTACKS PREMATURE BIRTH RESPIRATORY DISEASE -- AND THEN THEY WORK THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS TO WEIGH ALL OF THOSE AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO US FOR COMMUNITIES THAT THEY THOUGHT WOULD REALLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF. OF AND FROM THAT SET WE THEN RECOMMENDED TO OUR BOARD THAT TEN COMMUNITIES THAT YOU SEE HERE -- TODAY TO BEGIN THE PROGRAM RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OTHER COMMUNITIES -- THAT REALLY HAVE SIMILAR CHALLENGES AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT ONE THAT WE HAVE THESE BROUGHT STATEWIDE STRATEGIES THAT ARE ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS AND THEN TO AS I MENTIONED. THAT AS WE IDENTIFY THINGS THAT ARE WORKING IN THESE COMMUNITIES REALLY LOOK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW THEY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED ELSEWHERE. SO IT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SAY THAT TO YOU YOU LOOKED AT THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE YOU WOULD HAVE THE THE GREATEST IMPACT I MEAN IS IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT -- THAT -- BE CLEAR THAT THE COMMUNITIES THE THAT YOU WERE SELECTED WITH THE HIGHEST. POVERTY LEVELS ALSO HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF AIR POLLUTION. AND GENERAL IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THESE THEY ALL HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF AIR POLLUTION IN THE REGION THEY ARE ALL -- HEAVILY BURDENED IN TERMS OF THE SOCIO AND ECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS THE KIND OF HEALTH IMPACTS THAT WE SEE. IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. ONE POINT I'D LIKE TO ADD TO THIS RESPONSE I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT. THAT IS MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF SIX SEVENTEEN GO BEYOND JUST THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SELECTED THE BARK PROVISIONS WOULD CERTAINLY PICK UP THE REFINERY. THE INVENTORY PROVISIONS THE INCENTIVES. THAT WERE PROVIDED SO AS WELL AS IN THIS CARE MENTION THE RAGS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AND DEVELOPING SO. ALTHOUGH THERE CLERK CLEARLY FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES WERE SELECTED THERE NEEDS TO BE A FOCUSED EFFORT FROM IMPLEMENTATION LESSONS LEARNED WE CAN MULTIPLY APPLY TO OTHERS. BUT THE INTERNET WILL BE ACTIONS% ACROSS THE STATE AND MANY MANY OTHER AREAS BY VIRTUE OF THE POINTS I JUST MADE ON BARKED EMISSIONS INVENTORY AND REGULATIONS AND AND RULES. THAT WILL COVER THOSE COMMUNITIES BR VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. I'M MOVING TO OUR NEXT PANEL WHAT'S SO CUENTA RICHMOND. WE'RE GOING TO GET -- A CALL OF JACK BROADBAND AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. MS MARGARET GORDON WEST OAKLAND ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS PROJECT. AND WILLIE ROBINSON RICHMAN NAACP. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. AND I BELIEVE THAT MISTER BROADBENT WILL BE SPEAKING FIRST. IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT HERE MISS PARKER. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JACK BROADBENT ON THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TALKING ABOUT OUR EFFORTS IN IMPLEMENTING. SB SIX ONE SEVEN THE COMMUNITY PROTECTION PROGRAM. I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS THAT WE ARE ON TRACK. TO DELIVER EMISSION REDUCTIONS TO CALIFORNIA'S MOST POLLUTION BURDEN COMMUNITIES IN THE BAY AREA. AS YOU KNOW -- FOR THE BAY AREA WE HAVE TO YEAR ONE COMMUNITIES WEST OAKLAND WHICH IS -- HOME OF COURSE TO THE PORT OF OAKLAND. BUT ALSO HAS A STATIONARY SOURCES IN IT -- BUT ALSO THREE FREEWAY IN RICHMOND WHICH HAS. ALSO A PORT. THE HOME TO THE LARGEST OF CERTAINLY ONE OF THE LARGEST REFINERS IN CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF MOBILE SOURCES -- AND FREEWAYS IN THAT COMMUNITY. AT THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WE'RE PROUD OF OUR EFFORTS IN IMPLEMENTING. SIX SEVENTEEN IN WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO NOT ONLY IDENTIFY AND UNDERSTAND THE LOCAL. CONDITIONS AND SOURCES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES BUT TO ESTABLISH KERR MONITORING PLANS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. I CAN'T OVER EMPHASIZE THIS BUT TO ESTABLISH EMISSION REDUCTION PLANS THAT'S REALLY THE KEY HERE IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTIONS. TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH IN THESE COMMUNITIES. A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS MANAGER BEFORE HANDED OVER A IS REALLY THAT WE BELIEVE IN THE BAY AREA WERE EQUAL PARTNERS WITH OUR COMMUNITY LEADERS -- AND THAT COMES DOWN TO NOT ONLY HOW WE CONDUCT OURSELVES IN TERMS OF FORMING THE STEERING COMMITTEE WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS BUT CONDUCTING THOSE MEETINGS -- MEMBERSHIPS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES BUT HOW THE MEETINGS THEMSELVES HER -- CONDUCTED BUT THEN ALSO THAT IS REALLY CRITICAL AND PARAMOUNT AS TO HOW WE ESTABLISH WHAT GOES INTO THE MISSION REDUCTION PLAN AS WELL. THE OTHER KEY POINT ONE LEVY WITH BEFORE HAND IT OVER TO MR NOTED MY DEPUTY IN CHARGE OF THIS EFFORT. HE IS THAT REALLY ALL EMISSION REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES AND AND SOLUTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE. WE HAVE THE DISTRICT OF COURSE ARE A PROUD OF ESTABLISHING THE MOST STRINGENT AIR TOXICS MISSION STANDARD IN THE STATE FOR A STATIONARY SOURCES. BUT WE KNOW THAT TIME MOBILE OF CREATING THE RISK IN THESE COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND SO -- WE REMAIN OPEN TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT ANY OR ALL MEASURES NECESSARY. TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH IN THESE COMMUNITIES TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. SO LET ME -- DO THIS AND HANDED OVER TO MR NODE AND ALL. I THINK COME BACK ON OUR LAST SLIDE AND IF YOU CAN. NOTICE OF IT AS WELL. GREAT MY NAME IS GREG NOW DIE AND DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR POLICY AT SAID BEAR AIR DISTRICT. AND WALK YOU THROUGH KIND OF OUR APPROACH TO EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA -- IN REFERENCE TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS RECENT IN THE BAY LOOKED AT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAD HIGH VULNERABILITY TO AIR POLLUTION. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF SOCIO ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT FEED INTO THAT BUT ONE OF THE KEY PARAMETERS THAT WE LOOKED AT WAS. LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH AND ACROSS ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE AT TEN TO FIFTEEN YEAR DIFFERENCE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH BETWEEN. WEST OAKLAND FOR EXAMPLE AND SOME OF THE WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES UP IN THE HILLS. SO WE LOOKED AT THAT PARAMETER WE ALSO LOOKED AT EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION. AND THE INTERSECTION OF THOSE TWO SETS IS WHERE WE CAME UP WITH OUR HIGH PRIORITY COMMUNITIES. AND WE SELECTED WEST OAKLAND FOR AN ACTION PLAN IN YOUR ONE BECAUSE QUITE A BIT OF MONITORING HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE IN WEST OAKLAND. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THANKS LARGELY IN PART TO THE EFFORTS OF MS BARBARA GORDON AND HER ASSOCIATES AT THE WEST OAKLAND BY MIDDLE INDICATORS PROJECT. AND ALSO RICHMOND BECAUSE WE HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT RICHMOND WANTED TO USE MORE MONITORING THEIR AND I'LL GET TO THAT ONE BY ONE HERE. SO WHY WEST OAKLAND AS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE MADE A VERY STRONG PARTNER THERE IN THE WEST OAKLAND ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS PROJECT. AND I I MEAN PARTNER IN REALLY THE THE LITERAL SENSE. THAT -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THESE EFFORTS TO HAVE A STRONG COMMUNITY LEADER. IN THE MEETING TO GUIDE HOW YOU PUT THE AGENDAS TOGETHER AND TO GIVE SOME CREDIBILITY TO THE OVERALL PROCESS. THE OTHER ASPECT IN WEST OAKLAND AS JACK MENTIONED IT HAS A LARGE PORT -- AND A LOT OF OTHER SOURCES OF MOBILE SOURCE RISK A COUPLE OF LARGE AIR TOXICS FACILITIES THAT ARE WITHIN OUR REGULATORY AUTHORITY AS WELL. I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AS MINUTES IN A MINUTE AND THEN OF COURSE THE HIGH HEALTH BURDENS -- ASSOCIATED WITH THAT COMMUNITY. SO WE HAVE BEEN IN WEST OAKLAND FOR OVER TWELVE YEARS -- WORKING WITH -- WEST OAKLAND THE I. P.. AND THROUGH THE PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER THE THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND IMPLEMENTING SB SIX SEVENTEEN IN WEST OAKLAND. WE'VE BEEN MEETING WEEKLY WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE WEST OF LUMBER MILL INDICATORS PROJECT. AND TO HAVING MONTHLY TECHNICAL MEETINGS TO GO OVER THE DETAILS OF THE TECHNICAL WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. OKAY INTRODUCTION TO THAT TECHNICAL WORK. EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION IN A COMMUNITY IS A COMBINATION OF REGIONAL SOURCES AND LOCAL SOURCES. AND SO WE DID AN EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT PERCENTAGE WAS SENT ON FOCUSING ON CANCER RISK RIGHT HERE. BUT IT ALSO APPLIES TO THINGS LIKE PARTICULAR MATTER AND DIESEL PM AND THAT SORT OF THING. SO IN WEST OAKLAND A'S BIRD 30% OF THE BURDEN IS DUE TO LOCAL SOURCES -- FOR CANCER AND THIS CANCER RISK NUMBER THE FOUR HUNDRED NINETY SIX PER MILLION IT'S A TOOL THAT THE IN OUR OFFICE AND ARE MENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT DEVELOPED. TO GIVE US ONE MEASURE OF COMBINATION OF RISKS FROM MULTIPLE POLLUTANTS SO. ANYBODY BREATHE IN THE AIR AND AND AND WEST OAKLAND RIGHT NOW. HAS THE SIX HUNDRED IN A MILLION CHANCE OF DEVELOPING CANCER OVER THIRTY YEAR PERIOD DO THE EXPOSURE TO THAT POLLUTION. OF THAT SIX HUNDRED MILLION A HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX PER MILLION IS DUE TO THESE LOCAL SOURCES. AND THE LOCAL SOURCES VARY DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE. MISS PARKER TALKS A LOT ABOUT PROXIMITY AND EXPOSURE. AND NOT JUST FOCUSING ON EMISSIONS AND THAT LAYS OUT IN THIS MAP HERE AND WHAT THIS MAP SHOWS IS HOW CANCER RISK VARIES DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN WEST OAKLAND. AND FOR ANY SPOT ON THIS MAP WE CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE PERCENTAGE CONTRIBUTION IS. AT THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION A COUPLE OF THINGS TO NOTE HERE KIND OF IN THE IN THE LOWER MIDDLE SECTION OF THE CHART AND IN THE UPPER. LEFT YOU SEE A COUPLE OF STATIONARY SOURCES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTING TO RESCUE. THOSE SOURCES ARE SUBJECT TO THE RULE THE JACK MENTIONED OUR RULE ELEVEN EIGHTEEN AND THEY'RE GONNA BE REQUIRED TO GET THEIR CANCER RISK DOWN TO TEN IN A MILLION OR LESS UNDER THAT RULE -- THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT SOURCES BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY BLEND IN WITH THE OTHER SOURCES OF RISK IN THE COMMUNITY -- AND OVERALL THE TO TRUCKS AT ABOUT 33% AND MARINE VESSELS AT PERMITTED FACILITIES THE ONES THAT WITH AND WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION. ACCOUNT 410% OF THE RISK BUT THAT'S KIND OF AVERAGED OUT OVER THE WHOLE COMMUNITY ANY PARTICULAR POINT IN THE COMMUNITY YOU'RE GONNA SEE A DIFFERENT SOURCE APPORTIONMENT. SON I'M GONNA HANDED OFF TO IT AT TO CARLO. THE ACTING MANAGER OF OUR PLANNING GROUP AND WHO'S THE LEAD PROJECT MANAGER FOR THEIR DISTRICT ON THE WEST OAKLAND PROCESS. THANK YOU GREG. SO SINCE THE WEST OAKLAND ACTION PLAN IS AN EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM AS COMPARED TO ONE MONTH. COMPARED TO A MONITORING PROGRAM THE PLAN FOCUSES ON STRATEGIES THAT BOTH DIRECTLY REDUCE EMISSIONS AS WELL AS REDUCING THE COMMUNITY'S EXPOSURE TO EMISSIONS. SO FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS THEIR NEXT NEW POLL THE MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOU -- I'M SORRY YEP AND THAT'S FOR FOR EVERYONE PEOPLE CAN HEAR OKAY. AND USE MY OUTDOOR. SO FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF THE YEAR DISTRICT OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER ON A BROAD RANGE OF STRATEGIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED ON THE SLIDE. SO STARTING AT THE TOP ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES TO THE COMMUNITY IS INCOMPATIBLE LAND USES. SO THE WEATHER INDUSTRIALIZED COMMITTEES WHETHER THEIR PERMANENT OR NOT -- OFTENTIMES DIRECTLY NEXT TO PEOPLE'S HOMES SCHOOLS AND OTHER SENSITIVE RECEPTORS. AND THE NEXT RELATED TO LAND USE ISSUES OUR TRUCK RELATED BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN OR NEAR NEIGHBORHOODS. THE CITY OF OAKLAND CURRENTLY HAS A DRAFT TRUCK MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THESE CONCERNS HOWEVER ARE AB SIX SEVENTEEN PLAN -- SEEKS TO ADD TO THOSE MEASURES AS WELL ZHU'S IN THAT DRAFT PLAN. ALSO THERE STRATEGIES THAT HAVE TO DO A FUNDING -- CERTAINLY FOR FUNDING CLEANER EQUIPMENT BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT AGENCIES IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED THE NEW PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS TO IMPLEMENT EXISTING PLANTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED. STRATEGIES THAT WOULD HELP REDUCE EXPOSURE TO POLLUTION AND CREWS INCLUDE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. SO FOR EXAMPLE VEGETATIVE WALLS CAN MITIGATE POLLUTION COMING FROM FREEWAYS BUT ALSO TREES CAN BE PLANTED AROUND SCHOOLS AND OTHER SENSITIVE RECEPTORS FROM STREET TRAFFIC -- THAT GENERATES POLLUTION. BUT AS MANY OF OUR STRENGTH MANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE POINTED OUT IT'S NOT JUST PLANTING THE TREES THERE NEEDS TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THAT ENSURES THAT THE TREES ARE MAINTAINED AND WATER IT'S THAT THEIR SUSTAINABLE. AT ONE OF OUR RECENT STEERING COMMITTEE MEETINGS THAT REALLY SEEM TO BE ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR WAS WE INVITED THE OAKLAND. CITY VOCALS PLANNING DIRECTOR AND THE ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO COME AND PRESENT ON THEIR DIFFERENT AGENCIES ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES. AND IT REALLY DEMONSTRATED HOW INTERTWINED PLANNING POLICIES ARE. TO TO HEALTH OUTCOMES. SO THAT THAT MEETING GENERATED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THAT IDENTIFIED DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN COORDINATE AMONG LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE AGENCIES. AND THEN LASTLY BROAD GROUP OF CATEGORIES INCLUDES IMPLEMENTING AND TRACKING PROGRESS OF THESE EXISTING PLAN. PLANS WHICH INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT MEASURES. JUST LAST LAST WEEK WE HAD OUR MOST RECENT STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING. AND WE HAD CONSENSUS FROM THE STEERING COMMITTEE ON A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE DISTINCT MEASURES SO THAT WAS I THINK EVERYONE CLAPPED AT THE END OF THAT MEETING. VERY EXCITING MEANING TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND HAVE THAT THAT CONSENSUS STAR NEXT UP IS GOING TO BE PRIORITIZING THOSE. THOSE DIFFERENT MEASURES WHAT WOULD BE DONE IMMEDIATELY AND THEN MID TERM AND THEN SLIGHTLY LONGER TERM -- NEXT SLIDE [inaudible] THANKS. SO THERE CERTAINLY ARE SOME CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY -- RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES ARE NOT ALWAYS REQUIRED TO CHANGE POLICIES THAT CREATE AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR LAND USE POLICIES THAT CAN INADVERTENTLY CAUSE NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. IN TERMS OF AUTHORITY THE DISTRICT -- CAN PROVIDE INCENTIVES WE DO ENFORCE MOBILE SOURCE REGULATIONS WITH THROUGH AMMO USE WITH CARMEN -- BUT IT MADE US BUT WE CAN'T SET REGULATIONS FOR THEM. ON THIS MAY NOT BE AS CRITICAL FOR OTHER A BUT IN WEST OAKLAND MOBILE SOURCES TO ACCOUNT FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THE POLLUTION. AND SO WE ARE GOING TO BE EXPLORING ANY NEW WAYS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS EMISSIONS FROM THESE SOURCES. ALSO ENFORCEMENT REMAINS A CHALLENGE FOR THE STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS SOME ACTIVITIES DON'T NECESSARILY NEED A THRESHOLD FOR NEEDING THEIR DISTRICT PERMIT BUT THEY STILL ARE NUISANCES OR AIR QUALITY NUISANCES TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT MIGHT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE TRASH BURNING A RESTAURANT SMOKING WOOD BURNING. IN TERMS OF THE LAST CHALLENGE WHICH HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT A BIT ARE THE TIGHT TIME ONCE OF THIS -- PROCESS THERE ARE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF COMPLYING WITH SEQUEL THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY STRATEGIES EARLY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SEVERAL PUBLIC COMMENT PERIODS ON IT. THERE IS ALSO THE NEED FOR THE AIR DISTRICT TO DEVELOP THE RELATIONSHIP ITH OUR NEW COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WE ALSO NEEDED TO CREATE THE STEERING COMMITTEE AS WELL AS BUILD THEIR KNOWLEDGE SO THEY COULD PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INPUT INTO THE PROCESS. AND THEN ALSO WE TYPICALLY USE A REGIONAL LANDS FOR ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION BUT AB SIX SEVENTEEN REQUIRED A NEW APPROACH TO ITS TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT WORK. BY CREATING A COMMUNITY LEVEL INVENTORY AND MODELING AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL. AND THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL COORDINATION I THINK MISS MARKETS GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. SO I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP AND AND START TALKING ABOUT RICHMOND. RICHMOND IS A COMPLICATED SITUATION AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS MAP WE'VE GOT A VERY LARGE REFINERY THERE. A PORT. SEVERAL FREEWAYS MANY -- RAILROAD LINES AND ALSO A VERY VALUABLE POPULATION. WHAT ONE OF THE THE THINGS HAVE BEEN PUZZLING US ABOUT RICHMOND IS WITH ALL THE SOURCES? AND THE KIND OF HEALTH OUTCOMES WERE SEEING THEIR IT DOESN'T REALLY MATCH WITH THAT MONITORING DATA SO FAR. SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WERE EITHER NOT MONITOR -- TRYING FOR THE RIGHT THINGS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO START OUT WITH A MONITORING PLAN IN RICHMOND. NOW RICHMOND WILL ALSO BENEFIT QUITE A BIT FROM THE BEST AVAILABLE RETROFIT CONTROL TECHNOLOGY WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. A LOT OF THOSE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON REFINERY EFFORTS AND THEN -- REGULATION ELEVEN EIGHTEEN AIR TOXICS RULE WILL ALSO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT IN RICHMOND IS GONNA BE A NUMBER OF FACILITIES THERE SUBJECT TO THAT RULE. SO WHILE WE'RE PUTTING THE MONITORING PLAN TOGETHER FOR RICHMOND WE'RE GONNA SIMULTANEOUSLY BE REDUCING EMISSIONS THROUGH A REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND OUR INCENTIVE PROGRAM. SO AS JACK ALLUDED TO BEFORE THE THE COMMUNITY GETTING THE COMMUNITY PROCESS RIGHT IS REALLY OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN EACH OF THESE COMMUNITIES. AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES IT TOUGH TO MEET THE TIME LINES THAT ARE IN THE STATUTE THE TIME LINES THAT ARE IN CARBS BLUEPRINTS. BUT WE DON'T WANT TO SHORT CIRCUIT THE COMMUNITY PROCESS. AND SO IN RICHMOND WE DIDN'T HAVE A READY PARTNER LIKE WE HAD IN WEST OAKLAND THERE ARE A LOT OF WONDERFUL VERY IMPACTFUL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN RICHMOND. BUT THOSE THAT ARE FOCUSED ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN PARTICULAR WERE NOT ABLE OR NOT -- COULD NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE ON THAT LEADERSHIP ROLE THAT WE HAD IN WEST OAKLAND. SO THROUGH A SERIES OF MANY MEETINGS AND MANY COMMUNITY MEETINGS WE CAME UP WITH A DESIGN TEAM AND THAT DESIGN TEAM. DESIGNED A COMMUNITY SUMMIT AND THE COMMUNITY SUMMIT LAID OUT THE STRUCTURE FOR HOW THE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEE WOULD BE. WOULD BE NAMED AND SO -- THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND MISTER ROBINSON FOR RICHMOND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT -- IN A FEW MINUTES. SO THIS TO GIVE YOU KIND OF A PICTURE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF IMPLEMENTING AB SIX SEVENTEEN WITH TO COMMUNITIES. YOU CAN SEE THAT FOR EACH QUARTER WE HAVE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES GOING ON BOTH IN THE WEST OAKLAND SIDE AND ON THE RICHMOND SIDE. AND THE IN ONE OF THE STRUGGLES THAT WE'VE HAD AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IS. IT'S CRITICAL TO GET THE COMMUNITY PROCESS RIGHT IT'S CRITICAL TO GET COME TO THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT LEVEL OF TRUST. AND TO HAVE THAT TRUE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT AND MEET THE TIME LINES HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE EVEN IN WEST OAKLAND AND IT'S GOOD PARTICULAR GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE IN RICHMOND. AND JET WHEN JACKETS HIS CONCLUDING REMARKS FOR A TALK ABOUT A PROPOSAL WE'D LIKE TO MAKE TO IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE OF AB. SIX SEVENTEEN TO TO ALLOW MORE TIME FOR THOSE COMMUNITY PROCESSES. SO MADAM CHAIR JUST. THE MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY JUST LAST COUPLE OF KEY POINTS IS -- COURSE -- IN ADDITION -- THE TIME AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE THIS AFTERNOON FUNDING OF COURSE IS ALSO A CHALLENGE -- THIS CHART HERE IS REALLY JUST FOR INFORMATION SAKE IT'S TO KIND OF INFORM YOU OF WHAT OUR CURRENT COSTS ARE WITH REGARD TO THESE TWO COMMUNITIES AND AND REALLY PROJECTING THAT OUT WHAT WE ARE BUT WE'RE SEEING AS WE BEGIN TO THAN. A POTENTIALLY LIST OTHER COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND I MY LAST POINT MADAM CHAIR IS REALLY AT THE POINT THAT MR NOT IN OTHERS HAVE RAISED. IS THAT A STRONG SUGGESTION THAT WE HAVE FOR EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN MOVING FORWARD. IS. TO SEEK TO BE ABLE TO BUILD IN A PROCESS WHERE IN THAT WE COULD -- BILL CAPACITY IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY -- ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS LEARNED TO DATE IS WE REALLY NEED -- THAT PARTNERSHIP OAKLAND INTO A VITAL INDICATORS PROJECT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT PARTNERSHIP WERE ALSO BUILDING IT WITH MISTER. ROBINSON AS WELL AND THEN THAT STEERING COMMITTEE BUT ALL RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY LED TO THE SUCCESS SO FAR IN WEST OAKLAND IS THAT PARTNERSHIP AND WE AND IT'S TIME. TO TO BE BUILT AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT AS WE WORK WITH CARP ON TERMS OF THE TIME FRAME OF IDENTIFYING AND AND COMMUNITIES AND IN MOVING FORWARD AND ESTABLISHING MONITORING COMMITTEES. MONITORING PLANS ANIMUS REDUCTION PLANS THAT THAT GETS BUILT IN TO THE THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. WITH THAT MANAGER THAT'S GOING TO CONCLUDE OUR PARTS REMARKS. ARE REMARKS AT LIKE TO HAND OVER TO MS MARGARET CORDON. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE OP WHAT I'M GOING GOING -- TO GET MORE TAKE DETAILS OF IMPACTS WITH LOCAL. FIRMS SAW WE HAVE THREE RECYCLERS. WE HAVE ANYWHERE FROM SIX THIRTY AM. BESIDES THE THREE FREEWAYS WE HAVE A POST OP OF THIS IS JUST SEVEN WE HAVE A PORT OF OAKLAND AND IS EXPANDING BASED ON AFFECT THE GOT. THE FORMAL ARMY BASE LAYER OF RETURNS THE FIVE ACRES AND IT LANDS WITH SPLIT BETWEEN. THE PORT IN THE CITY SO WOULD SENATE LOCAL WILL OUT TO PORTS. IN THE FUTURE SO THAT'S NOT SO THAT'S NOT INCLUDING THE OF THE TRUCK WITH A BUSINESS OF A REPAIR SERVICES FOOD SERVICES. AND CUSTOMS OF ANY KIND OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS LEVEL THAT THEY NEED FOR IN THAT AREA SO WEST OAKLAND IS STILL A MIXED USE COMMUNITY OF INDUSTRIAL. AND WHAT PEOPLE LIVE AT SO I JUST WANNA MAKE CLARIFICATION TO THAT THEN ALSO I WOULD LIKE COUNSEL STATE THAT. OUR DATA THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED. AN IN THE LAST. THREE YEARS HAS BEEN MORE PACIFIC AND MORE WE FIND THAT WE HAVE EVER HEAD BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE WENT OUT ON ALL THE WAY. TO DO A PROJECT WITH A VIRAL DEFENSE ON A GOOGLE. USE THE GOOGLE CAR AND AQABA. AND THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SO WE WERE ABLE TO GET MORE REFINED DATA THAT WE HAVE EVER HEAD. BOOK ON THE BLOCK. BLOCK BY BLOCK AND ALSO A DEMOCRAT THOSE BLOCKS WILL BILLS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BARS SINCE THE I HAVE SINCE THE RECEPTOR SO ALSO PEOPLE SYSTEMS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY. WHO ARE NOT GOING TO FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHO ARE EITHER HAVE A FROM OUT OF DISABILITY? SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REFINE OUR DAVID TO SUCH A PLACE I THINK. THE I HAD MORE DEFIANT A RE FINE OF LOCATIONS THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD BEFORE NEXT SLIDE. SO THAT'S THE GOAL OF OUR BOB ARE MAPPING OF OUR PROJECT. NEXT LAST. SO AS I SAY THESE ARE WE HAVE ALL THESE ATTRACT THE BUSINESSES WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY -- CONNECTS FLAT. THOSE ARE SOME ARE. MEDIUM ABOVE MID MEDIA AT HIGH LEVELS OF PEOPLE WHAT. IMPACTED BY OF KERR BLACK CARBON NEXT LAST. BY HAVING BILLS PART OF A STARRY MAP. WITH WITH WITH THE THE BACK AND LOOKS LIKE THE STORY MATT. WE CAN REFINE -- WHERE TRUCKS THOUGH WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW? HOW AND WHERE ARE OUT THERE -- THE BUSINESSES THAT I IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITY ARE BEING NEXT LAST. THIS IS BOTH ALSO FELL OF WHERE THE BUSINESSES ARE. ALL THOSE WILL LIVE TRUCKS PROBABLY CONSUME. ALL OF THE TRUCKS THAT ARE ON THAT MAP SHOWS OF THE EXACT WORK THE BIZARRE AND WE HAD NEVER HAD. THE THAT EITHER FROM NO WHERE NOBODY FROM CITY FROM THE COUNTY BAY AREA QUALITY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE. THIS KIND OF DATA. OUR AIM FOR ABOUT WITH OPEN NEXT. FIVE SO THIS IS.

WHAT MORE OF THE COMING THAT IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE IN A THE VOICE IN FLAB CONTACTING FILL INSIDE A BROOKLYN WHERE ANYTHING I SEE IT. OUR ABOUT MY COMMUNITY IS BEING PRINTED OUR OUR THAT IS BEING JUSTIFIED FOR THEM TO DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING. SO THE BOOK NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON WILLIE ROBINSON I AM PRESIDENT OF THE RICHMOND BRANCH IN A C. P. AND I'LL INTEREST IN THIS IS BECAUSE THE NAACP HAVE A COMMITTEE. AND THAT COMMITTEE IS CLIMATE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SO I CAME TO THIS COMMUNITY MEDIAN TO SEE HOW WE COULD IMPLEMENT THAT COMMITTEE AND START TO LOOK AT THE IMPACTS OF AIR QUALITY IN OUR COMMUNITY ALONG WITH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES -- I'D THE PROCESS SO FOR HAS BEEN VERY -- REWARDING TO ME IN AS MUCH AS IT LOOKS LIKE IS NOT JUST STATING COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT BUT IT IS THE TO ME OF COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT. BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY HAS COME TOGETHER HAVE A DISCUSSION AND FROM THAT DISCUSSION THAT WAS THE DESIGN TEAM DEVELOP MODELING WHAT YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER. AND FROM THAT TEAM WE'VE MET OF FOUR MORE TIMES PRIDE TO A SUMMIT AND FROM THAT SUMMIT THE FEEDBACK THEY CAME IN AND THE SUGGESTIONS I WAS PUT IN PLACE USING MODELS THAT WE HAD FROM WEST OAKLAND. TO DEFINE THE EASTERN COMMITTEE AND HOW IT'S GOING TO OPERATE AND PUT IN PLACE THE OBJECTIVE THAT WE WANT TO MOVE TO WHAT -- WE HAVE TO DATE COMPLETED. THAT PROCESS HAVE SELECTED A STEERING COMMITTEE THAT IS QUITE LARGE THIRTY FIVE MEMBERS AND DECIDES RICH AT THE END. TO ATTEST TO THAT RICHMOND AND SENT OUT WAS A VERY LARGE AREA AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE THEY ALSO OUR CONCERN WAS TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE HAD RESIDENTIAL INVOLVED THIS INVOLVEMENT ALONG WITH PARTNERING WITH THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS THEY'RE BOTH CITY OF SAN PABLO AND RICHMOND ALONG WITH THOSE AGENCIES AS OPERATING WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY. AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS NON OF SETTING DATES AND TIME OF MEETING SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING FALL WITHOUT PROCESS UNDER THE GUIDANCE AND DIRECTIONS ALL THE BEER QUALITY MANAGEMENT. ALONG WITH THE ADVISEMENT WE GET FROM PERSON SUCH AS MS MARGARET AND I BELIEVE SHE'S BEEN QUITE AN ASSET TO US UNDERSTAND IN THIS PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- I HAVE A QUESTION -- BEFORE I GO. TO MY COLLEAGUE -- MISS MARGARET BROUGHT UP -- LAND USE AND THAT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HEARD THAT BROUGHT UP SO FAR IN TODAY'S HEARING AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT UP SO MY QUESTION. FOR YOU AND I YOU KNOW I'M SORRY THAT I DIDN'T THINK OF IT TO ASK CARP WHEN. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY IMPLEMENT THIS IS WHAT WHAT HOW DO YOU WORK ON LAND USE IN THESE IN THIS PLANNING DOCUMENT AND WHAT IMPACT I MEAN I I'VE COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO I KNOW THATLOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS YOU KNOW THE CONTROL OVER LAND USE BUT HOW. DO YOU INTERSECTED AND WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND HOW DO YOU INTERCEPTED THE COMMUNITIES. AND DO YOU LOOK AT LAND USE THE PRINCE AND IF SO YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT THAT BECAUSE SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THAT'S A HUGE. A HUGE -- WAY OF MITIGATING -- SOME OF THIS AIR QUALITY AND REALLY MOVING -- VULNERABLE PEOPLE OUT OF THE PATH OF OF THE POLLUTION. SO MANAGER THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION ALL ALL START BUT I WANNA HANDED OVER TO MISS MARGARET CORDON. UP SO LAND USE STRATEGIES IN THE MISSION REDUCTION PLAN ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL FOR WEST OAKLAND I SUSPECT IT'LL ALSO BE WHEN WE GET THERE FOR RICHMOND AS WELL. WHAT WE'RE GONNA NEED WE WE ALREADY KNOW THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS GET THE CITY OF OAKLAND TO REROUTE TRUCKING EVEN FURTHER? AND INDEED -- BOB BEGIN TO START TO PUT IN PLACE A SET OF LAND USE DECISIONS THAT MAY INVOLVE FRANKLY MOVING SOME OF THESE SOURCES. HOW FROM THE COMMUNITY AND PUT THEM IN A WAY FROM THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE INSIDE WEST OAKLAND? THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS OVER TIME YOU HAD A LOT OF REALLY BAD LAND USE DECISIONS TO TAKE SOURCES. OR AND ALLOW HOMES TO BE RIGHT UP BUILT UP RIGHT UP NEXT TO EACH OTHER. AND SO. I THINK WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS GOING TO RELY ON IN AND FRANKLY PRESSURE SO THAT THE CITY OF OAKLAND. IN THEIR LEADERSHIP COMES THROUGH INCLUDING THE MAYOR SO WE CAN MOVE SOME OF THOSE SOURCES OUT OF THE WEST OAKLAND COMMUNITY THAT'S THAT'S LARGELY A BIG STRATEGY WE'RE GOING TO BE RELYING ON INDIVIDUAL ACTION PLANS SO IS MARGARET. YEAH OR DO YOU. THOSE MAPS HE'S GIVING PEOPLE OF ONE ABOUT WHAT'S OPEN. THIS DOES ANYONE OWN. MARK STONE OKAY. OKAY REAL QUICK THERE'S ONE BACK. ANY ANY MAP RESERVES WAS OPEN. OKAY. TO YOUR RIGHT. THEN BUT MADRE. BIG MONEY RIGHT HERE THERE ARE. AND IF I'M NOT A PROBLEM I'LL HOUSES. BUILT UP ON THE FRONTAGE ROAD NONE OF THAT HOUSING. HAVE IF INTO INDOOR FILTRATION. AND THE CITY IS ALLOWING. NEW PEOPLE GET SICK. THAT'S SOMETHING OUT THAT'S WHY I'M THAT'S WHAT THEY ABOUT LAND USE. AND THEN THE ALLOW. THOSE THREE FOUR FIVE ABOUT ABOUT HOUSE OF THE BILL BUILT ON ONE SIDE IS THE FREEWAY ONE SIDE OF THE BORDER AND THEN AS A REFLECTING. SEVEN RIGHT NEXT OF IT. LOOKS LIKE WITH A RIGHT NEXT TO IT. THE BRINK TRUCKS IN MAY THEN THE ALL NEW TRUCKS BUT STILL GOT TRUCKS. SO I'M JUST SAYING THAT'S HOW. THE FOOD IS STILL. NOT PROTECTED WITH ANYBODY. BROWN LAND USE BY ALLOWING HOUSING. TO BE ABLE. AFFORDABLE MARK READ ALL OF THE BE BUILT RIGHT A FIELD NEXT TO BELIEVE. THESE BUSINESSES THAT WILL I MEAN I I THINK. YOU'RE YOU'RE HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF RESPONSIBLE A LAND USE PLANNING AYE. I GOT A I KNOW THAT -- GO WE'RE WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME MORE BILLS -- THEY'D BE PROPOSING GAIN ON THE ONE HAND AS YOU TRY TO ADDRESS THE THE HOUSING SHORTAGE AND IN IN IN OAKLAND IN THE BAY AREA BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE WHERE WHERE WE'RE NOT SURE CUTTING GO. INTO PROCEDURES. TO TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. PUTTING HOMES -- YOU KNOW AND AND AND PLACES THAT ARE NOT THREATENING THE THE THE THE HEALTH OF OF OF THE RESIDENTS THAT ARE BEING -- SO -- MS GORDON THANK YOU I I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR PASSION AND YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR EFFORTS INTO. ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES -- I I I JUST I WANTED FOCUSING -- YOU KNOW THIS PAGE -- IN YOUR PRESENTATION ON THE CHALLENGES AND IN PARTICULAR THE THE THE THE POINTS THAT YOU IDENTIFIED IN TERMS OF LIMITED AUTHORITY LIMITED ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING ORDINANCES. I MEAN GOING TO MS BUT WHAT I'M HERE MS GORDON SAYING IS THAT YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW I JUST -- BE -- THE PROVIDING FEEDBACK YOU WANT YOU MAKING A DIFFERENCE TAKING THAT INFORMATION -- AND AND MAKING THINGS BETTER THAT AND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE THE THE THE THE THE AUTHORITY OR OR IF THE EXISTING ORDINANCES ARE NOT BEING ENFORCED THEN. YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING ALL THE ALL THE FEEDBACK -- AND AND AND SO [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH. I GOT THE TREES I'VE BEEN LIVING THINGS LIKE THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE CITY DONALD STREETSCAPE PROJECT CUT DOWN THE TREES ON WHAT TO CUT DOWN THE TREES BECAUSE IT WILL GIVE A SEVENTY MORE. SEVENTY MORE WOULD CHOOSE THE BUT NEVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AT THE MICRO SINCE IT AND ALL SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE AIR QUALITY ISSUES OF WHAT'S OPEN. I'D STILL TODAY I'M STILL TRYING TO I'M LOSING IT WOW. THE CITY PUT SEVEN PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT ALLOWABLE STRINGS TO BE. TOWARD OUT METAL NOW. SO. YEAH THAT WAS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE LA YOU YEAH YOU KNOW IT IS IT'S A LOT OF STUPID STUFF THE HAVE YOU CAN HAVE. TO BRING A SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE CITY OF OAKLAND DUE TO MAKE SURE THAT TO THE THAT THAT THEY THEY ADDRESSES ISSUES BUT YOU DON'T HAVE BEFORE US AT THAT AT THE STATE. YOU KNOW AS AS AS THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF HOW TO ADDRESS THESE -- THESE ISSUES OF THE LIMITED AUTHORITY -- YOU KNOW IN IN IN ORDER TO ENFORCE ACCOUNTABILITY. WELL AT THE RISK OF UPSETTING SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT ARE STILL TO STILL TO TESTIFY I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE SOME -- AUTHORITY QUESTIONS THAT -- PROBABLY OUGHT TO BE. LOOKED AT WITH REGARD TO LOCAL DISTRICTS. AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT COMES TO MIND IS -- INDIRECT SOURCE AUTHORITY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT -- I THINK THAT WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH IS IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE A STATIONARY SOURCE. IN TERMS OF STACKS BUT IT IT ATTRACTS A LOT OF TRIPS. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- THE LAW IS A LITTLE BIT WITH REGARD TO THE BARE. THE LAW COULD BE STRENGTHENED. IN TERMS OF PROVIDING AUTHORITIES BECAUSE IN THE WEST OAKLAND COMMUNITY WE DO HAVE THESE INDIRECT SOURCES THE POST OFFICE COMES TO MIND WHICH IS RIGHT SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COMMUNITY. IT IT IS TRACKS A LOT OF TRIPS AND INDEED IS HAVING A BIG IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITY SO AS AN EXAMPLE THAT IS. ONE WHERE -- FRANKLY WE OUGHT TO EXPLORE IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY -- FOR THE AIR DISTRICTS AUTHORITY TO RELOCATE THOSE THOSE TYPE THEY WOULD PLAN YOU. ESSENTIALLY AUTHORITY. RICK. PROVIDED TO THE OUR DISTRICT TO REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS CASE THE THE POST OFFICE. TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN WHEREBY THEY COULD -- DEPLOYED ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY -- KEEP IN MIND WE TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THEY MAY OR MAY NOT NECESSARILY -- TAKES STEPS ALONG THESE LINES OF LESS THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO SO. SO USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE AUTHORITY THAT THE COULD BE SO STRICT. BUT THIS PLAN IS BEING PUT TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERS AND ELOPED ULTIMATELY COME BEFORE MY BOARD. WHICH WILL -- CONSIDER ADOPTING IT IN THE FALL OF THIS YEAR AND THEN -- BEFORE IT ONTO A CAR AND DURING THAT ENTIRE PROCESS WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING TO CARVE TO ALSO COME TO THE TABLE. AND BE -- SEEKING. TO STEP UP TO THEIR COMMITMENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND WHAT THEY WILL DO AS WELL -- TO RELATIVE TO THE MOBILE SOURCES. SO WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AND SEE IF INDEED -- SOMEONE IS WHETHER -- WHAT'S ALREADY BEING COMMITTED TO BY CAR ISN'T GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT AND IF NECESSARY WILL THEN COME BACK WITH THEM. SOME ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY -- SICK SICK SOME ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY. HI I KNOW THAT PART OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN WAS AND SAID FIT IN. IN IN WEST OAKLAND. IN WEST OAKLAND WE DO HAVE -- THE BIG GUYS SOURCE NEARBY. SO STILL SHREDDING FACILITY AND IT SHOWS UP ON OUR MAPS BUT FRANKLY -- THAT WAS A VERY WELCOME STEP AS PART OF SIX SEVENTEEN BECAUSE THE OF THE TIMOTHY AUTHORITIES HADN'T BEEN TOUCHED IN PROBABLY TEN PLUS YEARS. AND THEY NEEDED TO BE STRENGTHENED SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE VERY MUCH WELCOMED. AT THE DISTRICTS SO ARE INCREASE PENALTIES BEING IMPOSED THEY'RE ALREADY A PART OF HOW WE IMPOSE OUR FINES AND PENALTIES ON THE SOURCES YES. SO THEY'VE BEEN LEVIED ON THAT THAT PART TO SEE IF THERE'S BEEN ANY -- VIOLATIONS OKAY. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THAT IS THE DARKEST SOURCE IN THE BOTTOM IS THAT YOUR STEEL SHREDDING.

THE PASSAGE OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN LEGISLATION. AND THE AWAY UNWAVERING LEADERSHIP OF PUSHED OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DARLA GARCIA. AND I AM I REMEMBER JUST COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL AIR DISTRICT PROVIDING THE SUCCESSFUL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION BEGINS AT THE GROUND LEVEL. AS IMPERIAL COUNTY A POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICER MATT DOES REPRESENT. CALL ME TO SEAQUEST PARTNERED WITH THE OUR DISTRICT TO BRING THE SPIRIT OF AB. SIX SEVENTEEN TO FRUITION. FOR THE BETTERMENT OF HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR COMMUNITY. WE ARE SHARING A CO CHAIR IN OUR AB SIX SEVENTEEN COMMITTEE. STEERING COMMITTEE ALONGSIDE THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT TO BRIDGE THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PEOPLE THEY SERVE. AB SIX SEVENTEEN IS MAKING THIS PARTNERSHIP. A RARE A REALITY. PRIOR TO AB SIX SEVENTEEN SUCH A PARTNER CHEN UPS PART SUCH A PARTNERSHIP WAS UNHEARD OF LET ALONE NON EXISTENT. TODAY WE ARE DEVISING THEIR MUNCHING PLANS EMISSIONS REDUCTION STRATEGIES. TOGETHER WITH THE HELP OF PEOPLE WHO. WHO KNOW THEIR ENVIRONMENT BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE THE COMMUNITY? IMPAIR VALLEY'S COMMUNITY CORD OR EVERY EVERY PROTECTION PROGRAM. IS A DIRECT RESULT OF WHAT CARP OUTLINED IN AMBITION IN THE DRAFT. THE COMMUNITY A PROTECTION PROGRAM TO PRINT. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE MANDATES AS OUTLINED WITHIN THE BLUEPRINT. NOPE WHERE DISTRICTS MUST BE WILLING TO ADAPT ACCORDINGLY. THERE DISTRICTS MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN ENSURING THEY ARE FULFILLING THE COMMUNITY A PROTECTION PROGRAMS DIRECTORS. BY ACCEPTING COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION. AS IN THE CASE OF OUR DISTRICT THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT IS THROWN BY OUR MIDDLE JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONAL PARTNERSHIP. AND NOT SOLELY REPRESENTATION OR INCLUSION. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A MAJOR KEY TO SUCCESS AND THE PROGRAM. AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. THROUGH AB SIX SEVENTEEN PROCESS. FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE OR ACCEPT THIS REALITY IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. AND SIMPLY CONTRADICTS THE PROGRAM'S MISSION. IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE WAY CALIFORNIA AGENCY SERVE AND WORK FOR THAT REPRESENT RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES. IN CONCLUSION AB. SIX SEVENTEEN IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRES A COMMITTED CONCERTED EFFORT. FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL. OF EVERY KIND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE STATE CAPITAL. AIR DISTRICT ENGAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION ARE AT THE CORE OF THE COMMUNITY OF PROTECTION PROGRAM. AND MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM'S SUCCESS. CARP SHOULD BE OVERSEEN AIR DISTRICTS AND MEDIATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS IN ORDER TO REINFORCE. THEIR WORKING RELATIONSHIPS FINALLY STATEWIDE COORDINATION AND RESOURCE AVAILABILITY WILL BE FUNDAMENTAL AND FULFILLING. THE SPIRIT OF AB. SIX SEVENTEEN IN PROMOTING AND REALIZING THE ENVIRONMENTALLY. SAFER AND HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL RESIDENTS. AND NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR A TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. YOU VERY MUCH. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. JUST A FEW COMMENTS MA'AM CHAIR ONE X. KNOWLEDGE TO WORK IS BEING DONE BY BOTH. SIR MIDDLE AND MISTER DESERT BRINGING COMMUNITY GATHER. TOOK NEARLY THE PARTNERSHIP THAT -- IS UNDER WAY WITH THE OUR DISTRICT AND MICKEY KILEY -- WHICH AS YOU SAW IN THIS SLIDE TO REALLY. ISN'T A A BORDER AND MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE PORTER TALL ENOUGH BIG ENOUGH. THICK ENOUGH TO KEEP. THIRTY YEAR ON ONE SIDE -- FROM MOVING TO THE OTHER AND THAT'S TAKEN A LOT OF WORK -- TO COME TOGETHER OF COURSE OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE WORK OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND LEADERSHIP OF MISS CORY IN. FRONT BRINGING THIS TOGETHER I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE REGION. A REGION THAT -- UNFORTUNATELY STATISTIC THAT PART TOO LONG HAS TO BE MENTIONED THAT. SEVEN OUT OF TEN CHILDREN SUFFER FROM RESPIRATORY DISEASE PROBLEMS ALL OF THESE EFFORTS. ARE UNDERWAY OURS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC. AND WELL BEING OF OF THE FOLKS OUT THERE I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR DESERT NEED. MENTIONED. THIS IN PASSING. THE REVIEW OF THE AG BURNING POLICY FOR THE AIR DISTRICT I'M I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING MORE ABOUT THAT IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO JUST KIND OF GIVE US A AN OVERVIEW FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND BOTH LOCALLY AS WELL AS THE WHITE. THAT THIS IS A PRACTICE THAT CONTINUES -- IN THIS REGION AND SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS IS BROUGHT UP BY MANY CONSTITUENTS -- IN FACT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S WIDE [inaudible] OR WHY THERE ARE MORE -- EFFORTS TO REDUCE IT AND I THINK PART OF IT IS PEOPLE NOT KNOWING WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING AT THE DISTRICTS OF PERHAPS YOU CAN KIND OF SHARE WITH US WHAT IS THAT. REVIEW OF THE POLICY LOOK LIKE IT WILL OF THE LEGISLATION EXISTS THAT THAT ALLOWS THE AG COMMITTEE THE FARMING COMMUNITY TO DO THIS AS A AS A PRACTICE OF CULTURAL PRACTICE -- AND WE WE WE ORGANIZED WE WE MONITOR IT WE WE WE RUN THE PROGRAM -- WE LOOK FOR THE RIGHT TYPE OF WEATHER ON THOSE DAYS SO TO MAKE SURE THE SMOKE. RISES TO A CERTAIN LEVEL AND DISPERSES -- WITH DOING THE THE THE LEAST DAMAGE OF THE LEAST PROBLEMS AS POSSIBLE -- IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE WORKING WITH THE WEATHER -- BUT WE DO OUR BEST AND WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESSES THERE -- WE'RE ALL HOPING THAT THE LEADERSHIP THAT WE SHOW. ON OUR SIDE OF THE BORDER WITH OUR RULES AND REGULATIONS IN THIS NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEXICO. THAT MEXICO GETS AN APPETITE FOR SOME OF THAT AND THE FIRST STEP FOR MEXICO WOULD BE A BABY STEP WOULD BE AN ACT BURN PROGRAM. AND THAT FIRST BABY STEP WITHIN pSTOP BURNING THEIR FIELDS AT NIGHT SO THE INVERSION LAYER DOESN'T HOLD THAT SMOKE. IN THE MORNING. OR SPECIFICALLY BACK TO THE POLICY SO IT'S A MINISTRY TO POLICY WE'VE BROKEN THE IN PROVIDING TO FOUR DIFFERENT QUADRANTS WITH A MAXIMUM OF THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ACRES A DAY THAT CAN BE BURNED FIVE HUNDRED ACRES PER QUADRANT -- WORD LOWER THAT TO FOUR HUNDRED ACRESPER QUADRANT OR TOTAL OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED ACRES TODAY. WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT MAKING THE BURN SMALLER. BOTH THE RESIDENTIAL BURNS WHICH ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR VIOLATIONS BAG BURN -- FOLKS ARE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB A VERY GOOD JOB. SO IF THE FIELDS ARE SMALLER. AND THE SEQUENTIALLY THEY CAN BE BURNED -- THERE OF LIST IMPACT LESS VISUAL IMPACT. AND LESS CUMULATIVE IMPACT -- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT OUR SPECIAL BURN AREAS AROUND ARE SENSITIVE RECEPTORS ARE CITIES. A RIGHT NOW THAT WE SPECIAL BURNED REQUIRES A INSPECTOR TO BE ON SITE. IT'S BEST BETTER HIGHER STANDARD WHETHER CONDITION SO THOSE BIRDS CAN TAKE PLACE. THERE'S A MILE AND A HALF BUFFER AROUND THESE COMMITTEES COMMUNITIES AND CITIES VERY SIMILAR TO THE BUFFER THAT SURROUND THEM FOR PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS -- WE'RE LOOKING AT MOVING THAT BUFFER OUT AN ADDITIONAL HALF MILE -- WE ARE BERNIE CHRIS HAVE COME DOWN IN TIME SO THAT BE A TWO MILE RADIUS. HAVE COME DOWN WE HAVE AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM EMISSION REDUCTION RED CREDIT PROGRAM. THAT HAS IT IS WORKING AND I BIRDS HAVE COME DOWN IN A GREAT SIZE. HOWEVER IT'S JUST IN THIS DAY AND AGE I EVEN THOUGH IT'S LEGAL OF THE AVAILABLE AND IT'S RIGHT. IT'S THE IT'S HARD TO PUBLICLY DEFEND AG BURNING -- OUT OUT THERE WHEN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE. CALLING IT OUT. FOR ASTHMA PURPOSES FOR HEALTH PURPOSES SOMETIMES IT'S SIMPLY VISUAL PURPOSES. AND WE DO HAVE PEOPLE THAT ABUSE THE COMPLAINTS SOMETIMES THEY EVEN CIRCUMVENT OUR LOCAL. OFFICE AND CALL STRAIGHT TO THE CARDBOARD AND WE'VE BEEN. ON IT TO TO MAKE RESPONSES TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF THOSE AND THE LAST TWO YEARS. QUESTION IF YOU HAD A A PERCENTAGE THAT YOU COULD TO PUT FORWARD TO SAY. DURING THE EXT PERIOD OF TIME TO PRESS REDUCTION IN NEXT PERCENT OF THE LEGAL BURNS AND EVEN FOR THAT MATTER THE NEED. FOR LEGAL BURNS WOULD YOU HAVE A NUMBER THAT YOU COULD. PUT FORWARD OR IS THAT SOMETHING MAYBE THAT WE HAVE A GRAPH PUT TOGETHER AT THE DEPARTMENT THAT SHOWS THE BURNS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF ACRES OF BURNED WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT CROPS THAT ARE SEASONALLY BURNED BERMUDA GRASS AND AND WHEAT STRAW. AND THOSE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY COME DOWN IN NUMBERS AS A CULTURAL PRACTICES IN THE TRADITIONS OF THOSE FARMERS. AND FAMILIES A NEW GENERATIONS OF COME ALONG OR PERHAPS THE MARKET PRICE OUR DEMAND FOR WHEAT HAS. HAS HAS GONE DOWN BUT IT DOES SPIKE PERIODICALLY I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS OFF HAND BUT I WILL SEND YOU THAT CRAFTED AT THE TELEGRAPH IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE. TO YOU -- EDWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE SAY SOME. REMARKS AT THE EVENT WERE WERE WERE DONE WITH THAT TESTIMONY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR COMING. OKAY NEXT FOR BRINGING UP -- THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT -- AND WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM REPRESENTATIVES FROM WILMINGTON WEST LONG BEACH CARSON IN EAST LOS ANGELES BOYLE HEIGHTS COMMERCE AND SAND. PORTANTINO AND WITH SQUARE -- SO FROM SOUTH THREE THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER PHILLIP FINE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER. JOE OKAY GOSH HEALTH EFFECTS OFFICER. AND THEN WE HAVE FROM SEAL CV -- CALIFORNIA VOICES PROGRAM FROM SAM READY NO MATTER OUR BROCK MACIAS -- MARC LOPEZ IS HERE FROM EAST YORK COMMUNITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FROM COMMERCE AND JESSE MARK HAS FROM THE COALITION FOR SAFER ENVIRONMENT FROM WILMINGTON. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM. A SOUTH COAST UP. FIRST BEFORE THE COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS WAYNE ASTRI I'M THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER. FOR THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO REPORT ON THE STATUS. OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN IMPLEMENTATION IN THE SOUTH COAST REGION. AND LIKE MY COLLEAGUE JACK BROADBAND. ECHO IN THE FACT THAT -- WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE MAKING UP ARE ALREADY ACHIEVING EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BRING. EARLY -- EMISSION REDUCTIONS THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INCENTIVE PROJECTS. I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. ACTUALLY HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING IN COMMUNITIES. OF BOTH THROUGH OUR CLEAN COMMUNITIES PROGRAM WORKING ALSO WITH THE TARGET ERROR SHOULD GRANTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- IN AREAS INCLUDING. BOYLE HEIGHTS AND SAN BERNADINO. THE FOCUS OF THE INCENTIVE PROJECT HAS BEEN ON ACHIEVING THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THROUGH PRIMARILY REPLACEMENT OF HEAVY DUTY TRUCK ENGINES. AND SO WE UTILIZE THE FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CAR LAWYER PROGRAM. AS WELL AS YOU AB ONE THIRTY FOUR IN ADDITION TO THE HEAVY DUTY TRUCK ENGINES. WE ALSO LOOK AT OFF ROAD ENGINES A MARINE ENGINES. AND OTHERS. I WOULD SAY THAT ASA RESULT OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN BE REALLY TRIED TO ENHANCE. THE AWARENESS THROUGH CARL MOYER AND I WOULD SAY THAT AS A DIRECT RESULT OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN WE'VE ALREADY SEEN A THREE FOLD RESPONSE. TO SOLICITATIONS THROUGH THE CAR MORE PROGRAM. WE'VE ALSO EMBARKED ON AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF COMMUNITIES AS A RB DESCRIBE -- WE LOOKED AT ALMOST A HUNDRED DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FACTORS. INCLUDING PROXIMITY OF SOURCES TO UTILIZING CAL ENVIRO SCREEN LOOKING AT THE RELATIONSHIP OF SOURCES TO A SPECIAL. OF POPULATIONS. AND SO THERE WAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ACTIONS THAT WE DID AND FINALLY ON THE PARK RULES UPDATE. REMOVING VERY AGGRESSIVELY TO OF PHASE OUT REKLAME AND INSTITUTE A NUMBER OF THE BAR CONTROLS. SO WITH THAT -- AS I MENTIONED WE'VE ALREADY ALLOCATED OVER ONE HUNDRED AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROJECTS. TO REDUCE DIESEL EMISSIONS PRIMARILY. AND AS WE KNOW IT NEARLY 90% OF THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THIRTY MILLION OF THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN IN AB SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE BECAUSE THE FIRST YEAR OF FUNDING WAS REALLY DONE BEFORE THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES. AND THAT GETS TO THE ABILITY OF THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN IN NON ATTAINMENT STATUS FOR SO LONG IT'S DEVELOPED AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLANS AND THOSE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLANS. OR THE BLUEPRINT FOR HOW WE HOPE TO COME INTO ATTAINMENT. ANNA DESCRIBES IN A WAY THAT. THE FACT THAT WE NOW KNOW WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY WE KNOW THAT WE CAN REDUCE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S EXPENSIVE. AND SO THE CHALLENGE IS HOW DO WE HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE AND MAXIMIZE THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS. IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY HAVEN'T TO PERHAPS ENJOYED THE BENEFITS OF THAT WE'VE SEEN THROUGH. A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN CLIMATE INVESTMENTS. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THOSE PARTICULAR ASPECTS. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED WITHIN THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WE HAVE THREE COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE ROAMING TEN CARS IN WEST LONG BEACH. WE ALSO HAVE SAN BERNADINO AND MY SCHOOL LIKE. AND THEN WE HAVE THE BOYLE HEIGHTS IS LOS ANGELES WEST COMMERCE. THIS IS UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S REALLY MUCH MORE THAN JUST ONE COMMUNITY IT'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. AND WE FELT THAT FROM A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE. OF THAT NATURE OF THE SOURCES OF THE GOODS MOVEMENT ASPECT. THAT IT WAS MUCH PREFERABLE FOR US TO SORT OF TAKE A LARGER. VIEW IF YOU WILL OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND WE WANT TO TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE RESULTS WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES. SO THAT'S WHY YOU SORT OF SEE THAT IT'S NOT JUST ONE PARTICULAR COMMUNITY. BUT RATHER A SIMULATION OF A MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES CITIES LOCALITIES AROUND THAT AREA AND SO. I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO DR GOSH -- TO DESCRIBE ABOUT THE ACTUAL EFFORTS THAT WE'VE BEEN LEADING ON THE GROUND. THANK YOU -- SO LATE LAST YEAR AFTER THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD DESIGNATED THAT THE THREE A YEAR ONE EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES IN OUR DISTRICT WE FORMED A COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES FOR EACH OF THESE COMMUNITIES. THE PURPOSE OF THESE COMMITTEES -- WAS TO HELP US IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE THE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION ISSUES AND HELP GUIDE THE STRATEGIES THAT WILL BE WRITTEN INTO THE COMMUNITY PLANS. OF THE MEMBERS RAP VERY OF A VERY DIVERSE -- SET OF OF AFFILIATIONS -- THEY ARE ALL -- MAJORITY RESIDENTS -- COMMITTEES BUT ALSO INCLUDES -- COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION LOCAL BUSINESSES AND LABOR UNIONS UNIONS REPRESENTING LOCAL WORKERS -- WE ACTUALLY WORKED REALLY HARD TO ENGAGE LAND USE AGENCIES AND WE DO HAVE A LAND USE H. AGENCIES REPRESENTED ON ALL THREE OF OUR STEERING COMMITTEES -- WE HAVE A AND WE HAVE OTHER -- REPRESENTATIVES AS AS WELL. THIS IS A ROUGHLY THE TIMELINE THAT THE STEERING COMMITTEES I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING SO WE FIRST STARTED BY IDENTIFYING THE COMMUNITY AIR QUALITY CONCERNS ARE NOT JUST WITH THE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THEMSELVES BUT ALSO WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ATTENDED WHO ATTEND OUR MEETINGS -- WE THEN WENT THROUGH A PRIORITIZATION PROCESS WITH ALL THREE OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO HELP -- IDENTIFY WHICH OF THESE -- AIR QUALITY CONCERNS REALLY ROSE TO THE TOP IN TERMS OF WHAT -- THESE COMMUNITIES WANTED TO ADDRESS THREE A AND FINALLY WE ARE BEGINNING THE PROCESS TO DEVELOP THE MEASURES AND THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS THAT WILL BE WRITING INTO -- INTO THESE PLANS. I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU A FEW OF THE NUMBERS SO -- ACROSS THE THREE COMMITTEES WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FORTY A STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND ALTERNATES US SO FAR WE'VE HELPED THIRTEEN COMMUNITY MEETINGS. ALL THE MEETINGS HAVE BEEN TO A VERY VERY WELL ATTENDED -- BOTH BY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL AS BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC EYE AND ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE CERTAINLY WELCOME -- TO TO ATTEND AND PARTICIPATE IN OUR MEETINGS -- WE HAVE TWENTY THREE MORE MEETING SCHEDULED A ON THE COMMUNITIES IDENTIFIED OVER TWO HUNDRED AIR QUALITY CONCERNS. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A TASTE OF WHAT OUR COMMUNITY MEETINGS LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THE WHAT THEY WHAT WHAT THEY FEEL LIKE SO -- THE FIRST WE WE TRY -- TO HAVE A AN INTERACTIVE FORMAT WHENEVER POSSIBLE THE PHOTO IN THE TOP LEFT SHOWS -- ONE OF OUR SMALL GROUP DISCUSSIONS WHERE WE HAVE THE AIR QUALITY ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED PRINTED ON THOSE BLUE CARDS OR DID DIFFERENT CARDS ARE ON THE TABLE AND THEY'RE SORTING OUT. SORTING OUT THE CARDS IN THIS PRIORITIZATION CONSENSUS BUILDING ACTIVITY OF THE GRAPHIC ON THE TOP RIGHT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS WHENEVER POSSIBLE WE ACTUALLY TRY TO WE TRY TO INCLUDE ENGLISH AND SPANISH ON THE SAME GRAPHIC -- SO THAT THEY ARE INTEGRATED. BOB WE STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO BROADCAST OUR MEETINGS ON FACEBOOK LIFE TO HELP ENGAGE A YOUNGER AUDIENCE PARTICULARLY YOUNGER AUDIENCES THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTEND OUR MEETINGS IN PERSON. SO WE'VE BROADCAST ALL OUR MEETINGS ON FACEBOOK LIFE -- AND FINALLY I JUST JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ALL MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH WE DO PROVIDE SPANISH LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION AND HAVE ALSO PROVIDED OTHER LANGUAGES AS WELL -- AND WE DO TRY TO ALSO PROVIDE REFRESHMENTS WHICH IS ONE OTHER ONE OF THE I REQUEST -- FROM FROM THESE COMMUNITIES AND WHEREVER POSSIBLE TRYING -- TO PATRONIZE LOCAL BUSINESSES THERE. BUT WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM OUR ABOUT OUR STEERING COMMITTEE MEETINGS -- EIGHT IN PARTICULAR I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. WE ARE USING A A CO HOST -- AND ALSO AN OUTSIDE FACILITATOR TO HELP A RUN THESE MEETINGS SO THE CO HOST IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE MET UP. IS ACTUALLY A STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBER WHO LIVES IN THAT COMMUNITY WHO SERVES AS THE CO HOST AND HELPS US RUN THOSE MEETINGS -- WE TRY VERY HARD TO PRESENT ALL THE MATERIALS IN PLAIN LANGUAGE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN COMPLIMENTED ON THIS WHICH IS GREAT -- AND AGAIN YOU KNOW THE THE SPANISH LANGUAGE MATERIALS WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE. A FEW STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO SPEAK ARE PRIMARILY SPANNER WHO PRIMARILY SPEAK SPANISH AND SO -- BUT THEY'VE EXPRESSED -- THAT IN SPANISH. BUT NOW CERTAINLY A PROGRAM OF THIS COMPLEXITY. X. IT CAN COME WITH MANY CHALLENGES AND AND WE'VE WE'VE CERTAINLY COME ACROSS A A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE'VE WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP -- IS SO -- FIRST I THINK TOWARD THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS THAT WE HAD A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THE STEERING COMMITTEES AND WHAT AUTHORITY THEY HAVE -- WHAT FORTY THE COMMITTEES HAD I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE A COMMITTEE CHARTER US IT THE CHARTER FOR EACH OF THE CAN A CHARTER FOR EACH OF THOSE COMMITTEES -- AT THAT REALLY -- EMPHASIZED WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE THE THE KEY ROLE OF OF THE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES -- AND HOW THEY WILL PLAY A ROLE IN HOW THESE PLANS ARE SHAPED BUT THAT ON EIGHT AS HE CAN DO AND CARPORTS WILL RETAIN THEIR AUTHORITY. WE HAD A COUPLE A STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AMONG MEMBERS OF OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND SO -- I HEY WE EMPHASIZE THE REALLY THE IMPORTANCE OF OF THAT TRANSPARENCY AND WE HAVE -- AT THE HAVE ASKED ALL THIS -- FEES ALL ON OUR WEB PAGE AS WELL. UGH THE COMMUNITY BOUNDARIES WAS OF IT WAS A BIG TOPIC OF DISCUSSION AT OUR FIRST COUPLE -- STEERING COMMITTEE MEETINGS FOR EACH OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND WE CERTAINLY GOT A LOT OF INPUT AND WE REALLY WANTED TO DIG INTO THE THE THE REASONS FOR FOR THAT THAT SPECIFIC INPUT FOR THAT SPECIFIC TASK OF CHANGING THE BOUNDARY IN A CERTAIN AREA TO A CERTAIN. A CERTAIN LOCATION AND SO WE WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH ALL OVER STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO HAD MADE THIS REQUEST AND CAME TO A CONSENSUS AGREEMENT ALL THREE OF THE COMMUNITY BOUNDARIES HAVE BEEN FINALIZED. SO -- I THINK PART OF THE CHARGE OF THIS PROGRAM WAS TO USE BOTH TECHNICAL DATA AS WELL AS COMMUNITY INPUT AND DEVELOPING THESE PLANS. AND SO REALLY PART OF THE CHALLENGE IT IS REALLY TRYING TO PRESENT A LOT OF THIS TECHNICAL DATA IN AN ACCESSIBLE WAY THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE TO THE PUBLIC -- ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE'VE USED -- IS THE THE INTERACTIVE STORY MAPS WHERE WE PRESENTED INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING WHAT FACILITIES ARE LOCATED WHAT TYPES OF FACILITIES AYE THEY ARE. LAND USE INFORMATION -- AND WITH LOCATIONS SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS AND OTHER A SENSE THE RECEPTORS -- WE ALSO -- DIGITIZED ALL THE AIR. AT THAT -- THAT WERE PROVIDED TO US -- SO THE MAP ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT SHOWS THE EAST LA BOYLE HEIGHTS THE WEST COMMERCE A COMMUNITY -- WITH THE EACH DOT REPRESENTING A UNIQUE AIR QUALITY CONCERN -- THAT WAS THAT WAS RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE OR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AND A FINAL -- AFTER AFTER THE CONCERNS OR AIR QUALITY CONCERNS WERE IDENTIFIED WE DID GO THROUGH A PRIORITIZATION ACTIVITY WITH ALL THREE OF OUR COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES AND I WANTED TO PRESENT -- THE SOME OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED FOR EACH OF THESE COMMUNITIES AGAIN HIGHLIGHTING THAT EACH COMMUNITY IS UNIQUE AND THEY THAT WE ARE WORKING HARD TO TAILOR THE PLANS. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE COMMUNITIES SO FIRST WHETHER WILL MEET IN CARSON AND WEST LONG BEACH COMMUNITIES AGAIN OF COURSE OUR PORTS JERRY COMMUNITY. THE THREE HIGHEST PRIORITY ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED WERE REFINERY ADMISSIONS PARTICULARLY EMISSIONS ARE RELATED TO FLARING LEAKS AND UP AND SPECIFIC TYPES OF EQUIPMENT SUCH AS HEATERS AND BOILERS -- THE PORTS -- PORTS RELATED AND LIKE -- VERTICALLY CONCERT A LOT OF CONCERNS AROUND I DIESEL EMISSIONS -- IDLING TRUCKS AND ALSO SHIP EMISSIONS -- BUT SOME ADDITIONAL HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES THAT WERE -- THAT THAT WERE RAISED THROUGH THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS INCLUDING OIL AT YOUR INCLUDED OIL DRILLING AND PRODUCTION RAIL EMISSIONS AND ALSO -- CONCERNS AROUND SCHOOLS NOT AS A POLLUTION SOURCE OF COURSE BUT AS A AS A PLACE WHERE A KID SPENT A LOT OF TIME. I NEXT OUR STANDARD YOU KNOW IN MY SCHOOL -- THIS IS OF COURSE ARE INLAND EMPIRE COMMUNITY. AND IN THIS COMMUNITY THERE IS A MAJOR RAIL YARD -- THE BNSF RAILYARD WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ISSUES BUT IN PARTICULAR THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THE I WOULD SAY THAT REALLY ROSE TO THE TOP VERY CLEARLY IN THIS COMMUNITY WAS NEIGHBORHOOD TRUCK TRAFFIC. AND PARTICULARLY TRUCK TRAFFIC RELATED TO WEAR HOUSING -- BUT ALSO RELATED TO THE WHERE TO THE A RAIL YARD AS WELL -- ADDITIONAL HIGH PRIORITY CONCERNS INCLUDE THE ON THE TRANS -- BUS YARD FACILITY THERE'S ALSO LOCATED WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY AND ALSO A COUPLE OF CEMENT FACILITIES -- IN THAT AREA -- FINALLY OUR EAST LA BOYLE HEIGHTS IN WEST COMMERCE AGAIN OF COURSE THIS IS THIS IS -- FAMOUSLY THE THE WHERE THE EAST LA INTERCHANGE IS LOCATE ALL SORTS CONCERNS -- BUT NOT SURPRISINGLY THE HIGHS PRETTY ISSUES INCLUDED NEIGHBOR TRUCK TRAFFIC -- INCLUDING A TRUCK TRAFFIC ON FREE WITH THAT ALSO MAJOR ROADWAYS AND ALSO A TRUCK TRAFFIC THAT WAS LOCATED VERY CLOSE TO WHERE PEOPLE LIVE OR WHERE PEOPLE GO TO SCHOOL -- THERE ARE A THERE WERE CONCERNS AROUND WAREHOUSES PARTICULARLY AGAIN TRUCK TRAFFIC RELATED TO WAREHOUSES AND ALSO CONCERNS ARE REGARDING -- RAIL YARD EMISSIONS BOTH FROM LOCOMOTIVES OTHER EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS THE TRACKS THAT THE THAT THE RAIL YARD -- SOME ADDITIONAL HIGH PRIORITY CONCERNS INCLUDED -- THE SCHOOLS IN THE AREA AND ALSO -- MIDDLE FACILITIES AND TOXIC WASTE FACILITIES. I WE PRESENTED. A SUITE OF POTENTIAL STRATEGIES -- THAT WE CAN -- USE IN THE COMMUNITY IN WRITING THE COMMUNITY PLANS VERTICALLY FOR THE EMISSION REDUCTION PLANS BUT I ALSO THE AIR MONITORING PLANS SO THIS INCLUDES -- DEVELOPING REGULATIONS. IT OF DIFFERENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS USING A MONITORING -- IN A VERY TARGETED FASHION TO HELP ADDRESS THESE A COMMUNITY CONCERNS AND IN PARTICULAR -- YOU KNOW WHERE IT WHERE IT MAKES WORK TO ATTRIBUTE TO TO FOLLOW UP ON ANY THAT FOLLOW UP ON THE RESULTS OF MONITORING WITH ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT -- WE'VE ALSO DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED AS PART OF THESE PLANS -- A WE ARE TRYING TO ACTIVELY COLLABORATE WITH A VARIETY OF OTHER AGENCIES INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES AND LAND USE AGENCIES AND FINALLY WERE CERTAINLY ALSO CONSIDERING -- EXPOSURE REDUCTION STRATEGIES AS WELL. WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IN OUR US DURING COMMITTEE MEETINGS IS REALLY HOW TO INTEGRATE THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STRATEGIES SO JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OUT OF THE DIESEL TRUCK EMISSIONS CAME UP AS A HIGH PRIORITY IN ALL THREE OF OUR COMMUNITIES? AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IS USE MONITORING OR OTHER DATA TO IDENTIFY WHICH TRUCKS ARE THE FREQUENT FLYERS IN THAT IN THAT COMMUNITY. AND FROM THERE WE CAN ACTUALLY HELP TARGET OUR INCENTIVE SO THAT WE GET THE MORE GET MORE BANG FOR OUR BUCK. WE'VE ALSO -- HEARD A LOT ABOUT UP A TRUCK IDLING TRUCK IDLING LOCATIONS AND WE CAN. WE CAN USE OUR TARGET ENFORCEMENT SWEEPS TO HELP ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND ALSO WE'VE REACHED OUT TO OUR LAND USE AGENCIES TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO A COLLABORATIVELY WITH REGARD TO TRUCK ROUTES AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL TIMING. I WITHOUT GOING TO HEAD OFF TO DR PHIL FIND TO TALK ABOUT OUR PARK REAL DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU DOCTOR GOSH -- PHILIP FIND UP THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT SOUTH COAST FOR PLANNING AND WILL DEVELOPMENT AND IF I TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN REQUIREMENT FOR THE BEST AVAILABLE RETROFIT CONTROL TECHNOLOGY -- FOR THE SOUTH COAST THAT REQUIREMENT TOOK ON NEW MEANING BECAUSE FOR MANY YEARS WE HAD OUR RECLAIM PROGRAM. WHICH WAS A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM -- FOR NOT NITROGEN OXIDE IN A SELF RESOURCES. ARE BOARD HAD ALREADY. ADOPTED A PLAN TO A SENSE THAT THAT PROGRAM BUT WHAT AB SIX SEVENTEEN DID IS REALLY LIGHT A FIRE UNDER OUR EFFORTS WITH THE DEADLINE -- AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO IMPLEMENT PARKED -- IN OUR REGION SO WHAT TYPICALLY WE WOULD -- AMEND WE CLAIM EVERY FIVE YEARS OR WORK ON PARK TOOLS FOR NON WE CLAIM SOURCES MAYBE ONE OR TWO A YEAR AS YOU CAN SEE HERE. WE HAVE REALLY GONE INTO OVERDRIVE AND ARE WORKING ON A A ABOUT A DOZEN RULES IN PARALLEL TO IMPLEMENT BARKING EXCEPT ARE EX WE CLAIM FACILITIES AS A COMMODITY CLAIM. IT'S A COMPLEX PROCESS IT'S A COMPLEX PROGRAM -- WE'VE ALREADY ADOPTED A SERIES OF THREE RULES ACTUALLY ONE WAS ACTUALLY THREE RULES. SO -- THREE WILL TO ADOPTED ALREADY AND THEN COMING UP THIS YEAR WE HAVE A WHOLE SERIES OF RULES THAT WE THINK WE CAN GET TO IN. TWENTY NINETEEN AND THEN A FEW MORE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO REALLY. TO REALLY REQUIRE -- BARKED AT THESE FACILITIES THE CAP. BARKED EQUIPMENT REDUCTIONS BUT IT DIDN'T ENSURE THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY WAS GOING TO HAVE -- THE BEST AVAILABLE CONTROLS AND GOING FORWARD UNDER THIS COMMAND CONTROL STRUCTURE THAT WILL BE THE CASE. I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER -- TO MISTER NASTY FOR THE FINAL SLIDE. THANKS TALK TO FIND. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- I CERTAINLY WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT BAY AREA MADE WITH REGARDS TO THE LIMITED AUTHORITY -- WITH REGARDS TO AS YOU KNOW DISTRICTS HAVE PRIMARY AUTHORITY OVER STATIONARY SOURCES. WELL WE CAN UTILIZE SOME OF CARBS ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES. TO A TRUCK ANTI IDLING EFFORTS. YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE AND WE'RE CERTAINLY IN DISCUSSIONS WE WANT TO EXPLORE. HOW WE COULD SEE MORE ENHANCED ON ROAD TESTING WE WANT TO SEE HOW WE CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER LARGER SOURCES? WHICH AS WE KNOW OF WITH THE PORT COMPLEX. WE HAVE THE LARGEST CONTAINERIZED PART COMP AND IT'S THE ONLY SOURCE OF KNOCKS IT'S GOING TO BE GROWING OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. SO WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO REDUCE. THOSE OCEAN GOING VESSELS IN ORDER. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS IN THE PORT AREA AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO REDUCE EMISSIONS TO ACHIEVE. ATTAINMENT. WE ALSO FACE WITH THAT PERSONNEL CHALLENGES MANY OF THE DISTRICTS -- AND AGENCIES ARE FACED WITH THE LARGE NUMBER OF RETIREMENTS AND SO WE'RE ALL COMPETING FOR THE SAME PERSONNEL PULL TO HIRE PEOPLE SO THAT WE CAN MOVE MORE QUICKLY. THE OTHER ASPECT IS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OFTEN NECESSARY. TO DISPLACE THE OLDER TECHNOLOGY IS FAIRLY EXPENSIVE. AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEAR. A QUITE OFTEN IS THAT WE WANT TO PURSUE ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY. YET HOW CAN WE GO FOUR ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY IF WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE FUNDS AND IS THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF READY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT. WE ASK OURSELVES WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE TECHNOLOGY IS READY CAN BE DEPLOYED IN CAN BE SUPPORTED IT SHOULD BE. WORD ISN'T CAN WE GET EMISSION REDUCTIONS THROUGH OTHER MEANS I THINK THOSE ARE PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE COMING A HEAD. AS WELL AS THE OVERALL TIMING. MOVING FOR A IN A WAY THAT ALSO HAS EXTENSIVE PUBLIC PROCESS SOMETIMES THE TWO AREN'T -- COMPATIBLE AND IN ORDER TO HAVE A BETTER. PUBLIC DISCOURSE WE MAY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. AND WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT THAT IN SOME OF THE DISTRICTS THEY ACTUALLY ADVOCATE FOR INCREASED TIME. WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THAT DESIRE BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE THAT. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE FOR FAR TOO LONG COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN SUFFERING AND WE NEED TO MOVE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. THESE ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE MOVING HAD AND WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. HELLO I'M NOT A BLACKSMITH C. S. AND I AM JUST HELPING THE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS EDUCATION FUND COVER WHAT'S PROGRAM HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE SAN MEDINA AND MISS KHïI COMMUNITIES ANY FIGHT BEGAN OFFICIALLY MY STATEMENT. I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALTHOUGH THE THREE OF US ARE MEN IN MY COMEY TO SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY IT'S A LOT OF WOMEN AND THOSE WHO IDENTIFY OTHER THAN SAYS MEN ARE REALLY HOLDING IT DOWN. AND LEADING ORGANIZING EFFORTS I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM IN A STATEMENT TODAY IS IN COLLABORATION WITH THEM. ROM SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR HAVING HEARING TODAY. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACE WHO INVITED ME TO COME ON BEHALF OF OUR COMMUNITY -- SO TODAY WE'RE HERE TO HELP ANSWER THE QUESTION BERMAN TATIAN OF A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN OUR AIR BE AND THE AIR DISTRICTS ON TRACK TO DELIVER EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS TO CALIFORNIA'S MOST POLLUTION BURN COMMUNITIES. AB SIX SEVENTEEN IMPLEMENTATIONS ON TRACK I HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT. BUT FIRST I FEEL WE MUST ASK BEFORE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. I KNOW FIRST TACKLE THE QUESTION BY REMOVING THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN LEAD. WHAT I WANNA KNOW? IS WHERE IS THE HEARING. ON IS CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE ON TRACK TO DELIVER EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS CALIFORNIA'S MOST POLLUTION BRING COMMUNITIES. I'D LOVE TO COME BACK FOR THAT HEARING. BUT ON A SERIOUS NOW. WE ARE ASKING US TO DO TODAY IS TO TELL YOU ABOUT A PROGRAM THAT EXIST. AND CERTAINLY SINCE IT DOES EXIST THE COMMITMENT THAT THE STATE HAS MADE MUST BE FULFILLED. BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY TRULY GETS THROUGH THE ISSUE RIGHT AND I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER AB SIX SEVENTEEN HAS A CONTEXT IN WHICH IT EXIST -- BECAME ABOUT AS AT COMPROMISED. AND AB THREE NINETY IS THE CAP AND TRADE EXTENSION ARE MECHANISM IN THE STATE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS BUT IT'S PROVEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. NOT TO WORK TO REDUCE EMISSIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND NOR THE STATE NOW OUR RATE OF REDUCTIONS HAD INVERTED. AND WE'RE NOT ON TRACK TO MEET TARGETS. ALSO WE KNOW WILD FIRES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO JEOPARDIZE NOT ONLY OUR LIVES. BUT OUR ABILITY TO MEET EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS EVERYTHING WE'VE MITIGATED I RACED BY WILDFIRES THEN THERE WAS THE LITTLE NOT SO LITTLE REPORT THAT CAME OUT LAST FALL WHICH REMINDED US. OUR TIMELINE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS MUCH CLOSER THAN IT APPEARED. KIND OF LIKE A REAR VIEW MIRROR IN A CAR. BUT UNLIKE REVIEW MEARS WE CAN'T LOOK BACKWARDS EVER GOING TO GET THE REDUCTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND STATE. THE POINT WE NEED MORE AGGRESSIVE NOT ACTION NOW. I KNOW THIS IS NOT NEWS TO ANY OF YOU ARE COMMUNITIES AND ARE YOU TO ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN BEATING THIS TRAUMA ALL ALONG. AND EVEN TO THE MEMBERS IN THIS COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT PRESENT TODAY. DO NOT SUPPORT THE FALSE PREMISE THAT WITHOUT CAP AND TRADE WE HAVE NO PROGRAM FOR THE STATE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE NATIONAL MAY BE EVEN GLOBAL LEADER ON CLIMATE SOLUTIONS THAT ALSO ENCOURAGES ECONOMIC GROWTH -- I WAS GOING TO REACH OF THEIR STATEMENTS TO NOT SUPPORT AB -- THREE NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT IT SAYS BUT I'LL JUST SUMMARIZE WITH -- ONE THERE WERE SOME MEMBER MARK STONE AND SOMEWHERE MONIQUE LIMON FOR REFERENCE -- OUTSTRIP I'LL JUST READ THEIR WANT ONE SENTENCE FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEGAL STATEMENT HE SAID. I LOOK FOR EVIDENCE OF THE CAP AND TRADE MECHANISM WHAT IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING AND REGULATORY POLICIES IN PLACE TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT. BUT THE BILL FELL SHORT OF PROVIDING SUCH EVIDENCE. AND TO THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS I UNDERSTAND THE PREDICAMENT YOU WERE IN AT THE TIME -- AND I WORK FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT ALSO AT THE TIME UNFORTUNATELY MADE THE SAME DECISION TO SUPPORT THIS PACKAGE OF BILLS AT THIS. AND I KNOW VERY MUCH THAT YOU ALL AGREE WITH ME WITH WHAT I'M SAYING RIGHT NOW AND ARE LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT AND BEST THING TO DO. AND ARE READY TO TAKE BOLD ACTION TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF RADICAL REDUCTION OF THE MISSIONS IN THE NEXT DECADE TO KEEP THEM WARMING BELOW TWO DEGREES CELSIUS AND WHO BELIEVE IN THE INGENUITY OF CALIFORNIANS TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS. AN INTERSECTIONAL WAY. THAT CREATES EQUITABLE OUTCOMES FOR ALL IN CHANGES WHAT IS POSSIBLE FOR OUR STATE. WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT HOW THEY RELEASED AB SIX SEVENTEEN IS THIS AT THE POLICY WITH THE COMPROMISE IT'S ONE THAT I DON'T BELIEVE WILL MAKE A REAL OR SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOR DELIVER IN EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS? CRITERIA POLLUTANT REDUCTIONS OR TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT REDUCTION AND I'LL GET MORE INTO WHITE SHORTLY. I DO THINK HOWEVER YOU AT THE BODY. HAVE THE ABILITY TO CORRECT THAT NO LONGER IS IN PLACE. GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. AND WHILE I'M STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM'S POLICY POSITION IDEAS ON CLIMATE WILL LOOK LIKE BECAUSE I PERSON TALKING SUPPORT BUT NO CLEAR AGENDA YET ALTHOUGH I SHOULD NOTE A BRIGHT SPOT THE NEW HELP THE P. H. CHIEF STATED THAT CRITTER POLLUTANTS. WILL -- BECOME A PRIORITY -- I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT MAYBE PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THE BEST DECISION AT THE TIME. BUT WE NOW NO LONGER IS NOW. NOW TO ANSWER TO THE SPIRIT OF THE QUESTION AROUND. EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH IS NOW A REALITY. BY ALL MEANS IT WAS IMPAIRED IT'S IMPERATIVE WE DIRECT EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN TO A TANGIBLE SUCCESS FAR COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE IT STANDS AS THE ONLY REAL STATEWIDE EMISSIONS REDUCTION STUDY THAT ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS POLLUTANTS AND SOURCES IN COMMUNITIES LIKE SALMON ENORMOUS KHïI. TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FAMILY DRAMA SCHOOL WAY. IT'S ONE TOP BY CENSUS TRACT COMMUNITIES FROM CALAVERAS SCREEN. IT'S LOW INCOME. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE HAVE KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL BETWEEN THE B. NSL FELL YARDS HIGH TRAFFIC TRUCK ROUTES GOING TO AND FROM WHERE HOUSING. AND NATURAL GAS PIPES AND TANKS THAT HAVE LEAKED. AND LIKE WHAT JUST HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND WICKS BUT 40% OF ALL GETS THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES COMES TO OUR BACKYARDS. IMAGINE ALL THAT TRUCK TRAFFIC JUST TAKE A SECOND TO IMAGINE ONE HUNDRED DIESEL TRUCKS PER HOUR COMING DOWN YOUR STREET. HOW THAT BILL? UNDOUBTEDLY THE NEED TO ADDRESS GREAT HERE POLLUTANTS IN EMISSIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY IS SO -- DE OVER THE YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN SO MANY PLANS BUT VERY LITTLE CHANGE. SOME OF THE MOST COMMON CHALLENGES THESE PLANS HAVE FACE ARE ALSO TRIP AB. SEVEN SIX SEVENTEEN FIRST WE MUST DISCUSS ENFORCEMENT. MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR COMMUNITIES TO GET THEIR HOPES UP FOR ANOTHER PROGRAM PROMISING IMPROVEMENT. ONE OF THE REASONS OUR COMMUNITY REMAINS IN NON ATTAINMENT COMMUNITY FOR CRITERIA POLLUTANTS IS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ENFORCING WHAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. ALSO THERE'S NO LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT I COULD IDENTIFY THAT DISCUSSES REPERCUSSIONS TO CARP HM DE FOR NOT REACHING THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM. SHARE AN ORGANIZATION CAN GO THROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS TO ENFORCE THE PLAN BUT NOT PUTS ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON OUR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALREADY PUTTING OUT FIRES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. LITERALLY TO APPARENTLY. THE STATE NEEDS TO FIND BETTER MEANS TO ENFORCE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REDUCTION PLANS. WHERE FREIGHT WILL COME UP WITH THE PLAN BUT THERE WILL BE A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENFORCE THE PLAN AND ENFORCE COMPLIANCE FROM THE SOURCES? ONE WAY THE SENTIMENT HAVE ALREADY ARISEN HAS BEEN FROM THE TYPE OF MONITORING THE DISTRICT IS LOOKING TO USE. AIR MONITORS THAT ARE PLANNED TO BE YOU IT ENOUGH TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE SO THEREFORE SOURCES OF POLLUTANTS CAN'T BE SUBJECTED TO ENFORCEMENT BASED ON MOST OF THE MONITORING BEING FUNDED IN THE PROGRAM. THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME. BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO SPEND MONEY ON THE PROGRAM THAT WE SHOULD DO IT RIGHT AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE BEST AVAILABLE MONITORING. THAT WILL ALSO ALLOW ENFORCEMENT OF SOURCES. OF FORT UNFORTUNATELY THAT LEADS TO THE SECOND CHALLENGE. THE FUNDING COMMITTED IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM AS BEST AS POSSIBLE. I DO WISH TO RECOMMEND EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN FOR INCREASED FUNDING IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET -- I THINK THE STATE HAS MADE MANY COMMITMENTS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON TO FILL PROMISES. DON'T MAKE THIS ANOTHER. ONE BEFORE WE CAN EVEN BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT YOUR TO COMMUNITIES WE NEED A PROGRAM THAT'S PROVEN EFFECTIVE I THINK THE LEGISLATURE TO THE BUDGET NEEDS TO MAINTAIN COMMITMENT TO YOUR ONE COMMUNITIES. ALSO THE NEED FOR DRESSING POLLUTANTS IN EMISSIONS IS SO VAST WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO MORE COMMUNITIES. BUT WHAT WE DON'T NEED IS THE STATE TO THROW MONEY AND FINDING A WAY TO A PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY ACHIEVE ENFORCEABLE REDUCTIONS. WE NEED TO GET SET COMPLIANCE WE'VE BEEN OUT OF A COMPLAINT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THROWING MORE MONEY AND SUBSIDIZING BRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE. WE NEED TO KIND OF GET OUT OKAY BECAUSE I GOT LIKE A LOT GO AHEAD GO BUT YOU KNOW WHAT -- YOU CAN THE NUMBER I SAID BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE EVERYONE IS SUPPOSED TO BE EIGHT MINUTES IN YOUR LIFE MYSELF IS ALSO MADE IN WRITING. THERE WE GO -- BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT I THINK THE BIGGEST CáC OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN IS IS IF YOU WANT TO DELIVER CRITERIA POLLUTANT. DELIVER -- CURTIRPOLLUTANTS IN AT AN AIR TOXIC REDUCTIONS WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION ON DIESEL TRUCKS -- WE DON'T MEAN ON ENFORCEABLE STATES AND PLANS ON A WE DON'T NEED THE NEXT AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY THAT LEASES SUSCEPTIBLE TO EXPLOSIONS NEXT TARGET SCHOOLS AND WE DON'T NEED PUBLIC DOLLARS SUBSIDIZING BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT INDUSTRIES BECAUSE THEY TEND TO TAKE JOBS AWAY. ON I KNOW IT'S A IN THIS KIND OF CLIMB IT SOMETIMES IT'S SEEN AS WE NEED COURAGE SHOULD REALLY TAKE ACTION ON TRUCKING -- AND I KNOW THE SENSITIVITY TO WORKERS AND ALSO FEDERAL CHALLENGES. A FEDERAL CHALLENGES GETTING US THE SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ZERO MISSION TECH -- TRUCKING -- BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH SAYS AND SENSITIVITY FOUR SEVEN EIGHT YOU KNOW MY SCHOOL I AND OTHER COMMUNITIES BURDEN CANCER RESPIRATORY DISEASES AND DEATH -- BUT I'M SENSITIVE TO THOSE WORKERS I HAVE FEELS WHO ARE FORMER TRUCK WORKERS -- AND I UNDERSTAND HOW IT HELPS pA HUNDRED BUT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S RECENTLY STATED STAT. LIKE WORKING IN A RESPONSE IT BEGIN ABOUT AUTOMATION HOW THIS. AND THE REASON WE'RE NOT EXCITED IS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB YOUR LEFT TO DIE AND THAT IS AT ITS CORE OUR PROBLEM. AND IT'S SOMETHING OUR CLINIC POLICIES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED THANKS [inaudible] HELLO. THANK YOU MATT THAT WAS THAT WAS AWESOME. I I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT -- HI MY NAME IS MARK -- I'M WITH YOU START COMMUNITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND ALSO SIT. ON THE COMMITTEE FOR BOYLE HEIGHTS EAST LA AND AND COMMERCE AND I'M A RESIDENT WITHIN THE THE TARGETED AREA FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS [inaudible] AND WHEN AB SIX ONE SEVEN CAME UP. WE SAID NO. WE SAID THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE WANT -- PROCESS IS IN PROGRESS WHEN IT'S A DISTRACTION TO POLICY THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND WORKING ON FOR YEARS -- I WILL GIVE A A LOT OF PROPS TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA -- BECAUSE I THINK. A RESPONSE TO OUR CRITIQUES WAS THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT MONITORING THIS IS ABOUT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. AND IF WITH THAT THAT WE ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS -- WE'RE WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT HERE TO SAY WE TOLD YOU SO WE'RE HERE TO MAKE IT WORK. RIGHT -- BECAUSE IF WE DON'T MAKE IT WORK THEM WHAT ARE WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS. AND SO -- WE'VE BEEN HERE TO MAKE IT WORK WE'VE BEEN AT A Q. M. D. TO MAKE IT WORK. I CAN POINT TO TOO MANY THINGS BUT I'LL POINT TO THE PORT BACKSTOP RULE IN PARTICULAR. WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO ENSURE THAT -- THE PORTS. OF ALLEY IN LONG BEACH REACHED EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS TARGETS. AND THAT. IT WOULD BE ENFORCEABLE. UNFORTUNATELY THERE WERE SOME CHANGES IN IN THE BOARD MAKE UP AND STAFF DIDN'T BRING IT TO THE BOARD. AND SO WHEN QUESTIONED. PUBLICLY WHAT WAS STATED -- OR YOU KNOW LEGALLY IS KNOWLEDGE HE SAYS IS NOT AVAILABLE YET. BUT WHAT STAFF TOLD US DIRECTLY WAS IT WASN'T POLITICALLY FEASIBLE ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE NEW PORT MAKE [inaudible] WHICH IS THE WORST POSSIBLE REASON TO NOT DO THE RIGHT THING RIGHT. AND SO -- ALSO POINT TO INDIRECT SOURCE RULES WHICH WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK -- WORK AT WITH. WITH THE DISTRICT AND UNFORTUNATELY -- PORTS ARE NOT NOT REALLY PART OF THE CONVERSATION -- RAIL IS IS REALLY ABSENT IN AND WHEN IT COMES TO WAREHOUSES -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMHO USE AND THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING THAT THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN WE WANT SOMETHING THAT'S ENFORCEABLE. AND SO PRIOR TO A. B. SIX ONE SEVEN WE REALLY GOT A POINT BACK TO SB ONE RIGHT IF WE'RE GONNA GET THE THE THE LARGER CONTEXT. AND SO -- OUR OUR ASSEMBLY WOMAN WAS ABLE TO GET THE GOVERNOR TO COME DOWN AND VISIT WITH US AND AND THAT WAS A GREAT SESSION AND TING HE HEARD FROM FROM MANY STAKEHOLDERS. AND EXPRESSED INTEREST IN IN -- INDIRECT SOURCE WAS HE ACTUALLY -- EXPRESS A LITTLE BIT ARE SHOCKED THAT WE DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE THAT IN HOW ARE WE CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAVE INTERREX SOURCE RULES -- UNFORTUNATELY. WHAT WE GOT BACK WAS WAS A BE -- SIX ONE SEVEN AND AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE HERE TO MAKE IT WORK RIGHT. SO WHEN WE ATTEND. THE A. B. SIX ONE SEVEN MEETINGS IN OUR COMMUNITIES UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS IS KIND OF A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH FROM THE DISTRICT -- AND I THINK WHAT WHAT. WHAT I'VE NOTICED FROM THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS OF HEARING EVERYONE BUT ALSO FROM FOLKS THAT WE WORK WITH CONSISTENTLY AS ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE DIFFERENT RIGHT? EVEN WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING US IT'S LITERALLY THE SAME GOODS MOVEMENT FOR STRUCTURE -- BUT YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT ARE IN FRONT OF YOU YOU HAVE TO CENTER THE THE THE COMMUNITIES AND NEEDS TO BE COMMUNITY LEAD AND THEY THINK. I DESCRIBED EARLIER TODAY IS THIS PROCESS FEELS LIKE IT'S BEEN POSTED LEAD. RIGHT VERY VERY SURFACE ENGAGEMENT -- FEELING KIND OF LIKE CHECKING A BOX LIKE THEY'VE ALREADY SET UP A PLAN FOR HOW THIS PROCESS IS GOING TO ROLL OUT. AND AND THE REALITY IS WE'RE READY TO GO WE WERE READY TO GO MONTHS AGO WE ARE READY TO GO YEARS AGO RIGHT. AND SO I THINK -- THE ENGAGEMENT WITH THOSE OF US WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROCESS NEEDS TO BE A REFLECTIVE OF WHERE WE'RE AT WE NEED TO BE MET. WHERE WHERE -- WE DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH MONTHS OF A PROCESS -- TO TO TRY -- TO ESSENTIALLY GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE'VE BEEN AT RIGHT THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT -- BECAUSE AT LEAST FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT THEY REALLY FELT LIKE AN EIGHT Q. M. D. -- PUBLIC RELATIONS ROLL OUT. THOUGH THE WAY THE SOME OF THE MEETINGS WERE WERE HANDLING -- AND AND I UNDERSTAND FOR FOR FOR FOLKS WHO MAY BE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE DISTRICT MAYBE IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT MAY BE NEEDED BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE ENGAGING IN THIS PROCESS -- WE KNOW WHAT A KIM DE IS WE'VE WE'VE KNOWN WHAT THEY'VE DONE -- AND WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE INTO. RIGHT. AND SO -- YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES AGAIN TWENTY BACK TO MONITORING [inaudible] AND AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE CALLED OUT CONSISTENTLY IS ESPECIALLY IF IF FUNDS ARE BEING INVESTED IN MONITORS THAT ARE NOT PROVIDING ADEQUATE INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT. THAT CAN BE IN. IN FLEET TO ENFORCEMENT -- IT'S REALLY NEEDING TO NOTHING -- WE'VE WE'VE DONE LOW COST MONITORING. WE'VE DONE THAT IN OUR COMMUNITIES FOR FOR TWO DECADES RIGHT TO THINK WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS RIGHT -- AND WE'VE DONE IT BECAUSE THE BOARDS THE AIRPORTS HAVE BEEN DONE THEIR JOBS. THAT'S WHY WE'VE DONE IT. WE DID LOW COST MONITORING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE RESOURCES. SO WHEN THE DISTRICT COMES BACK IN AND IS TALKING ABOUT THIS BEING ONE OF THEIR STRATEGIES -- IT'S SHOCKING THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO REPLICATE WHAT WE'VE DONE. FOR US THE RESPONSES ACT LIKE AN INSTITUTION YOU ARE AN INSTITUTION YOU ARE AN AUTHORITY YOUR GRANTED CERTAIN POWERS. ACT WITH THAT RIGHT -- SHOWS YOU CAN TAKE ACTION SHOWS YOU CAN IN FORCES -- AND SO WE'RE HERE WE'RE READY TO GO AND AND A LOT OF CASES WE ACT AS A BRIDGE. RIGHT YOU HEARD FROM FOLKS EARLIER TODAY THAT WERE PUT INTO OTHER AGENCIES AND YOU TO ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS WE NEED TO ENGAGE WITH THOSE AS WELL -- NOW I'LL I'LL CALL BACK TO ONE OF OUR OUR OUR MEMBERS IN THE COMMITTEE -- RAFA WHO WAS ON THE VERGE OF DISRUPTING THE MEAL KEPT COMING OUT WHY ARE WE GOING THROUGH THROUGH THIS DE CHARETTE RIDER OR CHARADES WHEN WE KNOW WHAT THE ISSUES ARE. RIGHT AND SO WE TOOK A FORTY FIVE MINUTE PROCESS TO GET TO THE POINT THAT HE WAS MAKING THAT. ARE THOSE PRIORITIES THERE AND YOU SAID WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST MANY WE TALK ABOUT IN THE LAST MINUTE EVERY MEETING WE KEEP BRINGING UP THE SAME ISSUES. WE DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH THESE PROCESSES BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT THE ISSUES ARE LET'S TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS I GUESS THAT'S NOT ON THE VERGE OF WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. AND SO AGAIN WE'RE HERE TO MAKE TO MAKE IT WORK -- AND AND THE REALITY IS WE WE LIVE IN A IN A POLITICAL ECOLOGY. RIGHT AND SO MY FEAR IS THAT WHERE WE'RE HEADED IN THIS PROCESS AND I KIND OF THOUGHT IN THE POWER POINT A LITTLE BIT PRESENTED EARLIER. IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE. GUIDED UP TO TO PUT IT NICELY WE'RE GONNA BE GUIDED -- TO SUPPORT A BALLOT MEASURE TO CREATE A FUNDING STREAM -- THAT IS ESSENTIALLY GOING TO OUR TOWARDS FALL SOLUTIONS IT'S A THAT THE DISTRICT IS IS INTERESTED IN. AND AND REALLY IS HEADING TOWARDS YES -- WE'VE ALREADY SEEN -- CONSULTANTS AND AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN LOS ANGELES PUMPING UP THE THE FUTURE OF THIS THIS MEASURE -- AND TALKING ABOUT FUNDING WHAT WHAT'S AVAILABLE NOW WHICH IS NATURAL GAS AND THEN IN TEN YEARS WE CAN CONSIDER -- ZERO EMISSIONS -- WHICH OF COURSE IS IS NOT AT ALL WHAT WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN WHERE WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN ANY PUBLIC FUNDS GOING. TO A TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME -- WE'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OF THAT BREACH AND SO -- WE KNOW THAT THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE ALL TIED TOGETHER AND SO -- THIS ISN'T TO SAY FREE POLLUTION IS IS OUR ONLY ISSUE AN INDIRECT SOURCE RULES -- ARE DEFINITELY NOT OUR ONLY SOLUTION -- BUT IF IF WE CAN'T MOVE TOWARDS THESE REGULATORY SOLUTIONS WITH ALL THE DATA ALL THE FUN DEAN AND ALL THE COMMUNITY DIRECTION THAT HAS ALREADY EXISTED. THEN WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THESE AGENCIES MOVING FORWARD RIGHT -- WE NEED ACTION FROM THE LOCAL. AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AND WE NEED ACTION AT THE STATE LEVEL -- FROM THE AGENCIES AND ALSO FROM OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS -- AND IT NEEDS TO BE COMMUNITY CENTER BECAUSE RIGHT -- SO. I THINK AT THE HEART OF THIS IS WE NEED TO DE INCENTIVIZE COMBUSTION WE NEED TO WE NEED TO AS A FORM OF INCENTIVIZING -- ZERO EMISSIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE SIMPLY AND STAFF IN THE PUBLIC. MY NAME IS JESSE MARQUEZ I WAS RAISED ON MY LIFE IN THE COMMITTEE WILMINGTON. I FIRST WANT TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS WE HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING. WE SEE A. B. SIX ONE SEVEN AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND HISTORICAL. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT OF A RB AND THE SOUTH COAST A KENNEDY WITH OUR COMMUNITY. NOTHING IN THE MICROPHONE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER THANK YOU THESE. TWO THESE TWO HAVE BEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. PROGRAMS COMING INTO OUR LIVES. AND WHY DO I TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AN ACTIVIST SINCE I WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD. WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD THE FLETCHER OR REFINERY IN THE CITY OF CARSON ACROSS THE STREET FROM WOMAN CANNELLA SANDERS BLEW UP? SEVEN MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY WERE BURNED FROM FIRST TO THIRD DEGREES OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE BURDEN INJURED. MY MOTHER'S GOING THROUGH CHEMOTHERAPY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND IT RETURNED. MY FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. MY SISTER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER MY SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD NEPHEW LYMPHOMA DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND EVER BROTHER GOING THROUGH CHEMOTHERAPY RIGHT NOW. I TAKE THIS SERIOUS FOR MY FAMILY AND FOR MY COMMUNITIES AND FROM OTHER COMMITTEES I HAVE. BEEN FORTUNATE TO GO MEET THEM. ARE THE SOLUTIONS YES. I WANT AB SIX ONE SEVEN TO BE AN ABSOLUTE SUCCESS AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT SUCCESS. TAKES MY TWENTY YEARS EXPERIENCE IN ALSO TAKE ME BEING A CRITIC TO POINT OUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. FIRST THOUGHT LET'S START OFF WITH THE BASIC LAW. READ THE CLEAN AIR ACT. BASICALLY THE FIRST PAGE I'VE GIVEN YOU SOME DOCUMENTS YOU COULD READ IT BUT IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT. NO WERE IN IT DOES THAT STATE ANYWHERE THAT INDUSTRIES ANY INDUSTRY OR ANY BUSINESS. HAVE ANY RIGHTS THAT SUPERSEDE THE PUBLIC. THEY HAVE NO RIGHTS BUT SUPERSEDE US YET GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HAVE DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THEMSELVES. TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO AND WE WANT THAT STOPPED WE WANT LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT STOPS. OTHER QUESTIONS THAT'LL COME OUT ABOUT EIGHTY SIX SEVEN SIX ONE SEVEN FROM INDUSTRY -- IT'S ONLY STATIONARY. SO IN ONE OF THE PAGES I QUOTE TO SECTION OF AB SIX ONE SEVEN THAT STATE MOLD FORCES ARE INCLUDED. I ALSO INCLUDE SOME PAGES WHAT TOOK ONE EXAMPLE OF CONICAL PHILLIPS OR REFINERY SO ONE PAGE SHOWS YOU. FROM THE YEAR 200-022-00017 ALL THE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS ALL THE TOXIC POLLUTANTS. AND GUESS WHAT YOU DISCOVER. THERE'S BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WHAT SO EVER. AND I CAN TELL YOU WHY. THE GUYS SO BECAUSE THEY CAN BE ADOPTED THE REKLAME PROGRAM AND A RB ADOPTED THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED HIM TO BUY CREDITS. EVERYWHERE ELSE AND NEVER REDUCE POLLUTION. SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THE DATA I'VE TAKEN BUT THEN THEY CAN DEFINE SITE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU A COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE UPDATE IT AND MADE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY SO NOW I HAVE MORE ACCESS TO MORE INFORMATION. BUT THE DATA SHOWS. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT SEVENTEEN YEARS WORTH OF DATA. SEVERAL CATEGORIES A TRACTOR PULLS HAVE GONE UP IN MANY CATEGORIES OF TOXIC POLLUTANTS HAVE GONE UP. WE NEED TO STOP THAT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REDUCING THE FORTUNATELY. I'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO LEARN WHAT OTHER MEMBERS OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND WE HAVE OUR UNIVERSITY SCIENTISTS AND EVEN NEW EMERGING COMPANIES THAT HAVE COME TO US THE SHOW WAS THEIR TECHNOLOGIES. AND WHAT I LEARNED. REFINERY TECHNOLOGIES COULD BE REDUCED AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT. WE CAME UP WITH OUR OWN LITTLE GOALS. IF YOU LOOK AT A CANDY GOALS THEY DO NOT INCLUDE OUR GOALS ARE GOALS IS TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION FROM ALL STATIONARY AND MOST BALL FORCES TWO ZERO EMISSIONS. THAT'S OUR GOAL. OUR SECOND GOAL REDUCE AIR POLLUTION FROM STATION STORIES STATIONARY SOURCES BY 90% IN FIVE YEARS. REDUCE AIR POLLUTION FROM MOBILE FORCES 90% IN SEVEN YEARS. IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH BY 90% WITHIN TEN YEARS. IS THAT ACHIEVABLE ABSOLUTELY YES. BECAUSE TECHNOLOGIES EXIST THEY ARE BE MENTIONED TO YOU ABOUT THE STATUS OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY CLEARING HOUSE. I'VE TALKED AT LEAST THIRTY MEMBER DROP THE OF THE TECHNOLOGY CLEARING HOUSE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING IN THE DOCUMENT I GAVE YOU. ARE A LITTLE ORGANIZATION IS DOING SOMETHING. THAT NO ONE ELSE IS DOING IN LA NO ONE ELSE IS DOING IN CALIFORNIA NO ONE ELSE IS DOING UNITED STATES AND NOWHERE ELSE ON PLANET EARTH WE ARE PROVIDING A MONTHLY SURVEY. OF ALL ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES AND ZERO EMISSIONS EQUIPMENT. BY MANUFACTURER AND MODEL NUMBER. NOW THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE OTHER EQUIPMENT LIKE FOR REFINERIES. VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEMS HAVE EXISTED AND APPROVED BY EPA FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS ARE OFF THE SHELF. BUT NOT ONE TITLE FIGHT PERMIT FROM ANY COMMITTEE MAKES IT MANDATORY FOR EVERY STORAGE TANK SAYS RESULT WE HAVE. HUNDREDS OF TONS OF VOCS COMING OUT. FLARING OUR MAJOR EVENTS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. WE HAVE ALL THESE FIVE SIX POWER OUTAGES. AND THE WORST DAYS ARE THE FLARING DAYS WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT FOR ONE TO ONE AND HALF DAYS. WHAT'S THE SOLUTION. WELL WE KNOW THEY HAD A LIQUID MET BREAK DOWN. BUT IF THEY HAD A BACKUP POWER SYSTEM THERE WE WANT TO HAVE THAT. DO YOU HAVE A GOOD EXAMPLE YES B. B. R. GOING CARSON HAS TO COACH AND PLANTS THAT THEY NEVER GO OUT [inaudible] BUT WHERE IS REQUIREMENTS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TO HAVE A BACKUP POWER IT'S NOT THERE. AND THEY SAY OH FLARING IT'S A FOR SAFETY YOUR WANTED EXPLODING YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO HURT ANYBODY. YOU KNOW WE'RE LOSING PROFITS BURNING OUR FUEL [inaudible] WELL SIMPLE. YOU HAVE THE VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM WHICH IS A PIPE SO IN YOUR GAS IS GO UP THEY GO DIVERT TO PIPE TO AN EMPTY TANK. AND YOU'RE ABLE TO USE IT AGAIN AND YOU DON'T LOSE PROFITS. SO WE KNOW TECHNOLOGIES. AND WE ARE AT THAT LEVEL NOW WHAT WE COULD CONTRIBUTE. TO THE AWARENESS OF WHAT TECHNOLOGIES ARE APPLICABLE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING IN OUR PLAN WE'RE GONNA DATA FIVE SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT. LAST MONTH I SUBMIT A PUBLIC COMMENTS ON SIX OR REFINERIES IN LA THEIR DRAFT FENCE LINE MONITORING PLAN. AND I REJECTED ALL SIX OF THEM. NONE OF THEM WERE A 100% 90% 80% THEY'RE ABOUT 6270% OKAY. WHERE THEY FAILED THE MOST WAS AN PUBLIC NOTIFICATION TO ANYONE PUT IN ANYTHING IN THAT CATEGORY FOR PUBLIC NOTIFICATION? THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE THE GUIDANCE THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO THEY DIDN'T AND THEN WERE USING TECHNOLOGY YES I'M BECOMING VERY AWARE. OF AIR MONITORING EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGIES ONE COMPANY CONTACTED ME AND I CONTACTED THEM. THEY HAVE AN FTIR. THE BEST ONE I CAN READ RIGHT NOW ON PLANET EARTH NOW WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY CAN DETECT THE CHEMICAL AND LESS THAN A MINUTE. THEY CAN QUEUE A VALIDATE THAT DATA IN LESS THAN A MINUTE AND THEY CAN REPORT IT IN LESS THAN ONE MINUTE. THEY STAND FIVE TIMES VERSUS FOUR TIMES. BUT WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT BECAUSE SEE [inaudible] IN TORRANCE. AT THE TORRANCE REFINERY THEY HAVE A CHEMICAL CALLED HYDROGEN FLUORIDE IN WILMINGTON AT THE ALTAR MARVOLO WE HAVE A CHEMICAL CALLED. HYDROGEN FLUORIDE AND IF THAT TANK BREAKS LOOSE. IT KILLS EVERYBODY WITHIN MINUTES. WITHIN TWO MILES. SO HAVING A FIVE TEN MINUTE OR QUARTERLY. NOTIFICATION AS TO WHAT HAPPENED IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. IF THAT BREAKS LOOSE EVERYONE DIES. FIRST THE FOR FIRST RESPONDERS SHOWING UP WILL DIE I INTERVIEWED AND SPOKE A FIVE FIRST RESPONDERS FROM LA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. AVAST EVERYONE OF THEM PRIOR TO THREE YEARS AGO OF THAT EXXONMOBIL REFINERY DID THEY KNOW THAT HOW DO IN FLORIDA WAS THERE THEY ALL SAID NO. AND THAT WAS A FIRST RESPONDER. SO WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED THAT OVER THE YEARS. HM THE STAFF. LIKE YOU HEARD MARK MENTIONED ARE PROPOSING MO USE. NEVER AS ONE E. J. ORGANIZATION AND THE HISTORY OF OUR CALIFORNIA EVER SUPPORTED AND AMMO YOU ARE RECOMMENDED AN AMMO YOU. THESE ARE THEIR STAFFS. POLLUTING WITH INDUSTRY TO GET AWAY WITH THE MINIMUM WE WANT RULES WE WANT REGULATIONS AND WE WANT NEW LAWS THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE. CAN YOU FOR SENATE MILIEU YES SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T WE DON'T WANT TO GO THAT ROUTE BEING CHALLENGED. WE WANT A ROLE WE WANNA REGULATION DO WE ARE PROBLEMS WITH YOU KNOW LAND USE YES. I ASKED AT LEAST THIRTY TO FORTY PLANNERS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THEY LOOK AT YOUR A. R. B.. LAND USE BOOK DID YOU LOOK AT THE A COMMITTEE THAT HIS BOOK. AND THEY SAID NO MAYBE EVEN KNOW IT EXISTED. SO WE NEED. LOS FROM THE LEGISLATORS SAY YES WE NEED TO DO THIS DID YOU KNOW IN RUSSIA FOR REFINERIES THEY HAVE A LAW YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHIN FIVE KILOMETERS AND THEY RELOCATE YOU OUT [inaudible] IT WORKS. AND CAN YOU. OF SOME SOME UP IN. YOU'RE ALSO AT ABOUT TEN MINUTES OKAY SORRY OKAY AND THEN WE ASK TO SEE THE BUDGET WE SAW THE BUDGET TWENTY SEVEN MILLION. SEVEN MILLION WAS BEING ALLOCATED TOWARDS RECLAIM. OUR CSE NEVER DISCUSSED SEVEN MILLION GOING TOWARDS RECLAIM. WE NEVER VOTED OR PROVE DEBT OR EVEN RECOMMENDED IT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT. THAT WAS IN YOUR BUDGET FROM A COMMITTEE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN THEY VOTED TO PHASE IT OUT DON'T TAKE MONEY FROM OUR FUNDS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL -- AND WITH THAT NOW I'LL GO THROUGH THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA. THANK YOU -- ON THE START WITH THE WINGS I WANT. TO BEFORE I ASK MY QUESTION WANT TO MAKE SURE I HEARD YOU COULD KING ABOUT. THE SCOPE OF WHAT THE SOUTH CLOSE DOES. DD SAVE THAT YOU'RE LIMITED TO STATIONARY SOURCES. I HEAR YOU RIGHT OR I SAID WE HAVE PRIMARY AUTHORITY FOR STATIONARY SOURCES. WE HAVE LIMITED AUTHORITY ON MOBILE SOURCES. WE CAN UTILIZE SOME OF CARBS EXISTING AUTHORITY FOR SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES. WE ALSO HAVE LIMITED AUTHORITY WHEN IT COMES TO MOBILE SOURCES THROUGH OUR FLEET RULES. OUR FLEET RULES ARE NOT TAILPIPE STANDARDS WHICH WE ARE NOT. ALLOWED TO ESTABLISH UNDER US LAW THAT IS THE DOMAIN OF CALIFORNIA AT LEAST FOR NOW IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT WE CAN REQUIRE PURCHASING REQUIREMENT FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR PRIVATE FACILITIES THAT ARE CONTRACTED PRIMARILY BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. SO THAT'S ABOUT THE EXTENT OF OUR MOBILE SOURCE THE THIRTY AND WE ALSO HAVE -- INDIRECT SOURCE REAL AUTHORITY THAT IS ACTUALLY. PROBABLY MOST CLEAR WITH REGARDS TO SOUTH COAST AND A BAY AREA MENTIONED THAT. IT WASN'T CLEAR WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE OTHER BUT SOUTH COAST DOES HAVE -- I WOULD SAY LIMITED AUTHORITY WHEN IT COMES. TO OF PORTS AIRPORTS A WAREHOUSING OF RAIL YARDS AND NEW DEVELOPMENT REAL ESTATE. SO I MEAN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO RECOGNIZE [inaudible] OUR WHAT ARE THIRTY DOESN'T DOESN'T ALLOW US TO DO AND THEN NOT HAVE THAT BE WE CAN DO CERTAIN THINGS SO WE CAN FOCUS ON SOMETHING WE HAVE TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT YOU PRESENTED AND THEY ALL I IDENTIFIED. MOBILE SOURCES AS THE BIG ISSUE RIGHT AND SO. INDIRECT SOURCES MIGHT BE A SOLUTION THEN THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY WITHIN THEIR AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE AS REMOVING FORD. THAT IS THE COMMUNITY HAS IDENTIFIED AND IN THIS -- DISTRICT. pTHE TOP ISSUE THEN THAT WE GET CREATIVE -- AND DECIDING PART OF THE PURPOSE OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN IS LET'S LET'S NOT LIMIT OURSELVES THAT'S GET CREATIVE AND THEN THE SECOND PIECE WITHOUT THAT I WANT TO FOR EACH OF THIS COMMITTEES TO DEVELOP THESE CHARTER FOR THESE COMMITTEE SAYS IS. DEVELOPING CONJUNCTION WITH. COMMUNITY GROUPS IS A SOMETHING THAT -- EIGHT HIM HE CAME IN WITH ALREADY -- SO STAFF DRAFTED THE CHARTERS AND THE PRESENTED THEM AS DRAFT TO AND SOUGHT -- FEEDBACK AND INPUT TO YOU SEE VERY LITTLE FEEDBACK AND INPUT ON THE CHARTERS. MASS YEARS ABOUT THAT CHARTER PROCESS [inaudible] YEAH -- MY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CHARTER WITH -- RECEIVING IT. AND AND BEING ASKED TO SIGN IN I DID MISS THE FIRST MEETING -- SO I'M NOT SURE IF THERE WAS A PRESENTATION THERE BUT AT THE SECOND MEETING WHICH WAS THE FIRST MEETING I ATTENDED THAT'S WHERE I RECEIVED THE CHARTER AND AND WAS ASKED TO SIGN. THEY'RE ASKING US JUST SIGN A CHARTER. BUT WE WANT THE SAME RECIPROCAL TRANSPARENCY BACK [inaudible] THAT. I AM I'M AT THIS TABLE BECAUSE I REPRESENT MY COMMUNITY MY COMMUNITY SUPPORTS THE WORK THAT I DO AND I REPORT BACK TO THEM. AND I'M RESPONSIBLE TO THEM. BECAUSE MY FAMILY IS PART OF THAT COMMUNITY AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW YES I'M A LEADER AND YES UP THE TABLE. EVERYTHING IS TO BE DISCUSSED AT THE TABLE. I WANT TO BE A CO WRITER OF THAT CHARTER. WE SUBMITTED A DOCUMENT. FOR DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST SO WE HAVE TO DRAFT IN THE FORM THAT IT WILL COULD FILL OUT THERE WAS NOTHING PARTICULAR DANGEROUS ABOUT IT. AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT -- WELL SOME OF THE WORK FOR INDUSTRY WELL YES BUT THEY'RE GONNA BE VOTING AGAINST US. THE ONES THAT ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR JOBS. SO YES YOU KNOW WE WERE DISCUSS EVERYTHING GOLDEN APRIL DISCUSS GETTING UP PURCHASING EQUIPMENT FOR AIR QUALITY MONITORING. WE HAVE A DISCUSS OUR COMMITTEE MONITORING NEEDS YET AND WHAT EQUIPMENT WE WANT YET. WE MAY WANT TO INPUT ON THAT. YEAH -- MY EXPENSES CHARTER IS PRESENTED AT THE FIRST -- COMMITTEE MEETING WE'RE ASKED TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK BY THE NEXT COMMUNITY MEETING I BELIEVE SOME OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS DID PROVIDE SOME FEEDBACK ALTHOUGH I THINK IT JUST SPEAKS TO A HIGHER ISSUE. IN THAT A LOT OF THIS IS BEING DISTRICT DRIVEN AND NOT COMMUNITY DRIVEN. ON THE AND THANK YOU FOR THAT MATTER I MEAN I'M TRYING TO GET AT THAT POINT I I HAVE TO I APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T GET TO HEAR THE PRESENTATIONS EARLIER BECAUSE MY OTHER PASSION -- TALKING ABOUT MY PRE TO THE SOUTH UP IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE. THANK YOU -- BUT I I I I APPRECIATE SOME OF YOU WERE ABLE TO COME TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF TIME. ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND I I DON'T EXPECT EVERY DISTRICT TO BE THE SAME AND AND I EXPECTED TO BE GROWING PAINS ACROSS THE BOARD. BUT IN SOME DISTRICTS THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A MUCH MORE COLLABORATIVE -- TEAM EFFORT AND FROM THE THIRTY COMMUNITY GROUPS HERE THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCONNECT AND SO I I PICKED ON THE CHARTER SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS MEANT. TWO OF OF THE LIST EVEN THAT A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS OF HOW WE WORK TOWARDS BUILDING THAT TRUST I THINK AND MY COMMUNITY I'VE SEEN OTHER LACK OF TRUST. AND SO EVERY STEP IS GOING TO BE PAINFUL AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA REQUIRED A LOT OF EXTRA WORK BUT I THINK EVERY STEP THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO BUILD THAT TRUST AND GETTING THE CHARTER GOING MIGHT BE PART OF AND I THINK I SENATE-DISTRICT YOU HAVE A DEADLINE THEY HAVE TO MEETING YOUR SEEN THAT SO YOU'RE TRYING TO BE LIKE LET ME MAKE SURE I DO WHAT I CAN NOW TO HELP. MEET THAT DEADLINE AND MAYBE THERE'S WERE GREAT COULD DO AT A TIME. BUT SOMETIMES THAT BEEN WORKS AGAINST US IN IN THE LONG HAUL AND IN THE COMMITMENT FROM THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS I DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT WITH MATT -- ABOUT THE POWER OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN YEAR READ OF HOW IT WAS IT WAS -- VOTED ON AND WHAT I HAD TO LEVERAGE -- BUT BUT IT'S IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IF I HAVE BY IN FROM MY COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND IT WORRIES ME THAT ARE HAVE BY IN IN IN ULTIMATELY IS LIKE WHAT DO I NEED TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO REFINE THIS PROCESS. TO GET THAT BY IN AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT MORE OF WHAT THEY WANT IS IS BEING INCLUDED IN I TELL MY COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE NOT GOING TO GET IT ALL. RIGHT AND IT'S A DOWN PAYMENT IT WILL KEEP FIGHTING FOR FOR A BETTER BUT IT DOES WORRY ME THAT IN SOME [inaudible] AND I I HAVE HOPE IT'S NOT PERFECT IN THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO SEE AND THEN I'M HEARING HERE IN THE SOUTH COAST REGION. I WOULD ENACTED THIS IS ALL SIXTEEN AND I DON'T HEAR A LOT OF HOPE HERE ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- AND SO THAT'S WHY I PICKED ON THE CHARTER I DON'T KNOW THERE'S MORE PIECES OUT THERE BUT I THINK EVERY STEP IS A STEP. TO BEST BUILD THAT TRUST AND WHILE WE HAVE A REAL DEADLINE. SOMETIMES WE CAN'T WE SHOULD BE GETTING AHEAD OF OURSELVES. AND IN THAT PROCESS -- AND ARE WORTH MATTER AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL I ALSO WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE MONETARY -- BECAUSE IT'S BEEN AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN EQUITY FOR QUITE AWHILE FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE NOT JUST IN THIS REGION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT LEASE PRO PURPLE MONITORS OR WHETHER OR NOT WE SEE MONITORS THAT ARE. CERTIFIED AND APPROVED BY THE FED TO WE HAVE THAT ENFORCEMENT DOWN THE ROAD -- AND WHY ARE WE NOT DOING I AND I GET THE COST ISSUE THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT LOST ON ME. BUT IF IF I INVEST WHATEVER MONO PROBLEM MONITORS AND IT'S NOT THE END OF THAT IS GOING TO MEAN ANYTHING FOR ENFORCEMENT. WHY AREN'T WE DOING A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE DATA THAT THAT WILL MEAN SOMETHING FOR ENFORCEMENT? THANK YOU SOMEONE EVER GARCIA OF PHILIP FINE SO -- WE WE ARE NOT ONLY RELYING ON THE LOW COST SENSORS IT'S AN ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH SO WENT AND DID THE THE WE HAVEN'T FINISHED IS MONITORING PLANS YET TIME IS SHORT WE HAVE TO START PURCHASING SOME EQUIPMENT THAT WE WE DO THINK IT'S GOING TO BE USEFUL. LOW COST MONITORING VERSES REGULATORY MONITORING IT IS BOTH THEY BOTH SERVE DIFFERENT PURPOSES IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PUT A THOUSAND REGULATORY MONITORS OUT IN ONE COMMUNITY. THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU'RE RESOURCES IT'S GOING TO DO THAT BUT YOU CAN PUT FIVE OR SIX OR MAYBE MORE THAN THAT BUT THE FILL OUT THAT GAP. YOU PUT IN LOW COST MONITORS IF THEY SHOW A PROBLEM YOU COULDN'T MOVE THE REGULATORY MONITOR THEIR SO IT'S IT'S THEIR DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT REASONS DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES DIFFERENT THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. WITH MONITORING. SO HOW MANY JUST THEN AND THAT'S FAIR -- LIKE LET'S SAY IN THE LIMITING IN WILMINGTON WAS LONG BEACH CARSON. AREA COMMUNITY OR WE HAVE A STEERING GROUP HOW MANY OF THE OF THESE FEDERALLY. REGULATED MONITORS ARE WE PUTTING THERE. ARE DO WE HAVE A TO DO WE HAVE FIVE DO WE HAVE NINE YET SO AS I SAID THE MODERN PLANTS AREN'T COMPLETE YET BECAUSE WE'RESTILL TAKING INPUT AND TRYING TO MATCH THE MONITORING PROGRAM WITH THE EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROGRAM. SUCH THAT WE CAN TRACK PROGRESS AND MAKE AND SO AT AND WE HAVE MET MONITORING AND OTHER SO. TIME IS SHORT WAS SUPPOSED TO START MONITORING ON JULY FIRST -- THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE THAT'S WITHIN THE STATUTE AND AGAIN IT'S A SURE THE FRUSTRATION WITH -- ALL THE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE THAT WERE READY TO GO ON DAY ONE WITH WITH MEASURES AND ACTIONS BECAUSE WE WERE. TOO IT IS WE HAVE A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO BRING EVERYONE UP -- TO THAT CONSENSUS. CONSENSUS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD -- AND AGAIN THAT THE TIME LINES ARE TIGHT ON MONITORING THE TIME LINES EVEN TIGHTER. SO -- IT IS A CHALLENGE BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GET A BASIC LEVEL OF MONITORING OUT THERE. AND WAS WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP THOSE MONITORING PLANS. IN AND IF I HAD TO YOU KNOW VICE FOR EXAMPLE. MAYBE THERE WAS WORK THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE EARLIER ON THE MONITORING SITE THAT WAS YOU KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN SAYING. FOR TOO MANY YEARS I'VE BEEN AROUND AND THEY'VE BEEN AROUND LONGER THAN I HAVE ISSUING DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE BUT I WILL SAY THAT THESE MONITORS IN THE TYPE OF MINERS THAT WERE YOU SEEN EVEN BEFORE AB. SIX SEVENTEEN WAS TALKED ABOUT WITH AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE AND A FRUSTRATION AMONG THE COMMUNITY AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN A PLACE WHERE MAYBE WE CAN ABOUT AND I HAD. ON THAT PIECE -- A LITTLE BIT AND SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE WE A CENTER DISTRICT YOU HAVE A SKILL SET AND SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD TO GET AHEAD AND SOMETHING'S BUT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. A BETTER PLACE TO TO GET AHEAD. ON A SOME OF THE MONETARY IN OUT THERE I I WILL SAY TO THE COMMUNITY I DO THINK WE NEED A PLAN. I DO THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S A PLACE FOR THOSE PURPLE MONITORS -- BUT THERE'S ALSO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF I HAD DATA THAT I COULD GET ENFORCEMENT WENT THAT AND I REALIZE THAT THE REALITY SETTLES FOR PER MONITOR DATA DOESN'T GIVE ME ENFORCEMENT SO. I I DO AGREE THAT WE NEED A PLANNED AND A BALANCE AND AND SEND THAT PART. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- THESE HEARINGS AND THAT BRING IN AND OTHER ISSUES WHETHER IT'S AB THREE NINETY EIGHT AND CAP AND TRADE EVEN IF IT'S NOT GERMANE EVEN THOUGH THE HISTORY IS TIED. OR A TAX -- FOR THE DISTRICT -- AND SO I WILL TAKE A MOMENT ON THAT TAX FOR THEIR WHEN WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS PIECE. OF THE PIE IN THIS PIECE OF OF THE EQUATION -- AND WHEN THERE'S ALSO THE ABILITY -- TO AND FROM FOURTH AND IMPOSE OTHER FEES THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO BE TAXES ON POLLUTERS OUT THERE -- IN SOME OUT I'LL TAKE THAT SOAPBOX FOR A MOMENT THANK YOU. SOME MEMBERS TO CHECK THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APOLOGIZE THAT STEP OUT. TO TAKE ANOTHER MEETING -- ON THE MOST -- TO DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE PORTION OF TODAY'S AGENDA -- TO TO TO MY DISTRICT BUT I HOPE BY -- PLEASE -- EXCUSE ME IF I ASK SOMETHING THAT AND THAT WAS COVERED -- DURING MY ABSENCE -- MY PRIMARY CONCERN OUR REFINERIES -- YOU HAVE THE THE PRIMARY AUTHORITY FOR STATIONARY SOURCES INCLUDING REFINERIES -- I SAW GREAT PROMISE WITH THE THAT THE BARK PROVISIONS OF REDUCING -- I AIR AIR POLLUTION AND I GUY HEARD YOUR PRESENTATION ON THE ROLE DEVELOPMENT -- PROCESS AS IT RELATES TO REFINERIES BUT IT WOULD BE A A MY IN MY UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY THAT YOU -- THAT THE FINAL ROLE AS TO ADOPTING BART. TECHNOLOGIES -- AS IT RELATES TO A REFINERY BEING WORKED ON YEAH WE HOPE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR TO HAVE -- LET'S SPECIFIC WILL FOR BARKED KNOCKS EMISSIONS AT REFINERIES IN PLACE -- TO REQUIRE THE BEST AVAILABLE CONTROLS OBVIOUSLY WON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT THERE'S HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE -- DOING THE BEST WE CAN HIT THE DEADLINE IN STATUTE AT THE FOR THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WILL WE'RE WORKING ON FOR REFINERIES -- WE AS PART OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE -- WE WANT TO DISCUSS BRINGING OUR RULE ELEVEN EIGHTEEN BACK WHICH IS OUR RULE THAT IS INTENDED TO REDUCE FLARING EMERGENCY FIRINGS ALREADY PROHIBITED I MEAN THAT. WE CAN CLEARING SAUDI PROHIBITED BUT HOW CAN WE REDUCE EMERGENCY AND NON ROUTINE FLARING. SO THERE'S ANOTHER ROLE -- COMING BACK THERE AND THERE'S THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER RULES WERE LOOKING AT OBVIOUSLY FOURTEEN TEN FOUR REFINERIES. SO OTHERS THAT THERE'S A WHOLE REGULATORY PROGRAM COMING FORWARD ON REFINERIES ALL RIGHT SO AS TO THE WITH THE MAIN ROLE ON REFINERIES THAT'S THAT YOUR YOUR YOUR GOAL RIGHT NOW IS TO HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. UP FOR THE BARK REQUIREMENTS YES FOR THE BARK REQUIREMENTS OKAY. SO -- I I I I KNOW THAT WHEN WE WERE DEBATING -- THIS BILL AS WELL AS THE BUDGET BILL LAST YEAR THAT ONE OF THE THE CONCERNS WAS NOT HAVING A ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL BUT AT HOW IS THAT GOING. WELL I YOU KNOW I I THINK. WE WERE CONCERNED JUST ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION WELL THE BILL WAS FIRST COMING FORWARD ABOUT ALL THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD TO HIRE AT LEAST FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED NEW STAFF TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM PART OF THAT IS ENFORCEMENT. PART OF THAT IS NEW INSPECTORS TO DO ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT'S EXPECTED TO COME OUT OF THE PROCESS -- SO FOR AT LEAST YOU'RE WANTING YOUR TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY WITH THAT ENOUGH. WHEN COULD SPEAK TO THAT BUT IT WASN'T QUITE ENOUGH TO COVER EVERYTHING WE NEED THAT LEVEL OF FUNDING GOING FORWARD WE THINK IT'S ABOUT A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR PROGRAM JUST IN SOUTH COAST? TO MOVE FORWARD TO BRING NEW COMMUNITIES IN AND HAVE THAT THAT. DADDY MARCH FORWARD TO BRING NEW COMMUNITIES IN AN AND OF IMPLEMENTING PLANS AND PREVIOUS COMMUNITIES -- TO WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED FUNDING FOR TWO YEARS AND HOPEFULLY IN THE COMING YEAR AS WELL. ALL RIGHT SO SO ENTER IN TERMS OF A LIKE. FOCUSING ON THE TORCH REFINERY MY DISTRICT I MEAN WHAT WHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE. THE THIS AIR POLLUTION REDUCING TECHNOLOGY BEING -- INSTALLED AND AND PUT TO USE -- IT SO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER BUT REFINERIES ARE COMPLEX -- ORGANISMS AND YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAVE TURN AROUND SCHEDULES HAVE DIFFERENT SCHEDULES SO THE THINGS THEY CAN DO FOR IT QUICKLY WE WON'T REQUIRE THEM TO DO QUICKLY AND THE THINGS THAT NEED MORE TIME WILL TAKE MORE TIME. OUR GOALS AND MAXIMIZING THE EARLY REDUCTIONS SO WHATEVER WE CAN. REQUIRE THEM TO DO EARLY WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE LARGEST EMITTING EQUIPMENT -- AND MAKE SURE WE GET THOSE BENEFITS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE -- TO BE TO BE MONITORED YEAH A OR D. FOOT FOR THE CONTROLS TO GO ON SURE OKAY -- IT. AM I CORRECT IN UNDERSTANDING THAT. THAT THE FLARING -- INCIDENTS -- GO. BECAUSE THE SPIKES IN IN IN THE THE THE THE AIR POLLUTION -- THAT -- THAT AB SIX SEVENTEEN IS IS TRYING TO TARGET. THEY CAN -- SO AGAIN ROUTINE FLARING IS NOT ALLOWED IT ONLY HAPPENS EITHER. FOR EMERGENCY REASONS WHICH ARE USUALLY THOSE BIG FLARES THAT EVERYONE SEES ON THE NEWS AND AND AND JESSE IS TALKING ABOUT -- ALSO THERE IS SOME WHAT'S KNOWN AS NANA. NANA TEEN FLARING WHEN THEY WERE DOING CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AND DOING TURNAROUNDS IN MAINTAINING EQUIPMENT -- IT IT'S FOR THE NON ROUTINE FLARING I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE AND JESSE MENTIONED SOME OF THEM ENHANCING THE VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEMS TO HAVE MORE CAPACITY -- FOR THE EMERGENCY FLARING SOMETIMES THAT'S TOUGH BUT I THINK WE CAN WE CAN DO A LOT OF WORK ABOUT. A PUBLIC NOTIFICATION AND VAPOR RECOVERY IS ONE THING BUT AT SOME POINT THAT MAY RUN OUT SO THEY MIGHT HAVE TO BE A FLARE BUT WHAT CAN WE DO WITH MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT AND AND MAKING SURE THE PUBLIC KNOWS. WITH WHAT WITH YOU BEING EXPOSED -- TO SO IN SOME CASES YES THAT WE HAVE SEEN -- SHORT TERM INCREASES WITH ESPECIALLY DURING THOSE LARGER FLYING OF AND THINGS BUT IT. YEAH ON THAT AND THEN AGAIN. DUE. TO YOUR BILL ASSEMBLY MAN -- AB -- SIXTEEN FORTY SEVEN THERE'S GONNA BE FENCE LINE MONITORING AT ALL OUR REFINERIES -- WE WE PASSED INTO OUR WILL ELEVEN EIGHTY BY THE ENDOF THIS YEAR AS WELL AS COMMUNITY MONITORING -- IN THE COMMUNITIES AROUND REFINERIES WHICH OVERLAPS. WITH THE A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES IN MANY PLACES -- SO THAT IS ALL HAPPENING IN PARALLEL EMPLOYMENT AB SIX SEVENTEEN OR SO WHEN TO EXPECT THOSE MONITORS TO BE UP AND RUNNING. THE DEADLINE IN THE BILL WHICH IS THE END OF THIS YEAR. OKAY -- SO. I I I GUESS I I I I SHARE MY THE THE THE FRUSTRATION THAT WAS EXT EXPRESSED EARLIER IN THIS HEARING BY. MS GORDAN FROM WEST OAKLAND THAT -- YOU KNOW WE WE WE WE GET THESE REPORTS FROM THE H. M. D. AS TO YOU KNOW -- WENT WHEN THE THE FLARING IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND AND AND WE GET THESE REPORTS ON HOW MUCH KNOCKS AND AND AND AND AND ALL THIS OTHER NASTY STUFF IS IS GOING TO BE MADE IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT YOU KNOW. WELL I I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT -- THAT THEY DID THAT THE COMMUNITY IS IS IT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN WE SEE THESE DRAMATIC FLARES -- IT -- IT JUST HEIGHTENS THE THE THE THE THE CONCERN -- IS SO WHAT WITH THIS VAPOR REDUCTION IS THAT PART OF THE BARK TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEING. CONSIDERED [inaudible] IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE PARK IT IS NOT NECESSARILY CONTROL TECHNOLOGY IN THAT SENSE BUT WE DO WANT TO COME BACK WITH OUR FLARE REDUCTION RULE. AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO AND ONE OF THE POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN DO THAT IS. THEY DO HAVE PAPER RECOVERY SYSTEMS -- BUT THE MAYBE THEY CAN BE ENHANCED IT'LL -- LARGER CAN HANDLE MORE VOLUME SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE IN A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN CONTEXT TO HELP DEVELOP THAT -- IT WOULD APPLY TO ALL REFINERIES BUT YOU KNOW OUR MAJOR REFINERIES ARE MOSTLY IN THAT -- ONE COMMUNITY. AM I CORRECT IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THE TORRANCE REFINERY WAS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY FIND -- REFINERIES AN INJURED JURISDICTION. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT FINDS OVERALL I KNOW THEY HAVE PAID -- THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF MITIGATION FEES FOR EXCESS FLARING IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BY FAR. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE THE SPECIFIC I DON'T HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT NUMBERS ARE COMMITTED AND LARGER. SO THOSE MEDICATION FEES ARE SEPARATE FROM THE THE ENHANCED PENALTIES THAT -- WERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE AN ACTOR PURSUANT AB. SIX SEVENTY YES YEAH THAT'S RIGHT IN PLACE AT THE TIME. SO ARE. OUR OUR THEIR ENHANCED PENALTIES FROM A NINETEEN THAT. THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO ADDRESS -- THE EXCESSIVE WEARING AT THE TORRANCE REFINERY. LET'S SAY THAT IF THERE'S A VIOLATION TO BE FOUND THEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE THE ADDITIONAL PENALTIES THAT WERE BROUGHT OUT BY. SIX SEVENTEEN BUT THE MEDICATION ASPECT THAT TO TALK TO FIND WAS REFERRING TO IS KILEY WITHIN I WILL STRUCTURE. SO WHERE WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO INVOKE THE HIGHER PENALTIES WE WILL. AIMING JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE DIDN'T INCREASES MITIGATION FEES. OR LIFTED A CAP ON THE APPLICATION FEES. SO IN IN IN IN TERMS OF THE HAVE ANY OF THE ENHANCED PENALTIES UNDER AB SIX SEVENTEEN BEEN APPLIED TO THE TORRANCE REFINERY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE THE OR THE THE THE SIGNING OF THE BILL INTO THE INTO LAW. I CANNOT RECALL A VIOLATION AT THE TORRANCE REFINERY SINCE THAT TIME. THERE HAVE BEEN POWER FAILURES AND OTHER ISSUES. OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE A VIOLATION THAT RESULTS FROM THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE ONGOING OKAY. SO SO -- IT TO DATE THE THE THE PRIMARY HE ON THE TORRANCE REFINERY FOR ITS EXCESSIVE FLARING HAS BEEN FROM THESE MEDICATION FEES. THEY REALLY SEPARATE. THE MITIGATION FEES VERSES THE PENALTIES AND PENALTIES WOULD COME AFTER THE VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN DETERMINED. AND THEN WE WOULD ENTER AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ACTUAL REFINERY ON THOSE. HI I GUESS I'M LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF INCENTIVE OR A CARROT OR A STICK -- FOR THE TORTURE FINERY TO CUT DOWN ON ALL OF THE EXCESSIVE -- FLARING. AND I I I DON'T HEAR YOU KNOW -- MUCH OF A A CARROT OR A STICK HERE YOU CAN CAN YET AND CAN HELP THESE. SORRY THE STATE WILL BE OUR RETURN TO RULE ELEVEN EIGHTEEN OKAY THAT WOULD BE THE STATE NOW THAT WILL ALSO HAS. I GUESS REVERSE CARE IT BECAUSE IF THEY GO ABOVE SOME LIMITS -- THEN THEY HAVE TO PAY THESE MITIGATION FEES -- WHETHER THAT CONTINUES IN THE ROLE GOING FORWARD AND WE JUST HAVE A STAKE IN SOMETHING THAT WILL LOOK AT WHEN WE OPEN THAT RULE AGAIN. AND SO YOU EXPECT THE THE ADOPTION OF THE REVISED RULE ELEVEN EIGHTEEN BY THE END OF THIS YEAR -- PROBABLY NEXT YEAR AGAIN WE WE WANT TO HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS LIKE JESSE WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE. AND HAS LOOKED INTO THESE TECHNOLOGIES WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY GROUPS WITHIN AB -- SIX SEVENTEEN TO HELP DEVELOP IDEAS FOR THAT WILL PUT THAT IN THE COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PLAN MAKE A COMMITMENT TO COME BACK IN. AND THEN. JUST LIKE WE DO IN OUR CALL ON THAT RULE AS PART IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN [inaudible] OKAY. MAY I I JUST LIKE TO SUM UP I MEAN I YOU KNOW MAYBE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TELL THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE FACING BUT IT BUT I I I'M I'M SEEING THINGS FROM THE COMMUNITIES PERSPECTIVE THAT DATE. THAT YOU'RE YOU YOU'VE BEEN CONDUCTING A A LT OF THESE COMMUNITY OUTREACH ACTIVITIES AND YOU KNOW I KNOW I I GET ALL OF YOUR YOUR EMAILS. BUT I DON'T SEE THINGS CHANGING. AND AND I THINK THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE FOR PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY -- AND SO I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY FRUSTRATION THANK YOU. CAN I CAN IS A QUESTION OF CARD. EARLIER I SAID ACT AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU LATER WHEN THE PRESENTATIONS ARE. ARE GOING ON IF WE'RE FINISHED WITH THIS PANEL WHY DON'T WE DO HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR ITS RELATED TO THIS PANEL I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO STAY. NOW THIS OR MAYBE THEY MAYBE SOME FOM CARP COME UP TO THE MIKE THAT MICROPHONE TO BRIEFLY ANSWER QUESTIONS. I MEAN IT'S IT'S THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A COMMUNITY DRIVEN PROCESS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR DISTRICTS AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WORD PARTNERSHIP WITH THIRD DISTRICTS. AND IN SOME PLACES ARE FOR YOUR IN THAT OUT BETTER THAN OTHERS IS THERE A ROLE FOR CARBON NOW AND NOT LATER NOT WITH THE SECOND ROUND OF COMMUNITIES TO BE A BRIDGE. TO HELP CREATE A BETTER PROCESS IN SOME OF THESE CASES ROOM I HAVE A BREAK DOWN. IS THERE A ROLE FOR YOU CARVE WHATEVER'S ARCHIVE TO BE THE BRIDGE. TO WHOEVER YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT IS SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A BETTER PARTNERSHIP SAY HEY I'M I'M SEEN. THREE COMMUNITIES HERE THAT HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL BUT ALSO A LOT OF FRUSTRATION FROM THE TWO SIDES IS THERE A WAY FOR CARP TO BE A BRIDGE. TO CREATE A BETTER PROCESS NOW AND NOT LATER AND NOT TO SAY I'M GONNA LEARN FROM THIS SO THAT THE NEXT THING COMMUNITIES HAVE A BETTER. HOW DO WE MAKE THESE COMMUNITIES BETTER NOW AS YOU'VE ALREADY HAVE RECOGNIZED? FROM EACH COMMUNITY ISSUES ARE DIFFERENT RIGHT THE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE SOURCES THE COMMUNITY CONCERNS. AND WHAT YOU HEARD FROM ME EARLIER IS TO EFFECTIVELY MOVE FORWARD AND GET REAL REDUCTIONS UNDER THIS PROGRAM. IT REALLY IS COLLABORATION WITH THE DISTRICT AND WITH THE COMMUNITY SO TO YOUR DIRECT QUESTION THERE'S RECEPTIVITY TO SIT DOWN AND LESS WORK THROUGH WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE THESE ARE TOUGH ISSUES SEVERAL THAT WHICH ARE. DISCUSSED BECAUSE A NUMBER OF POINTS WERE RAISED I HEARD THE LAND USE COMMENT WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT ISSUE. WE NEED TO HAVE AN HONEST% CONVERSATION ON AN ACT BALLS NOT JUST THE DISTRICT IN THE COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES. THAT INVOLVES THE CITY THAT INVOLVES LOCAL PLANNING DECISIONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF THE ISSUE THAT I THINK HAS BEEN SET ASIDE FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT IS IS THAT. AS WE'RE FOCUSING ON REDUCING EMISSIONS AND SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES. THE OBVIOUS QUESTION THAT COMES THE REST BRINGS THE FOR IS. HOW DID THAT COMMUNITY GET CREATED IN THE FIRST PLACE WHY IS THAT WAREHOUSE LOCATED IN A RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY WISE THAT CHROME PLATER? NEAR THE HOME THE ABSOLUTE ANSWER THAT QUESTION THE LAND USE DECISION. AND WE CAN CRAFT I'M CONVINCED OF THIS IN TERMS OF GETTING REAL REDUCTIONS AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. BUT WE SHOULD BE ASKING OURSELVES HOW DO WE AVOID CREATING NEW SEVENTY SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES. WE'VE GOT HELP LOCAL CITY AND LOCAL SAYS THAT'S PART OF THIS TO ENTERS WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO ASK CARP TO COME IN AND BE A BRIDGE IN ALL FAIRNESS ALL PARTIES INCLUDING MY COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE VERY FASCINATING TO BE OPEN TO THAT TO THAT BRIDGE -- AND IN THAT INCLUDES THE RESPONSES HERE BUT ALSO WITH THOSE AGENCIES SO THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING THE LINE USE ISSUE WHICH KEEPS POPPING UP IN ALL OF THESE I MEAN I THINK. THAT THAT'S THE POSITIVE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR ALL THESE YEARS BUT WE'RE ALSO KNOCKS. SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT THIS LINE IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS DISCUSSION ON THAT WE NEED TO BE ELEVATING HERE. SOME IF I COULD. THE CARD HAS BEEN A GREAT PARTNER WITH US AT THESE COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND WE GENERALLY HAVE ANYWHERE FROM. I'LL SAY TWO TO FOUR CAR BOARD MEMBERS. TO PARTICIPATE AT THESE BOARD MEETINGS. IN FACT IN ONE OF THE MOST RECENT BOARD MEETINGS A CARB STAFF MY UNDERSTANDING HAS AGREED TO COME BACK. AND PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND TO ACT MORE AS THAT COLLABORATIVE ASPECT. BUT IT TRULY IS THAT PARTNERSHIP IN AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE HEARING FROM ONE OF EACH OF US YOU KNOW WE HAVE OVER THIRTY MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. SIX SEVENTEEN IS NOT BEING DONE IN -- MANY OTHER PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED THAT A PART OF THAT. AND SO I JUST SORT OF ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THAT AS WITH ME FOR BUT WE REMAIN COMMITTED. TO WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP. TO DOING ALL THESE THINGS AND RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE AND AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO TAKE TO HEART WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE TIMING. BECAUSE I TAKE THOSE DEADLINES VERY SERIOUSLY AND I TAKE THE ASPECT OF TRYING TO GET THOSE REDUCTIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND IF IT'S ON THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR WE KNOW WHAT'S THERE. IF IT'S A QUESTION OF WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE LET'S HAVE THAT DISCUSSION. BECAUSE WHILE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE AVAILABLE AND YOU CAN ORDER IT YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. LET'S LET'S HAVE THAT DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF GETTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE GETTING THE TECHNOLOGY IN PLACE AND REALLY UNDERSTANDING. WHAT ARE THE TIME HORIZONS BEFORE WE START ACTUALLY REALIZING THOSE BENEFITS IN LIGHT OF OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT MIGHT GIVE US? MORE REDUCE EMISSIONS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER BUT NOT NECESSARILY GET IS TO ZERO AND WE ALL AGREE. FROM A CLIMATE AND QUITE TO RIPPLING PERSPECTIVE ZERO WAS WHERE WE NEED TO BE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. OKAY MOVING ON TO PORT SIDE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN DIEGO. WE HAVE BOB CARD OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT AND DIANE TALK FLORIAN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH COALITION. YOU WILL EACH HAVE EIGHT MINUTES THANK YOU [inaudible] SO GOOD EVENING CHAIR FRIEDMAN MY NAME IS BOB CARD OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT I BROUGHT WITH ME ALSO ANNOUNCES JOHN ADAMS THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR -- HE'S VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE HE'S BEEN THE LEAD PERSON. IN THIS PROGRAM THE SIX ONE SEVEN PROGRAM. AND SO HERE TO DO A BRIEF PRESENTATION AND OF COURSE ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS AND DIANNE TECH FOREIGN WILL HAVE. THANKS TO SAY AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE IT'S MUCH APPRECIATED. SO THE COMMUNITY OF PORT SIDE ENVIRONMENTAL IN BURLEY DISADVANTAGED NEIGHBORHOODS THAT'S A MOUTHFUL -- AS YOU SEE UP. ON THE MAP ACTUALLY WHAT YOU HAVE IS ON THE RIGHT THIRTY SEVEN CENSUS TRACKS AS DETERMINED BY COLIN VIRUS SCREEN. FAR UPPER RIGHT ON THAT ONE IS THE BLUE -- ELCA HONE AREA AND THEN MOVING DOWN YOU'LL SEE THE CHULA VISTA AREA AND YELLOW AT THE BOTTOM AND THERE'S A DARK BLUE AREA -- WHICH IS THE PORT SIDE COMMITTEE IS AS WE'VE IDENTIFIED IT WORKING WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED IS LEADING UP THE STREET COMMITTEE WE HAD ABOUT. SIX COMMUNITY MEETINGS. WITH -- DIANE TECH FOR IN AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE TO DISCUSS WHAT THEY FELT THEIR NEEDS WERE HOW WE NEED TO APPROACH THIS AND IT NEVER REALLY VALUABLE BECAUSE WE ALSO LEARNED. THAT PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO TO CALL IF THERE'S A COMPLAINT AND THAT'S BEEN A BIG IMPROVEMENT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HELP OUT IN THAT REGARD. SO ON THE LEFT OR THE TWELVE CENSUS TRACTS OF THE THIRTY SEVEN THAT ARE PART OF OF THE SIX ONE SEVEN COMMUNITY THE PORTS LIKE ME THAT CARP HAS CHOSEN. AND WE THINK IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO START WE HAVE A LOT MORE WE'RE GONNA DO AS I MENTIONED IN A MINUTE. BUT WHAT WE HAVE FOR THE PORT SIDE COMMITTEE IS LOGAN HEIGHTS BAR LOGAN AND WEST NATIONAL CITY AND AGAIN THAT'S THE DARK BLUE AREA BOTH IN SMALL ON THE RIGHT AND AND LARGER FORMAT ON THE LEFT. OTHER AREAS WE'RE CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN OUR SANTA SEE THROUGH TO LIVE IS TO THE REMAINDER OF NATIONAL CITY -- AT EL CAJON WE WE ANTICIPATE LOOKING AT THESE AREAS EVEN MORE AND I'LL TALK A MINUTE ABOUT MOLD WONDERING WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY OUT AND ABOUT ALREADY STARTING ON MARCH ONE DOING SOME MONITORING. SO WE GET UP THE NEXT SLIDE -- THAT'S ME HOW. SO WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE THAT FORMED -- WE HAVE IT A TWENTY FOUR MEMBER JOHN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR MEMBERS TWELVE OF WHOM ARE RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEN THERE ARE A VARIETY OF OTHER PEOPLE WERE LOOKING TO ADD SOME MEMBERS. SO IT IS NOT JUST AN EVEN SPLIT BUT MORE THE RESIDENTS WILL BE IN THE MAJORITY THERE -- INCLUDING A MEDICAL DOCTOR PORTER SAN DIEGO'S THERE THE INFORMAL HEALTH COALITION. EVEN THE INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTAL SO SHE'S IN MANY OTHERS AND IT'S BEEN A REALLY COLLABORATIVE EFFORT FRANKLY WHEN YOU SEE THESE MEETINGS AND JOHN IS THE ONE WHO LEADS THESE -- IT'S COLLABORATIVE THERE'S A LOT OF INTERACTION AND I THINK REALLY THE OUTCOMES ARE VERY GOOD IN TERMS OF WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO NOT ONLY MONITOR BUT EVENTUALLY PROTECT FOLKS ARE EMISSION REDUCTION. ACTIVITIES -- AND WE WERE CHOSEN BY THE STATE TO INITIALLY JUST TO THE ASSESSMENT NOT TO DO EMISSION REDUCTIONS RIGHT AWAY BUT I WILL TALK IN A MINUTE ABOUT HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY ALREADY DOING SOME EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT IN THE AREA -- SO WITH THE MONITORING PLANS WE'RE GONNA BE DOING A VARIETY OF THINGS WE WE'RE GONNA MONITOR -- WE HOPE BETWEEN TWELVE AND FIFTEEN LOCATIONS WITH STATIONARY EQUIPMENT AND THIS IS A REFERENCE METHOD OF MEASURES NOT PORTABLE MONGERS PER SE BUT TRANSPORTABLE. SO FIRST ALL ON THE RIGHT AS I MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO WE HAVE A COMPANY ALL RIGHT NOW AS OF MARCH. ONE DRIVING JOHN YOU SAID ALL THE ALL THIRTY SEVEN CENSUS TRACKS YES OKAY ALL THIRTY SEVEN CENSUS TRACKS WITH A PORTABLE MONITOR. AND THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT PARTICULATE MATTER OZONE NITROGEN OXIDES CARBON MONOXIDE AND CO. TWO OF JUST TO SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE TO GIVE US A SNAPSHOT IF YOU WILL IN THEIR DRIVING EACH ROAD TWENTY TIMES IN THE THIRTY SEVEN CENSUS TRACKS. TO SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE TO SEE WHERE WE NEED TO BE LOOKING EVEN IF WE'RE NOT CURRENTLY IN THAT AREA WORSE FOR IN THE PORTS LIKE COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW -- SO THE COMMITTEE HAS APPROVED SO FAR TO MONITORING LOCATIONS AND ONE IS -- IN THE PORT UP WIND DOWN ONE OF SAN DIEGO BAY BUT UP WIND OF THE PORT ACTIVITIES THEMSELVES. AND THAT'S THE TENTH AVENUE MARINE TERMINAL JONES THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND ALSO WE HAVE SHERMAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHICH IS IN THE MORE THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THAT AREA CENTRAL SOUTHERN. AND WE'RE GONNA HELP WE HAVE A FULL BLOWN MONITORING STATION THERE -- THAT WE'RE PUTTING AND WE HAD TO MOVE FROM PERKINS ELEMENTARY AND IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR LOGIN AREA BUT THAT'S A FULL BLOWN MONITORING STATION WHICH IS GOING TO COUNT TOWARD THIS BECAUSE IT IS VERY LOCALIZED. AND AGAIN -- WHAT WE'RE GONNA MEASURE AT THE TWO SITES -- PARTICULATE MATTER BLACK CARBON MEANING DIESEL EXHAUST JOHN YOU WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT ON THAT SO GRADING TOXIC BILL SEES TOXIC ORGANIC COMPOUNDS OF BLACK CARBON OR DIESEL PARTICULATES AND TOXIC METALS. IT WAS A TOXIC METALS AND THE BLACK CARBON OR DIESEL PARTICULATE THAT THE COMMITTEE OF THE RESIDENTS WANTED TO SEE SO WE INCORPORATED. FOR THAT INTO OUR PROGRAM. SO WE'RE OFF THE BAT WE'RE NOT USING OF INEXPENSIVE OTHERS WERE GOING WITH FULL BLOWN REFERENCE METHODS THAT WE THINK WILL GIVE US. REAL DATA THAT'LL HELP US DETERMINE ASCERTAIN WHAT THE SOURCES ARE OF THOSE POLLUTANTS IN THE COMMUNITY -- WE DO HAVE PURPLE -- MONITORS HAVE HEARD PEOPLE MENTION THAT WE HAVE A FEW THOSE WERE TESTING BUT WE REALLY DID WANT TO GET A REFERENCE METHOD INVOLVES WERE DOING THIS OR SPENDING THE MONEY ON THAT AND AGAIN. JUST TO EMPHASIZE THAT FOR SOME OF THE FUNDING IS OBVIOUSLY THE TO BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE TO DO THAT. WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER MONITORING SITE OUT IN EL CAJON AT LIKE SIX IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT'S OUR NATIONAL COURSE A WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE. ON EMISSIONS MONITORING INCLUDING FOR THE METAL LEAD SINCE WE HAVE GILLESPIE FIELD AND AIRCRAFT NEARBY. AND OF BLACK CARBON AS WELL. SO ON A MISSION REDUCTIONS ON ALL THE TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT DOING MORE THAN WE WERE DOING WE'RE DOING A LOT AND SORE CURRENT CURRENT COMMUNITY WAS SELECTED FOR MONITORING AS I MENTIONED. WE HAVE INCREASED STATIONARY SOURCE INSPECTIONS WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR SO FOR YEARS IN THIS AREA BECAUSE WE SEE IN NEED BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF THE COMMUNITY TO BE OTHER MORE FREQUENTLY TO ENSURE THE STATIONARY SOURCES. ARE IN FACT FULLY COMPLYING WITH THE REGULATIONS AND WE RUN A VERY AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. BUT WE DON'T AS AN ASIDE WE ALSO RUN A GRAHAM SO THAT WE CAN REALLY DO POLLUTION PREVENTION BY HELPING PEOPLE BE EDUCATED AND NOT CAUSE A PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE -- FOR INCREASED MOBILE SOURCE INSPECTIONS WE HAVE AN MO YOU WITH CARB AND WITH THE CHP ALLOWING US TO A TRUCK STOPS AND INSPECT HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND AND FOR DIESEL EMISSIONS AND THE TRANSPORT REFRIGERATION UNITS WHICH OF THE NCC UP ON THE BACK OF THE TRAILERS. AND WE'VE DONE OVER FIVE THOUSAND OF THOSE KIND OF INSPECTIONS LONG WITH OFF ROAD DIESEL POWERED EQUIPMENT IT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM JONES ONE AT ANYTHING ON THAT -- SO WHAT THE THE HEAVY DUTY INSPECTIONS OF BOB MENTIONED WOULDN'T WITH CITIES PRETTY THOSE ARE AT THE BORDER OF THE CENTRAL FREE AND PARADISE AND I FIFTEEN FOR ALSO DOING TRUCK INSPECTIONS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. WE'RE ALSO DOING IDLE INSPECTIONS WITHIN THE COMMITTEE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- DIANE MIGHT MENTION IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A REAL PROBLEM A TRUCK TRUCK DRIVING DOWN LOCAL ROADS. OF AMERICA HEALTH COALITION LONG SEE SAN DIEGO CAME UP WITH A RULE THAT NO LONGER ALLOWS TRUCKS ON CERTAIN ROADS TO ROUTE THROUGH A VERIFYING THAT THEY'RE NOT DRIVING DOWN THOSE ROADS AND PARKING AND IDOLING AND SO. WE DO A NUMBER INSPECTIONS THERE WE ALSO DO OF OFFROAD EQUIP INSPECTIONS WITHIN THE COMEDIAN OUTSIDE THE THE VEHICLES COMING INTO THE INTO THE COMMUNITY AND IMPACT RESIDENTS. AND THEN THE LAST -- DOT POINT ON THAT SLIDE OF THE FOURTEEN MOBILE SOURCE EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROJECTS -- JUST APPROVED FOR INCENTIVE FUNDING OF OVER THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT DURING THE LIFE OF THESE PROJECTS AND AND AND THE PROJECT LIFE VARIES. FIFTY TONS OF SMOG FORMING POLLUTION WILL BE ELIMINATED AND THREE POINT SEVEN TONS OF PARK FINE PARTICULATE. MATTER THAT'S IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW I HEARD OTHERS SAY ZERO EMISSIONS WE AGREE. MOBILE SOURCES ARE ARE. ABOUT 70% OF OUR PROBLEM IN THAT AREA AND YOU KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THESE PROJECTS JOHN WAS A POOR SAN DIEGO MEETING JUST LAST WEEK. AND THAT THEY'RE FINALLY STEPPING UP WE HOPE TO THE PLATE TO LOOK FOR GRANT MONEY THAT WE HAVE TO OFFER AND DO SOME PROJECTS THAT WILL REALLY HELP OUT THIS COMMUNITY. TEN KEY POINT HERE IS CONTINUED FUNDING IT'S EXPENSIVE WE CANNOT BILL OR STATIONARY SOURCES AND LESS FOR DOING SO. IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A TAXES I HEARD ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA SAY. UNLESS IT'S DIRECTLY RELATED TO THEM AND SO THE FUNDING FROM THE STATE IS KEY. YOU KNOW IT WE LIKE DOING THIS PROGRAM WE'VE LONG SCENE IN NEED FOR IT AND I'M GLAD SIX ONE SEVEN IS PASSED -- I THINK WERE ENTHUSIASTIC -- IT'S BEEN GREAT WORKING WITH THE VIRAL HOLD COALITION AND LIKE I SAID WE WANT TO BE CUTTING EDGE ON THIS AND WE WANT TO BE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT IT. AND WE ARE DOING THAT BUT I JUST I SEE IT IS NOTHING BUT POSITIVE THE FUTURE GOES ON AND I GOTTA TELL JOHN. RIGHT HERE FOR YOU GUYS HE'S DONE THESE COMMUNITY -- STEERING COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND HE'S GOT PEOPLE TALKING THAT I NEVER THOUGHT MUCH OF TALK TOGETHER BEFORE. AND IT'S BEEN VERY GOOD WE GET A LOT OF FEEDBACK AS I TOLD THOSE FOLKS AND JOHN HAS UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE. IF YOU SEE THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING SOMETHING. TELL ME WE'LL DO IT. WON'T MAKE EXCUSES WILL GET IT DONE AND THAT'S HOW WE WERE. SO WE'RE HERE FOR QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU -- PANTECH FOR IN -- I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH COALITION AND WE'RE A MEMBER OF THE SAN DIEGO PORT SIDE -- COMMUNITIES PROJECT COORDINATED BY THE SAN DIEGO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT -- I ALSO SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AS YOU MAY KNOW -- AND ITS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE THAT I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN BOTH CAPACITIES BUT TODAY I'M REPRESENTING ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH COALITION -- BUT NO MATTER WHAT ROLE AYE MAN -- I THINK THAT MY JOB IS TO IMPROVE COMMUNITIES JUST LIKE THE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BEFORE YOU TODAY. I THINK AB SIX SEVENTEEN REPRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY AND AN INTEGRATED OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT HEALTH AND CUT AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN COMMUNITIES -- BECAUSE IT'S INTEGRATED. AND HOLISTIC -- I JUST WANT TO SAY FROM THE BEGINNING AND I'LL SAY IT PROBABLY MULTIPLE TIMES IS COMMUNITY RESIDENTS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN -- ENGAGING IN CONTINUED ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHAT SOURCES OF POLLUTION ARE THE WORST AND WHICH ONES WERE GOING TO CHOOSE FROM -- THEY WANTCLEAN AIR NOW -- AND THEY WANT ACTION TO BE TAKEN SO PART OF MY GOAL TODAY IS TO SHOW YOU -- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE IN THE COMMUNITY AND WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE GOING FORWARD SO AS A BOB ILLUSTRATED THESE ARE THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON IN THE PORT SIDE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES? THESE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS AT RISK AND THIS GIVES YOU AN OVERLAY OF THE COUNT ON VIRUS SCREEN -- WITH THE PORT SIDE COMMUNITY SO WANT YOU TO SEE -- THAT THESE ARE SOME OF THE CENSUS TRACKS HERE ARE IN THE TOP 5% IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR IMPACTS SO THIS IS PART OF THE REASON THAT THEY WERE SELECTED. AND THESE ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT THESE -- COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE ONE OF THE DIESEL EMISSIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DRIVING -- DRIVING THE AIR POLLUTION AND DRIVING THE UNACCEPTABLE UNACCEPTABLE IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN CHILDREN'S ASTHMA E. R. RATES AT THREE TIMES THE RATE OF THE COUNTY WIDE AVERAGE. AND OF THE FREEWAYS IS WHAT THE FREEWAYS IN ADDITION TO THE STATIONARY SOURCES INDUSTRIAL SOURCES ARE ARE SOME OF THE CAUSES FOR THIS -- THIS MOST RECENT DATA IS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS AND THESE E. R. ASTHMA RATES ARE HIGHER THAN 92% OF THE CENSUS TRACKS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM. WITH CHILDREN'S HEALTH WE ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH LIFE EXPECTANCY AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS -- WE HAVE SOME -- LIFE EXPECTANCY THAT'S QUITE REDUCED FROM THE COUNTY AVERAGE IN THE SAME COMMUNITIES -- THESE PORT SIDE COMMUNITIES AND BURIAL LOGAN AND NATIONAL CITY IT SIX TIMES LESS THAN IT IS FOR THE COUNTY AVERAGE WARS Là HORIA -- WHICH IS A WHITE AND MORE AFFLUENT COMMUNITY AND NOT IMPACTED BY THIS POLLUTION THEY GET -- FOUR TIMES MORE -- YEARS OF FOUR TIMES MORE YEARS TWO MEN OF MY MAN OUR THE PEOPLE OF COLOR FAMILIES IN POVERTY AND LARGELY RANCHERS AND YOUNG POPULATIONS AND I THINK THESE PROFILES MATCH A LOT OF THE OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM. OUR COMMUNITIES MEMBERS HAVE CLEARLY BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT A VARIETY OF AIRBORNE SOURCES OF POLLUTION -- FROM TRUCKS AND SHIPS FROM INCOMPATIBLE LAND USES -- TO TO AND ACCIDENTS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU'VE TALKED. A LOT TODAY ABOUT INCOMPATIBLE LAND USE AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE IN MARIO LOGAN WHERE WE HAVE A PRAXAIR FACILITY -- THAT HAD HAS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF OF OF MATERIAL AS WELL AS COMPRESSED GAS -- THAT'S LOCATED RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM A HOME OF FACILITY LIKE THIS -- HAD AN EXTREME FIRE IN THE MIDWEST THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY NO HOMES THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY MILES OF EMPTY LAND -- AND WORKERS WERE INJURED BUT NO RESIDENTS WERE INJURED SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HERE IF THAT SAME KIND OF ACCIDENT WERE TO OCCUR WE ALSO HAVE BUSINESSES IN THE COMMUNITY AS JOHN MENTIONED THAT ARE ATTRACTING. HEAVY DUTY DIESEL TRUCKS THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN FROM US APARTMENT IN A SENIOR COMMUNITY COMPLEX WHERE WE HAVE AN AIR MONITORING. DEVICE -- THIS IS WHAT GOES ON THESE TRUCKS ARE COMING IN AND OUT. WE'RE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF RECYCLING FACILITIES -- THAT ARE LOCATED IN A COMMUNITY LIKE THIS ONE AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IT BLEW UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT -- AND OF THE FIRE WENT ON FOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO IS CRITICAL -- TO ALLOWING US TO REALLY HAVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS TO OTHER IT THE CARGO TERMINALS ARE RUN BY THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO AS WELL AS THE PORT BEING A LANDLORD -- TO SOME FOUR HUNDRED BUSINESSES INCLUDING LARGE FACILITIES LIKE THIS SHIP YARD -- WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE IS LOCATED RIGHT ADJACENT -- TO THE OF THE RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES -- WE ALSO HAVE THE TENTH AVENUE TERMINAL WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF EMISSIONS -- DOLE IS THE LARGEST TENANT THERE THE IMPORT ABOUT TWO BILLION BANANAS A YEAR CLOSE TO A THOUSAND TRUCK TRIPS EVERY WEEK -- AND IN NATIONAL CITY -- WE HAVE ABOUT ONE OUT OF CARS THAT THROUGH THIS TERMINAL -- RESULTING IN ABOUT A HALF A MILLION CARS A YEAR AND THOUSANDS OF TRUCK TRIPS -- EACH MONTH. SO THE ONLY PUBLIC PARK ON THE NATIONAL CITY WATERFRONT IS RIGHT HERE -- WHERE THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS GET TO SHARE THE PARK WITH THE INCOMING SHIPS WITH ALL THE? ALL THE TRUCKS NIGHT EXCUSE ME HOW THE CARS -- AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A REAL REAL YARD -- WHICH CREATES CANCER RISKS OF ABOUT FIFTY TO A HUNDRED PER MILLION AT THE LOCAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. SO WE KNOW A LOT AND I THINK THAT'S MY MAIN MESSAGE HERE -- IS THAT WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT MONITORING PROGRAMS AND WE SUPPORT THOSE AND WE'RE CONDUCTING SOME OURSELVES WE KNOW A LOT AND WE CAN BEGIN TO TAKE ACTION AND THE COMMUNITY HAS ALREADY STARTED TO DO THAT. SO OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES AS THESE TO OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE SAYING. AND WHILE COMMUNITY. ABOUT AIR POLLUTION HAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY -- IMPROVED IN OUR COMMUNITIES COMMUNITY RESIDENTS KEEP COMING UP WITH IDEAS FOR HOW THESE THINGS CAN CHANGE -- LIKE SEPARATING INDUSTRIES FROM RESIDENTIAL AND SCHOOL AREAS WHICH DOESN'T ACTUALLY REDUCE -- POLLUTION BUT IT DOES REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE OBVIOUSLY -- WE HAVE HAD -- TO HAVE A OF SUCCESSFULLY ADOPTED -- GOTTEN ADOPTION OF THE WEST SIDE SPECIFIC PLAN IN NATIONAL CITY WHICH ACTUALLY CHANGES THE ZONING. SO WHILE WE HAVEN'T HAD. MUCH SUPPORT FROM -- THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICT IN THIS REGARD BOOK THIS IS THE PURVIEW OF THE LOCAL -- CITY THEY HAVE GONE FORWARD TO TAKE THESE ACTIONS SO I GUESS GIVEN YOUR CONVERSATION I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT CITIES ARE STEPPING UP -- TO TAKE THESE ACTIONS BUT THEY NEED THE HELP OF THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AND THEY NEED HELP -- FROM CARP IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS THIS HAPPEN -- WE ACTUALLY DID UTILIZED THE LAND USE GUIDANCE THE CAR HAD -- DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO GIVE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS KIND OF LAND USE CHANGE -- SO. I THINK THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT NATIONAL CITY HAS ADOPTED AN AMORTIZATION ORDINANCE WHICH RANKED ALL OF THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY UP POLLUTION SOURCES NEAR THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND BEGAN A PHASE OUT PROCESS -- SO THAT THESE FACILITIES WOULD BE PHASED OUT AS NONCONFORMING USES. SO -- COMMUNITIES DOING A LOT THEY WANTED A SIGN IN MORRELL AND SO THAT IT WOULD SERVICE TRUCK MEDICATION -- BOOKS ARE CREATIVE AND WE DID RECENTLY GET A TRUCK ROUTE ADOPTED -- IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO SO THAT -- THEY WOULDN'T BE GOING THROUGH THE RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY WE DID CHANGE -- A HAZARDOUS WASTE YARD RIGHT NEXT TO THIS CREEK IN TO TWO HUNDRED AND ONE AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- UNITS WITH THE HELP OF THE G. G. R. F. FUNDS. BUT THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WANT CLEAN AIR AND THAT'S NOT HAPPENING AND THEY HAVE ASKED OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR IT TO HAPPEN I THINK SIX SEVENTEEN IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY. AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT I THINK THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO IS HELPING TO CREATE. OF A SYSTEM IN A FRAMEWORK FOR IT TO HAPPEN BUT FRANKLY OUR CONCERNS ARE THAT THE STAFF OF THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO IS QUITE DIFFERENT IN THE BOARD. OF THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT AND IN ORDER TO GET THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT FOLKS REALLY WANT LIKE THESE -- THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR REPEATEDLY WE'RE GONNA NEED NEW RULES WE'RE GONNA NEED -- STRONG AUTHORITY FROM I NEED HELP SOURCES BOARD IN ORDER FOR THESE SOURCES TO BE REDUCED AND EMISSION REDUCTIONS IS REALLY WHERE IT'S AT AND THEY'VE REALLY APPRECIATED THE EMPHASIS ON THAT -- IN BOTH OUR LOCAL COMMITTEE AS WELL AS HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE WE REALLY FEEL STRONGLY THAT THAT THE PORT SOURCES AND THE SHIPS AND SHIPYARDS AND THE NAVY ARE THE AS WELL AS THE ROADWAYS OBVIOUSLY -- ARE THE PLACES WHERE WE REALLY NEED THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS TO OCCUR. WE ARE -- APPRECIATIVE THAT THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO HAS SIGNALED TO THEIR STAFF THAT CLEAN AIR PLAN SHOULD BE DEVELOPED IN THAT JUST HAPPENED LAST WEEK I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT. THE SIX SEVENTEEN PUSH I THINK THAT'S A DIRECT RESULT AND WE APPRECIATE THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT BEING THERE TO SUPPORT THAT BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THAT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED. A ZERO MISSION PLANNED FOR THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO -- FOR MANY YEARS SO SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S NEW AND I'M. I'LL WRAP UP AS I CAN SEE IT HERE THE US ME TOO SO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME -- ANY MISS CHRISTINA DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WE ARE MOVING NOW TO SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO IN SCHAEFER WE HAVE SOME HERE SHE CHIC FROM SENATE FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. KEVIN HAMILTON CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AS MORE COLLABORATIVE AND CAESAR AGUILAR FROM THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NETWORK. AND AS YOU CAN TELL WE'RE RUNNING RUNNING QUITE LATE I APOLOGIZE TO THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN HANGING IN WITH US. IF YOU CAN PLEASE MAKE YOUR PRESENTATION AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT. GOOD EVENING -- MADAM CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS JUST WANTED -- TO INTRODUCE MYSELF AGAINST AMIR SHAIKH ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT THANKS AGAIN FOR NIGHT -- I WILL TRY TO COME UP WITH A RELATIVELY CONDENSED VERSION OF THE PRESENTATION RESPECT OF WHERE WE ARE -- THIS EVENING -- FIRST I JUST WANTED TO TO MENTION -- AS YOU ALL KNOW THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY -- LIGHT LIKE SOUTH COAST FACES. PERHAPS THE MOST DIFFICULT AIR QUALITY FAMILY DOES NOT ONLY THE STATE BUT IN THE COUNTRY. WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH -- THOSE OZONE AND PM TWO POINT FIVE ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS WE PUT TOGETHER. A NUMBER OF PLANS AND GENERATIONS OF RULES AND OTHER STRATEGIES TO TRY TO REDUCE. THAT ARE POLLUTION THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS OVER THE YEARS. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE AND SO AS THE ANTIWAR IN MISSION EARLIER SHE THE TERM EUNUCH UPPER SB SIX SEVENTEEN IS PROVIDING A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE THE REGIONAL WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING. PROVIDING THE COMMUNITY FOCUSED APPROACH AND NOT ONLY USING YOUR RESOURCES THAT COME OUT OF OUT OF THIS PROGRAM BUT ALSO NEW. TACTICS AND YOU STRATEGIES ACTUALLY THROUGH AB SIX SEVENTEEN AND TRY TO DO A BETTER JOB IN IN DEALING WITH THE CONCERNS THAT ARE FACING OUR VALLEY COMMUNITIES. WE'RE NO STRANGER IN TERMS OF WORKING IN OUR COMMUNITY IS AS AS WAYNE AT TA TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN VALLEY COMMUNITIES FOR A LONG TIME WE ARE THE FIRST THIS FOR TO DO THAT BY MENTAL JUST ADVISORY GROUP THAT'S AN OFFICIAL BODY. OF OUR AGENCY A LOT OF THE THE FOLKS THAT ARE THAT ARE HERE TODAY ARE ACTUALLY. GIVE A KEVIN ACTUALLY CREDIT -- FOR AT THE BEHEST OF OF HIM AND AND AND A FEW OTHERS -- ACTUALLY CREATED THAT GROUP A NUMBER OF YEARS BACK THEY'VE BEEN ADVISING US ON A NUMBER OF AREAS INCLUDING HOW WE CAN BEST. INVEST IN OUR IN OUR VALLEY COMMUNITIES IN A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS OF COME. IN OUR PURCHASE THROUGH THAT THROUGH THAT WORKS I REALLY WANTED TO TO THANK THEM. FOR THOSE YEARS OF WORK AND AND NOW HOPEFULLY LEVEL LEVERAGING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS TO DO AN EVEN BETTER JOB THROUGH AB. SIX SEVENTEEN I'M NOT GONNA FOCUS HERE ON THE REQUIREMENTS IN BRIEF YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS -- SO FAR TODAY'S INDEFINITE. JUMP REALLY QUICK INTO BEST AVAILABLE RETROFIT CONTROL TECHNOLOGY AREA THAT -- IN OUR IN OUR REGION BECAUSE OF OUR NON ATTAINMENT STATUS AND NEED TO CONTINUALLY ADOPTS. NEW PLANS FROZEN FOR PM TWO POINT FIVE AND WE'VE ALL WE'VE ALWAYS REALLY WORKED -- REALLY HARD AND KIND OF RE EVALUATING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGIES AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR RULES. ALWAYS MEET NOT ONLY BARKS BUT ALSO STANDARDS LIKE MISTER ENGINE MEASURES FOR PM TWO POINT. FIVE WE DID -- TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN TO ADOPT. THE THE STATUTORY -- A SCHEDULE THAT WAS REQUIRED AND UNDER. EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN LEVERAGED ACTUALLY THE NEW QUICK NEW PM TWO POINT FIVE PLAN ON THAT OUR OUR BOARD ADOPTED I'M LATE LAST YEAR THAT CARD WITHOUT THAT IN JANUARY JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. A LOT OF WORK WHEN TO THAT PLAN ON THESE VERY SAME CATEGORIES. OF THAT WERE SUBJECT TO THE BARK REVIEW WE LEVERAGE THAT WORK AND IF YOU CAME UP WITH A REALLY AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE -- OF RULE IMPLEMENTATION -- THROUGH THAT'S GOOD WE'RE WORKING AT LEAST FIVE TO SIX RULES PER YEAR THAT'S IN ADDITION TO A LOT OF OTHER RULE MAKING IS ACTUALLY GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR NEW. AT PM TWO POINT FIVE PLAN AND IN A RECENT OZONE PLAN THAT WAS ALSO ADOPTED. IN FLARES AS THIS ONE ONE EXAMPLE OF A OF A REGULATORY EFFORT THAT IS BEING WORK AND ACTUALLY AS WE SPEAK -- SUCH WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT -- THAT ONGOING WORK. AND YOU KNOW. THROUGH THE COMMUNITIES A SELECTION PROCESS AS YOU HEARD THERE WERE TEN THAT WERE PICKED THERE WERE TWO THAT WERE IDENTIFIED. A TWO CARDS SELECTION PROCESS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND THE CITY OF SHAFTER WHICH WAS PICKED REALLY IS A RURAL COMMUNITY IN IN THE VALLEY AND WE WE HAVE A LOT OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY A LOT OF THEM ARE RURAL AND SO. THAT WAS ONE THAT OUR BOARD RECOMMENDED TO CARBON THAT WAS PICKED BY CARBON THAT COMMUNITY SELECTION PROCESS. AND ALSO THE COMMUNITY OF SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO. AND AGAIN I SWEAR TO HIGHLIGHT THE POINT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. A LOT OF THEM. NOT ONLY THROUGH THE SO SCREEN BUT ALSO WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS THAT ARE A MAJOR PART OF THAT EVALUATION. AND THE REALLY IS NO SHORTAGE OF WORK TO BE DONE IN IN OUR REGION -- IT ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES THAT WE FACE IN KIND OF GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS IN THAT FIRST YEAR WAS A NUMBER COMMUNITIES OF REALLY WANTED. TO BE CONSIDERED IN THAT PROCESS I WANTED TO BE PRIORITIZE AND AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG AREAS OF FOCUS IN THE COMING YEARS HOW DO WE ACTUALLY GO BACK IN. AND NOT ONLY THROUGH THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN SORT OF OFFICIAL PROCESS BUT ALSO EVERYTHING ELSE WE CAN DO SUPPLEMENTAL SB SIX SIX SEVENTEEN TO REALLY TRY TO ADDRESS. THE CONCERNS THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND LEVERAGE SIX SEVENTEEN TO DO EVEN MORE WELL BEYOND WHAT WE CAN DO. IN THESE -- SEVERAL COMMUNITIES THAT WERE PICKED THROUGH THIS PROCESS. MEXICAN TO KICK THE PRESENTATION OVER -- TO JANIE HOLD SHE'S OUR DIRECTOR ABOUT RINGS THAT HAVE WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS ISN'T WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COMMUNITIES IN LAUNCHING. ON THE PROCESS WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEES AND ALL THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON HIS IN A WALK YOU THROUGH THOSE ACTIVITIES AND I'LL COME BACK IN. AND CLOSE THE PRESENTATION WITH SOME OF THE UPCOMING AREAS OF FOCUS AND WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. THANK YOU I TOO AM GOING TO BE A LITTLE QUICK IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT IN THIS PROCESS ALREADY AND I HAVE TO THANK OUR ADVOCATES BUT THE ONES HERE THAT ARE AT THE TABLE AND SOME OF THE OTHERS. FOR REALLY AT GENTLY PUSHING US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- OUR MEETINGS ARE MANAGED BY FACILITATOR AND THAT THAT'S DESIGNED TO PROVIDE OPEN AND NOT A COMPLETE COMMUNICATION WE LEARNED THAT TO HAVE THE MATERIALS IN BOTH SPANISH AND ENGLISH WE NEAR WE LEARNED THAT EVERYONE NEEDED A HAD SAT. IN WHEN SOMEONE WAS SPEAKING SPANISH THEY NEEDED TO HAVE THAT TRANSLATION GOING ON IN REAL TIME IN ENGLISH WE'RE HOLDING IN THE MEETINGS IN THE EVENING WE TOO ARE HAVING FOOD PROVIDED BY LOCAL BUSINESSES. WE HAVE CHILD CARE WITH THE ACTIVITIES WE STARTED TO HAVE OUR BIGGER -- SOUTH CENTRAL ACT COMMITTEE MEETING AT A BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS OF THE KIDS ACTUALLY HAVE SOME REALLY FUN THINGS TO DO WITH HELD FIVE PUBLIC MEETINGS IN EACH COMMUNITY THAT INCLUDED ONE KICK OFF MEETING. IN EACH COMMUNITY AND THEN FOR ACTUAL STEERING COMMITTEE MEETINGS. THE COMMUNITY OF CHAPTER SHOPPER WAS AS THE MAYOR SAID SELECTED TO REPRESENT A RURAL LAST DANCE CITY -- IT'S A RESIDENTIAL AREA NORTH OF BAKERSFIELD IT'S ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ABOUT FIFTEEN SQUARE MILES. IT CAPTURES TO IT DISADVANTAGED CENSUS RACT AND I WILL TELL YOU IT IS A MUCH DIFFERENT COMMUNITY THAN SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO THEY DO HAVE SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS BUT THEN THEY ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERNS. BUT THEY POUR IT PRIORITIZE MUCH DIFFERENTLY. THIS CHAPTER COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEE IS MADE UP OF TWENTY SIX PEOPLE THAT INCLUDES FOUR EX OFFICIO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. AND WE STARTED GATHERING -- INFORMATION SIMILAR TO OTHER STEERING COMMITTEES ON PRIORITIZING THE MAIN ISSUES THAT THE COMMUNITY THOUGHT. THAT WERE THE KEY ONES THAT NEEDED TO BE DISCUSSED NUMBER ONE IN CHAPTERS PESTICIDES AND WE'VE ALREADY INVITED AND AT OUR LAST MEETING WE HAD THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION COME OUT. AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WERE ALL WE FEEL THAT THERE'S LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES THERE TO BRING THE AGENCIES TOGETHER TO REALLY SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY. AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS AND MAKE PLANS TO PROGRESS TO ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS. TRUCK TRAFFIC OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION KERRY'S UNPAID ROSE YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE MANY -- THE THAT COMMUNITY DID APPROVE A COMMUNITY CHARTER AND A COMMUNITY BOUNDARY. AND IN THE MEETINGS HAVE GONE. RELATIVELY WELL -- I WOULD SAY THAT WE ALL ARE LEARNING A LOT THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT INCLUDES US IN THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- BUT WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ENTIRE TEAM AND EVERYONE COMING TOGETHER CHAPTER I THINK IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY POSITIVE ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS BASED ON A RECOMMENDATION OF ONE OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OF WHO SAID WE NEED A MONITOR UP NOW WE REALLY HADN'T GOTTEN FULLY INTO THE DETAILS ABOUT WHERE THE MONITOR SHOULD GO BUT WE AGREED WE NEEDED A PARTICULAR MATTER MONITOR AND IT NEEDED TO BE UP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE IN PARTICULAR MATTER SEASON. IN THE VALLEY IT ENDS IN THE SPRING SO WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD A MONITOR UP IN CHAPTER. FOR A LITTLE OVER A MONTH NOW. SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT AREA -- IT'S MORE INDUSTRIAL MORE DENSELY POPULATED IS THAT IT IS ABOUT FOURTEEN SQUARE MILES BUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THE BLUE LINE. IS THE BOUNDARY THAT CARP APPROVED THE YELLOW LINE IS THE BOUNDARY THAT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO US AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE APPLICANTS TO COME UP WITH WITH THE BOUNDARY THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE GIVEN THE LIMITED RESOURCES IN REALLY. CAN DO SERVICE TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY WHATEVER THAT COMMUNITY AND THAT BEING. HAS SEVERAL OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED CENSUS TRACTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO AT SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO COMMITTEE HAS THIRTY SIX MEMBERS PLUS SIX EXCEPT THIS YEAR -- GOVERNMENT AT MEMBERS. NEED THEIR SOME OF THE SAME THINGS BUT TRUCK EMISSIONS HIGHWAY INTERCHANGES AND LARGE INDUSTRIES TOP THE LOCK Là TOP THEIR LAST -- WE'VE HAD A CHARTER THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED -- IN FEBRUARY WE DID HAVE SOME BACK AND FORTH ON THE CHARTER AND WE REALLY AB AT THE END WENT WITH THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTION ON HOW THEY WANTED TO HANDLE VOTING WITH THAT. I'M IN THE COMMITTEE AND WITH THE CHARTER -- WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THAT BOUNDARY DISCUSSION WHICH I MENTIONED AND WE'RE LOOKING AT WHERE WE GO NEXT AS FAR AS AIR MONITORING WE ALSO FELT THAT THE SAME ISSUE WAS HAPPENING IN FRESNO SO WE HAVE AN AIR MONITOR THAT JUST OUR LAST MEETING WE ANNOUNCED. THAT ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS A HIGH SCHOOL THAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE AREA AND THAT'S UP AND RUNNING SO WE CAN GET SOME OF THAT PM DATA BEFORE THE SEASON ENDS. THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT OF A WEB TOOL THAT WE HAVE UP THIS IS FOR CHAPTER WE HAVE THEM BOTH FOR FRESNO AND FOR SHAKHTER BUT ALLOWS FOLKS TO GO IN YOU CAN CLICK ON ONE THE COLORED -- LITTLE BUBBLES IN YOU CAN GET INFORMATION WE ARE ADDING INFORMATION TO THIS RIGHT THERE YOU ONLY SEE VIOS THESE BUT OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE A VARIETY. OF OF POLLUTION INFORMATION SO FOLKS CAN ACTUALLY GO IN THEY CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THEY CAN SEE WHAT THE FACILITY YES AND THEN WE CAN MOVE FROM THERE TO MAKE SOME OF THESE DECISIONS ABOUT AIR MONITORING PLANS. EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT AND I DID WANT TO POINT THIS OUT WE'VE GOT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TOOLS THIS IS R. SHAFTER WEBSITE IT AIR MONITORING THEIR THE FOURTH KIND OF NAVIGATION TITLE OVER IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT HORIZONTALLY. THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE REAL TIME AIR MONITORING DATA FROM THE NEW CHAPTER PM MONITOR THAT WE PUT IN ABOUT A MONTH AGO THAT I MENTIONED. AND I'M GONNA TURN BACK OVER TO SMEAR SORRY I DID TRY TO BE VERY FAST LIKE THAT. WE'LL GET DOWN HERE -- SO YOU'VE HEARD THE STEAM WITHIN A COUPLE TIME TODAY YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT WAITING TO TO INVEST IN CLEAN AIR. I PROJECTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES IN AND AROUND THESE COMMUNITIES -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING -- IS REALLY SPEED ON THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. FOR THEM TO SEE THAT IF YOU CAN COME UP WITH CREATIVE STRATEGIES IF YOU HAVE A MODEL FOR HOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO SOME OF THESE THINGS WITH. WITH BUSINESSES WITH AGENCIES WITH RESIDENTS DEPENDING ON THE SCALE OF OF PROJECTS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE. IT REALLY HELPS THAT SOURCE AT THIS STAGE FOR GETTING MORE INPUT AS TO HOW MUCH MORE WE COULD DO WITH ALL THE NEW FUNDING AND RESOURCES THAT ARE COMING TO BEAR THROUGH THIS PROCESS. THIS COULD BE A KIND OF A SNAPSHOT IN THE CHAPTER AREA JUST A STORE WITH THEIR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ALONE WE'VE BEEN ABLE INVEST ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOURTEEN HUNDRED PROJECTS AND THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED TONS OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED. IN THAT AREA SO FAR JUST IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO AREA ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS NINETY TWO HUNDRED PROJECTS AND NINE THOUSAND TONS OF REDUCTIONS WE HAVE A REALLY. GOOD TRACK RECORD OF GOING INTO COMMUNITIES AND LOOKING FOR THESE PROJECTS WHETHER IT'S BUS FLEETS ARE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS OR WORKING WITH RESIDENTS ON ON TAKING GROSS POLLUTERS OFF THE ROAD. REDUCING FUEL COSTS WHAT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW CLEANING UP THOSE VEHICLES THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD EXAMPLES THAT WE CAN BUILD OFF OF IT SO THE QUESTION HERE IS WE GET THE SIX SEVENTEEN PROCESS HOW DO WE REALLY. UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT COMMUNITY AND THEN TRY TO LEAD IDEAS FOR DOING DOING EVEN THINGS YOU KNOW WITH WITH THE NEW FUNDING THAT'S COMING. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IS GONNA BE SOME REALLY OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SEE WAS STATIONARY SOURCES AS WELL WHICH ADDITIONALLY Là FUNDING IS GOING INTO MOBILE SOURCES. THERE REALLY EAGER TO TO UNDERSTAND THOSE CONCERNS AND SEE WHAT WE COULD DO WITH A COMMITTEE INPUT -- SOME OF THAT NEW FUNDING THAT HAS COME THESE LAST A BUDGET CYCLES AND THE EARLY WERE CALLED EARLY REDUCTION OR THE ACTION FUNDS. HAVE BEEN PUT TO GOOD USE AND IS VALLEY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN OVER 50% OF THEIR INITIAL EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IS ALREADY. OBLIGATED TO PROJECTS AND A 100% OF THOSE PROJECTS ACTUALLY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY A LOT OF THEM IN THESE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY SO THERE'S ALREADY A LOT OF EFFORT IN IN BRINGING ABOUT THESE REDUCTIONS THAT WERE LOOKING FOR MORE INPUT AS TO HOW. WE WOULD GO ABOUT AND WHEN WISELY SPEND THAT MONEY IN THE IN THESE COMMUNITIES. SOME ISN'T IT -- WRAP IT UP HERE WITH SOME CLOSING THOUGHTS IN SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THEM ARE ARE KIND OF UNIQUE TO WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY -- YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL -- PROVIDING ASSISTANCE -- TAKES A LOT OF RESOURCES TO SUPPORT YOU KNOW A LOT OF TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMING UP. NOW I I DO AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE RAISED EARLIER THAT THERE IS A LOT THAT WE KNOW. AND WE'RE BRINGING THOSE RESOURCES TO BEAR WE OUR EXPERTS ARE OTHER EXPERTS YOU KNOW FROM OTHER AGENCIES DEPENDING ON THE QUESTIONS INTO THE PROCESS. THERE A LOT AND YOU QUESTIONS ARE ALSO BEING RAISED THAT ARE THAT ARE THAT ARE GENERATING WHAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE SOME VERY FRUITFUL PROJECTS THAT WE WE TRY TO PRIORITIZE AND EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN PROCESS WHETHER IT'S ON THE MONITORING SIDE. OR JUST GOING IN INVESTIGATING THROUGH OTHER EXERCISES WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT ARE COMING UP -- I THINK THAT -- WORKING WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS -- MORE MOST EFFECTIVELY MORE EFFECTIVELY IT IS REALLY KEY. TO THIS PROCESS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN. CONTINUALLY IMPROVING -- WITH A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN IS THAT THERE REALLY IS A DIFFERENT. APPROACH WITH A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW WE WE IN IN THIS PROCESS YOU DON'T GO THROUGH WHAT MIGHT BE A TYPICAL IN A REGULATORY RULEMAKING PROCESS RESCHEDULE WORKSHOP GIVE A PRESENTATION. YOU KNOW HAVE A FORMAL PUBLIC COMMENTING PROCESS AT THE END. THESE ARE A LOT MORE -- INTERACTIVE MEETINGS UNDER A LOT MORE DYNAMIC AND WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE IT BE DRIVEN BY THE COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW IT SETTING THE AGENDA. ARTICULATED HAVING THESE MEETINGS OF THE COMMUNITY LET AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS A PARADIGM SHIFT I THINK IN IN THE WAY THAT SB SIX SEVENTEEN WORK SINCE A WORK CONTINUALLY TRYING. TO IMPROVE THAT PROCESS I THINK EVERY MEETING. IN SOME WAY HAS HAS ALLOWED FOR FOR EVEN BETTER INTERACTION I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE SEE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS OVER TIME. REALLY PAYING OFF YOU KNOW AND BY THE WAY. WOULD NOTHING THAT I'M SAYING HERE IS TO IS TO MINIMIZE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE GROWING PAINS. IN THIS PROCESS WE'VE LEARNED A LOT YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT THE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES. THAT IN FACT I THINK THE THE FRESNO STEERING COMMITTEE MAY BE THE LARGEST ONE IN THE STATE. JUST TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUES IN TALKING TO TO AIR BE. IT'S ABOUT FORTY PEOPLE YOU KNOW THAT ARE THE ALL HAVE YOU KNOW UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES THAT. ALL REALLY WANTED WANT WANT THEIR VOICE TO BE HEARD SO IT REALLY IS A BIG LEARNING PROCESS FOR US AND SO NOTHING THAT I THAT I FIGURES REALLY MEANT TO MINIMIZE. JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO KIND OF GET THROUGH. THOSE GROWING PAINS AND REALLY END UP SOMEWHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER TO PUT THESE PLANS TOGETHER AND BRING ABOUT THOSE REDUCTIONS. NOW ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED QUICKLY IS THAT A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE COMING UP. ARE THINGS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY EVEN FALL UNDER OTHER WE HOPE TO BE VERY BOLD IN A VERY EFFECTIVE EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT ARE COMING UP WHETHER IT SAID YOU KNOW STATE PESTICIDE. AUTHORITY ISSUE OR MOBILE SOURCE ISSUES -- YOU KNOW WE DO IN OUR IN OUR REGION HAVE AN INTER INDIRECT SOURCE REVIEW PROGRAM. THAT I THINK IS PART OF A OF A LARGER. SET OF ISSUES THAT DEAL WITH MOBILE SOURCES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW WE ACTUALLY GO ABOUT IN ADDRESSING THOSE IN A PLAN THAT WE ULTIMATELY ADOPT AND THEN -- WORK WITH CARB YOU SEE TO TAKE TO THEIR PROCESS SO THERE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN DOING THAT OUR STAFF HAVE BEEN DOING IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE BRING THE CITIES THE COUNTIES INTO THE PROCESS THAT WE BRING THE P. R.. OTHER AGENCIES INTO THE PROCESS SO THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY AT THE TABLE THEY'RE HEARING THE CONCERNS IN THEIR THINKING ABOUT WAYS. OF CONTRIBUTING TO OUR TO OUR OLD ULTIMATELY TO THE PROGRAMS THAT WE PUT TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS THAT ARE COMING UP. YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY HEAR THOSE DIRECTLY SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY RESPOND TO THEM. AND I'M GONNA A C. WRAP UP HERE WITH A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS HERE -- I THINK -- TALK ABOUT COMMUNICATION BEING IMPORTANT. JAMIE MENTIONED FACILITATED MEETINGS TO ME WE LEARNED VERY EARLY ON THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. GOOD FACILITATION WE THINK THAT THAT CONNECTS THESE FOR MAKING THE PROCESS BETTER SO WE'RE WORKING ON A SOLUTIONS FOR THAT. I THINK WE NEED TO STAINED. RESOURCES IN THE PROGRAM I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD YOU KNOW YOU TALK WITH YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT MONITORING FOR EXAMPLE. AND THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW IN IN FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FRESNO COMMUNITY. THERE ARE ACTUALLY SEVERAL DISTINCT COMMUNITIES WITHIN OUR FRESNO COMMUNITY OF CAL -- YET MALAGA YOU HAVE THE INDUSTRIAL TRIANGLE WITH DALEVILLE. POTENTIALLY SOUTHWEST FRESNO -- THERE'S ACTUALLY THIS THE ALL THE COMMUNITIES NORTH OF CAL -- EVERYONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THE SORT OF WITHIN THIS LARGER COMMUNITY AS PART OF THE PROCESS. NEED SOME KIND OF EXTENSIVE MONITORING AND SO AS WE INVEST IN DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR TOXICS FOR FOR FEDERAL REFERENCE MET THE CRITERIA MONITORING. YOU KNOW EVERYONE OF THOSE GONNA NEED SOME FORM OF A OF A TRAILER YOU KNOW COUPLED WITH THE NEED TO WRAP UP -- BUT NOT MAKE MY LEFT HERE AT LOW COST SENSORS AND THAT TAKES A LOT OF RESOURCES SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE LEARNING A LOT THROUGH THE PROCESS WE THINK THAT WE WORK TO BE DONE AND WORKING WITH A TO RECOGNIZE THEM LET MY TESTIMONY AT BE INCOMPLETE WITHOUT RECOGNITION OF THEIR SUPPORT. AND THEN OF COURSE THE THE ADVOCATES THAT ARE HERE TODAY WHO I KNOW. YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE -- I I THINK SOME POSITIVE STORIES THAT HELP PROBABLY HAVE SOME AREAS WHERE THEY WANT TO SEE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT OVER READY TO HEAR THAT AND AND WORK WITH THEM AND OTHERS. TO TO MAKE THIS IS VALUABLE PROCESS AS POSSIBLE. IT'S ONE OF THOSE WITH THAT AND WE'RE HERE AS LONG AS WE NEED TO BE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS WE GET [inaudible] YEAH. THAT'S FINE LONG AS IT MOVES YEAH YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON KEVIN HAMILTON WAS CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ASTHMA COLLABORATIVE AND AS A MEMBER ALSO OF THE STATE CONSULTATION COMMITTEE -- FOR AB SIX ONE SEVEN AND I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA ONCE AGAIN. FOR THIS AMAZING BILL AND THE AMAZING OPPORTUNITY IS PROVIDED FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. I WERE JUST BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT. SO -- AND I TALKED BRIEFLY I SORT OF AN OVERVIEW HERE AND THEN DIVE INTO FRESNO AND GET YOU KNOW THAT CITY A LITTLE BIT. MORE AND MY COLLEAGUE SAYS ARE WHO IS FROM THE SOUTH VALLEY WILL THEN -- FINISH WITH CHAPTER AND IN AND THE PRESENTATION -- A SORT OF AN OVERVIEW AS FAR AS OUR COMMUNITIES ARE COMMUNITIES REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. YOU KNOW VERY CLEARLY THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A LOT OF VISION. IT DIDN'T TAKE THEM EVEN ONE MEETING TO REALIZE THAT THE EXISTING BOUNDARIES WERE NOT ADEQUATE -- TO ENCOMPASS ALL OF THE POLLUTION THREATS THAT THEY HAD SEEN THROUGH THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES. AND AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE INVENTORIES PRESENTED BY THE AIR DISTRICT. THEY WERE VERY CONFIDENT THAT THESE RICH INVENTORY DID NOT REFLECT THEIR EXPERIENCES. ANOTHER WORDS COULDN'T SURVIVE GROUND TO WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THAT BALL FORWARD. AND IN THE FRESNO AREA YOU FIND ABOUT -- TWO THIRDS OF THAT AREA IS IN THE TOP 1% OF CALAMARI SCREENS MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES SO THESE ARE SERIOUSLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. SERIOUSLY -- DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES WHO EXPERIENCED YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM SO -- THIS IS NOT GOING TO END SOON AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIX THIS IN IN ONE YEAR HERE BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A GOOD. RUN AT IT AND WE'RE GONNA REALLY USES PROCESS TO ADDRESS THE SOURCES. AND BEGIN TO SOLVE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS AS THEY RELATE TO AIR POLLUTION WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THE ENTIRE SOLUTION DOES NOT COME FROM AIR POLLUTION AND AIR TOXICS. BUT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR -- IN THIS CHAPTER AREA THEY CAME TO THAT SAME CONSENSUS EARLY ON AND IN THAT AREA AS WELL AND WITH THE AIR DISTRICTS -- ALMOST IMMEDIATE -- AGREEMENT EXPANDED THEIR BOUNDARY LEVEL FROM THE EXISTING SQUARE TO A ROUGHLY SEVEN MILE DIAMETER CIRCLE THAT REALLY DOES BRING IN. ALL THE SOURCES THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT -- BOTH SHAFTER AND FRESNO HAVE DEMANDED THE INCLUSION OF PESTICIDES. AND DOWNING SHAFTER THEY ADDITIONALLY ARE DEALING WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS. MAINLY DAIRIES AND WHEN I SAY CONCENTRATED ANIMAL I'M TALKING ABOUT FIVE TO TWENTY THOUSAND ANIMALS. PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF JOKES ABOUT CAL FARTS YOU KNOW AND CAL BURBS. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY FUNNY UNLESS YOU'VE GOT TWENTY THOUSAND I'M SITTING NEXT YEAR HOUSE. IT'S NOT NEARLY AS HUMOR'S AT THAT POINT. SO THE INDUSTRY DONE A GOOD JOB WITH THAT BUT YOU KNOW IT IT IT IS WHAT IT IS SO -- WE HAD FOUR MEETINGS NOW FIVE TO DATE -- IN THE BEGINNING MEETING WAS AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS I JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT. THERE'S THIS TENDENCY OF THE DISTRICT TO RUN OUT HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'VE SPENT OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME. TWENTY YEARS THIRTY YEARS FORTY YEARS OF BILLION DOLLARS WHATEVER IT IS RIDICULOUS NUMBERS THAT MAKE NO SENSE. BECAUSE IF THEY DID MAKE SENSE WE HAVE CLEAN AIR. HOW CAN YOU SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY IN A PLACE TO CLEAN THE AIR NOT GET CLEAN AIR? THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME AT ALL. SO YOU HAVE TO REALLY WONDER IF WE'VE INVESTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALREADY INTO THE INDUSTRIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO HELP THEM CLEAN UP. WHY HASN'T IT HAPPENED WHY ISN'T THAT MEASURED IN ACTUAL CLEAN AIR DAYS WE SEEN? SOMEONE OF A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF DAYS WITH DIRTY AIR -- YOU COULD ARGUE THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF THAT REDUCTION IS A READ IS A RESULT OF MOBILE SOURCE REDUCTIONS. AUTOMOBILE CLEAN UPS HAVE BEEN MASSIVE BY TWO THOUSAND THAT OUR MOBILE TECHNOLOGY TO CLEAN THE TAIL PIPE. HAD GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE YOU COULD ALMOST SAY. AND TRUCKS AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND TEN TRUCK RULE WE REALLY DID START TO SEE SOME REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS THERE. BUT WE STILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INDUSTRY IN THE SOUTH VALLEY WE'VE GOT A TON OF BOILING GAS. RESERVES THAT ARE BEING PUMPED OUT OF THE GROUND AND STORED IN COMMUNITIES NEXT TO HOMES. AND UP IN THE NORTH VALLEY WE'VE GOT BUSINESSES WHERE JUST LIKE IN SOME OF THE CITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'RE SEEING REALLY -- YOU KNOW. POLLUTION. RATING BUSINESSES BEING PLACED RIGHT NEXT TO HOMES BUT MAINLY IN THE SOUTH PART FRESNO. IN THIS CONTINUES [inaudible] SO -- EARLY ON THE E. J. GROUPS REACH OUT TO THE DISTRICT I WILL SAY NOW I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE HERE. WE CAN REACH OUT TO THE DISTRICT EARLY ON AND THEY AGREED TO MEET WITH US AND PLAN THE FIRST MEETINGS. AND IN SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS WE ADDED RESIDENTS TO THAT MEETING GROUP AND WE CONTINUE TO MEET WITH THE DISTRICT. PRIOR TO MEETINGS AND AFTER MEETINGS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THERE HAVE BEEN. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE OVERALL MEETING STRUCTURE AND HOW IT ROLLS OUT. FROM THAT PROCESS -- THINGS HAVE SORT OF COME UP IS QUITE HONESTLY WHAT WE SEE A GENERAL CONCERN THAT ARE RESIDENTS OF EXPRESSED ABOUT THE CULTURAL COMPETENCY INSENSITIVITY. OF THE FACILITATOR AND SOME OF THE AIR DISTRICT STAFF -- WE GET THAT THEY MEAN WELL IN THAT NOBODY IS INTENTIONALLY INSULTING PEOPLE BUT UNINTENTIONALLY A LOT OF INSULTS OF HAPPEN PEOPLE OF FELT. IN THE DEGRADED HAVE FELT -- LIKE SOMEBODY IS IS TALKING DOWN TO THEM AND AND TALKING FROM A WHITE TOWER SAYING YOU KNOW THE IVORY TOWER COMPLEX AND AND WE KNOW THAT'S NOT INTENDED THOSE OF US WHO WORK WITH THE DISTRICT FOR MANY YEARS AND KNOW THESE PEOPLE PERSONALLY. BUT IN THIS SITUATION SITUATION IT'S JUST NOT WORKING OUT WELL SO. WE HAVE PROPOSED IN THE DISTRICT HAS EXCEPT SOME OF OUR E. J. GROUPS MIGHT LEADS AND CULTURAL SENSITIVITY TRAINING THERE HELP THEM BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO WORK IN. AND COMMUNICATE WITH OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO SEE THAT HAPPEN VERY SOON. AND THAT SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN FROM THAT SO I WANT TO PUT FRESNO IN PERSPECTIVE THIS IS THE CITY OF FRESNO -- YOU CAN SEE -- FROM THE LEGEND HERE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMUNITIES IN THE AREA THAT THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO SEE PART OF THIS ARE IN THE NINETY NINTH PERCENTILE. THESE COMMUNITIES ARE CONCENTRATED IN THIS AREA IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTED IF NOT THE MOST IMPACTED SAID OF COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE ADJACENT TO EACH OTHER IN THIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO -- THE OTHER COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING IT -- IN THE 97%. TO SO -- DRILLING DOWN INTO THE AREA OF INTEREST FRESNO BY THE WAY AS A METROPOLIS AREA WITH A POPULATION OF ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE I ALWAYS WONDER IF THE REST OF CALIFORNIA UNDERSTANDS THAT. IT'S NOT SOME LITTLE BURKE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUNCH OF COUNTLESS. K. THERE'S A MILLION PEOPLE LIVING HERE ALL RIGHT. AND SO THEY HAVE ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S THE ONLY INLAND CITY IN CALIFORNIA WITH OUT DIRECT ACCESS TO THE OCEAN. EVEN SACRAMENTO HAS A RIVER UP AND DOWN TO THE BAY. FRESNO IS THE ONLY CITY OF IT'S SIZE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THAT. SO THAT MEANS WHAT. TRUCKS RIGHT. WE PRODUCE A LOT OF STOP. SO -- WE NOT ONLY PRODUCE A LOT AG PRODUCTS BUT WE PRODUCE A LOT OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS WHICH MAY NOT BE QUITE SO WELL KNOWN. WE HAVE SOME OF THE LARGEST GLASS PLANTS IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. RIGHT NEXT TO ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES HERE. SO THIS IS THE ORIGINAL TRIANGLE THAT WAS CHOSEN. THE PURPLE AREA REFLECTS WHAT THE COMMUNITY WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THE BIG GREG AND HERE'S WHY YOU SEE THAT BIG RED DOT RIGHT THERE AT THE BOTTOM EDGE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. THAT'S A BIOMASS INCINERATOR LITTLE RED DOT BELOW IT IT'S A GIANT GLASS FACTORY. UP HERE AT THE TOP THAT'S A BIG TRUCK CENTER AND ROOFING CENTER UP THERE AT THE TOP. SO. WE WANT TO KNOW. WHO WROTE THIS BOUNDARY RIGHT THIS ISN'T A BOUNDARY THAT WE SUGGESTED IN FACT? THERE'S EVEN A CREAMERY RIGHT THERE IN THAT LITTLE TRIANGLE AT THE TOP THAT LITTLE INDENTATION IS LIKE HOW DID THAT GET LEFT OUT. WHO MADE THAT DECISION? WE DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE POINT NOW WHERE WE'RE SAYING WE CAN FIX THIS AND HERE'S HOW. SO BY THE WAY WE WENT THROUGH A VERY DELIBERATIVE PROCESS ON THIS I KNOW THIS IS KIND OF CONFUSING BUT I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND. WITH THESE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THESE RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE SOURCES. THOSE STARS ON THEIR THEY REPRESENT TOXIC EMISSIONS FROM AIR TOXICS SOURCES THE ROUND DOT TREATMENTS DO. NOT REPRESENT STATIONARY SOURCE EMISSIONS SO YOU CAN SEE RIGHT AWAY HOW MANY OF THESE EMISSIONS LIE NOT JUST ALONG THE HIGHWAY BUT OFF THE HIGHWAY IN THESE COMMUNITIES. ALONG THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE RESIDENTS RIGHTLY SO WANT TO SEE THESE SOURCES INCLUDED IN ANY WORK THAT GETS DONE. AND IN FACT EVEN THOUGH IT'S QUITE SOME. YOU SEE A LITTLE NOTATION OF DARLING INDUSTRIES WHICH IS BECOME NATIONALLY FAMOUS. FOR ITS A RENDERING PLANT. AND WRITE DOWN WIND OF IT IS A HIGH SCHOOL. AND THAT HIGH SCHOOL ON ANY GIVEN DAY IT'S GOT ABOUT. FIVE THOUSAND KIDS. AN AND THEY'LL TELL YOU IN MAY YOU CAN HARDLY STAND IT THERE. THE SMELL OF THIS PLACE AS ROTTING ANIMAL FLESH IS JUST. WAITING INTO THE AIR AND COMING DOWN ON THEIR SCHOOL WHEN THEY COME OUTSIDE FOR A BREAK. THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT THIS IS RIDICULOUS SO IN THE NEXT TO IT IS FOSTER FARMS AND I ALWAYS SAY NINE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING. GO OUT TO ANY OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS HERE DOWN WHEN TO FOSTER FARMS AND ALL YOU CAN SMELL FOR FOUR HOURS IS BAKING CHECK. SO I MEAN YOU KNOW THESE ARE SOURCES THAT ARE DIRECT THREAT TO THESE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY EXPERIENCE EVERY DAY AND HAVE BEEN. FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS OR MORE AND THEY HAVE COMPLAINED AND TRIED TO GET REDRESS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FROM PLANNING COMMISSIONS. AND FOR THE BAD LUCK OF OUR AGENCY HERE NOW COMING HERE AND SAYING LOOK. YOU KNOW WE WANT THIS CHECKED OUT WE WANT MONITORS AROUND THE SOURCES WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THIS AIR. AND IF IT'S WHAT WE THINK IT IS YOU NEED TO FIX THIS. AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM UNREASONABLE SO THE COMMUNITY HAS PROPOSED ACTUALLY THIS BOUNDARY. I I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT THE MAP THAT THEY'RE USING BUT THAT'S COOL I THINK IT'S MORE THAT 1% RIGHT THAT YOU'RE SHOWING ON YOUR MAP BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT THE COMMUNITY HAS pALL OF THESE CORNERS OUR GEO TAGGED OUR SHOP AT CCAC HAS THE TECHNICAL EXPERTS WHO CAN PRODUCE THIS DATA. AND ALL OF THE SOURCES ARE FROM THE AIR THE BASE AND OUR MOST CURRENT CELL. SO THE LAST THING I DO WANT TO MENTION IS YOU HEARD ABOUT OUR IN THE INDUSTRIAL TRIANGLE THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY A PLACE. IT'S A PLAN THE CITY OF FRESNO MADE TO SITE ALL THIS INDUSTRIAL STUFF. RIGHT IN THIS SPOT IN SOUTH FRESNO THERE'S BEEN DISENFRANCHISED FOR THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS. LOTS OF PEOPLE LIVING DOWN THERE THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY A TRIANGLE THIS IS ACTUALLY THE INDUSTRIAL COMPATIBILITY PLAN THAT THEY'RE STARTING THE PROCESS ON TO SEE CAN WE PUT ALL THAT INDUSTRY. RIGHT HERE AND NO WHERE ELSE IN OUR CITY. THERE'S NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING HERE. I MEAN SERIOUSLY. SO WE SEE FROM A LAND USE DECISION MAKING PERSPECTIVE THIS IS WHY WE SAY WE NEED MORE TEETH IN THE AIR REGULATIONS. I SEE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GREEN THE PURPLE OR BOTH ALL OF IT THE GREEN THE PURPLE AND THE YELLOW AT THE BOTTOM IS OUTSIDE THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE BUT THEY STILL. WOULD LIKE TO EITHER IN EXETER GET COOPERATION FROM THE COUNTY IT'S NOT THE GREAT. RIGHT NOW IT IS THE GREEN IS THE EXISTING INDUSTRIAL AREA. THE PURPLE IS WHAT THEY INTEND TO EXPAND. TO SO ANYWAY -- I WANT TO PASS THIS ON NOW -- TO MY COLLEAGUES I JUST WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE FRESNO POSITION HERE. CARB APPROVED BOND SO ARGUMENTS WE'VE HEARD BACK FROM THE AIR DISTRICT SO WE JUST WANNA. RAISE THOSE TO MAKE SURE WE GET HIM UP ON THE TABLE AND TALK ABOUT HIM. THE CARD APPROVED BOUNDARY CANNOT BE MODIFIED TO THIS LEVEL AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE ABOUT RESOURCES AND EXPAND YOU KNOW AND STRETCHING THOSE THEN -- I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE RECONSIDERING THE THE COMMUNITY BOUNDARIES WE SAID AS HOME TO THE MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDEN NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE ENTIRE STATE. THE AREA'S TWO BIG. WELL COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER SELECTED COMMITTEES IT'S IT'S NOT THE LARGEST EVEN WITH THE NEW GROUP. WITH THE NEW EXPANSION -- THERE'S A TYPE TIELINE WE NEED TO KEEP GOING. WE AGREE YOU KNOW WE WANT TO KEEP THIS THING GOING. WERE WILLING TO HELP BRING MORE PEOPLE UP TO SPEED AND MEET MORE OFTEN TO MEET THESE DEADLINES. AND THERE'S BEEN THIS SORT OF MET THAT SOUTHWEST IS ITS OWN COMMUNITY. WELL IN THE TCC IT WAS BUT YOU KNOW THAT COMMUNITY IS ADJACENT ALL THESE OTHER COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCING THESE EMISSIONS -- IT'S YOU CAN'T FIND A DIVIDING LINE WHERE YOU COULD SAY I KNOW I'M HERE AND I KNOW I'M NOW HERE TWENTY SAY THEY'RE NOW IT YOU YOU ARE NOW A THIRTEEN MINUTE I AM SO SORRY HAVE DOGS AND BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU -- SO AND FRESNO WILL NOT LIKELY BE SELECTED IN THE SECOND ROUND SO WE NEED TO GET IT IN NOW SIR. I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY. TAKEN UP -- MY NAME SAID HANNAH HERE TODAY I A WORKING KERN WITH US INTO CALIFORNIA BY MENTAL JUSTICE NETWORK. AND I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF WITH A QUOTE FROM AN OF A MARKETS WHICH IS ONE OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT LIVES IN CHAPTER AFTER THE FIRST MEETING THAT WE HAD -- THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU WENT TO CHECK IN A CAR TO COME AND WAIT. FOR PEOPLE TO TELL ME WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN MY COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS A SENTIMENT THAT HAS. BECOME BETTER WITH TIME I KNOW BETTER NOW FEELS MORE HOPE WITH THIS PROCESS AND THIS HAS BECOME THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE PARADIGM SHIFT. THAT SAMIR WAS TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE NOT NOTHING IS PERFECT BUT THERE IS WORK ON BOTH SIDES AS FAR AS ON THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE DISTRICTS WHICH I'D LIKE TO EXTEND A THANK YOU TO FOR YOU KNOW RESPECTING AND LISTENING TO THESE RESIDENTS. AND NOT SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW THEY'RE BETTER THAN YOU DO SO THAT IS THE WORD JOB THEY'RE LISTENING TO THE TO THE RESIDENTS AND THEIR TAKING THEIR INTERESTS INTO ACCOUNT AND PRODUCING. THINGS THAT WE CAN SEE. TO SHOW US THAT THEY ARE LISTENING TO THE RESIDENTS SO THIS IS CHAPTER RIGHT. THE PROPOSED BOUNDARY IS WITHIN THE GREEN LINE. THIS MAP WAS MADE LARGE AND GIVEN TO THE COMMUNITY DURING ONE OF THE COMMITTEE STEERING MEETINGS. THE COMMITTEE WAS ASKED TO PLACE MARKERS WHERE THE POLLUTION SOURCES WERE AND OF COURSE WITHIN THE WINDOW OF THE GREEN AREA. THEY SAID WALL. THE ROOFING PLAN IS HERE AND ALL OF THE OIL IS DOWN HERE AND THAT THERE IS ARE THIS WAY WE CAN PUT HIM ON THE MAP. WE NEED TO EXTEND THE BOUNDARIES AND WHAT CAME OF A CONSENSUS IN VOTING PROCESS OF THE COMMITTEE WITH THIS EXTENDED SEVEN MILE BOUNDARY WHICH AS YOU SEE THE GREAT TABS ON THE OUTSIDE REPRESENT EMISSIONS THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY. WITHIN THE EMISSIONS INVENTORY IN CHAPTER. THIS IS A IS A GALLON VIRAL SCREEN MAP THAT SHOWS THE HIGH LEVEL OF PESTICIDE USE FALLS WITHIN THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE. WITHIN THE CITY OF SHAFTER THE PROPOSED. TONNAGE OF THE PESTICIDE IS AROUND TWO THOUSAND IN THE CENSUS TRACKS. TO THE WEST AND TO THE EAST WHEN SHOWS TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX OTHER ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POUNDS PER SQUARE MILE OF PESTICIDES APPLIED. WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON WHY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE VERY INTERESTED IN EXTENDING THIS BOUNDARY. THIS IS THE MAP GIVEN TO US BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT SHOWS A LEGEND AS WELL -- THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS NEAR CHAPTER AND AS WELL THEY FALL OUTSIDE OF THE JURISDICTIONAL AREA -- BUT WITH THIS INCREASE THE SEVEN MILE RADIUS. SEVEN OF THESE TEN DAIRIES WILL FALL IN THE NEW JURISDICTIONAL INVENTORY AND ONLY THREE OF THEM FALL OUTSIDE WITH THE FOR THIS ONE BEING ON THE EIGHT AND A HALF MILES FROM CHAPTER ALL TEN OF THEM BEING WITHIN FIVE MILES OF ME BEFORE WHICH IS -- THIS ONE OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT HAVE HOLDS THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF KIDS IN THE DISTRICT. SO THIS MAP NOT CORRUPTED BUT THIS IS KIND OF MY ROUTINE INDICATOR MAP OF JENNER GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE I WILL GO THIS WAY REAL QUICK. SO IF YOU SEE RIGHT HERE THESE ARE ALL OF THE HAZARDOUS WASTE AREAS. AND THESE ARE HERE AS WELL THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL BOUNDARIES BUT BECAUSE OF THE EXTENDED SEVEN MILE BOUNDARIES NOW THESE HAZARDOUS AREAS WILL FALL AND TO THE AREA. THIS IS A TOXIC RELEASE FACILITY GREEN INDICATOR MAP AS WELL IT SHOWS THAT THE AB AGROCHEMICAL. PLANT IS OUTSIDE AND THE GAP ROOFING COMPANY IS OUTSIDE. WHICH THEY ARE VERY GRATEFUL. FOR THE THIS INDICATOR MAP IS OF THE PM TWO POINT FIVE WHICH SHOWS THAT. CHAPTER FALLS WITHIN THE HUNDRED PERCENTILE OF PM TWO POINT FIVE ADDITIONALLY THERE IN EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE FOR CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS -- I THINK THE EIGHTY SIX PERCENTILE FOR THE OVERALL POLLUTION BURDENS NINETY ONE PERCENTILE FOR OZONE AND THE SEVENTY SIXTH PERCENTILE FOR ASTHMA HAVING 6% ABOVE THE USUAL AMOUNT OF KIDS PER CAPITA. MEANING THEY HAVE A HIGHER POPULATION OF KIDS THAN THE USUAL CENSUS TRACT. WHICH WE KNOW KIDS A DEVELOPING KIDS ARE HIGHLY AFFECTED BY THESE PM TWO POINT FIVE AND OTHER ISSUES. AS A RESULT OF THIS THIS WITH THE PREVIOUS INVENTORY AND THIS IS THE NEW SEVEN MILE INVENTORY WHICH OBVIOUSLY SHOWS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE. INVENTORY AND THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT THE RESIDENTS AS EXPRESSED BY RESIDENTS IS MORE EFFECTIVELY DEMONSTRATED WITH THIS AREA OBVIOUSLY THIS THE HAS IT THIS IS A MUST HAVE YOU SEEN MY SHAKY HANDS RIGHT HERE. THESE ARE THEIR YOUTH THERE IS NO INFORMATION ON KNOCKS VOCS YOUR TEAM TO POINT FIVE ON DAIRIES. FOR TENANTS PER YEAR WHICH WE WOULD LIKE AND THE ONLY REASON WE HAVEN'T REACHED THIS IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IT IN MEETINGS. AND I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WHEN WE DO BRING THIS UP IN MEETINGS IT WIL GET ADDRESS. AS PER THE PARADIGM SHIFT THAT SOME YOUR TALK ABOUT. SELECT ALL THE SAME. THESE ARE SOME POSITIONS THAT. CAUSED I WOULD SAY TENSION BUT NOT FRICTION WITHIN THE STEERING COMMITTEE. THE FIRST BEING WHY THE BOUNDARY SHOULD BE EXPOUNDED WHICH I THOROUGHLY EXPLAINED WITH THE WITH THE PREVIOUS SLIDES THE SECOND BEING VOTING AND CONSENSUS NEEDED REFORM. IN THE EARLY MEETINGS -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE -- THE FACILITATOR TO THE COMMITTEE IN CHAPTER WAS A MEMBER OF THE AIR DISTRICT AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ABOUT THAT -- THEIR VOTE WAS BEING WASHED OUT BY OTHER PEOPLE THAT WERE PREVIOUS OR CURRENT -- POLITICAL ADMINISTRATORS WITHIN THE CITY OF SHAFTER AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE SPECIAL INTERESTS WITHIN THE COMMITTEE -- THERE WAS NO CLEAR WAY TO REACH CONSENSUS OR OF VOTING -- SYSTEM WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED AFTER A CONCERN WAS MADE. AND AS A TESTIMONY TO THE PREVIOUS. MEETING -- WIN CONSENSUS WITH ASKED FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON WAS TOUCHED ON AND WHEN AN OPINION WITHOUT FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE COMMITTEE MEETING -- WILL -- WAS GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR OPPORTUNITY WHICH PREVIOUSLY -- THEY DID NOT FEEL WAS THE WAS THE CASE THE THIRTEEN THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST -- THIS IS -- PERTAINING TO WERE ON THAT COMMITTEE NAMED AT THAT BALLOT GONZALEZ SHE IS A MEMBER OF A ASTRO TURF A NONPROFIT CALLED. LATINO LEADERS WHICH IS A CHILD OF A ENERGY CONGLOMERATE CALLED THE KERN CITIZENS FOR ENERGY WHICH HAS I BELIEVE NINE PETROLEUM ENERGY COMPANIES AS PART OF THEIR BOARD ONE BEING THAT C. R. C. WHICH IS CALIFORNIA RESOURCE CORPORATION AND I HAVE TO ASK YOU. TO TO START WRAPPING IT UP AND THERE'S NO INVENTORY FOR THEIRS AND WE'RE SURE THAT IF SOMEONE'S ON THE COMMITTEE THAT THEY WILL BE MAKING SURE THAT THEIR EMISSIONS ARE NOT -- TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. AND THE FOURTH ONE WHICH HAS IMPROVED IS DISTURBING MEETING MATERIALS IN A TIMELY MANNER. WHICH IS WHICH THE MERE TOUCHED ON I'D LIKE TO AND BY -- AS YOU KNOW US PUTTING TWO THINGS ONE WAS VERONICA ET SAID SHE SAID -- COURSE ADJUSTMENTS TO HELP THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S DO THEIR JOB BETTER SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SHAFTER RIGHT NOW AS I SAID IT'S NOT PERFECT IT'S GETTING BETTER AND WE WE WILL EVER FIND THIS PROCESS SO THAT BY YEAR TO THIS WILL BE A MUCH SMOOTHER PROCESS THEY GET THINGS DONE. MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND AS TO YOUR POINT YOU SAID WE NEED CREATIVITY THE RESIDENTS ARE BRING IN THIS TYPE OF CREATIVITY TO THE TABLE AYE AYES WITH MENTIONED BY THE CENTRAL VALLEY REPRESENTATIVE HE SAID THAT HE WANTS INCENTIVES TO BE MADE -- AND RESIDENTS DON'T WANT TO SEE MORE TRACTORS ONE THING THAT WAS BROUGHT UP WITH MAYBE INSTEAD OF OPEN BURNS WEEK THAT SHIP THEM. INCENTIVIZE THEM FOR CHIPPING AND THE CENTER BY THEM FOR BURNING INSTEAD OF JUST GIVING THEM SOMETHING WITHOUT AN ACCOUNTABILITY FOR DOING A BETTER A FOR EXAMPLE HERE'S THE TRACTOR FOR LESS -- EMISSIONS BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING IT AND YOU KNOW THE CREATIVITY THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE PRESENTING IS IS GONNA HELP. MAKE THINGS YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN IN A IN A WAY THAT WE NEVER EXPECTED BEFORE THEY DON'T HAVE THE BLINDERS OF BUREAUCRACY TO STOP THEM RIGHT THEY JUST SAYING WELL WHY DON'T WE DO THIS THIS SEEMS LIKE COMMON SENSE. AND OBVIOUSLY BY WORKING WITH THE DISTRICT IT WOULD HELP THEIR IDEAS COMING TO FRUITION THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THIS GARCIA ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THIS BILL. I HAD A QUESTION OF ARE COMMON ABOUT THE BOUNDARIES THAT RESET AND EIGHTEEN THE INTENTIONAL IS THAT WE DO LEARN AND WE GROW WITH THIS PROCESS SO IS IS. THERE A DISTRICT LOOKING TO ADOPT. THE SEVEN MILE OVER A FIVE MILE AND I FORGET THE NUMBER I'M SORRY IT'S LATE BUT THEN YOU EIGHTY IF I RESPOND TO THAT WHAT I UNDERSTAND TO BE THE QUESTION THERE AT THE SEVEN MILES ARE IN PLACE FOR SHAFTER IN FRESNO -- THE THERE IS A VERY OPEN MIND. TO CHANGING THE BOUNDARY I I THINK THE THE MAIN ISSUE THERE IS REALLY GOING TO COME DOWN TO UNDER AS YOU KNOW UNDER THE STATUTE THE COMMUNITY SELECTION PROCESS. IS WITH CARD SO THEY THEY SELECTED THE COMMUNITY SO. RIGHT NOW THIS VERY ACTIVE CONVERSATION GOING ON WITH RICHARD CORY WE HAD A STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING -- JUST WITHIN THE LAST WEEK OR SO WHERE. WE GOT SOME STRONG SORT OF FROM THE COMMITTEE ON SORT OF WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE. THE ONLY THING THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT IS BETWEEN CARBS SELECTION PROCESS LAST YEAR AND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE IN PLACE. HOW DRASTIC OF A OF A CHANGE YOU TOO CAN YOU MAKE THAT BOUNDARY WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THE BLUEPRINTS IN THE PROCESS ENVISIONED OR? TO SEVENTEEN ADJUSTMENTS I THINK AND YOU KNOW TO TO MAKE SURE WE CAPTURE ALL THE RIGHT SORT I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY PROCESS FOR DOING THAT. IF YOU GOAL FOR WHOLE SCALE CHANGE ANY KIND OF SHIFT OFF INTO HUGE LIKE RIGHT NOW. AB LIKE TO SEE THIS THIS MAP THAT KEVIN MENTIONED TO LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU KNOW I THINK WE'VE SEEN IT'S BEEN INVOLVING I THINK OVER TIME. IT WAS OF A THREE FOLD INCREASE ACTUALLY IN THE IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA -- BASED ON THAT THE FIRST SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE SAW I THINK IT AS WERE ABLE TO KIND OF WORK TO WORDS OKAY WHAT ARE THOSE CONCERNS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET. TO AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE'RE STILL CONSISTENT WITH YOU KNOW WITH THE THE THE STATE ROLE ACTUALLY GONNA SELECTING THE COMMUNITY TO THAT PROCESS. I THINK WE CAN GET THERE SO. WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON THAT VERY ACTIVELY IT SHOULD BE YOU KNOW WITHIN WITHIN A WEEK AND THE DEADLINE THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED. TO HAVE A FINAL BOUNDARY SET UP THAT I'M HOPING WE CAN REPORT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW SORT OF SUPPORTS ALL OF THEIR CONCERNS THAT CAME UP IN THE IN THAT DISCUSSION. SO WHAT THE NO WE BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS WITH AIR THE AND ALSO IT YOU KNOW IT WITH WITH DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN. CONTINUALLY GIVEN SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO TAKE THAT DIRECTION ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING WITH A THAT MEETS THOSE CONSERVATIVE COME UP SO. A AND I APPRECIATE THAT THERE BE STILL HERE ON AND TAKING NOTE OF OF THAT AND HOW. EVEN FROM THE COMMUNITY OR TO SEE THOSE BOUNDARIES LEARNING FROM THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. AND THEN OUR LAST PANEL -- IS -- MARK LYTTON HEISER FROM SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. AND BILL KNOWLTON MACRO PARTNERSHIP WITH PATRICIA SHALL BE NORTH OF GOING TO A CREEK NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION. I JUST TO CLARIFY THAT THAT -- MISTER KNOWLTON AND MICHELLE BE WILL HAVE EIGHT MINUTES COMBINED NOT A GOOD THING YEAH. WE DOWN AT THE LAST WE HAVE A GOAL. THE BEST FOR LAST THANK YOU AND WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC. YEAH I MEAN WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL AT THE END [inaudible] SHARE OKAY WELL I GUESS AT THIS POINT IT IS GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS MARK ROUTES AND HIGHS ARE REPRESENTS SECULAR QUITE MANAGEMENT DISTRICT HERE THIS EVENING. ON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER NEVERS PROSSER DR ALBERT TIE ALL OF POLITICS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE HERE IN PERSON HE SURE IT'S GOT AROUND HIS AVAILABILITY. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M GONNA SORT OF SKIP SOME PARTS OF THIS AND SO I'M GONNA. APOLOGIZE TO ANY OF THE ELECTED SOONER THAN THAT WE WERE GOING TO THANK REPRESENTS CHECK OUR REGION COULD OUR LOCAL ELECTED SOME JUST GIVE A BROUGHT SHOUT OUT TO ALL OF THEIR SUPPORT IN THIS PROCESS -- TO THAT EXTENT I MAKE SO. I MISTER JUMP RIGHT AHEAD THEN IN TO SHARE WITH YOU VERY QUICKLY WILL THAT WHAT WE DID IN TERMS OF OUR ORIGINAL NOMINATIONS OF MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES AND FOCUS IN ON THE COMMITTEE THAT WAS SELECTED IN YOUR ONE SO. WE'RE GONNA TALK VERY QUICKLY ABOUT OUR ANALYSIS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF OUR ORIGINAL TEND COMMUNITIES -- THAT WE HAD THOUGHT WERE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. WE'LL DISCUSS IN THE UNIQUE ASPECTS ARE COMMUNITIES AND HOW THESE ASPECTS TRANSCEND BOTH CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. AND BY THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT WE SEE MOVING FORWARD SIX SEVENTEEN IN THE OPTION IS GOING INTO THE FUTURE YEARS. SO JUST FAIRLY QUICKLY HERE ONE OF THINGS WE DID IN TERMS OF JUST IDENTIFY COMMUNITIES AS A WHOLE IN SACRAMENTO'S WE TRIED TO GO WITH SOMETHING FAIRLY QUANTITATIVE MEANING WE LOOKED AT EVERYTHING FROM. THE CALLIN BUYERS SCREEN -- WE TOOK A LOOK AT JUST THOSE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS WE LOOKED AT THE HEALTH RISK NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHICH IS A HOSPITAL BASED INFORMATION THAT THE LOCAL HOSPITAL REQUIRED PUT TOGETHER INVOLVED EVERYTHING FROM ASTHMA. EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS WE TOOK A LOOK AT ECONOMICS WE TOOK A LOOK AT POVERTY ISSUES WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT WHERE ARE THEIR PARKS WHERE THEIR SCHOOLS WHERE IS THE LOCATION OF OUR NEARBY BUSINESSES INCLUDING OUR TOXIC HOT SPOTS FOR THE TWENTY FIVE IDIOT SOURCES. DOING ALL THOSE THINGS WE BASICALLY SIGNED JUST A SCREENING NUMBER TO THEM AND FROM THAT THEN WE RANKED OUT TEN BROAD COMMUNITIES. THE REASON I KNOW THIS RECAP EARLIER IN SOME THE OTHER PRESENTATIONS THAT YOU SEE SIR SOME ODD BOUNDARIES AS A WHOLE IS A LOT INFORMATION CENSUS TRACT BASED. AND CENSUS TRACTS THEMSELVES HAVE VERY ODD ANGLES. BANDS NOOKS CRANNIES XTERRA. SO THEN WE TOOK HIM WE ADDED A HALF MILE BUFFER -- TO THE CENSUS TRACKS THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SOME OF THESE. CURVING AREAS. SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT -- THIS ROBUST APPROACH MORE QUICKLY CAPTURES EXPOSURE TO POLLUTION AND THE IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO WITH THAT THOUGH THEN WILL FOCUS IN ON THE SOUTH SECOND FLOOR AND COMMUNITY WHICH WAS ACTUALLY SELECTED IN YEAR. ONE AND YOU'LL SEE THAT ONCE OF A NICE LITTLE CLEAN BOUNDARIES ARE CLEANER BOUNDARIES AT THE MOMENT ON THIS MAP AND WHERE THAT COMES FROM. IS THIS SENSE OF IT HARD TO SEE ON THIS. YOU WILL SEE A DASHED LINE INSIDE OF THE OVERALL BOX. THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL COMMITTEE BOUNDARIES TO THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD BACK IN THE FALL. AND THE FINAL BOUNDARIES ARE WHAT CAME OUT OF THE COMMUNITY PROCESS OF THEM TAKING A LOOK AT THAT THEM LOOKING AT SAYING -- WHERE DID YOU COME UP WHY YOU HAVE THIS NICK HERE WHAT IS TO COME UP WITH AND SO THERE FEEDBACK ON BOTH? BUSINESSES THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT JUST WHERE THEY WANTED TO TRY IT SO KEEP THE COMMUNITY SOMEWHAT DEFINED. IN TERMS OF JUST MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS A COMMUNITY FOCUS. HAS ALWAYS WE GO BACK TO PREVIOUS MAP WE HAVE A NUMBER OF AREAS TROUT SECTOR THEY'RE ALL VERY IMPACT IN CONCERN. OF RHETORIC INTO A COMMUNITY SCALE MONITORING. THE THOUGHT PROCESS FROM THE DISTRICT BUT I AND SUPPORTED BY THE STEERING COMMITTEE WAS. LET'S TRY TO KEEP IT DOWN HERE INTO THIS COMMUNITY WE CAN FIND OUT ATTY COMMUNITY. NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL BASIS. ANSWER THE SOUTH SECOND FORM WAS ONE OF OUR TOP RATE COMMUNITIES DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS. NOW WE DO HAVE THE CENSUS TRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS DISSIDENTS COMMUNITIES THEY ARE THAT TOP TWO PERCENTILE OF THE COUNT BUYERS SCREEN. IT IS RIGHT NEXT TO IN SURROUNDING THE HIGHWAY. NINETY NINE A LOT OF TRAFFIC COMING IN AND JUST A BIT FURTHER WEST THE FIVE OZ THEY ARE AN AREA THAT IS CRISSCROSSED BY MAJOR THOROUGHFARES INCLUDING TRUCKING ROUTES THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THEIR COMMUNITY AREA. AND SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT CAUSES -- TO RISE TO THE TOP AREAS. I ALREADY MENTIONED THE STRENGTH IS ACTUALLY ONE IN SELECTING THE FINAL BOUNDARIES ON THE COMMUNITY. AND JUST TOUCH REAL QUICKLY UPON -- STRUCK ME ITSELF IT IS COMPRISED OF MOSTLY RESIDENTS ALTHOUGH WE DO HAVE REPRESENTATION FROM THE BUSINESS BOTH -- BROAD REPRESENTATION AND SMALL WE HAVE SOME COMMITTEE GROUPS ARE REPRESENTED ON AS WELL ALONG WITH A HEALTH OFFICIAL AND ONE MEMBER REPRESENTING OUR LOCAL ELECTED FOR THE AREA -- THE SELECTION PROCESS JUST THAT -- HAS READ THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT OCCURRED TO HOW WE SELECTED OUR STEERING COMMITTEE WAS WE SORTED IT WERE WE DID IT IN A TWO STEP PROCESS. THE DISTRICTS SCREENED ONLY TO ENSURE THAT INTEREST THE CANNONS LIVED OR WORKED IN OR IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE SELECTED COMMUNITY THE REASON I SAY CHASTENED TO IT IS WE KNEW THAT THE BOUNDARY LIKELY WOULD BE CHANGING A LITTLE BIT. AND ULTIMATELY THE ALL THE BRIDGE. THAT MEMBERS ARE WITHIN THE FINAL BOUNDARY. THE SECOND STEP OF THE PROCESS WAS THEN THE DISTRICTS SIMPLY RECOMMENDED INCLUSION OF ALL MEMBERS ARE ALL APPLICANTS WHO MET THOSE CRITERIA OF LIVING OR WORKING IN THE COMMUNITY. TO A SELECTION BODY IF YOU WILL IN THAT BODY INCLUDED BOTH OUR LOCAL ACT IT'S INCLUDED THE E. J. OFFICE OF CARP. AND INCLUDED OTHER NGO GROUPS THROUGHOUT SACRAMENTO INCLUDING AREAS SUCH AS BREEDS. AN ORGANIZED SACRAMENTO JUST TO NAME A COUPLE OF THE L. ORGANIZATIONS ARE INVOLVED. OUR COMMUNICATION PROCESSES COMMANDER WAY AND STERN COMMITTEE HAS COME IN SEVERAL TIMES SINCE DECEMBER AS MEETING AGAIN BOTH TOMORROW AND NEXT WEEK. WE REALIZE HOW WAIT WE'RE GOING TONIGHT WITH MY POSTPONED THAT ONE FOR TOMORROW -- JUST SOME KEY CONCERNS THAT PIPE IN HIGH BY THE COMMITTEE INCLUDE EMISSIONS FROM THE FREEWAYS AND ROADWAYS. IMPACTS FROM THESE MISSIONS ON SENSE RECEPTORS SUCH AS CHILDREN WALKING TO SCHOOL AND LIVING NEAR THE ROADWAYS. SO REAL QUICKLY JUST WALL. WE HAVE BEEN UNDER VERY AGGRESSIVE TIME LINES WITH GUYS MISTER COMMITTEE WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET THE STATE'S DEADLINE TO INITIATE CARE MONITORING BY JULY. ONE I QUIT WILL LIKELY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF MOBILE LAB EQUIPPED WITH A COLLECTION OF VARIOUS WITH THE FOR THE COLLECTION OF VARIOUS GASES AND CAN'T POLLUTION SAMPLES OF THIS WOULD BE REGULATORY GREAT MONITORING. IN COMBINATION WITH. A NETWORK WANDERING IN THE COMMUNITY. WHILE LOW COST SENSORS COME WITH LIMITATIONS WE BELIEVE THEY ARE GOOD SCREENING TOOL AND CAN LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF LOCALIZED ENTRANCE IN IMPACTS THAT EXISTING AIR MODERN NETWORKS CANNOT CAPTURE. HENCE THE BENEFIT OF SIX SEVENTEEN IN PARALLEL WE'RE ALSO WORKING VERY EFFECTIVELY WE THINK THERE STERN COMMITTEE AT SUGGEST BY CARD DURING THIS TIME A BOARD MEETING WHEN THE TEN COMMUNITY STATE WIDE WERE SELECTED. WHETHER COMMUNITIES FORMALLY IDENTIFIED FOR AIR MONITORING ONLY SHOULD NOT DETRACT FROM THE IMPORTANCE EMISSION REDUCTION PLANS FOR TAKING PROMPT ACTION TO IDENTIFY SOURCE OF POLLUTION IMPACTS. ANY OPTIONS TO MITIGATE THEM. IN THIS REGARD WE APPEAL TO THIS COMMITTEE AND YOUR FELLOW LEGISLATORS TO MAKE A BILL CAP AND TRADE FINE PRINCESS REMISSION REDUCTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FOR EXPECT MUCH OF THE FOCUS WILL RIGHT PLEASE. BE ON AND SENSIBLE SOURCE REDUCTIONS WE APPLAUD THE LEGISLATORS LET'S SESSIONS WITH HIM TO LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN POTENTIAL NEW OPPORTUNITY REDUCTIONS THAT STATIONARY SOURCES. AB SIX SEVENTEEN TO BEGIN A NEW CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF BACK TO PUSH CONTROLS OR INCENTIVES -- BY LAUNCHING THE RIGHT SOLUTIONS FOR SENSOR RECEPTORS LIKE SCHOOLS AND EDUCTION BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED FROM LOCAL SOURCES. ON OUR SIDE THE DISTRICT IS REVIEWING A RULES AND UPDATING FESTIVAL RETROFIT CONTROL TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CARP ON NEW AN EXPECTED REGULAR REQUIREMENTS FOR MISSIONS REPORTING AND REMAIN HOPEFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL IDENTIFY THE NESTOR RESOURCES WE NEED TO EMPLOY. IMPLEMENT THIS NEW STATE MANDATE. THE LAST POINT I WOULD LIKE TO COVER WROTE BEFORE I TURN ORDER STERN COMMITTEE REPRESENTATIVES IS WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. THE DISTRICT APPRECIATES RESOURCES ALLOCATE IN THE FIRST YEAR THE PROGRAM FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND INCENTIVES ONE KEY TAKE WAY FOR EXPERIENCES THAT EVEN GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED RESOURCES. SOURCE NEEDS OF AN ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FIRST COMMUNITIES. INVOLVED WITH OUR COMMUNITY STERN COMMITTEE HAS BEEN VERY POSITIVE IT ALSO BEEN FAR MORE -- RESOURCE INTENSIVE THAN WE ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. BOTH IN TIME COMMITMENTS FOR THE STRENGTHENING THEMSELVES IN AGAIN APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT ARE STERN COMMITTEE HAS SPENT HER TODAY CAN TOMORROW NEXT WEEK. BUT ALSO THEN THE NECESSARY RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AS A DISTRICT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THEM AND TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THEY HAVE SAID THEY CAN MAKE WELL INFORMED DECISIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. MOVING FORWARD WILL CONTINUE WORK WITH CARBON INTEND TO RECOMMEND THE INCLUSION A SECOND COMMUNITY IN THE SECOND REGION FOR YOUR TO THE PROGRAM. BUT AS WE EXPANDED TO ADDITIONAL IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FROM THE STATE WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF COMMITTEE MONITORING AND REDUCTIONS OF LOCAL MISSIONS. THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ALL HAVE ACCESS POLLUTION IMPACTS ARE EXPECTING ACTION. RIGHTFULLY THE PROMISE OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN HAS RAISED EXPECTATIONS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HELP IS COMING. OUR AGENCY LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH. YOU TO ADVOCATE FOR ADEQUATE AN UNINTERRUPTED FUNDING THAT NOT ONLY CAN WE IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM THE MAINTAIN PROGRESS REDUCTION POLLUTION BURDENS AND IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. WEEKEND WANTED THANK THIS STAFF HERE AND ALL OF OUR ELECTED SPOKE STATE AND LOCAL IN TERMS THIS.

AND AND THE CHAIR OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE I FOUND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND THE AND THE STAFF -- EXEMPLARY -- WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT OUR OUR OUR REGION AND SO MUCH ABOUT REALLY THE LOCAL IMPACTS OF OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF POLLUTION. SO I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE STAFF IN IN THEIR LEADERSHIP -- WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM FROM BUSINESS PEOPLE -- TO TO RESIDENTS TO COMMUNITY ACTIVIST ACT -- REALLY PEOPLE ADVOCATING FOR THEIR NAME I WILL SAY THAT THAT THE THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WE HAVE IS IS IS IT'S A REALLY -- A COMMERCIAL DISTRICT WITH WITH A LOT OF WHAT THAT BRINGS WITH IT -- BY OFFICE SITS ON RIGHT ON STOCKTON BOULEVARD IN. NINETY NINE AND ON SUCH A BOULEVARD THERE'S THERE'S RIGHT UNDER -- EIGHT NINETY THOUSAND CARS THAT SIT THERE AN IDLE EVERYDAY. AND WHEN WE HAD ONE OF OUR MEETINGS THE THE THE DOCTOR SAID.

AT AT OUR COMMUNITY DESERVES EVERYTHING THAT EVERY OTHER COMMUNITY HOUSE. THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW LIFE LIFE EXPECTANCY SHOULD NOT BE A ZIP CODE AND AND AND WE WE HEAR THAT A LOT IT'S KIND OF A BUZZ WORD BUT IT'S A FACT. YOU KNOW WHO PEOPLE A GRANITE BAY LIVE LONGER THE PEOPLE IN AND SALSA THAT'S A THAT'S A FACT. AND SO FOR US THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP WERE WERE HAPPY TO BE HERE AND WERE -- WERE BOTH HAPPY THAT WE WE'VE WAITED ALL DAY. OF OUR CLASSES. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS PATRICIA SHELBY I AM A A LONG TERM RESIDENT OF CELL SACRAMENTO. MOTHER OF FIVE GRANDMOTHER TO AT THE NINTH ONE ON THE WAY -- I HAVE REAL CONCERNS I AM A AND ASTHMA SUFFER I HAD TO STOP MY JOB EARLY BECAUSE OF MY LUNG PROBLEMS AND MY SPECIALIST HAS RECOMMENDED THAT I MOVED. AWAY SOME PLACE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHERE AND TO TRY TO PRESERVE I NATURAL LIFE TIME FOR MYSELF. I BURIED MY MOTHER IN SEPTEMBER. I A NON SMOKER NEVER LIVED IN A HOUSEHOLD OF SMOKERS WHO DIED OF LUNG CANCER AFTER MOVING TO SACRAMENTO TO SUPPORT ME AND MY CHILDREN AND MY FAMILY FOR THIRTY YEARS. SO THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME IT IS IMPORTANT TO MY FAMILY IT'S IMPORTANT TO MY CHILDREN. ALL OF MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE ASTHMA SUFFERERS -- THAT'S AMAZING TO ME I DID NOT HAVE ASTHMA UNTIL I MOVED TO SACRAMENTO THIRTY YEARS AGO. AND STARTED TO FIVE YEARS AND STARTING TO HAVE PROBLEMS. SO -- THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS IMPORTANT TO ME I DE I A STATED AT THE VERY FIRST MEETING I'M NOT HERE TO BE WALL PAPER. I'M NOT HERE TO JUST BE A CHECK ON THE BOX ARE WE REALLY TRYING TO DO SOMETHING. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO PUSH AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED TO WE HAVE. A LOT OF CHILDREN IN THE AREA WE HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG FAMILIES. AND THEY ARE IN THE SAID DID -- ERR ERR QUALITY AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS IT AND MAKE A CHANGE FOR THE FUTURE FOR OURSELVES AND FOR OUR CHILDREN. I WANT TO LIVE A LONG TIME I WENT TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY MY CHILDREN AND MY GRANDCHILDREN AND MY GREAT GRAND CHILDREN. BUT I KNOW THAT THE AIR THAT I BREATHE AND THAT THE AIR THAT IS THERE FOR THEM. CAN IMPACT THAT. AND SO -- WE HAVE -- WORKED TOGETHER SUCCESSFULLY WE HAVETRIED OUR VERY BEST. TO LAND ON A MOVING PLANE. AND GET -- GET INFORMATION AND THE WE'VE ASKED WE DEMANDED A LOT THEY HAVE GIVEN US A LOT OF INFORMATION A LOT OF RESOURCES. SO WE COULD BRING OURSELVES UP TO SPEED. THE TIME FRAMES ARE VERY VERY STRICT AND VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO MEET. BUT WE ARE ENDEAVORING TO DO IT BECAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT. AND WE KNOW HOW MANY IS IT CAN BE FLEETING WE KNOW HOW -- HOW TENDER ARE YOUNG CHILDREN'S LUNGS ARE IN THE WE NEED TO START THIS WORK NOW TO ADDRESS IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE? SO I THINK YOU I THINK -- AND PARTNERS AND COLLEAGUES AND WORKING ON THIS -- THEY DON'T TALK DOWN -- THEY BREAK IT DOWN WHEN WE NEED TO BREAK IT DOWN. AND BILL AND I ARE ARE CHAIR AND CO CHAIR AND WE READ THE MEETING. AND WE MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK CAN BE UNDERSTOOD. AND HOW TO HELP BORROWED CELLS MANAGE BY TABLING SOME THINGS AND STAFF WILL STAY AND LINGER IN CANCER THAT PERSONAL ONE ON ONE QUESTION INSTEAD OF TAKING UP. THAT THE TABLE TIME BUT I THINK YOU SO VERY MUCH I SEE MY CLOCK IS RUNNING OUT AND I WANT TO BEAT THAT TIME SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE GOLD STAR GROUP -- BEFORE YOU BRING UP THE LAST GROUP WHICH IS PUBLIC COMMENTS I WANT TO SEE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. AND THEN LASTLY WE HAVE A THREE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK IF THEY WANT TO MAKE THEIR WAY UP. GEN WILLIAMS -- EIGHT AND SMITH AND PROBABLY TRY KNOWN IF THERE'S ANYBODY ELSE WHO WANTED TO SPEAK PLEASE COME UP. I'LL GIVE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC NO MORE I WILL CUT YOU OFF FOR SURE -- AT THAT POINT. AND IF YOU CAN SPEAK FOR LESS TIME THAT WOULD YOU'LL GET IT DOUBLE GOLD STAR [inaudible] VERNE. SO WE WILL HAVE COMMENTS AFTERWARDS FROM -- DISCUSSION MYSELF OKAY. OKAY I'M CHEN WILLIAMS I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AGAINST TOXICS -- HOWEVER I HAVE AN ALTER EGO AND THAT IS THAT YOU'RE THIS YOU'RE CLOSE NATIONAL CLEAN AIR TEAM. AND IN THE ROLE AS THE CHAIR OF THE SIR CLOSE NATIONAL CLEANER TEAM I DO A LOT OF WORK ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT. AND I JUST WANTED TO JUST BRIEFLY PUT THE ACT IN PERSPECTIVE AND THAT IS THAT. IT HAS A LIMITED NUMBER OF TOOLS TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION. IT HAS ENFORCEMENT IT HAS STANDARD SETTING AND IT HAS CHANGES IN -- BASICALLY ATTAINMENT STATUS EATING OF THIS PROGRAM WE WERE VERY CLEAR IN ASKING. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. WHATEVER MONITORING YOU'RE GONNA DO CAN YOU PLEASE DO IT WITH FEDERAL REFERENCE METHOD SO THAT WE CAN GET THE BENEFITS OF THE ACT -- BECAUSE WITHOUT THOSE BENEFITS IS VERY DIFFICULT CARVE AND THE DISTRICTS DO HAVE LIMITED TOOLS. FROM AND WE'RE VERY FRUSTRATED THEY DO NOT FOLLOW THAT ADVICE BECAUSE NOW YEARS GONE BY AND WE HAVE NOTHING THAT WE CAN USE TO USE ANY OF THE TOOLS AND THE FEDERAL ACT ACTUALLY GET EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. AND MANY OF US -- ON THE ADVOCACY COMMUNITY OF SAID THAT THIS WAS NOT EIGHT AIR POLLUTION MONITORING BILL IT IS A REDUCTION BILL. AND NOW WE SEE THE CONSTANT NEED FOR PEOPLE. BOND MOST OF THE DISTRICTS CAME UP HERE AND SAID IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE FUNDING WE NEED MORE PEOPLE. SO I WAS GOING TO HAVE A QUICK POWER POINT IT HAD A PERSON WITH A CLIPBOARD SAYS THIS IS NOT ANY MISSION REDUCTION. YOU KNOW A ELECTRIC CAR -- A HYBRID VEHICLE A YOU KNOW ONE OF ONE OF THE LIST OF MY COLLEAGUES JESSE HAS ALL THESE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. SO A NUMBER OF US SORT OF WORKED ON EFFORTS TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION IN THE STATE FOR THE LAST QUARTER OF A CENTURY. ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB SIX ONE SEVEN WE WANT TO EMBRACE THE PROMISE TO THESE HIGHLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES OF ACTUALLY GETTING CLEANER AIR. AND WE'RE NOT SURE THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT -- THERE IS JUST A STUDY THAT CAME OUT -- ACTUALLY YESTERDAY. FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION PARTICULAR MATTER. IS KILLING MORE PEOPLE GLOBALLY THEN SMOKING IS. BUT YOU CAN CHOOSE TO SMOKE YOU CAN'T CHOOSE NOT TO BREED. SO -- THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS AND AGAIN WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. COOPERATIVELY WITH THE COMMITTEE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH AGENCIES TO TRY TO MAKE THE PROMISE OF AB SIX ONE SEVEN REAL. AND APPLAUD THE ASSEMBLY AND SIMPLY MEMBER GARCIA FOR PUSHING THIS BILL FORWARD AND HOPE THAT WE CAN AGAIN WORK TO ACTUALLY GET EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M ASK YOU ONE QUESTION DO YOU THINK THAT THE REASON THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE REDUCTIONS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS A QUESTION JUST OF THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME. THAT THERE'S BEEN SINCE THE BILL WAS IMPLEMENTED OR DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING. OUR SYSTEM AYE KLAY -- THAT CAN BE DONE IN OTHER WORDS DO YOU THINK IF YOU WERE HERE A YEAR FROM NOW YOU WOULD HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. AND I GUESS. WE WILL SEE IF WE HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE BUT THE ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND ESPECIALLY ON STATIONARY SOURCES. IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE REDUCTIONS. FROM STATIONARY SOURCES IN CALIFORNIA HAD ACTUALLY OCCURRED THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL ACT. NOT THROUGH STATE LEVEL ACTIONS pLINE MONITORING IT REFINERIES THAT ACTUALLY THIS BODY PASSED TO BILL IMPLEMENTING. IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED ALREADY BY THE FEDERAL ACT AND THE DEADLINES ARE IN THE FEDERAL ACT AND WE EXPECT GREAT REDUCTIONS FROM THAT FENCE LINE MONITORING. THAT WAS A HUGE -- NUMBER -- JUST HE WAS WAS PART OF OUR COLD THE COUNTRY WORKED ON THAT DURING THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. WITH SO. THE THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE SEE UNFORTUNATELY ARE NOT MANY OF THEM ARE NOT COMING FROM ACTIONS THAT ARE FROM OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE COMING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT JUST TO SAY. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OPEN BURNING OF ADDRESSES INCREASE IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS I MEAN THERE THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN CONTROL STATIONARY SOURCES WE CAN'T GET THOSE KINDS OF REDUCTIONS IF WE'RE JUST GONNA OPEN BURN AG WASTE. SO. THANK YOU. OKAY NEXT SPEAKER -- PHOEBE SETON -- WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY I I WILL BE QUICK AND I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE GOLD STARS AND I WOULD LIKE. TO I MEAN I I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY GOLD STARS STARS I NEED TO TURN. IN GOLD STARS FOR A SNACK BUT CAN OF THIS NEGOTIATE THAT LATER. I AM IT MANY OF THE THE FOLKS WHO WHO PROVIDED TESTIMONY HIT. SO MANY OF THE KEY POINTS WE NEED TO SEE STRONGER CAN LEADERSHIP FROM CARVE CHARTER LEADERSHIP FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT CARP IS INSTITUTING STANDARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE READING WE'RE MEETING. OUR OUR EMISSIONS GOALS ACTUALLY ACHIEVING MEANINGFUL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN THE SELECTED COMMUNITIES AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- ALSO IT WAS VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE HOW MUCH TIME THAT YOU ALL DEDICATED TODAY -- TO THESE -- TO THIS HEARING AND THE THING FEEL THAT FIVE MINUTES IS A VERY VERY VERY GENEROUS AFTER SO MUCH TESTIMONY AND I THINK IT SPEAKS TO KIND OF THE THE VALUE THAT YOU ALL PLAYS ON THE LEADERSHIP FROM THE COMMUNITIES AND FROM THE REGION'S. AND AND WE'RE REALLY HERE TO ASK PLACE THAT MUCH CAN CONFIDENCE AND FAITH AND RESPECT IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PART OF THE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES -- AT CARVE IN IDENTIFYING THE AREAS IN THE COMMUNITY SELECTED AS THE THE INITIAL -- AREAS COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS FOR MISSION REDUCTION PLANS. IT WAS A DATE SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT THOSE WORK IN GENERAL AREAS AND DELEGATED TO THE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC AREAS BASED ON COMMUNITY BASED KNOWLEDGE SO WE WOULD I THINK LAKE CONTINUED CAN LEADERSHIP FROM CARVE. AND THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY TO TO REINFORCE THAT THE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEE IS FOR OUR PROVIDING LEADERSHIP AND DECISION MAKING AROUND BOUNDARIES. ARE AROUND THE EMISSION REDUCTION PLANS IT CETERA A COUPLE FOLKS OF ALL TO DISCUSS THE AREA WIDE THAT WE WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT STATIONARY. MOBILE SOURCES AND AREA WIDE LOOKING AT AT BURNING DUST AND PESTICIDES IN PARTICULAR YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT SOUNDED LIKE FROM SHAFTER LAST MEETING THAT PESTICIDES ARE GOING TO BE CONSIDERED. AND PART OF THE MEASURE ACTION PLANS DOESN'T WANT TO REINFORCE THAT WE REALLY WANT TO SEE AND FORCE OF ALL KIND OF METRICS TIED TO PESTICIDES IN THOSE AREAS IMPACTED BY PESTICIDES. SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN TO THE IMPORTANCE OF A LAND USE SO AGAIN JUST REINFORCING THAT WE WILL NOT GET ANYWHERE ARE KIND OF IN THE AREAS OF EITHER MISSION REDUCTIONS OR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SCHOOLS. IF WE DON'T INCORPORATE ON THE LAND USE INTO -- SIX ONE SEVEN AND AND FINALLY. CAN YOU CAN I'M CLEAR THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE HERE BUT PROVIDING STRONG DIRECTION TO TO CARP TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE TO SELECTION OF COMMUNITIES IS TRANSPARENT AND EQUITABLE AND MAKING SURE ESPECIALLY THAT RURAL COMMUNITIES. HAVE A FAIR CHANCE OF BEING SELECTED AS URBAN COMMUNITIES THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU. SPEAKER. GOOD EVENING -- MY NAME IS KELLY TREVINO AND I'M IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST FOR THE CITY OF FRESNO. I WOULD LIKE TO FEET READ THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF OUR MAYOR LEE BRANDS -- GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT MAYOR BROWN WANTED TO BE HERE HIMSELF BUT DUE TO A PREVIOUS COMMITMENT HE WAS UNABLE SO YOU GOT ME -- DEAR CHAIR FRIEDMAN AND COMMITMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AS PRESIDENT MAHER I WANT TO THANK THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT STAFF FOR CONDUCTING ASSEMBLY BILL SIX ONE AT SEVEN'S LOCAL STEERING COMMITTEE MEETINGS. THE STAFF HAS WORKED HARD TO FIND A CONSENSUS AMONG THE VARIOUS STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE CITY OF FRESNO HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND PRESIDENT AT PRESENT AT EVERY MEETING BECAUSE WE DESIRE CLEAN AIR AND WANT TO WORK FOR REASONABLE AND SENSIBLE AIR QUALITY SOLUTIONS AND FRESNO AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THAT BEING SAID I HAVE DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THE STEERING COMMITTEE'S CURRENT DIRECTION. THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE DELIBERATIONS SO FAR HAS BEEN THE OVE TO DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THE BOUNDARY FOR OUR AB SIX ONE SEVEN STEERING COMMITTEE TO INCLUDE MOST OF FRESNO'S INDUSTRIALLY ZONED AREAS. WITH FRESNO COUNTY'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT EIGHT POINT AVERAGE. THE CITY NEEDS TO HAVE INDUSTRIALLY ZONED LAND READY FOR INDUSTRY TO BRING A BADLY NEEDED JOBS TO THE REGION. THE AREAS THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE EXPANDED AB SIX SEVENTEEN AREA IS A RURAL PROPERTY WITH ONLY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF HOMES THIS LAND HAS BEEN ZONED AND PLANS FOR INDUSTRIAL GROWTH FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS. WELL WE AT THE CITY OF FRESNO CERTAINLY SUPPORT REASONABLE AND SENSIBLE AIR POLICIES WE SIMPLY MUST HAVE PROPERTY AVAILABLE FOR INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION. WITH NEARLY FORTY ONE THOUSAND OF OUR RESIDENTS LOOKING FOR WORK ON ANY GIVEN DAY WE MUST HAVE LAND AVAILABLE FOR BUSINESS ATTRACTION EXPANSION AND RETENTION. NOT TO MENTION THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PART TIME WORKERS LOOKING FOR FULL TIME WORK. PEOPLE LOOKING FOR BETTER JOBS AND THOSE INVOLVED IN THE NEO AND WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAMS. FRESNO'S NEED FOR QUALITY JOB IS BEYOND TANGIBLE. WE CANNOT SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF OUR AB SIX SEVENTEEN BOUNDARIES AND ASKED THAT THE LINES REMAIN AS ORIGINALLY RECOMMENDED BY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THANK YOU FOR HEARING MY COMMENT CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROCESS IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU WITH RESPONSES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR ANYONE ELSE WANT TO SPEAK [inaudible] YES. GOOD EVENING THANK YOU FOR THE TIME -- MADAM CHAIR AND TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERIC PAIN AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY URBAN INSTITUTE. TIME IN FRESNO -- AND ONE OF THEM BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I ALWAYS SAY -- MUCH OF THIS CONVERSATION -- SPECIFICALLY FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS BEEN CENTERED AROUND. THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT -- BOUNDARY LINES -- AND THAT'S ACTUALLY MY NEIGHBORHOOD -- I ALWAYS SAY THAT I'M JUST THE GUY -- FOR AND AND WITH THAT. YOU KNOW WHY WE WHY WE ADMIRE THE MAYOR'S -- EFFORTS TO INCREASE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES -- BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE BURDENED BY A COMMUNITY -- OF COLOR -- AND MUCH OF THOSE THAT ARE DISENFRANCHISED IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD -- SUFFER FROM -- DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO GENERAL PLAN -- WERE AFRICAN AMERICANS ARMENIANS AND OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BUY PURCHASE HOMES -- ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TWO HERE WE ARE AND RAVELING DECADES OF POOR POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN DRAFTED BY -- PUBLIC OFFICIALS WITHIN OUR CITY GOVERNMENT I'M AND WE ARE CHALLENGED WITH -- HOW DO WE TAKE CORRECTIVE MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT? MY CHILDREN AND MY CHILDREN'S CHILDREN -- DON'T HAVE TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF POOR AIR QUALITY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD -- BUT ALSO WE WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS OF BEING A COLLECTIVE SPIRIT OF COLLABORATION -- TO ENSURE THAT -- AS WE WORK WITH OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO MOVE THIS POLICY FORWARD AND THAT -- WE ARE NOT -- OSTRACIZED THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND SO FOR ME -- I COME TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS -- AS A RESIDENT. THAT LIVES IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD -- AN **** AND THAT THIS COMMITTEE TO RACE AND OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND TAKE -- TAKE HEED IN AND LISTEN TO THE VOICES -- FROM THOSE THAT HAVE TRAVELED OVER TWO AND A HALF HOURS TO BE HERE TODAY I'M AND I THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU I THINK -- THE LAST SPEAKER. YES. I'M STEVE BIRD NOW -- RESIDENT OF FRESNO AND MEMBER OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE THERE. I'M HERE TO FORMALLY COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CENTRAL AREA OF VALLEY AIR DISTRICT SUPERVISION OF THE SIX SEVENTEEN MEETINGS. AT FEBRUARY MEETING OUR COMMITTEE DECIDED TO EXPAND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PROGRAM. AND WE CAME TO A CLEAR AND DOCUMENTED CONSENSUS ON THIS ISSUE. WE HEARD NO CONCERNS RAISED BY THE DISTRICT AT THAT TIME -- OUR COMMUNITY ADVOCACY GROUP -- AFTERWARD REACHED OUT TO THE DISTRICTS TO ASSIST WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS EXPANSION. AT OUR MARCH MEETING WITH MINIMAL PREPARATION TIME GIVEN TO THE COMMITTEE. THE DISTRICT SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT FOLLOW THE COMMUNITIES CONSENSUS. THEY CITED THE PRINCIPLE THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP TO A ARBY'S ORIGINAL BOUNDARIES AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE. THE MARCH MEETING WAS TOTALLY CONSUMED BY AGAIN REVISITING THE EXPANSION OF BOUNDARIES ISSUE. BUT AS THE DISTRICT WAS UNABLE TO DEFINITIVELY CITE ANY SPECIFIC TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THE CONSENSUS BOUNDARIES. FOR WITH ANY NEW PROPOSALS. WE COULD HAVE VERY LITTLE MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION. IN THE END THE DISTRICT PROMISED ONLY TO TAKE OUR SUGGESTIONS INTO ACCOUNT. WHEN DECIDING THE BOUNDARIES ON THEIR OWN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS? THE PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT IN THE SIX SEVENTEEN CHARTER SAYS THAT MEMBERS SHALL RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN A SWIFT POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER. BY ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN THE MEETINGS. THE CLEAR VIEW OF THE COMMUNITY IS THAT THIS DISTRICT FAILED TO RAISE CONCERNS IN ANY TIMELY MANNER [inaudible] FAILED -- TO FACILITATE A WAY TO RESOLVE THIS CONFLICT. WE CANNOT PROCEED IF THE DISTRICT DOESN'T PLAY BY THE RULES FOR EFFECTIVE DISCUSSION THAT THEY THEMSELVES LAID DOWN. WE CANNOT ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF A PLAN INFORMED BY THE COMMUNITY. IF THE DISTRICT DISREGARDS THE WILL OF THE COMMUNITY. THE MEMBERS OF THE FRESNO STEERING COMMUNITY OF LIKE MANY OTHER -- COMMITTEES ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE TODAY. SO WE NEED SIX SEVENTEEN TO SUCCEED. WE ARE DESPERATE TO MOVE PAST THE BOUNDARY ISSUE AND HAS START HAVING THE REAL CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. TO REACH THE BALANCE BETWEEN A HEALTHY JOB MARKET AND BEING ABLE TO BREATHE. AT SIX MONTHS INTO THE PROGRAM. AS FAR AS A COMMUNITY INPUT GOES THE FEELING IS THAT WE ARE STILL AT SQUARE. ONE OUR STEERING COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED NONE OF THE PROPOSED AND EVALUATED RULES THAT. MISTER SHEIKH DESCRIBED IN HIS PRESENTATION ALL OF THAT HAS ALSO BEEN DONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTARY I WILL NOW TURN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA FOR CLOSING COMMENTS AT ONE A SURVEY THINKING THE CHAIR FOR HOSTING THIS -- HEARING TODAY AND GIVING THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CHECK IN OF WHERE WE'RE AT ON ON THIS BILL AND THE WORK THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT I THINK EVERYONE NOT. THAT JUST. IF YOU STICK AROUND OR NOT THEY MADE THE TRIP OUT HERE BUT I THINK THE WORK THAT'S BEING THAT IN THE COMMUNITY. I WAS REFLECTING ON YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY AND LIKE YOU I LIVE IN THIS AND A COMMUNITIES JUST LIKE YOURS A COMMUNITY THAT -- FOR GENERATIONS HAS BEEN TREATED LIKE A WEST LINE AND OUR CONSTITUENTS TREAT ELECTRIC DISPOSABLE. AND YOU KNOW I GO HOME I GO HOME TO IT EVERY WEEKEND AND I WANT TO SEE AB SIX SEVENTEEN BE SUCCESSFUL I WANT TO SEE THESE. TEN A COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SELECTED BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY WILL BE THE BLUEPRINT FOR THE ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO COME ALONG THE WAY AND I THINK. THAT THERE ARE DEFINITELY A LOT OF LESSONS TO BE. TO BE HAD I THINK THAT THIS QUESTION AROUND BOUNDARIES IS IMPORTANT I THINK THE DISCUSSION AROUND. LAND USE IS IMPORTANT -- THE DISCUSSION OF IS IMPORTANT AND SO I HOPE THAT. THE AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT THEY ARE BE AT THE LOCAL OR DISTRICTS WE ALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO DO NOW TO THE PROCESS AND THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF THERE IS A CONSENSUS AND IS THE PHONE THAT WHERE WE WERE WITH THAT WERE YOU WE WERE AT TO BEGIN WITH. HOW DID WE ADOPT SOME OF THAT CONSENSUS? ALONG THE WAY SO THAT IT IS COMMUNITY DRIVEN THIS IS ONLY GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL OF THE COMMUNITY IS IS AT THE TABLE AND THEY HAVE BODY AND I HAVE HEARD. OF A WIDE RANGE OF THAT AND SO I AM HOPEFUL ACTUALLY YOU KNOW AND AND NOT EVERYONE IS HAPPY IN THIS PROCESS AND I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT IT CONSTANTLY. BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT WE HAVE SOME. STEPS THAT WE COULD TAKE TO BE IN A IN A BETTER PLACE ACROSS THE STATE LATE. WITH THESE COMMUNITIES -- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TWO CARBS LEADERSHIP TO HELP US FIND SOME SOLUTIONS -- AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO TO THE CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE FRUSTRATED PLEASE DON'T LEAVE WE ARE LISTENING AND I DON'T KNOW HOW QUICKLY WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE SAME PLACE BUT WE NEED YOUR INPUT TO TRY TO CREATE A PLAN THAT. THAT IS SUCCESSFUL AND I KNOW THAT'S ASKING A LOT FOR COMMUNITY MET THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE WAITING. BUT THIS IS A TO WE HAVE AND I'VE ALWAYS IT IS NOT THE ONLY TO WE NEED BUT THIS LITTLE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK BEFORE I COULD FIGHT FOR ADDITIONAL TOOLS I NEEDED -- TO MOVE FORWARD. SO THANK YOU ALL. THANKS I ALSO WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO CAME AND TESTIFIED PARTICULARLY THE ACTIVISTS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR SO LONG -- ON THESE ISSUES IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA FOR SPEARHEADING THIS EFFORT AND FROM WATCHING IT FROM MY SIDE OF THE ROOM. AS A COLLEAGUE I KNOW THAT IT WAS A REALLY HUGE TASK FOR HER -- TO TAKE ON AND SHE WORKED VERY VERY HARD ON TRYING. TO I'M A CREATE THIS TOOL AND ALSO TO GET IT YOU KNOW OVER THE FINISH LINE AND NOW SHE'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY VERY CONCERNED WITH THE OLD IMPLEMENTATION IS REALLY THERE TO TO SEE IT THROUGH SO I COMMEND YOU. FOR ALL OF THAT WORK -- YOU KNOW LISTENING TO THIS TO ME REALLY IT LISTENING TO THE AMOUNT OF TESTIMONY THAT WE HAD IN THE PASSION THAT WE HEARD FROM SO MANY PEOPLE. SHOWS WHAT IMPORTANT TOOL THIS REALLY ISA MORE POWERFUL TOOL AND IT SEEMS TO ME AS A YOU KNOW AS AS YOU BROUGHT UP THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERE ARE REGULATIONS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS WHAT WHAT'S BEEN MISSING OVER THE YEARS. WAS A FORMALIZED APPROACH TO REALLY BRINGING THE COMMUNITY TO THE TABLE -- IN A MEANINGFUL WAY SO THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE YOU KNOW IT -- EXTREMELY IMPACTED BY PUT BY POLLUTION -- BUT THEY'RE ALSO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED AND NEVER NEVER REALLY LISTEN TO NEVER BROUGHT TO THE TABLE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SO HAVING A TOOL LIKE THIS THAT REALLY FORCES. THEM TO BE LISTENED TO AND AND GIVE SOME THAT SEAT AT THE TABLE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THE RANGE OF EXPERIENCES. IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THERE'S CERTAINLY -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LESSEN LEARNING OVER THE PAST YEAR AND NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT STARTED OUT BEING MAYBE. I'M -- NOT REALLY FORMED AND REALLY STARTING TO HONE IN ON FOR WHAT THAT INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY IN THAT INDIVIDUAL DISTRICT. IS WORKING AND THAT'S GREAT NEWS -- LESSONS THAT I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD -- YOU KNOW INTO THE NEXT ROUND OF COMMUNITIES AND AND YOU KNOW IS THIS MOVES INTO THE FUTURE. I'M ALSO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YOU KNOW FRUSTRATION AT YOU KNOW SLOWNESS IN SOME AREAS OF PERCEPTION THAT THINGS AREN'T MOVING AS QUICKLY AS THEY WOULD LIKE AND SO. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY ENCOURAGING TO SEE. THE AMOUNT OF PASSIONATE PEOPLE WEREN'T PASSIONATE THEN. YOU KNOW WE WOULDN'T HAVE A TOOL THAT WAS REALLY USED AND THEY STAYED HOME IT'S BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SEE VALUE IN THIS SO I THINK THAT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE. ARE DEDICATED TO MAKING THE MOST OF IT AND MAKING IT WORK BECAUSE WE KNOW AT THIS POINT. HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS FOR THE COMMUNITIES WE'VE HEARD IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN -- I THINK I THINK YOU KNOW I'M REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THAT AND CLEARLY WILL HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN IN CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. TO SEE WHETHER SEIZE THESE KINGS ARE KIND OF WORKING OUT -- I MADE A WHOLE BUNCH OF NOTES BUT I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO AYE AYE. I CAN'T POSSIBLY GO GO DOWN THESE AND READ THIS AT THIS POINT BUT I WANT TO AGAIN THANK EVERYBODY AND I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TAKING A LOT OF NOTES APPEAR SO WILL BE A LOT OF MORE CONVERSATIONS. FROM OUR SIDE AND WITHIN THIS BUILDING -- ABOUT -- THE BILL SO THANKS AGAIN AND THANKS TO STAFF -- AND EVERYBODY ELSE. OKAY WITH THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR MEETING
