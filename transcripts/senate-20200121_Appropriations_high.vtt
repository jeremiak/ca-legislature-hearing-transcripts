THOUSAND CALIFORNIA ADOPTED TWO

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:29.902
PIECES OF LEGISLATION ONE WAS

BY SENATOR RAINY AND ANOTHER

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:33.739
WAS BY SENATOR SPEAR. AND IT

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:36.475

AND AGAIN THIS WAS TWENTY YEARS

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:49.889
AGO. THERE WAS A CLAUSE IN THE

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:51.691
LAW THAT ALLOWED COUNTIES TO

THAT ALL OF THE COUNTIES COMPLY

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.723
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW COUNTIES

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.324

REMAINS UNIDENTIFIED AND SHE'S

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:26.252
ON IDENTIFIED BECAUSE EITHER

LAW ENFORCEMENT DIDN'T TAKE DNA

DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IT'S THAT
