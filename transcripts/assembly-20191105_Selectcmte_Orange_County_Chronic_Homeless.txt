MEMBER OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I SOUGHT TO WORK WITH OUR LEADERSHIP TO BE SELECT IS THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND WITH THAT THE PRIMARY REASON IS SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY NOT ONLY OPPORTUNITIES STRENGTH IN ONGOING WORKING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ADVOCATES NONPROFITS THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS WELL AS LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT TO COMBAT ORANGE COUNTY'S COM CHRONIC HOMELESS POPULATION THAT BEING SAID WHAT WE DO IN HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY IS NOT ONLY FOCUSED ON ORANGE COUNTY AS WE KNOW MANY MANY IF NOT ALL COUNTIES IN ORANGE COUNTY ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME ISSUES ORANGE

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LISA ANGLE I THANK YOU SO MUCH AND A GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY -- IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO COME DOWN AND SEE YOUR COMMUNITY AND REALLY LEARN ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WHAT YOU'RE CHALLENGES ARE I AM THE CHIEF CONSULTANT TO THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE I'VE WORKED FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR OVER A DECADE ON HOUSING AND POLICY ISSUES AND LIKE YOU I'VE SEEN THE HOMELESS AND HOUSING CRISIS WORSEN OVER TIME TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE MORE THAN HALF OF THE STATE RIGHT STATES RENTER'S PAY OVER THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME TO HOUSING AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF RENTERS PAY MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT TOWARDS HOUSING WHICH MAKES THEM EXTREMELY RENT BURDENED SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA IS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY HOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE ON SHELTERED ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT AND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS -- PEOPLE ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS AND THE CHAIR TALKED ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS SO I'M JUST GONNA TRY AND QUICKLY GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE STATE'S DONE OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AROUND HOMELESSNESS AND THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT IN SACRAMENTO THAT COMMUNITIES ARE DOING IT TO TRY AND ADDRESS THE CRISIS SO FIRST -- THAT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE STATE HOMELESS COORDINATES CORDONING OF FINANCING COUNSEL TO TRY TO BETTER COORDINATE STATE RESOURCES ACROSS MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES ALL HAVE HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS AND SO THE IDEA WAS TO GET THEM TALKING TO EACH OTHER I ONE OF THE FIRST TASKS OF THE COUNCIL WAS TO ADOPT THEM HOUSING FIRST AS A MODEL FOR ALL STATE HOUSING PROGRAMS HOUSING FIRST AS AN EVIDENCE BASED MODEL USING HOUSING AS A TOOL AND NOT A REWARD AND CONNECTING PEOPLE TO PERMANENT HOUSING SO HOUSING IS NOT CONTINGENT UPON PARTICIPATING IN SERVICES AND THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE MAJOR BEST PRACTICES I THINK WE'VE REALLY SHIFTED FEDERALLY AND STATEWIDE TO ADOPT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS I'M IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN -- THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A MAJOR PACKAGE OF BILLS WHICH INCLUDED TWO NEW FUNDING SOURCES SB TWO WHICH IS A PERMANENT SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE FIRST YEAR HALF OF THE FUNDS GO TO HOMELESSNESS AND IN THE SECOND YEAR SEVENTY PERCENT OF THOSE FUNDS GO DIRECTLY TO LOCALS THIS IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THOSE FUNDS AS A WAY TO POTENTIALLY ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS LOCALLY WE ALSO PASSED SB THREE WHICH WAS AT THE HOUSING BOND WHICH INCLUDED THREE MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE VOTERS AND THE LEGISLATURE HAD PASSED A HOUSING BONDS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX SO IT WAS SORELY NEEDED AM WE ALSO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PASSED A BILL TO ALLOW JURISDICTIONS A CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS TO WAIVE LOCAL LAND USE POLICIES IN ORDER TO BUILD SHELTERS -- WE PASSED THEM AB SEVENTY FOUR WHICH CREATED THE HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROGRAM THIS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY TARGETS PEOPLE WHO ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS AND MEDICARE RECIPIENTS TO TIE THEM TO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING TO REDUCE THEIR HEALTHCARE COSTS BECAUSE THESE FOLKS TYPICALLY HAVE OF A HIGH COST TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND WE CAN GREATLY REDUCE THAT BY GETTING THEM INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND THE PROGRAM WILL TRACK OF THE COST OF HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO DETERMINE HOW HOW MUCH THE HOUSING HAS ON THERE HOW MUCH IMPACT THE HOUSING HAS IN THEIR HEALTHCARE COSTS -- AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THINGS REALLY PICKED UP IN THE LEGISLATURE AROUND HOMELESSNESS IN TERMS OF FUNDING -- WE THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO A PROGRAM TO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MY MEMORY THAT A SIGNIFICANT FUND OF CHEN AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND DOLLARS WENT TO THIS PURPOSE AND IT WAS REALLY INTENDED TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO PASSED TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO WHICH ALLOWS FOR STREAMLINING FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THIS WAS MODELED AFTER AN ORDINANCE THAT LOS ANGELES PASSED SO IF THE DEVELOPMENT IS A HUNDRED PERCENT AFFORDABLE AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE UNITS ARE RESTRICTED TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND THAT DEVELOPER CAN GO IN AND GET THE PROJECT APPROVED BY RIGHT AND THEN -- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FROM YOUR COMMUNITY CARRIED -- AB FOUR FOUR EIGHT WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE CREATION REALLY THE REVITALIZATION OF THE ORANGE COUNTY HOUSING TRUST FUND TO ALLOW THE COUNTY AND CITY COUNTY AND CITIES THAT WANTED TO PARTICIPATE TO CREATE A TRUST FUND AND THIS WILL HELP THEM YOU ALL APPLY FOR AND SB THREE FUNDS WHICH ARE GONNA BECOME AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR THROUGH THE LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FUND -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATED ANOTHER SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO ASSIST LOCALS IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS -- IN THE BUDGET WE STREAMLINED LOW BARRIER NAVIGATION CENTERS LOW BARRIER NAVIGATION CENTERS ARE A GOOD -- THE HIGHLIGHT AS A BEST PRACTICE THESE ARE SHELTERS THAT ARE SERVICE ENRICHED -- THEY MOVE PEOPLE TO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT ONSITE LOW BARRIER REFERS TO THE FACT THAT -- BARRIERS ARE REDUCED TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO COME INDOORS SO THEY ALLOW FOR THE PRESENCE OF PARTNERS PETS STORAGE OF POSSESSIONS AND PRIVACY -- THE LEGISLATURE PASSED EVEN FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH IS A STATE WIDE RENT GOUGING CAP AND JUST BECAUSE TO PROTECT TENANTS IN PLACE -- IT IS A HAS A TEN YEAR SUNSET AND PASSED -- ESPY'S AT TWO BILLS TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS AND VAST VOUCHERS SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP THOSE VOUCHERS BE MORE USEFUL IN THE COMMUNITY AM THEN WE ALSO X. THROUGH THE -- CHAIRS BILL EXPANDED AS THE ASH SHELTER CRISIS ACT TO ALLOW THE COUNTY THE ORANGE COUNTY IN THE CITY'S ORANGE COUNTY TO WAIVE LOCAL LAND USE POLICIES IN ORDER TO BUILD SHELTERS MORE QUICKLY SB FOUR FIFTY WHICH MAKES IT EASIER FOR COMMUNITIES TO COMFORT HOTELS AND MOTELS TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING BY CREATING A SEQUEL EXCEPTION SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES OR STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS THE SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS IS TO GET PEOPLE INTO HOUSING AND THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT WE KNOW THAT HOUSING FIRST IS AN EFFECTIVE MODEL TO DO THAT IT'S PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THEY OFTEN HAVE DISABLED DISAIT UP YOU KNOW ADDICTION ISSUES HOUSE AND SO BY ALLOWING THEM TO COME INTO HOUSING FIRST AND THEN DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES SECOND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO COME IN -- STE HOUSING FIRST PAIRED WITH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH IS HOUSING THAT IS ACCOMPANIED WITH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IT HAS A NINETY EIGHT PERCENT SECOND SUCCESS RATE ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE TO END HOMELESSNESS SO A VARIETY OF COMMUNITIES HAVE TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING A LOS ANGELES PASSED HHH WHICH IS ONE POINT TWO BILLION TO FIND HOPEFULLY TEN THOUSAND NEW SUPPORT OF HOUSING UNITS ALAMEDA COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY EACH PASS BOND MEASURES TO FIND HOUSING FOR VULNERABLE LOWER INCOME PEOPLE -- AGAIN LOW BARRIER NAVIGATION CENTERS WERE SEEN HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY AS WELL SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES WITH WHERE YOU'RE REDUCING THE BARRIERS AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO COME INDOORS SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE SUPPLEMENTING VASH AND SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS SO THOSE VOUCHERS CAN BE USED TO PAY -- RENT THE RENT OF LOWER INCOME PEOPLE BUT SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH IN THE MARKET SO HAD CAPS THE FAIR MARKET RENT OR THE AMOUNT THAT VOUCHER CAN BE USED TO PAY SO SOME SAN DIEGO FOR EXAMPLE IS SUBSIDIZING THOSE BE A POTENTIAL USE FOR SB TO FUNDS WHICH ARE AGAIN A VERY FLEXIBLE SOURCE OF FUNDING AND LOCALS GET TO DECIDE HOW TO SPEND THEM THOSE FUNDS JUST A I DON'T THINK I MENTIONED EARLIER WILL BECOME AVAILABLE THIS YEAR ANOTHER SOLUTION THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE PURSUING IS A PLACE BASED MODEL LOCATING BRIDGE HOUSING IN COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS WERE FORMALLY HOMELESS SO COMMON MYTH IS THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE NOT FROM THE COMMUNITY BUT A UC DAVIS ARE UC IRVINE STUDY FOUND THAT SEVEN OUT OF TEN PEOPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT ARE HOMELESS HAD LIVED IN THE COUNTY IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THIS IS ALSO COMMON MYTH ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO BUT HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE UNTRUE SOME COMMUNITIES ARE TRYING TO LOCATE MULTIPLE SHELTERS CLOSE TO WHERE PEOPLE PREVIOUSLY LIVED -- SOMETIMES IT'S BRIDGE HOUSING BRIDGE HOUSING TYPICALLY HAS A LIMIT ON THE STATE BUT FOCUSES ON MOVING PEOPLE INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING I'M CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE STARTING TO COLLABORATE REGIONALLY OR SEEN THAT HERE THRILLED THAT NORTH SPA PARTNERSHIP THAT YOU'VE DEVELOPED TO BILL TWO FULL SERVICE NAVIGATION CENTERS THE FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE THROUGH HALF REQUIRE A REGIONAL PLAN SO THAT'S A WAY TO SORT OF ENCOURAGE -- LOCAL -- COLLABORATION -- WERE ALSO SEEING A MOTEL AND HOTEL CONVERSIONS WHICH ARE ALL OPTIONAL FOR SHELTER OR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BECAUSE THEY ARE YOUR CONFIGURED AS A SINGLE ROOM WITH BATHROOMS AND SOMETIMES KITCHENETTES MOTELS CAN SOMETIMES BEEN THE SITE OF PAST CRIMINAL ACTIVITY SO BY CONVERTING THEM TO SHELTERS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THEY CAN BE TURNED INTO A USEFUL PART OF THE COMMUNITY SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE ALIGNING AT THEIR HOMELESS AND HOUSING DEPARTMENTS SO THAT THEY HAVE A SHARED VISION BECAUSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY IS A SIGNIFICANT IF NOT THE SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE CREATING LOCAL FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POLLS -- THESE POOLS ARE AND MOST CASES ARE TARGETED AT PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGH USERS OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SO THEY'RE FOCUSED ACHIEVING HOUSING STABILITY RESOURCES FOR HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND CASE MANAGEMENT IN LA THEY TARGETED THEIR HIGHEST USERS OF THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES THEY USED TO BETTER CAL DOLLARS PHILANTHROPIC FUNDS AND LOCAL FUNDS SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE USING THESE FUNDS TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSE TO FILL IN THE GAPS SO IF YOU'RE MISSING YOUR FIRST MONTH'S RENT IF YOU NEED A SECURITY DEPOSIT FOCUSED AT PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS OTHERS ARE USING IT AS A LANDLORD INCENTIVE TO RENT TO THE LOCAL POPULATIONS BY SETTING FUNDS ASIDE THAT CAN BE DRAWN DOWN FOR SECURITY DEPOSITS FURNISHINGS ANTENNA DAMAGES SO I PUT TOGETHER JUST SOME POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST BUT AT THE STATE SORT OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER TO SUPPORT -- LOCAL EFFORTS -- FIRST IS THAT CALIFORNIA FUNDS OVER TAVERN EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT ENDING HOMELESSNESS AT SIX DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS AND EACH DEPARTMENT HAS A DIFFERENT MISSION CULTURE AND KNOWLEDGE OF HOUSING RELATED OR HOUSING ISSUES THE CHAIR CARRIED A BILL LAST YEAR AB SIXTEEN TO TRYING TO LINE THOSE -- DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND THAT WOULD BE A WAY TO CREATE COST EFFICIENCIES AND TO REALLY NOT REALLY DETERMINE KIND OF WHAT OUR -- INVESTMENT IS AND HOW TO STREAMLINE IT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN USING MEDICAL FUNDS TO THE FEDERAL HOLE PERSON PILOT TO PAY FOR SERVICES IN CASE MANAGEMENT AND WRAP AROUND SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT IS COMING TO AN END BUT DH CS HAS PUT OUT A NEW CONCEPT TO CREATE A BENEFIT AROUND SERVICES CASE MANAGEMENT TO POTENTIALLY TAKE THAT -- PLACE OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT AND AGAIN THIS IS A WAY TO TRY AND PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT AND SERVICES TO HOUSE OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS AM WE ALSO COULD CREATE A STATEWIDE DATA WAREHOUSE TO COORDINATE RESOURCES AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS -- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ALSO LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS -- WHICH IS A GREAT IDEA WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT SORT OF WHAT HOW TO -- FOCUS THOSE ON THOSE THAT ARE TRULY AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS FOR A FEW MONTHS TEND TO HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING BACK INTO HOUSING BECAUSE THEY LOSE THEIR JOB THEY HAVE HEALTH IMPACTS AND SO WE NEED TO THINK THIS IS A A GOOD WE ARE SEEING AND MORE PEOPLE FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS AS WE TRIED TO HOUSE PEOPLE SO WE NEED TO PUSH THESE IDEAS FOR BUT THINK ABOUT HOW TO DO IT BEST AND THEN FINALLY THEY -- HOMELESS POPULATION IS POPULATION IS AGING AS OUR OVERALL POPULATION IS AGING RESEARCH BY MARGARET WHO SHALL WITH YOU SEE AS AFTER SHOWS THAT A GROWING STATEMENT OF HOMELESS OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION OUR SENIORS SHE FOUND THAT AMERICANS BORN IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE BABY BOOM NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE TO NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE HAVE AN ELEVATED RISK OF HOMELESSNESS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIME AND SHE FOUND THAT SOME SENIORS HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS WILL PICK BUT WE'RE BECOMING HOMELESS BECAUSE OF A SUDDEN HEALTH CRISIS ARE JOB LOSS OR A SPOUSE DYING AND MANY ARE IN POOR HEALTH SO SENIORS ARE REALLY ACUTELY -- IMPACTED BY THE HOUSING CRISIS AMONG THE RENTER'S AGE FIFTY YEAR OVER THIRTY PERCENT SPEND MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME AND RENT AND ARE CONSIDERED -- SEVERELY HOUSING BURDENED SO WE NEED TO THINK THERE'S STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THIS GROWING SENIOR HOMELESS POPULATION AND THAT'S MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU THANK YOU EARLY SIR BEFORE WE TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS UP HERE AND ALL WE'LL JUST DO THAT INDIVIDUALLY AS EACH POUND SPEAKS I THINK AND I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE WE HAVE SO CITY MANAGERS AND FOR MANY OF YOU WHO LOOK AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND AND EVERYTHING THEY DO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS REALIZE IS THAT CITY MANAGERS AND -- CITIES WHERE -- YOUR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE NOT FULL TIME WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH EVERY CITY OTHER THAN MAYBE A LOS ANGELES AND SOME OF THE MAJOR CITIES THE CITY MANAGER'S ARE NOT ONLY AS INVESTED BUT PLAY A HUGE ROLE AND HOW POLICY AND EVERYTHING FROM ORDINANCES ANYTHING THAT APPEARS ON AGENDA CALMS -- MAIN MANY TIMES FROM THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS -- CITY MANAGER SO WE HAVE HERE WITH US JIM VANDERPOOL REPRESENTING MURRAY REPRESENTING LOW PAMA WE HAVE CAN DO DELMER CITY MANAGER FULLER TEN AND WE HAVE ANAHEIM AND THIS IS A BIG DEAL AND I SAY THAT THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE JUST BARELY RAISING THEIR HAND BUT THE REASON IS TO RUN A CITY IS A HUGE IN THAT TIME AND THEY HAVE EVERYTHING LITERALLY FROM FIRES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN FULLER TEN ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT THEY'RE CHOOSING TO SPEND ONE OR TWO HOURS WITH THIS IS A REALLY MEANINGFUL BECAUSE I THINK THAT -- IT SHOWS THERE I'M SIR WE HAVE AARON FRANCE FROM THE CITY OF ONE OF PARK BUT IF YOU ARE ALSO WORKING FOR A CITY OR INVOLVED IN THE GOVERNMENT HOUSING POLICY WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAND UP SO WE KIND OF KNOW WHO WERE WHO'S OUT THERE YOU'RE EITHER WORKING FOR THE COUNTY YOU'RE WORKING FOR THE STATE YOUR WORKING FOR A CITY THERE SOMEBODY RAISING HER HAND BACK THERE -- TOBY STAND UP IT'S OKAY HEY LOOK WE WANT TO SEE YOU THERE WE GO SO THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE ALL THE STUFF THAT PEOPLE LIKE A SAY THAT IT YOU KNOW WHY ARE WE DOING THIS AND THEN THEY SIT THERE AND THEY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT SOMETIMES IT'S A GOOD IDEA AND SOMETIMES IS LIKE WHO THE HECK ARE THESE PEOPLE TELLING US TO DO ALL THESE THINGS SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PEOPLE HERE -- WITHOUT DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBER FOR -- LISA ANGLE THANKS FOR BEING HERE WITH US THIS MORNING I WANTED TO GET INTO I'M A POINT THAT YOU STARTED TO MAKE ABOUT THIS KIND OF BEWILDERING ARRAY OF PROGRAMS AND FUNDING STREAMS BECAUSE THEY TREAT TREAT AS WE'VE GOT A LOT WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY WE GOT A TON OF FUNDING PROGRAMS I'M IT'S INCREDIBLY CONFOUNDING I THINK FOR ALMOST ANYONE TO NAVIGATE AND I THINK WE FIND OURSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE UNLESS YOU'RE A REALLY BIG CITY ARE REALLY BIG NONPROFIT YOU CAN HIRE LIKE A FULL TIME GRANT WRITER ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCESS THESE FUNDS SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WE CAN DO TO STREAMLINE THIS AND GET YOUR MORE MONEY INTO I INTO THE COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY NEED IT WELL I THINK I AM STREAMLINING SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND AGAIN PART OF IT IS JUST HAVING A A COMMON APPLICATION PROCESS GUIDELINES WOULD BE HELPFUL THE DEPARTMENT HOUSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT DID AT ONE TIME HAVE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO HELP A SMALLER JURISDICTIONS APPLY FOR FUNDS I CAN LOOK AT THAT AND SEE IF THAT STILL IN EXISTENCE BUT I MEAN IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF WILL TO RE ORGANIZE THINK WE KIND OF LACK A GLOBAL PLAN AROUND HOMELESSNESS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THAT WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT A STATEWIDE DATABASE WOULD ALSO DO THAT IT GIVE US A CHANCE TO SEE REALLY WHERE INVESTMENTS ARE GOING WHERE LOCALS ARE VESTING AND HOW WE CAN SUPPORT LOCALS I'M IN PICKING UP ON THAT SO RIGHT NOW WHAT ARE WE DOING TO TRAFFIC TRACK THE EFFICACY OF STATE DOLLARS IN HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE MONEY WE'RE INVESTING IS ACTUALLY WORKING OR NOT WELL THE HEAP IN THE HOUSE FUNDS WERE INTENDED TO BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD GO OUT QUICKLY AND HELP AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THIS THE HEAT FUNDS DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF REPORTING HAP HAS MORE REPORTING ABOUT HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SPENDING THE FUNDS SO THAT SHOULD GIVE US THE DATA AND SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING -- MANY OF THE HOUSING PROGRAMS THAT WE USE TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DO HAVE A REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SO I THINK AGAIN FIRST THE FIRST ROUND OF HE WAS REALLY INTENDED TO GET OUT QUICKLY THE SECOND ROUND OF HOP HAS MORE REPORTING AND MORE -- ABILITY TO LOOK AT HOW THE FUNDS ARE BEING VESTED OKAY AND THEN JUST TO CLARIFY AND HE'D BEEN HAPPY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN THE HOUSING WORLD SO KEEP WAS THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING AND IT'S SAD I CAN'T I CAN'T REMEMBER THE ACRONYM WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT IT'S HOMELESS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM HOMELESS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND THAT IS HEAP FUNDING AND HOW UP WILL BE AROUND TOO AND THAT WILL BE AND HALF IS HOMELESS HOUSING AND ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND THAT'S THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT'S GOING OUT THIS YEAR AND THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUUM'S OF CARE WHICH ARE LOCAL COUNTY ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS -- AROUND HOMELESSNESS -- CITIES THE BIG THIRTEEN CITIES NOW AND COUNTIES AS WELL OKAY SO WE GET KEEP AND HELPS THEM WILL BE VERY HAPPY NOW I'M JOKING BUT ACTUALLY ON THE -- STREAMLINING WE ARE OFFICE DID RUN ON THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING BILL WHICH WE HAD PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IN THE BILL AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR TOOK PIECES THAT HAVE OUT OF THAT AND PUT IT INTO IS -- PACKAGE AS FAR AS BUDGET BUT WE WILL RUN AGAIN STREAMLINING THE APPLICATION BECAUSE FOR SOME OF YOU WHO HAVE -- YOUNG ADULTS AND HELP THEM TO THE COLLEGE PROCESS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A FORMULA YOU APPLY TO MANY BUT THE SAME PARAMETERS ARE FOR MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT FOR A LOT OF THE INDIVIDUAL CITIES THEY MIGHT APPLY FOR ONE AND NOT KNOW WHAT ABOUT ANOTHER AND IF WE COULD STREAMLINE THAT SO MAYBE EVEN DEADLINES AND SO FORTH BECOME MUCH MORE LIKE THIS IS A TIME OR CITY HAS TO GET THESE APPLICATIONS IN IT I THINK IT STARTS TO SHIFT ON HOW CITIES LOCAL YOURS ARE LOOKING AT DID WE MISS THAT DEADLINE BUT IF YOU KNOW JUST SAY NOVEMBER IS OUR HOUSING -- TIME JUST LIKE WITH COLLEGE ADMISSIONS I THINK WE COULD START TO SEEK RECEIVE AN ORANGE COUNTY AND EAT AND OTHER COUNTIES THOSE DOLLARS THAT THE STATE HAS THAT WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO ATTAIN SO RIGHT ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT IT DOES IS TO YOUR POINT IT'S IF WE HAVE AN INTEGRATED IN KIND OF COHERENT STRATEGY AND THEY'RE SORT OF A SINGLE POINT OF MANAGEMENT IT'S IT'S MUCH EASIER TO THEN ASSESS WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT RATHER THAN THIS KIND OF MISHMASH SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO I THINK WE'LL GO HAD ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR OUR STATE AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THIS IS LISA ANGLE WORKING AS THE PRIMARY CONSULTANT STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IF YOU HAVE LEGISLATIVE IDEAS MAKE SURE YOU TALK TO HER ON THE WAY OUT AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANELIST AND BEFORE THAT I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE DO ALSO HAVE -- THE PLACENTIA CITY MANAGER AND IF YOU WILL STAFF TO STAND UP THAT IS DAMIEN A RUE LÀ THEY MET WELCOME AND -- WITH THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR NEXT PANELIST IN THAT IS MUHAMMAD ALI WHO IS THE ATTORNEY AND FOUNDER OF ORANGE COUNTY POVERTY ALLEVIATION COALITION SO MUCH IT'S AN INCREDIBLE HONOR TO BE HERE AND HONESTLY I COULDN'T SPEAK AS WELL ON THIS ISSUE -- AS SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE REALLY CERTAIN ASPECTS OF IT SO I'M MICHELLE MURPHY FROM THE UNITED WAY ACT ARE THE CAMPAIGNS AND HOMELESSNESS -- IS HERE AND I MEAN SHE COULD CERTAINLY TALK ABOUT -- THE VARIOUS INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO TRY TO INCENTIVIZE LANDLORDS TO ACCEPT -- TO ACCEPT SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS TO EXPAND OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK I'M IN GENERAL SEETHER COVERT CORPORATE RUBIO SAYS HERE FROM THE KENNEDY COMMISSION YOU CAN CERTAINLY SPEAK TO THE LEGAL ADVOCACY YOU KNOW CHALLENGING I'M CITIES COMPLIANCE -- WITH THE OTHER SB TO -- YOU KNOW VARIOUS LAWSUITS I'M THAT WE'VE BEEN BROUGHT BY KENNEDY COMMISSION REYES ADVOCACY AS WELL -- IT AND TERMS OF LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY OF WE ALSO HAVE LIKE ADVOCATES FROM THE ARM HOUSING IS HUMAN RIGHT ORANGE COUNTY SO I MEAN WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS HERE HAT -- DAVID -- MY FOR MY GOOD FRIEND REBEKAH IS HERE -- WE HAVE YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE I CAN THAT DEFINITELY SPEAK TO THE GRASSROOTS ADVOCACY AS WELL -- YOU KNOW ON THIS ISSUE -- BUT I WANTED TO REALLY FOCUS ON WHAT IS INNOVATIVE AND WHAT ISN'T REALLY BEING TALKED ABOUT -- AND I WANTED TO KIND OF I'M BEGIN WITH LIKE THE FAMILIAR PRINCIPLE THE EIGHTY TWENTY PRINCIPLE -- AND AND START WILL LIKE THIS NOTION THAT MAYBE MAYBE IT'S THE CASE THAT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION -- ARE REALLY GIVING ARM THE OTHER EIGHTY PERCENT -- THIS STIGMA OF CAUSING PROBLEMS A FEELING CRIME -- OF BEING THE ADDICTS OF OF BEING PEOPLE THAT AREN'T WORTH OUR HELP WHERE PEOPLE THAT IF WE DO TRY TO HELP IF WE DO TRY TO BUILD SHELTERS TO BE TO TRY TO BUILD HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITIES THEY'RE GOING TO CREATE ALL OF THESE -- YOU KNOW IT IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITIES WE CAN'T BUILD SHELTERS TO CLOSE TO SCHOOLS WE CAN'T BUILD SHELTERS TO COSTA HOMES THAT WILL IMPACT THEIR I HAVE BEEN IMPACTED PROPERTY VALUES CRIME THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THIS HOMELESSNESS POPULATION AND THE STIGMA I THINK IS THE REASON WHY YOU KNOW WE HAVE ALL THIS MONEY THAT YOU KNOW IS AVAILABLE IN ALL THESE IT YOU AGREE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE BUT REALLY OVER COMING -- THE PUBLIC OPPOSITION ESM -- TO PROVIDING SERVICES THAT IS A HUGE BARRIER AND IT'S HARD AND IT'S VERY RARE TO FIND THE LOCAL LEADER THE LOCAL -- YOU KNOW CITY COUNCIL MEMBER THAT'S WILLING TO STAND UP TO SOMETIMES OVERWHELMING PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO THESE PROGRAMS SO STARTING WITH THIS NOTION THAT MAYBE IT'S TIME TO FOCUS ON THAT TWENTY PERCENT AND REALLY START TO UNDERSTAND TRULY UNDERSTAND THEIR ISSUES -- YES WE DO HAVE THIS OUR ISSUE OF DRUG ADDICTION IS REALLY PREVALENT AMONG THIS POPULATION WHY DO WE HAVE THAT PROBLEM WHY IS THERE AN OPIATE CRISIS WELL IT'S BECAUSE I I WOULD I WOULD HUMBLY SUBMIT A WE AREN'T LOOK AT WE ARE EMPLOYING EVIDENCE BASED BEST PRACTICES IN DEALING WITH -- THIS INTERSECTION OF DRUG ADDICTION AND HOMELESSNESS AND WHAT IS THIS EVERY IT'S BASE BEST PRACTICE IT'S THE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR FOLKS THAT HAVE A AN OPIOID I USED TO SORT HER ARM AND WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT MEANS THE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT WHICH AGAIN IS RECOGNIZED YOU KNOW BY PHYSICIANS AS THE EVIDENCE BASE BEST PRACTICE FOR DEALING WITH OPIATE ADDICTION MEANS I'M COMBINING THERAPY WITH ARMED WITH ACTUAL YOU KNOW MEDICAL INTERVENTION IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW PHARMACEUTICALS I'M SO OPIATES AND AND AND FORGIVE ME I DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LIKE THE SCIENCE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LAWN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PUBLIC POLICY ON THIS ISSUE FOR US TO TRULY UNDERSTAND -- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE BEST WAY OF SOLVING THIS -- ABED SO STARTING WITH THE SCIENCE GIVE OPIATE RECEPTORS IN YOUR BRAIN PRODUCES ENDOGENOUS MORPHINE SO IT'S A IT'S A NATURALLY COMMIT ARE NATURALLY PRODUCED CHEMICAL IN YOUR BRAIN YOU PRODUCE AND DODGES WORKING OR INDOOR FAN -- IN ORDER TO CALM YOUR BODY DOWN IN ORDER TO NAM PAIN WHEN THERE'S BEEN AN INJURY YOU'RE NOT FREAKING OUT WHEN YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU BREAK YOUR LEG OR YOU HAVE AN INJURY -- SO YOU HAVE THESE THESE OPIATE RECEPTORS IN YOUR BRAIN AND YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY OPIATES WHICH ACT ON THE OPIATE RECEPTORS -- WHICH YOU KNOW DO WHAT YOU KNOW IT IT'S USED HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE IN OUT THAT THESE ARE IMPORTANT LEE YOU KNOW THIS THESE ARE IMPORTANT OCCASIONS USED YOU KNOW APPROPRIATELY ARM AND WE SHOULDN'T STIGMATIZE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY NEED -- YOU KNOW OUR PAIN MEDICATION THE SAME TIME OBVIOUSLY IT HAS THESE ARE FACTS OF IN OF -- INCREASING TOLERANCE AND ARE INCREASED IN THIS CONDITION OF IT OF OF ADDICTION ARM AND ALL UNFORTUNATELY WE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE WHEN YOU HAVE DOCTORS ON THAT ARE BEING LOBBIED BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO OVERLY PRESCRIBE ARM YOU KNOW THE OPIOID CRISIS NOW WE SEE YOU KNOW PROSECUTIONS AGAINST YOU KNOW THE FACT THEIR FAMILY AND PROSECUTIONS AGAINST IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY FOR FOR ESSENTIALLY CREATING -- YOU KNOW THIS OPIOID EPIDEMIC OF THAT LOCALLY -- WHEN WE ARE WE ARE SEEING THIS -- YOU KNOW IF ACTING -- AFFECTING EIGHT FOLKS IN ORANGE COUNTY CRISIS IN ORANGE COUNTY I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN KILEY PETRIE-NORRIS IS FOR FOCUSING ON THIS IN COSTA MESA -- WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THERE ARE PERHAPS AN IRRESPONSIBLE SOBER LIVING HOMES -- AND PEOPLE THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY CAME IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY ARM IN ORDER TO -- TO BUILD AS MUCH MONEY OUT OF INSURANCE POLICIES WERE ACTUALLY FIXING OUR WITH OUR ACTUALLY FIXING DOES THE CONDITION OF OPIOID ADDICTION THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING -- AND THEY'RE NOT USING EVIDENCE BASED BEST PRACTICES SO THAT SO EVIDENCE OF MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT USES A COUPLE DIFFERENT -- DRUGS IN ORDER TO -- IN ORDER TO EITHER BINDS TO THE OPIOID RECEPTORS ON AS A AS AN ANTAGONISED ARMS SO THE SO BUPRENORPHINE IS AN OPIOID ANTAGONISE WHICH MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE ON A DRUG CALLED BUPRENORPHINE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET HIGH IT HAS A GREATER AFFINITY TO THE OPIATE RECEPTORS WHICH MEANS YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET HIGH EVEN IF YOU WERE TO TRY YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT OF LOT OF HEROIN IN ORDER TO BLOW OFF THE -- PEOPLE ARE FAN OR YOU KNOW THE SUBOXONE RECEPTORS WHICH MEANS -- YOU EAT IT YOU YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO RELAPSE SEC AND IF YOU GET SOMEBODY ON THE STRUGGLE PEOPLE NORTH AND ARE YOU YOU ARE ABLE TO ESSENTIALLY GET THEM OUT OF THIS CONDITION OF THE WAY OUT OF THIS CONDITION OF HAVING THIS CRAVING FOR OPIATES AT THE SAME TIME -- AT THE SAME TIME -- PREVENT THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO RELAPSE -- THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS PEOPLE ARE FAN DALY AND OFTENTIMES WHEN PEOPLE WITH THE WORST PEOPLE WITH THIS OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TAKING THEIR MEDICATIONS THE TREATMENTS IN OUR JAILS AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN FIX LOCALLY AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN FIX STATEWIDE AND I DO THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS BECAUSE IF WE DON'T START TAKING THIS THIS AT THIS PROBLEM OF OPIATE ADDICTION IS OPIATE EPIDEMIC WHICH IS CLAIMING THE LIVES OF PEOPLE I'M FOR NOT ONLY HOMELESS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSE I'M AT ASTRONOMICAL LEVELS AND COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE LEVELS AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE AN END TO WITH THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG ADDICTION AT THE AND IN ALL THE PROBLEMS OF COURSE SOME MIGHT -- BUT THAT THE NEXT HOUSE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK OUT SPEAK ABOUT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE CRIMES IN THE COMPLAINTS IN THE COMMUNITY -- WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE AN END TO THAT UNLESS WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY LOCALLY -- THIS THIS ISSUE FIXED BY ALLOWING PEOPLE WHEN THEY GO TO JAIL UPON BOOKING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TAKING THEIR DRUGS -- INCLUDING PEOPLE NORTH AND WORSE OR SOMETIMES A PRESCRIBED METHADONE -- WHICH IS ANOTHER DRUG USED AND AND MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT THEN ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING PEOPLE TO DO AND I'VE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE IS THERE ON THE STREETS AND THEY'RE TOLD A MILLION TIMES BY YOU KNOW THE OUTREACH WORKERS YOU NEED TO GET HELP WITH YOUR DICTION NEED TO START HELPING YOURSELF YOU NEED TO GET OFF THE STREETS YOU NEED IT YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH YOUR DRUG ADDICTION SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GO TO A METHADONE CLINIC OR THEY GO TO YOU KNOW SUBOXONE CLINIC AND THEY GET ON METHADONE TO GET ON SUBOXONE THEN WHAT HAPPENS THEY GET PICKED UP BY THE POLICE FOR VIOLATING ANY KIND OF YOU KNOW STATUS CHORUS ANY ANY KIND OF YOU KNOW CRIME ASSOCIATE WITH BEING HOMELESS HAPPENS ALL TOO OFTEN THEY GO TO JAIL THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THERE AREN'T THEY'RE TAKING THEIR TREATMENTS RIGHT BUT WHEN THEY GO TO THE JAILS THEY'RE TOLD WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR METHOD ON ROCKETING GIVE YOU YOUR SUBOXONE WE DON'T DO THAT SO THE SAUDI DO INSTEAD IS THEY GIVE YOU A DRUG TO DRINK TO ESSENTIALLY TRANSITION YOU OFF OF THAT TO GET YOU OFF OF METHADONE STATE GIVE YOU VARIOUS DRUGS LIKE YOU KNOW ASPIRIN OR DRUGS FOR A CERTAIN DRUGS FOR YEAR YOU FOR THE VARIOUS SIDE EFFECTS OF OF OPIATE WITHDRAWALS LIKE PAIN EXTREME DISCOMFORT ARM AND SO YOU'RE SO THEY'RE TREATING THE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH OPIATE WITHDRAWALS IN THE JAILS BUT THAT'S POINTLESS BECAUSE WHEN THEY GET RELEASE FROM THE JAILS EITHER GOING TO RELAPSE BACK ONTO OPIATES OR THEY'RE GONNA GO RIGHT BACK TO WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING WHICH IS GETTING ON MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO STOP AND CURRENTLY IN ORDER AND IN JAILS IN ORANGE COUNTY -- WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE PREGNANT AND ON METHADONE SHOULD BE CONTINUED ON THE METHADONE TREATMENT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO PUT THEIR FETUSES INTO WITHDRAWAL AND ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE -- TO -- TO MISCARRY SO WOMEN FOR PREGNANT ARE ACTUALLY IMMEDIATELY UPON BOOKING ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TAKING METHADONE HOWEVER THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH EVERY OTHER IN THE UPON BOOKING SO THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE LOCALLY AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE STATEWIDE AND SO I DID HAVE SO I BASICALLY DID HAVE A MEMORANDUM THAT I PRINT THAT I -- THAT I LAID OUT ALL THESE ISSUES A RECENT YOU KNOW CASE WHERE -- IN THE FIRST CIRCUIT THE FEDERAL -- THE FEDERAL AT FIVE FOR CIRCUIT COURT SAID THAT THIS ESSENTIALLY BY THE TEAM OR BECAUSE DISABILITIES ACT TO TO DISCREETLY P. TREAT PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT DISORDERS THIS WAY AND ARE IN IN JAILS THAT'S ALONG THE FIRST CIRCUIT THAT LOT THAT CASE ERRORS DUKE -- AIRS THE HEIRS TO COUNTY CASE SMITH RETURNS TO COUNTY THAT NEEDS TO BE CODIFIED LOCALLY THERE NEEDS TO BE LEGISLATION PASSED IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT NEEDS TO THAT SO THAT NEEDS TO BE CODIFIED STATEWIDE AND THE NEEDS TO BE FIXED LOCALLY AS WELL OKAY SO THANK YOU FOR THAT WHOLE FOR DISCUSSION I THINK OF THAT MANY OF US MAY NOT HAVE EVEN BEEN AWARE OF OR UNDERSTAND STOOD THE CAPACITY AND YOUR -- EFFORT IN THAT AREA JUST SO YOU KNOW WE WILL HAVE THESE PRESENTATIONS AVAILABLE BY EMAIL IF YOU LET US KNOW SO WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND SEE IF THE PANEL HAS ANY QUESTIONS FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER YES THANK YOU SEE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT MEDICAID MEDICAID AS MEDICATIONS TO TREATMENT YOUR SPECIFICALLY SPEAKING ABOUT IT WILL BE IT WILL BE ABLE TO DO WE HAVE SIMILAR TREATMENT FOR OTHER DRUGS THAT ARE OUT THERE THIS IS NOT THE ONLY THING PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED TO YEAH I MEAN SO I MEAN A LOT OF THE ADVOCATES ARE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE CAN TELL YOU THAT OPIATES ARE BIG ONE AND MATH IS ALSO ANOTHER BIG ONE -- ESSENTIALLY IT'S ARE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE TO GET YOUR HANDS ON -- THAN MATH SO IF YOU HAVE LIKE A MATH PROBLEM IF YOU'RE SPENDING TEN BUCKS A DAY TRYING TO FUEL YOUR METHOD ACTION WITH OPIATES IT'S CLOSER TO YOU BY THE TIME YOU'RE SHOOTING UP MAYBE SEVENTY EIGHTY DOLLARS A DAY I'M SO THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE ABLE TO KIND OF SUSTAIN THAT HABIT IS BY STEALING ARM BY SELLING -- SO SO ALL SO I MEAN I WOULD SAY THAT THEIR THEIR PRODUCT I MEAN THERE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY TREATMENTS FOR MATH ADDICTION AS WELL -- IT'S A LOT HARDER TO OVERDOSE ON MATH AND IT IS TO OVERDOSE ON OPIATES OPIATES -- OPIATES ARE OFTEN LACED WITH -- -- WITH FAT NOW WHICH IS A SYNTHETIC OPIATE ARM WHICH IN VERY VERY VERY MINUTE JOE SAYS I'M COULD EASILY KILL YOU I'M UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE SEEING FAT NOW BEING LOCATED IN OTHER DRUGS AS WELL -- AND SO IN TERMS OF THE IN TERMS OF THE IN THAT THE OF THE FATALITIES CAUSED BY DIFFERENT DRUGS I THINK THAT MORE PEOPLE DIE IT WILL BE IT'S PROBABLY MOST I MEAN PROBABLY A GREATER NUMBER DIVE -- ALCOHOL ADDICTION AS WELL SO SO SO THERE NEEDS TO THEIR NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW MORE TREATMENT OBVIOUSLY FOR ALL THESE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES BY THE REASON WHY I FOCUS ON OPIATES IS BECAUSE ONE ARM THE THE THE THE THE FATALITY RATES CAUSED BY OPIATES ARM TO ARM THE OF THE BUT THAT THE WAY THAT IT COMPLETELY DESTROYS PEOPLE'S LIVES AND RUIN SOME FINANCIALLY AND RUINS OF ECONOMICALLY IS VERY SPECIFIC AND VERY UNIQUE TO OPIATES -- AND THREE WHEN PEOPLE OFTEN USE OPIATES ARM SINCE OPIATES ESSENTIALLY HAVE THIS NARCOTIC THEY HAVE AN ARCATA CA FACT OBVIOUSLY BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE AT A DOWNER DRUG OFTEN PEOPLE WILL USE OPIATES IN CONJUNCTION WITH MATH WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY KIND OF AN UPPER DRUG SO OFTEN TIMES YOU SEE THIS ARM HE IS YOU SEE THIS -- DO WILL OCCURRING LIKE ADDICTION ARE WHERE PEOPLE ARE ARE TAKING BOTH TRUCKS VERY VERY REGULARLY IT'S CALLED SPEED BALLING ESSENTIALLY ARM AND -- AND AND SO I I THINK THAT -- OPIATES ARE OFTEN A GATEWAY INTO I'M ESSENTIALLY WORSE AND WORSE ARM USE ARM WHEN PEOPLE GO FROM SMOKING TO SHOOTING UP OPIATES THERE THE ADDICTIONS GET EXPONENTIALLY WORSE IN TERMS OF -- EIGHT HOW MUCH SHE HOW MUCH IS ACTUALLY IT IS THAT YOU'RE SPENDING IN ORDER SHOULD UP VERSES WHEN YOUR HABIT IS BASICALLY JUST SMOKING BY BLACK TAR HEROIN ARM AND BE LIKE THE THE THE LEVELS OF LIKE COMPLICATIONS ARM FROM SHOOTING APPARENTLY I'VE FROM SHOOTING UP HEROIN SO ESSENTIALLY LIKE OPIATES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND IT'S BUT WITH ONE OF THE HARDEST IT'S ONE THE HARDEST TO BE ABLE TO -- TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME ANOTHER ANOTHER FACT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY I MEAN YOU DON'T REALLY DIE FROM MASS WITHDRAWAL YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN WITHDRAW CAN DIE FROM HEROIN WITHDRAWAL BECAUSE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF LIKE THE VOMITING ARMS THE DIARRHEA THE HYDRATION AT THAT CAN COME FROM THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN'T DIE FROM THE AT THE WITHDRAWALS ARE ALSO ALL VERY EXTREMELY SEVERE WHEN IT COMES TO IT I'M VERSUS OTHER DRUGS BUT HEROIN IS NOT AN OPIATE OR NOT ANOTHER ONE IS AN OPIATE YES KAREN IS AN OPIATE -- AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE YOU KNOW PHARMACEUTICALS METHADONE ALL OF THESE ARE OPIATES THEY THEY THEY WORK IN THAT SAME WAY -- BUT YEAH SO WE NEED IF WE NEED TO GET A LOOK AT MEDICATIONS AS A TREATMENT FOR TREATING -- OPIATE ADDICTION SO REMEMBER THAT LAST QUESTION VERY TIED TO THE SO SO YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT RECOMMEND THAT WE DO YOU MEDIC MEDICATION IS THE TREATMENT THAT WE DON'T YOU TALKED ABOUT STEVE I LEGISLATION THAT YOU ARE PROPOSING YEAH AND YOUR FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT OPIATES AND NOT JUST MEDICATED ASSISTED TREATMENT IN GENERAL WHAT MADE IT MEDICATIONS THAT THE TREATMENT IS KIND OF A TERM OF ART T. ARM THAT'S THAT IS TO DESCRIBE THIS VERY SPECIFIC MEDICAL INTERVENTION -- FOR OPIATES I THINK THE EASIEST WAY TO CONCEPTUALIZE A POTENTIAL STATE BILL ON THIS ISSUE IS TO CODIFY THE HOLDING IN SMITH V. ARISTIDE COUNTY AN DO WE HAVE DATE OF BEING OF LET'S FIRST I CAN ACCEPT YOUR PREMISE THAT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS WHAT'S GIVING THE STIGMA TO THIS LARGER POPULATION SURE ARE AND AMONG SAID TWENTY PERCENT DO WE HAVE DATE OF HOW MUCH OF ITS OPIATE VERSUS MATH AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE YET SO -- THIS IS A VERY VERY COMPLEX ISSUE TO TRY TO EXPLAIN AND SO I I TRY TO RUN TO AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT I DID PREPARE -- ABOUT A FIFTY PAGE MEMO -- THAT I THINK CAN BE SENT OUT TO -- TO ANYBODY UPON REQUEST THANK YOU THANK YOU WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER DATE YES -- CAN I CALL SOMEBODY FOR MURDER THE HEALTHCARE AGENCY TO ANSWER ABOUT THIS BUT THIS PROGRAM ABOUT MEDICAL ASSISTANT THE TREATMENT WELL WE HAVE COMING TO THE MIKE CARE OR YOU CAN SIT RIGHT THERE -- THIS IS RICHARD SANCHEZ FROM THE COUNTY BUT THE MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT SO SO SO WITH THE SANCHES HER DESK ORANGE COUNTY CURRENTLY OFFER THIS PROGRAM TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TEMPORARY DETAIN -- WHEN WHEN WHEN THEY HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM WE GIVE THEM ANYTHING AT ALL TO -- TREAT THEIR PROBLEM SO FOR A CAR ST INDIVIDUALS WE DO PROVIDE AS MISTRAL HE SAID -- PREGNANT WOMEN AND AB ONE OH NINE INMATES SUBOXONE AND NALOXONE -- EXCUSE ME THE PROVEN ARE FITTING AND STOP AND AND NALOXONE WE ARE WORKING ON PROVIDING THE OTHER TRACKS BOX ON AS WELL AND WE ARE EXPANDING MAPPED MEDICARE SYSTEM TREATMENT TWELVE INMATES AS WELL DO YOU NEED THE STATE LEGISLATION TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM OR LANDING WOULD YOU HELPFUL MORE IS A MORE IT IS MORE OF A FUNDING ISSUE THIS AND THE AND THE LEGAL ISSUES AS YOU MAY KNOW -- MEDI CAL -- SUSPENDED WHILE INCARCERATED SO FAR ALL FUNDING FOR TREATMENT INSIDE THE JAIL IS IS WE HAVE TO FIND FUNDING FOR OTHER THAN MEDI CAL THAT WE CANNOT USE ANY MEDI CAL NOR MHSAA NOR ANY SUBSTANCE USE DOLLARS WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED SO THE STRUGGLES ALWAYS BEEN FUNDING THANK YOU IS THERE ANY LCD LIKE TO ADD TO A A LOT OF THE A. T. IS SOMEWHAT NHIÁU -- MEDICAID ASSISTED TREATMENT -- WE HAVE FOUND THAT TO BE VERY USEFUL WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT RE ENTRY SO -- AGAIN AS THE SPEAKER SAID THEY ENTER WITH A DRUG ADDICTION WE ARE EXPANDING OUR AS YOU AS THE THIS GROUP MAY NOW WE ARE EXPANDING OUR SERVICES INSIDE THE JAIL IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE AND SO WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT RE ENTRY SO WHEN THE PERSON HITS THE STREETS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR -- WELL EQUIPPED WITH MEDICATION TO TIE THEM FOR PERIOD UNTIL THEY GET THEIR -- EITHER MEDI CAL OR OTHER INSURANCE COVERAGE SO THEY DON'T RELAPSE THANK YOU SO THIS I THINK IS WHERE WE GET INTO THE COMPLEXITIES OF WHO IS ON OUR STREETS WHO IS THE MOST VULNERABLE IN THE SENSE OF BEING REALLY CLOSE TO DEATH BECAUSE IF YOU'VE INTERFACED WITH ANYBODY WHO HAS -- THESE ADDICTIONS A OR A STEP AWAY FROM DEATH AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED ABOUT ALCOHOLISM SO -- ADDICTIONS DO PLAY A ROLE I THINK WHAT YOU STARTED WITH THOUGH IS THE STIGMA THE STIGMA THAT'S ATTACHED TO WHETHER IT BE A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE WHICH WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY OF OUR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHO DO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY CAN HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND ADDICTION ISSUES AND MANY OTHER ISSUES TO COP COMPOUND -- WHAT TERRY ARE SUFFERING ON THE STREETS INCLUDING HEALTH ISSUES -- SO YOU MAY HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE -- NOT ONLY ADDICTION ISSUES MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ISSUE AND THAT WOULD BE -- AS SOME OF THE OF NO I DON'T LIKE TO DO IT OFTEN BUT I WILL IN THE SENSE THAT WOULD BE MY BROTHER BILLY AND HE -- STARTED OUT AS A VERY STRONG HARD WORKING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT COME WITH WHAT YOU WOULD WANT TO SEE ANY OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS BUT THROUGH INTERFACE SCENE WITH A ALCOHOLISM AND WITH THE ALCOHOLISM AND WITH GETTING OLDER AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THAT HE SUFFERED FROM HERNIA THAT WAS NOT TREATED BECAUSE WE COULDN'T GET HIM TO GET TO -- ACTUALLY MAKE THE APPOINTMENTS AND MANY TIMES THESE APPOINTMENTS ARE NOT ALL IN THE SAME PLACE SO I JUST PUT A FACE TO THIS BECAUSE THIS ADDICTION AND HOMELESSNESS IS NOT A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT ISSUE IT IS NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE AND IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THEM IT DOESN'T CHIU SOMEBODY BY ECONOMICS SO WE COULDN'T SAY THAT IT'S ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS AREA OR ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS AREA THE IT DOESN'T TO PICK BY YOUR SOCIAL ECONOMICS OR YOUR COLLEGE DEGREE IT AFFECTS MANY IN EVERY FAMILY IN SOME WAYS THAT MOST OF US ARE DON'T WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT AND THAT'S THE STIGMA AND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AT THE LAST HEARING ON SOBRE WHICH IS THAT IF SOMEBODY COMES IN AND THEY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER WE IMMEDIATELY RALLY AROUND THEM LET'S GET MEALS LET'S GET OUR FACEBOOK FRIENDS TO DELIVER MALES LET'S YOU KNOW WOULD DO PRAYER GROUPS IS DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT HIM SOMEBODY STARTS HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR ADDICTION ISSUES EVERYTHING BECOMES REALLY QUIET AND WILL WHISPER THAT WHEN I TALKED ABOUT MY BROTHER'S BILLY STORES I HAD ALMOST A THOUSAND TEXT MESSAGES AND EMAILS ALL WITH THE SAME NARRATIVE YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T REALLY TOLD ANYBODY ABOUT IT BUT MY BROTHER SUFFERS FROM THIS OR WE'VE BEEN DEALING AND THIS IS FAMILY SUFFERING IN SILENCE AND THEN PRETTY MUCH THIS FAMILY ISN'T THERE ANYMORE BECAUSE MAYBE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T DO ANYMORE THEY LET GO AND THAT IS MANY TIMES WHERE YOU SAY WELL HOW DOES A SENIOR HAVE NO SAFETY NET HOW DOES SOMEBODY WHO HAVE GRANDCHILDREN OR ANSWER ON GOALS HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN AND THE TRUTH IS AT SOME POINT PEOPLE JUST LET GO SO WITH THAT WILL MOVE TO OUR THANK YOU AND WILL MOVE TO OUR CHIEF CHIEF COREY SINUS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CROOKS OVER IP SHAPE BEING HERE TODAY -- MONITOR SPEAK ON BEHALF OF -- NORTH ON CARILLON FORSMAN -- I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHEN A PARK AND WE'RE GOING TO PARK IS DOING AND THEN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE REGIONAL THINGS WE'RE DOING IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY OUR WAS BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IS WHEN -- WE REALLY STARTED TO FEEL THE IMPACT OF HOMELESS NURSE IN OUR COMMUNITY OF THE COMMUNITY REGARDING THE HOMELESS WERE ON THE RISE AND OUR CALLS FOR SERVICE -- INVOLVING HOMELESS ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL CALLS FOR SERVICE IT WAS BECOMING A HUGE GRIN ON SOURCES AND IT WASN'T GETTING ANY BETTER WE STARTED TO HAVE SOME SOME SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS WITH CITY COUNCIL REGARDING A HOMELESS ISSUES WE ALL REALIZE THAT WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR MINDSET AN ATTITUDE ABOUT THE HOMELESS BECAUSE WHAT WE WERE DOING WHICH WAS MOSTLY ENFORCEMENT AT THAT TIME WASN'T SOLVING THE PROBLEM WE HAD TO BECOME MORE PROACTIVE AND WE KNEW THAT WE WEREN'T DOING ANY LONG TERM PROBLEM SOLVING WE WERE JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD THEN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OUR CITY COUNCIL HIRED A CONSULTANT TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO -- ARE HOMELESS ISSUES AND MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE COULD BETTER SERVE THAT OUR POPULATION TWO OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WERE IMPLEMENTED WERE TO CONTRACT WITH THE NONPROFIT THAT COULD HELP US -- WITH HOMELESS OUTREACH WE SERVICE SUBSEQUENTLY CONTRACTED WITH CITY NET AND TO -- HIGHER AND TWO ADDITIONAL FULL TIME POLICE OFFICERS AS HOMELESS LIAISON OFFICERS TO WORK WITH CITY THAT AND TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN STRONG RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ALL HOMELESS POPULATION WE STARTED TO SEE THE CHANGES ARE IN THE WAY WE DID BUSINESS WHEN IT CAME TO ADDRESS AND ALL HOMELESS ISSUES WE'RE BECOMING PROACTIVE AND WE'RE NOW FOCUSING ON REDUCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE CITY AND THE REGION BY FUNDING FIND A LONG TERM SOLUTION SUCH A SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THROUGHOUT REACH COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND MULTI DISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION WE ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS JUST NOT A WHEN A PARK ISSUE IT WAS A REGIONAL ISSUE IN ADDITION WE STARTED BUILDING STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE COUNTY WITH ORANGE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH IT WAS SHELVE SEVERAL NONPROFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BRING AS MANY AVAILABLE RESOURCES TOGETHER FOR THIS MULTI DISCIPLINARY APPROACH IN AND DEAN -- SHORT TERM AND CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE WE WERE BECOMING MORE PROACTIVE IN GOING TO SPEND MORE TIME ON LONG TERM SOLUTIONS WE PROVIDE PROVIDED WE ARE A CELLO IS IN ALL OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO ASSIST THEM IN CONNECTING WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION ALL OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ATTENDED A SIXTEEN HOUR CRISIS INTERVENTION

PERCENT WERE VETERANS AND FORTY PERCENT HAD THEIR LAST PERMANENT RESIDENCY OUTSIDE OF NORTH ORANGE COUNTY ALL OF THIS DATA WAS EXTREMELY CRITICAL AS A TASK FORCE TRYING TO DETERMINE THE GRAVITY OF THE ISSUE AND THE TYPES OF RESOURCES AND SERVICES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD ALL OF THIS INFORMATION WAS ALSO ENTERED INTO A BY NAME DATABASE FOR OUR OUTREACH TEAMS FOR IMMEDIATE ACCESS IN THE FIELD AND IN AN EFFORT TO HAVE REAL TIME INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE TO OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND NOW REACH MEMBERS WE ALSO PARTNER WITH THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY BY THE NAME OF OUTREACH GRID THEY DEVELOPED AN APPLICATION TO USE OUR OFFICERS CELL PHONES IN ADDITION WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH THE HOMELESS SHELTERS TO DEVELOP AN AVAILABLE BED APPLICATION SO THAT OUR OFFICERS CAN SEE WHAT BEDS ARE AVAILABLE WHEN THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH INDIVIDUALS IN THE FIELD IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE CITY ONE APART PARTY WITH OTHER NORTH COUNTY SPA CITIES AND THE COUNTY OF ORANGE TO REGIONALLY FIND TO NAVIGATION CENTERS ONE OF PLACENTIA AND HERE IN THE CITY OF ONE OF PARK THE HOMELESS NAVIGATION CENTER IN ONE OF PARK IS EXPECTED TO OPEN SOMETIME AROUND JUNE OF THIS YEAR UP NEXT YEAR WHY DO WE NEED SHELTER BEDS WE NEED THEM AS A TOOL TO HELP US PROVIDE HOUSING AND SERVICES DRAW HOMELESS NEIGHBORS AND TO GET OUR TOOLS BACK SO WE DON'T HAVE THE HOMELESS CAMPS IN OUR PARKS AND STREETS OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN FEEL SAFE AGAIN AND WE DON'T HAVE THE PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH THESE TYPES OF ISSUES WITHOUT AVAILABLE BEDS WERE ALSO UNABLE TO ENFORCE OUR CAMPING AND ORDERING ORDINANCE AS IT WAS ALSO MOVIES WE SOME LAWSUITS AND THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY SO THE BOTTOM LINE FOR A MOMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE AND FROM A CITY PERSPECTIVE IS AT I THINK I AM GOING TO QUOTE OUR CITY MANAGER HERE WE SAYS ONE OF PARK IS IN THE HOMELESS BUSINESS BECAUSE WE ARE AND WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH OTHER CITIES AND THE COUNTY TO DO ALL WE CAN TO HELP HOMELESS HOMELESS NEIGHBORS PROVIDE THEM WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO GET THEM INTO HOUSING AND OFF THE STREET WE'RE TRULY TO HELP AND HOMELESSNESS WE NEED TO CONTINUE OUR REGIONAL EFFORTS AS WE'RE DOING WITH THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY TASK FORCE WHICH HAS HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND I WOULD HAVE I WILL PROVIDE ANYBODY THAT WANTS A COPY OF OUR OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT AND OUR SENSES REPORT IT'LL BE IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM YOU'RE WELCOME TO TAKE A COPY OF IT REALLY WE NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED A PLACE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO GO BEYOND THE SHELTER BECAUSE ALL WE'RE DOING IS OPENING A REVOLVING DOOR FOR THEM AND SO UNTIL WE GET THE HOUSING IN PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE A PLACE TO GO AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE MUCH OF A DOWN THIS CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU MISTER UP POLICE CHIEF COREY SINUS AND I CAN TELL YOU JUST FROM SERVING IN AND REPRESENTING THIS AREA FOR FIVE YEARS HE DOES WHAT HE SAYS ANY IS OUT THERE AND THIS IS A NOT ABOUT PUSHING PEOPLE FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER IT'S ABOUT BUILT BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS AND LOOKING AT THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE SOMEBODY FROM HOMELESSNESS TO HOME ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE MOVED TO YES THANK YOU CHIEF CHIEF YOU WALK ME THROUGH TO SAID A FEW SCENARIOS SO THAT THE PUBLIC IN AND MAYBE THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY CAN CAN ME -- IT'S LIKE SO FIRST NERIO YOUR YOUR FRONTLINE OFFICER GET A CALL THAT SOMEONE IS CAMPING OUT AT THE PARK YOUR OFFICE SHOW UP IT'S A FAMILY YOU COULD BE A FAMILY COULD BE A MOM WITH HER CHILDREN WHAT DOES THAT OFFICERS SAY TO TO THEM I AM AND WHAT KIND OF SERVICE CAN YOU OFFICER ORDER OR YOUR TASK FORCE OFFER IN IN IN DEALING WITH A FAMILY THAT'S DOWN ON ON THEIR LUCK SO -- WE DO SPEND SOME QUALITY TIME WITH THEM NOW VERSUS WHAT WE DID YEARS AGO AND THAT IS HAVING SOME CONVERSATION WITH THEM REGARDING THEIR NEEDS COM YOU KNOW THE SOME PAST HISTORY WHERE THEY'VE BEEN PROVIDED AS FAR SERVICES AND A WHAT IS IT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CAN WE WE KIND CONNECTION WITH YOUR FAMILIES -- AND AND NOW OTHER OFFICERS ARE NOW EQUIPPED WITH WITH INFORMATION ON RESOURCES AVAILABLE WILL EIGHT WERE ABLE TO HELP CONNECT THEM WITH THE RESOURCES TO GET THEM MAYBE INTO A INTO SOME FORM HOUSING AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT FAMILIES AND WOMEN GET FIRST PRIORITY -- YOU KNOW THOSE ARE FIRST PARTY GET THEM OFF THE STREET AND THERE ARE USUALLY PLACES WHERE THEY CAN GO IF THEY WANT TO -- WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT APPROXIMATELY FORTY PERCENT OF THE HOMELESS DO NOT WANT ASSISTANCE SIXTY PERCENT AROUND SIXTY PERCENT DO AND IF THEY WANT TO HOUSING USUALLY WE CAN FIND A PLACE FOR THEM TO GO SO FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT THE ASSISTANCE LIKE LIKE YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU KNOW YOUR OFFICER COMES UP TO THEM AND SAID HEY -- WE WE HAVE SOME MOTEL VOUCHER FOR YOU TO STAY FOR A COUPLE WEEKS VERY OR WE WE KNOW THAT THESE SHELTER BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO HOME HI HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE NEIGHBORS DON'T WANT THEM CORRECT TO BE AT A PARK OR TO BE SLEEPING IN AN ALLEY OR OR ON A SIDEWALK IT WAS YEAH IT WASN'T A PROBLEM FOR US BECAUSE YOU KNOW ALL GIVEN EXAMPLE MISTY WHEN YOU HAVE LIKE A LITTLE LEAGUE GOING ON IN A PARK AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THIS PERCEPTION OF HOMELESS -- THEY DON'T WANT THEM ANYWHERE NEAR THEIR KIDS IN THEIR CHILDREN -- YOU KNOW WE DO ALL WE CAN TO KIND OF RELATE THAT INFORMATION TO THAT HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL A TO SEE IF MAYBE WE CAN HELP THEM AND AND MAYBE MOVE THEM TO ANOTHER LOCATION -- BUT OFTEN TIMES THEY DON'T WANT TO GO AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE IN THAT PART JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE DOES SO THERE'S NOT THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO AS FAR AS ENFORCEMENT WE TRY TO DO WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND ENTICE THEM TO MOVE ON TO ANOTHER LOCATION IF THEY DON'T WANT ANY ASSISTANCE WHETHER THAT BE WITH SOME FOOD OUT YOURS OR SOME MOTEL VOUCHERS OR THINGS OF THAT NATURE BUT IF THEY DON'T WANT TO GO THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE IN THAT PART JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE SO SO THAT WOULD BE ONE SEGMENT OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION THAT WE THAT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION YET RIGHT CORRECT AND I WILL I WILL ASSURE YOU THAT OUR OFFICERS OF FIRST RESPONDERS KNOW THESE INDIVIDUALS THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS THEY WERE THERE THE CALLS FOR SERVICE AND WE GET ON A REGULAR BASIS AND AND WE KNOW THEM ON A FIRST NAME BASIS -- AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE KNOW WHERE THEY LIKE TO STAY WITH A LIKE TO EAT THAT KIND OF STUFF AND SO WE HELP PROVIDE THEM WITH SOME SOME ASSISTANCE WE CAN OPERATE YOU GET YOUR OFFICER YET GET A CALL YOU SHOW UP A. N. DE THE PERSON OR THE GROUPS BAD -- TRIGGER THAT THOSE CALLS WHERE THE THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO LEASE OF STABLE ANYMORE A IN HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND THEY'RE THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE THEY'RE CAUSING A DISTURBANCE WHEN YOU GET TO THE LIKE WHAT IS WHAT IS YOUR SOLUTION TO AT LEAST ABATE THAT PROBLEM ON THAT DAY OR THAT WEEK WELL IF IF THIRD -- YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL FIFTY ONE FIFTY AFTER DANGER THEMSELVES A DANGER TO OTHERS OR R. OR I GAVE THE DISABLED ARE OFFICERS CAN TAKE THEM TO A TREATMENT CENTER -- WHICH AND IN THE END I MENTION THIS IN MY IN MY ORIGINAL COMMENTS ABOUT US HAVING A OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM -- WE'RE WE HAVE SOMEBODY FROM MENTAL HEALTH AGENCY THAT USUALLY RIDE WITH OUR HELOC OF SOMEBODY THAT'S MORE -- MORE HAS MORE EXPERTISE IN THAT AREA THEY CAN HELP US SEE EVALUATE THEM AND BE ABLE TO HOPEFULLY FIND THEM A BAD TAKE THAT THEY CAN GO TO AND GET THEM THE MEDICATION WITH THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED TO WILL WHERE WITH THAT TREATMENT CENTER BE AN ORANGE COUNTY ARE YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE NAMES OF THEM ALL AT HONESTLY BUT -- THERE'S A MULTIPLE LOT OF TIMES THEY MIGHT GO TO THE HOSPITAL FIRST ON IT AND I BELIEVE SOMEBODY MENTIONED OVERWHELMED WITH PATIENTS -- THAT ARE YOU THE MENTALLY ILL OR OR A -- NEED TREATMENT -- A LOT OF TIMES THEY THEY WILL GO TO THE HOSPITAL FIRST AND THEN WE CALL A PSYCHOLOGICAL TEAM HOW TO THE HOSPITAL THE TO DO AN EVALUATION THEY ARE CUTTING DROPPING THEM OFF AT THE E. R. ROOM IS -- IS COSTLY IT IS VERY COSTLY YES AND THAT'S A THAT'S A MAJORITY OF WHAT WE HAVE TO GET A MEDICALLY CLEARED FIRST CHIEF AYE AYE I ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS TO RELEASE ARM HAVE HAVE THIS OPEN DISCUSSION ABOUT -- HOMELESSNESS IN IN A SENSE WHERE OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS NOT ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE WHO WANTS HELP RIGHT OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE AT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS ABOUT HOW DO WE DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WANT TO HELP BUT HAVE CERTAIN CIVIL RIGHTS WHERE YOU CANNOT TAKEN TO A EIGHTY EIGHTY EIGHT CENTER OR EVEN A TREATMENT CENTER AGAINST THEIR WILL AND THEN HOW DO WE DO WITH THAT POPULATION IF THAT IS NOT THE TWENTY PERCENT THAT IS ON THE THE ADDITION -- CATEGORY WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT JUST REFUSE HELP WANTS TO BE ON THE SIDEWALK LIKE TO LIVE IN A TENT IN THE BACK OF AN ALLEY AND THAT BASS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR CONSTITUENT REALLY WANT US TO ADDRESS TO BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THEY SEE WHEN THEY DRIVE ACROSS THE -- THE FREEWAY WHEN THE WHEN THE DRIVE TO THE STREET THAT'S WHAT THEY ALLEGE THE SOUL RIGHT IBM I I HOPE THAT YOU CAN GIVE US SOME SOME IDEAS ON HOW WE DEAL WITH WITH THAT SEGMENT OF THE OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION BECAUSE THEY ITS MULTI FAST RIGHT IT IS AND THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU KNOW AND AND AND A LOT OF TIMES -- THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO FOR THEM -- IF THEY DON'T WANNA HELP AND SO -- THAT'S YOU KNOW WE DO ALL WE CAN TO ADDRESS -- IT FROM AN ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE AND IN SOME CASES -- BECAUSE -- THAT'S OUR ONLY ALTERNATIVE OTHER THAN OFFERING THEM SERVICES THEY DON'T WANT IT IS AND THEN WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY OBEY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES OF THE CITY AS LONG AS THEY DO THAT HOW WE HONESTLY IT'S JUST TOO IT'S TOO TIME CONSUMING FOR OFFICERS AND SO WE HAVE TO MOVE ON TO BE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER BRIDGES CALLS AND SHE VALUE THE LAST COMMENT I KNOW WE'RE WE'RE RUNNING LOW ON TIME BUT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE TREATMENT CENTER I ASK YOU NOT TO TO TRY TO STOP YOU BECAUSE OP I DON'T KNOW IF WE EVEN HAVE A A DESIGNATED TREATMENT CENTER IN ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OR IN NORTH COUNTY WHERE -- YOU OFFICER OTHER POLICE OFFICER IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE COUNTY NO LIKE HEY IF IF THERE IS A FIFTY ONE FIFTY CASE AND AND THAT PERSON IS A PUBLIC DISTURBANCE IT'S A DANGER TO HIMSELF AND OTHER PEOPLE LIKE YOU OFFICER KNOW WHERE TO TAKE THE PERSON RIGHT RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE SUCH A TREATMENT CENTER AND THEN THE OUR ROOMS YEAH THERE'S VERY FEW BEDS AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT AS PART OF THE TASK FORCE A BUNCH OF US WENT TO PHOENIX ARIZONA AND TOOK A LOOK AT THEIR TO ONE ONE SYSTEM AND IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET I WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU -- THAT IS A WRAPAROUND SYSTEM THAT YOU CAN GET THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THEY HAVE A RAPID RESPONSE TEAM THAT WILL RESPOND OUT TO THAT CALL FOR SERVICE AND TAKE THAT INDIVIDUAL OFF THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER CREE CAN CLEAR TO GO TO OTHER CALLS IT'S IT'S A PHENOMENAL SYSTEM AND IT AND IT'S PAID FOR VIA THEIR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM -- AND IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO EVENTUALLY SEE HAPPEN HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY A SIMILAR TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ORANGE IS A TOPIC THAT'S IT'S NOT BEEN TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH AND BEEN ON YOU KNOW AS FAR AS PROVIDING FUNDING TO ADDRESS IT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM THANK YOU TO THEM THANK YOU CHIEF YOU SAID THAT BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE YOUR ESTIMATE AS THE SERVICE REYES THIS TIME POPULATION IS THAT IT'S FORTY PERCENT OF THE FOLKS THINK IT'S ABOUT THAT WHEN ACT WHAT'S THE RANGE OF REASONS THAT PEOPLE ARE SERVICE RESISTANT YOU KNOW I I I THINK A LOT -- JUST TELL LIKE DON'T MIND BEING ALMOST DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH FOLLOWING RULES AND NOT BEING ABLE TO DRINK ALCOHOL AND NOT BEING ABLE USE DRUGS AND -- THEY JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE AND AND TO THEMSELVES THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD FOR THEM AND COMMUNITIES THAT PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE EATEN BOTHER THEM WITH THEIR NOT VIOLATING THE LAWS AND I COULD JUST ENJOY THAT TYPE OF LIFE ANDERSON ON THANK YOU ALSO FOR MAKING AB IN MAKING THE POINT ABOUT JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO BUILD A SYSTEM OF CARE AROUND MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HERE IN OUR COUNTY AND ALL ACROSS THE STATE THAT IS FAILING CAN MIGRATE I THINK WE'RE TAKING SOME GOOD STEPS HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY WITH THE GROUND BREAKING UP THE WELL TO START TO CLOSE THAT GAP IT IT IS A YAWNING GAP RIGHT NOW AND A BIG PART OF THAT A BIG PART OF THE CHALLENGER FACING ITS CATCH UP YEAH ABSOLUTELY THANKS THANKS THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO THIS GROUP OF PANELISTS THAT -- FOCUSED ON STRATEGIES WE'VE I THINK HEARD QUITE A BIT JUST IN THIS FIRST PANEL SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT TO SECOND WITH OUR OF A CITY MANAGER WHO IS GOING TO MAKE A REAL QUICK COMMENT THEN WILL DO LITTLE FIVE MINUTE BREAK BECAUSE AGAIN I'M ONE OF THOSE CLASSROOM TEACHERS THAT KNOW THAT AFTER A POINT IF YOU DON'T MOVE YOU'RE GONNA START LOSING INTEREST -- BUT THIS IS CITY MANAGER THEM -- JIM VANDERPOOL THAT IS A PARTNER HERE WOULD NOT ONLY INVITE APART BUT WITH CHIEF COREY SINUS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THE STEAM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT DIALOGUE -- TO THE PUBLIC ORANGE COUNTY AS A WHOLE -- I WANNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS JUST FROM A CITY PERSPECTIVE UP BEYOND WHAT SHE SIGNED AS A SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE WITH THE PUBLIC -- MORE FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE MAY BE FINANCIAL KIND OF OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE -- AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR YOUR QUESTIONS LARGER CALIFORNIA CITIES -- ARE NOT PREPARED FOR TAKING THE LEAD ROLE IN THIS ISSUE BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY PREPARED TO BE A PARTNER -- WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S REGIONAL ISSUE AND BY CITY -- BASIS OUR CASE ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST EFFECTIVE -- CAN DOWN THE FUNDING OF COURSE -- CITIES WE FILL POTHOLES -- WE KEEP NEIGHBORHOOD SAFE WE PROVIDE PARKS SERVICES WE PROVIDE SENIOR CENTERS ON THE MYRIAD OF IS NOT ONE -- THAT WE -- -- HAVE TRADITIONALLY PROVIDED -- THE CHIEF MENTIONED DIALOGUE THAT WE ENGAGE WITH THE CITY COUNCIL I IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW ARE WE GOING INTO THE HOMELESS BUSINESS AND NOT TO BE YOU KNOW -- -- LIGHT IN ANY CAPACITY BUT IT WAS A POLICY QUESTION FOR THE CITY COUNCIL AND YOU THINK OF THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY CITIES TO MAINTAIN THE SERVICES THAT THEY TRADITIONALLY PROVIDE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ADDING HOMELESSNESS SERVICES TO THAT AND THE EXPENSES RELATED TO THAT IT'S QUITE A BURDEN -- THE STATE LOOK AT -- POSSIBLY REWARDING THOSE CITIES AND THOSE REGIONS THAT ARE WORKING COOPERATIVELY ON TO TAKE THIS ISSUE ON A PRO ACTIVELY AND POSSIBLY INCENTIVIZE OR REWARD THOSE CITIES WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIRECT ALLOCATION IN THE LEGISLATION FROM THIS LAST YEAR FOR THE THIRTEEN LARGEST CITIES JUST OUR NORTH SPOT ALONE REPRESENT ABOUT ALMOST A MILLION PEOPLE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY SO IF THERE'S SOME MECHANISM TO DO A DIRECT ALLOCATION FOR THOSE CITIES AND THOSE REGIONS ARE WORKING COOPERATIVELY TO TO GET FUNDING INCENTIVIZE -- A PROACTIVE MORE PROACTIVE ACTION -- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE CHALLENGED -- WAS SPENDING MORE ON RESPONSES TO HOMELESSNESS NOT EVEN PROVIDING THE SHELTERING AT JUST THE RESPONSE TO THE DILEMMA THAT'S IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS -- POLICE EMERGENCY MEDICAL FIRE PUBLIC WORKS CLEAN UP AND WE CANNOT STOP DOING THOSE SERVICES AND THAT WOULD BE THE FUNDING WE COULD POTENTIALLY PROVIDE TO SHELTERING -- I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON ONE THING THE CHIEF MENTIONED THAT IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING SB TWO WAS REALLY ESTABLISHED AS WE UNDERSTAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE ARE DIVERTING ALMOST A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THOSE FUNDS FOR HOMELESS SHELTER WHICH IS A CRITICAL NEED BUT THE NEED IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN REDEVELOPMENT WAS ABOLISHED AND WE LOST THAT SET ASIDE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT WAS CRITICAL AND IF I CAN MAKE A PAGE TO THE LEGISLATORS IN THIS ROOM AND YOUR COLLEAGUES IN SACRAMENTO TO CONSIDER INCREMENTS FINANCING IN SOME CAPACITY TO BRING BACK CITIES ABILITY TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WOULD BE A PHENOMENAL AND FINALLY -- NORTH ORANGE COUNTY IN THE TWELVE CITIES THAT ARE PART OF THE SPA AND CERTAINLY THE COUNTY OF ORANGE THE CAME UP WITH A REGIONAL SOLUTION OPEN UP TO SHELTERS AND WORK COLLECTIVELY TO FIND NOT ONLY THE CONSTRUCTION BUT ALSO THE OPERATIONS WE ARE HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES IN SACRAMENTO TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO TAKE OUR STORY TO SACRAMENTO TO TAKE THIS -- OUR REGIONAL APPROACH TO HOMELESSNESS AND SOLVING HOMELESSNESS WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU DELIVER THAT MESSAGE WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CITY MANAGER SO AS WE HAVE A SOMBER CONVERSATION WE ALSO HAVE LIGHT TO WHERE WE SEE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN A CRITICAL ISSUE IN EVERY SPONDE IT AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE NOT ONLY A LOCAL ELECTED IS THAT ARE HERE BUT ALSO THE NOR SPA CHRIS WE'D LIKE TO SELL TO THE SOUTH BUT REALLY ALL OF THE COUNTY WHO IS INVESTING THEIR TIME IN THIS SO WITH THAT WILL DO LIKE I'M INSANE THREE MINUTES BECAUSE THAT MEANS IF WE DON'T SAY THREE PEOPLE TAKE TEN SO THREE MINUTES AND THEN WE'LL BE BACK WITH OUR SECOND HALF PANEL NOT A PROBLEM OKAY YEAH HOUSE COMING IN AT THAT ARE CHAMBER IN THE MY DISTRICT ORANGE COUNTY HI YEAH YEAH SOME OF THAT WHEN

WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN EMAIL YOU THE PRESENTATIONS AND IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC EMAIL OR OR QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS -- PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU CONTACT THEIR OFFICES REGARDING SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE OUR SECOND PANEL HERE WE HAVE THE TITLE EVERYONE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY AND I WILL LET THE PANELISTS AND INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AND WE WILL BEGAN WITH A OF FORMER MAYOR PRO TEM OF THE CITY OF SANTA ANA MACHEL MARTINEZ THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND TO THE PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY YOU KNOW RECENTLY I'VE BEEN READING THE BOOK TALKING TO STRANGERS FROM MAX WELL I'M GLAD WELL ANY SAYS WE MISS READ THOSE WE DON'T KNOW I THINK WE AS GOVERNMENT ARE MISREADING EACH OTHER WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS A FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE WHEN WERE DRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND WHY I BEGIN THAT WAY IS THAT I'VE BEEN ON THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS WORKING WITH FEDERAL COURT JUDGE DAVID -- CARTER ON HOMELESSNESS AS A PRO BONO POLICY ADVISER ON WITH CITIES I AM NO LONGER ELECTED BUT WHEN I REALIZE THAT THIS IS NOT A CITY ISSUE THIS IS NOT A STATE ISSUE THIS IS NOT A COUNTY ISSUE IS NOT JUST A FEDERAL ISSUE THIS IS EVERYONE'S ISSUE WE CANNOT SOLVE HOMELESSNESS IF WE FIRST CANNOT COMMUNICATE AND I BELIEVE THAT WE LACKED IN COMMUNICATION FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL IT TOOK A FEDERAL COURT JUDGE TO REMOVE THOUSANDS OF FOLKS FROM THE RIVER BACK FROM OUR CIVIC CENTER MANY OF US FOR MANY YEARS AND MANY OF YOU ARE APPEAR ARE NEW TO THE LEGISLATURE AND I WANT TO COMMEND YOU OFFERS FOR REALLY REALLY NOT THEIR SLEEVES AND REALLY HAVING THIS DIALOGUE HERE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THIS WASN'T HAPPENING IN THE PAST BUT IT TOOK A FEDERAL COURT JUDGE AND YOU ALL TO NOW THIS FIGURE WE'RE NOW FIGURING OUT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE AND IS BUILDING EMERGENCY SHELTERS BUT IS THAT THE BUSINESS IS A CITY SHOULD BE IN IS THE QUESTION THAT WE ALL NEED TO ASK OURSELVES I WANT TO THANK THE STATE FROM MOVING FORWARD AND ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS WITH NEW WITH OF COURSE WITH ADDING YOU -- EMERGENCY REGULATIONS TO ADDRESS A BUILDING THESE EMERGENCY SHELTERS THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU ALL HAVE PROVIDED -- AND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION GOING TO CITIES ABOUT MORE POORLY IT'S GOING TO THE THIRTEEN ON LARGEST CITIES I WOULD ASK AND IMPLORE YOU ALL TO LOOK AT SMALLER CITIES BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE IMPACTED THE MOLES WITH THE LAST RESOURCES CITIES LIKE LA ORANGE AND BIG CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY LIKE ANAHEIM IN SANTA ANA YOU KNOW HAVE MORE RESOURCES THAN A CITY LIKE WHEN A PARK AND SO OR LIKE A CITY LIKE COSTA MESA OR CITY LIKE WESTMINSTER THERE HAVE BEEN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ONE TIME FUNDS TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS FOR SHELTERS IS NOT THE ANSWER AND AT THE STATE LEVEL A LOT OF THESE FUNDS WILL BE ONE TIME FUNDS CITIES CANNOT SUSTAIN THESE NEW SHELTERS WITH ONE TIME MONIES AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE BEEN ADDRESS ADDRESSING AT THE FEDERAL COURT AS CITIES HAVE BEEN A SETTLING POLICE AND FIRE COSTS WERE TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE'RE ADDRESSING THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY THAT IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST COSTS FOR CITIES IS FIRE POLICE SERVICES AGAIN WE ARE ALSO NOT MAXIMIZING THE PUBLIC LAND THAT WE OWN WHETHER IT'S FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL WE SHOULD BE MAXIMIZING JUST BUILDING A EMERGENCY SHELTER ON PUBLIC ON PUBLIC LAND WHETHER IT'S STATE OR LOCAL AND NOT BEING ABLE TO DO INTEGRATED HOUSING OR TAKING PROPERTY LIKE MOTELS OFF THE PROPERTY TAX ROLLS DOES NOT HELP THE CITY AND SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND SOME OF THE OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT CREATED THIS HOMELESS CRISIS THAT I SEE BEFORE US IN THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE COULD HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENT HERE TODAY AND THAT IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PROP THIRTEEN AND ALSO SB FIFTY ONE FIFTY FOUR AND AB EIGHT WHICH IS THE PROPERTY TAX ALLOCATION FORMULAS FOR CITIES NOT ALL CITIES ARE CREATED EQUAL AND SO CERTAIN CITIES GET CERTAIN PERCENT PERCENTAGE BACK ON PROPERTY TAX AND THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WANTING TO BUILD YOU KNOW HOUSING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT COMES ALSO WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR CITIES THESE FIRE PUBLIC WORKS PARKS AND RECREATION I CAN GO ON AND ON AND SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION THAT THE FEDERAL COURT IN ORANGE COUNTY HAS PROVIDED PROVIDING TWELVE HUNDRED TEMPORARY SHELTER BEDS IS NOT A FINAL SOLUTION FOR ORANGE COUNTY AND OR FOR THE REST OF THIS REGION OR THIS STATE I WOULD IMPLORE YOU ALL TO LOOK AT THESE FUNDING ALLOCATION SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS FUNDING SYSTEMS THAT ARE SUSTAINABLE FOR CITIES NOW THAT WE'RE MOVING INTO THIS BUSINESS BECAUSE WE CANNOT IGNORE THIS ISSUE ANYMORE AS AS AS CITIES THAT IN FRONT OF OUR FACE THE PUBLIC DOESN'T CARE WHO THE JURISDICTION IS WHETHER IT'S THE COUNTY'S ROLE WHETHER IT'S A STATE ROLE OR FEDERAL WHILE THEY'RE LOOKING AT LOCAL CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND MAYORS AND SAY THIS IS YOUR JOB YOU BETTER ADDRESS IT AND SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO IN IN IN THE PAST NINE MONTHS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH JUDGE CARTER ON ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO HELP CITIES MAXIMIZE THEIR ABILITY AND REALLY ENDING AND SHOWING -- THE JUDGE CARTER THAT CITIES ARE BEING IMPACTED IN WAYS LIKE NEVER BEFORE WHETHER YOU'RE DEALING WITH PENSION PROBLEMS WITH PROP THIRTEEN THAT TOOK AWAY FORTY PERCENT OF CITIES LOCAL FUNDING THREE PERCENT F. FIFTY WITH THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN REGARDS TO PENSIONS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL THOSE THINGS HAD UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND SO I THINK THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED WITHOUT ALSO THE CITY THE CITY'S ADMITTING THAT WE CHOSE NOT TO ZONE APPROPRIATELY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE NOT IN MY BACKYARD SO WE HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT THEY WE LACKED MANY OF US LACK THE COURAGE TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE AFFORDABILITY PROBLEMS THAT WE ARE FACING IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE NOW CAUSING OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES LIKE SINGLE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN ARE ENDING UP HOMELESS THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN AT LEVELS SO HIGH BEFORE WHEN I LOOK AT SANTA ANA AND I LOOK AT THE LINK AND TO SEE THE MOUNT OF CHILDREN THAT ARE IN THAT HOMELESS SHELTER WAS SINGLE MOTHERS OR IT'S AN AGING HOMELESS POPULATION IS CONTINUING TO RISE THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF OUR PROBLEM BEFORE IT GETS BETTER IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE THE HOUSING STOCK IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO SUSTAIN THE CURRENT GROWTH IN EACH OF OUR CITIES AND SO THIS IS NOT AN EASY JOB THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE STATE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE OVERNIGHT OR COUNTY GOVERNMENT OR THE CITY IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US TOGETHER WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY BUT WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CITY SHOULD SHOULD NOT BE THE LEADERS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STREAMS TO SUSTAIN WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US AND SO WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR CONTINUING TO GO ON THIS TOUR A BECAUSE I HOPE THAT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEES OF YOU KNOW TOUR HERE IN INTO AN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IN HEARING FROM THE PUBLIC AND FROM THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS I'M NOT JUST IN THIS COUNTY BUT THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE REGION OF BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THOSE ADVOCATES THAT ARE WORKING WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION OR THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ROLLING UP THEIR SLEEVES FOR TWENTY THIRTY YEARS THEY HAVE ALSO -- IN THIS ISSUE BUT ONE SINGLE WHAT I BELIEVE AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT HAS BEEN MISSING IT'S IT'S THE REALLY THE COOP THE COOPERATION BETWEEN ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST IN MY TWELVE YEARS OF OFFICE A DISCONNECT OF OF COMMUNICATING WITH OUR STATE LEGISLATORS WITH OUR COUNTY OFFICIALS IN WANTING TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN IN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AND SO HERE WE ARE TODAY BUT I BELIEVE AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP MITIGATE THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE US IF WE COME TOGETHER SO THANK YOU THANK YOU WE HAVE ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR COMMENT REGARDING MIGHT NOT ONLY FRIEND BUT COLLEAGUES FROM MY COUNSEL DAYS MICHELLE MARTINEZ AND IT'S NOT JUST TO SEE HER PASSION AND WORKING ON THESE DAYS ARE DIFFICULT SCENARIOS THAT CITIES FACE AS FAR AS HOW DO YOU ALLOCATE YOUR DOLLARS WHAT KIND OF BUDGET DO YOU HAVE ANY MANY CASES I START IN ON COUNCIL IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND FULLER TEN AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM TWO THOUSAND FOUR TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND I'D LOVE TO GO TO THE STATE THIS WAS JUST EMERGING SO WE DID NOT HAVE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW MERGING SEE SHELTERS ABOUT NAVIGATION CENTERS AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS ON COUNCIL WE AND WE HAD THE DEATHS OF KELLY THOMAS AND IF THAT HAD NOT ONLY THAT THE IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY TO FOCUS ON ON A KELLY THOMAS WAS A SCHIZOPHRENIC MAN WHO MANY PEOPLE KNEW IN OUR CITY BUT IT ALSO FOCUSED OUR CITY ON ON POLICE REFORM AND FOCUSED OUR CITY ON WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH BEST PRACTICES FOR HOMELESSNESS AND IT WAS REALLY THE VERY BEGINNINGS OF THIS AND REALLY EXPLODED SO I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF SIR HAVE SEEN FROM IN MY CASE TWO THOUSAND FOUR TO NOW TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN THE CONVERSATION BUT NOW WE HAVE SOMETHING IN FRONT OF US IN THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT SO WITH THAT I WILL INTRODUCE OUR NEXT SORRY AS I DUG INTO IT I REALIZING SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SAID AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION IN TERMS OF WHAT IS THE ROLE AS THE STATE THE COUNTY CITIES ALL OF OUR ENGAGE NONPROFITS IN SOLVING NESS AND THE BEFORE WE CAN ACTUALLY BEFORE WE NEED CLARITY ON RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALIGNING RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESOURCES SO IF YOU ARE STARTING WITH IN A BLANK SLATE WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE ROLE AS THE CITY'S VERSES THE COUNTY IN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IN ORANGE COUNTY WE SHOULD SUPPORT OUR LAND USE AND ZONING TO ACCOMMODATE HOMELESS SHELTERS NAVIGATION CENTERS WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL THEM PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ATTAINABLE I DON'T CALL IT AFFORDABLE HOUSING A CALL ATTAINABLE HOUSING THE THE -- THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT CITIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOU KNOW AS A BURKE PERTAINS TO MENTAL HEALTH THAT IS NOT IN OUR PREVIEW THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO OUR POLICE STRUGGLE OUR FIRE STRUGGLE ON THAT IS MORE BY COUNTY ROLE SO I THINK FROM BEING ABLE TO BE SUPPORTED TO DESIGNATE THE LAND USES AND SONY TO ACCOMMODATE THE HOUSING THAT WE NEED IS THE CITY'S ROLE ARE CAN WE PROVIDE GIVEN TO US FROM THE FEDS AND STATE FOR -- HOMELESS SHELTERS IN PROVIDER MONIES THAT WAY AND LEVERAGE THEM HOWEVER WE POSSIBLY CAN WITH THE COUNTY WE SHOULD DEFINITELY DO THAT -- SO I THINK THAT IS THE INITIAL ROLE BUT TODAY THAT HAS CHANGED WE'RE NOW IN THE BUSINESS OF BUILDING HOMELESS SHELTERS WHICH WE CANNOT SUSTAIN WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT THERE'S NO WAY GETTING YOU KNOW SB TWO FUNDS OR THIS NEW MONIES COMING DOWN THIS ONE TIME MONEY SO HOW WE GOING TO STAY IN THESE OPERATIONS AND NOT ONLY THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE CODE ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE ALL THESE CODE ENFORCEMENT TEAMS OUT THERE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR POLICE ARE ARE PARKS AND REC AND THE MORE MORE WE GROW THE MORE MORE SERVICES LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES NEED AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH -- REVENUE COMING IN TO SUSTAIN THAT A GREAT THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER YET THANK YOU SO I HAVE AT NINE CITIES TO ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE SITUATION ALSO AND ARE TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE ON AND ARE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH JUDGE CARTER IN OUR NOT HAVING THAT DISCUSSION THAT THEY HAVE GONE INTO THE BUSINESS OF HOMELESSNESS BUT THEY'RE DOWN FACING WITH THE REALITY OF HOW DO WE PAY FOR THIS FOR A WHILE THE FELLOW THEY'RE NOT EQUIPPED WITH THE SKILL SET BUT BE THERE DEFINITELY THINKING ABOUT THOSE DOLLARS WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO COME FROM BUT THEY'RE HEARING FROM THE CONSTITUENTS AND THEY SAID THAT THEY CAN'T WAIT FOR ALL OF US FIGURE IT OUT THE COUNTY FOR ALL OF ITS BECAUSE HER FIGHT TO SEE AN ACTION BUT THERE'S A LOT OF STRESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NOW IS HE TAKING THIS ACTION IF AND THERE'S DIFFERENT MODELS I MEAN IF THE FUNDING COMES AND IT'S A STATE OF WILL TO THE CITY'S BE IN THE BUSINESS OF RUNNING THESE OPERATIONS ARE SHOULD IT SHOULD BE IN THE COUNTY OR SOMEBODY ELSE IS ALSO PART OF THE QUESTION THAT THERE THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH AND SO WHAT WOULD HE SAY THAT SO I WOULD SAY THAT TODAY'S A NEW DAY WORD TWENTY FIRST CENTURY GOVERNMENT AND WE'VE NOW ARE STEPPING UP TO TAKE ON THIS ROLE AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT YES CITIES CAN BUILD THE BRICK AND MORTAR IT IT IS KIND OF PRIVATIZING IT OUT TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WHETHER TO LIMÓN NATION FOUNDATION MERCY HOUSE ON AND SO FORTH IF WE HAVE THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STREAM TO GIVE THOSE MONIES TO THOSE NONPROFIT I DON'T SEE WHY NOT A CITY CANNOT PARTNER WITH UP THE PRIVATE WITH WITH THE NONPROFIT I CALL IN A P. FOR NOT A P. THREE WHICH IS A PEOPLE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THE THE PEOPLE ARE THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY IN HAVING AND ENSURING THAT WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT BUILDING ON EMERGENCY SHELTER AND THE BUT THIS VERY CITIES IN YOUR CITY AND MY GOOD FRIEND WAS THE MAYOR OF JUAN GARCIA BELLFLOWER HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH THEM FOR OVER A YEAR AND WE'RE BEEN ABLE TO BRING HIM WITH JUDGE CARTER WAS THAT WE CANNOT CLOSE OUR EYES WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT SO I WOULD SAY THAT YES WE CAN MOVE TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY IF THE STATE IS COMMITTED TO GET A NOSE ONGOING RESOURCES TO SUSTAIN THE OPERATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT COST THE MOST WHEN YOU'RE GIVING US THE ONE TIME FUNDS FOR BRICK AND MORTAR THAT IS FANTASTIC THAT'S EASY TO TO NO BRAINER BUT IT'S THE ONGOING COST SO A LOT OF THESE GRANTS THERE'S A SUNSET SO WHAT'S NEXT AFTER THIS BILLION DOLLARS IS GONE WHAT ARE CITIES GOING TO DO I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN YOUR DISTRICT SHOULD BE ASKING AND THEY SHOULD PUT A PAUSE OR CAN THEY LEVERAGE THEIR RESOURCES AND SAY HEY WE'RE GONNA USE PUBLIC SAFETY WE'RE GONNA BE LIKE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY CREATE THIS PARTNERSHIP A GPA AND SAY HATE FIVE CITIES ARE GOING TO COME TOGETHER AND SHARE PUBLIC SAFETY RESOURCES WE'RE GOING TO SHARE AND LEVERAGE OUR CBG FUNDING AND AND PUT IT TOGETHER AND CREATE THE HELP EACH OF THE CITIES SO THAT ONE CITY DOESN'T AND KERR MOST OF THE COSTS AND SO YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY SPOT MODEL IS AN OPTION DAY I DO BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE PLAYS A ROLE IN THIS BUT AGAIN IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR CITIES AND SO WE'VE WE'VE HAD THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SHELTERS WHICH IS THE EMERGENCY HOUSING BUT THERE'S BEEN MULTIPLE COMMENTS TODAY BEING MADE BY A NUMBER OF PANELISTS THE CITY MANAGER THAT WE HAVE A HOUSE IS A PLACE YOU KNOW WE NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S MORE PERMANENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WOULD ALL HAVE THIS CONTINUOUS CYCLE GOING ON IS A FIFTY TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A SINGLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THIS EMERGENCY SHELTERS YOU SHOULD BE WE SHOULD BE MANDATED SOME SORT OF SIGNING TO GUARANTEE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO FILL THE I MEAN WE HAVE A DENSITY ISSUE COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE I WOULD GO BEYOND JUST EMERGENCY SHELTERS YOU NEED INTEGRATED HOUSING RIGHT SO YOU BUILD SO THIS IS WHERE I TALK ABOUT MAXIMIZING YOUR LAND IF YOU'RE GOING TO MATCH MY STATE FEDERAL OR LOCAL LAND YOU WANT TO DO INTEGRATED HOUSING BUILD A SHELTER AT THE BOTTOM AND AND AND DO YOU KNOW SINGLE I FORGET WHAT THEY'RE CALLED -- SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY AND OTHER WRAPAROUND SERVICES SO YOU CAN MAXIMIZE YOUR LAN AND MAXIMIZE YOUR RESOURCES AND LEVERAGE AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN BUT JUST BUILDING AN EMERGENCY SHELTER AND SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OKAY WHERE AM I GONNA FIND GLAND TODAY BILL PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ON AND SO FORTH I THINK IF WE WANT TO INDUSTRY HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT INTEGRATED MODELS AND AND AND UNDERSTAND THAT SPEAK SPECIFICALLY IN YOUR AREA ASSEMBLY GARCIA YOU GUYS HAVE A SMALL FOOTPRINT RIGHT SO YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY BUILT OUT YOU'RE GOING TO EITHER HAVE TO GO UP AND LOOK AT THE LAND THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE BUT YOU CAN'T JUST BUILD A SHELTER STAND ALONE AND THEN TRY TO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO BUILD PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S NEVER GOING TO PENCIL OUT AND SO I AGREE WE NEED TO BE BUILDING AL AND SO I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT MY CITIES ARE STARTING TO TAKE HIS PRACTICE STEPS AND I THINK AT A MINIMUM ABOUT THE RAPPER OF AT THE SHELTER CENTER AND IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR A WHILE WHEN I GOT ELECTED SEVEN YEARS AGO WE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE HOMELESS PEOPLE HERE AND I THINK OR DO YOU SO THEY OPEN THEIR EYES A LITTLE BIT RIGHT AND SO PROGRESS THEY'RE NOT HAVE OTHER MY CITIES IN THAT WHO ARE NOT TAKING BOTH HOURS LEAD -- AS WELL BUT THERE'S THIS BIG FIGHT AGAIN ABOUT BUILDING UP IN MY CITIES HAVE ALSO BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF FIGHTING THE BUILDUP MODEL AND BUT THIS KIND OF KNOW WHERE ELSE TO OTHER RIGHTS I THOUGHT THE STATE I WANT TO HELP MY CITIES GET THAT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION MANY DENTAL TO DO THE RIGHT THING AFTER THINKING ABOUT BUILDING UP AND HOW DO WE GET COMMUNITIES TO DO THAT AND BE READY FOR THAT BECAUSE THE ABILITY THE CHARGE AGAINST THIS IDEA OF BUILDING UP BUT THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO BUILD TO STEP COULD I LIVE IN IN MY HOMETOWN SORT OF THE DEFICIT PUTS IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY EXACTLY ALL RIGHT SO WE OURS NOW REALLY STARTING TO BE BEHIND ON TIME IS SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR NEXT TWO PANELS AND FOR THE THE MEMBERS OUT THERE WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS -- SO I AM LOOKING AT THE CLOCK AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE YOU GET THE TIME THAT SPECIFIED BUT ON THE PUBLIC COMMENTS WE'RE GONNA TRY TO WRAP UP THE WHOLE PROGRAM BY ELEVEN THIRTY SO THAT WOULD PUT US A LITTLE BIT BEHIND BUT AGAIN MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CONTACT NUMBER IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN ALWAYS GET INFORMATION TIAS SO WITHOUT WE'RE GOING TO -- BRING FORWARD TO OUR NEXT PANELIST SUSAN PRICE WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF CARE COORDINATION FOR ORANGE COUNTY I KNOW SHE'S CALLED BIZARRE AHEAD OF HOMELESSNESS I ONLY SAY THAT BECAUSE ANY OF US WHO ARE WORKING FORWARD WE DON'T ALWAYS GET CALLED THE BEST NAMES IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THINGS THAT PEOPLE JUST EITHER AREN'T FAMILIAR WORTH I DON'T WANT SO WITHOUT SUSAN SO WITH THAT ALSO YOU CAN CALL ME SU IF YOU'D LIKE -- BUT THERE'S NO OTHER NAMES -- GOOD MORNING EVERYONE IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY -- FOR WHAT IS A ROBUST DIALOGUE ABOUT SOMETHING I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT AND THAT IS HOMELESSNESS AND THE IMPACTS ON OUR COMMUNITY I AM OKAY WHO'S GOT THE CLICKER BEHIND ME YEAH AWESOME PERFECT -- SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS SLIDE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I THERE'S SO MUCH DIALOGUE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN HAD IN AND TO BE EFFICIENT WITH TIME I JUST KIND OF WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- SOME OF THE KEY HIGHLIGHTS THAT I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT FOR US LOCALLY AND ON SOME OFF SOME OPERATIONAL SUGGESTIONS FOR THE STATE AS WELL SO WHEN YOU KNOW IN IN MY ROLE WITH THE COUNTY OF ORANGE I'VE I'VE BEEN WITH THE COUNTY ABOUT THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND WHEN I DID MY INITIAL ASSESSMENT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN -- YOU KNOW AT THAT TIME WE WERE HAVING THE DIALOGUE ABOUT THE INTERSECTION OF HOMELESSNESS WITH MULTIPLE SYSTEMS ACROSS ANY COMMUNITY AND YOU KNOW THAT THE EXCHANGE THAT WE JUST HAD ABOUT KIND OF WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT AND WHO IS TO DO WHICH PART OF THIS IT'S KIND OF LIKE GOING TO AN AIR SHOW AND WATCHING THE BLUE ANGELS FLY WITHIN TWO FEET OF EACH OTHER FIVE PLANES IN ALIGNMENT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR US TO EFFECTIVELY SOLVE HOMELESSNESS IN ANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND THOSE FIVE PLANES INCLUDE BASICALLY THE CITIES THE COUNTY THE STATE THE CONSTITUENCIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT THESE SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS THE HOMELESS POPULATION THEMSELVES SO THAT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT SERVICE RESISTANCE AND YOU KNOW I COULD TALK FOR A WHILE ABOUT THAT BUT I'M GOING TO TABLE THAT FOR JUST A MOMENT THAT ANYONE TRULY CHOOSES TO BE HOMELESS I THINK SOMETIMES -- THE THE OVERWHELMING BARRIERS THAT A PERSON FACES ALLOWS HIM TO RESIGN THEMSELVES TO A PLIGHT THAT SEEMS OVERWHELMING TO OVERCOME AND SO WITH THAT I'M JUST GONNA -- MOVE ON TO HEALTH CARE AND TALK A BIT ABOUT THE COUNTY'S ROLE IN THE COUNTIES PARTNERS ON I'M STILL ON THE FIRST SLIDE ON HEALTH CARE IS YOU KNOW THE THE STATE'S MEDICAID WAIVER PROGRAM FOR WHOLE PERSON CARE GAVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT HIGH UTILIZES WHO ARE HOMELESS WHO WORK -- INTERSECTING WITH -- THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SYSTEM A VERY KEY PROGRAM -- WHICH I KNOW IS COMING TO AN END IN THE NEXT YEAR OR SO -- THE COUNTY IS ALSO ENGAGING VERY PROACTIVELY WITH CAL OPTIMO WHICH IS OUR MEDI CAL PROVIDER IN THE COUNTY -- TO INTEGRATE THEIR EFFORTS ON THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS THAT WE HAVE I'M AS WAS MENTIONED BY -- CHIEF C. N. AS AROUND LAW ENFORCEMENT NON PROFITS ARE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ON THE STREETS DOING MULTI DISCIPLINARY OUT REACH TO THE POPULATIONS ARE HOSPITALS ARE IMPACTED AS IS OBVIOUSLY MENTIONED -- SB ELEVEN FIFTY TWO AND HAVING TO DISCHARGE PEOPLE THAT ARE YOU KNOW MEDICALLY CLEARED BUT VULNERABLE WHEN YOU'RE COMING OUT OF AN INPATIENT STAY YOU'RE STILL VULNERABLE MEDICALLY EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT BE MEDICALLY CLEARED LEGALLY SYSTEM THE MOST APPROPRIATE PLACE -- YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS BEEN ABLE TO FILL THAT GAP IN GIVING US FOR COOPER OF CARE BEDS A STEP DOWN MODEL FROM BEING AN IN PATIENT IN THE HOSPITAL TO HAVING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE UPON DISCHARGE AND RECUPERATIVE CARES BEN REALLY CRITICAL TO THAT ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- YOU KNOW THIS IS A BIG TOPIC -- OF COURSE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE AS WELL AS ON THE ADDICTION SIDE AND I'LL JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS THE IN NEEDED DRIVE PROPERTY WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS AND PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF THAT FOR OVER A YEAR -- WE'RE WE'RE REALLY BEHIND THE CURVE ON HOW MANY OF THOSE WE ULTIMATELY NEED IN THE COUNTY -- AND SO WE'RE WE'RE FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS MODEL COMING FORWARD THAT WILL INFORM AND BE REPLICATED BOWL NOT JUST IN ORANGE COUNTY BUT ANYWHERE IN THE STATE -- AND THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO DECOMPRESS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS TO TALK ABOUT THE SOBERING CENTERS TO DEAL WITH THE -- BE A CRISIS THAT IS ALSO -- BEEN TOUCHED UPON IN OUR DIALOGUE HERE TODAY -- AND THAT IS YOU KNOW ONE LOCATION WE TALK ABOUT ACCESS AND NAVIGATION ACROSS ANY OF OUR SYSTEMS OF CARE ACCESS AND NAVIGATION ARE PART OF OUR PROBLEM IN THAT PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHERE OR HOW TO ACCESS SOME OF THESE RESOURCES AND SO WHAT WE HEAR TODAY IN WHAT WE WHAT WE SEE ON OUR STREETS IS A TREMENDOUS INFUSION AN EXPANSION OF OUR OUT REACH CAPACITY -- TO REACH THE POPULATIONS AND -- SO I'M GONNA MOVE ON FROM THERE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M I'M LIMITED ON TIME -- I HAVE FIVE MINUTES WHILE -- THIS IS ALL THAT FIVE MINUTES I PROMISE SO COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS ON STEPPING UP INITIATIVE WE'VE A RICHARD SANCHEZ JUST CAME UP A MINUTE AGO TO TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE GO FROM IN CUSTODY THE OUT OF CUSTODY IN A SEAMLESS TRANSITION FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE AN OPIATE DISORDER THAT NEED TO NEED TO GET MATT TREATMENT IN CUSTODY AND OUT OF CUSTODY AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND WE LOOK AT OUR REENTRY PROGRAMS AND I'M GONNA JUST TALK ABOUT THESE BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED TIME THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AND JUST FUND HOMELESSNESS WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE RE ENTRY SYSTEM REENTRY IS A RELATIVELY NEW TOPIC -- FROM CORRECTIONAL REFORM YOU KNOW OVER THE COURSE FROM AS COREY C. N. AS SAID TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO NOW WE ALL OF A SUDDEN HAVE A NEW LINE OF BUSINESS RE ENTRY FROM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM NONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES WERE WELL EQUIPPED HAD THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE CAPACITY TO ADDRESS REENTRY EFFECTIVELY FROM THE BEGINNING SO THE PROP FORTY SEVEN GRANTS THE CAME OUT THEY WERE COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO CAME FROM THE STATE COMPETITIVE TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT WERE ALL IMPACTED BY CORRECTIONAL REFORM BUT NOT EVERY COUNTY GOT FUNDING WE'RE FORTUNATE ORANGE COUNTY TO RECEIVE SOME FUNDING ON THE RE ENTRY PEACE BUT IT WAS THREE YEARS AFTER THE REENTRY OCCURRED AND SO ALL SAY TO YOU THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT RE ENTRY AND WE LOOK AT SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS AROUND PROP FORTY SEVEN IN THE DECLASSIFICATION OF NON VIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES THE INFRASTRUCTURE WASN'T THERE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THOSE NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OFTENTIMES IS HOMELESSNESS BUT I I I I ASK YOU TO NOT LOOK AT HOMELESSNESS AS THE PROBLEM HOMELESSNESS IS THE SYMPTOM OF THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE LOTS OF REDEVELOPMENT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND TEN YEARS OF CITIES NOT HAVING THE FUNDING TO CREATE HOUSING THAT'S TEN YEAR ATTRITION OF NOT DEVELOPING ANY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN CITIES OR THE HOUSING AND ON THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE SIDE NOT HAVING AND THERE'S A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE DIALOGUE GOING ON IT'S VERY PROACTIVE AROUND THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE THINGS -- ABOUT -- CREDENTIALING THESE THINGS AS WE WOULD COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING FOR JUVENILES AND AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE ARE WE GOING TO -- IDENTIFY WHAT'S THE MOST APPROPRIATE TREATMENT OPTION FOR A PERSON WHEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS JUST NOT THERE -- SO IN THE HEALTH CARE AGENCY THE DRUG MEDI CAL PROGRAM ON THE COUNTY OF ORANGE IS IMPLEMENTING THAT WHICH GIVES US AT LEAST AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT AND I WON'T GO SO FAR TO SAY ACCREDITATION OF A TREATMENT SYSTEM THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR COMMUNITIES SIDE OR SHARE STUDENT AMAZING JOB TO ADDRESS THE IN CUSTODY IN THE OUT OF CUSTODY ROLE ON THE HEALTH CARE -- CORRECTIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS IS TRYING TO INTEGRATE THAT WITH THE PROP FORTY SEVEN REENTRY CENTER ON THAT WE RECEIVED A COMPETITIVE FUNDING FOR SO YOU SEE ALL THESE PIECES STARTING TO COME TOGETHER ON THE HOUSING SIDE YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HOUSING TRUST FUND WE HAVE TWENTY TWO OUT OF THIRTY FOUR CITIES THAT HAVE SIGNED ON TO THAT -- I'M IMPRESSED BY THE LEVEL OF PIPELINE THAT IS ALREADY AND IS IN DEVELOPMENT AS A RESULT OF JUST THE DIALOGUE AROUND CREATING THE TRUST FUND GETTING THIS CITY SIGNED ON TO IT -- THERE'S MORE THAN A THOUSAND UNITS ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE AND ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED THAT ARE SEEKING FUNDING SO THE COUNTIES MOVING FORWARD QUICKLY IN THE HOUSING TRUST FUND IN AND CERTAINLY WE NEED A A LOT MORE MONEY EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT MONEY WE ALL NEED A TON MORE MONEY -- ON THE BENEFITS AND SUPPORT SERVICES ALL JUST KIND OF MAKE A HIGHLIGHTER AND ON THE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR BOARD AND CHAIRS IS OFTEN A CHALLENGE -- FOR US TO BE ABLE TO USE THE BORDEN CARES EFFECTIVELY TO TREAT PEOPLE THAT ARE BORN WILL DISABLED WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AS WELL AS PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SOME IN A BLAZE REALLY QUICKLY THROUGH THIS -- SLIDE PRESENTATION IN A NINETY SECOND SO NEXT SLIDE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED -- THIS IS AN INITIATIVE THAT I BROUGHT FORWARD IN MY ASSESSMENT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I BELIEVE AND I I THINK I CONCUR WITH WITH EVERYONE WHO'S HERE REPRESENTING A CITY THAT NO ONE CITY IS GOING TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR NEIGHBORS AND THAT THE NOR SERVICE PLANNING AREA HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY ABLE TO CREATE A A SUBSTANTIAL MO YOU TO PARTNER AND SHARE ON THIS EVEN COLLECTIVELY REQUIRING THE COUNTY'S RESOURCES TO MAKE THAT A REALITY -- AND SO I'M SUPER PROUD OF THE NORTH -- SPOTS CITIES TO BE ABLE TO PULL THAT TOGETHER FINE TO APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS AND EFFECTIVELY ACKNOWLEDGING REALIZE THAT THAT HOMELESSNESS IS A REGIONAL ISSUE AND YOU KNOW THIS THIS IDEA OF TRYING TO ESTABLISH A RESIDENCY -- IMPACT FOR A PERSON ENTERING A SHELTER IS VERY VERY CHALLENGING TO SAY WELL YOU'RE FROM HERE YOU CAN YOU KNOW -- THE RESIDENCY PIECES VERY DIFFICULT BUT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE -- IN OF ADDRESS THEM PROACTIVELY SO WITH THE SHELTERS BEING DEVELOPED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEING EXPENDED FOR THE SHELTER SYSTEM HAS ME AND MANY OTHERS CONCERNED THAT WE NEED AN EXIT FROM THE SHELTER SYSTEM THE GO TO THE HOMELESS COUNT NUMBERS JUST QUICKLY BACK TO THE HOMELESS COUNT -- SO IN THE IN THE ON SHELTER NUMBER OF THIRTY NINE SIXTY ONE AND ALL ALL SAY TO YOU THAT THESE ARE THE MOST ACCURATE FIGURES WE'VE EVER SEEN AN ORANGE COUNTY BECAUSE WE TALKED TO EVERY HOMELESS PERSON THAT WE CAME ACROSS IN THE COUNTY -- GIS MAP LOCATIONS FOR WHERE THE SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED I AM TOLD I NEED TO STOP AND I HAVE -- TWO MORE MINUTES YES ME THANK YOU -- AND I WILL SAY TO YOU THAT ON THE SHELTERED COUNT THERE WERE SIX HUNDRED ADDITIONAL BEDS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT DID NOT EXIST IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THERE'S PROBABLY ANOTHER FIVE TO SIX HUNDRED BEDS THAT WERE NOT HERE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT ARE HERE NOW OR IN THE PIPELINE AND SO I'LL SAY TO YOU AT SOME POINT WE NEED TO PIVOT FROM DEVELOPMENT OF THE SHELTER SYSTEM WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW AND I I WANT TO PAUSE TO SAY SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES CALL ME REGULARLY FROM AROUND THE STATE AND SAY YOU KNOW HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO DEVELOP ALL THE SHELTER BEDS BECAUSE THEY ARE YEARNING TO CREATE AN URGENT RESPONSE TO THE STREET POPULATION IN ORANGE COUNTY IS SUCCESSFULLY IN THE IN THE A MODE OF DOING SO AND YOU KNOW WE WE TAKE A LITTLE CRITICISM THERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT HOUSING FIRST AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY HOMELESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES BY PROVIDING EMERGENCY SHELTER PIECE -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S TIME TO PIVOT FROM THOSE THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE AND BEING FULLY DEVELOPED -- THOSE WILL BE THE SHELTER SYSTEM GOING FORWARD I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE THOSE WE ULTIMATELY NEED BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE IT AND GET INTO THE PERMANENT HOUSING AND THE SYSTEM OF CARE RIGHT NOW IS HOUSING ABOUT FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE NEAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN OUR SYSTEM THAT ARE WORKING PROGRAMS THAT ARE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY YOUR SECURE HOUSING IS SIXTY FIVE PERCENT SO A FIFTY FIVE PERCENT SORRY I MESSED THAT UP -- SO WITH THAT WHEN WE PUT PEOPLE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THE RETENTION RATES NINETY NINE PERCENT SO YES HOUSING WORKS HOUSING IS THE SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS -- BUT MOVING FORWARD FROM THERE I WANT TO GO TO -- I'M GONNA SKIP THAT YOU ALL KNOW WHERE THE BEDS ARE IN THE NORTH PART OF THE COUNTY -- REALLY QUICKLY PREVENTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOMELESSNESS THAT'S THE SYMPTOM THE ISSUE IS PREVENTION ON THE FRONT END A MINIMUM OF TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF OUR POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BECOME HOMELESS IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN COUNT I BECAME HOMELESS IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS SO WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE ON THE FRONT END AND YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SOMEWHAT A ROAD ID THE PREVENTION RESOURCES DUE TO THE LACK OF RESEARCH THAT PREVENTION IS EFFECTIVE SO YOU'LL SEE THAT OUR OUR SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE ARE ARE SOMEWHAT UNDER UNDER FUNDED WITH REGARDS TO PREVENTION AND DIVERSION ON THE FRONT END AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT OUR CONTINUUM OF CARE JURISDICTION WILL TAKE A A GOOD STRONG LOOK AT THAT WITH REGARDS TO THE STATE FUNDING COMING DOWN IT'S ONE TIME MONEY PREVENTION IS A VERY -- -- EFFECTIVE TOOL I WILL TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS ROSE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT INCOME AS WELL WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IT WAS SAID EARLIER THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT DON'T HAVE AN INCOME AT ALL -- THERE'S A TO A TON OF REASONS FOR THAT WHICH I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO INTO BUT I WILL SAY TO YOU THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THIS JURISDICTION AND ACROSS THE STATE THAT ARE DISABLED THEY ARE CLEARLY DISABLED THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING GENERAL RELIEF BUT THEY'RE ALSO NOT RECEIVING FEDERAL DISABILITY PAYMENTS AND SO THAT'S WHERE THAT OTHER PLANE FLIES NEXT TO US IS THE FEDERAL DISABILITY SYSTEM IS VERY VERY CHALLENGING IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A HOMELESS PERSON TO NAVIGATE IT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE SOMETIMES EVEN FOR CASE MANAGEMENT TO NAVIGATE THAT ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENTS -- TRUTH BE KNOWN AND THEREFORE WE TRAIN PEOPLE WHAT THE SORE PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THAT BUT IT REQUIRES MEDI CAL IT REQUIRES A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND IT PROVIDES A YOU KNOW A HISTORY OF MEDICAL CARE THE DOCUMENTS ALONG AND WAS STANDING DISABILITY -- I TALKED ABOUT THE LINK TO STAY IN SHELTERS THIS IS -- PROBABLY A NUMBER ONE OR TOP FIVE ISSUE FOR ME IN A IN MONITORING THE SHELTER THE GROWING SHELTER SYSTEM AND HOW LONG PEOPLE ARE STAYING THERE AND WHETHER THEY'RE EXITING SUCCESSFULLY OR NOT -- GIVEN THE LENGTH OF STAY IT'S DIFFICULT TO STAY IN A SHELTER LONG TERM IF YOU DON'T SEE THE OUTCOME OF FORESEEABLE IN YOUR STAY THERE MOVING FORWARD TO THE NEXT SLIDE I'M AND I DID TALK ABOUT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE -- THE MAT PROGRAM WAS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BIG STRONG KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH AN OP A CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT IN OUR COUNTRY AND YOU'RE NEVER WOULD WE THOUGHT -- HOW DO WE SITE -- METHADONE CLINICS IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO TRYING TO DECIDE A HOMELESS SHELTERS CHALLENGING -- BUT CITING A METHADONE CLINIC CITING CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS CITING A SOBERING CENTER AT CETERA THESE ARE THINGS THAT REQUIRE COMMUNITY EDUCATION THEY REQUIRE COMMUNITY INVESTMENT AND KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING THESE THINGS ARE BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS NOT DOING THAT -- WE NEED TO PROVIDE TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND TREATMENT IS NOT ONE THING TREATMENT AS MULTIPLE THINGS AS I THINK I'VE DESCRIBED FAIRLY EFFECTIVELY OR EFFICIENTLY IN THE TIME I HAVE -- HOMELESS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT MOTEL CONVERSIONS BIG FAN OF THOSE JOB ANAHEIM'S DOING A GREAT JOB THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHERS BUT THERE'S BEEN AT LEAST FIVE IN THE TIME I'VE BEEN HERE -- WE DID SOME IN LONG BEACH AS WELL AND WHAT IT DOES IS GIVE YOU SEVENTY UNITS IN ONE SHOT HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT'S LIKE SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS PEOPLE THAT WERE POTENTIALLY LIVING IN AN ENCAMPMENT LIKE THE CIVIC CENTER WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED IN ORANGE COUNTY AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE ENCAMPMENT WENT ON TO LIVE IN THE ORCHARD WHERE THEY COULD MAINTAIN THEIR THEIR COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS WHILE ALSO BEING HOUSE A VERY SUCCESSFUL MODEL THERE -- AND THEN THE HOUSING TRUST FUND WHICH ALL APPEAL TO THE STATE MONEY MONEY MONEY -- NEXT SLIDE -- MARCHING HOME TO END VETERAN HOMELESSNESS I'LL TAKE OPPORTUNITY IN PERSON AT THANK YOU A COPY PETRIE-NORRIS FOUR OF THE INFUSION OF MONEY FOR VETERANS INITIATIVE MARCHING HOME TO END VETERAN HOMELESSNESS UNITED WAYS HERE TODAY AS WELL -- WE HAVE MORE BASH VOUCHERS AND WE HAVE HOMELESS VETERANS -- AND SO THANK YOU TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THAT BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN ISSUE IN OUR COMMUNITY OF AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN TRYING TO IDENTIFY LANDLORDS UNITED WAY IS DOING AN AMAZING JOB ON THE LANDLORD INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO TO TRY TO OVERCOME EVERY BARRIER THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING IN AND YOU CAN TELL FROM MY PRESENTATION THAT WE ARE HITTING THIS ISSUE FROM EVERY CORNER AND WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS NOT JUST THE FRONT END THE METAL AND THE BACK END OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THIS BUT -- MOVING ON TO ANOTHER SLIDE HERE AT THE END -- DATA INTEGRATION IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY THE STATE THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SERVING THE SAME PEOPLE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT OUR RESOURCES ARE SO EXTREMELY LIMITED AND YOU KNOW THE TALK OF HOUSING FIRST -- IT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE THAT WE CAN SERVE A PERSON ONCE AND SERVE THEM SUCCESSFULLY AND SO DATA INTEGRATION IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE REQUIRED THE COUNTY IS ENGAGING IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF THIS TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEMS ACCESS TO IMPROVE NAVIGATION TO IMPROVE THE RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS AND HOW WE CAN SERVE PEOPLE FLEE ONCE AND AND SERVE THEM BETTER -- AND TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THE MOST VULNERABLE FIRST -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES THAT WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF THE SYSTEM OF CARE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM -- AND SO IN SUMMARY AND TO FINISH -- MY MY TOP FOUR LIST THAT I'VE GOT HERE'S THE OVERSIGHT CAPACITY BUILDING FOR THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT SYSTEM ON THAT IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT POPULAR WE HAVE A POPULATION WAS SUCH A SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT THAT EVEN THE DISCUSSION OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS NOT UNNECESSARILY REALISTIC AND SO WERE WERE FREQUENTLY LOOKING FOR THIS COMMUNITY BASED OUR RESPONSE WERE APPROACH AND YOU KNOW THE BOARDING CARE ISSUES COMING UP A LOT IN THE RE ENTRY DISCUSSION ALSO COMING UP IN THE MENTAL HEALTH DISCUSSION AROUND THE MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES BEING LOWER -- FOR FOR THOSE HEALTH CONDITION AND MAYBE IT WOULD BE FOR DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED POPULATION AND I I'M NOT SURE WHY -- BUT YOU KNOW WE WE REALLY NEED TO MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THEN ON THE RE ENTRY SIDE -- FUNDING FOR RE ENTRY SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING BECAUSE IN THE HOMELESS SYSTEM OF CARE WE'VE GOT PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL JUSTICE BACKGROUNDS AND WE'VE GOT PEOPLE WITH RE ENTRY NEEDS THAT ARE NOT REALLY GETTING THEIR NEEDS MET IN THE HOMELESS SYSTEM IN THE IN THE SHELTER SYSTEM PER SE AND SO I I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A -- A DIFFERENT SET OF SOLUTIONS FOR PEOPLE IN RE ENTRY A SMALLER ENVIRONMENT A SOBRE ENVIRONMENT A PLACE WHERE LIFE SKILLS AND FINANCIAL LITERACY ARE PARAMOUNT TO A PERSON ACTUALLY WORKING FOR AN EMPLOYER WHO TAKES BALANCE AND A HOUSING PROGRAM THAT ALSO TAKES FELONS SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT WE'RE JUST CAN INTEGRATE ALL OF THAT INTO THE HOMELESS SYSTEM AND HOPE THAT OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN MANAGE THE COMPLEXITY ALL IN ONE LOCATION -- I THINK THAT IS A RECIPE FOR MULTIPLE CHALLENGES FROM THE HEALTH CARE SIDE THE REENTRY SIDE MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE ALL IN ONE LOCATION VERY CHALLENGING TO BE EFFECTIVE ON ALL OF THOSE FRONTS -- AND WITHOUT IT WILL STOP AND THANK YOU FOR THE EXTRA TIME THANK YOU AND -- MAYBE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE STRAIGHT TO OUR NEXT PALACES YES THANKS RAPTURE SOON THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE SPEND A MONTH TO THE UP IN SACRAMENTO WHAT'S SO WHAT'S THE CURRENT PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDING AT THE COUNTY WHAT WHAT HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU GUYS HAVE BECAUSE I THINK THE LAST SUMMER HERBS TO AND FOURTEEN MILLION AND WE HAVE RICHARD SANCHEZ HERE FROM THE HEALTH CARE AGENCY I DON'T HAVE THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION IN FRONT OF ME I'M NOT SURE WHAT HE DOES AT THE ABBOTT AUDIT THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THAT AT THAT NUMBER AND I BELIEVE THE NUMBER WAS TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION IS A THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD NOW -- WE WE DO NOT HAVE THAT AMOUNT WE SPEND IT DOWN MOSTLY ON -- WHAT'S CALLED S. AN H. P. MONEY WHICH IS PERMITS PART OF HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THE COUNTY MORE UNITS IN FOUR CITIES IT'S MOSTLY IN A BIZARRE SPOT AND SO AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME ALL OF OUR BUT DOLLARS ARE EITHER ALLOCATED OR SPENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO -- ALL THE SERVERS IN SOUTH COUNTY LOOKS LIKE SOUTH COUNTIES LOW BEHIND THE OTHER AREAS SAP'S IS THERE A HOLD UP -- DO YOU KNOW WHY SOUTH COUNTY IS LAGGING BEHIND THE OTHER AREAS THERE I WILL SAY TO YOU THAT PLANNING AREAS TO CITIES ARE MEETING -- AND I THINK THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND I SIT IN A LOT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS LEAVE IN THE SOUTH COUNTY -- THERE'S A DIALOGUE GOING ON ACROSS THIS COUNTY IN ALL THREE SERVICE PLANNING AREAS I THINK IN THE SOUTH SERVICE PLANNING YOUR IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THEY HAVE A LOT LESS OF A VISIBLE PROBLEM THAN WHAT WE SEE IN CENTRAL AND NORTH SO THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT LATE TO THE TABLE ON HAVING TO REACT OR RESPOND TO SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT'S FAIRLY -- ISOLATED YOU LOOK AT SOUTH COUNTY I MEAN IT'S NOT A A TRANSIT FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT IF YOU'RE HOMELESS YOU WANT TO BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION AND FOOD AND RESOURCES AND YOU KNOW IT YOU'RE YOU'RE IN KIND OF A URBAN AREA WHEN YOU GET TO SOUTH COUNTY IT'S IT'S QUITE A WALK FROM A TO B. AND SO THE POPULATION THERE IS KIND OF A CONGREGATING AROUND THE COASTAL AREAS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND AND I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S TRUE ACROSS THE STATE I COME FROM THE CITY LONG BEACH FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AND EVERY COASTAL CITY HAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT MIGRATORY PATTERN OF HOMELESS POPULATIONS USING A BEACH AMENITIES AND ASSETS AS WELL AS THE ISOLATION OF THE BEACHES AT NIGHT FOR A SLEEPING AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO YOU KNOW THE ISSUES ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ON THE COASTAL SIDE THAN WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN THE BROADER SELF SERVICE PLANNING EVERY MOST OF THOSE CITIES HAVE VERY FEW HOMELESS PEOPLE THERE AND DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY AN OUT REACH TO -- BUT YOU KNOW I WILL ASSURE YOU THE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING ABOUT YOU KNOW GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL BEDS DOWN THERE SAN CLEMENTE HAS A RESOURCE CENTER -- THAT'S IN A CITY BUILDING SO I MEAN THEY'RE DOING A LOT DOWN THERE IN SAN CLEMENTE LAGUNA BEACH HAS BEEN DOING A LOT THERE'S ACTUALLY THE FIRST SHELTER IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT I REMEMBER WORKING WITH IN THE THE MID NINETIES SO I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY HAPPENING IN THE SOUTH PART OF THE COUNTY -- AND WITH THE STATE FUNDING LAST YEAR -- WE WERE ABLE TO FIND REGIONAL STREET OUT REACH FOR THE ENTIRE SELL SPA SO WE'RE ABLE TO KIND OF MAINTAIN A BY NAME LIST IN THE CITY'S ABOUT WHO IS -- IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND TARGETING THEM FOR THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE I JUST RECENTLY MET WITH MY MARES IN IT IT SEEMS LIKE SAN COMMITTEES WAITING ON THE U. TALK COURT DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD THEY'RE ALSO A LOT OF A LOT OF MY CITIES ARE THIRTY THOUSAND SAN JUAN DATA POINT TWO SMALL THAT THEY FEEL TO OPEN UP THEIR OWN FACILITY THEY LIKE TO COORDINATE WITH THE COUNTY ON ORIGINAL SO THERE'S TALK OF LAND LÀ PADA -- AT THE LANDFILL THERE'S ALL KINDS OF COUNTY PROPERTY THERE THERE'S A CALIFORNIA CON LOS PINOS SUB LIKELY CLEVELAND NATIONAL FOREST ITS STATE PROPERTY BUT OF VIEW IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYBODY'S TAKEN THE LEAD IN SOUTH COUNTY TO SAY WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE CHIEF AND WHAT'S HAPPENING UP HERE BUT A PARKING PLACENTIA SO I JUST BE CURIOUS IT IS OUR TIME LINE IS WHY DON'T I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC TIME LINE ON THAT BUT WOULD YOU KNOW WITH THIS YOUNG AFTER AFTER JUDGE CARTER THERE WAS A THERE WAS A IDEA THAT WAS DEAD ON ARRIVAL TO PUT A TEN CITY AT THE OLD COURTHOUSE LINDY AND LOGAN AND A GAL AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM WITH THAT BUT THAT'S THE ONLY IDEA THAT I'VE SEEN COME OUT FOR SOUTH COUNTY ONE FROM THE COUNTY'S PERSPECTIVE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CITIES ARE ON BOARD -- WITH WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS AN IN NORTH I MEAN IT'S BEEN A COLLABORATION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING -- IN CENTRAL WE'VE HAD LOTS OF INDIVIDUAL DIALOGUES AND IT'S NICE TO GET THE CITIES TO WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE AGAIN AS I SAID IF ONCE OPENING A SHELTER SOMEBODY ELSE IS GOING TO BE WORKING ON THE HOUSING PIECE AND WE NEED THE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT IN THE RECOVERY PROGRAM A WHERE'S THE EMPLOYMENT PIECE WE'VE GOT TO BE WORKING ON ALL OF THOSE COMPONENTS AND YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT THE APPETITE OF CITY COUNCILS IN NINE DIFFERENT CITIES -- YOU KNOW THEY ALL HAVE THE THE GOVERNMENT'S AUTHORITY FOR THEIR CITY WHAT DO THEY HAVE THE APPETITE TO CONTRIBUTE INTO THAT SYSTEM FROM THE COUNTY WE TALKED TO THE CITY'S A LOT ABOUT WHAT DO YOU HAVE AVAILABLE WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S FEASIBLE WHAT IS YOUR COUNSEL ON YOU KNOW WILLING TO DO AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A MUTUAL DIALOGUE AS I SAID IT'S A FIVE PLANES FLYING WE NEED ALL FIVE IT'S NOT EVEN JUST THE COUNTY OR THE CITIES IT'S THE CONSTITUENCIES AS WELL AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND COMMUNITY EDUCATION TO GET PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS BETTER TO RESPOND PROACTIVELY THAN RE ACTIVELY THANKS VERY MUCH YEAH CAN HELP AT ALL PLEASE THANK YOU SIR YOU ARE AT THE RIGHT PLACE TO HELP YOU COULD LEADS THOSE DISCUSSIONS ART BUT IF THERE IS A COUNTY SAYING LET'S PUT AMOUNT LOS PINOS THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION BECAUSE MATTER OF FACT I THINK THAT ALICE FOR SURPLUS LAND WE ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD ON THE COUNTY MEDIA BILLET COMMITTEE A FEW YEARS BACK LIKE FOR FIVE YEARS TO ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD WITH SELLING THAT PROPERTY BUT THOSE TYPE OF SCENARIOS WHERE PEOPLE SAY LET'S JUST GO AHEAD AND MOVE THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE THE TRUTH IS WE CAN'T SOLVE ORANGE COUNTY'S HOMELESSNESS ISSUE AND ONCE EVERY SINGLE CITY TAKES RESPONSIBILITY AND I SEE WE HAVE CYPRESS HERE JOHN PETE WE HAVE WHERE'S THE DISSIDENT -- CITIES WHO WILL HAVE A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE LIKE LOW COMMA ONE OF OUR SMALLER CITIES AND THEY'RE HERE THE ENTIRE TIME SO AND I'M NOT I DON'T KNOW ALL YOUR TREE AND HE'S WILLING TO HELP BUT LIKE I SAID BUT THEY WILLING THEY HAVE TO HELP ANY CAN'T BE WITH IT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM LIKE TO LIKE THE FORMER SOUTH COUNTY GPA AND FIND STILL TO TAKE IN IN SOUTH COUNTY THE DAY FOCUSED ON WORKING WITH IN THE SITUATION THAT THEY HAVE VERSUS LET'S SEND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE OKAY JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S REALLY LIKE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT TOUCH TONE FOR ME WHERE I CAN BE REALLY VERY CONGENIAL BUT DON'T PUT ONE ISSUE YOU HAVE IN ONE PART OF THE COUNTY ON TO ANOTHER BECAUSE THAT'S WHY FULLER TIM WE DRIVE DOWN LIMÓN STREET AND THERE'S TWENTY DIFFERENT HOMELESS ON EVERY STREET CORNER I'M NOT SAYING YOU ARE IT WAS IN MY POINT MY MIND SOUTH COUNTY WANT TO SOLVE AS FOR REGIONAL SO DATA POINTS AND LONG WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN A REGIONAL ACTION LIKE THEY'RE DOING UP HERE YEAH I HAVE A CLEANING AND PICKING UP ON ON THIS I THINK TENSION BETWEEN CITY RESPONSIBILITY IN COUNTY RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE I DO FEEL LIKE THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT ARE REALLY GETTING CAUGHT IN THIS CATCH TWENTY TWO BECAUSE FOR FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN I THINK THERE'S GONNA THREE LEGS OF THE STOOL IN THE FIRST IS POLITICAL WILL AND LEADERSHIP THE SECOND IS AN ACTUAL PLAN THEN THE THIRD IS RESOURCES AND FUNDING AND I DO THINK THERE ARE EXAMPLES IN THE COUNTY WHERE THERE ARE CITIES WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED POLITICAL WELL AND LEADERSHIP WHERE THEY DO HAVE A PLAN THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY RESOURCES ARE FUNDING AND THEY'RE FINDING THEMSELVES NOW CAUGHT HOLDING THE BAG FOR YOU BECAUSE MAYES EVER EXAMPLE THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO THEIR GENERAL FUND AND THEN ONE OTHER CITY SEE THAT THAT MAKES CITIES LIKE NEWPORT BEACH HUNTINGTON BEACH MISSION VIEJO DANA POINT SAN CLEMENTE THEY'RE EVEN LESS LIKELY TO WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A SOLUTION WHEN THEY GO OH MY GOD I'M GONNA I'M GONNA PUT MY NECK ON THE LINE FROM MY FROM MY CONSTITUENTS I'M GONNA MOVE FORWARD ON THIS PLAN AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE A GIANT HOLE IN MY GENERAL FUND THAT NO ONE'S FELLING SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT THAT RATE FORMULA AND MAKE SURE THAT CITIES BACK TO THE CITY MANAGER'S POINT THAT CITIES THAT ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING ARE GETTING REWARDED ONE ABSOLUTELY I WOULD SENTIMENT AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COSTA MESA -- YOU KNOW THERE INITIATIVE WAS ON THE HEELS AND TO THE TAIL END OF WHEN THE FIRST ROUND OF HE CAME AND THEY MISSED THAT THEY JUST MISSED THAT COMPLETELY AND YOU KNOW THAT OPPORTUNITY THE WAY THAT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE BOARD WAS ALLOCATING THAT MONEY WAS REALLY NOT ALLOCATING IT BUT PARKING IT IN NORTH PARKING IN CENTRAL PARKING IN SOUTH AND SAYING EVERYONE HAS ACCESS EVERYONE SHOULD APPLY -- AND I THINK IN THE FIRST WHEN YOU HAD TO CALL THE SHELTER CRISIS AND THAT THERE WERE ONLY SIX THEY DID AND IT WAS THE SIX THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING SHELTERS ARE WE'RE GETTING DIRECT FUNDING YELL SANTA ANA ANAHEIM AND CENTURY IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE THE ALLERGEN ALSO HAD TO DO THAT AND THAT IS NOT AN EASY AS AN ELECTED LEADER OF A LOCAL BODY TO SAY WE HAVE A SHELTERS CRISIS AND THERE WERE SOME CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT DELIBERATELY CHOSE NOT TO DO THAT FOR WHATEVER THE REASON SO NOW TO THEN COME BACK AND SAY WELL SEE WE DON'T GET THAT THEY'RE THERE IT'S IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE LET IT AND SOME PEOPLE ARE THERE IN THE MIDDLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE KIND OF COMING INTO THE GAME WE WANT EVERYBODY TO BE SUCCESSFUL I DO BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE DUMPING AND I'VE SEEN THAT TOO MUCH SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR LAST PANELS AND THEN OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS BUT TOBY HAS BEEN -- YOU LEAN VERY PATIENT AND AND HERE HE IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AND HE ACTUALLY DID COME INTO A NOR SPOT A WHILE BACK AND SPEAK TO ALMOST TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WE HAD THERE AND WE APPRECIATED THAT SO THANK YOU AND WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AS YOU MENTIONED I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMISSION VERY BRIEFLY WERE AND A STATE AGENCY ONE OVERSIGHT BODY ON MENTAL HEALTH I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED BEFORE ASSEMBLY ACCOUNTABILITY AND IF EVER YOU COMMITTEE YOU FOR THAT I I THINK THE THE CONVERSATION YOU HAD TODAY REALLY TOUCHES ON MANY OF THESE KEY POINTS I LOVE THE COMMENT ABOUT LEADERSHIP A PLAN IN THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT WHAT WE FIND WORK LOOKING AROUND THE STATE IS THAT THERE ARE STRATEGIES AROUND CALIFORNIA ON THAT TOUCH UPON IS THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY AROUND HOUSING AND HOUSING STOCK AROUND THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES AROUND MAXIMIZING ACCESS TO BENEFITS THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE BE THAT A STATE OR FEDERAL BENEFITS IN TERMS OF THE ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EITHER HOMELESS AT RISK OF HOMELESS OR ON THAT WHAT WE MIGHT CALL ON THE PRECIPICE PARTICULARLY CHILDREN COMING OUT OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM OR FOLKS WHO WE KNOW WHO ARE DISCHARGING FROM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM I THINK IT FROM THE COMMISSION'S PERSPECTIVE THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE CANNOT FIND OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM TO A HOMELESS RESPONSE STRATEGY WE HAVE TO LOOK UPSTREAM WE HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE CORD DRIVER SOME OF WHICH YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY BUT I I I DO THINK THAT WHILE WE SEE EXAMPLES ACROSS THE STATE OF EFFORTS TO MAKE ALL OF THESE PIECES FIT TOGETHER AT THE BLUE ANGELS MODEL WE DON'T SEE THIS AT A AT A SYSTEM LEVEL IN ANY PARTICULAR LOCATION IN CALIFORNIA OTHER WORDS THERE'S NOBODY IS DOING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN AND I WILL AND I WOULD I WOULD ADD TO YOUR LIST BECAUSE I THINK YOU HAVE A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE LIST AT THE MOMENT AND AND AND INTEREST OF TIME RATHER THAN REITERATING ALL OF THOSE THINGS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU THE ONE THING I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT TODAY AMONG THE PANELISTS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE NOT LEVERAGING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS EXTENSIVELY AS WE COULD THE TICKET EARLY FEDERAL ENTITLEMENTS WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB MAKING IT EASIER FOR THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TO WORK IN OTHER WORDS THE BLUE ANGELS NEED TO BE ABLE TO FLY IN UNISON I'LL BORROW THE THE EXAMPLE UNFORTUNATELY THE PLANES ARE ALL DIFFERENT SIZES DIFFERENT AGES THEY FLY DIFFERENT SPEEDS THEY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ALL THESE SORT OF CHALLENGES THAT REALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO LINE UP WITH EACH OTHER THAT HAS TO DO WITH ALL OF THE ASPECTS THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT LAND USE PLANNING IT HAS TO DO WITH BUILDING AND CITING IT HAS TO DO WITH EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT EVEN SUPPORTING PEOPLE TO GET ENROLLED IN MEDICAID MEDICARE HOW PROGRAMS AND ENSURING THAT THE DOLLARS ARE AVAILABLE WE SEE DRAMATIC DISPARITIES IN THE ABILITY OF PUBLIC AGENCIES TO DRIVE DOWN FEDERAL DOLLARS AND THOSE DISPARITIES CAN'T BE EXPLAINED AWAY BY PREFERENCES IN TERMS OF THINGS LIKE HOW MANY DOLLARS LOCAL DOLLARS COUNTIES PUT INTO NON REIMBURSABLE PROGRAMS LIKE PREVENTION PROGRAMS VERSUS PROGRAMS THAT ARE REIMBURSABLE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TODAY FOR THE SYSTEM TO WORK AS YOU WANT IT TO WORK AND ONE OF THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS RELATIVE TO THAT IS WE HAVE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL VERY DIFFICULT TO FOR A COUNTY TO KNOW WHERE TO TURN THE COMMENT WAS MADE EARLIER ABOUT LOOKING AT PHOENIX OR LOOKING AT A PEOPLE OFTEN MENTION HAVEN FOR HOPE IN SAN ANTONIO THE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR OWN BACKYARD ORANGE COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY ARE EACH USING AND IT TO SAY DOLLARS IN THE CASE OF ORANGE COUNTY IT'S BE WELL TO TRY VERY CREATIVE APPROACHES OF END OF IT INTEGRATED CARE THAT REDUCE THE LAW THAT LEVEL OF BARRIERS THAT PEOPLE FACE WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO ACCESS SERVICES IS A VERY INTERESTING COMPONENT TO THAT ON FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE BENEFITS ON THE COMMERCIAL PAYER SIDE NOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE CAMPING ON YOUR STREETS TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE AT RISK OF EARLY PSYCHOSIS FOR EXAMPLE CURRENTLY WE HAVE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE THIS PROGRAMS ARE IN ORANGE COUNTY WE COULD FIGURE THAT OUT BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE STATEWIDE TODAY TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO BUILD OUT THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND FOR THE FOLKS WHO ARE ON YOUR STREETS WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH NEED THOSE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WE STARTED SIX MONTHS AGO TO BUILD OUT HEALTHCARE LEARNING COLLABORATIVE HONORABLY PSYCHOSIS WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE IT TO SCALE THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT THE GOVERNOR AGREED -- WERE REALLY WORKING TO PULL THOSE COUNTIES TOGETHER THAT'S ONE PIECE AS A SLIVER OF THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAVE IN IN YOUR COMMUNITIES RELATED TO THE DIFFICULT TO SERVE HOMELESS POPULATION IN IN IN THIS COMMUNITY AND IT'S TRUE THROUGHOUT THE STATE SIMILARLY ON THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DIVERSION OPPORTUNITY I AM I AM STRUCK BY THE COMMENTS AROUND FOLKS WHO ARE RESISTANT TO SERVICES WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT RESISTANCE IS THERE SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF PSYCHOSIS THAT SOMEONE HAS IS THERE REALLY NOT ENGAGING BUT THEY MAY NOT BE AT THAT POINT WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN MOVE FORWARD AND INVOLUNTARILY COMMIT SOMEONE WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE HEAVILY RESISTANT TO ACCESSING SERVICES THERE WAS A RECENT CONVERSATION IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ABOUT IT A TEMPORARY SHELTER PROGRAM AND THERE WAS A FUNDAMENTAL MISMATCH BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE NEEDED IN ORDER TO STAY IN THAT SHELTON WHAT THE SHELTER OFFERED SO PEOPLE FELT LIKE THEY WERE BETTER OFF CAMPING IN THE WOODS WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE DESIGN OUR SYSTEMS TO BE RESPONSIVE TO WEAR LR THE TICKET EARLY PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE PRECIPICE OF ENTERING INTO THE POPULATION THAT YOU'RE MOSTLY TRYING TO ADDRESS INCLUDING THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE COMING OUT OF YOUR JAILS YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE THERE IN YOUR CARE THAT A CHIEF OF POLICE AND OTHERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE BELIEVE IT WAS ACTUALLY RICHARD SANCHEZ TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF USING I MEANT TO SAY FUNDS IN YOUR JAIL FOR THE RIGHT KINDS OF SERVICES PLAY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A PRE ADJUDICATION STATUS RIGHT WE WE HAVE LOST THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THOSE FOLKS AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE PEOPLE PARTICULARLY IF THEY WERE HOMELESS BEFORE THEY ENTERED YOUR JAIL AT A VERY HIGH RISK OF COMING OUT -- CHILD WELFARE FAMILIES INVOLVED THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AS WELL IT IN IN NEW YORK THERE WAS A AN EXAMPLE OF A PROGRAM THAT WAS REFERRED TO AS A HOMELESS PREDICTOR SYSTEM ALMOST AS PREDICTORS SYSTEM AND IT WAS VERY ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE THEY SIMPLY REQUIRED LANDLORDS TO NOTIFY THE CITY OF INNOVATION BEFORE IT HAPPENED AND THE IDEA WAS TO HELP THAT FAMILY WITH THAT DEPOSIT WITH THAT TRANSITION BEFORE THEY WERE EVICTED IT'S MUCH CHEAPER TO KEEP A FAMILY INTACT TRANSITION THEM INTO AN ALTERNATE HOUSING PROGRAM THAN TO HAVE THAT FAMILY GET DISBURSED BECAUSE SHELTER DOESN'T ALLOW MOM AND DAD AND CHILDREN OR THE PATS OR IN PARTICULAR THE CASE A MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILY SO I BOTTOM LINE I WOULD SAY THAT WE REALLY NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE SYSTEM WE'VE DESIGNED IS VERY DISTRIBUTED CITIES HAVE A ROLE COUNTIES HAVE A ROLE YOUR SPECIAL DISTRICTS HAVE A ROLE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE A ROLE PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK IN THE STATE AND THE FEDS ARE ALSO HAVE A ROLE BUT WHAT WE WHAT WE'VE DONE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE STATE IS ENCOURAGE THOSE INDIVIDUAL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO FIGURE THIS OUT ON THEIR OWN WITH A MISHMASH OF LONG TERM FUNDS ONE TIME DOLLARS GRAND DOLLARS -- AND WE'VE MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM FOR FOR YOU OFFER LOCAL AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY THAT THE KEY INVESTMENT THE KEY OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THE RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS ON THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT THAT CAN BE AVAILABLE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN MOVE DOLLARS FROM REACTIVE HI COSTS LOW VALUE TO PREVENTATIVE LOW COST HIGH VALUE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN ACROSS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THOUSANDS OF CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AT THE STATE LEVEL TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF OUR LOCAL AGENCIES TO RETAIN THEIR NEED TO TAILOR THEIR STRATEGY TO THEIR UNIQUE SITUATIONS WHETHER IT'S YOUR RESOURCES YOUR GEOGRAPHY YOUR DEMOGRAPHICS SO YOUR SERVICE MAX WELL ALSO CARVING THE PATH FORWARD IN TERMS OF AGAIN LEADERSHIP THE PLAN IN THE RESOURCE BASE WE WE HAVE WE'VE BEGUN TO DO THIS AGAIN I USED EARLY PSYCHOSIS EXAMPLE THE COMMISSION IS SUPPORTING COUNTIES IN THINKING IT REALLY UNDERSTANDING CRIMINAL JUSTICE DIVERSION HOW DO WE MOVE FOLKS UPSTREAM RESEARCH FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS HAS FOUND THAT FORTY SIX PERCENT OF PEOPLE COMING INTO THEIR STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM WITH A FELONY CHARGE AND VERY SERIOUSLY ILL BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN DEEMED COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL FORTY SIX PERCENT HAD NO COMMUNITY SERVICES SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FELONY ARREST THEY'RE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS WERE WORKING TO SUPPORT COUNTIES TO DO THE DATA ANALYTICS THAT THEY NEED TO DO TO UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE CRACKS ARE THERE AND HOW THEY CAN STOP THOSE PEOPLE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS SIMILARLY WERE USING IMAGES A INNOVATION FUNDS TO SUPPORT STRATEGIES LIKE USING PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES TO PREVENT THE NEED TO CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE TO SLOW DOWN REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE SERVICE DELIVERY STRATEGY THAT COUNTY HAS IN PLACE FALLS APART WHEN SOMEONE IS STRESSED HOW CAN WE AGAIN LOOK AROUND THE CORNER AND ANTICIPATE WHO THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE AND PUT A PLAN IN PLACE MUCH LIKE WE DO WITH OLDER FOLKS WHO ARE MOVING OUT OF THEIR HOMES INTO SOME SORT OF AN ASSISTED LIVING KIND OF PLAN IS THAT WE TALK WITH OUR OLDER RESIDENTS ABOUT WHAT COMES NEXT WE OFTEN DON'T TALK WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OUR SYSTEM TODAY AGAIN TELL WELL FAIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE STATE HOSPITAL OTHER KINDS OF PROGRAMS ABOUT LOOKING AROUND THE CORNER WHAT WE DO IS WE RELEASE WE MOVE THEM FROM ONE PROGRAM TO THE NEXT AND WHEN AND WHEN THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION AND THE SYSTEM FAILS YOU END UP IN HAVING THESE VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HIGH COST IMPACT VERY REACTIVE CARE AND SO I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THAT SELECT COMMITTEE TO THINK ABOUT HOW CAN THE STATE HOW CAN OUR PARTNERS IN ACADEMIA ON THE RESEARCH SIDE HOW CAN WE BEGIN TO BRING TOGETHER THE EXPERTISE THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING EXPERTISE THAT YOU HAVE HERE IN YOUR COMMUNITIES TO TALK ABOUT STRATEGIES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND HARDER FOR YOU TO FAIL BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY EASY TO FAIL AS YOU KNOW AND SUCCESS AS THE FOLKS TO MY LEFT NOW IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO BE HERE THE COMMISSION OF A LOVE TO HELP YOU WITH THAT -- WE'VE SEEN SOME SUCCESS IN BRING FOLKS TOGETHER IN THIS WAY AND AND I THINK THIS EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARD TODAY IS THIS IS WHAT IS NEEDED IN TERMS OF ALL OF THESE COMPLICATED PIECES THAT COME TOGETHER TO RESULT IN THE CHALLENGER TRYING TO ADDRESS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I THINK THAT YOUR COMMENTS CAME EXACTLY AT THE RIGHT TIME OF THE HEARING WHICH IS THAT -- WE ALL HAVE EXPERIENCES WITH SUCCESS AND FAILURE WITHIN THE SYSTEM OF HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND IT CAN GET VERY QUICKLY A MOTIONAL SO I APOLOGIZE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BILL GROWING KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING HARD IN YOUR AREA -- BUT I I THINK THAT IS FOR ME PERSONALLY WHERE I GET REALLY DO THE BEST THAT I KNOW ON A VERY UNEMOTIONAL WAY WHICH IS WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EMOTIONAL PART AND YOU SEE HOW MANY FAILURES THERE ARE OUT THERE AND THEN YOU ATTACH IT TO PEOPLE YOU EVEN KNOW IS THEN BECOMES AN URGENT KIND OF CRY THAT HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WE HAVE TO LOSE HUNDRED PEOPLE LAST YEAR DIED NOW ON THE STREETS OF ORANGE COUNTY WE DON'T KNOW THAT THOSE WERE ALL BECAUSE OF I'M NOT GETTING ATTENTION MAYBE AS WAS SAID THEY DECLINED IT BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON THOSE NUMBERS ARE UP ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I DO FEEL IT'S A MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE RESPOND BUT I THINK WHAT YEAR YOUR LAST REMARK SPENT IS LET'S RESPOND EFFECTIVELY IN THAT SOMETHING WE CAN ALL ANYTHING GAIN FROM THIS SO WITH THAT I THINK IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING REMARKS THAT WAY THEY HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN WHAT WE DO IS COULD PROBABLY KEEP THOSE COMMENTS TO ABOUT ONE MINUTE IF YOU -- BUT MEMBERS ANY FINAL COMMENTS JUST VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT WE'RE RUNNING TRÊN TIME BUT THERE IS A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT YOU SAID THAT THAT REALLY STRUCK ME I THINK YOU'RE A THAT WE WITH THE STATE YOU ARE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE HERE IS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR OUR PARTNERS IN THE COUNTY AND THE IN STATE GOVERNMENT TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK FOR US TO DO ON THAT FRONT AND I CAN YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF LEVERAGING FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT SO THERE'S ARE BOTH THINGS THAT I WOULD LOVE US TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP ON OUR COMMUNITY AND AND WE ARE DEFINITELY MISSING THAT REPRESENTATION HERE SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE ALL WORK TO ENGAGE OUR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL ON AT THE FEDERAL YES I'M A NUMBER THANKS AGAIN I'M CHAIR FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING SO I COME AT THIS YOU KNOW I'M OF THAT -- AND PRESIDENT BUSH APPOINTED ME TO THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ONE THE FIRST THING I DID IS I WENT OUT WITH A HOMELESS ADVOCATE TO GO TO SOUP KITCHENS AND SHELTERS TRYING TO FIND VETERANS AND SPEND A DAY DOING THAT WITH WITH THE GENTLEMAN AND IT GOES BACK TO THE SERVICES THE VA'S GOT EVERY SERVICE AVAILABLE DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELING HOUSING JOB TRAINING BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE THE PEOPLE TAKE IT NOW WAS TO TAKE AWAY FROM THAT TO YOU WE MAINLY ONE OUT AND WE HANDED OUT ARMY SURPLUS SLEEPING BAGS AND BOOT SO PEOPLE BECOME TO WE DID TAKE ONE GENTLEMAN IN FOR HEALTH CARE BUT IT'S IT'S FINDING A WAY TO MAKE THE FOLKS TAKE TO SERVICES AND SO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ADDED SINCE THEN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF HOMES WERE VETERANS AT THE TIME MY LAST YEAR ON DANA POINT CITY COUNCIL YOU KNOW WE KNEW THE THIRTY PEOPLE IN DANA POINT THAT WERE HOMELESS -- THE DEPUTIES KNOWN WE KNEW HOW TO MANAGE -- BUT MY LAST YEAR SOME CHANGE WHERE PEOPLE WERE STANDING ON THE STREET CORNER WERE SIGNS DAY GETTING IN AN CONGREGATING AND SO I ASKED FOR HOMELESS TASK FORCE AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT IT'S LIKE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES DID YOU KNOW WE PUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ON THEIR FAMILY ASSISTANCE MINISTRIES THE VFW YOU KNOW SO THE DEPUTY WOULD ENCOUNTER SOMEBODY YOU KNOW WE CAN AT LEAST BE THE MIDDLE MAN TO TRY TO GET HIM SERVICES THEY NEED BUT EVEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IT'S EXPLODED WAY BEYOND THAT AND -- SO I JUST WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER IT IS A HUGE ISSUE WE'RE ALL WORKING ON IT AND -- WE GOT TO COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS FOR THE BETTERMENT OF OUR OUR CITIZENS BUT ALSO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS AND WE GET ON THE CARE THAT THEY NEED SO THANKS AGAIN FOR FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING AN IT JUST ONE VERY QUICK RESPONSE TO THAT IN A FORMER POSITION I LIST ADDRESS THE STATE'S RESEARCH BUREAU WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S DRAWDOWN OF FEDERAL VA BENEFITS PENSIONS RETIREMENTS AND CASH PAYMENTS RELATIVE TO OTHER STATES AT THE TIME WE WERE IN THE FORTIES FOR FRANK FORTIETH IN THE BACK OF THE ENVELOPE CALCULATION OF CALIFORNIA WERE TO MOVE COMPARABLE TO FLORIDA AND TEXAS AND DRAWING DOWN FEDERAL ENTITLEMENTS FOR FOR BATS WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ADDITIONAL BILLION DOLLARS IN THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY NOT MONEY THAT GOES INTO STATE COFFERS ARE COUNTY COFFERS IT'S MONEY THAT GOES TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED TO PAY RANT BY WASHERS AND DRYERS PURCHASE A CAR SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BECAUSE THE VA'S MANDATED BASED OFF THE POPULATION WHOSE AND ROLLED TO BUILD MORE CLINICS AND HOSPITALS AND WE'LL GET THOSE RESOURCES IN HERE SO EVEN IF A NUMBER WAS NINE PERCENT I BELIEVE YOU SAID WAS MINUTES NINE PERCENT WE TAKE OFF THE TABLE THAT THE VA COULD HANDLE AND THEN WE CAN FOCUS ON THE OTHER EIGHTY ONE BUT THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT POINT AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIG REVEAL NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF JUST COMING FROM LOCAL TO STATE BUT I THINK FOR MANY OF US IS UNDERSTANDING THE RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND HOW DO WE ATTAIN THEM AND I THINK IT'S AN EDUCATION THAT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE BETTER AT IT ORANGE COUNTY AS A WHOLE BUT ALL TOO OFTEN I WOULD HEAR WILL ORANGE COUNTY IS NOT GETTING THEIR FAIR SHARE WHICH WAS JUST KIND OF A CONSTANT AND WE IN FACT LOOKED AND DID SOME RESEARCH ON WE CAN'T GET OUR FAIR SHARE IF WE DON'T APPLY FOR THE FUNDING OR FOR NOT IN THE GAME AND SO SOME OF OUR RESEARCH SHOWED THAT IN FACT WE HAVEN'T BEEN AS AGGRESSIVE AS WE COULD BE OR SHOULD BE ON MULTIPLE FRONTS OF FUNDING AND SO AS THIS LAST YEAR OR SO HAS MOVE FORWARD I THINK WE ARE STARTING TO SEE GO AFTER THE MONEY OUT WE MAY NOT ALWAYS WIN BUT WE CAN'T COMPLAIN IF WE DIDN'T EVEN APPLY IN THEN WE CAN WORK ON THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND MAKING IT A LITTLE BIT MORE CENTRALIZED AND SO FORTH ALL RIGHT SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO HAS ATTENDED A PLEASE GIVE US YOUR INFORMATION IF YOU'D LIKE TO BE ALERTED TO OTHER TYPE OF EVENTS WERE HAVING AND -- WE WILL CLOSE THE PANELISTS PART AND LET PEOPLE LEAVE WHO WOULD LIKE TO AND THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS US I WILL BE HERE AND WE WILL BE ON PUBLIC -- RECORDED A YOU MAY JUST LINE UP AT THE MIKE YEAH THANK YOU MY ASSEMBLYMAN ASSEMBLY WOMAN SHARON QUIRK SILVA -- MY NAME IS MARGARET

COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE ARE VERY VERY EAGER TO PARTNER WITH OUR CITIES AND OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS FOR OUR STUDENTS AND I A FEW PEOPLE TALK

COMMUNITY STUDENT COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE POOR BUT MANY OF THEM ARE AND WE ARE EDUCATING THE FUTURE AND THEY LITERALLY CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO SCHOOL AND TO LIVE IN ORANGE COUNTY ANYMORE AND SO WE ARE

MENTION COOKS UP A MY NAME IS LAUREN AMERICA'S AND I'M A STUDENT AT CAL STATE FULLERTON I'M STANDING POLITICAL SCIENCE AND I VERY QUICKLY WANTED TO ADDRESS -- TWO THINGS THAT IN MY OPINION WE'RE KIND OF BY PASS I'M TODAY AT THE FIRST BEING WE REALLY FOCUSED CRIMINALIZATION AND ALSO MENTAL HEALTH WE FORGOT TO FOCUS ON A LOT OF JUST ORDINARY CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE HERE TODAY WE LIVE OFF OF FIXED INCOME AND CALIFORNIA UNLIKE ANY OTHER STATE BESIDES FLORIDA AND NEW YORK ARE MEDIAN INCOME AS MENTIONED VERY BRIEFLY IS THIRTY FIFTY PERCENT OF WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE MAKING AND STATISTICALLY ONE SAYS MEDIAN INCOME SURPASSES THIRTY PERCENT WE SEE A SIPS OF BRENDA'S HER A RISE IN HOMELESSNESS AND I THINK WE CAN IT GREATLY -- ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE BY PASSING THE LEGISLATION REGARDING MEDIAN INCOME AND THAT IS GOING TO REALLY HELP PREVENT HOMELESSNESS FROM THE SIDE OF ORDINARY CONSTITUENTS -- WHO ARE ON FIXED INCOME SECONDLY THING I WANTED TO ADDRESS -- IS THIS WE STILL HAVE THIS NEGATIVE CONNOTATION AYE AYE AND I KIND OF EVEN SEE IT FROM THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE BEING ASKED -- HOW DO WE FORCE THESE HOMELESS PEOPLE TO GET HELP AND WE WE CAN'T FORCE THESE PEOPLE TO GET HELP WE HAVE TO THINK OF THESE THEY ARE PEOPLE AND WE CAN WE CAN WE TREAT THEM LIKE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS IT WOULD CRIMINALIZE THE HOMELESS AND WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE CONSTITUENTS SITE AND A LEGISLATIVE SIDE -- WE CAN'T FORCE THESE PEOPLE WE NEED TO BE MORE SYMPATHETIC AN ASTRAL A WHAT DO THEY NEED WATER WHAT ARE THESE WHAT ARE THEY SUFFERING AND WE JUST AS THIS IS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THAT THANK YOU HELLO I'M PAT DAVIS I LIVE IN ANAHEIM ALSO A PART OF HOUSING IS HUMAN RIGHT ORANGE COUNTY I'VE BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS SPENT MY WORKING CAREER AND HIGHER ED AND I SEE WHERE THESE TWO ISSUES TO COME TOGETHER I WANTED TO DRAW TO THE ISSUES THAT MICHELLE BROUGHT UP IN OTHERS THAT ZONING ISSUES AND LAND USE I THINK ARE THE PRIMARY WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE CAN HOLD CITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR NOT TAKING SERIOUSLY THE ARENA NUMBERS THE BUILDING THAT GOES ON IS OFTEN MODERATE UPPER INCOME LOW IN VERY LOW ISN'T EVEN ON THE RADAR AND THEY BRAG ABOUT IT I'VE HEARD OUR OWN CITY PLANNER DEPARTMENT HEAD SPEAK TO WE DON'T TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY THAT WAS MOST TROUBLESOME NOR WOULD HE TAKE ANY QUESTIONS PART OF THE ISSUE WITH THE DIALOGUE -- IN ADDITION THERE WAS A LOT OF DEPTH AND WHAT WE HEARD TODAY THERE WAS ALSO SOME VERY OVER SIMPLISTIC QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS BOTH BY THOSE INFORMED AND OTHERS I THINK THE NOTION THAT A ONE DAY RELATIONSHIP CHANGES ANYTHING YOU SPOKE TO THAT QUITE WELL AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND ALSO THE NOTION THAT FORTY PERCENT THAT FRIGHTENS ME AS ADVOCATES YOU GIVE US THOSE MOTEL VOUCHERS AND WE'LL GET FOLKS AND MOTELS THANK YOU HI GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S MELISSA CHINCHILLA AND I'M HERE WITH ULTIMATE HEALTH SERVICES -- I'M A RESEARCHER WITH ULTIMATE HEALTH SERVICES FOCUSED ON HOMELESSNESS AND THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH A WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS LOOKING OUT LATINO HOMELESSNESS -- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONVENIENCE TODAY'S MEETING TO BRING UP SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES HERE THROUGHOUT ORANGE COUNTY POINT REGARDING SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER REGARDING SERVICE CONNECTION SO WE KNOW THAT A LACK OF SERVICE CONNECTION OFTEN POINTS OF BROKEN SOCIAL SYSTEM SO I WANT TO REALLY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING A DEEPER LOOK AT WHY INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT BE CONNECTING TO SERVICES FOR INSTANCE WE KNOW THAT ALSO MADE A LOT OF THE PATIENTS THAT WERE SEEN THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS HOMELESS BE BROUGHT UP CONCERNS REGARDING PUBLIC CHARGE -- I'M SURE YOU AS WELL AS OTHERS ARE AWARE OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO PUBLIC CHARGE AND THIS HAS LED TO A LOT OF SERVICES ENGAGEMENT AMONG NON CITIZENS AND MAKE STATUS HOUSEHOLDS ARE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STIGMA SOMETIMES REGARDING THE RECEIPT OF HOMELESS SERVICES SO THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING ALSO CONSIDER HARLEY SERVICES BEING FRAME POWER INDIVIDUALS BEING OUT EACH TO -- IS THE OUR REACH CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AN AYE LASTLY I JUST WANT TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE NEED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW SERVICES ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED WE KNOW THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO ENTRY INTO SHELTERS FOR INSTANCE -- THE ISSUE WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER WITH REGARDS TO FAMILY SEPARATION -- A LOT OF FEAR WITH REGARD TO ENTERING SHELTER SYSTEMS THE SHELTER AS BEING AN UNSAFE SPACE FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR SILVA AND -- THANK YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING THE SUPPORT DISCUSSION HERE TO ORANGE COUNTY JUST QUICKLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE THINGS YOU MENTION WHAT CAN WE DO IN SACRAMENTO -- WE TALKED ABOUT THE ALIGNMENT OF PROGRAMS ELEVEN THE FUNDING IS CRUCIAL EIGHT CD AND TELEVISION HAVE PROBABLY OVERS ON NOVEMBER TWENTY A DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE TO APPLY SEPARATELY SO STREAMLINED THE PROCESS I THINK IS CRUCIAL ALSO HAVING THE STATE HAVE A CONCRETE PLAN WE HEAR THE GOVERNOR SAYING THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HOW MANY OF THOSE HOMES ARE GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION I WOULD SAY TWO MILLION WE HEAR FROM OUR COMMUNITY THAT HOUSING IS BEING BUILT BUT IT'S NOT HOUSING THAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD WE NEED TARGETED HOUSING THAT IS GOING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES HEARING AND ORANGE COUNTY AND AT THE STATE LEVEL ALSO THE ISSUE OF FOR A LOCAL FUNDING SOURCES COME OUT TO HELP LOCAL CITIES AND I WOULD JUST SAY ALSO I WOULD INVITE YOU AND OTHER FOLKS IN SACRAMENTO LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY AND ASK US WHAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THE STATE TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT WE DON'T HAVE A LOCAL FUNDING SOURCE HERE AS IS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE PRESENTATION BY MISS ANGLE THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE PUT HOUSING BONDS ON THE BALLOT TO BE ABLE TO APPROVE HOUSING IN AND TO FIND HOUSING LOCALLY -- THERE'S ALSO LOCAL HOUSING REQUIREMENTS THAT GO ON THAT AS WE HAVE A NOW ANALYZE A LAST PROGRESS REPORT FROM ALL THE CITIES THAT WENT UP TO EIGHT CITY IN APRIL -- UNDER HEALTHY ELEMENTS THERE'S OVER PRODUCTION ON MODERATE ABOUT MODERATE BUT THE LONG VERY LOW IS NOT BEING MET NOT EVEN A FRACTION OF IT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU AND -- FOR ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES HERE YOU SO MUCH I'LL JUST CLOSE MY WITH A VERY BRIEF COMMENTS IN THE SENSE THAT OF WHAT I'VE WILL TAKE AWAY FROM THIS BECAUSE AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW WATCHING THE LEGISLATURE MANY TIMES THINGS ARE BROUGHT TO US AND THEN WE VOTE ON THEM AND SAME THING WITH COUNCIL WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE CAPACITY WITHIN OUR SCHEDULES TO BECOME COMPLETELY ENGAGE AN ISSUE WHERE WE'RE LEARNING EVERY DAY AND TO BE HONEST THE MORE WE LEARN THE BETTER WE ARE AT OUR JOBS SO I TAKE THIS ISSUE VERY SERIOUSLY AND ONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO HAVE TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW HOUSING WE CANNOT TO AS WAS NOTED SHELTERS ARE A PART OF THE THE TEMPORARY SOLUTION BUT ANALYSTS WE BUILD HOUSING AND WE BUILD THE RIGHT TYPE OF HOUSING THAT -- IS NOT ONLY GOING TO COMPLEMENT THE CITY -- THAT IS HOSTING THE HOUSING BUT AFFORD WE WILL FIND OURSELVES HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION IN TEN YEARS AS I WAS ON A SKAGGS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS AND I WAS IN DEEPLY INVESTED IN HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION AND -- AND SOMEBODY WHO SERVED FAR LONGER THAN I AM THE MAYOR HERE ARE BROWN WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT RAIN AND NUMBERS AND HOW DO WE NOT ONLY BUILD THAT BUILD SO THAT FAMILIES CAN AFFORD AND WHERE I CAN GET VERY TESTY IS WHEN WE HAVE -- SOME ELECTED BODIES THAT WILL LOOK AT EVERY WAY NOT TO DO WHAT IS PRESENTED TO THEM WHETHER IT'S THROUGH LITIGATION WHETHER IT'S THROUGH IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM SOMEBODY ELSE'S AND THAT BECOMES AN ISSUE THAT WE ALL DEAL WITH SO -- I'D LIKE TO END ON A POSITIVE NOTE I DO SEE OPTIMISM OUT THERE ARE SO AND -- YOU SAW SEVERAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WERE PUT FORWARD -- SOME OF THOSE HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET AS JANUARY ONE WILL BE THE DATE SOME OF THIS WILL BEGAN A ONE THING THAT WE DID NOT TALK ABOUT AT ALL THAT I FELT WAS A BRIGHT SPOT IN THE STATE WAS AD USE OR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND THAT TO IS USING EXISTING LAND RESIDENTIAL HOMES WITHIN A CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT THEY MEET TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY ON BUILDING NOW AS WE SAID EARLIER BECAUSE I'M SEEING THE ANAHEIM MAYOR HERE IS SOMETIMES ONE THING LEADS TO UNDERTAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE WHICH COULD BE PARKING ISSUES AND SO FORTH BUT IF WE CAN USE -- LAND BUT TO NOW HOW IS OTHER PEOPLE THAT IS THE CHOICE THERE IS MORE FLEXIBILITY NOW WITH THOSE BILLS SO IF YOU'RE REALLY INTO THAT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT LOOK THOSE UP -- SECONDLY IS SURPLUS LAND THE STATE HAS SURPLUS LAND WE HAVE MANY ACRES OF SURPLUS LAND AND MATTER OF FACT WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS UP AND TELL A GOOD HANDFUL OF YEARS AGO OF OF NOT GIVING IT AWAY BUT TAKING THE RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE STATE AND MOVING IT TO ANOTHER ENTITY WHETHER IT BE A COLLEGE OR A COUNTY NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN WE REALIZE WELL THIS IS VERY VALUABLE SO WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN ACRES OF COUNTY LAND WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE FAIRVIEW LAND IN WE ARE GOING TO LOOK FORWARD AND I'M GOING TO BE RELENTLESS ABOUT CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES AND WE CANNOT WALK AWAY SO MENTAL HEALTH IS ONE TYPE OF HOUSING THERE'S ALSO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE THERE'S DISABLED HEALTH AND WITH A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN ACRES THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF POSSIBILITIES BUT IT TAKES THE WILL IT TAKES THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ONLY LEADING BUT THAT ARE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO STOP FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP SO WITH THAT WE WILL CLOSE THIS HEARING AND ALWAYS HOPE YOU STAY ENGAGED IN THIS AND WE THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR TIME THREE HOURS THANK YOU SO MUCH
