RIGHT TIME AT THE RIGHT TIME WAS

PROBABLY TWENTY YEARS AGO- THERE

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:03.797
THE REALITY IS THAT- WE HAVEN'T

01:40:03.864 --> 01:40:05.132
DONE ENOUGH TO PROTECT OUR

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:06.500

01:40:10.037 --> 01:40:12.172
APPLIES TO STATE PROCUREMENT I'M

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:14.508
NOT UP BY HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND

01:40:14.575 --> 01:40:17.711
WHAT HAVE YOU SO- IT'S THE THAT

01:40:17.778 --> 01:40:19.747

BY. OTHER WITNESSES- THAT THAT

01:40:22.616 --> 01:40:24.385
SPOKE BEFORE YOU ARRIVED. WE ARE

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:29.957

BROADER THAN. WELL I WOULD LOVE

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:38.532
TO HAVE A BROADER REDUCTION

01:40:38.599 --> 01:40:39.500
NARROWED IT BASED UPON

01:40:39.566 --> 01:40:41.435
OPPOSITION CONCERNS- BUT AND

01:40:41.502 --> 01:40:43.570
THAT'S WHY I WAS LITERALLY IN

01:40:43.637 --> 01:40:44.738
CANADA IN OCTOBER AND THEY WERE

01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:46.974
VERY GRATEFUL- THE MOVE BOREEL

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:47.574
FOREST AND REMOVE THEIR

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:50.010
OPPOSITION. AND SO- IT'S

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:52.579
ACTUALLY MORE NARROW BECAUSE OF

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:54.915
CONCERNS RAISED BY FROM- PRIVATE

01:40:54.982 --> 01:40:56.617
INDUSTRY AS WELL AS OTHER

01:40:56.683 --> 01:40:58.285
GOVERNMENTS THEY BY THAT OUR

01:40:58.352 --> 01:41:00.120
GRIEF WE'VE NARROWED IT- BECAUSE

01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:01.789
OF THE CURRENT CHALLENGES IN

01:41:01.855 --> 01:41:05.492
OPPOSITION THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:06.827
THE RIGHT TIME. WELL WHAT WE'RE

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:08.362
DOING IS WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:10.364
TROPICAL FORESTS. AND WE WILL

01:41:10.431 --> 01:41:12.499
REMOVE THE BOREAL FORESTS. AND

01:41:12.566 --> 01:41:13.901
SO IF YOUR SUGGESTION IS THAT

01:41:13.967 --> 01:41:15.169
WHENEVER WE RECEIVE OPPOSITION

01:41:15.235 --> 01:41:17.471
THAT IS THE WRONG TIME FOR

01:41:17.538 --> 01:41:18.305
SOMETHING THAT WE WOULDN'T GET

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:19.740

OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE

01:41:34.621 --> 01:41:36.056

RULE MAKING IN LAWMAKING OCCURS

BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH I'M

02:02:39.351 --> 02:02:41.220

WITHIN THE REGULATORY PROCESS.

02:02:52.631 --> 02:02:55.668
AND SO WE THINK IT'S A COMMON

02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:57.069
SENSE BILL- TO IMPROVE THE TORY

02:02:57.136 --> 02:02:59.271
PROCESS THAT- THAT'S ONGOING

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:11.016
REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT

02:03:11.083 --> 02:03:14.587
SERENA IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST TO

02:03:14.653 --> 02:03:17.289
- SO- I WORK WITH CAPTAIN MITCH

02:03:17.356 --> 02:03:19.158
WAS CONSULTING I'VE- WORKED ON-

02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:20.793
ANALYZING MANY DIFFERENT

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:22.728
SERENA'S ANOTHER REGULATORY

02:03:22.795 --> 02:03:26.365
ACTIONS AND- I BELIEVE THAT AB

02:03:26.432 --> 02:03:26.999
TWENTY EIGHT NINETY THREE IS A

02:03:27.066 --> 02:03:28.734
GOOD GOVERNMENT BILL THAT

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:30.336
SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVES

02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:30.836
CALIFORNIA'S RULE MAKING

02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:33.239
PROCESS- YOU KNOW IF YOU KNOW

02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:34.507
THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

02:03:34.573 --> 02:03:36.509
ACT SETS FORTH A VERY DETAILED

02:03:36.575 --> 02:03:38.878
PROCESS. RULE MAKING AND THERE

02:03:38.944 --> 02:03:40.379
ARE MAJOR ROLES FOR ECONOMIC

02:03:40.446 --> 02:03:41.947
ANALYSIS ECONOMIC IMPACT

02:03:42.014 --> 02:03:45.084
ANALYSIS- AND MEANINGFUL PUBLIC

02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:47.119
PARTICIPATION AND THE OBJECTIVE

02:03:47.186 --> 02:03:49.989
OF THIS IS THAT THE RULE MAKING

02:03:50.055 --> 02:03:53.459
THE- REGULATION THAT IS ADOPTED.

02:03:53.526 --> 02:03:57.663
BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE- VERY MUCH

02:03:57.730 --> 02:04:00.866
CALL I THOUGHT I HAD A SURE OFF

02:04:00.933 --> 02:04:02.701
- I BELIEVE EFFECTIVE MOST COST

02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:05.437
EFFECTIVE OF ANY ALTERNATIVE-

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:08.174
REGULATORY PROCEDURE. AND SO THE

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:09.642
ACCESS FOR THE AMBITIOUS

02:04:09.708 --> 02:04:11.010
OBJECTIVES BUT THERE ARE SOME

02:04:11.076 --> 02:04:12.578
PROBLEMS WITH HOW IT HIS WORK IN

02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:14.613
PRACTICE AND I THINK PERHAPS THE

02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:17.216
BIGGEST PROBLEM. IS THAT THE US

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:21.153
REYES- COMPLETED PRIOR TO WIN

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:22.721
THE RULE THE DRAFT RULE IS

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:25.191
INTRODUCED AND OFTEN FAILS TO

02:04:25.257 --> 02:04:26.926
LOOK T ROBUST RANGES OF

02:04:26.992 --> 02:04:28.360
ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF ACHIEVING

02:04:28.427 --> 02:04:30.563
THE SAME OBJECTIVES. SO THE

02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:32.364
WHOLE PROCESS OF SORT OF FRONT

02:04:32.431 --> 02:04:34.133
LOADED AND- THE FOCUS IS NARROW

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.901
BEFORE THE PUBLIC COMBAT PERIOD

02:04:35.968 --> 02:04:37.970
BEGINS. AND SO IMPORTANTLY

02:04:38.037 --> 02:04:39.438
THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT IN

02:04:39.505 --> 02:04:41.974
CURRENT LAW THAT THE SU RIAS BE

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:44.910
UPDATED IF A PROPOSAL IS REVISED

02:04:44.977 --> 02:04:47.313
AND SO WHAT THAT TENDS TO DO IS

02:04:47.379 --> 02:04:49.114
IT LEAVES THE PUBLIC AND THE

02:04:49.181 --> 02:04:51.317
AGENCIES SORT OF IN THE DARK

02:04:51.383 --> 02:04:53.118
ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT SUB AND

02:04:53.185 --> 02:04:55.421
REVISIONS TO A REGULATORY A

02:04:55.487 --> 02:04:58.791

BILL ADDRESSES- THIS SHORTCOMING

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:03.162

REGULATIONS ARE MEANINGFULLY

02:05:05.764 --> 02:05:08.601
REVISED. AND IT GIVES A PUBLIC

02:05:08.667 --> 02:05:09.568
THIRTY DAYS INSTEAD OF THE

02:05:09.635 --> 02:05:10.970
CURRENT FIFTEEN DAYS TO HAVE

02:05:35.461 --> 02:05:37.496
ANALYSIS- THERE'S ALSO A

02:05:37.563 --> 02:05:38.964
PROVISION THAT REQUIRES ABOUT
