PIERRE THE FORGE WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES OKAY WILL BEGIN- WITH SENATOR ARCHER LET THE WELCOME. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. TODAY I'M PRESENTED SENATE BILL THIRTEEN NINETY THREE WHICH EEKS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH DECARBONISATION AND DECARBONISING CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING BUILDINGS BY REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE CERTAIN FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION BEFORE APPROVING ORDINANCES. THAT WOULD REQUIRE GAS APPLIANCES TO BE REPLACED WITH ELECTRIC APPLIANCES. SPECIFICALLY THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE THE ORDINANCE TO UNDERGO REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY THECALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES OT PROVIDE FOR EXEMPTIONS IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE REPLACING APPLIANCES WOULD BE TECHNICALLY INFEASIBLE OR WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CUSTOMERS. NO REVIEW WOULD BE REQUIRED HOWEVER IF SUCH EXEMPTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE ORDINANCE. WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING CARBONIZATION CALIFORNIA HAS LARGELY FOCUSED ON NEW CONSTRUCTION IN FACT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED WHAT ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS REACH COACH WHICH ARE LOCAL ENERGY ORDINANCES REQUIRING MORE STRINGENT ENERGY REQUIREMENTS THAN THOSE SET BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY. CODE THESE REACH COACH WHICH ADDRESS NEW CONSTRUCTION WOULD BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. WELL DECARBONISING NEW CONSTRUCTION IN CALIFORNIA IS IMPORTANT THE BIGGEST AREA OF OPPORTUNITY FOR BUILDING DECARBONIZATION IS CALIFORNIA'S NEARLY FOURTEEN MILLION HOMES AND SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. HOWEVER THERE ARE UNIQUE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH DECARBONISATION AND DECARBONISING EXISTING BUILDINGS COMPARED TO NEW BUILDINGS THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION RECENTLY IDENTIFIED COST AS MOST SIGNIFICANT BERRIER. ORDING TO THE COMMISSION AND ELECTRIC PANEL UPGRADE MAY COST BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS PAID FOR BY THE HOMEOWNER OR PROPERTY OWNER IN A SCENARIO IN WHICH EVERY HOUSE BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY REQUIRES AN ELECTRIC PANEL UPGRADE IT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. THIS DOES NOT EVEN INCLUDE THE COST OF THE APPLIANCE AND INSTALLATION. THESE COSTS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT LOWER INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THESE COMMUNITIES FACE ADDITIONAL UNIQUE BARRIERS BECAUSE OF THIS MEDIC. IN AT INEQUITY- HISTORY OF LOWER ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND FINANCING A GREATER ENERGY BURDEN AND LOWER RATES OF HOMES OR OR BUSINESS OWNERSHIP. AMONG OTHER BARRIERS TO BUILDING DECARBONIZATION THE COMMISSION ALSO IDENTIFIED WORKFORCE TRAINING FOR INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE PRACTICES. AS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BEGIN ADOPTING ORDINANCES TO ADDRESS EXISTING BUILDINGS CALIFORNIA LAW MUST BE UPDATED TO ENSURE THAT THESE IDENTIFIED CHALLENGES ARE CONSIDERED AN ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND IF NECESSARY AT THE STATE LEVEL BEFORE SUCH ORDINANCE MAY TAKE AFFECT. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES SENATE BILL THIRTEEN NINETY THREE WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO RE REQUIRE HOMEOWNERS AND BUSINESSES AND BUSINESS OWNERS YOU SWITCH THEIR APPLIANCES FROM GAS TO ELECTRIC TO CONSIDER ISSUES LIKE THAT THE CLOCK TICKED A TECHNICAL. FEASIBILITY TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY IMPACTS TO THE WORK FORCE AND IMPACTS TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THEN THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION WOULD NOT NEED TO REVIEW THE ORDINANCE. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. SOMETHING VERY CLEAR TO THE COMMITTEE. I BELIEVE THAT DECARBONIZATION AND DECARBONIZING CALIFORNIA'S BUILDING IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION EFFORTS I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE YOU THERE ARE EXTRAORDINARY YOUR CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WITH THIS. AND I WANT CAL TO BE SUCCESSFUL HOWEVER WE MUST ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FINANCIAL BURDEN TO OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THESE ORDINANCES WHICH IS WHY WE NEED THE STATE TO BE INVOLVED I HEAD OF THE ADOPTION. ORDINANCES FOR THAT REASON I BELIEVE THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY AND A ROLE TO PLAY IN ENSURING THAT CHART THAT THE TRANSITION TO T. TWO DECARBONISATION TO DECARBONISING BUILDINGS IS DONE LOGICALLY IN A RESPONSIBLE NOT PORTABLE WAY. TO THIS END I AM OPEN TO FEEDBACK FOR MY COLLEAGUES THE CHAIR AND I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO ANY ADDITIONAL- AMENDED GOING WITH THIS NOPE. AND I ASKED. FOR KERN CAN WORK SEVEN AND TO NEST. AND BUT IT WILL WORK FOR A PATH OF SUCCESS BY EVERYONE. WITH THIS THIS IMPORT BILL I HAVE A HARD. THE GOAL OF KELP YOU TOO BOYS. MS YOU HAVE TO THE A. O. SMITH CORP RISK AFTER I VOTE AND I YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS WILL BEGIN WITH ANTHONY'S BEFORE WE DO I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU TO CLARIFY YOUR COMMENTS THAT YOU ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS YES SIR OKAY VERY WELL UP THE WILL MOVE TO A SPEAKER IN SUPPORT MEN AND A HALF ANTHONY SAMPSON. AB ANTHONY SAMPSON HERE SAMPSON ADVISORS ON BEHALF OF A. O. SMITH CORPORATION. ALONG WITH ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES AO SMITH IS THE LARGEST MANUFACTURER AND SELLER OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL WATER HEATING EQUIPMENT INCLUDING ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP WATER HEATERS IN ALL OF NORTH AMERICA. A. O. SMITH SUPPORTS PRAGMATIC BUILDING DECARBONIZATION POLICIES THE COMPANY RECENTLY OUTLINED ITS VISIT ITS POSITION IN AN EMPIRICAL WHITE PAPER PUBLISHED IN SEPTEMBER WHICH I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH THIS COMMITTEE IF IT WOULD BE OF INTEREST. CONSISTENT WITH THE OPPOSITE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. A. O. SMITH SUPPORTS ALL NEW ELECTRIC RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION INCREASE FUNDING FOR ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP WATER HEATERS. THEY SUPPORTED SENATOR BACKERS SB SIXTY EIGHT AND MOST RECENTLY THERE IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. OVER TWO YEARS FOR CRITICAL INVENTS INVESTMENTS INEQUITABLE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION. TURNING TO THIS BILL SENATE ARCHULETA DID A GREAT JOB SUMMARIZING THE BILL SO I'D LIKE TO JUST FOCUS ON TWO POINTS. FIRST THE PERTINENT QUESTION FOR THE COMMITTEE AS IT RELATES TO THIS BILLS WHETHER THE STATE OUGHT TO PLAY SOME ROLE. TO HELP GUIDE THE LOCAL DECISION MAKING PROCESS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO REQUIRE RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL OWNERS TO SWITCH THEIR EXISTING APPLIANCES FROM GAS TO ELECTRIC. AS A SENATOR NOTICED NOTED THERE ARE UNIQUE AND SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH DECARBONISING EXISTING BUILDINGS AS OPPOSED TO NEW BUILDINGS. SO SB THIRTY NINETY THREE IS AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THOSE CHALLENGES ARE CONSIDERED. SECOND SB THIRTEEN NINETY THREE IS THE FIRST PIECE OF LEGISLATION SOLUTION PROPOSED IN CALIFORNIA. PERTAINING TO LOCAL ORDINANCES IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. THAT MEANS THERE IS NOT MUCH TO WORK OFF OF BY WAY OF PRESIDENT. WHICH IS WHY CAN REGENERATE THE SENATOR'S COMMENTS THAT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE IN TERMS OF WHAT ROLE THE STATION ANYWAY. THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE NOW TO- DO WHO DID YOU SAY WAS REPLACING SCOTT WHICH- CENTER ARCHULETA.

AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY THREE- ST ARCHULETA HAS OUTLINED ALL THE MANY OF THE BENEFITS- WE SEE TWO OTHER CRITICAL- INVALUABLE- PIECES OF THIS LEGISLATION FIRST AND FOREMOST IT'S AN EXTENSION. OF WHAT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION THE COMMISSION ALREADY DOES- FOR NEW- FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION EXTENDING INTO THIS EXISTING BUILT ENVIRONMENT- WHICH IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE DONE PROBABLY A FEW YEARS AGO SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL WE ALSO SUPPORTED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF. A NATURAL AND EFFECTIVE CONTRACTING OF THE GAS SYSTEM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CITIES COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERTISE TO DO THIS IN A WAY WHICH IS SAFE. RELIABLE FOR OUR MEMBERS PROVIDING THE SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC AND FOR THE CITIES AND CAT AND FOR ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY SO ON BEHALF OF. MY MEMBERS THE WORKERS AND THE PROVIDING OF THE SAFE RELIABLE GAS SERVICE AND THE PLAN DECARBONISATION OF EXISTING OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT- WE SUPPORT- S. B. THIRTEEN NINETY THREE THANK YOU. OKAY WELL NOW WE WILL MOVE TO SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT ANYONE HERE IN THE GALLERY. WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF FOR THOSE- BECAUSE OF CONSTRAINTS REGARDING LATE APPEARANCE TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS.

TO MANAGE INDIVIDUAL EXEMPTION. LOCAL ENERGY CODES A ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST SUCCESSFUL CLIMATE POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY MORE THAN FIFTY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR. THEY ALREADY REQUIRED TO BE COST EFFECTIVE TO PROTECT LOCAL CONSTITUENTS FROM LONG TERM RISING GAS PRICES AND PROVIDE A PATHWAY WILL DOWNSIZING THE JACKET THEM THE COST EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE MANNER. WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT THE STATE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY. BUT WE NEED THE STATE TO SUPPORT RATHER THAN JUST THAT FOR THE PRESIDENT RESTRICT THE TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL ENERGY TO CLEAN THE PORTABLE RENEWABLE HEAT AND HOT WATER. WE HAVE HAD HELPFUL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OFFICE OFFICE. I'M CONFIDENT AND OPEN TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION. BUT POINT AND BASED ON THE COMMON LANGUAGE WITH ELBOWS. THANK YOU.

OKAY THAT IS A COLOR IN SUPPORT WILL MAKE THE NOTE BUT WE'RE ON COLORS IN OPPOSITION OF YOUR COLOR IN OPPOSITION. MODERATOR PLEASE Q. ANY. OTHER CALLERS THERE ANY. THANK YOU I HAVE NO% FURTHER LINE THANK YOU OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH WILL COME NOW TO. THE COMMITTEE IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS OF WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS OR MOTIONS- SENATOR BAKER. CAN WE HAVE IS MIKE ACTIVATED. OKAY THANKS A PRETERISM JUST REMEMBER CITIES HAVE ENACTED REACH CODES TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS FROM BUILDINGS AND CLIMATE PLANS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FOR COMMUNITIES MORE BROADLY SO MANY WAYS OUR CITIES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN LABORATORIES AND I THINK VERY IMPORTANT LABORATORIES TO SEE TRY POLICIES AND SEE WHAT'S WORKING AND NOW SOME CITIES ARE CONSIDERING TAKING THE NEXT STEP AND STARTED THE LONG DIFFICULT PATH OF REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM EXISTING BUILDINGS AND WE KNOW IT'S URGENTLY NEEDED THE AB THREE THIRTY TWO THIRTY TWO REPORT SHOWED HOW DIFFICULT WILL BE TO HIT OUR EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS FROM BUILDINGS. EVEN AN INCREDIBLY AGGRESSIVE REPLACE ON BURNOUT ORDINANCE WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO REDUCE EMISSIONS 40% BY TWENTY THIRTY AS OUR GOALS- BUT RATHER THAN- THE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF AB EMBRACE THIS EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH WITH THIS BILL WOULD DO WOULD CREATE A LITIGATION NIGHTMARE AND EFFECTIVE PREVENT ANY NEW BUILDING DECARBONIZATION MEASURES OF THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE BILL GIVES VAST NEW APPROVAL AUTHORITIES TO THE CC OVER ANY KIND OF LOCAL ROLE EVEN THAT LOCALLY PASSED BALLOT MEASURES. AND PREVENTS THE CDC FROM APPROVING ANY LOCAL REQUIREMENT THAT CROSSES ANY OF A LIST VAGUELY DEFINED OUTLINES SO I DO. A YOU KNOW ONE STRONGLY RAISE MY CONCERNS I DO WANT TO. SAY I THINK THE AUTHOR RAISES SOME VALID ISSUES WITH THE BILL I THINK IN THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR TAKING ACTION ON CLIMATE SOME CITIES. MAIN ACT ORTON SAYS THAT OVER REACH. AND THEY MAY NOT REALIZE THAT EXEMPTIONS FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF BUILDINGS ARE CERTAIN USE CASES ARE JUSTIFIED AT LEAST TEMPORARILY. BECAUSE RECENTLY COST EFFECTIVE LECTURES OPTIONS ARE NOT YET COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. SO I CAN IMAGINE IN A WORKING THE FUTURE WITH THE AUTHOR ON A BILL THAT REQUIRES A CC TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE. TO CITIES CONSIDERING DECARBONISATION ORTON SAYS AND HELPS THEM UNDERSTAND WHERE LACK OF AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY WOULD MAKE SOLUTIONS. I'M IN FEASIBLE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE ON BUT THIS IS NOT THAT BILL AND AS IT COMMUNICATED TO THE AUTHOR I'M GOINGTO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME. IN PREVENTING WHAT'S REALLY AN ATTACK ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS. OKAY DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AS INDIVIDUAL WHO. WORK NOT ONLY FOR UTILITY OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL NONPROFIT THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH WE'VE SEEN THE- GREAT INTENTIONS. AND INTENT BY INDIVIDUALS BOTH LOCALLY. AND STATE AND FEDERAL TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT CLIMATE AND THEY'RE LEGIT. BUT MANY TIMES WE SET ARBITRARY LAUDABLE GOALS THAT ARE ASPIRATIONAL AT BEST IN HARD TO REACH. THE REASON WHY WE SAW SO MANY PEOPLE LOSE THEIR LIFE LIVE HERE IN TEXAS DURING THAT WINTER VORTEX. WAS TO THE FACT THOSE WERE ALL ELECTRIFIED HOMES. THOSE HOMES STILL BEEN PLUMBED FOR GAS WITH GAS BILLS INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THAT GAS CONTINUES TO PLAY WE WOULD NOT HAVE MET OUR CLIMATE COLD. GOALS AS A NATION. ARE PARIS ACCORD GOALS IF IT WASN'T FOR NATURAL GAS LAST YEAR SO I JUST WANTED TO BE- YOU HAS WHAT THEY SAY. POMPOM FELICIAN A PRETTY WISE OR WHATEVER THE. TERM IS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. THE STILL ROLLED. THE IMPACT ON- OUR OUR ENVIRONMENT WE ALL YOU KNOW ARE COMMITTED TO THAT CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IF NOT THE WORLD AND MUCH OF WHAT WE DO BUT TO CONTINUE TO ASSIST. YOU KNOW PUT THESE ASPIRATIONAL GOALS AND RESTRICT. COMMONSENSE APPROACHES TO WHAT A LOT OF POOR FOLKS NEED IN THEIR HOMES TO IN ORDER TO HEAT THEIR HOMES I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MATTER THANK YOU GO TO CENTER GONZALEZ AND SENATOR EGGMAN- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- HAVE A QUESTION FOR- THE SENATOR. IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHESS ABSOLUTELY YES HI THANK YOU- WHY I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE UP OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT- LOTS OF IDEAS AND THOUGHTS ON ON MANY SITES BUT- THE ARGUMENTS IN OPPOSITION JUST. OF COURSE STATE THE YOU KNOW. THE IMPACTS OF DOING SORT OF A STATE WIDE APPROACH VERSUS GOING THROUGH LOCAL ORDINANCES. I MEAN HOW DO YOU ENVISION THE- THE CAUTIOUS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THAT IS A THAT IS A REAL ISSUE HERE. AND I DON'T SEE WHERE ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CAN. YOU KNOW REALLY BE A TARGETED- WITH THIS WITH THE APPROACH- STATED IN YOUR BILL SO CAN YOU JUST ADDRESS THAT I KNOW IT'S A BIG QUESTION BUT I JUST WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR- OKAY. THANK YOU SENATOR I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS IN A MINUTE ASCA- ANTHONY SAMPSON TO JUMP IN AS WELL. THE ISSUE HERE IS ITS MUNICIPALITIES CITY GOVERNMENTS THEY CHANGE ALL THE TIME. EVERY NOVEMBER EVERY FOUR YEARS WHATEVER THAT IS AND WORK ON OUR ENVIRONMENT I TOO AM DOING THE SAME THING. I AM JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE FAMILY WHO CAN'T AFFORD FOR SOMEONE TO KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SAID YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE YOUR GAS STOVE AND YOUR WAY OF EATING- INTO ELECTRIC. SYSTEM AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. WILL YOU BE HEARD WHAT WAS SAID TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND FOR. THIS BILL ALL IT DOES IS IF ASSUMING FOUR SQUARE BLOCKS IN YOUR DISTRICT ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED WELL ALL IT MEANS IS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE STATE- A. N. TALK WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND THEY IN TURN WOULD OVERSEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND IF IT'S FOR. THEY'LL BACK IT IF IT'S NOT. THEN THEY WON'T THAT'S ALL IT IS JUST A OF THE BALANCING THE CHECKS AND BALANCES SO COMMUNITIES ARE ARBITRARILY TOLD TO DO SOMETHING. WITHOUT THE STATE ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING SO IT'S JUST THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION BEFORE ACTION IS TAKEN. THAT'S IT AND REMEMBER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OLDER STRUCTURES NOT NEW ONES IF THERE'S GONNA BE A BRAND YOU A TOWN HOUSE BUILT OR BRAND NEW HOMES BUILT GRANTED. THEN BECAUSE IT'S BRAND NEW THEN THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES WILL PROBABLY SAY WE'D LIKE TO HAVE THOSE- WITH ELECTRIC STOVES AND SOMEONE. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOM AND POP AND COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD LIKE WOULD NEED A CHOICE SO ANTHONY SAMPSON IF YOU'D LIKE TO JUMP IN. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT NOT THAT THAT YOU CAN ANSWER SUFFICIENT DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- CENTER GONZALEZ NO I DON'T AT THIS POINT IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT THIS IS WELL JUST GIVEN THAT THE CURRENT- LANGUAGE BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO. WORK WITH THAT THAT THE SENATOR TO SEE IF THERE'S- AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO AND THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK THE COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE WITH ME SO WE CAN LOOK AT AMENDMENTS TO THE FUTURE AND MOVE THE BILL ALONG. AND I'LL CERTAINLY WORK WITH THANK YOU SHARE AND EVERYONE ELSE. LET ME- GO TO CENTER EGGMAN NOW. THANK YOU MUCH MISS CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I. ALSO A SOMEBODY AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE WHO POINTED OUT THAT. HE UED TO WORK FOR UTILITY. AGENCY TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL BUT LIKE MANY OF US I SERVED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK EVEN MORE SO THAN THE STATE CITY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DON'T MOVE FASTER THAN THE PEOPLE THAT THEY REPRESENT BECAUSE WITH. THE CLOSEST TO IT. AND I CERTAINLY STARTED MY INTEREST IN WORKING IN- ENERGY AND ANNA AND WASTE TALK ABOUT THAT EARLIER TODAY DURING MY TIME. AS A LOCAL A LOCAL PERSON AND REALLY LISTENING TO WHAT PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED IN ANNA AND INTERESTING THINGS THAT YOU CAN OFTENTIMES SEE. MORE AT A LOCAL LEVEL BEFORE YOU MOVED TO A STATEWIDE LEVEL- SO I WILL ALSO HAVE A LOT. OF HER TIME SUPPORTING THE SAME PEOPLE HEARD ABOUT MY FONDNESS FOR MY- HUNDRED YEAR OLD HOUSE IN MY GAS STOVE AND THE ACT THAT I OWNED THAT- AND I ALSO. IN A CITY THAT GET OUT AHEAD BECAUSE AGAIN- THERE ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO A WHO ELECTS THEM- SO I DON'T I WOULDN'T WANNA STICK TO SLOW DOWN THE PROGRESS THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT WE ALL KNOW TO MAKE TO GET TO THIS POINT THAT WE ALL WANT TO GET TO. ON SO I WILL ALSO NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NIGHT ARE YOU KNOW I HEARD I HEARD SOME COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THIS BILL NEEDS WORK AND HOW. MEMBERS ARE WILLING TO ADDRESS KIND OF THE GOALS OF THE BILL. WE CAN'T AND IT'S EARLY IN THE PROCESS MEMBERS- JUST A STRAIGHT OUT NO VOTE ON ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES BILLS AT ADDRESSING A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK IS- IS A SMALL THING TO ASK JUST TO ALLOW HIM TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BILL. FROM MY FROM MY STANDPOINT OUTLOOK OUR STATE IS NOT ONLY WORKING ON. A RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY WERE ALSO TRYING TO TRANSFORM OUR- OUR GAS GRID. TO INJECT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS THAT IS EASIER ON THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT HELPS US ADDRESS OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND OTHER ECONOMIC GOALS. AND SO- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CERTAIN AREAS THAT HAVE DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO- CERTAIN LEVELS OF BALANCING OF THE GRID- IMAGINE COMPLETELY- IN SOME CASES- POSING SOME- REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE- VERY BURDENSOME FEDERAL COULD REALLY HELP BUILD OPPOSITION TO A LOT OF OUR STATE'S GOALS IN IN TRANSITIONING TO CLEANER POWER AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO- EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE THAT HAS A LEGISLATURE WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE ARE REALLY SUFFERING RIGHT NOW AND HAVING TO PAY THOSE BILLS. RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY I KNOW SAN DIEGO RECENTLY- THAT GOT A LOT OF FLAK FOR HAVING THE HIGHEST RATES NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE COUNTRY AND IT'S HARD FOR US TO SELL- RENEWABLE AGENDA WHEN WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES AND THEN WE HAVE TO IMPOSE OTHER REQUIREMENTS. ON COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY- THE WORKING POOR WHO ARE HAVING A HARD TIME STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT THIS BILL DESERVES. AT LEAST SOME SOME CONSIDERATIONS SOME ADDITIONAL WORK IF I. YOU CAN IMAGINE A OF FACES A HEAVY LIFT TRYING TO. ACCOMPLISH VERY HOT DIFFICULT THING I WISH THE AUTHOR LOTS OF LUCK IN DOING THAT AND I HOPE WE CAN. ALLOW HIM TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE SO WILLING TO DO SO AS HE HAS EXPRESSED SO AS FOR AN AYE VOTE FOR THIS BILL- AND IF WE CAN NOW- DID YOU HAVE ANY- SIR DOLLY. MOVE THE BILL- DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS AND- THANK YOU MISTER NAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR AYE VOTE I THANK YOU FOR THE ABILITY TO ALLOW ME. TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE COMMITTEE TO. GO FORWARD WITH AMENDMENTS TONIGHT- ASK FOR A VOTE TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU OKAY- BUT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB THIRTEEN NINETY THREE BY SENATOR ARCHULETA. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. WESSEL II. WESSEL HI DOLLY. DOLLY HI BAKER. BAKER NO FOR JUST. PORGES I BRADFORD BRADFORD HI DOT. EGGMAN. GONZALEZ GROWTH. HELLO I HERTZBERG. HERTZBERG AYE MCGUIRE STERN NO- SEVEN AS INTERNALS OKAY US SEVEN AS TO KNOWS- DID WE HAVE ABSENT MEMBERS ON THAT YES OKAY SO WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS OKAY I WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWO S. NINETY EIGHT CHAIR HE WON. BY A SENATOR MEN BUT THERE RELATING TO LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. IN THIS BILL WE HAVE- ONE LEAD SUPPORT ORGANIZED PRESENTATION ONE SPEAKER IN SUPPORT INTO IN OPPOSITION SO WE'LL DO. THREE MINUTES FOR THE SPEAKER IN SUPPORT WILL SPLIT THOSE THREE MINUTES BY THE TWO SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU CHAIRED BY SO THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE STAFF OF BEEN WORKING CLOSELY AS THIS ON THIS BILL I'M PRESENTING SP EIGHTY ONE WHICH CLARIFIES THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS THORLEY TO ENFORCE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES ARE L. AS HE'S- AND THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROCESS KNOWN AS INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING OR I. R. PEAS ARE CURRENTLY AT LAW REQUIRES L. S. EAST TO DEVELOP PLANS TO MEET THE RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS AND EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS TARGETS WHILE ALSO MINIMIZING COSTS. AND ENSURING GREATER LIABILITY THIS PLAN KNOWN AS THE I. R. P. IS A KEY FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE STATE'S ABILITY TO REACH ITS CLIMATE GOALS SB THREE FIFTY AUTHORED BY THEN PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE A DATE KEVIN DE LEÓN- CREATED INITIAL MANDATE PRIORITIES THIS BILL REQUIRES INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND OTHER ELECTRIC PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP I OUR FEES AND SUBMIT THEM TO THE P. YOU SEE. FOR APPROVAL EVERY TWO YEARS. RECENTLY THE P. YOU SEE COMPLETED THE SECOND TWO YEAR CYCLE OF THE I. R. P. AND IS CURRENTLY PLANNING FOR AN ADDITIONAL CYCLE WHICH WILL FOCUS ENTIRELY- OUR FOCUS CLOSELY ON EXISTING NATURAL GAS POWER PRICES. AND PLANNING FOR A FORTY FIVE. THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY WOULD REQUIRE THE P. YOU SEE IS PART OF THE I. R. P. REQUIRE EACH LOAD SERVING ENTITY. UNDERTAKES EFFICIENT PROCUREMENT TO REACH ELECTRICITY SECTOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. HOW DOES THIS WORK IF YOU SEE CURRENTLY ALREADY HAS REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER LSTS AND IS IN REQUIRED BY LAW TO OVERSEE THE PROCESS. OF LSE SUBMITTING THEIR PLANS. THE PC IS ALSO REQUIRED TO SCHEDULE PERIODIC UPDATES TO THOSE PLANS REVIEW THEM AND ULTIMATELY ENSURE THAT LSE'S MEET THEIR OBJECTIVES. IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE THE IF YOU SEE WITH ALL THE TOOLS IT NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT THESE LSTS MEET THEIR GOALS. SB EIGHTY ONE REQUIRED IF YOU SEE THE INSURER SUFFICIENT PROCUREMENT EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE. AND CREATE A PLAN BY AUTHORIZING P. U. C. ASSESSED PENALTIES IF AN LSE FAILS TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE PUCO AUTHORIZE ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT WHEN NEEDED. HI THIS IS NOT ONLY A NATURAL NEXT STEP FOR THE EVOLUTION I THE I. R. P. IT'S A NECESSARY NEXT STEP. THE I. R. P. WAS DESIGNED PRIMARILY AS A PLANNING PROCESS BUT IT KEEPS IDENTIFYING SHORTFALLS. IN NOVEMBER TWENTIETH NINETEEN THE PC HAD TO ORDER PROCUREMENT OVER THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS FOR NEAR TERM LIKE RELIABILITY. LAST SUMMER THE QC ORDERED PROCUREMENT OF OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS FOR NEAR AND MEDIUM RELIABILITY. ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS IF YOU SEE HAS LOOKED AT THE SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND IDENTIFIED SUBSTANTIAL SHORTFALLS. SHOWING THE NEED FOR THE P. YOU SEE TO BE ABLE TO ACT WHEN THEY IDENTIFY THE SHORTFALLS. AS SUCH THIS BILL PRINT WOULD PROMOTE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PUC'S ORDERS. AND ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR THEM- TO ENFORCE AGAINST IF THEY FAIL TO COMPLY. SB EIGHT EIGHTY ONE IS SPONSORED BY THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS AND SUPPORTED BY LABOR LABOR COALITIONS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION ELECTRIC WORKERS. THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY PAYING- EMPLOYEES. AS AS IN BY ORDER. SUCH AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND ENVIRO VOTERS AND IT IS HERE CLUB. JOINING US TODAY TO TESTIFY I HAVE MORE EXPECT AND WESTERN STATES ENERGY MANAGER AND SENIOR ANALYST AT THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS. OKAY WE WILL- DAUGHTER MARC. SPECTOR- YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES SIR. GREAT THANK YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY YES. EXCELLENT THANKS AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON MARCH FACT WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY EIGHTY ONE. OVERALL THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE TOOLS AND PROCESSES IN PLACE. TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY SECTOR ACHIEVED FIFTY CARBONIZATION AND CLEAN ENERGY GOAL. NOW BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THREE FIFTY WHICH ESTABLISHED THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING OR IRP PROCESS. AND IT REQUIRED BOTH LIVING ENTITY DETERMINE HOW TO MEET FUTURE ELECTRICITY DEMAND WHILE ENSURING GREATER RELIABILITY MAINTAINING AFFORDABILITY ACHIEVING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND CLEAN ENERGY GOAL. THE R. P. HAS SINCE DEVELOPED INTO A ROBUST PLANNING PROCESS BUT THERE ARE STILL NO REQUIREMENT IN PLACE- THAT MODE SERVING ENTITIES MEET THE FABULOUS GOAL REDUCING GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION. AND PROCURING THE NECESSARY CLEAN ENERGY TO ACHIEVE THE COMMISSION PRODUCTION. THERE ARE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE AS PART OF THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD THAT DO ENSURE BOTH SERVING ENTITIES REACH 60% RENEWABLE ENERGY BY TWENTY THIRTY. BUT IT'S CLEAR FROM THE R. P. THAT MOTORING ANY WILL NEED TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND TO MEET THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR'S GLOBAL WARMING EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGET. SO THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE GREATER CLARITY THAT THE G. P. S. B. SHALL REQUIRE MOTORING ENTITIES TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL AND I LEFT HE FAILED TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS THE BILL. CLARIFY YOU'D BE READY TO ASSESS PENALTIES IN ORDER. BACKSTOPS PROCUREMENT IF NECESSARY. IN SUMMARY HE TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA GDP CARBONIZATION AND CLEAN ENERGY GOALS WE NEED THIS NARROW YET NECESSARY STATUTORY CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU WILL GO TO SPEAKERS HERE IN THE GALLERY IN SUPPORT OF ITEM TWO S. B. EIGHTY EIGHT ONE. WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I'M JOHN WHITE WITH THE CLEAN POWER CAMPAIGN AND- WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WE THINK IT WILL STRENGTHEN OVERSIGHT AND PERFORMANCE BY THE UTILITIES AND THE OTHER LITTLE SERVING ENTITIES RESPIRABLE OKAY THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN THE GALLERY. OKAY WE'LL GO TO THE MODERATOR ASKED FOR SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OF ITEM TWO S. B. EIGHT EIGHT ONE. AND TWO PLEASE LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURES MODERATOR PLEASE CALL SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT EIGHT ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE. ZERO AT THE TIME. I HAVE ABOUT THREE LINES IN Q. ABOUT TO LINE THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE HAVE. SANTIAGO WAS CALIFORNIAN FINANCIAL LITERACY CALLING IN SUPPORT AND WE DON'T FEEL LIKE DIMINISH THEIR SUPPORT FOR SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. VERY WELL NINETY ONE TWENTY NINE. TWENTY NINE PEOPLE HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBER IS THE KEY TO KARATE WITH NRDC ALSO CALLING IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MAKE YOU MINE TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE HAVE. CAN YOU BE CARRIED ON BEHALF OF TURN THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK WITH THE SUPPORT OF AMENDED PETITION. THANK YOU I'M THIRTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO YOU CAN HEAR ME YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES THIS IS BRUCE NAGLE SUSTAINABLE SO COMPELLING SUPPORT. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER COMMENT THANK YOU. OKAY VERY WELL NOW WILL GO TO THE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION THE ORGANIZED PRESENTATION HAS TWO SPEAKERS AT A REGISTER TO ANDREW. KAKASHI DAR WITH US HELLO CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND- THEN JEFF CIPHERS WITH CINEMA KEEPING POWER- EACH WILL GET A MINUTE AND A HALF OF. MISTER NKOSI DAR. UP ARE YOU THERE. JEREMY HERE IN THE GALLERY. WELL YOU'RE IN THE GALLERY OKAY- GOOD AFTERNOON SHERRY MEMBERS MY NAME IS INJURED BECAUSE IT ARE FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON FIRST WE WANT TO THANK ALL THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US GENEROUSLY GIVING US- THEIR LIMITED TIME STUFF WORK ON THIS BILL HAS BEEN EXEMPLARY AND THINK THAT RESPECTFUL THANK YOU WE ALSO GREATLY APPRECIATED CENTER TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU SENATOR. SB EIGHTY ONE INCREASES THE PENALTIES FOR THOSE SERVING ENTITIES THAT DO NOT MEET RENEWABLE PROCUREMENT STANDARDS TO BE CLEAR S. C. FULLY SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA'S GOALS AND LAWS OF CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE IN FACT IS PART OF OUR CORPORATE GOALS UNFORTUNATELY SB EIGHT EIGHT ONE DOES NOT COMPORT WITH CURRENT LAW AND PRECEDENT AS ESTABLISHED BY SB THREE FIFTY CURRENT STATUTE PROVIDES THAT IF A RETAIL SELLER DEMONSTRATES THAT IS TAKEN ALL REASONABLE ACTIONS UNDER ITS CONTROL. THEN THE CPUC CAN CHOOSE TO WAIVE PENALTIES UNFORTUNATELY SB EIGHTY ONE REMOVES THE DISCRETION OF THE CPC AND US UNFAIRLY PUNISHES LOW SERVING ENTITIES FOR UNFORESEEN EVENTS AND ACTIONS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. ANY NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ISSUES OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL CAN CAUSE DELAY LOCAL PERMITTING DELAYS SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES A PANDEMIC THEREFORE S. C. RESPECTFULLY REQUESTS AND AMENDMENTS SB EIGHT EIGHT ONE THAT WOULD GRANT THE CPUC DISCRETION. IN CLOSING S. C. OPPOSE S. B. SUBMITTED I RESPECTFULLY URGES YOU KNOW VOTE pTHANK YOU PERFECT TIMING THANK YOU AND NOW WILL GO TO- JEFF SINCE I FIRST. HE PERSON OR ON THE- VERY GOOD. PLEASE BEGIN I'M ONLINE YET. I'M JUST DRIVERS WITH THE NUMBER TWENTY FOUR HOUR IF YOU SEE A CERTAIN PHENOMENA MENDOCINO COUNTY AND ALSO SPEAKING ON THE APPLE CAL PTSD REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY THREE CPA AND REGRETTABLY WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL EIGHTY ONE COMMAND SO WE DO AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE STEADY PROGRESS ON CUTTING EMISSIONS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THE MECHANISM SHOULD BE CLEAR AND AVOID CREATING UNNECESSARY REPAIR COSTS. AND IS CURRENTLY DRAFT THE BILL. CREEK GAS REDUCTIONS TO INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS TO MAP IN ACTION IT WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF POWER PROVIDERS THE COST EFFECTIVELY MEET THE STATE'S CHRONICLES. INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS ON GASES ABOUT FUTURE CONDITONS AND ARE OUT OF DATE IT'S GOING TO BE A PUBLISHED. AND FORCING POWER PROVIDERS TO STRICTLY FOLLOW THEM WOULD PREVENT US FROM MAKING USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND FROM PREVENTING. PROTECTING RATEPAYERS FROM UNPLEASANT MARKET SURPRISE. L. 8% OF THE AND- WITH TO SUGGEST. FIRST PUBLISHED CLEARLY DEFINED INTERIM RENEWABLE CARBON FREE ENERGY TARGETS IN THE RPF. FROM YEAR TWENTY THIRTY THREE TWENTY FORTY FIVE. SO THE CLIMATE PROGRESS CAN BE ENFORCED. AND SECOND TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE YOU SEE TO APPLY MEANINGFUL FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR ALL KINDS OF OUR PROVIDERS THE FAILED TO COMPLY. CONFIDENT WITH SOME CHANGES WE CAN PUBLIC MEDIA WAY THAT WORKS UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL DOESN'T WORK TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I WILL GO TO- SPEAKERS. IN OPPOSITION BEGINNING WITH THE GALLERY OF THIRTY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU ARE MELISSA CORTEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION I'M THE WRONG LINE ON MY APOLOGIES WE ARE ACTUALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHASE AND I COULD ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED FOR THE REASONS STATED BY MR CIPHERS. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER. THANK YOU I'M THIRTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS HILLARY SEVEN ON BEHALF OF CENTRAL COAST COMMUNITY ENERGY OKAY SHORT I. CRICKETER SERVING THIRTY THREE COMMUNITIES IN SANTA CRUZ MODERATE BENITO AND A BARBARA AND FAMILIES OBISPO COUNTY. AND WE ARE ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED- TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF. THE COUNTY SAN MR SPICER. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU OKAY WILL COME TO THE COMMITTEE DO WE HAVE ANYONE OF COMMITTEE LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS. SENATE RUBIO SEVEN HAND OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- PRESS WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE RAYNOLDS ADDED TEN PART IN THAT- IT'S CLARIFIED WHO HAS C. ACCOUNTABILITY FACTOR HERE BUT I KNOW THAT I PERSONALLY GOT A LOT OF OPPOSITION AT THE LAST MINUTE AND I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT DT THE AUTHOR IS STILL WORKING OUT SOME OF THE DETAILS AND SO I JUST WANNA. EXPRESS SOME OF MY CONCERNS BUT I WANT TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THIS BILL AND CIRCLE BACK WITH MY OFFICE CELL RIGHT NOW I WILL- SUPPORTED BUT AGAIN I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT I KNOW THAT THERE IS TALKS ABOUT POSSIBLE LANGUAGE OUR THAT WOULD MAKE IT BETTER IN AVOID UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN THE FUTURE AND IT YOU KNOW I COULD FALL INTO BUT AT THIS POINT I WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE SUPPORTIVE BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. BAKER THANK YOU OKAY. SO I'M A CO OFFICE BUILDING IN A SUPPORTED TODAY BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT- WE BECAUSE THE R. P. WHICH IS THE MAIN WAY THAT THE PC'S GONNA BE MANAGING ELECTRICITY SECTOR TOWARDS A 100% CLEAN ENERGY OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE R. P. PROCESS IS MORE THAN JUST A PLANNING PROCESS THAT EVERYONE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THESE PLANS. AND HIT THE RELIABILITY CLEAN ENERGY TARGETS HAD BEEN SET FOR THEM. HOWEVER I AM CONCERNED THAT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT STAKEHOLDERS HAVE RAISED. MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK AT THAT EACH ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER. OF THE RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISION ABOUT WHAT RESOURCES TO PURCHASE. INCLUDING TV IN FOR THE CIVIC CENTER OF RESOURCES THAT. THE THAT THAT THE FORECAST WOULD BE THE PROCURE IN THERE ARE P. SUBMISSION. AS ON SUPPORT FOR OF RESOURCES THAT DID DID YOU PROCURE IS EFFICIENT SATISFIED THERE ARE PS REQUIREMENT. THERE SHE GIGI TARGET AND OUR APPLICATION SO. BASICALLY. YOU KNOW ANY PC THIRTY. I'M GIVEN TO THE PC BY THIS R. P. STATURE TO IMPOSE FINES SHOULD BE LIMITED TO CASES IN WHICH THE ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS ARE NOT ON TRACK HIT THIS PERFORMANCE BASED TARGETS OF HUMAN REYES AT ISSUE THAT YOU THINK PORTEN AND HELPED AUTHOR CONTINUE WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE IF WE CAN KEEP MOVING FORWARD ON THOSE ISSUES BERMAN SAID TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. THAT'S VERY INTERESTING I THOUGHT YOU WERE YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT THIS BILL OPENS UP A LOT A LAWSUIT. TO THE PLANNING PROCESS. BUT IT'S INTERESTING THE LAST BILLS A PLANNING BILL. AND BUT IT REQUIRES CITIES TO PLAN AND- THIS WILL REQUIRE UTILITIES AND TO THE INTEREST IN THE WAY- THE SUPPORT SHIPS ON THIS ONE YOU KNOW I AM IN FAVOR OF. A PLANNING AND- SHARING WITH THE PUBLIC- PLANS ON THAT ISSUE THAT'S WHY. I THINK WE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT BUT- CENTER DOT. YES MY OF MY COLLEGE REFLECTS THAT THOSE OF US SENATOR. SEE SOME CHANGES- BY THE TIME HE GETS THE FLOOR. SENATOR STERN. OKAY- AGAIN- WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR HERE ON THIS BILL- PLANNING CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED AND I'LL WE- WE HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF TIME TO REALLY PROPOSED ANYTHING THAT'S WHY WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS BUT- AGAIN- WORKING TOWARD- SOME OF THE SAME GOALS THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE OTHERS. RELATED TO LIKE TRICITY. VERSUS GAS AND- I REALLY THINK THAT WE- HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO PLAN- THE ENERGY GRID TO THE FUTURE THAT'S ALL THE ENERGY GRID SO- WISH THE- AUTHOR LOOK AT WORKING WITH THIS AND WE'LL BE KEEPING OUR EYE ON THIS BILL ANY CLOSING COMMENTS SENTIMENT I THANK YOU CHAIR WAY SO AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOU ALL- AS YOU ALLUDED TO THESE ELEMENTS CAME IN AFTER- THE AUTHORS AMENDMENT DEADLINE HAD EXPIRED SO- AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH OPPOSITION- WITH RESPECT TO SOUTHERN CONSOLIDATED EDISON. WE ARE WORKING WITH I WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT UNDER THE LANGUAGES FOR PC HAS DISCRETION BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM CONTINUING THEM TO FIND WAYS TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS WERE ALSO WORKING WITH THE CCA'S AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE THEIR INPUT WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UTILIZE THE I. R. P. PROCESS AND NOT THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS. WHICH ARE A BIT OF APPLES AND ORANGES BUT- WE WILL WORK WITH YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF WE WILL- TAKE THEIR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE SUGGESTIONS GOING FORWARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR OUT ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE THIS BILL RIGHT SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. VERY WELL OF J. THAT VERY MUCH THANK YOU THE CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB EIGHT ONE BY SENATOR MAN THE MOTION IS IT PASSED TO APPROPRIATE DO PASS AS AMENDED OKAY TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS FOR GIVING. RUSSELL HI WESSEL HI. SALLY BAKER YEAH HI- BAKER HI A HOLD ON A SECOND- ARE YOU THE MOST- THE MOTION WAS MADE BY. BY SENATOR BAKER WASN'T. NO. WHAT DID YOU MOVE THE BILL OKAY WE CAN WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS BILL. OKAY WE HAVE MUCH MORE CENTER STERN WE- START WITH THE- AND AGAIN THE MOTION. IS THE PAST APPROPRIATIONS- CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB EIGHT ONE TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WESSEL BY WESSEL HI DOLLY. BAKER I BAKER I EDVARD. DODD I DODD AYE EGGMAN BY EIGHT MEN I GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ HI HELLO. HERTZBERG HERTZBERG BY MCGUIRE. MAN MAN I RUBIO. RUBIO I TURN BY TURN I. SHARE THE BILL HAS AS- OKAY THANK YOU WELL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS I WILL MOVE ON TO S. P. EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN BY SENATOR BAKER- THIS IS- ITEM THREE SB EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN. RELATING TO ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION FACILITY PLANNING ANOTHER PLANNING BILL. THERE BAKER. HELLO RIGHT REAR. AFTER MR N. THAT MEMBERS YES THIS IS A PLANNING BILL NOT PROHIBITING CITIES TO DO ANYTHING THIS IS A PLANNING BILL WE CAN'T GET YOUR ADDRESS AND CLEAN ENERGY OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS WITHOUT BUILDING TO TRANSMIT THE NECESSARY TO DELIVER THAT CLEAN POWER TO OUR CITIES. SB EIGHTY PLANNING AND APPROVALS FOR TRANSMISSION PROJECTS. THE SB ONE HUNDRED REPORT ESTIMATED THAT WE NEED TO TRIPLE THE STATE'S ELECTRIC GENERATION CAPACITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. IN OUR TRANSMISSION GRID IS JUST NOT PREPARED TO DELIVER THIS VAST AMOUNT INCREASING CLEAN ENERGY. I'M THIS PROBLEMS ONLY GONNA GET WORSE AS ELECTRIFICATION TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDINGS INCREASE DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY. UNLESS WE BEGIN TO BUILD THE TRANSMISSION CAPACITY THAT WE NEED TO HANDLE THE CLEAN ENERGY GRID OF THE FUTURE. IT IS URGENT THAT WE GET STARTED THE BILL NOW BECAUSE MAJOR NEW TRANSMISSION PROJECTS OFTEN TAKE TEN YEARS OR MORE TO BUILD. AND OUR OUR ACCOUNT THAT THE CASE- CONTROLS TRANSMISSION PLANNING APPROVALS AND IT'S BEEN HIGHLY IN THE NEED TO PLAN FOR TRANSMISSION GROWTH TO MATCH A RENEWABLE ENERGY BUILD OUT. HOWEVER THE ONLY A- PROVED ITS MISSION IF IT IS JUSTIFIED BY THE FORECAST BEGETS FROM THE CCM QC. AND THOSE FORECASTS HAVE BEEN INADEQUATE. BUT THIS BILL AIMS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM THE RECENT EFFORTS BY CASE TO DEVELOP A TWENTY YEAR TRANSMISSION OUTLOOK WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SB EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN WILL ENSURE THESE PRACTICES CONTINUE AND IMPROVE IT REQUIRES THE P. C. N. C. C. RIGHT FORECAST TO CRY SO THE EXTENT AT LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS IN THE FUTURE. THOSE FORECAST MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH ACHIEVING SB ONE HUNDRED TARGETS FOR RENEWABLE AND ZERO CARBON RESOURCES. AND CONSISTENT WITH THEIR BE SCOPING PLAN TARGETS FOR ECONOMY WIDE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. THE FORECAST MUST INCLUDE PLANS TO REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON GAS PLANTS THE EXTENT THAT IS CAUSED BY TRANSMISSION BOTTLENECKS TO DELETE THEM AS A LINE WITH THE STATE'S STRATEGY FOR DEVELOPING OFFSHORE WIND. AND TO MAKE SURE WE GET START RIGHT AWAY IT DIRECTS THE PC TO ASK AYE SO TO CONSIDER APPROVING AT LEAST ONE HIGH PRIORITY NO REGRETS TRANSMISSION PROJECT. DURING THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS. I WANT TO QUICKLY ADDRESS CONCERNS SOME PEOPLE RAISED ABOUT THE BILL. THERE'S BEEN SUGGESTIONS THE BILL REQUIRES ALL GAS POWER PLANTS TO SHUT DOWN BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND THAT IS VERY MUCH NOT ACCURATE. THE BILL JUST REQUIRES A PC'S RESOURCE FORECASTS NOT TO RELY ON GAS PLANTS BECAUSE- OF TRANSMISSION CONSTRAINTS. I'M HAPPY CAN TO DISCUSS ANY CONCERNS RAISED BY THE STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN RELIABILITY. AND DON'T CREATE AN EXCESSIVELY EXPENSIVE MANDATE. THE BILL JUST SAYING THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE'S ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY ELSEWHERE ON THE GRID. WE SHOULD NOT NEED TO RUN THE GAS PLANTS JUST BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SIX TRANSMISSION BOTTLENECKS LET'S FIX THOSE TRANSMISSION BOTTLENECKS. WE'RE ON A PATH FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF NEW CLEAN ENERGY ELECTRICITY GENERATION BUT WITHOUT COMPATIBLE EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR TRANSMISSION CAPACITY THE SEVERAL FAIR TO FAIR WILL FAIL TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HELPING TO IMPROVE THE BILL. BEYOND THE ITEMS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE ANALYSIS WERE ALSO ADDRESSING ADDING A DATE BY WHEN THE BETTER FORECAST WILL BE REQUIRED. AND WE WILL BE STRIKING A REFERENCE TO CARBS INVOLVEMENT IN THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS. PROCESS AT CARBS REQUEST SINCE CARP IS NOT CURRENTLY INVOLVED. I WANT TO THANK A BIPARTISAN AND BICAMERAL GROUP THIS RT AT HONEST CO AUTHORS AND- THE GROUPS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA STATE SOCIOCULTURAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL LABOUR'S. COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY UNIONS INTERNATIONAL OF OPERATING ENGINEERS. MEMO SPARK ANDMANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. OKAY VERY WELL WHAT WILL GO TO- SPEAKERS. WE HAVE AN ORGANIZED PRESENTATIONS SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT THERE ARE. TWO SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT WILL SO WILL CUT THEIR TIME. AFTER EACH SHOW TO BE A MINUTE AND A HALF FROM MICHAEL COLEMAN. AT A MINUTE AND A HALF FOR STEVE MIGHT. I WILL START WITH MICHAEL COLEMAN IF YOU SEE THERE HERE ON THE LINE. YEAH HELLO I'M ON THE LINE CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES. CONTACT ON MY NAME IS MICHAEL HOLDEN I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY PROGRAM. ONE NINE THAT COULD BE RECORDING SENATE BILL EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN- AS WE UNDERGO OUR CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION REGION ALL RECOGNIZED. GENERATING POWER AND NOT GETTING THE POWER TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED WHY IS IT. GOING TO MEAN NEW TRANSMISSION. ON ALL YOU- YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO I WOULD HAVE THE FADING INTO THE LIKE THAT- I INCORRECTLY ASSUMED THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO REACH CLEAN ENERGY GOALS THE TIME EXPANSION OF THE EXISTING TRANSMISSION. HOWEVER I TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS ARE CLOSELY NINE OUT OF THE COUNTRY ALL. I CAN CONFIDENTLY CONCLUDE THAT EVEN IF THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET NOTHING LOCAL. WE'RE STILL GOING TO NEED A TRANSMISSION LINE. IN ORDER TO BUILD IS OUT OF PORTABLE LEAD TO DO TO HIS FAMILY WE'RE GOING TO NEED A PLAN NOTHING IS GOING TO HAVE TO START NOW. THE CASE WHO SHOULD BE APPLAUDED FOR ALL OF THEIR INNOVATIVE WORK IN THERE NOW TWENTY YEAR OUTLOOK PLAN. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT NOVEL DOCUMENT. UNKNOWN IS THE INTERAGENCY COORDINATION AT THE PARK AT ALL I AM OUT. BY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD EXPRESS TO USE AS WELL SB EIGHTY SEVEN IS THE BEST VEHICLE FOR THE CHAMBER AND PROVIDE THE IMPORTANT. CONTRIBUTION PLANNING. WITH THAT I SUPPORT THE BILL AND I HUMBLY FOR YOUR ITEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE'LL GO TO STEVE. MY TAKE. THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER I'M ON THE PHONE AND- I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY- MY NAME IS STEVEN TANK- I'M AN ELECTRIC UTILITY CONSULTANT WITH MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE- DIRECTING ENERGY LOAD FORECASTING INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING TRANSMISSION PLANNING. ALL AT A SPECIFIC GAS ELECTRIC COMPANY. FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT WITH A FOCUS ON HOW TO PLAN AND OPERATE THE ELECTRIC. RESPONSIBLY AND ECONOMICALLY AND I HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THEN. CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. SENATE BACKER AND- HOLDEN MENTION- WE NORMALLY DEVELOPMENT IN THE YEARS TO COME I IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS HOWEVER CALIFORNIA'S NOT BEEN KEEPING PACE IN APPROVING THAT NEEDED NEW TRANSMISSION. ESPECIALLY THOSE LONG LEAD TIME TRANSMISSION PROJECTS TO DELIVER POWER FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES. TO THE LOAD CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. SB EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN THE PROBLEM IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS FIRST PLAY ENDING THE STATE AGENCY ELECTRIC LOAD FORECASTING RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PLANS TO FIFTEEN YEARS OR MORE INTO THE FUTURE. THE CURRENT TEN YEAR HORIZONS ARE GOOD FOR FOCUSING ON GENERATION RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED EXTRA LEADERS SEVEN YEARS BUT THOSE POOR CAN NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT- RESOURCES THAT WILL BE NEEDED. FOR ELECTRIFICATION THERE'S INTO THE FUTURE. THERE'S YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND APPRECIATE YOU WEIGH IN AND- WE'RE GOING TO GO TO IN OPPOSITION AND PLEASE LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO YOUR NAME AFFILIATION POSITION ON THE BILL ANYONE HERE IN THE GALLERY IN OPPOSITION TO I MEAN IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU OKAY WILL GO TO AN ORGANIZED PRESENTATION IN OPPOSITION LED BY CHANCE MONEY JONES ONE SPEAKER THREE MINUTES IF HE'S HERE OR ON THE PHONE. THE PHONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH VISION GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS ON JAZZ NINETY JONES WITH THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS WE ARE OPPOSED SB EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN- OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE UTILITY SCALE SOLAR WIND GEOTHERMAL BIOMASS CLEAN NATURAL GAS ENERGY STORAGE AND INDEPENDENT TRANSMISSION PROJECTS WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN BEATING CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS BY BUILDING OUT THE RESOURCES- TO MEET FUTURE DATE NOW I. P. SHARES THE AUTHOR'S INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE NECESSARY TRANSMISSION AVAILABLE TO DELIVER CLEAN RESOURCES. HOWEVER IT IS IMPORTANT THESE PROJECTS ARE COST EFFECTIVE AND ONCE DEVELOPED IN A TIMELY MANNER WE BELIEVE THAT S. B. EIGHT H. SEVEN MILLION HE DID NOT ACCELERATE. SHOULD. SEE BILL WOULD GO INTO A ONE ONE AT TWENTY TWO THREE- TWO WEEKS LATER THE BILL REQUIRES THE P. USE TO REQUEST THE- OF APPROVE. TO TRANSFER PRICE DESIGNED TO REPLACE GAS GENERATION AND LOCAL CONSTRAINED AREAS OTHER NOTE OTHERWISE KNOWN AS LCAS. THERE IS NO COST EFFECTIVENESS CRITERIA ASSOCIATED WITH THIS REQUIREMENT. IS NOT CLEAR HOW THE QC OR THE I SO COULD IMPLEMENT THE REQUIRED PUBLIC COMMENT THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS IN A TWO WEEK. TIME CALVET SO ALREADY HAS A FINANCIAL UP L. C. A. PROCESS TO EVALUATE- THE NEED FOR SUCH PLANTS. KALISTO CURRENTLY HAS A TEN YEAR PLANNING SO. CHANGING IT TO FIFTY. REQUIRE EIGHTY BURKE AND THEN IT WHICH MADE IT HAD TO DO TIME. THIS BILL DOES REQUIRE THE AND ELIMINATION OF GAS FACILITIES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE PLEASE SEE HE FOR HOWEVER ALL CPUC I. R. P. STUDY SHOWS GAS FACILITIES WILL BE NECESSARY. FOR RELIABILITY THROUGH TWENTY FORTY FIVE THEY WILL RUN LESS BUT WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET GROUP RELIABILITY NEEDS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. SOME OF THESE PLANS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND HYDROGEN AS FUEL SOURCES OTHERS ARE UTILIZING CARBON. CARBON CAPTURE AND UTILIZATION SEVERAL THESE AS FOR READY USE ONSITE BATTERY STORAGE IS A COMPONENT RELIABILITY OPERATION. SB EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN HAS AN ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS A HIGHER PRIORITY TO ELIMINATING THESE PLANTS AND LCAS RATHER THAN FOCUS ON TRANSMISSION FACILITIES TO ACCESS. NEW CLEAN RESOURCES ELSEWHERE CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED IN LEGISLATING PLAN- TRANSMISSION PLANNING OUTCOMES TRANSMISSIONS SERVING CALIFORNIA IS INTERCONNECTED TO THE ENTIRE WEST. DECISIONS BASED UPON A TRANSPARENT PROCESS SOLID ENGINEERING AND COST EFFECTIVENESS PRINCIPLES THAT ARE ALL CONSISTENT. WITH THE LAWS OF. D. AS A DENTAL FIVE THERE IS ROOM TO CAN BE MADE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH AUTHOR BUT WE RESPECTIVELY OPPOSED TO PROCESS CONTEMPLATED IN SB EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING OVER. THANK YOU. K. VERY WELL WE'LL GO TO A SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION YOU CAN LIMIT YOUR COMMENT YOUR NAME AFFILIATION POSITION ON THE BILL NO ONE HERE WILL GO TO THE PHONES MODERATOR PLEASE Q. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO ASK THE EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU. OKAY VERY GOOD- NO NONE AT ALL NONE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY WELL CAN I HAVE NO COMMENT WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE ANYONE HERE IN THE COMMITTEE. THE CENTRE BORCHERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHAT WITH FOLKS- ON FRANKLIN BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND- I WANTED TO POSE IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR- SOME QUESTIONS TO THE AUTHOR OF THE APPROPRIATE YES. THANK YOU. SO I'M TRYING TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THIS IS CONSOLIDATED INTO A DIGESTIBLE FORM I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT. AS WE IN THE SPECIALLY AS WE MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF- FLOATING- WIND. GENERATION WHICH I THINK SHOULD BE THE DIRECTION THAT WE ARE GOING AT LEAST FOR A COMPONENT OF OUR ENERGY NEEDS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH- ELECTRIFICATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO MOVE THAT TYPE. OF- TRANSMISSION. BUT I SO IT SEEMS THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS MORE OF A DIRECTIONAL POLICY DOCUMENT. TO THE P. YOU SEE. TO MAKE THE NECESSARY- POLICY AND- ADMINISTRATIVE. INVESTMENTS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THAT WE ARE KEEPING ELECTRIFICATION AT THE FOREFRONT OF BECAUSE THESE THINGS TAKE YEARS SOMETIMES DECADES. TO PUT INTO EFFECT. I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN IN MAYBE YOU CAN COMMENT PLEASE. IN WHAT FASHION DOES THIS INTERFERE OR CHALLENGE FOR OUR CREE BARRIERS FOR OUR TRADITIONAL EXTRACTION IN USAGE OF FOSSIL FUELS BECAUSE I THINK EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT ESPECIALLY AS WE'VE SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH YOUR CREAM- THAT. CALIFORNIANS MOVING- DRAMATICALLY IN THE DIVERSIFICATION ROUTE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO GREEN OVERNIGHT AND IT'S GOING TO BE IN WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE STILL HAVE A COMPONENT. OF OUR ENERGY NEEDS SATISFIED BY SOME OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL- ALSO FUEL EXTRACTION. SO MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHORS CAN YOU EXPLAIN EXACTLY HOW THIS DOCUMENT IF IT DOES- SO AT ALL. INTERFERES OR TAKES A POLICY POSITION THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE TRADITIONAL EXTRACTION INDUSTRIES. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND I JUST WANNA REITERATE THAT THIS. IN THIS BILL THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT TO STOP. USING GAS PLANTS DOESN'T FORCE ANY SHUTDOWNS- WHAT DOES IT SAY THAT IF THERE'S CLEAN ENERGY AVAILABLE ON THE GRID. THEN LET'S BUILD THE TRANSMISSION TO GET IT WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO. SO WE SHOULDN'T SAY WE NEED TO RELY ON THE GAS PLANTS AFTER THAT. I'M THE IF THERE'S CLEAN ENERGY AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE ON THE GRID SO IT REALLY YEAH YOU THINK YOUR POINT ABOUT PLANNING ABSOLUTELY. IT IS ABOUT PLANNING A FROM THE P. YOU SEE I'LL TRUST ONE OTHER- QUESTION ISN'T THAT WAS RAISED IN MY CLOTHES- BUT I THINK USE HEARD FROM ALL THE VOICES IN SUPPORT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THAT LONG TERM PLANNING HORIZON AND IT DOES YES AGAIN DOES NOT FORCE. SHUTDOWN OF ANY GAS RESOURCES OKAY. FORGIVE ME FOR FURTHER EMPHASIZING THIS POINT. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS TYPE OF DOCUMENT. THAT WOULD INSTRUCT THE P. YOU SEE FOR THEM ACTING ON AT THEIR OWN BEHEST. THAT IF THERE ARE TWO SOURCES OF ENERGY. EXISTING SIMULTANEOUSLY THAT ONE WOULD BE SEURE IN ONE WOULD BE SUBORDINATE BY VIRTUE OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. NO ARE THE FOCUS IS ON PREPARING TRANSMISSIONS THAT WE CAN DELIVER CLEAN ENERGY AS IT IS BUILT- SO YEAH THE ANSWER QUESTIONS NO- IT DOES NOT JUST% RIGHT NOW WE CAN BILL OF THE CLEAN ENERGY WE WANT WE JUST CAN'T GET IT TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE. AND SO THEREFORE WE'RE GONNA STOP BUILDING AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN GERMANY IT'S THE SAME THING THAT USED UP ALL MOST THEY'RE GOOD- YOU KNOW THEY'RE EASY TO BUILD- AT LOCATIONS AND NOW THEY'RE CLEAN ENERGY- BUILDINGS ACTUALLY GOING DOWN. ON AND WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID THAT MAKE SURE WE PLANTS WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE TRANSMISSION ALL THIS OFF SHORE WIND ALL THIS THAT WE WANT TO BUILD. ON WHAT I CAN DO A BILL THAT UNLESS WE HAVE THIS IN A LONG RANGE PLANNING HORIZON. OKAY THIS IS CERTAINLY A TOUCHY TOPIC AS YOU COULD IMAGINE I REPRESENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND WE STILL HAVE. BY I KNOW OF PLAYERS. IN THE TRADITIONAL. EXTRACTION INDUSTRY. THEY THEY- LITERALLY ARE THE VANGUARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL- A BY THIS WHEN IT COMES TO ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND LAWS. AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICAL AND SOLAR AND- WIND. AND MAKING THIS THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF CALIFORNIANS- ENERGY SYSTEM- SO I WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT. AS I SUPPORT THIS TODAY IF THIS DOES CHANGE. IN A FASHION WHERE. WE ARE FORCIBLY SUBORDINATING. OUR TRADITIONAL EXTRACTION INDUSTRY OF. REGULAR IN A REGULATORY SYSTEM AWARDED MINISTRY TO SYSTEM I DON'T THINK I'D BE IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT OF IT APPEARS THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT NOW. THAT THIS IS SIMPLY EVOLVING THE PUC'S ARE- IT MINISTRY OF PAPERWORK AND- IT'S RESOURCE ALLOCATION DOING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF OFFSHORE WIND. AND I THINK WITHOUT BEING IN MIND I'D BE WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY ASSUMING IT DOES NOT CHANGE MOVING FORWARD. BOB SENATOR DOLLY. MY UP THANK YOU. HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR SO RESULT. TURNER'S SECOND CA FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR IN THE BILL FOR THE GETS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN WAY OVERDUE CALIFORNIA WE ARE OVER PRODUCING- GREEN ENERGY AND AREAS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY EXPORTING IT TO OTHER STATES AND OUR RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING FOR IT- TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THERE ARE RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING AND WE'RE SENDING ENERGY TO ARIZONA AND OTHER PLACES SO I LIKE THAT PART OF THE BILL. A COUPLE QUESTIONS THOUGH ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS- MUNICIPALITIES THAT- BY ENERGY BY THAT ENERGY- FROM. THE SUPPLY THAT'S AVAILABLE IN. WITHIN THEIR GRID AREA. AND THOSE ARE PURCHASE POWER AGREEMENTS. AND THAT SOME OF THOSE AGREEMENTS- ART. SOMETIMES TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS LONG SO IF YOU. ARE A E. CCA AND YOU'VE ACQUIRED POWER FROM. WHATEVER SOURCE IT IS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S NOW A NEW TRANSMISSION LINE. IT DOESN'T NEED YOUR POWER IN YOUR BRING IN THAT POWER FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE UTILITY IS STILL ON THE HOOK FOR THAT PURCHASE POWER AGREEMENT THAT WAS AVAILABLE. AT THE TIME WHEN THEY HAD TO SECURE POWER FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE- CONTRACTS- GOING FORWARD IF THE TRANSMISSION LINES BUILT. AND THEY DON'T NEED THAT POWER ANYMORE. WELL FIRST OF ALL THANKS FOR FIRST PARTNER COMMENTS AND I'M PRETTY SURE NO YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS TRANSMISSION. ISSUE IN THE PAST DON'T GAS FROM EXPERTS. I THINK ONE OF THE ANSWER IS THAT- ALL THIS ENERGY CAN BE NEEDED RIGHT OUT THERE I DON'T SEE A FIRST YEAR. A SITUATION WHERE IT WON'T BE BUT LET ME ASK STEVE ME TAG TO SEE IF HE HAS A COMMENT ON THAT. A QUESTION. SURE THANK YOU. YES I THINK- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THE- IDEA THAT- THERE IS. A GROWING NEED FOR ADDITIONAL NEW CLEAN ENERGY AND THIS- TRANSMISSION THAT'S- INSPIRED BY THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT- EXISTING. POWER PURCHASE WAS MADE TO GO AWAY- HOPEFULLY WE'LL STILL BE ECONOMIC IN THIS ENVIRONMENT BUT- NEW TRANSMISSION. FOR NEW GENERATION REALLY AN ANSWER MY QUESTION BECAUSE THERE ARE CONTRACTS OUT THEN I'M OUT I KNOW THIS BECAUSE WE WERE FACING THAT SO I'M JUST GONNA I'M SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN ANSWER WHEN WE COME BACK TO THE TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE I'M AN ASSET TO WIN AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S VERY CRITICAL YUP THE COST TO THE CONSUMER THAT ALREADY ON THE HOOK FOR SOME OTHERS- SOURCE OF ENERGY. ON THAT SO I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND I HEARD THAT BEFORE I'M ALL FOR. THE OTHER THERE'S ONE OTHER QUESTION ONE ISSUE THAT. YOU'RE FORCING THE PC TO MAKE THE DECISION ON TWO LINES. AND IT HAS BEEN AN AMENDMENT ON THAT. POINT COMMENSURATE YEAH SO IT JUST DIDN'T GET INTO PRINT FOR THE ORIGINALLY WE DID HAVE THAT CONCEPT IN THE BILL- BUT IT HAS BEEN AMENDED TO. SAY THAT THE CASE SO- CONSIDER APPROVING AT LEAST ONE. THE WAY WE WENT FOR THE LANGUAGE OF APPROVED AT LEAST TO HIGH PARTY PROJECTS TO CONSIDER APPROVING AT LEAST ONE THAT AMENDMENT BUT ALONG THOSE LINES. YOU KNOW IT. WE SHOULD LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S A WHOLE AND FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE OVER PRODUCING. GREEN ENERGY AND WE NEEDED TO GET TO SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT SHOULD BE THE PRIORITY THAT SHOULD BE DONE BY THE CPUC. WHICH UNFORTUNATELY HASN'T BEEN DONE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE RUNNING THIS BILL TO SAY HEY. WE NEED TO GO DO THAT SO. I'M THOSE ARE THE THINGS I'M GONNA BE LOOKING FOR WHEN WE COME BACK- SO. WHAT'S THE PRIORITY WHICH AREAS- THAT THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ARE OVER GENERATING. AND GETTING INTO AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THAT SAME- ABILITY TO GENERATE SO THAT WE- WE CAN ACTUALLY BALANCE THE GRID. WITH GREEN ENERGY. AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T LEAVE SOMEBODY WAS STRANDED ASSETS- THAT A PROCURED ENERGY. FOR LONG HAUL AND I THINK IF THAT WAS THE CASE THE SPEAKER PLANT FOLKS. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM WHOLE THEY BUILT THESE PLANTS. AND INVESTED MONEY EXPECTING. A CONTRACT SOMEWHERE IF THAT CHANGES THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE MADE WHOLE. THANK YOU AND AGAIN I GOTTA COME INTO AT THE EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE GOING TO BE HONORABLE CLARIFY WITH YOU BUT DON'T FEEDBACK I'VE GOTTEN. FROM FOLKS WHO WORK WITH EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE GOING TO BE HONORED JUST WHEN YOU NEED TO BUY NEW ENERGY. THEN REMOVING THE TRANSMISSION CONSTRAINTS GIVES YOU MORE CHOICES. AND THE SECOND PART OF A SAID ABSOLUTELY I NEED WE NEED TO DO THAT MAP. AND I THINK THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR EXAMPLE VIA. THE BIG BENEFIT SURE OF THIS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE LIMIT TRANSITION FROM THOSE AREAS- THAT PREVENT THEM FROM SELLING CLEAN ENERGY TO CUSTOMERS AND- IN CITY SO. A GROUP BOTH THROUGH THAT WE DO NEED TO DO THAT PLANNING AND I THINK THE SENSE OF I WILL BE A BENEFIT SURE OF THAT. AND IF I MIGHT SUGGEST IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE PULLED. WHO WOULDN'T STOP. ALLOWING GENERATION TO BE PROCURED IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE. TOO MUCH ALREADY. THAT WOULD REALLY BE BOLD BECAUSE THEN. WE COULD ACTUALLY DRIVE THE COST DOWN FOR CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE GETTING A TAX REBATE. ON BUILDING THEIR SOLAR INCENTIVIZE FORD OR WIND. AND THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT AREA SO. IT'S A MATTER OF BALANCING THAT GREAT OUT SO APPRECIATE YOUR BILL AND LOOKING FOR THE DETAILS WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. BILL MOTION BY SENATOR STERN BACK IN IF I COULD JUST ADD COMMENTS BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE GONE THROUGH- A REVIEW OF THIS PROCESS VERY THOROUGH CIRCUITS IN THIS BILL GENERALLY IS- QUITE. NONSPECIFIC ON A LOT OF ISSUES AND I THINK THE LEGISLATURE DOES NEED TO GET SPECIFIC WHEN IT COMES TO- HOW HOW WE INVEST IN PLANNING BECAUSE AGAIN ALL OF THIS. HAS A RETURN ON COST. I DO WANNA BEGIN BY POINTING OUT THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS- PROPOSED AND IF I CAN JUST CORRECT. SENATOR BAKER A BIT ON THE AMENDMENT ALL READ IT JUST SO IT'S CLEAR EVERYBODY'S MINE WHAT THE AMENDMENT IS THE FIRST AMENDMENT. WAS REFERENCED- AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S READ ACCURATELY INTO THE RECORD. IT DELETES REFERENCE TO REQUIRING THE CHI SO TO APPROVE TWO OR MORE PROJECTS. TWO OR MORE- WITH LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS A CASUAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER PROJECTS NEED TO BE APPROVED FOR INCORPORATION INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO SLASH TWENTY THREE TRANSMISSION PLAN. AND JUST GENERALLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY- COST ANALYSIS ON THIS AND I THINK THAT IS AGAIN WE HAVE TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO HOW. WE INVEST IN OUR- RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO THAT WITH THAT WE LIMIT- THAT WE REALLY MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS IN TERMS OF BENEFIT TO THE SYSTEM COST BENEFIT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT. AND OFTEN TIMES A WEEK WE THINK LESS ABOUT THE COST BENEFIT WHICH IS SET RATES CAR WASH CORRUPTION YOU MEANT YOU MENTIONED. A COASTAL WIND POWER BAND I JUST RAISES LOTS OF RED FLAGS TO ME BECAUSE CITING- WIND POWER IN THE CALIFORNIA COASTLINE IS GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT THING. ESPECIALLY FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND HOW TO CREATE THOSE CONNECTIONS TO THE MAINLAND. IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY EXTREMELY COSTLY. AND SOMEWHAT OF A RISK- SO. A SECOND AB MENTIONED ARE WE GONNA START- A PLANNING FOR THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE'S AN IMPACT OR NOT I THINK WE SHOULD KNOW THAT AS LEGISLATURE AND I HOPE. THAT WE COULD COME TO SOME UNDERSTANDING BEFORE THIS BILL IS SENT TO THE GOVERNOR. ON WHAT WE MEAN BY- THE LONG TERM PLANNING AND OF COURSE THE ADJUSTMENT- REQUIRED ALLOWS FOR THAT PLANNING PROCESS TO BE UNDERTAKEN BUT AT SOME POINT. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT BUT WERE WERE ASKING. THE PETER YOU KNOW CRY SO. AND THE CPUC TO DO HERE SO AGAIN ASIDE ASIDE LIKE TO AFFORD MY COLLEAGUES THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THEIR BILLS. I SUPPORT THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN START TO ADDRESS KIND OF THE FINER TUNING OF THE DETAILS OF THE BILL- IF THERE ARE NO MORE COMMENTS. DID YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS NO THANK YOU YOUR CLARIFICATION- I THINK ADDRESSED ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WAS RAISED I APPRECIATE YOU STATING THAT AMENDMENT AND FOR ALL THE WORK ON THE BILL. ESPECIALLY AS FROM ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION. FRAZIER WAS OUR MOTION. THERE WAS A MOTION BY SENATOR STERN. THANK CHAIR.

I'M HAPPY GO THROUGH THOSE DETAILS WITH YOU ALL BUT- FIRST AMENDMENT SWAPS OUT THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION PREPARING THE REPORT IN THE SECOND EXTEND THE DEADLINE FOR THE REPORTS- FROM. JULY TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- MEMBERS. SB ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR PERMANENT PROMOTES CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. BY ENSURING THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE SOME INITIAL STEPS TO DEVELOP ELECTRONIC REGISTRIES. RACK AC HEATING H. BACK EQUIPMENT SALES TO INSURANCE DOLLARS COMPLY WITH PERMANENT CODE REQUIREMENTS AND PROVIDE TITLE TWENTY FOUR ENERGY CODE COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION. SENSUALLY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF H. BACK UNITS ACROSS CALIFORNIA NOT BE INSTALLED PROPERLY THEY'RE NOT GOING THROUGH THE PROPER PERMITTING PROCESS WE DON'T RECORD ACTUALLY KNOW WHERE THEY'RE BEING INSTALLED- AND WHEN THEY'RE INSTALLED IMPROPERLY SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET- INCREASED ENERGY USE UP TO TWENTY OR THIRTY PERCENT- PER HOUSEHOLD- WE'RE WE WERE FINDING THAT. TELL TWENTY FOUR IS ALSO NOT BEING COMPLIED WITH VERY OFTEN REFERRED TO AS LITTLE AS HAVE UN PERMITTED H. FAQ INSTALLATIONS GOING ON THEY'RE DONE WITH. POOR QUALITY- WITH POOR EFFICIENCY- THE RATEPAYERS OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY NEED WILL AIR IN THEIR PLACES TO SURVIVE OR EVER HOTTER SUMMERS AND- WINTERS AS WELL- ARE GETTING LEFT AT THE BACK. SO IT'S TIME TO PROVIDE SOME CLEAR DIRECTION TO SEE SEE THAT THEY'RE EMPOWERED TO MOVE AND MOVE QUICKLY ON TAKING AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS TO IMPROVE ENERGY CODE COMPLIANCE. WE'RE DIRECTING AGENCIES TO COME BACK TO US. WITH FORTY FOUR PROPOSALS THE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND CONTRACTORS AND LOCAL BUILDING OFFICIALS. AND IDENTIFY BUDGET NEEDS ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS AND ANY ACTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED OVERCOME BARRIERS WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF MY CO SPONSORS.

I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL YES WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE PRESENTATIONS IN SUPPORT. THE NEW. ENOUGH SO WE WILL GRANT- THE SPEAKERS. IN IN SUPPORT EACH A MINUTE AND A HALF FOR THE ORGANIZED PRESENTATIONS MISTER WELCH YOUR FIRST ONLINE MISTER CHAIRMAN A MEMBER SCOTT WHAT SHOULD BE A FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL. TITLE TWENTY FOUR IS THE WAY THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA- INSURER ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS IN THE WAY THAT WE SURE THAT WE REDUCE OUR OUR OUR CARBON OUTPUT- THE WAY WE ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH TITLE TWENTY FOUR IS THROUGH THE BUILDING PERMIT AND BUILDING INSPECTION PROCESS UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE FOR OVER A DECADE. UPWARDS OF 90% OF THE- H. RACK INSTALLATIONS IN CALIFORNIA CIRCUMVENT THE PERMITTING PROCESS THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO TRY TO CREATE A REGISTRY SO WE CAN ENSURE THAT TITLE TWENTY FOURS ENFORCED. AND WE ACTUALLY GET THE ENERGY SAVINGS THAT YOU ALL HAVE- SOUGHT THROUGH- MANY MANY VERY FINE PIECES OF LEGISLATION SO WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS THOMAS AND- AND SLOW. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN STATES ACCOUNTS OF SHEET METAL WORKERS. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS TWO RELATED PROBLEMS LACK OF PERMIT COMPLIANCE AND THEN A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT EVEN WHEN PERMITS ARE PULLED- THE- ENERGY COMMISSION JUST HAD A WORKSHOP LAST WEEK ON PERMIT COMPLIANCE IN WHICH- A BUILDING OFFICIALS TESTIFIED THAT. ENERGY CODE COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR LOWEST PRIORITY AND MANY OF THEM DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE TITLE TWENTY FOUR COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION BECAUSE IT'S TOO BURDENSOME. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ARE GREAT- SYSTEMS THAT WILL BOTH IMPROVE COMPLIANCE AND SIMPLIFY ENFORCEMENT. REQUIRES TWO RELATED REPORTS OF FOUR FOUR PLANS ONE WILL PROPOSE A PLAN FOR TOTAL TWENTY FOUR ENERGY CODE COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION REGISTRY. THAT MAKES US ABOUT A BUILDING OFFICIALS SO THEY CAN SIMPLY RIGHT IN THE ADDRESS OF THE BUILDING THAT THEIR- INSPECTION AND GET VERIFICATION THAT ALL OF THE TOTAL TWENTY FOUR ACCEPTANCE TESTINGS IN COMPLIANCE. THE DOCUMENTS INSTALLATION. DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN. CREDIT AND SOME CORRECT. AND THIS HELP US CREATE- COMPLIANCE EVEN THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT CURRENT LOOK AT ANY CODE AND- AS LOWEST PER CASH. AT ALL. ALLOWS US TO AND THAT- COMPLIANCE WITH PERMITS BY HAVING AN EXPECTED SALES REGISTER DOWN THE LINK TO THIS TOWN TWENTY FOUR COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION REGISTRY YOU CAN TELL IF SOMEONE BOUGHT. WOMEN AND LATER ON NEVER GETS PUT INTO THE SYSTEM AS ACTUALLY HAVING COMPLIED WITH THE PERMIT AND TITLE TWENTY FOUR COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTS WE CAN NOW ACTUALLY. FIND THAT OUT IN FORCE IT GIVES HIS ALL BE A TOOL TO ACTUALLY EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WE'RE NOW WE HAVE 90% OF- H.

THAT WERE I WORKED OUT YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND SHARED WITH THE FULL COMMITTEE HAVE A GET INTO THOSE DETAILS- AT YOUR DISCRETION- MISTER CHAIR- BUT- IN SHORT THIS BILL IS DEALING WITH. THE TIP OF THE SPEAR FOR A CLIMATE EMERGENCY WHICH- IN MANY CASES PEOPLE THINK IS WILD FIRE FLOOD OR SEA LEVEL RISE BUT HE- HE IS THE GREAT SECRET KILLER IN CALIFORNIA- TO TRACK THE- IMPACTS OF HE- WHEN YOU HAVE A BE ONE THEIR CONDITIONING UNIT ISN'T WORKING. OUT WHEN YOU HAVE A FEW WHEN YOU CAN'T COOL OFF AT NIGHT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ELDERLY OR PEOPLE WITH HEART CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTANT MOTHERS- THIS IS THE CHALLENGE WE'RE FACING IN CALIFORNIA. AS WE GO THROUGH A GREAT TRYING. ACCORDING TO GOVERNOR'S TRACKED EXTREME HEAT REPORT WE'RE GONNA SEE- INCREASES OF UP TO FIVE SIX DEGREES FOR EIGHT AVERAGE DAILY MAX TEMPERATURE I'M THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THAT COULD BEING APPROACHING THE ONE THIRTY RANGE IN OUR LIFETIME. HARD TO IMAGINE BUT WE THINK WE NEED TO TACKLE THIS AND WE THINK THIS BILL IS A CRITICAL PART OF IT- WILL INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT A LOT OF SOLUTIONS TO EXTREME HEAT. BUT BUT THIS BILL REALLY TACKLES THE BUILDING PORTION OF IT WE'RE LOOKING AT RETROFITS INCENTIVES TO HELP LOW INCOME FAMILIES RETROFIT THEIR H. FAQ UNITS TO ALLOW A COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AND INDUSTRIAL USERS- TO INSTALL NEW EFFICIENT APPLIANCES AND PUMPS- AND WE THINK HAVING LATER PUT THEIR- THEIR FOOT PRINT ON THIS WORK I REALLY MATTERS AND TO THAT EXTENT I APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMITTEES TARGETING- WE'RE LOOKING AT LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN PARTICULAR- MORE PUBLIC PROCESS IN THAT REGARD- EXPLICITLY TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF ELECTRIC HEAT PUMPS. AMONG THE MEASURES ARE TO BE FOCUSED ON HERE I'LL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION RESOURCE AGENCY AND OF COURSE THIS COMMITTEE AND YOU ALL MEMBERS- TO DEVELOP THIS LEGISLATION WITH ME TESTIFYING REMOTELY YEARS MARRIED FOR JUSTIN WITH NRDC RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU ON THE COMMITTEE ARE LIKE SENATOR STERN DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF INCREASINGLY EXTREME HEAT OUR COMMUNITY THINK CALIFORNIA. I DO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AND TO COMPARE FOR THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING. IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WOULD DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS AS WELL THE DRAFT INCOME AND HOUSING THE FERRY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING EXTREME HEAT. THE BILL PROPOSES A PROGRAM THAT COMBINES MEASURES THAT WOULD REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGH ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION ALONG WITH PROVIDING EFFICIENT COOLING AND OTHER MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE COMFORT OF HOME. ENERGY HE LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR TO FURTHER DEVELOP THIS BILL AND TO INSURE THE BEST PROGRAM COMPLEMENT OTHER EXISTING STATE PROGRAM. THAT INCLUDES DIRECT PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND CORPORATE IT PROTECTION I'M INTO THAT THE PROGRAM. WE ENCOURAGE HER AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU.

YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO MY DISTRICT BECAUSE I HAVE- PORTIONS OF MY DISTRICT GEOGRAPHICALLY THAT. ARE LOCATED WITHIN- SOME. AREAS GEOGRAPHICALLY THAT- FACE EXTREME WEATHER SO I HAVE MOUNTAINS WHICH OFTEN GET VERY COLD AND I HAVE THE DESERT'S WHICH- ARE US SOME OF THE HOTTEST LOCATIONS IN THE WORLD SO. THESE THESE I OFTEN ASK. YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE WHEN IN THE SUMMER WHEN WE'RE RUNNING ALL THE H. C. WHAT IS THE IMPACT TO THE ENVIRONMENT OF ALL THAT. THERE IS AN ENORMOUS IMPACT AND CAN WE MITIGATE THAT AND REDUCE THAT AND STILL UP PROVIDE. LIVABLE ENVIRONMENTS FOR PEOPLE THAT SOMETIMES NEED TO LIVE. IN THESE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS YES SO- THIS IS A GREAT BILL. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS BILL BUT I DO. THINK THAT- I THINK YOU KNOW WE NEED TO WORK ON- CREATING SOME GUIDANCE.

BILL RELATING TO RESOURCE ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS FOR ELECTRICITY. THANK YOU SURCHARGE FOR FIRST LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AS SET FORTH IN THE ANALYSIS. THANK. GET THAT MR YES OKAY THANK YOU I'M- YOU KNOW ONE. START JUST VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE I LEFT GOVERNMENT FOR TWELVE YEARS WERE TRAVELING THE WORLD WORKING IN. THE AREA OF ENVIRONMENT IN CLEAN TECH ALL OVER THE PLANET ONE OF THE REASONS I CAME BACK TO GOVERNMENT WAS TO WORK ON THE DETAILS THAT AREN'T THE HEADLINE GRABBING DETAILS THAT PUT ALL THESE GREAT NUMBERS OUT THERE IN THESE GREAT. GOALS AND LOFTY GOALS BUT TO DEAL WITH THE DETAILS TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE TO DEAL WITH THE KINDS OF CHANGES THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK SO ALTHOUGH THIS IS ONE OF THE LEAST ATTENTION GRABBING BILLS I WOULD SUGGEST. IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. CALIFORNIA IS FACING AS WE KNOW AND PRESIDENT NEED FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES. TO POWER THE STATE'S ELECTRIC IT OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS ARE PS REQUIREMENTS WHICH WE DID WHEN I WAS SPEAKER CONSUMER DEMANDS. FOR CLEAN ENERGY AND RAPID TRANSPORTATION LIKE TO VACATION. ALL CALL FOR A TOTAL TRANSFORMATION OF OUR ENTIRE ELECTRIC SECTOR. A NEW DEAL A NEW DEAL FOR ELECTRIC GOOD IF YOU WILL. GET ALL OVER AMBITIOUS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS ARE NOTHING NOTHING MORE THAN GOALS WITHOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO DELIVER THAT CLEAN POWER. CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY NEEDS MORE CLEAN POWER WE NEED A MODERN TRANSMISSION SYSTEM THAT CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER IT TO EVERY COMMUNITY ACROSS THE STATE. WE'VE ALREADY EXPERIENCE WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN OUR GREAT IS NOT EQUIPPED TO MEET THAT DEMAND. THE ROTATING ALLERGIES THE LAST FEW YEARS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT VULNERABILITIES IN A RELIABILITY OF OUR ELECTRICAL SUPPLY. ANY PROLONGED FREQUENT OR UNPLANNED INTERRUPTION WILL CREATE A BACKLASH AMONG CUSTOMERS AND PUT THE ENTIRE THE ENTIRETY OF OUR CLIMATE GOALS AT RISK POLITICALLY. SO WE NEED TO GET TO WORK SHORTFALLS IN OUR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND EXECUTION IS OUR BIGGEST BURIED REPLACING FOSSIL FUEL RESOURCES CURRENTLY MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM'S RELIABILITY. IN THE NEAR TERM MEMBERS MANY TRANSMISSION PROJECTS WE NEED TO MEET OUR CAPACITY NOW FACE THE COST RATHER THAN FACE COSTLY SETBACKS WITH NO REAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACCOUNTABILITY OR OVERSIGHT BY OUR STATE. IN THE LONG TERM WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THE- JUST IN TIME CYCLE OF PROCUREMENT TRANSPORTATION SHE'S ME AND TRANSMISSION BUILD OUT WE MUST ESTABLISH A ROBUST PROCESS FOR LONG TERM LEAD RESOURCES WHICH TAKES EIGHT TO TEN YEARS TO COMPLETE I REPEAT. EIGHT TO TEN YEARS TO COMPLETE THE SAID THE APPROPRIATE MARKET SIGNALS TO ENSURE RELIABILITY MOVING FORWARD THIS MEASURE SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WILL CONNECT THE STATE'S BOLD PLANNING PLANS FOR ELECTRIFYING OUR ECONOMY WITH COMMONSENSE POLICIES. RAMPING UP CLEAN ENERGY AND MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRED TO POWER A CLEANER GREENER CALIFORNIA. TO WITNESSES TESTIFYING TODAY MICHAEL COLVIN FROM THE ENVIRONMENT DEFENSE FUND AND CAMERON.
