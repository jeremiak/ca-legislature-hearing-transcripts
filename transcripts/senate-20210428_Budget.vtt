00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:56.168
DISK CLEANUP. IS TRYING TO MAKE

00:08:56.235 --> 00:08:57.236
SOMETHING BETTER THAT FAILED

00:08:57.303 --> 00:09:00.506
LAST YEAR. IT ONLY FAILS IT

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:03.876

00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:05.444
ALIGNMENT OF THE JUVENILE

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:08.080
JUSTICE SYSTEM. IS WHAT THIS

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:10.182
ADMINISTRATION AND THE PREVIOUS

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:13.152
ONES HAVE BEEN APPLYING. THE

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.154
RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL AND

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:18.124
STATE GOVERNMENT. I CALL IT THE

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.326

GOVERNMENTS. AND ONE OF THE KEY

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:34.740
ELEMENTS THAT FAILS IN THIS.

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:38.277
THE WORD RECIDIVISM IS A JOKE.

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:39.912
THE ONLY REASON THAT THIS BILL

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:42.114
WILL BE FACT IN THE LAST BILL

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:44.216
LAST YEAR AFFECTED A DECLINE

00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:45.785
RECIDIVISM IS THERE WILL BE NO

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:47.320
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ANYBODY WHO

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:50.523
CONTINUES A CRIMINOLOGY. SO FOR

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:53.459

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:54.860
THEREFORE THEY DID NOT RECEIVE

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:59.098
A- IT REMOVES ALL ARE GREATLY

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:01.400
DIMINISHES THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:03.369
OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:07.073
REHABILITATION. WHY BECAUSE

THE JOB. THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:20.019
IN FACT THE JUVENILE JUSTICE

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:23.389

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.257

ABILITY TO RELY ON EXISTING

THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND THERE

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:22.227
ARE CERTAIN TIME LINES AROUND.

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:24.296
AND THAT FACILITY FREE THAT

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:27.366

YOU'RE RIGHT NOW I DON'T RECALL

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:38.644
THERE BEING A SPECIFIC DATE BY

FACILITIES UP AND RUNNING.

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:45.918
ZACKS SOME OF THAT WOULD BE

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:47.953
DEPENDENT ON HOW THE CORDS

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.254

THEM IN. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.804
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:06.838
PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:07.706
YOU'RE REFERRING BUT I THINK

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:09.041
THAT THERE'S ANY SPECIFIC

00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:10.976
TIMELINE WHICH COUNTIES NEED TO

00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:17.783
THAT USE WOULD BE COMING TO

BUILD YOU THIS OR- AMOUNT BY

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.707
THE SPECIFIC DATE. I APOLOGIZE

HOW BEAUTIFUL UP WITH YOU

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:44.710
SENATOR GIRLS I'M NOT OF A BUT

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:46.712
DEEPER. TO BOARD AND THEY SAID

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:47.946
THEY THERE IS A REQUIREMENT

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:49.514
JULY TWENTY TWO THREE THE BOARD

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:53.018
OF STATE. KERR WOULD- REVIEW X.

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:53.852
STANDARDS AND CONSIDER

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.854
MODIFYING THEM AND THERE'S A

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.990
THERE'S A NUMBER OF TIME LINES

00:20:58.056 --> 00:20:58.724
AROUND KIND OF ESTABLISHED AN

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.726
OFFENSE BEATS ME. I NOT AWARE

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:02.527
OF A PROVISION IN THE BILL AT

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.496
THIS POINT AS I SAY HERE THAT.

00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:06.765
COUNTY TO A STEP. SECURE YOU

00:21:06.832 --> 00:21:07.966

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:12.504
SPECIFIC TIME WHEN OTHER. THE

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:13.605
ON. FOR THE PURPOSES OF SERVING

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:16.608
ID WHICH ON JULY FIRST OF YEAR.

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:17.142
OKAY SO I GUESS THAT'S MY

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:17.776
BECAUSE THE WAY THAT READ THE

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:19.411
BILL OR THE BILL IS PRESENTED

00:21:19.478 --> 00:21:21.046
TO US BEFORE US TODAY IT SAYS

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.248
THAT ACCORDING TO THE LANGUAGE

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:25.884
IT CONTINUES AND THAT THE- WE

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.086
HAVE TWO OR THE COUNTIES. HAVE

00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:29.187
TO EITHER PROVIDE SECURE

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:32.391
FACILITIES BY JULY FIRST TWENTY

00:21:32.457 --> 00:21:34.092
TWENTY THREE OR CONTRACT OUT

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:35.560
FOR THE SERVICES FOR THESE.

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:39.931
PARTICULAR USE- BUT IT ALSO

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:45.137
SAYS. WE NEED A CORRECTIONS HAS

00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:47.172
UNTIL JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:48.740
THREE WHICH IS THE SAME DATE TO

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:50.876
ESTABLISH THE STANDARDS. SO I'M

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:52.444
I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT THE

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:54.212
COUNTY HAS A CONTRACT DAY TO

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:56.348
CONTRACT THEM OUT OR BUILD A

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:57.516
FACILITY THAT HOUSES THESE

00:21:57.582 --> 00:22:00.419
INDIVIDUALS- THAT WERE SO BAD

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:01.753
THEY ACTUALLY GOT CARVED OUT OF

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.157
THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND- ON THE

00:22:05.223 --> 00:22:07.325
SAME DATE SO YOU'RE EXPECTING

00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:08.293
THE COUNTIES BASED ON THE BILL

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.328
LANGUAGE BEFORE US THAT. THESE

00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:11.329
COUNTIES HAVE TO HAVE THE

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:12.931
SECURE FACILITIES UP AND

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.900
RUNNING BY JULY FIRST TWENTY

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:16.468
TWENTY THREE OR CONTRACT OUT.

00:22:16.535 --> 00:22:18.937
AND THEN ALSO THE STANDARDS TO

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.105
OPERATE THOSE FACILITIES OR

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.907
BUILD THAT FACILITY OR TO MEET

00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:23.975
THE NEEDS OF THESE USE- DON'T

00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:25.677
EVEN HAVE TO BE ESTABLISHED

00:22:25.744 --> 00:22:27.212
UNTIL JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:28.513
THREE WHICH IS. THE EXACT SAME

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.083
DATE SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS

00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:32.818
WORKS ON THE GROUND PER SE. I

00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:34.252
UNDERSTAND I THINK I AM IF I

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:35.620
CAN JUST QUICKLY CLARIFY I

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:36.988
THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.457
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT COUNTIES

00:22:38.523 --> 00:22:38.924
ARE GOING TO GO ABOUT

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.425
ESTABLISHING. SECURITY IS

00:22:40.492 --> 00:22:42.294
TREATMENT FACILITIES I THINK

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.196
SENATOR GROVE IN YOUR EXAMPLE

00:22:44.262 --> 00:22:45.397
YOU'RE ASSUMING A COUNTY WOULD

00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:47.532
CONSTRUCT A BRAND NEW FACILITY

00:22:47.599 --> 00:22:48.533
FROM THE GROUND UP TO MEET THAT

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.901
REQUIREMENT. THAT'S CERTAINLY

00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:51.870
NOT WHAT'S REQUIRED IN THE

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:53.105
LEGISLATION THE LEGISLATION

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:55.640
SIMPLY ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK-

00:22:55.707 --> 00:23:00.479
FOR HOW CAN YOU CAN OPERATE THE.

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:02.114
SECURE YOU FACILITIES.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.949
COMPANIES HAVE THIS YEAR FOR

00:23:04.015 --> 00:23:05.016
STRUCTURE THAT THERE SERVING

00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:08.754
YOU THAT ARE. TO THE- AND- THE-

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.056
HOUSE NOT KIND OF RUN THE GAMUT

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:13.325
OF OR HOW DO. THAT RUN THE DAY.

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:15.460
AND OF THIS. THAT ARE BEING. SO

00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:18.163
I SEE THAT. GOAL HERE TO

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.632
ESTABLISH THAT. TO ALLOW

00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:22.901
COUNTIES FLAG. TO APPLY THAT

00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:24.803
FOR WORK IN THE IN TWO. KIND

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:25.403
WHICH MEANS THAT THEY MAY OR

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.606
MAY NOT. TO CONSTRUCT NEW FOR.

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:30.275
IN THE NEAR TERM. THE BOARD

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:31.143
SEATING CAN YOU KERR. IS

00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:32.844
REALIZE EXIST STAN THAT IT. FOR

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:35.013
JUVENILE. AND OTHER. YOUTH

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.515
FACILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:38.083
BEING USED TO SERVE YOU WITH.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.351
AND WITH THE IDEA THAT THERE

00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:40.719
MIGHT BE MODIFICATIONS TO THOSE

00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:42.587
STANDARDS AND SPECIFIC TO

00:23:42.654 --> 00:23:43.522
SECURE YOUR TREATMENT

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:49.861
FACILITIES. BUT JUST. TO YOU

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:52.497
CAN OF REFLECTED BY AT IT IN.

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:53.231
IT MAY NOT BE EVERY COW IS

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:55.267
GOING CONSTRUCT BRAND FOR. TO

00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:57.302
MEET THAT. THAT SYSTEM IN THE

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:59.337
BILL- I DON'T THAT THEY'RE

00:23:59.404 --> 00:23:59.905
GONNA CA. BRAND NEW FACILITY

00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:00.772
IT'S JUST AN OPTION IF THEY DO

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.307
BUT THEY- HAVE TO EITHER

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:04.176
CONTRACT OUT OR USE EXISTING

00:24:04.242 --> 00:24:07.212
FACILITIES AND TO- TAKE IN.

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:09.281
THESE HIGH RISK VERY HIGH RISK

00:24:09.347 --> 00:24:12.350
INCARCERATED USE. AND ONE OF

00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:13.952
THE THINGS THAT THAT BOTHERED

00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:15.220
ME ABOUT THE LANGUAGES OF THE

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:16.955
DATES WERE JUST SIMULTANEOUSLY

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:18.957
TO SOMETHING THAT I NOTICED SO-

00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:20.392
THEY HAVE TO HAVE EITHER A NEW

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:21.760
FACILITY BUILT AN EXISTING

00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:24.229
FACILITY MODIFIED. BY JULY

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:26.264
FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUT

00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:26.998
YET THE STATE BOARD OF

00:24:27.065 --> 00:24:28.266
COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS ISN'T

00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:30.035
EVEN GOING TO COME OUT WITHTHE

00:24:34.372 --> 00:24:34.873
TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO IT I

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.941
THINK ON THE GROUND IT MAKES IT

00:24:36.007 --> 00:24:37.509
A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR COUNTIES

00:24:37.576 --> 00:24:39.544
TO COMPLY AT ALL. THANK YOU FOR

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:42.480
