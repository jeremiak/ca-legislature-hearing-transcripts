AND LATINO BLACK ASIAN. LBGT Q.

00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:57.914
CREW ON THE SET AND I BELIEVE

00:51:57.981 --> 00:51:59.115
THE HAIR AND MAKE UP LOCAL HAS

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:00.784
DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF

00:52:00.851 --> 00:52:03.453
EXPANDING INTO A MORE. DIVERSE

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.655
MEMBERSHIP. I'M NOT USUALLY THE

00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:07.557
ONLY LATINA IN THEIR DEPARTMENT

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:09.292
HOWEVER WHERE I HAVE SEEN LESS

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:11.795
CHANGE IS LIKE WHICH I'M GOING

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:13.730
TO ECHO WHAT GREAT WOMEN BEFORE

00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:15.432
MAY HAVE SAID. OUR THE PEOPLE

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.534
IN CHARGETHAT MEANS PRODUCERS

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:20.270
EXECUTIVE STUDIO HEADS SHOW

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:21.371
RUNNERS. THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:23.240
HIRING AND DECIDE WHAT GETS ON

00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:24.941
THE SCREEN LATIN WOMEN ARE

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:27.244
GENERALLY NOT PEOPLE IN CHARGE

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.646
WHEN IT COMES TO ABOVE THE LINE.

00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:30.947
SOME OF THE BEARS I'VE SEEN

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:31.982
TIME AND TIME AGAIN ARE THE

00:52:32.048 --> 00:52:34.050
STEREOTYPES THAT DISTORT THE

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:36.186
PERCEPTION OF LATINOS. RARELY

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:37.454
IS A LATINA SEEN AS THE

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:39.189
INTELLECTUAL OR THE LEADER OF

00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:41.691
THE BIG CORPORATION OR THE TYPE

00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:42.359
A PERSON WHO'S IN CHARGE OF

00:52:42.425 --> 00:52:44.327
THINGS. THE STEREOTYPES

00:52:44.394 --> 00:52:45.829
PORTRAYED IN FILM AND

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:47.931
TELEVISION NEEDS CHANGE. WELL

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:49.299
THAT'S CLEARLY NOT THE ONLY

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:51.201
ANSWER TO CHANGING OUR PLACE IN

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:53.537
AMERICA. CHANGE IN WHAT PEOPLE

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:56.172
SEE ON TELEVISION AND IN FILM

00:52:56.239 --> 00:52:58.909
WILL HELP WITH REAL WORLD

00:52:58.975 --> 00:53:00.577
CHANGE. FOR ME PERSONALLY OF

00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:01.678
COURSE THERE ARE THE MICRO

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:03.547
AGGRESSIONS I DEAL WITH DAY TO

00:53:03.613 --> 00:53:06.216
DAY. PEOPLE ASKING ME TO

00:53:06.283 --> 00:53:07.050
TRANSLATE FOR THEIR MEXICAN

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:09.619
NANNY. FOR THEIR GARDENER OR

00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:10.787
COMPLAINING ABOUT THEIR

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:13.290
HOUSEKEEPER OR JOKES ABOUT.

00:53:13.356 --> 00:53:17.394
IMMIGRANTS OR A BEGINNER. BUT

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.895
THERE'S ALSO TIMES WHEN PEOPLE

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:21.097
STEP UP ON A RECENT SET ONE OF

00:53:21.164 --> 00:53:22.098
THE CREW WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT

00:53:22.165 --> 00:53:23.700
THE NOISE FROM THE CONSTRUCTION

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:26.369
SITE NEXT DOOR AND SAID ONE WE

00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:28.305
JUST CALL IMMIGRATION. TELL

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:30.640
SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN THAT

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:32.275
INSTANCE THE DIRECTOR AND

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:34.611
MYSELF WE BOTH SPOKE UP AND

00:53:34.678 --> 00:53:36.713
SHOT THAT COMMENT RIGHT DOWN.

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.348
THE APPROPRIATENESS WAS

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:40.750
ADDRESSED IN THAT MOMENT. WELL

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:42.819
MY YEARS IN INDUSTRY HAVE LED

00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:43.787
ME TO BELIEVE IS THAT THE

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:45.088
PROBLEM OF DIVERSITY IN

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:47.824
HOLLYWOOD IS NOT SIX AND WE

00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:49.159
NEED TO CONTINUALLY PUSH TO GET

00:53:49.225 --> 00:53:51.628
A SEAT AT THE TABLE MY INDUSTRY

00:53:51.695 --> 00:53:54.831
REFLECTS THE LARGER PROBLEM WE

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:56.666
FACE IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY. IN

00:53:56.733 --> 00:53:58.735
FACT WHAT WORRIES ME IS THAT

00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:00.003
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.371
RIGHT NOW IS THAT TOO MANY

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:03.006
PEOPLE ARE SEEING THIS DEBATE

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:04.774
THE NEED FOR CHANGE. IN BLACK

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:07.243
AND WHITE. PEOPLE NEED TO OPEN

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:08.979
THEIR EYES TO WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:10.413
IN THAT THE NUANCED OF

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.449
DIVERSITY IS GETTING LOST. WE

00:54:12.515 --> 00:54:13.683
NEED TO REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.852
COME IN A RAINBOW OF COLORS. WE

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:17.087
NEED TO REMEMBER THAT DIVERSITY

00:54:17.153 --> 00:54:19.022
CAN BE APPLIED TO AGE

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:21.625
DISABILITY GENDER. AND SEXUAL

00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:24.160
PREFERENCE AS WELL. SOMETIMES

00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:25.528
IT'S NOT SO OBVIOUS WHO SOMEONE

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:27.464
IS. AND WHAT I MEAN IS THAT

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:28.965
I'VE HAD PEOPLE WHO ASKED ME TO

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:31.034
HIRE SOMEONE SAY WELL THAT

00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:33.003
PERSON'S NOT DIVERSE ENOUGH OR

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.838
WE WANT A CERTAIN TYPE OF

00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:37.574
PERSON. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:39.643
I ANY IDEA. THAT DIVERSITY

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:41.511
MIGHT BE RIGHT THERE LOOKING AT

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:44.547
THEM IN THE FACE. LATINAS OFTEN

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:45.715
GET HURT BY THIS LIMITED

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:47.584
ATTITUDE OFTEN FROM EXECUTIVE

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:54.424
SUITES I KNOW THIS. SEEN AS

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:56.359
REPRESENTING DIVERSITY AND

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:57.627
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE

00:54:57.694 --> 00:54:59.162
INDIVIDUAL OR FOR THE CHANGE

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:02.132
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. WHAT KIND

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:04.601
OF WORLD VIEW CREATE DISK THAT

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:06.336
KIND OF WORLD VIEW CREATE

00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:07.537
SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:09.572
AFRAID OR ANGRY WITH EACH

00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:11.408
OTHER. THAT WILL GET US WHERE

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:13.476
WE NEED TO GO WE DON'T WANT TO

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:15.245
PIT PEOPLE AGAINST EACH OTHER

00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:17.113
THAT WILL GET US WHERE WE WANT

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.783
TO GO. WE NEED TO RESPECT AND

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:21.951
EMBRACE THE NEW PEOPLE WE MUST

00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:24.454
GET INTO THIS INDUSTRY. BUT WE

00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:26.122
ALSO HAVE TO RESPECT THOSE WHO

00:55:26.189 --> 00:55:28.158
HAVE BEEN HERE. WE SET OUR

00:55:28.224 --> 00:55:30.093
SIGHTS ON INCLUSION BOTH ON THE

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.328
SET BUT ALSO WITH THE PEOPLE

00:55:32.395 --> 00:55:34.497
WHO GREEN LIGHT. WHAT KIND OF

00:55:34.564 --> 00:55:37.567
SHOWS WE SEE AND WHO GETS HIRED.

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:39.135

INDUSTRY WE'RE GOING TO NEED

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.842

FABULOUS AND I'M SURE SOME OF

THE EVERYBODY HAS SOME

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:23.980
QUESTIONS ALL START WITH ONE

AND THEN- WE'LL GO AHEAD AND

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:28.318
ASK. THE OTHER MEMBERS. WHAT

00:56:28.384 --> 00:56:30.320
QUESTIONS OF ANY THEY HAVE- I

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:32.388
WAS STRUCK WHEN- PEOPLE ARE

00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:34.290
TALKING ABOUT THE PROGRAMS

00:56:34.357 --> 00:56:35.458
THEY'VE DEVELOPED TO HELP WITH

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:37.527
DIVERSITY. BUT IN A KIND OF

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:40.029
BROADER SENSE CAN YOU. ADDRESS

00:56:40.096 --> 00:56:41.164
YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:42.832
DIVERSITY PROGRAMS THAT STUDIOS

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:45.101
HAVE. OR ARE THEY WORKING WHY

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:46.436
OR WHY NOT WHAT CAN BE DONE TO

00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:48.138
IMPROVE THEM IT SEEMS IT WAS

00:56:48.204 --> 00:56:51.174
INTERESTING TO ME. THAT THE-

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:52.809
ARE CLEAR TO ME THAT SOME OF

00:56:52.876 --> 00:56:54.377
THE EXAMPLES GIVEN WERE WERE

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:55.745
THINGS THAT YOU ALL DID

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:58.214
YOURSELVES TO HELP LEND A HAND

00:56:58.281 --> 00:57:01.050
OR OR A TO BROUGHT IN- THAT THE

00:57:01.117 --> 00:57:02.685
NETWORK BUT- WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR

00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:05.288
VIEWS IF ANY ON THE DIVERSITY

00:57:05.355 --> 00:57:09.092
PROGRAMS AT THE STUDIOS HAVE.

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:12.362
ANY OF. I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK TO

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:14.030
MY EXPERIENCE I WAS VERY

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:16.065
FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:16.933
PARTICIPATE IN THAT AGENCY

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.268
FELLOWSHIP BUT ALSO TO DO N. B.

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:19.402
C.'S WRITERS ON THE VERGE WHICH

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:22.071
IS A IN STUDIO- STUDIO

00:57:22.138 --> 00:57:24.207
INITIATIVE AT NBC AND I THINK

00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:26.042
THEY'RE FANTASTIC BUT THEIR

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:28.444
NUMBERS OF WHAT THEY'RE GETTING

00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:29.179
YEAH IT'S YOU KNOW THEY'RE

00:57:29.245 --> 00:57:30.880
GETTING TWO THOUSAND THREE

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:31.815
THOUSAND APPLICANTS EACH YEAR

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:33.516
AND GREW THEIR FORTUNATE IF

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:34.784
THEY HAVE ONE LEFT IN- IN THAT

00:57:34.851 --> 00:57:38.254
IN EACH CLASS EACH YEAR. AND

00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:40.990
IT'S- I AM AND I KNOW THAT THEY

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.625
KNOW THAT THE REAL PROBLEM WITH

00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:44.527
THESE INITIATIVES. WITHIN THE

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:45.562
STUDIO SYSTEM IS THAT THERE ARE

00:57:45.628 --> 00:57:47.063
GREAT TO GET YOU IN THE DOOR

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.598
BUT THEN THEY DO NOT HELP YOU

00:57:48.665 --> 00:57:50.233
TO GET THE SECOND JOB. AND

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.467
THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING IN OUR

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:53.937
OF NETWORKING GROUP THAT 30% OF

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:55.939
OUR MEMBERS ARE OUR- STAFF

00:57:56.005 --> 00:57:57.440
WRITER LEVEL. IT'S BECAUSE THEY

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:58.608
CAN'T GET HIRED AS STORY

00:57:58.675 --> 00:57:59.742
EDITORS WHICH IS THE SECOND

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.845
TIER UP. WHICH IS LITERALLY

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:03.746
DOUBLE THE PAY SO IF THEY CAN

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:06.049
COME FOR FREE OR CHEAP THEIR

00:58:06.115 --> 00:58:07.116
STUDIO SYSTEM THEN THEY'RE

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:08.952
GETTING WORK BUT THEN WHEN. IT

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:11.487
REQUIRES ACCOUNTABILITY TO YOU

00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:13.122
KNOW COME OUT OF A TRUE BUDGET.

00:58:13.189 --> 00:58:15.258

FORTH IT'S HAPPENING BUT THAT'S

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:07.569
THAT'S A VERY MUCH BECAUSE OF

LATINOS AND I FOUND THAT TO BE

01:45:21.181 --> 01:45:23.216
REALLY FASCINATING AND THAT-

01:45:23.283 --> 01:45:25.318

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WITHIN

01:47:03.617 --> 01:47:05.685

AMERICAN ACTOR WHO CAME OUT HE

01:48:25.398 --> 01:48:26.032

THAT. ONE POWERFUL VOICE THAT'S

01:48:43.483 --> 01:48:45.051
ACTUALLY IN THE INDUSTRY THAT'S

THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO PAY

FOR IT BECAUSE THE PHONE

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:54.794

01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:56.830
DON'T HAVE THAT REPRESENTATIVE

01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:58.164
I WANT TO HEAR FROM EVERYBODY

01:48:58.231 --> 01:49:00.667
