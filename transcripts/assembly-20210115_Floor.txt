AGAIN TODAY IS TO HONOR THE A BIRTHDAY THE NINETY SECOND BIRTHDAY OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING AND RECOGNIZE THIS IMPORTANT HOLIDAY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA IS OF COURSE THE FIRST STATE TO RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF DR KING. AND AS WE REFLECT ABOUT DR KING AT TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH I THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE CUT WE HAVE COME BUT ALSO HOW FAR WE NEED TO GO. LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THE LAST THE LAST THE LAST WEEK AS WE REMEMBER DR KING AND THINK ABOUT. THE HOLIDAY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. REMEMBRANCE AND SERVICE HOPEFULLY NEXT WEEK DURING THE DURING THE DAY OFTEN MANY OF US ARE TAKING THE DAY OFF IT'S REALLY ABOUT REFLECTION. BUT AGAIN LET'S THINK ABOUT HIS LEGACY THE PAST. TEN DAYS. WE ARE AMAZED LAST TUESDAY NIGHT. WHEN WE SAW THE AMAZING ELECTORAL VICTORY. A REFERENDUM RAPHAELWARNOCK THE POT THE PASTOR OF DR KING'S EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH. HE BECAME GEORGIA'S FIRST BLACK SENATOR. TRULY AMAZING IN THE DEEP SOUTH. AND REMARKABLE SHOWING US HOW FAR WE HAVE COME. DR KING WOULD SURELY BE BEAMING FROM PRIDE. AS DR WARNOCK NOTED. HIS MOM USED TO PICK COTTON. AND THAT DAY TEN DAYS AGO HIS MOM WAS ABLE TO PICK WHO WOULD BECOME THE U. S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA. BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THE VERY NEXT DAY. WHEN A MOB OF RIDERS FILLED WITH HATE. AND WHITE SUPREMACY. STORMED OUR NATION'S CAPITAL. THAT WAS NOT NINETEEN SIXTY ONE. THAT WAS TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WITH THAT SINK IN FOR A MOMENT AS WE THINK ABOUT DR KING IN THE HOLIDAY. WE SAW OVER TWO DAYS THE BEST OF US. AND THE WORST OF US. IT'S A CLEAR REMINDER THAT DR KING'S WORK IS NOT DONE. WE KNOW THIS AND WE KNOW AS WE CELEBRATE AND HONOR THIS NATIONAL HOLIDAY WE LOOK ABOUT THE MOMENTS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BEEN REINVIGORATED THE MOVEMENT OF DR KING IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. A MOMENT OF RACIAL JUSTICE ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY DOT CALIFORNIANS RISE UP AFTER THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD WITH AN INDOMITABLE QUEST TO CONTINUE DR KING'S WORK. THIS PAST YEAR WE TOOK A LONG LOOK INWARD AND CONTINUE TO LOOK AT OURSELVES ASKING OURSELVES KEY QUESTIONS. HAVE WEDONE ENOUGH TO HONOR DR KING'S WORK WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO. WE KNOW THIS THE WEEK THAT WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO WE KNOW THE ARC OF JUSTICE DENSE. WE KNOW WE CAN EITHER HELP OR HINDER. CERTAINLY WE'RE PROUD THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO RISE UP AND HONOR DR KING'S LEGACY WITH OUR WORK JUST IN THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'VE ENACTED MAJOR POLICE REFORM MEASURES RESTORED VOTING RIGHTS. DOWN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE AND LAUNCHED WEEK IN THE WEEKS TO COME WE MUST TO KEEP CONTINUE TO GET OUT OF THE WORK OF MAKING AN HONORING DR KING'S LEGACY WITH ACTION VOTES AND MAKING TOUGH CHOICES. WE MUST REMEMBER THE REASON WHY WE HONOR AND CELEBRATE DR KING HIS SPIRIT IN LIFE CREATE A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. EMOTE A MOVEMENT AND M. AND MOMENTS TO TRANSFORM THE LIVES OF AFRICAN AMERICANS BUT CLEARLY WERE NOT DONE. LET'S REFLECT ON THE WORDS OF DR KING AS WE EMBARK ON OUR WORK IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I REMEMBER THE TIME IS ALWAYS RIGHT. TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT HAVE A C. R. EIGHT. AND MADAM SPEAKER ANNOUNCED THE FIRST ROLE BE OPEN TO CO AUTHORS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY MISREAD MENU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. IT'S WITH GREAT PRIDE THAT I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS. IN SUPPORT OF A C. R. EIGHT AND TO CELEBRATE THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. THE JEWISH CAUCUS IS HUMBLED TO STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF SUCH A GIANT AS DR KING. WHOSE TEACHINGS AND WORDS CONTINUE TO PIERCE THROUGH THE DARKEST OF TIMES FOR ALL MARGINALIZED MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC. LAST YEAR MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THE SPECIAL PLACE THAT IS FOREVER CARVED OUT IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF AMERICAN JEWS FOR DR KING. I WOULD LIKE TO PAY FOR YOU TODAY. THE IMAGE OF ONE THOUSAND RABBIS DURING A CELEBRATION THAT THE REVEREND MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR ATTENDED IN CELEBRATION. OF BELOVED RABBI ABRAHAM. JOSHUA HERSHEL IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. IN HEBREW AND IN SOLIDARITY THEY SANG WE SHALL OVERCOME. AND COLLEAGUES I CANNOT THINK OF A MORE TIMELY SONG TITLE FOR OUR NATION. WE SHALL OVERCOME THESE TRYING TIMES BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF LEARNING HOW TO RESPECT AND HOW TO LOVE EACH OTHER FROM DR KING. HIS POWERFUL MENTION MET MENTIONED MESSAGE OF EQUALITY AND JUSTICE ARE ALSO THE CORNERSTONES OF MY JEWISH FAITH IN OUR TRADITION. IN FACT THE CONCEPT OF TWO CAME ALONG. WHICH MEANS TO HEAL THE WORLD IS EMBODIED BY ALL OF DR KING'S ACTIONS AND BY HIS LEGACY. AND ON THIS DAY THAT WE REMEMBER DR KING I'D BE REMISS IF I DID NOT MENTION THE POWER OF HOPE. THAT HE HAS PROVIDED FOR ALL GENERATIONS THAT HAVE FOLLOWED HIM. WE MUST ACCEPT FINITE DISAPPOINTMENT BUT NEVER LOSE INFINITE HOPE THOSE WERE HIS WORDS AND AS WE ENTER A NEW YEAR. I IMPLORE ALL OF US TO NEVER LOSE INFINITE HOPE. SO THAT WE MAY CONTINUE TO HONOR ADVANCE THE BETTER TOMORROW. THAT DR KING HAD HOPED FOR ALL OF US. THIS WEEKEND LET US REMEMBER DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR'S VISION OF LOVE. ZERO AND BELIEF IN FREEDOM AND JUSTICE AND HIS HOPE FOR A BETTER TOMORROW. HE WAS AS WE SAY. A REAL MENSCH IN THAT SPIRIT I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR A C. R. EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS FRIEDMAN MYSTERY OF US YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. I ALSO RISE TODAY TO HONOR THE LEGACY OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX WITH DR KING WROTE A LETTER TO SETTLE CHAVEZ WHO HAD RECENTLY MARCH FROM DELANO TO SACRAMENTO IT WAS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILE WALK. HE HAD MARCHED TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE MISTREATMENT OF FARM WORKERS. IN HIS LETTER IT WAS DR KING STATED AS BROTHERS IN THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. I STILL HAD A FELLOWSHIP AND GOOD WILL IN WHICH THE CONTINUING SUCCESS TO YOU AND YOUR MEMBERS. OUR SEPARATE STRUGGLES ARE REALLY ONE. A STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM FOR DIGNITY FOR HUMANITY. THE DOCTOR KING SO CLEARLY THAT NO ONE CAN BE FREE UNLESS WE ALL ARE FREE. BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE JUSTICE UNLESS WE ALL HAVE JUSTICE. OVER THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE SEEN A PANDEMIC THAT HAS DEVASTATED OUR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. MANY OF THEM BROWN AND BLACK. WE HAVE SEEN A MOVEMENT FOR RACIAL JUSTICE. FOR EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW. AND NOW WE ARE THREATENED. BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS BY CONSPIRACY THEORISTS. WHO REJECT OUR DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS. TRADITIONS OF NONVIOLENT PROTEST. A PEACEFUL TRANSFERS OF POWER. OF REASONED DEBATE. THE DEBATE BASED ON FACTS AND FREE OF VIOLENCE. THESE ARE THE TRADITIONS THAT ALLOW US TO EXIST TOGETHER AS A NATION. THAT ALLOW US TO MOVE SLOWLY AND IN PERFECTLY. TOWARDS LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. IN HIS LETTER FROM A BIRMINGHAM JAIL DOCTOR KING SAID IT AGAIN. WE ARE CAUGHT IN AN INESCAPABLE NETWORK TIED TO A SINGLE GARMENT OF DESTINY. I'M SO PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE MY COLLEAGUES IN THE BLACK CAUCUS. I'M PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. AND IN MY CAPACITY AS VICE CHAIR AS A MEMBER OF THE LATINO CAUCUS. I RECOMMIT TODAY. TO HONOR THE VALUES OF DR KING. TO WORK FOR JUSTICE. TO EXTENDED A HAND OF FELLOWSHIP AND GOOD WILL. AND TO RECOGNIZE AS DR KING WROTE THAT OUR SEPARATE STRUGGLES ARE REALLY ONE. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER. THANK YOU MR THIS MISTER Q. ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I WRITE IN SUPPORT OF A C. R. E. DR KING'S LEGACY IS ROOTED IN THE FIGHT OF THE QUALITY AND THE FIGHT AGAINST INJUSTICE FOR NONVIOLENCE. HONORING HIS MEMORY WITH THIS RESOLUTION DURING A TIME OF SUCH CIVIL UNREST IT'S RAINING. IF DR KING WERE HERE TODAY TO WITNESS THE STATE OF AMERICA TODAY I IMAGINE HE WOULD NOTE THAT WHILE THE FLAMES OF DIVISION ARE BURNING HOT RIGHT NOW. THEY BURN FROM THE FUEL OF PROGRESS. THE VIOLENCE WE WITNESS AGAINST OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AGAINST DEMOCRACY ARE THE CRY OF A DYING INEQUITY. ALL OF THE VIOLENCE IN REGIONS LIKE THE SHOOTING OF A CONDITION THAT OUR SOCIETY CAN NO LONGER BEAR. DR KING WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO SEEK JUSTICE AND PEACE. THROUGH NONVIOLENCE EDUCATION AND THROUGH THE POWER OF OUR FEARS AS WEAPONS THE BALANCE. THESE LAST YEARS HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE MOST DIVISIVE TIMES IN HISTORY. WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE WORST IN OUR SOCIETY BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF HATE AND FEAR AND ANGER AND IGNORANCE TO FLOW FULLY THAT FREELY AMONG US. AS WITH DIVISION WIND. DR KING KNEW. THAT WE NEEDED LOVE AND WISDOM AND COMPASSION TOWARD ONE ANOTHER. AND A FEELING OF JUSTICE TOWARD THOSE WHO STILL SUFFER WITHIN OUR COUNTRY. AND IF PAINFUL AS IT MAY BE FOR SOME OF US DID NOT THAT THAT TENANT. WHEN IT IS SO EASY TO SPEAK ILL OF SOMEONE WHO ANGERS US OR IGNORE THE OPINIONS OF THOSE WE DISAGREE WITH BECAUSE IT'S EASY. WE ALL KNOW IN OUR HEART IT'S RIGHT. LOVE WISDOM COMPASSION JUSTICE SIMPLE WORDS TO UNDERSTAND BUT DIFFICULT TO PUT INTO PRACTICE. I LEARNED MANY OF THESE LESSONS IN CHURCH AND SCHOOL DEALING WITH FRIENDS AND BEING WITH FAMILY MY PARENTS WORK TO INSTILL THESE VALUES IN ME AND I STRIVE TO DO THE SAME FOR MY DAUGHTER. EVERY DAY. MY MOM SHOWED ME HOW TO LEAD AND WORK FOR THE COMMUNITY AND DOING SO. SHE WORKED TO BRING ABOUT EQUALITY AND A POSITIVE CHANGE. AND I LEARNED THAT'S HOW WE SHOW OUR LOVE AND OUR COMPASSION FOR OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS. I BELIEVE IN THAT MISSION SO MUCH THAT I FOLLOWED IN HER FOOTSTEPS AND I STAND BEFORE YOU AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. JUST AS SHE WANTS TO. AN I. BEAM WITH PRIDE AND HONOR AT THIS DISTINCTION. THAT WE SHARE IN THIS CHAMBER. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. I LOOK AT YOU ALL AND I DON'T SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME. WE KNOW THE PHRASE REPRESENTATION MATTERS AND I BELIEVE IN IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY. I THINK CARLA HARRIS A BI RACIAL CALIFORNIAN NATIVE WHO LOOKS LIKE ME REACH THE WHITE HOUSE'S VICE PRESIDENT IN NINE STATES BEFORE YOU EVER BE ETCHED IN MY MEMORY. I WATCHED HER ASCENT TO HEIGHTS PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN BY WOMEN OF COLOR. I PRAY ISABELLA MY DAUGHTER GOES TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AND IT'S NOT AN EXCEPTION. I AM HUMBLED BY DR KING'S LEGACY AND HIS VISION FOR OUR NATION. BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEING IN THIS CHAMBER WHERE WE DO THE PEOPLE'S WORK. IS A STARK REMINDER THAT WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO. WE TALK ABOUT INCLUSION AND EQUITY. AND EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AND ONE WAY TO FULFILL THOSE GOALS IS TO UPLIFT WOMEN. PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THOSE IN MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT REPRESENTATION HERE. INSTEAD I'M FACED WITH DWINDLING NUMBERS. AS SADLY SOON I WILL BE ONE OF THE FEW BLACK WOMEN IN THIS ASSEMBLY. BUT I'M NOT DETERRED AND I BELIEVE DR KING'S DREAM DOES CONTINUE. AS WE HONOR HIS MEMORY TODAY LET'S FIND WAYS TO MAKE THIS BUILDING OUR STATE OUR NATION ONE OF EQUITY AND JUSTICE FOR EVERYONE. AND LET US REMEMBER. WE NOW AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BETTER TO GET. THANK YOU MISS BURKE. MR WELL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES SAID ARISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LGBTQ PLUS CAUCUS AS WELL AS THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS A WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES WHO.

SIMILARLY WE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE HOLIDAY. WHY SHOULD WE TAKE TIME OFF. TO RECOGNIZE AN OKAY DAY. TO REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT AND TO REMEMBER. THE STRUGGLES IN THE DARK HISTORY BUT TO CREATE A PATH FORWARD FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO COME. TO BE REMINDED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT HIS LEGACY MEANT FOR ALL OF US NOT JUST IN TERMS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE BUT ALSO IN CIVIL RIGHTS. AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AND OKAY ALSO. ADVOCATED FOR THE ABOLITION. A POVERTY PERMISSION TO READ BENEFITS WITHOUT OBJECTION AND ADVOCATING FOR BASIC MINIMUM GUARANTEE WHAT WE WOULD THINK TO TODAY AS AN UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO CIVILIZE OURSELVES BY THE TOTAL DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE ABOLITION OF POVERTY. AND SO WE SEE SIMILAR ITERATIONS OF A MINIMUM GUARANTEED INCOME. AND SO AGAIN WE STAND IN SUPPORT OF RECOGNIZING. THE LEGACY AND THE CONTINUATION. OF THE WORK THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE THANK YOU.

REQUESTED THAT WE TAKE EARLY ACTION ON A NUMBER OF ITEMS IN THE HOUSE. THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ARE IN DISCUSSION ON WHICH ITEMS TO TAKE.

THESE AREN'T EVEN BILLS. THESE ARE JUST NUMBERS WITH A SINGLE SENTENCE. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ENACT STATUTORY CHANGES RELATING TO THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ARE BEGINNING TO CRAFT THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF PUBLIC POLICY WE WORK ON EACH YEAR. AND WE ARE ALREADY REVERTING TO THE UNFORTUNATE COMMON PRACTICE OF THROWING EMPTY BILLS INTO THE FRAY. FAILING TO PROVIDE REAL BUDGET TRANSPARENCY. YES BUT THIS BODY ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE. HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD CALIFORNIA OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. YET THESE EMPTY VESSELS AND DO NOTHING TO PUT US ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. WE HAVE WORKING PARENTS WHO ARE DESPERATELY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. STUDENTS WHO WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY. HOSPITALS THAT ARE BEING CRUSHED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND STAFF. SMALL BUSINESSES TRYING TO SURVIVE AND GET THEIR EMPLOYEES BACK TO WORK. MAY ON MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS STOCK IN THE BROKEN BUREAUCRACY OF THE ET DE. FOREST MANAGEMENT PROJECTS THAT NEED TO BE PRIORITIZED PREVENT POWER SHUT OFFS. AND DEVASTATING WILDFIRES AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. THESE PRESSING ISSUES AND MORE MUST BE ADDRESSED IN THIS BUDGET. BUT THE URGENCY WITH WHICH WE MUST PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IS NO EXCUSE TO CIRCUMVENT PROPER PROCESS. AND UNDERMINE THE TRANSPARENCY WE SHOULD PROVIDE. THIS YEAR. THE BUDGET MEANS MORE THAN EVER AND WE REVEAL OUR PRIORITIES TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. WITH THE CREATION OF THIS BUDGET BUT TODAY. ALL WE HAVE TO SHOW OR ANTI BILLS. WE SHOULD BE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE STRUGGLING FAMILIES SOMETHING TANGIBLE. BILLS OF SUBSTANCE WITH THE REAL MEANS OF RELIEF BEFORE WE CAST THE VOTE. OF COURSE IT WILL BE SAID THAT THIS IS THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN DONE. BUT I WOULD CHALLENGE US TO QUESTION THIS REASONING. THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES AND REQUIRES US TO REFLECT ON HOW WE SHOULD SERVE THIS GREAT STATE. ARISING OUT OF A PANDEMIC. AND A RECESSION WE SHOULD STRIVE TO CONNECT WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS AND PROVIDE THROUGH. HONEST TRANSPARENCY AS YOU PASS THIS BUDGET. THESE CHALLENGING TIMES SHOULD LEAD ALL OF US TO FIND A BETTER BUDGETING SYSTEM. WE NEED A PROCESS THAT ENCOURAGES PUBLIC INPUT STRENGTHENS THE INTEGRITY TO THE LEGISLATURE AND MAXIMIZE ITS TRANSPARENCY AND THAT'S WHY I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE NO ON THESE AND THESE ARE THE BILLS TODAY. THANK YOU MR FUNG WEST. THIRD TEAM HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE KING WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THINK ABOUT SPEAKER JUST TO REITERATE TO CALL- EVERY THROUGHOUT OUR BUDGET PROCESS WE END UP HAVING. HUNDREDS OF HEARINGS THIS YEAR WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A FEW LESS JUST BECAUSE OF. BUILDING CONSTRAINTS BECAUSE OF BUILDING CONSTRAINTS OF ROOM CONSTRAINTS. WE HAVE AN EXHAUSTIVE PROCESS THERE IS NO COMMITTEE THAT DEBATES OR DISCUSSIONS EVERY SINGLE ITEM. MORE THAN OUR COMMITTEE I VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING ROBUST DISCUSSION. TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE BUDGET AS WELL AS WELL WE WOULD BE. FINALIZING THE BUDGET BUT IN THE END WE HAVE FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE DESPERATE FOR ACTION. IN SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE TAKING THIS EARLY ACTION TO LOOK OUT FOR THE MEDIATE. WITH THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE. WORKING ON SCHOOLS WHETHER IT'S WORKING TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. WEATHER IS TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS GET MONEY THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED- THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA NEED ACTION AND WE'RE HERE TO TAKE THANK YOU FOR SUBSCRIBING. THANK YOU MR KING.
