THIRTY NINE THIRTY WE REPRESENT OVER A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND HOME CARE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE WHO PROVIDE CARE. FOR SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES MOST VULNERABLE THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I AM THE MOTHER OF MANNY -- SO I AM. ASKING FOR YOUR ALL'S I VOTE FOR A. B. NINE ONE ONE THE MANNY ALERT ACT -- AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THE REASON WHY SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS SO VERY IMPORTANT AND VITAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES -- AS THE MOTHER OF MANY HERE IS A TWENTY YEAR OLD ADULT ARTISTIC -- HE IS VERY MUCH MORE LIKE CHILD LIKE LIKE THAT THAT OF A TWO YEAR OLD. BUT HE IS NON VERBAL HERE'S COMBATIVE HE'S A RUNNER. HE IS ALSO ATHLETIC. AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT I FEEL FOR FIRST RESPONDERS TO KNOW IN ADVANCE AND TO HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE ABLE TO MORE. ADEQUATELY INTERACT WITH MY SON -- ALSO IN THE IT FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO HAS ALZHEIMERS OR DEMENTIA AND THEY SPEAK SPANISH OR THEY HAVE PTSD OR WHATEVER THE CASE IS -- YOU WANT THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO NOW YOU WANT THEM TO BE WELL EQUIPPED SO THAT THEY CAN DO THEIR JOBS EFFECTIVELY -- AND AT THE END OF THE DAY EVERYBODY GETS TO CALL HOME. SO IN MY TRAVELS THROUGHOUT THE LAST YEAR I HAVE FOUND SEVERAL MUNICIPALITIES ACROSS THE STATE FROM SAN DIEGO TO SANTA CLARITA LA COUNTY HAS ISSUED A BE ON THE BRING OUR LOVED ONES HOME -- ELK GROVE AND KERN COUNTY HAVE A SMART I WON ONE TYPE SYSTEM. THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR INFORMATION TO IN ADVANCE AND FOR FIRST RESPONDERS HOWEVER WE NEED SOMETHING THAT IS COHESIVE ACROSS THE STATE. SO THAT IF I GIVE MY AND MY SON'S INFORMATION OR EVEN MY OWN INFORMATION MODESTO CALIFORNIA BUT I TAKEN TO DISNEYLAND AND HE GOES MISSING. THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE I'M GOING BE FRANTIC AND I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING AND THEY'LL HAVE A PITCHER AND IT WILL BE IN REAL TIME. AND IT WON'T BE LAGGED -- AND AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. THAT WE THAT WE TAKE THE STEPS INTO IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO AT THE END OF THE DAY EVERYBODY GETS HOME SAFELY TO THEIR LOVED ONES AND WE LESSEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF ANY. L. THINGS HAPPENING. I THINK YOU AND I URGE FOR YOUR AYE VOTE VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND THE FIRE DISASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. YOU. STEVEN WEBER OF CALIFORNIA ASKS ME IN SUPPORT. A WITNESSES OPPOSITION SEEING NONE A QUESTIONS. COMMENTS CENTER ON JULY OR DETAILS SEVEN RUBIO DID YOU. KNOW THAT YES I DO HAVE A QUESTION WELL FIRST OF ALL. A PLUS FOR CREATIVITY AB NINE ONE ONE WHAT A GREAT WAY TO TO REMEMBER THIS BILL RIGHT -- BUT YOU KNOW I DO SEE THE IMPORTANCE I JUST SAT WANT TO DO. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT BUT A TUMMY THAT IT TALKS ABOUT A TIME LINE AND HITTING A TARGET WHAT IT IS THAT TIME NINETY LOOK LIKE FOR YOU. TO BE THE NEXT FOUR YEARS OF STRUCTURAL OF OUR NEXT GENERATION ON NINE ONE ONE THIS WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL COMPONENT. BUT REMEMBER THIS IS GONNA BE A VOLUNTARY SYSTEM THAT YOU JUST MORE INFORMATION LIKE I TALKED ABOUT TO GIVE OUR FOR FISH FINDERS PART ARRIVING ON SCENE TO BETTER. ESTABLISH THE TYPE OF PERSON THEY'RE COMING ACROSS BECAUSE OF THE DISABILITIES OUR HISTORY THAT THEY HAVE SET THE TIMER WORK WE CAL -- YES AS WELL TO HELP BETTER SYSTEM I GET THE SYSTEM GOING TO IMPLEMENT WITH THE NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ON IT JUST SEEMS LIKE -- AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE SHOW UP TO A HOUSEHOLD AND NOT KNOW WHAT. THEY'RE DEALING WITH AND TELL YOU CAN SAVE A COUPLE OF LIFE THAT WE THINK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT MEMBER CENTER ARCHULETA YES THANK YOU -- THE BRIDGE BILL AND I'M EAGER TO SUPPORT IT JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- BACK IN THE DAY WHEN EVERYONE HAD A PHONE AT HOME I COULD SEE THE NINE ONE ONE CALL COMING IN A BECAUSE I WORK FOR POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND SO WHEN THE NINE ONE ONE CALLS WITH COMMAND IT WOULD GIVE THE ADDRESS AND SO ON SO NOW OF I'M ASSUMING IN THE FUTURE IT WOULD ALSO PRINT OUT FOR THE DISPATCHER. SOME OF THE DISABILITY TO WHAT TO EXPECT -- BUT AS YOU HAD MENTIONED YOU YOU HAVE TO CALL IT IN. SO ARE WE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE CALLING NINE ONE ONE TO SAY BY THE WAY I HAVE A CHILD EACH HAS A PROBLEM RIGHT BUT AN ADULT TO THIS OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE A DISABILITY. DOES THAT NOT TIE UP IN NINE ONE ONE CALL OR DO THEY CALL THE THE STATION ITSELF HOW DO WE GET THAT ON THE SCREEN. SO FOR INSTANCE I'LL -- THE SMART I WON ONE OUTGROWTH IN KERN COUNTY IS I'VE ACTUALLY TOWARD THE FACILITIES AND I'VE SEEN HOW IT WORKS. THERE'S A NINE ONE ONE CALL THAT PLACE FROM YOURS MULTIPLE CELLPHONES THAT ONCE YOU'VE CREATED THAT PROFILE IT AUTOMATICALLY POPS UP ON THE DISPATCHERS SCREEN. WHICH THEN THE DISPATCHERS ABLE TO SEND THAT INFORMATION OUT TO WHICHEVER FIRST RESPONDERS ARE -- ARE RESPONDING TO THE CALL AND THEN -- THAT SCREEN IS ONLY OPEN FOR THIRTY MINUTES -- UNLESS THERE'S A REQUEST TO KEEP IT OPEN LONGER AND THEN THAT SCREEN DISAPPEARS. BUT THAT THAT'S KIND OF HOW IT COMES IN THAT PERSON'S INFORMATION PHOTO ALL OF THAT COMES IMMEDIATELY ON TO THE SCREEN FOR THE DISPATCHER AND THEN THEY'RE ABLE TO COMBAT OUT IN IN THAT KIND OF SYSTEM IF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS TO GO WITH THAT KIND OF SYSTEM. THAT'S HOW THAT WOULD WORK GOOD BUT MIKE MY FOR THE QUESTION IS WHEN YOU CALL WHO DO YOU CALL YOU CALL YOUR LOCAL POLICE STATION. DO YOU DIAL 911-2 GIVEN THE INFORMATION IT'S WHEN YOU MAKE A NINE ONE ONE CALL. AND IT GOES TO MAKE THE NINE ONE ONE CALL TO GIVE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU -- CREATE THE PROFILE IN ADVANCE SO IT'S A PROACTIVE VOLUNTARY -- YOU GO OUT AND YOU CREATE YOUR PROFILE IN ADVANCE INTO THE SNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WHAT NUMBER DID YOU DIAL TO GET. THIS GIVES ME THE DETAILS ARE GONNA BE DEVELOPED BY THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES OUT OF ALL THOSE DETAILS THERE. GOT IT GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED CAROL YES IN THAT ARE TRIGGERED ON TO THE LOCAL LEVEL YEAH. BUT AT THE END THE INFORMATION IS THERE WE'RE SAVING A LIFE WE'RE PREVENTING AN INJURY AND WE'RE RESPONDING QUICKLY. WITH THE PROPER MEDICAL TEAM -- OR SECURITY WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. I THINK IT'S GREAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY CENTER NIELSEN. ASSEMBLYMAN RODRIGUEZ MY RELUCTANCE TODAY TO SUPPORT THIS IS BORN OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN WE'VE DEALT WITH THE NINE ONE ONE LEGISLATION. AND WE DID NOT PASSED LAST YEAR BUT IT JUST HAS THIS YEAR.

TWENTY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS HI THIS BILL IMPLEMENTS CHANGES TO THE D. B. B. E. PROGRAM IN RESPONSE THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT. WHICH FOUND AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENTS FAILED TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND RECORD KEEPING PROTOCOLS ON CONTRACTS INVOLVING DVB EASE. AB IN EIGHTEEN OH NINE ADDRESSES THREE CORE ISSUES RAISED IN THE AUDIENCE FIRST IT INCREASES THE NUMBER D. B. B. EASE PARTICIPATING IN THE STATE CONTRACTING.

IS AS PART OF THE PROGRAM AND WE HAVE TO BE HEADQUARTERED HERE STAFF COMES FROM HERE -- THIS BILL ALLOWS US TO COMPETE -- MORE EFFECTIVELY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS A SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE DILUTES THE CENTERS TO THE BIG GUYS OF THE WORLD. I THAT WHEN MOST OF THE CONTRACTS -- MOVING THIS CONTRACTOR VALUE FROM TO A FIFTY THOUSAND TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WILL ALLOW US TO COMPETE FOR MORE PRIME CONTRACTS -- THE WAY THE STATE BUNDLES THEM TOGETHER NOW THEY DON'T WANT TO AWARD A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT A COMPANY WHO'S DONE TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. BUT IF THEY BROKE THAT CONTRACT UP INTO TEN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CONTRACTS NOW WE CAN COMPETE IN THE STATE CAN ALSO WORE THOSE MORE EFFECTIVELY IT'S A VERY LONG AND ARDUOUS PROCESS TO REVIEW. THE TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT RESPONSES TO OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS PROJECT THIS HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAGES OF OF RESPONSE. AND SO THIS ALLOWS THE STATE TO DO MORE EFFECTIVE BUSINESS AND ALLOWS OUR BUSINESSES -- TO COMPETE. WE HAVE MORE THAN LESS THAN 40% OF THE VISA COMPETE AT A PRIME LEVEL TODAY -- BECAUSE THESE RESTRICTIONS WE WE CAN'T MEET THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND AND THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW US TO DO THAT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE A NEW A. B. C. LICENSE FOR THE UNIQUE SAINT JOSEPH'S CHURCH IN MY DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO. FIRST CONSTRUCTED IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN THE SAINT JOSEPH'S CHURCH WAS DESIGNATED A NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK AS WELL AS A SAN FRANCISCO LANDMARK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY UNFORTUNATELY NINE YEARS LATER AFTER SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN THE EIGHTY NINE LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE THE STRUCTURE WAS CLOSED. THE CHURCH REOPENED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS A HOME FOR THE SAINT JOSEPH'S PART SOCIETY. A CULTURAL NONPROFIT INSTITUTION DEDICATED TO CELEBRATING THE ARTS DESIGN FOOD FASHION LITERATURE AND PERFORMANCE. THROUGH ITS FOUNDATION THE CHURCH IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND AVAILABLE TO ARTISTS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO A. B. C. LICENSE THAT EXIST THAT WOULD PERMIT THE CHURCH TO HOLD THE EVENTS THAT THEY'VE ENVISION. ANY EVENT WHERE I'LL CALL SERVE REPORT CHOIR A PARTNERSHIP WITH ANOTHER EXISTING A. B. C. LICENSEE. THE PROCESS TO COMPLETE SUCH PARTNERSHIPS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IS ARDUOUS AND COMPLEX AND A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF LICENSE EVENTS SIGNIFICANTLY CONSTRAINS THE FOUNDATIONS ABILITY. TO SUPPORT ITS MISSION THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A NEW A. B. C. LICENSE TO PROVIDE THE SALE OF ALCOHOL DURING THE ARTISTIC AND CULTURAL EVENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE SAINT JOSEPH'S CHURCH. TRULY BECOMES AN ASSET FOR CALIFORNIA AND SAN FRANCISCO ARTISTS AND COMMUNITY TO COME TOGETHER WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO CALTRANS MOVABLE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M -- PLEASE TODAY 2% -- A. B. FIFTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD CODIFY THE CALIFORNIA STATE NONPROFIT SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM AND PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED ASSISTANCE TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AT RISK OF HATE MOTIVATED VIOLENCE. THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN HATE MOTIVATED VIOLENCE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HATE GROUPS HAVE MADE IMPROVING SECURITY AT INSTITUTIONS SERVING FORMAL COMMUNITIES IN URGENT PRIORITY. THE DEVASTATING SHOOTING AT THE WHOLE BODY PO WAY THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MASSACRED THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE IN PITTSBURGH AND THE HORRIFIC SHOOTING AT A MOSQUE IN NEW ZEALAND. ARE SOME OF THE LATEST EXAMPLES OF HATE MOTIVATED VIOLENCE. THE TO THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE EXTREMISM MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AFRICAN AMERICANS AND JEWS WERE THE MOST FREQUENT TARGETS OF HATE MOTIVATED VIOLENCE. THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THIS REST BY CODIFYING IN STRENGTHENING THE CALIFORNIA STATE NONPROFIT SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED BY THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. GRANT FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF SECURITY MEASURES INCLUDED TARGET HARDENING AND OTHER PHYSICAL SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS SECURITY PERSONNEL AND SECURITY TRAINING THAT WILL HELP PREVENT AND MITIGATE POTENTIAL ACTS OF HATE MOTIVATED VIOLENCE. MANY NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING HOUSES OF WORSHIP AND COMMUNITY CENTERS OPERATE ON EXTREMELY TIGHT BUDGETS AND ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR SUCH SECURITY MEASURES. THIS BILL WILL BE A BIG STEP FOR TO PROTECTING COMMUNITIES TARGETED BY HATE IT HAS NO OPPOSITION AND PASSED THE pBIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

THIS HATE FUELED INCIDENT AND TOO MANY OTHERS LIKE IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE LED TO AN URGENT NEED TO IMPROVE SECURITY AT RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. THIS BILL WILL CREATE THE CALIFORNIA STATE NONPROFIT SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM PROVIDING GRANTS TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AT A HIGH RISK OF VIOLENT ATTACKS OR HATE CRIMES. IN ORDER TO BETTER ENABLE THEM TO EVALUATE AND UPGRADE THEIR SECURITY AND SAFETY I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL -- AND GOVERNOR NEW SOME FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON HIS ISSUE -- AS WELL AS THE WITNESSES WE HAVE HERE TO TO HELP WITH THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER TASK WITNESSES SUPPORT [inaudible] YES.
