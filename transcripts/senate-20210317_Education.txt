GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD MORNING. OKAY IT'S A GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY I'M PROUD TO PRESENT SB SEVENTY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IS PART OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION BILL PACKAGE THAT MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED EARLIER THIS YEAR THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT CHILDREN RECEIVE CRITICAL INSTRUCTION THE EARLIEST YEARS OF LEARNING SPECIFICALLY SB SEVENTY WILL REQUIRE STUDENTS TO COMPLETE ONE YEAR OF KINDERGARTEN BEFORE ENTERING THE FIRST GRADE. AS AN EDUCATOR FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS I HAVE PERSONALLY WITNESS HOWARD EDUCATION CAN BE SUCH A POSITIVE IMPACT ON STUDENTS ACADEMIC SAYS FIX US UP ALSO SEE HOW DETRIMENTAL IT COULD BE TWO CHILDREN THAT HAVEN'T ATTENDED SCHOOL. YOU CAN INSTANTLY DISTINGUISHED SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT DID BENEFIT FROM IT. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE AS A TEACHER I'VE WITNESSED A CHILD SITTING IN A CLASSROOM. HOLDING A PENCIL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH IT HOLDING A BOOK UPSIDE DOWN PLAYING WITH EVERYTHING IN SIGHT. AND BEING SOMEONE FOCUS BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER BEEN IN A SCHOOL SETTING. ON THE CONTRARY WE HAVE STUDENTS SITTING NEXT TO THEM THAT. ARE READING AT A SECOND GRADE LEVEL WRITING FULL SENTENCES. READY FOCUS BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT EXPERIENCE. AND THE DISPARITIES THAT WE WITNESS IN OUR STUDENTS THEY'RE NOT ONLY ACADEMIC IMMEASURABLE. BUT YOU COULD ALSO PHYSICALLY AND VISIBLY SEE. AS IT PERTAINS TO STUDENTS CONFIDENCE AND PARTICIPATION IN THE CLASSROOM. THE COSBY NINETY PANDEMIC HAS GREATLY AFFECTED ALL OF OUR LIVES AMONG THOSE IMPACTED THE MOST. HAVE BEEN OUR STUDENTS. AND NOW MORE THAN EVER WE MUST SUPPORT OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY RECEIVE THE CRTICAL INSTRUCTION EARLY ON. SO THAT THEY ARE SOCIALLY AND ACADEMICALLY PREPARED FOR A LIFETIME OF SUCCESS. STUDENTS WHO DO NOT ATTEND KINDERGARTEN ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY IN FIRST GRADE. AND BECAUSE OF THAT OUR TEACHERS AND PARENTS AS WELL. THE TEACHERS ARE SPENDING MORE TIME TRYING TO TEACH THEM THE FOUNDATIONAL MATERIALS AND SKILLS THAT THEIR PEERS HAVE ALREADY MASTERED IN KINDERGARTEN. ADDITIONALLY OUR TEACHERS ARE STRUGGLING JUST TO FIND WAYS TO SUPPORT THOSE STUDENTS AND CONFINING- CHALLENGING TRYING TO CATCH THEM UP. WHEN THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TO SCHOOL WE MUST INVEST IN EARLY EDUCATION TO HELP OLDER STUDENTS AND TEACHERS SO OUR STUDENTS CONTINUE TO LEARN AT GRADE LEVEL STANDARDS AND DON'T FALL FURTHER BEHIND WHICH CAUSES A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN LATER YEARS. I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE WHY THIS BILL IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AND URGENT NOW. ALSO STATE WE ARE SEEING A LARGE DROP IN SCHOOL ENROLLMENT. THE PANDEMIC HAS LED TO A RECORD ONE YEAR ENROLLMENT DROP OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S KATE THROUGH TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ACCORDING TO NEW STATE PROJECTIONS. THIS DROP IS EVEN MORE PREVALENT IN THE KARTING KINDERGARTEN LEVEL. IN ROMAN AT THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED THIS DOCUMENT ACADEMIC YEAR. KINDERGARTEN ENROLLMENT FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE ACADEMIC YEAR HAS DROPPED BY 14% THAT'S A DECLINE OF SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS. ESPECIALLY IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SLOW IS INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND THIS DECLINE IS ABOUT- THREE TIMES AS LARGE AS IN RECENT YEARS. SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ALSO SAW A DECLINE OF SEVENTEEN POINT 6% OAKLAND UNIFIED A 9% DECLINE ALONG BEACH UNIFIED A EDUCATORS WILL FEEL GREATER VARIANCE OF SKILLS AMONG FIRST GRADE STUDENTS AND IT IS CRITICAL THAT OUR STUDENTS GET A HEAD START. AND HAVE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND NOT FALL FURTHER BEHIND AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME OF CATCH UP WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY- WORSE AS THEY GO UP THE SCHOOL YEARS THE. GAP ONLY GROWS EXPONENTIALLY- SO WE TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FOR THESE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE START AT THE SAME LEVEL AS THEIR PEERS. WE NEED TO GIVE EVERY CHILD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. AND WE TO THAT WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND REQUIRING KINDERGARTEN ATTENDANCE. ON THE PHONE TODAY MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESS ALISON JOSHI MODEL TELL READ.

I GUESS IT JUST FIFTEEN OVER THE YEARS THAT AFTER DISTRICTS STUDENTS IT'S MUCH HIGHER THAN AT THE GREAT FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR DISTRICT REPORTED 25% OF KINDERGARTEN THIS. PMR DAYS EACH SCHOOL YEAR. WHAT IT HADN'T STUDIES CORRELATE THAT DOLLARS TO ARE CHRONICALLY ABSENT INCREASE PLUNGING. AND FIRST GRADE R. PIKES LESS LIKELY TO READ BY THIRD GRADE. STUDENTS WHO CANNOT READ BY GRADE ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN PROFICIENT READERS TO DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. SB SEVENTY IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT IN REDUCING CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AMELIORATING THE OPPORTUNITY GAP ON GETTING OUR STUDENTS EVERY POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE AND EARLY LIFE. AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IS SB SEVENTY CONTINUE TO GET DISTRICTS THAT HONEY OVER OFFERING FULL DAY OR PART DAY CANDOR OUR FAMILIES ON HOW TO ME TO CONTINUE TO SELECT A PRIVATE. SCHOOL OPTION.

SB SEVENTY AMEND THAT PORTION OF THE CODE THAT GOVERNS THE ENROLLMENT ELIGIBILITY OF A STUDENT IN THE FIRST GRADE OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL DUE TO THE CONFUSION REGARDING THE APPLICABILITY WE ARE REQUESTING AN AMENDMENT TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE WITH REGARD TO WHICH SCHOOLS ARE IMPACTED BY THE BILL. PLEASE ACCEPT OUR AMENDMENT TO ADD THE WORDS IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL TO THE KEY PROVISION OF THE BILL TO CLARIFY THIS POINT THE- BACKSEAT IN THE COMEDIAN LSS- WITH EXEMPLIFIED THE NEED FOR CLARIFICATION ON THIS POINT- APPROXIMATELY 95% OF PARENTS ENROLL THEIR CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN. BELIEVING THAT THIS COURSE IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR CHILD. PERSON OF THE REMAINING PERCENTAGE ARE ENGAGED IN SOME OTHER FORM OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SOME MORE FORMAL AND SOME LESS FORMAL. THIS LEAVES A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN WHOSE NEEDS REQUIRE THEIR PARENTS TO INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED AND ADAPT THEIR EDUCATIONAL TIMELINE UNIQUELY TO THEM. THE PARENTS OR GUARDIANS OF THESE INDIIDUALS HAVE DETERMINED THAT IT IS NOT IN THEIR BEST INTEREST TO ENROLL THEM IN KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM BECAUSE OF DISADVANTAGES THAT WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO THAT TRIAL. IT IS BEST TO NOT MANDATE KINDERGARTEN AND ALLOW THESE FEW CHILDREN TO THRIVE IN THEIR OWN WAY UNTIL AGE SIX. THE LEGISLATURE HAS GONE ON RECORD IT KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THERE CAN BE DISADVANTAGES. TO ENROLLING SOME CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN AT AGE FIVE IN THAT PARENTS MUST BE ALLOWED TO CONSIDER THESE DISADVANTAGES IN DECDING WHETHER OR NOT TO ENROLL THEIR CHILD. EDUCATION CODE SECTION FOUR EIGHT ZERO ZERO ZERO B. THE LEGISLATURE AWARE OF THE DISADVANTAGES SPECIFIED THAT THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN IS GIVEN INFORMATION REGARDING THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES. OF ANY OTHER IN ANY OTHER EXPLANATORY INFORMATION ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THIS EARLY ADMITTANCE. WE CANNOT DRAW A LINE SAY WHEN ALL CHILDREN ARE READY FOR SCHOOL WELL THIS BILL DOES NOT DOES ALLOW PARENTS TO CHOOSE TO DELAY THEIR CHILD'S FORMAL EDUCATION. THERE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE PRESSURED TO IGNORE THOSE DISADVANTAGES THAT THE LEGISLATURE SO ADAMANTLY REFERRED TO IN. SECTION FOUR EIGHT ZERO ZERO ZERO WITH RESPECT TO THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD AND TRYING TO A CHILD'S PARENT OR GUARDIAN OF THE SECTION. REQUIRES FOR IT ADMITTANCE YOUNGER THAN AGE PRIVATE SCHOOLS TO MAKE THEIR OWN DETERMINATION TOGETHER WITH PARENTS. AS WHICH CHILD BEST PATH FOR INSTRUCTION IN NOT REQUIRED KINDERGARTEN. FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS. THE GREENER TO DINNER. ALL SHORT GAIN THANK YOU. YOUR EX TIME THANK YOU FOR MUCH MEMBERS WE WILL NOW GO OPPOSITION IN THE GALLERY SEEING NONE WILL GO TO ROOM TWELVE ONE TWELVE SEEING NONE.

THANK YOU MADAM CAIR LINE NUMBER THIRTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. I THINK WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA HOMESCHOOL NETWORK AND WE STRONGLY OPPOSE SB SEVENTY THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY NUMBER FIFTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS HEATHER MARTIN FROM REPRESENTING CELEBRATION EDUCATION AND WE OPPOSE AB SEVENTY I MEAN SB THIRTY THANK YOU. LET THIS TIME OUT I'M SURE WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR MEMBERS WILL BRING IT BACK TO YOU AT THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CENTER TROUBLED. I HAVE A COMMENT HERE WE KNOW TESTING. TESTING YOU SHOULD BE GOOD NOW OKAY- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MADAM CHAIR TO SPEAK THIS MORNING AS A FORMER EDUCATOR AS A MOTHER OF THREE CHILDREN I AM THE FIRST AND FOREMOST TO SAY EDUCATION IS A MUST FOR EVERY CHILD AND DEVELOPMENTALLY IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I LEFT THE CLASSROOM. AND DECIDED TO STAY HOME AND- TEACH MY CHILDREN VIA WHAT I CALL THE PROFESSIONAL PARENT. I EIGHT. I'D LOVE TO TEACH AID LOVED BEING IN THE CLASSROOM BUT BETWEEN DECIDING BETWEEN TEACHING OTHER CHILDREN OR TEACHING MY OWN I DECIDED TO TEACH MY OWN AND THAT'S- IN THAT CONTEXT IN WHICH I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING AND ASKING SOME QUESTIONS- FIRST AND FOREMOST. JUST A AB ONE TO ASK THE AUTHOR. WHEN IT THE STATE MANDATES THAT A CHILD. ATTEND SCHOOL BY A CERTAIN AGE SAY FIRST GRADE. AND UP TOWARD- ARE THERE PENALTIES FOR PARENTS WHO OPTED NOT TO ENROLL THEIR CHILD IN SCHOOL. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION WELL THEY WILL FOLLOW THE OF THE TRADITIONAL ROUTE OF- HAVING THE OPTION FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO USE OUR- TO ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO ATTEND AND JUST LIKE ON A REGULAR SCHOOL. DAY WOULD WORK WITH THE PARENT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HELP ON WITH THE DEFICIENCIES IN TRYING TO GET THEIR STUDENTS TO ATTEND CLASS. BUT ARE THERE PENALTIES AGAINST PARENTS OR CARETAKERS WHO ARE CHOOSING NOT TO. ASK BUT THEIR SCHOOL THEIR CHILDREN IN IN PUBLIC SCHOOL. THERE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED INTO FIRST GRADE UNLESS THEY HAVE THAT THAT- CAN REGARDING YOUR BEFORE ENTERING A PUBLIC SCHOOL. OKAY THE REASON I ASK IS IF. WE ALL KNOW DEVELOPMENTALLY CHILDREN VERY QUITE DISTINCTLY BETWEEN BIRTH AND FIVE YEARS THOSE ARE INCREDIBLY- IMPACTFUL YEARS. AND I AM COMPLETELY AWARE AND COMPLETELY- ENDORSED THE NOTION OF EDUCATION- IN THOSE FIVE YEARS AS BEING PIVOTAL FOR AT THE PROPER SUCCESS FOR KIDS LATER ON BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD. AND GIVING PARENTS THE OPTION AND WHETHER OR NOT- FORMALES KINDERGARTEN IS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THEIR FIVE YEAR OLD OR VERSUS A DIFFERENT MODEL OF SCHOOLING- THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM. SO. MY CONCERN IS THAT IF A PARENT DOES NOT FEEL THAT THEIR CHILD IS- MATURITY EMOTIONALLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND PHYSICALLY TO ATTEND- V. MANDATED TO ATTEND AT A SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA- WE ARE ONE TAKING AWAY THE OPERATIVE OF APPARENT MAKING THAT CHOICE AND NUMBER TWO- I'M CONCERNED THAT THE CHILD'S DEVELOPMENTAL- LEVEL IS. IS NOT BEING CONSIDERED IN THIS BILL- YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. THIS WILL JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL DOES GIVE PARENTS OPTIONS. THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO ENROLL THE CHILD IN KINDERGARTEN BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO TAKE THE HOME SCHOOL OPTION THAT WE'D LIKE YOU DID FOR YOUR OWN CHILDREN AND THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO. ENTER A PRIVATE SCHOOL AS WELL SO AS LONG AS THERE IS SOME TYPE OF EDUCATION PRIOR TO COMING INTO THE FIRST GRADE THOSE ARE THE OPTIONS PARENTS HOUSE SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY MANDATING THAT THEY GO TO PBLIC SCHOOL. THEY'RE GIVEN THE HOME SCHOOL OPTION AS WELL. OKAY SO JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT MANDATING SO PARENTS OR CAREGIVERS WILL NOT BE PENALIZED FOR NOT HAVING A FORMAL. SCHOOL OPTION FOR THEIR CHILDREN. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING FOR MORE ON THE HOME SCHOOL OPTION IT BEARS SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOME SCHOOLING STILL YOU WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE PROOF TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT THEY'VE ATTENDED AND PICK YOUR PRIOR TO COMING TO FIRST GRADE- IN A WAY OF AFFIDAVIT SEOUL. FORMAL MEANS IT HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF CURRICULUM THAT IS THAT IS FORMAL YES OKAY- I'M IN AND THAT'S THE OTHER THAT'S THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO BRING UP IS- THE CURE HIM THERE ARE PHILOSOPHIES WHERE THEY FEEL THAT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE TO HAVE THE FREEDOM. TO NOT BEING A FORMALIZED STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT THAT HAVE THE FREEDOM TO LEARN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND DIFFERENT MANNER SO I AM I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THE END ON ON THAT TO HAVE A FORM CURRICULUM FOR KINDERGARTEN ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY HE SAID I BELIEVE STRONGLY IN EDUCATION I JUST I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT. TAKING THE PARODIC OF APPARENT MAKING A CHOICE BUT MANDATING OR HAVING THE STATE TELEPRINTER THIS IS WHEN WE THINK YOUR CHILD SHOULD BELONG. IN A FORMAL LADY AND- IN A FORMAL. STRUCTURE CURING BAY. ON AGE PROGRAM- THE THAT AND- BUT THAT'S IT. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR AND TROUBLED CAN I ADDRESS YES PLEASE YOU KNOW I JACQUI WANNA- SHE YOUR COMMENTS I JUST. REALLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHARE THAT AT THIS TIME APPROXIMATELY 90% OF STUDENTS ALREADY ATTEND YEAH AND SO WHEN WE SEE WHERE THOSE GAPS ARE UNFORTUNATE ALWAYS HAPPENS TO BE THOSE LOW INCOME COMMUNITY CENSUS. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CAPTURE THOSE PARENTS THAT ARE NOT SOMEONE THAT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME AND CELL ALL OF US HERE ON THIS FLOOR. WHAT EASILY BE ABLE TO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN WE UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM WE UNDERSTAND. YOU BASED ON OUR FORMAL EDUCATION WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR CHILDREN HOWEVER. I CAN THERE IS A PORTION OF CHILDREN THAT ARE STAYING HOME. AND IF THE STATE DOESN'T MANDATE IT IT ALMOST A SENSE A MESSAGE TO THESE PARENTS THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY. AND I CAN SPEAK FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM I HEARD ONE OF THE SPEAKERS SAY THAT HE ASKED A QUESTION TO ONE OF HIS TEACHERS. WELL I CAN ANSWER THAT AS WELL I TAUGHT FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I WAS THE TEACHER THAT CAPTURED THE CHILDREN THAT HAD GAPS IN THEIR EDUCATION. AND MOST OFTEN IT WAS THOSE CHILDREN THAT COME FROM LOW INCOME HOMES WHO DIDN'T ATTEND KINDERGARTEN THAT WERE STRUGGLING. AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY NEVER CAUGHT UP AND- FOR ME THIS IS JUST AN IMPORTANT STEP TO. SEND THE MESSAGE NUMBER ONE THAT KINDERGARTEN IS IMPORTANT AND TO HELP THOSE PARENTS THAT DON'T TRULY UNDERSTAND HOW VALUABLE KINDERGARTEN IS THE TO LEARN FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS AND THAT IS THE BUILDING BLOCKS. TO BE SUCCESSFUL. FROM KATIE THREE THREE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR DOLLARS SENATE BILL I'M SORRY DID YOU WANT TO EXPAND ON THAT YES PLEASE IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND SENATOR TROUBLED CENTER REVIEW WITH THE MOST RESPECT I DO NOT QUESTION AT ALL THE INTENT OF THE PURPOSE OF- OF WANTING TO HAVE. KINDERGARTEN MANDATED I ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY BELIEVE IN THE VALUE OF IT. IT'S JUST. TAKING AWAY THE ACT. THAT PARENTAL CHOICE ON THAT END AND THEN FOLLOWING UP ON THAT YOU DID SAY. BY CARRYING THE MESSAGE ON THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA. TO HAVE KINDERGARTEN AS A- AS A MANDATORY CLASS- WHAT'S- IN THIS BILL WOULD YOU MIND EXPLAINING WHAT THE WHAT. EMPOWER ME DO YOU GIVE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO FOLLOW WITH THOSE PARENTS WHO DO YOU CHOOSE NOT TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN IN IN KINDERGARTEN. WELL EVERY AT WE HEARD ABOUT THE SUPPORTERS IS MOSTLY HILLS SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE. SUPPORTING THIS BILL- BECAUSE THEY SEE JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO WORK WITH PARENTS AND THEIR CAREER YEARS SELL- THAT THEY HAVE THE POWER TO WORK WITH PARENTS LIKE AYE SHORTER AYE FONG. PARENTS ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL THEY WORK WITH THEM AND YOU KNOW I WAS ALSO IN CHARGE OF SARBAND MY SCHOOL AND SO. WE DO GIVE THEM MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO A TWO CORRECT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE ABSENTEEISM OR- SOMETIMES THEY JUST DROP OUT FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS AND SELL THE ALWAYS WORK WITH PARENTS THAT IS THE GOAL OF THE SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE HELP TO PARENTS. AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL. AND DO WE NOT HAVE- RIGHT NOW AS IT STANDS THE MOST COOL DISHES NOT DO THAT ALREADY TO ENCOURAGE- UNIVERSITY I'M JUST SPEAKING FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ON OUR SCHOOL BOARD- WHERE WE- ARE WE EVEN OFFER TKA- CLASSES AND ENCOURAGE OUR PARENTS AND OUR FAMILIES AND PROMOTED LOCALLY. WITHOUT BEING MANDATED WE JUST FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO THAT IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WE ARE AND WE- MARKET. THAT THAT ENDEAVOR SO ARE WE SEEING THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOT DOING THAT IN THESE LOW INCOME- COMMUNITIES THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. NO BECAUSE KINDERGARTEN IS CURRENTLY NOT MANDATED IT STARTS AT SIX YEARS OLD SO THAT THEY CANNOT. YOU KNOW HELP PARENTS BE SUCCESSFUL IN BRINGING THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL BECAUSE- IT IS NOT CURRENTLY MANDATORY. SALAS WE MAC MAKE IT MANDATORY THEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN INTERVENE AND OFFER SUPPORT TO THESE PARENTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING. HI THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER CHOI BOGUE CENTER DOLLY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- JUST QUESTION AUTHORED BY SO LOOK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT I UNDERSTOOD ABOUT 10% OF THE POPULATION IS 90% ARE ALREADY DOING IT. SENATE 10% I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER ANOTHER QUESTIONS WAS THAT. YOU CAN'T ENTER KINDERGARTEN WITHOUT. GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEBODY JUST CHOSE NOT TO DO IT. AND NOW THEIR CHILD IS THERE AT SIX YEARS OLD AND HASN'T HAD THIS COURSE. I THINK I BELIEVE YOU STATED. THAT- I'M SORRY. IF THEY COME TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY US IF THEY COME TO SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU KNOW AND THEY HAVE NOT HAD KINDERGARTEN THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO ATTEND KINDERGARTEN AND YOU STATED YOU KNOW A CHILD BEING SIX I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW OLD THAT INTER CANDOR SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT ALREADY HAPPENS IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS UNUSUAL FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HAVE A- SIX YEAR OLD IN KINDERGARTEN. SO WHAT THE QUESTION I ASKED IS. IF THIS IS GONNA BE MANDATORY AND IF AND IF THEY DON'T DO THE HOMES PART OF IT THEY DON'T DO. THEY DON'T COMPLETE THE TASK SAY THEY JUST pEXPERIENCE I GUESS I SHOULD SAY WITH PARENTS WHO ARE SINGLE PARENTS WHO ARE. NOT CONNECTED TO IT THERE THERE'S THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM I GUESS I SHOULD SAY AND THEY MAY JUST NOT DO IT AT ALL DOES NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT AND THEY MOVE AROUND AND THEY'RE HARD TO TRACK AND ALL THE SUDDEN THEY SHOW UP AT KINDERGARTEN AND THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANY OF THIS STUFF AND THEY'RE AT THE AGE TO GOING TO GET ARE SIX YEARS OLD. WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT. IT IS MANDATORY THEY DON'T HAVE THAT PRE CLASS THEY CAN'T CAN THEY GET IN OR THEY CAN'T GET AND THAT'S THAT'S WHEN THEY CAN GET IN BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE A FULL YEAR OF KINDERGARTEN IN ORDER TO. TO BE PROMOTED TO FIRST GRADE SO WHEN THEY COME AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE THAT ONE YEAR. AND I YOU KNOW AND TO SHARE- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. OUR STUDENTS MOVING AROUND. EVEN IN. MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL THAT'S A SCENARIO THAT HAPPENS THROUGHOUT OUR SCHOOL- OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HOWEVER. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SIX YEAR OLD. THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO COMPLETE THAT FIRST YEAR OF KINDERGARTEN BEFORE BEING PROMOTED TO FIRST GRADE. OKAY MAYBE I'M THIS IS MY FIRST. YEAR ON THIS COMMITTEE AND I I'M NOT THE EXPERT ON. WHAT AGES KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WHERE BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE SEVEN YEARS OLD WHEN YOU GOING TO FIRST GRADE. YES LET ME TRY AND HELP SO IN CALIFORNIA SIX YEARS OLD IT IS COMPULSORY THAT YOU HAVE TO SEND YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING CENTER AT ALL YOU'RE JUST ABOUT GOT THERE WAS IF YOU DON'T SEND YOUR CHILD. TO KINDERGARTEN AT FIVE AND YOU SEND THEM TO SCHOOL AT SIX. YES I SAID RUBIO LET ME KNOW IF I'M WRONG. THEY WOULD START KINDERGARTEN AT SIX YEARS OLD AND THEN THEY WOULD START. FIRST GRADE AT SEVEN YEARS OLD CORRECT. SO TECHNICALLY I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING THEY COULD BE A YEAR. OLDER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER CHILDREN IN THE CLASSROOM. IT ECONOMIC. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT I WANT TO ADD THAT OUR 4% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE. IN THAT SCENARIO THAT THE JUSTICE SO IT'S NOT AN UNUSUAL. CIRCUMSTANCE AND I ALSO KNOW THAT IT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT TAKES. REALLY SERIOUSLY YOU KNOW ABOUT THE WELL BEING OF A CHILD AS AN ADMINISTRATOR I FOUND MYSELF THAT YOU KNOW WHEN CHILDREN WERE BEING SUCCESSFUL. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE. INSTEAD OF RETRAINING A CHILD WE WOULD TAKE THE WHOLE PICTURE INTO CONSIDERATION THE AGE THE SIZE OF THE CHILD. YOU KNOW AND PARENT INPUT CELL SO THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS BECAUSE YOU KNOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CARE ABOUT THE WELL BEING OF THE CHILD FILL. ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS IN THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD DO YOU KNOW WOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THE CHILD'S BEST. INTEREST IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO DOLLY MEMBERS IN OTHER. SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU OF THAT SURE LEYVA WANTED JUST TO. NOTE THAT THIS IS A LEGISLATION THAT'S BEFORE US HAS SOME RICH HISTORY AND EFFORTS BY PREVIOUS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE I KNOW ASSEMBLY WOMAN- BE CANNON FROM MY- AREA HAD- MOVED AT THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION THAT- EIGHT YEARS AGO- AND- I YET I PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE THE EXPERTISE THAT THE AUTHOR BRINGS TO THIS SUBJECT MATTER- BEING A PREVIOUS TEACHER I GUESS YOU'RE ALWAYS A TEACHER YOU NEVER STOP TEACHING- AND I WELL I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT STILL REMAIN AND CERTAINLY THE FISCAL ISSUES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGING ONE. IN THIS SPACE AS IT IS IN PRE K. THE ISSUE OF PRE K. I THINK THIS BILL DESERVES TO GO FORWARD AND- WITH MY SUPPORT. AND BE HAPPY TO MOVE IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS.

SECOND WE CAN DOES NOT ALIGN WITH CURRENT STATE ADOPTED STANDARDS OR FRAMEWORKS THESE CURRENT GUIDING DOCUMENTS RETAIN THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF READING INSTRUCTION. INCLUDING FOUNDATIONAL READING BUT THEY ALSO INCLUDE A MUCH STRONGER EMPHASIS ON LANGUAGE ACQUISITION. FOR BOTH NATIVE AND NON NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS.

BUT CHAU BOGUE COURTESY CURTIS III DELI DELI HI GLAZER GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE PAN PAN I THINK YOU WILL LEAVE THAT ALONE ON CALL FOR SENATOR MCGUIRE THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO NEXT UP WE HAVE SENATOR WIENER WITH SB. THREE SEVENTY NINE CENTER WIENER BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO YOUR IN YOUR COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US. OUR COLLEAGUE SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY NINE- WILL PROHIBIT- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH SYSTEM. FROM ENTERING INTO ANY CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER HEALTH FACILITY. THAT LIMITS THE SERVICES THAT YOU SEE PROVIDERS OR STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE PATIENTS. DUE TO NON CLINICAL DISCRIMINATORY RESTRICTIONS ON CARE. YOU SEE HEALTH SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE BEST HEALTH SYSTEMS IN THE NATION. AND THE WORLD RENOWNED FOR ITS LEADERSHIP. ON AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND LGBTQ INCLUSIVE HEALTH CARE WE SHOULD ALL BE EXTREMELY PROUD. OF YOU SEE HEALTH. UCHEALTH IS ALSO THE FOURTH LARGEST HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE UC RECEIVES APPROXIMATELY NINE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE- EACH YEAR. BY YOU SEE PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE IN TRAINING MEDICAL STUDENTS AND IN PROVIDING HEALTHCARE FOR CALIFORNIANS. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE TREATED BY YOU SEE DOCTORS. NURSES STAFF AND STUDENTS EVERY YEAR AND ONE OF UC'S CORE VALUES IS INCLUSIVE HEALTH CARE. BUT NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE. NO MATTER HOW MARGINALIZED YOU ARE NO MATTER HOW MUCH SOCIETY HAS WRITTEN YOU OFF AND SAID YOU HAVE NO VALUE YOU SEE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH HEALTHCARE. IN PARTICULAR UC PROVIDES EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. AND GENDER AFFIRMING CARE FOR TRANS PEOPLE. DESPITE ALL OF THIS AND DESPITE THE SCORE YOU SEE VALUES OF INCLUSION BUT HEALTHCARE ACCESS WHICH OUR CALIFORNIA VALUES DESPITE THE- UCHEALTH HAS ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS. AND PLANS TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND ITS CONTRACTS OVER TIME. WITH HEALTHCARE FACILITIES THAT IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON MEDICAL CARE BETTER NOT BASED ON SCIENCE AND THAT ARE NOT BASED ON ANY CLINICAL CRITERIA. THIS RESTRICTIONS CAN BE BASED ON POLITICAL VIEWS FOR EXAMPLE A HOSPITAL MANAGEMENTS DECISION THAT IS POLITICALLY OPPOSED. TO CERTAIN PROCEDURES OR FOR EXAMPLE RELIGIOUS VIEWS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A BISHOP DETERMINES THAT CERTAIN HEALTH CARE VIOLATES RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS NOT BASED. ON SCIENCE OR CLINICAL DECISION MAKING. AS PART OF UC'S CONTRACTS WITH THESE HOSPITALS. YOU SEE PHYSICIANS NURSES MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE PROHIBITED FROM PERFORMING THESE RESTRICTED HEALTH CARE PROCEDURES ON YOU SEE PATIENTS WHEN THEY'RE PRACTICING AND IS AFFILIATED HOSPITALS. YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT ARE YOU SEE PHYSICIAN WEARING A UC BAD. BEING PAID BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAN BE PROHIBITED. PERFORMING HEALTHCARE ON PATIENT EVEN IF THE OPPOSITION BELIEVES THAT THE HEALTH CARE IS APPROPRIATE AND MEDICALLY NECESSARY. I WANT TO BE SPECIFIC SOME OF THE RESTRICTIVE CONTRACTS THAT YOU THINK YOU SEE HEALTH HAZARD AND TO. EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT YOU SEE DOCTORS AND STUDENTS FROM THE FOLLOWING. FROM TREATING A MISCARRIAGE WHICH IN SOME HOSPITALS IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN ABORTION IF THERE IS STILL A FETAL HEARTBEAT EVEN IF THE FETUS IS NOT VIABLE. REQUIRING APPARENT SYSTEM IN TURMOIL. WITHOUT HAVING A MISCARRIAGE TREATED UNTIL THE HEARTBEAT STOPS. EVEN IF THE PATIENT IS BLEEDING. ANOTHER XAMPLE PROVIDING EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTIVE CONTRACEPTIVES TO SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. PERFORMING A TUBAL LIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE C. SECTION SO IF SOMEONE COMES IN FOR AN EMERGENCY C. SECTION AND WANTS TO HAVE A TUBAL LIGATION AS PART OF A C. SECTION I CAN'T HAS TO FINISH THE PROCEDURE AND THEN GO TO A DIFFERENT HOSPITAL. TO HAVE A SECOND PROCEDURE FOR THE TUBAL LIGATION EVEN OVER THE UC POSITION PERFORMING THAT C. SECTION. PERFORMING CERTAIN SURGERIES TO ADDRESS AT A TOPIC PREGNANCY FANS. INSERTING AN R. U. T. AND A WOMAN BANNED THE UC POSITION CAN DO THAT SOME OF THESE HOSPITALS PROVIDING GENDER AFFIRMING CARE TO TRANSGENDER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE A GYNECOLOGIST CAN'T PERFORM A HYSTERECTOMY. ON A TRANS PERSON AS PART OF GENDER AFFIRMING CARE EVEN THOUGH. OTHER PATIENTS CAN RECEIVE A HYSTERECTOMY IN THAT FACILITY. THESE RESTRICTIONS ENDANGER LIVES AND THEY DENIED BASIC HEALTH CARE THE UC POSITION LEAVES AS APPROPRIATE. THIS CONTRACTING PROCESS COLLEAGUES HAS BEEN DONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WITH LIMITED PUBLIC INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF THIS CONTRACT CONTRACTS ON BASIC PREVENTIVE CARE. AND URGENT CARE. THESE DECISIONS ABOUT PATIENTS ADVOCATES LAWMAKERS AND EVEN PRACTITIONERS IN THE DARK ON WHAT THESE CONTRACTS MEAN FOR THE CARE THAT PATIENTS ARE PROVIDED AT THESE FACILITIES. MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YOU SEE COMMUNITY MEMBERS DOCTORS NURSES TRAINEES STUDENTS STAFF HAVE SIGNED AN OPEN LETTER EXPRESSING THEIR OPPOSITION TO THESE DISCRIMINATORY RESTRICTIONS. PHILIBERT NON CLINICAL AND NON SCIENCE BASED HEALTHCARE RESTRICTIONS THAT I BASIC CARE AND SERVICES TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PROTECTED BY CALIFORNIA LAW. THIS HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON PATIENTS OF COLOR PATIENTS WITH LOW INCOME. LGBTQ PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY FACE TREMENDOUS BARRIERS TO CARE. I WANTED TO KNOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN RECEIVE OPPOSITION LETTERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION FROM THE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS AND A LETTER OF CONCERN FROM YOU SEE. THESE LETTERS AND I JUST WANT TO BE HONEST HAVE BEEN LESS THAN STRAIGHTFORWARD. ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE RESTRICTIONS. BOB AT ABOUT THE IMPACTS TO CARE. THE OPPOSITION AND CONCERN LETTERS BARELY EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THESE RESTRICTIONS EXIST THEY MAKE IT SEEM LIKE EVERYONE GETS ALL THE CARE THAT THEY NEED AT THESE FACILITIES WHICH IS SIMPLY UNTRUE. A CATHOLIC HOSPITALS LETTER TALKS ABOUT HOW THE CAPITALIST WORLD PROVIDE ALL SORTS OF CARE TO LGBTQ PEOPLE WITHOUT MENTIONING THAT THE EXPLICITLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST TRANS PEOPLE AND TELL THEM YOU CAN'T GET SERVICES IN THIS HOSPITAL YOU NEED TO GO TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL. IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING. IF THE UC THINKS THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR YOU SEE POSITION TO BE PROHIBITED FROM PERFORMING A TUBAL LIGATION DURING A C. SECTION. OR FROM FROM- FROM PROVIDING GENDER AFFIRMING CARE. THE YOU SAY THE UC SHOULDN'T DANCE AROUND THAT THE UC SHOULD SAY IT. AND YOU SEE SAID EXPLICITLY ADMIT THESE RESTRICTIONS AND THE FANDOM. YOU SEE DOESN'T DO THAT. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DEFEND THEM BECAUSE FRANKLY I THINK THEY'RE EMBARRASSED TO DEFEND THEM BECAUSE THESE RESTRICTIONS COMPLETELY CONTRADICT YOU SEE VALUES. THE IMPACTS THAT WE SEE FROM THE OPPOSITION THIS IS GOING TO AND CARE FOR POOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA FOR MEDICAL PATIENTS THAT IS SIMPLY UNTRUE THIS IS A TINY PERCENTAGE. OF THE UC- REVENUE OF YOU SEE CARE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS YOU SEE AS PART OF ITS BUSINESS STRATEGY EXPANDS THESE DISCRIMINATORY AFFILIATIONS. AND IN TERMS OF CARE. IT IS NOT GOOD CARE TO TELL PEOPLE ON MEDICARE ALL THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH CARE THE MEDICAL COVERS WHETHER IT'S GENDER AFFIRMING CARE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. IF THE UC SHARES THE VALUES OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU SEE ABSOLUTELY SHARE THE VALUES THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DEFENDING HIS CONTRACTS AT THE EXPENSE. OF THE LIVES AND WELL BEING OF WOMEN AND LGBTQ PEOPLE AND YOU SEE SHOULD BE ACTIVELY SEEKING ALTERNATIVES. WE ARE SEEING COLLEAGUES TRENDS AROUND THE COUNTRY WITH STATE MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR WOMEN TO GET REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND WE KNOW THERE ARE STATES WHERE THAT IS EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. AND WE SEE STATES NOW BANNING GENDER AFFIRMING CARE. FOR PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. WE SHOULD NOT BE ENABLING AND PROMOTING POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE IT HARDER AND HARDER FOR WOMEN AND LGBTQ PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. BOB THIS LEGISLATION IS SPONSORED BY EQUALITY CALIFORNIA BY NAY ROLE AND THE ACLU AND SUPPORTED BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEALTH ACCESS AND A HUGE COALITION. OF HEALTH JUSTICE AND LGBT. ORGANIZATIONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY TESTIFIED OUR DOCTOR VANESSA JACOBY A GYNECOLOGIST A UCSF. LARA AND EVAN. A TRANS MAN WHO WAS DENIED GENDER AFFIRMING HEALTH CARE- WITH US TODAY ALSO NOT TO SPEAK BUT TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS ELIZABETH GILL WITH THE ACLU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR WIENER- MADAME MODERATOR IF YOU WILL QUEUE UP OUR TO LEAD WITNESSES DR JACOBY AND EVAN MINTON PLEASE. BLINDER OPEN. YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES. HEY THIS IS EVAN MINTON THANK YOU CHARLIE THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM HONORED TO BE A WITNESS MANY OF YOU KNOW MY STORY BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU HEARING TODAY. SEVERAL YEARS AGO MY DOCTORS DETERMINED THAT A HYSTERECTOMY WAS MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR ME AS PART OF MY COURSE OF TREATMENT FOR GENDER DYSPHORIA I WAS SCHEDULED TO UNDERGO THE SURGERY AT MERCY SAN JUAN MEDICAL CENTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. TWO DAYS BEFORE THE SURGERY I MENTIONED TO A NURSE THAT I WAS TRANSGENDER. THE VERY NEXT DAY DAYS. BEFORE MY SURGERY WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE. THE HOSPITAL CANCELED IT. EVEN THOUGH MY DOCTOR REGULARLY PERFORMS HYSTERECTOMIES AT MERCY SAN JUAN SHE WAS INFORMED THAT SHE WOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO PERFORM THE OPERATION ON ME. IN SHORT BECAUSE I AM TRANSGENDER. WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS I REMEMBER BEING SO DEVASTATED THAT I CLAPPED TO THE GROUND I WAS HORRIFIED. AT THE HOSPITAL WHICH REFUSING TO TREAT ME SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHO I AM. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE FACT THAT THE SURGERY WAS CANCELED AND DANGEROUSLY PUT ALL OF THE OTHER TREATMENTS I HAD SCHEDULED AN FLAT. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS MY ALMA MATER. I AM TESTIFYING TODAY BECAUSE THEY HAD ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS WITH MERCY SAN JUAN AND OTHER HOSPITALS LIKE IT. UNDER THESE CONTRACTS THANK YOU SEE DOCTOR PRACTICING AT MERCY SAN JUAN WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DENY. TRANSGENDER PEOPLE CARE. I AM ALSO TESTIFYING TODAY BECAUSE TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION R. TO WHY. I'M GONNA REPEAT THAT TWICE AS LIKELY TO COMMIT SUICIDE. PLEASE DON'T ALLOW THE UC TO REQUIRE DISCRIMINATION. PLEASE DON'T PUT LIVES AT RISK. THANK YOU MISTER MINTON NEXT UP DR JACOBY PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING I DON'T OBSTETRICIAN GYNECOLOGIST AT UC SAN FRANCISCO I GRADUATED FROM UC BERKELEY AND I DID ALL OF MY MEDICAL TRAINING AT UCSF. THANK YOU SEE I HAVE BEEN INSTILLED WITH OUR CORE VALUES TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY CARE FOR ALL PATIENTS IN AN ENVIRONMENT FREE OF DISCRIMINATION. THAT IS PRECISELY WHY I SUPPORT SB THREE SEVENTY NINE. THE MOST COMMON POLICY BASED RESTRICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS PROHIBIT ME FROM PLACING AN IED ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION. EIGHT PROHIBIT ME FROM PERFORMING A TUBAL LIGATION EVEN DURING A SUPERION SECTION THE MOST EFFECTIVE TIME FOR TRIPLE IDEATION. WHEN I CARE FOR A PATIENT WITH A MISCARRIAGE I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM STANDARD PROCEDURES TO REMOVE AND NONVIABLE AND BRIO. THEY PROHIBIT BURN AND ELDER NATION AND IN VITRO FERTILIZATION THESE ARE THE ONLY MEDICAID AVAILABLE FOR LGBT PEOPLE TO HAVE BIOLOGICAL CHILDREN. AND I AM PROHIBITED FROM DOING A HYSTERECTOMY FOR A TRANSGENDER PERSON EVEN THOUGH ALL OF MY OTHER PATIENTS CAN UNDERGO HYSTERECTOMY. TRANSFERRING MY PATIENT TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL FOR THE SERVICES DOES NOT MITIGATE THE HARM. IF I WORK IN A HOSPITAL THAT PROHIBITS ESSENTIAL REPRODUCTIVE AND GENDER AFFIRMING HEALTHCARE IT FEELS LIKE STANDING UNDER A SIGN ON THE DOOR THAT SAYS WE DON'T SERVE WOMEN AND LGBT PEOPLE ALL. THAT IS NOT THE CARE I SHOULD PROVIDE WEARING MY NEWSFEED BAGGAGE WHEN I REPRESENT THE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES OF OUR RENOWNED PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THAT IS NOT THE CARE I WAS TAUGHT TO PROVIDE IN MY UC TRAINING IT'S NOT THE CARE I KNOW TEACH. MEDICAL STUDENTS. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB THREE SEVENTY NINE.

WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION WE DO HAVE TO LEAD OPPOSITION CATHERINE SCOTT FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. AND CLICK HERE AND FLATTERY- FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MISS SCOTT ARE YOU READY. I AM GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING BILL RIGHT HEY KATHERINE ABOUT WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS THAT THE ASIAN- AFFILIATIONS AMONG HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE CANADIAN HELP TO ENSURE ACCESS TO PATIENTS ACROSS ALL PATIENT CARE ENVIRONMENT. THE TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIALTY CARE SERVICES INCLUDING PEDIATRIC CARE CANCER CARE MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND CRITICALLY RELEVANT TO THE COMMUNITY THE COMMITTEE. THE SOLUTIONS INCLUDE THE CONTINUING EDUCATION OF HUNDREDS OF PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING A RESIDENCY PROGRAM COSTS EIGHT. THIS BILL WOULD UNDERMINE AND COULD UNRAVEL ACCESS VITAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME AND GLOBAL POPULATIONS AND AS A RESULT THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION NOT YET CLOSE. BECAUSE OF THE EXTENT OF WORK WITH THE UC SYSTEM WITH MANY OF OUR HOSPITALS INCLUDING RELIGIOUSLY AFFILIATED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS MANY OF THE SHARED PROGRAM BENEFIT PATIENTS SIMPLE UNDERSERVED AND MARGINALIZED THE- PROGRAM SUPPORT ON MEDICAL THINKING THAT ENTRY- STATE. MOST OF THE LOCATION THE FILIATION FROM HOSPITAL LIKELY YOU'D BE TO EXPAND ITS EXPERTISE. THREE SUBSEQUENTLY READ. HEALTH NORMAL. ONE OF ALL. COPLEY PROPER. IT IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE BILL IS VERY BROAD ARE YOU SEE HEALTH. AND BEAUTY HELD A CONTRACT WITH MANY HEALTHCARE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ALL HOSPITALS WE CULTIVATE THE PHYSICIAN. ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED IN THE HOSPITAL THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED AS NON CLINICAL. REASON COULD BE BASED ON CLINICAL NEED QUALITY MEASURES FOR THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS OR LIMITATIONS. SEVERAL PARTNERSHIPS LIKE THOSE WITH YOU SEE ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURING ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CARE AND PROVIDER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES. FOCUSING ON THE MOST RELEVANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TODAY CLINICAL EDUCATION AND RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ARE FOR PHYSICIANS NURSES AND OTHER ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONAL BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULT IN MULTIPLE STATES. FROM ABOUT MULTIPLE SITES EXCUSE ME FROM VIOLATE THE HUMBLE I'M PROVIDING CRITICAL CARE CRITICAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED RESIDENTS IN TRAINING FOR EXAMPLE OUR INDIGNITY HEALTH ABILITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE RATE INCREASE INLAND EMPIRE ARNOLD. SOME OF THESE ARE CRITICALLY THANK YOU MISCAST. WILL UNDER THE- BUT YOU'VE EXCEEDED YOUR TIME ARE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FIND YOUR INSULARITY UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS I JOIN YOU TO EXPRESS THE UNIVERSITY CONCERN COMMISSION ON SB THREE SEVEN NINE. NOT OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE SHARED GOAL OF ADVANCING BOTH NON DISCRIMINATORY MEDICAL CARE. AND ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR WIENER BRING GAUGING DIRECTLY WITH UC'S PRESIDENT DR MICHAEL DRAKE OVER MANY MONTHS TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES AND WE ARE HOPEFUL A DIFFERENT PATH FORWARD CAN BE IDENTIFIED. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS OPPOSED TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS USING NON MEDICAL POLICIES TO DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF CARE. IN OTHER WORDS WE DO NOT AGREE WITH THE POLICY BASED RESTRICTIONS THAT SOME HEALTHCARE FACILITIES IMPOSED THAT LIMITS THE TYPE OF SERVICES THAT CAN BE PROVIDED THERE AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOU SEE POSITION. PLAN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ADVANCING HIGH QUALITY EVEN LIFESAVING CARE FOR PEACE IN PATIENTS WHO SEEK TREATMENT AT THE FACILITY. SO WE WANT TO WORK TOWARD ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION WE WANT TO WORK TOWARD ELIMINATING HEALTH INEQUITY FOR ALL PATIENTS. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE UNIVERSITY FROM SERVING PATIENTS THAT WE CURRENTLY SIR INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE SERIOUSLY L. AND BENEFIT FROM THE LIFESAVING TREATMENT YOU SEE PHYSICIANS PROVIDE. WHAT WE HAVE DONE AFTER HEARING THE IMPORTANT CONCERNS RAISED BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND LEGISLATORS YOU THE MAN OUR CONTRACTS WITH THESE PROVIDERS THAT HAVE THESE POLICY BASED RESTRICTION. TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR POSITION AND TRAINEES ARE PROTECTED IN THEIR ABILITY TO ADVISE PRESCRIBING AND MAKE REFERRALS IN A WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL JUDGMENT. AND THE NEEDS AND WISHES OF. THEIR PARENTS THAT THEIR PATIENTS. THANK YOU VERY HOPEFUL THAT A DIFFERENT YOU CAN BE A DE. THANK FIXING ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS WILL NOW NEW MOVE TO OPPOSITION IN THE GALLERY SEEING THEN WILL MOVE TO ROOM ONE TWELVE SEEING NONE.

THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR MEMBERS AT THIS TIME WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DO WE HAVE THE SENATOR PAN. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE OPPOSITION YOU TESTIFIED POSSIBLE CESSATION USE IF THEY'RE- IF AVAILABLE TO ANSWER VERY GOOD- IS THAT MISTER FLATTERY- IF YOU ARE IN QUEUE IF THE MODERATOR CAN OPEN YOUR LINES THAT WOULD BE GREAT I'M HERE. OKAY THANK YOU- SO I YEAH I APPRECIATE BOTH THE PRESENTATION FROM THE AUTHOR AND YOUR OPPOSITION IN FACT MANY OF THE POINTS YOU MAKE IN YOUR OPPOSITION NIGHT AT THE MINUTE DON'T DISAGREE WITH. SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY WAS PREVIOUSLY FACULTY MEMBER YOU SEE IN FACT ACTUALLY I WAS DIRECTED RESIDENCY PROGRAM- I GUESS WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS- IS SOMEONE WHO IS OF SPONSORED BILL FOR THE EDUCATION OF RESIDENTS AND CERTAINLY REALIZE HOW DIFFICULT IS GET CLINICAL SITES AND THE VALUE OF CLINICAL SITES IN OUR HOSPITALS RIGHT DIFFERENT HOSPITAL SOMETIMES NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE YOUR HOME CENTER ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTER. BUT WIDER AND MY TEACHING. MY RESIDENT PHYSICIANS. THE ONES WHO I WILL EVENTUALLY NEED TO CERTIFY TO BE IN THE FIELD AND THE FAMILY PRACTICE. IF THEY'RE A FACILITY. WHERE THEY SEE OR EXPERIENCE- THE INABILITY TO PROVIDE THE CARE. THAT IS RECOMMENDED THE ONES THAT FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES THAT ARE PUT OUT BY MY OWN PROFESSION- IN PEDIATRICS SELF EXAMPLE TRANSGENDER CARE THE AMERICAN CAVEAT SIX HAS. SOME VERY- SOME YOU KNOW GUY- BASICALLY- GUIDELINES- I WOULD SAY DEAL OF PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AROUND THAT AND WHEN THE INSTITUTION ITSELF SAYS NO WE CAN'T PROVIDE IT. WE REFUSED TO PROVIDE IT- NOT BASED ON SCIENCE BUT ON I GUESS WE INCOME POLICY POLITICS WHATEVER OTHER REASON. SO WHAT IS THE SOLUTION TO THAT THEN- AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS ITS EMERGENCY CARE AS WELL. AND SO I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION IS SO APPRECIATE THE POINTS HE MADE  NICE AND CERTAINLY I THINK MANY HOSPITALS. ARE OUT THERE TO PROVIDE HIM REALLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR NOT ONLY CLINICAL TRAINING BUT ALSO OF COURSE CLINICAL SERVICES AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO CANCEL SERVICES BY GETTING SPECIALIST FROM YOU SEE OVER THERE. AND HAVING TRAINEES AND I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE NUMBER OF TRAINEES IN THESE HOSPITALS AND AS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY RAN A TRAINING PROGRAM- YET THAT. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD AN ANSWER THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. WHAT WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO THIS THAN. SURE RECOMMEND I DON'T WANNA GO OVER ARE YOU SEE COLLEAGUES- FIRM OKAY I CAN TELL YOU THAT MY UNDERSTANDING AND CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SAUDIS THAT- THAT LIMIT SOME OF THE PROCEDURES ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY PROCEDURES THAT ARE NOT LIMITED THAT ARE DONE AND I DON'T I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND I KNOW ALL THE STOP STOP STOP WE DO WE HAVE HEARD THE- IN OPPOSITION I JUST WANNA TALK ABOUT THE ONES THAT BEING FORBIDDEN. NOT BASED ON. SCIENCE IN FACT ARE CONTRARY TO THE PROFESSIONAL GUIDELINES OVER OWN SPECIALTY. AGAINST WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TEACHING. ONE OF MY SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT THAT IT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT THE MEDICAL RESIDENTS YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE TYPES OF TRAINING- THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER THOSE RESIDENCY PROGRAM- FISHING DAY HE SHOULD AND THEY HAVE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AND EVERY CLINICAL SITE THEY ARE LOCATED NOT JUST THAT SOME AFTER ALL THESE ARE THE GUIDELINES. THAT IS A TEACHER AND CLINICAL RESIDENCY. CORRECTIVE THIRD OF CLINICAL RESIDENCY PROGRAM WHERE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND AND LEARN AS MEDICAL SPEAKER MY UNDERSTANDING IS AND I NEEDED A PART OF THE SEASON MAY HAVE MORE EXPERTISE HERE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY HAVE ACCESS AND ARE TRAINED. TO DO THE MEDICAL PROCEDURES REQUIRED- ALL MEDICAL PROCEDURES REQUIRED AND NOT INCLUDE SOME OF THOSE THAT ARE LIMITED AT THE FACILITY IN THEIR TRAINING FOR THAT LEVEL. OKAY AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING THOSE PROCEDURES- THEY ARE- THERE ARE. ALL OF THOSE FACILITIES ARE TRAINED AND YOU KNOW TO REFER. OUT AS WELL SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ALL CRICKETERS ARE TRAINED IN THOSE FACILITIES BUT THE CARE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ABOUT OKAY SELINEXOR DO ANY INTERVIEWS SEE THAT WHEN. OF TOP FOR MOMENT OF YOU SEE ANSWERS- AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE SORT OF IN A DIFFICULT POITION BECAUSE- YOU'RE TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY TO RUN NOT ONLY RUN A RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAM BUT ALSO SAT ON THE BOARD AND ACCREDITATION BODY- THE ACGME THAT OVERSEES THE QUALITY OF THE TRAINING. AND AND NO AND SO YOU KNOW I REALIZE YOU MAY NOT. WITH THIS BECOMES A MAJOR PROBLEM AND- SO EXCEEDS THE V. TURNED IT OVER TO. A REPRESENTATIVE YOU SEE SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO IS FACULTY. WHEN WE HAVE THE TRAINEES AT SITES WHERE ESSENTIALLY. TO BEING TOLD THEY CANNOT FOLLOW THE STANDARD OF CARE. HELLO THANK VERY MUCH DOT CAN HEAR INPUT FROM SEE- ARE. AND OUR TREE- OFFERING A G. B. T. Q. INCLUSIVE. ABOARD CARE MISS. BACK TO LIGATION IT BETTER- ON IS SOMETHING THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DOES DO. YOU ARE CORRECT THAT SOME OF THE TRAINEES ARE IMPLICIT BUT THESE WHERE CERTAIN SERVICES FOR POLICY BE STREET AND- ARE IN FACT RESTRICTED. WE DO HAVE AN EXPECTATION. THAT ARE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN AND OUR OUR RESIDENTS ARE- TRAINEES. ARE OPERATING BASED ON THEIR BEST MEDICAL VALUES AND JUDGMENTS. THAT THEY DON'T CHECK THEIR VALUES AT THE DOOR AND THAT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO YOU- PROCEED IN THAT WAY. SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE- WE DON'T AGREE THAT THE FACILITIES SHOULD HAVE THOSE KIND OF RESTRICTIONS- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE UNIVERSITY AFFILIATING IN THOSE INSTANCES WITH HOSPITALS WHERE THEY DO HAVE THE RESTRICTION. IS STILL PREFERABLE- FOR PATIENTS. ARE BEING SEEN AT THOSE FACILITIES. YOU CAN THEN HAVE ACCESS TO POSITION YOU ARE GUARANTEED THE ABILITY. TO FACILITATE REFERRALS AND TO PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION AND TO PROVIDE MEDICAL CONSULTATION. SO- I HAVE THE CHALLENGING TO. YOU AND HAS AGAIN TO SOMEONE WHO SERVED ON THE FACULTY AND HAD RUN A TRAINING PROGRAM AT UC- BUT THIS IS VERY TROUBLESOME TO ME- AND YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO TRYING TO ADDRESS- HI. I THINK THAT I NEED TO HEAR BETTER SOLUTIONS- THIS IS A YEAH I'VE BEEN AT THIS IS I THINK IS SOMEWHAT IMPERFECT SOLUTION BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE NUMBER OF THE- THE SOLUTION REALLY IS THAT REQUIRING HOSPITALS TO ALLOW PHYSICIANS. TO FOLLOW STANDARD OF CARE NO MATTER WHERE IT GOES. I MEAN EIGHTY THAT REALLY S THE ULTIMATE ANSWER THAT WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT- WHICH IS OF COURSE YOU KNOW PRIOR PERHAPS MORE IN THE REALM OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE IN THIS THE- EDUCATION COMMITTEE BUT- I DO UNDERSTAND THIS BILL IS I THINK REFER TO THE PASSES OUT THIS COMMITTEE REFERRED TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. I HAPPEN TO CHAIR THAT COMMITTEE I EXPECT TO HEAR MORE SPECIFIC ANSWERS ABOUT THE HEALTH ASPECTS OF THIS BILL- BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES  VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND CERTAINLY SOMEONE WHO. IS BEEN YEAH VERY STEEPED IN MEDICAL EDUCATION- I CERTAINLY VERY- DOT JUST SYMPATHETIC BUT- YOU KNOW SHARED AUTHORS CONCERNS. AND WELL WHAT ARE WE TEACHING OUR OUR RESIDENTS AND MEDICAL STUDENTS AS WELL AS WHAT KIND OF THINGS OR WHAT KIND THAT'S A CHOICE ANY TO THE FACULTY. THAT YOU SEE- WHEN WE ALLOW. AN INSTITUTION TO BASICALLY REFUSE TO ALLOW THEM TO FOLLOW THE STANDARD OF CARE. TO PROVIDE THE KERRY THE QUALITY OF CARE. THAT WE WANT THEM TO PROVIDE- HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THOSE FACULTY MEMBERS AND RESIDENTS AND STUDENTS AT UC SO WITH THAT- I YOU KNOW I ATTORNEY I WANT TO SEE THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TO HEALTH SO I'M GOING TO MOVE ASKED THAT WE MOVED TO BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME- BUT I DEFINITELY LIKE YOU'RE MUCH BETTER ANSWERS TO THESE ISSUES. BEFORE THAT SHOWS UP IN HEALTH COMMITTEE- FOR OUR HEARING THANK YOU IS IT **** OUT THIS COMMITTEE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. CENTER PAN VICE CHAU CHOI BOGUE. I HAVE A QUESTION- I DON'T COME FROM THE MEDICAL PROFESSION- THE SURVEY. PERHAPS BUT I HAVE A QUESTION. ARE THERE ANY SPECIALIZED HOSPITALS THAT- I TEND TO- THE ISSUES AT HAND THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE. I CAN THINK OF IS. KOSTENLOS THE YOU KNOW THAT SPECIALIZE IN CANCER OR CERTAIN AREAS- DO WE HAVE ANY SPECIALIZED HOSPITALS THAT WE COULD WORK WITH. TO MEET THE NEED TO WE DON'T HAVE THE SPECIALTIES IN OTHER IN OTHER HOSPITALS. I'M GONNA ASK THE AUTHOR IF HE WOULD LIKE ON THE SENATOR PANDA ANSWER THAT OR IF HE WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THAT. ONE WHAT PERHAPS- THE EXPERT OKAY. REALLY HAPPY TO SEE I JUST YOU KNOW IT UP THROUGH THE CHAIR BECAUSE FUNDING FOR NOT JUST ENGAGING DEBATE DIRECTLY. CERTAINLY THERE ARE VARIETY DIFFERENT HOSPITALS THAT SPECIALIZE IN CERTAIN THINGS ARE WE HAVE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS WITHOUT HASSLES A CONSTRUCT CANCER WE HAVE REHABILITATION HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS AND SO FORTH SO THERE ARE HOSPITALS. THAT PROVIDE RIGHT BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT FOR EXAMPLE JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE CANCER YOU MEDIA HOSPITAL SPECIALIZES IN CANCER DOESN'T MEAN ALL THE OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS GO AWAY. SO OFTEN TIMES WELL THE HOSPITAL MAY FOCUS ON PARTICULAR ASPECTS. OFTENTIMES THE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE PROVIDING SOME OTHER FORMS OF CAREAS WELL BECAUSE FAMILY IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS WHILE THEY TRY TO BE SURE YOU GOT ALL YOUR MEDICAL ISSUES SETTLED THE HUNTER NOT YOU KNOW NOT EVERYTHING IS. AS IT GOES AWAY WITH THAT HAS A CURE RIGHT AWAY SO- THERE IT DOESBLEED OVER INTO AGENCY THERE'S CARE FOR OTHER TYPES OF HEALTH ISSUES. AT EVEN THE SPECIALIZED HOSPITALS. VENTURA CAN- PLEASE FOR THAT OCCURRED HERE- AND I THINK. OUR GO TO PAN PUT IT REALLY WELL IN AND TO BE MORE. ON BECAUSE THE USE. AND THE HOUSE ASSOCIATION POINT ITSELF. AFFILIATION WHERE YOU SEE THE OR CANCER SPECIAL SERVICE INTO A OF THE TOP. YES TREATING FOR CANCER- BUT THE CANCER PATIENT MIGHT BE A WOMAN PREGNANT- AND SO THAT REDUCES OWN MEDICAL ISSUES THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CANCER SPECIALIST. YOU KNOW THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE FOR CARE FOR THE CANCER PATIENT MIGHT BE TRANS AND THERE MIGHT BE ISSUES ABOUT HOW DO WE DO WE NEED TO ADJUST ANY HORMONES OR TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. AND SO WHEN WE HAVETHESE THESE NON SCIENCE BASED RESTRICTIONS THAT CONTRADICTS. THE STANDARD OF CARE. YOU END UP HAVING PATIENTS THAT THEIR HEALTHCARE IS UNDERMINED EVEN UPON THE SERVICE REALLY WILL TELL ME CANCER NO GOES MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT SO IT'S IT REALLY IS BROADER- THAN ONE pWOULD THINK IN TERMS OF THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU CENTER. FOR TROUBLED TO HEAR FURTHER FOLLOW UP I DO I DO HAVE A STATEMENT THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE- WITH REGARDS TO MY TO MY AREA AND- I AM VERY SYMPATHETIC. TO THE CONCERNS AND I THINK I'M GONNA TAKE IT FROM AN ANGLE OF. THE SHORT IS A SHORT SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE AND THEM SPECIALLY IN MY REGION. I HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH HOW SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY FIVE WILL AFFECT MY DISTRICT- THE INLAND EMPIRE. HAS LONG SUFFERED FROM A SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS COMPARED TO OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION THE REGION ONLY HAS ONLY THIRTY FIVE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. LET ME REPEAT THAT AGAIN. THIRTY FIVE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE. COMPARED TO SEVENTY OR MORE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. THAT SHORTAGE IS ONE OF THE REASONS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OPENED ITS NEWEST MEDICAL SCHOOL THERE. ALONG WITH A MODEL THAT RELIES ON COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AS A PLACE FOR TRAINING. IN PATIENT CARE RATHER THAN OWNING OR OPERATING ITS OWN HOSPITALS AS IS THE CASE I. UC'S OTHER HELP CAMPUSES. UCR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WHICH WERE VERY PROUD OF. IS ENTIRELY RELIANT AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AND FACILITIES IN THE REGION TO TRAIN OUR MEDICAL STUDENTS AND SUPPORT A RESIDENCY AND FELLOWSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMS. YOU SEE ARE DEVELOPED A BROAD ARRAY OF EDUCATIONAL AFFILIATION AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTY PRIVATE FOR PROFIT AND PRIVATE NON. FOR PROFIT HOSPITALS ACROSS THE REGION NO SINGLE HOSPITAL PROVIDES THE ENTIRE TRAINING EXPERIENCE FOR ALL OUR STUDENTS AND TRAINEES. YOU SEE OUR HAS BUILT SUCCESSFUL MEDICAL PIPELINE PROGRAMS WITH REGIONAL K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND HAS EXECUTED IMPACTFUL COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS SUCH AS STREET MEDICINE SERVING MEDICALLY VULNERABLE. AND ON HEALTH RESIDENTS AND CO HOSTED COVE IN NINETEEN CLINICS SERVING FARMWORKERS. ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE RELIANT ON MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS. SEVERAL OF THESEAFFILIATIONS SUCH AS THOSE WITH DIGNITY ST BERNARDINE MEDICAL CENTER AND LOMA LINDA MEDICAL CENTER BOTH HOSPITALS OF WHICH HAVE SERVED MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS. WOULD BE PROHIBITED IF S. B. THREE SEVEN NINE FOUR TWO PASSED IN ITS CURRENT FORM. SEVERELY LIMITING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE POSITIONS TO FULFILL MANDATORY EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS. WITH SB THREE SEVENTY NINE ALL OF YOU SEE OUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SPONSORED RESIDENCY AND FELLOWSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMS EXCEPT PSYCHIATRY WILL BE ELIMINATED. WITHOUT A PRIMARY AFFILIATE HOSPITAL YOU SEE OUR WILL LOSE ACCREDITATION FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND WE'LL NEED TO CLOSE THEM. THIS BILL ALSO CALLS INTO QUESTION THE FUTURE OF YOU SEE OUR COMMUNITY BASED MEDICAL SCHOOL. ELIMINATIONOF PARTNERS SUCH AS THESE WOULD MAKE THE COMMUNITY BASED MODEL DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN. LASTLY WITH THE ELIMINATION OF THE SEVENTY FOUR SLOTS MORE YOU SEE OUR GRADUATES WILL NEED TO LEAVE THE AREA FOR TRAINING AND WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO RETURN SOMETHING THAT IS MUCH MUCH NEEDED IN MY REGION. YOU SEE ARE WILL LOSE THE CAPACITY TO ATTRACT MEDICAL STUDENTS FROM OTHER SCHOOLS TO OUR REGION FOR TRAINING. ERASING THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IN ADDRESSING THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE IN THAT REGION. THIS WILL LEAVE MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS WITHOUT TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE. ALREADY A MUCH DIFFICULT- THING TO ADDRESS I CANNOT SUPPORT A BILL AT THIS TIME THAT WOULD DEVASTATE MY REGION AND THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER TURBOBIT NEXT SENATOR DOLLY AND THEN SENATOR GLAZERS HUNDRED DOLLARS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK I WANTED JUST TO GO ON RECORD I'M OPPOSING THIS BILL- I WANTED TO SHARE. A LITTLE SOME THOUGHTS- THE GURNEY EDUCATION COMMITTEE THIS IS ABOUT CAN WE TREAT CAN WE TRAIN. THIS I BELIEVE THAT'S WHY IT'S HERE CAN WE TRAIN THESE DOCTORS. AND CLINICIANS IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN GET THE TRAINING THEY NEED- THE NEXT COMMITTEE I BELIEVE. SO FOR ME IS I'M I'M ASSUMING I WAS GONNA SURE HOW THIS IS GOING TO PACK MY DISTRICT I HAVE MERCY DIGNITY BOTH OF MY DISTRICT. AND MANY OF YOU KNOW. THAT I COME FROM BEAVER BUDGET DON'T KNOW BEAVERS. ITS IT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY MY FROM REDDING CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE DIGNITY AND MERCY WE HAVE A SMALL HOSPITAL- A DISTRICT HOSPITAL ACTUALLY MIRRORS WHERE MY CHILDREN WERE BORN- THEY DON'T GIVE THAT SERVICE ANYMORE- AND IF EVEN AS FAR. NORTH OF ME WHICH IS ALMOST TO THE OREGON BORDER IN NEVADA BORDER THERE ARE NO HOSPITALS THAT DELIVER BABIES SO PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW TRAVELING. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES TO HAVE A CHILD. TODAY. IF THIS BILL IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE IT LOOK THIS IS ABOUT CONTRACTING THIS IS ABOUT. HOSPITALS THAT HAVE BELIEVES THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES THAT'S WHERE THIS IS REALLY HAD. IF THESE IF THIS BILL WAS SIGNED INTO LAW AND- THOSE HOSPITALS SHE CHOSE NOT TO CONTRACT WITH THE UC'S. WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THOSE BOTTLES WERE NOT THERE WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DELIVER A BABY. FOR THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL GO VERY WIDE INDEED. AND THERE'S ALSO A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT IT SO. FOR THOSE REASONS AND WHAT THE WITH WHAT THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION- THE- MENTIONED I WILL BE OPPOSING THE BILL TODAY I'M HOPEFUL. THAT THERE CAN BE SOME NEGOTIATIONS WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY. GET THE TRAINING AND GET THE ERVICES THAT THOSE PEOPLE WANT IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT'S WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS GO- BECAUSE WE THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT MAY BE IMPACTED. INDIRECTLY BY THIS ONE ACTION SO I JUST WANT TO GET THAT ON THE RECORD. I WANT TO SET UP I HAVE TO LEAVE YOUR A LITTLE BIT AFTER ACTUALLY BROKE A TOOTH AND I NEED TO GET IT FIXED AND I'M HOPING THAT I GET TO STAY TO VOTE AND- HAVE POST NAVIGATION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER CALLING CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR AND- AND MA'AM. AT FIRST I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I STRONGLY REPRODUCTIVE- AND GENDER AFFIRMING SERVICES- I ALSO DON'T SUPPORT RESTRICTIONS ON MEDICAL CARE- FOR WOMEN FOR TRANSGENDER- IN ANY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM- AND I DON'T SUPPORT LIMITATIONS ON IN THE PRACTICING OF MEDICAL CARE AT THE HIGHEST QUALITY LEVEL. BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE ISSUES WITH THIS BILL THAT HAVE RAISED SOME CONCERNS WITH ME- AT THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO SHARE HIS THOUGHTS ON THAT- I WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT WOULD BENEFIT FROM IT. ON THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT IS THE MATTER OF THE ECONOMY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IT WILL BE POLITICS SWIRL AROUND THIS PLACE AND HAVE FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS. AND WE HAVE IN THE WISDOM OF OUR FOUNDERS AND OUR CURRENT. AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE GIVEN A LEVEL OF A TIME TO MEET THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND HOW THEY DO THEIR WORK. AS WE DON'T WANT POLITICS DRIVING. THE ACADEMIC DECISIONS- AND TO SOME LEVEL WE'VE DONE THE SAME WITH THIS THIS THE- THE OTHER FOR YOUR SYSTEM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. AND THE GOAL THERE IS TO ENSURE THAT- THE POLITICAL WINDS OF THE MOMENT. I DON'T INTERFERE WITH THEIR THOUGHTFUL- GOVERNANCE OF THE UNIVERSITY. AND SO IT I UNDERSTAND THE AUTHORS INDICATED THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS AS BEEN. HASN'T HAD A TASK FORCE ON THIS MATTER IS TAKING THE ISSUE SERIOUSLY- WAS PREPARED TO DELIBERATE AND TAKE SOME ACTION ON IT THIS PAST YEAR BUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC QUITE UNDERSTANDABLY- THE MATTER GOT PUT TO THE SIDE BUT THEY HAVE. COMMITTED TO HAVING THAT THOUGHTFUL DELIBERATIONS. AMONG THE BOARD OF REGENTS- AT AND I GUESS WHAT'S TROUBLING TO ME IS THAT WHY WE WOULD GIVEN THE CHANCE TO ACT- THAT- YEAH WE CAN REVIEW THEIR ACTIONS AND DECIDE WHETHER WE THINK THEY'RE GOOD OR BAD AND DECIDE WHETHER WE WANT TO BREAK DOWN THAT WALL OF- PROTECTION THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME. AND- YOU KNOW IT. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE KNOWN ME AND THAT THE THINGS THAT I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF A TANAMI GOES WAY BEYOND THIS ISSUE AND WE HAVE HAD OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE THE SENATE. THAT HAVE FIVE RAISE THE SAME CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS THAT I'VE DECLINED TO SUPPORT FOR THOSE REASONS. SO I AM- CONCERN THAT THAT WE'RE ACTING PREMATURELY- AND THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY GIVEN THEM THE CHANCE TO- TO MAKE CHOICES AND BY THE WAY. THAT WE DO HAVE AN ABILITY TO INFLUENCE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR RULES OF THE SENATE WE CONFIRM EVERY REGION APPOINTEE BY THE GOVERNOR. AND I I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHETHER THE REGION APPOINTEES THAT WE'VE CONFIRMED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN ASKED THESE QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS TYPE OF AN ISSUE. BECAUSE THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR US TO HAVEINPUT. INTO THEIR WORK IS TO ENSURE THAT THE APPOINTEES THE REGION'S DECISION MAKERS. KERRY FORTH OUR VALUES- AND THE VALUES THAT ARE EXPRESSED IN THIS BILL- WHICH I SUPPORT- THE- SECOND ISSUE WHICH- HAS PARTLY BEEN RAISED BY THE SENATOR FROM YUCAIPA- IS THIS QUESTION OF THAT MANY OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE NARROWLY- FOCUSED. IN AREAS THAT DON'T TOUCH. MEDICAL CARE FOR WOMEN OR TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS- NOW THE AUTHOR MADE RAP REFERENCE TO CANCER CENTER WE I GUESS THE UC PARTNERS TO. MANAGE A CANCER CENTER AND THERE COULD BE ISSUES THAT CROSS OVER- AND RAISE QUESTIONS- BUT WE ALSO. AT TWO TWENTY YEAR CAL ALSO. RADIATION ONCOLOGY TREATMENT- NEONATAL SERVICES AND SO IT CERTAINLY SEEMS THAT THERE IS. A BREATH OF THESE CONTRACTS THAT GO WAY BEYOND- THE POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE. THE TYPE OF- THE SUPPORT THAT WE ALL THAT MANY OF US FEEL- IMPORTANT- IN THE AREA OF REPRODUCTIVE AND GENDER AFFIRMING A SERVICES. FINALLY I A- WHAT IS IN THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE IS THE ISSUE OF CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS. AND RESIDENCY OPPORTUNITIES AND I DO KNOW. THAT FOR IN MANY FIELDS THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT. OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR TUDENTS TO HAVE THOSE CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS BE MET AND WE HAVE DEBATED IN VARIOUS COMMITTEES AT THE SENATE AND ON THE FLOOR THE SENATE HOW THAT IS LIMITING. ACCESS TO CARE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE TRAINED PERSONNEL WHO HAD GIVEN GET THEN PROVIDED WITH THOSE CLINICAL OPPORTUNITIES I WOULD BE ALSO INTERESTED IN HEARING- WHAT. EFFORTS CAN BE MADE OR SHOULD BE MADE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE RESTRICTED GIVEN THE STAFFING LIMITATIONS WHICH A BIG KNOWLEDGE EARLIER IN DISCUSSIONS IN THIS COMMITTEE. FINALLY I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. WE SHARE THE SAME VALUES. AS BEEN EXPRESSED AS BUT PURPOSES OF THIS BILL AND HE'S BEEN A TRUE CHAMPION- FOR THOSE VALUES AND I KNOW THIS BILL REFLECTS. HIS AT BEST OF INTENTIONS TO TRY TO ADVANCE THE GOOD THAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR STATE. I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL MOVING FORWARD TODAY BUT I HOPE THAT. THESE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE BEEN RATE I HAVE REYES WILL. STIMULATE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AND THE HEALTH COMMITTEE WHERE IT'S GOING NEXT. AND THAT CONSIDERATION- IF A BILL REALLY AS NECESSARY AND AS I SAID THE- PERSON THAT THAT BREAKING DOWN THE AUTONOMY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S NOT SOMETHING I DO VERY EASILY. BUT IF THE BILL WAS TO ADVANCE I HOPE THAT IT WOULD BE BE NARROWED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT- PLACES IN WHICH- THESE PARTNERSHIPS DON'T INTERFERE WITH THESE VALUES THAT THIS BILL TRIES TO PROTECT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER. SENATOR WIENER I HAVE NO OTHER QUESTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS SENATOR GLAZERS CONCERNS IN YOUR CLOTHES. HAPPY TWO TERRIFIC.
