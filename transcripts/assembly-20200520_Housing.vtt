HOMES. ARE NOT MOBILE THEY ARE

04:13:49.280 --> 04:13:53.084

HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AND

04:42:31.267 --> 04:42:33.002
SECURITY IN OUR STATE. WE KNOW

04:42:33.069 --> 04:42:35.138
THAT MOST COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO

AFFORD A HOME HERE CAN AFFORD

04:42:43.379 --> 04:42:43.846
HOME UNLESS THEY COME FROM

04:42:43.913 --> 04:42:46.816
SIGNIFICANT FAMILY WEALTH. WE

04:42:46.883 --> 04:42:47.750
KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE WHO POWER

04:42:47.817 --> 04:42:49.719
THIS STATE TEACHERS

04:42:49.786 --> 04:42:52.555

AFFORD TO OWN A HOME HERE IN

04:43:06.436 --> 04:43:09.939
OUR STATE. MY ARGUE THAT THIS

04:43:10.006 --> 04:43:12.008
IS AT THE MOMENT THIS ISN'T THE

04:43:12.075 --> 04:43:14.477
TIME TO ADDRESS HOUSING. BUT I

04:43:14.544 --> 04:43:20.616
STRONGLY. I DISAGREE. EXPANDED

04:43:20.683 --> 04:43:22.885
ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING

04:43:22.952 --> 04:43:24.354
MUST BE A CRITICAL PART OF OUR

04:43:24.420 --> 04:43:26.789
RECOVERY FROM THIS

04:43:26.856 --> 04:43:28.891
UNPRECEDENTED HEALTHCARE CRISIS.

04:43:28.958 --> 04:43:32.195
WE NEED TO HELP THE MILLIONS OF

04:43:32.261 --> 04:43:34.197
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING.

04:43:34.263 --> 04:43:36.332

CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE WORRIED

04:43:40.570 --> 04:43:43.873
ABOUT THEIR FUTURE. AND WE CAN

04:43:43.940 --> 04:43:46.409
DO THIS WE CAN MAKE REAL

04:43:46.476 --> 04:43:48.177
PROGRESS ON HOUSING. RATING

04:43:48.244 --> 04:43:51.013
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND WE CAN

04:43:51.080 --> 04:43:53.983
DO SO WITHOUT PUBLIC SUBSIDIES

04:43:54.050 --> 04:43:55.218
THE SUBSIDIES THAT WOULD

04:43:55.284 --> 04:43:57.186
CLEARLY PUT A FURTHER DENT IN

04:43:57.253 --> 04:43:59.489
OUR STATE BUDGET. THIS LARGEST

04:43:59.555 --> 04:44:02.125
ADDRESSES THE IMMEDIATE NEED

04:44:02.191 --> 04:44:04.927
FOR HOUSING SUPPLY AND IT DOES

04:44:04.994 --> 04:44:05.862
SO BY REMOVING BARRIERS IS

04:44:05.928 --> 04:44:08.931
STATE LAW BARRIERS THAT PREVENT

04:44:08.998 --> 04:44:10.199
THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL LOT

04:44:10.266 --> 04:44:12.935
HOMES. AND BUILDING MORE OF

04:44:13.002 --> 04:44:14.604
THESE ACTUALLY AFFORDABLE SMALL

04:44:14.670 --> 04:44:16.806
LOT HOMES PUT HOME OWNERSHIP IN

04:44:16.873 --> 04:44:18.875
REACH FOR MANY MORE

04:44:18.941 --> 04:44:22.345
CALIFORNIANS. NOT TO MENTION IT

04:44:22.412 --> 04:44:24.013
WILL GO A LONG WAY TO HAPPENED

04:44:24.080 --> 04:44:31.320
AYE VERSIFIED CAL AND STOCK. AB

04:44:31.387 --> 04:44:31.954
THREE ONE FIVE FIVE IS DESIGNED

04:44:32.021 --> 04:44:33.589
TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP

04:44:33.656 --> 04:44:35.291
FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS WHO MIGHT

04:44:35.358 --> 04:44:38.294
OTHERWISE NEVER NEVER BE ABLE

04:44:38.361 --> 04:44:39.996
TO PURCHASE A HOME IN THEIR OWN

04:44:40.062 --> 04:44:42.331
CITY. AND WITHIN OUR OWN.

04:44:42.398 --> 04:44:44.400
SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS

04:44:44.467 --> 04:44:46.002
PERMITTING FOR SMALL HOUSING

04:44:46.068 --> 04:44:47.303
DEVELOPMENTS AT TEN UNITS ARE

04:44:47.370 --> 04:44:49.906
FEWER. WHILE ENSURING THAT

04:44:49.972 --> 04:44:51.674
DEVELOPMENTS MEET ANY EXISTING

04:44:51.741 --> 04:44:54.143
LOCAL INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENTS

04:44:54.210 --> 04:44:56.345
OR ALTERNATIVELY PAY A FEE TO

04:44:56.412 --> 04:44:59.015
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONTRIBUTE

04:44:59.081 --> 04:45:00.950
TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE

04:45:01.017 --> 04:45:02.919
SMALL SCALE PROJECTS TOWN HOMES

04:45:02.985 --> 04:45:05.421
AND ROW HOUSES OFTEN FORM THE

04:45:05.488 --> 04:45:08.825
BASIS OF MUCH OFTHE AFFORDABLE

04:45:08.891 --> 04:45:10.827
HOUSING ALREADY BUSINESS IN OUR

04:45:10.893 --> 04:45:13.930
STATE. BUT THEY ARE ALL VERY

04:45:13.996 --> 04:45:16.299
VERY TOUGH TO GET APPROVED.

04:45:16.365 --> 04:45:17.700
THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THESE

04:45:17.767 --> 04:45:18.835
TYPES OF HOMES TO FOLLOW A

04:45:18.901 --> 04:45:20.269
MINISTERIAL STAFF LEVEL

04:45:20.336 --> 04:45:22.905
APPROVAL SO LONG AS THEY MEET

04:45:22.972 --> 04:45:23.806
THE OBJECTIVE RULES AND

04:45:23.873 --> 04:45:26.909
CRITERIA THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

04:45:26.976 --> 04:45:28.611
FOR EXAMPLE THESE HOMES- WOULD

04:45:28.678 --> 04:45:30.046
STILL HAVE TO FOLLOW RELEVANT

04:45:30.112 --> 04:45:32.014
LOCALS ONLY RULES AN OBJECTIVE

04:45:32.081 --> 04:45:35.284
DESIGN CRITERIA. THIS BILL

04:45:35.351 --> 04:45:36.986
WOULD ALSO EXPAND AN EXISTING

04:45:37.053 --> 04:45:39.689
EXEMPTION IN CURRENT LAW THE

04:45:39.755 --> 04:45:41.057
THIS THIS BILLS LIMITED

04:45:41.123 --> 04:45:42.892
EXPANSION OF SB THIRTY FIVE IS

04:45:42.959 --> 04:45:44.861
CRITICAL. AND IT'S CRITICAL

04:45:44.927 --> 04:45:46.496
BECAUSE REQUIRINGSMALL

04:45:46.562 --> 04:45:48.231
PROJECTS OF TEN UNITS ARE LESS

04:45:48.297 --> 04:45:50.600
TO HAVE ONSITE AFFORDABLE

HOUSING A 50% 50% THE CURRENT

04:45:53.903 --> 04:45:57.073
LAW SIMPLY IS NOT PRACTICAL.

04:45:57.139 --> 04:45:59.675
IT'S NOT PRACTICAL. BECAUSE

04:45:59.742 --> 04:46:00.943
ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN PUBLIC

04:46:01.010 --> 04:46:02.445
FUNDS FOR FORMER HOUSING GO TO

04:46:02.512 --> 04:46:05.481
LARGER PROJECTS PROJECTS WHERE

04:46:05.548 --> 04:46:06.082
THEY CAN GET THE MOST BANG FOR

04:46:06.148 --> 04:46:09.185
THEIR BUCK. WITHOUT THIS-

04:46:09.252 --> 04:46:10.620

04:46:18.594 --> 04:46:20.429
KNOW THIS BILL WILL WORK IT'LL

04:46:20.496 --> 04:46:21.631

IN FACT EARLIER TODAY WAS

06:03:01.292 --> 06:03:02.927
REFERENCE- PROJECT ROOM KEY THE

06:03:02.994 --> 06:03:05.597
STATE IS I BELIEVE ARE PURSUING

06:03:05.663 --> 06:03:08.900
CONTRACTS WITH- WITH HOTELS-

06:03:08.967 --> 06:03:10.535

06:03:32.223 --> 06:03:33.791
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS OUT THERE

06:03:33.858 --> 06:03:35.460
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE DON'T

06:03:35.527 --> 06:03:37.195
HAVE A GREAT SENSE AT ALL OF.

06:03:37.262 --> 06:03:40.165
WHAT THEY ARE AND THEIR GOALS

I CAN'T AGREE WITH YOUR

06:03:47.805 --> 06:03:49.274
ASSESSMENT THAT THINGS HAVE

06:03:49.340 --> 06:03:51.109
OVERALL BEEN WORKING EVEN THE

06:03:51.176 --> 06:03:52.911
GOVRNOR AND HIS STATE THE

06:03:52.977 --> 06:03:56.881
STATE. ADDRESS IT DOESN'T. AND

WHEN WAS SPENDING PROPOSAL.

06:04:01.753 --> 06:04:04.455
THAT NEW FOR. COULD QUICKLY.

06:04:04.522 --> 06:04:05.356
WITHOUT DEMONSTRATING MUCH

06:04:05.423 --> 06:04:07.225
PROGRESS. INVESTMENTS ARE MADE

06:04:07.292 --> 06:04:09.460
WITHOUT A CLEAR PLAN SO. I

06:04:09.527 --> 06:04:13.898
WOULD JUST YOU KNOW- URGED THAT

06:04:13.965 --> 06:04:14.532
WE THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT.

06:04:14.599 --> 06:04:15.700
WHERE THE FUNDING IS GOING

06:04:15.767 --> 06:04:16.334
BECAUSE I CAN GUARANTEE YOU IF

06:04:16.401 --> 06:04:17.969
YOU'RE DOING A BETTER JOB

06:04:18.036 --> 06:04:19.537
SPENDING THE LAST TWO POINT

06:04:19.604 --> 06:04:21.039
SEVEN BILLION IN DOING AND

06:04:21.105 --> 06:04:23.541
USING THAT. YOU KNOW THE DATA

06:04:23.608 --> 06:04:25.043

ORDER SPEND MORE ON THE THINGS

06:04:27.478 --> 06:04:28.413
THAT WORK AND SPENT MOST OF THE

06:04:28.479 --> 06:04:29.581
THINGS THAT DON'T WORK AND THAT

06:04:29.647 --> 06:04:30.582
WOULD DO A HECK OF A LOT MORE

06:04:30.648 --> 06:04:33.251
GOOD. THAN JUST THROWING TWO

06:04:33.318 --> 06:04:35.253
POINT TWO BILLION MORE DOLLARS

06:04:35.320 --> 06:04:39.691

MORE WE SHOULD BE MORE

06:05:09.721 --> 06:05:11.556
AGGRESSIVE AND IN FACT I WOULD

06:05:11.623 --> 06:05:14.092

THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOUR BILL

06:18:27.384 --> 06:18:29.553
MISTER CHAIRMAN SEEKS TO DO. IT

CLEAR THAT ACCOUNTABILITY NEED

06:18:33.991 --> 06:18:36.026
IT SHOULD ONLY BE COMMENSURATE

06:18:36.093 --> 06:18:38.729
IN A FAIR WAY WITH RESOURCES.

06:18:38.796 --> 06:18:40.397
BUT IF ANYBODY BELIEVES THAT

06:18:40.464 --> 06:18:43.801
THE CURRENT SOURCE MIX WE HAVE.

06:18:43.867 --> 06:18:45.769
BEING SPENT WITH THE MAC.

06:18:45.836 --> 06:18:47.938
AMOUNT OF URGENCY IN TERMS OF

06:18:48.005 --> 06:18:49.173
HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET MONEY

06:18:49.239 --> 06:18:51.608

JURISDICTIONS. COORDINATING OR

06:18:55.946 --> 06:18:57.981
CONSOLIDATING THE RESOURCES TO

06:18:58.048 --> 06:18:59.083
GET MORE PEOPLE OFF THE

06:18:59.149 --> 06:19:00.384
STREETS. AND THAT WE ARE

06:19:00.451 --> 06:19:02.319
FOCUSED ON THAT OBJECTIVE OF

06:19:02.386 --> 06:19:03.687
REDUCING ON SHELTERED

06:19:03.754 --> 06:19:06.323
HOMELESSNESS NOT AS AN END. BUT

06:19:06.390 --> 06:19:06.857
IS THE BEGINNING OF MOVING

06:19:06.924 --> 06:19:09.927
PEOPLE. THROUGH A CONTINUUM TO

06:19:09.993 --> 06:19:12.596
PERMANENT HOUSING. NOBODY CAN

06:19:12.663 --> 06:19:13.764
MAKE THAT CLAIM THAT WE ARE

06:19:13.831 --> 06:19:15.165
DOING THIS IN THE MOST

06:19:15.232 --> 06:19:17.034
EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE THAT'S

06:19:17.101 --> 06:19:19.536
WHERE YOU SEE THE LAWSUIT AND

06:19:19.603 --> 06:19:21.205
WHY YOU SEE. THE FRUSTRATION

06:19:21.271 --> 06:19:24.374
THIS WOULD GIVE US. EIGHT EIGHT

06:19:24.441 --> 06:19:27.778
AND ENFORCEABLE- FOCUS THAT

06:19:27.845 --> 06:19:30.114
COMBINED WITH RESOURCES I

06:19:30.180 --> 06:19:32.349
BELIEVE WOULD MOVE US TOWARDS

06:19:32.416 --> 06:19:34.384
GREATER PERCENTAGES IN NUMBERS

06:19:34.451 --> 06:19:36.353
OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY GETTING OFF

06:19:36.420 --> 06:19:38.255
THE STREET I THINK THIS IS A

06:19:38.322 --> 06:19:41.258
VITAL BILL NOT JUST TO TALK TO

06:19:41.325 --> 06:19:42.526

06:19:53.003 --> 06:19:55.139
NO LONGER LEGALLY ACCEPTABLE

06:19:55.205 --> 06:19:56.773
FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE OUTDOORS

06:19:56.840 --> 06:20:00.544

06:20:00.611 --> 06:20:02.112
TOWARDS TRYING TO HELP THEM

06:20:06.750 --> 06:20:08.585
END ISN'T GOING TO GET BETTER

06:20:08.652 --> 06:20:11.021

OR MORE YEARS OLDER THIS

06:38:42.632 --> 06:38:43.899
SUGGESTS A RIFLE SHOT THE NEXT

06:38:43.966 --> 06:38:45.534
BUSINESS DAY. ESTABLISHED AND

06:38:45.601 --> 06:38:47.570
COHESIVE NEIGHBORHOODS. WHEN I

06:38:47.637 --> 06:38:48.504
WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS

06:38:48.571 --> 06:38:50.039
TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT ON THE

06:38:50.106 --> 06:38:51.107
NEIGHBORHOOD BLOCK WITH YOUR

06:38:51.173 --> 06:38:51.707

OUT. AND REPLACED BY A LARGER

06:38:54.176 --> 06:38:56.112
BOTHERED BUT THE FAMILY ABOUT

06:38:56.178 --> 06:38:59.148
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD

06:38:59.215 --> 06:39:00.149
DO WHAT. WE DO. THE COROLLARY

06:39:00.216 --> 06:39:01.217
IS THE PROBLEM IS THE BILL'S

06:39:01.284 --> 06:39:02.585
BACK AFFORDABILITY

06:39:02.652 --> 06:39:04.820

MODERATE INCOME REQUIREMENTS

06:39:07.723 --> 06:39:09.392
YOU'RE SKIRTED. SO AGAIN THAT'S

06:39:09.458 --> 06:39:11.160
ANOTHER WAY TO DISPEL WHAT I

06:39:11.227 --> 06:39:11.627
THINK UNINTENTIONALLY

06:39:11.694 --> 06:39:14.163

LAST POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS

06:39:19.201 --> 06:39:20.069
I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO

06:39:20.136 --> 06:39:21.470
CONSIDER THAT THE NEIGHBORHOODS

06:39:21.537 --> 06:39:22.471

06:39:22.538 --> 06:39:24.507

06:42:02.865 --> 06:42:03.699
RESPONSE TO THE OPPOSITION

06:42:03.766 --> 06:42:05.634
FIRST OF ALL- THE IDEA THAT

06:42:05.701 --> 06:42:08.070
THISIS A MANDATE IS SIMPLY NOT

06:42:08.137 --> 06:42:11.373
TRUE- AND IN FACT- I WOULD SAY

06:42:11.440 --> 06:42:12.408
I DON'T THINK THAT- SEE

06:42:12.475 --> 06:42:14.376

FURTHER THAN THE TRUTH- I WANT

06:42:30.626 --> 06:42:32.127
