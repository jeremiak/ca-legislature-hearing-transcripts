CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATIONS IN THE NATION ETHNIC MINORITIES ACCOUNT FOR OVER 71% OFTHE STUDENT POPULATION WITH MORE THAN NINETY LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN DISTRICT SCHOOLS SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY POP PROUD OF. AS CIVIL UNREST AND RACIAL TENSIONS HAVE RISEN ACROSS THE NATION CALIFORNIA'S PRIDES ITSELF AS BEING A PROGRESSIVE BEACON. WORKING THE CHART A MORE EQUITABLE FUTURE IN ORDER TO BUILD RACIAL JUSTICE IN THE STATE AND COUNTRY OUR STUDENTS NEED TO LEARN A MORE INCLUSIVE HISTORY OF AMERICA AND THAT HISTORY INCLUDES A DIVERSE EXPERIENCES AND PERSPECTIVES. OF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS SINCE ETHNIC STUDIES WAS ESTABLISHED AS AN ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE HE HAD DECADES OF SCHOLARSHIP AND ACTIVISM. UP DESPITE THAT ETHNIC STUDIES HAS NOT BEEN UNIFORMLY INTEGRATED INTO K. THROUGH TWELVE CLASSROOMS. WILL ETHNIC STUDIES AWAITS STATE WIDE ADOPTION DOZENS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING SOME OF THE STATE'S LARGEST HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO OFFER THESE IMPORTANT CLASSES. STUDENTS TEACHERS AND PARENTS HAVE COME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAMS IT'S TIME THAT OUR STATE JOIN THEM AS WELL IN MARCH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION APPROVES THE MODEL CURRICULUM FOR ETHNIC STUDIES. THE FIVE DIVERSE CAUCUSES HAVE WORKED FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEY STAND TOGETHER AND SUPPORT A B. ONE ONE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE VET CENTER PAT. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SENATORS I AS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I TO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ONE OH ONE ONE RECOGNIZE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE AUTHOR SO THERE HAS BEEN DENIED AND BRING TOGETHER AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT AMONG THE FIVE. PERCY KAKISSIS ETHNIC STUDIES IS IMPORTANT TO THE EDUCATION OF OUR YOUTH EXACTLY THAT'S WHEN I PUT. THANK YOUS CENTER WINNER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT I RISE PERSONALLY BUT ALSO AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS I WANNA- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ONE OR ONE ON ONE I THANK THE AUTHOR OF MR MEDINA AS WELL AS THE LATINO BLACK AND API CARCASSES AFTER WORKING VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THE JEWISH CAUCUS REALLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS- AND FOR WORKING VERY VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PUBLISHING THE- IMPORTANT SHARED GOAL OF. OF HAVING I THINK SAUDIS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AT ALL OF OUR CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO LEARN- NOT JUST ABOUT- A WHITEWASH HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY- BUT THE ACTUAL LIVED EXPERIENCES. OF SO MANY PEOPLE PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHICH HAS SO FREQUENTLY BEEN SIMPLY ERASED- FROM- FROM AMERICAN HISTORY HI SIR THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS YOU MAY KNOW THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE I THINK STUDIES PROPOSED DRAFT CURRICULUM PROPOSED BY THE ICC HAS SOME VERY VERY PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS THAT WERE FRANKLY ANTI SEMITIC. WE WORKED VERY VERY HARDAND I THINK I CAN SEE OF THE CENTER FROM SANTA MONICA IN PARTICULAR- AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS NOT A PART OF THE CURRICULUM THE CURRICULUM WOULD NOT BE TEACHING ANTI SEMITISM OR ANY FORM OF HATE AND THE FINAL VERSION WAS A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT AND SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE ALL RALLIED AROUND- AND DEFENDED I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INCLUDING- IN THE LEGISLATION- WHEN I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM PASADENA FOR WORKING. WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD STRONG GUARDRAILS SIGNS LEGISLATION THEY'RE VERY STRONG GUARDRAILS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE'RE TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES WE'RE NOT GOING TO TEACH ANTI. SEMITISM OR ANY OTHER FORM OF HE- I WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A BACK DOOR WERE PEOPLE CAN. I GO TO LOCALS THIS. AND TRY TO THE VERSION THE REJECTED DRAFTS VERSION SOMEHOW BACK TOWARD AND- THIS LEGISLATION WILL PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING- AND SO I. RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND ASPIRIN I WILL. CUSE CENTER LAMONT. THANK YOU MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE EIGHTY ONE OH ONE AND IT HAS BEEN UNDOUBTEDLY INCREDIBLE EFFORT ON FOR DECADES I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A BILL HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS- WHEN I GOT ON TO THE SCHOOL BOARD TEN YEARS AGO- Z. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE DO TO HAVE ETHNIC STUDIES- AT THE TIME IT WAS ETHNIC STUDIES AS AN ELECTIVE. AND VERY OFTEN THE CONVERSATION HAVE A WELL HOW DO YOU MEASURE ACADEMIC SUCCESS- WHAT KINDS OF ELEMENTS DO YOU PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE- THE ETHNIC STUDIES IS MEETING BOTH THE OBJECTIVE IN AN ACADEMIC WAY AND IN OTHER WAYS AND WHAT WE FOUND- FOR SANTA BARBARA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH DOES HAVE THIS AS A HIGH SCHOOL REQUIREMENT IN PLACE- IT IS THAT THERE WERE MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES AND SOMETIMES OUR TRADITIONAL MEANS. TO ASSESS WE'RE NOT THERE- AND WE HAD TO FIND WAYS TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY ALL OF OUR STUDENT COMMUNITY FELT INCLUDED IN A HISTORY TOLD IN THE CLASSROOMS AND I THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY WHAT IS- IN FRONT OF US- AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR IT IS SIMPLY CALLING FROM RIVERSIDE BUT ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE- TOO MANY TO NAME WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MAKING SURE. THAT THIS IS SHAPED IN A WAY THAT DOES RIGHT FOR THE STUDENT- BUT ALSO DOES RIGHT FOR THE CONVERSATIONS THAT FOLLOW ABOUT WHAT IT WHAT IT'S LIKE ESPECIALLY TO LIVE IN AN INCLUSIVE- AND VERY DIVERSE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT AND THANKS TO THE CHAIRS AND VICE CHAIRS OF ALL OF OUR CAUCUSES WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING THIS SO I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT I'M WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT THE VOTE TO DATE HAS BEEN DECADES. IN THE MAKING FOR THE STATE. THANK YOU SENATOR I'LL- THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I WANT TO ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN STATED- WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY HOPEFUL THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO A AN INCLUSIVE CURRICULUM ONE THAT GIVES INSPIRATION TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF CALIFORNIA% STUDENTS TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT AMERICAN HISTORY- AND ALSO TO LEARN DIFFERENT STORIES NEWS STORIES- STORIES BUT OF COURSE THEY'RE ONLY KNEW IN THE CURRICULUM BUT THEY'RE OLD STORIES OFTEN TIMES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER TOLD. ABOUT STRUGGLES AND CHALLENGES THAT SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE FACED OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SUN THIS IS A I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR STATE. AS WE AS WE LEARN TO LIVE AND THRIVE TOGETHER IN A IN A TRULY PLURALISTIC SOCIETY. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. I WANTED JUST A CLOSE ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND- ONE OF THE REASONS WHY FOLKS IN. JEWISH COMMUNITY ARE MEETING COMMUNITY- SOME SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITIES THAT SECTOR WHERE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ORIGINAL DRAFT- INCLUSION ISSUES AND THEN AND IN A COUPLE CASES SOME SOME OUT RIGHT- DISCRIMINATORY CONTENT. IN IN THE IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THIS BILL. CONTAINS A SPECIAL GUARD RAILS TO PROTECT. AGAINST DISCRIMINATORY CONTENT. SO THAT WE REALLY CAN. SURE THIS IS GOING TO BE A COURSE IT'S GONNA GONNA CONNECT TO TEACH OUR KIDS TO. HERE O LIVE IN AND THRIVE IN A TRULY TRULY PLURALISTIC SOCIETY THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER STORIES AND CULTURES- AND THEN TO LIVE AND GROW AND THRIVE TOGETHER. AND SO. I HAVE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION AS WAS MENTIONED WORKED SO HARD TO NOT COME TO A DRAFT MODEL CURRICULUM. THAT MET THOSE GOALS- IT'S WHAT WE'RE CERTAINLY HOPING FOR WITH THIS COURSE. AND WITH ALL OF THAT WORK HAVING BEEN DONE AND ALL THE WORK OF THE ACTIVISTS OVER SO MANY YEARS- I WILL I STIR I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MEANT. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I'M PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCE WHEN I GREW UP HERE IN CALIFORNIA- THERE WERE NOT A LOT OF ASIAN AMERICANS AND I WENT TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH AND THERE WERE NO KOREAN AMERICANS UNTIL MAYBE I WAS IN FIFTH GRADE- NOBODY REALLY KNEW MUCH ABOUT. IT THE ASIAN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE- NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT KOREA. AND IT REALLY WASN'T UNTIL COLLEGE AND BEYOND. THAT I LEARNED WHY THEY WERE SPAT POSSIBLY OF ASIAN AMERICANS IN THIS STATE IN THIS COUNTRY. ABOUT SOME OF THE ANTI ASIAN IMMIGRATION STATUTES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND- PREVENTED ASIAN AMERICANS FROM IMMIGRATING HERE UNTIL. NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE OR LATER. AND IT'S NOT MY EXPERIENCE UNFORTUNATELY. IS NOT UNIQUE AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S NOT YOU NEED TODAY IF THERE ARE. MANY MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE FIRST GENERATION SECOND GENERATION THIRD GENERATION AMERICANS. WHO DON'T EXPERIENCE OUR OWN CULTURE THEY'RE NOT TAUGHT ABOUT THEIR CULTURES ARE NOT TAUGHT ABOUT. THE EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE LIKE THEM. NOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT WHAT ETHNIC STUDIES DOES AND IT IS- BYE I THINK WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A THOUGHTFUL PROCESS AND I WANT TO CONGRATULATE AND LAW THE AUTHORS OF THIS BILL. BECAUSE THEY WENT THROUGH A THOUGHTFUL PROCESS TO TRY TO INOCULATE THIS BILL FROM SOME OF THE CRITICISMS- WHICH WERE SO MISGUIDED THIS IS NOT AN ANTI WHITE BILL. IT'S NOT AN ANTI AMERICAN BILL IT'S A BILL THAT TRIES TO TEACH A BALANCED HISTORY OF WHAT AMERICA IS REALLY ABOUT AND WE KNOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION MAKE OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY STRONGER BUT FOR THAT TO REALLY WORK WE HAVE TO START TEACHING. A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE CURRICULUM AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I. BILL BECAUSE THIS IS CRITICAL FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO- YOU KNOW COUPLE WHOSE PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS COME HERE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES AND THEY'RE- OFF FOR BEARS CULTURAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS COUNTRY. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER. DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THE SITE ON SCENE NINE SENATOR. OUT SENATOR CAMPBELL OUR COPIER WHICH- THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I JUST WANT TO ADD MY VOICE OF THANKS TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS DISK THESE KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HISTORY AND ABOUT. THE DETAILS OF HISTORY ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND FRANKLY MOST OF US. I GREW UP HAVING NO CONTEXT IN WHICH TO UNDERSTAND OUR OWN IMMIGRATION EXPERIENCES COMING TO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE WE ALL ARE IMMIGRANTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NATIVE AMERICANS WHO. WHO CAME HERE WAY BEFORE EVERYBODY ELSE AND THAT LACK OF INFORMATION REALLY HURTS US AND IT IT HURTS US IN WAYS THAT. THIS BILL CAN HELP TO RESOLVE SOMEWHERE I REALLY WANNA RECOGNIZE AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR LISTENING CAREFULLY TO THE OPPOSITION THAT HAD SOME REALLY VALID ISSUES AND FOR TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND WORKING. GENTLY TO CREATE THE BEST BILL POSSIBLE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EYE BUT TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR MELINDA US. THANK YOU- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THERE'S BEEN MUCH IN THE NEWS ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES AS IT IS COUPLED WITH CRITICAL RACE THEORY WHICH IS REALLY WHAT PARENTS ACROSS THIS NATION ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT. AND THOSE WHO TEACH CRITICAL RACE THEORY HAVE- STATED PUBLICLY THAT ETHNIC STUDIES AND CRITICAL RACE THEORY GO HAND IN HAND THAT THEY GO TOGETHER. AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY YOU'VE SEEN SO MANY SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS ACROSS THE STATE AND THIS NATION WHERE PARENTS ARE UP IN ARMS ABOUT THIS TYPE OF IDEOLOGY BEING TAUGHT TO THEIR CHILDREN. I THINK THERE ARE CERTAINLY MANY MEMBERS OF THIS BODY WHO HAVE THEIR IDEA OF WHAT IT IS TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES AND THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY BENIGN. THAT WE'RE JUST TEACHING- CULTURAL HISTORY AND IT'S SOMETHING TO BE LAUDED BUT IF YOU DIG DEEPER INTO WHAT CRITICAL RACE THEORY TEACHERS ARE YOUNG PEOPLE I THINK HE WOULD- PERHAPS THINK OTHERWISE. AS AN EXAMPLE IN CUPERTINO CALIFORNIA- IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL- LET'S SEE WAS THIRD GRADERS WERE REQUIRED TO DECONSTRUCT THEIR RACIAL AND SEXUAL IDENTITIES. THEN RANK THEMSELVES ACCORDING TO THEIR POWER AND PRIVILEGE- IN MISSOURI TEACHERS IN DIVERSITY TRAINING. WERE REQUIRED TO LOCATE THEMSELVES ON THE OPPRESSION MATRIX IN NEW YORK. THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL SENT PARENTS LITERATURE INCLUDING TOOLS FOR ACTION AND TOUTING WHITE TRADERS AND ADVOCATING FOR FULL WHITE ABOLITION. PORTLAND OREGON- THEY ARE TAUGHT TO DEVELOP AND IDENTIFY THEIR- WHITE IDENTITY AND HOW THEY HAVE. TAKEN PART IN OPPRESSING OTHERS THIS IS NOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE TEACHING OUR CHILDREN- AND I WILL REMIND YOU THAT IF I CAN FIND THE QUOTE HERE- ABRAM CANDY WHO HAS WRITTEN A BOOK. A RELATING TO CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND IS REALLY- THE SPOKESMAN FOR THIS EFFORT HIS WORDS. WERE THE ONLY REMEDY TO PRESENT TO DISCRIMINATION IS FUTURE DISCRIMINATION. I DON'T THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO BE TEACHING OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR KIDS AREN'T BORN. HATING OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE THEY ARE TIED TO THAT N THE LAST THING WE NEED IS STATE SANCTIONED. RACISM BEING TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS- AGAIN YOU CAN WE CAN TALK FOR HOURS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF TEACHING OUR KIDS ABOUT THEIR HISTORY AND THE CULTURE AND WHAT FORM OF THIS GREAT NATION BUT TO TEACH THEM TO HATE ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE IS ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLE I WOULD. URGE YOUR NO VOTE. COME OVER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AS A VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE OH ONE AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE TRI ETHNIC CAUCUSES FOR- REALLY LEANING IN. AND HAVING SOME REAL. UNCOMFORTABLE HONEST DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS BILL. AND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH YOU KNOW MANY OF US. HAVE CULTURAL LEGENDS I CONS THAT WE WISH HAD BEEN TAUGHT THROUGH THE MAINSTREAM EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS IF FOR NO OTHER REASON. THEN. REALLY TO BE CHANNELED THROUGH ONE. REAL PIPELINE OF EDUCATION. AND IN THE COURSE OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO LEARN THE ABC'S AND ONE TWO THREES. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THEY ARE. IN THE CONTEXT. OF UNITED STATES AMERICAN HISTORY. AND HOW THAT FEELS WHEN YOU ARE EITHER ARE RAISED FROM. MARGINALIZED BY. OR PUT IT THE INOTES OTHER PARTICULAR HISTORY BOOK OR LESSEN. AND THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO RECTIFY THAT. IN THE COURSE OF THIS SIZE. THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND EIGHTY ONE OH ONE I ACTUALLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A COLLEAGUE AND I SAID. I RECOUNTED THE TIME WHEN- I WAS IN ISRAEL HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PEACE NEGOTIATOR AND ASKED IF THERE WOULD EVER BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE PERSON SAID NOW. AS LONG AS- EITHER SIDE REFUSES TO RECOGNIZE THE OTHER SIDE'S TRAUMA. WE WILL NEVER GET TO A PLACE OF PEACE. AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE TRY TO ACCOMPLISH WITH EIGHTY ONE OH ONE. RECOGNIZING THE TRAUMAS OF ALL OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE INTEGRAL OR WHOSE STORIES ARE INTEGRAL TO WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ALLOW IT TO BE SHARED TWO YOUNG FOLKS. IN A WAY THAT IS HONEST. YOU KNOW. THE REALITY IS THAT IT IS AS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS BEING TAUGHT AS IT IS TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS AROUND WHO IS TEACHING IT AND HOW THAT WILL BE TALKED. THIS IS NOT GONNA IN CULTURE WARS. BUT THIS IS ALSO NOT ABOUT. IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT RACE IT'S ABOUT HISTORY AND THE FACT THAT FOR SO LONG SO MANY PARTS OF OUR UNITED STATES AMERICAN HISTORY HAS BEEN PUSHED TO THE SIDELINES. AND TALKING ABOUT RACE CAN BE DONE. WITHOUT SHAMING PEOPLE. WITHOUT BEING ACCUSATORY AND WITHOUT BEING DIVISIVE. AND IF FOLKS ARE SO AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT RACE. THEN I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO LEAN DEEPER IN BECAUSE YOU'VE PROBABLY TOUCHED ON A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE VULNERABLE POINTS. AND WHO YOU ARE. THAT NEEDS TO BE FURTHER DISSECTED. I EIGHTY ONE OH ONE AND IS ABOUT ASKING FOLKS TO TAKE THE BLINDERS OFF WE SHOULDN'T BE WHITEWASHING HISTORY SO THAT IT'S- BIAR. THROUGH THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THIS EXISTENCE OF THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN. AND LEARNING THAT DOESN'T CREATE DIVISION. HOPEFULLY IT CREATES OPPORTUNITY FOR REFLECTION. A NEW WAYS OF TALKING ABOUT FOLKS AND HISTORIES THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT BUT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO STOP BEING AFRAID. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. AND I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN YOUNG PEOPLE HAVING ALL OF THE INFORMATION AT THEIR DISPOSAL. ABOUT HOW THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ABOUT WHO HELPED TO MAKE IT GREAT. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO SPEND ALL OF OUR TIMES DURING THESE COMMEMORATIVE DAYS WITH OUR FLOOR SPEECHES TALKING ABOUT FOLKS. THEY'RE NOT TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS. SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ONE OH ONE. BECAUSE THESE INCREMENTAL STEPS TOWARDS HONESTY. ARE THE STEPS THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKING. WITH SOME MORE FORCEFULNESS AND SOME MORE CONFIDENCE. SO THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I'D ASK FOR AN IDOL FOR EIGHTY ONE OH ONE THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ONE A ONE AND I MOSTLY WANT TO THINK- THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA FOR HIS DOG AND WORK ON THIS ISSUE. EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE US SENATE- BEFORE WAS THE CHAIRPERSON EDUCATION I SET ON SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND HE'S ALWAYS BROUGHT THE BILL FORWARD I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED IT AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID THE SAME THING. THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER THE MORE WE WILL REALIZE THAT WE ARE MORE ALIKE THAN WE ARE DIFFERENT. I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT CULTURES I WANT MY CHILDREN TO LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT CULTURES I WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS ALSO WITH. SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES THAT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT GOING FORWARD THIS IS ALSO ABOUT LEARNING OUR HISTORY OUR TRUE HISTORY SO ABOUT HATING ANYONE IT'S NOT ABOUT HATING WHITE PEOPLE IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING OUR TRUE HISTORY. AND WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CRITICAL RACE THEORY WHICH JUST AS AN ASIDE IS NOT PART OF A B. ONE OH ONE AND IS NOT PART OF ETHNIC STUDIES THE DEFINITION OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS A BODY OF LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP. AND ACADEMIC MOVEMENT OF US CIVIL RIGHTS SCHOLARS AND ACTIVISTS WHO SEEK TO CRITICALLY EXAMINE THE INTERSECTIONAL INTERSECTION OF RACE AND US LAW. AND TO CHALLENGE MAINSTREAM AMERICAN LIBERAL APPROACHES TO RACIAL JUSTICE C. R. T. EXAMINE SOCIAL SOCIAL CULTURAL AND LEGAL ISSUES PRIMARILY AS A RESULT RESULT RELATE TO RACE AND RACISM IN THE US. THE BASIC TENANTS OF C. R. T. INCLUDE THAT RACISM AND DESPAIR RACIAL OUTCOMES ARE THE RESULT OF COMPLEX CHANGING AND OFTEN SUBTLE SOCIAL IN INSTITUTIONAL DYNAMICS RATHER THAN. INTERNAL INTERNAL INTERNAL INTENTIONAL EXCUSE ME PREJUDICES IN INDIVIDUALS SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S A BAD THING SOMETIMES RACISM IS. SUBTLE SOMETIMES WE DON'T KNOW IT I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M NOT BEHAVING IN A MANNER THAT WOULD OFFEND SOMEONE. AND I DO AGREE. CHILDREN ARE NOT BORN RACIST THAT'S A 100% CORRECT. BUT CHILDREN DO LIVE WITH RACIST PARENTS SOMETIMES IF THEY DON'T LEARN SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN SCHOOL THEY WILL LEARN TO BE RACIST I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT. AGAIN I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE MEMBER MEDINA FOR HIS DOG AND WORK ON THIS AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL SEE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND GET SIGNED I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WAY SO. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THIS DEBATE AND- I JUST WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF THE- ISSUE OF SCIENCE BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY ABOUT EDUCATION. AND THE WAY WE PERCEIVE SCIENCE AND YOUTH I'M GLAD THAT. CRITICAL RACE THEORY WASN'T WRITTEN TO THE BUILDING OF SOMEBODY RISES UP AND SAY THIS IS ABOUT CRITICAL RACE THEORY THERE THEY DIDN'T READ THE BILL. AND YOU HAVE TO ALSO UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS THAT AS- ACTUALLY ONE THEORY IN SCIENCE THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS AND IF. YOU KNOW ABOUT SCIENCE YOU KNOW THAT SCIENCE IS ALWAYS ALWAYS WORKS ON CHALLENGING. OUR OWN UNDERSTANDING IT'S A CONSTANT CHALLENGE OF THE WAY WE VIEW OF THE WORLD AND THE WAY WE'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND THINGS AND IF YOU. TAKE A POSITION IN SCIENCE AT THINGS ARE CERTAIN WAYS YOU'LL PROBABLY. BE IN B. THE- WRONG IN TERMS OF HOW HOW WE WOULD VIEW. SOCIETY IN THE WORLD. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE- INCLUDING EDUCATION IN EVERY ASPECT OF RAISING OUR CHILDREN PREPARING THEM FROM THE WORLD WE HAVE TO. RAISE PEOPLE THAT- ARE ARE PROUD OF WHO THEY ARE ON THE ONE HAND AND ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE THAT ARE GROUNDED. IN ROME AND- IN KNOWING HOW TO INVESTIGATE THINGS TO THE SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES THAT ALLOW OUR CURRENT OUR OUR WORLD TO FLOURISH AND DEVELOP IN THE LAST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS. SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A NATION OF PEOPLE WHOSE HEADS ARE IN THE SAND. IF YOU REALLY WILL CHALLENGE. THE PROSPERITY AND THE POSITION OF OUR COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. IN A IN A IN A VERY MAJOR. EXTENT SO DON'T BE AFRAID OF EDUCATION DON'T BE AFRAID OF UNDERSTANDING OTHER PEOPLE I GOT A CATHOLIC EDUCATION GROWING UP AND ONE OF THE THINGS MY SCHOOL DID MY CATHOLIC SCHOOL DID WAS TAKE ME TO LEARN. WE WENT TO A WELCOME TO MOSCOW WE WENT TO A SYNAGOGUE WE WENT TO A BUDDHIST TEMPLE AS PART OF OUR RELIGIOUS EDUCATION AND IT WAS EXTREMELY. REVEALING TO ME AND IT WAS JUST A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND OTHER PEOPLE I COME TO RESPECT THEM. AND THAT WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE IN MY YOUTH WHY WHY COULDN'T WE NOT ALLOW THAT TO EVERYBODY. IN OUR COUNTRY IN SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS THAT INCLUDE. ETHNICITY RELIGION HISTORY JUSTIN SO MANY PARTS OF OUR OUR SOCIETY DON'T BE AFRAID. TO EDUCATE YOUR CHILDREN. I'M NOT AFRAID TO EDUCATE MINE AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING TO A VERY COMPLEX WORLD. TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE THAT WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THEIR ABILITIES. TO NOT ONLY SURVIVE BUT TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN A COMPLEX WORLD. I SUPPORT P. B. ONE A ONE I THINK WE SHOULD AS A LEGISLATURE LET'S. MOVE IT FORWARD AND IMPROVE OUR SCHOOLS IMPROVE OUR QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND CONTINUE TO HAVE CALIFORNIA BE A LEADER IN THE WORLD. IN ALL THE AREAS THAT MATTER MOST. Q. SENATOR GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I TOO WANT TO THANK HIM AND MY- CAN YOU CONGRADULATIONS IF THIS SHOULD MOVE OFF THE FLOOR BUT MOSTLY MY THANKS TO THE CARCASSES THAT PUT IN SOME REALLY HARD WORK HERE- AGAIN BEING A PARENT OF A FIRST GRADER MY CHILD IS JUST SENT HOME EVEN BEFORE- THEY SHOULD PASS WITH THREE BOOKS A BOOK ABOUT A MUSLIM CHILDREN A BOOK ABOUT BLACK FAMILIES A BOOK ABOUT BROWN OF FAMILIES THE LATINO NATIVE EXPERIENCE WHICH IS PRETTY COOL IT'S NOT JUST TO SAY THAT- STUDENTS OR THE LEGISLATURES PUSHING SOMETHING TEACHERS WANT TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT. IT'S NOT THE IDEOLOGIES OR SYSTEM OF IDEAS THAT SOME PEOPLE SHOULD THINK IT'S LIVED EXPERIENCES OF THE PEOPLE- THAT HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THIS THIS COUNTRY IN THIS STATE FOR SO LONG LIVED EXPERIENCES IS WHAT WE NEED TO PUT OUT FIRST I'M WITH THE FIFTH LARGEST EONOMY- AND WE NEED TO SEE- OURSELVES IN THESE BOOKS THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THERE'S BEEN STUDIES OUT THERE IS MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S A LEAD TO STUDENTS HAVING HIGHER ATTENDANCE HIGHER GRADUATION RATES AND HIGHER INCREASED ENROLLMENT. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT THEMSELVES WHITE CHILDREN WANT TO LEARN ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO START CHANGING OF THE ROADMAP AS IT PERTAINS TO A RACIAL EQUITY AND SOCIAL EQUITY IN UPWARD MOBILITY FOR THEIR FRIENDS AND SO FOR THAT I FEEL SO STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ONE OF ONE AND I WANT TO THINK ABOUT ARE MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. ON BEHALF OF THE SET BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU SOONER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I ALSO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ONE OH ONE AND WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR HI THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE A WHILE AND I WAS PRIVILEGED ENOUGH TO SIT ON SO MANY OTHER CAUCUSES WERE HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS. ARE INTERESTING ENOUGH IF WE STARTED WITH DIVERSE VIEWS AND DIFFERENT OPINIONS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY EVERYONE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND EVERYONE CAME TO THE TABLE AND AGREED THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE- I WANT TO BORROW A LINE FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AND SHE SAID. HI THIS IS ABOUT TAKING STEPS INCREMENTAL STEPS TOWARDS HONESTY AND I AGREED THIS IS NOT ABOUT CREATING A TRUTH IT'S ABOUT JUST TELLING THE TRUTH AND AS A FORMER TEACHER WHO TAUGHT HISTORY IT DOES MAKE ME SAD TO SEE THAT SO MUCH THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ARE YOU SCORING UP TODAY IS LEFT OUT OF HISTORY BOOKS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE GONNA TEACH HISTORY WE CANNOT LEAVE FAX OUT OF HISTORY WE HAVE TO TELL. THE TRUTH ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF SO MANY OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES FROM YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED AND PERHAPS YOU MAY NOT BE THE BEST OF OUR HISTORY BUT WITHOUT OUR HISTORY THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE CAN IMPROVE IN THE FUTURE SO WITH THAT I ALSO URGE YOUR RIVAL.

ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BERM BERMAN AN ACT RELATING TO AIR POLLUTION SENATOR GONZALES THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BERMAN AND GONZALES TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX WHICH WILL PHASE IN. THEIR EMISSION STANDARDS FOR SMALL OFF ROAD ENGINES LIKE LEAF BLOWERS AND LAWN MOWERS CURRENTLY SMALL GAS POWERED ENGINES ARE STORES OF THEIR CALL OUR MAJOR SOURCE OF POLLUTION IN FACT EMISSIONS FROM SMALL ENGINES ACTUALLY SURPASSED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MISSIONS FROM ALL PASSENGER CARS IN CALIFORNIA JUST THIS YEAR- AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX WOULD PHASE IN A ZERO EMISSION STANDARD FOR SALES OF NEW SMALL ENGINES BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WITH THE DELAYED PHASE AND- BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT FOR SMALL PORTABLE GENERATORS. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS ALREADY BEGUN THE RULE MAKING PROCESS ON THIS ISSUE IN THE BILL IS IN LINE WITH THEIR PROPOSAL FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT STANDARD. AT THIS BILL DOES NOT AFFECT THE USE OF EXISTING SMALL ENGINES AND HAS IMPORTANT EXEMPTIONS FOR FARM EQUIPMENT AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE ENTITIES FURTHERMORE I TWO INCH INSURED JUST TRANSITION THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HAVE SECURED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET TO CREATE A DEDICATED INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR SMALL LANDSCAPING BUSINESSES. TO TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR PRIVACY. THANK YOU FOR THIS. OF THE IT ON THIS O. SENATOR DALLAS. THANK YOU ADAM. FOR THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS- I DON'T SOLVE THIS BILL AND- LEE WAS EQ AND- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WE'RE GONNA REGULATE. A LAWN MOWER WEEDEATER A CHAIN SAW A GENERATOR. AND I KNOW IT'S PHASED IN OVER TIME IN THOSE OF US WHO ARE WANT TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR LAND FROM FIRE AND- HEY WHAT WE'LL GO BY SIMON ME THEY'LL LAST AND THEN THE NEXT GENERATION WON'T HAPPEN. AND IT'S JUST AMAZING TO ME THAT WE PASS LEGISLATION LIKE THIS THAT REGULATES FREEDOM OF PEOPLE TO USE SOMETHING OTHER THAN A BATTERY. WHEN THE POWER'S OUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO POT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CHARGE YOUR BATTERY. SO THAT YOU CAN. SUPPOSEDLY KEEP YOUR REFRIGERATOR ON. WHAT HAPPENED PUBLIC POWER SAFETY SHUT OFFS ALMOST EVERY YEAR NOW. AND WE'RE CONVERTING EVERYTHING TO POWER BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON THIS LEGISLATURE HATES. FUEL WHICH IS VERY SUSTAINABLE IT'S EASY TO ACCESS AND WHEN THE POWER IS OFF YOU CAN STILL USE IT YOU CAN STILL RUN A GENERATOR TO KEEP YOUR FEES ARE GOING TO KEEP YOUR MEDICAL DEVICES GOING BUT WHEN YOUR BATTERY IS DEAD AND THERE'S NO POWER ON YOU HAVE. NOTHING. AND ON TOP OF THAT. WE TALK ABOUT SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT THIS IS THIS IS A JOKE ABOUT SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT YOU WANT TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT TAKE THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HELP SOMEBODY STAY IN THE WEEDING LAWN MOWING BUSINESS. AND SPEND IT ON THE FIRST THAT'S BURNING THE HECK DOWN AS WE SPEAK RIGHT THIS MINUTE EMITTING MORE CARBON THAN ALL THE BILLS YOU'VE EVER DONE IN THIS LEGISLATURE. TOGETHER. I'M I'M SORRY I'M YELLING. I'M A LITTLE BIT. FRUSTRATED AT THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE COMMON SENSE IN THIS PLACE. THAT WE CAN BURN ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE REGULATE. COMBUSTIBLE ENGINES COME ON REALLY THIS IS AS GOOD AS WE CAN DO AND THEN LAST NIGHT. IN THE BUDGET HEARING. WE'RE NOT EVEN GONNA SPEND MONEY ON PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOVEL READY SEEKER READY PROJECTS TO MAKE OUR FIRES KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES MORE FIRE SAFE. MEMBERS AT SOME POINT THE PUBLIC IS GONNA WAKE UP AND REALIZE THAT ALL THE MONEY WE SPEND ON BATTERIES SOLAR PANELS. REGULATING COMBUSTION ENGINE ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS BILL IS GOING TO DO NOTHING TO SAVE THIS PLANET OTHER THAN REGULATES OUR BODY TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT VOTING FOR THIS BILL. AND IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE THE OUTCOME IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE. CALIFORNIA AND YOU WANT TO SAVE OUR WATERSHEDS OUR WILDLIFE. OUR CARBON SEEK FOREST IS THE PLACE WERE WE SEQUESTER CARBON IF IT'S STILL ALIVE. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE KILL THIS BILL AND DO SOMETHING THAT REALLY MAKES CALIFORNIA RIGHT BY DOING SOMETHING THAT WOULD STOP. THE MASSIVE. THE SPEWING OF CARBON WHICH IS FOREST FIRE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN. AND THANK YOU- IS PRESENT MEMBERS- THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE BOARD IS ALREADY WORKING ON RULE MAKING AROUND THIS AREA AND- AND THESE REGULATIONS COVER A BROAD RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING PORTABLE GENERATORS LAWN AND GARDEN EQUIPMENT CHAINSAWS PUMPS. AND OTHER DEVICES MY UNDIES WITH THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE SPECIFIC SUB CATEGORY OF PORTABLE GENERATORS DURING P. S. P. S. EVENTS THE DISASTERS AND OTHER POWER INTERRUPTIONS MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE COME TO RELY ON PORTABLE GENERATORS TO POWER MEDICAL EQUIPMENT REFRIGERATORS AIR CONDITIONING OTHER ESSENTIAL POWER NEEDS DURING THESE INTERNMENT CHALLENGES WHICH HAVE BECOME ALL TOO. FREQUENT IN RECENT DAYS REGULATION IT WILL HAMPER ACCESS TO THIS EQUIPMENT- IS A SIGNIFICANT TURN FOR NOT ONLY THESE CONSTITUENTS- BUT FIRMER FOR FIRST RESPONDERS WHO TRY TO MEET THEIR NEEDS IN CRISIS THE AMENDMENTS IN PREPARATION COMMITTEE. REQUIRED A. R. B. TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FACTORS DURING THIS RULEMAKING INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF ZERO EMISSIONS GENERATORS AND COURT HAS TO CONSIDER THE OPERATIONAL SIDE OF THESE GENERATORS THE POWER NEEDS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THE ABILITY FOR ZERO EMISSION PORTAL GENERATES. TAXING MEET THOSE NEEDS IN THE NEAR TERM AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. WITHOUT THESE ISSUES ADDRESSED THE CARD SHOULD PROBABLY PAUSE ANY EFFORT THAT WILL LIMIT THIS SPECIFIC CATEGORY- PORTABLE GENERATORS FOR CALIFORNIANS DURING PS PS EVENTS AND OTHER EMERGENCIES OUR CONSTITUENTS NEED TO HAVE ACCESS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVERS NOTED TO GENERATORS AND OTHER EMERGENCY RESPONSE EQUIPMENT AND I WOULD URGE THE AIRPORT TO BE MINDFUL OF THESE NEEDS- BUT FOR THE MOMENT BUT THIS BILL GOES IS TOO BROAD- AND I WILL HAVE TO STAY OFF IT THANK. YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN. YEAH SOME ISSUES AROUND RACE THAT I THINK DESERVE- SOME RESPONSE AND THERE IS A LONG PHASE IN ON THE GENERATORS WITH THIS BILL- YEAH THERE ARE ZERO EMISSION GENERATORS THAT ACTUALLY ARE AVAILABLE NOW THAT CAN PROVIDE ADEQUATE BACKUP POWER DURING A POWER OUTAGE- EVERYONE CAN CONTINUE USING THE GENERATOR THE OWNED WERE THEY ALREADY OWN OR THOSE OF THE PURCHASED BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT BUT THEN I WANTED REALLY EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT'S BEEN MADE BY THE SENATOR. FROM ORANGE COUNTY WHICH IS THAT MEANS REMEMBERS THEY WERE TAKEN IN THIS HOUSE THAT- WE'RE CARB. HOW IS GOING BE RQUIRED TO DETERMINE ZERO EMISSION GENERATOR AVAILABILITY. AND IF WE'RE STILL HAVING PS PS EVENTS AFTER TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT CAR ABOUT THE DISCRETION TO WAIVE EMISSIONS RULES IN AN EMERGENCY SO. HE DOES. THE IDEA THAT- THE THIS IS GONNA TAKE AWAY THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE THAT AND THERE'S NOT WITHOUT ANY ALTERNATIVE IS JUST NOT TUE- THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT- THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING IN REAL TIME THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- BUT LET'S LET'S FACE FACTS FOLKS THE TRUTH IS. WE'VE GOT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM THESE ENGINES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY EXCEEDING FEDERAL STATE STANDARDS FOR OZONE AND PARTICULATE MATTER IN THE SOUTH COAST AIR BASIN IN THE BAY AREA AND SAMPLE SOME OF KEENE VALLEY SACRAMENTO- THE- THE- THE STAGE ON FIRE. RIGHT I MEAN THE P. S. P. S. ISSUES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE BECAUSE OF. OUR INABILITY TO SOLVE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES- THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN THIS HOUSE REALLY DO MAKE THIS BILL- SENSIBLE AND WORKABLE- AND I AND I ALSO JUST SHOULD MENTION THAT YOU KNOW FARMING CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT HAVE AN EXEMPTION- FIRE AND POLICE HAVE AN EXEMPTION TO THE BILL. I COULD MEAN USER FORSTER FAR CLEANING SUCH AS- LARGE CHAIN SAWS ARE ALSO EXEMPT. AND IN INDIA THE DAY THERE'S BUILT IN FLEXIBILITY INTO THIS BILL WITH REGARDS TO THE ROLE. OF YOU- THIS IS SUPPOSED TO SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THIS SPACE IN REAL TIME BUT THE FACT IS UNLESS WE PUT PRESSURE. ON INDUSTRY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THE STEPS NECESSARY TO GET. THESE BETTER LOWER EMISSIONS ZERO EMISSIONS GENERATORS ON TO THE MARKET AND WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR FOLKS- AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY I. URGE THAT I VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR BREAUX. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RESPECT THE RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND I LINE MY COMMENTS- WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIEBER- AND THEN I ALSO WANNA LINES IN THE COMMENTS FOR THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER HE SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS A LONG PHASE IN FOR GENERATORS A LONG PHASE IN FOR LAWN MOWERS- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND SB THIRTY TWO PASS. MEMBER PEOPLE MAKING FLOOR SPEECHES ABOUT THE COMING AFTER YOUR LAWN MOWERS GARDENERS WON'T HAVE TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW ON ONE BILL THESE GAS LAWN MOWERS GAS MEDIATORS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND WE WERE PRACTICALLY LAUGHED OUT OF THE ROOM AND HERE WE ARE JUST A DECADE LATER COMING AFTER LAWN MOWERS AND WEED EATERS. AND I THINK ABOUT HOW THIS WILL AFFECT- YOU KNOW ENTREPRENEURS AND START THEIR OWN ONE MORE BUSINESS I THINK ABOUT A NONPROFIT THAT IN BAKERSFIELD HAS TAKEN THIS MEN'S RECOVERY HOME AND- THEY ACTUALLY STARTED A LAWN WHERE BUSINESS LOT OF THINGS WERE DONATED I THINK ABOUT RANCH PROPERTIES THAT HAVE. LARGE YARDS THAT HAVE YOU KNOW RIDING MOWERS. AND I ALSO THINK ABOUT- HOW MANY LAWN MOWERS ARE ACTUALLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CIVIC THERE'S FORTY MILLION PEOPLE DIVIDED BY TWO SO TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE AS A COUPLE PER SE A HOUSEHOLD- LET'S JUST SAY THERE'S TWENTY MILLION LAWN MOWERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ELIMINATING ALL THOSE LAWN MOWERS EVEN IF THERE WERE THAT MANY WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM ELIMINATE CARBON EMISSIONS THAT COME FROM ONE FIRE. AT THE CREEK FIRE THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR DEVASTATING HUNTINGTON LAKE IN THE SHAVER LAKE AREA- I GREW UP THERE. AND MY MOM GREW UP AT THEIR- END AND- YOU SMELL THE WALK TO THE LAKE AND WE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOREST MANAGEMENT MITIGATION AND ALL THOSE THINGS AND SEE VARIOUS BILLS. FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND YOU SMELL THE WALK TO THE LAKE BUT NOW YOU CAN'T YOU COULDN'T EVEN WALK TO THE LATE BECAUSE THEY WERE SO MUCH. UNDERBRUSH IN SO MANY FAN SMALL TREES- THEY'RE NOT THERE ANYMORE IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE THAT DR SEUSS BOOK NOW THE LORAX WHERE ALL THE TREES ARE GONE IN THAT BEAUTIFUL WOODED MOUNTAIN AREA. SO ONE FIRE- TO STOP THAT. TO STOP ONE FIRE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD MITIGATE A LOT OF THE CARBON EMISSIONS THAT WE HAVE- LOOK AT CARBON CAPTURING NEW TECHNOLOGY TO DO CARBON CAPTURE. AND THEN THERE'S A BILL THAT WAS FLOATING AROUND ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. TO ELIMINATE ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR CARBON CAPTURE BECAUSE THAT WOULD ALLOW WHAT THEY CALL THE- OIL INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE LONGER BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO CAPTURE. CARBON EMISSIONS. I MEAN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN THIS BUILDING JUST DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL. AND WHILE THE AWHILE THAT WE'RE BANNING LAWN MOWERS AND WE'RE GONNA START AFFECTING PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT MAKE A LIVING. MOWING LAWNS AND TAKING CARE OF OUR- HOMES AND BUSINESSES AND MEDIUMS AND ALL THAT PLACE. THE D. W. R. THE C. D. THE SKEWS ME THIS P. D. W. R. ANNOUNCED THURSDAY THAT THEY'LL BE EXPANDING NATURAL GAS POWER BY ADDING POWER PLANTS. DO THE ENERGY SUPPLY CONCERNS. THEY'LL HAVE FIVE NEW GAS POWERED POWER PLANTS THAT WE OUTLAWED BASICALLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THEY REALIZE THAT WE CAN'T DO THIS WE CAN'T ACHIEVE 1100% RENEWABLE ENERGY BY THAT DATE. THAT IS SET BY THIS LEGISLATURE NO MATTER WHO YOU BANNER WHO YOU PUT OUT OF BUSINESS OR- YOU REGULATE. WE% HAVE TO HAVE NATURAL GAS POWER AND OIL AND GAS. INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW WE'RE IMPORTING IT INSTEAD OF PRODUCING IT HERE. BUT THIS SPECIFIC BILL OUTLAWS AND HURTS SMALL BUSINESSES IT HURTS INDIVIDUALS WOULD HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY A NEW ELECTRIC LAWN MORE. ON THE PORTABLE EQUIPMENT THE GENERATORS WE HAVE THOSE P. S. P. S. SHUT OFFS LIKE TO HAVE TO BE. A LOT OF ELDERLY- IT'S A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY UP IN THE BEAR VALLEY SPRINGS AREA. IN MY DISTRICT THEY SURVIVED THE WINTERS. AND WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF POWER FOR FOUR FIVE AND SIX DAYS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THOSE PORTABLE GENERATORS. WELL THOSE PORTABLE GENERATORS OPERATE ON GASOLINE AND IF ALL OF YOUR POWER IS OUT. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE HOW YOU WOULD PLUG IN YOUR PORTABLE GENERATOR BATTERY OPERATED. TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR- MEDICAL DEVICES WORKED YOUR BREEDING EQUIPMENT WORKED AT NIGHT. AND IT'S JUST CRAZY TO THINK THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. AND YOU KNOW WHEN IT MOVES FORWARD I'M SURE WOULD BE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. BUT THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE WILL TACKLE THE FIRE. ISSUES AND YOU LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIEBER WHO'S LIVING THROUGH THIS DISASTER. RIGHT NOW IN HOUSE FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S ABOUT PROBLEM SOLVING. N. F. FORCE MITIGATION AND MANAGEMENT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS. AND YOU KNOW I TALKED TO MY CATTLE RANCHERS THAT CAN'T GRAZE CATTLE IN EAT DOWN THE GRASS- IN THE FOREST ANYMORE BECAUSE- THAT WAS. YOU KNOW STEPPING ON BIRD- NESTOR WHATEVER. THAT WHAT THE ISSUE WAS A FEW YEARS AGO AND ALL OF THAT IS CREATED CREATED THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN. I THINK WE JUST NEED TO GET ENGAGED AND START- DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE- IN A REALISTIC MANNER. AGAIN I THINK THAT DOING PASSING THIS BILL WILL HARM. A LOT OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS- AND IT WILL COST- A REGULATORY PROCESS WILL COST A LOT OF MONEY FOR THESE. INDIVIDUALS AND IT WILL DO NEXT TO NOTHING TO CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE NOW. THANK YOU SENATOR HURTS HER. THE FINNISH PRESIDENT TO GET BY I AM HAPPY ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN IN THE SOUTH OF SUSPECTED GENERATORS BECAUSE THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES- REEK WITH COMMON SENSE IF YOU HAVE THE POWER SHUT OFFS OR OTHER THINGS YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A SOURCE IN THE INTERIM TO GENERATE POWER. IN THE SECOND THING AND I KNOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS POLITICALLY CORRECT BUT I THINK IT'S TRUE WHAT I REMEMBER IS CHAIR OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE OF THIS HOUSE SOME YEARS AGO MY FIRST COMMITTEE WAS ABOUT THAN IN THE FORCE. AND ABOUT THE IMPACT OF FIRES AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN ON GREENHOUSE GASES IT IS TRUE THAT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE MADE SO MANY EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS BUT WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE THE FIRES WE LOOKING AT THE TIME IT TAKES IN TERMS OF WHEN THE FIRE SEASON STARTS WHEN ZIDANE'S REIGN ALL OF THOSE FACTORS INFORM BY CLIMATE CHANGE. TO ME ARTS IMPORTANT AS WE STAND HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION AND I MAKE THESE COMMENTS TODAY I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS MEASURE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE'S ANY FOLKS SOME CARB LISTENING TO THIS I JOINED WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE OF SAID THE SAME KIND OF COMMENT PLEASE AS YOU IMPLEMENT REGULATIONS UNDERSTAND AND LISTEN TO. THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT THE COMMENTS ARE MAKING AND WHAT GUIDANCE ARE GIVING. YOU AS YOU MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LAMAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AT THIRTEEN FORTY SIX AND I'VE I'VE HEARD OF IT I THINK AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION BUT YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS SOMEONE WHO IS- YOU KNOW COMES FROM A FAMILY WHERE WE HAVE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE GARDENERS IN OUR FAMILY AND LANDSCAPING BUSINESSES- IN THE EXTENDED FAMILY- I ALSO KNOW THAT OUR COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT MOVING FORWARD I HAD THE CHANCE TO VISIT- HELLO HI WHO DID THIS ON THIS ON THEIR OWN THE THEY STARTED TRANSITIONING- FROM. SOME OF THESE OLD OLDER TECHNOLOGIES TO NEWER TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO I THINK THE DISCUSSION ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT CONTRIBUTES TO IT- TO PUT THAT A LAWN MOWER OR- A LEAF BLOWER IS- IN IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS A FIRE I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR WE NEED TO DO WORK ON BOTH I ABSOLUTELY AGREE- THAT ARE YOU KNOW WILDFIRES- CONTRIBUTE MORE EMISSIONS INTO THE AIR DID ANY OF THESE DO IT BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT AS A LEGISLATURE- WE DON'T TRY TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE EVERYDAY THINGS THAT HELP- OUR ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS- TACKLE. SOME OF THESE BIGGER ISSUES AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT- THIS IS NEEDED- I KNOW THAT I THAT I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD NEED TO TRANSITION- BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT- AMONG. ALL OF THE YOU KNOW THINGS THAT WILL BREAK- THEIR LANDSCAPING BUSINESS THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THE DIRECTION THAT CALIFORNIA IS GOING IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE GOING AND- AND SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN COMMIT TO DOING BOTH THE LITTLE THINGS THAT WORK EVERY DAY BUT ALSO THE BIGGER ISSUES- THERE SOMETIMES FEEL MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND HARDER TO DO AND SO- WITH A LOT OF RESPECT- TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIEBER WHO I AGREE WITH WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE- AS IT RELATES. TO WILDFIRES SO THANK YOU. SENATOR VOTE. HELP CENTER BEDROOM ACROSS IS A NINE FIVE THANK YOU ARE THIS BILL MIGHT BE SUPPORTABLE IF THERE IS A PROVISION IN IT AND THAT ANYTHING THAT CARB CAME UP WITH IN TERMS OF THE REGULATIONS CAME BACK TO THIS BODY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT AND OUT THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED HERE WHEN WE HAVE OUR ELECTRIC GRID ALREADY OVER BURDENED DURING ALL OF THE- DEMAND ON IT WE'RE ADDING THAT MANY MORE TOO IT IS INCONCEIVABLE TO ME THAT WE WOULD ADD. IN JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THIS NEW BURDEN OF- ELECTRICITY ON THAT KOREA TO FOR A QUICK MENTAL VITAL VITAL TO SAVING LIVES AND WE'RE GIVING THAT TO KERR HOW MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE WHO ALL COMMENTED HERE THIS MORNING REGARDINGCAR DO THIS CAR DO THAT OF KARBALA ONLY DO THIS OR THAT THEY'RE NOT ELECTED BODY THEY HAVE INCREDIBLE POWER I SIT ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND OFTEN I BRING UP THE THAT VERY THING THAT CARBON IS NOT ELECTED BODY WE GIVE THEM THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DRAW. TO BRING IT BACK HERE TO SEE IF IT REALLY MATTERS THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED IN THOSE COMMITTEES FOR UNTIL THERE'S SOME. UNKNOWNS THAT COULD BE ADDED TO THIS THE WE ADDRESS BOTH OF THE ISSUES DOWN THIS BILL SHOULD NOT BE SUPPORTED TODAY IT WILL BE A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BURDEN ON THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE WHEN WE CAN'T HAVE THIS AN ALTERNATE A GAS POWERED EQUIPMENT THAT HELP OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND HEALTH ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN BLACKOUTS MANY TIMES AND ALL FOUR WEEKS AND IN IN FRANCE AND THE OTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY FOR MONTHS IT WOULD APPEAR SO PLEASE VOTE NO IT'S NOT SUPPORTABLE TODAY. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. THE OTHER MEMBER SEEN NINE SENATOR GONZALES WHICH ARE TOO CLOSE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE ROBUST DEBATE AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON ALL SIDES BUT I WANT TO REMIND US SMALL- ENGINES OFF ROAD ENGINES EMIT AN AVERAGE OF SIXTEEN POINT EIGHT TONS PER DAY. OF NITROGEN OXIDE AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE TONS PER DAY OF WHAT IS CALLED REACTIVE ORGANIC GASES IF THE STATE DOES NOT TAKE ACTION EMISSION LEVELS FROM SMALL ENGINES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE IN FACT THEY'LL BE MORE THAN TWICE THOSE FROM PASSENGER CARS- THAT'S JUST A REMINDER IN TERMS OF THE CARB AND DISCUSSION ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS DONE A GREAT JOB- AS MENTIONED IN SUPPLEMENTING THIS IS A SUPPLEMENT TO WHAT CARDS ALREADY REGULATING FOR TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AT TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT PHASE IN THE LATE PHASE IN AND AS IT PERTAINS TO GENERATORS THIS BILL ACTUALLY ONLY APPLIES TO THE SMALLEST OF GENERATORS UNDER TWENTY FIVE HORSE POWERS- WHICH ARE MOSTLY- USED FOR HOME BACKUP POWER OF COURSE AND AS A RUNNING AS OF A REFRIGERATOR OR FOR CAMPING SO IT ONLY APPLIES THERE AND IT DOES NOT APPLY TO STATIONARY GENERATE LARGE STATIONARY GENERATORS AND DIESEL GENERATORS. WHICH AGAIN IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS BILL JUST TO PROVIDE MORE CLARIFICATION THERE I KNOW HE WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU ESPECIALLY AS THERE IS A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET APPROPRIATION THAT WILL GET INTO THE WEEDS OF THIS POLICY WITH SO WITH THAT I.

ADDITIONALLY MANY PEOPLE ON THEIR PARTNER ON THE PARTNER'S HEALTH PLANS AS A RESULT MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER FOR THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER IS THE PERSON WHO RECEIVES THE COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT SERVICES RENDERED AND AN EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS. IN SOME INSTANCES THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER MAY RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TYPE OF CARE PROVIDED THAT THE PATIENT DOES NOT WANT REVEALED TO THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER IN SOME CASES IT CAN EVEN BE DANGEROUS FOR THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT SERVICES ANOTHER PATIENT ON THEIR PLAN HAS RECEIVED. FOR EXAMPLE A TRANS YOUTH MAY NOT WANT THEIR PARENTS TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE ACCESSING GENDER AFFIRMING SERVICES A WOMAN WHO IS ACCESSING REPRODUCTIVE CARE OR CARE RELATED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MAY NOT WANT HER PERFECT PARTNER TO KNOW THAT SHE IS ACCESSING THAT CARE. THIS BILL UPDATES EXISTING PATIENT PRIVACY LAWS TO DO A FEW THINGS FIRST IT AUTOMATICALLY ENSURES THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY REGARDING SENSITIVE CITY SERVICES. AS DEFINED ARE CONFIDENTIAL AND NOT SENT TO THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER SECOND IT EXPANDS EXISTING DEFINITION OF SENSITIVE SENSITIVE SERVICES TO INCLUDE GENDER AFFIRMING CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE EXTENDING AUTOMATIC CONFIDENTIALITY FOR THESE SERVICES THIRD IT ENSURES THAT PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT RECEIVING SENSITIVE SERVICES HAVE A PATHWAY TO REQUEST CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN. AND LASTLY IT INSURES THAT PATIENTS ARE AT DID ABOUT THE CALL. RIGHTS BY REQUIRING PLANTS TO PROVIDE NOTICE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR WE HAVE HEARD FROM OPPOSITION SOME FALSEHOODS THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE EXISTING MEDICAL CONSENT LAWS NOR. DOES IT CHANGE THE AGE OF CONSENT FOR ANY SERVICE ALL THIS BILL DOES IS ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED. CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS CAN RECEIVE IT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON FALL ITEM SEVENTY SIX ANY ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION INTEGRATE CENTER TOLD ALL. MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I RISE WITH CONCERNS ABOUT ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR SPECIALLY AS A PARENT. WOULD YOU BE ENCOURAGING PARENTS AND FAMILIES TO BE INVOLVED WITH THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES NOT REMOVING THEM FROM IT. IF NEEDED. GIVE PARENTS THE TOOLS AND SUPPORT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO REALLY HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR CHILDREN. AS THEY SEEK MEDICAL PROCEDURES THIS BILL IN AN EFFORT TO FURTHER HIDE INFORMATION FROM PARENTS AND PARTNERS IN CARE GIVERS WOULD PUT POLICY HOLDERS IN THE IMPOSSIBLE POSITION OF BEING FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR BILLS. HE DID NOT IN HER CANNOT VERIFY AS BEING LEGITIMATE. ADDITIONALLY IT FURTHER LIMITS PARENTS ABILITIES TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN BY REMOVING THEM FROM SENSITIVE CONVERSATION AS EARLY AS TWELVE YEARS OLD. AND I NEED TO ADD THAT IN OTHER YOU KNOW I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SITTING IN PUBLIC SAFETY. AND PUBLIC SECTOR YOU OFTEN HEAR HOW. MANY OF OUR YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY SHOULD NOT BE LIABLE FOR DECISIONS. THAT THEY MAKE IN THEIR LIFE DURING THAT JOURNEY AND YET AT THIS TIME WE ARE LEAVING THEM ALONE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND DO. A PROCEDURE PROCEDURES OR MEDICAL TREATMENTS WITHOUT THE GUIDANCE OF AN ADULT IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK. RENEWABLE THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSIONOR DEBATE. ON THIS ITEM SENATOR GIRL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I TOO I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR- IN LINE WITH MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS- THAT JUST PREVIOUSLY SPOKE AND THIS BILL IS A DIRECT ATTACK ON ON PARENTS RIGHTS. IT UNDERMINES PARENTS RIGHTS IN THE GUIDE- IN. IN THEIR RIGHT TO GUIDE AND CONTROL- HEALTH CARE FOR THEIR MINOR CHILDREN AS TWELVE YEARS OLD I MEAN TWELVE YEARS OLD YOU'RE IN FIFTH GRADE. YOU SHOULDN'T BE THINKING ABOUT GOING OFF OF CAMPUS AND- GETTING AN ABORTION AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- OR HAVING A MEDICAL PROCEDURE ANY MEDICAL PROCEDURE- WITHOUT YOUR PARENTS KNOWLEDGE AND CONSULTATION. THE BILL ENCOURAGES. CHILDREN TO ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES ALONE TO HIDE IT FROM THEIR PARENTS- I THINK THAT CREATES A DIVISION BETWEEN PARENTS. AND CHILDREN- I THINK THE STATE INTERFERING IN RAISING CHILDREN- THESE DAYS IS JUST CONTINUALLY OVER REACHING I KNOW IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE IT'S AROUND THE ISSUE OF ABORTION- SEIZURES- REGARDING SEX- SEXUAL TRANSITIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT'S WHAT THE- THE LANGUAGE HAS BEEN THE LAST FEW YEARS. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT NOT ONLY PARENTS ARE BEING REMOVED FOR HAVING THEIR SAY IN THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S LIVES BUT THIS BILL GOES FURTHER TO REQUIRE. SOME TERRORISTS TO PAY FOR THOSE AND DISCLOSED PROCEDURES ARE BASED ON THEIR MEDICAL INSURANCE. AND NONE OF US WOULD WANT TO PAY FOR A BILL THAT WE HAD NO INFORMATION ON THE BILITY. TO ADDRESS- WHAT HAPPENED I THINK THE MONEY IS JUST A SECONDARY THING I THINK THE ISSUE IS BETWEEN THE PARENT AND THE CHILD. AND HAVING A PARENT A CHILD AS YOUNG AS TWELVE YEARS OLD- THAT'S THE IN THE FOURTH GRADE BEGINNING A FIFTH GRADE A TWELVE YEAR OLD CHILD MAKING MEDICAL DECISIONS. ABOUT THEIR- ABOUT MEDICAL ISSUES RIGHT COULD YOU IMAGINE AS A PARENT MOST OF US ARE PARENTS IN HERE SOME OF US ARE NOT. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF YOU SEND YOUR KID OFF TO SCHOOL AND- AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT AS A TEACHER OR A SCHOOL NURSE TO COME TO A CLINIC TO HAVE A MEDICAL PROCEDURE. AND UNDER ANESTHESIA OR UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA OR WHATEVER SOMETHING HAPPENED AND THAT CHILD LOST ITS LIFE. I MEAN YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THESE PROCEDURES THAT ARE GOING ON AND TO HAVE. THIS BILL COME FORWARD AND HAVE THE INSURANCE COMPANY PAY FOR IT- WITHOUT THE PARENTS KNOWLEDGE. OF ANYWAY. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD LOOK AT. WE SHOULD WHAT TEXAS DID TRULY WE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT WHAT TEXAS DID TO PROTECT THE LIFE OF THE UNBORN WE SHOULD ALSO LOOK AT OTHER STATES THAT ARE LOOKING AT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD PROTECT. NOT ONLY THE ON BOARD BUT THE INDIVIDUALS- KIDS RIGHTS. THEIR KIDS THEIR KIDS HAVING THE ABILITY DISCUSS THESE THINGS WITH PARENTS. THERE ARE KIDS- THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HOSPITAL NONPROFITS. THEY'RE NOT THEM THERE ARE KIDS AND I WOULD ASK OF RESPECTFULLY FOR A NO VOTE. IN MAKING THESE DECISIONS- MAKE BE THE PARENTS AND THE FAMILIES DECISIONS. AND NOT JUST THE CHILD STANDING ALONE AT TWELVE YEARS OLD. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING AND SEEING NINE CENTER LEVEL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I JUST WANT TO HELP MY- COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD WHEN SHE'S TALKING ABOUT TWELVE YEAR OLD THAT'S CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE CURRENT LAW SO IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THAT THEN YOU SHOULD INTRODUCE A BILL ENTRENCHING SALAH. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE WHICH I SAID IN MY INITIAL REMARKS DOES NOT CHANGE EXISTING MEDICAL CONSENT LAWS NOR DOES IT CHANGE THE AGE OF CONSENT FOR ANY SERVICE LET ME REPEAT MYSELF ALL THIS BILL DOES IS ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS.

SENATE BILL SEVEN FORTY TWO BY SENATOR PAN AN ACT RELATING TO CRIMES AND DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE OF-CITRIX MEDIA. CENTER PLANT THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SENATOR SESAME SEVEN FORTY TWO IS BACK ON CONCURRENCE. SINCE WE LAST VOTED ON THIS BILL HERE ON THIS FLORIDA NUMBER OF CODE REPORT THAT'S IN CALIFORNIA'S RIDGES INTO OVER SIXTY SIX THOUSAND. IN FACT THE MORE INFECTIOUS DELTA VARIANT HAS MADE INCREASING OUR VACCINATION RATES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO CONTROLLING THIS PANDEMIC. STILL THAT HASN'T STOPPED SPREADING HOWEVER THE EXTREMISTS CONTINUE TO ESCALATE THEIR ATTACKS ON VACCINATION SITES. ARE SHOWING THAT VACCINE CLINICS IN COMMUNITIES WITH THIS- WITH THE TERMINATING HARASSING EVEN ASSAULTING PEOPLE- PATIENTS AND EALTH CARE WORKERS TRYING TO SHUT CLINICS DOWN. FACT AT LEAST TWO OCCASIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO SCREAM AS IF YOU'RE DRIVEN TO CARS INTO VACCINATION SITES AND TRY TO STRIKE HEALTH CARE WORKERS. HOWEVER WE HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK ON SB SEVEN FORTY TWO TENDERLY CRAFTED SO WE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO VACCINES PROTECT PATIENT PRIVACY SAFETY FOR PATIENTS HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND FREEDOM SPEECH. FAMILY MAN IT'S NEAR THE DISTANCE TO WHAT WE KNOW AIRBORNE ERRORS AND ERRORS ALL DISEASES CAN BE SPREAD AS DECLARATIONS AND FINDINGS. MAKES TECHNICAL CHANGES ENSURED THE BILLS CONTENT NEUTRAL AND CLARIFIED THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT SUPERSEDE EXISTING REGULATIONS AROUND LAWFUL UNION PICKETING ESPECIALLY. ASPIRIN I VOTE ON CONCURRENCE. THANK YOU ANY FOR THIS IN DEBATE SENATOR NELSON. PROSELYTISM REC CENTER ARGENEAU VOTE HOW FAR ARE WE GOING TO GOAL IN SOCIETY TO STIFLE FREE SPEECH AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS CONSTITUENCIES HAVE A DIFFERENCE SO WHAT DO THEY WANT TO DO ALL. THAT SOMEBODY HAVE THEIR SAY NO NO WE'RE GONNA. REALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT. THAT'S ALL THIS IS ABOUT IT'S CENTER AND I REGIONAL. THANK YOU SENATOR GIRL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL HATES FREE SPEECH UNDER THE CONSTITUTION WHAT DO YOU LIKE THE SPEECH OR NOT IT'S FREE SPEECH- PROTESTERS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW OVER ELEVEN OH TWO IN THE FEAR THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE A VACCINE MANDATE- THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT WHEN PEOPLE CAME OUT LAST SUMMER AND BLACK LIVES MATTER AND THEY DID PROTEST AND- YOU KNOW TORE DOWN STATUES YOU KNOW I DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT- YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BUILD A DAMAGED PROPERTY BUT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE OUT THERE. YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE A GRIEVANCE AGAINST THEIR GOVERNMENT THEIR GOVERNMENT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THIS SPEECH DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BAN THE SPEECH- YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT VACCINE INFORMATION THE OTHER DAY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO MENTIONED ALL THIS. FALL STUFF THAT HE SAYS COMES OFF OF FOX NEWS. AND THE RIGHT WING AND IT WAS MENTIONED. EARLIER BY ANOTHER COLLEAGUE THAT YOU KNOW WITH WITH THE RIGHT PUTS FORWARD AT THE EXTREME RIGHT. IF YOU LOOK AT. AND THE STUFF SURROUNDING VACCINES A LOT OF THE MISINFORMATION COMES FROM CNN MSNBC THE ADMINISTRATION. US BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CONSISTENT RIGHT. FOR INSTANCE. LAST YEAR OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS NON VACCINATED WORKING IN HOSPITALS AND COVERT NINETEEN. ALL THE WAY THROUGH NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. THEY WERE HEROES MADE YARD SIGNS ALL OVER BILLBOARDS WERE PUT AT. HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE HEROES THIS EAR THEY'RE EVIL AND THEY'RE AWFUL BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO GET VACCINATED SOME OF THEM DO. SO I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR MESSAGING CONSISTENCY IS FOLLOWING THE CONSTITUTION. THIS IS FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND JUST LIKE I SAID THOSE PROTESTERS OUTSIDE OF THE ONES THAT WERE HERE LAST SUMMER OR THE WORSHIP EVENT. FOR PROTESTING NOT ALLOWING TO BE YOU KNOW ABLE TO WORSHIP IN CHURCHES. AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH SO IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DRIVE THEIR CARS INTO. CLINICS THEY DON'T HAVE TO WRITE TO CAUSE HARM TO ANOTHER PERSON. AND YOU KNOW IN SOME TYPE OF VIOLENT PROTESTS. BUT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO STAND UP. WHETHER IT'S REGARDING THIS SITUATION OR THE SITUATION THAT WE HAD THE OTHER DAY THAT. TALKS ABOUT AND YOU KNOW ABORTION CLINICS. YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE WHO PRAY FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING ITO THOSE SITUATIONS. AND ASK THEM TO KEEP THAT BABY THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE THERE IT'S A PUBLIC SIDEWALK. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE THERE TO PROTECT PROTEST. HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT MANDATORY VACCINES IN ABOUT MANDATED VACCINES AND ABOUT VACCINES IN GENERAL. AND I THINK THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE ALL THIS GOING ON IF THERE WAS SOME TYPE OF CONSISTENCY COMING OUT OF BOTH ADMINISTRATIONS. PREVIOUS THIS ONE. AND THE ONE THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR MAN I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR PERMISSION ASKED. WILL THE- PRESENTER TAKE A QUESTION- HI HAS THERE BEEN ANY CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS AS LEAD COUNSEL WAITIN ON WHETHER THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT. HI YES THIS IS BEEN EVALUATED BY LEGAL COUNSEL AND- THIS- BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT- THIS SEEMS CONSISTENT JUST UPON READING THIS WITH- THE RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE FOR POLLING PLACES AND- AGAIN JUST YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO FIRST YEAR OF LAW SCHOOL. ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT CERTAINLY PROTECTS OUR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH BUT THERE ARE LIMITS THE FIRST AMENDMENT YOU CAN'T YELL FIRE IN A CROWDED THEATER. YOU CAN'T INJURE PEOPLE AND I BELIEVE THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT. PASSING PEOPLE PHYSICALLY INTIMIDATING THEM PREVENTING THEM FROM GETTING VACCINES- I THINK FALLS OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF SPEECH IN INTO THE- ACTIVITY OF UNPROTECTED- ACTIVITIES THAT THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HARASS INTIMIDATE- WITH THREAT OF VIOLENCE- PEOPLE FROM. DOING A PERMITTED ACTIVITY- AND I WOULD JUST- MAYBE TAKE ISSUE WITH ONE COMMENT MADE. WITH FROM MY CAR BUT MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ILLEGAL AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S PROTECTED FREE SPEECH TO TEAR DOWN STATUES SO WHETHER THAT'S BLACK LIVES MATTER. WITH THAT THE PROTESTERS OUTSIDE IF THEY WERE TO TEAR DOWN A STATUE- THAT CROSSES THE LINE AND DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT SHOULD BE PROSECUTED- SO AGAIN. I STAND FOR MOST OF THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE SHOULD PROTECT FREE SPEECH- BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT- WHEN SPEECH. GIVES WAY TO VIOLENT ACTION OF THE THREAT OF VIOLENT ACTION BUT IT NO LONGER IS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. IF NOT SENATOR PANIC YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LET'S BE CLEAR SB SEVEN FOUR TWO DOES NOT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM PROTESTING ARE SPEAKING OUT IT PREVENTS THEM FROM HARASSING.

GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS WELCOME BACK FROM OUR RECESS. WITHOUT OBJECTION WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO FILE ITEM THIRTY. SP TWO SENATOR BRADFORD. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL TWO BY SENATOR BRADFORD AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. CENTRE BRADFORD THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I'M HERE TO PRESENT AS FEATURE DO BETTER KNOWN AS THE KENNETH ROSS JUNIOR PLEASE TO CERTIFICATION ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHICH IS BACK ON CONCURRENCE THIS BILL IS JOINT AUTHORED BY MYSELF AND OUR PRESIDENT PRO TEM TONI ATKINS AND IT'S A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. I WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ENGAGED THEMSELVES IN THIS DISCUSSION OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF TO BRING US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. THIS BILL DOES TOO SIMPLE THINGS THE BILL MAKES CHANGES TO STRENGTHEN THE THOMAS PAINE ACT CIVIL RIGHTS BY CLARIFYING THROUGH THE MOST EGREGIOUS IMMUNITIES CALMLY ASSERTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO CLAIM- TO CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE BAN ACT. IT THEN ALSO CREATES A STATEWIDE PROCESS TO REVOKE THE CERTIFICATION. OF AN OFFICER AFTER. MEETING CRIMES OR TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT TO THE MISCONDUCT AGAIN WE'RE ASKING OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO FOLLOW. OVER TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS TO HAVE A FAIR AND TRANSPARENT WAY OF DECERTIFYING BAD OPERATORS. MANY CHANGES IS BILL HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE YOU LAST HEARD IN THE SENATE. AND NOW REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE BY POST. COMMISSION TO DECERTIFY ANY OFFICER IT ALLOWS FOR THE SUSPENSION RATHER THAN THE MEDIA- DECIRTE ALTOGETHER- LEAVES OUT OPTION IS AS AN OPTION IT REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT OF HAVING TWO VICTIMS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT ABUSE OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ON THE ADVISORY BOARD BUT ALLOWS A GOVERNOR TO GIVE GREAT CONSIDERATION TO THAT- ALL BOARD MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE FORTY HOURS OF TRAINING. ON LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES AND STANDARDS- THE LICENSE FEE HAS BEEN WAIVED FOR THOSE OFFICERS PROVIDED BOARD CAN NO LONGER IT INITIATE AN INVESTIGATION THEY CAN ONLY I RECOMMEND TO THE COMMISSION. AND SO ON I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY A TECHNICAL ERROR BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL REGARDING ONE OF THE MEMBERS TO THE BILL AND IT'S BEING ADDRESSED IN ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT MIMIC CLARIFIES THAT EXISTING LAW REGARDING ISSUES. R. PRECLUSION APPLIES TO THE BILL. REGARDING ISSUE PRECLUSION IMPLIES THE BILL WAS PLACED IN THE WRONG SECTION BUT IT WILL BE CORRECTED IN A DIFFERENT BILL IN THE COMING DAYS. AGAIN MEMBERS. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EFFORT HERE TO GET US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD BILL THAT WE AS CALIFORNIANS CAN BE PROUD OF. LAW ENFORCEMENT STILL REMAINS A POLLS BUT MANY OF THE MEMBERS HAVE MADE THAT WE MADE ADDRESS MANY THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT- CREATING A SYSTEM THAT WOULD ONLY PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO WE'VE CLEARLY NOW THAT WE'VE SEEN A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OF THE POLICE POLICING THEMSELVES AND IT DOESN'T WORK- THIS BILL DOESN'T MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DECERTIFY OFFICERS NOR WILL IT. CALLS OFFICERS TO BE CERTIFIED FOR MINOR MINOR OFFENSES AGAIN THIS IS A PRO. A LAW ENFORCEMENT MEASURE IT PROTECTS THE MAJORITY OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO DO THEIR JOB IN A RESPONSIBLE AND HONORABLE WAY ON THE DAILY BASIS THAT BASIS IT ONLY ADDRESSES THOSE BAD ACTORS. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE- TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS CONTACTED BY THE MAYOR OF TORRENTS IN MY DISTRICT. THE LET ME KNOW THAT- THEY HAD TO LET GO OF THIRTEEN OFFICERS IN THEIR CITY- IT CREATED. A REAL ABUSES RACISM AND A LOT OF HORRIBLE PRACTICES. OF THOSE THIRTEEN THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED TO READ- BEEN ON SUSPENSION INTO WERE FIRED. TWO OF ARE YOU BEING RETIRED. DO YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN REHIRED. SO IF THEY HAD. BRACES AND ABUSE OF POWER PRACTICES IN TORRANCE. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD NOT CONTINUE IN ANOTHER COMMUNITY THIS BILL JUST STOPS THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IT STOPS THOSE INDIVIDUALS FROM CONTINUING OFF. AS MY MOTHER SAYS A LEOPARD CAN'T CHANGE HER STRIPES ARE THEIR SPOTS. AND THESE OFFICERS WILL NOT CHANGE SO THE CERTIFICATION IS THE ONLY WAY TO RID. OUR COMMUNITIES AND CREATE. A LEVEL OF TRUST. S. B. A S. B. TO CREATE THE STRONGER C. CERTIFICATION SYSTEM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHAT MORE DO PROCESS FOR OFFICERS WITH CIVILIAN REPRESENTATION AND INPUT. THIS BILL STOPS THE PROCESS. THAT IS EFFECTIVE IN READING DEPARTMENTS OF BAD OFFICERS PROTECTING OFFICERS WHO DO THEIR JOB WELL. AND ALL THE WHILE BEING WORKABLE FOR POST THE POST COMMISSION. THE TIME IS NOW TO CREATE A FAIR AND TRANSPARENT THE CERTIFICATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA- ANYWAY. OUR COMMUNITIES MUST HAVE FAITH AND ALL THE OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA. ARE HELD TO THE HIGHEST STANDARD IT WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- WINTERIZED TODAY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I DID NOT SUPPORT IT WHEN IT CAME TO THE SENATE FLOOR- NUMBER OF MONTHS AGO AND THERE WERE A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT I WAS EALLY CONCERNED ABOUT AND- AND I WELL I JUST WANT TO STAND UP AND SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR BECAUSE HE WORKED THIS HARD. HE LISTENED AND TOOK CARE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED AND THE ISSUES THAT I WAS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT- FIRST OF ALL HE HE- HE TOOK CARE OF THE ISSUES WITH THE BANE ACT THAT I HAD CONCERN- FOR IN IN THE- BILL ORIGINALLY. AND SECOND OF ALL- THE HE MADE SOME STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE COMMISSION AND- THE- THE COMMISSION. THE- THE BOARD THAT HAS BEEN BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THIS BILL AND THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN DISCIPLINING AND BEING RESPONSIBLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FURTHER- THE HIGHER AND FIRING UP THEIR POLICE OFFICERS AND- WHAT DID THE CHANGES DO IS IT. ELIMINATES THE POSSIBILITY OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO MOST IMPORTANTLY IS IT. MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WHO ARE THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS OF THE BOARD SUPERVISES THE HIGHER. ON A D. THAT POLICE OFFICERS THE- THAT WORKIN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY HAVE A PROCESS TO GO THROUGH INTO THAT PROCESS IS RESPECTED AND IS PART OF THE- OF THE COMMISSION- OVERSIGHT AS WELL SO I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND- AND I ASK THAT YOU. SUPPORT SB TWO. THANK YOU CENTER COVERDELL CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE- IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I THINK THAT DOES OUR- CALLING FROM SALINAS JUST POINTED OUT THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED IN GOING THROUGH A LOT OF CHANGES SINCE WE SAW IT ON OUR FLOOR. AND AS THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT THE BILL HAS ANYONE CAN SEE FROM THE FLOOR ANALYSIS STILL HAS A GOOD DEAL OF OPPOSITION FROM OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY. AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT- THE VAST VAST MAJORITY. OF OUR OFFICERS AND THE OFFICERS IN THE DIFFERENT ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTED AND THAT OPPOSITION LIST WILL NEVER BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. AND THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF OUR PEACE OFFICERS IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT ABOUT THE WALL THE LAW. AND THEY ACT ACCORDINGLY THEY ACT WITH INTEGRITY THEY ACT APPROPRIATELY. AND IT- I COMPLETELY APPRECIATE THAT. ANY CHANGE THAT WOULD- INTENTIONALLY AFFECT THE STATUS OF A COLLEAGUE CAN CAN CAUSE AN ASSOCIATION TO BE IN OPPOSITION BUT I THINK IN FACT THIS BILL WILL GREATLY HELP OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BECAUSE IT'LL GIVE US THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE OFFICERS AND VERY FEW THAT FEEL THEY ARE ABOVE THE LAW AND THAT ACT IN SUCH A WAY THAT DISPLAYS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE REGARD FOR THE LAW. THAT THEY WOULD NOT CONTINUE IN SUCH SERVICE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT NOW WHEN WE HAVE SOME PORTIONS OF OUR COMMUNITIES MISTRUSTING ONE OF COURSE ME WE REALLY NEED OUR COMMUNITIES TO TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS EVERYONE'S TRUST TO DO THEIR JOB TO PROPERLY INVESTIGATE A CRIME THAT IS COMMITTED YOU. SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND THEN OF COURSE TO HELP YOU WISH TO BRING A CASE AGAINST SOMEONE SO TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE WE NEED THAT TRUST AND WE NEED TO HAVE OFFICERS THAT APPRECIATE THAT TRUST AND AS I SAID THE VAST MAJORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO SERVE EACH AND EVERYONE OF US THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPRECIATE THAT. SO WHILE I. KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT WOULD- PREFER THAT WE DO NOT PASS THIS LAW I THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL BE A GREAT ASSET TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND FOR THAT I STAND IN SUPPORT NOW ASK THAT YOU ALSO BOWTIE. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB TWO HIGH BELIEVE THAT MOST OF US WOULD- PERSONALLY SUPPORT A POLICY OF DECERTIFICATION FOR PROBLEM POLICE OFFICERS. HOWEVER THIS BILL- IT WAS APPROVED IN THE ASSEMBLY OR IMPROVED ACTUALLY IN THE ASSEMBLY IT STILL HAS SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT JUSTIFY A NO VOTE. THE DEFINITION OF SERIOUSNESS CONTACT IS VAGUELY DESCRIBEDIN WOULD BE LEFT UP TO INTERPRETATION OF POST COMMISSION THE POST COMMISSION VICE REPORT. WHICH IS AN UNELECTED BODY OF APPOINTEES THE POST ADVISORY BOARD ITSELF IS PROBLEMATIC SINCE TWO PUBLIC MEMBERS ARE ENCOURAGED ENCOURAGED TO BE VICTIMS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT MAKING A MOCKERY OF THE IDEA. THAT ANY POLICE OFFICER WOULD GET A FAIR TRIAL OR A FAIR HEARING. I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT STRIPPING AWAY STATUTORY PROTECTIONS SUCH AS POLICE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS. MEMBERS WHEN THIS BILL WAS PRESENTED TO THE FULL ASSEMBLY THE FLOOR JACKIE SAID THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL. I WOULD SAY- IT'S A BAD BILL AND THAT WHEN WE MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO BECOME POLICE OFFICERS IN THE STATE- THIS BILL IS EXACTLY WHAT THAT WOULD DO. SPT WEAKENS THE PROCESS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT INPUTS THEIR CAREER INTO THE HANDS OF A BIASED UNACCOUNTABLE BOARD- THIS UNACCOUNTABLE BOARD IS NOT ON THE STREET AT NIGHT WHEN OFFICERS HAVE TO MAKE A SPLIT SECOND DECISION IT'S ALL EASY FOR US TO YOU MONDAY MORNING ACCORDING QUARTERBACKING AND LOOKING AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED- THAT POLICE OFFICERS MADE A SPLIT DOES SECOND DECISION ON NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY KNEW THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND PEOPLE CAN ALWAYS SAY- I WOULD HAVE DONE- THIS WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER OR MAKE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST OFFICERS BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT RUNNING DOWN AN ALLEY CHASING SOMEBODY THAT HAS SOMETHING IN THEIR HAND IDENTIFIED AS A FIREARM OR A WEAPON. AND IT'S A STICKER IT'S WHATEVER IT IS WHATEVER THE STORY ENDS UP BEING AT THAT VERY MOMENT POLICE OFFICERS DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S SUCH A BROAD DEFINITION IN THIS BILL. AND I KNOW A LOT OF THE SURROUNDS- THE GEORGE FLOYD- IT INCIDENT WHERE WE- ALL OF US WATCHED IN HORROR. AS DEREK CHAUVIN- BRUTALLY MURDERED BY AN INDIVIDUAL A HUMAN RIGHTS A HUMAN WITH RIGHTS. AND HE WAS A BAD POLICE OFFICER. BUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS. ERIC CHAUVIN IS NOW SERVING OVER TWENTY TWO YEARS IN PRISON. SO THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE WORKS AND WHEN SOMETHING. THAT IS ATROCIOUS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE FLOYD. GETS PUT IN AT IT GETS THAT GOES THROUGH THE SYSTEM THEN OFFICERS- ARE SERVING IN PRISON JUST LIKE IT'S PROVEN THAT. THEIR CHILDREN AS- I THINK TO LABEL ALL OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE THAT PROTECT US AND KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. OF LIKE AN OFFICER LIKE THEIR CHILDREN IS UNACCEPTABLE AND NOT RIGHT. THE PEOPLE IN BLUE THAT SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE A DEEPER RESPECT. AND I WOULD ASK YOU FOR IT A NO VOTE. THE CENTER GROUP CENTER HER TADO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I KNOW THAT WHEN THIS MEASURE WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO THE SENATE FLOOR I DID NOT SUPPORTED I HAVE. I HAD CONCERNS AT THE MOMENT. AND TO BE HONEST THERE'S STILL A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERNED AND A LITTLE BIT OF FEAR AND ANOTHER IS A LITTLE BIT THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR- ESPECIALLY AMONGST OUR PUBLIC SAFETY- COMMUNITY. REGARDING THIS AND MANY OTHER BILLS BUT- I THINK THAT THE SPILL IS. WORKING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO PROVIDE. JUSTICE NOT JUST FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS BUT ALSO FOR ALL THE GOOD OFFICES AND ALL THE- PAUL'S WORK THAT THEY DO IN THE COMMUNITY AND- I'M NOT THE BIGGEST FAN OF THE WAY THE COMMISSIONERS ARE SET UP BUT- I HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IMPROVEMENTS. AND I HAVE FULL FAITH THAT THIS IS GOING TO WORK FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA FOR THESE REASONS I WILL BE INSTRUCTS THE PARDONING COURAGE ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT IT AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR HER TITLE MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR COM LONGER. MADAM CHAIR I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO- YOU KNOW THIS BILL HAS. GONE THROUGH- A METAMORPHOSIS QUITE FRANKLY- SINCE IT LEFT THIS FLOOR- AND TRAVELED ON TO THE ASSEMBLY- AND IT IS BACK- AND- IT IT. ARE THERE ARE SO MANY OF THE CONCERNS AND SUGGESTIONS ON THAT THE AUTHOR HEARD- FROM SO MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES ON THIS BILL. AND I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER A FEW THINGS. THAT THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE DOES NOT HAVE THE FINAL SAY. THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS FOLKS SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE. IF YOU WANT TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST YOU KNOW THAT OFTEN TIMES FOLKS DON'T ALWAYS TAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF AN ADVISORY COUNCIL. BUT THEY LIKE TO HAVE THAT ENTITY THERE. GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE. THIS BILL STILL WILL ALLOW FOR THE DECERTIFICATION OF BAD APPLES AND WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT BAD APPLES. PUT EVERYONE'S LIFE IN DANGER. INCLUDING THE LIVES OF THEIR PARTNERS AND THEIR COLLEAGUES. AND THEIR FELLOW OFFICERS ON THE FORCE AND THE LAST THING I JUST WANT TO REMIND US IS THAT. IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU LABEL YOURSELF IF YOU'RE AN ACTIVIST IF YOU'RE AN ACADEMIC IF YOU'RE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IF YOUR PRACTITIONER. YOU CAN COME TO THE TABLE WITH ALL OF THOSE LABELS. WHAT'S AT STAKE IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN. ALL OF THOSE FOLKS COME AND LISTEN TO CASES. AND DIG INTO THE INVESTIGATION. AND I HOPE THAT WE ARE NOT STILL CONTINUING TO BE AFRAID OF THOSE LABELS AND SUGGEST THAT IF YOU'RE AN ACTIVIST YOU CAN'T BE PRO PUBLIC SAFETY THAT IF YOU'RE A PRACTITIONER YOU CAN'T BE AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT IF YOU'RE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER YOU CAN'T BE AGAINST. CITIZENS WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT POLICE MISCONDUCT. WE SHOULDN'T LET LABELS MOTIVATE OUR FEARS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE HOPING THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE CAN ADD. WHICH AT THE END OF THE DAY ARE JUST DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. AND WE ALL KNOW THIS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IT'S AMAZING. HOW MANY SIMILARITIES WE HAVE WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES. WHY WOULD WE THINK THAT THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN IN THIS CASE WITH THIS BILL. I ONCE AGAIN JUST HAVE TO ASK US TO LEAN INTO THE FAITH THAT WE ALL HAVE. IN PEOPLE WHO WOULD COME TO THE SPACE WANTING TO DO THE RIGHT THING WANTING TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR LAW EFORCEMENT WANTING TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR CITIZENS AND ULTIMATELY WANTING TO BE PART OF SOMETHING THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL FOR THIS STATE. THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE INCREDIBLY ASPIRATIONAL AND I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THEY ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE ALSO NOW IN THIS BILL. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB TWO. THANK YOU SENATOR COM AUGER SITTER DRAWS SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO- VERY SIMPLY SAY THANK YOU I'M A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR THANK YOU FOR STICKING WITH THIS THANK YOU FOR WORKING ON THIS- TAKING AMENDMENTS MEETING WITH PEOPLE AND PURSUING WHAT IS FAIR AND AN HONEST WAY OF ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES- SO. SIMPLE AS THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DRAWS SO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. FINGERBOARD IS. WE DISCUSS THIS ISSUE IT AT GREAT LENGTH IN JUDICIARY. AND I MAYBE I CAN POSE A QUESTION THROUGH THE CHAIR TO THE ALTAR SET A RECORD FOR YOU TO QUESTION. PLEASE PROCEED MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE EARLIER ITERATION OF THIS BILL. AT THE COMMISSION I WOULD ADVISE THAT THE POSTER TO CATION BOARD BUT THAT WOULD BE A BIT OF AN THIS MISNOMER THAT. THIS ADVISORY BOARD RENDERS A DECISION AND THEN ONLY HOST WITH OVERWHELMINGLY DISAPPROVE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE FORCED TO FOLLOW AND EXECUTE THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMMISSION IS THAT IS THAT AN ACCURATE VERY VERY IN AFTER THE GAME PLEASE I'LL FORWARD IS JUST THAT AN ADVISORY BOARD POLL STILLHAS FINAL SAY ON WHETHER OFFICER SHOULD BE SUSPENDED. OR DECERTIFY. BUT I THINK I WANT TO HONE IN ON THAT POINT IF I MAY. THROUGH THE CHAIRS. MY UNDERSTANDING SO IT IS IT AN INCORRECT UNDERSTANDING. THAT THIS ADVISORY BOARD ISSUES A RECOMMENDATION. AND THEN THE POST CERTIFICATION BOARD CAN AGREE DISAGREE OR DISREGARD. THAT IS CORRECT ARE YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THE RECOMMENDATION SO YOU KNOW PRESUMPTION OR AN INCREASED BURDEN OF PROOF USED BY THE POST BOARD TO OVERRULE. THE DIRECTION OF THE ADVISORY BOARD ADVISORY BOARD AGAIN IT'S JUST THAT ADVISORY THE POST IS NOT HAVE TO ACT ON ANYTHING THAT DIVIDES REPORTS SUGGEST. FORGIVE ME ONCE ONE LAST TIME. IS THE BURDEN OF PROOF DIFFERENT. MEANING THIS POST HAVE TO OVER RULE. OR RENDER A DECISION THAT THE ADVISORY BOARD'S DECISION WAS WRONGLY MADE IN ORDER FOR THEM. TO TO REACH A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION AGAIN THE ADVISORY BOARD IS NOT REACHING A CONCLUSION EIGHT FIVE FIVE REPORTERS ONLY MAKING A SUGGESTION. THANK YOU THINK CENTRE BOARD JUST MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER BRADFORD PLEASE CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS WHO SPOKE IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION OF THIS MEASURE THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE A FOLKS. WE'VE LIVED IN THIS COUNTRY FAR TOO LONG AND WE ALL KNOW THE IMPORTANCE AND THE NEED OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS BILL IS JUST THAT A PATROL LAW ENFORCEMENT BILL BUT IT'S TO PROTECT THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WE ALL KNOW PERSONALLY I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE POLICE OFFICERS AND THEY'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I HAVE CHILDHOOD FRIEND WHO SPENT THIRTY FIVE YEARS. ON LAPD AND THEY'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THIS BILL ALLOWS THEM TO READ THE BAD APPLES THAT WE KNOW EXIST BAD APPLES THAT WE KNOW EXIST IN EVERY PROFESSION. REGARDS TO THE WALK OF LIFE THAT WE LIVE IN WHERE WE LIVE THERE ARE BAD PEOPLE. AND JUST BECAUSE YOU PUT ON A UNIFORM AND A BADGE DOESN'T. ABSOLVE YOU OR MAKE YOU IMMUNE TO BEING A BAD PERSON AND THAT'S THE REALITY THAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. THAT THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED PROFESSIONS PROFESSIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT YOU CAN LOSE YOUR LICENSE OR BE DECERTIFIED. BECAUSE OF BAD OR ILLEGAL ACTS WE'RE JUST ADDING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THAT CATEGORY OF BEING ABLE TO JOIN THE FORTY SIX OTHER STATES WHO FEEL. JUDGED AND AFTER. A THOROUGH REVIEW OF ACTIONS. POLLINI INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE SHOULD BE DECERTIFIED WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY EXAMPLES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THIS NATION THEY CLEARLY WARRANTS THIS MEASURE TO BE PASSED INTO MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD WHO TALKED ABOUT SPLIT SECTION SECOND. DECISIONS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT MAKE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT WHEN THEY'RE WHITE COMMUNITIES BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BLACK AND BROWN ON ARMED PEOPLE WITH CELL PHONES IN THEIR HANDS THEY WIND UP DEAD. BUT WHEN THEY FACE AND FACE ANGRY WHITE MOBS THEY ALL GO HOME SAFE SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT TRAINING THIS IS ABOUT SOME BIASES THAT CLEARLY EXISTS BIASES THAT CLEARLY EXISTED IN THOSE. THIRTEEN OFFICERS IN TORRENTS OR WALKED OFF THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF RACES HORRIBLE TREATMENT TO CITIZENS THESE INDIVIDUALS DO NOT DESERVE. A UNIFORM THEY DON'T DESERVE THE BACK AND THEY DON'T DESERVE OUR TRUST AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH TRUST IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE ALL WANT. A SAFE COMMUNITY WE ALL WANT GOOD COPS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THIS ALLOWS US TO BE. A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A FIGURE IT IS SEVEN STEPS THAT HAVE TO BE MET. BEFORE OFFICER AGAIN CAN BE THE CERTIFIED OR HAVE THEIR CERTIFICATE SUSPENDED. AND IT IS FAIR AS YOU CAN EVER WISH IT TO BE THE CONTINUE TO THINK JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN A VICTIM OF POLICE BRUTALITY. OR OR SOME KIND OF JUSTICE THAT YOU CAN'T BE FEARED THAT YOU CAN'T BE UNBIASED. TRUST US JUST LIKE YOU **** THE TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT- AGAIN MOST PEOPLE DO NOT HATE COPS THEY FEAR COPS THE PIER COP BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF TRUST. THIS BILL HELPS US ESTABLISH THAT TRUST THAT'S LONG OVERDUE. AND THE SCENE ONE APPLE CAN SPOIL THE WHOLE BUNCH WILL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ONE OUT THE BAD APPLES CAN SPOIL THE WHOLE BUNCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD.

CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM IS ENTIRELY FUNDED BY WORKERS GET THE BENEFITS AREN'T REALISTICALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR MANY LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WHO PAY INTO THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY A WORKER ONLY RECEIVED 6270% OF THEIR INCOME WHILE ON LEAVE FOR UP TO EIGHT WEEKS. THIS MEANS THAT A FULL TIME MINIMUM WAGE WORKER EARNING FOURTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR WOULD STILL ONLY RECEIVE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE FOR ANY MINIMUM WAGE WORKER IN THE COUNTRY. THIS WOULD ONLY PROVIDE THEIR FAMILY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR DOLLARS PER MONTH. BARELY COVERING THE AVERAGE RENT FOR A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. PARENTS ALREADY STRUGGLING TO PAY THE BILLS THE CURRENT WAGE REPLACEMENT RATES ARE INSUFFICIENT AND DON'T PROVIDE ENOUGH TO LIVE ON ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN A FAMILY IS ACTUALLY FACING INCREASED EXPENSES. FROM A NEWBORN OR MEDICAL BILLS FOR SERIOUS ILLNESS THIS HALLMARK PROGRAM WAS CREATED TO AVOID FORCING WORKERS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BEING PRESENT AT HOME TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES IN TIMES OF NEED. AND WORKING TO MAKE ENDS MEET EIGHTY ONE TWO THREE WOULD REQUIRE. PAID FAMILY LEAVE IT'S A IT WOULD BE INSURED PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS A BENEFIT THAT ALL WORKERS CAN ENJOY BY INCREASING THE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE FOR ALL PAID FAMILY LEAVE CLEANS.

AT SOME LEVEL FORTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGAR CURRY AN ACT RELATING TO INDUSTRIAL HEMP AND DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE OF TICKET TO BE DEALING. CENTER OUR THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT THIS- BILL AN AXE A COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY CONSUMER PROTECTION FRAMEWORK. AUTHORIZING THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF NON INTOXICATING HEMP DERIVED PRODUCTS IN FOOD BEVERAGE. DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS FOR PET PRODUCTS AND COSMETICS. ALSO THERE ARE HEMP CBD PRODUCTS THAT ARE ON STORE SHELVES THAT ARE UNREGULATED UNTESTED. ARE THERE NO CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS IN CURRENT LAW PROVIDING ASSURANCES THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE. AFTER THE LAST THREE YEARS OR SO SOME REGULAR CURRY'S WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS PROPOSAL FOR YOU TODAY IT'S A ROBUST CONSUMER SAFETY FRAMEWORK THAT WILL BE ENFORCED. BY THE COVER THE PART OF THE CALIPHATE THAT'S THE PRODUCT OF A HARD WON COMPROMISE. REPRESENTING A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER CALIFORNIA'S REGULATORY. STATUS QUO LET ME JUST MENTION TWO THINGS. OFFERS SOME STAKEHOLDERS- TO SATISFY THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY AUTHORIZE CANNABIS LICENSEES TO ACCESS AND PARTICIPATE IN THE HELP SUPPLY CHAIN. TO BE CLEAR THIS IS SOMETHING THE AUTHOR SUPPORTS UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT A STEP IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS PREPARED TO TAKE AT THIS TIME. BUT THE BILL DOES REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL TO PREPARE A REPORT. BY JULY OF NEXT YEAR OUTLINING THE STEPS NECESSARY TO ALLOW FOR THE CORPORATION OF HEMP PRODUCTS. INTO THE CANNABIS SUPPLY CHAIN. SECONDLY I WANT TO MENTION IS THE RESPONSE. RESPONDING TO CONCERNS RAISED BY FARMERS. SMALL AND LARGE YOU FELT THEY WERE BEING LEFT OUT OF THE BILL. AND WITH WITH THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT THIS BILL WAS RECENTLY AMENDED TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE AT A FUTURE DATE TO PERMIT. THE SALE OF INHALABLE PRINT HEMP PRODUCTS IF IT SO CHOOSES. BUT ONLY IF IT FITS IN ACTS OF TAX ON THE PRODUCTS THEMSELVES- IT'S IN IT'S INACCURATE TO ARGUE THE SALE OF INHALABLE TEMP PRODUCTS WOULD BE PERMITTED TO CALIFORNIA WHERE THAT ATTACKS WOULD BE ENACTED. IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW. IT JUST. IS IT IF THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO THAT LATER BUT THEY'D HAVE TO PROACTIVELY DO IT. SO ON BOTH OF THESE ISSUES MORE DELIBERATION MORE HARD WORK MORE ACTION BY THE LEGISLATURE'S YET TO COME- BUT AFTER THREE YEARS OF DISCUSSION DOZENS OF HOURS OF MEETING IN MUCH PUBLIC DEBATE I HAD A BILL ON THIS TOPIC TOO. THIS MUCH IS CLEAR BY BY PASSING THIS BILL CALIFORNIA WILL REPLACE ALMOST ENTIRELY UNREGULATED. MARKET PLACE WITH A FRAMEWORK THAT INCLUDES ROBUST TESTING LABELING ADVERTISING REGISTRATION RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS. COUPLED WITH CONTENT RESTRICTIONS ABROAD AT THE READY FOR IT DPH. TO ENSURE THAT ANY HEMP PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET PLACE DON'T CAUSE AN INTOXICATING EFFECT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS A BIG AND IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR MYSELF. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. TODAY THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE SIDE OF. HEARING SEEING AND MENTORED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN I ARCHULETA I ATKINS I FACE.

COSTS FOR BUSINESSES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- THE PANDA HAS INCREASED RELIANCE ON TAKE OUT FOOD DELIVERY CONSEQUENTLY THE USE OF SINGLE USE FOOD ACCESSORIES AS CONTRIBUTING APPROXIMATELY USE PLASTICS. AND A 30% INCREASE IN WAYS WHICH OF COURSE IS NOW INCREASING. CONSUMER COSTS AT THE CITY LEVEL RATE COSTS FOR WASTE MANAGEMENT IT'S AFTER. SO I TODAY MANY FOOD FACILITIES AND FOOD DELIVERY SERVICES PROVIDE SINGLE USE FOOD WHERE BEVERAGE ACCESSORIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE NEEDED. MOST CONSUMERS DON'T WANT THEM THEY ALREADY HAVE A REUSABLE ITEMS AT THEIR HOME OR WORKPLACE IS A YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE WOULD TAKE IN THERE.

WITH THESE- ADDITIONAL PLASTIC THIS PLASTIC WHERE THEY DON'T NEED AND SO OFTEN IT'S JUST BEING DISCARDED WITHOUT EVER BEING USED SO. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THIS BILL EXPANDS THE PLASTIC STRAWS UPON REQUEST LAW TO INCLUDE MORE-SINGLE USE FOOD WHERE ACCESSORIES MORE FOOD FACILITIES.

ASSEMBLY BILL TEN NINETY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLLY AND ACTS RELATING TO HOUSING CENTER CARRIER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY 2% AB TEN NINETY FIVE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLLY WHICH CREATES PARITY IN STATE AND LOCAL HOUSING PROGRAMS. HOMEOWNERSHIP CONTRIBUTES TO THE FINANCIAL SECURITY OF FAMILIES AND STABILITY OF COMMUNITIES BY OFFERING STABLE HOUSING COSTS AND INCREASED SAVINGS AND PURCHASING POWER UNFORTUNATELY HOMEOWNERSHIP LEVELS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE THEIR LOWEST SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLORS WHERE OWNERSHIP RATES FALL FAR BELOW THE STATE AVERAGE HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE OF FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. ONE OF THE PRIMARY BARRIERS TO INCREASING AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. IS THE LACK OF AVAILABLE STATE AND LOCAL FUNDING SOURCES TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP DEVELOPERS MANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS SUCH AS HABITAT FOR HUMANITY BUILD DEED RESTRICED HIGH DENSITY INFILL PROJECTS CLOSE TO TRANSIT BUT CONTINUE TO FACE FUNDING BARRIERS BECAUSE PROGRAM SELECTION CRITERIA. OFTEN ONLY CONTEMPLATE RENTAL HOUSING POLICIES. AB TEN NINETY FIVE CREATES A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP PROJECTS BY ALLOWING STATE HOUSING PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE CRITERIA IN THEIR APPLICATION PROCESS FOR BOTH OWNERSHIP AND RENTAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE GUIDELINES IT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP STRENGTHENS COMMUNITIES. STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THE THESE DEVELOPMENTS PROVIDE AND CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD ALLOWING ALL PROJECTS TO COMPETE EQUALLY FOR NECESSARY FUNDING.

ASSEMBLY BILL TEN OH NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM AN ACT RELATING TO AGRICULTURE CENTER KOMAR THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I PRESENT AB. TEN OH NINE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM WHICH ESTABLISHES THE FARM TO COMMUNITY HUB PROGRAM WITHIN THE OFFICE OF FARM TO FORK AND PROPOSES FUNDING FOR A PILOT PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH AT LEAST A THREE FARM TO COMMUNITY FOOD HUBS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FOOD HUBS OFFER A REGIONALIZED APPROACH TO FOOD DISTRIBUTION THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE A SUCCESSFUL MODEL FOR PROMOTING DIRECT FARM AND RANCH SALES TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN THE UNPREDICTABILITY AND LOTS OF MARKETS. WHICH HAS HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S SMALL SCALE FARMERS. DURING THE PANDEMIC THOSE AREAS THAT HAD COMMUNITY FACING FOOD HUB WERE ABLE TO PIVOT QUICKLY TOWARD RE DIRECTING THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS TO AREAS OF NEED. THE FIRM TO COMMUNITY FOOD HAVE CREATED UNDER THIS BILL WILL PRIORITIZE AGGREGATION AND DISTRIBUTION FROM FARMS AND RANCHES THAT- COOPERATIVELY OWNED OPERATING ON FIVE HUNDRED ACRES OR LESS WERE OWNED BY SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED BEGINNING LIMITED RESOURCE VETERANS MINORITY OR DISABLED FARMERS AND RANCHERS. TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THE BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. ON A. B. TEN OH NINE. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. WE HAVE CENTER JONES. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SOME DETAILS IN THE BILL- AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE FLOOR MANAGER QUESTION REGARDING THE INTENT OF SOME OF THE LANGUAGE FROM THE AUTHOR IN THE ASSEMBLY. SENATOR COME ARE WE ENTERTAIN A QUESTION. YES THE TERRORIST CENTER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT YOUR PRESIDENT- THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT STATES. PARTICIPATING FARMERS AND RANCHERS MUST COMPLY. WITH ALL LOCAL ALL LAWS RULES AND REGULATIONS WHICH SEEMS TO IMPLY. THAT CALIFORNIA FARMERS RANCHERS- ARE NOT CURRENTLY COMPLYING WITH- FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. AND SO IS THAT THE IMPLICATION THAT THE AUTHOR IN THE ASSEMBLY IS TRYING TO MAKE WITH THIS LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. TO- TALK JUST WA YES I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION FROM THE GOOD SENATOR FROM STAND T. THE ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THE FLOOR MANAGER LOVE FARMS AND FARMERS. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT- THAT FARMERS AND RANCHERS DO NOT COMPLY WITH STATE LAW. BECAUSE THE FARM TO COMMUNITY FOOD HUBS WILL BE ACCEPTING GRANT DOLLARS FROM THE STATE THE PROVISION- THAT'S BEING REFERENCED INSURES THAT THE FARMS AND RANCHES. WITH WHICH THE FOOD HUB WILL BE WORKING ARE IN GOOD STANDING FARM BUREAUS FLOOR ALERT REFERENCES A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE BILL CITING FAIR LABOR PRACTICES THAT LANGUAGE HAS SINCE BEEN AMENDED OUT OF THE BILL AND INSTEAD NOW READS FARMS AND RANCHES FOLLOWING STATE LABOR PRACTICES. WHICH IS CLEARLY IN LINE WITH THE STATE'S GOALS AND VALUES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THE FOOD HAVE OPERATORS WHO RECEIVE GRANTS WILL ENSURE THAT THE SUPPLIERS THEY WORK WITH COMPLY WITH-STATE LAW. IT CAN BE PART OF THEIR GRANT APPLICATION TO SHOW HOW THEY INTEND TO DO THIS THEY COULD FOR EXAMPLE MONITOR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASES OR EVEN CONTRACT WITH A THIRD PARTY TO DO SO. AGAIN THIS REQUEST IS GUIDANCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE GRANT PROGRAM BUT DOES NOT IMPOSE ANY REGULATORY BURDEN ON ANY ENTITY. IS THAT SATISFY THE QUESTIONER JR THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I DO APPRECIATE THE FOUR MANAGERS VERY DETAILED AND ARTICULATED ANSWER TO MY QUESTION. I DO HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL I'LL BE LAYING OFF TODAY- BUT CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE CONCEPT AND THE IDEA BEHIND THE BILL AND APPRECIATE THE FLOOR MANAGERS PROFESSIONALS AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS HERE. SENATOR MELINDA BUSH. THANK YOU- I NEED TO HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS AND HAVE A QUESTION OF THE FLOOR MANAGER IF I MAY SAY- COME OVER WE TAKE QUESTIONS. S. H. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO- A COUPLE THINGS IN THE BILL ONE. IT TALKS ABOUT THOSE BEING ELIGIBLE AS BEING SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGE AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD PROVIDE A DEFINITION OF WHAT SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED MEANS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS BILL. SO SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED. CAN MEAN- FARMERS OF COLOR IT CAN MEAN FARMERS WHO- ARE CONSIDERED LOW INCOME- THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES I'M SURE YOU MIGHT HAVE OTHER CONCERNS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAN ELABORATE ON THAT ANSWER. WHILE YOU ASK ANOTHER QUESTION. I HAVE- JUST TWO QUESTIONS BUT THE YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT THAT HAS CONFOUNDED ME A BIT IT IS THE DEFINITION OF SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE FROM- THE ANALYSIS THAT I HAVE READ AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THE QUESTION PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPAND ON IT PERHAPS I'M WRONG BUT FROM THE ANALYSIS THAT I'VE READ. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED- RELATES TO- AN ETHNIC SORT OF BAD A BENCHMARK IN OTHER WORDS IT'S PARTICULARLY RELATED TO RACE AND I'M JUST CURIOUS- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD PUT SOMEONE IN THE CATEGORY- FOR SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED WITH RESPECT TO THESE FARMERS. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO IN THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE OF THE BILL IT DOES NOT SPECIFY THAT RACE WOULD BE A DETERMINING FACTOR. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT WOULD BE ALLOWABLE UNDER THE LAW BUT SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED CAN ALSO MEAN IF YOU ARE A VETERAN IF YOU ARE DISABLED. IF YOU HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES. WITH WHICH TO- CONTINUE TO PRODUCE ON YOUR FARM SO THOSE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES THAT ALSO- HELP TO HOPEFULLY DEFINE WHAT SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED. MEANS I KNOW THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR RESIDENT FARMER ON THE SENATE FLOOR WHO TALKS ABOUT HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO MAINTAIN YOUR FARMLAND AND THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. THAT'S YOU SENATOR. FROM A CLOUD- ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS DEFINITION. RACE IS NOT- IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. OKAY SO THEN THERE IS- I WILL GO BACK AND LOOK AT IT THERE IS A DEFINITION PROVIDED WITHIN THE BILL AS TO WHAT SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGES IS THAT CORRECT. IT IS- ACTUALLY ON PAGE FIVE OF THE BILL AND IT IS ONE OF THE- LISTED CRITERIA. AND THEY DO GIVE EXAMPLES OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN- I FOR MY FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE IF THERE IS ANY CONCERN- GIVEN THAT WE ARE ON A FEDERAL LEVEL YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME- ISSUE AND SOME. LITIGATION RELATING TO. FUNDING GIVEN TO DISADVANTAGED- FARMERS WITH RESPECT TO COVERT RELIEF AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS CHALLENGED IN COURT AS BEING UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT WASN'T OFFERED TO- EVERYONE IN THE FARMING COMMUNITY JUSTIN CURIOUS IF THERE'S CONCERNS WITH THE SPELL THAT THAT. MIGHT FALL INTO THE SAME CATEGORY. I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL THE LANGUAGE IN AB TEN OH NINE DOES PROVIDE DIRECTION TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO AWARD. THOSE GRANTS TO THOSE FOOD HUBS- THAT SHOW HOW THEY WILL BE FINANCIALLY SELF SUFFICIENT AND SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TRAPS HAVE BEEN RUN AS IT RELATES TO THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT RUNS PARALLEL WITH STATE. AND FEDERAL LAWS. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CLARITY. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION QUESTIONS OR DEBATE AS IT RELATES TO FALL ITEM ONE FORTY. HEARING AND SEEING NO OTHER DISCUSSIONS SENATOR TOM ARE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I JUST WANNA THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR QUESTIONS BECAUSE- I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S GREAT TO- HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON AND THE FARMERS THAT WORK IN OUR STATE AND PROVIDE US ACCESS TO GREAT- FOOD AND VEGETABLES AND SUSTENANCE- AND ASK THAT YOU ALL WILL SUPPORT.

CENTER WINNER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT OUR COLORS ARE RISING PERCENT AB THIRTEEN NINETY EIGHT ON BEHALF OF SOME REMEMBER BLOOM. THIS BILL MAY LOOK FAMILIAR TO YOU COLLEAGUES- WE BECAUSE I AUTHORED IT LAST YEAR AND WE PASSED IT OUT OF THE HOUSE OF ORIGIN ON AND UNFORTUNATELY I YOU MAY RECALL THOSE WILL TURMOIL AT THE END OF. A SESSION WE HAD A RESUME SITUATION WE HAD- SOME DISPUTES WITH THE OTHER HOUSE- AND- UNFORTUNATELY- THE BILL DID NOT TAKE A BACK. POCKET CURRENCY UNTIL. THE CLOCK STRUCK MIDNIGHT A LITTLE BITE WAS SONG AND THE SESSION WENT INTO A DEEP SLEEP- SO SUMMER BLOOM HAS BROUGHT THIS BILL BACK AND A. B. THIRTEEN NINETY EIGHT PROVIDES. THAT A JURISDICTION THAT HAS FAILED TO ADOPT AN EIGHT CITY APPROVES HOUSING ELEMENT. BY THE STATUTORY DEADLINE MUST COMPLETE A REZONING PROGRAM WITHIN ONE YEAR. CURRENTLY HAVE A JURISDICTION DOES NOT ADOPT THE HOUSING ELEMENT BY THE STATUTORY DEADLINE YOU MUST ADOPT A REVISED HOUSING ELEMENT EVERY FOUR YEARS RATHER THAN EVERY EIGHT THIS PENALTY FOR NONCOMPLIANCE- HAS PROVEN EFFECTIVE AND WEEKENDS HOUSING ELEMENT LAW. FOR EXAMPLE UNDER CURRENT LAW A CITY OR COUNTY CAN THE DOCTOR LEGALLY DEFICIENT HOUSING ELEMENTS ALMOST FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE STATUTORY DEADLINE WITH NO CONSEQUENCES. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS ADOPT ELEMENT- WAS NOT REVISED TO CORRECT THE LEGAL DEFICIENCIES FOR MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE DEADLINE AND SOME EGREGIOUS CASES IT WASN'T CORRECTED FOR YEARS IF EVER. BY AB THIRTEEN NINETY EIGHT SIX TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY SHORTENING THE TIME PERIOD. IN WHICH. EARNING IT STRENGTHENS HOUSING ELEMENT LAW AND INSURERS- THAT THIS PROCESS HAS MEANING I RESPECTFULLY ASK HERE I GO. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT HAVING SERVED TO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE CITY AND COUNTY- IN A SMALLER- COMMUTING CALIFORNIA- COMPARED TO SOME OF THE COASTAL CITIES I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS. BEYOND BURDENSOME. WELL A LEGALLY COMPLIANT. THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS SOMETHING THAT IS EXPECTED BUT IT SOUNDS MUCH EASIER SAID THAN DONE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT DEALING WITH OUR HOUSING ISSUE IT'S NOT PUNISHING THE LOCAL FOLKS IN SO FAR AS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE BIG BROADER STROKES AFFECTING OUR SHORTAGE THAT INCLUDE SEQUEL REFORM. SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE GONE THROUGH PLENTY OF SEQUEL EXEMPTION SYKORA BYPASSES IN SYNC WITH STREAMLINES WHICH I THINK IS A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT BUT WE'RE DANCING AROUND ONE OF THE BIGGEST WHITE ELEPHANTS IN THE ROOM SO IMPOSING THIS OBLIGATION TO CITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SUCH A PUNITIVE FASHION. I THINK IS REALLY A TESTAMENT OF ALREADY IN ACTION AT THE STATE LEVEL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING IN SCENA NINE CENTER WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- TO MY COLLEAGUE I WILL SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS AUTHORED VARIOUS HOUSING SYKORA- STREAMLINING EXEMPTION PIECE OF LEGISLATION THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING- THE LATEST ON A CRUISE SHIP THAT- I TOTALLY AGREE THAT HOUSING ON THE BY ITSELF IS NOT. GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH IS A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO- AND- I KNOW WE WORK LIKE COLLABORATIVE WAY CROSS THE AISLE- IN THIS BODY TO TRY TO MOVE FORWARD GOOD HOUSING LEGISLATION- BUT THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS- AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROCESS AND IT IT HIM IN EMPOWERS FRANKLY CITIES EVERY YEAR IS TO- COME UP WITH A PLANNING DOCUMENT SAY THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEET OUR HOUSING. GOALS AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROCESS EVEN THOUGH IT CAN BE PAINFUL- POLITICALLY BUT IT FORCES THAT KIND OF DISCIPLINE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR MANY YEARS THE HOUSING ON A PROCESS WHERE IT WAS JUST AT TIMES IT WAS A JOKE- THERE'S NO CONSEQUENCES FOR EITHER BLOWING IT OFF OR FOR HAVING. JUST REALLY UNREALISTIC ITEMS WITHIN THE HOUSING ELEMENT THAT THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO GET BUILT AND SO WE'RE FINALLY GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE STRENGTHENING AND CLOSING LOOPHOLES AND I DO THINK THIS IS PART OF THAT SO.

FOR YEARS OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM CAL GRANT HAS BEEN OUTDATED OVERLY COMPLEX AND EXCLUSIONARY FOR MOST UNDERSERVED STUDENTS THE PANDEMIC HAS ONLY WORSENED THE INEQUALITIES TO ACCESSING AFFORDABLE HIGHER EDUCATION. THIS YEAR THE BUDGET MADE SIGNIFICANT STEPS AND MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND ATTAINABLE TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND EXPANDING ACCESS TO MIDDLE CLASS STUDENTS EVENSO THE STATE CANNOT ACHIEVE ITS GOALS OF TIMELY DEGREE COMPLETION AND DEBT FREE COLLEGE WITHOUT MAKING SURE THAT OUR STATE FINANCIAL AID RESOURCES. COVER THE TOTAL COST OF EDUCATION TUITION AND FEES AS WELL AS HOUSING AND BASIC NEEDS A. B. FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX FINALLY ADDRESSES THESE CHALLENGES BY ENACTING SEVERAL NECESSARY REFORMS IT REMOVED ALL ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS TO CAL GRANT SIMPLIFIES AND MODERNIZES THE PROGRAM. ALIGNS A STATE WITH FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THIS BILL IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THE BUDGET ACT BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE JOB WE GET THE JOB DONE FOR ALL STUDENTS. THIS IS A POLICY THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA AND I. N. A SUMMER PARTY HAVE CHAMPIONED BOWL IN THE BUDGET AND LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS AND I AM PROUD TO BRING THIS FINAL PRODUCT TO YOU TODAY. MOREOVER WE HAVE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH STUDENTS OUR UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE ACTUALLY GET THIS RIGHT THIS IS A HISTORICAL YEAR OF INVESTMENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD MAKE THIS THE YEAR WE FINALLY CREATE A PATH.

THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT QUESTION THE AUTHOR. SENATOR WOULD YOU TAKE LEVEL WOULD YOU TAKE QUESTION I WOULD LOVE A QUESTION. SENATOR BREAUX THE INJURED DURING THEIR ROLES CONFIRMATION HEARING OF SOME OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD MEMBERS WE RECENTLY TALKED ABOUT A FRAUD SCAM THAT HAS PENETRATED OUR- COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS ON THE GRANT PROGRAM DO YOU THINK THE BILL SHOULD ADDRESS ANYTHING ABOUT. THE GRANTS THAT ARE BEING- THE GRANTS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN UP BY WHAT THEY CALL BOT STUDENT CENTER WILL STUDENTS THAT ARE APPLYING FOR GRANT FUNDING THEY WERE OVER. THERE WERE SEVERAL COLLEGES THAT HAD IDENTIFIED A MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS THAT WENT TO WHAT THEY CALLED BOTS OR NONEXISTENT STUDENTS AND I KNOW THE BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT BUT I WAS JUST CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. SO SINCE IT IS TOO LATE TO AMEND THE BILL IF THAT IS ACTUALLY A REAL PROBLEM WE SHOULD DEFINITELY ADDRESS THAT WHEN WE COME BACK IN JANUARY THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM OF THE GRANTS. AT THE GRANT SCAMS THAT WE HAVE GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT I SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL PART OF THE INLAND EMPIRE CAUCUS IT'S MY HONOR TO BE A PART OF THAT CAUCUS. AND IT'S THIS IS A VERY GOOD BILL TO MOVE FORWARD BUT WE DO REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH GRANTS AND BEING DISPERSED TO- INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NOT REALLY STUDENTS AND THAT ARE IN ROLE TAKING UP SPACE IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN ACCESSING RESOURCES. THIS A BODY APPROPRIATE SINCE THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME MAKE THOSE COMMENTS. THANK YOU CENTERMAN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE PRESENTER- WE KNOW THAT. HIGHER EDUCATION IS AT THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND AS A FORMER UC PROFESSOR MYSELF I KNOW THAT TOO MANY OF OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND POST GRAD STUDENTS- STRUGGLE WITH THE STRESS OF STUDENT DEBT- I AM I CAN'T BECAUSE MY WIFE AND I JUST PAID OFF OUR STUDENT DID A FEW YEARS AGO. AND STUDENT DEBT LOADS ARE RISING DRAMATICALLY DUE THE RISING COST OF TUITION. AND ALL THE FEES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COLLEGE SO. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO DEBT FREE COLLEGE THIS BILL TAKES A HUGE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION BY RECOGNIZING THAT TUITION. IS ONLY ONE PART OF THE BIG MUCH BIGGER PICTURES FOR STUDENT COSTS INTO STUDENT. POTENTIAL DEBT OVERLOAD- YOU KNOW PEOPLE TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT COLLEGES SOME KIND OF. ASPIRATIONAL GREEN THAT CAN OCCUR. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THAT WE ACTUALLY STARTED IMPLEMENTING TUITION AND ARE YOU SEASONS YES USE.

WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ITEMS HERE AND FIRST UP IS FILE ITEM. TWENTY SIX. FILE I AM TWENTY SIX SENATOR ALAN ARE YOU PREPARED FOR YOUR- UNFINISHED BUSINESS. M. SECRETARY PLEASE ROUTE SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION ONE BY SENATOR ALAN RELATIVE TO STUDENT LOAN DEBT. CHIRALA. MEMBERS LAST YEAR ONE CALLS ON PRESIDENT BIDEN TO FORGET FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR STUDENT BORROWERS ACROSS THE NATION- THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS RISING WE NEED TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE A MANUFACTURER WHERE THEY WANT TO OPEN THEIR OWN SMALL BUSINESS WHERE THEY WANNA BE A COWBOY. LET'S LET'S PASS THIS YEAR WENT BY FAST TRAVEL. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR DOLLAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO STAND UP IN OPPOSITION. I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS OUT THERE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF DEBT IN AMERICA. AS YOU KNOW THE NATIONAL DEBT IS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN AMERICA WHY SHOULD WE SETTLE THEM WITH MORE DEBT WHEN THEY WERE THE ONES THAT GOT THE EDUCATION. MAKES NO SENSE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I'M ALSO OPPOSE THE BILL BIT MORE. MAYBE AT A THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL I'M I'M KIND OF CONFUSED BY THE CONVERSATION IS TAKING PLACE IN AMERICA TODAY. THAT THERE'S THIS PUSH FOR. THE GOVERNMENT TO FORGIVE THE STUDENT LOANS. WHEN IT'S- STUDENTS. UNDER THE DIRECTION OR WITH COUNSEL WITH THEIR PARENTS- ADULTS THAT ARE TAKING THIS OBLIGATION UPON THEMSELVES FRELY. THEY'RE PURSUING EDUCATION AND A VERY HIGH EXPENSE THAT SOMETIMES COMES WITH A HIGH PAYING JOB OR SOMETIMES DOESN'T. BUT THERE'S NO COERCION- TO REQUIRE SOMEBODY TAKE THIS DEAD UPON THEMSELVES AND IN CALIFORNIA AS A MATTER OF FACT IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE TO GET A HIGH QUALITY FOUR YEAR DEGREE FROM EITHER THE CSU SYSTEM OR THE UC SYSTEM AND GRADUATE WITH LITTLE OR NO. DEBT 30% OF AMERICANS GO TO COLLEGE. AND PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION. IF WE FORGIVE THESE LOANS IT'S TAXPAYER MONEY IT'S AMERICAN OTHER AMERICAN DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO PAY OFF THAT DEBT. WHY IS IT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE 70% OF AMERICANS THAT DON'T GO TO COLLEGE TO PAY FOR THE COLLEGE EDUCATION OF THE THIRTY PERCENT. THAT DO GO TO COLLEGE. MEMBERS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE COME BACK TO THESE CHAMBERS IN A MORE CREATIVE FASHION NEXT YEAR. AND FIND A WAY TO HOLD THE COLLEGES ACCOUNTABLE THEY'RE PUTTING THE CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS INTO THIS DEBT. I SEE CHILDREN ACTUALLY TOLD BY THE TIME THEY GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE SO THEY'RE ADULTS- TAKING ON THIS BURDEN. WHAT WHY DON'T WE FIND A WAY TO REMOVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE PROCESS OF EVEN- SUPPORTING THESE LOANS IN THE FIRST CASE IN THE FIRST PLACE. A LOT OF THESE HIGHER EDUCATION. INSTITUTIONS HAVE HUGE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ENDOWMENTS. WHY DON'T WE REQUIRE THE COLLEGES. TO BACK UP THESE LOANS WITH% THEIR ENDOWMENT RATHER THAN WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS I URGE A NO VOTE ON SJR ONE.THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR MELINDA THANK YOU SO MUCH- I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR IF I MAY. GENERAL YOU TAKE YOUR QUESTION TO HAVE ANSWERED IF YOU HAPPY TOO THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M SO CENTER I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF THERE IS- IS THERE A LIMITATION TO. WHO THIS WOULD APPLY TO ANOTHER WORDS AND SUGGEST FROM A DATE CERTAIN GOING FORWARD DOES THIS APPLY TO SAY SOMEBODY WHO GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND IS THERE SOME SORT OF LIMITATION OR IS THIS APPLY TO EVERYONE. SO THIS IS THIS IS THIS APPLIES TO EVERYONE WHO HAS IT IS FOR IS- EXISTING STUDENT LOAN DEBT THIS IS THE- THE PROPOSAL THAT IS CURRENTLY BEFORE CONGRESS. OKAY AND DOES IT APPLY ONLY IF YOU WENT TO A STATE SCHOOL OR IS IT- PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AS WELL. WITH BOTH. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE QUESTIONS I'M ON MY OWN TIME I JUST WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT THAT- YOU KNOW EVERY MEMBER OF THIS SENATE WHO'S ATTENDED COLLEGE PERHAPS YOU WENT TO PRIVATE UNIVERSITY- PERHAPS YOU INTO A VERY EXPENSIVE UNIVERSITY OR PERHAPS. YOU ARE WELL EQUIPPED TO PAY BACK YOUR STUDENT LOANS- YOU MAY HAVE CHOSEN TO DO SO OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THAT. WE WOULD ALL BE ELIGIBLE TO HAVE THIS SUBJECT HE RAISED EVEN THOUGH WE ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF PAYING IT NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT YOU COULD GO BACK. YOU KNOW MANY I MEAN DECADES IF SOMEBODY IS. EXTENDING THIS LOAN OUT OVER YOU KNOW TEN FIFTEEN YEARS PERHAPS LONGER YOU ARE ERASING FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT FOR SOMEBODY WHO COULD YOU KNOW VERY WELL AFFORD TO PAY IT BACK RATHER THAN ASKING THOSE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM C. N. T. MENTION WHO MAY HAVE NEVER ATTENDING COLLEGE. AND ASK THEM TO PAY FOR THE COLLEGE EDUCATION OF SOMEONE WHO IS CERTAINLY ABLE TO PAY FOR IT THEMSELVES SO I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION A VASE INTERNAL MAW. MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE S. J. R. ONE AS SOMEONE WHO SPENT ELEVEN YEARS WORKING WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS- I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT DEATH DOESN'T NECESSARILY- IS NOT LIMITED TO UNDER 500-005-0000 I WOULD NEED STUDENTS THAT THROUGHOUT THEIR EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY WOULD HIT YOUR DEBT UP TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HAND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DEBT RELIEF TO STUDENTS SOME OF THE FAMILIES THAT ARE GOING TO MOST BENEFIT FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS ARE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. ARE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES IN THIS STATE WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE LOW INCOME STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR AND WHO DON'T HAVE FAMILIES THAT CAN JUST WRITE A CHECK FOR THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF COLLEGE IN THE ELEVEN YEARS I SPENT WORKING WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE I ALSO SAW THAT- MANY STUDENTS WHILE TRYING TO JUGGLE A JOB. AND HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS RAPID INCREASE OF TUITION FEES BOOKS HOUSING AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH A COLLEGE UNIVERSITY WITH A GRADUATE UNIVERSITY SO I% THINK THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS VERY MEANINGFUL AND I DON'T WANT US TO LOSE SIGHT THAT EVERYONE BENEFITS FROM THIS LOWER DEATH BENEFITS- ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT UP TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT STUDENTS OR THEIR FAMILIES WILL PUT IN THEIR PORTION. IT MEANS THAT THIS IS A TYPE OF RELIEF IF YOU READ THAT STR EIGHT UP TO RIGHT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S A TYPE OF RELIEF THAT BENEFITS THEM BENEFITS OUR COMMUNITY OUR ECONOMY AND ALLOWS FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF A COLLEGE AND GRADUATE DEGREE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BROKE. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER OUR CULTURE. MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION- THESE ARE OLD TIRED ARGUMENTS AGAINST RELIEVER RELIEVING. STUDENT DEBT THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR FIFTY YEARS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. NOT THAT FAR LONG AGO. ANY PERSON IN THE UNITED STATES COULD GO INTO BANKRUPTCY COURT AND GET THEIR FEDERALLY GUARANTEED LOANS. OR THEIR PROPERTY PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS DISCHARGED THE BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE THEY MADE A SHOWING THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO PAY BACK THE DEBT. AND IF SOMETHING UNFORTUNATE HAPPENED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS MAGICALLY WE SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCHARGE FEDERALLY STUDENT LOANS BECAUSE HIS ARGUMENT THAT. THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO PAY BACK OR PEOPLE HAVE TO. HAVE RESPONSE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY BUT- WE CUT OFF THAT. AVENUE THE PEOPLE HAD TO DISCHARGE THEIR STUDENT LOANS YOU CAN MARK YOUR CALENDAR IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN PEOPLE STARTED ACCUMULATING IT DOESN'T WORK IT WASN'T WHAT PEOPLE RAN IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. DISCHARGED IF THEY NEEDED TO HAVE THE RELIEF THEY HAD AN OPTION. AND IN THE END WE STILL- WE STILL- PRIDE OURSELVES IN HAVING PEOPLE HAVING ACCESS TO EDUCATION IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THAT PROBLEM GOT WORSE BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE CHANGES TO THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY CODE RICK ALLOW THAT PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN BANK OF AMERICA WELLS FARGO EVERY BANK IN THE WORLD COULD GIVE YOU A PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE DESTRUCTIBLE FOR EVER FOR EVER YOU WERE STUCK WITH IT IT IS A TRAGEDY THAT THAT IS THE LAW OF THE LAND IN THE UNITED STATES THE PEOPLE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURTS. AND SEEK RELIEF TO RELIEVE THAT SO WHAT YOU HAVE NOW IS THE NUMBERS GO UP A TRILLION A TRILLION FOUR TRILLION FIVE AND ALL THIS RESOLUTION DOES IT SAY LET'S GIVE SOME RELIEF SOME AVENUE FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T PAY BACK THE MONEY WHO CAN'T PAY BACK THE MONEY IN THE ACCESS IT'S A TIRED ARGUMENT IT'S A IT'S NOT FOUNDED IN IN ANY OF THE ACADEMIC JOURNALS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THIS OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO CHANGE AND I WOULD URGE. THE RESOLUTION HERE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CAN JOIN IN THE CHORUS- VOICES SAYING WE NEED TO GIVE THE STUDENTS SOME RELIEF AND I REGION EVER. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONS VADER JUST DISCUSSION THIS ITEM SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. YES SOONER- YOU TO QUESTION ABSOLUTELY THROUGH THE CHAIR DO YOU THINK THAT THIS CHARGING AND CURRENT DEBT WOULD CREATE A BUTTERFLY EFFECT. FOR THE FUTURE. HI IF YES THROUGH THE CHAIR I DO BELIEVE IT WOULD CREATE A BUTTERFLY EFFECT IN THE SENSE THAT BYE BYE HOPING STUDENTS OUT WITH THEIR DAD. IT WILL MAKE IT SO THEY'LL BE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO START A BUSINESS TO BUY A HOME TO GET THEIR LIVES ON MOVING. THE FACT THE MATTER IS ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SO MANY OF US AND THE NEXT GENERATION IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT THE NEXT GENERATION IS STARTING TO ACCRUE JUST TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO HAVE A HIGHER EDUCATION IS SO MUCH HIGHER. THAN IT EVER WAS BEFORE AND IN THE END OF THE DAY THAT IS WHAT'S MAKING IT SO DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO REALLY START THEIR LIVES AND PROVIDE THE KIND OF ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO OUR ECONOMY INTO OUR SOCIETY THAT WE- THAT WE THAT WE WANT THEM TO PROVIDE WHEN WE WHEN WE WENT WHEN WE SENT THEM TO COLLEGE IN THE FIRST PLACE JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE AVERAGE GRAD HAD NINETY THREE THOUSAND. THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF DEBT NOW IT'S OVER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH THE SALARIES HAVE ONLY GONE UP. A LITTLE BIT SINCE THEN I'M SO THAT WOULD BE THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT RIGHT THE FACT THAT THIS THIS- THIS THIS IMPACT- BY BY BY BY GIVING MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THESE YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO'VE ACCRUED SO MUCH THAT. IT WILL OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO REINVEST IN GAYS IN OUR ECONOMY BUILD LIVES BUILD BUSINESSES. AND- AND GIVE BACK TO OUR SOCIETY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR SPONSOR. THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT IS A SMALL CHANGE NOW WHICH READ RESULTS IN A DRASTIC CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. AND I THINK THAT THIS SMALL CHANGE NOW TO DISCHARGE COLLEGE DEBT- IS GOING TO DRASTICALLY HURT US IN THE FUTURE FINANCIALLY IN THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE- THE SAME THING THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE SAID. THAT YOU KNOW THE INDIVIDUALS THAT GRADUATE WITH THE TURN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR DEBT- I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS- WORKING ON A DOUBLE LOT AGREE THAT. A LOT A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IS SOMETHING ELSE AND- SHE ACTUALLY HAS A JOB WITH SPACEX AND MAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY TO DISCHARGE THAT DEBT. WOULD JUST BE- NOT RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING IN ORDER TO BE- INVESTED. AND SO I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU SENATOR TODDLE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- NOT TOO LONG AGO AT NOT TOO LONG AGO MAYBE A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS A SENIOR AT CAL STATE SACRAMENTO AND JUST ABOUT MY SENIOR YEAR OF COLLEGE- WE HAVE THE DOWNTURN OF THE ECONOMY AND THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS. AND THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT THE IN THE DOWNTURN OF THE ECONOMY HAD REAL IMPACTS ON ON MY FAMILY AND ON MY EDUCATION. I WAS THE FIRST TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND MY FAMILY BUT ALSO THE FIRST TO ATTEND AND GRADUATE FROM- A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY AND IN MY FAMILY. AND I'LL SAY THAT. I DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FILE- MY STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR BANKRUPTCY WHEN I DID SO MY SENIOR YEAR IN COLLEGE I MEAN I HAD TO. MAKE SURE TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND HELP MY FAMILY THAT. TOOK ON CREDIT CARD DEBT. AND THIS IS A STORY OF MANY STUDENTS IN MY GENERATION AND- THAT NOT ONLY HAD TO DEAL WITH ONE RECESSION ANOTHER HAVING TO DEAL WITH TOO ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S- STILL HAVE A LOT OF DEBT. AND THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF. EVERYTHING FROM BUYING A HOME TO BUYING A CAR TO EVEN APPLY UNDER BRENT BRENT AT THE DEPARTMENT. IT'S THIS HERE ACTUALLY IN JULY IT'S BEEN OFFICIALLY TEN YEARS SINCE I FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY AS A STUDENT. AND IT HAS GOTTEN IN THE WAY OF SO MANY THINGS AND OF ECONOMIC. SUCCESS FOR ME- SO I THINK THAT THIS THIS THIS RESOLUTION IS GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY SENT MESSAGE. OUT TO THE STATION TO THE STATE- TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF ARE NOT GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE SUPPORTED AT THE WORKING TO FIND A SOLUTION TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AT. LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAVAL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THE SIDE OF. HEARING SEEN NINE SENATOR ALAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I REALLY WANT TO THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SINGER FOR. FOR BRINGING UP WHAT EXACTLY IS AT THE HEART OF THIS THIS RESOLUTION I MEAN THE END OF THE DAY FOLKS WHO COME FROM FAMILIES WITH RESOURCES DON'T HAVE TO ACCRUE A LOT OF COLLEGEDEBT THEIR FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO PAY FOR THEM TO GO TO COLLEGE- IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING CLASS PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ACHIEVE. ACCESS TO UPWARD MOBILITY IN OUR SOCIETY AXES WHICH IS ONLY PROVIDED BY A COLLEGE DEGREE. WHO HAVE TO STRETCH AND STRAIN TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD A BASIC COLLEGE OUR KIDS EDUCATION AND- FRANKLY THIS IS NOT SOMETHING. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT PREVIOUS GENERATIONS HAD TO DEAL WITH. I JUST ISN'T OVER CASKEY MENTIONED. PREVIOUS GENERATIONS- THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION WITH HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED. BY THE GOVERNMENT. AND OUR PARTNERS IN OTHER COUNTRIES COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL HAVE RECOGNIZED. HOW MUCH VALUE. THEIR SOCIETY GAINS BYE BYE BY INVESTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND MAKING IT SO THAT. STUDENTS CAN GO TO COLLEGE. ARE VIRTUALLY FOR FREE. BECAUSE THEY REALIZE HOW MUCH BENEFIT THERE IS FOR THEIR BROADER SOCIETY FOR THEIR ECONOMY. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET HIGHLY TRAINED THEY CAN GO INTO THE WORKFORCE THAT CAN BUILD BUSINESSES THEY CAN BE PRODUCTIVE. INSTEAD HERE IN OUR COUNTRY OVER TIME WE HAVE DECIDED TO SHIFT MORE AND MORE OF A NORM IS DEAD BIRD INTO YOUNG PEOPLE. AND IT'S HARMING OUR ECONOMY AND IT'S ALSO EXACERBATING UNFAIRNESS. I TRY NOT TO BE- I TURN OUT TO BE A PARTISAN PERSON BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL AS THOUGH A LOT OF OUR FRIENDS IN THE SIDE OF THE AISLE ARE WILLING TO SUBSIDIZE. SO MANY ASPECTS OF OUR ECONOMY. AND SO MANY-CORPORATE INTERESTS- WHEN WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO GET. ACCESS TO THE AMERICAN DREAM. AN OPPORTUNITY. TO GET THAT ACCESS TO GET THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION. AND TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T SETTLE THEM OF A LIFETIME. OF DEBT BURDEN WHICH MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER FOR THEM TO GET THEIR- FEET ON THE GROUND. BY A HOME RACE THE FAMILY BUILDING BUSINESS AND BE PRODUCTIVE THAT'S WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS ALL ABOUT. MEMBERS THIS IS ABOUT FAIRNESS IS ABOUT ACCESS THIS IS ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT. SADDLED WITH THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF DEBT FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET A COLLEGE DEGREE SO I'M WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS- TRADITIONALLY THIS IS THE ANNUAL STATE BAR FEE BILL WHICH IS NOT PARTICULARLY CONTROVERSIAL BUT SOMETHING HAS CHANGED THIS YEAR ONE THE HOUSEWIVES OF BEVERLY HILLS AND TO TOM GIRARDI- IT IS AS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN. THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES CONCERNING THE INVESTIGATORY ABILITY AND DILIGENCE OF THE STATE BAR AND THEN ALL KIDDING ASIDE THAT WAS EXPOSED THROUGH THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE BAKUL OF TIME GIRARDI AND IN HIS LAW FIRM- IT WAS APPARENT THAT. THERE HAD BEEN HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE VICTIMIZED OVER THE COURSE OF MANY MANY YEARS VICTIMIZED ONCE FOR EXAMPLE AS THE VICTIMS OF A PLANE CRASH OR SOME OTHER HUGE TRAGEDY THEN SECONDLY. BY LAWYERS WHO STOLE THEIR SETTLEMENT. AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THERE WAS AN AUDIT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN SHARED WITH US BUT THIS BILL PROVIDES FOR STATE AUDIT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT THERE HAD NOT BEEN A CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL IN OTHER WORDS THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. IN THE STATE BAR FOR FIVE YEARS IN THE BILL REGIONALLY SAID AFTER HIS MODIFIED THAT THERE BE NO BAR DUES UNTIL THE STATE BAR NOMINATES THE CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL TO FILL THAT ROLE.
