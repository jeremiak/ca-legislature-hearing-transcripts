SUB COMMITTEE CENTER PORTANTINO YOU'LL BE PRESENTING SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT AND WE'RE HEARING THIS BILL PURSUANT TO SENATE RULE TWENTY NINE POINT TEN D. BECAUSE IT WAS OF SIX OF STATE ACTUALLY AMENDED WELL IN THE- ASSEMBLY. SO PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU A MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY I AM PROUD TO PRESENT SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE GLENDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE'S GOVERNING BOARD. PURSUANT TO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TO PROVIDE THAT APRIL TWENTY FOURTH SHELBY GLENDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS HOLIDAY KNOWN AS ARMENIAN GENOCIDE REMEMBRANCE DAY. GLENDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SERVES A CITY AND A REGION WITH THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF ARMENIAN AMERICANS OUTSIDE OF ARMENIA PROPER. AND WITHIN THAT THE ARMENIAN DIASPORA GCC IS PROUD THAT OVER 35% OF ITS STUDENTS. THEY HAVE SERVING THEIR CREDIT PROGRAM AND 48% IN THEIR NON CREDIT PROGRAMS ARE OF ARMENIAN ETHNICITY. FOR NUMBER OF YEARS G. C. C.'S. ANNUALLY HAS HELD COMMEMORATIONS IN EDUCATION EVENTS DURING APRIL LEADING UP TO APRIL TWENTY FOURTH WHICH AS WE KNOW IS THE DAY. THAT THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY AROUND THE WORLD SOLEMNLY COMMEMORATES GENOCIDE REMEMBRANCE DAY. TOPICS HAVE INCLUDE GENOCIDE IN CONTEXT HISTORY AND POLITICS. IN THE TO THE D. ASPER AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE. FROM FIFTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY THREE. THE AFFECTS OF GENOCIDE DENIAL AND ITS IMPACT ON THE CURRENT ARMENIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. HOWEVER EIGHT ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH DUE TO STATE LAW CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TRANCERS OFFICE TITLE FIVE REGULATIONS GCC HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DECLARE A PUBLIC HOLIDAY. SO THIS PREVENTS FACULTY STAFF AND STUDENTS FROM JOINING IN ALL OF THE OTHER GENOCIDE RECOGNITIONS IN COMMEMORATIONS AROUND THE LA REGION THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE K. TWELVE DISTRICTS HAVE THE ABILITY. WHICH GLENDALE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT APPROPRIATELY MADE THAT DECISION TO TAKE APRIL TWENTY FOURTH AND COMMEMORATE THE HOLIDAY BUT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE PREVENTED FROM THAT DISCRETION SO THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROPERLY COMMEMORATE. IT HAS BARBED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN WITH ME I HAVE ANTHONY CULPEPPER WHO IS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT. FOR GLENDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO OFFER TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. THE PORTANTINO BEFORE WE START WITH YOUR SUPPORT WE HAVE A QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

ANOTHER IS THE ROLE OF THE LOCAL ELECTED BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO KEEP THIS FOLK LOCAL FOCUS AND THIRDLY THE IMPORTANCE OF A CONSULTATION WITH EMPLOYEES AND A IN ORGANIZATIONS AND WITH THAT BEING SAID OUR CONSTITUENCY THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY IS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE APRIL TWENTY FOURTH TO CLEAR HOLIDAY FOR THE COLLEGE SO THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO GET NOT ONLY THE APPORTIONMENT NECESSARY FOR COLLEGE TO CONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS. AND IN DOING THAT ALLOWING AND PARTICIPATING IN THE SUPPORT OF OUR ARMENIAN COMMUNITY AS WE REMEMBER THE TRAGEDY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE SO WE REALLY ENCOURAGE IN INTO AN AND ASKS THE THAT THE PANEL TO SUPPORT SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT AS AMENDED IT DOES NOT COST THE STATE AND LOCAL DOT TAXPAYERS ANY MONEY IN IT DOES NOT LESSEN THE OBLIGATION OF THE COLLEGE TO MAINTAIN THE NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS REQUIRED BY STATE AW.
