AND RESPONDING TO THAT THE QUESTIONS HERE- THE FIRST- QUESTION WILL BE ADDRESSED BY CARLA- BUT I'M GOING TO SPEAK BRIEFLY. TO QUESTIONS TWO AND THREE. SO AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA- AND CERTAINLY I CONCERN OF THE DIP. WITH PARTICULAR AT OUR K. WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN OUR START THAT DAY HAVE ANY OF. IN OUR PROJECT TO BUDGET. SO I'LL JUST GO AHEAD OF HER YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW. FOR CURRENT YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUR CASELOAD WE HAVE AN UPDATED PROJECTION OF. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETEEN CONSUMERS. WHICH IS ACTUALLY REFLECTING A DECREASE FROM OUR ENACTED ON CURRENT YEAR BUDGET OF EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS- WHEN WE LOOK TO A PROJECTION FOR BUDGET YEAR- WHAT WE DID IN OUR PROJECTION FOR CASELOAD IN OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT WE ACTUALLY WANTED TO RETAIN. OUR TREND WITH THE INTENT IS TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER WITHIN THE EARLY START PROGRAM PRIMARILY FOR AND TAKEN ALL TALK ABOUT THAT NOW A MOMENT. SO FOR BUDGET YOU'RE A CASELOAD ESTIMATE IS THAT- ESTIMATED AT. THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE INDIVIDUALS. WHICH REFLECTS NET INCREASE. OVER OUR- UPDATED- CURRENT YEAR OF JUST OVER TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THIS REPRESENTS AN OVERALL 8% INCREASE ON JUST TO GIVE YOU A REFERENCE FOR DISPLAY WERE ABOUT 425% AS OUR CASELOAD- GROSS. A AND BASIS- OF NOTES- PRIMARILY WE ARE- RECORD. OF AFFAIR OUT OF THAT THAT. IN OUR REALLY STARTING. SO FROM OUR YEAR FTA TO OUR YEAR. ARE PROJECTING AN INCREASE FOR ON OUR RELEASED START FROM AT NIGHT. FIVE AND ONE WHICH IS WHY WOULD WE BE I'M DOING A PER. AND NOT ME IT TO YOUR CASE LOW ESTIMATES- ONE WHICH IS- IN THE AREA WHICH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE- DILIGENT AND HYPER. ON OUR STAGE CASE- PRIMARY ALSO WAS SOME OF THE INTO AND LETTER SERVICE. UNDER TWO ISSUES ARE REALLY. OUR EARLY. ON ONE IS THE DOOR IF YOU WILL- THANK YOU THAT ARE KIND INTO THE PROGRAM WE SEE I'D BE VERY AT THE PEAK BACKING APRIL OF TWENTY TO. OF OUR EARLY START- AND DRY CORAL TO STAY AT ORDER COATED- AND WE CAN KIND OF MAKE SOME OF. AS TO WHY WAS SENT THEM- IT IT TO BE THAT- THERE IS A D. AND- TO THEIR- WELL- WELL BABY CHECK- PEDIATRICIAN. I'M NOT BEING IN IN AND- THERE'S A NUMBER OF AREAS IN WHICH ARE TYPICALLY ARE FOR TO OUR REFERRALS FOR EARLY STARTS ARE- CERTAINLY DOES IS VERY CAN. TO AND WE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PRO. THAT THE RESULTS THEY ARE DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR- TO ADDRESS THESE THEIR- THAT'S THE WHY WE DID NOT MAKING A- TO THE OPRY DOLLAR THAT NOR WE WOULD GO CORPS INSIDE. WITH A DECREASE OR IN. OF A CASE- SO WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT ADDRESSING SOME THE ISSUE WITH- EARLY START LIKE I SAY THE FRONT DOOR BY ALSO TRANSIT. FROM EARLIEST IN- AND- FROM THE START WITH- REALLY ADDRESS THAT CHOI FINE- WE'RE FOR IN THAT DEVELOPER SERVICE THIS. WE HAVE MANY NETWORK PARTNERS THAT ARE REALLY- FOCUSED ON- ASSURING ACCESS TO- REALLY START FOR THOSE KIDS THAT ARE AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING THE DISABILITY. YEAH WE WORKED WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS PARTICULARLY THEIR INTERAGENCY. COORDINATING COUNCIL. I FOCUS ON WHAT ARE THE- FOR THAI BY WHAT IT OPERATE. BRIDGE AND OUTREACH TO- PEDIA. TO RAISE THE AWARENESS THAT WE ARE. I'M REALLY THINK THIS CIGNA- AND REFERRAL. WE ALSO- THE SEARCH GENERAL WHO- GRACE OFF TO DO. PUBLIC SERVICE AND- ON BOTH IN ENGLISH AND WILL BE IN SPANISH CLOSED CAPTION. ON THAT WILL BE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE THIS WEEK RAISING THIS ISSUE- IT DEFINITELY WE ALSO HAVE A FOCUS ON WORKGROUP- THAT IS COMPRISED OF ADVOCATES WITHIN OUR SYSTEM SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON EARLY START SERVICES. MEMBERS CLINICAL STAFF AT THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THEN ALSO THE UNIVERSITY FOR EXPLAINS- BEING A TO FOCUS- THESE ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO ADDRESS THEM BEING RESPONSIVE- AND NUMBER- DURING THIS TO. OF AS FAR AS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE FOR THOSE- OF THE KIDS THAT WERE MOVING FROM EARLY START AT AGE THREE- EITHER- UNTIL IT ACTUALLY. PROGRAM THROUGH THE PA SCHOOL OR UNTIL MATTER SERVICES- WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MANY SYSTEMS ARE REALLY FACED THESE CHALLENGES AND CERTAINLY EDUCATION WAS ONE- AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO BRING ON THE KID'S- DURING THAT TIME TO CRITICALLY EARLY ON AND. AND THE PANDEMIC. SO WE ISSUED A DIRECT- EARLY- JUNE- WE'RE UNDER THE AGE. ORDER IS GAVE- I SAW TO WAY CERTAIN- DIFFERENT THAT WE WAIT TO THAT TIME WAS TO. HAVE A- THAT WE DID NOT AND EARLIEST SERVICE FOR THE CHILDREN. THAT WERE NOT TO AGILE. SERVICES AT THE AGE OF THREE. THE REGIONAL CENTERS- WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE THOSE SERVICES FOR THESE KIDS. THIS IS BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH APRIL OF THIS- CURRENT YEAR AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO EVALUATE WE ARE DEFINITELY SEE AN INCREASE IN OUR INTAKE FOR CHILDREN. WE'RE ALSO SEEING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TRANSITIONING TO EDUCATION SERVICES. SO MANY OF THOSE STRATEGIES ARE CERTAINLY WORKING BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE EFFORTS. BECAUSE WE DEALT DO YOU KNOW THAT I'M RECOVERY IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA IS GOING TO TAKE US. A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND ON THE LONGER THAT WE- THE LADY SERVICES TWO KIDS THE HIGHER RISK THEY ARE GOING TO BE- FOR LONGER TERM. NEEDS WITHIN OUR SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THAT FOCUS AND PRIORITY. SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND HANDED OFF TO CARLA CASTANEDA TO PROVIDE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF. THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DISCUSSING IT UP THANK YOU- BECAUSE THE OTHER DEPARTMENT OR LITTLE SERVICES ARE CURRENTLY BUDGET IS TO GROW THRILLED AND FROM INTERACTIVE BUDGET NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT POINT NINE BILLION GENERAL. THAT INCREASES IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO POINT FIVE BILLION SIX POINT FIVE RANGE OF FUND YOU'RE A HIGHLIGHTS THE BREAK OF EXPENDITURES REGIONAL CENTERS OPERATED AND BORDERS. THE INCREASE IN FUNDING SUPPORT PROJECTION FOR ROAD UTILISING. AS WERE AS- TO. FOR WITH. AND IT JUST I DON'T THAT ARE ACT AND DELIVERY OF SIR. BURKE NINETEEN NEXT. IN CURRENT YEAR WERE HUNDRED AND FORMALLY. OF ABOUT TWO FIFTY TWO POINT FOUR CHEN FUND MANAGERS AGREED TO FOR THE FOR YEAR. IN THE BUDGET YEAR INTERESTED IN INK BECAUSE RELATED TO CORPORATE CORPORATE HALF YEAR THAT'S ABOUT TO COME AND SIXTY POINT ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION CHEN FUND. WITH EXPANDED WERE TO THEIR RECENT TRENDS BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THESE ARE SOME ON THE WILL BE RIVER WITH REVISION GIVEN OF THE A LOT AND MAINTAIN ENJOY THE OVERALL IS VERY IT RESPONSE TO. ADDITIONAL ITEM TO BE TO LATER THE YEAR CHEN OUR NEXT ARCHER OF RATES AND THE YOU KNOW HOW. SYSTEM UNTIL OF TWENTY TWENTY. AS WELL ONGOING RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR. AND ARE GOING FOR EMERGING FRIDAY REYES AND WE'RE- THIS. ADDITION CREASE AND FOLDS BY TWO. REFLECT ONGOING FOR REGIONAL QUEER MUSIC FOR STATE LAW I. T. JUST US. AS WELL AS ON COSTS RELATED TO- AFTER YOU FOR TRAINING ARTIST. AND THE FULL EMPLOYMENT OF EVERYTHING ENACTED DIVERSION PROGRAM- AT THE TRANSFERRING THEY GIVE. DIRECTOR MEN ALREADY- THE VERY SORT OF OPTIMISTIC GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS SPILLED INTO THEIR BUDGET AND YOU GENDER ALSO INCLUDE SOME ADDITIONAL. ABOUT THAT SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO OVER ALL OF THOSE EXCEPT THE ONE THING I WOULD KNOW IS THE ASSUMPTION ABOUT. HIS SLOW GROWTH AMONG INFANTS AND TODDLERS AND EARLY START PROGRAM. IS THAT 21% IS ACTUALLY. HALF AT LEAST DOUBLE THAT OF ANY YEAR IN THE PAST TWO DECADES SO IT IS A VERY OPTIMISTIC GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS. OUR OFFICE IS POINT IS NOT THAT- YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE INDIVIDUAL INFANTS AND TODDLERS IF THEY WERE ABLE TO COME INTO THE SYSTEM AND RECEIVE THE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES THAT CAN REALLY HELP WITH LATER LIFE OUTCOMES AND IN FACT IF THEY ARE IF THEY WERE TO RECEIVE THESE SERVICES THAT CAN NOT ONLY HELP- THEM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS BUT ALSO. IT FROM A PHYSICAL PERSPECTIVE IT CAN MEAN THAT THEY REQUIRE FEWER SERVICES OR OVER THE COURSE OF THE LIFESPAN WHICH ALSO TRANSLATES INTO LOWER COST FOR THE STATE- POINT REALLY IS THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS IF THE IF THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO- TO GET MORE INFANTS AND TODDLERS BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. ARE NOT AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEY HOPE IT COULD MEAN THAT COSTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR- ARE OVERSTATED AND WE TOOK A LOOK AT HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CASELOAD GROWTH AND CONSIDERED. BOTH THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC AS WELL AS THE OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF RE OPENING AND WE ESTIMATE THAT COSTS IN THE BUDGET COULD BE OVERSTATED IN THE BDGET YEAR BY AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND OR MORE. HOWEVER WE DO NOT RECOMMEND A DOWNWARD DOWNWARD REVISION AT THIS TIME INSTEAD WE RECOMMEND WAITING UNTIL THE MAY REVISION WHEN WE HAVE- MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ACTUAL CASELOAD ON A MONTH TO MONTH BASIS AND WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S OWN ASSUMPTIONS. I'M AND WE WILL BE HAPPY TO FURTHER ADVISED AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FINANCED ANYTHING. HE CHAIR STEVEN PAUL BERMAN FINANCE WE HAVE NOT ADDITIONAL TO ADD. OKAY YOU VERY MUCH- AND DIRECTOR CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO YOUR OPTIMISTIC GOOD NUMBERS. AND THE ADDRESS LMAO. YES MADAM CHAIR AND- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS OPTIMISTIC BUT WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT RECOVERY- BY HAVING A REGIONAL CENTERS AND WE TALKED TO THE REGIONAL CENTER DIRECTORS- BECAUSE WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCREASED WORKLOAD OF. DOING THE ASSESSMENTS AND BRING IN INDIVIDUALS ON- I'M IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND WANTED TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO- AND I HANDLE THAT WORKLOAD- EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING KIDS ON FOR SERVICES SKINNER THAN LATER. ON AND IT REALLY HAS BEEN MORE OF THIS ALL HANDS ON DECK TO STATE THAT WE IT'S NOT A MATTER OF CAN WE OR SHOULD WE AS A MATTER WE NEED TO DO THIS- SO THEY STARTED TO DO SOME OF THE RECOVERY NOW- AND SO WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT BEING ABLE TO BUILD. UP THE INTAKES AND BRINGING KIDS ON. YOU MUST HAVE A- COMMENT ABOUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF NAY REVISED IS STILL HOW WE'RE DOING IN OUR RECOVERY BE ABLE TO HAVE. A BETTER- KIND OF CLARITY AND TO BE- PROJECTIONS OR BUDGET YEAR- THANK BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT AREA WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE- TO CLINICIANS TO DO THE ASSESSMENTS THAT THEY HAVE THEIR EARLY START- STAFF BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO REDUCE THAT- OPERATIONS DOLLARS TO REGIONAL CENTRES MAY BE PUT IN A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE TO. REDUCE THE STAFF THAT ARE WORKING AN EARLY START AND THEN SHOULD WE ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO BRING MY KIDS ON. THAN WHAT THEY HAD THE EFFECTIVE COORDINATION FOR SERVICES OR WOULD WE THEN BE- REPLACING ONE PROBLEM WITH ANOTHER- SO THAT'S THAT WAS I'M TO THE POINT OF HOW WE TOOK THIS APPROACH- IN HIS PROPOSED BUDGET OKAY. CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE SINCE I THINK WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE AND GETTING KIDS AND IS SOONER IS BETTER AND THAT THE DROP OFF HAS BEEN BECAUSE KIDS ARE BORN. THE DOCTOR BUT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT A NINETY YOU SEE YOU WERE THERE DOING A- PUTTING SOME STUFF ON THE WEBSITE BUT HOW ARE WE GO. OUT MORE. AND I. THESE KIDS BECAUSE OUGHT WE KNOW IF THE COST WILL GET LARGER IF THEY YOU KNOW THEY DO GET INTO. SOON ENOUGH IN THEN TRY TO. INTO AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT IS ALSO RIGHT GOING THROUGH ITS OWN STRUGGLES TRYING TO RE OPEN. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING PROACTIVELY TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS AND FAMILIES ARE RECEIVING SERVICES HAS BEEN A FOR EVERY CHILD AT HOME NOT RECEIVING SERVICES. THAT'S EXTRA STRESS ON A FAMILY THAT IS ALSO TRYING TO COPE DURING THIS PANDEMIC. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- AND THAT'S WHERE THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH THE- ICC WHICH- IS- REALLY A GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS AS THE INTERAGENCY COORDINATING COUNCIL- AND THE WORK THAT THEY DO. THEIR PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE WITHIN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD. DEVELOPMENT AND EARLY START PROGRAMS- TO REALLY LOOKING NICE THAT'S TO WHAT IT DOES STRATEGIES- CHILD FIND HAS BEEN ONE OF THE AREAS INTO HOW WE COULD REALLY DO THAT OUT OF REACH- AND AGAIN IT'S- KIND OF A MULTI SYSTEM APPROACH- THERE'S BEEN AND EVEN UNDER THE- ICC THEY'VE BEEN DISTRIBUTING COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND FIRES IN INFO GRAPHICS WE HAVE A BROCHURE THAT'S GONE OUT IT'S GOING OUT MULTIPLE LANGUAGE. IS ALSO ADMITTED THAT THAT PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IS GOING TO BE RELEASED- THIS WEEK IN ADDRESSING THAT- WE ALSO HAD- THE ICC I BELIEVE AND I HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE CLARITY ON THAT- BUT THEY- CAN'T. REALLY TOOK A LOOK AT A PLAN TO DO PROACTIVE OUTREACH BUT ALSO TO OUR REACH WITHIN YOU KNOW HEALTH PLANS BUT THEN ALSO LOOKING AT- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE- KINDA EDUCATION AND- OUTREACH TO PEDIATRICIANS- SO WE HAD REACHED OUT TO THE ASSOCIATION'S TO ALSO BE ABLE TO RAISE AWARENESS WITHIN PEDIATRICIANS. OF WE ALSO OOK A LOOK AT HOW DO WE DO AVERAGE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE- WE ARE VERY VERY CONCERNED THAT THOSE THAT COULD BE GREATEST IMPACTED OUR OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WHICH WILL GREATER. IMPACT A DISPARITY- OF THAT WE DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE TO- HAVE AND PARTICULARLY IN THE AS PART IN IN THIS AREA. SO IT MORE LIKE I SAID WE HAVE THIS FOCUS GROUP THAT HAS ALSO REVIEWING KIND OF THE- KIDS THAT- WE NEED TO DO SO OUR REGION PROACTIVE APPROACH SO IT'S NOT. I OFTEN SAY THAT IN MANY OF THESE EFFORTS IT CAN'T JUST BE ONE EVENTS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOOK AT ARE THEY EFFECTIVE AND IF THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE. WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO DOUBLE DOWN. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING OUTREACH. AND I'M SURE I'M SURE BANKS AND DIAPER ARE ON YOUR FULLER OF. THAT YOU DO- AND THEN ALWAYS A THINK JUST. LOOK AHEAD DO WE PLAN FOR THIS LONG TERM AS I DIED THIS THAT IS YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO. POPULATION TO GROW HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE REACHING THEM. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND MAINTAINING- STRUCTURE IN SUPPORT. AS PEOPLE MOVE ON TO THE MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- EACH COACH JOHN. WHAT I HAD EXPECTED NOT AND YOU WONDER. SO THE REFERRAL ARE BECOMING LEARN FROM DOT VISITS. SO YOU SENATOR AND- AND HOLIDAYS YOU PART OF AUDIO UP AS THE I CAN IT IS REALLY LOOK AT WHERE OUR REFERRALS COMING FROM- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS IN WHICH OUR REFERRALS DO COME FROM OFTENTIMES- DON'T COME FROM THE NECK YOU FROM THE HOSPITAL- WE WILL GET THEM FROM POSITIONS- WE ALSO GET. THAT FROM FIRST FIVE WILL GET THEM FROM TWO ONE ONE- THERE'S NEVER A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS- JOURNEYED FROM UT BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK WITH OUR LIVE NEXT COMMUNITY WITH OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AT. VARIOUS COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT OUR REACH IS WHERE WE GET THOSE REFERRALS. WE DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE CERTAIN- POPULATIONS THAT WE HAVE- UNDER REPRESENTED IN OUR EARLY START PROGRAM- WE KNOW THAT ARE NATIVE AMERICAN AND OUR ASIAN COMMUNITIES ARE PARTICULARLY UNDERREPRESENTED AN EARLY START AND THOSE ARE SOME AREAS IN WHICH- WE NEED TO- CONTINUE THOUGH THAT THIS STRATEGY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES HOW TO BEST- DO THAT OUTRAGE TO. MAKE SURE THEY WERE BRINGING THEM IN SOONER THAN LATER BECAUSE IT IS SO CRITICAL TO HAVE THAT EARLY. INTERVENTION VERY EARLY ON. RIGHT OKAY I'M IT SO. HAS BEEN A SLOW. OF ROOF. OR TO SLOWING. YOU KNOW INTENTION TO. ENTERING THIS IS- BERMAN YEAH I THINK YOU GREAT QUESTION- IT I'M GOING TO IT MORE NOT JUST AS EVERY AND WHEN IT IT IT ACTUALLY WASN'T- BACK IN A- IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WE HAVE- SEND AND GRAPHIC THAT WILL. KIND OF OUR EARLIEST CASES- AND COMING MARCH AND APRIL IT LITERALLY TAKES A NOSE DIVE- AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAN SAY WITH PRETTY CERTAIN- RELIABILITY THAT IS VERY MUCH TIED TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN A PANDEMIC- ANNUALLY WELL WE'RE OUR GROWTH AN EARLY START. HOW SLOWED DOWN SOME. OVER HE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE CONTINUE TO SEE- GROWTH ANNUALLY AND OUR EARLY START PROGRAM BUT AS- MISS PEDICAB NOTED THAT- WE ARE DEFINITELY SHOWING. OF MUCH GREATER PERCENTAGE AS A RESULT OF TRYING TO GET THIS RECOVERY- BUT WE DO SEE ANNUALLY A GROWTH ANYWAY- BUT LIKE I SAID BACK IN MARCH AND APRIL WE HAD THIS THIS CLASS OF- REALLY START PARTICIPATION- THAT WAS IMPACTED AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO RECOVER FROM. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THANK YOU. THIRTY I THANK THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION CERTAINLY IS A DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN AND- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE MEDICAID SERVICES REPORTED BETWEEN MARCH AND MAY- THERE'S BEEN A FALL OFF OF ALMOST 50% I THINK FORTY FIVE FORTY EIGHT OR SOMETHING PERCENT AND WELL CHILD VISITS SO WE'RE TALKING ALMOST HALF RIGHT AND THAT'S WHERE LAS SCREENING HAPPENS- OREGON REPORTED THAT THROUGH OCTOBER THAT THERE IS A 28% DROP. AND AGAIN- CATCHY YOUNG CHILDREN- GETTING- THERE WELL CHILD VISITS AS WELL- AT EIGHT EVERY SHEET THAT I IT IS ONLY UNDERSTAND THAT- AND- THAT- YOU GET REFERRALS MANY DIFFERENT PLACES BUT OFTENTIMES I THINK THE- THAT'S HOW MUCH OF YOU KNOW CERTAINLY IF A CERTAIN PARENTS MAY BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS IF THERE- PRETTY- I GUESS- MARK CAN TO OTHER BY FOR MORE SUBTLE THINGS- THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO SCREW TO THE SCREENING TOOLS WE USE IN A PR OFFICE OR PERHAPS A CHILD CARE SITE WE HAPPEN TO KNOW ALSO HERE IN THIS. THAT CHILD IS FALLING AS WELL SO THE PROFESSION WHO ARE MORE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT- THE FAMILIES AREN'T THE COUNTERING AS MUCH- WHETHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE LESS CHILD CARE NOTHING TARGET ARE NOT SEEN PEDIATRICIANS AS WELL AND- APPRECIATE THE OUTRAGE I DON'T THINK THAT THE TEACHERS IS DOING LESS SCREENING NOW IN TERMS OF THE PATIENTS THEY ACTUALLY DO YOU SEE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THAT- AND THIS IS IN SOME SENSES- BLAINE IT'S NOT ON YOUR LAP AND LAYING THIS ON BUT IS THERE A- WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. I MEAN THIS REALLY TO ME FOR EXAMPLE FIRST OF ALL A WEEK ARE YOU GETTING DATA FROM THAT CAL AS FAR AS HOW MANY MEDICARE OLD KIDS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING THEIR WELL CHILD VISITS SO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY ARE GOING THROUGH SOME CITING DATA FROM THE NATIONAL OR ANOTHER STATE BUT WE HAVE THE TO HEAR IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S BEEN SHARED WITH YOU IN TERMS OF- NUMBER WELL CHILD VISITS START HAPPENING- IT'S DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE THAT MAY AP PART OF. GOING ON- AND- SO I THINK THAT THE IMPORT SO THAT'S THE MEDICAL FOLKS I. SO I DON'T KNOW THE SHIRLEY LIKE THAT WITH YOU- I. CERTAIN TWO A PIECE. BUT YOU KNOW I THE AT THE TIME ON HOW MUCH REACH IT. HEALTH AWAY SPREAD WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S TO SEE A- HOW MANY PEOPLE SEE IT. I AS END I'M SURE YOU'RE PAGES VERY POP. BUT I THINK- YOU KNOW WITHIN A TO GAIN TO GENERAL HOT. IT'S GONNA NEED A LOT SPREAD BUT I GUESS THE OTHER THING IS THAT. I DON'T KNOW SAY THAT WE NEED PUBLIC CAN. DURING PEOPLE TO BRING THEIR KIDS TO THE DOCTOR OFFICE BECAUSE WE SEEM TO FALL OFF NOT ONLY OF COURSE. OF VISITS YOU SEEN FALL OFF AND IN GREAT TEAM IS. AND OF COURSE WHAT WE DON'T TALK AS MUCH ABOUT IS THAT DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING. SO SO I GUESS. THAT HAS. IS YOUR DEPARTMENT GETTING DATA WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING LIKE EARLY START FROM OF LET'S SAY A MEDIC CAL PROGRAM IS TO HOW MANY VISITS- THEY'RE DOING COMPARED TO PRE- COVE. YOU'LL COVER IN TERMS OF HELPING YOU WITH YOUR PROJECTIONS. AND ALSO IS THERE A SENSE THERE AND THOUGHT ABOUT DOING SOME SORT OF MORE PUBLIC CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO SEE TO PEDIATRICIANS WHY YOU'RE FROM PEDIATRICIANS IS THAT PEOPLE ARE COMING IN. BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF BECAUSE OF IT. AND EVEN THOUGH MANY PEDIATRICIANS OFFICE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD- AND- AND ARE ACTUALLY QUITE SAFE FROM BECAUSE OF IT THEY HAVE SEPARATE YOU KNOW WELLS VISITS SEPARATE FROM. VISITS THE DAYS EVEN VETS A LOT. AND SO FORTH ALTHOUGH I SHOULD ALSO POINT TO YOU HEIGHT OF THE- HELLO OF PRACTICE IS ONE THING. FROM TO BUT- BUT- SO IS AYE SIR SEE THIS IS A CALL. THING THAT AND I. I'M BRING IT UP TO YOU YOU'RE AT THE END OF THE REFERRAL. BUT IT REALLY IS ABOUT SUPPORT PRIME CARE PRACTICE. US AT THAT DON'T WORK FINANCE TROUBLES. THE THAT THE PANDEMIC. AND I KNOW WE'RE DOING SO ASSIST AND OTHER OF THINGS CALVING DATA HOW MUCH DEVELOP. SCREENINGS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW NUMBER OF WELL CHILD VISITS ITSELF FOR THE HAVING WOULD SAY PUT. THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AT LEAST WE SHOULD UPDATE ON THAT FROM THE STATE. AND THEN. WE USING THAT TO BE ABLE ALL TO BE SURE. THAT REFERRALS ARE. THROUGH TO- TO- EARLY START WHICH I THINK THAT. SHINS LEAST. NOT SAY THEY CAN DO A- JOB CREE COVE IT BUT- I. THINK THEY- STUFF- THEY STOP DOING THAT AS- AS MUCH. THEY'RE JUST. THAT JUST NOT TO THE KIDS AND FIRST PLAY. BECAUSE PEOPLE SO CONCERN. SO YOU SPEAK TO THAT WHETHER THERE'S A MULTI AGENCY. EFFORT TO LOOK AT THIS. YEAH THANK YOU DOCTOR. AND ALWAYS A PRE. THAT AS A PPO- I. IDEALLY LIKE I MAIN OF OUR- WELL I WILL PREFACE WAS SAYING. THAT IT DOES IT NEVER FOR LIKE WE'RE- ANOTHER- BECAUSE I HAVE A PRETTY. CASH FOR STARTS- BUT I TOTALLY AGREE. YOU KNOW IT IS NOT ONCE. FITS ALL RIGHT NOW AND HOW WE DO OUR OUT REACH FOR EARLY START- TO THE COMMUNITY- AND- SO WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING MULTIPLE THINGS. AND WE DID WORK WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND ISSUED. A DIRECTIVE TO THEM SAYING THAT THEY CAN'T DO THEIR- IN TAKES REMOTE. AT THEIR ASSESSMENTS CAN ALL BE REMOTE YEAH WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE IN PERSON SO WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NOT THAT BERRIER- THEN ALSO WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY SUCH AS THE ICC AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING AND DEVELOPING VERY BROAD OUTREACH MATERIALS. TO THE EARLY START. COMMUNITY AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE BROCHURES IN THOSE FLYERS THAT WERE DOING THAT ARE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES THAT ARE IN. PLAIN LANGUAGE FOR FAMILIES TO GET THEIR HANDS ON TO SAY HEY. YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS THESE ARE THE THINGS TO. BE AWARE OF YOU KNOW CONTACT YOUR HEALTH PROVIDER. CONTACT YOUR REGIONAL CENTER- WE ALL HAVE A- OTHER ANALYSTS ARE WE'VE GOT. A NUMBER DIFFERENT NEED PER. BUT WE LIKE A SAID CAN TO. THOSE ADDITIONAL. IN WHICH- WE CAN DO MORE I HAVE TO. SIT TO KNOW THE I AM- WE MAY HAVE THAT INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE JUST ASKING ABOUT WITH. ON HEALTHCARE SERVICES- ON MEDI CAL IS TO GOES WELL BABY CHECKS IF NOT- I THINK THAT'S- A REALLY GOOD FOLLOW UP- PRESS TWO AND LEAN INTO AND GET THAT INFORMATION- AND THEN ALSO. USE THAT TO HELP US FIGURE OUT SOME NEXT STEPS AN ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES- BECAUSE IT IT THIS IS A- IN ISSUE THAT WERE OWNING- AND THEN WE WANT TO USE ALL OF OUR SYSTEM PARTNERS WHETHER IT'S OTHER STATE DEPARTMENT. OR OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO. ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IT'S JUST WAY TOO CRITICAL MASS. YEAH I MEAN I THINK AGAIN IT'S AND THAT IT THAT IT I THANK YOU. CERTAINLY FROM READING THE REPORTS- YOUR AGENCIES DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO TRY JUSTICE ISSUE I REALLY APPRECIATE IT THIS IS ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ACROSS THE SILOS. I SHOULD MAKE NOTE THAT MEDIC HOW THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM THE ONLY OF COURSE WE HAVE TO LEADERSHIP OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM ITSELF THERE'S ALSO ADVISE YOU COULD BE ON CHILDREN. YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO HAVE TO ASK YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU CAN URGE THEM TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AS WELL. THIS IS ABOUT HOW WE PULL ALL THIS STUFF TOGETHER AND- AND TRAFFIC BUT OTHER AGENCIES AS WELL SOCIAL SERVICES ON THE CHILD CARE SIDE RIGHT- IT CETERA- SO WE CAN. THINK ABOUT THIS AGAIN MULTI AGENCY APPROACH TO TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS AND CERTAINLY AS YOU POINTED OUT IS THAT. IF WE DON'T CATCH THEM AN EARLY START. FROM DOESN'T AWAY- WE CAN. THE PAR THAT YOU QUE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING SPECIAL A- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PLAY CATCH UP SO DATA SO THOSE EXPENSES. GROW IF WE DON'T GET THE KIDS IN NOW. AND- EARLY START- AND- SO HOPEFULLY AGAIN NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FORCE- S- AGENTS. PAINFUL THAN THIS BUT I DO THIS JUST A MULTI. APPROACH I ALSO JUST WANT TO QUICKLY MENTION CERTAINLY AS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. RECOGNIZE THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT THE LAST YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT LACK OF REFERRALS A RELEASE THAT THE DECREASE ENROLLMENT OF- ASIAN- CHILDREN- I. GUESS BIG QUESTION THERE IS THAT- LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY IS USUALLY ONE OF THE BIGGER BARRIERS- SO IF THE SERVICES ARE DEVELOPED IN LANGUAGE AND- A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW THEY DO ENGLISH TO SPANISH AND CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR LATINO COMMUNITY. STANDS IS A LEVEL. THAT NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT. MY AND ELAINE AVAILABILITY SO- IF YOU CAN JUST BRIEF- AND- AND- ON- LANGUAGE ACTS. FOR PARTICULARLY- ASIA PACIFIC ISLANDER- A CLIENT. YEAH THANK YOU DR PANDA AND MUCH OF THAT OUTRAGE- IN EARLY START STRAIGHT IS LOOKING KIND OF LANGUAGE- WE HAD HEARD THAT SOME OF THAT YOU. IS THE DIFFERENT DIALECTS THAT- MADE MADE FACE A BEING TO- REACH TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT CAN ASSIST US IN THAT- SO THERE'S THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE REALLY NEED TO- DEVELOP ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES THE OTHER IS THEN ALSO USING THE TRUSTED COMMUNITIES TO DO THE OUTRAGE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE HAD HEARD- THAT THERE'S EVEN SOME KIND OF CULTURAL- BARRIERS AND- THAT WE NEED TO BE RESPECTFUL OF AND BRING- THOSE TRUSTED- INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN. DO THAT OUR REACH TO HELP DOES COME TO THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A RESOURCE TO HELP THEIR CHILD- AND SO WE DO NEED TO NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE LANGUAGE- KIND OF BARRIERS AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE CAPTURING THE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS- BUT THEN ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE USING THOSE TRUSTED RESOURCES AND COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE A SAFE SPACE FOR THAT CONVERSATION AS WELL I APPRECIATE THAT RECOGNITION- THERE IS UNFORTUNATELY A HIGH LEVEL STATEMENT TERMS OF ACCESSING. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND I KNOW YOU DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES BUT OFTENTIMES OVER FOR DICK CAL COMMUNITY THAT THEY DON'T MISS A DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN THE TWO AND DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY MAYBE ALSO HAVE A STIGMA ATTACHED TO THAT AS WELL FOR THE FAMILY. AND MAY NOT SEEK THOSE SERVICES THANK. YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MUCH. OKAY OF SO MOVING ON. ISSUE NUMBER. TWO GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE BRIAN MITCHELL DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND I WILL BE COVERING QUESTIONS TWO THREE AND FOUR ON PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA. SPECIFICALLY WHAT CHALLENGES THE DEPARTMENT HAS FACED- HOW THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED DIRECTIVES HAVE ASSISTED WITH THE PANDEMIC THE CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN AS WELL AS SOME OF THE POLICY DECISIONS GOING FORWARD AND AS WELL AS THE- THE ORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND HOW THAT HAS BEEN USEFUL DURING THE PANDEMIC. ALSO FIRST ELECTED TO START OFF BY- JUST EXPRESSING THAT-BEING PROACTIVE IN OUR APPROACH WITH OUR COMMUNITY AS WELL AS LISTENING VERY CLOSELY TO OUR COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF- THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SEEN HAS BEEN REALLY CRITICAL IN THE DEPARTMENT BEING RESPONSIVE TO THOSE NEEDS- VERY EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC WE BEGAN TO COLLECT DATA ON INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COCAINE AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS WERE HOSPITALIZED. AND FOLKS YOU UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY AND THROUGH THAT COLLECTION AND WE HAD HELPED US TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE- YES HAD MANY MANY STAY MEETINGS WHEN WE HAVE TAKE INTO INPUT FROM ARCHITECTURE EASE IN WITH SERVER YEAH MEMBERS TO SERVE PROVIDERS. AND REALLY THE CORE AND OUR ISSUE HAS BEEN PEOPLE SAFE AND PUTTING PARKS THE WEEKEND AND- WHAT. IT IS POSSIBLE TO STATE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PROTECTION. ARE IN PLACE TO BRING TO THE- I'M FROM THINGS THAT WE DONE HAVE BEEN WITH IT MACINNES OF OUR TWO. ALLOW TO CLICK. YOU SEE THE INCIDENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO SAFETY HAS ONLY BEEN ARE HARDCORE- CERN AND REALLY GET SORT OF WHITE HAS UNDERGIRDED EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT- WE ALSO HAVE SEEN A CHALLENGE AND I RESPONDED TO ACCESS TO SERVICE- BUT IF INDIVIDUALS DECIDE AND- LIKE THE BENCH FOR THEIR FAMILY HOME AND ALSO INCREASE YOUR DAIS THIS IS HOW WE RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS A TWELVE DIFFICULT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ACCESS SERVICES IN PERSON OF COURSE AND SO WE NEED A FEW- ASSIST WITH OUR SERVICE PROVISION IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE IN THE WAY THAT THIS IS A PROVIDED AND- AND DIRECTIVE HAD BEEN ISSUED BY OUR FACTOR THAT HAVE ASSISTED WITH WITH. THAT COMPLEX BILLY- HAS BEEN A- ISSUE WITH AND ARE SPACE THEM- AS YOU ACT IT WOULD COVER THE FIRST ACT. STAFF WORK WITH THE END OF THAT WE SERVE- DIFFERENTLY. YOU COULD GOING FAMILY. AND SO WE HAD TO WORK VERY CLOSELY- WITH TRADITIONAL CENTER COMBAT ARE SERVICE WRITERS ON HE SHE'S AROUND STAFFING. AND ALSO WITH REGARDS TO OUR- DIVERSE COMMUNITIES MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE BEING. VERY ATTENDED TO THEIR NEEDS RESPONDING TO ISSUE SEPARATE FROM OUR DEPARTMENT AND IN DOING THAT WE- I WORK CLOSELY WITH TO BE BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO REACH OUT TO HIM TO SUBMIT INFORMATION AND PPP. TO THE DIVERSE. AND WE'VE ENSURED THAT OUR DIRECTIVE OUR. ROOM THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE AND FINALLY. ALL AVAILABLE ON OUR AND GAS- FOR. BOB FRIEDMAN TALKED ABOUT EXTENSION OF THE EARLY START SERVICES BEYOND AGE THREE AS ONE OF THE FLEXIBILITIES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GRANT ASSIST WITH INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SERVICES ANOTHER FLEXIBILITY THAT WE RECOGNIZED EARLY ON THAT WAS NEEDED WAS A PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY SO FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RECEIVING LAUGHTER ACT SERVICES POST AGE THIRTY. IF A REGIONAL CENTER NEEDED TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND DUE TO THE PENDING THAT THEY COULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE NECESSARY RECORDS WHAT DO IN PERSON ASSESSMENTS THAT THEY HAD A FAIRLY- IDEA THAT THE PERSON WAS ELIGIBLE TO MAKE MAKE THE PRESUMPTIVE OF ELIGIBLE UNTIL THEY COULD MAKE A FINAL DETERMINATION SO THAT WAS ONE WAY THAT WE RESPONDED BY ENSURING THAT PEOPLE. RECEIVED- MY- WHEN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE STATE BEING. AND BECAME. I'M A RECOGNIZE THAT- ARE SUPPORTERS SPACE PROVIDERS YEAH- GETTING. AND PROVIDING FOR OUR LISTENERS TO INDIVIDUAL AND THAT REALLY TAKES A TOLL ON THEM OVER TIME YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING. LACK OF SPACE. THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE A ONE OR TWO PEOPLE DEAD TO PERSON SO DEVELOP- I TO FOUR HOUR SUPPORT THE SERVICES QUARANTINE GREAT- SO THERE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE DONE THROUGH. THE DIRECT INSTEAD BEEN REACHED. AND THROUGH INTO FROM ARCHIE- HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL. WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED- DIFFERS A PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES WE INITIATED THE USE OF THREE DIFFERENT SERVICES INDEPENDENT THINKING SKILLS. SUPPORTED HIM THANK THAT AND- PERSONAL ASSISTANT SELF THOSE THREE SERVICES IN A PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO PARTICIPATE DIRECTOR SERVICE. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY IS AT DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS WE'RE IMPLEMENTING ADJUSTMENT CORRECTIVE SERVICES DIFFERENTLY AND SO G. D. S. RESPONDED TO THAT ISSUE. I ELEPHANT IN HOLDING STATEWIDE TRAINING BOTH FOR REGIONAL CENTER STAFF BUT ALSO FOR- COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO HELP THEM KNOW ABOUT PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES AND WE HELP THOSE. CAN BOTH ENGLISH AND IN SPANISH. THOSE ARE ON SOME OF THE WAYS THAT ARE- HAS SHE RESPONDED TO THE CHALLENGE. OF COURSE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN IS THAT WE NEED TO BE VIGILANT ACT AND DEFENSIVE FORCE CONTINUES A PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE AT RISK OF SUFFERING YOU TO BE CAPTAIN OF THE SENATE CHARGE FORTY. IN TO THIS- THE IF THERE POINT OR TAX AND- MAKING SURE THAT- VACCINATION ARE AVAILABLE TO BE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE ESPECIALLY TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE AND REGISTRY FOR APPOINTMENTS OR GETTING TO A SITE FOR VACCINATION. I MEAN ISSUED A DIRECTIVE ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH- REGIONAL CENTERS TO CONTACT ALL INDIVIDUAL SIXTY FIVE OR OVER. THEIR VACCINATION STATUS AND ALSO GIVEN GUIDANCE ON THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCED THAT- REGARDING VACCINATIONS AVAIL ABLE AS OF MARCH FIFTY. SO THOSE THE VACCINATION IS DEFINITELY A WE HAVE A WAY TO TRACK- CONSUMER VACCINATIONS. A WE WERE LOOKING AT THAT DATA FREQUENTLY AND WHAT WE CAN TO ASSIST REGIONAL CENTERS ARE WORKING WITH THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I'M ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HAS TO DO WITH- PUBLICITA STATIONS GOING FORWARD APPLE AND- LISTEN TO OUR COMMUNITY THURMOND REALLY THREE AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE EXPRESSED AND- ASSISTANCE LONG TERM DEBT HAS BEEN HELPFUL DURING THE PANDEMIC. FIRST IS THE A LONG TERM EXTENSION OF THE PARTISAN DIRECTED SERVICES THAT I SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER. I'M IN SO I'M WE HAVE OUR DRAFTING REGULATIONS AND THOSE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE SPRING TO INCLUDE PART SB SERVICES ONGOING- WITH POSSIBLE- HEARD. ABOUT THE- HOW REMOTE SERVICE IS A VERY HELPFUL HE ENGAGED IN THAT PEOPLE GET. IN THE HOME THE FIRST FOURTEEN- IF THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN EXPAND OUR MAKE PERMANENT JUST BECAUSE OUR FEDERAL LABOR. LET BE FOR ABOUT THE EXTENSION OF THE EARLY START SERVICES AND HOW THAT HAS BEEN REALLY HELPFUL IN SITUATIONS WHERE IT'S UNCLEAR IF A PERSON. IS ELIGIBLE THAT- THEY NEED TO CONTINUE T RESEARCH THE EARLY START SERVICES. ARE AND TELL- THEY RECEIVE SCHOOL SERVICES OF THE PRASADA GAP WILL SERVICE. AND LASTLY I WILL COVER THE ORGANIZATION THE- TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE WILL. REORGANISE OF OUR DEPARTMENT. AND I WILL SAY THAT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE ORGANIZATION WE COULD NOT HAVE THE AND- AS RESPONSIBLE. AND CERTAINLY NOT AS QUICKLY RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY DURING THIS TIME- THIS INTO PARTICULAR AREAS OF OUR DEPARTMENT WE OFFER SECURITY OPERATIONS WHERE WE HAVE SEVENTY LIAISON TEAMS. S. B. OF THE- STAFF EACH TEAM COVER THREE REGIONAL CENTERS EACH AND THESE LIAISON TEENS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL AND I'M TAKING CALLS FROM THE UNITY. OF THE NETWORK TO EXPLAIN DIRECTIVES TO FAMILIES TO HELP RESOLVE HI. FAMILY AND CONSUMER ISSUES AND JUST REALLY PROVIDED A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BOTH TO REGIONAL CENTERS AS WELL AS TO THE COMMUNITY. AND WE NOTE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A HUNDRED AND 24% INCREASE IN CONTACT FROM THE TO THE V. THE STAFF THAT WE HAD AVAILABLE- WE TRACK ALL THE CALLS AND EMAILS CORRESPONDENCE WE RECEIVED. AN INFORMATION HAS BEEN VERY USEFUL IN THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION OR GUIDANCE AS WELL AS FAQS THAT WE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE BASED ON THE POLICIES. ISSUED RECENTLY. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ENGAGE MORE FREE WITH SO. AND ITS ON ALL THE CHEATING WHO GET HERE FOR AND ISSUES THAT ARE. HAPPY WITH SUCH THEY'RE ALL WE. THE OTHER WITH A PART WHERE WE WENT THROUGH WE WERE. YES YOU OFFICE OF WHITE SERVICES AND OFFICE BEEN A REALLY CRITICAL- I MENTIONED EARLIER THE THAT COLLECT REGIONAL CENTERS ON INDIVIDUAL FOR TEST OTHER. AND ARE STAFF HAVE BEEN TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH REGIONAL CENTERS WITH LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH WITH OFTENTIMES LARGE CONCRETE SETTINGS WHERE INFECTIONS HAVE BROKEN OUT AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- DAVID. PROVIDED A LOT OF TRAINING AND PREVENTION FOR THE SPREAD OF THE NINETEEN SO- IN CLOSING THESE TWO AREAS OF THE DEPARTMENT- HAVE ABSOLUTELY ASSISTED US IN THE RESPONSIVE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND TO OUR COMMUNITY. AND IN A VERY POSITIVE. WAY THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU VERY. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. EVEN POPCORN FINANCE. HELLO. THANK YOU THIS IS SONYA PATRICK AGAIN FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE JUST HAD A COUPLE OF POINTS TO MAKE ABOUT THE DDS DIRECTIVES THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED DURING THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC- YOU KNOW WE WOULDN'T WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN TRYING TO REALLY BALANCE- SIMULTANEOUS PRESSURES THERE'S THE- OF PRESSURE TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO STAY HEALTHY SAFE. ENGAGED AND AVOID CRISES- AND THE SIMULTANEOUS PRESSURE OF TRYING TO SUSTAIN THE NETWORK OF SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THEIR STAFF SOME OF WHOM MAY FEEL- YOU HAVE BURNED OUT OR OVER WORKED AS MR. WINFIELD ALLUDED TO AND- SOME OF WHOM MAY FEEL THEY NEED MORE WORK ACTUALLY AT THIS TIME- THE DIRECTIVES THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS ISSUED HAVE REALLY HELPED- SERVICE PROVIDERS AND REGIONAL CENTERS RESPOND IN A FLEXIBLE WAY TO THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES- BUT IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN WITH OUT. OF CHALLENGES- WE HAVE HEARD FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE DIRECTED AT SOME OF THE DIRECTIVES MAY NOT BE. IMPLEMENTED IN AN ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WAY ACROSS THE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS- FOR A COUPLE OF THEM THAT THERE MIGHT BE SORT OF A LACK OF CLARITY ABOUT WHAT THE DIRECTIVE IS TRYING TO DO- OR HOW TO HOW TO REALLY IMPLEMENT THAT DIRECTIVE. AND THEN- THE POINT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON AT THE MOMENT IS THAT THE DURATION OF THE FLEXIBILITIES- MOST OF THEM BEING IN PLACE FOR THIRTY DAYS AT A TIME. HAS WE'VE HEARD THAT THIS IS CREATED- A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY DURING WHAT IS ALREADY AN UNCERTAIN TIME- AND THIS IS COUPLED WITH ALSO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT A POSSIBLE SUSPENSION OF- SUPPLEMENTAL PROVIDER RATES WHICH WILL REALLY WE WILL ADDRESS IN THE NEXT ISSUE- AT THE HEARING TODAY. AND THE GENERAL LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT READ REFORM GOING FORWARD. SO WHAT ONE THING THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WHICH DIRECTIVES AND FLEXIBILITIES- MIGHT BE EXTENDED AT LEAST THROUGH THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. AYE MR WINFIELD- NOTED THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ALREADY CONSIDERING SORT OF A LONG TERM- USE OF SOME OF THESE DIRECTIVES BUT- I'M SORT OF GETTING AWAY FROM THAT THIRTY DAY AT A TIME- A RENEWAL MAY BE HELPFUL TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER. COMMUNITY AND WE ALSO JUST SUGGESTED THAT- THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO WORK WITH REGIONAL CENTERS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S EVEN APPLICATION OF THESE DIRECTIVES ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WE MOVE ON TO. MISTER ROGAN ANY RESPONSE THAT MR WINFIELD. YES THE DEPARTMENT IS AWARE THAT- THE THIRTY DAY EXTENSION SOME HAVE BEEN- DIFFICULT FOR OUR COMMUNITY- WITH THE EXECUTIVE THE DIRECTORS THAT ARE ISSUED OUT OF THE DIRECTOR THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. WE ARE LIMITED TO THIRTY DAYS AND SO WE TRIED TO- GET THOSE EXTENSIONS OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HISTORY AT WE'RE CONTINUING TO REFINE THAT PROCESS- THE DIRECTORS THAT ARE ISSUED UNDER OUR DIRECTOR'S AUTHORITY. FROM THE CHIEF INSTRUCTIONS CODE FOR CONSUMER RIGHTS AND HEALTH AND SAFETY THOSE DO NOT HAVE A THIRTY DAY. EXPIRATION AND SO THOSE ARE ARE MORE LONG TERM- AND IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. DEL VALLE- WE CAN THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE'VE PROVIDE TO THE COMMUNITY- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TRIED TO- JUST HELP PEOPLE TO. UNDERSTAND THAT- AS LONG AS IT HAD TO MAKE IS WITH US THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO REASSESS AND GAUGE IN REVERSE TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY TO ASSIST IN THE VISION OF SERVICE. SO WE HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD THAT COMES. AND THE AND WE'VE HEARD BEFORE BUT THE ISSUE OF- DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE REGIONAL CENTERS CAN YOU SPEAK TO YOUR ABILITY YOUR- I GUESS YOUR ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO. YES ONE ZERO AGE SO WE'RE NOT ALL JUST BUNDLING IN BUREAUCRACIES. I APOLOGIZE YES- AND SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE HAD THAT STATEWIDE TRAININGS ON ARTISTS AND DIRECTED SERVICES- AND- ISSUING I THINK RECALLING ASK QUESTIONS AND WHEN THERE ARE PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT- WE ARE MADE AWARE OF WE COME REACH OUT TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH REGIONAL CENTER- BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT. OUR SYSTEM IS UNIQUE AND THAT- IN THE- I MEAN FLEXIBILITY IS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL IS VERY HELPFUL FOR REGIONAL CENTERS BUT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE AND FAMILIES SO- WE ARE ASSESSING THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STATEWIDE TRAINING. AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE- IN ADDITION- WE ARE DEVELOPING. INFORMATIONAL PACKET- THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO. ALL INDIVIDUALS FOR GENERALLY STARTING LANOLIN ACTS SERVICES- SO EVERYONE WILL HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION WHEN THE INTO THE REGION CENTER SYSTEM SO ARE SOME WAYS THAT WE ARE WORKING TO. SUPPORT THESE ACTIONS. OKAY IT THANK YOU FOR. I'M SORRY FOR THIS THE SECOND WHO SAID WHO'S TALKED. POSTING THINGS ON YOUR WEBSITE. HOW MUCH TRAFFIC DO YOU GET ON YOUR WEBSITE. ACTUALLY WE GET A LOT OF. IN PART I'M VERY EXTENSIBLE AND HAVE TRANSLATED ITEMS INTO MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE EVEN AUDIO IN ASL- AND WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE IN FAMILIES SO WE FREQUENTLY HERE- FROM FOLKS THAT ARE WEBSITE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IN THE STATE ON THE AT THE INFORMATION USEFUL. OKAY BEFORE YOU MOVE ON TO MICHY TRUE THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO INSURE THAT WE HEAR FROM ATHLETES ARE BEING ON QUESTION NUMBER ONE THE CHIANG MAI DID NOT COVER. SHE TO. OKAY. APOLOGIES THAT WE ADDRESS YOUR QUESTIONS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF ORDER IN THE AGENDA TODAY MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FEATURE FRANCO WITH THE DEPARTMENT SHEETS FOR DATA ANALYTICS AND STRATEGY THERE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS DESCRIBED IN YOUR AGENDA DOES INCLUDE TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO FIND TWENTY ONE POSITIONS DEDICATED TO EMERGENCY PLANNING PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE AND RECOVERY- WE PROPOSE THAT THESE RESOURCES BEING DEDICATED OF COURSE DIRECTLY TO- SERVING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL. AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND IT USED TO COME. THE STATE EMERGENCY. CAPACITY OVERALL- WE ARE COORDINATING WITH- REGIONAL CENTERS ABOUT HOW BEST TO UTILIZE THESE RESOURCES WE RECOGNIZE THAT MEANS AND PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE OBVIOUSLY VERY- JUST AS DISASTERS- THEMSELVES VERY FROM WILDFIRES AND FLOOD THREATS AND POWER SHUT OFFS. AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- WE- WE KNOW AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS THE NEEDS OF OUR POPULATION ARE OFTEN VERY UNIQUE FROM THAT OF OTHER POPULATIONS. AND WE SEE A BIG NEED TO REFRESH PRIOR EFFORTS TO EDUCATE PEOPLE TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND AWARE TO SHELTER AND TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDERSTAND HOW TO HELP SHELTER AND FEED- TO DO THAT NECESSARY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. A COMMUNICATION MEMBERS TALKED A LOT ALREADY ABOUT THE EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND REGIONAL CENTERS TO DO IT IN AND CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE MANNERS WELL I AM STILL MAINTAIN THAT CONNECTION IN THE OVERALL STATE EMERGENCY FRAMEWORK- WE KNOW THAT EACH REGIONAL CENTER HAS A DIFFERENT CAPACITY- AND A DIFFERENT SE OFEXPERIENCES ALREADY HAND SO WE'RE TRYING TO FACTORED THOSE THAT ADDITIONAL BENEFIT INTO OUR PLANNING AS WELL. WELL WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF TASKS- THAT WE WOULD PROPOSE FOR THESE RESOURCES WELL WE KNOW THAT NO ONE PERSON CAN DO IT ALL AND BE THE MAGICIAN ARE UNNECESSARY. AND SOME MUTUAL AID AND SUPPORT IS ALSO A FEATURE OF OUR PLANNING AND CONVERSATION. THE ADVANCE PLANNING THAT WE CAN DO TO ADVANCE EDUCATION OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVING A PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS ALSO THAT WE'RE NOT MAKING COLD CALLS IN THE HEAT OF A MOMENT DEVELOPING TRAINING AND EXPERTISE THOSE AS A BASELINE SPECIALIZATION. HAVING A DEDICATED FROM POINT PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED- IN UTILIZATION. OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE. SYNALLOY ANOTHER. AND% THAT IS REALLY THE KEY TO ROUTE RID THE REST OF OUR- AND PROTECTING SINCE. ALSO I HAVE THIS SHORT OVERVIEW AND IT TO WHAT'S THE BOTTOM OF PAGE OF YOUR AGENDA TODAY. A LITTLE INSIGHT INTO THE COLLABORATIVE WORK WE'RE DOING THIS REGIONAL CENTERS WILL OF COURSE BE INVOLVING OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BEYOND THEM. POSE APPROVED WE THINK THERE'S A LOT. OF THOUGHT AND EXPERIENCE THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO HOW THESE RESOURCES ARE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AND UTILIZED. AND TO HELP US OF THOSE PLANS FOR- PREPARE PEOPLE. RESPOND AND RECOVER FROM THESE EMERGENCY OF ABSENT THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY JUST TO DESCRIBE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL THE PROPOSAL TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM MR GABRIEL BROGAN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NORTH ABOUT NORTH BAY REGIONAL CENTER. HERE FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE HOW THINGS ARE GOING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. NAME IS GABRIEL ROGAN AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NORTH BAY REGIONAL CENTER WHICH SERVES NAPA SOLANO AND SONOMA COUNTIES. MINISTERED BY TALKING ABOUT HOW OUR REGIONAL CENTER HAS ADAPTED TO COPE WITH NINETEEN AS WELL AS OTHER EMERGENCIES. SUCH AS THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES THAT HAVE IMPACTED OUR REGION AS WELL AS THE NUMEROUS PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. IT'S REALLY BEEN A COMMUNITY WIDE EFFORT BUT I'M GONNA TALK TODAY ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC THINGS ARE REGIONAL CENTER HAS DONE. FIRST IT STARTS WITH INCREASED OUTREACH TO OUR COMMUNITY. WE'VE INCREASED OUR REACH REALLY AT ALL LEVELS THE PEOPLE WE SERVE FAMILIES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. IN ORDER TO INSURE PEOPLE SAFETY MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE TIMELY INFORMATION. AND AUTHORIZED NECESSARY SERVICES. WE'VE DISTRIBUTED PP THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS AT ALL LEVELS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THE DEVELOP MULTIPLE SURGE HOUSING LOCATIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE OR WHO HAVE BEEN POTENTIALLY EXPOSED. WE'VE DEVELOPED A RAPID RESPONSE PROCESS WHEN VIRUS OUTBREAKS OCCUR IN OUR VENDOR LOCATIONS. WE'VE INVESTED IN IT INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO CONDUCT THEIR VISITS AND MONITORING ACTIVITIES REMOTELY AND WE'VE ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGY LENDING LIBRARY FOR OUR COMMUNITY. WE'RE ACTIVELY COORDINATING WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND PARTNERING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO INCREASE ACCESS TO KOBE TESTING ACROSS OUR THREE COUNTIES AND ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS ACCESS TO VACCINATIONS GOING FORWARD. THE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS- BUT I WOULD POINT TO ONE IN PARTICULAR AND THAT IS THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT STAFFING DISRUPTIONS WHEN COLGATE OUTBREAKS OCCUR IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE'VE BEEN VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S DIRECTIVES TO AUTHORIZE OVERTIME AND ENGAGE WITH LOCAL STAFFING AGENCIES TO ADDRESS ANY STAFFING GAPS OR SHORTAGES. GENERALLY SPEAKING IN MY OPINION THE DIRECTIVES ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY HELPFUL. FOR EXAMPLE ALLOWING SERVICE COORDINATION ACTIVITIES TO HAPPEN REMOTELY. ALLOWING SERVICES TO BE ROVIDED IN REMOTE LOCATIONS ARE ALTERNATE LOCATIONS WAIVING FEES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE BURDENSOME FOR FAMILIES AND AUTHORIZING REGIONAL CENTER DIRECTORS TO ADJUST RATES IN HEALTH AND SAFETY SITUATIONS. IN MY OPINION THE DEPARTMENT'S LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY THROUGHOUT THIS CRISIS. THEY'VE BEEN TRANSPARENT THEY'VE BEEN RESPONSIVE- THEY'VE BEEN COLLABORATIVE I AM IN FAVOUR STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE EMERGENCY. COORDINATION POSITIONS AT EACH REGIONAL CENTER I THINK THAT WILL BE CRITICAL TO OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE EFFORTS GOING FORWARD. I WOULD JUST ASK THAT THE SALARIES FOR THOSE POSITIONS BE COMMENSURATE WITH THE LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY NECESSARY FOR THOSE POSITIONS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN SUMMARY I WANT TO VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR THE BUDGET LETTER SUBMITTED BY PARKER. AND SPECIFICALLY ADVOCATE FOR DECREASES SERVICE COORDINATOR CASELOADS AT REGIONAL CENTERS THOSE POSITIONS ARE CRITICAL ALWAYS BUT ESPECIALLY NOW AS WE WORK TO ASSIST FAMILIES TO NAVIGATE THE MANY CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN OUR SYSTEM. AND AS WE STRIVE TO INCREASE EQUITY FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS OF DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS IN THE COMMUNITY AND ADVOCATE FOR INCREASED WAGES FOR THOSE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS THEY'VE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY TO SUPPORT OUR POPULATION THROUGHOUT THIS CRISIS. AND THEY ARE TRULY HEROES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M SUPPOSING HOW LONG WOULD YOU. THANK JUST THE% EMERGENCY DECLARATION TO GO FORWARD WITH BEING ABLE TO OPERATE REMOTELY WHICH ONES DO YOU THINK SHOULD LAST FOR LONGER THAN THE PANDEMIC. I THINK REGIONAL CENTER SHOULD BE PROVIDED THE FLEXIBILITY GOING FORWARD TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH EMPLOYEES INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND THE CONSENSUS IS IT REALLY DEPENDS. THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO REALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH REMOTE SERVICE DELIVERY AND THERE ARE OTHERS WHO STRONGLY WOULD PREFER THAT DELIVERY HAPPENS IN PERSON SO I WOULD ARGUE FOR FLEXIBILITY AND REALLY CUSTOMIZING OUR APPROACH BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. THANK YOU UP. MISTER MARK MELANSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LIVING NETWORK. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHAEL INSTANT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LIVING NETWORK WE ARE STATEWIDE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED PROVIDER MEMBERS LARGE AND SMALL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING SUPPORTED LIVING INDEPENDENT LIVING RESPITE PERSONAL ASSISTANCE IN PLANNING SERVICES. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE CHAIRED COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ESPECIALLY THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS FROM OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY TO KEEP PEOPLE HEALTHY AND SAFE THROUGHOUT THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS I MUST BEGIN BY ACKNOWLEDGING AND APPRECIATING THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND NANCY PARCHMENTS EFFORTS. AND THE COLLABORATION THAT SEES THE ALLEN HAS HAD AND CONTINUES TO HAVE WITH THEM YOU CAN IN SUCH DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TIMES AS WE ALL JUGGLE COMPETING PRIORITIES AS MR WINFIELD PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED EZLN ALWAYS APPRECIATES FROM WE HAVE TIME WITH YOU ALL. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE CHALLENGES THAT PROVIDERS OF IN PERSON SERVICES HAVE EXPERIENCED DURING THE DAM ENDEMIC AND WHAT CHALLENGES REMAIN CERTAINLY ALL OF OUR LIVES HAVE DRASTICALLY CHANGED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC CCL AND HELD A LEGISLATIVE BRIEFING IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TITLES IN PERSON SERVICES AND IT CAN DOWN. INTO OUR RECORDING CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE AT C. C. ON DOCK WORK THAT PROGRAM DETAILS HOW THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS OF IN PERSON SERVICES HAVE BEEN CRITICAL IN KEEPING CALIFORNIANS SAFE THROUGHOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WE WILL HEAR ALL ABOUT HOW IN PERSON SERVICES ROSE TO MEET A PANDEMIC. MOMENT IN A COVERT NINETEEN MINUTES. THE URGENT NEED MEDIA PER. OF MAINTAINING HEALTHY SAFETY STAFF THE PEOPLE SERVICE BEGAN ON DAY ONE. IN PERSON PROVIDERS HAS BECOME INFECTION CONTROL EXPERTS. IN SECURE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CLEANING AND SANITATION SUPPLIES. ALL WHILE PROVIDING INCREASED STAFFING CLIENT TRAINING. ALL OF THIS WAS AT A TREMENDOUS COST TO THE PROVIDERS IN THE NETWORK. FIRST QUESTION WAS WHEN STAFF SHOW UP FOR WORK. UNFORTUNATELY THEY DID. WE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO TRAIN ON HOW TO LOOK FOR SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF COPD NINETEEN AND DEVELOP DETAILED RESPONSE PLANS. AS LOCKDOWNS WERE IN IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE STATE PROVIDERS FOR MANAGING AND BALANCING DEMANDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF FAMILY VISITS IN THE CLIENT'S DESIRE TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR CHOSEN WAY OF LIFE. WE WERE ALREADY FACING A WORK FORCE CRISES. AND PROVIDERS INCREASE THEIR EFFORTS TO FIND WAYS TO ATTRACT RECRUIT RETRAIN RETAIN AND TRAIN NEW EMPLOYEES AND OUR NEW CORPORATE NINETEEN WORLDS. THAT INCLUDED MANAGING THE ALREADY COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP WITH IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES AND SCHEDULING AND RESCHEDULING ADEQUATE STAFFING COVERAGE BASED ON STAFF'S EXPOSURE. TEST POSITIVE FOR DOPING NINETEEN AND THE NEED FOR STAFF TO QUARANTINE. THE WORKFORCE CRISIS WHICH HAS BEEN A CRISIS BEFORE DURING AND IS STILL TRUE TODAY CONTINUES TO BE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR PROVIDERS OF IN PERSON SERVICES. WHAT ARE THE SOME OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS PROVIDERS HAVE HAD TO ADAPT AND CHANGE THEIR OPERATIONS DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THREE THE SHRINKING OF SUPPORT TEAMS WAS ESSENTIAL TO LIMIT EXPOSURE TO PROVIDE NINETEEN WEST STAFF IN AND OUT OF THE HOMES HE WAS LAST RESPECTS MOTION EVERYONE. COVERAGE FOR THE NATIONAL DAYTIME HOURS DURING THE DAY SERVICE WELL WISHERS. IN MANY CASES THE DAY SERVICES AND EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES SO THAT CLIENTS TO MAINTAIN THEIR PAID INTERNSHIPS AND EMPLOYMENT WHEN DAY SERVICE PROVIDERS WERE FORCED TO CLOSE AND DISCONTINUE SERVICES. INCREASING THE HOURS FOR RESPITE AND PERSONAL ASSISTANTS TO PROVIDE THE MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT AND RELIEF TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER AND SAFE. COORDINATING MULTIPLE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER REQUESTS FOR MULTIPLE CLIENTS MULTIPLE REGIONAL CENTERS. FOR INCREASING THE HOURS OF SUPPORT AND FOR COVERING THE COST OF THE DRAMATICALLY INCREASING OVER TIME. PLANTS WITH NEW SICK LEAVE MANDATES AND ARRANGING AND REARRANGING COVERAGE NEEDS ACCORDINGLY. AND PREPARING FOR THE MOUNTING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AS A RESULT OF ISOLATION LOSS OF ROUTINES AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS TO THE BLOCK DOWNS IN THE SHELTERS IN PLACE. NOW WE'RE FOCUSED ON VACCINE. ARE THERE STATE SPECIFIC DIRECTIVES THAT HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY BENEFICIAL TO PROVIDERS. YES EXTREMELY HELPFUL WHILE CRITICAL AND WELL INTENDED INTERPRETATION'S IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THE GPS DIRECTIVES DOES VARY WILDLY THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE AS MRS HANNEKE MENTIONS. AS A STATEWIDE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION WE HAVE A VAST DIFFERENCES FROM- ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED PROVIDER MEMBERS BUNDLING BARACK BUREAUCRACIES WAS A FAIR STATEMENT NOT AND SHARE. THE DIRECTORS MUST BE MORE SPECIFIC INTEREST PERSPECTIVE NOT JUST ISSUED AS GUIDANCE THEY MUST PROVIDE FOR FLEXIBILITY FOR EXCEPTIONS AND SHOULD NOT BE USED TO DENY ACCESS. TO SERVICE OUR FUNDING FOR PROVIDERS. THE VIRTUAL SUPPORT DIRECTED. FOR IOS THAT ALLOWED FOR REMOTE SUPPORT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE IN FACT EXPECTED. ALTHOUGH IT MUST NOT BE EXCLUSIVE ENFORCING SUPPORTS THE DIRECTIVES HAS COMPLIMENTED AND INCREASE THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE AND IMPROVE THE OUTCOME FOR THE PEOPLE SERVED ESPECIALLY HEALTH AND SAFETY OUTCOMES. THIS WOULD BE A DIRECTOR THAT ALLOWED FOR HYBRID IN FOR A HYBRID OF IN PERSON AND VIRTUAL SUPPORTS THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND CONTINUE POST PANDEMIC. THE ISOLATION RATE DIRECTIVES FOR SLS WAS RELEASED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FINALLY ALLOWED FOR A COMPETITIVE WAGE FOR A DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. WHILE THE DIRECTOR OF PREVENTION OR EARLIER OR AT LEAST BEEN WRECKED MAKE RETROACTIVE BACK TO MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TO MAKE PROVIDERS HOLE AS THEY CREATE COURAGEOUSLY COMBAT THE CHALLENGES THEY FAE BY THE PANDEMIC. OUR PROVIDER OF NEW AREN'T OUR PROVIDER NETWORK IS GRATEFUL FOR THE DIRECTOR. DIRECTIVE EXPANDING THE ACCESS TO THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM OFFERED MORE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE CERTAIN FAMILIES. AND ALTHOUGH NOT A DIRECT IF THE VACCINE THAT IS PROVIDED FOR STAFF AND FAMILIES ISSUED BY DPS WILL GREATLY APPLY. APPLAUDED BY OUR NETWORK AND PEOPLE SERVED. IN CLOSING THE PANDEMIC HAS ONLY HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR A FOCUS ON THE FUTURE. THE NEED FOR OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY TO COME TOGETHER FOR COORDINATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE EFFORTS AND ANY TYPE OF CRISIS SERVICE FASTER. I DO WANT TO TAKE JUST A BRIEF MOMENT TO HUNDRED DREXEL PROFESSIONAL PASSED AWAY LAST MONTH. NOT DIRECTLY DUE TO TRANSMITTING CODED NINETEEN BUT OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO OPEN NINETEEN. MATTHEW MATTY. JOHN STANTON DEDICATED TWENTY TWO YEARS OF HIS CAREER TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AMONG US WAS ONE OF THE FIRST RECIPIENTS. OF THE FIRST ROUND OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LIVING NETWORKS DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL YEAR RECOGNITION AWARD. BECAUSE OF MADDIE YES PLEASE JUST LIKE NINETY THAT YOU SEE ON THE CONTINUED FIGHT FOR RATIONALIZING THE WORK FORCE IN DEMANDING COMPETITIVE WAGES. PROVIDERS MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY STAFF EDITOR WAGE. IT'S OUR WORKFORCE THAT CONNECTS THE PEOPLE SERVED WITH THE ACCESS POINTS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THEIR CHOSEN WAY OF LIFE. WE ARE NOTHING WITHOUT THEM. WE MUST PAY THEM ACCORDINGLY AND ELIMINATE THE SUNSET SUSPENSION LANGUAGE THAT YOU CAN POINT TO SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES TO STABILIZING FOR PROVIDERS. IN A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES. AND FINALLY AS ALWAYS INCREASE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND IDENTIFYING THE QUALITY MEASURABLE OUTCOMES THE PEOPLE SERVED TO ACHIEVE THEIR CHOSEN WAY OF LIFE. CCL AND SPONSORED BILL AB EIGHT ONE THREE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MALEMA MOVE US IN THAT NECESSARY DIRECTION TOWARDS THOSE QUALITY MEASURABLE OUTCOMES.

AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. WEDNESDAY'S. PANEL HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MUCH AND YOU. FOR VERY VIVIDLY. WITH YOUR PICKS PAINTED WORDS BRINGING- BRINGING THE PROVIDERS INTO THE ROOM WITH US WE APPRECIATE IT AND- YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE DIFFICULTIES OF TRYING TO. MAINTAIN SERVICES TO A VULNERABLE POPULATION. DURING A PANDEMIC AND WE THANK YOU AND MISTER ROGAN FOUR YEAR- ALL THE DEPARTMENTS BUT BUT THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE DOING THE WORK. RIGHT ON THE GROUND. WE THANK YOU- BELIAU ANY ANY FURTHER. QUESTIONS REMARKS AFTER THESE PRESENTATIONS DEPARTMENT. HERE OKAY. ALL RIGHT- I THINK WE CERTAINLY HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US TONIGHT- I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO REITERATE I THINK THINK THE DIFFERENT THE- THE IMPORTANCE OF. A PLANNING- FOR THE NEXT DECADE WE'VE I THINK WE'VE ALL ACKNOWLEDGED THE SETBACKS THAT WE'VE HAD. DURING THE PANDEMIC AND I THINK WE WERE SLOW ON PLANNING FOR THIS POPULATION PRIOR TO THAT THE PANDEMIC AND NOW COMING OUT I THINK WE'VE WE'VE ALL SEEN HOW. THE SHAKY GROUND THAT WE STAND ON AND THE NEED ESPECIALLY. IN DEALING WITH PEOPLE WITH WITH ID AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE FOR CREATING A FIRM FOUNDATION SO PEOPLE CAN BEGIN TO PLAN. AND FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING. DR PAN. THANK YOU AND- APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATIONS- YES- WE A COUPLE COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL- I A DO YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT A FOLLOW UP ON THE L. A. AS- FINE- REPORT AROUND THE US. I GUESS THE LACK OF CERTAINTY FOR DS PROVIDERS AND- APPRECIATE THAT THE APARTMENTS. TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT BUT IT DID GETS REALLY HARD TO PLAN IF YOU KNOW YOUR FLEXIBILITY IT'S THE ONLY. TO TOLD FOR THIRTY DAYS MAYBE CELLS IT WILL PROBABLY LONGER THAN THAT IT'S ADDRESS SO I'D BE GREAT TO HAVE SOME- SOME BETTER FEEDBACK ON. BOTH THE IDEA OF WHAT CATHOLICS BELIEVE CAN BE COMMITTED TO THROUGHOUT UNTIL THE END OF C. TO MERCHANTS AND ALSO WHICH ONES THAT SEEM LIKE IT. WILL YOU KNOW THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE BEYOND RIGHT THAT MAKES SENSE THAT THIS IS THE WAY WE SHOULD PERHAPS- THIS WE CAN NORMALLY DO BUSINESS THAT THIS. X. EASIER ON FAMILIES THAT ALLOWS US TO BE MORE EFFICIENT SO FORTH SO- I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET A- REPORT BACK FROM THE DEPARTMENT- BUT I NEED. YOU KNOW PLEASE BEFORE MAY REVISE ON ON ON THOSE PARTICULAR POINTS- THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE AND I KNOW THAT- OUR CHAIR AND ASKED ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE VISITED- DDS WEBSITE. I WOULD MAKE A NOTE THAT THAT QUESTION WASN'T ACTUALLY ANSWERED- YOU YOU. THAT THE ANSWER WAS THAT WE HAVE A WONDERFUL WEBSITE THAT HAS A LOT OF WONDERFUL RESOURCE ISN'T AS ACCESSIBLE AND SO FORTH. FREESHEET THAT. BUT THE QUESTION ACTUALLY WAS HOW MANY PEOPLE VISIT THE WEBSITE. AND THE REASON I'M SORT OF GOING BACK TO THAT IS THAT I'M SURE DEPARTMENT ALSO USES OTHER MECHANISMS BUT SOMETIMES- IN TERMS OF HOW WE COMMUNICATE- YOU KNOW POSTING THINGS ON A WEBSITE CERTAINLY IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE AS A REFERENCE BUT- OFTENTIMES DOES NOT REFLECT THE WAY FOR PEOPLE TO FIND OUT NOT SURE DEPARTMENT ALSO HAS OTHER MECHANISMS WHERE MORE PROACTIVELY GETS INFORMATION OUT TO PEOPLE- BUT- AGAIN IF. YOU'RE HAVING A SITUATION WHERE- YOU KNOW YES. BUT ARE. THE FIRST SHORTAGE OF TIME THERE'S UNCERTAINTY OF FUNDING AND SO FORTH. HAVING A MORE- IF PROACTIVE ENGAGED- FORMA TV CATIONS IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE- INSTEAD OF A MORE PASSIVE WAY WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO FIND THE INFORMATION INSTEAD OF INFORMATION BEING PUT IN FRONT OF THEM. THAT'S RELEVANT TO THEM SO- SO TO GET A WOULD APPRECIATE THAT- DEPARTMENT PERHAPS FOLLOWING UP WE DON'T NEED THE ANSWER RIGHT NOW BUT- ON HOW IT'S GOING ABOUT DOING IT AND I'M SURE I KNOW THAT YOU DO MORE THAN JUST PUT THINGS ON THE WEBSITE BUT- WE WANT WE WANNA BE SURE THAT- THE VARIOUS PROVIDERS AND CLIENTS ARE ARE. ARE ABLE TO EASE MORE EASILY GET INFORMATION THAT WAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS ANIMAL IT IS. I DON'T SEE YOUR HAND UP. SO I'M GOING TO. THEN TAKE A SOUND ISSUE NUMBER THREE EXTENSION OF FUNDING A PROPOSED. FINJAN OF FUNDING PROPOSED FOR SUSPENSION. SURE STEVEN PAUL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES IF I COULD JUST- QUICKLY- TOUCH AN ISSUE TO- ON THE DIRECTIVES YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT HONESTLY DIRECTORS HAVE PROVIDED DDS WITH LOOKS ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE PANDEMIC. NUMBER ALLOWED US TO QUICKLY RESPOND TO US AND MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AND- NO WE'RE STILL LEARNING WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T AND SO I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR THERE IS SOME CONCERN WITH THE POTENTIALLY CODIFYING THESE DIRECTIVES- THE FEMALE LIMITED DEPARTMENTS. FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND A IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE DIRECTIVES AND- WORKS. FOR TO THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ON THIS MATTER- WITH THE WITH THE GARCIA ISSUE- NUMBER THREE- SO FINANCE WAS ASKED TO. PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE SUSPENSION PROPOSALS. AND THEN SECONDLY WHETHER THE SUSPENSION FRAMEWORK IS INTENDED TO BE ON GOING- AS NOTED AND THEN GENDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES- ONE YEAR EXTENSION OF THE SUPPLEMENT OWN PROVIDER RATE INCREASE. AND THAT'S A TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION- TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE. POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND. ALSO EXTENSION OF UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE SUSPENSION. THAT'S A TOTAL OF FIFTY FIVE POINT NINE MILLION. THIRTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND- SO GIVEN THE FORECAST OF STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IN THE MULTI YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THIS QUESTION TO GO INTO EFFECT ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. OZ PENSION WOULD BE LIFTED IF THE ADMINISTRATION DETERMINES THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY TO BUDGET ACT PROCESS. THAT THERE'S SUFFICIENT GENERAL FUND REVENUE SUPPORT ALSO BEEN A PROGRAMS AND SUBSEQUENT TO FISCAL YEARS. IDC'S REFLECT SIMILAR COACH DOC BY THE MINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE EMPIRE BUDGETS- TO THE SECOND QUESTION- I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW ANY FUTURE CHANGES TO SUSPENSION FRAMEWORK- WOULD BE EVALUATED REEVALUATED THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET BUDGET PROCESS. AND WE ARE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE AND WE WELCOME- CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE- AND NOW WITHOUT CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS INTEGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DDS ARE YOU PRESENTING ON THIS AS WELL. YES HI MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND STAFF THIS IS JIM MIKE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES- BEEN ASKED IN A GENDER TO DISCUSS THE PLAN TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES FACING THE DEVELOPMENT SERVICE THE SYSTEM. THIS IMPORTANT QUESTION AS WE LOOK TO IDENTIFY WHAT'S NEEDED FOR A SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM THAT FOCUSES ON THE NEEDS AND PREFERENCES OF THOSE TO RECEIVE SERVICES. I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE AND HOW WE'VE ADDRESSED PREVIOUS CHALLENGES AS WE'RE GOING TO BUILD ON THAT THOSE EXPERIENCES AS WE MOVE FORWARD. OVER THE YEARS WHAT'S NOW THAT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE HAS BEEN A VALUABLE RESOURCE TO HELP INFORM SIGNIFICANT CHANGES INCLUDING. EXPANDING SERVICE OPTIONS FOR FORMER RESIDENTS OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY. CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON THE WILL ON WAYS TO STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IN THE COMMUNITY. IN JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF EXPANDING AND DIVERSIFYING THE TASK FORCE AND SERVE TO NOW CURRENTLY WE HAVE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE IN THIS WORK GROUPS. AND SOME OF THOSE GROUPS INCLUDE- THOSE THAT FOCUS ON COMMUNITY RESOURCE SAYS AND SYSTEM AND FISCAL REFORM. OBVIOUSLY THE PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT SOME CHALLENGES THAT THAT WEREN'T ORIGINALLY ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED BY THE TASK FORCE. BUT WHEN WE BEGAN BUT WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE GUIDANCE OF STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY SOME OPTIONS. TO ADDRESS THE CHANGING NEEDS. AND ONE OF THOSE APPS OPTIONS THAT WAS- REFERENCED EARLIER WAS IMPLEMENTATION OF ALTERNATIVE SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL. AND THIS ALLOWS FOR SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY AND NOT ONLY LIVERY BUT TO RECEIVE SERVICE SAYS THAT ARE ADAPTABLE TO INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. AND WE COLLECTIVELY LEARNED DURING THIS TIME THAT SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITIES AND CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY ARE WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION FOR CONTINUED LONG TERM. AS MR WINFIELD MENTIONED EARLIER WE'RE WORKING ON- SHE REGULATIONS TO MAKE PERMANENT THE EXPANSION OF SOME OF THE SERVICES. THAT CAN BE ACCESSED THROUGH PURCHASE SPEND DIRECTION AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT OPTIONS. FOR THE REMOTE DELIVERY OF SOME SERVICES. NOW AS NOTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THAT THE TASK FORCE. TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SHORT AND LONG TERM SERVICE OPTIONS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALTERNATIVE SERVICES INTENDED AS JUST ONE STEP THAT'S GOING TO HELP INFORM SOME LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS. AND THOSE SOLUTIONS ARE GONNA FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ALSO THEN WE HAVE TO EXPLORE PAYMENT STRUCTURES THAT ARE GOING TO SUPPORT DOES ANOTHER PRIORITY AS WELL AS COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL FUNDING RULES SUCH AS THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES SETTINGS ROLE. A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS WITH THAT PARTICULAR- THE HOME THE CENTRAL IS CONTINUED OUTREACH AND TRAINING. REGARDING PERSON CENTER PLANNING AND PRACTICES BECAUSE THAT FORMS THE BASIS FOR MILLION DOLLARS FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO BUILD ON WHAT WE'VE LEARNED PRIOR TO AND DURING THE PANDEMIC. TELL CONFORM THOSE LONG TERM SERVICE AND SUPPORT OPTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M IS FINISHED PRODUCT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATE HEADED FOR THE L. A. O. WE HAVE JUST WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSED SUSPENSION OF SUPPLEMENTAL PROVIDER RATES FIRST WE WOULD NOT THAT THE SUSPENSIONS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION ARE ACROSS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS NOT JUST DDS BUT MEDI CAL IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES CHILD WELFARE IT CETERA. THESE REALLY ARE CORPS ONGOING- GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND THE POSSIBLE PROPOSED AS MENTIONS REALLY TREAT THEM AS TEMPORARY. THIS CREATES A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE GDS SYSTEM IT MAKES IT HARD FOR PROVIDERS TO BUDGET AND PLAN INCLUDING- HIRING AND RETAINING STAFF. THE L. A- RECOMMENDS REJECTING THE PROPOSED NEW SUSPENSION LANGUAGE ACROSS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS- GIVEN THE STATE'S A MULTI YEAR DEFICITS- PERPER PROJECTED DEFICITS RATHER THE STATE WILL LIKELY NEED TO MAKE CHANGES TO ITS BUDGET WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AS IT STANDS THE STATE COULD PROBABLY NOT AFFORD THE EXISTING PROGRAMS AVOID THE SUSPENSIONS AND FUND ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA OF THE GENERAL FUND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REJECTING THE PROPOSED NEW SUSPENSION LANGUAGE FOR THE TWO DDS ITEMS ARE ESTIMATED AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILLION. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TO REJECT THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE ACROSS ALL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS WOULD ADD COST RELATIVE TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S MULTI YEAR OUTLOOK. OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND ONE POINT NINE BILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. HOWEVER BY ACCEPTING AND TREATING- THESE COSTS AS ONGOING. THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE COMPENSATING COMPENSATING BUDGET CHOICES WITH THE BENEFIT OF FULL INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THESE ONGOING PROGRAMS COST THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NIGHT I THINK. FROM THE HEARING WE HAD LAST WEEK ALSO AND WE TALKED ABOUT- SUSPENSION AND THEN TO THIS WEEK. IN THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD ABOUT A LACK OF CERTAINTY AND THE INABILITY TO PLAN AND THE NEED TO RAISE RATES SO WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS TO DO THE VERY IMPORTANT WORK I THINK THAT WE ALL AGREE WOULD NEED TO BE NONE THAT A BUDGET MUST BE MADE WITH- SOME LEVEL OF CERTAINTY AN- EXISTING IN REALITY. SO I THINK UP SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THOSE TWO THINGS DON'T ALWAYS THEY'RE NOT LINED UP IN SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE SEE AND I WOULDA I THINK I WOULD SPEAK FOR- ACROSS THE AISLE WHEN WE SAY. THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BUDGET THAT PEOPLE CAN COUNT ON THE CERTAINTY THAT IS BASED IN REALITY OF WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA CUT AND NOT CUT DOWN AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE- SO I WOULD I WOULD SAY I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO REVISITING HOW WE DO THIS. A DIFFERENT. I THANK YOU AND I THINK I'VE RAISED THIS ISSUE MULTIPLE TIMES BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT THIS IS PRIMARILY TOLD THE USE AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND STALE POINT OUT SO- AND BY THE WAY THIS IS NOT A GOOD TOOL SO I'M NOT SUGGESTING WE USE IT. ANYWHERE ELSE- BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE BUILT IN CUTS. THAT WE WILL EACH YEAR DECIDE WHETHER WE WILL NOT EXECUTE. FOR JUST HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SIGNIFICANT CUTS. AND SO WE TALK A BUDGETS IS BEING PRIORITIES- WE DON'T DO THAT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET. WE JUST WE MAINLY DO THIS AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND I THINK IT FORTUNATELY IT SENDS I THINK. TO BE A WRONG MESSAGE ABOUT HOW MUCH WE VALUE- SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN WE DO THIS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK SORT OF HAPPENED AFTER THE LAST GREAT RECESSION AND THOSE KIND OF A TOOL TO ITS ERA BUT AND IT DOES DISTORT THE WAY WE LOOK AT OUT YEARS TO AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE TRY TO DO YOU KNOW WE OUGHT WE TO DO A RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING WE'VE PUT IN MANY MEASURES ACTUALLY- TO ENSURE THAT- WE HAVE- FUNDS TO. TO HELP US THROUGH THE BAD TIMES- IN FACT ACTUALLY MADE THE ACTIONS WE JUST TOOK TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AND TO HELP INDIVIDUALS AND SO FORTH. OR BECAUSE OF A PRUDENT BUDGETING. THAT WE'VE DONE- BUT BY BUILDING IN THE SUSPENSIONS AND THEN. SORT OF. PROJECTING THAT WE WERE A QUOTE ACTUALLY GONNA MAKE THESE CUTS- OUT INTO IT OUT YEARS NO MATTER WHAT THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. AND THEN SAYING THAT WILL EACH YEAR WILL REEVALUATE YES OF COURSE WE VALUE IN EVERY PART OF THE BUDGET EACH YEAR BUT THE BILL THEN AUTOMATIC CUTS. INTO THE AND THEN COOKED SUSPEND THEM ONE YEAR AT A TIME I THINK IS- IN INTO POTENTIALLY JUST LIKE YOU DON'T HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGAIN I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD DO IT ACROSS THE BUDGET THAT'S NOT ONE SUGGESTING BY ANY MEANS. I THINK IS AN APPROPRIATE AND- WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE. A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS TO ME VERY BAD HABIT WE'VE GONE INTO AS A STATE IN TERMS OF OUR BUDGETING PRACTICES WE'VE DEVELOPED A LIFE BREAK A LOT OF VERY GOOD HABITS IN MY TIME THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE ALSO DAHLE SOME BAD HABITS AND THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE WORST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISS MELINDA'S. COMMENTS I DON'T SEE YOUR HAND. NOT SURE YOU'RE STILL WITH US. OKAY I'M HERE NO COMMENTS FROM ME THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY- NOW WE HAVE- JORDAN LINDSEY-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR. DR PAN SENATOR MELENDEZ MY NAME IS JORDAN LINDSAY I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE R. CAN UNITED CEREBRAL PALSY CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION WE REPRESENT FAMILIES OF CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOP DISABILITIES AND R. TWENTY TO R. CHAPTERS ELEVEN YOU SEE P. AFFILIATES ACROSS THE STATE- MANY OF MY COMMENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED BY YOU DR PAN AND OTHERS IN THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE INCREDIBLY THANKFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS TAKING A STAND AGAINST THE SUSPENSION OF THESE TRUCKS AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. I LIKE TO DISCUSS THE SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR SYSTEM OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH IDG DURING THE PANDEMIC AND BEYOND- FIRST WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES RETAINER PAYMENTS DURING THE- PANDEMIC ND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION FOR INCREASED UTILIZATION FOR IN PERSON SERVICES AND THAT SERVICE TO STABILIZE SERVICE DELIVERY SO THAT WE COLLECTIVELY CAN MOVE OUR FOCUS AWAY FROM RETAINING OUR STAFF AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON ON MOBILIZING A RESPONSE. AND ALLOW US TO DO THAT AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. ALSO I WANT TO MENTION THAT. THIS RESPONSE THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC FROM PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IT HAPPENED BY A SYSTEM THAT IS ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS UNDER FONG. AND I JUST WANTTO SAY IMAGINE THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE WE COULD HAVE RIGHT NOW IF WE HADN'T BEEN HOLDING NON BIASED IN THREAD FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES. THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMMUNITY FOUGHT HARD TO REDUCE THIS UNDERFUNDING FROM ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION TO ONE POINT FOUR BILLION AND THIS SUBCOMMITTEE WAS ESPECIALLY INSTRUMENTAL IN SECURING THOSE NEEDED INVESTMENTS. AND WE WERE COMPACT RIVER WE WERE PREPARED TO MAKE MORE PROGRESS THIS YEAR TO IMPLEMENT. THE RATE STUDY. BUT I IMPLORE THE COMMITTEE IN THE MINISTRATION TO CONSIDER THIS PANDEMIC AS ONLY A PAUSE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY. OTHERWISE THIS WOULD BE YET ANOTHER CONFIRMATION ANOTHER STUDY THAT CONFIRMS YES CALIFORNIA'S UNDERFUNDING INDIVIDUALS ID DE THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR SUPPORT STAFF. BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT. I WANT TO DISCUSS QUICKLY BY UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE THE BACKGROUND IN YOUR AGENDA IS FANTASTIC- THIS WASA CUT FROM- THE RECESSION ERA TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE. AND UNIFIED HOLIDAY SCHEDULES A BIT OF A MISNOMER IN THIS PARTICULAR CUT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED THE LAST FEW YEARS IN THIS COMMITTEE QUITE A BIT ON A MORE APPROPRIATE NAMES FURLOUGH DAYS FORCED FOR LOADED. IN SO THREE THINGS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY GREGIS ABOUT FORCED FURLOUGH DAYS RIGHT NOW ALL OR THESE ONE AFTER ORDER DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS PERFORMED FOR ROAD CLEAN WHICH YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ALREADY. DANIEL ARE WE GOING TO TURN AROUND AND SAY THANK YOU. FOR YOUR KAROQ EFFORTS TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND NOW WE'RE GOING. TO FOR LOW YOU FOR DAYS WITHOUT PAY. CHIU THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF PERSON CENTERED SERVICES THE ASSUMPTION THAT EVERY REGIONAL CENTER CLIENT CAN BE WITH OUT COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. FOR THE SAME FOURTEEN DAYS REGARDLESS OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT SITUATION FAMILY SITUATION LIVING SITUATION AND NOW REGARDLESS OF THEIR ONLINE CONNECTIVITY SITUATION. THAT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE DIRECTION OF OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM THAT THE DIRECTION OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM WANTS TO MOVE IN. AND THEN FINALLY ABOUT UNIFORM QUALITY SCHEDULE OR MORE CORPORATE NAMES FORCE FURLOUGH DAYS. COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC WE SHOULD BE MAKING EVERY EFFORT POSSIBLE TO BRING NORMALCY BACK ESPECIALLY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS NORMALCY TO SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR PEOPLE DISABILITIES. WE SHOULD NOT BE TAKING AWAY DAYS OF SERVICE AT THIS TIME. THE SUSPENSION PROPOSAL FOR THE RATES INCREASE AND YOUR FROM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE IN THE JANUARY BUDGET. SAYS TO US A COMMUNITY YES WE CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE HUGELY UNDERFUNDED YES WE KNOW THAT OUR COMMUNITY YOUR COMMUNITY HAS STRUGGLED ENORMOUSLY THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. BUT NEXT YEAR WE'RE LIKELY TO TAKE AWAY MORE MONEY AWAY FROM YOU BY ENACTING THE SUSPENSION OF ANY PROGRESS YOU MAKE. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IN THE AGENDA FROM THE L. A. L. ABOUT THIS- WE APPRECIATE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY CENTER PRO TEN ATKINS- SENATOR SKINNER. THE COMMENTS MANAGER YOU JUST MADE A DOCTOR IN THE COMMENTS YOU'VE JUST MADE- ESPECIALLY THE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THIS IS ONLY FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- THESE. SUSPENSION CUTS ARE ONLY IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECTOR- YOU HAVE ALL PUSHED BACK ON THIS STATUTE. AND YOU HAVE EMPHASIZED THAT THE LANE AND CUT IN SERVICES ONE YEAR ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. A SUSPENSION OF ONLY SERVES TO CREATE MORE UNCERTAINTY AND MORE ANXIETY IN A TIME. WHEN CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR SUPPORT STAFF DESPERATELY NEEDS STABILITY. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ALL THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK WE SEE YOU WE HEAR YOU- AND IT'S NOT MAY YET WE'LL BE COMING BACK AGAIN OKAY ANYMORE. THE DOCTRINE PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- I DID WANT TO TOUCH PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE- AND BEFORE I GO THERE ME ONE LAST COMMENT ON THE SUSPENSION- CAN YOU IMAGINE. S. CONTRACTING WITH A COMPANY TO HELP IMPROVE ONE OF OUR ROADS AND TRANSPORTATION AND TELL THEM OH BY THE WAY WE'RE GONNA PAY THIS MUCH FOR EXAMPLE TO HAVE BUT THAT'S A 10% YOU KNOW OUR 15% STANCHION AND SO NEXT YEAR. WE YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY WILL PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BUT WE DON'T WE MIGHT GIVE YOU CONTRACT YOU HAVE. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE THAT CONTRACT. BUT YET WE EXPECT OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE PROFESSIONALS TO ACCEPT THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THE CLIENTS THAT THEY ACTUALLY WILL. BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS- I WOULD ALSO JUST MAKE NOTE THAT- THAT ON THE RATE STUDY I A MEMBERS CHAIR OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. WE'RE TOLD- THAT WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT STUDY WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE WAIT STUDY THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT STUDY AND WE FOUND OUT HOW MUCH WE'RE UNDERFUNDING. AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT- AS IS MENTIONED THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS WHAT HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE RATE STUDY THAT TRY TO ADDRESS THE GAPS IN FACT PRIOR TO THE- TO COVE IT WE EVEN HAD A HEARING. TO GO OVER THAT RATE STUDY AND- AND TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO ADDRESS WHAT WE FOUND AND WHAT STUDY AFTER ALL WE ONLY WAITED HOW MANY YEARS TO ACTUALLY GET STUDY AND ACTUALLY PUT. THE AND IT SAID LATE WE'RE YOU KNOW TREMENDOUSLY UNDER FUNDING. AND THEN- THE NOT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT SO- APPRECIATE THAT WITH CODED THAT- IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING BUT WE DO NEED TO BE SURE WE KEEP ON TRACK- ON DATA AND THEN ALSO IF NECESSARY UPDATE ANY INFORMATION WE HAVE ON THE RATE STUDY THAT'S NOT THAT OLD YET. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY TO- CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP- AND ASK FOR PROGRESS ON TRYING TO ACHIEVE. SOMETHING APPROPRIATE- PAYMENT IS WE'VE- AS WE TRIED TO DO WITH THROUGH THAT RIGHT STUDY SO- AND I ALSO- SO ONE EXPRESS MY- OPPOSITION TO THE FORCED FURLOUGHS- WHICH WAY I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT WE'RE SUSPENDING FOR THIS YEAR BUT I THINK WE SHOULD JUST END IT ALL TOGETHER- THAT THAT THAT'S ENOUGH AND IF WE DECIDE THAT SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO THAT AND- LET'S. CONSCIOUSLY MAKE THAT DECISION BUT LET'S NOT PUT ON AUTO PILOT THAT THAT SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY GOING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM'S IMPLEMENTATION DATE. WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN ERIN CARRUTHERS. I BELIEVE. MISTER FILL YOU BACK WITH US. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN'T. THANK YOU I'LL BE PROVIDING A RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS ON EIGHT FIFTEEN OF THE AGENDA REGARDING SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. AS OF FEBRUARY NINETEENTH THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED NINETY NINE REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS WHO HAVE TRANSITIONED INTO THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. A REGIONAL CENTERS TO REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT MONTHLY ON MILESTONES AT THE BEACH BY THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRANSITIONING INTO THE PROGRAM AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WHO TRANSITION. IN WHILE THE DATA SHOW ENOUGH TREND IN THE NUMBER OF SELECT PURCHASE THAT HAVE A- TO A PROGRAM- I COMPARISON IF YOU LOOK AT THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE'RE JUST OVER A HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS. WHO HAD- STARTED THEIR SERVICES THROUGH SELF SELF DETERMINATION ALSO WE HAVE SEEN OR ARE YOU INCREASE OVER THE PAST YEAR- IT'S HARD TO TELL WHAT COMPANY WHAT IS THAT CODE HAS HAD ON. TRANSITION INTO THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM WE HAVE HEARD ANECDOTALLY THAT THE FLEXIBILITY SAID IT AFFORDS INDIVIDUALS- HAS- HASTENED THEIR- TRANSITION INTO THE PROGRAM. WE ALSO HAVE HER BACK- THE DEPARTMENT'S DIRECTIVE WE'VE ENOUGH FINANCIAL SERVICES FEES FROM THE- BUDGET HAS ALSO BEEN HELPFUL TO PARTICIPANTS WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM FOLKS SAYING FACTORED INTO PANDEMIC. I'M GIVING YOU ALL OF THE FAMILY JUST WASN'T READY TO TRANSITION DURING THIS TIME. AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO. MONITOR AND WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM. TO US AND SIGN- SO THOUGH- IT HASN'T OVER THE TWELVE MONTHS OR A LOT OF IMPROVE AND WE CAN. AS A STATE AGENCY AND OUR- AUGUST THE STATE WHY TO. ADVISORY COMMITTEES. FOR SOME OF WHICH HAVE UNTIL- WE ALSO. HAVE FRIDAY AND CONSULTANT MORE FOR FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM IT'S BEEN A SAYS THAT'S- AND WE ALSO RECEIVING TECHNICAL. FROM NATIONALS OF STATE OF DECEMBER SERVICES TO. AND OF ITSELF. ON A WASTE YOU SOME OF THE YEARS THAT CAN A WHOLE AROUND LAST. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH THIS S WHAT EVENTUALLY- SO THAT YOU CAN GET FROM THE PLAN THAT'S REFERENCED IN THE- BUDGET WITH STEPS INSTEAD TO THE GOALS OF SUBJECT. PROGRAM AND WITH EVERYONE INVOLVED AND WE INTEND TO DEVELOP AND THAT SUPPORTS WATER ACTIVE CREATION. OF THE SELF DETERMINATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS CARRUTHERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SANDERS APPEARING CARRUTHERS THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THE STATE COUNCIL WAS A CO SPONSOR OF THE ORIGINAL SELF DETERMINATION LEGISLATION IN MANY ROLES IN HELPING MAKE THIS PROGRAM A SUCCESS THE TWO OF THOSE ROLES INCLUDE OVERSIGHT- WE CAN BE A STATE WIDE BODY OF THE CHAIRS OF EACH OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS LOCAL SUB TO TERMINATION BY THREE COMMITTEES. WHICH MR WINFIELD ARE DISCUSSED WE'RE ALSO TO EVALUATE THE PROGRAM AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON PRISTINE SATISFACTION AND IMPLEMENTATION SO FROM THE NUMBERS ON PAGE SIXTEEN IN IN YOUR COMMITTEE PACKET MOST REPORTED BY MR WINFIELD THE IMPLEMENTATION IS SLOW I'M SPECIALLY SLOW DURING THIS INITIAL PHASE IN PERIOD. OF THE THIRTY THREE HUNDRED NAMES THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN FOR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SLOTS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY NINE PEOPLE HAVE FULLY TRANSITIONED FROM THE TRADITIONAL REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE PROGRAM INTO THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM SO AFTER ALMOST. THREE YEARS THAT'S ABOUT 20% THE QUESTION IS ON MY AS WELL THIS RATE IS A SIGN OF SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE PROGRAM FOR IS IT JUST THE PACE OF IMPLEMENTATION. I'VE LOOKED AT IT FROM MANY ANGLES AND MY CONCLUSION IS THAT THE SLOW PACE IS A MATTER OF IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S MANY PLACES AND WAYS TO IMPROVE ON IMPLEMENTATION AT FIRST I WANTED KNOWLEDGE THE DELAYS CAUSED BY CORPORATE. DIRECTOR PARCHMENT. MR WINFIELD YES LEADERSHIP. REGIONAL CENTERS SERVICE COORDINATORS FAMILIES PEOPLE WITH IBD EVERYONE THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. BOB ENSURING GREAT LEADERSHIP TO JUST IT BEING HENCE THIS PROGRAM DESPITE BE INCREDIBLE BARRIERS THE PENAMPANG TO MAKE POST. BIANCO GOOD. IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY WINFIELD MENTIONED STATEWIDE SELF DETERMINATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE PRODUCER BERIA'S RECORDS. ON THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM IDENTIFIED FOUR MAIN BARRIERS I'M GONNA SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE- BARRIERS AND WE'VE PROVIDED THAT REPORTS IN ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TO THIS COMMITTEE. I ALSO THINK THAT THE DDS DATA THAT'S IN THE AGENDA IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT HELPS US. LOOK AT WHERE OUR BREAKDOWNS MAY BE HAPPENING AND COME UP WITH TARGETED REMEDIES NOW WE CAN SEE WHO WAS COMPLETED EACH STEP OF THE PROCESS AND WE CAN SEE IF I REGIONAL CENTER- THE DATA SHOWS THERE'S A DROP OFF BETWEEN STEPS ONE AND STEPS TO. 85% OF PEOPLE COMPLETED THE FIRST STEP BUT ONLY TWENTY EIGHT HAVE FINISHED THE SECOND STEP- SO WE CAN LOOK AT AND THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IN THE PROCESS INCOME OF THE TARGET REMEDIES. FOR EACH STEP OF THE PROCESS SO SOME SOLUTIONS INCLUDE- SETTING BENCHMARKS FOR THE DIFFERENT DATA POINTS THAT ARE THE DEPARTMENTS TRACKING AND REPORTING ON- AS I MENTIONED IS A GOOD ENOUGH THAT 85% OF PEOPLE FINISH THE FIRST STEP- IS IT BAD THAT ONLY TWENTY. 8% OF FINISH THE SECOND STEP AT THIS POINT THE PROCESS OR IS IT JUST A NATURAL PART IN FLOW THIS PROCESS. A BENCH MARKS WILL SET UP REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS. FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE TO GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. ALSO BETTER SOLUTIONS EACH REGIONAL CENTER SHOULD SET A GOAL FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN ENROLL IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. I JUST SAID IT'S PRACTICAL. AN ACCOMPLISHMENT. ANOTHER RECOMMENDED IS THERE'S BE A KEY. TO ENROLL FOR. WHO ARE MY OF LOCAL SELF DETERMINATION ADVISORY COMMITTEES. INTO THE PROGRAM BY JUNE- THEY ARE THEY ARE VERY ENGAGED IN THE PROGRAM THE MOST MOTIVATED. AND THEY SHOULD. THEY SHOULD BE ON. LASSETER'S ONE BURIED IT DOESN'T SHOW UP IN THE DATA OF THE PHASE IN PERIOD ITSELF HAS CREATED ITS OWN BARRIER TO THE PROGRAM- THE SYSTEM EVERYBODY INVOLVED THEIR TIME THEIR THOUGHTS OR SOLUTIONS ARE ALL GOING INTO. MANAGING HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE THREE YEAR PHASE IMPROPER PROCESS- SO IT'S ALREADY LAW THIS PERIOD ENDS ON JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT SHOULD EXPAND STATEWIDE BAN WITHOUT CHANGE ON THAT WITH THE SYSTEM AND SHIFT ITS FOCUS TO OTHER CPAP ASPECTS MAKING THIS PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A- THIS PROJECT HELLO AND I'MSURE THANK YOU SO ANY PARTICULAR YO WE JUST HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM SO- AND REALLY IT'S THAT WE HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS SO THE FIRST IS CONCERNS THE ROLLOUT AND PLAN FOR EXPANDING THE PROGRAM IN JULY AS MR CROWTHER'S JUST NOTED STATUTES ARE REQUIRED A THREE YEAR- PHASE INFURIATED. AFTER THE TIME THAT THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR TO- SECURE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM THAT THREE YEARS ENDS- THIS SUMMER. AND IT'S UNCLEAR AND AT THAT POINT STATUTES SAYS THAT THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ANY CONSUMER WHO IS INTERESTED IN IT- YOU KNOW PROVIDED THEY GO THROUGH THE PROPER INFORMATIONAL SESSIONS AT CETERA. SO WE HAVE SUGGEST SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S REALISTIC- TO THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE READY TO ROLL IT OUT TO ANYBODY STATEWIDE WHO IS INTERESTED IN THE PROGRAM. OUR SECOND CONCERN IS- PRIMARILY FISCAL SO STATUTE REQUIRES THAT THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM- BE BUDGET NEUTRAL. AND THE WAY THAT IT'S WORKING IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL BUDGET FOR EACH- CONSUMER IS BASED ON THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S SPENDING ON THAT CONSUMER AT LEAST TWO CONSIDERATIONS ARE CAN BE ALLOWED HOWEVER SO FOR ONE IF SOMEBODY IS NEW TO THE SYSTEM AND DIDN'T HAVE SPENDING IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR OBVIOUSLY- A NEW BUT IT HAS TO BE DEVELOPED. SECONDLY IF AN INDIVIDUAL HAD- SOME AMOUNT OF UNMET NEED IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM SOME REGIONAL CENTERS AS WELL AS FROM THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF IS THAT CONCERT COMING IN HIGHER- FOR INDIVIDUALS THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. AND THIS COULD REALLY MEAN A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST- IT COULD MEAN THAT CONSUMERS WERE NOT GETTING EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEEDED IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND THIS IS SORT OF MAKING UP FOR THAT IN THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. COULD ALSO MEAN THAT SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL DDS NETWORK BUT- OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL DDS SERVICE PROVIDER NETWORK- COULD YOU COULD COST MORE. AND THAT IN TURN COULD BE A REFLECTION OF THE RATE CHALLENGES- THAT WE'VE ALREADY. HEARD DISCUSSED AT TODAY'S HEARING- WE THAT THE- REQUEST MORE INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL BUDGETING PROCESS IN THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. AND THIS SHOULD INCLUDE DATA ON COSTS AND AUTHORIZED SERVICES- BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER INDIVIDUALS BEGAN THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT FINANCE. BOTH DEPARTMENT FINANCE NOTHING AT. OKAY AND IF IT IS SO WE'VE BEEN TRYIG TO IMPLEMENT THIS FOR THREE YEARS AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE BUT IT IS IT IS IT A VALUABLE SERVICE THAT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN OF AND I'M ASSUMING STEP ONE IS THE ORIENTATION AND THE GETTING INTO THE STEP TWO IS CHOOSING SERVICES AND IMPLEMENTING THOSE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. BUT IF PEOPLE ARE DOING STEP ONE OF THE NOT GOING INTO STEP TWO IS IT. RIGHT I MEAN IF PEOPLE DON'T GO TO A RESTAURANT AFTER WELL WEEK WE DON'T JUST KEEP WILL BE KEEPING IT OPEN WE CLOSE THE RESTAURANT BESIDE US THAT WILL PEOPLE ONE EIGHT. YEAH I'M SURE THIS IS NANCY PARCHMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT- DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOP ALL SERVICES IF I MAY- RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION- THEIR SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM IS. A PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN- DESIRED BY OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR FAMILIES- IT IS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF A PROGRAM IN THE SENSE. THAT IT PROVIDES CHOICE AND FLEXIBILITY- AND RESPONSIBILITY ON BEHALF OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS CHOOSING TO PARTICIPATE IN SELF DETERMINATION VERSUS TRADITIONAL RETAIL CENTER SERVICES. AND WE HAVE FOUND OVER YEAR OVER THE YEARS- WHEN WE HAVE INTRODUCED NEW PROGRAMS IN OUR SYSTEM. THAT THERE HAS BEEN. TIMES WHERE IT'S TAKEN EIGHT EIGHT NUMBER OF YEARS UNFORTUNATELY BUT A NUMBER OF YEARS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THE STRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO- BUILDS THE POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION AND CERTAINLY WE HAVE FOUND CHALLENGES WITHIN THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM- BUT IT IS DEFINITELY A PROGRAM THAT IS. DESIRED BY OUR COMMUNITY AND ONE THAT WE AS A DEPARTMENT REMAIN COMMITTED. AND IDENTIFYING THE BARRIERS AND- BUT ALSO ADDRESSING AS MISS PADDICK HAD HAD NOTED LOOKING AT THE- THE- THE COST- PRIOR TO SOMEBODY WHO IS PARTICIPATING AFTER SOMEBODY'S WHO WHO WHO IS ENGAGED IN SELF DETERMINATION. AND THE DRIVERS THAT ARE IMPACTING KIND OF THOSE FISCAL- ELEMENTS ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO GET FOR THEIR VISIBILITY INTO IT- WE ARE WORKING WE HAVE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM CMS- TO ASSIST US IN REVIEWING OUR CURRENT. PROGRAM AND- WE ARE LOOKING AT DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR GOING FORWARD- THAT- WE- ANTICIPATE AND WILL HAVE AVAILABLE THIS SPRING- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT I HOPE HOPE THAT HELPS- PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CLARITY REGARDING THE PROGRAM AND- KIND OF SOME OF THE- AND OF HIGH LEVEL STRUGGLES AND IMPLEMENTATION. N. M. AND A AND I'VE HEARD GOOD JUST REPEATEDLY THROUGH THIS HEARING. YOU KNOW WE THINK ANECDOTALLY HOW MUCH GOOD DATA ARE WE COLLECTING ON OUR AGAIN IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BENCHMARKS FOR TALK ABOUT. OUTCOMES WERE TALK ABOUT BARRIERS. WHAT KIND BOOKS OF DATA TOOLS ARE WE USE TAX GET RELEVANT V&lt;c.cyan&gt; RELATIVITY. AND&lt;/c&gt; THEN AND THEN RIP IT DOWN THEN USING IT. YES THANK YOU- ON FIRST OF TO TERMINATION- AS MR WINFIELD HAD HAD NOTED- AND SAME WITH- L. A. O. AND MR CROWTHER'S. IS THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOW WITH THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A SPENDING PLAN- THAT IS- BY DEFINITION FOR US ARE THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ACTUALLY HAVING EXPENDITURES THEY'RE SPENDING THEIR THEIR THEIR BUDGET- AND SO IN IN OUR- IN OUR SYSTEM- WE HAD TWO THINGS THAT- WE- WE CAN ACCESS FOR MEASURE- ONE IS- WHAT IS THE UTILIZATION. OF EXPENDITURES SO- I AM- RECEIVING SERVICES- FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER AND- RESPITE AND YOU KNOW DAY SERVICES AND MY TOTAL EXPENDITURES ARE. ACTS HOWEVER I HAD AUTHORIZED THE AUTHORIZED SERVICES OF Y. SO I MAY HAVE HAD MORE AUTHORS- SERVICES AUTHORIZED THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SPEND- AND THERE'S VARIOUS REASONS FOR THAT- AND THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE'RE COMPARING- BEFORE THEIR SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM DOES- SERVICES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED. DOES IT HAVE BEEN EXPENDED BEFORE AND THEN THOSE- INDIVIDUAL BUDGETS THAT FAMILIES- HAVE YET UNDER SELF DETERMINATION AND THEN. IT'S SO EARLY ON RIGHT. NOW THAT WHILE WE'VE NO. HOW MUCH IS OFF BY STILL DETERMINING WE HOW MUCH IS EXPENDED BEFORE SELF DETERMINATION AND FOR THOSE FOUR HUNDRED AND SOME INDIVIDUALS WE KNOW WHAT THEIR BUDGETS ARE- FOR THEIR SPENDING PLAN WHAT WE DON'T HAVE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME IN THE PROGRAM IS HOW MUCH THEY'RE SPENDING. OF THOSE EXPENDITURES- SO- WE DO HAVE IN IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND WHILE WE HAVE MANY CHALLENGES IN OUR DATA- THIS IS IN ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT THAT WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE OR TIME IN THE PROGRAM- THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO GIVE US THAT THAT. THAT KIND OF ASSESSMENT AT THIS TIME BUT WE ARE ARE TRACKING TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT. MADAM CHAIR AND COURTESY STATE COUNCIL IF I CAN ADD AN AMPLIFIED DIRECTOR BURDENS COMMENTS. YES THIS PROGRAM IS VERY MUCH IN DEMAND WANTED BY THE COMMUNITY THE FIRST MEASURE ACTUALLY SPEAKS TO THAT- IT IS AFTER YOU'VE HAD YOUR ORIENTATION DO YOU STILL WANT TO GO ON AND CONTINUE IN THE PROGRAM. 85% SAID YES TO SPEAKING DIRECTLYTO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT DEMAND AND ALSO- DECREE WITH DRUG DEPARTMENT'S COMMENT THAT. WITH 20% OF THE PEOPLE THROUGH THE PROGRAM IT'S NOT QUITE A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE AS TO WHAT THE EXPENDITURES WILL BE WHETHER. WHETHER NOT THE L. A. O. CONCERNS. WITH CAN BE SUPPORTED BY INFORMATION. I THINK. THAT CAN. THANKS VERY MUCH. THIS IS THE LOOKING THROUGH. SOME OF THE INFORMATION PRESENTED TOOK THE FIRST OF ALL- IF SOMEONE IS GOING THROUGH SELF DETERMINATION- AT WHAT POINT IT ARE SIMPLE OF THE FORTY FORTY SEVEN PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE A PLANET HAVE EXPENDTURE IF THEY DECIDED THIS ISN'T WORKING FOR THEM CAN THEY GET BACK OUT AGAIN. YES FROM REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS CAN OPT OUT OF SELF DETERMINATION IF THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO TRADITIONAL SIX AT ANYTIME. ANYTIME OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY THAT THAT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT IT IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE BUDGET THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO BUDGET. IT IS THAT IS BASED ON- THE PREVIOUS I GUESS THE PREVIOUS YEAR BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO ENTER INTO SELF DETERMINATION. IS A- NOW- WELL CERTAINLY SOME DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES MAY BE FAIRLY STABLE OVER TIME CERTAINLY CIRCUMSTANCES MAY CHANGE AND SOMETIMES SOME OF THE DEVELOP DISABILITIES MAY NOT BE SO STABLE DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE DISABILITY IS. ARE THERE JUST THEIR INTENTION THAT THEIR ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE FOR THOSE THINGS OVER TIME OR I KNOW THIS IS WE'RE STILL KIND OF NEW OURS OURS AFFECTS BUDGET FOR I MEAN HOW FIX IS THIS BUDGET OVER TIME. AND HOW DOES IT TAKE ACCOUNT OF CHANGING. CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. YEAH SO THIS DETERMINE PRO. IS SIMILAR TO TRADITIONAL. MANAGEMENT AND THAT- THE PLANNING TEAM COMES UP WITH A PLAN. DENNIS THAT PLANNED AT THE TOWN BUDGET IS DETERMINED AND INDEED- IS DERIVED FROM THE BUDGET. SO THE MONEY TEAM LOOKS AT PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS OF EXPENDITURES AND THEN THEY CONSIDER ANY UNMET NEEDS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL MIGHT HAVE. AND THEN THAT HELPS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS IN THE I. P. AND ASK THE BUDGET AND SPIN OKAY SO I WAS IN THE SELF DETERMINATION PLANNED AHEAD OF BUDGET FOR ONE YEAR. AND THEN THEY MADE CERTAIN CHOICES. PLANNING TEAM WILL LOOK AT THAT AND THEN DECIDE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET ARDELL. LOOK AT A HYPOTHETICAL SET OF- THAT THAT FOR. OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY SELF DETERMINATION PER THAT ARE DID NOT DECIDE TO PURCHASE. IT SO I'M JUST WONDERING LIKE HOW. WHAT DOES THE TEAM LOOK AT IF SOMEONE'S ACTUALLY IN THE SELF DETERMINATION- PROGRAM- ARE THEY ACTUALLY LOOKING AT WHAT THEY ACTUALLY CHOSE TO SPEND UNDER BUDGET ARE THEY LOOKING AT A HYPOTHETICAL PLANNED FOR SOMEONE OF THIS AND SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S BASED ON THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR NEEDS AND THOSE NEEDS CAN BE REVISITED AND ANYTIME. OKAY OUT SENT OUT OF THE PLANNING TEAM COULD MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE BUDGET BASED ON. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY ALL RIGHT- AND THEN- I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT- SO I GUESS. IS IT- WILL COMING SOON WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRANCH THIS OUT TO EVERYONE. BUT AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS MADE THAT IT SEEMS TO BE POPULAR BECAUSE 85% PEOPLE OF TO GET ORIENTED SHOWS TOO BUT SAME TIME- IT MAKE NOTE THAT WE- WE HAVEN'T HIT THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. RIGHT LET ME WITH A TWENTY FIVE WE'VE HAD SPACES WE'VE HAD THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED. TWENTY SIX PEOPLE SELECTED BUT THEN A HUNDRED SEVEN. YEAH ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO THE TRUE SO WORD THAT CONTINUE PARTICIPATION ONLY TWENTY ONE FIFTY FOUR. OF WHICH ONLY FOUR TO FORTY SEVEN ARE CONTINUING SELF. NOT SAYING THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT THIS BUT- IS THERE A THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS WERE I MEAN WE HAVEN'T REALLY UNVEILED A PHILIP THE PILOT IN SOME WAYS THAT INITIAL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SO. IS THE PLAN TO STILL THE CONTINUE THE PILOT TO GET MORE DATA OR TO I MEAN WE'RE AT THAT WE'RE GOING WE'RE RUNNING UP AGAINST A POINT WHERE SINGLE NOW WHAT'S GOING TO OPEN UP TO EVERYONE BUT DO WE REALLY KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THIS. SINCE WE CAN'T EVEN GET THE PILOT TO BE COMPLETELY. FILLED. AND DOCTOR CANADA. NANCY BIRDS MENDES. YEAH THERE IS A COUPLE THINGS I'D LIKE TO MAKE NOTE OF IT IS THAT WE ARE- EVALUATING- WHAT ARE KIND OF PLANNED FOR ROLLOUT LIKE. LIKE I HAD HAD HAD SAID THAT WE FIND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO. HAVE A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE- KIND OF PLANET APPROACH TO NEXT STEPS TO ADDRESS- THE BARRIERS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BUT THEN ALSO TO. IDENTIFY YOU KNOW HOW TO WHAT THE DIGITAL GUARDRAILS IF ANY ARE NEEDED- SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH YOU KNOW HOW ARE WE APPROACHING THERE'S% THAT I USE. AND SELF DETERMINATION THE ONLY VENDOR TO SERVICE IN SELF DETERMINATION IS THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SERVICE- AND AS WE LOOK AT- SOME OF THE BARRIERS SOME OF IT IS CENTERED AROUND. AND HOW WE'VE APPROACHED OUR OUR OUR STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES SO. WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THAT FORWARD- SO TO YOUR POINT AS FAR AS- ARE WE GOING TO USE MORE INFORMATION TO HELP INFORM US AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO IT YOU KNOW AS NOTED WE HAD. MORE THAN DOUBLED- THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS THAT HAVE MOVED PAST ORIENTATION. PASSED HAVING THEIR BUDGET THAT TOO THERE'S MANY PLANT. WE HAVE MORE INDIVIDUALS OF THAT MILESTONE AT THE LATER STAGES THAT WE DID EARLIER ON- I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT NATIONALLY- THERE'S- MOST STATE WHO HOW ASSAULTED. PROGRAM AND WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THAT- AVERAGE ABOUT THEIR WAIVERS ACTUALLY OPTED TO PARTICIPATE IN A SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM- AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S A CAP THAT WE WOULD WANT TO ACHIEVE TO- BUT I THINK IT GIVES US A LITTLE BIT OF VISIBILITY INTO. WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE EXPERIENCED- WHEN THEY'VE HAD THE BROADER- DOOR OPEN FOR A MORE PARTICIPANTS BEYOND WHAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE PILOT OF OR NOT I SHOULDN'T USE THE TERM PILOT. OF THE FADED OF THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED VERSES- HAVING IT OPEN TO OUR BROADER COMMUNITY. OKAY SO I GUESS WHAT I'M NOT HEARING IS- THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHICH IS THAT DO YOU PLAN TO CAN T. D. IT WELL I GUESS YOU'LL TELL. OF THE BY MAIL BE TELLING BECAUSE THERE'S- A STATUTORY DEADLINE RIGHT THIS TALK ABOUT OPENING IT UP OR NOT. YEAH- ARE YOU PLAN TO CONTINUE TO PILE WHICH BY THE WAY STILL HAS SLOTS SO IT'S NOT THAT WOULD DENY ANYONE WHO WANTS TO DO IT. ARE WE SAYING THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW ENOUGH TO COMPLETELY OPEN IT UP AND THEN ALSO. SINCE YOU MENTIONED 10215% AND I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER. WHAT SO WE HAVE A PILE OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED WHICH WE HAVE A FILLED OUT THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY AT 10% OR FIFTEEN PERCENT. HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD THAT BE GIVEN WHO YOU'RE SERVING NOW- AND DDS SO I MEAN. TWENTY FIVE AND REPRESENTS WHAT PERSONNEL WHAT PERCENTAGE. YEAH I DID- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I YOU KNOW I AM WELL I'M NOT. AND IT IS CAN YOU JUST SAY OF THAT THAT'S CORRECT OUR PLAN WE DO PLAN ON ON ON. HAVING AN OUTLINE OF KIND OF THOSE STEPS GOING FORWARD- YOU KNOW AND I DO WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE I'D MISUSED THE WORD PILOT THIS IS NOT A PILOT- AND- SO. YOU KNOW IT IS OUR INTENT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM OPEN- TO OUR BROADER COMMUNITY- WE HAVE SOME THINGS TO WORK THROUGH. AND BEFORE I CAN SAY THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ON TRACK TO HAVE A VERY BROAD OPENING. AND WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH HOW DO WE DO THAT HOW DO THE REGIONAL CENTERS BE ABLE TO. HELP INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW MOVED TO SELF DETERMINATION HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT SOME OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE NEED TO- I WHAT I CALL KIND OF STRUCTURE- IN THE PROGRAM NOW. YOU'LL HEAR FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS- THAT THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS PROGRAMS NOT JUST SAYING OKAY WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND OPEN. YOU KNOW AS OF JUNE OR JULY AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT E'RE ADDRESSING THE BARRIERS AND ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO HAVE KIND OF COURSE CORRECTION IN THE PROGRAM. YOU REALLY HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM GOING FORWARD- WE WANT THAT WE WANT IT TO BE SUCCESSFUL THIS IS WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS A SATHYAM FOR THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CHOICE- SO- AS FAR AS THOSE NEXT STEPS YOU KNOW WE'RE WE HAVE TO ALSO WORK THROUGH OUR WAIVER- AND- SO ANY CHANGES OR ANYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING IT'S GOING TO BE. VERY VERY TRANSPARENT AND WORKING WITH OUR FAMILIES THAT ARE- VERY DEDICATED AND ADVOCATING FOR SELF DETERMINATION- SO I JUST I ASKED YOU KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW MORE TO COME OVER THE SPRING WHEN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TEAMS TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT MODIFICATIONS- WOULD- BENEFIT THE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD ON ARTS. SO I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS THERE STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO. CERTAINLY I AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING WE RECENTLY STOPPED DOING THIS- BUT ALSO BASED EVEN ON YOUR OWN DATA. AND EVEN THOUGH YOUR OWN TESTIMONY RIGHT NOW THAT THEY'RE STILL A LOT OF. THAT WORK OUT. SO AT LEAST. IT THOUGH YOU'RE NOT SAYING THIS RIGHT NOW I THINK CERTAINLY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN- IN MY WORK WITH YOU. THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE OF AN UPDATE AND A WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE LEASE AND YOU KNOW FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR. IN TERMS OF HOW TO MOVING THIS PROGRAM FORWARD AND BE SURE THAT THOSE GUARD RAILS ARE ARE THERE SO. IT'S YOU KNOW CERTAINLY NOT OPPOSED TO DOING SELF DETERMINATION I THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS THAT- SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE GUARDRAILS YET GIVEN THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION WE HAVE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE STILL. DON'T HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE PILOT ARE YOU DON'T CALL PILOT BUT BASICALLY AND- IS OUR FIRST COHORT RIGHT WE DON'T EVEN FILL THE NUMBERS UP OKAY- FOR THAT AND SO I THINK WE WANT TO BE SURE WE HAVE THOSE. ENOUGH DATA TO SO THAT WE HAVE THOSE LESSONS LEARNED AND I THINK CERTAINLY. HERE THOSE OF US HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO BE SURE WERE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION SO AND THAT WE WANT AND WOOD IT'S SNOWING I ROLLED OVERSIGHT TO BE ABLE. TO KNOW WHAT WHAT. WHAT THE PLANS ARE AND. WHAT KIND OF GUARDRAILS ARE BEING PUT IN PLACE. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WILL MAKE NOTE THAT- WE ARE. AND SHORT TERM LOOKING AT HOW DO WE- PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE- TO MOVE. YOU KNOW THROUGH THEIR THAT. TO YOU KNOW INCREASE R. FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIXTY. INDIVIDUALS QUICKER AND THERE ARE SOME SHORT TERM- THINGS THAT WE CAN DO- TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT ON A SHORT TERM BASIS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT SHORTEN A LONGER TERM. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND- OUR COMMUNITY ON THE SOUTHERN ONE OTHER PIECE OF EVERY SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING. THE LOVE THE AMOUNT OF OVERHEAD IN TERMS OF- FOR THE DEPARTMENT FOR PEOPLE AND SELF DETERMINATION VERSES IF THEY'RE GETTING REGULAR SO HOW MUCH. OVERHEAD DISASSOCIATED- I WAS THE WE WANT TO PROVIDE FAMILIES WHO AREN'T SELF DETERMINATION SOME SUPPORT SO AND I JUST LIKE HERE YOU GO THE- FIGURE OUT YOURSELF AND WE WILL HAVE SO IN TERMS OF OVERHEAD I'M NOT. SAYING IT'S ALL BAD- BUT- I JUST WANNA KNOW WHAT THE OVERHEAD ALSO IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT DOING THIS UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR PANDERING PRODUCING STATE COUNCIL- THE RATES FOR QUESTIONS REGARDING THE AMOUNT THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED- WHAT I'M SEEING FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IS THAT EVERY PART OF THE SYSTEM IS WORKING TOGETHER TO STILL IMPLEMENTED WORKS OF THESE ISSUES SO WELL THERE'S A LOT TO WORK ON I WOULDN'T TAKE THAT AS A INDICATION OR SIGN OF PROBLEMS OF THE PROGRAM- BY REGIONAL CENTERS FAMILIES CONSUMERS I'M CERTAINLY THAT DIRECT THE DEPARTMENTS AT LEADERSHIP IS WORKING ON AN EVIDENCE OF THAT IS HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ROLLED EVEN DURING CO BUT- WITH ALL OF THE DEMANDS AND- JUST. LIFESAVING OUR- OF THE PANDEMIC FROM THOSE LAST YEAR IT IF PEOPLE WEREN'T COMMITTED THIS PROGRAM USING JUST A SORT OF WALK AWAY AND NOT MAKE MOVEMENT ON IT BUT THERE. HAS BEEN MOVEMENT DESPITE ALL ODDS AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD EVIDENCE TO THE DEDICATION TO THIS PROGRAM. I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK IT'S- IS AGAIN I'M NOT OPPOSED TO ACTUALLY I THINK THAT IT'S GOOD DIRECTION IF THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT- BUT ALSO. IN OUR OVERSIGHT FUNCTION WE WANT TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT TO EAT. IS WERE ROLLING OUT THAT WE'RE DOING IT NOW. IT DIDN'T IN A MANNER ACTUALLY THAT THE DIRECTOR JUST TALKED ABOUT AND THAT WE- HAVE CLARITY FOR OURSELVES HERE IN THE LEGISLATION OVERSIGHT FUNCTION WHAT- WHAT LESSONS LEARNED WHAT KIND OF GUARDRAILS ARE. YOU OVERSIGHT EXPENSES YOU KNOW THE SUPPORTS FAMILIES NEED WHEN THEY'RE DOING. STUFF THE TERMINATION THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I. AND I THINK WE'RE KIND OF ALL SAYING THE SAME THING WE CAN WE CAN FEEL LIKE THIS IS A GOOD IDEA BUT- IF IT'S BEEN UP AND RUNNING AND IT'S NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET. TO GO BACK TO THE EARLIER ANALOGY BEFORE WE FRANCHISES OUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY. IN THE WHO IS WHO IS IN THIS NOT PILOT BUT THIS. FIRST A FIRST WAVE WILL SAY- AN EFFECTIVE MANNER BEFORE WE SAY WE'RE TAKING THIS. WE'RE EXPANDING THIS EVEN FURTHER. OKAY I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON TO NOW ISSUE NUMBER FIVE COMMUNITY NAVIGATORS. THANK YOU MEDICARE- NANCY PARCHMENT DIRECTOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES- I. E. FOR THE BEST- ISSUE FIVE- I WILL BE ADDRESSING- QUESTIONS ONE AND TWO- AND THEN THIS IS YOUR BIG- WILL- PROVIDE RESPONSES FOR QUESTIONS THREE AND FOUR- I HATE IT THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTNITY TO- PRESENT TO YOU OUR PROPOSAL FOR THE COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR PROGRAM- THIS IS. REALLY STEM FROM ALONG THE- QUITE ACTUALLY SINCE I STARTED THE DEPARTMENT- AS DIRECTOR BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT- THE PRIORITY OF ADDRESSING THE INEQUITY OF SPENDING AND DISPARITIES WITHIN OUR PROGRAMS- ONE IS THAT THE NUMBER OF- POLICIES AND EFFORTS- THAT WE HAVE IN AND WORKING- ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT- CHALLENGES. I'M FACING- SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND- NEED TO CONTINUE TO KEEP- THE EFFORTS. OF AS A PRIORITY BUT ALSO LOOKING AT NEW WAYS TO BE ABLE TO- BE RESPONSIVE AND DISRUPT YES- INEQUITY OF SERVICE DELIVERY AND IN PARTICULAR AREAS. SO PART OF OUR EFFORT- THE GRANT PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN OPERATION SINCE- SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. AND OVER THE YEARS- THAT FOR THOSE- FOR NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THAT WE DO HAVE ELEVEN MILLION. DOLLARS THAT- HAD HAS BEEN APPROVED IN OUR BUDGET FOR THAT IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT COULD GO TO A GRANT PROGRAM AND- THE FIRST YEAR WE IMPLEMENTED IT WE HAD IMPLEMENTED IT ON TO REGIONAL CENTRES- AS KIND OF THE SOLE SOURCE OF IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT WERE RELATED TO THEIR COMMUNITIES.% THE SECOND YEAR- REALLY THROUGH THE WISDOM OF- SOME FAMILIES WHO IS THAT HEY WAIT YOU KNOW COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE REALLY THE ONES THAT HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR COMMUNITY AND IF WE HAVE KIND OF CONCERNS AND- FEARS OF THE REGIONAL CENTER- SOME OF IT IS- KIND OF THAT QUALIFY A GOVERNMENT AGENCY SOME OF IT IS- BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN BROKEN THERE IS- JUST A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED. AND THAT WAS VERY WISE SO THANK YOU YEAR WE IMPLEMENTED USING BE COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS- OVER THE YEARS THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF. MODELS BASED ON NAVIGATOR. OR FROM A TORAH. AND I WE'RE IN A ROW FORTY SOME DIFFERENT PROJECTS- THAT HAS- A BALLS YOU KNOW INTO VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE- WITH FOCUS AND VARIOUS DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES- NINE OF THOSE PROJECTS WERE WITH FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS- ONE OF MY ARE CHALLENGES THEM AND WE HAVE THAT WE'VE TALKED TO. THIS COMMITTEE- IN PAST YEARS IS ABOUT HOW DO WE MEASURE- SUCCESS OF THESE PROJECTS YOU KNOW AND HAVING A CONSISTENT WAY TO BE ABLE TO DO. KIND OF A PRE AND A POST AND WHAT ARE WHAT ARE THE NOT ONLY THE QUANTITATIVE BUT THE QUALITATIVE. OUTCOMES AND SO IN LOOKING AT- KNOWING THAT EVIDENCE BASED FROM A TORAH AND LOOKING AT THE RESPONSE THAT WE'VE BEEN GETTING ON OUR NAVIGATOR PROGRAMS- WE WANTED TO BUILD ON THAT. AND ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ONE WAY TO MEASURE SUCCESS OF A STRATEGY OR INITIATIVE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. AND THAT THE INEQUITY OR SERVICE ACCESS IF YOU WILL- SO THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU- THE GENDER CORRECTLY NOTES THAT IT'S- WE HAVE PROPOSED FIVE POINT THREE MILLION TOTAL FUND THREE POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND- THAT WOULD CONTRACT WITH FAMILY RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR ESSENTIALLY TWENTY ONE DIFFERENT CONTRACTS- AND BASED ON STAKEHOLDER INPUT THAT WE PLAN ON ON GAINING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS- IF THERE NEEDS TO BE A FEW MORE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ASSURANCES TO A BROADER COMMUNITY ACCESS WE CERTAINLY WOULD ENTERTAIN THAT- BUT WHEN WE- ARE LOOKING AT THIS. THE FIRST YEAR WE WANT TO ALSO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT. REVIEW OF OUR GRANT PROGRAM. I THE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE- ALREADY FUNDED AND HOW BEEN IN IN. EVALUATION LATE LET US KNOW WHAT ARE THE CURRENT EFFORTS AND- AND IS IT REALLY PROMOTING- AND REDUCING- DISPARITIES AND- INCREASING ACCESS TO SERVICES AND THEN WHAT WOULD BE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THAT- PROGRAM. SO FOR THE FIRST YEAR WELL WE HAVE- FIVE HUNDRED- THOUSAND EARMARKED FOR THIS CONTRACT TO AN INDEPENDENT PARTY- WE DO- WANT TO BE FLEXIBLE AND LOOKING AT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A VERY MEANINGFUL AND REVIEW THAT IS GOING TO BE INFORMATIVE. TO US AND ALSO INFORMATIVE TO OUR COMMUNITY IN THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL- SO THAT THIS PROPOSAL AS THEY NOTED- DOES- PROPOSED THE TWENTY ONE DIFFERENCE- FRC'S- WE WOULD DO THIS THROUGH A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL WE WOULD WORK- THROUGH- THAT THE COMMUNITY TO PROPOSE THAT AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS PROPOSED. YES WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER AND KIND OF A COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR HOW IS IT GOING TO BE DIFFERENT- AS A PROBABLY NOTED AND THE AGENDA AT THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS ARE REALLY ENGAGED IN EARLY START WELL SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH REGIONAL CENTERS TO DO SOME OTHER EFFORTS THEIR PRIMARY FOCUS REALLY HAS BEEN. ON CONNECTING TO THE COMMUNITIES- IN AN EARLY START AND HELP BEING KIND OF- PARENT EDUCATION- THIS REALLY BROADENS THAT SO WHAT WE WOULD BE ASKING IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE DIFFERENCE WHERE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS CAN EXPAND. THEIR EFFORTS AND WOULD BE ABLE. TO HIRE ONE OR MORE- NAVIGATE THAT ARE TRUSTED THE CAN. SO IT WOULD BE DRIVEN BASED ON EITHER A FAMILY MEMBER OR SOMEBODY THAT IS- SEPARATE FROM A REGIONAL CENTER- TO BE ABLE TO HELP FAMILIES- CONNECT AND UNDERSTAND REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. ALSO GENERIC RESOURCES AND OF BUILDING THAT BRIDGE BUT ALSO BUILDING B. INDIVIDUALS AND THE FAMILIES- SKILL SETS TO BE ABLE TO AT- ADVOCATE AND NAVIGATE- EVEN BEYOND THE WORK THAT- THAT COMMUNITY NAVIGATORS WOULD BE ABLE TO DO WITH THEM- WE WOULD- BUILD N A- MEASURE THAT WOULD BE PRE AND POST. SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A STANDARDIZED MEASURE ACROSS THE STATE YOU'VE HEARD ON A COUPLE OF THE OTHER PANEL SOME OF THE CHALLENGES- OF SOME INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE HAD GOING FORWARD- THAT THE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN RACIAL CENTERS AND SO AGAIN THIS IS REALLY ABOUT. THE DEPARTMENT THEN ISSUING AT PROVIDING KIND OF THE STRUCTURE AROUND IT SO WE WOULD HAVE CONSISTENCY IN THE GOALS AND THE TRAINING AND EXPECTATIONS THAT WOULD BE ACROSS. EACH OF THOSE AND THEN THE SAME FOR THE MEASURES THAT WE WOULD. BE PUTTING FORWARD- AND WE CAME UP WITH THE PROPOSED AMOUNT- WE LOOK TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO HAVE A COUPLE OF POSITIONS- THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK WITHIN THE DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AS WELL ASTHE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORTS THAT WOULD GO IN. AND SO ON AN AVERAGE IS ABOUT- ON A ON GOING BASIS IT WOULD BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PER. AND REGIONAL CENTER BUT AGAIN BASED ON STAKEHOLDER INPUT WE ARE GOING TO- EVLUATE HOW IT WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT SMALLERREGIONAL CENTERS HAVE. ALMOST IS AS MANY CHALLENGES AS LARGER REGIONAL CENTER CATCHMENT AREAS- SO WE DON'T WANT TO JUST DO A STANDARD HEY IF YOU HAVE. FOUR THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN YOUR COMMUNITY VERSUS FOURTEEN THOUSAND- WE DON'T WANT TO MEASURE IT BASED ON THAT WE WANT TO MEASURE TO BASED ON BASED ON HOW WE CAN HAVE AFFECTED- NEEDS MET- ON THIS PROGRAM. SO MR TREVINO WILL GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE UPDATES BASED ON YOUR QUESTIONS THREE AND FOUR THANK YOU. SURE ENOUGH. I THANK YOU MISTER- TO AGAIN OF THE- THANKS THE UP. I'M GONNA PICK IT UP PAGE OF THE AGENDA TALKING ABOUT. ARE APPROACH. AS DOOR MARK JUST- EACH REGIONAL CENTER NOW HAS A CULTURE SPACE. DEREK TO CULTURAL LINGUISTIC COMPETENCY. WE HAVE ONE AT THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AND ALSO HAVE A RELATIVELY NEW ASSISTANT DEPUTY FOR SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY. HER NAME IS LAYING ON A WALSER- THE ANNUAL BUDGET INCLUDES ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR GRANTS TO REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE BUDGET- A YEAR AGO A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WERE ALSO ADDED AS- ALLOWED RECIPIENTS. OF THAT FUNDING- AND THESE GRANTS SUPPORT REGIONAL CENTER PLANS. TO PROMOTE EQUITY. ANNUALLY THE REGIONAL SIDE KALEB WITH THE- TOGETHER AND REPORT DATA RELATED TO PURCHASE SERVICE AUTHORIZATION UTILIZATION AND EXPENDITURES. THEY ALSO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES TO IDENTIFY A SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES. BARRIERS TO EQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLANS TO REDUCE IDENTIFIED DISPARITIES- ANNUALLY THOSE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT ON EQUITY MEASURES AS PART OF THEIR ANNUAL PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS THEY HAVE TO REVIEWS- SATISFACTION SURVEY DATA WITH THEIR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS. NEWS REGIONAL CENTERS OF NONPROFITS WITH BOARDS I ACTUALLY HAVE TO REVIEW ACTIONS TAKEN TO IMPROVE PUBLIC ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION AT STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. ALL THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE COPIES OF MINUTES AN ATTENDEE COMMENTS AND ALSO THEIR OWN RECOMMENDATIONS ON A PLAN FOR PROMOTING EQUITY PROMOTING EQUITY AND REDUCING DISPARITIES. I DO THEM IN SCOPE IN NINETEEN DURING CALENDAR TWENTY TWENTY THE TIME FRAMES FOR. THESE MEETINGS AND THE REPORTS WERE EXTENDED AND THEIR ANNUAL REPORTS WERE DUE ONLY RECENTLY- WE'VE I DO WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS- AND THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE AND THE SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY WORKGROUP- AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER MEETINGS TO IDENTIFY SOME PRIORITY AREAS OF FOCUS. FOR THE SPRINT PROGRAM. ONE YEAH THERE'S THREE OF THEM- BUILT BUILDING THE LEADERSHIP CAPACITY OF SELF ADVOCATES AND FAMILIES TO INCREASE THEIR REPRESENTATION INVOICE AND THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM. SECONDED CREATING COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONNECTION OF LEARNING BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THIRD IMPROVING ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY- INCLUDING TRAINING FOR SELF ADVOCATES AND FAMILIES. SO WITH THOSE PRIORITIES IN MIND THE DEPARTMENT AS ANNUALLY FUNDED PROJECTS THESE PROJECTS FALL INTO SEVERAL DIFFERENT CATEGORIES INCLUDING TRANSLATIONS CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC COMPETENCY TRAINING. PERSON CENTERED PLANNING TRAINING AARON NAVIGATORS AND PARENTS SUPPORT SERVICES INCLUDING PROMISE FOR A PROGRAMS FOR ACCESSING SERVICES AND REGIONAL CENTERS AND THROUGH OTHER SYSTEMS. SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN SIXTEEN I'M SORRY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT FIRST YEAR WE FUNDED OVER A HUNDRED PROJECTS AND WE GRADUALLY BROUGHT THAT DOWN ANNUALLY OVER TIME. FOR REASONS I'LL MENTION A SECOND WE DID SIXTY FIVE PROJECTS IN THE SECOND YEAR SIXTY FOUR IN THE THIRD FIFTY FIVE PROJECTS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND WE'RE CURRENTLY FINALIZING SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OF WORDS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR BUT THE DETAILS OF ALL OF THESE PROJECTS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS AVAILABLE IN THE EQUITY SECTION OF OUR WEBSITE. I'D LIKE TO MAKE A QUICK DIGRESSION HERE BECAUSE I DID MENTION OUR WEB WEBSITE. DR TAN HAVE. INCREASED FOREST EARLIER AND SAID IT WAS CREDIT TO OUR TEAM. WHO'S MONITORING THE HEARING REMOTELY AND SUPPORTING US TODAY IN THE LAST THIRTY DAYS WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND VISITORS TO OUR WEBSITE. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE SIXTH OF OUR POPULATION ALTHOUGH NON NONCONFORMIST. ACCESS AS WELL OF COURSE. IN A RECENT SURVEY. THAT WE DID IT. OUR CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES ARE SELF ADVOCATES AND FAMILIES. 89% OF THEM INDICATED THAT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET HAS BEEN A CRITICAL TOOL FOR THEM IN THE PAST YEAR. AND THAT THAT SAME PERCENTAGE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM OUR DEPARTMENT VIA EMAIL AS WELL- SO YOU KNOW WHILE IT'S OF COURSE NOT THE ONLY THING THAT WE DO. WE ARE HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE POSTING HOUSE VALUE. AND IS BEING SHARED BY PEOPLE THE ON OUR OWN EFFORTS TO DISSEMINATE IT- BEEN BACK TO THE- JUST DISPARITY GRANTS PROGRAM THEY'RE THEY'RE OVER THESE LAST FOUR FOUR YEARS WE HAVE. LEARNED A FEW LESSONS AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO LEARN THEM. WELL FIRST OF FINING CONCRETE OUTCOMES IS REALLY DIFFICULT. MEETING WITH FAMILIES AND THEN COUNTING THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE THINGS ARE EASIER CAL. HOWEVER THEY'RE REALLY DIFFICULT TO CONNECT WITH MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS AND ACT IN ACCESS DESPITE THE INTUITIVE CONNECTION THAT BEING ABLE TO READ SOMETHING IN YOUR OWN LANGUAGE MIGHT MEAN FOR YOUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO MEASURE. HOW YOUR ACCESS HAS BEEN IMPROVED- PURCHASE OF SERVICE IS AN IMPORTANT METRIC- AND IT'S ONE THAT WE- CONTINUED OUR TO REQUIRE REGIONAL CENTERS TO REPORT ON- BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THAT THE AGE THE PLACE OF RESIDENCE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES THE DISTANCE THAT PEOPLE. EITHER NEED TO BE TRANSPORTED- OR THAT THE SERVICE PROVIDER MUST COVER TO GET TO. I AM PEOPLE'S INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ALSO AFFECT OF PURCHASE OF SERVICE SPENDING. WELL OF COURSE WILL CONTINUE AT A POPULATION LEVEL TO COMPARE THOSE THINGS- WERE ALSO TRYING TO DIVE DEEPER INTO OUR DATA TO LOOK AT SIMILARLY SITUATED INDIVIDUALS. TO DRAW MORE FINER COMPARISON- LIGHTLY LIKE IF YOU WILL. BUT WE'VE ALSO LEARNED AND IT PROBABLY IS OBVIOUS YOUR IF WE HAVE A POT OF ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND WE FIVE HUNDRED PROJECTS WITH IT. THAT'S NOT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IT'S ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PROJECT AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY FOR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS TO ACHIEVE CONCENTRATED AND IMPACTFUL RESULTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. THIS IS ALSO EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF THE ANNUAL FUNDING CYCLE A NUMBER OF THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN TIME LIMITED TO EITHER TWELVE OR TWENTY FOUR MONTHS- SO YOU'RE RAMPING UP TRYING TO DO SOMETHING TO RAMP DOWN TO REPORT ON IT TO MEASURE THE IMPACT. AND THAT IN A LOAN RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STATE'S SUSTAINABILITY OF THE IMPACT OF THIS PROJECT SUMMERTIME. SO WITH THESE CONCERNS IN MIND IN TWENTY TWENTY. STATEWIDE EQUITY MEASURES WERE IMPLEMENTED TO ALLOW ALL OF US TO TRACK PROGRESS IN IN A BETTER WAY. WE SO FAR ANALYZE CHANGES FROM FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE YEAR BEFORE THE EQUITY GRANTS THROUGH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR- OF THE TWENTY ONE POPULATION LEVEL EQUITY MEASURES EIGHT OF THEM IMPROVED BY THREE POINTS OR MORE. TEN CHAU DOLLAR MINOR CHANGE AND THREE ACTUALLY SHOWED US IT WAS A LARGE CAP- NOTABLY TO WE WERE CONCERNED TO SEE THAT THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE SIX MEASURES THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HISPANIC OR SPEAK SPANISH. ALSO WE'RE CONTINUING TO IDENTIFY THINGS THAT THAT CONCERN US A GREAT DEAL WE'RE CONTINUING TO ANALYZE MORE RECENT DISPARITY DATA FROM BOTH OF US THAT AT TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SCHOOL YEAR IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES FISCAL YEAR- THERE IS ROOM FOR A LITTLE BIT OF OPTIMISM ONE PRELIMINARY FINDING THAT I'LL SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT AMONG INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE AT HOME THE RATIO OF. PER CAPITA- PURCHASE OF SERVICE SPENDING FOR ASIANS COMPARED TO WHITES IMPROVED IN SIX REGIONAL CENTERS. WELL THE PER CAPITA PURCHASE OF SERVICE SPENDING FOR BLACKS AND HISPANICS IMPROVED IN TEN OF THEM- SO WE DO THINK WE'RE MANAGING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE A LITTLE BIT LOOKING UP MORE CURRENT DATA- BUT OUR ANALYSIS YET ISN'T COMPLETE- GIVEN THE EARLIER INTERESTED. STATED IN THE AGENDA WITH OUR OUR PROPOSAL FOR COMMUNITY NAVIGATORS I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD A COUPLE COMMENTS ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCES WITH THOSE PROJECTS WHICH WE FIND THROUGH THIS DISPARITY GRANT PROGRAM. BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY ALL OF THE NAVIGATOR FOR PROJECTS FUNDED THROUGH THE GRANT ARE NOW REQUIRED TO COLLECT THE STANDARD SET OF DATA AND PROGRAM INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN AGGREGATE. DATA DATA AVAILABLE ON TO THE CONSUMER OUTCOMES. SO WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IT YET THE THEY EFFORT TO COLLECT THAT INFORMATION BEGAN IN THE LATE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY BETWEEN MARCH AND JUNE. OF TWENTY TWENTY. THIS SET OF INFORMATION WILL INCLUDE THE ASSISTANCE THAT FAMILIES RECEIVE AND ACCESSING MORE GENERIC SERVICES SUCH AS HOUSING SUPPORTS AN IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AS WELL AS CHANGES IN PURCHASE OF SERVICE DATA. WE ALSO HAVE SOME MORE QUALITATIVE DATA. THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT DATA BEFORE AND AFTER THE PRE AND POST SURVEYS OF KNOWLEDGE GAINED. AND OTHER QUALITATIVE IMPACTS ON FAMILIES PARTICIPANTS IN THESE PAST PROJECTS HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASED ABILITY TO NAVIGATE THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. INDICATED AND DEMONSTRATED MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GENERIC SERVICES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND ALSO A GREATER SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT AND SEEKING MANY TO SUPPORT. IN PART BECAUSE THEY NOW KNOW MORE. SO GIVEN SOME OF THESE LESSONS LEARNED AND DATA LIMITATIONS ON GOING FORWARD- ALL GRANT PROGRAMS WILL HAVE A SET OF MEASURES OF THE PROJECT IMPACTS IDENTIFIED IN DISCUSSION WITH THE DEPARTMENT. WHERE YOU CAN JUST STANDARDIZED THE PROJECTS IS SIMILAR TYPES HAVE SIMILAR MEASURES AS I JUST DESCRIBED FOR THE NAVIGATOR PROGRAMS PROJECTS. BOB WE WERE ALSO ASKING PROJECTS REPORT ON THEIR MEASURES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS- AND WE'RE GOING TO BE MORE ACTIVE IN OUR OVERSIGHT OF PROJECTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY REMAIN ON TRACK- WE WILL NOTE. IT'S AN ELEVEN MILLION DOLLAR pPROGRAM WE HAVEN'T- CARVED OUT FUNDING HISTORICALLY TO DO AN OUTCOME EVALUATION OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS DIRECTOR MARGIN INDICATED. WE HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO DO AN EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF THESE. ROGER X. HELLO AND WE INTEND TO BE A TARGET THAT EVALUATION NOT NOT- TO KIND OF COUNT WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF ACTIVITIES BUT TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF THOSE ACTED WE REALLY DON'T. OF COURSE MEETINGS WITH FAMILIES IS IMPORTANT BUT THE OUTCOME OF THAT MEETING FOR THE FAMILY IS WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO US AND SO THOSE ARE REALLY THE DRIVERS FOR OUR PROPOSAL FOR AN EVALUATION WHICH ALL TURNED TO MAX AND QUESTION FOR WE WERE ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE GENERAL TIMELINE HERE BOB SO- WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO STRUCTURE THE EVALUATION AND THE NECESSARY EXPERTISE FOR A CONTRACTOR- THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE WORK. WILL BE PLANNING TO ENGAGE WITH OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE AND ITS SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY WORKGROUP AND. OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE INPUT- OF WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE THE RIGHT. IN WAYS THAT LEAD TO QUANTIFIABLE ANSWERS ABOUT HOW WE'RE MOVING THE NEEDLE. ON ACCESS AND EQUITY MEASURES- AN ASSUMING THAT THE RESOURCES ARE THE REQUESTED RESOURCES ARE APPROVED FOR THIS EVALUATION. WE HAVE TO KIND OF PLANS AT THIS TIME TO DO THAT CONSULTATION AND THEN RELEASED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL A COUPLE MONTHS AFTER ENACTMENT OF THE BUDGET IN JULY. WITHOUT A ANTICIPATED AWARD BY THE END OF CALENDAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR WITH ACTUAL WORK BEGINNINGS- NOT IN SOMETIME IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND I THINK WE SAT I AM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CONCLUDE MY REMARKS ON THIS QUESTIONS. I THINK WE'LL HEAR FROM MISTER MISTER GOMEZ. VICE PRESIDENT DISABILITY VOICES UNITED. BERMAN M. SHERMAN DISTINGUISH COMMITTEE ON MY NAME IS FOR NUMBER GOMEZ I AM THE FATHER OF TWO CHILDREN IN MY FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WHO HAS DOWN SYNDROME. IT PRIOR TO PROVIDING YOU WITH MY TESTIMONY WEARING MY ADVOCATE HAVE I WANT TO CONTINUE. WEARING MY DAD HALF OF THIS IS US CURRENT ON YOUR- IN IN HIS THIS IS THE FACE OF ALL YOUR HARD WORK. CONSIDERATION IS GOING IN THIS OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT GOES BEYOND THE DATA IN IN IN STATISTICS THAT ARE SHARED. ARM HE IS A WRITER HE IS THE ONE WHO MOTIVATES US. IN IN SHARING AS A FATHER I WANTED TO COMMENT THAT. WE ARE PARTICIPANTS IN THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM WE'RE FORTUNATE WE DIDN'T MAKE THE FIRST ARE PART OF THE LOTTERY BUT WE ARE ABLE TO BE PART OF THE SECOND ROUND OF THE LOTTERY. IN THIS IS JANUARY THE SUBJECT COMMUNITY PROGRAM AND THE REASON I WANT TO SHARE THIS IS BECAUSE FOR US. AS A DIRECTOR BURGEONING SHARED IT MADE A HUGE WORLD THE DIFFERENCE IT GIVES CHOICE IT GIVES FLEXIBILITY GIVE US CONTROL. THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO THAT WE NEEDED. OUR FAMILIES THAT WE WORK WITH ESPECIALLY THE ONES IMPACTED BY DISPARITIES ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR THAT CHOICE. WITH A FLEXIBILITY FOR THAT CONTROL IN MANY OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE LOOKING TO COME ON BOARD. AS OF JUNE SEVENTH IF THAT IS THE DATE THAT THE ARM. THE LEVERAGE SPECIAL GUEST. YOU WILL SEE. A FULL TRANSITION OF THE COMMUNITY COME IN. WE ARE LOOKING TO BE ABLE TO GO BEYOND THE CURRENT LIMITATIONS AND BARRIERS THAT. SHOULD SELDOM TERMINATION BE A RESTAURANT I pCAN GUARANTEE YOU THERE WILL BE A LONG RUNNING AROUND THE BLOCK WAITED TO GET IN AND BE ABLE. TO THANK YOU OF THE DEATH OF. MOST OF THE VICE PRESIDENT OF DISABILITY VOCE ONE SECOND WE HAVE A DRINKING I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY. ARE YOU DOING SIR I DON'T KNOW MAYBE I'VE I AM LET ME JUST TURN OFF MY PHONE TO SEE IF IS THAT OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY HOPE THAT THERE'S NO MORE DIGGING OKAY- I'M VICE PRESIDENT DISABILITY VOICES UNITED WHERE AN ADVOCACY GROUP THAT'S DIRECTED BY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND FAMILIES I'M ALSO THE CO FOUNDER OF THE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE WE ARE AN ORGANIZATION THAT'S FUNDED THROUGH THE DDS DISPARITY CRACKED. UP PROGRAM THE ICC HELPS FAMILIESNAVIGATE THE SYSTEM AND WE BREAK OWN BARRIERS ON THE PEER TO PEER BASIS THROUGH A WHAT WE CALL OUR COMMUNITY IN THINKING ABOUT S. THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR THAT I AM TESTIFYING ABOUT THE SAME URGENT PROBLEMS AND DISPARITIES THAT ARE FACING OUR COMMUNITY AND OTHERS. I APPRECIATED THAT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THE VOICE OF OUR COMMUNITY. I WAS ASKED TO ADDRESS WHETHER DDS FUNDED PROJECTS TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES HAVE BEEN MAKING THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. BASED ON THE DATA. IT CLEAR IT IS CLEAR THAT THINGS ARE NOT GETTING BETTER. AFTER FIVE YEARS OF DISPARITY GRANTS LATINOS ASIANS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE STILL RECEIVING FEWER SERVICES THAN WHITES AND THE DISPARITIES CONTINUE TO WORSEN. DISABILITY VOICES UNITED ANALYZE THE MOST RECENT DATA AND WE FOUND THAT PROFOUND DISPARITIES STILL EXIST IN ALL TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS PARTICULARLY WITH WHAT THE LATINOS. FOR EXAMPLE. AFTER THE FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO SPEND ON GROUNDS. INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. DIRECTLY TO REGIONAL CENTRES THERE WAS ONLY THREE REGIONAL CENTERS OUT OF THE TWENTY ONE. THAT PROVIDED THE LATINOS HALF OF WHAT THE WHITES RECEIVED ONLY HALF. AN ALL THE OTHERS PROVIDED LESS IN THAT HOUSE. NOW WE HEAR THAT THE REASON IS PROBABLY BECAUSE THE LATINO COMMUNITY TEACH OUR CHILDREN. AT HOME INTO ADULTHOOD. BUT EVEN WHEN YOU COMPARE THE LATINO ADULTS WHO WHY DID THOSE THAT ARE LIVING AT HOME THE DISPARITIES REMAIN. AND WHILE ASIANS AND AFRICANS AMERICANS DON'T FACE THE SAME LEVEL OF DISPARITIES THEY ARE STILL FACING SIGNIFICANT INEQUITIES ARE THE MEASURE ANY MEASURE. MANY PEOPLE OF COLOR CONTINUE TO REPORT FEELING INTIMIDATED. AN OVERWHELMED BY THE SYSTEM AND ARE SOMETIMES THE WE'RE AFRAID TO SPEAK UP IN FEAR RETALIATION WE NEED TO SEE MORE OF A CULTURAL CHANGE AT THE REGIONAL CENTER LEVEL. WE SEE MORE OF A CULTURAL. HUMILITY TO BE IMPLEMENTED. WE DO NOT DENY THAT THE REAL BY A SUCCESS WE NEED TO STOP ATTRIBUTING DISPARITIES TO THE ETHNIC CULTURES OF FAMILIES OR THEIR LACK OF EDUCATION OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WE MOVED WE NEED TO MOVE INTO A CULTURE OF HUMILITY EMPATHY OF THE ACCEPTANCE AND SUPPORT. REGIONAL CENTERS NEED TO MAKE A CONCENTRATED EFFORT TO MEET FAMILIES WHERE THEY'RE AT AT EVERY LEVEL. I WAS ALSO ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE TWO NEW PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR THE FIRST IS TO FIND A ONE TIME INDEPENDENT. EVALUATION ON THE DISPARITY PROJECTS. THIS IS AN ACTION THAT DISABILITY VOICES UNITED HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THIS REQUEST AND WE SUPPORTED. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE EVALUATION BE FROM THE COMMUNITIES PERSPECTIVES. ABOUT THE EVALUATORS MUST HAVE DIRECT INDEPENDENT ACCESS TO THE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROJECTS. MANY OF THE PROJECTS ARE NOT RUN BY CBO'S BUT BY THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOT LED BY PARENTS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THESE GET EVALUATED AS WELL. THE PROPOSAL WAS TO SPEND THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THE COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR PROGRAM BASED IN THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER. WHERE WE SEE THE VALUE OF FAMILY RESOURCE CENTRES WITHOUT A DOUBT AND WE BELIEVE THAT MORE PEER TO PEER SUPPORT WOULD BE HELPFUL. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE ENGAGEMENT WITH FAMILIES WILL BE LIMITED. BECAUSE TRUE COMMUNITY OUT REACH HAS TO BE NEUTRAL AND UNBIASED MANY SEE THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS AS AN EXTENSION OF REGIONAL CENTERS THE PROMOTER AND THE NAVIGATOR PROGRAMS THAT THEY REPRESENT THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS REACHING OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT LOYALTY IS OFTEN PERCEIVED TO BE THE SYSTEM THAT THEY REPRESENT. A PROGRAM LIKE THE INTAKE OF O. AS IN OTHERS ARE DESIGNED TO OUT REACH INTO FROM THE COMMUTE BACK INTO THE REGIONAL CENTER. IT IS FROM FAMILIES PERSPECTIVES FROM OUR ISSUES ARE CHALLENGES IN OUR NEEDS. WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR THE NAVIGATOR PROGRAM TO SUCCEED TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL. IT WILL REQUIRE COLLABORATION TO INCLUDE CPOS. WHO ALREADY HAVE AN ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST OF RESPECT AND VALIDATION WITH FAMILIES. DESPITE THE LACK OF PROGRESS WE ARE HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IN IT COULD REALLY PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OUR COMMUNITY IS WAKING UP AND OUR VOICES ARE BECOMING MORE UNITED. MORE FAMILIES ARE FEELING INFORMED AND EMPOWERED BECAUSE F THE HARD WORK OF THIS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WE ARE REALIZING THAT EACH ONE OF US HAS TO BE THE CHANGE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SO HARD TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM. SO THE FAMILIES THEMSELVES IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS WILL MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. WE CAN ONLY HELP PEOPLE ONE BY ONE BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE A SYSTEM CHANGE AS WELL NOW WE KNOW THAT THE DIRECTOR BARGE MAN AND HER STAFF ARE COMMITTED TO MOVING THE NEEDLE. IN SOME REGIONAL STAFFS ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH US AS PARTNERS THERE IS STILL SO MUCH WORK THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE. TO SUCCESSFULLY WORK WITH UNDERSERVED FAMILIES WE HAVE LEARNED THAT WE NEED TO HOLD HANDS AND EMPOWER THEM WE ALSO LEARNED THAT EVERYONE MUST BE EQUAL PARTNERS AT THE TABLE TO HELP MAKE THE MANY CHANGES THAT ARE STILL NEED TO. OUR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WE THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR INPUT AND I'M WONDERING IF- IF DIRECTOR BARGER HAS ANY THOUGHTS OR RESPONSES- TO MR GOMES. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- ALWAYS APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ITH MR GOMEZ AND MANY OF THE OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND- THEIR PARTICIPATION NOT ONLY IN OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE BUT IT'S REALLY MORE. AN ORGANIC HAS REALLY BEEN- KIND OF OUR STAR IN IN MANY OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD- THAT THE RECOMMENDATION AND DESIRE FROM MR GOMEZ TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE- COMMITTEE NAVIGATOR PROGRAM- LOCKED HANDS. WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- I IS ABSOLUTELY AN EXPECTATION THAT WE SHOULD HAVE- SO THOSE ARE HE THINGS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD AND TO KIND OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND MAKING SURE. THAT THERE IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT THE ONE OF THE GREATEST OUTCOMES OF THE ELEVEN MILLION OF KIND OF THE GRANT PROGRAM. IS RAISING UP THE FACE- AND THE VOICE OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WE HAVE ESTABLISHED WITHIN OUR NETWORK A REMARKABLE COMMUNITY AND WE CAN'T WE CAN'T DO. REALLY ANY OF THOSE WORK WHETHER IT'S THAT COMMITTEE NAVIGATOR PROGRAM OR ANY OTHER INITIATIVES WITHOUT THEM- AND I REALLY HOPE WE BRING ON NEW PARTNERS AS WELL YOU NEED TO BASED ORGANIZATIONS WE STILL HAVE SOME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. ARE NOT REPRESENTED IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT I REALLY BELIEVE WE NEED TO BUILD BUILD UP IN OUR OUR NETWORK AS WELL- CERTAINLY WITHIN THE PANDEMIC OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THEIR ROLE IN DOING OUTREACH- A DISTRIBUTING- PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT- DOING OUTREACH TO GET INFORMATION- TO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND GETTING FOOD TO PEOPLE- WAS INVALUABLE AND WE SEE A SIMILAR ROLE- RELATED TO. THIS INITIATIVE AS WELL. THANK YOU. OKAY GET THE YOU MISTER MISTER GOMEZ A CERTAIN OUR STAR BUT I BUT I WOULD OFFER THERE'S A LOT OF STARS OUT NOTS GUY. WHO WERE WHO ARE STAND READY AND WILLING AND ABLE TO ASSIST YOU AND JUST YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL THINK ABOUT FROM OUR OWN PERSPECTIVE OUR OWN WORLD I CAN CERTAINLY THINK AND IN MY OWN COMMUNITY. IT'S A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION. WORKING WITH LATINO COMMUNITY IN THE API I. AFRICAN COMMUNITY ARE OUT THERE MAKING SURE PEOPLE GET TO MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAVE FOOD AND DIAPERS AND VACCINATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION SO- RIGHT IT IS NOT IT IS NOT US IS THE GOVERNMENT WAS OUT THERE DOING IT IT IS OUR PARTNERS WHO ARE DOING THAT WORK. ENOUGH AND CERTAINLY WOULD APPRECIATE ANY I THINK ANY EXTRA GRANTS ARE OPPORTUNITIES THAT COME THEIR WAY. TO CONTINUE THE WORK THAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THAT BEST A RELATIONSHIP THEY ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED SO. I LOOK FORWARD IN HEARING HOW WE'RE PROGRESSING IN THAT JOINING OF HANDS GOING FORWARD. I MAY NOT ENSURE JUST ADD ONE TO YOUR POINTS- AND THAT IS REALLY THE PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT FORWARD RECOGNIZING THE VALUE THAT OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- HAD. AND PARTICIPATING IN THE GRANT PROGRAM. IS THAT'S WHY THE PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT FORWARD IS ACTUALLY OUTSIDE OF THE GRANT PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM ANY OF THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO CONTINUE THEIR GOOD WORK AND EVEN- ENHANCE- AND IT JUST ALL AREAS THE THANK YOU. THAT'S GREAT AND I WOULD. AND I'M SURE YOU'RE YOU'RE ALREADY DOING THIS BUT IT WOULD BE SOME KIND OF PARTICIPATORY EVALUATION THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BRING AND ALL ARE. ALL OUR NORTH STARS. LOL AS YOUR HAND UP- THANK YOU MANAGER SYMPATHETIC FROM THE L. A. O. AND- JUST HEAD TO UNDERSCORE THE LAST COMMENT THAT WAS THAT YOU JUST MADE ACTUALLY- WE JUST HAVE- ONE RECOMMENDATION OR SUGGESTION IN THIS AREA WHICH IS TO REALLY ENSURE SO WE THE MINISTRATION DISCUSSED- THE BILL THE WAY IN WHICH IT WILL EVALUATE. THE PAST GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO REDUCE DISPARITIES IN WE WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF A FORMAL EVALUATION OF THIS NEW. STATEWIDE EFFORT IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO APPROVE FUNDING FOR THE COMMUNITY NAVIGATORS PROGRAM. YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TIME THERE WAS A STATEWIDE EFFORTS- IN THE DDS DEPARTMENT IN IN THE DISPARITIES AREA. AND IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE REALLY A FORMAL EVALUATION OF ITS- EFFECTIVENESS. AND TO DO THAT IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE BEST TO REALLY BUILD IN THE NECESSARY DESIGN FEATURES AND MEASUREMENTS- AD METRICS REALLY FROM THAT FROM THE OUTSET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU I WAS UP. WHO'S GOING TO ASK THAT THAT IT IN IN MY EXPERIENCE THAT WE GENERALLY I MEAN THE BEST PROJECTS HAVE THE EVALUATION BUILT INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION IN THE PLANNING. OF IT SO YOU CAN WRAP YOUR ARMS AROUND FROM THE BEGINNING AND DON'T GO OFF IN A DIRECTION THAT YOU HAVEN'T. FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MEASURE SO I WOULD- I WOULD CONCUR THAT THE EVALUATION PLAN NEEDS TO BE PART OF. THE BEGINNING. A DEPEND. I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND I DO I KNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATE- APARTMENT GETTING BACK ON THE NUMBER OF VISITORS TO THE WEB PAGE AS WE VAST- A FIRST QUESTION ACTUALLY FOR. MR GOMEZ. WITH THE DISABILITY VOICES UNITED- THANK YOU YOU MADE REFERENCE IN YOUR TESTIMONY TO INTIMIDATION THIS IS SOMETHING I ALSO HEARD SEVERAL YEARS AGO- CAN YOU ELABORATE ON ON ON THIS PROBLEM ABOUT. FAMILIES OF COLOR FEELING INTIMIDATED. ABSOLUTELY- THANK YOU SENATOR PAN- WITH THE QUESTION IN ADDITION TO THAT INTIMIDATION HAND IN HAND GOES WHAT WE CALL THE CULTURAL HUMILITY IN MANY CASES WERE FINDING OUT THAT- A LOT OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS. WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD WHETHER THERE'S INTERACTION WITH OUR FAMILIES WE'RE SEEING THAT THAT THIS IS NOT A PRACTICE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF TIMES. FAMILIES THEY FEEL ARE ARE DOWN TO THEY THEY STILL MADE A FAIRER- AND IT'S ALREADY A REALLY COMPLICATED SYSTEM TO NAVIGATE THROUGH. AND WHEN A PARENT DOES. FEEL EMPOWERED AND GETS TO A POINT WHERE THERE ARE. ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS THEN A LOT OF TIMES THEY FEEL THAT STRONG PUSHBACK IN IN IN ITS PERCEIVED AS IN DATA INTIMIDATION. IN MANY CASES- THAT PUSHBACK IS AUTOMATICALLY SENT THROUGH TO WHAT THEY CALL IT A FAIR HEARING WHICH- WOULD PROBABLY THIS THERE'S NOTHING FAIR ABOUT A FAIR HEARING WHEN IT COMES TO OUR COMMUNITY. OKAY ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE THE FOLLOW UP ON THAT- YOU KNOW I IF IT THINK- APPRECIATE THIS- PROPOSAL- THAT'S FOR US AND WHAT WE LEARNED FROM SOME THE PREVIOUS PROJECTS- BUT I THINK I KNOW THAT- ADDRESS BAR TONIGHT'S HATS MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THIS ISSUE SPEND LONG STANDING UP BEFORE I EVEN WAS ON THE SUB COMMITTEE WE WERE DEALING WITH THAT AND WE'VE BEEN DEALING. FOR MANY YEARS- I GUESS YOU KNOW WHAT WELL ONE OF THE- AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE GRANTS WE HAVE PROGRAMS I THINK ONE THINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE- IS ABOUT ALSO CHANGING THE CULTURE WITHIN. THE THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND SO FORTH- AS WELL SO IT'S MORE- TO TRY TO MAKE IT MORE WELCOMING FOR PEOPLE- FOR AGAIN- FAMILIES OF COLOR AND AGAIN THE DISPARITY STILL PERSIST I APPRECIATE I HEAR APPROVED MEANT I HAVEN'T HEARD MAGNITUDE SO- SO I'VE HEARD WHAT I'VE HEARD SOME TESTIMONY SAYING THAT THINGS HAVE. GONE THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD MAGNITUDE OF THE MOVE LIKE SO. AND WE'RE HEARING TESTIMONY FROM DISBELIEF VOICES UNITED THAT ACTUALLY THE MOVEMENT ISN'T ALL THAT GREAT- SO IN ADDITION TO PROGRAMS ARE UNDER STANDARDS ARE BEING PUT IN PLACE FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY PASSED A LAW SAYING THAT- BOARDS- CORPORATE BOARDS SHOULD HAVE. AT LEAST SOME REPRESENTATION OF- YOU KNOW OF THIS VENTURE YEAH PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES UNDER CORPORATE BOARDS. YOU THINK THAT REGIONAL CENTER SHOULD TO DO EVEN MORE THAN A CORPORATE BOARD SHOULD. SO ARE THEIR STANDARDS FOR- DIVERSITY ON THE BOARDS OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND ALSO STAFF- TO THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS SET OR- OR THAT- IT THAT'S BEING SET. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE- IT MORE. BASICALLY SURE WE A- VOICES IN THE GOVERNANCE OF- THESE VERY IMPORTANT THAT INSTITUTIONS. THANK YOU DR PAN- CURRENTLY THERE IS AND HAS BEEN- GOSH I CAN'T REMEMBER A TIME WHEN IT WAS- BROUGHT INTO TWO LOTS BEEN MANY MANY MANY YEARS- THAT THAT THE BOARDS OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE TO REPRESENT THEIR COMMUNITY- SO THAT DIVERSITY AND WE TRACK AS A DEPARTMENT WE TRACKED THAT BY- AND YOUR REVIEW- AND REQUIRE REGIONAL CENTERS IF THEY ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE- BUT WITH- THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR COMMUNITY. AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN ON HOW TO ACHIEVE- TO ACHIEVE THAT. IN ADDITION- RECENTLY SOME OF THE OTHER- AREAS IN WHICH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BOARD WAS INFORMED OF THESE ISSUES IS THAT IF IT WASN'T LAST YEAR IS THAT PRIOR YEAR- WE HAD PROPOSED AND THERE IS ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE- THAT WAS WAS ADDED. ON TO REQUIRE REGIONAL CENTERS TO- PRESENT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THEIR- DISPARITY KIND OF- THAT THE INFORMATION AND- THEIR PROPOSALS AND THEIR PLANS BEFORE SUBMITTING TO THE DEPARTMENT. IS WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BOARDS ALSO HAD AN INCREASED AWARENESS. OF THE- THE INFORMATION THAT THE COMMUNITY IS SHARING- WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER AS WELL AS THEIR DATA RELATED TO PURCHASE OF SERVICE- WE ALSO IN ADDITION BECAUSE- BEING. A MISTER GOMEZ AND OTHERS HAVE SHARED- THE CONCERN ABOUT THE- ACCESS OR THE- FAIRNESS BE KIND OF APPROACH TO FAIR HEARINGS AND THAT IS THE- DUE PROCESS THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM HAS AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR- SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY WORKGROUP AND EVALUATE. YOU KNOW IS THERE- ALTERNATIVES- THAT WE COULD- HAVE AVAILABLE TO- PROVIDE A REVIEW- UNDER DUE PROCESS AND- BECAUSE THOSE ARE CERTAINLY ISSUES THE CULTURE- WE PRIORITIZED- DISPARITY- GRANTS WE WANTED TO HAVE CULTURAL SENSITIVITY AND- TRAINING- WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS- THIS IS AN AREA THAT I THINK WE CAN DO MORE- WE'VE WE HAVE BEEN TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCE- CAN I TRAININGS THAT HAVE. REALLY POSITIVE KIND OF OUTCOMES AND IMPACT WHETHER IT'S IMPLICIT BIAS OR CULTURAL SENSITIVITY- SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY EXPLORING- THERE WAS. ALSO. THAT THE STANDARD INFORMATION PACKETS- THAT WE INTRODUCED- BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FAMILIES HAVE SHARED- EVEN ENTERING INTO THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION WHICH AN INCREASE DISPARITIES- SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- WERE INTRODUCED IN THAT WE'RE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF HAVING- THAT. AVAILABLE AS WELL- AND I HAD ONE FINAL THOUGHT AND I APOLOGIZE THAT IT'S LESLIE SAID IT TAKEN NOTE- MAYBE SOMETHING TRIGGER AND I'LL CIRCLE BACK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON IT. OKAY SHE US- I US SEEM LIKE A- AGAIN- MAY THE STAFF ARE REALLY- IT I THINK THAT- YOU WE'VE WE'VE TOUCHED ON THESE BEFORE WHEN WE HAD AND OUR CONVERSATIONS I THINK. GOT THIS POINT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO. ANDTALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR A CULTURAL CHANGE- WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE SOME SORT OF- AB AND APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION TO HAVE SOME REPORT ON SOME UNKNOWN WHERE WE ARE WITH THE AMPLE ARE. ALL OUR- REGIONAL CENTERS THAT THEY HAD TO DIVERSITY PARK IT'S WHAT ARE TODAY IT'S ADDRESS SO- AND ALSO IN TERMS OF OUR STAFFING AS WELL. SO I DO APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS DEPARTMENT IS MAKING AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS THAT- WE'VE TALKED ABOUT- SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND I. APPRECIATE PRESENTATION SHOWS THAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THIS- WELL WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO AND I THINK AND CERTAINLY DON'T WANTTO UNDERMINE THE- PROJECTS ARE BEING PROPOSED BUT I THINK WAS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. PROJECTS ARE GREAT BUT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE ITSELF OF THE INSTITUTION OTHERWISE- YOU KNOW- HERE'S YOUR PROJECT OVER HERE SO- THE DM EVALUATION CERTAINLY'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT AS WELL- AND- SO- IT AGAIN LOOKING FORWARD TO- FOLLOWING UP ON. ON THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEING MADE THAT- THAT. THAT YOU'VE DISCUSSED SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND INDIRECT BORDER- THERE ARE CALLED. SPECIALIST AT EACH SHOW REGIONAL. AND A THEY GOING IN ON ON THE- GROUND THE CLIMATE IF YOU WERE. OF THE BEACH REGIONAL AND PER. INPUT AND- HELP. YEAH THERE IF WE DO- WE FIND IT. MITCHELL SPECIALIST AND EVERY REGIONAL CENTER- AS AS MR DRIPPING ED NOTED AND THEN ALSO THE DEPARTMENTS- WE HAVE AN APARTMENT ALSO BRING TOGETHER THE CULTURAL SPECIALIST I REALLY PLEASED WITH OUR REORGANIZATION WHICH MR WINFIELD HAD TALKED ABOUT A RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC BUT ONE OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO ALSO ENHANCES THE DEPARTMENT- WAS ADDING A COUPLE POSITIONS TO OUR SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY- OFFICE. AND THIS TEAM HAS ABSOLUTELY PULL TOGETHER AND OF AN ORGANIZED APPROACH NOT ONLY WORKING WITH A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- BUT ALSO HAVING REGULAR MEETINGS AND TRAININGS WITH THE CULTURAL SPECIALIST AT THE REGIONAL CENTERS. I'M SO THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS COULD HAVE CERTAINLY ORGANIZED- THOSE EFFORTS- BUT MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND REALLY PLEASED THAT- THE POSITIONS ARE THERE AND PLEASE THAT- MAY NOT A WALTER IS ORGANIZING FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME CONTINUITY IN TRAINING- THAT IS ALSO IN COLLABORATION. WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND IS A THE FEE GO WAYS LIKE WITH THE NOW. IN THE PROMO THE LAST DIGIT MEAN THERE YOU'RE REACHING OUT TO TED. FAMILIES ARE THEY ALSO TAKE OUT OF. BACK TO. THE AIRFORCE IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS ABOUT THE BARRIERS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE REPORTING WHY THEY DON'T REACH OUT. I'LL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT TO WHAT DEGREE- I'M INCLINED TO SAY THAT IN SOME WAYS THERE'S REALLY STRONG KIND OF. HERE COMMUNICATION THAT IS DEFINITELY HAPPENING BECAUSE I'VE SEEN SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS WHERE THERE'S A REAL COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN- THE CBO'S OR THE FRC'S IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS- BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW SOME AREAS WHERE THERE THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE SOME RELATIONSHIPS THAT THAT. NEED TO BE ENHANCED AND- HEELS YOU KNOW AND ADDS THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW CERTAINLY SOME TRUST ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE OVERCOME WE HAVE SOME WORK IN THAT DEPARTMENT THAT WE NEED TO DO- BUT SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A MIX OF BOTH. AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR- SOME GROWTH. MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN STANDARDIZE GOING FORWARD. IF YOU. OKAY ANYTHING FROM THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE ON THIS BEFORE WE MOVE ON. TO BINANCE NOTHING AT OKAY ALL RIGHT SO ISSUE NUMBER SIX. THANK YOU- THAT INTERNET DEPARTMENT- I GONNA GO AHEAD AND HAVE- ACRYLIC HALF NATIVE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE TRAILER BILL AND THEN ALL- ADDRESS THAT THAT NEXT COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND CLOSING OUT THE AGENDA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR SIMILAR. THANK YOU BECAUSE THE OTHER WITH THE DEPARTMENT- TRAILER ITEMS IT REFLECTS TO ISSUES THE FIRST ONE IS THE ACUTE CRISIS CLARIFICATION AND MISSION EXTENSION. THIS LANGUAGE EXTENDS THE AVAILABILITY OF CANYON SPRINGS FOR THE STABILIZATION TRAINING ASSISTANCE AND REINTEGRATION SERVICES WHILE ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES. IT ALSO PROVIDES CLARIFICATION FOR ADMISSION TO KEEP PRICES PROGRAMS AND APPROVED BY THE DIRECTOR FOR PLACEMENTS TO THE PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY IT PROVIDES IF YOU CLEAN UP REFERENCES TO CINEMATOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. THE SECOND TRAILER ISSUE IS FACILITIES FOR SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS AND THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE REMOVES THE RESTRICTION FOR DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF THE ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER CLOSURE. IT AUTHORIZES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SIMILAR MODEL FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS. THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR REGIONAL CENTERS TO TRANSITION INDIVIDUALS FROM OR AVOID EACH. PLACEMENT IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WERE LARGE CONGREGATE SETTINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DIRECTOR MARJORIE WANNA PICK UP FROM THERE YES PLEASE THANK YOU- SO I'VE BEEN- ASKED TO ADDRESS. TWO OTHER QUESTIONS- ONE IS TO- FURTHER DISCUSS KIND OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND THOSE REALLY EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH NEED. PARTICULARLY INDIVIDUALS WITH CHALLENGING I'M KIND OF BEHAVIORAL SUPPORT NEEDS AS WELL AS HEALTH CARE NEEDS- WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON OUR SAFETY NET FOR THE LAST- PAST FIVE YEARS AT LEAST YOU KNOW SINCE% THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CLOSURE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND THEN. WITH THE CLOSURE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS- WEDID HAVE A NEED TO KIND OF BUILD THE COMMUNITY CAPACITY TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH VERY HIGHLY COMPLEX NEEDS- JUST AS A QUICK UPDATE OR ENHANCE IT. ENHANCE VEHICLE SUPPORTS HOMES WHICH WAS NEARED AFTER THE ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES FOR PERSONS WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS- WE HAVE FORTY OF THOSE HOMES THAT ARE COMPLETED WE HAVE THIRTY SEVEN AND PROGRESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- MORE RECENTLY WE HAD A SORORITY TO DEVELOP COMMITTEE CRISIS HOMES FOR ADULTS- WE HAVE THIRTEEN OF THOSE THAT ARE COMPLETED AND THEN WE HAVE NINE AM PROGRESS AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND- IN. THE LAST YEAR WE ALSO RECEIVED AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP- COMMITTEE CRISIS HOMES FOR CHILDREN- WE HAD PRIOR APPROVAL FOR ADULTS AS I JUST NOTED- AND THEN ALSO PRIOR APPROVAL FOR THE ENHANCE BUREAU SUPPORTS HOMES FOR KIDS- WE HAVE FOUND THAT WHERE ARE EMERGING NEEDS PRIMARILY IS WITH CHILDREN. ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN- WE WERE SEEN VERY CALM NEEDS PARTICULARLY. INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE AUTISM AND CO OCCURRING NEEDS BUT THEN ALSO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DEVELOPED DEVELOPER THE DISABILITY AND CO OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS- SO FOR CHILDREN WE HAVE SEVEN HOMES THAT ARE IN PROGRESS FOR COMMUNITY CRISIS- AND THESE WOULD BE INTENDED TO BE TIME LIMITED WITH THE INTENT. OF HAVING KIDS GO BACK HOME- IT IT DEFINITELY IS INTENDED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER- AND THEN NAY ENHANCE BIRO SUPPORTS HOMES WEEK WE HAVE SEVEN THAT ARE COMPLETE AND WE HAVE NINE IN PROGRESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND THIS KIND OF LEADS TO. SOME OF THE WORK THAT- IS NOTED I CANYON SPRINGS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO EXTEND THAT SUNSET- AND IT WAS PURPOSEFULLY KIND OF PUT IN THERE WHEN- THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED- PARTICULARLY-BECAUSE- YOU KNOW. OUR EVERYBODY OUR EFFORTS AND CERTAINLY ADVOCATES HAD HAD REALLY NOTED THAT DID NOT WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS IN LARGER CONGREGATE SETTINGS THAT REALLY HAVING. KIND OF THOSE STARS SERVICES THAT ARE IN THE COMMUNITY WITH FOUR OR FIVE INDIVIDUALS- MORE MUCH MORE ADEPT TO A HOME LIKE SETTING- THAT SAID WE'VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE. OF A TORTILLA I BELIEVE IT'S- A TOTAL OF. SEVEN HOMES THAT WE CAN HAVE IN THE STATE OF OUR START- SERVICES. ONE OF THE HOMES- WE HAD REPORTED- WE HAVE THREE HOMES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE BEFORE INDIVIDUALS HAD MOVED IN WHICH WAS. FOR ADOLESCENTS HAD BURNED DOWN. AND THIS WAS A REAL BIG. STEP FOR US IT WAS ONLY A MONTH AWAY. FROM BEING ABLE PROVIDE SERVICES- IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FOR THE TWO HOMES THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED IN THAT AREA FORTUNATELY WE'RE ABLE TO. TEMPORARILY PROVIDE SERVICES OVER AT PORTER BILLS- DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER- FOR ADOLESCENTS NOT IDEAL STUDYING WE REALLY WANT TO GET THEM INTO RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS. THE MARKET RIGHT NOW IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE FOR HOUSING- HOUSES ARE YOU KNOW BEFORE AND HOUSING DEVELOPERS ARE GETTING OFFERS AND- THE HOUSES ARE ARE GOING OFF THE MARKET SO THERE'S A UNIQUE CHALLENGE THAT THAT- WE'RE FACING- PARTICULAR WITH THAT- AND THEN ALSO WITH OUR TWO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOMES THAT- WILL NOW BE READY IN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO. WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THAT AREA BECAUSE OF KOBE IS. A PART OF THAT HAD TO DO WITH PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO GO OUT A PLEA TO UNDO THE CONSTRUCTION ARE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE PERMITTING- BUT BECAUSE OF THESE UNFORTUNATE DELAYS WE ARE ASKING FOR THIS EXTENSION THESE ARE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED- AND- AGAIN- IDENTIFYING A PARTICULAR NEED FOR CHILDREN- WE- WE ARE SEEN. WE HAVE FOR OUR STAR SERVICES I HAVE ABOUT SIXTEEN KIDS ON THE WAIT LIST FOR OUR KIDS SERVICES- WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO- WORK WITH OUR OUR- CHILDREN'S FACILITIES IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEN WHAT ARE START TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT. BUT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY AT- CANYON SPRINGS THAT WOULD- PROBABLY REDUCE. OUR ABILITY TO SERVE ON SOME OF THE GREATEST. NEEDS IN CALIFORNIA AT THIS POINT. HAPPY TO ANSWER.

THAT I'VE GONE THROUGH WE'VE SEEN SO MUCH CHANGE AND WE REALLY FEEL FOR THEM AND THE STRESS OF THE ADDITIONAL- ADDITIONAL WEIGHT HAS REALLY PLAYED A ROLE ON THEIR ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOB THEY DO THEIR VERY BEST. THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN MY FILE TAKES LONGER AND LONGER TO SERVE AND A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS THAT WE HAVE RECENTLY OFFER A PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE AND OUR SERVICE COORDINATOR TOOK TEN DAYS IN ORDER TO YOU KNOW THE DOCTOR THAT SHE WAS WORKING ON IT SHE JUST DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO EVEN EMAIL ME BACK AND I REALLY FEEL FOR HER- WHEN I SPOKE TO HER I COULD TELL THAT SHE WAS OVERWHELMED AND DOCTORS AND EVEN INCLUDE THE THINGS THAT GO ON WITHIN. THIS YEAR WITH THE PANDEMIC EVERYBODY'S WORKING FROM HOME IT'S EVEN WORSE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE NEEDED- WITHIN THEIR STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE THE WEIGHT OF ANY ONE PERSON MISSING ON EVERYBODY ELSE SO- I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THEY'RE WALKING REYES WAS I'VE NO IDEA WHEN DO YOU.
