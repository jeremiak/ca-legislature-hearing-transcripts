NOW IF I CAN I WANT TO GIVE A FEW OPENING REMARKS TO HELP US TO FRAME TODAY'S DISCUSSION. BECAUSE THIS PANDEMIC AND THE DEVASTATION MUST BE A CATALYST FOR CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT RACISM HAS CAUSED LASTING AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE NEED TO MARSHAL ALL THE ATTENTION AND RESOURCES OF OUR GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE TOWARDS ADDRESSING RACISM. FOR WHAT WE WILL HEAR TODAY IS THAT OUR CASELOADS FOR MANY OF OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS ARE DOWN. AND IT LEADS US TASK WHY AND DO WE NEED OUT OF REACH HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT OUR ORIENTED AND MORE HUMAN CENTERED. BECAUSE WHAT WE WILL ALSO HERE TODAY IS THAT NEARLY FOUR OUT OF FIVE FAMILIES FROM BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET RIGHT NOW. THE NEED IS THERE AND I ASKED US IN GOVERNMENTS TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND TO COMMIT TO PASSING ANTI RACIST POLICIES. TO EVALUATE OUR PROGRAMS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WORK FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT I HAVE THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING. WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING AND BEGIN WITH PANEL ONE. FOR OUR PANELISTS. AS WE BEGIN IF YOU CAN JUST PRESENT IN THE ORDER THAT YOUR NAMES APPEAR ON THE AGENDA AND PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO THE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN REQUESTED WITHIN THE AGENDA WE WILL HOLD ALL THE MEMBERS QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE PANELISTS HAVE CONCLUDED. WE HAVE TWELVE TOTAL PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL STARTING WITH SERRA BOND. VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH AND SENIOR FELLOW AT THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. PLEASE BEGIN MISBACH. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR DR ARAMBULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS TERRIBLE AND I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH AT THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA I'D LIKE TO MAKE FOUR POINTS TODAY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AS A RESEARCHER STUDYING LONG TERM TRENDS IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND POVERTY IN THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET. FIRST THE DEFINING FEATURE OF THIS RECESSION IS A BIFURCATION AND DISPARITIES IN OPPORTUNITY. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CURRENTLY STANDS AT 9% BUT IT IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER FOR LATINO AND BLACK WORKERS FOR THOSE WITHOUT A COLLEGE EDUCATION. AND AMONG LOWER INCOME FAMILIES. THESE DISPARITIES PREDATE COVERT NINETEEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC EVEN WITH THE STRONGEST IMPROVEMENTS FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES WE'VE SEEN ABOUT FORTY YEARS ONE FIFTH OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES FOR RELYING ON FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS PER YEAR. WORSE STILL BLACK AND LATINO FAMILIES WERE ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO BE AND THAT'S LOWER INCOME GROUP. WHERE WE ARE TODAY IS THE RESULT OF A FOUR DECADE TREND TOWARDS GREATER INCOME INEQUALITY AND STAGNANT PROPERTY. SECOND EVERY RECESSION IN THE PAST FOUR DECADES HAS EXACERBATED ECONOMIC DISPARITIES THE ONE EXCEPTION IS THE DOT COM BUST. MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES TOOK TEN TO TWELVE YEARS TO RECOVER FROM THE GREAT RECESSION AND A BIT LONGER AND SOME PARTS OF THE STATE SO MANY FAMILIES BARELY CAUGHT THEIR BREATH BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC HIT. WE DO EXPECT THAT THIS RECOVERY MAY BE FASTER HOPEFULLY WILL BE FASTER BUT ALL RECESSION HAVE A LAG. AND SO AND THAT LIKE IT'S FELT MORE SEVERELY FOR LOWER INCOME FAMILIES. SO WE REALLY MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT EVEN WHEN THE ECONOMY WIDE METRIC START TO LOOK BETTER LIKE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. THE RECESSION WILL STILL LIKELY BE FELT VERY STRONGLY FOR MANY CALIFORNIA. THIRD WE NOW KNOW A LOT ABOUT WHAT WORKS TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND EAT. AND TYPICAL TIMES WE KNOW FROM THE PP I SEIZE DOWN FOR CALIFORNIA POVERTY MEASURE THAT MAJOR STATE AND FEDERAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS KEEP NEARLY THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS OUT OF POVERTY EVERY YEAR. INCLUDING ONE MILLION CHILDREN. CALFRESH IN TAX CREDITS ARE THE BIGGEST POVERTY REDUCERS FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN FOLLOWED BY CAL WORKS. THESE PROGRAMS ACTUALLY SUPPORT MANY MANY MORE CALIFORNIANS IF WE LOOK BEYOND THE POVERTY SNAPSHOT AND THINK ABOUT WELL BEING OVER TIME. AND RECENT RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT CALFRESH CAL WORKS OR BOTH. AT SOME POINT DURING THEIR FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE. WE ALSO FOUND THAT IN THE LAST RECESSION. THE ONLY WITH CHILDREN FELL DEEPER IN NEED SO THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO RELY ON BOTH CALFRESH AND CAL WORK WHEN IN REGULAR TIMES THEY MAY HAVE JUST BEEN- SUPPORTED BY CALFRESH SO CALIFORNIA'S ROBUST POWERS PROGRAM RELATIVE TO OTHER STATES REALLY PROVIDED VITAL SUPPORT IN THE LAST RECESSION. ONE FACTOR THAT MIGHT MAKE THE NEED DIFFERENT THIS TIME IS THE SCALE OF THE FEDERAL STIMULUS THERE IS SOME CONSENSUS I BELIEVE AMONG RESEARCH THAT THE INITIAL STIMULUS IN TWENTY TWENTY THE CARES ACT- MAY HAVE PREVENTED POVERTY FROM IMMEDIATELY INCREASING. THE DIRECT STIMULUS PAYMENTS WERE THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL TO THAT AND FOLLOWED BY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE EXPANSIONS. HOWEVER WITH IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES LAPSES IN SUPPORT AND GAPS IN ACCESS TO THOSE PROGRAMS AND OTHERS I WOULD EXPECT THAT WE'LL SEE AN INCREASE IN POVERTY WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON TWENTY TWENTY OVERALL. ESPECIALLY WITHIN CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED. FOURTH AND FINALLY POLICY DECISIONS THIS YEAR WILL HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR NEAR TERM WELL BEING AND I HOPE ALSO FOR LONG TERM WELL BEING. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT SIGNED BY PRESIDENT BY THEN EXTENDS MANY PROVISIONS THEIR RESEARCH BELIEVES WERE EFFECTIVE DURING THE PAST YEAR AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. IT ALSO EXPANDS SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ON AND ON A GREAT NEW SCALE THROUGH FULLY REFUNDABLE TAX CREDITS. NATIONWIDE ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT THIS PACKAGE TOGETHER COULD CUT CHILD POVERTY AND HALF. AN ARE ROUGH ESTIMATES FROM THE CALIFORNIA POVERTY MEASURE SUGGESTS A SLIGHTLY SMALLER BUT SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON IN THE STATE FOR THOSE CHILD TAX CREDITS ALONE. AND IF THEY'RE EXTENDED BEYOND THIS YEAR IT COULD REALLY BE A GAME CHANGER FOR CHILD POVERTY. THERE IS STRONG CONSENSUS IN THE RESEARCH LITERATURE ABOUT LARGE SCALE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE CASH AND CASH LIKE BENEFITS CAN EFFECTIVELY REVERSE DETRIMENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF MATERIAL NEED THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS FACE. TWO OBSERVATIONS MAY HELP I THINK PUT THIS CHILD TAX CREDIT IN PERSPECTIVE CONSIDERING THAT YOU'RE HEARING IS TALKING ABOUT OTHER PROGRAMS RELATED TO THAT TODAY AND I'LL AND ON THIS POINT. FIRST AS CURRENTLY DESIGNED THESE TRACK CREDITS ARE UNLIKELY TO DISCOURAGE FAMILIES FROM WORKING A COMMONLY. RAISED CONCERNS OR IN MY VIEW NOT IN IN AGGREGATE OUT WITH BENEFITS. SECOND TACK CHILD TAX CREDITS ALONE WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO KEEP CHILD POVERTY AT BAY OR TO CUT IT IN HALF AS ASTON THAT SUGGESTS. IT MUST WORK TOGETHER WITH CALFRESH CAL WORKS IN OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ALL TOGETHER AS A PACKAGE AT THE SCALE THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY TALKING ABOUT AND EFFECTIVELY AND EQUITABLY REACH CALIFORNIANS IN NEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM S. C. HUTCH FULL. POLICY ANALYST AT THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. HELLO AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO EVERYONE MY NAME IS SB HUTCH FULL I AND I AM A POLICY ANALYST AT THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WHILE CALIFORNIA IS A WEALTHY ST HOME TO MANY HIGH INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GREATLY EXPANDS OUR WEALTH IN THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. BECAUSE OF POLICY BARRIERS AND GENDER AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY MANY CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR WOMEN AND IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN BLOCKED FROM ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THESE CALIFORNIANS FACE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP EARNING LOW WAGES THAT SIMPLY DID NOT MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. SECOND COBIT NINETEEN TOOK THIS BAD SITUATION AND IT MADE IT EVEN WORSE WIDENING RACIAL AND GENDER INEQUITIES. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE JOBS STILL GONE ARE IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS THE PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN AND IMMIGRANTS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY EMPLOYED. LEADING THEM TO SEEK NOTABLY HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS. BECAUSE THESE INDUSTRIES WERE MOSTLY LOW PAYING. THIS RECESSION ALSO MEANS THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL OUT OF WORK WEREN'T EARNING MUCH BEFORE THIS CRISIS AND ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE SAVINGS TO FALL BACK ON IF THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH PUBLIC SUPPORT BEFORE THEY CAN FIND WORK AGAIN. THIS WILL LIKELY BE A LONG TERM CONCERN BEYOND THE PANDEMIC. AS IT WILL LIKELY TAKE TIME TO RECOVER ALL OF THE JOBS LOST. LOST JOBS AND EARNINGS HAVE STRETCHED CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS. INOUR STATE ALMOST TWO MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN ABOUT FIFTEEN POINT 9% REPORTED SOMETIMES OR OFTEN NOT HAVING ENOUGH FOOD TO EAT DURING A FOUR WEEK PERIOD I IN LATE JUNE AND JULY. THIS INCLUDES MORE THAN ONE IN FIVE WITH YOU NEXT HOUSEHOLDS AND BLACK HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN. ALSO REPORTING SOMETIMES OR OFTEN JUST NOT HAVING ENOUGH FOOD TO EAT. THIRD WHILE THE FEDERAL RELIEF PACKAGE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY HELP REDUCE POVERTY ESTARá BONE HAS ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED WE STILL REQUIRE A SAFETY NET THAT IS ACCESSIBLE ROBUST AND THAT PROVIDE ON GOING SUPPORT BEYOND THE PANDEMIC. EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN WILL EXPIRE IN EARLY SEPTEMBER AND IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT EVERYONE WHO'S LOST JOBS WE'LL FIND WILL HAVE FOUND EMPLOYMENT BY THEN. SO SIMPLIFYING ACCESS TO THE SAFETY NET NOW. BECAUSE FEDERAL RELIEF COULD RUN OUT AT A TIME WHEN MANY PEOPLE STILL NEED HELP. THE STATE SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE EXCLUDED FROM FEDERAL SUPPORT DUE TO THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. SUCH AS THROUGH EXPANDING THE CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND PROVIDING DIRECT CASH AID SUCH AS BROUGH ARE PERHAPS ANOTHER GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS. FINALLY AFTER THE PANDEMIC WE SHOULD LOOK BEYOND JUST RECOVERY TO CONSIDERING HOW OUR SAFETY NET CAN BE RESTRUCTURED TO MEET THE REAL MEAT. AND CAL WORKS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE CURRENT MAXIMUM EIGHT PAYMENT A TYPICAL FAMILY OF THREE WITH NO OTHER INCOME BUT ALSO RECEIVE THE FULL CALFRESH ALLOWANCE WOULD STILL LIVE BELOW THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF PROPERTY. THIS IS CONSPICUOUSLY CONCERNING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL DEFINITION DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR IT WILL REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER HOUSING COSTS WHICH HELPED DRIVE POVERTY IN OUR STATE. A ROBUST SAFETY NET WILL HELP CREATE A CALIFORNIA WHERE EVERYONE CAN THRIVE. IN CLOSING TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIANS AND THE LEVY A HARDSHIP STATE POLICYMAKERS SHOULD SHORE UP OUR SAFETY NET TARGET INEQUITIES AND FILL IN THE GAPS IN THE FEDERAL RESPONSE. SO THE CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM- KIM JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES DIRECTOR JOHNSON. THANK YOU CHAIR IN MEMBERS CAN JOHNSON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON I'LL START WITH- THE CALFRESH CASELOAD IN WHEN THEY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS MADE OUT WITH THE SPEAKERS PRIOR IN TERMS OF THE IMPORTANCE. OF THIS CRITICAL FOOD SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE CALFRESH CASELOAD REACHED AN ALL TIME HIGH THE MONTH OF JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY REACHING TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE A MILLION HOUSEHOLDS OR FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION INDIVIDUALS. AGAIN THAT IS THE HIGHEST IN PROGRAM HISTORY TOWARDS THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY WE DID SEE SOME DECLINE IN IN CASELOAD- BUT WE WILL LET YOU KNOW THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THIS YEAR WE ARE SEEING SOME MINOR BUT PROMISING CASELOAD INCREASES. IN TERMS OF REACH IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY. SOME OF THE REASONS RELATED TO A CASELOAD NOT BEING EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT IT TO BE WERE SOME INVESTMENTS IN FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT EXPANDED AND EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS. AND THOSE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY. UNTIL RECENTLY ALL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WERE CONSIDERED INCOME FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY. WHILE YOU AYE BENEFITS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL TO THE STATE'S PANDEMIC RESPONSE THE FEDERAL POLICY DECISION TO INCLUDE ALL OF THOSE BENEFITS. I CERTAINLY HAVE AN IMPACT. MORE RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN AN EXCLUSION OF PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION OR P. YOU SEE WHICH IS CURRENTLY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WEEK. AND ALSO AN EXPANSION OF HOUSE OF COLLEGE STUDENT ELIGIBILITY FOR CATHOLICS WE EXPECT THESE TWO CHANGES TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE CALFRESH CASELOAD. I'M IN AND THAT CHANGES WE'VE SEEN SO FAR ARE AN INDICATOR OF THAT. FEDERAL POLICY CHANGES ARE SET TO CONTINUE TO THE LENGTH OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY INCLUDING THE ALLOTMENTS THE ADDITIONAL LOT MEANS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE TO YOU CALFRESH RECIPIENTS. THE RECENT CONGRESSIONAL ACTIONS- ALSO EXTEND THE 15% BENEFIT THROUGH THE END OF THE FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR SO GREAT AT EFFORTS IN ON THOSE SPACES. I WE ARE CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS IN TERMS OF TARGETED OUTREACH FOR NEWLY ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS WE'VE HAD SOME NEW PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN DEALT DEVELOPED WITH THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND THEIR DEPARTMENTS. AROUND OUT REACHING TO THOSE. EFFORT AS WE LOOK TO EXPAND OUTREACH FOR ADDITIONAL POPULATIONS. IN A RELATIONSHIP TO QUESTIONS RELATED TO FOOD BANKS I WANT TO AGAIN APPRECIATE THE TREMENDOUS EFFORTS OF FOOD BANKS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IN THE END THAT AGAIN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION PROVIDING A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL INCLUDING A RESOURCES AND BENEFITS FOR DIAPERS. SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. INTO OF JAZZ BLUES LOW CALIFORNIA FOOD BEING UP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCEPT THE FIVE AND MIL DOLLARS WORTH OF STATE FUNDED FOOD BOXES IN EACH MONTH OF THE PANDEMIC AS AN EXAMPLE LAST MONTH. OUR INTERMEDIARY CALHOUN'S LOGISTICS DELIVERED OFF NEARLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BOXESOF FOOD WORTH APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THE STATE FOOD BOXES HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE RESPONSE. ACROSS THE STATE. I ALSO WANT TO THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE THROUGH THOSE THESE BOXES IN THE STATE DISTRIBUTION TO REACH. THAT OR OTHERWISE NOT CONNECTED OR POTENTIALLY HAVE A LOCAL FOOD BANK THAT'S TOO FAR AWAY SO WE HAVE INCLUDED TRIBES IN THE DISTRIBUTION. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE COSTS OF ALL OF THE FOOD BANKS HAVE SKYROCKETED IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN IMPACTED BY THE VOLUNTEERS. ARE THAT THEY RELY ON IN THE WAREHOUSES AT TO MANAGE THE DISTRIBUTIONS AND COMMUNITIES SO WE APPRECIATE. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADD BONDS HERE AS THE PRIVATELY BANKS AND ALSO SUPPORT OUT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD HE'S BEEN PARTNERING AS WELL. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE MOVING FORWARD WE KNOW THAT FROM PREVIOUS ECONOMIC CYCLES THE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND WELL BEING OF PEOPLE WHO ARE FOOD INSECURE REMAINS IMPACTING. LONG AFTER THE REST OF THE ECONOMY STARTS TO STABILIZE TO BE SEEN THAT NEED. REMAIN I WANTED YEARS RESET IN DISASTERS THE PAST AGAIN LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCE. HEADING INTO BUDGET YEAR AT TO SUPPORT THIS TREMENDOUS PART OF OUR OVERALL FOOD DELIVERY SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THOSE IN NEED. IN TERMS OF THE LAST QUESTION RELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF HOW WORKS- IN WHAT WORKS THE WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING SEEING. OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OUR FAMILY ENGAGEMENT EMPOWERMENT DIVISION JENNIFER HERNANDEZ WILL FOLLOW ME THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE CASE LOAD CHANGES OF COURSE- THE- ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN ABLE TO MAXIMIZE AND LEVERAGE TO SUPPORT FAMILIES EVEN JUST THIS WEEK. WE ARE AT WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL ACTIONS AS SEEING INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE SOME SUPPORT- IN RECOVERY AT JUST EVEN THIS WEEK GIVING THOSE RESOURCES IN THE HANDS OF MANY SO. SOME OF THAT RELIEF HAS A B. AND THEN HAVE AN IMPACT ON ELIGIBILITY. FOR PROGRAMS LIKE HOW IT WORKS BUT WE AGAIN RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE AGAIN SPEAKERS BEFORE ME AB THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF HOW WORKS AS ONE IF THE ARRAY. OF STATE TO GET PROGRAMS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING FAMILIES EXPERIENCING POVERTY THIS DEFENSE AND THIS LAST YEAR HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY AND LIKE NO OTHER SO AGAIN. WE WILL LOOK AHEAD TO- IN TERMS OF NEEDING CASELOAD AND HOW IT CAN WORK CONNECTING. ADD TO IT TO RESPONSE. TO THE FULL ARRAY MAKES SUCH A- TO BE ABLE TO THAT SET. UP THROUGH EACH. WITH WORKS WITH HEALTH. MAY CALYX ADDRESS. AND WITHOUT ALL. THERE THANK YOU. THANK DIRECTOR NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JENNA HER NAME. OF WITH THE FAMILY ENGAGED AND- DIVISION- IS THE DEPUTY TO OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU- CHAIR CHAIR. SO THE AFTERNOON I LIKE TO TALK ALL THREE POINTS- THE FOR QUESTION THAT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS IS THIS ISSUE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF DECLINE IN THE- BURKE TOLD CASE- ALONG WITH. TO REASON- FOR WHY WE'RE SEEING OTHER NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXETER OUR PROGRAM AND WE NORMALLY EXPERIENCE- IN TERMS THE K. DECLINE DO US OF HONE IN ON A FEW KEY EXAM- FOR INSTANCE NEW OP. EYES DRY JOHN MEN- THE XP OF THE- OF ON. BENEFITS ESSENTIALLY MADE MANY FAMILIES AN ELIGIBLE FOR OUR PROGRAM RIGHT AND SO THAT WAS A KEY FACTOR POTENTIALLY IN MY NEW APPLICANTS WERE UNABLE TO ACCESS OUR PROGRAM IN ADDITION TO THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION. THE OTHER PIECE IS THAT- IN SORT OF HEARING AND CHECKING IN WITH OUR OTHER STATE PARTNERS WE HAVE HEARD AND LEARNED THAT- OTHERS. HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR SITUATIONS- NOT ONLY ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE BUT ALSO ON THE TRIBAL TENNIS SIDE- WHERE THEY'VE SEEN SIMILAR DECLINES- IN COLORADO AND MASSACHUSETTS THE RECENTLY SHARED WITH US- THAT THEY SAW A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA- BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM STATES SUCH AS NEVADA. THAT HAVE GONE. THE OTHER DIRECTION RIGHT- WHERE IN ABOUT IT THEY HAVE EXCLUDED ALL- UNEMPLOYMENT INCOME- FROM FROM ELIGIBILITY- I WILL FLAG. THE AND INCOME IS A FEDERAL INCOME. FOR TNF AND- BUT THAT IS AT THE DISCRETION OF STATES IN TERMS OF THE TREATMENT- ANOTHER FACTOR THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT IS IN TERMS OF THE ISSUE OF DISCONTINUING SAYS- AS YOU MAY RECALL IN IN THE AT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. WE DID WAIVE- THE PROCESSING OF WORKS DETERMINE- DURING THE SPRING RIGHT AND WHAT THAT CENTRAL DID A KICK THE CAMP FOR- SERVERS. IN AN- IN DISK. SAYS IN THE FALL OF LAST YEAR AND SO- WHAT WE THE DAY THOUGH IS THAT. THAT THREE MY PEAK OF DE. IS THAT WE SAW IN THE FALL. OUR DECEMBER DAY SHOW THAT DISK. IS HAD ACTUALLY DROPPED BY TO WHAT WE WERE. SEEN ON WITH OUR CASE- SO. THAT'S A TRYING TO SEE- IT COULD BE SHOWING- THAT THERE IS A NATURAL DECLINE IN PLACE LOAD THAT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED- PRETEND SOONER. WHAT THAT THREE MONTHS OF DISCONTINUING IS- AND POSITING THAT THIS R. SEVEN- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE IMPORTANT PIECES THAT FAMILIES WERE POTENTIALLY ABLE TO STAY ON LONGER- AND THAT THE POLICY- PUSHING OUT THAT DISCONTINUANCE OF THE FALL WAS- RESULTED IN AND NOT BENEFIT. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO HIGHLIGHT- ANOTHER PIECE THAT I SAY THAT- DO CAN TO- WE OUR TOWN WELFARE. WITH SOME. TO REALLY LOOK AT LOOK AT THE DAY. IN GREEDY. TO I DON'T ANY OTHER P. CALL- ANY PREVENTATIVE MEASURES THAT WE MAY TAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE ARE CONTINUING T RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS- WE HAVE- AS YOU MAY RECALL IT IN ANOTHER CONVERSATION. OUTLINED A SERIES OF WEAVERS EVERY IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CLIENTS WERE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR BENEFITS AND THAT. THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT HAVING TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN THE OFFICES- AND SO THAT WAS CERTAINLY AYE AYE KEY FACTOR- ANOTHER FLAG THAT I WOULD POINT OUT THERE DIRECTOR JOHNSON ALLUDED TO. IS THAT MOST RECENTLY- WE HAVE AGAIN- DISCONTINUE COUNTY INTO THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYED COMPENSATION- FOR NEW APPLICANTS AND THAT. IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL THE IMPACT- BUT KNOWING THE IMPACT UNEMPLOYMENT INCOME HAS HAD ON FOLKS- IT WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE SOME POSITIVE OUTCOMES FROM THAT. ON THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WOULD SAY IS WE HAVE STARTED TO WORK ON IMPLEMENTATION. OF THAT THE GOLDEN STATE GRANT AND SO OF THOSE ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS WILL AGAIN HELP FAMILIES- DURING THESE THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. MOVING ON TO OTHER PART THAT WERE IN AGENDA- ANOTHER P. OF ADVICE TO ADDRESS SORT OF HOW WE INTO TO AND OUR RATES OF- OF L. AND OUT REACH FAMILIES AND TO PER. CASE ACCESS. AND SO ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WERE LOOKING AT JOIN AND HOPPING JOINED IS OUR EACH AND REALLY BECAUSE- GIVEN THE NEW CASELOAD ON GIVEN THE CHALLENGING TIMES UNDER THAT ARE BOTH. I CAN- MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE RESOURCES IS CRITICAL BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO REDUCE THE STIGMA RIGHT AND SO FRAME MEAN- OUR BENEFITS ARE PROGRAMS IN SUCH A WAY THAT REALLY EMPHASIZE ON THAT. EDUCATIONAL AND JOB TRAINING SKILL DEVELOPMENT- SUPPORT IS GOING TO BE REALLY QUICK CRITICAL THE OTHER PIECE IS- WE OFFER MANY SUPPORTIVE SERVICES SUCH AS CHILDCARE RIGHT. AND SO ENSURING THAT FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT- ENTRY MENTOR PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR CAN ALSO- HELP LAND- THOSE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IS GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL TO ENSURING. THAT WE DO AWAY WITH THAT STIGMA- IN TERMS OF DECREASING EXITS AGAIN ENSURING THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR OUR ADVOCATES AND OTHER COUNTY PARTNERS. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE CLEARLY IDENTIFYING WHAT THOSE KEY REASONS ARE AND ENSURING THAT WE CAN BE PROACTIVE ABOUT REACHING OUT TO OUR CLIENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN RIGHT THAT THEY'VE NEVER DROPPED OFF. AND IF THEY DO- PERHAPS- DIG INTO THOSE FACTORS AND I'M NOT AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE ALSO EXPLORING WAYS TO PERHAPS DO EXIT SURVEYS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REASONS ARE. BEHIND FOLKS DROPPING OFF. AND THEN AND LASTLY I'D LIKE TO TOPPLE THE ISSUE OF- IT WAS POSE IN THE AGENDA AROUND- ENROLLMENT AND WHAT. WHAT WHAT DO. WHAT WE USED TO TRY TO PREDICT- OUR CASELOAD. AND SO- IN IN OUR P. CASE LOAD US TO WE DO USE A- TIME SERIES. METHODS IN PREDICTING CASELOAD- HOWEVER WHAT FOUND IS THAT- EARLY IN THE- WEEKS. ANY IN OUR CASE LOW. OTHER METHODS ON TO HELP US WITHOUT FORECASTING- INCLUDING- OTHER VARIABLES SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES. FORECAST ON UNEMPLOYMENT RATES- CIVILIAN LABOR FORCE AND CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AND SO- AGAIN TODAY THE BASE CASE LOAD WILL INCLUDE AN ESTIMATED IMPACT FROM THIS NEW. POLICY SHIFT THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE EXCLUSION OF PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION- AND SO AGAIN THAT WAS ONLY IN EFFECT AS OF FEBRUARY SO TOO SOON TO TELL- BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE AN IMPACT AND- IN WITHOUT I WILL END WITH APPRECIATION FOR THE TIME TO. TO UPDATE YOU ON SOME OF OUR OUR WORK AND HOW IT WORKS- IN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO WORK WITH THAT WITH YOUR STAFF IN OUR COUNTY AND- STAKEHOLDER- PARTNERS IN IDENTIFYING THESE. CHALLENGES THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS FACING AND HELPING A TOPPLED WITH SOLUTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DAVID KILGOUR DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU MY NAME IS DEREK OVER MCGREGOR THEIR PARTNER CHILDBIRTH SERVICES IN JUMPING INTO THE QUESTIONS ASKED IN THE GENDER THE FIRST HOUSTON AROUND THE BUDGET FOR THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM HE'S JUST A SICK EXPECTS THE USE OF THESE FUNDS TO INCREASE STAFFING LEVELS ARE REDUCED BY THE EFFECTS OF THE RESULTS OF COMMON REDUCTIONS. RAINEY'S COUNTY SPONSORED FUNDING METHODOLOGY THIS INCREASE IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT IRECTION LC STAYS WE USE THESE POSITIONS THE STATE MY SERVICES. IN FOCUS ON THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF THE FAMILIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC FAMILIES THAT NEED THEIR ORDERS REVIEW TO MODIFIED OR TEMPORARY CAN PROCESS ORDERS HAVE BEEN CONTINUED FOR REVALUATION IN FINALS FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE PARENTS ARE EVER CHANGING. AS CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY RECOVERS. ON THE- EFFECTS OF THE IN COUNTY COMPARED THE CURRENT. YEAR TWENTY FOUR ONE. TWENTY LEVELS USING THE LC STATE FUNDING METHODOLOGY LC STATEMENT EVEN A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND- SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. TO COME INTO LINE WITH THE FUNDING FORMULA. FIFTY SIX MILLION OF THAT IS STATE JOURNAL FINE AND THEN THERE'S A TWO TO ONE MATCH. OF A HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE UP THAT HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION. AND THERE IS A NOTE HERE THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT BASED ON THE NEED TO PROPOSALS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED SO- EDITION OF MONEY AND. TRANSFER PROGRAM WHICH WOULD. SIX IN IN. FOR THAT PARITY. NOW AND I WOULD. NOTE HERE. THE THIS PAST. CHANNEL CAPTURES WE AND JUST. A FEW YEARS BACK. AND STEPPING CONSTANCE ARE BEEN NON PROBABLY EVER IN. A BIT. IN NEED TO REVISE WHAT THAT NUMBERS LOOK LIKE MOVING FOR. A PIECE OF OUR PROPOSAL HERE SON AND- THE- COLLECTIVE STAY AND CALGARY CHILD KILEY ARE SET BY STEP. INCLUDED DEFINITELY BY LEDGER ON IN RECOMMEND CHANGES TO CHILD SUPPORT. AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THIS THIS STUDY WILL HELP INFORM WILL. AGENCY AND LEGISLATORS ON WHAT THOSE ACTIONS MIGHT NEED TO BE. ONCE HE NOW SAYS ORTION OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT IS COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION OF CHANGES IS POSSIBLE ONLY WITH THE LIMITATIONS. WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS SET RECORDS STATUTES SO THEREFORE AIN'T STAGERS INVOLVEMENT WILL BE HELPFUL IN ADVANCING IMPLEMENTATION UNNECESSARY CHANGES. TO THE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. I'M ESTHER. CONCERN OF THIS PARTICULAR.

ROLES DO PROHIBIT THOUGH- CONTRACT SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL YOUR PROCESS IS COMPLETED DECSS CAN PROVIDE A SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO A LEGISLATURE ONCE IT'S RELEASED. IN THE INTERIM PEACE ASSESSMENT RIGHT UNLESS THERE IS A STATE THAT MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE SOLICITATION I WOULD SAY HERE THAT THIS STUDY IS GREATER THAN THAT JUST A CONVERSATION ABOUT COMPLEMENT THE WORST PROGRAM. AND THERE WAS A STEADY TWO THOUSAND THREE ON COLLECTIBILITY OF THE ENTIRETY OF THE RACE BALOCHS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO LOOK FOR TO- MOVING FORWARD IS- COLLECTIBILITY OF ALL THE ARREARS EIGHTEEN BILLION THAT'S SITTING OUT THERE. IN IN HOW THAT BREAKS DOWN COPAS. CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A PIECE OF THAT. DOES IT QUITE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM HWANG CHIEF STEP DIRECTOR FOR THE ALL OFFICE FOR SO. IN A. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS BRIAN WONG CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK TODAY- I WOULD LOOK FIRST LIKE TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE ROLE OF AUTOMATION SYSTEMS. OUR ACCESS BEFORE IN IN THE PANDEMIC. AUTOMATION SYSTEMS ARE MAINTAINED OVERALL CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE BOTH BEFORE AND IN THE PANDEMIC. KELSO SYSTEM MADE CHANGES TO COMPLY WITH EXECUTIVE ORDERS PROVIDE MERCY RELIEF AND BENEFITS TO BENEFICIARIES IMPACTED BY THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES. THANK OPEN NINETY. THIS INCLUDES PROACTIVELY PREVENTING NEGATIVE ACTIONS AND PROTECTING MEDICARE CASES FROM PART OF DISCONTINUATION FOR CALIFORNIANS UNDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. ADDITIONALLY THE MODERNIZED ONLINE CAL WORKS APPRAISAL TOOL WAS IMPLEMENTED TO STREAMLINE THE WELFARE TO WORK APPRAISAL PROCESS FOR ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. THE INCREASE BETWEEN THE NEW VOCAB AND SALAS IS A REAL TIME. WHICH ENABLES IMMEDIATE EXCHANGE OF CASE INFORMATION MINIMIZES DUPLICATIVE ENTRY AND STREAMLINES THE WORKFLOW ACROSS CAL WORKS AND WELFARE TO WORK CASE WORKS. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC OF THE CALIFORNIA EBT SYSTEM PROVIDED OVER TWO MILLION RECIPIENTS WITH ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO FOOD AND CASH ASSISTANCE BENEFITS USING MAGNETIC STRIPE CARDS THAT WE SELL TERMINALS AND AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES. THE PANDEMIC RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY AND ANXIETY FOR CALIFORNIA FOOD AND CASH RECIPIENTS. ONCE THE REACHING PROJECT IMPLEMENTED TO PROGRAMS ONLINE PURCHASING AND PANDEMIC EDT CAN YOU CHECK. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC RECIPIENTS ONLY OPTION WAS TO VISIT A GROCER OR RETAILER. IT TWENTY TWENTY ALSO I ALONG WITH OUR SPONSOR DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES IMPLEMENTED ONLINE PURCHASING WITHIN A MONTH DUE TO THE IN PERSON NEEDS OF THE PANDEMIC. AND THE MANDATORY SHELTER IN PLACE REQUIREMENTS FOR CALIFORNIANS. ALL MY PURCHASING ENABLE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO PURCHASE GROCERIES ONLINE USING THEIR EBT CARD AT AMAZON AND WALMART. AND FAMILIES WERE ALSO ABLE TO USE CASH BENEFITS TO MAKE PURCHASES ONLINE AT WALMART. AS OF MARCH SEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE HAVE BEEN OVER SIX POINT ONE MILLION TRANSACTIONS.

IN REGARDS TO THE QUESTION- MCCARTY SAID SHORT MEDIUM AND LONG TERM. OPPORTUNITIES THAT FACILITATE ACCESS. BOTH SIDES WELLS OUR PARTY DEPARTMENTS WIND WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY ARE CONSTANTLY REVIEWING AND EVALUATING IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD HELP FACILITATE ACCESS FOR ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS THAT ARE UNDERSERVED. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE CHAO SAUCIER FOR UNIFIED BENEFITS CAL PORTAL THAT WILL REPLACE THE LEGACY FOR ALL APPLICATIONS. THE BENEFITS CAL BOTTLED BEVERAGES FOLKS ON USER CENTERED DESIGN AND MAKING THE NEW PUBLIC FACING CORPS GET PATIENT CUSTOMER FOCUSED ON THE LIBEL.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK DIRECTLY. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM BRIAN BOSTON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO BUILD OFF OF WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID INTERESTING QUESTION. UNDER WOULD LIKE TO. IT'S NOT THE BIG PICTURE GENERALLY WHEN WE SEE AN INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT AS WE DID LAST SPRING WE SEE A NOTABLE AND CONTINUED INCREASE IN CASE LOAD FOR OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS INCLUDING HEALTH QUESTION CALPERS. THIS LAST YEAR HAS BEEN IN THE- TO. BECAUSE OF HOW IT WORKS IT'S BEEN MOVED SINCE OUR SERVICE A FAMILY OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND LOW INCOME CHILDREN THAT IS BOTH THE LOWEST CASELOAD NUMBER AND THE HISTORY OF THE PROGRAM AND REPRESENTS THE FASTEST DECLINE IN CASE THOUGH THAT WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND FEWER CHILDREN THAN WE SERVED. A YEAR PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC FOR EXAMPLE NOW THE QUESTION IS OF COURSE WHY ARE WE SAYING KISSEL AND DECREASES WHY IS THIS TIME DIFFERENT THAN PREVIOUS RECESSIONS AND GENERALLY WE THINK THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO THAT. PRESS FACTORS INTO THREE THE POCKETS. ONE OF OUR THAT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THEMSELVES ARE DIFFERENT OR MAYBE DIFFERENT. IN THIS CURRENT RECESSION FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT- IN THE DATA. THAT WAY ELSE IN THIS RECESSION OF DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED WORKERS WITHOUT CHILDREN OR DIGITAL AND ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CAL WORKS ASSISTANCE. ANOTHER BUCKET OF REASONS IS THE ECONOMIC RELIEF THAT HAS BEEN ALL. FOR IT BY STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS THIS IS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED- ADDITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS HELP THEIR DIRECT STIMULUS CHECKS ALSO EFFORTS SUCH AS- THE INFECTION MORATORIUM ALL OF THESE EFFORTS MAY HAVE REDUCED DEMAND. FOR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. ABOUT FINAL REASON IS PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES AND CONCERNS THEMSELVES I'M GONNA SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME ON THIS NOT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR BUT BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS A FACTOR SUGGEST SOME POTENTIAL. POLICY OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE. SO ONE THING KNOW ABOUT PROGRAM SUCH AS CAL WORKS IS THAT THEY TEND TO- POSE A LARGE PAPERWORK BURDEN ON APPLICANTS AND- EXISTING RECIPIENTS- APPLICATIONS CAN BE DIFFICULT. ONCE ENROLLED A FAMILY HAS TO SAY RECERTIFICATION PAPERWORK AT LEAST EVERY SIX MONTHS. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FRICTION OF BOTH OF THOSE POINTS- SINCE THE PANDEMIC WE'VE SEEN THAT THE NUMBER OF DENIALS ON APPLICATIONS OF INCREASED WITH THE MOST COMMON. REASON FOR DENIALS AND IT COULD WORK ERRORS. WE HAVE SEEN AT LEAST A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN CASES EXITING WITH THE MOST COMMON REASON BEING CONNECTED TO. RESEARCH PAVE IT BEING EITHER INCOMPLETELY OR INCORRECTLY FILLED OUT. WE ARE ALSO SEE RYAN WE'RE HAVING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES- WITH YOUR FEET I MAY ASK YOU TO TURN YOUR VIDEO OFF IF THAT'S OKAY JUST SO THAT WE CAN- GET THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR COMMENTS. OF COURSE LET ME TRY THIS AUDIO ONLY SEE IF THAT WORKS BETTER- SO- SO- AS AS BEEN MENTIONED BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS WHILE WE DID SEE A TEMPORARY INCREASE AND I'D CASES ACCIDENT- IN THE MOST RECENT DATA IN DECEMBER WE DID SEE THAT EXIT RATE COME DOWN SOMEWHAT BUT ANOTHER THING THAT WE SAW IN DECEMBER WAS THAT THE NUMBER OF. GENES FOR RESTORATION THESE ARE CASES OF FAMILIES WHO WERE DISCONTINUED IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS WERE ASKING TO BE REINSTATED HAS ALSO INCREASED AND THAT'S NOT AT HISTORIC HIGH THE SUGGESTS THAT MANY OF THOSE CASES THAT WERE DISCONTINUED IN THE MONTHS WHEN THE CASE PHONE WAS CASELOAD EXIT RATE WAS HISTORICALLY HIGH WE'RE STILL FOLKS THAT. REQUIRED WILL. A DESIRE ASSISTANCE IN SOME WAYS. WELL ALL OF THIS TO US SUGGEST THAT THERE MAYBE- SOME FRICTION IN TERMS OF COMPLETING PAPERWORK AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS CONDITION WHERE- APPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS. ARE EITHER UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO COME TO A PHYSICAL COUNTY OFFICE WHERE THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE STAFF ASSISTANCE IN COMPLETING THESE PAPERWORK- AGAIN WE EMPHASIZE THIS NOT BECAUSE WE KNOW IT IS THE MAJOR OR EVEN A MAJOR CONCERN BUT BECAUSE AND SUGGEST SOME POLICY OPTIONS. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IN THE SPRING WE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED RE DETERMINATIONS FOR THE COW WORKS PROGRAM AND THIS RESULTED IN A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN CASE LOAD CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT GIVEN THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY AT THAT TIME. WELL ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE OF SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND REINSTATING THAT SUSPENSION WHAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE SOME OPTIONS TO. AGAIN SUSPEND RE DETERMINATIONS THROUGH THE LIFE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THE QUESTIONS. ASK ABOUT THE AFFECT OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS THIS HAS BEEN ADDRESSED TO SOME EXTENT BY. PREVIOUS SPEAKERS- WE WILL NOT THAT- EVEN IN EIGHT TRADITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT WILL TYPICALLY RENTER FAMILIES INCOME AND ELIGIBLE FOR CAL WORK SO THIS IS BEFORE ANY ADD ONS THAT WERE INCLUDED. IN RECENT FEDERAL MEASURES. ALSO MANY CAL WORKS FAMILIESHAVE. A TENUOUS CONNECTIONS TO LABOR MARKET MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THOSE. ARE PROBABLY UNLIKELY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BUT THERE'S SOME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS A FACTOR. YES LEE AND SOME APPLICANTS BEING DENIED AND- THE LEGISLATURE RECENTLY AND IT'S EARLY ACTION PACKAGE AND COVERT EXEMPTED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. THE ADDITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FROM COUNTING AGAINST INCOME ELIGIBILITY SO WE THINK THAT WILL ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THERE. FINALLY THE QUESTIONS ASK ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S CASH- I'LL SAY THAT SOME OF. MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS APPLY TO THE CONFERENCE CASELOAD WE HAVE SEEN A DECLINE SINCE AS THE DIRECTOR NOTED WE DID SEE. I. P. N. CALFRESH CASELOAD- EARLY LAST SUMMER. WE'VE SINCE SEEN A DECLINE. THE CASE HOWEVER ABOVE ITS PRE PANDEMIC LEVEL AND- AS HAS BEEN NOTED THERE'S BEEN SOME CHANGES ON THE FEDERAL SIDE WHICH WE REASONABLY EXPECT WILL RESULT IN. A CASELOAD INCREASES DOWN THE LINE. AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT HOW FRESH IS THAT MOST OF THE RELEVANT POLICY SET AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO LEGISLATORS DISCRETION THERE IS A LOT MORE DETAILED THAN IT IS FOR OUR X. I BELIEVE THAT ADDRESSES THE QUESTIONS OVER PERFORMANCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JACKIE BOTTLE SO YOU'LL- LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HI JACKIE BUT ON ZERO FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE- STARTING OFF WITH THE FIRST QUESTION IN YOUR AGENDA- BETWEENFEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN AND FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TRANSPORT CASELOAD HAS DECLINED STATEWIDE BY 4% FROM ONE POINT ONE THREE MILLION TO ONE POINT ZERO NINE MILLION AND THIS IS LIKELY DUE TO DECLINING CASELOAD IN CAL WORKS WHICH SERVES AS THE PRIMARY CASELOAD PIPELINE INTO THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM. DESPITE THE DECLINING CASELOAD COLLECTIONS OF ACTUALLY SPIKED FROM TWO POINT FIVE BILLION TO TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD WHICH REFLECTS A 12% INCREASE. IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SPIKE IS LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO INTERCEPTIONS OF KERR'S ACT FEDERAL STIMULUS PAYMENTS AND THE INTERCEPTION UP BASE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. DIES WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS COLLECTION SPIKE IS LIKELY NOT INDICATIVE OF BASELINE PROGRAM TRENDS. MOVING ON TO THE SECOND QUESTION REGARDING OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPOSED STUDIES. ON THE COMPROMISE OF A RICH PROGRAM AND THE K. FACTOR WHICH IS THE SHARE OF INCOME FAMILY SPENT ON CHILDREN- WE FOUND THAT THERE ALREADY ARE EXISTING STUDIES BUT THE STATE COULD PULL FROM. TO INFORM POSSIBLE PROGRAM CHANGES FOR EXAMPLE A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS SOME AT THE REQUEST OF THE STATE AN EFFORT TO UPDATE THE K. FACTOR. THE MOST- RECENT STATE REPORT ON THE CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINE NOTED THAT THE REASON WHY THE STUDIES MAY NOT HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IS BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO COMPARE THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH STUDY IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SELECT ONE STUDY OVER THE OTHER. BUT ALSO- THERE THERE ARE PROCEEDS CHALLENGES OF KEEPING POLITICS OUT OF THE ULTIMATE DECISION WITH THAT SAID WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON. THESE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THE STRUCTURES OF THE STUDIES TO ENSURE THAT ONE THEY'RE NOT DUPLICATIVE OF PAST RESEARCH AND TO THEY ACTUALLY WILL HELP OVERCOME THE BARRIERS. THAT HAVE PREVENTED CHANGES THUS FAR. WHAT THAT SAID- WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WAYS TO MAXIMIZE THE INFORMATION- THAT CAN COME FROM THE STUDIES. FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD REACH REQUEST THAT THE COLLECTABILITY STE- STUDY ASSESSED AND EQUITABLE EFFECTIVE DATE ON CERTAIN SUBGROUPS LIKE RACIAL MINORITIES. AND BE PERSON CENTERED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATURE MAY REQUEST THAT THE STUDY ASSESS THE BENEFITS AND TRADE OFFS- I'M SPECIFIC POLICY INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS NOT COLLECTING INTEREST ON GOVERNMENT OWED ARREARS- OR ENDING ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ON CASES DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN PAST LEGISLATIVE BILLS. THAT WERE ULTIMATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. I'M IN THE LEGISLATURE JUST MAY WANT TO KEEP IN MIND- HOW ANY ADDITIONS OR CHANGES TO THESE STUDIES JUST MAY IMPACT THE TIMING OF THE STUDIES AS WELL- BUT IF THE RESEARCH PROPOSAL I'M- AS THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONED CANNOT BE PROVIDED UNTIL THE END OF THE SOLICITATION PROCESS. THEN THE LEGISLATURE COULD LOOK AT HOW CURRENT PROGRAM UPDATES- THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED- AS A RESULT OF SRL PASSED LAST YEAR COULD SERVE AS A VEHICLE FOR CHECK INS- WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO BOTH GO OVER THE RESEARCH DESIGN AND SOLICIT LEGISLATIVE AND PART FOR THOSE STUDIES. MOVING ON TO THE THIRD QUESTION- I WOULD FLAG THAT AS WRITTEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE FINAL FINAL RULE THE STATE WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET AN EXTENSION FOR COMPLYING WITH THE FINAL FINAL RULE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS- AND THAT EXTENSION IS. TO SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO THIS MEANS THAT THE STATE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO COMPLY WITH MAJOR REMAINING COMPONENTS OF THE FEDERAL FINAL ROLES SUCH AS- CONSIDERING BASIC SUBSISTENCE NEEDS OF THE PAYING PARENT WHEN ESTABLISHING. CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS OR COMING UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT PRESUMED INCOME PRACTICE AND POSSIBLY EXPANDING CASE CLOSURE CRITERIA. AGAIN THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER HOW TO LEVERAGE THE CURRENTLY SCHEDULED SRL MEETINGS I'M TO AT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE UP TO DATE ON PROGRESS MADE SO FAR BUT THEN ALSO OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE CAN COMPLETE CAN PROVIDE IMPACT. AND WE WOULD ALSO FLAG THAT WHEN THE STATE IS IN THE POSITION TO ADOPT CHANGES RELATED TO THE FINAL FINAL RULE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THE BENEFITS AND TRADEOFFS. OF MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM CHANGES I'M THROUGH REGULATIONS VERSUS STATUTE. AS FOR THE LAST QUESTION BESIDES WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY FLAGGED- RELATED TO THE STUDIES AND THE FINAL FINAL ROLE WE WOULD ALSO I'M NO FOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT DURING COVERT NINETEEN THROUGH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THE STATE SUSPENDED THE REQUIREMENT THAT FEDERAL TAX REFUND INTERCEPT BE APPLIED TO GOVERNMENT OWED ARREARS. FIRST BEFORE FAMILY- BUT BEFORE BEING APPLIED TO- CHILD SUPPORT- TO FAMILIES. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER THE BENEFITS AND TRADE OFFS OF ALLOWING FEDERAL TAX REFUND INTERCEPT TO GO TO FAMILIES FIRST ON A PERMANENT BASIS I'M DURING THIS BUDGET CYCLE- AND WITH THAT AND THAT AND MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MEDICARE MEMBERS KATHY CENTER WHEN IT ON ALL OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THAT THE FIRST QUESTION ON THE AGENDA IS RELATED TO- KELLY'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE PRECIPITOUS DECLINE AND CAL WORKS AND WHAT COULD BE DONE TO TRY TO ARREST THAT INCREASE ALSO THE TAKE UP RATE IN THE PROGRAM. AS YOU HEARD- CAL WORKS CASES HAVE BEEN ON THE DECLINE SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN ALIGNED WITH ECONOMIC RECOVERY. HOWEVER WE'VE SEEN AND EVEN MORE RAPID DECLINE IN THE PAST NINE MONTHS. THEY CAN'T FUNDING INCREASES GENERALLY COINCIDED WITH THE REDETERMINATION PROCESS THESE THAT WERE INITIALLY POSTPONED FOR SIX MONTHS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. REDETERMINATION TYPICALLY HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME EVERY YEAR SO AS WE TALK WITH COUNTIES ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THE FACT THAT THESE READERS TERMINATIONS WERE DELAYED BY SIX MONTHS. RATHER THAN AN ENTIRE YEAR LIKELY CAUSE CONFUSION FOR MANY FAMILIES WHO WERE NOT EXPECTING THE PAPER WORK AND REQUIREMENTS TO OCCUR WHEN THEY GET. AS A RESULT MANY PEOPLE DID NOT COMPLETE THE REDETERMINATION. AND AS YOU HEARD THE BIGGEST REASON FOR DENIALS IS ALSO DUE TO PAPERWORK WHICH SPEAKS OF THE BURDEN FOR OUR CLIENTS OF THESE. PROCESS REQUIREMENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. NOT TO MENTION GOING THESE PROCESSES AND ALREADY OVERWHELMING TIME. IMPORTANTLY YOU WHEN SOMEONE DROPPED OFF A COUPLE WORKS PROGRAM THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK ON EVEN IF THEY COME BACK WITH QUICKLY WITH THE NECESSARY PAPERWORK. THEY BASICALLY HAVE TO REAPPLY ALL OVER AGAIN. UNLIKE WITH MEDI CAL WHERE SOMEONE CAN COME BACK AND BE- AND HAVE THEIR DISCONTINUANCE OR SEND IT UP TO NINETY DAYS AFTER THE FACT THAT THEY BRING THE INFORMATION BACK BUT THEY- FAILED TO PROVIDE. OUR WE DO NOT HAVE A GRACE PERIOD AND THE CALYX PROGRAM. AND THE APPLICANT RULES ARE MORE STRICT THAN THE RECIPIENT ROLES. IN PARTICULAR ARE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE INCREASE THE- EARNED INCOME DISREGARD FOR RECIPIENTS. MEANING THEY CAN KEEP MORE INCOME AND REMAIN ON THE PROGRAM. HOWEVER THE APPLICANT EARNED INCOME DISREGARD ROLE WAS MAINTAINED AT A VERY LOW LEVEL THAT HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. WHEN THE CALLER KERR GRAHAM WAS AN ACT THAT. WE HAVE LONG SEEN A TURN OF THE CASELOADS COST MEDIC CAL POLY WORKS IN CALFRESH. DELIVERIES PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS WE ARECURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE STATE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN A LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED PROCESS. TO EXAMINE THE PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND CAL FRESHMAN CAL WORKS. TO SEE HOW THEY CAN BE SIMPLIFIED TO MAKE IT LESS ONEROUS FOR CLIENTS. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE TO HELP ADDRESS THE SITUATION. WE RECOMMEND POLICIES THAT INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR FAMILIES ON OUR PROGRAM. INCREASES THE MAXIMUM AID PAYMENTS ARE COWARDS FAMILIES ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF STIMULUS PAYMENTS IT OR ONE TIME BENEFITS PROVIDED THE A PRE LOADED CARDS CAN ALL BE WAYS OF ACCOMPLISHING THIS. YOU CAN ALSO POTENTIALLY DO THIS VIA CAL FRESH WITH INCREASED NUTRITION BENEFITS HOUSEHOLDS PROVIDED OVER SOME NUMBER OF MONTHS. WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY DONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE SO THERE COULD BE POTENTIALLY ON SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES TO WORK OUT BUT WE FEEL IT'S WORTH DISCUSSING GIVEN HOW MUCH THE PANDEMIC IS INCREASED HUNGER FOR MILLIONS. AND DEMANDED CALIFORNIA'S. ALTHOUGH CONTINUING TO BOLSTER THE COWARDS PROGRAM GRANT INCREASES IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURE FAMILIES ARE LIVING ABOVE FIFTY PERCENT. OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL GIVEN THE CASE LAW DECLINES IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO EXAMINE UPFRONT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR PROGRAMS. THREE NAVAL AS MANY FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE TO RECEIVE THE SERVICE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM. THIS IS WHERE AN INCREASE TO THE APPLICANT YEAH ID TO BRING IT IN LINE WITH THE RECENTLY INCREASED RECIPIENT EARNED INCOME DISREGARD WOULD BE VERY USEFUL. IN THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS AT CEDAR BDA IS PUTTING FORTH THIS YEAR. ENSURE THAT ONE TIME AND PERIODIC FEDERAL AND STATE ENDEMIC AND EMERGENCY PAYMENTS ARE DISREGARDED FOR PURPOSES OF HOWARD'S ELIGIBILITY. ALLOW ELECTRONIC VERIFICATION OF IDENTITY AND CAL WORKS. THERE ARE NO PHYSICAL ID VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND MEDICAL OR CALFRESH BECAUSE WE HAVE MANY- REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER PROCEDURES IN PLACE. TO CATCH THE TUITIONS OR SOMEONE MAY BE TRYING TO DIVIDE US THOUGH ID FRAUD IS VERY RARE IN HESE PROGRAMS. HOWEVER AND HOW IT WORKS WE STILL REQUIRE PEOPLE TO COME IN PERSON TO THE OFFICE. THAT IS CURRENTLY SUSPENDED DUE TO THE PANDEMIC BUT WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE CONTINUED. PASSED THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND ALLOW FOR VISUAL ID VERIFICATION. PLATFORMS SUCH AS THE ONE WE'RE ON RIGHT NOW. WE ALSO RECOMMEND CREATING A ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE. FOR COUNTIES TO BE USED ACROSS PROGRAMS TO FURTHER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGY AND REQUIRED FOR YOUR PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR OFFICE. AND OF COURSE WE SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IN THE ADULT THAT PASSED THE L. A. O. AND THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDING COST OUT POSSIBLE ACTIONS. TO FURTHER FOR HIS PARTICIPATION IN AS WELL AS SUPPORT FOR THOSE ENROLLED IN OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAM. ON THE EXTENT OF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT CALFRESH ACCESS IN THE COLLEGE STUDENT ACCESS. AS YOU HEARD- WE'D HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DEMAND BOTH IN TERMS OF DATA AND FUND. DURING HOW FRESH. IN TWENTY TWENTY WE INITIALLY SAW VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE- IN APPLICATIONS BEGIN AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE CALL THE PANDEMIC. THAT CONTINUE THROUGH MAY. THE REST OF THE YEAR THE APPLICANTS WERE APPLICATIONS ARE MORE IN LINE WITH THE TWENTY NINETEEN APPLICANTS UNTIL WE FOUND ANOTHER SPIKE IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. SO FAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUR APPLICATIONS ARE TRENDING ABOVE THE PAST THREE YEARS. AND WE THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE STUDENT APPLICATION. THANK IT HAS ALSO AND THOUGH YET AS AS WAS PROJECTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. WE THINK THAT- THAT IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL THAT PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS THAT ARE- INCREASE THOSE BOMBS IT APPEARED THAT MAKE ARE EXCLUDED WHEN DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY IN THIS PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE STUDENT ELIGIBILITY WILL. WE'RE REALLY EXCITED AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE EXPANSION ON CALFRESH STUDENT ELIGIBILITY PARTICULARLY AS THE CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY TO AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH ZERO- I. AM SORRY- I. AM TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A WORK STUDY SO WE COULD BE LOOKING AT HALF A MILLION STUDENTS JOINING OUR PROGRAM DURING THIS YEAR. WHILE WORKING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO OUTRIGHT ELIMINATE THE STUDENT RULES WHICH ARE CONFUSING. AND DO NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR STUDENTS TO GET CALFRESH BENEFITS WE KNOW THAT HEALTH CRISIS UNDER UTILIZED AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE RULES AND REQUIREMENTS. SINCE THE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS BEGAN OUT REACHING TO THE STUDENTS AND FEBRUARY TO INFORM THEM OF THE TEMPORARY CHANGES WE HAVE SEEN A SPIKE IN OFFICE APPLICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE CALPERS APPLICATIONS FROM THE SAWS DATA ARE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WATER SYSTEMS SO THAT APPLICATIONS LAST MONTH IN THIS MONTH OF TRIED AND A KIND OF ABOVE THOSE FROM THE PAST THREE YEARS. WE BELIEVE THAT APPLICATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO COMMAND. AS I REACH CONTINUES TO STUDENTS. FIVE I JUST WANT NOTE FROM THE FOR THE X. COULD. TO BE SIX. RONNIE'S WILL NEED BE SOME IN. WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION PROVIDED COUNTIES WITH TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. TO ADDRESS THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXPANSION. AS- OUTREACH TO STUDENTS OF THESE TEMPORARY CHANGES. IN TEN YEARS WE MAY CONTINUE TO FACE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NEW APPLICATIONS AND WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THAT- ADMINISTRATION. TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE TO PUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING INTO THEM A REVISION AND WILL COME BACK AND TALK WITH YOU FURTHER ABOUT THOSE ESTIMATES AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM MIKE HERALD WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THANK YOU DR RANDALL. A MEMBERS AND OF THE COMMITTEE- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY CURLED THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND YES I AM WEARING MY FIRST SUIT AND TIE IN ABOUT ONE YEAR- WHAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S FOCUS TODAY ON HOW THE STATE CAN MAKE OUR PROGRAMS MORE RESPONSIVE- DURING BAD ECONOMIC TIMES I THINK ALL OF US HAVE BEEN REALLY CONCERNED WITH- THE DECLINES IN THE CASELOADS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN. I WOULD NOTE CALIFORNIA IS KNOWN FOR HAVING ONE OF THE STRONGEST HANNAH PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY WE PROVIDE YOU KNOW RELATIVELY HIGH BENEFIT AMOUNTS NOT ENOUGH BUT WE ALSO HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL OF THOSE WILL FAMILIES PARTICIPATING AND WE PROVIDE A PRETTY WIDE VARIETY OF WELFARE TO WORK ACTIVITIES IN OPTIONS AND WE PROVIDE SUPPORT OF SERVICES LIKE CHILDCARE TRANSPORTATION DIAPERS AND OTHER ANCILLARY BENEFITS THAT FAMILIES NEED IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE- BUT HAVING SAID THAT. OURS IS ALSO A LEGACY OF THE PAST THIS PROGRAM OF ALL FROM THE PREVIOUS AID TO FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN PROGRAM M. AND CAL WORKS WAS ADOPTED IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IT UTILIZING MANY OF THE OLD FTC ELIGIBILITY RULES LIKE THE IN IN THE SACK INCOME TEST THE HUNDRED OUR RULE AND. THE DEPRIVATION REQUIREMENTS. FOR OF MANY WE- TO USE QUARTERLY REPORT IN OF NUMBERS. RESULTED IN HIGH LEVELS OF CHURN FOR THE PROGRAM AND WE WERE MAINTAIN HARSH OVER PAYMENT RULES. BUT ON TOP OF ALL THAT. WE DID MANAGE CANNOT MANDATED REQUIREMENTS LIKE WORK REQUIREMENTS SANCTIONS AND TIME LIMITS ON EIGHT FOR ADULTS. MOST PROBLEMATIC WAS THE PUBLIC MESSAGING ABOUT CASH ASSISTANCE. IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT DECLARED THE END OF WELFARE AS WE KNOW IT. SO WE WERE SENDING OUT A LOT OF MESSAGES ABOUT THIS PROGRAM TO THE PUBLIC IN ABOUT ITS- WORTHINESS AND ALL OF THIS I THINK HAD UNPACKED ON CASELOADS EVEN BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF POWER SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. WE HAD SEEN LARGE DROPS IN THE CASELOAD AND EXCEPT FOR ONE BRIEF SPIKE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND TEN. THE STORY OF POWER HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF DECLINING CASELOADS. SOME SEE THIS IS A SIGN OF SUCCESS BUT ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS THAT WE HAVE BUILT A PROGRAM THAT'S MORE FOCUSED ON DENYING ELIGIBILITY AND ONE INTENDED TO HELP PEOPLE LEAVE POVERTY. ONE ONLY NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE THAT DESPITE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF POOR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WE HAVE THE LOWEST CASELOAD EVER. THAT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT BUT PERHAPS AN INTENTIONAL OUTCOME WE ATTRIBUTE MUCH OF THIS TO THE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS WE ERECTED TO GETTING ON AND STAYING ON ASSISTANCE. BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT HANNAH THE PROGRAM ITSELF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. IS PARTLY TO BLAME IT'S BORN OUT OF A OUT OF WHITE SUPREMACY AND INCLUDES A HARSH COMPLAINTS NATURE TO THE PROGRAM THAT WE THINK IS REALLY DRIVEN MANY FAMILIES AWAY. I DON'T SEE IT AS SOMETHING AFFECTED FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF POVERTY QUICKLY. SO YOU DON'T HAVE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES LATER ON THE AGENDA TO SPEAK ON THIS BUT I DID WANT OUTLINED A FEW THINGS THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND. THAT THE LEGISLATURE LOOK AT AND CONSIDER- GIVEN THESE. RATHER ALARMING DROPS IN THE CASELOAD. ONE IS REALLY SURE- WE AGREE WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS WE THINK WE SHOULD. MAKE THE INCOME. EXCUSE ME THE APPLICANT INCOME TEST TO BE THE SAME AS THE CURRENT- PARTICIPANT INCOME TEST. ON WE ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT IT OUGHT TO GO EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT. WE ALSO THINK WE NEED TO EXAMINE SOME OF THESE ARCHAIC RULES LIKE THE ON THE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR ENROLLMENT APPROBATION RULE- THERE REALLY ONLY DESIGNED TO REDUCE CASELOADS. AND NOT REALLY THEY DON'T REALLY PROVIDE. A POLICY BENEFIT. WE ALSO WOULD. AGREE THIRTY WELL FOR DIRECTORS THAT WE NEED TO REALLY MODERNIZE THE PROGRAM. AND REDUCE THE DOCUMENTATION THE VERIFICATIONS IN THE OFFICE VISITS NEEDED TO BECOME ELIGIBLE. AS WE SEEM DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN THE GOVERNOR SUSPENDED MANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM DID NOT SUFFER. IN FACT DOING SO- WE THINK ACTUALLY IS THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE. IT ALSO HAS THE EFFECT OF FREEING UP COUNTY STAFF TIME TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS MORE ON HELPING FAMILIES SUCCEED. AND FOCUS LESS ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. ONE WE ALSO REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER RAISING THE INCOME EXACT THRESHOLD. AND LOSE OUR ATTACHMENT TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. NOW THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY BEEN MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION IN RECENT YEARS BY INCREASING GRANTS IN THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD. BUT EVEN WITH THOSE CHANGES A FAMILY EXIT HOURS WHEN THEIR INCOME IS JUST TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ABOVE THE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE FEDERAL POVERTY. LEVEL AND THEY NOT ONLY YOU LOSE THEIR POWER AT THAT POINT BUT EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE POTENTIALLY CHILD CARE AND ALSO SOME OF SIR. THEY COULD GO WITH. SO WE REALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD EXTEND THE EXIT POINT FOR POWER AND PERHAPS LOOK TO DEVELOP A BETTER MEASURE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MEASURE. WHEN A FAMILY IS ABLE TO GO OFF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE- WE HAVE THINGS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA POVERTY MEASURE OR PERHAPS WE NEED TO EVEN THINK ABOUT DEVELOPING A METRIC LIKE ELDER ECONOMIC SECURITY INDEX. WHICH REALLY I THINK. DOES A FAR BETTER JOB IN ESTIMATING THE TRUE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA FOR FAMILIES AND SINCE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN IN THESE HOUSEHOLDS. WHOSE DEVELOPMENT REALLY DEPENDS ON US BEING ABLE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TOXIC STRESS THAT THEY LIVE WITH. WE THINK TRYING TO RAISE THESE LEVELS UP WOULD BE A REALLY CRUCIAL STEP TOWARD COMING AND IT WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE PROGRAM AND STAY ON IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK UP WITH PAM. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ANDREW SHANE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS. PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. OKAY ARE YOU SEE MY SCREEN FORGIVE ME FOR THAT UNTIL EITHER. WE CAN. OKAY I'LL BE I'M USING WILL BE BRIEF I APPRECIATE THE TIME THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS IN THE INTENT I'M INTERCHANGE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF. FOOD BANKS- THIS WAS ALREADY TOUCHED ON BY AS THE AND SO I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT BUT- JUST JUST THAT WE ALL. NOT FORGET WHERE WE ARE WE'RE STILL OFF THE CHARTS FROM WHERE WE'VE BEEN. AND I'LL BE PRESENTING SOME DATA THAT SPECIFICALLY- CORRELATE THE IMPACT OF JOBS LOST ON HUNGER FOR EVERY PERCENTAGE POINT IN UNEMPLOYMENT THERE'S ABOUT. THREE QUARTERS OR RELATION- CHU. TO FOOD AND SECURITY AND THEN JUST A REMINDER OF HOW LONG IT COULD BE INTEL- WE REACH. THE END OF THE GREAT RECESSION BUT EVEN THEN AND THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT HUNGER- BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT JUST WANT TO PROTECT. IMAGES ARE WE'VE ALL SAYING I'M IN MY HONEST MY HEART GOES OUT TO SOMEONE OF YOU THE MEMBERS THE STAFF- WHAT HAVE. EVEN THE MIDST OF THE- PUT ON MASS AND GOING TO THE DISTRIBUTIONS- BUT EVENTUALLY THE LINES WILL GO INSIDE- BUT WE CANNOT ALLOW HER TO BE HIDDEN. AND STIGMATIZEDAS IT HAS BEEN- FOR. YOUR FOR FAR TOO LONG AMONG JUST A QUOTE FROM BLAKE YOUNG WHO SERVES THE COUNTY AND I KNOW MANY OF YOU AGAIN SERVE AND- AND CONTRIBUTE TO- REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS. FOR FOOD SECURITY IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW. OUR DATA FROM I'M DYING SHINES IN BOX NATIONAL EXPERTS. BROKE DOWN AND STATE SPECIFIC INFORMATION INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHICS. OF FOOD INSECURITY DURING COVERT. DID IN TWENTY NINETEEN PARTICLE THAT. WOULDN'T SCREEN CALIFORNIA WAS NINE POINT NINE PERCENT- AROUND- YOU WANTED TEN. APPETITE NAY INDESCRIBABLY DID 223% EVEN REACHING TWENTY FIVE AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE BOTTOM LINE AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THAT'S THANKFULLY BACKED OFF JUST A BIT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE STILL AT RECORD LEVELS. AND CLEARLY YOU CAN SEE THE DEEP DISPARITIES. AS AS THE ANSWER OF SPOKE TO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS ON. THE RACIAL INJUSTICES BEHIND STUDENT SECURITY AND APPLYING POVERTY AND I APPRECIATE THE CHURCH COMMENTS ABOUT. THAT NEW OPENING REMARKS. SIMILARLY WITH RATES FOR CHIU. I'M A SHOCKING THAT ACTUALLY WAS EVEN RATE CHILDREN- FIFTEEN FOR TWO PER IN THE LINE THERE AND AGAIN THOSE DEEP DEEP DESPAIR FOR LOWER. CAN OF COLOR. SO WHAT HAPPENED TO DEFEAT BANKS I KNOW MANY OF YOU SAW WITH YOUR OWN EYES BUT- THANKS TO WORK BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES CAL WE ASK HELP ON TEARS WE ACTUALLY HAVE MORE DATA THAN EVER BEFORE WHICH YOU KNOW WAS SO HELPFUL TO STATE POLICYMAKERS. SO IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT- THE BEST ESTIMATE WAS THAT- FOOD BANKS WERE SERVING. APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION PER WEEK BECAUSE OF IT- IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SEARCH PER WEEK AND SO IT'S A HOUSEHOLD WENT TWICE TO GET COUNTED TWICE IN THIS IS THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE. OR THE DUPLICATED COUNT INCLUDING SPEAK- SO WE WENT FROM ONE MILLION PRIOR TO BECAUSE OF IT INST ALMOST INSTANTLY TO THREE MILLION AND THE NEARLY FIVE MILLION- BUT WE SAW IT AT THE END OF YEARS ACTUALLY STABILIZED AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PERCENT. I'M IN FACT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN UNDER REPRESENTATION HERE BECAUSE AS WE BANKS GOT INTO THE BUSY HOLIDAY SEASON THERE WERE SOME REPORTING SO WE ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN THE NUMBER WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER NOVEMBER. IMAGINE THE SAME THING FOR DECEMBER- ACT DURING THAT TIME IT'S NOT REALLY SPEAKS TO AS AS TRUCKING JOHNSON SPOKE TO EARLIER JUST A MOMENT OF NEED FOR FOOD ON WHICH- AS YOU CAN SEE THE FOOD SUPPORTS. THANKFULLY ROSE SUBSTANTIALLY. THROUGH THE SUMMER. I THE TO GO AND SEE COMING EARLY. AND THAT. THE MAJOR BY. IN THE- WEST PLAN ARE STILL LOOKING AT A FIVE. FOOD OF NASH MORE THAN A BILLION. DOWN FROM THREE TWENTY TWENTY- AND SO THAT DOES WE CONTINUE TO ASK FROM CONGRESS OBVIOUSLY BUT THAT IS THE CASE- FOR- BUT WE'RE SEEING. THE SAME DEMAND AT THE TO OUR PERCENT LEVEL BUT WE'RE SEEING A POTENTIAL DROP OFF AND FEDERAL FOOD- PUTS THE FOCUS ON AS WAS SAID EARLIER OF THE STATE'S ABILITY TO CLOSE GAPS IN THE FOOD SAFETY NET. OTHER PROGRAMS. I JUST HOPE THAT- YOU KNOW ALL STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE DEPARTMENTS TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THE GOVERNOR. I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS THIS PROGRAM IS AND I REALLY THINK DIRECTOR JOHNSON FOR HER COMMENTS. WE'RE SEEING SOME PICTURES ACTUALLY OF THE FOOD- AND TRULY WAS GOVERNMENT AT ITS AT ITS FINEST- WITHIN A FEW WEEKS REALLY IN MARCH- BY THE END OF THE MONTH THERE WAS ALREADY THESE. THESE BOXES FLOWING ACROSS THE STATE. THERE PROVIDING SHELF STABLE FOODS THAT ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY BECAUSE OF INCREASED DEMAND A GROCERS MEANS THERE'S LESS. DONATIONS OF THESE FOODS. I MEAN ONE THING THAT I DIDN'T APPRECIATE WHEN THIS PROGRAM. BEGAN IS THAT IT ACTUALLY SUPPORTS ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA JOBS. MANY OF WHICH ARE UNION TEAMSTERS BUILDING THE BOXES SHIPPING THEM TO FOOD BANKS. AND SUPPORTING THE HARD HIT FOOD. SERVICES SECTOR I'M AS RESTAURANTS AND OTHERS YOU KNOW STILL ARE ONLY BEGINNING TO RE OPEN. AND SO I JUST HOPE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT'S BUILDING THAT CIRCULAR FOOD ECONOMY IN ADDITION. TO FIGHTING HUNGER IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I'M INTERESTED OF QUICK. OF THE THERE. TO AT BY BANKS- WE'RE SEEING ON THE LEFT DOCTOR ARE BELOW- FROM THE FEEDBACK SERVING DISTRICT- NEW PARTNERSHIP SERVING- AS WELL AS HIS UP NORTH. IN FOOD FOR PEOPLE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY- FEEDING THAT. THE WHO THE TRIBE- BUT YOU HAD THESE PROGRAMS- AS STRUCTURE DOESN'T MENTIONED FOOD BANKS DSS ARE DOING MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. TO CLOSE GAPS IN SAFETY NET BUT OFTEN DOES COME WITH THE HIGHEST COSTS. WE HAVE THE MOST REMOTE LOCATIONS THE LATEST HOURS AND THE HIGHEST NEED FOR CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FOODS- BETTER. DIFFICULT CONSUMERS AT SCALE. THE SAME TIME. I THINK EVERYONE'S FAMILIAR JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALL GROUNDED THAT EVEN DRINK COCONUT INCREDIBLE BURDEN ON LOW INCOME FAMILIES EMERGENCY FOOD PROVIDERS CALFRESH IN THE PROGRAMS. THAT THE REST OF THE DISASTERS NEVER STOPPED WE HAVE THE WORST WILDFIRE SEASON IN HISTORY STATE HISTORY AND WE HAVE THE RETURN OF BLACKOUTS AND SOME PS PS EVENTS- FOR THE FIRST TIME THOSE BLACKOUTS IN. TWENTY ODD YEARS- AND I SPENT MUCH OF THE CREEK FIRE BECAUSE THAT GROUP ARE ACTUALLY DISRUPTED. THE SERVICE TO THE RANCHERIA IN FRESNO COUNTY- AND SO WHEN WE HAVE THESE MULTIPLE COMPOUNDING DISASTER. RELIEF BUT STRESS ON- THAT THE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS TRYING. TO SERVE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. SO HOPE THAT. ANIMUS WILL CONSIDER PROPOSALS THAT WE BROUGHT FORWARD AND WE'RE SEEING- WE'RE SEEING AT A CHART THERE ON THE RIGHT THAT REALLY HITS HOME FOR WHY WE NEED TO HAVE INTERVENTION RIGHT NOW. I'M CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET CONDITION ME INSTEAD MORE AND CAN SHOULD BE DONE. JUSTICE FAMILIES OF HUNGRY CHILDREN CAN'T SAVE FOR A RAINY DAY THE STATE NEEDS TO USE ITS TEMPERATURE QUESTION TO MEET IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND TRYING TO PREVENT THIS MATHIS SPIKE. AND THE LONG DECLINE AND SO WE HAVE BROUGHT FOR PROPOSALS AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL- FOR US IN THE GROUP WICKS. I'M SUPPORTING THE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL COVERED FOOD SUPPORTS A STRUCTURED JOHNSON MENTIONED THERE IS A NEW STATE INTERMEDIARY CALPERS LOGISTICS. BUT BILLS CAPACITY AN EXPANSIVE POTENTIAL OF THIS PROGRAM- AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THE SUMMER REVIEW IF THE DO A- ANA AND I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE FOOD BANKS DON'T LOSE FOODS DURING- POWER SHUT OFFS. OR P. S. P. S. OFFENSIVE FIRES WE HAD SOME VERY CLOSE CALLS LOW JUST HAPPENED IN TEXAS WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN HERE- AND BEAT THE SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY NEEDS. ARE CONTINUING TO SERVE SO MANY I'M CAN YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE- FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SO THANK. YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THANK YOU NOW WE WILL FROM. CRAPPIE LEAD CHAPTER. FOR VOICE CAL. HELLO CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JENNIFER CRAPPIE AND I AM THE LEAD CHAPTER ORGANIZER WITH HER VOICE IS CALIFORNIA. WE'RE STATEWIDE LED ORGANIZATION WITH THIRTEEN CHAPTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING A DIVERSE GROUP OF FAMILIES. THANK YOU I NEED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME OF THE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT PARENTS HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM DURING THE PANDEMIC AND BEYOND. THIS IS WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM FAMILIES AS TO WHY THEY'RE NOT ACCESSING HEALTH WORKS PROGRAM. THE BIGGEST REASON- I'LL IS THAT SOCIETY HAS DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB OF MAKING FAMILIES WHO NEED GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT IT. THIS STIGMA IS SO DEEP THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE JUDGED BY SINCE VIçT BRANDS FAMILY FOR NEEDING HELP. FOR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. THEY FEAR THAT ACCESSING SUPPORT SERVICES THROUGH CAL WORKS WILL IMPACT THEIR IMMIGRATION CASE TO THE PUBLIC CHARGE. EVEN THOUGH THAT ROLE HAS BEEN THROWN OUT BY THE COURTS LAST WEEK IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF TRYING TO REBUILD. IMMIGRANT FAMILIES TRUST THAT APPLYING FOR SERVICES WILL NOT IMPACT THEIR PATHWAY TO RESIDENCY OR CITIZENSHIP. FAMILIES ARE HERE. BECAUSE THEY ARE FOOD INSECURE A LACK STABLE HOUSING CHILDCARE AND LESS THAN ADEQUATE CIRCUMSTANCES MAKING CPS INTERVENTIONS ALL TOO REAL. UNEMPLOYMENT IS PROVIDING STABILITY FOR SO MANY FAMILIES WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE ON CAL WORKS. IT IS REQUIRED FOR COUCH PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE WORKING PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC TO APPLY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT IF ELIGIBLE THUS MAKING THEM ELIGIBLE FOR CAL WORKS GRANTS BUT THEY CAN STILL ACCESS SUPPORTED SERVICES. ONCE THESE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT STOPS FAMILIES AGAIN WILL LOOK TO THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM FOR HELP AND SUPPORT. TO UNDO THE STIGMA AND TO MAKE THE CALL WORKS PROGRAM ACTUALLY WORKS WITH FAMILIES HERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS FROM HOWARD'S CLIENTS THEMSELVES. FIRST LIFT SANCTIONS FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAMS DUE TO LIMITED JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND LIMITED SCHOOL OPTIONS. WAVE HOW WORKS OVER PAYMENT COLLECTIONS FROM FAMILIES QUALIFY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. SO MANY FAMILIES OVERPAYMENTS DUE BECAUSE IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THEM TO ACCESS THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. MAKE PERMANENT ONLINE APPLICATION AND DOCUMENT COLLECTIONS THAT CAN STREAMLINE AND INCREASE NEW APPLICATIONS SPEEDING UP APPLICATIONS AND PROCESSING I'M IN A TIMELY MANNER. REQUIRE COUNTIES TO BETTER UTILIZE THE CAL WORKS DIVERSION PROGRAM. AT THIS COULD PROVIDE ONE TIME CASH BENEFITS TO COVER RENT YOU ELOISE CHILD CARE AND OTHER COSTS THAT WOULD PREVENT FAMILIES FROM HAVING TO GO BACK ON HOW WORKS PROGRAM. FREEZE ALL TIME FOX. ALL TIME CLOCK. AND TELL THE PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED AT. I'M SORRY SKEWS ME AT AND TELL ALL. JUST STOP I'M PROVIDE- CODES FOR CAL WORKS FAMILIES SO THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE VACCINES THIS WE'VE SEEN THIS WORK IN THE CHILD CARE INDUSTRY AND IT'S A REALLY GREAT WAY TO ENGAGE SONOMA FAMILY. REQUIRE COUNTIES TO BETTER UTILIZE THE COW WORKS DIVERSION PROGRAM THIS COULD PROVIDE ONE TIME CASH PAYMENTS TO COVER RENT UTILITIES CHILDCARE AND OTHER COSTS. PROVIDE I'M SORRY SCRUB THE CHILD CARE WAITING LIST TO IDENTIFY CAL WORKS A LEGIBLE FAMILIES. AND PROVIDE THE FUNDING THAT áP IN OUR IN OUR AGENCIES WOULD NEED TO DO THAT. I PROVIDE FUNDING TO STRENGTHEN CONNECTIONS BETWEEN TV AGENCIES AND CHILD CARE AGENCIES TO SCREEN SURVIVORS FOR CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE. MANY OF THESE FAMILIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR POWER ADDED FOR CHILD CARE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE. WE NEED TO BE MORE DELIBERATE IN ASKING IF A FAMILY IS A DV SURVIVOR AND CHANGE THE WAIVER PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS TO A SHALL INSTEAD OF A MAY. EXPAND HOME VISITING TO PROVIDE ONE TIME ONE ON ONE NAVIGATION SERVICES FOR FAMILIES FIVE BABIES DURING THE PANDEMIC. I HAVE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO EARLY MORNING. FIRE PASSED CAL WORKS PARTICIPANTS TO SUPPORT AND HELP NEW CLIENTS NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. AND REQUIRE ALL COUNTIES TO COMPLY IT ALL WORKS TO RIGHT NOW. HOWARD'S TWO POINT OH IS IN EVIDENCE AS AUTHENTIC PARENTING DETACHMENT STRATEGY IN A REAL WAY OUT OF POVERTY FOR FAMILIES. THE PANDEMIC AND THE CRISIS CAN BECOME AN OPPORTUNITY. NOT TO RETURN TO NORMAL BUT TO REBUILD AND RE CREATE A SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR FAMILY. BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO GET FAMILIES WERE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THESE ISSUES A SEAT AT THE TABLE IN CREATING SYSTEMS THAT WORK FOR THAT. ANYBODY WHO'S READY TO DO THAT WERE READY TO WORK WITH YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU JENNIFER AND WHAT AN APPROPRIATE WAY FOR US TO AND THAT FIRST PANELS LIKE TO THANK ALLTHE PANEL FOR THEIR TESTIMONY I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. I WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR ALL THE PRESENTERS ANOTHER ESPECIALLY. TO THOSE ARE BRINGING UP THE COORDINATION WITH THE TRIBAL GROUPS AND TRIBAL TOWN OF- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS FOR THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION- THE SPEAKER- MENTIONED THAT THEY WERE WORKED WITH THE HOOPA TRIBE. BUT I'M LOOK BECAUSE WE HAD A HEARING OF THEIR SELECT COMMITTEE WE FOUNDED THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION. DURING A COVERT NINETEEN AND SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS WAS A LITTLE CHALLENGING FOR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. SO IS THERE ANY- INPUT THAT. YOU COULD ADVISE US ON OF HOW THAT WORKED THERE WITH THE HOOPA. TRIBE THAT THEN WE COULD ACTUALLY START TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN BUILDING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. HI THIS IS SANDRA FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS THE DEPARTMENT MAY ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS THIS MORNING I CAN SEE. THAT THE FOOD BANK FOOD FOR PEOPLE HAS HAD A LONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WHO BUT TRIED THAT ACTUALLY LOST ITS GROCERY STORE AND THE FOOD BANK WAS ONE OF ITS ONLY SOURCES OF SUPPORTS- BUT AS I SAID. AS I SPOKE TO IT IS IMPERFECT I'M IT IS COSTLY THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY SO I THINK I WILL ON THE POINT ABOUT NEEDING TO REALLY DO AN ASSESSMENT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE FROM. CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FOODS CHU THE HOURS THE LOCATIONS- AND THE SUSTAINABILITY BUT I THINK IT. IN THIS KIM JONG. DEPART OF SOCIAL SERVICES ALL JUST ADD TO ADD VERY EARLY ON THE PANDEMIC AS WE WERE WITH MANY GROUPS WE DID HAVE A SPECIFIC. A CALL WITH TRIBES ARE OFFICE OF TRIBAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR HEATHER HOSLER CONVENES ACT. SO THAT WE COULD ADDRESS AND IDENTIFY ANY AND THAT NEEDS FOR THAT WERE HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE THAT IS WHERE. WE SAW EIGHT EIGHT SOME GAPS IN IN FOOD AND WERE ABLE TO THEN FOLLOW UP TO BE MORE TARGETED IN THEIR SPECIFIC OUTREACH TO ADDRESS THOSE SO. WE CONTINUED THOSE CONVERSATIONS THROUGHOUT OUR TRAVEL ADVISORY. COMMITTEE AND OUR CONSULTATION- BUT BUT CERTAINLY THAT INITIAL THAT REACH OUT TO ADDRESS UNMET NEEDS- WAS THAT A GOOD SOURCE OF INFORMATION TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY WHERE WE CAN FOCUS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT THAT OUR OFFICE CAN DO TO SOLIDIFY SOME OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN INDIAN COUNTRY. TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THE NEXT CRISIS HITS BECAUSE WE KNOW ONE WILL. WHETHER IT'S FIRE OR OR RAIN OR WATER. OR EVEN ANOTHER- PANDEMIC HOPEFULLY NOT. BUT THAT THE GROUNDWORK AND INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE SO THAT THE FOOD BANKS CAN. I'M START TO DELIVER- IN A SEAMLESS FLOW TO THE- INDEED COMMUNITIES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR OFFICE IS OPEN TO WORKING WITH YOU TO ENSURE THOSE RELATIONSHIP. BUILDING TECHNIQUES CONTINUE. TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. I AM GOING TO START MY QUESTIONS TODAY WITH THE L. A. L. BEFORE I. TURN BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT ASK QUESTIONS REGARDING CAL WORKS AND CALFRESH. AND FOR RYAN ANDERSON I WAS TRYING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING IF I COULD ABOUT THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AND HOW IT COULD SPECIFICALLY HELP CALIFORNIA'S ANTI POVERTY PROGRAMS. IT HAPPENED SO RECENTLY THAT I REALLY WAS HOPING TO GET YOUR EXPERTISE AND OPINION ON IT. SPECIFICALLY. PANDEMIC EMERGENCY FUNDS AND WHAT OPTIONS DOESTHE LEGISLATURE HAVING USE OF THOSE FUNDS. YES RYAN ANDERSON WITH LA- AGAIN- WE'RE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF REVIEWING THOSE PROPOSALS- IN IN PARTICULAR WE- ARE LOOKINGTO GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE POTENTIAL USE OF THOSE ARE. ENDEMIC EMERGENCY FUNDS THEY THEY DO APPEAR THAT THEY COULD PROVIDE SOME SUPPLEMENTAL ASSISTANCE TO I COMMERCE ELIGIBLE FAMILIES BUT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT. AT THIS TIME ON WHAT THE- BOUNDARIES OF THAT ASSISTANCE OR THE OTHER- ASSISTANCE THAT I WOULD CALL OUT AS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO THIS COMMUNITY WOULD BE THE EXPANSION OF THE CHILD TAX CREDIT- WHICH WILL IMPACT CAL WORKS ELIGIBLE FAMILIES ON. IT IN SOME CASES TREMENDOUSLY- ESPECIALLY IF AS THAT IS POSSIBLE IT IS RENDERED INTO A MONTHLY PAYMENT OR MONTHLY INSTALLMENT AS OPPOSED TO AN ANNUAL LUMP SUM SO THOSE ARE THINGS WE'RE MONITORING AND WE'LL WE'LL GET BACK. TO YOU AS SOON AS WE CAN AS WE LEARN MORE. THANK YOU AND- NOW GOING TO ON CAL WERE IF I CAN AND- WOULD LIKE TO PULL IN- DIRECTOR. JOHNSON OR DEPUTY DIRECTOR HERNANDEZ INTO THE CONVERSATION BUT I'M REALLY FOCUSED A BIT ON CASELOADS AND- WANT TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING FROM YOU- REGARDING DENIALS IT SEEMS THAT- MILES HAVE BEEN INCREASING. IN THE PANDEMIC IN THE GENDERED STATED IT WAS AT TO REALLY DIG IN AND FIGURE OUT WHAT ELSE WE COULD BE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE KEEPING PEOPLE ON TO THE PROGRAM AND THEN NOT DENYING THEM. ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM EXCUSE ME. THANK YOU CHAIR CAN JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES NOW ALSO ACTORS ARE DEPUTY DIRECTOR TO JOIN ME IN THE CONVERSATION HERE. IN TERMS OF THE NILE SPECIFICALLY AGAIN I THINK PART OF IT- IS WE WANT THAT WE SPOKE TO A LITTLE BIT AROUND THE- INCOME THE DIVISIONAL INCOME AND THAT BEING COUNTED- AND THEREFORE MAKING- INDIVIDUALS- INELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES I WOULD SAY- IN TERMS OF- THOSE THAT ARE PARTICIPATING AND- WANTING TO ENSURE THAT THEIR ON ONE EFFORT THAT WE ARE UNDERTAKING. THAT NOT ONLY FOR CAL WORKS BUT ALSO FOR A CALFRESH IS OUR VERIFICATION HAVE WORK. AND THAT IS SUPPORTING AT THE AT BILLETE KIND OF BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE BACKGROUND USING THE TECHNOLOGY. TO ENSURE THAT NO MATTER IF IT SAY ELIGIBILITY WORKER AT LOOKING FOR CAL WORKS ARE CAFES PURPOSES THAT THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO. OBTAIN THAT THE INCOME UPDATES OTHER OTHER VERIFICATIONS ARE IN THE SYSTEM THE SYSTEM KINGS OUT OF THAT BUT THE BURDEN IS LESSENED ON BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL RECIPIENTS AS WELL AS THE PROGRAM THE COUNTY THEMSELVES TO HAVE TO. GO MOST PLACES THAT'S ONE EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN I'M SERVICES BUT IN TERMS OF THE NILES AGAIN IT'S SOME OF THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT THAT THEN MADE. MAKE THEM TO BE JEWEL'S INELIGIBLE BUT I DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE DEPUTY DIRECTOR. AT HERNANDEZ THAT SHE'D LIKE TO ADD MORE. THE ONLY OTHER ADDITION I WOULD MAKE IS WHAT JENNIFER CRAPPIE ALLUDED TO EARLIER- AROUND THIS THE MESSAGING COMMUNICATION- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT. IF FOR SOME REASON FOLKS WERE DENIED THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY COULD POTENTIALLY APPLY AT A LATER DATE RIGHT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CONFUSION WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER. PANDEMIC RELATED ASSISTANCE- THAT MAY HAVE DEEMED FOLKS INELIGIBLE AND SO BEING ABLE TO ADD TO PROACTIVELY ENGAGE THEM THROUGH THAT COMMUNICATION IS GONNA BE REALLY CRITICAL MOVING FORWARD. SO ALONG THOSE LINES- WE SPEND A LOT OF OUR TIME IN THIS COMMITTEE ALSO LOOKING AT MEDIKAL I'M- WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN SUSPEND RE DETERMINATIONS THROUGH THE DURATION OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AS- WE HAVE DONE WITH THE MEDICAL. YES I BEGIN WE ARE LOOKING TO PROVIDE AS MUCH PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY AS WE CANNOT CROSS ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS HERE SO. OUT FOR THE% PURPOSES OF WHAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED TO DATE WE ARE. PROPOSING TO CONTINUE THAT AFTER THAT TO THE EMERGENCY. NEXT QUESTION IF I COULD IS FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT C. W. D. A. HAD COMMENTED ON REGARDING THE GRACE PERIOD- I WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT TEND TO THE COMPARISONS WITH MEDICAL. DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND AN INDUSTRY WANT TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. I APOLOGIZE COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION I WAS HAVING TROUBLE HEARING C. W. D. A. HAD COMMENTED THAT THERE WAS A GRACE PERIOD FOR A RE DETERMINATIONS THAT HAD NOT SUBMITTED THE APPROPRIATE PAPERWORK AND THAT. ON MEDICARE ALL WE WERE ABLE TO RETURN BACK TO BEING BACK ON MEDIC CAL WHILE ON CAL WORKS WE HAD TO REAPPLY AND WAS WONDERING WHY THERE WAS NOT A GRACE PERIOD WITH AND CAL WORKS. SO THIS IS A CHALLENGING ONE- SO- THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE FEDERALLY MANDATED AND THEY ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED BETWEEN CAL WORKS AND CALFRESH AND SO IT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FLEXIBILITIES TO ONE PROGRAM AND NOT THE OTHER AND SO WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT- THE REDETERMINATION- PERIOD HERE FOR KICKING THE CAN FORWARD IF YOU WILL- WE DID IT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY FOR BOTH PROGRAMS. I'M SO SEPARATING THAT OUT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE- GIVEN HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT-OUR AUTOMATION SYSTEM- TO CLOSELY ALIGN INTERCONVERT THOSE THOSE POLICY ALIGNMENT AND AGAIN A LOT OF THAT IS FEDERALLY DRIVEN- I. THOUGHT YOUR COMMENT EARLIER ABOUT HOW THE REGION TERMINATIONS ALLOWED US TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD BUT THAT THE BENEFIT IS FAMILIES CAN STAY ON LONGER. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING FAMILY STAY ON LONGER IF WE CANNOT END THUS THE REASONING WHY I WAS ASKING ABOUT RE DETERMINATIONS. THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY I. FEEL LIKE I'VE MADE MY POINT THE ONES WHO WOULD LIKE TO- NOW MOVE ON TO A QUESTION IF I CAN REGARDING THE ONE POINT 5% THAT SOME COUNTIES ARE RECEIVING- WITHIN CAL WORKS AND- WHETHER OR NOT THAT. EQUITABLE IS THAT. AN APPROPRIATE WAY FOR US TO BE DISTRIBUTING THESE RESOURCES. AGAIN DEFERRED TO. DEPUTY DIRECTOR HAND ANDERSON ON THAT QUESTION THANK YOU. I'M NOT SURE THAT I AND I CLEARLY UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION APOLOGIES- I'M- ON PAGE NINETEEN OF THE AGENDA IS A- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE POINT 5% INCREASE TO CAL ARTS GRANTS FOR CERTAIN COUNTIES THAT ALL APPEAR TO BE ON THE COAST. AND I'M WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS AN EQUITABLE WAY AND CONSISTENT WAY THAT WE HAVE- APPLIED- INCREASES TILL CAL WORKS GRANTS OR OTHER PROGRAMS. OKAY NOW I AM TRACKING APOLOGIES FOR THAT THANK YOU- SO PART OF WHAT THIS DOES IS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE LOWER COST COUNTIES AND THE COASTAL COUNTIES. AND SO REALLY IT IS LOOKING AT THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE A- UNFORTUNATELY- DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER- HIGHER COST OF LIVING RIGHT AND SO- IF I'M UNDERSTANDING LOOKING AT THE CHART THAT IT'S ON PAGE NINETEEN I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS WHAT IT'S REFERENCING. I AM HAPPY TO HELP US FOLLOW UP IN A CONVERSATION I THINK WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO DIG INTO HIS THIS IS NOT- CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE DO WITH ANOTHER PROGRAMS. AND SO I'M REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT'S STILL PRESENT WITHIN- TODAY'S PROGRAM AND WHAT REASONS- WE HAVE BECAUSE I. DO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE- WORKING TO PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES TOWARDS OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR REPRESENTING. PORTION OF THE MAP THAT IS NOT SEEING THOSE INCREASES. MANY OF US ARE CONCERNED THAT WE'RE NOT RECEIVING OUR FAIR SHARE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO TAKEN TO WITHOUT QUESTION. WITH THAT I WILL TRANSITION TO CALFRESH IF I CAN. AND WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF I COULD. NOT CURRENTLY. EXCUSE ME- THE DEPARTMENT EARLIER HAD SAID THAT YOU WERE WORKING ON EQUITABLE PARTICIPATION BY WORKING ON LANGUAGE ACCESS AND WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD EXPAND UPON THAT FURTHER. GLAD TO CHAIR- CAN JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. APPLE OF THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE- OVER TIME TO REALLY AGAIN BOTH AB MAP- AT DEMOGRAPHIC LANGUAGE NEEDS- IN THE AND MAP THAT AGAINST ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS AND CREWS CURRENTLY RECEIVING. CALFRESH SERVICES WE DID THIS AS PART OF THE CALIFORNIA FOOD FOR ALL WORKGROUP ADD THAT WE WORKED ON WITHIN THE NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS- PREVIOUSLY I REALLY TRYING TO AGAIN IDENTIFIES SOME TARGETED STRATEGIES AND WHERE WE ARE SEEING KIND OF THAT THE GREATEST GAPS AT IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE ACCESS WE ALSO HAD- A- A FELLOW FROM AT UC BERKELEY- DO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK TO IDENTIFY HOW WE COULD IMPROVE. UPON A LANGUAGE ACCESS IN ALL ALL ALL KINDS OF RECOMMENDATIONS OPTIONS EVERYTHING FROM HOW INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE OF COURSE I WRITTEN DOCUMENTS ETCETERA AND THAT CERTAINLY AYE WE CONTINUE TO OFFER ALL OPTIONS IN THE MULTIPLE MODALITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS TO CONNECT WITH THE PROGRAM SO. AGAIN I THINK OUR OUR EFFORT INTO ALSO DISCREPANCIES EARLIER COMMENT RELATED TO OUR POPULATIONS IN THE PUBLIC CHARGE IMPACT WHAT THAT STANDS FOR COMMUNITIES WE AGREE AND RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. OR AT CERTAIN COMMUNITIES TO RE ENGAGE AND WE DID SEE SOME CHANGE OVER TIME IN TERMS OF A BOTH A NEW ENROLLMENTS AND ALSO I IN TERMS OF THOSE STAYING ON PROGRAM SO WE WANT TO BE FOCUSED IN OUR OUTREACH STRATEGIES- ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO CALFRESH AGAIN USING SOME OF THAT INFORMATION THAT WE'VE- OBTAINED TO DATE AND THE FEEDBACK WE'RE RECEIVING FROM FROM THOSE THAT ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR AND I WILL JUST COMMENT MY OFFICE HAS- IN JOINT PARTNERING. AND WORKING WITH YOU ON. CASH OUT FOR SSI WITH CALFRESH AND LOOK FOR TO OR WITH YOU AS WE EXTEND THESE BENEFITS- WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION- BUT DID WANT TO ASK IF I COULD THAT IT DOES SEEM THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF TURN THAT IS. GOING ON THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB RECENTLY REPORTED. AN ESTIMATE THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALFRESH HOUSEHOLDS EXIT BECAUSE OF. ADMINISTRATIVE REASONS OUR PAPERWORK REASONS. AND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE ARE STILL ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. MY QUESTION IS THE DEPARTMENT DOING OUTREACH TO THE HOMELESS- APPLICANTS INTO SEEING IF WE CAN INCLUDE THEM IN OUR PROGRAM. I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION VERY MUCH CHAIR AND SHARE THE CONCERN AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH A CALIFORNIA POLICY LAP AROUND THIS ANALYSIS AND- SO YES AS REPORT ADDS. THAT CURRENTLY IDENTIFIES UNDER FEDERAL REGULATIONS WE HAVE MOST OF OUR CALFRESH AT CASELOAD INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING CERTIFIED FOR TWELVE MONTHS IN THE REQUIRED TO. REPORT A PERIOD AT THE SIX MONTH MARK TWELVE MONTH MARK INCLUDING AN INTERVIEW AND SO. WHAT WE'VE DONE IN RESPONSE- IN RELATIONSHIP TO COLD IT IN AGAIN- ONE OF LIFT UP THE MANY WAYS THAT WE'VE BEEN CREATING ADDITIONAL MODALITIES FOR PEOPLE TO ENGAGE AS WELL AS FLEXIBILITY SPENT WE DID. OFTEN TO A WAIVER TO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO WAIVE THAT INTERVIEW REQUIREMENT AT ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION AND RECERTIFICATION FIRST FOR HOUSEHOLD TO SUBMIT A COMPLETE APPLICATION. THAT WEAVER AT WILL WILL TAKE US THROUGH THIS IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR- WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD BETTER ANXIOUSLY ENGAGED WITH USDA TO CONTINUE THAT WAY BURKE POST PANDEMIC SO WE'RE GLAD TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT FRONT. INDIVIDUALLY AND APART FROM A COPAYS WE M. AS REQUIRED BY LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BILL AT THE SCHOOL TO THE WORKGROUP WHICH STAKEHOLDERS TO ASSESS THE STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION OF SIMPLIFIED REPORTING. AND IDENTIFYING AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT THAT ARE WITHIN THE AT THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS WE ARE GOING TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT- AND POTENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF A PRE POPULATED OUT A BIT CERTIFICATION FORM. TO HELP PROVIDE CLIENTS ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS CURRENTLY ON FILE WITH THE COUNTY AND ASK THEM TO REAFFIRM WHICH WE THINK COULD ALSO. MAKE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE CONTRIBUTION I IN THAT SPACE. I'M WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- TO IMPROVE COMPLETION RATES AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CODE FOR AMERICA WE'VE EXPANDED BEGETS CALFRESH APPLICATION ASSISTANCE TOOL. AT TO INCLUDE THAT MADE APPLICATION REPORTING THAT'S IT NOW. AVAILABLE IN TWENTY NINE COUNTIES AND IN SOME AT TEXTRON. FOR THE PURCHASE IN SOME LIVE CHAT THAT HELPS Q. AND A- I ALSO NOTE THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. REALLY FOCUS AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP THAT YOU MENTIONED ON SUPPORTING OUR SOCIETY POPULATION GETTING ACCESS. SO AB TO ENSURE THERE'S A BENEFIT RETENTION IN OUR OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE. WITH DISABILITIES- WE ARE- IMPLEMENTING THE ELDER SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION IN ELIMINATING THAT RE CERTIFICATION ENERGY REQUIREMENTS IMPROVING ALSO A THIRTY SIX MONTH WINDOW SILVA HAVE A LONGER- APPLICATION PERIOD AGAIN NOT ANTICIPATING CHANGES TO OCCUR FOR THAT SPECIFIC POPULATION SO. I THOSE ARE SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AND HAVE ACTUALLY OPERATIONALIZED AB ABSOLUTELY WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE. OF THE RETENTION ESPECIALLY OF COURSE FOR THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO CONTINUE ON THE PROGRAM. Q- FINAL QUESTION CALIFORNIA SHOULDN'T WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE PANDEMIC AND PLEINEMENT COMPENSATION. MADE MANY HOUSEHOLDS AN ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH ORIGINALLY BUT NOW THAT THE POCD IS EXCLUDED FROM CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY WHAT STRATEGIES ARE BEING USED TO RECONNECT THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WITH THE PROGRAM. SURE AS I'VE MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER REMARKS WE HAVE CREATED A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY ET DE I AND SOME OTHER STATE PARTNERS TO TEST OUT A TARGETED OUTREACH CAMPAIGN SO AGAIN AS WE'VE BEEN AT- AS I THINK WAS REFERENCED EARLIER APPROACHING VARIOUS CLIFFS AND TERMS OF AT AT AND IMPLEMENT POTENTIALLY ENDING WHICH AGAIN GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE CONTINUING. WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM TO GENERATE THROUGH THEIR SYSTEMS THE CONNECTION TO CALFRESH- AND SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT KIND OF COLLABORATION TO BE FOCUSED AGAIN ON AND FORMING PEOPLE THAT THIS MAY BE A RESOURCE THAT THEY COULD BOTH BE ELIGIBLE FOR AN ACCESS- ADDITIONALLY WE ARE PARTNERING WITH CODE FOR AMERICA ACT WITH THE UPDATED GET CAUGHT GET FRESH APPLICATION ASSISTANCE TOOL AGAIN TO LOOK AT SOME MESSAGING- AND SEE IF WE CAN'T. GET MAKE STILL TAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS WITH THOSE- RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT SO THAT'S JUST AT THE START OF THOSE EFFORTS AGAIN LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MANY PARTNERS ACROSS THE SUN ADDITIONAL WAYS WE CAN GET THIS INFORMATION OUT. TO THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST THANK YOU DIRECTOR BEFORE WE CLOSE OUT THIS PANEL I WILL NOW ASK QUESTIONS OF DIRECTOR KILGORE WITH. THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES- MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY HAS MORE THAN SEVEN BILLION IN UNCOLLECTED CHILD SUPPORT DEBT. MUCH OF IT WHICH IS OWED BY PERSONS EARNING LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AN ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT MUCH OF THIS DEBT IS UNCOLLECTIBLE. HAS THE TIME COME FOR THE STATES TO FORGIVE THIS OLD CHILD SUPPORT THAT DIRECTOR. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND IT WORKED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES NASA THE COLLECTIVE ONLY SAY THAT WAS DONE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IDENTIFIED HE- TOOK A LOOK AT THE AVERAGE BALANCE AN ESTIMATED THAT THAT WOULD BE AT AROUND THIRTY FIVE TO THIRTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS. AT THIS POINT IN TIME RIGHT NOW IT'S SITTING AT EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THERE MANY OF WHICH WERE ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE PRINTER PRACTICE HAS MITIGATED SOME OF THE BUILD UP OF BILLS ARREARS BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S- MORE TO GO THAT ROUTE. AT THAT TIME IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THERE WAS A TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THAT AND CLICK WILL GET OVER THE GOVERNMENT. AND THAT'S DROPPED ON THE SEVEN. NUMBER MY GENERATION. CASE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO KIND OF MANY. THE OF THAT PARTICULAR. BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE STILL MORE DIRECTION CHINKO. WITH REGARD TO THAT PARTICULAR AREA. INTO DEPARTMENTS PROPOSAL FOR THE CAKE BACK IN THE COLLECTABILITY IS TO GET THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIOLOGICAL INSIGHT. INTO WHAT FACTORS INSURANCE EARNED BEST FORECAST THE COLLECTABILITY AMONG THE DEAD. AND WITH THAT INFORMATION THE DEPARTMENT COULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW BEST TO PROPOSED CHANGES. IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE RAIDERS AND- IN THE FUTURE. AT THIS POINT IN TIME THAT WE HAVE NO MECHANISM TO IDENTIFY WHAT'S UNCOLLECTIBLE IN TO REMOVE IT FROM THE BOOKS. THAT'S WHERE WE'LL GET SOME. THANK YOU UP ON QUESTIONS. AT USE OF. LICENSES TO PUNISH PEOPLE FOR THINGS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO PUBLIC SAFETY HAS COME INTO QUESTION. IN RECENT YEARS. AND THERE ARE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT SUSPENDING LICENCES TO RECOVER DEBT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE PEOPLE LOSE JOBS AND INCOME. WHEN THEY CAN'T DRIVE. YET OUR CHILD SUPPORT. PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO USE LICENSE SUSPENSION AS A WAY TO COLLECT THAT. HOW MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY OF LICENSE SUSPENSION DUE TO UNPAID CHILD SUPPORT AND WHAT IS THE TREND OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. SO THE DEBT IS A LITTLE SKETCHY MISTER WE KNOW HOW MANY SUSPENSION REQUEST WE SENT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES- WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SUSPEND WHETHER THEY SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF CHILD SUPPORT BECAUSE OF OTHER MATTERS. IS REALLY UNKNOWN TO US- THAT'S AROUND UP AROUND A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY WE ALSO RELEASE ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT AND AS FAR COLLECTIONS TOOLS THAT. THE DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION IS MORE ABOUT ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CHILD CARE PROGRAM THAN IT IS ABOUT COLLECTIONS WE DO HAVE A STATE WE GET A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT INDICATED. FORTY MILLION DOLLARS COLLECTED PRIOR TO THE DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION AND A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION COLLECTED AFTERWARDS. THERE'S A POPULATION OF BOOKS THAT ARE ON PAINT. THAT ARE IN THE GIG. ECONOMY THAT ARE IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AND THIS IS THE ONLY MECHANISM WE HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THEM. BUT I WOULD AGREE THAT THE DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION IS A BIT OF A BLUNT TOOL. AND TO THAT EXTENT I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK AT THIS AND FINE TUNE AND WE'D BE INTERESTED IN. PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SOME. PAPER TO COME UP. THANK YOU. BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT. SUBCOMMITTEE REQUESTS THAT ARE MADE IN THE AGENDA AT THE END OF ISSUE ONE. STARTING AT THE BOTTOMS OF PAGE THIRTY THREE. AND THESE ARE. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ASK THE L. A. O. TO PROVIDE A LIST OF OPTIONS WITH GENERAL FUND COSTS. AND INDICATING WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A ONE TIME OR ONGOING COSTS. FOR SIMPLIFYING ACCESS TO THE CAL WORK PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY. AND TO ALLOW FOR MAXIMUM UTILIZATION OF THE PROGRAM FOR FAMILIES IN NEED. IT IS REQUESTED THAT THIS COME BACK TO THE SUB COMMITTEE BY MID APRIL. TWO WE ASK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE A LIST OF OPTIONS WITH GENERAL FUND COSTS AND INDICATING. WHETHER OR NOT THESE ARE ONE TIME OR ONGOING COSTS. FOR SIMPLIFYING ACCESS TO THE CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM. AND A PROFILE OF WHAT COSTS WOULD MEAN TO MAXIMIZE. EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE STATEWIDE IT IS REQUESTED THAT THIS ALSO COME BACK IN MID APRIL. THREE WE ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS PART OF A REPORT THAT WAS REQUIRED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET. ON THE STATUTORY CHANGES NEEDED TO INSTITUTIONALIZE. THE CALOR. WHICH WAS NOT RECEIVED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CALENDAR YEAR. FOUR WE REQUEST A MORE IN DEPTH INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES ON ITS RESEARCH PROPOSALS AND A SCHEDULE WITH THE CONVERSATIONS TO OCCUR SOON WITH INTEREST INTERESTED LEGISLATIVE STAFF. ON IF AND HOW THESE ISSUES CAN BE RESOLVED AS A PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. APART FROM THESE REQUEST PLEASE KNOW THAT OUR STAFF MAY. ALSO REQUEST FURTHER INFORMATION AFTER THIS HEARING AND AS WE DEVELOP OUR PROPOSALS AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION. BUT CAN I FIRST ASK IF THERE'S ANY FEEDBACK OR REACTION AT THIS TIME FROM THE L. A. O. OR THE ADMINISTRATION REGARDING THESE REQUEST. ADJUSTED PRE INSTALLMENT FINANCE. SO LIKE I SAID JUST GET SOME CLARIFICATION ON- REQUEST NUMBER TWO AND THE WAY THAT I'M UNDERSTANDING IN THIS IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS LOOKING FOR A POTENTIAL OR ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS BEYOND WHAT'S INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RELATED TO THE CONFERENCE PROGRAM AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO COMMENT THAT AT THIS TIME WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS- BEYOND WHAT'S BEEN INCLUDED- TO THE EXTENT I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS IT FIVE THIS ENDS UP BEING A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE. I'D BE HELPFUL THE LAST NO AND TOTAL THROUGHOUT THE- MAYBE GET SOMETHING BACK FROM YOUR OR YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE AGENDA IN TOTAL ON WHAT PRIORITIES THAT YOU'D LIKE US. TO MAYBE LOOK AND SEE IF WE CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL SO ON THEIR THIS QUITE A FEW I REQUEST OF A PROPOSALS. HERE ARE PRIORITIES AND- YEAH KIND OF THE TIME FRAME THAT WERE GOING ON WITH COMING UP WITH A MEMBER VINCE THE WORKING. THE DEPARTMENTS OF FINANCE AND DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING ON. HI I THINK WORKERS. A LITTLE TOO HIGH ON ON BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS EVERY SINGLE PRIORITY. SO I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IT MAY BE ON THINGS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY FOR THAT THE LEGISLATURE. IF YOU CAN LET US KNOW AND THEN MAYBE IF THERE'S THINGS BEYOND THAT IT MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO. OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST COLLEAGUES TO MAYBE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE ISSUES FOR YOU- BOB HAPPY TO CONTINUE THAT DISCUSSION. I AM HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP OFFLINE I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT WITHIN THE AGENDA WE SEE THE NEED FOR THIS- DISCUSSION AND- REALLY WOULD. LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME URGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING IT PRIOR TO THE MAY REVISION. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH PANEL ONE. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON THE PANEL TO ON CURRENT CRITICAL STEPS TOWARDS RACIAL EQUITY. WE WILL HAVE EIGHT PANELISTS FOR ISSUE TO AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH ADRIANA- ALMOST YAMAMOTO. POLICY ANALYST WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. AGAIN WE WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE PRESENTERS HAVEN'T CONCLUDED. MYSTERON MOST YAMAMOTO PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS A DROUGHT AROUND THE STATE A MODEL POLICY ANALYST AT THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. AND I AM HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO KICK OFF THIS INCREDIBLE PANEL ON ADVANCING RACIAL EQUITY. IN A RECENT REPORT CONFRONTING RACISM OVERCOMING COBIT NINETEEN AND ADVANCING HEALTH EQUITY WE PRESENTED AGE ADJUSTED COVERT NINETEEN CASE AND DEATH RATES BY RACE ETHNICITY. AND FOUND THAT NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDER CALIFORNIANS AS WELL AS A LOT NEXT CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF COVERT NINETEEN INFECTION AND DEATH. WE ACTUALLY JUST RECENTLY UPDATED THE CHARTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN TODAY'S AGENDA AND THIS REMAINS UNCHANGED. THESE DISPARITIES ARE ALARMING ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT SOME RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS SUCH AS LIVE NEXT CALIFORNIANS ARE GENERALLY YOUNGER. THAN OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. AS YOU ALL KNOW AGE IS RELEVANT BECAUSE THE RISK FOR SEVERE ILLNESS AND EVEN DEATH FROM COVERT NINETEEN INCREASES AS A PERSON. GETS OLDER OF COURSETHE OTHER MAJOR RISK FACTOR IS HAVING AN UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS HEART CONDITION. ASTHMA OR A WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM AND WE KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES PERSIST IN CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND EVEN MORTALITY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND ASK WHY DO WE SEE RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT POINTS TO THE PURPOSE FULL INTEGRATION OF RACIST POLICIES AND PRACTICES FROM HOUSING TO THE ENVIRONMENT EMPLOYMENT TO HEALTH CARE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO EDUCATION. ALL OF THOSE CONDITIONS IMPACT HEALTH. AND SO THE RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES IN COVERT NINETEEN CASES AND THAT'S CONFIRM WHAT MANY HAVE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED. THAT RACISM IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. LONG STANDING ISSUES OF RACISM EMBEDDED IN EVERY INSTITUTION HAVE PLACED PEOPLE OF COLOR AT A HIGHER RISK OF HARM. FROM COVERT NINETEEN. OUR REPORT INCLUDE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES WHERE FROM THE MOMENT THE POLICY WAS CONCEIVED THE INTENT WAS TO BLOCK BLACK LATIN NEXT AMERICAN INDIAN AND OTHER FAMILIES OF COLOR. FROM HIGH QUALITY HOUSING HEALTHCARE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION AND THE ABILITY TO BUILD GENERATIONAL WEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND DISPLACEMENT ON THE BASIS OF RACE IS DEEPLY INGRAINED IN THE UNITED STATES THAN IN CALIFORNIA. THIS INCLUDES THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT POLICY OF REDLINING PREDOMINATELY PREDOMINATELY BLACK AND LATIN NEXT NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH LED TO THE DENIAL OF MORTGAGES FOR HOMES IN THESE AREAS PREVENTING BOTH INDIVIDUAL ACCESS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP AND NEIGHBORHOOD CAPITAL INVESTMENT FOR BLACK AND LATIN NEXT FAMILIES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE RACIST FEDERAL POLICY THAT BLOCK UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM ACCESSING COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAID I'LL ORDER FOR PURCHASING FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED COVERAGE THROUGH HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACES SUCH AS COVERED CALIFORNIA.% THIS EXCLUSION HAS ALWAYS BEEN HARMFUL BUT IT IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC DURING A PANDEMIC WHAT WE SEE IS THAT LET NEXT CALIFORNIANS REMAIN MORE LIKELY TO BE UNINSURED AND UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS MAKE UP THE LARGEST SHARE OF PEOPLE WHO LACK HEALTH COVERAGE IN THE STATE. THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT DOCUMENTS HOW RACISM PERSISTS IN VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND HOW THAT IMPACTS HEALTH AS WELL AS THE EFFECTIVE EVERYDAY RACIAL DISCRIMINATION OR INTERPERSONAL RACISM ON HEALTH. ALL IN ALL RACIAL USING RACIAL HEALTH INEQUITIES ARE THE RESULT OF POLICYMAKERS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS WITH POWER SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT HAVE CREATED ADVANTAGES FOR WHITE PEOPLE AND HAVE A PRESS TO PEOPLE OF COLOR. BOLD POLICY ACTION IS NEEDED TO CORRECT THESE AFFECTS DECLARING RACISM AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THAT DIRECTION BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR POLICY MAKERS AND OTHER LEADERS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM WE NEED TO DEFINE IT AND CALIFORNIA HAS YET TO DO THAT ALSO DECLARATIONS ARE OFTEN THE FIRST STEP IN PROMPTING POLICY ACTION. AND THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES. ON A FINAL NOTE WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE SAME CALIFORNIA OR NORMAL BECAUSE THAT WAY OF LIFE WAS NOT WORKING FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR. STATE LEADERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA WITH ANTI RACIST POLICIES THAT VALUE THE LIFE OF EVERY CALIFORNIAN AND ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE HEALTHY AND THRIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM MARCO ME JACK DEPUTY SECRETARY PROGRAM AND FISCAL AFFAIRS CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY MARCO. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR POSTING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND BITING ME CERTAINLY TO BE PART OF THAT OUT BEFORE I BEGAN I DO WANT TO EXPAND- AT LEAST FROM OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY FAMILY INCLUDING OUR DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES. OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO WERE MURDERED YESTERDAY TO LANA. AND I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST EIGHTY THAT ASIAN AMERICANS ARE ASIAN AMERICAN FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS IN CALIFORNIA. HE CAN'T PREVAIL I AM THAT WE SEE WHEN WE MUST WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE SAFE. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU'RE IN A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE FABRIC OF OUR STATE. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT AT THE END OF THIS WEEK WE WILL BE. APPROACHING THE ONE YEAR MARK OF WHEN THE GOVERNOR ISSUED THE STATE HOME ORDER RELATED TO COVER NINETEEN. AND A LOT HAS CHANGED OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR AND WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT SOME OF THOSE PIECES. I THINK THIS IS BEEN A DIFFICULT YEAR FOR MANY OF US AND SO I THINK THAT. HOPEFULLY THERE IS MUCH MORE OPEN AHEAD OF US AND I'M. WE ARE THRILLED AND EXCITED ABOUT. EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO FURTHER MEDIC. THE SPREAD OF THE- MUST HELLO KITTY TO SURE THE WE'RE ACT. TO THE COMPANY. PAXTON WELL. MISTER CHAIRMAN OKAY NINETY. AND THE KIND MAKE REALLY HAVE A- MONSTER HEALTH AND- SEEN AMONG OF. DEMOCRATS ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THIS IS REYES. AND THAT WAS CREATED SOCIAL. ECONOMIC AND HEALTH INEQUITIES CONTRIBUTING TO DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER INFECTION AND MORTALITY RATES FOR BOTH CHRONIC AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES. AND COOPER NINETEEN INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY BLACK AND LATINO AND PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATION. HIGH PREVALENCE OF UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES OBESITY AND HYPERTENSION I'M NOT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF MORE SEVERE OUTCOMES AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST YEAR. AND AS WE LOOK TO OUR RECOVERY WE MUST RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO ENSURING THAT WE'RE BUILDING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. DON'T FURTHER PERPETUATE THESE RACIAL INEQUITIES A LOOK TO ADDRESS THAT. WE ALSO MUST ACT ON THE STRUCTURAL ASPECTS OF OUR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO ENSURE WE ADDRESS THAT ADDRESS INDIVIDUAL AND IMPLICIT BIAS SEES SMOKE ALSO ADDRESSING THE RACIAL INEQUITIES. THEY MIGHT PERPETUATE. AND I WILL LOOK FURTHER WE MUST LOW FOR A APPS IN OR TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IN ORDER PREVENT AB OKAY IN THE FOR PLACE DEMOCRATIC AND IN FACT DISEASE. AMONG ALL OUR BLACK AND BROWN FAMILY NEIGHBORS HOW DO WE DO THIS. I THINK WE SET GROUNDWORK WITH REGARDS OF OUR WORK RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC FROM INSURING THAT TESTING WAS MORE EQUITABLE RELATED TO IT. TIP CODE NUMBER NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COOKING NINETEEN SIMILARLY. WITH VACCINE DISTRIBUTION. I'M A HARD PART ALSO ENGAGE IN OTHER WHICH IS MASTER FOR EACH AND MAKE SURE THEY- AGING IS. EQUITIES PART OF IT AGING COME. OUR MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING CARE OUR HERO HEALTH TASK FORCE THE WORK DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES IS DOWN AROUND CAL WORKS AND THE OUTCOMES AND ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE- BECAUSE OF THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOUNG BACK OUTSIDE RELATED TO CALLIE. AND REALLY LOOK AT WAYS IN WHICH WE- IT WE RE. THE MEDICAID SYSTEM. COLLECTIVELY I THINK WE ARE A LOT MORE WORK AHEAD OF US AND WE AGREED THAT RACISM HAS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE COMMIT OURSELVES AS A GOVERNMENT INSTITUTION TO WORKING WITH YOU AND OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. REDRESSED MANY OF THESE INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TIM JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. DIRECTOR JOHN. THANK YOU CHAIRED MEMBERS CAN JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES NINETY ONE I JUST APPRECIATE AT THAT THE PANEL THE AGENDA AT THIS A COMPONENT. OF THE CONVERSATION AND- WELL ALSO ASKED AND APOLOGIES FROM OUR DIRECTOR OF OFFICE THAT. OFFICE OF EQUITY AB MYSELF A RELEASE WHO'S ACTUALLY WORKING ON IT DRESSINGS AMERICAN EQUITIES. AS WE SPEAK AND UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T BE HERE SO I WILL ALSO COVER AT THE QUESTIONS ADD NEXT IN IN THE AGENDA ON HER SEGMENT. I'M SO START WITH HOW WORKS THE QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO YOU- THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE CALYXT AT POPULATION. THE COW WORKS POPULATION IS PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE JUST SHY OF NINETY PERCENT. THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD AND CAL WORKS IS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD. AND THE AVERAGE ASSISTANT UNIT SIZE IS TWO AND A HALF OF COURSE WE ARE PEOPLE SET USUALLY ENDS UP BEING AN ADULT WITH TWO CHILDREN. AND I AM NOT UNLIKE AS THAT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER OUTLINED. BLACK HISPANIC AND LATINO POPULATIONS ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN CAL WORKS PROGRAMS AS COMPARED TO THE OVERALL STATEWIDE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. THE LET LET NEXTER LATINO POPULATION IS SIXTY ONE AND A HALF PERCENT. OF THE BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION 15% OUT WHITE 18% ASIAN 3% THANKS ANDERSON AFTER AT 2% SO. AGAIN I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WHITE AND ASIAN POPULATIONS ARE UNDER REPRESENTED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE STATE'S POPULATION AND HOW IT WORKS. I'M WHAT I WOULD DO AGAIN TURNING TO A DIRECTOR REASONS QUESTION IN THE AGENDA THAT I'LL COVER HERE WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT IN TERMS OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- IS THINKING ABOUT WHO WE ARE STARVING. OF WHO WE ARE NOT WHOSE REACH TWO IS NOT WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES FOR THOSE THAT ARE SERVED IN BEING ABLE TO DO THINGS LIKE THIS AGGREGATE BY RACE AS AN EXAMPLE. AND THESE ARE KEY COMPONENTS OF THE WORKING ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR OFFICE OF EQUITY. DISPARITIES EXIST NOW THESE THAT EXTRA THAT I JUST OUTLINED TOWER OR NOT UNIQUE AND- THE COW THEY ARE. SIMILAR IF YOU LOOK THE PRO IN OUR WELFARE SPACE. AND OTHERS. I'M WHAT WHAT I WULD SAY IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS THAT WE HAVE HAD THE- PRIVILEGE OF BEING ONE OF TWELVE STATE DEPARTMENTS. ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHO HAS PARTICIPATED IN THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE FOR RACIAL EQUITY EFFORT WHICH REALLY IS GIVING A DEPARTMENT TOOLS RESOURCES. FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING CREATING AMBASSADORS ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT WHO CAN THEN RETURN AND WORK THROUGH AND IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE THOSE SAME TOOLS. I TO OUR STAFF SO WE HAVE THIS IS OUR THIRD YEAR IN THAT EFFORTS- IN AGAIN HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS SUPPORT TO US ALONG THE WAY. ONE OF ONE OF THE WAYS OF BOTH THE OFFICE OF EQUITY AND ALSO BE ESTABLISHED AS A CHIEF DATA STRATEGIST- IN OUR RESEARCH AN AUTOMATION DIVISION IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE SHARING INFORMATION SO. AGAIN TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION AROUND WHO IS BEING SEARCHED AGAIN WHO'S NOT TO THE EARLIER MENTIONED IT TO THE ERLIER EFFORT I MENTIONED OF BEING ABLE TO MAP. OUT AND UNDERSTAND WHO WAS ELIGIBLE NOT HAVING ACCESS THESE ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS AT FOR US TO BE. INTENTIONAL IN OUR STRATEGIES I'M I ALSO SAY THAT- AND AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL IS EFFORTS LIKE THE COWARDS OUTCOMES AND ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW WORK HOW OR- AND THAT IS ESSENTIAL AND CRITICAL RIGHT WHERE WE ARE. AT DETERMINING WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE THAT WE EXPECT FOR OUR PARTICIPANTS BASED ON WHAT PARTICIPANTS ALSO ARE LOOKING TO ACHIEVE AND HAVING THEM ENGAGED IN THE IN THE POLICY SETTING AND PROGRAM DESIGN PROCESS SEES- AND BUT REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE. WORKING TOWARDS THE OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT TO SEE AND NOT. EXCLUSIVELY LOOKING AT FEDERAL METRICS IN THAT PARTICULAR EXAMPLE SO THAT'S AGAIN WORK THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN TOGETHER IN A CRUCIAL AND VERY APPRECIATIVE AND AT THE END OF THE ENGAGEMENT IN THE EFFORT TO GET. TO THOSE OUTCOMES. BUT ALL NOTED THAT- IF AS RELATES TO HOW WE'RE IN A AGAIN TO THE- SPEAKER IN TERMS WHAT STAYING ON OUTCOMES. AND WHO WORKS THE CALYX POPULATION SERVES. A CAREER PATHWAYS ARE CRITICAL- I AM TOO AGAIN GET TO PLACES WHERE WE ARE SUPPORTING. I INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES- IN GIVING TO AT CREATE AND MEET WAGES THAT WILL SUSTAIN THEM- IN THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ONE A HIGHLIGHT I'D MENTIONED IN THE GOVERNOR'S AT BUDGET PROPOSAL IS OUR- A COMPONENT AROUND REMOTE LEARNING AND BEING ABLE TO. USE DIFFERENT. APPLICATIONS AND APPROACHES LIKE SELL AD. THAT IS PROVIDING A OPPORTUNITY RIGHT THERE ON THE CELL PHONE TO GET CONNECTED TO YOU. AT A DIFFERENT SUPPORTS LOCATIONAL TRAINING OPTIONS SENATE COURSES CITIZENSHIP- AND SO AGAIN WE WANT TO USE OPPORTUNITIES AND AGAIN LESSONS LEARNED AROUND HOW REMOTE ACCESS WORKS EVEN TO GET ON TO A CAREER PATHWAY IN THE FORCES ANOTHER PLACE. WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT AND THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY. WITH DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS- AND ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. I'M THE FINAL THAT YOU HAD TO ENDURE AT DIRECTOR REASON SECTION HERE- IS AROUND THE OFFICE OF EQUITY IN START SMOKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE LOOKING OUR VISION HERE LONG TERM AND- WE WANT TO SEE THAT WE- HAD NO MATTER. WHO YOU ARE IN IN IN OUR CALIFORNIA FOR ALL APPROACH THAT EVERYONE CAN REACH THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL OF HEALTH AND POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL LIFE REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND AND IDENTITY AND AT YOUR AT YOUR GENDER OUTLINES SOME OF THE PRIORITIES OF OUR OFFICE AROUND. STARTING WITH US AS WELL WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A CULTURE OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. AGAIN A HUGE PRIORITY AROUND MAKING IN EQUITIES VISIBLE AGAIN THROUGH THE DASHBOARD EXAMPLES THAT I USED PRIOR. AND ALSO HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE IT'S SIMPLIFIED AND UNDERSTANDABLE ATTITUDE TO ANY USER. I'M ALSO AGAIN USING AND DEVELOPING SOME OF THESE TOOLS SO AS WE ARE DEVELOPING POLICY ARE WE NOT ONLY LOOKING AT AT HOW WE'RE DOING THAT THROUGH RACIAL EQUITY LOANS AND AGAIN. AT USING THAT AS DRIVERS BUT ALSO HOW ARE WE CREATING THE POLICY HOW ARE WE ENGAGING AGAIN WITH OUR PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITIES TO. CREATE AND DEVELOP THE POLICIES IN WHICH WE ARE IMPLEMENTING I SPOKE IN A LITTLE BIT TO OUR LANGUAGE ACCESS OUT EFFORTS AND ACCESS FOR COMMUNITIES WITH DISABILITIES I'VE I'VE- LOOK UP MOST RECENTLY. AND SOME OF THE WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING ON OUR STAKEHOLDER SESSIONS WITH THE CHILD CARE TO TRANSITION OF CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. REALLY OFFERING UP MULTIPLE LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION SIMULTANEOUS OFFERING AGAIN ALL THE CLOSED CAPTIONING IN OTHER- TOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT THAT THE INFORMATION WE'RE PROVIDING ACCESSIBLE THAT'S A COMMITMENT THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON. AND AGAIN OUR OFFICE OF THE EQUITY WAS ESTABLISHED WITHIN AT THE AT THE EXISTING PROGRAMS WE START WITH WHAT WE HAD. GRATEFUL FOR WHAT WE HAD EVERYTHING FROM OUR IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION BRANCH IN WORK WHICH IS ESSENTIAL. I'M OUR OFFICE. OF TRIBAL AFFAIRS OUR CIVIL RIGHTS EIGHT- IN THE RACE EQUITY BUT I'M- THAT ARE PART OF WITH THE- ALLY FOR RACE EQUITY SO GIVE. I HAVE SOME FOR TO UPON THAT WERE. MAKE SURE WE HAVE A ROBUST TEAM THAT CAN WORK TO EMBED THESE PRINCIPLES ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION NO MATTER WHAT PROGRAM. AND I GIVEN ORGANIZATIONAL DIVISION IS WORKING ON THAT THIS IS HOW WE APPROACH AND DO BUSINESS SAYS THAT AS AS A MATTER AB- WORKING WITH ALL SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DIRECTOR JOHNSON NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KIM MCCOY WADE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING. THAT AFTERNOON SHARON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS FORUM ON RACIAL EQUITY AT THIS TIME. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF BEIJING WE'RE VERY A PRIVILEGE TO CONVENE THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE SECRETARY AND WHEN WE BEGAN RIGHT AWAY OR STAKEHOLDER SAID IN DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN. EQUITY NEEDS TO BE AT THE HEART OF THIS AND NEEDS TO BE OUR FOCUS. AND SO WE HAD JUST CONVENE AN EQUITY WORKGROUP WHEN INDEED THE PANDEMIC HIT AND THE STAY AT HOME ORDERS CAME. AND UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT AWAY BEGAN TO SEE THE HEALTH INEQUITIES IN ECONOMIC INEQUITIES THAT FACE SO MANY OF OUR OLDER CALIFORNIANS. AND OUR FAMILIES. SO EQUITY WAS BAKED IN THIS YEAR- BROWN ARE STAKEHOLDER SAYS FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE MASTER PLAN AND WE HOPE YOU CAN SEE IT. IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE INITIATIVES THAT WERE ANNOUNCED IN JANUARY YOU ARE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT POLICY AND BUDGET- ITEMS THAT AREN'T ARE INTENDED TO WHICH ADDRESS. AND REMEDY ON A RACIAL DISCRIMINATION I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW. SOME OF THE POLICY THAT YOU SEE GOAL. WHICH IS. ABOUT INCLUSION AND EQUITY AND NOT ISOLATION. ALL CALLS FOR AN EQUITY AN AGING ADVISORY TASK FORCE TO. CONTINUE AND IN FACT WE HAD OUR FIRST MEETING YESTERDAY SO IT IS THE FIRST OF THE IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEES A MASTER PLAN FOR AGING UNDERWAY INAPPROPRIATELY FOCUSED ON EQUITY- AND WE FOCUSED ON VACCINES. AND DIGITAL DIVIDE TO TOP OF MIND ISSUES WHERE THERE ARE- CONTINUE TO BE EQUITY ISSUES IN CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT TO SERVE ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE ALSO CONTINUE OUR EQUITY AN AGING WEB IN OUR SERIES WHICH IS AIMED AT HELPING OUR PROVIDERS. GROW IN THEIR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AND EQUITY OUR LAST OF THIS MONTH WE HEARD FROM LEADERS IN SERVING ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER ELDERS. AND NEXT MONTH WE CONTINUE ALL WITH LATINO. ELDERS AND SO WE ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO INCREASING OUR COMPETENCY AND MOVING FORWARD OUR DATA COLLECTION AND- MOVING MONEY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. AND THE THIRD THING I WOULD JUST SAY IS A LECTURER JOHNSON AT CDSS DEPARTMENT OF AGING HAS JOINED THERE AS WELL THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE FOR RACIAL EQUITY AND HAS A TEAM THAT IS COMING TOGETHER D. E. I. PLAN FOR CDA. LOOKING AT OUR TRAINING HIGH OR- ULTIMATELY OUR SERVICE NETWORK IN OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE BUDGET I TO OTHER POLICY ITEMS RATHER. AND I WOULD JUST PREVIEWED VERY EARLY- WE'RE LOOKING NOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND ARE TWENTY GENERAL'S OFFICE. ABOUT CONVENING THE ELDER JUSTICE COORDINATING COUNCIL. AND OUR INITIAL CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY. INTENTIONAL ABOUT DOING THAT WITH A TRAUMA INFORMED IN A RACIAL JUSTICE BORDERLANDS SO MORE TO COME ON THAT NEXT TIME WE TALK I'M SURE. ON THE BUDGET JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE ITEMS IN. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET- THAT FAR INTO THE DRESSING AGING AND WERE YOU CAN SEE- EFFORTS TO ADDRESS RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AS WELL. FIRST IS THE NO WRONG DOOR WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR OLDER ADULTS AND FAMILIES. TO GET INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES AND SO BUILDING OUT A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM THAT'S CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND HAS LINGUISTIC- ACCESS BOTH ON MULTIPLE SPOKEN LANGUAGES AS WELL AS A CELL WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU SEE THAT IN THE BUDGET. PROPOSED WE ALSO SEE THE GERIATRIC CARE WORK FORCE WE NEED MANY MANY MORE GERIATRICIANS AND PEOPLE KNOWLEDGEABLE GERIATRIC MEDICINE ACROSS THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND A DIVERSIFIED PIPELINE TO THAT SO YOU SEE THAT A PROPOSAL AS WELL. BETTER SISTER DEPARTMENT AT OSTAD. AND THEN THERE'S A BOLD ALZHEIMER'S PACKAGES WELL. THAT'S SPECIFICALLY SINGLES OUT. THE DISPARATE IMPACT OF THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE ITSELF ON FAMILIES OF COLOR AND WOMEN OF COLOR- BUT ALSO THE CAREGIVING BURDEN THAT FALLS TO BLACK WOMEN IN WHICH YOU KNOW WOMEN. IN PARTICULAR. AND SO YOU SEE INVESTMENTS PROPOSED FOR RESEARCH OR CARE GIVING TRAINING FOR PUBLIC. AWARENESS- AND MORE. THOSE ARE JUST A FEW THE BUDGET ITEM THAT ARE BOTH TARGET AGING IN THE- ALITY. REYES AND RACE. YOU ALSO ASK ABOUT HOW DID HOW TO DECIDE ON. WELL- OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE'VE BEEN INFORMED BY BOTH THE ENTIRE CABINET WORK GROUP ONE VERY PLEASED THAT BY THE END OF THE PROCESS ALL SECRETARIES WERE ENGAGED- INCLUDING FOOD AND AG AND CORRECTIONS ALL WHICH WAS TERRIFIC WE ALSO HAD A ROBUST A COLDER PROCESS WITH. OVER A HUNDRED STAKEHOLDERS ON MULTIPLE COMMITTEES AND WE HAD A SERIES OF LEGISLATIVE ROUNDTABLES A VERY GRATEFUL TO THE MEMBERS WERE ABLE TO HELP OUR HOST THOSE WORKING PERSON AND REMOTELY. SO THAT LEFT US WITH A LOT OF PRIORITIES AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE INFORMED BY BY BOTH THE EQUITY GROUP TO BEGIN MEETING YESTERDAY. AND WE ARE ABOUT TO SET THE TABLE FOR A NEW UP MASTER PLAN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE IF YOU WELL I HOPE TO GET THAT LAUNCH THIS SPRING AS WE CONTINUE TO EMERGE. FROM THE HEALTH EMERGENCY INTEND. I LOOK TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO BILLS FOR WORK. REALLY PUT THE QUESTION ON DAY AND MET TO WORK VERY. TO BUILD MEASURABLE PROGRESS INTO THE MASTER PLAN AND I WOULD SAY YOU'LL SEE RACIAL EQUITY MEASURES IN TWO MAIN WAYS. AT THE HIGH LEVEL THERE ARE FIVE GOALS THAT ARE LAID OUT. FOR A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AGES. TO APPROACH EXPLICITLY ADDRESS RACIAL INEQUITY ONE AROUND LIFE EXPECTANCY. ARE PART OF IT CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AGES WILL BE INCREASING LIFE EXPECTANCY AND AN END TO THE RACIAL AND GENDER GAP- WHICH AGAIN TRAGICALLY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY COULD PARTICULARLY. IN BLACK LATINO AND SOME SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITIES AS WELL- AND SO GETTING BACK ON TRACK AND CLOSING THE GAP ON LIFE EXPECTANCY IS ONE OF THE MAJOR GOALS. THE OTHER IS ELDER ECONOMIC SITUATION SYMMETRIC PIONEERED BY PROFESSOR STEVE WALLACE AT UCLA. WE CONTINUE TO SEE A LEGACY OF DISCRIMINATION SHOW UP IN. OLDER AGE. ARE THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES WHETHER IT'S AN HOME EQUITY OR IN SAVINGS OR PENSION. TO AFFORD A HEALTHY AND THRIVING. ON AGING AND SO. HOW WE BOTH MAKE SURE THAT ALL ELDERS HAVE ENOUGH ECONOMIC SUFFICIENCY AND WE CLOSE THAT GAP. BETWEEN RACES AND GENDERS SO THAT ALL CAN THRIVE IN THEIR LATER YEARS. ARE TO THE HIGH LEVEL GOALS AND THEN JUST BRIEFLY BEHIND THAT THE MASTER PLAN ITSELF. THERE'S AN ENTIRE DATA DASHBOARD FOR AGING WHICH WE WERE PLEASED TO DEMO FOR LET'S STAFF IN RECENT WEEKS. THAT HAS A DOZENS OF INDICATORS BEHIND THE FIVE BAGELS IN THE TWENTY THREE STRATEGIES AND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THE SCHOOL TO BE BROKEN OUT. BY COUNTY BY RACE BY AGE BAIL 607-080-9000 ARE ALL VERY DIFFERENT. BY GENDER AND THEN INCREASINGLY WE NEED TO DO BETTER ON L. G. B. T. Q. DATA. AND DISABILITY DATA SO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT THERE BUT I RECOGNIZING THAT KNOWING HOW CALIFORNIA. AT THE STATE LEVEL IS ONE THING BUT KNOWING HOW ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ARE MOVING FORWARD. IS CRITICAL TO MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER. THANK YOU DIRECTOR NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ANGELES SHORTS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS ANGELES SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OF THE FIRST POINT THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS TODAY IS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF INITIATIVES FROM THE NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION REGARDING RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY. SINCE PRESIDENT BIDEN TOOK OFFICE HE HAS SIGNED MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE EXECUTIVE ORDERS MEMORANDUMS AND OTHER ACTIONS. THAT HAVE EITHERA PRIMARY GOAL OF THE FINANCING EQUITY OR INCLUDE. SOME SIGNIFICANT EQUITY PROVISIONS THE TOPICS OF THESE DIRECTIVES RANGE FROM IMPLEMENTING OVERALL FEDERAL APPROACHES TO EQUITY IN A CENTRALIZED MANNER. TO COMBATING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PARTICULAR RACIAL GROUPS. TO INSURING AND- AND ADVANCING EQUITY ACROSS HOUSING COLEMAN NINETEEN RELIEF AND RECOVERY EDUCATION HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. CERTAINLY WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO DISCUSS ALL OF THOSE IN DEPTH TODAY BUT I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE EXECUTIVE ORDER IN PARTICULAR. WHICH PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED ON JANUARY TWENTIETH ON ADVANCING RACIAL EQUITY AND SUPPORTING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- AND I HIGHLY ORDER BECAUSE IT REALLY AIMS TO PUT IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL FAIR FRAMEWORK. ACROSS ALL AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS FOR IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS BARRIERS THAT PREVENT A FULL AND EQUAL PARTICIPATION AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED OR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- AND NOTABLY THE ORDER DEFINES THOSE COMMUNITIES TO INCLUDE PEOPLE OF COLOR. AS WELL AS RELIGIOUS MINORITIES LGBTQ INDIVIDUALS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES APPLE'S LIVE IN RURAL AREAS. AND A PERSON'S OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PERSISTENT POVERTY OR INEQUALITY. THE WORST THANK YOU TO. FOR DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ALL WITHIN ONE YEAR OR LESS INCLUDING IDENTIFYING BEST PRACTICES FOR ASSESSING BARRIERS REPORTING ON BARRIERS AND THEN DEVELOPING PLANS TO ADDRESS THOSE BARRIERS- ALL WITH- CENTRALIZED FOR NATION. THE EXACT ORDER FURTHER MANDATES THAT ALL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES CONSULTS WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED UNDERSERVED OR DISCRIMINATED AGAINST I FEDERAL POLICIES AND PROGRAMS AND THEN FINALLY THE ORDER NOTES THAT MANY FEDERAL FEDERAL. ARE NOT DISAGGREGATED BY RACE ETHNICITY GENDER DISABILITY INCOME OR OTHER KEY DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES- AND TO ADDRESS THAT ESTABLISHES AN EQUITABLE DATA WORKING GROUP TO RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS FOR FEDERAL DATA COLLECTION. SO BEYOND THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER IN GENERAL THE OTHER TWO DOZEN PLUS EXECUTIVE ACTIONS SIMILARLY INCLUDE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF- CONVENING EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO STUDY AN ISSUE IDENTIFY SPECIFIC POLICIES THAT MAY PRESENT BARRIERS. ALSO INVOLVING- SOME SORT OF DATA ANALYSIS FOR SYSTEMS LEVEL REVIEW OF POLICIES AND REGULATIONS AND THEN FINALLY- NEARLY ALL OF THE ACTIONS ALSO INSTRUCTED DEPARTMENTS OR AGENCIES WERE SPECIFIED WORK GROUPS THAT ARE NEWLY CREATED TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS- TO THE PRESIDENT TO IMPROVE ACCESS- WILL REDUCE BARRIERS TO EQUITABLE PARTICIPATION AND OUTCOMES. UP MOVING ON THE NEXT QUESTION WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS THIS IF THERE ARE ANY STATE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NATURAL CANDIDATES FOR FOCUSED ON THE WORK- TOWARD ADDRESSING EQUITY WITHIN HUMAN SERVICES- SO WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE RACIAL DISPROPORTION AUDI'S AND DISPARITIES ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT HUMAN SERVICE PROGRAMS AREAS- AND WE KNOW THAT THESE DISPARITIES MAY MANIFEST. AS AN EQUAL ACCESS TO FULL PARTICIPATION OR TO BENEFITS. OR THEY MAY MANIFEST AS OVER REPRESENTATION OF CERTAIN POPULATIONS FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO FAMILIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY INVOLVED WITH THE CHILD WELFARE AND FOSTER CARE SYSTEMS- AS AN OFFICE. WE ARE THE ONLY- ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO EXPLORE EQUITY IN TERMS OF RACE BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF INCOME GEOGRAPHY AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS. MORE COMPREHENSIVELY REALLY ACROSS ALL WORK INCLUDING HUMAN SERVICES AND ACCORDINGLY IT WILL BE SEEKING- OVER ALL TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT SYSTEMIC PROGRAMMATIC OR HISTORIC BARRIERS OR OTHER DISCRIMINATORY FACTORS ARE DRIVING THESE DISPARITIES AND DISPROPORTIONAL USE THAT WE SEE. ACROSS HUMAN SERVICES AND WE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS WORK. AND THEN FINALLY A THIRD OF THE THIRD POINT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS IS TO PROVIDE OUR ASSESSMENTS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S EQUITY FOCUSED- BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS. WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- AND HE'S PROPOSALS ARE DESCRIBED IN YOUR AGENDA ON PAGES FORTY FIVE THREE FORTY SEVEN SO I WON'T- DESCRIBE THEM IN DETAIL. WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL'S THEMSELVES BUT WE DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO ENSURE THAT SPECIFIC EQUITY FOCUSED PROJECTS WITHIN INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS OR AGENCIES. ARE REALLY COMPLEMENTARY- AND EMPLOYING LESSONS LEARNED FROM ONE ANOTHER RATHER THAN BEING DUPLICATIVE OF ONE ANOTHER. SO TO THAT END- AND ALSO GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE'S OVERALL INCREASED INTEREST IN EXAMINING AND ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO EQUITABLE ACCESS PARTICIPATION REALLY ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT STATE PROGRAMS. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER THE TRADEOFFS OF DEVELOPING A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND CENTRALIZED STATE LEVEL EFFORT EQUITY FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY- AS OPPOSED TO FUNDING INITIATIVES WITHIN INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES OR DEPARTMENTS WITHOUT FIRST HAVING A STRATEGY IN PLACE. AND OF THE LEGISLATURE DOES WANT TO DEVELOP SUCH A STATE LEVEL STRATEGY WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE FIRST TO REALLY SPEND SOME TIME CONSIDERING THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM IT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THROUGH EQUITY INITIATIVES AND TO LAY OUT SPECIFIC GOALS AND THEN- TO THOSE GOALS. OF DIRECT ALL AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENTS TO ACT ACCORDINGLY TO THE STRATEGY- AND I'LL STOP THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS CATHARINE MCDONNELL TOGETHER FROM CEDAR BDA. ACHIEVING RACIAL JUSTICE DIVERSITY AND EQUITY IN OUR PROGRAMS AND SINCE IT NEVER AGAIN PAUL HERSEY WTA STAFF AND OUR MEMBER AGENCIES. MANY OF OUR COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES. OUR OWN STAFF HAVE COME TOGETHER TO LEARN ABOUT UNCONSCIOUS BIAS AS WELL AS STRATEGIES FOR OVERCOMING OUR OWN BIAS SEES AND HOW TO INTERVENE IN MOMENTS AND WE OBSERVE BIAS BEING DISPLAYED FOR OTHERS. AT RECENTLY THE MEDIA CONFERENCES WE HOSTED NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED SPEAKERS ON RACIAL TRAUMA AND EQUITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS WORKING TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN ORGANIZATION. WE HAVE A STAFF AS WELL AS AN ASSOCIATION SUPPORTING HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES OTHER INDIVIDUALS THEY SERVE. DON'T BE OF THIS WORK IS BEING DONE NOW THAT WE'VE HAD SOME TRAINING AND CONFERENCE SESSIONS IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE YOU CHECK A BOX. AND SAY YOU FIXED IT. RATHER THAN HAVE IT REQUIRES US TO OWN AND ACTIVELY WORK TO OVERCOME THE RACES CLASS AND MORALISTIC. OF THE PROGRAM'S ARE MEMBERS ADMINISTER. AS WELL AS THE UNDERLYING. ECONOMIC INJUSTICE STRUCTURES THAT INFLUENCE THESE PROGRAMS. IT MEANS CALLING OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM AND BIAS AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES PEOPLE WHO GROW UP IN OUR LIVE IN POVERTY. PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND MORE. AND IT DEFINITELY MEANS CALLING OUT AND CONFRONTING OUR OWN BY IS TO. ALL OF THE FED THERE ARE CONCRETE THINGS WE HAVE TO STAY TO DO TO BEGIN ADDRESSING. RACISM A LACK. WE MUST COLLECTIVELY EXAMINE OUR PROGRAM AND POLICIES TO AN EQUITY LENS AND ELIMINATE POLICIES THAT ARE BORN OUT OF STRUCTURALLY. WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE EMPHASIS SO MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS PLACE ON COMPLIANCE ABOVE ALL ELSE IS ITSELF A RACIST. THERE ARE BARRIERS TO EXPECTING HER PROGRAMS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER SOMEONE IS ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE. THE PAPERWORK RELATED BARRIERS DISCUSSED DURING PANEL ONE STEM FROM RACES AND CLASSES IDEAS ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE IN LINE. CONTROLLING AND PUNISHING. THEM AND SOMETIMES FREEZING THEM OUT ENTIRELY. UNFORTUNATELY SERVICES SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS HAS ALWAYS FOR THE FOR SOME FOLKS. WE HAVE FOR CHANGES AND YEARS IN AT CORRECTING THAT'S- ALLEGATION FAMILIES DIFFERENTLY TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY ARE. AND WHAT HELP THEY WANT AND NEED RATHER THAN TELLING THEM WHAT. WE THINK THEY NEED FROM US. HERE'S A FEW EXAMPLES OF SOME SUCCESSES WE'VE HAD AND SOME AREAS FOR CRITICALLY ADDITIONAL WORK IN THIS AREA. TOGETHER WE ELIMINATED THE HORRIBLY RACIST CLASSIST AND MISOGYNISTIC MAXIMUM FAMILY GRANT ROLE AND CAL WORKS. AS WELL AS ELIMINATING AFTER TAX AND SETTING UP FOR HER GRANT LEVELS THAT SHOULD ENSURE NO CHILD WAS BELOW 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IN THE PROGRAM. SHE HERE ALSO DEVELOPING HOW WORKS TWO POINT OH APPROACH IN WHICH OUR STAFF ENGAGE OUR RECIPE OF GOAL SETTING. RATHER THAN FOCUS ON COME. WITH WORKERS. I IN FUNDING THIS OF GOAL WAY TOWARD THE HEALTH PROGRAM WORKS FOR AND WITH FAMILIES. WE SHOULD CONTINUE CAL AID PARENTS WHEN THEY'RE TO ARE PLAY IN THE FALL CARE AND THEY WORKING TO REUNIFY. WITHOUT THE SUPPORT PARENTS ON THE RISK AND EVEN HOW. WHICH MEANS A MUCH FLORIDA OF BRINGING. IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY QUALIFY UP RIGHT NOW HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN FAMILIES WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO REUNIFY. AND MORE QUICKLY AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. WE ALSO SUPPORT CHANGES TO THE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM FOR POTENTIAL FOSTER CARE GIVERS AND ITEMS THAT. PROVIDERSALL IN PARTICULAR IN CHILD WELFARE THE UNDERLYING RACISM AND EQUITY OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. RESULT IN MANY PEOPLE OF COLOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND PEOPLE IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY IN PARTICULAR HAVING. CRIMINAL RECORDS FOR QUESTIONABLE AND INEQUITABLE CHARGES FROM THEIR PAST. THIS OFTEN MAKES COUNTIES UNABLE TO APPROVE RELATIVES TO CARE FOR FOSTER CHILDREN. DUE TO A LONG LIST OF STATUTORILY ON EXAMPLE CRIMES. THAT HAS NOT BEEN REVIEWED USING A CRITICAL EQUITY LANDS. WE DURING THE ANTI RECIDIVISM ORGANIZATIONS GROUPS SUPPORTING CURRENT AND FORMER PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN. AND OTHER CHILD WELFARE ADVOCATES TO CALL FOR A RE EXAMINATION OF THESE POLICIES. AND HOW THEY CAN RESULT IN CHILDREN MISSING OUT ON OTHERWISE SAFE AND LOVING PLACE. OR WITH FAMILY MEMBERS. WE ALSO HAVE A THING. CHILD WELFARE FOR EARLIER PREVENTION SERVICES. TO BE UNDERTAKEN IN COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM I WILL SPEAK TO THIS IN GREATER DETAIL ON A LATER PANEL. AT THE STATE LEVEL WE ARE GLAD THAT CDS THAT'S CREATED THE OFFICE OF EQUITY THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT. THROUGH THIS OFFICE AND THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF DIRECTOR JOHNSON WE THINK THAT CDS ASKING PLAYE LEADERSHIP ROLE IN REVIEWING STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES. AND THE UNDERLYING MOTIVATIONS FOR THOSE POLICIES WORKING WITH THE WTA ARE MEMBERS ADVOCATES IN INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE RECEIVING SERVICES THERE ARE PROGRAMS. WE URGE THAT DIVERSE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE NOT JUST THE PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE MOST OFTEN HEARD FROM. AND OF COURSE WE SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO REPLACE ALL THEIR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO EXAMINE AND CONSIDER FURTHER ACTIONS SUCH AS THOSE LISTED IN THE ENGINE. IN CLOSING OUR MEMBERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS AND THIS IS A LONG HAUL COMMITMENT. WE ARE SORRY SOMETIMES GOING TO HEAR AND LEARN THINGS THAT MAKE US REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE. BUT THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE WORK BEFORE US DIGGING INTO THESE DISCUSSIONS. AND MAKING THAT LONG HAUL COMMITMENT TO LEARNING. SELF EXAMINATION AND DOING BETTER WAY BETTER WILL LEAD TO THE GREATEST CHANCE FOR CHANGE. AND FINALLY I ALSO WANT TO URGE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD FOR THESE BOTH TOGETHER. WILL BE CAREFUL NOT TO FORCE THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE DISCRIMINATIONS. AND THE TRAUMA THAT COMES WITH THAT. BE THE ONES TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF CHANGE ON THEIR OWN TAX. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO SHARE THESE THOUGHTS. THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FOR MY CARROLL WITH WEST CENTER MON POVERTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY SPEAKING OUT ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. YOU KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THE WESTERN CENTER HAS- FOCUSED ON FOR MANY YEARS NOW- AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT WORK BUT YOU KNOW I WANT TO START TODAY BY JUST. FOCUSING ON THE- SORT OF HISTORICAL- ROOTS OF HOW WE GOT HERE- YOU KNOW. YOU ONE CAN ACTUALLY TRACE THE ROOTS OF THIS BACK TO ELIZABETHAN ENGLAND. WHEN THEY ADOPTED WHAT WAS THE SO CALLED SETTLED LAWS WHICH WERE ENACTED TO DENY PERSONS PARRIS RELIEF THE OLD OLD VERSION OF WELFARE PAYMENTS. IF THEY DID NOT COME FROM THE AREA SURROUNDING THE PARISH. SO THIS WAS DONE IN EXACTLY THE TIME WHEN- AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS- AFTER AN IMMIGRANT POPULATION WAS GROWING IN ENGLAND AND WAS- WAS VIEWED AS A WAY TO TRY TO DENY THEM SYSTEMS THAT ONLY A NATIVE BORN. ENGLISH PEOPLE COULD GET. ON INDEED MANY OF THE FEATURES OF OUR MODERN WELFARE STATE TO THIS TIME. INCLUDING CHILD SUPPORT WORK WORK WORK REQUIREMENTS SANCTIONS. AN ACID TEST. ON HOWEVER HAD MADE OWN CAR BE TO A RACIST WALL FOR PAUL. I WOULDN'T REALLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE READ- A PIECE CALLED THE RACES RUDE OF WORK REQUIRED BY LEESON OFF WHO'S WITH US FOR THE STUDY OF POLICY- HER ANALYSIS TRACES BACK THE USE OF WORK REQUIREMENTS TO THE JIM CROW ERA WHEN FORMER SLAVES WERE FREQUENTLY ARRESTED THAT THEY COULD NOT PROVE THEY HAD A JOB AND THEN FORCED TO WORK FOR FREE TO PAY OFF THE FINES IMPOSED BY COURTS FURTHER SUPPOSE IN VACANCY. IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT WHITE POLITICIANS BEGAN TO PROMOTE THE MYTH THAT BLACK PEOPLE WERE LAZY AND WOULD NOT WORK EVEN THOUGH FOR MANY BLACKS THERE FOR MANY BLACKS. THEIR ENTIRE EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA HAD BEEN ONE OF CONSTANT WORK ON BEHALF OF WHITES. ON NOT TOO LONG AFTER SOME STATES BEGAN TO CREATE WERE CALLED MOTHER'S PENSION PROGRAMS THESE ARE PREDECESSORS THAT OUR MODERN WELFARE PROGRAMS AND IN IN THE UNITED STATES BLACK MOTHERS WERE ROUTINELY DENIED ASSISTANCE AND TO COMPEL THEM TO HAVE TO WORK USUALLY IN THE FEELS WHEN OF FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT AND THE AND CONGRESS CREATED THE FIRST NATIONAL FAMILY EIGHT PROGRAM AID TO DEPENDENT CHILDREN. ALSO THE STATES NINE TO AID TO WHEN LEAVE THEM NO ALTERNATE BUT WORK FOR ME I'LL WAIT. SO WHAT WE SEE IN THIS BILL LOS RESEARCH IS A CONSISTENT. PATTERN OF USING THE LAW TO FORCED BLACK PEOPLE TO WORK ON AGAINST OFTEN AGAINST THEIR OWN BEST INTERESTS. SO WE NEED TO BE YOU LAWS THAT CURRENTLY IN FORCE WORKING GROUP WORK ARMAND'S WITH DEEP SUSPICION- IN MY GREAT AUNT FORTY YEARS LIKE. OF ANTI POVERTY WORK I'VE STILL YET TO NEED. THE SO CALLED WELFARE. HERE THESE P. DON'T. PEOPLE TO THEIR LIVES THEY WANT TO GET THEY WANT TO HAVE MORE INCOME THEY WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN TO THE BEST YOU GREET IT WE CAN. NONETHELESS WE CONTINUE TO SEE PROPOSALS IMPOSING WORK REQUIREMENTS ON RECEIPT OF PUBLIC BENEFITS WITH THE MOST RECENT ATTEMPTS TO DENY HEALTH CARE TO THOSE WHO DO NOT MEET WORK REQUIREMENTS- THANKFULLY THE BY DEMONSTRATIONS ROLLING BACK THOSE PROPOSALS. ON AND WE SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF OUR OWN HISTORY OF RACIST POLICIES LIKE THE SENATE ONLY JUST MEANT SETTLING JUST MENTION. LIKE THE MAXIMUM FAMILY GRANT. OR ARE LONG- ENFORCEMENT OF. THE DRUG OKAY- AN EXCLUSION FOR BOTH FRESH AND HOW WORKS APPLIQUE. THANKFULLY ALL OF THESE HITTING PAUL HAVE BEEN REPEAT IN RECENT YEARS BY LUNCH. BUT THEY STOOD FOR DE. ARMIN VAN PARTICULARLY. AFRICAN AND LATINO FAMILIES. ON SO WE HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT WE COULD DO- THAT WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE WITH OUR HOURS PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR- ONE IS. WE REALLY WOULD ARGUE THAT SUPPORT THE NOTION TO ABANDON THE PRESCRIPTIVE NATURE OF TAMPA. YOU'VE HEARD THIS MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES BY DIFFERENT SPEAKERS TODAY YOUR I THINK HEARING WHAT IS A GROWING CONSENSUS ABOUT THE NEED TO DO THIS BUT- WE'RE ACTUALLY ARGUING THAT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD ELIMINATE THE ARBITRARY FIVE YEAR TIME LIMIT. BECAUSE THESE TIME LIMITS FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE ECONOMY THAT ENDED THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE NO CONTROL OVER SO IT'S GREAT IF YOU WANT TO WELL NOT GREAT BUT IT A FIVE YEAR TIME LIMIT JUST DOESN'T WORK. IN AN ECONOMY BURKE JUST IN THE PAST DECADE WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO DEEPER SESSIONS AND SEEM THOUSAND MILLIONS OF JOBS GO AWAY SOME OF THESE JOBS WILL NEVER COME BACK. AND THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN SO I THINK THE STATE NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT CAN DO TO ELIMINATE TIME LIMITS ON EIGHT ALTOGETHER BY EXTENDING OUT STATE PAYMENTS TO FAMILIES WHO EXCEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ON CURRENT LAW PROHIBITING PAYMENTS BEYOND SIXTY MONTHS TWO ADULTS. ON YOU KNOW SANCTIONS WERE BARBARIC TOOL IN ELIZABETHAN ENGLAND SOME OF THE PRACTICES I CAN'T EVEN. REPEAT FOR THIS AUDIENCE THEY WERE SO. S. ON AND WHILE OUR PRACTICE DON'T. INCLUDE THOSE SAME THINGS TODAY I'M DIEM. ARE OFF DAMAGE ON. COMPELLING PEOPLE DO WHAT WE THINK THEY SHOULD DO WILL NEVER BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY- WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT SANCTIONS. PRINCIPALLY RESULT IN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. AND THAT THAT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA IS BEING MANDATED BY US BY OUR OWN LAWS AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE REALLY NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM- YES THE FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES US TO HAVE A SANCTION POLICY BUT IT DOESN'T TELL US HOW THAT HAS TO BE ENFORCED. IT MIGHT BE WELL PAST TIME WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR TAKE A REAL HARD LOOK AT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING IF NOT ELIMINATING THE USE OF SANCTIONS. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. NO OE SIZE FITS ALL WORK REQUIREMENTS NEED TO BE REPLACED BY HUMAN CENTERED AND FAMILY FRIENDLY FRIENDLY PLANTS THAT CENTER THE NEEDS OF THE FAMILY AND NOT THE NEEDS OF THE STATE OR SOMEBODY WHO THINKS. THEY KNOW BETTER FOR FAMILIES WHAT THEIR THEIR NEEDS ARE- WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING MORE EDUCATION AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT BY FIVE FAMILIES. THE DATA POINTS TO THIS CONCLUSIVELY AS THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR FOLKS TO GET OUT OF POVERTY. AGAIN WE SHOULDN'T MANDATE THAT WE SHOULD MAKE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION IF THEY NEED TO- WE WOULD STRONGLY. RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CDSS WORKGROUP THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BY DIRECTOR JOHNSON BY MISS CENTRELINK AND OTHERS HERE TODAY I THINK THE pTOO. WE THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD IDEAS THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF CONSENSUS AMONG THE GOALS IN OUT THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THE REPORTS. AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO ADOPT MANY OF THOSE DURING THIS I'M- COMING BUDGET- LASTLY ARE I SHOULD ALSO SAY WELL WE THE THAT'S OUT POWER AND WILL BE GETTING THAT THE WE FORWARD IN IN FEW YEARS WE REALLY THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO GO FURTHER AND FUND AN EXHAUSTIVE STUDY OF CAL WORKS AND ITS IMPACT THE IMPACT IT'S HAD ON POOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF COLOR. WE BELIEVE A THOROUGH REVIEW WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT MOSTLY THAT HANNAH PROGRAM. WILL BY DESIGN RESULT IN DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVE IMPACTS FOR WOMEN OF COLOR. ON WE THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS DATA THAT WE CAN'T KEEP STICKING OUR HEAD IN THE GROUND. AND ACTING LIKE WE DON'T KNOW THAT MORE FAMILIES WHO ARE. AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO OR BEING SANCTIONED THE WHITE FAMILIES- WE THINK OF AN EXAMINATION OF KEY PROGRAM TENANTS IS NEEDED TO EXPOSE THE FUNDAMENTALLY NEGATIVE OUTCOMES THIS PROGRAM. HAS HAD AND CONTINUES TO PRODUCE. I'M AND THEN FINALLY. UNTIL AND IT CAN BE CHANGED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL COUNTY SHOULD BE IMMUNIZED FROM ANY TOWN A FAMILIES IF THE STATE FAILS FAILS TO MEET WORK PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS. ARM WITHOUT THAT BUT WE'LL SEE IS THAT COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WILL CONTINUE TO FEEL FISCALLY VULNERABLE AND WILL PUT PRESSURE ON THEIR LOCAL PROGRAMS TO GET PEOPLE INTO WORK PRESERVATION MEETING THE WORK THE FEDERAL WORK REQUIREMENTS. SO WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO STEP UP AND TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE BURDEN OF MANAGING ANY CAMERA FAMILIES AND TAKING THEM OFF THE BACK OF COUNTIES BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE ACTION IS REALLY HAPPENING IT'S HAPPENING BETWEEN CLIENTS AND COUNTIES THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT NOTHING'S REALLY GOING TO CHANGE IN THE CURRENT CHANNEL PROGRAM SO LONG AS THE COUNTY'S FEEL THE BURDEN OF. THOSE POTENTIAL PENALTIES COMING ON THEM SO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND. REALLY APPRECIATE THIS GREAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU NEXT WE HEAR FROM ORVILLE THOMAS COVER. AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INSIGHT ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE PREVENTING CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT POPULATION FROM ACHIEVING THEIR CALIFORNIA DREAMS. I LIKE TO USE THE START OF MY TESTIMONY PERIOD FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR ALL THOSE MURDERED IN LAST NIGHT'S SHOOTINGS IN ATLANTA AND AMPLIFY THE NEED TO STOP ANTI A P. I HATE. AND ACTIONS AND ADDRESS ANTI IMMIGRANT SENTIMENTS. THANK YOU. CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT POPULATION HAS EXPERIENCED COVE IT VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER CALIFORNIANS AND WE WILL EXPERIENCE THE RECOVERY IN VERY UNIQUE WAYS. IMMIGRANTS INCLUSIVE OF A LARGE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION. MAKE UP A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS. THESE WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES HAD BEEN EXPERIENCING INCREASED HARDSHIPS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE OF RACIST FEDERAL POLICIES BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. ISSUES LIKE PUBLIC CHARGE INCREASED ICE RAIDS AND ADMINISTRATIVE FREEZES ON VISAS AND OTHER IMMIGRATION STATUS APPLICATIONS RESULTED IN A MASSIVE CHILLING AFFECT HOVERING OVER IMMIGRANT USE. OF PUBLIC BENEFITS. MORALISTS FEARED THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY LABOR CENTER HAS SAID THAT THE CHILLING EFFECT RESULTED IN A DISTANT ROMAN RATE. FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS HIGH AS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. AND THESE WERE FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE LEGALLY AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIANS THROUGH STATE FUNDING. SO IN ADDITION TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES WE HAVE SEEN A REDUCTION IN BENEFIT USAGE FOR FREE FOOD PROGRAMS. HOUSING PROGRAMS AND LEGAL SERVICES. OPEN ADDED ANOTHER LEVEL OF HARM TO IMMIGRANTS BY INSERTING A GOBAL HEALTH PANDEMIC TO A POPULATION THAT WAS ALREADY SUFFERING FROM ADMINISTRATIVE AND CULTURAL BERRIER CALIFIA COMES. IMMIGRANTS ARE ALSO SUFFERING FROM MORE UNDIAGNOSED UNDERLYING CONDITIONS AND COMORBIDITIES THE INCREASE IN DEBTS DUE TO KOBE IS DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER FOR OCCUPATIONS LARGELY FILLED BY IMMIGRANTS. COOKS SAW 60% INCREASE IN MORTALITY DURING THE PANDEMIC COMPARED TO PRE PANDEMIC MISCELLANEOUS AB WORKERS SAW 55% INCREASE CONSTRUCTION LABOR SELL 49% INCREASE AND DOMESTIC WORKERS SUCH AS MAIDS AND HOUSEKEEPERS SAW A 33% INCREASE IN DEATH. DURING THE PANDEMIC COMPARED TO PRE PANDEMIC. TURNING TO THE NORM OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. WE KNOW MORE NOW ABOUT WHAT GAPS WERE AND ARE PRESENT IN THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND WE NEED TO DO MORE IN TERMS OF BENEFITS PROVIDED TO GIVE EVERY CALIFORNIANS. REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULFILL THEIR PROMISE. THE CURRENT CAMPAIGNS TOWARD EQUITY I WILL SPEAK ABOUT INVOLVED ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN HEALTH AND PUBLIC BENEFITS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND LEGAL SERVICES AND OUTREACH. CIBC IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT EVERY CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. IN THAT EFFORT WE ARE PUSHING FOR AN EXPANSION OF STATE FUNDED MEDICAL TO ALL THOSE THAT QUALIFY FOR IT. CURRENTLY WE HAVE TWO BILLS TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE SB FIFTY SIX BY SENATOR THE RUSSELL WOULD EXPAND MEDICARE COVERAGE TO ALL SENIORS SIXTY FIVE PLUS WHO QUALIFY REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. AB FOUR BY YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER ARAMBULA WOULD BUILD OFF OF THAT AND EXPAND MEDICARE COVERAGE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO QUALIFIED. REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX. THIS WOULD BUILD OFF OF PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGNS TO EXPAND MEDICARE COVERAGE TO KIDS AND YOUNG ADULTS OBIT NINETEEN AS ALSO INCREASED OUR STATE'S FOOD INSECURITY PROBLEMS WITH DATA SUGGESTING FOOD INSECURITY IN THE STATE. INCREASING BY ALMOST 50% THIS YEAR. CIBC IS ALSO PARTNERING WITH NURSE CALIFORNIA TO PUSH FOR MODERNIZATION OF OUR STATE FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM C. PAP TO ELIMINATE THE BARRIERS OF USAGE BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS. THE NEW RIVER DATO IS AUTHORING SB FOUR SIXTY FOUR TO FUND THE EXPANSION OF FOOD BENEFITS FOR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IN ADDITION TO THAT BILL C. I. PCS SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE CALFRESH OUTREACH EFFORTS BY TWENTY FIVE MILLION THIS YEAR. THIS INVESTMENT WILL RESULT IN DIRECT FEDERAL MATCHING A STATE CONTRIBUTIONS. TO ENSURE THAT IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE SUPPORTED COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC AND ARE PROTECTED FROM FUTURE HEALTH EMERGENCIES CIPC IS SPONSORING A B. SIX TWENTY EIGHT BY EDUARDO GARCIA WHICH WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE STATE'S PREVIOUS BREAKING BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVE. ROCO ALSO COSPONSORING SB THREE TWENTY ONE FROM SENATOR ALSO TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA PROTECTIONS ARE EXPANDED AND PROVIDED TO DOMESTIC WORKERS. LASTLY CIPC AND PARTNERS ARE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION OUTREACH AND LEGAL SERVICES TO IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ONE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. TO COMBAT THE HARM DONE BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASSISTANT FOR BILLING THE PROMISE OF THE BIDEN HERE SAID MINISTRATIONS IMMIGRATION EFFORTS AND COUNTER THE EFFECTS OF KOPET. WE'RE ASKING THE STATE FOR A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME FUNDING BOOST TO THE ONE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM TO BE SPREAD OUT OVER TWO YEARS. THIS FUNDING WOULD GO TOWARDS INCREASING EDUCATION OUTREACH PROGRAMS BY STATEWIDE PARTNERS INCREASE LANGUAGE CAPACITY GRANTS- POSTDOC APPLICATION COMPS COMPLETIONS AND ALLOW THE STATE TO HAVE A FUNDING SOURCE TO MATCH ANY PROPOSED FEDERAL IMMIGRATION CHANGES THANK CALIFORNIANS CAN IMMEDIATELY BENEFIT. THE WORK TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF EQUITY FOR CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANTS IS GOING TO NEED INVESTMENTS IN FUNDING AND INVESTMENTS IN TIME. BUT CALIFORNIA'S PROMISE OF A BETTER FUTURE SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED BY IMMIGRATION STATUS ESPECIALLY WHEN OUR STATE IS FUELED BY THE WORK OF ITS IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. WE COULD NOT BE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL IF WE ONLY PROVIDE FOR SELF. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU AND AMEN. THE STUFF THAT WAS WELL SET- I'D LIKE TO TURN MY QUESTIONS THE DEPARTMENT IF I COULD BUT BEFORE I BEGAN I WANTED TO EXTEND AN APPRECIATION FOR NICOLE VASQUEZ FOR A GREAT RIGHT UP ON THE SECTION IT'S HARD TO CAPTURE WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE AND I THINK SHE'S DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB OF IT AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO HIGHLIGHT HER. I'M IN IT'S- BEING SPECIFIC I ALSO LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT AGE ADJUSTMENT AND THE IMPORTANCE FOR US TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION. AS WERE EVALUATING DISPARITIES WHAT WE WILL SEE THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC IS AFTER WE ADJUST FOR AGE. THAT THOSE DISPARITIES WILL WIDEN FOR OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CONVERSATION FOR US TO INCLUDE. BUT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO DIRECTOR JOHNSON IF I COULD WE HAD ASKED A QUESTION OF WESTERN CENTER OF MY CARROLLTON. BUT I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR- THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THINKING HERE TOO BUT WHAT STEPS CAN WE TAKE WITH CAL WORKS TO MAKE IT MORE HUMAN CENTERED AND LESS COMPLIANCE ORIENTED. THANK YOU CHAIR KEN JOHNSON A PERMANENT SOCIAL SERVICES IN AND APPRECIATE ALFA CONVERSATION ON THIS PANEL. I WOULD JUST I WOULD I WOULD BE LIFT UP A FEW THINGS AND- EACH KNOW THERE SIR. QUITE A PERSON IN TERMS OF THE COW PRO. AT THAT IS CURRENTLY AT ON THE BOOKS WE SAY STATUTE IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE MOVING FORWARD I THINK. OTHER WORK GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN REFERENCED BECAU OR STAKEHOLDER- AT. PROCESS THAT I MENTIONED ALSO WAS REALLY HELPFUL I THINK TO HAVE- THAT THE VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES IN THE SAME ROOM HAVING THE CONVERSATION SO JUST GIVE A CONCRETE EXAMPLE IT WAS I THINK IN A AND A LOGIC MODEL EXERCISE WHERE WE HAD ORIGINALLY. HABIT HAVEN'T OUTCOME RELATED TO ADHERENTS AT TO THE INDIVIDUALS- YOU KNOW AS- IT ARE HEARING TO RULES THE PRO AS ASSAM WE WANTED TO IS. VERSES AT THE ACTUAL. BEEN IF A BIG SEEING ADDITIONAL WAGES ADDITION RESOURCE SEEING ADS. TO AT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND OUTCOME O THE CHILDREN EVEN RIGHT IN SO AGAIN I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE WORK THAT THAT SPACE HAS LENT IN TERMS OF AGAIN HOW WE'RE MEASURING PROGRESS WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING- THE WORK- THAT HAS BEEN REFERENCED EARLIER RELATED TO THE COUNTY AT WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION'S WORK ON TWO POINT OH. WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT ENGAGEMENT SO AGAIN. AS THE AS IT CONCRETE EXAMPLE AFTER- IN INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPS THEIR WELFARE TO WORK PLAN DO THEY KNOW WHAT'S IN IT IS IT DRIVEN BY THE INDIVIDUAL I THINK ALL OF THESE- PROCESS SEASON EXPERIENCES THAT WE'VE HAD IN TO GET HERE- AS WAS. PREVIOUSLY STATED BY THE SCRAPPY THAT THE STATE MAP RIGHT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO SUPPORT. INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES EXPERIENCING POVERTY AGAIN THE TREMENDOUS ADDITIONAL STRESSORS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR WITH THE PANDEMIC WITH SCHOOLS BEING CLOSED EXCEPT. IT'S JUST CRITICAL THAT WE ARE. UTILIZING STRENGTH BASED APPROACHES SO I WOULD SAY PART OF OUR RESPONSE IN IN SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN DO THAT AND AGAIN A PLACE WHERE IT'S NEWARK. THAT WE ARE CAPTURING LESSONS LEARNED IS THAT ARE CAL WORKS HOME VISITING PROGRAM VOLUNTARY- FOR THE INDIVIDUAL- TO PARTICIPATE AND BUT REALLY SAYING. HAVING A TRUSTED PARTNER TO IDENTIFY- WHAT A FAMILY NEEDS IN A GIVEN MOMENT HELPING CONNECTS THEM TO THOSE RESOURCES AND HAVING A WAY. TO CONTINUE THAT RELATIONSHIP OVER TIME AND ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS WITH THE ARRAY THAT WE HAVE BUILT I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE. A WHILE IT ALSO HAS HAD ADJUSTMENTS TO GOING REMOTE I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL IN S. AT THINKING THROUGH AGAIN. HOW WE'RE ADJUSTING TO WHAT FAMILIES NEEDS I THINK SOME OF THE COMP. AND RECKON. THAT HAVE SHARE TODAY. AROUND ARE ALL AREAS AGAIN THAT WE ARE GLAD TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS- IT IS IT IS WHAT WHEN I SPEAK TO THE TOOLS BY WHICH THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO- USE RIGHT EACH EACH OF OUR DIVISIONS IS IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN EQUITY PLAN AND SO. AGAIN WE HAVE A COMMITMENT- ALONG. IMMEDIATELY AND MOVING FORWARD SET TO REALLY WORK ON IDENTIFYING WHERE WE DO NOT SEE THE NEED FOR POLICY CHANGES MAKING THOSE. ADJUSTMENTS AND PROPOSALS THROUGH THE PROCESS SO I WOULD JUST AGAIN STATES EVOLVING- WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY SECURE PROPERTY SUSPEND SOME WAYS AT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THE PROGRAM ADULT MOST SUCCESSFUL. AT FOR THEIR BENEFIT. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND- BEING AND WITH THE WORKS HOME VISIT PROGRAM I'M A BIG FAN AND PROPONENT AS WELL AND BELIEVE IT'S AN EXCELLENT WAY FOR US TO ESTABLISH A- THOSE TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE SO NECESSARY. I WANTED TO DIG IN TO ONE OF MY CAROL'S. RECOMMENDATIONS THOUGH REGARDING DATA FOR CAL WORKS FOR US TO EVALUATE AND FIGURE OUT IF THERE WERE PROGRAMMATIC DECISIONS WHICH WERE. HURTING OR LIMITING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND TO GET A RESPONSE FROM YOU IF I COULD DIRECTOR JOHNSON. SURE AGAIN I THINK THAT'S WE WOULD BE GLAD TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT ON THAT. REQUEST TO SEE WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF PLACES AGAIN WITH THE WORK OF THE LEGISLATURE- INDEED MINISTRATION OVER TIME WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF REPORTS. RELATED TO VARIOUS POLICIES WHETHER THEY BE- AT TIME CLOCK SIX ADDRESS THOUGH GLAD TO TAKE A LOOK AT BOTH WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND WHAT MIGHT BE. NEEDED IN ADDITION TO SEE WHAT WE COULD POSSIBLY DO TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT REQUEST THANK YOU- MY NEXT QUESTION IS FOR- MARKHAM ME JACK WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I. WANTED TO SEE IF THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE AMENABLE TO CODIFYING THE GOALS. OF THE AGENCY AND ITS DEPARTMENTS IN AN EFFORTS TO FORMALIZE AND TO INSTITUTIONALIZE. THIS DEVELOPING MISSION OF EQUITY. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW IS A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT REALLY LOOKS AT. WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BUILD THE FOUNDATION I THINK WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ALL TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST PROCEED WITH REGARDS TO ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PIECES. AS PART OF THAT I THINK IS REALLY BUILDING OUT A FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT OUR WORK REALLY LOOKS LIKE AND I THINK PART OF IT IS JUST MAKING SURE. THAT OUT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY JUST CODIFY THE IDEA OF DOING A FRAMEWORK THAT WERE BERMAN MORE AND MORE FOCUSED ON QATAR. ACTUAL ACTIONS OR CHANGES BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO DRIVE REALLY OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER ON TRUE OUTCOMES. AND PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES INDIVIDUAL SMALL ALL THAT TO SAY I THINK WERE WORSE IN OPEN TO CONTINUE KERR. WITH YOUR STAFF AND LEGISLATURE WITH REGARDS WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE OPERATE THAT YOU KNOW WE WORK WE WOULD PREFER NOT TO QATAR. JUST SIMPLY HASN'T A FREE. WELL WE- TO CODIFY TO SAY HERE IS WHAT. THAT WE HELP OUT AND REALLY LOOKING WAYS AND WE CAN THAT COLLECT ACCOUNT OF. FOR TIME MATTER OUTCOMES THROUGH. TO FRAME. I AM HAPPY TO HAVE OF UP CALL. A KNOW THAT THERE ARE FINISHED BE LED MIKE. TO THE SPACE AS WELL AND- I LIKE TO JUST FOR US TO TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN. PARTNER DOES THAT TWO TWENTY BUDGET AND COME TRADE BILL FORM. THIS CRITICAL KERR MOVING FORWARD. BUT WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK MUCH PANEL TO AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL THREE ON HOMELESSNESS AND FAMILY SERVED IN THE ANTI POVERTY PROGRAMS. WE HAVE SEVEN PANELISTS ISSUE THREE WE WILL BEGIN WITH SARA KIMBERLIN SENIOR POLICY ANALYST WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. AGAIN WE WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE CENTERS HAVE CONCLUDED. THIS KIMBERLIN CAN YOU PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON KAREN MILLEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS ERICA MARYLAND AND I'M A SENIOR POLICY ANALYST WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE URGENT HOUSING NEEDS FACING CALIFORNIANS DURING BECAUSE OF IT AND AFTER WE EMERGE FROM THE PANDEMIC. PARTICULARLY FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH LOW INCOMES. SB THREE THINGS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOUSING NEEDS RIGHT NOW. WHAT HOUSING NEEDS LOOK LIKE BEFORE CO THEN WHY THAT MATTERS AND WHY WE MIGHT INTO WHAT WE MIGHT ANTICIPATE AFTER THE PANDEMIC IS UNDER CONTROL. FIRST OF SPEAK TO HOUSING NEEDS DURING COVE IT. THE LATEST AVAILABLE DATA FROM THE CENSUS BUREAU THESE ARE CURRENT AS OF MARCH FIRST CLEARLY SHOW THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH HOUSING COSTS RIGHT NOW. THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH LOW INCOMES AMONG RENTERS WITH INCOMES UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE IN FIVE RECORDED BEING BEHIND ON RENT PAYMENTS AMONG RENTERS AND HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN ONE IN FOUR RECORDED BEING BEHIND ON RENT. AND STRUGGLES KEEPING UP WITH RENT WERE MOST COMMON AMONG CALIFORNIA. RENTERS WHO ARE BLACK OR LATIN ACTS. NONE OF THIS IS A- BECAUSE LOSSES DURING THE PANDEMIC HAVE HIT LOW WAGE WORKERS THE HARDEST. AND HIT HIT BLACK AND NOT NEXT WORKERS ESPECIALLY HARD AS THE BUDGET CENTER HAS DOCUMENTED. A NUMBER OF ACTIONS BY POLICY MAKERS AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT IN HELPING CALIFORNIANS MAINTAIN STABLE HOUSING DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE STATE'S ADDICTION MORATORIUM HAS BEEN CRITICAL BUT IT CURRENTLY EXPIRES AT THE END OF JUNE WHEN IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE JOB MARKET WILL HAVE FULLY RECOVERED. ALSO SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW TO HELP INDIVIDUALS WHO- BACKGROUND OR WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH RENTS. AND THERE BEEN A RANGE OF ESTIMATES FROM CREDIBLE SOURCES OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF RENT THAT RIGHT NOW BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE KNOW THAT A SUBSTANTIAL SHARE CALIFORNIA RENTERS ARE STRUGGLING NOW. AND WE CAN BE SURE THAT MANY WILL STILL BE STRUGGLING AT THE END OF JUNE WHEN THE STATE EVICTION MORATORIUM ENDS- AND IN THE FALL WHEN ENHANCE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ARE SUCH AND- ONE. LAST COMMENT ABOUT NEED DURING. WHEN THINKING ABOUT URGENT NEEDS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE BUDGET CENTER HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF PAYING ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND THERE'S A MIX THAT I FAMILIES. THESE INDIVIDUALS CONTRIBUTE JUST AS MUCH TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES AND ECONOMY. IN FACT MANY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS DURING KOPET. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM MUCH OF THE FEDERAL COVET ASSISTANCE AND ARE BLOCKED FROM MANY OF THE ON GOING SO THE SOURCES OF SUPPORT WHEN IN CRISIS. SO THEY FACE THE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER GAP WHEN STRUGGLING TO MAKE MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. SO THAT'S THE HOUSING SITUATION RIGHT NOW BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALSO LOOK BACKWARD TO THE TIME BEFORE KOBE WHICH IS THE SECOND POINT I WILL BRIEFLY ADDRESS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT CALIFORNIA FACED A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS BEFORE COVE IT BACK WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS FULLY OPEN AND BOOMING MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S RENTERS AND ABOUT EIGHT IN TEN HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOMES UNDER 2100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. WE'RE ALREADY PAYING AND AFFORDABLE AMOUNT TOWARD HOUSING. AND THE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS FOR THOSE WHO ARE BLACK LAB MIX THE CIVIC ISLANDER AND AMERICAN INDIAN. AS WELL AS CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED. IN TERMS OF HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO KNOW THE BLACK CALIFORNIANS IN PARTICULAR WERE CARRYING A STARTLINGLY INEQUITABLE BURDEN OF HOMELESSNESS BEFORE COBIT. THESE RACIAL INEQUITIES REFLECT THE FACT THE BLACK LAB MIX AND MANY OTHER CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR I'M MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LOW INCOMES AS A RESULT OF STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. AND I'VE ALSO BEEN BLOCKED FROM HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES IN PART DUE TO A LEGACY OF EXPLICITLY RACIST HOUSING POLICIES. SO THERE TO TAKE TAKE AWAY FROM WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOUSING NEEDS BEFORE BECAUSE OF IT. FIRST OF THE MANY CALIFORNIANS FACE URGENT HOUSING NEEDS EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS. AND SECONDLY EVEN BEFORE KOBE THERE WERE RACIAL INEQUITIES IN WHO FACE THE GREATEST HOUSING CHALLENGES. FINALLY SPEAK ABOUT THE HOUSING NEEDS WE MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE AFTER WE EMERGE FROM THE PENTOMIC. AT THE BUDGET CENTER WE WORRY ABOUT THE FACT THAT COULD BE JOB LOSSES HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATED AMONG LOW WAGE WORKERS. SO THE JOB RECOVERY MAY TAKE THE LONGEST TIME FOR THESE WORKERS AND SOME OF THE JOBS THESE TO HAVE MAYBE PERMANENTLY GONE. OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THERE IS SHORT TERM SUPPORT TO HELP PEOPLE COPE WITH UNEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY RAT. BUT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE STILL OUT OF WORK. AND STILL STRUGGLING TO COVER HOUSING COSTS WHEN THIS EMERGENCY SUPPORT ENDS. THESE ARE LIKELY TO BE THE CALIFORNIANS WHO RESTRICT RECALLING THE MOST OF HOUSING NEEDS BEFORE BECAUSE OF IT INCLUDING RENTERS. THOSE WITH THE LOWEST INCOMES AND MANY CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR. AS WELL AS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HIT HARDEST BY JOB LOSSES DURING THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING BLACK AND LET NEXT WORKERS. AND THOSE HAVE BEEN BLOCKED FROM SUPPORT DURING HOPE IT INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED AND MIXED STATUS FAMILIES. SO I'LL CONCLUDE WHY THIS MATTERS. THAT HOUSING IS REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH. AND A GATEWAY TO EDUCATIONAL AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. SO THAT EXPERIENCING HOUSING INSTABILITY OR WORSE FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS AND SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE HOUSING NEEDS ARE MET RIGHT NOW DURING THE PATHETIC BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO THINK BEYOND THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS CRISES WERE HERE BEFORE COPAYS. AND WILL NOT DISAPPEAR FOR THE PANDEMIC BEDS. FOR THAT REASON IT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK LONG TERM AS WELL AND TO PRIORITIZE ONGOING SUPPORT FROM THE STATE TO ADDRESS HOUSING NEEDS AND HOMELESSNESS ESPECIALLY FOR THE CALIFORNIANS MOST AFFECTED BY THESE CRISES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KIM JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN JOHNSON THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND WANT TO APPRECIATE AND ECHO ABS. COMMENTS IN THE IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF HOUSING AT TO THE RACIAL EQUITY CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD AND SOME ABSOLUTE- SYSTEMIC ROOTS AND STRUCTURAL RACISM AND HOW HOUSING HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE. TO TWO DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OVER TIME SO- APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AGAIN IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- ACT HUGE PRIORITY OF OUR GOVERNORS IN A PLACE THAT WE'VE BEEN. INVESTING OUTSIDE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR PROPOSAL IN JUST A MOMENT BACK IN TERMS OF THE COW WORKS PROGRAM AGAIN- THE LEGISLATURE. ADMINISTRATION HAVE. INVESTED IN A COUPLE OF- AT AND HOMELESSNESS. PROGRAMS AND SO IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION AROUND NEED I WILL SAY THAT IN BOTH CASES NOT PROVIDE THE DATA HERE THEY ARE. WE ARE SEEING MORE ASK MORE REQUESTS THAN WE HAVE RESOURCES TO FIND SO THE COW WORKS THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED TO ASSIST FAMILIES IN THE CALYX PROGRAM. MEET MEET THE COST OF SECURING OR MAINTAINING A PERMANENT HOUSING OR PROVIDE. A TEMPORARY EMERGENCY SHELTER- AB HOUSING IS THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM INCLUDES BOTH TEMPORARY HOMELESS ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS- A PERMANENT AT THAT CAN ALSO SUPPORT SECURITY DEPOSITS. AND TWO MONTHS OF RENTAL ARREARS TO PREVENT EVICTION AND HOMELESSNESS. I IN THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY COUNTIES RECEIVED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHT REQUESTS FOR HOMELESS ASSISTANCE WHICH IS AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM. AND APPROVED STATEWIDE SO AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NEEDS. IN A THE COW HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM IS THIS TO FIVE. HOUSING STABILITY FOR FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM ASSISTS FAMILIES IN SECURING AND MAINTAINING PERMANENT HOUSING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS. ASPECT CONSISTENT WITH OUR HOUSING FIRST MODELS. AT BEGIN LOOKING AT THE NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR FIFTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN FAMILIES REQUESTED ASSISTANCE FOR THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM AND NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN WERE APPROVED I WE HAVE A FIVE THOUSAND OR SIX THOUSAND FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO TRANSITIONING INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IN THIS CURRENT YEAR AND WITH THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN A NOTABLE DECREASE IN BOTH APPLICATIONS AND APPROVALS. FOR THESE PROGRAMS BASED ON OUR COUNTY STIRRED A DAY THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COSTS FOR THIS DECREASE IS IN FACT. AT THE EVICTION MORATORIUM WHICH IS ALLOWED FAMILIES TO MAINTAIN HOUSING DURING THE PANDEMIC SO SUCCESS IN THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS AT THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE IN THIS PARTICULAR TIME. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS ESTABLISHED AND PUBLISHED GUIDES TO SUPPORT BOTH COUNTIES AND TRIBES TO ADDRESS HOUSING INSTABILITY THROUGH THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS. INCLUDING ONE TIME PAYMENTS AGAIN TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC APPREHENSION OF ADDICTION AND HOMELESSNESS. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT GIVEN THE DATA WE ARE SEEING BROADLY ACROSS THE STATE RELATIVE TO HOUSING INSECURITY AND LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN FAMILY'S ABILITY TO PAY RENT THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK THIS NEED VERY CLOSELY WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AS SUCH AS THOSE IN THE BUSINESS CONSUMER. SERVICES IN HOUSING AGENCY TO ENSURE FAMILIES SERVED BY UNSOCIAL SERVICES ARE CONNECTED TO ALL OF THAT COULD BE NINETEEN RENTAL LEASE PROGRAMS WHICH PROVIDE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND HAS RECENTLY ROLLED ROLLED OUT. I JUST THIS WEEK SO AGAIN WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE THOSE BRIDGES AND CONNECTIONS FOR ADVERTISEMENTS AND CAL WORKS. AT THIS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER A QUESTION RELATED TO THE TABLET PANDEMIC EMERGENCY FUNDS THAT WAS AUTHORIZED ON MARCH ELEVENTH WHEN THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. ARE BASED ON OUR INITIAL READING THE INFORMATION WE ARE EXPECTING TO RECEIVE ACT APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN RELIEF AND THAT CAN BE USED. TO SUPPORT HOUSEHOLDS WOULD NOT BE CURRENT SHORT TERM BENEFITS THAT DEAL WITH A SPECIFIC CRISIS I DON'T MEET A RECURRING OR ONGOING NEED AND DON'T EXPECT EXTEND BEYOND FOUR MONTHS SO AGAIN WILL BE LOOKING TO. HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION ON THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. AND FINALLY AS I MENTIONED WITH THE CONTINUED COMMITMENTS AND NUMBER ABS- EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT WE THEIR GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME. INVESTMENT OVER THREE YEARS FOR THE CREATION OF THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM WHICH WOULD SUPPORT TO BE ACQUISITION OR REHABILITATION OF OUR ADULT IN SENIOR CARE I PROGRAMS ARE ASSISTED LIVING AS THEY'RE COMMONLY KNOWN. THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE AG DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD EXPAND TREATMENT AND RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS FOR THOSE WITH APRIL HEALTH CONDITIONS. SO IT'S PART OF A LARGER PACKAGE AGAIN AND THINKING ABOUT. THE LONG TERM CARE CONTINUE YOU THE MANY WAYS THAT WE ARE STUCK PRETTY IN THIS CASE- ARE ARE A- IN AN- WITH THE ABILITY AGAIN PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR ACQUISITION AND RENOVATION. AND AGAIN THESE ARE SETTINGS THAT ARE SUPPORTING- INDIVIDUALS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE REQUIRE INSTITUTIONAL CARE- IN ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS. WE HAVE- CERTAINLY HAVE A VERY ARE BURIED- A SUPPLY OF THIS FACILITY TYPE ACROSS THE STATE BUT REALLY WOULD YOU HAVE A SHORTAGE IN THOSE AT PROGRAMS THAT ACCEPT. THE SS I SS P. A PAYMENT IN THE AND FOR RECIPIENTS THAT HAVE THAT FUN SOURCE SO WE HAVE SEEN A DECLINE IN THAT IN THOSE NUMBERS. MORE SPECIFICALLY FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN TO THE THIRD QUARTER F TWENTY TWENTY THERE'S BEEN A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 6% AND THE NUMBER OF EXERCISES AT RECIPIENTS RESIDING IN ADULT KERR SENIOR FACILITIES. SO THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO ACCEPT. THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE- AND CHIU SAID IN A AS A COME. OF SOME WE- HAVE BEEN ASKED A LOT. AROUND ALSO THE OPERATIONAL SUPPORTS AGAIN I THINK WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR. COMPONENT OF THAT PROPOSAL IN INCOME A COLLABORATION INTEGRATED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES COMPOUND WHICH DOES OFFER SOME ADDITIONAL. AT SERVICE DOLLARS IN RESOURCES- SO I GLAD TO ANSWER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY PROPOSING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ADD TO PROVIDE- THAT THE MECHANISMS TO GET THESE RESOURCES OUT INTO COMMUNITIES BUT CERTAINLY AS WE ALWAYS DO WILL ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THE DEVELOPMENT. OF APPLICATIONS AND MORE SPECIFICS AROUND ALLOCATIONS EXCITER THANK YOU. THANK YOU DIRECTOR NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CORN BUCHANAN THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THANK YOU SO MUCH HI I'M YOU CANNOT ANSWER IS YES. ACTOR HOUSE IN HOMELESS S. S. B. S. SOME DETAILS THE ARE OPERATE IN THE WEEK EVEN THEY SUPPORT IN THE AND FAMILIES DURING THE ACT AND HOW WE CAN MEET THE ON NEED TO ADDRESS HOUSING. IN HOMELESS AS WE WERE FROM AND I'M BACK. WHY DON'T AND ARE. A RATE THE RECORD SHARED OUR WORK WITH THE BILL CONCERN SERVICE. HOUSING THE END OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT OF. WORKER A AND- BUT NIGHT RIGHT RELIEF PROGRAM. WHICH WILL PROVIDE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN FUNDING FOR RENT WERE. ON THEIR RENT. THE TOTAL FUNDING TO K. WHICH INCLUDES ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE ALSO GOING DIRECTLY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IS TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. IT RECENTLY SIGNED AMERICAN RESCUE PACKAGE WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING. WITH AN ESTIMATED TWO POINT TWO BILLION IN NEW FUNDING TO CALIFORNIA TO HELP PAY RENTAL AND UTILITY ARREARS AS- RECENTLY CRITICAL- NEW RESOURCE. AND SO WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO ENSURE THAT DFS RECIPIENTS ARE ACCESSING THE VERY IMPORTANT HOUSING RESOURCE. LOCAL AND HOW. THE ONLY ONE TO TALK WITH OUR PROGRAM THE FOR HOW YEAH HOW ARE IS THAT PROGRAM- SERVICE AND THE CALLER PROGRAMS THAT ARE HOMELESS OR EXPERIENCE OUT HOW CRISIS. RIGHT THE HOUSING SAID PROGRAM IS SLIGHTLY MORE TARGETED. CALIFORNIA IS A HOW FIRST STATE MEANS THAT FARM USED TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS PRIORITY YEAH WITH. YOU MAY NEED FOR SERVICES HAS EXCEEDED COUNTIES ABILITY TO FOR IN PART DUE TO THE PROGRAM RAMP UP. KOREAN NIGHT I MAY ASK YOU TO TURN THE VEIL OFF FOR HAVING QUITE A BIT OF- TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES IF THAT'S OKAY. YEAH. JORDAN PLEASE CONTINUE START. THE COURT. BUT. I'M JUST DESCRIBING IS A MORE TARGETED- IN THAT IT SERVES PEOPLE WHO ARE LITERALLY HOMELESS OR OR IN RECEIPT OF A JUDGMENT FOR ACTON. AND THEN I WAS DESCRIBING SORT OF THAT THE TRENDS OVER TIME WITH OUR PROGRAM- IN TERMS OF THE SERVICES AT BASICALLY THE DEMAND EXCEEDING OUR OUR COUNTIES ABILITY TO SERVE WHICH WAS IN PART DUE TO PROGRAM RAMP UP OVER TIME AS WELL AS FUNDING DEMANDS FOR THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES AND BEAT S. PROGRAM I'M SO IN EVERY YEAR OF OPERATION THE FUNDING AMOUNT THAT WAS REQUESTED BY COUNTIES HAS EXCEEDED AMOUNT THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO A WAR. BUT YOU'RE OVER YOUR COUNTIES TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND BETTER MEET THE GOALS OF HOUSING MORE FAMILIES FOR A TOTAL OF OVER FIFTY ONE THOUSAND FAMILIES SERVICE SINCE THE PROGRAM LAUNCHED IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE NOT AND HOMELESSNESS FOR ALL FAMILIES AND CAL. YES DESPITE THE- MADE THE FAR IN THE NINETY MILLION AN ONGOING FUNDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FAMILIES AND HOW IT WORKS MORE COMPLEX ARE STILL UNABLE BURKE. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR YES I JUST RECEIVED REQUESTS FROM FIFTY FOUR COUNTIES REQUESTING OVER ONE POINT SIX MILLION. ESTIMATING. TO FOR FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN FAMILIES. THE PANDEMIC HAS INCREASED THE COMPLEXITY OF MEETING THE NEEDS OF CALVERT FAMILIES OFTEN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE'RE SEEING THAT FAMILIES NEED ASSISTANCE FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AND WITH MORE INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR SPECIALIZED HOUSING NAVIGATORS. IN OUR INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND RENTAL MARKET. WHEN I MOVE ON TO THE GREEN FAMILY'S HOME PROGRAM WHICH IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES AND THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM EXPERIENCING OR AT RISK OF. NOT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES REUNIFYING AND TO PREVENT FOSTER CARE. IN TWENTY NINETEEN YES THAT'S RECEIVED APPLICATIONS AND FUNDING REQUESTS FROM TWENTY SIX APPLICANTS THAT WERE REQUESTING ALMOST THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. ALL OF TOTAL WILL BE TWENTY FIVE BILLION STATE FUNDS WAS AWARDED TO TWENTY TWO COMMUNITIES FR THE THREE YEAR PILOT GRANT I CALL. HE'S COUNTIES AND TRIBES WHO WERE FUNDED ACCOUNT 475% OF THE TOTAL STATEWIDE CHILD WELFARE CASELOADS. IN TOTAL ESTIMATING OVER SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FAMILIES WHO ARE LIKELY ELIGIBLE FAMILIES. WITH THE CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO SIR TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO FAMILIES OVER A THREE YEAR. NEXT I'LL TAKE US MOVES RIGHT ALONG TO THE HOUSING DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAMMER EACH CHAPTER. WHICH ASSISTS HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABLING CONDITIONS TO APPLY FOR DISABILITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS NAMELY SSI WHILE ALSO PROVIDING HOUSING SUPPORT. FORTY FOUR GRANTEES INCLUDING TO TRIBAL ENTITIES PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND PROVIDE OUTREACH CASE MANAGEMENT DISABILITY BENEFITS ADVOCACY AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE. H. DOBSON SECTION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY HOUSE OVER FORTY THOUSAND DISABILITY PPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND OVER ONE THOUSAND APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN APPROVED. YES THIS IS ABOUT IMPORTANT NUMBER HERE THIS REFLECTS A 78% DISABILITY BENEFIT APPLICATION APPROVAL RATE FOR DISPOSED APPLICATIONS WHILE THE STATE AVERAGE IS 39% WITH ME GREAT SUCCESS IN TERMS OF THAT. THE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE SUBMITTED. GRANTEES IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR HIGHER KEYS WE'RE OF MY STAFFING LEVELS THAN THEY HAD ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. THIS MEANS GRANT YOU HAVE ADDED STAFF TO ACCOMMODATE. CLIENT RATIOS WHILE ALSO TRYING TO LEVERAGE RELATIONSHIPS AND BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR. I'M AND OTHER NECESSARY FOR. ADDITIONALLY I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT THE ROCK THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN TWO YEARS I HAVE SPECIFICALLY PARTNERED ON PROJECT ROOM HE EFFORT. THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT. RANKINGS WERE ABLE TO MORE EASILY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT AND INCREASED NUMBER OF POTENTIAL AND CURRENT EACH OUR CLIENTS. WERE TEMPLE THAT TEMPORARILY HOUSED THROUGH PROJECT ROOM HE ARE CODED RESPONSE FOR PEOPLE COMPLEX HEALTH CONDITIONS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE VERY CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH OUR WITH OUR EACH CHAPTER. RIGHT ALREADY POPULAR EACH. SO LASTLY I'M I'LL SHARE ABOUT IT A FEW KEY LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE WHOLE STATE PROGRAM. WHICH PROVIDES HOUSING INTERVENTIONS FOR THOSE SERVED BY ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. TRANSACTION IN THE LOCK AND THE LIGHTS AT TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE HOME STATE. OVER TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED OLDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS WORK THE THING RIGHT THANK. THE PILOTS OKAY IS PRIMARILY ON HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION BUT SOME COUNTIES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY EXPANDED THEIR MODEL DISTRICT PPS CLIENTS WE'RE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WELL. OFTEN HOMES THEY SERVES AS- A TYPE OF BRIDGE FOR A PERSON THAT NEEDS LONGER TERM SUPPORT BY PROVIDING THAT SAFE TEMPORARY HOUSING OPTION. I CANNOT STAND OTHER STABILIZING THESE PARTS OF. TWENTY PROGRAM. FLAG THERE TO CIRCUMVENT. WOULD BE A GROUP OF MORE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE A LONG TERM CASE MANAGEMENT AFTER CLIENT ACCEPTS SOME STATE AND- NOT SURPRISINGLY MORE AFFORDABLE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OPTIONS INCLUDING LICENSE ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES. FOR CLIENTS THAT CAN NO LONGER LIVE. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE ABOUT OUR WORK TO MEET THE HOUSING NEEDS OF THE EFFORTS THAT. TO ENSURE OUR ABILITY. YEAH THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM ANGELES SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU- ANGELA SHORT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE OF WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO FIRST PROVIDE- ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THE DSS PROPOSED INVESTMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY OR RCMP'S AND ADULT RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES OR ARTISTS- THIS IS THE PROPOSAL THAT A TRACTOR JOHNSON ALSO SPOKE TO YOU. EARLIER ON THIS PANEL OTHER PROPOSALS ALSO DESCRIBED ON PAGE FIFTY EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA SO AGAIN THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FUNDING TO BE ADMINISTERED BY DSS TO SUPPORT THE ACQUISITION AND REHABILITATION. OF THE LICENSED ARSON RCMP IS- GRANTS WOULD BE PROVIDED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THIS PURPOSE AGAIN THIS PROGRAM I WOULD BE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S BROADER HOMELESSNESS STRATEGY. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO DATA LIMITATIONS THAT COMPLICATES. OUR FULL ASSESSMENT OF THIS PROPOSAL. NAMELY DSS TRACKS THE TOTAL NUMBER CAPACITY AND LOCATIONS OF ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES THAT CLOSE AS WELL AS THOSE THAT ARE NEWLY LICENSED. HOWEVER TO THE BEST PARTNER STANDING- THERE'S NOT AGGREGATED DATA AVAILABLE ABOUT ONE Y. FACILITIES CLOSE FOR EXAMPLE DUE TO FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. TO IF THERE ARE CERTAIN TRAITS THAT ARE COMMON TO FACILITY IS THAT CLOSE SUCH AS AVERAGE MONTHLY RATES- AND THREE WHAT HAPPENS TO RESIDENTS WHEN FACILITIES CLOSE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER THEY BECOME HOMELESS OR IF THEY'RE ABLE TO. MOVE INTO A DIFFERENT FACILITY AND WITHOUT THESE DATA POINTS ASSESSING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT THESE FACILITIES IT'S DIFFICULT- IN PARTICULAR GIVEN THE STATE LIMITATIONS. WE REALLY CAN'T SAY FOR CERTAIN WHAT IS DRIVING ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITY FACILITIES TO CLOSE AND ACCORDINGLY WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE PROPOSED ONE TIME FUNDS WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO ADDRESS THEM. M. IF WE KNEW WHETHER FACILITIES WERE CLOSING DUE TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES THAT WOULD HELP US UNDERSTAND IF THE ADMINISTRATION'S ONE TIME FUNDING APPROACH- COULD HELP EFFECTIVELY MEDICAID CLOSURES. WHEREAS ALTERNATIVELY IF DATA SHOWED US THE CLOSURES ARE ACTUALLY DRIVEN BY- INSUFFICIENT BOARDING CARE RATES. THEN WE COULD ASSESS WHETHER A MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO PREVENT CLOSURES. MIGHT ACTUALLY BE TO INCREASE THESE RATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS I'M SO AGAIN WITH THE WITH THE DATA LIMITATIONS IS JUST DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE- INTERVENTION COULD BE. I'M ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATION WE WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT- IS RELATED TO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROPOSAL- AS YOU HEARD FROM DIRECTOR JOHNSON THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO INTRODUCE A TO ESTABLISH THIS PROGRAM THROUGH BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE- HOWEVER WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW TO ENSURE. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD REALLY HAVE SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM WITHOUT SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION- IN OTHER WORDS TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION AND WE AGREE WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON PAGE SIXTY ONE OF YOUR AGENDA- THEREFORE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE DRAFT. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH- OF THIS PROGRAM AND THAT ITS IMPLEMENTATION- AND IN OUR SYSTEM AND THAT LANGUAGE SHOULD LAY OUT THE PARAMETERS OF THE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE HOW WILL FUNDS BE TARGETED HOW WE ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE USED FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. AND WHAT REPORTING WILL BE REQUIRED FROM- RECIPIENTS IN TERMS OF EXPECTED RESULTS AND OTHER OUTCOMES TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO TRACK. THE PROGRESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS INVESTMENT. MOVING ON WE'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED WHAT AND KHIMETRICS- UP WOULD BE TO CONSIDER TO INCLUDE IN A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PROGRAM- I WILL NOTE THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH DSS CURRENTLY TO DETERMINE WHAT WHAT ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD- AS WELL AS STATUTORY OR REGULAR AT REGULATORY GUIDANCE MIGHT BE NEEDED IN ORDER TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL DATA TO ALLOW US TO MORE FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS DRIVING DON'T SENIOR CARE FACILITY CLOSURES- AND ASSESS BARRIERS- IN PARTICULAR FOR CERTAIN LOW INCOME POPULATIONS LIKE SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS. BUT THAT'S SAID- AND DEPENDING ON WHAT DATA COLLECTION ULTIMATELY IS POSSIBLE WE THINK SOME KEY METRICS TO HELP GAUGE THE EFFECTIVENESS COULD INCLUDE A ONE HOW MANY ARSON ARE SEE IF HE'S WOULD HAVE CLOSED BUT ARE STATE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS RESIDE AT THOSE FACILITIES. AND FINALLY FOR FACILITIES THAT RECEIVE FUNDING- ARE THOSE FACILITIES CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL IDSHIPS OR CONTINUING TO CONSIDER CLOSING SIX MONTHS TO ONE YEAR AFTER RECEIVING A GRANT IN OTHER WORDS WAS THAT ONE TIME FUNDING EFFECTIVE. ALSO JUST CONCLUDE AS MENTIONED WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH DSS TO ASSESS WHAT DATA POINTS COULD BE AVAILABLE. AND SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH PURSUING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROGRAM WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE OUR ASSESSMENT OF THAT DRAFT LANGUAGE ONCE IT'S AVAILABLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. RIGHT THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KATHY SUMMERLIN WITH ALL OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THE HOUSING CRISIS AFFECTS EVERY PROGRAM I MEMBERS RUN AND IT AFFECTS EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE. WE CAN'T REUNIFY CHILDREN OF PARENTS WHO LACKS ALTER OUR CAL WORK PARTICIPANTS CAN'T HOLD DOWN A JOB IF THEY'RE SLEEPING IN A CAR. ALL THEIR INDEPENDENT ADULTS WHO NEED OUR HELP FOR ABUSE AND NEGLECT ISSUES INCLUDING THE GROWING PROBLEM OF FINANCIAL ABUSE ARE MORE LIKELY TO FALL INTO L. HEALTH AND EVEN DIE PREMATURELY IF THEY LOSE THEIR HOUSE. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS COUNTIES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION. HAS SET UP A NUMBER OF HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TIED DIRECTLY TO THE HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS WE OPERATE. COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS AND STAFF KNOW OUR CLIENTS FASTER UNDERSTAND WHEN THE SERVICES ARE NEEDED. WE HAVE SOME PROPOSAL TO BOOST AND STRENGTHEN THESE PROGRAMS TO RESPOND TO HOUSING INSTABILITY AS WELL AS HOMELESSNESS WHICH ALL ADDRESS AS I RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS. IN THE ENGINE. FIRST WITH REGARD TO THE EXPERIENCE COUNTIES THAT HAD IN ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM AND MEETING NEEDS DURING HELLBENT. NOTHING IN SECURITY ANALYSTS WERE ALREADY AT CRISIS LEVELS FOR OUR CLIENTS AND NOT SURPRISINGLY WE SEEM AN EVEN GREATER NEED FOR HOUSING SUPPORT AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. AND THE HEALTH RISKS OF HOMELESSNESS ALREADY GREAT BECAME EVEN MORE LIFE OR DEATH WITH POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO COVER NINETEEN. ALSO WITH THE PANDEMIC CAN BOTH UNCERTAINTY AND CONSTANT CHANGE. COUNTING THE NUMEROUS TIMES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VARIOUS ONE TIME FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. THESE ARE VERY VERY WELCOME THEY ALSO CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO PLAN OUR BEST FIGURE OUT HOW TO BLEND TOGETHER SERVICES. ACROSS THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS WE OPERATE. WHILE WE APPLAUD THE EVICTION MORATORIUM BE UNINTENDED THE FACT IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN MORE DIFFICULT TO HELP OUR CLIENTS FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS. THIS REALLY SPEAKS TO THE UNDERLYING LACK OF HOUSING STOCK ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE RENTAL STOCK THAT WE HAVE ACROSS OUR STATE. I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DESPERATE IMPACTS OF ONGOING HOUSING DIFFICULTIES DURING THE PANDEMIC. I'M EXAMPLES INCLUDE THOSE LIVING AND NONTRADITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT A FORMAL LEASE LIKE IN A FAMILY MEMBERS CONVERTED GARAGE OR SHARING A HOME. THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROTECTIONS THAT SOMEONE WITH A FORMALLY SOMEWHERE WHERE DO. THOSE CAN STILL BE AFFECTED FOR NON PANDEMIC RELATED CAUSES ARE ALSO OFTEN THOSE THAT WE SERVE. ONE EXAMPLE A WOMAN HAS ESCAPED A VIOLENT BOYFRIEND OR HUSBAND I MAKE A CHANGE TO COME AROUND HER APARTMENT AND THREATENED HER HOUSING HER TO CALL THE POLICE. SHE MAY NOT HAVE ANY RENTAL PAYMENT PROBLEMS DUE TO CO BID AND AS A RESULT THE LAN OR CONFLICT OR EVEN NOW FOR BEING A DISTURBANCE OR NUISANCE TO THE NEIGHBORS. THIS TYPE OF THE VICTIM IS ALREADY A PROBLEM WITH OUTLOOK ADDED LAYER OF A PANDEMIC ON TOP CREATING THE POTENTIAL FOR ANY LOSS OF HOUSING BECAUSE OF FURTHER DOWNWARD. SPIRAL FOR SOMEONE WHO EXPERIENCES THAT. IT'S REALLY IN. TO UNDERSTAND THE CRISIS THAT ADDICTION CREATES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND FAMILIES OF COLOR. ACCORDING TO THE EVICTION LAB AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. LOW INCOME WOMEN ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN OF COLOR. ABOUT HIGH RISK OF THE- READERS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AND FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ARE AT PARTICULARLY HIGH RISK. THE VESSEL HAVE ALSO NOTES OF EVIDENCE STRONGLY INDICATES THAT THE VICTIM IS NOT JUST A CONDITION OF POVERTY AND IS A CAUSE OF POVERTY. A BIGGER FAMILIES OFTEN WAS CONFESSIONS THEIR CONNECTIONS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR CHILDREN HAVE TO START OVER IN A NEW SCHOOL. LANDLORDS SCREEN OUT PEOPLE ACQUIRE AND EXPENSE OF THESE FAMILIES HAVE AN EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTY GETTING BACK IN THE QUALITY HOUSING. I ONLY KNOW THAT EVICTION CAUSES JOB LOSS AND NOT SURPRISINGLY AND IT'S BEEN SHOWN TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT PEOPLE'S MENTAL. HEALTH SOMETIMES FOR YEARS AFTERWARD. SO HOW THAT COMPARE. FOR CHALLENGES THE FAMILIES FACING HOUSING RESTS ON THE RIGHT AS THE RED MORATORIUM'S LEFT. AND IT IS THE CONTINUING EFFORTS TO INCREASE HOUSING STOCK AND MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE WE ALSO NEED TO HELP PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND AVOID EVICTION. WE SHOULD BE PLANNING AHEAD TO COVER A RARE CHANCE AT LEAST TO THE MINIMUM 25% IN THE STATE OF EXTEND FAR. ALLOWING PEOPLE TO BE AFFECTED AS FAR MORE COSTLY THAN HELPING THEM STAY HOUSE. CEDAR BDA HAS ALSO PUT FORTH A REQUEST FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING. TO BE SPENT OVER TWO YEARS. THE BEST SERVICES AND HOUSING PROGRAMS ARE MEMBERS OPERATE FOR OUR CLIENTS. CALIFORNIA BASED ON SELECTIVELY TO FILL GAPS IN FUNDING AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE ALTERNATIVES. OUR CLIENTS. AND IT'S CRITICAL TO CREATE A MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR PROJECT HUNKY. AS YOU KNOW THE FUNDS PROVIDED IN THE IMMEDIATE EARLY ACTION PACKAGES ARE CONSIDERED ONE TIME. WITH NO GUARANTEE OF CONTINUED FUNDING FOR COUNTIES TO KEEP OPERATING RESULTS. FINALLY HOW CAN OUR PROGRAMS BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE TO PREVENT ADDICTION AND THE OBSTACLES TO DOING THAT. FIRST CONTINUING FUNDING FOR HOUSING PROGRAMS AND ESPECIALLY MAKING A HOMESTAY COMPONENT OF ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PERMANENT AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING THERE BUT I'LL TALK ABOUT MORE IN THE LAST CHANNEL TODAY WILL HELP BOTH IN THE SHORT AND LONGER TERM. AS I NOTED ABOVE THE PREVENTION OF EVICTION IS CRITICAL BUT IT'S NOT SUPPORTED BY ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THEY OPERATE. IN THE POWER SPACE HOUSING SERVICES PROGRAMMER HSP THIS IS A KEY BARRIER UNDER THE DEPARTMENT'S INTERPRETATION OF CARLOCK COUNTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SERVE FAMILIES WHO ARE AT RISK OF ADDICTION UNTIL THEY'RE SERVED WITH AN ACTUAL EVICTION NOTICE. THAT'S PRETTY FAR ALONG IN THE PROCESS AND AT THAT POINT IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND OFTEN SIMPLY TOO LATE TO INTERVENE SUCCESSFULLY. PUTS US IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO HELP THAT FAMILY FIND A NEW PLACE TO LIVE WHICH AS WE TALKED ABOUT TAKES MORE TIME IF WE CAN EVEN FIND A PLACE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD ANOTHER REQUIREMENT UNDER THE STATUTE. AND THIS WORK IS FAR MORE COSTLY THAN JUST HELPING. THEM STAY IN THEIR EXISTING HOME IN THE FIRST PLACE. ALL NEED TO PAY RECKONED ALLOWING LONGER SOMETHING. AS WELL AS MORE. WHEN IT COMES PURCHASING% SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS. TO GIVE IT ALL SOME FAMILIES TIME THEY NEED TO BUILD UP THEIR RESOURCES IN INCOME. TO AVOID BEING CONSTANTLY ON THE BREAK BREAK AND THE NEXT. WE'RE ASKING FOR THESE TWO CRITICAL FLEXIBILITY IS TO BE ADDED TO THE STATUTES ARE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THESE CHANGES ARE KEY TO STABILIZING OUR MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES YOUTH AND OLDER AND DISABLED ADULTS. THANK YOU AND I'MHAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS DURING THE QUESTION TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SOME MOUNT. DIRECTOR OF HOUSING AND HEALTH JOHN BURTON USED. ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY BEFORE I BEGIN MY REMARKS I'D LIKE TO JUST SAY THAT WE AGREE WITH AND SUPPORT THE SUB COMMITTEE REQUEST FOR ISSUE FOR THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED WITHIN THE NEXT PANEL I'M IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S RIGHT ABSOLUTELY TO THE FAMILY FOR CONVENTION BACK. RIGHT NOW TO ROUTE TO TURN TO MY REMARK. CURTAIN FROM ACROSS YOUTH HAVE BEEN DEEP IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. AS YOUNG WORKERS WE'VE BEEN HIT HARDEST BY JOB LOSS. BUT UNLIKE THE 52% OF EIGHTEEN THE TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD LIVING WITH THEIR PARENTS NATIONALLY. BOB DO YOU DO NOT HAVE THE EMOTIONAL ECONOMIC THE COURT DOCKET OF AN EXTENDED FAMILY. IN A TWENTY TWENTY SURVEYS FEWER THAN HALF OF BOX YOU PURPORTED THEY HAD FRIENDS HEATH WORKER OR FAMILY MEMBER TO RELY ON DURING THE PANDEMIC. BLACK OF ASSISTANT HAS HAD DEVASTATING IMPACTS COMPOUNDED OVER TIME. IN A STATEWIDE SURVEY OF CURRENT FORM A BOX YOU CAN CALIFORNIA ONE IN FIVE REPORTED EXPERIENCING AT THE THOUGHT OF HOMELESSNESS IN THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. BOB DO YOU LIVING IN HIGH COST COUNTIES ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC DUE TO THE LACK OF ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING PROGRAM FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM CLASS KNOWN IT'S HUGELY POPULAR. THIS PROGRAM WITH THE STYLISH BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND ONE AT THE URGING OF CALIFORNIANS CONNECTION. AND PROVIDE STATE REPORTED HELPING TO OVER TWELVE HUNDRED YOU ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT TOGETHER WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED OF THEIR CHILDREN. HE THREE PUTTED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE. BUT IT'S INCREASINGLY IT'S INCREASINGLY UNAVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES WITH THE HIGHEST RENTAL CAR. OVER THREE FOURTHS OF CALIFORNIA'S ELEVEN HIGHEST HAWK COUNTIES HAD A DECREASE IN HOUSING CAPACITY. I'M SORRY- AN INCREASE IN HOUSING AND A DECREASE IN HOUSING CAPACITY IN THE LAST DECADE AS COMPARED 239% OF THE LOWER COST COUNTY. INTRODUCTION AND HOUSING CAPACITY COMES AT A TERRIBLE TIME. INSTEAD OF BEING FAKE WE HOUSE DURING THE PANDEMIC FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ARE WAITING. THE MOST RECENTLY AVAILABLE DATA SHOWS THE TOTAL FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ON A PEACH TREE PARK WAIT LET'S STATEWIDE. THE AVERAGE WEIGHT WITH AN ELEVEN HIGHER CROP COUNTY IT'S FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THE AVERAGE AND LOWER COST COUNTY. WHILE THE CHALLENGES ARE DAUNTING CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE POLLUTION. JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOU IT'S LEADING A COALITION OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE ORGANIZATIONS FROM ALL CORNERS CALIFORNIA INCLUDING YOU TO REQUEST EIGHTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE BUDGET TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AMONG CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH DURING THE PANDEMIC AND BEYOND. THIS PROPOSAL INVEST IN WHAT WE KNOW WORK TO KEEP YOU BASICALLY HAVE. FIRST THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AMONG YOUTH CURRENTLY IN FOSTER CARE I TRAINING CHILD WELFARE WORKERS ON HOUSING RESOURCES AND GIVING THEM A NEW TOOL IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ALMOST NOT. HOW THE NAVIGATION. CURRENTLY SOCIAL WORKERS RECEIVE NO TRAINING ON AVAILABLE HOUSING RESOURCES OR HOW TO HELP YOU ACCESS THEM. FOR YOU TO HAVE MORE COMPLEX HOUSING NEEDS BETTER COULD TELL YOUR PARENTS OR YOU COULD DISABILITIES THERE ARE NO DEDICATED RESOURCES TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THE TIGHT THE TIME CONSUMING HOUSING SEARCH PROCESS AND SECURE HOUSING. THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD CHANGE THAT BY TRAINING SOCIAL WORKERS ON HOW THE HOUSING FUNDAMENTAL. AND INVESTING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND THE STATE'S HOUSING NAVIGATORS PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE HOW CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL CHILD WELFARE AGENCY. THIS EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES WORK BEST APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YOUTH ANNUALLY. SECOND THE PROPOSAL WOULD PROTECT FORMER FOSTER YOUTH BY INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING AND PREVENTING THE LACK OF HOUSING CAPACITY AND HIGH COST PARK WITH THE STATE OF THE GRANT EARLIER. IT WOULD DO THIS BY MAKING THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM A PERMANENT ONGOING PROGRAM. IS PROGRAM PRIORITIZES NEUTROPENIC FOSTER CARE JUVENILE PROBATION UNFORTUNATELY IT WILL END ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST JUST ONE BOX YOU NEED IT MOST. THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD REMOVE FIFTY EXTENSION AND IF THIS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE USED ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY IT WOULD BE A VALUABLE RESOURCE TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING COSTS FACED BY AN ESTIMATED THOUSAND YOU VOLUNTARILY REMAINED IN FOSTER CARE PACKAGE TWENTY ONE FOLLOWING ACTION TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE MARKET BUDGET. AS NOTED EARLIER HOUSING WAITING LISTS ARE GROWING FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND HIGH COST COUNTIES OF THE STATE. AND THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE THE WAITING LED BY SABOTAGING A HOUSING SUPPLEMENTS FOR THE T. S. B. COCHRAN GRAHAM IN COUNTIES WITH THE HIGHEST. RENTAL CAR. OKAY BASED ON A POWER A DOCK BY THE- IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND IT WILL ENSURE THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED HOUSING PROGRAM FOR FORMER PROPERTIES IS AVAILABLE WHEN AND WHERE YOU NEED IT MOST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM MIKE HERALD WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- PLEASE BE BACK WITH YOU ONCE AGAIN- FIRST I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT- I WANT TO ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS THAT AND TO SEND A LINK FROM THE- COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS. OF JUST GAVE- I THOUGHT MANY OF HER POINTS WERE VERY WELL TAKEN AND I THINK THERE. ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT WE COULD BE DOING AND- WHAT YOU MIGHT DESCRIBE AS TECHNICAL FIXES TO EXISTING PROGRAM. THAT COULD ALLOW THEM TO WORK BETTER AND SO I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO REALLY GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO THOSE PROPOSALS. ON MY NAME TESTIMONY THOUGH ON THIS PANEL IS THAT. I THINK THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN THE MOST CHALLENGING THAT OUR CLIENTS HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED- LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. HAVE SUFFERED BOTH THE BULK OF THE JOB LOSSES AND HAD THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE KOBE CASES AND DEATHS. ON MANY LOW INCOME WORKERS LOST THEIR JOBS. AND MANY OF THESE JOBS MAY NEVER COME BACK. AND OTHERS LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY LOST THEIR CHILD CARE- SO IT'S BEEN A REALLY DEVASTATING TIME OTHER WORKERS HAVE HAD TO KEEP WORKING AS A CENTRAL WORKERS. EVEN AT THE RISK OF EXPOSING THEMSELVES OR THEIR FAMILIESTO COPE. SO I JUST WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE JUST ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARILY. STRESSFUL TIME THAT. ON LOAN FAMILIES HAVE BEEN THE- TWELVE MONTHS AND PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE GOING FORWARD- AS WE KNOW MILLIONS OF FAMILIES LOST INCOME FROM WORK AND FELL BEHIND IN THEIR RENT AND FELL BEHIND ANOTHER BILLS ALSO. ON THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HEAR FROM CLIENTS IS THAT THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR SAVINGS THEY BORROWED FROM THEIR FAMILY IF THEY COULD. MAYBE EVEN SOLD THEIR BELONGINGS THANK YOU SIR THERE'S BEEN A MAXED OUT THEIR CREDIT CARDS. ALL WANTED HIM TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND PAY SOME OF THE RENT SO THE CAMPER ROF OVER THEIR HEADS FOR THEIR FAMILIES DURING THIS TIME. CUMULATIVELY THE IMPACT OF CODE HAS BEEN FINANCIAL DEVASTATION. AND WE HAVE SEEN A PERIOD OF WEALTH STRIPPING FROM POOR CALIFORNIANS UNLIKE ANYTHING IN RECENT MEMORY- AND I DON'T NEED TO REMIND MOST OF YOU THAT. FOR FAMILIES DIDN'T HAVE MUCH WILL TO STRIP TO BEGIN WITH THEY WERE ALREADY ASSET FOR. BUT THE LITTLE THAT THEY HAVE IN MANY CASES. IS NOW GONE. AND ALL OF THIS LARGELY THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN- AND WHILE INCOMES DROP FOR MANY HOUSEHOLDS COST OFTEN WERE NOT. THERE WERE SHORTAGES OF ITEMS THAT CAUSE PRICES TO SPIKE THEY- THE STATE HOME ORDER MEANT THAT FAMILIES HAD TO RELY ON DELIVERY SERVICES TO GET CENTRAL ITEMS ON SUCH AS FOOD CLOTHES AND OTHER NECESSITIES- THIS MONTH THE MONEY THAT FAMILIES HAVE. IT'S NOT STRETCH AS FAR AS IT USED TO AND MANY FAMILIES WERE SO MANY CHILDREN ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL DEPRIVATION AND TOXIC STRESS DURING THIS TIME. SO. WE I REALLY WOULD I THINK THIS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT POINT HERE COM WE REALLY NEED TO USE THIS MOMENT NOT JUST NOT TO JUST HELP FAMILIES OUT OF THEIR CURRENT TROUBLES AND GOD KNOWS WE NEED TO DO THAT BUT WE NEED TO. IMPORTANT PROPOSALS WHERE WE COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC WITH EVEN LESS POVERTY AND BAM WE WENT INTO IT WITH. WE NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR TEMPORARY FEDERAL MONEY AND ARE FORTUNATE ROBUST STATE RESOURCES- AND REALLY TRY TO GET MONEY INTO FAMILIES POCKETS SO THEY CAN ADDRESS THEIR OWN NEEDS. LITERALLY THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO IS TO GET MONEY TO FAMILIES SO THEY SO THEY CAN REBUILD THEIR LIVES REBUILD THEIR CREDIT AND ALLOW THEM TO ESTABLISH A LEAST SOME SAVINGS SO THEY CAN WITHSTAND THE CHALLENGES THAT WHITE DELIVERS- SO HERE'S A FEW THINGS SPECIFICALLY WE WOULD RECOMMEND. ON THE LEGISLATURE I'M SHOULD INCREASE COWART'S UNNECESSARY GRANTS ON THE STATE COMMITTED TO ENDING CHILDHOOD DEEP POVERTY THREE YEARS AGO BUT WE NEVER FINISHED THE JOB WE SHOULD DO THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE HAVE ONE MORE STEP TO GO TO GET EVERY CHILD IN THE STATE ABOVE 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS EXPLAINED EARLIER THAT'S NOT A STANDARD THAT WE'RE PARTICULARLY WHILE LOVE BUT IT WOULD BE A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP FOR. ON AS A SIGN WE NEED TO RESTORE THE GRANT CUTS FROM THE LAST RECESSION. JUST LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN FROM THE LAST RECESSION NOT THE CURRENT RECESSION FOR MOBILE LAB MANY YEARS AGO TWELVE YEARS AGO AND HAVE STILL NOT BEEN RESTORED. AND WHILE IT'S GREAT THAT WE GOT SNAP BENEFITS TO RECIPIENTS THEY CAN'T SPEND NOW ON PAYING FOR THEIR HOUSING COSTS OR OTHER UTILITIES. SO WE NEED TO GET THOSE GRANTS BACK UP TO WHERE THEY WERE AND BEYOND SO THAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO PAY THEIR BILLS. ON THERE TO CLEAN OF ANY DIRECTOR JOB SITE I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR HER REFERENCE THE ISSUES ABOUT THE DECLINE IN THE S. S. I. CASELOAD. BECAUSE WE REALLY THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE ARE WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF GETTING PEOPLE INTO THE S. S. I. CASELOAD. WE CAN DRAW DOWN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AND MOST OF THIS IS BEING FRANKLY DRIVEN BY A VERY HIGH FEDERAL DENIAL RATE. THAT WE STILL SAW START TO HAPPEN IN THE PREVIOUS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. THE BEST THING WE CAN DO HERE INSTANCE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED LEGAL ADVOCACY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE LEGAL ADVOCACY AVAILABLE FOR RECIPIENTS ARE FOR APPLICANTS EXCUSE ME. ALL THROUGH THE PROCESS RIGHT THROUGH AN APPEAL. WE CAN PUT TOGETHER A PACKAGE OF ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THIS FIRST PURPOSE THAT WOULD BE A VERY EFFECTIVE STRATEGY AND- INCREASING SSI. ON CASE LOADS. ON WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR PASSING THE GOLDEN STATE STATEMENTS IN THE GOLDEN STATE GRANT- IT WAS REALLY SIGNIFICANT THAT WE EXTENDED THESE PAYMENTS TO- TO FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS ON. A PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY IS AS MUCH AS WE SUPPORT THE APC. YOUR FAMILIES DON'T WORK DON'T HAVE INCOME FROM WORK AND DON'T BENEFIT IF WE ONLY PROVIDE BENEFITS TO THE I. T. C. SO WE THINK THAT WAS A REALLY GREAT STEP WE WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE- IF WE DO ANOTHER GOLDEN STATE STEMNESS WHICH MEANS. WHAT YOU KNOW STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT- THAT BE EXTENDED TO PERSONS ON GENERAL SYSTEMS WHO ARE NOT. INCLUDED IN THIS LOOP MOST PREVIOUS FAME. IN THAT WE IN IN. WHO DO HAVE TEN. NUMBER PAYMENTS TO FOLKS DO ABOUT SEND ARE FILE FEDERAL STATE BUT TO THOSE WHO DON'T- BUT WE REALLY THINK PROVIDE. THESE PAYMENTS THESE GOLD SIX SEVEN PAYMENT PERIODICALLY- WOULD REALLY GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING THESE FAMILIES RECOVER. AND WILL HELP BOLSTER THE STATE'S ECONOMY SO WE ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER APPROVING SEVERAL ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE IN THE COMING BUDGET YEAR- AND AS WE KNOW EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC MANY FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THE RENT. AND WE WILL STRUGGLE AGAIN AFTER THE ECONOMY IMPROVED YOU'VE HEARD THE SAME FROM SEVERAL OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS AND IT'S A FACT- AND GIVEN THE RECENT FEDERAL PANDEMIC ASSISTANCE OF THE ROBUST STATE REVENUES AGAIN. WE SHOULD FUND R A STATE FUNDED RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE THE FIRST PRIORITY FOR THIS RENTAL SYSTEMS. WE CAN EASILY IDENTIFY THE HOUSEHOLDS WITH HIGH HOUSING COSTS FOR EXISTING PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS. AND PROVIDE THEM WITH ENOUGH CASH AID EACH MONTH TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RENTS ARE AFFORDABLE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUALLY- PROVIDE EMERGENCY HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS THAT ARE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE FOR US TO DO. AND THEN FINALLY I'LL CLOSE WITH THIS. SB NINETY ONE IT WAS A MILESTONE BILL- WE APPLAUD THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR PASSING IT AND- IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED NOW WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO SEE THE OUTCOMES- AND IT'S GONNA SINCE MANY FAMILIES AVOID EVICTION. BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO HELP RENTERS. IN PARTICULAR WE NEED TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT TENANTS DON'T FACE INFECTIONS IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY 25% OF THE RENT. BY JUNE FIRST. NOW BAR CAL WORKS PROGRAM HAS TO ON PROVISIONS TO IT THAT CAN BE EXTREMELY USEFUL HERE. ONE IS CAO WORKS THE VERSION WHICH IS A VALUABLE SOURCE TO HELP WRITERS WHO ARE NOT ON CAL WORKS BUT WHO NEED- ONE TIME ASSISTANCE. TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE RENT THAT THEY- BUT THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY HAS SOME LIMITATIONS TO PARTICULARLY A CAP ON THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE PROVIDED. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT RAISED. WE ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING TO FAMILIES OF HOW IT WORKS. ON YOUR- KNOWN TO NON RECURRING NEEDS AN EFFECTIVE RECENT PANDEMIC FUNDING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WOULD WOULD BE USEFUL FOR THAT PURPOSE SO YOU KNOW WE ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO MAKE ONE TIME PAYMENTS TO FAMILIES. BUT IN ANY CASE WE NEED TO DO MORE TO MAKE FAMILIES AWARE THAT THIS IS AN OPTION. AND THAT WE- INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE APPLYING FOR THESE FUNDS NOW SO THAT WHEN JUNE COMES JUNE FIRST ROLLS AROUND WE DON'T HAVE FAMILIES GETTING EVICTED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT THE RENT. SO WITH THAT WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THAT CONCLUDES THIS PANEL I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DICE TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS AND- I WILL BEGIN. I FIRST WANT TO- I BEGIN WHERE THE L. A- STATED THAT REQUEST FOR MORE DATA. I WAS HOPING THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD COMMENT- REGARDING- HOW WE CAN DEVELOP THIS DATA FOR OUR ANTI POVERTY PROGRAMS TO ASSIST. WITH PLANNING AND RESPONSIVENESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR KIM JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES SO WE AGREE THAT- WE BET WITH THE START DATE IS NEEDED WE ARE AT. GLAD TO BE PARTNERING WITH THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES HOUSING ON THE H. D. I. SISTER H. D. I. S. SYSTEM. THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND GOING FORWARD- RIGHT NOW IF WE WANT TO THE DECISIONAL AREN'T SHOCKING SYSTEMS RELATED TO DATA FOR. THESE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THOSE WOULD IT REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND RESOURCES ACT CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED BACK. AGAIN WE WILL HAVE SOME INFORMATION- THAT'S ADDITIONAL. I DO WE CAN WE HAVE TODAY IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL DIRECTORY OF THOSE WHO ARE PATHWAY TO PERMANENT HOUSING. IF I CAN THERE WERE A NUMBER OF TIMES WE HEARD WHETER IT WAS WITH EACH TAB FOR HSP OR WITH HOME SAFE ABOUT THE NEED FOR US TO HAVE LONGER TERM SUPPORT. AND WAS HOPING TO GET THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE. IT I WILL JUST START BY SAYING THAT- IN ANY IN ANY PROGRAM AND AS WE THINK ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE HERE TO THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE- THE BROADER AT THE RATE THE BRIGHTER THE ELIGIBILITY ARE AT WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACT OF THAT IS GOING TO BE THE GREATER NEEDS THE TO THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. RELATED TO WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL IS EXPERIENCING- A FICTION EXCEPT AROUND ITS BELT THOSE TRADE OFFS ARE GOING TO BE THAN RELATED TO THEIR RESOURCES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. GRAMS ARE YEAH DETENTION THERE WOULD BE THEN HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING SERVED FOR A LONGER DURATION SHOULD KNOW WHETHER ADDITIONAL FUNDING- BE INCLUDED SO THOSE ARE THE TENSION POINTS ARE RT. THE WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IF WE WERE TO BOTH INCREASED DURATION OR- A CHANGE BROAD KNOWLEDGE ABILITY REQUIREMENTS- FINALLY I WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON C. W. D. A.'S- RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING IMPROVEMENTS OF THE H. S. P. PROGRAM. SPECIFICALLY THEY NEED TO HAVE AN ACTUAL OBJECTION NOTICE OR AGAIN THE LONGER TERM SUBSIDIES JUST HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. SURE SUMMER LOOKS SIMILARLY I WOULD SAY MY RESPONSE IS THE SAME THAT AGAIN IF WE WANT TO BROADEN RIGHT NOW WE ARE AGAIN REALLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT- WE CAN PREVENT THAT THAT ELECTION FOR THE PERSON WHO'S IMMEDIATELY FACING IT. IF WE WERE TO BROADEN ELIGIBILITY AND NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF REQUIREMENTS- THAT WE WOULD LIKELY SEE ADDITIONAL NEEDS- IN SUPPORT AND SO AGAIN EITHER WE'RE GOING TO I ASKED SERVE FEWER PEOPLE OR PEOPLE LONGER- OR AT SERVE A DIFFERENT POPULATION IT NEEDS THE RIGHT NOW WE ARE PRIORITIZING THOSE SECOND IMMINENT RISK ABDUCTION. I THINK WE WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE- WOULD NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE DATA AND- FOR GAP ANALYSIS BECAUSE IT SOUNDS AS IF YOU'RE OPERATING UNDER THE SAME RESOURCES AND- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH NEED THERE IS OUT THERE AND WHETHER OR NOT OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE BEING RESOURCE APPROPRIATELY AND SO. I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR US ASKING SO MANY QUESTIONS- I WOULD LIKE TO ELEVATE THE- JOHN BURTON. ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE TRACKS LOOKING AT TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH AS THEY ARE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO HOMELESSNESS. BUT I'D LIKE TO END MY QUESTIONS TODAY IF I COULD WITH THE- BUDGET BILL PROPOSAL. FOR RCF FEES I'M- AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE TRACKED AT HOME IT'S ON PAGE FIFTY EIGHT OF THE AGENDA. AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FIFTY EIGHT AND HAD STATED THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACILITIES THAT CURRENTLY ARE NOT TAKING SSI RSS P. RECIPIENTS. AND SINCE WE ARE. GOING TO BE INVESTING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND PUBLIC RESOURCES. IS THERE A WAY FOR US TO HELP THESE FACILITIES TO INCENTIVIZE THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TAKEN CARE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS AS WELL. GREATLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION I THINK YES THAT'S PART OF PART OF THE- INVESTMENTS IN THESE FACILITIES WOULD BE AN EXPECTATION. ADD TO SERVICE THE POPULATION THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING AND SO THAT'S ABSOLUTELY HOW WE INTEND FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK OUT. I INVITE MY COLLEAGUES HERE CRIME YOU CAN AND ASK TO JOIN TO ADD ANY MORE TO THAT QUESTION. YEAH ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO JUST ADD THAT ON THE MECHANISM FOR DOING SO. IS ENVISIONED TO BE THROUGH USING USE RESTRICTIONS OR COVENANTS THAT WOULD. REQUIRE AN ENTITY THAT RECEIVED STATE FUNDS TO COMMIT TO SERVING OUR PRIORITY POPULATION- THAT OVER THE LONG TERM TO MEET. THE QUESTION THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK THE PANEL BUT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD I WOULD AGAIN LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S REQUEST THAT ARE MADE WITHIN THE AGENDA AT THE END OF ISSUE THREE AT THE TOP OF PAGE SIXTY ONE WHICH ARE FIRST US ASKING THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE OPTIONS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF POSSIBLE PROGRAM EXPANSIONS FOR ALL OF ITS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS SECOND TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE DRAFT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. RELATED TO ITS OUR CFE PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE LEGISLATURE BY MID APRIL AND THE LANGUAGE SHOULD LAY OUT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE USE OF FUNDS THE EXPECTED RESULTS AND OTHER OUTCOME INFORMATION TO TRACK THE PROGRESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PROPOSED INVESTMENT AND FINALLY WE ASK FOR THE COMMITTED EFFORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO COLLECT THAT DATA ABOUT HOUSING INSECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS IN OUR CASE LOAD SO THAT. WE CAN HAVE THAT INFORMATION CAN I ASK IF THERE IS ANY FEEDBACK OR REACTION AT THIS TIME FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO THESE REQUESTS. THANK YOU AT CHAIR THE ONLY ONE I WOULD ASK FOR OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COLLEAGUES TO SPEAK TO WOULD BE THE REQUEST NUMBER TWO RELATED TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I DO FOR THAT THAT ONE TO OUR- COLLEAGUES THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. YES THANK YOU JUST INCREASED MARTHA FINANCE- I THINK WE'LL JUST REITERATE SOME OF THE COMMENTS WERE MADE EARLIER REGARDING PROPOSALS THAT. AT THIS TIME THE ADMINISTRATION DOES ANY ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS HERE- SO IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS SOMETHING AS SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HOUSING- WANTS TO CEMENT A LINE OR SHARE WITH US IS A LIST OF PRIORITIES- WE CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE- BUT IT. FOR REQUESTING DRAFT LANGUAGE OF THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO PROPOSED AT THIS TIME IT MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE IF FIVE ALLEGE THE BASS OFFICE MIGHT ASSIST RESIDENTS OR OTHERS. WOULD BE MY COMMENT ON THAT. HAVING A HARD TIMES IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY WOULDN'T. WANT TO PUT OUT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD GO WITH THIS REQUEST AND INSTEAD WOULD ASK THE L. A- TO DO THAT SO. I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP OFFLINE BUT IT WOULD SEEM APPROPRIATE FOR. THE ADMINISTRATION TO HELP US WITH THIS TASK SINCE IT WAS YOUR PROPOSAL. HOW DO YOU TAKE THAT BACK AGAIN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE BUT WE'LL TAKE THAT. BACK FOR CONSIDERATION- BUT AGAIN- HAPPY TO CONTINUE LOOKING AND WORKING ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED- WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH PANEL THREE WE WILL NOW MOVE ON THE PANEL FOR ON EQUITY DRIVEN CARE FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SERVED BY THE CHILD WELFARE AND FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. WE WILL HAVE NINE PANELISTS FOR ISSUE FOR WHICH WILL BEGIN WITH KIM JOHNSON THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. DIRECTOR JOHNSON CAN YOU PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS CAN JOHNSON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AT THE QUESTION. AB CLOSED IN THE AGENDA IS RELATED TO THE TRENDS AND THOUGHTS WE'VE SEEN. IN TERMS OF CHILD WELFARE REFERRALS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND AS MANY OF THE PANELISTS AT SO FAR. HAVE STATED THE TREMENDOUS A CHALLENGING BURDEN THAT- USE. OUR FAMILIES HAVE FACED- IS ABSOLUTELY SIGNIFICANT SO APPS ONE OF THE FACT THAT- AS IT WAS SPECIFICALLY RELATES TO CHILD WELFARE SERVICES WE DID- SEE A PRETTY IMMEDIATE. THE CLIENT AND THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS THAT WERE RECEIVED TO THE CHILD WELFARE HOTLINE. IN MARCH ABOUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR MARCH APRIL OF LAST YEAR IT WAS DOWN FORTY PERCENT- AND- WHAT WE ATTRIBUTE THAT TO IS THE CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS WE S. SIMILARLY SAW A DECLINE IN. THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS WHO WERE REFERRING USE AND SO- WHILE WE AND IN THE RECENT MONTHS WE HAVE SEEN- THAT THAT REFERRAL NUMBERS COMING BACK CLOSER TO PRE PANDEMIC RATES. BUT THEY REMAIN APPROXIMATELY 20% LOWER THAN THEY WERE LAST YEAR. IN TERMS AGAIN THEN OF WHO IS REPORTING MORE SECOND I'M A MENTION THAT TEACHERS. HAVE ALSO HAD A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN REPORTING. WE HAVE SEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AS THE PRIMARY- ARE MANDATED REPORTER OF THESE REFERRALS WITH AGAIN. AT SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THAT SPACE ONE OF BACK- TOOLS AND WE WORKED OUT WITH THE PARTS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON THIS TOOL WAS TO PROVIDE. TEACHERS EDUCATORS SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS. TIPS RESOURCES ON. WAYS THEY COULD POTENTIALLY SUPPORT THE CHILDREN BUT ALSO SEE. AN RECOGNIZE DIFFERENCES SIGNS I INTERVIEW LOOKING BACK HAVE A THAT HOW DO A- HOW THEY'RE IN. REALLY WHEN THEY WORRIED ABOUT STUDENT. WHO MADE EITHER IS PARTICIPATING M. OR- OTHER THINGS THAT THEY COULD LOOK FOR AB ACCENT RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE AGAIN PARTNERED WITH THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION ACT TO RELEASE. WE OBVIOUSLY- HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH A NUMBER OF PARTNERS ON- IMPROVING THAT THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OF FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA THAT WAS A PREPLANNED DIMMICK. AT CHALLENGE- THAT WE WERE WORKING TO ADDRESS OF COURSE I WITH THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES LIKE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WHICH IS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCE INTO DISTRICTS I WOULD HIRE A PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION. BUT CERTAINLY WE KNOW AS WE ARE CONCERNED WITH MANY OF OUR OUR STUDENTS THIS POPULATION OF YOUTH WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO FULLY WRAP AROUND AND SUPPORT- AS WE RECOVER FROM THIS EFFORT AND SO- I THINK IT'S A PLACE WHERE WE WANT TO BE REALLY FOCUSED OUT CERTAINLY WE HAVE SEEN. AN INCREASE ABSENTEEISM- AND SOME OTHER CHALLENGES THAT THE YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE SO I ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT WE- WANT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR OF COURSE NOT ONLY RECOGNIZING THE SIGNS OF ABUSE BUT ALSO THE PREVENTION SO MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN HAVING. AN EARLIER PANELS AGAIN I'LL MENTION THAT THEY CAO WORKS AT HOME VISITING. PROGRAM AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE WE AND OUR FAMILIES ARE DEALING WITH SUCH STRESSORS WHERE ARE THE TOUCH POINTS FOR RELATIONSHIPS THE CONNECTIONS THAT THEY CAN HAVE IN COMMUNITIES TO SEEK HELP WE DID RESOURCE AND NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS EARLY ON AGAIN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN SUPPORT SO THESE ARE. OUR RESOURCES FOR THE CARE GIVERS THE RESOURCE FAMILY HOMES- WE PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL CASH IN IN SUPPORT WE HAD ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS AND COMMUNITIES TO BE ANOTHER GOOD AT. BAT. PARTNER I WITH THEM LEASING GET- IN THE THAT NEED. AT AT CARE OF AND THEN OF A AND EMERGENCY. FOR CALPERS OUT HOT WHY. FOR THOSE WHO WORKS. STE I'M OF COURSE- SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS FOR THOSE AT TRADITIONAL AG WHO WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE AGED OUT OF FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. I'M IN CEMEX AND SOME ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES TO AGAIN PROVIDE THE IMMEDIATE NEED WE'VE HAD A NUMBER AND I AM PRIVILEGED. I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF PLACES AND SPACES TO TALK WITH RESOURCE FAMILIES TO TALK WITH YOU. ABOUT THEIR NEEDS AND AGAIN I WOULD JUST SAY THIS IS A PLACE WHERE WILL HAVE CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN SUPPORT WE DO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS. RECENTLY RECEIVED IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW CHEEKY IS ONE OF THOSE PLANS SOURCES THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN ADD TO PLAY VERY QUICKLY TO GET. NEEDS MET IMMEDIATELY FOR FOSTER YOUTH SO AGAIN IN TERMS OF THE SCHOOL AT SPACE AND THE REFERRAL SPACE AS CERTAINLY THOSE CHANGES. THAT WERE EXPERIENCED AND WE WILL BE FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING OUR USE AS BOTH SCHOOLS RE OPENED AND OUT WE SEE. ADDITIONAL NEED A RESOURCE FAMILIES. THANK DIRECTOR WE WE'LL HEAR FROM GROW ROWE THIS. DIRECTOR OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION FOR THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THANK YOU CHAIR OF MEMBERS GREG ROSE AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT- YOU'VE ASKED ME TO SPEAK TO A TO A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS- IT- IN THE AGENDA ALL DO ALL OBVIOUSLY DO THAT AT A FAIRLY. HIGH LEVEL BUT IT WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- WE REMAIN AVAILABLE TO YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE L. A. O. I TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO TAKE AND- DEEPER- OUTSIDE OF THAT THE HEARING. FIRST QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED IT HAD TO DO WITH- SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT- THAT DIRECTOR JOHNSON SPOKE TO JUST A MINUTE AGO WITH RESPECT TO- SOME FINDING. THAT THAT WE PUT IN PLACE IN THE IN THE SPRING OF LAST YEAR AND THE QUESTION WAS BY OUR COUNTY IS CONTINUING TO USE GINGER SOME OF THOSE ACTIVITIES. AND WHEN I WOULD JUST NO ONE IS THAT THESE WERE LARGELY AFTER TIME CONSIDERED YOU KNOW KIND OF ONE TIME ALTHOUGH THE MANY OF THEM ARE ARE PROPOSED AGAIN FOR THAT. BUDGET YEAR AT. THE BUDGET YOU'RE AS AS A DIRECTOR JOHNSON MENTIONED- BUT THEY WERE LARGELY- SHORT TERM KIND. AND DEPARTMENTS MANAGED THE- IT MINISTER MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS- WE HAVE A LONG SIDE WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES WHO. PROVIDED A NUMBER OF- SUPPORTED ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CASE WORK AND TO US ASSISTING. FAMILIES TO ACTUALLY- BENEFIT FROM SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS. WE STATED THAT DECK DECK THE COUNTIES ARE CONTINUING TO- TO DO THE CASE WERE RESPONSIBILITIES- THAT THAT THEY'VE HAD AND THEY ARE- ALSO IT. IN THE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE- LINKAGES AT CHIU EXISTING RESOURCES NEW ONES THAT HAVE POPPED UP RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC AND OTHERS FROM FEDERAL FUNDING- AND IF THEY CONTINUE TO FIGHT TO FIGHT TO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF RESOURCES INCLUDING- YOU KNOW CASE WORK RESOURCES. TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WHAT OR WHO WOULD OR OTHERWISE AGE OUT OF OUR EXTENDED FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THE NEXT QUESTION YOU ASK REALLY HAS SPEAKS TO AN UPDATE ON OUR CONTINUING CARE REFORM AND SPECIFICALLY AROUND THAT CHALLENGE. ADOLESCENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT TRAVELING DOWN THE TEAMS AND THE LEVEL OF CARE. A PROTOCOL THAT WE PUT IN PLACE WE JUST NOTE HERE ALSO THAT A GREAT NOT MUCH OF THE DETAIL- INCLUDING SOME FAIRLY SOME TRENDS AND DETAILS STATISTICS ARE IN OUR- R. C. C. R. OVERSIGHT REPORT THAT WE PUBLISHED. OUR REGULARLY AND THAT WE MEET WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF ON ON- WITH WITH SOME FREQUENCY THE MOST RECENT REPORT SHOULD BE READ- IT SHOULD BE- PUBLISHED IN THE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS- SO THAT MUCH OF THE DETAILS- WE CAN DIG INTO WITH THAT REPORT COMES OUT SH THAT'S IN THE HEADLINES REALLY FOR- FOR CFT AND CABINS ARE. THAT. YOU KNOW AS THE AS THE AS THE- AS THE QUESTION SUGGESTS THESE ARE FUNDED. TO THE SEC ARE- REFORM EFFORTS AND THEY ARE FOUNDATIONAL TO THE OUTCOMES THAT- AND SCHEDULES FOR PRACTITIONERS OF CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. WITH THAT SAID- I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT AT THE END OF AUGUST. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WE HAD A TOTAL OF FORTY NINE COUNTIES THAT HAD OPTED INTO- USING THE AUTOMATED PLATFORM THAT WE CREATED TO. TO GATHER I THE CARE IS INFORMATION THAT ARE I'M SORRY THE CANS INFORMATION THAT'S THE THAT THE CHILD AND ADOLESCENCE NEEDS AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT ON THE OTHER LINE COUNTIES ARE EITHER LARGELY RELYING ON THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERS WHICH WILL SPEAK ABOUT IN JUST A MOMENT OR- HAVE. HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE. TO GATHER THE DATA. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL COUNTIES TO IT TOO- MAKE CARES LIVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. I SHOULD NOTE THAT. DURING THAT pTHERE WAS A THERE WAS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN CANCER ASSESSMENTS AND AT PRESENT THERE ARE ABOUT TWENTY SIX HUNDRED A LITTLE OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED IN PROCESS AND SO- FOR A TOTAL SINCE THE ACCOUNT WAS IMPLEMENTED OUT OF NEARLY. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ASSESSMENTS BY A CHILD WELFARE- WORKFORCE HERE'S A SIMILAR NUMBER A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER THAT WAS AT THAT HAVE BEEN. CONDUCTED BY HEARTBEAT BY THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- WORKFORCE EITHER THAT THE COUNTIES THEMSELVES OR THEIR CONTRACTORS AND THE AND THE APARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT. OF SOCIAL SERVICES CAN WORK TOGETHER ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ASSESSMENTS ARE AVAILABLE TO BOTH WORKFORCE IS TO BOTH- THAT CHILD WELFARE AND THE CLINICAL WORK FORCE- NO MATTER WHO I DID THE ASSESSMENT AND SO- THAT WORK IS. STILL ONGOING- AND THE TRENDS FOR CANCER ADMINISTRATION ARE- ARE ARE. INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY- ON. THE OTHER THING I WOULD NOTE AS A AS A TRANSITION TO TALK ABOUT THE LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF CARE ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT. IS WORKING. ON IT- IT. IN PARTNERING WITH SOME COUNTY ON A TO SEE OF TOOL USING- AND- LARGELY ADVOCATES SEEM TO BE- VERY- SUPPORT OF THIS KIND OF TESTING ALL SPEAK TO A LITTLE BIT OF THAT- IN THE MOMENTS TO COMMENT. WITH RESPECT TO THE LEVEL OF CARE- PROTOCOL- SHOULD ALWAYS JUST NOTE THAT WE HAVE A- LOT OF THE LEVEL OF CARE PROTOCOL AS PART OF OUR INTERIM RATES- PROCESS AND AS SUCH- WE ARE WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED IN PHASES IN THE CURRENT PHASE IS. TO GO TO FINISH GOING COMPLETELY STATEWIDE- BEGINNING APRIL FIRST OF THIS YEAR- THAT WILL ALLOW. ALL FAMILIES NO MATTER WHETHER WHETHER THEY'RE SERVE THEIR THEIR- CERTIFIED AND APPROVED FROM A FROM A MONSTER FAMILY AGENCY WHETHER THEIR RELATIVE CAREGIVERS OR WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN APPROVED THROUGH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES. TO TO BENEFIT FROM. THE LEVEL OF CARE PROTOCOL. WE MASON SHE TO THE PROTOCOL- AB DURING THAT THE THAT KOBE TIME PERIOD. MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN AND- SUGGESTED- BY OUR ADVOCATE- COLLEAGUES AND SOME ARE RELATED DIRECTLY TO THAT- ISSUES THAT FAMILIES AND CAREGIVERS AND YOUNG PEOPLE FACE RELATIVE TO A DISTANCE LEARNING THE LACK OF SOME SOCIAL RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY TAKEN INTO. SO THE CURRENT. ITERATION OF THE LOCAL THE LEVEL OF CARE PROTOCOL- WILL- CONTINUE TO GO LIVE UP. IN THE NEXT IS IT NEXT MONTH WE'RE STILL FINISHING UP TO SOME TRAINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITHOUT WITH- MORE ON THAT IN OUR SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF. SHOULD NOTE THAT WE HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERIM NATURE ABOUT THE DEATH OF THE LOW LEVEL OF CARE PROTOCOL SH WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT USING THE INFORMATION THAT COMES FROM THE KANSAS ASK MET. THROUGH A DECISION SUPPORT TOOL AND LOOKING AT ITS VIABILITY RELATIVE TO- INFLUENCING. THAT THE RATE SETTING PROCESS AND SO ON WE WILL BE WORKING WITH NINE COUNTIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES TO TEST OUT OF THAT THAT THE- ALGORITHM THE PROCESS. OVER THE NEXT SIX TO NINE MONTHS. NEXT QUESTION YOU ASKED SPECIFICALLY HAS TO DO WITH THAT THE FAMILY FIRST PRESERVATION SERVICES ACT OFTEN KNOWN AS ACTIVE PSA- ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE PREVENTION SERVICES AND- SOME OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. WE JUST HIGHLIGHTED. FOR FOLKS WHO MAY NOT BE. STEVE DID AS AS MANY ARE THE FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT WHEN IT SPEAKS OF PREVENTION IT'S SPEAKING OF PREVENTION INTO FOSTER CARE AND ARE USING A CRITERIA OF CANDIDACY SO THAT IT IN OTHER WORDS THAT- THIS THIS AND THIS. FEDERAL ACT IN THE FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH ART ARMED RELATIVELY NARROWLY FOCUSED ON AVOIDING YOUNG PEOPLE COMING INTO FOSTER CARE WITH- AND IF THE SYSTEM IF THE IF THERE ISN'T A PARTICULAR INTERVENTION THAT THEY WOULD END UP IN FOSTER CARE- IT- EMINENTLY. AND SO I JUST WHEN I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE PREVENTION WORK AND THOUGHT STATE THAT WE HAVE THAT COUNTIES HAVE THAT STATE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HAVE THE NIGHT OF THE LEGISLATURE SHARES AND- ACTUALLY. MOVING THE SYSTEM- MOVING OUR RESOURCES. FARTHER UPSTREAM. THE AND PSA- DOES IT IS A VERY NARROW SLICE OF THAT AND AS IT IS IT'S AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM THAT. STATES CAN OPT IN OPT INTO WITHOUT SETTING UP THE INTENTION OF THE- OF THE TRAILER BILL IS REALLY TO- READ IS TO LOOK FOCUSED ON THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AROUND USING EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS. AND ACT AND TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF THE STATE TO DO EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS AT THE AS DETERMINED BY. THE CLEARING HOUSE THE FEDERAL CLEARING HOUSE SIMILARLY IT'S AND- IT'S THAT THAT THE TRAILER BILL- PUTS FORTH AT THE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO. LEVERAGE AND BRAID EXISTING- AND OTHER FUNDING ALONGSIDE WITH THESE NEW FEDERAL RESOURCES ALSO SO FUNDING- FOR EXAMPLE LIKE PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES THAT COMMUNITY BASED CHILD ABUSE. PREVENTION ACT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT LOCAL LOCAL REVENUE FUNDS AT CETERA SH BUT IN ESSENCE. THE DEED THESE FUNDS WOULD BE. IN TANDEM WITH FUNDS TO SERVE THE WORK. I WOULD SAY ALSO JUST TO THE TRAILER BILL ALSO SPEAKS TO THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT THAT THAT THAT THAT THE START OFF BY TITLE FORTY FUNDS ARE THE PAYER OF LAST RESORT. AND THEREFORE REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK- SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THAT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THERE'S A MECHANISM IN PLACE TO IDENTIFY- WHERE- SOME OF THESE- WHERE WHERE MEDICAID MEDIC CAL MIGHT BE. ALREADY THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR SOME OF THESE SERVICES. WELL THE GENERAL FUND IS AND IS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL- WE CAN WE MUST WORK WITH THE COUNTY AND WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN IN ESTABLISHING A PLAN THAT MAKES SENSE FOR CALIFORNIA AND THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- GENERAL. THE NEXT QUESTION YOU HAD WAS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT OUR PROCESS RELATED TO- MODIFYING AND- THE TRAILER BILL AS IT FROM ITS OPEN FROM ITS ORIGINAL. ITERATION IF YOU SH AND I SAY THAT JUST KNOW THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT DURING THE DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE. AN INTERNSHIP PROCESS WITH- STAKEHOLDERS TO- TO REFINE THE LANGUAGE AS WE GO FORWARD AND TO THAT END UP WITH- WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS AND IN THE ATTIC AND RESULT IN THE MOST RECENT CONVERSATION. ENDED WITH US HAVING ASKING STAKEHOLDERS A BROAD BASE OF STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. AND WE S- WITH. RELATED TO THIS TRAILER BILL AND THAT INFORMATION CAME IN THIS WEEK WE ARE PROCESSING IT AND WE'RE DEVELOPING AN OUTWARDLY FACING- WEBSITE- THAT WILL INCLUDE- TIMELINES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL ENGAGE. FINALLY THE LAST QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED ME TO SPEAK TO WAS- PRESSING NEEDS IT FOR USE IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM RELATED TO CO TWO CODED A SPECIFICALLY AND WITH SOME QUESTIONS AROUND- EMERGENCY PLACEMENTS. IT'S CENTER OUT. I SAY THAT- A DIRECTOR JOHNSON OR TALKED ABOUT MANY OF THESE THINGS MANY OF THOSE ISSUES- EARLIER BUT I WOULD SAY WITH WITH RESPECT SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO EMERGENCY PLACEMENTS THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH ITS LICENSING ARM AND THROUGH THAT DARK CHOCOLATE COUNTY SERVICES DIVISION WORK WITH A NUMBER OF COUNTIES TO- ADD BASED ON SOME FLEXIBILITY IS AT WORK- UP THE PROVIDED IN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO. TO QUICKLY LICENSE- ALTERNATIVES AND DICK AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES FOR- SOME COUNTIES THAT WERE HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE RIGHT MICROBIT- AND WE WERE IN HIS HAND IN HAND RECOUNT PLEASE ON THAT CLEARLY- REGENCY RESOURCES PLACE RESOURCES WERE IN AND YOU KNOW UNLIMITED SUPPLY PRIOR TO COLD AND THE AND THE PANDEMIC EXACERBATES EXACERBATE AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY SANTA ASSOCIATION TO TRY TO. MEET THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF ANY COUNTIES- AS THEY BROUGHT. THEM UP WITH. WE ALSO JUST SAY THAT KNOW THE- THE THANK YOUNG IT. HOW HOW HOW TO CONTINUE TO HAVE NEEDS OF pAND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE YOUNG ADULTS WHO HAVE AGED OUT OF FOSTER CARE- ALL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE LINKAGES FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND LINKAGES TO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NOW SOME OF OUR PROPOSALS AND IN THE PROJECT. LASTLY I'D SAY OUR SECOND TO LAST I'D SAY THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE WAY WE KNOW THAT WHAT WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO SECURE SURVEYS OF CARE GIVERS AND WE HAVE DONE SOME SURVEYS OF CARE GIVERS ON LARGELY WHAT WHAT DATE THEY TELL US THEY NEED IS- IS. OUR DAY CARE. AT THE PRETTY OF DAY CARE RESPITE SO SIMPSON AB BECAUSE OF THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES OUT. OF HOME SCHOOLING- DOING- SUPPORTING A TELE THERAPIES OF MANY KINDS AND- AND NOT HAVING SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN AVAILABLE ON CAMPUSES AND IN COMMUNITIES AND SO. DAY CARE CHIU DURING- DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOCIAL AND RECREATIONAL. PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED. THE FINAL THING I LIKE TO KNOW IS THAT- COUNTY TO TEND TO SAY THAT THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM- BUT TO THE FACT- AND WAS IMPLEMENTED. ON THAT A TWO WEEKS AGO ON MARCH FIRST AND EVEN IN THIS RELATIVELY SHORT TIME OF TWO WEEKS WE HAVE. GOT A NUMBER OF SUCCESSES A HANDFUL OF SUCCESSES I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY IN TERMS OF CARE GIVERS IN YOUNG PEOPLE'S NOTING THAT WITHOUT THAT- THAT- THE STABILITY OF THEIR OF THE PLACEMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN JEOPARDY AND SO. ON WE'RE HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT PROGRAM COME UP AND STILL THIS NATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT. TIME WITHOUT- ALL ALL PAS. AND OUR TECHNICIANS ARE AT THE END OF THE CAPITAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NO. WE'LL HEAR FROM AND- SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS ANALYSTS ARE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- ASSOCIATE IN YOUR AGENDA THE FIRST QUESTION WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO RESPOND TO TODAY IS TO IDENTIFY THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE PROPOSALS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON FUNDED FOR CHILD WELFARE SERVICES FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- BUT THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. I'M YOU HEARD DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND ASSISTANT DIRECTOR ROSE- TOUCH ON SOME OF THESE- JUST TO RECAP IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY THE ADMINISTRATION PUT IN PLACE A NUMBER OF PANDEMIC RESPONSE ACTIVITIES WITH THE CHILD WELFARE. THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND THE LEGISLATURE- SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED THOSE ACTIVITIES THROUGH THE SECTION THIRTY SIX LETTER PROCESS- OF THE TABLE ON PAGE SEVENTY ONE OF YOUR AGENDA. JUST TO RECAP QUICKLY THEY INCLUDE CASH CARDS FOR FAMILIES AT RISK OF ENTERING FOSTER CARE FUNDING FOR FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS. STATE CONTRACTS FOR LAPTOPS AND CELL PHONES AS WELL AS SUPPORT HOTLINES FOR FOSTER YOUTH AND FAMILIES- UP FOSTER PAYMENT RATE FLEXIBILITY IS FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES IMPACTED DIRECTLY BY CORBETT. GROUP WHO WILL FUNDING FOR EMERGENCY CARE GIVERS MY BEST A RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL APPLICATION PENDING BEYOND ONE YEAR. AND FINALLY FLEXIBILITY AS EXPANSIONS FOR NON MINOR DEPENDENTS AND FORMER NINE NINE MINOR DEPENDENTS. WHO WOULD HAVE AGED OUT OR OTHERWISE LOST ELIGIBILITY. FOR EXTENDED FOSTER CARE BENEFITS. WITH THE X. OF THAT LAST ITEM FOR NON MINOR DEPENDENTS ALL OF THE DIRECT PAYMENTS TO FAMILIES THAT WERE THAT WERE IN PLACE ONLY FROM APRIL THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND THEN RATE FLEXIBILITY AS WORK SENATOR SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY BUT IN OTHER WORDS ASIDE FROM THE FUNDING FOR NON MINOR DEPENDENCE. ALL OF THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE ACTIVITIES INVOLVING DIRECT PAYMENTS TO FAMILIES ENDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CALENDAR YEAR. BUT NOW AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AFTER TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED TO RE LAUNCH- THOSE SUPPORTS WITHIN THE CURRENT YEAR SPECIFICALLY FROM JANUARY THROUGH JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WE WOULD NOTE HOWEVER TO THE BEST OF OUR UNDERSTANDING THE ADMINISTRATION- IS STILL WORKING TO IDENTIFY A FUNDING MECHANISM. TO BE ABLE TO AUTHORIZE THOSE ACTIVITIES- IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND AT THIS POINT THEY ARE NOT TAKING PLACE. WE'RE GOING ON- THE SECOND POINT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS- IS TO DESCRIBE ISSUES WE RAISED AROUND SUPPORT FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES AND TEST YOUR TPS DURING THE PANDEMIC. IN A RECENT ANALYSIS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S CHILD WELFARE BUDGET PROPOSALS. WE RAISED THE POINT THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL OR ALTERNATIVE PANDEMIC SUPPORTS WITHIN CHILD WELFARE. A SPECIFICALLY THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY DIRECT SUPPORT FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES AND S. T. R. T. P.'S THROUGH MONTHLY RATE SUPPLEMENTS. SUCH SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ARE PROCESSED CAREGIVERS AND PROVIDERS WITH THE HIGHER COSTS OF PROVIDING FOSTER CARE DURING THE PANDEMIC OF FOR EXAMPLE FOR FOOD UTILITIES- AND CHILD CARE. AND REALLY JUST HELP OF PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES MITIGATE ANY OTHER ADVERSE ECONOMIC IMPACTS. THEY MAY BE FACING DURING THE PANDEMIC. BOTH RESOURCE AND AS YOUR T. PROVIDE ESSENTIAL CARE FOR OUR STATE'S FOSTER YOUTH AND ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO MANAGE INCREASED COSTS IN LIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC- COULD HELP THE STATE RETAINED AS THE CENTRAL SUPPLY OF CARE GIVERS. THAT ARE CRITICAL TO ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION OF CCR. AND THEN FINALLY THE THIRD QUESTION WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS IS PROVIDER ASSESSMENTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S OF PSA TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. IN RSS MANDAEAN MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIRED TO PROVISIONS OF FF PSA WHICH AGAIN IS THE FEDERAL FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT- TO THE BEST OF OUR UNDERSTANDING THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE ALIGNS WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT OUR STATE MUST MEET. BY OCTOBER FIRST OF THIS YEAR IN ORDER TO CONTINUE RECEIVING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS. THAT SAID WE DO A NUMBER OF MORE TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS ABOUT SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL I WISH WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS- TO MORE FULLY UNDERSTAND. IN ADDITION WE HAVE SOME HIGHER LEVEL POLICY QUESTIONS. NAMELY REGARDING ACTIVITIES AIMED AT PREVENTING ENTRY INTO FOSTER CARE WHICH UNDER F. PSA WILL BECOME NEWLY ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL TITLE FORTY FUNDING- WE NOTE THAT- AND AS THE ADMINISTRATION MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY ON THIS PANEL. CURRENTLY THE PROPOSAL IS THAT COUNTIES COULD IMPLEMENT PREVENTION SERVICES AT THEIR OPTION- BUT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT PROPOSE ANY GENERAL FUND RESOURCES FOR THIS PURPOSE. OFFER US IMPLEMENTING PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AS A COUNTY OPTION- RAISES SOME EQUITY CONCERNS NAME ALLEVIATE SOME COUNTY IS- MAY NOT IMPLEMENT ANY OPTIONAL ACTIVITIES DUE TO LOCAL BUDGET CONSTRAINTS OR JUST DIFFERENT LOCAL PRIORITIES. AND AS A RESULT FAMILIES IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES WOULD THEN BE RECEIVING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SERVICE AND SOME CHILDREN MAY NOT RECEIVE THE BENEFITS- THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF PREVENTION SERVICES AND THEREFORE COULD BE MORE LIKELY TO ENTER INTO FOSTER CARE. US SO TO CONCLUDE IN LIGHT OF THE NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING TECHNICAL AND JUST FROM A POLICY QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE- ALONG WITH QUESTIONS WHICH I BELIEVE YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT FROM OTHERS SPEAKERS ON THIS PANEL REGARDING F. OF PSA. WE THINK THAT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS ON PAGE SEVENTY SIX OF YOUR AGENDA. TO CONVENE A WORKING GROUP- TO HELP INFORM UPDATED AT THE FEET OF PSA TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE MAKES SENSE AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S- EXPRESSED OPENNESS TO WORKING WITH US AND STAKEHOLDERS JUNE TWO AMENDS THIS LANGUAGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JUSTIN FREE TOSS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES DOESN'T REDUCE THE PROMINENT% FINANCE- GO AHEAD AND START ADDRESSING THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE. REQUESTED FOR FINANCE RESPONSE ON PAGE SIXTY THREE. I THINK- M. MY COUNT MY COLLEAGUE OVER THE L. A. O. PROVIDED A- BASICALLY MY RESPONSE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU FOR QUESTION ONE REGARDING. THE CURRENT YEAR FUNDING AUGMENTATION PROPOSED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WERE SO THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING A FUNDING MECHANISM TO AUGMENT. THE DEPARTMENTS BUDGETS PROVIDE EASE AND AS ONE IS- IDENTIFIED WILL COMMUNICATE THAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. MMHM WITH REGARDS TO QUESTIONS WHO ARE RELATED TO THE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE I DATE THAT IT'S- WAS- INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THE EXTENSION OF. NON MY NON MINOR DEPENDENT FUNDING FOR NON MIND INDEPENDENCE THAT THEY TURN TWENTY ONE AND BEYOND- I THINK THAT THE SIMPLE RESPONSE FOR THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION KIND OF TOOK THIS APPROACH ACROSS FROM ON THE BOARD ON MANY OF THE PANDEMIC. RELATED PROPOSALS- THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT ARE AT THE TIME OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS MADE THAT. THE DECEMBER DEADLINE WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE DATE FOR. LOOKING AT THE PANDEMIC IS POTENTIALLY ENDING- WITH THE QUESTION OF WHAT SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED TO HELP YOU PREPARE FOR THE TRANSITION INTO INDEPENDENCE. JUST REMIND- THAT COMMITTEE THAT RESPONSIBILITY OF THESE ACTIVITIES WAS INCLUDED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENTS- AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AROUND EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION TOTAL FUNDS. ON SEVEN HUNDRED AND GENERAL FUND FOR CHILD WELFARE SERVICE ACTIVITIES INCLUDING- THE SUPPORT FOR NOW MINOR DEPENDENTS WOULD BE THE- EXTENDED FOSTER CARE PROGRAM. THERE SHOULD BE ORDER INCORPORATE AND SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES OR THE ACTIVITIES REQUIRE THE COUNTIES ARE DOING WHEN TRANSITION A YOUTH FROM THE EXTENDED FOSTER CARE OUT OF IT'S- WITH REGARDS TO QUESTION THREE. AS THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERED SEPARATE DIRECT SUPPORT FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES AND SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES INCLUDE THE E. AS WAS MENTIONED THAT'S INCLUDED I BELIEVE IT WAS ON PAGE SEVENTY ONE THE CAREER ON MEDITATION FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES. I AM AS WELL AS A BUDGET YEAR THE PROPOSAL OF ABOUT THREE POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT- THOSE RESOURCE FAMILIES AND ESTHER TEEPEES WITH SOME OF THE IMMEDIATE PANDEMIC RELATED NEEDS SO. IS THE MINISTRATION IS CONSIDERED AN. INS INCLUDED SOME RESOURCES TO THAT. LASTLY THE QUESTION RELATED TO- THE ADMINISTRATION NOT EXTENDED PRE APPROVAL FUNDING FOR THE EMERGENCY CARE GIVERS- OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS LEGISLATURE INVESTORS TO WORK CLOSELY ON IDENTIFYING WHAT THE APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME IS FOR THE EMERGENCY CARE GIVER- PROGRAM AND TYPICALLY WE HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AS WE ARE NOW DURING THE MAKING PROCESS WHEN ADDITIONAL DATA. IS MORE AVAILABLE AFTER THE- THE PREVIOUS YEARS BUDGETS AND TO DETERMINE WHAT DATA IS LOOKING LIKE SO- THE TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ADDITIONAL CHANGE IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR FUNDING ON THIS IT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE MAIN REVISION. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CWD AT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRTH CATHERINE MCCONNELL WITH THE WTA. I THINK ESPECIALLY AS YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS FOR THE NINE PANELISTS IT WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THERE'S A LOT GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN CHILD WELFARE WORKER APPLING A SYSTEMIC RACISM CLASSISM AND INEQUITIES UNDERLIE OUR SOCIAL STRUCTURES AND ALSO INFLUENCED MUCH OF OUR SYSTEMS AND STORICA PRECIOUS CHILD AND FAMILY WELL BEING. WE'RE WORKING HARD TO DEVELOP MORE SERVICES FOR FAMILIES AND CAREGIVERS ESPECIALLY FOR OUR HEIGHTS NEEDS CHILDREN AND YOUTH. I'M TRYING TO WORK WITH COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HISTORICALLY OVERREPRESENTED AT REPRESENTED AT EVERY STAGE OF CHILD WELFARE. TO REDUCE THOSE DISPARITIES AND PROMOTE EQUITY IN OUR SYSTEM. AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO IMPLEMENT THE STATE'S GROUNDBREAKING CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM. AT THE SAME TIME WILL SOON BE IMPLEMENTING NEW FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OPTIONS AS YOU HEARD TODAY AND THE FAMILIES FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT FF PSA. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE ALTERNATIVE QUESTIONS POSED IN THE ABSENT AT FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE OUR SUPPORT FOR THE L. A. A RECOMMENDATION TO EXPAND EMERGENCY PLACEMENT FUNDING. FOR RELATIVE CAREGIVERS HER WHO'S APPROVALS ARE PENDING. AS WELL AS THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO CREATE THE WORKING GROUP TO CONTINUE LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS AND MAKE CONTINUED RECOMMENDATIONS. AS THE BUDGET PROCESS GOES ON. FIRST REGARDING STRENGTHENING THE PREVENTION COMPONENT OF THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO IMPLEMENT FAMILIES FIRST. AS YOU KNOW% PREVENTION IS CRITICAL TO STOPPING ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND DONE CORRECTLY IT CAN REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF PLACEMENT IN A FOSTER CARE. THE SERVICE IS AVAILABLE UNDER THE FF PSA PREVENTION COMPONENT ARE WELCOME BUT ARE ALSO NARROW THEY'RE LIMITED TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND IN HOME PARENTING SKILLS PROGRAM AND WILL NOT ADDRESS ALL ISSUE THE FAMILY MAY BE FACING. THE RULES TO ACCESS THESE FUNDS AS MR ROVE NOTED ARE ALSO VERY COMPLEX AND THEY'RE EASY TO RUN A FOLLOW. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PREVENTION PROPOSAL FRANKLY MISS IS THE OPPORTUNITY THE FAMILIES FIRST PROVIDES TO RETHINK OUR APPROACH TO SERVING FAMILIES. ESPECIALLY FAMILIES OF COLOR BEFORE THEY GET TO A POINT OF BEING BROUGHT INTO FORMAL FOSTER CARE. THE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE COUNTIES TO OFTEN FIND ALL NON FEDERAL COSTS AND THEN SHOULDER ALL THE RISK FOR ANY FINANCIAL LIABILITY. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS NEITHER BROUGHT ENOUGH OR BOLD ENOUGH AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM WITH ZERO STATE FUNDING AND ALL THE REST LATER THE COUNTY DOOR DOES NOT PROMOTE EQUITY IN OUR SYSTEM. IN CONTRAST TO THE PREVIOUS BUDGET PROPOSAL RESPONSE OF CHILDREN NOW YOU THE FAMILIES FIRST AS A SPRINGBOARD TO A BROADER STATEWIDE PREVENTION SYSTEM. THAT BUILDS AND DRAWS UPON COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. WE CALL FOR GENERAL FUND INVESTS IN A PREVENTION CONTINUUM ONE THAT ENGAGES PERSONS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH CHILD WELFARE AS WELL AS OTHER COMMUNITY LEADERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. TO BOTH DEVELOP AND EXPAND AVAILABLE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. THIS INCLUDES TANGIBLE SUPPORT SUCH AS CASH ASSISTANCE AND HOUSING AS WELL AS SERVICES THAT ARE GROUNDED AND RELEVANT TO THE COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES WE WORK WITH. SO ARE PROPOSAL WOULD INVEST FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING FOR ALL COUNTIES TO ENGAGE IN ROBUST INCLUSIVE LOCAL PLANNING AND INVESTMENT. AIMED AT REDUCING PLACEMENT IN A FOSTER CARE REDUCING THE DISPROPORTION AUDI THAT WE KNOW EXISTS IN OUR SYSTEM AT INCREASING EQUITY. THIS PROPOSAL IS SUPPORTED BY A GROWING COALITION OF MORE THAN FIFTY CHILD AND FAMILY SERVING ORGANIZATIONS SO FAR. THE PROPOSAL AND THEY COULD BE YOURS FOR A BROAD ARRAY OF SERVICES. THIS INCLUDES SERVICES THAT ARE MATT BOWL WITH TITLE FOR A YEAR UNDER THE CURRENT AFFECT PFA WALLS AS WELL AS THOSE THAT ARE NOT. THE FELLOW EVIDENCE BASED IN HOME PARENTING SKILL BUILDING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP. AND HOME BUILDERS WHICH ARE BOTH ELIGIBLE 450% FEDERAL FUNDING UNDER AFTER OF PSA RULES TODAY. ALSO BE INVESTED IN ALONG SIDE OTHER CULTURALLY REBEL RELEVANT PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE EFFECT OF BLACK PARENTING PROGRAMS AND ABRIENDO PUERTAS OR OPEN DOORS. THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FUNDING RIGHT NOW SO THEY COULD BE IN THE FUTURE IF WE'RE ABLE TO ALSO SUPPORT THE EVALUATION OF THEIR SUCCESSFUL HELP. EACH OTHER COMMUNITY AND FAMILY SPECIFIC SERVICES AND SUPPORT. WOULD BE IDENTIFIED AND IMPLEMENTED OR EXPANDED. TO THAT INCLUDES OF LOCAL PET PLANNING PROCESS. WHAT HAS BEEN THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL AND WASN'T ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT AT THE NEXT LAST. THE PURPOSE OF RFA IS TO UNIFY ALL LICENSING AND RELATIVE APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS ADOPTION APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS INTO A SINGLE STREAMLINED PROCESS WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING FAMILIES TO PREPARE THEM FOR THEIR IMPORTANT ROLE AS RESOURCE. OURTHANKS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED COUNTY MARK WHAT WHAT IT WAS MANDATED STATEWIDE BY THE C. C. R. LEGISLATION EIGHTY FOUR THREE PASSED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. TO BE CLEAR THE RFA PROCESS WAS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT AND GREETING YEAH AGREEMENTS. WHILE THE BILL WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THAT SOUGHT TO TEST THE IDEA OF MERGING TOGETHER THE PROCESS OF LICENSING FOSTER PARENTS AND APPROVING THEM AS ADOPTIVE PARENTS. THAT WILL ONLY AUTHORIZED UP TO FIVE PILOTS AND HAD NO STATEWIDE MANDATE. WE ARE REQUESTING EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE ADDED TO THE CHILD WELFARE PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET YEAR. TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL INCREASE COSTA COUNTY OF RK PROCESSING REQUIRED STATEWIDE FOR EIGHTY FOUR OH THREE AS WELL AS RELATED GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE TO COUNTY SINCE BEEN ISSUED SINCE THAT TIME. AND THE ABSENCE OF THE FUNDING BEING PROVIDED THE COUNTIES WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE SUFFERING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDS TO THE ARCADE PROCESS. FUNDS WHAT OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE NEEDED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS DIRECTLY TO OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. FINALLY RELATED TO TRAINING AND HOW TRAINING CAN IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF MORE ADEQUATE SERVICES AS WELL AS TRYING TO OVERCOME AND ADDRESS RACIAL BIAS. FROM MATT AND IMPLICIT BIAS. TO ADDRESS RACIAL BIAS AND TOM WITH OUR SYSTEM CDBG A HAS CONVENE OUR CHILD WELFARE LEADERSHIP IN A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS CHARAKTER PROMOTE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION. THIS WORK IS GROUNDED IN THE STATE REQUIRED INTEGRATED CORE PRACTICE MODEL WHICH EMPHASIZES CHILD AND FAMILY VOICE IN CHOICE AT THE CENTER OF SERVICE PLANNING TO THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEENAGE PROSPECTS. MISTER WOULD TELL WALKER TRAINING SYSTEM PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN BUILDING DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION AND CHILD WELFARE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE TRAINING SYSTEM WAS PURPOSEFULLY NOT INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. MEANING THE STATE RETAINED BY FORTY OVER THE FACT THAT I DECISION INTENDED TO PROMOTE CONSISTENCY STATEWIDE. THE COMPLEX WORK OF CHILD WELFARE CARD REQUIRES A HIGHLY TRAINED AND SKILLED WORKFORCE TO MEET EVER CHANGING MANDATES AND HIGH EXPECTATIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY THE TRAINING SYSTEM HAS FALLEN BEHIND IN GIVING COUNTY STAFF THE TOOLS TO STRENGTHEN YOUR FAMILY STORYLINES OF EQUITY AND ANTI RACIST. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP CWPA THE NATIONAL SOCIAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AND FTI YOU CALIFORNIA JOINTLY REQUEST AN AUGMENTATION OF SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR TRAINING SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE FIVE MILLION INCREASE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE DO NOT TAKE ISSUE WITH A COMPONENT OF THAT PROPOSAL BUT BELIEVE THAT MORE IMPROVEMENTS UNLESS MORE INVESTMENT IS NEEDED. OUR AUTHENTICATION WITHOUT APPROACH OF THE TRAINING THAT WE TO REAL PRACTICE CHANGED AS WELL AS ADVANCED TRAINING IN TARGETED AREAS SUCH AS WORKING WITH FAMILIES TO ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM AND INEQUITY. AND EMPOWERING SOCIAL WORKERS TO RECOGNIZE AND OVERCOME THEIR OWN IMPLICIT BIAS FEES AS WELL AS RESPOND TO THE BIASING OF OTHERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I LOOK FOR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KRISTEN POWER VICE PRESIDENT WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY ON HOW WE CAN BETTER SUPPORT TRANSITION AGE YOUTH THROUGH BEYOND THE PANDEMIC I'M CHRISTIAN POWER WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS. IN RECOGNITION OF THE CHALLENGES RELATED TO CODING NINETEEN LEGISLATURE TOOK STEPS LAST YEAR TO ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING NON MINOR DEPENDENTS. WHO CANNOT MEET EXTENDED FOSTER CARE PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS AND TO CONTINUE SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO TURNED TWENTY ONE THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FEDERAL LAW HAS SINCE EXTENDED THAT TIMELINE TO SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD EXTEND THAT TIMELINE TO THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. YET THE SAFETY NET DOES NOT EXTEND TO THOSE YOU COME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AS THEY APPROACH THEIR EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY. WE'RE SEEKING A MODEST BUDGET INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO ENSURE YOU WHO ARE IN NEED OF SERVICES. BUT WERE UNABLE TO ENTER FOSTER CARE DUE TO COURT HEARING OR CHILD WELFARE INVESTIGATION DELAYS ARE ABLE TO DO SO DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE DEPENDENCY COURT ADJUDICATION PROCESS INVOLVES MULTIPLE HEARINGS OVERPRESCRIBED CREATES A TIME WHICH LEAVES OLDER MINORS VULNERABLE TO TIMING OUT OF THE PROCESS IF THEY TURN EIGHTEEN WHILE WAITING FOR THEIR JURISDICTIONAL HEARING. THIS PROPOSAL CALLED THE OLDER YOU ENTRY INTO FOSTER CARE AND CHAMPION BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON. OFFERS AN EXCEPTION FOR THOSE OLDER MINORS SO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE EXTENDED FOSTER CARE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR HOME THE COURT FINDS IT IN THEIR BEST INTEREST TO ENTER EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. PROVISIONS ARE INTENTIONALLY NARROW TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OLDER MINORS IMPACTED BY PANDEMIC RELATED DELAYS. AND THERE IS A SUNSET ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. PROVIDING A MUCH NEEDED LIFELINE DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHEN AN IDENTIFIABLE LIFE ALTERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED LIFE LIKE OF USE OR NEGLECT. CAN CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF A YOUNG LIFE. STEMMING IN OPEN PIPELINE TO CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS RELEASED YOU WILL ALLOW THEM TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE AS THEY TRANSITION FROM CRISIS. AND TO OUR NORMAL. IN ADDITION HOUSING INSTABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS SIGNIFICANTLY HINDER THE PURSUIT OF HIGHER EDUCATION MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT SELF SUFFICIENCY FOR YOU WE'RE CURRENTLY OR FORMERLY IN FOSTER CARE YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND USED UNDER PROBATION SUPERVISION AS THEY TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD. AND THEN I WILL HAVE DEVASTATING ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR MANY AND PARTICULARLY FOR YOU. FOLLOWING THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD WAS MORE THAN 18% OR TWICE THE OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR BLACK AND BROWN YOUTH IT ROSE TO THIRTY AND 20% RESPECTIVELY. AND HOMELESSNESS AMONG SOME GROUPS OF YOU IS DISPROPORTIONATE UP 240% OF HOMELESS YOUTH IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ. A PRIMARY PURPOSE TO THE EXTENT OF FOSTER HERE TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AS YOU ENTER EARLY ADULTHOOD. HOWEVER WITHOUT SUFFICIENT SUPPORTED HOUSING THAT VISION AND EXTENT OF KOSTER HERE'S FALLING FLAT. FURTHER FAILURE TO SUPPORT YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS RESULTING IN INCREASED CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AND DISCONNECTION AS ADULTS. THE CREATION OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FORGIVABLE LOAN PROGRAM TO CREATE NEW HOUSING FOR YOU CENTER TWENTY SIX WE'RE CURRENTLY OR FORMERLY IN FOSTER YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND YOU UNDER PROBATION SUPERVISION SUPERVISION. IS TANGIBLE SUPPORT FOR ARIAN PEOPLE. THIS LOAN PROGRAM CALLED THE SUPPORT ACT. SUPPORTING UNDERSERVED YOUNG PEOPLE FOR POSITIVE RESET AND TRANSITIONS. IS CHAMPIONED BY SENATOR WIENER. LOANS CAN BE USED FOR PRE DEVELOPMENT SIDE ACQUISITION ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN COSTS AND CONSTRUCTION OR REFURBISHING OF SITES. APPORTION THE FUNDS ARE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE AGES TWENTY. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE. THIS PROPOSAL KICKSTARTS THE HOUSING ACQUISITION WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PROCESS FOR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH INTEREST FREE FORGIVABLE LOANS TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SHELTER AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. REMOVING FINANCIAL BARRIERS FOR SHOVEL READY PROJECTS WILL ADDRESS BOTH THE PRE EXISTING HOUSING CRISIS AND PERSISTENT HOUSING NEEDS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC FOR POLITICAL TRANSITION EIGHT YEARS. BY REDUCING CONSTRUCTION FINANCING TIMELINES TO MORE QUICKLY DEVELOP NEW SPECIALIZED HOUSING INVENTORY. I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE PANDEMIC CARE COVER STATEMENT AND EMERGENCY TRACK YOUR BRIDGE PROGRAM EXPANSION WHICH MY CALLING THIS METHOD WILL DETAIL AND URSEL LEGISLATURE TO CREATE A FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES BACK WORKING GROUP. TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY INTO THE TRAILER BILL DEVELOPMENT AS NOTED IN THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. WE'RE WORKING WITH PARTNERS PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS THE TRAILER BILL AND KNOW MUCH MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE. FOR EXAMPLE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR TRAVEL YOU. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY PARTICIPATE AND SHOW MORE HOW WE CAN BETTER SUPPORT TRANSITION AGE YOUTH THROUGH AND BEYOND THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SUZANNE ON IF AN DIRECTOR OF CHILDREN NOW. MISS NIVEN. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SONORA NELSON DIRECTOR OF CHILD WELFARE POLICY AND CHILDREN NOW THAT'S PRAYER SPEAKERS AND NOTED COMING HIS ABANDONED OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM COURT SHOWDOWN IN THE INITIAL DAYS WE'RE SLOWLY TRANSITION VIRTUALLY AND SOME CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE. BACKLOGS AND DELAYS IN THE AREA. DISTANCE LEARNING SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN TO NAVIGATE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND REMAINING GAUGE AND LEARNING DESPITE DISRUPTING ACADEMIC SUPPORT. COMINFORM SERVICES IN SOME PARTS MANAGER REMOTE DELIVERY OR SOPPED ALTOGETHER DESTRUCTIONS TO ROUTINES AND VISITATION WITH FAMILY HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE. OUR CAMERAS ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE CHILDREN WHILE BALANCING INCREASING RESPONSIBILITIES AND COPING WITH SEVERELY LIMITED ACCESS TO CORPORATE CRITICAL SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. MANY CARE GIVERS ARE OLDER HAD HIGH RISK OF BECOMING BUT CONTINUE TO OPEN THEIR HOMES TO CHILDREN AND INTERACT WITH A VARIETY OF FAMILIES PROVIDERS IN CASE WORKERS. SOME OF LOST INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT AS A STRUGGLE TO MEET INCREASING NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN RWANDA GEN SCHOOL OR OTHER PROGRAMS OUTSIDE THE HOME. SOCIAL WORKERS. INTERACTIONS WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS AND SHE ONLY VISITATION REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TIME PLANNING AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS. SOME WATER HAS BEEN PROVIDING FOR THOSE WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH CAROLINE AND FOR USING THE EXTENDED FOSTER CARE PROGRAM POLICIES THAT WERE VITALLY NEEDED AND ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED. HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN ABUSED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND THEIR CAREGIVERS AND LARGELY OVERLOOKED. IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. WE ARE SO REGISTRATION AND ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE TEMPORARY AND DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL. OSTRACH HERE TO PROMOTE STABILITY AND NEED TO HAVE DONE. FIRST WE RECOMMEND EXCITING'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH PER CHILD FOR CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED TO CHILDREN LIVING IN FAMILY HOMES THIS WILL COST AN ESTIMATED FORTY NINE POINT TWO MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING. IN ADDITION WE RECOMMEND EDUCATIONAL STIPENDS OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR ALL K. TWELVE STUDENTS IN FOSTER CARE TO ACCOUNT FOR ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT AND OTHER REMOTE LEARNING REQUIREMENTS THIS IMPOSSIBLE ESTIMATED TWENTY FOUR MILLION. IN ONE TIME FUNDING. CHILDREN NOW URGES. THE EMERGENCY BRIDGE PROGRAM AS WE ARE BY GREG WELLS- I JUST REALLY NEED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CHILDCARE WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE TO INCREASE FUNDING BY THIRTY SEVEN MILLION I'M GOING. TATIAN THE BRIDGE PROGRAM HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE SUCCESS ALLOWING CHILDREN TO BE PLACED IN HOMES THAT BEST MEET THEIR NEEDS INCLUDING WITH RELATIVES AND CAREGIVERS WHO ARE KNOWN TO THEM. AND IT ALSO SUPPORTS PARENTING USE IN FOSTER. CARE AS THEY WORK OR ATTEND SCHOOL. ALMOST TO SHOW TWENTY BILLION JANE TEMPERATURES AND GLOBAL FOR THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM. JUST LAST WEEK I RECEIVED A CALL FROM MY COUNTY IS ALLOCATION FOR PROJECT FUNDING WAS EXHAUSTED HALFWAY THROUGH THE YEAR. THE REQUESTED MORE FUNDS. THE PROPOSAL SEATS AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CHILD CARE NAVIGATORS WHO WORK WITH CARE GIVERS TO FIND IN SECURING LONG TERM CHILD CARE. AND EXTENDS TO SIX TO TWELVE MONTH TIMELINE DUTY INCREASED AVAILABILITY. OF CHILDCARE DURING THE PANDEMIC. FINALLY THE PROPOSAL'S AN ADDITIONAL FOUR MILLION. DURING TRUMP TRAINING AVAILABLE FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THIS TRAINING NOT ONLY SUPPORTS CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. ALL CHILDREN WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO PROCESS THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC. IN CLOSING I WOULD KNOW TO FOLLOWING CHILDREN NOW IS KIND OF SPONSORING THE FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES AFTER POUNDS ALL PRESENTED BY CEDAR BDA AND WE SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS TO FORM A WORKING GROUP. TO ALLOW TIME FOR STATE. I TO FIND IT YES A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. WE ALSO. REMOVING THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE ATTACHED TO FIND CRITICAL CHAO WILL FOR PROGRAMS. AND THAT INCLUDING FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM WHICH IS NOTED EARLIER I WHICH PROVIDES USE AND THEIR CAREGIVERS AND TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TRAUMA INFORMED SUPPORT NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER. LASTLY I REMAIN DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ROLL OUT THE FLAWED LEVEL OF CARE PROTOCOL THIS TO. MY CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS I WE ASK THE STATE WORK QUICKLY. AND COLLABORATIVELY. CALIBRATES IS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY CALIFORNIA HAS ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. EACH PRIORITIZE THEM IN THE STATE BUDGET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CHRISTINE STONER MERTZ WHO CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHEER ARAMBULA I DO HAVE A PRESENTATION THAT I AM. LOOKING TO PULL UP SERVE JUST ONE MOMENT IF I COULD. WE SEE THE GREAT VERY GOOD. THANK YOU SO MUCH ABOUT YOUR ARAMBULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND CHRISTINE STONER MERTZ. THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES REPRESENTING A HUNDRED FIFTY NATIONALLY ACCREDITED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES INTO A WELFARE ADOPTIONS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EDUCATION JUVENILE JUSTICE. SYSTEMS AS WELL AS PROVIDING PREVENTION SERVICES WE SEE FIRSTHAND THE CHALLENGES OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM THROUGH THE EYES OF OUR MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS THE VISION OF C. C. R. WHICH HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON CHILDREN FAMILIES REMAINING TOGETHER WHENEVER POSSIBLE AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF FOSTER YOUTH IN RESIDENTIAL CARE. DOES NOT MATCH THE REALITIES THAT THOSE PROVIDING SERVICES ARE EXPERIENCING. RACIAL DISPARITIES AS MANY OF SAID CONTINUE TO EXIST IN THE FOSTER AND PROBATION SYSTEMS AND WE NEED TO IDENTIFY CONCRETE STEPS TO RECTIFY THIS THROUGHOUT THE CONTINUUM. IMPLICIT BIAS AND INSTITUTIONAL RACISM MUST BE ADDRESSED AT EVERY DECISION POINT IN A CHILD'S LIFE IN ORDER TO HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO ADDRESSING THESE DISPARITIES. THEN MY SLIDE ONE OUTLOOK MAPS. APOLOGIES I'M NOT SURE WHY YEAH. WELL- GAPS THAT WE SEE IN THE IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE THAT ARE IMPACTING. A CHILDREN OF COLOR. INCLUDE LIMITED RESOURCES AND EFFORTS TOWARDS FAMILY FINDING AN ENGAGEMENT THE IMPACT PERMANENCY FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH WHILE A STATED PRIORITY WHAT IS EXPERIENCED BY PROVIDERS YOUTH AND FAMILIES DOES NOT ALWAYS REFLECT THIS THERE IS WIDE VARIATION REGARDING WHAT CONSTITUTES THE MINIMUM THAT SHOULD BE DONE. SECONDLY A LACK OF RESOURCE FAMILIES PARTICULARLY FOR OLDER YOUTH L. G. B. T. Q. AND TRANS GENDER YOUTH AND YOUTH WAS SPECIALIZED CARE NEEDS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR MORE INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE FAMILIES AND WORK TO DEVELOP THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE. THIRDLY THE TO THE STABILITY OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES THE HIGH TURNOVER THE FFA'S EXPERIENCE IN SOCIAL WORKERS IMPACTS THE CHILD IN FOSTER FAMILY WHO COUNT ON THE SOCIAL WORKERS TO BE AVAILABLE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AND SUPPORT THEM THROUGH MANY UPS AND DOWNS. ADEQUATE SUPPORT BOTH FINANCIAL AND SYSTEMIC SUPPORTS FOR STR T. P.'S. AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE CONTINUUM OF THESE ARE THE MOST INTENSIVE SERVICES AVAILABLE APART FROM CRISIS SERVICES AND HOSPITALIZATION YET THE LACK OF SUPPORT ACROSS THE SYSTEM TO ENSURE. THAT THEY REMAIN VIABLE HAS RESULTED IN SOME OF OUR MOST EXPERIENCED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS CLOSING. THE NEED FOR CRISIS SERVICES. CHILDREN'S CRESSIDA RESIDENTIAL CRISIS PROGRAMS CRISIS STABILIZATION AND MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS THAT CAN ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS TO STABILIZE. THOSE SITUATIONS AND FINALLY WE NEED TO INTERROGATE OUR SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT OUR PUBLIC SERVING CHILD AND FAMILY SYSTEMS ARE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE. THERE'VE BEEN SO MANY IMPACTS YOU'VE HEARD FOR MANY ABOUT THESE- OF CODE ON OUR PROVIDER. COMMUNITY SERVICES STAFF AND OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED PROVIDERS MOVE TO A VIRTUAL SERVICES WHENEVER POSSIBLE TO LIMIT EXPOSURE FOR BOTH STAFF YOUTH AND FAMILIES BUT MANY EMPLOYEES PARTICULARLY THOSE AND FFA'S AND S. T. R. T. P. ISN'T CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY IN PERSON SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET CHILDREN'S NEEDS DISTANCE LEARNING HAS MEANT ADDED COSTS FIRST YEAR TEEPEES AS ADDITIONAL STAFF HAVE BEEN REQUIRED DURING SCHOOL HOURS TO SUPPORT YOUTH DIRECT SERVICE STAFF WORKING IN BOTH FFA'S AND ASKED YOUR GP'S ARE AT RISK AND ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO ARE ALSO OFTEN FROM THE COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. OPERATIONALLY THE SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERIENCED COLD OUTBREAKS AND HAVE HAD TO REDUCE CAPACITY DUE TO PUBLIC HEALTH CLOSURES. IN ORDER TO IN ORDER TO INCREASE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE HOME BASED CARE INCREASE PERMANENCY AND STABLE I SERVICES FOR THE MOST AT RISK FOSTER YOUTH WE MUST ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE STABILITY THE BEST YEAR TWO PEAS AND FFA'S. AND DEVELOP A PROCESS FOR CLOSING ALL GAPS IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. AS WE IMPLEMENT THE FAMILY FIRST SERVICES ACT WE MUST BE INTENTIONAL IN OUR APPROACH TO SYSTEM AND CULTURE CHANGE. WE SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION OUTLINED ON PAGE SEVENTY SIX TO DEVELOP A WORK GROUP TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX AND INTERRELATED QUESTIONS RAISED IN THE CURRENT TBL. THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE HAS TO BUDGET REQUESTS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE STABILITY OF FFA'S. WE ALSO HAVE DEVELOPED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A PATH FORWARD TO CLOSE AN ADDITIONAL GAPS IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. THIS PICTURE REFLECTS THE IN IMPACT ON CHILDREN'S PERMANENCY WHEN THEY HAVE MORE THAN ONE SOCIAL WORKER. FFA SOCIAL WORKERS MUST HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE BE AVAILABLE 24788% OF THEM ARE FEMALE AND MANY OF THEM ARE FROM A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. COMMITTED TO GIVING BACK. TURNOVER IS THAT MILLION DOLLAR STATE GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION REQUEST. WHICH IS COSPONSORED BY NSW WILL HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HIGH FOSTER FAMILIES SOCIAL WORKER TURNOVER. FFA'S PROVIDE HOMES FOR ALMOST ONE THIRD OF ALL FOSTER CHILDREN IN HOME BASED CARE AND 1100% OF ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE THIS REQUEST INCREASES THE SOCIAL WORK COMPONENT OF THE RATE BY FIFTY DOLLARS PER CHILD PER MONTH AND THIS WILL GO DIRECTLY TO SOCIAL WORKERS WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO FOR BEING OUR CHAMPION IN THIS MULTI YEAR EFFORT. TO SUPPORT FFA SOCIAL WORKERS. AND FINALLY OUR ONE TIME URGENT COVERT NINETEEN REIMBURSEMENT REQUESTS FOR EST HERE TO PIECE OF FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR STATE GENERAL FUND WILL HELP ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE RISK OF MORE PROGRAMS CLOSING. HELP TO STABILIZE STAFFING AND ADDRESS THE CURRENT EMERGENCY NEEDS OF THESE NONPROFIT PROVIDERS CARING FOR THE HIGHEST NEEDS YOU. AND WHO HAVE TAKEN FIFTY FOUR OF THE OUT OF STATE USE THAT HAVE RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA. THE COST PER ADDITIONAL STAFFING QUARANTINING YOUTH AND STAFF INCREASED HOURLY RATE SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT AND SIGNIFICANT REVENUE LOSSES RELATED TO PUBLIC HEALTH CLOSURES OF FACILITIES AND BILLABLE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE AT WORST DO TO REDUCE CAPACITY ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS TO BE AT SERIOUS RISK. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS FOR CHAMPIONING CHAMPING THIS REQUEST WHICH REFLECTS HIS COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE. OUR DEEPEST GRATITUDE TO YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OUR FINAL PANELIST FOR ISSUE FOR JORDAN SOSOK STATEWIDE LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY MANAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION. PLEASE BEGIN. AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SPEAK AND TODAY'S PANEL MY NAME IS JORDAN SOSA AND I'M A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION. AS THE STATEWIDE LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY MANAGER. FOR OVER THREE DECADES C. Y. C. HAS BEEN A PLACE FOR CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH FROM ACROSS THE STATE TO COME TOGETHER TO TRANSFORM CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. YOUR LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND PRACTICE CHANGE ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM INTENDS TO REMOVE CHILDREN AND YOUTH FROM THEIR PARENTS CUSTODY ONLY WHEN NECESSARY FOR THEIR WELL BEING OR THE PUBLIC SAFETY C. Y. C. MEMBERS DON'T FIND THIS TO BE THE CASE. WHAT IS THE CASE IS THAT THERE IS A CULTURE OF PUTTING POLICIES OVER A UNITS WHITE. AS A YOUTH LED ORGANIZATION C. Y. C. ADVOCATES FOR A SYSTEM THAT WILL HONOR AND NOURISH EVERY INDIVIDUAL IMPACTED BY FOSTER CARE AND HOLD ASSISTANCE ACCOUNTABLE WHEN IT'S NOT SUPPORTING THE STABILITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE. WHILE CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITY OF ORIGIN WE ARE FORCED TO INHERIT A SYSTEM WHERE BLACK AND BROWN YOUTH ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE PLACED IN A CONGREGATE CARE SETTING WHEN THEY FACE ADDITIONAL TRAUMA. OR THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM WHEN EXPERIENCING MULTIPLE FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT CHANGES. THREE THE AGE OF KOBE NINETEEN THE C. WEISS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN ADVOCATING DIRECT CASH AID FOR CURRENT FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. ADDRESSING THE INTERSECTION MALADY OF THE WAR ON DRUGS WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. ENGAGING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE VIRTUALLY SHARING GO FUND ME PAGES FROM FUNERAL EXPENSES OR FOR LEGAL FEES DUE TO BEING ARRESTED AND SUPPORT FOR BLACK LIBERATION. AND CONNECTING WITH AVAILABLE RESOURCES LIKE FY I HOUSING VOUCHERS THANK TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT WITH AYE FOSTER .ORG AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE SEE RACIAL INEQUITIES. THAT WE ARE THEY USE ARE BEING LABELED BASED ON CASE NOTES AND NOT FROM EXPERIENCES. IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY I PERSONALLY ATTENDED A CHILDREN FAMILY TEAM MEETING FOR A C. Y. C. MEMBER ADVOCATE AND SUPPORT WHEN THEY WERE ISSUED A FOURTEEN DAY NOTICE. A FOURTEEN DAY NOTICES WHEN A FOSTER CARE AGENCY. THE COUNTY THE YOUTH THE FAMILY ARE NOTIFIED WHEN THE YOUNG PERSON HAS TO MOVE TO A NEW FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT. BUT IT'S MORE THAN JUST THE POLICY. IT'S FOURTEEN DAYS TO SAY THEIR GOODBYES TO THEIR FRIENDS. THEIR FAMILIES BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW HOW FAR THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM CAN REFUSE RELATIONSHIPS OR CONNECTIONS. FOURTEEN DAYS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT LIFE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. WHAT SCHOOL TO ATTEND OR WHO ARE GOING TO BE THE NEW- PUBLIC SERVICE PROFESSIONALS. TO BILL A NEW REPORT WITH. THERE'S ALSO A FEAR OF BEING PLACED IN AN EMERGENCY. SHELTER DURING THE PANDEMIC. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT CURRENTLY COLLECT. DATA ON PLACEMENT CHANGES IN A WAY THAT FACILITATES A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING ON WHO. WHAT WHERE WHEN AND WHY THEY ARE HAPPENING. WE HAVE SUSPICION BASED ON ANECDOTES AND SEE WHY THESE MEMBERS PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. THE DIESEL BROUGHT PLACEMENT CHANGES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ. YOUTH WITH MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS YES WITH A DISABILITY AND YOUTH OF COLOR. I DO I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION REGARDING SERVING YOU THROUGH AN EQUITY LANCE AND TOPPING AT STATE WHITE LITTLE LEADERSHIP PLATFORM AND IMPLEMENTED WITH A FULLY RESOURCE COUNTY PARTNERSHIP. ADOPTING A STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP PLATFORM WILL BE THE FIRST STEP IN CARING USE WITHIN EQUITY LETS. YOUNG PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ARE STRUGGLING THROUGH I'M PRESIDENTE CRISIS AND NEED HELP MORE THAN EVER ISSUES AFFECTING YOUTH HAVE BECOME MORE PRESSING SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH. ECONOMIC ECONOMIC INSTABILITY AND RACIAL INJUSTICE AND YOUNG PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES FRUSTRATED WITH THE LACK OF PARTICIPATION IN SHAPING THEIR FUTURES. THAT'S WHY C. WAITING MEMBERS ARE COSPONSORING ASSEMBLY BILL FORTY SIX AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LUIS RIVAS WHICH WILL ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE ADVISORY BODY TO THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT COMPRISED SOLELY OF YOU. OVER TWENTY OTHER STATES IN THE US HAVE A STATEWIDE YOUTH ADVISORY COUNCIL WRITTEN INTO STATE STATUTE. ASIANS MISSION THE POWER UNDER REPRESENTED YOUTH WITH FORMAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN CALIFORNIA CIVIC PROCESS. IN REGARDS TO IMPLEMENT A FULLY RESOURCE COUNTY PARTNERSHIP I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME SEE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FROM C. Y. C. MEMBERS FOR COUNTIES TO ENGAGE AUTHENTICALLY WITH YOUNG PEOPLE ONE NO A WALLS. ALSO USES A FOSTER CARE SHOULD STOP ASSOCIATING PROTEST WITH CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR CRIMINALIZATION STIGMATIZES ADVOCACY. TO ALLOW ACT ACCESS TO ADVOCACY PLATFORMS ALLOW YOU TO EXPRESS THEIR PROTEST EVEN IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE PERCENT SIGN PETITIONS ATTEND VIRTUAL TOWN HALLS IN CONFERENCES LIKE RIGHT NOW I CALL OFFICIALS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TO NOT USE ADVOCACY AS A TOOL TO DISCIPLINE YOUNG PEOPLE AND CARE. THREE PROVIDE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES IF YOU START ATTENDING IN PERSON DEMONSTRATIONS BE SUPPORTIVE PROVIDE FACEMASK SNACKS WATER A LIST OF THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR PROTESTS AND DISCUSS SOCIAL DISTANCING BEST PRACTICES WE RECOGNIZE THE MANY YOU DON'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO STAY AT HOME TO PARTICIPATE AND BLACK LIBERATION AND ADVOCACY. AND FOR THE BALLOT CURRICULUM AND TRAINING ADDRESSING RACISM AND PRIVILEGES WE WANT INDIVIDUALS TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND STOP ABOUT RACISM. THAT EXISTS WITHIN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. CHALLENGE AND INDIVIDUALS WHAT PRIVILEGES TO UNDERSTAND THE USE PERSPECTIVES AND HOW THEY SEE THEMSELVES AS PART OF THE CONVERSATION ON RACE. I WOULD LIKE TO CAN INCLUDE THAT CHILDREN AND YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PUT THEM INTO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. WE MAY BE BORN INTO POVERTY WE MAY BE BORN INTO A COUNTRY FILLED WITH STRIFE AND SYSTEMATIC RACISM WE MAY EVEN CONFRONT THE FEELINGS OF OUR OWN PARENTS. BEFORE FASCIAS THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL HURDLES TO OVERCOME FROM STIGMA THIS FORCED ASSIMILATION OF INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES THE WAR ON DRUGS THE LEGACY OF SLAVERY JIM CROW. FEDERAL STATE POLICIES DISCRIMINATING ASIAN COMMUNITIES THE PERSECUTION OF UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES THE FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY FACING THE PRISON INDUSTRY PRESENT INDUSTRY COMPLEX AND THE ONGOING PROBLEMS OF DISCRIMINATION. IT'S TIME FOR THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND LISTEN TO THE YOUTH ESPECIALLY YOUTH OF COLOR THE FACE RASH RACIAL AND ETHNIC BIAS I BELIEVE. WE EACH EXPERIENCE OUR OWN HARDSHIPS BUT WE DON'T LISTEN AND EMPOWER YOUNG PEOPLE AND FUTURE GENERATIONS THEN THE SYSTEM IS ACCEPTING THESE. IN EQUITIES TO BE PERMANENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU JORDAN AND- I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT ANY BETTER MYSELF AND- IF I COULD JUST ECHO YOUR COMMENTS I WOULD JUST SAY IT'S LONG PAST TIME FOR US TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION SO. WITH THAT I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS FOR ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AS A SPONSOR OF THE BUDGET REQUEST I AM ASKING FOR FIVE POINT FORM- MILLION. DOLLARS IN STATE GENERAL FUND TO INCREASE PERMANENCY OUTCOMES. FOR FOSTER CHILDREN AND YOUTH BY REDUCING FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY. SOCIAL WORKER TURNOVER. I IT IS MY HONOR TO CONTINUE FIGHTING FOR FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY SOCIAL WORKERS. THE DATA IS ALREADY AVAILABLE THAT REDUCING TURNOVER IMPROVES OVERALL HEALTH AND ACHIEVEMENT OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER YOUTH. THE RESILIENCY OF OUR FOSTER YOUTH IN THE FACE OF COVERT NINETEEN CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED. HOWEVER PROVIDING FOR THEM SHOULD NOT COME AT A FINANCIAL BURDEN TO THOSE WHO DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO KEEPING THEM SAFE. AS WE RE OPEN THE STATE. THE NUMBER OF CASES OF CHILD ABUSE IS EXPECTED TO RISE. WITH ACCESS TO COURT MANDATED REPORTERS AND WHEN THE NATURAL. SUPPORT OF SCHOOLS. MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS SPORTS COMMUNITY AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS ARE ARE AND EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES RETURNED. CALIFORNIA WILL NEED EXPERIENCE SOCIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES ON THE FRONT LINES TO BE PREPARED. THESE ARE THE CURRENTLY BEES OF FOLKS ARE CURRENTLY THE LOWEST PAID OF ALL CHILD SOCIAL WORKER PROFESSIONALS. THIS MODEST ASK WOULD REMEDY THE DELAND RATE CHANGES FOR FFA'S THAT THE STATE POSTPONED FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I'M ASKING THE BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND MY FELLOW BUDGET SUB ONE MEMBERS TO PRIORITIZE BRIGHT PRIORITIZE THE FOSTER CHILDREN AND YOUTH BY REALLY INVENT IT REINVESTING THE FFA SOCIAL WORKER TIME STUDY SAVING BACKED. UP INTO THE SOCIAL WORKERS WHO ARE CRITICAL TO THE WELL BEING AND PERMANENT NANCY EFFORTS TO CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER YOUTH AND CHILDREN. I DON'T I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK SPONSORS. AT THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER FOR THEIR WORK AND MEETING WITH ALL RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES AS WELL AS BUDGET STAFF IN THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY- THESE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE CRITICAL TO THE WORK THAT WE DO. I AND I KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND AGAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR WORK WITH OUR FOSTER KIDS. THE ONE ISSUE IF I MAY. THE OTHER ISSUE IS- SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND FROM GENERAL FUND. HEALTHY FUTURES FOR FOSTER YOUTH I AND I HAVE A BILL AB SIX. THREE SIXTY SIX- ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH AND THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW LAW I AM REQUESTING SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS. FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO ESTABLISH AN EARLY INFANT SUPPLEMENT FOR EXTENT THE EXPECTANT FOSTER YOUTH. THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE BIRTH OF THEIR CHILD. PRENATAL INCOME SUPPLEMENTS ARE SHOWN TO BE. NO MORTALITY STILL BIRTH. AND THE LENGTH OF HOSPITAL STAY FOLLOWING A COMPLICATED. LIFE BIRD. YOUNG PEOPLE AND FOSTER CARE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE CURRENT CAL WORKS PRENATAL INCOME BENEFIT. MANY OF THE YOUTH IN CARE IDENTIFY AS BLACK LATINO NATIVE AMERICAN ASIAN AMERICAN OR PACIFIC ISLANDER. ALMOST HALF OF FEMALE YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE IN CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE BEEN PREGNANT AT LEAST ONCE BY EIGHT BY EIGHT TO NINETEEN. AND THAT RATE IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE RATE OF YOUNG WOMEN WHO ARE NOT IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. PROVIDING THIS BENEFIT WILL PUT A DIRECT END TO PREVENTABLE DEATH AMONG PARENTING YOUTH AND ADDRESS EXISTING RACIAL AND GENDER INEQUITIES IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THIS IS AN UNFORTUNATE EXAMPLE OF HOW THE INEQUITIES DISCUSS TODAY. LEAD TO ENTER GENERATIONAL HEALTH DISPARITIES WITHOUT THIS BENEFIT CALIFORNIA IS SAYING THAT BEING A FOSTER YOUTH AND BEING A PARENT OUR- COMORBIDITIES. CALIFORNIA IS FAILING AS A PARENT. AND GRANDPARENT TO THESE YOUTH WE- ARE WE AS LEGISLATORS CAN DO MORE TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND BIRTH OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH IN CARE AND THEIR CHILDREN AND THEN THE SAME STEP EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS. I'M ASKING THE BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND MY FATHER BUDGET SUB ONE MEMBERS TO PRIORITIZE HEALTHY FUTURES FOR FOSTER YOUTH BY EXTENDING THE INFANT SUPPLEMENT. CALIFORNIA CAN DO MORE TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE AND THEIR CHILDREN AND SUPPORT THEM AS HEALTHY YOUNG FAMILIES. ADDITIONALLY CALIFORNIA ENCOURAGE HIGH MEDICAL COSTS RELATED TO MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY STILLBIRTH MISCARRIAGE AND COMPLICATED PREGNANCIES THIS MODEST EXPENDITURE WILL MORE THAN PAY FOR ITSELF AND FUTURE SAVINGS AS AN INVESTMENT TO PREVENTIVE CARE. THROUGH ENDORSING THESE ADVOCATES AND HAVING MET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE GOAL IS FOR THESE THESE MODEST ASKEDTO BE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE BUDGET. AGAIN DURING THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS THAT WE OFFER FOR OUR FIRST YEAR THEY MIGHT REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO INVEST NOW LOOK TO PREVENT- MORE. TO PREVENT- MORE DISPARITY IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO I WILL- NO MOVE TO ASK A QUESTION OF KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD IF I CAN I WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD EXPLAIN HOW THE RFA THAT RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS RELATES TO PROP THIRTY AND HOW THIS RESULTS IN YOUR CONTINUING REQUEST. THANK YOU MISTER SURE I'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT AT THE CENTER LANE WITH THE WPA. SO OPPOSITION THIRTY IN A NUTSHELL IS THAT ANY NEW REQUIREMENT ENACTED. POSTED TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. THAT PROPOSITION THIRTY WHICH IS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS OF CONSTITUTIONAL RELATES TO THAT HAS THE OVERALL EFFECT OF INCREASING COSTS AND REALIGN PROGRAM NEED ONLY BE IMPLEMENTED TO THE EXTENT IT IS FUNDED. AND SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT PROPOSITION THIRTY REQUIREMENTS WERE MET WITH THE CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR LEGISLATION THAT LEGISLATION INCLUDED A TRUE UP PROCESS. TO ENSURE THAT NEW COSTS THAT ARE COUNTY WOULDN'T HER ON THE MARGIN WE'RE GOING TO BE COVERED BY THE GENERAL FUND. AND SO- IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE ORIGINAL CONTINUING CARE BILL EIGHTY FOUR OH THREE IT CREATED REQUIREMENTS ALL OVER THE PLACE THAT WERE EXPANDED BUT THEY'RE OFTEN BUILT ON THE TYPES OF. ACTIVITIES ARE WORKERS ALREADY DEAD SO- IN MOST COUNTIES THAT FOR EXAMPLE WE DID ALREADY APPROVED RELATIVE CAREGIVERS AND DID SOME LICENSING OF NON RELATIVE FOSTER PARENTS AS WELL AND SO THE ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT ARE IF THEY REQUIRED WOULD BE THAT MARGINAL COST INCREASE FOR THAT PARTICULAR COMPONENT. OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS A COUNTY% TITLE BODIES OF THEIR LARGEST COUNTY BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEY ACTUALLY DIDN'T DO ANY OF THEIR OWN LICENSING PRIOR TO THE C. R. SO TAKING ON THAT ROLE WOULD. BE ENTIRELY NEW FOR THEM FOR EXAMPLE. SO- I'M THE PROPERTY THIRTY ALSO. NOT DOES JUST APPLY TO STATURE CHAIN. IT ALL APPLIES. INSTRUCTIONS THE STATE ISSUES SO ALL COUNTY LETTERS ALL COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTOR LETTERS WHICH ARE TO. KEY WAYS THAT THAT STATE COMMUNICATES WITH OUR COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES DIRECTORS ALSO HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW AND THEREFORE THEY ARE ALSO COVERED BY PROPOSITION THIRTY. SO THE QUESTION A LOOK AT IN DECIDING HOW PROPOSITION THIRTY APPLIES TO SOMETHING LIKE THE RFA IS TO SEE. WHAT WAS- EXPANDED REQUIRED AS A RESULT OF THE LEGISLATION AND THEN IT ALSO ANY SUBSEQUENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER. SO IRATE REFERRED BRIEFLY TO THAT'S IN MY TESTIMONY THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE IDEA OF MERGING TOGETHER THESE PROPHECIES OF ARMS WIFE SOMETHING OR APPROVING A FOSTER PARENT. ALSO DOING PROPHECIES RELATED TO HOME STUDIES THAT. FORUM ADOPTION OR OTHER PERMANENT THE THAT USED TO BE DONE WAY DOWN THE LINE- WHAT WE DECIDED- YES THIS CHILD IS NOT GOING TO BE REUNIFIED UNFORTUNATELY SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO A PERMANENCY PLANNING PROCESS. THOSE THINGS ARE PRETTY SEPARATE IT SO THE IDEA OF RFA WAS TO MERGE ALL THAT TOGETHER. THAT LEGISLATION WHICH WAS CARRIED BY WANTING HIM LOCKED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND SPONSORED BY CWPA CREATED FIVE PILOT PROJECTS IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH A STATEWIDE MANDATE OF. THE SYSTEM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW AT THAT POINT IN TIME EXACTLY WHAT WAS REQUIRED- BUT ASPECTS WOULD BE NEEDED. AND SO THEN TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT HAPPENED A PROPOSITION THIRTY WITH ENACTED AND THEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AB FOUR THREE CREATED THE CONTINUOUS CARE FORM AND IT IS THAT BILL PLUS THE SUBSEQUENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE SENT OUT BY THE STATE THAT CREATED THE STATEWIDE. MANDATE AND PUT MUCH MORE STE AFTER A- THE OR PA AND LAW SO WHEN THE ADMIN. SAYS NO WE DO NOT NEED TO FOR YOU FOR THE IN ACT RELATED TO OUR FAITH BECAUSE IT EXISTED BEFORE THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT IT'S JUST AN ACCURATE AND IT'S ALSO INCONSISTENT I HAVE TO SAY WITH ITS OWN PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INSTRUCTIONS. THAT STARTED BEING ISSUED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT EVEN THEMSELVES CLEARLY LIKE THE STATEWIDE MANDATE WITH AB FOR A THREE NOT WITH THAT EARLIER LEGISLATION AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK THAT OUR FAA DOES BELONG IN THE TRUE UP AND ARE ASKING FOR THAT FUNDING. I'M I MANAGED THE DEPARTMENT TO RESPOND TO WHAT CWD AID JUST SAID- AND IF YOU WANT TO BRING IN DEAL LEFT THAT'S OKAY AS WELL. THANK YOU CHAIR KEN JOHNSON- MISTER SERVICES MY WILL I DEFERRED MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THINK YOU JUST INCREASES BERMAN FINANCE- I WILL I WOULD LIKE TO ADMIT THAT I- THAT IT'S- MISTER IRVING DIDN'T. PROVIDE AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT THAT. UNDER PROPOSITION THIRTEEN ANY NEW REQUIREMENTS OF CALIFORNIANS FOR THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES RELATED ACTIVITIES AROUND LINES THAT'S ENACTED AFTER THE AFTER TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. COUNTIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO UTILIZE OR DO THAT WORK IN LAST PROVIDED TO THAT WORK- WITH REGARDS THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROGRAM I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGER THE DIFFERENCE AT THE- READING MINISTRATION IS TAKING. HIM TO CBA'S POSITION IS THAT I IS THE TIMELINE OF LEGISLATION THAT ENACTED IT SO- BROKE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS WAS ESTABLISHED CORRECTLY AS AS WAS KNOWN AS A PILOT PROGRAM. IN CHAPTER FOUR SIX WERE STATUES UNTIL TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. INCLUDED THOUGH AFTER THAT IN THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENTS- SB TEN THIRTEEN WAS THE CHANGING DIRECTION THAT I INCLUDED AMENDING LANGUAGE AND DIRECTION FOR COUNTIES ON WHAT RESPONSIBILITIES WERE REALIGNED. AND INCLUDED IN THIS WAS A CHANGE FROM I MEAN ARE EXCUSE ME AMENDING LANGUAGE FROM PILOT COUNTIES TO EARLY IMPLEMENTATION COUNTIES. SO THIS RE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PILOT PROGRAM FROM BEING AN INITIAL PHASE TO A PERMANENT STATEWIDE PROGRAM HAS BEEN- SO FOR THEM IN THE POSITION OF THE ADMINISTRATION WITH REGARDS TO THE COMMENTS ON A BEFORE I DO IS AB FOUR THREE THOSE RELATED TO THE CONTINUING CARE REFORM- PROGRAM THROUGH. THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES A LOT OF THE AMENDMENTS AND SPECIFICALLY THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL RELATED TO THAT WERE MORE TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENTS ARE RELATED TO S. B. TEN THIRTEEN OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SO. ON RECOGNIZING THAT DAY THERE IS- CONTINUE DISCUSSION MORE LIKELY GOING TO CONTINUE ON THIS- I BELIEVE A LOT OF IT COMES DOWN TO- THE TIME I OF ONE. NGUYEN THE- WAS AND- WHEN IT WAS CHANGE FROM BEING A PILOT FOR. TO FOR STATEWIDE CAN AMPLE. PROGRAM AND ALL OF THE TAKEN TO BEFORE. TO THE ELEVEN AND THEN THAT BEING INCLUDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES. I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION OFFLINE I FOUND A PART OF THAT RESPONSE- TROUBLING BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION WHERE. WE CAN HAVE A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE IN IT OR HAVE PROCESS THAT'S RIGHT. BUT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD I'D LIKE TO. EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUB COMMITTEE REQUESTS THAT ARE MADE IN THE AGENDA AT THE END OF ISSUE FOR ON PAGE. SEVENTY SIX AND- IF WE CAN. THOSE ARE FIRST THAT WE FORM A WORKING GROUP REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS INCLUDING ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS. LEGISLATIVE STAFF THE L. A. O. COUNTY REPRESENTATIVE IN PRINCIPLE CHILDREN'S ADVOCATES AND TO MEET ON A REGULAR BASIS BETWEEN NOW AND THE RELEASE OF THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISION. THIS WORKING GROUP WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX AND INTERRELATED QUESTIONS SUMMARIZED ABOVE ABOUT C. C. R. IMPLEMENTATION PANDEMIC RESPONSE AND THE FAMILIES FIRST PROTECTION ACT. TRAILER BILL TO BE RELEASED. EXCUSE ME FAMILIES FIRST PRINT. PROTECTIVE SERVICES ACT IMPLEMENTATION AND PLANNING WHICH WE ARE GOING TO WANT TO THROUGH AN EQUITY LENS SECOND WE'RE GOING TO ASK AS AN OUTGROWTH OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED WORKING GROUP AN EXPECTATION WOULD BE SET FOR A SECOND MODIFIED VERSION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECENTLY RELEASED FF PSA TRAILER BILL TO BE RELEASED BEFORE OR WITH THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION. THE FEEDBACK ALREADY RECEIVED FROM SOME OF THE ADVOCATES IS SUBSTANTIAL AND COMPLICATED AND THIS WOULD AFFORD THE ADMINISTRATION AN OPPORTUNITY TO ABSORB THE SUGGESTIONS AND MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES CAN I ASK IF THERE IS ANY FEEDBACK OR REACTION AT THIS TIME FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO THESE REQUESTS. YES JUST PRAYS FOR PLANTS CAN I JUST REITERATE OUR COMMENTS EARLIER ABOUT PRIORITIES- AND THEN- I'LL TAKE THESE BACK FOR CONSIDERATION. GREAT THANK YOU WITH THAT WE WILL. THANK VERY MUCH PANEL FOR WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL OF THE DAY PANEL FIVE ON FIRST STEPS TOWARDS REALISING THE GOALS OF THE CALIFORNIA MASTER PLAN OF AGING. WE HAVE FIFTEEN PANELISTS FOR ISSUE FIVE BEGINNING WITH DIRECTOR JOHNSON DIRECTOR JOHNSON CAN YOU PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN JOHNSON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. I'LL START WITH PROVIDING US SOME OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE SERVED IN BOTH OUR IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM AND THOSE RECEIVING SSI AND S. S. P. I TREMENDOUS AND ADULT CRITICAL ESSENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR OUR POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. OF THE OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND I. HSS RECIPIENTS I WOULD WEEKS WE CAN LOOK AT AT THE CALIFORNIA DEMOGRAPHICS COMPARED TO THE I JUST LAST POPULATION WE SEE OVER REPRESENTATION IN THOSE THAT ARE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER- AGAIN THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SERVE. OUR ELDERS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES ARE BACKED AT IN TERMS OF SPECIFICS AND I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE DOES HAVE POWER POINT SLIDES THAT HAS THIS IN DETAIL- USE OUR CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO SEVENTEEN AS RECIPIENTS ARE 8% OF ALL I JUST S. RECIPIENTS THOSE EIGHTEEN TO FORTY FOUR FOURTEEN PERCENT. AND AGAIN FORTY FIVE ALSO TO SEVENTY FIVE- IS ABOUT IT'S OVER 35% IN TERMS OF THE- AT GENDER. ARE THERE IS NO FOR OVERREPRESENTED. OF FEMALE FEMALES IN I JUST AS PROGRAM AT FIFTY NINE PERCENT. OF THE POPULATION. M. S. 50% OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S THE OVER REPRESENTATION IN TERMS OF RACE. WE SEE IN TERMS OF RATES OVER REPRESENTATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION AS COMPARED TO THE STATE'S POPULATION AS WELL AS- THOSE AT THEIR THAT COULD INCLUDE MULTIRACIAL IN OTHER CATEGORIES MORE SPECIFICALLY ALL AT ALL I JUST AS RECIPIENTS 30% OUR CONCLUSION OR WHITE 21% ASIAN AMERICAN 30% TO SPINNAKER LATINO. 14% AFRICAN AMERICAN I'M A LITTLE LESS UNDER 1% NATIVE AMERICAN AND AGAIN WE HAVE- ABOUT 4% THAT ARE NOT IDENTIFIED IN TERMS AT SS I SS P. ONE POINT OVER ONE POINT ONE MILLION RECIPIENTS. I WE SEE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVER REPRESENTATIO BASED ON THE STATE'S POPULATION IN TERMS OF AGE WE SEE THAT THOSE ZERO TO SEVENTEEN ARE 8% OF THOSE RECEIVING SSI EIGHTEEN TO FORTY FOUR FOURTEEN PERCENT- 4526422% AND OLDER. AGAIN AT ABOUT 35% AND IN TERMS OF RACE FOR THIS POPULATION. WIDER CARCASE IS OR LATINO 13% AFRICAN AMERICAN OR BLACK EIGHT PERCENT. AND WE DO HAVE A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THAT ARE NOT IDENTIFIED BY RACE OF OVER 50% SIDE I'LL NOTE THAT FOR THE DEMOGRAPHICS. THE QUESTION WAS ALSO OPPOSED TO THE DEPARTMENT RELATED TO CONCERNS WHETHER WE HAVE CONCERNS AROUND ACCESS TO EITHER OF THESE RESOURCES AND BENEFITS. AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER IN THROUGHOUT THIS- PANEL IN TODAY. WE OBVIOUSLY ARE ALWAYS OPEN AND ALWAYS THINKING THROUGH HOW WE CAN REFINE OUR APPROACHES TO ACCESS ENSURE THAT THAT'S READILY AVAILABLE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WE DID SEE A SLIGHT DECREASE IN CASELOAD IN THE I JUST S. AT PROGRAM THAN WHAT WE ANTICIPATED. HOWEVER THE CASE LOOK QUICKLY ABOUNDS BACK WE PROJECT A TWO POINT 7% INCREASE IN BUDGET. AND OF COURSE THAT NUMBER WILL BE UPLOADED EXCUSE ME UPDATED IN BAY REVISION. IN TERMS OF THE SS I SS P. CASELOAD WE HAVE SEEN A SLIGHT DECLINE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND THAT'S MAINLY DUE TO THE FACTORS. AROUND ELIGIBILITY REMAINING IN AND CHANGED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE SO WE PROJECT A DECREASE OF A LITTLE OVER 1% IN BUDGET YEAR AND AGAIN WE'LL UPDATE THAT NUMBER IN MAY REVISION. OF COURSE WE DO HAVE SOME FOCUSED EFFORTS IN THE SPACES AROUND CONNECTION TO THE COMMENTS AGAIN OF A PREVIOUS PANEL- ARE R. H. STAFF PROGRAM AND OTHERWISE IN AGAIN AS I MENTIONED ALWAYS LOOKING TO REFINE OUR ABILITY TO REACH THOSE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DEBBIE THOMPSON THE ADULT PROGRAMS DIVISION DEPUTY DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA. DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. HI DIDN'T AFTERNOON CHAIR. THANK YOU OUR MEMBERS. I AM GOING TO BE ADDRESSING THE QUESTIONS FROM THE AGENDA INCLUDING. THE ARMS. THE AFFECT OF THE 7% HOURS REDUCTION WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE ON THE ISS PROGRAM IF IT WERE IN ACTED- JUST TO BE. REALLY CLEAR THE 7% REDUCTION HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IS NOT A PROPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE BUDGET YEAR. ON IT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO- IMPLEMENTED AND WE KNOW THAT IT IS A CHALLENGE FOR OUR OUR RECIPIENTS CENTER PROVIDERS WHEN THAT OCCURS. SO WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT TO THAT SITUATION. AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO THE PURCHASING POWER FOR THAT AS A SITE G. SS I SS PETE GRANT AND HOW THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HOUSING INSTABILITY AND- HOMELESSNESS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS ON THAT RECEIVE THAT BENEFIT- WE KNOW THAT THAT. BENEFIT HAS CONTINUED TO BE VERY CLOSE TO THE POVERTY LEVEL AND THAT THAT PRESENTS A LOT OF CHALLENGES FOR FOLKS THAT ARE AREN'T RECEIVING THAT BENEFIT AND THE ADMINISTRATION. LOOKS AT THIS ISSUE REGULARLY A COUPLE YEARS AGO NOW- THERE WAS A CHANGE THAT- THAT ALLOWED NASA SCIENCE IS THE RECIPIENTS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS CALFRESH WE BELIEVE THAT WAS. A POSITIVE- IMPACTS TO THAT POPULATION AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE BETTER FOOD SECURITY AND WE KNOW THAT THE NEW PROPOSAL THAT IS THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- FOR COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION TO HELP. MITIGATE THE STABILITY OF THE BOARDING CHAIRS- AND THAT'S THE SCIENCES P. RECIPIENTS- ACCESS TO THAT. THOSE OF THE SOUL ARE NEEDED AND ALSO PUT HOW SOME. SOME BENEFIT TO THEM IS A FOCUS OF DISCUSSION ONGOING LEE AND WAS A PART OF THE DISCUSSION WITH THE MASTER PLAN AND WE CONTINUETO LOOK FOR WAYS TO SUPPORT THESE INDIVIDUALS AND- HELP THEM BE STABLE WITH WITH MEETING THEIR HOUSING AS WELL AS- FOOD AND OTHER. NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO BE STABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL MOVE NOW TO DIRECTOR KIMBERLY MCCOY WADE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING. GOOD AFTERNOON KIM QUITE AWAY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN AND BUDGET AND DEPARTMENT OF AGING. OFF FIRST YOU ARE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT BUDGET INVESTMENTS FOR THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING IT AGAIN AS YOU HAVE HEARD ARE THERE ARE MANY LAYERED INTO DEPARTMENTS ACROSS HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND SOCIAL SERVICES. I SEE A COUPLE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO LIFT UP. OUR FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLACEHOLDER FOR MASTER PLAN FOR AGING IMPLEMENTATION PARTNER BEIJING- PLAYS THE ROLE OF SUPPORTING ALL DEPARTMENTS AND ALL AGENCIES IMPLEMENTING THEIR AGING AGENDAS AND COORDINATING IT AND EVERYBODY ACCOUNTABILITY AND STAKEHOLDER OVERSIGHT AND INPUT. ALSO THAT'S OKAY A KEY- BUDGET INVESTMENT AS WELL AS THE NEW GOVERNOR'S OFFICE A SENIOR ADVISER ON AGING DISABILITY AN ALICE HYMERS HIS PROPOSED. A SECOND- AND- WE WOULD SAY MARQUIS PROPOSAL IS TO CREATE THAT NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM STATEWIDE. SO THAT ANY OLDER PERSON OR PERSON DISABILITY OR FAMILY CAREGIVER CAN EASILY FIND THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO NAVIGATE TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED- THE NO WRONG DOOR EIGHTY R. C. IS PROPOSED TO GO STATEWIDE IN IN THE BUDGET. I WOULD THROUGH THROUGH GRANTS TO OUR NETWORK OF- AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND APARTMENT REHABILITATION'S. NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS. FATHERS ALL THE IT CONTINUE. OF THE- SEVENTY POINT FIVE MILLION FOR NUTRITION SUSPENSION DATAS ARE SHIFTED AS ASTHE OVERALL BUDGET APPROACH AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER YEAR OF INVESTMENT ARE CRITICAL NUTRITION PROGRAMS- AND THEN SOMETIME EXTENSION TO SPEND. THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF FALLS PREVENTION MONEY ARE CRITICAL TO KEEPING. OLDER ADULTS SAFE AT HOME. OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. ARE THERE ARE YOU MENTIONED- AND MRS P. AND- BUT THOSE ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY- INVESTED. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THEN JUST ONE QUICK NOTE ON THE OVERALL CONTEXT- AS WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHER DIRECTORS. THE FORCED- FEDERAL AID PACKAGE IS ON ITS WAY UP WITH THE LATEST ONE ARE PROVIDING AT CLOSE TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. DOLLARS FOR THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAM SO THERE CONTINUES TO BE I NEEDED. A AND VITAL. FEDERAL SUPPORT IN THE MIX AS WELL. YOU ALSO HAVE SPECIFICALLY BUT HER SHE WOULD SHOWS REMAIN OUR LARGEST PROGRAM. LIKE ALL MEALS PROGRAMS WE EXPANDED AND OF COURSE COMMITTED FROM A MIX OF HOME DELIVERED. AND CONGREGATE MEALS LIKE YOU MIGHT SEE A SENIOR CENTER ARE THOSE ALL WENT HOME- AND SO I'M VERY PROUD OF OUR NETWORK THAT NOT ONLY DID WE PUT IT TO BE ENTIRELY HOME DELIVERY. WE GREW BY CLOSE 260% A YEAR TO YEAR SO WE WENT FROM EIGHTEEN MILLION MEALS IN 201-922-0222 TWENTY EIGHT MILLION MEALS IN TWENTY TWENTY. ON NEARLY 60% INCREASE AND THAT WAS A COMBINATION OF FACTORS THAT WAS PEOPLE WE ALREADY SERVE WHO NEEDED MORE MEALS THEY STAYED HOME. IT WAS PEOPLE WHO WERE STAYING HOME I TEMPORARILY WHICH COURSE DRAGGED ON FOR CONTINUE TO DRAG ON. AND SO NO WAIT NO LONGER ABLE TO GO TO CONGREGATE MEAL SITE OR MAYBE HAVE FAMILY SUPPORT OR DO GROCERY SHOPPING. WE HAVE FOLKS NEED NEWLY IN NEED OF AND THAT IS GOING TO PERSIST BECAUSE OF A HEALTH CHANGE OR FAMILY SITUATION CHANGER HOUSING CHANGE. AND THEN OF COURSE WE JUST HAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE AWARENESS- THANKS IN PART TO. THE GREAT PLACE PROGRAM AND OTHER PARTNERSHIPS THAT REALLY EXPANDED MEALS WHEN PEOPLE NEEDED IT. SO WE ARE. VERY MUCH MINDFUL OF. THE OLDEST EXPAND IN THE- FOR FINE. WHETHER IT'S IN TELL. GRAY PLACE TO THE OLDER MAN. ACT OF MEALS ON WHEELS PROGRAMS HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO MEET THE NEED MATCH THE RIGHT. NUTRITION SUPPORT WITH WITH FOLKS WHEN AND WHERE THEY NEEDED. AND WE HAVE OUR EYE ON A COMING CLIFF OF FEDERAL FUNDS AGAIN WITH THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN WE'VE GOT. MORE FUNDS AND MORE TIME BUT REALLY WANT TO MANAGE- AT THAT AND SO THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENTS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US GOING FORWARD IN THE POST CODE LANDSCAPE. AND THEN CONTINUING TO SUPPORT OUR NETWORK. WITH BETTER DATA SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO MEET THE NEEDS. THE LAST QUESTION YOU ASKED. ABOUT BOTH- MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUE LONG TERM CARE- BUT CERTAIN HIGHEST PRIORITY CHALLENGES. AND HERE'S THE THREE THAT WERE FOCUSED ON. RECOVERING FROM KOBE NINETEEN THE DEVASTATING IMPACT ON OLDER CALIFORNIANS THAT OUR FAMILIES. OUT RENDERING INEQUITIES BY RACE AND AGE AND GENDER THAT ARE OUT. REALLY MAKING AGING EXPERIENCE VERY DIFFERENT AND VERY LIKABLE IN CALIFORNIA. IN THREE REBUILDING BETTER WE'RE NOT GOING BACK TO THE WAY WE DID THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED TOO MUCH INCOME TO FAR SO HOW DO WE REBUILD BETTER SO WE'RE GONNA BE LASER FOCUSED ON HOME AND COMMUNITY SERVICES THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO STAY AT HOME. AND AVOID UNNECESSARY INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE PROGRAMS THE FOOD PROGRAMS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT HELP PEOPLE THRIVE AT HOME AND THEN AS I HANDED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO THE STATE LONG TERM CARE ON BUT- ALSO THE SECOND PRIORITY IS- WHAT CAN WE DO TO INTEGRATE IN A RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES BASED NURSING HOME SPACE. WHERE OF FAR TOO MANY NEARLY A THIRD DESPITE BEING LESS THAN 1% OF THE POPULATION. SO THERE'S SO MANY LESSONS TO LEARN TO GO FORWARD IN OUR NURSING HOME AND RESIDENTIAL SPACE- AND THEN LASTLY. WE TAKE OUR ROLE VERY SERIOUSLY AS UP ENGAGING AROUND AGING COMMUNICATING AROUND AGE AND THAT DOESN'T JUST MEAN INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE IT ALSO MEANS COMMUNICATING ABOUT AGEISM AND RACISM AND OF COURSE AT THIS MOMENT THE PARTICULAR TAX ON. A OLDER API'S IN IN OUR STATE AND OUR NATION AND SO THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE FOCUSED IS ADDRESSING AGEISM- INNOVATING IN NURSING HOMES AND EXPANDING HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES SO WE CAN ALL THRIVE IN THE HOMES WE CHOOSE. SO WITH THAT- I WILL SAY ALL OF THAT WORK DEPENDS ON DEEP DEEP DEEP PARTNERSHIPS. WITH OUR LOCAL LEADERS AGING IS IN YOUR HOME IN OUR COMMUNITY SO I WANT TO JUST THANK IN ADVANCE OUR PARTNERS IN PARTICULAR FROM AREA AGENCIES ON AGING IN INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS BUT ALSO THE COUNTIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUS PARTNERS IN RESPONDING TO COBIT AND THINKING ABOUT THE WAY FORWARD AND OF COURSE THE COMMISSION ON AGING. SO WITH THAT I'LL FINISH AND JUST I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- AS- GEORGIE GETS COMES NEXT ALL HE HAS BEEN OUR STATE LONG TERM CARE ON BUT FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS. AND I WILL BE RETIRING SHORTLY SO THIS WILL BE LAST UP HERE AND WITH THE WHICH IS. TO AT TAKE THIS PHONE TO POP THANK HIM FOR HIS SERVICE AND THING YOU FOR THE- TO DO SO. THANK YOU DIRECTOR- WITHOUT ADO JOE RODRIGUEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ANYWAY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU DIRECTOR WAIT FOR THOSE COMMENTS- THE MISSION OF THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS TO SEEK RESOLUTION OF PROBLEMS AND ADVOCATE FOR THE RIGHTS OF RESIDENTS OF LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. IT WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THEIR DIGNITY THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND THEIR QUALITY OF CARE. WE MONITORING ADVOCATE FOR CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. AND POLICIES TO BENEFIT RESIDENTS BY TAKING POSITIONS ON BILLS THE PROVIDING TESTIMONY TO THE LEGISLATURE. SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THIRTY FIVE LOCAL OMBUDSMAN ENTITIES WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE PART TIME AND FULL TIME PAID STAFF AND FIVE HUNDRED AND. EIGHT VOLUNTEER OMBUDSMEN REPRESENTATIVES. I WOULD YEAR REPRESENTATIVES RECEIVED TRAINING ON HOW TO SAFELY CONDUCT VISITS WITH THE APPROPRIATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO US BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. DESPITE BEING LOCKED OUT OF LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES A YEAR AGO AND FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THIS PAST YEAR ALMOST REPRESENTATIVES INVESTIGATED MORE THAN TWENTY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY COMPLAINTS. MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF RESIDENTS. WE PROVIDED INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE TO MORE THAN SIX SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND FACILITIES STAFF. WE MADE THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOURTEEN SIXTY FOUR VISITS TO LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES TO MONITOR. MONITOR CONDITIONS AND FACILITIES AND RESPOND TO COMPLAINTS. LOCAL ALARM BUZZER PROGRAMS REPORT THAT OVER THE PAST YEAR ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THEY HAVE FACED IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN ALL THE GUIDANCE THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE LICENSING AND REGULATORY AGENCIES. HE NEED TO CARE LICENSING AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ISSUEDEIGHTY PROVIDER INFORMATION NOTICES WHILE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE EIGHTY FIVE ALL FACILITY LETTERS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY. A RELATED CHALLENGE WAS HOW THAT GUIDANCE WAS INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY BY REGULATORS FACILITIES STAFF AND ENVOYS AND REPRESENTATIVES. INITIALLY VOLUNTEER ON BUT THE REPRESENTATIVES WERE VERY RELUCTANT TO GO INTO LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES THE FEAR OF CONTRACTING CORONAVIRUS. RINGING THE VIRUS INTO THE FACILITY ARENA VIRUS HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES. MANY ON BUT THE REPRESENTATIVES ARE IN AT RISK GROUPS. MANY STAFF OR OLDER ADULTS THEMSELVES AND COULD BE RELUCTANT AS WELL. IN JUST ONE YEAR WE HAVE LOST TWO HUNDRED NINE VOLUNTEERS WERE RESIGNED MOSTLY BECAUSE OF A RELUCTANCE TO GOING TO FACILITIES. LOCAL OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO BE MORE RELIANT ON STAFF TO CONDUCT THE WORK OF THE OFFICE. LOCAL PROGRAMS WILL NEED RESOURCES TO HIRE STAFF UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO CONDUCT A STATEWIDE VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT INITIATIVE. VIRTUAL VISITS WHICH WE PERMITTED TO DURING THE PANDEMIC USING SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS ARE NOT AN IDEAL FORM OF COMMUNICATION. MANY RESIDENTS ARE RELIANT UPON FACILITIES STAFF TO FACILITATE THIS CONTACT. CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY ARE RAISED BY THIS PRACTICE. IT MAY BE ALSO DIFFICULT FOR SOME RESIDENTS TO HEAR SEE OR UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEING SAID INVICRO. OVER THE PAST YEAR TESTING FROM BUZZING REPRESENTATIVES IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE AT TIMES DEPENDING ON THE AVAILABILITY OF TESTING AND THE FREQUENCY OF TESTING. REPRESENTATIVES MAKING VISITS TO FACILITIES NOW ARE TESTED WEEKLY. WHEN POSITIVITY RATES IN THE COUNTY EXCEEDED 10% RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVES WERE BEING TESTED TWICE A WEEK. DURING THE HOLIDAYS THIS BECAME A REAL CHALLENGE. I AM ENCOURAGED BY THE VACCINATIONS OF RESIDENTS FACILITIES STAFF NUMBERS AND REPRESENTATIVES CASES ARE DOWN CONSIDERABLY VISITS TO DISABILITIES BY ON BY THE REPRESENTATIVES ARE GOING UP. WHEN WE FINALLY RESTARTED OUR VISIT IN JULY OF LAST YEAR WE MADE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY VISITS A MONTH OF JULY. LAST MONTH FEBRUARY ON BY THE REPRESENTATIVES MADE MORE THAN TWENTY ONE HUNDRED VISITS TO FACILITIES. WITH THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES RECENT DIRECTION THE FACILITY SHOULD ALWAYS ALLOW RESPONSIBLE INDOOR AND OUTDOOR VISITATION FOR ALL RESIDENTS REGARDLESS OF VACCINATION STATUS OF THE RESIDENT FOR THE VISITORS. I'M HOPING THAT WE TURNED A CORNER AND RESIDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO SEE AND HOLD THEIR LOVED ONES AGAIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU STERN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PUBLIC SERVICE. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JACKIE BOROUGH SEAL FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HEY JACKIE BURKE ROCHELLE WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE. I'M IN RESPONSE TO THE FIRST QUESTION IN THE AGENDA AND THIS PAST FALL OUR OFFICE LOOKED INTO LTSS PROGRAM CAPACITY IN THE STATE IN WHICH WE FOUND THAT THE AVAILABILITY AND UTILIZATION OF LTSS PROGRAMS IS UNEVEN ACROSS THE STATE I'M AS IT RELATES TO AVAILABILITY SOME LTSS PROGRAMS- ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN ALL COUNTIES AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT CAN BE SERVED IN SOME PROGRAMS IS CAPPED. IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION WE LOOKED AT WHAT SHARE OF MEDICAL SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE ENROLLED IN DIFFERENT LTSS PROGRAMS IN EVERY COUNTY AND IN COMPARING THOSE UTILIZATION RATES ACROSS COUNTIES WE FOUND THAT LTSS UTILIZATION TENDS TO BE LOWER AND EASTERN SIERRA COUNTIES. AND UTILIZATION RATES TEND TO BE HIGHER AND I'M THREE PARTICULAR URBAN COUNTY SPECIFICALLY SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE THE VARIATION IN UTILIZATION RATES ACROSS COUNTIES MAY BE INDICATIVE AB ACCESS ISSUES EITHER BECAUSE PROGRAMS ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN SOME COUNTIES OR THERE MAY BE POTENTIAL BARRIERS AND PROVIDING SERVICES TO ALL ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS IN CERTAIN AREAS. AS FAR. OF FUTURE DEMAND WE IDENTIFIED- CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT MAY IMPACT DEMAND TRENDS SUCH AS- THE FACT THAT THE SENIOR POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE STATE'S POPULATION AS A WHOLE. ALSO THE FACT THAT THE SENIOR POPULATION IS BECOMING MORE RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AND SENIORS ARE PROJECTED TO LIVE LONGER AND THAT MATTERS BECAUSE FOR THOSE PARTICULAR SUBGROUPS. I'M THEY TEND TO HAVE HIGHER DISABILITY RATES MEANING THAT THE SHARE SENIORS OR THE NUMBER OF SENIORS I'M IN PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES THAT MAY REQUIRE LTSS SERVICES- MAY BE GREATER IN THE FUTURE. IN DETERMINING THE OF THE ABILITY OF THE STATE OF STATE LTSS PROGRAMS TO THEN RESPONDS TO POTENTIAL RISING DEMAND WE ASSESS THE FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF CURRENT PROGRAM DESIGN AND RULES. FOR EXAMPLE LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE SOME PROGRAMS ARE CONSTRAINED- IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN STARVE- ADDITIONALLY SOME PROGRAMS ARE CONSTRAINED- IN PROVIDING SERVICES ANY FIXED FACILITY SETTING. ADDITIONALLY SOME PROGRAMS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MEDIC CAL ELIGIBILITY RULES I'M THAT LIMIT THE NUMBER OF SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES THEY CAN START. WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS THAT START UP COSTS ARE A BARRIER TO EXPANDING SERVICES IN NEW COUNTIES AND ADDITIONALLY REGIONAL VARIATION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF PROVIDERS- ALSO PRESENTS A CHALLENGE I'M IN MEETINGS NOT ONLY CURRENT POSSIBLY FUTURE PROGRAM DEMAND. MOVING ON TO THE SECOND QUESTION- WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESSIBILITY WITHIN THE I JUST AS ENORMOUS AS P. PROGRAM AND I JUST SAYS WE HAVE HEARD ANECDOTALLY THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF PROVIDERS I'M SPECIFICALLY IN AREAS IN WHICH RECIPIENTS ARE EIGHT AND IT FOR RECIPIENTS THAT LIVE IN ISOLATED AREAS OR HAVE COMPLEX CARE NEEDS- MAYBE- LIMIT. ACCESSIBILITY LEVELS AND IN THE CASE OF M. S. S. P. THE FACT THAT THE PROGRAM IS NOT AVAILABLE IN ALL COUNTIES BUT ALSO- PARTICIPATION IS CAPPED ALSO PRESENT ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES. WHEN IT COMES TO FRAGMENTATION BEYOND THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES I'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED ANOTHER FORMER FRAGMENTATION THAT OUR OFFICE HAS EXPLORED THAT APPLIES TO ALL LTSS PROGRAMS INCLUDES FRAGMENTATION IN THE AND TAKE AN ASSESSMENT PROCESS. SO WHILE LTSS PROGRAMS MAY HAVE SIMILAR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AN INDIVIDUAL NAMED STILL NEEDS TO GO THROUGH SEPARATE INTAKE ASSESSMENT PROCESS SEES FOR EACH PROGRAM. SO NOT ONLY DOES THAT PRESENT- DUPLICATIVE ADMINISTRATIVELY INEFFICIENT PRACTICE SAYS BUT FOR THE RECIPIENT AND MAY ALSO PRESENT CARE COORDINATION ISSUES IF THE INFORMATION COLLECTED IN ONE PROGRAM IS IT NECESSARILY ACCESSIBLE OR SHARED WITH- CARE PROVIDERS- CARE COORDINATORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS. THAT WOULD THEN HELP TO BETTER ASSESS ANY POTENTIAL SERVICE GAPS FOR THAT RESPOND FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL AND WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOGRAPHICS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE SENIOR POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO BE MORE RACIALLY IN COAL AND I'M CULTURALLY DIVERSE AND THAT JUST RAISES QUESTIONS. FOR ALL LTSS PROGRAMS ON LANGUAGE ACCESS AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY OF CULTURAL COMPETENCY OF CARE. ALSO THE INCREASING NUMBER OF SENIORS WITH DISABILITIES AND POSSIBLY MORE SENIORS WITH COMPLEX CARE NEEDS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HAVING THE ADEQUATE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS TO NOT ONLY MEET THAT POTENTIAL INCREASING DEMAND OF SERVICES BUT ALSO THE SPECIFIC CARE NEEDS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL. MOVING ON TO THE THIRD QUESTION. ONE WAY IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE COULD CHANGE PROGRAM AVAILABILITY- IS BY CHANGING THE PROGRAM RULES AND DESIGN ELEMENTS THAT I LISTED BEFORE. I'M THAT COULD INCLUDE INCREASING OR REMOVING I'M JUST A PARTICIPATION CAPS FOR SOME PROGRAMS IT COULD ALSO INCLUDE EXPLORING ON THE BENEFITS AND TRADE OFFS OF PROVIDING SOME LEVEL OF STATE ASSISTANCE TO PROGRAMS SO- SO THAT THEY CAN EXPAND TO OTHER COUNTIES- BY PROVIDING ASSISTANCE WITH THOSE START UP COSTS- AND THINGS LIKE THAT. MOVING ON TO THE FOURTH QUESTION- WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE OUR OFFICE VIEWS THE SUSPENSION MECHANISM AS TREATING ONGOING PROGRAM COST AS TEMPORARY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERSTATES THE TRUE ONGOING COST OF THE STATE'S POLICY COMMITMENTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE OF I JUST LAST WHICH IS AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE TREATS A PORTION OF THE I. JUST A SERVICE HOURS. AS TEMPORARY WHEREAS I JUST A SERVICE HOURS REFLECT BE ASSESSED LEVEL OF. I'M SERVICES NEEDED BY AN INDIVIDUAL ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOME. ADDITIONALLY AUTOMATING THE SUSPENSION OF FUNDING FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS HINDERS THE LEGISLATURE- FROM WEIGHING THE TRADE OFFS OF ALL POSSIBLE OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO CONSIDERING HOW TO MANAGE ANY PROJECTED BUDGET SHORTFALL THAT COULD MATERIALIZE IN FUTURE BUDGET YEARS. THUS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MAINTAIN THE BUDGET BILL SUSPENSION LANGUAGE. I'M MOVING ON TO THE FIFTH QUESTION WITHIN THE AGENDA- WE WOULD JUST FLAG THAT DURING COLD IN NINETEEN THE STATE HAS IT AND DID IMPLEMENTED MANY PROGRAM FLEXIBILITIES TO REDUCE FACE TO FACE. INTERACTIONS AND MAINTAIN SERVICE DELIVERY FOR RECIPIENTS FOR EXAMPLE- WITHIN THE I JUSTAS PROGRAM THE STATE ESTABLISHED AN EMERGENCY BACKUP PROVIDER SYSTEM IN EVERY COUNTY OVERALL THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO REQUEST FROM THE ADMINISTRATION A LIST OF THOSE COPING NINETEEN PROGRAM FLEXIBILITIES ACROSS- I JUST SAYS EXERCISE IS P. R. A. P. S. WHAT IMPACT DID THOSE FLEXIBILITIES HAVE. ON RETAINING INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE PROGRAM AND WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS AND TRADE OFFS AND MAINTAINING THOSE PROGRAM FLEXIBILITIES. BEYOND COPE AT NINETEEN. AS FOR THE LAST QUESTION. AND THE I JUST US RECIPIENT I JUST AS RECIPIENTS WHO LOSE THEIR MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY BECAUSE- THEY DID NOT COMPLETE THE ANNUAL MEDICAL RENEWAL PROCESS I'M CURRENTLY ARE EXPECTED TO BE MANUALLY TERMINATED FROM THE I JUST US PROGRAM I'M MEANING THAT THEY CAN ONLY RETURN ONCE THEY RE ESTABLISH THEIR MEDIC CAL HOWEVER NOT EVERYONE WHO LOSES THEIR MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY IS MANUALLY TERMINATED FOR MIGHT JUST US. SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE RECIPIENT IS- INTERNALLY TRANSFERRED INTO THE I JUST AS RESIDUAL PROGRAM MEANING THAT SERVICES ARE BEING FULLY PAID FOR BY THE STATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WOULD AUTOMATE THE TERMINATION PROCESS FOR I JUST SAYS WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL DOES LOSE THEIR MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY I'M SO THAT EFFECTIVELY THEN ELIMINATES THE POSSIBILITY THAT A RECIPIENT WHO LOSES THEIR MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY DUE TO NOT COMPLETING THE MEDIC OUR NEW ALL PROCESS- THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES THROUGH THE I JUST RESIDUAL PROGRAM- AND ENSURES THAT EVERY RECIPIENT WOULD THEN NEED TO FIRST RAIN ROLL INTO MEDIC CAL. BEFORE THE- BEGIN TO RECEIVE PAID SERVICES. THROUGH I JUST US AGAIN. THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT ALL I JUST AS RECENT AND BY THIS ITEM PROCESS. BE REINSTATED INTO MEDIC CAL WILL RETURN TO AYE IT JUST SAYS WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THEIR PROVIDER DURING THAT GAP IN MEDIC CALLIN I JUST AS ELIGIBILITY AND THAT THE PROVIDER WILL BE RETROACTIVELY REIMBURSE FOR THOSE SERVICES PROVIDED IN THE GAP. IN ELIGIBILITY HOWEVER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME RECIPIENTS MAY EXPERIENCE THE DESTRUCTION CARE OR MAY NOT RETURN TO MEDICAL OR I JUST SIZE- SO IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO ADOPT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WE WOULD SUGGEST ASKING THE DEPARTMENT TO MONITOR AND REPORT BACK ON ONE. HOW LONG IT TAKES A RECIPIENT TO REINSTATE THEIR MEDIC HAL AND I JUST ELIGIBILITY. TO WHAT EXTENT DID RECIPIENTS EXPERIENCE OF DESTRUCTION AND CARE AND THREE THE NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS HOLDEN BELIEVE MAY NOT HAVE RETURNED TOO MANY CALORIES JUST LAST. ALL IF THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT ADOPT THAT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT COULD CONSIDER WHETHER THE I JUST AS RESIDUAL PROGRAM- COULD SERVE AS A TEMPORARY SAFETY NET FOR ALL RECIPIENTS WERE TEMPORARILY- HER TERMINATED FROM MEDIC HELL AND NO LONGER RECEIVE I JUST ASK AS A MEDICAL BENEFIT. AS FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE QUESTION IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT SINCE CURRENTLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SUSPENDED MEDI CAL RENEWALS FOR THE DURATION OF THE COLBERT NINETEEN DECLARATION. THAT ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT NO RECIPIENT IS AT RISK OF LOSING I JUST ASK- DUE TO LOSING THEIR MEDIC HOW- BY NOT COMPLETING THE RENEWAL PROCESS. BUT WHILE MEDICAL RENEWALS ARE TEMPORALLY SUSPENDED IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME RECIPIENTS MAY STILL BE RECEIVING THEIR MEDICAL RENEWAL PACKETS. AND IT'S UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN SOME COUNTIES THE MAILING OF THOSE PACKETS IS- AUTOMATICALLY CODED WITHIN THE SYSTEM. HOWEVER AGAIN RECIPIENTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILL OUT OR SUBMIT THOSE MEDIC CAL ANNUAL RENEWAL PACKETS BUT IF THEY DO COUNTIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROCESS THOSE PACKETS. HOWEVER ONCE AND THE NATIONAL DECLARATION ENDS IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT BASED OFF OF RECENT FEDERAL GUIDANCE THE STATE WILL BE REQUIRED TO GO BACK AND COMPLETE THOSE RENEWALS THAT WERE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED WITHIN A SIX MONTH TIME PERIOD. SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON. HOW WILL ENSURE THAT RECIPIENTS ARE AWARE OF THAT MEDICARE WOULD NEW WILL RETURN TO TAKE RETURN WE DIRT REDETERMINATION CHANGE AND THE POSSIBLE INTERACTING AFFECTS BETWEEN. COUNTIES PROCESSING THAT BUILDUP A MEDIC CAL RENEWALS WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUTOMATED I JUST S. TERMINATION PROCESS. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JOHN LEWIS THE AUDIT PRINCIPAL FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- JOHN LEWIS CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TALK ABOUT OUR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR FEBRUARY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AUDIT OF THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM I'M GONNA FOCUS ON THREE AREAS- IN THE PRESENTATION I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE- WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW THE NEED FOR CARE IS GROWING. THE DELAYS IN APPROVAL AND PROVISION OF CARE AND THE FACT THAT I AGES OF WORKERS MAKE- AT OR NEAR MINIMUM WAGE WHICH IS FAIRLY FAR OFF FROM A LIVING WAGE IN CALIFORNIA- THE WRONG THINGS THAT WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT BY THE LEGISLATURE- IN TWENTY NINETEEN. ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND. RECIPIENTS ON AVERAGE EACH MONTH DID NOT RECEIVE CARE. THIS NUMBER IS UP FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN IT WAS ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND. A PERSON PERSPECTIVE OVER THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION HOURS OF CARE. THAT WERE APPROVED. BUT HAD NOT BEEN PROVIDED. ARE THESE GAPS IN CARE CAN OCCUR FOR A LOT OF REASONS. INCLUDING ANY INABILITY TO HIRE A CARE GIVER OR- AN INSTANCE WHERE A RECIPIENT HAS MOVED. AND THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE FINDING A NEW CARE GIVER. STATE LAW REQUIRES COUNTIES TO ENSURE THE CARE IS PROVIDED. THROUGH IHS TO ALL RECIPIENTS- AND THIRTY TWO OF FIFTY ONE COUNTIES THAT WE SURVEYED ABOUT THIS RESPONDED THAT THEY LACKED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CARE GIVERS TO PROVIDE ALL RECIPIENTS WITH APPROVED SERVICES. THIS IS BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT AS ABOTH LOCAL SERVICES IN THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE POINTED OUT BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF THE INDIVIDUALS OVER SIXTY FIVE IS GROWING. AND THEY ALSO REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF IT JUSTICE RECIPIENT- WE ESTIMATE THAT BY THE END OF THE DECADE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SERVED THROUGH I. HFS COULD GROW FROM ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND. TO ABOUT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT JUMP- AND IT WILL REQUIRE MORE CARE GIVERS. B. WE FOUND IN OUR AUDIT THAT- COUNTIES ARE TAKING AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY TWO DAYS. TO APPROVED APPLICANTS FOR I. H. AT THE THIRD OF THE- SO PER THE REQUIRED COUNTY TO DO THIS IN ABOUT THIRTY DAYS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS. WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTDOESN'T TRACK THOSE EXCEPTIONS- MORE SPECIFICALLY MOST RECIPIENTS COMING TO THE PROGRAM RECEIVE SERVICES FROM A FAMILY MEMBER OR FOR SOMEONE CLOSE TO THEM BASICALLY THEY COME TO THE PROGRAM WITH A RECIPIENT. HOWEVER A LARGE NUMBER OF ABOUT 15% OF THE RECALL DON'T. AND THAT NUMBER IS LIKELY TO GROW OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS OF THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA REPORTED THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE ARE JUST GETTING OLDER BUT THEY'RE CHANGING YOU HAVE FAMILIES WHERE THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED OR LOOK LIKELY TO HAVE CHILDREN WHO WOULD BE WATCHING THEM THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE AN EVEN GREATER FOCUS ON NON FAMILY CAREGIVERS ON GETTING RECIPIENTS MATCHED WITH CARE GIVERS. THEY DON'T ALREADY KNOW THAT THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY ARRANGED FOR- ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT COUNTIES BEGIN TO CONDUCT PLANNING AROUND. THE PROVISION OF CARE. THIS IS ACTUALLY REQUIREMENT IN STATE LAW AND IT'S BEEN IN STATE LAW FOR QUITE SOME TIME. BUT COUNTY IS NOT A COUNTIES NORTH OF FOCAL BERMAN COULD PROVIDE US WITH AN EXAMPLE OF ANY ANY ANNUAL REPORT THAT ANY COUNTY HAD DONE IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE THEY DONE DAYS- SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING THE COUNTIES BEGIN DOING SO IMMEDIATELY AND THAT THEY INCLUDE IN. THESE ANNUAL REPORTS- AN EXAMINATION OF. WHAT FUTURE NEEDS MIGHT BE- IN OUR SURVEY ONLY TWO COUNTIES REPORTED CONDUCTING ANY KIND OF PLANNING FOR CURRENT OR FUTURE CARE GIVER NEEDS BUT AGAIN NO ONE HAD SUBMITTED THESE PLANS OFFICIALLY TO SOCIAL SERVICE. BOB DE FINAL ELEMENT WE LOOKED AT WAGES CAREGIVER WAGES COMPARE THEM TO THE LIVING WAGE AS CALCULATED BY THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY- ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE STATE IN TWENTY NINETEEN CARE GIVERS EARNED A LITTLE OVER TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. THE LIVING WAGE AT THAT TIME WAS ABOUT TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AN HOUR THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT GAP- IN THE FOUR COUNTIES THAT WE LOOKED AT IN DETAIL THEY ALL HAD SIMILAR GAPS. THE RESULT OF THIS IS THAT AS COUNTIES NEED TO RECRUIT CAREGIVERS IN THE FUTURE THESE LOWER WAGES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FIND CARE GIVERS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE BROUGHT UP WAS THAT- SOME ELEMENTS OF STATE LAW PENALIZE COUNTY THAT GET AHEAD OF THE MINIMUM WAGE AND TRY TO RAISE CAREGIVER WAGES A LITTLE BIT IN ADVANCE OF WHEN THE MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP. AND BECAUSE OF THAT A LOT OF COUNTIES HAD BACKTRACKED YOU. JUST PROVIDING MINIMUM WAGE- I JUST THE CARE GIVERS ALTHOUGH A RECENT CHANGE IN LAW HAS HAVE RELAXED THAT SOMEONE IN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COUNTIES NOW THAT HAVE PAID TO THEIR- AGES AS WE DO. TO THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND THEY'RE A TO ALLOW HIM TO RAISE THEM A LITTLE BIT ABOVE. THE MINIMUM WAGE. BUT WHEN THESE WAGES STAY THAT LOW. THEY ARE COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER LOW WAGE JOBS AND SO FINDING THESE CARE GIVERS CAN BECOME A CHALLENGE- OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS AREA INCLUDED- AGAIN GETTING RID OF THIS PENALTY THAT- COUNTIES HAVE TO PAY EXTRA IF THEY GET AHEAD OF THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND ALSO- THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER SOME BUDGET AUGMENTATION FOR COUNTIES ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH A WIDE GAP BETWEEN. THE CAREGIVER WAGES IN THE LIVING WAGE YOU TO HELP THEM RAISE CAREGIVER WAGES SO. MIKE HELLO THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM BEVERLY YOU STATE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS ASK ME. MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST BEVERLY YOU ON BEHALF OF YOU W. ASKED ME LOCAL THREE NINE THIRTY REPRESENTING OVER A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND HOME CARE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN THIRTY NINE COUNTIES THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE HEARING TODAY AND THANKS ALSO TO THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH FOR WORKING WITH US REQUEST THE AUDIT. AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM MR LEWIS THE IG SAYS PROGRAM IS IN CRISIS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF PREPARATION AND LOW WAGES THE NEED FOR CARISBROOKE FAR FASTER THAN THE CARE WORKFORCE CAN MEET. UNLESS WE TAKE ACTION NOW TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN PROVIDERS THOUSANDS OF OLDER ADULTS INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES MINGLING CARED FOR FACE UNNECESSARY INSTITUTIONAL CARE. IN REGARDS TO THE QUESTION WHICH INITIATIVES PROVIDES THIS PROGRAM ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO GROW TO CARE WORK FORCES TO MAKE CONDITIONS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL CONDUCIVE TO PAY INCREASES THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. HISTORICALLY THE NON FEDERAL SHARE OF COSTS FOR LOCALLY NEGOTIATED WAGE AND BENEFIT INCREASES I JUST AS HAS BEEN PAID BY THE COUNTY. SB EIGHTY TWENTY NO. THE FUNDING FORMULA WILL SLIP IN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IS THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD MAINTAIN ITS RESPONSIBILITY AS 65% AND A COUNTY HAVE SIXTY ACT 35% EXCUSE ME IN ORDER FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS TO REACH ANY BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. ALONG WITH SEIU IN THE COUNTIES WE PROPOSE RESCINDING THE SIXTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE COST FLIP MAINTAINING THE 10% OVER THREE YEARS SCHOOL AND THE STATE CAN ALSO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN ADDRESSING THIS CARE CRISIS BY PERMANENTLY RESTORING THE 7% CUT TO ENSURE RECIPIENTS DON'T LOSE ANY ADDITIONAL HOURS TO CARE AS IDENTIFIED BY THE AUDIT. MOVING ALONG TO DRESS THE QUESTION CAN EFFECTIVE SENTENCE BE CREATED TO FACILITATE LOCAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS NUMBER OF I JUST AS WAGES AND BENEFITS. OUR ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY. WELL YOU W. S. YEAH YOU SUPPORT ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOING TO THE COUNTIES TO MAINTAIN EXISTING BARGAINING TOOLS. BOTH UNITS ARE REQUESTING YOUR CONSIDERATION FOR A STRONGER PENALTY FOR COUNTIES THAT DO NOT BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH TO BRING THESE COUNTIES TO THE TABLE. THE TOOLS WE AREREQUESTING WITH THE COUNTY SHOULD NOT BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PENALTY AS THE COUNTY'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED A DO NOT BURKE IN GOOD FAITH. AS WELL AS A FACT FINDING MEDIATION PROCESS. IS TALL EXPIRED JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR IT DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH. IF YOU WOULD LIKE PROOF TAKE A LOOK AT KERN COUNTY THAT HAS A HAD A CONTRACT FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. YOU COUNTY FOR SIX AND A HALF YEARS AND LASSEN COUNTY AS THE ONLY COUNTY THAT HAVE THE REACH THE CONTRACT. WHAT WILL WORK TO GET THIS THESE WERE. COUNTY TO COME TO THE TABLE IS A 10% FISCAL PENALTY. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THE ONLY COUNTIES WILL FAIL TO BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH WILL. BE IMPACTED BY THIS PENALTY. AND THE PENALTY WITH A SENSE. LOWERING THE AMOUNT OF FOR. THE COUNTY WE RECEIVE FROM THE STATE FOR THE I JUST AS PROGRAM. BY 10% ANNUALLY ON AUTOMATICALLY SO LONG AS THERE ISN'T A CONTRACT IN PLACE. THE REASON WHY WE ARE SEEKING THIS PROPOSAL IS BECAUSE WE HAVE NO OTHER LEVERAGE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE. WE NEED YOUR HELP TO HOLD CERTAIN COUNTIES ACCOUNTABLE. OVER FORTY PROVIDERS HAVE WRITTEN INTO THIS COMMITTEE DAY HUNDREDS EXPRESSING SUPPORT. A PROVIDERS ARE PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN OF COLOR J. MINIMUM WAGE FOR JUST ABOUT MIDDLE WAYS FOR HELPING OVER HALF A MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVE AT HOME AND COMFORT AND DIGNITY. WAGES HAVE GONE UP BECAUSE OF THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE SCHEDULE AND THERE'S STILL A FRACTION OF THE ACTUAL LIVING. THING WHICH WAS COUNTIES TO OFFER HEALTH BENEFITS PAID TIME OFF RETIREMENT BENEFITS PROVIDERS ONLY QUALIFY FOR THE ANNUAL PAY SICK LEAVE BENEFIT OF TWO DAYS AND THANKFULLY TEMPORARY PANDEMIC PROVISIONS. ARMADA'S PROPOSALS ARE TREATED INAPPROPRIATELY IN SOME COUNTIES WITH LACK OF SERIOUS ENGAGEMENT. WE RECOGNIZE THAT BY AND LARGE COUNTIES ARE HONEST BROKERS AND BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH WITH US AND HE'S CON. AND CONTRACTS. AT THIS POINT THERE ARE ONLY THREE COUNTIES OF OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT THEY'RE GOING TO FACT FINDING IN OUR MEDIATION THIS IS LASSEN CURRENT VIEW AGAIN. AND WHICH WE WOULD CONSIDER USING THIS TOOL AND THIS TOOL WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER COUNTY FOR COUNTIES IT IS TRULY A LAST RESORT AFTER LENGTHY NEGOTIATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE BE COUNTY THAT'S HAD A CONTRACT EXPIRED OVER SIX AND A HALF YEARS. HASN'T EVEN MOVED TO THE FACT FINDING PROCESS YET. IN ORDER FOR THE PENALTY MOVED FOR. WARD AFTER DECLARING IMPASSE MEDIATION FACT FINDING THE FACT FINDER WHO IS THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE TO ROLL NAY YES FAVOR AND RESULTS ARE NON BINDING. THE COUNTY ALSO AT LEAST HAS NINETY DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FAX FACT FINDING- RECOMMENDATIONS TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNION. AND EVEN AFTER THE UNION FILES FOR THE PALI WITH CURB THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL APPEALS PROCESS FOR THE COUNTY TO JUSTIFY THEIR CLAIMS BEFORE PER MAKES A DETERMINATION. WE BELIEVE A 10% FISCAL POLICY SHOULD BE A REASONABLE TOOL WITH DUE PROCESS THAT WOULD HELP ENCOURAGE A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF COUNTIES WERE BARGAINING IS PROVING TO BE DIFFICULT TO MOVE NEGOTIATIONS FORWARD. I WANT CLOSE BY SAYING THAT I JUST PROVIDERS ARE FRONTLINE. FOR TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE WAGE INEQUITIES THE CHALLENGES RECRUITMENT RETENTION OF THIS WORKFORCE AND CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR SUBPOENAS TO THIS PROPOSAL TAKES STEPS TOWARDS THE MASTER PLAN CALLS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND WE WILL NOW MOVE TO TIFFANY WHITEN SENIOR GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ADVOCATE WITH SEIU. ANY RIGHT BUT THAT'S THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF SEIU LOCAL TWENTY FIFTEEN CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST LONG TERM CARE UNION REPRESENTING OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND NURSING HOME WORKERS PRIVATE AGENCY AND I'D JUST AS WORKERS I WILL BE RESPONDING TO THREE QUESTION TODAY. FIRST WHAT ARE THE CRITICAL WORKFORCE NEEDS FOR AGES SAYS AND WHAT WOULD IMPROVE THE SITUATION FOR THE PROGRAM EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED WORK FOR SHORTAGES AND HOME CARE COVER OVER THE COMING YEARS UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AGES THAT'S WORK WORK FORCE AND THE NEED TO ALLEVIATE AND LEVERAGE THEIR ROLE IN HELPING TO KEEP CONSUMERS SAFE IN THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES. DON'T GROWING AGING POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA MAKES HOME CARE ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING OCCUPATIONS IN THE STATE WITH PROJECTED GROWTH OF 32% BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT ACCORDING TO EIGHTY DELAYED MARKET STATISTICS I JUST AS WORKERS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN BALANCING A HISTORIC INSTITUTIONAL BIAS AND HELPING CONSUMERS REMAIN IN THEIR PREFERRED SETTING. BUT THIS JOB BUT THERE'S JOB PRINCE PRESCRIPTIONS WITH IN HOME CARE AND I IT JUST SAYS ARE CHALLENGING TO ADDRESS GROWING DEMAND ALONGSIDE. RESTRAINTS APPLY IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT BACK OF RETURN THREE OPPORTUNITY AND RETIRED SECURITY. I THE AUDIT HIGHLIGHTS. LIVING WAGE ARE NOT PROVIDED IN THE PROBE. WITH ALMOST ALL COUNTY AFTER THEM WAGE. THE MULTIPLY EFFECT I THINK WAGE FOR THIS IS. LOW INCOME. IS A STEP. RETIREMENTS IS OUT OF REACH FOR MANY I. PROVIDERS PER. THE MAY PARA AND SPOUSE. WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL. WHICH IS ALSO NOT AN ADEQUATE SOURCE OF RETIREMENT INCOME ON ITS OWN. THERE'S NO CAREER LADDER AND LIMITED TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN AYE HE JUST SAYS AND I JUST SAYS PROVIDERS MUST LOOK OUTSIDE OF HOME CARE IF THEY WANT CAREER ADVANCEMENT. ONLY SERVING TO REINFORCE THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE. TRAINING HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON CONSUMER AND PROVIDER STATUS THE SATISFACTION AND CREATING CAREER PATHWAYS CAN HELP WITH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. TRAINING HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE CONSUMERS HEALTH OUTCOMES AND UTILIZATION RATES BENEFITS THAT HAVE BROADER COST SAVING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE COSTS. THESE TYPE OF INVESTMENTS WITH STABILIZE THE WORKFORCE AND IMPROVE CARE DELIVERY AND HAVE FAR REACHING IMPACTS ON THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND SOCIAL SAFETY NET- THE SECOND. WHAT WERE THE COME. OF OUR REDUCTIONS THAT OCCURRED AS PART OF PAST BUDGET DEALS AND WHAT ARE THE LESSONS WELL REDUCTIONS IN HOURS IN PREVIOUS BUDGETS HAVE HAD DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON ARE YOU JUST AS CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS. CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS HAVE TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE DECISIONS ON WHICH SERVICES TO CUT SERVICES THAT WERE FUNDAMENTAL TO BEING ABLE TO REMAIN SAFELY IN THEIR HOMES SUCH AS BATHING PARAMEDICAL SERVICES LAUNDRY AND HOUSE CLEANING. WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY PROVIDERS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THE SAME AMOUNT OF HOURS EVEN AFTER CUTS WERE INSTITUTED. IS CENTRALLY MOVING THE WORK UNDERGROUND SO IT WENT UNRECOGNIZED. AND UNPAID TO CARE FOR THEIR CONSUMER. AND I AM JUST SO DUMB THE OF HOURS IS TO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE THE PROGRAM DOES NOT PAY FOR TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE SO IF THE PROVIDER IS TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE WITH DEMENTIA OR SOMEONE WHO NEEDS PROTECTIVE SUPERVISION. BUT THEY ARE OFTEN PROVIDING MANY HOURS OF CARE THAT ARE THAT ALREADY GO UNPAID SO WE HAVE LEARNED THAT REDUCTIONS IN HOURS JUST AS LOW WAGE WORKERS TO DO MORE WITH LESS. AND PUSHES THEM FURTHER INTO POVERTY BY THE CONSUMER GOES POTENTIALLY WITHOUT VITAL SERVICES. PASS REDUCTIONS HAVE FORCED SOME PROVIDERS TO LEAVE THE WORK FORCE. ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTING TO THE WORKER SHORTAGE ISSUE EVEN MORE WELL WE APPRECIATE THE EXTENSION OF THE 7% SUSPENSION AND THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED BUDGET TODAY A AMOUNTS TO OVER FIVE MILLION HOURS PER MONTH. THAT WILL GO UNMET FOR CONSUMERS AND I'M PAID TO THIS LOW WAGE WORKFORCE THERE ARE OVER FIFTY SIX ORGANIZATIONS ASKING FOR A REMOVER OF THE SUSPENSION DATE AND A PERMANENT RESTORATION. OF THE SEPARATE FOR THINK CUT. SO THE- LESSONS LEARN FROM K. IS A SPEECH NOT BALANCE ITS BUDGE. ON THE BACKS OF WAGE WORKERS AND DOUBLES PARTNER. TO HANG THIS CUT- OVER WELCOME. AND PROVIDERS THE OUT YEARS SIMPLY BROUGHT THANK. I'M AN UNACCEPTABLE. THIRD AND LAST WEEK HOW DOES OR SHOULD AGES AS AS A PROGRAM IT INTO THE THINKING AROUND- THE MASTER PLAN. I DO JUST AS IS THE STATE'S CORNERSTONE LTSS PROGRAM FUNDING STABILITY FOR THE PROGRAM THAT PROMOTES PRO- FUNDING STABILITY FOR THE PROGRAM THAT PROMOTES PROGRAM PROGRAMMATIC THE BILL- SUSTAINABILITY IS VITAL ONE OF THE FIVE BOLD GOALS OF THE NPA IS TO CREATE CARE GIVING THAT WORKS. WITH THE TARGET OF CREATING ONE MILLION HIGH QUALITY DIRA CARE JOBS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. REACHING THAT TARGET WILL BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT FOCUSING ON THE AGES AS WORKFORCE A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE AGES THAT'S WORKFORCE ARE WOMEN OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANTS. IF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ARE IN FACT COMMITTED TO PROVIDING LTSS TO CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE. THROUGH A LENS OF EQUITY IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE AGES AS WORKFORCE BE PAID LIVABLE WAGES WITH BENEFITS AND SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. THE STATE OWES IT NOT ONLY TO THE PROVIDERS OF THE SERVICE BUT ALSO THOSE RECEIVING THE CARE AS WELL. HISTORICALLY I HSS HAS BEEN CARVED OUT OF FEDERAL AND STATE BENEFITS THAT OTHER WORKERS RECEIVE EXAMPLES INCLUDES SICK LEAVE AND OVERTIME. CALIFORNIANS CANNOT REIMAGINE AGING AND OUR STATE OVER THE NEXT DECADE WITHOUT INCLUDING AYE AGES AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION. AS THE CABINET LEVEL WORKGROUP CONCLUDED IN THE FINAL IN PA. THE CARE GIVING WORK FORCE. CAN BE GROWN THROUGH CHARACTER TRAY. AND PROFESSIONAL THE- I. ALONG WITH LIVABLE BY. JOB PLACE SUPPLY AND IMPROVE JOB. HI WAGES WILL HELP PAY CARE GIVERS WORK TOWARD FINANCIAL. ALLEVIATE ECONOMIC DISPARITIES AND BETTER REFLECT THE VALUE OF THEIR WORK THIS INCLUDES THE AGES THAT'S WORKFORCE I'M THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO ME TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JUSTIN GARRETT LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. THANK YOU I CHAIRED MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE TODAY MY NAME'S JUSTIN KERR I'M THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK TO ACT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUT JUST WANT TO QUICKLY- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE BROAD SCOPE OF THIS PANEL ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING JUST WANT TO. SHARE THE COUNTY THEY'RE FULLY COMMITTED TO PARTNERING WITH ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE ALIMENTATION AND EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY. I MOVING TO THE FOR QUESTION I THE- FOR COUNTY JUST QUIT BARGAIN. THE MINISTER AND LET. INDICATING YEARS STRONG. IN AN INCREASED NUMBER OF COLLECTIVE. AGREEMENTS I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THE COUNTY JUST THERE IS SICK. INTO CROP. AND REACH COLLECTED BY AGREEMENT TO INCREASE WAGES IN BENEFITS FOR I JUST PROVIDERS. FORTY SIX COUNTIES COVERING MORE THAN 95% OF THE ACTORS PROVIDE WORKFORCE. I PERSONALLY INCREASE WEIGHT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND INVESTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COUNTY FUNDING FOR WAGE INCREASES. THAT'S PROGRESS STARTING WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TOOLS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. I'M XCELERATED BY THE LOWERED COUNTY I SEVEN MILLION TWENTY NINETEEN WITH TWENTY SIX COUNTY REGION AGREEMENT. THAT EMILY WAS AN ACTIVE. AS SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE STORE PAYS FOR NEW. FOR THOSE TWELVE REMAINING. WE ARE CURRENTLY TO GO. SIX ARE WAITING FOR THE NEED TO. COUNTY OR- TO REACH AND ONLY THREE HAVE GONE TO FACT FINE OR ME. THANK QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT THAT'S MAY. THERE'S OF THEM HAVE LED THE THINK NUMBER AGREEMENTS. AFTER HE DOES. SHARING RATIO WITH A COW PAYS FIVE. IN THE STATE 60% OF THE NON SHARE COSTS FOR LOCAL AGE CREASES TO THE STATE INSPECTION CAP. SECOND IS THE SUPPLEMENT TO WHICH WAS QUITE SEVENTEEN AND ALLOWS COUNTIES INCREASE. AND HOW A PERMIT FLOAT. ABOVE THE- IN STATEMENT WAGE. AND TO. PAY IN TWENTY. IS KNOWN AS- 10% OF THREE YEARS TOOL AND ALLOWS THE COUNTY TO. STATE ABOVE THE A. K. OF THE CAP WITH A DEFINED AMOUNT OF PERCENT OF THE COUNT TOTAL DOESN'T BENEFITS. SO ALL CAN THAT HAVING WAY TO TWENTY. IF UTILIZED THE WEIGHT THE- TO. AND HAS BEEN FIFTH COUNTY THAT IT HAD. THE CAP AND THE NEEDED THE TEMP. OF THREE YEARS TO ON. I THE LAST QUESTION OF THE UP TO CHANGES IN OUR- AS- NOTED BY. YOU NEEDED UP ON JAN. FIRST TWENTY TWO TWO. AT TWO OF THE SUN MEXICAN MACINNES. ARE GOING CHANGE A WAY THAT WILL IT MORE. TO REACH AGREE. AS AND HOW SHARING. WILL AND COUNTIES ARE. WITH TO BE AND AT THE YOU. ON THE CALL BUDGET PROPOSAL THE WOULD INSTEAD KEEP THE CURRENT. STATE COUNTY SHARE RATIO. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF OUR JOINT. IS TO ALL MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURE. OVER TO YEARS TO ALL. I WANT TO THANK. MEMBER THE HOUSE HIS LEADER. ON THIS BUDGET AT. THE CURRENT LAW COUNTY MUST. EIGHT YEAR PERIOD BY. FOR TWENTY TWO IS LIMITED TO YOU OF THIS TOOL. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO COUNT THERE ABOVE OR NEAR THE- POTENTIALLY. TO AND THEN NEGOCIE. WE PROPOSE THAT THE BEST B. X. BE. GENDER FIRST TWO TWENTY. AND A COUNTY WILL BE ABLE TO YOU THAT TO. THAN TWO. WITHOUT THE- OF THE SPA MAKING. PRAGUE AND I THAT'S CLICK TO BARGAINING LIKELY JUST. ASK COSTS RELATING. WERE NEARLY. I WOULD NO LONGER BE SUSTAIN. AND BECAUSE THE GOAL OF A FIVE THAT CAN. I IN TWENTY NINE. AT THIS ALSO THAT IMPACTS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS WILL REALIZE. CODING PUBLIC HEALTH AND- HEALTH. CAN INCREASE WAGES EVEN DURING TIMES WHEN THE EMILY BUT NOTHING A BILL. WHEN THERE WAS NO PENALTY PROVISION IN PLACE AND DURING THE PANDEMIC INDUCE RECESSION. BUT DESPITE ALL THE PROGRESS ON COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THERE IS NOW A NEW PENALTY PROPOSAL. THAT IS TEN TIMES GREATER THAN WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO. ALL COUNTY THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW CONTINUE NEGOTIATING GOOD FAITH. WITH LOCAL PROVIDER UNION EVEN THOUGH COUNTY THAT HAVE NOT YET REACHED AGREEMENT. ALL THE FROM UW'S WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE OF REPRESENT THE STATE DICTATING THE OUTCOME OF LOCAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSE. IN THE STATE'S INTERNIST INTERESTED IN MANDATING A HIGHER WAGE FOR ALL LICENSED PROVIDERS. THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. THIS INCLUDES THE STATE ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING OR PROVIDING DEDICATED STATE REVENUES FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. BOTH IDEAS AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BROUGHT UP PREVIOUSLY IN. THE WAY TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT FUTURE GREEN BUSINESS TO ADOPT THE COALITION BUDGET PROPOSAL. TO PROVIDE A POSITIVE FISCAL INCENTIVE RATHER THAN A PUNITIVE APPROACH. ADOPTION OF I DON'T BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL SUSTAIN THE STATE'S COMMITMENT AND CONTINUE THE CURRENT FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT ARE NEEDED. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE FURTHER PROGRESS RIGHTS OF COLLECTIVE. BARGAINING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FOR KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH CWDM. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. HELLO FIVE FIVE KATHY SAID KNOWING THE BATTLE WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THIS PANEL. FIRST WE APPLAUD THE WORK OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND ESPECIALLY DIRECTOR MCCOY WAITED PARTICULAR FOR THEIR WORK ON THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING WHICH ARTICULATED A COMPREHENSIVE AND THOUGHTFUL PLAN TO STRENGTHEN SERVICES TO OLDER ADULTS INCLUDING ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES. MEETING WITH A IN THIS AND EMBRACE THE RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE PLAN INCLUDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE SAMPLED SEPARATELY ADDRESSED BY THE L. T. S. S. TASK FORCE. NOT ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA. FIRST OF ALL RELATED TO THE EXPERIENCE OF IMPLEMENTING HOME SAY. HOME SAFE AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AS A PART OF THE OVERALL ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM AND WAS INITIALLY CREATED AS A THREE YEAR PILOT OPERATING IN A SUBSET OF COUNTY. THE PROGRAM A THREE EXPIRES AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. WE'RE PROPOSING TO MAKE IT PERMANENT AS WELL AS EXPAND FUNDING TO ENABLE MORE COUNTIES TO JOIN IN THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. THROUGH A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION. IT WAS BORN OUT OF A GROWING HOUSING CRISIS AMONG OUR OLDER POPULATION. RESEARCH BY MARCUS STYLE AND UC SAN FRANCISCO DEMONSTRATES THAT THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS THE OLDER POPULATION. AND MOST OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS BECOME HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER AGE FIFTY IT'S NOT CHRONIC. WE ALSO KNOW THAT FINDING AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING AS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. BECAUSE OF THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR SERVICES AND HOME STATE HAS BEEN TO SUPPORT CLIENTS HIS HOUSING IS AT RISK. RATHER THAN THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY HOMELESS PREVENTION IS KEY. HOME IS AN INTERESTING STORY. RENDON FACTION OVER CHEAPER TWO HUNDRED OLDER DEPEND ADULTS ACROSS TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES HAVE RECEIVED HELP AND SUPPORT AND OTHER SERVICES TO THE HOME SAFE PILOT. AND IT'S BEEN WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT AND WE URGE THAT IT BE CONTINUE. WE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF CLIENTS STORIES FROM INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES THAT WE WILL SHARE WITH THE SUB COMMITTEE STAFF AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS. SOME COMMON THEMES OF THESE AND OTHER STORIES. THESE ARE VULNERABLE OLDER ADULTS MANY LIVING IN POVERTY ON FIXED INCOMES WERE FACING CHALLENGES OF CHRONIC OR SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES. MENTAL ILLNESS AND ISOLATION SUCH AS THE DEATH OF RELATIVES. LIVING IN PROPERTIES THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO DISREPAIR AND ARE BEING EITHER TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OR HARASSED SOMETIMES BY THEIR LANDLORDS OR THEIR OWN FAMILY. IN FRESNO FOR EXAMPLE A CLIENT WAS LIVING IN A TRAVEL BAN IN THE MOUNTAINS OUTSIDE OF THE HOME SHE AND HER HUSBAND BUILT TOGETHER. PASSED AWAY BEFORE THEY CAN MOVE IN AND RETIRE. IT TURNED OUT WHEN WE WILL LOOK INTO THE SITUATION THAT OUR CLIENT WAS ALSO A HOARDER. THROUGH THE USE OF HOME SAFE RESOURCES ARE COUNTY WAS ABLE TO GO AND CLEAN OUT THE HOME AND REPAIR THE ROOF. AND IN THE PROCESS OF ALL OF THAT OUR STAFF FOUND THE QUIET WEDDING RING THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN LOST. SO NOT ONLY TO THE CLIENT MOVE BACK INTO THE HOME SHE ALSO MOVED IN WITH HER LONG LOST WEDDING RING. FURTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN- STRENGTHENS THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE DID NOT TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. THE KEY AREAS FOR STRENGTHENING APRS FOR HER PROGRAM AND POLICY EXPERTS PERSPECTIVE IS TO ENSURE WE CAN PROVIDE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF CASE MANAGEMENT. TO HELP THOSE IN NEED OF THE DEPRESSED AND SERVICES AND TO ENSURE A STEADY FUNDING SOURCE THAT WILL HELP US KEEP UP WITH GROWING DEMAND. WITH REGARD TO SERVICES THE CASE MANAGEMENT. HISTORICALLY THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ROUTED IN SHORT TERM INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT. PROGRAM WAS NEVER FULLY FUNDED FOR ESTIMATES OF NEED MADE IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN THE AUTHORIZING STATUTE WAS ENACTED. AND SO A SYSTEM THAT OPEN AND CLOSE CASES WITHIN A RELATIVELY QUICK PERIOD OF TIME HAS BEEN THE NORM. IN FACT TIME OUR OLDER POPULATION HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY ALONG WITH OUR POPULATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS DISABILITIES WITH THE FACILITIES YOU MAY BE VULNERABLE TO ABUSE NEGLECT. ALONG WITH COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED AT ALL. MANY MORE OF THESE ADULTS ARE ALSO FACING HOUSING CRISES AS YOU KNOW IN ADDITION ISOLATION AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC WALKED DOWN. RACE GENDER AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY AND EQUITIES ALSO PROCESS FOR MANY OF OUR OLDER ADULTS. AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES AS THEY NAVIGATE SYSTEMS OF CARE AND SERVICES THAT ARE OFTEN ARE LACKING IN SUPPORT TO BEGIN WITH. WITH REGARD TO INCREASE THE NEED AND THE FUNDING TO MEET THAT NEED WE'RE ALREADY SEEING A GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM. IN JUST TEN YEARS SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN TWELVE COUNTY APS PROGRAMS A FEW REPORTS OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT INCREASED BY SIXTY ONE POINT 3% FOR REFERENCE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT REVENUES TO THE PROTECTIVE SERVICES FROM A CATHOLIC COUNTY. WHICH INCLUDES FUNDING FOR A PS. I'VE ONLY GROWN BY FORTY FIVE POINT SIX PERCENT. IN THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME. THERE IS NO ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING AT THE STATE OR FEDERAL LEVEL. OTHER THAN A ONE TIME ACTUALLY IT'S NOW BECOME A TWO TIME NINE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND ACTED AS PART OF THE TWO MOST RECENT RELIEF PACKAGES. AND THESE REPRESENTS THE FIRST TIME THAT FEDERAL MONEY HAS EVER COME INTO THIS PROGRAM OTHER THAN THE OCCASIONAL ABILITY TO MATCH OUR MEDICAID FUNDING FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. ARE PROPOSAL WOULD ALLW FOR A PS TO SERVE OLDER ADULTS EARLIER AT AGE SIXTY INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT SIXTY FIVE CONSISTENT WITH OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAM. IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE LONG TERM CASE MANAGEMENT TO RECIPIENTS OF GREATER NEEDS. AND WE WOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO HONE IN ON OLDER ADULTS INDEPENDENT ADULTS AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. BY EXTENDING HOME SAFE. INCLUDING THE THIRTY MILLION NOTED EARLIER FOR HOMESTAY. THE TOTAL OUR CLASSES ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND I'M GOING. OUR CORRESPONDENTS INCLUDE EXPERTS IN OLDER JUSTICE COUNTY PARTNERS AND LABOR INCLUDING JUSTICE IN AGING THE CALIFORNIA ELDER JUSTICE COALITION AT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA. THE FACT URBAN COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS PUBLIC GUARDIANS AND PUBLIC CONSERVATIVE. IF WE DON'T ADEQUATELY FUNDED YET THE GROWING POPULATION WILL QUICKLY OUTPACED OUR CAPACITY TO SERVE. A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF OLDER ADULTS AT RISK OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT WON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED AND CHANCES ARE THEY WILL END UP TOUCHING OTHER SYSTEMS WHEN THINGS BECOME MORE DIRE. SUCH AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND FINALLY WITH REGARD APR OF THE MASTER PLAN AN AGING POINTS OUT. ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO FULL INCLUSION AND EQUITY FOR ALL AGES. OLDER ABUSE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE THE INVESTMENT OUR COALITION OF ASKING FOR IT. IS NOT VERY REASONABLE AN EXTREMELY CRITICAL FOR INCLUSION AND EQUITY. HELLO I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING- WHAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY DONE TO EASE ENROLLMENT ACCESS TO ITEMS THAT'S BOTH DURING THE PANDEMIC IN AFTER. AS I DISCUSSED DURING THE PANEL ON RACE AND EQUITY BEING AWARE OF HOW THIS PROGRAM STRUCTURE CREATES INEQUITIES AND BARRIERS TO KERR IS FUNDAMENTAL TO INCREASING ENROLLMENT AND ENHANCING ACCESS. I JUST HOPE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A PROGRAM THAT IS SOLD PRIMARILY AROUND COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REQUIREMENTS THAT PRESENT BARRIERS TO COVERAGE. IN THE SHORT RUN THE QUICKEST AND EASIEST THING WE CAN DO IT SUPPORT CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS TO QUICKLY GET THEIR FORMS RETURNED TO COUNTY THEIR ONLINE PORTALS. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGIES USED FOR ELECTRIC FORMS AND SIGNATURES. THIS SIMPLE STEP WILL INCREASE SAFETY FOR CONSUMERS FOR MAKING MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT PROGRAMS PROSPECT THESE AND WE HAVE A VERY MODEST BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT PROVIDES FUNDING FOR THIS. IN A LONGER TERM GIVEN ONE AN AXE FOR THE ALLEN'S OF FOR I THAT. WE CAN CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS. SOME OF WHICH- ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AGING MASTERPLAN REPORT. REALLY WHAT THIS ENTAILS IS LOOKING AT OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO SEE WHAT'S TRULY NECESSARY FOR EFFECTIVE OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM. AND WHAT COULD BE SHORTENED OR ELIMINATED ALTOGETHER JUST A FEW EXAMPLES INCLUDE. REVIEWING MEDICAL POLICIES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE OLDER ADULT POPULATIONS SUCH AS THE ASSET LIMIT. AND CONSIDER PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR SOME POPULATIONS GENETIC CAL INDOOR I JUST ASK FOR EXAMPLE WHEN BEING DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL FUNDING. REVISING CRIMINAL ABOUT BACKGROUND CHECK POLICIES THAT CAN BE A BARRIER FOR PROVIDERS THE UNDERLYING RACISM CONTRIBUTING TO A GREATER LIKELIHOOD. OF RELATIVELY MINOR CRIMES BY TODAY'S STANDARDS BEING A PROVIDER APPLICANTS HISTORY PARTICULARLY FOR POPULATIONS OF COLOR. ALSO THE STAGE TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO COVER THE COSTS OF CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR POTENTIAL ITEMS THAT'S PROVIDE. AND FINALLY ADEQUATELY FUNDING THE WORKLOAD FOR COUNTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT I JUST ASKED PROGRAM CASELOADS FOR SOCIAL WORKERS REMAIN INCREDIBLY HIGH WHICH REDUCES THE TIME OUR STAFF HAVE TO SUPPORT CONSUMERS AND- HIGHLY ACCESSING SERVICES. AND HAVING THEIR APPLICATIONS PROCESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THE TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CLAIRE RAMSEY SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY WITH JUSTICE IN AGING. YOUR NUMBERS THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY AT THIS MOMENT TO INVEST IN A BOLD EQUITABLE FUTURE FOR OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. MY NAME IS CLEAR RAMSEY AND I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH JUSTICE IN AGING WE ARE NATIONAL LEGAL NONPROFIT THAT USES THE POWER OF LAW TO FIGHT TO YOUR PROPERTY WE WORK TO STRENGTHEN THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET. AND TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS LOW INCOME SENIOR SPACE IN ACCESSING THE SERVICES THEY NEED WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ADVANCING EQUITY. SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I AT JUSTICE IN AGING WE'RE VERY INVOLVED IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. AS WE BEGIN THAT PROCESS IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE KNEW HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO LIFT UP THE ISSUES FACED BY OLDER CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT STATE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES ALONE WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE EQUITABLE THOUGHTFUL EXPANSIVE AND HOLISTIC PLANNING. WHAT WE COULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED OR PREDICTED WITH A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY INFECTED AND KILLED OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE BLACK WHAT NEXT INDIGENOUS AN API COMMUNITIES WOULD RIP TO THE STATE NATION AND WORLD. IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER EVEN THOUGH THEY CONSTITUTE LESS THAN 11% OF CONFIRMED CASES. KOBE NINETEEN CRISIS HAS REVEALED AND EXACERBATED THE SHORTCOMINGS IN CALIFORNIA'S SAFETY NET SYSTEMS FOR ALL POPULATIONS. BUT ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER ADULTS. BUT IT HAS ALSO SHOWN HOW MUCH WE CAN DO AND HOW QUICKLY WE CAN DO IT WHEN WE ACT WITH RESOLVE. CALIFORNIA'S HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT SERVE OLDER ADULTS INCLUDING HSS MSSP APS. AS A SCIENCE IS P. AND SENIOR NUTRITION PROVED HOW VITAL THEY WERE AND ARE TO INSURE IN OLDER ADULTS CAN LIVE SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC. ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE IS REQUIRED THE LEGISLATURE TO HOLD THE LINE AGAINST CUTS TO THESE PROGRAMS LAST YEAR EVEN WHEN CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET SITUATION SEEM DIRE. FINDING THAT POINT AND WINNING WAS INSTRUMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT WE WERE NOT. THERE WERE NOT EVEN MORE DIRE EFFECTS FROM KOGAN. NOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE CHANCE TO EXPAND ITS COMMITMENT TO THESE PROGRAMS. AND TO THE COMMUNITIES THEY SUPPORT. BY FIRST PERMANENTLY RESTORING THE ENACTED SOLELY FOR BUDGETARY REASONS ACROSS THE CLIPBOARD CUTS LIKE THIS ARE BAD POLICY. THE PANDEMIC SHOWED US IN UNMISTAKABLE TERMS THAT PEOPLE NEED ROBUST ACCESS TO HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. I JUST AS IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR EACH CBS SYSTEM AND IT SERVES MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ALMOST 70% OF WHOM ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE ITS COMMITMENT HEDIS CRYSTAL CLEAR BY REPEALING THE TOP PERMANENTLY SO DOES NOT CONTINUE TO HANG OVER I JUST AS RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDERS HEADS. SECOND WE SHOULD EXPAND ACCESS TO ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES AND HOME STATE PROGRAM. APS HAS BEEN CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED BUT WE NOW HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THE COMPLEX AND UNIQUE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MEETING THOSENEEDS. INCREASING FUNDING FOR IT YES IN HOME STATE ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO LOWER HOMELESSNESS IN THE OLDER ADULT COMMUNITY WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS BLACK CALIFORNIANS TO WORK TO ADDRESS THE ENDURING NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF RACISM AND SEXISM. AND EXPANSIVE CORPORATE PEOPLE LIVING WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS. THIRD WE SHOULD INCREASE THE SS I SS P. GRANT UP TO A 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. WE KNOW THAT WOMEN BLACK LATIN ACCENT IMMIGRANT OLDER ADULTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO AGE INTO POVERTY THAN WHITE MEN. CALIFORNIANS WHO RECEIVE SSI S. B. GRANTS HAVE STRUGGLED MORE THAN TEN YEARS TO LIVE IN AN EXPENSIVE STATE UNLESS IN A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP TO SUPPORT THESE CALIFORNIANS IN THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS. BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO RAISE GRANT LEVELS PERMANENTLY AND MOVE MORE THAN ONE POINT TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS OUT OF POVERTY. FINALLY WE SHOULD INVEST MORE IN SENIOR NUTRITION. CALIFORNIA FUNDS AND RUNS A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS TO HELP INSURE OLDER ADULTS HAVE ACCESS TO FOOD BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH. IN FACT CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST UPTAKE RATES OF SNAP BENEFITS IN THE COUNTRY. WE'VE SEEN A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SENIORS EXPERIENCE INCLUDING SECURITY. WE NEED TO INVEST NOW TO ENSURE IT NO OLDER CALIFORNIAN GOES HUNGRY. BY MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS IN THESE CORE HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS AND THE OTHERS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED TODAY WE CAN CHART A NEW PATH TOWARD AN EQUITABLE CALIFORNIA FOR OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE CAN DECIDE THE LOSS OF LIFE AND THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN. WE CAN DECIDE THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO EQUITABLY PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS OF ALL LOW INCOME OLDER CALIFORNIANS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ANDREW SHANE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS. WHO IS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIANS FOR SSI COALITION. THANK YOU TO WONDER WHAT YOUR NUMBERS ARE- I WILL- GIVE MY REMARKS BRIEF I APPRECIATE THAT THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS IMAGE CERTAINLY ALIGNED IN THE COALITION'S WITH THOSE BY THE RAMSEY OF MY CURLED AND OTHERS EARLIER TODAY- I AN INTERCHANGE I AM REPRESENTING COALITION OF MORE THAN. TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS STATEWIDE- WHO DO OUR BEST TO THE ABOUT US WITHOUT US I'M REPRESENTING OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SO I WILL END WITH A SHORT PERSONAL STORY. I'M QUICKLY I WOULD ALSO SIGNAL TO COALITION STRONG SUPPORT FOR DIRECTOR MCQUAY- AND THE POLITICAL IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING OF AFFORDABLE AGING FOR ALL AND. HUNGER AND POVERTY. YOUR RELIGIOUS AND MINISTRY TO ACHIEVE THAT. FIRST OFF THANKS FOR INCLUSION OF SSI RECIPIENTS IN THE RECENT GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS I REQUEST THAT IF THERE ARE ANY FUTURE STIMULUS. PACKAGES AGAIN BUT THOSE TO INCLUDE SSI S. B. RECIPIENTS AS THE COSTS ARE EXTRAORDINARY DUE TO CORPORATE FROM THE DELIVERY OF FOOD AND MEDICINE. PAYING FOR RIDES WITH DIMINISH PUBLIC TRANSIT OR SIMPLY PAYING FOR JOBS IN ORDER FOR OLDER ADULTS TO STAY HOME AND SURVIVE IT'S CLEAR AND HE JUST SPOKE TO INCREDIBLE MORBIDITY. SECOND WE ARE. AGAIN OTHERS ON RAISING ISIS I SS P. GRANTS THE STATE BACK TO TWO THOUSAND NINE THEY'RE LOOKING OVER DO. AS WELL AS EARLIER BY DRUCKER JOHNSON THAT I RAISING ENROLLMENT IN S. I. S. T. WE CAN DRIVE DOWN MILLIONS IN FEDERAL DOLLARS MOVING FOLKS- OFF OF GHG ARE ON TO AS AS I AM GIVING THEM A BRIGHTER FUTURE. SO WE HOPE IN A WAY THAT THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS IS STEP ONE TOWARDS RESTORING THOSE CUTS BECAUSE SS I RECIPIENTS WERE IN CRISIS BEFORE AND ARE TRULY. CRITICAL CONDITION NOW. THIRD FOR SIXTY. AS WELL AS THE VISION TO TRULY HARMLESS. AS A SCIENCE IS B. HOUSEHOLDS WITH THAT ARE CELEBRATED HISTORIC POLICY CHANGE AND CERTAINLY DR ROMULUS WE APPRECIATE YOUR ONGOING LEADERSHIP IN THE SPACE. WE CELEBRATE THE EXPANSION AND THE HARD WORK IDEA S. S. C. WGA AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS SEVERAL OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS TO EXECUTE THAT- BUT HOUSEHOLDS. IT NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS AS WE HEARD EARLIER OFTENTIMES CALIBRATION IS NOT ENOUGH- AND IT STILL HASN'T REACHED OUT ALL AS A SAY AS PURE CIVILIANS. SPECIFICALLY FOR THE HOLD HARMLESS PROGRAMS WE MUST YOU TWO THINGS THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO STAND SURE IN THIS PROGRAM I APPRECIATE THE EARLIER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT CHURN AND EXITS. IN PARTICULAR FOR THIS PROGRAM THERE IS NO WAY TO COME BACK DUE TO THE UNFORTUNATE STRUCTURE OF THE TNB PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR- WHERE'S COMPARABLE COST CALFRESH HOUSEHOLDS OFTEN HAVE TWO TO THREE YEAR CERTIFICATION PERIODS AND NINETY DAYS TO RETURN TO THE PROGRAM- THERE IS A SIX MONTH CERTIFICATION PERIOD. AND ONLY A THIRTY DAY CUT OFF WHICH LEADS TO A LIFETIME BAR IF THOSE CONDITIONS ARE MET AND I THINK WE'VE ALL DISCUSSED TODAY THAT EVEN SIMPLE PAPERWORK CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER INCLUDING DURING THE PANDEMIC. SO WE BOTH CALL A TEMPORARY FIX IN ORDER TO PAUSE- SORT OF RECERTIFICATION AND ENSURE THAT ALL CAN BE HOUSEHOLDS CAN- MAYBE IN TEN ELIGIBILITY AS WELL AS PROVIDE SOME VERY CLEAR COMMONSENSE PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS. EXTENDED CERTIFICATION PERIODS LENGTHENING THE NUMBER OF DAYS THAT FOLKS HAVE TO COME BACK AGAIN FOR FILLED THAT COMPARABILITY WITH WITH CALFRESH. SECOND TO REPLACE BENEFITS DURING DISASTER WHEN I HOUSEHOLDS IN THOSE WHO BENEFITS MOST IF SOMEONE LOSES THEIR POWER FOR MORE THAN FOUR HOURS OR IF THERE IS A MOVE FASTER- BLACKOUT OR PS PS EVENT THERE ARE PROVISIONS REPLACE CALFRESH BENEFITS BUT NOT FOR THE S. N. B. N. T. N. B. BENEFITS ARE MEANT TO HOLD THOSE HOUSEHOLDS. HARMLESS AGAIN- SINCE THIS ARE PRETTY SEAMLESS AND STRAIGHTFORWARD FIXES THERE AND WE APPRECIATE THE INPUT BY THE. COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS AND THE DEPARTMENT ON THAT. SO I JUST WITH A FEW COMMENTS- A NECESSARY CAN SITUATE FROM THE DISK. BECAUSE REPORTS THE HER EX. LIVING ON US. IS VERY TO. I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THE WORLD WE WANT TO BE IN A SOCITY BECAUSE OF THE TASK OF JUST SURVIVING EVERY DAY. FOR A LOT OF US JUST THE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO GO ON A SITE RAISES A LOT OF ANXIETY BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO LIVE ON. WITH ITS RISING THE COST OF FOOD RISING NOT TO MENTION MEDICATION YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT DECISION I MUST WHAT YOU NEED. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY RENTS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. BUT IF YOU DONATE THEN YOU'RE NOT GONNA SURVIVE INTO A PLACE TO LIVE IF YOU CHOOSE YOUR FOOD OVER MEDICATION YOU PUT YOUR LIFE AT RISK. THERE ARE MANY OF US TO TRY TO SURVIVE DDNS ASIDE. WE BEG LANDLORDS TO BACK OFF RENT WE GO TO MULTIPLE FOOD BANKS BECAUSE JUST ONE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH FOOD. WE CENTER PHARMACY LINES TODAY WHICH MEDICATION I PICK UP. AND DURING THE PANDEMIC BEING THAT OUR SOCIETY HAS BEEN A LOT HARDER THAN BEFORE. WITH STORE SHOOTING DOWN ALL OVER AMERICA PEOPLE ORDERING EVERYTHING ONLINE BUT THEY FORGET ABOUT THE PEOPLE UNNECESSARY WHO BARELY HAVE ENOUGH TO LIVE. THANK YOU AGAIN SURE FOR EUROPE AND THEN IN THE SPACE. AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU. NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM. KEMPF EXECUTIVE. OF THE SENIORS COUNCIL. OF SANTA CRUZ AND SAN BENITO COUNTIES. WHO IS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. HI THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE AND SO MANY OF MY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS GREAT COMMENTS ARE THE FIRST OF MY FOUR QUESTIONS ASKS ABOUT QUARTER SERVICES DIDN'T THERE'S ANYTHING PARTICULAR THAT NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED TO OUR MASTER PLAN FOR AGING TO SUCCEED. AND I'LL JUST CALL OUT THAT OVER THE PAST DECADE ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE SIXTY PLUS POPULATION IN THE STATE HAS GROWN BY 40% WHILE THE UNDER SIXTY POPULATION HAS GROWN BY LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. SO I THINK THAT GROW. ALONE POINTS OUT THE NEED TO- LEFT OUT ALL PROGRAMS REGARDING AGING THAT THERE'S JUST A HUGE DEMAND THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT QUITE A BIT I'M ALL CALL OUT A COUPLE OF THEM. ONE IS JUST- AREA AGENCIES ON AGING WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DELIVERY OF A LOT OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES ARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE- OUR BASELINE FUNDING IS THE SAME AS IT WAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY OR EIGHTY ONE. FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR ON THAT NOW BUYS ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF SERVICES THE STATE HAS CURRENTLY MADE NO INVESTMENT IN- TRIP AWAY BASED ON FUNDING SO THAT'S ONE OF THE FUNDING REQUEST THAT WE'RE ASKING THAT THERE BE SOME SORT OF MINIMUM CONTRIBUTION AND WE THINK OF TRIPLE A.'S- WHO ARE INTEGRAL TO. THE PROVIDING OUR SERVICES TO VULNERABLE THE ADULTS IF WE'RE GOING TO EXCEED AND ARE SERVING THIS POPULATION IN IN MASTER PLANNED FOR AGING GOALS THAT PART OF THAT IS TO HAVE AT LEAST SOME. RESOURCES IN ORDER TO DO SO. ONE OF THE THINGS FOUND DURING THE PANDEMIC WAS THAT THE STATE BASELINE FUNDING WHICH UNTIL THIS PAST YEAR WAS ACTUALLY REDUCED FOR OLDER CALIFORNIANS AFTER THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS ACTUALLY ELIMINATED FOR OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT- DAD LEFT THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. AND SERVICES WITH REALLY POOR INFRASTRUCTURES TO MOVE FORWARD I TRYING THE INCREASED MEDIA ACCOUNTS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATE WHEN WE WERE OPERATING ON. I FACILITIES THAT HAD NOT BEEN UPGRADED OR EXPANDED FOR SEVERAL DECADES REALLY I BROUGHT TO THE FORE ARM FOR FRONT THAT THERE WAS JUST A HUGE NEED I REALLY COST BY NICK LACKS. SURROUND ITEMS SUCH AS NUTRITION AND OTHER SERVICES I REALLY THINK THAT PART OF RESPONDING TO THE NEXT PANDEMIC OR JUST TO THE GROWTH OF THE POPULATION IS GOING TO REQUIRE SOME OF THESE. CORE SERVICES TO BE INTERESTED IN BOOK THAT I'M MORE SERIOUSLY AND SPEAKING COURSE SERVICES YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE OUR FAVORITES YOU KNOW. I MENTION- AGENCIES ON A SO WE COULD GO THROUGH THE BUT REALLY MASS. AND I THINK WHAT MASTER PLAN FOR AGING- COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF WHICH I WAS ONE I RECOGNIZE IS THAT. PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE PROVIDE THE BASIC NECESSITIES OF LIFE THAT WE LOOK AT WAYS TO MAKE SURE SENIORS HAVE SHELTER. TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE FOOD AND TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND ACCESS CAN BE INTERPRETED A NUMBER OF WAYS. INCLUDES ESSENTIAL TRANSPORTATION THAT ALSO INCLUDES METHODS BY WHICH TO GET INFORMATION OR TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES BECAUSE THAT'S OUR PART OF. LIFE SUSTAINING PROGRAMS WITHOUT GOALS ANY OTHER INTERVENTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO ATTEMPT IS GOING TO FAIL IT'S DOOMED TO FAIL. NAVIGATION OF OUR COMPLEX SYSTEM IN MULTIPLE FUNDERS IS A HUGE CHALLENGE THAT OLDER ADULTS FACE ARM ON ONE HAND HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT THERE CONTINUE TO BE MULTIPLE FOUNDERS WE WANT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS TO BE INVESTED IN OLDER ADULTS WE WANT VETERANS SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THE OLDER VETERANS GET SIR. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE FOR OLDER ADULTS ADEQUATE FOOD PROGRAMS THAT THAT AT SANDRA SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LENGTHY AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF THESE UNFORTUNATELY SILO PROGRAMS REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO. THE PROGRESS WE CAN REALLY MAKE THAT I THINK WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT IS ADDING AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE WITHIN EACH OF THOSE SILOS SO WE DON'T CREATE THESE FALSE BARRIERS TO SERVICE BECAUSE OF SOME REGULATIONS. AND THE WAY WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS IS ANOTHER PART OF THE BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT I'VE SEEN FOR A IS PROMOTING- DIRECTOR WADE WERE REFERENCED ONE OF THIS AND IT'S HIGHLIGHTED IN MASTER PLAN. AND THAT IS THE CREATION OF A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CAN ACTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PERSON CENTERED SYSTEMS OF NAVIGATION THAT WE HAVE SOMEBODY TO HELP A PERSON WHO NEEDS HELP GET THAT HELP. AND FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF THE PERSON RATHER THAN THE NEEDS ARE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM. SO HAVING THAT SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY I THINK IT'S PART OF OUR RECOMMENDATION AND SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT. I'M GONNA SKIP TO MY LAST QUESTION AND THEN COME BACK BRIEFLY TO THE THIRD ONE WHICH IS SHOULD WE FIND TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS FOR SHOULD BE FINED- INNOVATIONS. AND THE ANSWER IS KIND OF OBVIOUS WE WANT TO DO BOTH WE WANT TO FUND PROGRAMS THAT WORK AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE FOUNDED AND NOW SO. THAT THEY CAN WORK BUT ALL ALSO LOOK AT. KIND OF SIMPLE THAT WE CAN PUT INTO. LONG FRUIT THE WERE PART IS FALSE PREVENT. A SINGLE FALL ON WITH A BROKEN HIP WILL TYPICALLY COST A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN OUR MEDICAL COSTS AND PERSONAL CLASS NOT TO MENTION THE LOSS OF RESOURCES FROM FAMILY MEMBERS. HAVE TO STEP UP AS CARE GIVERS OR THE EMOTIONAL LOSS FLOOR ON THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THIS EMOTIONAL SUFFERING. SO THAT'S ONE PROPOSAL WE WANT TO LOOK FORWARD RIGHT NOW WE THINK THAT IT IS WELL WITH MASTER PLAN FOR REACHING. ARM IN REVISITING HEALTHCARE. AND THEN LET HOW DO WE AFFORD ALL THIS BECAUSE NONE OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE FREE. HOW MAY MAY BE CHEAP BUT THEY'RE NOT FREE SO I THINK THERE'S TWO PIECES ABOUT THE FIRST ONE IS THAT WE LOOK AT HOW MUCH IT WILL COST US. TO CONTINUE THE SERVICES THAT ARE ARE MANDATED TO BE PROVIDED. AS THE POPULATION AGES AND WE COULD JUST DO SOME SIMPLE MATH AROUND THAT AND CALCULATE HOW MANY ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED AS THE POPULATION. DOUBLES ON AND THEN LOOK AT WHAT THAT NUMBER IS AND REALLY PLAN AROUND WHAT'S THE BEST USE OF THOSE DOLLARS IT IS A TO CONTINUE AS WE'RE DOING NOW. OR THERE'S SOME INNOVATIONS OUT THERE THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT WHICH WOULD IMPROVE BOTH QUALITY OF LIFE AND- DECREASE THE COSTS. IN THAT CAN LEADS TO MY FINAL COMMENT THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE ASKING IS NOT JUST WHAT'S THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICE. BUT WHAT'S THE COST OF NOT PROVIDING SERVICE WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING. AND HI. FAR WILL CLASS ESCALATES ON BOTH THE FINANCIAL SIDE OF THINGS BUT ALSO THE HUMAN. ASPECTS SO THAT WRAPS UP MY TIME- I DO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMAN ADRIAN IS ALREADY IN FOR SPONSORING THE- BUDGET REPORTS THE RING BACK OR THE BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS THAT ARE REQUESTED BY OUR ASSOCIATION AND I'LL STAY HERE FOR QUESTIONS MY COACH. THANK YOU SIR NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DENISE LIKE KERR VICE PRESIDENT OF INDEPENDENCE AT HOME HE SCANNED COMMUNITY SERVICE. ADRIN MY NAME IS DENISE LIKE- AND I AM VICE PRESIDENT OF INDEPENDENCE AT HOME SCANNED COMMUNITY SERVICE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I AM ALSO HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE MSSP SITE ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE MULTIPURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM. MSSP IS IMPORTANT PART OF CALIFORNIA'S OLDER ADULTS SAFETYNET OF CARE WITH THIRTY NINE SITES ACROSS THE STATE. THE MULLAH CARE UTILIZES A PROFESSIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND REGISTERED NURSES. WORKING TOGETHER IN THE CLIENT'S HOME WITH FEET ON THE GROUND. DELIVERING CARE MANAGEMENT CARE COORDINATION TO THE FREE LISTING POOREST NURSING HOME ELIGIBLE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. WE WORK TO DO IT ALL HELPING THAT PERSON REMAIN AT HOME AVOIDING ANY INSTITUTIONALIZATION. MSSP STAFF MARSHAL EVERY RESOURCE AVAILABLE THREE PERSONS CURRENT BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY AND AS A LAST RESORT. WE CAN PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES TO AVOID UNNECESSARY ER VISITS HOSPITAL STAYS IN PREMATURE NURSING FACILITY PLACEMENT. THESE PURCHASES INCLUDE ANYTHING FROM OBTAINING REFRIGERATORS TO STORE MEDICATIONS TO OBTAINING CRITICAL LIFELINE SERVICES SUCH AS MEDICALLY NEEDED TRANSPORTATION AND FOOD. MSSP PROVIDES CLIENT CHOICE AND FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE CARE WE ARE PROVEN MODEL AND THE RESOURCE OF LAST RESORT FOR NUMEROUS SENIORS. THIS YEAR WE ARE BROUGHT FORTH A BUDGET ASKED TO CONTINUE THE CURRENT ANNUAL RATE PER CLIENT A FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX OR- FIVE FOUR POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY WITH THE SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THIS AREA. MSSP RECEIVED A THREE YEAR ONE TIME ONLY SUPPLEMENT IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET WHICH EXPIRES IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. PLEASE NOTE THE PRIOR TO TWENTY NINETEEN MSSP HAD NOT RECEIVED A COST OF LIVING INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. ONLY TO SEE THE PROGRAM FUNDING THEN CUT BY MORE THAN 22% ACROSS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WITHOUT CONTINUATION OF THIS RATE MSSP WHICH SERVES NEARLY TWELVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS PER YEAR. FACES A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR DESTRUCTION OF CARE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. EXAMPLES OF IMPACT INCLUDE AT LEAST TENEMENT MSSP PROVIDERS HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT SITE CLOSURE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY. FOR SITES NOT CONSIDERING CLOSURE. THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED IMPACTS SUCH AS LAYOFFS REDUCTIONS IN WAGES AND HOURS INCREASED AND AS WELL AS INCREASED WORKLOADS. BUT TOUCH A BENEFICIARY IMPACT INCLUDES BREAKS IN SERVICE TO THE SITE CLOSURE. INCREASED WAIT TIMES FOR ENROLLMENT AND SERVICES AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON LIVING SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT CAN LEAD TO NURSING HOME PLACEMENT. KEEP IN MIND THAT INVESTMENT OF FIFTY THREE FIFTY SIX PER YEAR PER BENEFICIARY. VERSUS THE MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR NURSING HOME PLACEMENT. IS A SAVINGS THAT CANNOT BE IGNORED. CONTINUANCE OF THIS RATE PRESERVES THE VIABILITY OF MSSP AND ENSURES CONTINUOUS DELIVERY OF CARE. BECAUSE M. S. AS P. AS IN THE COMMUNITY WE PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS EMERGENCIES AND NOW A PANDEMIC. GIVEN THAT WE ARE ON THE GROUND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE NIMBLE AND EXPEDIENT. EXAMPLES INCLUDE THROUGH COVERT NINETEEN WE KEPT PARTICIPANTS AT HOME. WE OBTAINED AND PROVIDED CRUCIAL PP. WE COMBATED SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS AS WELL AS CONNECTED BENEFICIARIES TO THEIR PROVIDERS FAMILIES AND FRIENDS BY PROVIDING LAPTOPS AND TABLETS WITH COACHING. AS WELL SO YOU HAVE SUPPORT OF COAL PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THEIR SAFETY. WE DELIVER FOOD TO THEIR DOORSTEPS WE ASSISTED WITH FINDING AND HIRING CAREGIVERS DURING A DRASTIC SHORTAGE OF WORKERS. AND NOW WE ARE SYSTEM WITH ALL ASPECTS OF FIGHTING SCHEDULING ACCESSING VACCINE APPOINTMENTS. WHEN THERE'S WILD FIRES AND POWER OUTAGES WE CREATE GO BAGS FOR DISASTER EVACUATION WE HELP WITH RELOCATION AND EMERGENCY HOUSING. WE CREATE EMERGENCY PLANS LIKE BACK UP BATTERIES FOR MEDICAL CORRECT EQUIPMENT AND PLANNING FOR FOOD. MSSP MOVES TOWARDS CRISIS WE DO NOT RETREAT OR RUN AWAY. AS WE LOOK TO THE MASTER PLAN AND CAL IN PROCESS. THAT ARE BUILDING TOWARDS THE FUTURE CARE FOR OUR SENIORS. WE MUST KEEP IN MISSISSIPPI IS A SEPARATE BENEFIT PROVIDING CHOICE AND HOW ARE NURSING HOME ELIGIBLE SENIORS RECEIVE ASSISTANCE TO REMAINING IN THE COMMUNITY. AS WE LEARN FROM THE CORNER CARE INITIATIVE. THE INDIVIDUALS AT MSSP STIRS. CHOSE MSSPS PROVEN TRUSTED COMMUNITY BASED MODEL FOR THEIR CARE COORDINATION AND SUPPORT. ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. MSSP SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO BECOME A MANDATORY OPTION OF CARE WITHIN THE SAFETY NET AND HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITY DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. WE RECOMMEND A TWO PHASED APPROACH TO THIS. FIRST RESTORE THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN CLIENTS LOTS ELIMINATED IN THE- EIGHT OH NINE RECESSION. THIS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ANY CURRENT WAIT LIST FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED OF SERVICES AND ALLOW FOR MORE ROBUST OUTREACH IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SECOND EXPAND MSSP STATEWIDE BY BRINGING THE PROGRAM TO THE FOURTEEN COUNTIES WE CURRENTLY DO NOT SERVE. MSSP IS A PROVEN COST EFFECTIVE MODEL OF CARE THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED AS PART OF BOTH THE MASTER PLAN AND CAL LANE. STABILIZING THE RATE EXPANDING THE PROGRAM TO ALL COUNTIES INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SLOTS. TAKING A MODERNIZED APPROACH TO PROGRAM DESIGN AND UTILIZING THE EXPERTISE OF THE HOST AGENCIES THROUGH ADDITIONAL CONTRACTING. WE CAN ENSURE THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE SENIORS ABSOL APPROVING CARE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. MSSP CAN SERVE MORE. AND WE WANT TO DO SO BECAUSE OUR SENIORS I MEAN A LOT TO US IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SERRA STEVE HOWSON SENIOR POLICY ADVISER WITH THE SCAN FOUNDATION. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING CHEN ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH A THOUGHTFUL AND IMPORTANT DISCUSSION I WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE BROAD THEMES REGARDING THE POTENTIAL AND PROMISE OF CALIFORNIA'S MASTER PLAN FOR AGENT. TO BEGAN AND AS MY COLLEAGUE CLLR RAMSEY SO ELOQUENTLY STATED WE HAVE SEEN HOW COVERED NINETEEN HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED OLDER ADULTS PARTICULARLY BLACK LATINO ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS AND INDIGENOUS POPULATION. WHILE ALSO BRINGING TO OUR ATTENTION TO OUR SYSTEM SHORTCOMINGS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF CHARTING AN EQUITABLE PATH FORWARD. AND AS DIRECTOR MAKORI WADE SAID EARLIER EQUITY REALLY IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE MASTER PLAN AND IT SHOULD BE BAKED INTO ALL ASSOCIATED POLICY AND PROGRAM ELEMENTS. SO I'M GONNA REFLECT ON THE THINGS THAT I HEARD THAT ARE CRITICAL PATH FORWARD WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING SEAMLESS SERVICE DELIVERY DATA INFRASTRUCTURE. WORKFORCE AND LEADERSHIP. SO THE FIRST NAME ABOUT SEAMLESS SERVICE. AND WE NEED TO RE FRAME HOW SERVICES ARE DELIVERED SEEING THEM AS PART OF A SEAMLESS CONTINUUM OF CARE NOT SILENCE STRUCTURES. INTO THIS AND EQUITY AN AGING RELIES NOT ONLY ON GOOD MEDICAL CARE BUT ALSO ON ACCESS TO SOCIAL SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND OTHERS. YEAH AS DISCUSSED BY MISPRINT YELL AT LANL WE MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS SERVICES WITH VARIOUS ASSESSMENTS AND ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS WE HAVE TO BREAK A LONGSTANDING SYSTEM FRAGMENTATION. THAT INHABITS ACCESS TO SERVICES AND INSTEAD WE NEED TO DEVELOP A MORE STREAMLINED INTEGRATED SYSTEM OF CARE. THE SECOND THEME IS ONE OF THE DATA AND HAS A PRIOR SPEAKER SAID IN ANOTHER PANEL THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IS TO DEFINE IT. AN EQUITABLE CHARGE FORWARD RELIES ON BETTER DATA SYSTEMS THAT TRACK HOW SERVICES ARE UTILIZED INCLUDING HEALTH CARE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION AND OTHERS. IN THE GRIP INTEGRATED DATA CAN BETTER CAN PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHO IS FALLING THROUGH THE CACKS AND WHERE THE GAPS ARE IN SERVICE DELIVERY. UNTIL WE HAVE A BETTER PICTURE OF THE NEED ACROSS THE SYSTEM IT WILL BE HARD TO TARGET RESOURCES IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER. THE THIRTY THING I THINK IS INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE WE HEARD FROM TODAY'S PANELISTS ABOUT TREMENDOUS UNMET NEED ACROSS OUR CORE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. WHETHER DUE TO LONG WAIT LISTS UNDER FUNDED PROGRAMS OR LACK OF AVAILABILITY. BUILDING THE STATE ROAD MAP FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT WITH THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS IS CENTRAL TO A SUCCESSFUL MASTER PLAN FOR AGENT. THE FORCED FOR THEME BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT OF THE WORK FORCE SO EVEN IF WE BUILD OUT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOP THE DATA AND FULLY FUNDED PROGRAMS WITHOUT A WORK FORCE PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING I THINK OUR PRIOR SPEAKERS EXPRESSED IT SO WELL. CALIFORNIA NEEDS A CULTURALLY COMPETENT WELL TRAINED WORKFORCE WITH QUALITY PAY BUT HE BELIEVES IN I HAVE SOME OF OUR INVESTING OUR FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TO. PROVIDE ADULTS IN THEIR HOME. THE FINAL THING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT REALLY UNDERCURRENTS ALL OF THE MONSTER AND AFTERWARDS AND THAT'S IT THAT IS THE THEME OF LEADERSHIP LEADERSHIP IS THE FOUNDATION OF SYSTEM CHANGE AN EXAMPLE OF EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN- DIRECTOR MCQUAY WADE'S READ IN. I'M CALLING FOR THE MASTER IN AND DEVELOPING A MASTER PLAN FOR AGING BUT A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING ALSO REQUIRES ENGAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE. IN FILLING OUT FOR TOGETHER TO DO THIS AND MUST PLAN FOR ASIANS COMMITMENT TO ESTABLISHING A SENIOR ADVISER FOR AGING DISABILITY AND OUTSIDERS WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS THE FIRST CRITICAL STEP. TO ENSURING CONTINUED PROGRESS IN THESE EFFORTS. SO INCLUDING THESE FIVE THEMES OF SEAMLESS SERVICE DELIVERY DATA INFRASTRUCTURE WORKFORCE AND LEADERSHIP ARE EACH CRITICAL TO OUR MASTER PLAN EFFORTS AND THESE ISSUES ARE SIMILAR SIMILAR TO THOSE ELEVATED ACROSS ALL PANELS TODAY. ON ISSUES LIKE POVERTY AND ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY SHOWING THAT THE CHALLENGES CONFRONTING OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IMPACTING CHILDREN IN FAMILIES. THE SOLUTIONS MY VERY BUT THE COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES MUST BE CONSISTENT ACROSS POPULATIONS. THERE WAS TREMENDOUS HOPE THAT THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING ILL FUNDAMENTALLY RE FRAME THE WAY WE COLLECTIVELY FEEL AND START CALIFORNIA'S OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. ENDING THE SIX STIGMATA SOCIAIS DID WITH AGING BECAUSE IN REALITY AGING IS ALL OF US IT TOUCHES INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES COMMUNITIES EMPLOYERS AND INSTITUTIONS THESE ISSUES ARE EVERYONE'S ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO BE HERE TODAY AND I'M HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL NOW BRING IT TO THE FOR QUEST AND- I'M GONNA START WITH THE DEPARTMENT TIE- YOU. MUST ADMIT TO BEING SURPRISED SEEING YOUR REACTION TO THE AUDITORS- RECOMMENDATIONS AND WANTED TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING FROM YOU IF YOU COULD OR GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN FURTHER. THANK YOU CHAIR KIM JOHNSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DAD JUST START BY SAYING THAT- WHILE WE DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH EVERY RECOMMENDATION RAISED IN THE REPORT WE STRONGLY STRONGLY AGREE WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT ALL. AGES THAT'S RECIPIENTS TO THE STATE RECEIVED THAT PROMPT APPROVAL FOR SERVICES AND RECEIVE ALL THE SERVICES THAT THEY'VE BEEN APPROVED FOR SO. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- WE FULLY RECOGNIZE- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN THIS PANEL AROUND THE TREMENDOUS WORK THAT MANY MANY STAKEHOLDERS HAVE COME TOGETHER TO DEVELOP IN THE MASTER PLAN OF AGING. AT THAT THE NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO GO LONG TERM SERVICES SUBCOMMITTEE THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ASK AGAIN ON THIS PANEL- IT'S ABSOLUTELY ARE CRITICAL OF PRIORITY WE HAVE A FORMAL RESPONSE AS YOU AS YOU'VE ALLUDED TO ADD TO THE AUDIT IN THE SPECIFICS. SOME OF THE- SPECIFICS WERE EVEN RAISED IN TERMS OF WHAT THE AUDITOR I DESCRIBED ON THE CONTEXT FOR EXAMPLE OF WHY AN INDIVIDUAL MAY NOT HAVE RECEIVED HOURS WITHIN A GIVEN MONTH AGAIN IT'LL WE ALLOW FOR RETROACTIVE. PAYMENTS ONCE THE PROVIDER IS IDENTIFIED NON LINE SO AGAIN- BUT LOOK AT FULLY APPRECIATES THE GOAL OF THE REPORT AT AND- CERTAINLY- LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED WITH AN EX. AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS. ACROSS THE STATE THANKS. IF I CAN FOLLOW UP HOW DO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AND IT IF WANNA- TOSS IT TO DENISE THOMPSON THAT'S OKAY AS WELL. BUT HOW DO WE ACHIEVE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND QUALITY WITHIN THIS PROGRAM I THINK- FOR MANY OF US WE- LOOK TOWARDS- WHAT IS IN STATE LAW AND- BEHIND- BOTHERED AGAIN BY WHAT THE AUDITOR STATED AND- THE LACK OF INFORMATION WE HAVE IS A LEGISLATURE. TIM GLAD TO GLAD TO SUPPORT FELLOW PANELISTS AND IN AT PROVIDING THEIR OWN RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE SPACE BUT- AGAIN IN TERMS OF ASSESSMENT IN TERMS OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE PUT IN PLACE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR. TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ABBY ASSASSIN ALLOW FOR SOME ABOUT TO OCCUR REMOTELY. THESE ARE ALL WAYS THAT AGAIN WE ARE ENSURING ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM. AND CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF TIMELINESS AS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING FROM THE STATE HAS BEEN A KEY COMPONENT OF FACT THAT CERTAINLY WOULD WELCOME AT AGE RECOMMENDATIONS AND GLAD TO CONTINUE EXPLORING WAYS TO IMPROVE- MISS THOMPSON ARE YOU ABLE TO COMMENT ON THIS. THE GOOD EVENING HAS CERTAINLY- I THINK THAT WE CERTAINLY DO AGREE WITH THE PROMISE OF SUPPORTING AND HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND ENSURING THAT THINGS ARE BEING DONE IN THE APPROPRIATE WAYS THAT SERVICES ARE GETTING- CONNECTED TO OUR RECIPIENTS AS THEY BECOME ELIGIBLE I THINK THAT IT WAS- SOME MIS UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE- PARTICULAR. LAND THAT'S BEING REFERRED TO BY THE AUDITOR IS REALLY AN OLD ARM. AN OLD PLANNING TOOL THAT WAS UTILIZED WHEN THEY COUNTIES WERE ACTUALLY USING HOMEMAKERS AND COUNTY STAFF WERE- THE PROVIDERS OF SERVICE THE WAY THAT WE DO PLANNING NOW AND THE WAY THAT WE WORK WITH THE COUNTIES AND ENSURING THAT RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDERS ARE. CONNECTED AND THAT SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED IS A DIFFERENT PROCESS NOT THAT ONE DOESN'T EXIST AT ALL AND SO THAT IS A CRITICAL THING THAT COUNTIES WORK ON REGULARLY AND THAT WE WORK WITH THEM ON ENSURING IT IS HAPPENING. SO HOPE THAT HELPS I'M I'M MAY MOVE US ON AND- ASK NOW IF I CAN ABOUT THE AUTOMATED TERMINATIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING FOR HIGH HSS WANNA. REDETERMINATION IS NOT COMPLETE- I WILL- SHARE THAT- FAMILY MEMBER OF MINE HAD AN AUTOMATIC TERMINATION WHEN SHE WAS IN AN I SEE YOU GOING THROUGH- CRITICAL MOMENT BEFORE SHE PASSED. AND IT WAS HARD FOR US AS A FAMILY TO RECEIVE THE AUTOMATIC TERMINATION FOR HER NOT COMPLETING THE PAPERWORK WHILE SHE WAS- GOING THROUGH THAT AND SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND PREVALENT THIS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE. CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHY WE HAVE THE NECESSITY FOR THE AUTOMATIC TERMINATION. SO CURRENTLY ACTUALLY THE AUTOMATED TERMINATION IS NOT IN PLACE. IT IS NOT IN POLICY AND DOES HAPPEN TO COUNTY- PROCESSES ALREADY SO IT'S NOT A NEW POLICY AND WHAT IT REALLY IS DRIVEN BY IS MEDIKAL ELIGIBILITY AND IT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH- EIGHT. ALIGNING IT TO SILENCE AND MEDIKAL SO THAT WHEN MEDICARE WAS TERMINATED AS EVERY OTHER I AM MEDICAL BENEFIT IT OCCURS THAT THAT BENEFIT IS ALSO I'M NOT AVAILABLE WHAT WE REALLY ARM HAVE FOUND AND I'VE- WORKED IN THIS PROGRAM IN THE COUNTY FOR MANY MANY YEARS ALSO. AND WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS OFTENTIMES THE LOSE MEDIC HOW AND NOT- AND NOT BE AWARE OF IT WHEREAS A OFTENTIMES WHEN THEY GET I HSS NOTICES THEY BECOME AWARE THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED WITH PARAMEDIC HOUSE AND THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY- TO RECONNECT THEM WITH MEDIC COW BECAUSE WITH I JUST AS THERE IS A SOCIAL WORKER THERE IS COUNTY STAFF THAT ARE AVAILABLE. TO HELP FACILITATE THAT PROCESS THE INTENT IS TO GET PEOPLE BACK ON TO THEIR MEDICARE OUT AND THE AUTOMATION ACTUAL WE WILL ALSO AUTOMATICALLY RECONNECT PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE- REESTABLISH THEIR MEDIC HOW RATHER THAN REQUIRE- THE CURRENT PROCESS WHICH IS MANUAL THAT WHEN THEY RE ESTABLISH. THE IT REQUIRES THE COUNTY TO TAKE AN ACTION TO REESTABLISH THEIR AYE IT JUST SUCKS SO WE HOPE THAT THAT ON MATT NATION WILL ALSO SUPPORT THAT. RECONNECTION IN A MUCH. MORE EFFICIENT WAY AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER BUT I STILL BELIEVE THERE IS A BIT OF CONFUSION AND SO I MAY ASK FOR A MEETING SOON BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT STAFF L. A. N. O. AND C. W. D. A. SO WE CAN WORK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES IF YOU'RE AMENABLE TO THAT. I'M OF COURSE HAPPY TO HAVE ANY CONVERSATIONS WOULD LIKE TO TRANSITION NOW IF I CAN TO THE STRUCK DURING THE COMMENTS THAT THIS WAS THE PREVIOUS RECESSION NOT TE CURRENT RECESSION THEN WERE END AND I'M WONDERING WHEN WE PLAN ON REMOVING THE 7% REDUCTION- FROM THE BOOKS. SOON THERE IS NOT A CURRENT PROPOSAL TO REMOVE THAT FROM THE STATUTE. ON THAT AS WE TALKED ABOUT IT HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED IT IS CONTINUED TO BE SUSPENDED. ON SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER. OFFER HI I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THE- FINDINGS FROM THE AUDITOR'S REPORT ABOUT PAY FOR THOSE WHO I HSS WORKERS AND I JUST RECOMMEND THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE- BEING INTELLECTUALLY HONEST. ABOUT THE PROPOSALS THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD- IF I CAN I WILL NOW MOVES ON TO THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE AND WANTED TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION REGARDING THE SIXTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE. SPLIT AND WHY IT WAS BEING SHIFTED AND- JUST YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND THAT. I'M WONDERING IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MIGHT BE IT THE BETTER- RESPONDER ON THIS I DON'T KNOW IF JUSTIN STILL HERE- I CAN CERTAINLY EXPLAIN THE- YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CURRENT STATUTE AS FAR AS HOW IT HOW IT WORKS. HAPPY TO DO THAT AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING ON SO. I IN THE LAST- REALIGNMENT LOOKING AT THE REALIGNMENT REPORT AND THE LAST REVIEW BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- HOW THE AND- WE'VE WORKED ON THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF- ANALYSIS. TO DETERMINE THE BEST APPROACH TO INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH C. STARK AND- COUNTIES TO DETERMINE THE BEST APPROACH TO THE FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR THE PROGRAM AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS IT WAS A STRAIGHT SPLIT UP THE PROGRAM COSTS BETWEEN. THAT THE FEDS AND THEN THE REMAINING SHARE BEING SPLIT SIXTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE BETWEEN THAT STATE AND THE COUNTIES- IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE BEGAN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT AND BACK THEN WAS REPEAT RE BASED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THEN. REVIEWED AGAIN- AS A PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PROCESS THERE WAS THE AND OUT THE- REQUIREMENT TO DO AN ANALYSIS FOR THAT- REALIGNMENTS FUNDING AND TO LOOK AT THAT. AND THAT THEN THE NEW ARE NINETEEN TWENTY WAS IMPLEMENTED THE MOST RECENT MLB- THAT INCLUDES THE ANNUAL INFLATOR FOR THE COUNTIES AND THEN THERE UP PARTICIPATION IN ANYTHING THAT'S LOCALLY BARGAINS. OUT OF AN INCREASE AND THE INCREASED DATA OUR SWITCH- TO A SIXTY FIVE COUNTY THIRTY FIVE STATE- AND IT ALSO REMOVED THE PARTICIPATION CAP. SO THAT THE STATE WILL PARTICIPATE IN ANYTHING THAT'S BARGAINED BY THE COUNTIES AT 35% WHEREAS WITH THE PARTICIPATION CAP. ANYTHING ABOVE- I THAT STATE CAP WAS A HUNDRED CHEN FUND OF THE OF THE NON FEDERAL. SO THAT'S- AND OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND I INVITE FINANCE IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO AND- I'M NOT. YES DOESN'T REYES FORMER FINANCE- I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO NEED TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF CITIES HEARING- THERE ARE A LOT OF CROSS OVER A CROSS CUTTING ISSUES THEY HAD DIFFERENT AREAS AND THIS UNFORTUNATELY IS ONE OF THE ONES THAT I DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION FOR YOU AT THE MOMENT DOCTOR AND NOT SO- IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF. ON GETTING THAT RESPONSE WERE YOU. HAPPY TO- THANK YOU FOR THAT. I WILL. I WILL LEAVE IT THERE FOR NOW IF THAT'S ALRIGHT- I WILL ASK- FOR KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD'S WITH CWD EIGHT TO COME INTO THE CONVERSATION I'D LIKE TO GET HER PERSPECTIVE- REGARDING A FEW OF THE THINGS WE JUST SPOKE WITH THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT SPECIFICALLY I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON AUTOMATED TERMINATIONS FOR HSS WHEN. WE DETERMINATION IS NOT COMPLETE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M HAPPY TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ON THAT ON THAT PROPOSAL. WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL NEEDS SIGNIFICANT WORK IF IT'S CONSIDERED AN ALL IN PARTICULAR THE IDEA THAT A PERSON LOSING THAT ACCOUNTS AND ALSO AUTOMATICALLY LOSE AYE TO FAST. AND ONLY BE REINSTATED AFTER THEY ARE PUT BACK ON TO THE SYSTEM OF MEDIC HEALTH IS HIGHLY INEQUITABLE TERM RECIPIENTS AND WOULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF SERVICES. OUR RECIPIENTS HEALTH AND WELL BEING IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY. REMEMBER OUR RECIPIENTS MUST MEET AND INCOME TAX TO QUALIFY FOR THE SERVICES THEY ARE NOT WELL OFF. THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD SOMEHOW COME UP WITH FUNDS TO PAY PROVIDERS IN THE TIME BETWEEN A MEDICAL DISCONTINUANCE AND REINSTATEMENT AS- THE LEADER THINKING AND SO THAT SOME OF THE IDEA THAT A PROVIDER. CAN CONTINUE WORKING FOR FREE IN THE HOPE THAT THE RECIPIENT WILL BE REINSTATED TO THE PROGRAM- I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE A LIVING THEY CAN'T WORK FOR FREE. THE PROVIDERS WILL HAVE TO GO FIND ANOTHER RECIPIENT TO WORK FOR FIND A NEW JOB IF THEY'RE NOT BEING PAID FOR POTENTIALLY MONTHS BEFORE THAT PERSON IS REINSTATED. AT A MINIMUM WE COULD SAY IF THIS IS CONSIDERED. RECIPIENTS SHOULD RECEIVE SERVICE RECEIVE SERVICES FOR A MUCH LONGER GRACE PERIOD. THE NAVY CONTEMPLATED. FOR OUR WE'VE BEEN TALKING EARLIER RIGHT THAT MEDICARE RECIPIENTS NOW HAVE A NINETY DAY GRACE PERIOD. TO BE REINSTATED AFTER DISCONTINUING SO THEY MAY BE DISCONTINUED AND THREE MONTHS LATER THEY COME BACK IN. WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE- MOST OFTEN IT IS THAT. FAILURE TO PROVIDE A DOCUMENT OR SOME PIECE OF INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO RENEW THEIR COVERAGE. COUNTIES ARE THEN HELP THEM GET ON TO MEDICARE ALL. SO WHY WOULD WE NOT WAIT. CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PERSON AND I HAD TO FIVE. AND GIVEN THAT PERIOD OF TIME FOR THEM TO BE REINSTATED AGAIN IF WE EVEN IF YOU'RE EVEN CONSIDERING KIND OF GOING FORTH WITH THIS PROPOSAL. I THINK THE L. A. O. DOES. I WAS. PRETTY NEW STAFFER AT CEDAR BDA WHEN WE BEGAN TO REFINANCE THE ITEMS THAT'S PROGRAM WHICH AT THAT TIME. WAS STILL RELATIVELY SMALL BUT HAD STARTED TO GROW ESPECIALLY AS A RESULT OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR COUNTIES TO DO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WITH OUR- ITEMS THAT'S PROVIDERS. AND SO- AS A STATE EVERYONE BE KIND OF YOU KNOW KIND OF BEGAN LOOKING AROUND. AND SO WAS OVER TIME IN A NUMBER OF CHUNKS THAT WE RE AND YOU KNOW WE FINANCED THE PROGRAM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THE RESIDUAL PROGRAM WAS WHAT WAS LEFT- UP UNTIL THIS POINT. I'VE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEING- SOMETHING THAT WE WOULDN'T JUST MOVE PEOPLE INTO IF THEY WERE FASTER MEDICARE I'LL- AND THEN HOPEFULLY GET THEM REINSTATED MOVE THEM BACK INTO THE REGULAR PROGRAM. RATHER THAN JUST YOU KNOW COMPLETELY CUT THEM OFF. I THINK INCLUDING IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD JUST AFTER SOME OF THE FIFTH IS THIS REALLY THE TIME WE WANT TO BE KICKING. ADULTS AND CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES OFTEN PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO HELP IT WOULD SAFELY AT HOME. I MEAN WE'RE IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT HAS MOST THAT OUR ELDERS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES LIVING IN CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES. AND THIS JUST SEEMS LIKE MAYBE NOT THE TIME. TO CUT PEOPLE OFF FROM SERVICES THEY NEED ESPECIALLY SERVICES ARE GETTING TO HELP AVOID THAT TYPE. OF CHARACTER FIRST PLACE. I AGREE AND THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE- WOULD TO IF I COULD. UP AND GET YOUR IF YOU. ON THE AUDITORS FINDINGS- AND THE RESPONSE THAT WE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. HELLO SIR I AM HAPPY TO ALSO PROVIDE- SOME BOTS FIRST. MISTER CHAIR BANKING YOUR INDULGENCE I DO- JUST WANT TO- HI I CAN. EARLIER I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS WITHOUT REMEMBERING CHECKS PRIVACY TO BE A SUPPORT FOR THE SHARING RATIO PROPOSAL THE JACKSON GARRETT FROM C. SACK PRESENTED AND ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH HIS REMARKS IN OPPOSITION TO THE PENALTY PROPOSAL THAT MEANS YOU PRESENTE- QUICKLY I JUST ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS YOU. SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON THE AGENDA AND FINALLY THE SINCERELY THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF OUR COALITION YOUR CHAMPIONING OF THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROPOSAL. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE END OF THE SUMMER REGARDING A STATE AUDIT WORK CONTINUING TO EXPLORE THE AUDITORS FINDINGS BUT CAN ALSO SURELY THAT COUNTY ONE OF THE ALL ITEMS THAT CONSUMERS RECEIVE THE SERVICES THEY ARE AUTHORIZED TO RECEIVE. WE DO SUPPORT THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION TO USE THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS TO ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR COUNTIES TO INCREASE WAGES FOR PROVIDERS AS WELL. AND OBVIOUSLY WE ALSO NOTED IF YOU DID A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IT IS TAKING TO PROCESS INCOMING CASES. WE JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE THE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS UNDER WHICH COUNTIES OPERATE ITEMS THAT'S ON THE STATE THAT. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE LACK OF SOCIAL WORKER RESOURCES IN ADDITION TO THE BURDENSOME PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THAT STRETCH THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS. OUT FOR THE LEVEL FOUND IN THE AUDIT. I NEED TO MADE UNDER FOR THAT CAR OF OUR STAFF. DURING MOST OF THE- REVIEW BY THE ON THAT FIVE TO TWENTY NINETEEN. NINETY EIGHT. COSTS WERE FUNDED AT TWO. THREE THOUSAND AND ONE STAFF CLASS LEVELS. MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS BEHIND THE ACTUAL COST OF DOING BUSINESS DURING THOSE YEARS. THE STAFFING COST ASSUMPTIONS WERE FINALLY RE BASED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUT IT WAS USING TWENTY SEVENTEEN BETA. AND SINCE THAT TIME THE COST OF NOT BEEN UPDATED AGAIN THERE'S NO MECHANISM TO DO SO AUTOMATICALLY AND COUNTIES WERE OVERALL HOLD STAGNANT FOR COUNTY ADMINISTRATION FUNDING. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE FELL BEHIND IN THE CLASS OF ACTUALLY ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM NOT JUST STAFFING COSTS. SO THEY'RE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET THAT YOU'RE NOW CONSIDERING PROPOSAL TO CATCH COUNTIES UPPER CASE LOAD GROWTH. BUT NOT FOR THE ACTUAL COST OF THE COUNTY WORKER SO ALREADY BEFORE YEARS BEHIND OUR ACTUAL COSTS WHEN YOU ADOPT THE BUDGET THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING. SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE STOPS AND STARTS A COUNTY ADMIN FUNDING AND THE HISTORIC UNDERFUNDING OF ACTUAL STAFF COST. SIMPLY DO NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR COUNTIES THE PLAN OF OUR- TO FULLY SERVE OUR CLIENTS AND REQUIRED TIMELINES AS WE. WOULD LIKE TO DO. THANK YOU. I WILL JUST A FIVE CAN IF THAT PERCENTAGE CHANGE COAST. I'M TO ECHO THAT COMMENTS AND CONCERN REGARDING PUBLIC HEALTH% AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT THE COUNTY WILL BE PROVIDING AND HAVING TO. NOW MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO NOW AS MY FINAL QUESTION OF THE L. A. O. AND I'D LIKE TO- SIMILARLY AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE- CAN YOU HELP US. TO CAN YOU DISCUSS WHAT FUNDS CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE- IN ADVANCE OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING IN THE RECENTLY APPROVED AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. SURE I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THAT QUESTION I THINK AS PANELIST HAVE MENTIONED THERE ARE FUNDS THAT ARE DIRECTLY YEAR MARKED TO- AGING PROGRAMS LIKE THE OLDER AMERICAN ACTS PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE NUTRITION SERVICES AND LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. I'M ADDITIONALLY THERE'S- FUNDING PROVIDED TO INCREASE THE FOR A MEDIC CAL F. MAP FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS. THAT COULD POSSIBLY NOT ONLY ASSIST THE STATE IN MAINTAINING SERVICE LEVELS BUT TO ENSURE WE EXPAND ACCESS TO THESE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS WHICH IS A RECOMMENDATION WITHIN THE MASTER PLAN- FOR AGING IDENTIFY WAYS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO LTSS. BUT BEYOND TO THOSE I'M FUNDS THAT ARE DIRECTLY YEAR MARKED- FOR AGING PROGRAMS- OUR OFFICE IS STILL EVALUATING THE AVAILABLE USES OF THE MORE GENERAL STATE PUBLIC NINETEEN RELIEF FUNDS- BUT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IN THE RECENT FEDERAL ACTION- INITIAL QUESTIONS THAT COME TO MIND WHAT AS THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERING. POSSIBLE USES FOR THOSE MORE GENERAL FUND INCLUDE WELL ONE HOW RESTRICTIVE- ARE THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE APPROPRIATE USES FOR THOSE FUNDS I'M COULD THOSE FUNDS POSSIBLY BE USED TO PROVIDE I'M DIRECT FUNDING PAYMENTS TO RECIPIENTS OF STATE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS LIKE WE DID UNDER THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS- THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE. SHOULD TARGET THE RESOURCES TO INDIVIDUALS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR OTHER FEDERAL STIMULUS PAYMENTS IN THE PAST- BUT THEN ALSO THERE'S A QUESTION OF COULD THESE FUNDS BE USED TO EASE THE RAMP DOWN. OF PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED TEMPORARY FEDERAL FUNDS- AT GOT INCREASED TO SERVICE DELIVERY LEVELS. FOR PROGRAMS LIKE SENIOR NUTRITION. BUT AGAIN AND ARE JUST A PART BACK TO MY IN OUR OFFICE I WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE CONCRETE COMMENTS AS WE- CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE ACT AND ALSO REVIEW ANY GUIDANCE THAT'S PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON EXACTLY WHAT THE FEDERAL FUNDS CAN BE SPENT ON. THANK YOU FOR THAT- I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT IF I COULD AND HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THE- BEST DATA POINTS I HEARD TODAY AND IT WAS FROM HER DIRECTOR FROM EIGHTEEN MILLION TO.

BUDGET FLEXIBILITY SHOULD NOT BE HAD- STARTING EVERY YEAR WITH THE MOST VULNERABLE LET ALONE HAVE THAT WRITTEN INTO LAWSUIT IT'S MANDATED TO GO THAT WAY. I WAS DOING IT THE WAY THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING IT DOES NOT PASS THE EQUITY TEST DOESN'T PASS THE SMELL TEST EITHER PLEASE GET RID OF THAT PERMANENTLY. ITEM NUMBER TWO- PLEASE MAINTAIN THE COVERT RELATED PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY IS THAT IT HAS BEEN REALLY BENEFICIAL- TO MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW INCLUDING ME AND MY PARTNER WHO IS THE MAIN PERSON THAT I CARE FOR- I'M PARTICULARLY THINKING IN THIS INSTANCE OF THE PROVIDER BACKUP REGISTRY WHICH AS RESEARCH ALL I SAID PREVIOUSLY IN THE COMMENTS. SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE PARAMEDICAL SERVICES I AND ALSO THE ABILITY OF PROGRAMS LIKE M. S. S. P. TO PROVIDE SERVICES REMOTELY INCLUDING. THINGS LIKE ADULT DAY HEALTH- I NUMBER THREE. DO TAKE THE ALL A- AND- WORK ON GETTING THE COUNTIES TO GET WAGES UP TO OF A LIVING WAGE PLACE AND PROVIDE BENEFITS- LIKE RETIREMENT AND SICKLY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO HAVE A WORK FORCE FOR HOME CARE THAT CAN KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND THAT THAT'S COMING OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS IT ISN'T JUST THE AUDITOR WHO SAID THAT. NUMEROUS REPORTS AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HAVE SAID THE SAME THING- USE CARROTS IN EVERY CASE THAT YOU CAN BUT IF THE CARROTS DON'T WORK WE MAY NEED STEP. I AM I AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF DOING SOMETHING LIKE- THE 10% PENALTY TO BRING THOSE COUNTIES TO THE TABLE WHO HAVE. REFUSED TO BE THERE AS FAR. AS THE SIXTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE BUT THIS CONCERNED THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY DISASTROUS PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT- DO EXPAND THE MSSP PROGRAM I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT THIS PROGRAM- THE SOCIAL WORKERS THERE. I HAVE DONE MORE FOR ME AND MY PARTNER IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WHERE WE REALLY DESPERATELY NEEDED HELP WITH SOMETHING AND IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE DISASTROUS.

AND THAT PULLED US THROUGH I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT IT. EXPANDED HOWEVER YOU CAN TO GIVE MORE PEOPLE ACCESS TO IT- THE IDEA OF AUTOMATIC TERMINATIONS. I HSS. WHEN A PERSON CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER TO GET IN THE PAPERWORK. TO BE RE UPPED FOR SS AS I. IS A INCREDIBLY BAD I'D- PLEASE DON'T THAT IF THINK YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN EXTENDED GRACE PERIOD BECAUSE YOU'LL END UP WITH PEOPLE- EITHER DEAD OR IN NURSING HOMES IF YOU DON'T. FINAL THING- THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING'S- RECOMMENDATION TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF MAKING A LONG TERM- SERVICES BENEFIT. AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE SOMETHING THAT WILL NOT BE MEANS TESTED IS. REALLY WHERE WE HAVE TO GO ON THIS I ACCESSING THESE KIND OF SUPPORTS IT SHOULD NOT HAVE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR IT SPENDING YOURSELF DOWN INTO POVERTY AND THEN KEEPING YOURSELF THERE FOREVER. THAT'S JUST WRONG ON ABOUT A MILLION DIFFERENT- PARAMETERS AND ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT MODEL AND TO A MODEL THAT HAS LONG TERM SERVICES INCLUDED AS BENEFITS THAT EVERYONE HAS AFFECT ACCESS TO.

GOOD EVENING THANK YOU CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF MY NAME IS BRUCE WHAT'S FROM SENIOR DIRECTOR PRESIDENT'S YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES. AN AGENCY THAT'S BEEN SERVING YOU SINCE EIGHTEEN. NINETY ONE. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SPOKE QUITE ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES IN S. C. R. T. P. IS ESPECIALLY DURING THE LAST YEAR THE QUOTE THAT. I WON'T GO OVER THOSE DETAILS AGAIN. BUT I WILL COMMENT THE PRIOR TO THIS CODED WAYS. MANY OF US WERE ALREADY SWIMMING UPSTREAM TRYING TO KEEP OUR HEADS UP CLOSE TO THE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES WITHOUT SECURITY TEAMS. THANK YOU ITEMS OF NOTE FIRST. IT'S BEEN WELL ILLUSTRATED THE CRITICAL TRAUMA INFORMED TREATMENT THAT WE PROVIDE. HOWEVER WE ALSO SERVICE SURROGATE PARENTS TEACHERS COACHES EXPRESSIVE ARTS INSTRUCTORS AND MANY MORE. ALL OF WHICH ROLES ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY FUNDED. THESE AS IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER ARE OFTEN FUNDED BY DONOR DEVELOPMENT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION LAST YEAR T. P.'S WORK ABOUT. WHILE THEY WERE DEVELOPED AT THE SAME TIME WE ALL SAW SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE MINIMUM WAGE MANDATES. THIS CREATES UPWARD PRESSURE AND ADDED COST TO STAFF AND- WHICH AGAIN IS THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON TOP OF THOSE CHALLENGES RELATED TO THIS PAST YEAR CORRECTLY AFFECTED. BACKING US BECAUSE THE PROGRAM. IT SHOULD BE AT THE UNIT S. T. R. T. T. SERVICE. BEING CALLED ON QUOTE THE NEXT LEVEL OF CARE UNDER A ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL HAS BEEN INCREASING EVERY YEAR. REQUIRING IT SOMETIMES A STAFF PERSON FOR EVERY CHILD OR TWO CHILDREN. NOT THE RATIOS THAT WERE INTENDED IN THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE OF S. U. R. T. P. AND THE RESULTING BUDGET THAT GIVES. LASTLY I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE TO AS IT HAS BEEN WITH THAT BUT BASS SOCIAL WORKERS. THE TEN YEAR AND COURTESY OF OUR STAFF IS CRITICAL. TO THE SUPPORT STABILITY AND SEALING UP THE CHILDREN THAT WE SERVE. SO AGAIN I SPEAK IN SUPPORT FOR THE S. T. R. T. PAY IS ONE TIME. SUPPORT AS WELL AS THE ONGOING SUPPORT FOR- STABILITY OF FSA WORKERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO FOR THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SIR. SHE I NEXT TIME IT COMES FROM LINE. TWO ZERO FOUR NINE TWO ZERO FIVE FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN- ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR LETTING YOU TESTIFY. I LISTEN TO THE HEARING ALL DAY. MY NAME IS CONNIE ARNOLD. I'M A DISABILITY RIGHTS ADVOCATE FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS. PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT ACTUALLY. I'M AND I HSS RECIPIENT AND I'M ALSO ON. ON A WAIVER WAIVER PERSONAL CARE SERVICES. AND I'VE BEEN ON I JUST THAT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WHEN IT WAS HOMEMAKER CHORE. BACK IN THE PROVIDERS WERE PAID THREE DOLLARS AND THIRTY SIX CENTS GROSS PER HOUR. AND IT WAS WHEN RECIPIENTS HIRED PROVIDERS. I DON'T REMEMBER ANY COUNTY EMPLOYEES BEING PROVIDERS- I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE STATE HAS EXEMPTED ITSELF FROM LIABILITY FOR DEEMING RECIPIENTS AN EMPLOYER AND AFTERWARDS LIABILITY FOR THE STATE INCLUDING ITS EXCLUSION UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ELDER AND DEPENDENT ADULT SILVA PROTECTION ACT BECAUSE THE STATE IS DIRECTLY CAUSING NEGLECT ABUSE AND HARM ON SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES BECAUSE THEY'RE CALLING IT. OUR CHOI. IN WHO WE HIRE PERMANENT ABSENT WORKFORCE BASED ON ONE RACK OF COMPETENT AND READILY AVAILABLE WORKFORCE. AND LACK OF MEANINGFUL CHOICE OF ACCESS TO PROGRAMS SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES IN VIOLATION OF THE ADA. AND OLMSTEAD FOR RECIPIENTS EMPLOYERS TO LEAD A NORMAL AND FULFILLING LIFE. THERE'S A LACK OF RECIPIENT HAS BEEN LTSS BUDGETS INCLUDING TRAINING BUDGETS FOR EXISTING- RECIPIENTS FOR. THE LADY TO TRAIN PROVIDERS AND ALLOW- OUR EXISTING PROVIDER TO HELP TRAIN POTENTIAL NEW PROVIDERS ON OUR ROUTINES. AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF ONE SIZE TRAINING CONTRACT. THERE'S A REAL LACK OF DIFFERENTIAL PAY FOR PROVIDERS WILLING TO WORK FOR HSS RECIPIENTS WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES WHO HAVE MULTIPLE CARE PROVIDERS WHERE AT LEAST ONE IS A NON RELATIVE COMMUNITY PROVIDER AND THAT IS AN ESSENTIAL NEED IF YOU DON'T HAVE DIFFERENTIATED PAY. FOR PEOPLE WILLING TO WORK FOR THOSE WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES WILL NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND PROVIDERS THERE'S NO RELIABLE- TWENTY FOUR SEVEN BACKUP EMERGENCY SERVICE WITH ACCESSIBLE REGIONAL ON CALL SERVICE CENTERS. RECIPIENTS WHO CAN DEPLOY A COMPETENT WORKERS. WHO CAN PROVIDE CARE MEDICAL SERVICES PROTECTIVE SUPERVISION OR HANDLE COBIT POSITIVE SITUATIONS. TO MEET RECIPIENTS NEEDS- THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION THAT THOSE OF US THAT ARE ON THE WAIVER THAT THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO HELP FIND IN SUPPLY SUBSTITUTE CARE PROVIDERS WHICH ISN'T THEIR JOB AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE WORKERS. I THINK SOME OF THE OTHERS SPEAKERS HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT M. S. S. P. WHICH IS A SEPARATE CHOICE AND FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT THE GOOD THING. MANAGED CARE FOR MOVING IN THE DIRECTION MANAGED CARE THAT ISN'T GOING TO WORK WITHOUT RAISING THE WAGES AND DIFFERENTIATING WAGES- AS FAR AS THE COUNTIES GO- AS FAR AS I KNOW MOST OF THE COUNTY I JUST AS WORKERS ARE MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS AND NOT SOCIAL WORKERS AND THAT SHOULD CHANGE. AND FOR THE COUNTIES THERE'S NO PENALTY IF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE SENIORS GO INTO A NURSING HOME AT STATE COST. AND I FIND IT REALLY SHOCKING THAT WE WANT TO MOVE MORE PEOPLE. AND I SUPPORT MOVING MORE PEOPLE. LIKE THE CCT PROGRAM FROM THE NURSING HOMES TO THE COMMUNITY. BUT WHAT WAS GOING TO WORK FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHAT ABSENT EIGHT. WORKFORCE ALSO THERE'S NO HOLIDAY PAY- FOR PROVIDERS SO THAT ON HOLIDAYS PROVIDERS ARE ABANDONED. I'M LOOKING AT MY FACEBOOK PAGE RIGHT NOW AND I KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S A QUADRIPLEGIC AND SAN MATTEO. RIGHT NOW THE INTERNET HAD HER CARE GIVER CONTRACTORS SAY THEY HAD A COP IN A BODY ACHE AND NOW THAT THEY CAN'T COME TO WORK. NOW SHE'S STUCK WITH NO HELP AND STUCK IN BED FOR THREE WEEKS SHE SAYS. BECAUSE THE WAY THAT LIST THAT WE GET FROM THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY A WORK LIST. I HAVE ANOTHER PERSON WITH A SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY WHO'S IN L. EIGHT. CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF A PROVIDER. AND SHE'S ABSENT A PROVIDER IN THE PAST. WHICH IS THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY IN LA CAN'T FIND ANYBODY TO HELP HER AND SHE'S BEEN HAVING DIFFICULTY FOR TWO DAYS AND CONTACTED HER WAIVER AGENCY AND STILL THERE IS NO HELP- ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION IS ONLY GOING TO MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE. AND ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES FOR A FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS IN A WHEELCHAIR AND HE'S THREE HUNDRED OVER THREE HUNDRED POUNDS HE NEEDED THE CARE GIVER AFTER HIS QUIT ON A FRIDAY NIGHT AT. FOUR THIRTY IN THE AFTERNOON WITH BOTH THE COME ON THE WEEKEND. AND- I CALLED ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES AND I WAS TOLD AT TWO MINUTES TO BUY BY ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES STAFF IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THAT IF HE NEEDED HELP TO TELL HIM TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. AND THAT THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY LISTS ARE THE SAME LIST THAT THE- ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES USE AND THERE IS A DEFICIENCY. THERE BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ANY ANY PROVIDERS OUT THERE IN THE LIST THAT YOU GET FROM THE- PUBLIC AUTHORITY OURSELVES THAT STANDARD. AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE. OUT THERE TO HELP THOSE WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES. THEY'RE ALL OVER INSTEAD PROMISE THE PROMISE THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BUILD LIVE. ON OUR OWN IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE COMMUNITY. IS EIGHT IS NOTHING BUT A GREEN AND MOST OF US WOULD LIKE TO LIVE. NORMAL PRODUCTIVE MEANINGFUL FULFILLING LIVES. WITHOUT A MEDICAL MODEL LAND IN APPROACH BUT WE'RE NOT BEING GIVEN THAT BECAUSE THERE'S NO WORK FORCE FOR AT THE HIGHER. SO IN MY CASE I'M AN ELECTRIC WHEELCHAIR BEEN IN A WHEELCHAIR SINCE AGE SIX. I HAVE A SEVERE DISABILITY I LIVE IN EL GROW OLD AND IF I EVEN IF MY HOUSE IS FULLY ACCEPTABLE. AND WHAT GOOD IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T FIND ANY PROVIDERS TO WORK FOR YOU. SO IT'S CONSENSUAL THAT YOU START INCENTIVIZING THESE JOBS SO THAT THERE'S PROVIDERS- THAT YOU'RE PAYING DECENT WAGES THEY GOT DECENT HEALTH INSURANCE VETERANS SICK LEAVE VACATION AND AN UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR THOSE INCLUDING FAMILY MEMBERS WHEN A RECIPIENT DIES ALL THE SUDDEN THEY'RE MONEY DRIED UP AND THEY HAVE A MORTGAGE TO PAY. IN SOME CASES. THESE THINGS ARE WRONG. AND YET I HEARD FROM AN ADVOCATE TODAY I GOT AN EMAIL SAID IN A DAY OR TWO THERE'S A BILL FOR MAKING IT MORE EASY FOR PEOPLE TO GET ASSISTED SUICIDE. SO WHAT APPROACH ARE WE TAKING WE'RE TAKING AN APPROACH THAT SAYS IT'S OKAY DID NOT A WE DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY. AND IT'S RIDICULOUS IT IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG AND- WHAT WE NEED IS. YOU TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES RESTORED 27% I AGENTS THAT. HI I SENT IN AN EMAIL TODAY WITH FORTY SEVEN SIGNATURES ON THE ON THE EMAIL- ADDITIONALLY- I AGREE WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT WHAT IT WHAT IT SAYS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG.
