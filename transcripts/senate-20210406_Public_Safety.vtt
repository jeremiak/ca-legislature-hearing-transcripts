00:34:46.617 --> 00:34:49.120
THAT FOR EXAMPLE TO ARKANSAS

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:52.356
AND MISSISSIPPI. ONLY 15% OF

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:54.358
THEIR PRISON POPULATION HAS

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:56.594
LICENSES AND IF YOU THINK WELL

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:57.895
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE MORE OF

00:34:57.962 --> 00:34:59.163
THEM HAVE BEEN GIVEN A DEATH

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.933
SENTENCE NO CALIFORNIA EXCEEDS

00:35:01.999 --> 00:35:03.734
BOTH OF THOSE STATES IN TERMS

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:07.171
OF. THE- PROVIDING OF A DEATH

00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.373
SENTENCE SO. JUST FROM A

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.043
PROPORTIONALITY WE HAVE FAR

00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:15.112
MORE PEOPLE. WHO WE SENTENCED

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:17.148
FOR LIFE. NOW OR THE CRIME

00:35:17.215 --> 00:35:19.650
RATES IN TERMS OF THE MOST

00:35:19.717 --> 00:35:21.953
HEINOUS CRIMES WORST IN OUR

00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:25.056
STATE THAN THOSE STATES NO. SO

00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:27.425
WHY IS IT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:30.328
MORE PEOPLE SERVING LIFE.

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:33.130
BECAUSE OF EXTREME SENTENCING

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:34.966
THAT NOT ONLY THE LEGISLATURE

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:38.736
BUT ALSO VOTERS ENACTED. DURING

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:39.770
BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE A

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:41.606
HIGH PROFILE CRIME WHICH IS

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:44.809
REALLY AWFUL. AND IT'S

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:46.911
PUBLICIZED AGREED DEAL SOMEONE

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:48.880
SEIZES UPON THAT DOESN'T

00:35:48.946 --> 00:35:52.783
INITIATIVE AND THEN WE VOTERS

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.318
PASS WITHOUT REALIZING THE

00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:57.355
IMPLICATIONS. AND THE BROAD

00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:59.190
SWATH OF THE POPULATION THAT WE

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:00.825
ARE THEN AFFECTING BY SUCH A

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:02.927
SENTENCE. NOW FREE FACTORED

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:05.062
JUVENILES CALIFORNIA'S MADE

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:07.932
SOME REFORMS FOR CALIFORNIA HAD

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:11.202
BY FAR THE HIGHEST NUMBER BOTH

00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:13.371
RON NUMBER AND PERCENT OF

00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:15.740
JUVENILES THAT WERE GIVEN A

00:36:15.806 --> 00:36:17.508
LIFE SENTENCE EXCEEDING

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:21.679
LOUISIANA TEXAS AND GEORGIA.

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:23.447
NOW IN THIS THERE ARE

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:24.982
APPROPRIATE TIMES FOR A LIFE

00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:27.184
SENTENCE BUT I THINK THAT THIS

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:30.087
REFORM IS VERY REASONABLE AND

00:36:30.154 --> 00:36:32.790
I'M IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME FOR

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:34.725
EXAMPLE THAT THE DA'S SUPPOSE

00:36:34.792 --> 00:36:38.563
HOWEVER. WHAT BENEFIT HAS IT

00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:41.566
HAD TO CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THAT

00:36:41.632 --> 00:36:43.734
PERCENT OF PEOPLE 40% OF OUR

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.670
INCARCERATED POPULATION SERVE A

00:36:45.736 --> 00:36:48.539
LIFE SENTENCE IT'S EXTREMELY

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:50.908
EXPENSIVE FOR US EXTREMELY. AND

00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:54.579
VERY LITTLE BENEFIT AND AGAIN

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:56.514
IT IS APPROPRIATE IN THE MOST

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:59.116
HEINOUS CRIMES AND FOR PEOPLE

00:36:59.183 --> 00:37:00.785
WITH INTENT TO COMMIT MURDER

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:03.154
POTENTIALLY TO SERVE A LIFE

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.723
SENTENCE HOWEVER WITH THE BILL

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.392
BEFORE US DOES IS ALLOW THERE

00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:10.695
TO BE A DISTINCTION. THAT YOU

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:13.297
MAY STILL GET A VERY LONG SENSE

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:15.266
BUT THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE GIVEN

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:18.603
LIFE UNLESS YOU MET CERTAIN.

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:23.674
CRITERIA NOW. AGAIN WHY THE

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:26.177
DAS FEEL THAT THEY NEED TO

00:37:26.243 --> 00:37:29.113
HAVE THE ABILITY TO GIVE A LIFE

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.250
WITHOUT PAROLE FOR. THE PEOPLE

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:34.051
WHO I MEAN THERE'S FIRST DEGREE

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:36.487
MURDER CASES THAT GET LESS OF A

00:37:36.554 --> 00:37:39.290
SENTENCE THEN THIS THEN THE

00:37:39.357 --> 00:37:41.759
CORRECTION THAT THE SENATORS

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:44.862
PROPOSED TO US- THIS BILL IS

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.297
GOING TO BE HARD BECAUSE IT'S A

00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:47.765
TWO THIRDS VOTE BECAUSE IT WAS

00:37:47.832 --> 00:37:49.133
DONE BY AN INITIATIVE IN WHICH

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.068
REQUIRES TWO THIRDS BECAUSE FOR

00:37:51.135 --> 00:37:53.571
US TO FIX. SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:55.439
PASSED BY INITIATIVE REQUIRES

00:37:55.506 --> 00:37:57.408
TWO THIRDS BUT I HOPE THAT WERE

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:59.477
AT THE PLACE WHERE WE CAN

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:03.614
APPRECIATE. THAT LICENSES WHILE

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:05.583
THEY SERVE A PURPOSE AND ARE

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:08.853
APPROPRIATE OR NOT APPROPRIATE.

00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:12.289
ACTUALLY 440% OF OUR OVER A

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:13.858
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN

00:38:13.924 --> 00:38:16.594
PRISON IN CALIFORNIA. SO I

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:18.696
APPRECIATE YOUR- BRINGING THE

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:21.732
BILL. AND I HOPE THAT WE ARE

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:23.634
ABLE I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES ARE

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:26.804
ABLE TO. SEE THE WISDOM OF

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:29.206
MAKING THIS CORRECTION THIS

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:29.707
DOES NOT ELIMINATE LIFE

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:32.610
SENTENCES. AND CERTAINLY THERE

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:34.845
ARE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT FEEL THAT

00:38:34.912 --> 00:38:36.247
THEY COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS

00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:38.315
BUT WHO WON'T BECAUSE IT IS

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:41.452
NARROWLY CRAFTED. BUT AGAIN I

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:41.952
APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:45.256

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:49.894
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR

SENATOR OF AYE SURE OTRO BOOK.

DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION AB WITH

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.002
REGARDS AND I'M NOT SURE IF-

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:59.704
SENATOR CORTESE CAN ANSWER THIS

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.139
OR PERHAPS- WITH THE CHAIRS

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:05.743
PERMISSION- SENATOR SKINNER BUT

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.745
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:10.314
PUBLIC WHO VOTED FOR THIS

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:13.184
INITIATIVE- AND NOW WE ARE

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.052
GOING TO BE VOTING ON THE

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.587
POSSIBILITY OF OVERTURNING

00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:19.023

HOW DO YOU ANSWER TO THE TO THE

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.930
BORDERS OF CALIFORNIA. FIVE I

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:27.631
THINK THE WAY WE ANSWERED TO

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:29.834
THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA IS-

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.603
PRECISELY. HOW CENTER SKINNER

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.138
JUST EXPLAIN THIS TO THE

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:36.340
SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN- THAT

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:40.478
THE VOTERS. WITH GOOD INTENTION-

00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:43.981
PASSES REFERENDUM- WITHOUT

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:45.049
KNOWING WHAT THE OUTCOMES WOULD

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:47.752
BE- WOULD NOT WOULD NOT KNOW

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:49.820
WHAT THE EVOLUTION WOULD BE OF

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.489
THE LEGISLATURE'S OWN EFFORTS

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:53.424
TO REFORM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM A

00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:56.894
TO THIS POINT- AND- THE TWO

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:58.529
THIRDS REQUIREMENT OF THIS

00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:00.064
LEGISLATURE WAS PUT IN AS A

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:04.034
SAFEGUARD- TO ANY CHANGES THAT

00:40:04.101 --> 00:40:04.502
WOULD BE MADE TO THE

00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:08.105
REFERENDUM- AND I TO. OF COURSE

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:10.341
IMPRESSING ON THAT THIS IS

00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:12.510
ENOUGH OF A PROBLEM- THAT THE

00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:14.945
TWO THIRDS A REQUIREMENT

00:40:15.012 --> 00:40:16.747
SHOULD. BE MET IN THIS

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:19.283
LEGISLATURE IF IT'S NOT- THEN

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.252
THE ANSWER TO THE VOTERS IS

00:40:21.318 --> 00:40:24.688
GOING TO BE- WE CAN'T WE CAN'T

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:27.825
CHANGE WHAT YOU ENACTED INTO

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:31.529
LAW BY REFERENDUM- IT THIS DOES

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:33.063
NOT TAKE AWAY SPECIAL

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:36.500
CIRCUMSTANCES- I THINK A LITTLE

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:38.135
BIT OF THE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:39.904
MAY HAVE BEEN MISLEADING FOR

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.972
EXAMPLE THE EXAMPLE THAT I

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:43.507
HEARD IF I WAS HEARING IT RIGHT

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:45.209
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. WHICH

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:47.044
INSTRUCTION TO THE BILL IS

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:48.312
CLEARLY CALLED OUT OF SPECIAL

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:50.014
CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOT ONLY

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:50.948
CALLED ON THE SPECIAL

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:52.116
CIRCUMSTANCES BUT WOULD STILL

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:54.485
REQUIRE LOCK. OR THE DEATH

00:40:54.552 --> 00:40:57.321
PENALTY SIMPLY BY THE ASSERTION

00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:59.657
OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. IN IN

00:40:59.723 --> 00:41:03.027
THE IN THE PROSECUTION SO. MUCH

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:08.032
OF WHAT THE VOTERS ENACTED HIS

00:41:08.098 --> 00:41:09.733
STANCE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.838
STANDS- BUT I DO BELIEVE IF WE

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:15.739
WENT BACK TO THE VOTERS TODAY

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.942
AND ASKED THE FLIP QUESTION-

00:41:18.008 --> 00:41:21.412
WOULD WAS IT YOUR EXPECTATION.

00:41:21.478 --> 00:41:23.480
THAT THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'VE

00:41:23.547 --> 00:41:24.882
GOTTEN FROM THIS BILL WOULD BE

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:27.685
AS THEY ARE THE TWO THIRDS OF

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:31.255
THOSE. CONVICTED UNDER SPECIAL

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:33.324
CIRCUMSTANCES I'LL WALK OR

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:34.758
DEATH PENALTY TWO THIRDS OF

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:36.393
THOSE WILL DIE IN PRISON ONE

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.494
WAY OR THE OTHER WHO WILL NOT

00:41:37.561 --> 00:41:38.462
COME OUT OF PRISON OTHER THAN

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:40.531
IN A CASKET. TWO THIRDS OF

00:41:40.598 --> 00:41:42.399
THOSE WILL BE PEOPLE OF COLOR.

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:43.601
TWO THIRDS OF THOSE WILL BE

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:46.370
UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:47.171
THE AVERAGE AGE WILL BE

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:49.807
NINETEEN- WE HAVE TO STEP IN IN

00:41:49.874 --> 00:41:53.878
DISMANTLE. WHATEVER IT IS THAT

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:56.347
THAT IS CREATING THOSE OUTCOMES

00:41:56.413 --> 00:41:58.949
I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS INTO

00:41:59.016 --> 00:41:59.483
THE VOTERS TO CREATE THOSE

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.453
OUTCOMES. OTHERWISE THE

00:42:02.519 --> 00:42:05.055
REFERENDUM WOULD HAVE BEEN.

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:06.457
UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN ALL

00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:09.560
LIKELIHOOD CERTAINLY RACIST- ON

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:12.162
ITS FACE BUT NOW WE KNOW OF

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:14.331
WHAT THE ACTUAL OUTCOMES OF

00:42:14.398 --> 00:42:15.799
THIS LAW OR WE HAVE THE WE HAVE

00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:19.003
THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT ACTUAL

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:22.006
OUTCOMES ACTUAL DATA- YEAH WE

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:23.641
HAVE A PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE

00:42:23.707 --> 00:42:24.208
RIGHT NOW AND I THINK IT'S

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:28.746
PROBABLY. THE MOST COMPELLING-

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:31.115
THE MOST COMPELLING REASON TO

00:42:31.181 --> 00:42:33.417
CORRECT. A WHAT I THINK SENATOR

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:35.552
SKINNER'S ALLUDING TO A

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:38.722
POINTING OUT. HIS SOMETHING

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:40.024
THAT ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:43.427
CORRECTED BECAUSE OF HER FINE

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:44.695
WORK ON SB FOURTEEN THIRTY

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:50.734
SEVEN- WE WE'VE ALREADY IT IN

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:53.037
ESSENCE CORRECTED A FLAW IN THE

00:42:53.103 --> 00:42:58.108
FELONY MURDER. DR IN CALIFORNIA

00:42:58.175 --> 00:43:00.244
BUT WE HAVEN'T CORRECTED THE

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:01.478
SAME FOR IN SPECIAL

00:43:01.545 --> 00:43:04.448
CIRCUMSTANCES. SO WE HAVE A

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:06.784
PECULIAR SCENARIO. PERSONS WHO

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.018
WERE NOT SENTENCED TO L. WALKER

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:11.488
DEF- ARE ABLE TO PETITION

00:43:11.555 --> 00:43:13.257
COURTS FOR RELIEF BY SHOWING

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:15.292
THAT THEY NEVER INTENDED TO

PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW NO LONGER

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:21.872
INCARCERATED BECAUSE THE

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:22.806
GOVERNOR GAVE THEM A

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:25.609
COMMUTATION TO A GOVERNOR

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.444
LOOKED AND THOUGHT OUT OKAY

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:30.080
THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE THAT

THEY HAD THIS LIFE SENTENCE.

00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:32.449
AND ANOTHER REASON THAT I

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:36.720
WANTED TO- EXPRESS IN EFFECT

00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:38.121
THE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL IS

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:40.624
THAT WHILE I APPRECIATE AND

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:41.758
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.794
GOVERNORS TO HAVE SUCH A RULE I

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.462
DON'T THINK A PERSON

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:46.797
CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD BE

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:49.266
DEPENDENT SOLELY AND ONLY ON

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:50.467
THE POWER OF A GOVERNOR TO

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:52.803
COMMUTE. A SENTENCE ESPECIALLY

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:56.406
WHEN WE HAVE 40% OF OUR PRISON

00:47:56.473 --> 00:47:58.275
POPULATION WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:47:58.342 --> 00:48:00.444
THOUSAND PEOPLE FOR SO 40% OF

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.413
THAT IS- YOU DO THE MATH OF

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.282
ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:06.850
SERVING LIFE SENTENCES THERE'S

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:09.786
NO WAY ANY GOVERNOR CAN REVIEW

00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:11.888
THAT LEVEL OF POPULATION TO

00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:14.958
DETERMINE WHETHER. THEY WERE

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:17.060
APPROPRIATELY SENTENCED SO WHAT

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:19.363
THIS BILL DOES THIS DOES NOT

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:22.499

BE ABLE TO PETITION THE COURT.

00:48:30.974 --> 00:48:32.309
AND THE COURT THEN TO LOOK AT

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:33.977
THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ALLOWS

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:35.712
THE DA'S TO COME FORWARD THE

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:37.547
PROSECUTOR IT ALLOWS VICTIMS TO

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:31.941
FOR CA CJ ON THE PHONE. AND

01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:37.546
THEN- MY LAST QUESTION IS JUST-

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.849
AS I WAS READING THROUGH THE

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:42.618
BILL- AND THE ANALYSIS. I WAS

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:48.691
WONDERING IF THERE IS ANY-

01:08:48.757 --> 01:08:51.393
CONSIDERATION THAT IS GIVEN

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.862
BECAUSE I ALSO HEARD THAT IT'S

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:54.730
NOT REQUIRED IT IS NOT

01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:56.131
MANDATORY BUT IT IS AN OPTION

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:59.001
IT IS ANOTHER TOOL- THAT JUDGES

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:02.404
HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL BUT I

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.507
KNOW THAT IN MANY INSTANCES NOT

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:07.009
IN ALL THOSE THAT ARE INVOLVED

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:11.146
IN THIS KIND OF TRAFFICKING-

01:09:11.213 --> 01:09:12.481
ARE ALSO SORT OF VICTIMS ARE

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:15.117
HAVE BEEN. VICTIMIZED BY THE

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:17.052
SAME KIND OF BEHAVIOR AND

01:09:17.119 --> 01:09:19.054
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE PAST- IT'S

01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:20.623
ALMOST ANALOGOUS TO CHILD

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:23.092
SOLDIERS WHO ARE YOU KNOW

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:23.659
PARTICIPATING IN CRIMINAL

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.528
ACTIVITY AND- ARE CURRENTLY

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.396
THEMSELVES BEING VICTIMIZED. SO

01:09:27.463 --> 01:09:30.032
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW- IF THERE'S

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:33.602
ANY. REMEDY OF CONSIDERATION

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:36.405
FOR SITUATIONS LIKE THE ACT OR

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:38.541
IS IT SORT OF- INFERRED BY THE

01:09:38.607 --> 01:09:41.043
FACT THAT- THIS IS AN OPTION AT

01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:43.846
THE DISPOSAL RATHER THAN

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:46.115
SOMETHING THAT IS- MANDATORY IF

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:49.051
THAT MAKES SENSE. SO JUST A

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.953
QUESTION- IS YOUR YOUR

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:55.224
REFERENCE TO THAT THE ACCUSED

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:58.861
OR TO THE VICTIM THE ACCUSED.

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:02.631
I'M THIS THIS- THIS DOESN'T

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:07.536
CHANGE THE RELATIONSHIPS- OR OR

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:12.041
MAKE ANY- ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:14.510
ACCUSED- THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:17.446
THAT'LL BE PART OF I'M ASSUMING

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:19.882
A CRIMINAL CASE WHERE- IF

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:21.784
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A DEFENSE

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:23.719
BOB A POSSIBLE DEFENSE BOB YOU

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:24.954
KNOW YEAH I WAS A VICTIM OF

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.756
THIS ONCE AND SO THAT'S WHY I

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:28.891
GOT INVOLVED IN IT- CERTAINLY

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:30.459
THAT. I'VE I'VE NEVER HEARD

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:32.361
THAT USE BUT I'M I'M I'M I'M

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:34.496
ASSUMING THAT IT A CREATIVE-

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:35.831
DEFENSE ATTORNEY COULD USE THAT

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:38.167
WITH THIS HAS TO DO WITH IS THE

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:40.736
CRIMINAL CASE AS IT COMES INTO

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:44.873

THE JUDGE TO UNDERSTAND THAT B.

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:52.181
THAT THERE'S A PROCESS WHERE I

01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:53.882
THE JUDGE CAN ORDER A

01:10:53.949 --> 01:10:56.785

OUTCOME OF THE CRIMINAL CASE.

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.089

SCHOOL AT USC- AND ALSO SOME

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:28.049
CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAD WITH

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:29.150
STUDENTS A FEW WEEKS AGO FROM

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:31.786
THAT. SAME SCHOOL WHO TALKED

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:34.222
ABOUT- THE CONCERNS THAT THEY

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:37.525
HAVE- REGARDING THE

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:39.694
RELATIONSHIP. THAT THE SCHOOL

01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:41.996
HAS DEVELOPED WITH THE

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:43.331
NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES AND

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:45.533
COMMUNITY MEMBERS- AND HOW

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.769
OFTEN TIMES FOLKS WHO LIVE IN

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:49.737
THE NEIGHBORING AREA OF SOUTH

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:54.108
LA- ARE. EITHER INTIMIDATED OR

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:56.544
HARASSED FOR TREATED IN A WAY

01:26:56.611 --> 01:27:00.081
THAT SEEMS ON KIND BY STUDENTS-

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:04.052
OF THE- LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:06.220
ON THE SCHOOL. AND IT MADE ME

01:27:06.287 --> 01:27:08.122
THINK OF WHEN I WAS GOING TO

01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:10.925
SCHOOL. AND RECOGNIZING THAT IT

01:27:10.992 --> 01:27:13.094
IS A SHORT CUT FOR MANY FOLKS

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:15.463
WHO LIVE IN SOUTH LA- INSTEAD

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:16.831
OF GOING AROUND THE ENTIRE

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.666
CAMPUS OFTENTIMES COMMUNITY

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:20.768
MEMBERS WOULD WALK THROUGH. BUT

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:22.337
IT WAS ALSO EVIDENT THAT THEY

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:23.871
READ THEIR BEING PROFILED OR

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:25.406
SOMEONE WAS DETERMINING THAT

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:26.307
THEY WERE NOT STUDENTS AT THE

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:29.544
SCHOOL- AND THEY WOULD BE-

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:33.514
STOPPED APPREHENDED- AND DID

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.783
TOLD TO GET OFF THE CAMPUS- BY

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:38.086
CAMPUS POLICE. AND SO I WAS

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:44.392
JUST WONDERING- WHEN. WHAT THIS

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:47.395
BILL WOULD DO- IN THOSE

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:51.466
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR- THOSE. KINDS

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:54.602
OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS- BECAUSE

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:55.903
WHILE I AGREE STUDENTS SHOULD

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:58.239
BE PENALIZED FOR WHERE THEY GO

01:27:58.306 --> 01:27:59.340
TO SCHOOL I ALSO AGREE THAT

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:00.975
COMMUNITY MEMBERS SHOULD BE

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:01.542
PENALIZED FOR WHERE SCHOOLS

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:05.113
BEEN BUILT- AND HOW WE DEVELOP.

01:28:05.179 --> 01:28:06.848
RIGHTEOUS RELATIONSHIPS ARE HOW

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:08.249
SCHOOLS DEVELOP RIGHT JUST

01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:09.183
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:10.685
NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES IS AS

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:12.253
IMPORTANT AS MAKING SURE THAT

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.822
THOSE THAT LIVE OR WORK OR ARE

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:16.324
EDUCATED ON THE SCHOOL CAMPUSES

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:18.593
ARE ALSO PROTECTED. SO I JUST

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.361
WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU TO MAKE

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:22.797
SURE THAT THIS LAW WASN'T GOING

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:24.198
TO DISPROPORTIONATELY CREATE

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:25.767
OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITY

01:28:25.833 --> 01:28:26.968
MEMBERS ARE FOLKS THAT ARE

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:28.803
DEEMED YOU KNOW INAPPROPRIATE

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:33.207
TO BE ON CAMPUS- FROM BEING-

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:34.642
UNDULY HARASSED. I THINK IT'S A

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:36.377
IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:39.047
CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THAT EVERY

01:28:39.113 --> 01:28:40.948
CAMPUS SHOULD BE COGNISANT OF-

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:42.517
YOU KNOW COLLEGE CAMPUSES

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:43.685
TRADITIONALLY ARE WELCOMING

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:46.320
PLACES THEY HAVE. PUBLIC EVENTS

01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:47.388
IN THERE ARE GALLERIES THEY

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:49.290
HAVE THEATER PRODUCTIONS-

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:51.159
YOU'RE RIGHT PEOPLE DO YOU

01:28:51.225 --> 01:28:53.161
SHORT CUTS ACROSS CAMPUSES I

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:54.295
DON'T THINK THAT'S THE INTENT

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:56.431
OF THIS BILL AT ALL AND I THINK

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:58.900
YOUR COMMENTS FOR THE- AICC YOU

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:00.201
FOLKS WHO ARE LISTENING SHOULD

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:01.869
TAKE IT TO HEART. TO MAKE SURE

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:03.538
THAT THOSE CAMPUSES DON'T

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:07.241
UNDULY- PROFILE OR INTIMIDATE

01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:08.943
NEIGHBORHOOD FOLKS THIS BILL IS

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.845
INTENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:29:10.912 --> 01:29:13.347
CAUSING HARM OR POTENTIAL HARM

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:16.217
ON A CAMPUS THAT SOMEHOW MOSTLY

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:17.185
ARE RELATED TO THAT CAMPUS

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:18.886
WHETHER THAT'S A- DISGRUNTLED

01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:20.421
EMPLOYEE WHETHER THAT'S

01:29:20.488 --> 01:29:22.256
SOMEBODY WHO'S MADE THREATS.

01:29:22.323 --> 01:29:25.126
THIS GIVES PRIVATE COLLEGES THE

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.861
SAME TOOLS THAT A PUBLIC

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:28.329
UNIVERSITY HAS TO DEAL WITH

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:29.831
THOSE ISSUES SO THAT'S WHAT THE

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:31.466
INTENT OF THIS BILL IS BUT I

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:33.534
THINK YOUR QUESTION IS TOTALLY

01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:35.570
GERMANE TO THE CAMPUS LIFE AN

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:36.204
ATMOSPHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:38.005
DYNAMICS AND- YOU KNOW IS A

01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:41.909
GOOD. IS A GOOD STATEMENT TO

01:29:41.976 --> 01:29:42.543
HAVE THOSE COLLEGES BE THINKING

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:44.746
ABOUT. I WAS PART OF. THE DAY

01:29:44.812 --> 01:29:47.448
AND- HI. I WOULD THINK YOU

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:48.483
MISTER CHAIR THAT IN MANY

01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:49.717
INSTANCES AND I CAN THINK OF A

01:29:49.784 --> 01:29:52.186
NUMBER OF COLLEGES- THAT ARE

01:29:52.253 --> 01:29:53.855
WELL REGARDED WHERE TUITION IS

01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:56.090
INCREDIBLY HIGH. THEY HAVE VERY

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:57.825
STRONG ALUMNI RELATIONS AND

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:59.360
FOLKS GOOD SEND THEIR KIDS

01:29:59.427 --> 01:30:00.294
THERE BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:02.029
EXPECTING M. S. STELLAR

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:04.232
EDUCATION AND SAFETY. OFTEN

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:07.869
HAPPEN TO BE UP IN. LOWER

01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:09.270
INCOME COMMUNITIES AND IS

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:10.438
REALLY BECAUSE OF AL YOU OF THE

01:30:10.505 --> 01:30:13.674
LAND WAS SO LOW- YOU KNOW LONG

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:17.478
TIME AGO. AND SO. IT'S WHILE WE

01:30:17.545 --> 01:30:18.980
UNDERSTAND THAT FOLKS ARE THERE

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:19.814
YOU KNOW TO GET A GOOD

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:21.449
EDUCATION AND IT HAPPENS TO BE

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:23.251
A GREAT SCHOOL LOCATED IN I'M

01:30:23.317 --> 01:30:25.620
AN INTERESTING URBAN SPACE IT

01:30:25.686 --> 01:30:27.421
IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:28.623
THAT THEY STILL HAVE A

01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:30.925
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENGAGE AND TO

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:33.161
NOT PROFILE- AND TO NOT USE

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:35.363
THIS AS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL- TO

01:30:35.429 --> 01:30:37.198
MAKE COMMUNITY MEMBERS FEEL

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:39.467
DISCONNECTED- FROM A SCHOOL

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:41.536
THAT HOPEFULLY WOULD WANT TO-

01:30:41.602 --> 01:30:43.204
YOU KNOW ADMIT THEM WHEN

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:44.939
THEY'RE OF AGE TO GO TO THAT

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:47.008
SCHOOL OR EVEN WORK THERE SO I

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:47.909
JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:50.444
BECAUSE- IT IT MADE ME THINK OF

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:51.913
CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:53.981

READ THE SYNOPSIS OF THE BILL

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:12.200
IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME TO ASK A

01:31:12.266 --> 01:31:15.903
QUESTION THAT- THAT MS COM

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:20.208
ORDERS ARE SENATOR. BASED AND-

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:21.642
SO I GUESS I WOULD PUT IT A

01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:23.444
DIFFERENT WAY AND ASK THE

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:27.281
AUTHOR WOOD THIS. WHEN I READ

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:28.583
IT I WAS LIKE OKAY THIS IS JUST

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:31.085
SAW. ALLOWING THE BENEFIT THAT

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.721
OTHER. COLLEGE CAMPUSES HALF

01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:35.456
BUT- I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:39.293
WHETHER THIS. WOULD ALLOW FOR

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.863
CAMPUS FOR EXAMPLE. TO IN

01:31:41.929 --> 01:31:45.333
EFFECT CLOSE ITSELF OFF IN

01:31:45.399 --> 01:31:48.703
OTHER WORDS ENACT A RULE SUCH

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:51.606
THAT ONLY. STUDENTS REGISTERED

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:55.276
STUDENTS AND- OUR CAMPUS STAFF

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:57.945
WITH ID WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE

01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:00.414
THROUGH A CAMPUS AND THE REASON

01:32:00.481 --> 01:32:03.784
I ASK IS INTERESTINGLY- THE

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:06.020
SENATORS AT. I GAVE THE EXAMPLE

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:08.923
OF U. S. C. AND WE'RE IT

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:11.158
SITUATED- I CAN GIVE THE

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:12.693
EXAMPLE OF THE COLLEGE IN MY

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.228
OWN TOWN UC BERKELEY WHICH

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:17.865
LITERALLY. UC BERKELEY IS AT

01:32:17.932 --> 01:32:20.668
TELEGRAPH AVENUE ENDS RIGHT UC

01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:23.771
BERKELEY. AND IN EFFECT IF YOU

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:25.506
WERE WALKING ACROSS THE CAMPUS

01:32:25.573 --> 01:32:27.441
IT BEGINS AGAIN THOUGH NOT

01:32:27.508 --> 01:32:29.443
UNDER THE SAME NAME BUT UNDER

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:31.412
THE NAME EUCLID AVENUE. ACROSS

01:32:31.479 --> 01:32:34.248
THE CAMPUS AND- THE ONLY WAY IF

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:36.984
YOU'RE WALKING TO GET TO THOSE

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:38.319
SPOTS QUICKLY IS TO GO THROUGH

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:39.954
THE CAMPUS YOU YOU REALLY HAVE

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:41.122
OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO

01:32:41.188 --> 01:32:43.524
MANY MANY MANY BLOCKS OUT OF

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:46.260
YOUR WAY. AND INTERESTINGLY

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:48.696
DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:51.232
BECAUSE MOST PEDESTRIANS IN

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:54.268
BERKELEY USE THAT ROUTE. THE

01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:56.504
DURING THE PANDEMIC THE CAMPUS.

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.005
BASICALLY SAID WELL THEY'RE

01:32:58.072 --> 01:32:59.640
GOING TO CLOSE IT OFF SO THAT

01:32:59.707 --> 01:33:01.509
NO PUBLIC COULD WALK THROUGH.

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:03.377
AND THERE WAS A HUGE UPROAR IN

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:05.079
MY COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF COURSE

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:07.181
THAT WOULD MAKE IT REALLY HARD

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:09.984
TO GET. TO IT I MEAN THERE IT'S

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:12.553
A SHOPPING DISTRICT IN SUCH- SO

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.755
THE UNIVERSITY PULLED BACK BUT

01:33:14.822 --> 01:33:16.724
I'M JUST WONDERING WOOD. WITH

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.626
THIS BILL ALLOW SUCH PROVISION

01:33:18.693 --> 01:33:20.127
BECAUSE I DID NOT LOOK AT IT

01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:22.396
FROM THAT LEADS WHY I THINK WE

01:33:22.463 --> 01:33:24.098
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT THE

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:27.068
PICNIC IS DIFFERENT. THAN YOU

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:29.170
KNOW NORMAL ACTIVITY AND

01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:30.871
COLLEGE CAMPUSES UNDER NORMAL

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:33.007
ACTIVITY HAVE SPORTING EVENTS-

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:35.076
WHICH THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO

01:33:35.142 --> 01:33:36.444
THEY HAVE AS I SAID THEATER

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:38.813
PRODUCTIONS- THEY HAVE

01:33:38.879 --> 01:33:40.915
FACILITIES THEY HAVE. THE YOU

01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:42.049
KNOW TRADITIONALLY COLLEGE

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:44.018
CAMPUSES HAVE A VERY STRONG

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:46.253
PUBLIC PRESENCE WITH THIS BILL

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.255
IS DESIGNED TO DO IS TO DEAL

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:49.824
WITH THAT PERSON WHO WAS BEING

01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:51.692
DISRUPTIVE ON A CAMPUS WHO

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:54.562
POSES A THREAT. TO STUDENTS ON

01:33:54.628 --> 01:33:55.963
THAT CAMPUS AND I WOULD ARGUE

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:57.732
THAT MANY OF THE PRIVATE

01:33:57.798 --> 01:33:58.399
COLLEGES ARE ACTUALLY MORE

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:00.835
DIVERSE. STUDENT POPULATIONS

01:34:00.901 --> 01:34:02.069
UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR PUBLIC

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:03.871
UNIVERSITY SO THIS IS

01:34:03.938 --> 01:34:05.806
PROTECTING ALL STUDENTS FROM

01:34:05.873 --> 01:34:07.942
THAT POTENTIAL HARMFUL ACT IT'S

01:34:08.009 --> 01:34:10.077
NOT GIVING THEM THE TOOLS TO

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:12.480
BORDER. THEIR COLLEGE CAMPUSES

01:34:12.546 --> 01:34:13.848
FROM THE PUBLIC INTERACTION

01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:17.418
WHICH. IS NOT A NORMAL COURSE

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:18.452
OF EVENTS ON DIFFICULT CAMPUSES.

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:19.086
AND SO I THINK THAT'S A WE HAVE

01:34:19.153 --> 01:34:20.955
TO AT AND FOR EXAMPLE BERKELEY

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:22.056
HAS THE TOOLS WERE STANFORD

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:24.492
DOESN'T. CALCULATE CAL STATE LA

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:27.428
HAS THE TOOL WHERE USC DOESN'T

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:28.829
THIS IS JUST PROVIDING PUBLIC

01:34:28.896 --> 01:34:30.431
UNIVERSITIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:33.034
MAKE THEIR STUDENTS SAFE. FROM

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.736
THAT OF ABERRATION. PERSON WHO

01:34:35.803 --> 01:34:38.439
POSES OF IMMINENT THREAT TO THE

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:40.174
WELFARE OF THOSE STUDENTS UNDER

01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:41.842
THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT PERSON

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:43.277
CAN KEEP COMING BACK AD

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:46.680
INFINITUM. AND POTENTIALLY YOU

01:34:46.747 --> 01:34:48.582
KNOW WITH A WEAPON. AND HURT

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:49.650
SOMEBODY AND SO THAT'S WHAT

01:34:49.717 --> 01:34:52.486
THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO DO IT'S

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:53.020
NOT SEEKING TO PUT A WALL

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:56.991
AROUND CAMPUS. THANK YOU ANY

RELATES TO- USC IN THE

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:09.370
SURROUNDING AREAS AND JUST

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:11.272
USING THAT AS AN EXAMPLE AND

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:13.207
YOUR RESPONSE WAS LESS THE

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:15.109

02:16:41.726 --> 02:16:44.229
WORLD BUT PEOPLE USE DRUGS WE

02:16:44.296 --> 02:16:45.897
TRIED TO THROW PEOPLE IN JAIL

02:16:45.964 --> 02:16:48.366
THAT DIDN'T WORK. WE TRIED TO

02:16:48.433 --> 02:16:50.168
BERATE PEOPLE TO JUST SAY NO

02:16:50.235 --> 02:16:52.504
THAT DIDN'T WORK- AND

02:16:52.571 --> 02:16:54.539
RECOGNIZING THE REALITY THE

02:16:54.606 --> 02:16:56.541
IDEA IS HOW DO WE MAKE IT SO

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:58.910
THAT FEWER PEOPLE- OVERDOSE AND

02:16:58.977 --> 02:17:01.246
DIE SO THE FEWER PEOPLE GET HIV

02:17:01.313 --> 02:17:03.448
AND HEPATITIS. HOW DO WE MAKE

02:17:03.515 --> 02:17:05.116
IT TO THE PEOPLE ARE INJECTING

02:17:05.183 --> 02:17:06.918
ON THE SIDEWALK WHERE PEOPLE

02:17:06.985 --> 02:17:09.154
WALKING BY WITH THEIR CHILDREN-

02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:10.822
HOW DO WE HELP FACILITATE

02:17:10.889 --> 02:17:12.090
PEOPLE AND THE RECOVERY OF

02:17:12.157 --> 02:17:14.492
BALLOTS WHERE THEY WANT TO GO.

02:17:14.559 --> 02:17:15.460
AND THESE PROGRAMS HAVE SHOWN

02:17:15.527 --> 02:17:18.597
THAT THEY DO ALL OF THAT- AND

02:17:18.663 --> 02:17:20.131
SERVE I DON'T IT DOESN'T

02:17:20.198 --> 02:17:21.433
THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT IT

02:17:21.499 --> 02:17:23.835
INCREASES DRUG USE THERE IS AN

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:24.803
INDICATION THAT IT HELPS THE

02:17:24.869 --> 02:17:26.104
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE GET INTO

02:17:26.171 --> 02:17:28.139
RECOVERY. SO THEY USE DRUGS

02:17:28.206 --> 02:17:31.576
LESS OR MAYBE STOPPERS ARE LIKE.

02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:32.210
THE BILL DOES NOT MANDATE

02:17:32.277 --> 02:17:35.347
TREATMENT ONCE YOU'RE USING ARE

02:17:35.413 --> 02:17:37.415
YOUR ALLOWED TO USE WITHIN

02:17:37.482 --> 02:17:39.351
THESE FACILITIES RIGHT THE BILL

02:17:39.417 --> 02:17:41.786
IS NOT MANDATORY MEN- MANDATING

02:17:41.853 --> 02:17:45.056
TREATMENT- YOU KNOW IT IS IT IS

02:17:45.123 --> 02:17:49.260
NOT- FACTORS TYPICALLY- FOR

02:17:49.327 --> 02:17:52.664
MOST PEOPLE- THERE MIGHT BE.

02:17:52.731 --> 02:17:55.467
SOME EXTREME CASES WHERE- WHERE

02:17:55.533 --> 02:17:56.401
WHERE YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER

02:17:56.468 --> 02:17:57.836
DIFFERENT OPTIONS BUT FOR THE

02:17:57.902 --> 02:17:59.471
VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE USING

02:17:59.537 --> 02:18:02.173
DRUGS. MANDATING TREATMENT

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:03.642
ISN'T PROBABLY GOING TO HELP

02:18:03.708 --> 02:18:05.176
THEM WHAT DOES HELP THEM IS TO

02:18:05.243 --> 02:18:06.544
OFFER THEM RESOURCES AND

02:18:06.611 --> 02:18:10.248
SERVICES. AND TO STOP THEM FROM

02:18:10.315 --> 02:18:13.351
OVERDOSING AND DYING. YOU KNOW

02:18:13.418 --> 02:18:14.919
IT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE I

02:18:14.986 --> 02:18:18.123
AM VERY MUCH. INTERESTED IN

02:18:18.189 --> 02:18:20.091
BEHAVIOR HEALTH AS AN

02:18:20.158 --> 02:18:22.027
UNDERLYING FACTOR IN MANY OF

02:18:22.093 --> 02:18:24.429
THE ISSUES THAT WE SEE ACROSS

02:18:24.496 --> 02:18:28.500
MANY. DEMOGRAPHICS AND-

02:18:28.566 --> 02:18:31.269
AGENCIES ENTITIES I AM WHAT

02:18:31.336 --> 02:18:33.972
HAVE YOU IN IN- IN THE U. S.

02:18:34.039 --> 02:18:36.975
AND THE WORLD BUT SPECIFICALLY

02:18:37.042 --> 02:18:37.609
SPEAKING WITH REGARDS TO THE U.

02:18:37.676 --> 02:18:40.745
S. AND I LOOK AT THE ISSUES

02:18:40.812 --> 02:18:42.781
RIGHT NOW AND I AM LOOKING TO

02:18:42.847 --> 02:18:44.382
APPROACH ISSUES IN A WAY THAT.

02:18:44.449 --> 02:18:48.053
TRIED TO TREAT. THE PROBLEMS AT

02:18:48.119 --> 02:18:52.390
THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM AND.

02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:54.225
THIS AS YOU SAY IT IS A REALITY

02:18:54.292 --> 02:18:55.126
OF WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW

02:18:55.193 --> 02:18:57.429
UNFORTUNATELY AND I'M TRYING TO

02:18:57.495 --> 02:18:59.564
FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE- HOW DO

02:18:59.631 --> 02:19:02.467
WE- WILL. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

02:19:02.534 --> 02:19:04.703
PEOPLE. GETTING INTO ARE BEING

02:19:04.769 --> 02:19:07.739
ADDICTED TO DRUGS. AND THE

02:19:07.806 --> 02:19:09.708
CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IT OUR

02:19:09.774 --> 02:19:11.876
WITH REGARDS TO CREATING. A

02:19:11.943 --> 02:19:13.111
CULTURE AND THIS IS WHY I ASKED

02:19:13.178 --> 02:19:14.713
ABOUT YOU KNOW THE DATA IN

02:19:14.779 --> 02:19:15.547
OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE

02:19:15.613 --> 02:19:16.748
PERCEPTION THE CULTURAL

02:19:16.815 --> 02:19:19.718
ACCEPTANCE OF. OF DRUG USE IS

02:19:19.784 --> 02:19:22.420
IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I THINK-

02:19:22.487 --> 02:19:24.222
IN MY MIND I SEE MANY PEOPLE

02:19:24.289 --> 02:19:26.091
WHO USE DRUGS ENTERING BECAUSE

02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:27.826
OF BEHAVIOR HELP IN TRYING TO

02:19:27.892 --> 02:19:29.027
DEAL WITH HIM BECAUSE THEY

02:19:29.094 --> 02:19:30.695
DON'T HAVE THE COPING SKILLS

02:19:30.762 --> 02:19:31.296
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TAUGHT THE

02:19:31.362 --> 02:19:33.398
COPING SKILLS. TO DEAL WITH

02:19:33.465 --> 02:19:36.901
ISSUES AND SO THAT IS ONE VENUE

02:19:36.968 --> 02:19:39.003
THAT THEY USED TO. MEDICATE

02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:41.172
THEMSELVES ANYWAY- SO YOU SEE

02:19:41.239 --> 02:19:42.640
IT AS THE HEALTH PROBLEMS OF

02:19:42.707 --> 02:19:44.242
THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROBLEM.

02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:46.277
AND FOR SOME IT'S JUST

02:19:46.344 --> 02:19:47.112
SOMETHING THAT THEY DID BECAUSE

02:19:47.178 --> 02:19:49.748
IT WAS- YOU KNOW USE AMONGST

02:19:49.814 --> 02:19:52.450
THEIR THEIR PEERS- FROM THE

02:19:52.517 --> 02:19:53.518
THAT THEY JUST TRIED ONCE AND

02:19:53.585 --> 02:19:55.520
THEN BECAME ADDICTED TO. OUR

02:19:55.587 --> 02:19:56.688
EVENTUALLY SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:19:56.755 --> 02:19:58.456
ISSUES THAT GO INTO THE DRUG

02:19:58.523 --> 02:20:01.493
USE. BUT THE CONCERN THAT I

02:20:01.559 --> 02:20:05.063
HAVE IS ONE. IS IT CREATING

02:20:05.130 --> 02:20:08.133
THESE SITES AND THE ALLOWING

02:20:08.199 --> 02:20:11.770
SOME OF THE POPULATION TO FEEL

02:20:11.836 --> 02:20:14.305
THAT IT IS OKAY IT WILL BE SAFE

02:20:14.372 --> 02:20:15.840
TO DO DRUGS OR TO EXPERIMENT

02:20:15.907 --> 02:20:18.143
BECAUSE THERE'S A SAFETY NET

02:20:18.209 --> 02:20:20.845
BEHIND IT- AND I'M NOT SURE

02:20:20.912 --> 02:20:22.580
WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD AND I

02:20:22.647 --> 02:20:23.648
AND I DON'T KNOW THIS IS WHY I

02:20:23.715 --> 02:20:25.617
ASKED FOR FREE CITIES OR OR

02:20:25.683 --> 02:20:27.552
DATA ON THAT BUT I'M NOT SURE

02:20:27.619 --> 02:20:32.690
THAT. THIS WOULD. CURTAIL

02:20:32.757 --> 02:20:36.961
SOMEONE'S- FEAR OR I'M NOT SURE

02:20:37.028 --> 02:20:39.664
WHAT COULD HELP THEM NOT WANT

02:20:39.731 --> 02:20:41.833
TO PURSUE OR TRY DRUGS- IT'S

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:42.867
NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BE

02:20:42.934 --> 02:20:44.636
COMPELLED TO USE OR OR OR DO

02:20:44.702 --> 02:20:45.970
BUT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

02:20:46.037 --> 02:20:47.272
INDIVIDUALS WITH DIFFERENT

02:20:47.338 --> 02:20:48.940
CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS AND LIFE

02:20:49.007 --> 02:20:52.677
EXPERIENCES THAT MIGHT BE MORE-

02:20:52.744 --> 02:20:57.115
RECEPTIVE TO- OR MORE. AB MUSIC

02:20:57.182 --> 02:21:00.084
RECEPTIVE AT MORE PRONE TO USE

02:21:00.151 --> 02:21:01.319
THEIR DRUGS I'M JUST CAN

02:21:01.386 --> 02:21:03.488
NERVOUS THAT THIS THAT THIS

02:21:03.555 --> 02:21:06.057
BILL IN PLACE WOULD MAKE IT A

02:21:06.124 --> 02:21:09.227
LITTLE EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO AT

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:12.063
LEAST TRY AND NOT KNOWING THEIR

02:21:12.130 --> 02:21:14.365
GENETIC MAKEUP OR PRIEST

02:21:14.432 --> 02:21:16.568
DISPOSITION TO ADDICTION THAT

02:21:16.634 --> 02:21:18.937
THIS WOULD CREATE A CYCLE THAT

02:21:19.003 --> 02:21:21.206
WOULD MAKE- CERTAIN DESERT

02:21:21.272 --> 02:21:23.041
ERROR ISSUES A LITTLE OF THE

02:21:23.107 --> 02:21:26.110
ISSUE WORSE- THIS IS WHY I WAS

02:21:26.177 --> 02:21:27.145
ASKING WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE

02:21:27.212 --> 02:21:29.714
ANY DATA. ON WHETHER OR NOT

02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:31.649
CULTURALLY OR SO IN IN THERE IN

02:21:31.716 --> 02:21:32.550
THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE THIS

02:21:32.617 --> 02:21:34.252
COUNTRY'S THE DRUG USE

02:21:34.319 --> 02:21:37.021
INCREASED OR DECREASED AND THE

02:21:37.088 --> 02:21:39.958
PERCEPTION OF IT IF IT WAS.

02:21:40.024 --> 02:21:40.725
SOMETHING THAT WAS STILL.

02:21:40.792 --> 02:21:43.461
LOOKED UPON NEGATIVELY OR IF IT

02:21:43.528 --> 02:21:45.597
WAS LOOKED UPON AS SOMETHING

02:21:45.663 --> 02:21:55.273
IT'S OKAY. IF YOU'RE GONNA USE

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:55.907
IT BECAUSE THERE'S A SAFETY NET

02:21:55.974 --> 02:21:57.809
THE HIGH DO YOU HAVE ANY. OR

02:21:57.876 --> 02:21:58.576
FOR. YEAH AND TO BE CLEAR WE

02:21:58.643 --> 02:21:59.510
ALL. PEOPLE TO BE HELL AND

02:21:59.577 --> 02:22:00.111
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

02:22:00.178 --> 02:22:01.012
ARE YOU DRUGS OUT WANT TO STOP

02:22:01.079 --> 02:22:02.580
USING. AND THAT WE WANT WE WANT

02:22:02.647 --> 02:22:04.582
TO HELP THEM STOP USING BUT

02:22:04.649 --> 02:22:06.518
ABOVE ALL WE WANT THEM TO BE

02:22:06.584 --> 02:22:08.887
SAFE AND NOT DIE. AND WE HAVE

02:22:08.953 --> 02:22:11.489
TRIED THE APPROACHES OF THIS

02:22:11.556 --> 02:22:13.024
YEAR LECTURING PEOPLE AND

02:22:13.091 --> 02:22:14.926
TELLING THEM TO STOP USING- WE

02:22:14.993 --> 02:22:17.695
TRIED THE STRATEGY OF THROWING

02:22:17.762 --> 02:22:19.430
THEM IN JAIL. AND IT HASN'T

02:22:19.497 --> 02:22:21.532
WORKED YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:22:21.599 --> 02:22:23.635
MORE. DRUG USE AND ADDICTION

02:22:23.701 --> 02:22:26.871
NOW THAN THAN IN THE PAST AND

02:22:26.938 --> 02:22:29.107
SO YOUR THIS IS ON. THE VERGE

02:22:29.173 --> 02:22:32.243
OF THE SITE DON'T. GET PEOPLE

02:22:32.310 --> 02:22:34.212
STARTED ON USING DRUGS THESE

02:22:34.279 --> 02:22:35.513
SITES ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE

02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:37.348
BEEN FRANKLY USING PROBABLY FOR

02:22:37.415 --> 02:22:40.585
A WHILE. OFTEN ON OUR STREETS.

02:22:40.652 --> 02:22:41.920
THESE ARE PROBABLY YOU KNOW FOR

02:22:41.986 --> 02:22:43.788
SOME OF OUR MOST MARGINALIZED

02:22:43.855 --> 02:22:47.859
COMMUNITIES OF DRUG USERS- AND

02:22:47.926 --> 02:22:48.393
THAT WERE OFFERING THEM A

02:22:48.459 --> 02:22:54.499
SERVICE. WHERE THEY CAN USE. IN

02:22:54.565 --> 02:22:55.033
A MUCH SAFER ENVIRONMENT-

02:22:55.099 --> 02:22:56.267
REDUCE THE RISK OF IN FACT. AND

02:22:56.334 --> 02:22:59.837
OVERDOSE DEATHS- AND GET ACCESS

02:22:59.904 --> 02:23:01.005
TO SERVICES AND IN THESE

02:23:01.072 --> 02:23:03.308
PROGRAMS NOT EVERYONE BUT A

02:23:03.374 --> 02:23:05.243
SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE. OF

02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:06.778
PEOPLE ULTIMATELY GO INTO

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:09.747
RECOVERY SO THESE CENTERS.

02:23:09.814 --> 02:23:12.216
THESE SITES HELP PEOPLE AND TO

02:23:12.283 --> 02:23:13.618
RECOVER MAYBE THEY'LL DO IT THE

02:23:13.685 --> 02:23:15.320
FIRST TIME TO GO THERE MAYBE

02:23:15.386 --> 02:23:16.321
IT'LL BE THE FIFTIETH TIME TO

02:23:16.387 --> 02:23:18.656
GO THERE. BUT EVENTUALLY A GOOD

02:23:18.723 --> 02:23:19.724
NUMBER OF THEM WILL GOING TO

02:23:19.791 --> 02:23:21.793
RECOVERY AND THIS WILL HELP

02:23:21.859 --> 02:23:23.161
THEM DO SO AND WILL HELP KEEP

02:23:23.227 --> 02:23:25.830
THEM ALIVE. AS THEY MAKE THAT

02:23:25.897 --> 02:23:28.366
JOURNEY TOWARDS RECOVERY. I

02:23:28.433 --> 02:23:31.536
RESPECT THAT. THE INTENT. I'M

02:23:31.602 --> 02:23:33.805
JUST CONCERNED THAT HAVING

02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:38.676
THESE FACILITIES AND MAKING AB-

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:40.445
OF MAKING THEM READILY

02:23:40.511 --> 02:23:44.449
AVAILABLE OR BEING APPROVED.

02:23:44.515 --> 02:23:46.918
CREATES A SENSE OUR PERCEPTION

02:23:46.985 --> 02:23:50.755
THAT IT'S OKAY TO TRY I'M AND

02:23:50.822 --> 02:23:52.090
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE I AND I

02:23:52.156 --> 02:23:53.925
KNOW THIS IS INTENDED FOR

02:23:53.992 --> 02:23:54.525
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN USING FOR A

02:23:54.592 --> 02:23:56.661
WHILE BUT- EVERYTHING THAT WE

02:23:56.728 --> 02:23:59.130
DO CREATE A CERTAIN. PERCEPTION

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:01.099
OR CULTURAL ACCEPTANCE OF

02:24:01.165 --> 02:24:02.533
ISSUES AND I'M JUST CONCERNED

02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:05.536
THAT THISBILL. WOULD CREATE A

02:24:05.603 --> 02:24:07.672
PERCEPTION THAT IT'S OKAY.

02:24:07.739 --> 02:24:09.374
BECAUSE THERE'S A SAFETY NET-

02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:12.710
SO. I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT

02:24:12.777 --> 02:24:14.512
THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF.

02:24:14.579 --> 02:24:16.047
EATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE

02:24:16.114 --> 02:24:18.816
THINK THAT IT'S OKAY TO TRY

02:24:18.883 --> 02:24:22.487
AND- BY PROVIDING BUT I DO

02:24:22.553 --> 02:24:25.690
RESPECT THE- INTENT OF TRYING

02:24:25.757 --> 02:24:27.525
TO SAVE LIVES BECAUSE I THINK

02:24:27.592 --> 02:24:29.927
THAT'S IMPORTANT- BUT I'M JUST

02:24:29.994 --> 02:24:32.163
I'M A LITTLE HESITANT ABOUT

02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:36.801
THE- FORWARD THINKING AND-

02:24:36.868 --> 02:24:39.771
MORAL ACCEPTANCE OF DRUG USE-

02:24:39.837 --> 02:24:45.910
EVENTUALLY. I RESPECT THAT I

02:24:45.977 --> 02:24:46.844
HAVE A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT

02:24:46.911 --> 02:24:49.847
PERSPECTIVE THANK THANK YOU

02:24:49.914 --> 02:24:52.750
SYNERGEN. THANK YOU MISTER

02:24:52.817 --> 02:24:57.955
CHAIRMAN OF- THANK YOU CENTER

02:24:58.022 --> 02:25:00.691
WIN FOR BRINGING THE BILL THIS

02:25:00.758 --> 02:25:04.729
THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER A

02:25:04.796 --> 02:25:09.167
PROGRAM LIKE THIS IN EFFECT.

02:25:09.233 --> 02:25:12.570
JUSTIFIES WERE- CREATES A

02:25:12.637 --> 02:25:14.472
PERMISSIVE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR

02:25:14.539 --> 02:25:18.109
ORTIZ SAYS TO A USER HEY IT'S

02:25:18.176 --> 02:25:20.411
OKAY TO USE- THESE ARE

02:25:20.478 --> 02:25:22.713
DIFFICULT OUTSIDE AS YOU

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:24.115
QUESTIONS THAT WE ALL GRAPPLE

02:25:24.182 --> 02:25:27.885
WITH BECAUSE IT WILL BE FOR ONE

02:25:27.952 --> 02:25:29.420
WHEN I'VE LOOKED AT RESEARCH.

02:25:29.487 --> 02:25:32.223
THERE ARE VERY VERY FEW ADDICTS

02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:37.128
WHO IN ANY WAY OUR. PROUDER

02:25:37.195 --> 02:25:39.163
PLEASED TO BE AN ADDICT THAT

02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:41.466
MOST ADDICTS REALLY WOULD

02:25:41.532 --> 02:25:45.136
PREFER NOT TO BE NOW. IT THESE

02:25:45.203 --> 02:25:46.737
TYPE OF ADDICTIONS I THINK MOST

02:25:46.804 --> 02:25:48.739
OF US KNOW ARE REALLY HARD TO

02:25:48.806 --> 02:25:51.008
KICK. M. BUT THE THING THAT'S I

02:25:51.075 --> 02:25:53.244
FIND REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT

02:25:53.311 --> 02:25:55.680
THE RESEARCH IS THAT. THE TYPE

02:25:55.746 --> 02:25:57.648
OF INJECTABLE DRUGS THAT WOULD

02:25:57.715 --> 02:26:00.351
BE- SAFE IN THESE TYPE OF

02:26:00.418 --> 02:26:03.621
SETTINGS. THEIR USE HAS

02:26:03.688 --> 02:26:05.790
INCREASED ACROSS EVERY

02:26:05.857 --> 02:26:08.192
DEMOGRAPHIC IN THE U. S. IN THE

02:26:08.259 --> 02:26:08.926
LAST TWENTY YEARS EVERY

02:26:08.993 --> 02:26:12.063
DEMOGRAPHIC. IN INTERESTINGLY

02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:13.364
THE FOLKS THAT WOULD USE THE

02:26:13.431 --> 02:26:16.434
SITES ARE PEOPLE THAT BY AND

02:26:16.501 --> 02:26:18.769
LARGE DON'T HAVE A PLACE WHERE

02:26:18.836 --> 02:26:23.708
THEY CAN. USE IT'S NOT TO SAY

02:26:23.774 --> 02:26:25.409
THAT ANY USER SAY A WEALTHY

02:26:25.476 --> 02:26:28.646
USER IS ANY SAFER THEY CAN DIE

02:26:28.713 --> 02:26:32.650
OF AN OVERDOSE ALSO. BUT THEY

02:26:32.717 --> 02:26:35.786
THEY CAN BE AT HOME OR THEY CAN

02:26:35.853 --> 02:26:38.156
BE AMENDED IN OTHER WORDS THIS

02:26:38.222 --> 02:26:40.791
THESE TYPE OF SITES ARE REALLY

02:26:40.858 --> 02:26:44.962
MUCH MORE USED FOR USERS THAT.

02:26:45.029 --> 02:26:46.497
IN FACT HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO

02:26:46.564 --> 02:26:49.200
AND POSSIBLY ARE USING MORE

02:26:49.267 --> 02:26:51.102
BECAUSE EITHER THEY LIVE ON THE

02:26:51.169 --> 02:26:53.070
STREET OR THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES

02:26:53.137 --> 02:26:55.406
ARE SUCH. AND THAT ITS

02:26:55.473 --> 02:26:57.975
POTENTIAL THAT BY THIS SUCH A

02:26:58.042 --> 02:27:01.679
SITE. THEY MAY USE LESS. THEY

02:27:01.746 --> 02:27:02.980
THEN HAVE ACCESS TO PEOPLE WHO

02:27:03.047 --> 02:27:06.484
COULD. PUT THEM ON A PATH

02:27:06.551 --> 02:27:08.486
TOWARDS TREATMENT THEY ALSO

02:27:08.553 --> 02:27:10.288
HAVE MORE ACCESS I MEAN THE

02:27:10.354 --> 02:27:11.689
OTHER RESEARCH SHOWS THAT FOR

02:27:11.756 --> 02:27:13.457
EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE A VERY LOW

02:27:13.524 --> 02:27:16.494
INCOME USER. IF YOU HAVE EATEN

02:27:16.561 --> 02:27:18.062
IF YOU'VE HAD NEW YOUR

02:27:18.129 --> 02:27:20.131
NUTRITION MET YOU USE LESS.

02:27:20.198 --> 02:27:21.933
THEY'RE ALL THESE FACTORS THAT

02:27:21.999 --> 02:27:25.236
CONTRIBUTE. TO- EITHER A

02:27:25.303 --> 02:27:27.338
PATHWAY TO GET OFF OF THE DRUG

02:27:27.405 --> 02:27:29.840
OR TO USE LESS OF IT. AND SUCH

02:27:29.907 --> 02:27:32.109
A SITE IN THE RESEARCH THAT

02:27:32.176 --> 02:27:34.378
I'VE LOOKED AT WOULD HELP

02:27:34.445 --> 02:27:35.346
FACILITATE THAT DOESN'T

02:27:35.413 --> 02:27:37.081
GUARANTEE IT BUT IT WOULD HELP

02:27:37.148 --> 02:27:39.083
FACILITATE IT. NOW THE OTHER

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:42.620
THING IS THAT UNFORTUNATELY.

02:27:42.687 --> 02:27:45.022
OVERDOSES NOW BECAUSE OF THE

02:27:45.089 --> 02:27:47.425
WAY VERY SEIZE DRUGS ARE BEING

02:27:47.491 --> 02:27:48.960
SPIKED WHETHER WITH FAT NO OR

02:27:49.026 --> 02:27:51.295
OTHER MATERIALS. ARE ON THE

02:27:51.362 --> 02:27:53.698
RISE ALSO VERY SIGNIFICANTLY

02:27:53.764 --> 02:27:56.033
AND AGAIN OKAY OF CROSSED ALL

02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:58.569
DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. BUT THIS

02:27:58.636 --> 02:28:01.639
HAS THE HOPE FOR REDUCING THE

02:28:01.706 --> 02:28:04.942
DEATH BECAUSE- YOU KNOW ONCE A

02:28:05.009 --> 02:28:06.978
PERSON'S TED FROM AN OVERDOSE

02:28:07.044 --> 02:28:08.379
THERE IS NO HOPE OF GETTING

02:28:08.446 --> 02:28:09.880
THEM OVER THEIR ADDICTION

02:28:09.947 --> 02:28:12.283
HOWEVER. THERE IS STILL THE

02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:14.051
POSSIBILITY TO GET PASSED IN

02:28:14.118 --> 02:28:17.221
ADDICTION EVEN IF YOUR USER BUT

02:28:17.288 --> 02:28:20.024
NOT ONE TO VOTE DE AND IN SUCH

02:28:20.091 --> 02:28:22.126
A SITE THERE WOULD BE THE

02:28:22.193 --> 02:28:25.563
IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THE- THE

02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:27.531
DRUGS NOR CAN AND SUCH THAT CAN

02:28:27.598 --> 02:28:31.235
HELP PREVENT OR STOP THE DEATH

02:28:31.302 --> 02:28:33.037
FROM THE OVERDOSE. SO I THINK

02:28:33.104 --> 02:28:36.540
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. PILOT TWO

02:28:36.607 --> 02:28:38.476
AND IT WOULD GIVE US A LOT MORE

02:28:38.542 --> 02:28:39.810
INFORMATION THIS IS NOT

02:28:39.877 --> 02:28:41.112
ALLOWING THIS ACROSS THE WHOLE

02:28:41.178 --> 02:28:43.447
STATE BUT IT WOULD GIVE US MORE

02:28:43.514 --> 02:28:45.950
INFORMATION AS TO WHETHER THE

02:28:46.017 --> 02:28:47.551
FOLKS THAT UTILIZE SUCH A

02:28:47.618 --> 02:28:50.254
PILOT. ACTUALLY THEN TAKE

02:28:50.321 --> 02:28:53.124
ADVANTAGE OF MORE SERVICES TO

02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:55.192
GET OFF OF THEIR ADDICTION. AND

02:28:55.259 --> 02:28:57.194
YOU KNOW IF IT DOES NOT TURN

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:59.864
OUT TO BE SO THAT'S THAT MUCH

02:28:59.930 --> 02:29:02.433
MORE INFORMATION WE HAVE- BUT I

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:03.034
THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE TO

02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:05.936
TRY- I WAS FRUSTRATED WHEN

02:29:06.003 --> 02:29:08.105
GOVERNOR BROWN. VETOED THE LAST

02:29:08.172 --> 02:29:13.244
BILL. AND- ALL OF HIS-

02:29:13.311 --> 02:29:13.778
REASONINGS I MEAN GOVERNOR

02:29:13.844 --> 02:29:15.880
BROWN HAS A- KIND OF DFFERENT

02:29:15.946 --> 02:29:18.482
ATTITUDE ON DRUG USE WHICH

02:29:18.549 --> 02:29:22.053
LOOK- I DON'T FAULT ANYONE FOR.

02:29:22.119 --> 02:29:23.554
I THINK ALL OF US WOULD PREFER

02:29:23.621 --> 02:29:25.656
THAT THERE NOT BE ANY ADDICTS

02:29:25.723 --> 02:29:27.525
OF ANY SORT WHETHER IT'S

02:29:27.591 --> 02:29:29.627
ALCOHOL INJECTABLE DRUGS OR ANY

02:29:29.694 --> 02:29:32.763
OTHER. HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT

02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:33.898
IT'S QUITE RAMPANT AND

02:29:33.964 --> 02:29:35.599
ESPECIALLY AN INJECTABLE DRUGS

02:29:35.666 --> 02:29:37.568
UNFORTUNATELY NOW AND ACROSS

02:29:37.635 --> 02:29:39.637
ALL DEMOGRAPHICS. AND THE

02:29:39.704 --> 02:29:44.308
THREAT OF. FEDERAL FEDS COMING

02:29:44.375 --> 02:29:46.711
DOWN US AT THE TIME WAS REAL IT

02:29:46.777 --> 02:29:48.779
WOULD BE LESS NOW IT'S NOT TO

02:29:48.846 --> 02:29:50.915
SAY THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE

02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:52.983
MINUTES WERE IT'S STILL NOT

02:29:53.050 --> 02:29:55.986
FEDERAL LAW TO ALLOW BUT WE'RE

02:29:56.053 --> 02:29:56.520
THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE A

02:29:56.587 --> 02:29:58.923
DIFFERENT. PERSPECTIVE BUT WE

02:29:58.989 --> 02:30:00.658
WILL SEE BUT I THINK IT'S AN

02:30:00.725 --> 02:30:02.159
IMPORTANT PILOT TO TRY BECAUSE

02:30:02.226 --> 02:30:03.961
IT WOULD GIVE US SOME

02:30:04.028 --> 02:30:04.528
INFORMATION AND WITHOUT ALL

02:30:04.595 --> 02:30:08.332
MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU IN THE

02:30:08.399 --> 02:30:10.334
CAR A SENATOR CALM WATER THANK

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:12.336
YOU MISTER CHAIR I TOO WILL BE

02:30:12.403 --> 02:30:14.071
SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND- I

02:30:14.138 --> 02:30:16.407
THINK I'M A CO AUTHOR I JUST

02:30:16.474 --> 02:30:20.544
WANTED TO ADD IT- IT'S- I THINK

02:30:20.611 --> 02:30:21.946
WE WANT TO BE OPERATIONAL WHEN

02:30:22.012 --> 02:30:23.914
WE TALK ABOUT. DRUG USE AND

02:30:23.981 --> 02:30:26.283
DRUG ADDICTION AND- PEOPLE NOT

02:30:26.350 --> 02:30:27.852
WANTING TO BE ON DRUGS. YOU

02:30:27.918 --> 02:30:29.587
KNOW THE REALITY IS THAT WHILE

02:30:29.653 --> 02:30:30.988
THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO ARE

02:30:31.055 --> 02:30:32.556
TRYING TO GET OFF THEIR ALSO

02:30:32.623 --> 02:30:35.359
FOLKS WHO ARE NOT. YOU KNOW

02:30:35.426 --> 02:30:38.362
WHO- LIKE DRUGS LIKE DOING

02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:39.997
DRUGS LIKE STAYING HIGH FOR

02:30:40.064 --> 02:30:42.099
WHATEVER THE REASON IS AND I

02:30:42.166 --> 02:30:43.501
THINK WHEN WE START HAVING

02:30:43.567 --> 02:30:45.669
THOSE DISCUSSIONS. IT MOVES

02:30:45.736 --> 02:30:47.171
FROM BEING- CONVERSATION AROUND

02:30:47.238 --> 02:30:48.873
POLICY. TO BEING ONE AROUND

02:30:48.939 --> 02:30:50.908
MORALITY. AND THAT ISN'T REALLY

02:30:50.975 --> 02:30:53.077
SOMETHING THAT. WE SHOULD BE IN

02:30:53.144 --> 02:30:54.779
THE BUSINESS OF TRYING TO

02:30:54.845 --> 02:30:57.348
LEGISLATE- THE MORALITY OF HOW

02:30:57.415 --> 02:30:59.583
FOLKS LIVE THEIR LIFE I THINK.

02:30:59.650 --> 02:31:03.421
WHEN WE'RE ASKING WHERE WE'RE

02:31:03.487 --> 02:31:05.689
NOT TALKING ABOUT DRUG USE AND

02:31:05.756 --> 02:31:07.525
ABUSE AND ADDICTION AND

02:31:07.591 --> 02:31:09.827
OVERDOSING. THEN WE'RE

02:31:09.894 --> 02:31:13.631
ESSENTIALLY PUSHING USERS WERE

02:31:13.697 --> 02:31:16.033
KEEPING THEM IN THE SHADOWS-

02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:17.802
AND NOT ALLOWING US TO HAVE

02:31:17.868 --> 02:31:19.804
HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:23.140
PROGRAMMING AROUND SUPPORT

02:31:23.207 --> 02:31:27.011
AROUND HOW TO GET HELP- BECAUSE

02:31:27.077 --> 02:31:29.079
WE'RE NOT BEING HONEST ABOUT

02:31:29.146 --> 02:31:30.114
THE CHALLENGES THAT FOLKS ARE

02:31:30.181 --> 02:31:32.650
FACING AND THE IMPACT THAT DRUG

02:31:32.716 --> 02:31:33.717
USE AND ABUSE HAS ON

02:31:33.784 --> 02:31:35.586
COMMUNITIES I SUPPORT THE FACT

02:31:35.653 --> 02:31:37.087
THAT THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM I

02:31:37.154 --> 02:31:38.889
THINK THERE'S A SUNSET OF IT.

02:31:38.956 --> 02:31:41.492
ON IT FOR TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN

02:31:41.559 --> 02:31:43.227
AND LET'S SEE WHAT WORKS

02:31:43.294 --> 02:31:45.496
BECAUSE WHAT ISN'T WORKING IS

02:31:45.563 --> 02:31:47.031
NOT TALKING ABOUT IT NOT

02:31:47.097 --> 02:31:48.499
FIGURING OUT WAYS TO DEAL WITH

02:31:48.566 --> 02:31:50.067
IT NOT MEETING PEOPLE WHERE

02:31:50.134 --> 02:31:52.102
THEY ARE WITH THEIR ADDICTION.

02:31:52.169 --> 02:31:55.606
AND ALLOWING- UNDERGROUND

02:31:55.673 --> 02:31:58.909
MARKET TO PROLIFERATE WHERE

02:31:58.976 --> 02:32:02.246
FOLKS ARE TAKING LOTS OF DRUGS

02:32:02.313 --> 02:32:03.814
TO THE SKINNER'S POINT AND

02:32:03.881 --> 02:32:06.784
ACTUALLY TAKING MORE BAD DRUGS-

02:32:06.851 --> 02:32:08.752
THAT ARE CUT WITH NASTY

02:32:08.819 --> 02:32:12.590
SUBSTANCES- THAT LEAD TO

02:32:12.656 --> 02:32:13.891
GREATER ADDICTION AND TO DEATH.

02:32:13.958 --> 02:32:15.626
AND BY NOT CREATING THESE KINDS

02:32:15.693 --> 02:32:18.062
OF SITES YOU ACTUALLY STILL

02:32:18.128 --> 02:32:20.631
CONTINUE TO PERMIT. DRUG USED

02:32:20.698 --> 02:32:21.765
TO HAPPEN WHERE YOU REALLY

02:32:21.832 --> 02:32:24.001
DON'T WANT TO SEE IT. IN FRONT

02:32:24.068 --> 02:32:25.769
OF CHILD CARE CENTERS ARE AT

02:32:25.836 --> 02:32:29.940
THE BUS STOP OUT IN THE OPEN-

02:32:30.007 --> 02:32:33.077
SO WHY DON'T WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE

02:32:33.143 --> 02:32:35.079
ADDICTION CRISIS THAT WE HAVE.

02:32:35.145 --> 02:32:37.882
AND TRY SOMETHING TRY AND

02:32:37.948 --> 02:32:40.918
APPROACH. TO FORCE THE ISSUE

02:32:40.985 --> 02:32:43.020
AROUND WHAT RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE

02:32:43.087 --> 02:32:46.223
WHAT ADDICTION LOOKS LIKE- YOU

02:32:46.290 --> 02:32:46.824
KNOW HOW TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE

02:32:46.891 --> 02:32:48.759
THEY ARE. THERE HAVE BEEN

02:32:48.826 --> 02:32:50.060
STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN IN

02:32:50.127 --> 02:32:51.428
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WHEN YOU

02:32:51.495 --> 02:32:53.731
HAVE THESE KINDS OF SITES YOU

02:32:53.797 --> 02:32:55.299
ACTUALLY DO DECREASE. OR MENTAL

02:32:55.366 --> 02:32:57.868
BEHAVIOR AND ACTIVITY- AND

02:32:57.935 --> 02:32:58.736
THERE IS A GREATER

02:32:58.802 --> 02:33:01.005
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ABUSE AND

02:33:01.071 --> 02:33:02.072
THERE'S ACTUALLY GREATER

02:33:02.139 --> 02:33:04.475
INFUSION OF RESOURCES TO HELP

02:33:04.542 --> 02:33:07.344
DEAL WITH- BEHAVIORAL

02:33:07.411 --> 02:33:09.246
CHALLENGES AND ADDICTION. BUT

02:33:09.313 --> 02:33:10.781
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT THE

02:33:10.848 --> 02:33:13.984
KIND OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT- AND

02:33:14.051 --> 02:33:15.719
SAVE SPACE FOR PEOPLE TO TALK

02:33:15.786 --> 02:33:18.489
ABOUT AND TO SHOW- YOU KNOW

02:33:18.556 --> 02:33:22.059
THEY'RE CRISIS- AND WE'VE BEEN.

02:33:22.126 --> 02:33:24.862
IT REMINDS ME ACTUALLY OF THE

02:33:24.929 --> 02:33:25.429
HEARING WE HAD RIGHT BEFORE

02:33:25.496 --> 02:33:28.165
BREAK- WITH FAMILIES TALKING

02:33:28.232 --> 02:33:30.100
ABOUT ADDICTION AND OVERDOSE

02:33:30.167 --> 02:33:32.136
AND MANY OF THOSE WERE STORIES

02:33:32.202 --> 02:33:34.271
OF FOLKS KIND OF IN THE SHADOWS.

02:33:34.338 --> 02:33:36.707
DEALING WITH DRUG USE AND THIS

02:33:36.774 --> 02:33:38.876
IS AN ATTEMPT TO REALLY YOU

02:33:38.943 --> 02:33:40.444
KNOW RECONCILE I THINK HOW WE

02:33:40.511 --> 02:33:43.948
CONTINUE TO CHASTISE FOLKS- FOR

02:33:44.014 --> 02:33:46.183
BAD DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE OR

02:33:46.250 --> 02:33:48.786
FOR FRAILTIES THAT WE ALL- FIVE

02:33:48.852 --> 02:33:51.255
EIGHT. SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

02:33:51.322 --> 02:33:52.423
THE REASONS WHY I'M SUPPORTING

02:33:52.489 --> 02:33:54.191
THIS BILL ON MY JOINED ON AS A

02:33:54.258 --> 02:33:56.427
CO AUTHOR RECOGNIZING IN LOS

02:33:56.493 --> 02:33:58.662
ANGELES IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE

02:33:58.729 --> 02:34:02.132
HUGE HOT SPOTS. OF DRUG USE.

02:34:02.199 --> 02:34:04.602
AND WE HAVE GOT TO GET CONTROL

02:34:04.668 --> 02:34:06.570
OVER THAT IN THE CONTROL ISN'T

02:34:06.637 --> 02:34:07.905
CHARGING FOLKS WITH CRIMES AND

02:34:07.972 --> 02:34:09.707
PUTTING THEM IN JAIL AND PRISON

02:34:09.773 --> 02:34:11.208
WHERE THEY STILL HAVE ACCESS TO

02:34:11.275 --> 02:34:14.178
DRUGS THAT ARE WORSE- AND THE

02:34:14.244 --> 02:34:15.579
ANSWER ISN'T TO TURN A BLIND

02:34:15.646 --> 02:34:17.147
EYE AND SAY OKAY BECAUSE I

02:34:17.214 --> 02:34:18.449
DON'T DO IT. THAT MEANS IT

02:34:18.515 --> 02:34:19.783
ISN'T HAPPENING AND AS LONG AS

02:34:19.850 --> 02:34:21.385
IT'S NOT IN MY FAMILY THEN I

02:34:21.452 --> 02:34:23.787
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT- SO

02:34:23.854 --> 02:34:26.323
I THINK. WHILE I'M CERTAINLY

02:34:26.390 --> 02:34:30.060
YOU KNOW NOT A FAN. OF DRUG

02:34:30.127 --> 02:34:34.264
USE. I RECOGNIZE THAT WE- HAVE

02:34:34.331 --> 02:34:37.234
BEEN DENYING REALITIES OF IT

02:34:37.301 --> 02:34:39.303
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. AND I'M

02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:42.539
INTERESTED IN. TRYING SOMETHING

02:34:42.606 --> 02:34:45.209
ELSE AS A SOLUTION- TO HELP

02:34:45.275 --> 02:34:46.977
CITIES THAT ARE CHALLENGED BY

02:34:47.044 --> 02:34:49.513
THIS- TO FIGURE OUT NEW WAYS OF

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:51.048
DEALING WITH IT SO I AM

02:34:51.115 --> 02:34:53.017
SUPPORTING THE AUTHOR AND JUST

02:34:53.083 --> 02:34:55.386
WANTED TO SHARE BECAUSE I-

02:34:55.452 --> 02:34:56.654
REALLY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:58.322
ABOUT HOW DO WE CREATE A SPACE

02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:59.556
WHERE WE'RE NOT CONDONING DRUG

02:34:59.623 --> 02:35:01.659
USE- AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE

02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:04.028
IS CONDONING IT. BUT I

02:35:04.094 --> 02:35:06.430
CERTAINLY I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

02:35:06.497 --> 02:35:09.099
THAT IT'S A REALITY- AND THEN

02:35:09.166 --> 02:35:10.901
HOW DO I WORK TO TRY TO HELP

02:35:10.968 --> 02:35:12.936
ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. THE

02:35:13.003 --> 02:35:14.371
BYSTANDERS WHO WERE TRYING TO

02:35:14.438 --> 02:35:16.306
GO FROM POINT A TO POINT B. AND

02:35:16.373 --> 02:35:17.841
THE FOLKS WHO WERE USING AND

02:35:17.908 --> 02:35:18.609
ALSO THE FOLKS WHO WERE

02:35:18.676 --> 02:35:20.844
SELLING. AND LIKE THE FACT THAT

02:35:20.911 --> 02:35:22.446
WE DON'T HAVE THESE KINDS OF

02:35:22.513 --> 02:35:25.249
SPACES BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THEM

02:35:25.315 --> 02:35:25.816
TO HAVE A PROLIFERATION OF

02:35:25.883 --> 02:35:27.985
THEIR OWN BUSINESS- AND I THINK

02:35:28.052 --> 02:35:29.553
IN A WAY THIS ALSO ADDRESSES

02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:31.321
THAT TO. WHICH WE HAVE SEEN IN

02:35:31.388 --> 02:35:32.856

03:09:31.059 --> 03:09:32.461
APPROACHES ARE BEING TAKEN. AND

03:09:32.527 --> 03:09:34.262
THEY SERVE AS A SURFACE LEVEL

03:09:34.329 --> 03:09:35.731

FOR MEDICINAL USE AND IT CAN BE

03:19:48.910 --> 03:19:51.879
VERY POWERFUL IN THERE ARE MANY

03:19:51.946 --> 03:19:52.480
STUDIES SHOWING THAT. ON RIGHT

03:19:52.547 --> 03:19:55.616
NOW BECAUSE PSYCHEDELICS- ARE

03:19:55.683 --> 03:19:57.485
WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THOSE

03:19:57.552 --> 03:19:59.987
CHANGES TO BE ILLEGAL. OTHER

03:20:00.054 --> 03:20:01.923
THAN WITH ONE EXCEPTION UNDER

03:20:01.989 --> 03:20:06.094

FEDERAL LAW- AND SO ON WHAT

03:20:23.077 --> 03:20:25.012
WHAT WE ARE DOING IS SIMPLY

03:20:25.079 --> 03:20:26.381
DECRIMINALIZATION IT'S A FIRST

03:20:26.447 --> 03:20:27.949

03:20:41.496 --> 03:20:42.797
BE REALLY YEAR HOW I DON'T KNOW

03:20:42.864 --> 03:20:45.099

EVER I MEAN SOMETIMES AND WE

03:22:06.814 --> 03:22:07.648
HAD A LITTLE DIALOGUE ABOUT

03:22:07.715 --> 03:22:09.150
THIS BEFORE I CONCERNS AS A

03:22:09.217 --> 03:22:11.118
PERSPECTIVE. THAT IF YOU

03:22:11.185 --> 03:22:12.720
DECRIMINALIZE SOMETHING THAT'S

03:22:12.787 --> 03:22:13.921
GOING TO BE AN INVITATION FOR

03:22:13.988 --> 03:22:16.290
PEOPLE TO USE. AND AS CENTER

03:22:16.357 --> 03:22:17.258
COM LONGER THINGS VERY

ELOQUENTLY SAID BEFORE THAT

03:22:18.693 --> 03:22:20.628
IT'S JUST NOT. THE GUYS JUST

03:22:20.695 --> 03:22:24.565
NOT THE CASE- IF BANNING AND

03:22:24.632 --> 03:22:26.167
CRIMINALIZING DRUG POSSESSION.

03:22:26.234 --> 03:22:28.436
WORKED THEN WE WOULD BE AN

03:22:28.503 --> 03:22:30.204
NEVADA THERE'LL BE NO DRUG USE

03:22:30.271 --> 03:22:31.439
AT ALL IN THE UNITED STATES OF

03:22:31.506 --> 03:22:33.007
AMERICA. BECAUSE THE UNITED

03:22:33.074 --> 03:22:35.243
STATES OF AMERICA. ISN'T IT IF

03:22:35.309 --> 03:22:35.810
YOU IF YOU THINK

03:22:35.877 --> 03:22:37.845
CRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS IS

03:22:37.912 --> 03:22:39.981
GOOD OF DRUG USE IS GOOD. THEN

03:22:40.047 --> 03:22:41.249
YOU WOULD YOU WOULD THINK THAT

03:22:41.315 --> 03:22:43.150
WERE THE ABSOLUTE BEST A PLUS

03:22:43.217 --> 03:22:45.586
COLD STARTS TO HIM BECAUSE- THE

03:22:54.228 --> 03:22:54.795
AND PEOPLE ARE STILL USING EVEN

03:22:54.862 --> 03:22:56.163
THAN THEY WERE. BEFORE AND SO

03:22:56.230 --> 03:22:58.132
BY THE CRIMINAL WE'RE NOT A

03:22:58.199 --> 03:22:59.901
INVITING PEOPLE TO USE. WERE

03:22:59.967 --> 03:23:01.502
TAKING INSTEAD OF A CRIMINAL

03:23:01.569 --> 03:23:03.337
APPROACH TO DRUG USE WE'RE

03:23:03.404 --> 03:23:05.239
TAKING A HEALTH APPROACH

03:23:05.306 --> 03:23:06.140
HELPING PEOPLE WHO NEED TO GET

03:23:06.207 --> 03:23:08.042
IN THE RECOVERY. ALLOWING

03:23:08.109 --> 03:23:09.544
PEOPLE TO USE SUBSTANCES ARE

03:23:09.610 --> 03:23:11.679
HELPFUL. TO THEM AND THAT'S

03:23:11.746 --> 03:23:13.614
WHAT WE'RE TRYING. TO DO HERE

03:23:13.681 --> 03:23:15.049
SO IS THIS LIKE THE PERFECT

03:23:15.116 --> 03:23:16.517
GLOBAL SOLUTION TO EVERYTHING

03:23:16.584 --> 03:23:18.286
NOW I WOULD NEVER. STATE THAT

03:23:18.352 --> 03:23:19.887
WE NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:23:19.954 --> 03:23:21.622
TO START TAKING A MORE FORWARD

03:23:21.689 --> 03:23:23.591
LOOKING APPROACH. TO DRUGS IN

03:23:23.658 --> 03:23:25.393
GENERAL IN PARTICULAR AND TO

03:23:25.459 --> 03:23:27.428
PSYCHEDELICS SPECIFICALLY. BUT

03:23:27.495 --> 03:23:28.729
UNTIL THAT HAPPENS WHAT WE CAN

03:23:28.796 --> 03:23:30.998
DO AS CALIFORNIA IS TO STOP

03:23:31.065 --> 03:23:32.767
ARRESTING AND LOCKING PEOPLE UP

03:23:32.833 --> 03:23:35.469
FOR POSSESSING. AND USING THESE

03:23:35.536 --> 03:23:38.439
DRUGS. SO IN ORDER FOR SENATE

03:23:38.506 --> 03:23:40.808
JUST RIGHT SO I CAN UNDERSTAND.

03:23:40.875 --> 03:23:44.512
IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE. ADAM

03:23:44.579 --> 03:23:45.413
IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE

03:23:45.479 --> 03:23:48.049
IMPLEMENTED IN A IN A MEDICAL

03:23:48.115 --> 03:23:49.951
ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE TO

03:23:50.017 --> 03:23:51.786
DECRIMINALIZE IT FIRST ON THE

03:23:51.852 --> 03:23:53.621
FEDERAL LEVEL IS THAT CORRECT

03:23:53.688 --> 03:23:55.957
WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN- IS THEY

03:23:56.023 --> 03:23:57.725
WOULD HAVE TO BE RESCHEDULING.

03:23:57.792 --> 03:23:59.927
OF THE DRUGS AT THE FEDERAL

03:23:59.994 --> 03:24:01.696
LEVEL AND I THINK OF THE DRUGS

03:24:01.762 --> 03:24:03.531
THAT WE INCLUDE YOUR ONLY ONE

03:24:03.598 --> 03:24:05.266
ACADEMY IN- A DOCTOR CAN

03:24:05.333 --> 03:24:06.634
PRESCRIBE ECONOMY BUT THAT'S

03:24:06.701 --> 03:24:08.436
THE ONLY ONE AND SO WE WOULD

03:24:08.502 --> 03:24:10.137
NEED TO HAVE FEDERAL

03:24:10.204 --> 03:24:12.340
RESCHEDULING OF MORE DRUGS INTO

03:24:12.406 --> 03:24:13.808
ONE PROVISION IN THIS BILL. IS

03:24:13.874 --> 03:24:15.242
THAT IF AND WHEN THERE IS

03:24:15.309 --> 03:24:16.544
FEDERAL RESCHEDULING A

03:24:16.611 --> 03:24:17.878
PARTICULAR SUBSTANCES

03:24:17.945 --> 03:24:19.547
CALIFORNIA WILL AUTOMATICALLY

03:24:19.614 --> 03:24:21.616
RESCHEDULE AS WELL AND AT THAT

03:24:21.682 --> 03:24:23.651
POINT- DOCTORS WOULD BE ABLE TO

03:24:23.718 --> 03:24:26.654
BE INVOLVED BUT WE'RE NOT THERE

03:24:26.721 --> 03:24:29.991
YET. OKAY AND THERE WAS A THERE

03:24:30.057 --> 03:24:31.659
WAS A COMMENT SOME. MAYBE WAS

03:24:31.726 --> 03:24:33.661
THE- I'M NOT SURE WHO MENTIONED

03:24:33.728 --> 03:24:35.463
THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE DRUGS

03:24:35.529 --> 03:24:37.365
THAT WERE. INCLUDED IN THIS

03:24:37.431 --> 03:24:41.002

03:24:48.643 --> 03:24:51.012
NOT INCLUDED AS PART OF THOSE-

03:24:51.078 --> 03:24:52.313
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE

03:24:52.380 --> 03:24:53.180
SHOULD BE ADDRESSING ARE

03:24:53.247 --> 03:24:53.748
PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR

03:24:53.814 --> 03:24:55.049
USING PENCIL EITHER THAT'S A

03:24:55.116 --> 03:24:56.851
MAJOR HEALTH ISSUE. AND WE WANT

03:24:56.917 --> 03:24:58.586
TO HELP PEOPLE IT'S A SEPARATE

03:24:58.653 --> 03:24:59.720

LEASING A SENTINEL WHICH WE

03:25:04.959 --> 03:25:06.727
HEARD ABOUT WOULD CENTER

03:25:06.794 --> 03:25:07.962
MELENDEZ IS BILL WITH. OFFICE

03:25:08.029 --> 03:25:10.765
PERCOCET CENTEL'S ETCETERA-

03:25:10.831 --> 03:25:12.767
THAT'S NOT REALLY TO MY

03:25:12.833 --> 03:25:14.335
KNOWLEDGE A REAL ISSUE WITH

03:25:14.402 --> 03:25:16.237
WITH PSYCHEDELIC SO I CAN'T SAY

03:25:16.303 --> 03:25:18.105
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BUT I THINK

YOU'RE NOT IT'S NOT TYPICAL AT

03:25:20.074 --> 03:25:21.776

RENTAL. AND HOW DO YOU RESPOND

03:25:26.313 --> 03:25:31.185
TO THE DRUG THAT- IS. USED

DURING DAY OR DATE. THE THERE

03:25:32.386 --> 03:25:34.021
IS THERE A DRUG THAT WE X. FOR

03:25:34.088 --> 03:25:37.024
NEXT YEAR. WHICH IS LIKE A-

03:25:37.091 --> 03:25:37.625
WHAT WE THINK OF AS THE DATE

03:25:37.692 --> 03:25:40.027
RAPE. ROG I THINK SHE WAS

03:25:40.094 --> 03:25:41.328
REFERRING TO CADMIUM IF I'M

03:25:41.395 --> 03:25:43.964
NOT- MISTAKEN- AND I CAN KIND

03:25:44.031 --> 03:25:46.000
OF MEAN IS ALREADY SCHEDULED SO

03:25:46.067 --> 03:25:48.436
PHYSICIAN. CAN PRESCRIBE AND

03:25:48.502 --> 03:25:51.772
SO- YOU KNOW WE DID KEEP GHB

03:25:51.839 --> 03:25:53.674
OUT OF THE OUT OF THE BILL.

03:25:53.741 --> 03:25:56.277
TIME AND WHEN WE THINK OF. THE

03:25:56.343 --> 03:25:57.478
DATE RAPE DRUG STOCKS LIKE THE-

03:25:57.545 --> 03:25:59.513
BURKE BUT THE CULPRIT IN CHIEF

03:25:59.580 --> 03:26:00.981
SERVICE SPEAKING WE TALK ON BUT

03:26:01.048 --> 03:26:02.950
IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BILL.

03:26:03.017 --> 03:26:04.118
AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION I

03:26:04.185 --> 03:26:06.921
THINK WOULD BE- WITH REGARDS TO

03:26:06.987 --> 03:26:10.658
IN YOUR- IN YOUR MIND HOW DO WE-

03:26:10.725 --> 03:26:12.159
HOW DO WE RECIPROCATE THE EIGHT

03:26:12.226 --> 03:26:14.462
THE NOTION OF IT I KNOW. WE CAN

03:26:14.528 --> 03:26:16.964
TALK ABOUT MEDICAL. CANNABIS OR

03:26:17.031 --> 03:26:19.667
MARIJUANA BUT- THE FACT THAT IF

03:26:19.734 --> 03:26:21.435
YOU DECRIMINALIZE IT HERE WE

03:26:21.502 --> 03:26:22.269
STILL DON'T HAVE IT AT THE

03:26:22.336 --> 03:26:23.771
FEDERAL LEVEL. THAT'S WHERE WE

03:26:23.838 --> 03:26:26.507
ARE TODAY WITH WITH CANNABIS IN

03:26:26.574 --> 03:26:30.644
CALIFORNIA- FOR ALMOST TWENTY

03:26:30.711 --> 03:26:31.245
FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS I THINK

03:26:31.312 --> 03:26:32.213
IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIFTH

03:26:32.279 --> 03:26:34.448
ANNIVERSARY WE HAVE DID YOU

03:26:34.515 --> 03:26:35.983

IT'LL BUT DON'T USE- AND- WE'VE

03:26:39.887 --> 03:26:41.722
AND SO IF A BUNCH OF STATES I

03:26:41.789 --> 03:26:43.624
THINK 40% OF THE US POPULATION

03:26:43.691 --> 03:26:46.193
NOW LIVES IN THE STATE. OF NEW

03:26:46.260 --> 03:26:48.629

03:26:48.696 --> 03:26:50.431
40% OF AMERICANS LIVE IN STATES

03:26:50.498 --> 03:26:52.366
WHERE IT'S LEGAL TO USE

03:26:52.433 --> 03:26:55.669
CANNABIS- AND CONGRESS HASN'T

03:26:55.736 --> 03:26:57.505
CAUGHT UP IN WHAT I DON'T GET

03:26:57.571 --> 03:26:59.140
ME STARTED ON THE LAUNDRY LIST.

03:26:59.206 --> 03:27:01.308
OF ISSUES WERE THE FEDERAL

03:27:01.375 --> 03:27:02.109
GOVERNMENT'S WAY BEHIND THE

03:27:02.176 --> 03:27:05.246
STATE'S- BUT AS US AS JUSTICE

STATES ARE THE LABORATORIES WE

03:27:09.283 --> 03:27:10.518
TRY THINGS OUT AND THEN THE

03:27:10.584 --> 03:27:11.519
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALTERNATELY

03:27:11.585 --> 03:27:13.988
