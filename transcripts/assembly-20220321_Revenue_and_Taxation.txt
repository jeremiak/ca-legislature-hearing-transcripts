ALRIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WE ARE GOING ON TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON THE BILL. AB SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE WILL PROVIDE A 40% TAX CREDIT FOR THE INSTALLATION OF SPECIFIED ELECTRIC VEHICLE SUPPLY EQUIPMENT. AND MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS- BE- MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS BEGINNING JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE AVAILABILITY OF EASY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURES AND OVERALL COMPONENT IN THE SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION ESTIMATES THAT THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SORRY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND EVEY CHARTERS. WILL BE NEEDED A MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS FOR CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY THIRTY D. AS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. HOWEVER THE LACK OF ACCESS TO HOME CHARGING STATIONS REMAINS A MAJOR BARRIER TO EVEY ADOPTIONS FOR THOSE LIVING IN MULTI FAMILY UNITS. THE ENERGY COMMISSION FOUND THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES HAVE FEWER EASY CHARGING STATIONS FOR CAPITAL. CAPITA THE MIDDLE INCOME COMMUNITIES RELIABLE ACCESS TO EASY STATIONS IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR RENTERS AND THOSE LIVING IN MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AS MUCH AS 85% OF CHARGING A FOR PERSONAL AFTER VEHICLES OCCURS AT HOME BUT MOST PEOPLE LIVING IN APARTMENTS AND CONDOMINIUMS ALSO KNOWN AS MULTI FAMILY. BUILDINGS ARE MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THESE CHARGING STATION. INSTALLING A RECHARGING STATION SPECIALLY IN OLDER MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS THEY DO NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES AN INVESTMENT BY THE DEVELOPER OR THE BILL BILLING OWNER. AND THIS CURRENTLY NO INCENTIVE. TO REALLY DO THIS AND ACTUALLY TO RETROFIT OLDER- MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS. EIGHTY SEVEN- EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE WOULD HELP OWNERS OR DEVELOPERS WITH THE COSTS WERE INCURRED OF. COSTS PAID OR INCURRED FOR THE INSTALLATION OF EVEY CHARGING EQUIPMENT AND NEW CONSTRUCTION ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS TO EXISTING BUILDINGS. INCREASING ACCESS. TO EVEY CHARGING STATIONS A MULTI FAMILY BUILDING CAN ADDRESS THE BARRIERS THAT WE'VE TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN THE STATE OF. CALIFORNIA TO EVEY ADOPTION BY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND ENSURING THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND IN CALIFORNIA'S TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT INCENTIVE TO EXPAND ACCESS TV CHARGERS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS CERTAINLY AND YOU'LL HAVE- I TAKE IT NO. NO WITNESSES NO WAY ROOSEVELT MYSELF SO I'M ALSO HAPPY TO HEAR YOUR FEEDBACK AND THOUGHTS ALL RIGHT- ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES- THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IN THE ROOM. THE AND CAN THE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINE THE MAIN TELEPHONE LINE FOR SUPPORTING WITNESSES. YES IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK ON AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. WE DO HAVE ONE THAT IS PARTY CURED UP WE'LL GO TO LINE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THAT'S ONE THREE THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS JULIE MELANAU SKI BALL AND BE HAPPENING CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION COALITION.

UP FOR WHEN THE INCENTIVES ARE GOING TO GO AWAY- CHARGING INSTALLATION. SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THEMSELVES THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT MODEL THAT WAS THE ONLY. THAT WAS THE ONLY A WITNESS ON THE LINE RIGHT. WE DO HAVE TO ADDITIONAL AND WE'LL GO TO LINE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THAT'S ONE TWO FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BRADY GARRISON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE THANK YOU.

AND MANAGER WITH THAT WE HAVE EXHAUSTED ACU ALL RIGHT IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. KICKING THE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR ANY OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. pAB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. FROM. I'M SURE THERE IS NO ONE SHOWING UP IN OPPOSITION OF THE SUN ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER CLARK ARM SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE FREE RIDER PROBLEM. SO I LIVE IN A MULTI FAMILY BUILDING WHICH IS- GETTING PEOPLE IN NOW WHO CAN DO- WHO HAVE ELECTRIC VEHICLES- THE- MANAGERS OF THE BUILDING OR PUTTING THEM. P FOR ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS. ARM AND BUT THEY'RE DOING IT ANYWAY AND THIS IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE FREE RIDER PROBLEM. TYPICALLY IN UPPER INCOME RANCHING AND THERE'S A LOT OF IT MATTER FACT ALMOST ALL NEW. MARKET ALMOST ALL NEW APARTMENT YOUR MARKET. RENDON AND- WHEN YOU'RE AT THAT MARKET YOU'RE REALLY ON THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS YOU JUST DON'T CARE TO OWN A HOME. I WOULD PREFER A PROGRAM THAT HAD GRANTS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS RATHER THAN TAKING EVERYONE IN. BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BRING A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO. AGAIN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ANYWAY BECAUSE THESE ARE OPERATE CALM THEY'RE COMPETING. FOR CUSTOMERS- SO I THINK THE POTENTIAL IS JUST A LOT OF MONEY HERE. IT WOULD GO OUT THAT WOULD REALLY WOULDN'T HELP WHEREAS IF YOU HAD IT FOR STRICTLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. ARE EITHER IS A TAX BREAK OR AS A GRANT I THINK IT WOULD WORK BETTER THANK YOU. MAY I ASK ARE YOU- IF THE CHAIR FOR ME- ARE YOU ASKING FOR LIKE DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE HOW DO YOU WANT TO. THE FOR ALL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU BUT THE MAIN THING IS. GIVEN THE HELP MORE TO THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED IT AS OPPOSED TO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD. MODERN MARKET RATE HOUSING.AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY FAIR POINT BECAUSE OUR GOAL IS TO GIVE IT TO. THE RIGHT CALIFORNIANS THAT IS THE GOAL WE'VE SEEN IN STUDY AFTER STUDY YOU SEE THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE UPTAKE IN EVEY CHARGERS AND- AS SOMEBODY WHO IS A RENTER MYSELF. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT YOU KNOW I HAPPEN TO HAVE A GARAGE IF I DIDN'T HAVE A GARAGE IF I HAD JUST A CARPORT SPACE AND THAT APARTMENT COMPLEX. I WOULD NOT HAVE AN EASY RIGHT NOW YEAH SO WE ARE TRYING TO GET AT THAT PROBLEM AND SO- WE CAN LOOK AT. ADDING SOME GUARDRAILS AROUND HERE IT ALSO HOPE YOU APPROPRIATIONS WHO WOULD BRING DOWN THE COST IT'S- PROBABLY BY FACTOR FIVE OR SIX SO. JUST SAM YOUR ROCKET SCIENTISTS ALL TRUST YOUR MOUTH MORE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. WHEN I THINK AS WE ARE LOOKING TO IT AS THE CHAIR SAID IN A PRIORITIZE THE AT INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAKE IN TAX TAX EXPENDITURES THE THING I WOULD LOVE TO UNDERSTAND IS HOW WITH THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL HANGS TOGETHER WITH THE IT WAS LIKE THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE ARE INVESTED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET IN BUILDING OUT- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE I KNOW IN IN- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND IN MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE DEBATING NOW I'M WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDING AN ADDITIONAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- SO I THINK ONE THING THAT WOULD HELP ME IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS HANGS TOGETHER. WITH THOSE OTHER PROPOSALS YOU KNOW DO WE NEED ANOTHER LINE ITEM OR IS IT REALLY ABOUT ENSURING THAT IS WE'RE INVESTING ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN BUILDING OUT CALIFORNIA'S SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE THAT THIS IS PART OF THAT PROPOSAL I THINK THEY WORK IN TANDEM MY UNDERSTANDING OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS AN EASY AND YOU KNOW I CAN'T GET FROM AND SENATORS TO CARLSBAD AND BACK HOME ONE CHARGE I'M NINE SIX CARBONS AND SINISTER CORONADO AND BACK ON ONE CHARGE. RIGHT LIKE I CAN'T DO THAT ON MY AV SO WHEN WE'RE BUILDING OUT INFRASTRUCTURE YOU'RE BUILDING OUT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEHAVIOR BUT A MULTI FAMILY HOUSING WE'RE NOT SEEING THE MARKET BUILD AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY'RE NOT RETROFITTING WHEN THEY DO SUBSTANTIAL INNOVATIONS THAT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING AND MOST PEOPLE ARE AT HOME WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TIME IT TAKES TO CHARGE I MEAN THERE'S ONE THING FOR FAST CHARGERS THAT SOLVES RANGE ANXIETY AND THEN ANOTHER THING OF IF I'M GONNA GO AND I'M GONNA BE USING MY EASY AS A COMMUTER VEHICLE. HOW AM I GETTING THAT FIRST CHARGE SO I'M NOT STARTING MY DAY GOING YOU KNOW SPENDING AN HOUR CHARGING IT SOMEWHERE AND. SO I THINK THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER BUT I DON'T THINK WE SOLVED EQUITY PER OF- EEVEE CHARGER IF WE DON'T HAVE A DEDICATED LINE I TO MULTI FAMILY LAW INCOME COMMUNITIES AGE NOT IN OFFICE THE UPTICK. AND I WILL I WANT TO DO IT EITHER FIVE THERE IT AND I TOLD AGREE WITH THAT I'M SORRY IF WE ALREADY TO HAVE A LOT THAT WAS MY QUESTION IS THAT WE DO WE- HAVE A LINE ITEM I. IS OKAY THAT'S INTERESTED INCENTIVIZE. THE REST OF EXISTING MULTI FOR. OR WHEN YOU HAVE THE OUT OF AFFORDABLE UNITS. THE YOU KNOW I HAVE A DIFFERENT BILL THAT DEAL WITH THE WHAT DO YOU DO THE PLUMBING THE FULL TO. THAT THE DIFFERENT CON. DOWN AND THE KIND OF WORK TOGETHER AND THAT WAY IS HOW DO WE ACTUALLY GET. THE CHARGERS IN EIGHT WHERE WHERE PEOPLE NEED THEM. PEOPLE NEED THEM ALONG THE WAY BUT PEOPLE NEED THEM IN THEIR HOMES. WELL I CERTAINLY I'M CERTAINLY AGREE AND APPRECIATE. YOUR GOAL TO BUILD OUT INFRASTRUCTURE THE INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE- I THINK WE CAN ALL RECOGNIZE WE'RE NEVER GOING TO. MEET OUR CLIMATE OBJECTIVES ARE ZERO MISSION OBJECTIVES. WITHOUT THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. I JUST. HAD DID ANYBODY. THE JUST KIND OF A LONG LINES THE NEW HOMES- NEW MULTI HOME ARE READY. US IN FIRST. TO FOR EVEY SO WHAT IT WOULDN'T A MORE IF TO JUST DIRECT TO- RETROFITS OF BUILDINGS IN THE LAW MY UNDERSTANDING OF CURRENT LAWS THE ONLY REQUIRE THE PLUMBING. FOR NEW EVEY IS NOT THE ACTUAL CHARGES THAT'S LIKE SAYING GIVE A PLUMBING FOR A TOILET IN THE HOUSE BUT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY PUT IN THE TOILET. THAT'S WHAT OUR CURRENT LAW DOES AND I HAVE A DIFFERENT BILL THAT ADDRESSES THAT. AND SO HOW DO YOU INCENTIVIZE THEM PUTTING IN BOTH THE PLUMBING AND THE TOILET SO ARE NOT ONLY DOING THE CAPACITY FOR THE CHARGER WHICH IS CURRENT LAW AND NEW A NEW UNITS BUT ACTUALLY THE CHARGES THEMSELVES OF THEM THEY'RE USEFUL. BECAUSE ALL AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS AS A OUR COLLEAGUE SAID YOU'RE SEEING THEM IN AND HIGHER AND HOMES OF THEY KNOW PEOPLE HAVE EV'S THAT'S A VALUE ADDED. ON IT TO THE PROJECT YOU'RE NOT SAYING IT AND LOWER INCOME AND ONE THING WE COULD CONSIDER IS JUST DOING RETROFITTING- MY CONCERN WOULD STILL BE WHAT GETS US FROM JUST THE PLUMBING FOR EV'S TO THE FULL EVEN CHARGING AND WHAT WHAT'S THAT DELTA THERE BUT I'M HAPPY TO WORK. WITH YOU OR ANYBODY STAFF ON ON THAT QUESTION THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS AND AGAIN MY FIRST DAY HERE. OF WOULD. IT BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND TARGETED TO DO A GREAT PROGRAM. WE COULD CONSIDER THE GRANT PROGRAM I MEAN I UP WITH THAT CREDITS THAT'S WHAT I BUT THEY MIGHT BE OTHER WAYS TO DO IT IN A HAPPY TO EXPLOIT PEN WAS SIDE A- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- SUCH AS- ALSO. WELL THANK YOU VERY FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THIS IMPORTANT PROPOSAL FOR CALIFORNIA THAT BEATS MEETS BOTH OUR CLEAN VEHICLE GOALS AND IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER THOUGHTS PLEASE FEEL REPAIRS THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND THAT EITHER HAS ANY THOUGHTS. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO MY OFFICE WERE OPEN FOR SUGGESTIONS THE BEST WAY TO HELP SOLVE THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU TO. HAVE A QUARTERBACK AT THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR GENDERS FOR ITEMS. AB NINE A LOT BY SOME MEMBER. GAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR NICE TO SEE YOU HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M PLEASED TODAY 2% A. B. NINETEEN ELEVEN WHICH WOULD CREATE A TAX CREDIT TO SUPPORT THE PRESERVATION OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AT RISK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN THIS BILL IS AIMED SQUARELY AT OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS WHICH- ALL OF US ARE VERY MUCH AWARE OF. AND IT'S AIMED AT ADDRESSING A VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE PROJECTIONS THAT OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS WE MAY LOSE BETWEEN THIRTY AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS OF DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE URGENCY TO BUILD A NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO MEET OUR HOUSING CRISIS BUT THE IDEA THAT WE MIGHT LOSE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS OR SOMETHING. OF TREMENDOUS CONCERN TO ME AND SO WITH THIS PROGRAM WOULD DO IS TO CREATE A TAX CREDIT MARKET INCENTIVES THAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE THE OWNERS OF THOSE BUILDINGS WERE DEED RESTRICTION OR SUBSIDY IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE. TO SELL ABOUT BUILDING TO A MISSION DRIVEN NONPROFIT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE THAT AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THIS WOULD HAVE I THINK A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT BENEFITS FIRST OF ALL IT WOULD STABILIZE OUR SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN BUILD ON THAT AND NOT GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION IT WOULD PROTECT THOSE TENANTS WHO ARE AT RISK OF DISPLACEMENT. AND I ALSO THINK THAT IF WE WERE TO LOSE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THINK ABOUT THAT IF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND FAMILIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WOKE UP ONE MORNING AND FOUND THAT THE RENTS WERE GOING TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE OVERNIGHT I THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAVE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES FAR STATES HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND SO THIS IS A PROPOSAL OR WE CAN RESERVE UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT YOU THINK ABOUT THE PRICES TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SOME OF OUR URBAN AREAS YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN- AUDITS FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHERE THEY CAN COST SIX SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED K. A DOOR. RATHER THAN DOING THAT WE CAN PRESERVE UNITS FOR ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SO THIS WOULD CREATE A PROGRAM. WHERE WE WOULD- WE WOULD INVEST. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WOULD HELP US PRESERVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I'M REALLY PROUD THAT THIS IS AN APPROACH THAT HAS. GARNERED BROAD SUPPORT FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY ALIGNED SO YOU HAVE- TENDED IN EQUITY GROUPS ON THE SAME SIDE AS LANDLORDS YOU HAVE BUILDERS. AND LABOR THAT OF ALL COME TOGETHER BEHIND. A PROPOSAL. LIKE THIS AND- ALSO BROAD SOME. FROM IT'S A WHERE YOU A- JAMES. AN ALEX THAT ARE BOTH CO AUTHOR WHICH IS A COM THAT YOU DON'T SEE VERY. AROUND SO WE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THIS. WE THINK- IT COULD BE A REALLY BIG DEAL. LEVER THE POWER OF THE MARK LEVERAGE. POWER OF TAX CREDITS- TO HOW PRESERVE. AFFORDABLE HOW APART. SOME OF THEM OF ALL. RIGHT AND AFFORDABLE FOR. IN THIS OF CALIFORNIA SO. LOOKING FOR THE TO THE- WOULD RISK. ASK FOR YOUR- AND AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND HAVE TO WITNESSES HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME TO IT TODAY- IN PERSON IS MARK STIVERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP- AND THEN ON THE PHONE WE HAVE VERONICA BT. FROM THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR ROLE HOUSING. CYBERSTATES YOU YES MARK DIVERS OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY CREATED THE PARTNERSHIP MANY YEARS AGO TO ADVISE AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON HOW TO PRESERVE THE AFFORDABILITY OF THESE AT RISK. DEVELOPMENTS AND THIS BILL IS CRITICAL OUR EFFORTS BECAUSE IT GIVES OWNERS AN INCENTIVE. TO SELL ENTITIES WILL MAINTAIN AFFORDABLE FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS IN THESE OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AFFORDABLE BUT AT RISK OF CONVERTING THE MARKET RATE WHEN THE- AT. WHEN THE RESTRICTIONS EXPIRE BUT THERE'S A WHOLE NOTHER UNIVERSE THAT THIS BILL ALSO ADDRESSES. WITH WHAT WE CALL NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HE ARE CURRENTLY MARKET RATE OF. THAT AREN'T AND THAT ARE. FOR TO THERE UNDER. PRESSURE FOR IT TO- OWNERS TO MAXIMIZE THE RENTS. AN INCREASE RENTALS HOMEOWNERS. ON THOSE RENTERS MAKING. IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO STAY. AND THIS IS CHRISTIAN OPPORTUNITY FOR TO BRING THOSE INTO THE AFFORD HOUSING. WHERE WE KEEP THEM AFFORDABLE FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS- IT BASICALLY ALLOWS NONPROFIT UPTICK. MARKET PLACE RIGHT NOW THE- THEY'RE THEY'RE COMPETING AGAINST. IN A YEAR INVEST. AND REAL IN. TRUST WE CAN CLOSE VERY QUICKLY. AND THIS IS A TOOL THAT BYE BYE. ALLOWING THE OWNERS TO RESULT TAKE SOME EQUITY OUT OF THE PROPERTY AND BE THEN NOT BE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL GAINS ON THAT. IT'S A TOOL THAT NO OTHER BUYER CAN OFFER TO THE SELLER. AND THEN PUTS US AT THE TOP OF THE HEAP IN TERMS OF WHO THE SELLER MIGHT WANT TO WORK WITH AND- BRING THEM INTO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING REAL SO WE VERY MUCH THANK YOU. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND WE LOOK FOR THE PERFECT TIME FOR THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT THANK YOU. RIGHT AND YOU'RE A SECOND WITNESS ON THE LINE AS OF FOR ANNIKA BEAUTY IS THAT CORRECT ALL RIGHT.

FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBERS DR BURKE- SO ARE YOU FIRST OF ALL YOU SORT OF HAVE TWO PARTS TO THE BALLOT I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY COMPATIBLE. BUT LET'S FIRST TALK ABOUT THE DEED RESTRICTED PROPERTIES. ARM AGAIN HAVING SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KEEP THESE DEED RESTRICTED PROPERTIES. ARE GOING BUT NOT ALL OF THEM ARE CREATED EQUAL SOME OF THEM HAVE DONE REASONABLE MAINTENANCE OVER THE YEARS THERE WERE- SOMEONE TAKING OVER. OTHERS YOU'RE MORE QUESTIONABLE AND I'VE SEEN NON PROFITS GET INTO PROBLEMS WHEN THEY'VE PURCHASED THE BUILDING AND THEN FIND OUT HALFWAY THROUGH THAT. THEY REALLY CAN'T MAKE IT WORK- I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANY SOLUTION TO THAT BUT IT'S SOMETHING. BASICALLY NOT ALL PROPERTIES CREATED EQUAL SOMETHING YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT. SECOND PART AGAIN THIS IS SO DIFFERENT IN AND PARTICULAR MOBILE HOME PARK SO HAYWARD HAS. NINE MOBILE HOME PARKS WHICH REPRESENT- ARE REALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING OTHER AREAS- MOBILE HOME RENT CONTROL- PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED TO KEEP UP THE PARKS TO A CERTAIN LEVEL. THEY'RE ALSO WE'VE ZONED IT SO THE ONLY THING THAT YOU COULD PUT IN THIS AREA IS A MOBILE HOME PARK. FURTHER IF A NONPROFIT WERE TO BUY THE MOBILE HOME PARK AND WANTED TO PUT IN. IN OUR APARTMENT BUILDING. MOST OF THESE FOLKS ARE RETIRED- FIXED INCOME. IT WOULD BE A MAJOR DISRUPTION TO THEIR LIVES SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS TO THINK ABOUT AS TIME GOES ON I DON'T EXPECT YOU WOULD HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE ANSWER RIGHT THIS MINUTE. I JUST AS YOU THINK AND IF YOU HAVE AN ANSWER THAT'S CERTAINLY WORTH THINKING ABOUT BUT THOSE OF US. YOU KNOW TWO DIFFERENT CONCERNS THAT I HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU DR CORK AND ALL- OF- TRY TO ADDRESS YOUR THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS QUICKLY THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MR STIVERS WHO HAS THE REAL EXPERTISE HERE- BUT JUST ON THE SECOND POINT. SO THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT CONVERSION SO WHEN P. THAT SOMEBODY WOULD BUY A MOBILE HOME PARK AND THEN BUILD AN APARTMENT BUILDING THE IDEA HERE IS ABOUT PRESERVATION. OF EXISTING UNITS THE IDEA HERE IS ABOUT STABILIZING FAMILIES THAT LIVE IN THOSE CURRENT UNITS RIGHT TO ME THE EXAMPLE THAT I THINK OF FOR THIS BILL. IS THERE'S A BIG YOU KNOW APARTMENT BUILDING SOMEWHERE THAT'S DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S AT THE END OF THOSE FIFTY FIVE YEARS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND IT'S ABOUT TO BECOME MARKET RATE AND SO. THOSE TENANTS ARE RESCUED D. HERE IS TO CONVINCE THE OWNER OF THAT BUILDING RATHER THAN RAISING EVERYBODY'S RENTS TO MARKET RATES OR SELLING THAT BUILDING TO SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO OPERATE IT OR TEAR DOWN AS MARKET RATED. TO TRANSFER IT TO A YOU KNOW AT THAT MISSION DRIVEN NONPROFIT IN HAYWARD THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THOSE FOLKS WOULD BE STABLE I SO I. ALL OF THE LAST MISTER SHRIVER'S COMMA BUT I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO WORRY AS MUCH ABOUT THE SECOND CONCERN- AND THEN ON THE FIRST OKAY NO I AGREE. IF YOU'RE IF IT HAS TO BE MAINTAINED HIS MOBILE HOME PARK THERE WAS JUST A QUESTION OF THE QUALITY OF THE DEVELOPMENT. AND SHOULD BE GIVING THE TAX BREAK ON IN ALL CASES IN I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY THERE IS THAT- YOU KNOW THAT'S- BECAUSE THIS IS VOLUNTARY IT'S GOING TO BE A MARKET MECHANISM THAT'S GOING TO DRIVE IT. FIRST OF ALL YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE A NONPROFIT. THAT WOULD ONE ACQUIRED. PROPERTY THEY WOULD BE DOING A LOT OF. DEAL BUT ALSO THIS. THING IS TRUE. OF A BUYER THAT WOULD BE LOOKING TO OPERATE IT NOT. AS A AND NOT AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS MARKET RATE HOUSING NORMALLY THEY WOULD COME IN. THE UNWILLING TO BID ON THE BUILDING BECAUSE IT WAS MAINTAINED PROPERLY OR THERE WASN'T. APPROPRIATE UPKEEP SO I DON'T KNOW IF MR CYBER AS ANYTHING. BUT I THINK TO ME THAT THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC THE FUND HAS TO BE A BUYER THAT WANTS TO COME IN EITHER MARKET RATE FOR. OR IN THIS CASE TO GET THE TAX CREDIT- QUALIFIED NONPROFIT DEVELOPER- THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WANT TO BID ON A PROPERTY THAT SUB STANDARD. I'VE JUST SEEN IT HAPPEN SO. BUT MAYBE THAT'S RARE IT MAY BE SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T BE WORRIED ABOUT THANKS FOR GOING I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS THAT THEY THAT THE NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS HAVE. CHEN WE HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES INTO MARKET TELEVISION NOT TO DO A REHABILITATION LIKE SOME TYPE OF SUBSIDY FROM THE CITY OR THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING SO. SOMETIMES THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THAT WORK OR THE MARKET SIDE. CAN'T REALLY MAKE THAT WORK. THANK YOU. THIS PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT MEASURE FOR IT IS I THINK I'VE TOLD YOU I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA I JUST I'M WONDER IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THE POINT THAT WAS RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AROUND- THE FACT THAT KIND OF AS THIS IS STRUCTURED IT WOULD POTENTIALLY BE SUBSIDIZING MARKET RATE UNITS AND IS THERE ANY NOTHING THAT WE CAN DO OUR WORK AROUND. THAT WE COULD INCLUDE TO MITIGATE THAT YEAH IT'S A VERY FAIR POINT- AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND I'LL ANSWER THEM ALLOW MR STIVERS TO CHIME IN HERE I FIRST WHAT MIGHT MY CONDITION AS I ASSUME THAT THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE MY GUESS IS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN CASES WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S WHO'S LIVING IN ONE OF THOSE UNITS AND AGAIN EVENTUALLY OVER TIME YOU'RE GOING TO CAPTURE A 100% OF THE UNITS- AND I GUESS THE OTHER THING I GOT IS. YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING TO DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN HER SO I WOULD RATHER TAKE A BUILDING HAVE NINETY OR 95% OR 89% OF THOSE UNITS PRESERVED AND MAY BE SUBSIDIZED ONE PERSON WHO WHO IS IN A LOW INCOME TENANT TO LIVE IN IT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THEN LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANY OF THOSE UNITS AND SO I THINK THAT'S JUST PART OF WHITE- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK YOUR **** MY HOPE AND EXPECTATION IS IT'S GOING TO BE RELATIVELY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN WHERE YOU HAVE THAT TYPE OF SITUATION ARISE I DON'T KNOW. MARK IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YEAH JUST AT THE MARKET RATE UNITS WOULD STILL RENT IT IF THE PEOPLE ARE OVER INCOME THERE THEY WERE THEY WERE ABOVE THE LAW THE LOW INCOME RESTRICTION IN THE BILL THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO PAY MARKET RENT SO THEY WOULD TURN OVER THE NORMAL WAY AND MOST MARKET RATE UNITS TURNED OVER ABOUT 42% PER YEAR SO IN THREE YEARS YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA GET TO A 100% AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT AND YOU HAVE FIFTY TWO MORE YEARS UNDER THE RESTRICTION WHICH IT'S AFFORDABLE. THE OTHER CONSIDERATION THERE IS THE ALTERNATIVE TO THE WAY THE BILL PROPOSES THAT IS IF THEY HAD TO ALL BE AFFORDABLE ON DAY ONE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING TOO MUCH MONEY WOULD HAVE TO BE EVICTED AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO PREVENT EVICTIONS HERE AND LET THE MARKET CURRENT TAKE ITS COURSE TURN THESE OVER OVER TIME BUT THAT SUCH A LONG DEED RESTRICTION THAT WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC BENEFIT FOR A VERY SHORT TIME I'M WHERE FEW UNITS. WILL BE- MARKET RATE. THANKS FOR. THAT THAT CLARIFICATION I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. NUMBER LIVING YEAH I THINK YOU SAW THAT ONE OF THE POINTS THAT YOU MADE IN THE PRESENTATION WAS THE- IT SHOULD DEED RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE ARE PRESENT IN THE CURRENT- HOUSING. ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY BY PUBLIC AGENCY MARIN COUNTY IN PARTICULAR IS TO BUY EXISTING HOUSING STOCK THAT COULD BE LOST I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OF THAT. WHAT IS DEED RESTRICTED BUT IT WAS IF THEY DIDN'T PURCHASE IT TO PRESERVE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST IT TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE- SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE DEED RESTRICTION REQUIREMENT. IN IN YOUR BILL THAT HAS TO BE PRE EXISTING FOR PEOPLE QUALIFY FOR THAT. SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT IT'S BOTH A DEED RESTRICTED SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING ANY I GUESS WHAT WE REFER TO AS NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO SORT OF WHAT YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE MENTIONING- AND- WERE THE ESTIMATES THAT THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP PUT OUT AGAIN MR STIVERS MENTIONED THIS IS THE ENTITY THAT WE AS THE LEGISLATURE CREATED. AND SAID GIVE US ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO DO AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHILE AND SO THEY'VE COME BACK AFTER TALKING TO MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND SAYING WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT IDEA. BUT IT'S LOOKING AT EXACTLY THAT AS WELL- SO I HAVE A- BUT- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS KIND OF- FOLLOWING ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK I GUESS FROM MY- LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE. A LOT OF THE MOBILE HOME PARKS OBVIOUSLY THEY DO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND- MUCH OF IT IS A- NATURALLY OCCURRING BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS IS HE'S- OF MOBILE HOME PARKS FALLING INTO DISARRAY WHEN THEY'RE IN. PRIVATE HANDS. HOW WOULD YOU GUARANTEE. THAT THESE THESE PARKS ARE MAINTAINED OVER THE YEARS. WANT TO TAKE THAT MARK. I'M THE FIRST FOR THE NONPROFITS ARE MISSION ORIENTED IN THE GINNELLY WILL ONLY GET INVOLVED IN THESE IF THEY CAN. DO A GOOD JOB OF MAINTAINING GOOD SOLID STABLE HOUSING FOR THE RESIDENTS BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE AS I MENTIONED THAT THE NONPROFITS HAVE- ABILITY ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT THE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS DO NOT SO- VERONICA BRADY WAS MENTIONING AT THE CITY WE HAVE THE MOBILE HOME PARK PURCHASE AND REHABILITATION PROGRAM. NONPROFIT TAX HAVE ACCESS TO STATE FUNDS TO DO REHABILITATION OF THOSE DEVELOPMENTS IF THEY ARE OCCUPIED BY LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS AND SO- THAT PLUS THE FACT THAT THE NONPROFITS AREN'T SORT OF TRYING TO MAXIMIZE PROFIT THEY'RE TRYING TO. YOU KNOW BE IN FOR THE LONG TERM AND PROVIDE STABLE HOUSING THIS IS FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE BUT NOT GENERATING A TON OF PROFIT. UNDER THOSE WE THINK THAT THAT THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A LOT THESE PROPERTIES OVER TIME WHEN THERE'S ACTUALLY A COMMITMENT TO DO THAT IS THERE ANY WAY TO GUARANTEE THAT THE NONPROFIT DOES THAT WELL. I MEAN H. ET WILL BE MONITORING WELL THE TICKET I'M SORRY T. CAT COULD'VE MISTER THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE MONITORING THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND I USED TO RUN THAT ORGANIZATION AND EVERY THREE YEARS WE WENT OUT TO EVERY SITE IN THE STATE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY WE DID A PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT. THAT WERE NOT OCCURRING- YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE CONSEQUENCES. TO THE OWNER AND- IN ADDITION- IN THE MOBILE HOME CONTACTS THERE ARE BOTH THE STATE AND- SOMETIMES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THEY HAVE INSPECTION PROGRAMS THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF THAT THAT'S JUST THEY DO IT OF ALL PARTS. OF STATE FINANCED OR NOT SO- WE DO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF. WE HAVE QUITE A FEW TOOLS TO SORT OF DEAL WITH THAT BUT IN TERMS OF A GUARANTEED I MEAN IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT. NOTHING WILL FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS EVER BUT WE HAVE QUITE A FEW SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PARTS ARE MAINTAINED OVER TIME. AND THE OTHER THING AGAIN FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE A LOT OF THESE MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE NOT I MEAN MOBILE HOMES ARE NOT COULD BE LASTING FIFTY FIVE YEARS. I MEAN. IF YOU'RE A LOT OF THE PARKS READY HAVE MOBILE HOMES THAT ARE. YOU KNOW HAVE HAD DECADES OLD. AND IT SEEMS THAT IN THE LONG RUN YOU MIGHT POTENTIALLY DISINCENTIVE ISING PUTTING PERMANENT. LOW INCOME HOUSING ON THESE LOTS. IF YOU IF YOU'VE LOCKED UP FOR FIFTY YEARS HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT IN. THE CITY THAT I WAS AND- YOU KNOW THERE WAS ALWAYS THE HOPE. THAT YOU COULD TRANSITION PEOPLE INTO MORE PERMANENT- SAY FOR HOUSING. AND IF YOU'RE LOCKING UP THESE OLD MOBILE HOME PARKS FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS. MIGHT NOT GET THERE WELL SO THE OWNERS ROLE IN THIS IS TO PROVIDE THE SPACES RIGHT AND THEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE PARK IN THE COMMON FACILITIES IT IS THE HOMEOWNERS THE RESIDENTS ACTUALLY BRING THE HOME TO THE SITE AND SO- WE WOULD WE'D BE RELYING ON THE HOMEOWNERS TO. YOU KNOW MAINTAIN THEIR HOME AND OR UPGRADE THEIR HOME OVER TIME THAT DOES OCCUR BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THIS M. PROP PROGRAM ANY CD THAT I MENTIONED BRIEFLY THEY DO HAVE FUNDS AS WELL FOR HOMEOWNERS IN THESE LOWER INCOME PARKS TO BE ABLE TO REPLACE THE HOMES ON OCCASION SO- I THINK THAT. THAT WOULD BE THE WAY THAT WE WERE TRYING TO THAT IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE MOBILE HOME PARKS OVER THE LONG TERM BUT UPGRADE THE HOUSING IN THE MEANTIME BUT YOU DON'T SEE AT SOME POINT THAT IT MIGHT BE ADVANTAGEOUS IF THERE IS VERY LITTLE LAND LEFT IN A CERTAIN AREA THAT THIS MIGHT BE A PLACE TO BUILD A MORE PERMANENT- STRUCTURE. THAT THAT DOES HAPPEN- OPEN TO. HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT- YOU KNOW THAT GENERALLY MEANS IS DISLOCATION AND IT GENERALLY A DIFFERENT GROUP OF PEOPLE COMES AND OCCUPIES THE SITE AND THE ONES WHO LIVED THERE BEFORE SO THAT WAS KIND OF IT. DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN THAT WAY IS NOT HAPPENS WE GO HAPPY TO SORT OF. WORK WITH YOU ON THAT IF THERE'S A IF YOU HAVE AN ITEM THAT YEAH CAN I DO MY MANAGER IF I JUMP IN THEREAS WELL. OF COURSE WELL I WOULD CERTAINLY BE OPEN TO. YOU KNOW YOUR IDEAS AND THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THAT I GUESS WHAT I WOULD OFFER HERE AS WELL IS THAT- YOU KNOW I THINK THE PRIMARY SUSPECT THRUST OF THIS BILL- AT LEAST AS I'VE ALWAYS IMAGINED IT IS SORT OF MULTI FAMILY UNITS AND- IN URBAN AREAS AND WE BROUGHT IN. THE CONCEPT OF MOBILE HOMES BECAUSE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATES THAT THAT MIGHT BE THE ONLY NATURAL. OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT I SUSPECT KNOWING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO THESE MISSION DRIVEN NONPROFITS ARE THAT ARE GOING TO GO GET THE TAX CREDITS FROM THE STATE. THE MOST OF THEM ARE OPERATING IN LARGE URBAN AREAS. FOCUSED ON THESE TYPE OF MULTI FAMILY UNITS I WOULD SUSPECT THAT THE OVERWHELMING THRUST OF THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW. HOLLYWOOD COMMUNITY HOUSING CORPORATION THAT'S GOING TO GO. YOU KNOW WHAT PURCHASE A BUILDING IN HOLLYWOOD TO KEEP A HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS AFFORDABLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. IF THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT THE MOBILE HOME PIECE OF IT CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE WHO WOULDN'T WANT THAT TO. YOU KNOW ANYWHERE INTERFERE WITH WITH WHAT I THINK IS SORT OF THE BROADER SUCH TO THE BILL HERE. GREAT WELL. ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS SO. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE SELLER OF THE PROPERTY- TYPICALLY IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR YOU WOULD TRY TO ROLL THAT INTO A FUTURE INVESTMENT- TO AVOID TAX IMPLICATIONS SO WITH THIS ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT THEY CAN STILL KEEP SOME OF THAT MONEY OUT OF THAT THAT- NEW INVESTMENT SO THAT THEY WOULD PAY A COUPLE GAINES ON WHAT PORTION THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE TO INVEST THEY WANNA SHOUT. THAT'S THAT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND SORT OF LISTENING IN ON THE CONVERSATION HE PREVIOUSLY HAD ABOUT WHY IS A TAX CREDIT EFFECTIVE TOOL TO USE HERE WE THINK IT'S THE PERFECT TOOL TO USE HERE BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE A SELLER WHO'S GONNA SELL THAT BUILDING THEY'RE GONNA DO A TEN THIRTY ONE RIGHT THEY'RE GONNA FLIP THAT TO AVOID TAX CONSEQUENCES INTO SOMETHING ELSE HERE AS MR SHRIVER SAID THEY CAN CASH OUT A LITTLE BIT OF ADEQUATE RIGHT AND SO BECOMES VERY VERY ATTRACTIVE AND IT ACTUALLY GIVES THE NONPROFIT A LEG UP OVER SOMEONE IN THE PRIVATE MARKET. TO ACQUIRE THAT PROPERTY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WOULD YOU. LIKE TO GIVE US ANY CLOSING THOUGHTS NO I APPRECIATE THE- THE ROBUST CONVERSATION AND CERTAINLY OPEN TO ANY AND ALL FEEDBACK AND- YOU KNOW WE FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING. YEAH I THINK IT WOULD JUST BE EXCEPTIONALLY NEGLIGENT FOR THE STATE TO IGNORE. THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING TO LOSE TENS OF THOUSANDS UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE THINK THIS IS A- A MARKET DRIVEN TARGETED WAY TO. TO GET AT THE PROBLEM AND WOOD- I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL AND- YOU WILL NOW BE PRESENTING TWENTY ONE FORTY TWO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- ALSO PLEASE TODAY TO PERCENT. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY TWO. THIS WOULD RE ESTABLISH CALIFORNIA'S EXEMPTION FOR CURSOR. REPLACEMENT REBATES. FROM GROSS INCOME. AND WILL CREATE PARITY FOR TURF REPLACEMENT REBATES WITH OTHER SIMILAR PERMANENT TAX EXEMPTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR WATER EFFICIENCY AND- ENERGY CONFERENCE A- CONSERVATION THE IDEA BEING HERE- THAT WE A LOT OF. WATER DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE HAVE CREATED INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO CONSERVE WATER. AND THEN WE GO AHEAD AND WE TAX THE MONEY THAT THEY GET. IN THOSE REBATES SO WE ADDED A DISINCENTIVE ON TOP OF THE INCENTIVE SO WE ARE WORKING AT CROSS PURPOSES HERE. HI SUE SO KNOWING THAT THE STATE PREVIOUSLY HAD A GROSS INCOME TAX EXEMPTION HERE. KNOWING THAT A LOT OF OTHER TYPES OF WATER CONSERVATION. WE PROVIDE AN EXEMPTION FROM GROSS INCOME. THAT WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO. FURTHER THOSE POLICY GOALS WHICH I THINK ARE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE KNOW THAT. A 100% OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IS IN A MODERATE DROUGHT. ALMOST 90% OF IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS IN A SEVERE DROUGHT. SO ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO. INCREASE THE INCENTIVE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO FOLKS TO TAKE STEPS TO CONSERVE WATER USE WE'VE SEEN THESE PROGRAMS WORK. A LOT UP AND DOWN THE STATE- THIS SEEMS LIKE A MODEST WAY TO. BRING SOME PARITY TO THE LAW- AND ALSO TO FOR HOPEFULLY FOR THOSE PURPOSES SO THAT WE CAN CONSERVE WATER AND ADDRESS THE DROUGHT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND YOU HAVE- TWO WITNESSES I DO I DO WITH THIS IS- BY PHONE WE HAVE ACT KATHY VIA TELE WITH THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN JULIA BISHOP HALL FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. ALL RIGHT. CAN THE MODERATOR PLEASE CONNECT THIS IS THAT CATHY FIRST STORER- JULIA FIRST KATHY PLEASE RIGHT. IS CAPITAL OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAE IS KATHY DID HELEN IN THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- WE WISH TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL FOR OFFERING. OFFERING AB TWENTY FORTY TWO AND RECOGNIZING THAT TOOK THE BAIT AN IMPORTANT TOOL THAT WE USE TO ENCOURAGE CONSERVATION. HELP METROPOLITAN HOTEL WATER TO TWENTY SIX MEMBER AGENCIES WHO IN TURN PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY RELIABLE WATER TO NINETEEN MILLION PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES. AND NINETEEN NINETY WE'VE INVESTED EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION CONSERVATION PROGRAM. RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED WATER SAVINGS OF THREE MILLION ACRE FEET AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO PROVIDE WATER FOR NEARLY TEN MILLION HOMES. ACROSS OUR ENTIRE SERVICE AREA ABOUT REBATE RECIPIENTS ARE MEDIUM TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN AND SB SIX OH SIX. RIGHT HANDER HERTZBERG WHICH LAUNCHED THE STATE ON THE PATH TO MAKING CONSERVATION A WAY OF LIFE. AND INTERNET STRONG COURAGE GREATER WATER USE EFFICIENCY IN HOMES AND BUSINESSES WILL BE KEY TO ENSURE THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE LAWS. YOUR REQUIREMENT REBATES ONCE BENEFITTED FROM A TAX EXEMPTION FROM THAT JANUARY ONE TWENTY NINETEEN UNLIKE THE PERMANENT TAX EXEMPTIONS IN PLACE A WATER SAVING TOILETS AND CLOTHES WASHERS. RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES THAT PARTICIPATE IN A CONSERVATION PROGRAM SHOULDN'T BE TAXED ON TURKEY DAY THEY MIGHT OTHER CONSERVATION REBATES AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY INCENTIVES PROVIDED PUBLIC BENEFIT. CONSERVATION GROUPS WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND IT HELPS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REDUCE ITS RELIANCE ON IMPORTED SUPPLIES. WE KNOW SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO CONSERVE MORE WATER BY FOCUSING ON OUTDOOR WATER USE WHICH HAS BEEN CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOW THAT WE'RE IN THE THIRD YEAR OF WHAT IS SHAPING UP TO BE A HISTORIC DROUGHT. REINSTATING THE TAX EXCLUSION FOR TURF REPLACEMENT WILL FOSTER GREATER PARTICIPATION IN OUR CONSERVATION PROGRAMS ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND HOW WE MANAGE OUR PROGRAMS AND AVOID CONFUSION AMONG THE PUBLIC WHY SOME REBATES OR TAX THAN OTHERS NOT. FOR THESE REASONS. METROPOLITAN SUPPORT EIGHTY TWENTY ONE FORTY TWO AM MEETING THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK FOR. UPON THAT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AND WE HAVE A- JULIA BISHOP. ON NEXT.

FURTHER THE STATE HAS MADE A COMMITMENT TO MAKE MAKING CONSERVATION A CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE AS PART OF THAT COMMITMENT THE ADMINISTRATION IS IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING A ARE YOU SUBJECTED TO CREATE NUMERICAL THAT AGENCIES MUST MEET. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY TWO ADELINE TURF REBATE PROGRAMS AND OTHER PERMANENTLY EXEMPTED WATER EFFICIENCY REBATES FOR TOILETS AND WASHING MACHINE- REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS LIKE THESE OTHER REBATES PLAN IMPORTANT ROLE CONTINUED. WATER EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION EFFORT. FOR READING PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO BE MORE EFFICIENT YEAR ROUND. EVEN WITH INCENTIVES MANY HOUSEHOLD WOULD NEED TO INVEST THEIR OWN INCOME TO REPLACE LAWNS. WITH DROUGHT TOLERANT LANDSCAPING. IMPACTING THESE REBATES IN THE SPECIAL SIGNIFICANT BARRIER FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TO PARTICIPATE AGENCIES HAD A PROGRAM THAT WAS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR LOW pMANY HOUSEHOLD WITHDRAW FROM THE PROGRAM WHEN THEY REALLY BEACH REBATES WOULD BE CONSIDERED TAXABLE INCOME.

QUESTIONS FROM A SHORTAGE OF WHICH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY ONE FORTY TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MADAM CHAIR AT THIS TIME NO ONE IS SECURING UP IN OPPOSITION OF A. B. TWO ONE FOUR TWO THANK YOU DR COURT. YES AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ANY PROGRAM INCLUDING THE OTHER WATER PROGRAMS. THAT ARE BASED UPON EXCLUSION GROSS INCOME AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE PAY VERY LITTLE IN STATE TAXES AND THOSE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR PAID A 13% RATE. SO ALMOST ALL OF THE BREAK BUT YOU GET THE MONEY THAT YOU SPEND GOES TO THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE STATE. AND I PREFER PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE- ON THE REBATES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHERE IT'S YOU LIMIT THE AMOUNT AND AS YOUR INCOME GOES UP YOU GET LASSEN AS YOUR INCOME GOES DOWN YOU GET MORE. I PREFER PROGRAM THAT WORKED THAT WAY I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S FEASIBLE BUT- I JUST DON'T VOTE FOR BILLS LIKE THIS. IN RESPONSE YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU DR CARSON I KNOW WE GOT IT OPPORTUNITY TO CHAT A LITTLE ABOUT THIS. EARLIER TODAY- JUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW PART OF THE REASON THAT THE REBATE IS TARGETED THE WAY IT IS AS IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHO ARE THE FOLKS THAT HAVE THESE MASSIVE LAWNS OR YOU KNOW HAVE THESE BIG WATER BILLS IT'S NOT ALL IT'S NOT A LOT OF LOW INCOME FOLKS RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THE EQUITY CONCERNS BUT IF WE WANT TO. INCENTIVIZE THOSE WHO WHERE WHERE THE GREATEST SAVINGS AS POSSIBLE IT'S LIKELY TO BE TARGETED AT THOSE YOU KNOW FOLKS WHO HAVE REALLY BAG. REALLY BIG HOMES WITH BIG LAWNS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE USING A LOT OF WATER THERE. YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS THEY GET BACK IS PROBABLY. NOT THAT MUCH OF AN INCENTIVE TO THESE REALLY HIGH INCOME EARNERS ANYWAY. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT I GUESS WE'LL ALL IT WOULD OFFER THERE'S I THINK YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF WATER DISTRICTS. TESIFY HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THEY'VE TESTIFIED THAT THEIR EXPERIENCES THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS WORKED AND HELP TO. HELP TO SAVE WATER AND SO- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- FROM FROM FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AND IT ALSO JUST OFFER HERE IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC BENEFIT HERE. SAVING THE WATER BENEFITS EVERYBODY RIGHT THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO PROVIDE A TAX REBATE TO- SOME HIGH INCOME FOLKS IT'S TO HELP EVERYBODY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WERE ADDRESSING OUR WATER ISSUE AND SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S TARGETED TO A SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE. THE BENEFIT OF THIS BILL I THINK IS VERY. IS VERY BROADLY TARGETED THANK YOU. I'M SO. HAPPY TO BE A CHARACTER THAT I. COULD I MAKE A- GOOD I REPLIED TO DOCTOR BURKE THIS IS KATHY. WELL I'M- pIS THIS ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES O. OKAY. PLEASE I'M I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND TO DR PARK QUESTION BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO EXPLAIN HOW THE METROPOLITAN PROGRAM WORK AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF THE REBATE SO IT'S CURRENTLY TWO DOLLARS AFTER SQUARE BUT AFTER FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET FOR RESIDENTIAL I'M HOME SO THAT IS THE MAXIMUM- REBATES WOULD BE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WE USED IN THE PAST IN THE PREVIOUS DROUGHT WE DIDN'T HAVE A CAT AND SO THERE WILL REPORT YOU KNOW THAT- WEALTHY HOUSEHOLDS WITH LARGE LARGE AREAS WERE BENEFITING FROM THE PROGRAM BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE CASE ANY LONGER THE AVERAGE SIZE. OF THE TRUCK REPLACEMENT REBATES THAT PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROGRAM IS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET AND SO THE MAJORITY OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN OUR PROGRAM ARE USUALLY AND I THINK I SHARED A STATISTIC WE SAID ABOUT 68% OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM FOR SORT OF LOW TO MEDIAN INCOME HELPFUL FOR THAT. THAT'S WHO WE ARE TARGETING RIGHT NOW. BUT THEN THEY GET LITTLE TOO BY AS WELL THAT. LOOK THIS IS JUST SOMETHING I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR THE- SIX ZERO EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE BUT THANK YOU. I I'M JUST CURIOUS THAT PRICE TAG ON THIS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY LOW SO I ASSUME THAT'S BECAUSE- MOST OF THESE REBATES ARE NOT REPORTED TO THE IRS WITHOUT THE CORRECT. IT THAT'S PROBABLY RIGHT. AND DID YOU THINK THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ARE THEY ISSUE TEN NINETY NINES BY ANY OF THE WATER AGENCIES YOU KNOW I'D HAVE TO LET THE WATER AGENCIES SPEAK TO THAT BUT I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT FOLKS PROBABLY GET CONSERVE CONFUSED RIGHT I MEAN THEY'VE THEY'VE- PUT IN. A WATER EFFICIENT TOILET THEY PUT IN A WATER EFFICIENT WASHING MACHINE THAT'S EXCLUDED FROM GROSS INCOME SO THEY MAY NOT KNOW SO PART OF THIS IS JUST ABOUT CREATING YOU KNOW UNIFORMITY AND CONSISTENCY WITH THE WAY THAT WE TREAT THESE ROAD REPAIRS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THE WITNESSES WANT TO. WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT. YES NATALIE ALL THOSE ISSUES. ALL RIGHT JOINT KATHY. WHAT DOES IT ALL OF OUR MEMBERS. THIS IS SOMEBODY SPEAKING OR DID I. DO WE ARE ABDUCTED HELD FOR METROPOLITAN WE DO ISSUE A TEN NINETY NINE AND THEY'RE ALSO NOTIFIED THAT THEY'LL BE RECEIVING A TEN NINETY NINE WHEN THEY ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH I THINK YOU MANAGER I GUESS WE JUST WANT TO- MAYBE CLARIFY TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT. I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT TURF REBATES WHICH IS TO MAKE CLEAR THIS IS NOT. JUST A REBATE AND OFTEN IS. IN IN IN MANY CASES NOT A REBATE FOR INSTALLING PLASTIC TURF THIS IS ABOUT RIPPING UP GRASS OR SOMETHING ELSE AND PUTTING IN. DROUGHT TOLERANT LANDSCAPING OR TRICKY DRIP IRRIGATION SYSTEMS OR SOMETHING ELSE I KNOW WHEN PEOPLE HEAR TURF THEY MAY BE THINKING ONE THING- BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLEAR FOR FOLKS. AND THEN I GUESS THE FINAL THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT YOU KNOW. I'M IN CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH FOLKS WHO'VE MADE THIS DECISION PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THE NOTION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE MONEY PEOPLE LIKE THE NOTION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO GOOD AND DO WELL AT THE SAME TIME. AND I THINK THAT IS A POWERFUL MOTIVATOR FOR PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR AND THAT THEY CAN FEEL REALLY GOOD LIKE THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FOR THE STATE AND GOOD FOR THE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT ALSO SAVING. A FEW BUCKS IN THE PROCESS SO WITHOUT. APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GABRIEL. ALL RIGHT OUR NEXT ITEM IS AGENDA ITEM FIVE AB SEVENTEEN OH TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I EXPECTED TO STAY HERE UNTIL THE VERY END SO- GRATEFUL TO GET THIS GONNA MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY- WHENEVER THIS DOES COME UP FOR A VOTE- ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WILL WILL TAKE THEM AB SEVEN ZERO TWO WOULD SUSPEND SALES TAXES ON RETAIL PURCHASES OF COBIT NINETEEN HOME TEST KITS IN HIGH QUALITY FACE MASKS. THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COVERED NINETEEN CASES IN CALIFORNIA HAS REACHED NEARLY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION WHILE THE STATE WIDE MASK MANDATE HAS RECENTLY BEEN LIFTED MASTER STORE REQUIRED IN MANY PLACES SUCH AS ON PUBLIC TRANSIT AIRPORTS IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS OF COURSE WE'VE ALSO HEARD OF NEW VARIANTS THAT MAY REQUIRE US TO MASK UP YET AGAIN WARY MASKS AND USING AT HOME TEST KITS IS ESSENTIAL TO STOPPING THE SPREAD OF CODED. CALIFORNIA SHOULD PRIORITIZE REDUCING ECONOMIC BARRIERS THAT PREVENT RESIDENTS FROM PURCHASING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THIS BILL SEEKS TO HELP ELIMINATE A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING DURING THE PANDEMIC TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT IS SOMETHING CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF DOING TO FURTHER SUPPORT RESIDENTS HEALTH. CALIFORNIA EXEMPTS A LARGE NUMBER OF MEDICAL RELATED EQUIPMENT FROM STEALTH SALES TAX SUCH AS CRUTCHES CANES FIRST AID KITS WHEELCHAIRS AND MORE AND WE SHOULD NOT CREATE ANY MORE RESTRICTIONS FOR THOSE LOOKING PROTECT THEMSELVES AND OTHERS AGAINST COVE I PROVIDING A TEMPORARY TAX EXEMPTION FACE MASKS AND AT HOME TEST KITS IS A SMALL WAY WE CAN HELP CALIFORNIANS BETTER PROTECT THEMSELVES AND OTHERS.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORBIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM HOUSTON- HAVE TO SAY FOR A FIRST LADY MADAM CHAIR VERY HEARTENED BY THE CONVERSATION TODAY AND REALLY APPRECIATE A LOT OF THE DISCOURSE AROUND. STATES PRIORITIES AND VALUING- TARGETED PROGRAMS AND IT IS FOR THOSE VERY REASONS BUT AT THE TIME WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSED TO AN ON THAT MEASURE- BAND- I AS HAS STATED A NUMBER OF MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL- ISSUES THAT DO RECEIVE. A TAX INCENTIVE FOR CONSUMERS HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLE HERE THAT DON'T KEEP AND POINT YOU KNOW SO- THERE ARE JUST SOME BEHAVIORS THAT FOLKS. ARE GOING TO DO REGARDLESS AND OTHERS ARE NOT AND CERTAINLY THE STATE IS THEN HEATED CONVERSATION AMONG VOTERS ABOUT- CODE NINETEEN AND HOW TO MOVE FORWARD IN IN TERMS OF THEIR RESPONSE AND SO IF THE AUTHOR CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE PATHWAY WE WOULD SIMPLY ASK THAT HE WHO ARE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE TARGETED- PERHAPS LOOKING INTO AND YOU. BRING THAT AS MR PERKINS MENTIONED A VARIETY OF TIME TODAY THERE'S A GRANT PROGRAM OR SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY NARROW DOWN TO THAT CALIFORNIANS THAT NEED BE PRODUCT AND ARE FOR OTHER REASONS UNABLE TO ACCESS THEM- RATHER THAN SIMPLY DROPPED. A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR HAND OUT TO A LOT OF FOLKS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD ALREADY BE PURCHASING KNOWS THESE PRODUCTS HELP I HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH THE OFFICE OFFICE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING SO AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD- BUT FOR THOSE. REASONS REMAIN IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. RIGHT HIS CAR ANYBODY THE ROOM WHICH TO SPEAK. IS THERE ANYBODY ON THE LINE IN OFFICE. MISTER CAN I HAVE THE- MODERATOR PLEASE CHECK FOR OPPOSITION. ON YES IF YOU WHICH IS. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. ONE SEVEN ZERO TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND I'M SURE WE DO HAVE ONE THAT IS LATE QUEUING UP ONE MOMENT PLEASE. AND WATER LINE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THAT'S ONE ONE FIVE YEAR ONE IS OPEN. TRANSAMINASE THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES YEAH I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO PROTECT. THE LOCAL RAGE WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO POINT OUT AND LEADERSHIP ON THE MATTER- WE- ARE ALL OF OUR- THANK YOU BANG OCTOBER THE LAST COMMENT OPEN AT THE OUT THERE CAN FIND MORE TARGETED- WAY TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO NEED THE SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. RIGHT THANK YOU A QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER CLARK. SO MY CONCERNS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME ISSUE TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION I PREFER A MORE TARGETED PROGRAM I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE SPEAKER IN PRO TEM THEY BASICALLY SAID LOOK WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST TAKE. THE GAS TAX AND GIVE PEOPLE A REBATE ON THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE WILL ACTUALLY DECREASE THE PRICE. STEP WE'RE GOING TO GIVE ALL THOSE FOLKS YOU LOWER INCOMES MONEY AND PHASE OUT THE PROGRAM OVER. INCOME SO THAT'S THE KIND OF APPROACH I PREFER IN THIS CASE THANK YOU. YEAH IT THANK YOU DOCTOR CREEK I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THE ISSUE- WITH THE GAS TAX ARE FOR SO I THINK IT WAS A SOME. COST OF LIVING RELIEF FOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA- THAT REALLY ISN'T JUST ABOUT GAS IS JUST THE COST OF LIVING AND INFLATION IS UP AND- PEOPLE NEED RELIEF AND YOU REALLY NEED TO TARGET THAT. BUT THE ISSUE ON THE GAS TAX ITSELF WAS BECAUSE FOR OVER A DECADE THERE HAVE BEEN SURCHARGES THAT GAS STATIONS AND OIL REFINERIES CANNOT JUSTIFY. AND THAT IF WE WERE TO NOT CHARGE- YOU TARGET OUR GAS TAX THAT WE HAVE THAT'S THE ONE. THAT THERE IS NO PROOF THAT THAT SAVINGS WOULD GET PASSED ON TO ANYONE AT THE GAS PUMP THEY WOULD JUST MAINTAIN- THE SURREAL HIGH GAS PRICES THAT- THAT WE CAN'T ACTUALLY RATIONALIZE. UN ON THIS ISSUE THOUGH I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE- DIFFERENTLY- BECAUSE I RESPECT YOUR APPROACH PARTICULARLY ON ON THE ITEMS TODAY IS THAT THESE ARE NOT LUXURY GOODS WERE EARLY ADOPTERS ARE THE ONES WITH MONEY. THIS IS TO USE THE TERM SURREAL. A NECESSITY FOR EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA THAT NO ONE HAD TWO YEARS AGO. AND SALES TAXES THE MILK BOWL THE PROBABLY THE MOST REGRESSIVE TAX THAT WE HAVE AND SO THIS IS PROBABLY THE BIG EASIEST WAY TO TARGET I ACTUAL SAVINGS AT THE TILL. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING THINGS THAT PERHAPS IT OTHERWISE RATHER HAVE THAT TEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR SOMETHING THAT IS NOT MORE IMPORTANT BUT IS ALSO IMPORTANT- AND SO THIS IS A WAY TO SAY LOOK AN EEVEE CHARGER- MAYBE FOR GONNA TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE COULD PROTECT LIFE- BUT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THIS AND WE AND THIS IS A REASON TO- MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS THE EASIEST WAY TO PASS THOSE SAVINGS ON- AND- AND SO I RESPECT THE- POINT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE. BUT I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T USE THE GAS TAX AS THE EXAMPLE FOR THE SIGN I ENJOYED HAVING THAT TYPE OF A- ABILITY TO ARGUE WITH YOU ON- THE SEMANTICS OF THAT SO THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU- I WOULD JUST SAY IF YOU'RE GIVING LOW INCOME PEOPLE MONEY THEY CAN DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR HEALTH WHICH MIGHT BE MORE FOOD OR PAY THE RENT WHATEVER BUT IN AND WILL AGREE TO DISAGREE YEAH YOU KNOW BUT I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH YOU LIKE YOU KNOW WHATEVER THIS GAS FAKE A GAS TAX REBATE THING IS GOING TO BE THAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY UPI AND WE'RE WE'RE GONNA BE GIVING MONEY TO PEOPLE. AND HELP THEM MAKE THOSE GOOD CHOICES BUT THIS IDEA I LIKE THE LAST OPPOSITION HAD THIS TAX WINDFALL SALES TAX WINDFALL ON THESE ITEMS DID NOT EXIST IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY- AND SO TO SAY- MORE OR SOMEHOW TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE POCKETS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE SALES TAX I THINK IS A MISTAKEN BUT THANK YOU. AND WE WILL CONTINUE DISAGREE ON. OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MR LEVINE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH THIS WAS A LOT OF FUN I DO APPRECIATE THE DEBATE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN THAT MOMENT IN TIME COMES UP FOR ALL OF US THANK YOU SO MUCH COMMITTEE.

SO ITEM ELEVEN SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE IS REMOVED ALL BY THE AUTHOR OF MOVED BY THE AUTHOR ALL RIGHT. THIS ROAD ON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY SEVEN. INSTEAD OF IS THE PRODUCTION OF CRUCIAL EQUIPMENT TO ARTS SUPPORTER SUPPLY CHAIN BY ESTABLISHING A 6% TAX CREDIT FOR MACHINERY USED TO MANUFACTURE. INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT AND ITS COMPONENT PARTS. WITH THE IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN WITH THE INCREASING CONSUMER DEMAND DURING THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY CALIFORNIA'S PORTS ARE SEEING UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF CARGO CONGESTION YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS. WITH CONTAINERS PILING UP AT OUR PORTS AND AN UNPREDICTABLE SHE AND UNPREDICTABLE SHIPPING TIME SHE COME IN MORE COMMON WE ARE FEELING THE EFFECTS OF A GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS. THIS ISN'T UNIQUE TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT IS GLOBAL ONE FACTOR THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED THIS CRISIS HAS BEEN THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT CHASSIS IS C. OF THE BOX THE CONTAINER THAT GOES ON TOP OF THE CHASSIS. AND THE CHANCES OF THE WILL WITH THE FRAME ON THEM. AND A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE SO WE DON'T OF TRUCK DRIVERS THAT MAY BE THE CASE IN SOME INSTANCES BUT OFTEN IT IS REALLY THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CHASSIS IS TO PUT THE CONTAINERS ON AND GET THEM OUT OF THE PORT OR MOVE THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE. THIS EQUIPMENT HELPS TAKES GOODS FROM OUR PORTS AND MOVES THEM FURTHER DOWN THE SUPPLY CHAIN TOWARD THEIR ULTIMATE DESTINATION. THE DEMAND FOR THIS COMMITMENT AS A OUTPACED SUPPLY WORLDWIDE MAKING IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR OUR PORTS TO GET THE CHASSIS IS THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED THEM. BUT MAJORITY AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE CHASSIS IS ARE MANUFACTURED. OVERSEAS AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING FOR OUR ECONOMY OR REALLY OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. IN ORDER TO AVOID FUTURE EQUIPMENT SHORTAGES AND DROUGHT AND DR JOB JOB CREATION WE TO HELP FOSTER INCENTIVIZE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURER OF THIS EQUIPMENT. AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY SEVEN WILL HELP OUR CHASSIS DOMESTIC MANUFACTURE IT WILL HELP CHECK- DOMESTIC CHASSIS MANUFACTURING BY PROVIDING A TAX CREDIT ON THE MACHINES NEEDED TO PRODUCE THIS CRITICAL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. AND JOINING ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS MIKE JACOB VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION AND I BELIEVE LIKELY ON FOR ON THE PHONE IS MARTHA MILLER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA SOURCES ASSOCIATION OF PORT AUTHORITIES. HI BUT GOOD AFTERNOON MIKE JACOB PMSA- AND- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR A LONG **** COME IN SUPPORT. MISTER DOLLARS MEASURE TODAY- AS HE SAID WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A SPY CHEN CRISIS EVERYONE. IS QUITE A LETTER WHERE OF ALL THOSE ISSUES- BUT CERTAINLY ONE OF THEIR- MAJOR COMPLICATING FACTORS IS THE LACK OF INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT ACCESSIBILITY- OUR CONTAINERS FRANKLY JUST DON'T MOVE UNLESS WE HAVE WILL SITES- THOSE. REAL SETS ARE NOT PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES AND- THE IRONIC OUTCOME MOST OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY IS THAT IN ORDER TO MOVE. INTERNATIONALLY PRODUCED MANUFACTURED GOODS WE NEED MORE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCTION- WE'RE LEFT WITH A- A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE ASKING THIS BODY- TO CONSIDER LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO ADDRESS THE SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS BUT ONE OF THEM. IS TO ACCELERATE MANUFACTURING AT HOME OF THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT. MANUFACTURERS INVESTMENT CREDIT IS A WELL KNOWN WELL UNDERSTOOD MECHANISM FOR ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE- AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT MOVING FORWARD WHEN IT'S TIME TO DO SO. THANK AND THEN YOU CAN WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE CONNECT US WITH MARTHA MILLER. THANK YOU MARTHA. IF YOU COULD SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. OR MOVE A LITTLE. BACK. ONE SECOND I'M COMING UPON COMPLEMENT OF. OUR THAT. LITTLE BETTER. VERY OUTRAGEOUS PEOPLE OUT- I'M AS YOU KNOW I MARTHA MILLER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY'S ADDITIONAL COURT ATTORNEYS IN HERE TODAY I DID ARE STRONG SUPPORT FOR A BI TWO TWO TWO SEVEN WHICH ADDRESSES ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUE FACING THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN BY INCENTIVIZING MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE CHASSIS THAN THE OTHER KEY INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. HOME TO THE MOST PRODUCTIVE SYSTEM OF PARTS NATION OUR PORTS OUR SPONSOR FOR HANDLING ABOUT 38% OF ALL CONTAINERIZED IMPORTS IN 20% OF ALL EXPORTS THE COVETED NINETEEN PANDEMIC CREATED A SURGE IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR CENTRAL CUTS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY CONTAINERIZED CARGO VOLUMES GREW ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT. SPECIFICALLY OUR NATION INSPIRED CHASSIS THAN OTHER KEY INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP WITH RISING CONSUMER DEMAND DURING THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC FOR DECADES AMERICAN TRACKING MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR WORKERS WERE FORCED TO COMPETE AGAINST FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS THAT WERE HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED BY THEIR GOVERNMENTS IN TURN TERRORISTS IMPOSED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE. AVAILABILITY OF INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT FROM CHINA. FOR OUR PART BECAUSE- SPECIFICALLY- CAL AGAR. EXPORTERS ACCESS TO INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT IS CRITICAL WITHOUT AVAILABLE CHASSIS TO MOVECARGO FOR MURDOCH'S MARC STERN CAN CONGESTION AND DELAY. AND IMPEDING CALIFORNIA'S EXPORT CAPACITY. THAT IS WHY OUR STREETS PUBLIC PARKS STRONGLY SUPPORT INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF CALIFORNIA MAY TRY TO THE MARKETPLACE INCENTIVES LIKE TENTS ARE NEEDED. HAVING ACROSS THE NATION CAPA ALONG WITH OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE GOODS MOVEMENT SECTOR AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CAL STYLE. AND I'M CDFA PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPPLY CHAIN THE CUSTOMER WHICH IS HOW TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE CONGESTION IN THE FALL I'M ONE OF THE KEY OUTCOMES OF THE SUMMIT WAS TO FIND WAYS TO SOLVE FOR THE CURRENT EQUIPMENT SHORTAGE THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING. THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET TO SOLVING THE SUPPLY CHAIN AS MIKE MENTIONED WE'RE LOOKING FOR POSITIVE SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN DO TO KIND OF TACKLE A LOT OF THE COMPLEX ISSUES HERE AND WE BELIEVE THAT AB TWO TWO TWO SEVEN DOES THAT- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP- THE PHONE BROKE DOWN ON THIS ISSUE AND HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTION. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN THE ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK UP. SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF ALL THE MODERATOR NOW PLEASE OPEN THE MAIN LINE FOR SUPPORTING TESTIMONY. I'M SURE IF YOU WHICH SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO TWO TWO SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WE'RE GONNA GO TO LINE NUMBER THANK. I'M GONNA GO TO LINE NUMBER FIFTY SEVEN FIVE SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU PRESS. PRESS UNION FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU OVER LINE NUMBER NINETY EIGHT THAT'S NINE EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN. AFTER MANAGER MEMBERS BURNING MINISTRY GABI HAVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION I WANT TO THANK OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER DONALD FOR THIS CRITICAL BILL AND WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY SEVEN. AND MADAM CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. AND IT IS ANYBODY ON THE PHONE LINES THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO TWO TWO SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MADAM CHAIR AT THIS TIME NO ONE ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK SO IN READING THE ANALYSIS. FOR MANY REASONS THEY GIVE WHY THEY THINK THIS WOULD BE A- NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN BRINGING ON MORE MANUFACTURING CALIFORNIANS SIMPLY RESULT. IN A TAX BREAK FOR THE MANUFACTURING THAT'S ALREADY HERE WHICH MIGHT NOT BE A BAD THING BUT- DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT AS TO HOW EFFECTIVE YOU THINK THIS BILL WOULD BE- GIVEN THE ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF RAISING THE TAXES IMPORT TAX ON THE- CHINESE CHASSIS IS IT CENTER. WELL ALTERNATES ORDER MR JAGAN JUST A MOMENT BUT I THINK THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW IS WERE BEHOLDEN. TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO EVEN MOVE OUR GOODS IN NORTH AMERICA SAD SITUATION THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS IS JUST ONE WAY. TO ADDRESS IT BUT MAYBE MISTER JACOB WHICH TO COME FURTHER YEAH THANK YOU MISTER KIRK A CORK FOR THE- QUESTION WE'RE WE'RE REALLY LEFT WITH NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO ASK US MANUFACTURERS TO STEP UP PRODUCTION AND I. I GET THAT THAT'S THE HEART OF YOUR QUESTION- WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS THAT INVESTMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN CALIFORNIA- WE BELIEVE THAT- NOT JUST THE ACTUAL- CHASSIS. ASSEMBLER BUT THE ACTUAL COMPONENT MANUFACTURERS NEED TO BE STEPPING UP FOR THIS WE ARE AT A CRITICAL DEFICIENCY IN THE NUMBER OF CHOICES WE HAVE IN THE MARKETPLACE RIGHT NOW- AND ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO SPUR THAT ALONG AS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SO. IT MAY NOT BE A PERFECT SOLUTION- AND THE LONG TERM- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR- ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS THAT ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE MANUFACTURED WHETHER YOU HAVE TERRORISTS OR NOT OR WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE THIS. THIS TAX CREDIT OR NOT- BUT WE ARE ARE. REALLY GRASPING AT STRAWS- WE HAVE A CRISIS WE HAVE. NOT ENOUGH PIECES OF EQUIPMENT TO MOVE THE AMOUNT OF CARGO WE HAVE SITTING ON OUR DOCKS RIGHT NOW- WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHASSIS THAT ARE OCCUPIED. BY EMPTY CONTAINERS BECAUSE LOADED CONTAINERS DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO MOVE THEM OFF THE DOCK- SO WE ARE ASKING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP US. GET TO A PLACE WHERE THAT'S A LEVY ADDED IN A NORMAL SITUATION WITHOUT- THE PANDEMIC. I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE ASKING FOR THIS BILL. WE'RE IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE NO OTHER PLACE TO TURN EXCEPT THE U. S. DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS WE NEED THEM TO RAMP UP AS SOON AS I CAN. THAT IS BUT IS THIS THE BEST APPROACH TO DO THAT IS JUST THE BEST WAY TO SPEND THE MONEY IS REALLY THE QUESTION. AND I CAN'T ANSWER THAT BUT PERHAPS YOU COULD. IT THAT IS THE THAT IS DEFINITELY THE QUESTION WE'RE GOING TO- ASK- YOUR LAST ANSWER THAT IN THE- IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN- THIS IS THE TOOL THAT WE'VE USED IN THE PAST TO SPUR MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT. AND HAS IT WORKED. I BELIEVE SO OKAY BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE FILM INDUSTRY ALONE. IN LA THERE'S A TAX CREDIT FOR FILMING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S BEEN A TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. AND THE PROOF WILL BE IN THE CHASSIS IS PRODUCED. A THIS IS. JUST KIND OF PICKING UP ON THAT AND AGAIN IN THE FALL WITH ANY THE BILL ANALYSIS SO THERE'S FIVE CHASSIS MANY CORRECT ME IF ANY OF THIS IS INVESTORS FIVE CHASSIS MANUFACTURERS IN THE UNITED STATES THERE'S ONE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WOULD ONLY APPLY TO MANUFACTURERS THAT USED TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA SO IS THE GOAL OF THIS BILL TO INCENTIVIZE THE ONE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURER TO AFTER PRES MORE STUFF HERE OR IS IT TO INCENTIVIZE THESE OTHER FOR OPERATORS TO ESTABLISH A PRESENCE IN CALIFORNIA YEAH IT'S BOTH- AND IT'S- SPECIFICALLY TO INCLUDE BOTH OF THOSE FOLKS WHO DO THE FINAL ASSEMBLY AND COMPONENT MANUFACTURERS- SO THAT'S EVERYTHING TIRES BRAKES AXLES- WHEEL SETS ALL THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO IT- AND- ALL OF THESE FOLKS- WHETHER YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE. THOSE FIVE ORIGINAL FOLKS FROM OUT OF STATE OR THE CALIFORNIA- COMPONENT ASSEMBLER- NEED TO PRODUCE MORE- WHAT WE'RE REALLY ASKING FOR WITH RESPECT TO CALIFORNIA'S THAT'S A NEW ENTRANT- THEY JUST SET UP SHOP POST TARIFF- AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. WE'RE ASKING EVERYONE RAMP UP- AND DO THAT BY INVESTING IN MORE EQUIPMENT HERE- SO. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF OF THIS IS SITTING ON SUSPENSE AND WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT PROCESS IS IDENTIFYING EXACTLY HOW MANY COMPONENT MANUFACTURERS ARE ALREADY OPERATING IN THE STATE WE DON'T KNOW THAT- BUT WE DO KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE S. ASSEMBLER WHO'S BEEN SET UP IN CALIFORNIA AND I WAS IN TWENTY TWENTY AFTER THE- THE- TARIFFS- SO. IT'S A IT'S A MARKET THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE GROW WE HAVE TO INCENTIVIZE GROW. THANK YOU. JUST LIKE FOLLOW UP ON THAT AS SETTING UP A BRAND NEW MANUFACTURING IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE DO YOU THINK THIS IS ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE THE COMPANY TO SET UP HERE- WELL WE HOPE SO I THINK THAT TO DOCTOR QUIRKS QUESTION- THE REAL INCENTIVE IT IS A COMBINATION OF THE SAND AND THE TARIFFS- UP UNTIL THE IMPOSITION OF THE TARIFFS. RELATIVELY SPEAKING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION IS VERY VERY VERY SMALL AND WE DID NOT HAVE ANY DOMESTIC PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA- SO. THE ANSWER IS WE DON'T KNOW- BUT WE HOPE SO AND WHAT WILL BE WORKING WITH WITH FOLKS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME NUMBERS TO GIVE- TO EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND- IN THE LEGISLATURE MOVING FORWARD. AND AGAIN I WOULD WE WANT TO THE MANUFACTURER DOESN'T CREDIT PATH BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WE WANT PEOPLE TO DO WE WANT PEOPLE ARE MANUFACTURING THIS PEOPLE QUITMAN TO INVEST IN THE EQUIPMENT NECESSARY- TO THE PRODUCER. IS THE COMPANY THAT'S HEARING WHAT COMPANY IS IT IS AN AMERICAN COMPANY IT IS A- ASCENT IT'S A NEW SUBSIDIARY COMPANY OF ONE OF THE FOREIGN- MANUFACTURERS FROM ASIA. THANK A BLOCK FROM THE MARKET IN CHINA SO WHETHER YOU LIKE THAT THE TERRORISTS ARE NOT- DALY CITY THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS AND RESHORING. SOME MANUFACTURING FROM OFFSHORE TO THE UNITED STATES OF THAT COMPANY DECIDED TO STAND UP TO ASSEMBLY PLANTS ONE IN CALIFORNIA ONE IN VIRGINIA. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OF. MISSED I THINK I CALLED YOU MCDONALD AT THE BEGINNING I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT MISTER ODUM AND I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR SEVEN YEARS I APOLOGIZE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. RIGHT NOW I JUST LIKE TO THINK OF A FIRST ALL THE MODERATOR AND ALSO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO THAT'S WHEN I VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON FROM. YOUR PRESENTATION AND I THINK WE HAVE. OF MR PATTERSON- NEXT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY WITH AB. SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN. WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT MEMBERS OF THE- OF THE COMMITTEE- FIRST AYE AYE I WANT TO. YOU TO KNOW THAT I'VE READ THE IN THE- DRAFTING CONCERN ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS WE'RE WORKING TO AMEND THAT AND MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR THE INTENT TO. TO FIX THAT THIS BILL AB SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN WILL PROVIDE PARENTS WHO'VE EXPERIENCED A STILLBIRTH WITH A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ASSIST WITH ASSOCIATED MEDICAL AND BURIAL AND OTHER COSTS- IT'S ESTIMATED THAT EVERY YEAR THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND STILL BIRTHS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN CALIFORNIA SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED STILLBIRTHS- WHICH MEANS- TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. A PREPARE TO HAVE A CHILD AND BOUGHT CRIBS AND DIAPERS. LOWS MAYBE AND MAYBE SET UP. NURSERIES THERE MAY HAVE- EVEN CARRIED THE OTHER BABY PASSED TO DO THE DUE DATE- BUT DID. FIND OUT THAT THE BABY WAS BORN WITHOUT A HEARTBEAT. THESE PARENTS DID HAVE TO- INDOOR CONSIDERABLE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP WITH RESPECT TO MEDICAL EXPENSES A FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS- THE COST OF GRIEF- SB SIXTY NINETY SEVEN WE HOPE IF YOU CAN PROVE IT WILL HELP SHOULDER SOME OF THESE. COSTS DURING A DIFFICULT- AND DEVASTATING CRIME. TO PUT IT INTO A BIT OF- PRIORITY CONTEXT END UP TO THE CAP OF TWO THOUSAND WERE TAKEN BY THE- NINO SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF- THE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED- STILL BIRTHS ON AVERAGE THIS IS MAYBE FOUR AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS- I JUST LIKE TO COUNTER POSE THE HEAD WITH THE PROJECTED FORTY FIVE. BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS WE PRESENTLY HAVE- OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL CANNOT TAKE AWAY FROM THAT LOSS THAT THESE FAMILIES HAVE EXPERIENCE BUT IT CAN PROVIDE SOME RELIEF FOR FAMILIES. IN NEED- I HAVE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT DANIELLE OAKLAND WITH THE- STAR LEGACY FOUNDATION AND GAVIN FERGUSON WHO FOUNDED THE NONPROFIT PHOEBE'S FUND WITH HIS WIFE FOR A SUPPORT TESTIMONY. AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITH MODERATOR FIRST CONNECT US TO MR FERGUSON. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. MR FERGUSON YOUR LINE IS ON ME TO GO AHEAD. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. YES WE CAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN FOR ALLOWING ME TO- BE HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHY I SUPPORT A. B. SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN THANK YOU ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY. AND THAT BRINGING- SUCH AN NEEDED BILL TO CALIFORNIA- AGAIN MY NAME IS GAVIN FERGUSON AND I'M ALL MORNING RADIO SHOW HOST HERE IN SACRAMENTO ON ONE OF SIX FIVE THE ACT. MY DAUGHTER PHOEBE WAS DUE ON AUGUST SIXTH TWENTY FIFTEEN PHOEBE HAD A TOTALLY NORMAL PREGANCY. OUR DOCTOR EVEN JOKED- QUOTE SHE'S READING THE TEXTBOOK AND THEIR NEEDS TO FAIL THE TIME. THEY DO DATE CAME AND WENT AND WE ANXIOUSLY WAITED FOR HER TO SHOW SIGNS THAT SHE WAS READY TO COME OUT. AND ON AUGUST ELEVENTH WE WENT IN FOR A ROUTINE APPOINTMENT AND TO DISCUSS WHEN WE WOULDN'T DO THIS. WE JOKED WITH THE DOCTOR WHEN HE CAME AND SPOKE WHEN THE DOCTOR HAD TROUBLE FINDING PHOEBE'S HEART BEAT. ALL THE JOKING STOPPED. AFTER SEARCHING FOR ALMOST A MINUTE HE FINALLY HEARD A HEART BEAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF RELIEF. THAT THE DOCTOR STILL LOOKED NERVOUS. YOU TOOK MY WIFE'S WRIST ENCOUNTERED HER HOLES AND SAID THAT HE WAS PICKING UP HER HEART BEAT AND NOT OUR BABIES. HE QUICKLY PULLED HER OVER TO ANOTHER ROOM THAT CAN ALTER FOUNDED STARTED TO LOOK AT OUR DAUGHTER SHE SOON AS HE HAD HER ON THE SCREEN WE CAN ALL SEE THAT HER LITTLE HEART WAS NO LONGER FEED. HE THEN LOOKED AT US AND SAID THE WORST WORD THAT ANYONE COULD SAY TO A PERSON. I'M SORRY BUT YOUR BABY HAS DIED. WE WERE AT FORTY WEEKS WERE ACTUALLY PAST FORTY WEEKS. EVERYTHING WAS FINE UP TO THAT POINT THERE WAS SCREAMING AND CRYING FROM MY WIFE AND I FOR MONTHS. I'LL SPARE YOU THE DETAILS BUT NO THAT THAT LEVEL OF GRIEF FELT FROM PARENTS WHO HAVE NEVER NEVER GET TO HOLD THEIR BABY. HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL WITH NOTHING IN THEIR ARMS LIVE IN A HOUSE WITH AN EMPTY NURSERY THAT THEY BUILT IS A PAIN THAT NO ONE IS EQUIPPED TO HANDLE. AND OFTEN SWALLOWS COUPLES HOLD. THIS IS WHY AB SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN IS SO IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH THAT PARENTS HAVE TO SURF THE WAVES OF GRIEF AND FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES MORNING IS CHILD BUT THEY NEVER GET TO WATCH GROW UP. THEY ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH UNEXPECTED EXPENSES THAT ADD INSULT TO INJURY. LIKE FUNERAL COSTS BURIAL OR CREMATION COSTS. WORKING AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE SO THERE'S A LACK OF INCOME IN SOME CASES. SOME COUPLES NEED TO LEAVE THEIR HOUSE OR TOWN FOR A BIT IN ORDER TO COLLECT THEIR THOUGHTS TO BE ALONE. ARABY IS ESSENTIAL IN MY OPINION WHEN IT COMES TO MANAGING NOT ONLY GRIEF BUT POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. AND IT IS OFTEN NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. AND FINALLY THE MOST ROBUST MEDICAL EXPENSES TO PAY FOR THE BIRTH OF A BABY THAT YOU NOW HAVE TO BURY. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES INFANT MORTALITY HAS SUCCESSFULLY DECLINE HOWEVER STILL BIRTH HAVE YOU KNOW. THEIR MYSTERIOUS AND WHAT CAUSES THEM AND THE NUMBER OF HIDDEN DANGERS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN OUR DAUGHTER PHOEBE LAINGSBURG THEN WAS ONE OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STILLBIRTHS IN AMERICA. IT'S FAR MORE COMMON THAN PEOPLE REALIZE AND THE PARENTS OF THOSE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND. BORN STILL EVERY YEAR NEED HELP. MY WIFE AND I ARE VERY LUCKY PEOPLE WE WERE ABLE TO HANDLE ALL THOSE EXPENSES BUT WE KNOW MANY PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T AND HAD TO CHOOSE WHICH CRUCIAL HEALING EXPERIENCE THEY WERE GOING TO BUY PASSED. BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT CHILD THE WAY THAT WE AND SO MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD TO DO IS THE WORST THING A PERSON CAN GO THROUGH SO WHATEVER ANYONE CAN DO TO MAKE IT LESS TERRIBLE IT'S TRULY A BLACK. YOU ALL HAVE THE-POWER TO DO THAT. PEOPLE LIKE US NO THAT NOTHING WILL EVER BRING OUR FEEDBACK BUT KNOWING THAT PEOPLE WANT TO HELP AND WILL NEVER FORGET HER IS MORE HEALING THAN MOST REALIZE. NO GRIEVING PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MONEY AFTER LOSING THEIR CHILD. I'M WHILE TRYING HARD TO NOT LOSE THEMSELVES SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLEASE APPROVED AB SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN DO WHAT YOU CAN FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME AND MY WIFE. AND AFTER LIKE THIS GOES MUCH MUCH FURTHER THAN YOU THINK AND CAN FROM. THANK YOU BE SOMETHING THAT HELPS IN A TIME WHEN THESE PEOPLE FEEL HELPLESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS MR FERGUSON WITH A- DANIELLE DANIELLE OAKLAND PLEASE. HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THINK YOU'RE SOME WOMEN PATTERSON OR GET IT BILL IN ACTION THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR TO SHARE MY TESTIMONY MY NAME IS DANIEL AUCKLAND AND I'M A MOTHER AND LIKE ANY OTHER PARENT MY HUSBAND AND I COMPARED FOR OUR SON JUDE ARRIVAL WITH SUCH LOVING DETAIL WE PLANNED IN GATHERED EVERYTHING DUDE MIGHT NEED WE FOLLOWED ALL THE STEPS. WE TOOK ALL THE CLASSES. WE WERE EXCITED WELCOME OUR BEAUTIFUL BOY INTO THE WORLD. WHAT WE WEREN'T PREPARED HAVING TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THINGS LIKE TO THE AUTOPSY CREMATION AND FUNERAL. ON NOVEMBER TWENTY THIRD TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN JUDE AND EXPLICABLE YOU DIED AND WAS BORN IN THAT ORDER. I GAVE BIRTH TO DEATH. BECAUSE OF THAT SO MUCH WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US. IT WASN'T GIVEN AND ID BAND OR AN ANKLE MONITOR TO CONFRONT AN OBJECTION. IT'LL FIND THE HOSPITAL MAKES TO ANNOUNCE THE BIRTH WAS OVERLOOKED SO HE WAS FULL TERM DO DID NOT GET A BIRTH CERTIFICATE BUT A CERTIFICATE OF DEATH. WHEN WE LEFT THE HOSPITAL WE DID NOT BRING JUNE HOME WE PAINFULLY LEFT ABOUT THE MARK. I HELD THE BOXES OF MEMENTOS INSTEAD OF MY SON. WHEN THE TIME CAME TO FILE TAXES THAT YEAR WE WERE BLINDSIDED AGAIN WE HAVE THE EXPENSES JUST LIKE ANY NEW PARENT HAD IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAD UNTHINKABLE EXPENSES TO FACTOR AND- NOT QUALIFYING FOR THE CHILD TAX CREDIT WAS LIKE SALT IN OUR WOUNDS THAT WOULD NEVER HEAL. AS A LOT OF PARENTS EITHER EXCRUCIATING OMISSION. IT COMMUNICATES TO US THAT OUR CHILD DOESN'T COUNT. OUR CHILDREN WERE BORN STILL BUT THEY WERE STILL BORN. SO THIS WILL NEVER HEAL THERE ARE WAYS TO EASE THE BURDEN TO RECOGNIZE WHAT WAS LAW. HONORING THE IMPACT OF STILL BIRTH WITH A TAX CREDIT COULD EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR MANY FAMILIES. IT HONORS AND ACKNOWLEDGES WHAT WAS LOST IN A CONCRETE WAY. SO OUR CHILDREN BEAUTIFUL LIVES WERE CUT SO HORRIBLY SHORT THEY'RE WORTHY OF BEING COUNTED. THAT'S WHAT ALL THE LOS PARENTS CAN HELP FOR. PLEASE VOTE YES ON AB ONE SIX NINE SEVEN FOR ALL THE BABIES WHO DESERVE TO BE COUNTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MRS ARTLAND ROOM BUT WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

AB SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN. BUT THAT WE'VE EXHAUSTED THE QUEUE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT- YEAH I UNDERSTAND THERE IS- ONE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION WITH MODERATOR PLEASE CONNECT US WITH SAMANTHA CORBIN FROM THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION. YOU'RE FREE THIS WEEK. THANK YOU SIR MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MET THE CARBON WITH THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM AND THE BANK THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE AND TO THE PARENTS WHO TOOK THE TIME TO CALL IN AND SHARE THEIR GRIEF TODAY I IN SEVEN TO EIGHT YEARS OF WORKING ON THESE ISSUES CANNOT IMAGINE THE BILL I HAVE. NOT WANTED TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO MORE- AT THE TIME EACH YEAR A IS OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE THAT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS WE DISCUSSED THE NEED TODAY IN A VARIETY OF TAX POLICY MATTERS TO TARGET VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND ENSURE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE MOST IN NEED WHILE PRESERVING OTHER CRITICAL PROGRAMMING. AND WHEN GENERAL FUNDS ARE UTILIZED TO SERVE ANY SPECIFIC PROFESSOR OF COURSE NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO MEET OTHER STATE PRIORITIES INCLUDING SUPPORTING PARENTS AND CHILDREN IN DIRE NEED ACROSS THE STATE. IT'S TRUE WE DO HAVE A VERY LARGE SURPLUS THIS YEAR- BUT THAT MEASURE IT NOT JUST FOR THE SHARING WHAT IMPACT THE STATE BUDGET FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WHEN THE ECONOMY MAY BE FAR LESS CERTAIN- THAT SAID ONE OF THE PARENTS WHO SPOKE EARLIER TODAY BROUGHT UP A VERY FAIR POINT REGARDING THE FACT THAT PARENTS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH STILLBIRTH. DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE CHILD TAX CREDIT- THAT I FOUND VERY COMPELLING PERSONALLY I WILL JUST SAY- HOWEVER EVEN THE CHILD TAX CREDIT IS TAILORED TO CERTAIN FAMILIES. WHO ARE IN MOST NEED OF THE CREDIT ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS. TO DO LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO THE AUTHORS OF THE SPONSORS. TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE OR POTENTIAL MEASURES- EXCUSE ME AMENDMENT. TO FURTHER TARGET THE MEASURE THANK YOU. FOR ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE MAIN LINE FOR ANY OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. THANK YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB ONE SIX NINE SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. THE MANAGER THERE'S NO ONE SHOWING UP IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINES THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK YES ALSO I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE WAY THIS WOULD BE ADMINISTERED I REALLY THINK IT IS ASKING TOO MUCH OF A PARENT WHO HAS LOST A CHILD TO KEEP RECEIPTS AND THEN SIX MONTHS LATER BUT IN A TAX RETURN IT JUST THE PAIN WOULD BE TOO MUCH I MEAN I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE. HOW AWFUL YOU WOULD FEEL AT THE TIME AND HOW. HI KEEPING RECEIPTS MIGHT BE THE LAST THING ON YOUR MIND. SO I WOULD PREFER IT THE OTHER THING IS IF YOU REALLY ARE KEEPING RECEIPTS AND THERE ARE AUDITED AND THIS AND THAT. IT REALLY RAISES THE COST OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. I WOULD THINK A BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO TAKE SOME SORT OF A STANDARD. APPROACH AND THAT PERHAPS MIGHT BE THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. JUST MAKING PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT- AS YOU SAID IN YOUR STATEMENT- IF YOUR LIFE FOR ONE MINUTE YOU GET THE CHILD IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE FAMILY TO TAKE THE- THE TAX CREDIT AND IF THEY'RE STILL BORN THEY'RE NOT. THAT SEEMS. MMHM I'M JOSH TO ME AND I THINK AN APPROACH ALONG THOSE LINES WOULD WORK BETTER BOTH IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATION AND- AND ALSO TARGETING AS WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION SO THANK YOU ARE SIR- ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON YOU CERTAINLY BROUGHT UP SOMETHING WE ALL SHOULD BE AWARE OF. BUT AGAIN- I KNOW THIS IS- SORT OF PRELIMINARY- AND- AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITIES AND I THINK THAT. WHAT WE ARE ABOUT. IS AN IRAQ ACTUALLY KIND OF THEM SYMPATHETIC WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE RECEIPTS AND ALL OF THAT- AND IT DID STRIKE ME AS- UNFAIR- THAT IF IT'S STILL BARNETT. DOESN'T QUALIFY FOR THE CHILD TAX CREDIT- WE HAVE OP OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. ADD TO CRAFT AMENDMENTS WERE MADE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE HAVE THE- PRIMER SPACE TO ESSENTIALLY REWRITE BUT IF THERE'S AN INTEREST IN. WORKING ON THIS AS SUGGESTED BY MR QUIRK. UP WE WOULD LOVE TO CHECK IN WITH- THE SUPPORT GROUPS AND THOSE WHO WERE- CALLING IN SUPPORT I WOULD ADD THAT- ALONG WITH THE CATHOLIC- THE CONFERENCE. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH SYSTEM IS IN SUPPORT THAT'S THE BIG COMMUNITY HOSPITAL IN FRESNO IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA IT'S AND THE AND- AND ALSO THE VALLEY CHILDREN'S HEALTHCARE THAT'S THE BIG CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN. FRESNO CALIFORNIA AT THE END IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA- WHAT THE CHAIR PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE AS TO HOW WE MIGHT PROCEED. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO TALK TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND SEE IF THERE'S ONE SOME WAY TO- THE REFOCUS- THE BILL IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE LESS BURDENSOME ON THE PARENTS. I MEAN EVEN LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE- GRIEF COUNSELING OR- GAS LOOKING AT THE CHILD TAX CREDIT I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY THAT- THAT'S AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO I AM NOT ACTUALLY HOW THAT WOULD WORK BUT I'M NOT NOT NOT NOT TO. BE ARGUMENTATIVE ABOUT IT BUT WE HEARD. A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT FROM INDIVIDUALS MUST QUICKLY DID IN FACT GO THROUGH. THAT PROCESS AND SUPPORTING A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO- YOU KNOW QUALIFY FOR THE TAX CREDIT THEY THEY WERE THEY WERE IN FACT IN SUPPORT- HAVING HEARD THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE COULD DO THIS WITH A- WITH A TAX. CHILD TAX CREDIT- I'M I'M WILLING TO GO DOWN A PATH. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH WITH THE COMMITTEE. IF THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD WE COULD WE COULD WORK THROUGH. SHARES LET'S HAVE YOUR STAFF TALK TO THE COMMITTEES OF AB AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOME OKAY. AGAIN I THINK. THE. THIS IS A SOMEWHAT OF A FINITE COSTS ANOTHER WORDS WORK ON AVERAGE I THINK WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED OF THE STILLBIRTH IN CALIFORNIA SO AGAIN IT'S ABOUT A FOUR FOUR AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. NUMBER THAT HOWEVER WE COULD HELP WITH THOSE BURDENSOME QUALIFY FOR THEM- BUT IS IT AS SIMPLE AS- THE DECLARING THAT A STILL STILLBIRTH IS A BIRTH AND SHOULD QUALIFY FOR A TAX CUT CHILD TAX CREDIT. AND MAYBE MAYBE THAT IS AN ANSWER HI I'M LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION- AND WILL CONSULT WITH WITH YOU AND WILL CONSULT WITH THOSE THAT ARE IN SUPPORT. AND SEE IF THAT CAN IT CAN SCAN SOLVE YOUR CONCERNS AS WELL AS- BRING SOME DEGREE OF RELIEF AND SOME DEGREE OF A- HELP OUT FOR THE FOR THE FOR THIS KIND OF A I'VE AYE UNUSUAL CIRCUMCISED PREACH HATE YOUR COMPASSION ON THE ISSUE AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T DO THIS FROM THE DIET I UNDERSTAND YOUHAVE. SOME TIME TO LEARN IT WOULD ALSO AS ONE OF THE PEOPLE CALLED IN STATE WITH IT WOULD SUPPLIER THE RECOGNITION THAT THIS WAS A REAL PERSON. GOOD POINT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE TIME I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH AND FOR THE VERY CAREFUL AND- SERIOUS THOUGHTFUL AND COMPASSIONATE CONSIDERATION OF THIS THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT YOU HAVE BEEN SO- PATIENTS MS QUIRK-SILVA- SO- CAN YOU COME UP AND- PRESENT AB TWENTY FIFTY FOUR PLACE. FIRST I WANTED TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEW CHAIR ASSEMBLY WOMAN- JACQUI IRWIN NO IT'S QUITE EXCITING AND GOOD EVENING INSTEAD OF MY NOTES THAT SAY GOOD AFTERNOON BUT HEY WE KNOW THAT TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK WHEN WE NEED IT TO BUT I WANT TO ALSO THANK THE CONSULTANTS WHO HAVE WORKED ON. ANALYZING THIS BILL I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIFTY FOUR THE BILL WHICH CONFORMS TO CURRENT STATE TAX CODE TO FEDERAL TAX CODE CONCERNING FEDERAL TAX EXEMPT FIVE OH ONE ORGANIZATIONS THAT'S A LONG SENTENCE BUT IT'S BASICALLY- ALIGNING TAX CODE CURRENTLY ONE IN MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES ACCEPTS A GRANT FROM THE STATE THOSE FUNDS ARE. SUBJECT TO BE TAXED THOSE TAXES ARE THEN PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMERS SOME OF WHOM ARE SENIOR CITIZENS ON FIXED INCOMES OTHER DISKS AND IN OTHER DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS AND FROM RURAL. COMMUNITIES THIS BILLS AIMING TO FOCUS ON THE UNDERSERVED WATER DISTRICTS THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT SO THAT MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES CAN QUALIFY FOR THE FEDERAL TAX EXEMPT STATUS AND NOT PASS ON. ADDITIONAL COSTS TO CONCERNED CONSUMERS THAT ARE ALREADY TAX FOR THEIR WATER SERVICES. THAT WE HAVE I BELIEVE ONE PERSON IN THE QUEUE TO TESTIFY A CIGAR OTHER WITNESS JUMPED OFF BUT WITH ME HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MISTER DON ORTEGA WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES. THE STRATEGIC ORTEGA. A MERRY GO AHEAD YES PLEASE THANK YOU TO IRWIN AND VICE CHAIR NGUYEN- MY NAME IS AN HONOR TAKE I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES WE REPRESENT FOUR HUNDRED NEUTRALS IN CALIFORNIA. AND OUR MEMBERS ARE IN EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA UNDER CALIFORNIA CORPORATION CODE MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES OR NOT FOR PROFIT COMMUNITY OWNED WATER SYSTEMS THEY CAN ONLY SERVE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH TOGETHER OWN THE COMPANIES AND SHAREHOLDERS. GIVEN THAT MANY MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES EXISTENCE OLDER RURAL AN OLDER URBAN AREAS MANY MUTUAL SERVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. UNDER THE STATUS QUO ACCEPTING STATE GRANTS IN IMPLEMENTING SOME CONSERVATION MEASURES WOULD REQUIRE RESIDENTS SERVED BY THE MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES TO PAY TAXES. IF THE MUTUAL EXCEPT STATE GRANTS AND OR- INSTALLED BOB METERED WATER SALES OR EARN INTEREST ON RESERVE ACCOUNTS FOR MAINTENANCE AS MANDATED BY STATE LAWS. WE ARE ASKING FOR A YES VOTE AND PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY FIFTY FOUR BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S TAX LAW TAX LAWS DO NOT CONFORM TO FEDERAL BIBLE ONCE HE TWELVE TAX EXEMPT DESIGNATION FOR MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THE BILL HAS PERFORMANCE PROVISIONS THAT ARE SURE THAT THOSE WHO WILL REALLY NEED IT WOULD QUALIFY FOR TAX EXEMPT STATUS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE SUNSET PROVISION FOR TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT THIS IS A KEY FACTOR WITH THE STATE'S FOCUS ON THE CURRENT DROUGHT CRISIS AND HELPING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AB TWENTY FOUR AB TWENTY FIFTY FOUR WILL HELP TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR MANY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE STATE AND FEDERAL GRANTS THAT WILL HELP OUR DROUGHT RESILIENCY AND SAFE DRINKING WATER GOAL.

YES SIR GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GENE TALMADGE AND I AM A RETIRED NAVAL OFFICER I LIVE IN CAMARILLO AND- I HAD ELECTED TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN I DID RETIRE FROM THE NAVY- BUT I UNDERSTAND THE- THE NEEDS THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE. OF NON AFFORDABILITY. I WAS ABLE TO WORK FOR A STATE AGENCY AFTER RETIRING FROM THE NAVY. BUT MY INTEREST IS HERE AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT. A. B. SIXTEEN TWENTY THREE AND I THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAINBOWS FOR HIS SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS SPONSORING THE BILL. AND- I WOULD HOPE ALL OF YOU. I SHARE THE SAME INTEREST AND CAN APPROVE OF THIS BILL AND HAVE IT MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THE QUEUE FOR SIXTEEN TWENTY THREE IN FAVOR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS OF A- SPEAKING AGAINST THE BILL OF WILL YOU PLEASE CONNECT US TO SAMANTHA CORBIN FROM THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS CAN'T THE KOREAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORMS THAT MEASURE- THE STATE DOES HAVE A VARIETY OF DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS TEACHERS FIREFIGHTERS LAW ENFORCEMENT. SCIENTISTS NURSES- ONE COULD CERTAINLY ARGUE THEY'RE EQUALLY DESERVING OF GRATITUDE FROM THE STATE AND AS A MATTER OF TAX POLICY IT'S UNCLEAR IF THERE'S A COMPELLING REASON AT LEAST RIGHT NOW TO SINGLE OUT ONE SERVICE POPULATION OVER ANOTHER AND THE RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. MOREOVER AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED NUMEROUS TIMES TODAY BECAUSE THE GENERAL FUND WOULD SEE REDUCE DOLLARS AS A RESULT OF THE MEASURE IT COULD REDUCE SERVICES OVER TIME TO THOSE MOST IN NEED- THE MEASURE THAT CLAIM THAT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR EMPLOYERS AND CALIFORNIA IS ATTRACTING A QUALIFIED WORKFORCE- AND LOOP THAT APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THOUSAND UNFILLED HIGH TECH JOBS ARE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIGHLY SKILLED SERVICE RETIREES- BUT IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THE MEASURE IS ONLY APPLICABLE TO QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS OVER SIXTY YEARS OF AGE. UNCLEAR IF THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD CHOOSE TO OR EVEN WOULD BE ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK- OR THAT THEY WOULD DO SO IF THEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE TAX INCENTIVES- THEREFORE QUESTIONABLE THAT ONE OF THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE BILL- WOULD EVEN BE MET THROUGH THE BILL ITSELF AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CARBON ANYBODY. IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION. AND MODERATOR OPEN MAINLINE ANY OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE SP ONE SIX TWO THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND THE FINAL REMINDER PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO. AB. SIXTEEN TWENTY THREE. AND NOBODY IS QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COURT YEAH. SO PERHAPS YOU COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION I'M ALSO. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A BAD THING TO HAVE PEOPLE MOVE OT OF THE STATE WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS. AND PARTICULARLY FUEHRER ARE OLDER AND RETIRED AND YOU DON'T NEED TO LIVE NEAR A BUSINESS- SAY THE TEN SAN DIEGO IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO MOVE OUTSIDE OF THAT AREA. AND HAVE THE HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED TO COMMUTE TO THAT HOUSING- I KNOW THAT SOUNDS. DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT BUT- THERE IS A HOUSING SHORTAGE AND IT'S A REAL BIG CONCERN AND INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO STAY. A MAY NOT BE THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE IT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M NOT SURE THAT QUESTION IS DIRECTLY ASKED THEM IF I COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. BUT SHOULD I ADDRESS THIS QUESTION FIRST FOR HIS COMMENTS WHATEVER YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AS FAR AS OPPOSITION IT TALKED ABOUT- NOT REALLY FOR FILLING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER- THE ARGUMENT IS THAT IT ALSO WILL SERVICE ON A PLAN OF RETIREMENT THOSE THAT ARE DISCHARGED FROM THE MILITARY THAT DO GO INTO. THE SKILLED WORKFORCE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR RETIREMENT PLANNING TO AUTOMATICALLY GET TO THAT POINT WHERE THEY COULD THEN BENEFIT FROM THE EXEMPTIONS- MOVING FORWARD. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THAT QUICK- WHEN PEOPLE ARE DISCHARGED FROM THE MILITARY THEY DO- ATTAIN GI BILLS TO OFFER THEM TO PURCHASE HOMES SO IT DOES HELP THE HOUSING COMPONENT TO FOR OUR MILITARY. THAT ARE THERE I THINK. THIS BILL IS JUST I THINK IT'S NEEDED I THINK IT'S- A BILL THAT- NEEDS LONG AWAITED AND OVERDUE- ADVOCACY- AND DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE- SO I DO BELIEVE THAT- WITH SOME OF THE OPPOSITION- I'M TALKING ABOUT. THEY MENTION THAT SIXTY YEARS PLUS THEN WILL THEY BE PART OF THE SKILLED WORKFORCE BUT I WOULD HAVE TO- MENTIONED THAT THAT'S PART OF A RETIREMENT TOOL AS FAR AS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO RETIRE. IN THE STATE THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO- BE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO STAY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND RETAIN THT KNOWLEDGE HERE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOURPRESENTATION I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING WORDS. I JUST I BELIEVE. THAT THIS IS JUSTIN AND I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE. I THINK- HONORING OUR MILITARY AND THE SURVIVORS THE FAMILIES THAT ARE THERE I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. WARRANTS SOME DISCUSSION AND I WILL MAKE MYSELF AVAILABLE MADAM CHAIR TO ANY FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THIS MATTER AS THIS PROCESS CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. REALLY APPRECIATE YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. FINALLY WE ARE ON OUR LAST ITEM MR ROD REGUS A FILE ITEM TEN AB. SEVENTEEN OH NINE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT A. B. SEVENTEEN ONLINE AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AMERICAN RED CROSS RECENTLY DECLARED ITS FIRST EVER NATIONWIDE BLOOD CRISIS AS BLOOD BANKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FACE ONE OF THE WORST BUT SHORTAGES IN DECADES. MANY HOSPITALS ARE ONLY RECEIVING A QUARTER OF THEIR NEEDED BUT WHICH FORCES DOCTORS TO CHOOSE WHO RECEIVES CARE IMMEDIATELY AND WHO MUST WAIT. AND MORE DIRE CASES HOSPITALS ARE UNABLE TO TREAT ANYONE. FOR EXAMPLE HARBOR UCLA MEDICAL CENTER LOCATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOW TO CLOSE THEIR TRAUMA CENTER FOR TWO HOURS AND EARLY JANUARY BECAUSE- THEY EXHAUSTED THEIR BLOOD INVENTORY. THIS BLOOD SHORTAGES ALREADY CAUSING- DIRECTLY CAUSING OTHERWISE PREVENTABLE LOSS. OF LIFE AND I SURE SCHRODER TO THINK THE LOSS WE WOULD FACE IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR DISASTER EMERGENCY. AB SEVENTEEN OH NINE ONE KURDS MORE DONATION BY PROVIDING A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR NET TAX CREDIT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DONATE BLOOD. FOUR TIMES IN THE CALENDAR YEAR AND AUTHORIZING CAL OH YES TO CREATE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT COULD PROVIDE MORE DISSONANT INCENTIVES FOR CALIFORNIA'S TO DONATE BLOOD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OKAY A SO- ANYBODY ANY WITNESSES IN THE ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND AN THE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINE FOR THE MAIN LINE FOR SUPPORTING TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF YOU'D LIKE TO TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN ZERO NINE. PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME WHEN FALL BY ZERO TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT FOR A BI SEVENTEEN OH NINE. ONE MOMENT PLEASE WE HAVE A COUPLE QUEUEING UP.

THANK YOU MY NAME IS DESIREE SMITH AND I'M A RESIDENT OF NORTH COUNTY SAN DIEGO AND I'M INSUPPORT OF AB SEVENTY NINETY NINE. EIGHTY SIXTEEN- TWENTY BE THAT WITH EARLIER- BUT MY SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY SEVENTEEN OH NINE FOUR- THE TAX CREDIT FOR DONATING BLOOD IS IT SUPPORT- AND I AND I STAND BY MATT- BECAUSE YOU'RE A MORE MILITARY HERE I BELIEVE I DON'T HAVE ANY FIGURES TO BACK IT UP BUT I BELIEVE THEY'RE PROBABLY MORE DONORS. BECAUSE A LOT OF THE MILITARY MEMBERS DONATE HERE AND SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF MILITARY PEOPLE HERE AND IT WOULD BE A BENEFIT FOR THEM THEIR DONATING A LOT AND THEY'VE LIVED HERE IN A VERY EXPENSIVE STATE TO LIVE IN. AND SO ANY ADVANTAGES THAT CAN COME TO THEM FROM HAVING LIVED HERE AND AS THE SURVIVING SPOUSE OF MILLET MILITARY SURVIVING SPOUSE MYSELF LOOKING FOR LITTLE REASONS TO STAY. ARE ARE ARE GOOD. THAT'S IT. AGAIN I'M IN SUPPORT OF IT. RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY LIKE YOUR BOOKS WILL. ANY OTHER WITNESSES INSPECT BETTER. WE HAVE ONE MORE ALLY TO ELEVEN YOU ARE OPEN. YES HI MY NAME IS DR RECAPS FLUORIDE I AM LIFESTREAM BLOOD BANK'S PRESIDENT CEO AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR I'VE WORKED IN TRANSFUSION MEDICINE BLOOD BANKING FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. LIFESTREAM IS A NONPROFIT BLOOD BANK THAT HAS BEEN IN OPERATION FOR OVER SEVENTY YEARS PROVIDING BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS OVER EIGHTY HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL FACILITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS APPEAL PATIENT NEED LIKE YOU MUST COLLECT FIVE HUNDRED BLOOD DONATIONS A DAY. CURRENTLY LIFESTREAM BLOOD BANK AS WELL WHAT CENTERS ACROSS THE NATION ARE EXPERIENCING THE MOST SERIOUS BLOOD SHORTAGE IN HISTORY KOPEN NINETEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR INDUSTRY PEOPLE ARE NOT COMING IN TO DONATE AS MUCH AS THEY WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THESE ARE ATTACKS WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT HELP WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE HAD LESS THAN A ONE DAY OF SUPPLY OF RED CELLS AVAILABLE. FOR MOST OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AND A GOOD PORTION OFTWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO AND MANY OF OUR HOSPITALS OFTEN HAVE HAD DAYS WITH LITTLE OR NO CRITICALLY NEEDED TYPE OF RED CELLS ON THEIR SHELVES THIS IS A NATIONAL CRISIS AND WE ARE UNABLE TO RECEIVE HELP FROM OTHER BLOOD CENTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PATIENTS CANNOT AFFORD TO THE SHORTAGE TO GO ON FOR MUCH LONGER IT IS NOT ONLY RED CELLS THAT ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED A PLATE LOOKS AS WELL PLATE WITH HER SPECIAL AND SCARCE RESOURCE MANY PATIENTS INCLUDING ADULTS AND CHILDREN BATTLING BLOOD IN OTHER CANCERS. DESPERATELY NEED FREQUENT BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS TO SAVE THEIR LIVES TAKEN HAVE PLAYED LET'S HAVE A VERY SHORT SHELF LIFE OF ONLY FIVE DAYS AND COMBINED THE ONGOING BLOOD SHORTAGE IN DEMAND FROM LOCAL HOSPITALS IT REQUIRES US TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PLATELETS PRODUCTS WE COLLECT. TO PROVIDE AN AMPLE SUPPLY TO OUR COMMUNITY EVERY TWO SECONDS SOMEONE NEEDS BLOOD HOSPITALS WITHOUT ENOUGH BLOOD PRODUCTS SUPPLY WILL LIKELY CANCEL LECTIN SURGERIES AND MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH BLOOD TO SEVERE TRAUMAS. WE NEED HELP FROM OUR COMMUNITY AND AB SEVENTEEN OH NINE COULD HELP FACILITATE THAT THE BILL'S FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR TAX CREDIT FOR TAXPAYERS MAKE A LEASE FOR DONATIONS OF HUMAN WHOLE BLOOD OR HUMAN BLOOD COMPONENTS WOULD BE NEEDED INCENTIVE FOR DONORS. WE GET T. SHIRTS GIFT CARDS AND OTHER EMOTIONAL. BUT IT'S NOT A AND SO A PERSON. AND WE- COMPETE. THE FOR PROFIT PLASMA CENTERS THAT COMPENSATE DONORS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. CURRENTLY OUR LOCAL BLOOD DONORS AVERAGE SLIGHTLY LESS THAN TWO BLOOD DONATIONS A YEAR. EIGHTY SEVEN TO. EIGHTY SEVENTEEN OH NINE COULD HELP US DOUBLE OUR DONATION RATE. THE NON-PROFIT BLOOD CENTERS OF CALIFORNIA ARE AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. IN ATTRACTING. DONORS AND AB SEVENTEEN ON I CAN HELP. THE TAX CREDIT WOULD BE A HUGE HELP TO SAVING THE LIVES OF PATIENTS. AS WELL AS HELPING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES IN NEED ESPECIALLY DURING THE ONGOING AND CONTINUING PANDEMIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN THE UP WAS THAT THE LAST WITNESS IN SUPPORT PARTICIPANTS CUED UP MEDICARE ALL RIGHT WE HAVE ONE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. MISS CORBIN. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL LIMIT MY COMMENTS SIMPLY TO SAY THAT OUR CONCERNS THAT THIS MEASURE BY THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM REPATRIATION OR SIMILAR TO OUR CONCERNS WITH MR LEVINE FRAZIER. ON A SIMILAR TOPIC AND WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WAYS TO TARGET THE MEASURE TO THOSE IN NEED WITH THE LEAST IMPACT ON THE GENERAL FUND. THANK YOU. RIGHT ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION LOWOF WITH MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE MAIN LINE FOR ANY OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION FOR A B. SEVENTEEN ZERO NINE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. THIS PRESS ONE ZERO TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVENTEEN ON. AND I'M SURE NOBODY IS QUEUING UP I THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORE YES LONG DAY- SO I USED TO BOB DONATE FOUR TIMES YEAR WHEN I WORKED AT LARGE FLAVAN. ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS FOR IT. BESIDES THAT THEY GAVE OUT DONUTS- WAS THAT IT WAS VERY CONVENIENT. AND THAT THEY WOULD COME FOUR OR EVEN MORE TIMES A YEAR TO THE LAB BECAUSE THEY GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING IN IT WAS ENCOURAGED. THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THIS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR TAX CREDIT AND I'M GLAD IT TO CREDIT NOT A DEDUCTION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT. I THINK THAT'S A MORE APPROPRIATE WAY TO GO- IS THAT GOING TO BE. THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO SPEND THAT MONEY. YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM JUST ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM WHAT KIND OF PROOF FOR YOU CAN HAVE IT CETERA- SO THAT'S A QUESTION THAT I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT IN THE BILL BUT- MY QUESTION IS THIS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO SPEND THE MONEY WOULD IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO SAY FROM THE BLOOD BANK. TO MAKE MORE MOBILE CALLS. I DON'T KNOW. WELL THE WE'RE LOOKING AT IT NOW I MEAN WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO THINK MORE CREATIVE HOW WE GET MORE PEOPLE TO DONATE BLOOD OBVIOUSLY. THIS IS A CRISIS THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN DECADES SO I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK ACOSTA DIFFERENTLY HOW WE CAN GET INCENTIVIZE MORE PEOPLE COME OUT TO DONATE BLOOD WE CAN DO THE DIGITAL BLOOD BANKS AND WHATNOT BUT IF WE DON'T GET MORE PEOPLE OUT TO THOSE BUT BANKS ARE KIND OF DEFEATING THE PURPOSE BUT I THINK THIS IS JUST ONE WAY. TO LET FOLKS KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INCENTIVE FOR CONDONING BUT IN ONLY FOUR TIMES IN ONE YEAR SO I THINK IT'S THE BEST APPROACH BUT I'M OPEN TO ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS OR COMES AT. ANYBODY MALE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH AND- DO YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE AND WE CAN HELP SAVE SOME LIVES THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. WE HAVE ANY. ALL RIGHT. WELL WITH THAT I AM A JOHN THAT THIS MEETING THANK.
