INFLUENCE BY PARTIAL PARTIES

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:05.988

EMPLOYEES OF THEIR RIGHT TO A

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:10.593

THIS BILL IS SO THIS SPECTER OF

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:17.920
BOOK OF LACK OF SECRECY LACK OF

A SECRET BALLOT. IS RHETORIC.

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:22.925

KNOW IN THESE KINDS OF

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.544
ELECTIONS WHAT'S REQUIRED IS A

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:44.213
NUMBER OF YES VOTES ESSENTIALLY

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.181
JUST LIKE HERE. WE HAVE THIS

01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:48.851
HABIT OF STAYING OFF OF A- BUT

THE SECRECY. IS PROTECTED I

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.769
WOULD ARGUE EVEN STRONGER IN

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:08.604
THIS CASE. BECAUSE THE

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:10.306
FARMWORKER DOESN'T HAVE TO GO

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:13.008
INTO POLLING PLACE. WHICH IS AT

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:15.077

SECRECY OF THAT BALANCE. SO IT

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:37.933
IS A IN FACT A SECRET BALLOT.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.835
IN A PROCESS THAT IS MEANT TO

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:42.304
FACILITATE THE ABILITY OF

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:42.905
FARMWORKERS TO MAKE DECISIONS

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:44.506

OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHY WE

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:54.383
HAD WE CHECKED THIS WITH. THEN

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:55.250

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.116
BUSINESSES IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:28.951
TO CHARACTERIZE THE MOTIVES ARE

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:30.853
STATEMENTS OF OTHERS AND HOW

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:32.454
THEY GOT THERE BUT I THINK YOU

DECREASE THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:33.015

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:35.384
YOU YOU COULD EXPLAIN WITH ALL

01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:36.952
THESE ACCUSATIONS THAT SOMEHOW

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:55.771
THOSE KINDS OF ACCUSATIONS DOES

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.773
THAT CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THIS

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.908
BILL OR MAYBE YOU CAN TALK

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:01.510
ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT. HI I

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:03.612
HAVE A HARD TIME ANSWERING FOR

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:05.647
SOMETHING I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.249
AND I DON'T SEE IN THIS BILL.

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:09.251
CORES IN AS LONG BEEN A

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:12.254
CHALLENGE IN UNION ELECTIONS

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:14.423
AND THAT PRESSURE COMES FROM

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:17.159
BOTH SIDES. AND THE REASON THAT

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.461
WE SET UP THE VOTING PROCEDURES

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:21.764
WE HAVE IS TO ALLOW FARMWORKERS

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:23.766
TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. AT

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:26.101
THE TIME OF THE ELECTION. ALL

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:27.970
WE'RE DOING HERE IS GIVING THEM

01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:28.537
THE ABILITY TO FILL OUT THAT

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:31.840
BALLOT. AND MAIL IT IN ON THEIR

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:34.343
OWN TIME IN THEIR OWN WAY UNDER

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.512
THEIR OWN CONTROL. THAT'S

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:39.114
SUPPORT THIS BILL. WHAT I JUST

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:40.883
WANT TO ADD ON HAVING BEEN

01:13:40.949 --> 01:13:44.286
THROUGH MANY MANY UNION- WITH

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:47.356
WORKPLACE ELECTIONS- THE IDEA

01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:49.491
OF BEING ABLE TO VOTE IN THE

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:52.961
PRIVACY OF YOUR HOME- IS QUITE

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:55.397
EXTRAORDINARY AND I THINK

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:57.533
BEGINS TO BALANCE YOU TALK

01:13:57.599 --> 01:14:00.402
ABOUT THE POWER OF COERCION

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:02.404
IT'S NOT A CO WORKERS THAT

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:05.374
COURT CHORUS ME- IT'S WHO HAS

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.942
THE POWER TO FIRE ME OR WHO HAS

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:09.444
THE POWER TO. TAKE OTHER

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:11.847
ACTIONS AGAINST ME THAT'S REAL

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:14.950
POWER OF COERCION- BUT- HAVE

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:17.052
YOU BEEN THROUGH MANY MANY

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:18.854
HUNDREDS OF WORKPLACE

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:22.658
ELECTIONS- BEING ABLE TO FILL

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:26.628
OUT YOUR BALLOT AT HOME- TAKE

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:28.797
YOUR TIME. NOBODY'S THERE OR IF

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:29.832
YOU WANT SOMEBODY TERE IF YOU

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:31.333
DON'T WANT WHATEVER YOU WANT

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.202
IT'S AND YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:35.370
YOUR HOME. WHICH IS REALLY

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:37.673
DIFFERENT FROM HAVING TO WALK

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.408
INTO THE WORKPLACE. FOR THE

01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:42.244
MANAGEMENT EMPLOYER ARE ALL

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:46.782

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:10.072
COULD BE REPRESENTATIVES THAT

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:11.039
