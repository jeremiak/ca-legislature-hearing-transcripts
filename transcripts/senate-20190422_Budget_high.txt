ME GOBBLING DOWN OUT WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL COLLEAGUES JOIN BUT SINCE IT'S AN INFORMATION HEARING. I'M GOING TO GET STARTED BECAUSE WE HAVE A FULL AGENDA I KNOW WE HAVE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE TODAY -- AND I INTEND. TO KEEP THE TRAINS MOVING IN THIS MORNING. MY SON SAYS WHEN I NANCY LIKE THAT HE KNOWS I'M VERY SERIOUS. SO I HOPE EVERYONE ELSE. UNDERSTANDS THAT AS WELL AND TEARS TO KEEP THE TRAINS MOVING -- GOOD MORNING AGAIN THANK YOU FOR JOINING US LET ME START BY SAYING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO JAMES. THE BIRTHDAY CHANGE. THIS HEARING COLLEAGUES WILL COVER AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT. A CRITICAL ONE TO ALL OF US ACROSS THE STATE. AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ME IT'S THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE YOU RECEIVE CALLS ABOUT IN YOUR DISTRICT OFFICE AND THAT'S THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. THE DMV IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY CONNECTION POINT BETWEEN RESIDENTS OF THIS STATE. AND THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT. OVER THE LAST YEAR A SERIES OF ROLLING CRISES HAVE IMPACTED THE DEPARTMENT AND DAMAGE THE PUBLIC'S TRUST. WAIT TIMES IN DMV FIELD OFFICES ROLES TO UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS VOTER REGISTRATION DATA WAS MISHANDLED AND QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT WHETHER THE STATE WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL REAL ID ACT. WHICH WILL HEAR ABOUT MORE IN A MINUTE. THESE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ARE SMEAR SYMPTOMS OF A LARGER SYSTEMIC. ISSUE. A NUMBER OF AUDITS IN PROGRAM REVIEW START. NEXT REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS IN THE GOVERNOR'S DMB STRIKE TEAM LED BY SECRETARY BADGER WILL DISCUSS THE FINDINGS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE REVIEWS OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND LASTLY THE DEPARTMENT WILL PRESENT DIFFERENT POLLS THE PROPOSED RESPONSE TO THESE ISSUES IN THEIR BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT ARE INDEED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. AFTER WE CONCLUDE OUR PANEL DISCUSSES WILL OPEN THE FOR FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. LET ME CLEAR. FIVE AND ASK MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE AGENDA AND THE PANELS AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN SEPARATED. BECAUSE I'M GOING TO ASK THAT YOU POSE YOUR QUESTIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE PANEL SOMETIMES WHEN WE START WITH THE LA L. AND THEY START WITH A HIGH LEVEL WE FOCUS ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS -- ON THE FIRST PRESENTER AND I THINK THAT'S NOT THE BEST USE OF OUR TIME TODAY. AGAIN -- LET'S BE CLEAR THAT -- CHAIR EXCEPT TO SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE HAS THE SUBCOMMITTEE. RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DMV AND THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS TO DELVE MORE DEEPLY INTO THE PARTICULARS OF THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED -- IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND AGAIN COLLEAGUES THIS ISN'T OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN THIS CONVERSATION -- HELP OR GET CLEARLY FROM ANY STATE DEPARTMENT DON'T JUST HAVE TO GET IT ALL IN A BUDGET HEARING YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REACH OUT TO LEADERSHIP. IN THE ADMINISTRATION THE DEPARTMENTS IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WITH THAT. I WILL INVITE -- MISLI PRINCIPLE FISCAL POLICY ANALYST AT THE LEGEND ONCE OFFICE TO COME FORWARD. BEFORE YOU GET STARTED MOSTLY SO THAT IT WILL MEMBERS JOIN US. HOME I WANT TO JUST REITERATE THE COLLEAGUES I ASK THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE GENDA -- AND SO YOU'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHO WILL BE PRESENTING A WHT PANELS AND SO YOUR QUESTIONS CAN BE DIRECTED TO THE APPROPRIATE PANEL. I'M ALSO GOING TO USE -- THE DISCRETION OF THE CHAIR -- BECAUSE WE HAVE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE TODAY AND I'M GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT NOON AND SO I'VE SAID EARLIER BEFORE YOU ALL JOIN THIS THAT I INTEND TO KEEP THE TRAINS ON TIME. TODAY EXCELLENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING ANY DAILY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING US TO PRESENT BEFORE YOU -- STAFF FASTEST TO PRESENT ON THIS FIRST PANEL SOME BACKGROUND TO SET THE FOUNDATION FOR YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY. THE SERGEANTS WILL HAVE DISTRIBUTED A HANDOUT THAT OUR OFFICES PREPARED IN THIS FIRST PANEL WILL BE COVERING PAGES ONE THROUGH FIVE OF THE HAND OUT. AND THEN THE REMAINDER OF THE HANDLE WILL BE COVERING WHEN WE COME BACK TO YOU AS PART OF PANEL THREE THANK YOU. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE FIRST WANT TO START WITH A REALLY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF REALIZE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND THE IMPACT ON DIEM THE OPERATIONS. THE FEDERAL REAL ID ACT -- FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE REQUIRED THAT STATE ISSUED DRIVER'S LICENSES AND IDENTIFICATION CARDS. MEETS THE MINIMUM IDENTITY VERIFICATION AND SECURITY STANDARDS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE USED FOR OFFICIAL PURPOSES THE KEY DATE THAT WE WANT TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD IS OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE THIS IS THE DATE BY WHICH IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLIANT LICENSE. A CARD YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF ID TO BOARD A DOMESTIC AIRPLANE. SO -- CALIFORNIA BE AN ISSUE A REAL ID'S AT THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR JANUARY OF LAST YEAR AND THROUGH THE END OF THIS FEBRUARY HAD ISSUED ABOUT THREE POINT ONE MILLION REAL ID'S. AND GETTING A REAL ID REQUIRES THAT INDIVIDUALS COME INTO THE FIELD OFFICE AND PROVIDE -- CERTAIN DOCUMENTS TO BE VERIFIED AND KIND OF DOCUMENTED SO THIS REALLY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN DIEM THE WORKLOAD IN TWO WAYS. FIRST THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO PROCESS DRIVERS LICENSES AND ID CARDS CROW. TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND ON TOP OF THAT YOU ALSO HAD PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE WOULD STATE OUT OF THE FIELD OFFICE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD RENEW BY MAIL OR WHO HAVE CARDS LICENSES THAT EXPIRE AFTER THE OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY DATE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND OUT. THE STATE DID PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO HELP WITH THIS WORKLOAD BUT DESPITE THOSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. ON THE WAIT TIMES BEGAN TO INCREASE AND THEY REALLY HAD IF HE CAN KIND OF THE SUMMER WHEN SOME INDIVIDUALS WERE WAITING A FEW HOURS. AND THE LAW THE DMV RESPONDED BY REQUESTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WHICH WILL GET TO SHORTLY -- HIRING TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES SHIFTING RECORD ON THE FIELD OFFICES SUCH AS LIKE USING SELF SERVICE TERMINALS ETCETERA. AND TO DATE THE WAIT TIMES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT DOWN TO UNDER AN HOUR. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT THIS PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO DATE. SO THE BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE WORKLOAD THE STATE PROVIDED. MONEY IN BOTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SPECIFICALLY TWENTY THREE MILLION FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. TO SUPPORT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN POSITIONS IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND FORTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION TO SUPPORT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POSITIONS IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ADDITIONALLY THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET INCLUDED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING PROVIDED TO DMV. UPON THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WE RECEIVED THREE LETTERS TO DATE -- UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE. THE FIRST WAS REQUESTED AN APPROVED IN AUGUST IT WAS FOR SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TO REDUCE WAIT TIMES AND SUPPORT -- ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY POSITION. IN TOTAL THAT BROADER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDING LEVELS TO SIXTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY POSITIONS. AND WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION PRESENTED ITS JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WAS THAT PLACE HOLDER NUMBER THAT YOU SAW. THERE ARE TWO OTHER REQUESTS AS YOU AS YOU SEE LISTED BEFORE YOU. ON THE LEGISLATURE HAS BASICALLY THROUGH THE END OF APRIL TO EVALUATE THEM -- ONE IS FOUR FORTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY POSITIONS AND TO MAINTAIN ALL ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED SO FAR. IN ORDER TO KEEP WAIT TIMES DOWN. THE SECOND REQUEST TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE IS FOR SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND THESE REALLY PERTAIN TO ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ALSO KIND OF PRESENTED IN YOUR APRIL FINANCE LETTER. TO THE BIG EXAMPLE IS THAT FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION OF THE SIX MILLION IS TO HIRE AND TRAIN THREE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES pREQUESTED AS PART OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET PROPOSAL. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT. WE'VE JUST PROVIDE A VERY HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET PROPOSAL YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT THEM IN MORE DETAIL. AS PART OF YOUR SITE I BELIEVE YOUR THIRD PANEL BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL. THE EVIL FINANCE LETTER REQUESTS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT TO SUPPORT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE PERMANENT POSITIONS. ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED TEMPORARY POSITIONS AND A WIDE RANGE OF OTHER ACTIVITIES SUCH AS CONSULTANTS -- FOR ASSESSMENTS AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING KIND OF LIVE CHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE -- OPPORTUNITIES. IT IS A MULTI YEAR REQUEST IT'S NOT JUST FOR FOR FOR ONE YEAR IT X. IT DOES RATCHET DOWN BUT IT EXTENDS INTO THE FUTURE. AND FINALLY THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES A SIMILAR PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO AUGMENT THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET UPON THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION TO JAIL BC. TURNING TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE. A NUMBER OF THE VALUATIONS THAT ARE ONGOING IMPENDING AND THE COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO WILL GENERALLY BE HEARING ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS -- THAT ARE KIND OF ROLLING OUT ESSENTIALLY OVER THE SUMMER INTO THE FALL. THE FIRST ONE IS THE DMV PERFORMANCE AUDIT THAT WAS JUST RECENTLY COMPLETED -- YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM THEM IN YOUR NEXT PANEL BUT THEY DID RAISE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE UNDERLYING ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SECOND IS THE DMV REINVENTION TEAM STRIKE FORCE TEAM THAT STARTED ITS WORK IN JANUARY AND CONTINUES ITS WORK TODAY YOU'LL AGAIN HERE FROM NOW ON YOUR SECOND PANEL. THE THIRD -- ONE WAS RECENTLY STARTED IN MARCH IT WAS A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND MCKINSEY AND COMPANY -- IN THIS ENGAGEMENT IS FOR ABOUT FIVE TO EIGHT MONTHS AND CAN BE WILL BE TASKED WITH KIND OF EVALUATING -- STAFF TRAINING ON REAL ID HOW REAL ID PROCESS SEES -- OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD OFFICES AS WELL AS HOW STAFF ARE TRAINED AND THESE ARE EXPECTED TO CAST KIND OF PROTOTYPE -- SUGGESTIONS OF RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WILL THEN BE USED TO INFORM FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL BE PRESENTED FOR KIND OF CONSIDERATION. THE FINAL ASPECT IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES TO CREATE A NEW OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. TASK OF THIS NEW OFFICE IS REALLY TO DEVELOP -- REQUIREMENTS FOR STATE DEPARTMENTS TO REASSESS HOW THEY PROVIDE SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS TO RE ENGINEER BUSINESS PROCESS SEES -- TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TO LEVERAGE DIGITAL INNOVATION AND TOOLS WHERE APPROPRIATE. AND SO -- THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT DMB WOULD LIKELY BE ONE OF THE OFFICES FIRST CLIENTS ESSENTIALLY. THE WITHOUT WORK AND OUR COMMENTS ON BACKGROUND AS A MENTION PREVIOUSLY WHEN I START THE COMMENTS THE REMAINDER OF THE HANDOUT WILL COVER -- AS PART OF YOUR THIRD PANEL. EXCELLENT THANK YOU MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF MISLEAD BASED ON THE PRESENTATION SHE HAS JUST GIVEN US. SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST A QUICK QUESTION ON PAGE THREE OF THE FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION TO HIRE AND TRAIN THREE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL TEMPORARY POSITIONS. WHEN YOU SAY TEMPORARY WHAT IS THAT TIME FRAME? WOULD THEY BE THERE FOR SIX MONTHS A YEAR A MONTH. THAT'S GOING TO BE A BETTER QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES WE HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON A CIVIL SERVICE RESTRICTIONS IN TERMS OF THAT TIME FRAME FOR WHICH EMPLOYEES CAN BE HIRED. ON AND SO THEY'LL BE A BETTER QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF IN TERMS OF HOW THEY PLAN TO LEVERAGE THEIR RESOURCES. OKAY. I WILL ASK THAT WILL OUTSIDE OF THE ACTING DIRECTOR WILL BE THE FIRST QUESTION UP IN THE FOR THE THIRD PANEL THINKING MAN THAT'S MINE THANK YOU. QUESTION SENATOR STONE OF THE LA L. BASED ON WHAT SHE'S JUST PRESENT IT THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU -- I GOT HER A LITTLE BIT LATE. THE WHOLE PRESENTATION OF IT ARE YOU. IT IS A DMV FINDING A LOT OF CONFUSION -- WITH REGARD TO THE DOCUMENTATION THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE SAFE ID ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT AT ALL. THE DMV WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SPEAK MORE. ACCURATELY AND KIND OF A MORE UP TO DATE ON THAT I WILL SAY IN THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN TALKING TO THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS HEARING FROM THE VARIOUS EVALUATIONS SO THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED -- KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION A WHAT DOCUMENTS TO PROVIDE WHAT IS NEEDED IS SOMETHING THAT IS HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE. OKAY BECAUSE IT -- I'M HEARING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD BRING A PASSPORT OR A SOCIAL SECURITY CARD OR WHAT SUFFICES AND SO WITH THE DMV MIGHT BE BETTER ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION ASK MISS WEB TO ADDRESS THAT -- SHE JOINS THE PANEL WHICH IS THE THIRD PANEL THANK YOU RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. CENTER NIELSEN. AND READ OVER THE THE DOCUMENT I'VE GOT HERE LATE AS WELL. BUT LET ME JUST ASK YOU A GENERAL QUESTION [inaudible] THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE DMV ARE NOT NEW. I'M FAMILIAR WITH THEM FOR DECADES. NOW WOULD IT BE YOUR OPINION THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED THERE WILL BE PRESENTED HERE. THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH. OUR OUR THE ENDEMIC IN AND INSTITUTIONALIZED. WILL IT TAKE A LOT OF DOING. THAT ON WIND THAT SORT OF CORPORATE MENTALITY AND STRUCTURE WITHIN THAT DEPARTMENT THAT HAS BEEN SO PERVASIVE AND PERSISTENT. AND SO FRUSTRATING FOR THE CITIZEN FOR SO LONG. THERE IS CERTAINLY UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL ISSUES AND IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT EXPECTATIONS THEY HAVE FOR THE DMV THAT CAN INCLUDE -- HOW THE EXPECTS THE DMV TO PROVIDE SERVICES WHAT GOALS AND KIND OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT THEY HAVE IN MIND? ONE OF THE THINGS A LITTLE WITH THAT WE'LL GET TO WHEN WE PRESENT ON YOUR THIRD PANEL IS THAT WE DO THINK SOMETHING TE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER. IS THE ISSUE OF ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE SHORT TERM IMPACTS VERSUS THOSE THAT HAVE LONG TERM IMPACTS. IN BY THAT. THE STATE IS SEEKING TO MEET THIS OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE AND THEIR CERTAIN ACTIONS THAT WILLREALLY HELP. WILL REALLY HELP MEET THAT DEADLINE. FOR SOME OF THE LONGER TERM ACTIONS -- RATHER THAN KIND OF APPROACHING IT SORT OF IN A PIECEMEAL MANNER IT MAY MAKE MORE SENSE TO HAVE THE ENVY AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS COME TOGETHER AND REALLY THINK THROUGH. KIND OF A LONG TERM KIND OF STRATEGIC OR OPERATIONAL PLAN TO REALLY LAY OUT WHAT THE STEPS ARE. TO ADDRESSING SOME OF THE SYSTEMIC CHANGES -- THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT ARE FACED SOME OF THEM WE CAN POTENTIALLY BE VERY EXPENSIVE SO FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THAT THERE BEEN CONCERNS ABOUT IT CAPABILITIES UNDERLYING ID CAPABILITIES ETCETERA. WE KNOW FROM OTHER BUDGET DISCUSSIONS THAT IT -- PROJECTS ARE FAIRLY EXPENSIVE BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES DEPARTMENTAL RESOURCES AND SO THAT SOMETHING OFF TO KIND OF KEEP IN MIND AS THE DEPARTMENT IS. KIND OF THINKING THROUGH CHANGES YOU HAVE KIND OF A LIMITED FOR EXAMPLE EXECUTIVE STAFF OF THE DMV. AND SO THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT HOW MANY PROJECTS DO YOU WANT MOVING AT THE SAME TIME CITY THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT THE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONSIDER AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE BE VERY DIRECTORY AT THIS TIME. IN WHATEVER WE SUGGEST TO THIS YEAR TO DMV TELLING THEM WHAT WE EXPECT NOT TELLING. HIM THAT HAVING THEM TELL US WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO. TO GET TO THE CORE. PROBLEMS I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED AS WELL AS VERY -- IN DEPTH AND SUSTAINED MONITORING. OF THE AGENCY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THINK IS UNTIL FOR THE AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THAT ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE AS LEGISLATORS ARE INFORMED ABOUT. WHAT'S FEASIBLE AND WHAT TO DO WILL PULL THAT WE DO A BETTER JOB AS LEGISLATORS TO REALLY FIND THE MILLION TO STAND WHAT IT TAKES TO GO TO TO CREATE CULTURE SHIFT. AND TO AND TO FINANCE AND DESIGN COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT ARE CURRENT AND RELEVANT GOING FOR IT WE WE HAVE HOMEWORK IN THE MORNING TO DO OURSELVES. SENATOR PAN. CARE TO SURVIVE SHE FOLLOWS UP ON THE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS IN THE QUESTION AS WELL SO CAN YOU JUST MAKE YOU SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY AS TO WHAT YOU SEE. THE ELLIE OWES ROLE IN HELPING US -- ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES IN THE SENSE THAT. WE ARE FACING SO MANY Q. CRISIS BUT THIS IS PRIDE BUILT ON CHRONIC ISSUES THAT CUMULATED OVER TIME INCLUDING YOU KNOW AT OLD VERY OLD ANTIQUATED -- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. AND THE RECOGNIZING EVEN THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE LIMITED TERMS AND SO FORTH -- WHAT AND WHAT YOU WHAT YOU SEE IS -- LA OWES ROLE IN HELPING US THAT AYE GUIDING US IN TERMS OF BE ON THE MONITOR. OVER THE LONG TERM -- VERY SPANISH MARKS THAT -- WE THAT SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATORS HAVE EXPECTED THE DMV TO TRY TO HIT OUR WEATHER WE MADE INVESTMENTS AND HOW THEY TURNED OUT -- BECAUSE MAYBE IS NOW THREE OR FIVE YEARS LATER AND PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THREE OR FIVE YEARS AGO. SURE -- I THINK KIND OF HOW WE ENVISION OUR FIRST ROLE ACTUALLY -- BE PRESENTED TO YOU LATER ON AS PART OF TOWN FOR A WE THINK ARE KIND OF FIRST ROLE IS THIS IS THERE IS TRANSIT PRETTY SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHOICES THAT NEED TO BE MADE HERE. SO OUR ROLE AS WE SEE IT AS PART OF YOUR THIRD PANEL IS TO PROVIDE SOME THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF HOW TO THINK THROUGH. TO HOLD THE LEGISLATURE THINK THROUGH AN WAY THE KEY FACTOR. I THINK IT WAS FUNNY I APPRECIATE THE OPTIONS AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF YOUR HEALTH AND RATE RECOGNIZING THEIR SOME LIMITATIONS TO HOW MANY RESOURCES LA -- HAS IN TERMS OF HELPING MONITOR -- BEYOND JUST THE AGENCY ITSELF REPORTING TO US. OUR THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE MADE THE POLICY THAT THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE PASSED TODAY ACHIEVE THEIR AIMS. SEVERAL YEARS LATER SIGNED AND THAT THE SO IT'S GOING TO POLICY OPTIONS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE FOLLOW THROUGH. WELL ALSO IN LINE WITH THAT FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HIGHLIGHT AS AN ISSUE FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IS THAT WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT CLEAR OUT COMING PERFORMANCE GOALS. ARE NEEDED IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE YOU AIMING FOR WHAT DO YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH AND WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ACTUALLY CLEARLY LAYS OUT. HIS SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH STAFF AND MEMBERS TO KIND OF DEFINE WHAT THOSE GOALS ARE AND ONCE THOSE GOALS ARE DEFINED. THAT PROVIDES US WITH THE BENCHMARKS OF FOR EXAMPLE IF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY TO THEN ADVISE YOU ON AND YOU KNOW DO THAT ANALYSIS ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S BEING ACCOMPLISHED I MEAN THAT THAT'S AN EXAMPLE. I THINK IN OTHER AREAS -- YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT WHAT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT. THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED AND SO FOR EXAMPLE LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY RECEIVES THESE ANNUAL REPORTS ON WAIT TIMES. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN BOTH KIND OF SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM OPTIONS HE COULD INVOLVE DIFFERENT REPORTING LANGUAGE REGULAR REPORTING COMMITTEE MONTHLY QUARTERLY THERE'S NO KIND OF MAGICAL NUMBER. BUT IT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE LAYING OUT WHAT ACTIVITIES OR PROJECTS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING IMPLEMENTED WHAT'S NEXT UP IN THE QUEUE WHAT -- CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND THAT REALLY HELPS US -- YOU KNOW KEEP IT HELPS US INTO THE LEGISLATURE KEEP UP TO DATE ON WHAT'S OCCURRING AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ANYTHING THAT JUMPS OUT AS BEING. A FLAT. I THINK SEPARATELY FROM THAT AND YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT -- THE LITTLE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE INTERESTED IN A VALUE AND HAVING US ABOUT A PARTICULAR IDEAS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I MEAN THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE CAN PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WITH. THANK YOU -- WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE WAIT TIMES I HAVE ONE GENERAL QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE SECOND. AND I'LL COME BACK YOU CENTER STONE. CAN YOU GIVE US A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT STATES HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB OF COMPLYING WITH THE REAL ID. KIND OF ROLL OUT AND PLANNING TODAY. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NOT SPEND VERY MUCH TIME ON BUT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE SECRETARY OF THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY AS PART OF THEIR DMB REINVENTION TRACK TEAM ACTUALLY SPENT TIME. REACHING OUT TO COUNTERPARTS IN DOING THAT AND ALSO SO I THINK THEY'LL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO SPEAK PERFECT ALL RIGHT TO THIS TOWN. THAT WAS PART OF MY QUESTION MADAM CHAIR BUT AS A LOOK THROUGH THE REPORT. IT LOOKS AS THOUGH -- SINCE WE STARTED THE PHYSICIANS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE'VE. INCREASED THE POSITION BY ALMOST A THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED BY MY CALCULATIONS -- I WANTED TO FIND OUT IN OTHER STATES THAT THEY'VE BEEN USING -- TECHNOLOGY TO TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES NECESSARY FOR THE REAL ID BUT THE REAL IDEAS REALLY -- STIFLED OTHER OPERATIONS WITH THE DMV BECAUSE OF THE WORKLOAD SO -- AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS A DIGITAL WHILE PROGRAM THAT HE WANTS -- TO TO EMBRACE AND AND AND MOVE FORWARD. DOES THE LA -- DO ANY KIND OF ANALYSIS. TO SEE IF THERE IS TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS THAT WE CAN USE THAT CAN IT WILL ALWAYS SEEM TO THROW MONEY IN POSITIONS AT A PROBLEM. BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE THE MANPOWER IT'S NECESSARY IT'S THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS REALLY GOING TO STREAMLINED SERVICE AT THE DMV. SO HAVE YOU EVALUATED THE THE NEEDS OF THE DMV TECHNOLOGICALLY TO MAKE THEM ON MORE EFFICIENT. MAKE THEM RUN FASTER AND LESS EXPENSIVE. WE HAVE THERE'S AND THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF KIND OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS ARE OPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THESE -- BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED TO AS PART OF THE VALUATIONS I THINK THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT YOU'LL HAVE KIND OF CONSULTING COMPANIES THAT ARE REALLY DIVING IN FOR IN DEPTH TO DO THIS AND THIS IS LAST MINUTE -- I THINK FROM OUR VIEWPOINT WE HAVE ASSESSED TECHNOLOGY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WERE PART OF A BUDGET PROPOSAL SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES FIRST. WITH CONSIDERING THE SELF SERVICE TERMINALS WE DID EVALUATE THAT PROPOSAL AND AND KIND OF OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT. THERE ARE A WIDE RANGE OF THAT -- IDEAS BEING. OFFERED NOW I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS A REINVENTION TRACK TEAM ARE CONSIDERING YOU'VE GOT CONSULTANTS ETCETERA. AND SO I THINK PART OF THOSE EVALUATION WILL REALLY HELP INFORM THIS DISCUSSION AND KIND OF DETERMINE WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO FOCUS ITS ATTENTION. AND I WOULD I WOULD ALSO KIND OF KICK IT BACK TO THIS LARGER ISSUE OF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO KIND OF SPECIFIED HOW IT ENVISIONS DMV OPERATING AND OFFERING SERVICES WHAT DO YOU ENVISION. DMV LOOKING LIKE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. YOUR QUESTION I SEE IT AS A HIGH TECH AGENCY OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT WHERE PEOPLE CAN DO AS MUCH OF THEIR BUSINESS ONLINE. AND BY MAIL AND NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO GO IN AND WITH EFFICIENCY AND AND REDUCE COSTS WHEREVER POSSIBLE BY UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS AND REPORT TO THE PRESS ACCOUNTS. THANK YOU CENTER MORE LOT. MADAM CHAIR GOOD MORNING THE MORNING -- MISLI JUST THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL I COME FROM A COUNTY THAT FILED FOR CHAPTER NINE BANKRUPTCY SO -- WE WE PUT IN A LOT OF REFORM SOMEONE OF THOSE REFORMS WAS PROVIDING AN ANNUAL BUSINESS STAY FOR BUSINESS -- REPORT FOR YOUR PLAN FOR EACH DEPARTMENT. AND THAT REPORT WOULD INCLUDE YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO. HOW WE MEASURE IT? AND HOW WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE DOING IN THE NEXT YEAR AND AND THEN HOW DID WE MEET THE PRIOR YOUR SCHOOLS IMAGES JUST A IT'S A NICE. ROAD MAP FOR ANY SUPERVISOR LEGISLATOR TO PICK UP. AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS BEING APPEAR I HAVEN'T SEEN A BUSINESS PLAN I BASS FORM BUT I CAN I GET. CUTE SMILES BUT WITH THE DMV OF HAD A BUSINESS PLAN IS SAID WE ANTICIPATE. THE S. THIS AMOUNT OF INCREASE IN VOLUME. THEREFORE WE NEED THIS AMOUNT OF NEW EMPLOYEES WE NEED TO TRAIN AND BY THIS AMOUNT OF TIME. AND AND WE NEED TO INTEGRATE THAT WITH THE STATE'S BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AND AND AND DO WE HAVE THAT. FOR DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE. I FIFTY EIGHT I THINK DEPARTMENTS REACTS DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON WHAT INITIATIVES ARE COMING THEIR WAY WE'VE CERTAINLY AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS BEEN PRESENTED WITH DIFFERING LEVELS OF INFORMATION -- RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO THE DMB I THINK THAT -- WHEN YOUR SECOND PANEL PRESENTS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AUDIT IDENTIFIED WAS THAT THERE WERE SOME CHALLENGES IN PREPARING FOR REAL ID IMPLEMENTATION AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT? IT SO --MOVING FORWARD AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED NEXT WITH THE MV WHAT LEVEL OF RESOURCES TO PROVIDE WHAT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT TO INCLUDE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND -- VERY SIMILARLY AND ADDRESSING SENATOR CAN'T QUESTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIND OF CLEAR OUTCOME OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT'S ONE OF THE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE MENTIONED THAT AS BEING POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT. THINKING ABOUT APPROPRIATE REPORTING EXCITER A SO. IF I WERE TO ASK THE DMV I I'D LIKE TO KNOW YOUR METRICS FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS HOW MANY CARS DID YOU REGISTER EVERY YEAR. HOW MANY NEW CARS HOW MANY USED CARS? IS THAT ALL THAT DATA AVAILABLE TO SEE WHAT KIND OF TRENDS WE HAVE. DMV DOES COLLECT DATA AND IT AND THEY HAVE PROVIDED DATA -- THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AS WELL AS REPORTS THAT ARE REQUESTED THEM FROM SO FOR EXAMPLE I REFERENCED IN THE PRESENTS REPORTS ON MONTHLY WAIT TIMES -- SOMETIMES THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED BY THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE OR POLICY MAKING STAFF ARE INTERESTED IN. AND SO PART OF THESE DISCUSSIONS IS REALLY KIND OF RE. ALIGNING THE TO SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CLEARLY SPECIFIES THEIR EXPECTATIONS THAT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT THEN TO THINK AHEAD AND BEGIN COLLECTING THAT INFORMATION OR COLLECTING IN IN A WAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE DEFIANCE OF FOR EXAMPLE IN OTHER AREAS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. DEFINITIONS ABOUT BACKLOG DEFINITIONS ABOUT WAIT TIME THERE SOMETIMES DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF HOW HE WOULD GO OUT MEASURING THAT AND IF YOU DON'T CLEARLY SPECIFY IT YOU OFTENTIMES CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS THAT -- EITHER ARE CONFUSING OR CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SO THERE'S IMPORTANCE AND KIND OF LAYING THAT EXPECTATION OUT VERY CLEARLY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VENTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ELAINE THOSE EXPECTATIONS ON THE FRONT END AND SO. THEY CAN WE CAN COLLECTIVELY RAMP UP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH APPLES APPLES CONVERSATION GREAT THANK YOU. BOB THANK YOU MISLI WILL SEE YOU AGAIN SHORTLY WILL ASK THE SECOND PANEL TO JOIN US. COLLEAGUES THIS PANEL THE FOCUS WILL BE EVALUATION OF DMB ORGANIZATION OPERATIONAL ISSUES WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM JENNIFER WOULD OCCUR IN MARYLAND STANDING HORSE IN THE OFFICE O STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND WILL ALSO BE JOINED BY THE SECRETARY OF GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY MAYOR BILL BADGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN CALLING FOR AN ASSET FOR THIS PANEL WE FOCUS. ON BUT MADAM SECRETARY FOR IT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP IN THE FIRST POSTED THE LA ALSO IF YOU COULD INCORPORATE THOSE AT THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION -- THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THIS WOULD OCCUR IN THE STANDING HORSE FIRST. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR INVITING US TO THIS HEARING AND PROVIDING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A BRIEF SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT RESORT WHICH MY MOVING THE MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOU I'D APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. WE PLAN TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE OBJECTIVES METHODOLOGY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF OUR AUDIT. OUR AUDIT FOUND SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESSES IN BEES UNDERLYING GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IN ADDITION DIEM BE OPERATED IN A REACTIVE CULTURE AND NEEDS TO REFOCUS ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. WE PRESENT THESE INDEPENDENT AND OBJECTIVE RESULTS TO ASSIST DECISION MAKERS IN MOVING THE DMB FORWARD. IN SEPTEMBER INTO IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AT THE DIRECTION OF GOVERNOR BROWN FINANCE CONDUCTED AN AUDIT. AT THE DMV WITH TWO PRIMARY AUDIT OBJECTIVES THE FIRST ONE SS THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DMV'S OPERATIONS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. TO IMPROVE THEIR PRACTICES AND ENHANCE THE CUSTER SKIS ME ENHANCE THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. OUR OBJECTIVE NUMBER TO EVALUATE DMV'S IT SYSTEMS AND ITS IMPACT ON THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. WE INTERVIEWED OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EMPLOYEES RANGING FROM THE FORMER DIRECTOR TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE FIELD OFFICES WE CONDUCTED THIRTY UNANNOUNCED VISITS TO FIELD OFFICES IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHERE AUDITOR'S OBSERVED OPERATIONS AS WELL AS PROCESS TRANSACTIONS AS A CUSTOMER. WE ALSO CONDUCTED FIFTEEN PLANNED VISITS WERE AUDITOR'S HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE OPERATIONS AND AS WELL AS A TEN WEDNESDAY MORNING TRAINING MEETINGS. WE REVIEWED AND EVALUATED OVER THREE HUNDRED RESPONSES WE ARE ONLINE CONTACT FORM WHERE WE RECEIVED RESPONSES FROM BOTH EMPLOYEES AND CITIZENS -- AND NOW I WILL TURN OVER THE ODD -- OVER TO THE AUDIT MANAGER AT MARYLAND STANDING HORSE WHO WILL GIVE YOU A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FINDINGS AND SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU AND WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. AS JENNIFER DESCRIBED AND AS DESCRIBED IN OUR AUDIT REPORT DMV OPERATIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE IN DELIVERING SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. MANY OPPORTUNITIES EXIST FOR THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR PRACTICES AND ENHANCE THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. OUR AUDIT RESULTS ARE ORGANIZED INTO TWO SECTIONS TWO CHAPTERS ONE FOR EACH OF OUR AUDIT OBJECTIVES. FEATURE OUR FINDINGS IS ACCOMPANIED BY DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH ARE FOCUSED ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR DMV TO IMPROVE THEIR PRACTICES. AND ENHANCE OUR OPERATIONS AND THEIR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. AB I WILL NOW GO OVER IT SUMMARY OF OUR FINDINGS AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. OUR FIRST AUDIT OBJECTIVE ON TV OPERATIONS AND THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE RESULTED IN SEVEN FINDINGS AS FOLLOWS. THE FIRST FINDING IS THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES IN PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REAL ID PROGRAM. THESE INCLUDED IT IN CONSISTENT APPROACH FOR PLANNING FOR REAL ID AND THE DECADE LEADING UP UP TO IMPLEMENTATION. DELAYED PRIORITIZATION OF THE RELATED I. T. PROJECT. UNTIL. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO REDESIGN UP POLICIES FOR THE FREQUENCY THAT CUSTOMERS REQUIRED DMV SERVICES. TO ADDRESS THIS FINDING FOR BOTH REAL ID AND FUTURE SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS WE RECOMMEND WE RECOMMEND DMV ASSIGNED A DEDICATED TEAM TO MONITOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. THE TEAM SHOULD ALSO HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED ROLES IN LEADERSHIP WITH ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO MONITOR KEY MILESTONES. FOR SECOND FINDING. THE DMV OPERATES UNDER AN OUTDATED ORGANIZATIONAL AND REPORTING STRUCTURE. FOR EXAMPLE FIELD OFFICE GRADING WHICH DETERMINES THE SIZE AND RESOURCES NEEDED FOR FIELD OFFICES. WITH LAST ASSESSED STATEWIDE IN. NINETEEN NINETY FURTHERMORE REGIONAL OFFICE OVERSIGHT OR FIELD OFFICES IS INCONSISTENT. AND DMV'S INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURE TO THEIR FIELD OFFICES IS INEFFICIENT. IN PART BECAUSE FIELD OFFICE EMPLOYEES DO NOT HAVE A DMV EMAIL ADDRESS. FOR THIS FINDING WE RECOMMEND DMB CONDUCT A SYSTEM WIDE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR FIELD OFFICE CREATING. EVALUATE THE RATIO AND LEVEL OF SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE REGIONAL OFFICES. TV SHOULD ALSO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING EMAIL ADDRESSES FOR THEIR FIELD OFFICE EMPLOYEES. OUR THIRD FINDING IS THAT THE INTHE STAFFING AND BUDGETING APPROACH IS NOT FOCUSED ON MAXIMIZING THE FIELD OFFICE CAPACITY. ON AVERAGE WE OBSERVE 30% OF FIELD OFFICES AND WINDOWS CLOSED WHEN WE CONDUCTED OUR OBSERVATIONS. IN ADDITION LONG TERM RELIABLE DATA ON FIELD OFFICE ABSENTEEISM WAS NOT READILY AVAILABLE FOR US. ALSO DMV DOES NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE PROCESS TO ALLOCATE POSITIONS TO FEEL OFFICES AFTER THEIR PRUDENT. AFTER THEIR APPROVED THOSE POSITIONS THROUGH THE BUDGET ACT TO EFFECTIVELY HANDLE THEIR CUSTOMER DEMAND. TO ADDRESS THIS FINDING WE RECOMMEND THE DMV DESIGNED THEIR WEEKLY FIELD OFFICE EMPLOYEES SCHEDULES TO ENSURE. ALL OFFICE WINDOWS ARE OPEN THEREFORE SERVING CUSTOMERS DURING BUSINESS HOURS. TV SHOULD ALSO TRACK AND ANALYZE THEIR ABSENTEEISM DATA. AND ENHANCE THEIR PROGRESS FOR ALLOCATING POSITIONS TO FELD OFFICES. OUR FOURTH FINDING IS THAT TV IMPORT DMV'S APPOINTMENT PRACTICES NEED IMPROVEMENT. SPECIFICALLY THERE POINT SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR DIFFERENCES AND APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THE RESERVATION OF DUPLICATE APPOINTMENTS. WE RECOMMEND DV STRENGTH IN THE SYSTEM TO ENHANCE OUR CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO BOOK APPOINTMENTS TIMELY -- BUT WAYS TO ENHANCE THAT SYSTEM INCLUDE REQUIRING UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS WHEN CUSTOMERS RESERVE THEIR APPOINTMENTS ANDFIELD OFFICE EMPLOYES VERIFYING THE AUTHENTICITY OF APPOINTMENTS WHEN CUSTOMERS ARRIVE. OUR FIFTH FINDING IS THAT STATE WIDE MONITORING OF THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THESE IMPROVEMENTS. DMV IS INITIATIVE SUCH AS THE COMMAND CENTER AND LEAN SIX SIGMA TEAM OR UNTIMELY IMPLEMENTED WITH REGARD TO THE SUMMER TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAIT TIMES. AND THESE GROUPS HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. ALSO DMV'S INTERNAL AUDIT UNIT DOES NOT AUDIT CUSTOMER SERVICE RELATED TOPICS. FOR THIS FINDING WE RECOMMEND DMV REEVALUATE AND RE DIRECT THESE HEADQUARTERS RESOURCES TO BETTER MONITR AND RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. OUR SIX FINDING. IN RESPONSE TO THE SUMMER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAIT TIMES DMV IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER SERVICE ENHANCEMENTS. HOWEVER WE FOUND THAT FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOL SUCH AS TABLETS. TEXT NOTIFICATIONS WINE TRIAGE ING AND ACCURATELY TRACKING AN ADVERTISING WAIT TIMES WERE INCONSISTENTLY IMPLEMENTED. TO ADDRESS IS FINDING DMV FIELD OFFICES SHOULD CONSISTENTLY TRIAGE THEIR LINES USE TABLET DEVICES AN OFFER TEXT NOTIFICATIONS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. THE V. ALSO SHOULD ACCURATELY ADVERTISE WAIT TIMES ON THEIR WEBSITE SO THAT CUSTOMERS CAN BETTER PLAN FOR THEIR VISITS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND DMV EXPAND AND ADVERTISE ALTERNATIVES FOR OBTAINING SERVICES IN FIELD OFFICES. SUCH AS EXPANDING FUNCTIONS AND CAPABILITIES OF THEIR KIOSKS AND CALL CENTERS. OUR SEVENTH -- AND LAST FINDING FOR THE FIRST OBJECTIVE. IS THAT FIELD OFFICE MPLOYEE TRAINING AND RESOURCES ARE INADEQUATE. FOR EXAMPLE OVER 20% OF EMPLOYEES. FROM THE OFFICES THAT WE VISITED HAD. WE VISITED HAD ATTENDED NEITHER A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR VEHICLE REGISTRATION TRADING. ANY OF THESE EMPLOYEES WERE NEW HIRES. TV SHOULD TIMELY PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING TO THEIR NEW HIRES. AND EXPLAIN EXPAND THEIR TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING EMPLOYEES BEYONDTHEIR WEEKLY ONE HOUR MEETINGS. OUR SECOND OBJECTIVE WAS ON IT IS IMPACT ON THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND WE HAD THREE FINDINGS FOR THAT OBJECTIVE. THE FIRST FINDING WAS THAT HAVE INSUFFICIENT NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND LACK OF NETWORK MONITORING CONTRIBUTED TO FIELD OFFICE OUTAGES. ALSO DMV'S PRIORITIZATION AND RESOLUTION OF I. T. ISSUES NEEDS IMPROVEMENT -- TV SHOULD ADDRESS ITS NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE MONITORING DEFICIENCIES AND ENHANCE ITS. RESPONSE PROCESS. OUR SECOND IT RELATED FINDING -- IS THAT THE REAL LIFE D. I. T. PROJECT DID NOT FOLLOW INDUSTRY STANDARDS WITH REGARD TO PRIORITIZATION. RESOLVING PROJECT DEFECTS TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION. WE RECOMMEND TV COMPLETE ALL REQUIRED TESTING AND RESOLVE ALL PROJECT DEFECTS BEFORE LAUNCHING A NEW I. T. PROJECTS. THEY SHOULD ADEQUATELY DOCUMENT KEY DECISIONS AND COMPONENTS OF THEIR I. T. PROJECTS. AND GOING FORWARD D. V. SHOULD ALSO REVISIT ITS PROJECT PRIORITIZATION PROCESS. TO MAKE SURE THAT HIGH IMPACT AND SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS ARE GIVEN ADEQUATE TIME AND RESOURCES FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. OUR THIRD AND FINAL FINDING IS THAT TV'S USE OF LEGACY COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR SUCCESSION PLANNING RISKS. TV NEEDS TO TRANSITION FROM THE LEGACY COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND WORK ON ADDRESSING THEIR SUCCESSION PLANNING RISKS THAT THESE CREATE. WITHOUT ADDRESSING OUR AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. DMV WILL CONTINUE FACING CHALLENGES AND EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY DELIVERING SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. DMV STATED THAT THEY AGREED WITH OUR FINDINGS AND THE RESPONSE TO OUR AUDIT REPORT. WE REQUESTED A DETAILED CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN FROM TV. DUE IN MAY. DESCRIBING THEIR PLANNED ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE FINDINGS AND CORRESPONDING RECOMMENDATIONS. A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN SHOULD DESCRIBE MILESTONES AND TIME LINES TO ADDRESS EACH FINDING. OUR PLAN IS TO MONITOR THEIR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN PROGRESS. ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS TODAY WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND COLLEAGUES I THINK BEFORE SECRETARY BAGS BEFORE WE HAVE YOU START --BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA TRANSITION A BIT TO STRIKE TEAM WORK IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS MEMBERS HAVE. COME ON THE AUDIT. OF THE FIRST TWO WITNESSES. QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THIRTY STONE FAQ -- MADAM CHAIR I I KIND OF FEEL LIKE THIS IS A CONFESSION -- EPISODE HERE. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR HONESTY AND DESCRIPTION OF OF OF THE ISSUES -- I FIND IT. RATHER ALARMING WHEN YOU MENTION THAT ONE THIRD OF THE SLOTS -- WERE WERE OPE WHEN CUSTOMERS WERE COMING AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I THINK -- HAS AS GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES SOMETIMES WE FORGET WHO ARE BOSSES ARE -- ELECTED OFFICIALS CONSTANTLY REMINDED WHO ARE BOSSES ARE NOT THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT WE WE SERVE. AND SO -- WHAT OF WHAT WILL THOSE PEOPLE DOING A ONE THIRD OF THE SLOT SIR ARE DOWN I MEAN-IT WE? WE'VE ADDED -- BUDGET REQUESTS. TO ADD UPWARDS OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE INTO -- VARIOUS DMV OFFICES AND WHAT IS PEOPLE DOING. SO FROM THE OFFICE AS WE VISITED WE LEARNED THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THAT ONE THIRD 30% OF WINDOW CLOSURES -- ONE OF THEM WAS DUTY BREAKS AND LUNCH PERIOD SO WHEN A PERSON GOES ON BREAK OR GOES ON LUNCH THERE ISN'T ANOTHER PERSON. OF FOR THE ONES THAT WE VISITED TO FILL THAT WINDOW AND CONTINUE HELPING CUSTOMERS. ANOTHER REASON IS FOLKS -- CALLING IN SICK OR ABSENT FROM THE OFFICE THAT DAY -- AND THEN THE THIRD REASON WOULD BE THAT NOT. EVERY POSITION IN THAT FIELD OFFICE HAS BEEN TRAINED TO WORK THAT WINDOW TO HELP DRIVERS LICENSE OR REGISTRATION. BUT YOU MENTIONED TRAINING -- YOU MENTIONED THAT A LOT OF THE EMPLOYEES OR WHATEVER YOU AND TRYING TO PROCESS A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR REGISTRATION. I FIND THAT. PASTORS ARE WITH THEIR DMV EMPLOYEES AS ONE OF THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF EMPLOYEES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES HOW CAN WE HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THAT. WE PUT PEOPLE AT A WINDOW IN THAT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROCESS THESE. BASIC -- SERVICES -- SAYS YOUR QUESTION HOW I'M SORRY WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION. I GATHER THIS IS AUDITS AND IF. THEY CAN ANSWER. IN HALF AND THEN THE THE MAYBE IT'S MORE RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT THE AND THEN THE REAL ID AT% THE THE REAL ID PROCESS STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND WE HAD LIKE FIFTEEN YEARS TO PREPARE FOR IT. WHAT SOUNDS LIKE IN THAT FIFTEEN YEAR PERIOD WE DIDN'T DO A WHOLE LOT TO PREPARE FOR IT SOUNDS LIKE WE GOT? HIT WITH THE STORM OF REQUESTS AND NOT EVEN UNDER. STANDING THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE PROCESSES TO TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THESE PEOPLE AND IN AS A PART OF THE AUDIT DID YOU FIND THAT IN SOME CASES THAT WE WERE. PROCESSING REAL ID'S WITHOUT THE CORRECT INFORMATION IS A MAN IS A TRUE THAT. A PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT WERE. THAT THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING REAL ID IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RETURN TO THE DMV BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS REQUIRED. FOR THAT ANSWER -- DEFERRED TO THE DMV PANEL EITHER PANEL THREE OR SECRETARY BACHELOR. OF OUR AUDIT DID NOT INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF THE STATE'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL RADIO REALLY T. OCT. OKAY -- THANK YOU MANAGER I'M I'M JUST. I WILL OFFER ADVICE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS -- DMV AND THE SECRETARY THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR I'M JUST CURIOUS. MISS SAYS STANDING ORDERS A IN A IN A ALL THOSE THAT YOU INTERVIEWED DID YOU ALSO INTERVIEW REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AUTO CLUB -- NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO. OKAY BECAUSE I ARE WAS THINK I'M GONNA GO TO TRIPLE A NOT THE DMV. WHY WERE THEY EXCLUDED -- OUR EFFORTS FOCUSED ON THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WITH REGARD TO BUSINESS PARTNERS SUCH AS TRIPLE A AUTO CLUBS. WE DID LOOK AT WHAT TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE CAPABLE OF HANDLING AND I BELIEVE IN OUR REPRT WE RECOMMEND DV EXPLORING. EXPANDING THOSE OPTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER. OKAY THIRTY NIELSEN. YEAH THIS IS A THE I. T. IS A VERY BIG ISSUE. WE'VE SPENT BILLIONS IN. SQUANDERED BILLIONS. YOU NAME THE AGENCY I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A ONE THAT'S EVER WORKED. HE MENTIONED THAT. THEY DID NOT FOLLOW QUOTE INDUSTRY STANDARDS. AND DOES A EMBARKED ON NEW I. T. THEN. WHAT DID THEY DO WHAT WAS THEIR GUIDES? IN LIEU OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS DID THEY JUST INVENT THEIR OWN OR DID THEY JUST NOT. EMPLOYEE STANDARDS. SO DO WE HAVE A SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE WHICH WOULD BUT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED AS THEIR STANDARD. FOR IT PROJECTS AND THE DESIGN OF THAT PROCESS DOES FOLLOW INDUSTRY STANDARDS HOWEVER WITH THE REAL ID PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY HAD A SHORTENED TIME FRAMES. THEY HAD -- TO FIVE PASSED CERTAIN PARTS OF THAT PLAN OF THAT CYCLE. SO AS I MENTIONED SOME OF THE TESTING OF THE SYSTEM -- RESOLVING DEFECTS OF THE SYSTEM THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THEY CUT OUT OF THEIR CYCLE. THE DAY NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED THIS EVENTUALITY THOUGH AND BUILT IN SOME PROCEDURES TO ACCOMMODATE IT. TO RESPOND MORE QUICKLY WHEN THEY SAW THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING. ACCORDING [inaudible] TO EDGELL -- ISN'T THAT A NORMAL WAY OF BUSINESS. MANAGES IT'S TIME LINES AND AND BENCHMARKS. YES I WOULD AGREE AND AS WE SAY IN OUR REPORT BECAUSE THE REAL I. T. I. T. PROJECT WAS NOT MADE A PRIORITY UNTIL. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEY HAD A LIMITED TIME FRAME AND NOT -- THESE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MADE IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN ROLL OUT DATE YOU DID MENTION THAT -- THEY DIDN'T NOT NOT NOT MAKE THAT A PRIORITY SO. THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT AND I WOULD JUST LASTLY SUGGEST AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT. THE CRY OF AGENCIES WHEN THEY HAVE TROUBLES. BACK LOG SERVICE. ALL KINDS THEY COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND SAY WE NEED MORE MONEY. WELL I AM FINDING THAT. NOT COMPELLING. IN FACT ALMOST OFFENSIVE. COME AND TELL US WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH MONEY. AND HOW IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WITH THE PLAN. BUT DON'T JUST COME AND SAY MORE MONEY AND I SAW A MESSAGE TO ALL AGES. IN THE SAME YEAR WITH DMV IF THERE ANSWER IS MORE MONEY -- I'M GOING TO BE DEAF TO THEIR PLEASE [inaudible] MISTER JONES. I'M SURE IN YOUR ANALYSIS -- DID YOU COMPARE ORG HONESTLY COMPARE -- AND DID YOU LOOK AT WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING -- IN THERE DMV DEPARTMENTS -- EITHER. YOU KNOW OVERALL OR INTO SPECIFIC ISSUES. THE SPECIFIC -- FINDING AN ISSUE WHERE WE LOOKED AT OTHER STATES WAS WITH ALTERNATIVE SERVICE OPTIONS -- SO FOR EXAMPLE THE KIOSK THAT TV HAS WE LOOKED AT WHAT OTHER STATES TRANSACTION CAPABILITIES AND VOLUME OF THEIR KIOSKS ARE -- WE ALSO LOOKED AT HOW OTHER STATES. GET FOLKS OUT OF THE FIELD OFFICE -- OTHER STATES WILL ACCEPT. A VISION CERTIFICATION FROM THEIR OPTOMETRIST SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A VISION TEST IN THE IN THE OFFICE SO WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THAT. IS THERE A WERE YOU ABLE TO RANK THE STATE'S ON YOU KNOW WHO'S DOING THE BEST JOB IN WHO'S DOING THE WORST JOB IN. IS THERE A GOLD STANDARD OUT THERE THE FIFTY STATES IS THERE A GOLD STANDARD OF OF A STATE THAT WE CAN ASPIRE TO MATCH OR BEAT. WE DID NOT -- PERFORM THAT ANALYSIS. PERHAPS THE DMV HAS THAT INFORMATION AND COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION ON THE REAL ID ISSUE SPECIFICALLY ALL FIFTY STATES HAVE TO DO THIS. SO -- AGAIN AS OUR STATE OUT THERE THAT'S WAY AHEAD OF EVERYBODY ELSE. FOR THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION I WOULD DEFER TO THE STRIKE TEAM. NINETY THANK YOU [inaudible] PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND APPRECIATE -- YOU LOOKING AT THIS I THINK IT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION MAYBE IN WRONG. A THERE SEEMS TO BE PARTICULAR FOCUS AND CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AT THAT ARE FACE TO FACE INTERACTION AND I KNOW YOU DID LOOK A LITTLE BIT ONLINE BUT I GUESS IN TERMS OF AND AND YOU MADE MENTION JUST MADE MENTION THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY. HANDLE THINGS OUTSIDE THE OFFICE BUT THIS IS THERE ARE GONNA BE MORE APPROACH OF LOOKING AT MY SAY THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IT'S ACTUALLY NOT JUST. INTERFACING WITH AN OFFICE OR EVEN A KIOSK BUT JUST OVERALL BECAUSE OF THE DISEASE MENTIONED WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING. TO DECREASE IN FACT THAT'S KIND OF THE EXPECTATION NOW RIGHT AND EVEN A KIOSK SEEMS A LITTLE OLD FASHIONED BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE. IN MOST OF THE SITE. WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING A BILL LATER ON TODAY ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING FOOD DELIVERED USING TO CAO FRESH BENEFITS AND WHAT KIND OF GUIDELINES YOU HAVE THAT IN OTHER WORDS. WE ORDERED THINGS -- AND WE HAVEN'T DELIVER TO OUR DOOR. SO THAT'S KIND OF THE NEW EXPECTATION IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE EVERYTHING WITH YOUR COMPUTER OR YOUR I. PHONE AND THEN WHATEVER YOU NEED GETS MAILED TO YOU. IT'S A LOCATION THAT YOU DESIGNATE I REALIZE WE DO HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ADDRESSES AND FIGURE THAT OUT BUT I I THINK IN TERMS OF TRYING TO LOOK MORE BROADLY -- BUT WE LOOKING AT THAT KIND OF DEVICE THAT THE TOTAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE FROM THE TIME THEY NEED TO ENCOUNTER DMV TO AND HOPEFULLY THEY NEVER EXCEED EVER NEED TO TOUCH IN OFFICE IS THAT SOMETHING THE THAT WAS LOOKED AT BY -- THIS AUDIT. I THINK THAT BEYOND THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THAT MAYBE SOMETHING THE STRIKE TEAM OR DMV COULD SPEAK TOWARDS -- I WILL SAY THAT THE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON THE FIELD OFFICE WAS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT TO GET A REAL ID YOU HAVE TO GO TO A FIELD OFFICE YOU CAN'T DO THROUGH ANOTHER SERVICE CHANNEL BUT THE LAST TIME FOCUSED ON REAL IDEA AND SO THAT WAS. ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS OF US FOCUSING ON FIELD OFFICES AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF I. T. RECOGNIZING WE HAVE A LEGACY SYSTEM I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE TO STILL USING KOBOL. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE EVEN RECOGNIZE WAT KOBOL IS ANYMORE -- THE OF WE ALSO RECOGNIZE ALSO TAKES TIME TO DEVELOP IT SYSTEMS ARE WE LOOKING AT I'D SAY IT'S SOME OFF THE SHELF TYPE OF APPROACHES AS WELL BECAUSE WE MAY NOT HAVE TIME GIVE THE DEADLINES OF THE REAL ID TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A BRAND NEW. COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND EVEN THOUGH WE'VE INVESTED SOME BEFORE I'M NOT SURE OF WHERE WE ARE N THAT TIME LINE TO BE SURE IT'S ACTUALLY UP AND RUNNING FAST ENOUGH. WE CAN BE UP AND RUNNING BY THE DEADLINE THAT'S TOO LATE IT HAS TO BE UP AND RUNNING RIGHT NOW. SO WHERE ARE WE WITH THE I. T. -- INFRASTRUCTURE WE OOKING AT IF WE'RE NOT THERE READY WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT OFF THE SHELF SOLUTIONS. I WOULD JUST -- I WOULD DEFER TO DMB FOR THAT ANSWER OF HELL DAVE PLAN TO TRANSITION FROM THOSE LEGACY LANGUAGES. HOWEVER WE DID HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACING THEIR I. T. OPERATION THEIR I. T. PORTFOLIO AND THEIR I. T. WARN YOU ASK YOU THAT FROM OUT ITS PERSPECTIVE -- IS THE I. T. SYSTEM RIGHT NOW SUFFICIENT TO HANDLE THE PROBLEM -- AS WE POINT OUT OUR AUDIT THEY HAVE A DMV HAS EXPERIENCED. MULTIPLE OUTAGES INCIDENTS AND THAT SOUNDS LIKE NO. THEY HAVE A HIGH A HIGH RISK IT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL OKAY. IF YOU COULD CLARIFY FOR ME BECAUSE I I'M HERE IN A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES I THINK ASKING YOU QUESTIONS REALLY KIND OF BEYOND THE SCOPE OF AN AUDIT THAT IN AN AUDIT YOU DON'T DO THESE KINDS OF COMPARISONS TO OTHER STATES IT'S IT'S NOT. THAT'S NOT WHAT AN ODDITY ITSELF FROM AN AUDIT AND EVALUATION PERSPECTIVE -- WHAT COMES NEXT YOU'VE DONE THE AUDIT -- IS THERE ANY EXPECTATION -- THAT THE AGENCY OR THE DEPARTMENT -- COME BACK TO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP IN TERMS OF KIND OF TICKING OFF THEY'VE HANDLED THIS RECOMMENDATION. IT'S IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD FROM WHICH I COME WHEN WE GOT TO GET NOT IT THERE IS A FOLLOW UP MEETING WITH YOUR AUDITOR SO. THEY CAN COME BACK EXT YEAR AND SAY THESE COURSE CORRECTIONS WERE MADE IS THAT THE NATURE OF AS A STE. FROM FINANCE AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT WHEN YOU DO AUDITS AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS IS THERE THAT KIND OF FOLLOW UP. YES -- SO FOR WITH DMV AND WITH MANY OF OUR AUDITS ARE STANDARD PROCESSES SIXTY DAYS AFTER OUR FINAL REPORT WE REQUEST THAT DETAILED CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. AND THEN -- SIX MONTHS AFTER THAT PLAN WE ASK FOR UPDATES ON HOW EACH OF THEIR PLANNED ITEMS. ARE MATERIALIZING HAVE THEY MET THEIR MILESTONES WHAT ACTIVITIES AND ACTIONS HAVE THEY TAKEN AND THAT CONTINUES EVERY SIX MONTHS -- UNTIL ALL THE FINDINGS ARE RESOLVED OR UNTIL THREE YEARS HAS ELAPSED OCCASIONALLY WE WILL DO SUBSEQUENT MORE IN DEPTH -- REVIEW OF THEIR REPORTED ACTIONS. IS THERE A PROCESS OR AN OPPORTUNITY IN THAT PROCESS WERE DEPARTMENT CAN PUSH BACK IN EITHER CHALLENGE YOUR FINDINGS ARE CHALLENGE YOUR RECOMMENDATION -- DURING OUR REPORTING PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO OUR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS EVEN BEFORE THE REPORT DURING OUR EXIT CONFERENCES AND UPDATE MEETINGS THEY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY -- IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. IT'S TO THE DEPARTMENT'S DISCRETION TO IMPLEMENT HOW WE HAVE WARDED OUR RECOMMENDATIONS -- BUT WE WILL FOLLOW UP AND ASK THEM BUT IT'S FIFTY THAT EXIT CONFERENCE PROCESS AT THAT CAN KIND OF BE DISCUSSED YES THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS AROUND AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SECRETARY Q. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US SECRETARY BADGER. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AS YOU KNOW IN EARLY JANUARY GOVERNOR NEWSOME APPOINTED ME TO LEAD A THE STRIKE TEAM. THE GOAL OF WHICH WAS TO REINVENT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. THE STRIKE TEAM WAS GIVEN SIX MONTHS BUT WE KNOW THAT THESE ISSUES. ARE THE ISSUES THAT THE DMB RUN DEEP. AND IT WILL TAKE MUCH LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE STRIKE TEAM IS DOING THAT I BELIEVE WILL pHAVE LONG TERM IMPACT FOR THE DMV AND ITS CUSTOMERS. FIRST HOWEVER LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THE MISSION OF THE STRIKE TEAM. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO BEGIN WORK OF REINVENTING THIS PUBLIC FACING STATE AGENCY WE ARE NOT SIMPLY TALKING TO PEOPLE AND THEN WRITING A REPORT. WE'RE RE ENGINEERING PROCESSES WE A RE PRIORITIZING SERVICES TO GET TRANSACTIONS THAT CAN BE DONE ONLINE OR AT A KIOSK OUT SIDE OF THE FIELD OFFICES. SO THAT THE DMV TECHNICIANS AT PUBLIC COUNTERS CAN SPEND TIME ON THE MOST COMPLEX SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIA DRIVERS LIKE THE REAL ID'S WHICH REQUIRE AN IN PERSON VISIT. AND WHICH INDEED ARE CREATING AN UNPRECEDENTED VOLUME OF VISITS TO THE FIELD OFFICES. BUT FIRST LET ME ASSURE US SOME OF THE BASICS ONE OF THE PERENNIAL -- FRUSTRATIONS WITH DMB IS THAT YOU CAN'T USE A CREDIT CARD IN A FIELD OFFICE GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS NOTED THIS AND THAT MAKE THEM HAS SAID THAT IT MAKES NO SENSE IN THE MODERN ERA. THE STRIKE TEAM LOOKED AT PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO CREDIT CARD USE AT THE DMV INCLUDING SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUES. WE RELEASED AN INVITATION TO NEGOTIATE FOR BIDDERS AND BY THE END OF APRIL JUST A COUPLE WEEKS WE EXPECT TO AWARD A CONTRACT TO A CREDIT CARD VENDOR. IN MAY AND JUNE WILL WORK TO COMBINED THE DEBIT AND THE CREDIT CARD SERVICES AND BEGIN TO PILOT IN A FIELD OFFICE BY JULY. WITH A FULL IMPLEMENTATION EXPECTED BY THE END OF THE YEAR. WITH THE PRIORITY TO HAVE AS MANY TRANSACTIONS AS POSSIBLE DONE OUTSIDE OF THE FIELD OFFICE WE ARE EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF SELF SERVICE TERMINALS AND KIOSKS AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND ADDING OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES THAT THOSE KIOSKS CAN DO. THERE ARE CURRENTLY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO KEELE BOSQUES IN FIELD OFFICES AND RETAIL AND OTHER NON FIELD OFFICE LOCATIONS. WE RECOMMEND ADDING ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED SELF SERVICE TERMINALS IN KEY LOCATIONS BY THIS SUMMER AND ANOTHER BY THEEND OF THE YEAR. THE USAGE OF THESE KIOSKS HAS RISEN AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND TRANSACTIONS WERE PROCESSED ON THE KIOSKS AND EVER WORRY. COMPARED TO A HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND LAST SEPTEMBER. THE STRIKE TEAM HAS A PILOT PROJECT UNDER WAY TO BRING THE DMV TO MAJOR CALIFORNIA COMPANIES IN ORDER TO HELP THEIR EMPLOYEES GET A REAL ID. AT THEIR WORK PLACE RATHER THAN VISITING A DMV FIELD OFFICE. THIS POP UP DMV IS AIMED AT OUR STATES BUSINESS TRAVELERS WITH ADVANCE NOTICE AND COORDINATION WITH DMV. MAJOR EMPLOYERS WILL PREPARE MEMBERS OF THEIR WORK FORCE TO PULL TOGETHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS FOR REELED ID AND BRING THEM ON A DESIGNATED DAY AND COMPLETE THE ENTIRE APPLICATION PROCESS. AT THEIR WORK LOCATION WITHIN MINUTES WE HAVE THE FIRST PILOT SCHEDULED AT HEALTH NET HERE IN SACRAMENTO REGION THIS WEEK. IT IS IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL WE HOPE TO HAVE MANY MORE AT LARGE CORPORATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE DMV WEBSITE IS NOT INTUITIVE AND DOES NOT CLEARLY GUIDE THE USER TO NEEDED INFORMATION. THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDS AN IMMEDIATE OVERHAUL OF THIS WEBSITE USING THE BEST PRACTICES OF HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN. THIS WILL DELIVER A MODERN WEBSITE THAT PUTS CUSTOMERS FIRST. MAKES IT EASIER TO COMPLETE TRANSACTIONS AND REDUCES THE NUMBER OF FIELD OFFICE VISITS. WELL IF YOU CAN'T FIND WHAT YOU NEED -- ON THE WEBSITE THE NEXT STEP OFTEN IS FOR YOU TO PICK UP THE PHONE WELL THAT EXPERIENCE HAS ALSO BEEN FRUSTRATING FOR DMV CUSTOMERS THE STRIKE -- OPERATES ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST EFFICIENT CALL CENTERS IN THE STATE TO DO A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE DMV'S CALL CENTER PRACTICES. AND SHARE BEST PRACTICES. AMONG ITS FINDINGS WERE THAT DMB SHOULD DEVELOP AN ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE HIT HIRING AND TRAINING PLAN. GET MORE AGENTS ON TO THE PHONES OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE OBSERVED PHONE AGENTS. AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AGENTS WERE NOT ON THE PHONES BECAUSE THEY WERE DOING WHAT PERFORMING BASIC OFFICE DUTIES. RAY TO PERSONAL COMPUTERS SO THAT TECHNICIANS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO EMAIL AND ONLINE MANUALS CURRENTLY TECHNICIANS MUST RELY ON PAPER MANUALS WELL THEY'RE TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE ON THE TELEPHONE. HE CAN EVEN DO A WORD SEARCH OBVIOUSLY. ADDITIONALLY WE NEED TO EXPAND THE WEBSITE BY ADDING CHAT BOT IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER ON BY THE LA -- TO ANSWER BASIC QUESTIONS FOR USERS AND THEN MOVE TOWARDS LIVE CHAT WITH DMB SERVICE AGENTS AT THE CALL CENTERS. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT CUSTOMERS KNOW WHAT DOCUMENTS TO BRING WITH THEM TO THE FIELD OFFICES. OUR GOAL IS TO COMPLETE EVERY% REAL ID PROCESS IN ONE SINGLE VISIT. THAT MEANS WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE CLEARLY ABOUT WHAT EVERY PERSON NEEDS TO BRING WITH THEM SUCH AS WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A NAME CHANGE WHICH MAKES IT. A VERY COMPLICATED TRANSACTION. RIGHT NOW THE DMV. PROCESS IS AN AVERAGE OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND REAL ID'S PER MONTH THE DMV NEEDS TO DOUBLE THAT CAPACITY TO SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PER MONTH. IF THEY ARE TO PROCESS EVERYONE WHO IS EXPECTED TO COME IN THE DOOR BEFORE OCTOBER ONE TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE. FRANKLY THAT'S HUGE THESE NUMBERS ARE HISTORIC AND TRULY UNPRECEDENTED FOR THE DMV. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE MONTHLY FIGURE COULD BE EVEN LARGER BECAUSE WE ONLY GET 80% OF THE REAL ID TRANSACTIONS RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. 20% THERE FOR THE REAL ID CUSTOMERS HAVE TO COME BACK FOR A SECOND VISIT. SO THAT MEANS. TWENTY THREE MILLION MORE VISITS TO THE DMV AGAIN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WE ESTIMATE BY THE THE B. C. B. ESTIMATES ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION. FRANKLY THE STRIKE TEAMS AUBURN OBSERVATION IS ABOUT FIFTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION. PEOPLEWILL NEED TO HAVE A REAL ID BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER. ONE AND WITH A 20% RETURN RATE THAT'S ANOTHER THREE TO FOUR MILLION. DMV HAS CREATED ALL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS. AND INFORMATION ABOUT REAL ID IN HOUSE WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF KNOWING WHETHER THE MESSAGING RESONATES WITH TARGET AUDIENCES. A MAJOR COMMUNICATIONS AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGN IS VITALLY NEEDED IF WE WANT BETTER PREPARED CUSTOMERS. WE MUST CUT DOWN ON THE NEED FOR RETURN VISITS TO MITIGATE THIS ON THE UNPRECEDENTED VISIT SO WE HAVE. I STOP HERE TO REITERATE. THAT IF WE DO NOT COMMUNICATE WELL AND EFFECTIVELY TO THE DRIVING PUBLIC OF CALIFORNIA WE WILL SEE. EVEN MORE VISITS NEEDLESS VISITS TO THE TO THE DMV SERVICES. I MEAN SKEWS ME -- FIELD OFFICES. WE ALSO WANT TO INCREASE. OUR COMMUNICATIONS AROUND THE ID BY ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATION BOOTHS AT THE MAJOR CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS. TO TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT REAL ID AND OTHER DMV SERVICES THE STRIKE TEAM IN THE DMV ARE WORKING WITH THE TSA ON PLACEMENT OF THESE BOOTS. THE FIRST BOTH WENT UP LAST WEEK AT LA ACTS AND FRESNO AIRPORTS AND WILL CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AT SACRAMENTO SFO AND ONTARIO WERE WORKING WITH OTHER AIRPORTS TO EXPAND THE FOOT PRINTS OF THIS OUTRAGE. IN ANOTHER EFFORT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS VISITING A FIELD OFFICE TO COMPLETE TASKS THAT COULD BE DONE ONLINE WE NEED TO MODERNIZE THE DMV'S APPROACH TO AUTHENTICATING CUSTOMERS I DANITY. ON ONLINE SERVICES CURRENTLY DMV CUSTOMERS CAN CONFIRM THEIR ID ONLINE FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE AND IDENTIFICATION CARD APPLICATIONS. THIS SERVICE SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO STREAMLINE THE REAL ID APPLICATION PROCESS BY ALLOWING DMB CUSTOMERS TO UPLOAD AND STORE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS. BEFORE GOING TO A FIELD OFFICE THE GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS COMPLETE APPLICATION AND REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION. WHEN VISITING A FIELD OFFICE AND THAT THE PROCESS CAN BE COMPLETED QUICKLY AVOIDING A RETURN VISIT? THE FIELD OFFICE TECHNICIAN WOULD ONLY NEED TO VERIFY THE CUSTOMER'S DOCUMENTS THIS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE TRANSACTIONS TIME. AS WE LOOK TOWARD THE DMB OF THE FUTURE. THE STRIKE TEAM HAS PUBLISHED A REQUEST FOR QUOTE TO DEVELOP WORKPLACE STRATEGIES ANALYTICS THE NEWS RETAIL DESIGN TO PROVIDE THE BASICS OF A NEW DESIGN FOR ITS FIELD OFFICES THAT WOULD OPTIMIZE AND THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE. TO A MORE FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN INDEED IN DIEM BE OF THE FUTURE. WE WANT. PROTOTYPE DESIGNS THAT ELEVATE DMB WORK FLOW AND ENHANCE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WE WANT A WORKSTATION DESIGNED FOR PEAK PERFORMANCE OPTIMUM STATE STAFF PERFORMANCES AND STREAMLINED BUILDING SYSTEMS THAT REDUCE LONG TERM OPERATING COSTS. THERE MUST BE A COMP THERE MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE CHANGE IN HOW THE DMB OPERATES AND PROCESSES TRANSACTIONS. WE ARE NOT ONLY LOOKING AT NEW SPACES FOR THE DMV BUT WE A RE ENGINEERING PROCESSES. THE STRIKE TEAM AND THE DMV HAVE ENGAGE MCKINSEY AND COMPANY I THINK WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY THE LA JOH. TO HELP DMV FOCUS. THAT START OF ITS CULTURAL CHANGE ON IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AROUND THE REAL ID. THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO UNDERTAKE A SERIES OF THREE RELATED DESIGN SPRINTS FOCUSING ON COMMUNICATIONS EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND THE FIELD OFFICE ACTIVITIES FOR USING RELY DIS ISSUING SKEWS ME REAL ID'S. THEY ARE YOU USING FIELD OFFICE VISITS AND HAVE LAUNCHED A SURVEY TO LEARN. ABOUT T. RELY DEEMED MARKET SEGMENTS AND WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE TO GET IN OR NOT. ADD TO GET A REAL ID OBSERVATIONS FROM THESE VISITS. AN ANALYSIS OF FIELD OFFICE DATA WILL BE USED TO BUILD A FACT BASED TO UNDERSTAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANAGING CAPACITY. DEMAND AND THROUGHOUT. FOR THROUGH PUT SKEWS ME FOR REAL ID WHICH WILL BE CONVERTED TO POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS PROTOTYPES FOR OTHER AREAS WELL THE WORK IS FOCUSED ON PROCESSES SURROUNDING RELY DE. THESE LESSONS ON USER RESEARCH DESIGN BASED APPROACHES FOR PROTOTYPING AND FALL FOCUSING ON CUSTER MEANT BACKED SOLUTIONS WILL CASCADE AND TRANSLATE TO OTHER CENTRAL DMB FUNCTIONS. ANOTHER KEY AREA THAT BOTH THE STRIKE TEAM AND S. O. S. A HIGH -- SAY. IT TO THE AUDIT FOUND LACKING IS TRAINING TRAINING MATERIALS ARE OUT OF DATE AND WHILE THE DMB SETS ASIDE AN HOUR FOR TRAINING EACH WEEK IT IS UNCLEAR HOW WELL THIS TIME ISSUES AND HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS USED. THE LACK OF ROBUST TRAINING IS WHY WE ARE ORGANIZING A TRAINING STAND DOWN DAY THIS SUMMER. FOR ONE DAY WE WILL CLOSE DMV OFFICES TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE UNIFORM TRAINING IN ALL FIELD OFFICES FOR ALL EMPLOYEES. WHEN GAVIN NEWSOM GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM RECENTLY CELEBRATED HIS ONE HUNDREDTH DAY IN OFFICE HE REITERATED HIS COMMITMENT? TO RENEW AND REINVENT DMB TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S BEEN MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO TAKE ON THAT CRITICAL CHALLENGE ON HIS BEHALF AND YOURS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS AND MADAM CHAIR YOU ASKED ME TO ADDRESS. A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED EARLIER TONIGHT I'LL DO THAT NOW THANK YOU LET HER ON YOU WILL IT WAS PASSED BY BOTH. SENATOR STONE AND SENATOR JONES I BELIEVE WHAT STATES ARE DOING WELL WHAT STATES ARE DOING BETTER AND DID WE LOOK AT IT. THE STRIKE TEAM HAS -- LOOKED AT SEVERAL STATES AND WE'VE ALSO SPOKEN TO SEVERAL VENDORS THAT WE USE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT ALSO OUR VENDORS TO OTHER STATES. I WILL SAY THAT ALL OF THE STATES ARE STRUGGLING WITH. WITH REAL ID IMPLEMENTATION I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS DOING IT SWIMMINGLY. SOME WITH WITH THAT HAVE LESS VOLUME THAT WE THAN WE DO ARE DOING BETTER WE LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE STATE OF NEW YORK WE LOOKED AT INDIANA. WE LOOK AT WASHINGTON HAWAIIAN COLORADO. INDIANA HAS SOME VERY INTERESTING -- FIELD OFFICES THEY YEARS AGO UNDER GOVERNOR MITCH DANIELS MOVED REJECT VEHICLE REGISTRATION OUT OF THE FIELD OFFICE ENTIRELY SO THAT'S PROCESS BY A THIRD PARTY. PEOPLE AS MY UNDERSTANDING -- THEY ALSO CREATED A OFFICE OF THE FUTURE LOOKS KIND OF LIKE AN APPLE OFFICE IT IS ALL SELF SERVICE IT HAS IN THE WALL SERVICES. AND ON KIOSKS SO IT'S TWENTY FOUR SEVEN BUT THEY TO HAVE ARE ARE ALL WORKING HARD -- TO TO IMPLEMENT THE REAL ID UNDER YOU KNOW THESE DIFFICULT TIME FRAMES AND SOME STARTED EARLIER THAN OTHERS A ONE STATE I BELIEVE IT WAS OREGON EVEN TRIED. TO WITHDRAW THEMSELVES FROM IMPLEMENTATION FROM THE THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- I THINK IT WAS ALSO -- ASKED IF. THE THE WHETHER THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INFORMATION WHICH IS -- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH WILL BE PLACED IN MY AGENCY -- GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY WHETHER IT WILL BE LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES AT DMV. THAT -- WE ARE FORMING THAT NOW OF COURSE IT'S IN THE BUDGET NO BUDGET MUST BE APPROVED FIRST -- AS THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INFORMATION SERVICES IS IS PUT INTO PLACE AND OPERATIONALIZED -- POST JULY SHOULD THE BUDGET BE APPROVED -- WE MOST DEFINITELY WILL BE LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENTS AT DMV. ON I THINK SAID SENATOR PAN HAS LEFT BUT HE DID GO AHEAD RESPOND MEMBERS OF HAD TO GO TO A PROJECTIONS COMMITTEES OF THEIR STAFF CAN. FEEL THE MAN OKAY HE HE MENTIONED IN ASKS THE AUDITOR'S WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS A WAY TO BRING THE DMV TO INDEED THE PERSON. I MET LAST WEEK WITH IT WITH THE VENDOR WHO -- HAS HAS DONE SEVERAL NOT A CURRENT VENDOR DANDY HAS DONE SEVERAL START UPS IN FACT HE WAS VERY INVOLVED IN YELP. AND AND THEY HAVE A AN INTERESTING CONCEPT TO DO JUST THAT SOME SIMILAR. TO HOW WE NOW FUNCTION WITH ON LEFT AND WEBER WHERE INDEED YOU WOULD TAKE IT. AT DMV EMPLOYEE INTO THE HOME TO DO A DMV VISIT THAT IS IN THE NAY SEEIN -- RELEASED THE STAGES BUT I DID WANT SENATOR PAN TO KNOW THAT T'S SOMETHING THE STRIKE TEAM I HAVE MET PERSONALLY ON AND AND WE WILL FURTHER -- REVIEW I DIDN'T MENTION IN MY PREPARED REMARKS BUT PART OF THE EARLY ON EFFORT THAT I UNDERTOOK THE TEAM UNDERTOOK IN FEBRUARY WAS TO DO A PORT. FOLIO REVIEW IT REVIEW -- AS A RESULT OF THAT. WE LEARNED -- AS IT'S BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED AND STATED THAT THE I. T. STRUCTURE AT THE DMV IS FRAGILE -- THE D. M. V. EIGHT WHICH IS THE DATABASE NOT ONLY COLD BALL BUT ASSEMBLY -- WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTED IS USE THE LANGUAGE SO. WE HAVE HAVE -- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA TECH TOP THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND THE DMV OF UNDERTAKEN SOME -- WE SUGGESTED THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN SOME ACTIVITIES -- THAT WILL AND SECURE AND STABILIZE THE MIDDLE TIER OF THE STACK IF YOU WILL THAT AREA THAT HAS IBM PROPRIETARY FUNCTIONS AND SOME OF THE PROPRIETARY LANGUAGES THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT OVER THE YEARS. SO THOSE THOSE ARE F. PEAS ARE OFF OF THOSE ARE OUT ON THE STREET NOW AND WILL BE IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS -- SO WE CAN STABILIZE THE STACK AND SO WE CAN INDEED ADD ON OTHER TECHNOLOGIES LIKE FEZ IN A SUCCESSFUL MANNER -- THAT WILL NOT. TO USE A COMMON TERM BREAK THE BACK OF THE I. T. SYSTEMS A DMV I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIR -- THAT WERE RAISED I APPRECIATE YOU -- MADAM SECRETARY LET ME LET ME BEAGAIN BY ASKING -- KIND OF AN OVER ARCHING QUESTION -- WE HEARD THAT THE CHARGE OF THE STRIKE TEAM BY THE GOVERNOR WAS TO QUOTE. TO TO QUOTE YOU REINVENT THE DMV. AND MY QUESTION IS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT ROLE DO YOU PERCEIVE THE LEGISLATURE AS PLAIN AS YOU. WORK TO REINVENT THE DMB AND I ASKED THAT QUESTION FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE. WHEN THE DEPARTMENT IS IN CRISIS? PARTICULARLY A DEPARTMENT. THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL. IT'S PIVOTAL. TO THE EXPERIENCE OF EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. TO THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT BEHOOVES US. TO HAVE EITHER IN AN ANTAGONISTIC OR NON INCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. YOU'VE HEARD QUESTIONS AND YOU'VE HEARD THE LA L. SUGGESTS TO US IN RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION OF ESTABLISHING EXPECTATIONS A FRAMEWORK. YOU'VE HEARD MY COLLEAGUE TALK ABOUT. DEPARTMENTS COME IN ASKING FOR MONEY BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY WE HAVE A OVERSIGHT ROLE TO PLAY AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND SO IF YOU ARE UNDERTAKING A JOB AS SIGNIFICANT AND BIG AS REINVENTING A STATE DEPARTMENT. WHAT ROLE IS THE LEGISLATURE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE SUPPOSED TO PLAN THAT? A VERY AIM CENTRAL AND IMPORTANT ONE AS YOU SAID MADAM CHAIR EARLIER AND WE'VE HEARD INDIVIDUALLY FROM MANY MEMBERS BOTH FROM THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY. THIS IS EITHER THE NUMBER ONE OR THE NUMBER TO CONSTITUENTS ISSUE THAT YOU ARE FACED WITH. THAT MEANS IT'S A POLITICAL IMPERATIVE AND FOR FOR US IT IS A CUSTOMER SERVICE IMPERATIVE AND AS YOU SO WELL SAID NOW I'M CHAIR -- THE DMV IS S. SERVICES EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOUR COMMENT THAT -- IT SHOULD NOT BE A A CONFRONTATIONAL RELATIONSHIP IT SHOULD BE A PARTNERSHIP. AND THE THE LEGISLATURE I'VE I'M OF COURSE SECRETARY GOV OPS AND I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE DMV UNTIL THIS. RECENTLY SO I WASN'T INVOLVED IN ALL THE ACTIVITY LAST SUMMER AND FALL. BUT YOU PARTNER AND WITH THE DMV EXTRAORDINARILY WELL IN PROVIDING RESOURCES AND MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES AT THE TIME AND I SEE GOING FORWARD THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION THE STATE EVERY EVERY AGENCY EVERY DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO REPORT. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH THE IMPORTANT APPROPRIATIONS THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN US INTERESTED IN US? SO -- THE THE THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED TIME FOR CASH FOR DMV IT REALLY REALLY IS THE NUMBERS ARE HORRIFIC TO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO TRANSACT. TWICE AS MANY TRANSACTIONS AS THEY CURRENTLY ARE DOING IN ORDER TO GIVE THOSE PEOPLE A REAL ID WHO NEED NEEDS ONE BE FOUR OR NEED ONE BEFORE OCTOBER ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY I MEAN I I MENTIONED THAT WE'RE DOING THIS POP BUT DMV WITH HEALTH NET AND AS A PILOT. AND THAT YES INDEED DOES FOCUS ON BUSINESS TRAVELERS BUT OUR COMMERCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS VITALLY IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT MUST TRAVEL TO CONTINUE THE COMMERCE OF OF CALIFORNIA. THEY MUST HAVE A REAL IDE. UNLESS THEY ARE WILLING TO USE AND HAVE A PASSPORT BUT CERTAINLY NOT EVERYONE DOES. THOSE ARE SCARY NUMBERS TO ME FRANKLY. AND AND WEHAVE. TO BETWEEN NOW AND THEN IT WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN. TO ON TO INCREASE THE SUCCESSFUL ASH ONCE OF A REAL ID AND THAT IS AS I'VE OUTLINED THAT'S GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE FIELD OFFICES THAT DON'T NEED TO BE THERE. THAT CAN TRANSACT ELSEWHERE ONLINE. AT A KIOSK WE HAVE TO EVENTUALLY AFTER THE CRISIS PASSES AND AYE CONSIDERATE THAT. WE DO HAVE TO REINVENT THE DMB WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PROCESS IS AS WE ARE DOING WITH OUR PILOT WITH MACKENZIE THAT IS LOOKING AT HOW THE PROCESSES -- FUNCTION HOW THE DMV FIELD OFFICE FUNCTIONS AND REMOVING THOSE NON ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OR PROCESSES FRANKLY SOME OF THAT FLOW HAS BEEN THE SAME WAY SINCE PROBABLY WELL BEFORE YOU MANY OF YOU WERE BORN -- WE HAVE TO BRING IT INTO THE FUTURE. AND AS I SAID WE HAVE SIX MONTHS -- JULY IS WHEN I'M SUPPOSED TO RUN SORT OF HAND OFF TO THE NEXT FOLKS. OR THE DMV AND HOPEFULLY MANY OF OUR IDEAS ARE SHORT TERM AND MANY OF THEM ARE LONG TERM AND ALL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. THE POINT OF MY QUESTION IS GIVEN THE FACT THAT THESE NUMBERS AND THE EXPECTED WORKLOAD ARE UNPRECEDENTED. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT OUR STRATEGY IN TERMS OF THE PARTNERSHIP LOOK DIFFERENT TO THE STATUS QUO IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. TO SIMPLY COME TO US AROUND AN EXPECTATION FOR PROCREATION IS ON THE BACK IN AND OFTEN TOO LATE. AND SO THE POINT OF MY QUESTION IS BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY IN WHICH WE CAN PARTNER. NOT SIMPLY COMING TO BUDGET COMMITTEE. UP THROUGH APRIL FINANCE LETTERS TO JAIL BC REQUEST BUT EVEN -- MEMBERSHIP ON THE STRIKE TEAM SOME WAY IN WHICH WE ARE ENGAGED. AND SO WHEN IT'S TIME THAT WE HEAR THE PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE QUITE FRANKLY YOU HAVE ADVOCATES ON THIS SIDE OF THE TABLE AS WELL PEOPLE WILL PARTNER WITH YOU HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. AND AND FEEL AND HAVE A SENSE OF CONNECTION TO THE PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS I FULLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT MAY BE A DIFFERENT WAY IN WHICH A STRIKE TEAM THE ADMINISTRATION FINANCE IN THE LEGISLATURE. WORKS TOGETHER BUT AS YOU SAID THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IMPACTS EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. THAT WAS THE POINT OF MICHAEL QUESTION BUT I THINK WE NEED TO THINK CREATIVELY AS WELL IN TERMS OF HOW YOU ENGAGE US. ON THE FRONT IN TO PARTNER WITH YOU IN IDENTIFYING SOLUTIONS AND ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THEM APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE THE INNOVATIVE THINKING INTO AND DO. OUR FIRST SENATOR MINING FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DERIVE SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR ORGANIZING THIS OPPORTUNITY. WANT TO THANK THE PRESENTERS SIN -- IN MY QUESTION. TIM IS BAD TEACHER FOR YEAR LEADERSHIP ON THE STRIKE TEAM IT'S APPRECIATED. LET ME JUST PREFACE MY QUESTIONS -- WE DO HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS OF FRUSTRATIONS AND COMPLAINTS WE TRY IT. HELP TO THE EXTENT WE CAN. WE ALSO DO HEAR FROM SOME PEOPLE THAT -- APPRECIATE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY HAVE RECEIVED SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE IN THE BIG CHALLENGES -- THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DEDICATED STAFF THAT ARE TRYING TO MAKE. A TOUGH SITUATION BETTER INDEED -- THERE ARE -- SO I DO WANT TO JUST TAKE KNOWLEDGE THAT. A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE REAL ID -- WE HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY CONSTITUENTS WHO WENT TO THE DMV. PROVIDED THE DOCUMENTATION AND NOW READ IN THE NEWSPAPER THAT THAT DOCUMENTATION. PERHAPS WASN'T SUFFICIENT BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN WHAT'S REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- HAD A SOMEBODY WHO SECURED THEIR REAL ID. KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GONNA WORK FOR THEM WHEN THEY GO TO AN AIRPORT IN TWO YEARS. DOES THE END DMV REACH OUT AFFIRMATIVELY TO THOSE WHO WERE ISSUED A REAL ID BUT NOW REQUIRE FURTHER DOCUMENTATION DINO. SENATOR -- I'M AWARE OF THE WHOLE CIRCUMSTANCE AND AND COULD -- ANSWER THAT I THINK HOWEVER IT'S MUCH BETTER THAT -- ACTING DIRECTOR WEB ANSWER IT BECAUSE SHE IS A PERSON. WITH IN HOME AND WITH HOME AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN COMMUNICATING. SO I'D I'D I WILL DEFER TO HER OKAY IN THEM I AM GLAD TO FOLLOW UP. ON THE BIGGER RELY TEAM PICTURES SOUNDS LIKE FROM YOUR COMMENTS AND TRYING. TO MANAGE INCREASED DEMAND. LARGELY THROUGH REAL ID I BELIEVE WAS IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT RELY DE APPLICATION. DOES REQUIRE A PERSONAL INTERFACE BETWEEN THE APPLICANT YES WHETHER THEY HAVE A PRE EXISTING. CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE OR NOT THERE HAS TO BE AN INTERFACE THAT'S A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ASSIGNMENT YES IT IS SIR. SO AS WE TALK ABOUT KIOSKS AND REMOTE ACCESS AND IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE. IN THE PRESIDENT TO SECURE REAL ID REQUIRES. PRESENCE OF THE APPLICANT YES SIR IT DOES AND HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY MORE TRANSACTIONS MILLIONS OF TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DONE DAILY BY DIEM THE FIELD OFFICES. THAT INDEED COULD BE DONE ONLINE OR AT A KIOSK OR AT A TRIPLE A OFFICE AND SO ONE WAY TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE IN THE OFFICES. EXACT OR THAT CAN BE DONE FROM A HOME COMPUTER OR EVEN SUGGESTED -- A BUSINESS -- ENVIRONMENT AND SUPPORT YES YES LIKE THE POP PUNK YES SIR THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WE WANT TO GET AS MANY A 100% WOULD BE PERFECT. OF THOSE TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT NEED TO BE DONE WITHIN THE DMV OFFICE WE WANT THAT MOVED IN TO THE AREA WHERE THEY CAN BE TRANSACTED OUTSIDE OF THAT. THE FIELD OFFICE AND AGAIN PERHAPS THIS IS ALSO QUESTION FOR THE DMV BUT DO YOU NOW. DID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGE. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR DOCUMENT PRESENTATION YES THEY DID SIR AND AGAIN I AM THEY DID. AND AND ACTING DIRECTOR WELL WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT BUT THEY DID CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS ON ON CALIFORNIA'S WELL AS OF THE STATE'S. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SENATOR DORADO FOLLOWED BY CENTER NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY BEHIND IMMEDIATE. CHANGES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN THAT AT THE DMV AND THANK YOU ALL FOR FOR YOUR WORK. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME -- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT. ARE CHAIR HERE HAS SAID ABOUT MORE OF A CS IS PARTNERS TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK IS BECAUSE WE'VE SORT OF TREATED DIEM V. AS HERE'S A SERVICE TO GO GET. YOUR CAR REGISTERED TO GET A A DRIVER'S LICENSE IT'S NOT SEEN AS WHAT I THINK IT SHOULD BE WHICH IS. THIS IS A DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY THAT HAS TO DO WITH PUBLIC SAFETY. YOU KNOW DRIVERS YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT A DRIVER'S LICENSE YOU BETTER LEARN THE RULES OF THE ROAD. THAT'S PUBLIC SAFETY IT'S ABOUT CARS GETTING THEIR SMOG CHECK SO IT'S ABOUT CARS THAT ARE IN GOOD SHAPE AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. IT'S ABOUT GETTING INSURANCE IMAGINE ALL THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND BUSINESSES THAT RELY ON ON THAT YEAH. NOW WE RELY ON IT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IT'S A SECURITY SYSTEM I MEAN A DRIVER'S LICENSE IS ONE THING BUT A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND OR ON AIDID. ARE -- ARE WE DEPEND ON THEM TO BUY A USE OUR CREDIT CARDS YOU HAVE TO SHOW AN ID. ARE YOU HAVE THERE'S SO MANY WAYS IN WHICH WE HAVE TO SHOW A VALID ID SO IT'S A SECURITY DOCUMENT AS WELL. AND EVEN MORE SO NOW WITH THE REAL ID THAT YOU CAN EVEN TRAVEL SO. COMMERCE DEPENDS ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE DM B.. THE ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL THE ABILITYTO TRAVEL OUR AIRLINES WILL BE. SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED -- WITH THESE NEW RULES SO I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO HEAR. NOT ONLY THE PARTICULARS A WE WANT TANGIBLE PARTICULAR WAYS IN WHICH WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AND CHANGE THE OUTCOMES AND THE RESULTS. ARE ALSO ONE OF A VISION ABOUT HOW CRITICAL THIS AGENCY IS. TO EVERY CALIFORNIANS THIS IS NOT JUST SORT OF DID YOU GET GOOD SERVICE YOU KNOW CUSTOMER SERVICE WHEN YOU WENT TO GET YOUR YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE. THIS IS A VERY VERY BIG DEAL TO THE WHOLE STATE SO I GUESS I WANT. TO HEAR. HOW THAT VISION? FOR HAVE A IN OF DYNAMIC EFFECTIVE. AGENCY BECAUSE OF ITS IMPACT THROUGHOUT THE STATE THROUGH COMMERCE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. HOW THAT BECOMES A PART OF THIS RE INVENTING OF THE DMV NOT OKAY HOW MANY DO WE GET THROUGH THE DOOR TODAY? THAT'S A REALLY DIFFERENT ATTITUDE AND I I THINK WE NEED. TO DO BOTH. I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH I TOTALLY AGREE AND COULD NOT STATED BETTER THAN YOU IN TERMS OF ITS GLOBAL REACH. AND ITS GLOBAL IMPACT FROM COMMERCE AND AND AND AND IN YOUR LISTS CENTER I WOULD ADD ALSO THE COMMERCIAL LICENSING. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO -- AND IT SPINS WILL STATED ON HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS IT IT'S YOUR NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO ISSUE AND ALL OF YOUR OFFICES -- YOU YOU CAN'T MAKE IT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT I MEAN WE LITERALLY COULD JUST STOP FUNCTIONING AS A STATE IF THE DMB IS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. I HOPE OUR APPROACH IS GLOBAL IN NATURE IT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA IT'S WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PROCESSES OF THE OF THE ACTUAL FIELD OFFICE TO MODERNIZE THAT. WERE LOOKING AS I'VE TALKED IN MY TESTIMONY WE HAVE AN R. F.. O. OUT ON THE STREET NOW. TO BRING IN ARCHITECTURAL FIRMS THAT WILL LOOK AT THE FLOW AND HOW YOU ARCHITECT AND DESIGN FOR BETTER MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE. AND PLACEMENT OF OF OF THE SERVICING OF THOSE PEOPLE ALL IN IN THE END RESULT TO BE NOT JUST GIVING GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT'S CRITICAL BUT MAKING SURE THAT THE FUNCTIONING OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CAN CONTINUE BECAUSE MUCH OF OF OF THE HEART OF IT IS INDEED THE FUNCTION OF DAM THE ISSUE SO WELL STATED THE THE AGENCY. DO YOU EMPLOY WHAT ARE KIND OF INTERNAL. TELL THE OVERSIGHT THROUGHS SUCH. MECHANISM IS UP BUT BUNCH MEN. OF ADVOCATES CITIZEN ADVOCATE SEED OF IT OR INSPECTOR GENERAL THIS WITH ANY OF THOSE APPLY TO THE THE DMB. WELL SIR -- I'M THE HEAD OF THE STRIKE TEAM AND THE DMV. RESIDES IN THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY NOT WITHN GOV OPS SO LET THEM ADDRESS THAT HOWEVER YES THERE ARE NONE ON BEDS PERSONS -- CENTER ROTH IS VERY WELL AWARE OF HOW THOSE UNCTIONS WORK AT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. AND THERE IS AN INSPECTOR GENERAL AT CALTRANS SO I KNOW FUNCTIONS LIKE THAT OPERATE IN AGENCIES AND AT DEPARTMENTS IN. IN DIFFERENT OVERSIGHT CAPACITIES AND GIVE. A VOICE -- TO AN INDEPENDENT VOICE TO PEOPLE THAT USE THE SERVICES AS ICE MENTION LIKE F. T. B. FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS NOT THE SUBJECT TO THIS HEARING BUT ANOTHER [inaudible] BIG RESPONSIBILITY. FOR STOOD ON YOU YEARS AGO WAS MOTOR VOTER. THE EVENT PROBLEMS WITH THAT. NOW IT. HAS THAT NOW DIMINISHED IS A PROBLEM FOR YET SUFFICIENTLY THAT YOU CAN REDIRECT RESOURCES NOW. TO THIS MORE REAL ID THING THAT'S AT MORE CLOSELY BEFORE OTHER AGAIN SIR I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION BETTER ON POSED AND ANSWERED BY ACTING DIRECTOR WEB. DO THAT THEN WITH THEM OKAY THANK YOU SIR AND THEN THE LAST WAY I'D DESCRIBE TO THE TEARS. THE SUGGESTION OF WHAT I PLAN TO CALL OUR INTERACTIVE FOR THE PARTICIPATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER INTERESTS. AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE HIGHWAY PATROL. TO VERY MUCH A PARTNER THANK YOU SIR TO STONE. THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY IN SIZE -- TO SEE YOU AND I'M ALSO -- AND AGREE WITH SENATOR NELSON IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU AS A PART OF THE STRIKE TEAM AND AND I AND I AGREE WITH ALL MY COLLEAGUES THAT CHIU YOU'VE -- EMBRACE THE THE LEGISLATURE HAVING A KEY ROLE IN AND HELPING TO BASICALLY TAKE A DEPARTMENT IN DISARRAY AND PUT IT BACK ON TRACK TO BEING -- PROUD DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SAY THAT WITH A COUNTY GOT THAT I WOULD SAY THE 90% OF OUR EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES ARE REALLY GREAT PEOPLE -- I GO THERE AND THEY STRIVE TO TO REALLY HELP IN. LEADERSHIP STARTS OF THE TOP. AND SO WHAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING ON THIS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE THANK YOU ANY AND YOU BROUGHT FORWARD TO A LOT OF INTERESTING -- COMMENTS AND ONE OF THEM IS -- THE CREDIT CARD ISSUE -- YOU KNOW WE'RE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE BASICALLY THE CAPITAL OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD SENATOR BILL KNOWS THAT IT REPRESENTS THAT AREA -- I CAN GO INTO A STORE THAT ACCEPT APPLE PAY I COMPLETE MY PHONE AND SECURELY I CAN PAY MY BILL IN TWO SECONDS. THEY KNOW WHAT'S MINE NOBODY CONTRACT THAT CREDIT CARD NOBODY CAN HACK THAT CREDIT CARD -- I WOULD URGE YOU TO OUR RECHARGE THE SUMMER TECHNOLOGICAL COMPANIES THAT. WHETHER BE APPLE OR SOMEBODY ELSE -- AND I I'D I'D PERSON UNDERSTAND WHY WE NEED WE NEED A PILOT EVERY EVERY STORE -- EVERY OPERATION IT SEEMS LIKE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU WANT TO GET THE POINTS ARE SLIDING THEIR CREDIT CARDS -- THE ISSUE OF OF CREDIT CARD FEES ARE GOING TO COME UP -- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE THE STATE ABSORBING OR YOU SEE THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO BE AN ADDED. COST TO A CONSUMER WHEN THEY COME HEY WITHIN THE BUDGET -- CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE AND THE COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE NOW -- IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE CONVENIENCE FEE WOULD BE PAID AND ABSORBED BY THE CUSTOMER OKAY ANSWERING I THINK IT'S IT'S USUALLY AROUND ONE OR 2% I DON'T THINK THAT'S DIFFERS. IN IN THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS I THINK IT FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IT'S TWO POINT 7%. BUT WE HAVE A HIGHER VOLUME THE FRESH TASTE THE HEX BOARDS SO SO. YEARS AGO WITH THE POST OFFICE TRIED TO DO TO LIMIT THE THE TRAFFIC IN THE POST OFFICE IS A LOUD OFFSITE PEOPLE TO SELL POSTAGE STAMP FORGET ABOUT GROCERY STORE TODAY. SO WE HAVE A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP I GUESS YOU CAN SAY WITH TRIPOLI THAT SENATOR MORE LIKE REFER TO DO. WHY DO WE GIVE THEM THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO A PARTNERSHIP LIKE THAT WHY WHEN WE INCLUDE COMPANIES LIKE ALL STATER? OR OTHER INCH INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT DEAL WITH CAR INSURANCE -- AUTOMATIC IF I WENT INTO A MY INCH INSURANCE AGENCY. I WOULD PAY THE EXTRA TEN BUCKS IF IT MEANT I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO THE DMV AND DO THAT PAPERWORK IF THEY COULD DO IT RIGHT THERE AND AND RECEIVE A FEE FOR A FOR FOR DOING THAT ON OFF TRIPOLI GETS A FEE FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- HOW THAT WORKS BUT WHY WOULD WE DISALLOW ONE INSURANCE COMPANY TO HAVE THAT MONOPOLY IF YOU WILL OF PROVIDING A STATE SERVICES YOU GET NOWHERE ELSE EXCEPT THE DMV? CENTER STONE I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE RESTRICTIONS THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS WHICH I THINK THERE'S A THE OF A BILL -- I KNOW THERE IS AT LEAST A IDEA. OF THE FOR A BILL PROPOSAL AND THAT WOULD EXPAND THE SERVICES THAT ARE BUSINESS PARTNERS -- CAN PROVIDE FOR ON THE DMV AND I KNOW I'VE MET WITH THE AUTO CLUB'S BOTH OF NORTH IN THE NORTH AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY ARE REALLY EAGER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE SERVICES BUT I'LL LET -- THE DMB EXPLAIN I'M I'M NOT SURE OF THE EXCLUSIVITY OR THE LEAGUE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS PATIENTS AT ALL FOLLOW UP WITH THEM. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THEN THIS LASTLY -- YOU KNOW THE FINALS. WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO MILLENNIALS ESPECIALLY WITH THE RELY DE AND THE WAY HE REACH HIM IS UNFORTUNATELY AFTER THESE MACHINES RIGHT LATELY AND GETTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA SO -- I'M GOING TO URGE THAT WE COMMUNICATE BETTER ON SOCIAL MEDIA I'M I'M GOING TO ASK THE THE DIRECTOR BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR REAL ID EXCITER CONFLICTING. REPORTS I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MINE YET SO I DO WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE 20% TO GO TO THE DMV THEY DO NOT. HAVE THE RIGHT INFORMATION YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND LASTLY I'M GONNA SAY THAT. WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO THE DMV THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONE STATE AGENCY THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT'S REALLY THE FACE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE A GOOD EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY GO TO THE DMV -- AND AND BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE THEIR SERVICES GET THEM AND GET THEM% OUT GET THEM THE DOCUMENTS THAT THEY NEED ESPECIALLY THE COMMERCIAL WHICH WAS VERY WELL WELL ARTICULATED. AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS THANK YOU SIR AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT IT WITHIN THE PROPOSAL IS ON A AND I ASK. THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO ASK. FOR MONEY. TO DO A ENTIRELY NEW I TESTIFY TO IT CAMPAIGN WHICH HEAVILY WILL USE -- IF IF IT'S APPROVED EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATE BETTER THAN WE HAVE WITH THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ON ALL MEDIUMS. THANK YOU FOR BEING AND CHANNELS. AND WITH REGARD TO YOUR PLAN TO SHUT DOWN FOR A FULL DAY OF TRAINING YES YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE LEADING NEWS ISSUE -- THE LEADING TRAILER FOR ALL NEWS MEDIUM WHEN STARBUCKS WAS ON A CALLS FOR DAY FOR THEIR TRAINING EVERYBODY KNEW IT AND SO I HOPE THAT AS A PART OF YOUR OUT REACH CAMPAIGN I HAVE SAID. EVERYONE KNOWS THE DMV IS GOING TO BE CLOSED THIS DAY THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY AND I'VE SPOKEN OR STARBUCKS ABOUT HOW THEY WENT ABOUT THAT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT SENATOR MORLOCK FOLLOWED BY SENATOR ROBB SURE -- FEEDBACK I'VE GOTTEN FROM MY CONSTITUENTS IS -- WE ARE. GOING TO RENT A HOTEL ROOM. AND WE'RE GONNA DRIVE PALM SPRINGS FROM ORANGE COUNTY TO GO TO THE DMV BECAUSE THE OFFICES. WE CAN GET TO IN AND OUT OF A QUICKER SO THAT'S THE FEEDBACK I'VE BEEN GETTING. OUT IN PUBLIC SO I'M A LITTLE FRUSTRATED THAT THUNDERSTONE IS GETTING. P. O. T. REVENUES IN. SALES TAX REVENUES BECAUSE MY CONSTITUENTS ARE GOING TO PALM SPRINGS TO GO TO THEIR DIEM BE. FOR ALL THAT JUST SOME ANECDOTAL INFORMATION FOR YOU. BREAK COVERED THE SERVICE FEE YOU KNOW THE IDEA IT WOULD WE WE FIGHTING GOVERNMENT FOR THE LONGEST TIME HAVING TO DEAL WITH EMERGING FAIR FEE WITH VISA AND ALL THE REST. SO OUR OUR OTHER DEPARTMENTS ALSO HAVE A ALSO KNOWN NOT. IMPLEMENTED THE ABILITY TO USE CREDIT CARDS FOR THE SAME REASON. THERE TEN I'M AWARE OF THAT THERE IN OUR RESEARCH THAT THEIR TEN DEPARTMENTS WITHIN CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT THAT OFFER CREDIT CARDS AND ALL. TEN OF THEM -- CHARGE A CONVENIENCE FEE TO THE TO THE CUSTOMER -- PART OF THE ISSUE AT THE DMV OF WHY THIS HAD. NOT BEEN ACCEPTED EARLIER WAS CONCERNED WITH THEIR IT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE CREDIT CARD PROCESSING COMPANIES HAVE ADVANCED. AS WE ALL WELL KNOW AND YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN BUY YOUR YOUR GIRL SCOUT COOKIES WITH A CREDIT CARD NOW HAD THE GIRLS GET OUT TO HIM IN TIME ME -- BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN CONNECTIVITY WAS AN ISSUE FROM THE FIELD OFFICES TO THE HEADQUARTERS. TECHNOLOGY HAS HAS OVER. REACHED THAT AND THE YOU ASKED IF I'D MET WITH THE CREDIT CARD PROCESSING COMPANIES ALMOST EVERYONE OF THEM IT SEEMS TO TAKE SO WE WERE ABLE -- TO ALONG WITH THE ASSESSMENT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IT DIEM BE. ASSESSED THE CREDIT CARD PROCESSING COMPANIES. AND SOME OF THE I. D. AUTHENTICATION COMPANIES AND INDEED THEY WERE THOSE THAT ANSWERED THE R. S. P. AND WERE ABLE TO GO INTO THE TEST ENVIRONMENT AT DMV AND TEST WHETHER OR NOT -- THEY COULD WORK WITH IN THE FRAGILE AND UNSTABLE STRUCTURE. AT THE DMV AND WILL BE LEARNING THAT AND THIS WEEK I BELIEVE BECAUSE THE TEST THE TESTING AT THE LAB WAS DONE THE LAST TWO WEEKS. I THINK I'M I THINK I HAVE THAT RIGHT. I TO HAVE DEALT WITH THESE MERCHANT FEES AT HAVING BEEN A FORMER TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR WHEN. PROPERTY OWNERS WANTED TO PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAXES WE HAD A CHARGE OF A 3% FEE WHICH ON CERTAIN HOMES CAN BE QUITE A BIG. SURCHARGE AS THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. THE I WANTED SERIOUS MILEAGE FOR THEIR PLANE CREDIT CARD RESERVE SIGN. SO. SO I'D LIKE TO TRY TO MEET WITH THE INDUSTRY TO SAY WAIT A SECOND I'M NOT A RETAIL SHOP. THAT'S TRYING TO COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL SHOPS AND THAT'S WHY I PAY FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF HAVING YOUR CREDIT CARD I'M A GOVERNMENT. I I DON'T. NO I I IS I'M JUST WONDERING NOW THAT WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO'S GOING AFTER SAY FARM. PHARMACY AND DRUG COSTS MAYBE WE COULD COLLABORATE. MAYBE THE COUNTY TREASURER'S AND SAY HEY WAIT A SECOND WHY ARE WE BEING CHARGED. SUCH A HI FI LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WHEN SHOULD GIVE US A GOVERNMENT RATE IN. JUSTIN IDEAS YOU RIGHT FINISH THE STRIKE TEAM OPPORTUNITY IF SO THE STRIKE TEAM IS IT SHORT TERM. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN YOUR POSITION? I'M SECRETARY OF GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AND I'VE BEEN IN THAT POITION SINCE JULY OF TWENTY THIRTEEN THE GOVERNOR NAME ME TO HEAD UP THE DMB STRIKE TEAM -- ALONG WITH MY DUTIES AS SECRETARY GOV UPS. IN JANUARY SO SINCE JANUARY AND HE ASKED US TO DO -- OUR WORK WITHIN SIX MONTHS SO. ON WE HAVE SIX MONTHS TO STRIKE. SO THEN WHAT OTHER DEPARTMENTS RENDER YOUR SUPERVISION AND IF I HAD ELEVEN DEPARTMENTS I HAVE WHAT WE CALL THE THREE CONTROL AGENCIES -- WHICH I DON'T LIKE THAT TERM BUT DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. THE CALLIE T. R. AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY I HAVE THE TWO MAJOR RAISE REVENUE COLLECTING DEPARTMENTS FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT BOARD BUT SEVERAL IS WITHIN GOV OPTION I HAVE A CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FEE IN. TAX ADMINISTRATION I HAVE CALPERS AND CAL STIRS I HAVE -- VICTIMS COMPENSATION WHICH I CHAIR. THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION IS ALSO SOMETHING I CHAIR ON THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS WITHIN GOV OPS -- FISCAL HAS ONE FOOT IN GOV OPS UNTIL THE PROGRAM IS COMPLETELY. FINISHED AND THEN IT WILL COME OVER INTO GOV OPS -- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ELEVEN BUT I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD. SO I COME FROM THE COUNTY STRUCTURE IN SEBRING DEPARTMENT HEADS AND I I'VE BEEN A LITTLE FRUSTRATED AS IT IS A STATE SENATOR THAT. IN HOUSES PLACE RUNNING AND WHO DO YOU CALL AND FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. SO WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM THE DMV WE GET A HEARING RIGHT AND THAT'S ONE HEARING YEAR MAYBE AND THEN I I GET YOUR FOR MAYBE THIRTY MINUTES. AND I GET LIKE TO ASK ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS FOR FIVE MINUTES WHICH IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT ANIMAL THAN BEING A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. HOW HOW? HOW DO WE? TRY TO HELP THE STATE MANAGE ITSELF BETTER -- YOU KNOW NOT TO BE REAL DIRECTED YOU COULD KIND OF TELL DEPARTMENT HEAD YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAD AN AUDIT THAT WAS MISERABLE. THIS IS AWFUL. DO YOU WANT A PICTURE DEPARTMENT OR DO YOU WANT TO FIX YOUR RESUME I MEAN WHAT. WHAT WE DOING HOW DID WE GET HERE SO WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S A GOOD TIP FOR A SENATOR TO TO SOMEHOW? HELP YOU BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF YOU KNOW GIVE A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT. WELL DEPARTMENTS DO NOT GET INTO CORACLE BAD SHAPE OVERNIGHT. AND FRANKLY THEY DON'T GET OUT OF QUOTE UNQUOTE BAD SHAPE OVERNIGHT AND IT IS -- THE TWO BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT WORKING TOGETHER THAT MAKE GOVERNMENT FUNCTION -- AND WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH BUDGETS WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH POLICY ISSUES -- THERE ARE LOTS OF STATUTES THAT GOVERN THE WORK OF AND SEND THE WORK TO FRANKLY THE DMV SO. AS THE AS MADAME CHAIR SAID -- THERE ARE NEEDS TO COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER THAT I THINK WILL BE ARE THERE IS A NEED TO COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER THAT'S ALWAYS THERE AND WE CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER WITH IT -- YOU ALL HAVE YOUR IN THE FRONT LINES WITH THE CONSTITUENTS WITH THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AS QUICK AS AS EFFECTIVELY AS WE CAN AND WE CAN DO THAT BY WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH YOU. AND GAINING YOUR IDEAS AND THOSE OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS BUT DO YOU ASK YOUR DEPARTMENT HEADS FOR AN ANNUAL BUSINESS PLAN WHICH WOULD ALL OF MY DOG ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS HAVE STRATEGIC PLANS -- WHICH EQUATE I THINK TO BUSINESS PLANS -- THEY ALL ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO HAVE WORK FORCE PLANS. AND YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS YOU CAN HAVE A WORKFORCE PLAN AND KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH YOUR WORKFORCE OF YOU DON'T HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN WE HAVE TOTALLY RE DONE AN AREA OF CALLIE CHAR. ON TO ASSIST -- DEPARTMENTS IN PUTTING THEIR WORK FORCE PLANSTOGETHER -- WE HAVE BLUFF DOT AND RE. INVIGORATED AND RE OPENED THE TRAINING CENTER IN. CALIFORNIA THAT CALLIE CHAR IN ORDER TO HELP -- DEPARTMENTS TO A MUCH BETTER JOB AT WORKFORCE PLANNING AND STRATEGIC PLANNING. A LITTLE OFF SUBJECT. HAS THE DMV IS WAS NOT ONE OF YOUR DEPARTMENT SO. IT IS NOT SECRETARY OF THE DMV HAS THAT PERSON BEEN ASKING FOR STRATEGIC PLANS AND WORK FORCE PLANS OVER THE LAST. TEN YEARS I THINK THE YES THE AND AGAIN -- ACTING DIRECTOR WEB CAN ADDRESS THAT BUT YES THE DMB DOES HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU SENATOR RAW THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN SECRETARY GOOD TO SEE YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU SIR THANKS FOR TAKING THE SON I KNOW.

YOU ARE NOT -- IN A PARTICULARLY ENVIABLE POSITION HAVING TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THIS REAL ID MASS AND ALL THE OTHER SERVICES THAT THE DMV PROVIDES AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU AND THE DEPARTMENT REINVENT THE DEPARTMENT. BUT I HAVE TO SAY IN THIS IS IN THE NATURE OF A COMET MADAM CHAIR THAT. MA'AM SECTORS YOU ROOM RECALL AS A AS A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR -- NOT TOO MANY YEARS AGO YEAR -- TO I HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH YOU ONE OF ON FRANKLY A MAJOR. VERY DIFFICULT REORGANIZATION -- OF GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS IN THIS STATE AND YOU DID SO SUCCESSFULLY. AND IN TERMS OF THE COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DISCUSSED A FROM THIS DíAS I HAVE NO DOUBT. AND SINCE YOU DEMONSTRATED IT DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME -- THAT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN. IN YOUR ACTIVITIES IN THOSE SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT IN REINVENTING THAT DEPARTMENT AT THE SAME TIME. AS THE DEPARTMENT MEETS THE CHALLENGE OF ROLLING THESE REAL ID'S OUT. TO COMPLY WITH THE THE FEDERAL RULE SO I LOOK FORWARD INTO PARTICIPATING THAT PROCESS WITH YOU AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR TAKING ON THIS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TASK THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND IN IN A FOLLOWING UP ON SENATOR ROSS COMMENT -- I GUESS THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY MY ASSUMPTION THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ONGOING ROLE I'VE HEARD THAT THE STRIKE TEAM WAS -- ASKED TO COMPLETE ITS WORK IN SIX MONTHS WE WERE AND HE TOLD THE WILL WILL THERE BE A HARD STOP.

WELL THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING CHAIRWOMAN MITCHELL AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND PULL THE MICHAEL CLOSER TO YOU. WE WILL HAVE TO STRAIN THANK YOU LETTER. I AM KATHLEEN WEB ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND WITH ME IS ROBBIE CROCKETT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES DIVISION. THE ALLEY -- PROVIDED A GOOD BACKGROUND REGARDING THE FEDERAL COMPLIANT REAL ID CARD I WANT TO PROVIDE MORE PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE THE FUTURE IMPACTS TO DMV. AND THE REASON FOR OUR TO JAIL BC REQUESTS IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET REQUEST. THE DMV ESTIMATES TWENTY EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION CUSTOMERS WILL CHOOSE TO GO TO A FEDERALLY COMPLIANT REAL ID CARD. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WITH A POSSIBLY THIRTEEN MILLION OF THOSE CALMER CUSTOMERS COMING BETWEEN NOW. AND OCTOBER FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY I WANT TO STRESS WE ANTICIPATE THIRTEEN MILLION CUSTOMERS COMING TO THE DMV IN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS HOWEVER. AS SECRETARY BACHELOR REST RATE RAISED WE KNOW THAT WE ALSO HAVE RETURN CUSTOMERS OF ALMOST 20%. DUE TO LACK OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION AWARENESS WHICH EQUATES TO THREE MILLION MORE CUSTOMERS COMING INTO FIELD OFFICES. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT THESE ARE TRULY HISTORIC ON PRESIDENT NUMBERS. ARE BUDGET REQUEST WILL ENSURE WE KEEP WAIT TIMES UNDER AN HOUR. NOT GETTING THESE BUDGET REQUEST APPROVAL RESULT IN US RETURNING TO EXTENSIVE WAIT TIMES THAT WERE EXPERIENCE LAST SUMMER. OR WORSE. BASED IN OUR ESTIMATES IF CUSTOMERS STARTED VISITING FIELD OFFICES EVENLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. DMV IS LOOKING AT SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND PER MONTH FOR A REAL ID WHICH CLOSELY REPRESENTS THE POPULATION OF SAN FRANCISCO OR GREATER FRESNO AREA EVERY MONTH. CURRENTLY DMV ISSUES A PROXY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND REAL ID'S PER MONTH. AND TO DATE HAS ISSUED OVER THREE POINT FIVE MILLION REAL ID'S. THIS HISTORIC SCALE OF ALL THE CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE YET TO COME IS A HUGE CHALLENGE. AND REQUIRES THE ENVY TO RESPOND DECISIVELY. EFFICIENTLY AND SWIFTLY ENSURING WE HAVE THE EMPLOYEES THE PUBLIC OUTRAGE STAFF TRAINING AND I TEAM PERFORMANCE IN PLACE TO FACE THE CHALLENGE AND SUCCESSFULLY. ENSURE WAIT TIMES REMAIN CONSTANT. DMV HAS THREE SEPARATE PENDING BUDGET REQUESTS WE HAVE TO CURRENT YEAR JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE REQUEST. AND WORKING WITH THE STRIKE TEAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE CREATED A BUDGET PROPOSAL REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TERM PROVED IN VAIN. WE KNOW THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT ASSN ONE TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS FOR YOU. JAIL BC REQUEST OF FORTY POINT FOUR MILLION IS NEEDED TO REIMBURSE DMV FUNDS USED TO DECREASE WAIT TIMES FROM AUGUST TO FEBRUARY. BY SIXTY FOUR MINUTES AND SINCE LAST OCTOBER MAINTAINING IT AVERAGE STATEWIDE WAIT TIME OF LESS THAN ONE HOUR. DMV HAD TO SPEND FROM FUNDS NOT BUDGETED FOR CONTINUED SATURDAY SERVICES. OVERTIME HOURS AND TO PAY FOR LOAN STAFF FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT SUPPORTED DMV AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY HIRES. THE FUNDS WE ARE REQUESTING WENT TOWARDS OUR SUCCESSFUL EFFORT PROVIDING EXPANDED HOURS OF OPERATION THAT INCLUDED. SATURDAY SERVICES AND SIXTY TWO OFFICES EXTENDED HOURS AT FOURTEEN OFFICES OVERTIME HOURS. INCREASE PERMANENT INTERMITTENT HOURS RETIRED IN NEW A TENSE AND STAFF LOAN FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND STAFF TRAINING. WE CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THESE RESOURCES HELP REDUCE WAIT TIMES FROM AN AVERAGE HIGH I AUGUST OF A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MINUTES. TO AN AVERAGE IN FEBRUARY OF FIFTEEN MINUTES THIS IS A REDUCTION OF SIXTY FOUR MINUTES. HOWEVER WITHOUT THE APPROVAL THIS SPECIFIC FORTY POINT FOUR MILLION REQUEST WE WOULD NEED TO DRASTICALLY CUT FROM OUR BUDGET. IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. THIS WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES AND RESULT IN A MEDIA ACTIONS THAT MAY INCLUDE. AMONG OTHER THINGS ENDING THE SATURDAY OFFICE HOURS AND ALL EXPANDED HOURS. STAFF REDUCTION THAT FIELD OFFICES AND NO OVERTIME IMPOSSIBLE DELAYS TO OTHER DMV SERVICES TO RECOVER COSTS ALREADY SPENT. FOR REDUCING WAIT TIMES. THIS WOULD RESULT A CUSTOMER WAIT TIMES RETURNING TO THOSE HISTORIC LEVELS THAT WE ALL EXPERIENCED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR WORSE. THE SECOND JAIL BC REQUEST FOR SIX MILLION IS A JUMPSTART ON SELECT REQUEST OF THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER TO PREPARE FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN SUMMERS ORANGE. THIS REQUEST INCLUDES HIRING AND TRAINING OF THREE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL TEMPORARY POSITIONS. A ONE DAY TRAINING OF ALL FIELD OFFICE IN CALL CENTER STAFF TO ENSURE CONSISTENT AND EFFICIENT DELIVERY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. IT INITIAL MEDIA OUTREACH CAMPAIGN ON REAL ID AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE DMV WEBSITE. FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THE DV IS REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. THESE REQUESTS REPRESENTS AN 18% TIME BOUND INCREASE IN BUDGET AND RESOURCES. TO HANDLE THIS UNPRECEDENTED A 100% INCREASE IN TRANSACTIONS ASSOCIATE WITH REAL ID IMPLEMENTATION AND INTENDED TO MAINTAIN WAIT TIMES AND PROVIDE EFFECTIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE COMPLETE BUDGET REQUEST WILL OUT DMB TO FUND NINETEEN HUNDRED PREDOMINATELY TEMPORARY POSITIONS. AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO MEET A MISSION CRITICAL OBJECTIVE. PROVIDING THIRTEEN MILLION MORE REAL ID'S SUCCEEDING THROUGH THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS IS THE HIGHEST SHORT TERM PRIORITY. FUNDING WILL GO TO IMPROVE TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS ARE GETTING HIGH QUALITY AND EFFICIENT SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. INCREASED REGIONAL MANAGEMENT AND APPROVED OVERSIGHT OF FIELD OFFICE OPERATIONS TO ENSURE THAT TRAINING AND SERVICE IS IMPLEMENTED CONSISTENTLY. A LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW FOR ON LINE TRAINING THROUGH E. LEARNING MODELS. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET REQUEST WILL HELP INNOVATE DMV. FIGHTING READILY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY IN THE SHORT TERM BUT ALSO IN THE LONG TERM. AMONG THEM ACCEPTING CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS AND FIELD OFFICES AND OFFERING OTHER TECHNOLOGIES USED BY MANY RETAILERS TODAY TO BETTER SERVE CUSTOMERS BY PROVIDING ON LINE CHAT. CUSTOMER SERVICE EMAIL CHAT BOT. A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT SERVICE THAT INCLUDES A LIVE CHAT SERVICES. THESE TECHNOLOGY COSTA PROXY FOURTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WITH A FIVE POINT SEVEN ONE TIME FUNDING -- EACH ALTERNATIVE SERVICE CHANNEL PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WTH THE IN THE IN THE MANNER THEY PREFER. GETTING ANSWERS TO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AS APPROPRIATE REJECT RE DIRECTING THEM AWAY FROM THE FIELD OFFICE TO SERVICES PROVIDED ONLINE. THROUGH THE CALL CENTER OR SELF SERVICE KIOSKS. THE NINE POINT FIVE MILLION REQUESTS FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS CAMPAIGN IS A KEY COMPONENT TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS. IT IS VITAL TO OUR SUCCESS THIS WOULD BE USED FOR VARIOUS MEDIA CHANNELS AIMED AT REDUCING WAIT TIMES BY BETTER INFORMING THE PUBLIC. AND INCLUDES TARGETING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES REGARDING WHICH TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE FIELD OFFICE VISIT HOW TO USE ALTERNATE CHANNELS SUCH AS ALL MY CHAOS. UP ONLY SERVICES OR CHAOS AND WHAT DOCUMENTATION TO BRING IN FOR REAL ID AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES CRITICAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING REPLACEMENT OF OUTDATED UNRELIABLE HARDWARE SUCH AS TERMINALS SERVERS AND CIRCUITS. AND EXPANDED NETWORK REDUNDANCIES TO STABILIZE THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT IS FRAGILE AND AT RISK OF FAILURE. AT A COST OF SIXTEEN POINT NINE MILLION. THIS PROPOSAL WILL REDUCE VULNERABILITY TO ALLERGIES SO THE DMV IS NOT HINDERED BY TECHNICAL OUTAGES AND FAULTY EQUIPMENT. YES WE ARE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT REQUEST TO INCREASE DMV'S BUDGET BY 18%. BUT IT DOES PROVIDE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR DMV TO ADDRESS THESE THE STORK IN ON PRESIDENT LEVELS TO ACCOMPLISH TO MAINTAIN. WAIT TIME REDUCTIONS IN PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE SERVICE. TO ENSURE FULFILLMENT OF OUR GOALS AND MEASURE OUTCOMES. A BUSINESS WORK PLAN IS BEING FINALIZED THAT WILL INCLUDE PERFORMANCE METRICS. AND TIME LINES FOR DELIVERY. GOING BACK TO SOMETHING YOU SHARE EARLIER BY COULD INTERRUPT WEST SECOND AND WILL THAT PLAN B. DEVELOP BEFORE -- THE JUNE FIFTEENTH VOTE ON A BUDGET. I WOULD SAY IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED IS GOING THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS RIGHT NOW THANK YOU. SO I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE COLDER AREA EARLIER IS I BELIEVE IT'S TOGETHER. WE MUST ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES THAT WILL ALLOW THE DMV TO CARRY ON THEIR PART IN KEEPING OFFICES OPEN. MANAGING WAIT TIMES AND PROACTIVELY FACE THE CHALLENGE OF SURVEYING AGAIN THIS IS STORK NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AT THIRTEEN MILLION. THAT WILL BE COMING INTO FIELD OFFICES FOR REAL ID'S ALONG WITH BEGINNING THE JOURNEY TO MODERNIZE AND CREATE THE DMV OF THE FUTURE. ONE THAT IS BETTER EQUIPPED TO SERVE OUR CHILDREN. I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME TODAY AND I AM AVAILABLE TO ANSWER I'M SURE MANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY IS TODAY. BEFORE I MOVE ON TO FINANCE -- THERE WERE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS WERE NO LONGER HERE -- COULD YOU. ADDRESS SOME OF THE SOME NOTES DOWN GREAT SO -- I THINK ONE OF THE ONES I WANT TO ADDRESS FIRST OFF IS ON THE REAL ID REQUIREMENTS WE DO HAVE A CHECKLIST ON OUR WEBSITE. THAT IDENTIFIES THE DOCUMENTS THAT THEY NEED TO BRING IN WITH THEM -- WE MAKE THIS CHECKLIST AVAILABLE I THINK THE THING IS IT'S NOT THE SAME FOR EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL -- IF YOU HAVE A PASSPORT A PASS FOR CONSERVE APPROPRIATELY THERE IS THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER -- WE FIND THE PEOPLE GET CONFUSED ABOUT THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SOME DON'T HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY CARD ANYMORE. AND NOT ALL OF YOUR WAGE DOCUMENTS CONTAIN THE FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SO IT'S REALLY BEING CLEAR THAT YOU LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTS YOU'RE PRESENTING. AND THEN IF YOU HAD SOME NAME CHANGES OVER THE YEARS. YOU HAVE TO BRING IN THOSE DOCUMENTS TO SHOW YOUR NAME CHANGES SO WE ACTUALLY REQUIRE EVERYBODY TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR YOU. BASED ON YOUR LIFE AND YOUR NAME YOUR NAME CHANGES AND THE DOCUMENTS YOU HAVE AVAILABLE TO BRING IN. THE I THINK WHAT WE'RE HOPING IS WITH THE MARKETING CAMPAIGN IS WILL SIMPLIFY THAT IF YOU GO TO AIRPORTS RIGHT NOW YOU'LL SEE THERE'S SOME INITIAL. INFORMATION AVAILABLE THAT OUTLINES EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED TO BRING IN WITH YOU. BASED ON YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION -- I THINK THERE WAS ANOTHER QUESTION ON CHANGING THE RESIDENTS INFO YEAH THE CHANGE OF THE RESIDENCY -- SO. A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY -- D. A DMV HAD BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SENSE YOU KNOW. TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ACTUALLY FINALIZED ITS REGULATIONS FOR ALL OF THE STATE'S. WE OPTED TO PURSUE IN IN IN RECOGNIZING WE HAD TWENTY THREE POINT MILLION PEOPLE THAT WE NEED REAL ID WAS THERE A SIMPLIFIED PROCESS THAT WE COULD EXERCISE. WE SAW THAT THE STATE OF WISCONSIN HAD ACTUALLY SELECTED A SINGLE RESIDENCY DOCUMENT -- IN ADDITION TO THE ALL OF THE OTHER DOCUMENTS WE THOUGHT THAT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE THE SAME PATH. SO WE DID THAT -- AND SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLY ASKED TO BRING IN ONE RESIDENCY DOCUMENT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED OUT IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE THEN HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE THAT IT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE EVERYBODY BRING IN. TWO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS SO THEN WE WENT ABOUT WITH THE RECODING AND REPROCESSING EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO DO -- THAT AS OF APRIL TWENTY NINTH AND GOING FORWARD WE ARE ACCEPTING TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS I WILL SAY BETWEEN JANUARY AND APRIL TWENTY NINTH WE'VE HAD. A NUMBER OF FOLKS ALREADY BRING IN THEIR SECOND RESIDENCY% DOCUMENT THERE WAS A QUESTION OF HOW WOULD WE REACH OUT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. WHO I REFER TO AS OUR EARLY ADOPTERS WHO CAME IN AHEAD OF TIME TO GET THE REAL ID? AND SO WE HAVE ABOUT THREE POINT ONE THREE POINT TWO MILLION OF THOSE WHO HAVEN'T -- PROVIDE AS A SECOND ROSY DOCUMENT OUR GOAL IS WE CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY ALL THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND SENDING MAILER OUT TO THEM. AND THE MAILER ITSELF WILL CONSTITUTE A STATE DOCUMENT THAT THEY CAN THEN BASICALLY CHECK AND SIGN OFF VERIFYING THAT THIS IS THE INDIVIDUAL STILL THEY HAVEN'T MOVED IF THEY'VE MOVED. WILL HAVE TO ACTUALLY PURSUE A DIFFERENT PATH WITH THEM BUT IF THEY HAVE NOT MOVED THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAIL THAT DOCUMENT BACK TO US. AND WE WILL CLUE POSTAGE FREE ENVELOPES FOR THEM OR WE'RE LOOKING AT ALSO HAVING THEM DROP IT OFF -- AT A DMV OFFICE MY GOAL IN THIS EXERCISE IS TO NOT HAVING COME BACK TO A DMV OFFICE. I DON'T NEED THAT FOOT TRAFFIC COMING IN I WANT TO SIMPLIFY THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE RESIDENT ARGUMENTS THAT QUALIFIES IS A STATE ISSUE DOCUMENT. SO WE BELIEVE THAT OUR DMV STATE ISSUE DOCUMENT QUALIFIES FOR THAT STATE ISSUE DOCUMENT. AND IS THE SIMPLEST WAY WE CAN HANDLE THAT. WE ARE WORKING ALL THE THE THE DATA PULL DOWN SO OUR GOAL IS PROBABLY THIS SUMMER EARLY THIS SUMMER I THINK THE GOAL IS. TO SEND OUT OUR MAILING TO ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS NOW THE GOOD NEWS FOR FOLKS -- I THINK SOMEBODY ASKED IN TWO YEARS WILL THEY HAVE A FEDERALLY NON COMPLIANT CARD. THE DMV IN ITS LETTER -- TO GOVERNOR NEWSOME -- BASICALLY OUTLINED THE FACT THAT WE WOULD HAVE THROUGH THE RENEWAL CYCLE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL SO THEY MAY HAVE FIVE PLUS YEARS FROM A RENEWAL CYCLE DEPENDING ON IT. TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THEIR SECOND RAZZIE DOCUMENT OF COURSE IF THEY WANT TO COME IN AND HAVE THE RENEWAL CYCLE WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE END OF THEIR SECOND RESIDENT DOCUMENT. ONE OF THESE WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IS WHEN WE GET TO INDIVIDUALS RENEWAL CYCLE HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE. THAT THEY ARE ON NOTICE THAT WE-DON'T HAVE THEIR SECOND RESIDENCY DOCUMENT OUR THOUGHT IS MUCH LIKE WE DO SMALL TESTS OR OTHER THINGS. IS MAKE SURE WHEN THAT RENEWAL NOTICES GOING OUT IS CLEARLY SIGNALS THAT A SECOND ROSY DOCUMENTS STILL REQUIRED FOR THEM SO THAT THEY CAN STILL HAVE. THEIR FEDERICA POINT CARD SO WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THOSE PROCESSES. I SEEM TO RECALL FOLKS ASKING MORE THAN JUST TO FOLLOW QUITE YES DOES THE NOTE YOU HAVE MY HOPE MEMBERS AND REMEMBER THAT IT. WAS ANOTHER QUESTIONS RELATED -- TO BUT IT'S BEEN PROGRAM AND SO THE DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE A SENIOR OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM AS WELL AND SO WE INTERACT WITH WITH THE THE THE SENIOR COMMUNITIES THROUGH THAT PROCESS. AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER QUESTION AS RELATES TO WHAT SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS AND AND THE ACTING DIRECTOR HAD MENTIONED -- PRIMARILY -- FOR MAJORITY THE CUSTOMER THE DOCUMENTS FOR REAL ID ARE -- TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS A MUSCLE SECURITY NUMBER WHETHER EITHER BUSINESS CREDIT CARD OR W. TO THE HAS THE FULL NUMBER ON IT. I'M ALONG WITH IDENTITY DOCUMENT AND THEN THAT IF YOU HAVE A AND A NAME CHANGE HAS MENTIONED -- JUST THE MAPPING ASSOCIATED WITH THAT NAME CHANGE. THING I'D I WANT TO ADD ON IS THE ACTING DIRECTOR HAD MENTIONED ABOUT THE SINGLE -- RESIDENTS ARE ACCURATE THAT WE WENT FORWARD WITH THAT WASN'T APPROVED PROCESS BY HOMELAND SECURITY -- IT WASN'T IN REGARDS TO WHAT'S GOING FORWARD WITH THAT JUST BECAUSE WISCONSIN HAD DONE IT WISCONSIN WAS BEING COMPLY WITH REAL ID WE ENGAGED HOMELAND SECURITY THAT WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE THAT SAME PROCESS. AND AND SO THEY HAD IDENTIFIED SO THAT THAT WAS OKAY AT THAT TIME. SO SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY CARD BUT THEY KNOW THEIR NUMBER IS THAT ADEQUATE ARE YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT PRINTED ON SOMETHING IT PHYSICALLY HAVE TO BE ON A DOCUMENT. FOR A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT THE FULL NUMBER NOT JUST THE LAST FOUR DIGITS AND THAT'S A GREAT POINT THAT WAS ANOTHER THING THAT WE ACTUALLY TRIED TO PUSH BACK ON EARLY ON AS AN EARLY I'M FOR REAL ID. IS THAT WE ACTUALLYDO ELECTRONIC VERIFICATION OF SOUL STURDY NUMBERS THROUGH THE SUBSTRATE ADMINISTRATION AND WE TRY TO BOMB. A SEPARATE BACK BUT ENGAGE WITH HOMELAND SECURITY AND SAY THIS IS THE PROCESS WE DO TODAY WHY DO WE NEED TO BRING IN A PHYSICAL DOCUMENT. THEY HAD SAID IT WAS A REQUIREMENT THE REGULATIONS AND THEY WERE NOT GOING TO CHANGE IT. SENATOR A THING MENSURAL I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THOSE WHO HAS A REAL ID WITH. ONE RESIDENTS VERIFICATION DOCUMENT. SO IT EXACTLY HOW TO Y.. WELL I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW YET BUT I'D I WOULD HOPE THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE DMV AND DROP OFF A DOCUMENT I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE A WAY TO AYE THE MAIL TO YOU. OR UPLOAD IT SOMEHOW TO YOU. SO YOU COULD HAVE IT IN YOUR FILE -- AND HAVE ME AVOID THE APPOINTMENT PROCESS NOT THAT IT WAS PAINFUL I WENT TO MY LOCAL OFFICE AND IT WAS JUST FINE -- BUT WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL HAVE THAT PROCESS NAIL DOWN SO I DON'T. FORGET AND WAIT TO MY RENEWAL -- SO AGAIN -- WE THE GOAL IS AND SOME LETTERS OUT EARLY THIS SUMMER TO ALL THOSE THAT ACTUALLY HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH. THE REAL ID PROCESS AND HAVE A SINGLE RESIDENCY DOCUMENT THAT THEY PROVIDE AND AGAIN OUR PREFERENCES THAT WE'RE GONNA SEND A STATE ISSUED DOCUMENT WHICH WILL SERVE AS CONFIRMATION OF YOUR RESIDENCE CAM. AND WITH THE POSTAGE RETURN ENVELOPE THAT YOU CAN DROP IN THE MAIL BACK TO US THAT WOULD BE OUR PREFERENCE. WELL WE ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF UPLOADING I THINK THAT GETS TO THE HEART OF THE WORK THAT IT CREATES BACK IN OUR OFFICES WITH OURS THE SCANNING AND AND TRANSACTING THAT THROUGH OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN POINTED OUT -- NEED SOME HELP -- WE HAVE AN AGING INFRASTRUCTURE FROM A TECHNOLOGY STANDPOINT. AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS I MORE READILY HANDLE THE TRANSACTION OF SCAN YOUR DOCUMENT MAKING SURE IT'S US ASIDE WITH YOUR DOCUMENTS YOUR PROFILE -- AND THAT WOULD BE THE EASIEST I THINK MOST EFFICIENT WAY FOR US TO HANDLE IT WE THOUGHT FOR SOME FOLKS THEY MAY WANT TO DROP IT OFF BUT I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY OUR PREFERENCE ORGAN INSTRUCT FOCUSES WE'D PREFER. TO GO AND HAVE YOU MAIL IT BACK TO US AND THEN WE'LL GO AHEAD AND RECORDED ACCORDINGLY. AND THEN THE OTHER THING WE'RE LOOKING AT AS CONFIRMATION WHAT WOULD BE THAT CONFIRMATION LET YOU KNOW THAT WE FOR SAVED IN THE U. OF I'M I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED AGAIN. WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE REAL ID PROCESS -- I DIDN'T I DON'T REMEMBER DO YOU SCAN THE DOCUMENTS THAT I BROUGHT TO THE DISTRICT OFFICE AND KEEP THEM IN THE SYSTEM SO YOU'RE REQUIRED TO KEEP THE THE RESIDENTS AND IDENTITY DOCUMENTS IN YOUR SYSTEM SOMEHOW CORRECT SO IF I MAIL A THE PROPERTY TAX STATEMENT THAT HAS MY AS RESIDENTS. ON AT MY ADDRESS AND MY NAME YOU WOULD HAVE TO SCAN THAT INTO YOUR SYSTEM CORRECT AND THEN PRESUMABLY DESTROY THE ORIGINAL SO YOU'RE NOT KEEPING OR OR SEND IT BACK TO ME. I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT ENTIRE PROCESS CORRECT. BECAUSE WERE GIVEN OUR DOCUMENTS BACK WHEN WE LEAVE THE D. LOCAL DMV OFFICE OKAY ENOUGH ON THAT NAME CHANGES SO I JUST WENT THROUGH THIS. FOR MY SPOUSE THIS WEEKEND AND THE CHECKLIST WORKS FINE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ACCESS. TO THE WEBSITE AND IN A COMPUTER AND I WENT THROUGH THE CHECKLIST. NOW. SHE OBVIOUSLY HAD A DIFFERENT NAME BEFORE SHE MARRIED ME ARE ARE YOU REQUIRED TO WASN'T CLEAR TO ME FROM THE CHECKLIST ARE YOU REQUIRED TO BRING. DOCUMENTS TO THE DMV -- OFFICE REFLECTING YOUR MAIDEN NAME. AS WELL AS YOU WERE MARRIED NAME. IS THAT THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. THAT'S GOOD NEWS BECAUSE I WILL LET HER KNOW BEFORE SHE GETS THERE ON FRIDAY. YES THANK YOU AND IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ON THAT. IF SHE WERE NOT THE BRILLIANT WOMAN I KNOW SHE TO BE AN LET'S SAY SHE DIVORCED SENATOR OFTEN AND ANOTHER GENTLEMAN. SHE WOULD THEN BE REQUIRED TO BRING IN PROOF OF MADE NAY. HER MARRIAGE LICENSE SHOWING HER. MARRIAGE THE SENATOR ROBB. HER DIVORCE DECREE SHOW AND SEPARATION AND THE HER MARRIAGE LICENSE TO NEWT SET HAS BEEN. IF THEY ALL INVOLVE NAME CHANGES FOR HER YES. TRAGIC DEATH SOME. MORE LOG BOMB YOU HAD A QUESTION I THINK THAT THE SECRETARY SUGGESTED IT WILL BE MORE PROPERLY DRECTED -- TO THE ACTING DIRECTOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO POSE THAT NOW. SURE I'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON BUSINESS PLANS STRATEGIC PLANS WORK FLOW. PLANS. I KNOW YOU'RE NEW TO THE POSITION OR I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW LONG YOU BEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- THE WHAT'S WHAT'S OCCURRING. IN THAT REGARD. SO I HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE FEBRUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR -- AND HAVE BEEN ON A FAST PACED LEARNING CURVE BUT WHAT I WILL TELL YOU. IS THAT -- THE DMV DOES HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN IT WAS DONE BY THE PRIOR DIRECTOR IT IS A FIVE YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN. AND THAT WE DO ACTUALLY HAVE THE THIS IS PLANTS THAT ACTUALLY FALL OUT OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN WHICH YOU WOULD NORMALLY WOULD HAVE BECAUSE THAT GETS INTO YOUR TACTICAL APPLICATION OF YOUR STRATEGIC GOALS. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I OF TASK MY ENTERPRISE GOVERNANCE COUNCIL WHO ACTUALLY IS INVOLVED WITH THE STRATEGIC PLANNING. PROCESS MANAGEMENT COMPONENT IS THAT EVERYTHING I SHARED WITH YOU EARLIER ABOUT OUR WORK PLAN. OUR BUSINESS PLAN WORK PLAN IS ALL GOING TO BE INTEGRATED INTO OUR STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS PLANS. SO THAT WE IS A GROUP ON A MONTHLY BASIS ARE REVIEWING OUR PROGRESS AND ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND CREATE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AMONGST OURSELVES -- THAT ALSO BECOMES A REPORT THAT I CAN CERTAINLY SHARE WITH THE CAL COVERING TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. AND ANY OTHER ANY OTHER PARTY THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THOSE PROGRESS REPORT SO. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US WORKFORCE PLANNING IS ALSO ANOTHER IMPORTANT AREA I JUST. RECENTLY SIGNED OFF ON DMV'S WORKFORCE PLAN IT'S A VERY HIGH LEVEL DOCUMENT. I NEED TO GET INTO FURTHER DETAILS ONE OF THE TASKS THAT I AM WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. IS OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVON DIVISION I AM ACTUALLY BRINGING IN SOMEBODY TO DO A WORK FORCE ASSESSMENT OF THAT TEAM BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HIRING. THE RIGHT SKILL SETS AND CAPABILITIES INTO THAT OPERATION SO THAT WE CAN BECOME THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY ARM FOR THE DMV. SO THAT SOMETHING WERE ENGAGE WITH BECAUSE I REALLY NEED MAKE SURE AS WE'RE GOING OUT TO RECRUIT AND HIRE IT IS THE RIGHT SKILLS THAT WERE BRINGING INTO THE ORGANIZATION. AND MAYBE FOR MISTER CROCKETT SINCE I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE DMB FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS -- THE LEGISLATURE SEEMS TO BE ADDING [inaudible] WORKLOAD. ON ITS OWN MOTOR VOTER. DECALS FOR CARS IN THE CARPOOL LANE CONSIDERED CENTER -- HAVE YOU BEEN ACCOMMODATING THAT IN HIS -- POINT WHERE YOU SAY WAIT A SECOND WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO SOMEHOW MAKE THIS FIT IN OUR BUSINESS PLAN. THIS WHOLE MOTOR VOTER IMPLEMENTATION YOU KNOW EVERYONE WAS WARNED THAT WASN'T GOING TO WORK. IN APRIL AND AND AND A WIN ANYWAY. SO HOT HOW DO YOU. PROVIDE SOME COUNSELING PUSH BACK TO MAKE SURE THINGS ARE BEING DONE AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH THE RIGHT SOFTWARE AND RIGHT [inaudible] STEPHANIE. CORRECT IN ITS IN ITS A CHALLENGE AT THE END OF THE BALANCING ACT OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEFORE IT IS IS REALLY GOOD -- LEGISLATION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND ALL YOUR ANSWERS CONSTITUENTS I THINK THE THE CHALLENGE THAT WE DO END UP -- ENCOUNTERING SOMETIMES IS A LOT OF LEGISLATION REQUIRES SOME CODING. AND SO WHEN YOU START TO HAVE I HAVE ALL THE DIFFERENT CODING THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO DO IT BECOMES A DOMINO EFFECT IN REGARDS TO HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE THE CODING. AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE RUN INTO IS A LOT OF TIMES -- BECAUSE OF THE THE BENEFICIAL NATURE OF THE LEGISLATION. THAT HS -- IMPLEMENTATION DATES THAT ARE EITHER COMING UP YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS FROM THE FROM PASSAGE OR A LOT OF TIMES ARE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE TRIES TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH. THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICES FOR DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATES I THINK THE BIGGEST THING OF BENEFIT FOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE. IN REGARD TO THAT IS GOING BACK TO THE COMMUNICATION IT'S MORE THAN JUST COMMUNICATION EVEN ON THIS STUFF IT'S COMMUNICATION ON ON BILLS THAT THAT ARE IMPORTANT -- TO YOU GUYS AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS AS IT RELATES TO LET'S MAKING SURE THAT I'M THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO IMPLEMENT. I THINK IT DOES A MANAGER THANK YOU THANK YOU FACT FOLLOW UP ON THAT HOW ARE YOU BALANCING THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF REALIZE DE. WHICH WEEK WE CAN SEE THAT HEADLIGHT COMING RIGHT AT US WHAT THE THE KINDS OF LONG TERM MANAGEMENT REFORMS THAT ARE NEEDED THAT WE HEARD VERY CLEARLY ARTICULATED AS A RESULT OF THE AUDIT. YOU KNOW COURT CUSTOMER SERVICE FUNCTION FUNCTIONS LIKE TRAINING SO HOW ARE YOU [inaudible] BALANCING. SO GREAT QUESTION -- AND ANYONE INNINGS I WOULD SAY THAT I HAVE -- LEARNED AND BEING THERE I'M IN AND I AGREE WITH THE FINDINGS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SAY. IS SOME SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE CHALLENGE WITH A RELEASE OF SAY WITH THIS SYSTEMIC ISSUES AT THE DMV AS YOU'VE POINTED OUT. HOWEVER -- WE ALSO KNOW WE HAVE AN IMMEDIATE NEED WE HAVE TO ADDRESS WITH RELATING. SO I WOULD SAY ONE WE'RE ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT -- BRINGING IN PEOPLE BUT BRINGING IN PEOPLE IS NEVER A LONG TERM ANSWER. BRINGING IN PEOPLE'S ADDRESSING A SHORT TERM DEMAND THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE FACING OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT TWO YEARS. I ANTICIPATE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THE OCTOBER ONE TWENTY TWENTY TIME FRAME WILL PROBABLY ACTUALLY HAVE A TAIL AFTER THAT. BECAUSE THEY'LL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND SAY. YOU KNOW MAYBE I NEED TO GET THAT REAL ID I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY PASSPORT WITH ME ALL THE TIME. SO I WOULD SAY GOING TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL HAVE A LOT OF ACTIVITY -- BUT I WHERE I'M FOCUSED AND I'VE ALWAYS KIND OF TAKEN THIS APPROACH EVEN SERVING IN THE GULF OFFICE AGENCIES THE DIRECTOR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ORGANIZATION AS TO WHAT I CALL THE THREE LEAVES THE STORE. THE WORK FORCE IN THE WORK FORCE HAS TO GO THROUGH TREES REMOTE TRANSFORMATION BUSINESS PROCESSES WE HAVE MANY BUSINESS LINES IN FACT I WOULD SAY OF ALL THE DEPARTMENTS I'VE HAD TO WORK WITH THE DMV IS. YOU KNOW MOST LIKE A RETAIL OUTLET IN THAT IT SO HOUSE MANY PRODUCT LINES THAT IT SERVES. AND WE HAVE TO DO A BUSINESS PROCESS ASSESSMENT REALLY AROUND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PRODUCT LINES WHETHER IT'S MOTOR CARRIER PERMITS DRIVER'S LICENSE. MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS TILING ALL OF THEM WE NEED A DIVE INTO A LOOK AT THOSE BUSINESS PROCESSES AND THEN THERE'S TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMATION -- I THINK WHAT I LOOK WHEN I SEE DMV I SEE AN ORGANIZATION THAT WE HAVE DONE -- DEFERRED MODERNIZATION OF DMV FOR MANY YEARS I MEAN WHEN I SEE THAT WE ARE RUNNING A SIMILAR CODE WHICH IS SO OUTDATED IT'S EVEN BEFORE COLD ALL CODE AND WE HAVE CALL BOB CODE -- AND I LOOK AT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE NOT NIMBLE WE ARE NOT AND CHILD. AND WE AND WE DO A CODE CHANGE IT TAKES SOMETIMES MONTHS TO DO GO THROUGH THE TESTING ENVIRONMENT BUT WE'RE OFTENTIMES GIVEN A VERY SHORT DURATION TO BRING SOMETHING UP WHICH MEANS WE WILL HAVE PROBLEMS THERE WILL BE SOME. GLITCHES IN THE SYSTEM -- BUT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU BECAUSE THIS CAME UP. EARLIER TO QUESTIONS HOW DO WE COMPARE WITH ALL THE OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY THAT ARE HANDLING THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS I BECOME FAMILIAR WITH AND THEY ARE A GREAT RESOURCE TO US INTO ALL OUR NEIGHBORING STATES. IS THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF MOTOR VEHICLE DMINISTRATORS. IT IS ACTUALLY A GROUP OF FOLKS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT DO MOTOR VEHICLE OR DRIVER'S LICENSE ADMINISTRATION. AND WHAT I FIND FASCINATING IS A COUPLE YEARS AGO THEY ISSUED A LARGE BUSINESS PLAN AROUND TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FOR ALL DMV'S. IF YOU ACTUALLY DO ANY KIND OF GOOGLE SEARCH YOU'LL FIND A NUMBER OF OUR STATES THAT ARE EMBARKING UPON TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FOR THEIR DIEM -- I WOULD ALSO TELL YOU THERE IS THE ISSUE AROUND. THE REPUTATION OF MOTOR VEHICLE ORGANIZATIONS THEY'VE JUST ISSUED ANOTHER PAPER GUIDING MOTOR VEHICLE ORGANIZATIONS ON HOW TO BUILD REPUTATIONS. IN THEIR STATES -- ANOTHER REALLY INTERESTING -- ONE IS WITH THE CARDS TO JUST I I THINK RE IMAGINING THE DMV FOR EVERY STATE. I THINK WE REALLY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN I ALMOST A BORDERLINE NINETEENTH CENTURY MODEL OF DOING BUSINESS. MY MANTRA WITH STAFF IS THAT THIS JOURNEY IS ABOUT US MOVING FROM OUR GRANDPARENTS DMV TO OUR CHILDREN'S DMV. AND I THINK SOMEBODY ALLUDE TO THE FACT THE DMV IS REALLY BLESSED WITH A LOT OF VERY CARING AND PASSIONATE EMPLOYEES. IN MY JOB AND MY ACTING ROLE HERE IS TO MAKE SURE I GIVE THEM THE TOOLS. AND THE TRAINING TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEY CAN BE IN THIS MODERN AGE OF DELIVERING ON OUR MISSION. I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT I FIND INTERESTING IS IF YOU GOOGLE EVERY STATE IN THE NATION IS FACING ISSUES AROUND REAL IDEA PROCESSING TIME I SAW AN ARTICLE. RECENTLY IN TEXAS THE WHERE THEY WERE ENCOUNTERING FOR A FIVE HOUR WAITS -- I KNOW THAT THE STATE OF KENTUCKY RECENTLY IS DELAYING THEIR ACTIVITY BECAUSE OF SOME SYSTEM ISSUES -- SO IT GOES ON AND ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS. THIS CHALLENGE BUT I WILL TELL YOU IT'S A GREAT ENVIRONMENT FOR BEST PRACTICES SHARING A SECRETARY BACHELOR REYES INDEED ANNA'S DOING SOME REALLY INTERESTING WORK -- NEW YORK HAS DONE SOME INTERESTING WORK -- AND SO WE TRY TO LEARN FROM OTHER STATES AND SAY WHAT WOULD BE APPLICABLE AT THE SCALE WE NEED TO DO IT HERE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO IT'S A GREAT RESOURCE FOR US AND CERTAINLY FOR YOUR STAFF -- ENCOURAGED HIM TO LOOK AT THE WEBSITE BECAUSE THERE'S SOME GREAT INFORMATION OUT THERE AS WELL. I THANK YOU I'M GOING TO ASK -- I KNOW CENTER LEYVA WHO'S NOT HERE ASK A QUESTION I'M JUST GOING TO ASK STAFF IF YOU FOLLOW IT WITH WITH WITH HER OFFICE WITH REGARD -- TO THE FIRST SLIDER TO IN THE ALLEY -- WAS PRESENTATION IT TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF HE WOULD YOU KNOW YOU KNOW HOW LONG HOW YOU WERE DEFINING TEMPERS OF WE CAN CIRCLE BACK WITH HER -- IT'S CLEAR -- YOU'VE BEEN CLEAR AS HAVE OTHERS ABOUT THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ALL. WITH THAT OUR LACK OF ACTION ON THE APRIL LETTERS IN THE GLBT REQUEST WOULD HAVE I APPRECIATE HEARING. THAT THEY PLAN IS PUT IN PLACE THAT WILL INCLUDE METRICS BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WILL BE MOST HELPFUL FOR US IS UNDERSTANDING THE AFFIRMATIVE OUTCOMES OF THE INVESTMENT. AND SO I'M CERTAINLY HOPING THAT THAT DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US PRIOR TO AN ULTIMATE BUDGET VOTE -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT WILL HELP INFORM AND GIVE ALL MY COLLEAGUES A SENSE OF EASE. MORE OF A SENSE OF EIGHTIES -- AS WE EMBARK ON TRULY STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE -- AND ACKNOWLEDGING -- WE HAVE COME TO THIS POINT IN TIME INDIAN THESE HISTORY AS A RESULT OF A LONG TERM LACK OF INVESTMENT OR PERHAPS APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT. AND SO HOPEFULLY -- THOSE METRICS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US -- TO HELP US MAKE THAT DECISION -- WE'LL MOVE ON TO DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THE MANAGER MEMBERS AMANDA MARTIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE INTERESTS OF KEEPING THE TRAIN MOVING I WILL BE VERY BRIEF AND BUDGET FOCUSED IN MY COMMENTS -- BY WAY OF BACKGROUND PAGE SIX OF YOUR AGENDA DOES LAY OUT THE FUNDING HISTORY OF REQUESTS FOR APPROPRIATIONS THE FIRST FOUR ROWS ON THAT PAGE HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PROPOSAL WAS ORIGINALLY A FIVE YEAR PROPOSAL BUT GIVEN THAT REAL ID WAS JUST STARTING THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE FIRST TWO YEARS WITH THE ANTICIPATION OF COURSE THAT WE WILL BE BACK IN. NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW -- THE BY THE ADMINISTRATION SUBMITTED AN ADDITIONAL REQUESTS ON JANUARY THIRD BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH PLEDGE STAFF DEPARTMENTS COMMITTED TO EXTEND THE JAIL B. C. REVIEW PERIOD -- AND TO NOT APPROVE THE AUGMENTATION UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE COULD HOLD A HEARING ON THE MORE PRIDE ISSUES AGAIN MY WERE HERE TODAY. YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM -- SAYING THE STRIKE TEAM AN ACTING DIRECTOR WEB IS GIVING YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR SPRING FINANCE LETTER -- BUT IS THIS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO MAKE ONE CLARIFICATION ON THE NUMBERS. ON THE AGENDA NOTES THE PROPOSAL AT FOUR HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION -- ACTING DIRECTOR CITED TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION BOTH ARE CORRECT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO NUMBERS IS -- THE PROPOSED REDUCTION OF NON MBA FUNDS TO REFLECT THE PASSING THROUGH A CREDIT CARD CHARGES SO THAT IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO NUMBERS. I ALSO NOTE THAT THE BUDGET AFTER TWENTY EIGHTEEN REQUIRES THE DMV TO SUBMIT MONTHLY WAIT TIME REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED ALL THE WAY THROUGH. AND HE USED TO MAKE THEM THROUGH AT LEAST DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS AFTER THE OCTOBER ONE TWENTY POINT. EIGHT FUND THESE REPORTS INCLUDE NOT ONLY ARE WAIT TIMES BUT ALSO THEIR PROGRESS ON HIRING OF POSITIONS AND SO THOSE ARE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE MONTHLY AS ONE OF OUR COMMUNICATION TOOLS -- BUT WE HAD WELL AS THE INCREASING PERCENTAGE OF REALIZED THE TRANSACTION SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE INFORMED THROUGH THIS MECHANISM AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON A CRAFT [inaudible] QUESTIONS. THE BILL. OF THIS. MOTOR VEHICLE COUNTY -- WHEN I LOOKED AT THE REPORTER THINK IT'S SO? PAGE ZERO WORLD PAGE SEVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FULL FINANCE LETTER. IS A MOBILE YOU'RE -- REQUESTS CORRECT -- TOOLS SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. OF ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS -- I THINK. WHAT THE QUESTION WOULD BE IS -- THE MOTOR VEHICLE CAL IS STRUCTURALLY UNBALANCED. COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM OR ISSUE OR WHAT WAS THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT GONNA LOOK LIKE. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WITH THIS EXTRA. MONEY THAT'S GOING TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT. IS IT GOING TO REQUIRE -- FEE INCREASES AND OTHER KINDS OF REVENUE THAT -- WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT SO CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. CERTAINLY SAYS AS PART IN THE PETITION -- ACTUALLY WITH OUR SPRING FINANCE LETTER WE PROVIDED WHICH WE DON'T NORMALLY DO BUT WE DID PROVIDE AN UPDATED -- MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT FUND CONDITION STATEMENT THAT REFLECTS THE INCREASED EXPENDITURES -- IF YOU LOOK AT THAT WE WILL BE UPDATING THE REVENUES THAT'S PART OF THE MAY REVISION BUT JUST LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW. THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT DOES DIPPED TO A LOW OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION IN RESERVE AND I BELIEVE IT'S BUT YEAR PLUS. TWO BUT WE HAVE ADJUSTED I WITHIN THIS BY PASSING THROUGH. A TRANSFER OF ALMOST NINETY MILLION A YEAR THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN TO THE GENERAL FUND WE SUSPENDED THAT TRANSFER SO ABOUT MONEY REMAINS IN THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT -- VAT TRANSFER IS NOT WHAT WE CALL NON ARTICLE NINETEENTH NOT. COMING FROM -- CAR JUST RATIONS IT'S IT IS A THAT'S WHY I HAVE BEEN IN PAST PASSED THROUGH. TO THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT'S BEING SUSPENDED WE HAVE ALSO DELAYED SOME CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT AND PROPOSED SWITCHING SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS FROM -- CASH FUNDED MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT -- TO PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FUND TO CONTINUE THOSE PROJECT PROJECTS THAT FOR WHICH ARE ARE FAR DOWN THE ROAD AND SO WE HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL. EFFORTS TO ALLOW THE MEDICAL MOTOR VEHICLE COUNTY REMAIN SOLVENT AND FROM THIS PROPOSAL. GO ON WITHOUT A FEE INCREASE THANK YOU SO THE THESE -- THE MOTOR VEHICLE CAO FUNDS THE HIGHER CONTROL CORRECT. THEY ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST SO WHAT WOULD THE THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT BY HAVING MORE REQUIREMENTS ON IT. FROM -- DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES -- I WAS SO IT HAS LESS. FUNDS THAT WILL BE FLEXIBLE. THERE -- FOR IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTED. TO FUND -- HIGHER PATROL INCREASES OR BASED ON THE POPULATION. YOU KNOW INCREASES IN CALIFORNIA -- YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW AND SO FORTH BECAUSE THAT'S NORMALLY WHAT YOU WANT TO LOOK AT HIGHER CONTROL AS SOON. IT'S LIKE YOU WANT TO INCREASE IT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DRIVERS YOU HAVE OUT THERE THE NUMBER OF OF THE POPULATION OF THE STATE -- THINGS LIKE YOUR ACCIDENT RATES. TRYING TO REDUCE SAFETY. SO SO I'M KIND OF WONDERING HOW IT IS -- SPENDING IN THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNTY -- AFFECT THE HIGHWAY PATROL. BUDGET OVER THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD. SO WE LOOK AT ALL DEPARTMENTS BUDGETS EACH YEAR -- AS I SAID DURING ON YOUR CURRENT FORECASTS THE NBA WOULD DROP TO A LOW OF A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION SO IF YOU WANTED TO FOR INCREASED. EXPENDITURES BEYOND THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED. THUS FAR FOR THE HIGHWAY PATROL -- YOU WOULD EITHER BE DIPPING INTO THAT RESERVE OR YOU WOULD HAVE TO ADJUST OTHER EXPENDITURES OR REVENUE SOURCES FOR THE ONE FIFTY FIVE RESERVE. IS OVER A LIKE -- FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR FUND. THAT'S ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION. OF RESERVES ON A FOR HALF BILLION DOLLARS MOTOR VEHICLE FUND RIGHT. PRACTICE LESS IT IS. LESS A SADDLE VERY SMALL RESERVE YES. WE LIKE 55% RESERVE WHICH WOULD BE CLOSER TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION HOWEVER THE CHP AND DMV HISTORICALLY HAVE MANAGED. ON AS LOW AS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR RESERVE WE WOULD PREFER OBVIOUSLY HIGHER RESERVE BUT IN ORDER TO FIND ALL OF THE THE NEEDS WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR SPEECH BE SOME -- ONE TIME FUNDING WITH GENERAL FUND GIVEN THE CRITICALITY OF C. H. P.'S -- NEEDS AS WELL AS THE CONDITION OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT. OKAY DID YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT THE FEE INCREASES OVER THE FIVE YEARS. OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL DOES NOT REQUIRE A FEE INCREASE OVER THE LISTING OF FEEDING CREWS ARE NOT. NOT THE SURE IN THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD. BASED ON OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS THAT WOULD NOT BE NEEDED THANK YOU. ALL LET'S MOVE ON TO HEAR FROM THE SENATE BILL SO I'M SORRY. IF I MAY. IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE DISTURBING. TO SEE THE DEFERRAL OF THESE MONIES THAT HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED AWAY. AND NOW WHAT YOU'RE ASKING THE ADDITIONAL NOT COULD NOT BE JUST. TO APPROPRIATIONS OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. THE MONEY'S THERE DEFERRED AWAY MEAN THE MONIES FOR THE WE'RE NOT WE'RE GONNA NOT. GONNA. PAY WITH A FIVE YEAR KIND OF HEY HIATUSES. WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING? FROM THE FROM THE REPAYMENT OF THE YES FOR FUNDS OKAY IT'S A GOOD NEWS THAT. WERE TRAINED PAYING ATTENTION TO BRING IT BACK BUT IT'S VERY BAD NEWS IT WAS EVER DONE BUT THAT SAID [inaudible] THEN. ARE YOU CONTEMPLATING ADDITIONAL REVENUES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED GOING FORWARD. WE'RE GOING TO DERIVE THAT FROM THE GENERAL FUND. IN THE C. P. OR HOW DO YOU INTEND TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. SO OUR CURRENT PLAN -- DOES NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL -- GENERAL FUND TRANSFERS. INTO THE NBA IT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE A FEE INCREASE IT DOES NOT AT THE MOMENT ANTICIPATE. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOM A GENERAL FUND BEYOND WHAT IS. IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED OBVIOUSLY IT WILL BE A YEAR BY YEAR ASSESSMENT OF HAVE NEEDS GOING FORWARD THIS IS A FINE FAT. THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATUREMONITOR VERY CLOSELY EVERY YEAR -- BUT AT THIS POINT WE HAVE A SOLVENT MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT -- GOING. FOR IT AND WHAT IS THE ARE ARGUMENT FOR UTILIZING REVENUE BONDS FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY. BY THE PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FUND. HAS BEEN USED TO FUNDS -- CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS FOR MANY DIFFERENT ENTITIES IN THE STATE THAT THIS PART OF ITS PURPOSE THE THE ARGUMENT. THAT -- SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE ALREADY HAD -- THROUGH. THERE ARE WORKING DRAWINGS AND THEY'RE READY TO GO TO CONSTRUCTION -- FUNDING THEM WITH THE BILLING CONSTRUCTIN FUND WILL NOT ONLY ALLOW THEM TO GO FORWARD. BUT WELL THERE WILL BE SOME COST INCREASES THEY ARE OFFSET BY THE FACT THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING THEM NOW BECAUSE THERE'S OF COURSE THE GROWTH. ON WHEN YOU DELAY A PROJECT CONSTRUCTION COSTS GET GREATER AND SO -- OVER SEVERAL YEARS IT WOULD IT WOULD NOT OUT WHILE STILL ALLOWING THESE PROJECTS GO FORWARD. BUT IT IS IN A REVENUE BOND AND THAT COULD BE A GREATER EXPENSE THE STATE WOULD NOT. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE FOR THAT THE CONSTRUCTION PROCEEDS NOW THERE IS IN THE INCREASED COST OF DEBT SERVICE. BUT BACK. ABSOLUTELY 20% BUT IF YOU DELAY THAT SAME PROJECT BY FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND IT ON A CASH BASIS -- THAT AMOUNT GETS EATEN UP BY INFLATED CONSTRUCTION COSTS. OKAY THANK YOU I WAS GONNA IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION EARLIER SENATOR MORLOCK ABOUT HOW AS A SITTING MEMBER YOU CAN FEEL CONNECTED -- WE WANT -- THE ACTING DIRECTOR TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE TIME TO GIVE HER FULL ATTENTION -- TO STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS THE REPORT THAT HE'S DEVELOPING THE METRICS -- AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ALL OF US CALL AND SCHEDULE A MEET GREET WITH HER. BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE CITY MEMBER THE LEGISLATURE THAT THAT IS OUR OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW IN BETWEEN -- OFFICIAL HEARINGS LIKE THAT LIKE THIS THAT WHEN THERE ARE DEPARTMENTS THAT WE HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN BE IT BASED ON A COMMITTEES SERVE ON OR WHAT HAVE YOU OR CALLS WE GET FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS IT THAT. WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REACH OUT TO THE DEPARTMENTS AND IF IT'S NOT THE ACTING DIRECTOR THE APPROPRIATE PERSON SHE DESIGNATES IN A DEPARTMENT. TO COME IN ONE ON ONE AND GIVE US THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THE OPTION AVAILABLE TO US ALL. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE CITY MEMBERS AND WITH THE ACTING DIRECTING NOT IN -- I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT SHE AGREES. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SENATOR NIELSEN. WITH THE REAL ID AN IMPLEMENTATION. COULDN'T SOME OF THIS. DEFERRAL OF THE PAYMENT BACK. SHOULDN'T SOME OF THAT BE FAST FORWARDED AND USED. FOR THE REAL ID WHAT IS IT THEY HAVE TO BE STE. THIS. IT'S NOT FORGIVEN BUT SET ASIDE FOR SO LONG BUT IT'S NOT A DEFERRAL IF I'M AND THE SNOW THAT IF THE WELL IT FORMALLY. IT WAS. IT WAS A IT WAS BORROWED CORRECT. WHO IS THE STREET HELLO? OKAY I'M SO I WAS A TRANSFER. THERE'S AN ANNUAL THERE HAS BEEN SINCE NINE TEN THERE'S BEEN AN ANNUAL TRANSFERRED IN THE BUDGET ACT IT'S BASED ON THE PRIOR YOUR ACTUAL AMOUNTS THAT WERE COLLECTED BY DMV. AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO SUSPEND THAT SO IT WOULDN'T COME. AFTER THE FIVE YEARS WELL TAKE A LOOK AT IT BUT AT THIS POINT IT'S NOT A LOAN A REPAIRMAN IT'S A WE ARE NOT GOING TO TRANSFER THOSE MONIES OUT OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT INTO. THE GENERAL FUND. FOR FIVE YEARS. BUT THAT SPARES. ANY DRAW ON THE GENERAL FUND CORRECT [inaudible] BUT THAT GENERAL FUND MONEY IS NOT GOING TO BE JUST. IT'S GOING TO BE SPENT SOMEWHERE ELSE CORRECT. SO IN TERMS OF OVERALL BUDGET IMPACT. IT'S NOT BEEN ANY RELIEF FOR BENEFIT. SO WHAT IS THE RATIONALE. FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. HOW ARE YOU MAKING IT MORE EFFICIENT MORE EFFECTIVE LESS COSTLY? SEVEN IN ESSENCE A DEFINED SHIFT RATHER EVENT LIKE TO POINT YOU'RE SAYING IF WE DID NOT SUSPEND THE TRANSFER WE COULD FIND AT THIS PROPOSAL WITH GENERAL FUND ALTERNATIVELY WE SUSPEND THE TRANSFER. AND WE FIND IT WITHIN VA. THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE THANK YOU. THE SLEEP FROM LA I'LL -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A REFERENCE TO HER EARLIER -- WE HAVE PREPARED SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IF YOU TRY TO THE HANDOUT THAT WE DISTRIBUTED EARLIER WE'RE GONNA START ON PAGE SIX OF YOUR HAND OUT. IN TOTAL WE HAVE SEVEN ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN REALLY OUR PERSPECTIVE IN IDENTIFYING THESE IS TO HOLD THE LEGISLATURE THING THROUGH. THE THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE THEM AS WELL THINKING ABOUT ON AN ONGOING BASIS WHAT THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVELS SHOULD BE. THE FIRST ONE I'LL JUST GO OVER REALLY BRIEFLY BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF CLEAR OUT COMING PERFORMANCE MEASURES. BEING A TOOL FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENSURING THAT LEGISLATIVE EXPECTATIONS ARE MET. THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT THIS REQUEST IS BASED ON A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS -- FERRIS OPTIONS ON HOW INDIVIDUALS REACT TO THINGS LIKE THE REAL ID -- DEADLINE AS WELL AS THE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES AT THE DMV SEE IN SEEKING TO IMPLEMENT WE DON'T KNOW HOW INDIVIDUALS REACT IN THAT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT SO FOR EXAMPLE. ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WAS MENTIONED IS SOFTWARE TO VALIDATE SOME OF THIS DOCUMENTATION THAT WE WOULD BE PROVIDED FOR INDIVIDUALS GO IN. THAT ACTUALLY WRITTEN THAT IS A GREAT TOOL IF IT WORKS EFFECTIVELY AND AS INTENDED HOWEVER IT DOES ALSO REYES KIND OF PRIVACY CONCERNS IT'S UNCLEAR THE EXTENT TO WHICH INDIVIDUALS WILL BE COMFORTABLE. WITH SHARING THINGS LIKE THEIR AND NAME ORSOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER DATE OF BIRTH ELECTRONICALLY. OUR THIRD ISSUE FOR CONSIDERATION THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE IS THAT THE NET IMPACT OF ALL OF THE VARIOUS PROPOSED ACTIVITIES IS REALLY UNCLEAR. SO A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO SHIFT INDIVIDUALS OUT OF THE FIELD OFFICE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SHIFT IS APPROPRIATE. FOR A IS SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH I SHOULD SAY HE WILL THEN HAVE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY HANDLING THAT WORKLOAD THAT COULD BE REDIRECTED TO HANDLE REAL ID WORKLOAD. INTO THE NET IMPACT IS REALLY KIND OF UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE. SEVEN OUR FOURTH ISSUE IS -- THIS IS THIS ISSUE ABOUT SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM ACTIVITIES AND SO YOU HAVE THAT OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE AND SO. IN THINKING ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF THE DMV AND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT -- WE'VE HEARD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A WORK PLAN FOR THE LONG TERM THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD THING. TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE IS KIND OF MOVING FORWARD IN A DELIBERATE EVAN COMPREHENSIVE MANNER RATHER THAN DOING IT PIECEMEAL MANNER BECAUSE IF YOU MOVE FORWARD IN A PIECEMEAL MANNER YOU MIGHT END UP -- USING RESOURCES IN IT AND EFFECTIVE MANNER IN THE LONG RUN. THE FIFTH ISSUE THAT WE WANT TO RAISE YOUR ATTENTION IS THAT ALL OF THE VARIOUS PENDING EVALUATIONS -- THE PROTOTYPING AND THE PILOTS COULD REALLY VAN IMPACT THE MIX OVERALL LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED SO AN EASY EXAMPLE FOR THAT IS IF THE FIELD OFFICE EXPERIENCE OR JUST HOW THE FIELD OFFICES ARE CONSTRUCTED REALLY CHANGES. pLEVEL OF RESOURCES AND IT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME WHETHER WE'D BE REDIRECTING RESOURCES OR FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WOULD BE REQUESTED THROUGH THE PROVISIONAL PROCESS. THE SIXTH ISSUE TOWARDS THE BOTTOM IS THAT. THE EXISTING CHALLENGES WITH -- THE MOVE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND JUST SIMPLY CAPACITY ISSUES YOU HAVE SO MANY FIELD OFFICES COULD REALLY IMPACT HOW EFFECTIVELY THE REQUESTED RESOURCES ARE USED. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HEARD THE AUDIT RAISES THIS ISSUE ABOUT INEFFECTIVE -- ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES THERE'S A REQUEST FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND SO IT TO THE EXTENT WE DON'T KIND OF ADDRESS THAT IT MAY MEAN THAT WERE NOT USING THE REQUESTED RESOURCES IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER. TURNING TO THE FINAL PAGE WE CANNOT PAGE EIGHT THE LAST ISSUE FOR CONSIDERATION IS REALLY CONSIDERING THE ONGOING LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT THAT'S APPROPRIATE REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH FUNDING IS PROVIDED. TO YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF ASSUMPTIONS EVALUATIONS ETCETERA. THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER PROVIDING LIMITED TERM FUNDING THIS WOULD REQUIRE DMV TO COME BACK AND JUSTIFY HOW THE VIEWS THE REQUESTED RESOURCES THAT WERE PROVIDED. REASSESS THEIR PROCESS SEE IN THE MEANTIME AND THEN JUSTIFY ANY FUTURE REQUESTS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE CONDITION OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT -- BRIEFLY JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. A SECOND ISSUE HERE IS. THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE DOES PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. IT WITH ONE OF THE SECTION LETTERS BY THE TIME THE DEPARTMENT HAD SUBMITTED THE REQUEST AND THEY HAVE ACTUALLY ALREADY SPENT HALF OF ALMOST HALF OF THE FUNDING. AND IF YOU DO THAT THAT REALLY LIMITS JUST LEADERS ABILITY TO KIND OF EVALUATE THE CAUSES BEHIND THAT AND TAKE ALTERNATIVE ACTION IF NECESSARY AND SO ONE THING LEGISLATURE CONSIDER IS. REQUIRING THAT THE DEPARTMENT SEEK LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL BEFORE INCURRING ANY ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES. AND THEN OUR FINAL COMMENT HERE IS JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE REPORTING WOULD BE HELPFUL IT COULD BE THE WAIT TIME REPORT THAT WAS NOT WITH MENTION A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BUT IT CAN ALSO INCLUDE OTHER METRICS AND THAT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE OTHER CHANGES -- IN TERMS OF SHIFTING WORKLOAD OWL BUT ALSO GOVERNANCE CHANGES REDESIGNING FIELD OFFICES EXCITER AND SO. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP UP UPDATED AND ESSENTIALLY -- TO CONDUCT A REGULAR OVERSIGHT SUCH INFORMATION COULD BE REALLY REALLY HELPFUL. SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THEM. THANK YOU I I APPRECIATE THAT PROPOSALS AND I THINK -- GIVEN MY COMMENTS EARLIER ALL ASWE TALK ABOUT A CULTURE SHIFT THAT THAT THAT WHILE THESE ARE THE KINDS OF ACTIONS THAT ARE AT OUR DISPOSAL THAT THE LEGISATURE UTILIZING THE PASSWORDS MORE OF A CARROT STICK APPROACH. I THINK WE I WANT US TO THINK CREATIVELY. ON TO GO BE ON THIS LIST COLLEAGUES IN TERMS OF WAYS IN WHICH THAT WE REALLY CAN'T PRO ACTIVELY ENGAGE -- SO IT'S NOT A MATTER OF WE HOLD THE PURSE STRINGS YOU KNOW ON A KIND OF STEP BY STEP BASIS AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS -- UNLESS WE FEEL -- AS A LET'S THAT BODY THAT'S THAT'S OUR ONLY OPTION AVAILABLE TO US BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ENGAGED IN TERMS OF REALLY COMING UP WITH PERSPECTIVE SOLUTIONS -- QUESTION SENATOR ROBB THE MANAGER I ASSUME IN RESPONSE TO THE CHEERS EARLIER QUESTION IN THE INDICATION THAT WE WOULD SEE THE BUSINESS PLAN THE ACTION PLAN AND AND THE PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT ARE GOING TO BE USED TO ASSESS SUCCESS OR FAILURE HERE THAT. THAT THAT PLAN AND THOSE PERFORMANCE METRICS WILL ROUTE REFLECT THE THE REPORTS THAT THE LA -- WAS. AS ADDRESSING HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT WHETHER IT'S WAIT TIMES WHETHER IT'S ABSENTEEISM ALL THE OTHER -- ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PERFORMANCE ON IT. I ASSUME WE WILL SEE THOSE AND AND WHAT'S FOURTH COMING FROM YOU MA'AM. YEAH AND THE TIMING OF WHEN YOU RECEIVE IT I'M LIKE I CAN'T COMMIT TO BUT I WILL -- ASSURE YOU THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THAT BEFORE YOU FINALIZE. YOUR DECISION SO I THINK EVERY EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO GET IT TO YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I THINK YOUR POINT ON THE MEASURES AND AND I AGREE WITH THE LA -- ON ON THEIR GUIDELINES. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE A MENU OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE WHEN YOU SEE THE PLAN AND I THINK THE KEY THING IS WHAT ARE THE KEY PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES. THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SHARE A WORK TOGETHER AND WE CAN PROVIDE REPORTS BACK TO YOU WANNA. I THINK IS INDICATOR EARLIER WE ALREADY ARE DOING A MONTHLY REPORT -- ON THE THROUGH THE JAIL BC PROCESS. ON THE WAIT TIMES BUT I THINK -- MAYBE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO RE EXAMINE ONE OF THE THINGS YOU STILL WANT TO REPORT ON ARE THERE SOME NEW THINGS WE NEED TO REPORT ON AND WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE SILICON INFORM YOU -- MICHAEL IF I'M I'M ABLE TO GO HEAD CONTINUE IN THESE EFFORTS ULTIMATELY IS YOU WOULD FIND A DASHBOARD ON THE DMV WEBSITE. THAT'S IDENTIFYING OUR PERFORMANCE MEASURES -- THAT WOULD BE MY GOAL IN BRINGING IN A CONSULTANT TO WORK WITH ME TO ESTABLISH BOTH GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. AS WELL AS A PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT CULTURE -- AND THEN WE WILL BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY PERFORMING AS ORGANIZATION FOR OUR CUSTOMERS IN YOUR CONSTITUENCY THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. SENATOR SKINNER FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MOORE Là. THANK YOU -- POLICIES THAT I DID NOT HEAR ALL THE TESTIMONY BUT HI. I AM -- JUMPING TO AN ASSUMPTION THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT WHETHER JUST ADDING MORE PEOPLE. IS GOING TO REALLY ADDRESS YES ISSUES AND WHAT I KNOW IS THAT UNLESS THE DATA I HAVE THIS WRONG WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DMV OFFICES IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT CORRECT. BUILD OFFICES A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO ACTUAL FIELD OFFICES OKAY SO AND THE NUMBER OF TOTAL PEOPLE. BEING INCLUDED A BEING INCREASES IN ORDER OF ITS IN NINETEEN HUNDRED WORDS CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE ALREADY PROVED WHAT WERE HE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT ACROSS THAT NUMBER OF OFFICES THAT. THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND FIVE YEAH BUT IT AGAIN IT MAY SEEM. BOTH COULD BE CONSIDERED SMALL NUMBER PEOPLE OF PEOPLE IS REALLY ISSUE OR A LARGE NUMBER PEOPLE GET DEPENDING ON WHAT THE ISSUE IS. AND IF THEIR TEMPORARY AND NOT FULLY TRAINED BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE PART OF THE PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THIS IS A NEW PROCESS AND SO YOU KNOW WILL THEY BE ADEQUATELY TRAINED AND IF WE ARE. GOING TO BE MOVING TO SOME CHANGES IN SOFTWARE. FOR CHANGES IN -- GETTING. TRYING HOPE TO GET MATERIALS ELECTRONICALLY AGAIN IT'S LIKE. IS THIS ARE THESE PEOPLE WILL BE THE WILL THEY BE TRAINED OR WELL OUR EXISTING PERMANENT STAFF SO. IT'S I HAVE NOT READ THE DEAL LAUGHS PERFORMANCE AUDIT YET I KNOW THE THAT DMV'S NOW ENGAGED VACANCY. BUT IT'S JUST SEEMS LIKE BEFORE. I MEAN I HAVE NO PROBLEM ASSISTING THE DMV AND I WANT TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER WITH THEIR MONEY SPENT WELL YES PEOPLE DYING AND CLARITY AROUND HOW MANY PEOPLE AND OUR THEY'RE GOING EXACTLY SO. YES. OFFER -- KIND OF A WHAT I CALL AN ENTERPRISE VIEW AND THEN I'M GETTING INTO SOME OF THE PEOPLE NUMBERS ROBBIE I KNOW IS CAPABLE ADDRESSING THOSE IN DETAIL. I AGREE THAT JUST THREE PEOPLE AT A PROBLEM IS NOT A IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE BEST THING TO DO BUT I WILL TELL YOU IN THE LIGHT OF THE REAL ID SITUATION THAT DOES REQUIRE FACE TO FACE. INTERACTIONS REQUIRES US TO HAVE PEOPLE IT COUNTERS WORKING ON WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS THIS DOES REQUIRE A PEOPLE -- ENGAGEMENT -- WITH THE GUARDS -- TO THE STAFF THAT WE ARE BRINGING ON BAR REMEMBER THAT MOST OF THOSE ARE TEMPORARY POSITIONS THAT WE'RE BRINGING ON BOARD. BUT I FIND INTERESTING THE CONVERSATION THE LA BROUGHT UP AND IT'S VERY TRUE IN ANY GOOD WORK FORCE PLAN YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR SUCCESSION PLANNING. AND DMV DOES HAVE SUCCESSION PLANNING -- AREAS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING OUT. I SEE THIS OPPORTUNITY ALSO IS AS FOLKS MAY RETIRE OUT A DMV IT KIND OF GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING IN PEOPLE TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE ACTUALLY A GOOD PERMANENT EMPLOYEE COMING ONTO. THE DMV BUT TO YOUR POINT AS WE LOOK AT CHANGING OUR BUSINESS MODEL TO ACCOUNT FOR A WALK IN. CALL IN AND CLICK AND THOSE ARE REALLY THE THREE MODES AND ONE IS OUR MIND YOU IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'LL BE PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO DO BUSINESS WITH US THROUGH THEIR PHONE. AND THEIR COMPUTER BUT I WILL ALSO TELL YOU OPEN OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE ARE PEOPLE WOULD PREFER TO WALK IN AND DO BUSINESS WITH US AT OUR OFFICE. SO WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR ALL THREE MODES OF OPERATION TO SERVE HIM BUT YOUR POINT WE WANT TO MEASURE THE TRAFFIC. YEAH MEASURE THE APPROPRIATE STAFFING LEVELS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO ADDRESS THAT COMMUNITIES NEEDS AND HOW BEST TO SERVICE THEM SO -- YES THIS IS PERMANENT HELP OR BRING IN TO ADDRESS AN IMMEDIATE NEED FOR REAL ID WE DO HAVE A TRAINING PLAN -- I THINK THE STAFF WE'VE BROUGHT ON BOARD% OR ALREADY TREATING -- WE HAVE THE THREE HUNDRED STAFF AND WE'VE ARE CREATED TO TRAINING MODULE FOR THE THREE HUNDRED STAFFER ASKING. FOR AND THEN THE OTHER THING I WOULD HAVE THAT'S MUCH MORE MODERN AND WHEN YOU HAVE A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO OFFICES -- YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED IT IS BRINGING ON E. LEARNING. AND LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM GIVES US THAT FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT STATEWIDE TRAINING THAT PEOPLE CAN DO IT A DESKTOP AND WE CAN PROVIDE THAT FROM AN ONBOARDING STANDPOINT. IF THERE'S EVER A REFRESHER COURSE BASED ON THE EMPLOYEES SEATS AS WELL. AND IN SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED HER WAYS BY OTHER MEMBERS -- ALSO SEND TO SCAN I WANT YOU TO BE CAUGHT FOR THAT AS WELL AS THE THE DATA POINT THE CAME UP AS A RESULT. OF THE AUDIT WHICH TALKED ABOUT THE ABSENTEEISM RATE THAT THE OBSERVER IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF WINDOWS THAT WERE. EMPTY NOT STAFFED AND THAT WAS DISCUSSED AS WELL AS I ASK% MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO QUEUE UP WITH THE STANDING MIKE TO GET READY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT I WOULD JUST. SAY TO ACTING DIRECTOR WEB I THINK ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE LA L. THAT SECOND BULLET THAT REALLY TALKED ABOUT. ALL THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE THAT THE DM B. C. LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL BEFORE INCURRING ADDITIONAL SPENDING IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU WANT SPECIFICALLY. I'M SORRY SENATOR MORLOCK. JUST BECAUSE I'M SITTING WAY OUT HERE. JUST MAYBE TO SUMMARIZE -- I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THE TERM IN A ROW PRICE VIEW THAT YOU JUST USED BUT YOU ALREADY HAVE EXISTING RESOURCES YOU ARE A MAJOR REVENUE SOURCE FOR THE STATE WITH THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEES AND NOW THAT'S EXPANDED WITH THE GAS TAX -- THAT'S JUST BEEN APPROVED DO YOU CHARGE OTHER FEES ARE THOSE RETAINED IN YOUR DEPARTMENT YEP. THE DEPARTMENT COLLECTS ABOUT ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF THAT. ABOUT. TWO AND A HALF TO THREE BILLION IS MOTOR VEHICLE COME MONIES FOR THE MOTOR VEHICLE MONEY IS THE MONEY THAT THE DEPARTMENT UTILIZES ALL THE OTHER REMAINING COLLECTIONS THAT WE DO GOOD OTHER FUNDS. THAT WE DO NOT USE THAT ARE YOU BUT LIKE AN ENTERPRISE FUND YOU FIND YOURSELF. CORRECT WE LIVE MOTOR VEHICLE OUT WE ALSO GET AN APPROPRIATION FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY COUNT ASSOCIATE WITH THE WAY THINGS THAT WE COLLECT. AND THEN ALSO FOR THE MOTOR VEHICLE LICENSE FEE SO THAT'S FOR THE VLF. COM AND SO THOSE ARE THE THREE MAIN FUNDS THAT WE GET FROM A PREPARATION IT'S A MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT AS THE MAIN ONE WHICH IS THE THING FUND AS MUCH EARLIER THAN THAT TAMBIéN SEATS BE IT'S ONE OF FOUR AND THEN -- STATE HIGHWAY COUNTY LATE FEES AND THE MOTOR VEHICLE LICENSE FEE ACCOUNT WHICH IS FOR THE VLF. SO YOU'VE BEEN FINDING YOURSELF NOW WE'RE GIVING YOU MORE MONEY. WE'RE NOT RAISING FEES. AND WE DEPLETED A MOTOR VOTER VEHICLE ACCOUNT OR WE'VE BEEN PULLING AT LEAST SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY MILLION OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT. TO THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS SO THAT'S A REVENUE SOURCE TO THE STATE AS OPPOSED TO YOUR DEPARTMENT IS -- IS THAT A TRANSFER IS THAT ALONE IS THAT A AT THE MOMENT OF MY COMMUNITY. PARTNERSHIP FINANCE THAT'S THAT'S JUST AN ANNUAL BUDGETARY TRANSFER. SO IT'S LIKE REVENUE TO THE GENERAL FUND IN ITS. THANK YOU DMV AND THAT'S IT. THE NUMBER WE'RE HAPPY TO SEND THAT BACK NOW. DURING THIS [inaudible] PEAK PERIOD. THE CORRECT WE I MEAN THE THE REVENUES -- HOWEVER I CAN SPEAK TO THE THE DETAILS OF THAT THE THE REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY FROM THAT THE SALE OF INFORMATION THE DMV HAS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. RIGHT SO IN MINUTES AT THE TO GET INTO PRICING A WE WERE PROVIDING THE INFORMATION BUT WE'RE ALSO CHARGING THE COMPANIES FOR IT. AND SO -- AS SUCH IT DOESN'T HAVE ARTICLE NINETEEN LIMITATIONS TO IT AND SO IT'S BEEN LONG TERM CONSIDER GENERAL FUND REVENUE. THAT THE DMV COLLECTS BUT IN THIS CASE WERE PROPOSING A FIVE YEAR SUSPENSION OF THE THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH FANFARE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC WE HAVE. TO PROMISED HER ACTING CHAIRMAN MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. I JUST WANTED -- TO I'M FROM. CAN DRIVING RECORDS ARE BASED IN RANCHO CORDOVA. SO I KNOW THE GOVERNOR SAID YOU WANT TO BRING SILICON VALLEY TO THE DMV WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A RANCHO CORDOVA IS AN AND SILICON VALLEY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT CALIFORNIA OMPANIES THAT ALREADY. DO BUSINESS WITH THE DMV AND I HAVE BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH THE DMV SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX MORE THAN HALF MY LIFETIME NOW. AND I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT THIS IS A NEW ADMINISTRATION THAT'S OVER THERE. I THINK IS DOING A PHENOMENAL JOB I THINK. ARE THE DEPARTMENT HAS ABOUT TWELVE DEPUTY DIRECTORS I THINK. I THINK I KNOW ALMOST ALL OF THEM THEY ARE EXTREMELY. TALENTED TALENTED PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF GOOD IDEAS AND I AND I FEEL LIKE. THIS GROUP THAT IS IN THERE NOW AND THE STRIKE TEAM ARE REALLY LISTENING TO THEM MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE HAS THEY I DO BUSINESS WITH FIFTY STATES AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THIS BECAUSE I'M IN CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK YOU HAVE. SOME OF THE MORE STE TALENTED PEOPLE THE MOST EDUCATED PEOPLE AND THE MOST EDUCATED PEOPLE IN THAT DEPARTMENT VERSUS. ANY OTHER DMV I'VE BEEN TO OUR WORKED WITH AND SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF I WANT TO GIVE YOU A POSITIVE STORY I GUESS. AND I DID WANT TO ANSWER FOR SENATOR STONE'S QUESTION ABOUT THE TRIPLE A THEY DO NOT HAVE AN AXE THEY DO NOT OF EXCLUSIVITY. THERE'S FOR OTHER COMPANIES INCLUDING OUR COMPANY THAT ARE CALLED BUSINESS PARTNER AUTOMATION. OP PARTNERS AND SO WE SUPPORT A LOT OF THE MOM AND POP REGISTRATION PEOPLE YOU SEE IF YOU GO DOWN THE STREET AND SAY WE CAN GET YOU STICKERS. WE SUPPORT THEM SO WE ARE THE INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THEM BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME GLIMMERS OF GOOD NEWS YOU DO HAVE GREAT PEOPLE OVER THERE. HAVE DEDICATED PEOPLE THERE AND I THINK YOU KNOW HAVE LEADERSHIP THAT IS LISTENING TO THE DEPUTY DIRECTORS WHO HAVE A LOT OF GREAT IDEAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR I'M SURE THOSE FOLKS APPRECIATE SOME FAVORABLE COMMENTS. THANK YOU SIR NEXT. GOOD MORNING -- TUNE GOOD AFTERNOON THAT GREG HAYES ON BEHALF OF INTELLECTUAL TECHNOLOGY INK -- MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE I. T. I.
