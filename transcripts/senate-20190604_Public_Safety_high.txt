TO ITEM NUMBER TWO EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER. YOU MAY PROCEED. YEAH. THANK YOU AND I SINCE YOU'RE STANDING UNDER YOUR PROCEED QUICKLY. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND STAND IN IT. AB FORTY FOUR REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT THAT JUDGES MUST SENTENCE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. JAIL TIME AS OUR VERSION PROVISIONAL PROBATION FOR LOW LEVEL DRUG OFFENSES TO BE CLEAR. SERIOUS DRUG OFFENSES THAT ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR PROBATION ARE NOT INCLUDED UNDER THIS BILL. AB FOR A FOR RETURNS POWER TO THE COURSE BY ALLOWING THEM TO DECIDE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHAT THE DATES TIMES BEEN IN JAIL WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING IS A COSTLY OVERLY PUNITIVE AND AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF DETERRING DRUG RELATED CRIMES FOR EXAMPLE UNDER CURRENT LAW AN INDIVIDUAL THAT WOULD HAVE BETTER SERVE THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED. REHABILITATION PROGRAM COST LOS ANGELES COUNTY 1-700-080-0994 THE TIME SPENT IN JAIL FOR THE MORE A CAR THREE MORE INDIVIDUALS ONLY CONTINUES TO ADD PRESSUE ON ALREADY OVERCROWDED FACILITIES. I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS BILL STILL ALLOW JUDGES TO ORDER THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS IN JAIL IF NECESSARY. AB FOR A FOR SIMPLY ARBOR REMOVES ARBITRARY REQUIREMENTS AND RETURNED TO SENTENCING DISCRETION COURTS NEED TO OPERATE IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE WITH ME TO TESTIFY OF KATHY SURE FROM THE ACLU. SENATORS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD MONING CATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- AB FORTY FOUR WOULD GIVE PORTS GREATER DISCRETION AS TO THE CONDITIONS OF PROBATION FOR CERTAIN DRUG SALES AND TRANSPORTATION OFFENSES -- UNDER CURRENT LAW DISCRETION IS EXTREMELY LIMITED FOR THESE OFFENSES ON TYING JUDGES HANDS AND FORCING THEM IN ALMOST EVERY CASE TO IMPOSE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. OF SIX MONTHS OF INCARCERATION -- THIS BILL MAKES A REASONABLE ADJUSTMENT GIVING JUDGES THE DISCRETION THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONDITIONS OF PROBATION IN EACH CASE FIT FIT THE FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR OFFENDER IN CASE. A JUDGE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO IMPOSE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS OF INCARCERATION WHEN THE JUDGE FINDS INAPPROPRIATE. BUT THE JUDGE COULD CHOOSE OTHERWISE AND COULD TAILOR THE SENTENCE TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S RISKS AND NEEDS TO THE ULPABILITY IN THE NATURE AND SEVERITY OF THIS BILL SPECIFIC CRIME. AB FORTY FOUR GIVE JUDGES DISCRETION NOT TO INCARCERATED WHERE THAT DISCRETION IS MOST NEEDED IN LOW LEVEL DRUG CRIME CASES THIS WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR EVERYONE -- I ASKED I DON'T. LET'S SEE IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING GOING BACK AS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE AND THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT ANY OTHERS. ALL RIGHT M. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND YOU MAY HAVE TO USE. I DON'T KNOW THE STABLE VERY SMALL. YEAH YOU YOU CAN'T WAS A STANDING IS A GOOD THING ABSOLUTELY. MANAGER MEMBERS COURCELLES ORDER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OUR MAIN POINT IS THAT EXISTING LAW THE SECTION THAT IS BEING AMENDED PARTY ALLOWS A JUDGE IN THE WORDS OF THE STATUTE AN UNUSUAL CASE AND IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE TO STRIKE. THE CONFINEMENT CONDITIONSO WE DON'T THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE -- FOR A JUDGE TO BE ABLE TO ORDER THIS CONDITION OF CONFINEMENT WHICH HE OR SHE CAN DO UNDER CURRENT LAW. AND WE CAN STRIKE UNDER CURRENT LAW WE THINK EXISTING LAW STRIKES THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN. STUDIO CONDITION AS WELL AS THE JUDGES AUTHORITY TO WAIVE THAT WHEN THE JUDGE DEEMS APPROPRIATE SO FOR THOSE REASONS WITH ASKING ABOUT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE IF THERE'S AS SENATOR JACKSON'S WELL I I LIKE THE IDEA OF GIVING JUDGES DISCRETION I DISAGREE THAT. LIMITING IT TO UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE REALLY DOES THAT SO I AGREE THAT YOUR BILL DOES ASSIST WITH THAT. I HAVE A CONCERN NOW AND THAT IS THAT YOU YOU ANALOGIZE THE COST OF INCARCERATION VERSUS THE COST OF TREATMENT. AND I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IF WE HAD TREATMENT WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE LIKELY THEY HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES THAN WE HAVE BY JUST PUTTING SOMEONE IN JAIL OR IN PRISON FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE. NOT MUCH IS DONE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE IN A SERIOUS WAY. IT SHOULD BE AND WERE ASPIRING TO IT BUT I WONDER IF THERE IS ANY. DATA THAT SHOWS THAT BY. DIRECTING IS A CONDITION OF PROBATION. A DEFENDANT. TO TREATMENT AND TO THE PROGRAMS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ADDICTION. HAVE PROVEN TO BE ANYMORE SUCCESSFUL AND AND KEEPING IN MIND THAT I'M NOT SURE THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS OUT THERE -- AND SO I JUST WONDER -- IF WE'RE TALKING MORE ASPIRATIONAL LEE HERE THAN WE ARE ACT. TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH -- BY GIVING THAT JUDGE MORE DISCRETION TAKING AWAY THE MANDATORY HUNDRED AD DAY JAIL TIME. AND AND CENTER JUDGES YOU PROBABLY KNOW -- I DID NOT IT ON ALL REHABILITATION PROGRAMS IN C. C. R. REALLY TO TO GET TO HOW THESE PROGRAMS WORKING WITH FOUNDED A LADDER TRUCK PROGRAMS WITHIN CDC ARE THEY'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR -- WE HAVE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- AND AND SO I THE WORD ASPIRATIONAL -- I LIKE I BELIEVE IT'S WE CAN GET THERE AND NOT ONLY A WHOLE -- I THINK WE MUST GET THERE WE NEED TO ATTACK IT FROM BOTH ENDS. AND SO -- WE DO NEED TO BEEF UP OUR OUR FAMILY DRUG REHABILITATION PROGRAM BUT ARE CUTTINGTO BE ABLE PROGRAM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I BELIEVE THIS BILL. WILL HELP US GET THERE I'M SURE THAT A JUDGE WILL NOT JUST SEND SOMEONE SOME PLACE WHERE THEY CAN GET TREATMENT AND HOPEFULLY IT BEEFS UP SOME OF THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT WILL BE FOR THOSE THOSE PROGRAMS. MY LAST QUESTION IF I MAY MANAGED CARE. IF I WERE JUDGE AN I HAD AN OPTION -- TO GIVE SOME TO TO REQUIRE SOMEONE GO THROUGH TREATMENT VERSUS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS IN JAIL. THAT TO ME IS THIS THE CARROT AND THE STICK APPROACH THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING FOR BUT DO WE KNOW WHETHER OR NOT JUDGES DO HAVE THAT OPTION BECAUSE AS YOU SAY THE THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAM. A PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH TO THIS AND MANY COUNTIES IS JUST INADEQUATE SO WHAT DO YOU TELL A JUDGE AT THAT POINT IN TIME. I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ALLOWING JUDGES TO BE ABLE. TO TAKE THOSE THOSE OPTIONS I THINK BECAUSE OF THOSE THOSE DECADES DECADES LONG THE MANDATORY MINIMUMS WERE BECOMES VERY EASY JUST TO SEND SOMEONE. TO JAIL FOR A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS EXCEPT THAT. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE. ME DO THE WORK TO TRY TO FIND SOME PLACE TO PUT THEM THERE I THINK THAT WILL RELIEVE SOME JUDGES TO TAKE THAT EXTRA STEP. BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE JUDGES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WILL AND THAT THE WHOLE THE WHOLE CELEBRATION DEPARTMENT ALL THESE FOLKS HAVE. TO BOTH ALL THESE ALL THESE -- ALL THESE VARIOUS AGENCIES HAVE GOT TO HAVE ALTERNATIVES. AND AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING ARE YOU. HOW WE GONNA GET TO THAT POINT THAT IS THAT WOULD MAKE THIS MAKE LOGICAL GOOD SENSE THERE ARE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL? I CAN TRY TO GET YOU DATA ON THE ONES ACROSS THE STATE OF WAR HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SOME OF THEM ARE BUT THE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM. WE NEED TO GET MORE OF THEM AND SO MY QUESTION IS HOW HOW IS THIS BILL GOING. TO HELP THAT TO HAPPEN. THIS WILL HELP DRIVE MORE PEOPLE TO THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS NOT ALL OF THEM ARE OVER SPENT OR OR OR ALL THE RESEARCH IS BEING USED UP IS MY HOPE THAT MORE PEOPLE. WILL GO TO THOSE ORG MORTGAGES BOOK. AB AMP GO TO THOSE CENTERS HOPEFULLY GRAY DISTRICT WROTE THANK YOU. FIRST THERE ANY OTHER DISCUSSION SENATOR MORE LUCK. I'M GETTING ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH SIDES. BOTH SAYING. THE SAME THING WE WANT MORE DISCRETION. AND WE'RE BEING TOLD THERE IS ENOUGH DISCRETION AND IT SEEMS. TO TO REVOLVE AROUND THE WORD UNUSUAL CASE SO I CAN'T FIND THE DEFINITION OF UNUSUAL. WHAT WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF UNUSUAL CASE THAT TEST -- PURPOSE OF THIS BILL -- UNDER EXISTING LAW UNUSUAL CASES JUST MAYBE TO FAKE. AND AND NOT ACCOUNT FOR ALSO TESTS IN WHICH ADDITIONAL DISCRETION MAY BE NEEDED AND SO THIS THIS BILL WILL ALLOW FOR KIDS TO TAKE THOSE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION. SO UNUSUAL DOESN'T MEAN RARE. IT IS UP TO EVERY EVERY JUDGE WHAT UNUSUAL MEANS THIS OR ON'T HAVE A DEFINITION ARE YOU DON'T HAVE. HOPEFULLY THIS HELPS THANKS CLEARED IT UP. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. RIGHT ANY OTHER DISCUSSION -- WE'LL GO SEVEN GREAT WE HAVE A MOTION THOUGH YOU MAY CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE AYE VOTE. EXCELLENT -- LET'S DO A ROLL CALL ON AT MOTIONS TO PASS TO THE FLOOR SKINNER HI SKINNER I'M MORE LOCK. BRADFORD AREN'T BRADFORD AYE JACKSON. JACKSON AYE MITCHELL HI SO I MARROW NO REAL NO WIENER. WIENER HI. RIGHT THAT BILL IS OUT -- WE WILL NOW LET'S SEE. JONES SAWYER YOU HAVE MORSE GREAT SO AB. SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR THANK YOU. THE MORNING CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR CLARIFIES THE PENAL CODE TO ALLOW PEACE OFFICERS CAN VERY STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED TO CARRY FIREARMS. AND COMPLETED THE REQUIRED FIREARMS TRAINING TO PURCHASING YOU LIES FIREARMS ARE NO LONGER ON THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S ROSTER OF HAND GUNS IN SOME INSTANCES MANUFACTURES REFUSED TO PAY THE ANNUAL REQUIRED FEE. TO MAINTAIN A HAND GUN ON THE ROSTER OF SAFE GUNS AND THOSE GUNS ARE THEN UNABLE TO BE SOLD OR LEGALLY USE IN THE STATE. LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES THAT PURCHASE THESE HAND GUNS WHILE THEY WERE ON THE ROSTER MUST THEN REGULARLY PURCHASED NEW HANDGUNS. FOR THIS REASON THE STATE HAS EXEMPTED A NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT DUTIES FROM HAVING TO CARRY HAND GUNS ON THE ROSTER. FOR THIS REASON THIS DOES IT HOWEVER A PIECEMEAL APPROACH HAS MEANT THAT ONLY SOME OF THE AFFECTED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED THIS EXEMPTION. AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR SIMPLY EXTENDS EXEMPTION TO A LARGER GROUP OF AFFECTED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PURCHASING NEW HANDGUNS BECAUSE MANUFACTURERS. ARE WILLING TO PAY AN ANNUAL FEE WITH ME TO TESTIFY SHANE LEVINE REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION. SENATORS ARE RESPECTED ASPREY AIBO. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SHALL THE ENEMY THE CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCMENT'S DECISION. BUT WE ARE THE SPONSOR THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE ORIGINALLY SPONSORED AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY FIVE FROM THREE YEARS AGO -- WAS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA IS BILL ALONG WITH POOR I CAN THE STATE PROBATION OFFICERS WE WERE ABLE TO GET ALL OF OUR MEMBERS AND AT THAT TIME SO WE'RE SIMPLY SEEKING -- THAT EXEMPTION NOW -- TO FINALLY CLOSE THIS OUT WE HOPEFULLY WE HOPE BUT ONCE AND FOR ALL -- THESE OFFICERS INVESTIGATORS ARE ALL -- IN POSSESSION OF THESE FARMS NOW THEY'RE TRAINED ON THESE FIREARMS -- IN THERE JUST SIMPLY JUST CALM THE SAME SITUATION IN LIMBO AS THE OFFICERS IN THE PAST -- SO FOR THAT REASON WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MANAGER MEMBERS RANGER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION THIS BILL DOESN'T APPLY TO OUR MEMBERS BUT WE THINK IT'S GOOD POLICY. AND TREATS AWFUL LOT FOR SOME AN EQUALLY AND WE'VE GOT THREE I ABOUT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THURMOND OUR EIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY -- BEFORE I ASK MY COLLEAGUES I AM. I APPRECIATE WHAT. THE AUTHOR IS I'M TRYING TO DO IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THESE WHAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER LOOPHOLE. MY THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH IT. AND COLLEGE JEEZ WHAT WITH BEING ON CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IN THE REST WE DIDN'T GET TO COMMUNICATE THIS SAYS -- DIRECTLY BUT IS THE ABILITY THE LAW NOW ALLOWS FOR THE TRANSFER AND THE TRANSFER OR SALE COULD BE TO A PERSON WHO IS. NOT COVERED OTHERWISE AND AT LEAST THE ONLY. GREAT OF INHERITANCE TRUE BUT STILL IT IS -- IT IS -- OPENING UP A LITTLE BIT DOES RESTRICTIVE LAWS WE'VE HAD AND BUT IT RECOGNIZES THAT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO MAY ALREADY HAVE SUCH WEAPONS WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO HAVE THAT WEAPON BUT I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE TRANSFER. AND I WOULD BE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IF WE COULD. FIND LANGUAGE YES YES AND I WOULD HOPE IS A UNDER EXISTING POLICE PROCEDURES I DON'T SPEAK FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT -- THAT THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM DOING AT WITH NATALIE SANCTIONS BUT POSSIBLY LOSING THEIR JOB IF THEY WERE TO SELL. OUTSIDE THE THE LAW YES EXCEPT THEY CAN TRANSFER TO A FAMILY MEMBER GO AHEAD. SOON WE ACTUALLY SUPPORTED IN LANGUAGE THREE YEARS AGO THAT WOULD CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE TRANSFERRED ANYBODY OFFER OSTER SO I THINK THERE WAS AN ISSUE BACK THEN OF TRANSFER SALE SO WE ULTIMATELY LIMITED LIMITED ELIMINATED THAT AS WELL THE TIME. BUT NOT THE INHERENT INHERITANCE ISSUE BUT EIGHT ANY SAILOR TRANSFER RATE. BUT WE MAY NEED TO MAKE IT EXPLICIT IN THIS BILL DEFINITELY RIGHT YES WE SHOULD. OKAY -- CENTER BRADFORD I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED UNLAWFUL BECAUSE THE STATE'S. ABILITY TO CONCEAL ANXIOUS ABOUT ANY GOT A WEAPON YOU'RE ABLE TO CONCEAL SO CAN YOU FOR THE DIFFERENT LINE. SO THERE IS A THERE'S A PROCESS IN WHICH THE MANUFACTURER HAS TO PAY A FEE TO DOJ AND IT GOES THROUGH CERTAIN TESTING. AND THEIR CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WEAPONS SUCH AS HAVING A FOR EXAMPLE CHAMBER LOAD INDICATOR HAS TO GO THROUGH A DROP TEST SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT. SIMPLY THE MANUFACTURE GOES THROUGH THAT PROCESS PAYS A FEE AND THEN IT'S CONSIDERED ON pIN THE STATE AT THIS POINT EFFECTIVELY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THESE FEW -- AGENCIES IN APARTMENTS KERRY NON ROSTER FIREARMS. OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR -- I I WAS INTRIGUED BY THIS NOTION AND SO PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THAT. YOU YOU. THE DETERMINATION ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE ON THE SAFE HAND GUNS LIST IS BASED SOLELY ON WHETHER YOU'VE PAID THE FEE YOU'RE NOT. NOT AS NOT BASED ON WHETHER THE HAND GUN IS SAFER NOT TO TO PAY THE FEE TO UNDERGO THE TESTING AND THEN UNINSURED THEN THE DETERMINATION IS THAN MYSELF I DON'T PAY THE FEE. AND I DON'T UNDERGO THE TEST IT'S CONSIDERED OFF ROSTER. BUT NOT NECESSARILY ON SAY JUST OFF ROCKY AS I HAD GONE TO TESTING DO YOU CAN YOU GET THE POINT YEAH I DO AND AND IN THE CONFUSION ALSO IS AROUND THE WORD SAY FORCES ON SAFE ROSTER OFF OF ON RIGH NON ROSTER SO THAT'S WERE. THOSE TERMS ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY SO OFF ROSTER. BUT THE NOMENCLATURE THEN IS IT IS CONSIDERED UNSAFE UNSAFE BUT BUT IN. COMMON VERNACULAR. IT'S STATE ISN'T THE SAME DEFINITION IS UNSAFE IN TERMS OF LIKE THE TRUE SAFETY RIGHT THEY HAVE SOME ECONOMIES THEY HAVE ALL THIS IS A LOT OF THE SAME MECHANISMS I THINK IT'S SOME ADDITIONAL ITEMS. THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED -- WHEN THE STATUE WANTED TO KICK IN THE PLACE THAT THAT IN ORDER TO BE ON THE ROSTER FOR MANUFACTURERS SELL HERE TO JUST REGULAR EVERYDAY FOLKS? WHO YOU KNOW HAVE A HAND GUN THAT HAD TO MEET THE DIGITAL CRITERIA? GOT IT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. SENATOR JEFF YES FLOOD OKAY YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THE FACT THAT THE REASON THAT THERE DEEMED UNSAFE AS THEY HAVEPAID THE FEE. BUT IN SOME INSTANCES THESE FARMS ARE AND SAFE YOUR RESPECTIVE THE FEAR NOT IS IN THAT IS NOT TRUE. I MEAN IT. I DON'T KNOW THERE CERTAINLY MAYBE SOME. WITHIN THE STATE THAT ARE UNSAFE I'M ONLY DISCUSSING WHAT CURRENTLY OFFICERS HANDLE SO WE'RE TALKING LOCAL DA'S OFFICE IS YOUR LOCAL RANK AND FILE POLICE -- I GUESS YOU COULD COULD TECHNICALLY BASED ON THE LAW THEIR CARING ON SAFE -- BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST A STANDARD ISSUE GLOCK NINE FOR EXAMPLE THAT WOULD BE TECHNICALLY CONSIDERED UNSAFE AS IT RELATES TO THIS BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN MECHANISMS THAT. THAT THAT THAT PARTICULAR FIREARM HAS. OR DOESN'T HAVE THAT WOULD PRECLUDE SOMEBODY LIKE ME FOR EXAMPLE WHO'S NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PURCHASE THAT. AND GOT. BUT NOW WE'VE WE'RE EXPANDING THIS TO INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH FULL LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING. ON A REGULAR BASIS WHO MAY NOT NECESSARILY KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY HANDLE AN UNSAFE HAND GUN THAT IS ON SAFE I THAT HAS A QUICK TRIGGER OR SOMETHING THAT -- HAS HAS CREATED THAT NOMENCLATURE OF UNSAFE NOT SHOWS THAT THEY DIDN'T PAY A FEE IS NINE IS THAT CORRECT. YES -- SUE THESE PARTICULAR OFFICERS ARE ALREADY IN POSSESSION THIS WOULDN'T BE NEW PURCHASES OR ADDITIONAL WEAPONS ARE IN POSSESSION THEY'RE TRAINED ON THESE THEY HAVE TO BE THEY GO TO THE FIRING RANGE IN THEIR TRAIN QUARTERLY. THEY'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH BASIC POST OF FIREARMS TRAINING COURSE AND THEIR TRAIN QUARTERLY -- SO IT'S NOT THAT THERE'S NO DEFICIT IN TRAINING. TRAIN QUARTERLY SO THIS CORRESPONDENCE THE ARGUMENT IN OPPOSITION THAT SAYS MANY OF THE NEWLY EXEMPT EMPLOYEES UNDER THIS BILL WILL NOT BE FULL TIME SWORN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND WILL NOT BE REQUIRED. TO COMPLETE THE POST TRAINING THAT'S AN INACCURATE STATEMENT YES CENTER [inaudible] AND OKAY SO. IN IN HOW MANY. INSTANCES HAVE WE FOUND COMPANIES WHOSE FIREARMS ARE DEEMED UNSAFE BECAUSE SIMPLY THEY HAVEN'T PAID THE FEE. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT CENTER I'M SORRY. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] FROM. THE SO WE CLARIFIED THAT YEAH I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE THE TRANSFER BUT I'M ALSO. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS -- THAT THESE ARE HAND GUNS THAT ARE -- ALLOWED. ON THE JOB AND ARE PURCHASED BY THE AGENCIES I AM WONDERING WHY IS IT THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY THE OFFICER WOULD HAVE THAT AS PART OF THEIR JOB. WHY WOULD WE ALLOW FOR THE PERSONAL PURCHASE? SURE YOU TALK ABOUT THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES HAVE PERSONAL PURCHASE OVER THAT THAT'S RIGHT OR STAND. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW. ALSO THEY'RE THEY'RE ALREADY PERMITTED ON DUTY I I THINK THERE'S LIKE DUDE RIGHT PLEASES. AND THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT THEIR PERMITTED ON DUTY THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE PERMITTED OFF DUTY. SO THE ARGUMENT BEING IF IF THIS IS PERMITTED THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CARRY THESE ON DUTY AND JUST PURCHASED AND PERSONALLY OR YOU'RE SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO ALSO PURCHASE THESE PERSONALLY IS AT THE CONGESTION. YES THEY WOULD PERSON PURCHASE THEM PERSONALLY -- I I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER FOR FOR THAT I'D EIGHT I MEAN IF THEY'RE EXEMPTED TO CARRY THEM ON THE JOB I DON'T KNOW. AT THAT POINT WHAT WE DO. TO PRECLUDE THAT FROM PERSONAL ACQUISITION I MEAN IFTHEY'RE ALREADY. CONSIDERED THE EXAM THEY'RE ALREADY TRAINED. I'M I'M NOT. I'M NOT -- OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE THAT THERE PROBABLY PERMITTED TO USE ON THE JOB THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE. ALLOWED TO PURCHASE -- BUT I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY -- POTENTIAL ITEMS -- SO THAT IS -- ANOTHER UNCOMFORTABLE EDDIE I HAVE WITH THE ABILITY TO JUST TO JUST PURCHASED PERSONALLY. OKAY SO. WOULD YOU. WANT TO DISCUSS. RIGHT WITH THOSE AND DOES TEND TO LIMóN YES. YES YES THEY ARE OPEN TO THAT GREAT [inaudible] APPRECIATE THAT. THE HEADLINER JACKSON REALLY TROUBLED BY THIS BILL I APOLOGIZE -- WHY DO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE COMPANIES NOT TO PAY THE FEE TO MAKE SURE THEIR GUNS ARE SAFE? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE GONNA LET WE'RE GOING TO LET LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTINUE TO BUY THESE FIREARMS. FOR INDIVIDUAL USE AND WHAT HAVE YOU -- AND I'M I'M CONFUSED AS TO WHY WE WOULD WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT. HELLO THIS IS FOR EXISTING ARMS THAT THEY HAVE NOW NOT TO GO AND BUY NEW ARMS. REDUCE THE TOAST [inaudible] THOSE. THOSE RESTRICTIONS WERE YOU HAVE TO GO FOR MAIN GUN MANUFACTURERS AND ALL THOSE. GUNS THAT NEED TO GO THROUGH THE TESTING AND PAID OF THE ANNUAL FEE -- THAT WILL STILL STAY IN PLACE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO AROUND THAT THEY WILL BEGIN AT EXEMPTION FOR YOU. SO THIS IS FROZEN IN TIME SO LET'S SAY THAT THERE'S COMPANY COMPANY X.. MAKES A NATION YOU KNOW A A FIREARM THAT IS APPROPRIATE ISSUE. AND THEN AND YOU BUY IT IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND IN FIVE YEARS THEY'VE STOPPED PAYING THEIR ANNUAL FEE WITH THIS BILL APPLIES SO THAT THEY CAN BE IF YOU WERE GRANDFATHERED IN. AS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF YOU KNOW STARTED BUYING A GUN MMHM. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY CALLED I BY LIGHT I MEAN? TO SAY IN A GENERAL HOW THE LAW WOULD APPLY. AFTER SOMEONE. STOPS. AFTER MANUFACTURE STUFF COMMUNITY FOR FREE I WOULD HAVE TO READ THE LOG IN ON THAT PARTICULAR ONE FIND OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THANK YOU. FOR RIGHT NO OTHER DISCUSSION ON THE DíAS I'D BE COMFORTABLE HAVING THE BILL MOVE FORWARD WITH THE YET WITHIN MINUTES WE DISCUSSED. AND WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO THAT -- IN THAT REGARD GREAT -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR DISCUSSION. ALL RIGHT WELL -- RESPECT SLASH RELIABLE THANK YOU. WE WILL HAVE A ROLL CALL. SHE IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS WITH AMENDMENT AS A MINUTE AGO. SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MORLOCK. BRADFORD MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE JACKSON. MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MORALE ALL RIGHT WELL I WIENER. WE WILL -- KEEP THE ROLE OPEN IN CASE OUR OTHER MEMBER COMES BACK AND THANK YOU THANK YOU COMMITTEE. RIGHT CAN WE WILL NOW GO. TO AB -- FIVE NINETY SEVEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE GOOD. THANK YOU SENATOR -- MANAGER% NUMBERS EIGHTY FIVE NINETY SEVEN EXPENSES ON STATE DATE. ON THE USE OF FLASH INCARCERATION TOLD TWENTY TWENTY THREE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ON PROBATION ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW WHAT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DISRUPT THOSE LIVES AND THE LIVES OF OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. IN WITNESSES IN SUPPORT GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHEAPER BE SHOP THERE'S OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS AND APPRECIATE THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR CARRYING THIS. ON THIS REALLY IS A MODEST SUNSET EXTENSION ON A POLICY CURRENTLY IN PLACE THAT FOCUSES ON HOLDING OFFENDERS ACCOUNTABLE WHERE THERE IS A VIOLATION OF SUPERVISION BUT IN A WAY THAT IS. MUCH LESS DESTRUCTIVE -- FOR THEIR PROGRAMMING WORK IN AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE IT ALLOWS FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE FORMAL COURT REVOCATION PROCESS WHICH CAN RESULT IN. A CUSTODY TIME OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS -- WE HAVE -- WORKED VERY CLOSELY WHEN THIS FIRST ONE INTO A FACT WITH BOTH THIS COMMITTEE IN ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY TO BUILD IN A NUMBER OF PARAMETERS -- AS TO HOW IT WOULD OPERATE IN TERMS OF GIVING THE DEFENDANT THE ABILITY TO DECLINE FLASHING GO THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS SUPERVISOR SIGN OFF -- WE NOTIFY MANY OF OUR PARTNERS AS EVIDENCED -- IN THEIR SUPPORT IN THE ANALYSIS SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. TO THE MATH IS A MAP CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. MANAGER MEMBERS STAND PULLS OUT ON BEHALF LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT. MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS THE NATION STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT. CORY CELLS ALONG THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. GENERAL INSTRUMENT WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. FOR FOR HER. MY APOLOGIES A MADAM CHAIR FOR SOME REASON WE'RE NOT LISTED ON THE ANALYSIS BUT I BELIEVE WE'VE. GOTTA. OKAY WELL WE'VE WE'VE HAD -- THAT ARE NOT SURE HERNANDEZ OF ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TERMS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE LAWYER. OR AS WE HAVE OPPOSE LESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL HOW FOR A WHILE -- AS WAS INDICATED ON THE ORIGINAL BILL -- WE WERE OPPOSED TO IT AT THAT TIME WE WERE INVOLVED IN SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS -- WE WE ARE NOT -- CONVINCED OF THE USE OF FLASH INCARCERATION IN THE WAY THAT IT WAS STRUCTURED IN REGIONAL BILL -- WE'RE CERTAINLY STILL NOT CONVINCED THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO -- SO FOR THOSE REASONS YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND TO SUNSET EXTENSION ARE PART OF THE REASON WHY WE HAD TO SUNSET IN THE FIRST PLACE. WAS TO REVIEW HOW WAS BEING USED TO DETERMINE WHAT KINDS OF CASES WHEN WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO REVIEW AND ASSESS. MAYBE A DIFFERENT APPROACH DIFFERENT CRITERIA THE USE OF THAT -- NOT FAMILIAR WITH AN IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE LAW UP UNTIL THIS POINT ON WHICH CERTAINLY DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE AUTHORS HAVING GOOD INTENTION OF TRYING TO EXTEND SOMETHING -- BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DONE NOW IS PART OF THE POINT OF THE OF THE SUNSET ON HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT AT THE TIME. THAT THE THAT THIS THIS BILL WENT FORWARD THE ORIGINAL ONE FORWARD -- THERE WAS A HEAVY DEBATE OVER PROP OF THIRTY SIX FOR A PROP THIRTY SIX THERE WASN'T A LOT OF FUNDING FOR DRUG. OF CANCELING AND TREATMENT AND SO WE WANTED THE BIG FIGHT OVER THIS KINDS OF KIND OF THING AND THIS WAS KIND OF BROUGHT UP. AS A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ACTUALLY WENT TO TREATMENT AND REALLY FOLLOW THROUGH WHAT WE KEPT SAYING IS THERE NEED TO BE MORE FUNDING FOR DRUG TREATMENT. MORE AVAILABILITY AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE AGREED. TO THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKED AT GOING FORWARD THE MAJOR TREATMENT MORE AVAILABLE IN MAY BE OFFSET THE NEED FOR FLASH CAR SERRATION. ALSO THAT THERE BE LESS INSTANCES OF THAT -- AND CERTAINLY THAT WAS KIND OF ON THE TAIL END OF THE OF THE RECESSION SO THE UPSIDE AND DOWNSIDE OF ME BEING AROUND FOR A LONG TIME ON HIS PUBLIC SAFETY BILLS IS THAT. YOU KNOW I KIND OF KNOW THE TRAJECTORY OF THIS BILLS IN THE POLICY -- AND SO WE'RE KIND OF IN THIS KIND OF STRANGE SITUATION WHERE -- IT WAS HIGHLY DEBATED EVEN THOUGH WHEN FORWARD A FEW YEARS BACK -- THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN FOR SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN WE'RE HOPING WOULD HAPPEN SINCE THEN HAVEN'T QUITE HAPPENED. FOR THOSE REASONS WE HAVE TAKEN OPPOSE POSITION THE RESPECT THE AUTHOR -- WHO WHO IS VERY GOOD ON THESE ISSUES AND VERY THOUGHTFUL ON THESE ISSUES -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY -- SOME THE WORK I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE SINCE THE ORIGINAL LAW -- WE DON'T THINK IT'S HAS TOTALLY BEEN DONE FOR THOSE REASONS HAVE OPPOSE AWESOME AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION. SOME OF THE SUNSET IS AN EXTENDED. THEN IS THE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL FROM READING THE ANALYSIS IS. THE IT WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT. THE PERSON AT THE PROBATION BY LATER IN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. AND WITHOUT THIS DOUBT. I MEAN. FOR ME THE I'M NOT EVEN NECESSARILY COMFORTABLE WITH FLASH INCARCERATION JUST BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE FOLKS -- IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WE WANT WE ARE HOPING THAT THEY ARE -- STARTING TO FUNCTION APPROPRIATELY AND THE COMMUNITY THEY HAVE A JOB THEY HAVE AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT ANY DETENTION INTERFERES WITH THEIR ABILITY. TO CONTINUE THEIR EMPLOYMENT TO CONTINUE WHATEVER WORK THEY WERE DOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL OR REENTRY -- HOWEVER A LONGER TIME A DETENTION SEEMS TO BE VERY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE SO IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT. YEAH WELL I APPRECIATE AND I THINK SOME OF THE FOCUS ON MIGHT BE COVERED BY THINK THE BILL THOSE HEARD EARLIER TODAY FROM NOT FROM NOT MISTAKEN -- BUT YES -- WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS LOOKED AT AS SOME SORT OF ALTERNATIVE TO THAT WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS GOOD BUT WE WE DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT. I GUESS MY ANSWER TO THAT IS. WHAT WE SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF A OF THE ORIGINAL LAW WHICH IS FASHION CORPORATION BY ITSELF IS NOT THE WAY TO GO THAT THERE SHOULD BE OTHER ALTERNATIVES AND THERE SHOULD BE DIGITAL FUNDING SO THAT? FASHION COURSE RATIONS IS ONE OF THE LAST RESORTS -- FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IT'S HARD TO ANSWER THAT DIRECTLY BECAUSE I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT AMENDED SOME OF THE CRITERIA. HAVE AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE AND AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A SUSTAINED OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO SUCCEED. I THINK THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE THERE MAY BE AS SOME PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WERE BENEFITS BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY FLASHCARTS RATIONS UNNECESSARYGONNA KICK THEM INTO. NO BETTER JOB TREATMENT SO I DON'T KNOW THAT. WE'RE SAYING GET RID OF THE SUNSET AND THEN LET GO BACK TO HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT LET'S LET'S. MOVE THIS AROUND A LITTLE BIT LET'S MANIPULATE A LITTLE BIT SO THAT THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES AND BETTER WAYS TO DO IT AND I THINK THAT WAS WERE ORIGINAL. COMPOSITIONS I DO APOLOGIZE TO THE CHAIR OF I'VE I'VE CHARMS ARE THE AUTHOR WHO GET GOOD RELATIONS OFFICE WE HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH WHAT SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVES -- COULD BE BUT CERTAINLY WILLING OF THIS AS SOON THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS IF THERE'S WAYS THAT WE CAN TREAT THIS GOING FORWARD -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE DID YOU WANNA THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I DID WANT TO JUST MAKE THE POINT THAT FLASHING COURSE RATIONS A VOLUNTARY OPTION. THAT IS RARELY -- TURNED DOWN AT ALL AND MISS CENTERS HAD SOME COMMENTS FOR CLARIFICATION FROM THE THE OPPOSITIONISTS POINTS I NEED TO THE CHAIR. I JUST BRIEFLY -- WE WE AGREE THAT FLASHING CONSERVATION SHOULD NOT BE THE THE FIRST -- ALTERNATIVE TO A VIOLATION IT'S DEPENDED UPON REALLY -- THE TYPE OF VIOLATION AND WE WANT TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A GRADUATED SANCTIONS SO ONE OF THE THINGS BUILT INTO THE BILL. REQUIRES A BEHAVIOR MATRIX WHICH IS BASED ON RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES TO SAY THAT -- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE ON THE TYPES OF VIOLATIONS AND THIS WOULD ONLY BE IMPLEMENTED AND IN THE CASE IN WHICH THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE THE EXISTING COURT REVOCATION PROCESS SO CERTAINLY THIS IS NOT INTENDED -- TO UPON MINOR THINGS WE WANT TO KEEP THE PERSON -- UNDER OUR CARE AND SUPERVISION ON TRACK AND IF IT BECOMES A THING WHERE THEY MISSED AN APPOINTMENT WE WANT TO SAY THAT SEAL AS LONG AS WE CAN RESET THAT AND CONTINUE WORKING LET'S DO SO. BUT IF IT'S A SIGNIFICANT THING THAT THEY DON'T SIGN UP -- FOR THEY DON'T REGISTER -- FOR AS A SEX OFFENDER OR SOMETHING THAT RISES TO A LEVEL BASED ON THAT MATRIX THIS WOULD THEN BE IMPLEMENTED AGAIN IT'S STILL VOLUNTARY ON THE PERSON'S BEHALF -- THE AVERAGES AS AS WE'VE SEEN STATEWIDE IS LESS THAN THE TEN DAY MAXIMUM I KNOW THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP SO I THINK REALLY IN PRACTICE WHAT WE SEEN ON A WITH THE SAFEGUARDS AT THIS COMMITTEE IN ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY HAS BUILT IN -- THAT HAVE BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL TO THE DEFENDANT AND THE PERSON ON PROBATION -- TO BALANCE ALL OF THOSE THINGS. SENATOR JACKSON'S. THANK YOU HI I AM. I GUESS THE THING MIND -- WONDERING ABOUT TODAY IS. ARE WE FUNDING THESE ALTERNATIVES APPROPRIATELY WE WE KNOW THE PUTTING JUST PUTTING PEOPLE IN. JAIL AND PRISON IS NOT THE ANSWER. BUT WE DO AND WE DO KNOW THAT SOME OF THE ANSWERS TREATMENT. AND EDUCATION AND THEIR WHOLE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THINGS. BUT MY QUESTION IS ARE WE DOING THOSE THINGS -- I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE OLD WAY OF JUST THROWING PEOPLE. IN PRISON AND THROW AWAY THE KEY WHICH I THINK WOULD BE A TERRIBLE. TRAGEDY YEAH -- SO -- IF I MAY JUST ASK YOU. WHAT IS THE THE GOAL AND THEN THE AND IS THERE A MEASURE OF SUCCESS FOR FLASH INCARCERATION? YEAH IF IF I MAY TO THE CHAIR THE IT REALLY IS BASED ON RESEARCH NATIONAL RESEARCH THAT TALKS ABOUT -- GRADUATED SANCTIONS AND AND A SWIFT AND CERTAIN SANCTIONS SO AGAIN WHERE WHERE SOMETHING RISES TO THE LEVEL OF NEEDING -- TO POTENTIALLY VIOLATE THAT PERSON OR OR HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE IT'S IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS FOR A VERY QUICK KIND OF INTERVENTION. BUT IT IS LEAST DISRUPTIVE AS POSSIBLE TO ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE OF WHEN THEY ARE ON PROBATION WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM TO GET THEM CONNECTED. TO SUBSTANCE USE THE TREATMENT COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY GET THEM INTO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS AND SO WE CERTAINLY ARE INVESTED IN NOT WANTING TO DISRUPT THAT WHERE THERE'S PROGRESS.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALLEY JACOBS AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB. SIX OH THREE FROM 200-022-00013. IT I WAS HONORED TO WORK AS A POLICE OFFICERAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. LIKE EVERY OTHER CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WILL TELL YOU POLICE WORK CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING. BUT ALSO VERY REWARDING. IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINE I WAS PRESENT WITH ONE OF THOSE UNIQUE CHALLENGES. A MAN BY THE NAME OF PHILLIP GARRIDO CAME ON TO THE UC BERKELEY CAMPUS IS TO MEET WITH THE STAFF MEMBER OF THE CAMPUS POLICE DEPARTMENT. THIS CAMPUS POLICE STAFF MEMBER IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE THAT PHILLIP GARRIDO DISPLAYED SOME ODD BEHAVIORS AND SHE ASKED ME TO HELP HER INTERVIEW HIM. GARRIDO WAS ACCOMPANIED BY TWO YOUNG GIRLS THAT HE CLAIMED WERE HIS DAUGHTERS. I DID A RECORD CHECK ON GARRIDO AND DISCOVERED HE WAS ON PAROLE FOR KIDNAPPING AND RAPE. HE WAS ALSO A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER. I SPOKE WITH GARRIDO AND IS A RADIC BEHAVIOR CONCERNED ME BECAUSE HE DID HAVE TWO YOUNG GIRLS WITH HIM. BUT NO PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST CREDO FOR ANY CRIME AT THE TIME I VERY RELUCTANTLY LET HIM LEAVE CAMPUS WITH HIS TWO DAUGHTERS. I COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THOSE TWO YOUNG GIRLS AND I FOLLOWED UP WITH GARRIDO'S PAROLE OFFICER THAT DAY. AND REQUESTED THAT THE PAROLE AGENTS CONDUCT A WELFARE CHECK ON THE CHILDREN SINCE THEY WERE HOME SCHOOLED. TO MY SHOCK THE PAROLE AGENT FOR ME THAT GARRIDO DID NOT HAVE ANY CHILDREN. AND MY HEART SANK. THE VERY NEXTDAY THE PAROLE AGENT INFORMED ME THAT HE DID FOLLOW UP ON MY CONCERNS AND THEY DISCOVERED THAT PHILLIP GARRIDO. WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR KIDNAPPING JAYCEE DUGARD IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE FROM SOUTH LAKE TAHOE SCHOOL BUS STOP. WHEN JC WAS JUST ELEVEN YEARS OLD? HE HELD HER CAPTIVE FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS IN A SHED IN HIS BACKYARD AND REPEATEDLY RAPED HER FATHER AND TWO YOUNG CHILDREN WHO MIGHT MATT ON CAMPUS THAT DAY. WHEN THE NEWS OF JEEZY'S RESCUE BROKE I WAS THRUST INTO THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT WITH INTERVIEWS ON CNN'S ANDERSON COOPER ABC NIGHTLINE? THE NEWS MEDIA SIXTY MINUTES AND THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW INITIALLY I DID NOT WANT TO DO THE INTERVIEWS BUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REQUESTED THAT I PARTICIPATE. SO I BECAUSE IT WAS A POSITIVE STORY FOR THE UNIVERSITY SO I RELUCTANTLY AGREED. I WAS HAILED A HERO BUT I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A HERO. I JUST FELT LIKE I WAS DOING MY JOB AS A POLICE OFFICER AND WHILE I I WAS HAPPY TO GZ WAS NOW SAFE. I WAS UPSET THAT SHE HAD TO SUFFER FOR SO LONG. NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT I DON'T THINK ABOUT J. C. WITH HER FAMILY. I AM THANKFUL FOR THE ROLE THEY PLAYED IN HELPING HER RECOVERY% NO POLICE OFFICER EVER PLANS. TO GET HURT. BUT DUE TO UNPREDICTABLE NATURE OF OUR JOB AN INHERENT DANGERS INJURIES O HAPPEN. SOMETIMES THESE INJURIES ARE SO SERIOUS THAT THE END OUR CAREERS UNFORTUNATELY. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN I SUFFERED AN ON DUTY INJURY THAT PROVED TO BE CAREER ENDING FOR ME. AFTER TO PAINFUL SURGERIES LEAVING ME WITH MASS OF SCAR TISSUE AND LIFELONG CHRONIC PAIN I WAS MEDICALLY SEPERATED AS THE UNIVERSITY POLICE OFFICE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA POLICE OFFICER IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN AND JUST LIKE THAT. MY LAW ENFORCEMENT CAREER WAS OVER. UPON MY MEDICAL SEPARATION I REQUEST IT FROM MY DEPARTMENT WHAT EVERY OTHER CALIFORNIA POLICE OFFICER IS ENTITLED. TO AN HONORABLY RETIRED IDENTIFICATION CARD WITH AN ENDORSEMENT TO CARRY A CONCEALED FIREARM TO PROTECT MYSELF AND MY FAMILY. YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SHOCK AND DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REFUSED TO ISSUE AN HONORABLY RETIRED POLICE ID DUE TO A TECHNICALITY IN WORDING OF THE PENAL CODE. I WAS EVEN MORE DISAPPOINTED WHEN I LEARNED TO THE UNIVERSITY USED TO ISSUE THESE HONOR HONORABLY RETIRED ID CARDS TO MEDICALLY SEPERATED OFFICERS FOR ALMOST TWO DECADES. BUT THEN SUDDENLY REVERSE THIS PRACTICE IN TWENTY TWELVE IT'S BEEN ALMOST TEN YEARS AND I STILL GET RECOGNIZED AS THE OFFICER THAT HELPED RESCUE JAYCEE DUGARD. THIS CONSTANT RECOGNITION CAUSED ME TO ALTER MY PHYSICAL APPEARANCE BECAUSE I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE OR SAFE BEING RECOGNIZED AS A POLICE OFFICER. ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M WITH MY KIDS. SINCE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CHANGED ITS POLICY IN TWENTY TWELVE HI AND MANY OTHERS IN MY SITUATION HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OBTAIN AN HONORABLY RETIRED ID CARD. AN ENDORSEMENT TO CARRY A CONCEALED FIREARM TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR FAMILIES. AB SIX SO THREE WILL FIX THAT TECHNICALITY IN THE PENAL CODE AND WILL SIMPLY RESTORE THE PRIVILEGES THAT MANY INJURED UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA POLICE OFFICERS ENJOYED FOR ALMOST WO DECADES. I'M THANKFUL THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELENDEZ HAS INTRODUCED AB SIX OH THREE AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT I CAN OFFER MY STRONG SUPPORT AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME. AND I HOPE ALL OF YOU WILL VOTE IN FAVOR IT'S EIGHTY SIX OH THREE THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I'D LIKE [inaudible] TO OKAY. GOOD MORNING SCOTT HANDLE ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERATED UNIVERSITY PLACE OFFERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT ANY OTHERS. THREE OF ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- IT SEEING NONE WE HAVE A MOTION TO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MOMENTOUS -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M SORRY BEFORE YOU CLOSE CENTER JACKSON YES THANK YOU FOR YOUR STORY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE I'M STILL WONDERING WHY WE ARE -- PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR RETIRED. OF POLICE OFFICERS XIN OTHERS TO CARRY CONCEALED WEAPONS COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME. WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT IS APPROPRIATE -- I CAN EXPLAIN THAT TO SEE ISSUE IN UC'S UNDER DIFFERENT SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO CALPERS AND DISABILITY. SO ONE GETS THIS DESIGNATION OF MEDICALLY RETIRED THE OTHER DOES NOT THAT'S WHERE THERE'S DIDN'T SEEM TO BE PARITY BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE BOTH. CONSIDER THE SAME AND I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY AGAIN I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHY WE'RE ENCOURAGING CONCEALED WEAPONS -- PERMITS FOR RETIRED OFFICERS WERE RETIRED ANYONE I CAN THINK OF PERHAPS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO MAY FEEL THE SAME LEVEL OF RISK BEING IDENTIFIED AS POLITICIANS BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE THEM AND WOULD LIKE TO BE CARRYING CONCEALED WEAPONS TO WEEK. WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF CONCEALED WEAPONS OUT THERE I GUESS. SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY YES HI I DON'T SEEM TO BE. SO MOVED BY THAT IDEA -- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND YOU MAY THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT. YES IN RESPONSE TO THAT -- NO DISRESPECT TO YOUR POSITION OR ANYONE ELSE'S RISK POSITION WHEN THEY RETIRE BUT POLICE OFFICERS JOBS ARE INHERENTLY DIFFERENT WE ARREST CRIMINALS WE TAKE AWAY THEIR FREEDOMS. AND WE DO GET RECOGNIZED BY THEM ON THE STREET WHEN WE'RE AT SAFEWAY WITH LET'S SAY -- THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHERE I'VE BUMPED INTO PEOPLE WHO -- WERE DRUG DEALERS THAT I'VE ARRESTED AND ARE HAPPY WITH ME AND THE TRAINING THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN AS POLICE OFFICERS CARRY ON AND CONTINUE TO GET THAT TRAINING ONCE WERE RETIRED. IN ORDER TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM FROM THAT RECOGNITION THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. ALRIGHT SO NOW A SIMILAR MELENDEZ YOU MAKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TRYING CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS FROM SENATOR JACKSON -- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO -- AS YOU STATED ARE ARE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE HAVING MORE CONCEALED CARRY WEAPONS OUT THERE BUT I THINK IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE'RE TALKING A DIFFERENT SITUATION WE'RE CERTAINLY TALKING ABOUT -- INDIVIDUALS WHO VERY PROVE THEMSELVES TO BE WORTHY OF HANDLING A WEAPON AND AND CERTAINLY KNOWING -- HOW TO USE THAT WEAPON PROPERLY SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT?
