SO JUST VERY QUICKLY BY BY WAY

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:01.634
OF BACKGROUNDTO THE C. M. C. R.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.068
WAS ESTABLISHED IN.

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.103
TWO THOUSAND WITH THE PASSAGE OF

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:06.038
THE COMPASSIONATE USE ACT --

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:07.606
CENTER VASCONCELOS SPONSORED A

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:10.009
BILL TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:11.710
OF RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC DATA

REGARDING CANNABIS AS POSSIBLE

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:15.581
POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE A FAX.

00:15:15.648 --> 00:15:17.249
DURING THAT ERA WE GOT SOME

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:18.584
FUNDING TO AND DID SEVEN

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:20.686
CLINICAL TRIALS THE FIRST

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.454
CLINICAL TRIALS IN TWENTY YEARS

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.323
THE SMOKE OUT OF US -- AT ALL OF

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:24.990
THEM SHOWED POSITIVE RESULTS IN

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:26.892
VERY SHORT.

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:27.793
TERM STUDIES BUT IN THE

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.128
SUBSEQUENT TWENTY YEARS A LOT

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:30.229
HAS HAPPENED WE'VE LEARNED A LOT

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:31.563
ABOUT CANNABINOIDS INTO

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.132
CANNABINOIDS THE TYPES OF

00:15:33.198 --> 00:15:35.200
PRODUCTS THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL --

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:37.403
BUT WE CAN'T STUDY MOST OF THOSE

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:39.772
BECAUSE OF VARIOUS IMITATIONS

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:41.473
AND APART WE ONLY GET.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.275
OUR PLANT MATERIAL FROM BAIDOA.

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:45.010
US THE ONLY SOURCE AND ONE OF

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:47.146
THE THE GOALS OF THIS IS

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:48.981
ULTIMATELY SPECIALLY WITH

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:49.615
FEDERAL WHEN FEDERAL APPROVALS

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:50.883
COME THROUGH THAT WE CAN WORK

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:52.518
WITH EITHER INDUSTRY ARE WITH

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:54.853
OTHER UNIVERSITIES. TO DEVELOPED

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.355
CANNABIS PLANTS THAT MIGHT BE OF

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:57.890
INTEREST MEDICINALLY.

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.258
OFFER VARIOUS CONDITIONS.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:01.727
ANOTHER LIMITATION THAT WE FACE

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.762
IS THAT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:07.800
SOURCES OF KIND OF CANNABINOIDS --

00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:08.534
IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT CERTAIN

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.435
CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:10.636
STUDY GOING TO LOOK AT AUTISM.

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:11.904
BUT WE HAVE TO GO TO A SPECIFIC

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.107
SOURCE TO FIND CBT THAT DOESN'T

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:16.342
HAVE TÁEEN AS A TNC IS THE

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:17.343
PSYCHOACTIVE COMPONENT.

00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:18.877
OBVIOUSLY WE DO NOT WANT TO GET

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:21.480
KIDS STONED AND HIGH -- SO THIS

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:23.148
ALSO ENABLES US TO BE LOOKING AT

00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:25.417
THESE SYNTHETIC CANNABINOIDS IN

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.885
THE INTEREST OF SAFETY AND DOING

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:28.320
CLINICAL STUDIES TO UNDERSTAND

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:29.521
HOW CANNABIS AND ITS

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:33.826
CONSTITUENTS MIGHT AFFECT.

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:35.461
OUR PERFORMANCE.

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:37.463
AND THEN I'LL JUST ALSO THROW IN

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:39.732
THAT -- WE DO STUDY ALSO LOOK AT

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:40.699
PUBLIC SAFETY I DO DRIVING

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.067
RESEARCH AND SO FORTH IMPACT OF

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:43.936
OF CANNABIS -- AND RIGHT NOW

00:16:44.002 --> 00:16:44.603
WE'RE LIMITED BY BEING ABLE TO

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.505
ACCESS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN.

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:46.972
THE CANVAS THIS BEING

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:49.174
DISTRIBUTED TO THE PUBLIC -- AND

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:50.342
THIS WILL ENABLE US ALSO TO

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:51.710
ALTERNATELY LOOK AT THOSE

00:16:51.777 --> 00:16:53.512
MATERIALS AS WELL.

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.513

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:48.033
RELATED -- THE ISSUE.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:48.667
WELL I THINK TERMS A MEDICINAL

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.102

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:55.574
NUMEROUS CLAIMS BEING MADE ABOUT

RATE OF WILL AIDS.

00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:14.460
TO AT THE OUR VARIOUS OF LIGHT

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:15.360

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:42.033
ELIGIBILITY BUT THEY COULDN'T

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:42.834
COME TO THE COULDN'T COMEBACK

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:43.701
SCHOOL AND THEY DIDN'T GET

00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:45.703
DRAFTED AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:47.171
THOUGHT THAT WAS UNFAIR.

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:50.408
AND THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM TO

00:31:50.475 --> 00:31:52.677
SEE IF THEY CAN GET -- FOR THIS

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:54.646
VERY ELITE CADRE OF BASKETBALL

00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:57.081
PLAYERS -- DEBILITY TO COME TO

00:31:57.148 --> 00:32:00.251
THE COMBINE TO TO TRY OUT -- IN

00:32:00.318 --> 00:32:02.153
ORDER TO DO SO YOU NEED TO BE

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.391
DECLARED A LEAD BY THE THE NBA

00:32:06.457 --> 00:32:08.926
COMMITTEE SO -- LIKELY HAS THIS

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:10.261
QUESTION THAT -- SO THE NC

00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:12.397
DOUBLE A HAS MADE THIS RULE

00:32:12.463 --> 00:32:15.066
CHANGE FOR A VERY NARROW GROUP

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:20.538
OF ATHLETES -- IS.

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:22.340
SO WHEN -- I GUESS ARE THE

00:32:22.407 --> 00:32:25.176
UNIVERSITIES IN FAVOR OF AND YOU

00:32:25.243 --> 00:32:26.978
SAID I HEARD WERE PILOT.

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:28.613
ARE THEY IN FAVOR THIS POLICY

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.715
BEING APPLIED MORE GENERALLY

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:33.284
EVENTUALLY TO ALL ATHLETES.

00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:35.353
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.688
REASON THAT IT'SHAPPENING RIGHT

00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:39.090
NOW IN BASKETBALL IS DRIVEN BY

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:41.225
THE NBA'S ROLES ON RECRUITMENT

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:43.361
WHICH IS HOW COME I STARTED WITH

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:45.496
THE ONE AND ROLE -- THE THE

00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:46.597
RECRUITMENT INTO THE

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:48.032
PROFESSIONAL RANKS IS ACTUALLY

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:50.501
DRIVEN BY THE PROFESSIONALRANKS

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:53.471
AND SO -- FOR INSTANCE BASEBALL

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:54.272
PLAYERS ARE ALLOWED TO BE

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:57.075
RECRUITED -- BECAUSE THE THE

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:58.843
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL SYSTEM HAS

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.145
THE FARM TEAMS -- THEY ALREADY

00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:03.314
ARE ALLOWED UNDER THE EXISTING

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:04.449
INTO DOUBLE A RULES TO HAVE

00:33:04.515 --> 00:33:09.187
AGENTS AND TO TO BE PART OF THAT --

00:33:09.253 --> 00:33:12.423
THE NBA IS -- RATHER UNIQUE IN

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.126
THAT THEY ALSO -- THEY HAVE THIS

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:17.929
RULE -- THE W. A. B. A. ALSO HAS

00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:19.297
A A RULE SO THEY ARE CONSIDERING

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:21.366
EXPANDING IT RIGHT NOW TO THE W.

00:33:21.432 --> 00:33:23.134
NBA AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT A

00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:24.969
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT SPORTS WHERE

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:28.139
THE PROFESSIONAL SPORTS FOLK.

00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:29.407
ARE ALLOWING -- COLLEGIATE

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:32.043
ATHLETES TO TO JOIN THE RANKS

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.511
WERE TO JUMP FROM HIGH SCHOOL

00:33:33.578 --> 00:33:37.482
STREET IN LIKE THE NBA'S DOES

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:38.516
ALLOW PEOPLE.

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:41.252
SO THAT'S THE THE THE GENESIS OF

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:43.388
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO NARROW IS.

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:44.422
LIKE I SAID IT'S DRIVEN BY THE

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:45.723
THE NBA'S OR DO YOU THINK THIS

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:46.324
IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:47.225
STUDENTS.

00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:47.859
YES OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T BE

00:33:47.925 --> 00:33:48.826
ABLE.

00:33:48.893 --> 00:33:50.628
TO RETURN TO THEIR INSTITUTIONS

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:53.097
WERE THEY NOT DRAFTED.

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:55.266
OKAY SO SO THEN IF THIS IS THE

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:56.834
BEST AND I REALIZE SOMEONE'S HAS

00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:57.935
TO DO WITH THAT.

00:33:58.002 --> 00:34:00.471
BUT OTHER PROFESSIONAL.

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:01.739
THE X. DO IT BUT THEN THEN YOU

00:34:01.806 --> 00:34:03.508
ARE IN FAVOR OF DOING THIS MORE

00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:06.310
BROADLY.

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:08.012
FOR YES SIR AND THE LANGUAGE IS

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:10.548
ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN A WAY TO NOT

00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:12.717
EXPRESSLY CONFORM TO ONLY THIS

00:34:12.784 --> 00:34:14.352
ONE RULE CHANGE BUT WE RODE IT

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:16.521
SO THAT WE COULD ALLOW AS THE NC

00:34:16.587 --> 00:34:18.222
DOUBLE A EXPANDS.

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:19.624
THEIR PROGRAM THE LAW IS NOT

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.993
GOING TO HAVE TO BE REVISITED

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:24.262
EACH TIME YOU ADAM BOARD AND

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:26.364
I'VE LET ME ASK -- POLLUTANTS

FAIR FOR YOU ALONE BUT TO

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.251
ACTUALLY A PUSH FOR THE

00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:48.386
APPROPRIATE CHANGES AT NC DOUBLE

UNIVERSITY THEMSELVES.

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:56.828
ARE NOT BEING STRONG ENOUGH

00:34:56.894 --> 00:34:58.529
ADVOCATES FOR THEIR OWN STUDENTS

00:34:58.596 --> 00:34:59.597
AND SINCE THE S. INTERESTING

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:00.565
YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOR AN

00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:01.499
ORGANIZATION THAT YOU ACTUALLY

WHERE YOU'RE NOT JUST USC BUT

00:35:07.104 --> 00:35:07.605
OTHER CALIFORNIA COLLEGES

00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:09.640
UNIVERSITIES STANDING TOGETHER

00:35:09.707 --> 00:35:10.408

ARE IN SENATE EDUCATION.

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:20.184
AND SO I KNOW OUR TIME HERE IS

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:22.153
IN FOCUSED ON THE LARGER

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:22.787
DISCUSSION WITH INTO DOUBLING

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:23.955
GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS BILL BUT I

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:27.425
CAN ASSURE YOU THAT.

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:31.395
WE ARE -- ADVOCATING FOR REFORMS

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:32.129
ON BEHALF OF OUR STUDENT

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:33.531
ATHLETES REGULARLY YET I THOUGHT

00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:34.165
I GUESS SO YEAH I GUESS WHAT I

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:35.233
WOULD SAY IS IS THAT.

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:36.067
I DON'T WANT TO JUST DO BILLS

00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:37.602
CONFORM WITH THE NC DOUBLE A I

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:38.469
WANT US TO THINK HERE ART IN

00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:40.037
THIS LEGISLATURE ABOUT WHAT'S

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:42.039
BEST FOR STUDENTS.

00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:43.174
AND NOT JUST DO THINGS BECAUSE

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:45.676
AND TWO OF THEM EXCHANGED WORDS

00:35:45.743 --> 00:35:46.711
CAN CONFORM TO THAT.

00:35:46.777 --> 00:35:49.146
ANDERSON YEAH OKAY.

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:50.481
RIGHT THANK YOU YEAH ANY OTHER

00:35:50.548 --> 00:35:51.415
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:53.150
MEMBERS.

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:54.652
THAT ARCHULETA SIGNATURE.

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:55.853
I WAS IN THE IMPRESSION THAT

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.921
PERHAPS SOME OF THIS WORD THAT

00:35:56.988 --> 00:36:00.191
THISINCLUDED WOMEN AS WELL.

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:02.360
AND I WAS ALSO THE IMPRESSION IT

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:04.629
INCLUDED ALL SPORTS AS WELL.

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:07.098
SO I SEE THAT ALL SPORTS ARE

00:36:07.164 --> 00:36:08.699
LEFT OUT AND CERTAINLY WOMEN ARE

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:10.568
BEING DISCRIMINATED BECAUSE WE

00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:12.169
HAVE THE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:14.705
PROFESSIONAL LEAGUE -- AND THEY

00:36:14.772 --> 00:36:16.374
TOO ARE RECRUITED.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.543
SHOW I I SEE THAT THERE ARE YOU

00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:19.710
LEADING IN THAT DIRECTION THAT'S

00:36:19.777 --> 00:36:20.978
WHY YOU CALL IN A PILOT PROGRAM

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:22.179
I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT IT DOWN.

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:23.714
BECAUSE I WANT TO SAY THIS IS

00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:25.483
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WOMEN.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.518
BUT IF IT'S A DOOR OPENER FOR

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:29.186
THE FUTURE AND THAT'S WHY THE

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:32.223
PILOT THEN I CAN CONTINUE TO

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:33.491
SUPPORT.

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:37.328

00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:53.511
YOU KNOW AND AND TO NC DOUBLE A

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:55.279
RUSE.

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:58.382
THE IS REALLY DRIVEN BY THE

00:36:58.449 --> 00:36:59.684
HUNDRED WHAT TWENTIES COLLEGES

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:03.054
AND UNIVERSITIES.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.488
IN A SHOW WORK WERE WE'RE JUST

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:06.490
TRYING TO CONFORM WITH A AND C.

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:09.160
W. YOU HAVE ANYTHING.

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:09.827
TO IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:11.529
THEY ARE EXAMINING THE EXTENSION

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:12.163
TO THE WOMEN UNDER THE W. A. B.

00:37:12.229 --> 00:37:13.264
AS WELL BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW THE

00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:15.032
SAME CONTRACT.

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:15.866
SO THAT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:17.201
YES SIR.

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:19.604
AND ALONG THIS PATH WITH THESE --

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.606
STUDENT ATHLETES BE RECEIVING

00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:26.410
FUNDING MONIES -- PAYCHECKS BY

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:27.011
ANYWAYS.

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.312
FORM IN ADVANCE OF THEIR

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:31.482
FUTURISTIC PLAY.

00:37:31.549 --> 00:37:33.985
YEAH THIS BILL ALLOWS THEM TO

00:37:34.051 --> 00:37:37.421
HIRE AGENTS AND ALLOWS THE

00:37:37.488 --> 00:37:40.591
AGENTS TO EXPEND MONEY -- IN THE

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:42.326
RECRUITMENT PROCESS IT'S VERY

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:44.829
NARROW IT IT DOESN'T GET INTO

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:47.598
THE CONTRACTS THAT THE AGENTS

00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:48.633
WILL THEN SIGN ON THE HALF OF

00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:50.768
THE STUDENT ATHLETES AND THIS

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:53.738
DOES NOT -- ALLOW THE STUDENT

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:56.340
ATHLETES TO BECOME PROFESSIONALS

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:59.143
AS THEY MAINTAIN THEIR AMATEUR

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.412
STATUS SO IF THE START GETTING

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:05.549
PAID. TO PERFORM ATHLETICALLY --

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:07.952
THAT'S ANOTHER BILL.

00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:08.786
AND AND AND THAT IS OUTSIDE THE

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:10.621
SCOPE OF THIS BILL THIS BILL

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:13.691
MERELY ALLOWS THEM. TO OBTAIN

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:15.693
THE SERVICE AGENTS AND IT ALLOWS

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.696
THE AGENTS TO EXPAND TO MINIMUS

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:21.565
AMOUNTS TRAVEL PART OF THE THE

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:23.501
ENTICEMENT TO SIGN WITH THE

00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:24.568
AGENCY.

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:28.339
FOOD -- ASSOCIATED WITH -- WITH

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:29.774
THE CONTRACT SOLICITATIONS SO

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.977
IT'S IT'S NOT EXACTLY -- WITHIN

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:34.445
THE THE SCOPE OF US TO TO TALK

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:40.284
ABOUT THE THE PROFESSIONALISM.
