ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR LEVINE. OUR SYSTEM YEAH I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU AS WELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO FOR- FOR OFFERING THIS LEGISLATION- THANK YOU ALSO TO GOVERNOR BROWN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS- WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION GLOBALLY BECAUSE OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S LEADERSHIP AND THE SUBNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AND REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS THAT GOVERNOR BROWN FOR JUST AS AS GOVERNOR. OF CALIFORNIA. WE LIKE TO THINK OF OURSELVES RIGHTLY SO AS A MY ID ECONOMIC POWER BUT ALSO. A MIGHTY VALUES DRIVEN POWER. AND SO WHILE I ONE OF MY FONDEST MEMORIES ARE OF GOVERNOR BROWN IS AN INTERACTION WITH THAT WITH MY WIFE AND ME WHEN MY WIFE ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO IN RETIREMENT HE SAID WELL I'M GOING TO SOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND- TAKE ON YOU KNOW NUCLEAR WAR- AND JUST OKAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BUSY RETIREMENT SO- A LOT OF RESPECT FOR. EIGHTY NOT I WOULD EVEN DESCRIBE IT AS A SECOND CAREER. JUST A VERY- ANOTHER CAREER. IN A LONG LINE OF TACKLING SOME OF OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS. AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT PROBABLY THE GREATEST THREAT. THAT HUMANITY HAS EVER FACED- ON ON PAR WITH NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION. AND AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT- THAT BROWN IS PUTTING HIS ENERGIES TOWARD THAT AND THAT YOU SEE. IS ABLE TO CONTINUE- PARTNERING WITH THOSE WHO CAN DO THE VERY MOST. TO LIMIT THE THREAT. OF THE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND THAT. ABSOLUTELY MUST INCLUDE CHINA. IF WE'RE NOT LOOKING TOWARD CHINA AS A PLACE FOR SOLUTIONS TO OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE WOULD BE LOOKING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION CHINA MUST BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION- IN CHINA AS AN AMAZING PLACE AN AMAZING CULTURE. AN AMAZING ECONOMIC POWER- NYTHING PEOPLE PLACE I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO VISIT. MY CHILDREN STUDY MANDARIN IN SCHOOL I FIRMLY BELIEVE CHINA IS PART OF CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. AND SO. I KNOW THAT THIS CLIMATE WORKING CONTINUE WITHOUT THIS LEGISLATION. AND AND I STRUGGLE WITH THIS LEGISLATION NOT BECAUSE OF THE THREAT THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS- CONFRONTS US WITH. BUT BECAUSE OF OTHER ISSUES HAPPENING INSIDE CHINA'S BORDERS RIGHT NOW. THAT CANNOT GO UNNOTICED THAT WE KNOW ABOUT. THAT WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THAT SECRETARY OF STATE TONY BLINKEN REFERRED TO AS GENOCIDE JUST THIS WEEK- IN REFERENCE TO CHINA'S TREATMENTS OF THE UIGHUR MUSLIMS. SO WE CAN'T JUST ACT LIKE EVERYTHING IS NORMAL WHEN WE ARE ENGAGING WITH CHINA EVEN ON EXISTENTIAL THREATS. WHEN WE KNOW. THAT REALLY BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING INSIDE CHINA. AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT WOULD OCCUR DURING A DIFFERENT VERY CHALLENGING TIME FOR ALL THE PEOPLE ON OUR PLANET. DURING THE GLOBAL DEPRESSION DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF THE THIRTIES. IF CALIFORNIA OR THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER. ANOTHER MIGHTY ECONOMIC POWER THOUGHT. GERMANY IS THE LINCHPIN OF GETTING HUMANITY OUT OF THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS. IMAGINE THIS BEING POST KRISTALLNACHT MAYBE PRE DEATH COUNT TERMINATE. AND WE SAID WE CAN PULL THE WHOLE GLOBE OUT OF THIS. SO LET'S HAVE STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS WITH GERMANY. WELL WE KNEW THAT INTERMENT CAMPS CONCENTRATION CAMPS WERE GOING ON. WHICH THEY PROBABLY DID. BUT PEOPLE WENT ALONG. AND NO ONE IN A DISTANT CAPITAL- THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE MIGHTY ARE POWERFUL. NEVER RECONCILED THAT THIS IS GOING ON INSIDE THAT COUNTRY INSIDE GERMANY IMAGINE WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE. IT PROBABLY HAPPENED. SO HERE WE ARE A CENTURY LATER. AND WE KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE FIFTH MIGHTIEST ECONOMIC POWER IN THE WORLD WE LIKE TO CALL OURSELVES KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TORN FROM THEIR HOMES THEIR FAMILIES THEIR LANGUAGE THEIR CULTURE THEIR FAITH. PLACED IN CAMPS. AND WE. ARE GOING TO ACT LIKE IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL. AND CODIFY PARTNERSHIP THAT'S JUST ALREADY TAKING PLACE ANYWAY. WITHOUT RECOGNITION. THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO MILLIONS OF OUR FELLOW MEMBERS OF HUMANITY. SO IT'S NOT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND HOW WE RECONCILE THAT. AND HOW WE PARTNER WITH CHINA. HELLO PASSED BILLS AND LEGISLATION THAT MAKE REFERENCE TO CHINA. AND THIS IS A. AND IT'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE I FULLY RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT THREAT THAT CLIMATE CHANGES. IT'S NOT WORTH. CASTING ASIDE. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO A PART OF HUMANITY IN CHINA WHEN WE DO THIS SO AS THIS BILL IS FOR IT I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE I'M ABLE TO STOP THIS BILL. AND I. TELL THE AUTHOR THAT THAT WASN'T MY INTENTION WHEN I. TOLD HIM I NEEDED TO RAISE THESE ISSUES. AB ALTHOUGH I DO NEED TO VOTE NO. BUT THAT WE NEED TO RECONCILE THIS AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS LEGISLATION AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH HOW CALIFORNIA IF WE THINK THAT WE ARE THE LEADERS OF THE WORLD BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND VALUES WISE. DEALS WITH THESE TYPES OF ISSUES THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER JOY. THANK YOU ARE THERE ARE- FOR PRESENTING THIS- IMPORT ON. CLIMB AT THE ISSUE I UNDERSTAND A OF CALIFORNIA CHINA CLIMATE THE INSTITUTE IS ALREADY IN PLACE. AND- NOW THIS BILL IS- TRYING TO- MANDATE. I WANT THREE FOUR LEGISLATURE- OPTION PLEASE SEND US SUCH A MANDATE ON THE UC SYSTEM. AND THE FOR THEM TO OUR PERMANENTLY HAVE A SISTER INSTITUTION IN PLACE TO AND THE DATA ONCE WE- REQUIRE THEM- THE FUNDING WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW- AND- ATOMIC FREEDOM MAY BE INFRINGED I THAT SHOULD BE- LEFT TO- THE UNIVERSITY- IS OUT. HOW TO- I. THERE JUST ON. INSTITUTE AND OF BASED UPON THIS OFFER ON FORTY OUR. SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THE MISTER BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR VICE CHAIR- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- AND- I RESPECT VERY MUCH THE COMMENTS- MADE BY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTH SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA- BUT I REACHED THE OPPOSITE CONCLUSION WHILE HOLDING. UP VERY MUCH THE SAME BELIEFS ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINESE- THE OUTRAGEOUS AND DISGUSTING BEHAVIOUR OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE MUSLIM UIGHUR PEOPLE. WITHIN ITS BORDERS- BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT. IT'S THE CRACKDOWN ON DEMOCRACY IN HONG KONG THAT TO CAUSES ME TO BE OUTRAGED IT'S CHINESE INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS THAT CAUSES ME TO BE OUTRAGED BUT IN SPITE OF ALL OF THESE THINGS. THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND SO OVERRIDING THAT- I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION THAT FOLLOWS. BY EXTENDING THESE BONDS BETWEEN THE CHINESE PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AS REPRESENTED THROUGH OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS WE ALSO MAINTAIN IMPORTANT BONDS THAT HOPEFULLY WILL UNDERMINE THESE ANTI DEMOCRATIC. AND OTHER OUTRAGES THAT WE SEE BEING PERPETRATED BY THE GOVERNMENT. AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EVERYONE'S I VOTE ON- ON THIS BILL BECAUSE OUR CLIMATE CRISIS IS EVERYTHING TO THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY TO CHINA TO EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND EVERY PERSON WHO LIVES NOW. AND WILL COME INTO THIS WORLD IN THE FUTURE THAT'S HOW BROAD AND HOW IMPORTANT THIS CRISIS AS. YEAH WE HAVE A THE FIRST IS IT IS OUR SECOND YEAH WELCOME TO GO BACK TO MISTER RIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION- MISTER GAVE A. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES I- I'VE WRESTLED WITH SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES AS- OUR COLLEAGUES FROM MARIN COUNTY SANTA MONICA- ALSO BELIEVE VERY FIRMLY THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT THAT MULTILATERAL DIALOGUE PARTICULARLY WITH CHINA AS A CENTRAL TO SOLVING THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT THAT THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE PART OF THAT DIALOGUE AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT IT AND YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN ISSUE HIGHER ON OUR PRIORITY LIST THEN CLIMATE CHANGE IN DEALING WITH WITH THE CHINESE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. BUT I ALSO WRESTLED WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES THERE AND PARTICULARLY THE ISSUE THE UIGHURS- AND THAT'S SOMETHING I WAS FORTUNATE OUR OUR GOVERNOR FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN CALLED ME LAST NIGHT WE SPOKE FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES ABOUT THIS AND HAD A VERY- ROBUST CONVERSATION WHICH I APPRECIATED VERY MUCH AND WAS. WAS ULTIMATELY PERSUADED THAT THERE ARE. OTHER AVENUES IN WHICH WE CAN RAISE THAT AND I THINK WE SHOULD I THINK WE NEED TO AS A- OUR COLLEAGUE SAID NEVER TAKE OUR VALUES OFF THE TABLE. WE NEED TO HAVE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS INCLUDING WITH OUR ALLIES AND FRIENDS. AND THE ISSUES OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE PARAMOUNT AND I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SPEAK TO THOSE PARTICULARLY. WHEN THEY REACH A CERTAIN LEVEL AND THE LEVEL THAT ARE- AND AS WAS MENTIONED BY OUR COLLEAGUE WHERE SECRETARY OF STATE. UNDER SECRETARY STATUS DESCRIBE THIS AS A GENOCIDE THAT IS NOT A TERM THAT PEOPLE TAKE LIGHTLY. THAT'S NOT A TERM THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE EMPLOYEES LIGHTLY. SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT URGENT MATTER FOR US TO ADDRESS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT ISN'T URGENT EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO ALL HUMANITY SO I'M PERSUADED TODAY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- FOR THE WORK IN AND FOR STRENGTHENING THAT PARTNERSHIP AND I I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT IN DIPLOMACY YOU CAN HAVE. CONVERSATIONS ON MULTIPLE TRACKS AND YOU CAN WORK ON AREAS WHERE YOU AGREE AND AREAS WHERE YOU DISAGREE AND SO I HOPE THAT WE WILL. CONTINUE TO HAVE FRUITFUL EXCHANGES WITH. THE CHINESE AND WITH WITH WITH GOVERNMENTS AND PARTNERS ALL OVER THE WORLD ABOUT HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO COMBAT. THE COMMON THREAD OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE FACE. AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE FRANK AND OPEN AND HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- BUT JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE. TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ON THESE ISSUES GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU MR GAVE. ANY OTHER. MR BERMAN. THANK YOU GERMANY IN A AND- I'M ONLY SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE TODAY SIR APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR PATIENCE BUT WE JUST WANT TO FRANKLY- ALLOW MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF ALL MY COLLEAGUES FROM- MARIN FROM SANTA MONICA TO THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY- I'LL BE VOTING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT BUT I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE- RAISE OUR VOICE- IN SUPPORT OF THE WE ARE MUSLIMS- AND IN OPPOSITION OF WHAT IS NOW BEEN TURNED GENOCIDE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM- AND IN THEIR- INTERMENT CAMPS IN THIS REGION PROVINCE AND- YOU KNOW AS IT WE HAD A- PRESENTATION IN THE JEWISH CAUCUS ABOUT THIS. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING- TO OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN IN HUMANITY- AND WELL I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SPEAK UP WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AND I THINK WHAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH WITH THIS PARTNERSHIP TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IS SUCH AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SPEAK UP- AND SPEAK OUT AGAINST INJUSTICES THAT WE KNOW ARE HAPPENING- YOU KNOW EVEN IN THE COUNTRIES- IN YOU KNOW WHERE WE MIGHT BE ALSO PARTNER PARTNERING ON. ON TACKLING- OTHER- EXISTENTIAL CRISIS SO- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT BUT I REALLY TINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SPEAK OUT AGAINST WHAT'S HAPPENING- TO HUMANS IN CHINA TO IT- WE ARE MUSLIMS IN CHINA- AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT WE TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO STATE THAT THOSE ARE NOT OUR VALUES THOSE ARE NOT THINGS THAT WE STAND IN SUPPORT OF- AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE DEMAND- THAT THAT EVERY COUNTRY. IN THE WORLD STOP IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU. THERE YOU MR BERMAN. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CALL FROM THE- DOES THE AUTHOR OF MAY THAT'S ANY DOES THE OTHER ONE TO MAKE IT.

I WILL WE WEREN'T ABLE T PROCEED WITH IT AND WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A MADE BY THE INSTITUTE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS ALL ALWAYS AT THE FOREFRONT WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT LEADERSHIP. AND TO- MY COLLEAGUE FROM US IN MARIN I THINK- WE COUNTY AND I IDEA ME PER FACE YOU IF I MAY AND YOU SAID THAT CHINA MUST BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH. THAT AND I THINK THAT- IN CALIFORNIA HAS TO BUILD. A PUNISH. WITH EVERYBODY WHO COULD REDUCE THIS. OF YOU KNOW THIS IS SUCH A- NOW I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU ALSO. I WAS BORN IN HONG KONG AND- YOU KNOW YOU ALL KNOW WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN HONG KONG. ALSO DISAGREE WITH A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING. BUT I'D YOU KNOW WANTED TO ISOLATE. MYSELF FROM A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT I CANNOT CONTROL. BUT YET. I WANTED TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING THAT I COULD CONTROL. AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY FOCUS IN ON. AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED FACT THAT CHINA IS A BIG EMITTER. OF- CLOUT THESE ARE THE KIND OF POLLUTION. AND IMAGES THEIR SHARE WITH YOU INTO. EIGHTEEN CHINA ADMITTED TEN BILLION. METRIC TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE. AND JUST IN ONE YEAR ALONE IN CALIFORNIA WE WERE AT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. AND YES I THINK. IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF BOTH PARTIES TO. WORK TO WHAT REDUCING THAT. NUMBER I THINK. WHEN AND- WHEN THE GOES DOWN TO. BENEFITS CAL. CHINA AND ALSO MANY OF THE NEIGHBORING. STATES AND ALSO NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES SO THIS IS SOME SOME KIND OF A- WIN WIN SITUATION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. WE CAN AND SHOULD WORK WITH CHINA ON ON SO SAID THAT IS THE FOCUS ON A YOU KNOW OF MY BILL. SO SO WITH THAT I WANTED TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I IT'S BEEN.

TWO EIGHT EIGHT FOR MR BONTA. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA TO PRESENT AB TWO EIGHT EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA BAN ON SCHOLARSHIP DISPLACEMENT. WHICH WOULD INCREASE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION BY PREVENTING COLLEGES FROM REDUCING FINANCIAL AID AWARDS IF A STUDENT ELIGIBLE FOR THE PELL GRANTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT IS ALSO AWARDED A PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIP. WE ALL KNOW THIS MANY PARTICULAR THAT A DEGREE AS EXPENSIVE. AND STUDENTS STRUGGLE EVERY DAY TO MAKE ENDS MEET. EVEN WITH STUDENT DEBT AWARDS MANY STILL HAVE FINANCIAL NEED AND WORK EXTREMELY HARD TO EARN OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS. IN SOME CASES STUDENTS ARE UNABLE TO MAKE FULL USE OF AWARDS GIVEN BY PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIP PROVIDERS BECAUSE COLLEGES CAN REDUCE THEIR FINANCIAL AID. WHICH THOSE STUDENTS WOULD OTHERWISE BE QUALIFIED TO RECEIVE. THIS COMMON PRACTICE OF REDUCING FINANCIAL AID AWARDS DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS IS REFERRED TO. AS SCHOLARSHIP pSTRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS WE MUST NOT PUNISH THOSE WHO ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO RECEIVE A PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIP. SCHOLARSHIP DISPLACEMENT CREATES AN EVEN GREATER FINANCIAL BURDEN ON STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHO MAY NOT HAVE OTHER MEANS TO PAY. FOR NON TUITION COSTS OF COLLEGE BOOKS FOOD HOUSING TRANSPORTATION. THE REAL COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE IS MUCH MORE THAN THE TUITION AND FEES. AND IT TENDS TO BE MUCH HIGHER THAN TYPICAL FINANCIAL AID AWARDS. A SMALL SCHOLARSHIP MEANS THE BIG DIFFERENCE. KEEP STUDENTS ON TRACK TO GRADUATE INSTANCE INSTEAD OF BEING FORCED TO DROP OUT. HEARING SCHOLARSHIP. IS IMPORTANT. IN ANY EQUITY FOCUSED COLLEGE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF COVER NINETEEN. AS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESOURCES ARE BECOMING EVEN MORE LIMITED FOR STUDENTS. THIS BILL WOULD BRING US ONE STEP CLOSER TO EQUITY ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES. AND HELP OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS ACHIEVE THEIR DREAM OF EARNING A COLLEGE DEGREE AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO A WITNESSES.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- AND I JUST WANTED TO- SORT OF RACE IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A QUESTION AND A COMMENT AND- I KNOW WE HAVE OUR COLLEAGUE- YOU KNOW HE'S BEING OUT OF LOYALTY MASON KIDDING SELF NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT HE'S- AMONG OUR MOST ACCOMPLISHED AND INTELLIGENT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S GOT THE ANSWER TO THIS ONE M. YEAH JUST BECAUSE HE SOMETHING AND QUITE ONE THING THAT OCCURRED TO ME AND MY STAFF AS WE WERE LOOKING AT THE BILL WISE- YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL HOW MUCH WE SUPPORT THE PURPOSE OF IT- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL HOW MUCH WE UNDER FUND- PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE STATE. AND HOW LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY OF SOME OF THE WITNESSES ABOUT HOW THEY STRUGGLE TO PUT THEMSELVES THROUGH SCHOOL I MEAN THAT IS NOT A SITUATION THAT ANY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE AND. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THAT FRONT. THAT I'M INSTEAD IS. I WAS LOOKING AT THE BILL I WAS TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND IS. IS THE PRACTICAL IMPACT OF THIS BILL GOING TO BE THAT IT CONCENTRATES RESOURCES. IN THE HANDS OF A- SMALL NUMBER STUDENTS RATHER THAN SPENDING THEM OUT MORE BROADLY. AND IS THAT GOING TO IMPACT. IN SOME WAYS OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS I ASSUME THAT OF THOSE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID- THAT. THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE- FROM THE- FROM THE MOST DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE GOING TO BE LEAST LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS- PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIP THEY MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THAT. AND SO- YOU KNOW THIS THIS IS YOUR SCHOLARSHIP DISPLACEMENT UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING. AND WORRISOME FOR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO RECEIVE MULTIPLE SCHOLARSHIPS BUT IF WE CONCENTRATE. RESOURCES AND THEIR HANDS ARE WE LIMITING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING TO GET FINANCIAL AID AND THEN PERHAPS. INADVERTENTLY CLOSING THE DOORS. OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I IN AND- POTENTIALLY IS. IF I GUESS WHAT I'M HOPING TO HEAR FROM FROM FOLKS WHO SUPPORT THE SPELL- IS. YOU KNOW ARE WE TAKING THAT DISCRETION AWAY FROM FROM FINANCIAL AID OFFICERS UNIVERSITIES YOU MIGHT LOOK AT THIS AND SAY WELL THE STUDENT HAS RECEIVED. A NUMBER OF PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS. NOT EVERYTHING I HOPE BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO GET THEM IN HERE AND I'D LIKE TO SHIFT SOME OF THAT LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. TO ANOTHER STUDENT WHO WON'T BE ABLE TO ATTEND THIS UNIVERSITY WITHOUT THOSE RESOURCES SO. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE- WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE THE OFFER IS NOT HERE AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT. THAT DESERVES TO CONTINUE- BUT EITHER. TODAY FROM SOME OF THE WITNESSES OR OR PERHAPS A THE FUTURE CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR- FOR MY GREAT RESPECT I I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT- ARE WE INADVERTENTLY. GOING TO BE SENDING SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. OUT OF HIGHER ED. BY CONCENTRATING RESOURCES. IN THE HANDS OF ELECTED YEAH. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS DOES. RESEARCH IF YOU WANT TO OKAY FINE I'LL GIVE A PARTIAL ANSWER TO THIS SO- FIRST OF ALL IN ONE THANKS COMMITTEE STAFFER POINTED OUT THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICERS DO NOT TAKE A POSITION ON THIS BILL NOR THE EXPRESS THAT PARTICULAR CONCERN AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR. AND HE'S OPEN TO THIS CONVERSATION ONE THING I'LL THE SEMI OWN BEHALF IS THIS PRACTICE HAS CREATED A VIRTUALLY DAY DISINCENTIVE FOR PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIP PROVIDERS BECAUSE IT. BASICALLY SENDS A SIGNAL THAT IF THEY'RE CONTRIBUTE THEIR DOLLARS THAT- THAT THEIR DOLLARS WILL BE USED TO BACKFILL INSTITUTIONAL EIGHT SO FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD I GIVE MR GABRIEL A SCHOLARSHIP IF THAT'S GONNA TAKE AWAY SOMETHING ELSE HE'S DOING SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE PROPERLY AND SENDING THOSE PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIP PROVIDERS TO DO WHAT THEY DO- BUT OBVIOUSLY I'VE LITERALLY JUST STEPPED IN TEN MINUTES AGO SO I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER PERSPECTIVES ON THIS AS WELL. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER MEDINA I PLEDGE MISTER WITH THAT THANK YOU- AND AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THAT THE MR BONTA IS NOT HERE TODAY I DID HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL- OF THE BUT ALSO. I HAVE BEEN MEMBER OF A NUMBER OF CLUBS THAT HAVE OFFERED THE SMALL SCHOLARSHIPS AND- TO STUDENTS AND THERE WAS ALWAYS A CONCERN. OR OR THERE WAS A REAL INTEREST IN WRITING THE CHECKS TO THE INSTITUTION FOR TUITION AND SO MY CONCERN WOULD BE IF CALIFORNIA NOW STEPS IN AND SAYS NO YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE CHECK TO THE STUDENT BECAUSE THE TUITION IS ALREADY BEING COVERED BY THE SCHOOL. I'M CONCERNED THAT YOU MIGHT LOSE A LOT OF- SMALL SCHOLARSHIP SO HAS HAS THAT- BEEN CONSIDERED OR DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHETHER IT'S BEEN CONSIDERED OR NOT. MOST DEMOCRATS. WHICH VERSION SHOULD GIVE I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THEM JUST CONFIRM WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND YOU KNOW WHAT AT NIGHT I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT I THINK THAT SOME OF THESE DETAILS NEED TO BE WORKED OUT YOU DON'T WANT IT AND THEN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT A LOT OF THESE SMALL PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIP- THAT- THAT A LOT. THE SMALL PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS END UP DISAPPEARING BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT WE DID HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE. AGAIN I'D APPRECIATE THAT WELL. TWO TWO. I APOLOGIZE I CAN ACTUALLY NOT ABLE TO RESIST- BUT BUT I'LL JUST I'LL JUST SAY AGAIN THAT STRANGE DISINCENTIVE TO THOSE CULTURE PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY PROVIDE A SCHOLARSHIP TO YOU- THAT THAT WILL END UP NOT INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF HELP THAT THE STUDENT GETS- BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT- THAT THAT- THE OFFERING COMMITTEE ARE AWARE OF THIS CONCERN AND- WILL CERTAINLY PASS IT ON TO MR BONTA TO ADDRESS THAT WITH YOU. IN THE COMING DAYS. AND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE- ST JUDE YOU WANNA MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT ADDRESS ON BEHALF ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. AND- THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRING UP- CONCERNS AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT YOU KNOW HAVING HAD A DAUGHTER. IN COLLEGE WHO DID RECEIVE SCHOLARSHIPS- AND THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO. TO TAKE EVERY DOLLAR THAT SHE WAS OFFERED IN SCHOLARSHIP MONEY. AND THE INSTITUTION A PRIVATE INSTITUTION WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO DOUBLE IT. YOU KNOW. SOME CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE HEARD BY- THE PRACTICE OF TAKING AWAY MANY. WHEN THEY RECEIVED ADDITIONAL MONEY SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE- THE OTHER BRING IN THIS MEASURE FOR AND I THINK WE NEED TO ENSURE DO WHATEVER W CAN TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE ARE ABLETO RECEIVE EVERY ELIGIBLE DOLLAR FOR THE COLLEGES EXPENSES I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR A WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS IS NOTED ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS.

ENTER NON BINARY STUDENTS FACE MANY BARRIERS IN SCHOOL AND IN THE WORKPLACE IF A STUDENT DOESN'T HAVE AN UPDATED DIPLOMA OR TRANSCRIPT THEY CAN FACE CHALLENGES APPLYING FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL OR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. IT DIPLOMA IS A REPRESENTATION OF YEARS OF HARD WORK AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. IT SHOULDN'T COST STRESS OR EMOTIONAL HARM BY HAVING SOMEONE'S DEAD NAME ON IT DUE TO OUTDATED SCHOOL FALLS. AT THE PALM OF THAT HAS THE WRONG NAME CAN HAVE EFFECTIVE OUTING SOMEONE. WHO DOES NOT WISH TO BE ADDED OR MAY FEEL UNSAFE AND THEIR CURRENT SITUATION COMING OUT AS TRANSGENDER OR NON BINARY. THIS BILL DOES TWO THINGS IT ALLOWS TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY STUDENTS AT PUBLIC COLLEGES. TO HAVE THEIR CHOSEN NAME PRINTED ON THE DIPLOMA WHEN THEY GRADUATE. SECONDLY IT ALSO CREATES A STANDARD PROCESS FOR UPDATING STUDENT RECORDS OF FORMER STUDENTS. SO THAT THEIR NAME AND GENDER ACTUALLY REFLECT ON IMPORTANT RECORDS. THIS BILL BUILDS UPON A LAW THAT I OFFER IN TWENTY NINETEEN. TO MAKE SURE THAT FORMER K. TWELVE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO UPDATE STUDENT RECORDS TO MATCH THE CORRECT NAME AND SINCE THEN WE'VE HEARD FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS AND GRADUATES WHO FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES AND SUNNY TO EXTEND THIS POLICY TO PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. TRANSBOUNDARY PEOPLE FACED A LOT OF BARRIERS THE NAME OF THE% DIPLOMA.

ACCURATELY REFLECT THEIR LEGAL NAME AND GENDER REGARDLESS OF WHEN THEY GRADUATED THE BILL ALSO SPECIFIES THAT A GRADUATING STUDENT NAY EASILY HAVE THEIR CHOSEN NAMES LISTED ON THEIR DIPLOMA WHICH IS A CEREMONIAL BUT STILL PERSONALLY SIGNIFICANT DOCUMENT. I WOULD NEED RECORDS DON'T REFLECT THE CORRECT INFORMATION TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY STUDENTS WHO KNEW THE TRANSCRIPT FOR EXAMPLE TO APPLY FOR JOBS OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES I PUT AT RISK OF DISCRIMINATION OR HARM AT THE AUTHOR HAS JUST MENTIONED.

AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AMONG OTHER THINGS A BROUGHT UP IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT TO THEADMISSION BY EXCEPTION PROCESS WHICH ALLOWS THE US.

AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE REQUIRED THIS ADMISSION BY EXCEPTION CANDIDATES- TO BE REVIEWED BY. A PANEL OF- THREE SEED CAMPUS UP AND MISS. HOWEVER IT DID NOT DEFY WHO ON AT THE TEMPERS COULD OR COULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE ADMISSION BY EXCEPTION PROCESS.

Q- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY JUST WANTED TO ADD A COMMENT AND- YEAH I CERTAINLY THINK THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IS A GRADUATE OF UC BERKELEY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M PROUDEST OF IS THAT I CAN TELL PEOPLE THAT I WAS ADMITTED TO. THE UC SYSTEM NOT BECAUSE OF WHO MY FAMILY WAS OR ANYTHING ABOUT MY PERSONAL BIOGRAPHY OTHER THAN THAT I WORKED REALLY HARD IN COLLEGE AND SO I THINK THAT THAT THE- THE EMISSIONS SCANDAL CERTAINLY- A BLACK GUY FOR OUR TREASURE UC SYSTEM. THAT I'M INSIDE I JUST WANT TO ADD A FRIENDLY- DOSE OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT THIS BILL- I HOPE IT'S EXPECTED IN THAT MATTER THAT. I DIDN'T INCREDIBLY TONE DEAF FOR NEEDY INSTITUTIONS TO- YOU KNOW A TO A TO A SIGNED TODAY TO THE COMMITTEE ANY OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD BE. QUITE THAT QUITE THAT TURNED OUT TO DO THAT. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THERE IS AN INSTITUTION THAT IS INTENT ON GOING AROUND THE RULES THEN THE- HEAD OF FINANCIAL AID IS JUST GOING TO ASK WHOEVER'S ON THE IGNITION BY EXCEPTION COMMITTEE TO GO HAVE A DRINK AT THE UNIVERSITY CLUB TO TALK ABOUT IT. SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT EFFORT- BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT HAVING BEEN SAID I UNDERSTAND THE TAX I WILL BE VOTING FOR IT.

I'D FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF TO AMEND THE BILL TO WIDEN THE REQUIREMENTS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THIS AMENDMENT. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW CALFRESH IS A SUPPLEMENTARY NUTRITION ASSISTANCE BENEFIT PROGRAM ALLOCATED TO THE STATE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IS DISTRIBUTED TO ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS BY EACH COUNTY. THERE ARE MANY ADVANTAGES CAL FIRST ESPECIALLY FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS. WHO ARE SUPPORTING THEMSELVES THROUGH COLLEGE ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. EVEN WITH CURRENT LAWS THERE ARE STILL SO MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT ARE UNAWARE OF THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. AVAILABLE TO THEM WHICH IS WHY EIGHTY FIVE FORTY THREE IS SO IMPORTANT. ORIENTATION IS A ONE TIME FOR ALMOST ALL STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND. IT IS A PLACE FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN ABOUT THE COLLEGE AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM. WITH THE DATA THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED FROM THE THREE PUBLIC SYSTEMS IN THE STATE IT IS NOTED THAT THE PARTICIPATION RATE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS IS BETWEEN EIGHTY EXCUSE ME EIGHTEEN AT THIRTY PERCENT. LEAVING ESTIMATED ONE MILLION CALFRESH BENEFITS UNCLAIMED EVERY MONTH. KELLY STUDENTS ARE EITHER NOT RECEIVING ENOUGH INFORMATION OR UNAWARE OF THE BENEFITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. WITH THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY THE TABLE WE NEED TO SPREAD DISINFORMATION TO COLLEGES. SO THAT WE CAN PREVENT PRUDENT SECURITY FOR ALL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WILL ALLOW THEM. TO FOCUS ON THE EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL GOALS. AND ON A PERSONAL NOTE I CAN TELL YOU THAT. IF I WOULD HAVE THIS PROGRAM. WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY- IT WOULD BEEN VERY REASSURING. I CAME FROM WISCONSIN I DROVE OUT HERE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL- I WENT TO CAL STATE. LONG BEACH BUT I STARTED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN LONG BEACH. I WORKED TWO JOBS TO PAY FOR MY REFUSE TO PAY FOR MY RENT PAID FOR MY FOOD PAPER MY UTILITIES. I CAN TELL YOU THERE ARE TIMES WHERE BASICALLY I WASN'T SURE WHAT I WAS GOING TO EAT THE GOOD THING IS I'VE WORKED IN A RESTAURANT SO. I WAS TAKING CARE OF THOSE DAYS. HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU THAT- I BASICALLY ATE A LOT OF CAMPBELL SOUP. AND I HAD FRIENDS THAT- WOULD GIVE ME A CUDDLE SWITCHER WOULD MIX WITH MAYONNAISE AND PUT ON TOAST- NON THAT AVOCADO TOAST AND I WAS GOING FOR FIFTEEN DOLLARS A PIECE. SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT WAS IMPORTANT AND IN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO STUDENTS. AT THROUGHOUT THE- CALIFORNIA BUT SOME OF THEM- ARE LIVING IN A LIVING IN THEIR POWER TO TWENTY PUT THEMSELVES THROUGH SCHOOL RIGHT NOW. THE ONE COMMON DENOMINATOR WAS NOT ONE OF THEM KNEW ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S. AND THEY ALSO BOY WE CERTAINLY COULD HAVE USED IT SO HERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE EDUCATION UP TO THEM. AND UTILIZE THESE RESOURCES THAT ARE SITTING THERE. SO I MEMBERS OF AB FIVE FORTY THREE IT'S IMPORTANT BILL. THAT WOULD HELP OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS AT A MINIMAL COST BY OPENING THE DOOR. SO THAT SO MANY MORE BENEFITS THE STATE AND RESIDENTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ITEM ON THIS BIPARTISAN. SUPPORT OF LEGISLATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY. A DAVIS AT EIGHTEEN T.

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE WHICH OPENED UP ITS SECOND FOOD BANK RECENTLY THIS IS ONE SUCH A PRESSING ISSUE UNFORTUNATELY FOR SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS HERE I JUST WANT TO KNOW WE HAD A BILL THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW- TWO YEARS AGO THAT REQUIRES- INFORMATION ABOUT CALFRESH TO BE PLACED ON EVERY STUDENTS PORTAL- SO EVERY TIME THAT THEY SIGNED IN THEY CAN GET INFORMATION ABOUT IT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL THINGS WE CAN DO. IS DIRECT YOUNG PEOPLE TO- TO THAT INFORMATION BUT- I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO INCLUDED IN THE ORIENTATION- I JUST WANTED TO COMPLIMENT YOU THINK REALLY WEREN'T BILL. BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY.

OUR NEXT BILL IS EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX FILE ITEM NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN MAIENSCHEIN. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF MILITARY PERSONNEL. SAN DIEGO IS PROBABLY. ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACTIVE DUTY NAVY AND MARINE CORPS SERVICE MEMBERS SERVICE MEMBERS OFTEN TURN TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION OR JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS. IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO MILITARY MEMBERS COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE OFFERED COURSES HOSTED ON MILITARY BASES HOWEVER IN RECENT YEARS INCREASED SECURITY SCREENING IS GREATLY REDUCED ACCESS TO THESE CLASSES FOR STUDENTS. NOT LIVING ON BASE AND AS A RESULT MANY CLASSES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC. HIS CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO COLLECT APPORTIONMENT FOR CLASSES THAT ARE CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC THIS IS EFFECTIVELY LIMITED THE COURSE OFFERINGS AVAILABLE TO SERVICE MEMBERS. AB FIVE SEVEN SIX WOULD WAIVE THE OPEN COURSE PROVISIONS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSES PROVIDED TO ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL ON MILITARY BASES. THIS WOULD AUTHORIZE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS TO INCLUDE THE UNITS OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS GRADUATED IN THOSE CLASSES. FOR PURPOSES OF STATE APPORTIONMENT THE BILL AIMS TO ENSURE MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSES. THEY MAY NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ACCESS DUE TO WORK SCHEDULES FAMILY COMMITMENTS AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS.

AND THAT IS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND ON HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES THIS BILL WOULD ADD- MILITARY BASES TO THOSE EXCEPTIONS- THE EXCEPTIONS ARE GENERALLY FOR PRIVACY OR SAFETY OR SECURITY REASONS AND MILITARY BASES ARE NO DIFFERENT. THIS MEASURE WOULD OPEN UP ACCESS TO MILITARY PERSONNEL AND THEIR DEPENDENTS AND HELP THEM MOVE- MORE SWIFTLY INTO THE WORK FORCE- ONCE THEY COMPLETE THEIR COURSES SO REALLY APPRECIATE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND- ASPIRIN I BOTH THANK YOU.

AB TWO SEVENTY FIVE WOULD REDUCE THE MAXIMUM PROBATIONARY PERIOD FOR ALL CLASSIFIED COMMUNITY COLLEGE EMPLOYEES WORKING IN A NON MERIT DISTRICTS FROM ONE YEAR TO SIX MONTHS. FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY DAYS OF PAID SERVICE WHICHEVER IS LONGER. COMMUNITY COLLEGE MEMBERS WORKING IN NON MERIT DISTRICTS NEED PARITY WITH THOSE OF THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE MARRIAGE DISTRICT COUNTERPARTS. IN NON MERIT DISTRICTS CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES HAVE A PROBATIONARY PERIOD MAXIMUM OF ONE YEAR. BUT COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES WORKING IN MERRITT DISTRICTS ONLY HAVE A PROBATIONARY PERIOD MAXIMUM OF SIX MONTHS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF PROBATIONARY PERIODS FOR CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO PERFORM THE DUTIES OF THEIR POSITION. TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE EMPLOYER BEFORE GAINING MY PERMANENT STATUS INCLUDING DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. IF REPORTER PERFORMANCE EVALUATION PROCESS IS PROPERLY UTILIZE. A SIX MONTH PROBATIONARY PERIOD PROVIDES MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME FOR MANAGEMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN EMPLOYEE HAS MET. THE STANDARDS. BRINGING PARITY TO THE NON MERIT COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS WILL NOT COMPROMISE THE QUALITY OF THE WORK PERFORMED. TWO YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB THIRTEEN FIFTY THREE. THE REDUCE THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD FOR K. TWELVE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES WORKING IN NON MERIT DISTRICTS FROM ONE YEAR TO SIX MONTHS. IN ALIGNMENT WITH K.

MORE A COMMENT TEN EIGHT AND EXTENSION REALLY OF THE CONVERSATION THAT I THINK THAT THE CSU BEGAN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND THAT SOME OF OUR MID MEDINA BROUGHT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA IS A PLACE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS I REALLY RESPECTED THAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. TO DO THAT- IN THE CONVERSATION THAT WE ALL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AYE I'VE VOTED NO ON ON THE BILL PRIOR AND I WILL VOTE NO TODAY. NOT BECAUSE I DISAGREE WITH THE AUTHORS- INTENT- AND THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING A PIECE OF RICH AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE. BUT BECAUSE I DO YOU BELIEVE IN ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS ARE AN ARGUMENT THERE AND THAT THE CSU IS ACKNOWLEDGING IN IN CALIFORNIA THAT. COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE WOEFULLY IN ACTIN INADEQUATELY PREPARED. TO DO COLLEGE LEVEL WORK IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT THEY ARE SEEKING TO- IN IN- INDUCE. ARE SECONDARY SCHOOLS TO- TO BETTER PREPARE THEM BETTER EDUCATE STUDENTS SO THAT THEY CAN DO COLLEGE LEVEL WORK IN AND I APPLAUD THE CSU AND THEIR CHANGES TO THE REMEDIATION PROGRAM WHICH WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES ABOUT HOW THIS IS A BAR TO GRADUATION. THAT THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO HELP STUDENTS DO COLLEGE LEVEL WORK IN THERE AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF THINKING AT THE CSU BUT WE ALSO NEED TO CHALLENGE OUR HIGH SCHOOLS. TO DO- MUCH MORE AT TO PREPARE CHILDREN FOR IT PREPARE STUDENTS. FOR THE CRITICAL THINKING THAT MUST OCCUR- IN READING THE MOST CURRENT AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL SO THAT WE CAN HAVE. A STUDENTS IN- PREPARED AS THEY GRADUATE FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT- CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO. WRAP IT UP YEAH I JUST- TO MY COLLEAGUE I WOULD SAY IS. I DON'T DISAGREE- THE NEED FOR STUDENTS TO BE PREPARED TO DO COLLEGE WORK I THINK THE INTENT OF THE BILL.
