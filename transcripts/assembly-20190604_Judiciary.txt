COMMITTEE THIS IS TUESDAY JUNE FOURTH WE ARE A LITTLE BIT SHY OF A QUORUM. BUT WE WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE A COUPLE OF HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS. I UNDERSTAND THAT MR OBERNOLTE WILL NOT BE HERE TODAY. MR KILEY IS BEING REPLACED BY MR FONG. AND THEN ITEM NUMBER TWELVE SB SIX THIRTY HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CONSENT AGENDA SO WE WILL HEAR THAT ITEM [inaudible] SEEING. AUTHORS HERE WE HAVE A NUMBER SIGN IN BUT IN ORDER SENATOR HERTZBERG WE'LL START WITH. ITEM NUMBER TWO SB. FORTY ONE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. MORNING. YOU KNOW WE ALL OF INTRODUCED BILLS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND I'M INTRODUCED IN THIS BILL BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LAW WITH RESPECT. TO EQUITY IN CIVIL A DAMAGE AWARDS IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE GREGIS. FOR ME TO STORY. TWO YEARS AGO THE WASHINGTON POST RAN A STORY THE FOUR YEAR OLD BOY. A FOUR YEAR OLD BOY IN BROOKLYN WAS SUFFERING SEVERE NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE AFTER LIVING IN AN APARTMENT THAT WAS ILLEGALLY CODE WOULD LEAD PAINT. BOYS PARENTS SUE THE LANDLORD. AND IN THAT LITIGATION THE ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING THE BOY ESTIMATED THE SHOULD BE AWARDED THREE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT WAS THE ESTIMATE. THE AMOUNT HE WOULD HAVE EARNED OVER HIS LIFETIME. WITHOUT THE INJURY. BUT THE LANDLORDS DEFENSE TEAM AND THIS ACTUALLY IS A STATE OF THE LAW THE LANDLORDS DEFENSE TEAM CHARACTER THE BOYS DAMAGE AWARD TO BE LESS THAN HALF. AT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHY YOU MIGHT ASK. THE LANDLORDS ATTORNEY ARGUED THAT BECAUSE THE BOY WAS NOT THE NO. HE WAS UNLIKELY TO ATTAIN ADVANCED EDUCATION THAT WOULD GARNER THE LARGER INCOME THAT THE DEFENSE ESTIMATED HE COULD. THE CASE IS JUST ONE OF MANY CASES THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IF YOU COULD CALL IT THAT. THAT IS AN CITY IS IN A WIDESPREAD PRACTICE. IN THESE CASES JUDGES AND JURIES REALIZE WE'VE COME TO KNOW ON CALCULATION TABLES CALCULATION TABLES FROM FRENCH ECONOMIST AND I HAVE A VERY BRILLIANT FORENSIC ECONOMIST RIGHT HERE. THAT ARE USED TO PREDICT PLAINTIFFS LOST EARNINGS WAGES ON THE BASIS OF A MEMBERSHIP IN A PROTECTED CLASS. SUCH AS RACE OR GENDER. BECAUSE HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS SUCH AS AFRICAN AMERICANS WOMEN LATINOS EARN LESS ON AVERAGE IN THEIR WHITE MALE COUNTERPARTS FOR EXAMPLE DAMAGES CAN RECEIVE CAN BE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER -- THIS PRACTICE AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE IF YOU BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT IT RATE RESULTS PERPETUATE SYSTEMIC INEQUITY. A DISPROPORTIONATE AFFECTS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- AND IS BASICALLY IF YOU LOOKED UP THE DEFINITION OF UNFAIR IN THE DICTIONARY YOU WOULD SEE THIS RIGHT THERE. AND SO WITH ME TODAY IS ROBERT JOHNSON A LEADING FORENSIC ECONOMIST WHO HAS BEEN ILL TELL USED VERY IMPRESSIVE STORY SEEN THIS PLAY OUT IN COURT ROOM AFTER COURT ROOM FIRSTHAND. AND DEBBIE CHIANG WITH THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA ALTERED OVER TO MR JOHNSON. THANK YOU FIRST WITH US PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. HI ROBERT W. JOHNSON A THIRTY EIGHT YEAR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WITH AN MBA FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY [inaudible] BY. THANK YOU BY PROFESSION I'M A FORENSIC ECONOMIST. WHO SPECIALIZES IN CALCULATING DAMAGES IN CIVIL LITIGATION? BUY A QUALIFIED NEW TESTIFIED IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALL FOR FEDERAL DISTRICTS. IN CALIFORNIA FORTY STATES IN TWO U. S. TERRITORIES. I AM A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FORENSIC ECONOMISTS FIVE EVALUATED THOUSANDS OF PERSONAL INJURY AND WRONGFUL DEATH CASES. OVER THE PAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS. I AM HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL FORTY ONE BECAUSE IT'S INTENT IS TO STOP THE USE OF RACE GENDER AND ETHNICITY METRICS. THAT REDUCE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF INJURED PEOPLE IN CIVIL LITIGATION. MO OVER SENATE BILL FORTY ONE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS WITH OUT REDUCING THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF ANY OTHER RACIAL GENDER OR ETHNIC GROUP OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. I WAS A FORENSIC ECONOMIST. IN A TRIAL REGARDING THE WRONGFUL DEATH OF AN AFRICAN AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENTS. MY TASK WAS TO CALCULATE. THE LOST FUTURE EARNINGS CAPACITY USING THE U. S. GOVERNMENT EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT TABLES. DURING MY CROSS EXAMINATION THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY ASKS ME DID YOU WOULD JUST WITH THE FACT. THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS BLACK I SAID YES. HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID BUT YOU USE THE EARNINGS OF A WHITE MALE. I SAID I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHOICE.% I EXPLAINED THAT THE US GOVERNMENT EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT TABLES. INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO ARE. SIXTY FIVE BUT IF YOU'RE SIXTY FIVE AT THAT TIME. THAT MEANT YOU STARTED IN THE WORK FORCE IN THE LEAD EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES WHICH IS BEFORE BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION. BEFORE THE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE EQUAL PAY ACT WE YOU FINISH IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY WHERE YOU START. I DON'T KNOW OF A SINGLE ECONOMIST IN MY THIRTY FIVE YEARS WHO'S EVER STATED THAT WOMEN AND MINORITIES WERE NOT SUBJECT TO DISCRIMINATION. IN HIRING PAY AND PROMOTION THE ONLY DATA SAID THAT DID NOT EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD BE MY WHITE MALES A CONDOM IS MUST. USE AND ASSUME THAT FUTURE EMPLOYERS. WILL FOLLOW THE LAW AND NOT DISCRIMINATE WE PAY COURT REPORTERS THE SAME WITH A POSTAL WORKERS THE SAME. BLACK WHITE MALE TO FEMALE I TURNED TO DEFENSE COUNSEL AND SAID. YOU PUT IN THE SAME RIGHT YEAH SURE NOT A PROBLEM. THE WAS NOT AN ISSUE FOR ME THERE WAS NOT AN ISSUE FOR THE JURY. TODAY IN CALIFORNIA WOMEN AND MINORITIES CONSTITUTE OVER 70%. OF THE POPULATION OVER 60% OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE GRADUATES IF THEY GET INJURED THEY YOU WILL BE SHORT CHANGE. THE COURSE THE COURSE THE TO THE CAUSE OF THIS SHORT CHANGE IS THE USE BY 92% OF THE FORENSIC ECONOMIST. IN THE COUNTRY. IN CIVIL LITIGATION THEY USE GENDER RACE AND ETHNICITY BASED EARNINGS TABLES THESE TABLES PRESERVE. AND REINFORCE HISTORIC WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION AND FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE AS A NATION. LET ME JUST TELL YOU A COUPLE OF THE CASES THAT I'VE WORKED ON I DO NEED TO WRAP. I I NEED YOU TO WRAP UP OKAY FINE. MY FINAL ASSESSMENT WOULD BE. IF YOU LOOK AT A CASE INVOLVING AN EIGHT DAY -- AT NOT A CALLS A MEDICAL SCHOOL GRADUATE. OR A J. D. GRADUATE WHICH WE CALL IN THE ECONOMIC FIELD PROFESSIONAL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MALE. AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALE. LIFETIME EARNINGS TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION IF HE IS A WHITE FEMALE IT'S ONLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN DEFICIT. SENATE BILL FORTY ONE WILL ELIMINATE THIS TYPE OF THIS. DEFICIT.

HISTORICAL DATA BASED ON DECADES OF PRESUMPTION THAT WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WOULD NOT ACHIEVE THE SAME EDUCATIONAL LEVELS OF WHITE MALE. A FACT THAT I THINK MISTER JOHNSON NIGHT TODAY HAVE SHOWN AGAINST. THAT THOSE DECADES OF PRESUMPTION HOWEVER IF EITHER MISTER JOHNSON -- I WORE IN A PLAINTIFF TODAY.

GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL ONE EIGHT EIGHT THE CROWN ACT. WHICH STANDS FOR TO CREATE A RESPECTFUL AND OPEN WORKPLACE FOR NATURAL HAIR. EURO CENTRIC STAND IF YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE LONG TO HELP THE UNDERPINNINGS OF AMERICAN CULTURE SINCE THE FOUNDING OF OUR SOCIETY. DETERMINING WHAT WAS ACCEPTABLE AND ATTRACTIVE IN THE MEDIA IN ACADEMIC SETTINGS AND AT WORK. FOR CENTURIES BLACK MEN AND WOMEN DIDN'T OFTEN CHALLENGED OF STANDARDS WE STRAIGHTENED ARE HERE WITH HEATER CHEMICAL RELAX AND A LACK RELAXERS TO MEET THOSE EURO CENTRIC STANDARDS. UNTIL TWENTY SIXTEEN A GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH FOR THE TERM UNPROFESSIONAL HAIRSTYLES YIELDED ONLY PICTURES OF BLACK WOMEN WITH NATURAL HAIR OR WEARING BRAIDS -- TWISTS. ALTHOUGH THIS HARDING THE FACT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY SURPRISING. AND SO MEMBERS THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEASURES TWO FOLD FIRST IT'S CLEAR THAT THE GREAT NEED TO EDUCATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC. ABOUT THE UNIQUE QUALITIES OF BLACK HAIR TEXTURE AND HOW THEY RELATE. TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO WHERE HE NATURAL HAIR STYLES AS WELL AS THE EXPERIENCES OF BLACK PEOPLE. SECONDLY IT'S DUE TIME TO CHALLENGE THE COMMONLY HELD MYTHS AND MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT WHAT DETERMINES PROFESSIONAL HAIR IN THE WORKPLACE IN SCHOOLS. AND EVEN THE MILITARY. FOR YEARS THERE BEEN TOO MANY CASES OF BLACK EMPLOYEES AND APPLICANTS DENIED EMPLOYMENT OR PROMOTION AND EVEN IN EVEN TERMINATED. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY CHOSE TO WEAR THEIR HAIR. STUDENTS SENT HOME FROM SCHOOL BASED ON POLICIES THAT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOUNG BLACK GIRLS AND BOYS WHOSE PARENTS HAVE CHOSEN TO LOCK THEIR HEAR MORE BRAVE THEY'RE HERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GROOMED HAIR STYLES LIKE MY LOCKS WHICH WOULD WITHOUT QUESTION FIT AN IMAGE OF PROFESSIONALISM. IF BIAS OR NEGATIVE STEREO TYPES WERE NOT INVOLVED. SPECIFICALLY SB ONE EIGHTY EIGHT FOR TEXAS RIGHT BY CLEAR FLYING IN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT AND THE EDUCATION QUOTE. THAT THE DEFINITION OF RACE IS INCLUSIVE OF TRAITS HISTORICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH REYES. I EAT HERE TEXTURE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO HAIR TEXTURE AND NATURAL OR PROTECTIVE HAIRSTYLES. THIS BILL DOES NOT SUPERSEDE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE REGULATIONS OR PREVENT EMPLOYERS FROM ENFORCING REASONABLE GROOMING STANDARDS THAT RELATE TO A BONAFIDE JOB QUALIFICATION. THE CROWN ACT HAS ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND HAS RECEIVED NO NO VOTE. WITH ME HERE TODAY I'M PROUD TO HAVE WON THE GREEN WAS A VISITING PROFESSOR AT WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW WHERE SHE SERVES AS THE FRANCIS LEWIS SCHOLAR IN RESIDENCE. MISS GREENE IS THE LEADING EXPERT ON HERE DISCRIMINATION CASES AND WAS QUOTED IN THE EOC VERSUS CMS COURT OPINION. ALSO WITH US HERE TODAY IS A Q. A HATCHET PAUL WHO IS A LICENSED COSMETOLOGIST ANALOG TITIAN'S SHE OWNS A SALON HERE IN SACRAMENTO. CALLED SACRED GROUND SALON THEY WILL BUT MISS HAVE TO FALL WILL SPEAK ON THE INTRICACIES AND PROCESS OF NATURAL HAIR STYLES IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE LOW. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. OKAY GOOD MORNING CHAIR IN MEMBERS MY NAME IS WENDY GREEN AND AS THE SENATOR POINTED OUT I'M A LEADING ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAW PROFESSOR AND ADVOCATE I GRADUATED FROM XAVIER UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA NEW ORLEANS WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH AND A DOUBLE MINOR. IN AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES IN SPANISH I ALSO EARNED BY JURIS DOCTORATE FROM TULANE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW ALSO IN NEW ORLEANS AND A MASTERS OF LIVE FROM THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW. WHERE SPECIALIZED COMPARED OF SLAVERY AND RACE RELATIONS LAW AS WELL AS EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW MY LEGAL PUBLICATIONS HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN CREATING CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AND WORKPLACES PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS? EIGHT IN SCHOOLS INCLUDING THE NEW YORK CITY COMMISSION ONHUMAN RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE WHICH CLARIFIES LIKE THE CROWN ACT NATURAL HERE DISCRIMINATION CONSTITUTES UNLAWFUL RACE DISCRIMINATION. ACCORDINGLY I'VE SPENT MUCH OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER n LEGAL ACADEMIC INCREASING AWARENESS AROUND THE HARMS OF UNCHECKED DISCRIMINATORY GROOMING POLICIES. MAYBE POLICIES THAT DID A GREAT% NATURAL HAIR STYLES AS EXTREME EXCESSIVE DISTRACTING AND KEPT POLICIES THAT REQUIRE AFRICAN SENTENCE TO CUT OFF THEIR HERE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE WAY IT NATURALLY GROWS OUT OF THEIR HEADS. OR IN THE CASE OF AFRICAN DESCENT IT WOMEN AND GIRLS GROOMING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE THAT THEY DON STREET HERE USUALLY ACHIEVE THE TOXIC CHEMICALS EXTREME HEAT STYLING WIGS AND WEAVES. WHICH ARE EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING TO MAINTAIN THE TO OPT TO RESULT IN PAINFUL CHEMICAL BURNS HAIR AND SCALP DAMAGE AS WELL AS HAIR LOSS RESEARCH ALSO INDICATES POTENTIAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN HAIR STRAIGHTENING PRODUCTS THAT BLACK WOMEN FREQUENTLY USE. IN THEIR INCREASE CHANCES OF DEVELOPING UTERINE FIBROIDS FORMER CORPSMAN RELATED INFERTILITY AND MORE AGGRESSIVE FORMS OF BREAST AND UTERINE CANCER. SIMILARLY STUDIES INDICATE A POSSIBLE LINKAGE BETWEEN CHEMICAL RELAX AND AN INCREASED HORMONAL ACTIVITY. ACTIVITY AMONG AFRICAN THE SENATE GIRLS THEREFORE NATURAL HERE BE AND SLEEP AFRICAN DESCENT IT WOMEN AND GIRLS IN A PRECARIOUS CATCH TWENTY TWO EITHER DON YOUR NATURAL HAIR AT THE RISK OF LOSS BELIEVE. BEING DEPRIVED AND EMPLOYMENT IN ORDER EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY OR DON STRAIGHT HAIR AT THE RISK OF AN DURING CONSEQUENTIAL HARMS TO YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL PHYSICAL ANIMAL NO WELL BEING. MY SCHOLARSHIP IN ADVOCACY HAVE CRITIQUE FEDERAL COURT DECISIONS WHICH SANCTION THIS CATCH TWENTY TWO BY FAILING TO TREAT NATURAL HERE BE AS AS RACE DISCRIMINATION. THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IS LARGELY DUE TO AN OUTDATED TRADITIONALLY CREATE ROLE KNOWN AS THEY MUTABILITY DOCTRINE WHICH I CAN DISCUSS IN Q. AND A IF NEEDED. BUT MOST NOTABLY FEDERAL COURTS STRICT APPLICATION OF THE MUTABILITY DOCTRINE HAS PRODUCED HAIR SPLITTING DISTINCTIONS IF FOR EXAMPLE AN EMPLOYER DENIES AN AFRICAN THE SENATE A JOB BECAUSE SHE TO ADORN THE AFRO. THE EMPLOYER ENGAGES AN UNLAWFUL RACE DISCRIMINATION HOWEVER THE MOMENT SHE TWIST LOCKS OR BRAIDS THAT AFRO HER HAIR. IT SEVERS ADVERSE TREATMENT ON GROUNDS ON THESE GROUNDS THE EMPLOYERS DISCRIMINATION IS DEEMED LAWFUL. THE CROWN ACT FEELS THIS A JUSTIFIABLE GAP IN STATUTORY PROTECTION FOR WORKERS AND STUDENTS WHO SUFFER NATURAL HAIR DISCRIMINATION ASSISTED MAKE FORM OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION THAT HARKENS BACK TO AREAS OF RACIAL SLAVERY. AND RACIAL APARTHEID IN THIS COUNTRY BASED UPON CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE ROLE AS A NATIONAL LEADER IN ADVANCING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL THERE TRULY IS NO BETTER STATE TO NOT ONLY HAVE THIS TIMELY DIALOGUE ON NATURAL HERE DISCRIMINATION AND WORKPLACES AND SCHOOLS. BUT ALSO TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION TOWARD CORRECTING THIS INEQUALITY UNDER THE LAW THANK YOU [inaudible] SPLITTING DECISIONS. I GOT THE THAT'S GOOD USE THAT. AND YOU DON'T EVEN CRAPPIE DID THAT SMOOTHLY. I ONLY BRING THE BEST BEFORE YOU'RE. ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY GET IF IF IF YOU COULD ONLY BRING SOME EXAMPLES OF ON PROFESSIONAL HAIR STYLING SO THAT WE COULD SEE COULD YOU BRING SOME EXAMPLES OF UNPROFESSIONAL I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S NOT MY JOB TO DO I WOULD ONLY BE BEFORE YOU PROFESSIONAL EXAMPLE. OKAY SO I NOTICE [inaudible] PLEASE. I GOOD MORNING TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS A KILLER WE MONNA HATCHET FALL AND I AM. A COSMETOLOGIST AND ALSO A PERSON IS DONE NATURAL HAIR FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS. I ALSO HAVE A BACKGROUND IN PAN AFRICAN STUDIES AND I'VE SERVE A COMMUNITY AND OUR COMMUNITY AS A BECAUSE AS A COMMUNITY ACTIVIST ALSO. AND HAVE OVER -- THREE HUNDRED CLIENTS SO. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO ADD -- TO IS ALSO THAT. FROM THE BEGINNING BEFORE COLONIZATION BEFORE WE EVEN CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AFRICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS HAD. THEIR HAIR AS A CROWN OF GLORY AS AS A A POINT OF OF JUST KNOWING WHO THEY ARE -- IT IS NOT JUST EVER BEEN A HAIRSTYLE FOR US IT'S ALWAYS THE NOTED THINGS LIKE OUR TRIBE OR CLAN IS DENOTED OUR MARITAL STATUS ARE ECONOMIC STATUS. IT DENOTES EVERYTHING FOR US IT TRULY IS OF THE FIRST THING THAT YOU LOOK AT YOU CAN TELL WHAT A POOR PERSON IS THAT WHEN THEY LOOK AT THEIR HAIR. SO TO HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE ANDBE MARGINALIZED TO EURO CENTRIC WHITES OF FROM THE STANDARDS OF BEAUTY IS NOT ONLY IT LIKE -- LIKE -- SISTER. WENDY SAID -- IS NOT JUST A HARMFUL TO A PSYCHOLOGICALLY PHYSICALLY MENTALLY -- BUT IT OF THE ALSO IS JUST A DAMPENING OF YOUR SPIRIT TO NOT BE ABLE TO PUT 1100% FOR THE WHO YOU ARE. AS A PERSON -- AND ALWAYS HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHO YOU ARE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO BE SUBJECTED TO ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS.

AND WE ARE PROUD SUPPORTERS OF SB THIRTY WHICH REFLECTS CALIFORNIA'S RESPECT FOR THE VALUES AND LONG TERM PLANS OF ITS DIVERSE POPULATION. AND PROVIDES GREATER FREEDOM FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. EQUALITY CALIFORNIA LED THE WAY IN OUR STATE'S QUEST TO ACHIEVE MARRIAGE EQUALITY FOR SAME SEX COUPLES. AND AS PART OF THAT WORK THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. HELD THAT STATE LAWS SHOULDN'T TREAT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THEREFORE CALIFORNIA'S DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP REGISTRY IS OUTDATED AND SHOULD NO LONGER BE ONLY AVAILABLE. TO SAME SEX COUPLES OR OPPOSITE SEX COUPLES OVER AGE SIXTY TWO IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL COUPLES NOT EVERYONE WISHES TO ENTER INTO MARRIAGE BUT ALL COUPLES SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS AND FAMILIES RECOGNIZED AND PROTECTED.

MISTER CHAMBERS MATTHEW CYBERLINK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS ELECTION OFFICIALS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIVER BIRMINGHAM ON BEHALF OF THE LONG BEACH BAR ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. RIGHT THE NONE OF BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WITH GALLAGHER. SOME SENATOR I'M GONNA BE SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY -- BUT IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION -- DO WE NEED TO MASTER PARTNERSHIPS ANYMORE IN CALIFORNIA I MEAN. THE CIVIL CONCEPT LEGAL CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE THAT. THEY WERE ALL CONCERNED WITH ENCOMPASSES A LOT OF DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT. IT IN INCLUDES YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HAVE COVETED COMMITTED. RELATIONSHIPS AND ALSO PEOPLE WHO HAVE. YOU KNOW MAYBE A MORE ABOUT AN ARRANGEMENT OF CONVENIENCE TYPE OF OF MERIT RIGHT IT IT. INCLUDES PEOPLE THAT. HAVE A RELIGIOUS VIEW OF THEIR MARRIAGE AND NON RELIGIOUS VIEW OF THEIR MARRIAGE WE STILL VIEW THAT AS MARRIAGE LEGALLY -- IT INCLUDES EVEN PEOPLE WHO -- NO LONGER LIVE TOGETHER LIVE COMPLETELY SEPARATE LIVES MAY WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT ARE STILL LEGALLY MARRIED. FOR THE PURPOSES OF LAW AND SO FOR ALL OF OUR TAX PURPOSES AND OTHER PURPOSES ARE STILL. THE UDA'S MERIT SO I MEAN THE COMTE THE LEGAL CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE INCLUDES A LOT OF DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS AS I THINK IS THE MOTIVATION BEHIND. YOUR BILL -- SO WHY NOT JUST HAVE PEOPLE. IS IT JUST THE WORD MARRIAGE OR IS IT WHY HAVE THIS KIND OF TWO DIFFERENT CLASSES. AND TO BEG THE QUESTION ALSO HAS THAT IS IT SORT OF A SEPARATE BUT EQUAL. DISTINCTION IF WE CONTINUE TO KEEP. DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS AND MARRIAGES AS IF THEY'RE KIND OF TWO DIFFERENT THINGS LEGALLY. WELL I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND I THAT THE BALLOT TOPIC OF DISCUSSION IT'S ONLY SEPARATE BUT EQUAL IF PEOPLE ARE FORCED INTO ONE OR THE OTHER BUT THIS IS ABOUT TOWARDS. ON THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS THAT SHE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF OUTLINING THE VARIOUS. REASONS EITHER FINANCIAL OR PHILOSOPHICAL THAT PEOPLE MIGHT CHOOSE TO BE THE MASTER PARTNERS INSTEAD OF MARRIAGE -- THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO THEY JUST DON'T BELIEVE IN THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE BUT THEY DO WANT TO HAVE BASIC PROTECTIONS -- IN CALIFORNIA FOR THEIR FAMILY AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN -- AND FOR IN HEARD AND SO ALL OF THOSE. NEEDS -- THERE ALSO -- POTENTIAL -- TAX IMPLICATIONS OF GETTING MARRIED AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME PEOPLE WHO BECAUSE OF COURSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T RECOGNIZE DOMESTIC PARTNERS AND VIEWS -- AS STILL BEING SINGLE AND THERE MIGHT BE COUPLES OUT BECAUSE OF A FEDERAL TAX ISSUES MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO BE MARRIED -- IN ADDITION -- FOR SENIORS THERE ARE IMPLICATIONS OF BEING MARRIED OR NOT MARRIED IN TERMS OF SOCIAL SECURITY WHICH IS WHY -- WE'VE ALWAYS ALLOWED ANYONE SIXTY TWO AND OLDER -- TO ENTER INTO THE DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS BECAUSE OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ISSUES SO THERE ARE STILL REASONS ABOUT AGAIN BOTHPHILOSOPHICAL OR FINANCIAL WHY PEOPLE MIGHT CHOOSE TO DO THIS -- AND SO -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THE DEBATE -- BUT FOR NOW WE WHEN I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT DISCRIMINATING.

ALL RIGHT SEE NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS GALLAGHER SO -- JUST CURIOUS AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE -- WHAT WHY WHY NOT OBTAIN YOUR CITIZENSHIP I MEAN -- HAVE YOU TRIED TO OR IS WHAT'S. WHAT'S KIND OF THE IMPEDIMENT -- BARRIER THERE. THROUGH THE CHAIR SIR. SO I THINK IT IS -- IMMIGRATION VERY COMPLICATED IS VERY CASE BY CASE -- UNFORTUNATELY -- IT YET THERE'S A LOT OF BARRIERS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY TYPE OF REFORM SINCE EIGHTY SIX SO A LOT OF FOLKS EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BE PRESENT HERE AND THEY HAVE A WERE THE STORY. UNFORTUNATELY THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS AND CASE LAW DOESN'T ALLOW FOR THEM TO ADJUST THEIR STATUS AT ANY POINT IN TIME -- AND AND CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUT EVEN THEN -- I THINK A LOT OF THE FOLKS OVER REPRESENT -- HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL RESOURCES TO TRY TO ADJUST THEIR STATUS BUT UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE OF A BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. BOB UNFORTUNATELY NOTHING AS A OF TO THEM. RIGHT. THE MAGIC DO NOT WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT'S OKAY IT'S NOT YEAH. FROM YOU GUYS BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BY LAW. YEAH OKAY GO AHEAD -- SO I'LL TRY TO MAKE A REALLY LONG STORY MEDIUM [inaudible] I TRY. IS IT IT'S BEEN ATTORNEY I MOVED HERE WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN I MOVED TO MINNESOTA AS AN EXCHANGE STUDENT. I LIVED WITH -- A LUTHERAN FAMILY I CAME FROM. BEING AN ONLY CHILD MY MY DAD PASSED AWAY WHEN I WAS. FIFTEEN AND AT THE SAME TIME I WAS SUED BY HIS GIRLFRIEND'S FOR HALF OF MY INHERITANCE. SHE WAS THREATENING BOB AND SO MY MOM. DECIDED TO SEND ME. TO THE UNITED STATES SO I COULD GET  DIFFERENT APPLAUSE MORE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE OF FROM WHAT I WAS HAVING -- I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL IN MINNESOTA WHERE A LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE IS THAT THE CITY OF NEW ON A ON TOP I LATER WENT TO COLLEGE AND I MATT MY EX HUSBAND. WE WERE MATT WAS SO. UP UNTIL I MET HIM I WAS LEGAL. AND I HAD TO TRANSFER MY STATUS TO BE SPONSORED UNDER HIM. AND WE WERE TOGETHER FOR FIVE YEARS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE TOO YOUNG AND WAS MEANT TO BE AND I NEVER I'VE NEVER GOT AN INTERVIEW. SO TECHNICALLY MY CASE STILL OPEN. ANY JUST FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS. AND IT'S JUST AN IMMIGRATION FLAW PROBABLY A CLIP CLERICAL ERROR. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO I DON'T QUALIFY FOR EINSTEIN VISA. UNFORTUNATELY. AND YOU HAVE TO IT IT'S A VERY TOUGH THERE'S NO EASY. WAY FOR UP A PERSON. WHO IS STOP? TAKING UNDER SOMEONE'S UMBRELLA. TO HAVE TO FIX IT SO MY ONLY IN. MY ONLY SOLUTION FROM THIS POINT FORWARD IS TO GET REMARRIED. BOB AND I I REFUSED TO DO IT. IN THE ILLEGAL WAY SO IT IS. UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT WOULD CHANGE. TO FACILITATE IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF REFORM IN ORDER. TO I HAVE A FAIR. NONE. NONE SOCIAL ECONOMICAL. BASED SO THAT THAT EMBRACES EVERYBODY'S SO ANYBODY COULD HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE PROPER STEPS TO GET THERE. RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT A A PATHWAY. I JUST WANNA ADD ONE QUICK THING ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS HAVE AN AVERAGE OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA FOR TEN YEARS. SO THEY'RE VERY WELL ESTABLISHED THERE ALSO -- A MIX THAT IS FAMILIES ABOUT 70% OF A MORE AND MAKE STATUS FAMILY SO YOU HAVE A PARENT. OF WHOSE UNDOCUMENTED CITIZEN. OF SPOUSE I MEAN YOU KNOW LEGAL RESIDENT KIT I MEAN IT'S IT'S EVERYTHING MIXED UP IN THERE SO THIS IS A VERY INTEGRATED PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU CANNOT TELL ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WE LIVE TOGETHER WE WORK TOGETHER WE GO TO CHURCH TOGETHER IT'S A VERY VERY MIXED -- A YOU KNOW A PART OF OUR COMMUNITY SO AS LONG AS THEY'RE A MIX PART OF OUR COMMUNITY WE FEEL LIKE. THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY IN POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT YOU KNOW ELECTED -- THEY'RE NOT PAID BUT THEY REALLY WANT TO GIVE TO OUR COMMUNITY WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE SO. THANK YOU FOR THOSE ANSWERS AND AND ME I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HEAR THE HUMAN SIDE. OF THE STORY HERE AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHY I WAS. NOT ASKING THAT AND I AND LET ME JUST SAY I I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE -- THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS BILL AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. TO THE PEOPLE WHO TESTIFY HERE'S FOR YOUR SERVICE TO YOUR COMMUNITY IS VERY COMMENDABLE IS LAUDABLE -- OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE DOING. GREAT THINGS ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITIES AND CERTAINLY. THAT DOESN'T YOU KNOW -- WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN DO THAT AND IT WITH AN OFFICIAL TITLE OR NOT. ACTUALLY I WOULD ARGUE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE MOST WORKING PEOPLE WITHOUT A TITLE YOU KNOW THAT DON'T HAVE. A POSITION -- THEY JUST GO OUT THERE AND DO GREAT THINGS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I AND I SEE HIM EVERY DAY -- SO I'M I'M TRULY THANKFUL FOR THAT. I THINK WHERE IT COMES TO FOR ME ON THIS ISSUE THOUGH IS IT CITIZENSHIP DOES HAVE TO MEAN SOMETHING OR OR DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING AT ALL RIGHT AND IN OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS SET UP THAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO BECOME CITIZENS. AND THE BENEFIT THAT COMES FROM BEING A CITIZEN IS. IS THE FULL PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNMENT IS THE ABILITY TO VOTE IS THE ABILITY TO RUN FOR ELECTED OUT TO HOLD OFFICE. THE WHOLE GOVERNMENTAL OFFICE. AND AND YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TO MANY OF THESE CEREMONIES WHERE PEOPLE BECOME. NEW CITIZENS AND IT'S AN AMAZING THING AND IT'S A AND AND THESE PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF NATURALIZATION. AND I AM THE FIRST TO AGREE TO HAVE A BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WE DO AND AND AND M. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO MAKE THIS. A SIMPLER PROCESS BUT MULTI MILLION WANT PEOPLE. TO COME IN TO CITIZENSHIP LEARN ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT. AN EX AND AND AT THE END THAT THAT. THAT PLEDGE THAT HEY I'M RENOWNED SCENE MY ALLEGIANCE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND NOW I'M I'M. A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA RIGHT IN [inaudible] SO. I THINK THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE HERE IS NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO SERVE NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT YOU SERVING YOUR COMMUNITY -- BUT THAT WE DO HAVE TO RESPECT THE PROCESS OF CITIZENSHIP -- AND THAT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING THAT THAT'S WHAT GOVERNOR BROWN SAID LAST YEAR WHEN HE VETOED I THINK YOU CAN HAVE BOTH OF THOSE POSITIONS AND STILL VALUE THE SERVICE RIGHT -- AND SAY HEY HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT -- YO. AND HAVE RESPECT FOR THE PROCESS OF CITIZENSHIP -- AND I AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE I'M AT ON THIS LEGISLATION [inaudible] THE STRESS. I THINK THE QUESTION FROM MY COLLEAGUE [inaudible] EMPHASIZES THE THE LACK OF TRUE UNDERSTANDING THE LACK OF TRUE KNOWLEDGE. OF HOW BROKEN. OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS -- WOULD LOVE EVERYBODY TO FOLLOW EVERY RULE. BUT IF THERE ARE NO RULES. AND IF PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO DO TO PARTICIPATE IN A GOVERNMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN VOLUNTEERING TO PARTICIPATE. ARE THERE STILL SEEN AS SECOND CLASS IS STILL SEEN AS FORCED TO SIT. TO TO HIDE IN THE SHADOWS WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM. AND BUT IT BUT THE QUESTION IT WAS IT WAS A A A WELL MEANT QUESTION I AM CERTAIN. BUT IT ABSOLUTELY SHOWS THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. OF MOST PEOPLE OF HOPE BROKEN HOPE BROKEN OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS AND UNTIL WE REALLY FIND A WAY TO FIX THIS SYSTEM -- WE ARE FORCING PEOPLE INTO THE SHADOWS WE ARE FORCING PEOPLE TO TO BE LESS THAN WHO WHO THEY ARE -- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT [inaudible] MR. TO I WAS GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM BUT I WANTED TO RESPOND TO THE SUGGESTION ACROSS THE AISLE AND THE QUESTION OF WHY NOT OBTAIN CITIZENSHIP AND SAY. I'M NOT CONTRIBUTE THIS TO TO TO OUR COLLEAGUE BUT I THINK THERE ARE MANY. WHO ARE ACROSS THE AISLE WHO ASKED THE QUESTION ONE IT YOU BECOME A CITIZEN? AND IT REALLY IS A PRETEXT TO SAY -- THE SUGGESTION THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BECOME A CITIZEN OR YOU -- DON'T HAVE THE QUALITIES TO BECOME A CITIZEN NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT THAT IS OFTEN HOW THIS QUESTION. IS ASKED AND CURRENT POLITICAL DISCOURSE AND I WOULD SUGGEST I THINK IT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY OUR POLITICAL OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS IS BROKEN. IT IS BROKEN. BUT OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS ALSO A POLITICAL CONSTRUCT IT IS. IT IS A SET OF POLICIES AND LAWS THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE WITH THOSE WHO CAN CONTROL POLICY. AND IT HAS BEEN SET UP IN THE LAST COUPLE DECADES IN A WAY TO NOT ALLOW. IMMIGRANTS TO HAVE A REAL PATH TO CITIZENSHIP EVEN. FOR MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS OF HUMAN BEINGS. WHO WANT TO BECOME CITIZENS AS A FORMER IMMIGRANT RIGHTS ATTORNEY IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES I CAN TELL YOU IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN? IN THE LAST DECADE THE SYSTEM WAS BROKEN IN THIS DECADE THE SYSTEM IS IS BROKEN. AND AT THIS MOMENT WITH A PRESIDENT WHO WAS DECLARED WAR ON OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHO IS DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN THROUGH HIS ADMINISTRATION. TO KEEP INDIVIDUALS FROM BECOMING CITIZENS -- THAT IS WHY. INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT. OBTAINING CITIZENSHIP AND I JUST WANNA SAY WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I FIND IT VERY IRONIC WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE MANY OF THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTS THAT ARE CITED IN THIS COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. BY THE SAME SUPREME COURT ANALYSES CASES THAT THIS PRESIDENT. IS TRYING TO OVERTURN. ONE TO MARK. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SUGGESTED THAT BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD QUESTION. PLYLER VERSUS DEL ANOTHER UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT ANOTHER CASE THAT THIS PRESIDENT. WOULD LIKE TO OVERTURN SO -- THIS BILL THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING I THINK IS -- IS IS A GREAT BILL SOMETHING WE SHOULD SUPPORT AND IF THE SENATOR WOULD LIKE I WOULD BE HAPPY BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR -- WE HAVE TO DO THESE THINGS AT THIS TIME WHEN OUR SIT ARE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ARE UNDER ASSAULT. TO TO SAY THAT EVEN DURING THIS DARK TIME OF HISTORY. WHEN OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OUR WORK FORCE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE UNDER ASSAULT? THERE ARE SOME OF US WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY WITH THAT COLLECT TO MAKE THE MOTION OF THE SPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE WE DO ALREADY HAVE A MOTION A SECOND BUT THANK YOU -- MR HOLDEN. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND I WON'T REPEAT. THEIR ELOQUENCE IN TERMS OF LINING AND DEFINING THE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ALL FACE WITH A BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND SO WE'VE BEEN HEARING THIS OF FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME BUT NOTHING SEEMS TO BE DONE. HOW TO ADVANCE THE THE BALL -- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT TO THE WITNESSES YOUR BEING HERE THERE'S A DEFINITION OF CITIZENSHIP YOUR PARTICIPATED IN THE PROCESS TO BE IN YOUR COMMUNITY TO GET EDUCATED. TO GIVE BACK TO US SUPPORT YOUR CHURCHES IN YOUR COMMUNITY TO EMPOWER THEM -- TO BE UP LIFTING AND BE INSPIRATIONAL -- IS ALSO THE DEFINITION OF CITIZENSHIP AND I THINK THAT -- YOU'RE TO BE COMMENDED -- AGAINST A LOT OF ODDS -- BUT YOU ARE -- ALSO HERE ILLUMINATING -- THE DARK PLACES OF WHERE WE HAVE TO SEE THE LIGHTS START TO SHINE BECAUSE IF IT DOES NOT. THEN IT CONTINUES TO BE DIFFICULT AND I WANT. TO THANK THE AUTHOR. OF FOR HER CONTINUED LEADERSHIP EVEN BEFORE SHE GOT HERE AS A SENATOR OF THE KIND OF COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY AND EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS IN THE STAND UP AND THAT'S WHAT I SEE THIS BILL REPRESENTING AND YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT [inaudible] SCOUTER. JUST VERY BRIEFLY LIKE AGAIN NOBODY IS UNDERMINING THE SERVICES THESE PEOPLE -- THESE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE TESTIFIED HERE DID THIS MORNING -- ARE DOING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. BUT WE DO HAVE TO SAY THERE IS A BODY OF LAW ABOUT CITIZENSHIP AND THAT AND THAT DIESEL OFFICES BOTH ELECTED AND APPOINTED. ARE TO BE FILLED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE CITIZENS AND EVERYBODY OF LAW IS POLITICAL AS A POLITICAL CONSTRUCT. AT THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THOSE ARGUMENTS THIS MORNING I DOUBT THAT THEY WOULD SAY WE DON'T HAVE TO FILE THE FILE FALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED IN THE STATE WHICH ARE POLITICAL CONSTRUCT AND THE PEOPLE JUST IGNORED THEM THAT WOULD BE OKAY -- YOU KNOW EVERYBODY OF LAW IS A POLITICAL CONSTRUCT THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND I WOULD ALSO SAY TO THOSE. CITIZENS WHO HAVE SWORN IN WHO LIVE SPOKE AT THE CITIZENS WERE IN CEREMONIES. THEY WENT THROUGH THAT ARDUOUS PROCESS THAT THAT TOUGH PROCESS THAT IS. I THINK A LOT OF US AGREE NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE. BUT THEY WENT THROUGH IT AND THEY YOU KNOW BECAME CITIZENS. AND I THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THEM TO SAY WELL YOU WANT TO THAT PROCESS IN. THE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS IT'S UNFAIR IT WOULD BE UNFAIR PROCESS TO DO THAT -- DOESN'T TAKE AWAY AGAIN. FROM THE GREAT SERVICE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CITIZENS CAN STILL PROVIDE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND DO COULD PROVIDE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES -- AND I THINK AGAIN YOU CAN LIVE IN BOTH OF THOSE WORLDS. AND SAY LOOK THIS THIS IS THE LAW AND WE DO HAVE TO FOLLOW THE LAW WHETHER WE I'M SURE ALL OF US TO GO AROUND AND AND POINT OUT LAWS THAT WE DON'T LIKE. THAT WE DON'T DO WE DON'T THINK SHOULD BE THE CASE BUT THERE LAW. NONE THE LESS [inaudible] A STRESS. THERE IS NO PROCESS. THE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THERE IS NO PROCESS WE HAVE DHAKA STUDENTS. WHO HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THE THE THE VALUE THAT THEY ARE TO ALL OF US? HAVE BEEN GIVEN TEMPORARY STATUS THERE IS NO PROCESS ZERO PROCESS IF THERE WERE I GUARANTEE YOU I GUARANTEE YOU THE MAJORITY THEM WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN CITIZENS. THERE IS NO PROCESS ANOTHER. ANOTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION ALSO IS THAT. THERE IS SUCH A THING AS DUAL CITIZENSHIP WITH MANY PEOPLE. WHO HAVE DUAL CITIZENSHIP IT ISN'T JUST ONE CITIZENSHIP AND NOT JUST FOR MEXICO BUT FOR MANY OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY RETAIN THEIR CITIZENSHIP? FROM THERE THERE. THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OR THEIR PARENTS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. AND THE U. S.. BUT AS OF NOW THERE IS NO PROCESS FOR MANY OF THESE WHO WOULD LOVE TO BECOME US CITIZENS ALL RIGHT. BECAUSE OF I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU -- I THINK I'M A CO AUTHOR IF NOT I'D LIKE TO BE NOW. AT FOUR THIS BILL IT IT'S AN IMPORTANT BILL -- AND I'D I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT WE CAN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO PROCESS AND AND I THINK THOSE OF US WHO WHO LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND FACES EVERY DAY. WITH OUR STAFF WITH OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WITH OUR NEIGHBORS UNDERSTAND -- IT IN LARGELY WITH FOLKS WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE IMMIGRATION PROCESS -- THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THERE THERE'S THERE'S NO LINE TO GET INTO -- THERE I I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT COMES FROM BUT WE WE WE ARE FRUSTRATED BY IT BUT AS FAR AS ABIDING BY THE LAWS ARE THERE TO ABIDE BY IT I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR CHANGE. SEEKING TO CHANGE THE LAW THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT WHY WE CREATE LOSSES YES THAT'S THE LOT TODAY. AND WE WANT TO CHANGE THE LAW WITHIN OUR POWER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE AND ARE CONTRIBUTING CAN CONTRIBUTE MORE SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU CENTER I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND EIGHT I THINK WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT PREVIOUS GOVERNOR HAD VETOED IT WITH THE REALLY THE MISAPPLICATION. OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CITIZENSHIP ULTIMATELY MEANS AND THERE THERE IS TRUE VALUE TO BEING A UNITED STATES CITIZEN BUT CITIZENSHIP AS WE LEARN. THROUGH ALL OF OUR EDUCATION MEANS MORE THAN JUST WHETHER YOUR TECHNICALLY A CITIZEN UNDER FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW IT'S WHAT YOU DO. FOR YOUR COMMUNITY WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITY AND AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAS WORKED AND A LOT OF WAYS BY PART IN A BIPARTISAN WAY TO RECOGNIZE. THAT WHAT CALVET THE STANDARD CALIFORNIA WANTS TO SET FOR WHO'S ABLE TO WORK WITH THAT ARE COMMUNITIES. IS DIFFERENT THAN THE VISION CURRENTLY BEING ESPOUSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND EVEN POTENTIALLY OTHER STATES AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION HERE. SO TO BE A UNITED STATES CITIZEN AND HAVE VOTING RIGHTS TO BE ABLE TO STAND FOR ELECTIVE OFFICE AND ALL IS NOT WHAT'S BEEN QUESTION HERE. BUT TO BE ABLE TO FILL THE MYRIAD OF POSITIONS. AND GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY IN WAYS THAT MEETS OUR STANDARDS. OUR LAWS THAT WE ARE ALLOWED TO DO EVEN GIVEN THE FEDERAL LAWS. IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY WORTHWHILE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO AND EMBRACE EVERYONE IS HERE WHO TO BE ABLE TO WORK TO THEIR HIGHEST AND BEST. OPPORTUNITIES THAT'S WHICH YOU'VE BROUGHT FORWARD HOPING WITH THIS GOVERNOR WE WE CAN GET THIS THROUGH AND WITH THIS GOVERNOR. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET THIS SIDE THAT WE CAN WELCOME. THESE GREAT FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO DO. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES OUR COMMUNITIES WHAT THEY ARE EQUIPPED TO DO WILLING TO DO NOT EVERYBODY'S WILLING TO DO THIS. I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THINKING AND WITH THAT CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE. YOU'VE ALL BEEN SO ELOQUENCE AND THERE'S NO NEED FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING MORE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

THE SEX GENDER IDENTITY GENDER EXPRESSION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF A PARENT LEGAL GUARDIAN. OR RELATIVE IN DETERMINING THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD FOR THE PURPOSE OF GRANTING CUSTODY AGAIN. THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD IS WHAT IS -- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE? UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW CHILD CUSTODY DETERMINATION ARE GOVERNED BY THE BEST INTEREST STANDARD. A BEST INTEREST DETERMINATION IS A VERY HOLISTIC ANALYSIS IT REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HEALTH AND THE SAFETY AND THE WELFARE OF THE CHILD. THE NATURE IN THE MOUNT OF CONTACT WITH EACH PARENT AND OTHER. OF LIKE RELEVANT FACTORS THE SEX GENDER EXPRESSION GENDER IDENTITY OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF A PARENT. LEGAL GUARDIAN OR RELATIVE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO LOVE AND CARE FOR THEIR CHILD. AND THEREFORE WE BELIEVE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING CUSTODY. OF I HAVE WITH US TODAY WITNESSES REBEKAH BIRMINGHAM OF LOG LONG BEACH BAR ASSOCIATION MANDY TAYLOR OF THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE. AND JENNIFER RICHARD MY CHIEF OF STAFF. THE BILL THANK YOU BUT WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. AND A SECOND FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. HELLO MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MANDY TAYLOR AND I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON AS BEFORE NINETY FIVE BIAS FREE CHILD CUSTODY. I'M A PART OF THE WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE LGBT Q. I A JUSTICE TEAM ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE SPELL COULD YOU BE MORE CLOSELY IN LIKE BUDGET MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING. OR DID. BETTER I THINK SO THANK YOU. I AM A SOCIAL WORKER AND ADVOCATE A MEMBER OF THE QUEER AND TRANS COMMUNITY AND THE PARENT OF AN AMAZING KID. WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS AN INFANT I LEFT MY ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND AND FILED FOR FULL CUSTODY TO ENSURE HER SAFETY? FOR THE LAST THIRTEEN YEARS I HAVE HAD FULL PHYSICAL CUSTODY AND THE FAMILY COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY ENFORCED SUPERVISED PARENTING TIME FOR MY CO PARENT. OUR CHILD SAFETY AND WELL BEING WAS PARAMOUNT TO ME. BECAUSE OF THAT FOR YEARS DURING THE LENGTHY CUSTODY PROCESS I DID NOT FEEL SAFE COMING OUT ABOUT MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION. MY EX HAD MADE HIS BELIEFS ABOUT THE LGBTQ. COMMUNITY VERY CLEAR AND I KNEW THAT I CAN EXPECT RETALIATION IF YOU KNEW MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION. I WAS A SINGLE PARENT WITH AN INFANT AT NO COLLEGE DEGREE I WAS IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAM TRYING TO HEAL AND DEAL WITH MY TRAUMA. I WAS ON WELFARE AND ATTENDING SCHOOL FULL TIME I DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY OR THE TIME AND KNOWLEDGE TO RESEARCH CASE LAW. IF I COULDN'T GUARANTEE AN UNBIASED JUDGE MEDIATOR OR OPPOSING COUNSEL BEING OUT WITH TOO MUCH OF A RISK TO MY DAUGHTER'S SAFETY. I WAITED THREE YEARS TO BE PUBLICLY OUT. I WAITED UNTIL I FINISHED SCHOOL I WAITED UNTIL I WAS SOLIDLY MIDDLE CLASS. I WAITED UNTIL I CAN AFFORD AN ATTORNEY I WAITED UNTIL I HAD A COMMUNITY THAT HELPED ME FEEL SAFE. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT LIKE I DID. BY CODIFYING AND CLARIFYING CASE LAW INTO STATUTE YOU HELP PROTECT CHILDREN BY ENSURING THAT BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION I HAVE NO PLACE WHEN DETERMINING THE BEST INTERESTS OF A CHILD. BY PUTTING THESE PROTECTIONS INTO THE FAMILY COAT YOU REDUCE BARRIERS FOR LOW INCOME PARENTS WHO ARE ON REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL. AND SUPPORT COMMUNITY NETWORKS BY PROVIDING CLEARLY ARTICULATED AND ACCESSIBLE PROTECTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION TO ENSURE BIAS FREE TRIAL CUSTODY ALL CHILDREN DESERVE TO BE SAFE CARED FOR AND LOVED IN THEIR OWN HOME. THERE'S NO ROOM FOR BIAS OR DISCRIMINATION. THANK YOU X. WITH US PLEASE. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SENATOR DORADO MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS RITA BIRMINGHAM I'M PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE LONG BEACH BAR ASSOCIATION. WE ARE A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. WE REPRESENT MANY FAMILIES IN LAW UP ABOUT CUSTODY GUARDIANSHIP ADOPTION PROCEEDINGS. AS SENATOR DORADO SAID THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD IS THE LEGAL STANDARD IN MAKING THESE BECAUSE TONY OLD DETERMINATIONS. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO AMEND FAMILY CODE SECTION THIRTY ELEVEN THIRTY TWENTY AND THIRTY FORTY TO MAKE CLEAR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD FACTORS REMADE WELL BECOME BIAS FREE. A BEST INTEREST ANALYSIS COVERS MANY FACTORS THEY INCLUDE THE MOST IMPORTANT. WHICH ARE THE HEALTH THE SAFETY AND THE WELFARE OF THE CHILD. THE EMOTIONAL TIES BETWEEN A PARENT AND A CHILD. APPEARANCE ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILD EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY. THE CHILD'S TIES TO THEIR HOME AND THEIR COMMUNITY. THERE OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS UNDER SP FOUR NINETY FIVE NONE OF THESE WILL CHANGE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE OLD CONTROLLING CASES OUT THERE. WHICH ALSO PERMIT THE COURT TO CONSIDER A RELEVANT FACTORS SUCH AS THE LGBT Q. STATUS OF A PARENT. THE LEAD CASE REGARDING NON HETEROSEXUAL PARENTS FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT IS MARRIAGE A BIRD SAUL WHICH ALLOWS THE COURT EVEN TODAY. TO CONSIDER THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF A PARENT AND REALLY WHETHER IT HARMS THE CHILD. A PARENT SEX OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS IRRELEVANT TO THE BEST INTEREST ANALYSIS. STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWS THIS IT'S TIME TO CLARIFY THE CASE LAW AND BRING THE LAWN TO CONFORMITY WITH THE SCIENCE WHICH OVERWHELMINGLY SHOWS HAVING IT LGBT Q. PARENT DOES NOT HARM A CHILD. THIS FACTOR SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM CUSTODY DETERMINATION SO THAT EVERY PARENT IS VIEWED EQUALLY. I ALSO KNOW THAT AS DRAFTED THIS LEGISLATION WILL MAKE THE LAW BIAS FREE WITH RESPECT TO EVERY PARENT. NOT JUST LGBT Q. PARENTS THE FOCUS WILL REMAIN ON THE CHILD. ELIMINATING THIS A RELEVANT FACTOR THESE RELEVANT FACTORS FROM A BEST INTEREST ANALYSIS WILL BENEFIT LITIGANTS MANY OF WHOM ARE PROBE HER. WITH CLEAR IN PLAIN LANGUAGE ON THE FACE OF THE STATUTE IT WILL MOSTLY BENEFIT CHILDREN BY REDUCING THE ACRIMONY IN CHILD CUSTODY DETERMINATIONS. WE ASKED TODAY FOR YOUR VOTE TO MOVE SB. FOUR NINETY FIVE THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE. AND UP OKAY BUT IN WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COULD GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE.

I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I AND I THINK I KNOW I HAVE TALKED TO THE AUTHOR AND I THINK I UNDERSTAND -- THE I THIS SHOULD BE THE ANSWER THE QUESTION BY ONE MAKE SURE. WE ARE ONLY TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL ORIENTATION EIGHT JUDGE COULD STILL PREFER OR DECIDE THAT A A TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD IS PREFERABLE OVER ONE PARENT HOUSEHOLD. THAT DOESN'T GO TO GENDER. OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. CRACKED ME THERE'S AN EVEN IF THAT HAPPENS. TO TO ALIGN WITH SEXUAL ORIENTATION [inaudible] IS. YOUR WELL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I WOULD THINK IF IT'S AT AS A GAY COUPLE A MERRY GAY COUPLE. IN FAMILY LAW OFTEN ONE OF THE FACTORS IS IF YOU HAVE A TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD IT'S A PREFERENCE -- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD -- PREVENT EVEN IF THAT TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD IS EIGHTY MALE FEMALE. PARENT COMPARED TO EIGHT LGBT KILL OTHER PARENT BUT I THINK DOES THAT MAKE SENSE YES I THINK THE WITH THAT THAT THE BILL IS WRITTEN. IS THE FOCUS IS A WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD WHICH IS WHAT THE INPUT THE IMPORTANT PIECE IS AND SO THE PREFERENCE FOR A STABLE HOUSEHOLD. YES AS YOU MIGHT HAVE A SINGLE PARENT ANY MORE STABLE HOUSEHOLD RATHER THAN A TWO PARENT FAMILY BUT IF A TWO PARENT FAMILY IS IN THE BEST INTEREST YES AND WITH THIS BILL WOULD SAY IS. IS IF THAT'S A SAME SEX COUPLE OR OR NOT. THAT'S NOT RELEVANT RELEVANT TO THE QUESTION W. I JUST WANNA MAKE YEAH. I DON'T THINK I NEED TO RE SPANK YOU DID SUCH A GREAT. OTHER QUESTIONS MISS GALLAGHER AND I THINK MAYBE GETTING OUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS -- WHY NOT HAVE THE FREE I THINK THERE'S SOME PRISONERS SO LONG AS IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S EVIDENCE OF A DETRIMENT TO THE CHILD? YOU KNOW [inaudible] THE YOU KNOW WHAT SOMEONE IS SHOULD NOT MATTER -- ALWAYS THE COURT IS LOOKING AT WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD PERIOD. RIGHT -- BUT WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT WITHOUT SOME KIND OF I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS LANGUAGE AND MAYBE YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT -- THAT YOU KNOW THESE FAMILY LAW CASES BECOME VERY CONTENTIOUS RIGHT AND IF THERE'S A DECISION MADE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. SOME OF THE SAY WELL YOU DID IT BECAUSE OF THIS YOU KNOW. AND ALMOST LIKE LEADS TO LIKE MORE LITIGATION A MORE FIGHTS -- ACTUALLY RIGHT THAT IS KIND OF WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MAY RESPOND YES. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION -- THE WAY THAT THESE CUSTODY DETERMINATIONS WORK. WHEN A JUDICIAL OFFICER AND BY THE WAY THE JUDGES AND ALL OF THE FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST? OR FOR THE S. AND THAT IS IT ONE TOUGH GROUP TO GET TO AGREE OKAY THIS IS THE SANCTUM SANCTORUM OF THE BEST INTEREST. FOR THE CHILD. BUT I THINK THE QUESTION YOU'RE GETTING AT AND IT IS A REALLY SUBTLE DISTINCTION. WHAT IF SOMEBODY WALKS IN AND THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY APPROPRIATE GOAL INAPPROPRIATE GOING ON SEXUAL IT? UNDER THIS LAW IT DOES NOT MATTER WHO'S DOING IT I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE GAY STRAIGHT BI. OUT ANY TYPE OF LGBT Q.. IF THERE'S SOMETHING APPROPRIATE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE. WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT HERE IS NOT LABELING IT INAPPROPRIATE ME MERELY BECAUSE PERHAPS SOMEONE? DOESN'T LIKE GAYS RIGHT. THE TREATS EVERYBODY THE SAME. IN OTHER IF I CAN I THINK THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND THAT I I FEEL THIS IS [inaudible] APPROPRIATE. COULD HAVE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A WHILE AGO SOMETIMES WE DO THINGS THAT. THEY REALLY WEAK WE HAVE TO DO THIS. BUT IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THE FOCUS ON WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THAT CHILD. AND CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES OF THE PARENT. NOT RELEVANT WE WOULD NEVER SAY SOMEONE HAS BLACK HAIR BROWN HAIR. BLOOD HAIR IN IN IN LOOK AT SOME OTHER PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES SO. WE NEED TO GET A LITTLE BIT SMARTER ABOUT THIS AND LOOK AT WHAT'S AT THE PASSAGE THE CHILD. CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- AHEAD BEFORE YOU SB FIVE FOUR FOUR FIRST LET ME BEGIN BY BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR IMPROVING THE BILL THIS SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ARE MOST WELCOME AND I CERTAINLY ACCEPT THEM. THANK YOU. THE PURPOSE OF SB FIVE FOUR FOUR IS TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE -- WITH RESPECT TO APPLICANTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR. IF AN APPLICANT HAS A BLEMISH ON HIS OR HER RECORD SO FOR EXAMPLE -- IF YOU HAVE A SHOPLIFTING CONVICTION WHEN YOU'RE NINETEEN YEARS OLD -- AT THAT POINT TIME THE BAR ISSUE SIGNED A WAIVER WHICH RELEASES ALL YOUR RECORDS YOUR HEALTH RECORDS EMPLOYMENT RECORDS INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF. YOU HAVE BEEN OR WHILE IN LAW SCHOOL YOUR SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. BOB IF YOU CONSULT THE PSYCHIATRISTS OR COUNSELOR THOSE RECORDS ARE THEN SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE STATE BAR THE SAME IS TRUE IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE. PTSD FROM YOUR TIME IN MILITARY SERVICE OR FROM OTHER ANY OTHER REASON. WHAT WHAT? THE IMPACT OF THAT IS THE SECOND AND THIRD IMPACT IS THAT YOU MAY WILL NOT SEEK COUNSELING FOR FEAR OF HAVING. THOSE RECORDS EXPOSED OF THE EMBARRASSMENT THAT MAN SO SO THE PURPOSE OF SB FIVE FOUR FOUR IT IS SIMPLY. TO PREVENT. THE STATE BAR EXAMINERS AND STAFF FROM ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS UNLESS YOU PROVIDE THEM VOLUNTARILY IT'S A SIMPLE BILL.

SIX THIRTY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS SB SIX THIRTY WOULD GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE MUCH NEEDED TOOL IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. MANY OF US DON'T REALIZE THIS SCORED EXISTS IN OUR OWN BACKYARDS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES DRIVING DOWN A NORMAL CITY STREET. YOU MAY PASSED BY A PLACE THAT LOOKS LIKE. A MASSAGE PARLOR OR SOME OTHER PLACE OF SOME SERVICE THAT IS LEGITIMATE IN FACT. THERE'S THE EXPLOITATION HUMAN BEINGS GOING ON JUST LAST WEEK IN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. WE HAD A PLACE BUSTED -- THAT WAS EXPLOITING HUNDREDS OF WOMEN -- AND WE'VE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AS A STATE TO SAY THAT EVERY ONE OF THESE ESTABLISHMENTS HAS TO POST AT LEAST AT A MINIMUM HAS TO POST REQUIREMENTS. ABOUT -- OPPORTUNITIES FOR LIFELINE TO CALL THIS HOTLINE -- NOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY TEXT BE FREE TO THE HOT LINE IF YOU ARE IN THE POSITION OF SAFETY TO ACTUALLY CALL THE HOTLINE WE FOUND THIS TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE THE PROBLEM IS. FOLKS ARE POSTING THE POSTERS. THERE'S NO TOOLS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ENFORCE OUR STATE LAW. THIS BILL WOULD GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE OPTION NOT A MANDATE BUT AN OPTION TO ENFORCE -- THIS POSTER REQUIREMENT -- AND LOCAL ESTABLISHMENTS AND THAT'S BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS THAT'S AIRPORTS AND BUS STATIONS BUT WE'VE HAD BETTER BETTER COMPLIANCE THERE BUT MUCH WORSE IN MASSAGE PARLORS STRIP CLUBS IN OTHER PLACE THAT. YOU CAN IMAGINE -- I DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS VERY MUCH OPPOSITION BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND I HAVE YOUR MELANIE CUEVAS WITH ME WHO'S WITH THE COALITION AGAINST SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING. THANK. THERE IS A MOTION AND A SECOND FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING TURN NUMBERS MELANIE CUEVAS -- WITH CAN TUNNEL IT'S AN APARTMENT ON BEHALF OF CAST THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING. BASED IN LOS ANGELES IT'S THE LARGEST MOST COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE PROVIDER TO VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES -- I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE SENATOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS WELL AS ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING -- EFFORTS IN THE LEGISLATURE -- ALONG WITH THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF JEWISH WOMEN I'M CAST WAS A SPONSOR OF THE SB ELEVEN NINETY THREE AND TWO THOUSAND TWO WITH AND PART TIME SENATOR STEINBERG -- THOUGHT LEGISLATION WAS CRAFTED BASED ON INPUT OF SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAT VICTIMS ONE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION TO REACH OUT FOR HELP AND TO HAVE A LOT OF HESITATION IN CONTACTING GOVERNMENT OR LAW ENFORCEMENT HOTLINE. SURVIVORS WE WORKED WITH INDICATED THAT THEY BELIEVE THE HOTLY POSTERS AND PUBLIC PLACES WOULD HELP VICTIMS ACCESS THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO SEEK THE HELP. AND THE US ELEVEN NINETY THREE WAS BORN REQUIRING SPECIFIC BUSINESSES TO POST NOTICES IN PUBLIC PLACES WITH INFORMATION TO NGO OPERATE AT HOTLINES. SINCE THAT LEGISLATION WENT INTO A FACT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE HAVE WORKED WITH LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION AND AS THE SENATOR NOTED UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT FOUND THAT -- VOLUNTEERS OF AND CJ W. BOTH IN LOS ANGELES AND SACRAMENTO REVEALED THAT LESS THAN 30% OF BUSINESSES IN BOTH REGIONS ACTUALLY HAD THE POSTERS UP. DESPITE REPEATED DOES HAVE VISITS BY THE VOLUNTEERS. SO IN LIGHT OF THAT LACK OF COMPLIANCE THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE FOR CITY OR COUNTY TO SEEK ENFORCEMENT OF THESE PROVISIONS. DUE TO THE LACK OF CLARITY AND ELEVEN NINETY THREE WERE PRESENTING A SIMPLE SOLUTION AND SB SIX THIRTY WHICH ALLOWS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TAILOR ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO USE THEIR RESOURCES MOST EFFECTIVELY. LASTLY GIVEN THE NEED FOR VICTIMS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION AND THE DESIRE FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS HAVE ACCESS AS REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS LEGISLATION ON BEHALF OF THE MANY VICTIMS THAT WE SERVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING MORNINGSTAR CHAIR MEMBERS I APPRECIATE YOUR WAITING WE'LL STILL LITTLE OUT OF BREATH HERE MAKE IN THE RAIN. IF I COULD ASK THE SERGEANT TO HELP. DISTRIBUTE THESE PHOTOS FOR SUPPORT ONE OF MY WITNESSES. SO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. SENATE BILL SIX FORTY FIVE PROTECTS DYING VICTIMS WHO SUFFER FROM TO SPECIFIC DISEASES. MESOTHELIOMA AND SILICOSIS. FROM DAYS AND DAYS OF ABUSE OF DEPOSITIONS QUESTIONING IN CIVIL CASES. THIS BILL ADDRESSES A RECURRING PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM EXISTS BECAUSE OF AN UNINTENDED LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT LAW. AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE ENACTED IN TWENTY TWELVE LIMITED MOST DEPOSITIONS TO SEVEN HOURS. THE SAME IS IN FEDERAL MATTERS. AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND NATIONALLY COVERED ALL CIVIL CASES. BUT AFTER DISCUSSIONS AND HEARINGS THE LEGISLATURE AMENDED THE BILL TO INCLUDE VERY SIX SECTIONS TO THE SEVEN HOUR LIMIT. EXCEPTIONS FOR EXPERT AND OTHER SPECIALIZED WITNESSES FOR ALL EMPLOYMENT CASES AND FOR COMPLEX CASES. HOWEVER IT WAS NEVER THE INTENT. TO EXEMPT DYING PATIENTS FROM THE SEVEN HOUR LIMIT. AND SUBJECT THEM TWO DAYS AND DAYS OF CROSS EXAMINATION. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IT'S NOT HUMANE. DESPITE CURRENT LAW. DEPOSITIONS OF END STAGE MESOTHELIOMA PATIENTS ALMOST ALWAYS INVOLVE TWENTY HOURS OR MORE. OF QUESTIONING BY DEFENDANTS. THIS IS BECAUSE CURRENT LAW INCLUDES A LOOPHOLE. A LOOPHOLE WHICH ALLOWS ONE SIZE FITS ALL CASE MANAGEMENT ORDERS TO OVERRIDE EVERYTHING IN THE LAW. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF IS CLOSE TO DYING. I UNDERSTAND THAT SEVEN HOURS OF ON THE RECORD INTERROGATION OF A DYING. MESOTHELIOMA PATIENT OR SILICOSIS PATIENT IS STRESSFUL BECAUSE IT GENERALLY TAKES A FULL TWO OR THREE DAYS OF TIME. SEVEN HOURS OF DEPOSITION. TAKES TWO OR THREE DAYS TO COMPLETE. YOU HEAR SEVEN HOURS YOU THINK OF THAT SAID DAY OF DEPOSITION. NO WE'RE TALKING TWO OR THREE DAYS TO COMPLETE SEVEN HOURS OF DEPOSITION. SENATE BILL SIX FORTY FIVE LIMITS DEPOSITIONS OF DYING MESOTHELIOMA AND SILICOSIS PATIENTS TO SEVEN HOURS. IN ADDITION THE COURT IN ITS DISCRETION MAY GRANT UP TO THREE MORE DEPOSITION HOURS UPON REQUEST BY DEFENSE COUNSEL IN THE INTEREST OF FAIRNESS. AS LONG AS THE HEALTH OF THE DEPONENT DOES NOT APPEAR ENDANGERED BY THE GRANT OF ADDITIONAL TIME. YOUR HILL FOR MY ROUTE YOU'LL HEAR FROM MY WITNESSES THIS MORNING MICHELLE PROXMIRE. WHO IS THAT OUR FATHERS DEPOSITION IN A TYPICAL CASE? HE WAS DEPOSED FOR TWELVE DAYS. HIS ATTORNEYS TRIED TO USE EXISTING LAW TO LIMIT THE INTERROGATION. BUT THE COURT APPLIED ITS CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER IN WOULD NOT ALLOW ANY LIMITATIONS. IS MICHELLE REPORT. THE TWELVE DAY DEPOSITION. WAS EXTREMELY DEBILITATING AND WAS CONCLUDED ON HIS DEATH BED IN THEIR OWN HOME. WHERE THE DEFENSE COUNSEL CAME? YOU WILL ALSO HEAR FROM JEREMY SMITH AT THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. WHO REPRESENTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKERS EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS AND SILICA? MEMBER SENATE BILL SIX FORTY FIVE IT'S A NARROW BILL. IT WILL GREATLY HELP VICTIMS OF THE DAY OF THESE TO SPECIFIC DISEASES ONLY. BECAUSE THESE DISEASES ARE EXTRAORDINARILY PAINFUL AT THE END OF LIFE. IT WILL SURE THESE VICTIMS ARE TREATED HUMANELY IN THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM. DURING THE LAST WEEKS OF THEIR LIVES. AND JUST BEFORE I CLOSE. SOME OF RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT COMPROMISED OFFERS. BY THE OPPONENTS YOU'LL HEAR FROM THEM. LAST YEAR -- THEY OPPOSED A BILL THAT HAD AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HOURS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE DAYS. AND NOW THEY PROPOSE THAT AS A POSSIBLE COMPROMISE WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW MEMBERS. IN THESE CASES. IF THE PLAINTIFF DIES BEFORE THE CASE IS CONCLUDED. FAMILY MEMBERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PAIN AND SUFFERING DAMAGES. ONLY MEDICAL DAMAGES. SO YOU'VE GOT A SYSTEM WITH A BUILT IN. INCENTIVE TO DRAG OUT THE DISCOVERY PROCESS TO DRAG OUT THE DEPOSITION PROCESS. BECAUSE IT LIMITS WHAT THE DEFENDANTS HAVE TO PAY OUT IF THEY CAN RUN OUT THE CLOCK. IN THE PLAINTIFF DIES THANK YOU. BEFORE THE COMPLETION. IT'S A BILL TEN FLAW IN THE SYSTEM WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT A LIMITED UNIVERSE. THESE ARE A SMALL NUMBER OF CASES EACH YEAR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I KNOW MORE THAN A HUNDRED CASES PER YEAR. AGAIN THE DEFINITION IN THIS BILL. A DOCTOR HAS TO CONCLUDE AND PROVIDE WRITTEN INSTRUCTION TO THE COURT. THAT THE PATIENT THE PLAINTIFF HAS LESS. THEN SIX MONTHS TO LIVE. AND FINALLY I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME SOME OF THE INTERROGATORIES FROM A CASE. PLAINTIFFS HAVE TO RESPOND TO WRITTEN INTERROGATORIES BEFORE THE DEPOSITIONS. ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY WORK WHAT THEY WORKED WITH. TENURE OF WORK POSITIONS HELD. NUMBERS OF DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS. THAT THE OPPONENTS WHO ARGUE WELL THESE ARE MULTI DEFENDING CASES AND YOU'RE GONNA LIMIT. THE DUE PROCESS THEIR ABILITY TO CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES. THEY CAN ASK ANY QUESTION THEY WANT. IN INTERROGATORIES THEY OFTEN JUST REPEAT. THE INTERROGATORY QUESTIONS WITH THE PATIENT OFTEN IN THEIR DEATH BED TO DRAG OUT THE CLOCK. WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO PRESENT. OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF STARTING WITH MICHELLE BROCK MEYER. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. MY NAME IS MICHELLE BROOKMEYER. RICHARD LLOYD SMITH WAS MY FATHER. HE WORKED AS A DRY WHILE OTHER HIS ENTIRE ADULT LIFE. WE HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM AT HOME WHEN I WAS YOUNG. HIS HEIR CRUSTY WITH WHITE DRYWALL JOINT COMPOUND KICKED IN IT. SOME OF THEM WITH MY BROTHER AND I ON HIS LAP. LITTLE DID HE KNOW THAT THE MATERIAL HE USE STATED A FOR SO MANY YEARS. WOULD CAUSE HIS DEATH YEARS LATER. AFTER HIS DOCTORS TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD MESOTHELIOMA. AND ONLY HAD A FEW MONTHS TO LIVE. MY FATHER CHOSE TO FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANIES THAT MADE MONEY. SELLING THE PRODUCTS. THE CAUSES CANCER. HE WAS A PROUD MAN AND INSISTED. THAT WE FIND A RESPECTABLE ATTORNEY. BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO TELL HIS STORY. HE THOUGHT. IT MIGHT HELP OTHERS IF WE CAN HOLD THE COMPANIES THAT CHOSE TO PROFIT. FROM SELL SELLING AS FAST AS CONTAINING TRAVEL PRODUCTS EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW IT WOULD KILL AND INJURE THOSE WHO USE THE PRODUCT. WE WERE TOLD THAT HIS CASE WOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS AN IS BEST OKAY AS COULD BE. THERE WERE TWENTY DEFENDANTS AND HIS ONLY EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS WAS FOR WORKING FROM WORKING AS A DRY WALLER. THE DEPOSITION STARTED IN A LOCAL HOTEL ROOM. IT HAD TO BE MOVED TO MY HOUSE. BECAUSE MY DYING FATHER COULD BETTER BE CARED FOR AT HOME. I WAS PRESENT FOR ALL OF THE DEPOSITION BECAUSE I WAS MY FATHER'S CHARACTER. MY DAD COULD ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES AT A TIME. AND THEN HE WOULD NEED A BREAK. TO TAKE MEDICINE. OSPREY THE MUCUS THAT CONSTANTLY GATHERED IN HIS MOUTH FROM HIS LUNGS. USE THE RESTROOM. AND TRY TO GATHER STRENGTH AND FOCUS TO INDOOR THE NEXT FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF QUESTIONING. THE LAWYERS FOR THE AS FAST AS DEFENDANTS INTERROGATED MY FATHER FOR TWELVE DAYS ACROSS SIX WEEKS. AS HE WENT IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. INSTEAD OF ASKING HIM STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTIONS LIKE DID YOU WORK WITH OUR PRODUCTS. THEY ASKED HIM UNLESS QUESTIONS. LIKE WHETHER HE COULD REMEMBER EVERY BUILDING OR A DRESS THAT HE EVER STEPPED IN AND OUT OF IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT THEIR GOAL WAS TO SEE IF HE COULD SURVIVE THE DEPOSITION. HIS ATTORNEY ADVISED US THAT IF HE DID NOT COMPLETE THE DEPOSITION NO MATTER HOW LONG IT LASTED. THE JUDGE WOULD LIKELY EXCLUDE ALL OF HIS TESTIMONY FROM BEING USED AT TRIAL -- ATTORNEY EVEN US THE JUDGE TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE AS FAST AS DEFENDANTS. INTERROGATED MY FATHER. TO FOURTEEN HOURS. THE DEFENDANTS WOULDN'T STOP AND THE JUDGE DIDN'T LIMIT THE TIME. MY DAD'S ENTIRE GOAL IN LIFE. TURN TO FOCUSING TO SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THE ANALYST OPPOSITION [inaudible] HE DID [inaudible] I LESS THAN A WEEK LATER. YOU HAVE PICTURES OF MY DOG. AS HE BEGAN THE DEPOSITION. AND A PICTURE OF THE LAST DAY OF THE DEPOSITION. THE DEFENDANT LAWYERS TOOK. THE DEFENDANTS LAWYERS TOOK EVERY STRATEGIC. ADVANTAGE THE CODE. BUT IT WAS INHUMANE TO ALLOW THEM TO INTERROGATE. MY JOB THIS WHITE. I DON'T BLAME THE LAWYERS FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CURRENT RULES. BUT I HOPE THAT HIS SUFFERING. AND MY RETELLING OF IT. CAN HELP CHANGE THE RULES AND PROTECT OTHERS IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S WHERE MY WHAT MY DAD. HOPE TO DO. MIGHT EVEN BRING IN A CASE HE WANTED TO BRING OUT HOW UNFAIR IT WAS. THAT HE WAS WORKING WITH A DANGEROUS. DEATH INDUCING PRISON WITHOUT ANY WARNING. HE HOPED HE COULD PROTECT OTHER WORKERS IN THE FUTURE. AND I HOPE TO HELP THEM AS WELL. IF THEY ARE DYING AND FACED IN HUMANE DEPOSITIONS. I ASK FOR YOUR HELP IN TURN. THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANKS WITH US PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH HERE BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL -- WE REPRESENT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE AT ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE SICK AND DYING. A WORKERS WHO IN THE COURT SYSTEM NOW AND THE UNDEAD REALLY THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. TO ASBESTOS OR SILICON THEIR CAREERS. WHAT'S NOT A LARGE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO ARE STRUCK WITH THESE TWO DISEASES. THESE THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY PAINFUL WAYS TO DIE. THERE IS NO CURE FOR EITHER AND THE VICTIM DROWNED SO DEATH. WITH MESOTHELIOMA. AND SUFFOLK OR SUFFER GETS THE DEATH WITH SILICOSIS. AND THESE VICTIMS SHOULDN'T BE VICTIMIZED TWICE AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE BEING EXPOSED TO TOXIC THAT WERE KILLED IN PAINFULLY IN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS. OR KILL THEIR SPOUSES OR CHILDREN. BECAUSE THEY BROUGHT THE HAZARDOUS ASBESTOS FIBERS. WERE STILL THE CRYSTAL HOME WHEN THEY'RE CLOSE. SB SIX FORTY FIVE IS ABOUT TRAIN HUMANELY IN THEIR FINAL DAYS. WHAT'S NOT HUMANE AS THE UNNECESSARY STRESS OF ABUSE OF DEPOSITIONS WHEN THESE VICTIMS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND JUSTICE IN THE CIVIL COURT SYSTEM AND HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THE ENTITIES THAT BUT OTHER ILLNESSES. DEPOSITIONS ARE STRESSFUL FOR THOSE WHO ARE HEALTHY AND EXPONENTIALLY MORE SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE DYING [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY. WE'VE SEEN DEPOSITIONS TAKE HOURS. UNLESS YOU PUT A LIMIT ON THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR CASES WITH THE PLAN IF WE WILL DIE WITHIN SIX MONTHS [inaudible] SB -- AS SB SIX FORTY FIVE DOES. THE COOLEY CAN NEVER BE ENOUGH TIME. THE OPPOSED TO ARGUE ABOUT DUE PROCESS THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS NO MATTER HOW MANY DEFENDANTS THERE ON THE CASES. BECAUSE OF THE VERY MOMENT THE CASES FILED. THERE'S A COMPLETE EXCHANGE OF EVERY DOCUMENT REALLY RELEVANT TO THE CASE IN EXISTENCE EMPLOYMENT RECORDS SOCIAL SECURITY RECORDS. AND MEDICAL RECORDS. THERE'S ALSO AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AT THE VICTIMS MUST ANSWER IN WRITING FROM THE DEFENDANT'S. ABOUT EVERYTHING THEY MIGHT REMEMBER. AND THEY FILL OUT THE ANSWERS WITH HELP. FROM THE DOCUMENT A WORK HISTORY SO THEY WILL MAKE FEWER MISTAKES IN ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS IN WRITING. THEY WHEN THEY ARE IN THE LIVING ROOM. LOOK AT THE OXYGEN. STRUGGLING TO BREATHE IN PAIN. SURROUNDED BY DEFENSE ATTORNEYS. AND THE LAST WEEKS OF THEIR LIVES. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE LEARN FOR ANOTHER TEN HOURS A DEPOSITIONS? WE BELIEVE NOTHING. THERE'S NOTHING THAT THESE VICTIMS CAN SAY IN THOSE DEPOSITIONS THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN ASKED IN THE UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF QUESTIONS ANSWERED BEFORE. THE DEPOSITION ABOUT EVERY PLACE THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND YOU EXPOSE THEM. AND SHOULD SOMETHING UNFORESEEN COME UP WITH THE INITIAL SEVEN HOURS OF DEPOSITION TIME. SOMETHING ANY THE CLARIFICATION. MORE WRITTEN QUESTIONS CAN BE ASKED. AND THE JUDGE OVERSEEING THE CASE CAN GRANT THREE MORE HOURS. IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT SEVEN HOURS IS REALLY THREE OR FOUR DAYS. SINCE THESE VICTIMS CAN ONLY BE DEPOSED FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME GIVEN THEIR DETERIORATING CONDITION. THIS BILL IS ABOUT TREATING VICTIMS HE MAINLY DURING THE FINAL DAYS I URGE YOUR I'VE OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION THINK WESTERMAN KEITH DONE ON BEHALF OF THE DISTRICT COUNCIL HIRE WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE PROUD CO SPONSORS. JUST REAL BRIEF LAST ONE OF I'M SORRY WE'RE NOT CAN TAKE WORK FOR THE TESTIMONY WERE JUST THAT ASKING FOR SUPPORT I APPRECIATE THAT I'LL JUST TELL YOU THAT THIS IS THESE ARE HIGH IN ADDITION TO TRADESMEN AND WOMEN THERE ALSO HOSPICE. THEY'VE GOT A PATIENTS THE THIS BILL AFFECTS PATIENT THANK WILL BE DEAD BY CHRISTMAS WAS NOT WE NEED TO REMEMBER EITHER TAKE THE MONEY WE'RE JUST TAKING SUPPORT PLEASE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS THE AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION MACHINISTS AND UTILITY WORKERS UNION ON SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE WE'LL% WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO HERE STRONG SUPPORT. DANIEL TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. MATT CRIMMINS ONLY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA THAT A CONFERENCE OF OPERATING ENGINEERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. CAN YOU DON'T YOU DROWNED WITH THE CITY COUNCIL LABORS ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST MY CONSUMERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS LAND TRITON ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL WE THINK THE AUTHOR AND WITNESSES AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. I'M CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FRIEND TRIBERG FOR THE LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL LAWYERS GUILD AND WE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SEE NONE OPPOSITION THIS RETURN MEMBERS MIKE BULLARD ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL IN CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA -- WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR AND WE UNDERSTAND THE EXTREMISTS POSITION THAT THESE PLAINTIFFS ARE IN I HAD A GOOD FRIEND DIED OF MESOTHELIOMA AND IT WAS A HORRIBLE WAY TO GO. THAT HAPPEN TO BE IDIOPATHIC THEY COULD NOT TRACE IT TO ANY. EXPOSURE TO ANYTHING BUT MOST ME SO CASES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PAST US AND WE UNDERSTAND IT. AT THE SAME TIME. DEFENDANTS DON'T DECIDE HOW MANY DEFENDANTS ARE NAMED IN A CASE. THAT DECISION IS MADE BY PLAINTIFFS. AND IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR THESE CASES TO INVOLVE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF DEFENDANTS. BECAUSE THERE CAN BE MULTIPLE AVENUES OF EXPOSURE YOU COULD HAVE WORKED ON A SHIP. THEN YOU COULD HAVE WORKED ON YOUR OWN BREAKS AND DEALT WITH THE IT'S BEST DOES CONTAINING BRAKE PADS THEN YOU COULD HAVE DONE HOME IMPROVEMENT WORK ON YOUR OWN HOUSE. THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO BE EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS AND LOTS OF DEFENDANTS ARE NAMED. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SUBSTITUTES WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER WHERE JUDGES WHO DO THIS EVERY DAY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAVE UNIFORMLY SAID WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE DEFAULT OF TWENTY HOURS. IT CAN BE REDUCED OR INCREASED AT THE MOTION OF THE PARTIES AND WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE IT. TO SEVEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN A SPELL SPELLS LAWYER AND I'M NOT. TO INTUITIVELY UNDERSTAND THAT DEPOSITIONS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT IF THERE'S FIFTY DEFENDANTS THAN IF THERE'S FIVE THE QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE ASKED IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A MOTION TO DISMISS OR MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT AT SEVEN HOURS YOU HAVE AN ACTUAL DUE PROCESS VIOLATION FOR DEFENDANTS. BECAUSE THEY MAY WELL NOT GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THE QUESTIONS THEY NEED TO ASK. TO SUPPORT THEIR MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT BY THE TIME THESE GET TO TRIAL THERE ARE USUALLY NOT FIFTY DEFENDANTS THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR BECAUSE THIS PROCESS HAS WEEDED OUT PEOPLE. WHO DON'T BELONG IN THAT CASE? WE HAVE MADE COMPROMISED OFFERS. WHAT THE WITNESS AND?% LORD I FEEL SORRY FOR HER EXPERIENCE WITH HER FATHER. BUT SHE ASKED FOR FOURTEEN THAT IT BE LIMITED TO FOURTEEN HOURS AND IRONICALLY THAT IS THE COMPROMISE OFFER THAT WE MADE TO GO TO WOULD DEFAULT PROVISION OF FOURTEEN WE BELIEVE. THAT THIS THING COULD BE COMPROMISED AND A HUMANE RULE ESTABLISHED THAT DOES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SHEER NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES. SO WE WOULD ASK THAT THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR CONTINUE T NEGOTIATE WITH US SO THAT WE CAN COME TO A FAIR MIDDLE GROUND ON THIS. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. OF SUPPLY. MARK SEVEN WITH AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALLY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEVEN TAYLOR WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU SENATOR OF FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND AND TO THE THE WITNESS AS MY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS AND PAIN YOU SUFFERED -- AN IN. WELL WHEN I WHEN I AND I BROOKS DEFENSE ATTORNEY BUT IN CRIMINAL LAW WHICH IS I KNOW VERY VERY DIFFERENT. BUT IN OFTENTIMES -- HIM WHETHER WHETHER IT'S WORKPLACE HISTORY WHAT HAVE YOU -- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY TIME IN PLACE ISSUES WHAT HAVE YOU THEIR OF THERE WAS. TESTIMONY THAT WAS GARNERED IN AND THE OTHER WAS STATEMENTS OR NECESSARY FROM A NUMBER OF WITNESSES. I IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THESE KINDS OF CASES THE PLAINTIFFS THEMSELVES OF FOR THE MOST PART THEY'RE NOT THE SCIENTISTS -- AND THEY MAY HAVE SOME RECOLLECTION PRICE PUT OUT SOME RECOLLECTION OF WHERE THEY WORK. BUT BUT WHICH WOULD BE OF THE THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT IS CRITICAL AYE AYE THE MAGIC OF THESE KINDS OF CASES AS WELL AS THE SCIENTIFIC -- OVER A BASIS WHERE THE EXPERT TESTIMONY ON BOTH SIDES WOULD COME IN AND I EXPERT WITNESSES I KNOW PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THESE TYPES OF CASES. BUT IT THE I GUESS THE QUESTION OR THE COMMENT SLASH QUESTION IS WHEN I WHEN I WOULD CAN GARNER SOMEONE'S WORK HISTORY OF ME WOULD USUALLY TAKE ME. A MINUTE TWO MINUTES. MAYBE FOR FIVE MINUTES WELL IT WAS A CRITICAL. ASPECT OF THE CASE. AND I WOULD GET A BUSINESS RECORDS INDICATING WHERE TEY WORKED IT WAS US TRULY CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE CASE PARTICULARLY BUT HAVE TO DO WITH TIME LOCATION REGARDING A PARTICULAR ABOVE. SUBURB OF TIME OF AN INCIDENT AGAIN I UNDERSTAND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT INCOME OVER TO CIVIL AND I KNOW THAT ESPECIALLY TALKING ABOUT. SOMEONE IN A OF A DECADES OF HISTORY WHETHER IT'S WORK HISTORY OR AS THE OPPOSITION TO CASE MAYBE THINGS AT HOME THAT THEY MADE WORKED ON WHAT HAVE YOU -- BUT IT BUT I GUESS -- THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES IN EVIDENCE CODE TO GET SOME OF THE KEY. INFORMATION NECESSARY -- THAT A PLAINTIFF BUT PERSONALLY HAVE -- AS OPPOSED TO WHERE YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU CAN GET FROM. RECORDS. AND SO I I I I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS WHAT IS TAKING ANOTHER NUMBER DEFENDANTS. BUT I'VE BEEN IN MULTIPLE DEFENDANT CASES WHERE A JUDGE WILL. LIMIT THE MATH TEST. AT THE SAME THING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN BOUGHT OUT BY TWO OR THREE DEPENDENTS. SO I I GUESS WHAT IS TAKING SO MUCH TIME. SO THAT I COULD -- I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION TO GET TO A WHAT IS TAKING SO MUCH TIME WHY SO MUCH TIME NECESSARY AND I'M HAPPY TO HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES AND IN THAT REGARD. WELL LET ME LEAD OFF. OTHERS MAY WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL. BUT AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THIS I THINK. WITHIN YOUR QUESTION. THE ADVANCE DISCOVERY PRIOR TO THE DEPOSITIONS BEING TAKEN. IS VOLUMES OF INTERROGATORIES AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY THE MORE ACCURATE RECORD WHEN A PLAINTIFF HAS TO RECONSTRUCT. THE STREET ADDRESS OF THE BUILDING HERE SHE WAS WORKING AT FOR TWO WEEKS OR TWO MONTHS -- WHEN THEY'RE ON THEIR DEATH BED IN YOU ASKED THE QUESTION THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED AN INTERROGATORY THE GOAL OF THAT QUESTION IN THE DEPOSITION IS TO TRIP IT'S TO TRY TO GET THE PLAINTIFF TO MAKE A MISTAKE? IN THE STREET ADDRESS. WHERE THE BUILDING LOCATION WAS THAT BUILDING LOCATION? IS THAT THE ONE YOU WORKED AT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX OR WAS THAT THE ONE YOU WORKED OUT IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN COM. WITH THE ISSUE OF MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS. THERE'S NOTHING THAT PREVENTS DEFENDANTS FROM COLLABORATING AND COOPERATING THEY'RE DEFENDING THEIR OWN INTEREST OBVIOUSLY IN THEIR OWN CLIENT. BUT THEY CAN ALSO WORK TOGETHER TO PRIORITIZE -- AREAS OF QUESTIONING IN IN DEPOSITION THAT CAN BE HELPFUL. TO ALL OF THEM ARE A GROUP OF THEM. NOTHING PREVENTS THAT COORDINATION IN BEING EFFICIENT IN DEPOSITIONS. BUT THE GROUND THAT'S BEING COVERED IN TRYING. WE HAVE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE BROKEN THAT ARE ALLOWING WHAT HAPPENED. TO MISS BROUGHT MYERS FATHER ANA AN ABSOLUTE ABUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS I BELIEVE TO TAKE SOMEBODY IN THEIR FINAL DAYS OF LIFE. AND AS WAS STATED BY HER FATHER HIS GOAL WAS TO SURVIVE THE DEPOSITION. TO PROTECT HIS FAMILY IN HIS HONOR -- THERE'S NOTHING SET MEMBERS SEVEN HOURS TRANSLATES TO TWO OR THREE DAYS OF CONVENING A DEPOSITION. THE BILL BEFORE YOU. GRANT SEVEN HOURS. IT ALLOWS A JUDGE TO EXTEND IT BY THREE HOURS WHICH COULD BE ANOTHER DAY OR MAYBE TWO DAYS EVEN DEPENDING. ON HOW WEAK THE DEPONENT IS -- WE BELIEVE IT PROTECTS DUE PROCESS. AND REMEMBER THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT. THE DUE PROCESS. IN HUMAN DIGNITY. OF PLAINTIFFS IN THESE CASES. OPPOSITION WAS ALSO LAST DAM -- THAT QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- YOU KNOW FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'VE LISTENED. TO DEFENSE LAWYERS COMPLAIN ABOUT PLAINTIFFS IN PLAINTIFFS COMPLAIN ABOUT DEFENSE AND I IN OUR AND I'M NOT. HERE TO DEFEND HOW MS BROCK MYERS FATHER WAS TREATED I DON'T KNOW THE FACTS OF THAT. I DO KNOW WHAT MY DEFENSE LAWYERS SAY ABOUT THE UTILITY OF INTERROGATORIES AND THEY TELL ME. THAT THE INTERROGATIVE RESPONSE TO INTERROGATORIES THEY GET IS NOT HELPFUL. IN MANY CASES THAT THEY ARE MERE RECITATIONS OF WHAT WAS IN THE COMPLAINT AND THEY DON'T GET DOWN TO THE GRANULARITY. AND REMEMBER ON IN ITS BEST DOES CASE IT REALLY IS ALL ABOUT -- EXPOSURE IDENTIFICATION THERE'S NO QUESTION OF CAUSATION THERE'S NO QUESTION OF DAMAGE WEATHER COULD BE QUESTIONS OF DAMAGES BUT THERE'S REALLY NO QUESTION. IF YOU ARE EXPOSED TO THE PRODUCT AND YOU HAVE MESOTHELIOMA YOU'RE GOING TO BE SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE LIABLE SO IT'S ALL ABOUT EXPERTS WHOSE PRODUCT YOU WERE EXPOSED. TO AND WE ARE TOLD THAT THE RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES. ARE NOT HELPFUL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THAT'S YOUR QUESTION WHICH CAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE STRESS. I'M SORRY MR HOLDEN. AND THE ADDRESS REALLY JUST PICKING UP ON THE LAST QUESTION WE WERE REALLY TO UNDERSTAND THE YOU YOU SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN NEGOTIATIONS IRAQ I'M CLEAR ON WHAT THE BILL IS SAYING IN TERMS OF THE TIME FRAME JUST REMIND ME WHAT IS. THE PLACE THAT THE OPPOSITION IS LANDING IN TERMS OF WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF THE COMPROMISE BECAUSE I'M RIGHT. I'M SURE IT'S BEEN SAID BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME NOW AND LET ME JUST ALSO SAY. THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO. IS IT THAT'S NOT DISPUTED THAT THEY HAVE -- THIS ELEMENT RIGHT AND THEY WORKED AROUND. A PRODUCT THAT. MORE THAN LIKELY WAS THE BECAUSE HE SAID THAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN. J. WORKING IN THE GARAGE OR DOING SOME OTHER THINGS BUT I THINK THAT -- THERE'S A LARGER UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE THE NATURE OF THEIR JOB OR WHAT THEY WERE WORKING AROUND AS BEST AS WAS MORE THAN LIKELY THE COSTS OF NOW. THE LAWSUITS BEEN FILED WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS THE AUTHOR HAS A AND THE WITNESS HAVE MADE WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER PRETTY COMPELLING ARGUMENT. THAT -- THE THE PROCESS OF GETTING. TO THE GRANULARITY OF THE ISSUE IS KIND OF RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE AT THE END OF LIFE. AND SO. WE'RE DOWN TO A PLACE WHERE -- THE BILL SAYS SEVEN HOURS. WHICH TRANSLATES INTO. A NUMBER OF DAYS -- THE JUDGE HAS THE RIGHT TO EXTEND IT. FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE SEEING IS. NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THAT -- AS BEEN DESCRIBED TO FOR EVERYONE TO GET TO THE PLACE OF THE TRUTH. THROUGH THE CHAIR. OF THIS ROLE IN THANKS -- THE OFFER THAT WE MADE TWO YEARS AGO WAS A DEFAULT OF FOURTEEN HOURS INSTEAD OF TWENTY WHICH WAS THE AMOUNT THAT APPARENTLY OF THE LAWYERS IN THIS CASE ASK -- FOR WITH THE ABILITY OF THE PLAINTIFF TO MOVE FOR LESS TIME AND THE DEFENSE TO MOVE FOR MORE. A WE WERE TOLD THAT THE CONCERN WAS TE REIMPOSITION OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER WHICH WOULD RENDER THE BILL OR LAW MOOT -- SO WE SAID NO -- YOU COULDN'T USE A CASE MANAGEMENT ORDERED A VERY IT HE WOULD HAVE TO INDIVIDUALLY EVALUATE EACH CASE -- THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERN THAT THE INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION IS NOT OCCURRING AND WE WOULD DO WHAT WE COULD IN THE BILL. TO REQUIRE THAT. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR COMPROMISE OF COURSE THAT'S NOT MY CALL THAT'S YOURS. BUT I THOUGHT A REDUCTION FROM TWENTY TO FOURTEEN WAS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION AND THAT WOULD BE THE DEFAULT. OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED YOU COULD HAVE SOME SORT OF SLIDING SCALE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS AGAIN WE DON'T CHOOSE WE MAY BE DEFENDED. SIXTY TWO AND SO MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME MINIMUM AMOUNT PER DEFENDANT. WE ARE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS -- BEFORE GIVEN THE CHANCE. AND IF I MIGHT THROUGH THE CHAIR RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION AS WELL. YEAH IF THE THIS QUESTION WAS FOR BOTH YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. ON I WOULD REMIND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT. THE BILL THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO LAST YEAR WAS SEVEN HOURS PLUS. SEVEN FOURTEEN HOURS THAT WAS OPPOSED BY THE PEOPLE HERE PROPOSING. THAT AMENDMENT NOW I WOULD ASK THROUGH THE CHAIR. IF THE OPPOSITION WOULD CONSIDER REMOVING ANA WOULD PAY PAIN AND SUFFERING EVEN IF THE PLAINTIFF DIES. DURING THE DEPOSITION WITH DATE WELCOME AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW THE FAMILY TOOK ROOT RECOVER FOR PAIN AND SUFFERING WHICH THEY'RE CURRENTLY. DENIED WELL IT CHEN FOR NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE. THINGS THAT ARE NOT IN FRONT OF US OR REALLY TO GO TO THE TERMS OF THE BILL THAT THAT IS SOMETHING FROM. OUR STATE FOR THE COMMITTEE STANDPOINT THE QUESTION. DOES THIS BILL DESERVE TO MOVE FORWARD. AS IT IS KNOWING THAT THERE MAY BE. FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AND SOMETIMES COMMITTEE MEMBERS TAKE THOSE. ACT INTO ACCOUNT AS THEY'RE DECIDING ON A BILL FROM MY STANDPOINT IF YOU READ THE ANALYSIS I THINK WE'RE VERY CLEAR. GIVEN. THE INTERACTIONS GIVEN THE REALITIES OF THE SITUATION THAT SETTING A STANDARD THAT YOU'VE REQUESTED SENATOR IS. TO ME MEETS THE THE STANDARDS HERE FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS BILL. THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION BEFORE US. ANYTHING BEYOND THAT IS CERTAINLY UP TO YOU AND YOU CAN ENTERTAIN THAT BUT ANY BILL THAT GOES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE IF IT SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED AND DOES NOT MEET THE STANDARDS COMMITTEE MAY ALSO BE. DRAWN BACK IN THANK YOU. THERE ARE SERBS HOLD YOUR FOLLOW UP. JUST TO TIE UP MY POSITION ON IT I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL -- I WOULD ENCOURAGE. THAT KIND OF A CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE -- IT DOESN'T -- IMPACT ON MY WILLINGNESS TO BE WITH YOU TODAY -- AND QUITE FRANKLY MAY NOT IMPACT ON MY WILLINGNESS TO VOTE ON IT ON THE FLOOR BUT IT WOULD BE -- GOOD TO KNOW THAT THEIR SORT OF EFFORT TO TRY TO RECONCILE WHAT APPEARS TO BE. MAYBE FOUR HOURS -- AND SOME OTHER CONDITIONS AROUND THE SMALL THANK YOU THANKS. SERVICE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE TERMINALLY ILL. WHO HAVE SIX MONTHS TO LIVE -- THIS IS AFTER INTERROGATORIES AND THERE CAN BE A REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL INTERROGATORIES SO THAT THIS IS DONE WITH THE HELP OF THE LAWYERS AND WITH IT -- AND IT IT'S ALWAYS VERY HELPFUL WHEN THEY'RE UNION RECORDS. AND SO YOU KNOW THIS IS THE ONE TIME WHEN IT'S THE BEST IF YOU HAVE YOUR UNION YOU BEEN WORKING THROUGH THROUGH THE UNION. THE UNION IS ABLE TO PROVIDE -- ALL OF THE RECORD SO THAT IT'S MUCH EASIER TO PRESENT THE CASE -- THE BIGGEST PROBLEM COURSES THE LATENCY PERIOD BETWEEN THE TIME YOU EXPOSED IN THE TIME. THE CHIU FINALLY ARE AT THE POINT WHERE YOU HAVE TO PRESENT THE THE THE LAWSUIT -- THE THE ONLY COMMENT THAT WAS MADE IN THE IN THE EIGHT ANALYSIS. ON PAGE. SEVEN THERE'S NO QUESTION I WAS SUPPORT THIS IT'S I IS AN ATTORNEY A IN WORKERS COMP I HAD TO BE INVOLVED IN THESE. CASES WHERE. DEPOSITIONS WERE TAKEN AND AT ONE DEFENSE COUNSEL. AFTER CASES FINALLY SETTLED TELL ME THEY WERE -- HOPING MY CLIENT WOULD DIE IT WOULD. MAKE IT MUCH EASIER NOT THAT THEY WERE HOPING MICHAEL I WOULD DIE THAT THEY WERE EXPECTING HE WOULD PROBABLY DIE AND THEN IT WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING. THE COMMENTS REGARDING DUE PROCESS IN MAKING SURE THE DEFENDANTS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO TO BECAUSE EACH ONE FOR EACH ONE IS DEFENDING THEIR OWN CLIENT. THEY WANT TO GET THEIR CLIENT OUT OF THAT LAWSUIT. AND IT BECOMES A QUESTION OF DUE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER DOESN'T BELONG TO THE LAWSUIT GETS TAKEN OUT -- AND THE ONLY WAY THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE IS TO DISCOVERY WEATHER'S INTERROGATORIES OR DEPOSITIONS -- THE COMMENT MADE IN THE ANALYSIS WAS. THAT AS THE BILL ADVANCES THAT TO THE AUTHOR SUPPORTERS MAY WISH TO ENGAGE -- WITH THE OPPONENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS A MIDDLE GROUND. THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD -- SUGGEST -- AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS -- BUT THERE SHOULD BE. THERE THERE SHOULD BE A PERIOD. AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE THERE SHOULD BE A A A DETERMINATE -- NUMBER OF HOURS THE SHOULD BE USED FOR FOR DISCOVERY ESPECIALLY WHEN A PERSON IS. AT THE END BUT I WOULD ASK THAT AS NOTED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS. THAT YOU MAY WANT TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. THANK YOU AND FOR THE RECORD OUR DOOR HAS BEEN OPENED THROUGHOUT. WE HAVE HIT -- IN PAST IN THE PAST -- WHERE THERE WAS OPPOSITION? FOR SEVEN PLUS. SEVEN WE BELIEVE IF I COULD JUST THROUGH THE CHAIR COME IN ON THE DUE PROCESS ISSUE. THAT -- WITH THAT THERE WAS THAT ACTUALLY QUESTION THERE IS DID YOU MISS REYES MENTOR. ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE DUE PROCESS ISSUE -- I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR SENATOR MUNNINGS -- COMMENTS REGARDING DUE PROCESS IF HE HAS. AS I THINK IT'S IT'S THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT. OF DEFENDANTS COUNSEL IS SOMEHOW BEING DENIED DUE PROCESS -- BUT FOR SOME OF THE REASONS YOU CITED AND FOR REASONS CITED EARLIER. THE CASE MANAGEMENT IN THESE CASES INVOLVES YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT TO GET CERTAIN RECORDS BECAUSE IT'S MANDATED. THAT EMPLOYMENT RECORDS OTHER% MEDICAL RECORDS THEY'RE ALL EXCHANGED READ AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CASE. SO IS INTERROGATORIES ARE DEVELOPED THEY CAN DRAW FROM THAT PRELIMINARY EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING TO GET MEDICAL RECORDS YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING TO GET EMPLOYMENT RECORDS. INTERROGATORIES FURTHER REFINE ON THAT EARLY INFORMATION EXCHANGE. THE PURPOSE OF DEPOSITION IS TO MAYBE CLARIFY WHAT IS NOT FULLY ANSWERED IN AN INTERROGATORY OR WHERE THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY -- BUT WHAT WE SEE IN THESE CASES IS AN INCENTIVE. TO ASK EVERY QUESTION IT'S LISTED IN AN INTERROGATORY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF RUNNING OUT THE TIME RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK. THERE'S A BUILT IN INCENTIVE TO PROTRACTED THE DEPOSITIONS. IT'S A FAULT IN THE LAW I BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LIMITED UNIVERSE OF TERMINALLY ILL DYING PATIENTS FOR WHOM WERE TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE. THAT I BELIEVE PROTECTS THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF NOT ONLY THE DEFENDANT'S. BUT ALSO OF THE PLAINTIFF TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE DUE PROCESS IN THAT LAWSUIT. WELL HAVING THE HUMAN DIGNITY AND RESPECT NOT TO HAVE TO BE QUESTIONED. IN THEIR DYING HOURS ADDRESS. IT APPEARS THEM THAT -- ONCE THE SIGNED BY BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME. THEN THERE WOULD BE A SHIFTING OF MORE ORGANIZATIONAL SIDE OF THE DEFENSE. TO HAVE A LEAD DEFENSE PERHAPS -- BUT AGAIN GOING BACK TO JUST THAT ONE SENTENCE IN THE ANALYSIS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU AS CHAIR OF THE CHAU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP. ALL I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY ARE YET I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE BOTH SIDES TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATING AND COMMUNICATING -- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENTS RAISED BY THE BOTH SIDES ON THE ONE HAND ARE THESE DEPOSITIONS COULD INDEED BE DEVASTATING. TO A WITNESS ARE AND HIS DEATH BED. AND OP ON THE OTHER HAND I I I I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE DEFICIENCIES OF SOME OF THESE IN WRITTEN INTERROGATORIES AS WELL AS TO TACTIC TO OUR STRATEGIES EMPLOY. ACCOUNTABLE BY SOME COUNCIL. YET I THINK BOB. IN CASES WHERE YOU HAVE MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS I THINK EACH ONE OF THEM. OUGHT TO BE GIVEN. AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND HIMSELF OR HERSELF -- ITSELF -- SAID THAT THE YOU KNOW THE THE PROCESS COULD BE COMPLETED. SO WHICH IS THE REASON WHY I WANT TO ENCOURAGE SHOP BOTH SIDES TO CONTINUE. ARE COMMUNICATING AND I THINK IT SOUNDED LIKE THERE MIGHT BE SOME ROOM ON BY IN NOT REACHING A COMPROMISE SO. I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT AND I ALSO FINALLY ONE THINK THE WIND IS FOR BEING HERE TODAY FOR SHARING. YOUR STORY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS ALL RIGHT SEE NONE CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR IN YOUR STAFF AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR INDULGENCE IN OBVIOUS CARE ATTENTION. TO WHAT'S A VERY SERIOUS QUESTION BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND BEFORE OUR STATE. I WOULD URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY -- WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT UNDER THE STATUS QUO -- DEFENDANTS ARE INCENTIVIZED TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK. SO TO SPEAK THAT IN OUR PRIOR NEGOTIATION EFFORTS AND I COMMIT WERE CONTINUE OR COMMITTED. TO LOOKING FOR COMPROMISE BUT AS I POINTED OUT -- THE BILL THAT WAS PUT UP LAST YEAR WAS OPPOSED -- TO ENDS. THAT WAS NOT ADEQUATE. TO MEET WHAT WE'RE NOW TOLD IS A LEGITIMATE COMPROMISED SO WE'RE PREPARED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT. I WOULD JUST FINALLY CLOSE BY SAYING WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A BALANCE IN A LIMITED UNIVERSE OF CASES. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PROBABLY IN THE AREA OF A HUNDRED WE'RE NOT TALKING THOUSANDS OF CASES. AS ONE OF THE WITNESSES STATED. PEOPLE TODAY WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH MESOTHELIOMA OR SILICOSIS. THEY WILL BE DEAD BY CHRISTMAS. THIS BILL WILL NOT PROTECT THEM. S. DEPOSITIONS ARE DRAGGED OUT UP TO THEIR POINT OF DEATH REWARDING. THE DEFENDANTS IF THEY DIE BEFORE THE CASE IS CONCLUDED. MEMBERS YOU'VE HEARD COMPELLING TESTIMONY -- FROM THE DAUGHTER OF A VICTIM. WE'VE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE HORRIFIC NATURE. OF THIS DISEASE [inaudible] THAT IS. ADMITTED TO BE CAUSED BY EXPOSURE. WE THINK WE'VE STRUCK THE BALANCE THAT PROTECTS THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF DEFENDANTS WERE PROTECTING.
