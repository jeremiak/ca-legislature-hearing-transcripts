HI GOOD ALL RIGHT WE'LL MOVE RIGHT INTO OUR HERE AND AND OUR FIRST PANELIST I GUESS WOULD BE -- NEXT NEXT ROTOR PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST FOR THE LA OWES OFFICE. GOOD MORNING WELCOME THIS IS AN OVERVIEW OF OF THE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RETIREMENT SYSTEM. MORNING AND WELCOME AND THANK YOU GOOD MORNING THIS IS THANK YOU -- IS. ONE OH ONE YEAH BEFORE YOU HEAR FROM THE ACTUARIES AND THE PEOPLE WHO ADMINISTER THE BENEFITS. FOR US PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA FIRST CAN PROVIDE SOME OVER VIEW OF EXIT ACCIDENTS IN MY NAME I NEXT ROTOR FOR THE LA -- BEFORE YOU HEAR FROM. FROM THE OTHER PEN -- PANELS -- I'M JUST PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF SOME COMMON ISSUES THAT THEY PROBABLY WILL BE TOUCHING ON DURING THEIR PRESENTATIONS AND JUST YOU HAVE KIND OF AN INITIAL. BACKGROUND OF SOME COMMON THEMES I'LL PROBABLY CROSSOVER AMONG THE VARIOUS. PRESENT -- PRESENTERS FIRST TIME WE WERE TALKING BENEFITS IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PACKAGES -- AND THEN I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF JUST THE LAY OF THE LAND OF PENSION SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA. OTHER A LOT OF DIFFERENT PENSION SYSEMS AND THEIR SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES AND I'M GONNA GIVE A VERY VERY HIGH LEVEL -- DISCUSSION ABOUT THE INCLUDING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ROLE OF A CAP OF A PENSION BOARD VERSES THE EMPLOYER IN THE SYSTEMS. AND THEN LASTLY I'M TO BE TALKING ABOUT -- FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE THE COSTS FOR PROVIDING CALPERS PENSIONS -- AND KIND OF WHY THE COST ME GOING UP SO MUCH OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO. ALL THAT IN FIVE MINUTES I LOVE I'M GONNA TRY -- SO IN TERMS OF THE ROLE THE RETIREMENT -- BENEFIT IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE DIFFERENT TYPES EMPLOYEES TIMES OF EMPLOYERS. THE MIX OF BENEFITS REALLY VARIES BUT A COMMON. CAUSE STRUCTURE OF CROSS PUBLIC EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION IS THAT YOU HAVE A SALARY HEALTH BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND A KEY DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE BENEFITS IS THAT SALARY AND HEALTH BENEFITS EARNED TODAY. AND ALSO RECEIVED TODAY FOR AS THE RETIREMENT BENEFIT IS EARNED TODAY DURING THE COURSE OF THE EMPLOYEES CAREER. UP IT'S NOT RECEIVED UNTIL SOME FUTURE DATE AFTER THEY RETIRE -- AND WITHIN THE BUCKET OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS PENSIONS ARE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MOSTLY TODAY. BUT THERE ARE ALSO RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS. THAT -- MANY -- PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE RECEIVE -- AND ONE THING I WANTED TO MENTION ON IN TERMS OF PENN. IT HAS A DIFFERENT -- ALTHOUGH IT'S IMPORTANT BENEFITS FOR ALL EMPLOYEES IT HAS THAT KIND MORE IMPORTANCE FOR UP CERTAIN GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES AND IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. NAMELY TEACHERS AND POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SOCIAL SECURITY -- WHERE AS MANY MISCELLANEOUS PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ARE TO PARTICIPATE IN SOCIAL SECURITY ANNA PENSION BENEFITS WHEN THEY RETIRE THEY HAVE? TO GUARANTEED INCOME STREAMS AND RETIREMENT -- TEACHERS IN PEACE OFFICERS -- REALLY RELY ON THE PENSION AS THEIR PRIMARY INCOME SOURCE IN RETIREMENT. AND THE OTHER THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE ROLE OF PUBLIC -- OF RETIREMENT AND COMPENSATION IS JUST PEPPER IT'S THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES PENSION REFORM ACT OF TWENTY THIRTEEN AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW JUST BECAUSE IT. IT REDUCED BENEFITS GOING FORWARD FOR FUTURE EMPLOYEES AND ALSO CREATED A STANDARD WHERE BY EMPLOYEES WILL CONTRIBUTE HALF OF WHAT'S CALLED THE NORMAL COST -- AND THE NORMAL COST IS ESSENTIALLY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE ACTUARIES DETERMINE MUST BE SET ASIDE EACH YEAR TO PRE FUND THE BENEFIT OVER THE COURSE OF THE EMPLOYEES CAREER SO THAT. THE MONEY IS AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THEIR CAREER FOR IN RETIREMENT -- TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S AN UNFUNDED LIABILITIES TURNS FOR LESS THAN ACTUAR IS ASSUMED WHEN THEY DEVELOP THE NORMAL COST -- THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES RESPONSIBILITY OF THE EMPLOYER AND THAT WOULD BE WHY. THE THERE'S A LITTLE DISPARITY IN BETWEEN -- IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT THAT EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTE VERSES THE SIZE OF THE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS BECAUSE EMPLOYERS ALSO. PAYING DOWN THE ON FROM LIABILITY IF THERE IS. ONE THAT'S UP TURNING TO THE LAY OF THE LAND OF THE PENSION SYSTEMS -- EACH PENSION SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT AND THAT THEY OFFER DIFFERENT BENEFITS THEY SERVE DIFFERENT LAWYERS THEY SERVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EMPLOYEES -- BUT THERE ARE SOME COMMON THINGS ACROSS ALL THE SYSTEMS ONE IS THAT THEY'RE ADMINISTERED BY PENSION BOARD. AND THE PENSION BOARD HAS PLENARY AUTHORITY AS WELL AS FOR TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE MEMBERS OF THE SYSTEM -- TO ENSURE THAT THIS BENEFIT EXISTS ONCE THEY THEY DO RETIRE AND AND SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND THE BOARD IS REALLY THAT THE EMPLOYER. AND THE ALSO THE EMPLOYEE TO THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS PUTS THE MONEY INTO THE PENSION TRUST AND IT'S UP TO THE BOARD TO THEN DETERMINE HOW TO INVEST THE FUNDS -- WHAT ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE WHAT CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NECESSARY AND REALLY TO IT JUST ADMINISTER THE BENEFIT GOING FOR BUT THE PENSION? SYSTEM ITSELF DOES NOT PAY FOR THE HE'S CONTRIBUTIONS. AND SO THERE'S REALLY TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PENSION SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A STATE WIDE SYSTEMS AND THERE'S THE LOCALLY ADMINISTERED SYSTEMS. FROZE FOR THE STATEWIDE SYSTEMS THERE'S CALPERS AND CAL STIRS -- AND ALSO YOU SEE OUR P. WHICH IS OUR P. IS AVAILABLE TO UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PLEASE AND IS ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS. ALSO FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR TALK MOSTLY ABOUT CALPERS AND CAL STIRS BECAUSE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE MOST OF THE WORK DIRECT AUTHORITY OVER -- CALPERS IS -- PROVIDES BENEFITS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS TO STATE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO CHOOSE TO CONTRACT WITH CALPERS TO PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS -- IN ADDITION CALPERS ALSO ADMINISTERS PENSION BENEFITS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES WERE NOT TEACHERS SO CAFETERIA WORKERS CUSTODIAL STAFF THOSE TYPES OF CLASSIFICATIONS -- IN ADDITION TO THE PENSION BENEFITS CALPERS ALSO ADMINISTERS HEALTH BENEFITS FOR STATE EMPLOYEES AND STATE RETIREES. AND ALSO FOR ANY EMPLOYEES RETIREES OF PARTICIPATING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND SO UNDER FOR CAL STIRS THEY PROVIDE PENSION BENEFIT A MINISTER THE PENSION BENEFITS FOR TEACHERS -- AND THE ONE THING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ABOUT CAL STIRS THE TWENTY FOURTEEN FUNDING PLAN. WHERE THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED A FUNDING PLAN WERE BY? TEACHERS AS WELL AS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE STATE ALL BE CONTRIBUTE MORE MONEY INTO THE CAL STIR SYSTEM. SO THAT -- THE PENSION SYSTEM WILL BE FULLY FUNDED BY TWENTY FORTY SIX THAT'S THE TARGET DATE. FIVE WHICH WILL BE FULLY FUNDED. OKAY THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER POCKET OF OF SYSTEMS THAT ARE LOCALLY ADMINISTERED AND AS THE CHAIR INDICATORS THE NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN ACCIDENTS WHICH THOSE ARE THERE'S TWENTY SYSTEMS THERE AND RUN BY COUNTIES UNDER THAT LAW. AND IT'S THE COUNTY EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT LAW OF NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN BUT WE REFER TO THEM AS THE THREE SAT SEVEN X. SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION OF THE COUNTY SAN LUIS OBISPO ALL ITS OWN INDEPENDENT SYSTEM BUT THAT'S ESTABLISHED UNDER ANOTHER SECTION OF LAW. CHARTER CITIES ALSO ADMINISTER OR CANISTER THEIR OWN SYSTEM SO FRESNO SAN DIEGO A LOS ANGELES ALL MINISTER THEIR OWN -- SYSTEM OTHER THAN THAT THE COUNTIES AND CITIES AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A SPECIAL DISTRICTS CAN CHOOSE CONTRACT WITH EITHER THE COUNTY SYSTEMS OR WITH. CALPERS TO ADMINISTER THE BENEFITS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. OKAY SO NOW LOOKING AT THE STATE'S KIND OF PERSPECTIVE OF OF PAYING FOR THIS BENEFIT -- THAT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS OR SO THE COSTS OF REALLY. GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALL EMPLOYERS HAVE EXPERIENCED -- AND JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THIS -- IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO IN THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR THE STATE'S -- CONTRIBUTION AS A PERCENTAGE OF PAY RANGES BETWEEN 19% AND 54% A CALPERS -- AND THE STATE'S FIVE PENSION PLANS IN CALPERS AND A CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT VARIES DEPENDING ON THE GENEROSITY THE BENEFIT WHICH IS DETERMINED BY. THE EMPLOYEE TYPES OR THE PEACE OFFICERS WAS IS THEIR ONLY FORM OF INCOME IN RETIREMENT ETCETERA AND TO THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN RATES AND EIGHT OR NINE OTHER RATES RANGE FROM 16% 232% OF THE COUNTRY'S RATES OF REALLY GONE UP QUITE A BIT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE THE MISCELLANEOUS PLAN WHICH IS THE STATE'S LARGEST PLAN WAS -- BY SIXTEEN POINT 6% IN -- EIGHT OR NINE AND IT'S NOW 29% OF PAY SO IT'S GONE QUITE A BIT AND THE MEAT THERE REALLY TO DRIVING FACTORS BEHIND THIS ONE ARE ARE THE INVESTMENT LOSSES MOST NOTABLY BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RECESSION -- I MEAN I'VE I PULLED AWAY -- TO NINE NUMBERS FOR REASON IS KINDA ILLUSTRATING JUST BEFORE WE HAD THE LARGE INVESTMENT LOSSES -- AND THEN ALSO THERE SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION HAVE ALSO BEEN SOME PERIODS WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN LOWER THAN ASSUME INVESTMENT RETURNS AND SO THOSE OF ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO IT. BUT ALSO NOTABLE IS THAT THE CALPERS BOARD IS ADOPTED NEW ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. ARE THAT REALLY ARE INTENDED TO PUT THE SYSTEM ON A BETTER FOOTING FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE BENEFIT GOING FORWARD AND THESE THESE ACT WORLD SECTIONS OF INCLUDED. ASSUMING THAT -- MEMBERS LIVE LONGER BECAUSE THEY REAL ASSUMING AND ALSO MOST IMPORTANTLY IS THE LOWERING OF THE DISCOUNT RATES IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE ASSUMING THAT. FOR LESS MONEY WILL BE COMING IN FOR THEIR INVESTMENT GAINS IN THE FUTURE WHICH MEANS MORE MONEY HAS TO COME IN. THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS -- AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE PREPARED IF I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE AND VERY NICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SURE QUESTIONS. WELCOME YES HOMELESSNESS AND MY NUMBER DOWN THANK YOU I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS IN A MAYBE YOU ARE THE INDIVIDUAL HANSON MAYBE YOU'RE NOT -- WITH REGARD TO A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION -- THAT'S TYPICALLY ON A FOUR THIRTY SEVEN RIGHT MEGACITIES OPTED OUT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. TO INTO IT OPTED OUT OF OF PURSE OR WHATEVER MAYBE YOU EVEN MODIFIED THEIR OWN SYSTEM X. INDIA IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. WHAT WOULD THAT CITY IF THEY DO NOT HAVE AN UNDEFINED ATTENTION WHICH AND THEY HAD A DEFINED PENSION WITH THEY HAVE? TO PAY SOCIAL SECURITY. I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT I THINK WOULD HAVE TO TALK WITH A TAX ATTORNEY HOME. ANOTHER BECAUSE I I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS IT A FINE PLAN A PENSION. RIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN OPT OUT OF SOCIAL SECURITY HER PUBLIC AGENCY OR COULD HAVE AT SOME POINT I BELIEVE. IF IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A PUBLIC PENSION RIGHT. I'M DEEMED YOU KNOW THE ANSWER THAT I DON'T KNOW THE OKAY THAT'S OUR THAT'S UNDERSTOOD -- AND WITH REGARD UP TO PERSON STIRS WHAT IS I GUESS WHO IS AT THE DISCOUNT RATE THE RATE OF RETURN WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT FOR OUR THE SYSTEM SIMILAR. WE HAD A NUMBER OF BOTH GOING DOWN 27% AND THAT'S ABOUT GOING AND THEY REALLY SHOULD BE A WHAT LOT OF A LOT OF DE THAT DECLARES Là CONVERSATION ABOUT WHT THE RATE SHOULD BE IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR HISTORICAL RETURNS FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS FOR CALPERS. THE RETURNS OF ACTUALLY BEEN OVER 8% ON BUT THE FUTURE DOESN'T NECESSARILY LIKE THE PAST. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION AS FAR AS WHAT THAT ASSUMPTION SHOULD BE GOING FORWARD WITH THE MORE CONSERVATIVE FOUR OR MORE OR MORE. RISKY SO THAT THAT THE TO INDIVIDUAL BOARDS ACTUALLY SET THE DISCOUNT RATE AT LEAST OFF MAYBE A STAFF RECOMMENDATION. YES THEY MIGHT ACTUARIES FOR THE FOR THE SYSTEMS MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARDS AND ON THE BOARDS ADOPT WHAT THE POLICIES ARE. I HAVE THAT HAS THE BOARD ALWAYS ADOPTED WHAT THE ACTUARIAL RECOMMEND HE WITH REGARD THE ARE ARE. ARE YOU BOTH OF THE SYSTEMS HAVE A GUARANTEED COLIN BUILT INTO THEM -- FOR KERR'S THERE IS A GUARANTEED COLA UP TO A CERTAIN POINT -- BUT IT'S ALSO GUARANTEED -- LEVEL OF PURCHASING POWER -- FIRSTERS IT'S A IT'S A SIMPLE COLA SO IT'S BASED ON YOUR INITIAL PENSION AMOUNT AND NOT A COMPOUNDED COLA FOR CALPERS AT THE COMPOUND. IN. DO THE THOSE CALLS OBVIOUSLY IMPACT THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE PHONE AS WELL CORRECT THEY THE ACTUARIES INCORPORATE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO THE COLA IN THEIR CALCULATIONS FOR THE VALUATIONS. THANK YOU FOR WHAT WHAT QUESTION WHERE WOULD I GO TO GET MY QUESTION ANSWERED WITH REGARD TO THE THE DIVIDE LIKE HAVE YOU HAVE FOUR THREE SEVEN PLANNED YOU -- MUSTER MUST NOT. CALPERS MIGHT BILL ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR YOU I'M NOT SURE -- NAY ON THAT WITHIN MAYBE LET'S COUNSEL FOR THEIR HERE TODAY SORRY THEY'RE THEY'RE HERE TODAY I WON THE I'LL BE QUITE THE NO NO NO YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER QUESTIONS. HEARING ON THANK YOU MISTER APPRECIATED VERY MUCH. WILL MOVE TO PANEL THREE DAVID LATERAL. THIS IS A REPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA ACTUARY ACTUARIAL ADVISORY PANEL. MR LAMBRO WELCOME GOOD MORNING AND YOU SHOULD ALL RECEIVE A PIECE OF PAPER. SO MY NAME IS DAVID LUMBER -- DEPUTY SYSTEM ACTRA CALLOUS TO RIVERS BUT TODAY I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ACT PROVIDES RE PANEL. THAT THEY'LL REFER US TO CAP AS I GO THROUGH MY PRESENTATION. SO THE CAP WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IT CONSISTS OF EIGHT FACTORIES ALL OF US ARE PUBLIC SECTOR ACTUALLY SO WE WORK MOSTLY ON PUBLIC SECTOR. PENSION PLANS AND OPEC PLANS WE ARE ALL APPOINTED BY A GOVERNING BODY. A DO YOU GOVERNOR APPOINTS TWO OF THE ACT TREES CAL STAR IS A POINTS ONE MYSELF CALPERS APPOINTS ONE THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UC SYSTEM APPOINTS ONE THE ASSOCIATION OF THE COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEM APPOINTS. ONE THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY POINTS ONE AND THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON RULES APPOINTS ONE SO EIGHT ACTUALLY IT'S A AND BASED ON WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS THE PANEL SHOP PROVIDE IMPARTIAL AND INDEPENDENT INFORMATION ON PENSIONS ARE PENSION EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. AND BEST PRACTICES TO PUBLIC AGENCIES SO THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE DO WE MEET ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT TIMES A YEAR -- BUT THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY AT BERMAN CODE SECTION. TWO OH TWO TWO NINE UNDER THAT SECTION. CALPERS IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE IN THE REPORT ONCE. INFORMATION ON WHERE WOULD FUNDING LEVEL WAS BE FOR CALPERS. AND CONTRIBUTION RATES. IF IT'S WHERE TO ASSUME. SO. MISTER SHORTER BEFORE TALKED ABOUT THE INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTION IF CALPERS WERE TO ASSUME AND INVESTMENT KERN ASSUMPTION THAT IS EITHER. 2% LOWER OR 2% HIGHER THAN IT ASSUMES AND IT ALSO ASKED THAT CALPERS DISCLOSES WHAT CUT WHERE WHAT WOULD BE THE CONTRIBUTION RATE WHERE WITH THE RATES B. E.. IF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY WAS AMORTIZED OVER A GENERALLY A SHORTER PERIOD BASED ON THE HALL ALONE STATE EMPLOYEES ARE EXPECTED TO WORK SO THIS IS ONLY FOR THE STATE PLANS SO THIS IS WHAT GOVERNMENT SECTION TWO OH TWO TONIGHT SAYS. CALPERS YOU SHOULD PUBLISH THAT ONCE A YEAR. AND CALPERS HAS DONE SO EVERY YEAR IN THE FULFILL THAT REQUIREMENT EARLIER LAST FALL WHEN THE PUBLISHED WHAT IS CALLED THE THE JUNE THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN ACTUAL VALUATION FOR THE STATE PLANS. IF YOU ARE EVER INTERESTED TO LOOK AT IT TELL YOU DOCUMENT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FIRST PAGE I PROVIDED A LINK HERE. KINDA WHERE YOU CAN GET A COPY OF THE INFORMATION AND THE INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO SECTION TWO OH TWO TWO NINE BEGINS ON PAGE FORTY OF THAT REPORT. SO IF ALSO IN GOVERNMENT CO TWO OH TWO TWO NINE IT REQUIRES SOMEONE FROM THE CAP TO COME SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THREE SPECIFIC TOPICS. FIRST EXPLAIN THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTION AND THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD. IN THE CALCULATION OF CONTRIBUTION RATES. TO DESCRIBE THE CONSEQUENCES ON FUTURE STATE BUDGET IF THE INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTION IS NOT MET. AND ALSO TO IDENTIFY TO YOU WHETHER OR NOT DE CURRENT AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR CALPERS EXCEEDS WHAT IS REFERRED IN TWO OH TWO TWO NINE AS THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE. FOR A CALIFORNIA. STATE EMPLOYEES SO THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR TODAY. AND ALL OF AFTER I'M DONE I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION AND I MAY BE ABLE TO ANSWER YOUR CALL. MISTER O'DONNELL YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE SOCIAL SECURITY I CAN STILL LITTLE SOMETHING AFTER THIS. SO WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING PENSION. AS ACTUARIES WE HAVE TO SET SEVERAL WE HAVE. TO TO SET ACTUAL ASSUMPTIONS AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THEM THERE ARE SOME DEMOGRAPHIC ASSUMPTIONS ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT PENSION PLANS IN GENERAL ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC SIDE PROBABLY TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS ARE WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE EMPLOYEES TO RETIRE AND THE WHOLE LONG ARE THEY GOING TO LIVE. IS THAT BASICALLY DICTATES HOW MANY YEARS OF BENEFITS. AND ON THE ECONOMIC SIDE THE INVESTMENT. RETURN ASSUMPTION IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT. SEC CALPERS ED. CALPERS MADE A DECISION AT THE ABOVE FOR RECALL TWO YEARS AGO TWO THREE YEARS AGO TO GO FROM SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT THAT WAS THE OLD THE ACTUAL ASSUMPTION. TO GO DOWN TO SEVEN OVER MULTI -- OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD SAID THERE ABOUT THE DAY OF THEIR ASSUMING THAT THEIR LONG TERM RETURN WILL BE 7% THAT THIS IS KEY BECAUSE IF OVER THE NEXT FIVE TEN YEARS. THE INVESTMENT RETURN IS BELOW SEVEN IT'S GONNA START PUSHING PRESSURE IT'S GOING TO PUT PRESSURE ON CONTRIBUTION RATES AND IT'S LIKELY THAT THE THAT THE CALPERS BOARD WILL HAVE TO INCREASE CONTRIBUTION RIGHT. BECAUSE IT TO ITS COULD PROBABLY GONNA PUSH THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY TO A HIGHER LEVEL. ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE INVESTMENT RETURN IS HIGHER THAN. SEVEN YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE THE OPPOSITE THERE SAY IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO PUSH CONTRIBUTION RATES DOWN TO THE INVESTMENT RETURN ESTAMOS. CRITICAL AND WHERE CONTRIBUTION RATES ARE GOING TO GO IN THE FUTURE IF CALPERS CAN EARN MORE THAN. SEVEN THEN THE CONTRIBUTION RATES UP RECORDED EARLIER APPLE GOING TO GO DOWN AND VICE VERSA. AND THE ADVERTISE ASIAN PERIOD IS ALSO -- PAYS PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE BECAUSE THERE IS AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO TO PAY FOR TO KALISTO REFER TO CALPERS STATE PLANS THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY IS ESTIMATED TO BE JUST BELOW SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS. AND IS BEING PAID FOR RIGHT NOW OVER. DIFFERENT PERIODS FOR THE DIFFERENT STATE PLANS BUT ANYWHERE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO YEARS IS THE FUNDING THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD THAT CALPERS IS USING FOR THE STATE PLANS -- ASPER GOVERNMENT CUT ASK OF TO COMPARE -- IS CALPERS AMORTIZING UNFUNDED LIABILITY OVER A PERIOD THAT EXCEEDS WHAT IS CALLED THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE A PERIOD. SO I PROVIDED YOU IF YOU GO TO THE BACK OF THE PAGE A PROVIDED YOU. THERE'S A TABLE AT THE BOTTOM THAT SHOWS A CONTRIBUTION RATE WITH THE CURRENT FUNDING PERIOD IS FOR CALPERS. AND IT ALSO SHOWS THAT IF CALPERS WERE TO INSTEAD I'M MORE TIES UNFUNDED LIABILITY OVER. A MUCH SHORTER PERIOD ABOUT RANGING BETWEEN -- ELEVEN TO THIRTEEN THEN CONTRIBUTION RATES WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE IF YOU'RE CURIOUS TO FIND OUT BY HOW MUCH ALL OF THIS IS INCLUDED IN THAT REPORTS OF THE LINK AT THE HAVE ON THE FIRST PAGE. BUT THE MAIN THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING A PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT RETURN TO SKI. IF THE IF THE SYSTEM DOES NOT MEET THE ASSUME RETURN -- AND IT'S THE RETURN TO LOWER CONTRIBUTIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO UP. AND SAME THING AT THE AMORTIZATION BEARD PLAYS A KEY ROLE BECAUSE THE LONGER YOU PAY FOR IT. AS THE LORD A CONTRIBUTION RATE IT'S LIKE GETTING A FIFTEEN VERSUS A THIRTY YEAR MORTGAGE -- THIS CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION. AND JUST TO START WITH YOUR QUESTION YOU HAD EARLIER MISTER O'DONNELL -- IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A A AND NOT BE IN SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE NOT ALL EMPLOYEES CAN BE. AS LONG AS THE FOUR ONE K. PLAN OF THE FOUR FIFTY SEVEN IF IT'S A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION IT HAS TO MEET THE IRIS MINIMUM CONTRIBUTION. SO YOU COULD NOT JUST OFFER FOR EXAMPLE A FOUR ONE K. THAT PUTS WOULD NOT BE HIGH ENOUGH THE IRIS HAS RULES AS TO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE SOCIAL SECURITY. YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST PROVIDE A MINIMUM BENEFIT AT THE IRIS HAS RULES AS I DON'T HAVE THEM IN FRONT OF ME BUT IT IS POSSIBLE AS LONG AS YOU MEET THE MINIMUM RULES SET BY THE IRS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS FOR ANYONE. UP I I HAVE WHEN YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHETHER OR FUNDS ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCURATE OR CORRECT OR REASONABLE. AND HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK IN THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD. GOES IN THE DETERMINATION OF THAT I KNOW WITH STIRS WE SET A CERTAIN DATE. ARBITRARILY I THINK A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO -- IN WHICH THE THE BASIS OF THAT SO OF ALLEN AT THE GALA APPROACH YOUR QUESTION TWO DIFFERENT WAYS WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTUAL ASSUMPTION FOR EXAMPLE THE INVESTMENT RETURN. ALONG MEMBERS ARE EXPECTED TO LIVE. MOST RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA PERFORM WHAT'S CALLED AN EXPERIENCED ADD YOUR REVIEW OF THE ASSUMPTIONS EVERY FOUR YEARS MORE WERE YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUALEXPERIENCE OF THE PLAN ALONG A MEMBERS LIVING -- SALARY INCREASES EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN THINK ABOUT. THAT COULD AFFECT THE MEMBERS BENEFIT SO DOES A THE BOARD AND THOSE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ADOPTED. SO BASICALLY THE WAY YOU MAKE SURE THEY'RE APPROPRIATE IS BY ENSURING THAT WHAT YOU ASSUME IS IN LINE WITH YOUR ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF YOUR PLAN. TO ANSWER YOUR OTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE FUNDING PERIOD THIS IS MORE OF A I'M NOT SURE THERE WAS SOMETHING. TAKE AN EXACT ANSWER HERE WHEN YOU TRY TO FUND A PENSION PLAN IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE SAME QUESTION YOU HAVE AS AN INDIVIDUAL YOU'RE ABOUT TO BY YOU FOR WAS HOUSE. YOU WALK INTO THE BANK. AND NOW YOU ASK YOURSELF SHOULD I GET A FIFTEEN YEAR MORTGAGE OR SHOULD I GET A THIRTY YEAR MORTGAGE. IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT. I THINK EVERYONE WOULD AGREE IT'S PROBABLY BETTER TO HAVE A FIFTEEN YEAR MORTGAGE YOU GOING TO PAY LESS INTEREST LONG TERM. BUT NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD IT THAT THE FUNDING A PENSION PLAN. IS THE SAME THING IT'S A BASICALLY IT'S A COMPROMISE BETWEEN HOW QUICKLY DO YOU WANT TO GET. TO A 100% FUNDED VERSUS ALL HIGH THE CONTRIBUTION RATES NEED TO BE AND HOW MUCH VOLATILITY ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE ON ON THE YEAR TO YEAR BASIS. SENATOR THERE IS AN EXACT ANSWER TO QUESTION IT'S MORE OF A I THINK IT'S WHAT MOST OF THE BORE. MOST OF THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM THE BOARD MEMBERS WILL GO TO THIS DISCUSSION WITH IRAQ TREES AS TO WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE -- FUNDING PERIOD AND BOARD MADE THE DECISION GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE TO GO FROM THIRTY YEARS TO A TWENTY YEAR AMORTIZATION. A FAUCET CAL STIRS -- DE FUNDING PERIOD AS WAS QUOTED EARLIER IS SET IN STATUTE WE'RE TRYING TO FIND AND ELIMINATE THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY SIX BUT FOR MOST OF THE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA. THE BOARD WILL GO THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION AND DECIDE WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE FUNDING PERIOD. PERIOD THANK YOU MISTER ALAA YES SEVEN OVER DOT. HOW HAS LIFE EXPECTANCY AND YOU MAY NOT YOU I'M YOU MAY NOTICE HOW THE TOP YOUR HEAD YOU MAY NOT LET'S JUST TAKE MAYBE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS? HOW HAS LIFE EXPECTANCY CHANGED? IT HAS YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS YES I DO AN ENTER TO CREATE BUT HOW AMONG CREASE. FOR US AT CAL STAR IS WE'VE ADDED ALMOST FIVE TO SIX YEARS -- THE OTHER THING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT IS OF NOT EVERYONE IN THE UNITED STATES. LIVE A HAS THE SAME LIFE EXPECTANCY FEW LOOK ACROSS THE US IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT WE YEAH. WE ARE BLESSED IN CALIFORNIA BEING IN IN IN THE STATE WHERE LIFE EXPECTANCY TENDS TO BE LONGER THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA NOT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW SAID THERE WERE A COUPLE NEW STORIES RECENTLY ABOUT THE A STUDY RELEASED BY THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES. IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN WELL KNOWN TO US BUT FOR EXAMPLE TEACHERS HAVE ALWAYS LIVE MUCH LONGER THAN THE REST OF THE POPULATION. IF YOU LOOK AT US AT CAL STARS AND YOU COMPARE TO CALPERS CAL STAR WAS MEMBERS LIVE ON AVERAGE THREE YEARS LONGER THAN THE CALPERS MEMBER. AND A CALPERS MEMBER LIVE SOMETIME ON AVERAGE TWO THREE YEARS LONGER THAN YOUR TYPICAL SOCIAL SECURITY -- INDIVIDUAL TO SOMETIME AGO WHEN WE HAD A DISCUSSION CAL STARS OVER THE PROPER ASSUMPTIONS YOU HAVE. TO YOU KNOW WHEN THE SYSTEM PAYS THAT CALPERS AND CAL STIRS WILL BOTH PAYING IN THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OF BENEFIT TO YOU -- YOU CAN DO THE MATH QUICKLY WHEN YOU ADD ONE YEAR LIFE EXPECTANCY. IF THAT IT ADDS UP QUICKLY AND SO A A ARE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS. THAT YOU MIGHT REBOOT THAT NUMBER IN FUTURE YEARS ARE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS BUILT IN YOUR PROJECTIONS THEY ARE SO RIGHT NOW THEY ARE BUILT INTO IT. IT IS IT IS PROBABLY THE SECOND BIGGEST DRIVER BEHIND COST AFTER THE INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTION. IS THE WHAT WE CALL THE MORTALITY ASSUMPTION OF THE LIFE EXPECTANCY AT AND THEN WHAT IS A WHAT IS FULLY FUNDED OR 1100% FUNDED ME DOESN'T MEAN. FOR THE MEMBERS YOU HAVE NOW YOU WON'T HAVE TO PUT ANOTHER DOLLAR IN. AND THEY WERE AND YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL USE THE TERM SUPER FUNDED RIGHT. THERE WAS A CLAIM THAT THEY WERE SUPER FUN AND I THINK YOU'D NEVER HAVE TO PUT ANOTHER DOLLAR EVER. IN IN IN THE PERSON. CAN YOU CAN YOU WHAT WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES THERE YES SO FULLY FUNDED IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO PUT A DOLLAR IN. A SO FULLY FUNDED MEANS THAT YOU HAVE. YOU HAVE NO UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR THE SERVICE THAT'S LREADY BEEN ACCRUED BY THE MEMBERS MISTER SHORTER BEFORE TALKED ABOUT THE NORMAL COST. ON AN ONGOING BASIS THERE ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE A CONTRIBUTION TO PAY IF YOU WANT FOR THE SERVICE THAT THE MEMBERS ARE ORDERING AND THAT YOU. MAY KNOW THE REASON BUT WHY MOST RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA A COLLECTING CONTRIBUTIONS THAT EXCEED THE NORMAL COST IS BECAUSE MOST SYSTEMS HAVE AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY. SO THE SYSTEMS ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATED. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE A THEN THERE WOULD BE THEN THE CONTRIBUTION WOULD SIMPLY BE THE NORMAL COST. A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE TERM SUPER FUNDED STARTED TO FLOAT AROUND BECAUSE IF YOU GO BACK. TO NINETEEN NINETY NINE TWO THOUSAND OF MOST RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA WERE WERE ABOVE A 100% FUNDED. AND MANY SYSTEMS NOT ALL BUT MANY TOOK ALLOWED EMPLOYERS TO TAKE CONTRIBUTION HOLIDAYS. AT FOUR SEVEN CALLOUSED OR WERE TO WERE EMPLOYERS AT THAT HAVE A CONTRIBUTION HOLIDAY BUT MANY DID. AND THOSE SYSTEM THOSE PLANS WERE OFTEN REFERRED AS SUPER FUNDED SO YOU WERE YOU WERE ALLOWED TO TAKE SOME KIND OF CONTRIBUTION HOLIDAY. WHICH NOW. WITH GOV REFORM PEPPER ON TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN DOES CONTRIBUTION HOLIDAYS WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED IN CALIFORNIA SO IF THERE'S EVER A TIME WHERE WE ARE ONCE AGAIN. WHICH YOU KNOW I HOPE WE DO -- WHERE WE ARE AND A SURPLUS POSITION FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE THEN OF CONTRIBUTION WOULD STILL HAVE TO FLOW INTO THE PENSION SYSTEM? AND WITH REGARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH IS THREE BILLION INTO STIRS RIGHT WAS IT ONLY STIRS. IT'LL BUT IT'S BASICALLY FOR YEAH SO FOR US IT'S A FORECASTERS IT WOULD BE. BASICALLY I THINK IN THE COMING BUDGET YEAR FOUR POINT ONE BILLION TWO CAL STIRS AN ADDICT THREE BILLION TO CALPERS AND IT'S REALLY ONLY A HOLIDAY FOR TWO YEARS OUT ITS NOT A HOLIDAY IT'S JUST TO PAY OFF THE ARE NOT A LOT OF LEADER IT'S IT'S SOME IT'S PART. OF A HOLIDAY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RAISING IT TO THE LEVEL THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE CORRECT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENCE OF FOR THE FOR THE THREE BILLION THAT'S COMING TO CALLAS STAR IS ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYER IS. WHAT THE WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS TO YOU WAS SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION TO PAY THE AMOUNT ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYER IS RIGHT? AND THE OTHER TWO POINT THREE BILLION TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO IT'S A IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH. THANK YOU THANK YOU DR BEN. I THANK YOU. IT YOUR PRESENTATION WHEN THINGS -- AS I HEAR YOUR ANSWER -- TO SUMMER MCDONALD'S QUESTION IS -- IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC THIS WHOLE -- TERM OF FUNDED UNDER FUNDED OVER FUNDED SUPER FUNDED OR WHATEVER. BECAUSE I THINK UNFORTUNATELY AS WE HEAR TRY TO MAKE PUBLIC POLICY AND MAKE THE RULES LIKE PEPPER OTHER TYPES RULE. THE THE HELP GOVERN -- BOTH -- STIRS IN PERSON. THAT I THINK PUBLIC MISPERCEPTIONS ARE AN ABILITY TO CLEARLY COMMUNICATE WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN SOMEONE SAYS YOU'RE FULLY FUNDED OR YOU'RE UNDER FUNDED OR YOUR SUPER FUNDED -- CAN LEAD TO BAD POLICY MAKING BECAUSE I THINK WITHOUT A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS. WE START MAKING BAD POLICY DECISIONS WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THE PENSION HOLIDAYS ARE MADE RIGHT WHAT WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN WHEN YOU'RE FULLY FUNDED OR SUPER FUNDED RIGHT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN SO. I GUESS I WOULD URGE AND I KNOW THAT -- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- THE OTHER SYSTEMS COME UP MORE SPECIFICALLY ON THE ACTARIAL SIDE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE COMMUNICATE THESE THINGS RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT WERE UNDER FUNDED RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY ABOUT THAT WATER UNFUNDED LIABILITY IS AND I THINK THERE'S SOME. MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT THAT AND THEN ALSO IF. I HOPE WE GET TO A SITUATION WHERE WE CAN SAY WERE FULLY FUNDED BUT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT -- WELL ALL THE MONEY'S THERE WE CAN JUST WALK AWAY AND OR YOU DON'T NOW WE CAN GIVES MORE STUFF AWAY RIGHT -- AND WE KNOW THE MARKETS GO UP AND DOWN OVER FUNDED IS WHEN THE MARKET'S UP IN WHEN THE MARKET FALLS THAT UNDER FUNDED THAT. FULLY FUND THEIR SUPER FUND IT'S ONLY BECOMES UNDERFUNDED GREAT. ARE UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO I GUESS THAT WOULD BE MY PLEA TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE BETTER ACTUALLY MESSAGE THESE THESE THINGS -- AND HOW WE CAN HELP I COMMUNICATE THAT AS WELL SO WE CAN COMMUNICATE OR CONSTITUENTS. IF YOU COULD BE A BRIEF ANSWER AT APPRECIATE IT WERE WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE. ALRIGHT THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THANK PREVIOUS AREAS I JUST NEED A CLARIFICATION ON ONE THING I'LL BE GUESTS. WITH REGARD TO THE CONTRIBUTION RATE I'M LOOKING AT A CHART HERE I'M NOT SURE IF THIS WAS FROM YOU. BUT TO TALK ABOUT THE VARIOUS CONTRIBUTION RATES IS THAT EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE COMBINE. THESE ARE ONLY THE IT'S ONLY THE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION WITHOUT FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR ONLY THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SLAMMER -- FOR PROCEDURE PRESENTATION WHEN I MOVED. TO ITEM NUMBER -- FIVE FOR WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM MARTY FROST AND BEEN BANG GOOD MORNING [inaudible] MY BEEN. LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION WILL THANK YOU OKAY MORNING SENATOR HELL AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARCY FROST ON THE CEO IT CALPERS. SO I WILL USE MY FIVE MINUTES AS WISELY AS I CAN AND TRY TO BE ADDITIVE TO THE TWO FORMER SPEAKERS WHO WERE BEFORE YOU. SO WE'RE HAPPY TO BE HERE AGAIN TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVE ABOUT CALPERS AND BENDING ALL HAVE HIM INTRODUCED HIMSELF BUT WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE BEEN JOIN. REJOIN THE TEAM AFTER BEING WITH CALPERS FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS HE IS SAD BACK WITH US AND HAS BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT SIX WEEKS. I'M A COUPLE OF THINGS FOR US SO I MEAN IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE LAST TWO YEARS AND SOME OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT DECISIONS HAD BEEN MADE IN THE SYSTEM. AND THEN I'M GOING TO ASK BEEN TO REALLY TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE NEXT TWO TO FIVE YEARS AND WHAT CALPERS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON AND THINKING ABOUT. I THINK YOU ALL HAVE THIS HAND OUT BEFORE YOU IF NOT -- WE CAN GET THIS TO YOU -- BUT SOME PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE HERE HOPE WE CAN GET THIS TO YOU BUT I'M CALPERS REALLY IS ABOUT PEOPLE AND WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE THE WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE FINANCIAL SECURITY -- AFTER THEY STOP WORKING. WE SERVE ABOUT ONE POINT NINE MILLION MEMBERS ON THE PENSION SIDE. AND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION MEMBERS ON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE SO WE ARE ALSO THE SECOND LARGEST PURCHASER OF HEALTH CARE BESIDES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ADDITION TO RUNNING. THE BIGGEST U. S. PUBLIC PENSION PLAN. WE PAY OUT ABOUT TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND PENSION BENEFITS SEND MOST OF THOSE BENEFITS ARE BEING SPENT IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES THE NUMBER CONTRIBUTIONS THAT TWO THIRDS OF THAT BENEFIT IS ACTUALLY BEING PAID OUT OF THE INVESTMENT RETURNS WHICH IS WHY THIS ROLE SITTING NEXT ME THIS PERSON SITTING NEXT TO ME IS REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SYSTEM. AND THE OVERALL HEALTH. NOT MAJOR DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THAT SYSTEM SET AT ABOUT 68% FUNDED ARE MEETING WITH 68% OF THE ASSETS NEEDED TO PAY FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE LIABILITIES. AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A SYSTEM SET AT 71%. AND THERE ARE SOME DECISIONS THAT HAD TO BE MADE AGAIN. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM WAS IN A SUSTAINABLE -- PLACE THINK EVERYONE HAS THEIR COPIES DOWN. AND THE FIRST DECISION THAT WAS MADE AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE LOWERING OFTHE DISCOUNT RATE. SO WE LOWERED IT FROM SEVEN POINT FIVE THE STEPS AND WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM OUR THREE THOUSAND PUBLIC EMPLOYERS THAT THEY NEEDED TO PLAN FOR THOSE REDUCTIONS THROUGH A MORE METHODICAL WAY I EAT DON'T PUSH THAT OUT IN A WHEN YEAR REDUCTION AND GIVE US A LITTLE. BIT OF TIME TO PLAN FOR THAT IN OUR BUDGETS SO WE DID THAT THE STATE TOOK IT IN THE FIRST YEAR SCHOOLS AND LOCAL STICK IT IN THE SECOND YEAR. AND WE ARE MOVING THROUGH ALL OF OUR VALUATION REPORTS AND LOWERING THAT AGAIN THAT DISCOUNT RATE DOWN TO SEVEN OF WHICH THE STATE IS AT SEVEN I'LL ASPIN TO TALK ABOUT THE ASSET ALLOCATION. BUT WE ALSO SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SHORTER AMORTIZATION WHERE WE TOOK THE THIRTY YEAR AMORTIZATION AND WE LOWERED IT TO TWENTY YEAR. AND THE TWENTY YEARS ONLY FOR FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES AT THE THIRTY YEAR REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL FORMER -- GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE U. L.. AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE DID THAT TWICE WE SOUGHT NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION AND IN THE FUND AND THAT IS NOT A GOOD FINANCIAL POSITION -- FINANCIAL POLICY FOR THE ORGANIZATION SO AGAIN WORKING THROUGH NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS THE EMPLOYERS REALLY WORKING THROUGH THE AFFECTS OF THAT KIND OF CHANGE ON BUDGETS. SO WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT IN PLACE. AND WE ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EXTRA CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HAVE COME INTO CALPERS SO GOVERNOR BROWN AND THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY SIX BILLION DOLLARS CAME INTO THE PLANET TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THAT HELPS TO PAY DOWN THAT UNFUNDED ACTUAL RELIABILITY. AND THEN THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO PAY CALPERS AND ADDITIONAL THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY DOWN AGAIN ANOTHER PAYMENT TO THE U. I. L.. AND THEN LAST BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO BàN AND THEN OBVIOUSLY BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE AS WE WE REALLY HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE TYPE OF TOWN I'M SO HIRING THEN BACK INTO THE ORGANIZATION AND THEN MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT WE HIRED. A NEW CFO NAY MICHAEL COHEN WHO I THINK MANY OF YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR BROWN'S FINANCE DIRECTOR. SO HE IS WITH US FIRMLY IN PLACE AND WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE THESE TWO NEW HIRES WITH US BUT APPLIES THEIR MAKE UP A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AGAIN AND BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AS I TURN IT OVER TO BEN. THANK YOU BETTER MORNING THINKING MORE SEE UGLY MONNING OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S YOU BUT NONE OF THE SHIPPING LANES AND US CHIEF YOU MUCH OFFICE OF A CALPERS. OF SOUL OF ANOTHER SPEND THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES WERE BRIEFLY GIVE YOU A INTRODUCTION FOR THE YOU MUST IN OFFICE AND THEN DISCUSS THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN THE U. MANAGEMENT OF THE APARTMENTS TODAY AND OPPORTUNITIES WHERE HIVE. AND IMPROVE FOR THE LA TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF A PRIVATE EQUITY PRIVATE ASSET CLASSES. TO HELP US TO ACHIEVE THE REQUIRED RATE OF RETURN. SO I DO SEE ON FLIGHT NIGHT OF THE U. MUCH I'M OFFICE -- ISRAEL ORGANIZED AROUND AT THE MAJOR ASSET CLASSES -- WE HAVE GLOBAL EQUITY -- BASE OF 50% OF THE I LOCATION FIXING COME 28%. AND THE PRIVATE EQUITY EIGHT PRESS TERMS OF THE THAILAND THE CAPITAL TO JANET WHICH RETURN THE TO DECIDE SEE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES FOR ONE YOU KNOW -- IN THE PAST -- TEN YEARS OF THE CAPITAL MARKET HAS DELIVERED -- PRETTY DECENT -- RETURNS BUT THE TAIL WIND AWARD -- FAVORABLE FACTORS THAT ATTRIBUTE INTO -- TO DECENT PERFORMANCE IN PASTA YEARS SUCH AS A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES AND THAT THE INCREASE IN PROFIT MARGINS ARE LESS LIKELY TO REPEAT. IN THE FUTURE. AND ALSO AT THE TOP VIOLATIONS OF OF ALL MAJOR ASSET CLASSES ALL HIGH WHICH MAY IMPLY LOWER RETURNS IN THE FUTURE. AND TO ALL OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC BY A BACKDROP SO WE EXPECT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY -- TO GROW AT A SLOWER PACE -- A UNIT FUTURE DUE TO ON FIELD -- TRANSIT SATELLITE A SUCH AS A DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND UP FOR FULL PRODUCTIVITY GAINS. AND ALSO THE ANOTHER TRYING TO THE FACES REALLY DO A FEW OPPORTUNITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES NOW IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. AS TO THE FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE BECOMING MALMO EFFICIENT WHICH LEAVING OF FEW OPEN THE LAST THAILAND'S LAST TIED INTO A FACE -- NOT LEAST IS ALL ON THIS THE ON THE PHONE TO THE STATUS ASSYRISKA LIMITS THE OPTIONS WE HAVE TO A CHIEF OFF THE RECORD RATE OF RETURN. SO THESE ARE THE CHALLENGES WE SEE IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS BUT THEY ALSO ARE A C. OPPORTUNITIES ALL AS WELL PARTLY. THE OF THE ACTIONS A YOU AND I GONNA TO BE IN THE RECENT PAST BY INJECTING ADDITIONAL CASH DOLLAR TO THE SYSTEM. AND ALSO THE ACTIONS THAT -- THE INVESTMENT BOARD YOU MUSTN'T COMEDIA CULPRITS TO SUCH AS LOWERING THE DISCOUNT RATE 27% A SHORTENED -- I'M A POSITION SCHEDULE FROM THIRTY YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS ALSO ALL THESE ACTIONS HELPED US TO IMPROVE OF A LIQUIDITY PROFILE. AND WAYS TO IMPROVE THAT HE COULD PROFILE. WE HAVE SOME LIABLE OPTIONS TO ACHIEVE THE 7%. OF RETURN. AND THAT THE REALLY APPLIES REALLY FOR THE FUTURE IS FOLLOW US TO FOCUS ON GENERATING 27% OF RETURN. DENTON OF FOCUSING ON DOING SO BY ALL FOCUSING ON ABA COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES AND ADOPT A LONG TERM FOCUS SO THAT'S WHERE WE SEE THAT UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES. THAT CAN AWAKEN REALLY TAKE A LONGER TO OFFER THAT YOU APPROVED OF THE CRITICALLY PROFILE PASSED A TEN YEARS AND TWENTY YEARS WITHIN OUGHT TO IN A LONG TERM ALL BUT DIDN'T ACHIEVE THE REQUIRED WITH. HER. AND AT THE LEAST TO MY THIS LAST SECTION FROM MY MY TALK HERE IS THE IMPORTANCE OF FOR PROBABLY MARKET. SO IT IF YOU LOOK AT CALPERS OUR HISTORY. WILL OUR OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS PRIVATE EQUITY IS A THE ONLY ASSET CLASS AT DELIVERED A RETURN THAT HIGHER THAN 7%. AS YOU CAN SEE THE ONSLAUGHT ON THE NEXT SLIDE. UP IN THE PAST TWENTY YEAR PERIOD PRIVATE EQUITY DELIVERED TO ATTEND A HALF PERCENT AND THE LAST YEAR A THEATER WITH US -- AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT GOING FORWARD PRIVATE EQUITY IS EYES ACOSTA DOUBLE GIVE US THE HIGHS CHONG'S. TO ACHIEVE THE 7%. AND SO THE AS DO SOME OF YOU KNOW THAT'S THE AWAY ARE EXPLORING BECAUSE WE NEED A PRIVATE EQUITY TO ACHIEVE THE REQUIRED ME -- TO RETURN AND ALSO PROVIDE THE STATE -- AND WE CAN DO SO -- TO SYLVIA MOST MARK IN THE MODE RISK PRUDENTLY IN A SMART WAY NEAR SMARTLY WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS REALLY. TO TAKE A LOT FIRST AND THEN THE FLY OUR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES AND THEN A TAKE A WANTED TO FIGURE OUT A YOU MUST MISS STRATEGY TO TAKE A LONGER TO OFF OUR A STRUCTURE. OF THE MONTH TO JUICE AND ONE OF THESE TO TO A TO DO SO IS REALLY. TO IMPART TO INCREASE OUR ALL ALLOCATION TO PRIVATE EQUITY -- AND WE WILL HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO TO ADDITIONAL BUSINESS MODELS IN ADDITION TO WHAT ABOUT DOING NOW WHICH IS THE CALPERS INNOVATION AND A CELL CALPERS PARTISAN FONT. SO THESE ARE THE NEW IDEAS WE ARE EXPLORING WAYS -- WITH THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE AT CALPERS -- I THINK WE CAN SKIP THE LAST SLIDE ON THE ALREADY IN CAVES AND ENGAGEMENT AND DIVERSE MEANT ALL POLICIES. AND TURN OF BACK TO MARCY FOR THE CLOSING REMARKS AND THEN WE'LL BE READY TO ALL FEEL QUESTIONS ALRIGHT SO JUSTIN KEY TAKE AWAYS ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANTED TO DO WITH YOU ALL THIS MORNING IS TO UNDERSTAND THE STRATEGIES THAT WE ARE WORKING ON TO IMPROVE THE FUNDED. STATUS 70% IS CERTAINLY A VITAL SIGN ARTS A VITAL SIGN IT'S COMMUNICATED OUT TO THE MEMBERS AND TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT HOW HEALTHY IS CALPERS. SO WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY WE HAVE IT IN OUR OWN INNER IN A RED INDICATOR FRANCIS 70% IS A RED INDICATOR TO GET INTO A YELLOW INDICATOR WERE THINKING EIGHTY PERCENTILE TO GET INTO A GREEN INDICATOR. THAT'S GOING TO BE A 95% FUNDED STATUS AND NAY STRATEGIES ARE LONG TERM THESE ARE TWENTY THIRTY YEARS STRATEGIES THIS IS NOT A FIX THAT WILL HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE 7% RETURN TARGET IS SOMETHING THAT OUR INVESTMENT OFFICE HAS TO FOCUS ON AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THEY WANT TO FOCUS IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE PRIVATE EQUITY OR PRIVATE MARKETS. AND LEVERAGING THOSE PRIVATE MARKETS TO HELP US ATTAIN THAT HIGH REWARD -- TARGET 7% HIGH REWARD YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME RISK AND YOU HAVE TO USE INNOVATION TO GET THERE BUT WE HAVE TO BE VERY PRUDENT ABOUT THE RISKS THAT WERE TAKING BECAUSE AGAIN NOT BEING FULLY FUNDED WE HAVE TO BE. CAREFULLY MONITORING THAT FUNDED STATUS SO WE ALSO I WANNA MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO YOU ALL AT ANY TIME AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT THAT YOU'VE HAD WITH US SO FAR. SO I THINK THAT DOES CONCLUDE OUR REMARKS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES OF COURSE. BEEN JUST QUICK QUESTION REGARDING HIS PROPOSED -- INVESTMENT MODELS ANY BEEN LOOKING OUT OF IS THERE ANY IDEA FRIEDMAN FORWARD WHEN THAT BE LIKE ANOTHER YEAR YOU THINK OR OR WHAT'S WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME ON THAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT DOING THAT. YEAH SO WE ARE. APPROACHING THESE. ICE PRUDENCE POSSIBLE AND MEANTIME DUTCH WAIT NO WE NEED X.. SOONER RATHER THAN LATER SOUL I HOPE WE WILL BE ANOTHER -- WILL BE ANOTHER YEAR SHOULDN'T BE ANOTHER YEAR. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN OVER JUST TO CUT CODE IF I MAY I JUST QUIT YOUR BEST LIGHT ON HERE IS NUMBER. SIXTEEN ENGAGEMENT VERSE DIVESTMENT I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER EDUCATE THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE THE INVESTMENT ADVISER TO THE CALIFORNIA PENSION FUNDS. YOUR THE PROFESSIONALS YOU SHOULD DO IT THANK YOU. I THINK WE CAN ALL SHARE IN THAT THOUGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE DOCTOR PAN I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON AS TO KEEP US ALIVE. WELL THANK YOU ACTUALLY I I WAS GOING TO POINT OUT THAT PROBABLY THAT WAS THE ONES LIKE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SKIPPED. WHEN JUST RECALLING MY LAST FOUR YEARS IS CHAIRING AT FIRST COMMITTEE -- PROBABLY TOOK MORE OF OUR TIME THAN THAN THAN ANY OTHER ASPECT -- SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT SO CERTAINLY WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE ENGAGEMENT -- I IT IS CERTAINLY SO I SEE TWO THINGS THE LAST. ONE EIGHT STEPS YOU TOOK. AND DRESSING SERVICE WAS THAT PROFILE LOOK LIKE GOING INTO THE FUTURE I MEAN WE HAVE WE TALKED ABOUT LONGEVITY IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL SO FORTH. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT LIQUIDITY OUR R. V. I MEAN APPRECIATE TAKE THE STEPS ARE WE IN A GOOD PLACE ON THAT I MEAN WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE STILL PAYING OUT MORE BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE TIES THAN PEOPLE CONTRIBUTING OF WHAT SO WHERE WHERE ARE WE IN TERMS. OF THAT PROFILE IN TERMS OF PEOPLE CONTRIBUTORS VERSUS -- HE'S RECEIVING BENEFITS OKAY THANK YOU CENTER PANTS YES WE ARE STILL IN THE POSITION AND NOT AND AND COMMON POSITION FOR A PLANNED AS MATURE AS CALPERS SERVER EIGHTY FIVE YEAR OLD PLANS. AND WE WE DO HAVE MORE RETIREES BEEN ACTIVES AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RATIO IS EXACTLY BUT WE CAN GET YOU THAT THAT DATA. BUT THAT ALL YOU KNOW THAT DEMOGRAPHIC GOES INTO HOW WE FUND THE PLAN SO THE NORMAL CLASS THAT DAVID SPOKE ABOUT VERSES THE INFINITE ACTUAR LIABILITY WERE FORECASTING -- THAT -- INTO THE NORMAL COST CONTRIBUTION RIGHT SO IT'S NOT UNEXPECTED. THAT'S JUST A PART OF BEING A MATURE PLANT WELL AND THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS AS WE FIGURE OUT WHAT EXPECTATIONS ARE GOING TO BE -- FOR FOR THE PLAN -- WHEN YOU HAVE? WELL IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY GOING OUT AND COMING AND THAT ALSO MEANS THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO HAVE A LARGER CASH POSITION YOU MAY HAVE TO BE WHEN ANYONE WHO'S BY THE MONEY MARKET. ARE DOES THAT THAT RETURN IS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU CAN GET THE STOCK MARKET. AND ALSO THAT MEANS THAT SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MORE CONSERVATIVE THERE SHOULD BE SURE OF THE CASH TO MEET YOUR OBLIGATIONS YOUR OBJECT CURRENT OBLIGATIONS NOT JUST IN THE FUTURE ONES AND SO -- AND SO JUST A I THINK ALSO THAT ALL BECAUSE GIVING THAT LIQUIDITY SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT -- I HAVE A CHUNK OF MONEY I CAN JUST TAKE IT ALL THE SB FIVE HUNDRED AND WHICH HAS A NINE POINT NINE THE AND ALL THREE YEAR RETURN IT'S ADDRESS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT BALANCE AND MAKES THE RIGHT OUT. YOU WON'T BE KEPT TRYING TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS. WHEN THE MARKET'S DOWN RIGHT BECAUSE THEN YOU REALLY HAVE TO TAKE THE LOSS YOU CAN'T IT'S NOT TO THE PAPER LOSSES REAL LOSS SO I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION THOSE AROUND THE PRIVATE EQUITY IN NICE CERTAINLY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT PRIVATE EQUITY? AT THE SAME TIME A I THINK THERE IS PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT SOME THESE PRIVATE EQUITY GROUPS BECAUSE SOME OF THEM CHARGE VERY LARGE FEES. SO FORTH SO -- AND AGAIN -- YEAH WE THINK ABOUT CALPERS IS A VERY BIG SYSTEM WORD PROBABLY COMPARED TO OTHER INVESTORS WERE NOT SO BIG GUY THERE CERTAINLY. NOW SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS OTHER TYPES OF THINGS OUT THERE AS WELL BUT TO WHAT DEGREE DO YOU THINK. WHAT STEPS CALPERS IS ABLE TO TAKE? ONE AS YOU ARE IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY MARKET TO TRY. TO NOT JUST MAXIMIZE RETURNS THAT'S ALWAYS THE GOAL ONE BUT ALSO SOMETIMES RETURNS ARE DEPEND ON WHAT FEES PEOPLE TAKE OUT AS WELL AND WILL OFTEN SEE ARTICLES CRITICIZING THE LEVEL FEES THAT ARE BEING CHARGED BY. THESE PRIVATE EQUITY FUND SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA WHERE THINGS CALPERS CAN DO. TO LOWER THE FEES WHICH ACTUALLY THAT INCREASES OUR RETURNS AS WELL AND AND STILL BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS. TELL US INDEPENDENCE BERKELEY QUESTIONS SO YOU GO TO SLIDE FIFTEEN TO NEW PROPOSALS THAT -- UNDER DISCUSSION UNDER CONSIDERATION CALPERS IN THE INNOVATION HARDER THAN FUND COUNSEL YOU OUGHT TO WRITE THAT YOU KNOW -- IT COULD GET THEIR TWO POINTS -- WE LOOK AT A PRIVATE PRIVATE EQUITY AND I SAT CLASS A. HAS DUE TO DELIVER THE BEST PERFORMANCE TO ASSUME THAT HE'S I COULD BE AS HIGH AS A CLASS THAT WE DO NOT LIKE. FOCUS ON THE HIGHER FEES BUT AGAIN THE PULLED UP ALL PERFORMANCE WHERE CODING IS NIGHT OF THE FEES EVEN AFTER ALL THE FEES EXPENSES TO THE BEST PERFORMING ASSET CLASS. BUT THERE ARE THINGS I DECIDED HIGHER FEES LACK OF TRANSPARENCY LACK OF CONTROL. AND THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE ARE PROPOSING AND CONSIDERING A SLIGHT FIFTEEN OFFSET FIFTEEN THE INNOVATION HARD ISN'T DOESN'T INNOVATION TO MARCY ALL WAS ALL REFERRING. TO SO THE OLDER TO RETRIEVE THE SAN PERCENT RETURN VISIT MARK HOLIDAY -- WE NEED TO YEAH WE NEED THE INNOVATION WAS ALL YOU KNOW PATIENT IT'S LESS LIKELY WILL WE CAN GET THAT TARGETS. BUT DOING INNOVATION -- DOING IT -- THAT THAT -- NEW PIECES MODELED ON THE CONSIDERATION WILL REDUCE THE FEE. WILL HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY NO LIGHTS TRANSPARENCY AND WILL HAVE MORE CONTROL BECAUSE WEB BREEN. A LOT INVESTMENT DECISION AGAIN HOUSE SO WE'LL HAVE MORE CONTROL IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT WHAT KIND OF STRATEGY WE WILL ENGAGE AND WAS A DIRT THAT THE SOCIETAL IMPACT. CURRENTLY. HOLIDAY USING SOME AUTOPAY EASES FROM ALL OF THE HAVE LARGELY TO SAVE OUR LEGAL CONTROL IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF THE INVESTMENT. AND YOU WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION THE TRANSPARENCY THEY CAN SHARE WITH US THE PROPOSES TO BRING A HUFF OF THE IN HOUSE IN OKAY. HOPPING HOLLIS BUT WILL HAVE MORE CONTROL MALL TRANSPARENCY AND LOWER SOCIAL INSTEAD OF JUST. ESSENTIALLY HIRING AN OUTSIDE HEDGE FUND MANAGER WHATEVER ELSE FOR SOME OF THESE THINGS WERE LOOKING AT ACTUALLY HAVING PEOPLE IN HOUSE WHO WILL LOOK AT SOME OF THESE THINGS WORKING WITH. EIGHT EIGHT IS HOPEFULLY NOT HAVE THAT HAPPEN OKAY I I GOT ALL. RIGHT TO BE PARTIALLY AND HOW BUT BRING SOME OF THE IN HOUSE SO THEREFORE WE CAN LOWER THE COSTS AND ALSO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY RIGHT SO YOU WILL HAVE MORE. INFLUENCE IN THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND INFORMATION SHERRY OKAY ART THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAM AND ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS SEE NONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. WE'RE NOT MOVING TO CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM ITEM FIVE ON OUR AGENDA. JACK ENDS IN CHRIS. ALMOND. THIS IS NOT. A JACK. YOUR GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING IT IS STILL MORNING. THANK YOU. PLEASE SERVE AGAIN THANK YOU AND WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M JACKING THIS I'M THE CEO OF CAL STIRS -- I'M SORRY MY EIGHTEENTH YEAR IN THIS ROLE IN THIS ORGANIZATION AND CHRIS HILLMAN IS IN ITS TWENTIETH YEAR IS OUR CHAU. HE COULD NOT BE WITH US TODAY IS OUT OF TOWN -- BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU DO. UNDERSTAND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF THE CYCLES OF THE SYSTEM A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES UNDERSTAND THINGS WE'VE HAD TO CONFRONT. OVER THE YEARS MY OWN BACKGROUNDS INSURANCE INDUSTRY I WORK FOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY IN ALL RIGHT -- FOR MANY YEARS SO I BRING THAT RISK MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE I THINK TO THE WORK WE DO I SEE THIS MUCH LIKE AN INSURANCE COMPANY IT'S MONEY COMING IN WE INVEST THE MONEY AND WE'RE PAYING PEOPLE. REALLY LIFE ANNUITIES SO IT'S REALLY MUCH LIKE A LIFE INSURANCE -- BUSINESS. YOU KNOW FROM AFAR PEOPLE TEND TO LUMP CAL STIRS IN CALPERS TOGETHER THIS IN THAT WE ALL DO THE SAME THINGS IS ALL THE SAME STUFF. BUT ACTUALLY IS IS MARCY HIGHLIGHTED NUYS BUILT WHY WILL TO THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN OUR DEMOGRAPHIC CENTER FUNDING. AND IN OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES ONE THING THAT IS THE SAME THOUGH IS THAT WE ARE FOR DO SHERRY'S OF THE SYSTEM. AND WE CAN'T SAY THAT ENOUGH WE TALK TO YOU ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND TALK ABOUT CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES. THAT PRODUCE SHIRI STANDARD IS MUCH DEBATE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. CONGRESS THE SEC US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STILL HAVE NOT SETTLED ON ON ADEQUATE FIDUCIARY STANDARD FOR SELLING INVESTMENT PRODUCTS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. BUT FOR US HERE IN GOVERNMENT IT'S VERY CLEAR WE ARE ABSOLUTELY FIDUCIARY SO. I WAS GONNA QUICKLY SHARE FOR NUMBERS THAT I SHARE WITH MY BOARD. TO REALLY HOPEFULLY BRING US ALL TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PENSION AND WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT. FOR WHAT WE DO WOULD CAL STIRS. IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE MEDIAN FOR SAVINGS ACCOUNT BALANCE IN THE UNITED STATES. SO THIS IS THE MEDIAN AMOUNT OF MONEY PEOPLE HAVE. IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT. YOU'LL BE SHOCKED AT THE NUMBER THE SIMPLEST NUMBER TO REMEMBER THE NUMBER IS. ZERO AN UNFORTUNATE WHAT YOU READ THE NEWSPAPER ALL THE TIME OUR NUMBERS LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. THE AVERAGE BELCHES ZERO IN OUR COUNTRY. THE PERCENTAGE OF WORKERS THAT HAVE NO RETIREMENT ACCOUNT IS THE PERCENT OF WORKERS THAT FALL SHORT OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE SAVINGS TARGET FOR THEIR AGE. IS 77%. AND THEN FINALLY THE NUMBER THAT SCREAMS AT CAL STIRS WOMEN ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN POVERTY IN RETIREMENT. THAT IS THE PICTURE WE FACE IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS PENSION AND THE GOOD JOB IT DOES FOR PRIMARILY THE WOMEN. BECAUSE 72% OF OUR MEMBERS ARE WOMEN. HOME PORT IN THIS IS WHEN WE GO THROUGH THESE CONTROVERSIES IN CHALLENGES AND POLITICAL CHALLENGES TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS. THIS ISTHAT IMPORTANT TO ALMOST ONE MILLION TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA. REMEMBER THE POPULATION CALIFORNIA'S FORTY MILLION 25% OF THOSE KIDS SO THAT'S THIRTY MILLION ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA ONE OUT OF THIRTY PEOPLE IS A SCHOOL TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA COVERED BY US. DAVID R. I. ARE AREWONDERFUL ACTUAR HIGHLIGHTED VIEW SOME OF THE MORTALITY ISSUES THAT FACE PENSION PLANS. I DID WANT TO MENTION ONE WONDERFUL STATISTIC FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU ALL BECAUSE WE ARE A ONE FEMALE BASED SYSTEM OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THE DIFFERENT MORTALITY. BUT WHAT MAY SURPRISE YOU IS THE WASN'T MENTION IS THAT FEMALE TEACHERS LIVE LONGER THAN FEMALES. SO EVEN WITHIN THAT GENDER THERE IS DIFFERENCES AND WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE PRIMARILY WOMEN. THERE NOW OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD THAT WE PER TO DO SO PICTURE OF THE AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL SECURITY YOU NEED IF YOU RETIRE AT AGE SIXTY TWO AND YOU'RE GONNA LIVE DID. NINETY AT IS INCREDIBLE. WHAT WHEN I WAS BORN? LONG TIME AGO. PEOPLE THE AVERAGE RETIREMENT AGE WAS SEVENTY AND YOU ONLY HAD A PLAN FOR SEVEN YEARS OF RETIREMENT. TODAY RETIRING AT SIXTY TWO SIXTY THREE SIXTY FIVE WHO NEED TO REPLY AND FROM EIGHTY SIX TO NINETY YEARS OLD SO IT'S INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT HAS TO BE ACQUIRED IN SOME WAY IN THESE PENSIONS TO THAT. THE EXACT NUMBER FOR WOMEN IF YOU LIVED AGE SIXTY TWO YOUR LIFE EXPECTANCY IS NOW NINETY AS A CALIFORNIA TEACHER. CREDIBLE. AS WAS MENTIONED OUR TEACHERS DO NOT EARNED SOCIAL SECURITY CREDITS OTHER HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THIS SYSTEM FOR THEIR BENEFIT THEY ALSO DO NOT GET IN THIS IS OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD. MOST OF THE TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA GET ZERO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN RETIREMENT FOR FOR HEALTH CARE. IT IS NOT LIKE STATE EMPLOYEES OR OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS SO THEY MUST TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. AND THEN FINALLY I TALKED OUR TEACHERS ALL THE TIME INTO OUR RETIREES AND I WOULD TELL YOU THERE'S TO TAKE AWAYS FROM THAT I THINK. AGAIN WE HAVE TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THESE PEOPLE ONE THING IS THEY STILL WORRIED IS THE PENSION GOING TO BE THERE FOR THEM I STILL HEAR THAT BECAUSE THEY READ THESE NEWSPAPER STORIES ABOUT THE POLITICAL ISSUES THE CONFLICT ISSUES. AND THEY STILL WANT TO KNOW IS THAT PENSION GOING TO BE THERE FOR THEM AND THE SECOND THING IS THEY WANT TO TEACH THEY DON'T WANT TO BE FINANCIAL EXPERTS. THEY DON'T WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO MANAGE THEIR PORTFOLIO WORD REDO ASSET ALLOCATION FOR M. SS MANAGER FEES THEY WANT CAL STIRS TO DO THAT FOR THEM SO. THOSE ARE TWO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS WE ARE VERY HIGH TOUCH ORGANIZATION WE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA RETIRE AND MANAGER* SUCCESSFULLY YOU CAN'T DO IT BY READING A WEB PAGE TO GET ALL THAT INFORMATION NOW WE ALL HAVE THAT WONDERFUL STUFF. ON THE WEB BUT WE HAVE A VERY EXTENSIVE COUNSELLING SYSTEM WE CONDUCT OVER. 230-002-3000 ONE ON ONE SESSIONS AND WORKSHOPS WITH TEACHERS TEN THOUSAND OF GROUP SESSIONS THIRTEEN THOUSAND COUNTER LOCAL FRONT COUNTER CONVERSATION SO THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS PERSON TO PERSON. SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE DO WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE TAKING CARE OF THEM. I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON THE FUNDING STATUS BECAUSE WE WERE ABSOLUTELY HEADING TOWARD INSOLVENCY BEFORE THE FUNDING BILLS PASSED IN -- TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND THAT WAS A TERRIBLE MESSAGE FOR A YOUNG TEACHER HERE STARTING SCHOOL WHAT HOW WILL THIS HAPPEN SO. THE FUNDING BILL THAT PASSED WAS ABSOLUTELY WHAT WAS NEEDED IT'S A VERY. AS THE LA A WAS A POINTED OUT A NUMBER OF TIMES IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED FUNDING PLANNED UNDERSTAND -- BUT WE DO THINK IT'S DOING THE JOB AND WHAT IT'S IN THE HOW IT'S DEVELOPED. IT PROVIDES FOR SEVEN YEARS OF INCREASE SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH RAISE THEIR RATES FROM EIGHT AND A QUARTER PERCENT TO NINETEEN POINT 1%. WE'RE IN YEAR FIVE OF THAT NOW THE CONCERNS RAISED AROUND THAT AND SCHOOL BUDGETS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH THAT WAS IN FACT THE REASON WHY. THE LEGISLATION PROVIDED A RAMP UP AND WAS NOT SOME IMMEDIATE -- SIGNIFICANT JUMP IN THEIR CONTRIBUTION REQUIRED. OUR FIRST FORMAL REPORT IS DUE TO YOU ON JULY FIRST OF THIS FUNDING PLAN. NOW IT WHERE WE ARE AND DAVID WE JUST READ A FEW MINUTES AGO WILL BE ONE OF THE PRIME AUTHORS OF THAT ALONG WITH RICK READER CHIEF ACTUARY. BUT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE REPORT WILL SAY. WE'RE DOING OKAY. WE'RE DOING OKAY BUT THERE ARE RISKS AROUND THIS IN THE WRIST ALWAYS AROUND LONG TERM INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. THAT'S WHY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WAS SO WELCOME TO BECAUSE AGAIN A PROVIDES JUST A BIT MORE EDGE. TO HELP ON THE FUNDING PLAN OF WHAT WE NEED AND AGAIN VERY VERY PLEASED TO SEE -- THE EARLY -- UP OFFERING OF THAT IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE OF THE S. MARCY PUT SAID WITH CALPERS THERE IT'S 7% WE'RE AT 7%. YOU KNOW THIS NUMBERS BANDIED ABOUT LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE OPINIONS ONTHIS INVESTMENT SOME SHOULD I WANT IT BANNED THAT FOR YOU SO WE GET. SOME SENSE OF ITS NORMALCY -- LET BUSINESS OPTION SO I WENT INTO THE DATABASE FOR THE TOP ONE HUNDRED PRIVATE SECTOR PENSION FUNDS. IS SOMETIMES THIS IS CONSTRUED AS SOME PUBLIC SECTOR DRAMA AROUND THIS ASSUMPTION IF YOU TAKE THE TOP ONE HUNDRED PRIVATE SECTOR PENSION FUNDS. THEIR CURRENT INVESTMENT ASSUMPTION IS SIX POINT 8% ON AVERAGE. IF YOU TAKE THE BODY A PUBLIC PENSION PLANS IN AMERICA THEY JUST RELEASED THAT. OUR TRADE ASSOCIATION JUST RELEASED THAT STUDY THIS WEEK THAT AVERAGES ABOUT SEVEN POINT SO YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THE BOOKENDS TO THAT NUMBER. AND AGAIN REMEMBER. EVEN IN THE ABSTRACT THIS NUMBER IS IT'S A PRECARIOUS THING TO COMPARE. HOW YOU INVEST YOUR MONEY WOULD PROBABLY BE DIFFERENT THAN HOW I INVEST MY MONEY SO THIS NUMBER HAS TO BE A REFLECTION? OF THE ASSET ALLOCATION AND CAN'T BE SOME NUMBER WE PULL OUT OF THIN AIR AND SAY OH IT'S 7% -- NO IT'S 8% DON'T KNOW IT'S 5%. IT HAS TO STEP BE STEM BASICALLY FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF YOUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO SO WILL BE GOING TO THAT EXERCISE AGAIN THIS YEAR AN ASSET ALLOCATION PROCESS WITH OUR BOARD. AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE WILL LOOK AT THE INVESTMENT ASSUMPTION AND IN PLACE OF AN ASSUMPTION IN THE MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE USE IN THE PLAN WE DO THAT EVERY FOUR YEARS. TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON TRACK. LAST COUPLE ISSUES I MENTIONED I DO WANT HAVE INVESTMENT COSTS. BECAUSE THE NUMBERS FOR SYSTEM OUR SIZE OUR CALPERS ARE. TREMENDOUS. ALL WE WERE ONE OF THREE TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC COST REPORT THAT'S ON OUR WEBSITE. THE DETAILS ACROSS EVERY ASSET CLASS NOT JUST PRIVATE EQUITY. BUT EVERY ASSET CLASSES WHAT WE'RE PAYING OUT AND FEES AS WELL WORTH WORKING LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW OF THE PORTFOLIO COSTS FEES FOR THE OUT EXTERNAL MANAGERS EXCEED A BILLION DOLLARS AND IF WE ADDED IN WHAT WE CALL CARRIED INTERESTS AND PRIVATE EQUITY THAT NUMBER GOES TO A ONE POINT. EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. SO IT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE TO SPEND TO MANAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. COSTS ARE WITH THOSE EXTERNAL MANAGERS SO 97%. 3% OF THE COSTS ARE FOR OUR STAFF. YET THEY ONLY MANAGE 56% OF THE ASSETS I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU SEE THAT. THAT CONCEPTUAL CONTRADICTION THERE. SO OUR OWN STAFF IS MANAGING 44% OF THE ASSETS. BUT TAKING UP ONLY 3% OF THE COST. THAT'S THE COST EQUATION WE GOTTA START STRUGGLING WITH ALL OF US IN RECOGNIZE. THE EASIEST WAY TO MAKE MONEY HERE IS NOT MAKING BEST BETS ON THE MARKET IS SAVING ON FEES ALWAYS I MEAN WE SHOULD DO THAT OUR PERSONAL LIFE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS LOOK FIRST TO FEES. THAT IS WHERE THE SWEET SPOT HERE IS FOR CHANGE FOR ALL OF US. NOW I WOULD NEVER SAY TO YOU WE'RE GOING TO BE EXPERTS HERE IN PICKING A PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT IN CHINA. BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE WE CAN DO DIFFERENTLY AND THAT'S WHAT OUR BOARD IN OUR BEST AND STAFF FOR PURSUING NOW IS HOW COULD WE PUSH IT THIS MODEL. AND THINK DIFFERENTLY. THERE IS A LEGEND BACK TO YOU WITH THIS TO THE MORE WE PUSH ON THAT MODEL THE MORE WE THINK MORE. LIKE A PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITY. CAN WE SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THIS WELL WITH SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT APPARATUS AROUND US. THERE ARE MANY PURCHASING HUMAN RESOURCE ISSUES THAT SURROUND WORKING IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND THERE WAS MAY NOT ALWAYS FIT A COMMERCIAL MODEL AND THOSE ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE. FOR EVERY TEN DOLLARS I PAY X. Y. Z. ON WALL STREET I'M GONNA PAY ONE DOLLAR. DO CAL STIRS EMPLOY SO IF WE CAN PUSH ON THAT SUCCESSFULLY IN IT IS THE BE ALL OF IT YOU CAN SAY POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HERE. IN THIS EQUATION. LAST POINT ON DIVEST BUT IF I COULD RESTATEMENT THAT IT'S WITHOUT THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY QUESTION YEAH THAT -- MISTER O'DONNELL REYES DID AND I WANT TO SAY THE OLDER MAN DID I I THINK WE ALL SHOULD LOOK HERE THIS LEARN IT AND HOPEFULLY THOSE ARE WATCHING. OF CAN UNDERSTAND IT IS WELL IT AND I WANNA I WANNA SETTLE DIFFERENTLY THAT'S BEEN CHAD ABOUT SO FAR TODAY IT IS I'D LOOK AT INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THIS IS A GLOBALLY DIVERSE PORTFOLIO ACROSS THE ENTIRE WORLD. IN EVERY INDUSTRY SECTOR. THERE IS WE HAVE TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR SOMETHING BAD GOING ON ALWAYS SOMEWHERE IN BUSINESS. WHETHER IT'S A DAMN THAT BREAKS OF BRAZIL. A PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT THAT TURNS OUT TO BE DANGEROUS CHILD LABOR TO MAKE A CLOTHING PRODUCT. OF COAL. EMISSIONS THESE ARE RISKS THE PERVADE THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO. SO WE CAN'T LOOK AT THIS HAPHAZARDLY AND SAY MY GOSH HERE'S AN ISSUE CERTAINLY LET'S JUMP ON THIS ISSUE. AND AND TAKE THAT OUT OF THE PORTFOLIO IF BE NOTHING LEFT IF WE LOOK AT RISK AND AGAIN I'M GONNA GOT MY INSURANCE. MINDSET ON THIS BECAUSE RISK PER FADES ALL THE PORTFOLIO THIS IS ABOUT HOW TO MANAGE THAT RISK AND HOW TO DO THAT INTELLIGENTLY. SO THERE THERE ARE ISSUES AT TIMES THAT DESERVE THAT LEVEL OF ANALYSIS WHETHER AT WELL WITH THEIR SERVICING THE PORTFOLIO WELL AND BRINGING VALUE. AND THEN WHAT TO DO WITH IT. SO WE AND AND AS AS CALPERS WE HAVE EXTENSIVE STAFF NOW THAT OUR ENGAGEMENT BASED EMPLOYEES. THAT REALLY ARE USING THOSE TECHNIQUES TO ENGAGE A COMPANY AND DISCUSSED BUSINESS STRATEGY AROUND THOSE ISSUES WHETHER IT'S SAFE WORKING PRACTICES WORKING CONDITIONS LABOR PRACTICES -- DIVERSITY ON A BOARD IS A HUGE ISSUE RIGHT NOW -- THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT COULDN'T WHERE WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE'VE GOT A TRACK RECORD DOING IT AND WE PROVIDE A SMALL HAND OUT IN YOUR FOLDER AROUND AS OF THE VARIOUS ENGAGEMENTS THAT WE HAVE GOING ON WHERE WE HAVE IN FACT MOVE THE BALL FOR THIS. ISN'T JUST ABOUT LOVE WRITING A LETTER TO ACCOMPANY THIS IS ACTUALLY SITTING DOWN WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES. BUT I I ENCOURAGE YOU WHEN SOMETHING IS OF CONCERN TO YOU WE'D LET THAT PROCESS HAPPEN. IN EXTREME SITUATIONS MMHM DIVESTMENT MIGHT HAPPEN OUR OWN BOARD HAS IN FACT MADE THAT DECISION SEVERAL TIMES SO I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU IT'S IT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN OUTCOME THAT WOULD WORK. BUT SOMETIMES BUT TO GET TO THAT PROCESS IT SHOULD BE AFTER A VERY LENGTHY FIDUCIARY PROCESS NOT POLITICAL WOULD BE OUR VIEW -- BUT IT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST IT'S IN MY EIGHTEEN YEARS AT CAL STIRS OUR BOARD MEETINGS USED TO BE VERY QUIET -- ENDEAVORS AND INDICT GOT A SHARON HENDRIX RIGHT BEHIND ME HERE AND IN A DILLON FOR MY BOARD AT THE BOOK BOARD CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR AND EVERY SINGLE. BOARD MEETING WE HAVE NOW WE HAVE PROTESTERS OVER SOCIAL ISSUE OF SOME TYPE AND WE TRIED MANAGE IT BUT IT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSION VERY GOOD THANK YOU WAS BANISHED I APPRECIATE YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS AT ALL I'D LIKE TO KEEP THEM TO A VERY MINIMUM IF WE CAN'T WE'RE RUNNING. OUT OF TIME. I THANK YOU. DID THAT YOU MADE YOU ALLUDED TO IT -- AND I KNOW THE SOMETHING COMES UP BEFORE -- THIS COMMITTEE FREQUENTLY THE ISSUE AROUND -- THE CIVIL SERVICE AND SERVE THE COMPENSATION RESTRICTIONS AND SO FORTH AND ONE EXPLORE ALL OF THAT. RIGHT NOW BUT I JUST WANTED A MARKER ON THAT SINCE YOU MENTIONED IT'S BUT I DO THINK AND THIS ACTUALLY DOESN'T JUST AFFECT STIRS AND PURRS ALL THAT YOU WERE HERE AT SO WE RIGHT NOW HAVE EXCEPTIONS. FOR I THINK YOURSELF CO THE INVESTMENT OFFICERS NOW THE OPERATING OFFICERS ETCETERA I THINK WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE WERE ALSO THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE. TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL STRUCTURE WHERE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DO. FRANKLY END RUNS AROUND AND I RECOGNIZE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF COMPENSATION AND THE TYPE OF RECRUITMENT WE CAN DO FOR OUR CIVIL SERVICE BOTH IN OUR RETIREMENT SYSTEMS AND ALSO IN OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. AS WELL I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT WE YOU WE WORK TOGETHER ON THIS CONVERSATION MANY TIMES. AND AND BUT I DO THINK I GIVEN THE SIZE OF THESE VENTURE FEES WE'VE GOT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT CUTTING COSTS NOW THEY ARE. IT IS SOMETHING DEFINITELY TO RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW QUESTIONS THANK YOU HOURS INGRATIATED YOU'LL GET FREE TO THE UPDATE. ITEM NUMBER SIX STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS [inaudible] MR STERN [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SACRAMENTO COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS. AND THE CO CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE FOR THE STATUS OF HIM COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IN TOTAL SO THANK YOU WELCOME. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE -- TO DISCUSS HOW THE COUNTY EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT LAW OF NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN ACT -- WORKS -- AGAIN AMERICA STERN I'M THE CEO OF THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM I ALSO CO CHAIR THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE OF THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS WHICH IS OUR EDUCATION ORGANIZATION FOR THE SYSTEMS. SO WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE IS A LITTLE BIT HISTORY AND WHEN I'M WHEN I'M DOING HERE WHAT IS NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THAT YEAR. CERRO -- LET'S GO BACK TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION THE TIME OF OBVIOUSLY TREMENDOUS INCOME SECURITY ESPECIALLY. FOR OLDER WORKERS WHO HAD NO -- SAFETY THAT ALL THE TIMESO CALPERS WAS FORMED IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO BUT THAT -- WAS ONLY FOR STATE EMPLOYEES AT THE TIME. IT WASN'T UNTIL NINETEEN THIRTY NINE ABOUT SEVEN YEARS LATER THAT THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO PARTICIPATE -- IN CALPERS. AND SO SECURITY CAME AROUND IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE BUT THAT WAS ONLY FOR PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS SO ABOUT GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WERE ALLOWED TO JOIN SO SECURITY UNTIL THE NINETEEN FIFTIES -- SO AT THE TIME IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THERE IS THERE IS A SMALL NUMBER OF LOCAL. INDEPENDENT ON PENSION SYSTEMS MOSTLY AT THE CITY LEVEL FOR POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS AND OBVIOUSLY CASTERS AT THE TEACHERS FUND WAS AROUND THAT TIME. AS WELL SO LEGISLATURE CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA COUNTIES TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT LOCALLY MANAGED RETIREMENT SYSTEMS OFFER COUNTY SYSTEMS UNDER A UNIFORM SET OF RULES AND SO. THAT WAS NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN IN THE NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN ACTON TODAY. WE HAVE TWENTY COUNTIES THAT OPERATE UNDER THE PARAMETERS OF THAT -- OF THAT LEGISLATION MOST OF THE SYSTEMS REFORM THE NINETEEN FORTIES AT A TIME WHEN GOVERNMENT -- WAS GROWING INTO A INTO A MORE ROBUST FIRST AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS WERE BECOMING A STANDARD PART OF THE COMPENSATION PACKAGE. SO THE TWENTY COUNTY SYSTEMS TODAY MANAGE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS. ON BEHALF OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREES AND OUR BENEFICIARIES RANGE IN SIZE FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH HAS ABOUT HALF OF THE ASSETS DOWN TO THE MENDOCINO COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH IS ABOUT A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS. SO WHERE MEMBERS ARE YOUR SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES LOCAL PROSECUTORS AND PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE COUNTY ASSESSORS AND TAX COLLECTORS COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS HEALTHCARE WORKERS -- OTHER DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS. VERY SIMILAR TO THE STATEWIDE SYSTEMS THAT CALPERS AND CAL STIRS -- JUST LET'S IN THE SENSE THAT WE WE OPERATE UNDER -- UNDER THE SAME CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS AS FIGHTING SHERRY'S. WE PROVIDE A LIFETIME GUARANTEE PENSION BENEFITS BASED ON FORMULA AT YOUR SERVICE AGE. OUR OUR MEMBERS OF THE COUNTY SYSTEM ARE SUBJECT TO THE OUT TO PEPPER THE PENSION REFORM ACT OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ON FOR TWO SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE LEGACY MEMBERS THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ARE SUBJECT -- TO TO TO A SIMILAR SET OF BENEFITS AS CALPERS MEMBERS THE PERSON WHO WANTS IS DEALING WITH WHAT COUNTS TOWARDS COMPENSATION BUT OVERALL IT'S IT'S CHEN WITH THE SAME -- THE SAME FRAMEWORK. WE OPERATE AS A TRUST FUND SEPARATE FROM THE COUNTY -- SUBJECT OPEN MEETINGS LAWS. ANNUAL ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS AUDITS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE THOUGH BETWEEN THE COUNTY SYSTEMS AND THIS BIG STATEWIDE SYSTEMS IS THAT WE THE EACH SYSTEM IS REALLY THE IS IT'S IT'S THE ON THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE SO EACH SYSTEM HAS A LOCAL RETIREMENT BOARD. AND WE DON'T HAVE ONE RETIREMENT FOR THE A TWENTY INDEPENDENT RETIREMENT BOARD'S. LIMIT ABOVE ELECTED EMPLOYEES A RETIREE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS APPOINTEES AND THE COUNTY TREASURER. AND LOCAL CONTROL -- MEANS LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY -- PLAN MEMBERS THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE A LOT OF A LOT MORE ACCESS TO ON TO US. AND I THINK A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP. TO THE THE BIGGEST THAT PART ONE OF THE BIGGER DIFFERENCE IS ALSO IS THAT -- SO CALPERS HAS THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYERS SAID ROUGHLY -- INTO A THIRD THE STATE A THIRD SO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN A THIRD -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE COUNTY SYSTEMS THE COUNTY IS THE DOMINANT MAIN EMPLOYER -- IT'S USUALLY ABOUT 90% OF THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP. OR MORE SO WE HAVE A REALLY REALLY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH -- WITH THE COUNTY. AND WHAT WE HAVE SORT OF A LOWER PROFILE IN THE BIG STATES SYSTEMS WE DO AS STRIVE TO BE A GOOD RESOURCE FOR STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE SERVICE AN HONEST BROKER OF INFORMATION TO HELP YOU. MAKE DECISIONS UNDERSTAND LEGISLATION THE COME I COME YOUR WAY AFFECTING US. THAT'S ABOUT IT VERY GOOD THANK YOU UP COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE AND WHAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE TODAY FACING THE THIRTY SEVEN ACT. COUNTIES IN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS. I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE TODAY IS REALLY -- THE TRANSITION TO FOR A IN DEALING WITH WHAT COUNTS AS COMPENSATION. FOR THE LEGACY MEMBERS AND THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE SEEING ALL THE LITIGATION THAT'S FOR THE BEFORE THE STATE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW THAT WE'RE ALL WATCHING REALLY CLOSELY. SO -- IN THE COUNTY AND THE COUNTY WORLD. WE BASED ON A LONG HISTORY OF OF COURT DECISIONS AND AND SETTLEMENTS OF AGE COUNTY SYSTEM. TO CRAFTED THEIR OWN SET OF RULES ABOUT WHAT COUNTS TOWARDS COMPENSATION -- THEY CAN BE USED TO CALCULATE YOUR PENSION BENEFITS FOR THESE LEGACY MEMBERS. AND TAPPARA ESTABLISHED -- A LOT STRICTER RULES ABOUT THAT ON A AND A MUCH TIGHTER STANDARD AND ALSO GAVE DIRECTION TO THE KIND RETIREMENT SYSTEMS -- TO TO GO BACK AND MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE WAS IN AN APPROPRIATELY ENHANCING PENSION BENEFITS. AND WHAT THAT MEANS REALLY KIND OF OPENS A PANDORA'S BOX OF WHAT LITTLE NUANCES OF YOUR COMPENSATION COUNT AND WHAT TOWN AND THAT GETS VERY HOT LEGALLY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CASES THAT. HAVE -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OF I THINK IT'S PRO BIGGEST ISSUES OF IF THE COURT GIVES US DIRECTION HOW WE ON WINE SOME OF THOSE OR WHERE WE KIND OF GOT MOVED GOING FORWARD AND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT BE CONFRONTED WITH AT THAT POINT. TWO INTERESTED IN IS MISTER MISTER STERN WHEN YOU HAVE THAT. THE TWENTY DIFFERENT. THREE SEVEN ACT COUNTIES IN THERE INDEPENDENT RETIREMENT SYSTEMS WE TALKED ABOUT THE RATE OF RETURN OR THE RETURN THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THE LARGER SYSTEMS OR IS THERE A OF WHICH THE RANGE THAT SURE YEAH YET SO IT SO BECAUSE THERE'S TWENTY SYSTEMS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE BIT. OF DEVIATION -- I WOULD SAY GENERALLY THE THE ASSUME RIGHT OF RETURN FOR MOUSE THE SYSTEMS IS ABOUT 7% BUT IT CAN RANGE ON SAM CEREBUS US A MATTEO -- COUNTY EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SATIATION HAS I THINK IT'S SIX POINT 75% INVESTMENT ASSUMPTION BUT SOME SYSTEMS ARE STILL ABOUT SEVEN A QUARTER BUT THEY'RE ALL TRENDING TRENDING DOWN BECAUSE WE WE HAVE THOSE TRY ANY OLDER. QUADRENNIAL REVIEWS OF OTHER OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT IT'S THEIR SORT OF A MAYBE A LAG BUT I THINK YOU'RE SAYING EVERYONE COME DOWN AT THAT 7% LEVEL BUT REALLY LOOKING TO THE FEW KNOWS CHARACTERS OTHER SORT OF LOOKING AT THE NEXT SET OF ASSUMPTIONS WHAT YOUR WAY FROM LOOKING. RIVER RE REVIEWING THAT. INTEREST INTEREST RATE AND INTEREST OUR INFLATION ASSUMPTION IS REALLY THE BIG ONE THAT EVERYONE'S KIND OF WATCHING THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY BEEN SORT OF PUSHING DOWN THE THE OVERALL ASSUMPTION RIGHT OR THAT THOSE THAT ARE ACTUALLY GETTING A RATE OF RETURN IT'S MUCH LOWER THAN THAT OR MUCH HIGHER. INTERVIEW THE ACTUAL ACTUAL RHETORIC TURNS. SURE I MEAN YOU CAN DEVIATE ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS AT SACRAMENTO COUNTY WE HAD A 10% RETURN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR BUT THIS YEAR JUST BASED ON THE VOLATILITY MARKETS IT'S IT'S NOT GONNA AT WILL BE LUCKY TO HEAD -- IN OUR 7% ASSUMPTIONS HERE. INTERESTING SO YOU HELP THE HIGHS OUTWEIGH THE LOWS YET NO ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE A QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER STERN CREATED VERY MUCH. COMMENTS WILL NOW GO TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES FOR SAVINGS PLUS PROGRAM. STRENGTHENED JONES AND MISS. RECKLESS IT SHOULD SAID POSSIBLE THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU. GREETINGS CHAIRMAN HILL AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I MAJOR JINKINS TOWNS AND I AM THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THEIR POP IN HUMAN RESOURCES CALLIE CHAR -- WE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY SO WE CAN GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF OUR SECOND PLUS PROGRAM THAT IS ADMINISTERED BY COUNTY CHAR -- DISABLED PLUS PROGRAM IS A FOUR ONE K. AND FOUR FIFTY SEVEN P. PLANS AVAILABLE TO MOST STATE. OF CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF THE LEGISLATURE. JUDICIAL CALIFORNIA STATE YOU PROGRAM IS 1100% VOLUNTARY -- WITH THE MINIMUM. PAY ROLL ON TO MAKE DEDUCTION OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH AN EMPLOYEE CAN START A SAVINGS PLUS PROGRM. ACCOUNT UP. AS OF JANUARY -- TWENTY NINETEEN THE PROGRAM HAS APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND NINETEEN THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS AND THEY COMBINED ASSETS OF ABOUT FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS -- AS MY WORLD IS ACTING DIRECTOR FOR CALAIS CHAR I AM STILL FIDUCIARY FOR THE SAVINGS PLUS PROGRAM. I HAVE HERE WITH ME TODAY MICHELLE THE CAGES WHO IS OUR ADMINISTRATOR OF THE SAVINGS PLUS PROGRAM AND SHE WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE PROGRAM GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING -- AS A DRESS SAID I'M MICHELLE BERKELEY SUCH THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PROGRAM -- WE DO ADMINISTER A FOUR FIFTY SEVEN AND A FOUR ONE K. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN. I'M AS SHE INDICATED IT'S NOT COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY -- BUT OUR PURPOSE IS TO SUPPLEMENT THAT PENSION PROGRAM FOR STATE EMPLOYEES -- OUR ULTIMATE PURPOSE IS TO HELP -- EMPOWER THE CALIFORNIA STATE EMPLOYEES. TO BY OFFERING THEM SIMPLE THINKING SOLUTIONS -- THE FOUR FIFTY SEVEN PLAN WAS FIRST OFFERED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR SO THIS WILL BE OUR FORTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY -- THE FOUR ONE K. PLAN WAS ADDED IN -- NINETEEN NINETY NINE SO STUDIES SHOW THAT THE REPLACEMENT RATIO FOR EMPLOYEES WHEN THEY RETIRE I'M BEING THE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR CURRENT INCOME THAT THEY'LL NEED TO LIVE THE SAME LIFESTYLE IN RETIREMENT IS APPROXIMATELY 8290% -- WHAT WE FOUND IS STATE EMPLOYEES -- ON AVERAGE RETIRE AT THE AGE OF SIXTY WITH ABOUT 50% OF THEIR CURRENT INCOME. LEAVING A GAP OF 3240% -- SO THAT'S WHERE WE COME INTO PLAY -- SOME FOLKS DO RECEIVES OF SECURITY BENEFIT BUT AS YOU HEARD EARLIER NOT ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES -- TO SO WE OFFER -- TAX ADVANTAGED -- OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE EMPLOYEES TO TO SAVE FOR THEIR RETIREMENT WE HAVE BOTH THE PRE TAX OPTION -- WHERE THEY CAN PUT THEIR MONEY IN BEFORE TAXES ARE TAKEN -- WHICH SERVES TO LOWER THEIR TAXABLE INCOME FOR THE YEAR -- AND THEN ALSO IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN IT WE OFFERED A ROTH AFTER TAX OPTION. ON AND THE SICK AS INDICATED THEY ON THE DEDUCTION OF COME OUT AFTER TAXES BUT THE EMPLOYEES WILL RECEIVE A TAX FREE DISTRIBUTION RETIREMENT -- WE FIND THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO FEEL AS THOUGH THEY'RE GONNA BE IN A HIGHER TAX BRACKET OR TERMINATE OR IF. LIKE THE ATTACKS RATES WILL INCREASE -- BY THE TIME THAT THEY RETIRE. WE CURRENTLY HAVE 7% OF OUR INCOMING CONTRIBUTIONS GOING INTO THE ROCK FEATURE SO IT'S IT'S PICKING UP INTEREST -- UNLIKELY PENSION STRUCTURE -- OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS MUCH DIFFERENT WERE NOT GOVERNED BY A BOARD STRUCTURE -- AS EAGER INDICATED THE DIRECTOR OF CAL H. R. SERVICES SOLD AN AND DELEGATES THE RESPONSIBILITIES TO ADMINISTER MINISTER THE PROGRAM -- TO SECONDS PLUS. SO WE SERVICE FOR THE SHARES AS WELL -- AND OUR MAIN GOAL IS IS TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM -- FOR THE THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES. I'M WE GOVERN THE PROGRAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE -- OUR OUR PLAN DOCUMENT WHICH BASICALLY DESCRIBES HOW WE WILL ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE -- THOSE KIND DOCUMENTS ARE SUBMITTED TO THE IRS TO REVIEW -- TO AFFIRM THAT WE ARE MINISTERING THE PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR THE RULES. OUR WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO A RISA -- AS A GOVERNMENTAL PLAN HOWEVER WE DO USE IRIS THE GUIDELINES TO KIND OF HELP -- GUIDE THE PLAN AND USE IT AS BEST -- WE DO HAVE AN ADMIN AND INVESTMENT COMMITTEE ON THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING THE FUND STRUCTURE -- OF OUR PORTFOLIO AND MONITORING ALL INVESTMENT PROVIDERS. ENSURING THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING OUR INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT -- FUNDING THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION THIS MORNING ABOUT FUNDING -- OUR PROGRAM IS SELF FUNDED WE DO NOT RECEIVE ANY GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS TO HELP US ADMINISTERED PLAN -- TORE REVENUE SOURCES ARE OUR PARTICIPANTS -- WE CHARGE AN ADMINISTRATIVE FEE OF A DOLLAR FIFTY PER MONTH PER PLAN -- PARTICIPANTS CAN HAVE BOTH A FOR FIFTY SEVEN AND A FOUR ONE K. PLAN -- WE ALSO -- RECEIVE FIVE BASIS POINTS AND REVENUE SHARING FROM ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS. AND WE ADMINISTER A SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM IT'S CUT FIXING THE CONSERVATIVE SO WE RECEIVED JUST I'M A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM THAT PROGRAM. HOW WE OPERATE IN AN UNBUNDLED STRUCTURE -- WHICH MEANS THAT WE CONTRACT -- FOR INDIVIDUAL SERVICES WE HAVE -- THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR THAT DOES OUR RECORD KEEPING -- THEY RUN OUR WEBSITE -- A CALL CENTER -- WE WORK WITH ANOTHER ORGANIZATION WHO PROVIDES TRUSTEE CUSTODIAL SERVICES -- WE HAVE TWO CONSULTANTS THAT WE WORK WITH WHEN CONSULTANT IS RESPONSIBLE THERE -- THEY'RE BOTH ON RETAINER ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING OUR PORTFOLIO LINE UP. AND HELPING US WITH OTHER PLAN DESIGN DECISIONS. AND ALL OF OUR PROVIDER SEARCHES. AND THE OTHER FIRM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PERFORMANCE MONITORING. WE FELT LIKE IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THOSE TWO ROLE SEPARATE -- OUR INVESTMENT STRUCTURE -- WERE A TEE A THREE TIERED STRUCTURE -- OUR FIRST HERE IS -- CONSISTS OF FOURTEEN INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT OPTIONS -- IT CONSISTS OF BOTH INDEX PASSIVELY MANAGED FUNDS AS WELL AS ACTIVELY MANAGED FUNDS -- OUR NEXT TIER IS TARGET DATE FUNDS. I'M SURE YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT TARGET DATE FUNDS -- OUR CUSTOMIZE FUNDS WE DON'T USE OFF THE SHELF FUNDS. THEIR COMPRISED OF OUR AND DRILLING CORE FUNDS -- AND WE WORK WITH OUR CONSULTANTS TO DEVELOP OUR OUR GLIDE PATH AND THE STRUCTURE OF THOSE FUNDS -- THEN THE THIRD TIER IS A BROKERAGE OPTION -- WE WORK WITH CHARLES SCHWAB TO PROVIDE US OUR BROKERS OPTION AND THIS PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTICIPANTS EMPLOYEES THAT WANT TO INVEST OUTSIDE OF OUR PORTFOLIO LINEUP -- AND THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE SECURITIES BONDS ADDITIONAL MUTUAL FUNDS -- SOME OPTIONS SO GIVE THEM A LOT OF YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT COST AYE JACK WAS POINTING OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COSTS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL -- WHEN WE GOT FOR BED FOR OUR INVESTMENT MANAGERS -- WE SCRUTINIZE THAT THE COST -- OF THOSE OF PROVIDERS. AND AS A LARGE PLAN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO USE A VEHICLE THAT'S REFER TO A SEPARATE ACCOUNTS -- WHICH PROVIDES THIS YEAR FOR TO ME TO PROVIDE AND INVESTMENT OPTION AT A MUCH LOWER COST THAN YOU WOULD FROM A RETAIL MUTUAL FUND -- JUST TO KIND OF GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF OUR RANGE OF COSTS -- ARE INDEX FUNDS RANGE FROM SIX BASIS POINTS TO TWELVE BASIS POINTS. ARE ACTIVELY MANAGED FUNDS RANGE FROM ELEVEN BASIS POINTS TO SIXTY TWO BASIS POINTS -- AND THEN OUR TARGET DATE FUNDS -- RANGE FROM NINETEEN BASIS POINTS TO THIRTY BASIS POINTS -- AND AND THE MOST OF OUR CONTRACTS WE HAVE A MOST FAVORED NATIONS CLAUSE IN OUR CONTRACTS WHICH MEANS. THAT IF THE PROVIDER WERE TO PROVIDE THE SAME STRATEGY TO ANOTHER AB PLAN -- AT A LOWER COST THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PASS AT LOWER COST ON TO US AS WELL -- OUR PROGRAM IS A SELF DIRECTED PROGRAM WHICH MEANS THAT THE INDIVIDUALS -- I RESPONSIBLE FOR ELECTING HOW MUCH THEY WANNA TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PLAN AND WHERE THEY WANT INVEST THEIR ASSETS -- WE OFFER BOTH -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE ON THE SET DOT -- AND THEN JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST ON A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME -- THANKS TO OUR PARTNERS AT STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE -- WE FEEL LIKE THAT'S A REAL BENEFIT BECAUSE AS INDIVIDUALS INCOME INCREASES THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE ALONG WITH THAT -- AS YOU WELL KNOW CALIFORNIA AND HAS A VERY DIVERSE POPULATION -- AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE DIVERSITY AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. AGE INCOME -- IT'S OF COMMUNICATION -- AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO TRAIN AND DRESS -- ALL OF THOSE DEMOGRAPHICS -- ONE OF CHARACTERS CORE. VALUES IS DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION -- AND SO WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY WITH OUR PROGRAM. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS -- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE MONEY FOR THEIR RETIREMENT -- SO WITH THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT INVESTING IS A DIFFICULT DECISION -- A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTIMIDATED. BY THE FACT OF TRYING TO SELECT HOW TO INVEST THEIR ASSETS. SO WITH OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WE WE KIND OF BUCKET INTO THREE DIFFERENT WAYS TO INVEST -- THE FIRST ONE IS TO THE AND THAT'S WHERE WE PUSH OUR TARGET DATE FUNDS -- THE TARGET DATE FUNDS AGAIN ARE. AN ASSET ALLOCATION FIND THAT'S DEVELOPED FROM MARK CORE FUNDS -- YOU BASICALLY JUST NEED TO KNOW AT WHAT POINT TIME YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GONNA START HAVING TO TAP INTO YOUR ASSETS. AND YOU PICK THE TARGET DATE THAT PLACE TO THAT -- THE RE BALANCE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND THEY BECOME MORE CONSERVATIVE AS YOU REACH THE TARGET DATE. WITH A LIKE THAT'S A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS THAT. ARE INVESTMENT SAVVY AND ARE KIND OF FEARFUL OF HAVING TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS -- THE SECOND IS THE MANAGE IT FOR ME SO WE HAVE A MANAGED ACCOUNT OPTION -- WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS THE PRO ACCOUNT -- AND THAT BASICALLY IF YOU'RE PAYING US A SEPARATE FEE -- IT'S A TIERED STRUCTURE STARTING AT FIFTY BASIS POINTS AND IT GOES DOWN TO THIRTY FIVE DEPENDING UPON THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS THAT YOU HAVE -- AND YOU'RE TURNING OVER THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR ACCOUNT TO BE A PROFESSIONAL MANAGERS WHO WILL DO THE WORK FOR YOU -- AND THEN THE THIRD IS FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN MONEY -- THAT THE DO IT YOURSELF -- THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO AS INDICATED SELECT FROM OUR CORE FUNDS AS WELL AS UTILIZE OUR BROKERAGE ACCOUNT -- WE CURRENTLY HAVE FIVE PER AND THAT UTILIZE THE BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. AND 4% THAT USE THE PRO ACCOUNT MINCED MANAGE FEATURE -- ANOTHER THING THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED TO TRY AND HELP ENCOURAGE OUR PARTICIPANTS TO TO SAVE AN INCREASE THEIR SAVINGS AND IS IMPLEMENTED SOME AUTO FEATURES -- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE ROLLED OUT -- AN AUTOMATIC INCREASE FUTURE SO. AN EMPLOYEE CAN GO IN AND AND I'M AT THIS SELECT A MONTH STATES JULY. TO EVERY JULY THEY WANT THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE BY A SPECIFIC PERCENTAGE OR A DOLLAR AMOUNT. THEN THEY CAN KIND OF SET IT AND FORGET IT AND GO OFTEN AND TAKE CARE OF OTHER BUSINESS -- WE ALSO HAVE AN AUTO REBALANCE FEATURE -- SO FOR PRINCE PARTICIPANTS THAT ELECT TO SELECT THEIR OWN FUND LINEUP -- ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OUR SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICALLY GO IN AND RE BALANCE IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ALLOCATION -- WE UTILIZE OUR TARGET DATE FUNDS AS A DEFAULT OPTION SO. FOR EMPLOYEES THAT ENROLL USING OUR ON ONLINE -- OUR ENROLLMENT FORM -- THEY DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE WHERE TO PUT THEIR MANY WILL AUTOMATICALLY DEFAULT THEM INTO THE TARGET DATE FUND -- SOAKED SO THAT'S KIND OF ADDRESSING -- A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. THAT DIVERSITY WE ALSO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COMMUNICATION AND OUTREACH -- YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S INDIVIDUALS THAT STILL WANT THAT PERSONALIZED SERVICE AND THERE SOME THAT. JUST WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT DO ON THEIR OWN. SO WE PROVIDE OPTIONS FOR BOTH -- WE HAVE A CALL CENTER THAT IS OPEN -- FROM FIVE AM IN THE MORNING TO EIGHT PM AT NIGHT MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY -- TO ANSWER QUESTIONS HELP PARTICIPANTS AB TRANSACTIONS TRANSACTIONS -- AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT WENT THAT ONE TO ONE ON ONE FACE TO FACED. WE HAVE SEVEN LICENSED -- RETIREMENT SPECIALISTS. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THERE EACH HAVE A DESIGNATED REGION WITH IN CALIFORNIA -- AND THEY MEET ONE ON ONE WITH OUR PARTICIPANTS TO REVIEW THEIR ACCOUNTS ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS -- THEY ALSO PROVIDE WORKSHOPS -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- IN ADDITION IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE A WALK IN CENTER -- WHERE PARTICIPANTS CAN COME IN AND HAVE THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED WE ALSO HAVE A LICENSE REP THERE SO THEY CAN SET UP A ONE ON ONE APPOINTMENT WITH THEM? WE SERVICE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EMPLOYEES -- I'M GOING TO ASK IF YOU COULD WRAP IT UP PLEASE CERTAINLY I FINAL POINTED WE'RE OUT IN THE LAST. CERTAINLY SO A BIG BASS I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF OUR PROGRAM -- THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE WE WE FOCUS A LOT ON EDUCATION OUT REACH BECAUSE IT IS A VOLUNTARY PLAN -- AND WE JUST WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. A WE HAVE A CURRENT 59% PARTICIPATION OF STATE EMPLOYEE IN PLACE THAT'S VERY NICE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU THINK AND I'M ONE OF THOSE. AND IT'S A WONDERFUL PLANS VERY EASY TO USE AND TO TO THE ONLINE FEATURES OF EXTRAORDINARY SO THANK YOU FOR THINK YOU. VERY CONVENIENT QUESTION. GOT VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION. WE'RE NOW GOING TO OUR FINAL PANEL OF THE RETIREMENT SECURITY SO THOSE WHO. ARE ON THE PANEL PLEASE COME FORWARD AND WE WILL KIND OF MOVE DOWN THE THE LINE IN AND IT REALLY HEAR FROM. THOSE WHO. DISSIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM AND AND THOSE WHO HAVE -- I I BELIEVE THE THE BEST KNOWLEDGE OF THE THE BENEFIT OF OUR STATE RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND HOW IT WORKS SO WELL -- GIVEN. THANK YOU -- THE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- FORTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY THANK YOU -- GONNA TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT OUR ASSOCIATION LITTLE BIT ABOUT SPECIAL DISTRICTS AS A WHOLE THE BENEFITS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS -- AS WELL AS RESPOND TO A COUPLE EVEN IF I COULD IS THERE WERE JUST A LITTLE. BIT ABOUT. TWENTY MINUTES LEFT AND SO IF WE COULD KIND OF FIT THAT IN GREAT I WILL MAKE IT I WILL MAKE. THIS POSSIBLE AND CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WE'RE A NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING -- THE TWO THOUSAND SPECIAL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE PROVIDE. LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT -- INSURANCE -- A NUMBER OF OTHER SERVICES FOR THOSE DISTRICTS WE REPRESENT. FIRE DISTRICTS WATER DISTRICTS UTILITY DISTRICTS COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS ARE PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING ELSE THAT INTO THE WORD DISTRICT OTHER THAN SCHOOL DISTRICT -- WE PROVIDE A FIRE PROTECTION FOR MORE THAN ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE -- WE PROVIDE WATER AND WASTEWATER -- OPERATE MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL ACCESS HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. AND EMPLOYEE OVER NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE RECEIVING A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION. WITH REGARD TO THE PENSIONS -- SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHER PRESENTERS -- DIVIDE BUT IF IT PENSIONS -- TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT TOOL WHEN IT COMES TO ATTRACTING AND RETAINING EMPLOYEES -- WHEN IT COMES TO ATTRACTING EMPLOYEES WE'RE COMPETING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR? AND JUST JUST LIKE THEM WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE A COMBINATION OF BENEFITS WHETHER IT'S JOB OPPORTUNITIES. PAY OR BENEFITS AND WHERE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE AS WELL WITH THEM. ON THE PAY. THE AND HELPS LEVEL THAT THAT PLAYING GROUND -- THE MAJORITY OF PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS YOU'RE OFFERING A VEHICLE SUCH AS A FOUR OH ONE K. PLAN. AND THE FUNDING OF THOSE PLANS ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC CHANGES. AS THE EMPLOYERS HAVE THE ABILITY CHANGE OR EVEN STOP -- THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS THE STABILITY OF A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES PROVIDES GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES -- IN ADDED LEVEL OF SECURITY WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING THEIR RETIREMENT -- WE FOUND EMPLOYEES DROPPED MORE WILLING TO WORK FOR A LITTLE LESS. MONEY IN THE FRONT AND WITH THAT SECURITY OF A PREDICTABLE RETIREMENT -- AT IN THE FUTURE. AND WHILE THE FIVE BENEFIT PLANS ARE HELPFUL IN ATTRACTING EMPLOYEES THEY PLAY AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN RETAINING EMPLOYEES -- AS AN EMPLOYEE'S AGE THEY TYPICALLY BEGIN TO FOCUS ON THEIR FINANCIAL FUTURE AND LESS ON THEIR IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL NEEDS. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH A PREDICTABLE AGE OF RETIREMENT -- THAT COMES WITH THE FORECAST BULL AND PERMANENT SOURCE OF INCOME -- THIS PREDICTABILITY PROVIDE SECURITY TO ALLOW EMPLOYEES THE OPPORTUNITY TO RETIRE WITH DIGNITY. AS THEY ENTER THEIR GOLDEN YEARS -- THE SECURE WORK FORCES PROVIDING YOU CENTRAL CORE SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC -- WHEN THEY DIDN'T PUT THE SWITCH ON THE EXPECTED LIGHTS TO BE ANA WHEN THEY IN TURN ON THE FAUCET THEY EXPECT CLEAN WATER TO COME OUT -- A LOT OF THE WORK IS DONE BY OUR SPECIAL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES IS HIGHLY TECHNICAL IN NATURE. REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TRAINING AND IN MANY CASES REQUIRES. STATE CERTIFICATION AND LICENSING -- AS AS A FOR A FOR EXAMPLE OUR MOSQUITO VECTOR CONTROL DISTRICTS -- PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THE WEST VALLEY MISKITO VECTOR CONTROL DISTRICT AND ASSEMBLYMAN RODRIGUEZ DISTRICT PROVIDE SERVICE FOR OVER -- SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS. AND THE IN PEAK SEASON IF EMPLOYEES WERE. TO LEAVE -- THERE COULD BE SICK VIRUS AS A RESULT OF EMPLOYEES NOT STAYING IN THEIR POSITION WAS SCRATCHING GO. RIGHT. OF SO. MY MY POINT IS A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS NOT ONLY BENEFIT THE EMPLOYEES THAT RECEIVE THEM -- BUT THE PUBLIC AS WELL WHO RECEIVING THE THE BENEFITS FROM THESE EMPLOYEES -- MORE BRIEFLY TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF COMMENTS FROM FROM EARLIER EDGE AND JUST -- ONE TO REITERATE THE POINTS ON DIVEST MEANT THAT THAT SIGNIFICANT WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISCOUNT RATE -- IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US THAT THE DISCOUNT RATE IS ACCURATE. THAT IT NOT BE ARBITRARILY SET AT A HIGHER LEVEL TO SAVE OUR EMPLOYERS MONEY -- WHAT HAPPENS IF THE DISCOUNT RATE IS NOT MET? IS THAT -- FUNDED LIABILITY GOES UP AND THAT THAT THE TOTAL COST OF THAT UNFUNDED LIABILITY AT THIS TIME IS BORED BY THE EMPLOYER. SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US THAT THAT AT THAT NUMBER WE'RE FACING A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH WITH RATES GOING UP WE BELIEVE THAT THE PLANS THAT ARE IN PLACE -- AT WILL PROVIDE THE STABILITY IN THE FUTURE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE HIGHER COSTS ARE OFFSET BY THE BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE -- TO KEEP IN RETAIN THOSE EMPLOYEES. PRETTY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING MORNING JEFF NEAL WITH CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THINK INVITING US PROVIDING US TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION TODAY -- AT SEA TAC OBVIOUSLY WE REPRESENT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE IN THE STATE. ANY OF THOSE ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN OF THEM ARE. ARE IN CALPERS THE OTHERS AS YOU AS YOU HEARD EARLIER ARE IN INDEPENDENT RETIREMENT SYSTEMS AND ABOUT HALF OF OUR COUNTIES -- PARTICIPATE IN THE CALPERS HEALTH PLAN AS WELL. AS JUST WON A SECOND A LOT OF THINGS THAT -- DILLON AT GIVEN SAID IS -- YOU KNOW THAT PENSIONS ARE KEY TO RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION WAS BEING COUNTIES HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF EMPLOYEES FROM -- SOCIAL WORKERS TO SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES TO OBVIOUSLY OF THE PEOPLE THAT THAT MANAGE AND RUN THE THE FACILITIES THAT COUNTIES HAVE. OR PROVIDE -- PROVIDE PROGRAM THE SECURITY THAT THE DEFINED BENEFIT -- PROGRAMS PROVIDE IS IS KEY AND YOU KNOW WHEN IMPORTANT TO BOTH THE THE SUPERVISORS AND THE EMPLOYEES -- BUT AGAIN WE'RE SENSITIVE TO THE COSTS JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE AND AND AS THE AS STONE SAID ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE THE UNFUNDED COSTS BEING BORNE BY. BY THE EMPLOYERS IS -- YOU KNOW IS IT SOMETHING THAT WARRANTS CLOSE ATTENTION BUT GIVEN THE TIME CONSTRAINTS HELD AND MY COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN -- HELEN CHAIRMAN EVERY GUEST -- MY NAME IS RANDY CHICKEN ON THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR OUR PA WHICH IS THE RETIRED PUBLIC AND SO HE'S HE'S -- PLOYS ASSOCIATION AND I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO RECEIVED A CALPERS AT PENSION AND VERY THANKFUL TO RECEIVE WHAT I GOT OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FORMER PUBLIC SERVANTS. RETIRED STATE WORKERS CITY WORKERS COUNTY WORKERS SPECIAL DISTRICTS. RETIREES OF FROM FORMER TEACHERS POLICE OFFICERS NURSES COLLEGE PROFESSIONALS. AND MANY MORE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WHO RECEIVE A CALPERS PENSION. OUR MISSION IS TO PRESERVE THE THREE LEGGED RETIREMENT STILL PURRS SO SECURITY AND OF COURSE SAVINGS. WE WORK WITH CALPERS AND HOW TO IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCTS AND WE LET THEM KNOW WHEN WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. SOME OF THEIR ACTIONS AS MARCY WILL TELL YOU WE WERE VERY VOCAL -- WE KEEP TRACK OF WHAT IS GOING ON WITH SO SECURITY AND WE LETTER LEGISLATORS KNOW IF THERE ARE ISSUES WITH. THE SOCIAL SECURITY ISSUES. AND TO HELP OUR MEMBERS SAVE MONEY -- THEM WILL LET YOU KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR CHARACTER WAS RETIREES ONLY SEE FOR ABOUT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. IN RETIREMENT FROM CALPERS THAT'S THE AVERAGE. SO WE OFFER. SUPPLEMENTAL -- PROGRAMS FOR DENTAL AND IN A VISION CARE. FOR THOSE MEMBERS WHO ARE FROM LOCAL AGENCIES THAT DON'T PROVIDE. A VISION AND DENTAL SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR BIG PRODUCT THAT WE OFFER A LOT OF THE AND RETIREES. IN AS GOVERNOR NEWS AND NOTED IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE. THE SENIOR POPULATION. WE BABY BOOMERS. IS -- IS INCREASING AND GROWING MORE AND MORE. SO WE APPRECIATE WHAT CALPERS DOES FOR US AND ARE PAYS GOALS IS TO SEE THAT. ALL RETIREES RETIRE AND DIGNITY. SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR THANK ALLOWING A LADY HERE AND WE ARE. HERE YOUR SERVICE IN THE PAST SERVICE AT YOUR HEAD IS CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT. FOR RETIREMENT AS IT RELATES TO EDUCATORS -- I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT -- THAT CHECKING IS WITHOUT CAL STAR HEAD IS NOTED THAT 72% OF CALPERS MEMBERS ARE WOMEN SO THIS IS A WOMEN'S ISSUE IN THAT OFTEN GETS LEFT OUT OF THE DISCUSSION AS WE TALK ABOUT DOLLARS AND CENTS IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING UP PHASE SO. WE CAN ACCURATELY REFLECT THE MYRIAD OF ISSUES THAT ARE MEMBERS FACE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW -- THAT IS A JACKET SAID ADDITIONALLY OUT MOST REMEMBERS DON'T HAVE RETIREE HEALTH AFTER EACH SIXTY FIVE SO WHEN THE REPLACEMENT RATIO WHICH IS THE THAT TOTAL DOLLARS THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE GETTING FOR THEIR CAL STIRS BENEFIT OVERALL. MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO COVER THE TOTAL COSTS IF THEY'RE GONNA HAVE AS A RETIREE AND COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT THEY'RE LIVING LONGER WHICH MEANS IF THEY'RE CAL STIRS BENEFIT. IS THE PRIMARY MECHANISM THAT'S GOING TO BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING A SECURE RETIREMENT FUTURE AND LIVING IN POVERTY. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OUR MEMBERS SINCE THEY'RE PRIMARILY WOMEN HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY A LOWER AMOUNT OF SERVICE CREDIT THAN THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS BECAUSE CHILDREN. TO CARE FOR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. ALL OF THIS HELPS THE PAIN TO REAP A PICTURE SPECIALLY NOTING THAT OUR MEMBERS DON'T GET SOCIAL SECURITY AND WE'VE MADE IT A POINT AS A STATE FOR A FEW DECADES NOW TO RECRUIT EDUCATORS AS A SECOND CAREER. TO BRING PEOPLE IN TO TEACH MATH SCIENCE A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES WITHOUT HELPING THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S WAY OF THINKING THEM IS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY PAID INTO. TO THEIR OTHER CAREER SO THIS APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT THAT GOVERNOR NEW SIM CONTINUES TO BELIEVE RETIREMENT SECURITY IS IMPORTANT MORE APPRECIATIVE OF THE RESOURCES THAT HE'S PROVIDING THAT CERTAINLY GOING TO BE HELPFUL FOR OUR MEMBERS AS WELL AS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT RETIREMENT SECURITY IS THE KEY BECAUSE FOR OUR MEMBERS THAT'S GOING TO BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND POVERTY WE ALSO NEED TO NOTE THAT EDUCATION IS REALLY TAKEN A SIGNIFICANT HITS. SO DURING THE RECESSION -- PROP NINETY EIGHT HAD SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ELIMINATED -- ESSENTIALLY FUNDS THAT WERE REDUCE DURING THE RECESSION THAT WE DID NOT GET PAID BACK FOR AS OTHER ENTITIES WHEN THEY HAD MONEY THAT WAS I USE. THEY RECEIVE THOSE MONIES BACK WITH INTEREST EDUCATION DIDN'T SEE THAT WHICH MEANS THAT THE RECESSION LEFTA WHOLE GENERATION OF OUR MEMBERS HAVING FURLOUGHS. HAVE BEEN STALLED IN FLAT SALARY RATES FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF HOT SPOTS AROUND THE TWO ON AROUND THE STATE. YOU THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE NOW SAYING YOU KNOW IT'S TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE -- AN ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR EDUCATION WERE NOT EVEN PROVIDING THAT SO THAT ALSO REFLECTS INTO THE SALARIES THAT OUR MEMBERS MAKE WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO HAVE A LONG TERM IMPACT. ON THE TOTAL PENSION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECIEVE SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU AS REFLECTING UPON THE KIND OF LEGISLATION THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT INTRODUCED SEEN OR THAT YOU'RE WANT GOING TO WANT TO RESPOND TO OVER THIS NEXT TWO YEAR SESSION. TO THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE BUT THE LONG TERM RETIREMENT SECURITY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE MEMBERS DO A LOT FOR KIDS AROUND THE SIX POINT TWO MILLION KIDS IN THE STATE THERE OFTEN PARENTS CARE GIVERS. THERE LITERALLY HEROES REST GREEN STUDENTS SUCH AS SAYING. IN PARADISE -- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA TREATS THEM THE WAY THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED NOT ONLY NOW BUT EVEN WHEN THEY TURN HUNDRED WHICH MORE OF REALLY ARE DOING. SO WE ASK YOU TO BE CONSIDERATE IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU'RE HAVING -- BOTH NOW AND IN THE FUTURE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU'RE MAKING DECISIONS THAT ARE GOING TO COST THE SYSTEMS MONEY. THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ASK OUR MEMBERS TO PAY FOR IT WE'RE ASKING THAT YOU MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE PAYS FOR THE PROMISES THAT THE STATE KIDS. NOT BECAUSE OUR MEMBERS ARE PAYING MORE FOR CAL STIRS AS PART OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE AND R. PEPPER MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY PAYING MORE AND GETTING LESS SO. WE ENCOURAGE I CONTINUED CONVERSATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING OVER THE NEXT TO YOU THANK YOU MISS BAKER. STREET THE COMMENTS MISTER LOW. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN HELEN CHAIRMAN RODRIGUEZ -- SINCE I'M THE LAST SPEAKER I WILL OPEN BY NOTING THAT I DID TIME MIKE REMARKS AT IT FOR MINUTES ONLY -- MY NAME IS DAVE LOW AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE CSEA REPRESENTS -- OVER TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES IN K. TWELVE AND COMMITTEE COLLEGES THEY ARE THE LOWEST WAGE WORKERS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. CRS REPRESENTS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PUBLIC EMPLOYEES INCLUDING TEACHERS NURSES FIREFIGHTERS POLICE CLASSIFIED STATE AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES. AS THE C. R. S. CHAIR MY PRIMARY DUTY OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAS BEEN. TO COUNTER THE EXAGGERATIONS AND DISTORTIONS AND OFTEN OUT LIGHT OUT RIGHT LIES OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING TO TAKE OUR PENSIONS AWAY. RETIREMENT SECURITY OPPONENTS OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE LESS THAN PENSIONS THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO PUT IN THE PRESS. THE REALITY IS THAT THE AVERAGE PENSION FOR CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES IS SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS A MONTH AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF SERVICE. AND THE AVERAGE PENSION FOR ALL CALPERS RETIREES IS TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS AFTER TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF SERVICE. TEACHERS POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS AS HAS BEEN NOTED DON'T RECEIVE SO SECURITY. SO RETIREMENT SECURITY OPPONENTS HAVE BEEN ALSO WARNING FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THAT THERE'S A PENSION CRISIS DUE TO UNFUNDED LIABILITIES HE TALKED ABOUT THAT TODAY. THE REALITY IS IS THAT UNFUNDED LIABILITIES OF ALWAYS FLUCTUATED OVER THE PAST SEVENTY FIVE YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS WHERE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN FAR WORSE. AND FAR BETTER THAN TODAY. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PENSION FUNDS WERE UNDER 50% FUNDED AND IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS PENSIONS WERE OVER 1100% FUNDED AS WAS NOTED SUPER FUNDED. IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS MOST PENSIONS WERE OVER A 100% FUNDED. AND THE LOWER FUNDED STATUS TODAY IS NOT THE FAULT OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AND BENEFITS IT WAS CAUSED BY WALL STREET REAL ESTATE ABUSES WHICH WOULD TO WEAR THAT DEREGULATE DERIVATIVES TRIGGERED -- THE THE GREAT RECESSION STILL THE DOOMSDAY PREDICTIONS OF THE ANTI PENSION ZEALOTS OF THAT THEY'VE MADE YEAR AFTER YEAR FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAVE NOT COME TRUE. SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION UNFUNDED LIVE 580% WHICH IS FAR ABOVE THE LEVELS OF FUNDED STATUS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EARLIER AND IN ADDITION THE PERCENTAGE OF THE STATE BUDGET DEDICATED TO PENSIONS. HAS ACTUALLY GONE DOWN IT'S LOWER TODAY THAN IT HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST DECADE. SO THE RETIREMENT SECURITY OPPONENTS THEN TELL US THAT THE SOLUTION IS TO ELIMINATE DOUBT DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS AND PUT EVERYBODY IN A RISKY FOR ONE CASE DOUBT PLAN. WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU IS THAT FOR ONE K. PLANS WERE NEVER INTENDED AS A REPLACEMENT FOR PENSIONS THEY WERE CONCEIVED BY A MAN NAMED TED BENNETT AND? NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE TED BENNETT WAS A CONSULTANT FOR THE JOHNSON COMPANY HIS CLIENT WAS A BANK PRESIDENT WHO WANTED TO REPLACE HIS CASH BONUS PLAN WITH THE DEFERRED RETIREMENT ACCOUNT. BENNETT DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND A LOOPHOLE IN THE IRS CODE FOUR OH ONE K.. AND THAT ALLOWED THAT BANK PRESIDENT TO DEFERRED HIS BONUSES ON IT IN A TAX DEFERRED INCOME BASIS SINCE THAT TIME MANY EMPLOYERS AND INSTEAD ELIMINATED PENSIONS AND SWITCHED A FOUR ONE K. PLANS. THIS CHANGE HAS BEEN FINANCIALLY DEVASTATING FOR ALL BUT THE MOST HIGHLY PAID WORKERS PRIMARILY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTED THAT THE AVERAGE WORKER WITH A FOUR ONE K. RETIRES WITH ONLY ENOUGH SAVINGS TO LAST 25% INTO THEIR RETIREMENT. MANY OF THESE ARE BABY BOOMERS WHO WILL RETIRE AND END UP ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE OR MOVING IN WITH THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING FORCED TO GO BACK TO WORK DURING THEIR GOLDEN YEARS. EVEN BENNETT HAS SINCE BEEN QUOTED AS STATING THAT HE REGRETS CREATING THE FOUR ONE K. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN APPLIED IN A MATTER THE BENEFITS WALL STREET AND HURTS WORKERS. IN SAN JOSE FORMER MAYOR CHUCK REED ELIMINATED PENSIONS FOR POLICE CENTERS THEY COULD NOT RETAIN A RECRUIT POLICE AS THEY LEFT IN DROVES AND CRIME SKYROCKETED THE NEW MAYOR HAS SINCE NEGOTIATED A NEW DEAL TO RESTORE PENSIONS. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY AND SAID FIREFIGHTERS WITH THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE AND PLACES LIKE PARADISE. AND IN THE SAME BREATH PROPOSED TAKING AWAY THEIR PENSIONS AND REPLACING THEM WITH FOUR ONE K. PLANS. THESE ARE THE WORST TYPE OF HYPOCRISIES THE FACT IS PENSIONS AND ARE ARE AN IMPORTANT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL THEY ALSO INJECT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO LOCAL ECONOMIES BECAUSE RETIREE SPEND THEIR MONEY. ON FOOD AND HOUSING AND CLOTHING AND NOT ON PUBLIC AS AND THEY'RE NOT ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTE FROM THEIR OWN PAYCHECK TO PAY A SHARE THEIR PENSIONS. THEY OFTEN WORK AND DANGEROUS LIFE THREATENING JOBS AND MANY OF THE MAKE LESS THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY WORK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR A HANDOUT. THEY'RE JUST ASKING FOR A FAIR SHAKE SO FOR FORMS ARE NEEDED WE'RE WILLING TO DISCUSS THEM AND WE HAVE BEEN. UNIONS HAVE NEGOTIATED OVER THREE HUNDRED CONTRACTS STATEWIDE THAT HAVE ALREADY REDUCED PENSIONS FOR NEW EMPLOYEES OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT THE EMPLOYEES PAY TO KEEP THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THEIR PENSIONS. EVERY DAY AN EMPLOYEE WHO DEDICATED HIS OR HER CAREER STE TO SERVICING OUR STATE TEACHING OUR STUDENTS SAVING LIVES ARE KEEPING OUR AIR AND WATER SAFE DRIVING OUR KIDS TO AND FROM SCHOOL. THEY RETIRE WITH A MODEST PENSION AND THEIR STORIES NEVER WRITTEN ABOUT IN THE PAPERS OR TOLD IN THE FIVE O'CLOCK NEWS. YET THE LESS THAN 1% OF PENSION ABUSES USUALLY BY HIGH PAID MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES SEEMS TO ALWAYS GET FRONT PAGE EVERY DAY IN THE B. AND EVERY NEWSPAPER. COVERED BY ALL THE NEWSPAPERS THE FACT IS THE MAJORITY OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THEY LOVE THEIR JOBS THEY PUT IT THERE FOR A FAIR DAY'S WORK. AND ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS RETIRE WITH DIGNITY SO WE URGE YOU NOT TO ALLOW THE DAVID CRANES AND CAR THE MILES AND CHUCK READS. TO DISTORT THE FACTS AND DESTROY THE DREAM OF A FAIR PENSION INSTEAD WE ASK YOUR TO COMMITTEES TO PROTECT AND ENHANCE THE GOAL OF RETIREMENT SECURITY THANK YOU.
