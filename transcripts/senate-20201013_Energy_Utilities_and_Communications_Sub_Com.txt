SO TODAY WE CONVENE THIS HEARING TO BOTH LOOK BACK AND TO LOOK FORWARD. A LITTLE OVER A MONTH AGO MARKET DECADE SINCE A NATURAL GAS PIPELINE EXPLODED IN THE CHRIS MORE NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAN BRUNO. THAT EVENT TOOK THE LIVES OF EIGHT OF MY CONSTITUENTS GREATLY IMPACTED THE COURSE OF MY LEGISLATIVE WORK AND AFFECTED EVERYONE HERE TODAY. I HOPE OUR DISCUSSION CAN BE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE'VE LEARNED AND THE PROGRESS THE STATE HAS MADE SINCE. THE SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION. AS WELL AS WHAT MORE WE NEED TO DO WHERE THE GAPS ARE AND HOW WE CAN EFFECTIVELY FILL THEM. GUEST SAFETY INCIDENTS PURCHASED. THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LEAK AT THE ALISO CANYON STORAGE FACILITY. IN THE MAY TWENTY NINETEEN ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT RAISED CONCERNS OVER THE SAFETY PRACTICES AT SO CAL GAS. LEASES OPERATOR. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EXPLOSION. ON SO CAL GAS LINE TO CAUSE FURTHER CONSTRAINT TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL GAS SUPPLY ONLY HEIGHTENED THOSE CONCERNS. AND THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN INVESTIGATIONS INTO P. GENIES LOCATE AND MARK PROGRAM WHERE YEARS OF MANAGERIAL PRESSURE AND PROBLEMATIC FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. LEAD TO DISTORTIONS AND FALSIFICATION IN REPORTING. AND THIS IS JUST THE GAS SIDE. FIFTY TOUCHES ALL ASPECTS OF UTILITIES ENTERPRISE LESSONS LEARNED IN ONE SECTOR SHOULD BE CARRIED INTO THE OTHER SECTORS. WE'VE INVITED TO PANELS OF EXPERTS TODAY TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES BOTH WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST. AND HOW THESE LESSONS SHOULD INFORM FUTURE DECISION MAKING. NOW I'D LIKE TO TURN TO THE MEMBERS WHO ARE ONLINE WHO MAY HAVE OPENING STATEMENTS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. THANK SENATOR. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING SENATOR SHARE WELCOME THANK YOU. ARE YOU HAVE A VERY BRIEF OPENING REMARK WHICH IS JUST TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR YOUR CONTINUED VIGILANCE OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR CAREER EVEN INTO THIS FINAL FINAL CHUNK OF THE HOME STRETCH AND I JUST WANT TO. I PLEDGE MY CONTINUED VIGILANCE ON YOUR BEHALF TO SEE THIS CHANGE IN SAFETY CULTURE NOT JUST AT OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BUT AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THROUGH- IN YOUR ABSENCE BUT SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR DILIGENCE NOT JUST ON PEOPLE BUT YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT IN SAN BRUNO IN THE BAY AREA BUT FOR EVERYONE DOWN HERE IN OUTHERN CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS AND RESIDENTS ALIKE- IT'S A- IT'S A- TRUE. SENATE PUBLIC SERVICE YOU'VE DONE HERE TODAY AND I- I LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING FOR THE PANELS. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION TO. THE ISSUES THAT- ARE RELATED TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE ESPECIALLY GAS IS OBVIOUSLY YOU SUFFERED IN YOUR DISTRICT SUFFERED CONSIDERABLY DURING THE EARLY SHOW CANYON. OF CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS IN THAT- HORRENDOUSLY COME A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SO THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITMENT FOR THE FUTURE ALBIA. I'LL BE WATCHING CAREFULLY ON THAT ONE- OF THE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE IT'S A IS WISHING TO SPEAK I SEE NO ONE AT THIS POINT VERY GOOD. C. O. M. SO I WOULD NOW LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE- MAYOR RICO MEDINA THE FROM THE CITY OF SAN BRUNO TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT- MAYOR MEDINA THIS IS A LONG TIME PUBLIC SERVANT HE'S A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE A FRIEND OF THE CITY OF SAN BRUNO AND- SOMEONE WHOSE LEADERSHIP REALLY EXCELLED DURING THE- THE TRAGEDY OF TEN YEARS AGO AND NOT JUST WITH DURING THAT. BRIEF MOMENT IN TIME WHEN WE SAW AND WITNESSED AND EXPERIENCED THE EXPLOSION BEFORE THE YEARS AFTER IN HIS FIGHT IN THE CITY'S FIGHT THAT HE LED ALONG WITH THE CURRENT MAYOR ROAD HE WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER AT THE TIME BUT THAT FLIGHT THEY TOOK TO THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO AGAINST THE P. UC AND ALSO IN THE COURTS OF LAW AGAINST THE PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY SO MAYOR REGINA MEDINA THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND WE WELCOME YOU HERE TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR. MISTER CHAIR FOR STATE I WANT TO FIRST PERSONALLY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY IN THE COUNCIL THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND BEING A FRIEND TO THE CITY OF SAN BRUNO. OUT YOUR TENURE IN THE SENATE. YOU HAVE TRULY BEEN A- PERSON THAT WE CAN CALL ON. WE CAN LEAN ON. AND WE CAN GET ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE AND I'M HAPPY TO HEAR SENATOR STERN. OFFER HIS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE THIS BOARD AS YOU APART. FROM THE CAPITAL. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. ON LOOKING BACK TO SEPTEMBER THE NINTH TWO THOUSAND AND TEN BUT SIX ELEVEN. TWENTY NEED CHAMBER EVENT WITH THE MAYOR WAYNE FORMER MERRILL WAYNE AND MYSELF AS VICE MAYOR. WE HAD A PHONE CALL OF AN EXPLOSION. WHICH WAS NOW KNOWN AS OUR LINE ONE THIRTY TWO AT THIRTY INCH GAS LINE THAT EXPLODED LITERALLY. IN FLAMES WERE BORROWING OUT OF THE GROUND. UPON ARRIVING WITHIN TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES OF THAT TO WITNESS THE FLAMES IN THE FURY. I FEEL THE HEAT AND WATCH FOLKS RUNNING EVACUATING. I'M TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF WHAT JUST TRANSPIRED IT IS TRUE WHEN REPORTS WERE THAT MANY FOLKS THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRPLANE THAT HAD DESCENDED AND CRASHED BUT THEN REALIZE WHEN THE FUEL OF THE FIRE CONTINUED ON. NINETY PLUS MINUTES BECAUSE WE'RE NO SHUT OFF VALVES WE HAD TO GET PEOPLE IN THERE DURING COMMUTE TIME AGAIN IT WAS SIX ELEVEN. KEEP IN MIND THIS AND TRANSPIRED AT MIDNIGHT ONE AM TWO AM. THE LAWSUIT WE COULD HAVE SUFFERED AT THAT POINT. BUT WE DID STUFF. WE HAD A FATALITIES. SIXTY SIX RESIDENTS WERE INJURED. THIRTY EIGHT HOMES TOTALLY DESTROYED SEVENTEEN HOMES EVERELY DAMAGED. AND THE COMMUNITY HONESTLY THE DRAMA. OUR CITY THROUGH THIS DEVASTATION THE RESILIENCE AND COURAGE OF THIS COMMUNITY AND A FORWARD THINKING ABOUT COUNCIL WANTED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. WE WANTED TO AS LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES CAME IN TO INVESTIGATE FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED HAS REPEAL THE WAY THE YOUNG AND WE FOUND A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED AND TRANSPIRED. BUT OF OUR OBJECTIVES BACK THEN WHICH INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION. ACTON REBEKAH REMEDIATE NEGLIGENT CONDUCT AND PRACTICES PENALIZED APPROPRIATELY IN SHORT SYSTEM SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AND REFORM A BROKEN PIPELINE REGULATORY SYSTEM AND THROUGH OUR EFFORTS AND OUT OF THE SUPPORT OF OTHERS IT WAS CLEARLY SHOWN. AND DOCUMENTS. IT WAS A COZY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ENGINEERING ON THE PC. AND THAT DID NOT HELP. TRANSPIRED HERE IN THE CITY OF SAN BRUNO. WE WENT FORWARD AND WANTED TO CONTINUE TO SEE AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN NOT ONLY IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT ANY COMMUNITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO US THAN IT IS NOW. THOSE OF OSTERWEIS DOES IT STILL WEAR. THE SCARS IN THE EMOTIONS. THAT THEY STILL SUFFER WITH TODAY. SOMETHING HAS TO COME OUT OF THIS THAT IMPROVES US GOING FORWARD AS A STATE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS DIVERSITY A LOT OF TIME A LOT OF EFFORT TO GET OFF TRACK. BUT IT WAS IMPORTANT AS WE PURSUED THE TRUTH WE DID SU THE REQUESTED RECORDS AND RECEIVED EMAILS THAT SHOW TRULY WHAT WAS HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES. AND THEN IN THE END BUT WE WANT TO DO YOUR WHICH CREATING SAFER UTILITY IN. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE LACK OF SAFETY THE LACK OF RECORDS THE DIVERSION OF MONEY. ARE ALL VERY APPARENT EVIDENCE. AS HE ENTERED S. B. DID THEIR INVESTIGATION WHICH I DID FLY BACK TWICE FOR THE WEEK OF HEARING AS WELL AS THEIR FINDINGS MADE A VERY CLEAR. IT WAS NEGLECT ON P. JEANNIE AND VERY UNCOMMON THAT THE NTSB DECIDED TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE REPORT USUALLY IS ALWAYS THE CITY IT CHANGES THE SAY THE PG&amp;E PIPELINE EXPLOSION RARELY DONE BUT WANTED TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE. ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIXTH TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE NTSB RELEASED INVESTIGATION REPORT. THE TERM. AT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS DETAINEES IN ADEQUATE QUALITY CONTROL. THE ORIGINAL INSTALLATION OF THE PIPES. GENIE'S BEEN ADEQUATE PIPELINE INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WHICH FAILED TO DETECT AND REPAIR THE DEFECTIVE HEIGHTS SECTION. NBG USING DETAINEES AN ADEQUATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE WHICH CAUSED UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND INCREASED DAMAGE THE NTSB ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE P. UC FAILED TO DETECT THE INADEQUACIES INDIGENES INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. IN THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION NEEDED TO INCORPORATE MORE MEANINGFUL METRICS INTO ITS PIPELINE SAFETY GUIDANCE AND IMPROVE ITS OVERSEAS OVERSEAS SITE ON THE STATE OF UTILITIES COMMISSION. WHAT THAT TELLS ME IS THIS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. WE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THE LOSS OF LIFE. THE INJURED THE DEVASTATION OF A NEIGHBORHOOD TRYING TO REBUILD IT LITERALLY. HAS TAKEN US ALMOST A DECADE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT ONE IS ELECTED COMES INTO OFFICE AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T STUDY FOR YOU CAN'T READ A BOOK ON. AND ALL THOSE FIRE AND POLICE PERSONNEL THAT RESPONDED THAT NIGHT AND SUBSEQUENT TO ASSIST OUR CITY WE ARE TRULY GRATEFUL FOR MUTUAL AID. WAS SUPERIOR. OUR ELECTED STE WHO STEP FORWARD YOU MISTER CHAIR AND OTHERS THAT REPRESENT THIS STATE IN THE CITY STEP FORWARD TO ASSIST US. IN TO TRY TO RIGHT A WRONG I KNOW THAT DURING THE- AND YOUR REMEMBER INSTEAD CAME UP THE GENIE DID SEND MYSELF IN THE COUNCIL LETTER ACKNOWLEDGING UNDERSTANDING. BUT ALSO TO THE HELP OF YOU ENJOY EVERYBODY THEY HAVE STATED THAT THEY PLEADED THE SAFETY WORK SET FORTH IN THE PIPELINE SAFETY ENHANCEMENT PLAN BUT THE INSTALLED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE REMOTE CONTROLLED AN AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF VALVES ON OUR TRANSMISSION PIPELINES. REPLACING NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILES OF IT GAS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE IN OVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILES OF BASS DISTRIBUTION. PIPELINE AND ARE COMPLETING. THE LEVEL OF THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETED IN COMPLETING THE TWELFTH ELEVEN OF THE TWELVE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY IN TEN YEARS BUT FOR OUR COMMUNITY OF THE CITY OF SAN BRUNO. IT HAS NOT FORGOTTEN AS WE HAD TO COVER NINE TO TEN YEARS IN WITH BOTH OF IT. WHICH MAKES IT OBVIOUSLY VERY CHALLENGING TO OTHER. DETERMINED THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A KIOSK. AT A DEDICATED PARK. WHERE THERE ARE FIVE BENCHES WITH THE NAMES OF THOSE THAT WE LOST. INDIVIDUALLY AND WITH THEIR FAMILIES. WE HAVE A KEY AUSTIN IT IS ON OUR WEBSITE AND IT'S A VIRTUAL BUT YOU CAN GO THROUGH TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY. THANK YOU ALSO BE REMOVED AND WILL BE PLACED IN OUR NEW RECORD PARK CENTER. IN OUR CITY PARK SO THAT WE WILL NEVER FORGET. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DO MOVE FORWARD BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE ERRORS OF THE PAST. THAT WE CORRECT THEM. FOR ALL TIMES TO COME. NO ONE. NO ONE. ANY COMMUNITY. SHOULD FACED WHAT WE FACED. INTOLERABLE WE ENCOUNTERED SHE LATER REST GOING TO ALL THOSE SERVICES I WOULD JUST LIKE TO AGAIN MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE I WANT TO THANK YOU SIR FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE FOR THIS CONCERT AND THE COMMITTEE THAT HAD THAT YOU HAVE LEAD TO AND HOW YOU HAVE HELPED US AS A COMMUNITY YOU HAVE SERVED US WELL SIR AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND AS I CONCLUDE I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE OF GREAT BULLIS. MOVEON BONELESS. WILLIAM BONELESS. JAMES FRANCO. YES SIR GREG JACQUELINE CRAIG JESSICA MORALIS AND ELIZABETH TAURUS. THE CITY OF SAN BRUNO SHALL NEVER FORGET THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MR MAYOR AND THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP- THAT HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY- NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR FIRST PRESENTER AND THAT WOULD BE- ROBERT HALL DIRECTOR OF OFFICE. OF RAILROAD PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INVESTIGATIONS AT THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD- MISTER HALL THANK YOU AND WELCOME. GERMANTOWN MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. I WAS ONE OF THE INVESTIGATORS RESPONDING TO THE SAME BROWN DESTINATION I'M CURRENTLY THE DIRECTOR OF OUR OFFICE OF RAILROADS PIPELINES AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INVESTIGATIONS. THE ACCIDENT IN SEPTEMBER NOW WAS A HORRIFIC AND TRAGIC EVENT IT SPARKED DISTRUST DISCUSSIONS AND COMPELLED ACTIONS BY OPERATORS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO MINIMIZE THE SAFETY RISKS THAN UNDERGROUND PIPELINES PRESENT. AND IT CONTINUES TO INFLUENCE HOW WE SEEK TO IMPROVE PIPELINE SAFETY TODAY TEN YEARS LATER. PIPELINES ARE ONE OF THE SAFEST MOT EFFICIENT MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION BUT WHEN SAFETY STANDARDS ARE INADEQUATE- DISREGARDED OR WHEN FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES FAILED TO CONDUCT PROPER OVERSIGHT OF A PIPELINE OPERATOR THE CONSEQUENCES CAN BE DEVASTATING. IN SEPTEMBER NOW IT TOOK PG&amp;E NINETY FIVE MINUTES TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS SEVERELY HINDERING THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. THE NTSB HAS BEEN STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF THE LIGHT AND SHUTTING DOWN FAILED PIPELINE SYSTEMS SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY WE'VE ISSUED RECOMMENDATION AFTER RECOMMENDATION TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS INCLUDING OUR RECOMMENDATION OUT OF SAN BRUNO TO REQUIRE THE USE OF AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF. OR REMOTE CONTROL VALVES IN HIGH CONSEQUENCE AREAS. EVEN THOUGH THE U. S. CONGRESS MANDATED IMPLEMENTING THIS RECOMMENDATION IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE FEDERAL REGULATOR THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION OR FEMSA HAS YET TO COMPLETE THEIR WORK ON THIS MANDATE. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT PG&amp;E RECORDS WERE INCOMPLETE AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHED MAXIMUM OPERATING PRESSURES. WE SHOULD TO URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO PG&amp;E AND THEY TOOK THEM SATISFACTORY ACTIONS TO CLOSE THEM. EVEN THOUGH THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE DIRECTED TO ONE OPERATOR OTHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TOOK HEED AND CONDUCTED REVIEWS OF THEIR OWN SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT A SIMILAR ACCIDENT DID NOT OCCUR IN THEIR PIPELINES. THE SIDE SAN BRUNO WE'VE INVESTIGATED ADDITIONAL TRAN. TRANSMISSION PIPELINE ACCIDENTS WHERE DEFICIENCIES WHAT THE OPERATORS INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AND FILMS ARE OVERSIGHT WERE CONCERNED. TO ENHANCE THESE PROGRAMS WE RECOMMENDED ELIMINATING THE SOLE USE OF DIRECT ASSESSMENT WHICH IS LIMITED. IN DISCOVERING ANOMALIES. FANS I HAS SATISFACTORILY ADDRESSED THIS RECOMMENDATION. I'M NOT GONNA HALF THE SAN BRUNO MASS A MASSIVE OIL SPILL FROM A PIPELINE OCCURRED IN MARSHALL MICHIGAN. THIS ACCIDENT ALSO INVOLVED ERRORS IN PIPELINE INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT. AND CONTROL CENTER OPERATIONS THERE WERE AVOIDABLE DELAYS IN IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO THE RUPTURE EXACERBATING THE CONSEQUENCES. BUILDING ON WHAT WE LEARNED IN SAN BRUNO AND OTHER ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS IN R. MARSHALL REPORT THE NTSB RECOMMENDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SPECIFIC TO THE PIPELINE INDUSTRY. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE ISSUED SMS STANDARDS TO ASSIST PIPELINE OPERATORS. WHICH ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED AND IMPROVING SAFETY. EIGHT YEARS AFTER SAN BRUNO A SERIES OF STRUCTURE FIRES AND EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED AFTER THE OVER PRESSURIZATION OF A NATURAL GAS SYSTEM AND MERRIMACK VALLEY MASSACHUSETTS. DECIDES SEVERAL LONG STANDING ISSUES THAT WE HAVE SEEN A PIPELINE ACCIDENTS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE WAS THE LACK OF A REQUIREMENT FOR A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER APPROVAL OF NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS PROJECTS IN MASSACHUSETTS. A PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER STAMP ON ENGINEERING DRAWINGS ASSURES THE PUBLIC OF THEIR SAFETY AND IS A REQUIREMENT THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. YOU WOULD THINK THAT THIS APPLIES TO THE NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL HOWEVER AT THE TIME OF OUR INVESTIGATION THIRTY ONE STATES EXEMPTED PUBLIC UTILITIES FROM THIS REQUIREMENT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THEM AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE RECOMMENDED. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A MAN THEIR STATUTE TO ENSURE THAT ALL FUTURE NATURAL GAS PROJECTS REQUIRE A P. EASE APPROVAL. CURRENTLY WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR A RESPONSE FROM THE STATE. THE ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO THE SAN BRUNO PIPELINE RUPTURE HAVE IMPROVED SAFETY BUT THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE OUR INVESTIGATIONS HAVE FOUND THAT THE SAFE OPERATION OF PIPELINES IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. AMONG OPERATORS GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT AGENCIES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES. KRUGMAN'S THE PIPELINE SAFETY CAN TAKE YEARS OR DECADES TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE ACTION REQUIRES CONTINUING COMMITMENT AND FOLLOW THROUGH. RESHAPE YOUR DEDICATION TO THE STAFFER THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY SIGN IT ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT AT THE NTSB AND THE HARD WORK THAT YOU'VE- PROVIDED AND- PERFORMED- AT THE NTSB AND THROUGH THESE INVESTIGATIONS IT'S A ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHY. IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE SUCH CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN THE N. T. S. B. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS- WHEN WE CONCLUDE OUR FIRST PANEL AND NOW WE WILL MOVE TO- HERE FIRMA CHRISTOPHER P. ONLY A DIRECTOR PIPELINE IN UTILITIES FOR AMERICA'S ASSET ADVISORY. AND MISTER P. ONLY WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN HILL AND MEMBERS OF THE ELECTRIC GAS AND TRANSMISSION. A TRANSPORTATION SAFETY OMMITTEE WELL LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE ON SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED. FROM THE- TRAIN. STATION TRAGIC GAS. INCIDENT IN SAN BRUNO. AS YOU MENTIONED- MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER KELLY I AM A DIRECTOR AT A DIZZYING CONSULTING THE CONSULTING ARM OF WORLDLY. AT THE END WORK IN THE PAST. ADVISORY GROUP I SERVED AS ONE OF THE TECHNICAL ADVISORS TO THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL FROM JACOBS CONSULTANCY WHICH- IS NOW PART OF WORLDLY. AND I HAVE SPENT SINCE OF THAT TIME- WORKING WITH KLEIN PLAN SPY PLANE OPERATOR SO ON IN PREPARING SAFETY CASES IN BUSINESS AND BUSINESS CASES. IN ORDER TO- FUND AND IMPROVE- OPERATORS SAFETY PROGRAMS I'D LIKE TO START BY JUST AN OBSERVATION WITH REGARD TO THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL AND THE- COMMEND THE LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME AND- TO ESTABLISHING THAT THAT INDEPENDENT PANEL AND SPECIFICALLY THE MANDATE THAT THE PANEL LOOK FOR THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENTS IN OPERATIONS BUT ALSO IN MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION. AND I GUESS IN ANALOGY TO THE THEATER WORLD IS ALLOWING US TO BREAK THE FOURTH WALL AT AND UNDERSTAND THE ORGANIZATIONAL- CULTURE OF PG&amp;E BUT ALSO THE CPUC. AND I THINK THAT THE FINAL REPORT THAT WAS PRODUCED- PROVIDED CONSIDERABLE INSIGHT M. IN HIGHLIGHTING THE TWO KEY ASPECTS THAT HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BY. CAN T. S. B. AS WELL AS AS WELL AS- FEMSA IN IN RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF CORPORATE CULTURE IN IN PIPELINE SAFETY. AND SECONDLY THE RECOGNITION THAT THIS WAS AN ORGANIZATIONAL FAILURE. NOT NOT SIMPLY. A SYSTEM OPERATING FAILURE. I'D ALSO POINT OUT THAT THAT HAVING SPOKEN WITH. THE DIRECTORS AND NEW MANAGEMENT AT PG&amp;E- AS WELL AS- A FOLLOW UP WITH THE CPUC THAT THE LEADERS FELT THAT THIS REPORT PROVIDED A ROAD MAP FOR THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS AND I THINK THAT IS. APPARENT BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ONE ENDS IT'S A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS AND THEREFORE NEEDS- SUSTAINED COMMITMENT. THIS LEADS ME TO I WOULD SAY MY FIRST LESSON LEARNED M. THAT IS ONE CAN'T ALWAYS WAIT FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ACT AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED IT'S TAKEN NEARLY TEN YEARS FOR FILMS THAT TO PROMULGATE. NEW SAFETY- THE NEW SAFETY OF GAS PIPELINE REFER TO AS THE MEGA RULE AND IT'S ONLY ONE PIECE OF AND JUST A- GROUP THAT THAT. WILL REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL OTHER RULES TO FULLY. COVER WHAT THE CONGRESS HAS LEGISLATED AND THAT SPANNED FROM OUR SHOULD SAY SPAWNED FROM THE SAN BRUNO INCIDENT. CALIFORNIA'S INITIATIVE- INITIATE THEIR REFORM WITHIN A YEAR. OF THE INCIDENT AND AGAIN THAT THAT'S THE LEADERSHIP SHOWN BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO MOVE FORWARD. RATHER THAN WAIT. THE SECOND LESSON LEARNED THAT I'D LIKE TO JUST SAY IS THE THING THAT REGULATE THAT REGULATED UTILITIES LIKE LESS THAN REGULATION IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF NOT HAVING REGULATIONS. PIPELINE OPERATORS UTILITIES ARE ARE RELUCTANT TO INVEST WITHOUT- IN SAFETY WITHOUT. GUIDANCE AND AGAIN I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE- AND THE FOLLOW THROUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER SAM BRUNELLE. PROVIDED THAT IS THAT- GUIDANCE TO ENABLE- THE RESPONSE THAT CALIFORNIA SHOWED IN THE LEADERSHIP WITH REGARD TO THEIR SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. LET ME JUST BE CLEAR THAT THAT NATIONALLY PIPELINE OPERATORS AND- HAVE AND ARE INVESTING IN MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS TO PIPELINE SAFETY- THE STATE DID NOT NECESSARILY REST ON THEIR HANDS WAITING BUT FOR FEDERAL REGULATIONS. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY IN MY VIEW RETARDED THE ADVANCE THE ADVANCEMENT. FINALLY I THINK THAT THE- THAT THAT THAT AGAIN- THE LEADERSHIP OF A IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDED THE BREADTH AND DEPTH HEY NECESSARY AND THE PACE IN CALIFORNIA TO ESSENTIALLY. IT'S A COMPLETE OR WAS JUST SAY COMPLETE THE FIRST STAGE GATE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TIME THAT IT TOOK. THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS TO BE PROMULGATED SO. THE THIRD LESSON I'D LIKE TO JUST SHARE IS THAT MEANINGFUL SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENCE. TAKE PERSISTENCE LEADERSHIP IN TIME. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS OF PROGRESS IN PIPELINE SAFETY HAT HAS MADE MANY. IMPROVEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE THE IMP WITH REGARD TO RISK IN IN TWO THOUSAND TEN MOST PIPELINE OPERATORS AT RISK MODELS WERE NOTHING MORE THAN A WHAT AN ELABORATE WAY OF PRIORITIZING WHAT BASELINE ASSESSMENT NEEDS TO BE DONE. CALIFORNIA HAS HAS HAS INITIATED SEVERAL. RAM AND OTHER RISK APPROACHES THAT ENABLE- THE FORENSICS IF YOU WILL OF THE SYSTEM ALLOWING INVESTMENTS TO BE BETTER TARGETED TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE FAILURES. SECONDLY NATIONALLY THERE IS BCOME A RECOGNITION THAT SAFETY IS NOT JUST OSHA. AND IT WAS ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS THAT IT IN THE END THE INDEPENDENT ROUTE. YOU PANEL'S REPORT. THAT THE FOCUS OF THE COMPANY- IT WAS ON SAFETY OF ITS PEOPLE AND ITS ATTENTION APPROPRIATE FOCUS. BUT IT WASN'T THE RECOGNITION THAT SAFETY ALSO MEANT. THE INTEGRITY OF THE ASSETS THEMSELVES. THIRD I JUST ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT IS THIS IS THE CONCEPT OF COURT CORPORATE CULTURE AND WE'VE SEEN THAT IT'S BECOME FRONT AND CENTER- WITH THE- WITH DISCUSSIONS- YES PART OF THAT PIPELINE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS BUT I THINK IT AND THEN MY WORK IN IN WITH UTILITIES IN IN IN THE AREA OF PIPELINE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IS THE ISSUE OF TRUST. AND BY THAT I MEAN THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD TO PEOPLE WHO ARE. AT THE POINT OF THE SPEAR. AFTER FEEL TRUST. IN THEIR MANAGEMENT THEIR SUPERVISORS- IN ORDER FOR THE CULTURE OF SAFETY TO OR A PIPELINE INTEGRITY TO SPAWN. MMHM AND LASTLY THE PROGRESS WITH REGARD TO THE AMALGAMATION OF THE INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS SAFETY. AND QUALITY PROCESS IN THE. PIPELINE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM. AT ITS CORNERSTONE IS A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS AND IT THE INDUSTRY IT HAS STEPPED UP AND- IS. IMPLEMENTING THIS THE PROCESS OF APPLYING SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. BUT WE'RE REALLY AT THE INFANCY INFANCY STAGE IT-WILL TAKE TIME YEARS AND COME COMMITMENT. SISTANCE LEADERSHIP. FIVE FOUR FOR THAT TOO FORD FOR THAT SYSTEM TO TAKE ROOT AND FOSTER- THE NECESSARY CHANGE IN CORPORATE CULTURE FINALLY I'D LIKE TO JUST AND WITH THREE CAUTIONARY OBSERVATIONS. THE FIRST IS THE LOSS OF INSTITUTIONAL EXPERIENCE. IN IN REVIEWING AND WORKING WITH COMPANIES AND PIPELINE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ONE OF OUR ONE OF OUR CLIENTS HI. HELLO THIS IS THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN IN THE IN THE COMPANY OVER COMPANY LESS THAN FIVE YEARS. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED. A MAJOR INCIDENT. ARE HIDDEN IN IN THEIR CAREERS HAS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY THAT'S IT IN ONE HAND THAT'S THAT'S GOOD- FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE WE'VE MADE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS ON THE OTHER HAND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE MAINTAIN THAT INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN RESPONDING. AND THEREFORE THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR GREATER INVESTMENT IN TRAINING TECHNOLOGIES EVERYTHING FROM IMMERSION VIRTUAL REALITY TRAINING IN ORDER TO- IN ORDER TO. BE READY TO ACT IN AN EMERGENCY. THE SECOND ITEM I JUST WANT TO MENTION IS THE INSIDIOUS THIS OF LATENT FAILURES AND THEIR PERSISTENCE WE SAW THAT IN SAN BRUNO WE SAW YOU RECENTLY IN THE MERRIMACK VALLEY AND YOU SEE IT IN IN AND IT'S ALSO EVIDENT IN THE- IN THE- BOEING SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN MAX- INCIDENTS. AND IT I BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL NECESSITATE THE INSTANT IT INSTILLING OF A MINDFULNESS. PHILOSOPHY WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION. WE ARE WE ARE SUBJECT TO DISTRACTIONS MORE SO TODAY WE ARE AT OUR RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY. AND IN IT EVEN TO SCRIPTED PROCEDURES. CAN CAN REDUCE THEM THE MINDFULNESS AND FOCUS THAT'S NECESSARY IN DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES TO MITIGATE BLATANT FAILURES. AND LASTLY I JUST WANTED T POINT OUT THAT THAT RISK GOOD VERSION OF SOCIETY IS CONTINUING TO EVOLVE AND WE SEE THAT RIGHTFULLY SO WITH WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEREFORE AS WE LOOK AT RISK AT IN THE GAP IN THE INDUSTRY WE MUST TAKE THESE INTO IT ALSO INTO CONSIDERATION. IN IN MITIGATING. THE RISK AND INCREASING THE DECREASING THE UNCERTAINTY. ASSOCIATE WITH GAS TRANSMISSION THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION. WONDERFUL THANK YOU TO BE ONLY THAT WAS A VERY ENLIGHTENING AND- AND QUITE INFORMATIVE- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS- UP OUR LAST PRESENTER FOR THIS PANEL IS DR PAUL SCHULMAN- FROM THE CENTER OF CATASTROPHIC RISK RISK MANAGEMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY AND- COMMITTEE AND OUR HEARINGS AND A WE HAVE APPRECIATED HIS TREMENDOUS KNOWLEDGE. AND EXPERTISE- UPON THIS SUBJECT- NOT JUST WITH GAS SYSTEMS BUT RISK MANAGEMENT AND- AND SAFETY THROUGHOUT SO WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ADO DR SEAN WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WANT. VERY DEEPLY TO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IN YOUR ROLE AS CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT IN KEEPING SAFETY ON THE AGENDA IN THE STATE AND- I HAVE TO SAY THAT I WISH YOU WELL BUT I'M QUITE WORRIED. ABOUT THE IMPACT OF YOUR DEPARTURE ON A SYSTEM THAT I BELIEVE ALREADY. NEEDS A LOT OF ATTENTION IN AN IMPROVEMENT. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE TODAY ABOUT- BACK AND- I WANT TO. I'M GOING TO PUT MY SCREEN ON THEM I ASSUME CAN YOU SEE MY SCREEN. DID I NOT DO THAT YET WE CAN'T OKAY JUST. THIS I. THINK I FORGOT ONE ASCENTIAL ITEM. TO DO THIS. YEAH. IT'S YET. YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE SCREEN NO NOT EXACTLY. OKAY WELL MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE I HAVE DONE THIS. ANY LUCK NOW THOUGH STILL NOT SEEN HI. WHY IS THAT PLEASE JUST CHECK THIS. WHAT WE HAD SOME WORDS COMING OUT I THINK WE'VE GOT A NOW YES RECEDED OKAY AND I CAN MAKE THIS INTO FULL SLIDE SHOW. SO I HAVE BEEN RISK FOR- OVER THIRTY YEARS ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE TO MANAGE HAZARDOUS SYSTEMS WITH SAFETY AND RELIABILITY STARTING AT. A NUCLEAR POWER IN COMMERCIAL AVIATION AND BRANCHING INTO A WHOLE VARIETY OF OTHER INFRASTRUCTURES AND I'VE SPENT. A NUMBER OF YEARS IN CALIFORNIA LOOKING AT- THE GAS AND ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURES TELECOMS. LEVEES WATER RESOURCES AND WATER SUPPLY MARINE TRANSPORT AND- I'VE SPENT TIME IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF INFRASTRUCTURE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING P. JEANNIE GAS AND PG&amp;E ELECTRIC AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES LIKE THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION. AND THE- CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND SELL EITHER OVER THOSE YEARS FORMED A KIND OF PERSPECTIVE ON OUR SAFETY PROMOTION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS A SYSTEM. I THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THOSE- FINDINGS AND PERSPECTIVES AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF INTERVIEWING AND TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE BOTTOM. SO CERTAINLY MY PERSPECTIVE STARTS WITH THIS PREMISE THAT FORMED OVER THE YEARS. WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THESE YEARS AND CERTAINLY SINCE THE SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION BEEN CONDUCTING A NATURAL A NATURAL EXPERIENCE IN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY. A SENSE IT IS A NATURAL EXPERIMENT IN PRACTICE AND THAT EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON A QUESTION AND SEEKING AN ANSWER IN A SENSE TO A QUESTION WHAT LEVEL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY. CAN BE ACHIEVED THE LINE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON RETROSPECTIVE FINES AND PUNISHMENTS IN SAFETY. FOR ACCIDENTS ON THE PART OF UTILITIES THAT OWN AND MANAGE THE INFRASTRUCTURES. I THINK OVER THE YEARS WE NOW HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO FORM A CONCLUSION ABOUT THIS QUESTION OF THE LEVEL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY. AND THAT ANSWER IS IT IS NOT ENOUGH AS A LEVEL OF SAFETY TO APPROX APPROPRIATELY SAFEGUARD THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SOME FOLKS BACK UP I WANT TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THINK TO BE. AS WHAT I'VE EXPERIENCED IT. THE FEATURES OF THE CURRENT- CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. FIRST IT'S THE SYSTEM IS CHARACTERIZED BY ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE REGULATED UTILITIES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE STATE LEGISLATURE MEDIA AND ADVOCACY GROUPS. RETROSPECTIVE X. AFTER ACCIDENT BLAME SEEKING AND CONDEMNATION DOMINATES THE SYSTEM I BELIEVE AS OPPOSED TO THE PROMOTION OF SAFETY AS A PROSPECTIVE INTER ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH BASED AND POTENTIALLY COOPERATIVE PROCESS. OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SAFETY. REGULATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE THEY DO HAVE COOPERATIVE JOINT RESEARCH PROJECTS WE EVEN SEE THIS IN THE FEDERAL SAFETY AGENCIES LIKE THE FAA FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS HAD JOINT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE COMMERCIAL AVIATION SAFETY- BUT THIS SYSTEM BASICALLY MAKES THAT VERY DIFFICULT. AND IN FACT THE REGULATORY AGENCIES THEMSELVES THE PIERCING DOESN'T REALLY DO ANY IN HOUSE REGULATION AND IS INVOLVED IN JOINT RESEARCH. PROJECTS WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURES WITH OTHER EXPERTS WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. CAREFUL FORWARD LOOKING APPROACHES TO UTILITY SAFETY ARE OVERWHELMED BY SEARCH FOR FAST RESOLUTIONS AND SOLUTIONS TO INCIDENTS AND ACCIDENTS WE ARE SO EXCITED DRIVEN. AND THE PRESS FOR A SOLUTION OR RESOLUTION IS SO POWERFUL THAT IN UTILITY MANAGEMENT PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A FIX IF THEY CAN FIND IT AS FAST AS THEY CAN. IN LAW WE SOMETIMES MAKE RULES OR LAWS TO ADDRESS A PARTICULAR FEATURE OF AN ACCIDENT AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT WHETHER THOSE LAWS WILL BE EFFECTIVE WHETHER THEY CAN ACTUALLY GAIN COMPLIANCE. WHETHER IT'S WITHIN THE CAPABILITY OF THE REGULATORY AGENCY AGENCY TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE THOSE LOS. IN THE SEARCH FOR THESE SOLUTIONS AND BLAME. COULD LOCATE BLAME AND TO MAKE CORRECTIONS WE ARE ALSO FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON LOCAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS RATHER THAN ON LONGER TERM SYSTEMIC OR ROOT CAUSES I KNOW THAT THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL. DID TRY TO LOOK AT ROUTE COST GROUP CLASSES BUT OFTEN TIMES WE DON'T IN VARIOUS- PROCEEDINGS. HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THATNOR DO WE APPLY THE RESEARCH FRAMEWORK THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DO IT EFFECTIVELY. SO ALL OF THIS MEANS IN MY VIEW THAT THE SAFETY FOCUS IN. UTILITY MANAGEMENT IN REGULATION AND EVEN IN LAW RUNS UNFORTUNATELY ONE ACCIDENT AT LEAST OR INCIDENT BEHIND CURRENT CONDITIONS CHALLENGES AND OPERATIONS IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. ANOTHER WAY TO PUT THIS IS. THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM AND WE SHOULD THINK OF IT AS A SYSTEM AND NOT JUST LOOK AT YOU OF. ORGANIZATIONS AGENCIES FOUR PIECES OF IT. THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM IS PRODUCING FAR LESS SAFETY PROMOTION AND EFFECTIVE REGULATION THAT THE LEVEL OF DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT OF ITS PARTICIPANTS. AND I HAVE SEEN THIS IN MY WORK WITHIN THE INFRASTRUCTURES I HAVE INTERVIEWED PEOPLE AT ALL LEVELS AND ACROSS DEPARTMENTS AND I'VE SEEN IT ALSO IN THE TIME I'VE SPENT IN THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION AS WELL IN LOOKING AT THEIR OPERATIONS. MANY OF THESE PARTICIPANTS IN THE UTILITIES THE PC AND THE LEGISLATURE ARE DEEPLY FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY SHOULD BE ACHIEVING BETTER RESULTS THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE BETTER RESULTS THEY ARE. ARE CONSTRAINED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THOSE RESULTS I THINK IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUE OF SAFETY THE LARGER THIS IS A LARGER FAILURE OF THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM. TO UTILIZE. HUMAN CAPACITY. THE SYSTEM WASTE HUMAN CAPACITY. AND I HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF SPECIFIC DEFICIENCIES I COULD IDENTIFY I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO THAT NOW BUT IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS I HAVE ADDITIONAL SLIDES THAT MIGHT ADDRESS SOME OF THESE PARTICULAR DEFICIENCIES IN SAFETY MANAGEMENT RISK ASSESSMENT IT SEEMS TO ME AS A PIPE IN THE UTILITIES AS WELL AS THE PC AND THE DILEMMA OF TRYING TO PROMOTE SAFETY CULTURE IN ORGANIZATIONS. NOT TO BE ENTIRELY NEGATIVE I DO WANT TO OFFER US SET UP SUGGESTIONS ARE REALLY ONE BIG SUGGESTION THE FIRST IS THE MAJOR ONE IS LET'S CONSIDER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY SYSTEM TO BE AN IMPORTANT AND URGENT SYSTEM PROBLEM. THAT FOCUS ONE INSTITUTION OR ORGANIZATION ALONE. I BELIEVE THIS CURRENT FUNCTIONING OF THIS SYSTEM. NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND IS WORTH THE PERHAPS OF A STATEWIDE TASK FORCE. TO MORE CAREFULLY UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY DEFICIENCIES IN THE ROOTS AS WELL AS TO DEVELOP A WIDER RANGE OF POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS THAT. COULD BE SEEN BY ANY OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS. A STATEWIDE TASK FORCE WOULD ALLOW US TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO'VE EXPERIENCED THE SAFETY SYSTEM FROM THEIR INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVES. THEIR VIEWS OF ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THEIR FRUSTRATIONS IN THE SYSTEM. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THIS FRAMEWORK OF A TASK FORCE WE COULD BEGIN THE CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS. FOR SAFETY PROMOTION AND REGULATION THERE ARE A WHOLE VARIETY OF THEM ONE OF THEM IS ASKING IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ALL OF THE WELL MANAGED INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT. ALWAYS ARE ASKING QUESTIONS. WHAT HAVE WE LEFT OUT. WHAT IS THE IMPLICATIONS WHAT WE SUE ME WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. IN ALL OF THE INSTITUTIONS BUT ALSO FOR ACROSS THE INSTITUTIONS. SO IF THE REGULATION IS DEVELOPED BY THE PEW SEAT HAS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE LIKELY RESPONSES OF THE UTILITIES TO DOING THIS WATER THEIR CAPACITIES TO COMPLY. SAFETY RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS WE REALLY HAVE TO UPGRADE OUR GAME IN ACTUALLY DOING RESEARCH THE LATEST RESEARCH ON SAFETY MANAGEMENT SAFETY CULTURE AND THINKING ABOUT METRICS TO MEASURE SAFETY CULTURE PROGRESS IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE FOR REGULATORS TO PROMOTE AND MONITOR AND OVERSEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAFETY CULTURE. REGULATION AND RULE MAKING WHERE CAN WE LOCATE THIS THE CPC HAS A WHOLE VARIETY OF REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES. MANY OF WHICH ARE AND OTHER MISSIONS SOME OF WHICH DON'T HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH SAFETY DIRECTLY. ACCIDENT AND INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS MAYBE WE COULD HAVE THE SAFETY BOARD EQUIVALENT TO THE N. T. S. B. THAT COULD INDEPENDENTLY AND WITH EXPERTISE AND WITH GREAT RESPECT IN THE STATE. UNDERTAKE THESE INVESTIGATIONS INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT. PRACTICES IN COMPLIANCE RIGHT NOW THE CPUC IS DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM OF AN INTEREST OF THE SAFETY CULTURE DEVELOPMENT. IN P. JEANNIE IT HAS NOWHERE NEAR THE INSPECTION FORCE. IT HAS THEY DID NOT THEMSELVES HAVE THE TRAINING TO ACTUALLY. UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SAFETY CULTURE AND KEEP TRACK OF IT ON AN ONGOING BASIS IN INDIVIDUAL. OUR INFRASTRUCTURES. THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT FOR SAFETY WHO'S GOING TO BE THE ADVOCATE FOR THE- INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF SAFETY IN THE AGENCIES. ARE IN. IN THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND IN THE INFRASTRUCTURES. SO AND LASTLY MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IN A STATEWIDE TASK FORCE FINDING A HOME FOR RESEARCH AND REGULATION OF INTERCONNECTED INFRASTRUCTURE RISK. RIGHT NOW WE ARE NOT REGULATING FOR INTERCONNECTED INFRASTRUCTURE RISK. THE UTILITIES ARE NOT DOING RISK ASSESSMENTS THAT CONSIDER INTER ASSET LET ALONE ENTER INFRASTRUCTURE RISKS. WE NEED TO TAKE THIS ON. A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE PIECES CPUC IN THEIR SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM I MENTIONED THIS TO MORE TOP LEVEL PERSON IN THE POLICY UNIT POLICY LEVEL. AND I SAID YOU'RE NOT REGULATED FOR INTERCONNECTED INFRASTRUCTURE RISK HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE BUSY COME BACK IN FIVE YEARS MAYBE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS WELL IT'S ALMOST BEEN FIVE YEARS SO IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S TIME IT'S TIME TO START TALKING ABOUT THE SYSTEM ADDRESSING. INTERCONNECTED INFRASTRUCTURE RISK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING AND I APPRECIATE- HAVING A CHANCE TO PRESENT THIS AND I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND. TO ANY QUESTIONS LATER ON. THANKS FOR YOU FOR MUCH FOR THE FILM AND THE- YOU ALWAYS. PROVIDED A REAL. A REALISTIC APPROACH AND- CERTAINLY AT AN HONEST APPRAISAL OF FACED SAFETY RISK AND- A- AND AN ASSESSMENT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. AT THIS POINT. TWO OF OUR FIRST PANEL. FIVE HAVE SOME MYSELF THAT I COULD START WITH AND IF SOME COME UP- PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND AND WE WILL GO TO THEM FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU ALL TO THE PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU'VE DONE EITHER SPECIFICALLY DURING THE SAN BRUNO. INCE'S OR IN THE YEARS SINCE. YOUR SAFETY PROMOTION HAS CERTAINLY IMPROVED OUR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS. WE ARE RULY GRATEFUL FOR THAT- IT TO A DIRECTOR HALL. QUESTION TWO FIVE MEG- YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF NTSB'S RECOMMENDATIONS. FROM THE SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BUT SIX REMAIN OPEN. I SEE FROM THE LIST PROVIDED TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE THE TWO OF THESE WERE RECOMMENDATIONS TO P. JEANNIE AND- THE CPUC ASKING FOR SPIKE TESS. FOLLOWED BY HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TESTS ON LINES WHERE THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE COULDN'T BE DETERMINED. I TO GET US UP TO SPEED COULD YOU TELL US WHY- THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE STILL OPEN AS YOU KNOW THEM AND THE IDEA I FROM MY UNDERSTANDING FROM LOOKING AT THE SOME OF THE LETTERS AND RESPONSES THAT THERE WAS A AN ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE PROVIDED BY P. JEANNIE AND THE CPUC OVER THOSE TWO ISSUES. DO YOU HAVE A THE SOME PRETTY CLEAR INFORMATION YOU CAN SHARE WITH THAT OF IT ALL. CERTAINLY THOSE PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATIONS REQUIRED- THAT PG&amp;E GO AND RETEST. MANY OF THEIR LINES TO REALLY ESTABLISH WHAT THE- OF. MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE WORKING PRESSURE SHOULD DATE. AND PG&amp;E HAS DILIGENTLY GONE AFTER THAT THEY'VE GONE AFTER THE BIGGEST SEGMENTS FIRST- AND AT THIS POINT THEY'VE COMPLETED IT. ALMOST ALL OF THEIR WORK. BUT THERE ARE SOME SMALL SEGMENTS THAT STILL NEED TO BE TESTED- THAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TO TEST. AND IT'S BEEN OUR- DECISION TO KEEP THESE RECOMMENDATIONS OPEN. AND TOLD EVERY LAST PIECE OF PIPE. IS EITHER TESTED OR REPLACED. ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW I'M PLEASED. WITH THE PROGRESS THAT THEY'VE- YOU KNOW COMPLETED ALMOST ALL OF THEIR SYSTEM THERE ARE THESE SMALL AREAS THAT STILL HAVE YET TO BE DONE AND WE WILL KEEP THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE OPEN UNTIL WE CAN BE TOLD THAT EVERY LAST START SEGMENT HAS BEEN TESTED. IF I UNDERSTAND IT IN- THE STATUS REPORT IN AUGUST OF TWENTY FOURTEEN STATED THAT THE- THAT THEY NOTED THAT PG&amp;E ESTIMATED THAT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETED BY TOWARD BE COMPLETED BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS OBVIOUSLY WERE. STILL THREE YEARS BEHIND THAT AND- AND SO IS THAT THEN OBVIOUSLY THAT'S STILL THE CASE THAT- FROM WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE HEARD AND I KNOW SOME OF THOSE LINES AND ESPECIALLY THE ARGUMENT I REMEMBER FONG ONE THIRTY TWO IN SAN BRUNO. TO WHY THEY COULDN'T OTHER THAN THE COST WAS THAT THEY COULD NOT PICK THOSE LINES TO ACTUALLY GET IN AND LOOK AT THOSE- BECAUSE OF THE ANGLES AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THERE AND I'M ASSUMING THAT STILL. APPROPRIATE ELSEWHERE AND THAT'S WHAT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING- YOU ALSO MENTIONED AND THAT THE NTSB RECOMMENDATIONS THAT AROSE FROM THE EXPLOSIONS THAT OCCURRED TWO YEARS AGO IN MASSACHUSETTS- CAN YOU PROVIDE A BIT MORE DETAIL ON WHAT YOU WERE REPORT FOUND REGARDING THE LACK OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS APPROVING NATURAL GAS PROJECTS THAT. YOU MENTIONED. EARLIER THAT NTSB SENT A LETTER TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY NINETEEN ASKING US TO ADOPT THIS RECOMMENDATION BUT YOU'RE STILL AWAITING A RESPONSE FROM THAT THAT LETTERS I GUESS I'M. CONCERNED OF. ONE THE- OR THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE ENGINEERS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT I GUESS THAT'S THE OBVIOUS- MIGHT BE BUT IT'S WHAT YOU FOUND IN THAT CASE AND- AND HAVE YOU STILL NOT RECEIVE THAT RESPONSE FROM CALIFORNIA. AS FAR AS I KNOW WE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE BUT- WHAT WE FOUND IS THE REVIEWS CYCLE FOR. THE DRAWINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS PROJECT IN MASSACHUSETTS WHICH WAS A CAST IRON REPLACEMENT PROJECT WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT. IS OCCURRING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE REVIEWS THAT WERE CONDUCTED WERE PRIMARILY FINANCIAL. AND NOT SAFETY REVIEWS AND THE SENIOR MANAGERS THAT SIGNED OFF ALTHOUGH THEY HAD PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER'S LICENSES THEY WERE REALLY ONLY CONDUCTING A FINANCIAL REVIEW OF THE PROJECTS AND IN FACT THE LEVEL AT WHICH PROJECTS GOT SIGNEDOFF ON WAS BASED SOLELY ON THE COST OF THE PROJECT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT THIS RECOMMENDATION WITH AP STAMP AN APPROVAL ON PLANS AND DRAWINGS THERE IS A PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY THAT ENGINEER THAT SIGNS THOSE PLANS SIGNS THOSE DRAWINGS IS PERSONALLY ATTESTING TO THE SAFETY OF HIS WORK. AND WE FELT THAT THAT ACCOUNTABILITY WAS MISSING IN THE STRUCTURE OF HOW THESE PROJECTS WERE BEING RUN AND HOW- UTILITIES WERE HANDLING THESE PROJECTS- WE INITIALLY MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO MASSACHUSETTS TO DO THAT BUT THEN DID FURTHER RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THIRTY ONE STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EXEMPTED UTILITIES FROM THIS REQUIREMENT OF HAVING A P. E. C. O. PLANS AND DRAWINGS- SO WE MADE THAT RECOMMENDATION ACROSS- NATIONALLY AND WE'RE STILL WAITING ON RESPONSES FROM SOME OF THE STATE'S CALIFORNIA BEING ONE OF THEM AND THANK YOU TO ALL AND- I HOPE THE CPUC WHEN THEY TESTIFY IN THE PAST SECOND PANEL WILL BE PREPARED TO. ANSWER WHY THESTATE HAS YET TO RESPOND TO THAT RECOMMENDATION- AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE TESTIMONY TODAY NOW WILL GO ON TO THE I. R. P. REPORT MISTER P. ONLY. YOU WERE PART OF THE TEAM INVOLVED AS YOU MENTIONED ON THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL OF EXPERTS INVESTIGATING THE SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION. THAT RESEARCH REPORTS BEEN EQUAL FOCUS ON THE UTILITY AS IT DID ON ITS REGULATOR THE CQC AND ASIF USUALLY FOCUS WAS NOT JUST WANTED PROVIDING MORE OVERSIGHT BUT THAT THE CQC HAD CULTURAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED. YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROPER BUT NO WILL BEGINNING HIS EASY CONTINUING. HIS HARD. WHAT OF THE- FROM SAN BRUNO HAVE BEEN TO. IN IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION WHERE DO FUTURE TRAPS OF LIFE IN THAT. BOTH THE THAT'S THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION THE CREDIT PRECIADO IT. THE I THE GREATEST CHALLENGES- MOVING FORWARD. ARE ARE IN THE AREA OF. I GUESS I WOULD I WOULD SEE IT SUSTAIN SUSTAINING THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE AT THAT HAS BEEN DONE- AS IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT. WE'RE DOING OR WE'RE DOING MORE WITH LESS PEOPLE- AND THEREFORE- PEOPLE'S EFFORTS. CAN TEND TO REGRESS TO THE MOMENT- AND NOT MAINTAIN THE LONG TERM VIEW- I LOOK AT IT FAIRLY SIMPLY AND AT WHEN I LOOK AT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND SO ON AND I SAY TO MYSELF YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT MY- MY GRANDCHILDREN OR MY- MY DAUGHTER MY GRANDMOTHER. LIVING NEXT TO THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS CAR. INFRASTRUCTURE GOING INTO THE GROUND- SO THE ROOTS THE CHALLENGE IS AS A I USE THE WORD MINDFUL IT'S BEING. A MITIGATING DISTRACTIONS THAT ARE AROUND WHETHER IT BE TELEPHONES AND SO FORTH- AND LIKEWISE TO RECOGNIZE THAT SAFETY TAKING A MILITARY APPROACH IS YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU THEY'RE LOOKING OUT FOR YOU THAT THAT YOU'RE ABLE. TO WITHOUT FEAR OF RETRIBUTION BOB POINT OUT WHERE SOMEONE IS NOT FOLLOWING THE OF THE PROCEDURE DOCUMENTING THESE NEAR MISSES THAT- THAT ARE REALLY A LEADING INDICATOR OF MORE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS SO I THOSE ARE SOME AREAS THAT I THINK REALLY ARE THE CHALLENGE OF FOR JUST IT IT IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE. AND S. AND- MAKING THEM BE ABLE TO SUCCEED IN THEIR- IN THE WORK THAT THEY DO. VERY GOOD THANK YOU I READ ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER PELION AND I KNOW SENATOR STERN HAS A QUESTION- HE I'VE ALSO HEARD YOU DISCUSSED IN IN PAST PRESENTATIONS HOW THE SHARING OF LESSONS LEARNED IS AN- IS AN IDENTIFIED GAP ACROSS THE UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND INDUSTRY. AND EVEN SOMETIMES ACROSS THE VARIOUS DIVISIONS OF A CORPORATION AND IT'S BEEN MY OPINION AND AS WE'VE WATCHED OVER THE YEARS P. JEANNIE LEARNED. AND REALLY THE I THINK A GOOD JOB IN MANY AREAS OF IMPLEMENTING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FROM THE SAN BRUNO IN ITS GAS DIVISIONS BUT THOSE LESSONS WEREN'T SHARED ADEQUATELY WITH ITS ELECTRIC DIVISION AS WE'VE SEEN IN UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA HAS PAID A HIGH AND PAINFUL PRICE FOR THAT. WHAT ARE YOUR WHAT ARE STRATEGIES OR TOOLS THAT REGULATORS CAN USE TO ENSURE PROMOTION OF SAFETY SO THAT IT'S ACCESSIBLE TO BOTH INTERNAL. AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS. I THINK THE MOST TO TWO POINTS ONE IS LIKE I TALK ABOUT TRUST HI A TALK ABOUT THE END ABOUT A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP. IT PROVIDING AN OPEN DISCUSSION. IT'S ESSENTIAL BETWEEN IT WHETHER BETWEEN ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THE REGULATORS THE PIPELINE OPERATORS THE CONTRACTORS- AND AT THEN AGAIN A SYSTEM PROCESS. WITHIN THE WORK TO SHARE THOSE LESSONS- YOU KNOW WE DO WITNESSING YEAH SKINNER. P. GENIES AN EXAMPLE WHERE THEY HAVE NUMEROUS DIVISIONS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE OF THE- OF THE STATE AND THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY AND- YOU KNOW SOMETHING CAN HAPPEN IN ONE AREA. YOU KNOW FIND ONE KIND OF DEFECT AND IT BECOMES TRIBAL AND LOCAL KNOWLEDGE SO IN ORDER TO EXPAND THAT- IT TAKES A NUMBER OF SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES BUT IT BOILS DOWN TO BEING- BEING TO OPEN FACILITATING THAT THAT EXCHANGE. BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY AND- AND RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS A SYMBIOTIC NATURE BETWEEN REGULATION REGULATORS THE OVERSIGHT. AT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE BRINGING THEIR EXPERIENCE FROM MULTIPLE OUR- OPERATORS TO. THE INDIVIDUAL OPERATOR SO. I THINK FOSTERING THAT THAT THAT THAT- EXCHANGE IS IMPORTANT VERY GOOD THANK YOU REVEALING NOW GO TO A SENATOR STERN. YOU HAD A QUESTION THE FLOOR IS YOURS. YEAH JUST VERY BRIEFLY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY I DON'T OF- YOU YOU'VE DUG IN PRETTY THOROUGHLY HERE I JUST I DID WANT TO FOLLOW UP ONE TO TWO PARTICULAR ITEMS I WAS INTERESTED IN THE- ASK FORCE RECOMMENDATION FROM DR SHOWMAN AND HOW. YOU SEE THAT INTERFACING- WITH THE CURRENT RISK BASED. RATEMAKING PROCESS THROUGH THE S. MAP AND RAMPS- PROCESS. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT THAT'S WHAT A TASK FORCE CONCEPT- INTERFACING WITH THE SORT OF CURRENT PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION PROCESS AND I THINK ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THAT. D. AS I RECALL FROM THE LOOK. PANEL WAS FOR- AT THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE OF THIS C. P. UC'S SAFETY ARM IN IN RATE CASES- WHICH IN IN THE PAST THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN. AND EXPERIENCE WERE YOU KNOW DEVOID IN THAT PROCESS- I'M NOT OVERLY AND TO BE QUITE HONEST I'M NOT OVERLY FAMILIAR WITH WITH THE DIDN'T WHAT WHAT THE- RAMPS AND THE OTHER IS. NOT AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT I. DIFFERENT QUESTION FOR YOU MIND THAT THAT FIRST COURSE WAS MORE FOR DOCTOR SHAMAN BECAUSE I SAW IN- YOUR REMARKS DR SHOWMAN ABOUT THIS TASK FORCE CONCEPT. AND MAYBE THE INTERFACE WITH THE CURRENT. RIGHT J. KENNEDY CAN YOU HEAR ME YES OKAY RIGHT I'VE BEEN ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THAT UP PROCESS OF RELATIVELY CLOSELY- AND I HAVE SOME ROOM I THINK IT TASK FORCE NEEDS TO LOOK AT THIS THIS PROCESS MORE CAREFULLY- AS YOU MAY KNOW THE P. C. HAS ITSELF- ENDORSED A PARTICULAR APPROACH TO DOING RISK ASSESSMENTS. BY THE UTILITIES. A MULTI ATTRIBUTE VALUATION FUNCTION MESSAGE OUR AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO ALLOW THE UTILITIES TO ACTUALLY COMPUTE RISK SPEND DEFICIENCIES DOWN TO A YEARLY. NUMBER OF. FRACTIONS OF SAFE. OF SERIOUS INJURIES OR FATALITIES PER YEAR SAVED BY CERTAIN INVESTMENTS THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THOSE ARE THOSE ASSESSMENTS DO NOT USE HUMAN AND ORGANIZATIONAL AND MANAGEMENT VERY BOOKS THERE ARE TREMENDOUS UNCERTAINTY AND NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL'S JUST COME DOWN REALLY HARD IN A STATEMENT ABOUT RISK ASSESSMENTS THAT DO NOT CHARACTERIZE THEIR UNCERTAINTY. THAT OFFER SINGLE VALUE STATEMENTS AND NUMBERS WITHOUT REALIZING OR WITHOUT EVEN ADDRESSING WHAT IS LEFT OUT IN TERMS OF VARIABLES WHAT WHAT ON YOUR- WHAT IT REAL ON RELIABILITY THERE MIGHT BE IN THE ACTUAL NUMBERS THEMSELVES WELL THIS IT SEEMS TO ME IS THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR THOSE EFFORTS. TO RATIONALIZE IF YOU WILL THE SAFETY INVESTMENT PROCESS. IN THE RAPE CASES ULTIMATELY FIRST AND THEN YOU NEED A FIGHT IF I COULD SAY ABSENCE MAKES. PUT IT MORE SIMPLY. TO QUANTITATIVE IN TECH OF MATCH NOT QUALITY. AND HUMAN. I THINK THAT BE MORE QUANTITATIVE BUT WITH A RANGE OF ESTIMATES AND ADDING MORE VARIABLES ON SO WHAT HAPPENS IS A FALSE PRECISION IS CONVEYED ABOUT THE ACTUAL. FIRE IS ATION OF RISKS WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS MADE AND SELL INVESTMENTS WILL BE MADE WHICH WILL NOT YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE INVESTMENT OUT REPLACING A PIPELINE FOR EXAMPLE BUT IF THE INSPIRED BY ISN'T EXPECTED. IF IT'S NOT MAINTAINED IF IT'S NOT OPERATED WITHIN ACCEPTABLE PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES THEN YOU DON'T GET THAT RISK MITIGATION OUT OF IT AND RIGHT NOW THE P. YOU SEE IS NOT IN POSITION TO ESTIMATE THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT CAPACITY. SURROUNDING THESE HARD HARDWARE INVESTMENTS THAT IS TRYING TO GET SO I THINK THIS IS A REAL ISSUE AND IT'S A PRACTICAL ISSUE I'M I KNOW I'M RAMBLING ON HERE NO NO TELL ME BUT IT WAS NOT ONLY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES BUT SOCIETY FOR RISK ANALYSIS HAS ALSO. COME DOWN ON THE FAILURE FAILURE TO CHARACTERIZE UNCERTAINTIES IF THE STATE IF THE PSC WERE TO ACTUALLY MAKE A- CORRECT CASE DECISION WHICH ALLOWED THE UTILITIES TO INVEST IN SOMETHING AND GAIN COMPENSATION THROUGH RATES. THEY WOULD BE VERY VULNERABLE TO COURT SUITS PEOPLE COULD TAKE THEM TO COURT AND HAD EXPERT WITNESSES FROM THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OR FROM THE SAFETY PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF THE SOCIETY FOR RISK ANALYSIS IT'S JUST A VERY POOR FOUNDATION. AND I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS PROCESS A LOT MORE CAREFULLY AND WE NEED TO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SAFETY MANAGEMENT SAFETY CULTURE AS VARIABLES IN ASSESSING RISK AND RISK MITIGATION EXCELLENT THANK YOU FOR THAT MY ONE OTHER QUESTION AND WE FOCUSED A LOT. ON THIS PANEL AND- IN GENERAL IT IS PROCEEDING BACK TYPE LINE SAFETY SPECIFICALLY- I HATE IT IF IT'S OUTSIDE THE SCOPE I UNDERSTANDBUT PART OF THAT THE DISASTER AT LEAST CANYON WAS ALSO ABOUT. STORAGE RIGHT SAFETY OUR FENCE A IS NOT HERE TODAY THE BETTER LEVEL AS WELL AS PART ENERGY DID. ONCE EIGHT DOT WAS LOOK TO ADOPT GAS SAFETY MEASURES THAT ARE STILL MISTER STATE WHY BUT MINOR IS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. ROLLED BACK MANY OF THOSE EFFORTS TO PROMULGATE GUIDELINES IN THE REGULATIONS. ANY COMMENTS I DIDN'T KNOW IF ANY OF OUR PANELISTS WERE FOLLOWING UP LIKE DOES THAT LACTOSE. FEDERAL OVERSIGHT INACTION LEADS OUR STATE MORE VULNERABLE. THIS IS AYE AS I RECALL- FILMS- ISSUED AN EMERGENCY. I'LL SAY ORDER. THAT THAT THAT. THAT THAT CALLED FORTH FOR STORAGE OPERATORS TO ADOPT ERTAIN- ANSI STANDARDS AS IT RELATES TO YOU KNOW THE WELL THE WELL THE WELL IN THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WAS AND THAT THE YOU KNOW THE WAY OPERATORS LOOK AT IT IS THAT'S NOT PROMULGATED REGULATIONS SO IT'S A IT'S A NICE TO HAVE. ADD I THINK THOSE TWO. ARE YOU KNOW OUR OUR OUR OUR GOOD I ENCOURAGE. ALSO TO LOOK INTERNATIONALLY- HIGH SO STANDARDS- AND- IT ENDED UP DON'T. YOU THINK CALIFORNIA'S STORAGE INDEPENDENT OR ARE YOU. ARE HEADED TO KERR ON ON THAT IS. THAT THE FEDERAL. IS CRITICAL. I'M I CAN'T REALLY I CAN'T TO ASSESS. I DON'T INTO THE INDIVIDUALS OKAY WHILE SAYING THAT ALSO FOR A FUTURE PANEL I'M SURE THAT YOUR UTILITIES AND PC MAY HAVE SOME INSIGHT THERE AND YOU AND MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ALL CHANNELS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN THE REQUESTED FOR PROFESSOR SHERMAN THE OF AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- WITH THE TOOLS THAT REGULATORS CAN USE TO ENCOURAGE SAFETY FROM- THE ENTITIES THAT THEY REGULATE THE- AND I KNOW YOU STUDY THIS THIS IN DEPTH- PERHAPS YOU CAN TOUCH AND WHAT TOOLS. ARE USED IN OTHER INDUSTRIES INDUSTRIES I KNOW YOU'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND- ON NUCLEAR THE IN NUCLEAR IN INDUSTRY AND AERONAUTICS AND HOW THEY HAVE DONE THIS AND HOW THAT THAT DIFFERENCE THERE. THAT WE'VE SEEN I KNOW- OUR REGULATORS ARE TYPICALLY LEFT WITH FINES. OR AND CITATIONS. ANY OUT COMPLY. IN THIS HAD MIXED. SO THOUGHTS PLAY YEAH WHAT ONE DID. THIS EVAN TO ME IS THAT BOTH THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION AND THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION. THEY DO RESEARCH THEY ACTUALLY ARE SOURCE OF RESEARCH THEMSELVES AND THEY CONTRACT OUT SPECIFICALLY FOR RESEARCH ON SAFETY QUESTIONS. OF A PROSPECTIVE NATURE NOT JUST THE RETROSPECTIVE. NATURE AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY DEFICIENT IN OUR APPROACH IT'S A TOOL THAT IS NOT IN THE CURRENT KIT OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. SO THEY HAVE TO THEY MAY HAVE HIRED. A CONSULTANT OR HAD THE UTILITY HIRING CONSULTANTS. BUT THAT USUALLY IS IN THE CONFINES OF NARAL CONFINES OF THE PRECEDING ABOUT IN A SPECIFIC ACCIDENT- THIS ISSUE OF SAFETY METRICS. WE HAVE ANY THE CPS DOES NOT HAVE THE INDICATORS. IN IN ANY NEEDS TO HAVE METRICS AND IT NEEDS TO WORK THOSE OUT WITH UTILITIES THEMSELVES SO THEY MAKE SENSE TO UTILISE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THE UTILITIES- ABOUT WHAT METRICS WOULD MAKE SENSE WHAT WHAT THINGS ARE LEADING INDICATORS WITH RESPECT TO THE- ATIONS ARE DEFICIENCIES IN SAFETY MANAGEMENT- FOR THE LAPSES IN SAFETY CULTURE. SO I THINK THAT THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. PROCESS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THEN AGAIN I GO BACK TO THE INSPECTION THE THIS PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION IN THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE THE INSPECTIONS TOOL TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT IS A VERY. COMPLICATED. LONG TERM UP ON CERTAIN PROCESS OF DEVELOPING SAFETY CULTURE. IT IS AN UNCERTAIN JOURNEY AND IT'S A CONSTANT JOURNEY AND IT NEEDS THE P. C. NEEDS TO HAVE AN INSPECTION FORCE OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BE CONTINUALLY AROUND THE PUBLIC THE NATIONAL NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION HAS TO RESIDENT INSPECTORS FOR EVERY ONE OF ITS NUCLEAR PLANTS AND- NUCLEAR PROCESSING PLANT STATED OVERSEAS THERE THERE ALL THE TIME- DID YOU SEE DOESN'T HAVE TO GET TO THAT LEVEL BUT IT NEEDS TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PEOPLE. SO THEY CAN GO MEET BE PART OF THE OPERATIONS WATCH THEM IN REAL TIME TALK TO PEOPLE- AND HAVE THE SKILLS AND THE TRAINING TO KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN CONNECTION WITH A SAFETY CULTURE IN L. THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT'S IN IN A REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE IN ITS KICK SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT. OUR REALLY NO GAPS IN OUR CURRENT APPROACHES. THE TO THE VERY SIGNIFICANT IN. A JUDO AND YOU'VE HEARD ONE OF THE TOOLS DISCUSSED WITH CALIFORNIA UTILITIES HAS BEEN THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVIZING. SAFE PERFORMANCE BASED ON CERTAIN AGREED METRICS THE- IT RANGES FROM INCENTIVES TO PACK- PACKAGES FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT OR TIME UTILITIES RATE OF RETURN TO SAFETY. WHAT ARE THE PITFALLS OF SUCH A TOOL TO BE USED OF THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE AND THEY HAVE THEIR MANY. FIRST OFF. ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S INTERESTING IS THE MOTIVATION OF PEOPLE TO BE SAFE- PEOPLE HAVE MOTIVATION OF THE TYPES. MANY OF THEM ARE. SOME OF THEM ARE COERCIVE YOU'LL BE PUNISHED IF YOU DON'T DO X. SOME OF THEM ARE ON NORMATIVE. BEEN A GOOD SAFETY CULTURE. PEOPLE HAVE AN IDENTITY THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFETY AS PART OF WHO THEY ARE. WHEN YOU TRY TO ADD INCENTIVES ON TOP OF THAT BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT ACTUALLY UNDERMINES THE SENSE OF THEIR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY AS SAFETY. PROFESSIONALS THE OTHER SIDE OF COURSE IS WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE THAT IF IT'S A HIGH STAKE METRIC. WHERE HUGE FINANCIAL AMOUNTS ARE INVOLVED. OR EVEN MAJOR PUNISHMENTS TO THE METRIC PEOPLE WILL TRY TO MANAGE TO THE METRIC OR DISTORT THE METRIC. THAT THOSE ARE REAL PITFALLS IF YOU CAN TAKE THE CASE OF P. JEANNIE. I WROTE SOME TESTIMONY AFTER THE LOCATED MARC CASE POINTING OUT WHAT A DRAMATIC CASE THAT WAS TO SHOW. THE LACK OF A SAFETY CULTURE IN THAT ORGANIZATION. IF YOU. IMPOSE BENEFITS. FOR METRICS IN A SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T HAVE SAFETY CULTURE CONSTRAINTS. THEN I THINK YOU RUN AT EVEN GREATER RISK OF PEOPLE DISTORTING THEIR BEHAVIOR TO LOOK GOOD TO THE METRIC WHICH IS A WELL UNDERSTOOD PHENOMENON IN A VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS. THANK YOU IT IN AND JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION TO DIRECTOR HALL AND THE MISTER P. ONLY DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER TOOLS THAT- FOR SAFETY REGULATORS THAT YOU MIGHT SUGGEST- BRIEFLY. THIS IS CHRIS I THINK I WOULD I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT. SOMETHING THAT WAS RAISED WITH REGARD TO THE RESEARCH ASPECTS OF IT AND OF COURSE THAT- I'LL SAY FROM AN INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE USED TO BE DONE THROUGH- G. R. I. AND SO FORTH WHEN IT WAS BEING FUNDED BY. SURCHARGES A TRANSPORTATION OR THE SALE OF GAS WELL ONE OF THE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT IT IS REALLY OF INTEREST TO THAT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO THE LEGISLATURE IS LOOKING AT AT- WHAT IS DONE IN THE U. K. AND ESTABLISHING- AS PART OF. THERE PERFORMANCE A SETTING UP A RESEARCH POOL OF FUNDS SO FORTH THAT. THAT THAT IT THAT IS A COOPERATIVE- IN PROVIDING FUNDING FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF. OF TECHNOLOGY THAT IS THEN TIED TO- YOU KNOW THE COMPANY'S GREAT I'LL SAY THEY DON'T HAVE RATED RATE OF RETURN IF YOU WILL. SENSUALLY THAT THAT. THERE THESE FUNDS ARE ESTABLISH SUCH THAT OR THE POOL IS SET UP THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN DO THIS RESEARCH- AND IT'S I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY IT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL I KNOW THAT THEY DEVELOP ROBOT THAT THEY THEY IMPLEMENTED ROBOTIC. THE SYSTEMS WITH REGARD TO CAST IRON PIPE WHICH MITIGATE REDUCE THE SIGNIFICANTLY THE COST OF REPLACEMENT AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND I REALIZE YOU KNOW THANK CALIFORNIA WE DON'T THERE IS AN CAST IRON IN THIS IS THAT IT CERTAINLY DISTRIBUTION ASPECT OF IT BUT- AGAIN OFF JIM- THIS THIS APPROACH MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT COULD MAY BE APPROPRIATE. FOR A- IN CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIA. GOOD THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL DID YOU HAVE A- COMMENT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FROM THE PRICING STANDPOINT. BUT RATES SAT AND UTILITIES ARE PAID BASED ON THEIR RATES AND THAT THE PRICING TENDS TO BE HAVE MORE POLITICAL INFLUENCE AND THAT- THE THOSE APPOINTED TO THOSE BOARDS EXCEPT PRICES ARE. VERY INTERESTED GIVING CUSTOMERS THE LOWEST PRICE AND WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST DECADE I DECREASE IN THE RATE OF NATURAL GAS THE COST OF NATURAL GAS RATHER CONSIDERABLE. AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN THATREGULATORS- WILL TELL THIS THE PIPELINE COMPANIES WELL IF THERE ISN'T A REGULATION YOU CANNOT GET COST REIMBURSED FOR IMPROVING SAFETY. AND IT'S A DISINCENTIVE FOR PIPELINE COMPANIES TO GO BEYOND WHAT THE REGULATIONS HAVE AND THAT THAT'S BEEN A CONCERN- THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE AND THEN THE- REGULATION OF THE PRICES AND THE COST REIMBURSEMENT. THANK YOU ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR THE PANEL THAT- EVIL TOUCHED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ORGANIZATIONAL SAFETY AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SAID DURING YOUR TESTIMONY AND HOW ONE OF THE MAIN NATIONAL CONVERSATIONS TO ARISE OUT OF SAN BRUNO IS THE SMS POLICY I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT SMS IS THE VARIOUS MEANS OF MANAGEMENT AND HOW THEY OVERLAP YOU CAN MANAGE AN ASSET AS IS THE CASE WITH INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT WORK MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THE NTSB AND OUR P. REPORTS BUT YOU CAN ALSO MANAGE PEOPLE. IDEALLY THE UTILITIES WILL DO BOTH WELL BUT THE CAN YOU DISCUSS THE ROLE OF SMS POLICIES AND THE ROLE THEY SHOULD BE PLAYING AT THE UTILITIES AND OF THE P. YOU SEE HOW THE REGULATOR REGULATORS SHOULD BE REVIEWING THESE POLICIES. I COULD SAY A LITTLE ABOUT THAT IN TWO RESPECTS. ONE IS THERE'S AN INTERESTING. HEAD OF RESEARCH FINDINGS THAT INDICATE THAT THE ABILITY OF THE UTILITY TO DEVELOP A STRONG SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS RELATED TO THE POWERFUL TO THE POWER OF THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN THE REGULATOR ITSELF THAT SOMEHOW IT HELPS PEOPLE TO BE SAFETY MANAGERS IN THE UTILITY. IF PEOPLE IN THE UTILITY RESPECT THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT CAPACITY IN THE REGULATING AGENCY ITSELF IS ALSO TRUE ON THE OTHER HAND THAT THE ABILITY OF A REGULATOR TO ENFORCE VARIOUS REGULATIONS DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN THE REGULATED ORGANIZATION SO THERE'S A MUTUAL. CONNECTION HERE BETWEEN BOTH BOTH OF THEM NEED TO HAVE GOOD EFFECTIVE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS- SO I THINK THAT THAT'S KIND OF A FINDING THAT WE'VE WE'VE COME TO- IN LOOKING AT AT THOSE THOSE SYSTEMS. THANK YOU. OTHER THOUGHTS. AL JUST REPEAT WHAT I'VE EVER REALLY SAID IT WITH REGARD TO MANAGEMENT- AGAIN- IT IS EXTREMELY IT IS BROAD LOOKING AT THE INTERNAL INEC EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS ALL OF THAT MANAGEMENT WHETHER YOU'RE MANAGING THE CONTRACTORS- YOU HAVE A YOU HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE- COMMISSION YOU HAVE THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES. YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR- STAKEHOLDERS- AND- M. REALLY IT IT IT COMES TO. CROSSED IT I CAN'T REALLY DEFINE TRUST IS LIKE IS LIKE CULTURE IT'S VERY- IT MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT IT'S BEING ABLE TO. THANK TO- REMOVE. SORT OF THIS ADVERSARIAL. NATURE REMOVING THIS- L. C. PUNITIVE. IT NATURE AND END. THAT'S WHAT WE'LL THAT'S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF I THINK THE MANAGEMENT TO IT QUESTION OF THE BY BY OUR SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS PEOPLE SYSTEMS PROCESSES. VERY GOOD THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU TO THE FIRST PANELISTS- THAT- AND ASK IF POSSIBLE YOU COULD TO STAY ON THE LINE THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTIONS THAT MAY COME UP LATER IF YOU HAVE THAT THE CHANCE TO DO THAT. I NOW WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM OUR SECOND PANEL WHICH WILL DISCUSS HOW THESE ESSONS FROM SAN BRUNO HAVE BEEN CARRIED FORWARD AND CAN INFORM THE FUTURE DECISION MAKING THAT WE WILL BE SEEN OUR FIRST SPEAKER. WILL BE- DIRECTOR LEE PALMER WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SAFETY AND ENFORCEMENT DIVISION- MISTER PALMER WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. I COULD AFTERNOON SHERMAN AND I DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME- AGAIN THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE. YOU WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ACTIVITIES WITH REGARDS TO GAS UTILITY SAFETY. AND RELIABILITY SENSE SEMINAR TRAGEDY. AGAIN MY NAME IS LEE PALMER AND I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS DIRECTOR OF THE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION OR STD WITHIN THE CPC. I WAS A POINT ON JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND CRIED RIGHT SERVED AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF STDS. SINCE AUGUST SECOND OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. DO I'M IN OUR FOR HIM NEXT. NATIONAL GUARD AS A LIEUTENANT COLONEL AND I'M CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE CHALLENGE MATTER DISORDERS. SUPPORT BATTALION BASED ON A BELL CALIFORNIA. IN MY SHORT TERM THE PC. I'VE SEEN THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES GAS LINE EXPLOSIONS. AND GAS STORAGE WEEKS. MANY OF THESE EVENTS HAVE BEEN EXASPERATED BY THE IMPACTS TO KOBE NINETEEN IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WE'RE ALL OPERATING WITHIN TODAY. ADDRESSING IS A BUNCH THREE STD SAFETY ENFORCEMENT WORK IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF MYSELF AND THE TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS WITHIN THE CPC RETRACT THE ARTICLE IN MY PEERS. MY TEAM ON THE GAS SAFETY SIDE AND I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING ELEVEN LARGE AND SMALL GAS OPERATORS. 200-010-0401 MOBILE HOME PARKS SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE PROPANE SYSTEMS AND THIRTEEN MUNICIPAL SYSTEMS. IS INCLUDES OVER TEN THOUSAND MILES OF TRANSMISSION AND TWO HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF DISTRIBUTION MILES AND TWELVE UNDERGROUND GAS STORAGE FACILITIES. IT IS AN ENORMOUS TASK AND ONE WE DO NOT TAKE LIGHTLY. BEFORE CONTINUING I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO YOU START ALL FOR YOUR COMMIT. TO THE SAFETY RESPONSE AT THIS P. C. OVERLAP TEN YEARS. YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND THOUGHTFULNESS HAVE LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT ENHANCEMENT OF NUMEROUS SAFETY LAWS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT THE CPC HAS ACTIVELY WORKED TO IMPLEMENT OVER THE YEARS. I BELIEVE THAT YOUR IMPACT AS IMPROVE THE OPERATIONAL AND LONG TERM SAFETY OF THE REGULATED UTILITIES AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. BUT AGAIN TODAY I'VE BEEN INVITED TO ADDRESS HOW THE CPC HAS APPLIED THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM DECEMBER OF TRAGEDY TEKELI THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ARISING FROM THE NUMEROUS INVESTIGATIONS ALL OF THE INCIDENT. ON SEPTEMBER NINTH TWENTY TWENTY TO LEADERSHIP AND STAFF THE CPC TOOK TIME TO MARKET TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY HI PLAN EXPLOSIONS THAT RENOWNED. HONORING THE VICTIMS AND REFLECTING ON SAFETY RELATED CHANGES MADE FOLLOWING THAT CAN. EVENTS THE DEVASTATION THIS EVENT IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND THE LESSONS LEARNED REMAIN AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MEMORIES AND ACTIONS. DURING THE STOCK REMEMBRANCE PRESENT BETTER STATED CPUC REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT HAS BECOME MORE PROACTIVE TO A MULTI YEAR MULTI BILLION DOLLAR HI FRIENDS SAFETY TESTING AND REPLACEMENT PROGRAM. INCREASED STAFF CITATION AUTHORITY INCREASED FREQUENCY OF INSPECTIONS AND THE MORE THAN TRIPLING OF OUR STAFF OF GAS SAFETY ENGINEERS. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THIS CPUC HEALTHCARE COSTS THIS IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS FIRST THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD NTSB RECOMMENDED THAT THE CPC CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT ALL ASPECTS OF P. JEANNIE OPERATIONS. INCLUDING CONTROL ROOM OPERATIONS EMERGENCY PLANNING RECORD KEEPING PERFORMANCE SPACE REST AND INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AND PUBLIC AWARENESS PROGRAMS. THESE REGULATIONS TO STRENGTHEN PIPELINE SAFETY AND- AND RECORD KEEPING WORK BASED ON. ACCIDENT. D. IS. THE REGULAR TO STRENGTHEN SAFETY AND RECORD KEEPING WERE BASED ON NTSB RECOMMENDATIONS IN ORDER TO SEE IF YOU SEE DECISIONS AND LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE TESTING OR REPLACING GAS TRANSMISSION PIPELINES AND PRIORITIZE POPULATED AREAS. SECOND THE NTSB RECOMMENDED TO THE CPUC REQUIRE PG&amp;E TO CORRECT AL DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED AS A RESULT OF THIS SAN BRUNO INSTANT MASTICATION AS WELL AS ANY ADDITIONAL DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT. AND VERIFY THAT ALL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE COMPLETED IS THE PC. REVIEWED SIX P. JEANNIE COMPLIANCE REPORTS AND CONDUCTED AUDITS TO ENSURE COMPLETION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OR FALL OF THE ACTIONS PENDING. THIRD NTSB RECOMMENDED AND THEN VALUATION OF THE AUTHORITY AND ABILITY OF STD TO AFFECTED REINFORCED STATE GAS PIPELINE SAFETY REGULATIONS. TODAY STDS ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY AND OVERSIGHT IS FAR SUPERIOR THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO. SB ACTIVELY HOLDS THE TORIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR FAILING TO MEET SAFETY OPERATION STANDARDS THROUGH AUDITS INVESTIGATIONS ASSESSMENTS OF FINES AND PENALTIES. AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MONITORING. THE UTILITY CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS. AND LASTLY TO FORTY NINE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS ONE NINE TWO POINT SIX ONE NINE WAS AMENDED TO DELETE THE GRANDFATHER CLAUSE AND REQUIRE THAT ALL GAS TRANSMISSION PIPELINES CONSTRUCTED BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY BE SUBJECTED TO A HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TEST. THAT INCORPORATE DESPITE TESTS. TO THIS ACTION DOES THE PC HAS GAINED VALUABLE INSIGHT AND ALL. WORKING WITH UTILITIES TO BE MORE PROACTIVE INSPECTION OF GAS INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL SAFETY CONCERNS. NOW TURNING TO OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE LAW I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THE STATE LEGISLATION FOR EXAMPLE ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT WAS PASSED TO ENSURE THAT THE NTSB RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDRESSED THE NEW REQUIREMENTS CODIFIED BY THIS BILL LET TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PIPELINE SAFETY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM WHICH FOSTER NEW AND ROBUST SAFETY AND RELIABILITY% REGULATIONS FOR NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PIPELINES. IS INCLUDED REQUIRING A GAS OPERATOR IT HAS TO CURRENT STANDARDS FOR A PLACE EIGHTEEN GAS PIPELINES AND TO ESTABLISH A MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE. OPERATING PRESSURE TO TESTING. SEVERAL OTHER PIECE STATE. HAVE IMPROVED OUR GAS SAFETY OVERSIGHT SINCE THE TRAGIC ZAMBRANO'S. FAMILY BILL FIFTY SIX REQUIRED REMOTE CONTROLLED SHUT OFF VALVES AND HIGH POPULATION AREAS AND THE COMPREHENSIVE TESTING AND RECORD KEEPING US GAS TRANSMISSION PIPELINES. SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF AB FIFTY SIX P. JEANNIE HAS COMPLETED THE AUTOMATION OF TORRANCE SEVENTEEN VALVES AND COMPLETED SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PIPELINE MILES OF STRENGTH TESTING. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE THE NATURAL GAS LEAKAGE ABATEMENT ESTABLISHED. THE PROGRAM WAS TO ELEMENTS AND ANNUAL EMISSIONS INVENTORY REPORT. I AM A COMPLIANCE PLAN THE OVERALL GOAL IS FOR THE ARE USED TO REDUCE NATURAL GAS EMISSIONS FROM A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BASELINE LEVEL BY 40% IN TWENTY THIRTY CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERALL STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE. GAS REDUCTION GOAL THE COMPLIANCE PLAN IS DUE FROM THE IRA YEARS EVERY TWO YEARS TO COMPLY FINE DETAILS HOW THE UTILITY PROPOSES TO ADDRESS THE TWENTY SIX BACKS BEST PRACTICES FOR A WEEK ABATEMENT. THAT WERE DEVELOPED DURING THE COMMISSION PROCEEDINGS. SAFETY POLICY DIVISION RECEIVED THE FIRST ONE OF THE TO THE FIRST ONE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE LATEST FORM THIS YEAR. THANK YOU POLICY DIVISION OR SPD RIGHT NOW VALUATION PROVIDED TO ENERGY DIVISION TO ADDRESS COST. IN ADDITION SENATE BILL EIGHT SIXTY FIVE FILL THE GAP IN THE CPC'S ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY BY GRANTING THE DIG SAFE BORDER FORCE MAJORITY OR THIRD PARTY EXCAVATORS. AND ALLOWING THEM TO ISSUE PENALTIES TO THE TRUMP NONCOMPLIANCE AND UNSAFE PRACTICES. SIXTEEN FOR PROGRAM FOR GAS AND ELECTRIC VIOLATIONS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE GAS SAFETY RELIABILITY BRANCHES ALSO KNOWS GSR BE UNDER SEG HAS CONDUCTED HUNDREDS OF FIELD AUDITS RECORDS. STAFF INVESTIGATIONS AND IS ASSESSED OVER FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN STOCK LEVEL ONE CITATIONS THE P. JEANNIE FOR GAS SAFETY VIOLATIONS. THE GUY STATE DURABILITY BRANCH HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN PERFORMING INSPECTIONS OF GAS UTILITIES PIECE OF WORK BY WITNESSING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS HYDRO TESTING IN LINE INSPECTION AND PIPELINE REPLACEMENT. CPC'S GOAL IS TO DEDICATE 20% OVER FUEL TIME GAS PIPELINE DESIGN TESTING PER CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. THIS MEANS MORE BOOTS ON GROUND AND MORE EYES EXAMINING GAS PIPELINE INSTALLATION PRESSURE TESTING SPECIMENS. ALSO DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE CPC CREATED A CITATION PROCESS AUTHORIZING STAFF TO IMPOSE FINES FOR NATURAL GAS VIOLATIONS. FROM PROCESS ALLOWS THE CPU STATE TO ACT QUICKLY CITATIONS MAY ARISE OUT OF AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO RELATED MATTERS FOR ONE OF ISOLATION AS PRODUCT TO THE CPC'S ATTENTION DIRECTLY. FOR MORE AGREE JUST FOR WIDESPREAD VIOLATIONS THE CPC MAY OPEN ORDER INSTITUTED INVESTIGATION. ON THAT INSTANT PORTION. ADDITIONALLY THIS IF YOU SEE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE NTSB AND FILMS ARE ESTABLISHED MANDATORY TRAINING FOR ALL STATE GAS SYSTEM INSPECTORS TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CPUC ARE STAFFED WITH QUALIFIED INFORMED INSPECTORS. WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE LEGISLATOR. THE GAS SAFETY RELIABILITY BRANCH HAS GROWN FROM A SECTION OF TWELVE AT THE TIME OF SAN BRUNO TO AN OPERATIONAL BRANCH OF FORTY FOUR. THIS GROWTH HAS ADDED VITAL STAFF POSITIONS TO BETTER MONITOR AND ENSURE THE SAFE SAFETY INTEGRITY OF THE GAS UTILITY SYSTEM THESE POSITIONS INCLUDE VITAL INSPECTOR UNDER ENGINEERS AS WELL AS POLICY AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT INSURANCE USER BE INSPECTORS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED EQUIPPED AND DEPLOYED DEPLOYED. AND PROVIDING EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT OF GAS INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WHAT THE ADDITIONAL GAS STAFF SAFETY STAFF AND INTENSIVE TRAINING THE CPC HAS ISSUED STAFF CITATIONS EXCEEDING FIFTY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. GAS GAS FUTURE IS A THING CALIFORNIA MANY CITATIONS BEING IDENTIFIED PRIOR TO A SAFETY INCIDENT OCCURRING. IS CONSIST OF TWENTY SEVEN STAFF LEVEL CITATIONS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE INCLUDING SEVENTEEN TO P. JEANNIE AND FIVE TO SOCALGAS. ADDITIONALLY THE CPC HAS ISSUED SAFETY CITATIONS THAT ENCOMPASS MOBILE HOME PARK OPERATORS LOOKING TO MARK PROGRAMS AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ALL ADDING TO THE GOAL OF IDENTIFYING SAFETY CONCERNS BEFORE AN INCIDENT OCCURS. A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THE CPC'S CAPACITY TO INCREASE EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT OF REGULATED GAS UTILITIES IS THE ONE HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FINE THAT WAS IMPOSED ON P. JEANNIE IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY AS A RESULT OF THE LOGIN MARC INVESTIGATION. HE FOUND THAT PG&amp;E UNDERCOUNTED NUMEROUS LOCATE. NUMEROUS LATE LOCATED MARC TICKETS OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS AND THAT PG&amp;E REPORTED INACCURATE COUNTS OF THIS LATE LOW PMR TICKETS THE CPUC. PINE CREEK STAFFING CITATION AMOUNTS MAY DEMONSTRATE THAT WE NOW HAVE A MORE ACTIVE PRESENCE IN THE FIELD THE TRUE MEASURE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROGRAMS IMPROVEMENTS REST IN THE DETAILS OF WHAT TYPES OF VIOLATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE GAS THE GENERAL RELIABILITY BRANCH HAS RECORDED AN OVERALL DECREASE IN SIGNIFICANT SAFETY VIOLATIONS. SUCH AS FEWER INJURIES FATALITIES AND MAJOR DAMAGES. BUT EVEN WITH ALL THESE MEASURES SUCH AS INCREASED STAFFING INCREASED INSPECTION CYCLES CITATIONS INTERNAL AUDIT AND OPERATIONAL TRAINING WAIT TO SEE IF YOU SEE REFUSE TO BECOME COMPLACENT WATER IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. THERE'S ALSO THE FACT THAT WE LIVE IN A DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE STATE'S POPULATION CONTINUES TO GROW INFRASTRUCTURE CONTINUES TO AGE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE REMINDS US OF OUR VULNERABILITIES AND THE NEED TO BE MORE RESILIENT. THE GAS THE GENERALIZED BRANCH WITHIN THE P. YOU. CONTINUES TO EXPLORE NEW MECHANISMS TO ADVANCE OUR AUDIT AND INSPECTION CAPABILITIES WHILE BUILDING STRONG AND RESILIENT WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH THE GAS SYSTEM OPERATORS AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. I'M CLOSE BY CIRCLING BACK TO THE REMEMBER TO STAMP IN OUR OWN TRAGEDY AND ECHO THE SENTIMENT BUT THAT CENTER HILL MADE DURING THE C. P. C. VOTING MEETING CUSTOMER TAPPED. THE EXPLOSION DID NOT AND DOES NOT DEFINE OUR COMMUNITIES STRENGTHENED US. DESCRIBED TO MENTION IT TO ENSURE A TRAGEDY LIKE SAN. BRUNO EXPLOSION NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. JUST BELONG TO ONE OF THE DAY OR- INSTEAD THIS DRIVE COMES FROM ALL COMMUNITY. NOT ONLY DOES BUT TO ME STATE ALIVE WE TO. IF YOU THINK IT TO WORK THE OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHAT. AND UTILITIES OFFER TO PROVIDE A NUMBER TO COLLABORATE. BECAUSE IT WILL REQUIRE A BROAD IN ZERO EFFORT TO ENSURE ALL CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDED SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE UTILITY SERVICE. AGAIN I THANK YOU SORRY HEALTH FOR THE INVITATION AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE SUPPORT AND COLLABORATION OFFERED OVER THE PAST DECADE TO HELP US PROVIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER PALMER AND- I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT I BELIEVE THAT YOUR COMPANY BY KAREN SAYING IN THE PROGRAM MANAGER FOR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION FOR GUEST SAFETY AND RELIABILITY BRANCH SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE NICE COMMENTS. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM CRISTINA CONCERT VICE PRESIDENT AND CO LEAD OF GAS OPERATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY SILVA- THIS CULTURE TO WELCOME AND- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY WITH THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN HELEN SENATORS MY NAME IS CHRISTINE COWSERT I'M CURRENTLY THE INTERIM CO LEAD A GAS OPERATIONS AND VICE PRESIDENT OF GAS OPERATIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OPERATIONS IT P. JEANNIE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING TODAY. I HAVE BEEN WITH P. GENIE FOR NINETEEN YEARS AND SERVED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT LEADERSHIP ROLES DURING THIS TIME. AND I STARTED MY CAREER IN GAS OPERATIONS IN TWO THOUSAND ONE AND REJOIN THE GAS OPERATIONS ORGANIZATION SHORTLY AFTER THE SAN BRUNO PIPELINE EXPLODED SOLUTION. WE WILL NEVER FORGET ZAMBRANO'S TRAGEDY NOR WHAT ALL THAT WAS LOST THAT DAY. AS WITH US AS A COMPANY IN INDIVIDUALS AND INFLUENCES THE WAY WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN SAFETY EVERY DAY. WE HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY ADOPTED THE MINDSET BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY OUR WORK WILL NEVER BE DONE. AND WHILE WE'VE COME A LONG WAY WE KNOW WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO. I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER THE MOMENT I LEARNED THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAGEDY IN SAMPER NOW. AND THE REFLECTIONS FROM THAT MOMENT WILL BE WITH ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. EXPERIENCES AND LESSONS WE LEARNED FROM SAN BRUNO FUNDAMENTALLY INFLUENCE HOW WE APPROACH SAFETY IN THE OPERATION OF OUR SYSTEM. WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN AND THAT WE MUST CONTINUALLY ASSESS AND MITIGATE RISKS TO ENSURE THAT THAT'S THE CASE. I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS TO IMPROVED SYSTEM OPERATIONS AND SAFETY WITHIN GAS OPERATIONS AT PG&amp;E. AS MAYOR MEDINA MENTIONED IN HIS COMMENTS WE'VE UNDERTAKEN MANY EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR OPERATIONS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS. IN TWENTY ELEVEN AS PART OF OUR IMMEDIATE PLANNING TO COMPLETELY REDESIGN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS OVERSIGHT AND SAFETY CULTURE WE SUBMITTED TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE PIPELINE SAFETY ENHANCEMENT PLAN. WHICH IDENTIFIED THE WORK WE WOULD UNDERTAKE TO TRANSFORM OUR TRANS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE SYSTEM. ALL WORK OUTLINED IN THAT PLAN WAS COMPLETED LAST YEAR ONE YEAR AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. AS DR HALL STATED THE NTSB MADE TWELVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOLLOWING SAMBAR NOW ELEVEN OF WHICH HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WITH THE NTSB ACKNOWLEDGING THE STATUS OF THE TWELFTH. HYDROSTATIC HYDROSTATIC WE TESTING OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM AND ONGOING AN ACCEPTABLE. HI DANIEL UPDATES TO THE NTSB ON OUR PROGRESS ON THIS RECOMMENDATION AND ARE CURRENTLY FORECASTING THE LAST OF THE WORK TO BE COMPLETE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. EACH YEAR SINCE TWENTY TWELVE FIJI HAS SUBMITTED OUR GAS SAFETY PLAN ARE WIDE RANGING ROAD MAP THAT EXPLAINS THE MANY WAYS TEACHING IS PUTTING THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC. CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS FIRST. THIS INCLUDES THE INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESSES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH BEST PRACTICES IN THE GAS INDUSTRY. SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WE'VE ESTABLISHED THREE NEW STATE OF THE ART FACILITIES THAT ALL FOCUS ON IMPROVING SAFETY OPERATIONS AND SAFETY CULTURE. THE GAS CONTROL CENTER IN SAN RAMON WHERE WE MONITOR THE PRESSURES FLOW IN OPERATION NUMBER GAS SYSTEM TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. RBC GAS SAFETY COUNTY IN WINTERS CALIFORNIA WHERE NEW HIRES AND EMPLOYEES RECEIVE SAFETY TRAINING AS IT RELATES TO THEIR JOB DUTIES. AND THE CENTER FOR GAS EIGHTEEN INNOVATION IN DUBLIN CALIFORNIA WHERE AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS WE CAN CONDUCT SAFETY TRAINING. TESTING ASSESSMENTS AND CALIBRATION OF EQUIPMENT FOR USE IN OUR NATURAL GAS SYSTEM. AS WE WORK TO REBUILD OUR GAS SYSTEM AND RECREATE THE WAYS WE DO WORK. WE SOUGHT OUT EXAMPLES OF OTHER INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT SAFETY INCIDENTS. AND WHAT THEY DID TO RESTRUCTURE THEIR SAFETY CULTURE INCLUDING AVIATION AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES AND WE ADOPTED MANY OF THEIR BEST PRACTICES. WE ALSO LOOKS TO OUR DIABLO CANYON NUCLEAR FACILITY WILL WHICH SAW SUCCESSFUL UTILIZATION OF A TOOL THAT ALLOWED EMPLOYEES TO RAISE SAFETY CONCERNS. THAT TOOL THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PROGRAM WE'RE CAP. HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED IN GAS OPERATIONS AND IS NOW ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT SUPPORTS OUR COMPANYWIDE SPEAK UP CULTURE. IN ADDITION TO THE EXTENSIVE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE DONE OVER THE LAST DECADE TO TRANSFORM THE PHYSICAL OPERATIONOF OUR ASSETS. WE ALSO EXTENSIVELY REDESIGNED OUR RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. GAS OPERATIONS THIS MEANT TO COMPLETE REVIEW OUR PHYSICAL RECORDS DIGITIZING THEM AND IMPROVING UPON AREAS WERE RECORDS MAY HAVE BEEN INSUFFICIENT. ONE OF THE FIRST PROJECTS WE SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH AFTER SAN BRUNO WASN'T GPS SURVEY KNOWN AS OUR CENTER ONE SURVEY OF OUR ENTIRE TRANSMISSION PIPELINE SYSTEM. THAT WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY THIRTEEN. WE'VE ALSO CONSOLIDATED MORE THAN FOUR MILLION RECORDS RELATED TO OUR TRANSMISSION PIPELINES FROM NEARLY SIXTY FIELD OFFICES. ACROSS OUR SERVICE AREA INTO AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE IMPROVED RECORDS IN REAL TIME MONITORING OF OUR SYSTEM HAVE ALLOWED US TO QUICKLY RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES JUST SITUATIONS AND QUICKLY ISOLATE GAS SUCH AS THE THIRD PARTY DICKENS THAT HAPPENED IN BAKERSFIELD AND FRESNO IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN ORDER TO TRULY CHANGE HOW WE APPROACH THE SAFE AND RELIABLE DELIVERY OF NATURAL GAS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. IN TWENTY TWELVE WE ESTABLISHED OUR SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR GAS OPERATIONS WHICH WE CALL GAS SAFETY EXCELLENCE. YES THEY DO EXCELLENCE FOCUSES ON SAFETY CULTURE PROCESS SAFETY AND ASSET MANAGEMENT IT STRIVES TO ENABLE EMPLOYEES TO DO THE WORK THE RIGHT WHAT DO THE WORK RIGHT THE FIRST TIME TO DELIVER HIGH VALUE QUALITY SERVICES. I ALSO EIGHTY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF IT. HAVING GAS INDIA EXCELLENCE IN PLACE IS NOT THE END GOAL IS THE WAY WE ENSURE WE GET BETTER AT HOW WE OPERATE IN MANAGER BUSINESS BY PUTTING SAFETY AT THE CENTER OF OUR WORK. AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW OTHERS RATED OUR PROGRESS. WE SOUGHT THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION OF OUR WORK FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. AND RECEIVED A MAINTAIN SORT OF CERTIFICATE SUCH AS- API ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE. EIGHTY AYE AYES SEVEN FIFTY FOUR. I SAW A FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE AND PASSED FIFTY FIVE. MANY OF THE LEARNINGS AND SUCCESSES FROM THIS ARE BEING APPLIED AND CONSIDERED COMPANYWIDE P. JEANNIE INCLUDING ADOPTING AYE SO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE AND OTHER BEST IN CLASS INDUSTRY STANDARDS. I WANT TO CONCLUDE MY OPENING REMARKS BY SAYING THIS. WE DEEPLY REGRET THE TRAGIC EXPLOSION THAT HAPPENED IN SAMBAR NOW WHICH RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF LIFE. MULTIPLE INJURIES AND DAMAGE TO PROPERTY IN THE COMMUNITY ITSELF. I KNOW PERSONALLY THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT DAY I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES AND FELLOW WORKERS NOT FORGET IT EITHER. NOR WILL WE FORGET THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT INFLUENCES THE DECISIONS WE MAKE EVERY DAY. FOR ALL NEW HIRES TALKING ABOUT THE PIPELINE EXPLOSION AS PART OF THEIR ON BOARDING WITH THE COMPANY. AND FOR GAS EMPLOYEES WHO TRAIN AT OUR GAS SAFETY ACADEMY IN WINTERS. THE DAMAGE SECTION OF THE GAS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE IS ON DISPLAY TO SERVE AS A STARK REMINDER THAT EVERY ACTION WE TAKE HAS CONSEQUENCES AND THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. THESE AND OTHER CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE AROUND ABOUT CIMBRIAN ARE TO ENSURE THAT. TO ENSURE WE PUTSAFETY FIRST AND ALL OUR DECISIONS AND ACTIONS. THIS IS TRUE FOR ME FOR THE FIVE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND GAS OPERATIONS AND THE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AT PG&amp;E WHO SHARE THE MISSION TO DELIVER ENERGY SAFELY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS CULTURED AND UP. THE I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO VISIT THE GRAND OPENING OR THE- THE CEREMONY AT THE OPENING OF THE WINTERS TRAINING FACILITY. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE TRAINING THE THAT'S INVOLVED NOW AND ALL GAS- AND IN NEW EMPLOYEES- GAS AND ELECTRIC EMPLOYEES AND I DID WITNESS AND SAW THAT- THAT PIPE FROM SAN BRUNO. ALSO I THOUGHT IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT TO HEAR. THAT PRIOR TO THAT TRAINING FACILITY WINTERS WHICH I THOUGHT WAS- A SUPERFICIAL ME WE WENT THROUGH- THE ENTIRE OPERATION AND- ALL OF THE DIFFERENT- LEVELS OF TRAINING AND- STATIONS OF TRAINING THE PEOPLE WOULD WITNESS AND- THAT WOULD GO THROUGH DURING THE TRAINING BUT THE PART THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT AND I THINK WHICH- HOPEFULLY SHOWS AND I THINK DOES INDICATE. P. GENIES CHANGE. IN WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO DO AND HOW THEY TRAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR THE FUTURE IS. I WAS- ADVISED BY YOUR VICE PRESIDENT AT THE TIME- THAT- PRIOR TO THAT- FACILITY NEW EMPLOYEES WERE BASICALLY TRAINED ON THE JOB. IT WAS ON THE JOB TRAINING WITH NO FORMAL TRAINING FOR GAS SYSTEMS OR ELECTRIC SYSTEMS AND NOW THAT IS A ONE WEEK OPERATION AND TRAINING SO I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT. THE CUSTOMERS OF PG&amp;E- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT COULD WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING- AND THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY TODAY- WILL NOW MOVE TO OUR FINAL PRESENTER. AT THE ANA NG DIRECTOR PROGRAM MANAGEMENT FOR- OFFICE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS MISSING THANK YOU. THANK YOU THERE. HER PARTNERS WE WANT TO EXTEND OUR CONDOLENCES TO MAYOR MEDINA AND ALL THE FAMILIES FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES IMPACTED BY THE SEMPURNA I PLAY RUPTURE. I SO ELOQUENTLY EXPRESSED BY THE CPUC. THE DEPTH OF THIS TRAGEDY IS THE SOURCE OF OUR RESOLVE TO TAKE ALL ACTIONS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. WE JOIN YOU TODAY TO REFLECT UPON THIS TRAGEDY AND REPORT BACK THE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN TO ENSURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THANK YOU SENATOR HELD FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINE SAFETY FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT. AND FOR INVITING US TO JOIN YOU HERE TODAY. IT IS OUR PRIVILEGE AND HONOR TO PROVIDE TWENTY TWO MILLION CUSTOMERS. WITH SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ENERGY TO FUEL THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY. OUR EMPLOYEES COME TO WORK EACH DAY GLAD TO BE OF SERVICE PROUD TO PROVIDE SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND PRIVILEGED THAT WE'VE BEEN ENTRUSTED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO STATE OUR SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. THANKS TO THE TIRELESS EFFORTS AND STEADFAST COMMITMENT OF SENATOR HILL AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FOLLOWING THE TRAGIC EXPLOSION ON SEPTEMBER NINTH TWENTY TEN. CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE INDUSTRY IN THE NATION AND TRANSMISSION PIPELINE SAFETY. I'VE SOCALGAS MST JEANNIE WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE STATE'S LEADERSHIP AND FOR EMPOWERING US TO NOT ONLY IMPLEMENT INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES BUT TO INNOVATE AND DRIVE CHANGES THAT WOULD TAKE THE INDUSTRY EVEN FURTHER. PRIOR TO NUMBER NOW WE HAD ALREADY MADE SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY LEADING INVESTMENTS IN OUR SYSTEM TO ENHANCE THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF OUR PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE I REDUCE EMISSIONS AND DRIVE TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENT IN THE pTHE NINETEEN NINETIES WE IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM TO REPLACE ALL CAST IRON IN OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. BY NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WE WERE PROUD TO REPORT THAT NO CASTING REMAINED IN OUR SYSTEM WHICH NOT ONLY ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF OUR DISTRIBUTION SERVICE ALSO REDUCE EMISSIONS. PRIOR TO TWENTY TEN WE HAD ALSO INVESTED IN ADVANCING IN LINE INSPECTION TECHNOLOGY AND RETROFITTING OUR PIPELINES TO MAKE IMPECCABLE. BY TWENTY TEN WE HAD ALREADY RETROFITTED APPROXIMATELY 50% OF OUR TRANSMISSION PIPELINES TO ENABLE IN LINE INSPECTION. THE REMAINING PIPELINES DUE TO NON STANDARD HIGH PLANE DIAMETERS DIAMETER CHANGES PRE WAR WAR TO FABRICATION METHODS ARE FITTING TYPES POSE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO MAKE FOOTBALL. WE DIDN'T STOP THERE HOWEVER WE PARTNERED WITH INNOVATIVE COMPANIES ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO ENHANCE THE CAPABILITY OF EXISTING IN LINE INSPECTION TOOLS TO ASSESS HIGH POINTS WITH A WIDER RANGE OF ADVOCATES. FEDERAL REGULATIONS AT THE TIME LAPSED SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION TO PIPELINE OPERATORS REGARDING WHETHER TO AUTOMATE TRANSMISSION PIPELINE VALVES. BY TWENTY TEN WE HAD ALREADY AUTOMATED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS THROUGHOUT OUR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. FOLLOWING WE ASKED OURSELVES HOW CAN WE DO BETTER. HOW CAN WE SUPPORT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CPC'S RESOLUTE DETERMINATION TO ENSURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THANKS TO SENATOR HELL AND THE CPC'S LEADERSHIP. WE WERE AUTHORIZED TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL SAFETY INVESTMENTS. HAS TO REPLACE ALL PIPELINE SEGMENTS WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION OF THE POST CONSTRUCTION PRESSURE TEST. WHEN WE FIRST FILED OUR PIPELINE SAFETY ENHANCEMENT PLAN IN RESPONSE TO THE CPC AND STATE LEGISLATURES DIRECTIVES. WE ESTIMATED THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PASS A REPLACE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILES OF TRANSMISSION PIPELINES IN CLASS THREE AND FOUR LOCATIONS AND HIGH CONSEQUENCE AREAS. FOLLOWING FOR THEIR REVIEW OF HISTORIC TYPE MY RECORDS WE DETERMINE THE MILEAGE THE LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES. WE WERE ALSO OPERATES REPLACE ALL REMAINING TYPE INSTALLED PRIOR TO NINETEEN FORTY SIX. THAT WE HAD FAR BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE A COUPLE. TO DATE WE HAVE REPLACED TWENTY SEVEN MILES OF PRE NINETEEN FORTY SIX PIPE WITH NEW PIPELINE MANUFACTURE MODERN STANDARDS UNDER THIS AUTHORITY. WE WERE ALSO AUTHORIZED TO PRESSURE TEST ALL HIGH PLAINS TO AT LEAST ONE POINT TWO FIVE TIMES THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE. EVEN THOUGH FEDERAL REGULATIONS AT THE TIME ALLOWED PIPELINE OPERATORS TO PRESSURE TEST TO A ONE POINT ONE TIMES AND MIELKE THRESHOLD IN CLASS ONE LOCATION. FOLLOWING CALIFORNIA'S LEAD FEDERAL REGULATIONS WERE CHANGED AND NOW ALSO REQUIRE ONE POINT TWO FIVE TIMES MAO KIEFER TYPE PLANS AS WELL. IN ADDITION WE RECEIVED APPROVAL TO AUTOMATE HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL MAINLINE VALVES AND ENHANCE THE AUTOMATION OF EXISTING ABOUT TO ENABLE RAPID REMOTE ISOLATION OF TRANSMISSION PIPELINES IN THE EVENT OF A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN PRESSURE. WE ALSO RECEIVED SUPPORT FOR AN INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY PLAN WHICH INCLUDED PURPLE PROPOSALS TO INSTALL FIBER OPTIC CABLES TO DETECT BROWN MOVEMENT AND IDENTIFY POTENTIAL THIRD PARTY DAMAGE. WARNING MASHUP OF PIPELINES TO PREVENT THIRD PARTY DAMAGE AND NOTHING DETECTORS NEAR CRITICAL FACILITIES. MOST RECENTLY THE C. P. C. AUTHORIZED US TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO TEST A REPLACE PIPELINES PRESSURE TESTED PRIOR TO THE EXISTENCE OF MODERN PRESSURE TESTING STANDARDS. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. MOREOVER IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING OUR COMPREHENSIVE PIPELINE SAFETY ENHANCEMENT PLAN. THE COMMISSION HAS SUPPORTED OUR EFFORT TO ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AS WELL. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE REPLACED OVER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED MILES OF DISTRIBUTION PIPELINE. FURTHER ENHANCING THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES AND REDUCING EMISSIONS. WE'VE ALSO CONVERTED OVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS TO DIRECT UTILITY SERVICE. ENHANCING THE SAFETY RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF SERVICE FOR THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS MANY OF WHOM ARE NOW ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CARE AND MEDICAL BASELINE PROGRAM. I WILL CONCLUDE MY PREPARED REMARKS BY ONCE AGAIN THANKING THIS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN HELL AND THE C. P. C. FOR YOUR AND DURING COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AYE FOR TAKING IMMEDIATE ACTION FOLLOWING THE TRAGEDY IN SAMBAR NOW. TO PROPEL CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE NATION IMPACT MY SAFETY AND INNOVATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FISHING APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND- I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE REALLY AND WHEN YOU REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS- FROM TEN YEARS AGO TO TODAY. YOU KNOW I FIND THAT THE UTILITIES AND THE REGULATOR HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS- YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY. AND YOU REALLY SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND- CERTAINLY THE YOUR COMPANY SHOULD BE PROUD AND CERTAINLY THE STATE SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE PROUD AS A REGULATOR. OF THE INDUSTRY BUT- I KNOW THAT THAT- PRIDE SHOULD SPUR YOU TO DO EVEN MORE HOPEFULLY- TO BE BETTER. NOT TO RESTER FIELD SATISFIED IN WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SAFETY IS NOT STATIC AND- SO WE CANNOT BE STATIC IN THAT IN THE N. T. S. B. O. DIRECTOR PALMER OF A QUESTION TO YOU- DEFEATED WE COULD RETURN TO. THE CONVERSATION- IN THIS IS RELATED TO THE- NTSB MASSACHUSETTS EXPLOSION- IN THE FIRST PANEL THE FOLLOWING THE GAS EXPLOSIONS DID THE CPUC RESPOND TO THAT URGENT RECOMMENDATION. THAT WAS GIVEN TO THEM. SHARKS AND ALSO CONTROL COMING OFF NEW TECHNOLOGICALLY. M. AND RESPONSE TO THE RIGHT OR THE EVENT ITSELF- WE MERELY AT THE PC AND WITHIN THE CAST IF YOU'RE A LIABILITY BRANCH THE ENEMY TO LOOKING AT THAT EVENT AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THE COFFEE WERE NOT PART OF THE INVESTIGATION BUT LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED YOU KNOW WHAT WE GET OUT OF THAT AND LOOKING AT OUR OWN INTERNAL PROCESSES AS WELL AS OUR GENERAL ORDERS TO SEE DID WE HAVE ANY IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIABLE. GAPS THAT WAS RIGHT OFF THE BAT SO OF WHICH I A S. LOOK AT. AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL P. IN TERMS OF HAVING IT STAMPED WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THAT TIME WE ARE AWARE OF THE LETTER TO AND TO BE SENT TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WE ARE EVALUATING THE BEST WAY FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WE ARE AS PREVIOUSLY STATED ONE TO THIRTY ONE STATES THAT DOES PROVIDE FOR THAT EXEMPTION SO WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING AT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR US TO GO FORWARD WITH THAT WHAT PROVIDES THE GREATEST LEVEL OF SAFETY FOR CALIFORNIANS AND CONSUMERS WITH IN CALIFORNIA- BUT ALSO HOW WE DIRECT YOUR- S. INSURER. WE CAN FOR SAID AND IT WORKS FOR THE REPAIRS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU IT I KNOW YOU WERE KIND ENOUGH TO REFERENCE AB FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT EARLIER OF MY THAT WAS MY STATUTE OF TWENTY TWELVE WHICH REQUIRED A RESPONSE TO THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF RECEIPT SO I HOPE. AND I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE PC WILL LOOK AT THAT- CLOSER AS WE MOVE FORWARD. ANOTHER QUESTION CONSIDERING THE OVER PRESSURIZATION OF P. GENIES PIPES THAT CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE FOLLOWING AN BRUNO WHERE AS WE KNOW P. GENIES GAS SAFETY PLAN SHOWS ELEVEN LARGE OVER PRESSURIZATION EVENTS LAST YEAR ALONE- THE CPUC AND OTHER OTHER AND ARE YOU DO YOU. THE C. P. U. C. UTILIZES SOME INTRICATE TO INTERNALIZE LESSONS FROM THE MASSACHUSETTS EXPLOSION- SO WE LOOKS LIKE WE DID HAVE A NUMBER OF THOSE OVER PRESSURIZATION EVENT SO- TO P. JEANNIE AND N. THOSE SO CALLED GAS- IN FIRST TO SO CALLED GAS OF MISSING. OF HAVE YOU OF. THE WE DON'T HAVE MANY HOW MANY OVER PREET PRESSURIZATION EVENTS DID SO CAL GAS EXPERIENCE LAST YEAR. ARE YOU OF BUT WE'RE OF THE NUMBER. BOTH DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION LINES. I DO NOT HAVE THAT NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME BUT I WOULD GLADLY SEND YOU A WRITTEN RESPONSE FOLLOWING HEARING. AND HOW THE- SINCE THESE PIPES ARE A VINTAGE NATURE AS WE KNOW MANY OF THEM. SUCH AS THE- WIND AND- CHAMBER AND- WHICH STALLED IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. HOW ARE YOU- COMBAT IN THESE OVER PRESSURIZATION EVENTS ESPECIALLY. IN LIGHT OF THOSE AT THE AGE OF THOSE PIPES. THAT THAT IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT I PREPARED TO DISCUSS HERE TODAY- BUT I COULD DEFINITELY PROVIDE A WRITTEN RESPONSE TO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE GOING TO THE QUESTIONS I DID WANT TO. MOVE ON TO SOME- AND BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE OTHER QUESTIONS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC. THAT WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR HEARING TODAY THEY CAN CALL NOW- PLEASE DIAL THE TOLL FREE NUMBER THAT I GAVE EARLIER EIGHT FOUR FOUR. TWO NINE ONE SIX THREE SIX FOUR AND WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THIS ACCESS CODE WHICH IS. TWO EIGHT ZERO FIVE NINE TWO SEVEN ZERO THAT'S TWO EIGHT ZERO FIVE. NINE SEVEN ZERO SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET CALLS FROM THE PUBLIC TO TOUR DIRECTOR PALMER- THE LAST PANEL ALSO DISCUSSED- SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. BEING USED TO ENCOURAGE SAFETY AT THE UTILITIES I THINK WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT AND AS YOU RECALL P. GENIES LOCATE AND MARK INVESTIGATION WHICH CONCLUDED IN. JANUARY OF THIS YEAR RAISE THE ISSUES OF KIND OF PERVERSE INCENTIVES WERE THAT CD FOUND THAT FROM TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE ONE OF P. GENIES SHORT TERM FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR SUPERVISORS WAS A REDUCTION IN THE LAKE TICKETS- IN IS WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT IF THE BACKGROUND PAPER SUBMITTED FOR THIS HEARING ALSO NOTES THAT P. GENIES CURRENT. DIG IN AND STEP METRIC CAN OBSCURE ACTUAL SAFETY MEASUREMENTS AND MAY BE EASILY CO OPTED. TO WHY IS THIS NUMBER OF BEGINS AND FOUR THOUSAND TICKETS AN APPROPRIATE METRICS IT'S BEING USED AND DOES THIS RAISE ANY CONCERN ABOUT. THE INCENTIVES CURRENTLY IN PLACE. I THANK CHAIRMAN FOR THE QUESTION. IN TERMS OF THE INCENTIVE I'LL ADDRESS THAT FIRST. THE DIRECTOR OF ESTUDIANTES SPEAKING FOR MYSELF- I AM NOT. IN FAVOR OF THE CENTERS ARE I'LL BE UP FRONT I BELIEVE THAT I WOULD BE WAS DR- PAUL NEWMAN FROM AND THAT YOU KNOW POINTED OUT THERE'S A BIG FOSTER THAT ARE DEFINITELY PROPOSED TO INCENTIVIZING. SAFETY VIA A- A MONETARY VALUE- SAFETY IS A CULTURE AT THE STATE OF MIND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU LIVE WITH FOR AND YOU RESET AND IT MIGHT BE FOR VARIOUS REASONS BUT IT IS A CULTURE THAT YOU HAVE TO HARNESS. AND FACILITATE WITH THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION AND AS SUCH YOU NEED TO ENSURE AND THIS IS WHAT WE TRY TO DO WITH AN STD IT'S FREE TRY TO DECIDE YOURSELF STRUCTURE OUR DIFFERENT LINES OF BUSINESS. JUST LIKE SOME THE UTILITIES HAVE DONE OR SPEAKING WITH EACH OTHER AND LEARNING THIS VALUABLE LESSONS FROM EACH OTHER- WE DON'T HAVE AN INCENTIVE ON THE REGULATOR SIDE FOR ISSUE MORE CITATIONS ARE FINDING MORE STUFF. THERE IS NO INCENTIVE FOR THAT AND MONETARILY OR INCENTIVE AS WELL WE KNOW WHAT IF WE GO OUT THERE AND FIND NOTHING. THAT'S A GREAT DAY THAT'S A GREAT DAY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY ENFORCE THEIR DAY ARE LIVING UP TO SAFETY STANDARDS. I MISS THE DAYS THAT WE DO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS A CONCERNING DAY AND ONLY SO THE QUESTION DOES THE SAFETY CULTURE EXIST WITHIN THAT ORGANIZATION IS A COMING FROM THE TOP DOWN. OR IS IT STARTING AT THE BOTTOM WORKING ITS WAY HALF WAY UP AND THEN SUDDENLY BEING STOPPED BY IN THIS CASE LOCAL MARKET USE YOUR EXAMPLE- AND INSTEAD WHERE. SOMEBODY WAS TO YOU THAT FOR NOW AND TO. YOU KNOW MEET AND- ON THAT'S WHAT LED TO THE BY. THAT'S WHAT TO CORRECT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THAT. AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OF LOCATING MARC PROGRAM WITHIN P. JEANNIE TO CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE BEING PUT IN PLACE WHICH DOES INCLUDE. A OUTSIDE CONSULTANT TO BOTH MARTYRED A LOGIN MARC PROGRAM AND THE SAFETY CULTURE. THANK YOU MISTER PALMER. AND I NOTICED THAT SENATOR STERN HAS A QUESTION BUT I DID WANT TO JUST FINISH THIS TRANSPORT- AND THIS QUESTION DIRECTOR NG- YOU- SODA DOES. THE SO CAL GAS AND- ESTY GENIE USE THE SAME METRIC AS P. JEANNIE TO MEASURE D. AND SAFETY- AND IS IT LIKE WHY IS TIED TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION PER SE I CAN'T SPEAK IN DETAIL ABOUT HOW THE GENIE QUANTIFIES ITS METRICS BUT WE DEFINITELY TRACK. AND MONITOR ARE LOCATED MARC METRICS BECAUSE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT SAFETY METRICS- THAT WILL FOCUS ON THE SAFETY OF OUR SYSTEM ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES- WE DO HAVE. THE SAFETY METRICS THAT WE TRACK FOR OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION I CAN'T SIT HERE TODAY AND TELL YOU EXACTLY WHETHER THERE IS ONE FOR THAT BUT- I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO FOCUS FONG. AND I AND I WILL SAY I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE FOCUS ON THIS BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTANT REST OF PIPELINE SAFETY. IF YOU ARE TO HAVE. A DIG IN BY A THIRD PARTY YOU KNOW AND I AGREE WITH THAT HOWEVER IS P. JEANNIE FOUND THAT THEIR METRIC AND THEY THEIR USE OF. OF THAT INCENTIVE- IN THE PERVERSE NATURE OF THAT ALLOWED THEM TO. JUST IT WAS A NUMBERS GAME RATHER THAN A QUALITY GAME TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE WORK WAS ACTUALLY DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER. IN ORDER TO MEET IT SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS HOW HAVE YOU TAKEN. THE NECESSARY STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALONG THAT PROCESS THAT THERE IS A COMPLETE. MEASUREMENT AND DYNAMIC WITH THE METRIC SO THAT IT IS ACCURATELY REFLECTING A SAFE AND A THOROUGH PROCESS- BEFORE THE. INCENTIVE IS PAID OR GIVEN. THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION I WILL SAY. THAT DOCTOR SHERMAN MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF A STRONG SAFETY CULTURE AND THE DYNAMICS OF PEOPLE. AND AT SO CAL GAS WE HAVE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THAT COME TO WORK EVERY DAY. HONOR TO SAFEGUARD THE SAFETY OF OUR SYSTEM AND COMMITTED TO THAT AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER ACTUALLY LIES IN A STRONG SAFETY CULTURE WHERE WE FOCUS ON. ACTING OUR FELLOW EMPLOYEES AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND PRIORITIZE THAT ARE ACTUALLY MAKE UP THE FOUNDATION ABOVE ALL ELSE AND THAT'S OUR CULTURE AT SOCALGAS. THANK YOU- SENATORS TURN. HEY MISTER CHAIR Q. WE SHOULD NOT CREATE A LINE OF QUESTIONING I WAS GOING TO FOLLOW UP. SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO- THE STATE OF THE SYSTEM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I TOOK A FEW NOTES DURING MISSING YOUR TESTIMONY BUT- DID I THINK YOU SAID THERE WAS THAT THERE WERE A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES LEFT OF PIPELINE AND THAT ARE DUE TO BE REPLACED I GET THAT RIGHT. ACTUALLY WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO WAS. WHEN WE INITIALLY FILED OUR PLAN WE HAD TO RAPIDLY RUBIO. DECADES OF PAPER RECORDS AND WE INITIALLY HAD A HIGHER ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF PIPELINES IN CLASS THREE AND FOUR LIKE LOCATIONS IN HIGH CONSEQUENCE AREAS THOSE ARE THE CRITERIA SET FORTH. IN THE NTSB SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOLLOWING SUMMER NOW. WE INITIALLY HAD A HIGHER ESTIMATE AND ONCE WE TOOK ADDITIONAL TIME TO REVIEW OUR RECORDS. WE HAD ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES REMAINING. AND HOW MANY OF THOSE MILES HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO REPAIR. INSTEAD SINCE RECEIVING PERCENT UPDATING YOUR YOUR REVIEW. IT'S WELL OVER A HUNDRED MILES I COULD GET YOU THE EXACT NUMBER AFTER THE MEETING GIVE OR TAKE- ABOUT FIFTY MILES AND THEY'D PROBABLY LESS THAN THAT OF THE REMAINING CLASS THREE OR FOUR- CANDIDATES FOR UPGRADE. CORRECT OKAY AND BUT THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE I WAS GOING TO ASK HIM THAT LINE TO THIRTY FIVE TWO- WHICH RUPTURED IN A MORE REMOTE AREA AS WELL AS THE I THINK IT WAS LINE FOUR THOUSAND THAT WAS TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE SUBSEQUENTLY AND THEN LINE THREE THOUSAND THAT DURING THAT REPAIR PROCESS WAS ALSO. REDUCED CAPACITY ARE THOSE KINDS OF LARGER TRUNK LINES NOT WITHIN THAT. THAT CLASS. THREE FOR ANALYSIS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE IMAGE ABOUT MILEAGE BE OUTSIDE OF HIGH CONSEQUENCE AREAS IN MORE RULE REGIONS AT THE HELP WAIT UNDERSTANDING OF THE PIPELINE MAY HAVE FANS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF HIGH CONSEQUENCE AREAS AND THEN HAVE AREAS THAT ARE WITHIN HIGH CONSEQUENCE AREAS BUT YOU'RE CORRECT THAT. I POINT IN LESS POPULATED AREAS WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THAT FIGURE. GOT IT AND DO YOU. DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT OF WHAT THE RATE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN OF THOSE. THOSE VARIOUS REPAIR PROJECTS. SORT OF CLASS THREE AND FOUR PLUS THE LARGER TRUNK LINES IN THE RURAL AREAS- FOUR SEVERAL SINCE YOU KNOW SINCE WHEN DID IT RUPTURE- TWENTY SEVENTEEN I THINK IS ONE LINE TO THIRTY FIVE RUPTURED YOU KNOW HOW MUCH. RATE PAYER- IMPACT THOSE IS AHEAD. WE PREPARE RATE IMPACT ANALYSES WHEN WE SUBMIT APPLICATIONS FOR REVIEW OF THE COSTS THAT WE RECORD I CAN PULL UP THOSE NUMBERS FROM THE PUBLIC FILINGS AND PROVIDE ON YOUR OFFICE. BE GREAT- DO YOU HAVE A SENSE THOUGH JUST AS A ROUND NUMBERS ARE WE TALKING MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS BILLIONS. IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT THAT WE'VE INVESTED IN HIGH POINT INFRASTRUCTURE. SAFETY ENHANCEMENTS FOLLOWING NUMBER NOW IT IS OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. AND RIGHT IN ADDITION TO THE ENHANCEMENTS THOUGH THE REDUCE CAPACITY. IN THOSE LINES DURING REPAIR AND THAT'S REALLY BEEN AN AREA OF MY CONCERN IS THE IS THE REPAIR PROCESS OF TWO THIRTY FIVE TWO ONE FOUR THOUSAND- TOOK SO LONG. AND WE'RE GOING INTO ANOTHER WINTER SEASON HERE WE'RE WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE THOSE STORIES ARE THE SAME COLD SNAPS MY SENSE WAS IN ADDITION TO THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT WERE. BASED ON APPROVED BY THE P. YOU SEE THERE ARE ALSO- ACTUAL GAS SUPPLY COSTS BREAKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT IS THAT. IT DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF THOSE NUMBERS. I DO NOT WE DO HOWEVER NEED TO TAKE FINDS OUT OF SERVICE TO MAINTAIN THEM AND THAT IS PART OF OPERATING IN NATURAL GAS SYSTEM. I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF REDUCED CAPACITY WILL REDUCE THE PRESSURE ON A PIPELINE TO CREATE A LARGER MARGIN OF SAFETY OR WHEN WE REMOVE THEM HI PLANE TO DO NECESSARY ASSESSMENT WORK I DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF THAT. INCREMENTAL COSTS. GOT IT AND I KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT THE C. P. U. C. WAS WAS TRACKING. THAT ADDITIONAL COST ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THAT TO THIRTY FIVE REPAIR TOOK- MISTER PALMER DO YOU DO YOU KNOW WHERE IS YOUR DIVISION. AWARE OF THAT SORT OF STUFF INCREMENTAL. ADDITIONAL COST. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE STATE IMPORTANT DIVISION NO WE DO NOT TRACK THAT I DON'T BEGIN TO DIVERSION BUT I AM HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THEM AND FIND OUT FROM MARS YOU KNOW. WHAT'S COMING UP SO. CREATE THAT- TO DO- ACTOR MISSING JUST VERY HERE DO YOU DO YOU ANTICIPATE ANY FURTHER MAJOR- OUTAGES IN SERVICE OR- AND PREPARE EVENTS GOING INTO THIS WINTER SEASON. WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO AVOID. OUTAGES DURING A PEAK. TO PEAK NEED. I CARE IF I DID KNOW OF AN OUTAGE BY THE WAY I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DISCLOSE IT PUBLICLY BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE MARKET SENSITIVE BUT- WE DO DO WHAT WE CAN TO AVOID THAT DURING PEAK MONTHS. OKAY BUT SO BUT- YOU CAN'T CONCLUSIVELY SAY THAT THERE ARE NO MAJOR REPAIRS BEING PLANNED FOR THE COMING MONTHS. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY BUT I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW IF AND I. THINK WE ALL KNEW TO THIRTY FIVE WAS OUT AND WAS TAKING A LONG TIME AND- I'VE GOT MY OWN OPINIONS ABOUT WHY IT TOOK SO LONG AND- A BACK AND FORTH IT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN YOU ALL OVER STREAMBED ALTERATION PERMITS. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN AVOID IT- THOSE DELAYS AND THE COST IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE DELAYS IN THE FUTURE- SO I RECOGNIZE THAT'S NOT DIRECTLY A SAFETY ISSUE IT'S MORE THAN RATE IMPACTS OF THIS SAFETY ISSUE BUT I WOULD JUST APPRECIATE IF YOU GUYS HAD. ANY DATA ABOUT THAT INCREMENTAL COST FACTOR AND MISTER PALMER THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THAT- I KNOW COMMISSIONER RANDOLPH HAD BEEN TRACKING THIS IS PART OF THE ELITE SO CANYON PROCEEDING- AND SO THAT HOPEFULLY THE PC IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT- I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS OF AUTHORIZED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EXPENDITURES TO PERFORM UPGRADES- FOR PIPING AND EQUIPMENT FOR LEAD MANAGEMENT. AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ACTUALLY MONEY WELL SPENT SO I'M I'M I THINK IT'S SMART TO BE NVESTING RATE PAYER DOLLARS IN THE SAFETY WORK BUT THE- DELAYS IN THAT WORK AND THE TIMING OF IT I'M ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE SEASONS WERE GAS CAN BE SHORT- DURING THE WINTERS IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR ME SO- HOW TO MARRY THOSE SORT OF RATE. SENSITIVITIES WITH THE SORT OF PRIMARY MISSION OF THIS SAFETY DIVISION I THINK I WILL I JUST I WOULD LIKE TO. GET OUR HEADS WRAPPED AROUND. THAT IF WE COULD GOING FORWARD. ACTUALLY SENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INSIGHT AND I WOULD BE SORT BACK WITH ENERGY TO ENSURE THAT WE GET YOU SOLID ANSWER ON. BRITISH BEFORE AS LONG AS SHE HAVE MOST OF. AND APPRECIATE THAT WE SHOULD BETTER WELL ABOARD WERE VERY VERY THAT'S REAL HAVE YOUR- AND TAKING. THAT ATTITUDE. MILITARY STYLE ADS YU'RE GETTING YOUR SIX AND REALLY. LOOK AFTER YOUR FELLOW PEOPLE AND LOOKING AFTER CULTURE IN THAT CONFERENCE HUESO PRESHEAF TESTIMONY TODAY AND GIVES ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE TO. SEE WHAT THE HELL MAYOR OF MY VERY LAST QUESTION MISTER CHAIR- STILL IN THIS SORT OF- THIS RETAIN IT. RIGHT I'VE BEEN. I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT RATEPAYER DOLLARS. FOR ALL THESE SAFETY WORKER BEING EXPENDED- ED SMART AND- COST EFFECTIVELY- I HAVE BEEN CONCERNED I RAISED THIS CONCERN WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. ABOUT USE OF RATEPAYER DOLLARS- FUNDING ADVOCACY EFFORTS AND SORT OF BEING DIVERTED AWAY FROM WHAT IS ACTUALLY THERE. HYPE LINE SAFETY UPGRADE WORK. TOWARDS POLITICSOR ADVOCACY- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN AN ISSUE. AROUND ONE PARTICULAR GROUP- THAT'S BEING. COVERED IN A DRESS THIS ACT I THINK IT'S CLEAN ENERGY FOR. IT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS- THAT THE GAS COMANY WAS FUNDING- AND THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS APPARENTLY INVESTIGATING- THAT ISSUE AND THAT ISSUE REST RIGHT NOW WITH. THE PRESIDENT DISPATCHER BY. ANOTHER ORGANIZATION HAS POPPED UP RECENTLY- THAT APPEARS TO ALSO BE UTILITY FUNDED- CALLED UNITED LATINOS VOTE- I'VE SEEN ADVERTISEMENTS POPPING UP- IN NEWSPAPERS ALL AROUND- VENTURA COUNTY LOS. ANGELES COUNTY. ALL THAT SOME OF IT ACTUALLY FOR EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN THE TURNED OUT A. COUNTY BY PG&amp;E PUSHING BACK ON THE CLIMATE AND- READ TRIPLE ARE AND I'M ONE. BUT FROM P. AND THE GAS COMPANY WHETHER ANY RATEPAYER DOLLARS TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE HAVE BEEN USED TO FUND THIS ORGANIZATION. THIS IS CHRISTINE HAUSER FROM P. JEANNIE I'M NOT AWARE OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND NOT AWARE OF ANY. ANY REPAIR FUNDING GOING TO FIND IT BUT HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP AND CONFIRM THAT THAT'S THE CASE OKAY THANK YOU. MISSING THANK YOU SENATOR STERN GREAT START JUST MISSING JUST CAN YOU DO NOW ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY REPAIR DOLLARS BEING SPENT TO FUND THAT ORGANIZATION I AM NOT I HAVE TO BE HONEST I HAVE NOT HEARD OF THIS ORGANIZATION BUT I WILL DEFINITELY LOOK INTO IT AS A LATINA AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I'M INTERESTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS AND ORGANIZATIONS THANKS OKAY THANKS FOR THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO. FOLLOWING UP. IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET THAT INFORMATION THANK YOU SENATOR STERN GREAT QUESTIONS FREESHEET THAT TO. TRIGGER PALMER AND- JUST YOU KNOW THE ISSUE OF. THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THE INADEQUACY OF METRICS- RAISES CONCERNS WITH THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS- ESPECIALLY BUT BROADLY WITH THE METRIC SYSTEM AB WISHED REALLY THAT THAT WE'VE SEEN TO- TO ISSUE TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE AND I KNOW IS WE TALKED ABOUT THE LOCATE MARC. THE MARKET LOOK AT THE LOCATE MARC PROGRAM AND THE CHALLENGES WITH THAT. ALBUMS THAT WERE CREATED BY THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THOSE PROBLEMS ARE STILL. WITH EVEN THE NEW PROGRAM AND METRICS THAT ARE USED THAT IT'S STILL BEING AND GAINED A LITTLE BIT SO I'M HOPING THAT- THE PUC'S LOOKING AT THAT AND MAKING SURE THAT. IT IS- NOT- BEING GAMED IN A WAY TO BROADEN THOSE INCENTIVES- UNJUSTLY WITHOUT- THE ABILITY TO REALLY VERIFY THAT SAFETY IS NOT BEING COMPROMISED IN SOME FORM SO- HOPEFULLY THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT IN THAT- P. JEANNIE IS ALSO. MANAGING THAT- THAT ASPECT COMPLETELY TO MAKE SURE SO I GUESS IN LOOKING AT THE METRICS AND WHAT WHAT IS THE REVIEW PROCESS IN THE CPUC FOR EVALUATING THE SAFETY METRICS. THANK SENT SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF DICKENS- WE CAN SET WE LOOK AT THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER. SO WE GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF AND PER WAY TO NOT JUST TICKETS SUCH AS YOUR RESIDENTS IS CALLING IN A DIFFERENT KINDS OF DECKS SO IN TERMS OF HOW WE LOOK AT A DAY AGAIN EACH ONE OF THEM IS GETTING REVIEW SO I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE VERY CLEAR ON THAT- ADDITIONALLY WITH THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS A CAME OUT OF THE VIOLATIONS WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH P. GENIE. IN SELECTING THE OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS VENDORS THAT WILL BE CONDUCTING THE FIELD AUDITS AND RECORDS AUDITS AS THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS WHICH REPORT TO US SO WE DO GET THOSE FINDINGS ARE CONSOLIDATED TO STD- IMPEACHING YEAH BELIEVE JUST ABOUT THE SAME TIME BUT I HAVE TO VERIFY THAT- SO THAT WAY WE CAN COORDINATE AND SEE IN REAL TIME WHAT THE OUTSIDE VENDORS AND CONSULTANTS ARE FINDING ON BOTH IN THE RECORDS. AND IN THE FIELD OFFICE. IT TO THE GOOD BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S OF THE EXPERT. AND CONSOLE ARE IN. REVIEW OF THE- THAT. THAT COULD BE USED TO DETERMINE IF THERE MAY BE HOLES THAT- IN THE- EFFICACY OF THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND- AND I HOPE AND NICE TO HEAR THAT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT- A QUESTION TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS NEARLY. ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM SAN BRUNO. WERE SPECIFIC TO HIGH CONSEQUENCE PIPELINES. IN THESE PIPELINES ARE IDENTIFIED AS WE ALL KNOW BASED ON THEIR PROXIMITY TO POPULATED AREAS DRINKING WATER SOURCES ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE COMPLAIN VIA MENTAL AREAS. THIS DIFFERENTIATIONBETWEEN PIPELINES MAKES IT CRITICAL TO NOT ONLY MAKE ACCURATE PIPE RECORDS TO KEEP ACCURATE RECORDS OF PIPELINE LOCATIONS BUT UPDATE THEM WITH SOME FREQUENCY. GIVEN THE LAND ABOVE THE PIPELINE IS CONSTANTLY BEING DEVELOPED THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AS I THINK WE ALL KNOW REYES TO MISS CLASSIFICATION. OF PIPELINES IS A SERIOUS ISSUE WITH SO CAL. GAS ESTY GENIE TWO YEARS AGO. OUR THE COULD. AND THE UTILITIES INSURANCE. THE RECORD KEEPING AROUND PIPELINES REMAINS UPDATED AND ACCURATE. MISTER PALMER MAY WILL START WITH YOU. I WILL GIVE THIS FROM MY ATTENTION AND THEN I MIGHT- YES MY PROGRAM AND RETURNS AND ALSO WAY AND WE HAVE SOME MORE SPECIFICS ST A FULL ANSWER US ON OUR HELP BUT I WOULD I UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERN DEAR FRIEND CHU WAS PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE- WITH REGARDS TO ENSURING THE RAPTORS MAKE UP TO DATE. WE GO EACH YEAR I BELIEVE IS NOW FIVE CYCLE INTO EACH OF OUR AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND PART OF THAT IS A RECORD AUDIT- DURING THAT RECORDS AUDIT WE ARE LOOKING A INFRASTRUCTURE MAPPING- CONSTRUCTION MAKING THEM SAYS GOING ON IN THAT. AREA RESPONSIBILITY BY THE UTILITY AT THAT TIME AND SO I GOT ONE OF THE MEASURES WE LOOK AT OUR RECORDS MAINTENANCE. AND THAT WE WOULD SEE WHAT IS THE LAST TIME THAT THEY HAVE TO DIGEST CORDON AND SEARCH OR MAPPING ITSELF OF- GAS PIPELINE'S UNDERGROUND. ON TERRACES. ANYTHING YOU WISH TO ADD TO THIS. I GET AFTER GOOD AFTERNOON A- GERMAN JAIL AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. YES WE DID DO A COMPREHENSIVE. PEACE UP INSPECTION OF PG&amp;E BACK AND I BELIEVE TWENTY FOURTEEN. WHERE WE LOOKED AT ALL OF ITS PIPELINE- SAFETY DATA. SO WE LOOKED AT BYE BYE SPECIFICATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE M. L. P. HAS BEEN VERIFIED. FOR ALL OF ITS TRANSMISSION LINES. THANK YOU YOU NEED TO THE DO YOU HAVE FOR. A COMMENTATOR ON THANK YOU SO FOR ME IN TERMS OF KEEPING OUR RECORDS UP TO DATE AND WE DO HAVE REGULAR REVIEWS OF OUR PIPELINES VIA AERIAL PATROL ON A MONTHLY BASIS IN THE SURVEY ON A SEMI ANNUAL BASIS AND- THROUGH THE CONTROL MAKE SURVEYING WE IDENTIFY ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HAVE CHANGED AROUND OUR PIPELINE SO ENCROACHMENTS OR ACTIVITY. ASSOCIATED WITH. B. ROUNDING AREA OF OUR PIPELINES IN A- WE COLLECT DATA- AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND LYFT ARE DATA TO LOOK FOR CHANGING- CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND OUR PIPELINE SYSTEM- THAT HELP US KEEP UP TO DATE IF THERE IS DEVELOPMENT IN THE AREA THAT MIGHT CHANGE- THE HIGH CONSEQUENCE AREAS STATUS OF OUR PIPELINES THAT AND THAT INFORMATION IS UPDATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND FED INTO. OUR INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN OUR RISK ANALYSIS WORK AND SO WE ARE FREQUENTLY MONITORING THAT IN ADDITION WE MONITOR THE- AS BUILT- WORK FOR MAPPING ORGANIZATION SO WHEN WORK IS COMPLETED IN THE FIELD WE MONITOR- HELLO. TO GET THE SYSTEMS OF RIGHT AT. WITH THAT INFORMATION SO WE TAKE RECORD KEEPING VERY SERIOUSLY WE SPENT YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS WE SPENT SIGNIFICANT EFFORT TO BUILD OUR SYSTEMS OF RECORD FROM THE GROUND UP AFTER SAN BRUNO AND SO. THOSE EFFORTS I MENTIONED ARE BOOKS SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE KEEP THAT INFORMATION UP TO DATE BERGER THANK YOU MISSPELLED HER. MISSING THANK YOU. IN ADDITION TO CONTINUALLY ASSESSING POPULATION GROWTH A LONGER PIPELINES MUCH- ALIGNED WITH WHAT PG&amp;E DESCRIBED. WE AT SOCALGAS HAVE TAKEN THE POSITION OF INVESTING IN ASSESSING OUR PIPELINES AND NON H. C. A.'S UNDER INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. ALL ALONG- WHEN I GAVE THAT INITIAL FIGURE FROM TWENTY TEN AND THAT SAID WE WERE- WE HAD ALREADY RETROFITTED 50% OF OUR PIPELINES TO ACCOMMODATE IN LINE INSPECTION THAT INCLUDED NON HCA. SO WHAT WE FIRMLY BELIEVE IS THAT THE SAFETY OF OUR PIPELINE IS CRITICAL AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT AND WHAT WE DO IS OFTEN- GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THE THEIR REQUIREMENTS IN HCA'S AND ALSO- PERFORM ASSESSMENTS AND NON HCA'S. MMHM WE'RE VERY GOOD THANK YOU IN THE CASE NOW CAN LOOK INTO THE FUTURE A LITTLE BIT- TO P. JEANNIE AND SOCALGAS OF. ALL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AROUND PIPELINE SAFETY ARE OCCURRING SIMULTANEOUSLY TO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT REDUCTION OR IN SOME CASES ELIMINATION OF NATURAL GAS USAGE. WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS OF NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE HOW DO WE ENSURE SAFETY IS PRIORITISED DURING DURING THIS DECADE. AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE RISKS THAT YOU FORESEE ARISING FROM THAT. THIS CONCERT A FRESH START WITH YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HEALTH. SO HE'S VERY FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE OF OUR GAS BUSINESS AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE A SAFE SYSTEM AS WE EAT SUPPORT THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS GOALS SO THE COUPLE PIECES OF OUR STRATEGY OR MAKING SURE WE'RE WE'RE MAKING THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND- PRUDENT INVESTMENTS IN OUR GAS SYSTEM TO ENSURE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT WE ARE. USING THE GAS SYSTEM AS IT EXISTS TODAY TO HELP SUPPORT- REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGH WEEK ABATEMENT FOR CAPTURING METHANE- AND LEVERAGING THAT IS RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND ULTIMATELY RESEARCH INTO HYDROGEN- AND TO DETERMINE THE WAYS THAT THE SYSTEM CAN CONTINUE TO BE USEFUL INTO THE FUTURE- AS WE LOOK AT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TRANSITION- YOU KNOW I THINK. RELIABILITY IS- SIGNIFICANT AREA FOR US TO FOCUS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOUR FIRST RANKING THE FOOTPRINT OF THE GAS SYSTEM THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A RELIABLE SYSTEM THAT CAN SERVE THE CUSTOMERS THAT ARE NOT CONTINUE TO BE SERVED BY IT AS WELL AS- OBVIOUSLY CONTINUING TO MAKE THE CURRENT SAFETY INVESTMENTS IN THE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW I THINK THE OTHER RISK THAT WE ARE EXPLORING TO TRAIN MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND IT BEFORE WE MAKE ANY TRANSITION WITH THE GAS SYSTEM IS. UNDERSTANDING. SHINTO HYDROGEN- AND SO THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESEARCH GOING ON IN THAT AREA TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM SAFELY AS WE MAKE- ANY TRANSITIONS THAT THE STATE. IS CONSIDERING MOVING FORWARD SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE AREAS I WOULD HAVE LIKED. THANK YOU MISSING. THANK YOU I TOOK A GAS WE SEE OURSELVES IN TEN YEARS BEING THE CLEANEST SAFEST AND MOST INNOVATIVE GAS DISTRIBUTION UTILITY IN THE COUNTRY AND TO DO THAT WE ARE ALSO INVESTING IN A LOT OF I'VE HEARD IN THE AREAS OF RENEWABLE GAS. HYDROGEN AND OTHER INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES I SEE THE GREATEST RISK IS PERHAPS A- SHORT SIGHTED- PERSPECTIVE THAT. WOULD SAY THAT THAT YOU SHOULD HASTEN THE PATH TO GETTING THERE THAT COULD CREATE HONOR ABILITIES AND SYSTEM RELIABILITY THAT THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED LATELY I WOULD SEE THAT AS THE GREATEST RISK. OKAY IN THANK YOU MISSING AT THE APPRECIATE THE THAT COULD PICK COMINTERN SENTIMENT- IF- OF DISTRACTED ASKED THE SAME QUESTION TO THOSE OF MAY STILL BE ON THE ON THE CALL STILL FROM OUR FIRST PANEL IF YOU'RE STILL THERE- AND I DON'T MEAN LOOK DOWN HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE IS STILL ON THERE BEFORE ANYONE ELSE HAS CIVIL COMMENTER OF RISING. OF THOSE RISKS IN THE FUTURE YEARS- OR HOW WE ENSURE SAFETY IS PRIORITISED DURING THIS NEXT DECADE- IF NOT THE- DIRECTOR PALMER THE CPUC SAFETY UNIT IS LIKEWISE UNDERGOING STRUCTURAL CHANGES. AND WHAT IS THE NAME THAT YOU HOPE THIS REORGANIZATION WILL ACCOMPLISH. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER TO HELP YES SIDE TAKING FIRST DIVISION HAS GONE- MANY CHANGES JUST IN THE PAST YEAR- JUST FOR THOSE THAT ARE AWARE OF IT WE'VE ADDED A NEW BRANCH TO WATCH ARE SAFE ENOUGH FOR FROM BRANCH- WE'VE ALSO- RAIL SAFETY DIVISION AND YOU TOLD YOU SEE ONE DIVISION NOT EXPLAINED TO ITS OWN SO NOW WITHIN SIXTEEN. DIVISION WE HAVE A THREE LINES OF A FOCUSED REPAIRS RESPONSIBILITY SELECTRIC FIGURE LIABILITY GAS SAFETY RELIABILITY AND AGAIN THE WATER SAFETY ENFORCEMENT BRANCH WHICH PRIMARY GOAL IS TO FOCUS ON- YOU TELL POTENTIAL UTILITY COSTS WILDFIRES- AND MITIGATION EFFORTS AND PS PS OFFENSE. THE VISION OF A CITY MOVING FORWARD AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T QUITE REMEMBER SENATE MAYBE IT'S JUST SAID MULTIPLE TIMES EARLIER TODAY- BUT JUST LEARNING FROM EACH SIDE OF THE HOUSE HERE- ELECTRIC DOES SOME THINGS WELL GASCON LEARN SOMETHING. AND VICE VERSA SO I MAKE IT A POINT TO INTERPRET MY TEAMS WITH EACH OTHER ON A WEEKLY BASIS WHERE WE LEARN ABOUT WHAT EACH OTHER'S WORKING ON WHAT OUR PRIORITIES ARE WHAT OUR CHALLENGES ARE AND WHAT IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND EACH LINE OF BUSINESS PROCESS. AND AS WE DEVELOPED A NEW WATER PERCEIVED IMPORTANT BRANCH THAT GOES TO TAKE SOME PRESSURE OFF OF OUR ELECTRIC BRANCH WHICH HAS BEEN DOING IN SOME CASES AND I'VE STATED THIS IN PREVIOUS TESTIMONY- LAST YEAR NINETY FIVE WORKING HOURS RIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE FOCUSED ON WILDFIRES AND PSP'S EVENTS NEWSLETTER THAT'S AYE DEDICATED- STAFF. OF SOON TO BE PROFESSIONALS AS THEY GET HIRED AND TRAINED UP- BY MICHAEL MOVING FORCE RECIPE AS WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR NEW STRUCTURE. IS. TO COLLABORATE AND WORK HAND IN. AGAIN WITH THE COMMUTER. AND YET SO. I KNOW ON THE GAS. ON MY PROGRAM MANAGER TERRENCE ONLINE HERE TO MEET WITH EACH UTILITY ON A QUARTERLY. BASIS MY GOAL FOR WHAT. ARE FUTURE BUT ALL TAKE YOUR PARKING ARE. I WANT TO KEEP THE OPEN. GOING AT A PERFECT LEVEL. WHERE THEY'RE NOT A FOR TO TELL THAT THEY'RE HAVING A CONCERN. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WE WILL AND- WHAT IS OUT THERE. I'M IN GETTING A HOMEOWNER RELATIONS. THAT ANSWER QUESTION NO DOES FOR MUCH OF A AND- WE'RE REALLY OF PLEASED THAT pYOUR TO. A CERTAINLY TO THE SAFETY OF OUR IN FOR. AND AN ARE YOU TO SHOULD YOU- FOR THAT AND THANK YOU TO OUR SECOND PANEL. SO THAT THE KIM CONCLUDES OUR PANEL DISCUSSION AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE. PUBLIC COMMENT. DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND THE CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS MAY INSTITUTE INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY. TO ALL OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES. NOW WE WILL BEGIN WITH ANY WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OH THREE. I SEE NO ONE IN FORTY TWO OH THREE WE WILL NOW.

VERY IMPORTANT TO US AND WE WANT TO INCLUDE YOUR TESTIMONY IN THE OFFICIAL RECORD. OF THE HEARING TODAY THANK YOU AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THAT. SO TODAY- WE- WE'VE CONDUCTED A BIT OF A DIFFERENT HEARING. FOR US- THIS IS NOT THE NORMAL HEARING IS NOT- USUALLY WHAT WE DO THIS IS A RETROSPECTIVE. SO OFTEN OUR CONVERSATIONS AND OUR HEARINGS ARE DRIVEN BY ONE MAJOR EVENT AFTER THE NEXT MAJOR EVENT AND UNFORTUNATELY IN UTILITIES AND- IN CALIFORNIA THOSE EVENTS HAVE NOT BEEN- THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES- FOR ANYONE- I CERTAINLY DID NOT BEGIN MY WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE WITH PLANS TO DISCUSS- HE TO THE SAFETY. PREVENT EVENTS BROUGHT ME TO THE DISCUSSION TO THIS DISCUSSION AND KEPT ME FOCUSED ON ENSURING PROGRESS I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT LESSONS FROM THE PAST MUST BE STUDIED AND APPLIED TO ASSURE SAFETY. IN THE FUTURE. I AGREE WITH MANY WHO NOTED THAT WE'VE MADE SAFETY PROGRESS SINCE SAN BRUNO. BUT WE HAVE BY NO MEANS GONE FAR ENOUGH WE MUST KEEP SAFETY PROMOTION AS OUR CENTRAL FOCUS. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION THIS- MORNING AND AFTERNOON. AND APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TRY OUT OUR VIRTUAL FORMAT YOUR TIME EXPERTISE AND ENGAGEMENT ARE SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.
