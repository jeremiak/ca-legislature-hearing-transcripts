00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:51.475
AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:53.144
ACTUALLY EXPAND ACCESS OF ALL

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:54.512
CALIFORNIANS TO PARKS AND OPEN

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:59.884

I THINK ONE OF THE ONE OF THEIR

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.171
TOPICS OR ISSUES WE HAVE TO

00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:35.653
SO FOR EXAMPLE --

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.921
ADMINISTERING --

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:38.623
A SUMMER CAMP IN A PARK FOR

00:37:38.689 --> 00:37:39.757
DEVELOPING --

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:40.925
AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:42.693
GETS GETS OUT TO PARKS TYPICALLY

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.696
THAT HASN'T BEEN A USE OF A

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:46.831
GENERALIZATION BOND FUNDING.

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:47.865

00:37:59.577 --> 00:38:00.811
WHILE --

00:38:00.878 --> 00:38:02.179
ESSENTIALLY STAYING IN THE IN

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:05.616
THE LEAGUE ASIAN BOND --

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.585
BUT IT'S A PRIORITY OF OURS IN

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:08.219
ONE I THINK WE NEED TO DELIVER

00:38:08.285 --> 00:38:10.921
ON SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF IT

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:11.522
BECAUSE THE BOND WAS CLEAR ON

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.524
YES I AGREE --

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:14.992

GOING ON HERE IN THE PROPOSALS --

00:49:06.376 --> 00:49:07.678
BUT WE DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

00:49:07.744 --> 00:49:09.346
ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS FOR THE

00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:10.781
BUDGET YOU'RE WERE PRESENTED IN

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:13.116

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:20.257
ANY DETAIL OVER THOSE AM

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:22.759
DISCREET PROGRAMS AND SO FOR

00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:24.328
PROGRAMS THAT EITHER HAD

00:49:24.394 --> 00:49:25.629
PROPOSALS LAST YEAR WITH A LOT

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:27.397
OF DETAIL ARE CONTINUING OF

00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:29.399
EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT'S LESS OF

00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:30.367
A CONCERN.

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:32.002
BUT THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS IN

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:34.705
HERE THAT ARE BRAND VERY FIRST

00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:37.941
TIME AND WE THINK THAT YOU YOU

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:38.775
AND YOUR STAFF NEED.

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:40.377
AT A FAIR AMOUNT OF DETAIL ABOUT

00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:41.645
HOW ARE THOSE GOING TO BE

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:42.813
IMPLEMENTED.

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.014
IF THERE ARE NEW STAFF PROPOSED

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:46.149
WHAT ARE THOSE STAFF GOING INTO

00:49:46.216 --> 00:49:47.517
HOW WILL THE FUNDING GO OUT SO

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:48.819
THAT LACK OF DETAIL HAS BEEN

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:50.687
CONCERNING THE ADMINISTRATION TO

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:51.488
THEIR CREDIT HAS BEEN VERY

00:49:51.555 --> 00:49:52.589
RESPONSIVE TO ALL OF OUR

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:55.025
QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE PROGRAMS --

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:56.126
BUT OF COURSE THAT INFORMATION

00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:57.694
ISN'T PUBLIC WHEN WE HAVE BACK

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.496
AND FORTH TO THE ADMINISTRATION

00:49:59.563 --> 00:49:59.963
SO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.031
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT.

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:02.132
MOVING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE TO

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:03.700
HANDLE THESE THINGS AND IT IN A

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:04.468
DIFFERENT WAY BUT I THINK IT

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:06.236
DOES HIGHLIGHT THAT ESPECIALLY

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:07.304
FOR THOSE NEW PROGRAMS IS GONNA

00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:08.338
BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:09.840
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TO GET THE

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:11.641
INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED. TO

FEEL COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD

00:50:13.243 --> 00:50:17.681
WITH THOSE --

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:18.348
THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS I THINK

00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:18.949
ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF YOUR DENT

00:50:19.015 --> 00:50:20.384

NEXT THAT ARE BRAND NEW.

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:24.755
SO WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY

00:50:24.821 --> 00:50:26.723
REASONABLE GREAT STARTING PLACE

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.258
FOR THE BUDGET YEAR BUT IT'S NOT

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:30.527
THE ONLY WAY TO PROCEED AND SO

00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:32.095

CALIFORNIA.

00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:55.532
EITHER BECAUSE OF ITS SCARCITY

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:57.634

STATEHOOD.

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:04.474

WOULD BE FUNDED WE DO HAVE

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.364
SPECIFIC LISTS --

00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:30.233
THAT REALLY FRANKLY GO ON FOR

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.936
PAGES OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS IN

00:59:33.002 --> 00:59:34.737
THE INDIVIDUAL WATERSHEDS BUT WE

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:36.806
WOULD BE RELYING HEAVILY ON THE

00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:38.341
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND THE

00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:39.776
STAKEHOLDERS --

00:59:39.842 --> 00:59:41.744
MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS IN A

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:44.213
TRANSPARENT PROCESS ASSOCIATED

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.582

ALLOCATION OF TWO HUNDRED

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:51.554
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:54.190
ENDEAVOR. TO THE RESOURCES

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:54.624
AGENCY.

00:59:54.691 --> 00:59:56.292
WHY THIS YEAR WAS THE REQUEST

00:59:56.359 --> 00:59:58.061
NOT SEVENTY ONE MILLION INSTEAD

00:59:58.127 --> 01:00:00.430
OF SIXTY NINE MILLION I THINK IN

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:01.831
OUR BEST PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:03.333
AS TO DEPARTMENTS RUNNING

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:04.667
RESTORATION PROGRAMS AROUND THE

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:06.436
STATE?

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:08.071
CONTEMPLATING THE SCALE OF THE

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:09.505
ENDEAVOR.

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:10.773
WE MADE A BEST PROFESSIONAL

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.209
JUDGMENT THAT SEVENTY MILLION

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:14.844
WOULD BE A USABLE ASSET. TO

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.612
BEGIN INVESTING IN THE HABITAT

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:17.613
RESTORATION.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.248
HERE'S THE SCALE.

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:20.984
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RIVERS

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.685
THAT INCLUDE THE SACRAMENTO

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:25.955
SYSTEM FROM READING DOWN.

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:27.590
THE AMERICAN RIVER.

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:29.826
THE FEATHER RIVER.

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.227
THE YUBA RIVER.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.895
THE MCCOLLUM THE RIVER.

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:35.131
ALL OF THE LOWER SAN JOAQUIN

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:39.068
RIVER AS IT MOVES FROM FRESNO --

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.671
DOWN -- THE

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:42.739
TWELVE IN THE RIVER AND

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:44.440
POTENTIALLY OTHER TRIBUTARIES IN

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:46.676
THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM.

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:48.277
SO IT'S A LARGE SCALE.

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:51.080
WE SEE RESTORATION THINK --

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.482
CONNECTING RIVERS TO THE FLOOD

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:54.884
PLAIN THINK ABOUT REMOVING

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:57.053
BARRIERS TO FISH PASSAGE THINK

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.121
ABOUT.

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:00.590
MANAGING BETTER NON NATIVE FISH

01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:03.026
WHICH ARE HIGHLY IMPERILED

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:03.860
SALMON FISH.

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:07.263
PREDATION BY PREDATORS --

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.065
A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS HOW WOULD

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:11.501
THESE FUNDS BE MANAGED I THINK

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:12.502
WE WOULD FOLLOW.

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.237
THE RIGOR FOUND IN OUR EXISTING

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:16.105
GRANT PROGRAMS WE WOULD OFFER

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:18.608
OUR DEPARTMENTS AS ADVISORY TO

01:01:18.674 --> 01:01:20.543
THE RESOURCES AGENCY WHEN IT'S

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.145
RECEIVING PROPOSALS FOR

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:23.413
INVESTMENT IN THOSE WATERSHED

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:25.014
SUBJECT TO THE AGREEMENTS

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.516
THEMSELVES.

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:27.817
WE WOULD USE OUR SCIENTIFIC

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:29.819
STAFF TO HELP JUDGE THE MERITS

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:31.421
WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'RE VERY

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:32.989
COMFORTABLE DOING.

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.257
AND WE WOULD FOLLOW THE WATER

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:37.794
CODE SECTIONS SEVEN NINE SEVEN

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.562
THREE TWO AND SEVEN NINE SEVEN

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.264
THREE SIX WHICH REALLY DEFINE

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.665
THE QUALIFYING ACTIVITIES.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:45.501
THEY COULD AVAIL THEMSELVES OF

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:49.338
THIS PART OF FOR FUNDS --

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:53.543
I THINK THAT'S A BROAD BRUSH --

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:55.111
SURVEY OF WHAT WE INTEND TO DO.

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:56.712

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:39.122

DOESN'T RUN TO WATERS.

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.396
OUTSIDE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:50.366
BECAUSE IN A TECHNICAL SENSE THE

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.502
STATE WATER BOARD IS CURRENTLY

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:53.870

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:03.779

AGAIN THESE SUPPORTIVE

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:29.051
ACTIVITIES WILL BE GREATLY

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.452

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:36.659
YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT REQUEST.

01:11:36.725 --> 01:11:38.727
TO MOVE ON TO A COUPLE OF THE

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:40.162
OTHER QUESTIONS --

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:42.297
THERE WAS A QUESTION RELATED TO

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:43.766
THE SIX NEW POSITIONS IN Y.

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:46.635
STOCK WORK LOAD HAS INCREASED.

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:49.171
AND I BELIEVE I DID COVER THIS

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.539
BUT I JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:52.441
WE ARE LOOKING AT A NUMBER THAT

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:55.244
HAS ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED FOR THE

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:56.578
TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE FOR

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:57.813
CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.982
GSA'S HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:01.317
DELIVER THEIR OWN PLAN WE HAVE

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:03.519
TWO INTERN SIXTY SEVEN GSA'S IN

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:04.687
THE STATE.

01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:06.221
AND THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DELIVER

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:08.457
THEIR OWN GROUND WATER BUT

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:09.958
WITHIN THE BASIN EACH BASIN IS

01:12:10.025 --> 01:12:11.460
APPROACHING HOWEVER HOW THEY

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.929
WANT TO DELIVER THEIR GROUND

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.764
WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS.

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:17.966
SO MULTIPLE GSA'S CAN DELIVER

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:20.803
MULTIPLE TIAS PEAS ARE PLANS FOR

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:22.938
THAT BASIN OR THERE COULD BE ONE

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.406
BASIN WITH ONE PLAN.

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:26.041
SO AS THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED AT

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.476
THE LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH THAT

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:28.944

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.449
EXPECTING TO THAN THAT GOES BACK

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:35.050
TO HOW WE'RE LEARNING THERE'S

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:36.618
RIGHT NOW KIND OF A DOUBLING.

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:38.954

THEIR WORK THIS SPRING THE

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:08.083
SECOND ROUND WAS --

01:27:34.716 --> 01:27:36.818
YES IT IS SO AND HOW WILL HOW

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:39.887
WILL YOU BE ABLE --

01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:42.190
TO BUT IF IT IF WE'RE TALKING

01:27:42.256 --> 01:27:43.458
ABOUT EQUITY THEM WHAT'S THE

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:45.226
PROCESS GOING TO BE TO MAKE SURE

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:47.428
THAT THAT ALL OF THE THE AREAS

01:27:47.495 --> 01:27:50.365
THAT MOST NEED ACCESS OR THE

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:53.968
ONES THAT DO GET IT.

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:56.137
THAT'S VERY GOOD QUESTION --

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:57.038
IN COURT TO THIS WHOLE EFFORT

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:58.773
HAS TO BE ON WE HAVE TO STICK

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.308
BUT TAKE A STEP AWAY FROM

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:01.676
BUSINESS AS USUAL THIS SHOULD

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:02.677
NOT BE SEEN.

01:28:02.744 --> 01:28:04.846
AS SIMPLY FUNDING ORGANIZATIONS

01:28:04.912 --> 01:28:06.414
TO DO WITH THE CURRENTLY DOING

01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:08.216
WE START WITH THE PREMISE THAT.

01:28:08.282 --> 01:28:10.952
IF WE WERE ABLE TO DO TO DO MORE

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:11.886
OF WHAT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN DOING

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.621
THE MOVIE WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:15.089
IN NOT HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:16.591
IT'S AUTOMATICALLY WHAT WE'RE

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:17.959
LOOKING AT IS NEW AND CREATIVE

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:20.328
CREATIVE WAYS OF ENGAGING THAT

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:21.596
WILL INCLUDE --

01:28:21.663 --> 01:28:23.064
HAVING THINGS SUCH AS A HOME

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.199
BASE MAKING CERTAIN THAT THEIR

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:26.868
ACTIVITIES NOT JUST THE WAY BUT

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:28.202
THAT PEOPLE WERE ULTIMATELY IN

01:28:28.269 --> 01:28:29.704
ORGANIZATIONS COMING TO

01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:30.471
COMMUNITIES.

01:28:30.538 --> 01:28:31.673
THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT

01:28:31.739 --> 01:28:34.876
WE LOOK FOR IN OUR PROCESS

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:36.177
THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT SHOULD

01:28:36.244 --> 01:28:37.478
HAPPEN AND WE ASKED A LOT OF OUR

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:39.981
APPLICANTS BUT WE STAND SIDE BY

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:40.682
SIDE WITH THEM THROUGH THE

01:28:40.748 --> 01:28:41.349
PROCESS.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:43.451
AND THE TWO THINGS THAT WE HAVE

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:45.653
FOUND THAT HAPPEN OR ARE THESE

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.721
ONE DAY EITHER RECEIVE A GRANT

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:48.423
BUT ULTIMATELY TRANSFORMS OUR

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:51.993
COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE INSIST ON

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:52.660
AUGUST.

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:54.262
DODD IN DEPTH COMMUNITY ENGAGE

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:54.929
PROCESS.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:58.199
OR TO THE COMMUNITY WILL BECOME

01:28:58.266 --> 01:29:01.402
CIVIC CONTRAST FROM THE

01:29:01.469 --> 01:29:03.237
PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES.

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:05.506
BY DEVELOPING --

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:06.941
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR LOCAL

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.576
PROVIDERS THAT INCLUDES NON

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:10.344
PROFITS AND THAT INCLUDES PUBLIC

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:12.547
AGENCIES SO AS WE LOOK AT THIS

01:29:12.613 --> 01:29:13.915
PARTICULAR PROGRAM.

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:15.416
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT CAN WE

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:17.452
DO FOR YOU IT'S ULTIMATELY HOW

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:18.252
ARE THE PROGRAM'S GOING TO

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:19.587
TRANSFORM THOSE PARTICULAR

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:21.322
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE ACCESS IS

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:23.091
NOT JUST THE WAY IT'S ALSO AT

01:29:23.157 --> 01:29:23.558
HOME.

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:25.293
AND ULTIMATELY THE PEOPLE NEED

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:26.461
TO BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH THE

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:27.662
PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:29.697
THERE AND HAVE BENEFIT THAT THAT

01:29:29.764 --> 01:29:30.398
THAT -- FROM

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:31.666
THESE DOLLARS THAT WILL ALLOW

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:33.234
FOR THEM TO HAVE AN ON GOING

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.002
RELATIONSHIP WITH NATURE WHETHER

01:29:35.069 --> 01:29:35.837
THAT BE THROUGH ACTIVE

01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:37.305
RECREATION OR WHETHER IT BE

01:29:37.371 --> 01:29:38.606
THROUGH OPEN SPACES.

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.074
SO STARTING WITH THAT PREMISE

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:42.110
WE'RE CHALLENGING NON PROFITS

01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:44.679
AND PUBLIC AGENTS AGENCIES IN

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:45.246
HELPING US TO DEVELOP THIS

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:46.214
PROGRAM.

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.148
THAT IT'S ONE THAT WILL BE

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:48.850
LOOKED UPON HOPEFULLY AS A MODEL

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.485
FOR THE NATION AND NOT JUST

01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:51.552
BUSINESS AS USUAL.

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:54.622
ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO DEFINE AND

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:56.958
EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:57.925
THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT PUTTING

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:59.660
FORTH THE ENTIRE THIRTY TWO

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:00.695
MILLION WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS

01:30:00.762 --> 01:30:02.029
WITH THE FIRST SEVENTEEN MILLION

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:04.632
OF THIS WHICH WE NEED --

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:08.269

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:10.471
TWENTY TWO SO DOING THAT AND AND

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:12.140

HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SHIFT WHAT

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:14.742
THEY'RE DOING.

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:16.210
IS WHY WE'RE STARTING AS AS THE

01:30:16.277 --> 01:30:17.545
PRO AS THE MODEL AND THEN THE

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:19.080
DIGITAL FUNDS WILL LOOK AT AND

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:20.782
SEE IF WE NEED TO EXPAND ON

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:22.817
PROGRAMMING OR WHETHER WE NEED.

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:25.386
TO CREATE SOMETHING COMPLETELY

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:28.456

01:30:33.027 --> 01:30:34.929
A NATURAL ORGANIC AFFECT.

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:37.565
WE DON'T GO INTO THE BUSINESS OF

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:38.933
TRYING -- TO

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.201

01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:39.660
TYPICALLY --

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:41.428
CAPITAL OUTLAY HAS BEEN THE

01:36:41.495 --> 01:36:42.963
PRIMARY FOCUS OF GEO BONDS --

01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.998
BUT THE LEGISLATURE VERY

01:36:44.064 --> 01:36:46.867

01:36:58.512 --> 01:36:59.313
CRITICAL TO GETTING SPECIALLY

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.181
FOLKS WILL DISMISS COMMUNITIES

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:01.448
THAT HAVE --

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:02.917
LESS RESOURCES TAKE TO GET OUT

01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:04.151
TO THESE PLACES ON TO BE ABLE TO

01:37:04.218 --> 01:37:05.920

A STATE --

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:13.093
JUST AS MUCH AS BOOKS FROM MORE

LOOKING IN I THINK --

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:19.700
ADDITIONAL CLARITY IN DISCUSSION

01:37:19.767 --> 01:37:22.436
BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE IT'S AND

FOLKS AT THAT THE AGENCY --

01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:25.739
WILL HOPEFULLY PROVIDE THAT

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:27.341
CLARITY ABOUT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:28.309
INTENDED --

01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:29.410
WHEN IT COMES TO ENGAGE IN

01:37:29.476 --> 01:37:31.145
PROGRAMS AND AND HOW IT WAS

01:37:31.212 --> 01:37:32.346
WRITTEN --

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:33.414
BY THE AUTHORS AND BY THE

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.748
DIFFERENT MEMBERS THAT ENGAGE IN

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:38.152
THAT PROCESS TO TO PROVIDE THAT --

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:38.786
THAT RESOLUTION HOPEFULLY THIS

01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:39.753
YEAR.

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.322
AND THEN CEDRIC MENTIONED --

01:37:41.388 --> 01:37:42.590
THE LIQUIDATION PERIOD FOR THE

01:37:42.656 --> 01:37:44.425
COMMUNITY ACCESS PROGRAM --

01:37:44.491 --> 01:37:45.025
FOR THIS FIRST ROUND THAT WAS

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:48.596
APPROPRIATE LAST YEAR OF TWENTY

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:49.196
TWENTY TWO WHICH RAISES IT'S

01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:50.531
MORE LIKE A TECHNICAL ISSUE

01:37:50.598 --> 01:37:52.366
AROUND ENCUMBRANCE PERIODS AND

01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:53.834
AND HOW QUICKLY THE PROJECT

01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:54.602
COMPLETION NEEDS TO BE TURNED

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:55.536
OVER.

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:57.605
AND AND COMPLETED --

01:37:57.671 --> 01:37:59.373
SO ONE SUGGESTION THAT THAT WE

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.140
HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING ARE

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:01.675

SPECIFIC TO THE COMMUNITY ACTS --

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:15.022

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:30.704
WANTING TO SEE THAT ADDRESSED IS

01:38:30.771 --> 01:38:33.407

MORE BROADLY TO THOUGH --

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:36.176
YOU KNOW AN EARLY DISCUSSIONS

01:38:36.243 --> 01:38:37.711

JANUARY --

01:38:38.912 --> 01:38:40.914
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THERE

01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:51.592
AND PARKS ISSUES --

01:38:51.659 --> 01:38:52.960
THAT THE VOTERS IN THE

01:38:57.298 --> 01:38:58.132
CURRENTLY BEING INVESTED BY THE

01:38:58.198 --> 01:38:59.533

IT'S IN THE STATUTE.

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:21.689
AND WE WE BELIEVE IT'S USEFUL AS

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:23.557
A DISCUSSION POINT WHERE THE

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:24.491

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:29.430
THAT CAN BE FUNDED THROUGH THE

HAVE THREE OVER ARCHING COMMENTS

01:54:21.321 --> 01:54:23.523
AND CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL.

01:54:23.590 --> 01:54:25.225
FIRST IS A LACK OF CLARITY ON

01:54:25.291 --> 01:54:25.959
HOW THE SPENDING WILL BE

01:54:26.025 --> 01:54:28.127
PRIORITIZED BY EACH DEPARTMENT

01:54:28.194 --> 01:54:29.629

01:54:32.198 --> 01:54:33.199
PROJECTS.

01:54:33.266 --> 01:54:36.369

DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SOME

01:54:42.542 --> 01:54:43.576
CRITERIA FOR HOW THEY WOULD

01:54:43.643 --> 01:54:44.644
PRIORITIZE BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S

01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:46.679
VERY HARD FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND

01:54:46.746 --> 01:54:47.247
EXACTLY HOW.

01:54:47.313 --> 01:54:48.982
THEY'RE FORTY FIVE MILLION WILL

01:54:49.048 --> 01:54:51.317

01:54:55.688 --> 01:54:56.256
PROVIDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:54:56.322 --> 01:54:57.657
MONEY IS REALLY A SHORT TERM

01:54:57.724 --> 01:54:58.992
RESPONSE TO AN UNDERLYING

01:54:59.058 --> 01:55:00.326
PROBLEM AND SO IT'S REALLY

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:01.361
IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE

01:55:01.427 --> 01:55:03.363
THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE NEEDS.

01:55:03.429 --> 01:55:08.968
AND RESOURCES AND PRACTICES AT

01:55:09.035 --> 01:55:10.236
AND KIND OF AN ONGOING BLEEDING

01:55:10.303 --> 01:55:12.272
PROBLEM AND AND THAT THERE ARE

01:55:12.338 --> 01:55:14.073
ONGOING MAINTENANCE PRACTICES AT

01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:15.541
THESE DEPARTMENTS --

01:55:15.608 --> 01:55:16.909
THERE WAS FUNDING EITHER IN THE

01:55:16.976 --> 01:55:18.278
CURRENT YEAR ARE PROPOSED FOR

01:55:18.344 --> 01:55:20.546

CONSERVATION CORPS CALIFORNIA

01:55:24.183 --> 01:55:25.918
PARKS BUT NOT FOR THE OTHER

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:27.320
THREE AND SO --

01:55:27.387 --> 01:55:28.087
WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:55:28.154 --> 01:55:29.422
WHEN USING STATE RESEARCH TO

01:55:29.489 --> 01:55:31.157
UNDERSTAND THAT THE UNDERLYING

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:33.860
PROBLEM IS ALSO BEING ADDRESSED.

01:55:33.926 --> 01:55:35.194
AND THEN THIRD AT THE

01:55:35.261 --> 01:55:36.296
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSED A

01:55:36.362 --> 01:55:37.964
WAY TO TRACK THE OUTCOMES FOR

01:55:38.031 --> 01:55:39.299
THIS FUNDING HOW WILL THEY

01:55:39.365 --> 01:55:40.600
ACTUALLY BE SPENT AND HOW WILL

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:42.702
THE LEGISLATURE KNOW THAT FUNDS

01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:44.003
WERE SPENT AS PROPOSED.

01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.938
SO AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA WE

01:55:46.005 --> 01:55:47.173
PROPOSE --

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.541

PERHAPS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:05:52.077 --> 02:05:53.479
MIGHT HAVE BEEN HERE IN THE

02:05:53.545 --> 02:05:54.880
SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES.

02:05:54.947 --> 02:05:59.084
BUT IN SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND

02:05:59.151 --> 02:06:00.452
SEVENTEEN WE HAD A REPORT AND

02:06:00.519 --> 02:06:01.887
IDENTIFY THE NUTRI AND MERCED

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:03.756
COUNTY.

02:06:03.822 --> 02:06:06.425
HERE'S THE PROBLEM --

02:06:06.492 --> 02:06:09.695
THE ANIMALS EAT.

02:06:09.762 --> 02:06:11.597
LAND AND VEGETATION THEY BURROW

02:06:11.664 --> 02:06:14.033
INTO WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THE

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:16.435
BURROW INTO LEVEES THEY COMPETE

02:06:16.502 --> 02:06:17.970
WITH NATIVE SPECIES.

02:06:18.037 --> 02:06:19.939
THEY ARE AN INVASIVE SPECIES

02:06:20.005 --> 02:06:21.507
THAT PRODUCES GREAT RISK FOR THE

02:06:21.573 --> 02:06:22.841
STATE.

02:06:22.908 --> 02:06:25.044
JUST ON THE WATER SUPPLY FRONT

02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:25.945
ALONE.

02:06:26.011 --> 02:06:28.080
IMAGINE BURROWING INTO A LEVY

02:06:28.147 --> 02:06:30.082
WHICH PROVIDES FLOOD PROTECTION

02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:32.885
AND THIS ACTIVITY PROVOKING A

02:06:32.952 --> 02:06:34.486
LEVEE COLLAPSED.

02:06:34.553 --> 02:06:37.356
SO SINCE.

02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:38.223
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAVE

02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:40.192
FOUND ADDITIONAL ANIMALS IN

02:06:40.259 --> 02:06:42.695
MERCED IN STANISLAUS COUNTY TO

02:06:42.761 --> 02:06:44.596
WOLLEMI COUNTY FRESNO COUNTY SAN

02:06:44.663 --> 02:06:45.998
JOAQUIN COUNTY.

02:06:46.065 --> 02:06:47.700
AND MARIPOSA COUNTY.

02:06:47.766 --> 02:06:49.702
THEY'RE A HOP SKIP AND A JUMP

02:06:49.768 --> 02:06:52.604
FROM THE DELTA PROPER.

02:06:52.671 --> 02:06:54.039
I HAVE A CHART --

02:06:54.106 --> 02:06:56.175
YOU WANT TO PASS AROUND TO YOU

02:06:56.241 --> 02:06:57.576
THROUGH THE SERGEANT WHICH

02:06:57.643 --> 02:06:58.744
ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THE

02:06:58.811 --> 02:07:01.180
POPULATION MODELING WE'VE DONE

02:07:01.246 --> 02:07:02.815
JUST ROUGH ESTIMATES.

02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:05.517
FROM THE MOMENT OF INDICATION

02:07:05.584 --> 02:07:07.286
FIVE YEARS OUT.

02:07:07.353 --> 02:07:08.921
IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING IN FIVE

02:07:08.988 --> 02:07:11.223
YEARS WE PROTECT A POPULATION OF

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:12.658
TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND

02:07:12.725 --> 02:07:15.461
PLUS.

02:07:15.527 --> 02:07:17.196
IN OUR WATERWAYS.

02:07:17.262 --> 02:07:22.234
SO THE PROPOSAL TODAY IS. FOUR

02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:24.470
ONE POINT. NINE FOUR NINE

02:07:24.536 --> 02:07:27.740
MILLION IN GENERAL FUND ONE TIME.

02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:28.307
TEN POSITIONS.

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:32.845
AND ONE FOR MILLION ON GOING.

02:07:32.911 --> 02:07:35.180
SINCE WE FIRST FOUND THE ANIMALS

02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:36.849
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HERE

02:07:36.915 --> 02:07:38.283
ARE THE THINGS THE DEPARTMENT

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:40.486
HAS ALREADY DONE.

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:42.087
WITHIN A YEAR WE COULD WE STOOD

02:07:42.154 --> 02:07:45.391
UP AN INCIDENT COMMAND STRUCTURE --

02:07:45.457 --> 02:07:48.127
OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM.

02:07:48.193 --> 02:07:50.696
WE WE DEDICATED OUR OWN STAFF

02:07:50.763 --> 02:07:53.332
OVER FORTY OF THEM FROM EQUALLY

02:07:53.399 --> 02:07:56.201
IMPORTANT WORK TO THIS TOPIC.

02:07:56.268 --> 02:07:58.003
WE'VE FOUND MATCHING FUNDS WITH

02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:59.671
THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND

02:07:59.738 --> 02:08:01.573
AGRICULTURE.

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:03.509
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES --

02:08:03.575 --> 02:08:05.310
THE DELTA CONSERVANCY.

02:08:05.377 --> 02:08:08.647
AND WE'VE A RADIC IT'D ABOUT

02:08:08.714 --> 02:08:09.982
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE

02:08:10.049 --> 02:08:13.685
NUTRIA AND WE'VE SURVEYED

02:08:13.752 --> 02:08:16.021
970-004-0040 ACRES.

02:08:16.088 --> 02:08:17.523
BUT TO AVOID THAT POPULATION

02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:19.892
CURVE PROBLEM WE NEED THIS

02:08:19.958 --> 02:08:23.295
INVESTMENT NOW --

02:08:23.362 --> 02:08:24.763
TO KEEP ON THIS PROBLEM.

02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:28.801
HERE ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF WHERE

02:08:28.867 --> 02:08:30.602
CALIFORNIA IS AT THIS MOMENT.

02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:31.970
NUTRIA WERE FOUND IN THE

02:08:32.037 --> 02:08:33.605
CHESAPEAKE BAY.

02:08:33.672 --> 02:08:35.541
ON THE EAST COAST.

02:08:35.607 --> 02:08:39.078
OVER ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS --

02:08:39.144 --> 02:08:41.313
OF VARIETY OF ENTITIES.

02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:42.681
REMOVED ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:44.583
ANIMALS.

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:47.386
AND NOW CONCLUDE.

02:08:47.453 --> 02:08:48.987
THE CHESAPEAKE ECOSYSTEM IS

02:08:49.054 --> 02:08:50.622
RELATIVELY FREE FROM THE

02:08:50.689 --> 02:08:52.524
INVASIVE SPECIES.

02:08:52.591 --> 02:08:55.227
COMPARE THAT TO LOUISIANA.

02:08:55.294 --> 02:08:56.862
WHEN LOUISIANA HAD THE ANIMAL

02:08:56.929 --> 02:08:59.998
APPEAR IT DIDN'T DO MUCH EARLY?

02:09:00.065 --> 02:09:01.133
NOW.

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.135
YEAR AFTER YEAR IT PAYS TWO

02:09:03.202 --> 02:09:05.170
MILLION DOLLARS TO PEOPLE FOR

02:09:05.237 --> 02:09:06.538
BOUNTIES.

02:09:06.605 --> 02:09:08.574
JUST TO KEEP.

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:10.242
THE POPULATION SUPPRESSED.

02:09:10.309 --> 02:09:12.010
NOT REMOVED.

02:09:12.077 --> 02:09:13.312
AND IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE

02:09:13.378 --> 02:09:15.848
VISUAL AREA AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS

02:09:15.914 --> 02:09:17.583
OF THE LOSS OF WETLANDS IN THE

02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:19.485
BY YOU COUNTRY IN LOUISIANA FROM

02:09:19.551 --> 02:09:20.552
THE NUTRIA.

02:09:20.619 --> 02:09:22.454
IT'S MIND NUMBING.

02:09:22.521 --> 02:09:24.990
SO WE WANT TO BE AHEAD OF THIS --

02:09:25.057 --> 02:09:26.458
RELATIVE TO THIS INVASIVE

02:09:26.525 --> 02:09:29.561
SPECIES THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL

02:09:29.628 --> 02:09:29.862

DID YOU SAY THAT WE IT WAS THE

02:09:36.802 --> 02:09:38.137
SEVENTIES WHEN WE THOUGHT WE

02:09:38.203 --> 02:09:40.539
WERE DONE WITH THE NUTRIA YES.

02:09:40.606 --> 02:09:42.508
DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHY NOW

02:09:42.574 --> 02:09:44.443
WE DON'T.

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:48.180
BUT SOMEONE BROUGHT THEM

02:09:48.247 --> 02:09:48.480
[inaudible]

02:09:48.547 --> 02:09:51.083
AS WITH.

I'M ARE YOU COORDINATING WITH

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:55.254
OTHER WESTERN STATES ARE WEST

02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:57.055
COAST STATES I'M SO THAT WE'RE

02:09:57.122 --> 02:09:58.824
NOT SPENDING MONEY JUST TO HAVE

02:09:58.891 --> 02:10:00.125
THEM COME BACK FROM OTHER STATES

02:10:00.192 --> 02:10:01.827
YES.

02:10:01.894 --> 02:10:04.429
SO OUR PROPOSAL TODAY AND OUR

BY A COUPLE STEPS.

02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:10.402
WE CALLED UP OUR FEDERAL

COUNTERPARTS WHO ONE OF THE

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:14.773
LEADERS IN THE CHESAPEAKE EFFORT.

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:16.608
WE'VE SPOKEN TO OUR COUNTERPARTS

02:10:16.675 --> 02:10:17.843
IN LOUISIANA.

02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:19.578
OUR STATE AGENCY IS PART OF A

02:10:19.645 --> 02:10:21.013
BROADER ASSOCIATION WHICH IS ALL

02:10:21.079 --> 02:10:24.249
OF THE FIFTY WILDLIFE AGENCIES.

02:10:24.316 --> 02:10:26.351
WE'VE GONE INTO THAT ASSOCIATION

02:10:26.418 --> 02:10:28.353
TO LEARN BEST PRACTICES.

02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:29.688
AND WHILE THIS IS CONTROVERSY

02:10:29.755 --> 02:10:31.290
ALLIED MEN.

02:10:31.356 --> 02:10:33.358

02:10:40.732 --> 02:10:42.668
WHY?

02:10:42.734 --> 02:10:43.268
THEY WERE THE MAIN IT TO T.

02:10:43.335 --> 02:10:45.537

02:10:45.604 --> 02:10:47.706
CHESAPEAKE BAY. ONE WAY TO

02:10:47.773 --> 02:10:49.041
IDENTIFY THE AND FIND THE

02:10:49.107 --> 02:10:51.543
ANIMALS AS THEIR DOGS TRACKING

02:10:51.610 --> 02:10:52.711
THE ANIMALS.

02:10:52.778 --> 02:10:54.379
AND WE'VE RELIED ON THEIR

02:10:54.446 --> 02:10:55.981

HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:11:00.419 --> 02:11:02.955
SO WE WENT OUT AND SURVEYED WHAT

02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:04.756
PEOPLE HAVE DONE TO INFORM WHAT

02:11:04.823 --> 02:11:06.024

WHERE FREE FROM THE REST THAT

02:11:13.298 --> 02:11:14.733
SOMEONE MAY BRING NUTRIA BACK

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:16.902
AND NO I CAN'T?

02:11:16.969 --> 02:11:18.870

THE AG IS CONCERNED ABOUT IT SO

02:12:54.366 --> 02:12:55.834
OUR CONCERN IS THAT NUTRI BOTH

02:12:55.901 --> 02:12:58.537
CONSUME CROPS SO THAT'S OF LOS

02:12:58.603 --> 02:13:00.339
TO OUR MEMBERS BUT ALSO.

02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:02.741
THE IMPACT THAT THEY HAVE ON

02:13:02.808 --> 02:13:04.943
WATER DELIVERY SYSTEMS SO IF WE

02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:07.179
HAVE A LEVEE BREAK AS THE

02:13:07.245 --> 02:13:07.813

02:15:32.691 --> 02:15:34.593
CONTEXT AND THEN RESPOND TO YOUR

THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED --

02:15:39.397 --> 02:15:40.198
MISTER BONTA MENTIONED ABOUT --

02:15:40.265 --> 02:15:41.433
FISH AND WILDLIFE BEING ONE OF

02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:43.535
THE OLDEST AGENCIES THAT YOU

02:15:43.602 --> 02:15:44.135
HAVE YOUR ONE OF THE OLDEST

02:15:44.202 --> 02:15:45.270
DEPARTMENTS THE BOARD HAS

02:15:45.337 --> 02:15:46.671
ACTUALLY BEEN AROUND SINCE

02:15:46.738 --> 02:15:47.772
NINETEEN A LAB AND IT WAS THE

02:15:47.839 --> 02:15:50.308
RECLAMATION BOARD BEFORE IT WAS.

02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:51.576
REIMAGINE DOES THE CENTER VALLEY

02:15:51.643 --> 02:15:53.612
FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD AND WE'VE

02:15:53.678 --> 02:15:55.046
BEEN OVERSEEING THE STATE PLAN A

02:15:55.113 --> 02:15:56.548
FLOOD CONTROL FACILITIES FOR ALL

02:15:56.615 --> 02:15:58.183
OF THAT TIME.

02:15:58.250 --> 02:15:59.017
SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:15:59.084 --> 02:16:00.619
UNIQUE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE

02:16:00.685 --> 02:16:03.255
NOW -- WE

02:16:03.321 --> 02:16:05.757
ARE NOT THE PROJECT MANAGER FOR

02:16:05.824 --> 02:16:06.958
PROJECTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:16:07.025 --> 02:16:08.493
THAT SOMETHING WE CONTRACT WITH

02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:09.361
THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

02:16:09.427 --> 02:16:10.962
RESOURCES FOR AND THEY PROVIDE

02:16:11.029 --> 02:16:13.198
STAFFING AND THEY ALSO OBTAIN

02:16:13.265 --> 02:16:14.900
THE BUDGET FOR THOSE PROJECTS.

02:16:14.966 --> 02:16:15.867
BUT WE DO MAINTAIN OUR

02:16:15.934 --> 02:16:17.802
REGULATORY ROLE THAT THAT IS

02:16:17.869 --> 02:16:19.304
THROUGH AT A MEMORANDUM OF

02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:20.205
AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE WITH THE

02:16:20.272 --> 02:16:21.239
DEPARTMENT THAT IN OUR

02:16:21.306 --> 02:16:22.674
REGULATORY ROLE.

02:16:22.741 --> 02:16:23.909
WE MANAGE LOCAL MAINTAINING

02:16:23.975 --> 02:16:25.710
AGENCIES THAT PERFORM OPERATIONS

02:16:25.777 --> 02:16:26.645
AND MAINTENANCE ON THE

02:16:26.711 --> 02:16:28.313
FACILITIES AND WE MANAGE THESE

02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:29.781
ENCROACHMENTS THAT ARE IN AND

02:16:29.848 --> 02:16:31.216
AROUND THE FACILITIES THE STATE

02:16:31.283 --> 02:16:32.284
PLAN OF FLOOD CONTROL.

02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:34.619
AND THAT'S THE CRUX OF THIS

02:16:34.686 --> 02:16:36.988
REQUEST THAT THE FEDERAL

02:16:37.055 --> 02:16:39.624
BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACTIVE TWO

02:16:39.691 --> 02:16:41.192
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN CONGRESS

02:16:41.259 --> 02:16:43.795
ALLOWED APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT

02:16:43.862 --> 02:16:45.330
SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO THE ARMY

02:16:45.397 --> 02:16:47.098
CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO BE SPENT

02:16:47.165 --> 02:16:48.700
ON THIS PROJECT IN THE CENTRAL

02:16:48.767 --> 02:16:50.669
VALLEY IN BY THIS PROJECT I MEAN

02:16:50.735 --> 02:16:51.870
WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE AMERICAN.

02:16:51.937 --> 02:16:53.538
RIVER COMMON FEATURES IT'S A

02:16:53.605 --> 02:16:55.140
VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT IT'S

02:16:55.206 --> 02:16:56.775
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN ON OUR

02:16:56.841 --> 02:16:58.476
RADAR FOR A LONG TIME THAT NEEDS

02:16:58.543 --> 02:17:00.979
IMPROVEMENT AND THE STATE AND

02:17:01.046 --> 02:17:02.113
THE LOCAL ENTITIES.

02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:03.081
HAVE ALL --

02:17:03.148 --> 02:17:04.649
ALREADY GOTTEN THEIR SHARE OF

02:17:04.716 --> 02:17:06.318
FUNDING FOR THAT WHAT THIS

02:17:06.384 --> 02:17:08.186
INFUSION OF FEDERAL FUNDING DID

02:17:08.253 --> 02:17:09.821
THOUGH IS PROVIDE US WITH THIS.

02:17:09.888 --> 02:17:11.323
ABOUT EIGHTEEN TIMES WHAT THEY

02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:13.592
WOULD NORMALLY GET IN A YEAR AND

02:17:13.658 --> 02:17:17.028
THAT CAUSED THAT THE ARMY CORPS

02:17:17.095 --> 02:17:18.930
TO GO INTO.

02:17:18.997 --> 02:17:21.099
HI DEAR AND ON THE STATE SIDE WE

02:17:21.166 --> 02:17:24.069
WANTED TO CLEAR THE DECKS OF ANY --

02:17:24.135 --> 02:17:25.370
THING THAT MIGHT BE IN THE WAY

02:17:25.437 --> 02:17:27.339
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEING

02:17:27.405 --> 02:17:28.340
ABLE TO SPEND WITH THIS LARGE

02:17:28.406 --> 02:17:29.741
ASK BECAUSE THIS IS NOT

02:17:29.808 --> 02:17:31.543
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN.

02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:32.744
THIRTY YEARS THIS IS NEVER

02:17:32.811 --> 02:17:33.678
HAPPENED SO WE WANTED TO BE ABLE

02:17:33.745 --> 02:17:35.947
WE CAN TO MAKE SURE WE COULD

02:17:36.014 --> 02:17:37.082
LEVERAGE ALL THAT MONEY.

02:17:37.148 --> 02:17:38.683
MORE RECENTLY AND THIS IS THE

02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:40.151
CRUX OF THE QUESTIONS THERE'S

02:17:40.218 --> 02:17:42.020
BEEN SOME SPECULATION THAT THE

02:17:42.087 --> 02:17:43.622
PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY

02:17:43.688 --> 02:17:45.824
DECLARATION WILL INTERFERE OR RE

02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:48.259
DIRECT THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN.

02:17:48.326 --> 02:17:50.228
IDENTIFIED FOR THIS PROJECT IN

02:17:50.295 --> 02:17:52.464
AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT WOULD

02:17:52.530 --> 02:17:53.198
HAPPEN.

02:17:53.264 --> 02:17:55.133
TO OBJECTS THAT THE FEDERAL

02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:57.569
FUNDING DIDN'T MATERIALIZE.

02:17:57.636 --> 02:17:58.536
I'M.

02:17:58.603 --> 02:17:59.971
I I CAN'T SPECULATE WITH

02:18:00.038 --> 02:18:02.340
SPECULATE ON WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN --

02:18:02.407 --> 02:18:05.043
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE STATE AND

02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:06.711
THE ARMY CORPS IF TAKEN --

02:18:06.778 --> 02:18:08.713
SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO PROTECT

02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:09.848
THIS FUNDING WE'VE ALREADY

02:18:09.914 --> 02:18:11.650
SIGNED THAT PROJECT PARTNERSHIP

02:18:11.716 --> 02:18:13.518
AGREEMENT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE

02:18:13.585 --> 02:18:15.120
ARMY CORPS PUTS THIS IN A POT OF

02:18:15.186 --> 02:18:17.088
MONEY THAT'S ALREADY COMMITTED

02:18:17.155 --> 02:18:18.823
AND AND THEREFORE.

02:18:18.890 --> 02:18:21.326
MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT SPOT NOT

02:18:21.393 --> 02:18:22.961
DONE EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD TO

02:18:23.028 --> 02:18:25.130
ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN.

02:18:25.196 --> 02:18:27.799
A PROCESS FOR MOVING FORWARD.

02:18:27.866 --> 02:18:28.867
AND EVEN IF THIS FUND THIS

02:18:28.933 --> 02:18:30.168
FEDERAL FUNDING WERE TO BE RE

02:18:30.235 --> 02:18:31.736
DIRECTED THIS PROJECT WOULD

02:18:31.803 --> 02:18:33.238
STILL GO FORWARD IT WOULD JUST

02:18:33.304 --> 02:18:35.674
GO FOR IT AT AT AT A SLOWER PACE

02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:37.575
THAN THIS BREAKNECK SPEED THAT

02:18:37.642 --> 02:18:40.278
WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW --

02:18:40.345 --> 02:18:41.880
IT IS POSSIBLE IF THAT WERE TO

02:18:41.946 --> 02:18:43.415
HAPPEN THAT THESE FINDINGS MAY

02:18:43.481 --> 02:18:45.150
GO ARE THESE POSITIONS MAY GO ON

02:18:45.216 --> 02:18:46.851
FUNDED AROUND FILLED FOR A

02:18:46.918 --> 02:18:48.253
PERIOD OF TIME --

02:18:48.319 --> 02:18:49.754
BUT I THINK THE GREATER RISK

02:18:49.821 --> 02:18:53.091
HERE IS IF WE ARE NOT PREPARED

02:18:53.158 --> 02:18:54.626
AT AND THIS PROJECT DOES MOVE

02:18:54.693 --> 02:18:56.461
FORWARD AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO

02:18:56.528 --> 02:18:57.495
DEAL WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT

02:18:57.562 --> 02:18:58.797
THAT'S REALLY THE GREATER RISK

02:18:58.863 --> 02:19:00.231
HERE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE

02:19:00.298 --> 02:19:01.933
WITH THIS REQUEST. FOR

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.635
REIMBURSABLE FUNDING FIVE

LEVY PROJECT AND THAT IS

02:19:12.977 --> 02:19:15.547
SCHEDULED TO START OUT EARLY

02:19:15.613 --> 02:19:17.916
NEXT YEAR --

THE SACRAMENTO FLOOD CONTROL

02:19:19.284 --> 02:19:21.219
AGENCY BOARD HAS ALREADY AGREED

02:19:21.286 --> 02:19:22.854
TO THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN

02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:24.289
OUTLINED IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST

02:19:24.355 --> 02:19:25.657
