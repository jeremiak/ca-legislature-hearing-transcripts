INFORMATION SECURITY- ENTITIES

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.052
THAT REPORT TO THE EXECUTIVE

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:35.787
BRANCH OR THE GOVERNOR THESE ARE

00:27:35.854 --> 00:27:38.256
THE REPORTING- DEPARTMENTS. AND

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:40.225
WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT THE OTHER

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:41.893
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE NOT THAT

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.397
ARE NOT- REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH

00:27:45.463 --> 00:27:47.065
C. T. T.'S POLICIES AND

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:49.601
GUIDANCE. AND REALLY ASSESS

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:52.537
THERE THE- REALLY THE CONDITION

00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:54.105
OF THEIR SECURITY SYSTEMS AND

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:55.974
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE COMPLYING

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:59.911
WITH THEIR OWN- STANDARDS AND

00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:01.212
FRAMEWORKS. SO WHAT I WANTED TO

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:03.448
DO FIRST IS WALK THROUGH. THE

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:04.983
FINDINGS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.251
RELATED TO THE REPORTING

00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:08.053
ENTITIES AND KIND OF TALK YOU

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:09.454
THROUGH WHAT WE FOUND. SOME OF

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.356
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THERE AND

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:12.924
THEN I'M GONNA WALK THROUGH THE

00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:13.792
RESULTS OF OUR WORK RELATED TO

00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:15.827
THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES AND

00:28:15.894 --> 00:28:17.996
TALK ABOUT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:19.230
- SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE

00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:20.832
FOUND IN OUR AUDIT IS THAT CDT

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:23.468
STILL DOESN'T HAVE. A COMPLETE

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.103
UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATUS OF

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.738
THE STATE'S INFORMATION SECURITY

00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:28.373
SO THAT'S- THAT'S BEEN A LONG

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.775
STANDING PROBLEM. IN ONE OF THE

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:32.744
THINGS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. IF

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:34.712
YOU LOOK AT PAGE TWO OF THE

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:36.347
HEARING DOCUMENT THAT I BELIEVE

00:28:36.414 --> 00:28:38.149
THE SERGEANT PASSED OUT. IT

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:40.085
BASICALLY SHOWS THE FOUR YEAR

00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:43.455
OVERSIGHT. CYCLE THAT CD T. USES

00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:46.224
THIS IS THEIR- PRIMARY MECHANISM

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:48.059
FOR OVERSEEING THE REPORTING

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:50.862
ENTITIES. AND THE CONDITION OF

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:52.964
THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY. AND

00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:54.299
THERE ARE TWO KEY COMPONENTS

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:56.801
THERE ONE CDT USES THE

00:28:56.868 --> 00:28:58.870
EVALUATIONS OF THEIR OWN

00:28:58.937 --> 00:28:59.704
COMPLIANCE AUDITS THAT THEY

00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:01.873
CONDUCT. AS WELL AS THE RESULTS

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.274
OF TECHNICAL SECURITY

00:29:03.341 --> 00:29:04.409
ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE GENERALLY

00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:05.777
PERFORMED BY THE CALIFORNIA

00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:07.645
MILITARY DEPARTMENT. THE USE

00:29:07.712 --> 00:29:09.948
THAT INFORMATION TO CONDUCT THIS

00:29:10.014 --> 00:29:11.649
SCORE IT'S KNOWN AS A MATURITY

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:14.219
METRIC AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT

00:29:14.285 --> 00:29:16.154
PROVIDES A NUMBER THAT REALLY.

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:18.089
DESCRIBES AND SUMMARIZES EACH

00:29:18.156 --> 00:29:19.757
ENTITY IS THE STATUS OF THEIR

00:29:19.824 --> 00:29:21.025
INFORMATION SECURITY

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:23.361
DEVELOPMENT. SO IT'S A VERY

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:25.230
IMPORTANT CALCULATION. BUT WE

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:27.632
FOUND. YOU KNOW WERE INTO REALLY

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:29.901
THE FOURTH YEAR OF THE OVERSIGHT

00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:32.670
CYCLE AND SO AT THIS POINT CD T.

00:29:32.737 --> 00:29:34.372
SHOULD HAVE COMPLETED AUDITS.

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:37.909
AND CALCULATED MATURITY METRICS

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:39.377
FOR THIRTY NINE ENTITIES BUT

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.412
THEY REALLY ONLY COMPLETED

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:42.847
THIRTEEN AUDITS. AND THEY'VE

00:29:42.914 --> 00:29:46.484
ONLY CALCULATE EIGHTEEN OF THESE

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:47.652
IMPORTANT MATURITY METRICS. AND

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.254
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.422
NGUYEN CDT ESTABLISH THIS FOUR

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:53.892
YEAR OVERSIGHT LIFECYCLE THE

00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:56.094
PLAN WAS THAT THEY HAD THE BAND

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:58.997
WITH OR THE RESOURCES TO REVIEW.

00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:00.765
THIRTEEN ENTITIES A YEAR AND

00:30:00.832 --> 00:30:02.333
THAT'S HOW THEY CAME UP WITH THE

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.135
IDEA THAT. THEY COULD LOOK AT

00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:06.804
THE FIFTY TWO HIGHEST RISK

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:08.006
REPORTING ENTITIES OVER THE

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:10.074
FIRST FOUR YEARS. BUT WHAT'S

00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:11.342
HAPPENED OVER THE FIRST THREE

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:12.677
YEARS OF THE LIFE CYCLES ARE

00:30:12.744 --> 00:30:14.412
ONLY AVERAGING TEN COMPLIANCE

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:17.315
AUDITS A YEAR SO THEY'VE GOTTEN

00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:19.918
BEHIND- SO OUR RECOMMENDATION

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:21.319
THERE IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:23.621
IN THAT IS THAT. CD T. REALLY

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:25.990
NEEDS TO INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:27.058
TO COMPLETE THESE COMPLIANCE

00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:29.127
AUDITS OF THE HIGHER RISK

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:30.261
ENTITIES IN A MORE TIMELY

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:31.829
MANNER. AND SO IN OUR

00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:33.598
CONVERSATIONS WITH CDT WHAT

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:35.800
THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA REQUIRE IS

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:36.834
THEY'RE GONNA NEED TO HIRE MORE

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:39.837
STAFF OR THE NEED TO- SECURE

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:41.372
SOME ADDITIONAL CONTRACTED AUDIT

00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:44.042
SUPPORT. I DID WANT TO POINT OUT

00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:47.011
THAT THE FOUR YEAR- OVERSIGHT

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:49.113
LIFECYCLE THOSE TWO COMPONENTS

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.382
THE COMPLIANCE SITES IN THE

00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:53.051
TECHNICAL SECURITY ASSESSMENTS.

00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:54.018
THE TECHNICAL SECURITY

00:30:54.085 --> 00:30:55.620
ASSESSMENTS THOSE ARE REQUIRED

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:58.890
BY STATE LAW. TO HAPPEN THIRTY

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:00.391
FIVE DEPARTMENTS EVERY YEAR HAVE

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:02.527
TO HAVE ONE OF THESE TECHNICAL.

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:04.662
SECURITY ASSESSMENTS AND AS I

00:31:04.729 --> 00:31:05.830
SAID THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:06.998
DEPARTMENT IS GENERALLY

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:08.900
PERFORMING THOSE EVALUATIONS AND

00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:09.934
THOSE ARE HAPPENING AND

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:11.903
HAPPENING AS REQUIRED SO THAT'S

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.438
NOT PART OF THE DELAY THE DELAY

00:31:13.504 --> 00:31:16.174
IS REALLY ABOUT CITIES

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:18.743
COMPLIANCE AUDITS. SECOND THING

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.812
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT.

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:22.447
FOR THOSE ENTITIES THAT ARE ARE

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:24.482
UNDER CD TEASE PURVIEW AS WE

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:26.618
SHOW ON PAGE THREE. THOSE

00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:28.152
ENTITIES RELIEVE THEIR

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:30.021
PERFORMANCE HAS REALLY NOT

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:32.423
IMPROVED AND THEY'RE CONTINUING

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:35.193
TO FALL BELOW BOTH FEDERAL

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.794
STANDARDS AND STATE STANDARDS.

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:39.631
SO LET ME TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL

00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:40.665
STANDARDS FIRST. EVERY YEAR

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.567
REPORTING ENTITIES ARE REQUIRED

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:45.270
TO. CONDUCT THIS FEDERAL SELF

00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:46.938
ASSESSMENTS OF THEIR INFORMATION

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:49.307
SECURITY. IT'S CALLED THE NATION

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:51.175
WIDE REVIEW AND THE PRIMARY

00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:53.544
REASON. THAT THE STATE I THINK

00:31:53.611 --> 00:31:54.746
REQUIRES THESE ENTITIES TO

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:56.547
CONDUCT THE SELF ASSESSMENT. IS

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:58.216
THAT IT'S OF IT'S A MECHANISM

00:31:58.283 --> 00:31:59.951
FOR THE STATE TO GET FEDERAL

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:02.854
GRANTS FOR INFORMATION SECURITY

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.721
. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:05.223
RESULTS OF THE SELF ASSESSMENTS

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.824
WE FOUND OVER THE LAST THREE

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.893
YEARS. STATE DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.529
REALLY FALLING BELOW THOSE

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:12.096
FEDERAL MINIMUM STANDARDS IN

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:14.799
AGAIN. THAT'S BEEN CONSISTENT

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:15.700
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:17.101
THEY'RE NOT HITTING THOSE

00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:19.637
FEDERAL BENCHMARKS. THE OTHER

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:21.205
THING THAT WE LOOKED OUT AND WE

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:23.374
DEPICT ON PAGE THREE IS THESE

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.043
MATURITY METRICS THAT I TALKED

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:27.378
ABOUT EVEN THOUGH CDT HAS ONLY

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:30.315
CONDUCTED- SEVENTEEN OF THOSE

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:32.717
FOR REPORTING ENTITIES FOR

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:33.518
ELEVEN OF THOSE THEY'VE

00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:35.887
SUBSEQUENTLY CONDUCTED FOLLOW UP

00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:37.188
REVIEWS OR THEY'VE HAD

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:38.589
SUBSEQUENT TECHNICAL SECURITY

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:40.425
ASSESSMENTS. SO WHEN THAT

00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:42.126
HAPPENS THE RECALCULATE THE

00:32:42.193 --> 00:32:44.796
MATURITY METRICS SO WE LOOKED AT

00:32:44.862 --> 00:32:46.664
THAT. BECAUSE IT WE HOPE TO SEE

00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:48.900
IS THAT OVER TIME THE MATURITY

00:32:48.966 --> 00:32:51.803
METRIC SCORES WOULD BE IMPROVING

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:53.071
BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T SEE

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:54.472
THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:56.641
GRAPHIC OF THOSE ELEVEN ENTITIES

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:59.444
THAT HAVE HAD. MORE THAN ONE-

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.945
CALCULATION THE MATURITY METRIC

00:33:01.012 --> 00:33:03.481
SCORE ONLY THREE SHOWED ANY

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:06.284
IMPROVEMENT. AND FOR SIX OF THE

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:07.318
ELEVEN THEIR SCORES ACTUALLY

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:09.654
DECLINED WHICH IS. WHICH IS

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:12.223
OBVIOUSLY DISAPPOINTING. THE

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.358
OTHER THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:33:13.424 --> 00:33:16.194
IS. THESE TECHNICAL SECURITY

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.262
ASSESSMENTS WE LOOK AT A HUNDRED

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:19.664
THIRTY FIVE OF THOSE BECAUSE WE

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:20.431
WANTED TO KIND OF ISOLATE THAT

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:21.799
AND FIGURE OUT. ARE THE

00:33:21.866 --> 00:33:23.401
DEPARTMENTS ARE THE IMPROVING

00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:25.203
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THESE

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.903
MORE TECHNICAL SECURITY

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.539
ASSESSMENTS. SO WE LOOK AT THESE

00:33:28.606 --> 00:33:32.577
FOR THE PERIOD OF JANUARY. TWO

00:33:32.643 --> 00:33:33.511
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO MARCH

00:33:33.578 --> 00:33:34.412
TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:36.280
. AND WE FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:39.317
THE STATE ENTITIES ARE SCORING.

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:40.318
FIFTY FOUR OUT OF A HUNDRED

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:42.787
POSSIBLE POINTS. AND THE

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:44.455
CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT.

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:45.990
THEY BASICALLY ARE INDICATING

00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:48.092
THAT A SCORE OF NINETY OR HIGHER

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:49.927
IS THE DESIRED RANGE SO

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:51.829
OBVIOUSLY. THESE REPORTING

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.598
ENTITIES ARE WAY BELOW THAT

00:33:53.664 --> 00:33:57.201
THRESHOLD AND AGAIN OVER THIS.

00:33:57.268 --> 00:33:58.169
THREE YEAR PERIOD THAT WE LOOKED

00:33:58.236 --> 00:33:59.971
AT THEIR PERFORMANCE REALLY

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:02.173
REMAINED FLAT. SO THE OTHER

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.541
THING I WANTED TO POINT OUT IS

00:34:03.608 --> 00:34:05.676
THAT THE INFORMATION THAT CD T.

00:34:05.743 --> 00:34:07.378
DOES HAVE ON THE PERFORMANCE OF

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:08.780
REPORTING ENTITIES THEY'RE

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.181
REALLY NOT DOING A GOOD JOB OF

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:11.783
PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION TO

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:14.218
THE LEGISLATURE. THEY'RE NOT

00:34:14.285 --> 00:34:15.186
PROVIDING INFORMATION ON THE ON

00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:17.722
THE MATURITY METRIC SCORES OR

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:19.791
HOW THOSE ARE CHANGING AND

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:21.225
THEY'RE ALSO NOT PROVIDING ANY

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:23.494
INFORMATION ON. THE STATE

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:26.063
DEPARTMENT'SPERFORMANCE ON

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.832
THESE FEDERAL SELF ASSESSMENTS.

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.300
YOUR RECOMMENDATION AND THAT

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:30.902
AREAS OF THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:33.171
REQUIRE CDT TO CONFIDENTIALLY

00:34:33.237 --> 00:34:35.239
SUBMIT AN ANNUAL STATEWIDE

00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:36.741
INFORMATION SECURITY STATUS

00:34:36.808 --> 00:34:38.976
REPORT. IN THAT STATUS REPORT

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.311
SHOULD INCLUDE THESE MATURITY

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:44.048
METRIC SCORES AND THE RESULTS OF

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:45.650
THE SELF REPORTED EVALUATIONS-

00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:47.018
IN THAT INFORMATION WE THINK

00:34:47.084 --> 00:34:48.119
NEEDS TO BE GOING TO THE

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:49.787
APPROPRIATE- LEGISLATIVE

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:54.091
LEADERSHIP. SO IN THE AREA OF

00:34:54.158 --> 00:34:56.494
THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES. I

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:57.695
THINK SIMILAR TO WHAT WE

00:34:57.762 --> 00:35:00.765
REPORTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:01.666
NINETEEN WE'RE STILL FINDING

00:35:01.732 --> 00:35:02.667
THAT THESE NON REPORTING

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:05.136
ENTITIES ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:07.505
THEIR OWN SHOWS AN INFORMATION

00:35:07.572 --> 00:35:09.373
SECURITY STANDARDS.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.775
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE WHEN WE

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:12.443
SURVEY THIRTY TO THESE NON

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.278
REPORTING ENTITIES WE FOUND THAT

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:16.147
ONLY FOR THESE ENTITIES HAD

00:35:16.214 --> 00:35:18.149
ACHIEVED FULL COMPLIANCE WITH

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:19.050
THEIR CHOSEN INFORMATION

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:21.118
SECURITY STANDARDS WHICH IS

00:35:21.185 --> 00:35:23.421
WHICH IS NOT GOOD. AND WE ALSO

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:25.323
FOUND THAT THREE OF THESE NON

00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:26.724
REPORTING ENTITIES HAD NOT EVEN

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:29.327
ADOPTED ANY INFORMATION SECURITY

00:35:29.393 --> 00:35:31.596
FRAMEWORK OR STANDARDS AT ALL.

00:35:31.662 --> 00:35:33.564
AND SO I THINK CONSISTENT WITH

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:35.867
WHAT WE SET BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:37.535
NINETEEN. WE FOUND THAT THE NON

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:38.569
REPORTING ENTITIES THERE

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:41.038
CURRENTLY IS NO COMPREHENSIVE

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:43.674
EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT MECHANISM

00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:44.342
OTHER INFORMATION SECURITY

00:35:44.408 --> 00:35:46.744
STATUS. AND WE FOUND THAT WHEN

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:48.446
THERE IS THIS EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT

00:35:48.513 --> 00:35:50.715
IT IMPROVES INFORMATION SECURITY

00:35:50.781 --> 00:35:54.118
PERFORMANCE. SO GIVEN THAT

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:55.219
BACKDROP AND JUST THE FACT THAT

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:57.955
THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES HAVE

00:35:58.022 --> 00:35:59.724
REALLY FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE HAS

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.225
REMAINED STAGNANT THEY REALLY

00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:02.627
HAVEN'T MADE ANY PROGRESS IN THE

00:36:02.693 --> 00:36:04.695
LAST TWO YEARS. IN TERMS OF

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:05.897
IMPROVING THEIR INFORMATION

00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:08.332
SECURITY SO GIVEN THAT WE LOOKED

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:10.801
AT A COUPLE OF- OF DIFFERENT

00:36:10.868 --> 00:36:13.638
OPTIONS FOR. IMPROVING THAT AND

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:15.840
ONE OF THOSE WAS WE CONSIDERED

00:36:15.907 --> 00:36:17.475
HAVING MAKING A RECOMMENDATION

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:19.911
THAT MAYBE CD T. SHOULD START

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:21.879
MONITORING THE PERFORMANCE OF

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:24.782
THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES- BUT

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:26.317
THE DISADVANTAGE OF THAT IS AS I

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:28.753
JUST DESCRIBED. THE CD TEES

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.555
OVERSIZED REPORTING ENTITIES

00:36:30.621 --> 00:36:32.156
THEMSELVES HAS SO FAR BEEN

00:36:32.223 --> 00:36:33.925
INADEQUATE AND I'M NOT SURE THEY

00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:36.127
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TAKE ON

00:36:36.193 --> 00:36:38.095
THIS ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY-

00:36:38.162 --> 00:36:39.931
IN ADDITION AS I SAID BEFORE C.

00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:41.165
T. DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THE

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:43.434
AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE. NON

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:46.037
REPORTING ENTITIES TO COMPLY

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:47.438
WITH THEIR WITH THEIR STANDARDS

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:48.539
. AND FINALLY IT'S MY

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:49.840
UNDERSTANDING THAT IN THE PAST

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:51.442
THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES HAVE

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:53.411
EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT

00:36:53.477 --> 00:36:56.113
REPORTING TO CD T. THAT SOMEHOW

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.715
IT WOULD IMPEDE ON THEIR

00:36:57.782 --> 00:37:00.217
INDEPENDENCE. SO GIVEN ALL THAT.

00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:01.953
WHAT WE THINKS MAKE SENSE FOR

00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:03.654
THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE NON

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:05.590
REPORTING ENTITIES EVERY NOT

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:07.725
REPORTING ENTITY. TO FORMALLY

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:09.894
ADOPT INFORMATION SECURITY

00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:11.829
STANDARDS AND A FRAMEWORK

00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:12.964
BECAUSE WE'RE STILL SEEING SOME

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.600
ENTITIES LIKE SAID THAT HAVE NOT

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:16.500
YET DONE THAT. AND THAT ALSO

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:18.636
EVERY NON REPORTING ENTITY

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.638
SHOULD ANNUALLY PROVIDE AN

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:22.907
UPDATE ON ITS COMPLIANCE WITH

00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:25.843
ITS ADOPTED STANDARDS- TO

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.545
LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP IN

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:29.413
ADDITION TO THAT I THINK TO

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.315
FURTHER STRENGTHEN- THE

00:37:31.382 --> 00:37:32.350
OVERSIGHT OF THE NON REPORTING

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:34.251
ENTITIES. IS WE THINK THE

00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:35.953
LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THEM TO HAVE

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.622
AN AUDIT OF THEIR INFORMATION

00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:39.490
SECURITY AT LEAST EVERY THREE

00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:41.592
YEARS. AND WE FEEL THAT THE

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:42.893
LEGISLATURE MOVES FOR WITH

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.296
RECOMMENDATION. THEN REALLY IT

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:47.198
WOULD HAVE A SORT OF A STATE

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:49.400
WIDE VIEW OF HOW ALL THE STATE%

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:51.469
ENTITIES ARE DOING IN TERMS OF

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:52.436
THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:53.871
BECAUSE THAT WOULD GIVE THE

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:56.140
LEGISLATURE INFORMATION ON. HOW

00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:57.308
THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES ARE

00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:59.076
DOING ANY FOR OTHER RICK

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:00.411
RECOMMENDATION IS IMPLEMENTED

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:01.812
FOR THE REPORTING ENTITIES YOU

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:04.515

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:06.684
FULL. SCOPE OF INFORMATION ON

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.519
HOW ALL THE STATE'S ENTITIES ARE

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:11.255
DOING IN TERMS OF PROTECTING

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.256
THEIR DATA. SO WITH THAT I'M

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:13.891
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:15.292

THIS WITH THE NON REPORTING

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:34.045
ENTITIES ITS NOT LIKE WE HAVEN'T

00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:35.413
BEEN TRYING FOR THE LAST FIVE

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:38.949
YEARS. SO WE WILL CONTINUE AND

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:41.285
PERHAPS THIS TIME THE LIGHT WILL

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:43.187
GO ON AYE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO.

HAVE ONE OF ONE QUESTION- FOR

00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:57.968
RIGHT NOW. SO OF REGARDING

00:38:58.035 --> 00:38:59.270
CALIFORNIA'S GENERAL

00:38:59.336 --> 00:39:00.971
CYBERSECURITY POSTURE YOUR OUR

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:02.873
AUDIT FOCUSED ON ASSESSING

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.809
AGAINST OUR OWN- POLICY AND

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:07.411
STANDARDS CAN YOU COMMENT ON HOW

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:09.480
CALIFORNIA COMPARES TO OTHER

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:11.816
STATES- I MEAN PUTTING PUTTING

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:13.150
ANOTHER WHERE WE FALLING BEHIND

00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:17.321
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA- POLICY- IS

00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:18.122
TO MEET HIGH STANDARDS WHILE OUR

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:20.157
PEERS. DO NOT MEET THOSE HIGH

00:39:20.224 --> 00:39:22.626
STANDARDS OR DO WE FALL BEHIND

00:39:22.693 --> 00:39:24.495
OUR PEERS WHO HAVE ALSO ADOPTED

00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:25.663
THESE HIGH STANDARDS I DON'T

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:26.697
KNOW IF YOU'VE LOOKED AT THAT

00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:29.066
BUT- AT LEAST START WITH THAT

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:30.367
ONE SURE I THINK I CAN GET

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:31.702
STARTED WITHOUT SHORTER ONE MY

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:33.237
UNDERSTANDING AND MISTER WORKING

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:35.706
OUT TO THIS. IS THAT I MEAN THE

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.608
STATE STANDARDS THAT ARE IN THE

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:40.244
SAN MANUEL THEY CLOSELY MIRROR

00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:41.679
THERE AT THE RELEVANT THIS

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:42.246
STANDARDS AS WELL AS

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:43.814
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS SO WHEN

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:44.882
WE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:46.617
STANDARDS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AT

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:49.220
THE STATE LEVEL AT THE NATIONAL

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:50.688
LEVEL AND EVEN AT THE

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:51.322
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THERE ARE

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:53.224
BROADLY COMPARE A BULL SO WE

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.925
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY CONCERNS

00:39:54.992 --> 00:39:56.894
WITH THE PARTICULAR STANDARDS

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:58.596
THAT CDT IS REQUIRING THE

00:39:58.662 --> 00:40:02.299
REPORTING. ENTITIES TO COMPLY

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:04.902
WITH. DID YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT THE

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:07.204
STORE. YES- SO WHEN WE AT THE

00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:08.305
NEW WIDE REVIEW. WE IS THE

00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:10.407
FEDERAL SELF ASSESSMENT THAT- IS

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:12.209
PART OF RECEIVING GRANT FUNDING.

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:14.378
SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:17.748
OUT INFORMATION RELATED TO HOW

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:20.050
ENTITIES OR HOW GOVERNMENTS DO

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:22.653
ACROSS LIKE A BROAD RANGE. AND

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.588
WE FOUND THAT WE PERFORM FAIRLY

00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:28.292
COMPARABLY WITH OTHER STATE-

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:30.194
GOVERNMENTS AREN'T ON THAT

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:32.296
REVIEW SO. I WOULD SAY THIS IS A

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:34.632
CHALLENGE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE-

00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:36.367
AND IT BUT WE'RE FOLLOWING VERY

00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:38.435
SIMILAR STANDARDS A LOT OF THE

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:40.805
STANDARDS ARE CLOSELY MIRROR.

00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:42.640
EACH OTHER AND- FOR PERFORMING

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:43.741
ABOUT THE SAME WHICH IS

00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:45.843
UNFORTUNATELY BELOW THAT

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.144
FEDERALLY RECOMMENDED LEVEL.

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:51.382
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:52.583
. THANK YOU APPRECIATED THAT YOU

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:53.684
KNOW JUST LOOKING AFTER GRAPHIC

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:57.655
HERE. AND THE OF THE FIFTY TWO

00:40:57.721 --> 00:40:59.790
ENTITIES THE TO RATIFIED IN THE

00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:03.494
HIGHER RISK- PROVIDE STANDING IS

00:41:03.561 --> 00:41:04.261
THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED AND EIGHT

00:41:04.328 --> 00:41:08.666
ENTITIES. RIGHT AND SO YOU HAVE

00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:11.035
FIFTY TWO WE ACTUALLY HAVE DATA

00:41:11.101 --> 00:41:13.304
ON AND THEN ON THE FIFTY TWO- C.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.473
D. T. ONLY COMPLETED THIRTY ONE

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.641
OF THE THIRTY NINE OUT ITS

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:19.510
SHOULD HAVE FINISHED. AND THEN

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:21.078
IT ONLY DID MATURITY METRIC

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:23.080
SCORES FOR ONLY SEVENTEEN OF

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:25.783
THOSE. SO THEY'VE DONE LESS THAN

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.351
HALF THE WORK THAT THEY NEEDED

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:29.553
TO DO ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT. AND

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.288
EVEN OF THOSE THEY'VE DONE EVEN

00:41:31.355 --> 00:41:34.158
LESS WORK. IN TERMS OF THE AUDIT

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:35.526
NOW WHEN YOU WERE GOING THROUGH

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:38.128
ALL OF THIS AND POINTING ALL OF

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.930
THIS OUT JUST BY THE METRICS.

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:42.733
WHAT WAS THE REASON CDT GAVE FOR

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.669
NOT BEING ABLE TO. MEET THE

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:49.206
EXPECTATIONS. HI MISTER SALAS

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:51.075
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CDT

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:53.277
MENTIONED IS THAT WHEN THEY

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:55.312
INITIALLY DEVELOPED THE FOUR

00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:57.248
YEAR HIGH RISK CYCLE MINOR

00:41:57.314 --> 00:41:59.950
SAYING IS THE INCLUDED SOME NON

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:01.986
REPORTING ENTITIES IN THAT SCOPE

00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:03.520
AND APPARENTLY WHEN THEY PLAN

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:05.189
OUT THESE AUDITS THE PLAN THESE

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:06.457
THINGS I GUESS MONTHS IN ADVANCE

00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:08.125
THE COME UP WITH AN AUDIT PLAN.

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:10.327
IN ONE OTHER EXPLANATIONS WAS

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:11.028
THAT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO

00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:12.963
CONDUCT THE AUDIT SOME OF THESE

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.565
NON REPORTING ENTITIES THAT WERE

00:42:14.632 --> 00:42:16.200
LIKE A PART OF THEIR AUDIT PLAN

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:18.569
DECIDED NOT TO PARTICIPATE AND

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:20.571
SO CITIES EXPLANATION WAS THAT

00:42:20.638 --> 00:42:21.705
BECAUSE THAT HAPPENED LATE IN

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:23.841
THE GAME THEY DIDN'T HAVE TIME

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:26.877
TO LINE UP OTHER- BASICALLY

00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:28.279
OTHER DEPARTMENTS FOR AN AUDIT

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:29.280
SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:31.315
EXPLANATIONS THAT THEY HAD. AND

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:33.050
THEN OTHERWISE OUR UNDERSTANDING

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:34.351
WAS THEY JUST REALLY WEREN'T

00:42:34.418 --> 00:42:36.654
STAFFED UP TO DO THIRTEEN OF

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.554
THESE A YEAR WHICH WAS THEIR

00:42:37.621 --> 00:42:39.924
ORIGINAL PLAN OVER THE FIRST

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.292
THREE YEARS OF THIS FOUR YEAR

00:42:41.358 --> 00:42:42.626
LIFE CYCLE THEY'RE AVERAGING

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:45.095
ONLY TEN SO WE TALK TO THEM

00:42:45.162 --> 00:42:46.363
ABOUT THAT AND ASK THEM IS IT A

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.365
QUESTION OF DO THEY NEED MORE

00:42:48.432 --> 00:42:51.035
STAFF DO THEY NEED CONTRACTED

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:55.306
STAFF. AND- THEY THEY THEY KIND

00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:59.009
OF RESPONDED THAT THE- I DON'T

00:42:59.076 --> 00:42:59.977
KNOW THAT THEY REALLY HAD A

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:01.712
GREAT EXPLANATION FOR WHY THEY

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:02.780
WEREN'T ON PASTY EVERYTHING TO

00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:06.250
ADD TO THAT MISTER WORD SO-

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:07.718
THERE IS THE NON REPORTING ISSUE

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:10.788
THAT. CAUSE SOME DELAYS ANOTHER

00:43:10.854 --> 00:43:12.456
DELAY ESPECIALLY THE DISCREPANCY

00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:13.691
BETWEEN THE THIRTY ONE AUDITS IN

00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:16.260
THE EIGHTEEN MATURITY METRICS

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:17.294
SEVENTEEN OF WHICH WERE

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:18.996
REPORTING ENTITIES THAT WAS

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:20.597
LARGELY BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:22.099
WAS A CHANGE IN THE AUDIT

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:23.634
REQUIREMENTS SO ALTHOUGH THE

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:25.302
MATURITY METRIC SCORING WAS

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:26.704
ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE FOUR YEAR

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:30.574
CYCLE STARTED. IT INCLUDED- NEW

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.309
CONTROLS BASED ON A REVISION OF

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:33.877
NESS THEY INCLUDED PRIVACY

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:37.147
CONTROLS- THOSE CONTROLS WEREN'T

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:39.316
INCLUDED IN THAT FIRST YEAR

00:43:39.383 --> 00:43:41.018
AUDIT PROGRAM SO THEY FINISHED

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:43.854
THE NUMBER OF AUDITS- NINE

00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:45.522
AUDITS THAT. THEY ACTUALLY CAN'T

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:47.124
CALCULATE THE MATURITY METRICS

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:48.392
ON EVEN THOUGH THE CRITERIA WAS

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:50.861
ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE AUDITS-

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:53.998
AND THAT'S CAUSED A DELAY. IN

00:43:54.064 --> 00:43:55.165
AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THEY GO

00:43:55.232 --> 00:43:59.536
BACK IN. AND SCORE THOSE ON THE

00:43:59.603 --> 00:44:00.537
PRIVACY CONTROL SO THAT THEY'RE

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:02.806
ABLE TO CALCULATE THE MATURITY

00:44:02.873 --> 00:44:04.842
METRICS RATHER PRODUCT NIGHT-

00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:07.544
PRECIADO BUT YOU KNOW. WE HAVE A

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:08.679
AND EIGHT REPORTING ENTITIES AND

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:09.580
THEN WHEN I EVEN TALKING ABOUT

00:44:09.646 --> 00:44:11.382
THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES AND I

00:44:11.448 --> 00:44:12.916
DON'T WANT TO FUSE THE TWO. BUT

00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.918
EVEN OF YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:17.021
ABOUT THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES

00:44:17.087 --> 00:44:19.123
EVEN OF THOSE. YOU KNOW. THEY'VE

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:20.624
ONLY YOU ONLY HAVE PARTIAL

00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:21.725
INFORMATION FOR TWENTY FOUR OF

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:23.861
THEM. RIGHT AND THAT'S NOT EVEN

00:44:23.927 --> 00:44:25.863
COUNTING ALL OF THEM SO I'M JUST

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:27.531
CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THEY TOLD.

00:44:27.598 --> 00:44:29.500
THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE WHY

00:44:29.566 --> 00:44:31.201
THEY WEREN'T COMPLIANT WHAT THE

00:44:31.268 --> 00:44:33.771
ISSUE WAS YOU ASKED IF IT WAS

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:35.005
STAFFING- I DON'T THINK IT WAS A

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:36.974
DEFINITIVE ANSWER. AS TO WHY

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.442
THAT WAS- WOULD WE CALL THEM UP

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:41.278
I'D LOVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:43.247
QUESTION. BUT BUT NO I

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:45.416
APPRECIATE THAT THE- YEAH I DID

00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:50.354
WANT TO ASK- FOR THE NON. THE

00:44:50.421 --> 00:44:53.557
NON COMPLIANT REPORTING. WHO'S

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:55.292
ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE IS CVT

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.661
RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE I KNOW IN

00:44:57.728 --> 00:44:58.562
THE PAST I THINK AND PASSED

00:44:58.629 --> 00:44:59.997
HEARING THEY SAID- THEY MAKE

00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:02.699
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WERE YOU

00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:05.702
GUYS ABLE TO LOOK INTO- HOW DO

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:08.105
WE- BRIDGE THAT GAP. SO MY

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:10.641
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CD T.

00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:12.810
DOESN'T HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:14.378
OVERSEEING THE NON REPORTING

00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:16.213
ENTITIES. I MEAN THESE ARE

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.316
LARGELY- CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:22.352
AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH- SO

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:24.054
THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO FOLLOW

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:26.256
THE CDC'S REQUIREMENTS THEIR

00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:29.726
POLICIES THEIR PROCEDURES. SO I

00:45:29.793 --> 00:45:31.028
THINK THE WAY I MEAN IN OUR

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:32.763
DISCUSSIONS WITH C. T. THEY JUST

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:33.597
THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE

00:45:33.664 --> 00:45:35.833
RESPONSIBILITY AT THE MOMENT

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:38.168
OVER THIS NOT REPORTING ENTITIES

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:41.138
. PRODUCT THANK YOU AND JUST ONE

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:46.243
FINAL QUESTION IF I MAY- YOU

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.678
MENTIONED EARLIER MR TELL THEM

00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:50.180
ABOUT THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY

00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:52.316
OF YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS OF. IN

00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:53.717
YOUR AUDIT WERE YOU ABLE TO

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:57.221
IDENTIFY HOW MANY TIMES- THERE

00:45:57.287 --> 00:45:59.389
WAS POSSIBLE DATA BREACHES ARE

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:01.125
THERE WAS AN ACTUAL DATA BREACH.

00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:04.061
AND HE DRIVES AND THAT'S PART OF

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:05.262
THE METRIC BUT HOW MANY TIMES IS

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:07.698
THAT CORRECTED YOU KNOW ARE WE

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:10.234
ARE IS A DEPARTMENT DOING IS CD

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.102
T. DOING EVERYTHING IN. YOUR

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:14.938
OPINION THAT THEY NEED TO DO TO

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.874
PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S PRIVACY. SO

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.642
WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION A

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:21.211
REPORT ABOUT SOME- EVENTS THAT

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.913
HAPPENED SOME CYBER SECURITY

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.381
EVENTS THAT HAPPENED I THINK IN

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:25.749
THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:28.051
PUBLIC SECTOR- BUT MR WORKING

00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:29.520
PROBABLY HAD MORE DETAIL HERE MY

00:46:29.586 --> 00:46:31.655
UNDERSTANDING FROM WHAT WE DID.

00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:33.557
IS WE WERE REALLY LOOKING AT.

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.459
THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND

00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:36.660
TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE

00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:38.529
REPORTING IN THE NON REPORTING

00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:39.530
ENTITIES HAD POLICIES AND

00:46:39.596 --> 00:46:42.399
PROCEDURES. IN PLACE THAT WOULD

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:43.433
PROPEL PROTECT THEIR

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.869
INFORMATIONAL DATA. BUT I DON'T

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:47.137
BELIEVE THAT WE DID ANY DRILL

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:49.239
DOWN WORK OR DENSIFIED ANY

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:52.442
ACTUAL- CYBER SECURITY EVENTS IS

00:46:52.509 --> 00:46:54.278
THAT CORRECT MR WORD YET SO WE

00:46:54.344 --> 00:46:55.779
DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT THE-

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:57.614
THE RESPONSE TO CYBER SECURITY

00:46:57.681 --> 00:46:59.316
EVENTS OR OR THE FREQUENCY OF

00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:01.685
OCCURRENCE- WE PRIMARILY FOCUSED

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:03.820
ON. CD'S OVERSIGHT WHICH

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:05.022
INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

00:47:05.088 --> 00:47:06.690
PROCEDURES ARE EVALUATED THROUGH

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:09.993
THE- AUDIT PROGRAMS ALSO HIGHLY

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.096
TECHNICAL- MILITARY ASSESSMENTS.

00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:14.598
THERE ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL BUT

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:16.333
WE DIDN'T GO IN AND EVALUATE

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.868
THAT WE LOOKED AT WHAT WAS BEING

00:47:17.935 --> 00:47:21.538
DONE TO EVALUATE. AND ENTITIES

00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:22.806
AND ARE THEY ARE THEY IMPROVING

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:24.508
ARE THEY NOT AND WE FOUND THAT

00:47:24.575 --> 00:47:25.976
THEY WERE NOT IT SO YOU'RE

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:27.177
LOOKING AT THE POLICY AND

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:28.111
GUIDELINES AS OPPOSED TO HOW

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:37.187
OF THOSE AND YOU KNOW WE READ

HERE- AS PART OF THE JOINT

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:11.555
LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEES SO

DEFAULT. SO I HAVE GREAT RESPECT

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:20.397

PLEASE INDULGE ME. WITHIN FORTY

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:40.851
EIGHT HOURS I COULD PUT TOGETHER

. A HACKER GROUP THAT COULD GET

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:47.057
INTO ANY. CYBER SECURITY THAT

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:48.925
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:51.862
TRUST ME IF THAT WOULD BE

00:48:51.928 --> 00:48:54.264
CONSIDERED AN AUDIT THAT WOULD

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:57.100
BE GREAT SO THE POINT I'M MAKING

00:48:57.167 --> 00:48:58.902
IS IT'S LIKE IN A MILITARY

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:02.939
MILITARY HAS WAR GAMES IN ORDER

00:49:03.006 --> 00:49:05.475
TO TEST THEIR SYSTEMS THEN THEY

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:08.245
DO. A QUICK AND DIRTY BRIEFING

00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:09.646
TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG WHAT

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:14.851

HACK KINDLE THE SYSTEMS. AND

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:25.595
THAT WAY YOU KNOW. WHERE THE

00:49:25.662 --> 00:49:28.231
WEAKNESSES ARE IT BECOMES REAL

00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:31.201
LIFE TO EACH ENTITY THAT YOU

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:35.305
VOTED VERY WELL SO. WHAT'S

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:39.276
INTERESTING IF. WE PUT TOGETHER

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:42.946
A PACKING COMMITTEE OF KIDS

00:49:43.013 --> 00:49:46.750
THEY'RE ALL KIDS- I'M SERIOUS

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:48.251
WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS IF YOU

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:50.887
GAVE THEM THE GO AHEAD TO DO IT

00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:53.423
LEGALLY THEY WOULD BE IN EVERY.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:57.361
ORGANIZATION AND- UNDER

00:49:57.427 --> 00:50:00.964
SUPERVISION. MAYBE ADULT

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:03.166
SUPERVISION EVEN WHO KNOWS.

00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:04.668
ANYWAY THAT'S MY COMMENTS THANK

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:09.339
YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO JUST- FOLLOW

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:10.774
UP ON THAT THAT IS SO YOU

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:11.708
MENTIONED OF THE PEN TESTING

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:13.610
THAT THE- SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:16.947
DONE MOSTLY BY THE- THE MILITARY

00:50:17.013 --> 00:50:19.683
DEPARTMENT AND THAT THEY ARENOT

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:21.985
NECESSARILY THOSE TESTS ARE THE

00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:23.220
RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:25.155
IMPROVING BUT IT COULD BE THE

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:27.157
RESULT OF. ADDITIONAL

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:28.925
VULNERABILITIES AND LACK OF

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:30.560
PATCHING RIGHT SO NOT

00:50:30.627 --> 00:50:32.863
NECESSARILY ANY ISSUE WITH

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:34.965
WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.366
I MEAN IT COULD BE SOME OF IT

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:37.567
COULD BE WHETHER DEPARTMENT IS

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:39.736
DOING BETTER OR WORSE BUT SOME

00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:40.704
OF THE CALLS OF THE- ARE

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:41.838
VULNERABILITIES THAT WERE

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:44.040
DISCOVERED BY. ME BASICALLY THAT

00:50:44.107 --> 00:50:45.942
THEY ARE DOING HACKING RIGHT.

00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:47.744
THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT IS.

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.679
BASICALLY DOING HAPPEN WHEN THEY

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:52.215
DO THE TESTING. DOES THAT MEAN

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:54.151
THE COULD THAT BE WHAT ARE THE

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:56.019
REASONS THAT THE THOSE- SECURITY

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.954
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE-

00:50:58.021 --> 00:51:00.957
KEEPING UP ON THOSE. ACCORDING

00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:03.527
TO- THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED SO

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:04.694
WHAT ARE REASONS THAT THOSE

00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:05.729
TESTS MIGHT GO DOWN YEAH I MEAN

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:07.197
THAT'S THE THING WHEN WE LOOKED

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:08.398
AT THE RESULTS OF THE

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:09.566
INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:12.636
THAT AS YOU SAY THE CALIFORNIA

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:14.037
DEPARTMENT MILITARY CONDUCTS. I

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:15.972
MEAN THERE ACCORDING TO THEIR

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:18.041
OWN GUIDELINES THE GOAL IS FOR

00:51:18.108 --> 00:51:20.076
THESE DEPARTMENTS TO SCORE IN

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:21.611
THIS NINETY TO A HUNDRED RANGE.

00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:22.879
AND SO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:24.948
HITTING ABOUT FIFTY FOUR OUT OF

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:28.084
A HUNDRED OVER ALL THREE YEARS

00:51:28.151 --> 00:51:30.821
FAIRLY CONSISTENTLY- IS

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:33.190
TROUBLING SO THEY'RE A LONG WAYS

00:51:33.256 --> 00:51:35.692
FROM THE MARK AND I THINK. BASED

00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:37.294
ON. OTHER STUFF THAT WE DID IN

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.995
THE AUDIT THAT WE TOOK A LOOK AT

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:41.097
IT SEEMS LIKE THE DISCONNECT IS

00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:42.098
THAT MANY OF THESE DEPARTMENTS

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:44.334
THEY HAVE. INFORMATION SECURITY

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:45.969
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THEY

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:47.404
HAVE LAID THAT FOUNDATIONAL

00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:49.172
GROUNDWORK. BUT THEY HAVEN'T

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:50.507
GOTTEN TO A PLACE WHERE THEY'VE

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:52.609
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THOSE

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:53.210
POLICIES PROCEDURES AND THOSE

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:55.212
PRACTICES. SO I THINK THAT'S

00:51:55.278 --> 00:51:57.481
PART OF WHY THEY'RE NOT DOING

00:51:57.547 --> 00:52:00.050
VERY WELL ON THE- THE- TECHNICAL

00:52:00.116 --> 00:52:02.052
SECURITY ASSESSMENTS. IS THERE

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:03.420
ANYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE TO ADD TO

00:52:03.487 --> 00:52:04.654
THAT MISTER WARD ABOUT THOSE

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:06.890
ASSESSMENTS. I THINK THAT'S AN

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:10.327
ACCURATE REPRESENTATION- THE

00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:12.496
THREATS ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING-

00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:14.164
BUT THAT'S WHAT CAN BE THE VALUE

00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:15.732
OF THOSE MATURITY METRICS OR

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:17.734
STANDARD SCORE RANGES SO.

00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:20.403
YESTERDAY YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:23.440
NEW TYPES OF THREATS BUT- THERE

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:24.207
SCORING SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:26.776
THAT. THAT DESIRED RANGE BOTH

00:52:26.843 --> 00:52:29.246
IN. THE TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:33.383
AND- SELF ASSESSMENTS AND-

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:36.286
AUDITS THAT LOOK MORE AT THE

00:52:36.353 --> 00:52:37.787

GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENT MORE AND

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:05.442
MORE TECHNOLOGY TO THE POINT

THAT IT IS NOW IN IRAQ IN MOST

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:08.445
OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE

PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS ONE

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.781
OF THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT

MAKES OUR STATE GOVERNMENT

00:54:13.483 --> 00:54:15.752

OUT IS QUICKLY- MATURING DEVELOP

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:25.962
AND THE THREAT LANDSCAPE THAT'S

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:27.897
IN FRONT OF US IS VERY COMPLEX

00:54:27.964 --> 00:54:29.599
AND VERY BROAD BECAUSE OF THAT

00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:32.769
CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM THAT MR

00:54:32.836 --> 00:54:36.373
AND IT'S RUNS POOREST IS BURIED

00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:40.810
HAS MANY AND SCO AUTO FOCUSES ON

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:42.512
ONE COMPONENT OR ONE SLICE OF

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:44.514
THAT PIE WHICH IS THE SECURITY

FIFTY ENTITIES AND STAY. ABOUT A

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:01.264
HUNDRED NAVAL HUNDRED OUR GOALS

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.576
APPLY SECURE PRACTICE WITHIN

00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:16.212
THAT WE PER NARROWED DOWN GROUP

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:20.850
TO BE FIFTY TWO HI SICK I RISK

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:23.553
TYPE ENTITIES THAT WE REALLY ARE

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.289
EXERCER THE AUDIT ALL THE OTHER

OF THE WHITE OH EIGHT THAT ARE

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:33.163
AT RISK R. AND I LOWER. OF A SET

00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:35.965
THIS GET THE MORE ASSESSMENTS

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:37.267
THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE AUDIT

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:41.571
PRO BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE I-

00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:43.440
SIX THAT ARE OUT AND AS AS YOU

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:46.910
CAN IN CYBER ONCE I FITS ALL IS

00:55:46.976 --> 00:55:48.812
NOW APPROPRIATE THE ACTUAL THAT

00:55:48.878 --> 00:55:52.382
WE FOR SYSTEMS THAT PERSONAL.

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:59.756
AND HELP. OR STATE OFFICE

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:02.792
LOCATIONS SO IT IS A TIERED

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:05.161
MECHANISM INTENTIONALLY AND SO

00:56:05.228 --> 00:56:07.530
AS WE CONDUCT THESE AUDITS AND

00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:08.865
ACTUALLY I THINK MISTER TOLD AN

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:10.900
ACCIDENT- SPOKE YOU SEPARATE

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:12.769
COMPLETED THIRTEEN THE NUMBER IS

00:56:12.836 --> 00:56:16.239
ACTUALLY THIRTY ONE AT ONE ONE

00:56:16.306 --> 00:56:17.774
OF THOSE AUDITS OF MISTER CELLS

00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:20.810
ACTUALLY CORRECTED THAT AS WELL-

00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:23.146
AS WE GO THROUGH THOSE AUDITS WE

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:25.115
HAVE STAFF TO OUR PROGRAM TO

00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:27.784
CONDUCT- ESSENTIALLY A QUARTER

00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:29.219
OF THOSE AUDITS OF HIGH RISK

00:56:29.285 --> 00:56:33.656
ENTITIES EACH YEAR. ON A FOUR

00:56:33.723 --> 00:56:34.290
YEAR CYCLE. IT IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:56:34.357 --> 00:56:36.192
THAT THAT THAT AUDIT REALLY IS

00:56:36.259 --> 00:56:38.461
PROCESS AND PROCEDURE AUDITS AND

00:56:38.528 --> 00:56:39.229
THE POLICY HUNDRED OF THOSE

00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:40.730
ORGANIZATIONS IT IS NOT

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:42.432
MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:45.869
THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE

00:56:45.935 --> 00:56:48.404
EXECUTION OF THOSE POLICIES M.

00:56:48.471 --> 00:56:51.407
S. AS MR BALL JOINTED OUT YEAH

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:53.042
WE DO HAVE THE MILITARY

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:54.677
ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:57.714
COMING IN AND INTENTIONALLY TRY.

00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:00.850
TO OPT. BREAK THROUGH AND ENTER

00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:03.153
THOSE SYSTEMS AND EXERCISE THAT

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:04.721
BUT THAT IS REALLY NOT THE FOCUS

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:07.757
OF THIS REPORT- SO THAT THE

00:57:07.824 --> 00:57:09.959
PROGRAM IN SUMMARY IS VERY BROAD

00:57:10.026 --> 00:57:14.597
WE'RE FOCUSING ON JUST. ONE

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:15.565
PIECE AS WE TALK THROUGH THIS.

00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:18.334
D. OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:19.402
OUT IS OUR THREAT LANDSCAPE IS

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:20.537
CONSTANTLY CHANGING AGAIN

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:21.938
BECAUSE WE USE SO MUCH

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:24.240
TECHNOLOGY BUT THE STATE OF THE

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:25.375
WORLD IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:27.710
JUST SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.579
PANDEMIC. WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBER

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:31.481
OF ATTACKS AGAINST OUR SYSTEMS

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:33.349

WHY OF THE HUNDRED AND EIGHT

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:42.471
REPORTING ENTITIES ARE THAT

01:15:42.537 --> 01:15:44.506
WE'VE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN ONES IS

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:48.710
HIGH RISK AND LOW RISK BUT- WHY

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:51.146

. WE'RE ACTUALLY ON PACE OF THE

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:21.810
HIGH RISK ENTITIES. TO ACHIEVE

01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:24.313
FORTY EIGHT OF THE- FIFTY TWO

01:16:24.379 --> 01:16:26.248
THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. SO THEY'RE

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:28.450
CORRECT IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:30.018
OF THE PROGRAM WE ACCOMPLISH

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:32.354
THIRTY ONE. OF THE THIRTY NINE

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.256

THE END OF YOUR THREE WERE

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.827
ACTUALLY WHITE SO. SO WE ARE ON

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:41.563
PACE. TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:43.932
ALMOST ALL OF THE ENTITIES ARE.

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:46.268
THE FOR YOUR COMPOST ARE

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:48.036
ACTUALLY ESSENTIALLY PUSHING

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.104
BACK AND SAYING THEY'RE NOT

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:51.106
SUBJECT TO THE ARTICLES SO WE'RE

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:53.342
IN OUR VIEW WE ARE ACTUALLY NOT

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.377
BEHIND A HIGH RISK AUDITS. AGAIN

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.846
THE REST OF THE HUNDRED KNIGHT

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:00.215
ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AN AUDIT SO

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:01.583
THAT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:05.520
PRESSBOX. WONDERWORKER PARKS.

01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:07.956
AND CURRENT STRUCK OKAY WITHIN

01:17:08.023 --> 01:17:09.925
FORTY FORTY EIGHT THE FIFTY TWO

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:10.525
THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED AS HIGH

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:14.463
RISK WILL BE COMPLETED. YES GOT

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:16.164
IT ALL RIGHT AND THEN LET ME

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:18.300
JUST ASK- ALSO YOU KNOW THE

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:20.302
AUDITOR AND SUGGESTED THAT CD T.

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:21.536
USE THE RESULTS OF THE FEDERAL

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:23.138
NATIONWIDE CYBER SECURITY REVIEW

01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:25.007
TO INFORM THE STATUS OF THE

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:27.009
STATE'S INFORMATION SECURITY

01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:28.577
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT CTE

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:30.746
IS ALREADY REQUIRING REPORTING

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:32.981
AGENCIES TO COMPLETE THE

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:34.182
NATIONAL REVIEW EVERY YEAR.

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:35.183
RIGHT I BELIEVE IT'S CONDITION

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:36.685
FOR RECEIVING SOME- GRANT

01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:38.286
FUNDING FROM THE US DEPARTMENT

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:40.188
OF HOMELAND SECURITY. AS THE

01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:42.424
QUESTION IS- WHY DOESN'T CD T.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:44.026
USE THAT INFORMATION TO COULD

01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:45.460
GAIN A CLEARER PICTURE OF THE

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:47.929
STATUS OF THE END. OF THE

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:50.565
STATE'S INFORMATION SECURITY. IN

01:17:50.632 --> 01:17:52.567
THE PAST WE DID NOT INCORPORATE

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:54.002
THAT RECORD BECAUSE IT WAS SELF

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:55.871
REPORTED INFORMATION. BYE WEEK

01:17:55.937 --> 01:17:57.172
KNOWLEDGE THE RECOMMENDATION WE

01:17:57.239 --> 01:18:00.308
THINK IT IS A GOOD INDICATION-

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:01.576
WHICH IS MUCH BETTER THAN

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:03.345
NOTHING AND PLAN TO INCORPORATE

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:04.613
THAT IN THE FUTURE BUT IT HAS

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:05.847
NOT BEEN PART OF THE SECURITY

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:07.816
POLICY THE CYBER SECURITY POLICY

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:09.985
OF THE STATE. UP UNTIL THIS

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:11.420
POINT. ALLEN RIGHT NOW I

01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:13.055
APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK- WE

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:14.089
CAN INTEGRATED IN THE FUTURE

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:15.290
ESPECIALLY IF THAT INFORMATION

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:16.525
IS OUT THERE SO WHETHER IT'S

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:19.194
UNDER THE- ST FIFTY THREE

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:21.096
HUNDRED OR THE SAM- GUIDELINES I

01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:22.397
THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL JUST

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:23.932
GIVE AN OVERALL PICTURE. OF

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:26.835
WHERE WE'RE AT. AT THE STATE IN

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:30.439
TERMS OF SECURITY- I DO WANT TO.

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:32.107
ASK ANOTHER QUESTION IF I MAY

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:33.408

THAT THERE HAVE BEEN AN INCREASE

01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:38.080
IN ATTACKS INCLUDING PHISHING

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:40.816
AND RANSOMWARE- IN THE PAST

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:43.985
YEAR- DCA A CORRELATION BETWEEN

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:46.388
THE ENTITIES UNDER ATTACK. AND

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.257
THE RECENT- SECURITY STATUS MAY

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:52.627
BE WITH THE AUDITS- AND- ALREADY

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:54.596
HAVE THEM. DO ANY OF THEM LOCKED

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:57.999
THE POLICIES UNDER THE STATE

01:18:58.066 --> 01:19:00.936
AUDITOR'S REVIEW. LET ME DEFER

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:02.771

THERE WAS THERE IS GENERALLY AN

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.447
INCREASE IN SOME OF THESE

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:14.850
INCIDENTS. WHICH IS WHY OVER THE

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:16.318
LAST YEAR AND A HALF WE'VE BUILT

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:19.154
UP. IT'S A SOPHISTICATED

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:21.490
INCIDENT RESPONSE CAPABILITY THE

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:24.259

BAD ACTORS AND IN THIS SOCIETY

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:12.387

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:32.400
OF ZERO TO FOUR CIVIC KIND OF

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:34.102
EXPLAIN. DESERVE A MISSING

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:35.670
ISRAEL'S WORSENED FOR IS

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:38.373
EXCEPTIONAL- BUT KIND OF WHERE

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:39.641
WE'RE AT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:41.609
YOU LOOK AT IT WE ONLY HAD

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:42.844
SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN BUT

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.946
ACTUALLY THAT YOU ACTUALLY

THAT A CERTAIN POINT POINT IN

01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:53.988
TIME LAST YEAR AS WAS MENTIONED

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:56.391
. WE DID HAVE OR WHAT WE ARE ON

METRICS AS A RESULT FROM BOTH

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:05.400
AUDITS AND ASSESSMENTS. AND JUST

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:06.968
TO REITERATE KIND OF THE SCALE

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:10.371
OF THESE METRICS OF IT SCALES

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:13.208
FROM ZERO TO A FOR. ZERO IT

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.543
MEANS YOU'RE DOING NOTHING IN A

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:16.211
PARTICULAR SECURITY CONTROL

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:19.047
CATEGORY A ONE MEANS YOU HAVE

01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:21.816

HAVEN'T AND ASSOCIATED

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:25.887
PROCESSING PROCEDURE. IN A THREE

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.522
AND A FOUR GENERALLY IS THE

WITHIN A SECURITY CONTROL

01:25:32.927 --> 01:25:35.797
CATEGORY. OFTENTIMES THE ISSUE

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:37.632
IS THAT AN ENTITY OR DEPARTMENT

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:39.434
MAY NOT BE MATURE AND HAVING A

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:42.437
POLICY STANDARD PROCEDURE. BUT

01:25:42.504 --> 01:25:45.039
MAY PERFORM WELL IN A SECURITY

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:46.441
CONTROL CATEGORY WITHOUT A

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:48.042
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SO

01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:50.645
GENERALLY BY THE VERY NATURE

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:54.916
METRICS. WOULD BE SCORED LOWER.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:56.317
THAT THAN WHAT THEY'RE IS

01:25:56.384 --> 01:25:58.419
POSTURE. WHAT WOULD REALLY BE IN

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.221
REALITY SO WE SPECIFICALLY

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:02.223
DESIGNED THAT THE ELECTRIC

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:06.060
METHODOLOGY TO ENCOURAGE AND THE

01:26:06.127 --> 01:26:07.595
PUSH DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.864
THEY ALSO FOCUS ON POLICIES

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:11.866
STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES WHICH

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:14.002
ULTIMATELY LEADS LEAD TO YOUR

01:26:14.068 --> 01:26:15.770
OVERALL LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:17.739
OF YOUR SECURITY. POSTURE IN

GET AT THE END OF THE ROAD BASED

01:26:28.816 --> 01:26:30.552
UPON THE- SO IT'S A BALANCE AND

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:32.120
THAT THAT IS WHY WE OFTEN KIND

01:26:32.186 --> 01:26:33.955
UNDER RAVEL THE METHODOLOGY AND

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:35.523
LOOK AT. LOOK AT ASSESSMENT

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:38.893
SCORES INDEPENDENTLY AS WE ALSO

ENCOMPASSED THE POLICIES AND

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:45.500
PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES SO BUT

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:47.502
BOTH. BOTH FRONTS ARE NEEDED OR

01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:49.804
BOTH EFFORTS ARE NEEDED SO WE

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:51.306
GENERALLY DE COUPLE THE COUPLE

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.675
ARE BENCHMARKS. IT'S A REALLY

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:56.144
DEAL WITH THE IMMINENT THREAT

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:57.612
SECONDHAND. PRODUCT THANK YOU

ORGANIZATION SO THAT THAT'S ONE

01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:40.348
MEASURE. I MEASURE IS- FOCUSING

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:12.980
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU SAID A

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:14.816
MINIMUM OF THE TWO- I MEAN IS IT

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:16.084
REALLY JUST IMPLEMENTING THESE

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:18.019
POLICIES IS GOING TO TAKE. MORE

01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:19.854
BUDDY YOU TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:22.557
DEVELOPMENT. BUT HOW DO WE HOW

01:29:22.623 --> 01:29:24.325
DO WE GET THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:25.560
IT'S LOW OF THE SERVING ONE SOME

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.328
HAVE SHOWN NO MOVEMENT AND WE'VE

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:28.262
BEEN DOING THIS SINCE TWENTY

01:29:28.329 --> 01:29:31.365
THIRTEEN. SOME OF THE CLIENT-

01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:33.067
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AT HOW DO

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:39.340
WE- FIX THIS. STILL THE PLAN

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:41.743
IT'S REALLY TO ALIGN ENTITIES

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:42.610
AND SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:44.812

TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP IN AND ON.

01:29:55.423 --> 01:29:57.358
AND I WORKFORCE ROAD MATH SO WE

01:29:57.425 --> 01:29:58.192
REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:29:58.259 --> 01:29:59.961
SUPPORTER DEPARTMENTS AND

01:30:00.027 --> 01:30:01.262
BUILDING UP THEIR SECURITY

AS IT AS IT IS MAPPED TO CAL

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:10.571
SECURE. SO MR SAUCE ON ME MAYBE.

01:30:10.638 --> 01:30:11.906
A LITTLE WORK ON A TRUCK WITH

PRIOR TO. CAL SECURE PLAN LAST

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:16.911
FALL DEPARTMENTS REALLY OPERATE

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:18.846
WITHIN THOSE POLICIES ARE

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:21.482
WITHOUT. OVER GUIDANCE FROM FROM

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:23.084
DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY NEED NOT

GIVING THEM A ROAD MAP THE

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:26.020
CONNECTED WHERE THEY ARE TO

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:28.089
WHERE WE WANT THEM TO BE. THAT

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:28.623
IS THE INTENT OF THAT CAL

01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:30.458
SECURE. TO ESSENTIALLY LAID OUT

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:32.393
AS A SERIES OF OBJECTIVES WE'RE

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:37.765
GOING. TO COMPLETE. ENGINE THE

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:41.235
FUNDING BACK THAT MR AND-

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:43.771

MOVEMENT ALONG THOSE ROADS THAT

01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:50.444
. AND SO WE'RE NOT A POOR YET

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:53.915
WHERE WE KNOW. IF IS A GAP THERE

01:30:53.981 --> 01:30:56.551
- THAT WILL OF ALL WILL THE NEXT

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.252
YEAR TO TWO YEARS TO SEE WHERE

01:30:58.319 --> 01:31:00.721
THEY ARE IN THE ARE THAT MAKE.

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:03.925
CDT IS- YEAH IN THAT BUSINESS UP

01:31:03.991 --> 01:31:04.725

POLICIES THEM TO FRANKLY THAT'S

01:31:07.228 --> 01:31:09.063
WHY DOES ORDER HAVE. AND

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:11.866
SECURITY WITH THE EACH. IS TO BE

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:16.470
PERFECTLY ALIGNED THERE MODEL.

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:17.171
SO WE WERE PROVIDED THEM NOW

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:19.273

LEVELS THE WOMAN'S. THAT REALLY

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:30.952
START WHICH THE A BIG PIECE OF

01:31:31.018 --> 01:31:32.720
THIS IS IN UPGRADING ESSENTIALLY

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:35.389
CULTURE OR PROCESS. DEBTS

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:37.758
SECURITY GOT TO BE A FUN PART OF

01:31:37.825 --> 01:31:40.528
ANY PROGRAM THAT. SHOULD END IN

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:43.464
THE REAL. HOUSE IS NOT SPECIAL

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:45.933
AN HOUR. THAT WE BRING IN WE ARE

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.001

CHANGING THAT CULTURE- AND I

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:51.405
BELIEVE WE ARE MAKING PROCESS.

01:31:51.472 --> 01:31:54.008
OUR PROGRESS AGAINST THAT

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:55.543
BECAUSE YOU SEE THE METRICS-

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:56.811
WE'RE STAYING YOU KNOW

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:58.246
RELATIVELY STAGNANT AND WITH

01:31:58.312 --> 01:32:00.648
THAT OBSERVATION. WE ARE RAISING

01:32:00.715 --> 01:32:02.416
THE BAR WE'RE WE'RE ACHIEVING

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:04.452
SIMILAR SCORES BUT THOSE SCORES

01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:06.053
ARE AGAINST MORE MORE RIGOROUS

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.289
METRICS AS WE GO. SO WE ARE

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:14.128
IMPROVING. THE SECURITY. A

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:15.763
PROFILE WHICH IS NOW WORK WANT

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:18.366
TO BE. IN A WOULD ALSO. POINT

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:21.002
OUT OR- IN THINGS LIKE THE MILL

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:24.472
IS WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT A SCORE

01:32:24.538 --> 01:32:26.073
CALL. IF ANY SAYS ACTUALLY TO

AND- TWO ON. IT IS ALMOST ON YOU

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.678
SO IT'S QUITE OFTEN. BETWEEN

01:32:30.745 --> 01:32:34.081
INFORMATIONS. AND THE

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:35.383
FUNCTIONALITY THAT WE ARE TRYING

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:36.083
TO DEPLOY WHETHER IT'S

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:37.585
ASSISTANCE INSIDE AN APARTMENT

01:32:37.652 --> 01:32:39.220
OR PUBLIC FACING. IT'S GOT TO BE

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:41.222
USABLE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT NEED

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:43.357

WITH ONE. ARM UP PERFECTLY

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:50.631
SECURE SYSTEM WOULD BE ONE IT'S

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:55.002
SO UNUSABLE NOBODY WHATEVER. TO

01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:57.738
THAT TO EXPERIENCE. YEAH NINE. A

01:32:57.805 --> 01:32:59.907

CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME THE- THE

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:05.546
FUNDAMENTAL. QUESTION THEY

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:07.615
ALWAYS ASK ME IS YOU KNOW I DO

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:09.650

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:24.298
TO- ACTUALLY USE A SYSTEM A YOU

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:26.067

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:48.182
BECOMES A LITTLE BIT MONEY-BECAUSE OF THE REFERENCE SO

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:50.451
WE'RE THREE YEARS. THREE YEARS

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:52.353
COMPLETED IN THAT AUDIT CYCLE

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:54.221
FOR YEARS. AT THE END OF THE

01:34:54.288 --> 01:34:56.090
THIRD YEAR WE COMPLETED THIRTY

01:34:56.157 --> 01:34:58.092
ONE. IT'S THERE WERE OTHER

01:34:58.159 --> 01:35:00.061
AUDITS THAT WERE IN PROCESS BUT

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:01.695
NOT COMPLETED SO IT'S NOT THAT

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:03.664
WE HAVE TO START SEVENTEENTH

01:35:03.731 --> 01:35:04.999
START AND FINISH SEVENTEEN

01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:06.934
AUDITS IN THIS LAST YEAR. WE

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:08.903
HAVE TO COMPLETE THOSE SEVENTEEN

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.571
SO A NUMBER OF THEM WERE VERY

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:11.639
CLOSE TO FINISHING IN THE FIRST

01:35:11.705 --> 01:35:13.174
PLACE. BY THE END OF THE FOUR

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.142
YEAR CYCLE WE ARE ON TASK TO

01:35:15.209 --> 01:35:17.978
COMPLETE FORTY EIGHT OF THE

01:35:18.045 --> 01:35:19.146
FIFTY TWO AUDITS THAT WOULD BE

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:21.816
ON THE HIGH RISK ENTITIES STATE.

01:35:21.882 --> 01:35:24.251
OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT SO YES

01:35:24.318 --> 01:35:26.987
SO BASICALLY RIGHT NOW TO DO

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.389
THAT WORK YOU DON'T SEE THAT YOU

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:31.058
NEED TO. ASSIGN MORE STAFF OR

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:34.295
CONTRACT OUT YOU HAVE THE

01:35:34.361 --> 01:35:35.896
PERSONNEL YOU NEED. THAT'S

01:35:35.963 --> 01:35:39.567
CORRECT OKAY. OF- SINCE MANY OF

01:35:39.633 --> 01:35:42.136
THE A METRIC- CATEGORIES ARE

01:35:42.203 --> 01:35:45.806
SUPPLIED BY. NEED TO SINCE MANY

01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:46.941
OF THE METRIC CATEGORIES ARE

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:48.742
SUPPLID BY AUTO PERFORMANCE HOW

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:50.711
DO YOU CALCULATE A METRIC A

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:52.913
MATURITY METRIC FOR LOW RISK

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:55.549
ENTITIES THAT- DON'T RECEIVE AN

01:35:55.616 --> 01:36:00.688
AUDIT. KELLY WON'T DRESS UP YEAH

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:02.022
NOT SOMETHING WE'RE WE'RE

01:36:02.089 --> 01:36:03.591
CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSIONS ON THE

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:05.626
HUB PLANNING IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:07.461
OUR PLAN WILL BE TO SHORE UP THE

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:10.397
METRICS. SO CURRENTLY WE WOULD

01:36:10.464 --> 01:36:12.666
RELY ON SELF SELF ASSESSMENT

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:15.202
SUBJECTIVE QUESTIONNAIRES AND AT

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:16.770
THIS POINT IN TIME THAT THAT'S

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:19.140
HOW WE WOULD WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:21.342
COLLECT THOSE METRICS. WE ARE

01:36:21.408 --> 01:36:23.310
EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES AND

01:36:23.377 --> 01:36:24.812
CONDUCTING FISCAL ANALYSIS UP ON

01:36:24.879 --> 01:36:28.616
HOW TO. MORE OBJECTIVELY- COVER

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:30.184
THOSE OTHER ENTITIES WITHOUT

01:36:30.251 --> 01:36:32.319
RESORTING TO SUBJECTIVE MEASURES

01:36:32.386 --> 01:36:34.121
LIKE QUESTIONNAIRES AND THAT'S

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:35.089
SOMETHING WE'RE CURRENTLY

01:36:35.156 --> 01:36:37.458
DISCUSSING AS A PLAN OF ACTION

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:40.528
GOING FORWARD. OKAY CITIES

01:36:40.594 --> 01:36:41.695
LETTER NOTES THAT THE METRIC

01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:44.632
DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT- THE

01:36:44.698 --> 01:36:49.370
SOCCER CAL SICK- SERVICES- WHY

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:51.505
IF THAT'S THE CASE THE CDT FEEL

01:36:51.572 --> 01:36:54.875
THAT THESE SERVICES MAY MEDIC-

01:36:54.942 --> 01:36:55.876
MEDICAID A LESS MATURE AND

01:36:55.943 --> 01:37:00.648
EIGHTY. SO WE WERE BUILDING THE

01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:03.184
STATEWIDE SECURITY CONTROLS AS A

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:04.385
COMPENSATING CONTROL FOR

01:37:04.451 --> 01:37:07.521
ENTITIES. REMEMBER WHICH CANNOT

01:37:07.588 --> 01:37:10.057
IMPLEMENT SECURITY CONTROLS

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:13.427
LOCALLY FOR EXAMPLE. CONDUCTING

01:37:13.494 --> 01:37:15.396
INCIDENT RESPONSE PROCESSES

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:17.631
LOCALLY SOMETHING THAT THAT SOME

01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:18.799
OF OUR ENTITIES HAVE NOT BEEN

01:37:18.866 --> 01:37:21.235
ABOUT EXCELLED IN AND THAT WAS

01:37:21.302 --> 01:37:23.737
THE MAIN DRIVER MOTIVATOR AND

01:37:23.804 --> 01:37:25.172
ESTABLISHING A STATEWIDE

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:27.041
INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM SO THAT

01:37:27.107 --> 01:37:29.310
WE CAN DO THAT FOR THEM HOWEVER

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:31.145
THE METRICS SOLELY MEASURE

01:37:31.212 --> 01:37:33.981
DEPARTMENTS. SCORES AND ABILITY

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:35.449
AND MATURITY TO DEAL ON THEIR

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:38.552
OWN WITHOUT STATEWIDE

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:44.124
CENTRALIZED SERVICES. OKAY SO- I

01:37:44.191 --> 01:37:46.060
SHOULD SELL THE SELL THESE

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:47.895
ENTITIES PARTICIPATION WITH THE

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:50.097
SOCCER CAL SICK IMPROVE THEIR

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:56.403
MATURITY. YES IT WILL IMPROVE

01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:58.639
THEIR MATURITY AND THEIR ABILITY

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:00.507
TO BE RESILIENT TO THE THREATS

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:02.776
RATS AND HANDS. OKAY AND THEN

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:04.645
LEVEL THREE I'M SORRY DON'T

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:07.181
DON'T SORRY WE DON'T MEASURE

01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:08.415
THAT IS PART OF THE CURRENT RISK

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:10.517
MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY THAT'S

01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:11.619
AN INDEPENDENT COMPENSATING

01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:13.120
CONTROL THAT THAT HELPS

01:38:13.187 --> 01:38:15.623
DEPARTMENTS. WITH THEIR LACK OF

01:38:15.689 --> 01:38:17.825
FULFILLING A SECURITY CONTROL

01:38:17.891 --> 01:38:22.696
CATEGORY. SO SHORT. MYSTERY AND

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:23.764
IT TO YOUR POINT FRANKLY THERE'S

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:26.033
A GAP IN PART OF THE SCORING

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:29.236
METHODOLOGY WHEN I ESPECIALLY A

01:38:29.303 --> 01:38:30.671
SMALL ORGANIZATION. HOW IT WORKS

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:31.972
WITH OUR SECURITY OPERATIONS

01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:33.440
CENTER TO ACQUIRE SOME OF THOSE

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:36.443
SECURITIES SERVICES ACTUALLY CAL

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:38.579
IN THEIR SECURITY SCORE BECAUSE

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:40.814
THE WAY THE SECURITY SCORE IS

01:38:40.881 --> 01:38:42.483
CALCULATED IS BASED ON WHAT THEY

01:38:42.549 --> 01:38:44.918
DO. AND HENCE FOR SCORING

01:38:44.985 --> 01:38:47.588
METHODOLOGY ACTUALLY DOES NEED

01:38:47.655 --> 01:38:48.756
TO BE UPDATED TO TAKE THAT INTO

01:38:48.822 --> 01:38:51.558
ACCOUNT. RIGHT SO JST. TO

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:53.894
CLARIFY IT ARE HAVE YOU DO YOU

01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:57.197
HAVE MATURITY METRICS FOR ANY

01:38:57.264 --> 01:39:02.303
LOW RISK ENTITIES. FOR NON HIGH

01:39:02.369 --> 01:39:06.340
RISK ENTITIES NO WE DO NOT. WE

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:07.474
WILL RELY ON THE ASSESSMENT

01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:18.252
SCORES. OUR RATE- SO- LET'S SEE

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:23.057
WHAT ELSE. SO I DO I DO I DO

01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:25.225
WANT TO SAY WITH- WE WERE

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:26.994
TALKING ABOUT A BRIEFING OF THE

01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:29.096
LEGISLATURE I'VE APPRECIATED THE

01:39:29.163 --> 01:39:30.998
VOLUNTARY COOPERATION OF THE

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:33.033
ADMINISTRATION AND BRIEFING ME

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:34.835
AND SOME OF MY FORMER COLLEAGUES

01:39:34.902 --> 01:39:37.071
ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. BUT OF

01:39:37.137 --> 01:39:39.840
MORE FORMAL MECHANISM IS A

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:41.475
INTERESTING RECOMMENDATION BY

01:39:41.542 --> 01:39:43.444
THE AUDITOR AS CYBER SECURITY

01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:45.179
MAY BE TOO IMPORTANT OF AN ISSUE

01:39:45.245 --> 01:39:46.914
TO LEAVE TO IT INFORMAL

01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:50.017
REPORTING IS THERE ANY INTEREST

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:51.585
BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO BUILD

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:54.321
UPON OUR CURRENT BRIEFING-

01:39:54.388 --> 01:40:00.427
FORMAT. WE WOULD DEFINITELY BE

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:01.462
INTERESTED IN HAVING A

01:40:01.528 --> 01:40:01.929
CONVERSATION WITH THE

01:40:01.995 --> 01:40:05.666
ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT. I CAN'T

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:07.401
COMMIT TO THAT I HAVE NOT HAD

01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:08.969
THAT CONVERSATION WITH

01:40:09.036 --> 01:40:10.070
GOVERNMENT'S OFFICE PROJECT WILL

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:14.775
PUSH WHAT'S- OKAY. RIGHT I THINK

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:18.011
THAT WE ARE- DONE WITH. THE

01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:22.116
QUESTIONS I REALLY APPRECIATE-

01:40:22.182 --> 01:40:24.651
YOUR TIME AND OF. I DON'T KNOW

01:40:24.718 --> 01:40:25.619
IF THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:26.687
QUESTIONS WHILE WE ARE

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.422
DISCUSSING THE AUDITORS-

01:40:28.489 --> 01:40:31.859
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT- WE WILL

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:35.062
MOVE ON TO THAT. FOR THE AUTO

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:36.930
PAY SO IF WE COULD HAVE YOU COME

01:40:36.997 --> 01:40:55.816
BACK UP.

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:04.792
ALL RIGHTS OF THE

01:41:04.858 --> 01:41:06.160
AUDITOR HAS MADE THREE

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:08.195
RECOMMENDATIONS- TO THE

01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:10.164
LEGISLATURE AND AS I MENTIONED

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:11.331
EARLIER I'VE INTRODUCED TWO

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:13.400
BILLS TO USES VEHICLES FOR.

01:41:13.467 --> 01:41:15.335
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION OF

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:16.670
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS SO I

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:18.439
WANTED TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS

01:41:18.505 --> 01:41:19.540
ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:41:19.606 --> 01:41:21.008
ESPECIALLY RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT

01:41:21.074 --> 01:41:22.876
NON REPORTING ENTITIES WHO.

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:25.312
HAVEN'T GOTTEN AS MUCH OF FOCUS

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:31.151
TODAY. SO- FIRST TO US YES THEY

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:33.020
RECOMMEND FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:41:33.086 --> 01:41:34.788
REQUIRE CDTV TO REPORT

01:41:34.855 --> 01:41:35.889
CONFIDENTIALLY TO THE

01:41:35.956 --> 01:41:37.925
LEGISLATURE IS- TO THE

01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:40.427
LEGISLATURE AND CSR SCORES

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:42.429
IMMATURITY METRIC SCORES AS YOU

01:41:42.496 --> 01:41:46.133
CONSIDERED THESE MORE DETAILED-

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:47.267
INFORMATION THAT STATISTICAL

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:49.303
INFORMATION ABOUT AYE ESSAYS AND

01:41:49.369 --> 01:41:50.037
THE LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY

01:41:50.103 --> 01:41:52.639
RECEIVES SO FIRST IS HOW DO

01:41:52.706 --> 01:41:55.442
THESE TWO SCORES- WHICH PROVIDE

01:41:55.509 --> 01:41:58.378
NO INSIGHT TO WEAKNESS OR

01:41:58.445 --> 01:42:00.113
STRENGTH JUST OVERALL MATURITY.

01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:05.652
HOW ARE THEY MORE HELPFUL. SO I

01:42:05.719 --> 01:42:08.388
THINK IT GIVES- THEY WERE

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:11.225
DESIGNED TAKE QUICKLY SEE WHERE

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:14.294
AN ENTITY- IS AS FAR AS THEIR

01:42:14.361 --> 01:42:17.364
MATURITY- ARE THEY PROGRESSING

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:18.765
AND ARE THEY MEETING THOUGH SENT

01:42:18.832 --> 01:42:20.901
MINIMUM STANDARDS SO I THINK-

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:22.336
JUST LIKE WE DISPLAY IN THE

01:42:22.402 --> 01:42:24.304
REPORT THAT ON AVERAGE THE

01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:25.873
MATURITY METRIC SCORES WERE ONE

01:42:25.939 --> 01:42:28.742
POINT THREE WHERE THEY SHOULD BE

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:30.277
AT LEAST A TWO AMP I'M

01:42:30.344 --> 01:42:32.079
POTENTIALLY HIGHER I THINK THOSE

01:42:32.145 --> 01:42:34.414
SUMMARY STATISTICS AND- IF

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:35.282
YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SPECIFIC

01:42:35.349 --> 01:42:37.184
DEPARTMENT THAT'S A EASY NUMBER

01:42:37.251 --> 01:42:38.819
THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT AND CAN GET

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:41.288
A SENSE FOR. HOW ARE WE DOING AS

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:42.689
A STATE HOUSING DEPARTMENT DOING

01:42:42.756 --> 01:42:44.658
AND- DEFINITELY FURTHER

01:42:44.725 --> 01:42:46.860
DISCUSSIONS COULD BE HELPFUL-

01:42:46.927 --> 01:42:48.161
BACK AND FORTH QUESTIONS BUT

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:50.097
THAT'S OF A ONE POINT EASY

01:42:50.163 --> 01:42:51.632
NUMBER THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT THE

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:53.300
TRACK OVER TIME AND COMPARE

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:55.569
ENTITIES TO EACH OTHER. AND WHAT

01:42:55.636 --> 01:43:01.208
ABOUT- GETTING THE FULL I. SA-

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:02.409
TO GET THE WHOLE OF THE WHOLE

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:07.114
STORY. SO I THINK THE I A SAFE

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.016
THAT SINGLE SCORE IS HELPFUL FOR

01:43:09.082 --> 01:43:11.051
COMPARING THAT THE FULL I. SA

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:12.920
WOULD DEFINITELY PROVIDE MORE

01:43:12.986 --> 01:43:15.923
INFORMATION- THAT IF YOU GOT ALL

01:43:15.989 --> 01:43:17.791
OF THE ISAY'S WE LOOKED AT

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:20.394
SCORES FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:22.696
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:23.697
INFORMATION BUT THAT'S SOMETHING

01:43:23.764 --> 01:43:25.432
THAT YOU FOUND HELPFUL. YEAH I

01:43:25.499 --> 01:43:27.301
THINK IT PROVIDES A LOT OF

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:30.170
DETAILED INFORMATION. AND THEN

01:43:30.237 --> 01:43:32.272
THE CSA'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

01:43:32.339 --> 01:43:33.840
NOT REPORTING ENTITIES HAVE

01:43:33.907 --> 01:43:35.309
CHANGED SINCE THE LAST A

01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:38.045
PUBLISHED REPORT CAN YOU TALK

01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:41.214
ABOUT WHY- YOU HAVE SWITCHED

01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:42.983
OVER TO REPORTING TO THE

01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:45.185
LEGISLATIVE. LEADERSHIP AS

01:43:45.252 --> 01:43:49.356
OPPOSED TO REPORTING TO- POLICY

01:43:49.423 --> 01:43:56.163
COMMITTEES WITH THE JURISDICTION. YEAH SO WE HAD IT ADICIONAL

01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:59.333
DISCUSSIONS- A SWEEP I KNOW ONE

01:43:59.399 --> 01:44:00.701
OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS WITH NON

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:02.869
REPORTING ENTITIES ARE

01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:04.738
INDEPENDENCE IS THEIR

01:44:04.805 --> 01:44:09.476
INDEPENDENCE- SO WE FIVE. THAT

01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:11.278
REPORTING AT A HIGHER LEVEL AND

01:44:11.345 --> 01:44:12.079
DEFINITELY THE LEGISLATIVE

01:44:12.145 --> 01:44:14.581
LEADERSHIP COULD REFERRED THAT

01:44:14.648 --> 01:44:17.484
DIRECTLY TO A POLICY COMMITTEE-

01:44:17.551 --> 01:44:19.386
BUT WHEN WE THOUGHT THAT THAT

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:21.588
MIGHT- REPORTING A HIGHER LEVEL

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:23.957
MADE. WOULD MAYBE BE MORE

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:25.559
ACCEPTABLE TURN ON REPORTING

01:44:25.626 --> 01:44:27.728
ENTITIES AND THEN IF THE

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:28.962
LEGISLATURE THINKS IT'S MOST

01:44:29.029 --> 01:44:30.063
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A COMMITTEE

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:31.431
LIKE THIS LOOK AT THAT

01:44:31.498 --> 01:44:33.000
INFORMATION THEN THAT'D BE

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:34.501
DEFINITELY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:35.836
THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY.

01:44:35.902 --> 01:44:36.770
YOU'RE JUST TRYING SOMETHING

01:44:36.837 --> 01:44:38.772
ELSE FIRST THEY DIDN'T LIKE CDT

01:44:38.839 --> 01:44:40.140
AND THEN THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE

01:44:40.207 --> 01:44:41.708
POLICY COMMITTEE SAYS THIS IS

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:44.177
THE THIRD THE THIRD TRY IS THAT

01:44:44.244 --> 01:44:47.481
IT'S- WE NEVER RECOMMENDED

01:44:47.547 --> 01:44:49.616
DIRECTLY TO CDT WE WOULD

01:44:49.683 --> 01:44:50.717
DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:44:50.784 --> 01:44:52.953
LEGISLATURE UNDER WAS THAT SHIFT

01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:54.688
FROM A SPECIFIC COMMITTEE. AND

01:44:54.755 --> 01:44:56.323
IT ANOTHER CONCERN WITH THE

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:59.493
COMMITTEE WAS LAST TIME WE-

01:44:59.559 --> 01:45:02.262
RECOMMEND IT- PRIVACY AND

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:03.730
CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE

01:45:03.797 --> 01:45:05.332
AND I DON'T BELIEVE AT THAT TIME

01:45:05.399 --> 01:45:07.267
THERE IS A QUICKLY SENATE.

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:09.036
COMMITTEE SO THEN THERE IS THE

01:45:09.102 --> 01:45:11.071
CONCERN OF OUR WE ONLY GIVING

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:13.140
INFORMATION TO THE ASSEMBLY SO-

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:15.542
TECH DRESS THAT ALSO GOING AT A

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:16.877
HIGHER LEVEL AND THEN THEY CAN

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:17.978
DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE

01:45:18.045 --> 01:45:19.880
COMMITTEES TO DIG INTO THE

01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:21.248
INFORMATION I KNOW YOU NEVER

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:23.050
RECOMMENDED CD T. BUT IT WAS ON

01:45:23.116 --> 01:45:24.251
IN ONE OF THE EARLIER BILLS

01:45:24.317 --> 01:45:28.021
THERE SO YEAH. YES OKAY WELL

01:45:28.088 --> 01:45:29.823
THAT THAT'S A- MAY SENSE- CSA'S

01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:31.925
RECOMMEND FOR NOT REPORTING

01:45:31.992 --> 01:45:34.227
ENTITIES- CONTINUES TO HAVE A

01:45:34.294 --> 01:45:36.096
THREE YEAR CYCLE FOR ISA'S EVEN

01:45:36.163 --> 01:45:37.698
THOUGH BOTH ARE LOW RISK AND

01:45:37.764 --> 01:45:39.066
HIGH RISK REPORTING ENTITIES

01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:42.035
HAVE A TWO YEAR CYCLE UNDER CD

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:44.771
T. WIDE VARIANCE. SO DID THREE

01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:47.007
YEARS WAS. WAS INTENDED TO BE A

01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:49.142
LITTLE MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:50.877
THAN THE I SAY BECAUSE I SAY IS

01:45:50.944 --> 01:45:52.813
HIGHLY TECHNICAL POINT TIME AND

01:45:52.879 --> 01:45:54.848
WE- WE ENVISION THIS BEING A

01:45:54.915 --> 01:45:56.817
MORE COMPREHENSIVE ALSO LOOK AT

01:45:56.883 --> 01:45:58.251
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND

01:45:58.318 --> 01:46:01.655
BASED ON. A REPORT IN TWENTY

01:46:01.722 --> 01:46:03.924
NINETEEN WE LOOKED AT- THE

01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:06.526
INCREMENTAL OF. THE PEOPLE OF

01:46:06.593 --> 01:46:07.561
THE NUMBER FOR ENTITIES THAT

01:46:07.627 --> 01:46:08.929
WERE DOING THEM HOW FREQUENTLY

01:46:08.995 --> 01:46:10.430
WERE THEY DOING THEM WE LOOK FOR

01:46:10.497 --> 01:46:12.199
GUIDANCE AND BEST PRACTICE AND

01:46:12.265 --> 01:46:13.333
THAT'S HOW WE ENDED ON THE THREE

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.936
YEARS SO- TAKE TO HAVE THAT MORE

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:18.472
COMPREHENSIVE LOOK. IF IT'S

01:46:18.538 --> 01:46:19.906
APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT MORE

01:46:19.973 --> 01:46:21.174
TECHNICAL LOOK EVERY TWO YEARS

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:23.143
IS LIKE HEY I THINK THAT'S

01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:25.378
APPROPRIATE BUT- WE GAVE A

01:46:25.445 --> 01:46:26.446
LITTLE MORE TIME BECAUSE IT'S A

01:46:26.513 --> 01:46:28.215
LITTLE MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN

01:46:28.281 --> 01:46:28.815
JUST THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT

01:46:28.882 --> 01:46:30.917
ASSESSMENT. OKAY SO THE

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:34.721
RECOMMENDATION IS FOR AN AUDIT

01:46:34.788 --> 01:46:35.856
AND I ESSAY EVERY THREE YEARS.

01:46:35.922 --> 01:46:42.829
IT'S. WE SAY AN AUDIT OF

01:46:42.896 --> 01:46:45.365
INFORMATION SECURITY- IN OUR

01:46:45.432 --> 01:46:45.966
TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT WE TALK

01:46:46.032 --> 01:46:47.667
ABOUT COMPREHENSIVE IN IN THAT

01:46:47.734 --> 01:46:49.503
REPORT WE TALK ABOUT ENTITIES

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:51.171
WERE ONLY LOOKING AT PORTIONS OF

01:46:51.238 --> 01:46:53.907
THEIR CONTROLS- IN THE TWENTY

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:54.908
NINETEEN REPORT WE ACTUALLY

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:56.476
VISITED SOME PLACES THAT ONLY

01:46:56.543 --> 01:46:59.679
HAD THE MILITARY ASSESSMENT DONE

01:46:59.746 --> 01:47:01.615
BUT THEY HAVEN'T EVALUATED OTHER

01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:03.717
ASPECTS THAT THE MILITARY

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:05.919
DEPARTMENT HADN'T ADDRESSED SO

01:47:05.986 --> 01:47:07.053
WE RECOMMENDED A MORE

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.655
COMPREHENSIVE AND THAT'S WHAT

01:47:08.722 --> 01:47:12.325
WE'RE GETTING AT HERE- SO.

01:47:12.392 --> 01:47:13.727
OBVIOUSLY THE NON REPORTING

01:47:13.794 --> 01:47:15.295
ENTITIES ARE OUTSIDE THIS OTHER

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:17.130
FRAMEWORKS- SO THEY WOULD HAVE

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:19.232
DISCRETION ABOUT. DO THEY WANNA

01:47:19.299 --> 01:47:19.900
BRING IN THE MILITARY

01:47:19.966 --> 01:47:22.102
ASSESSMENTS AND SUPPLEMENT WITH

01:47:22.169 --> 01:47:24.404
AN AUDIT DO THEY WANT TO HAVE

01:47:24.471 --> 01:47:26.973
ANOTHER ENTITY WE DIDN'T SPECIFY

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.675
THAT KNOWING THE ISSUES WITH

01:47:28.742 --> 01:47:33.013
INDEPENDENCE. OKAY AND THEN-

01:47:33.079 --> 01:47:35.649
FINALLY THE AUDIT DOESN'T SEEM

01:47:35.715 --> 01:47:37.484
TO INDICATE THAT- MILITARY

01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:39.452
DEPARTMENT AS ANY DIFFICULTY AND

01:47:39.519 --> 01:47:40.987

WITH- THIRD PARTIES UNLIKE THE

01:47:49.095 --> 01:47:52.899
DEFAULT FOR REPORTING ENTITIES.

01:47:52.966 --> 01:47:59.806

THIRTEEN AND IN SPITE OF THIS

01:49:56.957 --> 01:50:00.860
REPORT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A

01:50:00.927 --> 01:50:02.395
GOOD- EVEN WITH THIS REPORT I

01:50:02.462 --> 01:50:03.330
DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:05.131
NEGATE. EVERYTHING THAT THEY

01:50:05.198 --> 01:50:07.467

01:50:15.542 --> 01:50:18.745
PICTURE. SO BUT WITH THAT

01:50:18.812 --> 01:50:20.447
