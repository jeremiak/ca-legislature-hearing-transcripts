PLEASE PROCEED I'M SUSAN ENHANCE THE CHIEF DEPUTY OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST COMMISSION AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES AN APARTMENT FINANCE. TO ADDRESS. ARE. STATE HEADQUARTERS OFFICE IN SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE BEEN IN THE LOCATION FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS. OF THE LEASE IS UP IN OCTOBER. AND THE RATES IN SEPTEMBER OF LEASE RATES IN SAN FRANCISCO ARE SOARING. AND IS A VERY DIFFICULT. CIRCUMSTANCE. WE HAVE WORKED OUT WHAT WE THINK IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION WHICH IS TO STAY IN OUR EXISTING LOCATIONS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE. MOVING COSTS. WE ARE. IN A LAST MINUTE KIND OF CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCE WITH THE LANDLORD AND WE DON'T HAVE A LEASE SIGNED YET. SO THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY. THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO MOVE TO ANOTHER LOCATION. AND OTHER LOCATIONS ARE ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT AND WORKING WITH GENERAL SERVICES AND WORKING WITH FINANCE ON THAT. SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AT THIS MOMENT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS SO ARE WE DO SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATION THAT. THAT YOU HAVE AND THINK THAT THAT MAY BE THAT. THE BEST THING TO DO IN AND COME BACK TO YOU. IF. CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE. ALRIGHT OF A THANK YOU. AT ARE THE. OPTIONS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT ARE THEY ALL IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE'VE LOOKED AT MULTIPLE OPTIONS IN SERVICES GO WITH PARTNER GENERAL SERVICES FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT OPTIONS. AND THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT OPTIONS IN OAKLAND. THE THE COMMISSION STATUTE REQUIRES THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OFFICE BE IN A COASTAL COUNTY OAKLAND IS NOT A COSTA COUNTY. BUT IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH TO MATCH THE NEEDS OF BEING NEAR OUR SISTER AGENCY THAT COASTAL CONSERVANCY IN THE BAY CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. WE DO ALL THE. THE. HR THE HUMAN RESOURCES WORK FOR THE BC DC OUR STAFF DOES SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE AS CLOSE TO THEM AS POSSIBLE. ALSO BEING IN A COSTA COUNTY WHERE THERE FOR THE PUBLIC TO GET TO THE LOCATION ONE OF THE OVER ARCHING NEEDS WE HAVE IS TO BE NEAR PUBLIC TRANSIT. WE HAVE A HUNDRED PERCENT COMPLIANCE OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON OUR STAFF USES PUBLIC TRANSIT OR WALKS OR TAKES THEIR BIKE TO WORK EVERYDAY. SO THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ENOUGH UP A TRANSIT CENTER AND ALSO IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO GET. TO. THE COMMISSION LOCATION DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES I'M SEARCHING OUT POSSIBILITIES IN OAKLAND WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A STATUTE ADJUSTMENT TO. BE ABLE TO BE LOCATED IN OAKLAND THEY TOLD ME YESTERDAY THEY DON'T THINK THE PRICES ARE MUCH CHEAPER THERE BECAUSE THE SAME BLOOM IS HAPPENING. IN THAT LOCATION SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS DILIGENT AS AS REPEAT THIS WEEKEND. THANK YOU AYE I THINK A WE. ARE. THE GIVEN THE. SEVERITY THE HOUSING CRISIS WE QUICKLY FORGET THAT. IN SOME AREAS OTHERS SAID. ABOUT A GROWING AFFORDABILITY ISSUES SAW ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE ON THE COMMERCIAL LEASING SIDE SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE FACING SOME OF THAT BUT I. I SUSPECT THAT. HOUSING COSTS ARE ALSO A FACTOR. OF FOR CONTINUING TO BE LOCATED IN IN IN SAN FRANCISCO SINCE THEY ARE. ON A SO HIGH IN THAT AREA AND SURROUNDING AREAS. I THINK MY PREFERENCE ACTUALLY ON THIS ITEM WILL BE TO HOLD IT OPEN SINCE THERE'S SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY. AND TO ASK YOU TO SHARE SOME OF THE. INFORMATION THAT YOU JUST REFERRED TO AND IN GREATER DETAIL WITH. A WITH BUDGET STAFF SO SO THAT TO A WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT IT AS AS AS WELL HAPPY TO DO THAT. THE SUR LA OVER DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENTS GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RYAN BROWN WITH LA NO. WHO WITH REGARD TO THE ORIGINALS BRING SECTION LETTER OF OR EXCUSE ME? FINANCE LETTER WE CAN HAVE ANY CONCERNS WE THE WE GOT QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION FROM THE COMMISSION ABOUT THEIR DUE DILIGENCE THEY DID LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT SITES CAN. THOUGH THIS IS A VERY LARGE INCREASE IN THE RAM WE THOUGHT WAS REASONABLE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT GIVEN THAT CHANGE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW I I THINK HOLDING IT OPEN THAT DOES MAKE SENSE IN THE SHORT TERM. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS FROM DYESS WELCOME MR FONG. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. OUR NEXT ITEM ON THE ITEMS TO BE HEARD IS THE. PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. WHEN WE HEAR FIRST FROM THE. OFF THE RATE PAYER ADVOCATES. AND THEN OUR NEXT ITEM WILL BE. ISSUE NINETEEN THAT WAS PULLED OFF OF THE VOTE ONLY COUNTY. GOOD MORNING MS APPLES WELCOME. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LIMON MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THREE. MY NAME IS ELIZABETH ACKLES DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF RATE PAYER ADVOCATES AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS OR A. THANK YOU FOR IT THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS ORIS REQUEST TO UPDATE. OUR NAME TO PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. AS YOU KNOW ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES IS FOR OVER A TO COMMUNICATE MORE CLEARLY WITH THE PUBLIC AND MAKE OUR PROCESSES MORE TRANSPARENT. AND ACCESSIBLE. AS THE PUBLIC'S ADVOCATE IT IS CRITICAL. TO STRENGTHEN OUR CONNECTION WITH THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. INFORMATION WASTE RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS HELPS US TO FULFILL OUR MISSION BY BUILDING A STRONG CASE TO KEEP UTILITY SERVICES. AS LOW. AS POSSIBLE THE COSTS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. THROUGH OUR INTERACTIONS WITH THE PUBLIC IT IS BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT OUR CURRENT NAME DOES NOT RESONATE WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS. UNFORTUNATELY MANY CUSTOMERS ARE CONFUSED BY THE TERM RATE PAYER. THEY DON'T THINK OF THEMSELVES AS RATE PAYERS THEY PAY BILLS NOT RATES. THE TERM RATE PAYER IS INSIDE BASEBALL ITS TYPICALLY A TERM USED ONLY BY PEOPLE WHO ARE CLOSELY FOLLOW CPC ISSUES. AND OUTSIDE OF THE CPC THAT TERM IS RARELY IS CERTAINLY NOT WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IN FACT OUT OF OVER FORTY ORI EQUIVALENCE AROUND THE COUNTRY ONLY TO STILL USE THE TERM RATE PAYER. MANY OF OUR COUNTERPARTS USE THAT TERM. PUBLIC SUCH AS PUBLIC ADVOCATE OR PUBLIC COUNSEL. CHANGING OUR NAME THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE WOULD MAKE OUR NAY MORE UNDERSTANDABLE TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. AND MORE ACCURATELY CONVEY OUR PUBLIC INTEREST MISSION. THIS STRAIGHTFORWARD NAME CHANGE WILL NOT CHANGE OUR MISSION IT WILL HELP US TO ACHIEVE OUR MISSION. AS THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE SCOPE OF OUR MISSION WILL BE CLEAR. WE ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC IN COMMISSION PROCEEDINGS AND RELATED FORUMS. MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR ABILITY TO INTERACT AND LEARN FROM THE PUBLIC ABOUT THEIR NEEDS AND CHALLENGES WILL BE STRENGTHENED. TOMORROW THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE NUMBER TWO WILL CONSIDER A STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO ADOPT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO RENAME US AS IT PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. THIS CHANGE WILL HAVE NO ASSOCIATED BUDGET COSTS THE LAST TIME OUR NAME WAS CHANGED IT WAS ALSO DONE THROUGH A TRAILER BILL. THE SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT CHANGE WILL UPDATE AND MODERNIZE OUR NAME TO MAKE IT MORE UNDERSTANDABLE THUS HELPING TO STRENGTHEN OUR CONNECTION TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. AS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL. YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO CONNECT WITH YOUR CONSTITUENCY AND THAT WORDS MATTER IN MAKING THAT CONNECTION. BECAUSE THE NAME CHANGE WILL HELP US TO ACHIEVE OUR MISSION IT IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR ME. TO SUM UP. BECAUSE WE ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IS THE SIMPLEST MOST UNDERSTANDABLE NAME FOR OUR OFFICE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTIVELY REQUEST THAT YOU VOTE TO APPROVE CHANGING OUR NAME TO PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE I HOPE THAT WE CAN COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ARE. I OF A VERY MUCH AGREE WITH YOU THAT. THAT THE TERM RATE PAYER IS. NOT ONE THAT'S BROADLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE PUBLIC. MAN CAN LEAD TO SOME CONFUSION. I'M NOT SO SURE THAT PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE REALLY YOU KNOW MAKES IT THAT MUCH CLEAR TO THE PUBLIC. WHAT YOUR ACTUAL MISSION AS? BUT IT CLEARLY DOES TIE INTO PUBLIC AND ADVOCACY AND I THINK THOSE ARE REALLY GOOD POSITIVE. WORDS ARE. BUT I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THAT. WHATEVER THE NAME IS IS THAT IT TABBY CONNECTED TO THAT THE P. YOU SEE. AND SO WHEN YOUR. USING THIS NEW IDENTIFIERS SOMEHOW GOING TO BE LINKED TO CPUC. YEAH I KNOW HOW YES IT IT IS WE WILL WE ARE STILL AND ALWAYS WILL LAUNCH INTO ALWAYS WILL BECAUSE THAT'S IN YOUR HANDS BUT. BUT. FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE RIGHT SO THAT THE OFFICE OF REPAIR ADVOCATES. IS BY STATUTE WITH IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IF THE NAME OR CHANGE WHAT ALSO SIT AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND ARE A CURRENTLY ARE OUR BUSINESS CARDS ARE STATIONARY ON OUR PRESS RELEASES ON EVEN THIS AGENDA ITEM AT ALL IDENTIFIES US AS CONNECTED TO THAT CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SO. SO I THINK BY HAVING THIS OR PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WHAT THAT SCOPE IS THAT WE WOULD BE REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC IN. COMMISSION PROCEEDINGS AND RELATED FORUMS THAT IMPACT UTILITY CUSTOMERS. OKAY. I IT'S A LITTLE BIT WORDY. BUT I'M INCLINED TO THINK THAT PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AS AN OFFICIAL NAME. MIGHT MIGHT. GET US CLOSER BUT I WANT TO GIVE THIS SOME THOUGHT WE ALREADY HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO TO HOLD OPEN. WE WILL RESOLVE THIS BY THE END OF THIS BUDGET CYCLE OF A MAKE THAT COMMITMENT TO YOU. OF BUT I DO THINK THAT CONNECTION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AUTUMN AND I COULD SEE A CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE FUTURE WHERE. ONE MIGHT SHORTEN IT DOWN BUT KEEPING THAT CONNECTIVITY. FOR THE TIME BEING TO ME IS VERY IMPORTANT. AGAIN. AYE I THINK A ONE HAVE ONE MORE CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT I. CAN GET CLOSER TO OF THE PLACE WILL BE ABLE TO PUSH THIS THROUGH. GREAT WELL THANK YOU I I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION AND YOUR EARS THOUGHT THAT IS GOING INTO THAT SAID MEANS A LOT TO ME NAY NAMES ARE IMPORTANT YEAH. THAT EIGHT THEY CONVEY A MESSAGE AND. I WANT TO. HAVE PEOPLE THINK THE WRONG WAY ABOUT THIS BUT YOU KNOW TO TO A DEGREE THIS IS A A A MARKETING ISSUE. ADMIRAL MARKET YOURSELF IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY THAT A FOR PROFIT BUSINESSES DO BUT THE IDENTIFICATION THAT YOU HAVE IS THE WAY THAT THE. THE OF THE MARKETPLACE UNDERSTANDS WHO YOU ARE SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THIS AND THAT YOUR TEAM.

I'M WITH MARINE CORPS INSTALLATIONS WEST TOWARD THE PROPOSAL HERE. IS A TECHNICAL FIX IN THE LAW. RIGHT NOW THE LAW OF. A SEVERELY RESTRICTS MILITARY BASE BEING ABLE TO USE THE ANY IN TWO POINT OH TARIFF THIS IS LIKE A GLITCH IN THE STATUTE THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT. ALL THE PROPOSAL DO IS BRING THIS INTO CONFORMANCE WITH EVERY OTHER CUSTOMER GENERATOR. GRANDEST PARITY WITH UC'S OR. TRIBAL CASINO OR LARGE INDUSTRIAL FACILITY. IN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR THANK YOU I HAVE NO QUESTIONS BUT I THINK. WE MET QUESTION FROM MISTER PATTERSON NON. RIGHT. FONG. I JUST QUESTION I IN TERMS OF UP. WOULD THIS BE WHY DID NOT THAT DID WHY DID THIS PROPOSAL NOT GO THROUGH THE. HIT THE THE COMMITTEE A PROCESS THAT MISTER MISTER PATTERSON CHAIRS. IN TERMS OF WE'RE GOING TO THE BUDGET STEP. POLICY COMMITTEE I JUST DISCUSSIONS WITH THE P. YOU SEE WITH THE BUDGET COMMITTEES. THIS IS WHAT WHAT WAS PROPOSED AYE I CAN ONLY ANSWER MORE THAN THAT. THANK YOU. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM MORE. COMMENT FROM MY ALLEY OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MILLION WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GOOD MORNING CHAIR MORNING. THIS IS THIS PROPOSAL IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THEREFORE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT IT AT THIS TIME. HI. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NONE. WE HAVE A. WE'RE GONNA HOST. ESTABLISH A QUORUM HERE. THE FEDERAL. BLOOM. HERE FONG. KALRA. MULLIN. PATTERSON ALRIGHT WE'RE GONNA. PASS OVER THIS MEASURE FOR THE MOMENT COME BACK TO IT LATER IN THE AGENDA. THAT TAKES US TO CALTRANS. WE HAVE ONE ISSUE THE INDIRECT COST RECOVERY PROGRAM. AND I THAT JUST TO SAY ON THIS ITEM OF THE AGENDA HAS ADOPTING A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE ADOPT. AS ARE ALL BUT WE'RE GOING TO. A HOLE THAT I ITEM OF. AND HOLD IT OPEN. WELCOME. GOOD MORNING GERMAN BLOOM. MONEY WAS RYAN CHAMBERLAIN ON THE NEWLY APPOINTED CHIEF. DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CALTRANS IT'S MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE STEPHEN KHAKI WAS ALSO OUR NEW CFO FOR CALTRANS REPLACING ORTEGA. AND STEVEN WOULD PRESENT. REPORT ON HONOR INDIRECT COST RECOVERY PROGRAM. WELCOME ABOARD SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO THE INDIRECT COST RATE PROPOSAL OR THE ICRP IS ALL REFER TO IT MUCH OF NOW ON. IS THE MEANS BY WHICH A GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INCLUDING CALTRANS NOT JUST CALTRANS BY ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT DEALS WITH BILLING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ASSIGNS INDIRECT COSTS TO INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. INDIRECT COSTS OF THOSE COSTS WHICH CANNOT EASILY BE ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS BECAUSE THERE'S NO CLEAR CONNECTION TO THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECT. IT'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT CONSIDER TO BE OVERHEAD IS THE COMMON PARLANCE IT'S NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PROJECT. BUT THAT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. THE PURPOSE OF ASSIGNING THESE COST TO INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS IS TO THE IS TWO FOLD ONE. IS TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THE TRUE COST OF DOING THE WORK. AND THE SECOND IS TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER THOSE FULL COSTS ON INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS WOMEN WERE BEING REIMBURSED BY OTHERS WHO WERE DOING WORK FOR OTHERS. THE CALTRANS ICRP RATE IS CALCULATED ON TWO DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. AND IT'S CALCULATED BASED ON FEDERAL REGULATIONS ARE ICRP RATE IS APPROVED BOTH BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND BY THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION IN OUR CASE. OTHER GUYS STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES WOULD HAVE THEIR RATE APPROVED BY THEIR APPROPRIATE FEDERAL AGENCY. ARE CALTRANS RATE IS BASED ON TWO SEPARATE COMPONENTS THE FIRST IS THE. FUNCTIONAL OVERHEAD RATE OF THE FUNCTIONAL ICRP RATE. THAT IS. THE LARGER OF THE TWO RATES AND REFLECTS. THE INDIRECT COSTS OF CALTRANS PROJECT DELIVERY PROGRAM. SUCH IS THE COSTS OF TRAINING THE EMPLOYEES PROVIDING SPACE FOR THEM. THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY USE THE MANAGEMENT AND THE SUPERVISION OF THOSE EMPLOYEES. AND THE SECOND PIECE OF THIS ARE OVERHEAD COSTS IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE ICRP RATE. WHICH REFLECT THE COST OF CALTRANS ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS SUCH AS HUMAN RESOURCES. ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTING. BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES THE COSTS OF GOVERNMENT OUTSIDE OF CALTRANS THE CALTRANS ALSO NEEDS TO PAY FOR. THOSE ARE STATEWIDE OF FUNCTIONS SUCH AS STATEWIDE AUDITING OTHER OPERATIONS OF THE TREASURER. AND THE LARGEST PIECE OF THAT IS CALTRAIN SHARE OF. RETIRE I'M SORRY IT WITH THE. HEALTHCARE BENEFITS FOR RETIRED EMPLOYEES USER CHIU COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS IN IT'S A COST TO GO THROUGH THE ICRP WERE ABLE TO ASSIGN TO INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. AND THE RATES ARE APPLIED TO THE PAYROLL. COSTS ON A PROJECT SO WHEN WE CHARGE STAFF TIME TO OTHERS THOSE RATES ARE APPLIED ONLY IN THAT CASE IT'S A PERCENTAGE OF THE STAFF COSTS. THE STATE'S FULL COST RECOVERY POLICY REQUIRES US TO PRINT TO THE CHARGE BOTH OF THESE TWO RATES TO THE PROJECTS GOING TO DO THAT. AND LESS IT'S OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN LAW AND YOUR STAFF A WRITE UP IDENTIFIES THE VERY FEW INSTANCES WHERE THERE IS AN EXCEPTION IN LAW WHO WE DON'T CHARGE EITHER ONE OR BOTH OF THOSE TWO. TWO COMPONENTS. I CRP REIMBURSEMENTS BY THESE ENTITIES THAT ARE DEFRAY SOME OF THE COSTA CALTRANS OF DOING THIS BUSINESS IN PROPORTION TO THE WORK THAT WE PERFORM FOR THEM. THE AMOUNT OF THE REIMBURSEMENTS IS THAT A AYE ONCE A RELATIVELY MINOR BUT IN THE CASE OF SELF HELP COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT. ANNA APPLIES TO MUCH OF THE GREATER. NO CHARGE FOR THE WORK BEING PERFORMED. SO THIS ESSENCE BASICALLY REFLECT THE TRUE COST OF DOING BUSINESS THE TRUE COSTS OF OF OF SUPPORTING EMPLOYEES AT CALTRANS. AND IT'S AGAIN ONLY FOR THE DIRECT LABOR BEING PERFORMED ON THE PROJECT. WE'VE READ THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO. FOR THE ILIO TIME. TO REVIEW THE ICE EUROPEAN DEATH AND WE SUPPORT THAT RECOMMENDATION THIS IS COMPLICATED I PROBABLY MADE IT SOUND VERY EASY IN MY THREE MINUTE PRESENTATION OF QUITE SIMPLE YET RIGHT. BUT IT'S IT IS COMPLICATED AND AND WE WELCOME THE INSIGHTS HELIO CAN BRING TO THIS DISC. I'M GONNA ASK. EFA ANY OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT. WITH THAT TO START. HOW MANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE? LA O. OR HERMAN DEPARTMENT FINANCE COMMENTS PUBLICIST AT THE LA SO WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION EITHER. WE'RE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT IN CAN WORK WITH STAFF ON A. DRAFTING THE REPORTING LANGUAGE IN THE IN THE DEADLINE. RIGHT IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS DEBATE WITH THEIR GRADE ASSOCIATES FOR THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT. WE SHOULD WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES. INTEREST IN REVIEWING THIS ITEM AS THE STAFF ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THERE'S A. LACK OF CONSISTENCY IN HOW ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD IS. BUDGETED FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS. PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO SELF HELP COUNTIES HELP HELP COUNTIES ARE DOING WORK. ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEMS THAT WORK WOULD OTHERWISE BE DONE BY CALTRANS. IF CALTRANS HAD THE MONEY TO BE DOING THAT PROJECT WE VIEW THE SELF HELP COUNTIES AS A STRONG PARTNER. AND WE DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BUILD THE SELF HELP COUNTIES FOR COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT. IF THERE'S COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH CARE RETIREMENT TRAINING CROCS. COST IF ANY OF CALTRANS COST THOSE ARE APPROPRIATE BUT WHEN THERE ARE. OUTSIDE COSTS OF GOVERNMENT WE DON'T THINK THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE PERFORMING THE STATE'S FUNCTION SHOULD BE CHARGED FOR THOSE FUNCTIONS AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO. WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE AND APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND TO RETURN TO IT. LATER AGENDA. I'M SORRY OF COURSE YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST AS SEVEN YOU HAILS FROM A SELF HELP COUNTY. I I'M INCLINED TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE COUNTIES PROPOSAL I HEAR THAT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PROJECT BEING THE SECOND IN THE LINE OF TRENDSETTERS HERE. SO WELL THIS FUNDING REQUEST IS RELATED TO THE SEA WALL LOT IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IN ADDITION TO. HOUSING NEEDS THIS IS. MY TOP FUNDING PRIORITY FOR SAN FRANCISCO AT THIS TIME FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO NOT HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT OURCITY. AND I HOPE THAT IS NONE OF YOU BUT HAPPY TO GIVE YOU ARE TOUR IF THIS IS SOMETHING YOU ARE INTERESTED IN OUR SAN FRANCISCO SEA WALL TEAM MARKET ERA SEA WALL HELPS TO PROTECT. THE SAN FRANCISCO WATERFRONT IT WAS BUILT OVER A CENTURY AGO. AND UNFORTUNATELY TODAY IT IS RAPIDLY DETERIORATING AND IT'S INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE TO EARTHQUAKE AND SEA LEVEL RISE. IT'S A VERY CRITICAL ASSET WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING REGIONAL AND STATE INFRASTRUCTURE IT PROTECTS OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND ASSETS IT'S WHERE MILLIONS LIVE WORK AND PLAY. INCLUDING TWENTY FOUR MILLION VISITORS TO OUR STATE AND OUR CITY EVERY YEAR. THE CITY WILL ALSO PROTECTS CRITICAL UTILITY JUST DUMP NETWORKS AS WELL AS REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE BAY. OF I'VE A BILL THAT BUILDS ON A LAW THAT WAS PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE SOME THIRTEEN YEARS AGO THAT ALLOW FOR THE FORMATION OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT. ALONG RC WALL TO FUND IMPROVEMENTS TO AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND HISTORIC RESOURCES OF THE BILL WOULD REVISE OUR IT LAW TO INCLUDE THE SHORELINE PROTECTION THAT WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR SEE WHAT. AT THIS TIME IT'S ESTIMATED TO REBUILD OUR SEA WALL IT'LL COST US BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AT THE LATEST PRICE TAG IS ABOUT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IT'S GONNA REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT FROM LOCAL SOURCES FEDERAL SOURCES PRIVATE SOURCES AND WE HOPE FROM THE STATE THE ACID I HAVE IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE IS FOR A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. INVESTMENT. THAT COMPARES TO FOR EXAMPLE A LOCAL BALLOT MEASURE THAT'S GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO VOTERS FOR MANY TIMES AT THIS COMING FALL. A AND WITH THAT I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT YOU COULD HELP IN THIS INVESTMENT. THAT WILL NOT REALLY PROTECT NOT JUST A CITY ASSET BUT STATE AND REGIONAL ASSN.

ANYWAY LET ME START OFF BY SAYING ARE GOOD MORNING TO EVERYONE AND I WOULD LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY ASK THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR. A REQUEST FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS I REDUCTION FUND FOR WATER SUPPLY AND WASTE WATERS SYSTEM PROJECTS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF CALIFORNIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DELIVERING WATER WAS INSTALLED AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR WHICH WAS MORE THAN SEVEN DECADES AGO. AS YOU KNOW WATER IS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCES AND WITHOUT FUNDING TO REPLACE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BIPLANES. AND OTHER IMPORTANT FACILITIES TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF WATER CAN BE LOST. THIS IS DEAR WATER THAT WE SOMETIMES JUST CAN'T KEEP UP WITH PROVIDING ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STATEWIDE ISSUE BUT ONE THAT PARTICULARLY IMPACTS RURAL AREAS AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. REPLACING OLD WATER INFRASTRUCTURE USING DOLLARS FROM THE G. G. R. F.. FUND WILL SHOW THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN WATER USE AND SUPPLY. IN ADDITION TO KEEPING IN LINE WITH CALIFORNIA'S CARBON REDUCTION GOALS. THAT'S MY FIRST REQUEST OUT TO THE COMMITTEE MY SECOND REQUEST SECONDLY I'D LIKE TO ASK THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDS. FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA WOULD INNOVATION SMALL GRANT PROGRAM. IN ADDITION. I'D LIKE TO REQUEST A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR ON GOING FUND FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP IMPROVE OUR HEALTHY FORESTS. WE'RE DEALING WITH A SEVERE TREE MORTALITY CRISIS AND MUST ADDRESS SOLUTIONS FOR THE MORE THAN HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD OR DYING TREES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND I DO MEAN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WELL WE'VE SEEN THE DEAD AND DYING TREES FROM KERN COUNTY ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH THE BEGINNINGS OF CALAVERAS COUNTY. WE'RE NOW SEEING IT EXTENDING ALL THE WAY UP INTO EL DORADO COUNTY AND FARTHER SO THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO GROW RAPIDLY EXPONENTIALLY. USING A GT R. F. FUNDS TO ESTABLISH THE SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM WOULD INCENTIVIZE ORGANIZATIONS AND BUSINESSES TO DEVELOP WOOD PRODUCTS WITH THE ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF REMOVING DANGEROUS TREES. AND THE EXCESS BIOMASS THAT AS WE KNOW ARE CREATING TREMENDOUS FIRES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

SIA'S LANDS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE THE SIX COUNTIES ARE CURRENT LOS ANGELES MARINE ORANGE SANTA BARBARA BEEN TRAPPED I REPRESENT PARTS OF TO THESE CONTRACT COUNTIES. SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA AS YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW EACH OF THE SIX CONTRACT COUNTIES EXPERIENCE WILDFIRES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITHIN TRANSCEND BARBARA COUNTIES. FIGHTING THE LARGEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY HENCE MY REASON FOR BEING HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THESE FIRE AGENCIES. THE SIX COUNTIES WERE PREVIOUSLY IN AGREEMENT WITH CAL FIRE TO RECEIVE CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING BASED ON A PRE AGREED FORMULA WHICH ENTITLED THE SIX COUNTIES TO AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO. NINETEEN PERCENT OF CAL FIRE SIX COUNTIES RECEIVED THIS NINETY PERCENT FUNDING FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THROUGH TWENTY TWELVE. ACCORDING TO VENTURA COUNTY FIRE CHIEF MARK LORENZEN IN TWENTY TWELVE CAL FIRE PREFER INFORMS THE CONTRACT COUNTIES THAT IT COULD NO LONGER PROVIDE CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING BECAUSE THIS FUNDING WAS NOW BEING FUNDED FROM LEASE REVENUE BONDS. AND REQUIRED THE STATE PROPERTIES TO BE USED AS COLLATERAL WHICH PREEMPTED ELIGIBILITY FOR THE COUNTIES EVER SINCE TWENTY TWELVE THE SIX COUNTIES HAVE BEEN PURSUING CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING IN THE REGULAR BUDGETPROCESS USING THE AGREED UPON NINETEEN PERCENT FORMULA. IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE CAPITAL OUTLAY APPROPRIATION FOR CONTRACT COUNTIES AND IT WAS INCLUDED IN THE FINAL BUDGET SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. LAST YEAR'S THE COUNTIES WAITED WAITED OUT THE PROCESS AND DID NOT PARTICIPATE BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FEDERAL BUDGET IMPACT ON THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET.

TENNIS COURTS WERE ADDED IN THE SEVENTIES. RENOVATIONS TO THE EXISTING FACILITIES HAVE OCCURRED IN A PIECEMEAL FASHION OVER THE YEARS AS FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE. SO THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A COMPLETE RENOVATION. FOR EXAMPLE WE SURFACING OF THE BASKETBALL INTENDED BECAUSE COURTS COULDN'T HAVE NOT OCCURRED IN OVER TEN YEARS WITH FENCING AROUND THE BASEBALL FIELD. OVER THIRTY YEARS OLD. WASHINGTON PARK IS EXTENSIVELY USED BY THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS A VITAL RESOURCE TO THE COMMUTE COMMUNITY BUT A SEVERELY ON THE FUNDING. IN TERMS OF MAINTENANCE AND RENOVATION. LOCATED IN THE OLD URBAN CORE OF THE CITY OF ESCONDIDO WASHINGTON PARK IS A CENTRAL POINT. IN A MINORITY LOW INCOME UNDERSERVED AREA OF THE CITY SURROUNDED BY DENSE MULTI FAMILY AND RENTAL HOUSING. SERVING AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF OVER FORTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE. CENSUS TRACTS SURROUNDING THE PARK AMONGST THE LOWEST IN THE NATION WITH AVERAGE LOW INCOME INCOMES. FOR FAMILIES OF FOR A THIRTY THREE THOUSAND UNLESS. WITH A NINETY ONE PERCENT MINORITY POPULATION.

THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY HAS A PLAN TO PURCHASE THE FALL BOOK PUBLIC UTILITY OF IT DISTRICT PROPERTY SO LONG AS THE REQUESTED FUNDING IS PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY EIGHT ON THE JUNE FIFTH THE BALLOT.

RIVER PROPERTY AND WOULD BE OPEN AND FREE TO THE PUBLIC IN PERPETUITY SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOLLY. COULD BREAK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT I WANT TO JUST I'M NOT ASKING FOR TECHNICAL FIX ON A TRANSPORTATION. ITEM THE ME EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. THE GVW VEHICLES HAS BEEN WHAT IT IS AND EIGHT THE SAFETY OF THESE VEHICLES HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE TIME SO. YOU HAD GAS ENGINES WITHOUT BINGEING BREAKS WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY LIGHT BREAKS AND SO BASICALLY THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLES AS INCREASE BUT ALSO AT THE GVW THOSE VEHICLES. HAS INCREASED AS WELL. AND WHAT HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THERE WAS A. OF THAT LEGISLATION THE CAPE THROUGH THAT CAPTURED THESE VEHICLES BECAUSE OF WEIGHT AND SO I'M SIMPLY TRYING TO. MAKE IT MAKES SOME SENSE AND I'M TRYING TO. A NARROWLY CRAFTED THERE'S NO THERE'S NO REVENUE LOST BUT IT WILL ALLOW SO THAT WE GIVE EXAMPLE IF YOU OWN A LANDSCAPING. BUSINESS AND YOU HAVE A BOX ON THE BACK YOUR TRUCK YOUR CAPTURED IN THIS BI ANNUAL INSPECTION. THIS BILL FOR THIS THIS MEASURE WOULD ALLOW YOU TO AB. NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT INSPECTION AND IT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW ALSO THAT DEBT PUBLIC AGENCIES DON'T. HAVE TO DO THIS SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T DO IT IF THEY HAVE THAT X. SAME STYLE OF TALL READ YOU WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO DO BUT I WANTED IT TO US SET THAT UP SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I'M TRYING TO ALLOW SMALL LANDSCAPING FOLKS NOT HAVE TO GET CAPTURED IN THIS. IN THIS NEW REGULATION THE EXEMPTION HAS A GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT RATING OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND AND LIMITS PICK UP OR TOW VEHICLES FROM EXCEEDING A GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT OF SIXTEEN THOUSAND ONE POUNDS. THE LANGUAGE ALSO ENSURES COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW BY INCLUDING ONLY THOSE VEHICLES THAT OPERATE IN INTERSTATE. INTERSTATE COMMERCE VEHICLES THAT OPERATE IN ENTRUST STATE CONGRESS. ARE SUBJECT TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION'S ARE EXCLUDED. THE SAFETY OF VEHICLES INCLUDE UNDER THE EXEMPTION WILL NOT BE LEFT UNCHECKED BASED ON THEIR WEIGHT AND CONFIGURATION. THESE VEHICLES AND VEHICLE COMBINATIONS ARE LIKELY TO STILL REQUIRE A MOTOR CARRIER PERMIT ISSUED BY DMV. TRAVEL THROUGH ROADWAYS INSPECTION STATIONS MANNED BY CHP AT HERE TO FEDERAL. DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION REGULATIONS FOR THOSE TRAVELING. INTERSTATE PAY WAIT PEAS AT HERE TO THE HOURS OF SERVICE AND LOG BOOK REQUIREMENTS JUST TO NAME A FEW. AN EXEMPTION IS ENFORCEABLE RELATIVELY TO GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT MANUFACTURES POST THE WEIGHT OF THE PICK UPS AND TRAILERS ON THE DOOR JAM OR THE NECK OF THE TRAILER. SIMPLY SIMPLE ARITHMETIC CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THE PICK UP EXCEED SIXTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS OR A COMBINATION TWENTY SIX. NOW THAT'S A LOT SAID BUT BASICALLY WHAT. IF YOU'RE GONNA BE OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND VALUE WILL BE REGULATE IF YOU'RE IN A COMBINATION IF YOU'RE UNDER THAT YOU WILL NOT. AND IT WILL SIMPLY BRING FOLKS THAT ARE AT LANDSCAPING AND SMALL OPERATIONS IT AT. A INTO COMPLIANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WHO WANT TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. ON THIS REQUEST. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. WE WILL HEAR FROM MADNESS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. OF AND I'LL JUST A RUN THROUGH THE LIST NOW SEE ALL KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN THE QUEUE.

IN MULTIMILLION DOLLAR IMPACT OF THE INVASIVE SHOT HOLE BORE BEETLE ON CALIFORNIA'S TREES. THAT'S FAR THERE'S NOT BEEN A COORDINATED STATEWIDE EFFORT TO COMBAT THE SPREAD OF THESE BEETLES WHICH IF LEFT UNCHECKED WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOSS OF EVEN MORE TREES INCREASING FIRE HAZARDS PUBLIC SAFETY RISKS. AN INNOCENT DIEGO COUNTY AT THE LAS OF AVOCADO TREES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THAT I ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER APPROPRIATING TURNER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR COORDINATION BETWEEN INVASIVE SPECIES COUNCIL CALIFORNIA THE COUPLE INVASIVE SPECIES ADVISORY COMMITTEE. STATE LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR THE SUPPRESSION A CURE OF DISEASE. ASSOCIATED WITH A SHOT HOLE WAR.

WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS. ARE ABLE TO FIX ISSUES OF CONTAMINATION THERE FOUND AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR CHILDREN ACROSS CALIFORNIA. CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE PROGRAM ONLY FUND PROJECTS AT FIVE HUNDRED SCHOOLS. WE HAVE TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS IN THE STATE SO THAT BE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE IF I IF AS WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW SCHOOLS BEGIN TO IDENTIFY CONTAMINANTS IN THE WATER LAST YEAR WE PASSED A BILL REQUIRING SCHOOLS TO TEST OUR WATER FOR LEAD. AND I'M AS THEY HAVE FOUND TOO MANY POSITIVE TEST FOR LEAD OTHER DOES HAVE TO BE REPLACEMENT OF OF THAT NUMBER THINGS IN SCHOOLS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON SOME OF THESE PROJECTS. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY SUPPORT TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAKE ANY CORRECTIVE ACTIONS NEEDED TO REMOVE HARMFUL CONTAMINANTS FROM WATER ONCE OUR COUNT. THAT'S ALL I GOT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I THINK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY. URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND FOR CLARIFICATION SAKE THAT'S THE SHOT HOLE BORER NOT THE SHOT FULL BORE FOR FETAL IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING ELSE BUT I COULDN'T PRONOUNCE POLY. SAVILE BLASTS IN KARAJ AYE YEAH I HAVE AYE AYE. I I THINK MY STAFF FOR THE VERY AMBITIOUS TALKING POINTS BUT IT'S A BEETLE. THAT'S IT THE BEETLE IT'S VERY INVASIVE BEETLE IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE LIGHT OF IT. BUT WE DO TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT BORING SOMETIMES. GONNA MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. PUBLIC COMMENT AND EITHER OF THESE ITEMS PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MARK FRIENDSTER MAKER FOR THE CALIFORNIA URBAN FOREST COUNCIL IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT OF THE FIRST ITEM REGARDING THE SHOT HOPE OR WORDS. GOOD AFTERNOON LEN ARCHIE'S ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA INVASIVE PLANT COUNCIL IN BOTH THE CHICA LAND TRUST AGAIN IN SUPPORT OF THE FIRST ASKING COMBATING CHUCKLE BORDERS THINK YOU. GOOD MORNING TASHA NEWMAN AYE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE BIG SUR LAND TRUST AND THE CINEMA AG AN OPEN SPACE DISTRICT. IN SUPPORT OF THOSE SHOT HOLE BORDER. REQUEST. BOB BRYAN AGAINST ON BEHALF OF A NUMBER OF GROUPS IN SUPPORT OF THE SECOND REQUEST ON SAFE DRINKING WATER IN SCHOOLS INCLUDING. RURAL COMMUNITIES SYSTEMS CORPORATION SELF HELP ENTERPRISES. CRLA FOUNDATION LEADERSHIP COUNCIL. THREE WATER CENTER. CALIFORNIA GOOD POLICY ADVOCATES AND POLICY LINK. MORNINGSTAR MILLS A CALIFORNIA RELIEF HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE FIRST ITEM ON SHUTTLE BORE. ONE OF THEM WE DON'T KNOW WITHOUT BY CALIFORNIA HEARING SUPPORT FIRST ITEM. TO BE INVASIVE BEETLE. I THINK. GOOD MORNING LUCAS FACTS ABOUT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT OF A SHOT HOLE BORE A QUEST AS WELL. THE INVASIVE BEETLE HAPPEN IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE I THINK I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. DOCTOR MONDO VALERIO PRIVATE CITIZENS SUPPORT OF THE SECOND ITEM. MAY I WITH THE BEATLE INVASION SORRY. GEN NINE WITH YOUR CHILDREN'S TREES IN GO LEADER IN SUPPORT OF THE. AND BASS PUNCH MODEL POOR ITEM. ROSE UP PERSON FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF ARBOR CULTURE. IN SUPPORT OF ITEM ONE SHUTTLE BART. THANK YOU FOR ALL THOSE COMMENTS AND THAT WILL MOVE ON TO MISS FRAZIER. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR CONSIDERATION TO ALLOCATE NINETY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT IN VA FOR AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED NEW CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS. THIS WILL RESTRICT OR THE DEPARTMENT TO IS TRADITIONAL STAFFING WELL LEVEL AND HELP ADDRESS THE RISING TOLL OF TRAFFIC DEATHS ON THE STATE HIGHWAYS. SIMPLE FACT STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS REQUEST FOR EXAMPLE SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN. THE STATE'S POPULATION HAS INCREASED EIGHT POINT FOUR PERCENT. REGISTERED VEHICLES HAVE INCREASED ELEVEN POINT SIX PERCENT. LICENSED DRIVERS HAVE INCREASED ELEVEN POINT THREE PERCENT. MEANWHILE CRASHES HAVE INCREASED TWENTY NINE PERCENT. THE MILEAGE DEATH RATE HAS INCREASED TO TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT. CHP PERSONNEL HAS DECREASED FIVE PERCENT. FROM SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT. TWO SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE. IN OTHER WORDS CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION NUMBER OF REGISTERED VEHICLES UNLICENSED DRIVER CONTINUE TO INCREASE WHILE THE HIGHWAY PATROL OFFERS HAVE. HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS HAVE BECOME MORE SCARCE. THE RESULTS OF THESE DIVERGENT TRENDS ARE CLEAR. MORE ACCIDENTS AND INCREASED RETAIL FATALITY RATE. RESOLVING THIS TRAGIC TREND IS VERY SIMPLE. THE PRESENCE OF OUR OFFICERS ON OUR HIGHWAYS DETERS UNSAFE DRIVING BEHAVIORS. FOR TOO LONG IS BEEN TOO EASY FOR RECKLESS DRIVERS TO SPEED. AND DRIVE WHILE IMPAIRED OR DISTRACTED OR MAKE OTHER UNSAFE CHOICES. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS NINETY SIX THOUSAND TICKETS WERE GIVEN OUT FOR DISTRACTED DRIVING ALONE LAST YEAR. WHERE THESE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN DISTRACTED THEMSELVES WERE TRYING TO ENFORCE? THAT TEN DOLLAR. PENALTY. STUDIES SHOW THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF ENFORCEMENT DRIVERS ARE LIKE LESS LIKELY TO AND FOLLOW THE LAW OF THE LAND AND MAINTAIN SAFE TRAVELING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF US. I BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE BEGIN TO BRING OUR HIGHWAY PATROL BACK INTO ALIGNMENT WITH OUR GROWTH. A GROWING POPULATION. FOR REFERENCE OF THE NUMBER OF HIGHWAY PATROL PERSONAL INCREASED THE EIGHT POINT FOUR PERCENT CENSUS TWO THOUSAND LEVEL. TO KEEP UP WITH THE STATE'S POPULATION GROWTH. WE WE SHOULD HAVE EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED OFFICERS PATROLLING OUR STATE. THAT WOULD BEING AN INCREASE OF ROUGHLY ONE THOUSAND OFFICERS MORE THAN THE STATE CURRENTLY EMPLOYEES. AGAIN I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO MAKE THIS SAFETY EFFORT A PRIORITY IN OUR STATE BUDGET. I KNOW THEY EARN READ WAS FORCED TO JOIN ME TO THE SET THE SET THIS MORNING BROUGHT HIGH. I GOT NUMBER TWO YOU BAKER IS HERE WITH THEIR READS OFFICE TO. SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DEBATE WITH THEIR GREATNESS AS HIS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HIGHWAY PATROLMAN IN SUPPORT APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND. WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM THE CROWD AND I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE ASK I I'M I'M. BUT TO SUPPORT IT AND WANT TO MAKE THAT NOTED I THINK IT'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT ASK FOR THE REASONS OF THE. OTHER MEMBERS APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT TO US THANK YOU I JUST KNOW THAT IF I IF I MISTER CHAIR. WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS KILLED IN AND THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THERE WAS AN OFF DUTY HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS THAT KEPT MY SECOND ON ALIVE. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SAFETY TO OUR RESIDENTS WITHOUT IT RESPECT ESCRIBIR. THANK YOU. AND MS AGUIAR-CURRY. YOU'RE UP NEXT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. I KNOW YOU ARE ALL WELL WELL AWARE OF THE WILDFIRES IN MY DISTRICT AND MISTER WOODS MISLI MOANS THIS PAST YEAR SO I WILL NOT TAKE YOUR TIME RECAPPING THE DEVASTATION AND LOSS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND PEOPLE AND SEVERAL OTHERS AREAS OF THE STATE. I'M APPEARING BEFORE YOU TO ASK FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL. TO MODERNIZE AND STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA'S MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. INCLUDING LOCAL AGENCY REIMBURSEMENTS THROUGH OH YES FOR PRE POSITIONING. OUR SYSTEM IS A NATIONAL MODEL MODEL BUT IS DESIGNED AS REACTIVE THIS ARGUMENTATION WILL ADDRESS. THESE ISSUES IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY AND HELP TO TURN OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM INTO A PROACTIVE SYSTEM. THE FUNDS WOULD BE SPENT AS FOLLOWS. EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COSTS FOR PRE POSITIONING RESOURCES IN HIGH RISK AREAS DURING PERIODS OF RED FLAG FIRE CONDITIONS. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL STRIKE TEAMS TO PREVENT FIRES FROM BECOMING CATASTROPHIC. MOBILIZING THE STRIKE TEAMS BECAUSE BROUGH MOBILIZING THE STRIKE TEAMS COST GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY. THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO PAY FOR IMPROVE COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES TO ALLOW MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE RESOURCE DEPLOYMENT. THIS FUNDING WOULD PROVIDE FOR THEM RETROFIT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT EQUIPMENT TO MIR SAFETY TECHNOLOGY THAT IS ALREADY BEING DEPLOYED IN STATE OWNED EQUIPMENT. IS THE NEW THIS IS A NEW STATE OF THE ART SYSTEM FOR REQUESTING AND MANAGING RESOURCES FOR LARGE SCALE EMERGENCIES. ADDITIONAL OH YES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL TO STAFF REGIONAL DISPATCH CENTERS AND IMPROVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR ALERTING INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES OF APPROACHING THREATS. LEADER SO CALIFORNIA FIRE SERVICE TELL US THAT THE STRATEGIES AND RESOURCES WE ARE ASKING FOR TODAY CAN HELP PREVENT THESE FIRES FROM BECOMING MEGA FIRES. AND MAY HAVE MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. PLEASE SUPPORT OUR FIREFIGHTERS PLEASE FOR YEARS SUPPORT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND FUND THE STRATEGIES THAT ARE FIRE CHIEF SOME FIREFIGHTERS ARE REQUESTING.

IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE HAS THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS THE F. DESPITE THE TOLL MIGHT HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH HIGHER. THIS HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FIRE PROTECTION FUNDING. IN HOPE WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS IN HOPES THAT WHEN THE NEXT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE HITS OUR FIRST RESPONDERS WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED THAT SO THAT WHAT WE'RE BETTER PREPARED BETTER PROTECTED. AND THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. A SINCE COMING TO THIS LEGISLATURE I'VE BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT IN OUR WILD LANDS IN THIS YEAR HAVE YET ANOTHER BILL AIMED AT INVESTING MORE RESOURCES IN CHANGING HOW WE MANAGE OUR WILD LANDS. BUT THAT'S THE LONG GAME WE DUG OURSELVES TO BIG HOLD THE FOCUS ON RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FIRE PREVENTION ALONE. PAST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES CLIMATE CHANGE DROUGHT AN INFESTATION OUR BORDERS AND BEATLES. THOMAS WHO HAVE CREATED A LANDSCAPE THAT ALL BUT GUARANTEES MORE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES TWELVE OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS. THESE UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES DEMAND THAT WE INVEST IN ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE RESPONSE RESOURCES AS WELL OF INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES TO PREVENT PREAMP AND MITIGATE DISASTERS WHENEVER POSSIBLE. LEADERSHIP CALIFORNIA'S FIRE SERVICE TELL US THAT THE STRATEGIES AND RESOURCES WE'RE ASKING FOR TODAY CAN HELP PREVENT THESE FIRES BECOME FROM BECOMING THE MEGA FIRES AT MISS AGUILAR CURRY SPOKE ABOUT. AND IT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR DISTRICT LAST OCTOBER EIGHTH.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO. THE DISTRICT I SERVE. SANTA ANA REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION CENTER WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. SINCE THAT TIME THE CITY OF SANTA ANA HAS ADOPTED THE TRANSIT ZONING CODE IN A STATION DISTRICT MASTER PLAN WHICH HAS SPURRED DEVELOPMENT IN THE ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS PARTICULAR TRAIN STATION IS A VITAL REGIONAL INTERMODAL TRANSIT HUB. BRINGING TOGETHER AMTRAK METROLINK ORANGE COUNTY TRANSIT AUTHORITY BUS SERVICES AND TAXI SERVICES IN ONE LOCATION. IT IS THE COUNTY SEAT OF ORANGE COUNTY. AN ESTIMATED THREE THOUSAND COMMUTERS PASSED THROUGH THE CENTER EVERY DAY A NUMBER WHICH IS EXPECTED TO RISE.

I'M JOINED TODAY BY CASEY ELLIOTT WHO REPRESENTS THE CITY OF SANTA ANA. Q. SEALY IT ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN AND I WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET REQUEST THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUDGET IS VERY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE. MS CABALLERO THANKS AGAIN THANK YOU SIR. YEAH BUT. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER I THINK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT ON THIS BUDGET. REQUEST A CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS SHARE A GREAT AGRICULTURAL HISTORY WE FEED THE NATION AND THE PLANET WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED SPECIALTY CROPS THAT CAN ONLY BE GROWN IN OUR UNIQUE CLIMATE. THESE BUDGET REQUEST WILL ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA FARMERS RANCHERS DAIRY MEN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO THRIVE WITH THE SAFE SUSTAINABLE HIGH PRODUCING AN ECONOMICALLY VALUABLE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. BY INVESTING AGRICULTURE CAT CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE NATION AND THE WORLD IN AG TECHNOLOGY START UPS VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING AND OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES WILL SEE NEW TECH JOBS KEEPING INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. IN RURAL COMMUNITIES SUFFER FROM A BRAIN DRAIN AT ITS BEST AND BRIGHT BRIGHTEST URBAN JOB CENTERS. FIRST WE MUST ACT QUICKLY TO ADEQUATELY FUND PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THE ECONOMIC SAFETY OF A HUGE INDUSTRY. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE CROPS DECIMATED BY AM INVASIVE PESTS LIKE FLORIDA DID. I ASKED FOR A BUDGET ITEM OF FORTY FIVE MILLION TWO CD A PHASE INVASIVE PLANT AND PEST MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS IN OTHER WORDS THAT WOULD. INCLUDE THE BAR OR. AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTES TARIFFS CONSTRICTING OUR EXPORT MARKETS I SEEK FUNDS OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO THE CALIFORNIA GROWN MARKETING AGREEMENT. CHORUS RELY ON OUR LAND GRANT INSTITUTIONS FOR APPLIED RESEARCH AND ADVISORY SERVICES. A BUDGET OF TEN MILLION ANNUALLY TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES DIVISION TO HIRE AND RETAIN COOPERATIVE EXTENSION EXPERT ADVISORS WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA'S INSTITUTIONS TO COMPETE IN THIS. BASICALLY WOULD RESTORE THESE. THESE ACT. EXPERTS THAT HAVE BEEN. REDUCED OVER THE YEARS. SMALL FARMERS MISSPENT HOURS EVERY MONTH AWAY FROM THEIR BUSINESS TO IT NAVIGATE THE LABYRINTH OF DIFFERENT STATE AGENCY WEBSITE IN ORDER TO FILL OUT FORMS. AB THIS REQUEST SIX ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO CDFA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CENTRALIZED AG BUSINESS PORTAL. WERE ALL REPORTING AND REGULATORY INFORMATION FROM ANY STATE AGENCY WILL LIVE IN ONE ONLINE LOCATION. AND BECAUSE IT ADVANCED IMPLANT ECONOMIC MODEL OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY INDICATES THAT THE TOTAL IMPACT IS UP TO SIX HUNDRED BILLION ANNUALLY OF THE TWO POINT SIX TRILLION GDP. ON THIS REQUEST SEEKS TO PROVIDE FUNDS TO THE M. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO PRODUCE THEIR OWN IMPLANT. FARM TO FORK ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS. SECOND WE MUST INVEST TO CREATE A STATEWIDE CALIFORNIA AG TECH INNOVATION PLATFORM. AG TECH IS A YOUNG INDUSTRY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WEALTH CREATION IN RURAL AREAS THROUGH AG TECH ISRAEL IF CALIFORNIA CAPTURES VENTURE VENTURE CAPITAL DOLLARS AND IS HOME TO ACT TECH INNOVATORS AND START UP COMPANIES. MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WORLD IN AG TECH INVESTING IN ENTREPRENEURS THIS REQUEST IS FOR TWENTY MILLION TWO CD OF PAY. TO DEVELOP THE AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION INSTITUTE ON THIS WOULD BE ONE OF SIX AND TO INSTITUTES THAT ARE ALREADY LOCATED AT THE UC. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE NATURAL RESOURCES DIVISION. PERHAPS JUST AS IMPORTANTLY I REQUEST THAT FUTURE BUDGETS INCLUDE AN INCENTIVE TAX CREDIT TO ADOPT ADOPTERS OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY WHEN DEPLOYED ON IRRIGATED ACRES WITH THE GOAL TO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES AND ENERGY. WATER FERTILIZER PESTICIDE USE OR TO AUTOMATIC PLANTING THINNING HARVESTING AND PRODUCTION SERVICES. THIS ACT TECH CREDIT MODEL FOCUSES OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE CREDITS TO FARMERS UNDER A THOUSAND ACRES WHICH IS ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE HARVESTED ACREAGE. AND MAY HAVE A HARDER TIME OVERCOMING THE OPERATIONAL CAPITAL COST TO ADAPT ACT TECHNOLOGY WERE BASICALLY ASKING FARMERS TO PRODUCE MORE WITH LESS AND THIS GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO THAT TECHNOLOGY AND AND AND ACTUALLY UP AND BRING IT UP TO SCALE. THIRD BY EDUCATING CALIFORNIA'S RURAL YOUTH SO THEY CAN MANAGE IT OPERATE OUR FARMS OF THE FUTURE WE PROVIDE THE ROOT FOR RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO FILL THESE NEW ACTING CHOPS. SMART FARMS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE WILL BE ACT TECH SHOWCASES WERE SMALL GROUPS WITH THE HOW TO JUMP THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. AND STUDENTS WILL FIND REAL WORLD CAREER PATH PATHWAYS. AG TECH WORK COURSEWORK WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED MORE DEEPLY IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM SYSTEM AND. DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE. JOBS ON THE FARM WILL CHANGE AS PRECISION AND AUTOMATED AG EXPANDS. THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA FARM WORKER IT'S OVER FIFTY FIVE AND THE LABOR POOL IS SHRINKING. THERE WILL BE FEWER AND FEWER JOBS IN THE FIELD HIGHER PAYING JOBS REQUIRING THE ABILITY TO MANAGE AND INTEGRATE WITH TECHNOLOGY AND THAT MEANS RURAL KIDS WILL NOT HAVE TO MOVE TO THE SILICON VALLEY TO WORK IN TECH. I'M I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR FARMS ALL OVER THE STATE AND IT'S INCREDIBLE THE AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BEING UTILIZED AND WE REALLY NEED TO TRAIN THE WORKFORCE. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T THESE JOBS WILL BE TAKEN BY OTHER. STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE REALLY AGGRESSIVE TECH. AB STRATEGIES TO BE ABLE TO COME IN AND AND DEPLOY ON AND AND ACTUALLY WORK THE SYSTEM. I AM ASKING FOR SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN STATE AGENCY THAT PROVIDES CRITICAL ADVISORY SERVICES AND REGULATORY PROTECTION FOR STEMS THE INVESTMENT WILL YIELD GREAT RETURNS FOR THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND RURAL COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR. AND MARRIES TO OF CALIFORNIA'S STRONGEST INDUSTRIES WITHOUT TAKING BOLD STEPS THE INDUSTRY WILL LACK THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE TO MEET THE MASSIVE MODERNIZATION CHALLENGES WHICH ARE BEING DRIVEN. BY THE STATE'S REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT BY FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AND TRADE POLICIES AND BY OUR OWN NEED TO FEED A HUNGRY WORLD. THANK YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT INCLUDING THESE REQUESTS IN THE BUDGET.

ORGANIC WASTE LANDFILLS APPROX IT REDUCES APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MILLION TONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES EVERY YEAR. CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROPERLY HANDLE OTHER ORGANIC WASTE WE GENERATE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT WE NEED BETWEEN FIFTY AND A HUNDRED LARGE SCALE FACILITIES WILL BE NEEDED TO MEET THE GOALS. THAT WE SET OUT IN S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT. INVESTMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPOSTING FACILITIES ANAEROBIC DIGESTION HERBS. AND OTHER RECYCLING OUTLETS TO PROCESS THIS WASTE. THIS IS A BIPARTISAN BUDGET REQUEST ASKING FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GO TO COUNT RECYCLE FROM G. GRF FUNDS.

I THINK MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. THE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU ON A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE OF DAM SAFETY. BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT. AND THAT I THINK I SHOULD REALLY CONCERN ALL OF US IS THE CHANCE OF A DEVASTATING FLOOD AND A LEVEE BREAK IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A VERY REAL. POSSIBILITY EVEN IN THIS LAST TIME. WINTER SEASON. IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WINTER SEASON WE ALMOST HAD A WE HAD AN UNDERMINE A LEVEE NEXT TO YUBA CITY. CITY OF SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. HAD THAT LEVY. HAVE BEEN BREACHED. NO SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE'S LIVES PROPERTY I WOULD HAVE BEEN WOULD HAVE BEEN AT RISK AND THIS. THIS RISK IS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE CALIFORNIA'S LEVEES AND FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE WAS GIVEN A DEGRADING. AB BY THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS. AND IF YOU KNOW. THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY FLOOD. HAS BEEN PART OF OUR HISTORY HAS BEEN. YA SINCE ITS FOUNDING AL WE HAVE FACED THE PROSPECT AND HAVE BEEN. BATTLING. THE INLAND SEA AS IT'S CALLED. AND YOU KNOW EVEN. LELAND STANFORD I REMIND PEOPLE WENT TO HIS INAUGURATION HERE AT THE CAPITOL BY BOAT BECAUSE SACRAMENTO WAS FLOODED. AND AT THE TIME. AND SO THERE'S A VERY REAL. ISSUE HERE THAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURES BECOME. DEFICIENT. IN IN NEED OF REPAIR IN NEED OF UPGRADE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN THE INVESTMENT TO DO SO SO I'VE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED. AN ANNUAL APPROPRITION OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE STATE BUDGET. TO ALLOCATED TOWARDS THE STATE'S FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE NOW THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. NEAR WE NEED TO HAVE BETTER SETTLEMENT. MANAGEMENT IN IN OUR FLOOD WAYS THAT SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND BUT ONE OF THE BIG THINGS IS JUST DEALING WITH THESE CRITICAL REPAIRS TO LEVEES. AND YOU KNOW BY HAVING THIS ANNUAL APPROPRIATION WE CAN REALLY START TO GET AT SOME OF THE. YOU KNOW THE MOST PROBLEMATIC AREAS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. NEAR THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN IDENTIFIED. THE NEED TO INVEST SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY ONE BILLION OVER THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. THAT'S A BIG NUMBER THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO TO ADDRESS IN TERMS OF CAPITAL PROJECTS. BUT I LOOK AT THIS HUNDRED MILLION AS JUST YOUR BASIC ANA. OF ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT'S BEING TAKEN CARE OF. ONE THING THAT I PROPOSES EITHER A CONTINUOUS ONE HUNDRED MILLION OR IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. AT LEAST MAYBE DOING A ONE TIME FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION THIS YEAR. TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG THERE'S IT AND NDW ARE HAS TESTIFIED THAT THERE'S A HUGE BACKLOG IN REPAIRS THAT NEED TO GET. AT THAT NEED TO GET DONE. SEVERAL HOT HOT SPOTS ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THIS IS A LARGER ISSUE THAN JUST ONE COUNTY OR ONE DISTRICT THIS AFFECTS ALL CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE FORMED IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND THE SENATE A FLOOD CONTROL CAUCUS THAT'S TWENTY NINE MEMBERS. AND WE ARE MAKING THAT REQUEST ON BEHALF OF THE CAUCUS. WE HAVE. EIGHTEEN MEMBERS WHO HAVE SIGNED ON TO. THIS BUDGET REQUEST. BY MAKING THIS INVESTMENT NOW WE CAN SAVE LIVES PROPERTY. AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAVE THE STATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH IS ANOTHER THING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT BECAUSE OF THE PATERNAL CASE. A FEW YEARS BACK THE STATE IS LIABLE IF ONE OF THESE LEVEES BREAKS AND CAUSES DAMAGE TO LIVES AND PROPERTY. I'M A BELIEVE THE LAST KNOWS NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX. THAT WE WERE FOUND LIABLE FOR UNDER THE PATERNAL CASE. THAT BELIEVE THE NUMBER THERE WAS SOME AROUND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THE STATE WAS FOUND LIABLE FOR. IF IT HAPPENS TODAY WE'RE TALKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE CAN POTENTIALLY BE LIABLE FOR SO. MAKING AN INVESTMENT NOW MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND I WOULD ASK THE. THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THIS REQUEST. AGAIN IF. EITHER AS A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OR AT LEAST TRYING TO ADDRESS AND IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY THE BACKLOG OF REPAIRS ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT. WENDY RIGOROUS WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES ARE AWKWARD AND STRONG SUPPORTER THIS WE ALSO TESTIFIED IN THE SENATE SUB.
