00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:46.850
pBEST EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE

00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:48.985
IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE'RE

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:50.787
GOING TO NEED TO ADAPT WE'RE NOT

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:51.688
REDUCING EMISSIONS FAST ENOUGH

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:53.590
AND- UNFORTUNATELY IT'S LONG

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:55.158
BEEN CLEAR THAT GRADUALLY

00:49:55.225 --> 00:49:56.793
WARMING CLIMATES ARE GONNA MAKE

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.529
EXTREME OF ANTS LIKE EXTREME

00:49:59.596 --> 00:50:02.332
HEAT EVENTS EXTREME HUMIDITY

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:04.267
EVENTS MUCH MORE COMMON. THIS IS

00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:06.837
PROBABLY THE MOST CERTAIN OF THE

00:50:06.903 --> 00:50:08.472
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:09.740
BECAUSE AS WE SHIFT THE MEAN

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.341
TEMPERATURE GRADUALLY THAT'S

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:12.876
GOING TO MAKE THE ONE IN ONE

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:15.545
HUNDRED YEAR EVENT INTO A ONE IN

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:17.013
TEN YEAR EVENTS. THE ONE IN A

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:17.647
THOUSAND YEAR EVENT INTO A ONE

00:50:17.714 --> 00:50:20.217
IN FIFTY YEAR EVENT. AND SO

00:50:20.283 --> 00:50:21.385
EXTREME HEAT IMPACTS ARE LIKELY

00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:23.286
WOULD INCREASE THROUGH TIME-

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:24.855
NEWER SCIENCE INDICATES THAT

00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:25.856
MUCH HIGHER RATES OF WORKER

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:28.425
ACCIDENT AND INJURY- IN ADDITION

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:30.260
TO HEAT STRESS DURING TREATMENT

00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:34.097
EVENTS ARE COMMON- ENDS. WE NEED

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:37.200
MUCH MORE STUDY- TO UNDERSTAND

00:50:37.267 --> 00:50:39.770
BOTH HOW TO DETECT EXTREME HEAT

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:45.342
HOW TO- MEASURE ITS IMPACTS AND

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:45.942
THEN HOPEFULLY HOW TO PREVENT

00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:46.910
THEM. A CRITICAL CHALLENGE RIGHT

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:48.945
NOW IS. DEFENSE WHAT EXTREME

00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:51.815
HEAT MEANS DEPENDS ON CONTEXT

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:55.952
DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT- TYPES OF

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:58.822
CLIMATES- CREATE DIFFERENT

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:01.091
CONTEXT WHICH CAN HE CAN OCCUR.

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:03.727
AVERAGE DAY IN SAN FRANCISCO-

00:51:03.794 --> 00:51:04.895
ARE STRAIGHT AVERAGE AT AN

00:51:04.961 --> 00:51:06.396
EXTREME HEAT EVENTS AND JUST GO

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:08.565
IS NOT GONNA MAKE SOMEONE FROM

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:12.302
BAKERSFIELD LAKE TWICE- AND SO.

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:14.171
WHAT WE NEED CRITICALLY AT THE

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:15.405
STATE LEVEL TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:17.040
ITS IMPACT IS A COMMISSION TO

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:19.176
REALLY THINK ABOUT. HOW TO HELP

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:20.444
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHICH

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:22.446

FOR DEFINING STREAM HE ARE SO

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:33.256
THAT THEN WE COULD DETECT. AND

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:35.959
WARN. AND MEASURE IMPACTS IN A

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:38.061
SYSTEMATIC WAY AND THAT'S NOT

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:39.429
CURRENTLY POSSIBLE I THINK IT'S

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:42.899

CHEMICALS MAKE YOU HOT. THE

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:58.179
PROBLEM WITH USING A URINE TEST.

01:21:58.246 --> 01:22:01.883
IS THAT IT CHEST NOT FOR THC BUT

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:03.418
FOR THINGS THAT ARE LEFT OVER

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:06.755
AFTER YOU HAVE SMOKED THC AND

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.723
YOU'RE DOWN. AND FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.525
SMOKE REGULARLY THIS COULD BE A

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:13.328
MONTH LATER OF WHICH CERTAINLY

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:15.997

WORK- LU

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:24.039
WE TEST FOR THC. THEN WE KNOW

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:25.940
IT'S LIKE AN ALCOHOL TEST A

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:28.610
BLOOD ALCOHOL TEST. IF YOU USE

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:30.945
AN ORAL SWAB TEST FOR THC IT'S

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:33.615
RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE TEST. AND

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:35.383
IF SOMEONE IS POSITIVE THEY

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.918
SHOULD NOT BE AT THE WORK PLACE

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:38.853
AND FRANKLY I DON'T THINK I KEEP

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:43.291
THEM ON THE WORK FORCE VERY LONG

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:45.660

IS ABLE TO WORK ON THE JOB. AS

01:22:55.904 --> 01:22:57.605

THEY'VE SMOKED IN THE LAST MONTH

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:03.345

SOMETHING WE DEAL WITH A LOT AND

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:33.928

BEEN GOING ON FOR. THIS IS A

01:35:54.515 --> 01:35:55.716
BILL OR LEGISLATION SOME OF THIS

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:57.485
HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM NUMBER OF

OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:17.571
THERE WERE EFFORTS TO TRY TO

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:19.874
FIND THAT NEARLY CRAFTED

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:20.741
EXEMPTIONS AGAIN BECAUSE

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:22.643

THINGS OF THAT NATURE- THAT IS

01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:30.417
WHERE. THE EXEMPTION FOUND OUT

01:36:30.484 --> 01:36:31.919
THEIR OTHER INDUSTRIES AND THEIR

01:36:31.986 --> 01:36:33.854
SON THAT CAME HERE IN OPPOSITION

01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:35.723

THOSE SIMILAR EXEMPTIONS- THAT'S

01:36:45.566 --> 01:36:53.240
THAT'S FINE BUT YOU KNOW THE-

01:36:53.307 --> 01:36:58.012
AND SO- ULTIMATELY- THERE WAS AN

01:36:58.078 --> 01:37:01.682
AGREEMENT OF BOTH WITH. LABOR

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:03.751

01:37:10.824 --> 01:37:12.459
THEM THAT THEY BELIEVE THATALL

01:37:12.526 --> 01:37:14.528
THE TIME SHOULD BE TAKEN AND SO

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:17.131
IT WAS IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF

01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:18.999
ONE EMPLOYER OR WORK OR YOU KNOW

01:37:19.066 --> 01:37:19.967

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:30.644
NOT SET BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT

01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:31.645
HAPPENED OVER THE LAST COUPLE

01:37:31.712 --> 01:37:34.181
WEEKS HAS BEEN MANY YEARS OF

01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:35.049
CONVERSATION EFFORTS TO TRY TO

PARTICULAR FEELS THEY PUT.

01:37:48.395 --> 01:37:52.199
DECIDED MUTUALLY. THAT ALL THE

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:53.300
TESTS SHOULD BE APPLIED. I

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:54.768
APPRECIATE THAT I JUST I DO WANT

01:37:54.835 --> 01:37:56.904
SAY THAT I WISH THAT AND I KNOW

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:58.739

THAT THERE'S LABOR IS TO THE

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:04.011
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SOMETIMES A

01:38:04.078 --> 01:38:04.578
WHICH WOULD GIVE THE SAME

01:38:04.645 --> 01:38:06.146
DEFERENCE. TO OUR OTHER

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:07.047

AND IF WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT A

01:38:15.789 --> 01:38:17.658
POTATO MYSTERY AND CUT THEM OUT

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:19.126
OF SOMETHING. I THINK WE SHOULD

01:38:19.193 --> 01:38:20.694
BE VERY CAUTIOUS AND LOOK INTO

01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:21.996
OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT MIGHT HAVE

01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:24.164
SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES WITH IT.

01:38:24.231 --> 01:38:26.000

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:33.440
WITH THIS TO TRY TO WORK WITH

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:35.576
THEM AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT A

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.011
SOLUTION THAT. IS NOT AS ROBUST

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:38.612

ANY CONTRACTS THAT HAVE THAT

01:38:52.993 --> 01:38:54.928
WOULD BE IMPAIRED WITH PROJECT

01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:56.964
OWNERS BECAUSE- THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:58.899

01:38:58.966 --> 01:39:00.000
THEY HAVE PROJECTS AND THEY

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:01.402
ALREADY HAVE THEIR OWN CONTRACTS

01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:02.870
THAT DICTATE WHAT TESTING WILL

01:39:02.936 --> 01:39:04.938

PATH BUT I THINK THAT WE'RE ON.

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:27.014
A POSITIVE PATH FORWARD IS- EVEN

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.749
HEARD FROM J. REPRESENTED THERE

REALLY IS ABOUT BRING EQUITY- IT

01:41:41.094 --> 01:41:44.064
HAS SPACE THAT. ALLOWS WORKERS

01:41:44.131 --> 01:41:48.168
TO BE FREE- FROM THE KIND OF THE

HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. NOW

01:43:08.382 --> 01:43:09.750
WHAT THE CHAMBER DIDN'T SAY WHEN

01:43:09.816 --> 01:43:12.152
THEY SAID WE WANTED IN A

01:43:12.219 --> 01:43:13.120
DIFFERENT SECTION. WE HAVEN'T IN

01:43:13.186 --> 01:43:16.156
THE SECTION HERE BECAUSE IT IS

01:43:16.223 --> 01:43:19.560
EASIER TO ENFORCE THE LAW. OUR

01:43:19.626 --> 01:43:21.695
IF ONLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:24.898
BRING A COURSE OF ACTION. AND

01:43:24.965 --> 01:43:28.101
THEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND BY

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:29.102
PUTTING IT IN THE SECTION WE

01:43:29.169 --> 01:43:31.505
HAVE WE WILL ALLOW WORK TO

01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:34.975
REDRESS NOW IF THE CHAMBER WANTS

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:37.144
TO WORK WITH US AND THIS IS

01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:38.679
REALLY WHY IT'S A JOB KILLER BY

01:43:38.745 --> 01:43:41.415
THE WAY AND IT'S OKAY WE'RE GOOD

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:42.716

JOB KILLER BILL. NO IT THIS IS

01:43:54.828 --> 01:43:56.597
THE QUESTION QUESTION IN FOR. IF

01:43:56.663 --> 01:43:58.966
A PERSON FEELS THAT THEY- ARE

01:43:59.032 --> 01:44:00.500
NOT ALLOWED TO WORK BECAUSE

01:44:00.567 --> 01:44:02.669
THEY'VE USED CANNABIS OFF THE

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:05.606
JOB HAVE ALWAYS COME. THEN WHAT

01:44:05.672 --> 01:44:07.874
IS THEIR BODIES THEIR REMEDY. IF

01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:09.910
WE CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY TO FIND

01:44:09.977 --> 01:44:11.778
OF MEMORY I THINK THE CHAMBER

01:44:11.845 --> 01:44:13.780
CAN GO AWAY. I DON'T THINK IT'LL

01:44:13.847 --> 01:44:15.649
BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE ARE

01:44:15.716 --> 01:44:17.884
ALLOWING THAT PRE EMPLOYMENT

01:44:17.951 --> 01:44:21.355
TESTS- BELIEVE ME I DIDN'T WANT

01:44:21.421 --> 01:44:22.990
TO GIVE AN EXEMPTION TO THE

01:44:23.056 --> 01:44:25.025

BLAH. AND SO WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:31.331
IT BUT- I THINK THOSE CONTRACTS

01:44:31.398 --> 01:44:33.300
SHOULD CHANGE. I DON'T THINK

01:44:33.367 --> 01:44:35.535
THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

01:44:35.602 --> 01:44:38.338
BUT GIVEN THE WAY THE CONTRACTS

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:38.939
ARE WRITTEN I DON'T THINK WE

01:44:39.006 --> 01:44:42.242
HAVE A CHOICE. WE DON'T WANT.

01:44:42.309 --> 01:44:45.012

02:16:31.917 --> 02:16:33.485
REALLY BELIEVE THE SIZE AND

02:16:33.552 --> 02:16:35.020
BREADTH OF THAT COALITION

02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:37.589
REFLECTS THE- REACH AND SEVERITY

02:16:37.656 --> 02:16:40.225
OF THE PROBLEM. THAT GOES FAR

02:16:40.292 --> 02:16:41.927
DEEPER AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED

02:16:41.993 --> 02:16:43.562
THAN JUST AN INVASION OF WORKERS

02:16:43.628 --> 02:16:45.697
PRIVACY. AT ITS WORST THIS

02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:47.232
TECHNOLOGY REALLY DOES

02:16:47.299 --> 02:16:48.700
CONSTITUTE AN ATTACK ON

02:16:48.767 --> 02:16:49.467
VIRTUALLY ALL OF YOUR

02:16:49.534 --> 02:16:51.202
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AS A WORKER

02:16:51.269 --> 02:16:53.838
AND- WORSE YET IT'S OFTEN HIDDEN

02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:56.107
ONE. EXAMPLE OF AN APP WITH

02:16:56.174 --> 02:16:57.943
GEOLOCATION DATA WAS MENTIONED

02:16:58.009 --> 02:16:59.711
THAT'S A REALLY CRITICAL ONE FOR

02:16:59.778 --> 02:17:01.780
US BECAUSE THAT CAN BE USED TO

02:17:01.846 --> 02:17:03.348
TRACK A WORKER ON AND OFF THE

02:17:03.415 --> 02:17:04.616

02:17:04.683 --> 02:17:06.484
GRAVE RISK TO YOUR RIGHT TO

02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:07.752
ORGANIZE. THERE IS ALSO THE

02:17:07.819 --> 02:17:10.155
ISSUE OF SAY ON EMPLOYER GIVING

02:17:10.221 --> 02:17:11.823
YOU A COMPANY PROVIDED LAPTOP

02:17:11.890 --> 02:17:12.657
THAT CAN CONDUCT VIDEO

02:17:12.724 --> 02:17:14.759
SURVEILLANCE OF YOU WHEN YOU'RE

02:17:14.826 --> 02:17:16.795
IN YOUR HOME. VIDEOTAPING

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:17.529
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:19.764
BEHIND YOU AND USING THAT DATA

02:17:19.831 --> 02:17:22.834
THAT'LL- THIS COLLECTED. FOR THE

02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:25.370
PURPOSES OF ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT

02:17:25.437 --> 02:17:27.172
DECISIONS. ELDORET NOW KNOWLEDGE

02:17:27.238 --> 02:17:28.440
HE HAS REALLY PER TO THE POINT

02:17:28.506 --> 02:17:30.008
WHERE IT CAN BE USED TO DENY

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:31.610
WORKERS AN INTERVIEW TO ADJUST

02:17:31.676 --> 02:17:34.112
YOUR SCHEDULE DR PAY DISCIPLINE

02:17:34.179 --> 02:17:36.581
AND FIRE YOU. AND NO ONE REALLY

02:17:36.648 --> 02:17:38.583
EVEN KNOWS HOW IT WORKS IT'S

02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:39.951
JUST OUT THERE AND SO WITH ALL

02:17:40.018 --> 02:17:42.754
OF THE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:17:42.821 --> 02:17:44.556
CONCERNS IS THE FACT THAT THE

02:17:44.623 --> 02:17:45.624
WORKERS NOT EVEN AWARE THAT IT'S

02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:47.192
HAPPENING. AND SO THEY DON'T.

02:17:47.259 --> 02:17:48.460
HAPPENING UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE

02:17:48.526 --> 02:17:49.494
THEY'RE VERY LITTLE RIGHTS WITH

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:51.863
RESPECT TO IT AND SO AB SIXTEEN

02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:52.864
FIFTY ONE IS REALLY A

02:17:52.931 --> 02:17:53.698
COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO DEAL

02:17:53.765 --> 02:17:55.333
WITH ALL OF THESE. IT HAS THE

02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:56.635
AUTHOR MENTIONED GIVES A WORKER

02:17:56.701 --> 02:17:57.636
NOTICED THAT IT'S BEING USED.

02:17:57.702 --> 02:17:59.371
GIVES A WORKER THE RIGHT TO

02:17:59.437 --> 02:18:00.639
ACCESS AND CORRECT THE DATA

02:18:00.705 --> 02:18:02.107
WHERE WHERE THAT'S APPROPRIATE

02:18:02.173 --> 02:18:03.742
AND THEN ALSO STOP SOME OF THE

02:18:03.808 --> 02:18:04.609
WORST ABUSES. LIKE FACIAL

02:18:04.676 --> 02:18:06.211
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN LARGE

02:18:06.277 --> 02:18:08.446
PART BECAUSE OF ITS WELL

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:09.047
DOCUMENTED RACIALLY DISPARATE

02:18:09.114 --> 02:18:10.482
IMPACT AND ALSO OBVIOUSLY

02:18:10.548 --> 02:18:11.516
TRACKING WORKERS WHEN THEY'RE

02:18:11.583 --> 02:18:13.618
NOT AT WORK. BUT REALLY WANT TO

02:18:13.685 --> 02:18:15.820
FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE OF THE FACT

02:18:15.887 --> 02:18:17.022
THAT THE BILL REALLY DOESN'T BAN

02:18:17.088 --> 02:18:19.524
VERY MUCH. THAT IT ESSENTIALLY

02:18:19.591 --> 02:18:20.892
SAYS THE EMPLOYER CAN USE ALL OF

02:18:20.959 --> 02:18:22.193
THIS BUDGET WHEREVER IT MAKES

02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:23.528
SENSE WHEREVER IT'S RELATED TO

02:18:23.595 --> 02:18:25.730
THE TASK AT HAND. AND IN DOING

02:18:25.797 --> 02:18:27.465
SO WE THINK IT REALLY DOES

02:18:27.532 --> 02:18:29.567
FINALLY ALIGN. OUR STATUS IN

02:18:29.634 --> 02:18:31.236
CALIFORNIA AS A CENTER FOR

02:18:31.302 --> 02:18:32.504
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION BUT

02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:33.772
ALSO PLACE THAT REALLY RESPECTS

02:18:33.838 --> 02:18:36.675
WORKERS RIGHTS. AND REALLY

02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:37.742
BRINGS THEM TOGETHER IN A WAY

02:18:37.809 --> 02:18:40.779
THAT ALLOWS BOTH. IN A- SPECIAL

02:18:40.845 --> 02:18:42.180
TO EVERYONE INVOLVED SO WE URGE

02:18:42.247 --> 02:18:45.150
OUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR.

02:18:45.216 --> 02:18:47.786
THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON I HAVE

02:18:47.852 --> 02:18:48.953
THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE

02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:51.289
TEAMSTERS UNION TODAY JUST AS I

02:18:51.356 --> 02:18:52.657
DID WHEN I SERVED ON THE

02:18:52.724 --> 02:18:53.925
GOVERNOR'S FUTURE WORK

02:18:53.992 --> 02:18:56.127
COMMISSION WITH MISTER KALRA.

02:18:56.194 --> 02:18:57.562
AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT UNITED

02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:59.230
PARCEL SERVICE THE LARGEST

02:18:59.297 --> 02:19:01.266
UNIONIZED EMPLOYER IN THE UNITED

02:19:01.332 --> 02:19:03.802
STATES WITH THREE HUNDRED AND

02:19:03.868 --> 02:19:04.903
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TEAMSTERS.

02:19:04.969 --> 02:19:06.771
NOW I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT

02:19:06.838 --> 02:19:09.841
YOUR SMART PHONES IN YOUR CAR'S

02:19:09.908 --> 02:19:11.943
. BETWEEN A HAND HELD COMPUTER

02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:14.079
SENSORS ON THE TRUCKS AND A

02:19:14.145 --> 02:19:15.780
NAVIGATION SYSTEM HERE'S THE

02:19:15.847 --> 02:19:17.816
DATA THE UPS COLLECTS ON US

02:19:17.882 --> 02:19:20.218
EVERY DAY. OUR VEHICLE SPEED

02:19:20.285 --> 02:19:22.587
LOCATION HOW HARD WE HIT THE

02:19:22.654 --> 02:19:24.789
BRAKES. IDOLING TIME FUEL

02:19:24.856 --> 02:19:26.891
CONSUMPTION WHETHER WE HAVE OUR

02:19:26.958 --> 02:19:28.760
SEAT BELTS ON THE HOURS WE WORK

02:19:28.827 --> 02:19:29.794
AND HOW LONG IT TAKES TO MAKE

02:19:29.861 --> 02:19:32.430
DELIVERIES. THE SYSTEM EVEN TO

02:19:32.497 --> 02:19:34.766
MAKE SURE WE DON'T MAKE ANY LEFT

02:19:34.833 --> 02:19:36.634
TURNS ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE THAT

02:19:36.701 --> 02:19:39.003
TAKES MORE TIME AND USES MORE

02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:41.005
GAS. ROCKING ALL OF THIS IS

02:19:41.072 --> 02:19:43.475
CALLED TELEMATICS AND USED RIGHT

02:19:43.541 --> 02:19:45.043
IT ACTUALLY MAKES OUR JOBS

02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:47.612
EASIER AND MORE EFFICIENT. BUT

02:19:47.679 --> 02:19:49.781
THERE'S A DARK SIDE TO.

02:19:49.848 --> 02:19:51.449
TELEMATICS WORKS VERY WELL FOR

02:19:51.516 --> 02:19:53.485
U. P. S. IT HAD ITS MOST

02:19:53.551 --> 02:19:56.154
PROFITABLE YEAR EVER AND THANKS

02:19:56.221 --> 02:19:57.922
TO US THEY SHARE THOSE PROFITS

02:19:57.989 --> 02:20:00.058
WITH OUR MEMBERS. THE UNION

02:20:00.125 --> 02:20:02.527
CONTRACT EVEN SAYS NO DRIVER CAN

02:20:02.594 --> 02:20:04.395
GET FIRED BECAUSE OF

02:20:04.462 --> 02:20:06.264
SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY THE

02:20:06.331 --> 02:20:08.500
HUMAN SUPERVISOR HAS TO OBSERVE

02:20:08.566 --> 02:20:11.269
YOUR BEHAVIOR NOT THE ALGORITHM.

02:20:11.336 --> 02:20:12.971
THIS ISN'T TRUE FOR AMAZON

02:20:13.037 --> 02:20:15.974
DRIVERS WHO GET FIRED WITH NO

02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:18.510
RECOURSE OR GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.

02:20:18.576 --> 02:20:20.979
THEY DO THE SAME WORK THAT WE DO

02:20:21.045 --> 02:20:21.746
AND ALL WORKERS SHOULD HAVE

02:20:21.813 --> 02:20:23.581
EQUAL RIGHTS NOT JUST UNION

ARE VERY COMMON LEGISLATIVE

02:24:26.891 --> 02:24:28.926
PROCESS ABSOLUTELY BUT- OUR

02:24:28.993 --> 02:24:30.728
CONCERN HERE IS THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:24:30.795 --> 02:24:32.296
TALKING TO THE SPONSORS ABOUT

02:24:32.363 --> 02:24:34.065

RIGHTS FOR MONTHS WE REACHED OUT

02:24:35.633 --> 02:24:37.568
IN THE FALL- BECAUSE OF ISSUES

02:24:37.635 --> 02:24:39.170
RELATED TO PROVISIONS OF THE

02:24:39.237 --> 02:24:41.839
CPRE THAT ARE GOING TO EXPIRE IN

02:24:41.906 --> 02:24:42.507
TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WHEN THEY

02:24:42.573 --> 02:24:43.608
TOLD US THAT THEY WERE EXPLORING

02:24:43.674 --> 02:24:45.376
A BILL DEALING WITH POTENTIALLY

02:24:45.443 --> 02:24:46.711
TRACKING EMPLOYEREMPLOYEES

02:24:46.778 --> 02:24:48.780

WE COMMITTED YOU KNOW TO TRYING

02:24:50.114 --> 02:24:51.649
TO WORK WITH THEM ON THAT THEY

02:24:51.716 --> 02:24:54.118
TOLD US REPEATEDLY THAT WE WOULD

IN FROM ONE WEEK TO TWO WEEKS-

02:24:57.922 --> 02:24:59.757
AND SO WE WERE QUITE FRANKLY

02:24:59.824 --> 02:25:01.726
SHOCKED ON MONDAY WHEN I WENT TO

02:25:01.793 --> 02:25:02.894

02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:05.029

HAD NEVER BEEN SET IN ADVANCE-

02:25:11.235 --> 02:25:13.738
AND SO AGAIN IT WAS JUST REALLY

02:25:13.805 --> 02:25:14.906
FRUSTRATING FOR US TO HAVE TO

02:25:14.972 --> 02:25:17.108

02:25:39.597 --> 02:25:41.199

THAT'S- SO FOR EXAMPLE IS

02:26:03.988 --> 02:26:05.223
BASICALLY AN EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE

02:26:05.289 --> 02:26:07.158
TO REVIEW EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE

02:26:07.225 --> 02:26:08.459

DISCIPLINARY ACT. THAT I ALSO

02:26:29.847 --> 02:26:31.149

PARAMETERS THAT WE NEED TO TALK

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:33.323
ABOUT BECAUSE YOU COULD PROGRAM

02:35:33.390 --> 02:35:34.425
THIS TO YOU COULD ACTUALLY-

02:35:34.491 --> 02:35:36.727
SEGREGATE OUT PEOPLE YOU DON'T

02:35:36.794 --> 02:35:37.561
WANT. IF IT'S PROGRAM IN

02:35:37.628 --> 02:35:39.596
INAPPROPRIATELY. AND WHICH I

02:35:39.663 --> 02:35:41.331
NEVER THOUGHT ANYONE WOULD DO

02:35:41.398 --> 02:35:44.968
THAT BUT I'D SAY NEED TO LEARN.

02:35:45.035 --> 02:35:47.071
THAT THIS WORLD IS A- AS BAD AS

02:35:47.137 --> 02:35:49.073
THEY THINK IT IS ALL THE TIME.

02:35:49.139 --> 02:35:50.474
AND THEN WHEN IT CAME TO A

02:35:50.541 --> 02:35:52.409
FACIAL RECOGNITION WHICH I'M UP.

02:35:52.476 --> 02:35:55.479
I WAS A BIG PROPONENT OF. UNTIL

02:35:55.546 --> 02:35:57.214
ONE DAY THEY DID THE FACIAL

02:35:57.281 --> 02:35:59.917
RECOGNITION AND SHOWED EVERYONE

02:35:59.983 --> 02:36:02.986
THAT HAD A FELONY. CONVICTION ON

02:36:03.053 --> 02:36:05.122
THE LAWN AND ONE OF THOSE PLACES

02:36:05.189 --> 02:36:08.158
WITH MINE. AND I DON'T HAVE A

02:36:08.225 --> 02:36:09.126
FELONY CONVICTION. AND THEY HAD

02:36:09.193 --> 02:36:11.261
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY SO

02:36:11.328 --> 02:36:14.031
AGAIN WHAT EVER PROGRAMMING THAT

02:36:14.098 --> 02:36:18.602
WAS DONE BY HUMANS- RESULTED IN-

02:36:18.669 --> 02:36:20.671
IN ACCURATE INFORMATION THAT

02:36:20.738 --> 02:36:23.006
COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT. IN THIS

02:36:23.073 --> 02:36:24.441
CASE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:36:24.508 --> 02:36:26.009
EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS TO COULD

02:36:26.076 --> 02:36:27.644
YOU COULD BE VERY DEVASTATING TO

02:36:27.711 --> 02:36:30.047
AN EMPLOYEE. AND SO WE NEED TO I

02:36:30.114 --> 02:36:31.749
STILL BELIEVE WE NEED TO DO USED

02:36:31.815 --> 02:36:33.484
THIS TECHNOLOGY AND I BELIEVE

02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:34.551
BUSINESSES NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:36:34.618 --> 02:36:36.720
USE IT. BUT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE

02:36:36.787 --> 02:36:38.689
SOME KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY OF

02:36:38.756 --> 02:36:42.693
STABILITY AND ABILITY TO ENSURE

02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:45.596
ACCURACY. IS THE PER MONTH BEING

02:36:45.662 --> 02:36:47.898
THAT WE DO WHEN WE USE ANY OF

02:36:47.965 --> 02:36:48.499
THESE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE I

02:36:48.565 --> 02:36:50.968
THE BILL. AND SO- DEFINITELY

02:36:51.034 --> 02:36:53.003
GOING TO MOVE THIS OUT OF THIS

02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:54.738
COMMITTEE- I THINK YOU'RE GONNA

02:36:54.805 --> 02:36:56.306
HAVE A REALLY ROBUST

02:36:56.373 --> 02:36:58.509
CONVERSATION. WITHOUT THE

02:36:58.575 --> 02:36:59.777
BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE

02:36:59.843 --> 02:37:01.779
CHAMBER AND YOU NEED TO KIND OF

02:37:01.845 --> 02:37:05.249
SAY WHAT ARE WE WHAT ARE WE

02:37:05.315 --> 02:37:06.383
TRYING TO DO. MMHM HOW ARE WE

02:37:06.450 --> 02:37:07.651
TRYING TO MAKE IT BETTER NOT

02:37:07.718 --> 02:37:09.319
ONLY FOR EMPLOYEES BUT DEPLOYER

02:37:09.386 --> 02:37:11.855
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. MAKING

02:37:11.922 --> 02:37:13.991
SURE THE DEUCE INTEGRITY. IN

02:37:14.057 --> 02:37:15.793
WHAT EVER WE DECIDE WE'RE GOING

02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:17.961
TO DO AND I'M SO GLAD WE'RE-

02:37:18.028 --> 02:37:19.196
WORK WERE NOW BEGINNING THIS

02:37:19.263 --> 02:37:21.532
CONVERSATION I MEAN I WAS ONLY

02:37:21.598 --> 02:37:23.600
HAD A LITTLE PIECE OF IT. BUT I

02:37:23.667 --> 02:37:25.302
TO REALIZE HOW ROBUST.

02:37:25.369 --> 02:37:26.904
TECHNOLOGY CAN BE RIGHT NOW IN

02:37:26.970 --> 02:37:28.639
THE EMPLOYMENT SECTOR AND I'M

02:37:28.705 --> 02:37:29.640
GLAD WE'RE BEGINNING THIS

02:37:29.706 --> 02:37:32.075
DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW AND I KNOW

02:37:32.142 --> 02:37:33.710
IT'S HARD. BUT LIKE LIKE LOVE

02:37:33.777 --> 02:37:35.345
THE CHAMBER SAID IS WHAT THIRTY

02:37:35.412 --> 02:37:37.548
THREE PAGES. OF THINGS WE NEED

02:37:37.614 --> 02:37:42.352

LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND I

02:37:50.427 --> 02:37:51.061
RECALL THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:37:51.128 --> 02:37:53.864
DISTINCTLY LOOK IT WAS AS HONEST

02:37:53.931 --> 02:37:54.765
AND WELL INTENTIONED QUESTIONS

02:37:54.832 --> 02:37:56.767
YOU THIS BY WOULD BE NECESSARY

02:37:56.834 --> 02:37:58.101
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN

02:37:58.168 --> 02:37:59.469
YOU'RE USING THESE KINDS OF

02:37:59.536 --> 02:38:00.504
ANALYTICS FOR MAKING SUCH

02:38:00.571 --> 02:38:03.207
CRITICAL DECISIONS IN ONE'S-

02:38:03.273 --> 02:38:05.409
EMPLOYMENT OF THE WORKERS DO A

02:38:05.475 --> 02:38:08.579
PRICE AND IT IS DOABLE AS WE

02:38:08.645 --> 02:38:10.981
HEARD FROM MR BLOCK. OF UPS DOES

02:38:11.048 --> 02:38:12.683
IT AND THEY DO IT IN WITH LABOR

02:38:12.749 --> 02:38:13.851
CONTRACTS EVERYONE AGREES THAT

02:38:13.917 --> 02:38:14.818
THERE'S CERTAIN DATA THAT IS

02:38:14.885 --> 02:38:16.019
NECESSARY FOR GREATER

02:38:16.086 --> 02:38:18.322
EFFICIENCY- THAT HELPS EVERYONE

02:38:18.388 --> 02:38:18.889
INVOLVED HELPS THEM BECOME

02:38:18.956 --> 02:38:22.326
PROFITABLE MORE PROFITABLE AND

02:38:22.392 --> 02:38:25.229
SO I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO

02:38:25.295 --> 02:38:26.563
HAVE A WELL INTENTIONED AND

02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:28.732
REASONED AND A CONVERSATION WITH

02:38:28.799 --> 02:38:30.400
THE CHAMBER OR ANYONE ELSE IF

02:38:30.467 --> 02:38:31.768
THEIR GOAL IS TO HAVE AN

02:38:31.835 --> 02:38:35.672
ENDPOINT. THAT ACTUALLY HELPS US

02:38:35.739 --> 02:38:37.674
. PUT SOME PRIDE. ON TECHNOLOGY

02:38:37.741 --> 02:38:39.309
THE CITY THAT THE GOAL IS JUST

02:38:39.376 --> 02:38:40.878
TO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT'S

02:38:40.944 --> 02:38:42.646
DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I

02:38:42.713 --> 02:38:44.348
DON'T WATCH THE TV SHOW

02:38:44.414 --> 02:38:44.982
SEVERANCE LATELY. I THINK WHEN

02:38:45.048 --> 02:38:47.417
MOST OF US WATCH IT. WE SEE SOME

02:38:47.484 --> 02:38:48.852
DYSTOPIAN WORKPLACE HELP PLACE

02:38:48.919 --> 02:38:50.254
TO THE FUTURE HELLSCAPE OF THE

02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:53.490
FUTURE. SOMETIMES A PIECE OF THE

02:38:53.557 --> 02:38:55.525
CHAMBER OF THAT THAT'S OUR TEN

02:38:55.592 --> 02:38:56.660
YEAR PLAN. AND WE CAN'T HELP

02:38:56.727 --> 02:38:58.795
THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME SENSE.

02:38:58.862 --> 02:39:00.264
THAT WORKERS HAVE RIGHTS THEY

02:39:00.330 --> 02:39:01.999
HAVE SELF DETERMINATION IN THE

02:39:02.065 --> 02:39:04.034
WORKPLACE. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN

02:39:04.101 --> 02:39:05.502
THAT THERE AREN'T RULES WE ALL

02:39:05.569 --> 02:39:07.471
ABIDE BY RULES IN OUR WORKPLACE.

02:39:07.537 --> 02:39:08.605
AND MANY TIMES THOSE RULES CAN

02:39:08.672 --> 02:39:10.607
CREATE GREATER EFFICIENCY. BUT

02:39:10.674 --> 02:39:12.542
THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT WE NEED

02:39:12.609 --> 02:39:15.379
TO REALLY. DIVE DEEP INTO THIS

02:39:15.445 --> 02:39:17.814
TO DIG DEEP. AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:39:17.881 --> 02:39:18.315
WE'RE HAVING MEANINGFUL

02:39:18.382 --> 02:39:20.851
CONVERSATIONS NOT DELAYS ARE NOT

02:39:20.918 --> 02:39:22.019
JUST WAYS OF CALLING EVERYTHING

02:39:22.085 --> 02:39:23.720
A JOB OR THE YOU DON'T LIKE. BUT

02:39:23.787 --> 02:39:25.422
ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE TABLE IF

02:39:25.489 --> 02:39:28.325

THOUSAND. TRUCK DRIVERS AND SO

02:52:20.730 --> 02:52:21.764
WHEN THE ONLINE IS THE ONLY

02:52:21.831 --> 02:52:23.666
HISTORY SAYS THIS WE DEAL WITH

02:52:23.733 --> 02:52:24.667
THIS ON A DAILY BASIS I AM

02:52:24.734 --> 02:52:26.502
CURIOUS LIKE. IF THERE'S A

02:52:26.569 --> 02:52:27.937
ROUGHLY SHORT OF EIGHTY THOUSAND

02:52:28.004 --> 02:52:28.871
TRUCK DRIVERS BASED ON THAT

02:52:28.938 --> 02:52:31.407
STUDY- HOW CAN WE SAY THAT

02:52:31.474 --> 02:52:32.608
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE AND WHAT

02:52:32.675 --> 02:52:34.410
DOES THIS BILL DO TO. ALLOW THE

02:52:34.477 --> 02:52:35.745
BECAUSE I MEAN WE'VE ALL DEALT

02:52:35.812 --> 02:52:38.247
WITH AB FIVE FOR A LITTLE WHILE

02:52:38.314 --> 02:52:40.183
AND I THINK THIS BILL IS- IS

02:52:40.249 --> 02:52:41.784
SIMPLY ANOTHER. QUITE FRANKLY

02:52:41.851 --> 02:52:44.020
SHOT OF THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY-

02:52:44.087 --> 02:52:45.922
TO GET IT UNDER HER ARM A LABOR

02:52:45.988 --> 02:52:49.125
AGREEMENT. AND WHETHER WE HAVE A

02:52:49.192 --> 02:52:49.959
DISAGREEMENT ON THAT- IS NOT

02:52:50.026 --> 02:52:51.661
WHAT I'M ORDER. AND ALLOW MY

02:52:51.728 --> 02:52:53.496
CONCERN TODAY RIGHT NOW. BUT I

02:52:53.563 --> 02:52:56.632
DO THINK. WITH EIGHTY THOUSAND.

02:52:56.699 --> 02:52:59.302
VACANCIES ANYTHING THAT WE DO

02:52:59.368 --> 02:53:01.838
TO. REDUCE THAT IS GOING TO BE

02:53:01.904 --> 02:53:03.840
PROBLEMATIC. EVEN WHEN WE TALK

02:53:03.906 --> 02:53:06.476
ABOUT CLEAN VEHICLES. RIGHT NOW

02:53:06.542 --> 02:53:07.543
THERE'S NOT A VEHICLE OUT THERE

02:53:07.610 --> 02:53:09.212
IT'S CLEAN. SO WHEN WE MOVED

02:53:09.278 --> 02:53:11.514
THROUGH THESE POLICIES I THINK

02:53:11.581 --> 02:53:13.382
WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS

02:53:13.449 --> 02:53:14.717
ABOUT THIS. AT A VERY HONEST

02:53:14.784 --> 02:53:17.253
ABOUT THIS AND HAVE TO SLOW THIS

02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:18.521
THING DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY JUST

02:53:18.588 --> 02:53:19.789

SORRY JUST EVER SO GENTLY ON

02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:27.196
THAT WE DO HAVE A- A SIGNIFICANT

02:53:27.263 --> 02:53:28.965
SHORTAGE OF TRUCK DRIVERS IN THE

02:53:29.031 --> 02:53:32.969
COUNTRY. WHO ELSE. COMMON

02:53:33.035 --> 02:53:35.671

INCREASED NUMBER OF TRUCKERS BUT

02:53:59.662 --> 02:54:01.397
THEN THERE'S SOME LIMIT TO THAT

02:54:01.464 --> 02:54:03.366
AND I THINK LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS

02:54:03.432 --> 02:54:05.301
SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR- MOVE IN

02:54:05.368 --> 02:54:07.570

INCREASE THE COST BY 325% BUT

03:03:45.981 --> 03:03:48.851
THE STUDY WENT ON. TO CONCLUDE

03:03:48.917 --> 03:03:50.119
THAT BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER

03:14:17.979 --> 03:14:18.980
ADVANTAGE OF A SUBSIDY THAT

03:14:19.047 --> 03:14:20.815
ACTUALLY IMPACTS LOW INCOME

03:14:20.882 --> 03:14:22.851
COMMUNITIES AND RENTERS. IN THE

03:14:22.917 --> 03:14:25.253

03:14:25.320 --> 03:14:29.157
TOGETHER BY THE P. UC TITLED-

03:14:29.224 --> 03:14:30.658
UTILITY COSTS IN THE

03:14:30.725 --> 03:14:32.594
AFFORDABILITY OF THE GRID OF THE

03:14:32.660 --> 03:14:34.763
FUTURE. THE REPORT ITSELF

03:14:34.829 --> 03:14:36.898
THROUGH AN AND DIDN'T STUDY.

03:14:36.965 --> 03:14:39.200
CLEARLY LAID OUT THAT. THE

03:14:39.267 --> 03:14:40.835
ROOFTOP SOLAR INITIATIVE THAT WE

03:14:40.902 --> 03:14:42.637
HAVE NOW THROUGH MA'AM THAT THE

03:14:42.704 --> 03:14:44.639

03:14:47.075 --> 03:14:49.244
WEALTHY HOMEOWNERS AT THE COST

03:14:49.310 --> 03:14:51.546
AND THE COST SHIFT OF RENTERS

03:14:51.613 --> 03:14:52.714
AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF

03:14:52.781 --> 03:14:55.950
COLOR THIS IS WHY WE ARE NOT

03:14:56.017 --> 03:14:58.253
INITIALLY TOP- ACTUALLY. DOING

03:14:58.319 --> 03:14:59.587
IT RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL

03:14:59.654 --> 03:15:01.589

NOT ONLY SPEAKS TO SIP COATS.

03:15:08.696 --> 03:15:10.298
BUT THE CENSUS TRACKS THAT WILL

03:15:10.365 --> 03:15:12.634
GIVE US THE DATA NECESSARY ON

03:15:12.700 --> 03:15:14.769
ETHNICITY AND INCOME TO ENSURE

03:15:14.836 --> 03:15:16.738
THAT MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE THE

03:15:16.805 --> 03:15:18.073
REPORTS NECESSARY TO ACTUALLY BE

03:15:18.139 --> 03:15:19.841
ABLE TO DO EQUITY WHEN IT COMES

03:15:19.908 --> 03:15:22.177
TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. SO THE

03:15:22.243 --> 03:15:24.079
CONVERSATION AROUND CLIMATE

03:15:24.145 --> 03:15:26.448
CHANGE AND CLIMATE JUSTICE AND

03:15:26.514 --> 03:15:28.583
THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION ON THE

03:15:28.650 --> 03:15:31.419
GREEN NEW DEAL INCLUDES A PILLAR

03:15:31.486 --> 03:15:32.921
THAT SAYS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE

03:15:32.987 --> 03:15:35.356
AND CLIMATE JUSTICE MUST

03:15:35.423 --> 03:15:36.858
INCLUDE. A TRANSITIONAL

03:15:36.925 --> 03:15:39.394
WORKFORCE FOR CLEAN GREEN

03:15:39.461 --> 03:15:42.363
RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS SO YOU

03:15:42.430 --> 03:15:44.099
CAN'T SAY LESS SHUTDOWN FOSSIL

03:15:44.165 --> 03:15:46.334
FUELS BUT LET'S ALSO NOT PAY

03:15:46.401 --> 03:15:48.369
WORKERS THE RATE THAT THEY

03:15:48.436 --> 03:15:49.537
SHOULD BE PAYING TO MAKE A

03:15:49.604 --> 03:15:51.539
LIVING WAGE AND BE ABLE TO LOOK

03:15:51.606 --> 03:15:52.607
IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE

03:15:52.674 --> 03:15:53.875

BE. TRADITIONALLY YOU ARE BOTH

03:16:06.821 --> 03:16:08.056
YOU CANNOT SAY THAT YOU ONLY

03:16:08.123 --> 03:16:09.791
CARE ABOUT CLIMATE AND THEN NOT

03:16:09.858 --> 03:16:10.925
CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT

03:16:10.992 --> 03:16:12.727
ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES

03:16:12.794 --> 03:16:13.628
THAT YOU ALLEGEDLY ARE TRYING TO

03:16:13.695 --> 03:16:16.664

03:16:22.904 --> 03:16:24.472
WAY IN WHICH WE TALK ABOUT

03:16:24.539 --> 03:16:25.874
ENERGY AND THE WAY THAT WE-

03:16:25.940 --> 03:16:29.511
BRING IN A NEW. CLEAN GREEN

03:16:29.577 --> 03:16:31.212
ENERGY WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:16:31.279 --> 03:16:33.081

03:16:33.148 --> 03:16:34.682
ABLE TO LIVE IN THE STATE AND TO

03:16:34.749 --> 03:16:36.851
LIVE WITH DIGNITY THIS IS WHY

03:16:36.918 --> 03:16:38.419
LABOR IS A BIG PART OF THE

03:16:38.486 --> 03:16:39.954
CONVERSATION THIS IS WHY. AT THE

03:16:40.021 --> 03:16:41.489

MINIMUM THAT'S THE FLOOR THAT'S

03:16:44.826 --> 03:16:45.660

HAVE CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVISTS

03:16:56.204 --> 03:16:58.506
AND CLIMATE ADVOCATES UNDERSTAND

03:16:58.573 --> 03:17:01.209

I HAVE A LOT MY DISTRICT I ALSO

03:18:36.704 --> 03:18:37.805
HAVE A LOT OF POOR COMMUNITIES

03:18:37.872 --> 03:18:39.607
THAT HAVE ALMOST ZERO. IN MY

03:18:39.674 --> 03:18:40.541
DISTRICT YEAH A LOT OF PEOPLE

03:18:40.608 --> 03:18:41.943

THE ONES ON THE ROOF PUTTING UP.

03:18:44.545 --> 03:18:45.847
THE PANELS. ARE MAKING CLOSE TO

03:18:45.913 --> 03:18:48.116
MINIMUM WAGE. AND SO WE HAVE TO

03:18:48.182 --> 03:18:52.287
COULD BE CONCERNED EQUALLY ABOUT

03:18:52.353 --> 03:18:54.122
BOTH THE WE- AND SO. I KNOW IT'S

03:18:54.188 --> 03:18:55.723
BEEN A THAT I'M IS ARTISTS OF

03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:56.724
THE EXPANSION SOLAR POWER POWER

03:18:56.791 --> 03:18:58.826
SYSTEM. MANY YEARS IN THE

03:18:58.893 --> 03:19:00.028
COUNCIL AND I CONTINUE TO BE.

03:19:00.094 --> 03:19:01.729
BUT WE CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE

03:19:01.796 --> 03:19:03.564
CONDITIONS OF THE WORKERS. THAT

03:19:03.631 --> 03:19:05.233
ARE PUTTING UP THOSE PANELS ON

03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:07.101
THESE AGAINST LARGE PROJECTS AND

03:19:07.168 --> 03:19:08.436
THE DATA COLLECTION IS CRITICAL

03:19:08.503 --> 03:19:10.238
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DO WITH

03:19:10.305 --> 03:19:11.539
THE REST. RIGHT BECAUSE WE NEED

03:19:11.606 --> 03:19:13.641
THAT DAY ALL OF US SEE THAT

03:19:13.708 --> 03:19:14.509
DATA. TO FIGURE OUT. IF THE

03:19:14.575 --> 03:19:16.611
PROGRAM COULD BE DONE BETTER

03:19:16.678 --> 03:19:17.545
DONE DIFFERENTLY- IT'S BEEN A

03:19:17.612 --> 03:19:19.080
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM LIKE A LOT OF

03:19:19.147 --> 03:19:20.548
NEW TECHNOLOGIES INITIALLY IT'S

03:19:20.615 --> 03:19:22.183
THOSE A HOW THE WEALTH. LOGICAL

03:19:22.250 --> 03:19:23.951
CARS OR EXAMPLE DOES HAVE THE

03:19:24.018 --> 03:19:25.720
RESOURCES ARE ABLE TO BE THE FOR

03:19:25.787 --> 03:19:27.488
EARLY ADOPTERS BUT WE CANNOT BE

03:19:27.555 --> 03:19:28.823
SUCCESSFUL UNTIL WE GET

03:19:28.890 --> 03:19:30.692
EVERYONE. THE ABILITY TO ADOPT

03:19:30.758 --> 03:19:32.126
THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND IN THE

03:19:32.193 --> 03:19:33.628
MEANTIME. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

03:19:33.695 --> 03:19:35.029
MAKING THOSE TECHNOLOGIES AND

03:19:35.096 --> 03:19:36.531
INSTALLING THEM. NEEDED HAVE

03:19:36.597 --> 03:19:38.099
WORKED WITH DIGNITY AND I

03:19:38.166 --> 03:19:40.001
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A GREAT.%

03:19:40.068 --> 03:19:41.269
FIRST STEP I WOULD ENCOURAGE

03:19:41.336 --> 03:19:42.637
EVERYONE INCLUDING MY DEAR

FRIENDS INDIVISIBLE TO RECOGNIZE

03:19:44.806 --> 03:19:47.508
THE VALUE OF THE WORKERS AND HOW

03:19:47.575 --> 03:19:49.377
WE CAN COME TOGETHER. AND

03:19:49.444 --> 03:19:50.011
RECOGNIZE. THESE LARGE PRIVATE.

03:19:50.078 --> 03:19:51.279
COMMERCIAL PROJECTS. WE'RE

03:19:51.346 --> 03:19:52.347
TALKING ABOUT INCREDIBLY

03:19:52.413 --> 03:19:55.083
EXPENSIVE LARGE SCALE THESE ARE

03:19:55.149 --> 03:19:55.683

03:19:55.750 --> 03:19:57.518
YOU KNOW. A LARGE COMMERCIAL

03:19:57.585 --> 03:19:58.820
COMPLEX WHICH WE CERTAINLY WANT

03:19:58.886 --> 03:20:01.055
TO ENCOURAGE. MORE SOLAR. BUT AT

03:20:01.122 --> 03:20:02.523
THE SAME TIME LET'S THINK ABOUT

03:20:02.590 --> 03:20:03.624
WHO'S ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK TO

03:20:03.691 --> 03:20:06.561
PUT THE SOLAR PANELS UP THERE.

03:20:06.627 --> 03:20:09.364
SO THE DOES THIS AS A JOINT I

03:20:09.430 --> 03:20:10.431
RECOMMENDATION- BUT YOU WOULD

03:20:10.498 --> 03:20:12.834

COMMITTEE. AND WE CONTINUE TO

03:20:27.148 --> 03:20:28.783
SEE VARIOUS DIFFERENT TYPES OF

03:20:28.850 --> 03:20:30.518
CONVERSATION WHEN IT COMES TO.

03:20:30.585 --> 03:20:32.887
CALIFORNIA REACHING ITS CLIMATE

03:20:32.954 --> 03:20:33.788

OF THE ORIGINAL. ENERGY

03:20:43.331 --> 03:20:45.032
PRODUCERS COAL MINERS. WHEN WE

03:20:45.099 --> 03:20:47.435
TRANSITIONED FROM COAL TO
