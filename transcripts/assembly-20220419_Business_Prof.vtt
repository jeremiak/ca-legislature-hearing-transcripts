VACCINES. I SEE THESE IMPACTS AT

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:19.283
MY WORK. HE AS AN EXAMPLE I SAW

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.952
WOMEN IN THEIR SEVENTIES WITH

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:21.819

WOULD SAY I GUESS IT COULD BE

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.790
NINETEEN SHE REFUSED TO BELIEVE

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:26.390
SHE HAD COVERED NINETEEN SHE

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:27.225
SAID SHE HAD THE FLU. THEN SHE

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.193
TOLD ME THAT IF SHE DID HAVE

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.829
CODE NINETEEN I GAVE IT TO HER.

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:33.364
AND THEN SHE SAID I GAVE IT TO

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:34.265
HER BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE MONEY

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:37.001

AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE I DO NOT

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:43.374
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HER. ANOTHER

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:45.743
EXAMPLE. IS- A TRAGIC EVENT WITH

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.478
A YOUNG MAN IN HIS TWENTIES WHO

00:35:47.545 --> 00:35:49.580
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THAT HE HAD.

00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:50.882
AN UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITION

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:51.649
IF YOU HAD SEEN HIM WALKING DOWN

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:53.551
THE STREET. BUT THREE DAYS AFTER

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:55.152
GETTING CO THAT HE CAME INTO MY

00:35:55.219 --> 00:35:57.121
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. GASPING

00:35:57.188 --> 00:35:58.623
FOR AIR WITH OXYGEN. OXYGENATION

00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:01.058
IN THE SIXTIES LOOK LIKE HE WAS

00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:03.261
DROWNING- THAT PATIENT DIED IN A

00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:05.997
MY KAHLER MY CARE THAT DAY. AND

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:08.065
DISINFORMATION KILL HIM. IF HE

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:09.867
WERE VACCINATED HE WOULD

00:36:09.934 --> 00:36:15.306
OTHERWISE BE ALIVE- THEY'RE OURS

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:16.674
THERE'S TWO THINGS I REALLY WANT

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:19.810
TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT AT THAT

00:36:19.877 --> 00:36:21.145
YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THE SAY IN

00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:22.713
AND MAYBE MAKE MENTION THOSE TWO

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.415
THINGS KIND OF QUICKLY YEAH I

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:26.617
APOLOGIZE NO PERFECT- IS WE GOT

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:27.818
TO STOP THE DISINFORMATION

00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:29.787
PIPELINE AND WHAT THAT IS THAT

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:31.055
THESE ARE DOCTORS WHO ARE

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:33.090
LICENSED PHYSICIAN TO CARRY THE

00:36:33.157 --> 00:36:35.059

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:39.730
WHICH NOW IN TWENTY NINE STATES

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:41.232
STATE LEGISLATURES ARE USING TO

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:44.735
INSTITUTIONALIZE DISINFORMATION

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:47.204
. AND WE NEED NO- STATE MEDICAL

00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:49.006

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:50.908
AGAINST LICENSE POSITIONS TO

00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:52.910
STOP THIS. THE SECOND THING WE

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:54.845
NEED TO DO IS ENSURE THAT WE

00:36:54.912 --> 00:36:57.181

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:01.953

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:53.824

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:56.694
A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT AND A CIVIL

00:39:56.761 --> 00:39:58.062
RIGHTS ATTORNEY I AM DISMAYED

00:39:58.129 --> 00:39:59.997
THE DEMOCRATS ARE BRINGING

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:02.233
FORWARD BILLS THAT UNDERMINE

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:04.535
CIVIL LIBERTIES HI I APPRECIATE

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:06.337
THAT THE CAN RECOGNIZE THE FIRST

00:40:06.403 --> 00:40:09.974
AMENDMENT PROBLEM PRESENTED BY

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.342
THIS BILL. BUT TWEAKING THE

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:13.244
LANGUAGE CANNOT REMEDY THE

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.045
PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S BAKED INTO

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:18.983
THE DNA OF THE BILL. THE PURPOSE

00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:22.219
IS TO RESTRICT SPEECH BASED ON

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:24.855
ITS CONTENTS. OUR CONSTITUTION

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:27.925
SIMPLY DOESN'T ALLOW THAT BROAD

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:30.761
INFRINGEMENT ON SPEECH EVEN IF

00:40:30.828 --> 00:40:33.063
THE SPEECH IS FALSE AND EVEN IF

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.365
THE INTENT OF THE LAW IS

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:37.368
COMPELLING. THE ANALYSIS STATES

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:39.336
THAT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY WOULD

00:40:39.403 --> 00:40:42.973
DEPEND ON HOW IT IS ENFORCED.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.842
BUT THE MERE POTENTIAL THAT IT

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:47.411
COULD BE APPLIED IN A WAY THE

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:49.213
CHILLS SPEECH RENDERS IT

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.981
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON ITS FACE

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:53.317
BEFORE IT'S EVEN ENFORCED. THIS

00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:56.987
BILL CAN'T BE SALVAGED BECAUSE

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:59.456
ONCE YOU STRIP AWAY EVERY

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:01.926
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ELEMENT WHAT

00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:03.861
YOU WOULD BE LEFT WITH. WOULD

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:07.932
DUPLICATE EXISTING MALL. SO WHAT

00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:09.133
WITH THE BILL ACTUALLY

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.168
ACCOMPLISH. IT WOULD DISCOURAGE

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:13.804
CONSCIENTIOUS DOCTORS FROM

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:15.606
EXPRESSING THEMSELVES FREELY

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:18.943

00:41:19.009 --> 00:41:21.011

00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:36.527

DISINFORMATION RESULTED IN HARM

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:46.355
TO A PATIENT. THIS ANALYSIS ALSO

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:47.156
ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF FREE

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:50.760
SPEECH I GOT A LOT OF EMAILS

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:52.662
ABOUT THAT. THIS HAS BEEN

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:54.897
DEBATED AND DECIDED BOTH OF THE

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:56.899
NINTH CIRCUIT AND THE SUPREME

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:59.135
COURT. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:01.170
BETWEEN FREE SPEECH AND

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:03.973
PROFESSIONAL CONTACT. AND STATES

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.208
MAY REGULATE PROFESSIONAL

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:07.043
CONDUCT EVEN THOUGH THAT CONTENT

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:08.945
TO MAKE INCIDENTLY INVOLVED

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:12.682

WE HAVE OUR INDIVIDUAL BELIEFS

01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:21.090
AND WE CAN FREELY SPEAK THOSE

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:24.060
BELIEFS IN PUBLIC. BUT WHEN THAT

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:25.761
SPREADS INTO OUR PRACTICE WHICH

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:27.330
LEADS TO DIRECT HARM OF

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:32.101
PATIENTS. THAT IS NOT OKAY. SO I

01:04:32.168 --> 01:04:34.937
MIGHT BELIEVE THAT HYPERTENSION

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:36.772
IS NOT A REAL MEDICAL CONDITION

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:38.307
. I MIGHT EVEN GO OUT AND SPEAK

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:40.943
ABOUT IT AT CONFERENCES. BUT IF

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.345

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.313

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:51.420

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:53.556
MEDICATIONS GO HOME. I HAVE

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:55.224
GIVEN YOU MISINFORMATION MY

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:56.892
PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT IS NOW A

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:59.362

NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN. WE AGREED

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:39.994
UPON AND PAID FOR A MONTH A

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:40.528
BOARDING AND TRAINING AND

01:36:40.594 --> 01:36:41.762
THROUGH THE COURSE OF THAT TIME.

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:43.297
THE TRAINERS COMMUNICATION

01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:44.899
SLOWLY DECREASED AND AFTER THE

01:36:44.965 --> 01:36:46.800
FIRST MONTH HE TOLD US HE NEEDED

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:48.102
MORE TIME. A MONTH LATER HE TOLD

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:50.237
US HE HAD TAKEN OUR DOG OUT OF

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:51.605
STATE WHILE HE WAS TRAINING

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:53.774
OTHER DOC. AS WE CONTINUE TO

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:54.408
PRESS THEM FOR INFORMATION IN

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:55.342
ASKING FOR DOOR TO BE RETURNED

01:36:55.409 --> 01:36:56.644
BECAUSE HE FINALLY REFUSED TO

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:59.446
SEND PICTURES OR UPDATE THE BILL

01:36:59.513 --> 01:37:01.448
ARE. WE HAD NO IDEA WHERE TO

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:03.384
FIND THEM. WE FINALLY GOT THE

01:37:03.450 --> 01:37:05.219
POLICE INVOLVED IN IT WAS THEN

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:06.187
WE DISCOVERED THAT HE NO LONGER

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:08.556
HAD DOOR AND REFUSED TO SAY

01:37:08.622 --> 01:37:09.423
WHERE HE BOUGHT. THIS IS THE

01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:10.858
START OF AN AWFUL EMOTIONAL

01:37:10.925 --> 01:37:12.092
ROLLER COASTER TO NAVIGATE WITH

01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:13.594
MY CHILDREN AS THEY STILL HOPE

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:15.296
TO THIS DAY. THAT THE TRAINER

01:37:15.362 --> 01:37:17.398
WILL TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:19.166
FULLER. I DO NOT WISH ANY FAMILY

01:37:19.233 --> 01:37:20.701
TO GO THROUGH THIS HORRIBLE

01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:21.368
EXPERIENCE. SO MY HOPE IS THAT

01:37:21.435 --> 01:37:23.404
WE CAN HELP PUT AN END TO THESE

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:24.405
NOW INTENDED AND MALICIOUS DOG

WE NEVER WOULD HAVE WORKED WITH

01:37:35.549 --> 01:37:37.618

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:38.252
REQUIREMENTS FAMILIES WHO NEED

01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:40.554

FOR REFORM ON MANY OF ITS

FUNCTIONS. AND THIS BILL IS

01:56:32.118 --> 01:56:35.121
SEPARATE FROM ANY OF THAT. WE'RE

01:56:35.188 --> 01:56:37.490
NOT TALKING HERE ABOUT. WHETHER

01:56:37.557 --> 01:56:39.325
THE BOARD DOES A GOOD JOB OR

01:56:39.392 --> 01:56:41.394
DOESN'T DO A GOOD JOB OR HAS THE

01:56:41.461 --> 01:56:43.162
AUTHORITY OR DOESN'T HAVE THE

01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:46.399
AUTHORITY. WHAT THIS IS ABOUT

01:56:46.466 --> 01:56:53.973
IS- THE CALL TO ALL. IS TO- MAKE

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:57.143
SURE THAT THERE IS. MORE

01:56:57.210 --> 01:57:00.413
CONFIDENCE IN THE BOARD AND SO

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.781
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS ASKING

01:57:01.848 --> 01:57:05.651
THAT THE- BOARD EITHER AT B.

01:57:05.718 --> 01:57:08.121
RIGHT NOW IT CAN HAVE AN EVEN

01:57:08.187 --> 01:57:10.623
BALANCE BETWEEN LATE PEOPLE AND

01:57:10.690 --> 01:57:14.327
MEDICAL PEOPLE. OR IT CAN HAVE

01:57:14.394 --> 01:57:16.262
ONE ADDITIONAL MEDICAL PERSON

01:57:16.329 --> 01:57:17.797
THIS WOULD MAKE IT SOUTHERLY THE

01:57:17.864 --> 01:57:21.033
BNP EVEN BALANCE OR THERE WILL

01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:22.969
BE ONE PERSON ONE MORE LAKEPORT.

01:57:23.035 --> 01:57:26.105
AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT.

01:57:26.172 --> 01:57:29.842
CONSUMERS AND ADVOCATES CAN FEEL

01:57:29.909 --> 01:57:32.412

HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE-

02:12:02.981 --> 02:12:04.816
I WILL SAY THAT THAT WITH

02:12:04.883 --> 02:12:06.952
RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL-

02:12:07.019 --> 02:12:08.587
THE PURPOSE IS NOT TO CHANGE THE

02:12:08.654 --> 02:12:11.023
OUTCOME- NECESSARILY IT IS TO

02:12:11.089 --> 02:12:13.325
RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE BOARD

02:12:13.392 --> 02:12:16.728
AND ITS PROFIT. SO YOU'RE SAYING

02:12:16.795 --> 02:12:18.664
THAT CHANGING THE COMPOSITION

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:20.666
ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE WHAT

02:12:20.732 --> 02:12:23.001
HAPPENS WITH THE BOARD WITH THE

02:12:23.068 --> 02:12:24.136
OUTCOME OF THE BOARD IT IS WITH

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:26.271
THE VOTES WILL BE ARE THE

02:12:26.338 --> 02:12:28.440
PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO

02:12:28.507 --> 02:12:29.408
CHANGE THE OUTCOMES OF THE

02:12:29.474 --> 02:12:30.475
BOARD'S DECISION OF COURSE

02:12:30.542 --> 02:12:31.810
ADDING ADDITIONAL PUBLIC MEMBER

02:12:31.877 --> 02:12:33.078
VOICE WHICH COULD CHANGE THE

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:35.314
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD- AND

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:36.214
EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS

02:12:36.281 --> 02:12:37.716
BRING THEIR OWN YOU KNOW

02:12:37.783 --> 02:12:39.551
PERSPECTIVES- TO THOSE PANEL

02:12:39.618 --> 02:12:41.653
DECISIONS BUT WE DON'T AT THE

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:43.355
PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO

02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:45.357
CHANGE THE OUTCOME. OF THE BOARD

02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:46.525
NECESSARILY IF TO RESTORE

02:12:46.591 --> 02:12:48.060
CONFIDENCE IN THE BOARD. ROOM

02:12:48.126 --> 02:12:53.231
OKAY SO EVEN WITH THE CHANGE THE

02:12:53.298 --> 02:12:55.167
WHAT THE ISSUES WERE STILL

02:12:55.233 --> 02:12:58.770
POTENTIALLY BE THERE. IT'S

02:12:58.837 --> 02:13:01.173
POSSIBLE OKAY- SO THE L. A.

02:13:01.239 --> 02:13:03.208
TIMES NOTED- ONE OF THE OTHER

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:05.811
ISSUES IS THAT THERE IS A DELAY-

02:13:05.877 --> 02:13:07.479
SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THEIR

02:13:07.546 --> 02:13:09.381
RESPONSE TO COMPLAINT DO WE

02:13:09.448 --> 02:13:11.683
ANTICIPATE THAT THE CHANGE IN

02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:12.818
THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARDS

02:13:12.884 --> 02:13:13.352
WILL IMPROVE THAT. I DON'T

02:13:13.418 --> 02:13:18.423
BELIEVE THAT TO BE. I'M YOU KNOW

02:13:18.490 --> 02:13:20.892
THE BOARD OR BOARDS HAVE MANY

02:13:20.959 --> 02:13:22.627
ROLES OUTSIDE OF JESS A

02:13:22.694 --> 02:13:25.497
DISCIPLINARY ACTION SO THE

02:13:25.564 --> 02:13:26.965
MEDICAL BOARD IS ALSO IN CHARGE

02:13:27.032 --> 02:13:29.334
OF APPROVING UNDERGRADUATE AND

02:13:29.401 --> 02:13:30.202
GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION

02:13:30.268 --> 02:13:31.870
PROGRAMS APPROVING CLINICAL

02:13:31.937 --> 02:13:33.538
CLERKSHIPS AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS

02:13:33.605 --> 02:13:35.273
AND HOSPITALS ADMINISTERING THE

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.775
BOARD'S CONTINUING MEDICAL

02:13:36.842 --> 02:13:40.112
EDUCATION PROGRAM RCM MEANS I'M

02:13:40.178 --> 02:13:41.847
AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY

02:13:41.913 --> 02:13:43.982
MOST BOARDS ARE COMPOSED OF

02:13:44.049 --> 02:13:45.384
THOSE THAT ARE ACTUALLY IN THE

02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:47.085
PROFESSION NOT JUST THE

02:13:47.152 --> 02:13:49.054
DISCIPLINARY THING BUT THE OTHER

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:52.023
ASPECTS OF THE BOARD ITSELF- AND

02:13:52.090 --> 02:13:54.025
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE NOTION

02:13:54.092 --> 02:13:56.228
AND I GUESS THAT'S IS NOT WHAT

02:13:56.294 --> 02:13:57.796
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT

02:13:57.863 --> 02:14:00.098
PHYSICIANS- WOULD SEIZE. A AND

02:14:00.165 --> 02:14:02.734
AN ACT- AND NOT DO SOMETHING

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:05.203
ABOUT IT OR THAT THAT WE DON'T

02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:07.406
RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN A PATIENT IS

02:14:07.472 --> 02:14:09.307
HARMED IS NOT JUST THE PATIENT

02:14:09.374 --> 02:14:10.442
AS THE FAMILY AS A COMMUNITY BUT

02:14:10.509 --> 02:14:12.177
IT'S ALSO OUR PRACTICE AND THAT

02:14:12.244 --> 02:14:14.813
WE WOULD NOT ACT ON THAT I GUESS

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:15.480
WE'RE NOT STATING THAT THAT IS

02:14:15.547 --> 02:14:19.718
THE CASE- IT'S JUST FOR PUBLIC

02:14:19.785 --> 02:14:21.386
PERCEPTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:14:21.453 --> 02:14:22.687
WOULD BE A VERY MEANINGFUL STEP

02:14:22.754 --> 02:14:23.722
IN RESTORING THE PUBLIC'S

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:25.323
CONFIDENCE IN THE BOARD THE

02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:27.192
BOARD HAS FACED. INCREASING

02:14:27.259 --> 02:14:28.760
SCRUTINY AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW

02:14:28.827 --> 02:14:30.762
OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS

02:14:30.829 --> 02:14:32.764
CERTAINLY. OVER THE COURSE OF

02:14:32.831 --> 02:14:34.266
THE SIX YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN ON

02:14:34.332 --> 02:14:36.401
THIS BOARD- AND WE DO BELIEVE

02:14:36.468 --> 02:14:37.869
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY AGREES IN

02:14:37.936 --> 02:14:39.805
FACT ALL OF ITS POSITION MEMBERS

02:14:39.871 --> 02:14:41.740
ALL OF ITS PUBLIC MEMBERS. AGREE

02:14:41.807 --> 02:14:44.209
THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT STAFF-

02:14:44.276 --> 02:14:46.545
FOR THE PUBLIC. BUT IT WOULD NOT

02:14:46.611 --> 02:14:47.879
NECESSARILY CHANGE THE OTHER

02:14:47.946 --> 02:14:49.614
THINGS THAT THE PUBLIC IS

02:14:49.681 --> 02:14:50.449
LOOKING FOR WHICH IS AN

02:14:50.515 --> 02:14:52.250
IMPROVEMENT IN THE TIME OF

02:14:52.317 --> 02:14:54.019
DEALING WITH THE COMPLAINTS OR

02:14:54.085 --> 02:14:56.021
AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE TYPES OF

02:14:56.087 --> 02:14:58.390
DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. THAT THAT

02:14:58.457 --> 02:15:00.091
THAT THE PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN

02:15:00.158 --> 02:15:02.727
HARMED. FEEL SHOULD BE DONE

02:15:02.794 --> 02:15:04.396
THAT'S CORRECT THIS THIS

02:15:04.463 --> 02:15:06.865
LEGISLATION IS AT ONE OF A

02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:09.267
NUMBER OF MEASURES- THAT WE

02:15:09.334 --> 02:15:12.270
BELIEVE- WOULD BE IMPORTANT IF

02:15:12.337 --> 02:15:14.539
YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO BOTH. TO

02:15:14.606 --> 02:15:15.540
REDUCE THOSE TIMES MAKE

02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:17.008
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BOARD ARE

02:15:17.075 --> 02:15:19.277
THOSE ARE ALL INCLUDED IN THE

02:15:19.344 --> 02:15:20.278
MEMO THAT WE DISTRIBUTED TO THE

02:15:20.345 --> 02:15:21.746
LEGISLATURE I IN JANUARY OF THIS

02:15:21.813 --> 02:15:23.014
YEAR. OKAYBUT THIS BILL DOESN'T

02:15:23.081 --> 02:15:25.050
DO THAT DOESN'T DO IT ON ITS OWN

02:15:25.116 --> 02:15:26.618
RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:15:26.685 --> 02:15:28.019
PART OF THAT PACKAGE RIGHT OKAY

02:15:28.086 --> 02:15:30.422
ALL RIGHT. I'M WELL THANK YOU

02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:31.323
FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD I DO

02:15:31.389 --> 02:15:33.525
THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER

02:15:33.592 --> 02:15:34.392
BILLS THAT DO SPECIFICALLY

02:15:34.459 --> 02:15:37.262
ADDRESS CERTAIN ISSUES- ONE OF

02:15:37.329 --> 02:15:39.264
WHICH WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY

02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:40.365
WHICH DEALT WITH. YOU KNOW

02:15:40.432 --> 02:15:41.032
PHYSICIANS THAT SEXUALLY ASSAULT

02:15:41.099 --> 02:15:42.234
PATIENTS YOU KNOW NOT GETTING

02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:44.302
THEIR LICENSURE BACK- I DO THINK

02:15:44.369 --> 02:15:45.804
THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO RESTORE

02:15:45.871 --> 02:15:47.205
CONFIDENCE BUT I THINK THAT THE

02:15:47.272 --> 02:15:49.241
WAY IN WHICH WE RESTORE

02:15:49.307 --> 02:15:49.908
CONFIDENCE. IS ACTUALLY MAKING

02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:51.710
SURE THAT THOSE PHYSICIANS WHO

02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:54.312
SHOULD NOT BE PRACTICING ARE NOT

02:15:54.379 --> 02:15:55.780
PRACTICING AND THAT WE ARE-

02:15:55.847 --> 02:15:57.415
RESPONDING. PLANTS AT THE

02:15:57.482 --> 02:15:59.017
FASHION IN A CHANGING THE

02:15:59.084 --> 02:16:00.452
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD ISN'T

02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:02.020
GOING TO DO THAT THEN I'M NOT

02:16:02.087 --> 02:16:04.389
SURE THAT. IT'S THE BEST OUT BUT

02:16:04.456 --> 02:16:06.024
I DO APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING

02:16:06.091 --> 02:16:10.128
THIS AND ANSWER MY QUESTIONS

02:16:10.195 --> 02:16:11.396
THANK YOU. THANK DR WEBER. ANY

02:16:11.463 --> 02:16:14.900
ADDITIONAL. IMMENSE SEEING NINE

02:16:14.966 --> 02:16:16.401
THIRTY WORK WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:16:16.468 --> 02:16:20.205
CLOSE SURE BOB. AS MY WITNESS

02:16:20.272 --> 02:16:22.774
HERE SAID THERE'S A WHOLE PACK

02:16:22.841 --> 02:16:24.943
AND DR WEBER'S BILL WILL BE AN

02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:27.112
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT- AND I

02:16:27.178 --> 02:16:29.748
PARTICULARLY RESPECT DR WEBER AS

02:16:29.814 --> 02:16:33.018
A PHYSICIAN AND DOCTOR ARAMBULA

02:16:33.084 --> 02:16:36.121
WHO'S ALSO ON THIS- COMMITTEE.

02:16:36.187 --> 02:16:38.323
AND YOU KNOW I CAN ONLY DO SO

02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:40.225
MUCH WITH THIS BILL IT WILL NOT

02:16:40.292 --> 02:16:43.395
CURE EVERYTHING IT DOES IF THERE

02:16:43.461 --> 02:16:45.864
IF THERE WERE. A BIG

02:16:45.931 --> 02:16:47.999
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE MEDICAL

02:16:48.066 --> 02:16:52.304
FOLKS AND V- LAKE PEOPLE ON THE

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:54.873
BOARD. THE MEDICAL FOLKS WON'T

02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:57.108
BE ABLE TO OUT VOTE THE LAY

02:16:57.175 --> 02:17:01.146
PEOPLE. THAT'S TRUE HOW OFTEN

02:17:01.212 --> 02:17:03.315
THAT HAPPENS I DON'T KNOW- I

02:17:03.381 --> 02:17:05.383
THINK AGAIN THERE ARE MANY OTHER

02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:07.452
BILLS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

02:17:07.519 --> 02:17:09.788
TO SOLVING THIS. THIS DOES

02:17:09.854 --> 02:17:11.790
GUARANTEE THAT YOU JUST CAN'T

02:17:11.856 --> 02:17:16.461
HAVE DOCTORS ALONE RAM SOMETHING

02:17:16.528 --> 02:17:17.529
THROUGH THAT THE LATE PEOPLE

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:20.031
DON'T AGREE WITH. SO IN THAT IT

02:17:20.098 --> 02:17:22.601
DOES DO SOMETHING. ARE IT

02:17:22.667 --> 02:17:24.669
DOESN'T DO AS MUCH AS YOU'RE

02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:26.204
DOING AND THERE ARE A WHOLE

02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:27.973
BUNCH OF BILLS THEY'RE GOING TO

02:17:28.039 --> 02:17:30.909
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND I WANNA

02:17:30.976 --> 02:17:33.845
SAY THIS. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT

02:17:33.912 --> 02:17:36.681
THE MEDICAL BOARD. REALIZES

02:17:36.748 --> 02:17:38.416
THERE ARE PROBLEMS AND WANTS TO

02:17:38.483 --> 02:17:41.119
SOLVE THEM AND THIS IS JUST. ONE

02:17:41.186 --> 02:17:42.921
OF MANY BILLS PERHAPS NOT THE

02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:44.689
MOST IMPORTANT AND THAT'S FINE.

02:17:44.756 --> 02:17:47.025
BUT I DO THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT

02:17:47.092 --> 02:17:49.794
BECAUSE IT DOES SHOW YOU CAN'T

02:17:49.861 --> 02:17:53.665
HAVE DOCTORS OVERWHELMINGLY P.

02:17:53.732 --> 02:17:55.700
THANK YOU DR COURT. SOME

02:17:55.767 --> 02:17:57.002
ELEMENTS ARE BY SAYING I

02:17:57.068 --> 02:17:58.370
APPRECIATE THE MEDICAL BOARD'S

02:17:58.436 --> 02:18:00.005
EFFORTS TO BE PROACTIVE ABOUT

02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:00.772
IMPROVING ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH

02:18:00.839 --> 02:18:02.273
THE PUBLIC AND AS WE'VE HEARD

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:04.909
TODAY THERE'S A DEBATE. ABOUT

02:18:04.976 --> 02:18:05.610
WHETHER OR NOT THIS BILL WILL

02:18:05.677 --> 02:18:07.679
SUBSTANTIVELY CHANGED THE

02:18:07.746 --> 02:18:09.581
DECISION MAKING BY THE BOARD

02:18:09.648 --> 02:18:11.016
HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT

02:18:11.082 --> 02:18:12.684
PERCEPTION IS ALSO IMPORTANT-

02:18:12.751 --> 02:18:14.686
WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING TRUST

02:18:14.753 --> 02:18:16.955
AT THE SAME TIME I URGE YOU TO

02:18:17.022 --> 02:18:17.722
CONTINUE TO CONSIDER THE

02:18:17.789 --> 02:18:18.857
IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING THE

02:18:18.923 --> 02:18:21.026
VOICE OF PHYSICIANS WHEN IT

02:18:21.092 --> 02:18:21.826
COMES TO APPLYING THE STANDARD

02:18:21.893 --> 02:18:24.062
OF CARE- AND I HOPE THAT DEBATE

02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:25.397
CONTINUES AS THE BILL MOVES

02:18:25.463 --> 02:18:27.465
FORWARD. IN THE MEANTIME WITH

02:18:27.532 --> 02:18:28.400
THE AUTHORS ACCEPTANCE OF THE
