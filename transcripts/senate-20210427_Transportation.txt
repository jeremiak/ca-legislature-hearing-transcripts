THESE LOCAL AIR MISSIONS HURT THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED POPULATIONS. REPLACING THESE VEHICLES WITH ZERO EMISSION ALTERNATIVES IS NEEDED TO REDUCE THE HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORSENS CLIMATE CHANGE. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT SOLUTION FOR FINANCING THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES HAS BEEN BELCHER OR GRANT PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO MEET THE DIVERSE FINANCIAL NEEDS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE FLEET OWNERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE PUTS MORE TOOLS. IN THE TOOLBOX TRANSITIONING FLEETS SHOULD BE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND EQUITABLE BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN THE AREAS WITH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DIESEL POLLUTION FOR THE BUSINESS BUSINESS OWNERS WHO MANAGES THESE VEHICLES. THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO GET THE STATE TO THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW WE CAN BEST LEVERAGE. BRING A PRICE CAPITAL INSTANCE WHERE MAKES. AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MAXIMIZE THE ABILITY FOR FLEETS OF ALL SIZES TO TRANSITION TO SERVE AS A MISSION OPTIONS. SB THREE SEVENTY TWO WILL CREATE A ONE STOP SHOP WEBSITE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT ALL THE PUT POTENTIAL FINANCING.

AND ALSO INCENTIVES AND CREATIVE FINANCING TO MAKE SURE THAT TRUCK OWNERS CAN PURCHASE THE NEW CLEANER TRUCKS. EACH TRUCKS WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A LOWER TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP THAN CONVENTIONAL DIESEL FUEL TRUCKS BUT THE INITIAL STICKER PRICE. IS HIGHER FOR THE ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY. WE PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE THE BILL'S INCLUSION OF A 75% FOR OUR MOST UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE MOST BURDENS CURRENTLY BY TRUCKING POLLUTION.

AND KNOWING THE IMPACT THAT THE DIESEL EXHAUST POLLUTION HAS HAD. ON A NUMBER OF MY- LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS THIS IS REALLY NEEDED BECAUSE AS UNFORTUNATELY MORE AND MORE TRACKING IS MOVED TO INDEPENDENT TRUCKERS. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO. TO GET THE EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD PROTECT ALL OF US INCLUDING THEMSELVES SO THIS IS REALLY NEEDED BILL REALLY APPRECIATE THE- SENATOR BRING IT FORWARD. AND VERY VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT AND AS I INDICATED I WILLMOVE IT WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER SENATOR MCCASKEY YEAH THANK YOU MA'AM. TWITTER I. ONCE AGAIN I FEEL LIKE A BROKEN RECORD. LIKE TO REPEAT THE COMMITTEE INTO FOLKS THAT. ONE DIESEL TRUCK REMOVED ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA HAS THE SAME CLIMATE AFFECTED SAID AS A DIESEL TRUCK REMOVED IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY THEY'VE FROM A CLIMATE POINT OF VIEW AND CARBON IT'S THE SAME. FROM THE MISSIONS AND- POLLUTION PROBLEM- I GET THE BIT I'M FOCUSING IN ON. ONE APPLAUD THE- CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE- COSTS MOVING INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT BACK PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES ON THAT RISK MANAGEMENT HAS ELEMENTS THAT WILL ACTUALLY GET FOLKS IN. I'M FOCUSING ON SORT OF. THE WOODEN ELEMENT OF HAVING 75% OF THE FINANCING PRODUCTS FOR THESE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY MISSIONS WHICH WERE STILL OUT MAKING ARE. LIKE TO BELIEVE MISSIONS BUT IS THAT I. I GUESS THE QUESTION TO THE AUTHORS SAID. HERE WE- A TRUCKER WHO HAS FOR. SHE DELIVERS FISH TO THE FOR CLIENTS. RIGHT NOW EVERY EVERY SHOP HAS 25% SO THREE OF THEM ARE LOCATED BY THE PORT AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY'S DISTRICT ONE OF THEM IS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. PEOPLE START EATING MORE FISH OUTSIDE THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY AND THAT NUMBER BECOME 73% OR 71% OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS BUT IT DOESN'T. FIT THIS WOODEN. FIGURE FOR FINANCING PRODUCTS EVEN THOUGH WITH MAKE A- OBSERVATION THAT OBVIOUSLY MOST OF THESE AREAS AFFECTED BY THE POLLUTION THE DIESEL POLLUTION OR THE CARBON IS AT. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE 75% BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN THIS AND THINGS AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MY FISH TRUCKER THAT IS NOW NO LONGER WANTS TO DO THE PROGRAM BUT CAN'T CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN THESE FINANCIAL- OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE THE QUESTION IS WHY 75% YEAH. WOULD YOU LIKE IT TO BE A 100% 50% WHAT IS YOUR NUMBER NO I WHICH I WOULD SAY IT AGAIN YOU YOU WANT TO WE CAN CONVERT THE LIGHT DUTY TRUCKS SO WE'RE GOING INTO THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS WE WANT TO MAKE THESE. THESE AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY WHO'S WHO IT NEEDS TO FINANCING I THINK THESE ARE ALL GOOD FINANCIAL TOOLS BUT WE GET A CUT OUT PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY 455% OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER THAT THAT THEY- THEY WANT TO. JUMP IN ON THIS THE BILL ABILITY UP BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT THE BANKS HAVE ALREADY TOLD THEM YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE NOT. YOU FINANCE NOT ELIGIBLE THEY HAVE NO PLACE TO GO IF THEY DON'T MEET THE 75% THRESHOLD I GET. I GET THE PUBLIC POLICY GOAL BUT IT'S- IT'S WOODEN AND IT DOESN'T ALLOW. FOR FIFTY ONE FOR SIXTY TWO OR SIXTY EIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE WOULD SAY CLEARLY THIS PERSON IS SERVING AND- OPERATES IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY BUT- THAT. THRESHOLD FOR THESE FINANCIAL TOOLS IS SO HARD AND THEY CAN'T EVEN GROW THEIR BUSINESS. OUTSIDE THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY WOULD GET KNOCKED OUT SO THAT'S- I'M NOT. I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THE BILL I'M JUST. SO CENTER RIGHT HEALTHCARE I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP THIS HAS NOT BEEN TRIED BEFORE NO ONE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE WE RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM YOU'VE GOT THE AMAZONS OF THE WORLD. WHO EVERYBODY THINKS IS SO AMAZING BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO HAVE A ZERO EMISSION. VEHICLES BUT THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE MONEY THAN GOD. SO THIS IS A WAY FOR US TO TRY AND HELP THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY. HEAVY DUTY SIZE TRUCKS IF THIS PROGRAM WORKS THE IC IS EXPANDING THAT. AND YOUR PERSON SELLING THE FISH WE HOPE SHE CAN GET 275% BUT IF NOT IN THE FUTURE. WE CANNOT WE CAN EITHER DO ANOTHER BILL THIS IS THE FIRST FORAY INTO THIS AREA. A LOT OF ALWAYS DEPENDS ON THE FISH EATING PUBLIC THAT IS CORRECT. THANK YOU SENATOR. AKOWSKI SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND AUTHOR- PAID UNDER. I GUESS WHAT MISTER WHITE HOUSE USED TO SAY BUT AS THE OTHER STATED THIS IS THE FIRST STEP I JUST REALLY DO APPRECIATE.

DID SHE AND I AND OTHERS IN THIS ROOM REPRESENT AREAS THAT ARE HEAVILY IMPACT BY FREIGHT. TRAFFIC AND CONGESTION. AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP PARTICULARLY AS THE SHIPPING AND WAREHOUSING INDUSTRIES UNDERGO A REVOLUTION- AND A FUNDAMENTAL PARADIGM SHIFT. AND THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF BUILDING WELL OVER A MILLION SQUARE FEET OF WAREHOUSING SPACE. IN COMMUNITIES THAT WILL SOON BE IMPACTED SO. I DO COMMEND THE AUTHOR I THINK THIS IS A VERY VERY SMART. EMILY SENSIBLE FIRST STEP ON ON A MOVING THIS TECHNOLOGY INTO COMMUNITIES. AND CHANNELS WHERE IT'S NEEDED I WOULD ASK TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN SENATOR BAKER.

THANK YOU CENTER BAKER THANK YOU I THINK I SEE NO OTHER MIKES- I'M SORRY SENATOR MEN. I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO- I THINK AT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL IT'S A THOUGHTFUL BILL- IF WE'RE GONNA TRY TO REDUCE. CARBON EMISSIONS. TRANSPORTATION PRETTY GOOD WITH THESE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY. VEHICLES IS GOT TO BE A PLACE WHERE WE START. AND I THINK THIS IS A GREAT DEAL BECAUSE YOU KNOW TOO OFTEN WHEN WE THINK OF. REGULATORY POLICIES IN THIS AREA WE'RE LOOKING AT STICKS AND WE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WE HAVE CARROTS TO GO WITH THAT- TO HELP. FACILITATE THE ABILITY OF ACTORS TO MEET THESE. AMBITIOUS GOALS THAT WE'RE SETTING IN CALIFORNIA SO I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR AND WOOD. ALSO TO BE A CO AUTHOR AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU CENTERMAN WITHOUT HAVING TO. GRAY A SCENE OTHER. UP I DON'T BELIEVE SO OKAY I WILL ALSO MENTION THAT. I BELIEVE THERE ABOUT SEVEN FIFTEEN OR SO STATE PROGRAMS THAT. ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY. THIS WOULD ALSO BE ONE WAY TO HELP NAVIGATE. ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND SORT OF DEMYSTIFY A LOT OF THE STUFF. I WANT ALSO TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO GREAT BILL. SENATOR LEAVE AND YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF CO AUTHORS NOW SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THE CENTRE GONZALEZ YES I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS AND THE QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU TO OUR NEW CO AUTHORS. MEMBERS WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THE SENATE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT UNFUNDED MANDATE WAS. I QUICKLY LEARNED WHAT THAT WAS SO I HAVE TRIED MOVING FORWARD TO ALWAYS TO CREATE LEGISLATION. THAT FOR ASKING SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING WE PROVIDE THE MONEY AS WELL. THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE ANOTHER TOOL IN THE STATE'S TOOLBOX WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSITIONING TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. WE NOTE THAT IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BUT WE CAN'T ALWAYS JUST PUT THE BURDEN ON THE TRUCK OWNERS. SO THIS IS A WAY TO HELP THEM AND AS THE CHAIR- WISELY SAID THIS IS A WAY TO BRING EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND MAKE IT A ONE STOP SHOP FOR THESE TRUCKERS. SO MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE.

SEVEN TEN HOMES OWNED BY CALTRANS FIRST I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH YOUR STAFF WORK DILIGENTLY WITH- MY STAFF SO THANK YOU FOR THE- SPIRIT OF COOPERATION IN THE HARD WORK. SB THREE ONE LOOKS TO MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY VIABLE FOR THE CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA TO PURCHASES OF SUBSTANTIALLY REHABILITATE MAINTAIN AND ADMINISTER IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS WHICH WILL HELP TO ADDRESS LOCAL HOUSING CRISIS. IT IS ALSO BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE SR SEVEN TEN FREEWAY GAP BETWEEN- HAMMERED PASADENA CAN NO LONGER BE BUILT OBVIOUSLY SO SOUTH PASADENA HAS EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO THE CURRENT SALES PROCESS THESE CHANGES WILL ALLOW FOR MORE DIRECT INTERVENTION BY CITIES IN PURCHASING THE PROPERTIES IT WILL GIVE TENANTS. A SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI FAMILY UNITS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE AND GIVES CALTRANS. A NINE MONTH TIME LINE TO SELL. WELL ARE NOT OTHER OFFER ON A- PROPERTIES TO THE CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA AT ACQUISITION PRICE. WITH A FIFTY FIVE YEAR COVENANT ON THE LAND WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN AFFORDABILITY. TO ALLOW THE CITY PASADENA TO ESTABLISH AND TRANSFER OWNERSHIP TO A CITY APPROVED NONPROFIT HOUSINGRELATED ENTITY THAT WOULD ACT AS A STEWARD OVER THE PORTFOLIO- SB THREE EIGHTY ONE HIS- A BILL THAT'S ONLY BEEN SIX DECADES IN THE MAKING. AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK IN GOOD FAITH WITH ALL PARTIES I THINK ONE OF THE KEY PIECES. IS THE CURRENT TENANTS. RIGHT NOW HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE.

SOUTH PASADENA HAS DELIVERED DECADES OF BLIGHT AND TRACTORS NUISANCE WHILE CALTRAIN CHASES AND EVER PROMPTING ME TO REJECT DECADES OF VARIOUS SAFETY AND RESPECT CONSEQUENCES OF ITS LOCAL ACTED PROPERTIES SOME OF WHICH ARE HISTORIC. MANY OF THE SIXTY EIGHT HOMES THAT REMAIN OWNED BY CALTRANS IN MY CITY ARE VACANT AND IN THE STATE OF EXTREME DISREPAIR INDEED THE STATUS NOW PAYING A SECURITY FIRM TO GUARD THE TAKING HOMES FROM FURTHER DAMAGE FOR ILLEGAL OCCUPATION. MOREOVER FOR DECADES SOUTH PASADENA SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF PROPERTY TAX PROCEEDS FROM THESE TERMS AS A SMALL CITY WITH NO MAJOR COMMERCIAL. PROPERTY TAXES ARE MY CITY'S PRIMARY SOURCE OF REVENUE SHOULD THE COMMUNITY DESIRES THAT CALTRANS REMOVED ITSELF FROM THE HOUSING BUSINESS AND ALLOW SOUTH PASADENA TO EXPEDITIOUSLY INITIATE LOCAL CONTROL AND DETERMINE THE FAVORABLE DISPOSITION STRATEGY FOR THE HOMES.

ACCESS WHAT THE WAS THERE'S ORIGINALLY. NO I ACTUALLY. I DON'T KNOW- I DON'T THINK SO I MEAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON IS THERE'S BEEN TENANTS THAT HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THERE FOR THREE DECADES SO WE'VE BEEN PUT MOSTLY FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT THAT EXISTING TENANTS DON'T GET THIS PLACE TO HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN GOOD STANDING IN THE PURCHASE THE HOMES THAT THEY'VE BEEN RENTING FOR DECADES.

I CAN TELL YOU IT IS INCREDIBLY HOT OUT THERE AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO STAND IN LINE. OVER THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE SEEN DRIVERS LICENSES EXTENDED ONLINE PRIMARILY DUE TO PANDEMIC. THESE EXTENSIONS ARE ALSO GRANTED HOWEVER BECAUSE THE DMB SYSTEMS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF HANDLING THE TREMENDOUS INFLUX OF PEOPLE WHO NEEDED TO OBTAIN A REAL ID. REGISTER THEIR VEHICLE- OR TRANSFER TITLES. THE PROBLEMS THAT PLAGUE DID DMB ARE NOT NEW. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN AN AUDIT OF THE DMV THE LONG WAIT TIMES IN BOTCHED VOTER REGISTRATION AND THREE YEARS LATER WE ARE STILL IN THE SAME SPOT.

AND IT WOULD PROTECT THE DMB FROM FURTHER- EXPOSURE TO VIRUSES AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC TO VIRUSES THEY'VE DONE THIS SUCCESSFULLY NEW YORK THEY'VE DONE IT SUCCESSFULLY IN ARIZONA AND NEW YORK CERTAINLY HAS THE TRAFFIC PROBLEMS THAT WE DO I THINK WE COULD DO THIS WITHOUT- WITHOUT ANY WITHOUT ANY HURT TO THEIR LOCAL TRAFFIC- I AM.

YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT THE DISCUSSION HERE- CENTER MELENDEZ CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS I THINK MANY OF US DO- REGARDING THE DMV HOWEVER. WE HAVE AN IMPENDING DEADLINE OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOR REAL ID ON TOP OF THE PANDEMIC SO. I THINK THAT OVERHAULING RIGHT NOW MAY BE. A TOUGH TIME FOR US TO DO THAT IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT IT DID IT IN THE ORIGINAL FORM THAT YOU HAD CREATED ON THE BLL LANGUAGE. IT DID CREATE A TWO TIER SYSTEM SO I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU BE AMENABLE SHOULD THIS PASS- FOR THAT. AND LASTLY THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. PROBLEMS THERE TOO IT'S ON THE PATH OF A NEGATIVE BALANCE UNFORTUNATELY. SO THIS WOULD JUST FURTHER EXACERBATE YOU KNOW THE LACK OF FUNDING IN THAT. SO WITH THAT I WILL BE OPPOSED TODAY BUT WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU OVERALL- TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOMEWHERE. LATER ON. WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM OTHER SENATORS. CASEY NINE SENATOR MELENDEZ WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AT WHAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I JUST. WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS- SINCE THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL- IN THE ANALYSIS IT. TALKS ABOUT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A FINANCIAL IMPACT TO THE NBA BUT IT IS UNKNOWN- PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THE FEE. IS SET TO COVERED THE SERVICES RENDERED SO IF YOU PER YOU ARE PROVIDING. LESS OF THAT SERVICE THAN THE COST TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE ALSO DECREASESSO THERE'S NOT. ANY DECREASE- OF FUNDING. NECESSARILY TO THAT ACCOUNT BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU WOULD BE PROVIDING THE SERVICES OUT AS OFTEN I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT- IN THE ANALYSIS THAT TALKS ABOUT- THIS C. H. P. FUNDING. PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THE FUNDING FOR CHP COMES FROM THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE NOT FROM YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE FEE. AT ALL- HI YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS AND WE'VE PASSED A LOT OF POLICY HERE DESIGNED TO HELP CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO- KIND OF COME BACK INTO THE ECONOMY AND REGAIN SOME OF WHAT THEY'VE LOST OVER THE PAST YEAR. AND I'VE SUPPORTED THERE'S ACTIONS AND BUT I THINK WE CAN GO FURTHER AND HELPING PEOPLE IN THE LONG TERM BY TAKING A SMALL STEP OF ALLOWING THEM TO RENEW TEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE AFTER EIGHT YEARS LIKE MANY OTHER STATES DO RATHER THAN JUST FIVE YEARS THAT IS NOT- IT'S NOT A BURDEN TO THE STATE'S BUDGET IN DOING SO. I THINK CALIFORNIANS WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THE DMB WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE IT MEANS FEWER PEOPLE COMING IN FOR SERVICES WHICH MEANS THEY CAN THEN DIRECT THEIR ATTENTION TO THOSE WHO NEED TO GET THEIR REAL ID WE NEED TO GET A NEW LICENSE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER SERVICES THAT THE DMB PROVIDES- SO WITH THAT MANAGER I WOULD- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. IN CASE. MELINDA. DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON SB. FOUR EIGHTY SIX REVERSION BY SENATOR DOLLY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CONSULTING CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON AS BEFORE EIGHTY SIX.

YEAH GOOD MORNING CHAIRED IN MEMBERS I'M HERE BEFORE TODAY TO PRESENT SB FIVE EIGHT THREE WHICH BUILDS ON CALIFORNIA'S NEW MOTOR VOTER SYSTEM IN RECENT COMPLIANCE UPGRADES RESULTING FROM A MANDATORY TRANSITION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S REAL ID SYSTEM TO STREAMLINE NEW REGISTRATIONS AND REGISTRATION UPDATES OF STATE AGENCIES. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SB FIVE EIGHT THREE AN UNREGISTERED ELIGIBLE DAHLE WHO IS VERIFIED AS A CITIZEN DURING AN AGENCY TRANSACTION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY ADDED TO VOTER. NAME DETAILS UPDATED BASED ON INFORMATION PROVIDED DURING A TYPICAL AGENCY TRANSACTION TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK SB FIVE EIGHTY THREE ADULTS WHAT IS CALLED A BACKEND AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION SYSTEM KNOWN COMMONLY AS A VR AT THE DMV AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO BE AUTHORIZED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE UNDER THIS LEGISLATION IN A BACK IN AB OUR SYSTEM A VOTING AGE PERSON WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE BUT NOT CURRENTLY REGISTERED AND WHO PROVIDES PROOF OF US CITIZENSHIP DURING THEIR DMP TRANSACTION. WOULD HAVE THEIR INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY PASSED ON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO BE ADDED TO THE VOTER ROLLS THE PERSON WOULD NOT NEED TO REQUEST REGISTRATION OR INTEREST CITIZENSHIP QUESTION DURING THE DMV TRANSACTION INSTEAD THE CITIZENSHIP DOCUMENTS THEY PRESENT AS PART OF THE APPLICABLE DMV TRANSACTIONS PROVIDE THE NECESSARY AT A STATION OF CITIZENSHIP AND REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY TO PROTECT NON CITIZENS THE BACK AND IF YOUR SERVICES SYSTEM SCREENS OUT DMV CUSTOMERS FOR APPLICANTS FOR AN AB SIXTY. WHICH IS USED BY UNDER AND OR WHO PROVIDED DOCUMENTS ESTABLISHING FORMS SUCH AS A GREEN CARD UNDER THE BACK IN AB ARE SO PROVIDE FOR BY- JUST BE FIVE EIGHT THREE A PURSE WHO BRIDGE PROOF OF IT WOULD HAVE THEIR INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY TRANSMITTED SECTOR STATE FOR INCLUSION N THE VOTER ROLLS ONCE THE SECULAR STATE REGISTERS AN ELIGIBLE DMV CUSTOMER THE COUNTY REGISTER OF VOTERS WITHIN MAIL THE NEWLY REGISTERED VOTERS A NOTICE OF REGISTRATION AS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW. IN THIS MAIL NOTICE WOULD PROVIDE THE PERSON A CHANCE TO DECLINE REGISTRATION BY RELYING ON VERIFY DOCUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE COURSE OF THE DMV TRANSACTION BACK IN AB YOUR WILL REDUCE HUMAN ERROR SIGNIFICANTLY WHILE ALSO MINIMIZING THE LIKELIHOOD OF UNINTENTIONALLY FALSE CLAIMS OF CITIZENSHIP BY APPLICANTS THIS APPROACH TO VOTER REGISTRATIONS ALREADY BEING USED EFFECTIVELY IN OTHER STATES COLORADO AND OREGON USED BACK AND IF YOU'RE SYSTEMS IN ALASKA MASSACHUSETTS AND NEVADA HAVE RECENTLY AUTHORIZED SIMILAR PROCEDURES. EVIDENCE FROM THE STATE SO FAR SHOWS THAT BACK AND IF YOUR WORKS DATA FROM COLORADO. INDICATES THAT LOW S. THAN 1% OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS WHO EACH MAY TO CLIMB REGISTRY. SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE OF L. SERVICE WHO ARE. TO VOTE UNDER THIS ONLY ELLA STUDENTS WHO WITH. CHIU NOT TO BE REGISTER AS VOTERS. WILL OPT OUT. BY CA. LARGE NUMBERS ILLEGAL CITIZENS ARE BUSY.

BACK IN AB ARE ALSO PROVIDES ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT INCLUDE COST SAVINGS STREAMLINED DMV TRANSACTIONS IMPROVED ALREADY CAPABILITY BY MAXIMIZING AUTOMATION. AND MAKING RIGHTS RESTORATION EFFECTIVE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED.

BY RELYING ON INFORMATION THAT IS ALREADY BEING PRESENTED VERIFIED AND RECORDED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF AN AG TRANSACTION. CALIFORNIA CAN CREATE MORE ACCURATE AND COMPLETE VOTER ROLLS REDUCE HUMAN ERROR AND MAXIMIZE SAFEGUARDS FOR NONCITIZENS INTERACTING WITH THESE AGENCIES.

THE MANAGER MEMBERS AS WE JUST HEARD A BILL. THAT DIDN'T GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE OR STILL ON CALL NANA BOATS THAT REQUIRE THE DMV TO ACTUALLY DO LESS WORK.

WHEN I GOT HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE AND HE ACTUALLY GOT A BALLOT I. HE SAID I CAN VOTE FOR YOU AND YOU SIXTEEN SO THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH. OUR I. T.

WHERE WE HAVE HUGE PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE THE LEADER. IN THE NATION WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY COMING OUT OF OUR STATE. ON THE PRIVATE SIDE OF FOR SOME REASON WE SURE CAN'T SEEING HOW TO.

VICE CHAIR BATES DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION AS WELL. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE OKAY GO RIGHT AHEAD JUST A COMMENT I WANT TO THINK OF. SENATOR ANA. NEWSOME NEWMAN. NEWMAN FINANCIALLY TODAY. I FOR. A THE ISSUE OF OPTING OUT IN OPTING IN I HAD TO- A COUPLE YEARS AGO I THINK I WAS TWENTY SEVENTEEN TRYING TO DETERMINE A WAY TO. PROVIDE AN OPT OUT. OF ICON ON THE SCREEN SHOT THAT YOU HAVE A DMV BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE- PROBLEMS THAT THAT- EMANATED FROM THE ROLL OUT OF FIVE THE MOTOR VOTER- I. ACTUALLY HAD SOME- INTERESTED IN MAKING IT MORE OF A- OF A FIX AT TO DMB AND SECRETARY OF STATE RATHER THAN LEGISLATION SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE A FURTHER DISCUSSION. WITH US SENATOR- AND I MENTIONED THAT TO HIM SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT I WAS PROPOSING. AND HOW THAT MIGHT BE FOLDED AND THROUGH SOME AMENDMENT PROCESS ON THIS ONE BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT THIS SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE COMPLICATED KNOWING THAT DMB HAS HAD PROBLEMS. WITH OF THEIR OB TECHNICAL. CONNECTION TO SECRETARY OF STATE BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH A DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE. WHO ARE REGISTERED TO- INACCURATELY THEY WOULD BE WHETHER BE IN THE OTHER PARTY AND I THINK MANY OF OUR OFFICES WERE INUNDATED INITIALLY. ARE WITH SOME OF THE ERRORS THAT OCCURRED SO. I THINK IT'S GOOD TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT AND I INTEND TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. VICE CHAIR BATES SENATOR ARCHULETA. YES THANK YOU AND CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO. CONGRATULATIONS THE AUTHOR WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT- TO EVERYONE. THE FACT IS THAT WE NOW CAN ALL- GET PEOPLE TO VOTE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS THERE. IN IS ALWAYS THE OPTION. IN WITH THIS BILL AS THEY REGISTER FOR THE ROOM THEIR LICENSE AND SO ON THE INFORMATION IS TAKEN. AND THEN IT AS IT GOES THROUGH THE SYSTEM AT THE VERY END. THE PERSON IS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTION TO DO THAT. AND WITH THIS WE'RE HOPING THAT- BEFORE FOUR SIX MILLION PEOPLE THAT. PERHAPS WILL VOTE NOT VOTE WHATEVER WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO VOTE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE BILL I'D LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR. I THINK IT IT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT WE ALWAYS WANT EVERYONE TO BE GIVEN THAT OPTION TO VOTE AND- WHAT A GREAT WAY TO DO IT. AND WITH THAT I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATE ARCHULETA SENATOR MEN. I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF CENTER. AND APPLIED MY COLLEAGUE FROM ULLERTON FOR PUSHING THIS BILL AT A TIME WHEN. I TOO MANY STATE LEGISLATURES AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO SUPPRESS VOTER PARTICIPATION. I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE AS CONTINUE TO LEAD IN THIS COUNTRY- AND YOU KNOW EMPHASIZE THE VERY FIRST PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY WHICH IS VOTER PARTICIPATION. AND SO- I WOULD ALSO ASK YOU MADE A CO AUTHOR AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY I SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS A THOUGHTFUL BILL- AND IT'S IT REPRESENTS THE VALUES THAT MADE THIS COUNTRY WHAT IT IS. THANK YOU SENATOR MEN. ARE RIGHT SEE NO OTHER MIKES UP SENATOR NEWMAN I ALSO WANNA COOK COMMEND YOU FOR BY DOING THIS BILL- CERTAINLY WILL EXPAND VOTER ACCESS AS WE ALL HAVE MENTIONED- I JUST WANNA CLARIFY THAT YOU WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS.

AND THANK YOU TO CENTER BASIS UNDER DOLLARS FOR YOUR YOURTHOUGHTFUL COMMENTS AS WELL. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT BUT ON THE ONE HAND- CENTER BATES GLAD TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION- BUT TO SENATOR DOLLY YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN- IN ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS SYSTEM IS USED TO TAKE. HUMAN ERROR OUT OF THE EQUATION I THINK THE SITUATION YOU DESCRIBE MANY OF US HAVEHEARD- WITH- MISTAKES IN THE NAME OVER AND OVER MOTOR VOTER PROCESS.

SIX SENATE BILL SIX FOUR THREE TASS THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND CONSULTANT- CONSULTATION WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO CREATE A WORKING GROUP. TASKED WITH PREPARING AN ASSESSMENT OF THE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC- FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE AND FUEL PRODUCTION NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS BUSES AND OFF ROAD VEHICLES. BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED ON PAGE FOR THE ANALYSIS. THESE AMENDMENTS WILL BROADEN THIS ASSESSMENT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE PROCESS FOR CREATING HYDROGEN AS WELL AS TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE ASSESSMENT. TO LOOK AT OTHER TRADITIONALLY HARD TO ELECTRIFY SECTORS LIKE LOCOMOTIVES MARITIME AND AVIATION. IN CALIFORNIA THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS THE LEAD AGENCY- IN WHEN IT COMES TO. HI JIM ANALYSIS SHOW ASKED THAT WE AT- COMMISSIONED THEM TO DO THE JOB MOREOVER THE RESEARCH REPORT IS WELL EQUIPPED WITH THE TOOLS AND THE EXPERTISE NEEDED TO CONVENE THIS WORKING GROUP AND PREPARE THIS IMPORTANT ASSESSMENT. HOWEVER THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHY IS THIS ASSESSMENT NEEDED. HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS ARE AN IDEAL ALTERNATIVE FUEL SOLUTION TO ELECTRIFIED MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY COMMERCIAL VEHICLES. AND THESE VEHICLES ARE NECESSARY COMPONENT TO ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY. A QUALITY GOALS HOWEVER THERE EXISTS A KNOWLEDGE GAP REGARDING THE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS REQUIRED FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET ITS CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS. STATE AGENCIES ENERGY UTILITIES AND YOU AND THE LEGISLATOR LACKS SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE AMOUNT OF HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE HYDROGEN FUEL PRODUCTION NEEDED TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN AIR GOALS. THIS BILL SENATE BILL SIX FORTY THREE WILL HELP BRIDGE THE KNOWLEDGE GAP AND ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO ADEQUATELY PLAN AND IMPLEMENT HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS AS AN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCE. THE ASSESSMENT REQUIRED IN THIS BILL WILL FOCUS ON PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE DISPENSING AND DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT. STORAGE EQUIPMENT SUPPORTING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY CENTER ZHEJIANG ACROSS HYDROGEN SECTORS THROUGH THE EXAMPLE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRODUCTION STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION. FINALLY TO ENSURE TIMELY AND CURRENT DATA THE WORKING GROUP IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE ASSESSMENT BY DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WITH THE INFORMATION FROM THE ASSESSMENT CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. ABOUT OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. ONCE AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS I THINK THEY WILL. MAKE THIS BILL A MUCH BETTER BILL THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED NO NO VOTES AND BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND FOR THIS REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

I'M HOPING THAT- THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS ARE TAKING HERE TODAY I WHICH I MEAN EXCEPT- ALL THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS YOU SEE THEM ON THAT PAGE FOR YOUR ANALYSIS- HOPEFULLY SETTLE SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND- THE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY OF THIS FRAMEWORK AND SOME OF THE ONGOING DEBATES I KNOW THAT. WE'RE HAVING IS THE SENATE RIGHT NOW- IN TERMS OF THE VIABILITY THE VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES IN TURKEY IN TERMS OF ACHIEVING ZERO EMISSIONS TRANSPORTATION FUTURE. AND MAKING CLEAR THAT- THIS LEGISLATION- AND THE AUTHORITY THAT WE WOULD ESTABLISH IN THIS LEGISLATION. WOULD ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR INTER IMPLEMENTING OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT TWENTY THIRTY FIVE SEVEN GOAL- YEAH FROM- FROM TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT'S A STANDARD THAT INCLUDES BOTH HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES AS WELL AS- ELECTRIC VEHICLES. BUT THE THRUST OF THIS LEGISLATION IS REALLY DIFFICULT GAP AROUND ELECTRIC VEHICLE- INFRASTRUCTURE- DEVELOPING STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS GAPS THAT CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE A CENTRAL AUTHORITY WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE SENIOR LEADERSHIP AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE'S. HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE INVESTING. BILLIONS IF NOT TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS- IN THIS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE VEHICLES AND- OTHER RELATED WORK AT THE NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO REALIZE. FUTURE THAT GOES BEYOND THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE AT THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IT'S ARE PRETTY CRIME IT'S IN IS THIS STATE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A MEETING LEGISLATION AND LEGISLATORS AND- YOU KNOW- INCREDIBLE PRESERVATION OF HABITAT. IN CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS BUT THE FACT. IS WE ARE THE LARGEST WORLDS LOOK TROLLING AND CAN. BESIDES THE U. AND SHE- WORDS IF THEY'RE NOT JUST NAY HONOR. TROLLING CONSUMPTION WITH THE AMOUNT.

YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE A MAKER WE'RE NOT JUST- A TAKER IN THE STATE WHEN IT COMES ELECTRIC VEHICLES I THINK WE CAN DO ALL THE WAY FROM THE LIVE GAME ITSELF. ALL THE WAY TO THE VEHICLE IN TERMS OF MANUFACTURING AND JOB CREATION SO WE GOT BIG POTENTIAL HERE FOR TRANSCENDING CHANGE THAT TO ME WILL ACTUALLY SOLVE. THE MIDDLE CLASSES ENERGY TRAP NOT JUST SOLVE. POLLUTION PROBLEMS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES LIVING ON THE FRONT LINES AND NOT JUST- DEPLOYED TEST LIST FOR- FOLKS WHO CAN AFFORD THEM RIGHT NOW BUT IT ACTUALLY SOLVES. THE BIGGEST EXPENSE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS BUDGET IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS NOT FOOD AND NOT HEALTH CARE IT'S THEIR TRANSPORTATION.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN- WITH THE VERY SINCERE APPRECIATION TO CHAIR GONZALEZ AND COMMITTEE STAFFER THERE IS STILL SYSTEMS WITH EVERY ASPECT OF THIS- COMPLEX TRANSPORTATION ISSUE ARE THE ANALYSIS THEIR RESPONSES TO BOTH THE OPPOSITION AND SUPPORT QUITE RESPECTFUL AND QUITE THOROUGH SO THANK YOU SO MUCH BECAUSE IT IS A IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT PATH. I BEGIN WITH A QUICK BACKGROUND LEADING UP TO MY INTRODUCTION OF SB SEVEN SIXTY WHICH WOULD DELETE THE ALIGNMENT OF SR TWO FORTY ONE TOLL ROAD SOUTH OF WILL ALSO PARKWAY ON MARCH TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY THE TCA BOARDS OF DIRECTORS DECIDED NOT TO PURSUE WITH EXTENDING THE APOSTATE ROUTE TO FORTY ONE TOLL ROAD FROM ITS CURRENT TERM ENOUGH IT ALSO PARKWAY WHICH IS AN EAST WEST ARTERIAL EXTENDING THROUGH AND BEYOND THE EASTERN BOUNDARY OF THE CITY OF MISSION VIEJO. INSTEAD THE BOARD'S ACTION IN RESPONSE TO TECHNICAL STUDIES AND PUBLIC OPPOSITION APPROVED MOVING FORWARD WITH AN UNTOLD EXTENSION OF LOS PETRONE. IS PARKWAY ARTERIAL. THE TCP RELEASE HERALDED THIS DECISION AND I CALLED TO SEE CHAIRWOMAN AND MAYOR OF THE CITY OF IRVINE. AFTER A ROBUST FOR YEARS OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT EFFORT WE'RE HAPPY WE HAVE A SOLUTION THAT REPRESENTS BOTH COMMUNITY INPUT AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS. THE LAST PETRONIO'S PARKWAY EXTENSION WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REGIONAL MOBILITY IMPROVEMENT. IN OUR APPROVAL MEANS THAT ALL OTHER ALTERNATIVES INCLUDING ALL ROUTES. THAT CONNECT DIRECTLY TO INTERSTATE FIVE ARE REMOVED FROM CONSIDERATION AND THIS CONCLUDES TCA'S EFFORTS TO EXTEND THE TWO FORTY ONE TOLL ROAD. THIS STATEMENT SHOULD HAVE SET THE TONE FOR A NEW ROBUSTUM COLLABORATIVE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING PROCESS FOR ALL GOING FORWARD. HOWEVER THE SUBSEQUENT PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY SOME BOARD MEMBERS BEGAN TO ERODE PUBLIC TRUST. OF BY INDICATING THERE COULD BE A RENEWED EFFORT TO REVIVE THE STUDIED ALTERNATIVES THAT WOULD EXTEND THE TWO FORTY ONE TO INTERSTATE FIVE THROUGH SAN CLEMENTE IS PROTECTED OPEN SPACE. RATHER THAN CONNECTING THE TWO FORTY ONE TO I. FIVE SOUTH. OF THE CITY OF SAN CLEMENTE AS CURRENTLY SET FORTH IN THE CALIFORNIA STREETS AND HIGHWAYS CODE SECTION FIVE FOUR ONE. CENT COMMITTEE SOUGHT ASSURANCES OVER TIME THAT THE TCA'S MARCH TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY DECISION WAS IN FACT THE FINAL WORD ON THE ISSUE. HOWEVER THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED AND AT THE CITY'S REQUEST I WAS PROMPTED TO INTRODUCE SB SEVEN SIXTY LEGISLATION WHICH AS I SAID SEEKS TO MEMORIALIZE TCA'S MARCH TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY DECISION. BY DELETING THE ALIGNMENT FSR TWO FORTY ONE SOUTH OF ALSO PARKWAY IT IS DUPLICATIVE OF S. B. THIRTEEN SEVENTY THREE WHICH I INTRODUCED LAST YEAR. WAS APPROVED BY THE SENATE BUT NEVER A CHEN DICE IN ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION. DUE TO THE CALL VIA THE BILL LIMITATION. MY GOAL WITH THIS LEGISLATION MEMORIALIZING TO SEIZE MARCH DECISION IS TWO FOLD ONE REESTABLISH THE TRUST THAT WAS INHERENT WHEN THAT DECISION WAS MADE AND SECONDLY. ENCOURAGE ALL INVOLVED THE TCA THE- CTA ABOUT THE TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR AGENCIES THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND THE REGION'S CITIESTO BEGIN AGAIN. THE COLLABORATIVE AND ROBUST DISCUSSION ON TRAFFIC CONGESTION RELIEF SOLUTIONS I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT AS A RESULT. OF THIS BILL TCA CHAIRMAN PEGGY WONG AND DISTRICT FIVE SOUTH COUNTY SUPERVISOR LISA BARTLETT HAD TAKEN THE LEAD AND CONVENE A WORKING GROUP DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE JUST BEGUN. AND PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES TO FIND CONSENSUS SOLUTIONS AND ELIMINATE THE YEARS LONG CONTROVERSY THAT HAS PERSISTED AND CONTRIBUTED TO PREVENTING SOME PLANNED PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD. HERE JUST BECAUSE LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN SIXTY ARE KATHY WARD MAYOR SAM FOR MANY. IN THE ON MARKET PRAYER. ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN CLEMENTE. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR BATES- WILL START WITH MARK HUGHES HERE IN THE GALLERY GO RIGHT AHEAD MARK THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU MY NAME IS MARK OF PRIOR I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN CLEMENTE. THE EXTENSION OF THE TWO FORTY RUN- TOLL ROAD WAS DROPPED BY UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE TCA BOARD ON MARCH TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY. SB SEVEN SIXTY AFFIRMS OF THAT DECISION. THE IRONY OF THE TCA'S OPPOSITION TO SEVEN SIXTY NOW. IS THAT THE DENTURE THE FOOTHILL EASTERN BORDER THE TCA CRISTINA CHEZ ANTI CA CEO SAMUEL JOHNSON. URGED CENTER BASE O AMEND LAST YEAR'S SENATE BILL THIRTEEN SEVENTY THREE. WITH A LANGUAGE CURRENTLY IN SEVEN SIXTY ONLY TO HAVE THE TCA BOARD WEEKS LATER VOTE TO OPPOSE THE MEASURE. UNFORTUNATELY THE TCA HAS A WELL EARNED REPUTATION FOR PROPOSING TOLL ROADS THROUGH ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS. AND NOT KEEPING THEIR COMMITMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE THE TCA FIRST PROPOSED A TOLL ROAD THROUGH THE SAN ONOFRE STATE PARK. THAT PROPOSED TOLL ROAD ENDED IN A LEGAL SETTLEMENT. WHEREBY THE TCA WILL PAY TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE RESTORATION OF A WATERSHED NEAR CAMP PENDLETON. BUT ONLY IF THE TCA COMPLETES AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE FOR THE TWO FORTY ONE EXTENSION. THIS AGREEMENT HAS LED TO A PERVERSE OUTCOME WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION MONEY MAY ONLY GET PAID IF THE TCA IS ABLE TO DESTROY OPEN SPACE. AND CONSERVATION. EASEMENTS IN SAN CLEMENTE. THIS YEAR ON A NINETEENTH TCA PROPOSED A NEW PLANNING POLICY. WHICH RE OPENED THE PROSPECT OF EXTENDING THE TWO FORTY ONE. JUST A YEAR AFTER DROPPED THAT OPTION. T. C. A. CLAIM THAT IT WAS A PRODUCT OF A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. BUT CTA IN ORANGECOUNTY RESPONDED THE TCA MADE NO REQUEST FOR INPUT FROM THEM. SAN CLEMENTE AGREES WITH- CTA CEO DURRELL'S JOHNSON IN HIS LETTER TO THE TCA. WORRY SAID THE PROPOSED POLICY WORKS CONTRARY TO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THE CONCERNS THAT LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF SB SEVEN SIXTY. AS THE TCA TESTIFIED LAST YEAR BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. THE TCA'S MARCH TWELVE DECISION TO ABANDON THE TWO FORTY ONE TOLL ROAD AND SUPPORT THE EXTENSION OF THE LOST PATROL IS PARKWAY. WILL ENSURE NEEDED TRAFFIC RELIEF UNTIL TWENTY FIFTY. IN CONCLUSION IF DOWN THE ROAD THERE IS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THE CITY OF SAN CLEMENTE. AS IT DID IN SUPPORTING THE LOST PETRONIUS PARKWAY EXTENSION WHICH WILL RUN THROUGH SAN CLEMENTE WILL STEP UP TO DO ITS FAIR SHARE. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB SEVEN SIXTY TO KEEP THE DEAL AT ALL PARTIES AGREE TO LAST YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR FRYE F. ATIONS THERE AS WELL- SENATOR BATES DID YOU HAVE ONE OTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT I ONLY HAVE DOCUMENTED ONE THE STAFF FIVE COUNTY WARD MAYOR SAN CLEMENTE OKAY.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATHY WARD MAYOR OF SAN CLEMENTE ON BEHALF OF THE RESIDENTS OF SAN CLEMENTE I WANT TO THANK SENATOR BATES FOR HER CONTINUING EFFORTS TO FIND A SOLUTION. TO THE TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES FACING ORANGE COUNTY AND EXPRESS OUR FULL SUPPORT FOR SB SEVEN SIXTY. ON MARCH TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY THE TCA BOARD UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO CONCLUDE THE AGENCY'S EFFORTS. TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS FOR SOUTHERNLY EXTENSION AT THE STATE ROUTE TO FORTY ONE TOTAL ROAD AND INSTEAD DECIDED TO SUPPORT EXTENDING THE LOCAL CHARMS PARKWAY AND TWO OTHER TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. SUBSEQUENTLY CALTRANS THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. AND THE TCA COLLECTIVELY AGREED. LAST YEAR SENATOR BATES INTRODUCED SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY THREE TO CODIFY THAT DECISION AND THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND THE FULL SENATE VOTED TO APPROVE THAT BILL. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO CONVERT NINETEEN SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY THREE WAS NOT SET FOR HEARING BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. SENATOR BATES INTRODUCED AN IDENTICAL BILL IN SB SEVEN SIXTY. JUST LAST WEEK THE TCA PROPOSED THE POLICY TO CONTEMPLATE A FUTURE SOUTHERN EXTENSION OF THEIR TOLL ROAD. THAT CLEARLY INDICATES THAT TCS CONSIDERING BACKING AWAY FROM THEIR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO VOTE AND THE SUBSEQUENT AGREEMENT BY CALTRANS AND OF THE TA. TCA IS NOT A TRUSTED PARTNER- CPAC E. O. DALE JOHNSON STATED LAST WEEK IN A LETTER TO THE TCA THAT THE PROPOSED POLICY WORKS AGAINST RESOLVING THE CONCERNS THAT LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF SB SEVEN SIXTY. AS STATED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR LISA BARTLETT HAS CONVENED A WORKING GROUP TO DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT BETWEEN ALL PARTIES. SB SEVEN SIXTY PROVIDED A CATALYST FOR THOSE EFFORTS AND WE ASK LIKE YOU DID LST YEAR THAT YOU PROVIDE CENTER BATES THE TOOLS NEEDED TO BRING THESE DISCUSSIONS TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION.

AND LET'S SEE WHO WE HAVE AS LATE OPPOSITION HERE WE HAVE NEEDS ALL OF. TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR AGENCY THE TCA AS WELL AS DAN SILVER AND INJURED HABITATS LEAGUE A MODERATOR CAN YOU ENSURE THAT A MISTRESS ALL OF HIS ON THE LINE. THE FINAL SIDE THEY GO AHEAD- INEXORABLE ME AFTER THE TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR AGENCIES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. WERE OPPOSED TO SB SEVEN SIXTY THIS BILL IS ABOUT ONE CITY IN ORANGE COUNTY TRYING TO PERMANENTLY BLOCK FUTURE ROAD CONSTRUCTION NEARLY EVERY OTHER CITY IN THE REGION AS OPPOSED TO THE BILL BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING REQUIRES REGIONAL COOPERATION. AS OPPOSED BY ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS BECAUSE IT IMPACTS THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE AND THREATENS PLANNED FOR OPEN SPACE FUNDING AS OPPOSED BY LABOR BECAUSE OF BLOCKS FEATURE JOBS AND IT'S OPPOSED BY LOCAL BUSINESS AND TRANSPORTATION GROUPS BECAUSE WILL PREVENT TRAFFIC SOLUTIONS. THE QUESTION BEFORE YOU WITH THIS WILL YOU PICK ONE CITY ABOVE ALL THE OTHER CITIES IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY AND ALLOW SAN CLEMENTE'S TOOK FOREVER BALK ROAD CONSTRUCTION AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE WELL RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THE DISPUTE TURNED INTO A TWO YEAR BATTLE SO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE REGION CAN CONTINUE WORKING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO CREATE A LOCAL SOLUTION. IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATE TO STEP INTO A LOCAL. TRANSPORTATION PLANNING ISSUE. THAT'S NOT GOOD POLICY ALLOW IN. CITIES TO CAL. AND OTHER. AGENTS FROM THE- FUTURE OPTION. ESPECIALLY WHEN THOUSANDS OF NEW HOMES WILL BE BUILT ALONG THIS CORRIDOR THE COMING YEARS. THERE'S ALSO PENDING LITIGATION FROM THE CITY OF SAN CLEMENTE TRYING TO BLOCK FUTURE ROADS IN THE COLLECTION OF REVENUE TO PAY FOR WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN BUILT. THIS BILL COULD IMPACT EXISTING AND FUTURE LITIGATION. THE BILL SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN SO THAT THE LOCAL CITIES AND TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES CAN WORK OUT A SOLUTION. WELL STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE FOR WEEKS TO TRY AN INTERESTING COMMENTARIES CONCERN AND EVERYONE IN THE REGION IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THOSE MEETINGS SO EVERYTHING CAN BE REACHED. ON BEHALF OF ALL THE OPPOSITION GROUPS INCLUDING LABOR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS BUSINESS GROUPS CITIES WITHIN ORANGE COUNTY AND TRANSPORTATION GROUPS WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE OF THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU MR SOLA.

GOOD DAY CHOI GONZALEZ AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND YOU HEARD I'M SILVERBIRD ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN CAPS IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION AS MEMBERS OF THE STATE SENATE OPERATE COALITION WE OPPOSE SB SEVEN SIXTY. WE DO NOT SEE A LEGITIMATE PURPOSE FOR THE BILL AT THIS TIME AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS OF FIGHTING TO SAVE SEVEN NO. EACH ONE SIGNED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE TEACHING DAY DESIGNATING AN ENVIRONMENTAL ACCEPTABLE AREA FOR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS CALTRANS AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY SIGNED THE RELATED PROTECTIVE AGREEMENT. IF YOU SEE A THAT IMPLEMENTED A LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS BASED ON THE REGION'S FUTURE TRANSPORTATION NEEDS AND ASSESS THE COR RANGE OF ALTERNATIVES THE RESULT WAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE TO BUILD THE MOST FRONTRUNNERS PARKWAY EXTENSION. THIS PROJECT IS NOT MOVING FORWARD. THIS CHOICE WAS PER BY THE SIGNATURE CLEMENTE. IT TRAFFIC IN BAR EXCEPT MAN KONCZ WITH THE AGREEMENTS. AND ACTING AB FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX LAST YEAR LEGISLATURE CODIFIED PORTIONS OF THESE AGREEMENTS PROTECTING THE STATE BEACH AND OTHER WILDLIFE AREAS. P. C. A. HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT ITS LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS WORKS AND ACCEPTABLE SOLUTIONS CAN BE FOUND CAN YOU BELIEVE IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE TO ENABLE THESE LOCAL PLANNING EFFORTS INCLUDING AN ONGOING STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. TO ADOPT PREMATURE LEGISLATION THAT COULD INTERFERE WITH THE TICE'S ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS TRANSPORTATION PLANS AND IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ITSELF. WE ARE AS WE DO NOT FIND A REASON WHY THE BILL WAS NEED. YOUR NAME COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OTHERS THROUGH THE ONGOING LOCAL PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SILVER OKAY WE'VE CONCLUDED.

ANYMORE IN THE QUEUE. FOR OPPOSITION ONE LAST TIME. THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN THE OPPOSITION TO THANK YOU MODERATOR GREAT WE'VE CONCLUDED SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WE'LL TAKE THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS. I SEE SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I APOLOGIZE FOR SPEAKING ON THIS SINCE I KNOW WERE ALL LATE FOR LUNCH- BUT THIS DOES AFFECT MY DISTRICT- I'VE BEEN LATE COMING TO A POSITION ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE I WANTED TO DO MY RESEARCH AND- HEAR OUT ALL THE DIFFERENT PLAYERS AND I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SOME GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR- AND I APPRECIATE THAT. RESPECTFULLY I DO NEED TO OPPOSE THIS BILL IN STRONG OPPOSITION I'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS OF SAN CLEMENTE RESIDENTS AND I APPRECIATE THOSE. THE FATE OF THE TWO FORTY ONE IS NOT SOLELY ABOUT ONE CITY OR EVEN ONE SENATE-DISTRICT. IT'S A REGIONAL ISSUE THAT IMPACTS ALL OF ORANGE COUNTY. BUT ESPECIALLY CITIES LIKE LAGUNA HILLS. LISA VIEJO RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA MISSION VIEJO IRVINE TUSTIN. ANAHEIM HILLS IN VILLA PARK AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM MANY OF THE LEADERS OF THOSE REGIONS AND CITIES. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. MY DISTRICT HAS AN ESPECIALLY STRONG STAKE IN WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE TWO FORTY ONE CENSUS WILL HAVE POTENTIALLY A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR CONGESTION AND TRAFFIC GOING FORWARD. NOW THIS IS WHY THE DISCUSSIONS OVER THE TWO FORTY ONE HAVE INVOLVED NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING NOT ONLY TCA BUT ALSO THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY IN CALTRANS. WITH SIGNIFICANT INPUTS FROM LOCAL CITIES AND THE REPRESENTATIVES INCLUDING SAN CLEMENTE. THIS MULTI YEAR MULTI STAKEHOLDER APPROACH LED AN AGREEMENT MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TO END AND FOR ITS TO EXPAND TO EXPAND THE TWO FORTY ONE INSTEAD FOCUS ON THREE PROJECTS TO ALLEVIATE TRAFFIC. IN THE NEAR TERM. LAST WEEK'S PCA UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED A RESOLUTION ENDING ALL EFFORTS TO EXTEND THE TWO FORTY ONE UNLESS CERTAIN BURKE BENCHMARKS WERE MET. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ONLY REASON THIS RESOLUTION HAS NOT BEEN MORE FORMALIZED IS BECAUSE SAN CLEMENTE WANTED MORE PROTECTIONS. AND THESE ARE BEING ADOPTED INTO THE RESOLUTION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HERE THAT WE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM PRIORITIES. LOOKING AT THE MAP OF TWO FORTY ONE IF YOU WANNA PULL THAT UP ON YOUR PHONE YOU CAN SEE IT ENDS ABRUPTLY RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE COULD CAUSE IN MISSION VIEJO. THE IDEA WAS ALWAYS TO HAVE THE TWO FORTY ONE CONNECTED TO FIVE AND THAT'S WHY THE CALIFORNIA CODE IS WRITTEN THE WAY IT IS. IN THE SHORT RUN I BECOME CONVINCED BY CENTER BATES AND REPRESENTATIVES MET SAN CLEMENTE. THAT A TWO FORTY ONE EXTENSION OF THE FIVE IS NOT NECESSARY- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT ALL PARTIES AGREE UPON. BUT THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THE CASE IN THE LONG RUN WE JUST DON'T KNOW. OVER THE LONG RUN HAVING THE TWO FORTY ONE TO THE FIVE MAY BE. SEEN AS DESIRABLE OR NECESSARY FOR REDUCING CONGESTION. IMPROVING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND FACILITATING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY IN THE REGION INCLUDING MANY KEY CITIES IN MY DISTRICT. IT MAY WELL BE THE CASE THAN FIVE YEARS AND TEN YEARS IN FIFTEEN YEARS WE DECIDED WE VERY WELL NEED THIS EXPANSION. NOW IT'S BEEN SAID THAT THIS BILL CODIFIES THE AGREEMENT BUT IT ACTUALLY GOES MUCH FURTHER THAN THAT IF PERMANENTLY ENDS THE POSSIBILITY TO TWO FORTY ONE EXTENSION. TAKING AWAY AN OPTION THAT I THINK ALL OF OUR REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITIES IN CITIES. RECOGNIZE COULD BE AN IMPORTANT ROUTE IN THE FUTURE FOR EASING CONGESTION. WE IN THE LEGISLATURE WIELD AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF POWER AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE USE THAT POWER. PARTICULARLY WHEN IT'S TO WEIGH IN ON A LOCAL ISSUE. THERE ARE SEVERAL PRINCIPLES AT WORK THAT CAUSED ME TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. FIRST WE EITHER WE HAVE THE PRINCIPLE OF LOCAL CONTROL. THERE IS A LOCAL PROCESS IN PLACE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY THE WITNESSES. AND ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULTS THERE ARE NO PLANS RIGHT NOW. EXTENDED 2401% COMMITTEE OR ANYONE ANYWHERE ELSE. SECOND THIS BILL IS NOT NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM IS TRYING TO SOLVE AND POTENTIALLY CREATES LONG RUN PROBLEMS. IF THE GOAL IS TO PREVENT A SHORT TERM EXPANSION OF THE AT TWO FORTY ONE THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY. BUT BY ENDING A TWO FORTY ONE IT DESTROYS THE FLEXIBILITY OF REGIONAL ACTORS TO ADDRESS TRANSIT ISSUES GOING FORWARD. THIRD THIS BILL IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR AS IT FAVORS THE INTERESTS OF ONE DISTRICT. INDEED ONE CITY. OVER THE INTERESTS OF OTHER LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS. THE TWO FORTY ONE ISSUES I MENTION IS NOT JUST THE SAN CLEMENTE ISSUE IT'S A REGIONAL ISSUE. THIS BILL PRIORITIZES THE INTERESTS OF ONE CITIES ONE CITY OVER THE INTERESTS OF MANY OTHERS. I THINK THE LIST OF SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION MAKES THIS VERY CLEAR THE SUPPORTERS ARE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY BASED OUT OF SAN CLEMENTE. WHERE IS THE OPPOSITION COMES FROM ACROSS ORANGE COUNTY INCLUDES ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS. LABOR UNIONS CAN BUSINESS COUNCIL. LEADERS FROM A WIDE ARRAY OF CITIES INCLUDING IRVINE ANAHEIM TUSTIN ORANGE YORBA LINDA MISSION VIEJO RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA. AND OTHER PLACES. BY LISA VIEJO AS AS MENTIONED BY THE MAYOR TIFFANY ACKLEY JUST VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO OPPOSE SB SEVEN SIXTEEN THEY SENT A LETTER TO THIS BODY. AND I'D LIKE PERMISSION FROM MADDEN CHAIR TO READ A SHORT EXCERPT FROM THAT. ABSOLUTELY GO RIGHT AHEAD SENATOR MEANT. THE LETTER STATES IN PART. THE PROCESS TO DEFINE MOBILITY SOLUTIONS WITH THE SUCCESS WHICH IS WHY LEGISLATION IS UNNECESSARY. AND MAY UNDERMINE THE GOODWILL AND TRUST THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AS A RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS. THIS MULTI AGENCY THAT SOLUTION DEMONSTRATES THAT LOCAL ISSUES CAN BEST BE RESOLVED BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND IGNORING THIS REGIONAL APPROACH COULD SET A BAD PRECEDENT THAT WOULD ALLOW SMALL SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS TO HALT REGIONALLY BENEFICIAL TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CITY OF SAN CLEMENTE HAS ATTEMPTED TO EXCLUDE THEMSELVES FROM TRANSPORTATION PLANNING PROCESS OVER THE YEARS. IT'S AN AFFRONT TO OUR NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. THIS REGARDING OUR MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR REGIONAL TRAFFIC. THEIR LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE EXHIBITS A COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR THE OTHER CITIES IN THE REGION. THE CITY OF WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE OUR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY. WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORANCE OF BEING PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THE REGION'S TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. AND BELIEVE IT'S INCUMBENT UPON ALL CITIES TO DO THEIR PART. NOW I WILL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT ORANGE COUNTY IS FACING THIS SAME DEBATE. ACROSS A WIDE ARRAY OF ISSUES WHEN THERE COMES TO HOUSING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING HOUSING THE HOMELESS. INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE LIGHT- AND THIS IS AGAIN JUST AN EXAMPLE OF ONE CITY TRYING TO GET ITS WAY OVER. THE INTERESTS AND WELL BEING OF THE REST OF ORANGE COUNTY. SO I'M GONNA POST THIS AND I RESPECTFULLY- YOU KNOW ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THIS SHOULD COME OF OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE CAREFULLY CONSIDER THIS. IF IT COMES TO THE FLOOR THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR MAN SENATOR NEWMAN. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO- I DO APPRECIATE. ALL THOSE OF THE SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED BY SENTIMENT. I DON'T TYPICALLY DO THIS BUT I I'M GOING TO LIVE REALLY SUPPORT THIS BILL TO DAY- AND RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE AS MOVES FORWARD. THE BASE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- THE PARTIES HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO FIND. AB ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES- AND- YOU GIVE ME THAT REASSURANCE AND APPRECIATED MY UNDERSTANDING IS ALSO- THAT TOWARD THAT END THE PARTY SALUTE BLOOD THE LITIGATION PUTTING SINGLE MAN YOU'RE PLANNING A MEETING NEXT WEEK IS THAT STILL CORRECT. AND SO YOU KNOW WITH THAT IN MIND- I'M A SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I WOULD URGE ALL THE PARTIES TO CONTINUE WORKING. ON THIS ISSUE TO FIND AN AMICABLE SOLUTION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I BELIEVE I WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY THAT JUST EXPRESSED ALL HIS CONCERNS AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'M HEARING ABOUT THESE CONCERNS- AND I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS HAVE HEARD ON. I THINK IT WAS THE OPPOSITION THEY WERE STATING THAT THEY WANTED US TO PULL THE BILL TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER AND COME TOGETHER STAKEHOLDERS BUT- BUT- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I THOUGHT. WE HEARD THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND I REMEMBER THOSE COMMENTS WERE THE SAME. YOU KNOW THEY WANTED THE BILL TO BE PULLED SO WE CAN WORK ON IT AND IT'S STILL YOUR LATER SELF. I'M STILL A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED OTHERS NEW INFORMATION THAT JUST. BROUGHT FORWARD BY OUR COLLEAGUE AND SOME OF THE OPPOSITION SO I'M RESPECTFUL OF THAT AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S THIRD DISTRICT BUT FOR ME BECAUSE I. HAD ALREADY GIVEN MY COMMITMENT THAT I WILL ALLOW THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS. I'M GONNA HAVE TO KEEP MY COMMITMENT AND SUPPORT THIS BILL- BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE. AGAIN EVERYONE STILL WORKING ON THIS ISSUE COMING TOGETHER. IT'S BEEN A YEAR AND I WOULD HAVE HOPE THAT THERE WAS PROGRESS ON THE CONVERSATIONS. ARE AT LEAST TRYING TO FIND THAT MIDDLE GROUND BUT- ARE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY I WILL RESERVE. THE RIGHT TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE AND TO ASK THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK AS SHE HAS. VERY DILIGENT NEED TO COME TO A SOLUTION FOR THEIR DISTRICTS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR ALAN. THANK YOU I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- IT IS CLEARLY A THORNY ISSUE OBVIOUSLY A LOCAL ISSUE BUT A LOCAL ISSUE THAT AND- HAS PEOPLE ON ON ON ON EITHER SIDE AND MUCH OF IT DEPENDS ON WHICH PART OF ORANGE COUNTY. QUINCY ONES REPRESENTING- NO I I'VE LAID OFF PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THIS BILL IN THE PAST AND YOU KNOW I. HI I UNDERSTAND THIS IS THIS IS A GOING TO BE NEGOTIATED- I GUESS WHAT I'D LOVE TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE- CARE IN THE COMMITTEE'S. POSITION ON THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD AND IF IT DOES MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY I DO UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR AS AN AYE RECOMMENDATION AYE I WILL SAY. I CENTER MAN IS A IS A FORMIDABLE. ADVOCATE FOR HIS- HIS HIS SIDE OF THE LINE AND FIX THE ANYONE WHO HEARD HIS COMMENTS JUST NOW I THINK CAN'T DENY THAT- YEAH MY TENDENCY IS TO WANT TO YOU KNOW SUPPORT THE CHAIR IN IN AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO COME TO SOME SORT OF. COMMON GROUND- SO AS TO YOUR CHART A PATH MOVING FORWARD IT'S FAIR TO THE COMMUNITIES INVOLVED IN. AND YOU KNOW I DO UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL OPPOSITION IT COMES MORE FROM THE FACT THIS DISRUPTS THE SETTLEMENT. RATHER THAN ANY SORT OF- MERIT AS RELATED RELATING TO THE READING OF THE- OF THE OF TO THE T. FORTY ONE AND SO THE I GUESS WHAT I'D LOVE I'D LOVE TO JUST GET A BETTER SENSE OF. OF MANAGER YOUR PLANS MOVING FORWARD OF THE GUARDS OF THIS BILL AND- JUST TO GIVE ME A SENSE AS I'M AS I'M TRYING TO WIN MY VOTE HERE MY TENDENCY IS ALWAYS TO. WANT TO SUPPORT YOU IN YOUR- EFFORTS TO TRY TO. MEDIATE SOME OF THESE MEETINGS ISSUES HERE BEFORE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN I DON'T THINK I SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF SENATOR BATES I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE TALKED EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE I'VE TALKED TO MANY MEMBERS OF COURSE AN ORANGE COUNTY AS WELL TO GET THERE'S PERSPECTIVE. I'M COMMITTED I KNOW THAT YOU'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS FOR SOME TIME- SO I TRUST THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH EVERYONE AT THE TABLE. WHEN WE SPOKE THE LAST FRIDAY YOU WERE YOU HAD TO MEETINGS AT SET THAT FRIDAY AND I KNOW THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE THIS ON. MY HOPE EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A VERY SUPER LOCAL. ISSUE IS THAT AGAIN THAT THE CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE IN THAT HOPEFULLY SOME TRUST COULD BE BUILT OVER THE NEXT. A FEW MONTHS OR SO. SO WITH THAT THAT'S WHY I AM SUPPORTING TODAY- AND I KNOW THAT SENATOR BATES HAS A LOT OF WORK AHEAD THIS IS CAN. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY IT COULD. CONTINUE TO WORK IN PROGRESS AND SO I KNOW THAT. HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET TO SOME- COMPROMISE HERE SOON SO WITH THAT I WANT TO. ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE IF YOU'D LIKE TO SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE A ROBUST DEBATE. THANK YOU TO THE OPPOSITION FOR LAYING OUT I THINK THE PAST. ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS WE GO FORWARD I AM NOT. A WHOLLY TOTALLY COMMITTED. TO CONTINUING MY WORK WITH THE ODD TO GROUPS AND HOPE THEY BECOME CONGRUENT. AND FIND A CONSENSUS SOLUTION BUT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS. WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL ON THIS ISSUE I WANT YOU TO KNOW IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE ORIGINAL I MEANT THAT. STILL EXISTS THE ANOTHER HIGHWAYS CODE WAS SET. UP THROUGH A STATE PROCESS CALTRANS WAS THE LEAD. ON THE SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY TRAFFIC RELIEF EFFORT THAT WAS TERMINATED. WITH THE SELECTION OF TERMINATING IT ALSO PARKWAY. IN THE MARCH DECISION. FINALLY UP ON THE SAN CLEMENTE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO. THE BUILDING OF THE TOLL ROADS IN ORANGE COUNTY. A TOTAL OF FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST. SEVERAL YEARS WHICH SHOT EXCEEDS MOST A- OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ANY OF THE CITIES. SO THEY HAVE BEEN A PARTNER. IN THE- CONSTRUCTION OF ARTERIALS AND CERTAINLY THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO BE ON. THIS HELPS OUR ROUTE SEVENTY FOUR IS IT. ON A PROCEEDS FROM- NORTH SAN DIEGO ON THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY TO ALSO PARKWAY. SO IT'S BEEN FUN FOR. WE START YOU KNOW I THINK. A OUR NAY. AND MY- HERE. AND I THINK WE ALL OF THAT A TO BRING A COMMUNITY TOGETHER THAT'S WHY I'VE TAKEN. ON A IN A NEW ORDER IN FOR THAT AMOUNT OF TIME% SINCE LAST AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY. TO ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE AND IT IS ONLY BECAUSE I REINTRODUCED A BILL. THAT WE'VE BEGUN TO TALK SO. PLEASE GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP THAT GOING AND I WANT TO KNOW ALL OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE SPOKE. TODAY HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE SO WE MAINTAIN OUR FRIENDSHIP. WEJUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT OF STRONG DISAGREEMENT. IN SOME OF THE AREAS LAW ON THE BILL FINALLY ON- ON OF. THE WEAPON. ISSUES I WANT YOU KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT THE BILL DOES NOT PRECLUDE. THE REGION MOVING FORWARD WITH TRANSPORTATION CONGESTION RELIEF ALTERNATIVES THERE'S WIDE SUPPORT FOR THOSE. ARE THE EXTENSION OF LOS ANGELES PARKWAY THE WIDENING OF STATE ROUTE SEVENTY FOUR. IN THE SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY INTERSTATE FIVE HOV LANE. EXTENSION PROJECT WHICH WILL RELIEVE TRAFFIC IN THAT WHOLE REGION. SOUTH IMPORTANTLY AND MAYBE MORE SO- THE BILL DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE COLLECTION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES. THAT TCA WILL NEED TO MEET ITS FISCAL OBLIGATION TO NOT ONLY THOSE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. BUT TO THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICATION. THAT WILL FOLLOW ARE. AN EXTENSION UP TO FORTY ONE FOR THE ARTERIALS IN THAT SAME REGION. I HAD A LONG DISCUSSION WITH DOWN SILVER WE WORK TOGETHER FOR. EIGHT YEARS. ON THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION PROGRAM. TOGETHER WE WERE ABLE TO SET ASIDE ELEVEN HUNDRED ACRES. OF FREED FROM DEVELOPMENT. IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH MR SILVER. BY HE THOUGHT THE EXTENSION OF THE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES COMPONENT OF THIS BILL. MIGHT BE OF A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT LOT MORE DISCUSSION NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE SO.
