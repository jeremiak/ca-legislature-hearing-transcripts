THANK YOU SO MUCH READING CHAIR I'LL BE VERY BRIEF AND CHAIR AND JUST SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE AT CENTER PORTANTINO FOR- ADVANCING DAYS CRITICAL CLEAN UP THE LEGISLATION. HE MADE A COMMITMENT CENTER PORTANTINO IS A PERSON WHO FOLLOWS THROUGH ON HIS PROMISES THAT TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE RULE EXEMPTION FOCUS ON THE ROLE STARTS TIME THEY'LL START TIME BILL THAT WAS PASSED. LAST YEAR AND IT IS ONE TAKE MOMENT IT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN A PERSON OF YOUR WORD YOU'VE BEEN COLLABORATIVE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY- AND GRATEFUL FOR YOUR FOCUS ON OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND I ALSO. WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRWOMAN CHAIRWOMAN LEYVA. BUT SHE HAS BEEN MORE THAN WILLING TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE ON THE RULE EXEMPTION AS WELL AS ONE AT A RECOGNIZE YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND SAY THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN IMPROVING THE BILL AS WELL SO THANK YOU TO THE TO THE THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU THURMOND TRY UNDERSTANDING WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS CLEAN UP I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS. COUNTIES THAT HAVE MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND. BUT ON THE TAKE SHASTA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THE POPULATION CENTERS MAINLY. THE READING AREA WHERE WE HAVE A HIGH POPULATION BUT THERE. IS A HUNDRED AND- TO MILES AWAY. IS VERY RULED SCHOOL. OUT IN THOSE. OUTLYING PARTS OF THE COUNTIES. IN SO I KNOW. AND I'VE TRIED TO. CLEAN OUT A HERO HOW YOU THAT WOULD WORK I KNOW THAT THERE'S OTHER CRITERIA IS THAT I THINK WILL HELP THOSE RULES SCHOOLS GET WE'RE GOING TO COULD YOU JUST EXPLAIN THAT FOR ME A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR FOR ME I KNOW THAT- THOSE LITTLE SCHOOLS OUT THERE PROBABLY NOT FOLLOWING THIS BILL RIGHT NOW I WANT TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM HOW. HOW IT WOULD AFFECT THEM. SO WE BASICALLY DID. TWO THINGS- THIS STARTING WITH THE COUNTIES OF SEVENTY THOUSAND OR LESS. AND THEN USING THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF RURAL SCHOOL SO THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS FALL IN THAT FEDERAL DEFINITION. FOR THOSE FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND THEY WOULD BE INCLUDED AS WELL SO. YOU NEED TO ASK THEM TO SEE AN- CHATTER MCGUIRE YOU MAY KNOW THERE. THERE'S A THERE'S A LIST OF THOSE DISTRICTS. THAT FALL IN THAT ROLE THAT FEDERAL EXACT. DEFINITION SO- THAT'S WHY WE TRY TO CAPTURE THAT DID IT I DIDN'T FIND THAT IN MY POCKET MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN GET FROM ABSOLUTELY OKAY WE SENT. THROUGH THE CHAIR AFFECTS ALL RIGHT AND UP SLIGHTLY YEAH IT SAYS- WHICH WAS CRITICAL THERE'S THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEFINITIONS WITHIN THE BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR QUALIFICATION. FOR POTENTIAL EXEMPTION. IN WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO BE A WORK WEEK- APPRECIATE- THE AT THE AUTHORS OFFICE OF NOT TAKING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH JUST BASED OFF OF POPULATION- IN SO THERE ARE AND JUST BEING CANDID THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES. THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED RULE THERE UNDER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS. AND NOT ALL SCHOOLS WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE EXEMPTION BUT SOME SCHOOLS LIKE IN A COUNTY A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WOULD BASE OFF OF THE TWO OTHER DEFINITIONS. OF A RURAL DISTRICT. THEN THE BUT WE WERE TRYING TO BE FAIR SO IF YOU ARE TRULY RURAL IN NATURE. WE WANTED TO BE FAIR TO EXEMPT YOU BUT IF YOU'RE A MORE CONCENTRATED AREA THAT JUST HAPPENS TO BE IN A RURAL. COUNTY THEN IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR SO WE TRIED TO USE THE FEDERAL DEFINITION AS A AS A CATCH ALL AS WELL SO WELL I'M ONLY OFF YOUR BILL TODAY AND I WANT TO GET THAT INFORMATION SO I CAN. TAKE A LOOK AT IT BUT I UNDERSTAND TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO HAD WITH THIS APPRECIATED THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR TROUBLED. GOOD MORNING SENATOR PORTANTINO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING. OF THIS CLEAN UP BILL- AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I AM VERY INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE I WASN'T IN THE LEGISLATURE WENT THE PREVIOUSBILL WAS PASSED BUT I HAD TO WORK LOCALLY TO IMPLEMENTED. MY DISTRICT HAD CONCERNS ON THE PREVIOUS BILL AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING- IN THIS- COALITION LETTER THAT I RECEIVED THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL I KNOW THAT IT IS YOUR INTENT TO WORK WITH THESE GROUPS AND TRY TO ENSURE THAT THE DEFINITION THAT YOU'RE CREATING WORKS AND IS FEASIBLE. BUT I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL AT THIS TIME UNTIL I HEAR FROM MY DISTRICT THAT- IT WILL NOT BE DETRIMENTAL TO THEM- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT AND THE ISSUE MOVING FORWARD- WITH. HAVING SAID THAT I JUST- ALL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND WE CAN- WE CAN WORK WITH OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO SEE- THE OPPOSITION THAT WE RECEIVE THE CALL IS FROM MY COUNTY. RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND I DO HAVE ANOTHER LETTER FROM- I THINK THESE ARE FROM- FROM THE SAN MARINO COUNTY THAT HAVE CONCERNS STILL.

THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR YOUR PATIENCE WE ARE NOW MOVING TO SB THREE SIXTY FOUR SENATOR SKINNER PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT SB THREE SIXTY FOUR. IN CALIFORNIA ALL CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF INCOME. OUR ENTITLED TO FREE GRADE SCHOOL FREE EDUCATION K. THROUGH. TWELVE SCHOOL LUNCH AND BREAKFAST IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE SCHOOL DAY ALL OF US KNOW THAT AND THEY ARE LIFELINES FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES HOWEVER. ONLY THOSE CHILDREN WHOSE FAMILIES HAVE FILLED OUT AN APPLICATION AND BEEN VERIFIED ARE FED. INSURED TO BE FED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER MANY MANY OTHER STUDENTS ARE HUNGRY OR NEED A MEAL. AND STUDENTS CAN BE HUNGRY EVEN IF THEY DO NOT MEET INCOME GUIDELINES DEPENDING ON THEIR FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES. MAYBE THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP AT SCHOOL WITH THE- MONEY IN THEIR POCKET THE BY THE SCHOOL MEALS OR A LUNCH PREPARED AT HOME. SO THEIR INABILITY TO HAVE BEEN FED AFFECTS THEIR LEARNING. ALL CHILDREN LEARN BETTER WHEN THEY ARE FED. MANY CHILDREN ARE LEFT OUT IN ADDITION BESIDES THE MAIN THINGS I MENTIONED BECAUSE FAMILIES ARE FREE TO APPLY OR DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY. FOR THEIR FAMILY IS INELIGIBLE BECAUSE FAMILY INCOME ABOVE THE HUNDRED AND 85% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LINE IS STILL VERY LOW WHEN YOU FACTOR THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA SO IT'S AN INADEQUATE- LOW INCOME LEVEL DETERMINATION. WHAT IS B. THREE SIXTY FOUR WAS PUT US ON THE PATH OF BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE ALL SCHOOL CHILDREN WITHOUT MEALS WITHOUT MEANS TESTING SCHOOL MEALS WHICH WOULD SOLVE HUNGER WHICH WOULD SOLVE THE STIGMA OF GETTING A FREE MEAL. WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE FAMILY SCHOOL MEAL DEBT AND CUT MUCH ADMINISTRATION BUREAUCRATIC COSTS FOR SCHOOLS AND ALSO ALLOW OUR STATE TO MAXIMIZE OUR COLLECTION OF FEDERAL DOLLARS BECAUSE WE STILL LEAVE MANY ANTI HUNGER MONIES PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE TABLE AND DO NOT. PART ABLE TO COLLECTED. MEALS FOR ALL PROGRAMS. HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BOOST SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AND ACHIEVEMENT. AND THAT'S OUR PURPOSE AND NOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE OUR- MY WITNESSES BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE BILL.

I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB THREE SIXTY FOUR BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE SIGNIFICANT STEPS TOWARDS ENDING CHILD HUNGER IN CALIFORNIA. PROVIDING MEALS AT NO COST TO ALL STUDENTS WOULD REDUCE CHILDHOOD HUNGER BY ELIMINATING STIGMA AND ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE PREPARED TO LEARN. MY COLLEAGUES IN FULL IN SCHOOL NUTRITION AND I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE STUDENTS THAT GO HUNGRY WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE MONEY TO PAY FOR SCHOOL MEALS. IN FACT I HAVE STUDENTS WHO SHOW UP ON MONDAYS FOR BREAKFAST AND TELL ME THEY DO NOT THEY DID NOT EAT OVER THE WEEKEND BECAUSE IT WASN'T THEIR TURN TO EAT. IT'S HEARTBREAKING IT'S UNJUST AND IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE. SINCE THERE'S SO MUCH NEED IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT WE HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FEW DISTRICTS ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY PROVISION DISTRICT WIDE TO PROVIDE EVERY STUDENT WITH FREE SCHOOL MEALS. THIS HAS REDUCED ABSENTEEISM DECREASE TARDINESS AND PREPARED KIDS TO LEARN ONE SCHOOL NURSE IT WAS THE BEST PROGRAM HE HAS EVER SEEN BECAUSE IT ELIMINATED ALL HUNGER RELATED VISITS TO HIS OFFICE. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR WOULD ALLOW EVERY DISTRICT TO THE FEDERAL LABOR SINCE THE START OF CODED. FREE SCHOOL MEALS FOR ALL SPOKE ALL SHOULD NOT END WITH THE WAIVERS EXPIRE ON SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR WILL REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE DEPARTMENTS WHEN ARE DISTRICTS WHICH DEFEATING EVERY STUDENT AT NO COST WE WERE ABLE TO SHIFT THREE LEE AND THE LABOR OF THREE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES. FROM PROCESSING MAIL APPLICATIONS SENDING OUT LETTERS AND ANSWERING PHONE CALLS FROM CONCERNED PARENTS INSTEAD THAT STOP TIME IS NOW REDIRECTED TO CREATING BETTER TASTING FRESHER MEALS THAT HAVE INCREASED PARTICIPATION.

THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND- CERTAINLY- MAKE COMPELLING ARGUMENTS FOR THIS BILL I DID HAVE A QUESTION AN ANALYSIS- THEY TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUE THE CENTRAL KITCHENS IN KNOW THAT MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS DOYOU CENTRAL KITCHENS AS A WAY TO MORE EFFICIENTLY UP. THOSE FRESH MIGLIOR TALKING ABOUT- HE JUST'S NOT INSIDE OF CAN YOU CAN SPEAK TO- THE SUGGESTION IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WE ALLOW THE SCHOOLS TO BUILD THE POOL THEIR FUNDS. FROM THE- GRANTS TO THE PER SCHOOL SITE TO BE ABLE TO- TO DEVELOPER YOU CENTRAL KITCHENS TO ACHIEVE THE GAMES OF THIS BILL. CERTAINLY SO- WE'RE DEFINITELY OPEN TO LOOKING AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT THE- THESE GRANT PROGRAM WAS STARTED A GOOD NUMBER OF YEARS BACK IN FACT I BELIEVE WAS TWENTY THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN. WHERE WE THE STATE STARTED OFFERING SCHOOL DISTRICTS GRANTS BECAUSE WE RECALL THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE DISTRICTS HAD CLOSED KITCHENS AND THEN THERE WAS A MOVE TO BEGIN TO RE OPEN AND SO WE STARTED A GRANT PROGRAM. THAT WOULD ENABLE DISTRICTS TO EITHER BRING BACK THEIR FOOD SERVICE OR DO CENTRAL KITCHENS ARE VARIETY OF THINGS AND THAT GRANT PROGRAM NEVER- WHICH WE SAY- WAS BIASED AGAINST A CENTRAL COMMITTEE KITCHEN VERSUS A ON SITE SO I WANTED WE I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE SURE TO LOOK AT OURS. THANK BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT THAT BIAS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF THAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY FOR THE DISTRICT TO DO SO WE'D WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. EVERY SHEET TO YOU LOOKING INTO THAT- AND CERTAINLY- HAPPY TO MOVE TO BUILD APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. CENTER TROUBLED. JUST WANTED TO- THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND FOR REALLY WATCHING OUT FOR LITTLE OUR KIDDOS IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS I THINK- WHEN YOU HEAR THE TESTIMONIES OF PEOPLE GOING HUNGRY AND- I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AS FAR AS THE RESEARCH GOES IN THE DATA SHEET THAT THAT THE OPPORTUNE TO HAVE REVIEWED MANY MUCH OF THAT. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT- YOU KNOW OUR MEALS AND HOW THAT WILL BENEFIT THE OVERALL WELL BEING AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR CHILDREN AND PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOLS- IT SAY. HE SHORT TERM INVESTMENT FOR LONG- FOR A LONG BENEFITS ON THE COME FROM IT'S A THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT APPRECIATED. THANK YOU CENTER CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU BRING THIS BILL FORD I JUST. WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU AN EXPERIENCE THAT- I WITNESSED ACTUALLY. PURFLING THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO ALLOW THESE CHILDREN TO TAKE A TO GET FED UP AND- NO MATTER WHAT YOUR INCOME IS I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE- HERE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE COST OF THE IN CALIFORNIA ARE SKYROCKETING AS A FACT. WE ALL KNOW THAT AND SOMETHING WE SHOULD WORK ON IT WHEN OTHER AREAS AS WELL. BUT I KNOW THAT TIME AT LEAST IN THE LAW SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE. MY CHILDREN ATTENDED AND- I WITNESSED ACTUALLY WERE KIDS YOU KNOW THERE'S LEFTOVER FOOD SOMETIMES. AND THE LAW DOESN'T ALLOW THE SERVICE PROVIDERS THE TWO TEACHERS- THE COOKS TO ACTUALLY LET THOSE KIDS TAKE THAT FOOD I WITNESSED KIDS STEALING IT BASICALLY WHEN THAT WHEN THEY'RE NOT WATCHING AND PUTTING IT IN THEIR BACKPACKS SO THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT WHEN THEY GET HOME. AND SO THERE WAS SOME WAY WE COULD CRAFT AN ABILITY THAT FOOD'S GONNA GET THROWN IN AND IT GETS THROWN IN THE DUMPSTER AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S PART OF THAT 40% OF THE FOOD TO GET WASTED IN AMERICA BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T GET IT DOESN'T MEET THE CRITERIA SO I WOULD ASK IF THERE IS SOME. ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT FOOD IT'S GOING TO BASICALLY BE THROWN AWAY AND IT LET THOSE CHILDREN TAKE IT WITH THEM BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM THAT WAS THEIR DINNER AND THEY WERE THEY WERE SNEAKING THAT WHEN THEY WHEN THEY WERE GRABBING OPPORTUNITIES OR EVEN TAKEN OFFICE SOMEBODY ELSE'S. PLAY WHEN THEY DIDN'T FINISH IT IT'S JUST. THIS WASTE AND IT'S AS- SOME I WANTED TO MATCH TO YOU THAT MY- IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW I KNOW THERE'S FOOD. BORNE ALLERGIES AND OR OR THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO FOOD AFTER YOU STORE BUT- THERE SHOULD BE COULD BE WAY ME WE COULD. SELL THAT UP AND- SEND IT HOME WITH THEM. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU CHAIR- CENTER'S GONNA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO US TODAY- IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT I KNOW WE'RE NOT THE FISCAL COMMITTEE BUT- COULD YOU JUST AT LEAST- GIVE US SOME SENSE OF THAT COSTS THAT SUIT AT THIS BILL IS EXPECTED TO BE. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION WE- WE DON'T HAVE THE FULL COST. ESTIMATE YET. BECAUSE PART OF IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON. WHETHER CERTAIN OF THE- PROGRAMS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD ENACTED. AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE SCHEDULED TO SUNSET. IF THEY CONTINUE HOWEVER. THEN THE- WHAT. NUMBER ONE CALIFORNIA ALREADY IS NOT. MAXIMIZING ITS RECEIPT. OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SCHOOL MEALS. SO ON WE'RE STILL CALCULATING EVEN IF THERE'S NO CHANGE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SWEAT. THE THIS BILL WOULD COST US IF WE WERE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THAT WE'RE STILL DOING THAT. THOSE CALCULATIONS. HOWEVER IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WERE TO. ON EITHER ENACT PERMANENTLY OR EXTEND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE SET UP. DURING THE PANDEMIC. THEN THAT WOULD REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S COST EVEN FURTHER SO WILL WE WILL BE DOING. TO ESTIMATES ON ON THE COST. AND YOU MADE REFERENCE IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT ABOUT FEDERAL MONEY BEING LEFT ON THE TABLE YES YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THAT. PROJECTION IS- I'M POLICIES I DO NOT HAVE THAT NUMBER AT THE TOP AT MY FINGERTIPS BUT I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO GET IT FOR YOU. I KNOW THAT- YOU IN IT WITH ANOTHER HAD ON HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF TRYING TO MAKE THESE DIFFICULT BUDGET CHOICES YES. FOR MANY MANY GOOD THINGS AND- CERTAINLY THIS IS ONE THAT- IS FOUNDATIONAL FOR OUR STUDENTS. TO DO WELL IN SCHOOL AND TO LIVE HEALTHY LIVES SO. I APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'LL FACE AND NOT TRYING TO. FIGURE THAT OUT BUT HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND WITH THE BILL TODAY APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY BIG CENTER GLAZER. SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTERS. CAN I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU TO- ONE OF THE THINGS I DID MANAGE WAS THAT. IN THIS P. YEAR. THERE WERE MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO. A HAS WE KNOW MOST GOALS WERE CLOSE. AND YET WE STILL HAD. THAT WERE HUNGRY OR NEEDED A- AND SO MY MANY TO CAN THEIR MIL PROGRAM. AND IN MAY CASES THEY WERE PROVIDING MEALS BEYOND. THAT WHICH THEY PROVIDED PRE PAN. AND IN A BECAUSE THE TWO FOR PROBE. THE PBT AND ANOTHER. THE SCHOOL TO. SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE ABLE TO. I WOULD SAY COVER THEIR FULL COSTS BUT YOU KNOW COVER SOME LEVEL OF THAT COST OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS WENT INTO DEBT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE MEALS THAT THEY PROVIDED DURING THIS PANDEMIC TIME TO A PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT I DID NOT MENTION IS THE ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE A MEAL PROGRAM WENDOUREE ARE SCHOOL CLOSURES. BECAUSE WE COULD FACE ANOTHER IN AT LET'S SAY- ANY KIND OF DISASTER WHERE THERE WOULD MIGHT MIGHT BE SIGNED AND WE KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS ARE STILL SO ESSENTIAL FOR THE STUDENTS. SO THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF THE BILL THE OTHER ASPECT THAT WAS MENTIONED BY SOME CALLERS THAT ARE DID NOT EMPHASIZE WHICH I SHOULD HAVE IS THAT ANOTHER COMPONENT THIS BILL. IS- THE CONCEPT OF PROVIDING MEALS FOR OUR STUDENTS AS PART OF EDUCATION HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. BUT THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE OVER THE LAST SAY FIFTEEN YEARS IS THERE IS THIS HUGE NETWORK OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT HAVE BEEN BOTH. BRINGING BACK THEIR- INDIVIDUAL KITCHENS WERE. FOR CENTRALIZED KITCHENS AND PREPARING MORE MEALS ON SITE AND DEVELOPING. RELATIONSHIPS AND PURCHASE PROGRAMS DIRECTLY WITH CALIFORNIA GROWERS AND CALIFORNIA FOOD PRODUCERS FOOD MANUFACTURERS. TO CUT THEIR COSTS AND IF WE THINK ABOUT OUR OWN AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS CALIFORNIA GETS THE LEAST FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR THE CROPS THAT WE GROW. WE ARE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN SECTION NOT OR DO NOT GET MANY OF THE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES SO. BEYOND WHEN OUR SCHOOLS CAN HAVE THOSE KIND OF DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR GROWERS IT GREATLY HELPS OUR AG PRODUCERS AND SO THERE'S A COMPONENT THIS BILL THIS GREW OUT OF THIS NETWORK. AND THERE'S A COMPONENT OF THE BILL THAT WOULD. ALLOW FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND ALSO APPLY FOR GRANTS FOR THAT SO IT BENEFITS OUR AG PRODUCERS ADDITIONALLY. SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND APPRECIATE THE GOOD DISCUSSION WE'VE HAD THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAN BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT STANDARD DOLLAR TO YOUR POINT ALL IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SB FIVE FIVE SEVEN WAS PASSED. WHICH DOES ALLOW FOR SOME FOOD SHARING I KNOW ONE OF MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS RIALTO THEY HAVE A FOOD SHARING TABLE NOT ALL FOOD FOR THE PURPOSES YOU STATED CAN BE PUT THERE BUT I THINK SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MOVING TO THAT AND WE JUST MORE INFORMATION ON FIVE FIVE SEVEN THAT YOU CAN SHAREWITH YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. SO WITH THAT MATAMATA CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM NUMBER TWO SB THREE SIXTY FOUR THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON HUMAN SERVICES LEYVA. HI THEY'VE AYE OCHO ABODE I WHICH WILL BUILD A COURTESY HI FOR TENNESSEE I. DELI I GLAZER HI GLAZER AYE. PAN HI AND I. BELIEVE THE BILL IN CONGRESS MY TO VOTE ON. THANK YOU CENTERS HAVE A GOOD.

WELCOME CENTER EGGMAN PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I WANT TO PRESENT TO SB SIX NINETY NINE- WHICH DEALS WITH THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL CLIMATE. RESEARCH INDICATES THAT SCHOOL CLIMATE STRONGLY INFLUENCES STUDENTS MOTIVATION TO LEARN AND IMPROVE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT- WE ALL KNOW THAT PEOPLE DO BETTER WHEN THEY ARE IN A IN A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT- ALREADY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED EVERY OTHER YEAR TO DO A- CLIMATE SURVEY- SO THIS IS JUST TAKING IT A STEP FURTHER AND JUST SAYING THE RESULTS OF THAT CLIMATE SURVEY SHOULD SERVE AS A STATE WIDE INDICATOR AND BE ON THE DASHBOARD SO PARENTS OR COMMUNITY MEMBERS OR STUDENTS THEMSELVES CAN LOOK AROUND. AND SEE WHAT THE CLIMATE IS SO THE- THE IDEA IS THAT THERE'S ALREADY SOME EXISTING TOOLS BUT THAT FROM THOSE EXISTING TOOLS SOME COMMON INDICATORS WILL BE DEVELOPED SO THAT WE CAN THEN MEASURE AND PUT THAT STATEWIDE ACROSS ON ON DASHBOARDS AND SO AGAIN PEOPLE CN REFER TO THAT AND THEN WE CAN ALSO DEVELOP- SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS BASED ON THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO SUGGEST WAYS TO IMPROVE. THE CLIMATE WE KNOW IN OUR TIMES OF A EXTREME POLARIZATION- A LOT OF- TENSION IN THE AIR THAT THAT OFTEN FILTERS DOWN TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEIR EXISTING IN SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TRACKING THAT AND THAT THEN WE CAN DO A APPROPRIATE INTERVENTIONS AS NEEDED- WITH ME HERE TODAY I HAVE SEVERAL LOUIS. LUIS LITTLE YES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TEACH PLUS CALIFORNIA AND JENNY SHE WOULD KING AN EDUCATOR WHO TEACHES ENGLISH AT AMADOR VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL IN PLEASANTON TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT VERY GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN WITNESSES PLEASE PROCEED I THINK ASA CEREBELLUM.

ARE POLICY FELLOWS DURING WHAT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST OVERWHELMING YEAR OF THEIR CAREERS. HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE MOST PERSISTENT CHALLENGES THAT THE CRISES OF THE LAST YEAR HAVE UNDERSCORED. DEAN HOW THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL TOLL ON STUDENT THIS YEAR HAS REINFORCED HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. FOR OUR SCHOOLS TO PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE CHILD. AND WHILE MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE EMBRACED THAT IMPERATIVE. THAT IS NOT THE CASE EVERYWHERE. A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHEN THOSE. THOSE SCHOOL. FEEL SAFE VALUED CARED FOR RESPECTED AND ENGAGED LEARNING INCREASES. AND IT ALLOWS STUDENTS TO GROW SOCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. NEVERTHELESS EVEN WITH THIS ROBUST EVIDENCE SOME TEACHERS WERE FRUSTRATED THAT DISTRICT AND SCHOOL LEADERS WERE NOT INVESTING TIME AND RESOURCES AND SCHOOL CLIMATE. WE KNOW THAT THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL CLIMATE IN GENERAL BEING IS NOT A NEW ONE. BUT HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THERE IS MORE CONSISTENT FOCUS ON THESE ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE'RE HOPEFUL AND HELP TRANS TO HEALTHIER FAST MOVING TO A SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT FOCUSES ON MULTIPLE MEASURES INCLUDING SCHOOL CLIMATE DATA. BUT BECAUSE LEDS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO USE ANY PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT. THERE IS NOT CONSISTENT YET ACROSS THE STATE. AS A RESULT THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD DOES NOT REFLECT THE FINDINGS OF THE SURVEY OR ANY REFLECTION OF THE DISPARATE EXPERIENCES BETWEEN GROUPS IT. FURTHERMORE SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEY ARE IN. THAT IS USED TO IDENTIFY ELLIE EIGHT. AGAIN MY DISTRICT WHO NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN DO BETTER TO CREATE A SYSTEMIC OKAY SOME POSSIBLE CLIMATE. SB SIX NINETY NINE WILL PRODUCE COMPARABLE DATA THAT CAN BE USED TO INFORM POLICIES AND IMPROVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROPERTY DISTRICT COURT BY. BOTH LEADING REBEL OF THE FLEXIBILITY. WITH CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE DATA THE STATEMENT THEY CALLED US WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY ELEAZAR STRUGGLING TO CREATE POSITIVE SCHOOL CLIMATE FOR ALL STUDENTS ONE FOR PARTICULAR SUBGROUPS OF STUDENTS. AND GET THEM HELP THROUGH THE STATE RUN SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. HE WILL ALSO IDENTIFY. THOSE THAT ARE TELLING IS MODELED. AT SIX NINETY ON BILLS ON PREVIOUS IN THE- WITH OTHER PAPA BEING. WHEN IS THE SB SIX NINETY NINE MAKE CLEAR THE GOAL OF ELEVATING THE STATE WITH THE IN THE- ON FOOTING OTHER INDICATORS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE SURVEYS ALONG WILL NOT CHANGE PRACTICE AND CULTURE SCHOOL.

SCHOOL CONNECTED MESSAGE DROPPED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AN AVERAGE OF 5% ACROSS GRADE LEVELS. NOTABLY THAT PERCENTAGE DIFFERENCE WHY DID TO A 13% DROP FOR HISPANIC AND LATINO STUDENTS EACH AND A DISTRICT SCHOOL CLIMATE DATA ALSO SHOWED SIMILAR PATTERNS WHEN LOOKING AT SCHOOL SAFETY.

ASIAN AMERICAN FAMILIES WERE MUCH MORE JUST PORTION RELUCTANT TO SEND OUR KIDS AND FOR IN PERSON LEARNING. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEIR CHILDREN OFTEN COATED- GIVEN THE REPORTS OF HATE ATTACKS AND HATE INCIDENTS AGAINST TI AND THE NEED FOR SAFE SPACES FOR. ASIAN AMERICANS- IN ALL PARTS SIDELING COLLUDING IN SCHOOL FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AND SO THE SCHOOL CLIMATE YOU KNOW HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON- DEBILITY AS CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO LEARN- THERE IT DOES STANLEY'S COMFORT AND- SO I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD- I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT IN THE- GREAT RECESSION ACTUALLY- FUNDING.

CONSENT CALENDAR. CHAIR VOTING ON A VICE CHAIR VOTING I PAN. AYE PAN AYE. KANNST CONSECTETUER HAS BEEN APPROVED THANK YOU WELCOME SENATOR HUESO PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FROM HER WOMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESS PRESENT SB SEVEN OH FIVE. THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO COME UP WITH THE STRATEGIC PLAN. INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GRANT PROGRAM TO SUPPORT BY NATIONAL WORKFORCE AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CALIFORNIA MEXICO CORPORATION HELD A HEARING ENTITLED THE STUDENTS WE SHARE. A DISCUSSION ON EXPANDING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRANS BORDER STUDENTS. NOW I JUST WANT TO PUT ALL OF THIS IN A CONTEXT. IN THE UNITED STATES IF YOU IF YOU MEASURE ALL THE STATES THAT ALONG THE UNITED STATES MEXICO BORDER AND THAT THAT IS THE STATE'S ON THE US SIDE AND STATES ON THE MEXICO SIDE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THIRD LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. IN MANY CASES- THE- THE INTERACTIONAL LONG BORDERS EXTREMELY COMPLEX. WE HAVE A LOT OF CHILDREN. OF AMERICAN CITIZENS ACTUALLY LIVING IN MEXICO. AND BEEN EDUCATED IN THE US WE HAVE OTHERS THAT ARE LIVING IN THE U. S. BEEN EDUCATED MEXICO. WE HAVE A VERY COMPLEX- RELATIONSHIP OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THAT'S HAPPENING ALONG THE BORDER IN A VERY COMPLEX BORDER THAT'S INTERNATIONAL. OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE. IF YOU CONSIDER ALL THE TRADE THAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT THE ONE OF THE BUSIEST PORT THE FOURTH. BUSIEST PORTS IN TERMS OF- GOODS MOVEMENT. IS A SENATOR BORDER CROSSING. AND SO THIS THIS COMPLETES THESE BORDER THESE- INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS COMPETE. WITH ALL THE PORTS IF YOU CONSIDER THE LONG BEACH PORT DE LA PORT THESE ARE MASSIVE OF PORTS THAT MOVE GOODS THAT GOES PARKS CANADA. AND IN MANY OF THOSE GOODS GO WE ACTUALLY INTO MEXICO AS WELL SO IF YOU CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF GOODS MOVEMENT HAPPENING THE BORDER THE AMOUNT OF BORDER CROSSINGS WITH THE BUSIEST BORDER CROSSING IN THE WORLD. IN MY DISTRICT AND SENATE ZERO. AND WE HAVE A JUST A COMPLEX. COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT COME BACK AND FORTH EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. IS CORRECT WILL GREATLY UNDERSERVED IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT APPLIED TO ADMIT EDUCATING THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND PREPARING THEM FOR. THE ECONOMY THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY A MAJOR PART OF. SO THIS THIS BILL IS ASKING THAT WE START TO CREATE A STRATEGIC PLAN TO GET BETTER OUTCOMES AND PREPARE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO ENTER FIELDS THAT ARE GOING TO PROVIDE. THEM NOT ONLY WITH A PERSONAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES BUT THAT THEY CONTRIBUTE. TO THE SKILL SET THAT THEY HAVE WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENT THEY WERE RAISED TO A KANEMI THAT IS PERFECT FOR THEM TO SUCCEED. AND SO. YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU CONSIDER THAT IN BASRA CALIFORNIA ALONG THE STATE ACROSS THE BORDER FROM MARS THIS IS A STATE THE BORDERS MY DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE AN ESTIMATED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THAT IN THAT AREA. THE STUDENTS MAKE ABOUT A PART OF A GROWING POPULATION BY NATIONAL STUDENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER WHOSE EDUCATION IS DEEPLY SHAPED BY THE BY NATIONAL EXPERIENCES THEY SHARE. IN MY DISTRICT WHICH ENCOMPASSES THE WHOLE BORDER OF MEXICO. HE BY NATIONAL LIVES OF THE STUDENTS FROM FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. OTHERS ATTENDING COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MEANS THAT THEY MUST CROSS THE BORDER SOMETIMES MORE THAN ONCE A DAY. PAN AND THIS IS IN LARGE PART HOW THEY ARE PREPARING THEMSELVES FOR THE FUTURE RESEARCH FROM UCSD HAS SHOWN THAT STUDENTS WILL BY NATIONAL EXPERIENCES REPORT LOWER EDUCATIONAL ASPIRATIONS THAN THOSE OF THEIR PEERS WITHOUT BY NATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND THERE. IN LIES IT SHOWS THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE ANY KIND OF SUPPORT. ON ON GUIDING THEM TO A GO TO COLLEGE. SO BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO JOINTLY BUILD A PLAN WE CAN TURN. HOW WE CAN I'M SORRY WE CAN IN TURN ADDRESS CHALLENGES FACED BY THE BI NATIONAL STUDENT POPULATION AND BUILD THE WORK FORCE NEEDED. TO BUILD A MORE EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE CROSS BORDER ECONOMY IN DOING SO WE NOT ONLY SUPPORT THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE STUDENTS BUT WE ENSURE. THEY BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF THE ECONOMY THROUGH APPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THEIR SKILLS TO JOIN OUR WORK FORCE AND THIS'S CLAYTON GENTLEMAN WHAT AN AREA WHERE CALIFORNIA'S WE CAN COMPARE TO OTHER STATES OF THE UNION. WHERE WE CAN STRENGTHEN THIS AREA OF OUR SOCIETY AND IN TURN HELP BUILD OUR ECONOMY AND CREATE A MORE PROSPEROUS. FOUGHT THE STATE FOR. THE OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE AND ALSO JOINED IN AND HELPING. TO BUILD THE ECONOMIES ACROSS THE BOARD- AND MAY SURE THAT OF OUR PARTNER TO THE SOUTH ALSO SHARES IN THAT PROSPERITY. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER HUESO I THINK YOU HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES AND LEAD SUPPORT I HAVE LISTED- PETRY CEO JIM TERRA AND DOCTOR OLYMPIA. CORRECT CORRECT CACTUS I AM VERY SORRY I KNOW I PRONOUNCE IT IT IS AND BUT TO CHECK ON THAT ARE BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU SIR ALL RIGHT WE WILL-LET. WITNESSES DECIDE WHO'S GOING FIRST PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES. I'M READY ANTICIPATED CHECK ON. BUT OUT. AND I WILL. PROCEED I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE TO SHARE YOU MY VERY FIRST SO FOR S. SEVEN OH FIVE. I HAVE JUST WHICH THOSE ESTUDIANTES GIGGLE BOND CREAM SPRY. TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FIRST YEARS DURING WHICH WE RESEARCH BILL KERR MEXICO PARTNER. ALONG PILOT PROJECTS ON BOTH SIDE OF THE BALL. I'M SPEAKING TODAY WITH YOU THIS BILL IS A URGING. TO I'LL TAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PRICE TO THE SENATE DID. AND SURE WITH YOU THAT LOS SAN DIEGO IN TWO THE ABOUT HOW KILEY TO. I IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND A MAJOR DRIVER OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. IT IS ALSO THE HOME OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TRANS NATIONAL U. S. AND MEXICAN STUDENTS WHO THIS REGION IS RELYING ON TO FILL THE JOBS AND FUEL THE INTEGRATION. THAT THE REGION NEEDS TO REMAIN THIS POWER HOUSES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S FALLING BEHIND THE MEXICAN ORIGIN STUDENTS ON THE US SIDE ARE THE LEAST LIKELY OF ANY GROUP TO COMPLETE A COLLEGE DEGREE. AUSTIN 16% OF THESE MEXICAN ORIGIN STUDENTS COMPLETE A COLLEGE DEGREE COMPARED 2406% FOR WHITE STUDENTS AND 62% FOR ASIANS. AND THIS IS THE MAJORITY OF THE STUDENT POPULATION IN THE AREA. THE CROSS THE BORDER IN TIJUANA WE HAVE FIFTY THREE THOUSAND US CITIZENS STUDENTS TRYING TO MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE MEXICANS COOLING SYSTEM. BEFORE THEY RETURNED TO THE U. S. BUT MOST DON'T READ AND WRITE SPANISH AND SO THEY FLOUNDER IN SCHOOL. AND MANY ARE LEFT OUT OF THE SYSTEM ALTOGETHER BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SPACE AND OFTEN THE NEED TO WORK. THE AVERAGE COMPLETION RATE DISCOUNT OF SCHOOLING IN BAJA CALIFORNIA IS JUST NINTH GRADE. THIS IS THE FUTURE WORK FORCE FOR THE REGION AND THEY'RE NOT BEING ADEQUATELY PREPARED. THE REAL SHAME ABOUT THIS TOO IS THAT THESE ARE POTENTIALLY OUR BEST STUDENTS. OUR RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT THEY'RE TENACIOUS PERSISTENT AND OPTIMISTIC. THEY WANT GOOD JOBS THEY ALSO WANT A COLLEGE EDUCATION- THEY'RE BILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL. THERE THE NATURAL BRIDGE BUILDERS AND SOCIAL BROKERS THAT OUR TWO NATIONS NEED. TO RAISE THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND BETTER PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE WORKFORCE WE NEED. WE NEED MANY MORE TRAINED BILINGUAL EDUCATORS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER AS WELL AS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO ENGAGE THE STUDENTS. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE AND FUND THE MECHANISMS TO DO THAT. WHAT ARE BY NATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WE HAVE CREATED SOME BILINGUAL TRANS NATIONAL CURRICULA PREPARED SOME TRANS NATIONAL TEACHER EDUCATORS. AND ARE CREATING PATHWAYS TO HELP MORE STUDENTS BECOME BILINGUAL TRANS NATIONAL TEACHERS THEMSELVES. BUT THE NEEDS ARE GREAT AND EXACERBATED MANY TIMES OVER BY THE PANDEMIC THAT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED THE SAME STUDENTS. THANK YOU YOU'RE WELL OVER YOUR LIFETIME PROVIDE.

TWENTY SIX THANK YOU TO THIS SENATOR HUESO FOR HIS SENSITIVITY TO THESE STUDENTS AND THEIR CROSS BORDER EXPERIENCES AND HOW. WE COULD HELP THEM MEET THEIR WITH THE BEST POTENTIAL AND I'M HAPPY TO MOVE TO BUILD THE PROPER TIME THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER SENATE CORTESE. THE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEASURE TO SUSTAIN HONOR WE CAN HEAR YOU THE LIGHTS NOT STAYING ON SO IT'S HARD TO TELL- IT AMAZES US GOOD ONE THREE SPECIFIC QUESTION A TO BE AUTHOR OF THANK YOU SENATOR- A LOT OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD TODAY IN AND UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LIMIT OFTEN FOR TESTIMONY BUT WAS REALLY FOCUS ON WHAT I HEARD IS THE FORMAL EDUCATION. ASPECT OF THE BILL AND I KNOW THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. GOES BEYOND THAT THE ANALYSIS- SPEAK. TO THE POLICE IN MY COPY THERE'S A- THE NUMERATION OF- WAYS THAT THE STRATEGIC PLAN CAN EFFECTUATE ITS GOALS. AND TO THOSE ARE EXPANDING BY NATIONAL INTERNSHIP IN WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS WHICH IN MY MIND DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE ROUTED THROUGH FORMAL EDUCATIONAL CHANNELS LIKE UNIVERSITIES ARE K. THROUGH TWELVE OBVIOUSLY WE- WEEKS WE HAVE SEVERAL BILLS IN THIS SESSION. OF THE DEAL WITH. APPRENTICESHIPS WITH APPLIED LEARNING WITH OF WORKFORCE TRAINING RELATIVE TO THE TRADES- WE ALL KNOW IT THAT BY NATIONAL CULTURAL. EXCHANGES WHICH IS ANOTHER LINE ITEM IF YOU WILL IN THE IN THE STRATEGIC SIDE OF THIS BILL- FOR A RELATIVELY COMMONPLACE BUT- THEDEPUTY TECH SECTOR- FOUR ONE- WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY VERY HAPPY IN THE STATE INCLUDING MY DISTRICT AND SILICON VALLEY- IN. THE HEALTHCARE IT CAN AND EVEN MY OWN ORIGINAL LOCATION OF THE LAW- ARE DUE IN ARE INTERESTED IN IN DOING EXCHANGES OF LIKE WHAT I HEAR THE BILL TALKING ABOUT I WOULD HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT. I JUST WANTED TO GET ON THE ON THE RECORD- FROM YOU AS TO HOW MUCH OF YOUR- INTENT WITH THE BILL IS FOCUSED IN THAT AREA. AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW THE FORMAL EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE OF BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS. AND GENERALLY THE WAY I CAN BEST ANSWER THAT IS TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW I I'M I'M PICKY BACK IN THIS BILL OVER. OVER OF. SEVERAL YEARS OF INVOLVEMENT ON THE SUBJECT NOT ONLY BY MYSELF BUT OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE THAT OF A DRESS THIS IS A CHALLENGE THAT NEEDS TO BE- TAKEN ON. AND SO I'M NOT THE FIRST. THE FIRST- YOU KNOW I HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO OTHER MEMBERS HAVE ALSO- STARTED A DIALOGUE ON THIS ON A BI NATIONAL DIALOGUE IN AND OUT DR GUN THAT US- I THINK COMMENTS WERE WERE VERY ON POINT IN TERMS OF HOW. IMPORTANT THIS BILL IS TO ADDRESSING THE NEED AND ONE OF THE THINGS SHE MENTIONED WAS A BI NATIONAL DIALOGUE WITH EDUCATORS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. ALL ONE NEEDS TO BE DONE. TO ADDRESS THIS TO GET THE STATE BEHIND THIS. AND TO DO AN ACTUAL STRATEGIC PLAN THAT INCORPORATES SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND SOME OF. SOME OF THE BEST. MINDS THAT WE HAVE IN IN BOTH STATES. TO UNDERSTAND THE I MEAN I MEAN SINCE WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION NOW WE HAVE A LOT MORE INFORMATION WE HAD BACK THEN. AND SOME OF THAT WAS HERE TODAY IN THIS HEARING. AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND ACTUALLY DO A MORE FOCUSED STUDY ON WHAT CAN BE DONE BY BOTH STATES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE- THE SHORTFALLS AND WHY THE STUDENTS. ARE NOT ATTENDING COLLEGE WHY THEY'RE NOT. GETTING THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SKILLS THAT THEY NEED WHAT IS LACKING AND SO I'M TRYING TO ENGAGE THE BEST MINDS THAT WE HAVE ON. ON ON ON BOTH SIDES OF STATE COME UP WITH A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT- THAT IS THE BEST YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN COME UP WITH TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS AND SEE WHAT WHAT COULD BE TWEAKED IN TERMS OF POLICY PUBLIC POLICY OR HOW WE ADDRESS. FUNDING OR HOW WE ENGAGE OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO DO TO OFFER THOSE INTERNSHIPS TO OFFER THOSE MEDICATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR BAJA TO STEP UP AND SAY YOU KNOW WE DO WANT TO FOCUS ON THIS CHALLENGED POPULATION THEIR CHALLENGE TO US BECAUSE THEY DON'T SPEAK FOR MANY OF THEM ARE NOT FULLY COMPETENT IN SPANISH AND THAT POSES CHALLENGES FOR US HOW CAN WE STRENGTHEN. THE DELIVERY OF EDUCATION OUR SIDE OF THE BORDER TO. IDENTIFIED THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POPULATION. NOT ONLY BECAUSE- THEY'RE UNDER OUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT THEY'RE ALSO BY NATIONAL STUDENTS ARE PROBABLY BE. EITHER ON THIS SIDE OR THAT SIDE OF THE BORDER CONTRIBUTING. TO THE SUCCESS OF THE OF. OF BOTH OF OUR STATE SO. I BELIEVE THAT- AND WE HAVE GONE THROUGH CONSIDERABLE ANALYSIS ON TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO WHERE DO WE START. I THINK WE WILL THE BEST PLACE TO START IS TO HAVE A PLAN. AND SO THIS WOULD GET US ON ON ON A PATHWAY TO DEVELOP THAT PLAN START TO IMPLEMENT AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL DO THAT SOONER BECAUSE- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE KIDS FUTURES AND LIVES ARE ARE CURRENTLY ON THE BALANCE WITH AWAITING THOSE RESOURCES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THROUGH THE TERROR- IN A AND I AM SATISFIED WITH THE RESPONSE I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL AND I'M JUST I'M JUST HOPING AS IT GOES FORWARD- THAT. IT DOESN'T BECOME OR THE DIRECTION DOESN'T BECOME MYOPIC OR RECEIVED IN THAT WAY IN TERMS OF EDUCATIONAL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF- EXCLUSIVELY UP HERE DOMINATING THE STRATEGIC PLAN THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M GETTING AT EVEN EVEN AT THE HIGHEST PROFESSIONAL LEVELS FOR EXAMPLE. BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE KNOW THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR SANCTIONS AND RUNS CONTINUED EDUCATION COURSES OF THE INTERNATIONAL THE BI NATIONAL. APPETITE FOR IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. REINING IN EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH SILICON VALLEY FOR EXAMPLE IS ENORMOUS- THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE RUN THROUGH. THE LAW SCHOOL ON WHICH- THAT I TENDED WERE WERE THERE ANY ANY ANY ATTORNEY TENDED TO CAN BE RUN. IT CAN BE RUN BY- BY OR SANCTIONED. AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL. OF BUILDING TRADES ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. YOUR RESPECTIVE OF ANY INVOLVEMENTFROM AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION- COULD SANCTION- APPLIED LEARNING IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WHICH I SEEK COLD OUT HERE. BUT I AM I'M JUST HOPING THAT WERE EXPANSIVE AND NOT. AND NOT TO EXCLUSIVE IN TERMS OF THE PARTNERS ARE IS REALLY WHAT I'M SAYING AND THAT THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY I WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT YEAH NO PUN INTENDED BUT TO- THANK YOU- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR. THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADJUST MY GET MY COMMENTS ON THE RECORD IN IT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR NINETY THREE BECAUSE OF IT. THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE- SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR GLAZER SENT AWAY SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AND THE QUESTIONS AND IF I CAN JUST FURTHER THAT. YOU KNOW AS A SENEGAL NATIVE AND- AND A SOUTH BAY RESIDENT MYSELF AND BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT COMMUNITY I CAN GIVE A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING. THAT WAS JUST COMPLETELY DONE. LOCALLY WHAT THE WHAT- THERE WAS A RECRUITER FOR UP. SCHOOL THAT ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT DO WE EVER RECRUIT ATHLETES AND STUDENTS. FROM MEXICO TO ATTEND OUR SCHOOL BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE CITIZENS LIVING. IN MEXICO THAT COULD COME TO OUR SCHOOL. AND IMAGINE IF YOU CONSIDER THAT THERE'S A FIFTY THOUSAND. OF A POPULATION OF FIFTY THOUSAND OTHER KIDS TO QUALIFY TO LEARN IN AMERICA HE SAID THIS IS A HUGE POOL FOR US TO. DRAW TALENT FROM. THE WERE THE FIRST SCHOOL IN SENEGAL TO START TO RECRUIT. STUDENTS AND ATHLETES FROM MEXICO. AND IN FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT FROM BEING THE ONLY. SCHOOL THAT GOT TO DO THAT OR DECIDED TO DO THAT THEY BECAME STATE CHAMPIONS IN FOOTBALL. AND THEY JUST RECRUITED SOME OF THE BEST I MEAN THEY HAD TO. THEY WANTED TO MEXICAN SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE BEST ATHLETES BRING MENTOR PROGRAM AND THEY WERE A LOCAL CAF CHAMPIONS AND STATE CHAMPIONS FOR I BELIEVE IT WAS LIKE THREE YEARS IN A ROW. THAT THAT'S JUST TALKING ABOUT FOOTBALL. AND THEN THE OTHER SCHOOL STARTED TO DO IT AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT OTHER SCHOOLS ALSO GOT VERY COMPETITIVE I'M TALKING ABOUT DOING THAT ACROSS THE BOARD IN ALL AREAS OF EDUCATION. AND NOT ONLY THAT IT'S NOT ONLY THAT IT'S LOOKING UP THIS POPULATION SAYING IF WE START A PROCESS THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE WILL BECOME MORE INFORMED THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND I BELIEVE THAT MORE RESOURCES WILL COME AND PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT. HOW TO TAKE ON THIS CHALLENGE IT FROM DIFFERENT WITH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND APPLYING THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE AND THEIR STATE WILL DEFINITELY COME UP WITH NEW METHODS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND AGAIN NEVER IT'S NEVER WAS QUESTION THAT. YOUNG PEOPLE FROM OUR COUNTRY GO. FOLLOW THEIR PARENTS TO A DIFFERENT COUNTRY I MEAN THAT SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN. I MEAN IT WE ALL KNOW ENGLAND SET UP SCHOOLS IN INDIA. AND SET UP SCHOOLS AND OTHER PLACES WHERE. THEY HAVE LARGE POPULATIONS OF THEIR CITIZENS. AND THEY FINANCE THEIR EDUCATION AND- AND BENNETT WE KNOW AMERICA DOES THAT AS WELL BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE BORDER THAT'S BEEN COMPLETELY. OVERLOOKED AND THE SAME SITUATION EXISTS- JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHY WE-SHOULDN'T. MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF WHO ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS LIVING ABROAD SO APPRECIATE.
