WERE FILING THEIR FIRST IN ARM

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:32.765
HAS A HIGHER COLOR TO IT -- HAS

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:34.967

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.491
THE VOTERS IN JUNE ELECTED A

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:13.726
DIFFERENT PERSON TO BE THE

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.094
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT SO YOU

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.630
HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL -- SOUR

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:21.133
BURDEN AND NOW YOU HAVE A A

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.235
LITTLE BIT OF OF OF SPLIT FROM A

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:23.802
LEADERSHIP STANDPOINT IN IN

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:28.874
DIRECTION.

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:31.010
MAY I ASK A QUESTION ABSOLUTELY

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:31.844
IT'S FUN WHAT DO YOU SEE

00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:33.812
HAPPENING WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:35.314
ONE DISTRICT THAT -- STILL HAS

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:38.517
BEEN DESIGNATED BY THE COE AS A

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:42.621
LACK OF GOING CONCERN OVER.

00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:44.423
SO I WILL I WISH I HAD POSITIVE

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.593
NEWS THERE SENATOR -- SPECIALLY

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.695
FOR YOU -- IS SINCE THIS IS IN

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:53.465
IN YOUR DISTRICT -- OUR TWO

00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:55.067
WEEKS AGO STAFF AND RECOMMENDED

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.903
A NUMBER OF BUDGET CUTS TO BRING

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.339
THEM IN -- TO A STRONGER FISCAL

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:03.309
HEALTH THE BOARD OPTED NOT -- TO

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:04.910
APPROVE ANY OF THEM.

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:06.445
THEY ISSUED NO MARCH FIFTEENTH

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.547
NOTICES OF WHICH SOME WERE

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.449
IMBEDDED IN THOSE CUTS NOT ALL --

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:13.352
AND SO THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:14.853
TO CORRECT THIS IS CHANGE THE

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.289
APPROACH TO CHANGE IT -- WE WERE

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:18.591
THERE WE HAD A TEAM THEIR LAST

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:20.593
WEEK LAST WEDNESDAY THURSDAY AND

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:21.493
FRIDAY.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.896
THIS WOULD BE OUR FOURTH VISIT --

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:26.332
IN THREE MONTHS.

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:27.700
THE TEAM LAST WEEK WAS THERE

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.635
SPECIFICALLY DO A FISCAL HEALTH

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.370
RISK ANALYSIS THAT WILL GIVE US

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:34.006
A LITTLE BETTER SENSE -- NOW

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:36.775
FACT NOT ABLE TO FACTOR IN THOSE

00:14:36.842 --> 00:14:38.944
CUTS THAT WERE PROPOSED -- AND

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.446
SO FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:41.347
A LACK A GOING CONCERN IS THE

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:42.615
SAME AS A NEGATIVE.

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.883
IT JUST CAN HAPPEN AT ANY POINT

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.453
THIS HAPPENED IN NOVEMBER --

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:49.221
INTERESTING THE DISTRICTS

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:51.790
SUBMITTED ITS SECOND ENORMOUS

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:52.591
QUALIFIED.

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.059
NOT QUITE SURE HOW YOU ARE A

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.694
LACK GOING CONCERNING YOUR

00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:58.397
QUALIFIED -- SO THAT'LL BE A

00:14:58.464 --> 00:14:59.865
CONVERSATION PROBABLY NEED TO

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.300
HAVE A COUNTY OFFICE ABOUT.

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.035
MOST LIKELY DOWNGRADING THAT TO

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:04.837
A NEGATIVE.

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:05.904
THE RIGHTS YOUR QUESTION IS.

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:07.673
I DON'T HAVE A AN ANSWER AT THIS

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.642
POINT -- WHAT ARE THE TYPICAL

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:11.844
NEXT STEPS IF WE'VE EVER SEEN A

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.879
SITUATION LIKE THIS BEFORE YES

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:15.948
SO TYPICAL NEXT STEPS ARE THIS

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:17.549
THE LOCAL ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:18.751
STEPS UP AND HAS WHAT THEY

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:19.785
NEEDED TO DO?

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:21.453
THEY DIDN'T DO THAT TWO WEEKS

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.889
AGO -- THEY CITED A LACK OF

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:26.592
CREDIBILITY IN THE NUMBERS --

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:28.360
THE DISTRICT HAS HAD A STRONG --

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.962
BUSINESS OFFICER THE LAST TWO

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:31.797
YEARS -- SHE'S INDICATED SHE

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:33.899
WILL NOT STAY BEYOND JUNE GIVEN

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:37.303
THE CIRCUMSTANCES -- AND SO I

00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:38.804
DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:40.272
CONCERNS WE AS AN AGENCY DON'T

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:41.740
HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:42.941
CREDIBILITY THE NUMBERS.

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:44.710
BUT CLEARLY THE DISTRICT BOARD --

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.145
WAS NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:49.148
STAFF'S RECOMMENDATIONS SO --

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:51.817
THE SUPERINTENDENT'S NEXT STEP

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:53.252
THE DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT --

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:54.353
OFFICE IS PART OF THE

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.921
GOVERNMENT'S TEAMS NEXT STEP IS

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:57.156
TO COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE

00:15:57.222 --> 00:15:59.224
SET OF CUTS THEY NEED O MAKE

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.360
CUTS -- THE DIFFERENCE YEARS

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:02.928
THAT WON'T INVOLVE ANY --

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:04.596
CERTIFICATED STAFF BECAUSE WILL

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:06.565
BE PASSED THAT WINDOW OF

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:10.836
OPPORTUNITY. FOR ME TO GET YOU

00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:13.238
OFF TO REFUND.

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:13.872
JUST WHAT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:14.740
BETWEEN.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.342
I'M QUALIFIED AND LACK OF GOING

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:20.045
CONCERN AN UNQUALIFIED.

00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:21.613
SO QUALIFY A WOULD IT BE SO IN

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.716
ALL CASES WERE LOOKING AT A

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:25.017
THREE YEAR WINDOW CURRENT YOUR

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:26.885
PLUS.

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:29.021
TO QUAL POSITIVE WOULD BE A

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:29.555
EVERYTHING IS WHERE IT'S

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:30.689
SUPPOSED TO BE.

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.291
QUALIFIED WOULD BE THEY MAY NOT

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:33.258
MEET THEIR OP FINANCIAL

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:34.793
OBLIGATIONS OVER THE THREE YEAR

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.061
WINDOW.

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:37.896
NEGATIVE IS THEY WILL NOT AND WE

00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:39.465
GENERALLY SHORTEN IT TO A TWO

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:41.600
YEAR WINDOW.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:45.137
BLACK A GOING CONCERN -- LOOKS

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:48.440
VERY MUCH LIKE A NEGATIVE --

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:49.942
LANGUAGE AROUND IT

00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:52.177
INTERPRETATIONS A TAD DIFFERENT

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:53.746
BUT THE INTER THE LIST OF

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:55.147
INTERVENTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE

00:16:55.214 --> 00:16:58.117
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT IS ALMOST

00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:00.652
EXACTLY THE SAME.

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:02.254
AND FROM A PROCEDURAL SAMPLE THE

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:04.423
WAY WE TREAT THEM UP ALMOST

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.325
IDENTICAL TO A NEGATIVE DISTRICT

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:08.427
A NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION. TO

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:11.397
HELP CENTER.

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:13.132
I WONDER WHY THEY CREATE ON THE

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:13.832
CATEGORY BUT THAT'S THE WAY

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:14.867
BUREAUCRACY Là TIME IT'S A

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:17.536
TIMING ISSUE -- SO THE

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.338
CERTIFICATIONS APOLOGY QUALIFIED

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:20.672
IN NEGATIVE HAPPENED WHEN THE

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:22.641
COUNTY IS WHEN THE DISTRICT THIS

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:25.344
IS -- DOING ITS FIRST AND SECOND

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:26.145
IN A ROOM.

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.913
IF SOMETHING CHANGED IN BETWEEN

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.348
THOSE POINT IN TIME THE COUNTY

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:30.749
SUPERINTENDENT HAS THIS

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:34.019
ADDITIONAL TOOL -- THAT IS A

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:35.187
THAT'S REALLY IRRESPECTIVE OF

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:36.855
TIME IT COULD HAPPEN THE DAY

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:38.123
AFTER THE ENORMOUS SUBMITTED.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.291
A DISTRICT COULD COMMIT A

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:41.493
POSITIVE INTERIM AND SOMETHING

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.229
CHANGE OVERNIGHT -- THE AVERAGE

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.064
SITUATION WHERE BOARD ELECTED

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:47.733
NOT TO MAKE CUTS THE CUTS MAY

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.401
HAVE DOES ANY OF THE DISTRICT AS

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:50.636
POSITIVE JUST.

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:53.906
USING A FOR EXAMPLE -- THEY

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:56.175
SUBMITTED THEIR IN A ROOM WITH

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:57.609
THE ANTICIPATION THE BOARD WAS

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.978
GOING TO ADOPT THOSE -- THEN ALL

00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:00.846
OF A SUDDEN A BOARD DOESN'T

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.748
ADOPT THEM IN THIS CASE AND

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:03.715
OVERNIGHT.

00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:05.784
THEN THE COUNTY WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:09.888
ABLE TO MOVE THEM FROM -- A TO A

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:11.256
LACK A GOING CONCERN IN FACT

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:13.091
USING OFFERED AS EXAMPLE THAT IS

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:14.460
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NOVEMBER.

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:15.928
THERE ARE THERE BUDGET WAS

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:17.129

SAID WHAT HAPPENED DOWN HILL BUT

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.471
WHY SUCH A DRAMATIC CHANGE IT WE

DRAMATIC -- JUST STAY PROGRESS

REGRESSED THEY REGRESS.

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:34.713
OKAY AND IT BECAME VERY APPARENT

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.415
IN NOVEMBER THAT THAT REGRESSION

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:39.985
WAS I WAS FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT ARE

BOARDS OFTEN DO NOT.

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:14.720
ALWAYS ADOPT STAFF'S

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:15.587
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT IN A CASE

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:17.489
LIKE THIS THESE WERE NOT OUT OF

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:20.292
THE SKY CUTS THESE WERE CUTS

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:21.793
THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED FOR

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.395
MANY WEEKS MANY MONTHS.

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:24.663
THE FINANCIAL CONDITION THE

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.999
DISTRICT HAS BEEN WIDELY KNOWN

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:28.133
THEY'VE HAD A BUDGET THANK

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.002
BUDGET VISOR COMMITTEE MADE UP

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:31.503
OF THEIR LABOR PARTNERS AND

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.205
COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND OTHER

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:34.773
STAFF MEETING FOR MONTHS I'VE

ACTUALLY PRESENTED TO THEM BACK

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:39.177
IN -- EARLY DECEMBER I THINK IT

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:40.946
WAS A MAYBE END OF NOVEMBER

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.649
CAN'T RECALL NOW -- TO GIVE THEM

00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:49.254
KIND OF A AN OVERVIEW OF PROCESS --

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:51.056
SO THE THE LACK OF SUPPORT BY

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:53.892
THE BOARD ON A GIVEN EVENING WAS

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:56.929
NOT EXPECTED OKAY AND TIMING WAS

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:59.031
SUCH.

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:00.465
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT TWO WEEKS

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:00.999
AGO I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:03.035
FOURTEENTH FIVE IF I HAVE MY

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:05.571
DATES RIGHT -- THAT LEFT NO

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:07.573
ALTERNATIVE.

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:08.440
AHEAD OF MARCH FIFTEENTH.

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:10.509
RIGHT SO COMPLETELY CHANGES NOW

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:13.612
THE LANDSCAPE OF WHAT CUTS ARE --

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:14.913
POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO THE

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.549
DISTRICT EVEN TO ACT ON NOW

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:19.585
SUBSEQUENT SO THEY'RE PROBABLY

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:20.686
GOING THE WAY OF A NEGATIVE

00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:22.588
CERTIFICATION BUT WHAT I'M MORE

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:24.456
CONCERNED ABOUT IS IF THEY DON'T

00:20:24.523 --> 00:20:26.658
MAKE THE CUT.

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:27.225
THEN WILL THE SCHOOL LIKELY

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:28.193
CLOSE.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.528
NO NO NO THIS IS IT JUST THIS IS

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:31.863
A DISTRICT OF TWENTY THOUSAND

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:36.535
WITH -- WHILE I SHOULD KNOW THIS --

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:38.170
EIGHTEEN SCHOOLS AT LEAST THREE

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:40.739
HIGH SCHOOLS AND AN ALTERNATIVE

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:43.775
HIGH SCHOOL -- PLUS NUMEROUS --

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:45.210
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS SO NO THE

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:47.112
NEXT STEP IN THIS PROCESS FOR

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:48.747
THE COUNTY WOULD BE.

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:50.482
IF THE DISTRICT DOESN'T ADOPT

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:52.618
ALTERNATIVE CUTS IN THEIR IN

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:54.720
JUNE FOR THEIR ADOPTED BUDGET

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:56.221
THAT'S EFFECTIVE JULY.

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:57.756
ONE THE NEXT OPTION THE COUNTY

00:20:57.823 --> 00:20:59.758
HAS WOULD BE TO DISAPPROVE THEIR

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.526
BUDGET FOR THE NEW YEAR.

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:02.995
THAT SETS IN MOTION THEN A

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:05.731
PROCESS IT'S FAIRLY LAID OUT IN -

00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:07.866
PROCESS IT'S ARTICULATED FAIRLY

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:10.602
WELL IN CODE -- THERE ARE TO

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:12.537
PASS ONE IS WHAT'S CALLED A

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.172
BUDGET REVIEW COMMITTEE PROCESS

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:15.707
WHICH IS LAID OUT IN SOME DETAIL

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:18.243
IN THE LAST DECADE WE'VE USE

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.144
THAT PROCESS ONCE.

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:21.947
IT CAN BE WAIVED WHICH IS TO

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:23.682
ADDITIONALLY WHAT HAPPENS -- BY

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:24.850
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COUNTY

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.318
SUPERINTENDENT IN THE DISTRICT'S

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:29.221
BOARD THEY WAVE THAT PROCESS.

00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:31.957
AND THEN CD E. GENERALLY AGREES

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.392
IF IF YOU'VE GOT AGREEMENT LOCAL

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.260
USED CD WOULD GENERALLY AGREE

00:21:35.327 --> 00:21:37.796
WITHOUT -- AND THEN THEY WILL

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:39.998
THEY WILL GO THROUGH A PROCESS

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:43.702
TO WORK THINGS OUT -- UP TO THE

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:44.903
DECEMBER TIME PERIOD.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.238
THEY DO CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:47.673
AUTHORITY TO SPEND BECAUSE THE

00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:49.975
LOCAL BOARD HAS ADOPTED A BUDGET

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:51.410
IT'S THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:52.844
THAT IT DOESN'T MEET THE

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:54.212
CRITERIA IS UNABLE TO APPROVE IT.

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:57.115
SO THIRTY TO SPEND DOES CONTINUE --

00:21:57.182 --> 00:21:58.617
BUT ULTIMATELY THEY'LL HAVE TO

00:21:58.684 --> 00:22:00.752
DEAL WITH.

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:01.987
WITH THE FACT THAT THE BUDGETS

00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:04.589

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:06.324
UPSIDE DOWN BUDGETS ULTIMATELY

00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:09.261
RESULT IN A LACK OF CASH.

00:22:09.327 --> 00:22:10.729
IF YOU ARE SPENDING MORE THAN

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:12.364
YOU'RE BRINGING IN BALTIMORE

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:14.166
YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NOT THE BUDGET.

00:22:14.232 --> 00:22:16.268
THE BANK ACCOUNT ITSELF --

00:22:16.334 --> 00:22:18.837
BEGINS TO DRAIN -- INSOLVENCY IS

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:21.206

FOR FOR THIS.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:50.135

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:48.239
LABOR PARTNER -- YOU MUST FILE A

00:26:48.306 --> 00:26:50.608
DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE COSTS OF

00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:52.644
THAT LABOR AGREEMENT ON THE

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.779
TERMS AND THE COST OVER THE TERM

00:26:54.846 --> 00:26:56.648
OF THE AGREEMENT WHETHER IT'S

00:26:56.715 --> 00:26:58.483
ONE YEAR THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS --

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.818
THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE FOR ANY

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:02.721
PUBLIC AGENCY NOT JUST SCHOOLS.

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:05.857
ARM AND IN THE CASE OF SCHOOLS

00:27:05.924 --> 00:27:09.060
THE COUNTY OFFICE THEN -- IS

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:10.195
BECAUSE THE DISTRICT WAS QUALIFY

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.930
THE COUNTY OFFICES GIVEN TEN

00:27:11.997 --> 00:27:13.164
DAYS TO REVIEW.

00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:14.799
THAT SOME MIDDLE AND THEY MUST

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:16.334
RESPOND TO IT THEY DON'T GET TO

00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:18.136
DISAPPROVE THEY CAN COMMENT ON

00:27:18.203 --> 00:27:20.138
IT WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:22.640
SENATOR WAS -- LA COUNTY OFFICES

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:26.511
A LETTER IN RESPONSE TO THAT --

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:28.713
SETTLEMENT THAT RAISED NUMBER OF

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.249
CONCERNS SO I THINK -- DIFFERENT

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:32.884
THAN.

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:35.687
A COUPLE OTHER DISTRICTS -- LA.

00:27:35.754 --> 00:27:39.591
FISCAL ISSUE IS NOT -- TOMORROW.

00:27:39.657 --> 00:27:41.326
IT'S NOT NEXT YEAR THERE FISCAL

00:27:41.393 --> 00:27:43.061
ISSUE RIGHT NOW IS THE AT THE

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:44.496
END OF THE THIRD YEAR OUT

00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:46.031
APPROACH IN THE FOURTH YOUR

00:27:46.097 --> 00:27:46.731
ROUTE.

00:27:46.798 --> 00:27:47.899
AND NOW WILL BECOME VERY

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:49.534
APPARENT WHEN THE DOCTOR BUDGET

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:50.702
IN JUNE.

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:52.237
BECAUSE WHAT IS TODAY THE FOURTH

00:27:52.303 --> 00:27:53.705
YEAR THAT WE'RE NOT REPORTING ON

00:27:53.772 --> 00:27:55.807
BECOMES THE THIRD YEAR THAT IS

00:27:55.874 --> 00:27:57.042
PART OF THE ANALYSIS.

00:27:57.108 --> 00:27:58.343
WHICH IS WHY THE COUNTIES LETTER

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.545
GAVE THEM PER CODE FORTY FIVE

00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:03.415
DAYS TO MAKE BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS --

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:04.482
THAT FORTY FIVE DAYS PAST

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:06.251
THEY'VE NOT ADOPTED THOSE BUDGET

00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:08.119
ADJUSTMENTS YET -- THEY DID

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:10.488
ADOPT A SECOND AN ARM LAST WEEK

00:28:10.555 --> 00:28:11.623
I BELIEVE THEY WERE LATE DOING

00:28:11.689 --> 00:28:14.526
SO -- BUT THEY DID ADOPT ONE IN

00:28:14.592 --> 00:28:19.631
THE ADOPTED AS QUALIFIED.

00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:21.066
SO IS THE IS THE PEDAL TO THE

00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:22.834
METAL IN THE NEXT BUDGET GAS IS

00:28:22.901 --> 00:28:24.035
ISSUED SO IF THEY SUBMIT A

00:28:24.102 --> 00:28:25.937
BUDGET ON JULY ONE TO THE TO LA

00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:27.872
COUNTY OFFICE OF BAD AND IT DOES

00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:30.008
NOT ADDRESS WHAT I EXPECT WILL

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:31.743
BE A BILLION TO TWO BILLION

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.344
DOLLAR DEFICIT IN.

00:28:33.411 --> 00:28:35.146
WHAT WILL BE YOUR THREE THEN THE

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:36.414
COUNTIES CHOICE AT THAT POINT

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:38.083
WOULD BE TO DISAPPROVE THEIR

00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:39.384
BUDGET AND START DOWN THIS

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:40.118
COURSE?

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:42.053
OF EITHER BUDGET REVIEW

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.489
COMMITTEE OR WAVING THAT AND THE

00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:46.724
TWO PARTIES COMING TOGETHER TO

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:50.929
WORK OUT A SOLUTION.

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:51.563
OF FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANNOUNCES

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:53.531
THE TOOL THAT WE USE ON THESE

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:54.332
AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS IT'S A TOOL

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:54.666
THAT.

00:28:54.732 --> 00:28:56.601
HAS DEVELOPED IN USE FOR MANY

00:28:56.668 --> 00:28:57.869
YEARS WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

00:28:57.936 --> 00:29:00.438
THIS PAST SUMMER -- UPDATING AND

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:01.072
IF YOU WILL KIND OF MODERNIZING

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:01.773
IT.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.474
THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.676
QUESTIONS ACROSS TWENTY HIGH

00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:06.444
RISK AREAS OR NOT ALL HIGH RISK

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:07.846
BUT TWENTY RISK AREAS.

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:10.548
WE DO WAIT EACH QUESTION.

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:12.650
ARM BETWEEN HIGH RISK MARKET

00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:13.985
RISK AND LOW RISK AND IT AND

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:16.788
ULTIMATELY -- SCORE THE DISTRICT

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:17.856
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:19.524
QUESTIONS BY THE WAY OR YES OR

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:19.924
NO THEY'RE PRETTY

00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:22.427
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:23.595
WE DON'T ALLOW MAYBE ANSWERS.

00:29:23.661 --> 00:29:25.096
TRULY WE FORCE THE ISSUE IT'S

00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:27.665
YES OR NO -- FOR IT MAY NOT BE

00:29:27.732 --> 00:29:30.502
APPLICABLE BUT THAT WOULD BE FEW.

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:31.936
SO I'VE ALREADY RELEASED GONE

00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:33.638

COUNTY OFFICE OF ADD TO THAT

00:34:08.946 --> 00:34:11.449
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT -- SHE DID

NOT ASK PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:15.586

TEAM HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB --

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.833
HELPING INGLEWOOD -- I THINK --

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.368
IT WAS MADE MORE PROGRESS IN THE

00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:32.069
LAST SIX MONTHS UNDER EIGHTEEN

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:34.071
FORTY THAN THEY HAD MADE IN THE

00:34:34.138 --> 00:34:36.140
PRIOR SIX YEARS -- AND SO I I I

00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:37.575
SEE PROGRESS THERE I THINK WE

00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:39.110
ALL THAT VISIT ON A REGULAR

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:41.045
BASIS SEE PROGRESS AND AND

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:43.848
THAT'S THAT'S GOOD NEWS. ONE OF

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:44.882
THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR WORK

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.251

DISTRICTS DEFICIT PROJECTED

00:34:54.091 --> 00:34:55.793
DEFICIT WOULD BE FOR NEXT YEAR --

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.628
IN OUR PROJECTION FOR INGLEWOOD

00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:59.030
IS A ONE POINT THREE MILLION

00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:01.799
DOLLAR UNDER -- EIGHTEEN FORTY

00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:03.968
IT DOES REQUIRE ACTION IN THE IN

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:07.071
THE NEW NEW BUDGET -- BUT THE

00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:07.738
EIGHTEEN FORTY PROVIDES THAT THE

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:09.073
STATE WOULD -- POTENTIALLY

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.576
APPROPRIATE 75% OF THAT ONE

00:35:11.642 --> 00:35:13.044

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:16.280
ADDITIONAL AID FOR THE DISTRICT

00:35:16.347 --> 00:35:18.115
BASED ON THAT PROJECTION.

00:35:18.182 --> 00:35:20.051
OAKLAND SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STORY

00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:21.118
UNDERSTAND THAT THE

00:35:21.185 --> 00:35:23.020
CIRCUMSTANCES SINGLE IN OAKLAND

00:35:23.087 --> 00:35:24.455
FOR THE LAST YEAR BEEN KINDA

00:35:24.522 --> 00:35:25.690
LUMPED TOGETHER BUT THAT.

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:27.024
THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT ANGLE

00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:28.493
WHAT IS BEING OPERATED.

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:30.127
UP TO LAST OCTOBER BY THE STATE

00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:32.230

HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AUTHORITY --

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:38.669

DAY TO DAY DECISIONS NOW IN

00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:44.141
CONCERT WITH THE COUNTY

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:45.376
SUPERINTENDENT.

00:35:45.443 --> 00:35:46.410
OAKLAND.

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:49.280
GOT ITS EMERGENCY PREPARATION

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:49.914
TWO THOUSAND THREE WENT THROUGH

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:50.781
A PERIOD OF RECOVERY AND

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.216
ULTIMATELY WAS CERTIFIED IS

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:53.851
RECOVERED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:55.753
LOCAL CONTROL WAS AND RETURNED.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.355
BY THE ADMINISTRATION BACK TO

00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:58.923
THE DISTRICT THE BOARD TO GET

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.224
SEATS AGAIN HIGHER TO

00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:01.692
SUPERINTENDENT AND FOR THE LAST

00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:03.027
DECADE THEN THEY'VE BEEN

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:04.962
OPERATING -- WITH A STATE

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:06.230
TRUSTEE LOOKING OVER THEIR

00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:07.265
SHOULDER BUT THEY'VE BEEN

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:08.733
OPERATING AS A VERY TYPICAL

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:10.601
DISTRICT.

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:11.569
THEY A DATA FIGHT THEMSELVES

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:12.904
SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT FISCAL

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.705
DISTRESS I'M JUST OVER A YEAR

00:36:14.772 --> 00:36:16.741
AGO AND WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH

00:36:16.807 --> 00:36:18.943
THEM IT LITERALLY ALMOST DAILY

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.212
SINCE THAT POINT IN TIME -- IN

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:23.014
SEVERAL DIFFERENT ROLES -- BUT

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.049
CERTAINLY UNDER THE ROLE OF

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:25.750
EIGHTEEN FORTY OUR MARCH ONE

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:27.051
LETTERS -- DENTAL VICE THAT

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:28.286
PROGRESS IN THE DISTRICT IS

00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:30.955
INCONSISTENT GOVERNANCE IN

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:31.722
LEADERSHIP HAVE.

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:32.957
DEFICIENCIES I WOULD SAY

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:35.126
SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES IN THE

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:37.695
LAST TWO WEEKS HEIR CFO CHIEF

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:39.063
FINANCIAL OFFICER WALKED OUT.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:40.464
AND THERE'S CHIEF BUSINESS

00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:42.900
OFFICIAL GAVE NOTICE LAST WEEK

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:47.772
TO LEAVE NEXT WEEK -- AND SO I I

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:51.175
WOULD ADD -- OBVIOUSLY A A LEVEL

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:53.811
OF CONCERN -- GIVEN THOSE TWO

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:56.681
VERY IMPORTANT FOLKS -- NOW --

00:36:56.747 --> 00:36:59.517
STEPPING AWAY FROM THE DISTRICT

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:00.851
MY MIKE ME WHAT WHAT HAPPENED

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:03.254
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:04.789
AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN

00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:06.924
AND WHAT THE PROJECTED -- OF

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:09.460
SIZE OF THE DEFICIT.

00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:11.262
TO NOW SO THE PROJECTED SIZE THE

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:13.164
DEFICITS THE EASY ANSWER HARM ON

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.699
MARCH WHEN WE ESTIMATE OUT AT

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:16.233
SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION HOWEVER

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.303
THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE RECENT

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.671
SETTLEMENT WITH THEIR TEACHERS.

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:21.806
YOU'LL RECALL THAT THEY SIGN

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:22.873
THAT TENTATIVE AGREEMENT ON

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.509
MARCH ONE LITERALLY AN HOUR

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:26.577
BEFORE WE ISSUED A REPORT.

00:37:26.644 --> 00:37:28.212
THEY ALSO HAVE ADOPTED SOME

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:29.747
BUDGET CUTS ROUGHLY TWENTY ONE

00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:31.382
MILLION IN BUDGET CUTS SINCE

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:33.818
THAT DATE -- LITERALLY JUST

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:35.453
YESTERDAY THEY SUBMITTED.

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:37.188
THE COST OF THEIR SETTLEMENT I

00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:38.856
THINK WE'RE IT WEEK THREE IT'S

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.024
TAKEN HIM THAT LONG TO FIGURE

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.960
OUT WHAT THEY HAD HAVE AGREED.

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:44.161
TO IT'S NOT TRADITIONAL YOU

00:37:44.228 --> 00:37:46.330
GENERALLY KNOW WHAT IT COSTS

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:49.233
BEFORE YOU AGREE TO IT -- SO THE

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.135
EASY ANSWERS SEVEN POINT SIX

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:52.770
HOWEVER WE WILL NEED TO DO THE

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:54.038
ANALYSIS ON THE DATA THAT WAS

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:55.206
SUBMITTED YESTERDAY.

00:37:55.272 --> 00:37:57.041
AND THE BUDGET CUTS AND WE WILL

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.609
BE UPDATING WITH DEPARTMENT

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.011
FINANCES CONSENT WILL BE

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.612
UPDATING OUR MARCH FIRST REPORT

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.247
HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS.

00:38:03.314 --> 00:38:06.484
THE BIGGER QUESTION SIR IS WHAT

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.185
HAPPENED OVER THAT TEN YEAR

00:38:08.252 --> 00:38:10.488
PERIOD -- I THINK VERY CANDIDLY

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:11.756
ON THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THEY

00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:13.491
SLIPPED RIGHT BACK TO WHERE THEY

00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:17.094
WERE IN -- TWO THOUSAND THREE IN

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.963
ALL CASES SO IN THIRTY YEARS OF

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.499
AB -- TWELVE HUNDRED AND THEN

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:23.234
THE AUDIENCE IS PAUL WORN WITH

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.969
THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:27.004
CALIFORNIA WHO WAS A STAFFER ON

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:28.139
AB TWELVE HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:36.514
AGO -- BUT SORRY PAUL -- AND SO --

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:42.253
THE IN THOSE THIRTY YEARS WE'VE

00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:43.821
HAD NINE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:45.022
ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE KIND OF GO

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:46.724
OFF THE END.

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:49.326
SO I WOULD SAY OF ELEVEN HUNDRED

00:38:49.393 --> 00:38:50.161
DISTRICTS EACH YEAR GOING

00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:51.395
THROUGH THIS PROCESS THE SYSTEM

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:53.798
ACTUALLY WORKS AND IT WORKS WELL.

00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:55.232
WE HAVE VERY FEW NEGATIVES AND

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:56.734
WHEN WE DO WE GET THEM TURNED

00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:58.436
AROUND AND BACK WHERE THEY NEED

00:38:58.502 --> 00:39:01.172
TO BE -- IN OAKLAND'S CASE THEY

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:02.773
HAD A TRUSTEE IN PLACE DURING

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.042
THAT PERIOD OF TIME SERVING --

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:06.177
TO ENSURE THE STATE'S INTERESTS

00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:07.678
WERE BEING MET AND THAT IS THAT

00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:09.780
THE ANNUAL REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:13.350
WAS BEING MAY -- BUT IT'S CLEAR

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:15.786
THE DISTRICT MISLED THAT TRUSTEE --

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:16.353
AND THAT THEIR DATA WAS NOT

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.789
ACCURATE -- AND THEY IN THAT

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:23.094
PROCESS HAVE SLID BACK OVER TIME.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.330
AND SO I I WILL TELL YOU IN ALL

00:39:26.397 --> 00:39:27.865
TEN CASES.

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:29.800
AND IN ALL CASES GENERALLY OF

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.635
FISCAL DISTRESS THIS IS A

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:32.703
GOVERNMENT SENT A LEADERSHIP

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.071
ISSUE.

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.440
IT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A FISCAL

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:38.976
PROBLEM USUALLY A DECADE OR MORE

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:40.745
LATER IN IN WHICH CASE IT GOES

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:42.480
BACK ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS A

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:43.614
GOVERNANCE IN A LEADERSHIP ISSUE

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:44.715
THAT TOOK.

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:47.384
ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS OF

00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:49.019
ACCUMULATED ISSUES.

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:50.521
ON THAT AND ALSO WE MANIFEST

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:53.624
ITSELF -- SIX YEARS AGO SEVEN

00:39:53.691 --> 00:39:54.391
QUICK QUESTION.

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:56.193
SO THE TRUSTEE WHO YOU SAID YOU

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.661
FEEL LIKE WAS PROBABLY MISLED BY

00:39:57.728 --> 00:39:59.296
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.

00:39:59.363 --> 00:40:00.564
HOW DO WE PICK OUR TRUSTEES AND

00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:01.832
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO PICK

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:04.568
SOMEONE WHO COULD TELL IF THEY

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:05.669
WERE BEING MISLED?

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:07.505
SO PRIOR TO EIGHTEEN FORTY THE

00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:08.172
TRUSTEE.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.807
WAS APPOINTED BY THE STATE

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:12.009
SUPERINTENDENT SUBSEQUENT

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:12.576
EIGHTEEN FORTY THE TRUSTEES

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:14.145
APPOINTED BY THE COUNTY

00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:15.513
SUPERINTENDENT WITH THE

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:16.747
CONCURRENT TO THE STATE

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:18.315
SUPERINTENDENT AND THE PRESIDENT

00:40:18.382 --> 00:40:19.316
THE STATE BOARD.

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:21.452
AN ADDITIONAL PROVISION EIGHTEEN

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:23.287
FORTY IS AT THAT APPOINTMENT IS

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:27.057
MADE FROM A LIST THAT FIXED MATT.

00:40:27.124 --> 00:40:28.459
A DEN OF VICE AND VETS.

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.127
THAT WOULD BE THE REAL NEW --

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:32.496

NUMBER OF CHECKS AND BALANCES --

I THINK THIS IS ONE OF OUR FEW

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:34.291
CASES WHERE WE DIDN'T SEE THE

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:37.428

PROBABLY A BETTER.

00:42:15.699 --> 00:42:16.800
WAY OF DESCRIBING IT DID THEY

00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:18.135
TAKE THAT DEEPER DIVE AFTER

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:19.670
RECEIVING THE RESPONSES I DO

THIS IMPORTANT HEARING.

00:42:33.317 --> 00:42:34.018
I WONDERED IF YOU COULD GIVE A

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:35.719
LITTLE BIT MORE EXPLANATION OF

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:37.988
HOW THEY WERE MISLED AND WHETHER

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:39.790
OR NOT THESE THAT THESE ACTIONS

00:42:39.857 --> 00:42:42.159
ROSE TO ANY KIND OF CRIMINAL --

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:45.029
POTENTIAL CRIMINAL -- ACTIVITY

00:42:45.095 --> 00:42:51.468
THAT THAT SHOULD BE PROSECUTED.

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:53.103
SO SENATOR ARE ARE WILL LET ME

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.471
ANSWERS ANSWER THE SECOND

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:59.143
QUESTION FIRST -- THE WORK WE

00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:01.712
HAVE DONE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:03.013
WHAT WE COMMONLY FOR TWO IS AN

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.381
EXTRAORDINARY AUDIT WHICH WE

00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:06.350
LOOK AT FRAUD MISAPPROPRIATION

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:07.651
OF PUBLIC FUNDS.

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:10.287
OR OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES --

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:12.156
OUR REPORT ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED A

00:43:12.222 --> 00:43:14.858
NUMBER OF CONCERNS -- BUT IT IS

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.226
ULTIMATELY UP TO THE COUNTY

00:43:16.293 --> 00:43:17.828
SUPERINTENDENT TO CALL FOR THAT

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:19.463
REVIEW BASED ON A SET OF

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.566
ALLEGATIONS -- BEFORE WE WOULD

00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:25.436
DO THAT TYPE OF WORK -- AND SO

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:27.104
AND EVEN WHEN WE DO THAT WORK WE

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.505
WOULDN'T MAKE THAT ULTIMATE

00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:30.741
DETERMINATION WE WOULD IDENTIFY.

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:32.309
EVIDENCE THAT WOULD THEN WE

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:33.377
WOULD TURN OVER TO LAW

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:36.714
ENFORCEMENT FOR THEM TO ACT UPON --

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.682
THERE WERE.

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:40.751
A NUMBER OF PRACTICES IN PLACE

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:43.954
THAT WE THINK WERE MISLEADING.

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:46.390
THAT BEST WHERE THERE WAS --

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:49.193
EXTENSIVE INTER FUND BORROWING

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:49.693
THAT WAS NOT RECORDED IS

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.061
BORROWING.

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:53.263
SO MONEY TAKEN FROM ARE NOT

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:54.665
TAKEN STOP APPROPRIATE TERM

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:57.601
MONEY TRANSFERRED FROM.

00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:59.336
SELF INSURED FUNDS TO THE

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:01.205
GENERAL FUND TO HELP BOOST UP

00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:04.575
THE GENERAL FUND STATUS -- FROM --

00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:05.909

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.511
THIS CALL HEALTH STANDPOINT.

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:10.414
AND THOSE LOANS IF YOU WILL I'M

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:11.648
USING THE WORD LONG.

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.517
YOU KNOW FAIRLY BROADLY HERE ON

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:15.052
THAT TRANSFER LONG WAS THAT

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:17.087
TRANSFER WAS NOT RECORDED AS A

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:18.756
LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND.

00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:20.491
WHICH ONE DID THEN HAVE SHOWN UP

00:44:20.557 --> 00:44:23.160
ON A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL REPORTS

00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:26.764
IS THE GENERAL FUND HAVING DEBT.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.632
YEAH HE'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:30.200
ACCOUNTING SO BUT BUT WHAT WHAT

00:44:30.267 --> 00:44:32.236
FOR WHAT PURPOSE TO THOSE THOSE --

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:34.338
THOSE ACTIONS TAKEN TO MANAGE

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:36.540
YOUR MUST A MORE ROBUST BALLOT

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:37.341
SHE WHICH MEANS THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:38.075
TO MAKE OTHER.

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:39.743
MORE DIFFICULT YOU KNOW

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:40.911
FINANCIAL DECISIONS RIGHT.

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:43.447
A MORE ROBUST FUND BALANCE NOT

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:46.450
BALLOT SHE BUT FUND BALANCE FOR

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.085
THE GENERAL FUND.

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:49.353
THESE ARE FISCAL OFFICERS OF THE

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.121
DISTRICT.

00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:52.856
WELL AND WHAT MOTIVATION WHEN

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:55.692
THEY HAVE TO DO SUCH A THING --

00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:58.095
SIMPLY TO HAVE THE DISTRICTS

00:44:58.162 --> 00:44:59.029
FISCAL HEALTH WORK BETTER THAN

00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:01.498
IT WAS.

00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:03.067
THIRD THERE IS ACTUALLY NO

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:04.868
ALLEGATION OR EVIDENCE OF ANY

00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:06.437
PERSONAL GAIN.

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:08.472
IN IN ANYTHING WORK THAT WE'VE

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:09.873
DONE IN THE DISTRICT COURT ANY.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.241
CONVERSATION WE HAVE ALMOST A

00:45:11.308 --> 00:45:13.444
WEEKLY IN FACT WE'RE PART OF A

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:14.011
WEEKLY CONVERSATION IN THE

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:14.878
DISTRICT.

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.814
NEVER HAS THERE BEEN AN

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.648
ALLEGATION OF ANY QUE.

00:45:17.714 --> 00:45:18.515
ARE THOSE EMPLOYEES STILL

00:45:18.582 --> 00:45:20.551
EMPLOYED BY THE DISTRICT THE

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:22.653
MAIN ONE IS NOT NOW.

00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:26.290
THEY WERE -- CONTRACT WAS BOUGHT

00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:28.025
OUT ROUGHLY A YEAR AGO BUT HE ME

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:29.560
YOU MEAN THE INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:32.329
OR A CONTRACT OR NO THE AND IN

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:33.063
AN EMPLOYEE.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.698
THIS EMPLOYEE HAD A CON AN

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:35.899
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT.

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:37.267
AND WHY WOULD EMPLOYEE OF THE

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:38.135
DISTRICT HAVE EMPLOYMENT

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:39.903
CONTROVERSY SENIOR EXECUTIVE

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:42.106
STAFF HAVE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS

00:45:42.172 --> 00:45:43.841
THREE YEAR SUPERINTENDENT FAIRLY

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:45.008
TYPICAL TO HAVE A THREE YEAR

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.276
CONTRACT AS AN EXAMPLE.

00:45:46.343 --> 00:45:47.578
THE MOST OF THESE ACTIONS WITHIN

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:49.746
THE ACCOUNTING FUNCTION HAVE A

00:45:49.813 --> 00:45:50.948
CHECK AND BALANCE TO THEM RIGHT.

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:52.816
SO THAT NO ONE PERSON EVER CAN

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:55.452
MAKE A DECISION WITHOUT SOMEBODY

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:56.587
ELSE HAVING ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT.

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:58.055
SO WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT

00:45:58.122 --> 00:45:59.056
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE PERSON

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:00.591
INVOLVED THAT MEANS THAT AT

00:46:00.657 --> 00:46:01.792
LEAST ONE PERSON INVOLVED IN

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:03.794
THIS FRAUD.

00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:06.697
I STILL EMPLOYED BY THE DISTRICT.

00:46:06.763 --> 00:46:07.431
SO I WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT

00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:09.933
THE TERM FRAUD I THINK IF WE

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.602
WERE TO LOOK AT THE PENAL CODE

00:46:11.668 --> 00:46:12.903
IT'S THAT THERE'S SOME PERSONAL

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.638
GAIN AND AGAIN THERE'S BEEN NO

00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:16.006
ALLEGATIONS OF THAT.

00:46:16.073 --> 00:46:18.175
IS THERE A SIZEABLE BUSINESS

00:46:18.242 --> 00:46:20.644
OFFICE TEAM IN THE DISTRICT AND

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:24.348
HAS BEEN YES -- THERE STILL IS --

00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:26.917
A SIZEABLE STAFF THERE I'M DOING

00:46:26.984 --> 00:46:29.353
A TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONS.

00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:31.555
THE EXAMPLE OF THE INTER FUND

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.991
TRANSFERS I WOULD SAY WAS DONE

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:36.693
AND VERY VERY HIGH LEVEL DIDN'T

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.261
INVOLVE A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER

00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:37.628
PEOPLE.

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:39.963
I THANK YOU.

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:41.532
LET ME ASK A QUESTION ON THE

00:46:41.598 --> 00:46:43.333
AUDIT IS THE IS THE AUDIT

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:47.037
CONTRACT CHANGED.

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:48.539
I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT --

00:46:48.605 --> 00:46:49.373
BECAUSE THE AUDIT THE

00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:50.807
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR WOULD

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:52.943
REPRESENT THE REPORT NOT TO THE

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.212
SUPERINTENDENT OR TO TO SENIOR

00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:56.613
MANAGEMENT TEAM TO THE LORD.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.283
SO THE FAILURE OF THE AUDIT TEAM.

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:01.585
TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY WHETHER IT

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:03.887
WAS INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE.

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:08.258
THESE -- DISCREPANCIES --

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:10.294
POTENTIALLY PRECLUDED THE BOARD

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.296
FROM HAVING THE INFORMATION.

00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:13.997
YES SIR OR THE TRUSTEE IN THIS

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:16.066
CASE THE INFORMATION NECESSARY

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:17.401
TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION

00:47:17.467 --> 00:47:18.936
BECAUSE YES SIR AND IT GOES

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:20.370

BUT COMPLETELY INSUFFICIENT TO

00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:17.687
ULTIMATELY TURNED THE CORNER BUT

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.055
IT'S THE RESULT OF THOSE INITIAL

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:20.624

SALARIES OR VARIOUS THINGS. TO

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:49.919
BE FAIRLY SIMPLE ABOUT IT NUMBER

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:50.687
ONE THERE'S THERE'S A LONG

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:52.722
HISTORY IN THE DISTRICT --

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:55.558
PROBABLY OF INACTION -- WITHIN

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:56.893
DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE ITEMS

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.129
BUT REALLY THE THE CURRENT ISSUE

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:02.165
IS DRIVEN BY -- THE DISTRICT

00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:03.366
ENTERING INTO A COLLECTIVE

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:05.268
BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH ITS --

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:09.539
TEACHER PARTNERS IN NOVEMBER OF

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:10.840
SEVENTEEN WE ARE -- NOT IN A

00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:12.542
POSITION IN ANY WAY TO CRITICIZE

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:13.977
THAT AGREEMENT WE GENERALLY

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:15.478
WOULD SAY AND WE'D SAY THE SAME

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:17.213
THING ABOUT OAKLAND'S WOULD SAY

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.548
THE SAME THING ABOUT L. A.'S.

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.216
IF THAT'S WHAT THE RIGHT THE

00:55:20.283 --> 00:55:21.651
TERMS OF THAT AGREEMENT WERE THE

00:55:21.718 --> 00:55:23.053
RIGHT THINGS FOR THE DISTRICT

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:24.654
AND IT'S IN THIS CASE TEACHERS.

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.289
WHO LET'S BE HONEST DO MOST OF

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:27.824
THE WORK IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO

00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:29.626
ALMOST ALL THE WORK IN A SCHOOL

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.127
DISTRICT?

00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:33.196
THEN THAT'S THE RIGHT THING --

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:35.432
BUT WHEN YOU AGREE TO THOSE

00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:38.201
TERMS AND AS A BOARD APPROVED

00:55:38.268 --> 00:55:38.835
THOSE KNOWING YOU CAN'T AFFORD

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:40.503
ON THEN THE SUBJECT YOU HAVE

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:42.505
SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS THAT YOU NEED

00:55:42.572 --> 00:55:43.273
TO TAKE.

00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:44.941
BOARD MEMBERS A FIDUCIARY IS FOR

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:46.342
THEIR DISTRICT THAT'S THE ROLE

00:55:46.409 --> 00:55:47.610
AS TRUSTEES.

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:49.479
AND IN THIS DISTRICTS CASE THEY

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:50.947
APPROVE THE AGREEMENT KNOWING

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:52.182
THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

00:55:52.248 --> 00:55:53.917
AND THAT IS NOW ROUGHLY A YEAR

00:55:53.983 --> 00:55:55.652
AND A HALF LATER AND THEY'RE

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:58.188
JUST NOW STARTING. TO MAKE THE

00:55:58.254 --> 00:56:00.123
NECESSARY CUTS ASSOCIATE TO THAT

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.092
WHAT'S THE DELTA.

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:07.163
THE DELTA A NATIONALLY IS IN THE

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.832
THAT A FAIR QUESTION YES IT IS

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.567
AND I SHOULD KNOW THE ANSWER.

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:12.235
ALTHOUGH IT I THINK HAS CHANGED

00:56:12.302 --> 00:56:14.337
RECENTLY MICHELLE THE RECALL THE

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:15.672
FIRST YEAR.

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:18.241
IT MOVES UP INTO THE SIXTY

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:19.409
MILLION RANGE OVER THREE YEARS.

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:22.345
YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST YEAR.

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:23.580
YEAH IT'S PRETTY HIGH HIGH

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:25.215
THIRTIES LOW FORTIES IN THE

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:28.418
FIRST YEAR AND THEN ESCALATES UP.

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:29.152
TO SIXTY IN THE THIRD YEAR SO

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.186
THE CONCEPT IS IF YOU APPROVE AN

00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:31.121
AGREEMENT LIKE THAT THEN YOU

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:33.123
NEED TO MAKE THIRTY TO SIXTY

00:56:33.189 --> 00:56:34.124
MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CUTS

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.459
ELSEWHERE YES AND THOSE HAVEN'T

00:56:36.526 --> 00:56:37.727
BEEN MAY THOSE HAVEN'T BEEN MADE.

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:39.929
ONLY A SMALL PORTION JUST IN THE

00:56:39.996 --> 00:56:44.300
LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE --

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:45.835

GO THROUGH ALL THOSE STEPS THEY

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:29.412

AGREEMENT.

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:45.381
BASICALLY WOULD BE TO USE THE

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:48.117
SAVINGS BY ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:49.585

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.292
DIFFICULT TO DO -- BUT TO GO

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:04.761
BACK AND SAY WELL WHAT WITH THE

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.963
TRUSTEES -- THINKING.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:10.600
WHEN THEY MADE THAT AGREEMENT?

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:11.367
WELL.

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:12.602
I CAN'T SPECULATE ON WHAT THEY

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:13.903
WERE THINKING WHAT I CAN SHARE

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:17.607
WITH YOU IS THAT IT WAS VERY.

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:18.741
IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THEY

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:20.109
COULDN'T AFFORD THE AGREEMENT

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.677
THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT.

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.613
DID A REVIEW OF THE DISCLOSURE

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:24.747
THE GRAMINIS REQUIRED BY LAW

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:26.182
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT STOOD AT

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:27.517
THE PODIUM IN THE BOARD ROOM AND

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:30.053
SAID AHEAD OF THEIR APPROVAL

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:31.254
AGREEMENT YOU CANNOT AFFORD THIS.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.755
SHORTLY THERE AFTER THEIR FIRST

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:34.090
IN ARMOR PORT.

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:35.992
ON THE DATA REFLECTED THEY COULD

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:37.760
AFFORD IT SUBSEQUENT.

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:40.063
SECOND IN A REPORT A YEAR AGO

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:40.963
THEY COULDN'T.

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.931
THAT SAME INFORMATION WAS

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:44.100
AVAILABLE WHAT IT DID IS IT LEFT

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:45.034
THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT NO

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:46.469
CHOICE IT WHEN THEY SUBMITTED

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.004
THE BUDGET FOR THE CRRENT YEAR.

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:49.672
LAST JUNE.

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:50.673
THAT'S WHEN THE COUNTY

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.141
SUPERINTENDENT SAID I DON'T HAVE

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:54.377
A CHOICE -- I NEED TO DISAPPROVE

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:55.678
YOUR BUDGET.

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:57.280
THAT'S WHAT THEN PUT THEM IN ON

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:59.515
THIS PATH OR THE WE CAME INTO

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:00.983
THE FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.719
AND THERE'S BEEN A DAILY

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:09.092
ENGAGEMENTS -- SEXY.

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:11.094
OKAY -- HARDEST DAY ACTUALLY

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.595
UNDERSTAND ALL THAT I MEAN

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:14.363
PRAGMATICALLY WHY WITH THOSE

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:17.500
CHOICES MADE -- DIFFICULT TO

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.168
UNDERSTAND THANK YOU.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.536
WAS TO FIND GIVEN THE CORE

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:23.973
MISSION OF THE DISTRICT -- IS IT

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.808
POSSIBLE TO CUT SIXTY MILLION

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.076
DOLLARS OUT OF A BUDGET.

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:29.011
TO RIGHT THE SHIP.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.313
BEEN EASIER IF THEY'D START A

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:32.048
YEAR AND A HALF AGO -- VERY

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.382
CANDIDLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A

01:02:33.449 --> 01:02:34.750
SMALLER NUMBER AND EVERY CUT

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:36.953
WOULD HAVE HAD MORE OF AN IMPACT

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:39.856
WITH RESPECT TO THE BOTTOM LINE --

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:41.724
THIS IS NOT A SMALL DISTRICTS

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.726
GOOD SIZED DISTRICT OBVIOUSLY.

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:45.895
SIXTY MILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY --

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:47.396
LARGE PERCENTAGE.

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:48.998
THEY CAN ONLY DO THAT WITH THEIR

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:51.067
PARTNERS AND THAT WOULD NOT ONLY

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.535
BE THE TEACHERS BUT ALL OF THEIR

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:56.672
LABOR PARTNERS -- IN AGREEING --

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:57.840
TO SOME TYPE OF DIFFERENT

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.509
WHETHER THAT'S CLASS SIZE

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:01.844
WHETHER IT'S STAFFING RATIOS OF

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:02.879
SOME KIND.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:04.313
ON THE DISTRICT IF I RECALL

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:08.818
SPENDS THE BETTER PART OF 90% --

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:10.386
ALL OF THEIR BUDGET ON SALARIES

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.654
AND BENEFITS.

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:12.822
MORE TYPICAL DISTRICTS RUNS

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:15.091
ABOUT 85% A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.826
BALANCE THERE THAT THEY CAN WORK

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:18.895
WITH NON SALARIES AND BENEFITS.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:22.665
IN THIS CASE THOUGH -- THERE --

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:27.136
MOST SIGNIFICANT -- OPPORTUNITY

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:28.471
TO DO SOMETHING WOULD BE WITH

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:29.505
HOURS OF THAT OFFICE AND THE

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:31.140
REASON I ASK THE QUESTION IS

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:32.742
THAT THE IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE.

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:34.377
ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE ARE

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:34.911
CONCERNED.

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:36.479
FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF SCHOOL

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:38.347
DISTRICTS NOT THE NATURE OF

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:40.349
BENEFITS THAT THEY THE DISTRICT

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:41.918
NEGOTIATES FOR ITS TEACHERS.

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:42.885
BUT WHETHER RATHER DO THEY

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.520
NEGOTIATE FOR A CERTAIN SET OF

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:45.922
BENEFITS IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:48.491
OVER OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH.

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:49.725
AND ARE THERE IS THE DISTRICT

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:50.793
WILLING TO MAKE WHATEVER CUTS

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.995
ARE NECESSARY TO SATISFY THE

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:54.363
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:55.831
YES MY QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:57.567
YOU CAN ACTUALLY CUT SIXTY

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:58.834
MILLION DOLLARS OF THE SCHOOL

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:01.737
DISTRICT BUDGET AND DELIVER RUN

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.339
YOUR CORE -- FUNCTION WHICH IS

01:04:03.406 --> 01:04:04.907
TO EDUCATE.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.142
YOUNG PEOPLE IN CASE YOU TWELVE

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:07.777
IF I IMPLIED ANYTHING OTHER THAN

01:04:07.843 --> 01:04:09.879
THAT THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:11.514
DO HI.

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.216
WOULDN'T THAT WOULD BE WRONG IT

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:15.551
IS A DIFFICULT THING TO DO.

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:16.686
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE

01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:18.020
MAJORITY OF ELEVEN HER SCHOOL

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:19.455
DISTRICTS OUT THERE FACE THESE

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:22.391
KINDS OF DECISIONS EACH DAY

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.960
THEIR BOARDS ULTIMATELY STEP UP

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:26.729
FROM PRIORITIZE -- YOU KNOW

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.264
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO NUMBER

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:29.765
THREE HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:30.333
THAT'S WHAT THEY SPEND THEIR

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:33.302
MONEY ON AND THEY HAVE TO LET

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.938
SOME OTHER PRIORITIES GO --

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:37.840
RIGHT THE CONCERN HERE IS THE

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:39.342
LENGTH OF TIME.

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:40.743
THE KNOWLEDGE NUMBER ONE THAT

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.211
THEY HAD GOING IN.

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:43.679
THE LENGTH OF TIME IT'S TAKEN TO

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:47.183
ACT -- THE RELATIONSHIP THIS IS

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.919
US THIS IS A INDUSTRY IF I CAN

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:51.887
USE THAT TERM A BUSINESS THAT IS

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.990
BUILT ON RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT.

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.491
STARTS WITH THE STUDENT AND THE

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:57.326
TEACHER THE ADULT THAT THEY'RE

01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:57.827
INTERACTING WITH IN THE

01:04:57.893 --> 01:05:00.263
CLASSROOM -- ON THE FIELD THAT

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.030
RELATIONSHIP IS CRITICALLY

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:02.865
IMPORTANT IT MOVES ALL THE WAY

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.767
THROUGH ALL OF THE LEVELS OF A

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:05.868
SCHOOL DISTRICT AND FUNCTIONS OF

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:06.802
A SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:05:06.869 --> 01:05:08.504
ULTIMATELY COMING TO THE BOARD

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:10.106
AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:14.343
THEIR LABOR PARTNERS -- AND

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:15.544
THAT'S NOT A RELATION.

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:16.646
CURRENTLY NOT A WORKING

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:20.349
RELATIONSHIP -- WITH THE

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:21.917
TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THERE'S A

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:23.552
STRONGER WORKING RELATIONSHIP

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:25.021
WITH THEIR OTHER.

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:26.289
LABOR PARTNERS IN THE DISTRICT

01:05:26.355 --> 01:05:27.657
BUT WE CERTAINLY CERTAINLY KNOW

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:28.891
AROUND HERE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.326
TO CUT.

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:31.794
THE OTHER DECISIONS ARE A LITTLE

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.297
EASIER BUT CUTTING IS THE MOST

01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:35.564
DIFFICULT THINGS DIFFUSER GLAZER

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:37.366
OR JUST ANOTHER ONE MORE FOLLOW

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:38.134
UP -- AND I KNOW WHAT THIS WILL

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.135
BE A DIFFICULT QUESTION FOR YOU

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:41.237
BUT SO YOU'VE IDENTIFIED WHAT

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:43.072
APPEARS TO BE IRRESPONSIBLE

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.674
CONDUCT ON THE BACK HALF OF THE

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.941
TRUSTEES TO MAKE AN AGREEMENT

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:47.643
THAT THEY THEN DID NOT TO TAKE

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:51.147
THE ACTIONS NECESSARY. TO TO

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.015
PERFORM KEEP THE DISTRICT

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.517
FISCALLY SOFT RICE THE ACTIONS I

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:56.118
WOULD FOR THE SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS

01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:58.087
THAT I WOULD FOCUS ON SO WELL.

01:05:58.154 --> 01:06:02.124
ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD

01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:02.992
HAVE AN POLICY OR LAW.

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:04.026
THAT CAN HELP THIS TYPE OF

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:04.827
CIRCUMSTANCE TOOLS THAT.

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:06.495
THAT YOU DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:08.097
THAT WE NEED TO STOP THIS TYPE

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:09.398
OF IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR GOING

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:14.270
FORWARD.

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:16.238
SENATOR IT IT'S NOT RARE THAT

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.506
THIS HAPPENS IT HAPPENS PROBABLY

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:19.342
MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WE WOULD

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:20.676
ALL ACKNOWLEDGE.

01:06:20.743 --> 01:06:22.511
HOWEVER MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:24.347
STEP UP AND ULTIMATELY DO WHAT

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:25.981
THEY NEED TO DO WHICH IS WHY WE

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.249
DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT RIGHT.

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:28.984
INTERN INTO AN AGREEMENT THAT IS

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:30.853
THE RIGHT THING AGREE TO THROUGH

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.888
THE PROCESS AT THE TABLE -- AND

01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:34.523
FOLLOWING THE TENANTS OF WHETHER

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:35.958
IT'S TRADITIONAL BARGAINING OR

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:38.227
INTEREST BASED BARGAINING -- AND

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:39.195
GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:41.397
OBVIOUSLY ARE VERY CRITICAL --

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:42.264
AND SOMETIMES.

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:43.599
AGREEMENTS REACH THAT ARE IN THE

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.534
BEST INTEREST OF ALL THE PARTIES

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:47.436
HOPEFULLY MAINLY THE STUDENTS

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:50.906
THAT WE'RE ALL HERE TO SERVE --

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:53.209
AND AND SOME ADJUSTMENTS HAVE TO

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:54.877
BE MADE MOST SPORTS STEP UP AND

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:56.846
MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS -- DAY

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:59.348
AFTER DAY AFTER DAY -- SO IN

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:01.550
ANSWER TO A QUESTION WE WOULD BE.

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:02.618
CRAFTING SOME TYPE OF

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.721
LEGISLATION OR CONTROL FOR A

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:09.191
VERY FEW FOLKS -- THE COUNTY

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:12.495
SUPERINTENDENT -- I MAYBE IN

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:14.263
THIS CASE IT WOULDN'T BE.

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:15.698
SOME ADDED AUTHORITY FOR FIX

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:17.099
MATTER WOULD BE ADDED AUTHORITY

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.768
FOR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS WHO

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:20.269
ARE CHARGED WITH THE REVIEW THE

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:22.037
BUDGET IN A REPORT AND THE

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:22.972
REVIEW.

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:25.307
OF THE ANALYSIS DONE ON A THE

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:26.909
DISCLOSURE AROUND THE COLLECTIVE

01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:28.010
BARGAINING PROCESS SO

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:29.712
STRENGTHENING THAT PROCESS MAY

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:32.148
BE AN OPPORTUNITY -- WITH

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:33.516
RESPECT TO THE COUNTY

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:35.151
SUPERINTENDENTS ROLE -- BUT IN

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.318
THIS CASE I HAVE TO SAY THE

AND BEST PRACTICES IN THIS AREA

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:38.961
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ON

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:41.063
THAT THE THERE ARE.

01:16:41.129 --> 01:16:44.866

THEIR RETIREES GET BENEFITS.

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:01.883
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE THAT WHICH

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:02.651
HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED SOME OF

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:04.453
THESE CASES IS.

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:05.687
SIGNIFICANT MORE GENEROUS THAN

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:07.022
WHAT IS CURRENTLY OFFERED BY THE

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:10.959
EXISTING -- INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:13.428
EVERYBODY AND THAT'S FINE BUT

01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:15.230
YOU KNOW WHAT.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:16.665
WHAT WHAT THE DISTRICT CAN DO I

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:17.699
WOULD PRESUME IS PURCHASED LIKE

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:18.867
A SUPPLEMENT?

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:19.301
THAT WOULD GET THEM

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:22.371
SUBSTANTIVELY UP TO THE LEVEL OF

01:17:22.437 --> 01:17:24.673
WHATEVER WAS NEGOTIATED.

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.908

SAME TIME STILL OFF LOAD A

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:30.345
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COST

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:33.081
ON TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:34.616
STATE GOVERNMENT WHOEVER ELSE.

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:36.184
IT IS OUT THERE THE TOPPING TO

01:17:36.251 --> 01:17:37.419
FUND THESE PROGRAMS.

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.221
I'M ARE YOU SEE SO CAN YOU TALK

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:41.189
ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BETTER AS A

01:17:41.256 --> 01:17:42.491
AS A WAY OF SAVING MONEY FOR

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:43.158
SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY THE WAY THAT

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:44.893
WE JUST WE TAKE ALL THE SAVINGS

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.728
WE ROLL IT INTO.

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:48.263
YOU KNOW DECREASING CLASS SIZE

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.898
AND HAVING MORE TEACHERS PAYING

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:52.067
TEACHERS BETTER WHAT THEY

DISTRICTS THAT ARE UTILIZING

01:17:57.773 --> 01:17:59.875
THIS AS A AS A AS A YOUR GOOD

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:01.076
PRACTICES THIS BEING LOOKED AT

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:03.178
AS A POTENTIAL WAY OF TRYING TO

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:04.646
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE SERIOUS.

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:06.248
FINANCIAL CHALLENGES THAT ON THE

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:07.249
DISTRICTS THAT ARE MOST

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:08.483
DISTRESSED THAT ARE NOW HAVING

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:10.419
SERIOUS LABOR.

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:12.421
UNREST ARE FACING.

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.790
THE SENATOR -- I I WON'T BE THE

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:15.891
EXPERT TO BE ABLE TO STE TELL

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:17.692
YOU KIND OF WHAT THE TRENDING IS

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:18.760
OUT THERE HOW MANY DISTRICTS ARE

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:20.362
DOING IT BUT THE EXACT THING

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:21.797
THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED ABOUT

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:23.398
PARTNERING WITH PRE EXISTING

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:25.167
PROGRAMS AND PAIN.

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:26.301
IF YOU WILL THE SUPPLEMENT OR

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:28.103
THE DIFFERENCE INCLUDING FOR THE

PRESCRIPTION DRUG SUPPLEMENT AND

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:31.873
AND SO ON FOR EXAMPLE IN A

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.942
MEDICARE IS A FAIRLY COMMON

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:35.777
PRACTICE FOR YOUR POST

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.846
EMPLOYMENT WERE BENEFITS ARE

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:41.016

ELIGIBLE RIGHT -- AS AN EXCUSE

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:45.020
ME MEDICARE'S AN EXAMPLE THAT'S

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:46.955
A FAIRLY COMMON PRACTICE -- I

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:49.391
THINK AND IT DOES SAVE

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:51.560
CONSIDERABLE MONEY -- FOR THOSE

01:18:51.626 --> 01:18:53.562
DISTRICTS THAT THE FEW THAT ARE

01:18:53.628 --> 01:18:55.030
LEFT THAT OFFER LIFETIME

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:57.766
BENEFITS -- GENERALLY THAT'S

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.234
PROBABLY NOT THE APPROACH

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:01.303
THEY'RE TAKING THOSE LIFETIME

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:03.171
BENEFITS A OFFER AT LEAST THE

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:04.573
EMPLOYEE.

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:07.042
MAYBE NOT ALL PFAM NOT MAYBE NOT

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.977
SPOUSE SIM KIDS AT THAT POINT

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:10.212
ARE PART OF THE OTHER DEPENDENTS

01:19:10.278 --> 01:19:11.379
ARE PART OF THE PICTURE.

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:15.817
BUT THE SPOUSE -- GENERALLY

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:16.985
OFFER A PARTICULAR ACCESS TO A

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:19.588
PLAN IT MAY BE A NOT UNCOMMON TO

01:19:19.654 --> 01:19:22.390
SAY THE LOWEST COST PLAN WE THE

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:23.425
DISTRICT WILL PAY.

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:25.527
UPON RETIREMENT THE LOWEST COST

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:28.196
PLAN AND IF YOU WANT TO PAY UP.

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:30.866
TO SAY PPO YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:32.601
THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT SO THOSE

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:34.369
THOSE ARRANGEMENTS ABSOLUTELY DO

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:36.438
EXIST ARE THEY THE MAJORITY OF

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:37.973
THE ARRANGEMENTS LIKE I CAN'T

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:43.178
SPEAK TO THAT -- I GIVE YOU A

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:45.046
NUMBER THAT I A WAS.

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:47.983
THAT I SAW IN THE ANALYSIS THAT

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:50.418
WE WERE DOING -- IN LA DURING

01:19:50.485 --> 01:19:52.521
THEIR LABOR DISPUTE -- IF I

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:53.922
RECALL CORRECTLY I DON'T HAVE IN

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:54.689
FRONT OF ME.

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:57.959
THEIR CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREES

01:19:58.026 --> 01:20:00.695
WAS IN THE EIGHT TO NINE

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:01.997
THOUSAND DOLLARS RANGE COMPARED

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:05.867
TO AN ACTIVE EMPLOYEE AND

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:06.401
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THOUSAND

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:07.068
ACTUALLY WAS HIGHER THAN THAT I

01:20:07.135 --> 01:20:07.669
BELIEVE.

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:09.905
RANGE AND SO THAT TO ME THAT

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:11.339
DIFFERENCE IN CONTRIBUTION WOULD

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:13.308
BE EVIDENCE OF EXACTLY WHAT

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:15.744
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- MAYBE

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:16.645
NOT QUITE THE DIFFERENCE YOU

01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:18.346
WERE YOU WERE THINKING THERE

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:19.114
WOULD BE BUT THAT WOULD BE

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:20.849
EVIDENCE THAT YOU WERE WITH THAT

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:22.384
THAT WAS IN AS LA.

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:25.387
WHICH HAS OUR LARGEST OPEN A

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:26.821
LIABILITY.

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:28.890
AMONG SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:29.958
SO IS THERE A IS THERE AN

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:31.159
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO AND WHAT

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:31.793
WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE STATE OF

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:32.727
PLAY TO ADDRESS I MEAN THIS

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:34.529
SEEMS TO BE OF OF A RELATIVE I

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.064
MEAN OF ALL THE DIFFICULT

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:37.766
DECISIONS AT ALL UC'S GONNA HAVE

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:38.433
TO FACE.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.570
THIS SEEMS LIKE A RELATIVELY.

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:44.206
PAINLESS WAY OF ADDRESSING THEIR

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:45.407
LONG TERM LIABILITIES IN A WAY

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:48.210
THAT DOESN'T -- DOESN'T

01:20:48.276 --> 01:20:50.946
SUBSTANTIVELY IMPACT THE QUALITY

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:53.715
AND SERVICE OF BENEFITS PROVIDED

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:58.320
TO THOSE RETIREES.

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.322
SO I I I WOULDN'T IN ANY WAY

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:02.324
DISAGREE WITH YOU -- I THINK

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:03.725
IT'S THOUGH A TAD MORE

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:07.229
COMPLICATED SO IN LA'S CASE --

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:08.530
AND I BELIEVE THIS APPLIES TO

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:11.199
THEIR RETIREES -- BENEFITS

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:12.801
AROUND -- I'M SORRY DECISIONS

01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:14.169
AROUND HEALTH BENEFITS ARE MADE

THIS ISN'T SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:52.500

01:28:01.275 --> 01:28:02.944
IT WOULD HAVE TO GO TO A TWENTY

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:04.145
FIVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:06.147
INCREASE ABOVE THAT ANNUALLY.

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:08.416
ANNUALLY IF WE BRING THAT INTO

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:12.387
PER PUPIL TERMS -- IT WAS ABOUT

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:13.021
TWELVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND

01:28:13.087 --> 01:28:13.955
FOUR WAS ARE ARE.

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:15.823
A STATEWIDE AVERAGE OPERATING

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:21.295
SPENDING AND THAT WOULD GO UP TO

01:28:21.362 --> 01:28:21.896
SIXTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.464
AND NINETY DOLLARS.

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:24.699
OKAY -- WE ALSO DO DIDN'T STOP

01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:25.900
AT JUST LOOKING AT THE AGGREGATE

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.735
STATEWIDE BUT WE ALSO WANT TO

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:29.871
SEE HOW THE THE THESE ADEQUACY

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:31.439
GAPS THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:33.174
BETWEEN ARE PROJECTED ADEQUATE

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:34.142
COST.

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:35.843
AN ACTUAL SPENDING HOW MIGHT

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.779
THAT VARY ACROSS DIFFERENT

01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:38.279
DISTRICTS WITH DIFFERENT

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:40.014
CHARACTERISTICS SO ONE OBVIOUS

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:43.084
CUT IS WE SPLIT DISTRICTS INTO A

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:45.420
COURT TILES BASED ON THE LEVEL

01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:47.922
OF POVERTY STUDENT POVERTY -- AS

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:50.591
A PROXY BY STUDENT PERCENTAGE OF

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.460
STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:53.995
REDUCED PRICE LUNCH -- AND WHAT

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:56.030
WE FOUND IS THAT THE ADEQUACY

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:56.964
GAP THAT IS THAT DIFFERENCE

01:28:57.031 --> 01:28:58.733
BETWEEN PROJECTED.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.269
ADEQUATE SPENDING AND ACTUAL

01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:02.837
SPENDING WAS LARGEST AS YOU

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:04.005
MIGHT EXPECT IN THOSE HIGHEST

01:29:04.072 --> 01:29:06.107
POVERTY DISTRICTS AND LOWEST IN

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:07.809
IN IN IN THE LOWER PART

01:29:07.875 --> 01:29:09.544
DISTRICTS SO WELL STATE WIDE

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:13.748
WEEK WE ESTIMATED A 38% GAP --

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:15.183
THIS VERY IT'S THE LOW POVERTY

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:16.317
DISTRICTS.

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.820
HAD A GAP OF ABOUT 22% WHERE IS

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:20.054
THE HIGHEST POVERTY DISTRICTS

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:22.423
HAD A GAP ON AVERAGE OF ABOUT

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:25.093
46%.

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:25.293
OKAY.

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:27.962
WE WE WE ALSO DID A CUT BY --

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:30.131
LOCALES SO WE SPLIT UP DISTRICTS

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:34.368
INTO URBAN -- INTO THE URBAN THE

01:29:34.435 --> 01:29:36.337
LARGE TOWNS THE THE THE THE

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:38.272
SMALL TOWNS WILL SUBURB IN SMALL

01:29:38.339 --> 01:29:40.274
TOWNS AND AND RURAL REMOTE

01:29:40.341 --> 01:29:42.910
DISTRICTS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS

01:29:42.977 --> 01:29:44.378
THAT THE RELATIVE.

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:46.380
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADEQUATE AN

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:48.683
ACTUAL SPENDING -- WAS REALLY

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:50.918
HIGHEST AMONGST THE RURAL

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:51.185
DISTRICT.

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:54.555
AND LOWER AMONGST THE THE URBAN

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:54.856
DISTRICTS.

01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:56.591
THE RELATIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:29:56.657 --> 01:29:58.826
WHAT WE PROJECTED AS ADEQUATE.

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:00.194
SPENDING AND WHAT THEY'RE

01:30:00.261 --> 01:30:02.063
ACTUALLY SPENDING.

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.498
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE THAT THAT

01:30:03.564 --> 01:30:05.066
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO TO MAKE

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:05.933
UP TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.268
EDUCATION.

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:08.402
WE GET WE CAN REFER TO THAT AS

01:30:08.469 --> 01:30:09.937
THE ADEQUACY GAP IF YOU WANT.

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:11.305
IT WAS HIGHEST WE'RE IN IN THE

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:13.975
RURAL DISTRICTS ON NOW THERE ARE

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:16.544
FAR FEWER STUDENTS IN RURAL

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:17.779
DISTRICTS THAN IN URBAN

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:18.880
DISTRICTS SO IN.

01:30:18.946 --> 01:30:20.982
AT IN TERMS OF AN ABSOLUTE COST

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:23.384
IT WOULD BE ABOUT THREE BILLION

01:30:23.451 --> 01:30:25.787
OF THAT THAT TWENTY FIVE POINT

01:30:25.853 --> 01:30:26.888
SIX BILLION EXTRA THAT WE WOULD

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:27.822
HAVE TO SPEND.

01:30:27.889 --> 01:30:30.992
WHICH WOULD COVER ALL OF THE

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:32.660
STUDENTS IN THE AND AND THE THE

01:30:32.727 --> 01:30:34.462
RURAL DISTRICTS AND THE SMALL

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:36.030
TOWNS CATEGORY THE MOST RURAL

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:38.466
DISTRICTS IN OUR IN OUR STATE --

01:30:38.533 --> 01:30:39.534
SO THAT THOSE DIFFERENCES REALLY

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.068
QUICKLY THEY THEY WERE NOT A

01:30:41.135 --> 01:30:42.537
STARK AS THE LOW TO THE HIGH

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:45.706
POVERTY CONTRAST THAT I THAT I

01:30:45.773 --> 01:30:46.808
GAVE YOU SO THE BELOW.

01:30:46.874 --> 01:30:49.477
THE LOW HIGH CONTRAST WAS WAS --

01:30:49.544 --> 01:30:51.913
22% AND 46% FOR THE ROAR THE

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:53.781
COMPARISON BETWEEN THE ROLES AND

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:55.383
THE URBAN DISTRICTS.

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:59.387
WAS -- 46406% FOR THE RURAL

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:03.691
DISTRICTS AND 37% FOR THE THEIR

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:04.725
BUSINESSES NOT AS MUCH OF A

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:05.893
CONTRACT AND THIS DOES THAT DOES

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.565
THAT SUGGEST THAT THAT OUR

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:12.867
SYSTEM OF FUNDING THAT WE PUT IN

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:13.467
PLACE A FEW YEARS AGO WITH.

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:14.001
WHICH AT SUPPLEMENTAL IN

01:31:14.068 --> 01:31:15.169
CONCENTRATION GRANT COMPONENTS

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:15.336
IS.

01:31:15.403 --> 01:31:18.172
IS IS EITHER INEFFECTIVE WORKS

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:19.507
TOO SOON TO TELL I DON'T WANT TO

01:31:19.574 --> 01:31:21.075
SAY THAT IT'S INEFFECTIVE BUT WE

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:25.713
DID FURTHER ANALYSIS AND TO TO

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:29.183
TO LOOK AT HOW OUR ADEQUACY

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.252
PROJECTIONS -- WHAT TYPES OF

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:33.487
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SPENDING

01:31:33.554 --> 01:31:35.089
AND POVERTY SPENDING IN SPECIAL

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:36.891
EDUCATION SPENDING IN ENGLISH

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:39.327
LEARNERS -- WHAT ARE PROJECTIONS

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:40.428
WOULD SUGGEST THOSE

01:31:40.494 --> 01:31:42.363
RELATIONSHIPS BUT SHOULD BE ND

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:45.099
THE THE RESULT OF THAT IS REALLY

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:47.935
THAT THE L. C. F. F. IS NOT

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:49.237
AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH?

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:50.571
IN TERMS OF ITS DISTRIBUTIVE

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:51.939
PROPERTIES OR OR OR BEING

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:53.374
PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH SO TO SPEAK

01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:54.408
SO I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT IS

01:31:54.475 --> 01:31:55.376
INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE I DON'T

01:31:55.443 --> 01:31:56.410
THINK THAT IT'S AN EFFECTIVE AT

01:31:56.477 --> 01:31:56.944
ALL.

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:58.813
IT'S JUST -- ACCORDING TO THE

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.548
ADEQUACY MODELS AND CALCULATIONS

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:02.350
THAT WE MADE WE THINK IT COULD

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:04.952
GO FURTHER I'M STILL IN SHOCK AT

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:05.953
TWENTY FIVE POINT SIX BILLION IN.

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:08.122
YEAH NOT THAT I DON'T THINK IT.

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:10.691
IS NEEDED I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:11.592
FIGURE OUT HOW.

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:13.294
HOW TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT IN

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:14.896
TERMS OF OUR STATE BUDGET

01:32:14.962 --> 01:32:17.098
REALITY ABSOLUTELY SO SO THERE

01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:18.332
IS - FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM

01:32:18.399 --> 01:32:20.201
STICKER SHOCK.

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:22.203
WHEN WHEN YOU HEAR THAT FIGURE --

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:24.105
38% IS A LOT AND TWENTY FIVE

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:25.106
POINT SIX BILLION PER ANNUM IS

01:32:25.172 --> 01:32:27.608
IS IS ALSO A LOT SO WHAT WHAT WE

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:29.443
DID IS WE TRY TO PUT INTO THE

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:30.945
NATIONAL CONTEXT.

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:33.547
AND INSTEAD OF SEEING IT AS SUCH

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:35.182
A LARGE INCREASE FOR CALIFORNIA

01:32:35.249 --> 01:32:36.350
WE TRY TO PUT IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:37.985
WHAT OTHER STATES ARE CURRENTLY

01:32:38.052 --> 01:32:39.553
SPENDING AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.789
STATED THAT HAVE BEEN LAUDED AS

01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:43.691
FUNCTIONING REASONABLY WELL.

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:45.927
SO JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEAS

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:48.262
THE ADEQUATE COSTS THAT WE

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:49.397
PROJECTED.

01:32:49.463 --> 01:32:52.199
ARE LESS THAN THE STATE WHAT THE

01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:53.968
STATE'S.

01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:55.036
THE STATE'S WERE CURRENTLY

01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:57.939
SPENDING ON EDUCATION IN TWENTY

01:32:58.005 --> 01:32:58.372
SIXTEEN SEVENTY SO.

01:32:58.439 --> 01:33:00.474
OUR ADEQUACY COSTS WERE 2% LESS

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:02.743
THAN WHAT MASSACHUSETTS WAS

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:03.377
CURRENTLY SPENDING IN THAT SAME

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:05.980
YEAR -- FOR OTHER NORTHEASTERN

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:08.449
DISTRICT IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:09.984
SO FOR VERMONT ARE ADEQUACY

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:12.420
FIGURES WERE 15% LESS THAN THEIR

01:33:12.486 --> 01:33:15.122
ACTUAL SPENDING. FOR NEW JERSEY

01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:18.592
IT WAS 16% CONNECTICUT 17% AND

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:20.928
OUR ADEQUACY FIGURES WERE 28%

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:22.763
LOWER THAN WHAT NEW YORK WAS

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:23.597
SPENDING.

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:26.734
IN THE SAME YEAR ON A PER PUPIL

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:28.602
BASIS THE DO YOU.

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:29.704
DO YOU KNOW WHAT PROCESS HOW THE

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:31.706
PERCENTAGES OF THE OVERALL STATE

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:33.941
BUDGETS IN THOSE STATES -- I

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:35.543
DON'T OFF OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:37.178
BUT I CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU THAT

01:33:37.244 --> 01:33:37.812
INFORMATION IT'S PRETTY EASY TO

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:43.250
FIND -- SO -- I I THINK I MET

01:33:43.317 --> 01:33:43.985
SEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES ALL

01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:45.553
STOP RIGHT THERE BUT I'M I'LL BE

01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:47.855
HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS

01:33:47.922 --> 01:33:48.589
AS WE GO.

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:49.924
ALONG QUESTIONS.

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:50.791
I DIDN'T [inaudible]

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:54.495
FOR OKAY.

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:57.732
SURE -- WHO'S NEXT.

01:33:57.798 --> 01:33:59.467
I AM A SHEET HERE YEAH CORY

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:01.635
COULD L. UNIVERSITY WAS VERY --

01:34:01.702 --> 01:34:02.837
SO I MAY BE TALKING ABOUT -- THE

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:03.504
PENSION ISSUES WITH CALIFORNIA'S

01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:04.972
SCHOOLS THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:07.541
FOR HAVING ME HERE -- I PREPARED

01:34:07.608 --> 01:34:10.344
REMARKS WILL BE NO MINDS AND

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:12.213
SPEND ALL MY TIME SAYING ARM.

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:13.280
UP TO ALL OF YOU MIGHT AT MY

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:14.281
BEST TO BE CONCISE IN MY REMARKS

01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:15.416
FROM THE FOCUS ON CAL STARS

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:16.851
WHICH IS THE PLAN TO COVER

01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:18.352
CERTIFIED PERSONAL THE SCHOOLS

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:18.953
THE THING TEACHERS.

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:19.887
A CLASSIFIED PERSONALS SCHOOLS

01:34:19.954 --> 01:34:20.521
ARE COVERED BY CALPERS.

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:21.756
CALPERS ASSEMBLY STRUCTURE TO

01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:23.391
CAL STAR IS A LOT OF THE SAME

01:34:23.457 --> 01:34:23.958
ISSUES I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:25.659
APPLY -- BUT CALPERS IS A

01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:30.765
SMALLER COST ITEM FOR SCHOOLS.

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:31.298
I THINK WE ALL THE PENSION

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:31.899
CONTRIBUTION RATES ARE RISING

01:34:31.966 --> 01:34:32.566
RAPIDLY IN CALIFORNIA THE RATE

01:34:32.633 --> 01:34:33.934
INCREASES ARE LEGISLATIVE TO BE

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:34.568
HIGHEST FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

01:34:34.635 --> 01:34:35.770
THE STATE.

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:37.405
EMPLOYEES HAVE EXPERIENCED MORE

01:34:37.471 --> 01:34:39.106
MODEST INCREASES.

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:40.608
THE SPECIFICS OF THESE CHANGES

01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:42.043
CAN BE FOUND IN MY REPORT AND

01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:42.843
THE DETAILS ARE ARE WIDELY

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:44.011
AVAILABLE -- WITH THE RATE

01:34:44.078 --> 01:34:44.979
INCREASES A BACKDROP I HAVE

01:34:45.046 --> 01:34:46.247
THREE OBJECTIVES IN THESE BRIEF

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:47.481
COMMENTS FIRST I'M GONNA EXPLAIN

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:49.250
WHY PENSION CONTRIBUTION RATES

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:50.851
ARE RISING IN CALIFORNIA.

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:51.352
THEN I'M GONNA GIVE MY

01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:52.353
ASSESSMENT OF THE LONG TERM

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:53.554
OUTLOOK FOR CAL STARS IN

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:55.256
PARTICULAR IN THE ABSENCE OF

01:34:55.322 --> 01:34:56.690
SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES.

01:34:56.757 --> 01:34:58.159
AND THIRD EMPHASIZING THAT

01:34:58.225 --> 01:34:59.226
CALIFORNIA IS NOT ALONE IN

01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:00.327
EXPERIENCING THESE RISING

01:35:00.394 --> 01:35:02.396
PENSION COSTS I WILL DISCUSS

01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:04.131
POSSIBLE POLICY RESPONSES.

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:07.168
BASED OR OTHER STATES HAVE DONE

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:09.203
IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:10.171
SO WHY IS THIS HAPPENING.

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:11.772
A THE THE SHORT ANSWER IS TWO

01:35:11.839 --> 01:35:12.206
WORDS PENSION THAT.

01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:12.773
IT'S IMPORTANT I CAN I THINK

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:13.674
HOUSES BENEFITS ARE NOT

01:35:13.741 --> 01:35:14.975
IMPROVING WITH THESE RISING

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:16.277
COSTS AND IN FACT NEW TEACHERS

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:18.646
TODAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

01:35:18.712 --> 01:35:19.480
BENEFITS AND THEN.

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:21.749
TEACHERS WHO ARE HIRED BEFORE

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:22.349
TWENTY THIRTEEN I THINK THIS

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:23.784
GIVE SOME CONTEXT FOR THE LABOR

01:35:23.851 --> 01:35:24.819
UNREST IN MANY DISTRICTS.

01:35:24.885 --> 01:35:25.953
DISTRICTS ARE BEING REQUIRED TO

01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:28.089
PAY MORE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES BUT

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:29.290
THE CURRENT EMPLOYEES ARE NOT

01:35:29.356 --> 01:35:32.059
THE BEEFICIARIES OF THESE THESE

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:33.327
HIGHER COSTS.

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:33.961
THE PENSION THAT CAN BE TRACED

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:34.795
TO A VARIETY OF SOURCES BUT I

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:35.830
WILL FOCUS ON JUST TO THAT ARE

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.131
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT.

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:38.699
THAT THERE ARE MANY LAYERS OF

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:39.900
THE PENSION FINANCE ON IN BUT

01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:41.135
WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO ONLY

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:42.736
A HANDFUL OF THINGS MATTER.

01:35:42.803 --> 01:35:43.537
THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.306
CALIFORNIA'S UNDERPAID PENSION

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:46.607
COSTS FOR MANY YEARS.

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:47.942
WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT CALTRANS

01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:49.543
ACTUARIES CALCULATED HOW MUCH

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:51.312
WAS REQUIRED TO PAY FOR FOR

01:35:51.378 --> 01:35:52.513
BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTING

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:55.015
PARTISAN CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:56.517
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE STATE?

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:57.918
I DID NOT PAY THEFULL AMOUNT

01:35:57.985 --> 01:35:58.986
OVER THE YEARS THE UNDERPAYMENT

01:35:59.053 --> 01:36:00.921
A PENSION COSTS HAS RESULTED IN

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:02.423
THE BUILD UP OF SUBSTANTIAL DEBT

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:03.357
THE SAME WAY OF NOT PAYING YOUR

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:04.825
CREDIT CARD BILL MAKE SURE.

01:36:04.892 --> 01:36:06.527
YOU GOT THIS BIG BALANCING USED

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:07.561
A MORE MORE MONEY.

01:36:07.628 --> 01:36:08.796
SECOND THERE IS A CONSENSUS

01:36:08.863 --> 01:36:10.197
AMONG FINANCIAL ECONOMISTS BUT

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:11.265
THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND

01:36:11.332 --> 01:36:12.967
MOST TV PENSION PLANS INCLUDING

01:36:13.033 --> 01:36:13.801
CAL STARS.

01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:15.870
ARE TOO OPTIMISTIC THE MOST

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:16.937
IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION IS THE

01:36:17.004 --> 01:36:17.705
ISSUE AND RATE OF RETURN ON

01:36:17.771 --> 01:36:18.906
ASSETS.

01:36:18.973 --> 01:36:20.141
WHICH FOR ANY PENSION ONCE IN

01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:21.709
THE ROOM IS ALSO THE RATE OF THE

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:23.344
PLAN DISCOUNTS LIABILITIES.

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:24.812
FINANCIAL ECONOMISTS BELIEVE

01:36:24.879 --> 01:36:25.880
THAT THE RATE USED BY CALPERS

01:36:25.946 --> 01:36:26.614
ANOTHER SIMILAR PLANS IS TOO

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.616
HIGH WHICH MEANS THAT EVEN IF

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:30.084
ALL PAYMENTS ARE MADE.

01:36:30.151 --> 01:36:31.585
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO ACCRUE.

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:32.786
ANY EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:35.489
CONSISTENT WITH THIS VIEW AS IN

01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:36.724
STATES WERE FULL PENSION

01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:37.391
PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:39.226
CONSISTENTLY PUBLIC PLAN STILL

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:41.162
CARRY SUBSTANTIAL THAT.

01:36:41.228 --> 01:36:42.129
CONTRIBUTION RATE THE CALIPHATE

01:36:42.196 --> 01:36:43.330
ARISING DATA TODAY TO PAY DOWN

01:36:43.397 --> 01:36:44.298
THE LARGE THAT THAT IS A MASS OF

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:45.099
THE PLAN.

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:46.433
WHICH IS A THE LATEST ACTUARIAL

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.335
VALUATION REPORT IS OVER A

01:36:48.402 --> 01:36:50.771
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS.

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:51.338
THE NEXT IN A GOOD LONG TERM

01:36:51.405 --> 01:36:52.573
OUTLOOK.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.641
WE'RE IN THE PHASE IN PERIOD OF

01:36:53.707 --> 01:36:54.842
HIGHER PENSION CONTRIBUTION RATE

01:36:54.909 --> 01:36:57.778
HAS LEGISLATIVE BY ASSEMBLY BILL.

01:36:57.845 --> 01:36:58.746
FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE IN TWENTY

01:36:58.812 --> 01:36:59.813
FOURTEEN THE TOTAL CONTRIBUTION

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.582
RATE TO CAL STARS AS A PERCENT

01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:02.917
OF TEACHER SALARIES WAS ABOUT

01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:04.251
18%.

01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:05.719
IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR UNDER

01:37:05.786 --> 01:37:06.453
CURRENT PROJECTIONS WHEN THE

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.922
RATES GOING TO PLATEAU IT'LL BE

01:37:07.988 --> 01:37:10.024
AT ABOUT 38% SO.

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:11.692
MORE THAN DOUBLING.

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:12.226
GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S BUDGET

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:13.661
PROPOSAL WHICH I THINK YOU GUYS

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:15.362
ARE GONNA TALK ABOUT LATER TODAY

01:37:15.429 --> 01:37:16.897
WE GIVE MODEST RELIEF BUT EVEN

01:37:16.964 --> 01:37:18.532
IF PASSED IT WILL NOT MEETING

01:37:18.599 --> 01:37:20.701
WITH THE AFFECT THE FINAL RATE.

01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:22.069
UNDER CURRENT LAW AND ASSUMING

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:23.871
ALL ACTUALLY ALSO ACTUARIAL

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:25.739
ASSUMPTIONS HOLD WHICH I THINK

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:27.208
IS OPTIMISTIC THE FINEST ORACLE

01:37:27.274 --> 01:37:28.442
EVIDENCING HOUSES AND OTHER

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:29.510
SIMILAR PLANS.

01:37:29.577 --> 01:37:30.511
THE HIGHER CONTRIBUTION RATES

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:32.880
WILL BE REQUIRED THROUGH.

01:37:32.947 --> 01:37:33.647
TWENTY FORTY SIX AT WHICH POINT

01:37:33.714 --> 01:37:35.382
THE FALL BY ABOUT HALF BECAUSE

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:37.551
THE DEBT WILL BE PAID DOWN.

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:38.586
IF THE ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS ARE

01:37:38.652 --> 01:37:39.753
TOO OPTIMISTIC THERE ONLY TWO

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.222
OPTIONS CONTRIBUTION RATES ARE

01:37:41.288 --> 01:37:42.556
GONNA HAVE TO GO HIGHER.

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:44.425
OR THE TWENTY FORTY SIX AND

01:37:44.491 --> 01:37:46.227
POINT IS GOING TO BE EXTENDED.

01:37:46.293 --> 01:37:47.161
WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON THE WORLD WE

01:37:47.228 --> 01:37:50.097
ADOPTED THE THE GET WELL PLAN.

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:51.999
THAT HAS A TWENTY FORTY SIX

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:52.833
DATED AS I RECALL THAT'S

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:54.602
CRACKERS AGO WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:56.403
THAT PLAN I MEAN I GUESS YOUR

01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:57.938
POINT IS THAT IF THE ACTUARIAL

01:37:58.005 --> 01:37:59.707
ASSUMPTIONS ARE CORRECT IT'S

01:37:59.773 --> 01:38:01.375
GOING TO BLOW UP AND IT ACTUAL

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:03.043
OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE CORRECT IN

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.311
THE CURRENT CONTRIBUTION RATES

01:38:04.378 --> 01:38:05.012
WHICH YOU.

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:05.946
KNOW IS A BIG REASON OR HOW

01:38:06.013 --> 01:38:06.780
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:09.450
PENSION PLANS RIGHT NOW -- ARE

01:38:09.516 --> 01:38:09.984
NATURALLY HIGHER.

01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:12.553
AND IF IF THE ACTUARIAL

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:14.054
ASSUMPTIONS TEND TO BE.

01:38:14.121 --> 01:38:16.390
IN LINE BY TWENTY FOUR FORTY SIX

01:38:16.457 --> 01:38:17.424
WE SHOULD HAVE THE PLAN THE

01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:19.593
UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.528
REDUCED OR ELIMINATED AT LEAST

01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:22.596
AS TO THOSE BENEFITS THAT

01:38:22.663 --> 01:38:25.799
ACCRUED UP TO TWENTY THIRTEEN OR

01:38:25.866 --> 01:38:27.134
FOURTEEN YES I IN PRINCIPLE IF

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:28.035
THEY IF ACTUALLY ASSUMPTIONS ARE

01:38:28.102 --> 01:38:29.837
CORRECT BY TWENTY FORTY SIX

01:38:29.903 --> 01:38:31.338
THINGS WILL BE WILL BE FINE.

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:32.640
THAT THE THE CONTRIBUTION RATE

01:38:32.706 --> 01:38:34.241
THE PLAN I'LL BE AROUND 20%

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:34.808
TOTAL WHICH I THINK IS QUITE

01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:37.378
MANAGEABLE.

01:38:37.444 --> 01:38:38.479
A DOMINGUEZ SHOVE TRUCKS ARE

01:38:38.545 --> 01:38:39.613
FACT THAT'S NOT THAT'S GOOD

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.281
CLARIFICATION.

01:38:40.347 --> 01:38:41.515
AND SO THAT'S MORE ABOUT LESS

01:38:41.582 --> 01:38:42.082
MORE LIKE WITH THE RATE WAS

01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:44.351
BEFORE THIS BIG COST INCREASES

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:45.719
IN.

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:46.720
TWENTY FOURTEEN OKAY SO ON IN

01:38:46.787 --> 01:38:47.288
THE LAST THING ON TALK ABOUT

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:47.921
BRIEFLY IS POSSIBILITY SHOULD

01:38:47.988 --> 01:38:49.390
CALIFORNIA WISH TO INITIATE THE

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:50.891
POLICY RESPONSE.

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:51.792
FIRST MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:53.694
CALIFORNIA'S NOT ALONEIN FACING

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:54.595
SUBSTANTIAL PENSION THAT THE

01:38:54.662 --> 01:38:55.729
TEACHERS PLAN.

01:38:55.796 --> 01:38:57.064
IN A RECENT ECONOMIC ARTICLE

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:58.165
MYSELF IN A TEAM A TEAM OF

01:38:58.232 --> 01:38:59.366
RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT ON

01:38:59.433 --> 01:39:01.068
AVERAGE ACROSS STATE PLANS IN

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:03.504
THE U. S. -- AS A TWENTY

01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:04.705
THIRTEEN ABOUT 10% OF TEACHER

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:05.939
SALARIES WERE BEING USED TO PAY

01:39:06.006 --> 01:39:07.941
DOWN PENSION THAT NUMBER IN

01:39:08.008 --> 01:39:09.376
CALIFORNIA COURT CALIFORNIA

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:10.644
RIGHT OUTSIDE 18%.

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:12.379
THIS IS THE ANNUAL DEBT

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:14.214
SERVICING COST.

01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:17.284
DIRECTLY.

01:39:17.351 --> 01:39:18.986
FOR THEY WOULD BE PAID 80% THAT

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:19.820
ARE MORE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:21.588
SAID THAT I THINK IS A BELIEVE

01:39:21.655 --> 01:39:22.256
THERE'S PROBABLY NOT ACCURATE IN

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:23.957
PRINCIPLE YOU COULD TRY TO DO

01:39:24.024 --> 01:39:24.792
THAT BUT IT'S AYE.

01:39:24.858 --> 01:39:25.793
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE PAST THERE

01:39:25.859 --> 01:39:28.429
WOULD BE SO EIGHT CURRENTLY

01:39:28.495 --> 01:39:30.230
THERE IS 80% YOU MEAN THAT

01:39:30.297 --> 01:39:31.298
THEY'RE TAKING THAT OUT OF THEIR

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:32.366
SALARIES THAT IT THAT THAT'S THE

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:34.401
PRICE OF THE DEBT THAT'S THE

01:39:34.468 --> 01:39:36.036
PRICE OF A DEAD AS A THAT THAT

01:39:36.103 --> 01:39:39.306
IS A PERCENT OF TEACHER SALARIES

01:39:39.373 --> 01:39:39.506
WHOSE.

01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:40.774
ACTUALLY PAYING.

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:41.909
IS NOT CLEAR SO YOU THINK THE

01:39:41.975 --> 01:39:42.676
THINK THE DISTRICTS MIGHT NOT BE

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:43.844
ABLE TO GET THE PAY RAISE THEY

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:44.445
WANT TO GET BECAUSE OF THIS.

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:45.079
BUT MAYBE THEY ARE GETTING ALL

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:45.679
THE PAY RAISES THEY CAN JUST

01:39:45.746 --> 01:39:46.413
PULL REVENUE THEY CAN COLLECT

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.281
MORE TAXES OR YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:39:47.348 --> 01:39:48.682
LOTS OF OUR WAY TO PAY FOR THIS

01:39:48.749 --> 01:39:49.917
BUT THE PRICE.

01:39:49.983 --> 01:39:50.551
OKAY AS A PERCENT OF TEACHERS

01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:52.486
SALARIES 18% JUST TO BE CLEAR

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:53.687
THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:56.623
OUR OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT.

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:58.692
PROJECTED CONTRIBUTION RATES --

01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:02.529
FOR CAL STIRS IN NINETEEN TWENTY

01:40:02.596 --> 01:40:03.997
FOUR EMPLOYEES PRE PREPARA. TEN

01:40:04.064 --> 01:40:05.966
POINT 3% OF THAT WITH YOU WERE

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:08.202
ASKING. ZERO YEAH I WAY WHEN HE

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:10.404
SAID THAT IT'S EIGHTEEN I WAS

01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:11.605
JUST TRYING TO GET A PERMIT FROM

01:40:11.672 --> 01:40:12.606
AN ECONOMIC PERSONALIZING THE

01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:13.474
DIRECT COST OF THE EMPLOYEES IS

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:15.809
10% FROM AN EONOMIC PERSPECTIVE.

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:16.877
OF THIS WHOLE THING IT'S UNCLEAR

01:40:16.944 --> 01:40:17.911
WHO PAYS WHEN THE DISTRICT HAS A

01:40:17.978 --> 01:40:19.947
HIGHER RATE THE MIGHT HEY IT BY

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:23.217
NOT GETTING TEACHERS RAISES HI

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:23.884
LYNN TEACHERS PAID BUT IT BUT IT

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:24.551
IT.

01:40:24.618 --> 01:40:26.019
THEY COULD SPEND ON ALL SORTS OF

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:27.821
THINGS YEP BUT EXPLAIN ALL HER

01:40:27.888 --> 01:40:28.455
THINGS OR THEY COULD JUST RAISE

01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:30.190
TAXES THE SYSTEM COULD GIVE IT

01:40:30.257 --> 01:40:31.258
ALL OF THE COUNTY OFFICES I MEAN

01:40:31.325 --> 01:40:33.026
YEAH I YEAH IT IS UNCLEAR ALL

01:40:33.093 --> 01:40:34.528
THE MONEY GOES RIGHT THAT'S THE

01:40:34.595 --> 01:40:35.696
PRICE I USUALLY POINT YEAH.

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:37.398
THANK YOU -- OKAY SO YOU'RE KEY

01:40:37.464 --> 01:40:38.232
POINT IS THAT WERE WE HAVE A

01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:39.666
MUCH HIGHER LIABILITY.

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:41.301
THAT'S TAKING UP MORE OF OUR

01:40:41.368 --> 01:40:42.870
EDUCATION FUNDING THAN IN THAT

01:40:42.936 --> 01:40:44.671
MOST STATES.

01:40:44.738 --> 01:40:45.672
YES BUT DIDN'T NEARLY TELL YOUR

01:40:45.739 --> 01:40:46.573
I. I DID JUMP TIME TOO SO IT'S

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:47.408
GETTING WORSE EVERYWHERE SO THE

01:40:47.474 --> 01:40:54.882
NOT THE 10% FIGURE I GAVE FOR

01:40:54.948 --> 01:40:56.116
THE NATION WAS AS A TWENTY

01:40:56.183 --> 01:40:56.717
THIRTEEN THE NUMBER I GAVE FOR

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:57.451
CALIFORNIA'S THE MOST RECENT

01:40:57.518 --> 01:40:59.186
OVER CALIFORNIA IS A HAS A

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:00.254
LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHER.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.389
COST THAT COST THEN THEN AVERAGE

01:41:02.456 --> 01:41:04.525
BUT NOT AS BIG AS THAT GAP IN

01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:05.325
PLACE IT IS A FOR THE SAME.

01:41:05.392 --> 01:41:07.428
GENERAL BENEFIT 2% PER YEAR OF

01:41:07.494 --> 01:41:11.098
SERVICES THAT THEY THAT WELL AS

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:12.399
YESTERDAY BENEFITS CAN BE TRICKY

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:13.367
TO PAY IT'S IT'S THE 22% IS ALSO

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:13.834
WHEN YOU CAN COLLECT.

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:14.401
AND AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF

01:41:14.468 --> 01:41:15.002
THINGS CALIFORNIA HAS A MORE

01:41:15.068 --> 01:41:16.403
GENEROUS THAN AVERAGE PENSION-PLAN.

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:19.206
BUT THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:20.407
TEACHERS ARE ON SOCIAL SECURITY.

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:21.341
CALIFORNIA'S PLAN IS QUITE

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:22.443
TYPICAL OF OF THE BENEFIT LEVEL

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:24.044
OF PLANS AND OTHER STATES WHERE

01:41:24.111 --> 01:41:24.778
TEACHERS ARE NOT AND SOCIAL

01:41:24.845 --> 01:41:27.915
SECURITY RIGHT -- OKAY SO A

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:28.849
NUMBER OF STATE TO PURSUE

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:30.250
STRUCTURAL FORMS TO THEIR FUTURE

01:41:30.317 --> 01:41:31.852
PENSION PLANS RESPONSE TO RISING

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.086
COSTS OF MY DAD.

01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:34.688
I REPORT GIVES MANY EXAMPLES OF

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:35.255
THESE I'M NOT GONNA WIN THE

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:36.957
DETAILS BUT THE COMMON THEME OF

01:41:37.024 --> 01:41:38.225
ALL SUCH REFORMS AS THAT THEY

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:40.260
HAVE DE EMPHASIZE THE DEFINED

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:42.329
BENEFIT PENSION STRUCTURE.

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:43.163
WHICH IS MOST COMMON STRUCTURE

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:44.131
PUBLIC CAN'T PLAY PENSION PLANS

01:41:44.198 --> 01:41:46.266
NATIONALLY IN THE STRUCTURE OF

01:41:46.333 --> 01:41:48.569
CASTERS.

01:41:48.635 --> 01:41:49.503
MOST A TO REFORM THEIR PLANS BY

01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:50.170
BLENDING DEFINED BENEFIT AND

01:41:50.237 --> 01:41:52.639
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS. FOR

01:41:52.706 --> 01:41:53.874
EXAMPLE SOME STATES NOW OFFER

01:41:53.941 --> 01:41:55.642
HYBRID PLANS TO COMBINE BOTH

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:57.211
TYPES.

01:41:57.277 --> 01:41:58.178
AND OTHERS GIVE TEACHERS A

01:41:58.245 --> 01:41:59.613
CHOICE BETWEEN PLANS DUE TO TIME

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:00.781
CONSTRAINTS ON I CAN EXPLAIN HOW

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:02.349
THIS TYPE OF PLAN WORKS.

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:03.550
BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE IMPETUS

01:42:03.617 --> 01:42:04.151
FOR THE SHIP TO THAT THE

01:42:04.218 --> 01:42:05.185
STRUCTURE OF DEFINED

01:42:05.252 --> 01:42:07.554
CONTRIBUTION PLANS IS THAT THEY

01:42:07.621 --> 01:42:09.289
PREVENT DATA COOL.

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:10.090
AS I'VE ALREADY EXPLAINED THAT

01:42:10.157 --> 01:42:11.358
ACROSS TYPICAL DEFINED BENEFIT

01:42:11.425 --> 01:42:12.960
PLANS AS THEY'VE BEEN

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:14.628
IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE.

01:42:14.695 --> 01:42:15.662
AND THEN FINALLY RESURGENT

01:42:15.729 --> 01:42:17.197
STATES HAVE ADOPTED HYBRID

01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:18.432
CHOICE PLANS FIND THAT THERE IS

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:19.867
STRONG DEMAND AMONG TEACHERS FOR

01:42:19.933 --> 01:42:20.968
BOTH TYPES OF RETIREMENT

01:42:21.034 --> 01:42:22.536
BENEFITS STRUCTURES.

01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:24.071
SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED

01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:28.075
REMARKS THINK FICTIONAL.

01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:30.310
SO I'M PAUL WARNER I'M NEXT ARM

01:42:30.377 --> 01:42:31.144
THEM WITH PUBLIC POLICY

01:42:31.211 --> 01:42:33.146
INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA I'M GONNA

01:42:33.213 --> 01:42:35.048
TALK ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:35.349
[inaudible]

01:42:35.415 --> 01:42:37.284
N..

01:42:37.351 --> 01:42:38.252
YES THE FOR SOME HELP TO

01:42:38.318 --> 01:42:39.887
UNDERSTAND WHY SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:42:39.953 --> 01:42:41.288
COSTS HAVE INCREASED -- SO

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:42.589
QUICKLY.

01:42:42.656 --> 01:42:45.859
SO FIRST SOME BACKGROUND -- THE

01:42:45.926 --> 01:42:48.095
AB SIX OH TWO FORMULAS WHAT

01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:50.531
GUIDES -- STATE FUNDING FOR

01:42:50.597 --> 01:42:52.599
SPECIAL ED TO DISTRICTS.

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:54.268
ARE ON AVERAGE.

01:42:54.334 --> 01:42:55.302
SB SIX OR TO PROVIDE ABOUT

01:42:55.369 --> 01:42:57.571
BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX HUNDRED

01:42:57.638 --> 01:42:58.972
DOLLARS A STUDENT TO DISTRICTS.

01:42:59.039 --> 01:43:00.407
WHEN I SAY A STUDENT THAT'S

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:02.976
BASED ON?

01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:04.311
THE ENTIRE DISTRICT EDA.

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:06.346
SO IF JUST VERY ROUGHLY OF 10%

01:43:06.413 --> 01:43:08.415
OF STUDENTS ARE SPECIAL THEN.

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:09.983
THEN FOR EACH SPECIAL ED STUDENT

01:43:10.050 --> 01:43:13.253
DISTRICTS GET ROUGHLY FIVE TO

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.022
SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS -- IN STATE

01:43:15.088 --> 01:43:19.359
FUNDING EVERY YEAR -- SO.

01:43:19.426 --> 01:43:21.562
AND THEN EVERY YEAR THE STATE

01:43:21.628 --> 01:43:25.032
BUDGET UPDATES THOSE FIGURES FOR

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:25.732
OF YOUR COST OF LIVING

01:43:25.799 --> 01:43:26.900
ADJUSTMENT.

01:43:26.967 --> 01:43:28.969
AND FOR GOOD AND THE CHANGE IN A

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:30.404
DA.

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.771
I SHOULD NOTE.

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:32.105
THIS FORMULA'S BEEN AROUND FOR

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:33.440
ABOUT TWENTY YEARS.

01:43:33.507 --> 01:43:35.842
AND WHAT DOESN'T CHANGE IN THE

01:43:35.909 --> 01:43:38.679
FORMULA IS CHANGES IN DISTRICT

01:43:38.745 --> 01:43:39.980
COST STRUCTURES FOR SPECIAL

01:43:40.047 --> 01:43:40.914
EDUCATION.

01:43:40.981 --> 01:43:43.183
AND THAT'S REALLY A LOT OF

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:44.351
WHAT'S GOING ON IN.

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:45.953
DISTRICTS NOW THAT'S CAUSING

01:43:46.019 --> 01:43:48.388
FINANCIAL STRESS IN THAT PROGRAM

01:43:48.455 --> 01:43:50.223
M. WE'VE IDENTIFIED THREE REAL

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:51.558
SPECIFIC FACTORS.

01:43:51.625 --> 01:43:53.360
FIRST HAVE BEEN CHANGES IN THE

01:43:53.427 --> 01:43:55.996
RATE OF STUDENTS IDENTIFIED WITH

01:43:56.063 --> 01:43:56.997
DISABILITIES.

01:43:57.064 --> 01:44:00.033
AND AND THE TYPE OF DISABILITIES --

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:01.835
IN OUR RODENT TWO THOUSAND

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:03.303
SIXTEEN REPORT.

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:05.505
ON SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE WE

01:44:05.572 --> 01:44:07.274
ESTIMATED THAT OVER TEN YEAR

01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:09.309
PERIOD ENDING IN.

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:11.144
I THINK WAS FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:12.112
SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS WENT UP

01:44:12.179 --> 01:44:15.682
ON THE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:17.584
LITTLE MORE -- JUST BECAUSE OF

01:44:17.651 --> 01:44:21.054
pEDUCATION STUDENTS AND MORE

01:44:21.121 --> 01:44:22.122
IMPORTANTLY THE TYPE OF SPECIAL

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:23.991
EDUCATION STUDENTS THAT WERE

01:44:24.057 --> 01:44:25.726
BEING SERVED.

01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:26.693
AUTISM HAS.

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.929
REALLY INCREASED A LOT IN OUR

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:30.530
STATE AND AND THEIR THAT

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:32.366
DISABILITIES EXPENSIVE ON

01:44:32.432 --> 01:44:36.536
AVERAGE -- TO TO ADDRESS AND SO

01:44:36.603 --> 01:44:37.838
THOSE TWO FACTORS.

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:39.373
IS ONE BIG REASON WHY SPECIAL

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:40.440
EDUCATION IS MORE EXPENSIVE

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:42.275
TODAY.

01:44:42.342 --> 01:44:43.844
AGAIN THE FORMULA DIDN'T ADJUST

01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:45.746
TO THE CHANGES IN THE TYPE OF

01:44:45.812 --> 01:44:48.548
KIDS -- OR IN THE NUMBER OF OF

01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:49.616
SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS.

01:44:49.683 --> 01:44:52.486
ALSO THE GROWTH IN THE PRESCHOOL

01:44:52.552 --> 01:44:53.520
SPECIAL EDUCATION POPULATION

01:44:53.587 --> 01:44:55.288
PRESCHOOLS IS REQUIRED UNDER

01:44:55.355 --> 01:44:57.057
FEDERAL LAW.

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:59.960
AND THE THE NUMBER OF SPECIAL

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:01.228
EDUCATION STUDENTS.

01:45:01.294 --> 01:45:04.264
UNDER AGE FIVE INCREASED --

01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:07.067
ABOUT 10% DURING THAT PERIOD.

01:45:07.134 --> 01:45:09.236
WELL -- SINCE SINCE PRESCHOOL

01:45:09.302 --> 01:45:12.172
STUDENTS DON'T COUNT AS A AS A

01:45:12.239 --> 01:45:13.807
K. TWELVE STUDENT.

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:16.476
OF THE FORMULA DID NOT ADJUST

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:17.711
FOR THAT INCREASE SO THAT'S

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:19.880
ANOTHER FACTOR.

01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:22.149
THE THIRD FACTOR IS IS -- TO

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:23.617
COMES OUT OF THE FACT THIS

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:24.951
SPECIAL EDUCATION ELSE IF OF

01:45:25.018 --> 01:45:26.019
HAVE BEEN TREATED QUITE

01:45:26.086 --> 01:45:28.522
DIFFERENTLY SINCE THE CREATION

01:45:28.588 --> 01:45:29.756
OF BILLS HERE FOR A LOT OF NEW

01:45:29.823 --> 01:45:32.726
MONEY OR OR RESTORATION OF MONEY

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:35.495
WAS PUT INTO ELSE IF OF OVERTIME.

01:45:35.562 --> 01:45:36.897
TO TO FULLY FUND THAT FORMULA

01:45:36.963 --> 01:45:38.632
AND SPECIAL EDUCATION DIDN'T GET

01:45:38.699 --> 01:45:40.367
COMMENSURATE INCREASES SO --

01:45:40.434 --> 01:45:43.537
SERVER WAS DRIVING THE SALARY

01:45:43.603 --> 01:45:46.139
DISCUSSION IN MOST DISTRICTS --

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:46.973
AND SO.

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.175
YOU KNOW -- TEACHERS AND OTHER

01:45:48.241 --> 01:45:49.776
EMPLOYEES GOT THE THE THE

01:45:49.843 --> 01:45:50.811
INCREASES THAT THEY BARGAINED.

01:45:50.877 --> 01:45:54.247
FOR AND AND SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:45:54.314 --> 01:45:55.782
WAS OF COURSE INCLUDED IN THAT

01:45:55.849 --> 01:45:57.984
RIGHT BUT BY SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:45:58.051 --> 01:45:59.586
BUDGETS NO THE STATE FUNDING

01:45:59.653 --> 01:46:00.687
DIDN'T GO UP.

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:02.789
COMMENSURATELY WITH WHAT WAS

01:46:02.856 --> 01:46:03.690
HAPPENING YOU KNOW CFS SO

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:05.192
DISTRICTS WERE FORCED TO SPEND

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:06.460
MORE OF THEIR GENERAL PURPOSE

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:08.829
MONEY RIGHT ON SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:46:08.895 --> 01:46:09.596
AND TO PAY FOR THAT.

01:46:09.663 --> 01:46:11.598
SO THOSE ARE THREE OF THE MAIN

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:14.968
FACTORS THAT WE SEE OUT THERE --

01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:17.337
YOU KNOW PUSHING A SPECIAL

01:46:17.404 --> 01:46:18.004
EDUCATION COSTS HIGHER

01:46:18.071 --> 01:46:18.305
[inaudible]

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:19.573
SO.

01:46:19.639 --> 01:46:22.142
WE PUT OUT A SECOND REPORT IN

01:46:22.209 --> 01:46:22.776
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS PART OF

01:46:22.843 --> 01:46:24.010
GETTING DONE FAX.

01:46:24.077 --> 01:46:26.079
THAT RE EXAMINE SOME OF THESE

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:28.782
COULD ISSUES AND WE CAME UP WITH

01:46:28.849 --> 01:46:30.383
A COUPLE OF OPTIONS THAT.

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:31.818
FOR LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION

01:46:31.885 --> 01:46:33.820
IN HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH

01:46:33.887 --> 01:46:35.288
SPECIAL YOU KNOW WITH MAKING

01:46:35.355 --> 01:46:36.923
SPECIAL EDUCATION MORE

01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.791
RESPONSIVE OVER TIME

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:38.091
[inaudible]

01:46:38.158 --> 01:46:43.797
AND WE THINK YOU COULD EITHER --

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:45.398
ONE INCREASED FUNDING FOR FOR

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:47.534
SPECIAL EDUCATION AT THE SAME

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:48.769
RATE AS YOU DO FOR US IF I HAVE

01:46:48.835 --> 01:46:50.771
SO THAT THERE ISN'T THIS FUNNY

01:46:50.837 --> 01:46:53.006
DISEQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE TWO

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:53.907
PROGRAMS.

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:55.208
THAT CAUSES DISTRICT STAFF TO

01:46:55.275 --> 01:46:56.743
SPEND MORE OUT OF THEIR OF

01:46:56.810 --> 01:46:58.478
SPECIAL I I'D OF THE GENERAL

01:46:58.545 --> 01:46:59.713
PURPOSE FUNDS.

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.047
OR YOU COULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW

01:47:01.114 --> 01:47:02.883
WHAT WHAT WE WANNA DO IS HAVE

01:47:02.949 --> 01:47:04.451
THE STATE SHARE OF SPECIAL

01:47:04.518 --> 01:47:05.685
EDUCATION COSTS BECAUSE TEN OVER

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:06.653
TIME.

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.321
AND YOU COULD DO THAT BY SAYING

01:47:08.388 --> 01:47:10.157
WELL WE'LL GO BACK TO THE MOST

01:47:10.223 --> 01:47:12.225
RECENT YEAR WE HAVE ACCOUNTING

01:47:12.292 --> 01:47:13.627
DATA ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT.

01:47:13.693 --> 01:47:15.996
WAS PENT ON SPECIAL LED BY

01:47:16.062 --> 01:47:17.998
DISTRICTS AN INCREASE THE

01:47:18.064 --> 01:47:21.101
STATE'S SHARE OF ACCORDINGLY AT

01:47:21.168 --> 01:47:22.402
AS IN FUTURE BUDGETS

01:47:22.469 --> 01:47:22.702
[inaudible]

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:24.004
SO.

01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:26.439
WE RECOMMEND CAUTION ABOUT GOING

01:47:26.506 --> 01:47:28.408
OF BASING FUNDING ON THE COUNT

01:47:28.475 --> 01:47:29.876
OF SPECIAL ED STUDENTS.

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:31.945
WE LOOKED AT THE INCIDENCE OF

01:47:32.012 --> 01:47:33.480
SPECIALIZED IN DIFFERENT PARTS

01:47:33.547 --> 01:47:34.848
OF THE CUT OF THE STATE AND

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:36.783
THEIR SURPRISING VARIATION IN

01:47:36.850 --> 01:47:38.218
THE PERCENT OF KIDS WHO ARE IN

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:39.252
SPECIAL ED.

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:41.454
WEFOUND ONE COUNTY THAT ISSUE

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:43.990
IS JUST ABOUT A 9% OF KIDS IN

01:47:44.057 --> 01:47:45.125
SPECIAL ED.

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:47.060
AND ANOTHER COUNTY THE HEAD OVER

01:47:47.127 --> 01:47:48.829
17% OF STUDENTS IN SPECIAL

01:47:48.895 --> 01:47:50.564
EDUCATION IS THAT THE ISSUE OF

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:53.200
EQUALIZATION OF FUNDING THAT WE

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:54.267
HEAR ABOUT HERE NO.

01:47:54.334 --> 01:47:56.336
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT

01:47:56.403 --> 01:47:57.704
MAYBE TOUCH OR ARE YOU ABLE TO

01:47:57.771 --> 01:47:59.139
TOUCH ON THAT AT SOME POINT SURE

01:47:59.206 --> 01:48:00.440
THAT WAS IN.

01:48:00.507 --> 01:48:06.313
A REPORT -- THERE'S A A LARGE --

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:07.214
THIS IS JUST A HISTORICAL KIND

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.648
OF FACTOR THAT IS TYPICAL IN

01:48:08.715 --> 01:48:09.316
STATE.

01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:11.551
YOU KNOW FINDING PROGRAMS WHERE --

01:48:11.618 --> 01:48:13.587
SOME CHANGES WERE MADE AND IT

01:48:13.653 --> 01:48:16.656
THIS EQUALIZED -- THE WHAT

01:48:16.723 --> 01:48:18.325
DISTRICTS GET IN IN TERMS OF

01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:20.594
STATE FUNDING WE DID SPEND.

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:22.262
QUITE A BIT OF MONEY IN THE

01:48:22.329 --> 01:48:23.930
EARLY TWO THOUSANDS TRYING.

01:48:23.997 --> 01:48:25.465
TO DO SOME OF THAT EQUALIZATION

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:29.402
pHIT -- THOSE KIND EFFORTS HAD TO

01:48:29.469 --> 01:48:30.270
STOP.

01:48:30.337 --> 01:48:31.705
IN THERE ARE PRETTY BIG

01:48:31.771 --> 01:48:33.707
DIFFERENCES IN IN DISTRICT

01:48:33.773 --> 01:48:36.710
FUNDING -- WE HAD RECOMMENDED --

01:48:36.776 --> 01:48:39.946
IN ONE OF OUR REPORTS THAT.

01:48:40.013 --> 01:48:42.449
YOU COULD EQUALIZE UP TO I THINK

01:48:42.515 --> 01:48:45.652
IS THE 95% -- YOU KNOW YOU CAN

01:48:45.719 --> 01:48:46.152
YOU CAN MAKE ALMOST ALL

01:48:46.219 --> 01:48:47.387
DISTRICTS.

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:49.789
BE FUNDED AT THE SAME LEVEL --

01:48:49.856 --> 01:48:53.360
BUT IT TAKES -- IT TAKES SOME

01:48:53.426 --> 01:48:55.729
REAL MONIES -- ONE STATES IN THE

01:48:55.795 --> 01:48:56.429
SEVERAL HUNDRED MLLION DOLLAR

01:48:56.496 --> 01:48:58.164
RANGE AND I WAS TRYING TO

01:48:58.231 --> 01:48:59.699
UNDERSTAND THE TO THE THE CAUSE

01:48:59.766 --> 01:49:02.903
OF THE EQUALIZATION ISSUE IS AT

01:49:02.969 --> 01:49:04.104
THE POPULATION SHIFT STUDENT

01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:06.373
POPULATION SHIFT INCREASES IN

01:49:06.439 --> 01:49:08.541
SCHOOL POPULATION -- ITS IT'S

01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:11.578
IT'S MORE -- WHO IS IN CONTROL

01:49:11.645 --> 01:49:12.178
AT THE TIME?

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:13.313
WELL SO.

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:15.348
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS IN THE TWO

01:49:15.415 --> 01:49:18.351
THOUSANDS THE -- THE FEDERAL

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:19.986
GOVERNMENT WAS PUTTING MORE

01:49:20.053 --> 01:49:21.621
MONEY INTO SPECIAL EDUCATION TO

01:49:21.688 --> 01:49:25.625
TRY TO LIVE UP CERTAIN PERCENT

01:49:25.692 --> 01:49:28.328
OF COSTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:29.863
OUR MODEL BACK THEN WAS A

01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:32.132
BLENDED MODEL OF BOTH FEDERAL

01:49:32.198 --> 01:49:34.034
AND STATE SPENDING AND WE

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:35.969
PROVIDED WE GUARANTEED A CERTAIN

01:49:36.036 --> 01:49:37.270
AMOUNT FOR DISTRICTS.

01:49:37.337 --> 01:49:38.872
SO THAT MEANT THAT WHAT WE'RE

01:49:38.939 --> 01:49:40.707
ACTUALLY DOING IS TAKING SOME OF

01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:42.175
THE FEDERAL FUNDS.

01:49:42.242 --> 01:49:43.543
IT WAS THAT WAS GOING UP FAST

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:46.079
AND WE'RE BACKING OUT STAE FUND.

01:49:46.146 --> 01:49:47.580
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY

01:49:47.647 --> 01:49:48.848
BE UNDERSTANDABLY WASN'T VERY

01:49:48.915 --> 01:49:50.583
HAPPY AT THAT AND SO THEY PASSED

01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:51.418
A LAW SAYING YOU COULDN'T DO

01:49:51.484 --> 01:49:52.953
THAT.

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:54.454
SO WE HAD TO REALLY.

01:49:54.521 --> 01:49:56.122
SEPARATE THE TWO SYSTEMS AND

01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:57.657
WHEN WE DID THAT THEN YOU KNOW

01:49:57.724 --> 01:49:59.459
THE STATE FUNDING WHICH HAD BEEN

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:02.495
JUST REALLY -- YOU KNOW BASED IN

01:50:02.562 --> 01:50:04.764
PART ON THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT

01:50:04.831 --> 01:50:06.733
THERE'S JUST ALL NO LOGIC TO THE

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:09.369
STATE LEVELS ANYMORE RIGHT.

01:50:09.436 --> 01:50:11.438
BECAUSE WE THE THE TWO PIECES

01:50:11.504 --> 01:50:13.573
WERE WERE VERY CONSISTENT WENT

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.475
YOU ADDED THEM TOGETHER BUT THE

01:50:15.542 --> 01:50:17.210
FEDERAL MOUNTS WITH COULD BE

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:18.778
QUITE DIFFERENT IS BASED ON A

01:50:18.845 --> 01:50:20.080
DIFFERENT FORMULA AND THEN STATE

01:50:20.146 --> 01:50:20.647
FORMULA.

01:50:20.714 --> 01:50:23.283
SO IT'S JUST AN ARTIFACT OF THIS

01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:26.686
FUNNY TENSION BETWEEN THE STATE

01:50:26.753 --> 01:50:27.220
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:27.520
[inaudible]

01:50:27.587 --> 01:50:30.223
AND SO THERE WAS SOME SCHOOLS

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:31.825
FOR I GUESS THAT WOULD GET.

01:50:31.891 --> 01:50:32.959
THE FULL STATE MONEY AND THEN

01:50:33.026 --> 01:50:34.661
THE FEDERAL MONEY ON TOP BECAUSE

01:50:34.728 --> 01:50:36.296
THERE WAS NO OFFSET [inaudible]

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:38.398
AND HENCE.

01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:40.100
UNEQUAL FUNDING AROUND THE STATE

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:42.469
THAT'S RIGHT YES.

01:50:42.535 --> 01:50:43.937
THE BALANCING WENT AWAY YES YES

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:45.905
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:50:45.972 --> 01:50:48.541
MY SIMPLISTIC WAY OF THANK YOU

01:50:48.608 --> 01:50:50.744
FOR TOUCHING ON THE SHIP.

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:53.246
SO THAT'S REALLY -- YOU KNOW

01:50:53.313 --> 01:50:55.148
WHAT I CAME SAID TODAY HAPPY TO

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:57.450
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS PERFECT --

01:50:57.517 --> 01:51:00.920
ONLY QUESTIONS OR WAY OUR SURE.

CALIFORNIA I WAS ASKED TO COME

01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:05.825
HERE TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:51:05.892 --> 01:51:07.260
ABOUT HEALTH AND WELFARE

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:07.694
BENEFITS.

01:51:07.761 --> 01:51:09.529
IN DISTRICTS -- ALSO REPORT AS

01:51:09.596 --> 01:51:10.797
PART OF THE GETTING DOWN TO FAX

01:51:10.864 --> 01:51:12.265
PROJECT I'VE TRIED UPDATE THAT A

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:12.932
LITTLE BIT WITH SOME OF THE MORE

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:14.901
RECENT DATA FROM TWENTY

01:51:14.968 --> 01:51:15.602
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SCHOOL YEAR --

01:51:15.668 --> 01:51:16.836
AS HAS BEEN TOUCHED ON A LITTLE

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:18.705
ALREADY TODAY MOST DISTRICTS IN

01:51:18.772 --> 01:51:19.806
CALIFORNIA OFFER REALLY TWO

01:51:19.873 --> 01:51:20.740
TYPES OF HEALTH AND WELFARE

01:51:20.807 --> 01:51:22.042
BENEFITS THERE'S THOSE BENEFITS

01:51:22.108 --> 01:51:23.410
FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES MEDICAL AND

DENTAL AND THEN THERE'S THE

01:51:24.944 --> 01:51:26.079
CONTINUING BENEFITS.

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:27.247
VOTERS ENTITLED -- PADS FOR THE

01:51:27.313 --> 01:51:28.882
RETIRED EMPLOYEES WHO CONTINUE

01:51:28.948 --> 01:51:30.283
TO RECEIVE THESE BENEFITS AND

01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:31.418
THE CONCERN FOR A LOT OF

01:51:31.484 --> 01:51:33.053
DISTRICTS IS THAT.

01:51:33.119 --> 01:51:34.354
THE COST OF THESE BENEFITS OF

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:35.855
INCREASED AT A MUCH FASTER RATE

01:51:35.922 --> 01:51:37.490
THAN THEIR REVENUES EXPENDITURES

01:51:37.557 --> 01:51:40.026
AS A WHOLE SO FROM SINCE TWO

01:51:40.093 --> 01:51:40.660
THOUSAND FOUR FOR EXAMPLE JUST

01:51:40.727 --> 01:51:41.227
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF LIKE

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:42.829
TOTAL PER PUPIL SPENDING IN THE

01:51:42.896 --> 01:51:45.298
STATE IS UP BY ABOUT 18%.

01:51:45.365 --> 01:51:46.199
AFTER ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION

01:51:46.266 --> 01:51:48.535
BUT IT'S UP ABOUT 39% ON HEALTH

01:51:48.601 --> 01:51:49.836
AND WELFARE BENEFITS FOR ACTIVE

01:51:49.903 --> 01:51:53.106
EMPLOYEES ABOUT 85% FOR THESE --

01:51:53.173 --> 01:51:54.441
PERHAPS ON A PER PUPIL BASIS SO

01:51:54.507 --> 01:51:56.376
INCREASING TWO TO FOUR TIMES

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:57.710
FASTER THAN SPENDING AS A WHOLE

01:51:57.777 --> 01:52:00.113
IS UP BY 85% YES RIGHT NOW OPENS

01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:01.714
AS OUR SMALL PART OF DISTRICT

01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:02.849
BUDGETS BUT THEY'RE INCREASING

01:52:02.916 --> 01:52:05.518
AT A MUCH FASTER RATE -- THAN --

01:52:05.585 --> 01:52:07.020
THAN A TEN SPENDING AS A WHOLE

01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:08.388
AND SUPPORT WHAT THAT MEANS IS

01:52:08.455 --> 01:52:09.189
THAT THESE SPENDING ON THESE

01:52:09.255 --> 01:52:10.457
BENEFITS INCLUDE IT IS A LARGER

01:52:10.523 --> 01:52:12.225
PART OF DISTRICT BUDGETS NOW

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:12.892
THAN IT USED TO BE SO NOW

01:52:12.959 --> 01:52:14.561
DISTRICTS OF ALL OF ALL SPENDING

01:52:14.627 --> 01:52:15.762
ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT

01:52:15.829 --> 01:52:16.429
IS ON THE HEALTH.

01:52:16.496 --> 01:52:18.064
AND WELFARE BENEFITS FOR ACTIVE

01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:19.566
EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES THAT'S UP

01:52:19.632 --> 01:52:26.339
FROM ABOUT 7% FIFTEEN YEARS AGO.

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:27.440
AND THIS IS REALLY FOR TWO MAIN

01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:28.208
REASONS ONE IS THAT DISTRICTS IN

01:52:28.274 --> 01:52:29.242
PLACE SLIGHTLY MORE STAFF PER

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:30.276
STUDENT THAN THEY USED TO SO

01:52:30.343 --> 01:52:31.244
THAT INCREASES BENEFIT COST TO

01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:31.811
SOME EXTENT.

01:52:31.878 --> 01:52:33.580
A SOMEWHAT LARGER ISSUE IS THAT

01:52:33.646 --> 01:52:35.582
THE PER STAFF COST OF THESE

01:52:35.648 --> 01:52:36.883
BENEFITS AS INCREASED.

01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:39.152
MORE RAPIDLY AS IT HAS FOR MANY

01:52:39.219 --> 01:52:40.120
TYPES OF AMERICAN WORKERS OF

01:52:40.186 --> 01:52:41.421
JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE

01:52:41.488 --> 01:52:42.722
AVERAGE COST OF HEALTH BENEFITS

01:52:42.789 --> 01:52:45.525
PER TEACHER IS ABOUT 34% HIGHER

01:52:45.592 --> 01:52:47.627
NOW THAN IT WAS AND IN.

01:52:47.694 --> 01:52:48.194
TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND IT'S

01:52:48.261 --> 01:52:49.295
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR

01:52:49.362 --> 01:52:50.163
SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:52.599
OFTEN PAYING A LARGER SHARE.

01:52:52.665 --> 01:52:55.235
OF THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COST

01:52:55.301 --> 01:52:56.669
THEY OFTEN PLANT PAY ALMOST ALL

01:52:56.736 --> 01:52:57.770
OF THE BENEFIT COST FOR THE

01:52:57.837 --> 01:52:58.872
EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES ARE MAKING A

01:52:58.938 --> 01:53:00.406
CONTRIBUTION -- WHICH MEANS THAT

01:53:00.473 --> 01:53:01.341
THE DISTRICT IS OFTEN

01:53:01.407 --> 01:53:02.809
SHOULDERING THE FULL COST OF

01:53:02.876 --> 01:53:05.345
THIS THIS THIS AND THIS COST

01:53:05.411 --> 01:53:06.980
GROWTH -- THAT'S CONFERS

01:53:07.046 --> 01:53:07.914
CONCERNING FOR SOME OF THE

01:53:07.981 --> 01:53:09.149
OBVIOUS REASONS FOR DISTRICTS IT

01:53:09.215 --> 01:53:10.316
PREVENTS THEM FROM INVESTING IN

01:53:10.383 --> 01:53:11.851
SOME OTHER OTHER PRIORITIES LIKE

01:53:11.918 --> 01:53:13.086
SERVICES FRIEND DUPLICATED

01:53:13.153 --> 01:53:14.254
PEOPLE'S UNDER LC FF FOR

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.522
NAVIGATING THESE THESE PENSION

01:53:15.588 --> 01:53:16.890
CONTRIBUTIONS OF TEACHER SALARY

01:53:16.956 --> 01:53:19.225
INCREASES AND ADDITIONAL CONCERN

01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:20.627
IS THAT THESE KINDS OF COSTS FOR

01:53:20.693 --> 01:53:21.628
HEALTH AND WELFARE.

01:53:21.694 --> 01:53:23.129
BENEFITS WILL TEND TO INCREASE --

01:53:23.196 --> 01:53:25.732
EVEN IF DISTRICT REVENUES DON'T

01:53:25.798 --> 01:53:26.900
SO WE'VE ANNA SO I THINK IN

01:53:26.966 --> 01:53:27.834
RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN A

01:53:27.901 --> 01:53:29.402
GROWTH AND REVENUE AND DISTRICTS

01:53:29.469 --> 01:53:30.637
THIS IS MAYBE STEPS GEARED

01:53:30.703 --> 01:53:31.738
SOMEWHAT SOME OF THIS COST

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:32.472
GROWTH IN HEALTH AND WELFARE

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:33.673
BENEFITS BUT THERE'S NO

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:34.874
GUARANTEE THAT DISTRICT REVENUES

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:36.009
WILL CONTINUE GROWING IN THE

01:53:36.075 --> 01:53:36.242
FUTURE.

01:53:36.309 --> 01:53:37.243
PARTICULARLY IF THE STATE

01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:38.912
ECONOMY DETERIORATES TO SOME

01:53:38.978 --> 01:53:40.580
EXTENT THESE THESE KINDS OF

01:53:40.647 --> 01:53:42.215
COSTS WILL TEND TO GROW ANYWAY.

01:53:42.282 --> 01:53:43.283
AND THEN AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED A

01:53:43.349 --> 01:53:44.517
LITTLE BIT EARLIER THERE THESE

01:53:44.584 --> 01:53:46.219
RETIREE BENEFITS THESE -- PADS

01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:46.819
THEY REPRESENT SORT OF A

01:53:46.886 --> 01:53:49.255
SEPARATE CHALLENGE FOR DISTRICTS --

01:53:49.322 --> 01:53:50.523
AS I THINK WAS MENTIONED I THINK

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:52.058
THE STATEWIDE UNFUNDED

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:53.793
LIABILITIES FOR THESE BENEFITS

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:54.594
HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS THAT

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:56.229
HAVE BEEN PROMISED TO RETIREES

01:53:56.296 --> 01:53:57.664
IS IN THE TWENTY FIVE BILLION

01:53:57.730 --> 01:53:58.698
DOLLAR RANGE.

01:53:58.765 --> 01:54:00.200
THAT'S PARTICULARLY AN ISSUE FOR

01:54:00.266 --> 01:54:01.334
A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:02.702
DISTRICTS MAYBE TEN TO FIFTEEN

01:54:02.769 --> 01:54:03.303
DISTRICTS.

01:54:03.369 --> 01:54:05.038
THAT HAVE VERY LARGE UNFUNDED

01:54:05.104 --> 01:54:09.776
LIABILITIES AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL

01:54:09.842 --> 01:54:11.945
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PEOPLE.

01:54:12.011 --> 01:54:14.547
AND THOUGH THIS DOES DISTRICTS

01:54:14.614 --> 01:54:15.682
THAT TEND THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:17.650
EARLIER THAT TEND TO HAVE.

01:54:17.717 --> 01:54:19.552
MUCH MORE GENEROUS SO BAD.

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:20.920
I YES THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND

01:54:20.987 --> 01:54:24.924
AND TO HAVE NOT -- PRE FUNDED

01:54:24.991 --> 01:54:25.558
THEM SAYS ME AS AND TALK ABOUT A

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:27.694
LITTLE BIT.

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:28.795
OKAY SO S. AS IN THE MIX IS A

01:54:28.861 --> 01:54:29.429
LITTLE COMPLICATED IS THAT A BY

01:54:29.495 --> 01:54:30.430
LAW DISTRICTS ARE NEGOTIATING

01:54:30.496 --> 01:54:31.431
THESE BENEFITS PACKAGES WITH

01:54:31.497 --> 01:54:32.599
THEIR EMPLOYEES BOTH ACTIVE

01:54:32.665 --> 01:54:33.566
EMPLOYEES AND FOR THEIR RETIREES

01:54:33.633 --> 01:54:34.234
SO THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION SO

01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:35.001
IT'S HARD TO TALK IN VERY

01:54:35.068 --> 01:54:36.402
GENERAL TERMS ABOUT SORT OF WHAT.

01:54:36.469 --> 01:54:37.370
THE CHALLENGES FOR DISTRICTS ARE

01:54:37.437 --> 01:54:40.406
WHAT THE PATH FORWARD MIGHT BE

01:54:40.473 --> 01:54:41.040
BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU

01:54:41.107 --> 01:54:42.709
SEE IS THAT -- DISTRICTS ONE OF

01:54:42.775 --> 01:54:43.309
THE WAYS FOR EXAMPLE DISTRICTS

01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:44.844
CAN SAVE ON THEIR BENEFIT COSTS

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:47.780
FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES IS BY --

01:54:47.847 --> 01:54:48.514
FOUR ONE REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO

01:54:48.581 --> 01:54:49.682
PLAY LOWER PAY A LARGER SHARE OF

01:54:49.749 --> 01:54:52.051
AND THESE BENEFIT PLANS WHILE

01:54:52.118 --> 01:54:52.852
THEY'RE WORKING SO ONE OF THE

01:54:52.919 --> 01:54:54.320
THINGS YOU SEE THERE'S SOME

01:54:54.387 --> 01:54:54.954
EVIDENCE FROM OTHER STATES FOR

01:54:55.021 --> 01:54:55.722
EXAMPLE THAT.

01:54:55.788 --> 01:54:56.623
WHEN TEACHERS ARE PAYING A

01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:58.024
LARGER SHARE OF THEIR BENEFIT

01:54:58.091 --> 01:54:59.192
COSTS?

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:00.326
THE DISTRICTS SAVE MONEY NOT

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:01.794
JUST BECAUSE THE THE TEACHERS

01:55:01.861 --> 01:55:02.595
ARE PAYING SOME OF THOSE COSTS

01:55:02.662 --> 01:55:04.097
DIRECTLY BUT BECAUSE THE

01:55:04.163 --> 01:55:05.598
TEACHERS ARE OPTING TO BUY SO

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:07.333
MUCH CHEAPER PLANS -- FOR

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:08.134
EXAMPLE WHICH MEANS THE MIGHT BE

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:09.569
BOTH SAVE MONEY FOR DISTRICTS

01:55:09.636 --> 01:55:10.203
AND POTENTIALLY BE MORE

01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:11.571
EFFICIENT UNDER THAT DEPENDS A

01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:12.705
LITTLE BIT ON WHAT DISTRICTS DO

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:14.474
WITH SOME OF THE MONEY THAT THEY

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.109
THEY SAVE -- THERE'S ALSO YOU

01:55:16.175 --> 01:55:17.377
SEE SOME EVIDENCE THAT DISTRICTS

01:55:17.443 --> 01:55:18.978
ARE DOING SOME OF THAT SORT OF

01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:21.648
PULLING BACK A LITTLE BIT ON

01:55:21.714 --> 01:55:22.582
WHAT THEY OFFER.

01:55:22.649 --> 01:55:23.116
IN TERMS OF THEIR BENEFITS

01:55:23.182 --> 01:55:23.750
PACKAGES THIS ALSO APPEARS TO BE

01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:24.817
TRUE TO SOME EXTENT OF THESE --

01:55:24.884 --> 01:55:26.586
PET PACKAGES THAT THEY OFFER SO

01:55:26.653 --> 01:55:28.354
SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WHICH IS AS

01:55:28.421 --> 01:55:29.722
FAR BACK AS I CAN GO YOU DO SEE

01:55:29.789 --> 01:55:30.523
FEWER DISTRICTS TODAY THEY'RE

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:32.091
OFFERING THESE RETIREE HEALTH

01:55:32.158 --> 01:55:33.059
BENEFITS FOR LIFE.

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:35.361
OR TO RETIREES OVER AGE SIXTY

01:55:35.428 --> 01:55:36.763
FIVE OR EVEN TO RETIREES AT ALL

01:55:36.829 --> 01:55:38.431
AND THE PROGRAMS THEY DO OFFER

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:39.999
THESE BENEFITS OFFER THEM -- FOR

01:55:40.066 --> 01:55:41.367
THEY TEND TO EXPIRE AT SLIGHTLY

01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:42.869
YOUNGER AGES ARE AFTER A SMALLER

01:55:42.935 --> 01:55:44.337
NUMBER OF YEARS WHETHER AT LEAST

01:55:44.404 --> 01:55:46.105
PHASING THESE REQUIREMENTS IN

01:55:46.172 --> 01:55:47.473
FOR NEW TEACHERS SO ONE OF THE

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:48.441
THINGS THAT CAN MAKE NAVIGATING

01:55:48.508 --> 01:55:48.808
THESE.

01:55:48.875 --> 01:55:50.243
LARGE LIABILITIES DIFFICULT IS

01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:51.010
THAT THEY'VE OFTEN BEEN

01:55:51.077 --> 01:55:52.412
ACCUMULATED OVER MANY MANY YEARS

01:55:52.478 --> 01:55:53.846
AND IT'S DIFFICULT NOW TO COME

01:55:53.913 --> 01:55:55.848
IN AND CHANGE CHANGE THE BENEFIT

01:55:55.915 --> 01:55:56.916
PACKAGE THAT YOU'RE THE OFFERING

01:55:56.983 --> 01:55:57.884
TO TEACHERS THAT YOU PROMISED

01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:59.419
THEM MAYBE THIRTY YEARS AGO.

01:55:59.485 --> 01:56:01.087
AS THEY STARTED WORKING LIKE

01:56:01.154 --> 01:56:02.388
STEP THAT.

01:56:02.455 --> 01:56:03.089
MEAN I CAN SEE HOW.

01:56:03.156 --> 01:56:04.791
NO ACTIVE EMPLOYEES NEED HEALTH

01:56:04.857 --> 01:56:06.926
INSURANCE IN THIS PROBLEM WITH

01:56:06.993 --> 01:56:10.029
RAPIDLY ESCALATING PREMIUMS. FOR

01:56:10.096 --> 01:56:10.730
FOR HEALTH INSURANCE IS A

01:56:10.797 --> 01:56:12.799
PROBLEM THAT ALL EMPLOYERS AND

01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:14.300
EMPLOYEES SHARE AND AND IT'S

01:56:14.367 --> 01:56:15.601
JUST ONE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:56:15.668 --> 01:56:16.636
HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH.

01:56:16.703 --> 01:56:19.305
ON SORT OF A LARGE SCALE NOT

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:21.708
JUST INSIDE THE CONFINES OF THE

01:56:21.774 --> 01:56:22.675
SCHOOL DISTRICT I THINK IT'S

01:56:22.742 --> 01:56:23.676
ANOTHER ISSUE WHEN YOU TALK

01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:25.011
ABOUT POST EMPLOYMENT HEALTH

01:56:25.078 --> 01:56:29.048
BENEFITS FOR THOSE WHO ARE

01:56:29.115 --> 01:56:30.583
ELIGIBLE FOR FOR ANOTHER.

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:31.084
HEALTH PLAN PERHAPS THE

01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:32.952
GOVERNMENT HEALTH PLAN -- FOR

01:56:33.019 --> 01:56:34.821
WHICH A DISTRICT PROVIDED A PLAN

01:56:34.887 --> 01:56:36.255
COULD BE A SUPPLEMENT WHERE THE

01:56:36.322 --> 01:56:37.890
PREMIUM IS DRAMATICALLY LOWER

01:56:37.957 --> 01:56:39.525
BECAUSE OF THE OF THE INSTANCE

01:56:39.592 --> 01:56:40.927
OF USING UTILIZATION OF THE

01:56:40.993 --> 01:56:42.562
SUPPLEMENT SO.

01:56:42.628 --> 01:56:44.197
I MEAN THERE REALLY.

01:56:44.263 --> 01:56:45.465
TO SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT

01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:47.400
ISSUES ARE THERE YES EXACTLY

01:56:47.467 --> 01:56:48.534
RIGHT THAT THAT ACTIVE EMPLOYEES

01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:49.936
KNOW TYRESE ARE SEPARATE ISSUES

01:56:50.002 --> 01:56:51.137
I THINK EVEN WITH ENDING ABOUT

01:56:51.204 --> 01:56:52.672
THESE RETIREE BENEFITS THEY'RE

01:56:52.739 --> 01:56:53.506
SORT OF TWO DISTINCT ISSUES OF

01:56:53.573 --> 01:56:54.574
SORT OF MANY DISTRICTS HAVE

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:56.442
ALREADY ACCUMULATED THESE LARGE

01:56:56.509 --> 01:56:57.910
UNFUNDED LIBRARIES AND MAYBE

01:56:57.977 --> 01:56:59.045
RENEGOTIATING AS BENEFIT

01:56:59.112 --> 01:56:59.312
PACKAGES.

01:56:59.379 --> 01:57:01.714
GOING FORWARD IS NOT NECESSARILY.

01:57:01.781 --> 01:57:02.615
GOING TO HELP WITH THOSE LARGE

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:03.950
UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AND FOR

01:57:04.016 --> 01:57:04.884
EXAMPLE IS ALSO THINGS THAT

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:05.985
DISTRICTS CAN BE DOING GOING

01:57:06.052 --> 01:57:07.053
FORWARD THINGS LIKE DOING

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.354
ADDITIONAL PRE FUNDING SO

01:57:08.421 --> 01:57:09.655
DISTRICTS IN MANY CASES.

01:57:09.722 --> 01:57:11.657
ARE NOT DO NOT SET ASIDE MONEY

01:57:11.724 --> 01:57:12.792
FOR THEIR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES TO

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:14.360
PAY FOR THEIR RETIREE BENEFITS

01:57:14.427 --> 01:57:15.128
LATER YOU DO SEE A GROW

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:16.229
DISTRICTS DURING THIS

01:57:16.295 --> 01:57:17.730
INCREASINGLY PRE FUNDING THESE

01:57:17.797 --> 01:57:18.598
BENEFITS.

01:57:18.664 --> 01:57:19.499
THAT HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF A OF

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:20.900
AVOIDING THESE LARGE UNFUNDED

01:57:20.967 --> 01:57:22.568
LIABILITIES ACCUMULATING IT ALSO

01:57:22.635 --> 01:57:23.169
SAVES MONEY IN THE LONG TERM

01:57:23.236 --> 01:57:25.037
BECAUSE IF YOU SET ASIDE THE

01:57:25.104 --> 01:57:26.372
MONEY IN A TRUST AS YOUR OFTEN A

01:57:26.439 --> 01:57:28.408
COUPLE REQUIRED TO DO UNDER SOME

01:57:28.474 --> 01:57:29.776
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS -- YOU

01:57:29.842 --> 01:57:31.277
CAN ACCUMULATE INTEREST ON THOSE

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:32.211
INVESTMENTS THAT YOU CAN THEN

01:57:32.278 --> 01:57:33.746
USE TO PAY FOR A PORTION OF THE

01:57:33.813 --> 01:57:34.781
BENEFITS LATER SO BUT AGAIN

01:57:34.847 --> 01:57:35.915
THAT'S AN ISSUE GOING FORWARD

01:57:35.982 --> 01:57:37.116
AND DOESN'T NECESSARILY SOLVE

01:57:37.183 --> 01:57:38.184
THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:39.152
PROMISED A LOT OF BENEFITS

01:57:39.218 --> 01:57:39.519
ALREADY THAT.

01:57:39.585 --> 01:57:40.920
THAT MIGHT NOT YOU MIGHT NOT

01:57:40.987 --> 01:57:42.789
HAVE MONEY TO PAY.

01:57:42.855 --> 01:57:43.856
FOR THE ON THE OTHER LASTING I'D

01:57:43.923 --> 01:57:45.258
SAY FROM SORT OF A A STATE

01:57:45.324 --> 01:57:46.025
PERSPECTIVE AGAIN IT IS A

01:57:46.092 --> 01:57:46.659
FUNDING STATUS THINKING ABOUT

01:57:46.726 --> 01:57:47.860
ENGAGING WITH AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:57:47.927 --> 01:57:49.762
IS THERE SOME THINGS THAT STATE

01:57:49.829 --> 01:57:52.331
DO TO ADJUST -- FUNDING FORMULAS

01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:54.133
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:55.067
THAT -- WITH SOURCE ENTITLED

01:57:55.134 --> 01:57:56.536
GEOGRAPHIC COST TO JUST MONTH

01:57:56.602 --> 01:57:58.438
ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT -- A

01:57:58.504 --> 01:58:00.072
WORKERS IN DIFFERENT AREAS --

01:58:00.139 --> 01:58:01.641
OFTEN TO SORT OF COMMAND HIGHER

01:58:01.707 --> 01:58:02.708
SALARIES ARE HIGHER LEVELS OF

01:58:02.775 --> 01:58:03.943
COMPENSATION THIS MIGHT BE

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:05.011
PARTICULAR TO IN A PLACE LIKE

01:58:05.077 --> 01:58:05.978
CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE'S JUST A

01:58:06.045 --> 01:58:08.080
TREMENDOUS VARIATION FROM PLACE

01:58:08.147 --> 01:58:09.482
TO PLACE IN TERMS OF SORT OF

01:58:09.549 --> 01:58:11.184
WHAT A COLLEGE GRADUATE LIKE A

01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:12.485
TEACHER MIGHT EXPECT TO EARN IN

01:58:12.552 --> 01:58:13.753
THE JOB. FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:14.854
FOR EXAMPLELIKE A VERY

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:16.022
DIFFERENT KIND OF WORKER AND ONE

01:58:16.088 --> 01:58:17.423
PART OF THE STATE AND ANOTHER IN

01:58:17.490 --> 01:58:19.091
SOME STATES TO MAKE THESE SORTS

01:58:19.158 --> 01:58:20.126
OF COST ADJUSTMENTS.

01:58:20.193 --> 01:58:21.360
OF MANY OF THE DISTRICTS THAT WE

01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:22.895
SEE WITH THE HIGHEST HEALTH AND

01:58:22.962 --> 01:58:24.030
WELFARE BENEFIT COSTS OR THE

01:58:24.096 --> 01:58:25.331
LARGEST -- PEBBLE LIABILITIES

01:58:25.398 --> 01:58:27.133
ARE OFTEN IN JEEP PARTS OF

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:28.801
CALIFORNIA WHERE -- COLLEGE

01:58:28.868 --> 01:58:30.636
GRADUATES EARN HIGHER WAGES ON

01:58:30.703 --> 01:58:32.638
AVERAGE -- AND SO THOSE KINDS OF

01:58:32.705 --> 01:58:34.907
ADJUSTMENTS BUT TEND TO BENEFIT

01:58:34.974 --> 01:58:36.876
THESE DISTRICTS ON AVERAGE.

01:58:36.943 --> 01:58:38.277
AND GO BUT IT JUST IN THE

01:58:38.344 --> 01:58:40.146
FUNDING FORMULA FROM THE STATE

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:42.315
TO THE DISTRICT YEAH SO IT

01:58:42.381 --> 01:58:50.189
THERE'D AND THE YEAH SO THERE'S

01:58:50.256 --> 01:58:50.823
A THE THE STATE FUNDING FORMULA

01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:51.858
TO SOME TYPE OF ADJUSTMENTS

01:58:51.924 --> 01:58:52.692
ALREADY FOR THINGS LIKE SMALL

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:53.626
DISTRICTS AND MAKE SOME

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:54.260
ADJUSTMENTS OVER TIME SOMETHING

01:58:54.327 --> 01:58:54.894
YOU DO SEE.

01:58:54.961 --> 01:58:55.461
SOME STATES LOOKING INTO AND

01:58:55.528 --> 01:58:56.462
STARTING TO TO IMPLEMENTED ALSO

01:58:56.529 --> 01:58:57.430
GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES IN THIS

01:58:57.497 --> 01:58:57.964
SORT OF THINKING ABOUT HOW

01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:58.965
DIFFERENT -- DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:58:59.031 --> 01:58:59.899
COSTS ARE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:00.466
PARTS OF THE STATE FACTORING

01:59:00.533 --> 01:59:01.234
THAT IN -- IF IT MIGHT BE THAT

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:02.068
SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS ALSO

01:59:02.134 --> 01:59:03.202
JUST NEED TO BE OFFERING MORE

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:05.471
GENEROUS BENEFITS ANYWAY JUST

01:59:05.538 --> 01:59:06.372
BASED ON WHERE THEY ARE AND THAT

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:07.874
THE STATE WHICH IS AN EASIER

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:09.275
DECISION TO MAKE IF THERE'S

01:59:09.342 --> 01:59:12.044
ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BUCKET.

01:59:12.111 --> 01:59:12.979
OVERALL [inaudible]

01:59:13.045 --> 01:59:16.616
OTHERWISE WE'RE YEAH.

01:59:16.682 --> 01:59:17.783
SO I WITH THAT THAT'S ALSO

01:59:17.850 --> 01:59:18.818
RECOMMEND IT'LL COME IS THERE

01:59:18.885 --> 01:59:19.919
BUT AGAIN LIKE EVERYONE I'M

01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:20.720
HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ARE

01:59:20.786 --> 01:59:22.221
LOWER LOOK AND OTHER ISSUES IF

01:59:22.288 --> 01:59:24.123
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL I THINK OF

01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:26.526
AS MIND IT'S THEIR OWN YOU ANY

01:59:26.592 --> 01:59:28.394
QUESTIONS.

01:59:28.461 --> 01:59:29.195
YEAH -- WELL JUST SO YOU AND

01:59:29.262 --> 01:59:30.596
YOUR FIRST YOUR FIRST COMMENT

01:59:30.663 --> 01:59:31.764
ABOUT HOW ON THE COSTS ARE

01:59:31.831 --> 01:59:34.033
GROWING AT A FASTER CLIP IS THAT

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:35.601
IS THAT PARTLY BECAUSE OF JUST

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:38.204
THE GENERAL PHENOMENON OF HEALTH

01:59:38.271 --> 01:59:39.839
CARE COSTS.

01:59:39.906 --> 01:59:41.140
YES I'M SAY SO CLARIFY I THOUGHT

01:59:41.207 --> 01:59:42.008
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT THEY JUST

01:59:42.074 --> 01:59:42.542
TEND TO GROW THE COST OF

01:59:42.608 --> 01:59:43.309
HEALTHCARE TEND TO GROW FASTER

01:59:43.376 --> 01:59:44.577
THAN THE THAT JUST SORT OF COST

01:59:44.644 --> 01:59:46.279
IN GENERAL AND THIS IS JUST AN

01:59:46.345 --> 01:59:48.080
ACROSS THE BOARD PROBLEM THAT WE

01:59:48.147 --> 01:59:48.281
HAVE.

01:59:48.347 --> 01:59:49.448
YES IT TOO AT THE IT'S A NICE

01:59:49.515 --> 01:59:51.017
NOT LIMITED EDUCATION A

01:59:51.083 --> 01:59:55.321
CALIFORNIA BY APPOINTMENT.

01:59:55.388 --> 01:59:57.089
OKAY AND ARE YOU SEEING A AND

01:59:57.156 --> 02:00:00.493
WHAT WHAT ARE SOME.

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:01.093
CAN YOU GET I GUESS FLUSH OUT

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:02.261
ALL THAT MORE SOME OF THE BEST

02:00:02.328 --> 02:00:02.862
PRACTICES YOU'RE SEEING OUT

02:00:02.929 --> 02:00:06.165
THERE -- IN TERMS OF AND AND I

02:00:06.232 --> 02:00:08.701
I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON STATES THAT

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:11.170
REALLY DO -- YOU KNOW.

02:00:11.237 --> 02:00:12.705
HAVE.

02:00:12.772 --> 02:00:14.540
GOOD STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH

02:00:14.607 --> 02:00:15.741
THEIR WITH THEIR PUBLIC

02:00:15.808 --> 02:00:17.310
EMPLOYEES THAT DID THAT.

02:00:17.376 --> 02:00:18.477
YOU HAVE PROBABLY VALUE THE

02:00:18.544 --> 02:00:20.546
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES -- BUT ARE

02:00:20.613 --> 02:00:22.982
DOING SO IN A WAY THAT IS -- IN

02:00:23.049 --> 02:00:24.383
pA FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE YOU

02:00:24.450 --> 02:00:25.284
KNOW LIKE WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE

02:00:25.351 --> 02:00:26.953
SOME LESSONS A CALIFORNIA CAN

02:00:27.019 --> 02:00:29.188
LEARN GIVEN -- IN OUR VALUES IS

02:00:29.255 --> 02:00:29.855
STATE.

02:00:29.922 --> 02:00:31.657
I YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T WE WE

02:00:31.724 --> 02:00:33.125
WE DON'T WANT TO TURN WE WANT TO

02:00:33.192 --> 02:00:35.428
BE DRAWN FROM AND SOME STATES

02:00:35.494 --> 02:00:37.997
THAT HAVE REALLY GONE OFF THE

02:00:38.064 --> 02:00:38.631
DEEP IN TERMS OF UNDER INVESTING

02:00:38.698 --> 02:00:40.166
IN -- EDUCATION THERE AND A

02:00:40.232 --> 02:00:42.168
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES BUT BUT THAT

02:00:42.234 --> 02:00:43.703
BUT BUT THAT THAT ARE FINDING

02:00:43.769 --> 02:00:45.972
WAYS TO MAKE -- THEIR SYSTEM OR

02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:46.606
THE MORE.

02:00:46.672 --> 02:00:50.076
FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE.

02:00:50.142 --> 02:00:51.444
WAS IT FOR ME AND FOR ALL OF YOU

02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:52.211
ACTUALLY IMAGES THIS BILL ON THE

02:00:52.278 --> 02:00:53.212
ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

02:00:53.279 --> 02:00:54.246
EARLIER WITH THAN THE GENERATION

02:00:54.313 --> 02:00:57.617
FIX THAT AND AND AND ON THE

02:00:57.683 --> 02:00:58.250
ISSUES THAT YOU ALL WERE WORKING

02:00:58.317 --> 02:01:01.520
ON YES I'M OUTSIDE SO TO SAY

02:01:01.587 --> 02:01:02.355
SOMETHING I TOUCHED ON BRIEFLY

02:01:02.421 --> 02:01:03.923
ON THE HEALTH.

02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:04.924
BENEFITS SIDE IS SOMETHING THAT.

02:01:04.991 --> 02:01:06.092
AS I SAID I THINK SOME STATES

02:01:06.158 --> 02:01:09.362
HAVE SEEN IS THAT -- IF -- IF

02:01:09.428 --> 02:01:10.596
WHEN IF TEACHERS OR MAKE LARGER

02:01:10.663 --> 02:01:12.231
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEIR BENEFIT

02:01:12.298 --> 02:01:13.599
PLANS THAT BOTH SIDES DISTRICT

02:01:13.666 --> 02:01:14.734
MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE THE AND

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.102
THE THE TEACHERS ARE PAYING SOME

02:01:16.168 --> 02:01:17.903
OF THE BENEFIT COSTS AND IT ALSO.

02:01:17.970 --> 02:01:19.105
MEANS THAT THEY TEND OP FOR

02:01:19.171 --> 02:01:20.339
CHEAPER PLANS SO ONE OF THE

02:01:20.406 --> 02:01:21.340
UPSHOT OF THAT IS IT CAN HELP

02:01:21.407 --> 02:01:22.708
THE DISTRICT NAVIGATE THESE

02:01:22.775 --> 02:01:24.610
BECAUSE IT'S ALSO POTENTIALLY.

02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:25.544
FOR IT MIGHT BE FOR MANY

02:01:25.611 --> 02:01:27.380
TEACHERS ALSO MORE ATTRACTIVE IN

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:29.815
SOME CASES BECAUSE IT DEPENDING

02:01:29.882 --> 02:01:30.850
ON IF DISTRICTS TAKE THEIR

02:01:30.916 --> 02:01:31.984
SAVINGS AND GIVE IT TO TEACHERS

02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:33.285
BACK IN THE FORM OF SALARY FOR

02:01:33.352 --> 02:01:34.787
EXAMPLE TEACHERS MY STILL AT THE

02:01:34.854 --> 02:01:36.222
OPTION IF THEY WANT TO TAKE

02:01:36.288 --> 02:01:38.057
THEIR THEIR SALARY COMPENSATION --

02:01:38.124 --> 02:01:39.659
AND THEN AND THEN YOU MORE

02:01:39.725 --> 02:01:40.960
FLEXIBILITY AND USE IT TO BUY

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:42.461
THE SAME BENEFIT PACKAGE IF

02:01:42.528 --> 02:01:43.095
THEY'RE IF THEY'RE SO INCLINED

02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:45.064
OR NOT.

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:45.665
I AM A WHY THERE'S SO MUCH

02:01:45.731 --> 02:01:52.238
RELUCTANCE TO THAT SORT OF THING

02:01:52.304 --> 02:01:54.206
WAIT WITH IT.

02:01:54.273 --> 02:01:55.041
ON THE OTHER SIDE AMERICAN I CAN

02:01:55.107 --> 02:01:55.975
ANSWER SORT OF HERE SORT OF IN A

02:01:56.042 --> 02:01:57.143
GENERAL WAY I THINK IT VARIES A

02:01:57.209 --> 02:01:57.910
LOT DEPENDING ON PROJECT IN A

02:01:57.977 --> 02:01:58.511
PLACE LIKE CALIFORNIA WITH SO

02:01:58.577 --> 02:01:59.078
MANY DISTRICT WITH SO MANY

02:01:59.145 --> 02:01:59.712
DIFFERENT NEEDS I THINK IT'S A

02:01:59.779 --> 02:02:01.814
COMBINATION OF DISTRICTS IN

02:02:01.881 --> 02:02:02.648
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE.

02:02:02.715 --> 02:02:03.516
HAVING DIFFERENT NEEDS IN TERMS

02:02:03.582 --> 02:02:04.650
OF HOW THEY NEED TO COMPENSATE

02:02:04.717 --> 02:02:06.052
EMPLOYEES OR THE KINDS OF

02:02:06.118 --> 02:02:06.919
PACKAGES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:02:06.986 --> 02:02:08.354
INHERITED OVER TIME BUT I CAN'T

02:02:08.421 --> 02:02:09.755
SPEAK DIRECTLY TO SORT OF WHY

02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:11.590
INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS IN MAKING

02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:12.825
THAT THE CHOICES THAT THEY MAKE

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:13.125
[inaudible]

02:02:13.192 --> 02:02:17.129
ON OKAY HAVE YOU SEEN ANY

02:02:17.196 --> 02:02:19.165
DISTRICT ANY OF YOU GUYS SEEN DO

02:02:19.231 --> 02:02:20.132
YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THE

02:02:20.199 --> 02:02:21.600
INTERCHANGE THAT WE HAD EARLIER

02:02:21.667 --> 02:02:24.203
WITH MR FIND OF YOU KNOW ABOUT

02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:25.805
HOW DISTRICTS ARE.

02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:26.572
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY DISTRICTS THAT

02:02:26.639 --> 02:02:28.140
HAVE THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY

02:02:28.207 --> 02:02:31.610
FOUND A WAY -- TO YOU KNOW TO TO

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:35.715
TRANSITION -- THERE HAVE

02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:37.149
LIABILITIES.

02:02:37.216 --> 02:02:38.784
TO BETTER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

02:02:38.851 --> 02:02:40.252
EXISTING.

02:02:40.319 --> 02:02:41.787
INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THERE WHETHER

02:02:41.854 --> 02:02:44.023
BE MEDICARE COVER CALIFORNIA ACA

02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:45.624
AT BUT DO SO IN A WAY THAT

02:02:45.691 --> 02:02:47.693
REALLY -- YOU KNOW BECAME A IN

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:49.695
WIN FOR THEIR BOTH THEIR

02:02:49.762 --> 02:02:51.363
RETIREES AND THEIR CURRENT

02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:53.199
EMPLOYEES WHO COULD THEN REAP

02:02:53.265 --> 02:02:56.402
THE WINDFALL OF THE SAVE MY NEED.

02:02:56.469 --> 02:02:57.770
THAT MONEY COULD BE ROLLED INTO.

02:02:57.837 --> 02:02:59.238
CLASS SIZE REDUCTIONS AND SALARY

02:02:59.305 --> 02:03:00.506
INCREASES AT OTHER GOOD EXAMPLES

02:03:00.573 --> 02:03:02.108
OUT THERE OF FOLKS WHO FOUND A

02:03:02.174 --> 02:03:03.075
WAY.

02:03:03.142 --> 02:03:04.877
TO MAKE THIS CHANGE IN IN A WAY

02:03:04.944 --> 02:03:05.511
THAT COULD BE A WIN WIN FOR THE

02:03:05.578 --> 02:03:13.552
DISTRICT.

02:03:13.619 --> 02:03:14.920
HI COULD SOMEONE COULD GIVE ME

02:03:14.987 --> 02:03:16.422
MORE VERSUS THE WIRING TO SEEMS

02:03:16.489 --> 02:03:17.256
TO ME TO BE -- I'LL TAKE A STEP

02:03:17.323 --> 02:03:18.457
SO I I THINK THE PROBLEM IS IT'S

02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:19.792
VERY HARD TO TRACE SO IN THE

02:03:19.859 --> 02:03:20.960
PENSIONS SPACE THERE ARE A

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:23.662
NUMBER OF STATES THAT HAVE DONE

02:03:23.729 --> 02:03:24.263
THINGS TO REDUCE THEIR PENSION

02:03:24.330 --> 02:03:24.497
COSTS.

02:03:24.563 --> 02:03:26.398
AND I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT

02:03:26.465 --> 02:03:27.833
THAT SOME OF THAT SAVINGS IS

02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:29.135
GONNA HIGHER TEACHER SALARIES

02:03:29.201 --> 02:03:31.437
BUT IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO

02:03:31.504 --> 02:03:33.205
FIND THAT NUMBER.

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:34.807
THE BUDGETS ARE VERY COMPLICATED

02:03:34.874 --> 02:03:36.041
SAID A PENSION COSTS HAVE GONE

02:03:36.108 --> 02:03:37.309
DOWN AND MAYBE SALARIES HAVE

02:03:37.376 --> 02:03:37.810
GOTTEN BETTER BUT IT'S

02:03:37.877 --> 02:03:39.078
IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT SALARIES

02:03:39.145 --> 02:03:40.179
WOULD HAVE BEEN.

02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:41.046
IF THEY DIDN'T LOWER THEIR

02:03:41.113 --> 02:03:43.215
PENSION COSTS.

02:03:43.282 --> 02:03:44.450
AND SO YOU KNOW NO ONE SITTING

02:03:44.517 --> 02:03:45.518
ON THE BUDGET SAY OKAY HERE'S

02:03:45.584 --> 02:03:46.685
THE PENSION SAVINGS WHEN I PUT

02:03:46.752 --> 02:03:48.154
IT RIGHT INTO SALARIES.

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:49.522
YOU KNOW IN MARKING OUT AND READ

02:03:49.588 --> 02:03:50.756
FOR US TO SEE ON THE BUDGET SO.

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:52.024
I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO

02:03:52.091 --> 02:03:53.325
TRACE WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING

02:03:53.392 --> 02:03:55.027
BACK I I WILL SAY YOU KNOW

02:03:55.094 --> 02:03:55.961
THERE'S A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE

02:03:56.028 --> 02:03:57.329
I GET UP A COULD NOT BE PART OF

02:03:57.396 --> 02:03:58.564
A OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:03:58.631 --> 02:03:59.899
PROCESS WHERE IT WHERE.

02:03:59.965 --> 02:04:01.267
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:04:01.333 --> 02:04:02.501
DIRECT NEXUS YOU KNOW THAT THE

02:04:02.568 --> 02:04:03.469
OKAY WE'RE GONNA MAKE THESE

02:04:03.536 --> 02:04:04.670
CHANGES HERE AND THEN HERE'S

02:04:04.737 --> 02:04:06.972
WHAT THE DISTRICT'S GONNA DO.

02:04:07.039 --> 02:04:08.741
ON THIS END AND THAT'S A VERY

02:04:08.808 --> 02:04:09.341
REASONABLE TO ME BUT I HAVE NO

02:04:09.408 --> 02:04:10.509
EXPERTISE TO SAY WHY THAT

02:04:10.576 --> 02:04:11.443
DOESN'T HAPPEN MORE BUT CLEARLY

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:12.211
SOMETHING THERE SOMETHING

02:04:12.278 --> 02:04:13.879
INHIBITING THAT RIGHT BUT IT

02:04:13.946 --> 02:04:14.713
SEEMS SENSIBLE TO ME WHAT YOU

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:15.014
JUST SAID.

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.582
WE KNOW WE WE COULD SOMEBODY

02:04:16.649 --> 02:04:18.050
COULD CALCULATE THAT JUST IF I

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:20.719
COULD JUMP AND SOMEBODY COULD

02:04:20.786 --> 02:04:21.854
CALCULATE THE DIFFERENCE IN.

02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:23.556
IN TOTAL COST FOR A POST

02:04:23.622 --> 02:04:24.890
RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF FOR

02:04:24.957 --> 02:04:26.559
SOMEONE WHO SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF

02:04:26.625 --> 02:04:28.160
AGE AND OLDER. FOR HEALTH

02:04:28.227 --> 02:04:30.963
PREMIUM VERSUS MEDICARE AND THE

02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:32.631
COST OF A SUPPLEMENT AND YOU

02:04:32.698 --> 02:04:33.899
COULD COME UP YOU WOULDN'T IT

02:04:33.966 --> 02:04:35.935
WOULDN'T BE SO EXACT SCIENCE BUT

02:04:36.001 --> 02:04:37.403
YOU KNOW WHAT THE DELTA IS.

02:04:37.469 --> 02:04:39.371
AND PRESUMABLY THE DELTA IS

02:04:39.438 --> 02:04:41.307
GOING TO GO TO SOMETHING.

02:04:41.373 --> 02:04:41.807
IT'S EITHER GOING TO GO

02:04:41.874 --> 02:04:43.108
CORRECTION SALARIES AND BENEFITS

02:04:43.175 --> 02:04:45.311
WHO ARE ACTIVE EMPLOYEES OR IT'S

02:04:45.377 --> 02:04:46.212
GOING TO GO TO SOMETHING ELSE

02:04:46.278 --> 02:04:46.745
RIGHT.

02:04:46.812 --> 02:04:48.214
BUT I GUESS NOBODY'S DONE THAT

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:50.516
SORT OF ANNOUNCEMENT COULD ALL

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:52.384
BE DONE AS PART OF A YOU KNOW

02:04:52.451 --> 02:04:53.519
BUT PARTY PROCESS FOR YOU CAN

02:04:53.586 --> 02:04:54.720
COME BACK TO YOU JUST CAME UP I

02:04:54.787 --> 02:04:55.654
THINK WAS SACRAMENTO SAID YOU

02:04:55.721 --> 02:04:56.755
GUYS WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW

02:04:56.822 --> 02:04:58.791
THEY HAVE TO DO THIS REDUCTION

02:04:58.858 --> 02:04:58.958
IN.

02:04:59.024 --> 02:05:00.526
COSTS BUT THEY ENDED THE

02:05:00.593 --> 02:05:01.760
TEACHERS UNION WANTS THE MONEY

02:05:01.827 --> 02:05:03.095
TO GO TO CERTAIN THINGS IN THE

02:05:03.162 --> 02:05:05.130
DISTRICTS AS WE JUST NEED THE

02:05:05.197 --> 02:05:05.631
MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE IN A

02:05:05.698 --> 02:05:06.999
FINANCIAL CRISIS.

02:05:07.066 --> 02:05:08.267
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE KIND OF

02:05:08.334 --> 02:05:09.902
SCENARIO THAT PLAYED OUT WITH.

02:05:09.969 --> 02:05:10.369
THAT.

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:11.737
I SESSION SPECULATE TOO MUCH

02:05:11.804 --> 02:05:12.838
RIGHT MANAGEMENT WOULD HAVE TO

02:05:12.905 --> 02:05:14.306
THE DESTROYED A LOCAL DISTRICT

02:05:14.373 --> 02:05:15.674
THAT HAS ONE OF THESE POST

02:05:15.741 --> 02:05:17.243
RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IF.

02:05:17.309 --> 02:05:18.577
IF THEY SUFFERED SOMEBODY WOULD

02:05:18.644 --> 02:05:21.747
HAVE TO TAKE THE CALCULATOR RUN

02:05:21.814 --> 02:05:22.681
THE NUMBER.

02:05:22.748 --> 02:05:23.649
AND SAY HERE'S WHAT THE DELTA IS

02:05:23.716 --> 02:05:24.817
AND THEN PUT THE MONEY ON THE

02:05:24.884 --> 02:05:26.151
TABLE HAVE A CONTRACT

02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:28.454
NEGOTIATION AND EITHER THEY HAVE

02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:29.855
IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL OR

02:05:29.922 --> 02:05:31.357
NOBODY'S BOTHERED SO.

02:05:31.423 --> 02:05:32.191
I THINK THE RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE

02:05:32.258 --> 02:05:33.859
GETTING MY HOPE POINT IS THAT

02:05:33.926 --> 02:05:34.927
YOU THE CLIP YOU THE THE

02:05:34.994 --> 02:05:36.262
BARGAINING UNIT WOULD ONLY

02:05:36.328 --> 02:05:37.830
PERSONALLY FIND AS ATTRACTIVE AS

02:05:37.897 --> 02:05:40.132
AN OPTION IF A WE WERE VERY

02:05:40.199 --> 02:05:42.468
CLEAR ABOUT GUARANTEEING.

02:05:42.534 --> 02:05:45.371
YOU KNOW OF OF OF OF OF

02:05:45.437 --> 02:05:48.040
SUBSTANTIVELY -- YOU KNOW EQUAL

02:05:48.107 --> 02:05:49.575
LEVEL SERVICE FOR THE RETIREES

02:05:49.642 --> 02:05:50.276
PLUS.

02:05:50.342 --> 02:05:52.144
OF A YOU KNOW A DIRECT NEXUS

02:05:52.211 --> 02:05:54.546
BETWEEN THOSE COST SAVINGS AND

02:05:54.613 --> 02:05:55.948
SUPPORT FOR THE EMPLOYEES

02:05:56.015 --> 02:05:57.182
THROUGH.

02:05:57.249 --> 02:05:59.118
YOU KNOW HIRING MORE FOLKS AND

02:05:59.184 --> 02:05:59.485
PEOPLE BETTER.

02:05:59.551 --> 02:06:01.420
SO BUT BUT THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME

02:06:01.487 --> 02:06:02.855
TO BE SOMETHING THAT.

02:06:02.922 --> 02:06:03.589
WE SHOULD WILL FIND OME COMMON

02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:04.957
GROUND ON GIVEN I MEAN THAT WAS

02:06:05.024 --> 02:06:06.659
THE WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:06:06.725 --> 02:06:07.760
THAT I'VE BEEN SEEING WITH THE

02:06:07.826 --> 02:06:08.961
RIGHTS OF THE STRIKES PEOPLE

02:06:09.028 --> 02:06:10.195
BEING UPSET ABOUT.

02:06:10.262 --> 02:06:12.264
THE LACK OF ADEQUATE NURSES IN

02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:13.799
LIBRARIANS IN CLASS SIZE IS

02:06:13.866 --> 02:06:16.368
GOING THROUGH THE ROOF AND

02:06:16.435 --> 02:06:18.237
THAT'S HOW YOU FIND MORE MONEY

02:06:18.304 --> 02:06:18.804
AND YOU DO SO IN A WAY THAT

02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:20.039
DOESN'T YOU KNOW.

02:06:20.105 --> 02:06:23.008
ATRAER RETIREES.

02:06:23.075 --> 02:06:23.842
I MEAN YOU GUYS ARE ALL KIND OF

02:06:23.909 --> 02:06:25.477
NODDING TO ME BUT I BUT I GUESS

02:06:25.544 --> 02:06:26.578
'M I'M WHAT.

02:06:26.645 --> 02:06:29.481
THE GIVEN HOW HOW HOT THIS IS

02:06:29.548 --> 02:06:32.384
GETTING WHY WHY AREN'T WE WHAT

02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:34.954
WHY IS IN THIS BEING MORE WHY IN

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:36.422
THIS OF OF A MORE.

02:06:36.488 --> 02:06:38.023
INTENSE CONVERSATION GOING ON AT

02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:39.558
THE LOCAL LEVEL LIKE WHAT WHAT'S

02:06:39.625 --> 02:06:41.126
WHAT'S WHAT'S STANDING IN THE

02:06:41.193 --> 02:06:41.860
WAY WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP

02:06:41.927 --> 02:06:42.161
[inaudible]

02:06:42.227 --> 02:06:43.696
PUSHED ALONG.

02:06:43.762 --> 02:06:45.130
SO MY MY NOT IT IS BECAUSE OF

02:06:45.197 --> 02:06:46.298
THEIR THERE'S ACTUALLY GOOD

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:46.832
EVIDENCE IN THE RESEARCH

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:48.033
LITERATURE THAT THE TEACHERS

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:49.902
DON'T VALUE THE COST OF THEIR

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:51.170
PENSIONS.

02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:52.538
AT THE FULL COST AT AT WHAT IT

02:06:52.604 --> 02:06:53.839
COSTS THAT TIPPER TO PROVIDE

02:06:53.906 --> 02:06:54.873
THEM IN TERMS OF THEY'D RATHER

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:57.443
HAVE MORE RESOURCES SHIFTED THE

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:58.978
CURRENT SALARIES AND SO.

02:06:59.044 --> 02:06:59.778
AND AND I'M GONNA DETAILS

02:06:59.845 --> 02:07:01.480
WHETHER I I THINK THERE'S SOME

02:07:01.547 --> 02:07:02.147
COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S

02:07:02.214 --> 02:07:04.283
TRUE SO THE ANSWER TO YOUR

02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:05.884
QUESTION MUST BE A POLITICAL

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:07.553
CONSTRAINTS AND AND AND WERE OUT

02:07:07.619 --> 02:07:09.088
OF MY AREA OF EXPERTISE FINAL TO

02:07:09.154 --> 02:07:11.190
TELL YOU BUT ALL THE EVIDENCE ON

02:07:11.256 --> 02:07:13.559
THE TABLE SUGGEST THAT A DEAL.

02:07:13.625 --> 02:07:14.860
LIKE THAT.

02:07:14.927 --> 02:07:15.461
EVERYONE SHOULD BE WILLING TO

02:07:15.527 --> 02:07:16.362
COME TO THE TABLE TO TALK ABOUT

02:07:16.428 --> 02:07:17.796
THAT SO THERE SOME ASPECT OF THE

02:07:17.863 --> 02:07:20.199
POLITICAL PROCESS THAT'S THAT'S

02:07:20.265 --> 02:07:21.967
INHIBITING THINGS IS IS MY ONLY

02:07:22.034 --> 02:07:24.470
RESPONSE.

02:07:24.536 --> 02:07:25.571
CAN YOU SPECULATE IT FURTHER I

02:07:25.637 --> 02:07:27.606
MEAN YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:28.207
YOU'RE NOT POLITICIZE THIS BUT

02:07:28.273 --> 02:07:29.441
LIKE.

02:07:29.508 --> 02:07:31.176
WHAT'S GOING BUT WHEN MY MISSING

02:07:31.243 --> 02:07:32.511
HERE WITH WHAT YOU KNOW AND

02:07:32.578 --> 02:07:33.779
ESPECIALLY ON THINK THIS THAT

02:07:33.846 --> 02:07:34.913
YOU JUST RAISED.

02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:35.481
IF THE EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES

02:07:35.547 --> 02:07:36.682
WOULD RATHER.

02:07:36.749 --> 02:07:37.983
HAVE A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE

02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:38.283
[inaudible]

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:41.220
THE I'M NOT AYE THIS IS NOT MY

02:07:41.286 --> 02:07:42.454
AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT I'M NOT

02:07:42.521 --> 02:07:44.690
SURE IF THAT'S A GENERALITY I

02:07:44.757 --> 02:07:47.326
MEAN YEAH -- I CAN SEE THAT THAT --

02:07:47.393 --> 02:07:50.529
NEWER TEACHERS FOR FOR LIQUIDITY.

02:07:50.596 --> 02:07:52.531
AND AND WOULD LIKE MORE OF THEIR

02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:54.299
COMPENSATION PACKAGE LOWER THAN

02:07:54.366 --> 02:07:55.634
THE SALARY. NINE AS YOU GET

02:07:55.701 --> 02:07:57.169
OLDER AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A

02:07:57.236 --> 02:07:58.704
FAMILY I MEAN I I GUESS IS

02:07:58.771 --> 02:08:00.739
VARIATION THERE BUT COR YOU KNOW

02:08:00.806 --> 02:08:01.373
THIS MUCH BETTER THAN I DO THE

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:02.608
STUDY I'M REFERRING TO ACTUALLY

02:08:02.674 --> 02:08:03.909
LOOKS OLDER TEACHERS AND SO

02:08:03.976 --> 02:08:05.444
OFTEN IS AS EVEN THE MORE TRUE

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:07.079
FOR YOUNGER TEACHERS -- YEAH

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:08.947
OKAY INTERESTING OKAY THE

02:08:09.014 --> 02:08:10.749
PENSIONS ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.

02:08:10.816 --> 02:08:13.419
AT SURELY THE VALUE THE IDEA

02:08:13.485 --> 02:08:14.686
THAT THEY CAN HAVE RETIREMENT

02:08:14.753 --> 02:08:16.021
ABSOLUTE THAT'S AB.

02:08:16.088 --> 02:08:17.923
SO IT THAT IS SO THAT THE STUDY

02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.524
I'M THINKING OF IS IN ILLINOIS

02:08:18.590 --> 02:08:19.925
AND THERE'S A REALLY GENEROUS

02:08:19.992 --> 02:08:20.659
PENSIONS FOR THE TEACHERS THERE

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:22.227
AND YOU GET A TON OF MONEY

02:08:22.294 --> 02:08:23.495
RETIREMENT AND THERE IS AN

02:08:23.562 --> 02:08:25.097
OPPORTUNITY TO BUY BACK TO BUY

02:08:25.164 --> 02:08:26.999
MUCH BETTER PENSIONS.

02:08:27.066 --> 02:08:28.133
BUT THE PRICING CURRENT SALARY

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:29.835
TEACHERS WILLING TO PAY WAS FAR

02:08:29.902 --> 02:08:31.470
LESS THAN WHAT IT COST TO

02:08:31.537 --> 02:08:32.371
PROVIDE THOSE BENEFITS.

02:08:32.438 --> 02:08:38.143
BUT IS THAT MAYBE THAT HAS MORE

02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:39.511
TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT.

02:08:39.578 --> 02:08:40.646
PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE COSTS ARE AS

02:08:40.712 --> 02:08:41.413
THEIR THEIR EVENT HORIZONS ARE

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:42.247
NOT THAT FAR SO AS YOU WE WANT

02:08:42.314 --> 02:08:43.882
LIQUIDITY NOW RATHER THAN LATER

02:08:43.949 --> 02:08:44.583
YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING THAT

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:45.150
WRAPS IT SO THE WAY THAT THE

02:08:45.217 --> 02:08:47.686
PERSON TO THAT'S THEY DESCRIBE

02:08:47.753 --> 02:08:49.321
IT IS THAT -- ARGUMENT WAS THAT

02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:50.289
TEACHERS IN PUBLIC SECTOR

02:08:50.355 --> 02:08:50.889
EMPLOYEE PLAYS WERE GENERALLY

02:08:50.956 --> 02:08:51.690
ARE ARE OVER SATURATED WITH

02:08:51.757 --> 02:08:53.525
PENSION WELL.

02:08:53.592 --> 02:08:54.426
SO ON THE MARGIN SO THEY DON'T

02:08:54.493 --> 02:08:55.627
VALUE THEIR POTENTIAL THEIR

02:08:55.694 --> 02:08:56.962
PENSIONS ARE JUST SO GENEROUS.

02:08:57.029 --> 02:08:58.564
THE RALLY RELATIVE TO THE

02:08:58.630 --> 02:08:59.398
RETIREMENT OF A LOT OF OTHER

02:08:59.465 --> 02:09:01.066
PEOPLE THAT ON THE MARGIN NEED

02:09:01.133 --> 02:09:03.035
RATHER PULL SOME OF THAT MONEY

02:09:03.102 --> 02:09:04.436
FORWARD IF THEY CRIED AND THERE

02:09:04.503 --> 02:09:05.204

GETTING RELATIVELY LOWER PAY

02:09:06.772 --> 02:09:07.806
THAN OTHER PROFESSIONALS AT

02:09:07.873 --> 02:09:09.575
RIGHT HANDED RATHER RE BALANCE

02:09:09.641 --> 02:09:13.378
OUT A LITTLE ABOUT ANYTHING

02:09:13.445 --> 02:09:13.946
THAT'S THAT'S THE ARGUMENT I

02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:14.379

RIGHT NOW BUT THE ISSUE OF A

02:10:07.199 --> 02:10:08.867
SPECIAL ED FINANCES BECAUSE AS A

SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER YOU KNOW.

02:10:09.801 --> 02:10:10.969
IT'S BECOME AN ENORMOUS

02:10:11.036 --> 02:10:12.204
CHALLENGE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:10:12.271 --> 02:10:14.239
AND ANOTHER REAL GROWING COST

02:10:14.306 --> 02:10:15.507
PRESSURE.

02:10:15.574 --> 02:10:17.209
AND THAT IS CONTINUE TO GROW AT

02:10:17.276 --> 02:10:18.443
A AT A RATE.

02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:21.647
MIRRORS THE THE THAT THAT KIND

02:10:21.713 --> 02:10:23.882
OF IT THE BENEFITS LIABILITIES

02:10:23.949 --> 02:10:25.284
THAT EVERYONE'S TAKEN ON AND AND

02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:26.285
THAT HAS TO DO WITH FEDERAL LAW

02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:27.619
AND AND THE FACT THE PHONE

02:10:27.686 --> 02:10:29.888
GOVERNMENT'S REFUSED TO FIND --

02:10:29.955 --> 02:10:31.757
ID A EVEN A CLOSE TO WHAT THEY

02:10:31.823 --> 02:10:35.027
PROMISED INITIALLY LET ALONE THE

02:10:35.093 --> 02:10:38.430
FULL COST -- BUT YOU KNOW AND

02:10:38.497 --> 02:10:40.132
WATCH THIS SPACE BECAUSE THIS IS

02:10:40.199 --> 02:10:40.933
CERTAINLY AN AREA THAT I'M THE

02:10:40.999 --> 02:10:42.501
RESPECT OF TIME ON MIGHT IT

02:10:42.568 --> 02:10:43.802
MIGHT I JUST ADD IN ADDITION TO

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:45.737
THE THE THE UNDERFUNDING OF IDA

02:10:45.804 --> 02:10:46.405
THEIR THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW MADE

02:10:46.471 --> 02:10:48.207
ITS FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND

02:10:48.273 --> 02:10:49.408
MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT.

02:10:49.474 --> 02:10:51.510
THAT THEY THE SPENDING ON

02:10:51.577 --> 02:10:53.412
SPECIAL EDUCATION THE STICK.

02:10:53.478 --> 02:10:55.647
RIGHT RIGHT SO SO -- I MEAN

02:10:55.714 --> 02:10:57.549
THERE'S GOOD REASONS FOR FOR A

02:10:57.616 --> 02:10:58.483
LOT OF THIS AS WELL BUT DON'T

02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:00.219
WANT TO ALLOW.

02:11:00.285 --> 02:11:02.054
DESTRUCTIVE JUST DROP.

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:03.822
DROP FUNDING FOR NO REASON.

02:11:03.889 --> 02:11:06.792
BUT BUT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT I

02:11:06.858 --> 02:11:07.593
THINK WE JUST WANT TO HAVE A

02:11:07.659 --> 02:11:09.494
SYSTEM THAT BETTER REFLECTS THE

02:11:09.561 --> 02:11:11.530
COSTS ASSOCIATED.

02:11:11.597 --> 02:11:12.331
IT WILL HAVE A WE'RE GOING TO

02:11:12.397 --> 02:11:13.632
HAVE THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL HAVE

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:15.801
ANOTHER HEARING THAT -- AT LEAST

02:11:15.867 --> 02:11:18.170
IN PART FOCUSES ON SPECIAL

02:11:18.237 --> 02:11:20.572
INTEGRATION AND I'LL INVITE MY

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.808
COLLEAGUES TO PLEASE.

02:11:22.874 --> 02:11:23.475
THAT THAT SURVEYS.

02:11:23.542 --> 02:11:24.509
YEAH I WANNA BRING THE THANK YOU

02:11:24.576 --> 02:11:26.912
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HONORING THE

02:11:26.979 --> 02:11:27.446
ISSUE BACK TO THE ISSUE OF

02:11:27.512 --> 02:11:29.047
PENSIONS -- AND OBVIOUSLY IN

02:11:29.114 --> 02:11:30.816
STATE GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS

02:11:30.882 --> 02:11:32.684
WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM -- THAT

02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:33.252
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THE

02:11:33.318 --> 02:11:34.052
SCHOOLS.

02:11:34.119 --> 02:11:35.787
SO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:11:35.854 --> 02:11:37.623
HAS A INNOVATIVE WAY OF TRYING

02:11:37.689 --> 02:11:38.724
TO DEAL WITH IT.

02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:40.025
THEY HAVE CREATED AND AN

02:11:40.092 --> 02:11:42.027
OPTIONAL MATTER REQUIRED AND

02:11:42.094 --> 02:11:43.895
OPTIONAL FOR A ONE K.. FOR NEW

02:11:43.962 --> 02:11:47.666
EMPLOYEES -- THAT THAT.

02:11:47.733 --> 02:11:48.767
THE SOME OF THE CALCULATIONS OF

02:11:48.834 --> 02:11:50.002
IN NATURE THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA

02:11:50.068 --> 02:11:52.371
CHANGE JOBS IN TEN OR FIFTEEN

02:11:52.437 --> 02:11:55.307
YEARS YOU'D BE BETTER OFF.

02:11:55.374 --> 02:11:57.643
IN GETTING THAT MONEY BACK.

02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:59.845
SOME SORT OF A MATCH -- AND BE

02:11:59.911 --> 02:12:02.180
ABLE TO INVESTED ON YOUR OWN --

02:12:02.247 --> 02:12:04.316
ADDED AND THAT WOULD BE BETTER

02:12:04.383 --> 02:12:05.484
OFF FOR THE EMPLOYEES SO YOU

02:12:05.550 --> 02:12:06.918
WERE TO CALIFORNIA OFFERED THIS

02:12:06.985 --> 02:12:08.086
I GUESS THREE YEARS AGO.

02:12:08.153 --> 02:12:10.088
AND THAT THE INFORMATION I GET

02:12:10.155 --> 02:12:11.723
IS THAT 40%.

02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:14.059
OF ABOUT 40% OF THE NEW

02:12:14.126 --> 02:12:15.694
EMPLOYEES ARE PICKING.

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:18.463
THAT FOUR OH ONE K. OPTION. FOUR

02:12:18.530 --> 02:12:20.766
THAT'S A LOT NOW.

02:12:20.832 --> 02:12:21.800
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:23.101
LIMITATIONS THAT SCHOOL

02:12:23.168 --> 02:12:24.636
DISTRICTS BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:12:24.703 --> 02:12:26.305
THAT SAME OPTION. FOR NEW

02:12:26.371 --> 02:12:28.140
EMPLOYEES AND MAYBE YOU COULD

02:12:28.206 --> 02:12:29.775
SPEAK TO THAT.

02:12:29.841 --> 02:12:31.376
YEAH SURE SO I WILL ALSO SAY SO

02:12:31.443 --> 02:12:32.344
THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES

02:12:32.411 --> 02:12:34.046
OF K. TWELVE TEACHERS THAT MERE

02:12:34.112 --> 02:12:36.014
THAT SAME RESULTS OF FLORIDA

02:12:36.081 --> 02:12:37.549
COME TO TOP MY MIND THEY HAVE A

02:12:37.616 --> 02:12:38.884
CHOICE TEACHERS CAN CHOOSE WHICH

02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:41.753
PLAN A ONE I BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT.

02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:42.721
FIFTY FIFTY WOULD CHOOSE THE

02:12:42.788 --> 02:12:44.122
FOUR OH ONE K. TYPE PLAN VERSUS

02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:45.891
DEFINED BENEFIT -- SO I DO THINK

02:12:45.957 --> 02:12:47.326
THERE'S A LOT OF DEMAND THE

02:12:47.392 --> 02:12:48.393
WORKFORCE IS DIVERSE YOUR POINT

02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:49.561
ABOUT YOUNG WORKERS I THINK IT'S

02:12:49.628 --> 02:12:50.996
QUITE WELL ESTABLISHED IF YOU'RE

02:12:51.063 --> 02:12:52.097
NOT GONNA STAY IN IN THESE

02:12:52.164 --> 02:12:53.398
POSITIONS FOR A FULL CAREER

02:12:53.465 --> 02:12:56.668
YOU'RE BETTER OFF GETTING A FOUR

02:12:56.735 --> 02:12:57.703
ONE K. TYPE PLANTS.

02:12:57.769 --> 02:12:58.837
RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO WAY YOU

02:12:58.904 --> 02:13:00.706
CAN'T.

02:13:00.772 --> 02:13:02.107
THERE'S NO THESE IT'S A STATE

02:13:02.174 --> 02:13:04.209
LAW DAY STATE POLICY TO EL ALL

02:13:04.276 --> 02:13:04.876
THE TEACHERS HAVE TO BE ENROLLED

02:13:04.943 --> 02:13:05.711
IN CAL STIRS.

02:13:05.777 --> 02:13:06.878
SO THERE HAVE TO BE A CHANGE TO

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.213
STATE LAWS MY UNDERSTANDING IN

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:09.648
ORDER TO ALLOW MAKE THIS

02:13:09.715 --> 02:13:11.149
POSSIBLE BUT THE NUMBER OF

02:13:11.216 --> 02:13:12.451
STATES HAVE DONE THIS.

02:13:12.517 --> 02:13:14.720
THE SOMEONE SUGGEST THAT -- IF

02:13:14.786 --> 02:13:16.254
THAT LAW WERE TO BE ENACTED.

02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:17.189
THAT YOU WOULD JEOPARDIZE

02:13:17.255 --> 02:13:18.924
CHARACTERS BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT

02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:19.858
BE GETTING THOSE WE WERE

02:13:19.925 --> 02:13:21.626
CONTRIBUTIONS INTO THE SYSTEM

02:13:21.693 --> 02:13:22.928
WOULD THAT BE YOUR ANALYSIS.

02:13:22.994 --> 02:13:24.496
I THINK I THINK THAT'S A FALSE

02:13:24.563 --> 02:13:27.232
ARGUMENT -- BECAUSE THE PLAN THE

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:28.200
SYSTEM IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

02:13:28.266 --> 02:13:30.502
DESIGNED TO HAVE THAT THE SYSTEM

02:13:30.569 --> 02:13:31.937
IS SUPPOSED TO BE COURT FUNDED

02:13:32.003 --> 02:13:33.038
EVERY FOR EVERY YEAR IBM THE

02:13:33.105 --> 02:13:34.239
FULL BENEFITS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

02:13:34.306 --> 02:13:37.776
PAID BY THEMSELVES IS NOT

02:13:37.843 --> 02:13:39.678
SUPPOSED TO BE A PAY GO SYSTEM.

02:13:39.745 --> 02:13:40.479
ANOTHER WAY TO STATUS IS THERE'S

02:13:40.545 --> 02:13:41.947
AT THAT POINT PROBLEM RIGHT NOW

02:13:42.013 --> 02:13:42.581
BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA'S SORT OF

02:13:42.647 --> 02:13:43.448
YOU CAN IMAGINE ANALOGY TO DIG A

02:13:43.515 --> 02:13:44.649
HOLE.

02:13:44.716 --> 02:13:45.450
AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO START

02:13:45.517 --> 02:13:46.952
DIGGING THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU

02:13:47.018 --> 02:13:48.186
THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS

02:13:48.253 --> 02:13:49.588
KEEP DIGGING IS NOT REALLY

02:13:49.654 --> 02:13:50.255
COMPELLING ARGUMENT EVER GET OUT

02:13:50.322 --> 02:13:50.889
OF THE HOLE.

02:13:50.956 --> 02:13:52.224
I'M YOU HAVE A CERTAIN DAY EVEN

02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:53.125
ACCUMULATED THAT ALREADY

02:13:53.191 --> 02:13:54.960
HAPPENED YESTERDAY IS GONE AND

02:13:55.026 --> 02:13:55.961
AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE

02:13:56.027 --> 02:13:57.095
THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE

02:13:57.162 --> 02:13:57.696
REGARDLESS WHAT POLICY FROM

02:13:57.763 --> 02:13:58.363
TOMORROW.

02:13:58.430 --> 02:13:59.965
THE BECAUSE OF YOU ACTUALLY

02:14:00.031 --> 02:14:01.233
AGREED WITH THAT ARGUMENT THAT

02:14:01.299 --> 02:14:03.235
SOMEHOW THE CURRENT SYSTEM WOULD

02:14:03.301 --> 02:14:03.935
BE AFFECTED.

02:14:04.002 --> 02:14:06.438
IN ESSENCE YOU BE ACKNOWLEDGING

02:14:06.505 --> 02:14:07.038
THAT YOU'RE ENGAGED IN A PONZI

02:14:07.105 --> 02:14:08.440
SCHEME.

02:14:08.507 --> 02:14:09.174
THAT THE SOLVENCY IS ONLY

02:14:09.241 --> 02:14:10.876
OCCURRING BECAUSE OF GETTING

02:14:10.942 --> 02:14:12.444
MORE SUCKERS TO COME BACK INTO

02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:13.712
THE SYSTEM TO PAY FOR THE

02:14:13.779 --> 02:14:14.980
BENEFITS OF THAT YOU'VE ALREADY

02:14:15.046 --> 02:14:17.249
COMMITTED.

02:14:17.315 --> 02:14:19.751
TO YOU SAID IT YEAH SELF.

02:14:19.818 --> 02:14:21.820
I MEAN I I FIND THE THING SO

02:14:21.887 --> 02:14:23.555
INTERESTING BECAUSE HAVE A

02:14:23.622 --> 02:14:25.891
SITUATION WHERE UP WITH EVIDENCE

02:14:25.957 --> 02:14:27.659
IN AND OUR STATE AND IN OTHERS

02:14:27.726 --> 02:14:29.494
THAT THE EMPLOYEES BENEFIT THEY

02:14:29.561 --> 02:14:32.631
IT'S A DESIRABLE OPTION FOR THEM.

02:14:32.697 --> 02:14:33.665
AND AND AT SO THEY WOULD THEY

02:14:33.732 --> 02:14:35.333
WOULD LIKE IT IT'S IT'S A CHOICE

02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:36.401
AND FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW IT

02:14:36.468 --> 02:14:38.170
STOPS THAT WHOLE FROM GETTING

02:14:38.236 --> 02:14:38.904
ANY DEEPER.

02:14:38.970 --> 02:14:41.273
RIGHT AND ADDS AN OVERTIME WILL

02:14:41.339 --> 02:14:42.941
DETACH AS FROM THIS INCREDIBLY

02:14:43.008 --> 02:14:45.177
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WERE

02:14:45.243 --> 02:14:46.945
AND AGAIN OVER TIME -- AND YET

02:14:47.012 --> 02:14:48.380
THERE IS RESISTANCE.

02:14:48.447 --> 02:14:49.614
BECAUSE OF THIS FALSE CLAIM IS

02:14:49.681 --> 02:14:50.916
YOU HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

02:14:50.982 --> 02:14:52.684
SOMEHOW THE EXISTING RETIREMENT

02:14:52.751 --> 02:14:54.252
SYSTEM WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY.

02:14:54.319 --> 02:14:56.021
OF TAKING THAT STEP AND YET WE

02:14:56.087 --> 02:14:57.355
PREVENT ALL OF OUR SCHOOL

02:14:57.422 --> 02:14:59.024
DISTRICT FROM HAVING THAT CHOICE

02:14:59.090 --> 02:15:01.726
THAT CHOICE TO HAVE AN OPTION.

02:15:01.793 --> 02:15:04.229
IS NOT EVEN GIVEN TO THEM TODAY.

02:15:04.296 --> 02:15:07.532
I FIND IT -- YEAH WITH ITS PART

02:15:07.599 --> 02:15:09.134
NOW THEY THEY IF IT DID THEY

02:15:09.201 --> 02:15:10.836
CANNOT BARGAIN THIS OPTION IS

02:15:10.902 --> 02:15:12.137
THAT CORRECT.

02:15:12.204 --> 02:15:13.338
THEY COULD ADD MAYBE PROBABLY

02:15:13.405 --> 02:15:15.307
ADDED ONE ON THEMSELVES BUT THEY

02:15:15.373 --> 02:15:18.577
COULD NOT GIVE A CHOICE YOU HAVE

02:15:18.643 --> 02:15:19.578
TO BE AND CAL STAR IS IF YOU'RE

02:15:19.644 --> 02:15:20.212
A CERTIFIED.

02:15:20.278 --> 02:15:21.046
SOMETHING.

02:15:21.112 --> 02:15:24.182
AT SO I APPRECIATE THAT -- THE

02:15:24.249 --> 02:15:24.816
THAT IN SAY BY THE WAY.

02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:25.650
WE HEARD ABOUT THE LA EXAMPLE

02:15:25.717 --> 02:15:27.385
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HEARD

02:15:27.452 --> 02:15:29.521
THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS.

02:15:29.588 --> 02:15:31.456
HAVE GIVEN THE CONTROL -- OVER

02:15:31.523 --> 02:15:33.024
OTHER BENEFITS PROGRAM TO

02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:34.526
ANOTHER COMMITTEE.

02:15:34.593 --> 02:15:36.428
THAT SEEMS TO BE DOMINATED NOT

02:15:36.495 --> 02:15:37.796
BY THE ADMINISTRATION BUT BY THE

02:15:37.863 --> 02:15:39.464
PLOY GROUPS HAVE YOU HEARD OF

02:15:39.531 --> 02:15:41.366
THAT EXAMPLE IN PLACE ELSEWHERE

02:15:41.433 --> 02:15:43.502
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:15:43.568 --> 02:15:44.603
THAT MUST BE HEALTH NOT PENSIONS

02:15:44.669 --> 02:15:45.170
RIGHT.

02:15:45.237 --> 02:15:49.875

STUFF YOU HAVE A COULD I KNOW

02:15:51.142 --> 02:15:51.810
CAN BE WITH PENSIONS BECAUSE

02:15:51.877 --> 02:15:53.445
PENSION YOU KNOW THE DISTRICT

02:15:53.512 --> 02:15:55.280

TRULY CAN TREE BY THIS WHOLE

02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:01.820
ISSUE OF PRE FUNDING WHAT WHAT

02:16:01.887 --> 02:16:03.688
TIME BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM TO BE

02:16:03.755 --> 02:16:05.657
THE ANSWER RIGHT I MEAN YOU KNOW.

02:16:05.724 --> 02:16:07.058
CERTAINLY MOVING FOR I MEAN HERE

02:16:07.125 --> 02:16:07.526
I AM ON THE CHAIR THE

02:16:07.592 --> 02:16:08.159
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE

02:16:08.226 --> 02:16:09.661
PART WHAT WE DEAL WITH THE FACT

02:16:09.728 --> 02:16:11.463
THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAPPENING --

02:16:11.530 --> 02:16:12.564
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP

02:16:12.631 --> 02:16:16.801
IT AT LEAST NOT AS SOME OF IT

02:16:16.868 --> 02:16:17.869
AND YET WE GOT TO DEAL WITH WHAT

02:16:17.936 --> 02:16:19.971
WE CAN AND INCLUDING BOTH BE BE

THE SPEED WITH WHICH IT HITS US

02:16:24.209 --> 02:16:24.676
SO IT'S KIND OF THE SAME

02:16:24.743 --> 02:16:26.378
SITUATION IN.

02:16:26.444 --> 02:16:28.280

WHAT FIX MATT OUGHT TO BE

02:16:48.333 --> 02:16:49.935
LOOKING AT AT WHAT -- WHAT THE

02:16:50.001 --> 02:16:50.869
COUNTY OFFICES OUGHT TO BE

02:16:50.936 --> 02:16:52.337
LOOKING OUT WHEN THEY MAKE A

02:16:52.404 --> 02:16:53.838

PENSIONS THIS IS NOT REALLY A

02:17:17.228 --> 02:17:18.830
QUESTION THAT THE STATE SETS

02:17:18.897 --> 02:17:20.498
WITH THE DISTRICTS PAY TO THE

02:17:20.565 --> 02:17:21.433
PENSION PLAN.

THE ALL THE ADVANTAGES THAT I

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:53.965
MENTIONED OF PRE FUNDING ON THE

02:17:54.032 --> 02:17:54.599
OPEN SIDE I MEAN REALISTICALLY

02:17:54.666 --> 02:17:55.200
THERE ARE THE IT IS IT IS A

02:17:55.266 --> 02:17:56.101
SHORT TERM COST TO DISTRICTS TO

02:17:56.167 --> 02:17:57.135
BE PRE FUNDING AS THE EMPLOYEES

02:17:57.202 --> 02:17:58.503
ARE EARNING.

02:17:58.570 --> 02:17:59.671
THE BENEFITS AND I MEAN I THINK

02:17:59.738 --> 02:18:00.472
FOR THE REASON WE'RE HERE IS A

02:18:00.538 --> 02:18:02.007
DISTRICTS ARE FACING A LOT OF

02:18:02.073 --> 02:18:04.042
COMPETING PRESSURES -- JUSTICE

02:18:04.109 --> 02:18:05.076
PAYING INTO THE RAINY DAY FUND

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:06.578
IS A SHORT TERM COSTS BUT IT'S

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:07.879
GOING TO HELP US WIN.

02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:09.347
YES AND TO BE CLEAR THE THERE

02:18:09.414 --> 02:18:10.548
ARE INCLUDED ACCOUNTING

02:18:10.615 --> 02:18:11.716
STANDARDS FOR DISTRICT TWO

02:18:11.783 --> 02:18:13.018
INCREASINGLY REQUIRE THAT

02:18:13.084 --> 02:18:14.319
DISTRICTS ACCOUNT FOR THESE

02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:15.587
LIABILITIES FOR EXAMPLE AS

02:18:15.654 --> 02:18:16.588
EMPLOYEES ARE IN THEM RATHER

02:18:16.655 --> 02:18:17.722
THAN SORT OF NOT I CAN'T BRING

02:18:17.789 --> 02:18:18.790
THEM ON THE ON THE BOOKS UNTIL

02:18:18.857 --> 02:18:20.992
AFTER -- EMPLOYEES RETIRE BUT

02:18:21.059 --> 02:18:22.861
THEY DON'T REQUIRE PRE FUNDING I

02:18:22.927 --> 02:18:24.562
DO BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT --

02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:25.797
PARTICULARLY NOW THIS IS

02:18:25.864 --> 02:18:27.232
INCREASED WHERE DISTRICTS NEED

02:18:27.298 --> 02:18:28.700
TO BE GETTING REGULAR --

02:18:28.767 --> 02:18:30.035
ACTUARIAL REPORTS ON THEIR BED

02:18:30.101 --> 02:18:31.770
LIABILITIES I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

02:18:31.836 --> 02:18:33.605
HOW -- FIGMENT DEALS WITH THOSE

02:18:33.672 --> 02:18:34.606
BUT I MEAN I DO I DO BELIEVE

02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:37.008
THEY ARE CONSIDERED AS PART OF

02:18:37.075 --> 02:18:39.077
DISTRICTS -- SORT OF A IN THE

02:18:39.144 --> 02:18:39.711
ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER DISTRICTS

02:18:39.778 --> 02:18:40.378
WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR

02:18:40.445 --> 02:18:41.780
OBLIGATIONS GOING FORWARD I'M

02:18:41.846 --> 02:18:42.947
NOT SURE I THINK PART OF THE

02:18:43.014 --> 02:18:44.349
PROBLEM MIGHT BE THAT SOMETIMES

02:18:44.416 --> 02:18:45.984
THE WINDOWS THAT ARE USED TO

02:18:46.051 --> 02:18:47.419
ASSESS DISTRICT BUDGETS OFTEN

02:18:47.485 --> 02:18:53.058
HAVE NOT PROJECTED -- IT FAR

02:18:53.124 --> 02:18:53.992
ENOUGH TO SEE SOME OF THE WHEN

02:18:54.059 --> 02:18:55.193
THE PUBLIC ABILITIES WILL BE

02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:56.027
BECOMING DO AS THAT MIGHT BE A

02:18:56.094 --> 02:18:57.162
FACTOR THERE BUT I WOULD DEFER

02:18:57.228 --> 02:18:58.229
TO THE THE PEOPLE DOING THAT

02:18:58.296 --> 02:18:58.763
THOSE BECAUSE THAT KIND OF

02:18:58.830 --> 02:18:59.064
MONITORING.

02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:00.365
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY EXAMPLES OF

02:19:00.432 --> 02:19:01.866
OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE'S WHERE

02:19:01.933 --> 02:19:03.935
WHERE STATE SAY DISTRICTS YOU

02:19:04.002 --> 02:19:05.136
KNOW HEY LOOK YOU'RE TôI

02:19:05.203 --> 02:19:05.770
WELCOME TO BARGAIN WHICH ONE A

02:19:05.837 --> 02:19:06.438
BARGAIN.

02:19:06.504 --> 02:19:08.840
THAT'S YOUR RIGHT BUT YOU HAVE

02:19:08.907 --> 02:19:09.674
TO THEN BUILD.

02:19:09.741 --> 02:19:11.409
THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR

02:19:11.476 --> 02:19:12.043
YOU KNOW YOUR BARGAINING IN NOT

02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:13.378
JUST.

02:19:13.445 --> 02:19:15.146
YOU DID YOUR CURRENT BUDGET NOT

02:19:15.213 --> 02:19:17.749
JUST -- ALLOW.

02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:18.750
THAT TO BE ON THE BOOKS FOR WAY

02:19:18.817 --> 02:19:20.285
OFF IN THE FUTURE I'M NOT OFF

02:19:20.351 --> 02:19:21.753
HAND BUT I CAN I CAN LOOK AND

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:22.687
SEE IF STATES OTHER STATES HAVE

02:19:22.754 --> 02:19:24.489
DONE THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT

02:19:24.556 --> 02:19:25.824
IT BUT IT'S IT'S A POSSIBILITY

02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:26.024
YEAH.

02:19:26.091 --> 02:19:27.092
BECAUSE WASN'T GROUPS REALLY ONE

02:19:27.158 --> 02:19:29.227
OF THE CHALLENGES IS YOU KNOW

02:19:29.294 --> 02:19:29.828
THIS IS A SCHOOL WHERE MEMBERS

02:19:29.894 --> 02:19:30.729
IT.

02:19:30.795 --> 02:19:31.730
THESE ARE COMMITMENTS THAT ARE

02:19:31.796 --> 02:19:32.263
MADE THAT THAT THE CURRENT

02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:34.733
PORTAL NEVER REALLY HAVE.

02:19:34.799 --> 02:19:36.301
TO DEAL WITH -- ANY ANY AND THE

02:19:36.367 --> 02:19:37.802
REAL COST IN AND BY THE WAY THIS

02:19:37.869 --> 02:19:39.537
IS IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

02:19:39.604 --> 02:19:41.372
THE BOARD NECESSARILY OUGHT NOT

02:19:41.439 --> 02:19:42.140
TO DO.

02:19:42.207 --> 02:19:43.875
I'M IF THAT'S THE PRIORITY THAT

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:45.076
THE COMMUNITY THE BOARD AND AND

02:19:45.143 --> 02:19:45.910
THEN AND THE NEEDS OF THEIR

02:19:45.977 --> 02:19:47.078
EMPLOYEES THAT THAT'S THAT'S

02:19:47.145 --> 02:19:48.613
FINE BUT BUT IT OUGHT TO BE.

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:49.948
BUILT INTO THEIR FINANCIAL MODEL

02:19:50.014 --> 02:19:51.116
IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY

02:19:51.182 --> 02:19:55.920

DON'T HAVE TO ADDRESS IT RIGHT

02:26:28.746 --> 02:26:30.781
NOW THE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ABOUT

02:26:30.848 --> 02:26:32.483

IN SOME WAY.

02:27:08.252 --> 02:27:09.687

THE SYSTEM WAS PROJECTED TO RUN

02:28:04.442 --> 02:28:06.377
OUT OF FUNDING BY THE MID TWENTY

ISSUE IT HAD MANY MANY HEARINGS

02:28:12.316 --> 02:28:13.517
IT WAS OF A VERY.

02:28:13.584 --> 02:28:15.553
COMPLETE THOROUGH STUDY THAT WAS

02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:16.887
DONE MCALLISTER IS.

02:28:16.954 --> 02:28:18.289
AND THE LEGISLATURE EVENTUALLY

02:28:18.356 --> 02:28:20.891
CRAFTED A PLAN AT WORK WORKING

02:28:20.958 --> 02:28:22.360
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT

02:28:22.426 --> 02:28:22.860

AND HELP DISTRICTS WITH THE

02:28:27.698 --> 02:28:30.268
LOCAL BUDGETING -- THAT PLAN I

02:28:30.334 --> 02:28:31.836
GAVE DISTRICTS A SEVEN YEAR

02:28:31.902 --> 02:28:33.738
STATUTORY SCHEDULE SO THAT THEY

02:28:33.804 --> 02:28:35.406
WOULD KNOW IN.

02:28:35.473 --> 02:28:35.906
TWENTY FOURTEEN WHAT THE

02:28:35.973 --> 02:28:40.077
CONTRIBUTION RATE WOULD BE EVERY

02:28:40.144 --> 02:28:41.879
YEAR THROUGH.

TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND

02:28:42.513 --> 02:28:42.980
PLAN ALSO FACED IN HIGHER

02:28:43.047 --> 02:28:44.482
CONTRIBUTIONS FOR TEACHERS AS

WELL AS THE STATE -- GENERAL

02:28:45.516 --> 02:28:47.051
FUND.

02:28:47.118 --> 02:28:49.020
THE FIGURE ON PAGE TWO I THINK

02:28:49.086 --> 02:28:50.421
GIVES YOU A SENSE OF HOW

02:28:50.488 --> 02:28:52.256
SIGNIFICANT THAT PLAN WAS IN

02:28:52.323 --> 02:28:53.758
MOVING CAL STIRS MUCH DIRECTORY

02:28:53.824 --> 02:28:58.296
WHERE IT WAS -- ON TRACK TO ONE

02:28:58.362 --> 02:29:01.098
OF THE FUNDING MY ON TRACK TO

02:29:01.165 --> 02:29:03.034
REACH A FULL FUNDING -- OVER

02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:05.303
THAT SAME PERIOD.

02:29:05.369 --> 02:29:06.837
BUT AS YOU HEARD AND TURNING TO

02:29:06.904 --> 02:29:08.406
PAGE.

02:29:08.472 --> 02:29:09.507
THREE THIS IS A THIRTY TWO YEAR

02:29:09.573 --> 02:29:09.874
PLAN.

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:11.242
AND SO -- PERHAPS NOT

02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:12.510
SURPRISINGLY THE UNFUNDED

02:29:12.576 --> 02:29:14.045
LIABILITY TODAY IS STILL QUITE

02:29:14.111 --> 02:29:15.579
LARGE OVER A HUNDRD BILLION

02:29:15.646 --> 02:29:16.914
DOLLARS.

02:29:16.981 --> 02:29:18.349
OF THAT AMOUNT.

02:29:18.416 --> 02:29:20.618
ABOUT SEVENTY ONE BILLION IS

02:29:20.685 --> 02:29:22.820
ASSIGNED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:29:22.887 --> 02:29:23.454
THIRTY FIVE BILLION IS ASSIGNED

02:29:23.521 --> 02:29:25.122
TO THE STATE THOSE PERCENTAGES

02:29:25.189 --> 02:29:26.390
AREN'T FIXED THE LIABILITY KIND

02:29:26.457 --> 02:29:27.625
OF SHIFTS BETWEEN STATE AND

02:29:27.692 --> 02:29:28.726
DISTRICTS.

02:29:28.793 --> 02:29:31.228
EACH YEAR WITH UPDATED SORT OF

02:29:31.295 --> 02:29:33.097
ACTUAL NUMBERS AND INVESTMENT

02:29:33.164 --> 02:29:35.199
RETURNS AND OTHER FACTORS -- BUT

02:29:35.266 --> 02:29:36.334
STILL LARGE -- WHETHER YOU'RE

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:37.935
LOOKING AT JUST THE DISTRICTS

02:29:38.002 --> 02:29:40.204
HERE ORDER -- THIS YEAR FOR THE

02:29:40.271 --> 02:29:41.305
WHOLE SYSTEM.

02:29:41.372 --> 02:29:45.042
AND THEN THE UNASSIGNED SURE OF

02:29:45.109 --> 02:29:47.078
FIVE AND TWENTY THREE MILLION.

02:29:47.144 --> 02:29:47.945
THE GUY SAID IT WAS TWO HUNDRED

02:29:48.012 --> 02:29:48.579
MILLION IT'S ACTUALLY FIVE AND

02:29:48.646 --> 02:29:49.780
TWENTY THREE MILLION I THINK THE

02:29:49.847 --> 02:29:50.715
DIFFERENCE MIGHT BE AND HOW THE

02:29:50.781 --> 02:29:53.551
ASSETS ARE SORT OF BEING VALUED

02:29:53.617 --> 02:29:55.319
WITHIN CAL STIRS I CAN.

02:29:55.386 --> 02:29:56.620
SURE CHARACTERS CAN GIVE YOU

02:29:56.687 --> 02:29:57.254
MORE DETAIL ON THAT BUT YOU'RE

02:29:57.321 --> 02:29:57.822
RIGHT THAT IT'S RELATIVELY

02:29:57.888 --> 02:29:59.223
MODEST NOW BUT IT WILL KEEP

02:29:59.290 --> 02:29:59.790
GOING I THINK OVER THE NEXT

02:29:59.857 --> 02:30:01.559
COUPLE YEARS.

02:30:01.625 --> 02:30:02.893
THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE YU A

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:03.894
GOOD OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S

02:30:03.961 --> 02:30:04.662
HAPPENING WITH RATES AND

02:30:04.729 --> 02:30:06.097
CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER THEIR

02:30:06.163 --> 02:30:11.235
PROPOSAL.

02:30:11.302 --> 02:30:12.470
ALL DISTRICTS FACE THE SAME

02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:14.505
CONTRIBUTION RATE THERE ARE SOME

02:30:14.572 --> 02:30:16.640
DIFFERENCES IN THE COST

02:30:16.707 --> 02:30:17.842
INCREASES THE FEES.

02:30:17.908 --> 02:30:19.143
BASED ON THE DECISIONS THEY'RE

02:30:19.210 --> 02:30:21.245
MAKING ABOUT -- THINGS THAT

02:30:21.312 --> 02:30:22.980
AFFECT PAY WELL MAINLY TEACHER

02:30:23.047 --> 02:30:24.415
SALARY IN CLASS SIZE.

02:30:24.482 --> 02:30:25.349
A SOME DISTRICTS THAT HAVE

02:30:25.416 --> 02:30:26.484
INCREASED THOSE THINGS MORE

02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:28.152
RAPIDLY OVER THE YEARS AND OTHER

02:30:28.219 --> 02:30:29.920
DISTRICTS ARE ALSO FACING

02:30:29.987 --> 02:30:32.156
CORRESPONDINGLY HIGHER INCREASES

02:30:32.223 --> 02:30:34.725
IN THEIR HOUSES CONTRIBUTION

02:30:34.792 --> 02:30:37.294
COSTS.

02:30:37.361 --> 02:30:38.329
THE ADMINISTRATION ARE TRYING TO

02:30:38.396 --> 02:30:39.764
PAGE FIVE GIVE YOU A GOOD

02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:41.832
OVERVIEW OF THEIR PROPOSALS. ONE

02:30:41.899 --> 02:30:43.834
POINTED EMPHASIZES THAT ALTHOUGH

02:30:43.901 --> 02:30:45.403
THE PROPOSALS ARE SORT OF BOTH

02:30:45.469 --> 02:30:46.404
INVOLVING HEALTHCARE IS THERE

02:30:46.470 --> 02:30:48.038
REALLY A QUITE DIFFERENT IN

02:30:48.105 --> 02:30:48.906
THEIR OBJECTIVES.

02:30:48.973 --> 02:30:50.541
ARE THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION IS

02:30:50.608 --> 02:30:52.777
REALLY A PROPOSAL THAT'S ALL

02:30:52.843 --> 02:30:54.545
ABOUT BUDGET RELIEF BY DESIGN

02:30:54.612 --> 02:30:56.480
IT'S NOT INTENDED TO SORT OF

02:30:56.547 --> 02:30:58.215
IMPROVE OR WORSEN CAL STIRS

02:30:58.282 --> 02:30:58.749
CURRENT.

02:30:58.816 --> 02:31:00.518
FUNDING SITUATION IT'S REALLY

02:31:00.584 --> 02:31:01.685
ABOUT PROVIDING RELIEF FOR

02:31:01.752 --> 02:31:05.189
DISTRICTS IN THE IN THE NEAR

02:31:05.256 --> 02:31:06.757
TERM OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

02:31:06.824 --> 02:31:07.758
OF THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION

02:31:07.825 --> 02:31:08.959
IS SORT OF JUST THE REVERSE IT'S

02:31:09.026 --> 02:31:09.860
MAINLY A PROPOSAL ABOUT PAYING

02:31:09.927 --> 02:31:11.595
DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY AND

02:31:11.662 --> 02:31:12.530
THERE ARE SOME LONG TERM

02:31:12.596 --> 02:31:14.298
BENEFITS FOR DISTRICTS FOR THAT

02:31:14.365 --> 02:31:15.466
BUT THEY REALLY ARE IN THE LONG

02:31:15.533 --> 02:31:17.201
TERM THEY WON'T BE.

02:31:17.268 --> 02:31:18.736
A SORT OF ANY IMMEDIATE SAVINGS

02:31:18.803 --> 02:31:20.004
FOR DISTRICTS THE NEXT TWO YEARS

02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:21.972
BUT THERE COULD BE -- MORE

02:31:22.039 --> 02:31:24.575
MODEST SAVINGS OVER A MUCH

02:31:24.642 --> 02:31:27.111
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.

02:31:27.178 --> 02:31:28.412
I TURNING TO OUR ASSESSMENT AND

02:31:28.479 --> 02:31:30.648
HE'S SIX I THINK THE REASON THAT%

02:31:30.714 --> 02:31:31.816
CAL STIRS HAS.

02:31:31.882 --> 02:31:33.017
ACOSTA BEEN SUCH A DIFFICULT

02:31:33.083 --> 02:31:34.251
CONVERSATION IS THAT THE

02:31:34.318 --> 02:31:36.587
DISTRICT CONTRIBUTION RATE TODAY.

02:31:36.654 --> 02:31:39.490
ALREADY AROUND 16%.

02:31:39.557 --> 02:31:41.392
MORE THAN DOUBLE ITS LEVEL FROM

02:31:41.459 --> 02:31:42.860
FIVE YEARS AGO.

02:31:42.927 --> 02:31:45.029
AND DESPITE THAT INCREASE THE

02:31:45.095 --> 02:31:46.297
RATE STILL ISN'T AT THE LEVEL.

02:31:46.363 --> 02:31:48.566
WHERE IT'S NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE

02:31:48.632 --> 02:31:50.000
OBJECTIVES OF HE FUNDING PLAN?

02:31:50.067 --> 02:31:51.502
AND SO THE QUESTION I THINK THE

02:31:51.569 --> 02:31:53.070
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PUTS BEFORE

02:31:53.137 --> 02:31:53.804
YOU.

02:31:53.871 --> 02:31:57.007
ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT WHETHER TO

02:31:57.074 --> 02:31:58.776
INCREASE DISTRICT RATES BUT WHAT

02:31:58.843 --> 02:31:59.944
THE TIMING SHOULD BE AND WHEN

02:32:00.010 --> 02:32:00.511
THOSE RATE INCREASES SHOULD

02:32:00.578 --> 02:32:01.245
OCCUR.

02:32:01.312 --> 02:32:02.813
AT DISTRICTS ARE LIKELY TO SEE

02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:03.981
INCREASES IN RATES IS

02:32:04.048 --> 02:32:05.416
CHALLENGING IN ANY FISCAL

02:32:05.483 --> 02:32:06.951
ENVIRONMENT.

02:32:07.017 --> 02:32:07.685
BUT AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE

02:32:07.751 --> 02:32:09.820
QUESTION THE STATE RIGHT NOW IS

02:32:09.887 --> 02:32:11.255
IN THE MIDST OF VERY STRONG

02:32:11.322 --> 02:32:12.923
ECONOMIC TIMES.

02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:13.991
A SCHOOL FUNDING AS YOU HEARD

02:32:14.058 --> 02:32:15.693
HAS GONE TWENTY TWO BILLION OVER

02:32:15.759 --> 02:32:17.161
THE PAST SIX YEARS ANOTHER TWO

02:32:17.228 --> 02:32:19.463
POINT NINE BILLION IN THE

02:32:19.530 --> 02:32:21.532
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- SCHOOL

02:32:21.599 --> 02:32:23.167
FUNDING ON A PER PUPIL BASIS IS

02:32:23.234 --> 02:32:24.935
AT AN ALL TIME HIGH AND SO THE

02:32:25.002 --> 02:32:26.570
ALTERNATIVE WE WANT TO SKETCH

02:32:26.637 --> 02:32:28.072
OUT FOR YOU.

02:32:28.138 --> 02:32:30.174
IS TO SATISFY THE SEVEN HUNDRED

02:32:30.241 --> 02:32:31.442
MILLION AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES

02:32:31.509 --> 02:32:34.044
BUT NOT USE IT TOO IMMEDIATELY I

02:32:34.111 --> 02:32:35.045
JUST DISTRICT.

02:32:35.112 --> 02:32:36.180
THREE INSTEAD LEAVE THE CURRENT

02:32:36.247 --> 02:32:37.882
RATES ON THEIR STATUTORY

02:32:37.948 --> 02:32:38.883
SCHEDULE.

02:32:38.949 --> 02:32:42.987
AND THAT INSTEAD USE THEM OUT.

02:32:43.053 --> 02:32:43.954
DURING THE NEXT DOWNTURN IN

02:32:44.021 --> 02:32:45.055
DISTRICTS MIGHT BE FACING

02:32:45.122 --> 02:32:46.524
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT BUDGET

02:32:46.590 --> 02:32:47.925
CHOICES MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IN

02:32:47.992 --> 02:32:49.026
THE ARE TODAY.

02:32:49.093 --> 02:32:50.594
AND USE THAT SEVEN HUNDRED

02:32:50.661 --> 02:32:52.329
MILLION TO PROVIDE GREAT RELIEF

02:32:52.396 --> 02:32:55.666
AT THAT POINT.

02:32:55.733 --> 02:32:57.334
TURNING TO ACQUIRE THE FINAL

02:32:57.401 --> 02:33:00.037
PAGE PAGE -- SEVEN AND YOU PUT A

02:33:00.104 --> 02:33:01.138
LOT OF ALREADY ABOUT THE

02:33:01.205 --> 02:33:02.306
GOVERNOR'S PLANS FOR DEBTS AND

02:33:02.373 --> 02:33:03.707
LIABILITIES HIS CHARACTERS

02:33:03.774 --> 02:33:05.242
PROPOSAL IS JUST ONE OF MANY

02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:06.343
PROPOSALS YOU'VE HEARD YOU HAD A

02:33:06.410 --> 02:33:08.312
WHOLE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE

02:33:08.379 --> 02:33:09.747
HEARING ON THOSE TOPICS.

02:33:09.813 --> 02:33:11.382
I'M A COUPLE WEEKS AGO SO I

02:33:11.448 --> 02:33:12.149
WON'T FOR THE BELIEVER

02:33:12.216 --> 02:33:13.584
ASSESSMENT.

02:33:13.651 --> 02:33:15.486
BUT INBRIEF WE THINK THE STATE

02:33:15.553 --> 02:33:16.620
DOES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY NOW

02:33:16.687 --> 02:33:18.389
WITH SUCH A LARGE A BUDGET

02:33:18.455 --> 02:33:19.323
SURPLUS.

02:33:19.390 --> 02:33:20.891
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT

02:33:20.958 --> 02:33:22.893
OPPORTUNITY TO PAY OWN SOME

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:24.194
LIABILITIES SEEMS PRUDENT THERE

02:33:24.261 --> 02:33:27.064
ARE POTENTIALLY.

02:33:27.131 --> 02:33:28.365
SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM SAVINGS.

02:33:28.432 --> 02:33:29.500
YOUR ACTIONS ON THE TWO POINT

02:33:29.567 --> 02:33:30.401
THREE BILLION I THINK ARE LIKELY

02:33:30.467 --> 02:33:32.269
TO DEPEND ON HOW WILLING YOU ARE

02:33:32.336 --> 02:33:33.370
TO ASSUME.

02:33:33.437 --> 02:33:35.272
SOME ADDITIONAL SHARE OF

02:33:35.339 --> 02:33:36.640
DISTRICT LIABILITIES.

02:33:36.707 --> 02:33:38.609
AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE ALSO

02:33:38.676 --> 02:33:39.777
HAS MANY OTHER LIABILITIES

02:33:39.843 --> 02:33:41.412
INCLUDING LIABILITIES FOR ITS

02:33:41.478 --> 02:33:43.847
OWN EMPLOYEES AND PENSION COSTS

02:33:43.914 --> 02:33:45.816
THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT -- AND

02:33:45.883 --> 02:33:47.184
SO IT SORT OF COMES DOWN TO YOUR

02:33:47.251 --> 02:33:49.420
DECISION ABOUT ARE YOU WILLING.

02:33:49.486 --> 02:33:50.054
TO TAKE ON A LITTLE BIT MORE OF

02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:52.423
THE THE SHARE OF THE UNFUNDED

02:33:52.489 --> 02:33:53.824
LIABILITY THAN WAS ORIGINALLY

02:33:53.891 --> 02:33:56.160
ASSIGNED TO THE STATE.

02:33:56.226 --> 02:33:58.062
UNDER THE TWENTY FOURTEEN PLAN.

02:33:58.128 --> 02:33:59.630
A SO WITH THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY

02:33:59.697 --> 02:34:00.998
TO TAKEANY QUESTIONS IS IT

02:34:01.065 --> 02:34:02.199
POSSIBLE THAT THE DISTRICTS

02:34:02.266 --> 02:34:03.734
DISTRICTS OF ALREADY BUDGETED

02:34:03.801 --> 02:34:05.035
FOR THE RATE BY DOWN WHICH WOULD

02:34:05.102 --> 02:34:06.270
CAUSE.

02:34:06.337 --> 02:34:07.538
CHANGE AT THIS POINT WHICH MIGHT

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:11.141
CAUSE PROBLEMS.

02:34:11.208 --> 02:34:12.910
IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE I THINK

02:34:12.977 --> 02:34:14.411
WE'D BE CONCERNED THAT THAT'S NO

02:34:14.478 --> 02:34:15.846
THAT'S NOT GOOD FISCAL PRACTICE

02:34:15.913 --> 02:34:17.181
TO BECOME SOMETHING FOR IT EVEN

02:34:17.247 --> 02:34:19.917
HAPPENS -- I THINK IN THE PAST

02:34:19.984 --> 02:34:22.052
DISTRICTS -- SOMETIMES THERE'S A

02:34:22.119 --> 02:34:23.721
PERCEPTION OF THE JANUARY BUDGET

02:34:23.787 --> 02:34:24.888
IS JUST KIND OF THE OPENING

02:34:24.955 --> 02:34:26.824
LEVEL AND THERE ARE CERTAIN

02:34:26.890 --> 02:34:28.359
THINGS WILL BE BETTER BY ME BUT

02:34:28.425 --> 02:34:29.259
YOU KNOW THAT.

02:34:29.326 --> 02:34:30.160
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE

02:34:30.227 --> 02:34:31.662
THIS YEAR KIND OF LOOKING AT TAX

02:34:31.729 --> 02:34:33.364
RETURNS IN SOME OF THE OTHER

02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:34.965
ECONOMIC INDICATORS MAKE COULD

02:34:35.032 --> 02:34:36.800
BE A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER.

02:34:36.867 --> 02:34:38.268
AND SO I THINK.

02:34:38.335 --> 02:34:39.470
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEND THE SIX

02:34:39.536 --> 02:34:41.105
SIX SIGNAL NOW OF OF CAUTION FOR

02:34:41.171 --> 02:34:42.006
DISTRICTS ABOUT BANKING

02:34:42.072 --> 02:34:45.275
EVERYTHING THAT'S NECESSARILY IN

02:34:45.342 --> 02:34:47.378
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RIGHT NOW

02:34:47.444 --> 02:34:47.678
[inaudible]

02:34:47.745 --> 02:34:48.712
CULTURES.

02:34:48.779 --> 02:34:51.048
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

02:34:51.115 --> 02:34:53.017
BOTH THE GERMAN HAVE -- GONE

02:34:53.083 --> 02:34:55.052
OVER THE THE PROPOSAL'S VERY

02:34:55.119 --> 02:34:56.987
WELL THEY'VE DONE A VERY GOOD

02:34:57.054 --> 02:34:58.922
JOB SO I WON'T REPEAT.

02:34:58.989 --> 02:35:00.591
THINGS THAT HAVE SAID BUT WHEN

02:35:00.658 --> 02:35:02.059
WE LOOKING AT THE SIX BILLION

02:35:02.126 --> 02:35:03.694
DOLLARS IN TOTAL.

02:35:03.761 --> 02:35:05.629
THAT IS PROPOSED TO THE

02:35:05.696 --> 02:35:07.564
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TO TO BE

02:35:07.631 --> 02:35:09.700
CONTRIBUTED TO CHARACTERS.

02:35:09.767 --> 02:35:11.068
AND WE LOOK AT THE EFFECT ON THE

02:35:11.135 --> 02:35:12.403
UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:14.705
IT'S A VERY GOOD PROPOSAL AND

02:35:14.772 --> 02:35:16.340
WILL PAY DOWN.

02:35:16.407 --> 02:35:18.909
DEBT OVER THE LONG TERM.

02:35:18.976 --> 02:35:20.978
IN OVER THE LONG TERM THIS WOULD

02:35:21.045 --> 02:35:22.713
BE A TREMENDOUS SAVINGS TO THE

02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:25.115
STATE BECAUSE WE GET MONEY WE

02:35:25.182 --> 02:35:26.784
WERE ABLE TO INVESTED.

02:35:26.850 --> 02:35:29.653
AT LOW RIGHT NOW OUR ASSUMPTION

02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:30.988
IS 7%.

02:35:31.055 --> 02:35:32.890
BUT IN IN SOME CASES WE MAY BE

02:35:32.956 --> 02:35:35.659
MORE OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS

02:35:35.726 --> 02:35:36.460
CAL STARTED.

02:35:36.527 --> 02:35:38.896
RATE OF RETURN IS AVERAGE EIGHT

02:35:38.962 --> 02:35:39.697
POINT 6%.

02:35:39.763 --> 02:35:41.432
SO WHEN WE HAVE THE MONEY YOU

02:35:41.498 --> 02:35:42.366
CAN INVEST IT.

02:35:42.433 --> 02:35:44.968
IN THE SAVINGS DOWN THE LINE.

02:35:45.035 --> 02:35:47.638
CONTINUES TO GROW AND CONTINUE

02:35:47.705 --> 02:35:50.307
TO GROW MULTIPLY SO.

02:35:50.374 --> 02:35:52.009
THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK.

02:35:52.076 --> 02:35:52.476
AND OTHERS LIKE IT.

02:35:52.543 --> 02:35:54.378
ARE EXCELLENT IDEAS TO TRY TO

02:35:54.445 --> 02:35:55.946
STRENGTHEN THE FUNDING PLAN

02:35:56.013 --> 02:35:58.015
WHICH IS WORKING.

02:35:58.082 --> 02:36:00.384
IS WORKING SO OUR MENU SO FAR

02:36:00.451 --> 02:36:01.552
IT'S WORKING.

02:36:01.618 --> 02:36:02.953
IT'S FIVE YEARS THE THE THE

02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:05.889
PROPOSAL'SPASSED IN TWO

02:36:05.956 --> 02:36:06.657
THOUSAND FOURTEEN BUT IT DIDN'T

02:36:06.724 --> 02:36:08.959
START TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN

02:36:09.026 --> 02:36:11.061
EFFECT SO IN EFFECT IT'S BEEN IN

02:36:11.128 --> 02:36:13.097
EFFECT.

02:36:13.163 --> 02:36:13.831
WHERE CONTRIBUTIONS OF JUMPED

02:36:13.897 --> 02:36:14.998
FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND SO

02:36:15.065 --> 02:36:15.833
FAR?

02:36:15.899 --> 02:36:18.035
IS WORKING VERY WELL SO WE

02:36:18.102 --> 02:36:19.470
SUPPORT.

02:36:19.536 --> 02:36:21.105
OPPOSED TO STRENGTHEN.

02:36:21.171 --> 02:36:23.607
THE THE FUNDING PLAN AND THIS IS

02:36:23.674 --> 02:36:25.109
ONE OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT WOULD DO

02:36:25.175 --> 02:36:27.945
SO AND SO WITH THAT I'M JUST.

02:36:28.011 --> 02:36:29.580
AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS WELL

02:36:29.646 --> 02:36:31.048
LET ME AS MY GENERAL QUESTION

02:36:31.115 --> 02:36:33.283
THAT I SORT OF ALLUDED TO AT THE

02:36:33.350 --> 02:36:34.218
BEGINNING WHAT WE DO ABOUT THE

02:36:34.284 --> 02:36:36.286
UNASSIGNEDUNFUNDED LIABILITY

02:36:36.353 --> 02:36:39.256
FOR THE BENEFITS OF THAT --

02:36:39.323 --> 02:36:40.958
EARNED WERE UNDER CRUDE AFTER TO

02:36:41.024 --> 02:36:43.227
THE TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY

02:36:43.293 --> 02:36:45.462
FOURTEEN YEAR SO SO RIGHT NOW IT.

02:36:45.529 --> 02:36:47.865
IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE INVESTOR

02:36:47.931 --> 02:36:51.235
RETURNS IN THE FUND IF THERE'S

02:36:51.301 --> 02:36:52.302
ENOUGH ACCESS.

02:36:52.369 --> 02:36:52.903
FROM THE INVESTMENT TURNS TO

02:36:52.970 --> 02:36:54.972
MAKE UP FOR THIS.

02:36:55.038 --> 02:36:55.873
SO.

02:36:55.939 --> 02:36:56.607
I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE

02:36:56.673 --> 02:36:57.941
DOING WILL KEEP AN EYE ON IT.

02:36:58.008 --> 02:36:59.143
BECAUSE IT HASN'T GROWN VERY

02:36:59.209 --> 02:37:00.978
LARGE NOW BUT IT WILL CONTINUE

02:37:01.044 --> 02:37:01.945
TO GROW.

02:37:02.012 --> 02:37:04.681
UNLESS A SOLUTION IT IS MADE ARE

02:37:04.748 --> 02:37:06.583
THAT THEIR ACCESS INVEST RETURNS

02:37:06.650 --> 02:37:08.585
TO COVER SO I MEAN I GUESS MY

02:37:08.652 --> 02:37:10.754
THOUGHT AND MY QUESTION IS MAYBE

02:37:10.821 --> 02:37:11.555
TO FINANCE.

02:37:11.622 --> 02:37:13.390
IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE A YEAR

02:37:13.457 --> 02:37:14.958
THAT'S A GOOD YEAR WHO KNOWS IF

02:37:15.025 --> 02:37:15.592
WE FIND THAT.

02:37:15.659 --> 02:37:17.394
THE MISSING TWO POINT TWO

02:37:17.461 --> 02:37:18.829
BILLION OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER

02:37:18.896 --> 02:37:20.397
IS HAPPENS TO SHOW UP IN THE

02:37:20.464 --> 02:37:23.100
MAILBOX SOMEWHERE -- WHY

02:37:23.167 --> 02:37:25.169
WOULDN'T WE TAKE TWO HUNDRED

02:37:25.235 --> 02:37:25.803
MILLION AND JUST BY DOWN THE

02:37:25.869 --> 02:37:28.272
UNFUNDED LIABILITY BE DONE WITH

02:37:28.338 --> 02:37:30.073
IT AS OPPOSED TO LETTING IT GROW?

02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:32.576
IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION.

02:37:32.643 --> 02:37:34.378
ON ON UNFORTUNATELY MISTER CHAIR

02:37:34.444 --> 02:37:36.947
I PERSONALLY -- AM NOT -- I

02:37:37.014 --> 02:37:38.916
THINK WELL VERSED ENOUGH IN THIS

02:37:38.982 --> 02:37:39.516
PARTICULAR ISSUE AT ALL AFTER

02:37:39.583 --> 02:37:40.884
OVER TO OUR EMPLOYEE

02:37:40.951 --> 02:37:41.985
COMPENSATION FROM.

02:37:42.052 --> 02:37:45.088
WELL AS COASTERS OKAY SO

02:37:45.155 --> 02:37:46.123
ALTHOUGH I DON'T CONTROL THE

02:37:46.190 --> 02:37:47.658
STATE BUDGET SO WHAT WE IF WE

02:37:47.724 --> 02:37:48.458
TAKE TO AN EIGHT MILLION IT

02:37:48.525 --> 02:37:50.294
WOULD REDUCE THAT AND WE COULD

02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:52.529
ALLOCATE YOU CAN ALLOCATE THAT.

02:37:52.596 --> 02:37:56.166
TO TO THAT PIECE AND THEN ON THE

02:37:56.233 --> 02:37:56.767
BOOKS WE WOULD SHOW THERE'S NO

02:37:56.834 --> 02:37:57.701
MORE.

02:37:57.768 --> 02:37:59.670
UNFUNDED FOR THAT PIECE.

02:37:59.736 --> 02:38:00.470
THE ONE THING WE ALWAYS HAVE TO

02:38:00.537 --> 02:38:01.104
KEEP IN MIND IS THE ASSETS WE

02:38:01.171 --> 02:38:02.606
HAVE ARE AT RISK.

02:38:02.673 --> 02:38:04.041
IN THE EQUITY MARKET SO WE MAY

02:38:04.107 --> 02:38:05.209
SEE IT AGAIN.

02:38:05.275 --> 02:38:06.643
SO YOU MAY SEE AGAIN OR YOU MAY

02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:08.345
SEE SURPLUSES SO WHAT HAPPENED

02:38:08.412 --> 02:38:10.547
IN -- LATE NIGHT -- NINETEEN

02:38:10.614 --> 02:38:12.382
NINETIES TWO THOUSAND THEY WERE

02:38:12.449 --> 02:38:13.617
JUST TREMENDOUS SURPLUSES

02:38:13.684 --> 02:38:16.920
BECAUSE OF INVEST RETURNS AND SO

02:38:16.987 --> 02:38:19.489
THAT'S ALSO A POSSIBILITY SO IT

02:38:19.556 --> 02:38:21.658
CAN GO EITHER WAY.

02:38:21.725 --> 02:38:24.261
I GUESS YEAH.

02:38:24.328 --> 02:38:26.663
THE GREATER ANY QUESTIONS

02:38:26.730 --> 02:38:26.964
[inaudible]

02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:28.232
EXCELLENT PRESENTATION.

THANK YOU GERMAN.

02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:31.335
WITH THIS IS AN OPEN ITEM

02:38:31.401 --> 02:38:32.603
BECAUSE IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE

02:38:32.669 --> 02:38:33.871

IMPACT ON THE STATE AND THE

02:56:44.827 --> 02:56:45.995
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF THAT

02:56:46.062 --> 02:56:48.097
WERE TO HAPPEN.

02:56:48.164 --> 02:56:49.398
TECHNICALLY I'M NOT WE'RE NOT

02:56:49.465 --> 02:56:51.767
MAN FOR THAT EVEN AT OUR CURRENT%

02:56:51.834 --> 02:56:53.502
LEVELS AND EVEN AT TEN

02:56:53.569 --> 02:56:55.137
ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WE WERE NOT

02:56:55.204 --> 02:56:56.238
MEANT FOR THAT WHAT WOULD YOU

02:56:56.305 --> 02:56:58.040
HAVE ANY IDEA OR ANY PROJECTIONS

02:56:58.107 --> 02:56:59.108
AS TO WHAT.

02:56:59.175 --> 02:57:00.943
ADDITIONAL F. T. EASE YOU WOULD

02:57:01.010 --> 02:57:02.945
NEED IN ORDER FIVE BILLION IT'S

02:57:03.012 --> 02:57:05.281
IT'S IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN

02:57:05.348 --> 02:57:06.816
IMAGINE BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU HAVE

02:57:06.882 --> 02:57:08.384
STAFF THAT FOR THAT FIVE BILLION

02:57:08.451 --> 02:57:09.819
DOLLAR WORKLOAD.

02:57:09.885 --> 02:57:10.886
YOU WOULD STILL HAVE TO HIRE AND

02:57:10.953 --> 02:57:12.955
TRAIN FOLKS AND FOR TEN

02:57:13.022 --> 02:57:15.191
POSITIONS TO HIRE WHAT TO PUT

02:57:15.257 --> 02:57:16.625
OUT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION.

02:57:16.692 --> 02:57:18.060
YOU WOULD ALMOST HAVE TO TRIPLE

02:57:18.127 --> 02:57:19.562
THAT IT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE.

02:57:19.628 --> 02:57:20.496
AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO TRAIN

02:57:20.563 --> 02:57:22.999
AND HIRE FOLKS AND IT TAKES.

02:57:23.065 --> 02:57:24.867
AT LEAST EIGHTY MONSTER FOLKS TO

02:57:24.934 --> 02:57:27.169
BE PROFICIENT -- SO WHAT TIME

02:57:27.236 --> 02:57:28.170
YOU HIRE FOLKS AND GET THEM FISH

02:57:28.237 --> 02:57:29.939
THEY PUT OUT THAT WORKLOAD THEN

02:57:30.006 --> 02:57:31.207
YOU'RE AT LA OFF MODE.

02:57:31.273 --> 02:57:33.175
SO YOU'LL BE DIFFICULT TO HIRE

02:57:33.242 --> 02:57:35.344
FOLKS IN THAT SHORT PERIOD TIME

02:57:35.411 --> 02:57:37.380
AND TO PUT OUT THE FUNDS IN A

02:57:37.446 --> 02:57:38.481
TWO YEAR PERIOD.

02:57:38.547 --> 02:57:39.949
AND THEN TURN AROUND AND LEAVE

02:57:40.016 --> 02:57:42.985
OAKS OFF SO THAT THAT WOULD BE

02:57:43.052 --> 02:57:45.021
DIFFICULT BILLS.

02:57:45.087 --> 02:57:45.821

IN TERMS OF PRACTICAL DEBT

02:57:54.964 --> 02:57:56.465

02:58:06.709 --> 02:58:07.710
SOMEHOW WE WERE ABLE TO DISPERSE

02:58:07.777 --> 02:58:09.011
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WE

02:58:09.078 --> 02:58:10.846
DON'T THINK THERE'S CAPACITY DO

02:58:10.913 --> 02:58:13.115
THAT BASED ON THE NUMBER STAFF

02:58:13.182 --> 02:58:15.184
IT'S AVAILABLE -- THE FIRST

02:58:15.251 --> 02:58:16.852
YEAR'S DESERT HAS ROUGHLY WOULD

02:58:16.919 --> 02:58:17.853
BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

02:58:17.920 --> 02:58:19.288
MILLION DOLLARS IN AN ADDITIONAL

02:58:19.355 --> 02:58:20.689
GENERAL FUND THAT IN THE SECOND

02:58:20.756 --> 02:58:22.158
YEAR IT WOULD BE SLIGHTLY LOWER

02:58:22.224 --> 02:58:23.526
THAN THAT AND THIRTY JUST.

02:58:23.592 --> 02:58:24.860
IN COMPARISON TO THE PLANNED

02:58:24.927 --> 02:58:26.429
DISBURSEMENT THAT WE'VE BUILT

02:58:26.495 --> 02:58:27.596
INTO THE GOVERNOR SQUARE SO

02:58:27.663 --> 02:58:28.464
THESE ARE GENERAL FUND COSTS

02:58:28.531 --> 02:58:30.332
THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ABSORBED

02:58:30.399 --> 02:58:32.301
IN IN SOME OTHER.

02:58:32.368 --> 02:58:34.070
AREA OF THE STATE BUDGET.

02:58:34.136 --> 02:58:34.770
I THINK THERE'S ONE OTHER

02:58:34.837 --> 02:58:35.938
IMPORTANT ASPECT I WANTED TO

02:58:36.005 --> 02:58:37.139
SHARE WITH YOU IS PART OF THE

02:58:37.206 --> 02:58:38.574
EVEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF

02:58:38.641 --> 02:58:39.708
ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

02:58:39.775 --> 02:58:41.811
OF PROCESSING APPLICATIONS.

02:58:41.877 --> 02:58:42.845
THERE IS DISTRICTS THAT ARE

02:58:42.912 --> 02:58:44.213
SEEKING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP

02:58:44.280 --> 02:58:46.015
ASSISTANCE AND SO THAT'S THE

02:58:46.082 --> 02:58:48.384
STATE MATCH PROGRAM AND SO PART

02:58:48.451 --> 02:58:50.086
OF THAT MATCH BY REQUEST IS

02:58:50.152 --> 02:58:52.822
ACTUALLY -- HAVING A FINANCIAL

02:58:52.888 --> 02:58:54.323
REVIEW IN AND OUR ORDERS TO

02:58:54.390 --> 02:58:55.891
PERFORM THAT FINANCIAL REVIEW

02:58:55.958 --> 02:58:57.526
THERE'S AN ESTIMATE ABOUT THIRTY

02:58:57.593 --> 02:58:58.427
FIVE DISTRICTS CURRENTLY THERE

02:58:58.494 --> 02:58:59.562
WOULD BE REQUESTING THAT

02:58:59.628 --> 02:59:01.197
FINANCIAL REVIEW SO OUR AUDITORS

02:59:01.263 --> 02:59:02.565
WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE.

02:59:02.631 --> 02:59:03.933
HOW MUCH FUNDS AT THE DISTRICT

02:59:03.999 --> 02:59:06.035
HAS AVAILABLE AT TO SEEK THAT

02:59:06.102 --> 02:59:07.837
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SO WHETHER

02:59:07.903 --> 02:59:09.638
NOT THE QUALIFIER THERE ELIGIBLE

02:59:09.705 --> 02:59:11.440
FOR THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE?

02:59:11.507 --> 02:59:13.309
THAT IS A COMMON OUR AUDIT STAFF

02:59:13.375 --> 02:59:14.543
TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION SO

02:59:14.610 --> 02:59:16.245
ABSENT OF HAVING THOSE AUDITORS

02:59:16.312 --> 02:59:18.280
TO DO THAT FRONT IN REVIEW WOULD

02:59:18.347 --> 02:59:18.948
BE.

02:59:19.014 --> 02:59:20.182
PROCESSING THAT GRANT THAT FRONT

02:59:20.249 --> 02:59:21.717
AND REQUEST FOR FOR STATE

02:59:21.784 --> 02:59:26.655
ASSISTANCE AN INCUMBENT OF THE

02:59:26.722 --> 02:59:28.324
OUR STAFF PROCESS IN THE THE

02:59:28.390 --> 02:59:28.991
FUNDING APPLICATION SO THAT GOES

02:59:29.058 --> 02:59:29.625
HAND IN HAND.

02:59:29.692 --> 02:59:31.660
SO IF YOU START TRIMMING DOWN

02:59:31.727 --> 02:59:32.895
THE AUDIT STAFF.

02:59:32.962 --> 02:59:33.929
THEN YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE

02:59:33.996 --> 02:59:35.764
CAPACITY TO ALSO PROCESS THE ONE

02:59:35.831 --> 02:59:36.799
POINT FIVE BILLION APPLICATIONS

02:59:36.866 --> 02:59:38.834
SO AGAIN I I THINK THAT WOULD BE.

02:59:38.901 --> 02:59:41.470
OF A MISTAKE TO OVERLOOK THAT

02:59:41.537 --> 02:59:43.205
THAT WORKLOAD AS WELL WELL THIS

02:59:43.272 --> 02:59:44.807
IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM THAT WE WILL

02:59:44.874 --> 02:59:46.375
BE REVISITING I GUESS WHAT I'D

02:59:46.442 --> 02:59:50.146
ASK IS -- FOR THE OFFICE FINANCE

02:59:50.212 --> 02:59:50.779
IN LA -- TO SORT OF GET TOGETHER

02:59:50.846 --> 02:59:55.718
AND IF WE CAN -- COME TO SOME.

02:59:55.784 --> 02:59:57.319
MUTUAL AGREEMENT ON THE NUMBER

02:59:57.386 --> 02:59:59.522
OTHERWISE I GUESS WE'LL MAKE THE

02:59:59.588 --> 03:00:00.289
DECISION AT SOME POINT IN TIME.

03:00:00.356 --> 03:00:01.423
THAT MAKES SENSE [inaudible]

03:00:01.490 --> 03:00:03.526
AND IN.

03:00:03.592 --> 03:00:05.461
ACCESS ABSOLUTELY AND IN FRONT

03:00:05.528 --> 03:00:07.463
OF ME AS ONE FINAL QUESTION IS

03:00:07.530 --> 03:00:08.364
THERE SOME.

03:00:08.430 --> 03:00:10.666

03:01:29.411 --> 03:01:30.879
LOCAL COSTS.

03:01:30.946 --> 03:01:33.882
IS A KEY ELEMENT IN ACHIEVING

03:01:33.949 --> 03:01:35.751
ADEQUACY AND EQUITY. ELEVEN

03:01:35.818 --> 03:01:38.120
YEARS AGO MICHAEL CURSED FORMER

03:01:38.187 --> 03:01:39.521
PRESIDENT OF THE STATE BOARD OF

03:01:39.588 --> 03:01:41.724
EDUCATION DID THE SAME THING.

03:01:41.790 --> 03:01:44.226
IN THE LCF OF GROUP BLUEPRINT HE

03:01:44.293 --> 03:01:45.227
RECOGNIZED THAT THEY WERE KEYED

03:01:45.294 --> 03:01:47.730
ANY RATIONAL EQUITABLE SCHOOL

03:01:47.796 --> 03:01:49.365
FINANCE SYSTEM.

03:01:49.431 --> 03:01:51.734
BECAUSE LOCAL COSTS ARE IGNORED

03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:54.503
NLC FF HOWEVER MAJOR DAMAGE IS

03:01:54.570 --> 03:01:56.038
INFLICTED ON THE POOREST AND

03:01:56.105 --> 03:01:58.507
MOST DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS IN

03:01:58.574 --> 03:02:00.576
OUR WEALTHIEST COUNTIES.

03:02:00.643 --> 03:02:02.077
THE GOOD NEWS SENATOR ROCK.

03:02:02.144 --> 03:02:03.712
IS THAT THERE IS IN FACT

03:02:03.779 --> 03:02:06.248
SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY TAX REVENUE.

03:02:06.315 --> 03:02:09.018
THAT IS ALLOCATED TO EDUCATION

03:02:09.084 --> 03:02:11.487
IN THOSE MOST EXPENSIVE COUNTIES

03:02:11.553 --> 03:02:13.355
THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING RE

03:02:13.422 --> 03:02:15.057
DIRECTED TO OTHER USES.

03:02:15.124 --> 03:02:16.592
THIS IS TAX REVENUE THAT COULD

03:02:16.659 --> 03:02:19.161
COVER THE LOCAL COST DIFFERENCES

03:02:19.228 --> 03:02:21.563
IN SAN FRANCISCO SAN MATTEO

03:02:21.630 --> 03:02:23.632
MARIN SANTA CLARA.

03:02:23.699 --> 03:02:24.433
BUT IT.

03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:26.068
CANNOT DO SO NOW BECAUSE THE

03:02:26.135 --> 03:02:27.736
STATE DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

03:02:27.803 --> 03:02:29.772
DIFFERENCE.

03:02:29.838 --> 03:02:32.675
IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE WHO WOULD

03:02:32.741 --> 03:02:34.209
POINT TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION.

03:02:34.276 --> 03:02:35.411
OF EDUCATION ALLOCATED PROPERTY

03:02:35.477 --> 03:02:37.613
TAX THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO

03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:39.415
EDUCATION I WOULD BE VERY

03:02:39.481 --> 03:02:42.017
SURPRISED.

03:02:42.084 --> 03:02:43.352
SO AND IT'S GROWING IT'LL

03:02:43.419 --> 03:02:45.154
PROBABLY GROW A NUDGE ABOUT A

03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:46.855
BILLION THIS YEAR AS A STATEWIDE

03:02:46.922 --> 03:02:49.091
ORGANIZATION WE SEE IN THESE

03:02:49.158 --> 03:02:50.526
HIGH COST AREAS.

03:02:50.592 --> 03:02:52.461
DISTRICTS CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK

03:02:52.528 --> 03:02:53.996

03:02:57.933 --> 03:03:00.135
I SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

03:03:00.202 --> 03:03:02.004
GOOD DISTRICTS DROWNING AND BAD

03:03:02.071 --> 03:03:03.906
ONES EXPLODING.

03:03:03.972 --> 03:03:05.808
SO WE HAVE TO MESH AND WE HAVE

03:03:05.874 --> 03:03:08.077
THE OPPORTUNITY TO MASH THESE

03:03:08.143 --> 03:03:09.478
THREE ISSUES IN THE MAY REVIVE

03:03:09.545 --> 03:03:09.778
[inaudible]

03:03:09.845 --> 03:03:11.313
EQUITY.

03:03:11.380 --> 03:03:13.282
LOCAL COST OF LIVING.

03:03:13.349 --> 03:03:14.483
AND SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION

03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:16.852
DOLLARS OF EXCESS EDUCATION

03:03:16.919 --> 03:03:18.654
ALLOCATED PROPERTY TAX.

OF EXCESS EDUCATION REVENUE THAT

03:03:29.798 --> 03:03:31.300
WAS FOUND IN SAN FRANCISCO IN

03:03:31.367 --> 03:03:32.401

03:04:32.294 --> 03:04:32.928
DOLLARS.

03:04:32.995 --> 03:04:34.229

THEY DO WITH THEIR LIMITED STAFF

03:04:50.312 --> 03:04:51.447
THE ONE EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR

03:04:51.513 --> 03:04:52.514
CENTER REQUIRES ALTERNATIVE

03:04:52.581 --> 03:04:54.817
PROPOSAL -- ESPECIALLY IN SMALL

03:04:54.883 --> 03:04:56.552
IN RURAL AREAS -- THAT MONEY

03:04:56.618 --> 03:04:58.086
REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE

03:04:58.153 --> 03:04:58.887
AND IF WE CAN GET OUT TO THEM

03:04:58.954 --> 03:05:01.457

03:05:07.696 --> 03:05:09.998
ASSOCIATION -- I DO WANT TO NOTE

03:05:10.065 --> 03:05:13.402
THAT IF IF OUR MEMBERS HAVE OF

03:05:13.469 --> 03:05:14.703
OUR RETIREMENT COMMITTEE AND

03:05:14.770 --> 03:05:16.605
TEACHERS WERE LISTENING TO THE

03:05:16.672 --> 03:05:18.640
CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE IN

03:05:18.707 --> 03:05:19.875
REGARD.

TO A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS

03:05:21.543 --> 03:05:23.045
VERSUS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

03:05:23.111 --> 03:05:25.447
PENSIONS AND THE CONVERSATIONS

03:05:25.514 --> 03:05:27.449
ABOUT A RETIREE HEALTH THEY

03:05:27.516 --> 03:05:28.984
WOULD BE VERY DISAPPOINTED --

03:05:29.051 --> 03:05:30.586
AND UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T

03:05:30.652 --> 03:05:32.087
BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD FEEL

03:05:32.154 --> 03:05:33.922
THAT THE PANEL WAS BIAS.

03:05:33.989 --> 03:05:34.790
OR N.

03:05:34.857 --> 03:05:36.692
SUPPORT OF DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSIONS AND RETIREE HEALTH IT

03:05:39.561 --> 03:05:40.596
WHICH HE IT IS QUITE THE

03:05:40.662 --> 03:05:42.631
CONTRARY YOU MAY PLEASE FOLKS IT

03:05:42.698 --> 03:05:43.899
WE WOULD ASK THAT IF YOU'RE

03:05:43.966 --> 03:05:45.300
GOING TO HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS

03:05:45.367 --> 03:05:47.302
ABOUT TEACHERS BENEFITS SUCH AS

03:05:47.369 --> 03:05:48.904
RETIREMENT IN RETIREE.

03:05:48.971 --> 03:05:50.772
HEALTH OBLIGATIONS THAT IT'S

03:05:50.839 --> 03:05:52.708
DONE IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR IN

03:05:52.774 --> 03:05:54.977
NEUTRAL -- AND NOT IN A WAY

03:05:55.043 --> 03:05:56.578
THAT'S DEROGATORY TOWARDS

03:05:56.645 --> 03:05:57.112
SOMETHING THAT

03:05:57.179 --> 03:05:59.414
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT WOMEN.

03:05:59.481 --> 03:06:01.717
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE IMPORTANCE

03:06:01.783 --> 03:06:03.118
OF HAVING WOMEN SITTING.

03:06:03.185 --> 03:06:04.453
IN THE CHAIRS AND WE CERTAINLY

03:06:04.520 --> 03:06:06.188
APPRECIATE STAFF IT'S IMPORTANT

03:06:06.255 --> 03:06:07.856
TO UNDERSTAND WE'RE TALKING

03:06:07.923 --> 03:06:09.758
ABOUT A GENDER EQUITY ISSUE AS

03:06:09.825 --> 03:06:13.161
WELL BECAUSE 72% OF RETIRED OR

03:06:13.228 --> 03:06:14.830
OF CAL STARS MEMBERS.

03:06:14.897 --> 03:06:15.931
ARE WOMEN.

03:06:15.998 --> 03:06:17.633
SO WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT

03:06:17.699 --> 03:06:18.934
WELL LET'S TRY TO FIND A WAY TO

03:06:19.001 --> 03:06:20.335
MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR

03:06:20.402 --> 03:06:22.170
RETIREE HEALTH OU'RE TALKING

03:06:22.237 --> 03:06:24.773
ABOUT DISPROPORTIONATELY WOMEN.

03:06:24.840 --> 03:06:26.441
BECAUSE WOMEN ALSO LIVE LONGER

03:06:26.508 --> 03:06:28.777
SO THEREFORE THE DECISIONS THAT

03:06:28.844 --> 03:06:29.811
YOU MIGHT BE WORKING TO

03:06:29.878 --> 03:06:31.146
INFLUENCE.

03:06:31.213 --> 03:06:32.681
ARE GOING TO DISPROPORTIONATELY

03:06:32.748 --> 03:06:35.684
IMPACT WOMEN AND ELDERLY WOMEN

03:06:35.751 --> 03:06:37.519
WHO LIVE LONGER STATISTICALLY

03:06:37.586 --> 03:06:39.354
THAN ANY OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC IN

03:06:39.421 --> 03:06:40.389
THE COUNTRY.

03:06:40.455 --> 03:06:41.823
SO WE WOULD ASK THAT AS YOU'RE

03:06:41.890 --> 03:06:43.592
REFLECTING ON THESE THAT YOU

03:06:43.659 --> 03:06:47.930
ALSO PUT ON A LENDS A GENDER

03:06:47.996 --> 03:06:48.730
EQUITY.

03:06:48.797 --> 03:06:49.998
AND ASK THE QUESTIONS.

03:06:50.065 --> 03:06:51.266
THAT -- YOU CAN CONSIDER THAT

03:06:51.333 --> 03:06:54.236
MIGHT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT NOT

03:06:54.303 --> 03:06:55.938
ONLY ARE ACTIVE TEACHERS BUT ARE

03:06:56.004 --> 03:06:58.307
RETIRED TEACHERS ARE GOING TO BE

03:06:58.373 --> 03:07:00.776
ABLE TO HAVE A SECURE LIVING.

03:07:00.842 --> 03:07:01.843
BECAUSE HAVING A SECURE

03:07:01.910 --> 03:07:03.879
RETIREMENT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR

03:07:03.946 --> 03:07:05.514
ISSUES THAT ACTUALLY KEEPS

03:07:05.581 --> 03:07:07.316
TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM THAT'S

03:07:07.382 --> 03:07:08.850
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY TEACHERS

03:07:08.917 --> 03:07:10.018
IN KENTUCKY.

03:07:10.085 --> 03:07:12.387
HAD A STRIKE BECAUSE LEGISLATORS

03:07:12.454 --> 03:07:13.989
AND NOT STATE WANTED TO

03:07:14.056 --> 03:07:15.490
ELIMINATE DEFINED BENEFIT

03:07:15.557 --> 03:07:17.125
PENSIONS AND MOVED TO RE DEFINED

03:07:17.192 --> 03:07:18.627
CONTRIBUTION SYSTEM.

03:07:18.694 --> 03:07:20.095
AND THE TEACHERS OF THAT STATE

03:07:20.162 --> 03:07:22.297
SAID THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK

03:07:22.364 --> 03:07:23.865
FOR US PENSIONS ARE EXTREMELY

03:07:23.932 --> 03:07:25.367
IMPORTANT SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE

03:07:25.434 --> 03:07:27.803
YOU NOT TO ENTERTAIN DISCUSSIONS

03:07:27.869 --> 03:07:29.037
OF ELIMINATING A SECURE

03:07:29.104 --> 03:07:30.706
RETIREMENT FOR CALIFORNIA'S

03:07:30.772 --> 03:07:31.640
TEACHERS.

03:07:31.707 --> 03:07:33.208
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE

03:07:33.275 --> 03:07:34.576
CONTRIBUTING MORE TO THEIR

03:07:34.643 --> 03:07:38.480
RETIREMENT BENEFITS AS WELL AB

03:07:38.547 --> 03:07:39.581
FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE IS WORKING

03:07:39.648 --> 03:07:41.683
IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED THE ISSUE

03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:44.119
IS NOT ABOUT RETIREMENT FUNDING

03:07:44.186 --> 03:07:45.687
THE ISSUE IS ABOUT A LACK OF

03:07:45.754 --> 03:07:48.090
ADEQUATE EDUCATION FUNDING.

03:07:48.156 --> 03:07:49.858
AND WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO

03:07:49.925 --> 03:07:53.395
pPARTICULARLY WHEN WE HAVE ONE OF

03:07:53.462 --> 03:07:55.130
THE LARGEST ECONOMIES HAVE.

03:07:55.197 --> 03:07:56.965
THANK YOU WELL I DON'T WANT YOU

03:07:57.032 --> 03:07:58.233
TO MISINTERPRET WHAT.

03:07:58.300 --> 03:07:59.601
OCCURRED HERE TODAY I DO HAVE

03:07:59.668 --> 03:08:00.736
COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE QUESTIONS

03:08:00.802 --> 03:08:02.571
ABOUT DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

03:08:02.638 --> 03:08:04.339
PLANS BUT I'M SURE THERE WITH --

03:08:04.406 --> 03:08:05.907
AN EQUAL NUMBER OF NOT MORE WHO

03:08:05.974 --> 03:08:07.743
DO NOT HAVE THE SAME QUESTIONS

03:08:07.809 --> 03:08:10.278
BUT I ALLOW PEOPLE TO ASK

03:08:10.345 --> 03:08:12.514
QUESTIONS IF THEY HAVE AN ISSUE

03:08:12.581 --> 03:08:13.882
AND WANT TO ASK THEM.

03:08:13.949 --> 03:08:15.283
ON THE SUBJECT OF RETIREE HEALTH

03:08:15.350 --> 03:08:16.718
CARE AND VERTICALLY RETIREMENT

03:08:16.785 --> 03:08:18.453
HEALTH CARE PROVIDED TO THOSE

THAT ISSUE JUST TO INFORM MYSELF

03:08:27.529 --> 03:08:29.931
AS TO THE REASONS WHY -- FOR

03:08:29.998 --> 03:08:31.566
EXAMPLE MEDICARE AND MEDICARE

03:08:31.633 --> 03:08:32.968
SUPPLEMENT PROVIDED BY THE

AGE SIXTY FIVE IN THE COST

03:08:42.544 --> 03:08:43.545
DIFFERENTIAL IN THAT.

03:08:43.612 --> 03:08:45.013
OTHER MAYBE SOME ISSUES I MEAN

03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:46.381
OBVIOUSLY THIS NOT FOR ME TO

03:08:46.448 --> 03:08:47.916
DECIDE THESE ARE LOCALLY

03:08:47.983 --> 03:08:50.252
NEGOTIATED -- ISSUES AND WE DO

03:08:50.318 --> 03:08:51.753

IN THIS BUILDING.

03:08:54.823 --> 03:08:57.292
FROM THIS POSITION BUT IT'S AN

03:08:57.359 --> 03:08:59.227
INTERESTING ISSUE THAT SOME

DISTRICTS ARE FACING AND THIS

03:09:00.929 --> 03:09:02.397

SIMPLY INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT

WHY -- WHY THE STAKEHOLDERS IN

03:09:07.703 --> 03:09:08.670
CERTAIN DISTRICTS MAKE THE

03:09:08.737 --> 03:09:09.971
DECISIONS THAT THEY DO AND WHAT

03:09:10.038 --> 03:09:12.340
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE IF ANY?

03:09:12.407 --> 03:09:13.442
AND IF THERE ARE NONE THAT I

COULD QUANTIFY FOR YOU THE

03:10:27.482 --> 03:10:29.151
MAGNITUDE OF THE NEED I THINK

03:10:29.217 --> 03:10:30.652
THE RESPONSE HE GOT WAS ACCURATE

03:10:30.719 --> 03:10:31.586
AND THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A

03:10:31.653 --> 03:10:33.922
STATEWIDE INVENTORY PER SE THAT

03:10:33.989 --> 03:10:35.457

BUT WE DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION

03:10:38.827 --> 03:10:40.362
THAT THAT GUIDES US THAT WAY SO

03:10:40.428 --> 03:10:42.164
WE DO KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE

03:10:42.230 --> 03:10:43.999
BACKLOG OF PROJECTS ALREADY

03:10:44.065 --> 03:10:45.233
PROCESS THAT THE STATE OF THE

03:10:45.300 --> 03:10:46.334
STATE ALLOCATION BORDERS FOUR

03:10:46.401 --> 03:10:47.969
POINT SEVEN EIGHT BILLION.

03:10:48.036 --> 03:10:50.906
AND THAT -- THE MODERNIZATION OF

03:10:50.972 --> 03:10:52.974
NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE

03:10:53.041 --> 03:10:55.510
ARE NOW OVERSUBSCRIBED SO SIMPLY

03:10:55.577 --> 03:10:57.312
IF YOU COUNT THAT ONE PROGRAM

03:10:57.379 --> 03:10:59.147
AND ALL OF THE HOOPS THEY HAVE

03:10:59.214 --> 03:11:01.750
TO GO THROUGH -- WE ALREADY KNOW

03:11:01.817 --> 03:11:05.220
THAT THE NEED IS GREAT -- SINCE

03:11:05.287 --> 03:11:06.888
199890% OF THE STATE SCHOOL

03:11:06.955 --> 03:11:08.924
FACILITIES -- PROGRAM BOND FUNDS

03:11:08.990 --> 03:11:10.725
HAVE BEN APPORTIONED WITHIN

03:11:10.792 --> 03:11:12.494
FOUR YEARS OF PASSAGE OF THE

03:11:12.561 --> 03:11:14.362
RESPECTIVE BOND AT THE CURRENT

03:11:14.429 --> 03:11:15.764
RATE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL

03:11:15.831 --> 03:11:18.600
SET AN ALL TIME LOW OF ABOUT 50%

03:11:18.667 --> 03:11:20.335
WITHIN FOUR YEARS -- WITH

03:11:20.402 --> 03:11:21.903
QUALIFIED UP STILL WAITING IN

03:11:21.970 --> 03:11:24.472
THE QUEUE UP AND WE THINK THAT

03:11:24.539 --> 03:11:29.911
THEY CAN DO BETTER -- SO WE

03:11:29.978 --> 03:11:30.445
SUPPORT MISTER MAGUIRE'S

03:11:30.512 --> 03:11:31.546
PROPOSAL TO EXPEDITE A STATE

03:11:31.613 --> 03:11:32.047
SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM

03:11:32.113 --> 03:11:34.216
APPORTIONMENT AND IN ADDITION

03:11:34.282 --> 03:11:35.684
CASH HAS OFFERED THE STATE

03:11:35.750 --> 03:11:37.219
ALLOCATION BOARD -- PCIN THE

03:11:37.285 --> 03:11:38.954
ADMINISTRATION SOMETHING THAT

03:11:39.020 --> 03:11:39.988
THEY CAN DO WITHIN THEIR

03:11:40.055 --> 03:11:41.923
EXISTING AUTHORITY TO HELP

03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:43.425
EXPEDITE THESE APPORTIONMENT

03:11:43.491 --> 03:11:46.461
SUCH AS RETURNING TO THE AB

03:11:46.528 --> 03:11:48.096
FIFTY FIVE INTERNAL LOAN PROCESS

03:11:48.163 --> 03:11:49.631
APPORTIONING ON A MONTHLY BASIS

03:11:49.698 --> 03:11:51.199
AND INCREASING THE FREQUENCY OF

03:11:51.266 --> 03:11:52.734
THE PRIORITY IN FUNDING.

03:11:52.801 --> 03:11:54.703
ROUNDS WHICH IS WHEN THEY

03:11:54.769 --> 03:11:55.604
ACTUALLY GET THE MONEY OUT THE

03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:59.274
DOOR -- OFTEN WE HEAR FROM THE

03:11:59.341 --> 03:12:00.909
ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY THEY

03:12:00.976 --> 03:12:02.377
DON'T -- MY GUESS HAVE THE SAME

03:12:02.444 --> 03:12:03.678
SENSE OF URGENCY THAT THOSE OF

03:12:03.745 --> 03:12:05.080
US IN THE FIELD TO ABOUT

03:12:05.146 --> 03:12:06.448
PROJECTS AND SPECIFICALLY

03:12:06.514 --> 03:12:08.283
BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE PROJECTS

03:12:08.350 --> 03:12:09.651
IN THE QUEUE OUR REIMBURSEMENT

03:12:09.718 --> 03:12:11.753
PROJECTS -- WE THINK IT'S VERY

03:12:11.820 --> 03:12:14.289
IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE

03:12:14.356 --> 03:12:16.024
THAT REIMBURSEMENT PROJECT THAT

03:12:16.091 --> 03:12:18.126
THE STUDENTS -- SERVE BY THOSE

03:12:18.193 --> 03:12:19.995
PROJECTS ARE JUST AS DESERVING

03:12:20.061 --> 03:12:21.129
AS STUDENTS -- WITH OTHER

03:12:21.196 --> 03:12:23.798
PROJECTS -- AND THAT IT'S IT

03:12:23.865 --> 03:12:28.270
WOULD BE UNFAIR TO TO SET UP

03:12:28.336 --> 03:12:29.704
SOME KIND OF TWO TIER SYSTEM --

03:12:29.771 --> 03:12:30.739
WE'VE ALSO HEARD FREQUENTLY

03:12:30.805 --> 03:12:34.042
ABOUT CONCERNS OF RELATED TO

03:12:34.109 --> 03:12:35.610
INTEREST ON DEBT SERVICE WITH --

03:12:35.677 --> 03:12:37.812
STATEWIDE BONDS -- BUT WE WANT

03:12:37.879 --> 03:12:39.214
TO POINT OUT THAT.

03:12:39.281 --> 03:12:41.483
INCREASING OR OR EXPEDITING

03:12:41.549 --> 03:12:43.051
APPORTIONMENT OR PROCESSING A

03:12:43.118 --> 03:12:45.186
STATE SCHOOL OF FACILITY PROGRAM

03:12:45.253 --> 03:12:46.755
PROP -- PROJECTS DOESN'T

03:12:46.821 --> 03:12:49.090
ACTUALLY INCREASE THAT SERVICE

03:12:49.157 --> 03:12:51.059
IT JUST MOVE THAT UP IN TIME AND

03:12:51.126 --> 03:12:53.328
IF YOU FACTOR IN THE TIME VALUE

03:12:53.395 --> 03:12:56.298
OF MONEY AND INFLATION COST.

03:12:56.364 --> 03:12:57.866
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY SPEND LESS

03:12:57.933 --> 03:12:59.301
MONEY IF YOU FUND THOSE SOONER

03:12:59.367 --> 03:13:01.636
AS OPPOSED TO LATER AND THEN OF

03:13:01.703 --> 03:13:03.305
COURSE -- WITH RAPID COST

03:13:03.371 --> 03:13:04.673
ESCALATION THE CONSTRUCTION

03:13:04.739 --> 03:13:07.242
SECTOR THE VOTERS AND AND THE

03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:08.310
REST OF US WOULD ALL GET MORE

03:13:08.376 --> 03:13:10.345
VALUE FOR MONEY IF WE EXPEDITE

03:13:10.412 --> 03:13:11.646
THE PROCESSING OF ALL OF THOSE

03:13:11.713 --> 03:13:12.747
PROJECTS.

03:13:12.814 --> 03:13:14.849
I THINK THAT INTERESTED TO DO

03:13:14.916 --> 03:13:15.750
WITH THEM.

03:13:15.817 --> 03:13:16.851
WITH THE MONTHLY A PORTION OR

03:13:16.918 --> 03:13:19.020
WHATEVER USE ALLOCATION WHATEVER

03:13:19.087 --> 03:13:20.555
WORD YOU USE AND THE I ASSUME

03:13:20.622 --> 03:13:21.790
THAT MEANT THE BONDS ARE SOLD

03:13:21.856 --> 03:13:22.991
AND SITTING THERE AND THEN THE

03:13:23.058 --> 03:13:24.426
MONEY IS ROLLING OUT ITS CREW

03:13:24.492 --> 03:13:26.061
STATES PAYING INTEREST ON IT OR

03:13:26.127 --> 03:13:27.095
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

03:13:27.162 --> 03:13:29.764
WITH THE USE OF AB FIFTY FIVE

03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:31.666
LONG -- THAT ISN'T YEAH THERE

03:13:31.733 --> 03:13:33.702
THERE ARE SOME INTEREST --

03:13:33.768 --> 03:13:35.870
ISSUES RELATED THERE BUT SINCE

03:13:35.937 --> 03:13:37.238
WE AS A STATE HAVE A LOT OF

03:13:37.305 --> 03:13:39.374
HISTORY USING THIS MECHANISM WE

03:13:39.441 --> 03:13:41.443
DO KNOW THAT IT ALSO ENDS UP

03:13:41.509 --> 03:13:43.178
BEING TO THE BENEFIT OF THE

03:13:43.244 --> 03:13:45.113
STATE TO THE TO THE VOTERS.

03:13:45.180 --> 03:13:46.414
THAT WE USE THAT INTERNAL

03:13:46.481 --> 03:13:47.615
MECHANISM IT'S CHEAPER THAN

03:13:47.682 --> 03:13:49.050
GOING TO THE PRIVATE MARKET AND

03:13:49.117 --> 03:13:50.118
AGAIN WITH RESPECT TO COST

03:13:50.185 --> 03:13:52.587
ESCALATION WE STILL COME OUT.

03:13:52.654 --> 03:13:54.189
BETTER BECAUSE OF THAT -- I WILL

03:13:54.255 --> 03:13:55.490

OF RECOGNIZING PEOPLE LIVING

03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:53.635
LONGER HAS INCREASED THE COST.

03:16:53.701 --> 03:16:55.403
STATE THE STATE DECISION TO

03:16:55.470 --> 03:16:57.772

INCREASED THE CAUGHT.

03:16:59.974 --> 03:17:02.143
IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST FACTOR

03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:03.244
THAT WAS LEFT OUT IS THAT.

03:17:03.311 --> 03:17:04.245
YOU KNOW IF THE STOCK MARKET HAD

03:17:04.312 --> 03:17:06.481
CRASHED THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE

03:17:06.548 --> 03:17:08.983
UNFUNDED LIABILITY SQUATS HI.

03:17:09.050 --> 03:17:10.752
AT TWO POINTS WITHIN THE LAST

03:17:10.818 --> 03:17:12.353
THIRTY YEARS IN THE LATE

03:17:12.420 --> 03:17:16.391
NINETIES IT WAS A 128% FUNDED.

03:17:16.457 --> 03:17:19.227
IN A I BELIEVE -- TEN YEARS AGO

03:17:19.294 --> 03:17:20.261
RIGHT BEFORE THE STOCK MARKET

03:17:20.328 --> 03:17:22.030
CRASH WE HAD A HUNDRED AND 1%

03:17:22.096 --> 03:17:22.997
FUNDED.

03:17:23.064 --> 03:17:24.966
OF THE THESE FUNDS.

03:17:25.033 --> 03:17:27.035
NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RUSHING

03:17:27.101 --> 03:17:28.102
TO SOLVE SOMETHING THAT LIKE

03:17:28.169 --> 03:17:30.271
MORTGAGE.

03:17:30.338 --> 03:17:31.639
WE SHOULD TRY TO PAY IT ALL OFF

03:17:31.706 --> 03:17:33.174
A COMMA THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

03:17:33.241 --> 03:17:34.742
PEOPLE ADDRESS OVER TIME THE

03:17:34.809 --> 03:17:36.711
EMPLOYEES ARE READY TO SIT DOWN.

03:17:36.778 --> 03:17:37.478
AND TALK TO THE EMPLOYEES AND

03:17:37.545 --> 03:17:39.447
WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM TO ENSURE

03:17:39.514 --> 03:17:42.650
THAT WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM.

03:17:42.717 --> 03:17:43.251
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART THERE

03:17:43.318 --> 03:17:44.485
WAS NO.

03:17:44.552 --> 03:17:46.554
RECOGNITION THAT'S THE CAN DOWN

03:17:46.621 --> 03:17:48.323
TO FAX HAD INDICATED WE HAVE A

03:17:48.389 --> 03:17:51.459
PROBLEM OF ADEQUACY HERE.

03:17:51.526 --> 03:17:52.360
SO THE FOCUS ON PENSION IN OF

03:17:52.427 --> 03:17:53.962
ITSELF OUTSIDE OF THESE CONTACTS

03:17:54.028 --> 03:17:55.730
WITHOUT RECOGNIZING ALL THE

03:17:55.797 --> 03:17:57.498
FACTORS APPROPRIATELY.

03:17:57.565 --> 03:17:59.133
COULD RUSH SOMEBODY TO JACK TO

03:17:59.200 --> 03:17:59.901
THERE'S SOME.

03:17:59.968 --> 03:18:02.003
REAL PROBLEM I HAD WITH US

03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.870
SAYING THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS

03:18:02.937 --> 03:18:03.371
THEM.

03:18:03.438 --> 03:18:04.772
BUT THIS IS BY TO POSE BORDERS

03:18:04.839 --> 03:18:06.040
DOES BOARD HAVE BEEN MOVING

03:18:06.107 --> 03:18:07.208
FORWARD TO TRY TO DAL WITH

03:18:07.275 --> 03:18:08.643
THESE ISSUES.

03:18:08.710 --> 03:18:11.246
AND WE THINK THAT WHAT THE

03:18:11.312 --> 03:18:12.313
GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING IS GREAT.

03:18:12.380 --> 03:18:12.947
PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO CLASSIFY

03:18:13.014 --> 03:18:14.515

03:18:14.582 --> 03:18:15.483
RECOGNITION.

03:18:15.550 --> 03:18:16.918
THESE FUNDS WOULD BE ADDITIONAL

03:18:16.985 --> 03:18:18.686
DISCRETIONARY MONEY THAT HELP

03:18:18.753 --> 03:18:20.521

WITH THAT POPULATION THAT WE

03:18:57.859 --> 03:18:58.660
SERVE.

03:18:58.726 --> 03:19:00.261
WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

03:19:00.328 --> 03:19:02.664

PART OF THAT COALITION AND WE

ALSO SUPPORT THE STAFFING

03:19:20.782 --> 03:19:22.650
INCREASE THAT WAS REQUESTED IN

WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE COUNTY OFFICE

03:19:29.223 --> 03:19:30.525
PROJECTS AROUND THE WORKLOAD

THAT'S WAITING FOR APPORTIONMENT.

03:19:35.930 --> 03:19:37.298
AND MOST OF THOSE ARE FINANCIAL

03:19:37.365 --> 03:19:38.866
HARDSHIP APPLICATION SO WHAT

03:19:38.933 --> 03:19:40.468
THAT MEANS IS THAT WE ACTUALLY

03:19:40.535 --> 03:19:42.203
NEED THOSE FUNDS FROM THE STATE

03:19:42.270 --> 03:19:43.004
BEFORE WE CAN COMMENCE

03:19:43.071 --> 03:19:44.539
CONSTRUCTION ON THESE IMPORTANT

03:19:44.605 --> 03:19:45.506
PROJECTS.

03:19:45.573 --> 03:19:46.541
THERE ARE PROJECTS ON THE LIST

BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IT'S

03:19:49.711 --> 03:19:51.813
FIVE YEARS LATER AND WE ARE NOT

03:19:51.879 --> 03:19:53.214
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT.

03:19:53.281 --> 03:19:54.682
SOME SORT OF INTERNAL BORROWING

03:19:54.749 --> 03:19:55.783
OR SOME SORT OF SPECIAL

03:19:55.850 --> 03:19:58.219
MECHANISM AND MANY OF MY MEMBERS

03:19:58.286 --> 03:19:59.520
ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT IN ORDER

03:19:59.587 --> 03:20:00.588
TO PROVIDE THESE NEEDED

03:20:00.655 --> 03:20:01.823
FACILITIES.

03:20:01.889 --> 03:20:03.391
I'M THEIR BEEN QUESTIONS THAT MY

03:20:03.458 --> 03:20:04.926
COLLEAGUE RAISED ABOUT THE

03:20:04.992 --> 03:20:07.028
REIMBURSEMENT QUESTION YOU KNOW

03:20:07.095 --> 03:20:08.429
DO YOU CREATE TO TEARS.

03:20:08.496 --> 03:20:10.531
FIND THOSE FIRST TWO NEED THE

03:20:10.598 --> 03:20:11.899
FUNDS IN ORDER TO COMMENCE

03:20:11.966 --> 03:20:13.434
CONSTRUCTION WE DO NOT AGREE

03:20:13.501 --> 03:20:14.669
WITH THAT APPROACH EVEN THOUGH

03:20:14.736 --> 03:20:16.070
WE'RE THE ONES THAT MAY BENEFIT

03:20:16.137 --> 03:20:18.773
FROM DOT WE BELIEVE THAT ALL --

03:20:18.840 --> 03:20:20.641
PROJECTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE AND

03:20:20.708 --> 03:20:22.176
HAVE MET THE STATE LAWS THAT

03:20:22.243 --> 03:20:25.279
WERE IN PLACE WHEN THEY SUBMIT

03:20:25.346 --> 03:20:25.847
IT SHOULD ALL BE TREATED THE

03:20:25.913 --> 03:20:26.981
SAME -- WE KNOW THE NEED IS

03:20:27.048 --> 03:20:28.216
THERE WE KNOW THAT THE STATE HAS

03:20:28.282 --> 03:20:29.584
THE CAPACITY TO FUND THESE

03:20:29.650 --> 03:20:30.585
PROJECTS.

03:20:30.651 --> 03:20:31.819
I THINK THE QUESTION REALLY

03:20:31.886 --> 03:20:33.654
ABOUT THAT SERVICE IS WHAT

03:20:33.721 --> 03:20:36.057
BUDGET YEAR WILL YOU A CREW AND

03:20:36.124 --> 03:20:38.025

03:20:38.092 --> 03:20:39.861
OBLIGATION THE OBLIGATION IS

03:20:39.927 --> 03:20:41.129

03:20:41.195 --> 03:20:42.597
THIS BUDGET YEAR NEXT BUDGET

WE KNOW WE HAVE TO ADMINISTER

03:20:45.600 --> 03:20:46.934
NINE BILLION DOLLAR BOND PROGRAM

03:20:47.001 --> 03:20:48.436
THAT WAS APPROVED BY VOTERS.

03:20:48.503 --> 03:20:49.771
KNOWING THAT THERE WAS A COST

03:20:49.837 --> 03:20:51.305
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO WITH

UNIFIED IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY I

03:21:35.116 --> 03:21:36.684
THINK IT PROVIDES A GOOD

03:21:36.751 --> 03:21:38.386
OPPORTUNITY TO ASSURE THE

03:21:38.453 --> 03:21:40.087

ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME TO

03:21:58.673 --> 03:21:59.640
LIGHT AND THE INITIAL

03:21:59.707 --> 03:22:01.442
CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU DIDN'T

03:22:01.509 --> 03:22:02.810

DURING YOUR CONVERSATION -- THIS

03:22:05.179 --> 03:22:06.914
MORNING WAS THAT OUR OUR INITIAL

03:22:06.981 --> 03:22:08.916

03:22:08.983 --> 03:22:10.985
STRATEGIES THAT THE DISTRICT WAS

03:22:14.856 --> 03:22:16.190
WHAT ESSENTIALLY HAVE REMOVED

STRATEGIES FROM THEIR LOCAL

03:22:17.525 --> 03:22:19.760

STABILIZATION PLAN THAT

03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:40.147
SATISFIED.

OF OUR FISCAL TEAM I HAVE BEEN

03:22:42.383 --> 03:22:44.318
DEVELOPED AND NOW IT REALLY

03:22:44.385 --> 03:22:45.887
RESTS IN THE HANDS OF THE

03:22:45.953 --> 03:22:47.221
GOVERNING BOARD.

03:22:47.288 --> 03:22:50.725

ABOUT A TWENTY MILLION AT TWENTY

AROUND MAY REVIVE VISION TO TO

03:28:13.414 --> 03:28:14.782

03:28:14.849 --> 03:28:16.317
WHEN THAT PROGRAM IS UNDER

03:28:16.383 --> 03:28:19.820
FUNDED -- IT DOES CREATE -- PRO

03:28:19.887 --> 03:28:21.555
RATIONS AND SO SCHOOLS ARE ARE

03:28:21.622 --> 03:28:24.291

THEIR FUNDING FOR FACILITIES

03:28:26.193 --> 03:28:27.828

THE ELIGIBILITY LEVEL THE

03:28:38.606 --> 03:28:39.874
CONCERN WE HAVE WITH IT IS THAT

03:28:39.940 --> 03:28:42.076

LESS YOU CHOOSE TO DO THAT IN

03:28:47.815 --> 03:28:49.683
THE BUDGET SO THERE'S ALL ALWAYS

03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:50.651
GOING TO BE THIS MISMATCH UNLESS

OUR MODEL FOR FACILITIES HAS

03:29:45.539 --> 03:29:47.274
ALWAYS BEEN TO OPERATE IN THESE

03:29:47.341 --> 03:29:48.442
FACILITIES.

03:29:48.509 --> 03:29:50.177
IT ALLOWS US TO NEGOTIATE FOR

03:29:50.244 --> 03:29:51.745
LONG TERM FACILITIES WE ENTER

03:31:44.024 --> 03:31:46.293
65%.

ALL THE STUDIES SAY YOU NEED 85%.

03:31:49.897 --> 03:31:51.532
