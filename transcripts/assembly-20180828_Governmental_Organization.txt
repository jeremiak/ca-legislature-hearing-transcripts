BUT THINKING CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VICE CHAIRMAN. KNOW TIME IS SHORT AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT I THINK I'LL JUST FOCUS ON ON THE MANAGER'S EXPAND UPON THIS. WEEK AND IT HERE ALL DAY WE HAVE MUCH TIME YES SIR THAT WE'RE NOT YET IT AMENDMENT SO I THINK FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES ONE IS -- TO SPECIFIED THAT THE TRIBAL ADVISOR A POSITION WHICH IS CREATED IN THIS BILL -- MUST BE AN ENROLLED MEMBER OF THAT FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THAT POSITION. THIS CLARIFIES THAT A SECOND CATEGORY IS I JUST THINK TO CLARIFY THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE. OF THE THE PRIOR LANGUAGES HAVE APARTMENT FOR REPORT THIS SPECIFIES THAT THE TRIBAL ADVISED TO WILL REPORT TO THIS COMMITTEE. AND DESCENDED GEO. ANNUALLY WITH THEIR THAT ISSUE SAID THAT IF. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT HAD THROUGH ITS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY SOME AMENDMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO SOME OTHER ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED I NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO CAN DO SO. IN ADDITION.

SINGER รณ WE DO HAVE A QUESTION OVER HERE MISS WALDRON. JUST THIRD CLARIFICATION QUESTION SO THE TRIBAL ADVISER IS A MEMBER OF A TRIAL A TRIBAL GOVERNMENT. BUT THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL APPOINTED MUST BE ELECTED TRIBAL LEADERS. HIS THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO THAT THE TRIBAL ADVICE MUST BE ENROLLED MEMBER NOT NECESSARILY MEMBER OF A GOVERNMENT. THAT WE SPECIFIED THAT. THAT FOR THE INITIAL PROCESS BECAUSE THE TRIBAL ADVISER WILL BE WORKING WITH THE PANEL TO ESTABLISH THE PROCESS TO CREATE THE FORUMS THE REGULATIONS OR WHATEVER THE SPEED AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS MUST BE ELECTED TRIBAL LEADERS. BEYOND THAT THE PROCESS FOR ELECTING THE PANEL WILL BE DONE THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH ALL TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS -- PUT IN THE BILL LANGUAGE BECAUSE THAT REFLECT THE WILL OF THE TRIBES AND BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD -- THROUGH THAT CONSULTATION PROCESS RETAINER TWEAK YOUR DO WHATEVER SO WE FELT THAT.
