THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND TO THOSE LISTENING IN FOR JOINING IN THIS CONVERSATION WE HAD A SIMILAR MEASURE A FEW YEARS BACK WHERE WE WERE LOOKING AT WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING BUT SPECIFICALLY IN IN TRUCKEE HUNTED SPECIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD THAT- WERE IN DANGER- THERE WAS A ROBUST DEBATE ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF. OF THAT STRATEGY AND REALLY TRY TO PLUG WHAT WE SEE IS A HOLE IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH TO- INTERNATIONAL WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BUT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE INVOLVED- AND WE'RE NOW SEEING NOT JUST ISSUES IN TRAFFICKING OF. PARTS BUSTS OTHER SORT OF QUOTE UNQUOTE TROPHIES BUT ALSO IN TRAFFICKING OF OTHER WILDLIFE- SPECIES THAT FRANKLY SHOULDN'T BE COMING INTO OUR STATE- THAT THE DON'T POSE A SIGNIFICANT- BENEFIT TO SOCIETY HERE AND REALLY FRANKLY POSE ADDITIONAL RISKS WHETHER IT'S A RISK OF. SYNODIC INFECTION- AND WE STILL OBVIOUSLY DO NOT HAVE THE ORIGINAL AND PROGNOSIS FOR WHAT CAUSED COLLUDED BUT- THERE ARE STE THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF SPECULATION THAT. THERE WAS A TRANSFER- FROM ANIMAL TO PERSON- BUT MORE BROADLY. THE TRADE IN WILDLIFE BOTH IMPORTANT AS WELL AS A SALES POSES REALLY A THREAT TO OUR ECOSYSTEMS OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE BY DIVERSITY IN THIS STATE- SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO STAY FOCUSED HERE IN PROVIDING THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO GET DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS- FROM. ANIMAL TRAFFICKING IN SALES THAT COULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON THEIR HEALTH- THE WELFARE OF THE STATE AND FRANKLY- THE WELFARE OF BY DIVERSITY ACROSS THE WORLD WE ARE IN A MASS EXTINCTION EVENT- MAKE NO DOUBT- IT'S HAPPENING ON OUR SOIL HERE. WITH YOU LOOK AT- SPECIES LIKE THE MOUNTAIN LION- OR EVEN OUR OWN SALMON POPULATIONS- BUT ABROAD AS WELL. AND I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE SIT IDLY BY AND NOT TRY TO BRING THIS BILL BACK AND MAKE ANOTHER PUSH- BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE JUST TOO HIGH. HENCE THE REASON FOR BRING IT UP THIS SESSION IN A TIME WERE REALLY TRYING TO LIMIT JUST OUR MOST URGENT LEGISLATION- THE BILL% WAS VETOED. A FEW YEARS BACK AS IF YOU RECALL- BY GOVERNOR BROWN. CAN IN THE IN THE INTERIM PERIOD THE SITUATION IS NOT GOT MUCH BETTER- WHETHER FOR ENDANGERED AFRICAN LIONS- OR RHINOS. LEOPARDS BUT ALSO- SPECIES LIKE PANGOLINS- BABOONS INFECTED HAD A SIGNIFICANT- DOWN TICK. SO I'M OUR HOPE IS THAT THIS WON'T BE A FEW LACK FROM THIS LEGISLATURE SHOULD WE PASS THIS LEGISLATION AGAIN- AND THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME- CAN LEND HIS OWN UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON- THIS INTERNATIONAL. ABOUT DIVERSITY CRISIS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION NEVER GAR NICE AND I WILL GET A FEW DETAILS IN A BIT- AND I KNOW WE HAVE SOME LEAD WITNESSES HERE NICHOLAS SACKETT WITH SOCIAL PATTERSON LEGISLATION AS WELL AS BRENDAN COMING TO THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY.

I WOULD- ASKED FOR THOSE THAT ARE ON THE LINE THAT HAVE I'M ON BOTH SIDES OF SUPPORT AND- OPPOSITION IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GET ON THE LINE TODAY I THINK THE GENERAL. WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EMAIL THAT IN AND- WE WELCOME THOSE. COMMENTS THIS IS JUST THE FIRST COMMITTEE FOR THIS BILL IT'S GOT SOME COMMITTEES TO GO AND GET IN ADDITION TO THE FLOOR. AND SO THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME TO REGISTER BALL SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION- SEEN IT THERE'S NO OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN FORTY TWO OR THREE WILL BRING THE DISCUSSION UP TO THE DíAS MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION ON ALL OF. SEVENTY FIVE BY. SENATOR STERN BEFORE WE START THAT CENTERS I. BEEN OFFERED ARE YOU EXPECTING IN RENTS ARE TODAY YES HI. THANK YOU. ANY ANY DISCUSSION FROM THE DíAS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR- AND LET ME JUST START OFF BY SAYING THAT I YOU SUPPORTED YOUR OTHER BEARD BILL. THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE AFRICAN. I HAVE ICON SPECIES AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A FULL WORD THERE THAT I'M MISSING- AND I. BUT THIS BILL IS DIFFERENT. AND IT'S DIFFERENT BASED ON MAY AMENDMENTS LATE MA'AM MA'AM AND MEN MINTS AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- I HAVE A REALLY UNUSUAL SITUATION IN MY DISTRICT THAT- IS CAN CONTINUALLY. AT RISK- I HAVE A- A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS A SMALL BUSINESS A NON PROFIT RESCUE- AND IT'S I THINK THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH IN THIS IS THAT IT'S A LOGICAL ASSOCIATION LETTER SO I WON'T GO. WITH THEM AND IN DETAIL- IT SOUNDS LIKE- THEIR POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A CONVERSATION AND WORKING IT OUT. AND YOU KNOW IF THAT HAPPENS THAT'S GREAT BUT RIGHT NOW THIS WOULD KILL KILL HIS OPERATION AND- FOR THAT REASON I'M GONNA BE I'M GONNA BE LAYING OFF. SO I URGE YOU TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION VERY REASONABLE PEOPLE- AND I. WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO COME AND TAKE A LOOK AT HIS. AT HIS SO IT THERE IT'S REAL. AWESOME WITH THAT I'LL I'LL JUST IT. THANK YOU SO CARILLO BOARD. IT'S DIFFERENT EVERY TIME HE TRIES. IT LOOKS GOOD GOVERNMENT IN IRAQ OFF COURT. TRY ONCE MORE YOU HAD IT THE FIRST TIME. YEAH YOU'RE GOOD THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW FOLKS KNOW THIS ONE OF THE BOTTLES KEEP ON COMING UP ON THE SCREEN BATTERY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD ON HOW TO CONDUCT THE MEETING BUT I ALWAYS I I'D LIKE TO ONE. I THANK THE CHAIR OF DEVICE YOU'RE IN THIS SITUATION ALONG ME TO COMMENT- PERHAPS I CAN DIRECT MY QUESTIONS. REALLY IT'S I THINK IT'S JUST ONE. AND IT HAS TO DO WITH- SEVERAL PREEMPTION. YEAH I WAS LOOKING AT THIS AND THIS REALLY IS A COMPOSITE BILL OF. TWO POSSIBLY THREE THAT. MIGHT BE HELPFUL IF THEY WERE IF THEY WERE DRAFTED SEPARATELY BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT- IN ORDER FOR US TO GET CERTAIN THINGS THEY END UP WITH THAT WITH THE CALL THE PRIORITIES THAT WAS DONE THIS WAY NINE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT IF I CAN POSE A QUESTION THROUGH THE SHARE HER. TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. IS THE ISSUE OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION AND- I'M GONNA READ. A SECTION HERE THAT. CAPTURES MY ATTENTION. THAT SAYS ANY STATE LAW. FOR REGULATION WHICH APPLIES. TO THE IMPORTATION OR EXPORTATION ARE OF ENDANGERED SPECIES ARE THREATENED SPECIES IS A BOARD. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT PROHIBITS WHAT IS AUTHORIZED PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION OR PERMIT PROVIDED I IN THIS CHAPTER SO MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS IS. I IMAGINE THIS FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUE EXISTED WHEN THIS WAS DEALT WITH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. BUT HOW DO WE NOT JUST A GREAT THAT. THERE IS FEDERAL PREEMPTION BY THE CLEAR LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE POSSIBLY YOU CAN FEEL PREEMPTION- ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH ON THAT BUT MAYBE IF I COULD JUST POSE THAT QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE OVERCOMING. WHAT HERE'S TO BE CALM. DID THE LAW. THROUGH THE CHAIR THE ABSOLUTE- THANK YOU SENATOR. WE WRESTLED WITH THIS ISSUE SQUARELY- FRANKLY WE WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD A WE THOUGHT A WORKABLE FRAMEWORK BUT WHEN POWER CHANGED HANDS. AND THE AND THE IMPORTATION LAWS WERE AMENDED- AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES WERE SORT OF GIVEN BLANKET EXEMPTIONS FOR IMPORTATION WE FELT THE NEED TO STEP IN- WE ADDED AMENDMENTS. SINCE THE LAST TIME WE BROUGHT THIS BILL FORD THAT WE THINK ADDRESS THAT FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE- THE BILL IS MORE FOCUSED- LESS FOCUSED ON SORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES AND MY CAN APPRECIATE WHAT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION IS SAID ABOUT. THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT BANNING- THIS HUNTING- IN AFRICA- AS WELL AS THE IMPORTATION OF WHATEVER THEY CONSIDER A TROPHY INTO THE UNITED STATES- ARE BILLS REALLY FOCUSED HERE ON- WHAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE THINK THAT- WELL THE BILL ACTUALLY DOESN'T- DOESN'T ACTUALLY DâN THE HUNTING ITSELF- THE IMPORTATION IN POSSESSION OF THOSE TROPHIES WE FEEL LIKE THE STATE IS ON PRETTY SOLID LEGAL GROUND THERE- TO BE TO BE ADDRESSING THAT WITHIN OUR OWN BORDERS THAT WE DON'T INTRUDE BOTH ON SITE EASE. AS WELL AS FEDERAL LAW I WE RECOGNIZE THAT MAY BE AN ONGOING DEBATE GOING FORWARD- BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR- THIS BILL IS ROUGHLY ABOUT. THAT PORTION THE BILL IS REALLY ABOUT THE TROPHY AND NOT THE HUNT ITSELF REGARDLESS OF HOW FEEL. I'M PERSONALLY. INCOME WITH THE NOTION OF. SHOOTING AT M. OR TAKE THE ANIMAL ANY ANIMALS LIFE FOR PURPOSE OTHER THAN FOOD IT SEEMS STRANGE TO ME TO GO- SHOOT A BUNCH OF AFRICAN LIONS ELEPHANTS- UNDER THE AEGIS OF CONSERVING THEM- BUT I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO SET THE EFFICACY OF THAT PRACTICES SIDE HERE AND REALLY JUST FOCUS ON. THE TROPHY ITSELF- AND POSITION AND SALES WITH IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR ARGUMENT. MISTER CHAIR RIGHT DO A FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR. WELL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NEW JERSEY FELT THE SAME WAY THAT THEY TOO WANTED TO FIND WAYS AROUND THE FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUES AND ULTIMATELY LOST SO. I GUESS MY FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE SHOULD WE AS A COMMITTEE. RACKLEY AUDIE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WILL FIND ITS WAY INTO THE COURTS IN BASED ON THE PRESIDENT THAT WE'VE SEEN IN JERSEY. OUR ANTICIPATE THAT THIS PROVISION WILL BE KICKED OUT IN THE COURTS. A LOT SOONER STERN EITHER ANSWER THAT ORG OR KICK IT TOO IS GAS AND I AND I CAN ADDRESS BRIEFLY MY CLOTHES BUT I THINK I AND NUMBER SACKETS HERE JUST TO DIG INTO JUST A LITTLE MORE LEGAL NITTY GRITTY FOR PURPOSES OF THE PUBLIC RECORD AND LET HISTORY HERE SO. SURE SO NEW JERSEY HAD TO DO WITH SALES AND- THE STATE DECIDED NOT TO DEFEND THE LAWSUIT ACTUALLY WAS NOT ADJUDICATED AND ALSO I JUST WANNA GIVE ONE EXAMPLE. OF WHY WE BELIEVE THIS WON'T BE PREEMPTED- YOU NEED TO GET- FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE PERMITS FOR LIVE ANIMALS- TO pBUT- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN SAY HEY. EVEN THOUGH THE FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE GAVE YOU A PERMIT TO BRING THIS TIGER AND- YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A LIVE TIGER IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND THIS IS THE SAME PREMISE IS. THE FEDS CAN GIVE YOU PERMIT TO BRING INTO THE COUNTRY BUT WE'RE SAYING YOU CAN'T POSSESS IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. SO IT'S MORE OF A STATES RIGHTS ADVOCACY POSITION GOT ITS ACT YEAH YOU GOT IT SO. I'M FOR SMALL LOCAL OUR STATE BASED GOVERNMENT. CAREFUL CAREFUL NO I KNOW I I'M I'M I'M GONNA GET YOUR VOTE ALL OF A SUDDEN- THANK YOU FOR RAISING THE ISSUE THE SENATE. CENTER BARGES ANYTHING ELSE. MISTER MODERATOR DO WE HAVE THE WITNESSES ON THE LINE STILL- MISTER MOON NEED TO OFFER OR MS SENSOR. GO AHEAD YOUR LINES ARE OPEN. I JUST WANT ASSN US IS A CENTER JONES I JUST WANT TO ASK- PERMANENT SECRETARY MOON TO OFFER IF HE COULD- JUST ADDRESS MAYBE A COUPLE OF SPECIES THAT AS ZIMBABWE'S BEEN TRYING TO. MANAGE THROUGH THIS PROCESS IN A THE LIONS OR THE ELEPHANTS POPULATIONS ABOUT IN ZIMBABWE CAN YOU- KIND OF EXPLAIN HOW THIS BILL WOULD. PENDER OR HELP- THOSE POPULATIONS. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH REGARDS TO THE ELEPHANTS EXACT CD IF WE ARE GOING TO. GET THE MANAGEMENT PROCESS IF IT'S COLD CAMPFIRE IS COMMUNITY BASED SO IF THE COMMUNITY IS THAT GET THE- THAT REVISION YOU'LL FROM HYUNDAI NOW IF THE BILL EFFECT OFF THE BILL IS SUCH THAT IT CRIMINALIZES HAVING TROPHIES IN CALIFORNIA. EFFECTIVELY IT ALSO MEANS THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT HUNT WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT. COM YOU THAT'D BE GET THE OUT. FROM HUNTING WILL NOT HAVE THAT LATELY QUOTE. THE CURRENT STATE OF OUR ECONOMY IS SUCH THAT WE FIND CONSERVATION SOLD THE CONSERVATION FUND ARE COMING FROM HANDING WHICH I'VE FEET BEHIND BEST WHICH I'VE WHICH I NEED ALSO TO HIGHLIGHT THAT FOR VIOLENCE. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO HIGH AND I OWNED IT THE EDGE OF YEARS. AND YOU CAN ONLY HI THEY MAY. THAT ABOUT SIX OLD NOTE IF. NOT TOLD THE AGE OF. THIS STRUCTURE ALSO OR TO AND IF I. H. RESTRICT BUT ALSO WE STICK TO MAY. DATA ABOUT WE SIT IN TRADE SHOW IN TEN OF A- YOU KNOW WORDS YOU'RE NOT IN THE- WITH DEADLY BACK. OFF THIS. YES SIMPLY MANAGING OUR DOOR THAT. OLD ENOUGH OR TECHNOLOGY. WITH THAT. SO CAN YOU THE. I THINK THAT THAT'S CREATURE HELP THAT TO NEED TO BRING OUT IN THIS DAY. WE THINK AND IN THIS THAT SORRY YES YES YOU MAY GO AHEAD OKAY THEY THINK YOU'RE THE THAT KIND I WANT TO GIVE A MISTER SERVICE OPPORTUNITY TO AND HI OF THE THAT SHE UP IN A TEST READ. THE SCIENCE PA PLATFORM ON BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES REPORT WHICH WARNED THAT A MILLION SPECIES ARE AT RISK OFEXTINCTION DOES THAT REPORT IDENTIFIED LEGAL REGULATED HUNTING AS A CAUSE OF THOSE EXTINCTIONS. IT DOES NOT OKAY GREAT THANK YOU- I THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S THE LIMIT OF MY YOU KNOW QUESTIONS I WANT TO GIVE OUR WITNESSES ESPECIALLY MISTER MOON TO OFFICE SINCE HE IS CALLING ALL THE WAY IN FROM ZIMBABWE AND I THINK IT'S- YOU NO LATER THAN MIDNIGHT THERE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. YOU KNOW I'LL SAY. AND ONE OF THE WITNESSES I'M NOT A MEMBER OF SAFARI CLUB INTERNATIONAL- I'M NOT ON THE BOARD. I'VE YOU KNOW I'VE- I'M NOT THAT STRONGLY AFFILIATED WITH THEM BUT I HAVE BEEN TO A COUPLE OF THEIR- ANNUAL BANQUETS IN SAN DIEGO AND I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A BIG ONE AND- I THINK RENO NEVADA. AND I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF. OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE ON THE DíAS IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO ONE OF SAFARI CLUB OR NATIONALS- ANNUAL BANQUETS TO ATTEND ONE. AND IF YOU'VE NOT EVER BEEN INVITED TO ONE I CAN HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN I THINK. BUT YOU'LL REALLY SEE THE ACT I'LL TO WHAT WAS WHAT WAS. I WAS TAKEN WITH IS THE CARE AND CONCERN. THAT PEOPLE TO SUPPORT THIS ORGANIZATION HAVE. FOR ANIMALS NOT JUST HEARING IN CALIFORNIA NOT JUST HERE IN THE UNITED STATES BUT AROUND THE GLOBE PARTICULARLY THE CONSERVATION EFFORTS THAT THEY- USE. IN AFRICA AND OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THE AMOUNT OF AMERICAN DOLLARS. THAT GOES TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. THOSE CONSERVATION EFFORTS WOULDN'T HAPPEN ES VIBRANTLY IS A DO IF IT WASN'T FOR AMERICAN DOLLARS NOW COURSE THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES THAT SUPPORT THOSE THOSE THOSE EFFORTS AS WELL. BUT THE PROFESSIONALISM THE CARE THE CONCERNED THAT THESE FOLKS EXHIBIT TOWARDS MAKING SURE THAT THESE ANIMALS ARE CONCERNED THAT THESE HUNTING LANDS ARE CONSERVED SO THAT THESE ANIMALS CAN SURVIVE AND CONTINUE AND NOT GO EXTINCT. IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE AND I THINK THAT THE STORIES THAT WE GET SENSATIONALIZED HERE IN UNITED STATES ABOUT HUNTING IN THESE OTHER COUNTRIES A LOT OF TIMES WERE NOT GIVEN THE COMPLETE STORY THAT IT'S POACHERS. THERE ARE- TRESPASSING ON TO THESE RESERVES AND PRESERVE. IT'S YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT AREN'T FOLLOWING THE LAWS AS THESE COUNTRIES HAVE THEM SET UP TO PROTECT THESE ANIMALS AND I THINK FOR THE MOST PART WHEN CALIFORNIANS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS ACTIVITY THERE DOING IT LEGALLY THEY'RE DOING IT MORALLY THEY'RE DOING IT- HONORABLE IN WITH THE MINDSET OF. THEY WANT TO PERPETUATE THE SPECIES. ARE CONTINUALLY SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'LL SAY AND I SEE THAT I- EXCITED SOME EXCITED IS SOME. COMMENTS FROM CENTER ALANSON AROUND WELL I JUST I GUESS I AM I AM I WAS LOSING YOUR COMMENTS SENATOR AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE COMMENTS WERE MADE BY THE AUTHOR I MEAN I KNOW IT DOES SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE. TO YOU KNOW TO EQUATE HUNTING WITH PRESERVATION AND- SERVE IN SOME RESPECTS LIKE I HEAR YOU I ALSO KNOW THE SAME TIME. SOMETIMES THE GREATEST CHAMPIONS FOR- YOU KNOW FOR WHAT FOR OUTDOOR SPACE AND IN FACT. YOU THAT FOUND THE FATHER OF THE- OF THE MODERN NATIONAL PARK THE ROOSEVELT LARGELY WAS. MIA MADE HIM HIS PASSION FOR THE NATIONAL PARKS AND PRESERVATION OVER SPACE WAS WAS DONE BECAUSE OF HIS LOVE FOR HUNTING. YOU KNOW I THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF MY OWN TRAVELS IN AFRICA I WELL I'VE I WENT TO A RWANDA AND HAVE THE CHANCE TO GO AND- SEE THE GUERRILLAS THERE IN THE IN THE JUNGLE AND I AM CERTAINLY SENSITIVE TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE MINISTRY. ABOUT HIM. ABOUT THE MONEY THAT THE- TERRORISTS BRING INTO BECAUSE I WASN'T HUNTING WE'RE JUST LITERALLY GOING TO SEE THESE. THESE BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS- IN. INDIA BUT BUT THE MONEY THAT IS BROUGHT IN FROM TERRORISM IS VITALLY IMPORTANT IN HELPING TO FIND. THE EFFORTS TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT AND ULTIMATELY IT'S THE LUNAR THE LOCAL VILLAGES IN HAND TO STAND UP AGAINST THE POACHERS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY- ARE GETTING MONEY FROM. THE GOVERNMENT. THAT IS LARGELY FUNDED BY THE TERRACE TO COME IN AND SEE THAT THE GUERRILLAS. WHERE WHICH TURNS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIENTS A DOZEN OF HUNTING IN PEOPLE CONSERVE IN HIM SEE THE ADAM WITHOUT KILLING SO ANYWAY I JUST I WANT TO I'M AYE AYE GODS WE SHARE YOUR PASSION FOR- PROTECTING INTERNATIONAL BIODIVERSITY AND I. YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER SEEN THE- THE ATTRACTION TO. SEE A BEAUTIFUL HOME IN THE IN THE WILD AND WANTED TO. SHOOT IT DOWN. YEAH SO I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS HERE CENTER BUT I DO I DO WANT TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON. THIS DIFFICULT BALANCE- THAT EXISTS EVEN THOUGH YOU AND I MAY NOT SHARE THIS EAT US- INVOLVING- HUNTING ANIMAL TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS SOMETIMES OVER POPULATION I KNOW WE HAD ALL DEBATE OVER KANGAROOS IN AFRICA THEY- CERTAIN AFRICAN AUSTRALIA. TOWARD YOU KNOW- THEY SEE IT AS A YOU KNOW THE PAST- OR THE GOOD LOOKS OVER POPULATED. AND THERE IS A WAY TO GET ANYA IN THIS THIS VERY COMMITTEE WELL SOMETIMES IT WE APPROVE BILLS- TO ALLOW FOR INCREASED TAKE. OF CERTAIN ANIMALS- WE DO ALLOW FOR HUNTING OF ANIMALS- IN OUR OWN STATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS LONG AS IT'S DONE IN A WAY THAT. YOU KNOW PROPERLY PRESERVES AND PROTECTS- THE ADEQUATE NUMBERS- FOR ABOUT ADVERSITY SO I LOVE I YOU KNOW I GUESS MY QUESTION VIEWS DO YOU HAVE SORT OF AN ABSOLUTE OPPOSITION. TO ANY HUNTING. OF THESE ANIMALS IN AFRICA- DO YOU SEE HOW DO WE HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE KINDS OF ARGUMENTS ADMIT BASIN AND- I. DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE. YOURSELF MOVING THE DAY. WITH THESE KINDS OF IN MIND. IT WAS ISLAND ME RE THE COMMITTEE THAT WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LEFT. ONE HOUR TIME LIMIT NOT RECOGNIZE ROLE DINNERS WITH CHOOSE TO GO THERE ARE. IF WE- I THINK AT TWO TWO BUT I DO A TO RE. THIS WERE OR ABOUT FOR TIM UP AGAIN THE ONE HOUR MARK. I'LL BE THERE VERY BRIEF IN MADE ELABORATE FURTHER IN MY CLOSING ELSE DID HONEST RESPOND CENTER COPYRIGHT. I CLOSE TO APPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK THERE. ON SAY VERY BRIEFLY- REGARDLESS OF MY FEELINGS ABOUT HUNTING. TIGHTENING DANGER SPECIES. BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T STAND HUNTING OF THOSE SPECIES. AND THE EFFORTS THAT YOU KNOW WITH THE FACT THAT. THEY'RE PAYING ME YEAH FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR- HUNTING FEE FOR AN AFRICAN ELEPHANT OR THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM MALE AFRICAN LINE AND- IF WE DO IN FACT TRUST THOSE GOVERNMENTS TO GET THAT MONEY BACK TO THE PEOPLE OF WHICH- THERE'S BEEN A MIXED RECORD. FRANKLY IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY GETTING THAT TO COMMUNITY BENEFIT BUT- SETTING SETTING THAT ASIDE- THIS WOULD DO. NOTHING TO ACTUALLY INTERVENE AND WHATEVER THAT KIND OF. ALLEGE CONSERVATION COMMERCE IS- THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE TROPHY AND BRINGING IT BACK TO CALIFORNIA- IF THE HUNTERS. RIDGE CARE ACT HEY. I WANT TO TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD THAT THEY DO HAVE. MORAL AND SHIN DENNIS SORT OF. EITHER THEN IN IN THAT HUNTING ACTIVE. TAKE A PICTURE AND COME HOME. WHAT WHY DO YOU NEED A TROPHY TO COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA WITH TO SHOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE- IF IT REALLY IS ABOUT. THE SORT OF PROUD WAS THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH WHATEVER THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE TROPHY IS- TAKE A PICTURE AND PUT IT ON YOUR INSTAGRAM. IF THAT IF THAT YOU THINK WILL EARN YOU THE STRIPES BUT- I DON'T THINK THAT COMMERCE. AND FRANKLY A BLACK MARKET THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT KIND OF COMMERCE AS ANY PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S BEYOND OUR JURISDICTION TO REALLY REACH INTO HOW THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE CONDUCTS ITS AFFAIRS AND SO. THE BILL DOESN'T ENDEAVOR TO INTERVENE IN THAT REGARD IT'S REALLY WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE FACT. THE SENSOR ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE DíAS. CENTER JACKSON YEAH VERY BRIEFLY- I HAVE HUNTERS IN MY FAMILY THEY HAVE A RULE THAT THEY ONLY. YOUR WITH THEIR GOING TO EAT. SO THEY HAVE TRIED TO SET SOME PARAMETERS AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THE TASTE OF MILK BUT- ARE HAD IT AND THE COOKED RIGHT. THAT COULD BE BUT DON'T TELL MY SON IN LAW THAT VIDEOS AND COOKED IT RIGHT ALL CARE DOCTOR I TAKE THAT BACK SO BUT MY POINT IS THAT I THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO THIS- I THINK THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY ABUSES. AND YOU KNOW WE GIVE OUT HUNTING LICENCES FOR DEER IN THE FALL BECAUSE THE GOAL IS TO THIN OUT THE HEARD BEFORE WINTER SET AND WHERE THEY MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE SURVIVE EITHER SO. I DON'T SEE THIS IS TAKING AWAY WHAT I WOULD CONSTRUED HUMANITARIAN REASONS FOR HUNTING BUT- THE NOTION THAT. A PASSING THIS BILL WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE SURVIVAL OF WIDE LIFE I THINK IS JUST A TERRIBLE OVER REACH IT REMINDS ME OF A- AN OLD QUOTE WE USED TO HAVE BACK IN THE DAY WHEN WE HAD A WAR GOING ON VIETNAM WAR. KILLING FOR PIECES LIKE. **** FOR CHASTITY- AYE CHESTER- I JUST DON'T THINK AND THAT'S A QUOTE THAT QUOTE I'M- FOR THE A BUMPER STICKER. THEY ACTUALLY I THINK THEY DID I THINK THEY DID BACK IN THOSE DAYS BUT THE BUT THE POINT IS THAT. AT THAT THIS IS THE- THIS IS NOT GOING TO END THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO- TO HUNT GAME TO DO THINGS THAT ARE. ECOLOGICALLY APPROPRIATE AND I KNOW MANY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD TODAY ARE VERY STRONG CONSERVATIONISTS. THEY ARE BECAUSE THIS IS THEIR PLAYGROUND THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE THEY GO OUT AND COMMUNE WITH NATURE AND- AND- IN ENJOY ITS BENEFITS AND ALSO AND ALSO HUNT- BUT I THINK THE TO. THE THIS CALLING THIS BILL SOMETHING IT'S KNOCKING OVER DRAMATIZING ITS IMPACT I THINK. MOVES US AWAY FROM THE ACTUAL- ESSENCE OF THE BILL AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO. TO MOVE THE BILL AND THEN ASK THE AUTHOR TO- YOU KNOW TO KEEP THE DISCUSSIONS GOING- BUT I DO THINK THAT ITS ESSENCE IS A GOOD ONE AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE. I THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THOSE THAT ARE WATCHING THE COMMITTEE- AND OR LISTENING TO IT THAT WE DO THE- THE COMMERCE COMPANY DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAD SOME CHALLENGES ON ON THEIR LINE. RECOGNIZING THE NUMBERS THERE WAS ALSO- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION. SO IF YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO GET ON THE LINE TO RECORD TO REGISTER YOUR SUPPORT AND OUR OPPOSITION. PLEASE SEND THOSE. IN WRITING. AND IF YOU NEED THE CONTACT INFORMATION IT'S ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE. AS SOON WE CAN JUST GOOGLE CALIFORNIA SENATE. AMID ON NATURAL RESOURCES IN THAT WILL COME UP. AND WE ARE HAPPY TO RECEIVE YOUR COMMENTS WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION ON SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE BY STERN. WILL ALLOW THE AUTHOR TO CLOSE AND THEN WE WILL TAKE A VOTE. VERY GOOD AT TAKING HIS CHAIR- JUST WANTED A KNOWLEDGE CENTER CUBBY HEROES CONCERNS AND COMMIT TO LOOKING INTO THE ISSUE AND FOLLOWING UP WITH YOUR LOCAL. AS WELL AS- MISTER DUNNE'S FOLKS IN IN LOOKING AT- WHAT SORT OF CHANGED SINCE THE LAST VERSION INTO NOW AND- WHAT KIND OF NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS THAT COULD HAVE- SO THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT. OKAY I'LL I'VE EVER PEATED BUT AT. WE ARE ON THE BRINK OF A MASS EXTINCTION EVENT GLOBALLY WE ARE FENDING NATURE DEEPLY TERMS OF HOW WE MOVE ANIMALS ALIVE OR DEAD AROUND THE WORLD IN TERMS OF HOW WE EAT ANIMALS IN TERMS OF HOW WE CONSUME THEM AND TREAT THEM AS COMMERCE- AND THEREFORE NOT HUMBLED IN THIS MOMENT BY THAT OFFENSE- MINUTES GRAVE CONSEQUENCES THAN I THINK- IT. THE WORST IS YET TO COME- SO I HOPE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY PUT SOME KIND OF CLARITY AROUND- WHERE CALIFORNIA STANDS IN TERMS OF CONSERVATION AND HOW THAT CONSERVATION MISSION REALLY ALIGNS WITH OUR OWN BIO DIVERSITY GOALS AND OUR PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS- WE ARE GOING TO BE A HEALTHIER MORE SUSTAINABLE AND MORE PROSPEROUS CALIFORNIA- WITHOUT- THIS TROPHY HUNTING IMPORTATION PROCESS INTO THE STATE AS WELL AS- OTHER SPECIES THAT MAY POSE A RISK TO OUR HEALTH OR- BY DIVERSITY THE STATE WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU HAVE A MOTION FROM CENTER JACKSON TO DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS IF YOU CAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS ON SB ONE ONE SEVEN FIVE STERN.

GOOD AFTERNOON NOW MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS YUP MINE HERE ON MY DISTRICT OFFICE JIVING WITH YOU. BOB ON THIS SLIDE BEAL I WANT TO FIRST THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND CERTAINLY YOUR STAFF ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS. FOR THE TIME AND CONSIDERATION BEING GIVEN OUT THE BILL AS YOU MENTIONED ALL PRESENT THE BILL BUT I'M NOT ASKING FOR A LITTLE TOO DAY. FOR OUR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUT YET SERVING OUT SOME SORT OF STRUCTURE FOR DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD. IT IS KERN FORM SB NINETY REQUIRES LOCAL SO COMMISSION TO FOLLOW THE COASTAL ACT. AND GROUND HER MEDS TO CITIES COUNTIES OF STATE AGENCIES AND PROPERTY OWNERS FOR THE INSTALLATION OF COASTAL MITIGATION PROJECTS. AS SET FORTH IN PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE THREE OH TWO THREE FIVE. UNDER CURRENT LAW ANY CONSTRUCTION THAT WALTERS THE SHORELINE MUST BE PERMITTED BY THE COASTAL COMMISSION OR PRESIDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO THAT END SB ESTABLISHES A TIME LINE FOR THE PERMITTING PROCESS. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO APPROVE OR DENY AN APPLICATION. FOR A COASTAL MITIGATION PROJECT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF IT SUBMISSION AND WE HAVE DISCUSSED ABOUT. DISCUSS THAT TIME LINE AND MAYBE A LITTLE TOO TIGHT. BUT CERTAINLY- WE HAVE TO GET SOMETHING THAT'S MORE CERTAIN BECAUSE CURRENTLY THE RESPONSE TIMES FOR PERMIT APPLICATIONS OFTEN TAKE MONTHS. AND IN SOME CASES YEARS THERE IS ONE IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT'S GONE ON FOR A COUPLE YEARS. TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE OF PROPOSAL A PROJECT PROPOSAL THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AS THE DELAY IN THEIR RESPONSE TIMES AND LEFT ON COASTAL BLUFFS. VIRTUALLY UNCHECKED WE NEED BEACH GOERS PROPERTY OWNERS VULNERABLE TO THE DANGERS OF COASTAL EROSION. WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED- IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN AT GRANDVIEW BEACH IN ENCINITAS CALIFORNIA. WHEN A OCEAN FRONT BLUFF SUDDENLY COLLAPSING KILLED THREE MEMBERS OF DR PAT DAVIS IS FAMILY. WHO HAD GATHERED THERE TO CELEBRATE A VICTORY OVER BREAST CANCER OF HIS SISTER IN LAW- ELIZABETH WASN'T THE FIRST TIME NOW THAT IT'S HAPPENED IN OUR DISTRICT.

BEACH NEAR THE BAY OF STROLL BEACH IN ORANGE. SOUTHERN REGION ORANGE COURT A RESULT EVOLUTION DRIVEN A ROW. YOU KNOW THE TWO NINTH AND MAY BLOW WHERE IN THE ON MAR. PUT THEM HIGHER.

AND TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR HOMEOWNERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITIES. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF OUR MY KEY WITNESSES- CHARLES MAKE YOUR IMAGE.

HI I APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO. BELIEVE ME IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO GO OUTSIDE AND GROUND IN MY SORROWS.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES ON THE BEACH ON SEPTEMBER SECOND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I LOST MY WIFE JULIE MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER ANY ANY. AND MY SISTER IN LAW ELIZABETH. THE SIMPLEST COLLAPSE. IF WE WERE TO RATE THE DANGERS OF THE BLOCKS IN OUR AREA ON A ONE TO TEN SCALE WE ARE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO PASS. WHERE THE CITY OR STATE. THEIR CASES WHERE THEY PLACE LIFE GUARD TOWERS I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FEEL SAFE WHEN THEY'RE CLOSE TO THESE THINGS. I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PICK UP MY PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO HELP ME SAVE LIVES. THERE IS NO PLAN FOR ST REPLENISHMENT OR ANY OTHER BLUFF CHANGES TO INCREASE SAFETY ON THE VERY POPULAR STRETCH OF BEACH BETWEEN BEACONS AND GRAND VIEW WHERE MY ACCIDENT OCCURRED. I WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO COME DOWN HERE TO WALK THE BEACH WITH ME AND SEE FIRSTHAND OUT DANGEROUS THESE BLOCKS ARE.

HI THANK YOU THIS IS JENNIFER SAVAGE FROM THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION THANK YOU CHARACTER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THAT THEY NOTING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCACY INVESTED ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDE BY NATURE OF PROFOUND FOCUSED ON PUBLIC SAFETY WERE OFTEN INSPIRED INTO EXISTENCE BECAUSE SOMETHING OF HARMING OUR COMMUNITIES. WE UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO PROTECT PEOPLE BY FIXING PROBLEMS AND OUR HEARTS OUT THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS TRAGEDY I IMAGINE EVERYONE LISTENING CAN RELATE TO THE SHOCK INCREASE LEAKING LOCAL AND AN ACCIDENT AND WE ABSOLUTELY MUST DO OUR BEST. TO PREVENT FUTURE TRAGEDIES THAT CALIFORNIA. WE LOVE THE BEACHES. I'M FORTY THERE BILL WE DO NOTHING TO PROVIDE. GOING EXPERIENCE THE PUBLIC UNLESS YOU CONSIDER LIMóN THE COULD EIGHTY NINE. BECAUSE THAT WHAT HE DO DESTROY THE BEAT A MEETING AT THE RED. COASTAL ENGINEER HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE KIND OF HARD ARMORING AND YOU CAN NINETY ADVOCATE FOR DOES NOT MAKE BEACH IS SAFER AND IN FACT WILL ACTUALLY MAKE THE MORE DANGEROUS EACH STATE IS REDUCED OR ELIMINATED AT HIGH TIDE AND. WITH WRITING HE- THERE WHAT START OUT OF. TREATMENT CRISTINA DIEGO AND COUNTY WILL BECOME. OTHER COSTA PROPERTY OWNERS CAN. LEADING TO THE LOSS THE PUBLIC BEACHES ALL ALONG CALIFORNIA. ALL OF THE IS WHY YOU'RE CAN HAS THE AN ACT OF ELEVEN HUNDRED EMAIL OPPOSING THE BILL. TELL ME BETTER OPTION EXIST ONE THAT BALANCE IT PUBLIC SAFETY. WITH THE RIGHT ACCESS THE BEACH WITH PROTECTING PRIVATE INTEREST AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO HOLD THE STILL AND TO HOLD ON TO CALIFORNIA'S ROLE AS A LEADER AND PROTECTING IT. COVERAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SAVAGE EARNED NEXT WE HAVE A SIR CRISTINA BELIEVE WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION. IN THIS BE THE FINAL PIECE AFTERNOON SHARE STERN AND MEMBERS I'M SURE CHRISTY WITH THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION THE STATE AGENCY THAT PROTECTS OUR COAST FOR CURRENT FUTURE GENERATIONS. THE COMMISSION HAS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE. BUT WITHOUT QUESTION EVERYONE FEEL DEEP SYMPATHY FOR THE FILM FAMILIES WHO SUFFERED THIS TERRIBLE LOSS IT'S A HEARTBREAKING TRAGEDY AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THEY WANT TO CHANNEL THEIR GRIEF IN THIS WAY. MEMBERS WE MUSTN'T CONFLATE TRAGEDY WITH THE BILL BEFORE YOU. WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATE STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER SHORELINE ARMORING. IT'S NOT NECESSARY IT WON'T PREVENT A SIMILAR EVENT. AND IT WILL HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON PUBLIC BEACHES COASTAL ACCESS AND CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL ECONOMY. TO BE CLEAR THE ENGINEERS BLUFF DIDN'T GIVE WAY BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DENIED A RETAINING WALL TO PROTECT PUBLIC AFETY THERE. THE COMMISSION HAS NEVER RECEIVED SUCH A REQUEST. NOR HAS THE COMMISSION EVER DENIED A PRIVACY WALL IN THIS LOCATION. IN FACT THE ENGINEERS ARE READY TO BE ARMORED. TERRIBLE ACCIDENT WAS JUST THAT AN ACCIDENT NOT THE RESULT OF ANY ACTION BY THE COMMISSION OR LACK THERE OF. WEAKENING THE COASTAL ACT WON'T REMEDY THAT. BEAR IN MIND THAT 32% OF SAN DIEGO'S COAST IS ALREADY ARMORED AND 27% OF ORANGE COUNTY SO IT'S NOT AS IF THE COMMISSION DOESN'T EVER APPROVED SEA WALLS. WE DO ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WITH EXTENSIVE SCIENTIFIC SURVEYS AND FULL MITIGATION TO MAKE THEM CONSISTENT WITH THE COASTAL ACT. SB TEN NINETY PROVIDE THE COAST ELECT CAR ABOUT FOR ALL TYPES OF SHORELINE ARMORY THE COMMISSION WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE SEE WALLS BY RIGHT AND WOULD LOSE IMPORTANT AUTHORITY OVER LOCAL APPEALS. WOULD SET A CAP ON SANTA MEDICATION A WHAT. WOULD AMOUNT IN. TIES MITIGATION TO REAL ESTATE VALUES INSTEAD OF ACTUAL IMPACT. AND IT WOULD EXEMPT THE WALLS CLOSE PAULA. IN THOSE TO ACCESS. RECREATION HABITAT PROTECTION. THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT FASTER EASIER AND CHEAPER TO BUILD THE WALLS PRIMARILY TO PROTECT PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS. AND FOR EVERY SHE WILL THAT IS BUILT THE PUBLIC LOSES THE BEACH. THERE ARE BETTER OPTIONS THE COMMISSION IS ONE OF SEVERAL AGENCIES CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT FIND SPACE PRINCIPLES TO ADAPTED SEALABLE RIGHT STATEWIDE. THE COMMISSION IS ALSO WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUFF BAKER LC PIECE. SEVERAL BOMB BILLS INCLUDING A REGIONAL RESILIENCY BILL BY THE PRO TEM. AND IN ONE THAT PROVIDED FUNDING TRIP RESEARCH EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS TO PREDICT WHAT WHAT'S COLLAPSE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLD THE RECALL THAT NINETEEN. WE HOPE THESE PROMISING BILLS ARE INTRODUCED NEXT SESSION BUT IN THE MEANTIME TEN NINETY SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY MEASURE THAT MOVES FORWARD THIS YEAR PLEASE HOLD THIS BILL TODAY SO WE CAN WORK ON MORE EQUITABLE SOLUTION NEXT SESSION. THANK YOU MY MOTHER A LITTLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE ACTUALLY WE'RE NOT TO EIGHT SINCE OUR OTHER TESTIMONY THE AGREEMENT WITH THE AUTHOR WAS THAT- WE HAVE JUST LEAD TESTIMONY AND THEN SHE WOULD CLOSE SO AT THIS JUNCTURE- CENTER BATES WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO. TO WRAP UP HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU AND I THINK WHAT'S GREAT TODAY THAT THE DISCUSSION HAS STARTED AND OF COURSE BOB. I THINK WE COULD DEBATE ALL AFTERNOON OF WHETHER OR NOT THE BILL ACTUALLY PROMOTE SEA WALLS ACTUALLY. THE MITIGATION MEASURES THAT ARE MENTIONED IN THE BILL ARE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM. PROBABLY RESOURCE. COLD THAT EXISTS TODAY AND SEA WALLS ARE IN THERE. I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE AGREE AND SCIENCE AGREES THAT THAT'S THE LEAST DESIRABLE OPTION AND CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF. IF THIS BILL OR SOMETHING LIKE IT BECOMES SO THE INSTRUMENT. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING AMENDED OUT OF THAT ALSO AS I MENTIONED THE TIMELINE PUTTING. MORE PRESSURE ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION THEIR THEIR WORK PRODUCTS ON MANY OTHER PROJECTS CAN CERTAINLY BE ADDRESSED. SO I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT START I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT. YOU PROVIDED TO US SENATOR STERN FOR DISCUSSIONS ON PREVIOUSLY AND TODAY- MY GOAL IS CLEARLY TO ENSURE THAT OUR INCREDIBLE COSTA RESOURCE. ARE YOU HERE FOR ALL TO ENJOY PROTECTING- SURFRIDER SEND THEIR- DESTINY INTERESTS PROTECTING OUR PROPERTY OWNERS- THEIR VESTED INTEREST OUR BEACH GOERS THE SAFETY. OF FOR ALL OF US ARE. WITHOUT A COAST. GUARD BEACH IN CALIFORNIA IT'S KIND OF NOT CALIFORNIA SO. WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE WE JUST HAVE TO FIND OUT. THE RIGHT WAY TO. PUT WHATEVER WE'RE GOING TO FINALLY DECIDE ON THAT PAGE AND IT HAS TO BE I THINK A COMPROMISE. ON A FEW. BUT WE WILL GET THERE SO INCREASE THAT I FORWARD WORKING WITH YOU. AND IT STERN ANY OTHER I'LL BE OF OUR OF OUR STATE CALLED GROUP. THANKS AGAIN THANK YOU SENATOR BATES ENDED I STAY BY MY- NOT JUST TO WE UNTIL NAY YEAR BUT PUT GENUINE EFFORT IN THIS YEAR- WITH YOUR COMMUNITY- WITH SOME OF THE ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN SPEAKING ON THE LINE- AND COMMEND YOU AND YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN YOUR REGION REALLY FOR- NOT LETTING THIS ISSUE LIE AND REALLY PUSHING IT TO THE FORE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR- VIGILANT ADVOCACY HERE- AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU.

BUILD SOME KIND OF PARTNERSHIP HERE AND- I'VE BEEN JOINING SENATOR HUESO IN SOME OF THESE INNER. INTERFACES WITH- THE FOR THE GOVERNMENT DOWN THERE AND REALLY APPRECIATED MOVING FOR TO LOOK FOR TO PARTICIPATING IN UPCOMING CONVERSATIONS WE THINK THIS BILL- IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE FRAMEWORK FUNDING IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL THERE IS SOME MONEY IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WE ALSO KNOW THE INTERNATIONAL. BOUNDARY AND WATER COMMISSION. HAS REALLY YET TO LEAN IN AND BUILD THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE TO FIX THE PROBLEMS OF CALIFORNIA'S.

AT CENTER WEST WAS IN HERE- BUT HE MAY BE WATCHING IF IT'S CRAZY- AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL I THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THERE'S SOME REAL NEED TO PUT THE RESOURCES DOWN THERE BUT- THE BILL DOESN'T ANSWER HOW ALL THE OTHER WORKED IT'S GONE BEFORE. MEASURES IN WITH THIS SO I THINK THERE'S SOME ELEMENTS MISSING- THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE GET INTO THE BUSINESS OF. REPORTS ON TOP REPORTS AND GROUP'S MEETING ON TOP OF GROUPS AND THEN THEY DON'T WORK TOGETHER AND THAT DOESN'T HELP SO. I'M I'M GONNA SUPPORTED TODAY BUT I THINK IT NEEDS SOME WORK BEFORE COME TO THE FLOOR.

I WILL BE BRIEF- I DO NOT MEAN TO BE INFLAMMATORY OR- OR- OVERLY DRAMATIC IN MY LANGUAGE BUT I TRULY THINK OF UNMITIGATED CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BANKRUPT NOT ONLY STATED CALIFORNIA BUT- THE NATION AND THE ENTIRE WORLD- I DO NOT THINK WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FISCAL RISKS I THINK WE HAVE A VERY GOOD SENSE OF SCIENCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE DONE GREAT WORK ON OUR CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENTS BUT DRILLING DOWN THE ACTUAL. PHYSICAL LIABILITIES ON OUR BOOKS FROM UNMITIGATED CLIMATE CHANGE IF THAT'S A MATTER OF GETTING A HEAD ON FIRE PREVENTION- IF THAT'S A MATTER OF MITIGATING SEA LEVEL RISE BEFORE IT- SWALLOWS OUR COMMUNITIES ARE INFRASTRUCTURE IF THAT IS A MATTER OF GETTING AHEAD OF OUR TRAP SO IT DOESN'T CAN'T COLLAPSE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. WE STILL DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND ON A SECTOR BY SECTOR BASIS WHAT THOSE LIABILITIES ARE AND FRANKLY WITH THE LIABILITIES ARE TO THE GENERAL FUND AND I'M WORRIED THIS YEAR EVEN IF WE GET HIT. WITH ONE CATASTROPHE OR MULTIPLE CATASTROPHES WE HAVE NOT EVEN BUDGETED FOR THAT CONTINGENCY IN OUR CURRENT BUDGET YEARS OF THIS BILL HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET BETTER DATA TO BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION SO WE CAN MAKE SMARTER DECISIONS IN REAL TIME THIS IS NOT ABOUT A HYPOTHETICAL TWENTY FIFTY STUDY- ONLY THIS IS ABOUT A DRILLING DOWN A NEAR TERM IMPACTS AND HOPEFULLY AVOIDING THEM TO THE EXTENT WE CAN. I HAVE JONATHAN PAR FREE WHO REALLY APPRECIATE HIS WORK CLIMBER SOLVE HERE'S A LEAD WITNESS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A- THANK YOU. MISTER FEW KEY DIAL UP MISTER PAR FREE PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. YES THIS IS LOUIS BLUMBERG- JOHNSON WAS- CALLED AWAY TO THE PHONE WAS NOT ABLE TO PRESENT AND HE ASKED ME TO GO IN AND REPRESENT HIM FOR QUITE THERE WAS ALL. IT WAS ALSO COURSE SB THIRTEEN TWENTY- IT'S- RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STAB WATCHING THE CRIME IS ASSESSMENTS IN LAW. THE PRIOR APPROACH TO THESE ASSESSMENTS WAS HAPHAZARD AND WITHOUT REAL DIRECTION ORGANIZATIONS CERTAINTY. AS WE SAY IN WHAT THE CODE SITUATION THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD UPDATES ON. THIS IS CENTRAL TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE ANOTHER DISASTERS. WE WANT TO APPLAUD SENATOR STERN FOR INTEGRATING INCLUDED ECONOMIC ANALYSES OF HOW CLIMATE CHANGE CAN AND WILL WILL AFFECT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL ACQUIRING IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND IT'S IMPORTANT ADDITION TO THE EVOLUTION OF THESE QUAN ASSESSMENT THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR MANY YEARS. WE ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING EXTREMELY WHICH. IS INSUFFICIENT ATTENTION THEN OF COURSE WE MUST CONTINUE AT THE EXIT THE MAIN THE EGGS NO OF THESE ASSETS. WHICH INCLUDE ALL REPORT. STATE WHY ORIGINAL IN OUR AND FOR STING LEADER POURED READ LOCAL AND STATE. USING CLIMATE. RESILIENCE ACTIONS THAT IN THIS CONTEXT ADDING ECONOMIC ANALYSES WOULD BE A GREAT COMPLIMENT TO THE STRUCTURE. NOW TRADITIONALLY RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THE SCIENTISTS WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELDS AND THEN THERE BEEN DISTILLED INTO THE CLIMB THE STEPS THAT WE LIKE THAT IDEA IT'S BEEN WORKING. AND WE BELIEVE ANY ECONOMIC ECONOMIC CITY SHOULD BE BROAD THE SCOPE- RATHER THAN PRESCRIPTION WE SHOULD ALLOW THE RECEIPT RESEARCHERS TO RESPOND TO THE CRITERIA DEVELOPED BY OPR. TO PROPOSE OR INDIVIDUAL STUDIES BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THEY KNOW BASS. ONE OTHER LITTLE POINT WE WANT TO MAKE THIS IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT ETHICS. FOR TARGET SHOULD NOT SPECIFIC YEARS. BEYOND AS SENATOR STERN I WANTED. TO ASK FOR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE PREVIOUS BILL THE IMPORTANCE OF FUNDING- NOT IN THIS BILL BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOUR BE A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING. FOR THIS CLIMATE ASSESSMENTS WE NO LONGER HAVE THE PEER PROGRAM THAT WAS FUNDED FOR MANY YEARS BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS. PUBLIC GOODS CHARGE SO WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR STERN BERGER LEADERSHIP. ON THIS BILL WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE TO POINT YOU IN THE BILL AS A MOTION THE PROCESS.

THANK YOU MISTER MARIO BRING BACK THE DíAS QUESTIONS FROM THE DIS SENATOR MINING AND THEN CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND. MY EXPECTATION IS THE RESISTANCE DOWN THE ROAD NOT A POLICY COMMITTEE BUT MAYBE AROUND THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION I WOULD JUST ARGUE IN ADVANCE OF THAT REVIEW. THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL INVESTMENT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS SOME ARGUE THAT COVERT NINETEEN IS A MANIFESTATION OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. MORE RECENTLY ARE WILD FIRE CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA HAS DISTORTED OUR STATE'S BUDGET IT'S IMPACTED MILLIONS OF RESIDENTS. MANY TRAGIC LOSSES OF HUMAN LIFE AS WELL AS PROPERTY WERE AT THE PRECIPICE WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS OF NEEDING TO RETOOL. HOW WE LOOK AT BUDGETING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW WE LOOK AT BUILDING AND PROTECTING A FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRAND CHILDREN IN GENERATIONS AHEAD. TO ME THIS IS A MODEST STEP BUT A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ONE SO THAT WE CAN BEST- MANAGER LIMITED RESOURCES AND ARE STRESSED RESOURCES TO PROTECT OUR SHARED IN COMMON FUTURE SO NOT REALLY A QUESTION BUT A COMMENT IN SUPPORT AND I'D BE GLAD TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR BYE SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I AGREE WITH THAT WITH SENATOR MINING AYE I THINK THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS TO BUILD AN ECONOMIC MODEL THAT INCLUDES RURAL CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE'RE NOT JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU KNOW. THE OCEAN RISING SEA LEVEL RISE AND- CLIFFS FALLING DOWN NOT IN THE OCEAN BUT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE IMPACT THAT THE ACTIVITY HAS IN A BASIN THAT HAS NO WAY FOR THE ERROR THE POLLUTED AIR TO GET OUT OF IT ONCE IT GETS IN THERE- AND THE TREMENDOUS IMPACT IT HAD IT HAS ON THE HEALTH OF THE INHABITANTS BUT ALSO. THE ROLE THAT AGRICULTURE PLAYS IN- SO QUITE SO QUITE STRING CARBON AND- YOU KNOW THE I THINK THIS- THIS WHOLE COALBED. PANDEMIC HAS GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE. THE IMPACT. OF OUR- DAY TO DAY LIFE HOW IT IMPACTS. OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THE FACT THAT THE AIR IS pNEVER BEEN CLEANER THAT THE ROADS ARE ARE PRETTY EMPTY AND THAT ALL OVER THE WORLD YOU'RE SEEING WILDLIFE. COME BACK IN A WAY THAT NONE OF US WOULD HAVE PREDICTED- SO YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT CAN HELP US GET- ON THAT CAN HELP US TO REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE MUCH FASTER AND- SO I THINK YOU KNOW SO I WOULD ASK THE RATHER THAT THEN BE PRESCRIPTIVE IN THIS. LEGISLATION THAT WE PROVIDE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOOKING AT THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY- BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT ARE DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND ARE HAVING SOME SOME SUCCESS SO I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. OUT SO EN AND SO AS A FOOTNOTE I THINK YOU SHOULD OUT AT THE DEPARTMENT FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AS ONE OF THE CONSULTING DEPARTMENTS SO THAT WERE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE INCLUDING THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT MAKES A 100% SENSE AND- OF THE WAS IN TEND TO BE IN- OVERSEEING THE TIME LOOKING PASTINJECTED THE SPEARS AND AGRICULTURE AND IT'S LIKE THIS YEAR. I MEAN THE MEGADRIVE IS HERE NOW. GROUNDWATER SUBSIDENCE HERE RIGHT NOW POTENTIAL FOLLOWING OF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS IT'S ALL VERY SCARY SO- WE NEED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT BUT MAYBE IF WE CAN BE SORT OF MORE COMPREHENSIVE IT WON'T. YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED TO SIR TO DRILL PIECE BY PIECE BUT- I APPRECIATE THAT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE DíAS CENTER JACKSON. IS I TO WILLOW WANTED THANK YOU FOR THIS. YOU KNOW WE'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME CLIMATE CHANGE IS OCCURRING AND IT IS OCCURRING ALL OVER. IT DID IT'S NOTHING THAT IS UNIQUE TO ANY PARTICULAR PART OF THE STATE. OR THE COUNTRY- AND IN FACT I REMEMBER YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD SOMEONE TESTIFYING I THINK IT WAS A SCIENTIST ABOUT. THE PROSPECTS OF WHAT THE CHANGES IN THE CLIMATE MEAN- USING THE OCEAN AS AN EXAMPLE BUT THE FACT THAT WHEN THE WATER TEMPERATURE RISES HE GIVES RISE ALSO TO BACTERIA THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AND THAT IT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE FOOD CHAIN WHETHER IT'S IN THE OCEAN WHETHER IT'S IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHETHER IT'S IN YOU KNOW MINNESOTA. OR KANSAS AND SO- I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT THIS IS A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW WE HAVE THIS VIRUS AND NOBODY'S EVER SEEN OR HEARD OF BEFORE. MY FEAR IS THAT GIVEN THE CHANGES THAT THE CLIMATE IS GOING TO THIS IS. NOT THE LAST THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE AND WE'VE SEEN THEM COMING OVER THE COURSE WE WERE WE STARTED WITH. I THINK WAS SARS IN THE BOWL OF WHEN YOU THINK OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF THESE POTENTIAL PANDEMICS THAT HAVE OCCURRED ENDING MEASURE THAT WHICH MINOR SEES A SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING THEY'RE CONNECTED. BETWEEN THE INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE. AND THE CREATION OF ALL OF THESE NEW. NO POP A BOWL BY THREATENING COULD. I IT. WHEN WE ALL COME. ON THIS AND SO I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT AND- I'M GLAD THAT WE ARE TALKING NOW IT IS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS US ALL- AND DOES NOT LIMIT ITSELF TO ONE PARTICULAR PART. OF AN AREA AND IT'S JUST REAL AND- IT SHOULDN'T BE POLITICAL- SO I HOPE THAT IS A CAUSE FOR WE ARE ALL SITTING AT THE TABLE TOGETHER AND- WORKING AT COM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FOR THE S. NOW WE DO HAVE A MOTION I THINK IT WAS FROM CENTER MONNING- SO YOU MAY CLOSE AT THE MYSTERIES CHAIR AND THANK YOU MEMBERS THREE COMMENTS AT. I WAS GOING TO THE LANGUAGE AND- WE- WE- WHILE WE DO CALL OUT AGRICULTURE. AS WELL AS FISHERIES AND- NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES IN BUSINESS AND TRADING EXTREME HEAT ON LABOR PRODUCTIVITY A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPACTS WE TRY TO BE PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE BUT- WE'LL WE'LL BE WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION HOPEFULLY FLESH THIS OUT AND DO THIS INTO THE CURRENT DIALOGUE. I THINK THE FACT WE'RE DEBATING ABOUT TO PUT. A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR BOND ON THE BALLOT IN IF THAT'S TO ME TO COMMIT TO THE FIGHT. THE MISTAKES THE SCOPE OF THE FIGHT AND- WE'RE TALKING IN A SINGLE DIGIT BILLIONS IN TERMS OF EXPENDITURES ON MITIGATION WHETHER IT'S HELPING AGRICULTURE THROUGH THIS SIR. OUR COASTAL REGIONS ARE THOSE WHO ARE EXPOSED TO FIRE. ONE OF MARK STORM THE USGS MODEL THIS ARC STORM THEY USED THE NUMBERS BASED ON THE EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO GREAT FLOOD THAT CENTER GOVERNOR TO THIS VERY CAPITAL IN A CANOE. DOT IF WE IF WE HAD A SIMILAR FLOOD- IN MODERN DAY CALIFORNIA THE ESTIMATED THE COST IMPACT AT SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION. DOLLARS ON ONE FLOOD ALONE- THE OVERALL ESTIMATES ON GLOBAL COSTS ARE A RECENT STUDY PROJECTS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TRILLION DOLLARS BY END OF CENTURY BUT THOSE NEAR TERM- ABSOLUTELY I MEAN YOU CAN ONLY CALL IT SORT OF A BIBLICAL LEVEL OF PROPORTION AND- OUR STORM WAS NAME OF THEIR SCENARIO BUT- THE DISRUPTIONS TO. URBAN CALLED STOLEN LAND. JUST OF LIFE LINES TO THE STATE FOR DAYS OR WEEKS. I WOULD CAL. IF WE DON'T GET AHEADOF IT THIS YEAR AND MOVE REAL MONEY AND REALLY GET A SENSE OF THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THAT NEAR TERM ACTION- I WORRY WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE UNDER WATER IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER- SO WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IPHONE. THANK YOU WE CAN CALL THE ROLL CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS SB THIRTEEN TWENTY STERN. BY KERN I'D JONES JONES NO ALAN AND ALAN ARE LIKE OF EURO I CAN BE A REAL AYE HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON HI JACKSON ARE AYE MONNING AYE MONNING HI. FIVE ONE- BUT ON CALL OKAY WELL THAT MEASURES BEING LEFT ON CALL AT FIVE ONE AND FOR A FINAL BILL WE HAVE A CENTER ALLEN MISS BE THIRTEEN EIGHTY. YOU ARE A THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MEMBERS I'VE I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL- EVEN THOUGH WE STILL OWE YOU A DEFINITION ON ENCROACHMENT- WE GLADLY ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. SO THIS BILL SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY SIX TO SAVE THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY VALUABLE TIME AND RESOURCES BY ALLOWING THE CONSERVANCY THE RIGHT TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS ENCROACHMENT ISSUES AND LANA GLACIATIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO JUST TO EXPLAIN TO FOLKS- S. IN AND SEE THE SENATE AMOUNTS CONSERVANCY FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED ENCROACHMENTS ONTO ITS LAND. ALTHOUGH THESE ARE TYPICALLY MINOR ENERGY SENT LANDOWNER BUILT A DRIVEWAY OR SWIMMING POOL ON CONSERVANCY LAND FOR EXAMPLE- THE CONSERVANCY BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT RULES. IS REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH A COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING STATE PROCESS TO TRANSFER THAT LAND TO THE LANDOWNER IN EXCHANGE FOR ANOTHER PARCEL OR WHICH IS OFTEN. YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PROCESS IS OFTEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE THAN THE LAND PARCELS WORTH SO- SINCE THE CONSERVANCY'S LAND IS STATE OWNED. ANY ACQUISITION OR DISPOSAL ITS LAND IS SUBJECT TO THE STATE'S PROPERTY ACQUISITION LAW. AND THEREFORE REQUIRES WORKING THROUGH THE STATE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD AND APART A GENTLE SERVICES TO SELL TRANSFER OR EXCHANGE INTERESTS IN REAL PROPERTY THAT'S ALL VERY GOOD AND IMPORTANT- BUT- FOR REASONS THAT I THINK YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE EXPLAINED I WILL TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT WE'VE WE'VE GIVEN SOME LEVEL FLEXIBILITY TO. CONSERVANCY'S BASICALLY THIS BILL PUTS I THE SAME AMOUNTS CONSERVANCY. INTO A PLACE OF GENERAL PARITY WITH THE CONSERVANCY'S IN GIVING FLEXIBILITY- YET TO ALLOW THE STAFF OF THE CONSERVANCY TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS DISTRESS TO ADDRESS- ENCOURAGEMENTS IF THE VALUE OF SUCH PROPERTY INTERESTS IS LESS THAN HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. THE TAHOE CONSERVANCY FOR EXAMPLE. AS A THIRTY TO ACQUIRE. OUR PROPERTY VALUE TO UNDER FIVE IN A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. I FOR EXAMPLE SO- ANYHOW AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS AMENDMENTS NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL. I TO ONLY ADDRESS THE CONSERVANCY'S ABILITY TO ACQUIRE LAND FROM THE WILLING SELLER WHO HAS ENCROACHED. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CONSERVANCY AND TGS. ON LANGUAGE TO COVER EFFICIENTLY TRANSFERRING THECAN SERVICES LAND THAT HAS BEEN BUILT UPON. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK OF THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS INSTANCES IN WHICH A LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCY OR UTILITY REQUEST THE LAND TRANSFER. FIRST OF ALL OUR RIGHT OF WAY. NOW WITH THESE REMAINING ISSUES WORKED OUT THE BILL. WILL ENABLE CONSERVANCY ULTIMATELY TO FIGHT MORE EFFECTIVELY TO FILL ITS MISSION OF PROTECTING PUBLIC LANDS- PROVIDING RECORD IT RECREATIONAL. OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS CERTAINLY THOSE IN- YEARS OF MY DISTRICT MISTER CHAIR- WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THE BILL AB JEFF MALONEY USE CHIEF. STAFF COUNSEL SMM CNA I KNOW I KNOW THE NOW STOCK LIMIT.

SPECIAL THANKS TO SENATOR ALLEN FOR LEADING THE CHARGE IN PROPOSALS LEGISLATION- CENTER ALLEN COVERED A LOT OF MY COMMENTS BUT JUST SHOULD JUST WALK THROUGH THE CONSERVANCY THE STATE AGENCY. AND THE MINISTRATION HASN'T YET WEIGHED IN ON THIS MATTER SO WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION TAKERS FOR MOLD- SUPPORTER OF OPPOSED.

YOU'RE IN THE BILL AND NOW THE BILL PROVIDE THE CONSERVANCY WITH ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO ADDRESS THE RECURRING PROBLEM. TO THE CONCORD TRENDS. LAN THANK QUESTIONS INCLUDE EVERYTHING FROM SMALL BASED GARDENS TENNIS. TO EVEN ON. BILL SUCH IN COURTROOMS ARE REALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR US FOR VARIOUS REASONS INCLUDING. THE OBVIOUS DAMAGE TO THE NATURAL HABITAT WHICH IS OUR MISSION TO PROTECT. INCREASED BY. STATE OR WHATEVER IMPROVEMENTS ARE THERE AND JUST OVERALL DIFFICULT TRICK DIFFICULTY. IN MONITORING LANDS UNDER STATE OWNERSHIP OUR NEW SITUATIONS ARISE. IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND IS OUR WAY TO ADDRESS THE COURT WILL BE TO CONVEY TITLE TO THE AFFECTED AREA TO BE CHANGED. OWNER IN EXCHANGE FOR TILE TO OTHER PROPERTY OWNED BY A COLLECTION PART ABOUT THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO BUT SOMETIMES THE BEST THING WE- THIS. SO THE TRANSACTION AND ALLOW US TO. AND MORE CHRISTIAN THE ADDRESSES. CURRENTLY AS YOU HEARD WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE- PUBLIC WORKS FOR AN APPROPRIATE PROPERTY ACQUISITION LAW AND MOST THE TIME THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR LARGER ACCUSATIONS OF COURSE. WHY WOULD THAT BE THESE ARE TYPICALLY SMALLER PIECE OF PROPERTY AND THE B. B. PROCESS CAN OFTEN SERVE AS A DISINCENTIVE TO OUR AGENCY AND A PRIVATE PARTIES TO RESOLVE THIS WELL HERE'S WHAT THE EXPENSE AND THE TIME- THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION WOULD FACILITATED DESTINATION PRIVATE LAND THAT WOULD ALLOW THE CONSERVANCY TO FIND CREATIVE SOLUTION TO ENCOURAGEMENT. AND TIME AND TIME AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER SO ARE WE DON'T IT OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO MORE EFFICIENTLY MANAGER PROPERTIES AND TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED PROTECTION OF CRITICAL OPEN SPACE AND HAVE A CHAT IN AROUND.
