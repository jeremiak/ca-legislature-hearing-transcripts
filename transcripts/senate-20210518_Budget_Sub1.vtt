NEXT PERSON IS CHASING CONSTANT.

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:52.705
TOURISTS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:54.740
PANEL SO. A GOOD MORNING CAN-

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:55.341
THERE'S A CONSTANT SLUDGE AND

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.776
OFFICE BEFORE I DIVE INTO THE

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.578
LIBRARY PROPOSALS I WANTED TO

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.447
TOUCH ON A THEME THAT YOU'LL

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:02.014
HEAR US REITERATE THROUGHOUT

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:03.583
THE HEARING TODAY. AND THAT IS

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:04.684
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.619
SUBMITTED A LOT OF PROPOSALS

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:07.653
COVERING MANY DIFFERENT

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.222
PRIORITIES AND ACROSS MANY

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:11.490
DIFFERENT AGENCIES. I MEAN A

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:12.758
LOT OF CASES THESE PROPOSALS

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.861
HAVE VERY LIMITED INFORMATION

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:16.262
AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS VERY

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.865
LITTLE TIME TO ASSESS THEM

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:19.298
BASED ON THIS LITTLE

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:20.933
INFORMATION. AND THEN EVEN

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.301
WHERE INFORMATION DOES EXIST

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:24.670
FOR THESE PROPOSALS- IT'S

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:26.572
OFTEN- PRELIMINARY OR

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:30.576
INCOMPLETE. DESPITE THAT A LACK

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:32.278
OF INFORMATION WE THINK THERE

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.113
ARE PROPOSALS WHERE THE

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.115
LEGISLATURE COULD START MAKING

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.517
DECISIONS ON THESE PROPOSALS-

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:40.386
EITHER THE PROPOSALS HAVE

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:42.822
MERITS AND ARE WORTHY OF

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:43.522
CONSIDERATION IN THIS YEAR'S

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.524
BUDGET. WELL THEY RAISE ISSUES

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.627
FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.495
LEGISLATURE ONE AWAY. OR THE

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:51.230
PROPOSALS ARE PROBLEMATIC

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:52.431
PROBLEMATIC ENOUGH THAT YOU

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:54.800
COULD REJECT THEM WITHOUT-

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:55.401
NECESSARILY GETTING MUCH MORE

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.603
INFORMATION. AND THEN THERE ARE

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.106
PRPOSALS WHERE- THAT PROPOSALS

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:02.074
AND CONCEPTS SEEM REASONABLE

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:02.942
BUT THERE IS SOME INFORMATION

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:05.411
LACKING- AT THE LEGISLATURE

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:07.246
WOULD WANT TO GET MORE

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:10.016
INFORMATION BEFORE AUTHORIZING-

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:12.084
AND IN THIS PARTICULAR- LIBRARY

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:14.720
ITEM WE THINK THAT YOU SEE OLD

00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:15.354
ALL OF THESE KINDS OF PROPOSALS

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:18.224
HERE. I JUST WALK THROUGH A FEW

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.393
OF THE MAJOR ONES. ARE MY

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:21.327
DIRECTOR TENSION TO THE VERY

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.929
FIRST BULLET ON LIBRARY

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:24.263
INFRASTRUCTURE ON PAGE TWO OF

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.999
YOUR AGENDA. ON A LIBRARIAN FOR

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.734
STRUCTURE IS SOMETHING THAT

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.202
THIS COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:31.570
IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS IT'S

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:32.471
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:35.775
IDENTIFIED AS A- CONSIDERATION-

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:37.410
FOR THE SENATE'S BUDGET. SO

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:39.312
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THE

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:40.746
COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:42.114
THE WE THINK THEY HAVE

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:42.982
GOVERNORS MAY REVISION

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:45.418
PROPOSAL- PROVIDES A

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.019
POTENTIALLY GOOD STARTING POINT

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.522
TO WORK FROM. THAT SAID WE DO

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:50.389
HAVE SOME RECOMMENDED

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:51.791
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS IF THAT'S

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:53.225
AN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:56.028
TO PURSUE. FOR EXAMPLE WE

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:58.130
RECOMMEND LIMITING THE SCOPE OF

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:01.400
THIS- PROPOSAL TO- CAPITAL

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:03.035
OUTLAY AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:04.704
ANOTHER FACILITY RATED RELATED

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.672
INFRASTRUCTURE. AS YOU CAN SEE

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:07.940
THERE ARE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:10.209
RELATED PROPOSALS- FOCUSED ON

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.211
BROADBAND ACCESS AND WE'D

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.346
ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:15.281
ENSURE THAT- THERE'S NO

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:16.949
DUPLICATION AMONG ITS DIFFERENT

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:20.286
GRANT PROGRAMS. WELL I THINK

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.988
THERE ARE SOME PROPOSALS HERE

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:22.755
THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:25.491
REJECTING- FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:26.592
LOOK UNDER THAT SUB HEADING

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.694
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING. THE

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.230
FIRST TWO PROPOSALS ENGLISH AS

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:31.831
A SECOND LANGUAGE IN AN ONLINE

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:33.899
TUTORING. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:34.433
THAT THESE ARE SUPPORTING

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.269
ACTIVITIES THAT- SCHOOLS AND

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:39.538
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ALREADY

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:40.940
COVER THE STATE PROVIDING

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:41.741
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THESE

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:43.676
PURPOSES- WE DON'T SEE THE

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.111
RATIONALE IN CREATING A

00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:47.013
SEPARATE PROGRAMS FOCUSED- ON

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:49.215
LIBRARIES- LARGELY DUPLICATING

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:51.884
THE SERVICES WE RECOMMEND YOU

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:55.388
REJECT THESE ONES. AND THEN

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:55.921
FINALLY WE THINK THERE ARE

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:59.425
PROPOSALS THAT- SEEM-

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.793
POTENTIALLY REASONABLE CONCEPT

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.194
THERE'S JUST- NOT A LOT OF

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:03.062
INFORMATION ON THEM AT THIS

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:05.765
TIME. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.166
YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF US SMALLER

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:08.200
INITIATIVES OR WE THINK THIS IS

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:10.269
THE CASE. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE A

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.238
LOT OF THESE PROPOSALS- AT

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:14.440

AND ALSO WALKING THROUGH WHAT

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:27.053
ALTERNATIVES WERE CONSIDERED IT

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.988
FOR EXAMPLE- WHY EXISTING STAFF

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:30.689
CANNOT ABSORB THESE ACTIVITIES

00:11:30.756 --> 00:11:32.191
WE RECOMMEND- GETTING MORE

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:32.925
INFORMATION FROM THE

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:33.759

THE BEST TO TAKE A SHOT AT IT.

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.118

IS LEFT IN THE BUDGET EXACTLY

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:56.775
THE WAY THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:12:56.842 --> 00:13:00.913
PROPOSED. SO GREAT BREAKING THE

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.048
TWO ITEMS RIGHT SO THAT THERE'S

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:05.684
A THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR.

00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:06.485
GRANT PROGRAM INVOLVING

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:08.420
BROADBAND FOCUSING ON THE

FACILITY'S FIRST THE INTENT OF

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:12.291
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TO GIVE

VARIETY OF DETERMINERS BUT A

00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:30.643
KEY YARDSTICK. MAYBE I'M OUT OF

SO THE LEAST RESOURCE LIBRARIES

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.166
RIGHT WOULD BE GET FIRST CALL

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:55.401
ON THAT MONEY AND THAT'S

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:57.369

A 0% MATCH IS THAT GOINGTO BE

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:14.220
SOMETHING THAT SCREAMS PEOPLE

OUT BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO GO

00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:16.956
TO THE WASTE RESOURCE AND THEN

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:20.192
THEY DON'T HAVE THE 50% MATCH.

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:23.696
WELL WELL. I MEAN. YEAH THAT'S

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:24.897

THE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:32.438
HOWEVER I MEAN THIS PROPOSAL

00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:35.641
HAS- WALKING GIVES US THE

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:38.310
ABILITY. TO REDUCE RIGHT THE

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:41.547
AMOUNT OF- MATCHING FUNDS THAT

00:14:41.614 --> 00:14:44.383
SHOULD BE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE

INTO THE WEEDS. A LOT OF TIMES

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:51.257
WHEN THEY'RE THAT SMALL AND

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:52.825
THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH CAPACITY

00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:54.059
THEY DON'T HAVE EXTENSIVE

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.361
CAPACITY TO COMPLETE

GENERALLY SPEAKING SENATOR-

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:30.449
THERE'S SO MUCH DIVERSITY IN

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:33.018
CALIFORNIA THERE'S SO MANY

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:35.621
DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND FAMILIES

00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:36.488
AND SO MANY DIFFERENT

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:39.858
SITUATIONS THAT BEARS MULTIPLE

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:42.194
PATHS TO SUCCESS AND I THINK

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:42.961
PART OF GOVERNMENT'S

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:46.565
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO CREATE. AS

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.334
MANY PATHS SO TO THAT SUCCESS

00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:53.138
RIGHT THE FACILITATE- YOU KNOW

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:55.441
THE DESIRES AND THE GOALS OF%

00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:57.543
INDIVIDUAL CALIFORNIANS SO THE

00:17:57.609 --> 00:18:00.179
EXPERIENCE THAT'S GOING ON IN

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.246
SO THEY'VE BEEN LITERACY

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:03.916
PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA LIBRARY

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:06.351
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. AND

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:09.154
SO THIS PROPOSAL ADDS ENGLISH

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:11.123
AS A SECOND LANGUAGE TO ONE OF

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.659
THE ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.928
THESE LOCAL LITERACY PROGRAMS

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:18.163
AND THE REASON THE PROPOSAL IS

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.733
HERE IS BECAUSE ONE- THE STATE

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.404
IS SPENDING ABOUT 50% LESS IN

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.473
ADULT EDUCATION AND WAS. YOU

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:28.707
KNOW EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AGO

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.576
WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN TOOK

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:36.181

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.322
AND ALSO THERE'S PEOPLE WHO

00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:46.091
DON'T- SIXTY DOES WELL IN A

00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:48.794
CLASSROOM AND FIRE. AND SO WHAT

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:52.598
WE HAVE REPORTED TO US BY. YOUR

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:55.067

VARIETY OF PROPOSALS- ROUNDS

00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:26.732
AROUND TUTORING I SUPPOSE- I

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:27.633

WHICH THE CORONA VIRUS A

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.730
PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED THE

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:07.699
DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THIS STATE-

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.334
AND I GUESS I'M JUST NOT I'M

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:11.903
NOT KNOWING. YOU KNOW WHAT THE

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.538
EXISTING ARCHITECTURE LOOKS

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:14.973
LIKE WHAT IS THIRTY FIVE

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.776
MILLION DOLLARS GET US AND TO

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:19.811
THE LIBRARY DO YOU DO YOU MAYBE

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:21.046
YOU COULD COMMENT ON HOW YOU

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:24.449
SEE THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES AND

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:25.784
ADDRESSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.

00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:26.685
YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR I'M

HAPPY TO. THE THIRTY FIVE

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:32.658
MILLION IS EIGHTY. EIGHT PILOTS

00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:35.694
TO INVESTIGATE A STRATEGY THAT

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:37.729
WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS WITH

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:40.132
OVER THE PAST YEAR. IN WORKING

00:21:40.198 --> 00:21:42.801
WITH. K. THROUGH TWELVE OUR

00:21:42.868 --> 00:21:44.936
COUNTERPARTS IN THROUGH TWELVE

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:47.506
EDUCATION SO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:50.142
OFFERS A DISCOUNT RIGHT IT'S

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:52.077
CALLED THE E. RATE DISCOUNT AND

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:54.312
SO IF YOUR OLD LIBRARY YOU'RE

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:55.781
TRYING TO CONNECT YOU GET ANY

00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:58.350
RATE DISCOUNT. IF YOUR SCHOOL

00:21:58.417 --> 00:21:59.985
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO CONNECT

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:02.087
YOU GET ANY RATE JUST. SO WE

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:05.023
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT IF WE

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.292
FIND A LIBRARY TO CONNECT. AND

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:09.428
THE SCHOOL TO CONNECT AND BUILD

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:12.431
THE PROJECTS AT THE SAME TIME.

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:14.332
THOSE TWO DISCOUNTS HAVE BEEN

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:17.569
SUFFICIENT. TO GET BIDDERS TO

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:21.073
AGREED TO SET TO DO PROJECTS TO

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:23.175
CONNECT PLACES. THAT DIDN'T

00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:25.210
PENCIL OUT FOR THEM PREVIOUSLY.

00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:27.112
SO THIS THIRTY FIVE MILLION

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.347
CHANGE THAT STRATEGY RIGHT SO

00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:30.816
THAT I CAN TELL YOU SOME OF THE

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:31.717
PLACES THAT YOU WANT THAT

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:33.552
WE'VE- COLLECTED USING THAT

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:36.188
APPROACH LAST YEAR. SO THIS

00:22:36.254 --> 00:22:39.024
PROPOSAL TAKES THAT STRATEGY

00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:41.526
AND ENHANCED TELEHEALTH TO IT

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.161
WHICH IS ALSO AN ADDITIONAL E.

00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:45.130
RATE DISCOUNT. SO IN OTHER

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:48.233
WORDS IF WE'RE ABLE TO CONNECT

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.534
PROJECTS THAT WEREN'T PENCILING

00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:51.603
OUT PREVIOUSLY BY DOING

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.005
LIBRARIES PLUS SCHOOLS. THIS

00:22:54.072 --> 00:22:55.741
PROPOSAL AS LIBRARIES PLUS

00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:57.943
SCHOOLS PLUS TELESALES. AND

00:22:58.009 --> 00:22:59.644
THEN THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER

00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:00.879
THERE'S ANOTHER POT OF MONEY

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:03.148
HERE ONE TIME MONEY IN A

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:05.150
LIBRARY BUDGET. BUT WE'VE BEEN

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:08.420
USING IT TO MAKE A MATCH RIGHT

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:09.121
TO THAT SO THE FEDERAL

00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:11.389
GOVERNMENT SAYS. IT IN ESSENCE

00:23:11.456 --> 00:23:12.724
FOR EVERYBODY YOU PUT IN WILL

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:15.627
GIVE YOU A CHANCE. SO WE ALSO

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:17.662
MAKE A MATCHING FUND LIKE WRITE

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:20.465
THE CHECK AND ALSO REDUCE THE

00:23:20.532 --> 00:23:25.637
COST OF. CONSTRUCTION AND- SO

00:23:25.704 --> 00:23:26.238
THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT GROUP

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:29.508
DOES IS. A STRATEGY TO FIND

THAT KIND OF PRIVATE SECTOR. OF

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:35.914
WHICH THERE ARE NUMBERS THAT

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:37.115
WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY DETERMINED

00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:38.850
THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME TO

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:40.152
FOLLOW UP BEFORE WE GET TO LA-

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:41.853
I GUESS I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.221
UNCLEAR STILL FROM YOUR

00:23:43.288 --> 00:23:45.724
DESCRIPTION AND FROM- THAT THAT

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:47.793
PAPER THAT WE RECEIVED. WHAT

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:48.860
DOES THAT MEAN IS I MEAN YOU'RE

00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:50.195
OUTFITTING THE LIBRARIES

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:51.763
THEMSELVES USING SUB DIFFERENT

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.632
SUBSIDY PROGRAMS LIBRARIES

FOLLOW UP IS ONE OF THIRTY FIVE

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.881
MILLION DOLLARS TO GET US ON A

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:11.349
PILOT PROGRAM IS AT ONE LIBRARY

00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:13.485
IT TOTALLY OUTFITTED ISN'T. AND

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:14.352
YOU KNOW HOW I WOULD TO WHAT

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:18.056
DEGREE. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:19.191
EXPANDING INTERNET ACCESS- I

00:24:19.257 --> 00:24:20.492
CAN TAKE A CUT OF THAT UNLESS

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:24.162
YOU UNLESS YOU WANT TO J. SOME-

00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:27.098
IT'S NOT ONE LIBRARY IT'SSMALL

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:29.201
IT'S INVASION DAY AS BEING YOU

00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:30.936
KNOW MULTIPLE PROJECTS HOW MANY

00:24:31.002 --> 00:24:34.706
I CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU. SO FOR

00:24:34.773 --> 00:24:38.009
THE PAST SEVEN YEARS- LIBRARIES

00:24:38.076 --> 00:24:40.111
HAVE BEEN CONNECTING WE'VE BEEN

00:24:40.178 --> 00:24:42.013
HELPING LIBRARIES CONNECT TO. A

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.249
BROADBAND NETWORK THAT THE

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:45.617
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS

00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:48.086
PART OF C. S. U. THE COMMUNITY

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:50.288
COLLEGES AND K. THROUGH TWELVE

00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:53.692
SCHOOLS. AND SO PART OF THE

00:24:53.758 --> 00:24:55.560
PROCESS OF CONNECTING TO THIS

00:24:55.627 --> 00:25:00.232
BROADBAND NETWORK IS EXTENDING

00:25:00.298 --> 00:25:00.799
BROADBAND PLACES THAT DON'T

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:02.167
HAVE. SO THIS THIRTY FIVE

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:04.769
MILLION TO HELPS RIGHT SO IT'S

00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:08.707
CONNECT. AT LEAST TO THIS

00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:10.909
BROADBAND NETWORK MIKE OKAY

00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:12.377
YEAH THAT THAT IS THAT HELPING

00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:14.179
FAMILY CONNECTING LIBRARIES

00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:15.680
THEMSELVES THE EXISTING NETWORK

00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:18.049
I GOT PRECISELY RIGHT LIBRARIES

00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:20.719
PLUS SCHOOLS AND THEN OFFERING

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:21.586
AND THEN A TELEHEALTH

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:22.988
CONNECTION AS WELL AS WHAT THE

00:25:23.054 --> 00:25:26.958
INTENT OF THIS PILOT PROJECT.

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:28.226
WITH WITH AN IDEA WHAT THEY

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:30.662
MEAN THE IDEA BEING THAT WITH

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:32.597
THESE MULTIPLE DISK TAKING

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:33.798
ADVANTAGE OF THESE MULTIPLE

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:36.201
DISCOUNTS HARDER TO CONNECT

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:38.270
PLACES IN THE STATE WHAT THE

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:40.705
HELL WILL HAVE A GREATER

00:25:40.772 --> 00:25:42.240
LIKELIHOOD OF BEING. AND IT'S

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:44.409
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE I SAY IT'S A

00:25:44.476 --> 00:25:46.244
IT'S A THREE FOR TWO RIGHT.

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:49.114
CANADA ASCEND REMAIN THAT- OKAY

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.582
HE'S GOOD I THINK I'M GOOD-

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:53.418
ALTHOUGH LA- HAS ANY COMMENTS

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:53.985
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:58.189
THOSE. ASHURA I'LL TAKE A STAB

00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:01.559
SO- MAYBE JUST TO REITERATE A

00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:03.428
FEW POINTS GREG MADE-

00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:05.563
HISTORICALLY LIBRARIES WERE IN

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.399
CALIFORNIA WERE RESPONSIBLE

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:10.201
FOR- DEVELOPING THEIR OWN

00:26:10.268 --> 00:26:11.469
CONNECTIONS TO THE INTERNET BUT

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:13.004
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE STATE

00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:14.940
BEGAN AN INITIATIVE TO CONNECT

00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:16.141
LIBRARIES TO THE STATE'S

00:26:16.207 --> 00:26:18.743
EXISTING- INTERNET SYSTEM FOR

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.512
EDUCATION AGENCIES THAT SYSTEM

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:22.414
INCLUDES HIGHER READING K.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.182
TWELVE AND IT'S OVERSEEN BY AN

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:27.152
ENTITY CALLED SCENIC- AND

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:28.186
SUPPORTING THIS INITIATIVE

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:29.487
THERE'S SOME ONGOING COSTS

00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:30.422
INCLUDING IN THIS YEAR'S

00:26:30.488 --> 00:26:32.724
BUDGET- TO PAY FOR THE CONTRACT

00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:33.892
TO SCENIC. BUT THERE'S ALSO

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:36.161
SOME OTHER STATE IN PREVIOUS

00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:37.095
YEARS AS PROVIDED SOMEONE TIME

CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET AND

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:43.068
ALSO FOR LIBRARIES THAT ARE

00:26:43.134 --> 00:26:44.436
CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET TO

00:26:44.502 --> 00:26:45.804
EXPAND THEIR- BROADBAND

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.707
CAPACITY. IN YOUR AGENDA THERE

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:50.175
ARE TWO DIFFERENT GRANT

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:52.544
PROGRAMS THERE'S- THE THIRTY

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.679
FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ONE AND IN

00:26:54.746 --> 00:26:55.914
THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR ONE. OUR

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:57.082
UNDERSTANDING IS THE SIX

00:26:57.148 --> 00:27:00.051
MILLION DOLLAR ONE IS- A BIT

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:02.287
MORE TYPICAL OF THE PREVIOUS

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:03.621
GRANTS THAT WERE PROVIDED IS

00:27:03.688 --> 00:27:05.290
FOCUSED ON. CONNECTING

00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:06.791
LIBRARIES TO THIS MORE MORE

00:27:06.858 --> 00:27:07.993
LIBRARIES OF THE SYSTEM AND

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:09.160
THEN EXPAND FOR LIBRARIES ARE

00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:10.628
CONNECTED IN. CONNECTING TO

00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:11.629
EXPANDING THEIR BROADBAND

00:27:11.696 --> 00:27:13.531
ACCESS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:15.500
THAT MOST LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:17.135
ARE CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM BUT

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:18.503
NOT ALL BRANCHES BRANCH

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.305
LIBRARIES ARE SO- THAT WOULD BE

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:21.806
SORT OF THE FOCUS IS GETTING

00:27:21.873 --> 00:27:22.340
THOSE REMAINING BRANCHES

00:27:22.407 --> 00:27:24.109
CONNECTED. AND THEN ALSO

00:27:24.175 --> 00:27:25.176
SIMILARLY FOR SOME

00:27:25.243 --> 00:27:27.312
JURISDICTIONS EXPANDING THEIR

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:29.280
BROADBAND CAPACITY. HELLO ON

00:27:29.347 --> 00:27:30.615
THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE

00:27:30.682 --> 00:27:32.484
WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT- IN

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.718
YOUR YOUR GENDER I THINK

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:34.352
DESCRIBE THIS LATER BUT THERE'S

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:36.454
SOME. ADDITIONAL UNSPENT

00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:38.189
FUNDING FROM PREVIOUS GRANT

00:27:38.256 --> 00:27:38.957
AWARDS IT'S ONE POINT THREE

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:40.692
MILLION- IT WOULD BE REALLY

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:41.626
APPROPRIATE IN THIS YEAR'S

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:43.428
BUDGET WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:45.630
ADOPT THE REAPPROPRIATION- BUT

00:27:45.697 --> 00:27:46.931
THAT YOU GET MORE CLARITY AS

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:50.268
TO- WHAT THEY- REMAINING NEED

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.804
IS AND WHETHER- IN ALL THE SIX

00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:53.671
MILLION TO BE SPENT IN THIS

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:55.974
YEAR OR- THAT NEED TO BE

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:56.775
ADDRESSED THIS YEAR WITH THE

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:58.243
REAPPROPRIATION AND- REDUCING

00:27:58.309 --> 00:27:59.744
THIS ONCE THOSE UNSPENT FUNDS

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:01.880
ARE FULLY SPENT DOWN. ON THE

00:28:01.946 --> 00:28:02.447
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:04.382
PROPOSAL- I UNDERSTANDING IS IT

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:06.684
IS THIS IS A SOMEWHAT NEWER

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:08.987
INITIATIVE THAT'S INTENDED TO.

00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:10.688
FURTHER EXPAND INTERNET ACCESS

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:13.224
THROUGH. COLLABORATIVE SPAM

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:16.694
WITH SCHOOLS IN TELE HEALTH

00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:17.729
AGENCIES. AND HERE WE JUST HAVE

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:19.264
A LOT MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.232
PROPOSAL- IT'S A LITTLE

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:22.400
UNCERTAINTY LAST HOW MANY

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:24.269
CLAPPERS WITH THIS WITH SUPPORT

00:28:24.335 --> 00:28:25.770
IT'S ON. CERTAIN TO US HOW MUCH

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:28.773
MORE FEDERAL E. RATE WOULD BE-

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.374
DRAWN DOWN AS A RESULT OF THE

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:31.042
PROPOSAL. I MEAN IT'S ALSO

00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:33.144
INCLUDING LAST- WHAT THE STATE

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:34.612
FUNDS WOULD SPECIFICALLY COVER

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:36.981
AND- BY THIS FUNDING IS NEEDED

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:39.751
RIGHT WHY THESE AGENCIES- CAN'T

00:28:39.818 --> 00:28:40.518
FIND THESE ACTIVITIES FROM

00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:41.853
THEIR OPERATIONS. THIS IS ONE

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.954
OF THOSE PROPOSALS WERE STILL

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:44.122
WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

00:28:44.189 --> 00:28:45.123
ON BUT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:49.527

ITEM. SECOND CHECK IN PRIOR

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:18.623
HEARINGS WE TALKED ABOUT MAYBE

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.824
NET YEAR LOOKING AT THE

REVIEW IT SINCE IT'S BEEN A

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:28.032
NUMBER OF DECADES THAT IS JUST

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:31.102
CHANGE BIT BY BIT HANFORD. THE

B. T. ARCHIVES CAME UP AND I

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.481
SUPPORT ADDING THAT. THERE WAS

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:45.917
A CONCERN EXPRESSED SINCE THEN

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:46.651
THAT THERE SHOULD BE A BROADER

CATCH UP IN ON WANTED NEEDED

00:29:56.394 --> 00:29:59.297
MAYBE NEXT YEAR. WE CAN LOOK AT

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:00.698
A DIFFERENT GROUPS DIFFERENT

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:02.780
PROGRAM. LASTLY AND THIS IS A

00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:05.516
BIG BIG PROPOSAL THAT AFFECTS

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:07.385
ALL SEGMENTS BUT IT DOES SHOW

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:09.387
UP IN UC'S BUDGET SPECIFICALLY.

00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:10.988
THAT'S WERE PROPOSING ONE

00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:14.025
BILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND

00:38:14.091 --> 00:38:17.795
SPLIT BETWEEN BUDGET HERE AT

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:18.763
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO FIVE

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.464
HUNDRED MILLION IN BUDGET YEAR

00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:21.899
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN TWENTY

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:23.200
TWO TWENTY THREE. THAT WOULD BE

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:25.102
TO ESTABLISH LEARNING ALIGNED

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:27.371
EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM. TO PROVIDE

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:29.340
LEARNING ALIGNED LONG TERM

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:31.976
CAREER DEVELOPMENT FOR UC CSU

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:33.844
AND CCC STUDENTS. SO THE WAY

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:37.181
THIS WOULD WORK IS THE BILLION.

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:38.149
ONE TIME GENERAL FUND WOULD

00:38:38.215 --> 00:38:39.417
CREATE AN ENDOWMENT

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:42.253
ADMINISTERED BY THE UC. BASED

00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:44.655
ON THE PROPORTION OF PELL

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:45.923
ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AT EACH

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.526
SEGMENT YOU SEE WOULD ALLOCATE

00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:50.127
THE ANNUAL RETURNS FROM THE AN

00:38:50.194 --> 00:38:53.364
ENDOWMENT. AND THEN DOT FUNDING

00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:55.499
WOULD SUPPORT A STATE FUNDED

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:57.935
WORK STUDY PROGRAM. KNOW THAT

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.670
THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT STATE

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:01.872
FUNDED WORK STUDY PROGRAM WHICH

00:39:01.939 --> 00:39:04.775
WOULD BE R. EIGHT A STUDENT

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:05.309
WITH FINDING DEMONSTRATED

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:08.212
FINANCIAL NEED. THAT ISN'T FROM

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:10.314
AN UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUND.

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:11.549
AND WE'RE ALSO PRIORITIZING

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:15.753
STEM MAJORS IN STEM EMPLOYERS

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.422
WITH THAT- WE HAVE THE TRAILER

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:19.490
BILLING WHICH ASSOCIATE WITH

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:21.292
THAT AS WELL SO WITH THAT ALL

00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:22.793
ALL SAY WE ARE AVAILABLE FOR

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.729
QUESTIONS WE LOOK FORWARD TO

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:28.299
THE DISK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:39:28.365 --> 00:39:28.899
NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:34.105
LA- SO I THINK IT'LL BE HELPFUL

00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:35.940
TO THEM I WORK FROM PAGE SEVEN

00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:39.543
OF YOUR AGENDA. THIS PAGE SHOWS

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:41.712
A TABLE SUMMARIZING ALL OF THE

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:44.849
GENERAL FUND- PROPOSALS THAT

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:47.017
YOU SEE- IT SHOWS NO PROPOSALS

00:39:47.084 --> 00:39:48.686
THAT WERE AND GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:39:48.753 --> 00:39:50.187
BACK IN JANUARY. ON THE

00:39:50.254 --> 00:39:52.656
PROPOSALS NOW UNDER MAYOR

00:39:52.723 --> 00:39:53.190
VISION AND THE DIFFERENCE

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:55.059
BETWEEN THE TWO- AND I WOULD

00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:57.261
JUST NOTE IT'S ALL GENERAL FUND

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:59.296
THERE IS A AN ADDITIONAL AT THE

00:39:59.363 --> 00:40:00.498
MOMENT AS HE ADMINISTRATION

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:02.066
NOTED ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:02.600
FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDING FOR

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:04.335
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- THAT

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:06.437
SADDAM. IS IMPORTANT BUT NOT B.

00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:08.606
B. THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:10.107
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IMAGINE

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:13.210
pDAUNTING TO WORK THROUGH I CAN

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:14.044
THINK OF TIME I WON'T GO

00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:15.813
THROUGH EVERY SINGLE PROPOSAL.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.548
I'LL JUST TOUCH ON FOUR KEY

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:19.917
ISSUES- THAT THE COMMITTEE IS

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:22.386
FACING RIGHT NOW. THE FIRST

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:24.822
ISSUE I WILL HIGHLIGHT IS BASED

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:27.158
IN PART FOR YOU SEE. AND THAT

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:28.125
IS REALLY SUMMARIZED IN THOSE

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:31.028
FIRST TWO ITEMS UNDER THE ON

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.997
GOING. THAT'S THE THREE OH TWO

00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:34.965
MILLION OR ON RESTORATION FUNDS

00:40:35.032 --> 00:40:38.202
TO GET YOU SEE BACK TO ITS-

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:39.069
PREVIOUS LEVEL SUPPORT PRE

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:40.404
PANDEMIC. AND THEN AN

00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:41.906
ADDITIONAL BASE INCREASE UNDER

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:43.340
THE MAY REVISION IT THE

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:46.477
ADMINISTRATION'S INCREASING THE

00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:48.779
BASE INCREASE FROM 3% 25% WELL

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:50.014
WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE FOR

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.549
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTEMPLATE

00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:53.818
PROVIDING. A BASE INCREASES TO

00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:56.687
UC EVEN ABOVE RESTORATION FUNDS

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:57.788
YOU SEE DOES FACE COST

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:59.156
PRESSURES EACH YEAR AND THIS

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:01.525
YEAR CERTAINLY DIFFERENT- IN

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:02.560
TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:04.361
THAT BASING CREASE COULD BE WE

00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:05.830
THINK A REASONABLE PLACE TO

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:08.732
START- CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:11.502
BASE INCREASE IS- YOU SEIZE.

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:13.270
KEY OPERATING COSTS THINGS

00:41:13.337 --> 00:41:16.340
LIKE. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COST

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:18.776
INCREASES DEBT SERVICE. WHEN WE

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:20.444
SUM THAT UP IT GETS US TO A

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:21.712
LITTLE UNDER EIGHTY MILLION

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:23.981
DOLLARS OR A JUST OVER 2% BASED

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:25.916
INCREASE BUT THE LEGISLATURE

00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:26.717
COULD PREVENT CONSIDER

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:29.019
PROVIDING- LARGER BASE INCREASE

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:30.888
IN THAT FOR EXAMPLE BY ADOPTING

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:33.657
A 3% PROPOSED IN JANUARY OR THE

00:41:33.724 --> 00:41:35.826
5% PROPOSED IN THE REVISION. BY

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:37.862
DOING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:39.196
IT WOULD BE FINDING ADDITIONAL

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:41.332
YOU SEE PRIORITIES LIKE

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:43.300
EMPLOYEE SALARY INCREASES

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:44.768
STUDENT SUCCESS INITIATIVES OR

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:47.471
ENHANCING STUDENTS CERTAIN

00:41:47.538 --> 00:41:49.173
STUDENT SERVICES. THAT SAID A

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.408
YOU SEE WOULD HAVE FLEXIBILITY

00:41:51.475 --> 00:41:52.176
TO WAIVE THESE DIFFERENT

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:53.644
PRIORITIES WITH AN UNRESTRICTED

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:54.245
BASE INCREASE OF THE

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:56.447
LEGISLATURE. WANTS TO ENSURE

00:41:56.513 --> 00:41:57.615
THAT YOU SEE IS FUNDING SOME OF

00:41:57.681 --> 00:42:00.351
THESE PRIORITIES WE RECOMMEND

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:00.885
IT SPECIFY THAT IN THE END

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:04.188
BUDGET ACTS. THE SECOND ISSUE I

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:05.723
WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THAT VERY

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:07.825
FIRST ONE TIME PROPOSAL IN OUR

00:42:07.892 --> 00:42:09.159
TABLE IT SAYS FIVE HUNDRED

00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:10.861
MILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGET YEAR.

00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:11.996
THE PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE AN

00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:13.230
ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.798
DOLLARS IN THAT IN THERE. AND

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:16.834
THAT YOU'RE AFTER SO THIS WOULD

00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:18.535
BE A BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL.

00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:19.670
AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:42:19.737 --> 00:42:21.305
PROPOSING TO DO IS TO PROVIDE

00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:22.706
YOU SEE ONE TIME FUNDING TO

00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:24.541
CREATE AN ENDOWMENT THAT WOULD.

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:26.577
THEN SUPPORTS- EMPLOYMENT

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:28.946
OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS- THE

00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:32.082
SUPPORT WOULD COME FROM THE

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:32.583
ANNUAL EARNINGS FROM THE

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.151
ENDOWMENT. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:36.120
CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE

00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:37.121
HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE FUNDING%

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:39.590
APPROACH- INVESTING THE FUNDS

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:42.359
IN AND DOMINANCE- COULD

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:43.160
POTENTIALLY MEAN INVESTING THEM

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:44.695
IN EQUITIES. BUT THIS IS

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:45.763
UNUSUAL FOR STATE FUNDS

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:47.364
TYPICALLY THE STATE INVESTED

00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:49.900
FUNDS AND LOWER RISK-

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:53.504
SECURITIES LIKE GOVERNMENT-SECURITIES. ON SO THAT'S A CORE

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.571
ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:42:54.638 --> 00:42:55.806
CONSIDER IS SORT OF THE ADDED

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:59.243
RISK- FOR THESE PARTICULAR

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.145
STATE FUNDS. ALSO BY EXPOSING

00:43:01.211 --> 00:43:03.447
THE FUNDS TO EQUITIES- THE

00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:05.015
ANNUAL REVENUE COMING FROM THE

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.850
INDICTMENT. COULD BE VOLATILE

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:07.718
AND THAT COULD MAKE IT

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:09.753
DIFFICULT FOR CAMPUSES AND FOR

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.356
STUDENTS TO THE PLAN EACH YEAR.

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:13.724
THE PROPOSAL ALSO RAISES SOME

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:14.792
PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS IN OUR

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:17.795
MIND- IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE WHAT

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:19.496
THE ROLE OF THE STATE VERSUS

00:43:19.563 --> 00:43:21.966
EMPLOYERS WOULD BE AND I'M

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:23.767
PAYING FOR STUDENT STIPENDS.

00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:25.002
AND IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR HOW THIS

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:27.071
PROGRAM AND INTERACT WITH THE

00:43:27.137 --> 00:43:27.671
STATE'S EXISTING FINANCIAL AID

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:30.307
PROGRAMS. FOR ALL THESE REASONS

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:31.909
ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:35.713
RECOMMEND YOU REJECT IT. NOW

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.648
DOES THIRTY SHE WANNA COVER IS

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:38.816
ALL OF THE REMAINING ONE TIME

00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:40.351
PROPOSALS HERE AND YOU CAN SEE

00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:42.519
THAT THE MAY REVISION NOTABLY

00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:45.622
INCREASES THE NUMBER OF- ONE

00:43:45.689 --> 00:43:47.691
TIME PROPOSALS THAT YOU SEE.

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:49.693
SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS ARM WE

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.728
THINK OUR HIGH STREET

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:52.629
PRIORITIES AGAIN- YOU'VE HEARD

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:53.864
AS MENTIONED THIS MANY TIMES

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:55.432
BEFORE AND HEARINGS WE THINK

00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:57.701
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- IT HAS

00:43:57.768 --> 00:43:59.036
VERY CERTAIN BENEFITS TO THE

00:43:59.103 --> 00:44:00.604
STATE IT FUNDS PROJECTS THAT IF

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:01.605
THEY ARE OTHERWISE COVERED

00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:04.241
WITH. INCREASING COSTS IN

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:05.776
FUTURE YEARS. TO ADDRESSING

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:06.744
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE HELPS

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.846
ADDRESS BUDGET RESILIENCY BOTH

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:11.482
FOR YOU SEE AND FOR THE STATE.

00:44:11.548 --> 00:44:13.350
OTHER PROPOSALS COVER UP

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:15.919
PRIORITIES- THAT COULD BE OF

00:44:15.986 --> 00:44:17.621
INTEREST TO LEGISLATURE BUT THE

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:19.556
BENEFITS ARE- POTENTIALLY IN

00:44:19.623 --> 00:44:21.692
CERTAIN. THINGS LIKE- ANIMAL

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:24.161
SHELTER OUT REACH RESEARCH ON

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:26.697
ALTERNATIVE MEAT PRODUCTS-

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:29.333
RESEARCH ON DEVELOPING NEW

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.201
EDUCATION BASED TECHNOLOGIES.

00:44:31.268 --> 00:44:32.903
WE ALSO NOTE THAT ALL OF THE

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.138
ONETIME PROPOSALS MEANS THAT

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:36.040
THE GOVERNOR'S EFFECTIVELY

00:44:36.106 --> 00:44:38.409
PROPOSING TO SPREAD IT A ONE

00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:39.276
TIME FUNDING OVER MANY

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:41.111
DIFFERENT PRIORITIES THIS

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:42.246
ALLOWS THE STATE TO COVER LOTS

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:44.181
OF PRIORITIES BUT IT ALSO.

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:46.517
SPREADS FUNDS SIMPLY AND

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:47.618
POTENTIALLY UNDERMINES THE

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:49.253
STATE'S ABILITY TO ADDRESS ANY

00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:51.555
OF THESE PRIORITIES

00:44:51.622 --> 00:44:53.257
MEANINGFULLY OR FULLY. ONE

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:54.358
ALTERNATIVE THE LEGISLATURE

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:55.926
COULD CONSIDER IT TO BE A BIT

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:58.395
MORE STRATEGIC AND PRIORITIZE

00:44:58.462 --> 00:44:59.229
PROVIDING MORE ONE TIME

00:44:59.296 --> 00:45:02.132
FUNDING- FOR A SELECT NUMBER OF

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:04.034
ONE OF PRIORITIES THAT. ARE AT

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:06.136
THE HIGHEST. BENEFIT TO THE

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:07.771
STATE AND OF THE HIGHEST

00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:10.207
INTEREST TO THE LEGISLATURE.

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:11.608
THE FINAL ISSUE I WANT TO TOUCH

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:13.043
ON IS ACTUALLY NOT IN THIS

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.578
TABLE IT'S A LANGUAGE ONLY

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:16.847
ISSUE AND THAT IS THE OFFICE OF

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:19.917
THE PRESIDENT'S LINE ITEM. NOW

00:45:19.983 --> 00:45:22.352
IS STARKLY YOU SEE. HAS HAD THE

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:23.620
ABILITY TO ALLOCATE FUNDS TO

00:45:23.687 --> 00:45:25.656
THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT I'M

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:27.524
FROM THEIR APPROPRIATION- BUT A

00:45:27.591 --> 00:45:29.393
FEW YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.595
ENACTED- A LINE ITEM ON THE

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:33.063
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WITH

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.465
THE INTENT OF GETTING MORE

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:36.433
OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL OVER THE

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:36.967
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S

00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:38.669
BUDGET. ON THE ADMINISTRATION

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:41.205
IS NOW REQUESTING TO ELIMINATE

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:42.573
THIS LINE ITEM AND GIVE YOU

00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:45.809
SEE- MORE FLEXIBILITY TO MANAGE

00:45:45.876 --> 00:45:48.245
ITS RESOURCES ACROSS THE SYSTEM.

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:50.347
ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WE

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:51.815
RECOMMEND MAINTAINING THE

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:52.416
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S LINE

00:45:52.483 --> 00:45:55.619
ITEM- FOR ONE THING WE THINK

00:45:55.686 --> 00:45:57.521
THAT THE COST PRESSURES SMALL

00:45:57.588 --> 00:45:58.522
DATE THERE ARE SOME SIMILAR

00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:00.224
COST PRESSURES BETWEEN THE

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.858
CAMPUSES IN THE OFFICE OF THE

00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:03.060
PRESIDENT- THERE ARE SOME

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:03.660
DIFFERENCES THE OFFICE OF THE

00:46:03.727 --> 00:46:05.529
PRESIDENT DOESN'T. FACE A ROMAN

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:07.764
GROWTH FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T FACE

00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:09.233
COST PRESSURES WERE WITH A

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:11.401
STUDENT ON SUCCESS AND IT

00:46:11.468 --> 00:46:12.202
SHOULD HAVE YOUR STUDENT

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:13.470
SERVICES. I THINK IT'S

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:14.771
REASONABLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:15.572
WANT TO TARGET FUNDS

00:46:15.639 --> 00:46:18.542
DIFFERENTLY FOR THESE DIFFERENT

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:20.010
DIVISIONS WITHIN YOU SEE. WE

00:46:20.077 --> 00:46:21.578
ALSO THINK HAVING A LINE ITEM

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:23.447
AND IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY WHICH

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:24.781
WE UNDERSTAND THAT

00:46:24.848 --> 00:46:26.450
ADMINISTRATION'S RATIONALE OF

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:27.417
PROPOSING NEW REPORTING

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:28.752
REQUIREMENTS. WITHIN THOSE

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:30.387
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- ARE

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:32.189
WORTHY OF ADOPTING. BUT WE

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:33.323
THINK HAVING A LINE ITEM

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:34.925
FURTHER ENHANCES TRANSPARENCY

00:46:34.992 --> 00:46:36.627
BY CLARIFYING HOW MUCH STATE

00:46:36.693 --> 00:46:38.562
FUNDING IS BEING PROVIDED TO

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.297
THESE DIVISIONS. WE DO

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:42.432
RECOMMEND SOME MODIFICATION TO

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:44.067
THE CURRENT LINE ITEM FOR

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:45.569
EXAMPLE THERE'S A THERE'S ONE

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:46.570
PART OF THE ONE ITEM THAT

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:47.938
PROVIDES FUNDING FOR A PROGRAM

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:49.673
CALLED YOU SEE PAST. THIS IS A

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.775
CENTRALIZED ADMINISTRATIVE

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:55.646
PROGRAM- THAT FOCUS ON THINGS

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:56.113
LIKE PAYROLL AND HUMAN

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:59.216
RESOURCES- SHIFTING THOSE FUNDS

00:46:59.283 --> 00:46:59.983
BACK TO THE CAMPUS

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.318
APPROPRIATION WOULD ALLOW THE

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:03.353
UNIVERSITY TO FUND THE PROGRAM

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.223
BY CHARGING CAMPUSES FEES. WE

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:07.991
THINK THAT MODEL IS A BIT MORE

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:10.294
EFFICIENT IT WAS. IT BETTER IN

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.095
SOME DEVICE CAMPUSES TO MANAGE

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:13.564
THEIR OWN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.766
WHEN SUPPORTING THIS PROGRAM.

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:17.467
THIS PARTICULAR ONE FOR FREE C.

00:47:17.534 --> 00:47:18.335
PAP THE PARTICULAR WE

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:21.505
RECOMMEND- SHIFTING THAT BACK

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:23.073
TO THE CAMPUSES. AGAIN FOR THE

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.208

THE INVESTED ENDOWMENT

00:54:23.326 --> 00:54:25.195
PRINCIPAL CAN DECREASE IN VALUE

CAN BE LIMITED TO UNDER

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:45.615

FOR THE COMMITTEE'S

00:55:04.734 --> 00:55:06.469
CONSIDERATION IS WHETHER THESE

TINY BIT OF CONTEXT SENSING

EIGHT NO HEALTHIER TREATABLE

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:36.773
ANIMAL BE EUTHANIZED THAT WERE

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:38.274
THE MOST POPULOUS STATE IN THE

00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:40.343
COUNTRY TO BE FAIR AND THERE

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:41.511
HAS BEEN SOME PROGRESS MADE BUT%

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:42.845
MANY OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:44.814
COMMUNITIES SEVEN LEFT BEHIND.

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:47.150
AND RURAL AREAS AND POCKETS OF

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:49.719
URBAN AREAS. AND WE STILL SEE

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:51.454
THE HIGHEST RATES OF INTAKE AND

00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:53.289
EUTHANASIA AND ARTS REGIONS

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:54.424
THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE AN

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:55.658
OPPORTUNITY TO LEVEL THE

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:57.460
PLAYING FIELD. AND ENSURE THAT

00:59:57.527 --> 00:59:59.162
ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE SERVED BY

00:59:59.228 --> 01:00:00.964
SHELTERS THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.998
TO KEEP ANIMALS HEALTHY AND

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:03.633
SAFE GET THEM OUT THE DOOR

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.435
LIGHTS AND KEEP PETS AND PEOPLE

TOGETHER. AND THEN TO PROVIDE

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:08.304
SOME MORE RECENT CONTACTS THE

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:10.673
COMBINATION. AND WILDFIRES

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.108
HIGHLIGHTED THE ESSENTIAL ROLE

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:13.943
THAT SHOT JUST PLAY IN

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.812
CALIFORNIA'S CRISIS RESPONSE

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:17.847
AND RECOVERY SHELTERS PROVIDING

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.315
CARE FOR PETS AND PEOPLE ARE

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:21.117
HOSPITALIZED WITH COLIN. THEY

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:22.852
FOUND WAYS TO DELIVER IT TO

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:24.287
PEOPLE WHO ARE HOME BOUND SO IT

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.822
COULD STAY WITH THEIR ANIMALS

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:27.056
THEY CARE FOR PETS AND PEOPLE

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.758
WHO ARE DISPLACED BY WILDFIRES

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:30.560
AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A GROUP

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:31.661
CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.363
SAFETY RECALL. A KEEPING

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:35.932
DANGEROUS INTERNET ANIMALS- OFF

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:38.735
THE STREETS AND PROPERLY CARED

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.003
FOR AGAIN WE SAW THE LEAST

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:41.537
RESOURCE CENTER STRUGGLING TO

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:42.772
MEET THE NEEDS OF THE HARDEST

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:44.974
HIT COMMUNITIES. AND AS WE MOVE

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:48.111
INTO THE RECOVERY PHASE WE ALSO

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:49.846
SEE THAT WE ARE SEEING SOME

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:50.847
THREATS AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:51.848
GO BACK TO WORK AND OTHER

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:53.249
PEOPLE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.284
WITH THE ECONOMIC. FALLOUT IN

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.353
INTAKE CONTINUES TO RISE AT

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.789
SHELTERS SO THIS ONE TIME

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.324
INVESTMENT WOULD PROVIDE BOTH

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:02.959
THE TRAINING FOR OUR PROGRAM.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.927
AND THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:07.130
TARGETED GRANTS FOR SOLDIERS TO

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:19.642
SUPPORT PEOPLE AND FAMILIES.

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:20.209
THROUGHOUT THE RECOVERY AND

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:20.943
BEYOND. THANK YOU I WAS VERY

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.780
ENOUGH. YES HE WORKED WITH YOU

AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:25.081
QUEST BUT LET ME MAKE A COMMON

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:28.151
ABOUT THAT FOR. IT WHICH IS. I

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:29.018
CHAIRED A MAY SPECIAL ONE I WAS

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:30.153
IN ASSEMBLY AND THE ESTIMATE

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:32.288
FOR THE ANNUAL COST OF THAT

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:34.490
MANDATE AT THE TIME OF THE

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:37.727
ADOPTION OF THE BILL. IN

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:38.661
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WAS THREE

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:40.630
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THEN

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:42.865
THIS LINE ITEM IS FIFTEEN TIMES

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:45.068
THAT IT IS A FRACTION OF WHAT

01:01:45.134 --> 01:01:48.137
THE STATE SPENDS ON ANIMAL

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:50.106
SHELTERS AND SO. THAT THAT IS

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:52.408
JUST A CONTEXT TO BE

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.944
CONSIDERED. THE THERE THERE WAS

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:58.081
A LOT OF SUBJECTS ARE RAISED

01:01:58.147 --> 01:02:00.416
HERE AND SO WHAT THE BEGIN OF

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.118
WITH A FEW QUESTIONS AND THEN

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.387
GO TO MY COLLEAGUES. FOR THE

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:07.023
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WERE ME

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.491
BEGIN BY ASKING WHAT THE

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.860
RATIONALE WAS. FOR KEEPING

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:14.730
ENROLLMENT FLAT AT UC AND NOT

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:17.767
FUNDING ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:18.868
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SURE

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.404
LAYERED SO THE MAY REVISION AS

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.172
YOU KNOW DOES NOT SPECIFY

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:25.775
ENROLLMENT TARGETS FOR YOU SEE

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:27.777
THIS IS ALSO FOR CSU- WE

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:28.911
RECOGNIZE THE CALIFORNIA

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:31.647
RESIDENT ROLE MEANT. AT UC AND

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.316
CSU IS A PRIORITY FOR THE

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:35.151
LEGISLATURE WE'RE OPEN TO

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:36.953
FURTHER DISCUSSION. THE

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:38.688
ADMINISTRATION IS INTERESTED IN

01:02:38.754 --> 01:02:40.890
WORKING WITH UC AND CSU ON WHAT

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:42.825
A ROMAN TARGETS COULD LOOK LIKE

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:46.662
NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. AS

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:48.231
PRIORITIES FOR THOSE SECONDS.

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:49.565
LET ME JUST MAKE A QUICK

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.367
COMMENT BECAUSE WE JUST HAD A

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.936
HEARING ON ON THIS LAST WEEK.

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:56.639
AND I THINK THE DYNAMICS WERE

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:58.941
FASCINATING WHICH IS. THE

01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:01.577
LEGISLATURE WAS VERY INTERESTED

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:05.047
IN- ANNULMENT CAP THE TWO

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:06.949
CAMPUSES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:08.951
OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS WE

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:10.586
HEARD FROM SOME OUT OF STATE

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:12.388
STUDENTS THAT DON'T. WANT

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.725
CHANGES AND WE ALSO HEARD FROM

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:17.727
PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING DIVERTED

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:18.995
FROM THEIR FIRST CHOICE THAT

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:20.830
OUR- KIDS OF CALIFORNIA

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:24.400
TAXPAYERS. AND SO THE FACT THAT

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.669
26% OF UC BERKELEY FOR EXAMPLE

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:28.604
WAS OUT OF STATE STUDENTS IS

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:29.805
JUSTIFIED ON THE MONEY IT

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:32.642
BRINGS BUT THEN A NUMBER OF IN

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:33.843
STATE STUDENTS ARE BEING

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.378
DIVERTED AWAY FROM THAT AS

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:38.114
THEIR FIRST CHOICE. AND SO IT

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.883
IS ME MOVING PIECES AND IF

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:44.053
THERE IS. TO BE SOME CHANGES IN

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.454
THAT WHICH YOU SEE CLEARLY

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:47.490
DIDN'T WANT ONE POINT WE

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:49.859
DISCUSSED THIS LAST WEEK ONE OF

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.694
THE WAYS TO CUSHION THAT IS

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:53.696
ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:55.198
AND IMPLY THAT IN STATE

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:56.632
STUDENTS IN A WAY THAT IT

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:58.100
RELEASES THAT PRESSURE SOME

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:00.870
MORE SO. THAN JUST MAKE THAT

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:04.674
COMMENT AND WE WILL GO TO IT. I

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.809

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:49.912
IMPLEMENTED. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:50.579
IMPORTANT TO NOTE. JUST BECAUSE-

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:52.948
THE MOVE THE LINE ITEM. DID NOT

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:55.685
COME FROM THIS HOUSE BUT IF IN

01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:58.120
FACT- THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY

01:05:58.187 --> 01:06:00.456
CHANGE A THRESHOLD ISSUE WILL

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:02.158
BE. THAT THE AUDIT

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:03.993
RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE TO HAVE

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.896
BEEN MET SO I THINK. THE ROOM

01:06:06.962 --> 01:06:07.963
NOT EVEN AT THIS HEARING BUT

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:09.498
MAYBE ONE IN THE OTHER HOUSE

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:10.733
THAT'S WHERE THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.868
MUCH MORE OF AN ISSUE. AND

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:15.938
INCLUDED. IN THE OFFICE OF THE

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:20.242
PRESIDENT IS- AGATE NATURAL

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.712
RESOURCES A. N. R. AND I ASKED

01:06:22.778 --> 01:06:24.714
THE QUESTION AT A PREVIOUS

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:27.483
HEARING AND GOT A UNSATISFYING

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:30.786
ANSWER AND IT REFLECTS ON THIS

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.121
ISSUE SO LET ME TRY AGAIN. I

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:33.155
THINK THE COMMITTEE IS

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:36.759
INTERESTED. IN TRYING TO HELP

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:38.094
COOPERATIVE AGRICULTURAL

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.463
EXTENSION THAT GOES THROUGH YOU

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:42.064
SEE TO THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:44.467
ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IF THE

01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:46.669
FUNDING IS BEEN FLAT FOR TEN TO

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:47.837
FIFTEEN YEARS THERE WERE MAJOR

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:49.905
CUTS MADE AT THE TIME OF THE

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:52.341
REDUCTIONS AND SO THEY'RE BEEN

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.744
VACANCIES IN STEP BACKS AND

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:57.613
GRADUAL CUTS OVER TIME. AND I

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.481
THINK THE COMMITTEE IS

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:00.516
INTERESTED IN USING THIS

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:02.118
ECONOMIC SITUATION TO MOVE

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:04.920
AHEAD AND WHEN I PASSED AT A

01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:07.289
PREVIOUS HEARING AND I WANNA

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:09.592
TRY TO PARAPHRASE CORRECTLY. IF

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:11.627
WE PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.462
THAT PURPOSE HOW WE WERE

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:16.031
GUARANTEED IT WOULD GO FOR THAT

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:18.701
PURPOSE. THERE WAS NOT A

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:21.103
PARTICULARLY SATISFYING ANSWER

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:24.206
SO ONLY ASK AGAIN. IF WE WERE

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:26.542
TO PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET. TO

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.878
TRY TO REHABILITATE- AG

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:30.913
COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.449
HOW DO WE KNOW EVERY DOLLAR WE

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:35.818
PUT FOR THAT PURPOSE WE'LL GO

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:38.888
FOR THAT PURPOSE AND THAT'S TO

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:42.258

LEVEL YOU WANT. THERE ARE TWO

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.914
POSSIBLE FUNDING MECHANISMS

01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:40.516
WITHOUT THE LINE ITEM THAT CAN

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:43.185
ALSO BE UTILIZED ONE IS THE

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:44.987
CAMPUS ASSESSMENT THAT WE

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:46.922
UTILIZE PRIOR TO THE LINE ITEM.

01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:48.457
WE ALSO HAVE SOMETHING CALLED

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:50.693
CAMPUS SET ASIDES. THESE ARE

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.561
PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED SORT

01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:54.463
OF OFF THE TOP OF THE GENERAL

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.299
ALLOCATION BEFORE THE FUNDS ARE

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:58.934
DISTRIBUTED FOR OTHER PURPOSES-

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:00.769
WE FIND CERTAIN PROGRAMS ARE

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:01.904
VERY IMPORTANT TO THE

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.772
LEGISLATURE AND TO OUR SYSTEM

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:06.375
IN THIS MANNER. FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:09.678
STATE PROGRAMS RECEIVE A- SET

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:12.414
ASIDE. EACH YEAR TO ENSURE THAT

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.583
THEY ARE FULLY FUNDED- SO DO

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:15.985
THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:18.354
STATIONS SO WE COULD MOVE AT UC

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:21.457
ANR TWO EIGHT SET ASIDE. IN

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:26.428
ORDER TO ENSURE THAT. THEY ARE

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:27.029
GUARANTEED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:28.430
FUNDING. OKAY I THINK OUR STAFF

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.599
MIGHT WORK WITH YOU ON THAT IT

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:33.035
REALLY REFLECTS ON THE ISSUE

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:36.338
OF- BOTTOM. OF THE LINE ITEM

01:09:36.405 --> 01:09:39.008
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IF

01:09:39.074 --> 01:09:41.343
WE APPROPRIATE FOR SOMETHING IT

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:45.014
GOES FOR SOMETHING. AND SO. YOU

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.682
KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:48.951
YOU JUST SAID TO YOU. AND I'M

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.387
ALWAYS- A SKEPTIC IN SOME WAYS

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.421
BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE THERE

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:54.456
MIGHT BE A COUPLE OF LOOPHOLES

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:55.558
IN THERE I JUST WANT TO KNOW

01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:57.026
FOR SURE. THAT WITH

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.894
APPROPRIATED FOR PURPOSE IT

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.129
GOES FOR THE PURPOSE OF WILL

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:03.198
HAVE THE STAFF WORK WITH YOU IN

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:03.766
CASE STARTS BUDGET LANGUAGE

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:06.035
SURE- FULL FURTHER THINGS AND

01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:09.171
THEN. MAYBE ONE MORE QUESTION

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:10.506
BEFORE GOING TO MY COLLEAGUES.

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:16.779
MMHM THE THERE WAS THE ISSUE OF

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.180
I WOULD REFER TO IT AS A WORK

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:20.549
STUDY PROGRAM BOOKMARK BASED

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:22.885
FINANCIAL AID THAT WAS

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:26.989
DISCUSSED- IN MAY BE STARTING

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.124
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:31.794
WHY ö

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.496
BASED FINANCIAL AID A PRIORITY

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:37.866
OVER DIRECT GRANT AID. WHY WAS

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:39.468
THAT DECISION MADE TO DO IT

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:43.572
THAT WAY. SEOUL SAY THAT THIS

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:45.608
IS IN COMBINATION WITH

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:47.309
CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN THE

01:10:47.376 --> 01:10:49.945
STATE'S MOST SIGNIFICANT DIRECT

01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:52.114
AID CAL GRANTS SIX CETERA. THIS

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:54.250
IS A SUPPLEMENTARY- PROGRAM

01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:56.318
THAT WOULD BE AIMED AT THE

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:58.287
OVERALL ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY.

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:00.556
SO JUST TO GIVE YOU THE HIGH

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:01.156
LEVEL JUSTIFICATION THERE IT'S

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:04.593
THAT. BIG PICTURE QUESTION HOW

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.429
DO YOU TURN ONE TIME. FUNDING

01:11:07.496 --> 01:11:08.530
WHEN THE STATE ONLY HAS

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.933
RESOURCES ONE TIME- DOESN'T

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.301
CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE AND

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:14.236
MAKE THAT AN ONGOING RESOURCE

01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:15.838
AND THIS IS AN INNOVATIVE

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.873
PROPOSAL THAT WOULD WITH THE

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.975
ENDOWMENT CREATE AN ONGOING PAY

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:22.311
OUT. TO STUDENTS IN ALL THE

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:26.015
SEGMENTS AND THAT THAT'S OUR-

01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:28.550
THE ALTERNATIVE OF MAKING SOME

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:30.552
ONE TIME INVESTMENT IN DIRECT

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:32.821
AID. WOULD ONLY HAVE THAT ONE

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:35.124
TIME IMPACT ON ON ONE YEAR OF

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:36.692
STUDENTS OR OR YOU KNOW

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.594
POTENTIALLY ONE COHORT BUT THIS

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:41.163
PROPOSAL WAS FRAMED. TO ATTACK

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:42.064
THE BIGGER PROBLEM OF

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:44.733
AFFORDABILITY AND WE'RE FOCUSED

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.002
ON THE THAT BIG QUESTION OUT.

PROVIDING DIRECT SUBSIDIES

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:52.307
THROUGH CAL GRANT THAT ALREADY

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:55.577
EXIST HOW DO YOU SUPPLEMENT

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:56.111
THAT WITH WITH AN ONGOING

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:58.814
RESOURCE. THANK YOU A FREE

THIS ALSO IS A THING WE HAD A

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:07.256
HEARING ON- LAST WEEK. AND I

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:09.024
THINK IT WAS OUR GENERAL

01:12:09.091 --> 01:12:13.062
DIRECTION. THAT BROADLY

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:16.699
REFORMED A CAL GRANT PROGRAM

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:19.168
WITH LESS RESTRICTIONS ALLOWING

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:22.237
REENTRY STUDENTS ARE EXPEDITED

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:26.809

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:27.376
SPENCE'S THAT WEREN'T JUST

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:30.245
FEES. WORK ORDER THAT WE HAVE

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:31.513
AN OPPORTUNITY OF DOING THAT

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.482
NOW AND I KNOW THAT SME OF IT

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.651
IS ON GOING MONEY BUT I THINK

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:38.087
THAT THE- THE COMMITTEE IS

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:40.556
REALLY INTERESTED IN THAT AND

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:42.124

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:43.726
JUST WITH THIS ITEM WE'RE GOING

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:45.260

MANY PIECES OF STUDENT AID THAT

BUDGET FOR THE THREE BRANCHES

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:57.139
BUT I WOULD. CALL THAT OUT AS A

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:58.640

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:57.065
WE DO IT ALL. GIVEN THE FACT

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:58.634
THAT THERE'S ONE TIME MONEY SO

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.769
IT IS REALLY THE BROADER DIRECT

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:02.437
STUDENT AID AND THEN WORK

CONSIDERATION OF INCREASING

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:43.612

UPCOMING YEAR- PROVIDES

01:14:53.055 --> 01:14:55.257
APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED SIX

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:58.727
MILLION IN UNDERGOING FUNDS.

01:14:58.794 --> 01:14:59.862
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

CONSIDERING A NEW TUITION

01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:06.835
FINANCING MODEL CALLED COVERT

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.570
BASED TUITION WHICH WOULD

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:11.139
ENSURE THAT WHILE ENROLLED NO

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.608
YOU SEE STUDENT WOULD SEE THEIR

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:14.743
FEES INCREASED. THE FEES WOULD

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:17.312
INCREASE- BEFORE THE STUDENT

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:19.047
AND ROLLS AND THEY WOULD KNOW

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:21.083
EXACTLY WHAT THE COST OF THEIR

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:23.051
EDUCATION WOULD BE. MODEL HAS

01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:26.188
NOT YET BEEN ADOPTED NOR ARE

01:15:26.255 --> 01:15:29.825
HAS TUITION BEEN INCREASED OR-

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:32.294
OR FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:33.695
THAT IS STILL BEING CONSIDERED

01:15:33.762 --> 01:15:35.530
AND THE MODEL MAY BE ADOPTED

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:37.599
WITHOUT RAISING TUITION AS

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:40.335
WELL- THE INTENT OF THE MODEL

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:42.704
IS TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:44.106
STUDENTS FALL THEY'RE INVOLVED

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:45.007
AT THEIR FEES WOULD NOT

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:48.510
INCREASE. AND IT WOULD BE- ALSO

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:50.579
INCREASE THE FINANCIAL AID

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:52.681
AVAILABLE TO OUR POOREST

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:54.850
STUDENTS TO HELP THEM KEEP UP

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:57.185
WITH THE COST OF LIVING SO THAT

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:58.186
THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE OUT

01:15:58.253 --> 01:15:59.888
MORE LOANS TO LONGER THERE ARE

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:03.258
GOLD- IF I CAN ASK A FOLLOW UP

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:08.363
QUESTION IT. JUST FOR A MOMENT

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:08.964
BECAUSE I THINK. THE CALL WAS

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:10.732
JUST ABOUT THE MODEL AND IN

01:16:10.799 --> 01:16:12.834
DEFENSE OF YOU EE. THE

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:14.002
DISCUSSION OF TUITION WAS

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.104
INITIATED ON THE AGENDA BEFORE

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:18.674
ANYBODY KNEW WHAT TO MAY REVISE

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.709
ADDITIONAL FUNDING WAS GOING TO

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:22.678
BE I THINK THE QUESTION IS.

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:25.781
SORT OF WHY RAISE TUITION. A

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.783
WITH ALL THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:29.084
THAT'S BASE LEVEL FUNDING

01:16:29.151 --> 01:16:31.987
THAT'S COMING FROM THE STATE

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:34.990
FOR UC IT. THANK YOU SIR FOR

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:37.626
THE CLARIFICATION- IF YOU SEE

01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:39.094
WAS TO RECEIVE SUFFICIENT

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:41.296
FUNDING TO COVER OUR COSTS FOR

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:45.600
OPERATING INCREASES FOR. THE

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:46.635
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YEAR WE

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:47.903
MAY NOT HAVE NEED TO RAISE

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.504
TUITION AND THOSE DECISIONS MAY

01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:51.907
BE PUT OFF- FURTHER INTO THE

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:54.710
FUTURE AND THEN THAT. LEADS TO

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:56.712
THE OPENING OF WHAT IS ADEQUATE

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:59.081
FUNDING TO DIVERT THAT DO YOU

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:01.249
BELIEVE THAT WHAT'S IN THE MAY

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:04.886
REVISE IS ADEQUATE. TO NOT. TO

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:06.121
HANDLE THE BASE FUNDING

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:09.658
EXPENSES TO NOT GO TO THE

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:11.760
REGIONS FOR TUITION INCREASE-

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:13.929
IT IS FORTY EIGHT TWENTY ONE

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:15.397
TWENTY TWO PER YEAR WHICH

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:19.468
COVERS- ARE. ARE REQUESTED MOST

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:21.003
OF OUR REQUESTED INVESTMENTS

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:22.537
AND ALL OF OUR MANDATORY COST

01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:26.742
INCREASES- BUT FOUR D. TWENTY

TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR AT

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:28.944
THE UNIVERSITY WILL HAVE. YET

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:31.480
ANOTHER SET OF MANDATORY COST

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:32.848
INCREASES THAT WILL DISCUSS

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:34.483
NEXT YEAR WITH YOU AND

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:36.251
HOPEFULLY THE STATE'S REVENUES

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.620
WILL CONTINUE TO BE ROBUST AND

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:40.989
TUITION INCREASE SAYS- DO YOU

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:42.491
DON'T HAVE TO BE UNDERTAKEN OR

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:44.526
CAN BE REVERSED. SO THOSE

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:46.361
STUDENTS ARE NOT PERMITTED IN

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:48.897
ANY WAY- THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:50.866
PRIOR YEARS BOUGHT OUT YOU

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:53.668
SEIZED- TUITION INCREASES

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:55.103
AREN'T WHAT ME THANK MY

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.938
COLLEAGUE SENATOR TROUBLED FOR

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.407
LETTING ME DO THAT FOLLOW UP

01:17:58.473 --> 01:17:59.975
AND CLARIFICATION WILL GO BACK

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:04.513
TO HER. FOR A REMAINING

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:05.414
QUESTIONS. THIS IS WHY TRUST

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.315
EXPERTISE IN YOUR- AND- LAYERED

01:18:07.382 --> 01:18:09.785
YOU CAN COME IN AT ANY TIME.

01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:12.020
FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES. AND

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:13.255
I DO HAVE A QUESTION WITH

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:17.059
REGARDS TO- THE MANY ITEMS THAT

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:20.929
WE ARE- FINANCING- IN ARGENTA-

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:22.898
THE ON GOING AND THE ONE TIME

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.766
FUNDING AND SO FORTH. I'M KIND

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:26.068
OF YOURS AND I BELIEVE THIS MAY

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.269
BE A QUESTION FOR THE

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:29.237
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:32.741
WITH REGARDS TO ACCOUNTABILITY

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.409
SO THE STATE IS INVESTING A LOT

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:36.445
OF MONEY IN THESE PROGRAMS HOW

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:38.213
DOES THE STATE HAD TO DO WITH

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.816
THE LEGISLATURE- FOLLOW UP AND

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:43.418
MAKE SURE THAT. THESE FINDINGS

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:46.588
ARE- SPENT THE WAY THAT THEY

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:47.923
ARE BEING APPROPRIATED IS THERE

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:51.026
ANY- TOOLS OR ANYTHING IN SUCH

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:52.794
A THAT WILL HAVE IN ORDER TO

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:53.295
MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:55.764
ACCOUNTABILITY. MOVING FORWARD

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:57.466
SAY IN A YEAR TWO YEARS WHEN WE

01:18:57.532 --> 01:18:58.733
HAVE A REPORT OR DO WE HAVE A

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.570
REPORT THAT COMES BACK AND SAYS

01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:02.170
OKAY THIS IS HOW WE SPEND THE

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:08.343
MONEY. YEAH THAT'S A- THAT'S A

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.412
KEY QUESTION OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:14.049
FACES EVERY YEAR- WHAT'S THAT

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:15.383
SO LOOK THERE TWO WAYS REALLY

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:17.152
THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO ENSURE

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:19.821
THE FUNDS ARE OURS STANDS- THE

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:21.823
WAITING TENS AND IDEALLY THE

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:24.292
LEGISLATURE DOES BOTH THE FIRST

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:27.562
IS TO SPECIFY PROVISIONS IN THE

01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:31.066
BUDGET BILL ITSELF THAT DIRECT-

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:32.934
FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE HOW TO

01:19:33.001 --> 01:19:34.636
SPEND THE FUNDS- AND THEN THE

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:37.506
SECOND- TOOL TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:41.343
HAS. IS REPORTING- AFTER THAT-

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:43.812
INITIATIVE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED-

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.247
USUALLY DOES SUBMIT A NUMBER OF

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:47.048
REPORTS BUT FOR A LOT OF THESE

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:48.583
NEW INITIATIVES PARTICULARLY

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:51.186
ONE TIME INITIATIVES- IN ORDER

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:52.154
TO GET INFORMATION YOU NEED TO

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.955
ENSURE THAT THERE ARE REPORTING

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:55.323
REQUIREMENTS OTHERWISE THERE

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.759
THERE WON'T BE- AUTOMATIC

01:19:57.826 --> 01:19:59.528
REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE-

01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:01.997
THE REGIONS DO- OVERSIGHT

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:03.231
HEARINGS SO SOMETIMES THESE.

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:04.466
INITIATIVES ARE DISCUSSED IN

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:06.234
THE BOARD OF REGENTS AND- THOSE

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:09.004
pLEGISLATURE ALSO HAS THE

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:10.438
ABILITY TO HOLD AN

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:11.907
INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS IN

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:12.507
FUTURE YEARS ON THESE

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:14.609
INITIATIVES. I'M ALSO MANY

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:15.443
INITIATIVES IN THE BUDGET

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:16.945
OBVIOUSLY THAT CAN BE THAT CAN

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:19.314
BE QUITE CHALLENGING- TO DO ON

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:21.249
EVERY ITEM SO I TYPICALLY

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:23.585
REPORTING LANGUAGE ON THIS

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.153
PRETTY KEY THERE. WHEN IT COMES

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:26.922
TO REPORTING LANGUAGE.

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:28.590
SOMETIMES THERE'S A TEMPTATION

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:29.958
TO HAVE REPORTING LANGUAGE BE

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:31.960
VERY BOILER PLATE. A VERY

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:34.062
SIMPLISTIC BUT- USUALLY IT'S

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:35.697
HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.899
THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVES THAT-

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:38.867
THIS INITIATIVE IS TRYING TO

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:40.335
ADDRESS AND THEN THINKING ABOUT

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:42.437
WHICH OUTCOMES- UNIVERSITY

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:44.439
COULD REPORT THAT- ENSURE THE

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:45.607
LEGISLATURE'S TRACKING THAT

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:46.975
THOSE ULTIMATE UTCOMES WERE

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:49.544
MET. SO THERE ARE SOME OF THE

01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:50.011
TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THE

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:53.982
LEGISLATURE. AND I'M ASSUMING

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.952
THAT WILL START. WHEN DO WE

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:59.287
START. REQUIRING THAT LANGUAGE

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:03.792
SHOULD BE ADAM. WELL WE COULD

01:21:03.858 --> 01:21:05.227
DO LANGUAGE AS PART OF THE

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:07.996
BUDGET APPROVAL IF THAT'S WHAT

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:09.864
WE WANTED TO DO AND I THINK

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:11.733
THAT THAT CENTER ROAD TROUBLE

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.168
RAISES A REALLY REALLY GOOD

01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:16.037
ISSUE BECAUSE AS WE MOVE

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:17.439
BROADER IN THIS BUDGET. WE'RE

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:19.007
GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:20.809
THERE'S SOME TRANSPARENCY AND

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.978
HOW THINGS ARE BEING SPENT AND

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.814
WHETHER IT'S ACHIEVING WHAT WAS

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.882
REPRESENTED IN THE BUDGET AND-

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:30.018
NORMALLY WE DO OVERSIGHT AND

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:31.987

INNOVATIVE AS YOUSAID AND AS A

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:03.912
FORMER LAW PROFESSOR. I KNOW

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.714
THE IMPORTANCE OF WORK BASED

EXTERNSHIPS AND ALLIED- I GUESS

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:11.720
MY MAIN QUESTION AND I THINK

01:23:11.786 --> 01:23:13.888
SENATOR. LAYER TO GOT TO THIS A

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:15.957
LITTLE BIT. BUT TO WHAT DEGREE

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:18.493
IS THIS DUPLICATIVE OF EXISTING

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.528
PROGRAMS AND I GUESS FROM MY

01:23:20.595 --> 01:23:21.596
PERSPECTIVE I KNOW THAT

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:23.565
STUDENTS IN THE UC'S WHETHER

01:23:23.631 --> 01:23:24.299
THEIR UNDERGRADS AND GRAD

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:27.936
STUDENTS. OUR OUR GUEST AT SEA

01:23:28.002 --> 01:23:29.137
TRYING TO NAVIGATE THROUGH ALL

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:30.538
THE DIFFERENT AID PROGRAMS ALL

01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:32.173
THE DIFFERENT- PROGRAMS THAT

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.109
THEY CAN ACCESS. AND IT CAN BE

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:35.710
QUITE CONFUSING FOR THEM

01:23:35.777 --> 01:23:36.211
THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS THE

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:39.214
RESOURCES WITHIN THE CAMPUSES

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.782
TO CONNECT UP STUDENTS WITH THE

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:41.950
DIFFERENT TYPES OF AID THAT

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:45.019
THEY MIGHT RECEIVE. I ALSO KNOW

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:45.653
THAT EVERY TIME YOU CREATE NEW

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.689
PROGRAM- YOU HAVE MORE

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:49.524
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WHICH TAP

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:50.692
INTO THAT EFFECTIVELY CREATING

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:53.795
A TAX ON. THE PHONE SO I GUESS

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:55.363
MY QUESTION IS TO WHAT DEGREE

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:58.099
IS THIS APPROACH- DUPLICATIVE

01:23:58.166 --> 01:23:59.634
OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.669
FUNDING FOR A PERIL EITHER

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:03.371
PARALLEL PURPOSES OR THIS EXACT

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:06.441
PURPOSE OF FUNDING INTERNSHIPS

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:07.976

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:09.844
YOUR QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT

SENATOR MEANT. SO THE FROMOUR

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:16.651
PERSPECTIVE THIS IS NOT TO PUT

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.153
IT IN FOR IT IS DESIGNED TO

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:20.622
PARALLEL THE EXISTING FEDERAL

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:23.191
WORK STUDY PROGRAM. THE MAIN

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:25.460
DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE FEDERAL

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.495
WORK STUDY PROGRAM HAS A- A

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:30.598
BROADER CAME. BY SO OUR OUR

01:24:30.665 --> 01:24:31.800
PROGRAM THE STATE FUNDED

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:33.935
VERSION WOULD FOCUS YOU HAVE TO

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:34.602
BE AN UNDERREPRESENTED

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:38.106
BACKGROUND- AS A STUDENT- WHERE

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:40.408
IS THE FEDERAL IS FOCUSED MORE

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:42.444
ON DEMONSTRATED FINANCIAL NEED.

01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:45.246
OURS WOULD ALSO PRIORITIZE STEM

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:49.884
MAJORS AND STEM- EMPLOYERS. DID

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:51.085
THE OTHER KEY DIFFERENCE HERE

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:53.121
AND THIS IS THE ROOT OF THE WHY

01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:55.056
HAVE THIS PROGRAM AT ALL IT'S

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:56.825
THAT THE FEDERAL WORK STUDY-

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:59.694

HIRE FUTURE UC GRADUATES. SO

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:56.017

THERE BUT YET LET ME REPHRASE

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:04.893
MY QUESTION BECAUSE I

01:26:04.959 --> 01:26:06.060
UNDERSTAND YEAH THIS ISN'T NOT

01:26:06.127 --> 01:26:07.829
MEANT TO BE FOR STUDIES IS NOT

HERE IS. I GUESS I JUST

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:19.707
QUESTION- BLUNTLY IS. WATER

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:21.075
PROGRAMS ALREADY EXIST

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:22.310
STATEWIDE AND SOUNDS LIKE

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:23.745
YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NONE AND

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:24.879
THEN AT THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:26.080
WHERE I KNOW THERE ARE

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:29.717
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. TO PROVIDE

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:30.285
FUNDING FOR INTERNSHIPS AND

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:30.919
EXTERNSHIPS. YOU KNOW HAVE YOU

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:32.487
MAPPED THAT OUT TO WHAT DEGREE

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:34.088
DOES THIS TACK ON TO THOSE

01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:36.124
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- YOU KNOW I

01:26:36.190 --> 01:26:37.425
JUST DON'T HAVE A SENSE I KNOW

01:26:37.492 --> 01:26:39.327
THAT MY FORMER EMPLOYER. YOU

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:40.862
SEE AROUND SCHOOL LAW WE HAD

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:42.697
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:43.498
FUNDING FOR INTERNSHIPS AND

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:46.067
EXTERNSHIPS. FOR SOME STUDENTS

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:48.036
I DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF THE

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:48.903
SCALE OF THAT OUTSIDE OF LAW

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:51.005
SCHOOL. OR CERTAINLY OUTSIDE OF

01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:52.874
THE UC IRVINE CAMPUS BUT I

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:54.375
GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION-

01:26:54.442 --> 01:26:55.510
THAT'S YET THANK YOU FOR THE

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:57.111
CLARIFICATION I WOULD SAY WE

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:57.946
DEFINITELY TAKE YOUR POINT

01:26:58.012 --> 01:27:00.248
THAT. PER CAMPUS THERE'S A

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:02.417
RANGE OF VARIOUS INTERNET

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:04.452
EXTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. THE

01:27:04.519 --> 01:27:05.520
KEY DIFFERENCE FROM OUR

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:07.088
PERSPECTIVE AND WHY THIS WOULD

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:09.457
BE NECESSARY IS THAT. WHEN YOU

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:11.259
HAVE A FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:12.794
THROUGH THE FINANCIAL AID

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:15.930
SYSTEM- THOUGH DOES INTERNSHIPS

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:18.366
AND EX EXTERNSHIP CAN OFTEN BE

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:19.434
A SEPARATE FROM THE DESIGN OF

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.369
THAT PACKAGE. AND SO THE IDEA

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:22.770
HERE IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:25.406
BE BUILT IN O. YOUR AT THE

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:27.175
BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR YOU'RE

PACKAGE AS YOUR YOUR WORK STUDY

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:44.926
CONTRIBUTION. SO THAT'S JUST

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:46.494
IT'S A MORE OF A CLOSE LINKAGE

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:49.030
BETWEEN THE OVERALL EXISTING

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:50.732

01:27:50.798 --> 01:27:53.201

THE INDIVIDUAL. IT'S OUR

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:56.137

CHANGE AND WILDFIRES RIGHT NOW

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:51.659
WHY WERE THESE SAYING A

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:53.594
COLLECTED AND NOT GIVEN

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:54.929
RESEARCH FINDING WHERE I THINK

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:55.630
RESEARCH IS GOING TO BE

01:28:55.697 --> 01:28:57.165
IMPORTANT FOR THESE PARTICULAR

01:28:57.231 --> 01:29:00.968
AREAS. ARE AND WHY WERE SOME OF

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:03.805
THESE OTHER ONES SELECTED. I

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:05.306
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ALL ALL

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:07.642
I CAN'T SPEAK RESPECTFULLY TO

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:09.677
WHAT'S NOT WHAT'S NOT HERE SO.

01:29:09.744 --> 01:29:12.246
NO NO CLEAR JUSTIFICATION WE'RE

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:13.548
NOT GOING TO JUSTIFY WHY IT'S

01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:16.317
NOT. IN HERE BUT THE- THE HOW

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.519
WERE THESE SHOWS AND THESE ARE

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:20.088
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES.

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:21.956
CIVICALLY THE EASIEST TO POINT

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:23.424
TO IS THE ANIMAL SHELTER GRANT

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:25.660
PROGRAM. WE HAD PROPOSED THAT

01:29:25.727 --> 01:29:28.229
LAST YEAR. DUE TO THE TWENTY

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:30.064
TWENTY COMPLEXITY. WE DIDN'T

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:31.599
MANAGE TO REACH THE ULTIMATE

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:33.067
GOAL OF GETTING A FULLY FUNDED

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:35.002
GRANT PROGRAM. SO THAT'S BACK

01:29:35.069 --> 01:29:36.871
IN HERE OF COURSE THE- IS AN

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:38.673
AMERICAN STUDIES CENTER THAT

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.708
WAS A UNIDENTIFIED NEED THAT'S

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:42.677
BEEN EXACERBATED RECENTLY AND

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:45.680
SO THAT'S SPEAKING TO THAT- AND

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:48.282
THE SAME WITH DYSLEXIA IS AN

01:29:48.349 --> 01:29:48.816
ESTABLISHED ADMINISTRATION

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:50.885
PRIORITY. ABOUT THE RESTORATION

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:52.520
OF LOTS OF PRIORITIES I GUESS-

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:53.621
YEAH YEAH I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:55.123
WRIT LARGE AS WOULD HAVE BEEN.

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:57.291
PERHAPS MORE EFFICIENT THEY

01:29:57.358 --> 01:29:59.427
JUST SAID WE WANT TO FIND X.

01:29:59.494 --> 01:30:00.695
AMOUNT OF DOLLARS FOR GENERAL

01:30:00.762 --> 01:30:02.697
RESEARCH ON WHAT THE UC'S

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:03.798
DECIDE WHERE THAT'S BEST. THE

01:30:03.865 --> 01:30:08.569
PURPOSE. I WOULD SAY THIS IS

01:30:08.636 --> 01:30:10.071
JUST A CASE OF US TRYING TO BE

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:12.406
SPECIFIC IT AND PRIORITIZE THE

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:15.042
ADMINISTRATION'S- PRIORITIES SO

01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:16.611
THEY'RE THEY'RE REPRESENTED IN

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:18.412
THESE THESE ARE PROPOSALS. I

01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:19.747
APPRECIATE THAT I ONE LAST

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:21.149
QUICK QUESTION BECAUSE JUST

01:30:21.215 --> 01:30:22.383
BEFORE YOU GO TO THAT QUICK

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:25.486
QUESTION LET ME ADD. A COMMENT.

01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:27.622
SENATOR AND THAT IS I WAS

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:29.791
VISITED BY REPRESENTATIVES FOR

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:32.293
TRULY A BY REPRESENTATIVES OF

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.629
UC BERKELEY LAST WEEK. BECAUSE

01:30:34.695 --> 01:30:36.330
THEY'RE SEEKING IN THE CLIMATE

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:38.966
CENTER TO DO WILD FIRE RESEARCH

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:40.935
AND ESTABLISH SORT OF A

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:43.104
WILDFIRE SECTION AND THEY WERE.

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:44.672
SUGGESTING THAT NINE MILLION

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:46.274
DOLLARS OF STATE MONEY MIGHT BE

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:48.075
REALLY HELPFUL TO MATCH TO

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:50.745
OTHER NINE MILLION DOLLARS THAT

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:53.848
MIGHT BE COMING IN AND SO- YOUR

01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:55.750
POINT IS REALLY WITH MERIT

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:57.885
BECAUSE THEY'RE COMING AT US

01:30:57.952 --> 01:30:59.453
WITH WITH DIFFERENT THINGS EVEN

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.389
THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE INCLUDED

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:03.457
IN THIS AND IF THERE WERE. MORE

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:06.427
GLOBAL LOOK RESEARCH AND THEN.

01:31:06.494 --> 01:31:08.296
WE COULD ACTUALLY DIRECT THEM

01:31:08.362 --> 01:31:10.131
TO THEM RATHER THAN COMING TO

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:12.433
US BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN IN THEIR

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.068
BUDGET THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL SO

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:15.536
I THINK THAT WAS IT. A GOOD

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:17.772
GENERAL DIRECTION THANK YOU FOR

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:18.773

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:38.459
QUESTION BUT- I THINK THAT'S

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:41.095
QUESTION FOR ANOTHER DAY- MY

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:45.766
LAST QUESTION IS GOING BACK. TO

THAT THE CAMPUS IS CURRENTLY

01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:14.201

01:36:23.677 --> 01:36:25.379
PREMATURE TO FUND THIS PROPOSAL

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:26.480

VISITING IN THE FUTURE. WE DID

01:36:33.354 --> 01:36:34.989
ALSO JUST WANT TO RAISE SOME

01:36:51.172 --> 01:36:51.872
FROM THE STATE'S CURRENT

01:41:52.473 --> 01:41:54.241
STUDENTS THAT GO THROUGH AND

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:56.510
FOR YEARS AND THE PERCENTAGE

01:41:56.577 --> 01:41:59.913
SYSTEM WIDE HAS GONE UP IN A

01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:01.682
MEASURABLE WAY WHICH THEN. I H.

01:42:01.748 --> 01:42:03.383
MORE MOMENT SPACES BECAUSE

01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:05.819
PEOPLE MOVING THROUGH IN FOUR

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:08.655
YEARS. WITH THE OR I WAS GONNA

01:42:08.722 --> 01:42:10.457
ASK WHAT THE STATUS IS OF THAT

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:12.993
PROGRAM AND I KNOW THAT IN THE

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.962
PAST. THERE'S BEEN A SPECIFIC

01:42:15.028 --> 01:42:16.897
ALLOCATION FOR IT IS THAT

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:20.634
PROGRAM. COVERED ADEQUATELY

01:42:20.701 --> 01:42:25.439
UNDER THE- ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN

01:42:25.506 --> 01:42:28.242
THE MAY REVISION FOR CSU. THANK

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:29.142
YOU SENATOR LAYERED FOR THAT

01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:31.111
QUESTION THE PROGRAM IS CALLED

01:42:31.178 --> 01:42:33.747
THE GRADUATION IS SHIPPED

01:42:33.814 --> 01:42:34.815
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT'S A SIX

01:42:34.882 --> 01:42:37.117
YEAR LONG ENDEAVOR OF. CREASING

01:42:37.184 --> 01:42:40.954
OUR- BASE BUDGET BY ABOUT FOUR

01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:42.923
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:44.758
IN AGGREGATE SO THAT'S BEEN A-

01:42:44.825 --> 01:42:47.628
I THINK WE ARE NOW- FOR THE

01:42:47.694 --> 01:42:48.328
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR WE

01:42:48.395 --> 01:42:49.463
ARE IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF

01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:51.865
ATTEMPTING TO FULLY FUND OUR

01:42:51.932 --> 01:42:54.201
PROPOSAL WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT

01:42:54.268 --> 01:42:56.136
THE DAY HAS A COUPLE OF

01:42:56.203 --> 01:42:57.871
DIFFERENT. HIGH LEVEL GOALS ARE

01:42:57.938 --> 01:42:59.606
MANY SUB LEVEL GOALS ASSOCIATE

01:42:59.673 --> 01:43:01.041
BUT I'LL KEEP A VERY HIGH LEVEL

01:43:01.108 --> 01:43:03.644
FOR BREVITY'S SAKE ULTIMATELY-

01:43:03.710 --> 01:43:04.845
WHEN THE MAJOR GOALS IS TO

01:43:04.912 --> 01:43:07.147
INCREASE GRADUATION RATES WRIT

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:10.284
LARGE. AND SO FAR THE PROGRESS

01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:12.286
THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESS- WE'VE

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:13.520
GONE FROM A FOUR YEAR

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:15.656
GRADUATION RATE IN AT 19% BACK

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:18.892
IN. BACK AT THE START OF THE

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:21.194
INITIATIVE AND WE ARE AT THIRTY

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:22.729
ONE FOR R. 31% FOR A FIRST TIME

01:43:22.796 --> 01:43:24.865
FRESHMEN YOU SEE SIMILAR SORTS

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:29.069
OF INCREASES FOR OUR ALL OF OUR-

01:43:29.136 --> 01:43:30.871
ETHNIC GROUPS OF OUR STUDENTS.

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:31.772
YOU SEE THAT IN TERMS OF

01:43:31.838 --> 01:43:32.806
FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:34.241
GRADUATION RATES ALL OF THOSE

01:43:34.308 --> 01:43:35.742
POSTS HAVE HAVE RISEN AND SO

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:37.344
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING. I

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:38.579
THINK THE ONE THING THAT WE

01:43:38.645 --> 01:43:40.213
STILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.748
IS NEARING WHAT WE CALL THE

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:45.152
EQUITY GAP. WHICH IS WHERE- YES

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:49.222
I. IF YOU KNOW ALL OF US. ALL

01:43:49.289 --> 01:43:50.724
OF OUR STUDENTS ARE PEOPLE AND

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:51.625
WE WANT ALL STUDENTS TO

01:43:51.692 --> 01:43:53.427
GRADUATE AT THE SAME RATES

01:43:53.493 --> 01:43:55.228
ULTIMATELY. RIGHT AND SO THAT'S

01:43:55.295 --> 01:43:56.763
THE GOAL IN IN IN IN IN THE

01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:58.398
CASE OF THE C. ISSUE WE HAVE

01:43:58.465 --> 01:44:00.534
DIFFERENT RATES OF PROGRESS

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.603
BETWEEN YOUR M. STUDENTS. AND

01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:04.171
MORE TRADITIONAL STUDENTS- I

01:44:04.237 --> 01:44:05.672
MEAN THE STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:44:05.739 --> 01:44:07.708
WHITE OR ASIAN DESCENT. THERE'S

01:44:07.774 --> 01:44:09.776
A GAP BETWEEN THOSE TWO. AND IN

01:44:09.843 --> 01:44:11.511
SOME INSTANCES ON CAMPUSES ARE

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:12.713
CAMPUSES THAT NARROW THAT GAP

01:44:12.779 --> 01:44:13.847
COMPLETE OTHER CASES THEY

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:15.582
HAVEN'T SYSTEM WIDE WE HAVE A

01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:17.484
AN OVERALL GAP. IN TERMS OF

01:44:17.551 --> 01:44:20.754
YOUR M. STUDENTS AS WELL AS AND

01:44:20.821 --> 01:44:21.588
INTEL GRANT ELIGIBLE STUDENTS.

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:22.389
SO GETTING TO THE BOTTOM LINE

01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:23.991
OF YOUR QUESTION DOES THAT MAKE

01:44:24.057 --> 01:44:25.325
DOESN'T MIRROR VISION FULLY

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:26.793
FUND THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:29.463
IT DOES. IT FULLY FUNDS WHAT

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:31.231
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES REQUESTED

01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:33.700
IN NOVEMBER WHICH WAS ABOUT ONE

01:44:33.767 --> 01:44:35.802
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:44:35.869 --> 01:44:36.370
TO FULLY FROM THE GRADUATION

01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:37.904
INITIATIVE. WE'RE REALLY

01:44:37.971 --> 01:44:39.506
APPRECIATIVE OF THAT AND I

01:44:39.573 --> 01:44:40.340
THINK THAT'S GOING TO END UP

01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:42.542
BEING A REAL GOOD CORN SEED SO

01:44:42.609 --> 01:44:44.244
TO SPEAK. IN TERMS OF BEING

01:44:44.311 --> 01:44:47.247
ABLE TO REACH OUR GOAL AT EIGHT

01:44:47.314 --> 01:44:47.814
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE OF HAVING

01:44:47.881 --> 01:44:49.116
ALL THOSE EQUITY GAPS NARROWED

01:44:49.182 --> 01:44:51.418
OR ELIMINATED. FULLY THAT'S

01:44:51.485 --> 01:44:52.886
WITH R. U. R. M. STUDENTS AS

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:53.987
WELL AS WITH OUR PELL GRANT

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:55.756
ELIGIBLE POPULATION STUDENTS.

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:59.026
THANK YOU THAT'S REALLY-

01:44:59.092 --> 01:45:00.427
RESPONSIVE ANSWER IN A GOOD

01:45:00.494 --> 01:45:03.096
ANSWER AND- DOES THAT MEAN THAT

01:45:03.163 --> 01:45:05.732
IN A YEAR OR TWO. WE WILL ALL

01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:07.334
BE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:09.102
TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL VERSION

01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:11.071
OF THIS GOING FORWARD AFTER THE

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:12.839
CURRENT TIME FRAME AND GOALS

01:45:12.906 --> 01:45:15.509
ARE COMPLETED. QUITE POSSIBLY-

01:45:15.575 --> 01:45:17.277
THIS PLACE KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:18.845
IS ALWAYS ON THE MARCH TO TRY

01:45:18.912 --> 01:45:20.647
TO DO BETTER SO WE MADE LAYER

01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:22.282
ON TOP OF THIS A NEW INITIATIVE

01:45:22.349 --> 01:45:23.550
COULD EXTEND IT IT JUST

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:25.285
DEPENDS- WE HAVE A BRAND NEW

01:45:25.352 --> 01:45:27.688
CHANCELLOR AND HE HAS TO LAY

01:45:27.754 --> 01:45:29.289
OUT HIS HIS VISION FOR HIS

01:45:29.356 --> 01:45:30.390
ADMINISTRATION HOWEVER LONG

01:45:30.457 --> 01:45:31.892
THAT IS. RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE

01:45:31.958 --> 01:45:32.993
THICK OF THE GRAND IT SHOULD

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:34.161
HAVE BEEN HE'S FULLY SUPPORTIVE

01:45:34.227 --> 01:45:35.128
OF THE ONE THAT WE ARE PURSUING

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:37.130
RIGHT NOW RIGHT AND THEN I HAVE

01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:41.735
ONE. LAST QUESTION. FOR YOU THE

01:45:41.802 --> 01:45:44.871
CSU SYSTEM. THE GOVERNOR- HIS

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:47.274
PROPOSAL ABOUT. MAKING HUMBOLDT

01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:49.309
STATE TO BECOME A POLITICIAN I

01:45:49.376 --> 01:45:50.911
REPRESENTED CAL POLY MY MOTHER

01:45:50.977 --> 01:45:52.479

POLY AND YOU GUYS ALL TALKED

01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:56.717
ABOUT IT. BUT LET ME ASK THE

01:45:56.783 --> 01:45:59.086
QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY IF. IT

01:45:59.152 --> 01:46:01.254
COMES HUMBLED STAGES. HAS ITS

01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:03.724
OWN NICHE NOW IS REALLY STRONG

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:05.826
WHEN I WAS RESOURCES SECRETARY

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:07.294
I THINK A MAJORITY OF THE CAL

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.995
FIRE FORSTER SAID GRADUATED

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:11.431
FROM HUMBOLDT STATE FORESTRY

PROGRAM- WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE.

01:46:15.902 --> 01:46:17.904
THE COURT WHAT WOULD WE SEE.

01:46:17.971 --> 01:46:20.140
OUR OUR IF POSSIBLE STATE

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:21.875
BECOMES A CAL POLY WHAT DO WE

01:46:21.942 --> 01:46:25.579
SEE. FROM THE OUTSIDE. AS A

01:46:25.645 --> 01:46:28.014
DIFFERENCE IN ITS MISSION OR

01:46:28.081 --> 01:46:30.717
OUTPUT HOW IT OPERATES WHAT IT

01:46:30.784 --> 01:46:33.887
MEANS IF POSSIBLE STATE BECOMES

01:46:33.954 --> 01:46:36.189
A COUPLE. WELL OBVIOUSLY

01:46:36.256 --> 01:46:38.225
SENATOR- WE'RE AT THE EARLY

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:40.894
STAGES OF FIGURING THIS OUT AS

01:46:40.961 --> 01:46:42.229
MY COLLEAGUE MISS KING SAID

01:46:42.295 --> 01:46:44.131
FROM THE LA- THE CAMPUS IS

01:46:44.197 --> 01:46:45.832
DOING A SELF REFLECTION OR SELF

01:46:45.899 --> 01:46:49.136
STUDY. ON HOW FEASIBLE IT IS TO

01:46:49.202 --> 01:46:53.206
ADVANCE- COUPLE EIGHT W. I'M

01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:54.574
SORRY HUMBLE TO A POLYTECHNIC.

01:46:54.641 --> 01:46:55.742
I THINK YOU TOUCHED ON ONE OF

01:46:55.809 --> 01:46:58.411
THE MAIN- APPLIED SCIENCES

01:46:58.478 --> 01:47:00.013
PROGRAMS THAT I THINK WOULD BE

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:03.116
STRENGTHENED. AT HUMBLE WHICH

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:05.685
WOULD BE THE FORESTRY- SIDE OF

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:07.854
THINGS YOU ALSO SEE AN INCREASE

01:47:07.921 --> 01:47:09.189
IN A NUMBER OF ENGINEERING

01:47:09.256 --> 01:47:11.691
PROGRAMS- GENERALLY ACROSS THE

01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:13.393
STATE THERE IS A COLOSSAL

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.362
DEMAND FOR. ADDITIONAL

01:47:15.428 --> 01:47:17.130
ENGINEERING SPACE WE OFFER MORE

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:19.432
OF THAT AT HUMBLE. THERE'S ALSO

01:47:19.499 --> 01:47:21.902
OTHER NICHE AREAS IN IN THAT

01:47:21.968 --> 01:47:24.404
AREA OF THE STATE THERE'S A

01:47:24.471 --> 01:47:26.306
LITTLE BIT OF OCEANOGRAPHY. AN

01:47:26.373 --> 01:47:28.275
AQUACULTURE THAT COULD BE

01:47:28.341 --> 01:47:30.143
EXPANDED THERE'S A LOT OF

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:30.911
REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITIES

01:47:30.977 --> 01:47:35.315
THERE- AND- I THINK I THINK

01:47:35.382 --> 01:47:36.516
I'LL STOP THERE I DON'T WANNA

01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:38.318
GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF IT BECAUSE

01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:39.619
OBVIOUSLY THE CAMPUS IS REALLY

01:47:39.686 --> 01:47:41.188
DREADING THIS INTERNALLY IN

01:47:41.254 --> 01:47:43.089
TRYING TO WORK WITH OTHERS IN

01:47:43.156 --> 01:47:44.191
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO WORK

01:47:44.257 --> 01:47:45.759
THROUGH WHAT THE ACADEMIC PLAN

01:47:45.826 --> 01:47:49.262
WOULD BE- BUT BUT CLEARLY- AS

01:47:49.329 --> 01:47:50.730
THERE IS SO MUCH DEMAND AT OUR

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:52.265
OTHER- A POLYTECHNIC

01:47:52.332 --> 01:47:55.502
UNIVERSITIES- THERE IS ROOM. WE

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:57.671
BELIEVE THAT THERE COULD BE A

01:47:57.737 --> 01:47:59.372
THIRD AND IT COULD BE- WELL

01:47:59.439 --> 01:48:01.575
SITUATED TO SERVE MORE

01:48:01.641 --> 01:48:04.077
CALIFORNIANS IN THAT WAY MON I

01:48:04.144 --> 01:48:05.545
APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE- JUST

01:48:05.612 --> 01:48:07.180
NOTE ONE THING OUT OF THE

01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:09.416
RESPONSE WHICH IS IT'S BEING

01:48:09.482 --> 01:48:11.985
VETTED AND NETWORK. ASKING TO

01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:14.421
PROVE WHAT HASN'T TOTALLY BEEN

01:48:14.487 --> 01:48:16.423
VETTED IN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:18.325
WILL TOTALLY BE AND SO I THINK

01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:19.893
THAT'S JUST QUESTION WILL HAVE

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.862
TO GRAPPLE WITH AND NOT. IN THE

01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:23.663
BUDGET PROCESS AND IT GOES BACK

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:25.465
TO CENTER GROVE CHUG CHUG BUGS

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:28.602
QUESTION OF. OF HOW YOU VET HOW

01:48:28.668 --> 01:48:30.737
THINGS ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO

01:48:30.804 --> 01:48:32.439
THE END AND HOW YOU MEASURE

01:48:32.505 --> 01:48:35.242
THEM AND SO. THIS IS A VERY

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:36.776
MUCH A MOVING TARGET I'M SURE

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:38.578
WE'LL HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:39.446
THAT IN THE COMING DAYS AND

01:48:39.512 --> 01:48:41.214
WEEKS. LET ME GO TO MY

01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:46.319
COLLEAGUES OR OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:48:46.386 --> 01:48:47.153
US SENATOR MAN AND THEN. START

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:48.788
WITH. HERE WANTED TO FOLLOW UP-

01:48:48.855 --> 01:48:52.626
ON THE OF FOUR HUMBLED AND- I

01:48:52.692 --> 01:48:53.760
THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE A FINE

01:48:53.827 --> 01:48:56.129
PROPOSAL GIVEN THAT NEEDS FOR

01:48:56.196 --> 01:49:00.333
MORE POLYTECHNIC EDUCATION. BUT

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.235
YOU KNOW I GUESS MY QUESTION IS

01:49:02.302 --> 01:49:04.738
IT FOR ALLOCATING FOUR HUNDRED

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:05.405
THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS

01:49:05.472 --> 01:49:07.607
FOR. CAPITAL NEEDS AND

TOWARD INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:10.704
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION-

THE APPLIED SCIENCES AS WELL

01:50:39.933 --> 01:50:42.802
AS- AS HOUSING IN PARTICULAR-

01:50:42.869 --> 01:50:43.937
ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:45.739
TRANSITION AND TO MEET DEMAND

01:50:45.805 --> 01:50:47.774

WITH THAT RISING STUDENTS- AND-

01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:00.387
AND THAT'S THE REASON FOR AT

01:51:00.453 --> 01:51:01.554
THIS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT

01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:03.556
VERSUS YOU HUMBLE. SURE BUT I

T. S. U. FULLERTON. WHICH IS

01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:12.165
NOT MY DISTRICT PROTEST OUTSIDE-

01:51:12.232 --> 01:51:12.766
WE HAVE HOUSING FOR THERE IN

01:51:12.832 --> 01:51:13.266
FACT THERE STUDENTS ARE

01:51:13.333 --> 01:51:13.933
HOMELESS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.402
THEY'RE LIVING IN THEIR CARS.

01:51:15.468 --> 01:51:18.038
DO YOU HAVE AN URGENT NEED FOR

01:51:18.104 --> 01:51:19.239

02:16:14.699 --> 02:16:17.035
FIRST THERE'S JUST BEEN SOME

02:16:17.102 --> 02:16:19.337
CONFUSION OVER JUST TERMINOLOGY

02:16:19.404 --> 02:16:22.240
COULD YOU EXPLAIN. WHAT A FOUR

02:16:22.307 --> 02:16:26.344
POINT 5% INCREASE COMPOUNDED

02:16:26.411 --> 02:16:28.813
MEANS BY THAT IS IT JUST A FOUR

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:35.420
POINT. 5% INCREASE. SURE DAN

02:16:35.487 --> 02:16:37.489
HAD OUR AND OUR ARGUMENT MY

02:16:37.556 --> 02:16:41.660
BEST- SO I THINK SPECIFICALLY

02:16:41.726 --> 02:16:43.762
THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT

02:16:43.828 --> 02:16:44.696
THAT HAS TRADITIONALLY PROVIDED

02:16:44.763 --> 02:16:47.699
AND- STATUTE IS THE IMPLICIT

02:16:47.766 --> 02:16:50.168
PRICE DEFLATOR AND SO THE

02:16:50.235 --> 02:16:51.169
COUPLE- BASED ON THAT

02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:52.737
CALCULATION FOR THE BUDGET YEAR

02:16:52.804 --> 02:16:54.940
WAS ONE POINT 7% AT THE

02:16:55.006 --> 02:16:56.875
MARAVICH AND- HOWEVER WE

02:16:56.942 --> 02:16:59.044
REALIZE THAT A COST OF LIVING

02:16:59.110 --> 02:17:00.078
ADJUSTMENT WAS NOT PROVIDED TO

02:17:00.145 --> 02:17:03.148
THE- APPORTIONMENT FUNDING IN

02:17:03.214 --> 02:17:04.883
THE CURRENT YEAR. SO WE ALSO

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:06.551
WANTED TO REFLECT THAT FINDING

02:17:06.618 --> 02:17:07.886
OUT THAT THERE IS A VEIL ON

02:17:07.953 --> 02:17:09.287
GOING FUNDING PROVIDED IN THE

02:17:09.354 --> 02:17:11.957
BUDGET SO IN IN ATHENS THE

02:17:12.023 --> 02:17:13.391
COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL BE

02:17:13.458 --> 02:17:17.295
RECEIVING A FOUR POINT 005%

02:17:17.362 --> 02:17:19.397
COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS FOR

02:17:19.464 --> 02:17:20.432
THEIR PORTION THAT'S MOVING

02:17:20.498 --> 02:17:23.535
FORWARD- HOWEVER WE WANTED TO

02:17:23.602 --> 02:17:25.236
SYMBOLICALLY NOTE THAT-

02:17:25.303 --> 02:17:27.105
DIMINISHES AS OPPOSED TO IS TO

02:17:27.172 --> 02:17:32.510
PROVIDE FUNDING. FOR THAT- PORK

02:17:32.577 --> 02:17:36.081
ON COLOR IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

02:17:36.147 --> 02:17:38.350
OKAY IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S

02:17:38.416 --> 02:17:40.652
STILL SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT

02:17:40.719 --> 02:17:42.654
IT MEANS AND SOME PEOPLE THINK

02:17:42.721 --> 02:17:44.656
IT MEANS MORE AND SOMETHING

02:17:44.723 --> 02:17:46.091
PEOPLE THINK IT MEANS LESS AND

02:17:46.157 --> 02:17:48.760
SO ON THERE. YES IF YOU'D LIKE

02:17:48.827 --> 02:17:52.697
I CAN. GO FOR TRANSIT SO I

02:17:52.764 --> 02:17:54.566
THINK ALL IT MEANS IS IN THE

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:56.601
CURRENT THE CURRENT YEAR

02:17:56.668 --> 02:17:58.970
COLLEGES SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN I

02:17:59.037 --> 02:17:59.604
THINK IT WAS AROUND A TWO POINT

02:17:59.671 --> 02:18:01.940
3% ALSO LIVING ADJUSTMENT THEY

02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:03.341
DIDN'T GET THAT BECAUSE OF THE

02:18:03.408 --> 02:18:04.676
TIME WHEN THE BUDGET WAS

02:18:04.743 --> 02:18:07.812
ENACTED A YEAR AGO- THERE WAS A

02:18:07.879 --> 02:18:08.813
LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THE BUDGET

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:10.982
SITUATION. SO FOR THE BUDGET

02:18:11.049 --> 02:18:12.917
YEAR THE GUNNERS RISING ONE

02:18:12.984 --> 02:18:16.154
POINT 7% SO I THINK. THE IDEA

02:18:16.221 --> 02:18:18.490
OF A COMPOUNDED COSTLY JUST IS

02:18:18.556 --> 02:18:20.692
JUST. FIRST THE COLLEGES GET A

02:18:20.759 --> 02:18:23.395
TWO POINT THREE PERCENT.

02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:25.463
INCREASE SO THEY GOT THAT

02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:26.831
INCREASE IN ON DEMAND THEY GET

02:18:26.898 --> 02:18:29.668
A ONE POINT 7% ON TOP OF THAT

02:18:29.734 --> 02:18:31.002
SO WHEN YOU ADD THAT UP IT'S

02:18:31.069 --> 02:18:33.138
NOT JUST A 4% INCREASE OR IT'S

02:18:33.204 --> 02:18:35.140
ABOUT IT'S A FOUR POINT 005%

02:18:35.206 --> 02:18:37.308
BECAUSE IT'S THE- BUDGET YEAR.

02:18:37.375 --> 02:18:38.543
COST OF LIVING IS ON TOP OF

02:18:38.610 --> 02:18:40.845
THE- THE MONEY THEY GET FROM A

02:18:40.912 --> 02:18:43.148
CALL UP FROM THE CURRENT YEAR.

02:18:43.214 --> 02:18:44.582
THE MAKE UP CALL LIFE YOU. AND

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:46.451
LET ME TRY TO DIFFERENT WAY.

02:18:46.518 --> 02:18:48.853
THAT THAT'S HELPFUL. THAT'S

02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:52.657
DEFINITELY TRUE- IF. WE WERE

02:18:52.724 --> 02:18:56.728
PRE PLANNED- MAC. TO NILES

02:18:56.795 --> 02:18:59.330
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:18:59.397 --> 02:19:02.767
THE TWO. IN IN FUNDING THERE

02:19:02.834 --> 02:19:04.102
WAS A CUT OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT

02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:05.570
AND THEN IT CAME BACK TWO OR

02:19:05.637 --> 02:19:08.807
THREE TIMES- I BELIEVE THAT

02:19:08.873 --> 02:19:10.809
THERE'S AN INCREASE OVER THE

02:19:10.875 --> 02:19:12.343
PRE PLANNED- MAKE FUNDING

02:19:12.410 --> 02:19:14.713
WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THAT

02:19:14.779 --> 02:19:20.852
INCREASE. SO LEADING- SORT OF

02:19:20.919 --> 02:19:23.455
TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS- FLAT

02:19:23.521 --> 02:19:25.323
THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC CUTS TO

02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:26.591
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUDGET

02:19:26.658 --> 02:19:28.460
THERE WAS A- POST. PRODUCTION

02:19:28.526 --> 02:19:30.328
AND- WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED WAS

02:19:30.395 --> 02:19:31.696
THAT SHOULD BE AN APARTMENT FOR

02:19:31.763 --> 02:19:33.998
ALL. SO FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE A

02:19:34.065 --> 02:19:36.067
PORTION THERE WILL BE. A

02:19:36.134 --> 02:19:37.035
COMPARATIVE PREPAID DEBIT

02:19:37.102 --> 02:19:40.138
CALLS. IT A FOUR POINT 005%

02:19:40.205 --> 02:19:42.040
INCREASE OVER THE PREPAID DEBIT

02:19:42.107 --> 02:19:44.075
BUBBLES. PERFECT THAT'S WHAT I

02:19:44.142 --> 02:19:46.111
WAS LOOKING FOR THANK YOU I

02:19:46.177 --> 02:19:48.113
APPRECIATE THAT. AND THEN LET

02:19:48.179 --> 02:19:51.549
ME ASK- ONCE AGAIN FINANCE.

02:19:51.616 --> 02:19:53.585
WHILE WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT

02:19:53.651 --> 02:19:58.456
THE INCREASE- IN THE COLA.

02:19:58.523 --> 02:20:00.391
THERE'S CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS

02:20:00.458 --> 02:20:02.560
THAT. HELP SUPPORT STUDENTS

02:20:02.627 --> 02:20:04.996
MASSA POINT TO A PART TIME

02:20:05.063 --> 02:20:07.432
FACULTY OFFICE HOURS. NONE OF

02:20:07.499 --> 02:20:09.968
THOSE RECEIVED A COLA. R. R.

02:20:10.034 --> 02:20:15.507
CAN YOU SAY. WHY THEY DIDN'T

02:20:15.573 --> 02:20:17.675
RECEIVE A CALL. SURE WHILE THE

02:20:17.742 --> 02:20:19.244
ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZED THAT

02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:20.245
THESE CHEMICALS TO PROVIDE

02:20:20.311 --> 02:20:23.114
IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:25.483
TO STUDENTS- DOCTOR LIVING

02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:26.918
ADJUSTMENTS WERE PROVIDED TO

02:20:26.985 --> 02:20:27.886
THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE

02:20:27.952 --> 02:20:28.920
TYPICALLY RECEIVED A COST OF

02:20:28.987 --> 02:20:30.889
LIVING ADJUSTMENT. AND BUDGET

02:20:30.955 --> 02:20:33.024
HISTORICALLY SO WE SIMPLY

02:20:33.091 --> 02:20:34.225
CONTINUE THAT PRACTICE OF

02:20:34.292 --> 02:20:35.126
PROVIDING COUNSELING

02:20:35.193 --> 02:20:38.062
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAMS

02:20:38.129 --> 02:20:40.098
THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY RECYCLE.

02:20:40.165 --> 02:20:42.700
AT LEAST THAT'S THE CONSISTENT

02:20:42.767 --> 02:20:43.301
WITH THE ANSWER THAT I GOT IN

02:20:43.368 --> 02:20:46.304
FEBRUARY. EXCEPT I DIDN'T LIKE

02:20:46.371 --> 02:20:49.240
IT THAT. AND IT JUST SEEMS TO

02:20:49.307 --> 02:20:51.376
ME THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY

02:20:51.442 --> 02:20:52.977
DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT IN THE PAST

02:20:53.044 --> 02:20:54.412
THERE CONTINUED TO BE PENALIZED

02:20:54.479 --> 02:20:57.081
BECAUSE THEY GIVE GOOD SERVICES

02:20:57.148 --> 02:20:59.150
AND VALUABLE SERVICES SO I HOPE

02:20:59.217 --> 02:21:01.719
THAT. THAT WE CAN LOOK AT COST

02:21:01.786 --> 02:21:03.221
OF LIVING INCREASES FOR

02:21:03.288 --> 02:21:04.856
EVERYONE AND NOT JUST BECAUSE

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:06.124
THERE WEREWINNERS AND LOSERS

02:21:06.191 --> 02:21:08.459
HISTORICALLY THE LOSERS. ARE

02:21:08.526 --> 02:21:13.731
CONTINUE THE NAME OF LASTLY-

02:21:13.798 --> 02:21:15.834
THE COMMON COURSE NUMBER RING

02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:19.070
IT WAS MENTIONED IN PASSING IN.

02:21:19.137 --> 02:21:21.139
WHAT'S THE VALUE WHAT WHAT

02:21:21.206 --> 02:21:22.640
WHAT'S THE GAIN IN SPENDING

02:21:22.707 --> 02:21:24.843
THIS AS OPPOSED TO SOMEWHERE

02:21:24.909 --> 02:21:28.813
ELSE IN THE AREA. IN THE SYSTEM.

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:30.748
AND I GUESS I SHOULD START WITH

02:21:30.815 --> 02:21:36.487
A FINANCING. SURE SO I CAN

02:21:36.554 --> 02:21:37.589
CLOSE BY THAT CURRENTLY THERE

02:21:37.655 --> 02:21:39.390
ARE DISPARATE NUMBERING SYSTEMS

02:21:39.457 --> 02:21:40.458
ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN SOME

02:21:40.525 --> 02:21:41.259
WORK IN THE TERRIERS ARE JUST

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:43.294
REMEMBERING SYSTEMS FOR COURSES

02:21:43.361 --> 02:21:45.163
ACROSS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:21:45.230 --> 02:21:48.132
SYSTEM. SO BY CREATING A COMMON

02:21:48.199 --> 02:21:49.033
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM WE

02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:51.402
CANNOT ON THE- MAKE IT EASIER

02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:52.604
FOR STUDENTS TO MAP OUT THEIR

02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:53.838
THEIR PATHWAY AND FIGURE OUT

02:21:53.905 --> 02:21:55.039
WHAT SORT OF COURSES THEY NEED

02:21:55.106 --> 02:21:56.741
BUT ALSO IF THEY TRANSFER TO A

02:21:56.808 --> 02:21:58.309
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR

02:21:58.376 --> 02:22:00.745
EVEN TO AC IF YOU CAN HELP

02:22:00.812 --> 02:22:02.213
CLARIFY THE PROCESS FOR THOSE

02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:03.948
STUDENTS AND- MAKE IT A MUCH

02:22:04.015 --> 02:22:05.516
MORE SIMPLE PROCESS PER PER

02:22:05.583 --> 02:22:07.085
STUDENT DATA GETTING THREE.

02:22:07.151 --> 02:22:08.486
BETWEEN A COLLEGE SYSTEM MUCH I

02:22:08.553 --> 02:22:10.622
THINK ALIGNS WITH THE PATHWAYS

02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:12.156
AND A LOT OF WORK BEING DONE TO

02:22:12.223 --> 02:22:13.925
THE VISION FOR SUCCESS SO WE

02:22:13.992 --> 02:22:16.294
DID IT IN ONE NOW THE OVERALL

02:22:16.361 --> 02:22:18.129
EVERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS AN

02:22:18.196 --> 02:22:20.698
ARTICULATION STUDY WHICH IS

02:22:20.765 --> 02:22:22.300
BASICALLY HOW IT'S COURSES

02:22:22.367 --> 02:22:25.670
CONNECT IN TRANSFER ABILITY IS

02:22:25.737 --> 02:22:27.772
SIX EXPECTED IF YOU DID COMMON

02:22:27.839 --> 02:22:31.042
COURSE NUMBER ON. THAT IT TAKES

02:22:31.109 --> 02:22:38.383
AWAY A BUNCH OF THE NEED TO DO.

02:22:38.449 --> 02:22:38.950
A LOT OF BRICK ARTICULATION

02:22:39.017 --> 02:22:40.718
STUDIES. AND MAY. THIS MAYBE

02:22:40.785 --> 02:22:42.887
ALL. A DAN AND GO IT WAS A ON

02:22:42.954 --> 02:22:45.690
THIS ONE. FESTA HAPPY TO ADD ON

02:22:45.757 --> 02:22:48.159
THIS- CORE COMMON COURSE

02:22:48.226 --> 02:22:50.028
NUMBERING SYSTEM WOULD ALLOW

02:22:50.094 --> 02:22:53.831
STUDENTS AND- ANY INSTITUTION

02:22:53.898 --> 02:22:55.033
WHERE STUDENTS TAKES THAT

02:22:55.099 --> 02:22:59.070
COURSE ON TO KNOW WHAT. WHAT

02:22:59.137 --> 02:23:00.038
THEY'VE LEARNED WITHIN THAT

02:23:00.104 --> 02:23:02.840
COURSE AND SO A PHYSICS CLASS

02:23:02.907 --> 02:23:05.643
IN ONE DISTRICT IS- WITH THE

02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:07.679
SAME NUMBER THAT CAN BE

02:23:07.745 --> 02:23:08.780
EXPECTED TO HAVE THE SAME

02:23:08.846 --> 02:23:11.649
LEARNING OUTCOMES AS A PHYSICS

02:23:11.716 --> 02:23:12.850
CLASS IN ANOTHER. AT ANOTHER

02:23:12.917 --> 02:23:15.420
DISTRICT THAT'S THE BENEFIT IT

02:23:15.486 --> 02:23:17.689
ALSO EASES CONFUSION FROM A

02:23:17.755 --> 02:23:19.424
STUDENT- ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:21.259
CHALLENGES ME SCENE AND SOME OF

02:23:21.326 --> 02:23:22.427
OUR COMPLETION EFFORTS IS THAT

02:23:22.493 --> 02:23:25.396
STUDENTS HAVE. AN AVERAGE OF

02:23:25.463 --> 02:23:27.198
NINETY UNITS TO COMPLETE AN

02:23:27.265 --> 02:23:28.566
ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE WHICH SHOULD

02:23:28.633 --> 02:23:31.135
REQUIRE SIXTY UNITS OFTEN THIS

02:23:31.202 --> 02:23:32.804
IS BECAUSE THEY TAKE CLASSES

02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:34.672
THAT WERE REDUNDANT OR THEY

02:23:34.739 --> 02:23:36.441
ULTIMATELY DID. SO YOU'RE

02:23:36.507 --> 02:23:37.775
SAYING THAT COURSE RING NUMBER

02:23:37.842 --> 02:23:39.544
RANG WITH ELIMINATE PEOPLE

02:23:39.610 --> 02:23:41.612
TAKING RETURNED CLASSES IS THAT

02:23:41.679 --> 02:23:44.916
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THAT'S ONE

02:23:44.983 --> 02:23:48.987
OF THE BENEFITS YES. HELLO

02:23:49.053 --> 02:23:51.022
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION SO ON

02:23:51.089 --> 02:23:53.324
THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER

02:23:53.391 --> 02:23:56.594
OTHER SENATORS ANY QUESTIONS.

02:23:56.661 --> 02:23:59.731
US SENATOR MAN. I JUST HAD A

02:23:59.797 --> 02:24:02.567
COMMENT I WANTED TO- ECHOED THE

02:24:02.634 --> 02:24:04.102
COMMENTS OF THE CCC

02:24:04.168 --> 02:24:06.704
REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT THE ONLINE

02:24:06.771 --> 02:24:08.773
LEARNING REQUIREMENT- PRIOR TO

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.908
THE PANDEMIC HI I DON'T PRETEND

02:24:10.975 --> 02:24:12.477
TO BE FULLY STEEPED IN D.

02:24:12.543 --> 02:24:14.479
PEDAGOGICAL RESEARCH OUT THERE

02:24:14.545 --> 02:24:16.814
BUT- I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY

02:24:16.881 --> 02:24:18.649
THE CONSENSUS IS THAT THERE ARE

02:24:18.716 --> 02:24:19.951
DRASTIC DIFFERENCES IN THE

02:24:20.018 --> 02:24:22.020
QUALITY AND OUTCOMES BETWEEN IN

02:24:22.086 --> 02:24:24.322
PERSON INSTRUCTION. AND ONLINE

02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:26.391
LEARNING AND WE'VE JUST GONE

02:24:26.457 --> 02:24:28.026
THROUGH A YEAR AND A HALF LONG

02:24:28.092 --> 02:24:28.960
ALMOST YEAR AND A HALF LONG

02:24:29.027 --> 02:24:30.728
EXPERIMENT WITH A LOT OF DATA

02:24:30.795 --> 02:24:33.064
POINTS- AND I AND I THINK AT

02:24:33.131 --> 02:24:34.932
THIS POINT IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE

02:24:34.999 --> 02:24:37.535
RAFTS TO BE REQUIRING A 10%

02:24:37.602 --> 02:24:39.570
INCREASE IN ONLINE LEARNING.

02:24:39.637 --> 02:24:41.839
WHEN IT THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT

02:24:41.906 --> 02:24:43.041
THAT'S UNFAIR AND WE'RE ABOUT

02:24:43.107 --> 02:24:44.609
TO GET A LOT MORE DATA ANALYZED

02:24:44.675 --> 02:24:46.577
TO THAT EFFECT SO I WOULD

02:24:46.644 --> 02:24:48.579
SUGGEST THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER

02:24:48.646 --> 02:24:49.881
POLICY PATHWAY TO CONSIDER

02:24:49.947 --> 02:24:52.183
HOLDING OFF ON THAT RATHER THAN

02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:53.651
CREATING A WHAT IS BEEN

02:24:53.718 --> 02:24:55.186
DESCRIBED AS AN ARBITRARY

02:24:55.253 --> 02:24:56.387
PERCENTAGE NUMBER THAT DOESN'T

02:24:56.454 --> 02:24:58.523
SEEM TO HAVE A VERY STRONG

02:24:58.589 --> 02:25:01.993
POLICY BASIS BUT- THAT'S JUST

02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:02.827
MY TWO CENTS. THANK YOU. THANK

02:25:02.894 --> 02:25:05.963
YOU MAN SINGH NO OTHER

02:25:06.030 --> 02:25:09.634
QUESTIONS- LET ME MAKE SORT OF

02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:12.036
A CLOSING COMMENT BECAUSE ONCE

02:25:12.103 --> 02:25:13.571
AGAIN THERE'S A LEVEL OF

02:25:13.638 --> 02:25:15.440
COMPLEXITY IN THIS BUDGET TO

02:25:15.506 --> 02:25:18.876
THAT OUR TIME DID NOT ALLOW US

02:25:18.943 --> 02:25:21.345
TO FULLY EXPLORE TODAY- BECAUSE

02:25:21.412 --> 02:25:23.948
I THINK. APPRECIATED THE

02:25:24.015 --> 02:25:27.185
EXPLANATION ABOUT THE- THE

02:25:27.251 --> 02:25:29.487
COLON YOUR HERE. PURCHASE THE

02:25:29.554 --> 02:25:30.788
FACT THAT THE DEFERRALS ARE

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:32.123
PAID OFF HERE BUT FOR SOME

02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:34.125
REASON THEY'RE NOT PAID OFF IN

02:25:34.192 --> 02:25:37.195
K. THROUGH TWELVE- AND THE

02:25:37.261 --> 02:25:39.230
THERE ARE SOME ONGOING ISSUES

02:25:39.297 --> 02:25:40.665
WANT TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS

02:25:40.731 --> 02:25:42.366
ABOUT TO CALL US FOR CERTAIN

02:25:42.433 --> 02:25:45.536
PROGRAMS. AND I THINK EVEN

02:25:45.603 --> 02:25:46.871
THOUGH IT'S NOT BEING ADDRESSED

02:25:46.938 --> 02:25:48.406
IN THIS BUDGET IT DOESN'T TAKE

02:25:48.473 --> 02:25:50.475
AWAY FROM A COUPLE OF ISSUES

02:25:50.541 --> 02:25:52.677
THAT WE WANT TO. AN ON GOING

02:25:52.743 --> 02:25:54.645
BASIS AND MAYBE NEXT YEAR LOOK

02:25:54.712 --> 02:25:57.849
AT WHICH IS. THE HISTORIC-

02:25:57.915 --> 02:25:59.650
ATTEMPT OVER THIRTY YEARS TO

02:25:59.717 --> 02:26:01.185
CHANGE THE FULL TIME PART TIME

02:26:01.252 --> 02:26:03.187
PERCENTAGE. AND ALSO THE

02:26:03.254 --> 02:26:05.456
FORMULA WE ARE NOT ADDRESSING

02:26:05.523 --> 02:26:08.025
THE FORMULA WE HAVE A TWO YEAR.

02:26:08.092 --> 02:26:10.261
HOLD HARMLESS STILL IN PLACE

02:26:10.328 --> 02:26:11.329
BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF

02:26:11.395 --> 02:26:13.264
DISTRICTS GO OVER FINANCIAL

02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:14.999
CLIFF IN TWO YEARS IF WE DON'T

02:26:15.066 --> 02:26:18.069
REVISE THAT. IT WAS MY HOPE

02:26:18.136 --> 02:26:20.037
THAT THAT WE LOOK AT THAT IN A

02:26:20.104 --> 02:26:23.407
MORE PERMANENT FIX. I KNOW

02:26:23.474 --> 02:26:26.244
THERE'S A CONTRACT WITH A

02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:28.513
CONSULTING FIRM TO LOOK AT THE

02:26:28.579 --> 02:26:30.848
OVERALL FORMULA RATHER THAN

02:26:30.915 --> 02:26:33.885
JOSH. I'D TRIED TO FIX IT FOR

02:26:33.951 --> 02:26:36.187
THE WINDSORS AND HOLD HARMLESS

02:26:36.254 --> 02:26:38.256
AN ON GOING BASIS SO MAYBE.

02:26:38.322 --> 02:26:40.191
THAT CONSULTING WORK WILL HELP

02:26:40.258 --> 02:26:42.560
US GOING INTO NEXT YEAR BUT

02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:43.794
THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT JUST

02:26:43.861 --> 02:26:45.129
ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE

02:26:45.196 --> 02:26:46.631
ADDRESSED WE JUST CAN'T KEEP

02:26:46.697 --> 02:26:48.199
KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD

02:26:48.266 --> 02:26:50.434
AND WHILE WE'RE KICKING THE CAN

02:26:50.501 --> 02:26:51.335
DOWN THE ROAD BECAUSE IT WAS

02:26:51.402 --> 02:26:54.238
PRE DECIDED FOR TWO MORE YEARS.

02:26:54.305 --> 02:26:56.374
TO DO THE HOLD HARMLESS- I

02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:57.875
THINK THAT NEXT YEAR WE HAVE TO

02:26:57.942 --> 02:26:58.876
FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESS THAT

02:26:58.943 --> 02:27:01.179
ISSUE AND BY CALLING IT OUT NOW

02:27:01.245 --> 02:27:02.747
NOBODY WILL BE SURPRISED OVER

02:27:02.813 --> 02:27:03.948
THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AND WE

02:27:04.015 --> 02:27:06.651
TALK ABOUT IT IN. AND TRY TO

02:27:06.717 --> 02:27:09.253
GET THERE. BUT WITH THAT. ARE

THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY TAILORED

02:38:12.316 --> 02:38:13.417
SPECIFICALLY TO DISPLACED

02:38:13.483 --> 02:38:15.652

02:38:15.719 --> 02:38:17.387
NOT CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN AN

02:38:20.490 --> 02:38:22.526
TO BETTER ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS

02:38:22.593 --> 02:38:23.594

OUT QUICKLY. THAT'S NOT THE WAY

02:38:38.842 --> 02:38:40.010
TO DO IT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:38:40.077 --> 02:38:41.345
ACTUALLY DO THAT IMMEDIATELY

02:38:41.411 --> 02:38:43.280

EFFECTIVE TO USE EXISTING

02:38:47.951 --> 02:38:49.553

02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:50.754
STUDENTS AND WORKERS ARE AWARE

02:38:50.821 --> 02:38:52.923

02:39:04.801 --> 02:39:07.004

02:44:10.941 --> 02:44:11.441
