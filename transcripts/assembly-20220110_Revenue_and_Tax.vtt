THAT TAKE UP RATE ACTUALLY

01:32:24.772 --> 01:32:26.874
BECAUSE- LOCAL BUSINESSES HAVE

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:28.876
TROUBLE FIGURING OUT WHO LOCAL

01:32:28.943 --> 01:32:30.711

SOME OF MY CONCERNS- WITH REGARD

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:04.069
TO IT BEING ESSENTIALLY LIKE AN

02:09:04.136 --> 02:09:05.804
ACTUAL HOLIDAY INVOLVING A

YEAR LEADING TO THE SCHOOL YEAR

02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:13.779
AND- CERTAINLY THE NEED FOR

02:09:13.846 --> 02:09:16.048
SCHOOL SUPPLIES IS A YEAR ROUND

02:09:16.115 --> 02:09:18.250

THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO THE

02:09:24.690 --> 02:09:26.892
YEARS WHY I'D HAVE CONCERNS

02:09:26.959 --> 02:09:27.926

MORTAR BUSINESSES IN THEIR

02:09:41.473 --> 02:09:42.541
COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT THEM THAT

02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:46.044

02:09:59.124 --> 02:10:00.459
THE FUTURE SO. WITH THOSE

02:10:00.526 --> 02:10:02.294
CONCERNS AND ALSO KNOWING THAT A

02:10:02.361 --> 02:10:03.829
COMPUTER COULD BREAK A PRINTER

02:10:03.896 --> 02:10:04.963
