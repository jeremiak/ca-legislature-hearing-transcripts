THIS BILL FOCUS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEETINGS SIDERITE CASKEY THE FLOOR'S YOURS IN GOOD THURSDAY MORNING TO YOU. THANK YOU OUT MISTER ARCHER AND THINK FOR THE ACCOMMODATION AND SB TWO SEVENTY FOUR WHILE SIMPLE IS A VERY IMPORTANT- MEASURE BECAUSE IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. TO BE INFORMED ABOUT THE ACTIONS AT THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE TAKING AND ALSO ALLOW SOME TIME TO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS. THIS IS THE PROBLEM AND NOT SHALL THE BROWN ACT WHICH WEALL. HAIL IS A GREAT ACT ONLY REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SMALE AGENDA PACKETS OUT TO THE PUBLIC. IF THEY REQUESTED IT HAS TO BE THE SNAIL MAIL. THAT LEADS TO SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH WELL DOCUMENTED TO. POSTAL SERVICES HAVING. A LITTLE BIT OF TIME GETTING THE MAIL DELIVERED IN A IN A SPEEDY WAY SOMETIMES- OF. THE MAIL THE PACKETS ARE DELIVERED AFTER THE MEETINGS CONCLUDED. AND ALSO SOME JURISDICTIONS ALL REQUIRE CERTIFIED MAIL SO THAT THE THAT MEANS THAT THE REQUESTER HAS TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT TO SIGN FOR THE MAIL. WHEN IT'S RECEIVED. BY THEM. WHAT WHAT'S EFFECTIVE. SOMETIMES IT PUSHES THE DELIVERY DATE OUT EVEN FURTHER WHICH MEANS THAT THEY- THEY MISTOOK PICKED OUT. THE AGENDA AND ALSO- THE REQUESTED MAYBE HAVE SCHOOL AND WORK AND OTHER THINGS THIS IS NOT CONVENIENT. AND LASTLY A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ABLE TO CHARGE THIS. A SERVICE CHARGE FOR THIS ORIGINAL. PRINT XEROXING AND- AND MAILING AND THAT'S SORT OF AN UNNECESSARY BURDEN WHEN YOU CONSIDERING THAT THERE'S A QUICKER AND CHEAPER WAY. TO DELIVER THESE PACKETS AND THAT'S BY EMAIL% SAID THE BILL BASICALLY THAT SAYS IS THAT. ALLOWS PEOPLE OF THE WATER REQUEST AN EMAIL DELIVERY OF THE PACKETS.

FOR CLAIMS AGAINST WATER AND SEWER AGENCY RATE ADJUSTMENTS WATER AND SEWER UTILITY BUDGETS ARE FUNDED BY REVENUE COLLECTED THROUGH SERVICE RATES THESE RATES PROVIDE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO SUPPLY SAFE DRINKING WATER UPGRADE AND IMPROVE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY EXISTING LAW ALLOWS LAWSUITS THAT SEEK REFUNDS OR SEEKS TO INVALIDATE EXISTING RATE STRUCTURES YEARS AFTER RATES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AND COLLECTED AND QUITE QUITE FRANKLY DELAYED LAWSUITS CAN THREATEN AND AGENCIES ABILITY TO REPAY DEBT GUARANTEED BY REVENUE FROM RATES. IT CAN ALSO DERAIL ON GROWING ONGOING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND GENERALLY UNDERMINE AND ABILITIES AND AGENCIES ABILITY TO MAINTAIN STABLE BUDGETS NECESSARY TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LEGAL CHALLENGES FILED AGAINST WATER AND SEWER RATE AGENCY RATE STRUCTURES AND FOR SOME OF THE AGENCY SUED THE CHALLENGE. RATES WERE ADOPTED FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO THE LOS. AND NOW WITH THE ADDITION STRAIN THE GOVERNOR A-ORDER PROHIBITING WATER SHUT OFFS REGARDLESS OF A CUSTOMER'S ABILITY TO PAY WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES ARE UNDER CONSTANT FINANCIAL STRAIN AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE AT RISK. SB THREE TWENTY THREE ADDS CONSISTENCY TO EXISTING LAW BY AUTHORIZING A LOCAL AGENCY OR INTERESTED PERSON TO BRING A VALIDATION ACTION IN SUPERIOR COURT TO DETERMINE THE VALIDITY OF A FEE OR CHARGE FOR WATER AND SEWER SERVICE. IF A VALIDATION ACTION IS NOT BROUGHT WITHIN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS PARTIES WOULD BE BARRED FROM CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE FEE. FOR THE CHARGE. THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING PRECEDENT. MODELED AFTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOR MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC RATE FOR CHARGES BY ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO BRING CHALLENGES WITHIN A REASONABLE BUT LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BALANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE REPAIRS WITH THOSE OF PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

A PUBLIC RETAIL WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES SERVING CENTRAL ORANGE COUNTY. TO SYSTEM YOUR CONSIDERATION FOR SB THREE TWO THREE OF LIKE TO DESCRIBE THE VERY PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS. OF RESETTING THAT WE USE AT OUR W. D. PROP TO RETURN REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ARE EXPENSIVE BUT THEY ARE ONLY PART OF OUR- PUBLIC PROCESS. LIKE ALL WATER AND WASTE WATER AGENCIES HIGHER W. D. BEGINS ITS RATE SETTING PROCESS WITH THE COST OF SERVICE STUDY. THE DETAILED STUDY EXPLAINS A METHODOLOGY FOR HOW RATES ARE SET. AND HOW COSTS ARE ALLOCATED. AMONG OUR CUSTOMERS. BECAUSE OF PROP TWO EIGHTEEN STRICT COST OF SERVICE PRINCIPLES RATE SETTING IS TIED DIRECTLY TO AN AGENCY BUDGET. AND THAT IS WHERE WE PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR THE PROPOSED RATES. HIGHER TO BE EXPLAINS. RIGHT POLICY DECISIONS EXPENSES PROPOSED RATES IN IMPACTS. AT MULTIPLE PUBLIC MEETINGS AT SETTING PROCESS. PRIOR TO BEING CONSIDERED FOR ADOPTION BY OUR BOARD. WE ALSO MAILED EACH PROPERTY OWNER AND CUSTOMER A PROP TO EIGHTEEN NOTICE.

GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSOR OF CPAC SPEECH THREE TWO THREE. I JUST WANT TO START BY- THANKING THE SENATOR PROP DURING THIS BILL. WHEN I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE TIME AND ATTENTION TO THOSE ALSO PROVIDED THE BILL SH. THREE TWO THREE IS NOT A NEW OR REVOLUTIONARY IDEA THIS BILL LINES WITH LONGSTANDING PRESIDENT IN THE- INBOX HUNDRED TWENTY DAY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. UNDER MENTIONED IS ALREADY PROVIDED FOR MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC RATES CONNECTION FEES CAPACITY CHARGES ASSESSED BY WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES. AND OTHER TYPES OF FEES AND CHARGES. THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO MINIMIZE FISCAL UNCERTAINTY FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. SB THREE TWO THREE SIX TO PROVIDE SIMILAR PROTECTIONS. FOR WATER AND SEWER SERVICE RATES. PUBLIC WATER AND A ARE LARGELY FUNDED BY RATHER MEANING LEGAL CHAO TO RAGE FROM. CAN HAVE A- THE STATE BY THE FACT. FOR PUBLIC AGING. AS A COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES POINT PROP TO EIGHTEEN HAS BEEN FERTILE GROUND FOR LITIGATION THE RECENT CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST EIGHTY ONE WATER SUPPLIERS. IS THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF HOW THE BOUNDS OF CROPS TO EIGHTEEN ARE BEING TESTED. THESE LAWSUITS ALSO CUT AGAINST WATER PORTABILITY AS CUSTOMERS THAT WILL CALL ME BEAR THE COST OF LITIGATION SH I WANT TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS ISSUES PREVIOUSLY RAISED TO THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW THIS BILL WOULD IMPACT YOUR CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO CHALLENGE AN AGE. RANGE FACTOR PROP TO EIGHTEEN AS YOU JUST HEARD REQUIRES PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES TO PROVIDE ROBUST PUBLIC AND- INVOLVEMENT. PRIOR TO ADOPTING RATES THIS INCLUDES MAILING NOTICES TO ALL AFFECTED PARCELS PUBLIC HEARINGS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO PROTEST THE RATE CHANGE AND MORE. HE NEEDS TO TRAIN MANDATE DO NOT APPLY TO THE FEES AND CHARGES THAT ALREADY RECEIVE THE PROTECTIONOF A. HUNDRED TWENTY DATES THAT SHOULD LIMITATION. WE NEED A ROBUST TRANSPARENCY REQUIRED AND THE FACT THAT CUSTOMERS WOULD STILL HAVE. THE CHALLENGE THE RATE AFTER THEY GO INTO A- SB THREE TWO THREE WITH STILL GET CUSTOMERS AMPLE TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO INCLUDE THEIR VOICE IN THE RATE SETTING PROCESS. L. STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO RATE PAYERS. ALIGN PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES TO AVOID UNNECESSARY FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY THIRTY SECOND REASON YOUR PASTOR I VOTE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

THAT COULD MORE MEMBERS- AT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE RETAILERS WITH ONLINE SALES TOTALING MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO REPORT TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. THE CITY OR ZIP CODE OF THE PURCHASERS. FOR ALL TAXABLE SALES TRANSACTIONS ONLINE. THIS BILL IS A TRANSPARENCY MEASURE. DESIGNED TO SHED LIGHT ON THE BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORM LOCAL SALES TAX LAW. UNDER BRADLEY BURNS SALES TAX REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE POINT OF SALE. FOR BRICK AND MORTAR STORES THIS MEANS ALLOCATING THE REVENUE TO THE JURISDICTION THE STORE IS LOCATED IN. POND LINE RETAILERS HOWEVER HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY ALLOCATE SALES TAX REVENUE. BE THAT A WAREHOUSE DISTRIBUTION CENTER OR SALES OFFICE. THIS ALLOWS CORPORATIONS TO DIRECT REVENUES TO A SINGLE JURISDICTION IN THE STATE. THREAD ALLOWS CORPORATIONS TO DIRECT THE REVENUE FROM ONLINE SALES TO ONE SINGLE DESTINATION IN THE STATE. CORPORATIONS USE THIS AS LEVERAGE WHEN NEGOTIATING WHERE TO LOCATE WITHIN THE STATE. WHAT RESULTS IS A RIGGED PROCESS DRIVING CITIES TO ACCEPT INCREASINGLY ONEROUS TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS IN AN EXCHANGE FOR ONLINE RETAILERS SENDING ALL OF THE SALES TAXES THAT THEY COLLECT IN CALIFORNIA. TO THAT SINGLE JURISDICTION. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS PRIVATE COMPANIES PROFITABLE FROM THEIR ONLINE SALES. AND FROM SALES TAX KICKBACKS. OFTEN CITIES WILL GIVE THESE COMPANIES BETWEEN FIFTY AND 85% OF THE SALES TAX REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THAT JURISDICTION'S 5285% THESE COMPANIES BENEFIT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC. AT A TIME WHEN ONLINE SHOPPING IS AT ITS PEAK. AND CITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND PUBLIC PROGRAMS TO COPE WITH NINETEEN. BUT ARE SIPHONING BILLIONS BILLIONS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS. FURTHER WHEN THESE DEALS ARE OFTEN TOUTED FOR CREATING JOBS AND HAVING SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS THE GAINS ARE DOUBTFUL. SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE THAT THE PROMISED JOBS ARE EVER CREATED EVEN WHEN THEY DO. THE JOBS COUNTED ARC HAS CREATED IN ONE CITY ARE USUALLY JUST BEING TRANSFERRED FROM ONE CITY TO ANOTHER. ADDITIONALLY THESE AGREEMENTS CAN ACTUALLY FURTHER ECONOMIC INEQUALITY. AS CITIES THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENTS OFTEN DO SO. AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR SIMILARLY SITUATED NEIGHBORS. CALIFORNIA DESERVES TO KNOW HOW MUCH REVENUE THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS OR SAY PUTTING FROM OTHER CITIES FOR THESE REASONS SB SEVEN NINETY TWO. WOULD REQUIRE RETAILERS THAT PROVIDE THE DESTINATION DATA OF ALL THEIR TAXABLE SALES THAT'S TRANSACTED ONLINE THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES IS TRANSPARENCY SO WE CAN EXAMINE IT ONCE MORE CLOSELY. TO SEE HOW THESE TAX SHIFTS ARE WORKING. FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT OR AGAINST THE PUBLIC BENEFIT AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IPHONE. YOU SO MUCH AS GLAZER WE'RE GOING NOW TO GO TO THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN NINETY TWO WE DO NOT HAVE A LEAD SUPPORT OF WEAKNESS ON. FILE OR RECORD HERE TODAY SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA GO STRAIGHT TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO TO OUR TELECONFERENCE LINE. SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK BROUGH TWENTY FORTY. BROUGH TWENTY FORTY IS AS COLD AS IT IS HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OF THREE BUT IT'S LONELIER. SO AT LEAST WE HAVE WARM HEARTS HERE AM I RIGHT TERRORISM. SANDRA THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO OUR TELECONFERENCE LINE THAT WE'RE GONNA ASK IT IS IT SEE IF THERE ARE ANY FOLKS WHO LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN NINETY TWO NOT A MODERATOR IF WE CAN QUEUE UP THOSE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN. NINE TWO. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN NINE TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND I CURRENTLY HAVE ONE LINE IN Q. FORTY ONE FORTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. I AM CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE NICK ROMANO WOULD TELL ME TO CALIFORNIA. I'M CALLING YOU TODAY WE DO NOT YET HAVE A POSITION ON THIS MATTER MEASURE- I'M TRYING IN A THIS SECTION- TO RECOGNIZE THAT SEVEN NINETY TWO SURELY IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH. CITY MANAGERS IN THE LEAGUE CALIFORNIA CITIES RECOMMENDATION TO COLLECT MORE INFORMATION FROM OTHER ABLE TO HAVE INFORMED DISCUSSION AND THE DECISION MAKING AROUND ALLOCATION SALES TAX IN A MORE EQUITABLE MANNER I'M CONSIDERING BOB CITIES HAVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND CITIES OF ALL OF ALL KINDS AND- WHAT WITHOUT POSITION THE BILL IN INSTALLMENTS THIRTY MOVING CORD- A DISCUSSION THAT WE% CAN'T- IS REASONABLE AND NECESSARY. SO HOPING TO KEEP THIS MEASURE MOVING AND WE CONTINUE TO COME BACK AND DISCUSS- WITH THE LEGISLATURE ARE WHAT THE OUR CITY LEADERS ARTICLE. THANK YOU THE REMOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD HERE VOICE WE'RE GONNA PUT YOU AS A LEAD WITNESS IN THE SQUISHY CATEGORY- IN WILL STILL BE WORKING WITH AT THE GOOD SENATOR ON THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH I ALSO DID LEAGUE CITIES FOR ALL THEIR WORK.

WE THOUGHT FRANKLY AFTER AFTER SB FIVE THIRTY ONE IN THE GOVERNOR'S VETO OF SB FIVE THIRTY ONE AND IN THE SAME YEAR THE SIGNATURE OF AB FORTY FIVE BY MR. MEDINA WHICH CREATED TRANSPARENCY PROCESS AROUND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WE REALLY THOUGHT THIS ISSUE WAS. APPROPRIATELY POSITIONS SO THERE WOULD BE PLENTY OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS. THAT THE SENATOR IS CONCERNED ABOUT AND THEN THERE FOR THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE IN ANY WAY THAT THEY THEY NEEDED TO IN THOSE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE SURE THAT THERE WERE BENEFITS BEING GIVEN. THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY IS A REQUIREMENT ON ALL RETAILERS WITH OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN IN ONLINE SALES AND FRANKLY FOR OUR FOR OUR ASSOCIATION THAT'S VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR MEMBERS WHETHER WE HAVE. A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WERE NOT. SO WE SEE THIS AS ANOTHER PIZZA YOU KNOW IT'S ANOTHER ELEMENT O REPORTING THAT WE NEED TO DO ON TOP OF THE REPORTING WE ALREADY DO THE DEPARTMENT TAXES VIA FORTY.

SO DEPENDENT ON SALES TAXES AND NOT JUST CITIES BUT OTHER ENTITIES AROUND THE STATE.

THIS STUFF BUT JUST CREATE A FREEZE FOR NO MORE NEW DEALS NOT EVEN. REVERSING THE OTHERS THE OLD ONES- IT UNFORTUNATELY- THAT BILL WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR OF WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE. WAS GONNA HURT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE TOWNS THAT MADE THESE DEALS. AND- YEAH IT IS I WANT TO HAVE THAT DEBATE AGAIN BUT I WANT TO HAVE IT ON A PLANE THAT HAS THE FAX AND THE FACTS IS WHO'S WINNING AND WHO'S LOSING AND OUR CALCULATIONS ARE ABOUT 5% OF OUR CITIES ARE WINNING AT SOME LEVEL AND 95% ARE LOSERS THIS BILL IF IT PASSES IS GOING TO REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHO ARE THE WINNERS ANDLOSERS AND THAT'S WHAT. MY FRIENDS ON THE RETAILER SO I DON'T WANT THE PUBLIC TO SEE AND FOR US TO SEE IF POLICY MAKERS ARE THESE AGREEMENTS WORKING OR NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S ON THE TABLE NOR IS EVEN A FREEZE WHICH WAS ON THE TABLE LAST YEAR IN IN THIS COMMITTEE OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED.

MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR MCGUIRE HI REQUIRED. BY SENATOR NIELSEN. ALSO IN NO SENATOR DO. DORADO FIVE SEVEN HERTZBERG. SENATOR WIENER WIENER HI THREE ONE SEVEN CURRENTLY ENJOYS A THREE ONE VOTE TO AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP THEIR OPEN SOONER GLAZER AND ALLOW THE MAJORITY LEADER TO ADD ON WHEN HE COMES BACK THANK YOU CHAIR REQUIRE AND I DIVE INTOCOLLECTED TO MENTIONED OF APPRECIATION I HAVE FOR YOUR STAFF WHO WORKED ON THIS LEGISLATION WITH MY OFFICE AND WROTE THAT EXCELLENT ANALYSIS THAT YOU SAW EARLIER SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATORS NOT CALLING IN THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT FIGHT TEAM ARE AMONG THE BEST AND WE'RE. SO APPRECIATE THANK YOU FOR MAKING THAT SIR. ALL RIGHT. BUT IN GENERAL WE'RE MOVING. WE'RE MOVING TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN. THIS IS A REALLY CRITICAL BILL. FOR SENATOR LAYERS DISTRICT AND IN PARTICULAR FOR THE CITY OF ATASCADERO. BUT WE SEEN SIMILAR BILLS LIKE THIS IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE. BEFORE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SENATE EARLIER THERE ARE VERY FEW MEMBERS OF. THE LEGISLATURE TO GO TO BAT FOR THE DISTRICT. AS MUCH AS AN EARLIER DOES SIMILAR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. ON IS P. FOUR THIRTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I SHOULD PROBABLY JUST SAY I REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AFTER THAT YOU DO A BIPARTISAN SUPPORT- BUT THIS IS A DISTRICT BILL. AND IT IS FOR THE CITY OF ATASCADERO WHICH IS THIRTY FIVE IT HAS THIRTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN THE COUNTY OF SAN LUIS OBISPO. AND IT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM. BILLS THAT YOU MIGHT OF HEARD ON THE SUBJECT OF LEFTOVER ISSUES FROM REDEVELOPMENT AND THE CLOSURE OF REDEVELOPMENT. AND BASICALLY- THIS IS IT- SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT. THE CITY OF ATASCADERO. TO LAUNCH THE REDEVELOPMENT DISTRICT BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT TO. TWO THOUSAND TWO MADE LOANS TO THE REDEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. AND THEN. FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS SWEPT FOR THE STATE. ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS WAS NEVER REPAID. THE END. OF THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS REPAYING THE LOAN STEP WERE MADE FROM THE CITY IT'S A SMALL CITY THAT IS A BIG DEAL TO. TO ITS GENERAL. FUND AND- THE ISSUE IS THAT THE OF FOR. DOES WRECK. TO LONG AS HAVE BEEN FOR IN THE RIGHT DOCUMENTS. TO BE ABLE TO BE ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS FOR THE REPAYMENT AND YET. ATASCADERO TO EXPECTATION OF REPAYMENT WERE CLEARLY DOCUMENTED IN THE ORIGINAL LOAN PAPERS CONFIRMED AND RESOLUTIONS CONFIRMED IN LOAN AGREEMENTS CONFIRMED IN ADOPTED BUDGETS CONFIRMED AN ANNUAL AUDITS. CONFIRMED IN STATEMENTS OF INDEBTEDNESS. SNACK CONFIRMED IN CITY FINANCIAL PLANNING DOCUMENTS AND THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND TEN CASH PAYMENTS. BACK ON THESE LOANS SO THESE WERE CLEARLY LOANS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES SAID THAT THEY JUST DON'T RECOGNIZE THESE AS THE CORRECT DOCUMENTS TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW FOR THE REPAYMENT. THIS BILL WOULD RECOGNIZE THESE US IN FORCIBLE OBLIGATIONS TO ALLOW THE REPAYMENT AND- AS MUCH AS I SUPPORTED OTHER BILLS ON REDEVELOPMENT. THEY WERE ABOUT USING MONEY THAT WAS LEFT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT JUST CLEANING UP THE LAUNCH BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND. IT'S SPONSORED BY THE CITY OF ATASCADERO. IT'S WIDELY SUPPORTED IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY BY THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO TASK ETERNAL SCHOOL DISTRICT ATASCADERO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. WITH ME TO TESTIFY BRIEFLY IN SUPPORT TODAY IS MAYOR HEATHER MORENO WHAT THE CITY OF ATASCADERO. AND ALSO.

COMMITTEE MEETING WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING THE VICE CHAIR OF THE CHEERS BILLS LAST WE'RE GOING TO NOW TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SB FOUR NINETY ONE AND THAT CENTER NIELSEN I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE CENTER NIELSEN THIS IS NOT HIS FIRST BILL ON THE SUBJECT. BUT HE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR THAT TO BE A TO KEEP KIDS SAFE ACROSS CALIFORNIA WILL ON THIS ISSUE CENTER NIELSEN THE FLOOR IS YOURS ON A FIFTY FOUR NINETY ONE. AND ON CIGARETTE AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME 2% FROM HERE. THIS FOUR NINE ONE. WILL PROHIBIT THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION FROM ISSUING A TOBACCO LICENSE TO ONE. WHO HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF SELLING NITROUS OXIDE TO A MINOR DISTRIBUTING NITROUS OXIDE. FOR DRUG USE OR WHO HAD FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE'S RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SALE OF NITROUS OXIDE. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF EXISTING TOBACCO LICENSE IF THE LICENSE SHE HAS DISTRIBUTED NITROUS OXIDE FOR DRUG USE FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE'S RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SALE. OF NITROUS OXIDE THIS IS A- AN EMOTIONAL BILL HOW THE MEMBERSHIP THE- MAYBE THE ISSUE IS NOT AS KNOWN TO THE BROAD PUBLIC. BUT TO THE AFFECTED FAMILIES IT'S VERY WELL KNOWN AS TO OUR WITNESSES WILL ATTACHED. THIS NITROUS OXIDE. IT IS A DRUG THAT GIVES A BIG BOPPER FOR SURE. BUT IT IS VERY ADDICTIVE AND VERY DANGEROUS. NOTWITHSTANDING IT WHATEVER EXISTING LAWS WE HAVE IN PLACE. THE CANISTERS WHAT'S YOUR CALLED WEAPONS I THINK IT'S A VERY APPROPRIATE SOUNDING NAME IF YOU WILL THIS THESE WEAPONS. THEY ARE CONTINUING TO BE SOLD FOR RECREATIONAL DRUG USE MOSTLY AND TOBACCO SHOPS. BUT THE INHALING IT CAN BE EVEN FATAL AND WE HAVE WITNESSES WHO TESTIFY TO THAT IMPACT. IT ALSO THAT CAN BACK LIVE DEVELOP A FOR INDIVIDUALS. THE DANGERS THAT ARE WELL KNOWN. TO SOME BUT NOT TO ALL AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. I DO NOT ACCUSE ANY OF THE- PURVEYORS OF THIS A TOBACCO STORES OF ANY. INSIDIOUS CONSPIRACY. NOT AT ALL BUT I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S WELL ENOUGH KNOWN THE DISASTROUS IMPACTS. OF THIS. ONE OF OUR WITNESSES HERE HAD TO DATE. SUN BECAME ADDICTED. THE TORSIONAL E. SURVIVE BUT IT CERTAINLY SET THE YOUNG MAN'S LIFE BACK CONSIDERABLY. ANOTHER ONE WHO WILL TESTIFY HERE TODAY. SEPARATE EVEN MORE GREATLY DINESH. TO WHICH IS THE EMOTIONAL. IMPACT OF THIS. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT JUST A SLAP ON THE WEST RESTORE A WARNING IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO CURTAIL THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NITROUS OXIDE. SOME. AB USERS CONSUME BOXES OF THESE CANISTERS. FOR THE TEMPORARY HIGH. THE GIVES THEM. BUT THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT IT'S VERY SERIOUS. AND EVEN FATAL. SO THIS WILL HAVE. PLACE SOME RESTRAINT. ON THE WHOLESALE MARKETING. OF THESE NITROUSOXIDE WEAPONS SHORT CANISTERS. I WOULD THE EXCEPT AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS AND THEY SUGGESTED THE AMENDMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BE HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE ADOPTED MISTER CHAIRMAN. THE PRIMARY TO THE- SUMMARIZE WHERE WE'RE HEADED WE'RE HEADED TOWARDS PROTECTING THE UNKNOWING. OF THE IMPACTS. AND EVEN BY VIRTUE OF THE CONSEQUENCES HERE FOR THE SALE OF. IT'S GOING TO EDUCATE A LOT MORE. OF STORES WHO SELL THESE WEAPONS. TO REALIZE THE CONSEQUENCES AND TO RESTRAIN THEM FOR MARKETING A PRODUCT IS DANGEROUS BUSINESS NITROUS OXIDE IS. TO THE HUMAN BEING. THE WITNESSES WILL BE VICARIOUSLY COMING IN ON OUR LINE AND IF I MAY THEN THIS TO CHAIRMAN WE DO HAVE TO TWO WITNESSES BARBARA LARGE WHOSE SON BECAME ADDICTED AND SUFFERED SEVERE DAMAGE. AND THE MILEAGE- THE LIFE PARTNER. AMANDA CROSBY. SHE SUFFERED MUCH MORE GREATLY. THE LIFE COMPANION AMANDA CROSBY AND WE'RE GOOD KNOWLEDGE IN HER TODAY IF I MAY THEN WHO'S CHAIRMAN OF WE COULD HAVE THESE FOR ME WITNESSES.

MISTER CHAIR YOU WANT TO DO IT FROM UP THERE. GERMAN YOUR FIRST BILL WOULD BE S. B. E. TWELFTH. THANK YOU SO MUCH RESERVOIRS SUGAR AND MISTER RIGHT HERE I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU EACH AND EVERY YEAR AND GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE IN THE ROLE THAT YOU ARE THIS YEAR WITH GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE- BURKE. MISTER CHAIRMAN RESERVE NEED TO TELL YOU THAT WE'RE LIVING IN A PRESIDENT TIMES WITH WILDFIRES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF WILDFIRES IN THE STATE THEY'VE CHANGED. FOR LARGER MORE DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLIER THAN. THEY'VE EVER BEEN IN MODERN HISTORY. THE TWENTY TWENTY WILDFIRE SEASON BURN MORE THAN TWO FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES MAKING IT BY FAR. THE LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. EIGHT OUT OF TEN OF THE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY HAVE ALL OCCURRED IN THE PAST DECADE. THIS INCLUDES AUGUST COMPLEX FIRE. THAT BURNED ONE MILLION ACRES IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY INTERNING CALIFORNIA. MAKING IT THE STATE'S FIRST SIGNIFIERS THE TERM FOR A FIRE THAT IS BURNED. AT LEAST A MILLION ACRES OF LAND. AND WE ALL REMEMBER THE CAMPFIRE NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THAT FIRE TRAGICALLY CAUSED THE DEATHS OF EIGHTY SIX PEOPLE. DESTROYED IT NEARLY NINETEEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES. OR WHAT ABOUT THE NORTH BAY FIRE HOUSE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHERE WE LOST. DOZENS OF LIVES. IN EACH OF THE- DEVASTATING FIRES. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS RAN FOR THEIR LIVES. AND SOMETIMES IN THE DARK AT NIGHT WITH JUST THE CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK. THEY RAN FOR THEIR LIVES SCRAMBLING TO FIND ANY WAY TO ESCAPE THE ROARING FLAMES. THE WAY WE THREE TO STRATEGICALLY GROW OUR COMMUNITY SAYS NOW COME INTO QUESTION IS THE REALITY OF MY MEGA FIRES HAVE SAID IN HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. WE KNOW THAT THE SAME DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES THAT CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE IN HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS MUST CHANGE. AND IF THEY DON'T JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT IT. MORE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION WILL FOLLOW. THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS ALREADY INTERVENE WITH LAWSUITS ON THREE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE WILD IN URBAN INTERFACE BECAUSE OF THEIR WILDFIRE IMPACTS. THE NEW NORMAL CALIFORNIANS HERE AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED SB TWELVE. FIFTY TWELVE CENTS A MINIMUM FLOOR FOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. CURRENT STATE STANDARDS ARE LIMITED TO THE BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR LIKE ROADS AND SIGNS IN FUEL BREAKS. NOW WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS TO SET UP A TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS FOR THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO ESTABLISH A BOLD. NEW STANDARDS THAT ENSURE DEVELOPMENTS AS A WHOLE ARE DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND FIRE NOT JUST THE BUILDINGS WITH IN THOSE DEVELOPMENTS. SOME OF THESE NEW STANDARDS WOULD INCLUDE A WILDLAND FIRE HAZARD ASSESSMENT IN WILDFIRE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN THAT STANDARDS FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF. FIRE SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS AT THE DEVELOPMENT LOCATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO REDUCE IGNITION POTENTIAL AND ENSURE AVAILABILITY WATER SUPPLIES ESSENTIAL FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION DURING A WILDFIRE. HE COULDN'T YOU CAN NO LONGER HAVE. ONE WAY ENDING ONE YEAH YOU'D HAVE TO. MULTIPLE IN AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE WOULD BE REQUIRED. MANAGEMENT AND FUEL MODIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND THEN THERE WOULD BE AN ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED AND IT WOULD ALL BE FUNDED IN AND OUT AND IMPLEMENTED TO VERIFY ON GOING COMPLIANCE. BACK BY FINANCING MECHANISMS LIKE ASSESSMENTS ON H. AWAY FUNDS THAT ARE A CONDITION ON THE DEVELOPMENT. WE WOULD LOOK TO SITE SPECIFIC SAFETY MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WHOLE IS PLANNING CONSTRUCTED TO REDUCE THEIR ENCROACHMENT OF UNCONTROLLED FIRE IN. A DEVELOPMENT LAY OUT THAT REDUCES WILDFIRE RISK TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PART PRACTICAL. BUT BLUNTLY PUT THIS LEGISLATION SAYS THAT IF DEVELOPMENTS CAN'T MEET THE STANDARDS. THE LOCALS CANNOT APPROVE THEM. NOW THE STANDARD ARE KEY SAID THE STANDARDS GET INCREASE IN STRONG. AS DEVELOPMENTS GET LARGER THE REASON IS THIS. LARGER DEVELOPMENTS PUT MORE PEOPLE IN THE MOVIE WHILE THE URBAN INTERFACE. ASSEMBLY MUST MEET HIGHER STANDARDS IN SMALLER DEVELOPMENTS. THIS MEANS THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE STRINGENT. BUT ARE NOT TOO COSTLY AS THE TOTALLY PREVENT DEVELOPMENT. EITHER COMMONSENSE AND BY THE WAY WE SHOULD PROBABLY BEEN DONG THIS DECADES AGO LET'S JUST BE BLUNT. AND WE KNOW THAT HALF OF THE BUILDINGS LOST HALF OF THE BUILDINGS LOST IN THE LAST DECADE WERE BUILT IN THE WILL WE- BILL UNDER CURRENT CODE. THAT SUPPOSED TO WITHSTAND. THESE FIRES THIS WILL ALSO ENHANCES THE PLANNING BUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST DO INCLUDING TO COME UP WITH A% STRATEGY TO RETROFIT EXISTING BUILDINGS. YEAH YOU MAY HEAR FROM OPPONENTS TODAY BUT THIS BILL WOULD MAYBE LOOK LABELED AS A HOUSING KILLER. WILL HEAR THE FACTS OF THIS THIS BILL IS ALMOST IDENTICAL ALMOST IDENTICAL TO A BILL THAT WAS APPROVED BY BIPARTISAN MAJORITIES IN BOTH HOUSES AND SENT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK LAST YEAR. WE MADE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR'S CONCERNS. EVERYONE OF THE PROPONENTS ON THIS BILL THIS YEAR. EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE NEUTRAL ON THE LEGISLATION LAST YEAR. AND THEIR CONCERNS THIS YEAR OUR WITH PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL BETTER THE SAME PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE BILL LAST YEAR. I WANT TO REPEAT THAT. THE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL THIS YEAR ARE THE SAME ONES THAT WERE IN LAST YEAR'S BILL WITH SENATOR JACKSON. PLEASE GO BACK INTO THIRTY. OPPONENTS WILL SAY THAT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH OPR HAS CHANGED ITS GUIDANCE SO THAT LARGE DEVELOPMENTS UNDER SB TWELVE WILL NOW HAVE TO PROVE THAT IT'S IN FEASIBLE TO BE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE WILL BE. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY SAYS SB TWELVE SAYS THAT THE WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS MUST AND I QUOTE BE REASONABLE. FEASIBLE AND ACHIEVABLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE DEVELOPMENTS IN EACH CATEGORY. THIS ISN'T SOME QUESTION OF INTERPRETATION IT'S IN BLACK AND WHITE IN THE BILL THE STANDARDS HAVE TO BE FEASIBLE. IN THE STATE FARM ARE FOR MUST GO THROUGH THE FULL FORMAL RULEMAKING PROCESS TO DEVELOP STANDARDS. IN HERE'S WHY WHAT THE OPPOSITION WANTS ISN'T WORKABLE THE VERY PREMISE OF S. B. TWELVE IS THAT LARGER DEVELOPMENTS THAT PUT MORE PEOPLE IN THE WILL YOU. MUST MEET HIGHER STANDARDS IN SMALLER DEVELOPMENTS. OPPOSITION AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THAT HIGHER THRESHOLD NONE THE LESS AND YOU HAVE MY WORD. WE'RE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH ON THIS BILL. TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO HAVE THE FIRE MARSHAL CONSIDER THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN OPR DEVICE THREE. AS LONG AS IS BALANCED BY OTHER STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT LARGE DEVELOPMENTS AREN'T GETTING A PASSED IN CONTINUE TO PUT. FOLKS IN HARM'S WAY THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR OF THIS BILL THAT THE LEGISLATURE- AND S. B. TWELVE. AS THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR THAT THIS BILL IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN SB TWELVE IS THE ONLY BILL THAT BALANCES THE NEED FOR YOU HOUSING. EVEN IN THE WILL YOU WITH FIRE SAFETY. LET'S JUST BE CANDID NOT SINGLE SAY WE CAN'T AFFORD. ANOTHER YEAR WE JUST CAN'T. THESE ARE REASONABLE THEY'RE PRACTICAL AND IT WILL LITERALLY SAVE LIVES THAT IS SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. MISTER VICE CHAIR I'M GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE LAUREN ON THE LINE FOR AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THREE TO PROVIDE OUR LEAD. WITNESS TESTIMONY TODAY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. RICHARD THIS IMPORTANT. NOW DO WE HAVE TO THE- CAN YOU ASK THE FOR PEOPLE IN SUPPORT WHO WISH TO COMMUNICATE- THE END SUPPORT COMMITTEE WILL AT FIRST OF ALL CHECK HERE I DON'T SEE ANYONE IN THIS ROOM AND A TWENTY FORTY ANY BODY THERE WANTING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. TWENTY FORTY SEEING NINE I BELIEVE THERE WAS CERTAINLY WILL BE SOME CALLING IN A MODERATOR CAN YOU ASK THE FOLKS TO QUEUE UP TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL S. B. TWELVE- YES. IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF- S. B. TWELVE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. MISTER CHAIR MISTER BY HERE IS THAT OKAY THAT THE WARREN COURT EIGHTY EIGHT OKAY TO TESTIFY. WE HAVE TO LEAD SUPPORT AND I FORGOT TO LET US GET TO LEAD SUPPORT LAUREN AND DIFFERENTIATE YOU SAVAGES. LAUREN DIFFERENTIATE SATCHER'S. YES DURING SENSORS ARE PLEASE. BRAIN WELL AFTERNOON MR PROVIDE YOUR AND MEMBERS HELLO A YEAH TODAY ARE THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE IN PART ABOUT THE TWELVE WHICH WOULD MAKE A NUMBER OF VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES REGARDING PLANNING FOR INCRIMINATING DEVELOPMENT IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS- WE REALLY APPRECIATE SENATOR MCGUIRE'S EFFORTS ON THE TRACKING ISSUE- OF COURSE THE SENATOR MCGUIRE RT THE ELOQUENTLY HIGHLIGHTED- UNFORTUNATELY WE CONTINUE TO FACE RECORD BREAKING DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY FIRES YEAR AFTER YEAR THAT. ARE NOW ARE ST NEW NORMAL. WE DO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE CAN ANY TO DO MORE TO BETTER FOR. AND SO DOES THIS MEAN IT MEANS RECASTING HOW LAND USE PLANNING HAS BEEN DONE OVER THE YEARS AND FIRED HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. AND ENSURING THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE SUPPORTED WITH GUIDANCE. AND FUNDING TO MAKE THESE CRITICAL CHANGES AND WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A VERY TOUGH ISSUE TO TACKLE AND UNDERSTANDING OF ALL THE CONVERSATION LAST YEAR WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SEE. SB ONE EIGHTY TO PASS- WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT LAST YEAR AND WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT THE BILL BACK AGAIN TO BE CONSIDERED. WE KNOW THAT ANOTHER FIRE SEASON WILL BE UPON US AND SO CHINA VERY CRITICAL. EIGHTY EIGHT THE COURTS THAT ARE REASONABLE AND FEASIBLE WILDFIRE REDUCTION STANDARDS AND PLANNING REQUIREMENTS THE BILL TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING HOME FOR HARDENED AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDERED. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL SURELY SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING PRIORITIES BYENCOURAGING MORE SUSTAINABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES APPROPRIATELY DESIGNING COMMUNITIES AND HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. AND WHEN POSSIBLE DIRECTING DENSITY COLLECT HAZARDOUS AREAS WITHIN A JURISDICTION ALL OF THIS WHILE STILL MAINTAINING THE STATE'S HOUSING PRODUCTION TARGETS FOR EACH REGION TO ENSURE THAT THE NEED TO DEVELOP STAY CLEAN- DOES NOT KEEP HOUSING FROM BEING DEVELOPED IN COMMUNITIES ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. FINALLY APA BELIEVES THAT THE PLANNING REQUIREMENTS COUPLED WITH EFFECTIVE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT STANDARDS AND ADEQUATE FUNDING ARE ALL IMPORTANT PIECES OF THE- PUZZLE THAT THE BILLS SEEK TO PUT TOGETHER. PLANNING MUST BE DONE NOW TO PROTECT HOMES AND LIVES BY PROVIDING FOR MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES AND AGAIN WE REALLY APPRECIATE SENATOR MCGUIRE'S AFRICANIST ISSUE AND A VIRGIN. I ABOUT THANK YOU.

THIS THANK YOU- MISTER- BASED HERE ON ALL THE SUPPORTING MOVING TO CELTIC COMMITTEE BUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY- UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WILL BE COMING TO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. MAX AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CENTER MCGUIRE. ON A- I FIVE SIX OF THE A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL- THE CHAIR AND I HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS TOGETHER. TO TRY TO ACCOMPLISH TWO THINGS IN CALIFORNIA AROUND HOUSING. ONE TO INCREASE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING STRONG PARTNERS IN THAT UPPER. AND TO TRY TO MOVE A REDUCE PRESSURE. AND OUR HIGHEST RISK WILD FIRE AREAS AND FOCUS MORE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE AREAS SPECIFICALLY AND FILL. BY HOUSING AND THAT IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A LONG AND HARD. JOURNEY I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR THE COLLABORATION I KNOW THE CORPORATION IS GOING TO CONTINUE. THIS BILL IN ITS PREVIOUS FORM ALSO WAS A LONG. JOURNEY MAY RECALL- WE PASS IT OUT OF BOTH THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND- GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE- UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO CALL IT BACK INTO COMMITTEE ON CONCURRENCE BECAUSE- THERE WERE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN THAT WERE AND IT WAS A WHOLE. MESSY SITUATION THAT'S WHY I BECAME A TO YOUR BILL- WE ALTERNATELY THAT THE CHAIR AND I WORKED INTENSIVELY WITH. OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE AND WERE ABLE TO. GET SOMETHING TOGETHER YEAH WE GOT TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR VETOED- THE BILL- AND SO I'M GLAD THAT THE BILL IS BACK I THINK OVERWHELMINGLY- IT'S A GOOD BILL- THAT I'M SUPPORTIVE OF. TOM I DO WANT TO AND I DON'T WANT TO SORT OF BE PICTURE. BECAUSE THERE'S A OTHER BILL. BERMAN FIFTY EMPLOYEE US. AT I THINK EVERY HOUSING BILL I'VE ALL. HAS HAD AN- AND EFFORT HIGH RISK WILD FIRE AREAS. TAMAYO AND BILLS IT'S GOING TO ON THE- AND LESSEN THE ONE FIRE. AREAS BECAUSE WE TO VIEW THIS CON. AND SO THERE IS A NO PROTECT BILL THAT FOCUSES ONLY ON ENDING NEW HOUSING IN HIGH RISK WILD FIRE AREAS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING. TO PROMOTE. HOUSING AND NON WILD FIRE AREAS AND WE AND WE NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR. IT IS NOT RANDOM THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH HOUSING BEING BUILT. IN OUR HIGH RISK WILD FIRE AREAS. IT'S BECAUSE WE MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD MUCH HOUSING. IN OTHER AREAS LIKE IN THE BULK OF THE BAY AREA OR PARTS OF L. LIKE WE HAVE THROUGH ZONING AND OTHERWISE WE MADE IT SO DIFFICULT. TO BUILD INFILL HOUSING ROOM POWERED NIMBYS TO SHUT DOWN THE LAY EMPTY HOUSING AND SO IT SPRAWLS OUT. ABOUT TWICE SO MUCH GETS BUILT. IN THE WE SO WE HAVE TO DO. WE HAVE TO DO BOTH. TIMES I DO WANT TO SPECIFICALLY THE V. THE OPR PRINT WAS THE PREVIOUS VERSION THAT I SUPPORTED THAT WE ALL SUPPORTED IRAQ MOST OF US SUPPORTED. I BELIEVE BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WERE SORT OF GIVING A PROXY OPR BY REFERENCING AND THEY'RE AN OPR. HAS ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE SINCE THE VETO OF SB ONE EIGHTY TWO. THAT IS AYE UNDERSTAND THAT- GOES BEYOND- VERY HIGH WILDFIRE RISK AREAS THAT INCLUDE HIGH RISK WHICH IS A HUGE SWATH OF CALIFORNIA- AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT. ON SWEEPING IN SUCH A HUGE AREA WERE THE SKIRT DISCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT AND GIVING TOOLS TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY HOUSING ANYWHERE SO I'M CONFIDENT WE'RE GOING TO RESOLVE THIS- AND I KNOW THAT MY COMMITTEE- WILL AND WE'RE WORKING COSELY WITH- WITH WITH THE AUTHOR OF A CHAIR. ON THIS AND I'M CONFIDENT WE'LL GET IT DONE AND THEN MOVE OUT STRONG BILL WITHOUT SAID I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER AT THE SENATOR ALSO DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO POLLUTION YES- THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR I ALSO- PLAN TO SUPPORT AND- THE REASON I FEEL COMPELLED TO JUST SAY SOMETHING IS IT BECOMES PRETTY OBVIOUS I MEAN NOT. NOT MANY OF US ARE HAVE THE SAME HISTORY OF UNDERSTANDING THE DETAILS OF. OF ON OF HOUSING BILLS BUT IT JUST HITS CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE WHY ARE WE BUILDING IN THESE HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS WE SEE THE LIVES THAT ARE LOST OR HURT WE SEE- DAMAGE TO PROPERTY WE SEE HOW IT IMPACTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND I JUST- I JUST THINK I HAVE I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THAT I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU ALL ARE DOING. ON THE AUTHORS DOING- TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF THIS- AND- THAT'S IT. THANK HELLO LET ME TYPE IN YOUR BROUGH- HAVING REPRESENTED DIFFERENT COUNTIES OVER THE DECADES SHOWN MUCH DETACHED THAT- AND I'VE HAD SOME URBAN AS WELL AS MOST NEW GIRL TO. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY FIRES THE- THE AREAS THAT I REPRESENT OF HAD TO SUFFER. AND WE ARE WELCOMING. WE IN THE MORE RURAL AREAS. THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE HALF DOLLAR ABILITY THAT WE HAVE AND THE SUPPORT THAT'S BEEN FORTHCOMING FROM SUBURBAN AND MORE URBAN AREAS FOR CLEANING UP THE FORCED IN THE WILDLANDS FROM THESE CATACLYSMIC FIRES DO NOT GET IGNITED AND KEEP BURNING- OKAY. YOU SEE THESE. THREE SEVEN AND I THINK PARTICULARLY IF PARADISE HOLDEN CITY HOTEL CALLED AROUND AND GONE HI MATT EIGHTY SIX PEOPLE. NOW THAT'S PRETTY DRAMATIC AND BEING RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT DURING THE BURNING. AND WATCHING THE CARS JAMMED UP WITH THE WATER OF THE PROVISIONS AT THE THIS BILL DOES CONTAIN IS A SECOND EGRESS INGRESS AND EGRESS ROUTES. THAT WAS ONE OF THE IMPAIRMENTS WE COULDN'T GET ANYTHING DONE ABOUT IT FOR DECADES BUT NOW THINGS ARE MOVING IN A BETTER STEP. THE OPPOSITION HAS DIMINISHED TO. MANAGING OUR FORCE THE NORMAL WILDLANDS. THAT'S MOST HELPFUL. IN ALL REMIND FOLKS THAT THERE'S AN IMPACT ON WILDLIFE YES I TOOK A- BUS TOUR OF POKES ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO UP TO PARADISE. LOOKING UP ON A LARGE BORE. DISTASTE. HE WAS BARBECUED BUT NOT ON A SPIT. BUT THAT TO RIP TO RIFIC FIRE. THEN YOU CAN JUST ENVISIONED THEN THE THOUSANDS. BUT WILDLIFE. THERE ARE GONE- HABITAT DESTROYED AND THEN IN THE AFTERMATH ZEROCHAN. THE POLLTES THE WATERS AND COMPLICATED FURTHER. I KNOW THE HATCHER VERY VERY WELL PERSONALLY AND HE'S THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY PERSON OF KNOWN. AND AS A LEGISLATORS ONE WHO WORKS WITH HE'S VERY EASY TO WORK WITH SOME OF THE OPPONENTS FROM OF WHICH YOU'RE CONCERNED I PROBABLY SHARE. BUT I'LL TELL YOU THAT THE CHURCH IS EASY HAD AN AMENABLE TO MAKING AMENDMENTS IN MAKING CHANGES AS HE HAD DEMONSTRATED. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BILL MOVE ALONG. AND THAT KIND OF NEGOTIATION CONTINUE. AND I INTEND TO BE A FORCE WORKING WITH ARCHER GIORGETTI. PICTURE MODE YOU LIKE TO GIVE US OPPOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SURVEYS CHERRY AND- THE- THE VICE CHAIR AND I. UNFORTUNATELY HAVE GONE BACK ON AND- THE REALLY DIFFICULT. FIRES IN BEEN ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AND I ST FORTUNATELY- WE- HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GROW CLOSE WHICH I WILL FOR EVER VALUE- AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN SO HARD HIT. WE HAVE THAT IN COMMON. THE PUTTING ALL POLITICAL DIFFERENCES ASIDE. THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BE ATTACHED AT THE HIP AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON SO MANY ISSUES THAT IS ONCE A THANK YOU AND WHAT THAT HAS MEANT FOR ME. IN GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP OFFICER- INFAMOUS WIENER CENTER WIENER NINE OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS I HAVE GONE THROUGH- INCREDIBLE ISSUES AND CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO WORK IT OUT AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SEND WINNER BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY AND WE ALL COME FROM DIFFERENT SPOTS AND FACES IN LIFE- AND I JUST I VALUE ABOVE THE RELATIONSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP THAT I HAVE. WITH CHAIR OF HOUSING ALONG WITH THE VICE CHAIR OF GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. AND I JUST WANNA JUST ON SOME. WERE LIVING IN A BUBBLE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. EVERYTHING TODAY'S INCOMING WHERE WE'RE GOING TO START. LOOKING AT NOT BUILDING IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS WITH THEM IN A BUBBLE. EDITORIAL BOARDS ARE ALREADY OPINIE ACROSS THE STATE THAT WE NEED TO START TEARS A CONSIDERING. AT THIS BILL WOULD HAVE GOTTEN REALLY CLOSE LAST YEAR TO BE ABLE TO BAN- THROUGH POLICY. NEW HOUSING IN HIGH FIRE RISK ZONES. I UNDERSTAND THE MINISTRATION DID NOT WANT TO MESS UP THE NEXT RINA CYCLE- AND THAT IS A CONCERN BY THE WAY THAT THE CHAIR OF HOUSING% BROUGHT FORWARD AS WELL I WANT TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOU THAT. IN THIS BILL ZITO. THAT LANGUAGE IS NOW OUT. SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO CHANGE WITH THE TIMES THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. REGARDLESS OF THE BUILDING CODE THAT WE HAVE NOW. LET'S GO BACK TO THE FACTS. HALF OF THE HOMES THAT WE'VE LOST IN THE LAST DECADE DELYLAH FIRE IN THE WORLD. FIVE THE REALITY IS THAT STATE LAW OR ORDER REQUIRES. CITY GOVERNMENTS TO CONSIDER THE OPI OPR TECHNICAL ADVISORY- ITEMS WHEN THEY UPDATE THEIR JOURNAL PLANS FOR FIRE HAZARDS. IN ITS NOT NEW BY THE WAY. THE OTHER ISSUE IS THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT BANNING DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORLD IT'S NOT IT CREATES A PATH TO DEVELOP FAITHFULLY IN EVERY JURISDICTION IN THE STANDARDS ARE CRITICAL FOR THAT- THE OTHER PIECE I THINK IT'S WORTH REPEATING THESE- PIERCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TECHNICAL ADVISORY WHICH WAS THE ADVISORY IN PLACE LAST YEAR. SAID THIS I WANT TO QUOTE. THE FOLLOWING NUMBER ARE EXAMPLES OF POLICIES AT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT MY DOC TO MITIGATE DAMAGE TO VALUES AND ASSETS RELATED WILDFIRE AVOID WERE FEASIBLE APPROVING NEW DEVELOPMENT IN AREAS SUBJECT TO OFFER RISK IF OF WOULDN'T IT IS NOT FEASIBLE CONDITION SUCH AS NEW DEVELOPMENT ON OR IMPLEMENTATION. OF MEASURES TO REDUCE RISKS WITH THAT DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED YEAH. WE CAN DEBATE THE NEW LANGUAGE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS BILL SAYS THE STANDARDS MUST BE FEASIBLE AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY THIS IS ALL ABOUT. THERE'S NO WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET AROUND THAT. AND AGAIN THIS BILL IS STRICTLY LIMITED IT'S STRICTLY LIMITED TO VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES IT DOES NOT TOUCH FIVE FIRE HAZARDS ON SITE IS GOING TO MAKE SURE. THAT ALL OF YOU ARE. CLEAR ON THAT BECAUSE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. THAT IS CLEAR THE LAST THING ON PHASES. IT'S AT THE MINIMUM FOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE WEEKS. AND AS WE NOW ENGAGE. HALF OF THE BUILDINGS AFTER LAST DECADE WERE IN THE WEEDS ALL OF THOSE WERE BUILT UNDER CURRENT FIRE CODE. THIS BILL IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO A BILL THAT WAS APPROVED WITH BIPARTISAN MAJORITIES IN BOTH HOUSES SENT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK LAST YEAR. IN EVERY ONE OF THE PROPONENTS. EVERYONE OF THE OPPONENTS ON THIS BILL WERE NEUTRAL ON THE LEGISLATION LAST YEAR. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING IN YOUR MY COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THOSE. WHO MAY BE OPPOSED TO THIS- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE A COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATIONS AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN AFFORDABLE COMPETITIVE HOUSING. HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS. AND THIS IS S. B. TWELVE CENTER MCGUIRE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSING SENATOR MCGUIRE ASKED REQUIRE HI SENATOR NIELSEN HI ILSAN HI SENATOR DORADO DORADO HI SENATOR HERTZBERG. SENATOR WIENER WIENER HI. FOUR ZERO. FOR NOW PLACE THE CALL IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. SENATE MCGUIRE YOU NOW ALSO HAVE S. B. ONE OH FOUR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SECURE ALL RIGHT UNLESS YOU EVER THINK WE MAY HAVE A BILL THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE UPON FIRST AND FOREMOST- THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE. THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE KEPT WHOLE AND- IT IS FOCUSED ON ALL ISSUES OF TAXES- IN PERSON FOR pSUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT IS DETAILED IN THE ANALYSIS SOME BACK STORY TO THIS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CONGRESS AND THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED A BILL THAT TRULY PUNISH CALIFORNIA'S. INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES ON THE SO CALLED TAX REFORM BILL CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE PREVIOUSLY PROVED PROP SIXTY THREE THE MILLIONAIRES TAX TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL AS PROP THIRTY IN FIFTY FIVE IN A FIVE HIGHER INCOME TAX RATES TO DOES A GREATER MEANS TO FIND EDUCATION CRIMINAL JUSTICE REALIGNMENT. ALL FOR THAT BUT CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP DECIDED TO LIMIT THE DEDUCTION OF STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES NOT NOW KNOWN AS THE SOLE CAP IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE FEDERAL TAX SYSTEM IT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO AND IT PREVENTED BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE TAXES. FROM BOTH THE FEDERAL ID THAT PREVENTED BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE TAXES FROM TAXING THE SAME INCOME. AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE. MANY CAL PAY HIGH FEDERAL TO. INCLUDING SOME BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF KOBE NINETEEN SB ONE OH FOUR SIMPLY REVERSES THE STATE AND LOCAL TAXES LIMITS. ADVANCED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BY HELPING THE SMALL BUSINESSES DR STATE AND LOCAL TAXES ABOVE THE SOFT CAP HERE'S WHAT IT DOES NUMBER ONE. IT CREATES AN ELECTIVE TAX A PASS THROUGH. THE ATVS CAN CHOOSE TO PAY BUT ONLY IF THEY WANT TO SECOND PROVIDES OWNERS% OF THOSE PASS THROUGH ENTITIES. OKAY THE OPTIONAL TAX A TAX CREDIT TO PREVENT DOUBLE TAXATION. NOW I KNOW THIS IS CONFUSING FOR THE ME JUST SAY THIS. WE KNOW THAT THIS APPROACH WORKS BECAUSE THE IRS HAS ISSUED A NOTICE LAST YEAR ALLOWING THE SAME DEDUCTIONS IT THAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. IN OKLAHOMA. CONNECTICUT LOUISIANA THE NEW JERSEY IN RED AND BLUE STATES. THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL IS NEARLY REVENUE NEUTRAL OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THE BILL. ALSO CONTAINS A SUNSET CLAUSE. AFFECTED CHEN FIRST TWENTY. THE SAME YEAR THAT THE- SALT CAP. THE SAME TAX YEAR AS A CELL CAP IN FEDERAL LAW. BY THE GOVERNOR NOW IS INCLUDED A SIMILAR PROPOSAL AS PART OF HIS PROPOSED BUDGET. NOW SB ONE OF FOUR DIFFERS FROM HIS PROPOSAL IN TWO WAYS NUMBER ONE. THIS BILLS AS A MORE STRATEGIC RATE FOR THE ENTITY LEVEL TAX AT NINE POINT 3% WHICH PROVIDES A BIGGER INCENTIVE FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN LOWER INCOME TAX RATES BRACKETS. DIPPERS PARTICIPATE COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED THIRTEEN POINT 3% RATE. SECOND IN THE REASON WHY WE DID THAT IS TRYING TO KEEP THIS IS REVENUE NEUTRAL AS POSSIBLE JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT IT. SECONDLY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSAL APPLIES TO S. CORPORATIONS BECAUSE ONLY INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS CAN BE OWNERS OF RECORD S. COVERAGE EZCORP CALVARY CORPORATIONS. SO TRACKING THE PAYMENT ELECTED TAX AND THE CLEANING OF THE CREDIT CAN BE TRACKED BY TAXPAYERS AN FTP. THIS BILL THOUGH. APPLIES MORE KINDS ENTITIES SUCH AS PARTNERSHIPS AND LLCS BUT KEEPS A LIMIT ON ENTITIES WHOLLY OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS AND ALSO ALLOWS FAMILY BUSINESSES. ARE OWNED BY STATE ESTATES INSURANCE TO QUALIFY AS WELL. SO AGAIN THIS IS A WIN WIN. FOR CALIFORNIANS AND WE HAVE WITH US TODAY PRESTIN YANG WITH THE CONFERENCE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN KEVIN PROPRIETY WITH THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES AND THE NATIONAL. EZCORP ASSOCIATION. I TO BE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. SB TWELVE DO YOU HAVE SOME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THE CHAIRMAN NOTED- THE- TWENTY SEVENTEEN TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT IMPOSED A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF CALORIES I'M STATE LOCAL TAXES CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS CAN DEDUCT ON THEIR FEDERAL RETURNS IN ADDITION TO INDIVIDUALS CAP ALSO APPLIES TO INCOME EARNED BY CALIFORNIA PASS THROUGH BUSINESSES ORGANIZED AS S. CORPORATIONS PARTNERSHIPS AND LLCS. AS A RESULT CALIFORNIA'S ONE MILLION- PARTNERSHIPS AND S. CORPORATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO TAX RATES TWO POINT EIGHT THREE POINT FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER THAN IF THEY WERE ALLOWED TO FULLY DEDUCT THESE TAXES. THE HIGHER TAXES BUT MANY CALIFORNIA MAIN STREET BUSINESSES AT A DISADVANTAGE TO PASS THROUGH BUSINESSES OPERATING IN STATES WITH NO INCOME TAX FOR THOSE OPERATING IN STATES THAT HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED ASSAULT REFORM. TO ADDRESS THIS SB ONE OF FOUR WOULD RESTORE THE FULL SALT DEDUCTION TO CALIFORNIA AFTER BUSINESSES SB ONE OF FOUR IS REVENUE NEUTRAL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S RESTORE DEDUCTION REDUCES FEDERAL NOT STATE TAXES OWNED AS A CHAIR POINTED OUT NINE STATES OF ALL PASSED SIMILAR STE- STOP REFORMS WON'T TEN OTHER STATES ARE ACTIVELY CONSIDERING THAT- THIS YEAR. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THE IRS ANNOUNCED OF THE STATE AND LOCAL TAXES IMPOSED AT THE ENTRY LEVEL ON PASS THROUGH ENTITIES ARE PERMITTED AS A DEDUCTION AND THAT THIS TREATMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH A LONGSTANDING. POSITION OF THE AGENCY. SB OH FOUR IS A WIN FOR. AND ITS BUSINESS OWNERS. IT REDUCES. FOR OUR THROUGH BUSINESS DURING VERY DIFFICULT TIMES ALL AT NO COST TO THE STATE. FOR THESE REASONS.
