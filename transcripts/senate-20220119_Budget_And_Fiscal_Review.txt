WHICH IN ADDITION TO FULL COMMITTEEHEARINGS ON THE PROJECT- AND OF COURSE MORE IN DEPTH DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE PROPOSAL SKIN THAT JANUARY TEN BUDGET WILL TAKE PLACE IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEES. SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS WILL BEGIN EARLIER THAN NORMAL WE EXPECT TO HAVE HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY AND INTO THE FIRST WEEK OF MARCH- THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR REFLECTS A CONTINUATION OF STRONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY FOR OUR STATE AND VERY STRONG REVENUES- WE I THINK ALL OF US WHO ARE PART OF THIS PROCESS KNOW. THAT SINCE THE RECESSION THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN AN NUMBER OF MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S FISCAL RESILIENCY. AND AS A RESULT. WE HAVE WE ARE IN THIS SITUATION WITH VERY HEALTHY REVENUES. HOWEVER THE FISCAL RECOVERY THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS SPENT ON EQUAL THERE IS A RECENT OXFAM REPORT THAT HIGHLIGHTS THIS. THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD'S TEN RICHEST MEN. DOUBLED FROM SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION TWO ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION JUST IN THE TWO YEARS OF THIS PANDEMIC. WELL THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION NOT ONLY IN OUR STATE BUT ELSEWHERE. HAVE LOST INCOME DURING COVERT NINETEEN. SO THE FOCUS OF OUR BUDGET SHOULD NOT ONLY BE ON PROVIDING THE MUCH NEEDED ASSISTANCE TO SUSTAIN ALL OF US TO THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO ON BUILDING A FUTURE THAT IS MORE EQUITABLE FOR CALIFORNIA. OUR SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS RELEASED HE VALUES IN DECEMBER. AND OUR OUR HEADLINE FOR THAT WAS TO PUT CALIFORNIA'S WEALTH TO WORK FOR A MORE EQUITABLE ECONOMY. AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS OUTLINED IN JANUARY TENTH COMPLIMENT MANY OF THE SENATE'S PRIORITIES AND RECOMMEND THE DEPLOYMENT OF RESOURCES WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THE FUTURE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. NOW WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF THIS COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND IT CONTINUES TO IMPACT ALL FACETS OF OUR LIVES INCLUDING OUR SCHOOLS OUR BUSINESSES AND SO MUCH MORE. IN ADDITION WE FACE THAT WE CALIFORNIA FACE NUMEROUS OTHER CHALLENGES INCLUDING HOMELESSNESS. OR LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR SHORTAGE OF HOUSING IN GENERAL HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD. OUR HOUSING THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE URGENT CLIMATE CRISIS ISSUES.

WHETHER DUE TO THE ISOLATION OR OTHER REASONS AND THE NEED TO RESPOND WITH ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES LIKE THIS WHERE WE HAVE SOME- HIGHER THAN PROJECTED REVENUES AND ALSO FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN LOOK TO. OUR EDUCATION FACILITIES AND OTHERS THAT MAY NEED SUPPORT TO STRENGTHEN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OF COURSE WE ARE ALSO LOOKING IN THIS AT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE WORK FOR SHORTAGES IN THE STATE SOME OF THEM. FOR A FOR REASONS FOR PEOPLE NOT WILLING YET TO GO BACK TO WORK OR NOT ABLE TO BECAUSE OF LACK OF CHILD CARE OR OTHER SERVICES AND SOME OF THEM BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A SHORTAGE FOR YEARS WHETHER IT'S A NURSING TEACHING MENTAL HEALTH OR OTHER SOME OTHER. WORKFORCE CATEGORIES WHICH WE SHOULD LOOK AT HOW TO STRENGTHEN SO THE WORK WE ARE DOING IS ESSENTIAL AS IT HAS EVER BEEN I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER AS A COMMITTEE TO COMPLETE THE SENATE'S WORK IN CRAFTING THE STATE'S BUDGET.

LOSING THE REMAINING GAP AND COVERING INCOME ELIGIBLE ADULTS AGE TWENTY NINE. TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY NINE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS.

BY RETAIL THEFT- INCLUSION THIS IS A BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT AND EXCITING PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ACT SAID THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS ALWAYS SERVED AS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR DISCUSSION AND DEBATE WITH LEGISLATURE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE SPRING STARTING WITH THOSE ISSUES WHICH WE ASK FOR EARLY ACTION UPCOMING NINETEEN DIRECT COSTS AND PAID SICK LEAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I AM JOINED BY SEVERAL COLLEAGUES AND WHEN THE TIME IS HERE WE'RE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO MEMBER QUESTIONS- AFTER THE LA- PRESENTATION THANK YOU. I THANK YOU SECRETARIAL DEPARTMENT'S DEPUTY SECRETARY LEE- APOLOGIES THAT WE HAD TO HAVE THAT INTERRUPTION BUT REALLY APPRECIATE THE OVERVIEW YOU'VE PROVIDED I'M SURE THERE WILL BE MEMBER QUESTIONS BUT LET ME TURN NOW TO OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST MR PADDOCK. GO AHEAD. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND- MR BACK CHAIR AND MEMBERS WERE INVITING US TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AT THIS HEARING. MY NAME IS DAVE HEADACHES- LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND- I TODAY TO HAND OUT THAT I AM QUICKLY SHARING ON THE SCREEN- AND THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS ALSO AVAILABLE ALONG WITH OUR YOUTH AND- REVIEW GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PORT. ON OUR WEBSITE AT ILIO DOT CA DOT GOV. FOR ANYBODY FOLLOWING FROM THE OUTSIDE- AND THEN- IT AFTER I GIVE MY REMARKS MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE OFFICE WILL BE HAPPY ALSO TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS- THAT NUMBERS MAY HAVE- BUT- BEFORE. I GO INTO THE HAND OUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A NOTE THAT- YOU'LL HEAR ME DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR'S ESTIMATED SURPLUS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED RESPONSE TO THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS WENT AHEAD- THE- COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAJOR PROPOSALS AND THEN SOME- CLOSING REMARKS ON. OUR VIEW OF THE STATE'S BUDGET CONDITION AND RESERVES AND SO THROUGHOUT THESE COMMENTS I THINK THAT YOU'LL BE F. TEAM MEMBERS- IN WHICH WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND. HOW TO PRESERVE LEGISLATIVE FLEXIBILITY. AND TO ALSO KEEP IN MIND WAYS TO- YOU KNOW ON THE MARGIN CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S FISCAL RESILIENCE. ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE ONGOING UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC. RISING INFLATION. AND ANY NUMBER OF OTHER CHALLENGES THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND I JUST WOULD YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RESERVED AND RESILIENCE I I'D LIKE TO JUST UNDERSCORED THAT WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT JUST FOR THEIR OWN SAKE- OR EVEN SOME ABSTRACT NOTION OF FISCAL PRUDENCE. IT'S REALLY SO THAT THE STATE CAN BE IN A STRONG POSITION TO UPHOLD THE COMMITMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PREVIOUSLY MADE. AND SO THAT THE STATE CAN SUSTAIN VITAL PROGRAMS. FOR IT FOR OUR RESIDENTS IN THE EVENT OF ANOTHER UNEXPECTED. SHOCK OR A DOWNTURN. SO WITH THAT- I WILL- GO AHEAD AND GO INTO THE- TO THE HAND OUT HERE BEGINNING ON PAGE ONE- HERE WE HAVE TO FIGURE IS THE FIRST ONE ON THE TOP DISPLAYED THE WAY THAT. THE GOVERNOR- ALLOCATE THE DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS ON THE NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE BUDGET AS YOU KNOW WE RUN OUR OWN INDEPENDENT CALCULATIONS OF HAT THE SURPLUS IS AND IN THIS YEAR'S EXERCISE WE CAME TO A CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS A SURPLUS OF ABOUT. TWENTY NINE BILLION WHICH IS A BIT LARGER THAN- WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IDENTIFIED IN THE IN THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOCUMENT OF. TWENTY ONE BILLION. I WOULD KNOW WHAT IT WAS THE TWENTY NINE BILLION IS. FAIRLY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAD ESTIMATED BACK IN OUR NOVEMBER OUTLOOK JUST TO KIND OF KEEP. THE NUMBERS IT- IT FAMILIAR TO YOU- WE HAD ESTIMATED A THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR. DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS NOW WE HAVE TO MEET THE GOVERNOR CAME TO ABOUT TWENTY NINE BILLION ALTHOUGH THEY IDENTIFIED TWENTY ONE BILLION. SO THE- BASICALLY WE HAVE I THINK I BELIEVE OUR OFFICES APPROACH THE ESTIMATION OF THE DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS VERY. SIMILAR WAY USING A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. BUT WHERE WE DIFFER. IN THIS CASE IS THAT- ART YEAH THE ADMINISTRATION TREATS SOME. SPENDING AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BUT ARE NOT CURRENTLY ENACTED IN LIFE. AS PART OF THE STATE SPENDING BASE STILL DISCRETIONARY CHOICES OF THE LEGISLATURE ONE OF THE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MAIN EXAMPLES WOULD BE THE THREE POINT FIVE BILLION- PROPOSED TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH IS VERY REASONABLE IN OUR VIEW I MEAN IT REFLECTS THE- SOME AGREEMENTS THAT WERE MADE LAST YEAR BUT ULTIMATELY THOSE WERE NOT ENACTED INTO- BUDGET LAW. AND SO YOU KNOW WE DID REVIEW THAT IT'S STILL BEING ADDED A MATTER OF DISCRETION FOR THE LEGISLATURE SO IT'S REALLY NOT JUST IN A DIFFERENT HOUSE IN THE COUNTY IT REALLY REFLECTS A CONSCIOUS CHOICE ON OUR PART TO. DEFER TO YOUR AUTHORITY OVER APPROPRIATIONS AND SO. GIVE ME. I AM SO WELL YOU MAY GO IT DECIDED TO ADHERE TO THOSE AGREEMENTS AS THE GOVERNOR HAS REFLECTED IN HIS PROPOSAL- BEFORE THE MONEY CAN BE SPENT IT WOULD STILL REQUIRE YOU MAKING AN APPROPRIATION AND SO WE DON'T. ASSUME THAT UP FRONT- SO WHEN YOU DO THAT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT COMES UP TO TWENTY NINE BILLION IN A SURPLUS. WHERE IS THE ADMINISTRATION HAD TWENTY ONE BILLION. WHEN I TURN TO THAT FIGURE ON PAGE ONE HERE ARE THE TOP ONE IS SHOWING HOW THE GOVERNOR WOULD ALLOCATE THAT SURPLUS. AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS THE LARGEST AMOUNT IN- ONE TIMER TEMPORARY PROGRAMMATIC SPENDING WE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY TO BE THREE YEARS OR LESS. ABOUT SEVENTEEN POINT THREE BILLION. HE HAS. PROPOSED SIX POINT TWO BILLION OR REVENUE REDUCTION. AND THEN- HE'S PROPOSING THREE POINT ONE BILLION TO GO INTO THE STATE'S DISCRETIONARY RESERVE WHICH IS THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. THERE ARE TWO BILLION IN ONGOING SPENDING PROPOSALS WHICH WE ESTIMATE WOULD INCREASE TO ABOUT YOU KNOW TO MORE THAN FIVE BILLION THROUGH THE FORECAST TO RISE IN WHICH IS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. AND THEN THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION IN. DEBT REPAYMENT ON TOP OF THE FOUR BILLION IN DEBT REPAYMENT IS REQUIRED BY PROPOSITION TWO. I WILL ALSO JUST NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES ALMOST TWENTY FIVE BILLION IN WHAT WE CALL GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVES. THAT IS THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. AND THE S. F. B. U. R. SO THOSE ARE THE ONES WE COUNT WHEN WE REFER TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION. THE SECOND FIGURE BUT- HOW TO START THE SECOND FIGURE ON ON THE PAGE IS- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR SPENDING AND IN THE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT N. HERE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF HIGHER REVENUES WHICH RESULT IN A HIGHER MINIMUM GUARANTEE THERE'S ALMOST EIGHTEEN BILLION IN- PROPOSED NEW SPENDING. AND SO EVEN AFTER COVERING A FIVE POINT BILLION DOLLAR COST THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES ALLOCATING ABOUT THIRTEEN BILLION IN RESOURCES THEY SHOWN IN THAT IN THAT FIGURE SEVEN BILLION FOR ONE TIME ACTIVITY THREE POINT FOUR BILLION FOR THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM WHICH WAS INITIATED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. ONE POINT TWO BILLION IN AN ADJUSTMENT FOR DISTRICT- BECAUSE OF THE STATEWIDE DECLINING ENROLLMENT SITUATION BECAUSE THERE IS A JUDGMENT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES THAT- COSTS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION. AND THEN- ONE POINT THREE BILLION AND IN OTHER WORDS SEVERAL ONGOING INCREASES. AND THEN LIKE I REFERRED WITH THE BOOK YEAH DISCRETIONARY GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVES- THERE IS UNDER THE RULES OF PROPOSITION TWO THIRDS NOW- THE PROPOSAL REFLECTS THAT THERE IS NOW GOING TO BE A- PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVE. ALMOST TEN BILLION WHICH IS THE HIGHEST IT'S BEEN- TODAY SO. THAT IS NOTABLE. MOVING TO PAGE TWO I WANTED TO GIVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH TO THE STATE APPROPRIATION PLAN ENTERED AGAIN LIMITED SOMETIMES REFERRED TO YOU. AND IT- YOU KNOW THE DEATH AT A HIGH LEVEL. AFFECTS HOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN USE REVENUES THAT EXCEED A CERTAIN THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS STEMMING FROM. EXCEEDING THE FELL FOR THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS WHEN IT IS A TWO YEAR CALCULATION AND SO FOR THE PRIOR YEAR IN THE CURRENT YEAR SO TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGES THE GOVERNOR REFLECTS THE STATE HAS THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS ARE OVER THAT LIMIT BY A COMBINED TWO POINT SIX BILLION. THE REQUIREMENT. WOULD BE MORE THAN THIS WE WOULD BE OVER THE LIMIT BY MORE THAN THIS EXCEPT THAT THE BUDGET. PROPOSAL INCLUDES ABOUT SIX POINT THREE BILLION AND PROPOSALS THAT- MEETS OUR REQUIREMENTS THUS LOWERING. APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT BY THAT AMOUNT- NO NOTABLY THE GOVERNOR DID NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL FOR DEALING WITH THESE EXCESS REVENUES. AND INDICATES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL COME BACK AND PUT FORWARD A PLAN AT THE MAY REVISION WE HAVE BETTER AND MORE UP TO DATE INFORMATION. THAT'S ONE APPROACH BUT WE ACTUALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO BEGIN THINKING ABOUT DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR MEETING THE FELL REQUIREMENT BEFORE ME. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT DELAYING THE FORMATION OF A PLAN. REALLY REDUCES LEGISLATIVE FLEXIBILITY SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE REVENUES YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN SEEING STRONG REVENUE TRENDS AS THE CHAIR NOTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE OF THE HEARING WE'VE BEEN SEEING VERY STRONG REVENUE TRENDS AND IF THAT CONTINUES AND THEY CONTINUE TO OUTPACE. OUR BUDGET ESTIMATES. AND THE LEGISLATURE PREFERRED TO ADDRESS A PORTION OF IT- SAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PRODUCED BY THAT- THROUGH LOWERING TAX REVENUES THEN EARLY ACTION WOULD BE BETTER THAN WAITING UNTIL MAY MAY NOT EVEN REALLY BE FEASIBLE IF YOU WAIT UNTIL THAT POINT IN THE FISCAL YEAR. FOR THE CURRENT YEAR- FIREMAN'S UNDERSELL SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO BEGIN THINKING ABOUT IT SOONER THAN THAT- AND THEN AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REFLECTED THERE IS STILL ROOM AT ABOUT FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION. AND MEANING THAT THE APPROPRIATION- HE'S PROPOSING IN TOTAL- THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT WOULD BE BELOW THE LIMIT BY THAT AMOUNT BUT ALSO I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS ALSO PROPOSING AROUND TWELVE BILLION IN PROPOSALS THAT REDUCE REVENUES FOR OUR APPROPRIATION CENTERS THAT ARE- EXEMPT FROM THE LIMIT SO IN OTHER WORDS- THOSE ARE IMPORTANT TOO- HAVING THIS ROOM. UNDER THE CELL. REALLY OVERALL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TWENTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS THAT THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HAS ABOUT SIXTEEN BILLION IN PROPOSALS THAT ADDRESS DEL REQUIREMENTS AND THEN ANOTHER THIRTEEN BILLION THAT ARE- PROPOSALS THAT ARE NOT EXCLUDABLE FROM THE CELL THOSE INCLUDE- NINE POINT FOUR BILLION IN SPENDING AND THEN THREE. BILLION IN- ENOUGH THAT THE- DISCRETIONARY RESERVE AN FF B. U. WHICH- HAS HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT. IS ACTUALLY IT'S NOT X. EXEMPT FROM THE CELL THAT COUNTS TOWARDS THAT FELT SO. ONE OF THIS MEANS THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE LEGISLATORS RANGE OF CHOICES ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. BROADLY SPEAKING IN ORDER TO KEEP THE LIMIT. TO KEEP APPROPRIATION BUT BELOW THE LIMIT IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. ANY OF THE SIXTEEN BILLION IN SALIX GOOGLE PROPOSAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO REJECT. REALLY SHOULD THINK ABOUT REPLACING THOSE WITH OTHER APPLICATIONS THAT ARE ALSO SALIX BOOTABLE FOR THEIR SOME LIMITATION ON YOUR FLEXIBILITY THERE. ON THE OTHER HAND ANY OF THE THIRTEEN BILLION THEY'RE ALREADY BEING PROPOSED IS NOT EXCLUDABLE PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR- AT THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE DIRECT REJECT THOSE IN REPLACE THOSE WITH OTHER CHOICES. YOU HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT IT'S REALLY THESE LARGER AMOUNTS YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU CAN'T VARY TOO MUCH FROM THOSE LARGER AMOUNTS AND REMAINS- UNDERNEATH THE CELL- AS IT'S CURRENTLY. WORKS. SO NOW I'LL MOVE ON TO. THE THIRD PAGE ARE WE OFFERED SOME COMMENTS ON ON SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAJOR SPENDING PROPOSAL. AND HERE ARE. YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF OVER ARCHING REMARKS FIRST OF ALL OVERALL WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT. THEN THE GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF LAST YEAR'S COMMITMENT- THAT- MY COLLEAGUE FROM FINANCE THIRTY MENTIONED. IT IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO DEDICATE SOME PORTION OF THE EARLY PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS THIS YEAR TO CHECKING END ESSENTIALLY ON HOW THAT IS GOING HOW IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE CHOICES GOING. OUT WITH THE ROLLOUT OF THE FUNDING WORKING AND SORT OF PERFORM PERFORMING BASICALLY SOME AMOUNT OF AN OVERSIGHT FUNCTION IN THAT PROCESS. RELATED LINKS WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO BE CAUTIOUS THEN ABOUT CREATING NEW OR SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED- EXISTING PROGRAMS- UST BEARING IN MIND THAT STATE OVERALL CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT THESE. NEW INITIATIVES. BANDANNAS THE OVERALL COMMENT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE DO THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR- THE RECOGNITION ESSENTIALLY THAT THE PANDEMIC IS STARTING TO APPEAR LIKE IT COULD BE AN ONGOING OVER A LONGER TERM ISSUE FOR US ALL TO DEAL WITH. AND YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS RECOGNIZE THIS REALITY AND YOU MAY HAVE- SOME IMPORTANT- PREFERENCES TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT- AS YOU AS YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT. THAT- PROSPECT- ON THE NEXT TWO PAGES FOUR AND FIVE I THINK I WILL- JUST. ESSENTIALLY POINT OUT TO YOU WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS. A LIST OF SEVERAL OF THE MAJOR PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND SOME OF OUR INITIAL CONTENT- UNDERNEATH THEM I WILL NOT GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM THEY'RE KIND OF IN KEEPING WITH THE THEMES THAT I JUST MENTIONED. BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL I JUST WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM WHAT I WILL SAY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THIS DID THAT TAKE ONE EXAMPLE INDICATED FOURTEEN. AREA THE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING- MANY NEWPROGRAMS AND REQUIREMENTS. IN THE MIDST OF- THE ONGOING DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC AND THEIR CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT MORE NEW PROGRAMS IS LIKELY LIMITED SO WE KIND OF HAD THAT OVER ALL.CONTENT RECOMMEND FINDING FEWER NEW PROGRAMS AND PRIORITIZING THOSE THAT ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS THAT CANNOT BE ADDRESSED WITH- THE EXISTING PROGRAMS SO IT'S KIND OF THAT TYPE OF THINKING APPLIED. SOMEWHAT ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT AREAS IT WOULD BE MY CONTENT. BY MOVING. IMAGE SIX OF THE HAND OUT HERE JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THE STATE- OVERALL BUDGET CONDITION. YOU MAY RECALL THAT IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE DESCRIBED THE ADMINISTRATION'S REVENUE ESTIMATE AS IS REASONABLE. THOUGH THAT CAUTIOUS AND NOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SHOWS REVENUE ESTIMATES THERE ARE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN BEFORE OVER THE THREE YEAR BUDGET WINDOW THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RAISED ITS REVENUE ESTIMATES BY FORTY ONE BILLION FROM THE BUDGET ACT. MAKING THEM ACTUALLY MUCH CLOSER TO WHAT WE CONSIDER IT IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT OUR REVENUE ESTIMATE. WE'VE KIND OF DONE WE'VE DEVELOPED A RANGE OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE. AND THERE AT THE MINUTE IS NOW PRETTY CLOSE TO OUR MEDIAN RANGE OUR OUR% MEDIAN ESTIMATE WITHIN THAT RANGE SO WE ARE REFERRING TO IT AS THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND ARIEL. AS LIKELY YOU KNOW THIS IS LIKELY TO BE AS- YOU KNOW IT'S JUST AS LIKELY THAT REVENUES WILL COME IN HIGHER IS THAT IS THAT WILL THAT THEY'LL COME IN LOWER ACCORDING TO OUR BEST ESTIMATE. THAT SAME LOGIC. SAME PROCESS APPLIES TO THE ADMINISTRATION MULTIPLE YEAR REVENUE ESTIMATES. AGAIN THEY ARE REASONABLE- AND THEY'RE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN BEFORE BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE YOUR REVENUE ESTIMATE. BUT AS WE NOTED BEFORE- IF YOU ADOPT THE REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT ARE HIGHER- THEN THEY- INHERENTLY ARE GOING TO BE LESS SUBJECT TO UPWARD REVISION IN THE FUTURE. YOU'RE ALREADY CAPTURING SOME OF THAT UPWARD NASH IN THE INITIAL ESTIMATE. IT'S REALLY BECOMES IMPORTANT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE SPENDING PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD BY THE ADMINISTRATION- REALLY EXCEED. ITS OWN ESTIMATE. OF THE STATE'S FUTURE BUDGET CAPACITY THIS IS DEMONSTRATED IN YOU LOOK AT THE ADMINISTRATION MULTIPLE YEAR REVENUE- AND MULTIPLE YEAR- GENERAL FUND FORECAST. IT SHOWS THAT NEGATIVE- SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY BALANCES IN THE IN THE THREE YEARS FOLLOWING THE BUDGET YEAR SO. IT'S ESSENTIALLY ASSUMING THAT AT SOME POINT ALONG THE WAY. REVENUES WILL BE HIGHER THAN WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO BE OR THAT EXPENDITURES WILL BE LOWER SO. THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND- FINALLY ON THE LAST PAGE HERE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT- THE PROPOSAL ON ON- RESERVES. AND THE FIRST THING I'LL JUST NOTE IS THAT WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT OF- METHODOLOGY HERE WE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVES WHICH AS I SAID WHERE THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. THE SFU THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. WE DIFFERENTIATE THAT GROUP FROM THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVE- THE- THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVE IS VERY HELPFUL. FOR MAINTAINING EDUCATION FUNDING IN A DOWN YEAR- IT WOULD IT WOULD PROVIDE A WAY TO- SUSTAIN FUNDING FOR THE SCHOOLS AT A CONSTANT LEVEL. BUT THOSE BALANCES REALLY WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO HELP THE U. AT THE LEGISLATURE OR OUR POLICY MAKERS- IT WOULD NOT REALLY BE AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU CLOSE AN ESTIMATED BUDGET PROBLEMS. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE REASON WE MAKE THAT DISTINCTION. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVE THEY ARE YOU KNOW APPROACHING TWENTY FIVE BILLION WHICH SHIP FROM A NOMINAL STANDPOINT IS VERY I. AGREE I BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AS A SHARE OF THE STATE BUDGET WHICH IS REALLY THE IMPORTANT WAY TO LOOK AT IT. YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY STILL REMAIN A LITTLE BIT BELOW- WHAT THEIR LEVEL WAS HIRED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SO. YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO THINK THAT- CONSIDERING HIGHER DISCRETIONARY RESERVE IS WARRANTED AND- SO WITH THAT I'LL STOP HERE AND- I KNOW THAT ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE OFFICE WOULD BE HAPPY TO. RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MR BERWICK SAYS ALWAYS A VERY GOOD OVERVIEW FROM THE LA- AND ALSO OF COURSE- THANK YOU CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR- ERICA LEAK. FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO LET ME TURN NOW. TO MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS BEFORE WE CHECK FOR EITHER THE LA- OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO LET'S SEE I'VE GOT MISTER CORTESE MISCON LAGER MR PAN. HI MR LAYERED COLLEGES WOULD YOU WERE YOU STANDING UP TO SHOW ME THAT YOU WANTED TO. I COULDN'T- CHILL OF THE STANDING UP WAS JUST TO STAY OUTDOORS SO I WILL GET YOU ON THIS LIST. BUT LET ME FIRST TURNED TO MY VICE CHAIR- SENATOR NELSON DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT QUESTION AND THEN I WILL GO TO NO OKAY SO- WE WILL GO. TO SENATOR CORTESE SENATOR COM LAGER SENATOR LAYERED SENATOR PANTS AND A WHITE CAT SCAN. THANK YOU MA'AM SURE- IN THANK YOU TO BOTH OF OUR PRESENTERS WERE- AN EXCELLENT JOB. OF GIVING US AN OVERVIEW AND I HAD A- CHANCE I'M SURE LIKE. MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES TO REVIEW SOME OF THE MATERIALS YOU WERE DRAWING FROM- JUST NOW- THE QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR THE LA- I WAS WONDERING IF HE- WOULD EXPAND A LITTLE BIT MORE. ON THE COMMENT- IN A EIGHT EXCUSE ME FOR PARAPHRASING ESPECIALLY FROM AN ACCURATE BUT THE COMMENT ABOUT. A GOING BACK IN AND LOOKING AT PROGRAMS- THAT WE CREATED- IN THE VERY RECENT PAST- FOR THE NEED FOR AUGMENTATION I THINK IS WHAT YOU WERE REALLY REFERRING TO THERE BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO CLARIFY F YOU COULD JUST GIVE EXAMPLES OF THOSE- I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT PAID SICK LEAVE RIGHT NOW- ALTHOUGH THERE. IS A JUST A PROGRAM WE CREATED ACTUALLY SUNSET ID- LANDLORD TENANT. WHICH YOU KNOW APPEARS TO. BE RUNNING NOW BASED ON SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TALKING ABOUT THOSE BECAUSE I NOTICE YOU COMBINE THAT COMMENT WITH AN EYE TOWARD. COPE WITH BEING HERE FOR A WHILE- OR OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING GETTING THE RIGHT GUIDE POSTS FROM YOU AS TO WHAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR KATIE- THAT YES THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I WAS REFERRING JUST- TO THE FACT THAT IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND THERE WERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES STARTED AND WE DON'T HAVE IN SOME IN SOME CASES IN SOME AREAS OF THE STATE BUDGET FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S WE DON'T HAVE THAT. YOU KNOW COMPLETE UP TO DATE IDEA OF HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN KIND OF ROLLING OUT SOME OF THESE INITIATIVES AND IMPLEMENTING. SOME OF THE INITIATIVES THAT HAD STARTED WERE LIKEWISE HOW THEY WOULD COORDINATE OR COMPLIMENT REALLY SOME OF THE NEW INITIATIVES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT FORWARD THIS YEAR WHICH HAVE. IN SOME CASES THAT'S SIMILAR. FOUNDING EXCEPT THE SIMILAR SOUNDING- GOAL- THE CLEAN UP WE PUT FORWARD LAST YEAR ABOUT FIFTY MILLION TO THAT- TO THAT GOAL AND- THE GOVERNOR IS NOW PROPOSING- BELIEVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THAT AND SO IT'S A VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE I THINK MANY OF US WOULD AGREE IT'S AN IMPORTANT- PROBABLY AN IMPORTANT AND NEEDED. ACTIVITY TO ACCOMPLISH BUT- WE DON'T HAVE AT THIS POINT REALLY GREAT INSIGHT TO HOW WELL HAS IT GONE WITH THE FOR THE FIRST ROUND LAST YEAR OF THE FIFTY MILLION DID. HAS THAT MONEY GONE OUT A DATE- YOU KNOW YIELDED THE RESULTS WE HAD HOPED FOR- SIMILARLY THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR THERE WERE AROUND TWENTY DIFFERENT WORK FORCE- PROPOSALS RELATED TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR'S PUTTING FORWARD AROUND TWENTY MORE SOMETIMES FROM DEMO DIFFERENT. DEPARTMENT AND IN SOME CASES THE OBJECTIVE BEING VERY SIMILAR ON THE SURFACE AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO AND YOU KNOW. TO BE FAIR. WE STILL BILL YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMEONE OF OUR INITIAL REACTION TO THE PROPOSAL SO WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH SOME OF THIS BUT I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WELL. HOW DOES THE FIRST ROUND GONE WHY WOULD WE DO IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY THIS YEAR EVER LED BY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. AND YOU KNOW- SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THE SPIRIT IN WHICH I WAS MAKING A COMMENT SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IN THE END I SHARE YOUR CONCERN AND THAT DOES SEPARATE OUT A LITTLE BIT- SORT OF BUT PERHAPS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROGRAMS. LIKE LITTER CLEANUP VERSUS- SOME OF THE COVERT IN EARLY ACTION ITEMS THAT WE DID LAST YEAR IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL. ALL STOP THERE BUT IT WILL BE GOOD TO CONTINUE TO GET- YOUR SPECIFIC THOUGHTS- AS THIS BUDGET PROCESS CONTINUES IN TERMS OF WHERE THIS IMPLEMENTATION- REPORTS. ORDERED ITALIAN RATIONS ON OUR PART SHOULD TAKE PLACE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE AND THEN I SEE IN MY REMOTE THAT SENATOR DRAWS ON SENATOR STERN. AND SENATE NOW SENATOR RICHMOND HAS HER MIKE UP TO SO LET ME JUST GO TO THE LIST REALLY QUICK. WE'RE GONNA GO COM AUGER LAYERED PAN RIGHT CASKEY DRUGS OR STERN ECKMAN GO AHEAD SENATOR CALM WATER. SHARE AND I JUST WANT TO THANK- IN ADVANCE RIGHT NOW- BUDGET STAFF- FOR THE WORK THEY'VE ALREADY DONE AND THE WORK THAT THEY WILL BE DOING. DURING THIS BUDGET SEASON SO I'M SAYING THANK YOU RIGHT NOW BUT I WILL COME BACK AND SAY THANK YOU AGAIN- AT THE END OF THIS I HAVE A QUESTION FOR- LEE L. A. O. I. NOTICE THAT- AND I'M ALSO STILL DIGESTING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BECAUSE IT'S ROBUST- HE HAS- THE BUDGET ALLOCATES QUITE A BIT OF MONEY FOR- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS AND MY QUESTION IS- I'D LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS. ON IF IT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO KIND OF CREATE AN A WELLNESS PACKAGE ON HOW WE CAN SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ACROSS THE STATE OR DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO KIND OF HAVE THOSE DOLLARS INFUSED ACROSS THE VARIOUS- DEPARTMENTS OR AGENCIES OR ISSUE AREAS. WE WANT TO FIND- BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS PERMEATING YOU KNOW EVERY WALK OF LIFE- AND WANTING TO KNOW DIFFERENT OTHER- APPROACHES TO HOW WE CAN MAYBE ADDRESS THIS I CERTAINLY THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE. FOR A WHILE FOR US- AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION TO JUST ATTACK ON TO MY- WHAT DOES SENATOR CORTESE ASKED IS KIND OF THOUGHTS ON. THAT D. OUT WE KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF WELL SO LET ME JUST ASK THE FIRST QUESTION OKAY. FOR ADULTS TO LSU YEAH. OKAY YES WELL I MEAN THE FIRST THING I MIGHT SAY IS THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE IN MORE DETAIL- I THINK I GOT THE GIST OF YOUR QUESTION BUT I MIGHT ACTUALLY- TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE- MARK NEWTON DID SEE IF- IF. HE HAD SOMETHING MORE SPECIFIC AT ALL. THE BIG QUESTION- THAT YOU YOU RAISED. SOME NEAT. YES GOOD GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MARK NEWTON- WITH THE LA- CAN IT MIGHT BE HER YES YOU'RE BEING HURT VERY GOOD YES THE SENDER BREEZES A UP. A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT PART AND SHE'S BEEN IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTEXT AND WHAT IS TRUE IS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- IS VERY BIFURCATED IN TERMS OF THE DELIVERY AND I THINK IN IN RECENT YEARS- THERE'S BEEN AN EFFORT TO SEE. TAKE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO THE TO THE ISSUE AND- IN RECOGNIZING THAT THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONNECTION WITH THAT WHICH WE CALL THROUGH THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND- AND HOMELESSNESS AND- SO I THINK THE BEAT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL DOES REFLECT. PROPOSALS THAT REFLECTS THE OVERALL TO REVIEW THERE STILL IS THE ISSUE OF IMPLEMENTATION BY- VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND- AND I THINK THERE'S ROOM FOR- ONLY HELPS EVEN MORE COORDINATED APPROACH BUT I THINK THE- THE LEGISLATION ADMINISTRATION ARE MOVING MORE STRICT IN THAT DIRECTION THERE IS A VERY VERY MAJOR INVESTMENTS- LAST YEAR IN IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THE SERVER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ARE JUST BEGINNING AND- GOT A SENATOR MENTIONED ANYTHING VERY IMPORTANT TO MONITOR. THE PROGRESS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES THERE'S NEW MONEY THIS YEAR TO SIGNIFICANT SET NEW INVESTMENT IN SORT OF BRIDGE HOUSING- BUT SET AT ALL ONLY NO I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS YOU ALLUDE TO. LOOK AT BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICE AS A- AND YOU SHOOT THAT CUTS AROSS A NUMBER OF POLICIES THROUGH VARIOUS IN A IN THE- IN- IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND WORKING TOWARDS THAT- THROUGH A. MORE CORNY. INVESTMENTS ARE- TO THE MOST IN THE ISSUE BUT WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON ON EVALUATING ISSUES. ALL RIGHT LET ME TURN THEN TO- SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF WHO BECAUSE THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES ARE HEARING TIME IS ABBREVIATED SO I'M JUST GOING TO ASK ONE QUESTION OF FINANCE IN THE ALLEY- AND JUST LET THEM KNOW THAT FAR TIME WISE ABBREVIATED. I WOULD HAVE WANTED TO DRAW THEM OUT ON THE TEACHER SHORTAGE THAT EXISTS AND SUBSTITUTE SHORTAGE ON THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR REGIONALLY SAID HE WANTED TO BUY DOWN PERSON STIRS WITH SOME OF THE- A- SURPLUS AND SEE IF YOU'RE STILL INTERESTED IN THAT. THE K. THROUGH TWELVE AND PRE K. T. K. IS EXACERBATED FACILITIES ISSUES AND HOW WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH SCHOOL FACILITIES ISSUE. AND THEN THERE'S A PROPOSAL FOR TUITION THAT'S DIFFERENT BETWEEN UC AND CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE ONE OF WE WILL LIKELY HAVE ROUGHLY TEN HEARING STARTING IN EARLY FEBRUARY AND JUST HEADS UP WILL ASK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES IN THE HEARING. THE ONE QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK OF FINANCE AND THEN- HAVE THE VALET- COMMENT. IS ENROLLMENT AT K. TWO TWELVE WAS DECLINING BEFORE. THE PANDEMIC AND THAT DECLINE HAS BEEN EXACERBATED AND THIS BUDGET PROPOSES A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE OF IT. AS A WAY TO DEAL WITH FUNDING BUT IT'S CREATING A CLIFF. AT. WE MIGHT DO ABOUT SCHOOL FINANCING RELATED TO EIGHTY A AND- THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE AND SO IT JUST DOES THE ADMINISTRATION CONTEMPLATE THAT THIS REALLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE AND HAS OTHER THINGS THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT AND WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION IS DONE. COMMENTING WITH THE LA- OFFERED THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR THERE TO THAT QUESTION- SO BASED ON THE CURRENT HOLD HARMLESS- THE CLIFF WOULD HAVE OCCURRED- NEXT YEAR AND I THINK THAT'S THE IDEA OF A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE TO USE- IN REGARDS TO EDA- IS TO PREPARE OR ALLOW FOR THE TRANSITION FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TOOK HER. OVER THE PERIOD OF THIS YEAR SO THAT SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WERE IN OUR THAT OUR RE IN A- SITUATION IN REGARDS TO DECLINING. EXTRA TIME. BASICALLY HAVE AN YEAR TO ALLOW TO- BUT APPS RIGHT- PRE PANDEMIC THERE WERE DECLINES IN ENROLLMENT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY. THE PANDEMIC AND SO THIS PROPOSAL IS TO REALLY GIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MORE TIME TO PLAN. THANK YOU AND SENATOR DAVE ANOTHER F. AND I ALSO ASKED THE LA- TO COMMENT ON THE CONTENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEANT A GREAT. YES THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR STAFF AND NOT BEING ABLE TO- GOING INTO GOING INTO THE VISUAL DETAIL THAT YOU MENTIONED IN THE UPCOMING HEARINGS BUT- YEAH I THINK OUR UNDERSTANDING AT A HIGH LEVEL AND ALL THAT AND YOUR MY COLLEAGUE- AND- DEPUTY OF THE- K. TWELVE- UNIT TO WEIGH IN AS WELL BUT- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. BE CLEAR. THAT YOU REFERRED TO WITH MUCH MORE OF AN ISSUE BEFORE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL BUT- OR A CURRENT LAW. BUT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IT WOULD BE- MITIGATED. WHAT BUT LET ME LET ME PASS IT TO EDGAR I THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO OPERATE DIGITAL- DETAIL FOR YOU. GOOD MORNING ENTER CONTROL THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IT'S JUST A COMMON COMING OF THE SHIPPING CLERK- UNDER CURRENT LAW AND WE WOULD EXPECT WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE CURRENT YEAR ATTENDANCE INFORMATION QUITE YET WHICH- LIQUOR YOUR ATTENDANCE INFORMATION IS WHAT. WOULDN'T HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT MONSTER BUT NEXT YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS BECAUSE THE KING. CLINICAL PROVISIONS THAT. COULD CREATE. FINDING FOR SCHOOL DOES AND THE GOVERNMENT WITH THINK ADDRESS. THAT ISSUE BY A COMMA YOU. IN PREVIOUS YEARS OF ATTENDANCE SO THAT THERE WOULD SOME CALCULATION OF. THE TENANTS THAT INCLUDES PRE PANDEMIC NUMBERS THAT WILL SMOOTH IT OUT I THINK. WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE PROPOSAL TO GIVE YOUR PHONE MORE COMMENTS OR SOMETHING- BUT- IT DOES SEE LIKE THE PROPOSAL WOULD. OVER TIME THANKS IT'S GOING TO BE A DECLINE IN IN THE IN ATTENDANCE OVER TIME SO THE CLINTON. HEALTHCARE FUNDING BUT IT WOULD BE MORE DRAWN OUT AND IT WOULD BE SLOWER OVER THE PERIOD. FIFTY ADDRESSED THAT ISSUE IT BECOMES LIKE WHETHER THAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH OR ONE OF THEIR OWN AT THE STILL LOOKING INTO IT WE'LL HAVE MORE ON COMMENTS YOU WE HAVE OUR- SINCE WHEN YOU'RE IN- BUT PUT IT SOMETHING THAT THE TO THE DRESS THAT PARTICULARLY RELATED TO ATTENDANCE WE DON'T ENROLLMENT HAS BEEN DECLINING- HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO DECLINE AT A FASTER RATE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WE SAW NOTHING THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO DATA TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHETHER OR NOT- STATEWIDE DATA TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT ACTORS CONTINUE. FROM INITIAL. REPORTS FROM HEARD AFTER ME. THE BATHROOM. THANK YOU SIR LET ME TURN NOW TO SENATOR PANTS I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR FINANCING A QUESTION FOR L. A. L. AND AGAIN PRECIADO PRESENTATIONS- AND I'VE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO DELVING INTO MORE DETAIL. ON SPECIALLY HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES AND BUDGETS OF THREE AND JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR- MAINTAINS COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH WITH THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION AND THIS YEAR WITH THE ON GOING COMMITMENT FOR THREE HUNDRED AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED MILLION EVERY YEAR THEREAFTER- I DID HAVE A GO AND AGAIN ALSO WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING FORWARD TO HEALTH FOR ALL MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR ALL BUT I DID HAVE A QUESTION- WHY IS THIS NOT GONNA TAKE WAYS WHERE WE BLAME. THE IMPLEMENTATION TILL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING I THINK THIS SPRING WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THE SENIORS- BUT I'M STRAIGHT UNDERSTAND AS TO WHY THE- OPPOSING THE WAY TO. TWENTY INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DO A LITTLE EARLIER- ESPECIALLY SEVERE PANDEMIC SO WE DO HAVE PEOPLE WHO NEED HEALTHCARE COVERAGE YOU NEED HEALTH CARE- AND- SO PERHAPS FINANCING FINANCE ADDRESS THAT THE ISSUE. SORRY THANK YOU SENATOR PAT- YES YOU'RE RIGHT DH CS IS WORKING- MANY PROGRAMS AT THIS POINT AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT. IN IN REGARDS TO- FORMER INVESTMENTS BUT SPECIFICALLY ON THE FIFTY PLUS. EXPANSION AND THAT WILL BE THIS. I THINK SEEING THE CLUB BASICALLY THE LONG RUNWAY- THAT IT WILL TAKE BE- ADMINISTRATION'S REALLY SIXTY SUCCESSFUL AT DELIVERING THIS PROPOSAL- PART OF IT IS STILL ALLOW FOR- SYSTEMS TO BE READY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS. IS SUCCESSFUL SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE LONG RUN. OKAY I WOULDN'T MENTION OUR EXPERIENCE BOTH WITH THE- USE THAT UNDER TWENTY SIX AND THE OTHER FIFTY I MEAN AND FACT BE ABLE TO GO OUT TO PEOPLE AND SAY WE CAN COVER EVERYONE INSTEAD OF BY PIECES ACTUALLY WOULD BE SIMPLER. SO I'M NOT SURE WHY THE BIG LONG RUNWAY SO NECESSARY IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE BUT- I APPRECIATE THAT HOPE TO DELVE INTO THAT A LITTLE MORE I ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT. THEY DID RECOGNIZE YOU DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A MONEY ISSUE TIMING WISE BUT I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT- WE WERE NOT RENEWING THE MCO TAX WHICH WOULD BE A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR- X. MEDIKAL EXPANSIONS AS WELL SO. LOOK FOR THE DELVING INTO. THE OTHER QUITE I HAVE IS IN AGAIN PC TO GOVERNOR PROPOSING. INCREASES IN SOCIAL SERVICES. AND MATT ACCOUNT EXPANSION. BUT SERVE AS THE LA- MENTIONED IN TERMS OF RESERVES WE'RE NOT ADDING ANYTHING TO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. SO WELL CERTAINLY WE DO HAVE THE ON THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE PREVIOUS YEARS. AS WE ARE INCREASING OUR COMMITMENTS AND AN IMPORTANT WE DO SELL- TO TRY TO SHIELD US FROM DOWNTURNS DURING RECESSIONS- IS THERE A REASON WHY WE'RE NOT AT. THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. THIS YEAR- I'LL JUST TAKE THAT ABOUT A HIGH LEVEL IN REGARDS TO PRESERVE I THINK THAT WE THAT RECENT RESEARCH THIS IS A GOOD IDEA I THINK WE ALSO ARE. TRYING TO BALANCE INCREASED DEPOSITS INTO THE RESERVES. AGAINST THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT AND SO ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS INTO RESEARCH HOW AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE- NOT- WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS TO. BUT SOME THAT ARE GOING FOR OTHER PRIORITIES- INTO THE RESERVES AS AS A RESULT SO IT JUST REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THAT BALANCE AGAIN I JUST WANT TO. HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE FIRST BUDGET AS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR DISCUSSION. AND HAPPY TO CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS IN THE SPRING OKAY NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND BREAK NOTE THAT PERHAPS AGAIN LIMIT WAS WRITTEN AT A TIME FOUR YOU KNOW WHERE WOULD. WE HAVE A YOU KNOW FORTUNATELY WE ARE PUTTING RESERVE SO THAT WE CAN KEEP OUR BUDGET STABLE DURING. THAT TIMES AND MAYBE THAT MEANS AN EXPLORATION OF- OF WHETHER RESERVE SHOULD BE COUNTED AGAINST THE AND LET ME KNOW WHAT THEY ARE I KNOW THE LEXUS IN LAW IS WHAT IT IS NOW PERHAPS THERE'S AN IT SHOULD BE AN EXPLORATION OF. HOW MIGHT WANT TO TALK ABOUT MODIFYING IT IN THE FUTURE AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS THE PUBLIC ABOUT IT. SO APPRECIATE THAT- AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE WANT TO CONTINUE SUPPORT SCHOOLS ARE FIGHTING COATED- BUT DIDN'T EXIST QUESTIONS FOR THE ALLEY OF IS HE DID MAKE MENTION YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS THIS ISSUE OF LONG TERM. COVE IN NINETEEN PLANNING AND I AGREE WITH YOU- WE NEED TO. NOW THIS IS SERVICE YEAR OF ABOUT. IN YEAH WELL THIRTY YEARS OF PANDEMIC AND- WE'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT BUT STARTING TO THINK ABOUT LONG TERM SO I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR THE LA- IS THAT- WHEN USED IN WHEN YOU SEARCH A LONG TERM COVERED PLANNING THANK YOU SIR MAYBE ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT YOU'RE THINKING I'LL JUST SAY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. ONE IS THAT- COLD IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY NOW HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE SURGES LIKE WE'RE SEEING THIS YEAR INVESTORS SAW LAST. MIKE IS THAT ON TOP OF FLU AND OTHER THINGS THAT NORMALLY. WILL INCREASE IN THE WINTER. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HOLD IT ON TOP EXACTLY HOW MANY. HOW LARGE IT IS I DON'T KNOW BUT- CERTAINLY IT'S GOING TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SHOULD WE BE MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IN HOSPITALS AND OTHER SO THAT. OTHERWISE WE KEEP RUNNING OUT OF BEDS EVERY WINTER- WITH EVERY TIME WE HAVE ANOTHER COVERT SEARCH. SO CELL WAS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ME SAID LONG TERM COVERED PLANNING ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WE NO LONGER HOLD IT. AS A PROBLEM. CHILLED SO THAT WOULD MEAN INCREASED INVESTMENTS AND THINGS LIKE SPECIAL EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WE HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF KIDS WITH THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT INFECTED CHILDREN DEVELOP LONG CODES ARE PERSISTENT IMPACTS WE ALSO KNOW THAT PREGNANT WOMEN WHO GET COVE IT ARE MORE LIKELY TO DELIVER I THINK THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DELIVER PREMATURELY AND AGAIN THAT'S- WITH PREMATURE- DELIVERY YOU CAN HAVE. INCREASED RATES OF. DEVELOPMENTAL AND OTHER. DISABILITIES WHICH DON'T REQUIRE AN ASSOCIATE MORE SERVICE AND THE POLICIES BUT WE DO HAVE A HEART STOPPER. OKAY OUT SO IT ALLOWS THEM TO ELLIOT EASILY I WILL OUT SO CAN YOU PLEASE ANSWER. IN THAT IT TAKES DELIBERATE ON WHAT YOU MEANT BY LONG TERM CORPORATE PLANNING THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAT I MEAN IT'S REALLY. PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS WE COULD BE THINKING ABOUT AND- AS YOU SAID I THINK WE'RE BEGINNING TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE- CORBETT PANDEMIC IS NOT LIKELY TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE YOU KNOW DEFEAT. BEHIND THE ENTIRELY. AND I RECOGNIZED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS DEVELOPED BEFORE THE OMICRON- VARIANCE WAS FULLY APPRECIATED SO THAT. THE CHALLENGE BUT- JUST AS WE CONTINUE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THIS NEW REALITY I MEAN I THINK WE'RE- WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE TYPES OF- INDIVIDUAL THE- WAR- CALIFORNIANS WHETHER IT'S- THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE OR SICK WE- DID THAT MAKE SENSE TO DO THEIR CURRENT STRUCTURE MAKES THEM. FOR THAT OF AN ENDO SITUATION- WHAT ABOUT THE SCHOOL THAN TRACKING PROTOCOLS. AND GUIDANCE SHOULD DO WE NEED TO DO CHANGES TO THE WAY WE'VE BEEN- YOU KNOW GUIDING THEM SO FAR ON THAT FRONT- WHAT ABOUT- PRISON CAPACITY IN OUR STATE PRISON. I KNOW WE'VE BEEN IN OUR OFFICE IS RECOMMENDED THAT THERE'S- THE INMATE POPULATION TO GET TRENDS TO GRASSROOTS CLOSE FACILITIES BUT- DID THAT CHANGES WE NEED TO- HOUSE B. AND MAKING A LEFT THEN ARRANGEMENT BECAUSE OF BY THESE KIND OF- VIRUSES SO. IN THAT CASE MAYBE IT CHANGES OUR OUTLOOK FOR THE PRISON CLOSURES- CHILD CARES YOU ALLUDED TO CHILDCARE IS I'D CERTAINLY. AN IMPORTANT- COMPONENT ARE A CON IN THE- SIDE OF OUR ECONOMY AND OUR LABOR FORCE WHICH IS ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO OUR INFLATION PROBLEM AND SO IF YOU. HAVE MANY WORKERS THAT ARE SIDELINED BECAUSE THEY ACTED YOU KNOW PROVIDE CHILDCARE BECAUSE OF SIDE CLOSURES IN- YOU KNOW PRESCHOOL OR DAYCARE. THEN YOU SAID THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO RESPOD TO THAT SO IT IS A QUESTION LIKE THAT I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE NECESSARILY HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS AT THIS TIME BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE- THINKING CAREFULLY ABOUT. THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES AS WE GO FORWARD IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS. I THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH FOR SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES. SENATOR Y. CASKEY THAT'S GOING TO BE. SENATOR DRAWS ARE SENATOR STERN DIRECT ANCESTOR MEN. MANAGER ON FILE ALL FOLLOW THE FINE EXAMPLE OF THE CHAIR OF SEPT ONE ON EDUCATION AND JUST GIVE A HEADS UP MISS LEON TO FINANCE AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE. LAST YEAR ON WILDFIRES IN- PREVENTION RESILIENCY THE SENATE PROPOSED A FIVE YEAR FIVE BILLION DOLLAR SPENDING PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS. FOR PREVENT. THE GOVERNOR HAS A TWO PROBE- WE READ IN THE PAPER TODAY THE COMMITMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT ON THE FOR SERVICE AND TREATING THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR WHAT FUEL REDUCTIONS HAPPEN AFTER. THAT WE'RE DOING HOW MANY ACRES TO STATE STREET LAST YEAR ARE WE ON TRACK WITH THIS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. ACRES ANNUALLY THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TREATING AND THIS HOW MUCH OF THIS. YOU IN THAT YOU ARE PROPOSING IS CRITICAL TOWARDS FUEL REDUCTION IN THE DROUGHT RICK ARENA WE'RE GOING TO- YOU KNOW I'M VERY CURIOUS. BUT THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY ALSO WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THE DROUGHT RESPONSE PACKAGE THAT WE DID FROM THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO PACKAGE. HOW DID THE ACTIVITIES THAT YOU COULD CONDUCT WITH THE PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DIFFER FROM THOSE ON NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS EXTREME HEAT AND COASTAL RESILIENCY WE HAD. A GOOD DOWN PAYMENT LAST YEAR THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION BUT THERE'S SOME OVER. PLEASE SUBSCRIBE PROJECTS LIKE THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM AND THE URBAN A COMMITTEE FOR ST YOU HAVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION PROPOSED THERE. WE SEE WE UNDERSTAND FROM THE RESTORATION THAT THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION IN DEMAND FROM THAT THIS IS SIMPLY THESE ARE TO LOWER THE COST OF UTILITIES FOR THESE RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDE A MORE HABITABLE COMFORTABLE LIVING QUARTERS SO WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT.% WHAT YOU CAN. CREATE INCREASING FUNDING FOR L. W. I. P. ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I HAVE YET TO SEE ANY PEACE B. C. P. CENTER FOR MAINTENANCE IN THE RESOURCE AREA. WE KNOW THAT THE BACKLOG AT LEAST JUST IN THE PARKS WAS ONE POINT TWO MILLION BUT- ALL I SAW WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR ART INSTALLATIONS SO I GOT A QUESTION WITH THAT. AND YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU HAVING CONSERVANCIES THE SENATE HAD FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION THAT WE WANT TO PUT A CONSERVANCY STILL. TO THIS IMPORTANT CLIMATE WORK YOU'VE GOT THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN OVER TWO YEARS TO BE SPLIT BETWEEN FIVE CONSERVANCIES AND- WERE THERE ANY LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED LAST YEAR. IN A ROW I KASKY SORRY BUT ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT EITHER THE LA- OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO RESPOND TO RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE TOP ON THE FUEL REDUCTIONS HOW MANY ACRES AT THE STATE STREET LAST YEAR AND ARE WE ON TRACK TO MEET THE GOAL OF FIVE HUNDRED. MILLION ACRES ANNUALLY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GREAT LET'S HAVE THEM. THAT AN FIRM IN FINANCE S. THANK YOU THE COST CENTER I MEAN IT'S NOT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE IN OUR RESOURCES. MORNING STEVEN BENSON APARTMENT FINANCE SENDIRI CASKET FOR TRYING TO HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER READY LEGAL FROM THE NUMBER OF ACRES TREATED LAST YEAR WILL DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP WITH FOLKS YOU CAN GET THAT FOR YOU BE READY FOR THAT- IN TERMS OF BEING ON TARGET TO REACH THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE BALL BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE OUR CONVERSATIONS YOU HAD WITH RESOURCES. AND OTHERS YES THAT WE ARE ON TRACK TO DO THAT. ALL RIGHT M. BUT THANK YOU CENTER A CASTING FOR GIVING THEM THE PREVIEW OF THE THING SHE WILL BE EXPECTING WHICH- SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING START. SO NOW LET ME TURN TO SENATOR DRAWS SO YOU'RE ON THE REMOTE SO PLEASE JUST- I THINK. YOU WERE ON MUTED SO IT'LL GO AHEAD YES WE CAN HEAR YOU GO AHEAD. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- COLLEAGUES- I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF ISSUES. BASED ON ONE OF THIS. ONE OF THE YOUR COMMENTS- AND THAT IS THAT WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE THOSE- ISSUES PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS UNDERLYING PROBLEMS. UNDERLYING PROBLEMS- LAST YEAR. FOUR MILLION WORKERS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE PAID SICK LEAVE. AND THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE EMPLOYER THRESHOLD. WE'RE TELLING WORKERS STAY HOME WHEN YOU'RE SICK. BUT WE ARE NOT SETTING UP THE RULES IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY CAN STAY HOME WHEN THEY'RE SICK SO I'M VERY CONCERNED- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR PUTTING A SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE AS AN ISSUE FOR EARLY ÒION I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE EMPLOYERS THAT WOULD BE COVERED- IT MIGHT MY DISTRICT AND DRAW LOS ANGELES THERE'S- PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES BUT I DON'T MEAN SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE YOU KNOW A HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED. I MEAN A SMALL BUSINESSES THAT REALLY EXIST FOR THEIR OWN SURVIVAL AND SURVIVAL OF THE FEW WORKERS THAT WORK FOR THEM- THE SMALLER THE BUSINESSES AND THIS IS JUST ME I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT IT'S LESS LIKELY THAT THESE EMPLOYEES HAVE A SAFETY NET IS LESS LIKELY IT'S MORE LIKELY. YOU KNOW THERE ARE MINIMUM WAGE IF AT ALL. BLACK LATINO AND- WOMEN. API THEY'RE NOT LIKELY TO HAVE DONE THE STIMULUS CHECK OR ARE YOU I MEAN- WE'RE SETTING THE RULES HERE ON TO EXCLUDE THEM- AND THEN WE WONDER WHY THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH- EQUITY OUT WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE WHO ARE POOR AND THOSE WHO. DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SO I REALLY WANT TO- YOU KNOW. HOPEN ASKED ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE- YO KNOW 80% OF ALL WORKERS- WORK FOR A BUSINESS THAT'S LESS THAN TWENTY. EMPLOYEES SO- AGAIN THIS I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE REACTING TO EQUITY ISSUES WE ALWAYS START TRYING TO COVER YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE FACT AFTER PEOPLE DIE AFTER PEOPLE ARE HOSPITALIZED. IN THESE COMMUNITIES OF WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE RULES IN ADVANCE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE ALSO THE ADMINISTRATION- ON THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE. AND SENATOR PAN'S COMMENTS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- DRAWS OR DID YOU WANT EITHER LA OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO RESPOND OR DID YOU WANT TO MAIL MOSTLY LEAVE THOSE AS COMMENTS. EACH OTHER MOSTLY IS COMMON AT THEIR JUMPING OUT OF THEIR CHAIRS AND THEY WANT TO SAY SOMETHING. HE THE DEPARTMENT STORE HAD IT YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS VERY INTERESTED IN IT EARLY AFTER MARKETS ON LEAVE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS AT THE LEGISLATURE WILL NOW TURN TO SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY COMING THROUGH OKAY YES YOU ARE. OKAY GREAT- MAKE COUPLE QUICK COMMENTS AND THEN JUST ONE QUESTION- ONE ECHO- MY COLLEAGUES' INTERCOM LOGGER THERE ARE STILL UNPAID SICK LEAVE IN A PRIORITY AIR AND REALLY LOOKING. TO GO SMALL ENOUGH FORCE WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN THEIR OWN HEALTH AND SAFETY AND- THEIR LIVELIHOOD- TEXAS SO HE DESTROYS WE SHOULDN'T BE FORCING ANYBODY TO MAKE RIGHT NOW- ALSO JUST A QUICK COMMENT ON ON THE CLIMATE BUDGET. THRILLED ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE ADDITION- THE GOVERNOR'S SHOWN SO STRONGLY APPLAUD HIM INTERESTED MINISTRATIONS FOR GOING BIG EARRINGS A SMART TIME TO BE SPENDING IN THAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE. REGARDLESS WHEN WASHED IN THE SINK DO I WOULD JUST PUT A NOTE IN MY MIND pABOUT APRIL TWENTY COMES TO WILDFIRE ABOUT PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE HOW MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE ACTING NOT JUST ME ACRES ARE WE TREATING- I JUST RAISE- EXTREME HEAT IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY ALSO IN BUILDING IT RETROFITS AND THE HOTTEST PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE PEOPLE ARE.% SUFFERING AND OFTEN DYING IN IN HEATING AND HEAT AFTER THAT MAKES- THE THIRTY BY THIRTY PLAN WE REALLY GOT A LOOK AT OUR CONSERVANCIES AND USE THEM. FOR ONE OTHER FINE. COMMENT FOR MY IS- ON THE NEW HOME- AND SNACKS AND- CARE REALLY HOPING WE CAN STAY UP AND HELP. YOUR STAFFING RATIOS READY AND PAY THOSE WORKERS WHAT THEY DESERVE BECAUSE THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR SENIORS AND LOVED ONES. ABOUT MY ONE QUESTION IS- TO ART TO. ERICA OR SOMEONE A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THERE ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH QUESTION I APPRECIATE CENTER COM LONGER RAISING IT. HE'S BEEN LEADING ON THIS AS WELL BUT YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT S. FOR HOW- SEVEN Q. OR Q. CARE BEDS. OTHER WORDS HOW HOW MUCH HOUSING THAT pOUT OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET ACTION BECAUSE I KNOW EVERY COUNTY IS STARVING FOR- THOSE RESOURCES TO GO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING ON THE STREETS AND HAVING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES. YOU KNOW IT'S SORT OF AROUGH ESTIMATE OF- HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU THINK WILL WILL BE OUT OF THIS THIS BUDGET. THANK YOU SENATORS I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER WITH ME I'M GONNA TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE ADVERSITY SEE IF YOU CAN FILL IN- IF NOT WE CAN GET WE CAN GET YOU. AN ESTIMATED FIGURE. THIS IS ADAM GARCIA FINANCE YEAH I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER OF BIDS IN FRONT OF ME BUT ONCE YOU COME UP WITH. OKAY THANKS. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN- LET ME TURN NOW TO SENATOR EDMUND. BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE CENTER- AND THANK YOU TO DR PAN WHO ASK THE QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK ALSO AROUND THE UNDOCUMENTED AND LIKE WE COULDN'T JUST START ALL OF THAT NOW ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO BRING UP THIS ISSUE AROUND WORK FORCE THAT I'M GLAD THE ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSING ON. AND WE KNOW THAT AT WORK FORCE CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE IN AS WE PROVIDE MORE COVERAGE TO MORE PEOPLE AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO MATCH THE SERVICES THAT WERE PROMISING FOLKS- I WOULD BUY IT SO THAT WAS MY- MY ONE QUESTION. I LOOK FORWARD TO ORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE L. A. O. ON DOING A LOT OF OVERSIGHT- AS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY STATED WE DID A- WHOLE LOT OF STUFF LAST YEAR AND I THINK WE'RE WE'RE YOU KNOW WE WERE. WE WERE AS A BUILDING THE PLANE WHILE WE'RE FLYING AND THEN THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA TRY TO DO THE TUNE UP AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY. SO WE'RE WORKING THAT INTO OUR HEARINGS NOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME OVERSIGHT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ASKED FOR LAST YEAR. IN REGARDS TO SENATOR STERN QUESTION ABOUT. BUT THE NUMBER OF BEDS NEEDED THAT WAS. AND SO AS WERE AS WE'RE ARE PROVIDING MORE SERVICES AND PUTTING MORE MONEY OUT I THINK WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THE ANALYTICS AND THE DATA THAT WE'VE COLLECTED. AND MAKING SURE WE'RE- THAT. THAT THE MONEY WE'RE SPENDING IS ACTUALLY GOING WHERE WE WANT IT. THE DEPARTMENT WAS ASKED TO COME UP WITH. AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE ACTUAL NEED WAS IT WAS VERY HARD TO GET OUR- ARMS AROUND NO ONE SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO TELL US HOW MANY BEDS WE NEED IT BUT THE WHOLE CONTINUUM OF CARE. AND SO I KNOW. THAT WE WERE ASKED FOR THAT AND WAS WAS WE DO LAST. NOVEMBER I THINK IT CAME OUT IN. JANUARY EARLY. RECENTLY HE IS THERE SOMEBODY WHO CAN SPEAK TO THE GAP THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY FACING- EIGHT. IN THE AREA IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. IN THE EVALUATION THAT WA DONE STATEWIDE. OF OUR OF OUR COUNTIES. AND THEN. SO THAT THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION SO LET ME HAVE- I THINK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. PRESS THAT. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SATURDAY AGAIN I'M GOING TO TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE ADVERSITY FOR SOMEWHERE TO TELL. YEAH THIS IS ADAM WHO WAS THE FINANCE SIDE IS VERY GOOD QUESTION- I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT- WE HAVE THAT NUMBER- BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT- WE WILL LOOK INTO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S HARD TO KNOW IF WE GET THERE IF WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY. WHERE WE'RE GOING- SO I LOOK FORWARD TO TALK TO TALKING FURTHER AND REALLY LOOKING AT THAT DATA SEEING WHAT WE'VE DONE WHAT'S OUT THERE WHAT WE STILL NEED TO DO AND THEN. HOW WE ACTUALLY CLOSE. THAT GAP- AND ONE THING I WILL SAY- IN REGARD TO HAVE SOME MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SPOKEN AT. THE END WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION'S HERE IT WOULD BE A GREAT YEAR FOR A SPECIAL SESSION ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN THE CONTAINER OF CARE- WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT WAS IN HERE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST SO MUCH. TO BE DONE SO MUCH INTEREST IN IT THAT IT IS VERY HARD TO DO IN THE IN THE MIDST OF IT EVEN MORE COMING. ON AS WE TRY TO JUGGLE WITHOUT A REAL FOCUS ON THAT SO AGAIN JUST TO. PUT IT OUT THERE IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF SPECIAL SESSION WILL BEGIN ACTUALLY FOCUS ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN THE FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE- AS IT RELATES TO ALL OF OUR- POPULATIONS AND THEN JUST. AN OBSERVATION- AND- OF COURSE WE KNOW THERE'S NO. CAUSATION OR CORRELATION BUT I WILL JUST MAKE AN OBSERVATION- THAT WHEN WE DID AWAY WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH I BELIEVE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IS WHEN IT WENT AWAY FOR GOOD- AND I WOULD JUST OFFER THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS IMPROVED. SINCE WE GOT RID OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH I LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU CENTER AGREED FOR THE QUESTIONS AND ALSO FOR OF COURSE- ALERTING. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID DELEO WHOSE OFFICE WHAT. SOME OF THE- QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE DELVING INTO YOU AS YOU START YOUR HEARINGS- ALL RIGHT SO WE HAD- SENATOR MEN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR NIELSEN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN THIS BUDGET- BUT OBVIOUSLY S. AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE POINTED OUT THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT THIS- IN COURSE IS A GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE WHEN YOUR DOCUMENT EXTRA FUNDS. I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE AND SENATOR STERN ABOUT THE SCOPE OF TIME INVESTMENT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ON INFRASTRUCTURE I WAS ALSO REALLY PLEASED TO SEE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT TAX CREDITS THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING- TO HELP DEVELOP ROUTINE ARE INDEED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE U. SEES FOR GREEN RD IN THIS IT'S BEEN SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS SO- YOU KNOW I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT BECAUSE I THINK. WHILE MANDATES TO PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT MARKET SIGNAL WE ALSO NEED TO KIND OF PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS AND GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE ADAPTATION OF DEVELOPMENT- I THINK PROVIDING FUNDING FOR R&amp;D IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL I'M ALSO PLEASED TO SEE SO MUCH FUNDING GOING TO THE BASE- INCREASES HERE FOR THE NEW SEASONS YES USE- AS WELL AS THE CAL GRANTS IN AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE HEARINGS WILL HAVE ON THAT AND BUDGET SUB ONE. MY QUESTION HERE IS YOU KNOW IN ANOTHER GREAT THING I THINK IS BUT IT'S DOING IS IT'S PAYING DOWN MORE OF OUR PENSION LIABILITIES I AND- YEAH I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT JUST SO THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH A PROBLEM DOWN THE LINE AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO WITH THE ONE TIME SURPLUS THE KIND OF PAY DOWN OUR FUTURE LIABILITIES ONE QUESTION I HAD IS AN ALLUSION TO THIS IN THE REPORT THAT WE RECEIVED IN LA- SO THIS COULD BE L. A. O. OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT- I DID IT BECAUSE OF INCREASED RETURNS ON. THE STOCK MARKETS AND WHATNOT THAT ARE DRIVING SOME OF OUR TAX REVENUES- THAT WE SEEN A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES- IN THE PROJECTED RETURNS NEEDED TO REACH- BREAK EVEN POINT I WAS ONE OF EITHER YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT- DEPARTMENT FINANCER LA- AS FAR AS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN IN CANISTERS AND PURRS ON A RATE OF RETURN HAD. WE DO LAST YEAR AND HOW DOES THAT IMPACT OUR LONG TERM- PICTURE WITH HAWKING. MIGHT I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER MEN AND ANY TO THAT BOTH- HACKSAW RETURNS IN THE 20% LAST YEAR SO STOP HERS HAD ANY- TWENTY ONE POINT 3% RETURN- AND STURRIDGE HAD EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN POINT 2% RETURN SO- JUST IN IN REGARDS TO WHAT THAT MEANS TO THE SYSTEM- AS AN EXAMPLE HERS IS UNFUNDED LIABILITY- SIXTY THREE BILLION AND IT IS. UP PRIOR TO- FIVE DID YOU KNOW THAT THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE POINT 3% INCREASE IT WAS 70% AND NOW AFTER THE ACCOUNT FOR THAT RETURN IT'S GOING TO BE 80% SO THAT'S THAT'S A- BOOK THAT THE POSITIVE IMPACTS TO PURCHASE AND- I'M STIRS THE STATION THAT WE HAVE- SO WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT CONTRIBUTING ADDITIONAL PROP TO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT. THE ESTIMATES RIGHT. NOW IS THAT THE STATE SHARE- HAPPEN. SO THOSE ARE RESULTS OF THE WORK THAT WERE FOR MONSTERS IF YOU NEED TO THEIR INVESTMENTS EXACTLY. LIKE A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN. MR PATRICK I SEE AT THE END OF. YES THANK YOU SENATOR MAN AT THE GOOD QUESTION AND THEN I THINK- YOU KNOW THE THING THAT WE WOULD JUST POINT OUT IS THAT. INTERNAL BILITY CURRENTLY REPRESENT SOMEWHAT OF A TRADE OFF THE TENSIONS ARE GENERALLY IN BETTER SHAPE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM FINANCE JUST SAD- AND SO THE TRADE UP WE THINK IS PROBABLY THAT. PUTTING MORE IN RESERVE IS PROBABLY. A BETTER PLACE AT THE MOMENT- THE HIGHER RATE OF RETURN THEN IN CALPERS. ALLOWED THE BIG HELPERS SIT IN TO TAKE A STEP TO REDUCE ITS ASSUMPTION WHEN IT COMES TO FUTURE RATE OF RETURN WHICH IS PROBABLY. A YOU KNOW A HEALTHY HEALTHY STEP- AND SO IT THAT'S GOOD THE- ACTUARIES ESTIMATE THAT THE CHARACTERS LIABILITY THE STATE PORTION OF THE LIABILITY. AS WELL AS JEFF SAID WILL BE ELIMINATED WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS. I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO FAR INTO THE DETAILS IN THIS DISCUSSION BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S SOME CAUSE FOR CONCERN. I WANT TO TAKE. THERE'S SOME THING TO BE AWARE ABOUT WITH THAT AND THAT IS THAT IF THE CHARACTERS EIGHT LIABILITY DOES BECOME ELIMINATED THE- NUL CONTRIBUTION WILL WILL DECLINE STATUTORILY. SUCH THAT THEN IN THE FUTURE IF WE HAVE IT THE NEW LIABILITY BECAUSE OF THE MARKET DOWNTURN FOR EXAMPLE. WE WILL BE CONTRIBUTING POTENTIALLY LESS THAN IT NEEDED TO RETIRE THE LIABILITY BY THE TWENTY FORTY SIX- COOL SO- WE'VE WRITTEN A REPORT ABOUT THAT AND- THINK IT WARRANTS SOME LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION. BUT IN GENERAL OF COURSE THE HIGH RATE OF RETURN THAT WERE EARNED BY THE SYSTEM THIS YEAR IS A VERY POSITIVE THING IF IT HAD PUT THOSE SYSTEMS ON ON- BETTER FOOTING. AND I DON'T I WILL ALSO JUST NOTE THAT UNDER PROPOSITION TWO. THERE'S ABOUT THREE AND A HALF BILLION IN SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTION GOING TO CALPERS AND- IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL SO THAT'S ALSO VERY FAVORABLE SO- ANYWAY THE HOPEFULLY THAT'S HELPFUL. IT THANK YOU SENATOR MINUTE THANK YOU BARMOUTH FINANCE AND- MR PADDOCK FOR LA- FOR THE ANSWERS SENATOR NIELSEN PRESENTS IT APPEARS THAT THERE'S NOT MANY MANY CLOSURES THIS YEAR I'M NOT SURE BUT IT APPEARS THAT WAY. A POINT WAS MADE EARLIER THAT. WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS. WITH THE EPIDEMIC RAGING THROUGH OUR PRISONS NOW THE HEALTH. IN TERMS OF CLOSING MORE FACILITIES AT PORT CLOSURES SOME OF THE OPTIONS OF SPACE AND TREATMENT THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE TO OUR INMATES. IN OUR PRISONS. IN TERMS OF THE- FORESTS WILDLAND MANAGEMENT I'VE CHARACTERIZED AS SUCH. I'D LIKE TO GET FEEDBACK FROM THE RESOURCES AGENCY IF FUNDS WILL BE DIRECTED. TOWARDS COGENERATION IN OTHER WORDS A SOURCE OF FACILITIES WITHIN THOSE RURAL AREAS THE FORCE IN THE WILD LANDS FOR BY SOME OF THE FUEL CAN BE REMOVED. THROUGH COGENERATION. SEEMS TO BE A DEAFENING SILENCE ABOUT THAT. AND ALSO AS WE DIRECT OUR EFFORTS TOWARDS FOREST AND WILDLAND MANAGEMENT. I ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. THE FOCUS ON DIRECTING THOSE RESOURCES TO THE MOST ACCOUNTABLE AND RESPONSIVE AREAS THAT I THINK ARE HELPING US MANAGE THOSE FORESTS AND WILDLANDS. THOSE ARE THE COUNCIL'S THAT ARE FORMED IN EACH COMMUNITY. AND WHERE THEY HELP US AND THEY SHOULD BE HELPING DIRECT WHERE THOSE RESOURCES ARE PLACED NOT JUST THE RESOURCES AGENCIES. THE I ALSO WOULDN'T TREAT AND THE REPUBLICANS HAVE ASKED FOR A SPECIAL SESSION ON HOMELESSNESS TERMS OF DEALING WITH THE HOMELESS. WE NEED TO BE NOT JUST PROVIDING SHELTER. BUT WE NEED TO APPLY RESOURCES TO ADDRESSING AND ASSESSING ASSESSING THE NEEDS OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION WHO ARE HOMELESS IN THEPROPER TREATMENT FOR HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT IN THE PAST WE'VE PROVIDE LIKE IN OUR HOME WAS SEPARATE TO THE ABSTRACT ART. COME INTO A ROOM WITH A TAKE BACK AT THE END JUST START SPLASHING ON THE WALLS BUT WE REALLY NOT FOCUSED. ON WHAT WILL BE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY. THE DEAL FOR THE HOMELESS POPULATION AS IN IDENTIFYING THEIR OTHER NEEDS NOW I COMPLIMENTED THE GOVERNOR FOR AN END TO THE DEPARTMENTS FOR STARTING TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT. ON THAT NOW. THAT IT'S MORE THAN JUST PROVIDING SHELTER OR AN APARTMENT OR A- OFTEN ACQUIRED FACILITY- HOLD HOTEL OR MOTEL. AT THERE SEEMS TO BE A RECOGNITION THAT ARE FOREVER GOING TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE HOLISTIC ISSUE. OF THE HEALTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. AND THE OTHER ADDICTION NEEDS AND SUCH- THIS HOMELESS. POPULATION THAT IS I THINK ENCOURAGING TO ME IS THIS BUDGET IS CONTEMPLATED. I HAVE A GREAT AND DEVOTE TODAY OF THE RAINY DAY FUND. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE US NOT THE RAINY DAY FUND. THAT WAS A LONG TIME IN COMING. THE FINDING OF THE RAINY DAY FUND. IN ONE OF THE GREAT VALUES OF THE RAINY DAY FUND HAS BEEN A BIT OF A RESTRAINT ON SPENDING. EFFECTED BY TAKING THOSE DOLLARS. WELL BEYOND THE REACH OF THE LEGISLATURE TO SPEND OR THE ADMINISTRATION TO SPEND. ANOTHER QUESTION THAT DOES NEED TO BE EXAMINED. THIS IS ABOUT THE SHORTAGE OF JUDGES. THERE'S TREMENDOUS AND I CONSIDERED VERY NEGATIVE CHANGES GOING ON IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE RIGHT NOW RESULTING IN FAR FEWER PROSECUTIONS. OR USERS OF THE COURT REFERENCING HIS REHABILITATION I PARTICULARLY I'M TALKING HERE ABOUT THE COURT. WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT. AND IT'S A CURIOSITY TO ME THAT WE ARE NOT TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT HIGH SPEED RAIL. THE IMMENSE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE HAVING TO MAKE TOWARDS THIS HIGH SPEED RAIL. THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO IN ANY WAY IN THE FUTURE BE DIRECTED TOWARDS WHERE THE POPULATION IS. AND I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE EXAMINED VERY THOROUGHLY. IN THIS BUDGET. THE SCREWED ME OF THE BUDGET AND THE OVERSIGHT. ABILITIES OF THE LEGISLATION THROUGH THE BUDGET COMMITTEE I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE LEGISLATURE PUT TO THE SENATE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF ACCEPTING A GREATER ROLE IN OVERSIGHT. OF THE AGENCIES IN DEPTH OVERSIGHT. IN CHANGING HOW THE AGENCIES THE BUSINESS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO HAVE A PROCLIVITY TO IS TO FORM A NEW AGENCIES ALBEIT MAYBE SMALLER ONES. BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROLIFERATION. ALMOST ALL OF THESE WILL BUILD THE BASE. OF OUR BUDGETS IN THE FUTURE. TRADING EXPECTATIONS IN OBLIGATIONS. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO MADAM CHAIR PUT THOSE THINGS- TO OUR ATTENTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON ALL TAKE THOSE AS COMMENTS FOR- FOR CON FOR US TO CONSIDER VERSUS SOMETHING YOU WANT TO DIRECT RESPONSE FROM EITHER LA OR DELAY LET ME GO TO SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM FOUGHT CHERUB PJ THE OPPORTUNITY JUST MINE ARE JUST COMMENTS I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT WILL BE OBVIOUSLY HAVING HEARINGS ON A LOT OF THIS- BUT I REALLY WANT TO THINK- BOTH THAT- FINANCE AND THE LA- FOR THE DETAILED INFORMATION- I APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR OVERSIGHT M. IN NEW PROGRAMS I FEEL- THAT THE PROGRAM'S ROLLOUT DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. AND THEY CREATE SOME EQUITY ISSUES AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE- CONTINUE TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE HELP AND THAT. ALL COMMUNITIES SHARE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS THOSE FUNDS- AND I'M SPEAKING OBVIOUSLY OF THE RURAL- ISOLATED COMMUNITIES REALLY HAVE A HARD TIME ACCESSING SOME OF THESE RESOURCES BECAUSE OF THAT- CIRCUMSTANCES AND HOW THEY WERE SET UP. AND I APPRECIATE THE CAUTION ABOUT NOT STARTING ANY NEW PROGRAMS AND UNTIL WE KNOW- IF THE NEW MONEY THAT WE PUT ON THE TABLE LAST YEAR IS- ACTUALLY WORKING TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT. THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED NEED TO BE ARMED. A SOFT AND- AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONTINUED TRYING TO CREATE NEW DEPARTMENTS BOARDS OR DIVISIONS- IN BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEES IS BUILT. ON SO I'M GONNA LOOK AT THAT PRETTY CAREFULLY PART OF THE CHALLENGES THEN WE DON'T KNOW REALLY HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE GONNA ROLL OUT. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHALLENGE THEM IN POLICY COMMITTEES. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE ARE GOING TO WORK ONE A SECOND WHAT WAS JUST SAID ABOUT THE RAINY DAY FUND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT. ELEMENT IN OUR BUDGET AND- BOTH OF THE LEARNING CENTER AND I WERE AROUND DURING THE TIME THAT WE MADE SOME OF THE WORST BUDGET CUTS IN OUR- THE STATE'S HISTORY AND- WE'RE PAINFULLY AWARE THE FACT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THOSE DAYS- CLEARLY OUR INVESTMENTS ARE DOING WELL. BECAUSE INVESTMENTS IN THE STOCK MARKET ARE DOING WELL OVERALL. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR OUR BUDGET BUT WHEN- THE ECONOMY SOFTENS THAT'S WHEN WE START TO SEPARATE WE'RE GONNA NEED- THOSE. THOSE RESOURCES I ALSO WANNA. ONE OF THE FOOTNOTES I WANT TO SAY ON ON THAT CREATING NEW PROGRAMS AND- AND- AND THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT IN THE AREA OF HOUSING- I THINK THERE'S SOME REAL NEED FOR- SOME OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. IN TERMS OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE ROLLING OUT- AND A REAL. UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF COMBATING HOMELESSNESS- WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY OUT AND I'M NT SURE WE'RE SEEING THE RESULTS OF IT I'D LIKE TO HEAR THAT WE ARE BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT I VISITED. AND MANY OF THE SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN NOT ABLE TO ACCESS RESOURCES IN TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR HOMELESS PROBLEM AND FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE GAME AND NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS ANYTIME WE INVEST MONEY IN DOWNTOWN M. INFILL. THE PROJECTS WERE GOING TO GO ABOVE. TWO STORIES THE- COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE ROBUST. PUBLIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT. REQUIRE NEW PUMPER TRUCKS AND SO THEY'RE CONSTRAINED TO ONLY BUILD UP TO TWO STORIES INSTEAD OF GOING HIGHER AND I THINK. SO AS A CONSEQUENCE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE FUNDS MY POINT AND ALL OF THAT IS THAT WE HAVE SOME BARRIERS. AND I'M NOT SURE WE'RE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION HOW TO GET AROUND THOSE BARRIERS ARE HOW TO SOLVE THEM. AND THAT'S THE- PURPOSE OF HAVING POLICY COMMITTEES. THAT CAN INVITE. INFORMATION FROM OUR OUR PARTNERS THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES AND WE CAN DO IT RIGHT AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO AND- BEFORE I TURN TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT- I THINK MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. OUR RECOGNIZED THAT WHILE WE HAVE ANOTHER HEALTHY REVENUE YEAR. THAT WE APPROVED- SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SPENDING ON NEW PROGRAMS LAST YEAR AND WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE ARE. BEING ABLE TO BE DELIVERED AND SO THAT OVERSIGHT FUNCTION THAT WE ALSO HAVE IN ADDITION TO. BRING THE BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US THAT OVERSIGHT FUNCTION SO WE HAVE A LOT ON OUR PLATES FOR THIS YEAR. AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN INCORPORATE SOME OF THAT OVERSIGHT IN OUR HEARING PROCESS BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AND YOU FALL RACING VERY LEGITIMATE- QUESTIONS. I'M NOW BUT- WE- I AM HESITANT. I THINK WE WILL GO TILL TWELVE TEN JUST TO ALLOW AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES OF PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAD A HARD STOP OF. TWELVE BUT I THINK WE COULD EXTEND IT FOR THE TEN MINUTES BUT LET'S MODERATOR PLEASE- YOU COULD Q. FOLKS UP IN LET'S TAKE FIFTEEN MINUTES OF PUBLIC COMMENT.
