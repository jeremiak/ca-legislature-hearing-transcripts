I WANT TO RECOGNIZE PRESIDENT PRO TEM SENATOR ATKINS FOR GEORGE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND ORDINARILY WE MIGHT DO- THIS UNDER ADJOURNMENTS BUT IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG DAY AND I FELT LIKE IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO START. WITH AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT UNDER PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR BECAUSE OUR EYES SENATE FAMILY HAS LOST ONE OF OUR OWN. WE LEARNED YESTERDAY AND I WANT TO THANK OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE SENATOR ANTHONY CANNELLA FOR REACHING OUT AND LET ME KNOW THAT WE HAD LOST SENATOR TOM BERRYHILL. AND I KNOW THAT A COUPLE OF OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ARE GONNA ARE GONNA COMMENT. AND WHILE WE ARE BUSY TODAY. YOU KNOW I OFTEN THINK THAT WHEN WE LOSE SOMEONE THE WORLD SHOULD PAUSE FOR A MOMENT WE SHOULD TAKE A MINUTE. AND REFLECT ON THE LIFE OF SOMEONE THAT MEANT A GREAT DEAL TO- TO US PERSONALLY AND TO ON THE SENATE FAMILY. TIME SERVED TWELVE YEARS IN THE LEGISLATURE HE IS A FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND HE WAS OUR RECENT COLLEAGUE HERE IN THE SENATE. A REPUBLICAN HE REPRESENTED ASSEMBLY DISTRICT TWENTY FIVE FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX TO TWENTY TEN. AND THE EIGHTH SENATE DISTRICT FROM TWENTY TEN THROUGH TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ALL THIS AFTER HAVING UNDERGONE A HEART TRANSPLANT BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO KNEW TOM HE KNEW HE HAD A HEART FOR CALIFORNIA AND ITS PEOPLE. EVEN AFTER LEAVING THE SENATE HE CONTINUED IN PUBLIC SERVICE REPRESENTING CONSTITUENTS AT THE STANISLAUS COUNTY SUPERVISOR DESPITE HAVING ALSO BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. HE WAS A FARMER A BUSINESSMAN A DEVOTED LEGISLATOR. HE WAS A DECENT HUMAN BEING AND SOMEONE THAT WE ALL LIKE TO WORK WITH A CIVIL MANNER A GENTLEMAN. I ENJOYED VERY MUCH SERVING ON RULES WITH HIM AND EVEN AS SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY WHEN WE HAD TO COMMUNICATE AMONGST MEMBERS I AM BOTH HOUSES I ALWAYS FOUND HIM TO BE ONE OF THE MOST DILIGENT AND THOUGHTFUL. INDIVIDUALS IN REPRESENTING NOT ONLY HIS CONSTITUENTS BUT BE A PART OF THIS BODY HE LOVED THE LEGISLATURE HE HAD A GREAT RESPECT. FOR IT AND SO I KNOW THAT EVERYONE HERE WILL EXTEND OUR DEEPEST SYMPATHIES TO HIS WIFE LORETTA. HIS DAUGHTERS JESSICA AND SAMANTHA HIS BROTHER IN OUR OTHER FORMER COLLEAGUES. IN THE ASSEMBLY BILL BERRY HILL BUT ALSO TO THE ENTIRE FAMILY AND- SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE MR PRESIDENT WE TURN IT OVER. TO OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TO ALSO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT OUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR BURIAL. SINNER GIRL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND IT IS- WITH GREAT SADNESS THAT WE STAND HERE TODAY AND WE TALK ABOUT OUR COLLEAGUE AND OUR FRIEND I'M TOM BERRY HILL YOU KNOW WE WEREIN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SESSION YESTERDAY WHEN WE GOT THE NOTIFICATION THAT HE HAD PASSED AWAY AND GONE TO HEAVEN. AND I THINK ABOUT HIS LEGACY IN WHAT HE LEAVES BEHIND AND NOT ONLY AS A LEGISLATOR BUT AS A FATHER IN THAT IN A HUSBAND AND A FAMILY MAN AD- CALIBER TO SUPERVISOR AND OBVIOUSLY A STATEMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE IT IS I'M VERY SAD THAT WE- HAVE THIS CONVERSATION TODAY BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HONOR SENATOR BERRY HILL YOU KNOW I MET SENATOR BERRY HILL WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. BECAUSE HE PERSONALLY CAME OVER AND ASKED ME TO PARTICIPATE IN HIS FROG JUMPING CONTEST NEW YORK STREET EVERY YEAR IN I THANK YOU AGAIN WHEN I FIRST CAME INTO THE ASSEMBLY I WAS NOT INTERESTED IN A FROG JUMPING CONTEST BECAUSE WE WERE YOU KNOW TWENTY MILLION TWENTY IT SAYS A SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT IT WAS JUST IT WAS ATROCIOUS WHEN WE FIRST CAME IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN. AND HE SAID COME ON GROVE THIS IS WHERE YOU GUYS CAN GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER AND THAT BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS GO OUT NAME OF FROG AND HOPEFULLY YOUR FRONT WILL WIN AND SO I TOOK HIM UP ON IT AND I JUST APPRECIATE THAT HE HAD THAT ATTITUDE THAT WE CAN ALL HAVE DIFFERENCES IN POLICY WE CAN ALL DISAGREE ON WHAT WE- THINK IS BEST FOR CALIFORNIA- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY SENATOR BERRY HILL WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT RELATIONSHIPS WERE STRONGER THAN THE POLICY DISAGREEMENTS. AND IT SAID IT'S WITH GREAT SADNESS THAT WE STAND HERE TODAY BUT- ALSO REJOICING IN THE FACT THAT I KNEW HE WAS A STRONG BELIEVER IN CHRIST AND THAT HE'S IN HEAVEN AND THAT ALL THE ILLNESSES THAT HE HAVEN'T BEEN COMPLETELY HEALED AND SO LET'S JUST KEEP HIS FAMILY AND HIS WIFE AND IN IN HIS ENTIRE FAMILY IN PRAYER SO. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU SENATOR BREAUX. NEXT UP SO. KNOWS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE. NOT ONLY DID THE BERRY HILL BROTHERS SERVE HERE IN OUR STATE LEGISLATURE BUT THEIR FATHER CLAIRE DID AS WELL. SERVED IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THEN THE LAST FOUR YEARS AS A STATE SENATOR. SO IT'S KIND OF A FAMILY TRADITION CLLR BERRY HILL WAS AS WELL DURING THE DAY BEIJING YEARS THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE OF CALIFORNIA MANIFESTING THAT LONG HISTORY OF THE BURIAL FAMILY BEING INTEGRAL FORCES. IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. AND TOM FACED HUGE CHALLENGE A HEART TRANSPLANT IS A BIG DEAL. WELL AFTER THE TRANSPLANT TOM BERRYHILL DID NOT JUST SIT AROUND AND REST ALL OF THE TIME HE GOT BACK INTO THE ARENA. AND THE LORD BLESSED HIM WITH MANY MORE YEARS YET TO SERVE US. AND SERVE THE PEOPLE THAT HE REPRESENTED IN HIS DISTRICT. THEY DID IT WELL ALL THE WAY THROUGH. SO WE WILL CERTAINLY MISS HIM HE WAS A GREAT ADDITION TO THE INSTITUTION. AND CONTRIBUTED MIGHTILY TO THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. TOM BERRY HILL WILL BE MISSED. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON. NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR BORJAS. MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF. I AM THANKFUL THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BURIAL A MENTOR A FRIEND AND A COLLEAGUE. TOM WAS BORN ON AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH NINETEEN FIFTY THREE IN THE TOWN OF SIRIUS JUST OUTSIDE MODESTO HE ATTENDED SERVICE HIGH SCHOOL MODESTO JUNIOR COLLEGE AND LATER CALIFORNIA POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY IN SAN LUIS OBISPO. THE FORMER IN SMALL BUSINESS OWNER TOM REPRESENT THE TWENTY FIFTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT IN THE EIGHTH SENATE DISTRICT HIS BROTHER BILL WASN'T AS WE'VE HEARD AS WAS ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY IN THE NEIGHBORING TWENTY SIXTH DISTRICT. THE BURIALS WERE THE FIRST BROTHERS EARLY TO SERVE CONCURRENTLY IN THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO DECADES. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW TOM HAD A PASSION FOR WINE AND WAS A FRIEND AND CHAMPION DRIVER CULTURED SMALL BUSINESS. HE WAS ALSO A FRIEND TO MANY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WHERE HE WORKED TIRELESSLY ON BEHALF OF HIS CONSTITUENTS TO GET THINGS DONE. DESPITE A HEART TRANSPLANT IN TWO THOUSAND ONE HE CONTINUED TO SERVE AND FIGHT FOR HIS COMMUNITY. TOM BURIAL LET A DEDICATED LIFE IN SERVICE TO HIS COMMUNITY BOTH IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. AND ON THE STANISLAUS COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. BEFORE YOU EVEN BUY CAMPAIGNING FOR STATE SENATE. TOM TAUGHT ME MANY VALUABLE LESSONS HI HE WAS US HE WAS A MENTOR. HE VALUED RESPECT INCIVILITY. IF YOU HELP ME. RUN TO BEAT HIS SUCCESSOR SO. FOR MANY YEARS WE HAD- REGULAR REGULAR CONTACT WHEN HE WAS THE CENTER FOR- BUT THE TWO TERMS AND THEN OF COURSE HE HELPED ME- AND I'M ACTUALLY IN HIS APARTMENT RIGHT NOW SO WHICH IS WHERE I LIVE. BUT I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT. HOME TOLD ME. YOU'RE GOING TO DISAGREE WITH A LOT OF FOLKS IN SACRAMENTO WHEN YOU BECOME A SENATOR IN FACT YOU'LL PROBABLY DISAGREE WITH YOUR OWN CAUCUS A LOT OF TIMES FOR YOUR JOB. IS GOING TO ALWAYS BE LOOKING FOR THAT COMMON GROUND. WHERE IS THAT COMMON DENOMINATOR IT'S A PLAN THAT. THAT YOU BUILT BECAUSE ISSUES WILL COME AND GO. AND ABOUT YESTERDAY IS SOMETHING IN THE PAST BUT MOVING FORWARD EVERY DAY WHERE IS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR WHERE CAN YOU BUILD AND FIND THAT COMMON GROUND I ACTUALLY THAT'S THAT'S A LESSON ON THAT. I HOLD DEAR AND- AS WE ADJOURN TODAY- I THINK HIS LEGACY IS THAT. HE BROUGHT. RESPECT AND CIVILITY AND COLLEGIALITY INTO OUR ENATE TRADITIONS AND WITH THAT HE WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED OUR HEARTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO LORETTA AND THEIR TWO DAUGHTERS- THEY LIVE IN TWAIN HARTE AND- WE'RE SENDING THEM OUR PRAYERS DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME.

HE HAD A LIGHT IN HIS EYE AND HE AND CAMILLA COULD JUST REALLY SET EACH OTHER OFF SO I WANTED TO GIVE THE LIGHT PERSPECTIVE OF MR BEER HILL HE KNEW HOW TO HAVE FUN TOO IN ADDITION TO HIS FROGS. OUR COLLEAGUE SENATE BILL FIVE FIVE FIVE IS BACK BEFORE YOU FOR CONCURRENCE THE BILL WILL REDUCE THE COSTS OF COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND COMMISSARY ITEMS SOLD IN COUNTY JAILS THAT ARE PAID FOR BY THE INCARCERATED PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES THIS BILL IS INCREDIBLY TIMELY RIGHT NOW WITH SUSPENSION OF VISITATION IN PRISONS AND JAILS TO THE CALL THAT NINETEEN. YOU KNOW IN COUNTY JAILS YOU CAN'T EARN MONEY BY WORKING TO PUT MONEY ON THE BOOKS YOURSELF YOU RELY ON YOUR FAMILY TO BRING MONEY IN AND IF THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO COME IN THAT COMPLICATE YOUR ABILITY TO GET FOOD AND NECESSARY ITEMS FROM THE COMMISSARY. WHEN THE CARS READY PERSON CANNOT VISIT WITH A LAWYER FAMILY MEMBERS AND LOVED ONES AT THE SAME TIME THEY CANNOT WORK TO EARN MONEY WE CANNOT CONDONE FIFTEEN DOLLAR PHONE CALLS FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES OR COMMISSARY ITEMS ARE NOT AFFORDABLE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU ANY DISCUSSION OR ON THIS ITEM I SEE WE HAVE SOME REMOTE MEMBERS. SENATOR GROVER RECOGNIZE IF YOU MR PRESIDENT YOU KNOW WHEN THE AUTHOR FIRST BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD I WAS SUPPORTED ON THE FLOOR IN A COMMITTEE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID MAKES PERFECT SENSE THAT YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE INCARCERATED SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH OUT AND HAVE- DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR ATTORNEY OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BUT SINCE THAT HAS HAPPENED I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY MY LOCAL HERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND- IN ALL THE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT. AND THEY'VE ASSURED ME THAT- THIS WILL TAKE A ROUGHLY ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE KERN COUNTY SHERIFF'S BUDGET WHICH WILL GO AND COME FROM OTHER PROGRAMS OTHER PRGRAMS LIKE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCARCERATED STILL GET THOSE BENEFITS BUT THE- DOLLAR WILL. WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE TECHNICAL DISK. DIFFICULTIES CENTER GROVE IT WAS A MOMENT. OTHER PROGRAMS SO I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY- I CHANGE MY VOTE AND- AND- VOTE NO BECAUSE I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE CUT BECAUSE OF THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NO FUNDING. BUT AGAIN I SUPPORT BE- I SUPPORT THE POSITION YOU KNOW PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE PHONE CALLS BUT IT DEFINITELY HAS TO BE FUNDED OR ELSE OUR COUNTY JAILS ARE GOING TO HAVE. HUGE ISSUES WITH OTHER PROGRAMS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT- IT IF WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND IF WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT RECIDIVISM THERE'S NO BETTER TOOL TO PREVENT RECIDIVISM THAN A CLOSE FAMILY CONNECTION AND THERE'S NO BETTER TOOL TO CONTINUE THAT FAMILY CONNECTION THAN PHONE CALLS IN CHARGING EXORBITANT RATES TO PRECLUDE FOLKS FROM CONNECTING WITH THEIR FAMILIES. IS A PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NO OTHER MICROPHONES SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MAKE CALLS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE SHARED BUT I- BY MY COLLEAGUE- FROM THE VALLEY- BUT LET ME JUST SAY. THE MARKUP ON COMMISSARY ITEMS IN THE CONTRACT THAT THE SHARES HAVE NEGOTIATED FOR CELL PHONE RATES AND- VIDEO CONFERENCING. THEY AREN'T CONTRACT THAT ANY OF US WOULD SIGN FOR OUR OWN PERSONAL USE THE PROFIT MARGIN IS WHAT IS MOST OFFENSIVE- FOR EXAMPLE AND SO SHE TALKED ABOUT THE CONCERN ABOUT THE INMATE WELFARE FUND. THE WAY IT WAS ORIGINALLY SET UP THESE FUNDS WERE SUPPOSED TO GO INTO THE INMATE WELFARE FUND TO PAY FOR THOSE SERVICES. ON THE FUNDS HAVE NOT BEEN USED TO PAY FOR REQUIRED COUNTY. IN MANY INSTANCES THEY HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF GRAND JURY INQUIRE RESULT CROSS THE STATE TOO MANY HERE TO MENTION TOO MANY COUNTING STEPHEN. REFERENCE AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS BASICALLY PLACE THE CAT WE'VE NOT SEEN THE PHONE CALLS ARE FREE BUT THE COMMISSARY ITEMS ARE FREE WE'VE- TRY TO PROVIDE SOME DIRECTION TO THE SHERIFFS AND SOLD THE PROFIT MARGIN. ISN'T SO EXCESSIVE THE KIND OF PROGRAMMING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S WHAT GOVERNMENT BUDGETS ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. WE IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AT THE STATE PRISON LEVEL ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR- TRAINING AND ALL KIND OF THINGS TO AVOID RECIDIVISM SO IT SHOULD BE BALANCED ON THE BACKS. OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO ARE TRYING TO STAY CONNECTED TO THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS- AGAIN IT'S A CAP IT'S NOT ZERO CALLS WE'VE GOT TO TAKE THE PROFIT OUT OF THIS THESE CONTRACTS AND. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I ASK FOR NOVEL. THANK YOU. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON ITEM TWELVE SP. FIVE FIVE FIVE. ALAN FIVE ARCHULETA I AT KINS. WELL HI BRADFORD I HAVE A ZERO I DON.

MOVING ON NOW MEMBERS FILE ITEM FIFTEEN BY SENATOR JACKSON ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THAT ITEM MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE RATE. SENATE BILL NINE SEVENTY THREE BY SENATOR JACKSON AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT INTERJECTION GOOD MORNING MR PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES SP NINE SEVENTY THREE IS BACK ON CONCURRENCE THIS IS A BILL THAT FIGHTS GENDER AND RACE BASED PAY DISPARITIES. WITH DATA AND REQUIRES LARGE COMPANIES TO SUBMIT REPORTS ANNUALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION AND HOURS WORKED OF ITS EPLOYEES BY GENDER RACE ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY RECENT AMENDMENTS REQUESTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING OUTLINED SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NEEDED BY COMPANIES. AND RELATED TO COMPANIES- THE TWO COMPANY ADDRESSES EXCUSE ME THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THEIR WORK AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOT VOTE ON AMENDMENTS ON CONCURRENCE. IS DESCRIPTION- VERY WE'RE RECOGNIZING SENATOR GIRL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND YOU KNOW I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL I SPOKE AGAINST IT WHEN IT LEFT OUR FLOOR. AND NOW WITH THE KOBE SITUATION IT EVEN SEEMS MORE DETRIMENTAL AND NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD ON BUSINESSES BECAUSE OF- THE KOBE SITUATION THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN- ADAPTING TO REVOKE IT WORKING REMOTELY. BUT MY MAIN OBJECTION IS THAT AS AN EMPLOYER AND IN THE REAL WORLD I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY- AS AN EMPLOYER IT'S ILLEGAL FOR US TO ASK FOR THIS INFORMATION YOU CAN'T AS FOR IT ON AN APPLICATION. YOU CANNOT- ASKED FOR THE INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED- AT YOU CAN MAKE ASSUMPTIONS BUT SUPPOSE YOU MAKE THE WRONG EXTENSION A REPORT THE WRONG DATA. THERE IS- IT'S ILLEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR US AS EMPLOYERS TO ASK ETHNICITY QUESTIONS- GENDER QUESTIONS ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING REQUESTED FOR US TO GATHER INFORMATION ON. AND THEN SUBMIT TO DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING OR DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT IS ILLEGAL FOR US TO DO THIS WE CAN'T GARNER THAT INFORMATION SO. A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. SYNERGY WOULD YOU TAKE QUESTIONS CERTAINLY. IN RIVER SO COULD YOU PROVIDE I MEAN YOU ARE AN ATTORNEY AND COULD YOU PROVIDE ANY ADVICE TO EMPLOYERS ON HOW THEY WOULD OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION. OUT BASED ON THE BILL- BECAUSE IT IS ILLEGAL FOR US TO OBTAIN OR ASK THOSE QUESTIONS WHEN WE INTERVIEW. OR IN PLACE SOMEBODY IT'S ALL VOLUNTARY. THERE'S I BEG YOUR PARDON. PROVIDING THE INFORMATION IS ALL VOLUNTARY. I UNDERSTAND IT'S ALL VOLUNTARY ACCORDING TO THE BILL BUT WE AS EMPLOYERS UNDER THIS BILL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT OR DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. HOW DO WE OBTAIN THE INFORMATION WHAT IF THE EMPLOYEES DON'T PROVIDE IT WE CAN ONLY ASK FOR IT SO THEY ARE THEY GOING TO PROVIDE IT ON THEIR OWN. YOU WANT ME TO RESPOND I'M SORRY WOULD HAVE A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THIS- REMOTE THING HERE. IT THIS IS ALL AND TERRY THE BILL DOES NOT CALL UPON ANYBODY TO VIOLATE ANY LAWS. I CAN I JUST ASK IF YOU WOULD THROUGH THE CHAIR TO CLARIFY THE QUESTION IT'S VOLUNTARY FOR THE EMPLOYERS TO PARTICIPATE OR VOLUNTARY FOR THE EMPLOYEES IDENTIFIED THE INFORMATION IS VOLUNTARY FOR THE EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION IF YOU NOTE IN EVERY INSTANCE WHERE. THERE IS A BREAKDOWN IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND GENDER AND ETHNICITY THERE'S ALWAYS A CATEGORY CALLED OTHER. WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE NOT TO HAVE TO DO SO THAT MAKES IT A VOLUNTARY PROCESS FOR THE EMPLOYEE. SO I GUESS- MINE- ADDED A QUESTION THAT I THINK THAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO ADDRESS IN YOUR CLOTHES AND I DON'T NEED TO HAVE- CONTINUOUS BACK AND FORTH BUT IF YOU WOULD ADDRESS IN YOUR CLOTHES. AGAIN IT'S ILLEGAL FOR THE EMPLOYERS TO ASK FOR THIS INFORMATION SO HOW DO YOU ASK FOR THE INFORMATION TO HAVE THE EMPLOYEES EITHER VOLUNTARILY. ADD NOT COMPLIED OR- COMPLY IF THEY CHOOSE TO. BECAUSE WE AS EMPLOYERS CANNOT ASK ANYBODY ABOUT ANY OF THE SUBJECT MATTERS THAT ARE IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL. SO I WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS I DON'T. HEARING SEEN NINE SENATOR JACKSON YOU MAY CLOSE VERY BRIEFLY WHAT'S DETRIMENTAL IS THE FACT THAT THE DISCRIMINATION THAT TAKES PLACE AGAINST PEOPLE BASED UPON THEIR GENDER OR THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN THEIR ETHNICITY HAS CREATED A SCHISM THAT. MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT PAID EQUALLY FOR COMPARABLE WORK WE PASS THAT LEGISLATION IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. IT IS NOW THE LAW OF CALIFORNIA THAT PEOPLE ARE TO BE PAID EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN OR THEIR GENDER BUT BASED ON THE QUALITY OF THEIR WORK THIS IS A MEASURE OF THE PAY DATA BILL WHICH- BASICALLY EXPANDS THE EEO ONE- FORM THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES. TO ALSO INCLUDE CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYMENT OR COMPENSATION SO THAT COMPANIES CAN TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE IN FACT A DISCRIMINATING OFTEN INADVERTENTLY- BUT TO CERTAINLY- BY PUTTING PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN IN LOWER PAYING CATEGORIES- SO THAT THEY CAN CORRECT THEMSELVES WHEN IT COMES TO HIRING. RETENTION AND PROMOTION OF EMPLOYEES THIS HAS BEEN THE PROCESS HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES AND WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT- THAT EMPLOYEES WILL CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE T IS REALLY THEIR RIGHT TO DO SO OR NOT. AND THIS BILL SIMPLY ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS IN HOPES THE COMPANIES WILL COMPLY VOLUNTARILY WHICH IS THE FIRST STEP OF THIS BILL AND IF NOT THAT THE D. F. E. AGE CAN POINT OUT TO THEM THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW. ND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU.

AND WE'RE NOW BACK ON CONCURRENCE HERE IN THE- IN THE SENTENCE I'M VERY PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE WE BASICALLY ALLOWED OIL REFINERIES AND TERMINALS TO USE THE PHONE FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF STORAGE TANKS AND FUEL INDEPTH BUYERS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT WE THEN PUT IN A WAIVER PROCESS THAT GOES OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY TWO FOR OIL REFINERIES AND TERMINALS THAT BASICALLY MEANS THAT THE FIRE MARSHAL HAS TO COME IN AND CERTIFY THAT THERE IS NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE- TYPIFIES IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE USING THE P. FAST. AND WE PROVIDED A THREE YEAR DELAY FOR PEOPLE'S PHONE PHASE OUT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE ALSO PROVIDED AIRPORTS WITH SOME ADDITIONAL ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR FOR TRANITION TIME SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID WE ARE WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE REACHED THIS DEAL THAT WILL HELP TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF FIREFIGHTERS BOTH WHY THEY FIGHT FIRES IN AS THEY FIGHT THE POTENTIAL OF GETTING CANCER OR OTHER TYPES OF DANGEROUS A DANGEROUS AILMENTS DUE TO THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY.

SENATE BILL TWELVE FIFTY SEVEN BY SENATOR DORADO AND AFTER LEADING TO EMPLOYMENT. CENTER FOR GEORGE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS S. B. TWELVE FIFTY SEVEN WOULD ELIMINATE THE EXCLUSION OF PRIVATELY PAID HOUSEHOLD DOMESTIC SERVICE EMPLOYEES FROM CALIFORNIA'S OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT CAL OSHA. ASSEMBLY AMENDMENTS NARROW TO BUILD TO PRIVATELY PAID DOMESTIC WORKERS AND ALSO DELAYS IMPLEMENTATION FOR TWO YEARS TO ALLOW CAL OSHA. TO CREATE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF VEHICLE PARTS EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES TO ADDRESS WHAT AND IF. INDUSTRY SPECIFIC REGULATORY GUIDANCE IS NEEDED ASSEMBLY AMENDMENTS ALSO CLARIFIED THAT ANY INVESTIGATION OF A VIOLATION OF THESE PROTECTIONS MUST BE CONDUCTED IN A MANNER THAT AVOIDS AN UNWARRANTED INVASION OF PERSONAL PRIVACY. THE MEASURE HAS NO ORGANIZATION OPPOSITION AND RECEIVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY. BUT NOW MORE THAN EVER THE HEALTH THESE DOMESTIC WORKERS DEPENDS ON- THE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I WILL. GREAT ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE I'M RECOGNIZING SENATOR GIRL AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I AM GLAD THAT THE AUTHOR TOOK AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS THAT WOULD BE VIOLATED UNDER THIS PARTICULAR BILL- AND I BUT I DO TAKE- OBJECTION TO THE FACT THAT- WHEN SHE SAYS NO OPPOSITION IS REGISTERED BY ORGANIZATIONS. IT'S BECAUSE ORGANIZATIONS WERE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THIS BILL SO BASICALLY EMPLOYEES THAT WERE I. HSS REGIONAL CENTERS THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE PEOPLE ARE PAID BY THE GOVERNMENT TO GO INTO PRIVATE HOMES THEY WOULD NOT BE UNDER THIS REGULATORY PROCESS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO. AND IT HERE TO THIS BUT IF YOU'RE A PRIVATE BUSINESS IF YOUR PRIVATE HOMEOWNER AND YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT COMES IN AND CLEAN YOUR HOUSE EVERY TWO WEEKS OR WHATEVER THAT MAY BE OR COMES IN AND TAKES CARE OF YOUR ELDERLY FAMILY BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING FOR THAT PERSON TO COME AND THEN YOU WOULD BE SUBJECT AS AN INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER. SHOULD THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION SO I GUESS WHEN YOU MAKE SPEECHES OR FLOOR SPEECHES ARE YOU SAYING YOU NEED THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S TO PROTECT ALL OF THESE WORKERS THEN WHY IS IT NOT TO PROTECT ALL WORKERS IN JEST- THE ONES THAT ARE BASICALLY NOT UNIONIZED OR THAT HAVE AT AT. THAT OR NOT THEY'RE IN INDIVIDUAL HOMES SO- I DO STILL TAKE OBJECTION TO THIS BILL I DO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR AT LEAST AT AT MINIMUM SIXTEEN THE FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS WHICH VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION IS THE BILL WENT OFF THE SENATE FLOOR IT WAS AMENDED IN THE S. IN THIS SIMPLY SO I DO I THANK GOD FOR THAT. BUT WE STILL HAVE A HUGE ISSUE THAT- IF THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES IT'S NOT PROTECTING EMPLOYEES IT'S NOT PROTECTING ALL EMPLOYEES AND IT IS STILL AN INVASION INTO- AN INDIVIDUAL'S PRIVATE HOME. AND SO I WOULD STILL. ABSOLUTELY REQUESTED NO VOTE. THANK YOU FURTHER THE- DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. EARN SCENE NINE SENATOR RAZA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

GENERALLY PREPARED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL TEN EIGHTY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ AND ACTUALLY DID A SOLID WASTE. SENATOR ALAN THANK YOU SO MUCH MEMBERS- MISTER PRESIDENT YOU CALL THESE ARE THIS IS A COMPANION BILLS SB FIFTY FOUR THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR OUT OF THE SENATE AND WHEN WE PASSED IT THERE I MADE A STRONG COMMITMENT TO ALL OF YOU. THAT WE WOULD WORK TO YOU WELL ADDRESS THE VARIOUS CONCERNS THE REAL CONCERNS OF STAKEHOLDERS HAD ABOUT OUR BILL AT THAT SEEKS TO ADDRESS AN ENORMOUS CRISIS BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND FINANCIAL. DOT RELATING TO PLASTIC WASTE I TOOK THAT COMMITMENT EXTRAORDINARILY SERVICE SERIOUSLY I WORK WE WORKED TIRELESSLY SINCE JUNE LAST JUNE TO SOLVE EVERY ISSUE THAT WAS SOLVABLE. HAVING COUNTLESS CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION. HI THIS BILL- IMPRINT KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS IDENTICAL TO SB FIFTY FOUR REFLECTS ALL THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE BASED ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED FROM SO MANY OF YOU AND FROM OUR COLLEAGUES OVER THE SOMEBODY. SOME HERE SOME HIGH LEVEL CHANGES THAT WE'VE MADE WE'VE NARROWED THE BILLS ONLY TO COVER PLASTIC YOU'LL REMEMBER LAST YEAR ALL MATERIAL TYPES WERE COVERED INCLUDING GLASS AND ALUMINUM. WE PUSH BACK COMPLIANCE DATES FOR PRODUCERS BY TWO YEARS FROM TWENTY THIRTY TO TWENTY THIRTY TWO AND AT LENGTH IN SOME OF THE TIME LINES FOR POWER CYCLES ACTIONS. WE HEARD FROM ALL OF YOU LOUD AND CLEAR THAT WE NEEDED TO REDUCE CALORIES CYCLES ROLLS AND WORKLOAD AND SO WE GOT RID OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN NOW WE HAVE CAL RECYCLE CONDUCT OUTREACH TO DEVELOP GUIDANCE TO HELP PRODUCERS COMPLY. TO A ROBUST REGULATORY PROCESS THAT ENGAGES BUSINESS AND PRODUCERS THE BILL GIVES MORE STATUTORY GUIDANCE TO REDUCE THE DEPARTMENT'S DISCRETION AND OFFER PRODUCERS CERTAINTY PARTICULARLY ON REPORTING AND DATA REQUIREMENTS AND COMPLIANCE OPTIONS. RECENT EVENTS ALS CLARIFIED THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHEATING THE TARGETS IN THE BILL FALLS TO THE PRODUCER. ARE THEY WILL BE THE ONES TO DETERMINE HOW TO BEST COMPLY WITH NECESSARY OVERSIGHT ENFORCEMENT TO PREVENT ANYONE FROM GAMING THE SYSTEM BUT ULTIMATELY PUTTING THEM IN THE DECISION MAKING. DRIVER SEAT. NOW LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE WORK WE DO MISTAKE. THIS PAST YEAR WE TOOK HIM FOR THE EXAM FARMERS THAT TACK YEAH THAT PACKAGE ON THEIR FARM. ODD THAT THESE GUYS ARE CONSUMERS OF THE PACKAGING THEY'RE NOT THE PRODUCERS SO WE EXEMPTED THEM. WE TELL. OUR CYCLE TO CONSIDER FOOD WASTE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE RAISED BY OUR FRIENDS IN WESTERN GROWERS- THAT WAS A AN ACT ASPIN THE BAG LETTUCE AND CARROT FOLKS. LIKE OUR CYCLES DASH TO BE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM DOESN'T CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL FOOD AND AGRICULTURE MINTS AND WE ADDED TO FOOD PACKAGING REPRESENTATIVE ADVISORY PANEL. WE ALSO ADDED A CLAUSE EXEMPTING SMALL PACKAGING COMPONENTS SUCH AS COURTS AND TAPES- TAPE AND LABELS. AND CONVERT THE MINIMUS. ISSUE ASSOCIATED. WITH WINE ESPECIALLY. THE ROLE THE RETAILERS AND WHOLESALERS HAS ALSO BEEN CLARIFIED IN THE BILL WE GIVE THEM CERTAINTY TO AVOID BEING. PULLED INTO THE PROGRAM ALTOGETHER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES FOR EXAMPLE WE STATUTORILY EXEMPT RETAILERS AND WHOLESALERS. MAKING LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WE LOWER THE PENALTIES FOR SMALLER PRODUCERS YOU FALL OUT OF COMPLIANCE. ON COMPLIANCE FOR PRODUCERS NOT MEETING THE RATES BEYOND THE FLEXIBILITY THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO ADJUST THE RATES IN CASE OF AN UNFORESEEN MARKET ISSUE LIKE CODE FOR EXAMPLE. WE ALSO ALLOW PRODUCERS TO AVOID PENALTIES BY DEVELOPING A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN THAT LAYS. OUT HOW THEY'LL COME INTO COMPLIANCE. THE NEW AMENDMENTS MAKE THAT PRODUCERS ARE. KERR ACTION DON'T ACCRUE PENALTIES THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING. THAT WE DISCUSSED IN OUR CONVERSATION WITH BUSINESS OUR GOAL HERE IS NOT TO BE PUNITIVE. BUT TO GET COMPLIANCE IT'S TO PRODUCE PUSH PRODUCERS TO GET TO THE RECYCLING RATES. STAKEHOLDERS ALSO WANT TO SEE GREATER PARTICIPATION ON ADVISORY PANEL WE ADDED SEVERAL SEATS TO ENSURE THE RECYCLERS AND- COMPOSTERS WERE REPRESENTED ALONG WITH THE NEW FOOD. PACKAGING FOLKS WE HAD A C. TO ENSURE THAT A FINAL JUSTICE GROUPS WERE INVOLVED. AND NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION THE BILL INCLUDES STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR PRODUCERS CHOOSING TO FORM A STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION WE LEARNED A LOT FROM OUR MATTRESS IN OUR BATTERIES PROGRAMS AND- ALL THE CHALLENGES THATTHEY'VE GOT. AND WE DESIGNED OUR OPTION HERE SPECIFICALLY TO AVOID PREVIOUS PITFALLS THE BILL ALSO MAKES CLEAR THAT NO ENTITY CAN BE REQUIRED. TO JOIN A STORAGE OF ORGANIZATION IS ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY ACTS. BY THE PRODUCER. WE ALSO HAD A LANGUAGE CAREFULLY BALANCING THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE HAULERS WITH THOSE OF THE PRODUCERS TO ENSURE THE FRANCHISE CONTRACTS ARE PROTECTED. WHILE PRODUCERS PARTICULARLY THOSE FORMING STORAGE OF ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY. TO REACH THE RATES. SO THERE THERE I'M HAPPY TO GET INTO MORE DETAILS- BUT I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THIS IS SOMETHING THE PUBLIC IS ASKING FOR- YOU KNOW THE POLLS. OVER AND OVER AGAIN THROUGHOUT OUR STATE SHOW THAT PEOPLE WANT US TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE CHALLENGE HERE ULTIMATELY IS FALLING ON OUR TAXPAYERS ARE REPAIRS IN OUR CITY COUNCILS I JUST HAD A CHAT WITH ONE OF MY LOCAL CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO WAS SHOCKED. BY THE RATES THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT TO HER BY THE WASTE MANAGEMENT FOLKS- BECAUSE HOW HIGH THOSE RATES ARE ABOUT TO BE JACK. THERE'S BOTTOMS FALLING ON THE RECYCLING MARKET- AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS REINVIGORATE THAT MARKET. AND THE HOPE HERE IS THE PLAN HERE IS IN THE END WE HAVE A KIND OF ECONOMIC STUDIES IS TO SEEK TO SHOW THIS. THE DAY AFTER THIS BILL PASSES THERE WILL BE AN INFUSION OF INVESTMENT. INTO THE SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL BE NECESSARY TO MEET THE GOALS OF THIS STUFF. RECYCLING AND SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING MANUFACTURING. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. ON THE FLOOR SHEENA CINCINNATI METRO I'M SORRY. MY SISTER PRESIDENT JUST A QUICK QUESTION OF THE- JACKIE PUT THE FLOOR MANAGER PLEASE ENTER ONLY TO QUESTION YES SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT SUMMARY OF THE WORK THAT YOU ALL DID OVER THE YEAR IT WAS A BUSY YEAR YOU TALKED ABOUT- THE EXEMPTION OF. ARMED GROUPS UNDER A MILLION DOLLARS I WONDER IF THAT INCLUDED RESTAURANTS BECAUSE I'M JUST HEARING I'VE MY OFFICE HAS BEEN FLOODED BY. VERTICALLY NOW POST COLD RESTAURANTS IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE HAVE BEEN A POLL FOR THIS BILL AND SOMEONE IN IT THAT EXEMPTION IF- BUSINESSES UNDER A MILLION A YEAR WOULD APPLY TO THEM. WELL IT'S FOR THE RETAILERS AND WHOLESALERS I WILL SAY THAT- INTO THE FUTURE SINCE THE SEASON. ON EITHER END OF THE DAY DATE THE THEY'RE NOT THE RESTAURANTS ARE THE PRODUCERS RIGHT THEY'RE NOT PRODUCERS SELLING. SO WHEN THIS BILL GETS THROUGH. THERE WILL BE NEW PRODUCTS ONLINE FOR THEM TO PURCHASE. THAT WILL BE COMPLIANT WITH THIS BILL. SO I KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE STRUGGLING INTERNALLY THIS IS GOT TO BE FULLY LIMIT IS NOT IMPLEMENTED TWENTY THIRTY TWO LONG AFTER COVET. SO I KNOW THEY'RE NERVOUS I UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM. BUT THIS IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT. THERE WILL BE A WHOLE NEW SET OF PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE COMPLIANT THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE AND CAN USE IT AND I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE PRODUCTS EVERYTHING AFFORDABLE BECAUSE GIVEN THE FINANCIAL. STRAINS THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING THAT. IT WILL PUT ADDED BURDEN TO THEM. ABSOLUTELY AND YES ABSOLUTELY. THE ALL I PUT ON THAT SO TO LOOK AT WHAT WE DID WHEN WE PUT IN PLACE RULES. THAT INCREASE THE- THAT THE POLLUTION. REQUIREMENTS ON OUR CARS BECAUSE YOU KNOW KIDS IN LA WERE GROWN UP WITH HALF OF THE LUNG CAPACITY. THE KIDS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF ALL THE SMOG. YEAH PEOPLE SAID WELL THIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE CAR'S NOT GONNA AFFORDABLE KNOWN TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE ANYMORE. WE PUT THE RULES IN. BUSINESS STEPPED UP THE MARKET WORKS. AND NOW WE HAVE MUCH CLEANER BURNING CARS WE GOT DOUBLE THAT OUR PEOPLE IN LA A LOT MORE TRAFFIC BUT MUCH CLEANER AIR. AND SO THE MARKET WORKS IN THE MEDIA THAT WE KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY THERE WE KNOW WE KNOW THE INFRASTRUCTURES THERE WE NEED INVESTMENT IN THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THAT'S HOW. YOU END UP DRIVING DOWN PRICES AND MAKING IT WORK FOR EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU- MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I STAND AS A PROD CO AUTHOR OF THE- IDENTICAL BILL AND I DO WANT TO THANK ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR WORKING SO HARD AND I WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED OUR SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES. YOU WILL DEFINATELY RAISE THE RESTAURANTS CONCERTS- BUT OUR- THE JOCKEY MENTIONED THE COST OF TO THE WASTE HAULERS. AND OF COURSE OUR RESTAURANTS ALL OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS OUR INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTS PAY FOR THEIR GARBAGE AND RECYCLING PICK UP. AND BECAUSE OF THE COLLAPSE IN THE RECYCLING MARKET THOSE FEES ARE GOING UP SO HIGH THAT ANY POTENTIAL COST INCREASE OF A PRODUCT WOULD FART WILL EASE I MEAN THE- IF THIS BILL AND IT'S DESIGNED TO DO SO. CAN REDUCE THOSE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THE- HOLLER WEST TO PICK UP MATERIALS HASN'T NO WORK NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM AND BASICALLY IT'S JUST PRODUCT THAT CANNOT BE RECYCLED PRODUCT THAT CANNOT. BE DISPOSED OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN A LANDFILL- THEN OUR FEES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO UP THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE MANY OF OUR- WASTE HAULERS- AND THERE ARE THE UNIONS WHO REPRESENT. THE HOLLERS ALL IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL SO WHILE MANY OF US APPROACH THIS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL LANDS MANY MANY OTHERS ARE APPROACHING THIS VERY MUCH FROM THE ECONOMIC LENS BECAUSE WE'RE IN A SITUATION NOW. WHERE WE PROMISED PEOPLE RECYCLING AND YET WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECYCLE THESE PRODUCTS SO WITH THAT IT'S A GOOD BILL AND I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- AND WHAT I THINK THE SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA FOR ALL THE DETAILS RIGHT- WAS LOOKING TRUCK WITH ONE COMMENT AND THAT IS A AN INFUSION OF INVESTMENT WHICH MEANS AUSTIN AND I'M SORT OF CONCERNED WITH OUR KIND OF ME BEING IN SHAPE IT IS ALTHOUGH THERE BEEN DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTATION- I STILL THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL I HAVE AS WE WORK WITH INDUSTRY IN THIS REGARD. CAL RECYCLE CERTAINLY NEEDS A WHOLE NEW BUSINESS PLAN I'M NOT SURE THIS IS IT- BUT- I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR HARD WORK BUT THE LIST OF THOSE THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IS STILL RATHER LENGTHY UNLESS MY COMMENTARY IS OUTDATED SO. I WILL BE A NO VOTE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE ON THE FLOO IT'S SEEN NINE REMOTELY. SENATOR ALAN WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE MEMBERS I DO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME ATTENTION I MY STAFF ACTUALLY CLARIFIED FOR MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES- CENTER MITCH I THEY'VE ACTUALLY WROTE- RESTAURANTS INTO THE DEFINITION OF RETAILERS FOR UNDER A MILLION SO THAT SO THE READ THE SMALL RESTAURANTS ARE ACTUALLY EXEMPTED UNDER THE BILL. SO I WANT TO GET THAT CLARIFIED THEY ARE TAKEN CARE OF I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT IT HAPPENS ON THAT'S FANTASTIC THANK YOU TINA AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE LET'S DO THIS FOR OUR CITIES FOR REPAIRS FOR TAXPAYERS FAR ENVIRONMENT FOR CHILDREN.

AV. THIRTY THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN. SHE S. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL OR MUNISH PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER KALRA AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT. SEVEN ZERO ZERO THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT THIS BILL CREATES A RIGHT OF RECALL AND RETENTION FOR WORKERS EMPLOYED AT LARGE HOTELS AIRPORTS CONVENTION CENTERS AND IN JANITORIAL SERVICES. THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE LAID OFF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS WHO HAVE NO IDEA IF OR WHEN THEY CAN RETURN TO WORK. THE BILL INITIALLY FEATURED ROBUST PAID LEAVE AN EXPANSION OF THE CFRA PROVISIONS BUT IT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY PARED DOWN TO ONE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE. THE RIGHT TO GO BACK TO THE JOB YOU HAD BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. BOOKERS WITH DECADES AT THE SAME BUT WITH THE SAME EMPLOYER WORKED THEIR WAY UP. MAY LOSE THEIR JOBS TO NEWER LOWER PAID WORKERS. THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER SEVERAL ORDINANCES PASSED ALREADY. IN CITIES AND COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE LONG BEACH LOS ANGELES CITY LOS ANGELES COUNTY GLENDALE SANTA MONICA OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO CITY AND AIRPORT SAN JOSE CITY AND AIRPORT JUST TO NAME A FEW. THAT IS THAT WHEN THESE LARGE COMPANIES DO EVENTUALLY WE OPEN THE EMPLOYERS SHOULD EXTEND THE INITIAL OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT BACK TO THE PERSON WHO HAD THE JOB BEFORE THEY WERE LAID OFF. THIS ENSURES THAT OLDER WORKERS WITH YEARS OF SERVICE HAVE A SHOT AT GETTING THEIR JOBS BACK. IT ALSO ALLOW EMPLOYER IT ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO RETURN TO FULL PRODUCTIVITY IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT HAVING TO TRAIN NEW EMPLOYEES SEVERAL AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE INCLUDING THE REMOVAL OF THE RIGHT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THE BILL FACILITATES THE QUICK AND EFFICIENT RE HIRING OF WORKERS WHO LOST THEIR JOBS DUE TO NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. THE GOAL HERE IS FOR THE WORKERS TO GET THE JOB BACK GET BUSINESSES TO RE OPEN AND BE FULLY OPERATIONAL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. PROVIDE RECALL ONLY APPLIES TO WORKERS LAID OFF DUE TO A STATE OF EMERGENCY SUCH. AS THE COLD WITH PANDEMIC. S. I WILL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. THREE NINE SENATOR BREAUX I'M SORRY SINNERS SENATOR RUBIO OVER IN THE CORNER SENATOR RUBIO. I GOT YOU. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND ATHLETE ISN'T IN A MINUTE THE SENATE I JUST WANT TO RISE AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I THINK THIS IS REALLY IPORTANT TIMES OF FIVE EMERGENCIES LIKE NOW THAT SO MANY WORKERS ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS I THINK THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE MEASURE TO GET PEOPLE BACK ON THEIR FEET ESPECIALLY OUR OLDER CALIFORNIANS WHO WHO NEED TO GO BACK TO WORK SO I STRONGLY URGE AND I BOTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SENATOR GIRL. I THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I- I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO GET WORKERS BACK TO WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT AND THAT THEIR BUSINESS OR THE JOB THAT THEY HAD WAS SHUT DOWN AND IT DEFINITELY WASN'T THE BUSINESS OWNER. OR THE- THE PROPRIETOR OF THAT BUSINESS. IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT THAT- THEY'VE LOST ALL THIS REVENUE AND HAD TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS. I DO HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR REGARDING THE SALE AND TRANSFER OF BUSINESSES IF SHE WOULD TAKE A QUESTION. THROUGH THE RISERS MANAGER WE TOOK A QUESTION. AND I'LL RESPOND AT THE END SHE SHE WILL QUESTION INTERVALS THANK YOU OKAY WELL I DO HOPE YOU DO RESPOND BECAUSE IT IS A QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED SO FOR INSTANCE LET'S USE A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE WE ALL GOT NOTIFICATION OR YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN NOTIFICATION THAT AMBROSIA A VERY WELL KNOWN AND WELL LIKED AND CAFE IS CLOSING ITS DOORS FOR GOOD. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WITH ALL THE REQUIREMENTS- IT HAD TO BE MET IN ORDER TO SURVIVE IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. SO THOSE EMPLOYEES I WILL NOT HAVE A JOB TO GO BACK TO YOU AND TO THE CURRENT OWNER EVAN BROSIUS. IF AMBROSIA OPENS AT AM AND OUR NEW OWNERSHIP MY QUESTION IS THAT WITH THE NEW OWNER REQUIRE BE REQUIRED TO HIRE THE EMPLOYEES THAT WERE LET GO FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER OF THAT BUSINESS- SO THAT WOULD APPLY TO ALL BUSINESSES STATEWIDE AND I WOULD JUST LIKE A RESPONSE ON THAT. ON MY OWN TIME AGAIN I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT- THERE IS AN EXEMPTION THERE IS AN EXEMPTION THAT REQUIRES THE STILL- THAT THAT IS IN THIS BILL FOR EXISTING UNION CONTRACTS- DEALING WITH RETENTION AND SO I GUESS MY BIG BEEF WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT. I'M NOT ONLY DO I THINK IT'S VERY. ON BUSY IS JUST WITH A TRANSFERS. IF THAT'S THE CASE AND BUT IT IS ALSO EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO SUPPORT A BILL THAT. YOU SAY THAT YOU WANT TO PROTECT WORKERS BUT WE DON'T SERVE PROTECT THOSE UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND AGAIN AS I MENTIONED A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO IN MY COMMENTS. SEVERAL OF THESE FARM PACKING HOUSES THAT ARE UNDER UNION AGREEMENT WITH THE U. S. W. HAVE LOST. AND YOU KNOW SEVERAL PEOPLE TO FATALITIES. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT- OR THEY CAN'T GET THE CONTRACT- INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN CHARGE OF THE CONTRACT TO BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SAFETY OR DO ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE THAT ARE RESTRICTIVE ON ANOTHER EMPLOYER THAT WOULD HAVE TO BEABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE THINGS. BECAUSE EVERY EMPLOYER WANTS TO MAKE SURE THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE SAFE. BUT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO CONTRACT TO PROVE WHEN THINGS FIRST. SO GOING BACK TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL. I GUESS I HAVE A HUGE CONCERN THAT IT DOESN'T COVER ALL EMPLOYEES. BUT MOSTLY I NEED SOME ANSWERS ON THE- THE TRANSFER OR SALE OF THE BUSINESS WOULD THAT BE A REQUIREMENT FOR THE NEW OWNER TO BRING BACK THE EMPLOYEES UNDER THE PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP. IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND- THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON YOU'RE FINE. THANK YOU MOVING ON TO SENATOR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR BRING TO THE TIME PERIOD IT'S OUTLINED IN THIS BILL- THIS. IS IN PLACE FOR A DETERRENT FOR THE EXTENT OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY BUT WE HAVE. SEVERAL STATE EMERGENCIES IN FACT SEVENTY ACCORDING TO MY NOTES ON THAT WERE ONGOING SO SAVE EMERGENCY CAN GO ON FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. AMONG DECEMBER TWENTY THIRD JUST OF LAST YEAR GOVERNOR NEESON TERMINATED MORE THAN SEVENTY ONGOING STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT HAD BEEN DECLARED AT VARIOUS TIMES IF SOMEONE IS DATED BACK TO THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. SO IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THIS BILL IS LIMITED TO JUST THE STATE OF EMERGENCY RELATING TO KIND OF ADD ON MEGAN WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE GOVERNOR WILL DECLARE AN END TO THIS DATA THAT EMERGENCY. SO I THINK WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES IF THIS GOES ON FOR YEARS LIKE SOME OF THE STATE OR MERGING TEAMS HAVE GONE. ON TO I WONDER IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT PLEASE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL- DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. HEARING C. NINE SENATOR RAZA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES AGAIN THE GOAL OF THIS IS FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN GO BACK TO THEIR JOB THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL FACT THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HERE- IF THERE IS A NEW EMPLOYER THAT EMPLOYER WILL ALSO HAVE TO HIRE THOSE WORKERS BACK. FOR AT LEAST NINETY DAYS AND THEN BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THEM BUT THERE'S NO REASON IF IT CONTINUES TO BE A RESTAURANT WHY THE SUCCESSOR EMPLOYER SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THEM BACK- I'M NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE EMERGENCY OTHER THAN. IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY THAT'S WHEN THE SUPPLIES I'M SORRY DON'T KNOW MORE DETAILS THAN THAT I JUST WANT TO END IF I CAN MR WOULD JUST IF I MAY READ TWO SENTENCES FOR MACHINERY. THANK YOU ON THE LOS ANGELES TIMES WROTE AN ARTICLE THEN IT WAS ABOUT THE SAID SEVEN YEARS AGO A SINGLE MOTHER BACK AND WAS HIRED AT A HOTEL IN BEVERLY HILLS LUXURY HOTEL CATERING TO SAUDI PRINCESSES JAPANESE INDUSTRIALS AND EUROPEAN MODELS. THERE SHE WORKED HER WAY UP FROM A MINIMUM WAGE BED MAKING JOB TO POSITION AS ON- SEVENTEEN DOLLARS. AN HOUR MINI BAR ATTENDANT. LATER SHE PICKED UP HER FINAL CHECK SHE WAS TOLD HER TERMINATIONWAS FINAL AND IF THE HOTEL RECOVERED IN THE FUTURE SHE COULD RE APPLY AS A NEW EMPLOYEE WE WOULD HAVE NO SENIORITY.

ALTHOUGH THESE TACTICS ARE NOT NEW. TO OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD WATCHED AS GEORGE FLOYD. SLOWLY DIED AT THE HANDS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS MESSAGE METHOD ALSO KNOWN AS A SLEEPER HOLD INVOLVES APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE SITES OF THE NECK WITH AN ARMOR KNEE IN THE CASE OF GEORGE FLOYD. IT QUICKLY BLOCKS BLOOD FLOW IN THE CROWD CAROTID ARTERIES AND RENDER SOMEONE UNCONSCIOUS IT CAN CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH IF THE BLOOD FLOW IS RESTRICTED TO LONG. SIMPLY MAINTAINING RESTRICTED BLOOD FLOW FOR ONE MINUTE AFTER THE SUSPECT IS RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS CAN CAUSE PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE. FIFTY THOUSAND SEVENTY THREE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE DIED BY ASPHYXIATION AND BEING RESTRAINED 53% FOR BLACKS AND LATINOS. AFTER A CONVERSATION WITH SEVERAL LAWYERS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE AG WE WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT OFFICERS MAINTAIN THEIR RIGHT TO SELF DEFENSE. THIS IS ABOUT TAKING AWAY A DANGEROUS TECHNIQUE THAT CAN AND HAS EASILY GONE WRONG. THIS BILL HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND SUPPORT FROM GOVERNOR NEWSOM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MEMBERS OF THE BLACK LATINO API WOMEN'S LGBTQ AND JEWISH CARCASSES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ABLE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR NELSON. THIS PRESENT LATER IN JAIL IN THE SENATE I WILL JUST CONTINUE TO ASK FOR A NO VOTE. FOR FORTUNATE THERE ARE CRITICAL MOMENTS THAT I GUESS MOST OF THE PUBLIC ARE NOT AWARE OF. AND WHEN THAT PROGRAM OFFICER NOT THIS BECAUSE OUR KNEE JERK BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE TRAINED THOROUGHLY TRYING. PLUS THEY HAVE DEVELOPED GOOD INSTINCTS OUT ON THE LINE IN THE COURSE OF THEIR CAREER. AND WHEN THEY AND THEIR LIFE OR A THREAT. THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND. FULLY WITH THE BEST RESOURCE IS AVAILABLE. AND NOT ONLY TO THEIR OWN WELL BEING. BUT ALSO QUITE OFTEN TO THE CITIZENS AROUND. SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS. BUSH TOO FAR. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THESE TERRIBLE INCIDENCES WHICH INCIDENT THAT BECAME SO HIGH PROFILE. ARE COMMONPLACE DEGREE JUST BEHAVIOR. THE PERPETRATOR WILL PAY A PRICE I'M QUITE SURE AND OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE FIND COMFORT IN THAT JUSTICE WILL BE DONE. THE TECH ABOUT YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WHO DAY AFTER DAY. BUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. AND THOSE CRITICAL SECONDS. THE RIVER BETWEEN THEM. IN DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. THEY ARE TRAINED TO RESPOND AND I WILL ARGUE. THEY ARE VERY RESPONSIBLE. AND THEY ARE SAVING OUR LIVES IN OUR PROPERTY. AND WE NEED TO PUT. HANDCUFFS ON THE CRIMINALS NOT ON OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS. SENATOR PAT. HE WAS A FRESHMAN SENATORS ISAH STAND IN SUPPORT OF- THE SPELL I KNOW THE- FLOOR MANAGER HAS SPOKEN TO SOME OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF CHOKEHOLDS AND CROWDED. PRESSURE AS WELL AND AS A PHYSICIAN I JUST WANT TO STAND AND SAY. THAT THESE ARE HIGHLY DANGEROUS MANEUVERS AND WHILE I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE MY GOOD FRIEND FROM TAYLOR TALKING ABOUT HOW SKILLED OFFICERS ARE WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE RISKS SO WHATEVER THE INTENTIONS OF THE OFFICER. THEY ARE ENGAGED IN A WITH THESE MANEUVERS AND SOMETHING THAT CAN LEAD TO. THE PERMANENT INJURY OR DEATH OF THE PERSON THEY ARE TRYING TO RESTRAIN. AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE GIVEN HOW DANGEROUS THESE ARE THAT WE BAN THIS TYPE OF- RESTRAINT AND THAT THIS CERTAINLY I ARE HIGHLY SKILLED OFFICERS WOULD- TODAY FIND ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF- TRYING TO. PROTECT THEMSELVES AS WELL BUT- I THINK THIS IS WAY TOO DANGEROUS AND I ASKED FOR AN ITEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT- I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY- HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IT WASN'T JUST ONE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED TO BE THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT THAT WENT VIRAL THAT. EVERYONE SAW BUT IN CALIFORNIA HOW MANY HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY THREE PEOPLE KILLED BY THIS FIXATION. WE HAVE NO IDEA THOSE PEOPLE WERE CRIMINALS ARE NOT THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAPPEN TO HAVE AN ENCOUNTER WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE ENCOUNTERS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHO ARE LET GO NOT ARRESTED OR FOUND NOT GUILTY WE WON'T KNOW ABOUT THOSE SEVENTY THREE BECAUSE THEY'RE DEAD. MY COLLEAGUE SAID YOU KNOW LET'S NOT PUT THE HANDCUFFS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT IS PUT ON THE CRIMINALS WE'RE NOT QUITE THIS BUILDING QUESTION HANDCUFFS. THIS BILL QUESTIONS A- TITULAR HOLD AROUND SOMEONE'S NECK. THAT OUR POSITION ON THE FLOOR AND MANY OTHERS HAVE SAID. ARE INAPPROPRIATE AND UNSAFE. AND A NUMBER OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE ALREADY BANNEDTHEM SAN FRANCISCO SANTA CRUZ WATSONVILLE OCEANSIDE CORONADO SAN DIEGO LONG BEACH SACRAMENTO. AND MANY MANY OTHERS. WOLONG FORSMAN STILL HAVE MATH METHODS IN USE AND TOOLS THAT CAN YOU USE TO- CONTROL A POTENTIAL ASSAILANT YES THEY STILL HAVE PEPPER SPRAY TASERS AND OTHER WAYS OF TAKING SOMEONE DOWN AND DE ESCALATE SITUATIONS WITHOUT USING FORCE. WE DON'T BELIEVE THE PASSES A BABY ELEVEN NINETY SIX INAPPROPRIATELY HAMPERS TRAINED SKILLED LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM DOING THEIR JOB. JUST DON'T CHOKE ME TO DEATH I'LL BE SUPPORTING MAYBE ELEVEN NINETY SIX. THANK YOU SENATOR- ICE WE HAVE SENATOR BARGES REMOTELY. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- IF I MAY- MERRY POSE A QUESTION TO THE FLOOR MANAGER. SENATOR RAZA WOULD YOU ACCEPT QUESTIONS. I'LL TRY AND I'LL DO IT AT THE END SHE WILL ADDRESS IT IN OUR IN OUR CLOTHES WELL IT'S A IT'S A FACTUAL QUESTION WHICH. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS A DISTINCTION OR IS THERE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN. THE PROHIBITION ON CHOKEHOLDS. WHEN IT COMES TO SUBDUING ASPECTS OF DOING A SUBJECT. VERSUS SELF DEFENSE. IS I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE BED UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES- PUBLIC POLICY COULD VERY WELL BE PUT FORWARD- THAT DISALLOWS OF CHOKEHOLDS WINDY IN A SUBJECT IS SUBDUED. BUT TO DISALLOW. IT WHEN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS LIFE IS IN DANGER IN HERE SHE IS DEFENDING THEMSELVES I THINK WOULD BE. OF A STRETCH AND WE SHOULD NOT. ALLOW FOR A PROBATION TO BE APPLIED IN A SELF DEFENSE CONTACTS SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADDRESS THAT SPECIFIC DISTINCTION TELL ME WHETHER NOT THAT EXIST IN YOUR CLOTHES I'D APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SHINO MIKE SUCKS YOU KNOW HAND REMOTELY SENATOR RATHER YOU MAKE CALLS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID EARLIER LAW ENFORCEMENT STILL HAS OTHER OPTIONS.

THIS ISSUE OF HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND THAT WE ALL KNOW IN OUR DISTRICTS- AS WEARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS FOR FAMILIES TO PUT MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS EIGHTY YOU EFFORT THAT HAS BEEN IN THIS LEGISLATURE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND LED BY. VERY IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE- IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE LAW TO ALLOW EIGHTY USUALLY COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE THIRTY SIX THIRTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RODRIGUEZ AN ACT RELATING TO WORKPLACE SAFETY CENTER FOR GEORGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR THE- THIS IS ALSO PART OF OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY PACKAGE IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES. THIS MEASURE REQUIRES HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE AN INSURER EMPLOYEES USE THEIR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT OR AS WE CALL IT PP THERE'S NO DOUBT AS WE ALL KNOW. THAT WE HAVE HEARD STORIES FROM OUR OWN COMMUNITIES REPRESENT ABOUT SHOCKING LACK OF PP SUPPLIES IN LOCAL HOSPITALS THIS BILL. REQUIRES THESE EMPLOYEES TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYERS EXCUSE ME TO MAINTAIN MISTER PRESIDENT A THREE MONTH STOCKPILE OF NEW AN INVENTORY TO CAL OSHA UPON REQUEST- THIS IS FOR THE FRONT HELPING FRONTLINE WORKERS. THAT HAVE JUST FACED EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES ASPIRIN I VOTE. THANK YOU SEEN ON HAND HERE IN THE CHAMBER. SENIOR HANDS REMOTELY MADAM SECRETARY WELL HERE WE GO WE HAVE. ZERO SENATOR GIRLS AROUND ROOM. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I HAVE A QUESTION THE AUTHOR. WITH THE ORDER TAKER QUESTION CERTAINLY THE NUMBER OF KOREA THANK YOU AND SO BASICALLY WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATION THAT SPECIFIES A VIOLATION OF NOT HAVING TO STOCKPILE MANDATE- WHICH- BECAUSE A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS CIVIL PENALTY- DURING THIS CODE RAMP THAT. I KNOW THAT A LOT OF HOSPITALS- NOT JUST IN MY DISTRICT BUT ALL OVER WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY EVEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE GOVERNOR COULD NOT SECURE MASK- AND- WITH A BILLION DOLLAR DEAL THAT FELL THROUGH. AS COMPETING AS A NATION STATE AS HE SAID AGAINST OTHER STATES AND OTHER NATIONS TRYING TO SECURE THESE ITEMS SO I GUESS IF THE PRODUCT INFORMATION THE PRODUCT THAT FOR THE P. P. IS NOT AVAILABLE I'M IN THE MARKET PLACE. AND YOU'RE GONNA PINA BELIEVE PUNISH HOSPITALS AND OTHER FRONTLINE ORGANIZATIONS FOR NOT HAVING- NOT HAVING THIS P. P. R. HOW HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT GETTING IT IF. IT'S NOT AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET. THANK VERY MUCH SENATOR THE YOU GOOD INTENT CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE OF FIVE OF THE MEASURE. AND IF YOU START AT LINE SEVEN AND GO THROUGH LINE TWENTY. WHAT IT SAYS FIRST OF ALL IT'S UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NOT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COURTS HAVE DISCRETION. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE POINT THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY RAISE EXACTLY WHAT'S ADDRESSED HERE IN THE AMENDMENTS. IT INDICATES THAT YOU HAVE FOUGHT FINES UNLESS I'M READING FROM THE MEASURE. THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES THAT THE EMPLOYER COULD NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS TO THE ISSUES BEYOND OUR CONTROL SUCH AS THE PARK AND DEMONSTRATE. THAT EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION HAS BEEN ORDERED FROM THE MANUFACTURER DISTRIBUTOR OR NOT BUT FAILED. OR IT'S BEEN DAMAGED OR STOLEN. OKAY SO BASICALLY IT DOES PROVIDE FOR THAT FLEXIBILITY OF COURSE I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION. THANK YOU. M. I'M MY OWN TIME I STILL AM OPPOSED TO THIS BILL ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S RESPONSE. ON THOSE QUESTIONS- MY GREAT CONCERN IS NUMBER ONE IF THE INFORMATION IS OR IF THE PRODUCT THE. PP PER PERSON PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT IS NOT AVAILABLE. AND I UNDER. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY'VE ALREADY PLACED THE ORDER- BUT EVEN. IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THEM THE BILLION DOLLAR MASS STILL PER SE JUST FOR AN EXAMPLE. WE LOST RESOURCES ON THAT PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE WE HAD TO PUT A DEPOSIT AT FRIENDS AND THERE WERE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAD TO DO. AND ALTHOUGH I THINK THE GOVERNOR DID EVERYTHING HE COULD TO MAKE SURE THE MONEY WAS SECURED USING THE RIGHT ATTORNEYS AND STAFF THERE WAS STILL. REVENUES THAT WERE TAX REVENUES TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS THAT LOST- ON THAT. PARTICULAR BILL. SO IJUST THINK THAT- MANDATING I THINK THAT EVERY EMPLOYER SHOULD DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED IN THIS PANDEMIC TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. PROPER PP TO MAKE SURE OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS ARE TAKING CARE OF. BUT IF YOU NEED TO REALLY PUNISH ONE- FOR NOT SECURING. I BELIEVE IT WAS A THREE MINUTES OF EARTH. AS THREE MONTHS SUPPLY. AND A THREE MONTH SUPPLY. OF I THINK THAT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT THAT WE CAN PUT ON OUR EMPLOYERS AT. THIS TIME BECAUSE LIKE I SAID. IN THE PAN IN THE BEGINNING MANY PEOPLE WERE. FOR THE PPP ITEMS. THE PRICES WERE SKYROCKETING THERE WAS NO CONTROL WE WERE GETTING EVERYTHING OUT OF CHINA. BECAUSE WE'VE DRIVEN ALL MANUFACTURING- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WITH THE HIGH COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A LOT OF THAT MANUFACTURING GOES TO OTHER STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES. PRIMARILY CHINA. AND I JUST THINK THAT TO HAVE US RELY ON CHINA TO PROVIDE IS FOR PP. AT AN ADEQUATE COST AND HAVE OUR EMPLOYERS PUNISHED IF THEY CAN'T SECURE IT. IS NOT GOOD LEGISLATION BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THIS COURSE IS A BIT ON THE SIDE- DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU. THE PRESIDENT- CENTERS- I ACTUALLY STAND AND SUPPORT I APPRECIATE THE- ISSUES BROUGHT UP BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD IN FACT THAT- IN. NOT ONLY WORKING THIS BILL BUT A NOTHER BILL THAT- MYSELF AND- SUR LEYVA. ARE WORKING ON- WE DID TRY TO ADDRESS THIS VERY ISSUE ABOUT NOT HAVING- HEALTHCARE FACILITIES LIKE HOSPITALS HAVING TO STOCKPILE PP DURING A STORAGE PERIOD IT ADDED. I KNOW THAT THERE WERE TALKS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AND- AND ENSURING THAT THAT SITUATION WOULD NOT HAPPEN. BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY. A STUDY FROM UC BERKELEY SHOWS WHAT THE COST. IT WAS IN BOTH MONEY AND LIVES TO CALIFORNIA THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE A LAW LIKE THIS IN PLACE PRIOR TO COPE AT NINETEEN. AND CERTAINLY WE WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE THAT SITUATION GOING TO FEATURE. SO I WOULD ASK THAT WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM.

BRIEFLY THE WORK SHARE PROGRAM IS A FORM OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IT GIVES EMPLOYERS THE OPTION OF REDUCING EMPLOYEES HOURS INSTEAD OF CUTTING THEIR WORKFORCE. DURING AN ECONOMIC. DOWNTURN FOR EXAMPLE A BUSINESS MAY DETERMINE IT NEEDS TO REDUCE PERSONNEL COSTS BY LAYING OFF FIVE EMPLOYEES. UNTIL BUSINESS CONDITIONS IMPROVE UNDER THE WORKSHOP PROGRAM THE EMPLOYER INSTEAD CAN REDUCE THE HOURS OF TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. BY 25% AND THOSE WORKERS RECEIVE A PRO RATA U. I.

WITH ALL THE THIRD QUESTION I WILL DO THAT YOUR SISTER WE ALL KNOW THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT THE YOU I TRUST FUND IS COMPLETELY UNDERFUNDED AND- THE LAST TIME THAT THIS HAPPENED EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE WHERE WERE ADDITIONALLY CAPPED AT. A TAX FOR THE TAX REDUCTION CREDIT- NOW WE HAVE THE PLAYERS IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION WHEN IT WASN'T THERE REESE IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT THAT- THE ECONOMIC SHUTDOWN TO PLACES WAS DIRECTED FROM THE GOVERNOR. SO THESE BUSINESSES THAT ARE OPERATING AT DIMINISHED CAPACITY OR MINIMAL CAPACITY AND- IT'S MORE THAN LIKELY THAT THEY WILL- THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO TAKE ON THE BURDEN AND THE AND THE UNINSURED AND EMPLOYMENT. TRUST TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THIS MONEY IS PAID OUT. AND REFUNDED AND THAT WILL HAPPEN FOR. I'M ASSUMING TEN TO TWELVE YEARS IN THE FUTURE SO I GUESS MY AND MY QUESTION IS THAT THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS TAKEN. IN THE ASSEMBLY WHICH ELIMINATED- YEAH THE ELIMINATED THE ABILITY TO- AD DOLLARS INTO THE U. I. TRIES TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE STRAIN IT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING ON FUTURE. IN THE FUTURE ON ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HE TELL ME WHY THAT A MINIMALISTIC SEPT. IT AND WHY WE WOULD EVEN TRY TO. BIRD BUSINESS THAT ARE EMPLOYERS ANYMORE THAN THEY ALREADY ARE. HAPPY TO. BE CHALLENGED AT ALL OF US FACED IN THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN HERE WAS TO TRY TO REDUCE AS MUCH BURDEN AS POSSIBLE ON THE GENERAL FUND. THE FRAMEWORK WAS HOW DO WE KEEP PEOPLE WORKING CREATE THE MOST AMOUNT OF ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR FOLKS. THE MONEY YOU TALK ABOUT IS A IT IS AT THIS POINT A NO INTEREST LOAN. BUT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S LIKE A LINE OF CREDIT. SO HERE WE ARE HAVING THE BENEFIT OF THESE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OF COURSE IT WILL ULTIMATELY BE A BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS BUT IT'S A NO INTEREST LOAN THAT BASICALLY TAKES CARE OF PEOPLE ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BUY FOOD PAY THE RENT AND THE LIKE. SO BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE WHEN THE SITUATION THAT IS QUITE CHALLENGING THAT YOU'RE CORRECT IS NO ONE'S FAULT. WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IN WHAT WHY I THINK THIS MEASURE SO ELEGANT IT'S BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND. ARM WE CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP PUTTING A HUGE BURDEN ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S GENERAL FUND THAT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC. WE HAVE A NO INTEREST LOAN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME NOW FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN ALSO WE HAVE THIS ODD SITUATION WITH THIS WORK SHARE PROGRAM WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO WORK IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYER YOU WILL BE GOT A REALLY GOOD EMPLOYEE YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST BE A SITUATION ARE INCENTIVIZED TO GO ON AN EMPLOYMENT. AND THIS MEETS A REALLY ELEGANT BALANCE IN THAT REGARD GIVEN ALL OF THESE VERY SERIOUS CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING IN THE ECONOMY GOING FORWARD. AND WE DON'T KNOW FOR THE BEGINNING MIDDLE OR END OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE SO. IT IS CHALLENGING BUT IT IS AND IT WILL HAVE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE THERE'S NO QUESTION THEY'LL BE CHALLENGES AS WE GO FORWARD. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TO KEEP FOOD ON THE TABLE KEEP KIND PLAYERS- HAVING- THEIR EMPLOYEES WORKING AND HAVING THEIR BENEFITS SO I THINK IT'S. A PRETTY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH BY THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE I WOULD ADAM ACTUALLY URGE A NO VOTE FOR THE PREVIOUS REASONS I THINK THAT- I DO AGREE THAT IT'S LIKE A NO INTEREST LOAN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED WHEN WE HAD AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEFAULTED ON THAT ON LOAN AND NEVER PAID A DIME- BACK FROM THE GENERAL FUND- SO THE- EMPLOYERS WERE TAXED. AT A GREATER AMOUNT AND IF THE TAX REDUCTION CREDIT WHICH WAS ELIMINATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FAILED TO PAY THAT LOAN BACK. SO IT'S STILL ON THE BACKS OF EVERY JOB CREATOR. AS SOME BUSINESSES WENT OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY BURDEN. AT TO MAINTAIN I BELIEVE FOR SIX YEARS AND- WE DID ESTIMATE TO SHOW THAT THIS WILL PROBABLY LAST LONGER TAN FIFTEEN YEARS. I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY GATHER SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE- IT IS. SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO OFFER IT TO SEE IF OTHER EMPLOYEES WOULD BE WILLING TO. YOU KNOW SHARE THE BURDEN OF SOMEBODY LOSING THEIR JOB. I'M SO I SEE THE IMPACT THAT I JUST DON'T SEE. THAT YOU CAN- DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND NOT ADDRESS THE SEVERE. GET THIS SEVERE- REJECTION IN THAT YOU I TRUST FUND. BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT. SHORTFALL THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE MADE AT. AT SO AGAIN I WOULD AS ABSOLUTELY ASK FREE AND NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MELINDA. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT RIGHT. YOU KNOW GET THE IDEA BEHIND THIS BILL I LAKE THE PROBLEM IS IT THE APPROVAL OF THESE PLANS- GO TO THE DIRECTOR B. D. D. AND WE KNOW THAT EDIE D. HAS HAD A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS KEEPING UP WITH THEIR WORKLOAD RECENTLY TO THE POINT WHERE THE MOST RECENT ARTICLE I SAW SAID THAT EDT WISE NOT ANSWERING 60% OF THE CALLS THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING. SO I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT JUST THEM BEING ABLE TO TAKE ON MORE TASKS- I WONDER IF THE AUTHOR OR THE FLOOR MANAGER COULD- ADDRESS THAT PLEASE. I'LL JUST MY CLOTHES. HE WILL ADDRESS IT IN CLOSER- MELINDA'S. ZERO DOLLARS. THANK YOU THE BUT MR PRESIDENT THAT REAL QUICK I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THOSE EMPLOYERS THAT ACTUALLY. ADD TO PAY BACK IN THE UNDER THE LAST RECESSION WE HAD AND IT WAS IT WAS FROM THE TWO THOUSAND A RECESSION. THAT WE'VE ALL THE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST LIKE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- THE JOCKEY THIS BILL AND YOU KNOW THOSE EMPLOYERS HAD TO PAY THAT BACK WE JUST GOT IT PAID OFF- I THINK IT WAS LIKE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. OR SEVENTEEN AND NOW HERE WE ARE AGAIN GOING RIGHT BACK TO THE SAME PROCESS I LIKE THIS BILL A LOT I ACTUALLY WANT TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL AND IT WAS. IN GOOD SHAPE UNTIL IT CAME BACK WITH THE- PUTTING THEM AREN'T OWNERS ON BUSINESSES. ARE ALREADY. STRUGGLING UNDER THIS CODE. IS SHUT DOWN OUR BUSINESSES ARE FAILING OUR OUR CLIENTELE IS GONE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS THAT IS MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT IF YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS YOU HAVE NO EMPLOYEES. WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE NO JOB. THE IDEA OF DOING A PARTIAL IS GREAT BUT WHEN IT GOES BACK ON TO THE EMPLOYER- I CAN'T SUPPORT THAT AND- IT'S- JUST AMAZING TO ME THAT WE CAN NEVER. LOOK OUT FOR THE BUSINESS OWNER THAT ACTUALLY SUPPLIES THE JOB AS PRIVATE INDUSTRY JOBS. THE GREAT THE TAX DOLLARS FOR THE GENERAL FUND WE'RE WE'RE SECRETLY TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF SO. FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL. DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE SIDE OF. HERE IN CHINO IN SOONER TO REGAIN MAY CLOSE THEM VERY BRIEFLY I YOU KNOW I THINK THE AUTHOR IS SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. THIS GOVERNMENT TO GET IT CORRECT TAKE TEN YEARS ROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO PAY OFF THE LAST SUM OF MONEY. I THINK THAT I THINK THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY GOING FORWARD AND CERTAINLY HAS US IN THE LEGISLATURE TO PRIORITIZE WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR SMALL BUSINESSES. TO BE ABLE TO MAYBE HAVE THE STATE STEP UP OR THERE COULD BE SOME OTHER ADAPTIVE APPROACHES BUT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY REMAINS VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE. WE DON'T WANT TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO SAY OH I'M GOING TO JUST STAND ON UNEMPLOYMENT IT HELPS BOTH THE EMPLOYEE IT HELPS FOR BENEFITS AND HELPS EMPLOYERS TO KEEP THEIR PEOPLE IT'S SMART. I AGREE THAT THERE MIGHT BE CHALLENGED IN THE FUTURE. WE ARE IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION THIS SOLVES THAT ISSUE IN THE NEAR TERM. AND WE LEAVE OPEN FOR DEBATE GOING FORWARD IF WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME SUBSIDY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND IMPACT THOSE QUESTIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. TO ANALYZE WHAT RESOURCES THE STATES HAVE WHAT PRIORITY THE STATE HAS SO IT'S IMPORTANT POINT BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW THIS IS PART OF A VERY URGENT SITUATION AND IT'S A VERY WELL THOUGHT THROUGH BILL LAST YEAR I BOUGHT.

GONE UP DRASTICALLY IT IMPACTED MANY MANY FAMILIES BUT ALSO CHILD ABUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- ALL OF THESE HORRIFIC AFTER- AFTER SHOCKS I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY- THE- AFFECTION THAT ARE AFFECTED BY TOBIN IN THE LOCKDOWN AND I WOULD HOPE THAT- AS THIS NEW INFORMATION COMES OUT WITH CDC GUIDELINE OR CDC THAT IS SAYING THAT YOU KNOW THE FATALITY RATE IS OERSTATED BASICALLY BECAUSE- PEOPLE THAT DIED WITH CO MOBILITIES AND DIED- WITH KELVIN VERSES FROM KOBE THAT REPORT JUST CAME OUT TODAY I WOULD HOPE THAT THE FATALITY RATE WOULD BE ADJUSTED AND WE WOULD TAKE A MORE REASONABLE APPROACH. ABOUT HANDLING AND THIS PARTICULAR VIRUS A MOVING FORWARD AND AS WE- AS WE- SENT THE FATALITY RATE THAT THIS THIS VIRUS IS ACTUALLY CAUSED BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ON THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND THE AFOREMENTIONED THINGS THAT DEPRESSION WITH OUR CHILDREN AND WANTING TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUICIDE- LIKE THIS STILL WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE ADDRESS.

BUT YOU KNOW WE HAD A PLAN FARMERS DON'T PLANT SEEDS IN THE- WRONG TIME OF YEAR THEY PLAN- SO THEY CAN HARVEST A MINUTE RIGHT TIME. I THINK WHAT THE FOCUS NEEDS TO BE IS NOT SO MUCH ON. YOU KNOW. THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WHERE ARE WE GOING. WHAT WHAT IS THE OUTCOME WHAT ARE WE DOING TO CURB THESE MASSIVE FIRES OTHER THAN. TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW BATTERIES N. AND WE HAVE ROLLING BLACKOUTS BECAUSE WE FOCUSED ON. THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOINGTO. CLOSE DOWN NATURAL GAS PLANTS. IN IT YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THE AND THE- WORK IT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THE GROUND IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD FOCUS ON. AND I THINK THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN JUST MISGUIDED FOR TWENTY YEARS OF WHERE WERE THE PRIORITY. IS TO SPEND THE MONEY AND WHICH IS THE BIGGEST. OUTPUT OF CARBON. FOREST FIRE NUMBER ONE BY FAR WORSE EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT NO WE KEEP CONTINUE TO. PUT MONEY INTO TRAINS WE KEEP CONTINUE TO PUT MONEY INTO. SOLAR WHICH WHICH WE HAVE TOO MUCH OF IT AT THE ROCK WRONG TIMES A DAY. I THINK WE JUST NEED TO DO SOME PLANNING SOME SERIOUS LIKE HEY WHAT IS IT WHAT IS THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER KALRA AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT. SENATOR THEMSELVES FLANDERS THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIVE EIGHT EIGHT ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER KALRA. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT WILL PROHIBIT HEALTHCARE EMPLOYERS FROM CONTINUING THE UNETHICAL PRACTICE OF MAKING JOB APPLICANTS PAY FOR EMPLOYER MANDATED TRAINING WITH THAT TRAINING IS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO DO THEIR JOB. LAW ALREADY PROHIBITS EMPLOYERS FROM MAKING EMPLOYEES PAY FOR COSTS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE EMPLOYEE TO DO THEIR JOB. THIS IS THE SAME TYPE OF MANDATED TRAINING THAT AN EMPLOYER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR AN EMPLOYEE BUT BECAUSE OUR JOB APPLICANTS AND NOT EMPLOYEES THESE ARE JOB APPLICANTS AND EMPLOYEES THESE EMPLOYERS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS LOOPHOLE. HOLDING WORKERS AND JOB APPLICANTS FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR EMPLOYER REQUIRED TRAININGS TO EMPLOYMENT. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT SIMPLY CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW TO ENSURE EMPLOYER MANDATED TRAININGS AND PROGRAMS ARE COVERED. BY THE EMPLOYER AND EXTEND THE SAME PROTECTIONS TO DIRECT PATIENT CARE JOB APPLICANTS. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NIGHT OUT. THANK YOU IN ADDITION DISCUSSION. ON THE SIDE OF THE FLOOR SENIOR MICROPHONES. WE HAVE CENTER GROVE REMOTELY. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL EMPLOYER MANDATED TRAININGS ARE MANDATED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU THINK EMPLOYERS WANT TO IMPOSE ALL OF THESE RIDICULOUS TRAININGS AND RIDICULOUS- SCHEDULE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE TO OUR EMPLOYEES- WE DON'T TRUST ME I DON'T KNOW ANY EMPLOYER THAT DOESN'T THAT THAT AND I DON'T KNOW ANY EMPLOYER THAT DOESN'T AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT. WE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE EMPLOYER MANDATED TRAINING AND- NOW PAY FOR EXTENDED LICENSE SEEN EXTENDED- SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN ELECTRICIAN AND I REALIZE THAT THIS JUST HAS TO IT HAS TO DO WITH HOSPITALS BUT YOU PAY FOR THE ADDITIONAL LICENSING WHEN THEY'RE ONLY AN APPLICANT. SO THIS PERSON CAN STILL APPLY YOU'RE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THAT LICENSE YOU DIDN'T THEY DON'T TAKE THE JOB THAT YOU OFFERED THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE SO TO REQUIRE AN EMPLOYER TO PAY FOR A LICENSE WHEN THE EMPLOYEE IS ONLY THE EMPLOYEES NOT EMPLOYEE IT'S AN AFRICAN THERE AN APPLICANT. SO FIFTY APPLICANTS COME TO APPLY AND FIFTY LICENSES HAVE TO BE ACQUIRED BY THE EMPLOYER AND PAID FOR BY THE EMPLOYER BEFORE A JOB OFFER IS EVEN MADE OR ACCEPTED- I THINK THIS IS JUST ANOTHER- BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS- WHEN THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF HIRING AN EMPLOYEE WITH A LICENSETHAT THEY PAID FOR. AD BECAUSE AN OFFER HASN'T EVEN BEEN MADE AND THE EMPLOYEE HASN'T EVEN ACCEPTED. IT'S POTENTIALLY JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE AN APPLE KIDS FOR A BUSY. ON MY WRIST ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK ANY IDEA DISK AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARK STONE AN ACT RELATING TO MOBILE HOMES. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR GEORGE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT AT TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE- AS YOU KNOW MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POSITION PARTICULARLY DURING THE CALL THE CRISIS- AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO REQUIRES PARK MANAGEMENT TO GIVE HOMEOWNERS AT LEAST SIXTY DAYS CURRENTLY FIFTEEN DAYS IS THE SPORT STANDARD. WRITTEN NOTICE THAT MANAGEMENT WILL BE APPEARING BEFORE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD COMMISSIONER BODY TO ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN LOCAL APPROVAL FOR INTENDED CHANGE OF USE OF THE MOBILE HOME PARK. THIS BILL CLARIFIES THE POWER OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO PROTECT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY REQUIRING A FINDING OF APPROVAL NOR TO CONVERT PARKS THE CONTAIN LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE MOBILE HOMES- THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDES THAT SHOULD BE- PARK BE CONVERTED THAT THE RESIDENTS OF THE PARK WOULD BE. ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION. ABC TWENTY SEVENTY TWO WOULD ALSO RESTORE THE POWER OF LOCALS TO ENACT LOCAL RENT STABILIZATION ORDINANCES FOR RESIDENTS IN OTHER WORDS. IT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS AND THOSE THAT LIVE IN STICK BUILT HOUSING- I URGE YOUR BIBLE. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS OR DEBATES GOING ON ON THE FLOOR SENATOR GIRL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL YOU KNOW A PERSONAL STORY WE WERE IN AT CURRENT COUNTY. WIN IN KERN COUNTY- WE HAVE A MOBILE HOME PARK THAT WAS- TAKING OVER AS AN OPPORTUNITY ZONE BASICALLY TYPE ENVIRONMENT TO AN ENTERPRISE ZONE OR AT A PLACE WHERE NEW INVESTORS WOULD COME AND INVEST IN THIS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE THERE INCLUDING ALL THE CHILDREN- PREDOMINATELY THAT THE MOBILE HOME PARK WAS- THAT TRADERS WERE OCCUPIED BY INDIVIDUALS THAT- DID NOT- DESIRE THAT TO HAPPEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY. BREAKING THE LAW STEALING AND SPLITTING- P. JEANNIE WIRES SO- THEY HAD SPLICED THAT P. G. NEAR THE POWER WIRES TO THE POINT WHERE THREE OR FOUR HOUSES WERE OPERATING ON ONE PARTICULAR- UNIT. THEY HAD- DAMAGED- SO MUCH OF THAT THE MOBILE HOME PARK- PUT THE PART OF THE POOL WAS FULL OF DEBRIS- IT WAS JUST HORRIFIC AND EVERY TIME THE OWNER TRIED TO GO IN AND CLEAN IT UP HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO DO SO AND IT OR IT WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO IT WAS SAID JUST A CONSIDERED A RE DONE. THEY WOULD STILL ATTACKED THE PARK AND- BECAUSE- DAMAGE TO THE PARK AGAIN SO THEY ARE FINALLY GAVE UP SOLD IT TO THE NEW GUYS COME IN THINKING THEY COULD CLEAN IT UP AND THEY RAN INTO THE SAME PROBLEMS AND IT MADE IT UNSAFE FOR ALL THE CHILDREN THEIR CHILDREN OR POINT PLANE AND DEBRIS PILES. AND SO TO RESTRICT PEOPLE'S ABILITY AND I'M NOT SAYING EVERY MOBILE HOME PARK IS LIKE THIS AT ALL IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM BUT TO RESTRICT AN OWNER'S ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE CHANGES AND- AND IN A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP AND ALSO- YOU KNOW HAVING TO GIVE THIS NOTICE REQUIREMENT. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THE STRUGGLES OF HIS OWNERSHIP HAD CONTACTED MY OFFICE THAT WE TRIED TO WORK THROUGH- WITH ED THE MOBILE HOME PARK OF ORGANIZATION- TO FIX AND IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE SO MONTHS AND MONTHS HAD GONE BY BEFORE ANY TRANSITION COULD. BE DONE WITH THIS PARTICULAR MOBILE HOME SO I THINK WE SHOULD. NOW IS JUST. A AND YOU PASS THIS BILL IS JUST TO. WAY RESTRICT PEOPLE FROM MAKING A BETTER CLIMATE FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE LOW- SOCIO ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE. OF PARENTS THAT HAVE CHILDREN THAT ARE IN THESE VERSES IN THESE LOCAL HOME PARKS AND THE ELDERLY AS WELL. SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING INSANE NINE SENATOR UMBERG WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- YES THANK YOU- I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT THAT IT LEADS TO MORE MOBILE HOME PARK THERE'S SOME FOLKS WHO ARE A LAW ABIDING CITIZENS BUT OVERWHELMINGLY THOSE WHO DO LIVE IN MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE SENIORS AND THEY ARE LAW ABIDING- THIS BILL DOESN'T. RESTRICT IN OWNERS ABILITY TO CONVERT THE PARK IT SIMPLY GIVES THE RESIDENTS MORE TIME TO- ONE DEAL WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY IN TERMS OF THE CONVERSION INTO S. I THINK MOST OF US KNOW MOBILE HOMES ARE NOT REALLY MOBILE HOMES THEIR HOMES THAT ARE MANUFACTURED THAT ARE. THAT ARE OWNED ON A RENTAL SPACE YOU CAN'T REALLY MOVE THEM AND SO THEY'RE IN A UNIQUE POSITION AND DO REQUIRE MORE TIME. ORIGINAL VOTE. GREAT MMHM SURGERY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN.

CENTERED IN DOLLARS WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY FIVE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAY. WHICH WILL PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND CONSTITUENTS BY LOWERING EXPOSURE TO COVERT NINETEEN IN THE WORKPLACE CURRENTLY THERE IS NO COMPREHENSIVE MANDATE TO PUBLICLY REPORT CODE NINETEEN EXPOSURES IN CASES FOR TRACKING PURPOSES. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES EMPLOYERS REPORT FATALITIES AND SERIOUS INCIDENTS IN THE WORKPLACE BUT ONLY RECOMMENDS THAT EMPLOYERS REPORT INSTANCES OF COVER NINETEEN INFECTIONS. SIX EIGHTY FIVE WILL ESTABLISH CLEAR AND SIMPLE GUIDELINES FOR WHAT AN EMPLOYER SHOULD DO WHEN THEY ARE INFORMED THAT SOMEONE AT THE WORK SITE HAS TESTED POSITIVE OR BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH COPD NINETEEN. THE MEASURE WILL ALLOW EMPLOYERS ONE BUSINESS DAY TO NOTIFY WORKERS WHO ARE ON THE PREMISES WITH THE PERSON WHO TESTED POSITIVE AND WILL REQUIRE THE NOTICE TO INCLUDE INFORMATION ON WHAT TYPE OF SICK LEAVE THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR AND THE DISINFECTION PLANNED. FOR THE SITE. AT SIX EIGHTY FIVE ADDITIONALLY REQUIRES IT OF THREE WORKERS TEST POSITIVE WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS WHICH IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEFINITION OF AN OUTBREAK. THE EMPLOYER MUST REPORT THIS TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THESE COMMON SENSE REQUIREMENTS ARE THE EXTENT OF THE EMPLOYER'S OBLIGATIONS. INCLUDING THE AUTHOR HAS ASKED ME TO SHARE THAT SHE HAS MET. AND NEGOTIATED IN GOOD FAITH WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS FOR THAT AND- THE BILL HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED TO SIMPLIFY NOTICE REQUIREMENTS. REMOVE DUPLICATIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS REMOVE THE PENALTY REMOVED REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. EXEMPT MOST HEALTH CARE EMPLOYERS AND ADD IT TO YOUR SUNSET. AND SHE IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS IN JANUARY AND HAS COMMITTED TO WRITING A LETTER IN THE JOURNAL FOR FURTHER CLARITY- FOR ALL THIS AND ENSURING THAT WE PROTECT OUR- ESSENTIAL WORKFORCE IN THIS VERY.% CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BILLS. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR CENTER DRAWS A. SENATOR ROGER MARKS NOT ON YOU KNOW HELLO OKAY YEAH AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF A. B. SIX EIGHTY FIVE. IT'S A PRIORITY BECAUSE CORBIN NINETEEN AFFECTIONS AND DEATHS HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED THE LATINO COMMUNITY IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE ACT SWIFTLY TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE WORKERS. AND MINIMIZE. CORBETT NINETY NOW BREAKS BY REQUIRING ACCURATE AND TIMELY COVERED NINETEEN EXPOSURE DATA. AS REPORTED BY EMPLOYERS THIS INFORMATION CAN SURE ABLE TO FULLY REOPEN OUR ECONOMY WEALTH SAFELY FOR MINIMIZING CARBON NINETEEN FACTION AND TRANSMISSION RISKS ASPIRIN I WILL. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR PEROT. SO THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- HIGH RISE IN OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY FIVE THIS CRISIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY A BROUGHT ABOUT NEW CHALLENGES AND HURDLES THAT WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME BUT REACTIONS TO THE CRISIS LIKE THIS HAVE TO BE- WELL THOUGHT OUT AND NOT YOUR RATIONAL IN THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL THE BILL IS AN ATTACK ON OUR PLAYERS AND OUR JOB CREATORS MAKES COMPLIANCE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. WITH THE BROAD AND VAGUE LANGUAGE IT'S NOT ONLY SO POORLY THOUGHT OUT BUT POORLY WRITTEN AND IT HAS HEAVY PENALTIES FOR BUSINESSES AT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IF IT IF IT EVEN THOUGH IT FAILS TO CLEARLY NOT OUTLINED WHAT IT KIND OF CUTS TO USE AND EXPOSURE ADDITIONALLY IT IMPOSES RIDICULOUS AND BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS ON EMPLOYERS WE HAVE TO REPORT CODE EXPOSURES ON THEIR EMPLOYEES IN THEIR OWN HOME- I DON'T KNOW HOW AN EMPLOYER WOULD COMPLY WITH THAT IF EMPLOYEE GOT COATED IN THEIR OWN HOME OR OUTSIDE OF THE WORKPLACE. AND THE EMPLOYEE DIDN'T SELF IDENTIFY YOURSELF EXPOSE THAT HOW WOULD THE EMPLOYER HAD THE ABILITY TO EVEN- MAKE THAT A REPORTING I MEAN HOW CAN YOU MAKE IT REPORTED A FIRE BUT WHEN THE EMPLOYEE ISN'T EVEN REQUIRED SIMPLY TO THAT REPORTED TO THE EMPLOYER THE BILL PROVIDES THE CALIFORNIA DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH OSHA WITH YOUR STORY TO WALK INTO A BUSINESS IS BUSINESS AND BASICALLY JUST SHUT THEM DOWN- WITHOUT ANY DUE PROCESS AND THAT'S COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. DOZENS OF ASSOCIATIONS ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE AND FOR GOOD REASON I ACTUALLY CONSIDER THE SEVERE RAMIFICATIONS A STILL HAVE- INUSE YOUR LOGIC INTO DENYING THIS PREMATURE BILL AGAIN- I DON'T KNOW HOW ANY EMPLOYER IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND REPORT AN EMPLOYEE GETTING INFECTED IN THEIR OWN HOME OR IN THEIR OWN FAMILY GATHERING OR OUTSIDE THE SCOPE F EMPLOYMENT I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER THIS. OR DEBATE ON THIS. WE HAVE. SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT APPEAR TO ADDRESS IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE EMPLOYEES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DISCLOSE. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE WAY THAT I UNDERSTAND IT. THE ENTIRE ONUS IS ON THE BUSINESS OWNER BUT THAT BUSINESS OWNER DOES NOT HAVE FULL ACCESS. TO INFORMATION IN THE EMPLOYEE HOUSEHOLD IN FRANKLIN I IMAGINE THERE'S SOME PRIVACY EFFORTS. AND PROTECTIONS IN PLACE THAT MAY ACTUALLY KEEP THE EMPLOYEE FROM HAVING TO DISCLOSE. SO THAT'S ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS THAT THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY TAILORED AND REFINED. INTO A WORKABLE FORM THE SECOND IS THAT IT IS AN AUTHORIZATION UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. BUT THE ENTIRE FOCUS OF THE LEGISLATION IS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CODE. WE DON'T KNOW IF KOBE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE THE THREAT IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE AS IT IS TODAY. SO I WOLD THINK THAT AT LEAST IT WOULD BE REFINED TO THE STATES DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY WHICH IN THE SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATIONS INVOLVING KOBE. SO I GUESS IN SHORT. I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT BUSINESSES OPERATE FAIRLY AND RESPONSIBLY. AND I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN EMPLOYEES- DISCLOSE INFORMATION GOD THAT IS IN THE PUBLIC'S WELFARE IN INTEREST BUT THE WAY THIS IS DRAFTED THERE ARE SO MANY. OF AREAS WHERE. FACT AND CIRCUMSTANCE AND LAWFUL THROUGH THE CRACKS I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS CAN BE SUPPORTED IN I THINK THE INTENT IS GOOD. BUT THIS WOULD DO MUCH BETTER IF THIS WERE BROUGHT BACK. IN JANUARY IN REFINED FURTHER I THINK WOULD BE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE IT WOULD PROBABLY MEET WITH OUR- SIGNIFICANT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BUT INSTEAD ITS CURRENT FORM IT'S JUST NOT DRAFTED WELL ENOUGH IN MY OPINION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MELINDA S. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MY COLLEAGUES FROM FRESNO AND BAKERSFIELD COVERED MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT I WAS GOING TO RACE I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE ASK FOR MANAGER QUESTION IF I MAY. SOONER THAN THOSE WHICH MAKES UP THE QUESTION ABSOLUTELY THE CHAIR SENATOR MELINDA THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT RIGHT JUST I KNOW THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN IN ORDER TO SATISFY SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. SO WERE- ANY OF THE GROUPS INDIVIDUAL AS OPPOSED TO THE ORIGINAL FORM OF THE BILL HAVE ANY OF THEM COME OFF OF OPPOSITION. I'M THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HAS GONE OFF SPECIFICALLY BUT I CAN SAY THAT THE AMENDMENTS- FROM THE ORIGINAL BILL. REMOVED A PENALTY SO THERE'S NO NO NO PENALTY THERE'S NO PRESUMPTION OF RETALIATION- HEALTH FACILITIES EXEMPTED FROM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- NOTICE ONLY GOES TO WORKERS WHO WERE AT THE SAME WORKSITE- NO LONGER INCLUDES- INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING QUARANTINE THERE'S A NUMBER IN. AND ALSO INCLUDES A TWO YEAR SUNSET WHICH I THINK IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT FROM WHERE THE BILL WAS ORIGINALLY. OKAY AND THANK YOU FOR THAT I JUST WONDER IF THAT WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE MANY CONCERNS THAT THE OPPOSITION HAD- THERE WERE A NUMBER OF GROUPS AROUND WERE IN OPPOSITION SO I. I JUST- IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHETHER NOT DISSATISFIED THERE'S BEEN CONCERNS IF. BY SOME CHANCE SOMEONE CAN SLIT THE THAT INFORMATION MAYBE SOMEONE ON YOUR STOCK LET YOU KNOW IF ANY OPPOSITION HAD. PULLED THEIR OPPOSITION BEFORE YOU CLOSE. ON THE BILL THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS REMEMBERS. HEARING SHE NINE SYRIANS ALL THOSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES AGAIN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO ARE OFTEN AND IN WORK PLACES THAT- HAPPEN THAT HAVE- PROVIDED. EXPOSURE EXPOSURE AND THEY ALSO NEED TO KNOW AND HAVE NEED INFORMATION WITHIN THE WORKPLACE. AND THERE IS PRECEDENT THERE'S AN EXAMPLE IN LA COUNTY WERE EMPLOYEE EMPLOYERS ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING THAT DATA TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH. DEPARTMENT AND IT'S PROVIDING GOOD INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS CRISIS SO. FOR THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT BUT- THANK YOU.

ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON AN ACT RELATING TO COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE. THANK YOU SENATOR WARNER I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT A SUMMARY BILL FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIBSON'S AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR WILL I. SIXTY INCREASE ACCESS TO EMERGENCY CARE RESOURCES BY AUTHORIZING COMMUNITY AND TRIAGE PARAMEDIC SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS A CONTINUATION OF PREVIOUS EFFORTS. YES EFFORTS TO ENSURE COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE AN OLD% ALTERNATE DESTINATION PILOT PROGRAMS ARE ABLE TO BE IMPLEMENTED STATEWIDE- AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A HEALTH CARE CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA- THIS CRISIS IS EVIDENT WHEN PEOPLE CALL NINE ONE ONE SEEKING HELP. AND THEY ARE INSTEAD SENT TO AN OVERCROWDED EMERGENCY ROOM- WHERE THEY DON'T ALWAYS RECEIVE THE PROMPT CARE THAT THEY NEED. MANY NINE ONE ONE CALLERS AREN'T ABLE TO RECEIVE TIMELY CARE BECAUSE OUR PARAMEDICS CANNOT TRANSPORT THEM TO ALTERNATIVE DESTINATIONS. SUCH AS A MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC OR A SOBERING CENTER. INSTEAD THEY'RE FORCED TO TAKE THEM TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE ALLOWS SPECIALLY TRAINED PARAMEDICS TO PERFORM OUTSIDE OF THEIR TRADITIONAL ROLE IN ORDER TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO CARE. COMMUNITY PARAMEDICS TO RIGOROUSLY LICENSE AND EXTENSIVELY TRAINED. TO MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS IN THE FIELD ARE REGARDING A DECISION TO TRANSPORT- SOMEONE WHETHER IT'S TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. OR TO A STROKE CENTER OR TRAUMA CENTER OR OTHER FORMS OF SPECIALIZED FACILITIES. TO HELP SOMEONE WITH WHAT THEY NEED MAYBE FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR GIVES LOCAL AGENCIES THE AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP THESE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS. AND REQUIRES THE STATE OF FLORIDA. THE STATE TO DEVELOP MINIMAL MEDICAL STANDARDS THIS IS A THOUGHTFUL AND BALANCED APPROACH TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND I ASKED HER I GO. YOU KNOW DO IT REPORTER.

SENATOR JACKSON'S PREPARED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ AT SOME LEVEL TWELVE EIGHTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARTUCCI AN ACT RELATING TO MOBILITY DEVICES. INTERJECTION THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES MANY OF US HAVE SEEN THESE DEVICES THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES SCOOTERS BIKES AND WHAT HAVE YOU THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES AND THEY HAVE MANY OF THEM HERE IN SACRAMENTO AS WELL. THEY ARE AN OPTION FOR CALIFORNIANS IN MANY CITIES AND CAN BE HELPFUL- TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS THEY SEARCH FOR ECO FRIENDLY LOW COST OPTIONS TO SOLVE THAT LAST MILE PROBLEM A TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM AND CREATE ACCESS FOR TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER IN MANY CITIES THESE DEVICES HAVE APPEARED OFTEN OVER NIGHT. AND DAY LEAVE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO CREATE POLICIES AROUND THE ISSUE WITHOUT ANY FRAMEWORK AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE MOBILITY DEVICES OF COURSE THERE ARE PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS FOR WRITERS AS WELL AS THE USERS OF THE BIKES. THIS MEASURE CREATES A STATEWIDE MINIMUM STANDARD REQUIRED FOR SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES WITH THE REQUIREMENT THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES ADOPT AND COMPLY WITH SAFETY RULES AND THAT THERE BE MINIMUM INSURANCE OR I SHOULD SAY MINIMUM INSURANCE. IN ORDER TO PROTECT RIDERS FROM THIRD PARTIES RECENT AMENDMENTS SADLY. REMOVE THE WAIVER PROVISION. THAT HAS ALLOWED COMPANIES TO REQUIRE THAT RIDERS WAVE A LIABILITY OF THESE COMPANIES. BUT BY REMOVING THAT. THE INDUSTRY HEN ALL OPPONENTS AS I UNDERSTAND IT HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SO IT IS NOT QUITE THE BILL I HAD HOPED BUT IT DOES REQUIRE THAT WE START ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE AND THESE PIPES ARE THESE BIKES AND MOBILITY DEVICES- TO AT LEAST CREATE A BASIC FRAMEWORK FOR THEIR USE AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. I SEE NO HANDS HERE. REMOTELY WE HAVE SENATOR GORGEOUS. THANK YOU. WHEN THIS MATTER CAME TO JUDICIARY I THINK MOST OF THE AREAS OF DISCUSSION WERE ALL ON THE WAIVER- I HAD HEARTBURN UPON THAT- AND WE GOT OURSELVES BACK AND FORTH ON. A NEW ONCE LEGAL MATTER BUT ALL ULTIMATELY EVERYONE AGREED THAT YOU CANNOT WAIVE THROUGH A LEGAL INSTRUMENT MANUFACTURER LIABILITY. SO THAT THERE WERE OTHER REASONS WHY A WAIVER WAS SOUGHT IN ANOTHER REASON WHY WEAVER. THERE IS A DESIRE TO REMOVE THE WAIVER FROM THE TRANSACTION BUT AS IT TURNS OUT NOW THIS BILL HAS JUST BECOME A MINIMUM INSURANCE COVERAGE- A LOT OF POLICY ON THE SCOOTER COMPANIES SO MY FORMER OPPOSITION WAS BECAUSE OF THE WAIVER AND IN ITS CURRENT FORM I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY SUPPORTABLE. AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THE OPPOSITION THAT EXISTED BEFORE AS EITHER REMOVED OR GONE NEUTRAL SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SINNER MORLOCK WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO. SHARE MR PRESIDENT I I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED WHEN WE ADDRESS NEW TECHNOLOGIES OF THIS NATURE ACT SOME MEMBER TAKING MY OLDEST SON WHEN HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD TO THE BASE OF HALF DOME AND LOOK AT THE CABLE AND- I SAID THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO GO TO THE TOP AND HE SAID NO DAD WE'RE NOT GOING BECAUSE- AND SO. WE GET. BETTER BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT WHEN WE DO CERTAIN THINGS- BECAUSE FANS ARE ACTIVITIES ARE GONNA BE SOME. ELEMENT OF RISK IN IT AND IT SHOULD BE ON US IF WE'RE GOING TO. GET ON A SCOOTER OR- OR SOME TYPE OF VEHICLE WE KNOW THAT WE ARE TAKING CERTAIN RISKS I JUST THINK WE NEED TO BE REAL CAUTIOUS. WHEN WE TAKE ON. SOME OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND IMPOSING A NOVEL LEGAL STANDARD THAT IS ONLY APPLICABLE. TO SURE. MICRO BILITY INDUSTRY. YOU KNOW SEEMS A LITTLE. HARSH PATEL I'M GLAD THAT THERE'S AT LEAST SOME- AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE. HAVE KIND OF TURNED IT DOWN SO THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT FOR LETTING ME. SHARE. MY THOUGHTS. THANK YOU. IN ADDITION TO. OF THE RAID ON THE ITEM. HEARING CHAIN NINE CENTER JACKSON GEORGIA CLOSE YES I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT MINIMUM INSURANCE THIS IS REQUIRING COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY IS HERE AND THAT IT DOES- POTENTIALLY SERVE A VERY POSITIVE PURPOSE WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION BUT IT ALSO DOES HAVE SOME ISSUES AND SO- COMMUNITIES ARE. GOING TO NOW BE REQUIRED TO CREATE SOME KIND OF A- IF YOU WILL OF WORKING- DIRECTIVE FOR THE USE OF THESE BIKES- WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THE LIABILITY ISSUE I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT WE JUST DON'T SIMPLY. ASSUME EVERY RISK OF EVERYTHING- BUT THAT ISN'T PART OF THE BILL NOW SO WE CAN HAVE THAT DISCUSSION SOME OTHER TIME. THE BILL DOES HAVE VERY POSITIVE IMPACTS IT IS A FIRST STEP IN MY OPINION. BUT THE AUTHOR HAS CHOSEN TO- TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE FROM A VERY BASIC LEVEL IT'S AN IMPORTANT LEVEL A IT'S A START OF A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION ABOUT A POTENTIALLY VERY POSITIVE FORM OF TRANSPORTATION. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE. MMHM SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN HI ARCHULETA I AT KINS I FELL. BRADFORD CABRERA I DODD FIVE THE RUSSELL. I GOT JOHNNY. LASER GONZALES.

WE WILL NOW TO FALL I'M SIXTY SEVEN SENATOR DODD HE'S PREPARED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE RING AV. FIFTEEN OH SIX. ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN OH SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY AN ACT RELATING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. SENATOR DODD MR PRESIDENT SENATORS ARRIVES THE FLOOR MANAGER AND A PROUD PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF AB FIFTEEN OH SIX THE CALIFORNIA DEADLY FORCE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. CURRENTLY THERE IS ALARMING SKEPTICISM AND A PERCEIVED CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN THE CURRENT IF PROCESSES FOR DEADLY FORCE INCIDENTS PARTICULARLY WITH LOCAL DJS INVESTIGATING COPS THEY WORK MOST CLOSELY WITH. AFTER SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE CASES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE STATE- WITH NO CHARGES FILED INCLUDING A RECENT POLICE SHOOTING IN MY DISTRICT IT'S CLEAR. WE MUST HAVE BEEN BETTER INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED. AB FIFTEEN OH SIX WOULD ESTABLISH A STATE PROSECUTOR TO INVESTIGATE POLICE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF AN UNARMED CIVILIAN. THE STATE PROSECUTOR'S DUTIES WOULD INCLUDE CONDUCTING AN INVEST INVESTIGATION GATHERING FACTS PROVIDING WRITTEN FINDINGS IN WHEN NECESSARY PROSECUTING THE OFFICERS INVOLVED. LASTLY AB FIFTEEN OH SIX INCREASES ACCOUNTABILITY BY ALLOWING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO REQUEST THE D. O. G. D. O. J. EXCUSE ME TO REVIEW THEIR DEPARTMENTS PATTERNS AND PRACTICES AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT NEW FIVE OTHER STATES REQUIRE THEM IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO STEP UP. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THERE BEEN ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED FATAL SHOOTINGS BY POLICE IT LESS THAN FIVE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS WERE CONDUCTED. WE'VE SEEN TOO MANY FAMILIES GRIEVING SENSELESS KILLINGS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THIS MUST STOP. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU CENTER DOT MEMBERS IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR YES SENATOR NIELSEN. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE. SHOULD OTHER. OVERREACTION THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I CONSIDER IT OVER THE TOP TOO MUCH. THERE'S PLENTY OF BEST TO GATING. RIGHT NOW THE GOES ON. AND EVEN THEN IT'S A DEAD SEVEN CITED SO EGREGIOUS. THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING PROSECUTED NOW. WE HAVE THE MEANS TO DISCIPLINE. THIS IS REALLY HEADED TOWARDS OPEN SEASON. ON LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY FOR US. THEY'LL TELL YOU A STORY IS VERY MOVING THAT DOES MAKE A POINT. THE NERO DAM SPILLWAY FAILED I WAS TALKING TO THE SHERIFF OF THAT COUNTY. ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT. AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT 'M GONNA DO I'M GETTING CONFLICTING AND PINION SHIN THAT APARTMENT A WATER RESOURCES AND THAT'S WHAT COREY HERE'S WHAT YOU DO YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION AS YOU SEE IT. I WILL NOT BE BEHIND YOU I WILL NOT BE BESIDE YOU. I'LL BE IN FRONT OF THE- YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION. THEN ANY OBSERVATION OPTING. HE SAID JIM THEN I'M ON THE THRESHOLD. OF ORDERING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. ARE THE WAY OF TROUBLE. TO ACHIEVE THAT. I HAVE TO ORDER MY PEOPLE. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN TO HARM'S WAY. TO DO THAT. THEY DO PROVIDE COURAGEOUSLY THEY DON'T ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT. YES JUSTICE WILL BE DONE. AND AS USUAL BELIEVE FULLY EMBRACE THESE LAW ENFORCEMENT BILLS. DON'T BE HYPOCRITES COME. THE DAY THAT WE CROSS THE STREET. TO HONOR THE SLAIN OFFICERS OF THAT YEAR BUT THE PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL. I IMMEDIATELY TO THE WEST OF HERE. DON'T BEARS YOURSELVES GOING IN FRONT OF THOSE GRIEVING FAMILY MEMBERS. THE WEEPING WIVES. THE STANDARD STARING INTO SPACE CHILDREN. YES. THERE IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE. ON YOUR MIND I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR MITCHELL. JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN DONE. AND FOR THE CONTINUED INFERENCE THAT THE LIVES OF BLACK MEN AND WOMEN AND BROWN MEN AND WOMEN. WHO HAD BEEN KILLED AT THE HANDS OF POLICE. CAN BE IGNORED CONTINUES TO BE INSULTING. NO ONE STANDS HERE ON THIS FLOOR AND SAYS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE TO BE RESPECTED. AND HONORED AND SUPPORTED I DO THAT REGULARLY WHEN I SUPPORT BILLS IN LABOR COMMITTEE THAT SUPPORTS THEM. BUT IT IS NOT OKAY. TO IGNORE. THE RISK FOUR BLACK MEN ONE IN ONE THOUSAND CHANCE OF BEING KILLED AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT IS NOT OKAY TO DENY CONTINUOUSLY THAT REALITY. AB FIFTEEN OH SIX WOULD ESTABLISH A STATE PROSECUTOR TO INVESTIGATE POLICE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AND THE DEATH OF AN UN ARMED CIVILIANS. HOW PRAY TELL IS THAT DISRESPECTING AND NOT HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT I ABSOLUTELY WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO GO ACROSS THE STREET AND HONOR THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN DUTY AND I WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO STAND HERE AND SAY. THAT THOSE WHO TAKE AN OATH TO PROTECT AND SERVE ALL OF US FAIRLY. IT'S FAIR AND APPROPRIATE EXPECTATION. IT IS NOT EITHER OR. I AGAIN WILL BE STANDING IN SUPPORT OF A B. ONE FIVE OH SIX IT'S AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY. IT SIMPLY CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INVESTIGATIONS TO OCCUR BECAUSE JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN SERVED IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE MURDER OF BLACK MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ACROSS THE STATE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM ALL OF WHOM ARE ON ARMED AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A COMMON SENSE MEASURE I CAN ASSURE YOU IF WHITE AMERICANS WERE BEING KILLED AT THE SAME RATE AS AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS ARE BEING KILLED NOT ONLY IN THE STATE BUT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY YOU'D BE CALLING FOR THE DISBANDMENT OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. BUT BECAUSE IT'S BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. ALL THAT YOU HAVE NEVER TRULY EVER VALUE THEIR LIVES IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S LIKE HOLDS. THEY MUST THE DESERVED IT IT SHOULD BE TELLING WHEN YOU HAVE A N. B. A. STAR WHO PLAYED ON TV AND I DIDN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT HIS ROLE IS BUT TO HAVE A PLATFORM. LIKE LEBRON JAMES HAS AND HE SAYS AS A BLACK MAN. AS A BLACK WOMAN AS A BLACK CHILD WE FEAR THE POLICE. FAR TOO OFTEN YOU SEE AFRICAN AMERICANS RUNNING FROM THE POLICE NOT BECAUSE THEY COMMITTED ANY CRIME. BECAUSE THEY FEAR THE POLICE AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER MY LIFETIME IF THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU. YOU WOULD FEAR THE POLICE TOO BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS SO TO HAVE A METHOD. OF INVESTIGATING. LAW ENFORCEMENT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE KILLED UNARMED. CITIZENS REGARDLESS OF THEIR COLOR SHOULD BE COMMON SENSE AND WE SHOULD ALL SUPPORT. I HAVE A FAMILY THAT'S BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AS I TOLD THE STORY I CAME CLOSE TO BEING A POLICE OFFICER I HAVE A FRIEND FROM. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL WAY TO COLLEGE. WHO JUST RETIRED FROM THIRTY FIVE YEARS AS AN LAPD OFFICER AT THIRTY FIVE YEARS HE NEVER ONCE FIRED HIS WEAPON BUT HE TOLD ME MANY OF THE STORIES OF THE FACT THAT. HE KNEW WHEN ONE OF HIS PARTNERS WAS GOING TO FIRE HIS WEAPON BECAUSE IT WAS A BLACK OR BROWN PERSON AND THEY AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME THAT THEY WERE FROM. SO THEY HAVE A METHOD TO INVESTIGATE POLICE OFFICERS THIS IS COMMON SENSE THIS IS ACTUALLY SUPPORTS POLICE THIS IS A PRO PLEASE MEASURE BECAUSE ALL EVERYBODY SAYS WE WANT TO GET RID OF THE BACK OFFICE. AND HELP US GET RID OF THE BAD COPS YOU CAN'T GET RID OF THEM IF YOU DON'T HAVE A METHOD OF INVESTIGATING. THE SHOOTINGS. THIS ALL THIS BILL REQUIRES IS ASKING FOR A METHOD IN WHICH TO INVESTIGATE THOSE SHOOTINGS BECAUSE- IF YOU'RE NOT APPALLED AT WHAT WE SAW. IN WISCONSIN THE OTHER DAY THEN YOU HAVE NO CONSCIOUS FEELING ABOUT A HUMAN BEING TO GET SHOT SEVEN TIMES IN THE BACK. AND HE'S LUCKY HE'S STILL ALIVE. WHAT IS THREE. IN A CAR. I'M MAD WE ALL SHOULD BE MET BECAUSE THE CONTINUE TO SAY THAT JUSTICE IS COLOR BLIND IS THE BIGGEST LIE WE TELL IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS NOT COLOR BLIND. SO AGAIN IT'S MEMBERS TO TALK ABOUT DEFINING THE PLEASE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT DEFINING THE POLICE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE. WE DO NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY WE NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKS ON IT IT'LL BE A- MEASURE. WELL APPLYING WAIT JUST AS IT DOES IN THOSE ARE A FLUENT COMMUNITY SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MELODRAMA PULL UP THEIR IMAGE VICE CHAIR OF A LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THESE MEASURES WILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD CENTRE SKINNER. THANK YOU I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE HEARD IT IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. THE TESTIMONY WAS THOROUGH THE DISCUSSION IN THE ANALYSIS WAS THOROUGH. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WHILE I DO NOT HAVE THE EXACT STATISTICS FOR CALIFORNIA. WE ARE AVERAGING IN THE UNITED STATES OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE FATALLY SHOT BY POLICE ANNUALLY. AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. ONLY FOUR HUNDRED OFFICERS WERE CHARGED AND THAT'S AFTER THAT'S A THOUSAND A YEAR OF DEATHS. GET OVER MULTIPLE YEARS ONLY A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED OFFICERS HAVE BEEN CHARGED. AND ONLY FORTY TWO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AND THAT'S ACROSS THE US IN CALIFORNIA. AND EVEN FEWER. NOW I AM NOT NECESSARILY ARGUING THAT OFFICERS BE CONVICTED. WHAT I AM ARGUING FOR IS THE ABILITY FOR AN INVESTIGATION TO HAPPEN AND WE FACED NOW WERE MANY MANY SHOOTINGS OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS HAVE NOT HAD AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION. AND FAMILIES COMMUNITIES. AND OTHERS HAVE FELT THAT THERE IS NO ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER PROTOCOLS WERE FOLLOWED OR WHETHER THERE WAS LEGITIMATE. WHETHER THAT WAS A- WHETHER THE OFFICER WAS- EXONERATED LEGITIMATELY OR NOT AND I THINK THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR JUSTICE ESSENTIAL FOR BUILDING TRUST WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AND NECESSARY TO CORRECT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN VERY WRONG FOR YEARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER CENTER JACKSON. YES VERY BRIEFLY I HAD A DISCUSSION WITH THE DA OF MY COUNTY SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WHO IS ALSO THE- I BELIEVE IT'S C. PRESIDENT OF POST POLICE OFFICER TRAININGS. AND ASKED HER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THIS BILL AND SHE SAID IT'S ABOUT TIME. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON SENATOR PORTENT TINO. THANK YOU ADAM. PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF A B. FIFTEEN OH SIX AND ALSO ON A RISE. IN COMPLIMENT- THE AUTHOR FROM SACRAMENTO WHO IS BEEN SO PASSIONATE- ON THIS ISSUE AND DILIGENTLY WORKING WITH THE CHAIR OF. THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THE CHAIR FROM- BERKELEY AS WELL THEY HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY- IN THE LAST WEEK TO. REMOVE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THE REIMBURSEMENT FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT LITTLE PIECE. MAKES IT MORE. PALATABLE AND MORE LIKELY THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL SEE THIS INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION HAPPENED AND SO I JUST WANT TO COMPLIMENT- THE AUTHOR. THE CHAIR AND THE FINAL RESULT IN- RESPECTFULLY- ASK EVERYONE TO VOTE I AM FIFTEEN OH SIX. THANK YOU SIR PORTENT TINO. SENATOR RAZA. THIS WEEK I WISH I HAD TIME TO WATCH ALL THE DIFFERENT GAMES ON TV SPORTS THAT WERE TAKING PLACE AND WHEN I LOOK TO SEE WHAT I MISSED I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY HAD ALL DECIDED TO BOYCOTT BIT ALL DECIDED TO NOT. PLAY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL DEMANDING THAT THERE BE JUSTICE. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE ATHLETES AND PLAYERS. THEY ARE SHOWING. THEY ARE TELLING US WHAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE TELLING US AS WELL SO I RISE. TO SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS A SENATOR PAM. HANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SATURDAY TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS A VERY IMPORTANT- BILL AND I STAND WITH MY GOOD FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE- WHO REPRESENTS SACRAMENTO AS WELL- THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL- SO MEMBER MCCARTY- WE NEED TO RESTORE TRUST. THIS IS WHAT REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO WE HAVE. OUR BELONG FOR SPENT OFFICERS WHO ARE DOING THEIR WORK BUT WE ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITY. WITH WITH VIOLENCE AND POLICE BRUTALITY AND WE NEED TO RESTORE TRUST AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT. AND US TRUST AND FAIRNESS AND SO LET'S PASS THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR WE'RE GOING TO GO TO OUR MEMBERS FOR PARTICIPATING REMOTELY I HAVE FOUR HANDS UP SENATOR BORCHERS GROVE MELINDA'S AND MORE LOCK WE'RE GONNA START WITH SENATOR BORJAS. SENATOR GORGEOUS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THERE'S A LOT OF PASSION IN THE ROOM AND NO DOUBT- THERE ARE A LOT OF GRIEVANCES HISTORICAL AND PRESENT ON IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND THE TRUST THAT PEOPLE FEEL NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED UPON BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT I KIND OF WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK. AND GO TO SIFT THROUGH THE OUTRAGE THAT IS BEING EXPERIENCED AND FELT IN TRYING TO GET TO THE THRUST OF WHAT IS THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE AG HAS ALWAYS HAD THE AUTHORITY. TO INITIATE AN INVESTIGATION. INTO POLICE MISCONDUCT. R. AND IMPROPER INVESTIGATIONS AS WELL AS THE CALCULATIONS THE RATIOS OF THOSE WHO SUFFER AT THE HANDS. OF BAD APPLES IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I DON'T THINK I FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS NEEDED IF WE DEMAND IS A COMMUNITY. THERE BE TRANSPARENCY THAT THEY'RE BEING INITIATION BY THE AG'S OFFICE EITHER BY DISPATCHED ATTORNEY OR BY THE CREATION OF A SUBDIVISION WITHIN THE AG'S OFFICE. HAVEN'T THEY ALWAYS HAD THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS SO THAT'S WHY I'M JUST KIND OF PUZZLED THAT IN OUR CURRENT OUTRAGE AND DESPERATION FOR LEGISLATION HAVE WE EVER ASKED HOW WE HELD OUR CURRENT AG AND THOSE BEFORE- THE CURRENT AG ACCOUNTABLE. THAT THIS IS A COMMUNITY DEMANDS AND MAYBE NOT JUST AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WELL IF THERE ARE FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS BEING VIOLATED. SO I GUESS. R. I WILL I WILL PROBABLY BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD THINK THAT. THIS IS GRANTING POWERS THEY DIDN'T ALREADY EXIST MAYBE WE SHOULD BE ASKING OURSELVES WHY WEREN'T THESE POWERS ACTED UPON. EARLIER. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS THE CENTER GROVE. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I REALIZED AND IT'S JUSTIFIED FOR THE PASSION ON THE SUBJECT MATTERS THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH- BOTH I'M FROM BOTH SIDES IT'S SAM. I DON'T THINK ANYONE OF US- I KNOW NO ONE IN MY CAUCUS AND I DOUBT VERY SERIOUSLY ANYBODY ON IT THE SENATE FLOOR ANY ANYBODY I KNEW. I FOR ONE MOMENT THOUGHT THAT WATCHING SOMEBODY HAVE THEIR KNEE ON THEM FOR A SOLID AND EIGHT AND A HALF MINUTES OR EIGHT MINUTES. EVER LONGER AND- IT WAS NOT IT WAS NOT RIGHT WE WATCHED IN THE END AND DIE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US MURDERED RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT THAT AT ALL AND I REALIZE THAT THIS IS AN EMOTIONALLY CHARGED ISSUE AND- I DO WANT TO GET BACK TO THE BILL AT HAND IF POSSIBLE THE CONCERN AND WHY CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY IS THAT AND DEAD THE VERSION OF THE BILL IS ODDLY DEFINED AS AN ARMED CIVILIAN- AND IT'S AS THE DEFINITION OF IT IS AS CARRYING AN UNLOADED FIREARM. I ASK YOU TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE POSITION OF A POLICE OFFICER AND WHO IS THAT COMING UP ON SOMEBODY WHO IS DATABASE THINK HAS COMMITTED A CRIME OR IS COMMITTING A CRIME AND DOESN'T MATTER THEIR SKIN COLOR BUT THAT- THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY'RE COMING IN CONTACT WITH PULLS OUT A FIREARM AND HOW DOES THE POLICE OFFICER EVEN KNOWN THAT THAT IS NOT A LOADED FIREARM AND- IF YOU MAKE THE WRONG DECISION AND IT WAS A LOADED FIREARM- THEN THAT COULD COST YOU YOUR LIFE AND NOT YOU NOT BE ABLE TO GO HOME WITH YOUR FAMILY SO. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO RETHINK THIS BILL I THINK IT CAN BE- YOU KNOW CORRECTED AND YOU'LL GET- BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WHICH I KNOW YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT TO PUT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT INTO A POSITION WHERE SOMEBODY PULLS OUT A FIREARM I'M IN THEY HAVE TO MAKE A SPLIT SECOND DECISION TO SEE IF THEY WERE GONNA. BE KILLED OR NOT AND THEN TO COME TO FIND OUT LATER AFTER THEY TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION ACTION. THE THREAT IS THAT HOW IT'S TRAIN WE GO THROUGH TRAINING FOR YOU KNOW CCW TRAINING EVERYTHING- IF YOU WERE TO LEMONADE WHAT APPEARS AT THAT MOMENT TO BE A THREAT AND THEN FIND OUT LATER THAT IT WAS- AND UNLOADED FIREARMS THAT'S A PRETTY TOUGH CALL TO MAKE FOR SOMEBODY IN A HEIGHTENED SITUATION IN IN AN EMOTIONALLY CHARGED SITUATION OR IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SPLIT SECOND DECISION AND TO NOTE TO THINK THAT YOUR LIFE IS ON THE LINE AS WELL- SO I THINK THAT. THAT DEFINITION THAT SAYS- A KEY IT'S A DEFINED AS AN UNARMED CIVILIAN AS ONE CARRYING AN UNLOADED FIREARM AND THAT'S A VERY BROAD AND I'M NOT A GOOD JUST NOT A GOOD- DESCRIPTION OF A BILL THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND- FIXED SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK REMOTE. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE SENATOR MELINDA'S. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST VERY BRIEFLY- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE HERE WITH VERY. REAL AND SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. AND I KNOW THAT. THROUGH THE PROCESS THE AUTHOR KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED- ON THAT HE SAID WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED AFTER THE LEGISLATION PASSED. ON GIVEN THE SERIOUSNESS OF WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS. THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION TO. ADDRESS CONCERNS OR PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL AFTER THE LEGISLATION IS PASSED I THINK WE OWE IT TO. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THOSE WHO HAVE ENCOUNTERS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET THIS BILL RIGHT AND GET IT. GET IT RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND NOT HAVE TO KEEP MAKING CHANGES TO IT LATER ON- SO I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR. YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MELINDA CINDER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I AM VOTED FOR AB FIFTEEN OH SIX AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THE KILLING OF AN UNARMED PERSON. IT IS DESERVING OF AN INVESTIGATION WHETHER THE PERSON IS WHITE. BLACK BROWN MALE FEMALE PERSON OF FAITH OR NOT YOU KNOW ALL THE CHARACTER. I RECENTLY LISTEN. TO CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST AND AUTHOR JOHN PERKINS LEADER IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY AUTHOR OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS PERSONAL FRIEND CASTER TO. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON AND- HE WAS DISCUSSING THE ROLE OF FAITH AND HEALING RACIAL DIVISIONS. AND HE REFERRED TO A SONG. THAT I USED TO SING WHEN I WAS A CHILD. IT GOES LIKE THIS. JESUS LOVES ALL THE LITTLE CHILDREN. ALL THE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD RED AND YELLOW BLACK AND WHITE THEY ARE PRECIOUS IN HIS SIGHT JESUS LOVES THE LITTLE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD. BETTER PRESIDENT I ENCOURAGE AND I VOTE. ON A. B. FIFTEEN OH SIX THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER MORLOCK. US SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK OUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING FIFTEEN OH SIX TODAY- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS IT'S I THINK IT'S OVERLY BANK- AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW EARLIER THIS YEAR- IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT TWO DIFFERENT AFTER AMERICAN. WERE FOUND HUNG IN TREES WHICH SEEMS VERY ODD TO ME AS ONE OF THE FIRST ELECTED OFFICIALS TO CALL OUT RELATED INVESTIGATION GOT ON THE PHONE OVER THE WEEKEND TO ATTORNEY GENERAL BECERRA. WHO WAS VERY GRACIOUS AND GOT ENGAGED IMMEDIATELY DURING THAT CONVERSATION I TALKED ABOUT HAVING TO DO MORE HE SAID I DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET TO DO MORE SO. THEY HE CAME IN HE DIDN'T DO AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION BUT HE WAS ALONGSIDE THE F. B. I. AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO WAS INVOLVED. I WILL TELL YOU I THOUGHT I BELIEVE THAT BROUGHT COMFORT TO THE COMMUNITY AT BROUGHT PEACE TO THE COMMUNITY AND WHEN ALL THE FACTS WERE CAME OUT. IN IN THE CONCLUSIONS WERE DRAWN THEY BOTH ENDED. UP BEING CONCLUDED AS SUICIDES. PEOPLE BODY TO THOSE FINDINGS SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S A PERFECT BILL I'M SURE IT HAD TO COME BACK IN AND TWEAK IT AT SOME POINT. BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HOLD EVERYBODY ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT PEOPLE HAVE FAITH IN THEIR GOVERNMENT THAT IT IS TRANSPARENT AND IT IS INDEPENDENT AND IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE TRUTH SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO BE AND I HAD TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER WILL SING NO FURTHER HANDS RAISED IN SEEING NO FURTHER MICROPHONES UP ON THE FLOOR SENATOR DODD PLEASE CLOSE. YES MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE DISCUSSION HERE.

SENATOR BRADFORD THANK YOU I'M HONORED TO JOIN ASSEMBLYMAN MCCARTY OF THE PROD ALTER OF AV TWENTY THREE FORTY TWO THIS BILL ADOPTS A NATION WIDE BEST PRACTICES. TO IMPROVE PAROLE IN CALIFORNIA THE BILL GIVES PEOPLE ON PAROLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN REINTEGRATION CREDITS TO REDUCE THEIR TERMS. ON ALL OF THAT HERE SHE IS ON PAROLE IT IS FOCUSED ON PEOPLE CURRENTLY ON PAROLE SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY THOSE SERVING LIFE ON PAROLE. PEOPLE WHO ARE ON PAROLE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY ARE READY TO REINTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY AND OUR TEAM DID NO LONGER BE A DANGER TO SOCIETY. THIS BILL PROMOTES PUBLIC SAFETY BY INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE ON PAROLE TO PROACTIVELY ENGAGE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WORK BEYOND THEIR CONDITIONS OF PAROLE.

WE HAVE A POPULATION PROBLEM WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM WITHIN THE- REHABILITATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA- OUR PRISONS. FOLKS ARE GETTING OUT EARLIER THAN THEY SHOULD BE- FOLKS ARE NOT GOING IN IT AS THEY DID IN THE PAST AND I THINK THAT AREN'T ALLOWING PAROLE TO. PLAY A LARGER ROLE IN HELPING THESE INDIVIDUALS REINTEGRATE. ACTUALLY SERVES A GREATER PUBLIC POLICY GOAL UNDER THESE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULDN'T ADMIT IT I WOULDN'T HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS ON A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. ONLY BECAUSE I THINK GIVEN INDIVIDUAL COMMITTED A CRIME HERE SHEET SHOULD SERVE OUT THEIR COMPLETE SENSE- BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN CALIFORNIA WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO BE PUT ON PAROLE EARLIER THAN THEY NORMALLY WOULD BE.

SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD EXTEND EXISTING PROTECTIONS AGAINST RETALIATION FOR REFORM REFUSING TO WORK IN HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS TO DOMESTIC WORKERS THE WILDFIRES IN RECENT YEARS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE NEED FOR THIS BILL AND NEWS STORIES HAVE SHOWN US THAT MANY DOMESTIC WORKERS. CONTINUE TO WORK IN HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS OUT OF FEAR THAT THEY'LL FACE ITALIAN IF THEY REFUSED TO DO SO. THERE IS NOTHING IN CURRENT CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE THAT CLEARLY AND EXPRESSLY PREVENTS A DOMESTIC IN. FROM ORDERING A DOMESTIC WORKER TO REMAIN IN A MANDATORY EVACUATION SOME OF A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TO DO SO IN THIS BILL WOULD PROTECT DOMESTIC WORKERS FROM BEING COMPELLED TO ENTER SUCH AREAS IT'S ALSO RELEVANT NOW AS A RESULT OF COLD IT.

ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY SEVENTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER AN ACT RELATING TO JURIES SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT I PROBABLY RISE TODAY. TO PRESENTS ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY SEVENTY ON BEHALF OF DR SHIRLEY WEBER. OUR COLLEAGUES AB THIRTY SEVENTY WILL REDUCE ON LAWFUL DISCRIMINATION PARTICULARLY RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE EXERCISE OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES TO PROSPECTIVE JURORS IN CRIMINAL CASES. I'M CALLING TO SEE IF I MAY BE BLUNT- THIS BILL IS ABOUT ENDING WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY MANY YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY- SPECIFICALLY THE EXCLUSION. OF BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES JURIES. A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN WITH US AND THAT UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. WE HAVE FOCUSED VERY JUSTIFIABLY ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. AND AYS THE FEW MINUTES AGO WITH EIGHTY FIFTEEN OH SEX. ON THE CHALLENGES- AND A TERRIBLE SITUATIONS THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FACE WHAT POLICING. AND THE UNACCEPTABLE SHOOTINGS AND MURDERS THAT WE HAVE SEEN. BUT WE NEED TO ALSO BE CLEAR THAT POLICING. IS STEP ONE OF OUR BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM A BROKEN SYSTEM THAT IS PART OF THE STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT WE ARE TRYING TO TEAR DOWN IN THIS COUNTRY. ONCE YOU GET PAST THE POLICING. ENTRY INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. YOU'RE GONNA FACE A TRIAL SYSTEM. THAT IS A PROBLEM AND THAT LEADS TO OVER INCARCERATION AND MASS INCARCERATION. THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH A FAIR TRIAL TO WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED. OUR SUPREME COURT IN CALIFORNIA BAR THIS DISCRIMINATION BARRED THE STRIKING OF PEOPLE BASED ON RACES FROM JURIES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. THE US SUPREME COURT DID THE SAME THING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND THE BATSON DECISION. FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS COURTS AND LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE DEBATED WHETHER THE PROCESS IN EXISTENCE. IS ADEQUATE AT STOPPING ANGEL DISCRIMINATION IN THE SELECTION OF JURIES. CALLING THIS PROCESS THE DATSUN WHEELER PROCESS HAS FAILED. THAT IS ACROSS THE NATION SHOW THE JURIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY WHITES THEY'RE WHITER AND WEALTHIER THAN THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. THE ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER TOLD THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. HE HAS DIFFICULTY GETTING AFRICAN AMERICAN JURORS ON JURIES IN OAKLAND TO THE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. AND I KNOW EVERYONE KNOWS PROTESTING CASE A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE IS ONE ATTORNEY CAN STRIKE SOMEONE FROM A JURY. FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY REASON. AB THIRTY SEVEN IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE EXISTING SUBSTANTIVE LAW BARRING DISCRIMINATION IT'S BEEN ILLEGAL FOR OVER FORTY YEARS THE STRIKE SOMEONE FROM A JURY BASED ON RACE. WHAT IT CHANGES IS THE COURT PROCESS FOR ASSESSING WHETHER A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE IS BASED ON RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. IT MAKES A FEW NEEDED CHANGES AND THE GOAL HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD A BROADER AND FAIRER CROSS SECTION OF OUR COMMUNITY REPRESENTING OUR FULL DIVERSITY. EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY ALLOWS JUDGES TO OBJECT ON THEIR OWN MOTION TO PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES BASED ON CONCERNS BY THE COURT ABOUT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY SHIFTS THE BURDEN FROM THE PERSON WHO IS OBJECTING. TO A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE. TO THE PERSON EXERCISING THE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE THE PERSON WHO EXERCISES THE CHALLENGE WE'LL HAVE TO JUSTIFY IT AS NOT BASED ON RACE. AT THIRTY SEVEN CHANGES THE STANDARD. FROM SUBJECTIVE INTENT TO OBJECT OF ACTION. SO INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PROVE PURPOSEFUL DISCRIMINATION WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT THE ATTORNEY STRUCK SOMEONE BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY INTENDED TO DISCRIMINATE BASED ON RACE. INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHETHER THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD THAT AN OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE PERSON WOULD YOU RACE AS A FACTOR. IN THE USE OF THAT PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE WE KNOW THAT DUE TO IMPLICIT BIAS PEOPLE MAY NOT ALWAYS BE MALICIOUSLY INTENDING TO EXCLUDE SOMEONE BUT THE EFFECT IS THE SAME. GUY THE EXCLUSION WAS BASED ON RACE. THE BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES A NUMBER OF PRESUMPTIVELY INVALID REASONS. FOR A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE. FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY WHO HAVE HAD INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE OR WHO HAVE SOME DEGREE OF SKEPTICISM. OF THE POLICE THERE'S A LAUNDRY LIST OF FACTORS THAT ATTORNEYS HAVE USED TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE EFFECT. OF BEING BASED ON DISPROPORTIONATELY ON RACE. THE V. THIRTY SEVENTY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE DYNAMICS IN JUROR SELECTION TO REDUCE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF THOSE WHO SERVE ON OUR JURIES AND AGAIN WE HAVE TO FUNDAMENTALLY FIX POLICING. BUT IF WE FIX POLICING AND STOP THERE WE HAVE FAILED. AND ONE PIECE THAT WE HAVE TO FIX ITS HOW WE TAKE OUR JURIES AT THIRTY SEVENTY AS LONG OVERDUE. WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL GOING NEUTRAL ON THE BILL AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THIS IS A BILL THAT IS NEEDED. IT IS A IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO STEP IN AND MAKE OUR JURY SYSTEM MORE FAIR AND MORE JUST AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YO SENATOR WIENER MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO GO TO FLORIDA BAY BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA IX IT UP A LITTLE AND WE'RE GONNA GO BACK AND FORTH FROM OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING MORE REMOTELY. BUT WE ARE GOING TO START WITH MADAME PRO TEM. WELL THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. COLLEAGUES THANKS ARRIVES TODAY IN STRONG SO. OF A THIRTY. BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED MECHANISM FOR CALIFORNIA'S COURTS TO ASSESS WHETHER A CHALLENGE TO SOMEONE SERVING A JURY'S BASED ON RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. LOOK I'LL GRANT YOU MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO MENTIONED- ATTORNEYS AND AT. THE ACADEMIC WORLD AND ALL OF THAT I AM CLEARLY NOT THAT BUT- I THINK IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING ON THIS FLOOR. IT IS RACIAL EQUITY AND THE IMPACT. OF SYSTEMIC RACISM IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR SOCIETY AND SO WHEN I SAY THIS IS A MUCH NEEDED MECHANISM I SPEAK AS A LAY PERSON BUT SOMEONE WHO CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACT. ON OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THIS IS A HISTORIC TIME IN OUR NATION AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS I'VE SAID FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT BIAS OBTAINED IN OUR SYSTEMS OF BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT. UNFORTUNATELY OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ITS COURT ROOMS IN JURIES ARE NOT IMMUNE. THE JURY SYSTEM IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT FRONT LINES OF DUE PROCESS INCLUSION AND REPRESENTATION ARE CRITICAL ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM DIVERSITY SHOULD NOT JUST BE A CIRCUMSTANTIAL BONUS. IT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR JURY SYSTEM MOREOVER A JURY OF ONE'S PEERS IS FOUNDATIONAL TO HAVING A FAIR JURY AND OBTAINING A FAIR TRIAL. MAYBE THIRTY SEVENTY IS A STEP TOWARDS PREVENTING ATTORNEYS AND JUDGES FROM UNFAIRLY REMOVING PEOPLE FROM A JURY. COOL BASED ON ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED RACE ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN. AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO INTERPRET THE STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO PERMEATE PERMEATE OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. EIGHTY THIRTY SEVEN IS A CHANCE FOR US TO RIGHT THIS WRONG WE TALKED THE TALK AND NOW I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO WALK THE WALK I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I THOUGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A REMOTE VOTERS I HAVE ONE HAND UP AND THAT IS SENATOR BORCHERS SENATOR GORGEOUS. THANK YOU. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL AND I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM SHOULD BE BECAUSE- ITS IMPACT IS SO. FOUNDATIONAL THAT THIS IS NOT. YOUR EVERYDAY TYPE OF LEGISLATION THAT COMES ACROSS OUR DESK THIS IS THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE VIRTUALLY EVERY ASPECT OF COURTROOM PROCEEDINGS OFFICES CONDUCT THEMSELVES IN THE JUDICIAL ARM OR IN THE- PROSECUTORIAL PROCESS. AND I WOULDN'T WANT US TO JUMP INTO THIS NOT AT LEAST ADDRESSING SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS. I THINK THE IDEA BEHIND IT IS TO EQUALIZE ARE THE JURY POOL AND ALLOW IT TO BE MORE REPRESENTATIVE. OF THE COMMUNITY BUT THE LEGAL TRADITION THAT HAS DEVELOPED. IN JURY SELECTION. HAS BASICALLY ALLOWED THE PARTIES TO SH TO- TO ELIMINATE ALL POTENTIAL JURORS WITHOUT COST WITHOUT HAVING TO EXPLAIN THEMSELVES. AND I THINK GATHERS AND BENEFITS THERE'S ALSO DRAWBACKS COMMUNITY DRAWBACKS TO THAT. BUT TO CREATE. AS A MATTER OF LAW THAT AID DISMISSAL OF A JUROR ON THE WAR IT FEATURES NOT SELECTED THAT IT MUST BE FOR COSTS AND THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL ATTORNEY SEEKING TO REMOVE SOMEONE FROM THE POOL HOUSE TO PROVE UP WHY THEY'RE DOING IT IN WAYS THAT DON'T PERTAIN TO. ETHNICITY GENDER SEX. NATIONALITY RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION. I THINK IS GOING TO CREATE AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF PROBLEMS THOSE I THINK CAN BE OVERCOME IT'S THE OTHER THINGS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS BILL SPECIFIES THAT BEING INATTENTIVE. HAVING A PROBLEMATIC ATTITUDE OR PROVIDING UNINTELLIGENT OR CONFUSED ANSWERS. ARE PRESUMPTIVELY INVALID. UNLESS THE TRIAL COURT IS ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE ASSERTIVE BEHAVIOR OCCURRED AND THEN ONLY IF THE MOVING PARTY CAN PROVE THAT THE BEHAVIOR MATTERS TO THE CASE. THIS IS NOT JUST REVERSING THE BONUS. THIS IS TAKING AWAY FUNDAMENTAL. FUNCTIONALITY OF THE JURY POOL. THAT YOU GIVE SOMEONE CANNOT PAY ATTENTION OR SOMEONE IS ABSOLUTELY GET ATTENTIVE CANNOT IS NOT PROCESSING THE CONVEYANCE OF EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION. DISALLOWING THAT INDIVIDUAL TO BE RMOVED I THINK IS. IT IT IT DEFIES LOGIC ARIANNA I THINK THAT THIS CAN BE REDRAFTED BUT LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET THAT THIS IS ALSO GOING TO APPLY TO CIVIL TRIALS IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX. WE ARE FOR THIS BILL. ATTEMPTS TO WRITE EVERY HISTORICAL INJUSTICE AS MANIFESTED IN THE JURY PROCESS AND I THINK IT IS WITH SUCH A HEAVY HAMMER BUT THERE WILL BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THIS DESERVES TO BE BROUGHT BACK IN JANUARY I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO APPRECIATE THE GRAVITY OF THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NO GOING BACK THIS DESERVES A MORE THOROUGH NON. COATED TRUNCATED LEGISLATIVE CYCLE WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD IN THIS BE GIVEN THE FULL VETTING OF ALL THE RELEVANT COMMITTEES BECAUSE I THINK AT TIS POINT CERTAIN FOLKS ARE. BEING ABLE TO OPPORTUNISTIC LEAD STREAMLINED THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BECAUSE WE HAVE REDUCED OUR LEGISLATIVE CYCLE TO SUCH A DEGREE AND WE'RE LETTING SOMETHING AS SIGNIFICANT AS THIS PASSED THROUGH. THIS WILL BE A PROBLEM I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES EVEN THOSE THAT WANT TO SUPPORT THIS. THIS DESERVES MORE VETTING PLEASE RESPECTFULLY ABSTAIN OR- OPPOSE THIS WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT BE BROUGHT BACK IN JANUARY. THANK YOU SENATOR BARGES SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I WANT TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM AT LEAST 90% OF THEM. THIS IS AN ISSUE I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE SIMPLY WOMAN WEBER BECAUSE SHE HAS ADDRESSED AN ISSUE THAT IS A PROBLEM HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN A PROBLEM. THIRTY YEARS AGO OR THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE U. S. SUPREME COURT TRIED TO DRESS IN THE- DECISION ON HIS BATS AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO POINTS OUT ISN'T QUITE WORK THE WAY. WE WOULD HOPE IT WOULD WORK. BUT I AGREE WITH JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL JUSTICE MARSHALL SAID PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES WHICH WERE THROWN OUT. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM SOMETIME AGO ARE INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE YOU'RE EXERCISING A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE BASED ON BIAS YOU'RE EXERCISING IT BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATION OF A POTENTIAL JUROR WHAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR HANDS WHAT SHOES THEY'RE WEARING WHAT THEY MIGHT BE READING WHO THEY TALKED TO ON THE JURY POOL THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO GO ON. AND SO JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL WAS RIGHT HE SAID WE SHOULD ELIMINATE THE MALL AND I AGREE WITH HIM. WHAT I'VE DONE IS I'VE STUDIED THIS IN IN IN FACT THIS IS THE DOCTRINAL. BASIS FOR A. B. THIRTY SEVEN. IT'S A WORK BY UC BERKELEY DEATH PENALTY CLINIC ENTITLED WHITE WATCHING THE JURY BOX. AND IT IS WELL DONE I MAY NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF IT IS WELL DONE. AND WHAT IT SAYS AND WHAT ITS CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE ARE OTHER PLACES OTHER STATES THEY'RE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE. IN FACT WASHINGTON STATE WAS FIRST AMONG THE STATES. IN FACT BUT WITH YOUR PERMISSION MA'AM PRO TEMPERAMENTAL PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO READ WITHOUT OBJECTION IT IT. IT QUOTES. JUSTICE GONZALEZ IS THE FATHER OF WHAT'S KNOWN AS GENERAL THIRTY SEVEN WASH AND STATE. IT SAYS. IN THE DOCUMENTS IS TIED FOR TO SET A DECISIVE COURSE CORRECTION BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE NOW. WE NEED LOOK NO FURTHER THAN WASHINGTON'S EXAMPLE TO MAKE THIS POINT STUDIES LEADING TO THE ADOPTION OF. G. R. THIRTY SEVEN IDENTIFIED THE SAME INTRACTABLE DISCRIMINATORY JURY SELECTION PRACTICES UNDER BATS OF. THE WASHINGTON SUPREME COURT IMPLEMENTED A PRACTICAL WORKABLE SOLUTION THROUGH G. R. THIRTY SEVEN WHICH IS THE BASIS FOR A B. THIRTY SEVENTY. BUT AT THIRTY SEVENTY. GOES WELL BEYOND AND IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN WASHINGTON STATE. AP THIRTY SEVEN EXCUSE ME A. B. THIRTY SEVENTY GOES SO FAR BEYOND THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN JUDICIAL OFFICERS SAID WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN WASHINGTON A COUPLE YEARS AGO. CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION SAID THERE NEEDS TO BE AMENDMENTS AND LET ME ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF THIS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE YOU EXERCISE PEREMPTORIES BASED ON JUST SOME VERY RUDIMENTARY HELLO THAT INFORMATION UNLESS YOU'RE WEALTH UNLESS YOU HIRE A JURY CONSULTANT. WHO CAN LOOK IN. PROVIDE YOU INFORMATION AS TO WHO MIGHT BE FAVORABLE NOT BE FAVORABLE ONLY THE WEALTHY CAN DO THAT. BY THE WAY. BUT LET ME GIVE YOU AN ILLUSTRATION SO LONG TIME AGO AS FEDERAL PROSECUTOR NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE ORANGE COUNTY. THERE WAS A FAMILY AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY LIVED IN WESTMINSTER. SKIN HAS DECIDED TO DRIVE THEM OUT OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. BY BURNING A CROSS ON THE FRONT LAWN. AT THAT TIME THERE WERE NO HATE CRIME LAWS ON THE BOOKS. WE HAD A LAW A FEDERAL LAW THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T INTERFERE WITH SOMEONE IN THEIR EXERCISE OF THEIR RIGHT. TO OWN ON OCCUPIED HOUSING. WAS A MISDEMEANOR. BUT WE TOOK IT AND WE COMBINED WITH A CONSPIRACY TO MAKE IT A FELONY. NOW WE BEGIN THE TRIAL. I LOOKED AT THE JURY POOL. BASED ON JUST LOOKING AT THEM I HAD TO MAKE CERTAIN ASSESSMENTS. I SAW THAT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE AFRICAN AMERICAN AMONG THEM BUT BEHIND ME IN THE VENEER. OR TO AFRICAN AMERICANS. AND I DESPERATELY WANTED AN AFRICAN AMERICAN ON THE JURY. BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN UNDERSTAND. WHAT BURNING A CROSS ON SOMEONE'S FRONT LAWN MEANT. BECAUSE THE DEFENSE WAS THIS WAS A PRANK THIS IS JUST A NEIGHBORHOOD CORAL OUT OF CONTROL BURNING A CROSS IS NOT A PRANK IT WAS AN ACT OF TERRORISM. AN ACT OF TERRORISM OVERCOME THAT DEFENSE I WANTED SOMEBODY ON THE JURY THEY COULD EXPLAIN THAT AND SO I LOOKED AT THE JURY POOL AND BASED ON CLOTHING AND OTHER THINGS I BOUNCED MEMBERS UNTIL AGAIN AFRICAN AMERICAN JUROR ON THE JURY POOL. IN THAT BOX SO THEY COULD. PRESUMABLY EXPLAIN WHY THIS WAS AN ACT OF TERROR. NOW I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING THAT'S JUST A SMALL EXAMPLE THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE. AND IT IS ONE EXAMPLE. BUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE MANY EXAMPLES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE. A BLACK VICTIM. AND YOU HAVE A WHITE OFFICER BECAUSE THIS WORKS BOTH WAYS IT DOES BASICALLY ELIMINATE THE PROSECUTION'S RIGHT PRINTER EARLY CHALLENGE BUT THAT HIS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THAT IS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE THERE COULD BE MUCH MORE CHALLENGING. WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST THIS BILL IS NOT EFFECTIVE EVEN BY ITS OWN LANGUAGE TILL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THAT WE DO IS TAKE A STEP BACK AND WE SPEND SOME TIME EXAMINING THIS VERY PROFOUND CHANGE TO OUR TRIAL PROCEDURE. WHEN WE COME UP PERHAPS WE DID NOT GENERALLY THIRTY SEVEN AS A SUGGESTED BY JUSTICE CAN THOUSAND WATCHING STATE. BUT WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK BEFORE WE JUMP LISTEN WE CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I URGE FOLKS TO AT LEAST STAY OFFICE BILL SO WE HAVE A CHANCE TO CRAFT THE MECHANISM THAT IS FAIR TO ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG SENATOR JACKSON. IS THANK YOU. MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES IDEA HIM. STANDING HERE IS ONE OF A FEW. WHO IS ACTUALLY PICKED A JURY. IN A CRIMINAL CASE IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS. IT IS AS FEDERER ON BURKE SAYS OFTEN TIMES YOU USE YOUR INTUITION. YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE OF THE CASE. WHAT KIND OF INSURANCE DO YOU WANT. AND YES WE HAVE TRIED TO PROTECT AGAINST RACIAL BIAS IN OTHER BIASES BY A DECISION THAT IS THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS OLD I BELIEVE- BACK IN THE EIGHTIES- AND THERE IS A THERE THERE IS A PROCESS IF THERE IS A BELIEF THAT BIAS IS BEING EXERCISED. AND THE JUDGE IS SUPPOSED TO A CHALLENGE- THAT KIND OF SERIAL DISMISSAL OF A JUROR WITHOUT BECAUSE HE'S JUST I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THAT JUROR LOOKS SORE I WANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE POTENTIAL LIFE EXPERIENCES ALL OF THE VICTIMS OR ALL OF THE DEFENDANT. HOW THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ARE HAS A WORKING GROUP THAT HAS BEEN PUT TOGETHER UP WITH EXPERTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS VERY PROBLEM BECAUSE I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THERE IS BIAS IN OUR COURTS THERE IS BIAS IN LIFE IN OUR CORE TO REFLECTION OF LIFE AND TO GO OUT THERE AND TO TRY IN A JURY TRIAL TO PULL OUT IMPLICIT BIAS. IS PROBABLY GOING TO ADD WEEKS TO EACH JURY TRIAL. AND AT A TIME WHEN JUSTICE IS VERY HAS VIRTUALLY COME TO A HALT. WE'RE LOOKING AT YEARS OF BACKLOG EVEN TO TRY CASES EVEN TO TRY MISDEMEANOR CASES AND I MAY BE WRONG BUT I BELIEVE IN WASHINGTON. THIS WAS APPLIED FOR. CAPITAL CASES IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN AND YET IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE BRINGING IT DOWN TO THE VERY BASIC. THE CASE FOR MISDEMEANOR TRIALS THIS IS COMPLICATED STUFF THIS IS GOING INTO OUR COURT SYSTEM AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO IDENTIFY AND ROOT OUT BIAS A VERY WORTHY CAUSE AND I COMMEND THE AUTHOR THIS BILL FOR HER PASSION AND HER COMMITMENT AND RIGHTEOUSNESS. IN THIS COST. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY DOES REQUIRE. THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL IN THE SYSTEM WHO UNDERSTAND WHO LEAVE THE SYSTEM WHO ARE TRYING TO SEE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE WORK TOGETHER IN FACT THREE YEARS AGO THE CHIEF JUSTICE CREATED A PRE TRIAL DETENTION REFORM WORK GROUP AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB CAN. REPLACING CASH BAIL. NOW WE COULD SIT HERE AND TRY TO DO THAT BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE GUTS IN THE BOOK AND THE BOLTS OF A OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT UNLESS THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE WHO HAVE BEEN PRACTICING LONG PICTURE REASON WHO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT GOES ON IN THE COURTROOM AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST IN ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW I KNOW EVERYONE'S GOING TO DO WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO BUT THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION HERE. THERE IS THE JURY SELECTION WORK GROUP. THAT HAS BEEN FORMED TO STUDY THE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BIAS IN PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES TO PROSPECTIVE JURORS. WITH MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN APPOINTED- I WOULD NOTE THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WENT NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL. THEY TOOK NO POSITION ON THIS BILL AND I THINK THAT'S A DISTINCTION THAT HAS TO BE DRAWN. BECAUSE THE COURTS FREQUENTLY SAY THIS IS NOT R. BAILEY WORK TO DECIDE POLICY. IT IS OUR- BAILEY WE'RE TO INTERPRET IT. AND SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT. THEY HAVE. AND WHAT THEY HAVE NOT. DONE WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL- THE GOAL IS TO ENSURE FAIRNESS OF JURY POOLS IN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. AND I WOULD SUBMIT. THAT IT WOULD BE MOST BENEFICIAL IT WOULD WORK TO THE BENEFIT OF EVERYONE WHO IS SEEKING. FAIRNESS AND IMPARTIALITY IN THE COURT SYSTEM TO LET THIS WORK GROUP COME UP WITH ITS RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THEN WITH THAT EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE AND COMMITMENT FOR JUSTICE WHICH I DO BELIEVE WE ARE STREET WE DO SEE IN OUR CURRENT- THE SUPREME COURT. AND JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THEN WE CAN MOVE AND DO IT RIGHT. AND DO IT WELL AND DO IT EFFECTIVELY. BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION HERE TO MAKE THAT DECISION WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE DO WE DO NOT HAVE. THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IS A VERY DELICATE ONE. IT IS A PROCESS NOT ALWAYS. A PRODUCT. BUT WE CAN MPROVE THEIR PROCESS AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. HAS SET UP TO DO. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. THAT WE NOT MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD TODAY. YOU CENTER JACKSON SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. YEAH I WASN'T GOING TO GET UP AND SPEAK A- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO MY HOMEWORK ON THIS LEGISLATION AND- SHE ATE THE COMPELLING REMARKS GIVEN- FROM THE CENTER FROM IRVINE AND SANTA BARBARA HERE I THINK THERE'S SOME COMPELLING ARGUMENTS AND TO BE HONEST I WRESTLED. MIGHTILY WITH THIS BILL- SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE CENTER FROM IRVINE RAISED- I REPRESENT SEAMY VALLEY. AND I'D BE REMISS TO PASS ANY LEGISLATION. THAT LED ANOTHER RODNEY KING VERDICT BE MORE LIKELY. IT WAS DEEPLY CONCERNING TO ME THAT IN SOME WAYS WE WOULD HAND. OUR PROSECUTORS A DIFFERENT SET OF TOOLS SAVE IN OUR PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO GET MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR- WOMEN AND OTHER PROTECTED CLASSES ON THE JURY'S IN THE COURSE OF THE DILIGENCE ON THIS LEGISLATION NOW. AND GOING THROUGH IT WHAT WHAT I REALLY LEARNED IS THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE. MAJOR IMPACT ON HOW DAZN PUBLIC DEFENDER'S DEAL WITH THEIR BOARD HEARING IN THESE CASES I DON'T THINK THE SPONSORS ARE THE AUTHOR DISPUTE THAT. BUT WHAT I EAT I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION IS THAT. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE CREATIVE THAN SIMPLY USING RACE AS A FACTOR. WHEN YOU ARE DOING THOSE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES IF YOU'RE PROSECUTING A HATE CRIME. OR IF YOU'RE PROSECUTING UNAUTHORIZED USE OF FORCE. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER REASON TO BUMP THAT JUROR OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE WHITE. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. WE SHOULDN'T BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST JURORS BECAUSE THEY'RE WHITE AND WE ASSUME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE JUST STANDING UP FOR SOMEONE WHO WOULD PERPETRATE HATE CRIME JUST LIKE WE SHOULD BE DISCRIMINATED JURORS BECAUSE THEY'RE BLACK OR THEY'RE A WOMAN. PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENTS. I THINK IT IS BILL STILL AFFORDS THOSE TOOLS OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES NOT JUST THE PROSECUTION BUT ALSO THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS NOW MIND YOU PUBLIC DEFENDERS UNDER THIS LEGISLATION ALSO WOULD BE BARRED FROM USING RACE AS A FACTOR IF THEY'RE PUSHING FORWARD OF A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE. AND THAT THAT THRESHOLD WHAT THEY CALLED THE NOBLE REVIEW THAT'LL BE SCRUTINIZED VERY CAREFULLY. I THINK THE NET RESULTS MAY VERY WELL BE- THE PRESSURE BUILDS SUCH THAT. THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE AND THAT COUNCIL THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE TODAY. AS A FIRE LIT UNDER THEM AND THAT THEY THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO HUSTLE UP. AND DO SOME WORK RIGHT NOW. I DON'T THINK WE CAN WAIT TILL TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO START MAKING JURIES MORE FAIR. I DON'T THINK WE CAN WAIT TILL TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO WORK THROUGH A SET OF GUIDELINES. I REALIZED THAT THIS BILL IS AGGRESSIVE. AND IT'S GOING TO FORCE CHANGE. BUT I'M I'M REALLY COMPELLED BY THIS MOMENT. AND REALIZING THAT THE JUDICIARY IS AN INCREDIBLY FUNCTIONAL IN CRITICAL BRANCH IS NOT BROKEN BUT IT IS OUR JOB TO STEP IN AND DECIDE THESE TOUGH POLICY QUESTIONS. WHETHER YOU'RE WHITE OR BLACK OR YOU'RE A WOMAN OR A MAN. I HAPPEN TO BE- A WHITE MAN AND I LIVE IN YOU KNOW CALABASAS. AND YET I STILL THINK THAT THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL INJUSTICES IN THIS SYSTEM. THAT HAPPENED TO PEOPLE EVERY DAY. SO WHEN YOU VOTE ON THIS MEASURE NO THAT. YOU ARE GOING TO BE CAUSING A RIPPLE EFFECT IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. DELAYS WILL PROSECUTE THEIR CASES DIFFERENTLY. AND THEY'LL STOP. AND THINK FOR A SECOND ABOUT HOW THEY'RE MAKING THAT ARGUMENT. AND THERE WILL BE A LOT OF SECOND GUESSING OF ONESELF. AND I THINK. THAT'S A GOOD THING. TO RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE HAVE IMPLICIT BIASES. AND IT TO REALLY WRESTLE WITH THAT AND TO LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER TO KNOW THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS WATCHING. TO ME IS A CRITICAL FUNCTION AT THIS SPOT. NOT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT INTERPRETS LAW. BUT THIS BODY DOES THE PEOPLE'S WILL HAS TO STEP IN AND LEAD ON. SO YOU KNOW WITH WITH THAT MUCH DILIGENCE AND- BUT TOUGH DELIBERATION PROCESS HERE I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE TODAY. AND I THINK THAT. IF THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IT DOESN'T WORK OR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL STEPS IN OR THERE IS SOME NEW SET OF GUIDELINES. SO BE IT THEY CAN STEP IN AND WE CAN AMEND THIS LAW. BUT FOR RIGHT NOW I THINK WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT YOUR AGENCY THIS MOMENT CALLS FOR IT WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.THANK YOU SENATOR AND MEMBERS WERE GONNA GO TO SENATOR MORLOCKS SENATOR MORE LIKE EUROPE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. MY WIFE RECENTLY RELATED A PROFOUND AND FUNNY QUOTE THAT SHE HAD HEARD. AND IT WENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS MANY PEOPLE ARE JUDGMENTAL I CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM. AND SO I KIND OF APPRECIATE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO PICK JURORS. YEAH I AGREE WITH THE SENATORS FROM SANTA SANTA ANA THE ORANGE COUNTY SEAT AND FROM SANTA BARBARA. JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE SENATOR FROM MALIBU THAT IRVINE IS IN MY DISTRICT DON'T WANT TO. HAVE ANY CONFUSION BUT- I BELIEVE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SHOULD FINISH THEIR WORK. AND I RECOMMEND A NO VOTE ON A. B. THIRTY SEVENTY THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCKS SENATOR HUESO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND APPRECIATE- BECAUSE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION HI I DIDN'T TEND TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL. EITHER BUT- I AM CONFLICTED ON THIS BILL AS A AS A LATINO KNOWING THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR GENERALLY OR ARE MORE APT TO BE REPRESENTED IN IN PRISON. THAN IN THE VOTING BOOTHS AND END OF CORPORATE AMERICA AND IN AREAS THAT- ARE. OF REFLECTIVE OF UNEQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO SEE YOU SUCCEED IN THIS COUNTRY. SO I WANTED TO SPEAK JUST TO EXPLAIN MY POSITION AND WHY I FEEL THIS BILL REALLY DOESN'T ADDRESS THE- I DON'T THINK EVEN AT ALL. THIS BILL DOESN'T GUARANTEE THAT A JURY HERE- INTERDIGITAL THIS PROCESS WILL BE SELECTED. THAT WILL PROVIDE A PERSON A JURY OF- THAT WILL WOULD BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITY WELL IT WOULD ADDRESS HOW ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR COULD BE DISMISSED OR NOT IT DOESN'T GET TO- REQUIRING THAT A JURY SHOULD BE MADE UP OF A JURY OF OUR PEERS AND SO IN SO MANY CASES AND THERE AE SO MANY FACTORS THAT LEAD TO JURIES BEEN SELECTED THAT ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CHIEF JUSTICE UNDERTAKING A PROGRAM THAT WILL DO A COMPREHENSIVE CHANGE TO MAKE SURE THIS HAPPENS. I THINK WE'RE LOSING AN OPPORTUNITY HERE AS A LEGISLATURE TO INFLUENCE THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS. AND TO SEND A BILL TO THE LOOK THE SUPREME COURT THAT WILL GUIDE THAT PROCESS AND HOPE THAT WE CAN. ADDRESS SEVERAL ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT BUT- TO BE ADDRESSED IN ORDER THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN. AND THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT. IDENTIFY THAT ARE RUCIAL BUT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE WE CAN GET TO A SELECTING A JURY OF OUR PEERS ONE OF FIRST OF ALL IS HOW THE JURY POOL IS SELECTED- ONLY REGISTERED VOTERS AND WE KNOW THAT WITHIN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO COMMUNITY THERE ARE A LOT OF REGISTERED THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE NOT REGISTERED TO VOTE AND THEREFORE BY PAST TO BE PROPER TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS AND WHEN YOU GO TO A JURY A LOUNGE WHERE THE POOL IS SELECTED FROM YOU ALREADY SEE THAT YOU HAVE A POPULATION TO BEGIN WITH THAT'S NOT. REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITY AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT AND ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN AMERICA HAS AS A ELIGIBLE TO BE SELECTED TO SERVE. THE OTHER ISSUE. THAT IS VERY CRITICAL. IS THAT WHEN. BELOW ARE SELECTED. FULL OF COLOUR LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS TEND TO BE IN OCCUPATIONS THAT OF PROVIDE THEM UP ON. ALL OF A VERY HARD TIME TO BE ABLE TO SERVE BECAUSE THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN LOW WAGE JOBS AND SO THEY ARE MORE APT TO SELECT FINANCIAL HARDSHIP AS A REASON NOT TO SERVE AND COOK OUR CURRENT. PROCESS DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ANY ANY PROTECTION OR OR COMPENSATION FOR A PEOPLE THAT ARE OF A VERY LOW ICOME MEANS SO ONLY REALLYIN OUR OUR CURRENT POOL WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN EITHER MIDDLE CLASS OR ABOVE MIDDLE CLASS. THERE ARE OTHER ELIGIBLE TO SERVE IN THAT ALSO NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE WORKING IN THIS AREA IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT I THINK LIKE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I THINK. OTHER AREAS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. PEOPLE THINK THAT BY ONLY TWEAKING THIS ONE AREA THAT YOU YOU'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT. AND IT COULD POSSIBLY CREATE A CHALLENGE IN CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION BY A TWEAKING THIS IN PARTICULAR MAY CREATE CHALLENGES TO. ADDRESSING OTHER ISSUES SO. WITH ITS WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I WILL I'LL STAY OFF FOR THIS MEASURE NOW AND HOPE THAT- THE CHIEF JUSTICE CAN CONVENE A PROCESS THAT WILL COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS AND MANY OF THEM MIGHT REQUIRE. LEGISLATION TO ADOPT THEM AND MAYBE WE CAN- SUPPORT A PROGRAM THAT WILL GET. MORE PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO SERVE BY BY GIVING THEM SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL COMPENSATION ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT WOULD- BE HARMED FINANCIALLY IF THEY SERVE IN OUR SYSTEM AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO ADDRESS. AND FOR THAT HI I. AM VERY SAD NOT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY I THINK YOU SENT AWAY SO SEEING NO HANDS RAISED AND A FURTHER MICROPHONES UP SENATOR WINNER PLEASE CLOSE. I THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOT A PRESIDENT AND IT'S THIS IS A GOOD ONE TO SHOW THAT EVERYONE IS STILL VERY- ALERT AFTER A LONG DAY AND PAYING ATTENTION AND ENERGIZE AND- THAT SPEAKS WELL OF OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND I WANT TO THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE FOR A VERY THOUGHTFUL. COMMENTS AND I CAN SAY THAT- AS A TRIAL ATTORNEY MYSELF WE TRIED QUITE A FEW CASES- YOU KNOW I'VE HAD MY OWN OPINIONS ABOUT JURY SELECTION OVER TIME- BUT I KNOW THE FUNDAMENTALLY THIS BILL IS ABOUT SOLVING WERE MAKING PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING A VERY REAL PROBLEM THAT WE FACE WHICH IS RACIAL BIAS IN OUR JURY SELECTION PROCESS. I WANT TO ELECT OR ELECT I WANT TO ADDRESS A FEW FACTUAL STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE ON A VISIT AS THE CENTER OF SANTA BARBARA MENTIONED SHE'S CORRECT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SENT A LETTER SAYING THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL. AND WHAT THE JUDICIAL. COUNCIL SAID AT THE END OF ITS LETTER. I WAS. I THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS NO POSITION ON A. B. THIRTY SEVEN B. AS IT BELIEVES THAT THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES OR A POLICY CALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE. WE ARE THE POLICY MAKING BODY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE SET THE RULES AND THE COURTS APPLY THOSE RULES. AND I DON'T THINK IT IS A SOUND ARGUMENT O SAY THAT FOR SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS FUNDAMENTAL THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A FAIR JURY AND THE JURY SELECTION SHOULD NOT BE RACIALLY BIASED. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT JUST WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS A- THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CAME FORWARD WITH DOZENS OF AMENDMENTS. THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL IN THE AUTHORS SPEND WEEKS WORKING WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND TOOK AMENDMENTS THEY PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN. THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION PROVIDED NUMEROUS AMENDMENTS AND ALL OF THOSE AMENDMENTS EXCEPT FOR ONE WERE TAKEN. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN JUDGES ISSUED A NEGATIVE LETTER AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY WITHDREW THAT LETTER. THIS BILL THE IMPLEMENTATION WAS DELAYED UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO WAS ORIGINALLY JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THE REASON IT WAS DELAYED WAS BECAUSE THE JUDGES CAME FORWARD AND SAID WE HAVE SOME TRAINING TO DO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IMPLEMENT IT WELL AND SO THE AUTHOR DR WEBBER AGREED TO A ONE YEAR DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION AT THE REQUEST OF THE JUDGES SO THAT THEY COULD BE PROPERLY TRAINED AND THAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE DECISION. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT MEANS THAT WELL LET'S NOT GO INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO ANYWAY SO DON'T DO THE BILL I JUST DON'T AGREE. WITH THAT WASHINGTON STATE AND THE SENATOR FROM ORANGE COUNTY MENTIONED THE WASHINGTON STATE- GENERAL THIRTY SEVEN. AND I. WILL NOT IT'S NOT IDENTICAL TO THIRTY SEVENTY BUT IT HAS MANY OF THE SAME DOCTORS. TALKING ABOUT- WITH THAT JUROR IS INATTENTIVE OR HAS A BAD ATTITUDE. SO THAT'S MY REAL JUSTIFICATION. FOR STRIKING. JUROR ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE IN GENERAL RULE THIRTY SEVEN FROM WASHINGTON STATE. WE GOT A LETTER. FROM JUSTICE GONZALEZ FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON AND JUST AS YOU DO. ON A BASICALLY THANKING CALIFORNIA FOR REACHING OUT. AND IT ENDS BY SAYING WE HOPE OTHER STATES WILL JOIN OUR EFFORTS IN ADDRESSING BIAS IN JURY SELECTION. AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT YOUR WORK THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS LETTER THAT WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN POSITIVE ABOUT THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA. WAS GOING TO BE JOINING WASHINGTON STATE AND TAKING AGGRESSIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND THE SELECTION. OF JURIES. WELL WE HEARD A NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS TODAY COLLEAGUES THAT WE SHOULD DELAY THIS. WHICH ARE THE LATEST FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS AND I BET YOU CAN WANDER AROUND THIS ROOM EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU COLLEAGUE HAS HEARD THAT ABOUT ONE OR MANY OF YOUR BILLS. WE SHOULD ESTABLISH A WORKING GROUP. BEFORE WE DO YOUR BILL. WE HAVE TO HAVE A COMPLETELY COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION THAT SOLVES EVERYTHING OR WE CAN SOLVE ONE PIECE OF IT. WHEN WE KNOW THAT IT IS SO RARE THAT WE WOULD EVER HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION IT'S THE WAY OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS YOU SOLVE PIECES OF A PROBLEM UNTIL YOU SAW. THE WHOLE THING. ON THAT WE SHOULD AND FROM THREE CHALLENGES AND I AGREE WITH THE CENTER OF OUR COUNTY THERE'S A GOOD ARGUMENT FOR DOING THAT AND THAT'S A BILL THAT I WOULD BE OPEN TO SUPPORTING. I DON'T RECALL THAT BILL. BEING PROPOSED WHAT I DO RECALL IS THAT THE SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA. INTRODUCED A BILL THAT I SUPPORTED THAT REDUCED. OR EXTENDED THE REDUCTION OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. THAT BILL WAS WORLD WAR THREE. AND IF WE WERE TO HAVE A BILL TO AND FROM THREE CHALLENGES MY CONFIDENCE LEVEL THAT THAT BILL WOULD PASS IS SOMETHING CLOSE TO ZERO BECAUSE EVERYONE ALL SIDES OF THE BAR WILL COME OUT FULL GUNS BLAZING BECAUSE THEY ALL LOVE TO HAVE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU CAN GET RID OF THE PEOPLE YOU DON'T LIKE EVEN IF YOU HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS EVEN IF YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT THE REASON YOU'RE STRIKING SOMEONE IS BECAUSE OF RACE AND THAT'S WHY THE PART OF THIS BILL THAT SAYS IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR SUBJECTIVE INTENT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A BAD PERSON FOR THE PEREMPTORY TO BE RACIALLY BIASED IT SAYS HAS TO BE THAT WAY OBJECTIVELY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU WERE BEING MALICIOUS. I'M CONCERNED BASED ON THE DEBATE TODAY BUT WHAT WE WILL SEE IF THIS BILL WAS REJECTED IT'S UNCLEAR THAT ANYTHING WILL HAPPEN. I HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE CHIEF JUSTICE IS WORKING WITHOUT A CRITICISM I LOVE IT SHE JUST SAYS WHAT THE GUY WHO I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT AGAIN. THEY ARE NOT THE LEGISLATURE. SO THIS IS A REAL ISSUE RIGHT NOW. COLLEGE THIS IS NOT LIKE A NEW PROBLEM THAT'S ARISEN AND WE HAVE TO LIKE STEP BACK. AND DO A WORKING GROUP.

AND HE PURSUED THAT DREAM IN ORDER TO JOIN THE POLICE FORCE AND THEN SERVING THE NEWMAN POLICE DEPARTMENT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LOSS JUST TO NAME INCREASED FROM IT'S A VERY VERY SMALL DEPARTMENT SO THEY WEREN'T JUST COLLEAGUES- PASSERS BY I MEAN MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE NAME AND POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE LIKE BROTHERS AND SISTERS. BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A SMALL DEPARTMENT WENT TO THE FUNERAL OF CORPORATE DEAL SEEN. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OR THEIR OVERFLOW TO THE BALCONY IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT ROOMS LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM ALL OVER AT THE CANADIAN MOUNTIES- IT WAS JUST SET A FITTING TRIBUTE I GUESS YOU'D SAY FOR SOMEONE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES SO YOUNG. CORPORATE ELSE SEEN IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW- THE INDIAN AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAVE THAT SERVE IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HE WAS VERY VERY DEDICATED AND I WOULD ALSO AGAIN THIS IS- LIKE TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT CORPORAL MISSING DIDN'T HAVE TO DIE. WHEN HE DID A ROUTINE TRAFFIC STOP- FOR A. D. Y. HE CAME UPON AN INDIVIDUAL WHO. IS IN THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. HE CAME UPON AN END OF THE WHO HAD A- POSSESSION. AND HAD BEEN DRINKING A DRIVING AND THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOT AND KILLED CORPORAL SCENE. SO TOO I DEDICATE THIS STRETCH OF HIGHWAY.

ASSEMBLY BILL THREE ZERO ZERO FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROBERT RIVAS AND ACTUALLY ADDING TO THE LEROY ANDERSON DAM AND RESERVOIR AND DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE OF SICK AFFECT IMMEDIATELY. REMINDING THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING. THE GOOD SENATOR FROM CALABASAS IN HIS STAFF IN NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS. SUPPORT AND WORK ON THIS A. B. THREE ZERO ZERO FIVE WHICH WILL RESOLVE THE MAJOR DISTRICT IF YOU AN ISSUE THAT HAS REGIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY AND WATER SUPPLY IMPACTS AND IMPLICATIONS. THIS LEGISLATION SEEKS TO ENACT CHANGES IN STATE LAW CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED THIS YEAR TO STREAMLINE NECESSARY SEISMIC RETROFITS FOR THE LEROY ANDERSON DAM BY THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT THAT WILL DO THE FOLLOWING IT WILL REQUIRE EXPEDITED PERMITTING BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. WITH ASSOCIATED COSTS COVERED BY VALLEY WATER THE BILL WILL AUTHORIZE BEST VALUE CONTRACTING AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW FOR SEQUEL pVALLEY WATER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUBSTANTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS INCLUDING REQUIRING THE PROJECT TO DELIVER NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE ANDERSON DAM WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY IT WAS BUILT TO THE SAFETY STANDARDS OF THAT TIME BUT AS WE NOW KNOW THE DAM WAS CONSTRUCTED ALONG TO EARTHQUAKE FAULT LINES IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE A BREACH OF THE DAM AT FULL CAPACITY WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC. IN THAT SCENARIO IT'S PREDICTED THAT FROM THE SITE OF THE DAM FLOODING WOULD EXTEND TO MORE THAN FORTY MILES FLOODING OVER A HALF DOZEN CITIES AND TOWNS SUBMERGING THE MAJOR TECH CENTERS OF THE SILICON VALLEY THE DRIVE SO MUCH OF OUR ECONOMY. AND HIGHLY DENSE POPULATED AREAS NEAR MORGAN HILL THIS URGENCY BILL SEEKS TO EXPEDITE PERMITTING IN CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE CONSTRUCTION IMPROVEMENTS AT ANDERSON DAM CREATING OVER. FIVE THOUSAND WELL PAID JOBS IN THE PROCESS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I VOTED ON THIS URGENT BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN A THE DESCRIPTION OF CENTER NELSON. THIS PRESENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE I ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT THIS. EXPEDITED REVIEW BUILT. IT'S A VERY CRITICAL. NEED TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE. OUR DAMS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT CERTAINLY CAME TO MY ATTENTION WHEN THE ORVILLE SPELL AWAY HAD A FAILURE. NOW THAT IS A VERY LARGE DAM IT'S C. HEART OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. BUT WHAT WE DID LEARN IS OVER THE DECADES. NOT NEAR ENOUGH ATTENTION HAD BEEN PAID. THAT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR AND SUSTAINING THE SITE. NOW IN OUR PART WE DID NOT HAVE. THE CONCERN OF THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT. BUT THAT IS A HUGE THERE. AND WHEN THESE DAMS ARE COMPROMISED. THE FAILURE CAN BE DEVASTATING. A GOOD FRIEND THE AUTHOR FROM THERE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT THAT IMPACT WOULD BE HOW FAR THAT WATER WOULD GO HOW DESTRUCTIVE IT WOULD LEAD TO THE ECONOMY OF THAT VERY HEALTHY REGION. AND ALSO THE LIVES. THAT COULD BE COMPROMISED. OR WILL HAPPEN WE HAD TO EVACUATE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE. THIS WOULD NOT REQUIRE SUCH BUT LET'S NOT GET TO THAT POINT. THE POINT IS DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. OVER DAMS AND THERE IS A DEGREE STATUTE DAM INSPECTION SYSTEMS THAT ARE ON STATE. BUT. FOR WHAT MANY REASONS. SOME THE INSPECTION SOMETIMES THE REPAIRS FOUND IN THOSE INSPECTIONS. HAS BEEN NEGLECTED HERE I THINK IT'S BEEN PRETTY WELL DETERMINE WHAT NOW NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND THEREFORE WE MUST GET A BALLOT. FOR THOSE OF YOU IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. WE COULDN'T ARGUE MUCH THAT THE STATE WATER PROJECT IN OUR BILL DOES NOT AFFECT YOU. DOES IT DOES AFFECT MOST OF THE STATE. THIS IS MORE LOCALIZED BUT OF NO LESS SIGNIFICANT. TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE. WHO INHABIT THAT AREA. AND BENEFIT FROM THE DROP WATER DERIVING FROM THAT CRITICAL DAM. I DON'T VIEW THIS IS COMPROMISING ANY THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPERATIVES. BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES BALANCE THOSE WITH. THE PUBLIC SAFETY IMPERATIVES THE NEED OF THE CITIZENS FOR THE WATER WHATEVER THE USE IS AN ABSOLUTE CRITICAL NEED TO PROTECT THEM FROM A FAILURE OF THAT. SO IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR OWN AREA DON'T JUST SAY WELL THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM. IT REALLY ISN'T. THE WATER IS NEEDED THE STATE COULD HAVE NEVER GROWN. WITHOUT THE IMPOUNDMENT OF WATER. AROUND CALIFORNIA AND WE WOULD HAVE HAD MANY JONESTOWN FLOODS. OVER THE DECADES AND IN FACT IN EARLIEST TIMES. MOST OF THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN VALLEYS WERE UNDER WATER. RADIANLAND SEIZED THE TELLER LIKE BASIN BEING ANOTHER ONE. I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS AREA BUT I DO KNOW HOW VALUABLE THE WATER IS TO THEM. AND I ASKED YOU TO SUPPORT THE BILL TO BE OF ASSISTANCE TO THE CITIZENS DOWN THERE TO EXPEDITE THE PROJECT YOU'RE NOT JUST HELPING THEM. YOU'RE HELPING YOUR WHOLE STATE GINGIVAL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SHINO HANSON MARKS APPEAR NO HANDS REMOTELY.

SENATOR WIENER I THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE TO PRESENT AV EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE ON BEHALF OF NUMBER THERE'S THREE OF US- ABC FORTY FIVE SIX TO CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND COMMUNICATION THAT IS REQUIRED NOW MORE THAN EVER. BY ESTABLISHING A SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT ON HOMELESSNESS AT THE STATE LEVEL A STATE OFFICE TO END HOMELESSNESS. THROUGH TO THE STATE FLAG OF A CENTRALIZED OFFICE ON HOMELESSNESS. OUR RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS HAS BEEN UNNECESSARILY FRAGMENTED BECAUSE OF THIS WE'VE HAD DIFFICULTY ACHIEVING CLEAR DATA ON OUR HOMELESS. HOMELESSNESS EVERY STATEWIDE SORT OF TRACKING HOMELESSNESS RELATED EXPENDITURES ASSESSING WHICH PROGRAMS ARE WORKING WELL- AND- DETERMINING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BETTER. THE STORE WILL BE A CRUCIAL STEP TO HELP THE STATE RESPOND TO OUR HOMELESS CRISIS. AND RESPECT WELLS FROM RIVAL. THANK YOU SIR WINNERS OUR DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE. SEEING NO MICROPHONES UP ON THE FLOOR SEEING NO HANDS UP- LOOKS. ALL RIGHT US SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. OKAY ALAN. FIVE ARCHULETA I. ACTUALLY I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO BUY WITH A BACKUP CENTER BOARD YES POLITICS I DO NOT SEE YOUR HAND UP EARLIER.

YEAH YES SIR PLEASE CONTINUE CENTER BORDERS. THANK YOU I'M MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE GOVERNOR ALREADY HAD THROUGH A TASK FORCE ESSENTIALLY- EIGHTY POINT PERSON THAT WOULD BE CHARGED WITH THE OFFICE TO END HOMELESSNESS CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT OR WAS THAT NOT. FULLY FUNCTIONING. THROUGH THE THROUGH THE OUR PRESIDENT ON. SERVING AS THE GOVERNOR HAS ADVISERS IN PEOPLE HERE POINTS TO ADVISE HIM AND POLICY- THIS IS CREATING A MORE FORMALIZED A STRUCTURE BECAUSE WHAT THE GOVERNOR DID AND I'M NOT DISPARAGING AND ANYWAY- WAS TO DESIGNATE PEOPLE TO PROVIDE ADVICE TO HIM ON HOMELESSNESS POLICY THIS IS ACTUALLY CREATING A MORE CENTRALIZED- OFFICE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY FRAGMENTED. IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND FRANKLY WE'VE NEVER HAD THE KIND OF A CENTRALIZED RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS THAT WE NEED. THE RESEARCH THANK YOU THE REASON I ASK IS THIS. THIS SEEMS TO BE AN EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND I'M WONDERING IF WE'RE OVERSTEPPING OURSELVES BY FORCIBLY CREATING. AN EXECUTIVE POSITION FIVE WE KNOW WHERE THE GOVERNOR STANDS ON THIS I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE GOVERNOR STANDS AS I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE STANDS ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF BILLS- BUT I WILL SAY THAT- THE LEGISLATURE- WE WERE LEGISLATING CRADLES THE AGENCIES OF STATE GOVERNMENT ALL CREATED. TYPICALLY BY LEGISLATION- BY THE LEGISLATURE WE CREATE EXECUTIVE AGENCIES AND THEN WE MAKE POLICY AND THE GOVERNOR AND HIS AGENCY'S EXECUTE THE POLICY. ALSO ABSOLUTELY INAPPROPRIATE LEGISLATIVE ENDEAVOR. TO CREATE A NEW EXECUTIVE OFFICE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR BARGES CENTER MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO STAND UP BRIEFLY IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE IT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN I CARRIED AND PASSED THE LEGISLATION SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THAT CREATED THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL IT WAS BASED ON A MODEL AND A NUMBER OF STATES. AT THAT POINT UNDER THE AT THE REQUEST OF THE N. PROTEIN KEVIN DE LEON I LET THE SENATE DELEGATION TO UTAH TO LOOK AT THEIR HOUSING HOMELESS COORDINATING COUNCIL ONLY MODEL THAT BASED ON THAT. AND SO OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS WE'VE SEEN WHAT WORKS IN CALIFORNIA WHAT DOES IT AND SO. THE FURTHER THE ROLE OF THE COUNCIL TO REALLY COORDINATE MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS IMPACTING HOMELESSNESS. AND TO ELEVATE THE COUNCIL SO IT'S LED BY SECRETARY THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS BILL BASED ON THAT HISTORY- AND OUR COLLECTIVE COMMITMENT AND UNDERSTANDING THAT. HOMELESSNESS REALLY IS A STATEWIDE ISSUE THAT SHOULD REQUIRE EXECUTIVE LEVEL ATTENTION. THE ELEVATION THE COORDINATING COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. OF THE AND THE APPOINTMENT OF THE SECRETARY WILL DO JUST THAT SO I'M PROUD TO LEND SUPPORT. THIS FAMILY MEMBER IN HER BILL. THANK YOU SIR MITCHELL SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU SIR I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND FRANKLY IT IT'S LONG OVERDUE- THE FINANCE CENTER FROM WESTCHESTER TALKED ABOUT HER LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS FOR YEARS AGO- I BELIEVE WAS THE FOLLOWING YEAR MYSELF INTO SOME IN WACKY WAS ABLE TO GET APPROVED A REQUEST BY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE LHASA WHICH IS THE AGENCY THAT APPROVES THAT DISTRIBUTES. ALMOST FINDS IN LA COUNTY. OR TO BE THE NORTHERN L. COUNTY WAS NOT GETTING ITS FAIR SHARE FUNDS AND LOCAL HOLD WHEN THE STATE AUDITOR WINNIE AND- DISCOVER THAT WAS TRUE AND FORTUNATELY THE CHANGE- FORMULA SO NOT EVERYBODY GETS. THE MONEY THAT THEY- I SHOULD GET. BUT IN IN THAT A LOT OF REQUESTS WE ASKED. DOES STATE AUDITOR TO COME UP WITH BEST PRACTICES. AND WHEN SHE'S DONE WITH THE AUDIT- MISSILE CALLED-ME AND WAS HORRIFIED. THAT THIS STATE IS SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON HOMELESSNESS AND THERE'S NO PLAN. SO I- I TOOK THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AUDITOR AND RUN THAT KILLED TWICE. TWICE SAID BILL IS BEEN HELD UP IN THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. SO MAYBE THAT PERSON DOESN'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT HOMELESSNESS I DON'T KNOW BUT THIS ISSUE I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS A SCOURGE ON OUR SOCIETY- AND WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS IT IN THIS IS A POSITIVE STEP FORWARD I WISH IT'D HAPPEN SOONER. BUT IT'S HAPPENING NOW. I STRONGLY RECOMMENDED I GO. THANK YOU SENATOR WILK A CENTER GROVE I SAW YOUR HAND UP. BUT THEN IT WENT DOWN AND UP AGAIN SO IT'S ONE CONFIRM DID YOU WANT TO DRESS THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR SPEAKER I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY- I JUST WANTED TO I WASN'T GOING TO COMMENT UNTIL I HEARD SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES AND YOU KNOW IT IS TRUE REESE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ALLOCATED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HOMELESSNESS AND WE'RE STILL- HOMELESS LIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- POLICIES THAT ARE PASSED BY THIS BODY THAT CREATES A HIGHER COST OF HOUSING. AND JOBS THAT ARE BEING ELIMINATED- ANY INDIVIDUALS BEING RELEASED FROM PRISON WITH NO PLACE TO GO- ARE CREATING A LARGER HOMELESS POPULATION THAN WE EVER POSSIBLY IMAGINED WHEN I DRIVE FROM WHERE I LIVE AT HERE AT THE CAPITOL TO THAT CAPITAL OFFICE I PASS- SEVERAL HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS SOME OF THEM- IN THAT SEVERAL HUNDREDS- IS SEVERAL CITY BLOCKS OF HOMELESSNESS WHEN I CAME DOWN TWELVE STREET AND- SO. I MEAN. YOU KNOW WE'LL TRY THIS TO BED YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE HOW CREATING A SECRETARY POSITION AFTER WE ALREADY SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN HOMELESSNESS AND THE- THE MATTER HAS GOTTEN EXTEND YOU AND LEAVE YOU KNOW X. IT JUST COMPLETELY WORSE. THAN EVER- DID IT EVER WAS BEFORE- MY OTHER COLLEAGUE- SAID THAT SHE HAD BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR FOUR YEARS- IN FOUR YEARS IT'S GOTTEN WORSE THAN IT EVER HAS THIS IS THE LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION YOU'VE EVER HAD. SPECIFICALLY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHERE THEY HAVE- OUTBREAKS OF DISEASES LIKE THE THIRD A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. SO I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW A NEW SECRETARY POSITION IN A NEW OFFICE AND A NEW GOVERNMENT. IS GOING TO HELP THE SITUATION LIKE THEM I BELIEVE IT WAS PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN SAID THAT- THE WORST THING THAT YOU CAN HEAR IS I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HERE TO HELP YOU. BECAUSE IT HAS DEFINITELY NOT HELPED THE HOMELESS POPULATION SINCE THEM. WE'VE BEEN. PUTTING FORTH POLICY. AND MAYBE. THIS WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WE'LL SEE. THANK YOU SIR GROSS DOLLAR. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I TOO ALSO. WHAT A COMMENT I I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS- WE WERE SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON WE HAVE THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE IN THE NATION AND- YOU KNOW SOMETHING NEED TO BE DONE AND I MENTIONED EARLIER. ON CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE NEED TO PLAN A QUITE FRANKLY WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN THE PLAN IS JUST KEEP PUTTING MORE MONEY TO I'M I'M ASSUMING THAT THIS POSITION WILL THEN COORDINATE A PLAN I WOULD BE BIRD **** AT TO SEE WHAT THIS WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS HERE. AGAIN HELLO YOU HAVE TO PLAN THINGS IN THE RIGHT WAY WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT AND HOME THIS IS NOT GOING AWAY IT'S NOT GETTING LESS. FRANKLY IT'S GETTING WORSE AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL- AND I'M HOPEFUL AND I WILL BE WATCHING OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS ASSUMING I'M REELECTED IN NOVEMBER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PLAN AND THAT THE MONEY THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO. HELP THOSE HOMELESS PEOPLE GET THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER THERE'S A AS WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL THAT THERE ARE MANY- THINGS THAT CAUSE HOMELESSNESS IT'S MENTAL HEALTH IT'S ADDICTION- I'M TRYING TO FIND A JOB AND HOUSING THERE'S A READERS IT'S- LOCKED AND THERE'S ALSO A NOT A GOOD ACCOUNTING SYSTEM TO FIND OUT WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE WHO THEY ARE. AND I THINK THEY GET COUNTED TWICE I THINK SOME- DON'T GET COUNTED AND THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPEFUL THAT THIS- POSITION WILL- BRING ALL THOSE FUNDS TOGETHER AND SOMEBODY WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RESOURCES WE ARE SPENDING. AS AS ALL OF YOU RECALL WE GAVE MONEY TO CITIES IN CANADA DID YOU GET THE MONEY OUT AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE THIS POSITION WILL DO SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TONIGHT IN HOPES AND ALSO WATCHING. ALONG THE NEXT FOUR YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES WHAT. WE ALL WANTED TO DO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DALIAN OTHER DAY. SAYING NONE- SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE- HELP.

THANK YOU- SIR WINTER PLACE ISABEL ON CALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON NOW TO FILE ITEM NUMBER NINETY FOUR CENT REQUIRE PREPARED TO PRESENT SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL THREE TWENTY THREE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLANCA RUBIO AN ACT RELATING TO NEWSPAPERS THANK YOU SAM MAGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MR PRESIDENT IN GOOD EATING AGAIN THAT IS IN GENERAL THE SENATE AND I'M HONORED TO BE A RISE. IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE ON BEHALF OF A SOMETHING WOMAN RUBIO WHO'S BEEN WORKING PASSIONATELY ON THIS ISSUE. NEWSPAPERS ARE ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF OUR DEMOCRACY. ANY ECONOMIC FALLOUT FROM THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN DEVASTATING TO THE INDUSTRY. CALIFORNIA'S NEWSPAPERS HELP HOLD OUR GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE THEY TELL THE UNIQUE STORIES OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE ALL LOVE. NEWSPAPERS THEY INFORMED THEY INFORM THE PEOPLE OF IMPORTANT EVENTS THAT SHAPE OUR STATE AND OUR NATION. NEWSPAPERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY IN SMALL COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS WELL THEY'RE AT RISK IN JUST THIS YEAR ALONE DUE TO THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT OF THE CORONAVIRUS. FIFTEEN NEWS PUBLICATIONS HAVE NOW CEASED OPERATIONS RIGHT HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE AND MANY MORE ARE ON THE BRINK. COMMUNITIES WITHOUT NEWSPAPERS LOSE TOUCH WITH GOVERNMENT THEY DON'T KEEP IN TOUCH WITH BUSINESS OR EDUCATION OR EVEN OUR NEIGHBORS. AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE ONE YEAR EXEMPTION FOR NEWSPAPER CARRIERS LAST YEAR WE WOULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED WE'D BE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE PANDEMIC INDUCED RECESSION ONLY TWELVE MONTHS LATER. AND NEITHER COULD- COMMUNITY PAPERS. THAT HAVE WORKED VIGOROUSLY TO IMPLEMENT EIGHTY FIVE. MAYBE THREE TWENTY THREE WILL PROVIDE NEWSPAPERS AN ADDITIONAL YEAR TO COMPLY WITH EIGHTY FIVE UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE EXTENSION DOES NOT ALLOW THE NEWSPAPERS TO BE ABLE TO ESCAPE THE CURRENT LIABILITY RESPONSIBILITY TO DELIVERY DRIVERS UNDER UNDER THE BRELO STANDARD. THE EXTENSION OF THE SUNSET DATE FOR THE EXEMPTION FOR NEWSPAPER CARRIERS WILL GIVE ETHNIC COMMUNITY IN DAILY NEWSPAPERS THE DIGITAL TIME THEY NEED TO BE TO WORK THROUGH THE COMPLICATED ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH CONVERTING. CARRIERS TO EMPLOYEES WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF ALL INTERESTED PARTIES. THROUGHOUT THE GOLDEN STATE COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS AND ETHNIC NEWS PLAY A HUGE ROLE A HUGE ROLE IN COVERING LOCAL POLITICS THEREBY INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AND IMPROVING THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN WE NEED THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER. EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE IS CRITICAL TO THE FUTURE OF THIS INDUSTRY IT'S PROBLEM POLICE IN THE COMMUNITIES AGAIN THAT WE ALL LOVE TO CALL HOME THE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE. THANK YOU SIR I REQUIRE AS THEIR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. C. CENTERED. OUR GROWTH. WE ARE VERY. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST LAST YEAR THAT- MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES AND I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO HELP- STOPPED AND DEVASTATING EFFECTS THAT EIGHTY FIVE THE EIGHTY FIVE- PRESENTED AMONG THEM WE INTRODUCE A MINUTE FOR NOT ONLY THE NEWSPAPER DELIVERY PEOPLE IN THE NEWSPAPER REPORTERS BUT ALSO AN EXEMPTION FOR MY MUSICIANS AND OTHERS WE ALSO INTRODUCED AN AMENDMENT TO HELP JOURNALISTS- IN THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY'S WE INTRODUCED AN AMENDMENT TO HELP SUPPORT COACHES TO AVOID THE BACKLASH OF EIGHTY FIVE A WEEK FOR A WHILE. I MEAN CREDIBLY PLEASED AT THE EFFORTS AND TO INCLUDE SOME OF THESE INDUSTRIES IN- LEGISLATION IS MOVING FORWARD AND SPECIFICALLY THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY THAT IS JUST ASKED- IN PRACTICALLY BEGGED. THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY TO COME FORTH AND ADDRESS THE DEBT. TO WITH FIVE AND WHY ON EARTH IN A PANDEMIC WOULD WE AS LEGISLATORS NOT ALLOWED ANYBODY TO BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR SO THAT THEY COULD PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE. YOU KNOW ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE COMMITTEE REFERRED TO EVERYBODY BEING UPSET BECAUSE- WE TOOK THEIR LOLLI POPS PER SE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT WASN'T THERE LOLLI POPS THEY WERE UPSET ABOUT. IT WAS ABOUT THE WAY THAT THEY SAID THEIR FAMILY WAS AWAKE ABOUT. THE WAY THEY MAKE YOUR CAR PAYMENT. THESE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND- HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES EVEN IN A PANDEMIC THEY WERE STILL MAKING MONEY SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILY. AND A FACEBOOK POST FROM ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS AS A SINGLE FATHER COULD BE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ONE NIGHT ON AN OFF NIGHT VISITATION WHERE HIS KIDS WERE GOING. TO SEE IS MOM THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK THAT HE GETS ADD SUBSTANTIALLY TO HIS- HIS SAMETIME SO EIGHTY FIVE IN THIS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BILL IS A COMPLETE DISASTER. SO I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WE'RE FINALLY THAT YOU GUYS ARE FINALLY SEEN THE LIGHT AND CORRECTING A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON WITH EIGHTY FIVE. AND SO I HAD THE SUPPORT THIS BILL AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE MERCH AND BILLS TO CORRECT THAT DEVASTATING BILL THAT WAS PASSED BY DEMOCRATS. SUPPORT JUST LAST YEAR. THANK YOU SIR GROSS AND HURTS FOR. THERE BRIEFLY I WANT TO MY COM WITH- THE GOOD SENATOR FROM REPRESENTING THE WHOLE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I GET SO MANY CITIES I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT FROM THEM. THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE TO THE TOPIC CALIFORNIA BUT I. JUST WANT TO ADD THE FOLLOWING. YOU KNOW. AS WE DEBATE ISSUES IN THIS GOVERNMENT. OFTEN THE SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT ONES ARE THOSE WHERE THERE'S VRY CLOSE COMPETING INTERESTS THINGS WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. AND AS WE FACE THIS ELEMENT OF DEMOCRACY WHERE WE HAVE INTERNAL A. EIGHT D. JOURNALISM WITH INTEGRITY VERSUS WHAT WE'RE FACED WITH IN THE INTERNET. SEEMS TO ME IN THE BALANCE OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP THESE. TWO FORMS OF COMMUNICATIONS THAT HAVE JOURNALISTIC INTEGRITY ALIVE AND SO FOR THAT I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT AND WORKING HARD. ON BEHALF OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU SIR HURTS BURKE CENTER PORCHES. IT'S HARD NOT TO BE A LITTLE CYNICAL. AS THIS MATTER HAS RESURRECTED BASED ON THE EXTENSIVE DEBATE THAT WE EXPERIENCED LAST SESSION. I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THE EXAM ONE OF THE EXTENSIONS. IS LIMITED LARGELY TO PRESS AND COMMUNICATION OUTLETS THOSE THAT HAVE THE POWER TO FORM OPINIONS. THOSE THAT HAVE THE POWER TO CALL OUT. FOR POLICY BUT ACROSS THE BOARD WHETHER IT BE CONVENIENCE DRIVERS WHETHER IT BEING MUSICIANS WHETHER ME HAIR SALON STYLIST SO AND SO FORTH THOSE INDIVIDUALS DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE WITH PRESTON'S. AND WHILE I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE IT FRANKLY NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED THIS IS JUST A BANDAID. UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES THE BABY FIVE. ONLY MANIFESTED IN THEIR TRUEST FORMS AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE NEEDED TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN THE WORKFORCE COLEEN HAS TAUGHT US. HOW DESPERATE TIMES CAN GET ANY HELP AT ALL YOUR MOVIES PART TIME- CELL DELINEATING SIDE JOBS OR TWO PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR FAMILIES. SO I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BUT WHETHER IT IS THAT LAUNDRY LIST THAT WE WENT THROUGH LAST CYCLE THE WAR MORE DISCREET ISSUES LIKE THIS. AP FILE HAS PROVEN. TO BE POOR POLICY I THINK THERE IS A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT IT COULD BE IMPROVED UPON WITHOUT JUMPING INTO ART A SWEEPING. SET OF CLASSIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR IN GIVING A PREFERENCE TO THE FORMER SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE KIND OF HAVING A YOU KNOW. CHICKENS COMING HOME TO ROOST MOMENT. AND I THINK IT'S SAD BECAUSE IT'S A TESTAMENT THAT WE JUMPED THE GUN LAST CYCLE AND WE'RE PAYING THE PRICE NOW. THANK YOU SIR FOR JUST A CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- WHAT TALKED ABOUT A. B. THREE TWO THREE BUT. THIS LAST YEAR HAS BEEN PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR A LOT OF US IS. LEGISLATORS HAVING TO TAKE PHONE CALLS- TAKE MEETINGS- TAKE. GOOD BYE LETTERS FROM BUSINESSES- AT ONE PUBLISHER THAT JUST ACTUALLY LEFT ORANGE COUNTY MOVED TO ARIZONA OVER EIGHTY FIVE. EIGHTY FIVE WAS A LOUSY INCOME TAX LAW AND THE TIMING COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE. CARVE OUTS. ONLY PROVE THAT EIGHTY FIVE IS POORLY CONSTRUCTED LEGISLATION. I'LL RELUCTANTLY VOTE FOR A. B. THREE TWO THREE BUT- AS THE SENATOR FROM PRESIDENT POINTED OUT. THE LINE OF OTHER INDUSTRIES WANTING A CAR ABOUT NEEDS OUR ATTENTION AS WELL BUT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO PURCHASE INK BY THE BARREL. TAKING JOURNALISM TO ITS PROVERBIAL NEEDS. THROUGH AB FIVE SHOULD MAKE OUR BODY THE MORE DELIBERATIVE ABOUT CHANGING SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT REALLY BROKEN DYNAMAX WAS BROKEN. BUT NOT THE WHOLE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR VERSUS COMMON LAW EMPLOYEE ISSUE THAT WAS ALREADY BEING DEALT WITH RATHER SATISFACTORY BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. SO WITH THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL IN THE FUTURE WITH BROAD BRUSHES. WHICH ARE DANGEROUS AND PERHAPS RECKLESS THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SIR MARK I JUST TO WANT TO RESPECTFULLY REMIND PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON THE ACTUAL MATTER HAND WHICH IS EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE- SETTER. UPDATES YOUR NETFLIX MISTER PRESIDENT YES SIR MORE LIKE YES I COULD YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOUR CLARIFICATION BUT WE WOULDN'T HAVE A. B. THREE TWO THREE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE MAYBE FIVE. SO THERE ARE THERE RELATED CHOICE IT I DON'T I DON'T APPRECIATE THAT KIND OF A- REBUKE I JUST WANNA PUT ON THE RECORD THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT THANK YOU SIR MORE LOCK- CENTER BATES. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I DO HAVE A LOT OF MEN INSIDE AT THE DESK. ALL RIGHT CENTER BATES. AND YOU HAVE AMENDMENTS AT THE DESK- SECRETARY DO YOU READ THE SET OF AMENDMENTS.

YES THESE SHOULD BE FOR THE NEWSPAPER CARRIERS AND- I JUST LIKE TO SAY WHY WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC NOW MORE THAN EVER WE DO RELY ON OUR LOCAL JOURNALISM AND I BELIEVE THAT THE- FLOOR- THAT WAS MENTIONED ON THE FLOOR WE BEGAN. THAT FOR DECADES- WE'VE HAD A DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT IS ENSURING THAT WE GOT THAT NEWS DELIVERED TO. OUR FRONT DOOR SAYING I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE WITHOUT THAT. SO AB THREE TWO THREE SIX SIX AND THE EXEMPTION DATE FOR NEWSPAPER DISTRIBUTORS AND CARRIERS TO JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

THE EYES ARE TWENTY FIVE WINDOWS OR TEN THE MOTION IS PASSED TO LAY THEM AND IT'S ON THE TABLE. LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO CENTRE DOLLY BACK TO THE TO THE BILL ITSELF. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I ALSO WANT TO. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE- FROM THE NORTH IT WHEN YOU REPRESENT VERY SMALL RURAL COUNTIES AS A- SENATOR FROM THE SECOND SENATE DISTRICT MYSELF DO. PAPERS ARE ONE OF THE ONLY- AVENUES FOR GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AS HE EXPLAINED IT VERY ELOQUENTLY- AND ALL THOSE PLACES DON'T HAVE THE- INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BROADBAND AND THE LIKES TO EVEN GET A GOOD CELL SERVICE WHERE WE CAN. BE ABLE TO. GET GOOD INFORMATION INTO THAT AND THE NORTHERN PART OF STATE FOR SURE. SO I STAND IN SUPPORT OF A. B. THREE TWO THREE ALSO WANT TO SHARE THAT. YOU KNOW THIS IS KIND OF AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY WHERE PEOPLE CAN PRINT AND THEY THEY'RE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY. THE SALES OF THEIR PAPER IN THEIR OPINIONS WE'VE SEEN THAT- INFORMATION DISTRIBUTED THROUGH FACEBOOK AND INTERNET AND OTHER. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE TAKING PEOPLE OFF OF THOSE AND NOT AND NOT ALLOWING US TO HAVE THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH THAT WE'VE SEEN. OVER DECADES OF PRINT AND SO I THINK THAT THE I'M WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SUNSET COME OFF COME OFF OF THIS AS WELL. I JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO SEE- TO GET INFORMATION THAT'S UNBIASED OR OR MAYBE NOT SHUT DOWN BY SOME OTHER- BILLION BILL TO TAKE PEOPLE OFF OF. THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA AND NOT A LOT THERE ALLOW THEIR VOICES TO BE HEARD EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. ARE WE TO DIFFERENT OPINION OF OURS AND STILL NEED TO BE SAID. AND I THINK THAT SAYS. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW THAT'S CHANGING AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE. SO FOR THAT REASON AND MANY OTHER REASONS ALONG WITH THE I AGREE WITH WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT AB FIVE THIS HAS CAUSED IN OUR COUNTRY DURING. A PANDEMIC IS UNFORTUNATE. AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE CARVE OUTS THAT ARE THERE. AND DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT. AND TO BE ABLE TO WORK THOSE HOURS IF THEY WANT TO WORK AND BE ABLE TO BE COMPENSATED AT A FAIR RATE AND- AND HAVE FREEDOM. BUT FRANKLY IT'S ABOUT FREEDOM AND MORE AND MORE I SEE OUR GOVERNMENT TAKING AWAY THOSE FREEDOMS. BECAUSE ONE CERTAIN OF PEOPLE WANT THEM TO BE IN THIS BOX OR THAT BOX I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO THE CALIFORNIA THESE. AMERICANS AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY STIFLING OUR FREEDOM SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'LL BE SUPPORTING AB. THREE TWO THREE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SIR.

THREE ONE EIGHT TWO. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE EIGHTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING AN ACT RELATING TO HOUSING. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT A B. THREE ONE EIGHT TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TEAM. DUE TO A LOOPHOLE IN STATE LAW H. AWAY IS ANOTHER COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS ARE ALLOWED TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT HOMEOWNERS FROM RENTING OUT THEIR HOMES. H. O. IS GOVERNED 25% OF EXISTING HOUSING AND THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN AN H. AWAY ALLOWING FOR RENTAL PROVISIONS FOR UNREASONABLE RENTAL RESTRICTIONS MEANS CALIFORNIA ISN'T TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE AVAILABLE HOUSING STOCK AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED IT THE MOST. BY ALLOWING RENTAL RESTRICTIONS THESE COMMUNITIES CAN ALSO BAN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING TYPES SUCH AS ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. EIGHTY THREE MONEY TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE BY PROHIBITING HOAS FROM BANNING OR EFFECTIVELY PROHIBITING THESE RENTALS BASED ON THE CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION THE HIGH RATES OF RENTALS CAN LEAD TO HOAS OR INDIVIDUALS- HOMEOWNERS RECEIVING INFERIOR LENDING TERMS FROM THE FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION OR THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. THE AUTHOR RECENTLY AMENDED THE BILL TO ALLOW HOAS TO CAP RENTALS AT 25% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOMES IN THE ASSOCIATION. EIGHTY THREE ONE EIGHT TWO ALSO CLOSES AN IMPORTANT LOOPHOLE ALL MAKE NEW AND EXISTING HOUSING AVAILABLE TO MORE CALIFORNIANS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SERRA GONZALEZ DEBATE ON THIS MATTER CENTER CAPITAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT- I RISE RELUCTANTLY TO OPPOSE THIS BILL AND THEN LET ME TELL YOU WHY. THE ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT JUST THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING UNITS BUT THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. HOMEOWNERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE HIGH PRICE OF OUR HOUSING. WE HAVE THE LOWEST HOME OWNERSHIP. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEN WE'VE EVER HAD IN OUR HISTORY INCLUDING RIGHT B. RIGHT AT THE TIME THAT THE GI BILL WAS INSTITUTED. AND THAT IS THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO THEIR FIRST HOME. MANY OF THE OF THE PEOPLE THAT END UP LIVING IN HOAS MOVING TO A CHOICE BECAUSE THERE ARE FOUR DOUBLE. AND THEY'RE USUALLY IN SMALLER LOT SIZES WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE END TO END AND PART OF THE REASON THEY'RE ATTRACTIVE IS THAT THEY'RE ALL OWNED. BY PEOPLE WHO WHO BUY INTO THE INTO THE PROJECTS AND WHO LIVE THERE AND ARE NOT RENTING AND SO TO OVER RULE OR OVER RIDE THE H. AWAY RULES THAT SAY. THOU SHALT NOT RENT OUT YOUR UNIT MEANS THAT WE ARE MAKING THE DECISION HERE AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO OVERRULE LOCAL LOCAL DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE ABOUTWHO WHO COULD ACTUALLY LIVE IN IN THESE IN THESE PROJECTS AND WHEN THESE UNITS SELF. PAY USUALLY G VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY'RE ONE OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT ARE STILL LEFT ON THE MARKET SO I'M GOING TO OPPOSE THIS BILL- I THINK IT IT IT- THE INTENTION WAS- IT WAS A GOOD INTENTION BUT I THINK THE INADVERTENT IMPACT IS GOING TO BE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING. AWAY THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO NOT HAVE RENTAL UNITS IN IN THEIR PROJECTS AND- AND THAT STARTS TO DEGRADE THE UNITS AND- THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE WE WANT TO SEE MORE HOME OWNERSHIP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR L. AS IN ANY FURTHER DEBATE. NINE I SEE ANY HANDS UP- SEVENTY DOLLARS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THIS IS A GREAT MEASURE- ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND WHAT- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS IS SAYING WE ABSOLUTELY WANT INCREASE HOMEOWNERSHIP IF PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE- CAPITAL TO. OWN A HOME OR THEY HAVE THEIR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T ALLOW FOR THAT THIS ALLOWS FOR THE RENTAL MARKET TO OPEN UP A BIT THROUGH H. AWAY SO. WITH THAT I AM RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR TIME.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA AN ACT RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. CENTER ACTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES. FIVE I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO PRESENT A B. TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA A BILL THAT I BELIEVE WILL BE TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR THE SAN DIEGO REGION. AT ITS CORE A B. TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE IS INTENDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY SANDAG. OUT WHICH IS OUR- METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATION TO COLLABORATE WITH THE US NAVY ON AN IMPORTANT REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT. FIRST AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE WILL STRENGTHEN THE NAVY'S PRESENCE IN AMERICA'S FINEST CITY SAN DIEGO UNLIKE OTHER NAVY INFRASTRUCTURE THE NAV FOR FACILITY WHICH IS CALLED. HOUSES THE NAVY'S CYBER SECURITY PROFESSIONALS IT DOESN'T REQUIRE PROXIMITY TO THE. WATER THIS BILL WILL FACILITATE THE- OF A MOBILITY HUB TO CONNECT DIFFERENT TRANSIT ROUTES AT ONE PLACE ALONG WITH TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. OF NEEDED HOUSING WITH COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL SPACE. MAYBE TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE WILL FACILITATE THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN AIRPORT CONNECTOR TO THE SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. NO LONGER WILL OUR AIRPORT BB ONLY MAJOR AIRPORT WITHOUT A DIRECT LINK TO THE REGIONAL RAIL SYSTEM. THE NAVY IS WELL INTO ITS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT OF THE OLD TOWN SITE. WITH THE HELP. OF THE SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA'S ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE. I THE BILL INCLUDES SEVERAL SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND REQUIRES ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS BE ACHIEVED. FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL REQUIRES THE CENTRAL MOBILITY HUB TO OBTAIN LEED GOLD CERTIFICATION. AND THE PROJECT BE GREENHOUSE GAS NEUTRAL WITH AN EMPHASIS ON LOCALIZED MITIGATION MEASURES. EIGHTY TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE REPRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THE EXISTING FIVE THOUSAND NAVY JOBS FOR RELOCATION. CREATE A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FOR SAN DIEGO AND PROVIDE SOME DESPERATELY NEEDED STIMULUS TO OUR LOCAL ECONOMY THAT SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF CODE NINETEEN. AND WITHOUT THE NEED FOR STATE FUNDS SO ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA AND MYSELF I ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER ACTIONS IS THERE A DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE CENTER PORTIS. THANK YOU IF I MAY POSE A QUESTION TO THE FLOOR MANAGER A SECOND TOO WILLING TO ACCEPT THE QUESTION- PLEASE CONTINUE KIND OF ORDERS. THANK YOU. THROUGH JUDICIARY ANOTHER- COMMITTEES AS WELL AS FLOOR I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN ADVOCATE THAT SEQUEL. HAS BEEN USED MORE AS A SORT OF DENNIS SHIELDS ON I THINK W'VE WE'VE LOST OUR WAY WHEN IT COMES TO SEE WHAT BECAUSE IT IS KEPT US FROM DOING WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS NOT IMPORTANT FACT I'M A BIG ADVOCATE OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND MANY OF YOU. ALREADY KNOW THAT IT WAS A REPUBLICAN THAT CREATED THIS AS GOVERNOR BACK IN THE DAY- SO I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S HELPFUL PRECEDENT SO MY QUESTION TO THE FLOOR MANAGER IS. NEPA RUBIO IS BEING ALLOWED TO SATISFYING SEQUEL OBLIGATIONS IN THIS PROCESS IS THAT CORRECT. WELL I THINK- EIGHTY YES IN SOME RESPECTS BECAUSE THIS PROJECT INVOLVES THE UNITED STATES NAVY AS WELL AND SO IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLEX IN TERMS OF US SOME OF THE REVIEW PROCESS ST. I ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS NOT NEGATED FROM THIS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO HAVE TO MEET ME BUT AS WELL. SO IT IS YOUR QUESTION THE OLD PRESIDIO AREA THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN THE POINT LOMA AREA ADJACENT TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DID THAT HAVE TO GO THROUGH SEE WHAT. I'M SORRY- SENATOR I DON'T REMEMBER THE HISTORY ON THAT I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK. FOR AFRICA BY THE WAY I AM THE- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STADIUM CONNIE. IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SAN DIEGO LEADERS AND OUR MILITARY. IT HAS A LONG HISTORY IN IN THE SAME DAY. BUT I WANT US TO REMEMBER THAT I SEE WHAT. IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHEN THE PRIORITY IS BIGGEST. THE CAPITAL FINDS A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK. AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT WHEN OTHERS SEE WHAT ENDEAVORS EXEMPTIONS OR STREAMLINING EFFORTS- OR FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL. I THINK IT'S NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT POLICY MAKING. I'LL BE GLAD TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY. THANK YOU SIR BORDERS SEVERAL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT I'M I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A IT'S A REALLY GOOD INVESTMENT- IN THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BUT I CAN'T I CAN'T. NOT STAND UP. ON THIS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON. TRYING TO PUT RESOURCES INTO SOME OF OUR MORE OF OUR POOREST COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE OPPORTUNITY ZONES AND IN CALIFORNIA AND THOSE ARE. CENSUS TRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED- THAT DESIGNATED OURSELVES IS THE POOREST CENSUS TRACTS AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THEM FOR FOUR YEARS AND MY MOST RECENT ATTEMPT WAS THOUGHT THROUGH THIS HOUSE I WANT TO SAY I WAS REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE DID VERY THANKFUL OF MY GOOD FRIEND. SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA WHO HELPED ME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WENT THROUGH THE MOST THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF C. CLUB WE BUILT A GOLD LEED CERTIFIED WITH- I GUARANTEE THAT THERE WOULD BE NO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS PART OF THE OF THE PROJECT BUT WE COULDN'T GET IT DONE AND IN THE ASSEMBLY AND SO I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT DOING THINGS FOR POOR PEOPLE IT SEEMS LIKE WE JUST CAN'T. GET THE COMMITMENT TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO I'M I'M HERE TO SAY I'M I'M NOT DONE I'M GONNA COME BACK- AND MY BILL HAD THE EXACT SAME EXPEDITED SEEKER REVIEW THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO STADIUMS TO TWO ARENAS PROBABLY TO THE OLYMPICS WHEN THEY COME TO LA AND NOW TO SAN DIEGO BUT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON POOR PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DESERVE TO HAVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AS WELL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT THANK YOU SIR CAMARILLO CENTER JACKSON. YEAH THANK YOU I THOUGHT TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT SICK OF BEING AT THE PUNCHING BAG. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE SEQUEL WOULD LOOK LIKE MIAMI BEACH. AND IF ANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN TO MIAMI BEACH. ARE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. THE SEQUEL PROCESS WHAT HAS PROTECTED CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES. THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE HAD AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF HEARINGS ON THIS SO THAT THE FACTS ARE CLEAR AND NOT JUST. MORE FANTASY LIKE WE SEEM TO BE GETTING. FROM SO MANY OF OUR FRIENDS- WHO- ARE UNWILLING TO. TO ACCEPT WHAT IS FACTUAL. THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS NOT CHEAPER THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS NIMBYISM. VERY DIFFERENT ISSUES. THE SIMPLE PROCESS IS DESIGNED SO THAT WE WILL. BE CLEAR AND PROTECTOR OF ALL THE COMMUNITIES AROUND WHICH THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE GOING ON BECAUSE- THE DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO BUILD GENERALLY SPEAKING. ARE MORE FOCUSED ON THEIR FINANCIAL GAIN. THE SIMPLE PROCESS REQUIRES THEM TO CONSIDER THE COMMUNITY THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES WHICH ARE WHAT MAKES CALIFORNIA IS SUCH A GREAT PLACE TO BE. THIS MEASURE DOES HAVE A- AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS SOMETHING WHICH I GENERALLY OPPOSE. BUT IN THIS CASE THE STANDARDS THAT ARE. BEING REQUIRED HERE ARE OF THE HIGHEST LEVELS. AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT GOING FORWARD PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED WILL IN FACT BE MADE OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL. AND THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE CAN DO TO EXPEDITE THE SEQUEL PROCESS WITHOUT UNDERMINING IT AND MANY OF THEM ARE BILLS THAT I'VE TRIED TO BRING FORWARD AND I HOPE IN THE FUTURE. OTHERS WILL. FOLLOW THAT EFFORT TO STREAMLINE IT BUT NOT A RADIC HATED AND UNFORTUNATELY THOSE WHO ARE- BUILDERS AND DEVELOPERS WOULD RATHER SEE IT GO AWAY FREQUENTLY SUPER BY THE WAY IS USED BY COMPETITORS IT ISN'T USED BY COMMUNITIES IT'S USED BY BUSINESSES. TO TRY TO. CREATE OBSTACLES FOR THEIR- OPPONENTS AND FOR THEIR COMPETITION SO- I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY THE MAN GLORIA FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE HE REALLY HAS INSISTED UPON A VERY HIGH BAR. THERE IS A REVIEW BUT I WILL ALSO CAUTIONED THAT THIS IS NOT ANYTHING THAT IS MANDATE THE MANDATORY THE COURTS. WILL DO THEIR BEST TO TRY TO MEET THAT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY ROOM A REVIEW. REQUIREMENT BUT THERE ARE. FRANKLY WHEN YOU TALKTO MANY OF THE- JUDGES ARE EXPERT IN THE FIELD THEY TELL YOU THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IT WITHIN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS AND THAT'S BECAUSE- BOTH SIDES. NEED THAT ADDITIONAL TIME BUT AGAIN LET'S BE CLEAR ON WHAT SHE IS INNOCENT I THINK THAT'S THE POINT HERE THIS IS A GOOD BILL- AGAIN- THERE'S NOTHING PERFECT IN THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE- BUT THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT DOES TRY TO MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST OF STANDARDS- AND HOPEFULLY WILL. BE PART OF WHAT LEADS THE WAY INTO TO PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT TO COMPLY WITH SECORD OUR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT AND ALSO ENCOURAGE THE KIND OF ADDITIONAL BUILDING THAT WE NEED HERE IN THE STATE WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE. THANK YOU SIR JACKSON CENTER GROVE. BUT. SORRY SIR I WAS WORKING OUT SOME INFORMATION WITH YOUR MAJORITY FLOOR LEADER. AND. AND I DO APOLOGIZE AND SO ALTHOUGH I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TONIGHT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS GOOD THAT WE WORK WITH THE NAVY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE C. FOR EXEMPTIONS THAT WE NEED TO SO STRINGENT IN CALIFORNIA I DO- DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN SANTA BARBARA THAT SEQUEL IS- SOMETHING THAT IS FABULOUS FOR THIS STATE IT'S ACTUALLY NOT- WE DO EXEMPTIONS ALL THE TIME FOR SEQUEL- WHEN IT SUITS SAID THE MAJORITY PARTY. AND WHEN IT- PROVIDES FOR A CONTRACT LABOR AGREEMENT- PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS SO- ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID I'LL SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT HAS THE ISSUE WITH THE UNITED STATES NAVY- THAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO I WISH THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT US HE QUIT AS A WHOLE AND REALIZE THAT SEQUEL THAT IN ITSELF IS AND DETRIMENTAL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU LOOK AT JUST PET PROJECTS BEING APPROVED BUT NORMAL PROCESSES WOULD TAKE YEARS TO GET THROUGH- EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN MITIGATED STANDARDS TO BE ABLE TO PROCEED. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME JUST- SHARE MY THOUGHTS AND I APOLOGIZE. FOR BEING ON THE PHONE WITH YOUR MAJORITY FLOOR LEADER. SO UNDERSTAND YOU TO COMMUTE. WITH A LEADERSHIP. ALL RIGHT A CENTER FOR CHIPS. I CERTAINLY WAS NOT INTENDED TO SPEAK BUT I WAS SO INSPIRED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA'S COMMENTS. THAT IS LONG AS WE HAVE STANDARDS THAT ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY IN NEED BUT CERTAINLY FALLS WITHIN THAT CATEGORY THEN ALL THE CONCERNS INVOLVING SECRET HAVE BEEN SATISFIED SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT MINE. THAT THE CHAIR JUDICIARY AGAIN MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA- IS FINISHING UP HER TENURE IN THE SENATE I WOULD HAVE REALLY ENJOYED A CONVERSATION IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE CYCLE ON THE SUPER RELATED MATTERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR BORDERS. ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL DEBATE SAYING NONE ON THE FLOOR SAYING NO HANDS UP SECRETARY. BUT WHICH SUGGESTS THAT ACTIVITY LIKE THE CLOTHES THANK YOU. MR PRESIDENT- YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY I'D THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW THAT I'VE MANAGED TO BILL FOR MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO- WHICH WE GOT INTO A ROBUST DEBATE. ABOUT PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES OF SEQUEL AND OTHER THINGS SO IT MUST BE PART OF THE PROTEINS JOB DESCRIPTION. LET ME AT THIS LATE HOUR ON. THAT PLEDGE MY SUPPORT OF COURSE TO THE SENATOR FROM SILLINESS BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS A VERY GOOD BILL- WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION AND I PLEDGE MY WORK WITH HER. ON NEXT YEAR ON THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND FINALLY I WOULD SAY THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS. HAS TO DO WITH THE TRANSPORTATION HUB WHICH AT THE END WILL HELP SAN DIEGO CHIEF STATE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES I THINK THAT'S ONE. IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC. IMPACTS FOR SAN DIEGO AND OF COURSE THE NAVY- THE HIGHEST STANDARD AS POINTED OUT BY THE CHAIR OF JUDICIARY AND AT THE SAME TIME. THE GOALS THAT IT WILL MEET THAT THAT ARE ALL ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH- AROUND CLIMATE. AND THEN LASTLY I WOULD SAY- IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS THIS ARE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY HAVE WORKED VERY HARD ON ANOTHER BILL THAT I HOPE TO SEE COME BACK THAT WILL. HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER. PROJECTS AND THAT WOULD BE S. B. NINE NINETY FIVE BUT WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER NIGHT TO DISCUSS THAT WITH THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT YOUR- CONVERSATION AND YOUR INPUT AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE.
