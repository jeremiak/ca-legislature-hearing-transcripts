YES THE NEXT OES INFECTIOUS DISEASE PREVENTION CONTROL THANK YOU [inaudible] ACTUALLY [inaudible] ALASKA. YOU CAN INTRODUCE YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD FIRST. STE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JAMES WHAT I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THANK YOU. SO WE ARE PROPOSING A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR -- INCREASE HER ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF GENERAL FUNDS TO BE EXPENDED OVER FOUR YEARS FOR THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE TO GO TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT THEIR ACTIVITIES -- IN RESPONSE-TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS -- WOULD BE FOR STATE OPERATIONS AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE FOR POSITIONS -- TO TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE. DISTRIBUTION FUNDS IN OVERSIGHT OF THIS -- THIS FUNDING PROGRAM AS WELL AS A CONTRACT WITH A THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE -- TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PROVIDE EXPERT SUPPORT. FOR IN A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AS THEY RESPOND TO THESE INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES [inaudible] BELIAU. SENATE PARTICULARLY -- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING A WELL DOCUMENTED HEALTH CRISIS WHEN IT COMES TO THE RISE OF STDS AND THE DEPARTMENTS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR RESPONDING TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS SO IN GENERAL WE SEE THE MERIT IN THIS PROPOSAL WE JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT -- THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO ASK OF THE DEPARTMENT INCLUDING -- WHETHER THE AMOUNT FOR STATE OPERATIONS IS APPROPRIATE IT'S SHARE THAN. SORRY THAT'S A HIGHER SHARE THAN WHAT IS TYPICAL AND WONDERING IF THOSE FUNDS MIGHT BE BETTER UTILIZED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- ADDITIONALLY WE HAD A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER -- THE FUNDS WOULD BE FLEXIBLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN OTHER WORDS WHAT THEY GET A ONE TIME GRANT ALLOCATION WAS SOME FLEXIBILITY ABOUT HOW TO SPEND THOSE. FUNDS OVER THE FOUR YEARS -- AND THEN FINALLY WE HAD A QUESTION ABOUT HOW THE DEPARTMENT SPECIFICALLY INTENDS TO WORK WITH AND COORDINATE WITH A TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE APPROPRIATE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND SERVICES IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU FINANCE. WE ARE ALMOST FINANCE -- I THINK WE CAN ADDRESS THE THE QUESTION WHETHER THE FUNDING ARE FLEXIBLE ARE NOT. AS RARE AND THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE ALLOW FOR EITHER A ONE TIME GRANT A LOCATION TWO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE TROUBLE COMMUNITIES TO BE SPENT OVER FOUR YEAR PERIOD OR ANNUAL GRANTS -- THAT'S SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE. MORE PREFERABLE FOR OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AND THEN I THINK MY COLLEAGUES MIGHT ON THE PITCH I CAN ANSWER THEIR MINOR THE QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY WELL I WILL. YOU CAN PLEASE -- ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ARE RAISED BY -- THE LA -- I I WOULD I WOULD JUST BEFORE WE DO THAT AND FOR EXAMPLE -- THE 20% -- GOING TO THE FIRST STATE OPERATIONS -- SO I REALIZE YOU'RE STILL TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS -- SO I NOTE THAT YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A UC CONTRACT. FOR A SOUNDS LIKE SOME KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- BY THE END I HAVEN'T TALKED TO THE HEALTH OFFICERS ABOUT THAT -- THEY SEEM TO RETAIN A LOT OF EXPERTISE ABOUT. INFECTIOUS DISEASES SIN GIVEN THE SUM OF MONEY -- NOT SURE I MEAN IF THEY'RE ASKING FOR MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE I JUST SORT OF FEEL LIKE I'M. NOW I THINK THE PROBLEM IS PRETTY EVIDENCE -- IT. THE END AND THEY HAVE THE SKILL SETS BUT YOU KNOW WE CAN YOU CAN TELL ME IF YOU HER DIFFERENTLY. AND THEN -- NO. FOR THAT AGAIN THE OLD LEVEL OVERSIGHT -- I MEAN. CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BE SURE THERE'S OVER SAY THE MONEY IS USED WISELY -- BUT I'M NOT SURE WE NEED TO SPEND 20% OF THE FUNDS DOING THAT SO I SO I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK. CLARIFICATION ON THAT THIS CAN BE REALLY IMPORTANT -- IN TERMS OF HOW IT THE FRANKLY FOR GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE THAT'S THE OPERATE WHAT WE'VE ALREADY HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE FOR SO I WON IT APPRECIATED THANK INDUSTRY FOR PUTTING THIS MONEY IN HERE SO THIS IS IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED AT THEM SOME IS RELATIVELY SMALL GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND THAT CERTAINLY WE WANT TO MAKE ONE IS MOST EFFECTIVE USE THAT I KNOW YOU DO. TOO THE FIVE THE FIVE FUNDS THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING AND WHAT BY ENTERTAIN THINKING ABOUT IS THIS. THE RIGHT AMOUNT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT AMOUNT -- GIVEN THIS THE CARD ACTUALLY THE OTHER COSTS THAT WILL GO THROUGH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT THE STATE ALSO PAYS. FOR IT WE DON'T HAVE IF WE DON'T STRENGTH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE BUT MUCH GO AHEAD AND ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS ALEJO WITH PERHAPS MY COMMENTS ADDED ON TOP. SURE THANK YOU -- SO FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL I THINK IS IS DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF OUR OTHER LOCAL SEND SUBSTANCE -- PROGRAMS IN THE DEPARTMENT HE IN EACH ONE HAS ITS OWN CONSTRAINTS BUT WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL IT'S REALLY A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. AND NO I WAS ACTUALLY TESTIFYING HERE WITH DOCTOR LOVE WHO THE HEALTH OFFICER FROM SANTA CLARA HER FROM SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID WAS THAT HE REALLY APPRECIATED THE SUPPORT THAT -- DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDED HIM AND THAT HE HOPED THAT THAT WOULD WE BE ABLE TO STRENGTHEN THAT AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR HERE WE HAVE STAFF -- WHO ARE ON THE PHONE OVER THE WEEKEND TALKING ABOUT MEASLES CASES? AND AND PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE THAT HAVE A LOT OF CAPACITY. AND CAPABILITIES BUT WE ALSO HAVE OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE SMALLER AND HAVE FEWER RESOURCES AND WE NEED TO BE PREPARED TO STEP UP AND SUPPORT THEM -- WHEN THE NEED ARISES? SO THAT'S THE THE REASON FOR THE SCOPE OF OF THE PROPOSAL -- FOR FOR LOCAL SYSTEMS. YOUR SOME OTHER QUESTIONS LIKE TRAVELS IN YEAH SURE. SO -- WE PARTNER WITH -- SOME AGENCIES WHEN WE WORK WITH TRAVEL COMMUNITIES WE WORK WITH OTHER AGENCIES PARTICULARLY THE CALIFORNIA RURAL INDIAN HEALTH BOARD AND SO -- THAT WOULD BE A REALLY IMPORTANT -- ENTITY FOR US TO REACH OUT TO IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHY -- TRIBAL NEEDS ARE AND WHAT THE INPUT FROM OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WOULD BE IN TERMS OF THESE RESOURCES SO OUR PLAN WOULD BE. TO REACH OUT TO THEM AND TO GET INPUT AS TO HOW WE COULD PASSED ME TO LEAVE MEET THE NEEDS OF OF TRAVEL COMMUNITIES [inaudible] OKAY. THE MORE DETAIL WOULD PROBABLY BE IS C.. V. HELPFUL -- SO SO IT'S WANT TO CLARIFY THE 20% FOR STATE OPERATIONS BECAUSE WHAT WAS INITIALLY PRESENTED AS THIS IS OVERSIGHT OVER THESE FUNDS. SO THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN SAYING THAT WELL. BUT I'M SURE YOU ALSO SAY SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT BECAUSE I THINK WHATEVER LANGUAGE WE END UP. TRAILER BILL WHATEVER ELSE THAT GOES WITH THIS MONEY. I I CERTAINLY CAN UNDERSTAND SAYING WELL ACTUALLY WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN BECAUSE IT IS A PARTNERSHIP RIGHT WE FIRST YEAR IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCALS AND REWRITE DIFFERENT COUNTIES HAVE DIFFERENT CAPACITIES SO. IF YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT WELL WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE PUTTING 20% FOR STATE OPERATIONS SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. NOT JUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT ALSO YOU KNOW DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO COUNTY SPECIALLY SMALLER COUNTIES THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY RIGHT WE NEED TO BUILD. SO THAT WE HAVE THAT FLEXIBLE AND WE'RE GONNA BASE THAT AT THE STATE. THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THEN I'M GONNA HIGHER FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA LIKE GO AND BE SURE EVERYONE DID ALL THEIR COUNTING RIGHT ON THESE GRANTS RATE SO THE OVER SAID GRANT SO I WANT TO CLARIFY. IS INTENTION OF THE STATE OPERATIONS THEY REALIZE THERE'S SOME STAFF TIME HAS GOT THE USED TO BE SURE THAT THE GRANTS OR YOU KNOW AT THAT THE MONEY WAS SENT TO THE MONEY WAS SPENT APPROPRIATELY AND NOW WHATEVER REPORTS AT CETERA BUT I'M HOPING WE'RE NOT SPENDING 20% DOING. THAT AND THAT PERHAPS WERE SPENDING MAYBE 5% DOING THAT HUNTER HAS THE 15% ACTUALLY PROVIDING ASSISTANCE FOR INFECTION CONTROL THAT IS THE OUTDOOR STAFFING UP FOR THAT THAT'S WHO ARE HIRING ARE NOT HIRING PEOPLE JUST TO DO. CREATE REVIEW ARE SET AND SO FORTH SO MAYBE FINANCE ONCE ADDRESS THAT. YES SO OF THE EIGHT MILLION% THAT'S FOR STATE OPERATIONS ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION WOULD BE FOUR FOUR STAFF POSITIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT WOULD BE MORE. FOR A DURING THE TRADITIONAL GRANT OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES THE REMAINDER OF THE ONE POINT HOW MUCH ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION. OKAY -- THAT'S OVER THE FOUR YEARS. THAT'S CORRECT. AND THE REMAINDER OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE. USED FOR INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT. TO BUY THEIR CONTRACT WITH AS AN EXAMPLE A UC EURYSTHEUS YOU ENTITY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AND MORE DIRECT SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ON INCLUDING SURVEILLANCE ASSISTANCE -- I'D ADDING A TRAINING MATERIALS AND OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD HELP THE LOCALS A DURING AN OUTBREAK OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES OR ANYTHING ELSE OF THAT NATURE THAT. WOULD HELP THE SMALLER ENTITIES THAT DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THAT CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO SO MANY JUST CLARIFY THOUGH. SO YOU WANT YOU SEE TO DO THAT OR THE STATE I MEAN THE I'M HEARING A CONTRACT WITH YOU SEE. THE RATIONALE FOR YEAH VERSES THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT I MEAN I USED TO BE BACK IN THERE YOU SEE SO I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR YOU SEE HIM BUT THEY'RE NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY IMMEDIATE PEOPLE FOR A DAY OF SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE TEACH PUBLIC. HEALTH I MEAN I'M NOT SAYING PEOPLE THOUGH THERE'S SOME SOME CAPACITY THERE BUT USUALLY THAT'S NOT THERE. TRADITIONAL ROLE IS TO SO I MEAN I GUESS THEY CAN DEVELOP MATERIALS AND SO FORTH BUT YEAH WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE -- SPEECH AT TO IDENTIFY STAFF THAT CAN HELP US WORK WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THEY HAVE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM -- USING THOSE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CURRENTLY DO AND AND WOOD PLANT AT YOU WITH THIS WITH THIS PROJECT OKAY WELL I I GUESS WHAT I'D SAY IS IS THAT AT LEAST WHAT I'VE BEEN HER HEARING INVOLVED AGE SIXTY SO INSTEAD. OF A PUBLIC COMMENT IS THAT. I'VE HEARD MORE FROM LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT THEY NEED. PEOPLE ON THE GROUND LIKE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF OF THERE'S AN OUTBREAK I HEAR ABOUT YOU KNOW LAB RESOURCES OF FORCE -- NOT TO SAY THAT SOME OF THEM COULDN'T USE LIKE TECHNO SYSTEMS TRAINING MATERIALS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT A.. N. D. AGAIN I DON'T THINK DOWN OF SAME AS ADULT OFFICERS HERE THEY CAN SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES BUT I I JUST WANNA BE SURE WERE EFFECTIVELY USING THE I MEAN THAT THIS IS AN ALL AUTUMN BALLOTS THIS WAS A IT'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY GIVEN THE SCALE. OF THE PROBLEM AND I AND SO. IF YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE THAT EVEN EVEN THE WHOLE FORTY BILL WITH FORTY MILLION OVER FOUR YEARS I MEAN THERE'S ONLY. ME STAFF THE HIGHER IT'S AT WITH THAT AND SO I JUST WANNA BE SURE WE'RE PROVIDING THE COULD RIGHT KIND OF ASSISTANCE TO OUR HEALTH OFFICERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY AND IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE. DOING THAT YOU KNOW YOU I KNOW REAL I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU WORK WITH THE MORE CLOSELY THAN I DO SO -- BUT WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING IS MORE ABOUT WE NEED PEOPLE ON THE GROUND I AND THAT -- IT'S NOT AS MUCH TRAINING MATERIALS NOT SAYING THAT THEY CAN USE TRAINING BUT IT'S MORE ABOUT YOU KNOW WE NEED MANY PEOPLE HEALTH HAS TO STUFF AND WERE HAVING A HARD TIME ON RUBIO GETTING GETTING THE PEOPLE. STILL HAVE MONEY RIGHT ARE OF SUCH AS IT WERE CUT OVER THE RECESSION SO FORTH AND THE COUNTIES. YEAH AND DAT INTERESTED TO RESPOND TO THAT. WE ENVISION THAT THE SOME OF THESE RESOURCES THE PLEASE TECHNICAL RESOURCES WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO HELP LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN A SEARCH SITUATION SO PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP WITH DATA MANAGEMENT. FOR THERE'S A LARGE EXPOSURE TO MEANS ALL OF IT -- YOU KNOW. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS NO YOU SEE WHAT ACTUALLY TO HELP THEM DO THE DATA MANAGER DIRECTLY IT'S NOT JUST LIKE FOR WRITING IT VICE AND HOW TO DO IT EXACTLY ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE WAS MULTIPLE OUT ON X. AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU SAW MEASLES AND USE OUR CONTRACTS IF. WAS IN USE I MEAN YOU NEED PUTS ON THE GROUND WHICH ALSO NAY RISK COMMUNICATION UNIT AT B. SURVEILLANCE ON A LOT OF TEACHERS SECTIONS JUST DON'T HAVE THAT CAPACITY. SO THEY CERTAINLY TURNED TO US TO ACTUALLY TRY TO HELP THEM IN THAT REGARD WE SAW THAT OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS WITH SOME OF THESE OUTBREAKS. ESPECIALLY ONES THAT WERE HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL THERE'S NO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COULD YOU WANT TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AND SURE MEMBERS RAND MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. IF THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL A DEAL IN AT LEAST IN PART WITH THE ESCALATING LCD EPIDEMIC. THIS PROPOSAL IS WHOLLY INADEQUATE -- FIRST OFFICE ONE TIME -- ONE TIME ONLY FUNDING FORTY MILLION OVER FOUR YEARS WE WOULD WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS PATH BEFORE WHEN YOU APPROPRIATED FIVE MILLION IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT WAS EXPENDED OVER THREE YEARS DPH SO THEY COULD NOT SPEND IT ON THE THINGS THAT WERE NEEDED. LIKE WHICH WHICH AS YOU MENTIONED WAS BOOTS ON THE GROUND -- AND FOUR FORTY MILLION OVER FOUR YEARS DOES NOT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY IT PAY FOR THE NGOING COST. IT'S TOO SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY FORTY MILLION TO DEAL WITH ALL INFECTIOUS DISEASES STDS -- HIS HAS BEEN HOSTILE OR KLAY UNDERFUNDED -- AND NEEDS ADDITIONAL MONEY -- THERE IS -- NO FURTHER DIRECTION TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THE STDS YOU HAVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO CONSIDER -- IN A LEAVE IT WITH THAT THANK YOU [inaudible] YOU.

DATA FROM. THE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION FROM EMS KIND OF ALL REAL TIME DATA AND I'M MORE QUICKLY WE CAN BUILD THAT DATA INTO A SYSTEM AND THAT'S REAL TIME. THE BETTER WE CAN TARGET ANY INTERVENTIONS THAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO TO REDUCE THE RISK BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT FOR PREGNANT WOMEN FOR USE. THAT THEY REALLY DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH US. THANK YOU LA A SENATE PARTICULARLY -- AS YOU KNOW IN GENERAL ARE OFFICE IT HAD SOME RECOMMENDATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE USE ACCOUNT FUNDS OVERALL AND SETTING UP SORT OF A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS WISELY -- SITTING UP SORT OF A LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK -- REGARDING THIS -- SPECIFIC PROPOSAL I GUESS THE ONE QUESTION THAT OUR OFFICE WOULD HAVE IS JUST HOW THE DATA INTERFACING WOULD INCLUDE. THIS IS SPECIFIC TO CANNABIS USE BUT HOW IT WOULD INCLUDE OTHER FORMS OF SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES SO THAT YOU CAN DO SOME COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ACROSS ALCOHOL OPIOIDS. YOU KNOW THE OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES FACING YOUTH. ANY COMMENTS OKAY QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES CENTER SOME THANK YOU MISTER -- WHAT THE? TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS ARE YOU CONSIDERING PROVIDING PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS TO TRY TO CURB. VIEWS UTILIZATION OF MARIJUANA. SO WE WOULD DO WHAT WE DID WITH THE LET'S TALK CANNABIS CAMPAIGN AS WE DID EXACTLY THAT -- PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS WE HAVE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN FOR USE FOR PARENTS -- M. AS WE GET BETTER DATA WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THOSE MORE IMPACTFUL -- AND WE WOULD CONTINUE DOWN THAT PATH WE'D ALSO DO YOU MORE SOCIAL MEDIA -- THE PSAS ARE ONE AVENUE BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE WAY THAT YOU'VE GOT INFORMATION IS DIFFERENT THAN IT USED TO BE. AND SO THE MORE WE CAN ADVERTISE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND USE DIFFERENT AVENUES SO THAT WE ACTUALLY GOT PEOPLE WHERE THEY LEARN THE MOST YEAH AND I SEE IS A PART OF THOSE THREE MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO THE C. H. P. TO THAT BETTER PROTOCOLS TO IDENTIFY THOSE THAT. MIGHT BE INTOXICATED I'M WONDERING IF THROUGH PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS WE CAN MAKE THE ANALOGY TO DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL THE DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OF MARIJUANA -- COULD GET YOU ARRESTED IT CAN CAUSE SEVERE ACCIDENTS AND MORBIDITY AND AND DEATH -- BECAUSE BELIEVE OR NOT A LOT OF USE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT -- UTILIZING -- ONE OR EVEN OUR CONTACTS IF YOU'RE DRIVING IN -- INTOXICATED DOES MATTER WITHIN TOXICANT IS -- YOU CAN BE CITED AND SO -- I MIGHT JUST SUGGESTED MAYBE LOOK INTO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OF TRAFFIC SAFETY AND HER DH CS TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AS WELL THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU FOR FOR THAT. CERTIFICATE FOR TEENS TO INTRODUCE SORT OF SORRY THESE YEAH HI YES -- AND YOU KNOW ONE OTHER THING WILL BE ENGAGING IN THIS FORMATIVE RESEARCH WHICH IS REALLY GETTING OUT AND TALKING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS ON CALIFORNIA TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS AROUND IT AND FORMING. OUR OWN MESSAGES AROUND THAT. AND ALSO JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE LA AS QUESTION ABOUT HOW THESE ACTIVITIES ACCORDING WITH OTHER -- SUBSTANCE USE -- DATA COLLECTION ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS AND WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU AND WE ARE BUILDING WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE ECOSYSTEM OF DATA WHICH IS A HUB THAT BASICALLY BRINGS IN ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES SO THAT WE CAN DO MORE PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS AND LOOKING. ACROSS THOSE DATA SETS WE WERE FORTUNATE TO GET SOME OPIOID USE REDUCTION MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE BUILDING THAT INTO OUR DATA SETS SORATHER THAN DUPLICATE WILL USE THESE DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE ARE GETTING A DATA SET THAT WE ARE. GETTINGTHE DATE OF SAY FROM MEDICAL RECORD THAT WOULD INCLUDE OPIOIDS BUT WHEN INCLUDE CANNABIS WOULD INCLUDE WHATEVER OTHER KINDS OF THINGS WITH IT SO WE'RE NOT BUILDING THINGS MULTIPLE TIMES. REALLY ARE LOOKING AT BUILDING HAVING TRULY IN THE END ONE DATA SAID THE COVERS ALL ACT SUBSTANCE USE THAT RIGHT SO EVERYTHING COMES INTO A HUB THE DATA MAY LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT EVERYTHING CAN COME INTO ONE SYSTEM. OKAY. RIGHT REPUBLICAN IT. I'LL GET INTO THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE -- SOME INVESTMENT FOR SURVEILLANCE FOR CANNABIS SIMILAR TO TOBACCO SURVEILLANCE WE KNOW THAT THAT INFORMATION HELPS TO INFORM OUR APPROACHES IN OUR MESSAGING IN OR OUT REGION INTERVENTIONS.

THANK YOU MISTER MEMBER PALLY ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THE REQUESTED WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET IS ROUGHLY TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS -- TO ADD TWENTY STAFF TOWARD DISASTER SERVICES BUREAU. SINCE ABOUT TWENTY FIFTEEN THE NATURE OF DISASTER IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY FIRES OUSTER HAS REALLY CHANGED -- WE'RE SEEING EACH YEAR ON PRESIDENTE TOPPING THE LAST YEAR'S UNPRECEDENTED -- FIRES THAT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING FIRES FLOODS MUD SLIDES -- OFTEN NOW OCCURRING SIMULTANEOUSLY IN TWO AREAS OF THE STATE AT THE SAME TIME -- EACH ONE OF THOSE HAS GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN HOW WE CAN DO THINGS BETTER AND IN EACH AND EVERYONE THERE THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO LEARN HOW TO BETTER SERVE THE PUBLIC. WHEN TEY ARE FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVES DURING AN EMERGENCY WE HAVE TO BUT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STATE'S EMERGENCY PLAN FOR PROVIDING FOR MASS CARE AND SHELTER SO THAT MEANS PARTNERING WITH THE RED CROSS? IMPORTANTLY IT MEANS PARTNERING WITH COUNTIES BECAUSE COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY THE FIRST RESPONDERS THEY'RE THE ONES ON THE GROUND ASKING FOR HELP IN LOOKING FOR US TO COME IN. AN IMPORTANT LESSON THAT WE LEARNED DURING ALL OF THESE IS THE IS THAN NEED ABSOLUTE CRITICAL NEED TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS DO DRILLS AND EXERCISES. REGULAR MEETINGS AND PLANNING WITH THOSE LOCAL RESPONDERS AND OTHER AND OTHER RESPOND HERS AND DEVELOP THOSE RELATIONSHIPS LONG AHEAD OF A FIRE -- DURING SOME OF THE RECENT FIRES THE VENTRO FIRE THE NAPA AND SONOMA FIRES IN PARTICULAR AND ALSO IN BUTTE COUNTY WE HAVE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS PEOPLE KNEW WHO ARE DISASTER SERVICES MANAGERS WERE. VAIN KNEW WHO PEOPLE WERE ON THE GROUND EVERYBODY HAD EACH OTHER CELL PHONE NUMBERS AND THEY KNEW THAT OUR STAFF WERE THERE TO SUPPORT THEM IN WHATEVER THEIR REQUESTS WERE. THEY HAD CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO PROVIDE THAT ROLE BUT AS WE SAW THESE TO THESE CONFLAGRATIONS HAPPENING AT SUCH A LARGE LEVEL AND AT THE SAME TIME. OUR STAFF IS ABSOLUTELY PULLED IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS -- OUR STOP PUT IN OVER THREE HUNDRED OF HOURS OF OVERTIME IN A SINGLE MONTH -- IT WAS IT'S A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN OPERATION AND ONE CAN'T BE IN TWO PLACES AT THE SAME TIME SO WE REALLY NEED TO CREATE. THOSE WERE PLANNING AND PREPAREDNESS WHICH ACTUALLY HELPS WHEN THE DISASTER IS ACTUALLY OCCURRING. THE THE NEED TO HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE ON SITE ALL OF OUR STAFF NOT ONLY STATE THAT IS MANY OF THE STAFF TO FROM FROM THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS. WE HAVE TO STAFF THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER TWENTY FOUR HOURS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK WE STAFF OUR OWN DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS CENTER. THE RED CROSS AND COUNTIES THE THREE TYPES OF SHELTERS ARE OVERRUN OPEN UP RED CROSS OPERATED SHELTERS COUNTY OPERATED SHELTERS AND AND OTHER TYPES OF COMMUNITIES NEIGHBOR HELPING NEIGHBOR TYPE SHELTERS THAT WILL POP UP IN CHURCHES ARE PARKING LOTS. AND THEY ALL NEED STAFF ON THE GROUND TO HELP THEM RUN THAT SHELTER AS BEST AS POSSIBLE THEY ALSO NEED STAFF TO RUN OUT SHELTER WHICH FREQUENTLY ARE STOPPER CALLED UPON TO VOLUNTEER. AS BOMB WE CALL THEM BEST MEMBERS BUT IT'S BASICALLY ESSENTIALLY SERVING A SHELTER STOP DOING WHATEVER IS REQUIRED AT THE SHIP AT THE SHELTER. THAT REQUIRES A DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS CENTER TO BE CALLING OUR STAFF WHO VOLUNTEERED AHEAD OF TIME AND SAY CAN YOU SHOW UP IN BUTTE COUNTY IN TWO HOURS -- SO DOING ALL OF THAT THAT LOGISTICAL WORK UP FRONT AND DISASTERS DON'T AND WHEN THE WHEN THE FIRE IS OUT. THE DISASTER CONTINUES FOR MOUNT MULTIPLE MONTHS AFTER THAT FOR DISASTER CAL FRONTAGE. WITH STATE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT PROGRAMS WITH HELPING TO WORK WITH FEMA TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN DISPLACED. AND OUR STAFF DOES ALL OF THE PAPERWORK AND EVERYTHING THAT SUPPORTS THAT AND THE PAPERWORK IS UNIMAGINABLE -- FOR HOW MUCH HAS TO GO INTO TO DOING ALL OF THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT THAT'S COMMUNITY CAN ACTUALLY GET ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. AND THAT WERE PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE LOCALS SO WE KNOW THAT IT'S THAT IT'S A LARGE HOUSE FOR STAFF BUT WE THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICALLY NECESSARY. FOR THE STATE TO BE BETTER PREPARED NOT ONLY FOR FAR UPCOMING FIRE SEASON BUT FOR THE EARTHQUAKE THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT IS GOING TO OCCUR [inaudible] SOON. THANK YOU. ALEJO FUNNY PARTICULARLY -- OUR OFFICES REVIEW THESE PROPOSALS AND DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS DOES NOT HAVE CONCERNS AT THIS TIME OKAY FINANCE. THREE MEMBERS. OF PUBLIC COMMENT.

AND TO TELL HER THAT THIS IS NOT A STATE PRIORITY IN FITS OF PRIORITY FOR YOU YOU SHOULD PAY FOR IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND SO WE'D ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO RECONSIDER THEIR DECISION. AND THAT'S THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT A REQUEST [inaudible] THANK YOU. HELLO OVER A MINUTE BUT STATION YES. YES SINGER CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES -- WERE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE INCREASE STATE STAFFING RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO DISASTERS AND APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP -- WITH STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS COUNTIES OF BURNS FUNDING TO THESE INCREASING DISASTERS -- IN ADDITION WE DO SUPPORT THE REQUEST TO AUTOMATE A DISASTER CAL FOR ACTUALLY COUNTIES CAN PARTNER WITH THE STATE. ADMINISTERED IS VITAL BENEFITS IN THE MOST EFFICIENT QUICK MANNER AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. BOB LET ME POSE THE QUESTION. THE THOSE PRODUCTS -- THE NIGHT TRAIN AND I KNOW WE'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE -- SO WHAT WAS IN TERMS OF IN SOME SENSES FOR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS THE CASE IS BEING MADE THAT THIS WOULD. REALLY EXPEDITE -- I REALIZE THAT WE HAVE. WE NEED PEOPLE DO ALL THE OTHER TASKS SO ROB FOR US BUT THIS WOULD ALSO GREATLY EXPEDITE PEOPLE BE ABLE TO GET THEIR HELP SO. MAYBE CAN SPEAK TO THAT. HER WORDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S AN ALIGNMENT ON AUTOMATING DISASTER CAL FRESH WOULD BE A GOOD THING. HOWEVER WERE IN DISAGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTY IS AT THIS POINT OVER WHETHER OR NOT THAT FINDING -- IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE IN THEIR EXISTING MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS BUDGET. SO THERE IS A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT. WHERE THE FUNDING SHOULD COME FROM WE BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FUNDING IN THE MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS BUDGET FOR THE SAUCE SYSTEM CURRENTLY THAT CAN ABSORB THOSE CHANGES? IF THE COUNTIES PRIORITIZE THOSE CHANGES OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION IS IS THAT -- THE CURRENT ALLOCATION TO THE COUNTIES. CONTAINS THE FUNDING FOR DOING THE AUTOMATION THAT. THERE IS A MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS BUDGET THAT'S PROVIDE IT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY FOR THE SAUCE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS COUNTIES TO MAKE CHANGES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES OR CLAN EFFICIENCIES SUCH AS THESE. WE BELIEVE THAT CAN BE PRIORITIZED WITHIN THAT BUDGET. OKAY SO WITH AND SALAS. OKAY ALL RIGHT THIS RICHARD LIKE THAT WITH THAT AMOUNT HASN'T CHANGED IN IT OVER A DECADE THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS BUDGET FOR SAUCES BEEN. FLAT FOR OVER A DECADE OKAY AND SO THAT THAT SUGGESTION THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES WITHIN THE EXISTING BUDGET IS NOT TRUE. WELL THE THANK YOU GIVE ME THE PRIVILEGE OF FOR THE LA.

Q. L. L.. WE AGREE WITH THE AUGMENTATION HERE IN JANUARY WE POINTED OUT THAT THAT RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS WAS STILL TAKING LONGER THAN WE EXPECTED -- WE DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS OUT TO THE ADMINISTRATION WE JUST SENT THEM ABOUT SORT OF THE ACTUAL NUMBER IN THE METHODOLOGY SO BE WORKING THROUGH THAT AND RAISE ANY ISSUES OF AS THEY COME U. OKAY THANK YOU FINANCE. JUST FINISHED A BERMAN FINANCES WERE CLARIFIED THAT THE THE ITS ONGOING FUNDING THAT IS OUR ONE TIME THERE IS SOMEONE GOING ARE OF A FUNDING. FOR PROBATION RELATED WORK BUT THE FUNDING INCLUDED IN THE MAYOR VISION IS ONE TIME FOR ABOUT YEAR OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT COMMITTEE MEMBER MISSIONS ARE A PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MAKE WITH CWD A WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ADDITION TO THE MAYOR VISION. ON IN OUR MEMBERS OPINION THERE'S ON GOING WORK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FAA AND SO -- THOUGH THAT BUDGET AUGMENTATION THE MAY REVISION IS ONE TIME WE LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING WITH THE NEW SECRETARY IN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION ABOUT CC ARE GENERALLY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ONGOING COST. THAT ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T APPRECIATE WHAT'S IN THERE NOW MY LOOK FOR TO KEEP TALKING. YOU THANKS BOBBIE SANTOS ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA -- WE ALSO ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE PARTIAL RESTORATION WOULD BE EVEN MORE APPRECIATIVE IF THE FULL TWENTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION WERE -- WERE RESTORED -- THERE CONTINUES TO BE SIX MILLION DOLLAR DELTA THAT WERE LOOKING FOR BUT WE'RE VERY VERY APPRECIATED APPRECIATIVE BECAUSE THE WORK CONTINUES AND THE ONLY WAY WE ARE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY AND APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED THE BACKLOG. IS IF THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO DO SO I WON ALSO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MISTER MECCA THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING CONVERSATIONS REGARDING OUT YOUR FUNDING. THANK YOU WELCOME.

AND SUPPORT OF THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OVERALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT SO -- WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL AND EMERGENCY CARE GIVEN THE CARE GIVER PLACEMENT TRAIL TROUBLING WHICH THIS [inaudible] OF I ON THIS ISSUE -- IN OUR CONVERSATIONS AROUND CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM -- WANT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS IDENTIFIED -- PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE LAG IN -- IN APPROVAL OF RESOURCE FAMILY HOMES WAS THE FACT THAT WHEN WE ASK. OUR PARENTS AND OTHER PROVIDERS TO STEP UP AND PROVIDE CARE -- IT HISTORICALLY WE HAVEN'T PROVIDED FUNDING FOR IT TO SUPPORT THAT CHILD IN THAT PLACEMENT UNTIL THE HOME IS ACTUALLY BEEN APPROVED. A COUPLE YEARS AGO IN THE BUDGET THAT WE BEGAN THE POLICY OF FINDING OUT THAT THE DATE OF A A PLACEMENT OF THE CHILD REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE HOME HAD YET BEEN APPROVED THEIR TIME LIMITS ON THAT FUNDING. IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR -- STATE FINDINGS AVAILABLE FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS -- BEFORE THE HOME IS APPROVED AND THEN IF THERE'S GOOD BECAUSE THIS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE STATE FAMILY AND COUNTY TO TO APPROVE THE HOME -- UP TO ONE YEAR OF FINDING UNDER CURRENT STATUTE IN BUDGET YEAR -- THAT STATE FUNDING WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE AFTER NINETY DAYS SO WE'RE PROPOSING -- TO DO TWO THINGS -- ONE EXTEND THAT NINETY DAYS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND BUDGET YEAR AND ALLOW GOOD CAUSE FOR UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS AN OUTLINE LANGUAGE I BELIEVE THIS GOING TO BE FORTHCOMING LATER TODAY -- SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO TO READ THAT -- AND THEN FUNDING TO MATCH. OKAY THANK YOU ALEJO. WE AGREE THAT THE AUGMENTATION AND THAT THE CONCEPT IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE MAKES SENSE WE ARE WAITING TO REVIEW THE LANGUAGE AND WE LIKE TO LOOK AT IT IN LIGHT OF UPDATED ACTUAL IS ON HOW LONG IT IS TAKING TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS FOR THESE FAMILIES. THANK YOU FINANCE. RIGHT A PUBLIC COMMENT. IT IS SHORT FOR THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AND WE APPRECIATE THE EXTENSION OF THE EMERGENCY CARE GIVER FUNDING. TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS BUT WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE GOOD CAUSE EXCEPTION CONTINUE TO BE FO THE FULL THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS AND NOT BE CUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS AS PROPOSED -- THE PRIOR ISSUE SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL STILL HAS A BACKLOG WE KNOW THAT IT'S STILL TAKING ON AVERAGE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS TO GET THREE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL WHICH MEANS MANY FAMILIES ARE TAKING. MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS SO IF YOU CUT OFF FUNDING AT A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS WITH NO GOOD BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY PUNISHING THOSE FAMILIES GOOD BECAUSE MEANS THERE WAS A FINDING THAT IT'S NOT THE CARE GIVERS FAULT. AND IT'S NOT THE COUNTY'S FAULT THAT THE DELAY IS TAKING SO LONG I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD DEPRIVE THOSE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OF ON GOING CRITICAL FUNDING THAT STABILIZES PLACEMENTS WHEN IT'S BEEN DETERMINED THAT IT'S NO FAULT OF ANYONE THAT THE DELAYS TAKEN SO LONG SO WEEKS. WE ASK THAT IT BE EXTENDED THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS THANK YOU. OKAY FRANK MCCOURT CWD A LINING OUR COMMENTS WITH THE THAT VERY -- A PROFOUND -- AND SENSIBLE ARGUMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE THE SHORTS I THANK YOU WELCOME. TO BE SANCHEZ A CA YOU CALIFORNIA WHAT INDIAN FRANK SAID. THANK YOU. OKAY. DOESN'T GET CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT APPRECIATE INCREASE INVESTMENT HERE WOULD ALLOW MY COMMENTS WITH THE PRICE BECAUSE AS WELL. THANK YOU. QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY SO I GUESS I'LL JUST THAT I'VE HEARD SIMILAR QUESTION NAY RIDLEY ALL ELIA SAID NO WE'RE WAITING FOR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CHAU LOOKING AT DATA BUT I MEAN OVERSIGHT HEARING FROM PEOPLE -- ANYTHING FOR IT'S TAKING A LOT MORE TO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS SO WAS THERE A REASON. FOR MOVING IT FROM. THREE SIXTY FIVE TO ONE EIGHTY ONE SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES WHO ARE TAKING MORE THAN A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS -- AND AGAIN THIS IS FOR GOOD COST SO IT'S NOT. YEAH. JUST RATE IS FOR FANS SO WITH THE PERSON WE'VE TAKEN LARA THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS LAST YEAR AND THE GOAL IS TO LOOK AT YEAR BY YEAR TO SEE WHERE THINGS ARE GOING. OF THE DEPARTMENT AND COUNTIES OF WORKS -- VERY WELL TOGETHER MAKING SIGNIFICANT STRIDES ON REDUCING THAT BACK LONG TIME -- TO APPROVE AN APPLICATION -- SO CONSIDERING THAT AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WAS INCLUDED IN. THE ME REVISION FOR THAT ARE ARE IF THEY ADMINISTRATION IN THE BACKLOG -- WE WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE THE TIME IS GONNA CONTINUE TO REDUCE AND BEST PRACTICES LEARN FROM THE CHALLENGES LEAVE THOSE THAT. ARE POTENTIALLY NONCE -- RELATED TO THE THE CARE GIVER OR THE COUNTY THAT WE SHOULD SEE REDUCTION AND THAT -- SO THAT'S WHY WE WE LOOKED AT EXTENDING THE POOL TIME TWO HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS FROM HER NINETEEN TO GIFT WHERE THE STATE COVERS A COUNTY SHARE BUT ALSO REDUCING THAT GOOD KONSTANTIN. JUST AGAINST IT TO SEE HOW THINGS WORK AS WE ARE SEEN GOOD STRIDES AND EVERYTHING WE'RE SAYING IS THE INTENT OF OF ALL OF THIS LEGISLATION AND IS. TO GET THE APPROVAL DONE WITHIN NINETY DAYS TO GET THE CARE GIVERS THE FUNDING AND ALSO GET THEM MOVING FORWARD TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF CARE THAT THEY MAY BE RECEIVING. OKAY WELL I MEAN I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I THINK THE OBVIOUSLY THE GOAL IS I MEAN WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE. TO THREE AT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS. SO I MEAN THE HOPE IS IS IN THE GOAL IS TO SHRINK THAT TIME AND THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WERE DESTROYED ALLOCATING THE MONEY I'M I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS UNTIL WE PROVE WE'VE DONE THAT. RIGHT I MEAN WE'RE PUTTING THE RESOURCES MAKING DECISIONS A DRIVE THAT BUT UNTIL WE PROVEN WE'VE DONE THAT. IF WE ALSO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE TO SAY BECAUSE THEY HAS IS AGAIN IT'S FOR GOOD COPS SO IT'S NOT A SITUATION WHERE A PERSON DEL THEY'RE SAYING ARMS GOING TO STALL AND WAIT FOR THE UNDER SIXTY FIVE AND DRAG THIS THING OUT IF THEY'RE DRAGGING IT OUT THEN THEY DON'T. GET THE MONEY ANYWAY. I I DON'T FAMILIES GETTING CAUGHT BETWEEN SO IDEALLY WHAT HAPPENS WE MADE INVESTMENT WITH A SHRINK THOSE BACKLOGS SHRINK THE TIME AND VERY FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY GOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF IT AT THAT OUTSIDE BUT IF. WE HAPPEN TO BE A LITTLE WRONG. AND THERE'S SOME FAMILIES WERE CAUGHT THERE I HATE FOR THEM TO GET FALL BETWEEN THE CRACKS SO I GUESS THAT'S WHY I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO SHOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE THE STATE THEY THEMSELVES DRAG IT OUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE MONEY ANYWAY. RIGHT. EIGHT THREE WITH RECOGNIZING THIS CONCERNS AND THAT'S WHERE THE WE TAKE AN APPROACH IN THERE THIS ISN'T WITH US IN THIS TO BE A FINAL SOLUTION THE ANIMAL -- IN SOLUTION FOR EVERYTHING -- AND YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WTH THE DEPARTMENT OF COUNTY TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING AND WORK WITH THEM ON ON THE BEST WAY TO GO FORWARD ON EVERYTHING. I APPRECIATE THAT OKAY WELL YOU SEE THAT YES IF I MAY TO I I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ALTHOUGH TECHNICALLY THE STATUE DOESN'T REQUIRE PAYMENT BE ON THOSE TIME FRAMES WE FIND IT HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT COUNTIES WOULD AT THE END OF THE DAY.

ON THIS MATTER THANK YOU THIS MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CAN DO COTTON CONTINUUM OF CARE FROM CONTRACTS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PARTICULAR PLACES OUTLINED IN THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL -- THEY DEFINE FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT -- SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF CONTRACTS AND THEY'RE SMALL AND VERY NARROWLY TAILORED TO SPECIFIC PURPOSES. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO EXPEDITE GETTING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CERTAIN TRAINING ACTIVITIES TO COUNTIES IN A IN A FASTER MANNER. THE COUNTIES AND OTHER PROVIDERS AND SO WE'RE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING APPROVAL OF THAT LANGUAGE IT'S OKAY THANK YOU ALEJO. ONCE FINANCE. PUBLIC COMMENTS. HE COMMENTS THAT. RIGHT WELL WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE EFFICIENCY SO HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN -- THIS MOVE ON THEN TO ISSUE NUMBER -- SIX BUT THE BILL LANGUAGE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME REAPPROPRIATION -- I BELIEVETHE LANGUAGE -- ALLOWS -- MONEY APPROPRIATED IN THE PRIOR YEAR TWO FISCAL YEARS I THINK SEVENTEEN AND THE EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEARS -- TO TO BE -- ROLLED OVER INTO BUDGET YEAR ANYTHING THAT'S NOT YET SPENT -- AND THAT'S REALLY ALL IT DOES OKAY THANK YOU L. L. FINANCE. IT IS FOR FRIENDS THIS IS JUST TECH -- TECHNICAL CLEAN UP FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT -- LANGUAGE WASN'T INCLUDED TO TO A MISHAP SO WE THAT'S ABOUT IT OKAY THANK YOU. NUMBER COMMENTS US ARE STONE JUST CURIOUS HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING HELD OVER. I DON'T HAVE THE PRECISE FIGURE IN FRONT OF ME BUT IT'S WELL UNDER TEN MILLION. TEN MILLION WELL UNDER THAT OKAY. IF I HAD TO GUESS I WOULD TELL YOU. FOR COLLEGE EYES FOR NOT HAVING THE EXACT NUMBER I BELIEVE IN THE A LOCAL SYSTEM STABLES IT'S ROUGHLY AROUND TWO POINT SEVEN A THREE MILLION. IT'S THE THE THE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT BY COUNTY IS MOVING FORWARD SO WE KNOW IT'S I COULDN'T EVEN ACCURATE TO DAY BUT I BELIEVE WITH ALL ITS. BUDGET GEN THREE MILLION OKAY THANK YOU THERE'S A CLAIMING LIKE TO APOLOGIES WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE MAKE MAKE WITH CW THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN AND SENATOR STONE WE SUPPORT THE TECHNICAL CHANGE BUT ONE UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL EXPIRE -- SOMETIME EARLY IN THE BUDGET YEAR BECAUSE IT WAS NOT -- RE AUTHORIZED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IT'S A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO PARENTS. WHO'VE MET ALL THE COURTS OBLIGATIONS TO GET THEIR CHILDREN BACK -- WHO THEY LOST A FOSTER CARE BUT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE STABLE HOUSING? AND SO THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM WAS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BY PROVIDING HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE. WE CAN SAFELY REUNIFY KIDS WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND NOT HAVE THEM GROWING UP IN FOSTER CARE. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING AND FOR AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IT CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE. TO PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF HOUSING ASSISTANCE THAN TO PAY A STRANGER FOSTER PARENT. AB SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH SO THAT THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT IS ONE WHERE THE COUNTIES PUT UP A 50% MATCH THE STATE PUTS UP THE OTHER MATCH. AND THEY'RE TWELVE COUNTIES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC THERE BEEN A THOUSAND KIDS HAVE BEEN HOT. HOUSED SAFELY IN ANOTHER THOUSAND FAMILIES ON THE WAIT LIST WE ARE SURPRISED AND CONCERNED. THAT ABSENT AN ACTION OF THE LEGISLATURE THE PROGRAM WILL AND COUNT WE HAVE COUNTIES READYING. THE PROCESS OF OF WHO'VE ALREADY CLOSED ON INTAKE -- BUT EVENTUALLY THE PROGRAM -- AND COMPLETELY EARLY IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO WE'RE ASKING FOR AT LEAST ON A ONE TIME BASIS. AT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT AND DEMONSTRATE -- THE LONG TERM -- THE SORT OF VALUE OF THE PROGRAM AND POINT OUT THAT THAT THAT THAT THE SAVINGS IN THE BACK. A CREW TO ALL SORTS OF SYSTEMS THE COURTS. THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM MEDICAL SYSTEMS AND SO. IT'S NOT EASY JUST TO SAY HEY COUNTIES IF THIS IS A GOOD THING YOU SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE LOTS OF OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE COUNTY SYSTEMS. GET THE BENEFIT OF OF THE REFORM SO WE WOULD REALLY ASK AS YOU PUT THE FINAL BUDGET TOGETHER IF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION CAN COME TOGETHER AND KEEP THIS REALLY VALUABLE PROGRAM A LIFE. OKAY THANK YOU. ARE ANY INCOME SO I HEAR A FINE WITHDOING THIS BUT WE REALLY SHOULD BE FUNDING. THE SHOULD NOT BE THE LAST BIT OF MONEY. YES THE DRY SEASON. WAS IT A QUOTE SORRY PUT THEIR RESCUE MISSION I GLOW I GUESS I GUESS OF SORRY I MEAN I GUESS THE ISSUE IS IS THAT CLOSELY MEL GAME OBJECTS OF THIS PARTICULAR PART ABOUT STANDING. THE DELF CONSUMING TH ROLLING OVER THE MONEY BUT THE REAL ISSUE OBVIOUSLY BEING A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY IS IS THAT. THE PROGRAM OVERALLS NOT BEING IS AT LEAST ALSO SAY. WITHOUT BEING PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED -- ANY FURTHER CORRECT DISTRICTS TO THE THE THE PROGRAM IS ORIGINALLY THREE OUR PILOTS RIGHT -- AND THE IDEA WAS TO COME BACK AND SEE WHAT COMES FROM THE PILOT -- YOU WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO ANALYZE THE DATA AND EVERYTHING GOING FORWARD AT THE TIME -- GIVENS BUDGET WE'RE PROPOSING -- THE RECOGNITION REAR PREPARATION THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS HAD BEEN SPENT YET. NOW THERE'S BEEN OF OF THE TH SINCE THE THREE YEARS AGAIN NOW THAT I CAN IS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THOSE DOLLARS OUT THIS LAST YEAR -- BUT WE LOOKED AT THE LET'S FOLLOW UP WITH THAT THE GUNNERS ALSO MADE -- ARE PROPOSING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS ON HOMELESSNESS -- THROUGHOUT THEIR THE REST THE BUDGETS -- SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THIS PERSPECTIVES COMING AS TO LOOK AND SEE HOW THE PROJECT IS IN AND DOING BUT ALSO -- ACKNOWLEDGING ALL THE OTHER INVESTMENTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING AND HOMELESSNESS THROUGHOUT HIS BUDGET. SO I GET BECAUSE THE QUESTION I HAVE THEN IS THE SO IS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE SO WE HAVE A THREE YEAR PILOT MIKE ANY PILOT I ASSUME WE HAVE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DATA -- THE RESULTS WE HER PREVIOUS TESTIMONY HERE THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL. THE GOVERNOR'S ACTUALLY LEADERSHIP ON HOMELESSNESS AND TO INVESTING. THE MONEY OF THAT -- YES THIS IS THAT IS THERE A CONCERN THAT -- THAT THE PILOTS FOR NOT SUCCESSFUL FROM ADMINISTRATION TWENTY VIEW OR DO YOU FEEL THAT THE OTHER INVESTMENTS N HOMELESS THIS IS KENDALL SUBSTITUTE FOR THIS PROGRAM I'M JUST TRYING TO CELLS. YEAH I PRE AGAIN I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING A SIGNIFICANT VESTED IN DEALING WITH HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS I APPRECIATE THAT. IS ONE KNOW HOW THAT INTERFACES WITH THIS PROGRAM OR THE ENDING OF THIS PROGRAM. I THINK THAT THE SIMPLE RESPONSE. ACKNOWLEDGING ONE THAT IT WAS A PILOTS RIGHT YEAH I NEED TO TO AT LEAST EVALUATE THE DATA RIGHT HAVE TIME TO EVALUATE AND SEE WITH -- HOW EVERYTHING WORKED WITH THE CHALLENGES THIS SUCCESSES OR WITH THAT BUT THEN AGAIN JUST A COLLEGE IN THAT -- THE GOVERNOR'S PRIVATIZED A MUCH BROADER HOMELESSNESS INVESTMENT THERE IS IS BUDGET SO -- RECOGNIZING THAT THE THE THE PILOT SENDING THERE ARE SUCCESS IS GOING ON WITH THAT THAT'S WHY WERE RECOMMEND OR REQUESTING THE REVERBERATION OF ANY UNSPENT FUNDS. BUT THEN -- UTILIZING POTENTIALLY UTILIZING ANY OF THE ADDITIONAL HOMELESSNESS FUNDING THAT'S INCLUDE IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE. I I I GET THAT THAT MAY NOT PROVIDE. A EIGHT SO I GUESS ONE THAT AND SO. I GUESS WHAT I WANT BY TRANTOR STAND IS IS THAT -- AND DALY AYE AYE YEAH ON BIG PROPONENT FOR EVALUATION SO -- THAT THAT IS KIND OF INTERESTING YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS PILOT AND THEN WE'RE GONNA. YEAH I'LL TAKE SOME TIME TO DO EVALUATION SO WE'RE GONNA AND IT ESSENTIALLY IN. BENSALEM A LOOK AT THE DATA SO WE THANK YOU HAVE A GAP -- BUT ALSO ADDRESS THINGS LIKE WELL IT OF I GUESS THE QUESTION HERE IS IS THAT. HOW DOES? THIS PROGRAM WHICH WILL BE ENDING WHICH IS A PILOT YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S A THREE YEAR PILOT. SO THE MONEY AND AND AND SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT WHAT WE HAVE SOME REMAINING MONEY THAT STILL LEFT IN A WILL THAT BUT THEN WHEN. I CHECKED OUT HOW THE INTERFACE WITH THE REST OF WITH WITH THE GOVERNOR'S AGENDA ON ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND AGAIN I WANTED KNOWLEDGE THE GOVERNOR'S PUTTING A VERY SUBSTANTIAL AND AND SERIOUS EFFORT AT DOING THIS. I'M JUST THINKING LIKE WE HAVE A PILOT THAT I'M HEARING IS BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL [inaudible] SO. WE'RE GONNA IT ENDED SO WHAT'S THE PICK UP FROM THAT OR WE SIMPLY SAYING WE'RE ENDING AT THIS AND FOR DOING SOMETHING ELSE SO I GUESS THAT'S THAT IS THOSE ARE AN INTENTION TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FOLD. THIS THAT THE WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THIS PILOT IN THE SUCCESS OF FROM THIS PILOT SOME SORT OF FORM CONTINUITY BEYOND JUST SIMPLY CONTINUING TO REAPPROPRIATION BEYOND THAT LIKE HOW HOW OF IT IS THERE'S GONNA BE SOME. OFF BRAND THE LEASE ON ON RAMP AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM OR IS THIS LIKE OKAY WELL THIS PILOT AND IT'S DONE SO. THIS WOULD JUST EVERYTHING IS FINISHED AND NOW WILL WILL RUN THE NUMBERS AND SEE HOW IT TURNED OUT. AND MAYBE WILL CONSIDER RESTARTING IT IN A YEAR OF A TERMS OF WEED SIZE SENSIBLE ARE NOT ARE IT IS OR IS THERE A SPECIFIC. PLAN. TO ON RAMP THIS INTO THE LARGER HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM. TO THEIR I WOULD SAY THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT PLANS INCLUDE THIS INTO THE HOMELESS PROGRAM -- IT'S A THAT COUNTY SAN UTILIZE SHOULD BE A KEY IF IF IF NEED BE THERE THANKS TO SO THEY CAN UTILIZE SOME OF THE INFORMATION. OR SUCCESSES THAT THEY'VE LEARNED FROM THAT AND ENGINE LEVERAGE SOME OF THOSE OTHER DOLLARS A RESUME A LOT OF THIS IS RELATED TO LEARN TO REALIGN PROGRAMS AND IT'S A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH THROUGH -- THROUGH COUNTY AND STATE SO -- THERE'S NOTHING PROHIBITING COUNTIES TO CONTINUE ON WITH WITH A LOT OF THE SUCCESSES -- WE CAN CONTINUE ON THE PROGRAM THEMSELVES -- TO THE EXTENT THAT MAYBE THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES NOT TO PROPOSE ANYTHING ON THINGS IN THE GOVERNOR HASN'T PROPOSED ANYTHING ANIME REVISION -- BUT I'D AT THE SIDE THERE'S THERE'S NO. THERE THERE ISN'T A PROPOSAL TO EXTEND -- THE PROGRAM SO CAN WE TAKE SAM'S CAN WE CAN CAN COUNTIES USE SOME OF THE MONIES ARE BEING ALLOCATED BY THE GOVERNOR TOWARD. CONTINUING THE PROGRAM IN ACCOUNTING HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT SPECIFIC IS AYE AYE I'M NOTS I HAVE A COLLEAGUE HERE AT THE MOMENT THAT. INFORMATION OKAY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. MIGHT CONSIDER THE COUNTY SAYS HEY IT'S WE GOT SOME PRETTY GOOD RESULTS THAT THERE'S A WAY THE CHANNELS THAT YOU KNOW THERE AGAIN AND ALLOCATION FOR HOWEVER. IT'S OUR IT'S FINE NO THAT'S BEING HEARD A DIFFERENT SUBCOMMITTEE BUT THAT THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO TAP SOME OF THAT MONEY TO SAY WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO RUN OUR COUNTY PROGRAM THIS. THIS ACTIVITY IN THE THAT THE OKAY TO USE THOSE FUNDS I I CAN LOOK INTO OKAY MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK AT OUR STAFF I DON'T KNOW AND OKAY. SELECT YOU CAN JUST ON ONE MOMENT AND DON'T -- DID ANY COMES FROM LA ON THAT. WE WILL BE HAPPY TO HELP WITH ANY OF THESE ISSUES I THINK ONE THING THAT WE DID REYES AND OUR ANALYSIS IN JANUARY WAS THAT THERE IS A PROPOSAL. TO AUGMENT THE HOUSING AND DISABILITY THE H. DOT PROGRAM FOR IT THE SSI RECIPIENT -- AND THAT PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY NOT SET TO EXPIRE IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO THIS IS A FUNDING ON TOP OF THE THREE YEAR FUNDING THAT WAS ORIGINALLY -- PROVIDED SO WE DID RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT COMPARED TO THIS PROGRAM AND PERHAPS THERE COULD BE SOME FUNDING IF IF YOU WERE TO PRIORITIZE THE AND THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME. PROJECT HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON H. STOP IN IS THERE SOME SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE. YES JOINT BACKED UP AND IF I COULD I DECIDED TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA IS FINANCE ALLEGHENY CHANCE. THAT US I DID YOU I SAY SOMETHING YEAH I AND I JUST I I THINK SPECIFICALLY IF -- IF THERE WAS A AND FUNDED THAT WE NEED TO GO TO THE BRING FAMILIES HOME. PROGRAM I THINK THAT HAVE TO SPECIFICALLY BE AUGMENTED BY THE LEGISLATURE AT THIS POINT THAT OKAY. TO SAY THAT THEY WANT X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS TO GO TOWARDS OUR HOGAN FOR ANYTHING. OKAY MR MECCA. WE WOULD THAT WE KNOW THE DEPARTMENT IS GATHERING DATA FROM THE THE PILOT AND AND THERE WAS A RAMP UP PERIOD BECAUSE IT WAS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM AND SO. OPERATIONALLY TO ASK THE COUNTIES TO CLOSE THE PROGRAM DOWN. THEN HAVE DSS COMPLETE A PILOT THEM PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IF YOU DECIDED HEY THIS IS GREAT WE REALLY LIKE TO DO IT. THEN WE'D HAVE TO RESTART PROGRAMS THAT WE ADJUST. RAMP DOWN AND OPERATIONALLY WE CAN'T OPERATE THAT WAY THAT'S NOT A VIABLE WAY TO OPERATE AND FROM THE STANDPOINT OF USING. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S HOMELESSNESS RESOURCES WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT SOME SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF THAT GOES TO CITIES WHO DON'T HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FOSTER CARE PROGRAM. I'M A FOSTER PARENTS NEED IS IMMEDIATELY RENTAL ASSISTANCE FIRST AND LAST MONTH THE ABILITY TO MAKE OUR MODIFICATIONS TO THEIR HOME. THAT SOMETHING THEY NEED THEY NEED RIGHT NOW AND TO SORT OF SAY GO INTO THE LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS FOR THE PORTION OF THE FUNDS THAT MIGHT BE USABLE FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE. IT'S A GAMBIT AND IT WILL TAKE TIME AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL KEEP THE PROGRAMS ALIVE. OKAY ALL RIGHT -- CONCUR WITH YOUR COMMONSENSE. IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE WE'RE PULLING ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE WAVE AFTER WE'VE BEEN PUTTING THESE FAMILIES TOGETHER SO THEY CAN AFFORD -- DOLING UNIT. TEN I DON'T SEE ANY RAMPING DOWN AND AND THE WAY THIS CORNER NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR EXISTING PUBLICIST PROBLEMS SO -- IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME WE WILL OF COURSE WE'D LIKE TO SEE A REPORT BACK BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT -- SEGREGATION OF FUNDS AND AND WE ARE GOING TO BE EXACERBATING ARE HOMELESS PROBLEM IN OUR OUR DESIRE TO UNITE FOSTER USE WITH THEIR FAMILIES IF WE JUST PULL THE CARPET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THIS PROGRAM. HE SAID THERE'S ROUGHLY MAYBE THREE MILLION DOLLARS LEFT. BUT WHAT'S BEEN A BURN RATE -- DURING THE CITY OR PER YEAR. TWO AT THE TIME THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE IS -- SIX ONE SEVEN MILLION ON SPENDS IN JANUARY SO THE THE PILOT BEGAN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO THE BURN RATE BEEN PRETTYLOW -- SO THAT'S WEEKEND WHEN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL CAME ACROSS FROM THE GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IT WAS THE INTENT THAT THE WAY THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING THAT THERE MIGHT BE WARM MORE FUNDING THAN THERE IS NOW THE TIME TO CARRY OVER OKAY THEN I MIGHT ASK THE WITH THE WITH US IF AND IF IT IS MY COME BACK UP TO THE MICROPHONE. HE MADE A REQUEST FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE -- ESTIMATING THAT WE NEED IN A YEAR WHEN HISTORICALLY WE HAVEN'T SPENT THAT KIND OF MONEY ARE YOU LOOKING. FOR THIS IS A MULTI YEAR -- ALLOCATION SO THE SO TWO THINGS FIRST THIS IS THE RAMP UP PERIOD SO YOU CAN'T LOOK AT SORT OF YOU CAN'T PROJECT FROM ONE CORNER TO THE NEXT. A PROGRAM LIKE THIS THAT WE'VE RAISED IN THE PAST THE TRAJECTORY IS. EXPONENTIAL AND SO WE SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT BY THIS POINT THERE WOULDN'T BE THAT MUCH MONEY LEFT WE'RE WE'VE ASKED FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION WHICH IS AN INCREASE OVER THAT THE ORIGINAL AMOUNT. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO ADD MORE COUNTIES BECAUSE ONLY TWELVE COUNTIES KOMMER DISSIPATE ALLOW EXISTING COUNTIES TO MEET THE THOUSAND PERSON BACKLOG SO WE WE HAVE ASKED THE LEGISLATURE. FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM. IT'S THE SAME TRAJECTORY IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE TRAJECTORY THAT YOU GUYS. PUT FORTH FOR THE CHARACTERS HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM UPON WHICH BE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME WAS BASED. YOU SAW THE ORIGINAL FOURTEEN COUNTIES YOU LIKE THE RESULTS AND YOU ADDED MONEY SO THAT MORE COUNTIES COULD PARTICIPATE. AND WE WERE HOPING THAT BRINGING FAMILIES HOME WOULD FOLLOW THE SAME PATTERN. THANKS FOR THE DANCERS RESEARCH HERE THIS IS -- A VERY WORTHY -- ENDEAVOR AND I DO IT ONE THOUSAND FAMILY WAIT AND WE ONLY HAVE TWELVE COUNTIES IN THE STATE THAT ARE PARTICIPATING AND WE WANT. TO TO AUGMENT OUR FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAM AND REDUCE HOMELESSNESS IS SEEMS LIKE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WE WE CALL BUDGET DOES WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE -- RECOMMENDATION TO PUT BACK INTO THE BUDGET TO NINETY STARTED OUT FOR YOU AND SENATOR D'AMATO TO THE CONCERT I WAS CERTAINLY SUPPORTED IF WE DECIDED. TO PUT IT BACK. YES PLEASE THANK YOU JUST WANNA MAKE ONE CORRECTION IDEOLOGIES THAT ARE SEVEN THAT -- FOR THE TIME PERIOD TO BRING HIM HOME CERTAIN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN SIR. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING. OKAY WELL -- I I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- FIRST OF ALL -- I APPRECIATE AGAIN GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIZATION OF HOUSING AND SO AND INVESTMENT SEIZE PROPOSING TO MAKE IN THE MAY REVISE SO I'D I DON'T WANT TO DETRACT FROM THAT AND ANYWAY -- I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT -- IN SOME WAYS THERE MAY BE A DESIRE TO TRY. TO YOU KNOW NOT HAVE LOTS OF LITTLE PROGRAMS BUT TRY TO CONSOLIDATE. IN SOMEWAY OR TRY TO DO EVEN TOGETHER SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY A STRATEGY RATE SO IT'S NOT JUST LIKE WILLOW PROGRAM LOW PROGRAM HERE CENTER -- BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT I THINK THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ACT AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF FOSTER USEAND ALSO. AT LEAST. TENTATIVELY I REALIZE YOU'RE STILL DOING SOME OF THE VALUATION BUT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GETTING SOME VERY PROMISING RESULTS -- I A HOPE THAT WE CAN. IN THE FINAL BUDGET WE HAVE A WAY OF YEAH WE COULD EITHER SUPPORT IN THE FAMILY CERTAINLY CAN PROPOSE ON THE LEGISLATURE -- BUT IF DESIRED Là WORK AT THE MINISTRATION TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD FIT INTO THE LARGER TEAM WITHOUT LOSING THE GAINS THAT WE'VE MADE IN THIS PROGRAM -- AND ALSO SINCE AS A PILOT AND AGAIN IF YOU COME BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS REALLY ARE THAT THINK THAT GOOD THAT'S ONE THING. BUT I THINK THAT -- WE WE HAVE YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE FAMILIES WE HAVE FOSTER KIDS SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE -- SO THE SAYS IT'S A MULTIPLE WHEN IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE HOUSE IT'S ALSO ABOUT GETTING KIDS SEE WILL HOMES AND HELPING FAMILIES. THERE'S A WAY TO INCORPORATE HOW HOW THIS FITS INTO THE GAL GOVERNOR'S HOUSING STRATEGY BE SURE WE TAKE CARE OF THIS POPULAR AND INTO THE GOVERNOR TENDS TO THIS IS NOT SEEN THE GOVERNOR OF PLANNING. TO BUT A TO BUILD ON WHAT WE ALREADY LEARNED FOR THIS PILOT AND WE'RE VERY SPENT THREE YEARS INVESTING IN IT. HOW WE CAN BUILD ON WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THIS PILOT NOT DISCONTINUE -- WHAT THAT JUST SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE PROGRAM AND THINK ABOUT HOW THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO WHETHER? THAT'S A LARGER PROGRAM RIGHT NOW OR WE HAVE TO SAY WILL KEEP IT GOING SEPARATELY AND THEN BUT FIGURE OUT HOW IT FITS INTO THIS LARGER PICTURE CELL. I HATE IT HATE TO LOSE WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GAIN WITH THIS PROGRAM AGAIN IF THE VALUATION SHOWS DIFFERENTLY PLEASE SHARE THAT WITH ME AS WELL AND I WANT I DON'T IMGINE. INVESTING IN UNSUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS ARE INEFFECTIVE ONCE BUT UNTIL THAT'S BEEN SHOWN A FOR EFFORT A LOT OF TESTIMONY THAT THIS IS BEEN VERY HELPFUL SO I'M HOPING WE CAN. FIGURE THAT OUT [inaudible] SOUNDS GOOD. I REALIZE THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO RUN IT UP THE CHAIN SOMEWHERE. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU AND AT AN INDIAN PERSPECTIVE APARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. I THINK WE WOULD LARGELY AGREE I WOULD SAY IT'S TWELVE HUNDRED KIDS SERVE SO FAR AND REUNITED NOT -- ONE THOUSAND YEP. I'M HERE FOR YOU OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY NINE A AND A NEW YEAH YOU PARTY MINISTRATION SO I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO BUT I MEAN I THINK AGAIN IT'S JUST IF THE RESULTS ARE GOOD. HE SHOULD. ALONG WITH THEIR FAMILIES ON A POLICY RIGHT ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS YES NOW AND AND AND AND AND AND I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AROUND THE CHILDREN FAMILY SO. OKAY THANK YOU.

WOULD BE SUSTAINABLE ONCE THEY RECEIVE THE DISABILITY BENEFITS -- IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING HAS IS MADE THAT A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION -- SO WE'RE WE'RE PROPOSING TO TO RELIEVE THAT REQUIREMENT -- IN IN THE TRAILER BILL ADDITIONALLY AS MENTIONED IN YOUR AGENDA -- TRIBES WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE LANGUAGES ELIGIBLE GRANT RECIPIENTS OR IN TERMS OF CONSULTATION ABOUT THE PROGRAM THE WAY THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN -- IN THE BEGINNING -- SO ADDING THEM -- INTO THE STATUTE IN ALL THE PLACES THAT THEY NEEDTO BE -- IS ANOTHER AND THERE'S ALSO SOME LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS ASSISTANCE WITH THE DISABILITY APPLICATION TO BE SEPARATE FROM THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE.

AS A RESULT OF PEOPLE ENJOYING IT SO MUCH -- FINDING IT USEFUL SO MUCH UTILIZATION HAS GONE UP AND SO THE COST OF THE CONTRACT IS INCREASED AND THAT'S THE THE REQUEST FOR THE FUNDING INCREASE THAT YOU SEE HERE. AND WE'VE PULLED IT OUT OF THE COUNTY -- CAL WORKS CONTRACTS LINES AND CREATED ITS OWN LINE ITEM IN OUR BUDGET FOR FOR THIS-CONTRACT. K. L. L. QUESTIONS FINANCE. MEMBERS OF THE JUST SO. SO THESE ARE REPRESENTING INCREASES HOW SO HOW MUCH IS THE CONTRACT -- FACSIMILE. THIS PARTICULAR CONTRACT I BELIEVE IS AROUND TWO POINT SIX A YEAR -- IT WE TEND TO SIGN ON A MULTI YEAR BASIS I WANT TO SAY THE TOTAL CONTRACT IS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIVE AND A HALF TO SIX OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD. OKAY ALL RIGHT THE OBSERVE I SEE IS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN INCREASE OF ABOUT TWO ONE POINT NINE MILLION FOR ONE LINE ITEM ANOTHER ONE FOR TWO POINT TWO MILLION SO I MEAN THIS IS A SO THIS WOULD BE WHAT IT LIKE A 30%. INCREASE FEES THE USE I'M JUST TRYING TO GET HOW MUCH HOW MUCH OF AN INCREASE IS THIS. WHAT WE ARE FULLY A DOUBLING OF ROUGHLY DOUBLE OF WHAT THE HISTORICAL CONTRACTED BUDGET FOR IT HAS BEEN? OKAY YES FINANCE THE JOIN. CLARIFICATIONS ARE DISMAYED. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO BASICALLY SO IT'S IS THIS SAYS A DOUBLING OF HOW MUCH BECAUSE OF THE VERY HIGH UTILIZATION. RIGHT SO IT'S JUST A CURIOSITY WELL NOT -- SO. THE IS THE HIGH UTILIZATION OF THIS INFORMATION IS THAT GONNA HELP RESULT I MEAN THIS DATABASE PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION IS IMPROVED EFFICIENCY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. GOING THROUGH THE ELIGIBILITY IS IT SELLERS ARE IS OUR INVESTMENT IN IN THIS ACTUALLY ALSO MAKING A WORKERS MORE EFFICIENT OR RAINY SOMEWAY ITS THE REDUCING COSTS ARE SAVING MONEY IN SOME WAY. WE DIDN'T MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO SCORE ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS ACHIEVED BY THIS BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT DOES IT PROVIDES MORE REAL TIME DATA. AND SO W'RE GETTING A MORE TIMELY INFORMATION FOR FOR THE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION PROCESS AS WELL AS THE BENEFIT CALCULATION PROCESS IS USED IN BOTH CAL WORKS AND CAL FRESH PROGRAM. OKAY AND AND ACTUALLY FROM A CLIENT PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW NOT HAVING TO REMEMBER TO BRING IN PAY STUBS OR HAVE TO MAKE REPEAT TRIPS BACK IN THE DOCUMENT MANAGING SIDE OF IT WE WE VIEW THIS AS AN EFFICIENCY DESPITE AFFECT WE'VE ONLY BUDGET AT THE COST OF THE CONTRACT. OKAY SO HOPEFULLY THAN THIS THIS WILL HELP. MAKE THINGS MORE EFFICIENT FOR THE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS AND ACTION SO I GUESS ANOTHER QUESTION IS IS THAT EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT HOW. YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA INVEST IN THE COMPUTER HOW OF AND TRY TO BRING ALL THE ELIGIBILITY STUFF TOGETHER. DO WE SEE INCORPORATING THE THE DE SER DATABASES LIKE THIS IN TO THAT KIND OF A SYSTEM SO THAT -- THE SAID THIS CANDIDATE IS MORE READILY AVAILABLE TO ELIGIBILITY WORKERS AND DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY -- THIS PART OF THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY. ACROSS ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE OBVIOUSLY EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION IS IMPORTANT -- BOTH FOR YOU KNOW ELIGIBILITY PURPOSES AS WELL AS MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH WELFARE TO WORK PLANNED RIGHT HAVING THAT NO MORE TIMELY THAT YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION. ARE YES WHETHER IT'S IN THE SPECIFIC SERVICE WITH THIS COMPANY I COULDN'T TELL YOU BUT EARNINGS INFORMATION AND EMPLOYMENT STATUS IS VITAL. OKAY. YES WE OPERATE A SAID THE AND IT COULD BE DUE TO THIS OR SOME BUT THAT THAT'S THE SHORTHAND IS DOWN CORPORATION YES SOME SOME SIR SERVICE TO GET THAT INFORMATION OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO WE CAN'T SO BETWEEN EDT AND OTHER FOLKS WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY COLLECTED OURSELVES OR WAIT THEY REALIZE THEY ALL HAVE YOU SEE SOME PRIVATE COMPANIES MORE EFFICIENT BUT AND WE WE DO IN FACT USE EDT DATA TODAY IN THE PROGRAM WE JUST FIND THAT -- IT TENDS TO HAVE A DATE A LACK OF OF OF REPRESSION AT LEAST THREE MONTHS INSTEAD OF TWO OKAY WEEKS OF THIS THE SPONSOR A ACCURATE MORE TODAY OKAY. ALRIGHT. OKAY ANY OTHER -- QUESTIONS PUBLIC COMMENT OKAY SEEING NONE. IT WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AS WELL ALL RIGHT RESEARCHER FOCUS TO THESE TO KIND OF SNIDE COMMENTS NOT NECESSARILY RELATED TO ITEMS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY BUT OKAY WOULD APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. ON THE RECORD -- AS AS YOU EXPERIENCE THROUGH THROUGH THE HEARINGS WE'VE HAD THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE -- AND WE SIMPLY WANT TO GO ON THE RECORD THAT IT TAKES PEOPLE TO GET THINGS DONE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S A FINAL PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES SOME MORE MANY OR VIRTUALLY NINE BUT WHATEVER THAT FINAL PACKAGE LOOKS LIKE. A WE'D LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO TALK ABOUT THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ACTUALLY AFFECTION WAIT ANY OF THE PROPOSALS AND ULTIMATELY GOT FUNDED. HEY ON A ON A SECOND NOTE IN AND PERHAPS RELATED TO THE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR ITEM -- BUT OTHERS AS WELL -- THAT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER -- IN OUR EFFORTS TO CONSOLIDATE THE THE SALAS SYSTEMS -- THAT'S A MAJOR I. T. EFFORT AND SUCKED UP A LOT OF THE I. T. PLANNING BAND WITH. AND SO IN ALL THE ADVOCATE FEEDBACK THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO THEM ON A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BASIS ON ANY LEGISLATION THAT'S MOVING IN THE LEGISLATURE -- WE WERE MAKING THE GENERIC COMMENT -- THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THINGS CAN'T BE FIT INTO THE I. T. KIND OF PIPELINE IF YOU WILL OR THE THE KIND OF TO DO LIST. IN A TIMELY MANNER CONSIDERATION EITHER SHOULD BE TO ADJUSTING IMPLEMENTATION DATES FOR THOSE ITEMS TO ALIGN WITH WHAT CAN BE AUTOMATED OR CONSIDER MANUAL -- WORK AROUNDS AND AND FINDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE COST OF THOSE ACTIVITIES AND OTHER SUCH THINGS OR APPROPRIATING MONEY FOR THAT PURPOSE AND PERHAPS GET MAKING THAT MONEY AVAILABLE ON A MULTI YEAR BASIS. SO I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD WITH SHARING SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS SOME CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM ARE EASIER A CHANGE TO A CAL WORKS GRANT REPLACES NUMBERS ON A TABLE AND DOESN'T REQUIRE PROGRAMMING. BUT NEW BENEFITS OR NEW NEW PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES -- DIFFERENT THINGS REQUIRE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTOMATION AND SO WE JUST WANT TO BE ON THE ECORD. WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY SURPRISED IF WE SAY WE CAN'T DO IT FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS. IT MAY BE BECAUSE THE PROGRAMMING IS REALLY COMPLEX THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN WE DON'T THINK IT CAN OR SHOULD BE DONE IT JUST MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE DONE IN THE YEAR IN WHICH EVERYBODY WANTS IT TO BE DONE. OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY THAT STATEMENT -- AND I RECOGNIZE SO WE HAVE WE TALKED ABOUT WE HAVE THIS BIG SAWS INTEGRATION PROJECT AS AN END TO WHAT. TWENTY TWENTY THREE THANKS GOAL SO. BEYOND MY TIME HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE -- AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME. SO AND MAYBE I'M GAS MORE SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE ISSUE ABOUT. THE CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S THE CAL FRESH AMERICAN ROMAN. ARE YOU ARE YOU SAYING THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES IN RELATION TO THAT PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS IS THAT IT'S AN THAT THE I. T. WORK THAT WOULD. BE NECESSARY TO DO THAT ISN'T. ISN'T FITTING IN WITH THE CURRENT TIMELINE. OUR VIEW AT A YOU MAY MORTGAGE ANIL STATEMENTS I'M JUST CHECKING IN WITH THAT WAS THAT ALSO APPLY TO THEIR SPECIFIC APPLICATION TO THAT. RICK THAT -- REQUEST OUR PROPOSAL THAT WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER AND I WAS SIMPLY USING THAT ONE AS AN ANALOGY I I COULDN'T SPEAK TO AND TELL YOU TODAY IT CAN'T BE DONE AND BUDGET YEAR THAT'S NOT WHAT I INTENDED TO QUE QUE WITHOUT -- BUT IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PACKAGE OF THINGS AND EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET DONE WITHIN WITHIN A CAL WORKS PROGRAM WE ALREADY KNOW WE HAVE A PROBABLY SOME CHANGES AROUND THAT THE CASH OUT POLICY IN SOME AUTOMATION OF AT LEAST THE REPORTING FUNCTIONS THERE -- YOU KNOW WE'VE PROPOSED A CALLOUS GRANT INCREASE THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OF THINGS THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE ALREADY THERE SALAS CONSOLIDATION THE MIGRATION OF THE LEADER REPLACEMENT SYSTEM TO THE CLOUD. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE PLANNED. IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND SO WE JUST WOULD SAY. WHAT CAN BE DONE DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH WANTS TO BE DONE AND WHAT THE RELATIVE PRIORITY IS? AND TO THE EXTENT WE DETERMINE. TOGETHER AND WITH THE COUNTIES IN THE CONSORTIUM WHAT THE CAPABILITY AS WE MAY WANT TO APPROPRIATE MONEY. FOR PARTICULAR THINGS BUT MAKE THAT MONEY AVAILABLE FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS INSTEAD OF JUST ONE YEAR SO SO I THE VISIT. OKAY SO I GUESS ONE THING IN RELATION TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IS GONNA BE -- THE I APPRECIATE. THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGES OF DOING A VERY LARGE SYSTEM RIGHT AND EVERY TIME WE MAKE A CHANGE HERE SOMEBODY HAS TO PROGRAM SOMETHING THERE -- I GUESS WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY SO WELL WE WANT A KNOWLEDGE AND KEEP THAT IN MIND AS HE SAID PRIORITIES. WE DON'T WANT THE COMPUTER SYSTEM ENTIRELY DRIVING ALL OUR PRIORITIES SO BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THAT INVOLVED AYE IS THERE A COMMUNICATION. BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT AND LA -- ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE THE COMPLEXITIES OF OF OF THESE THINGS I MEAN THAT THAT SOME SENSES. AT FIRST I I A AND I AND I TRUST EVERYONE HEARS ACTING AND SHOULDN'T IN GOOD FAITH AND EVERYONE THEN THIS IS AT AND I KNOW EVERYONE'S VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT BEING SURE WE SERVICE SERVICES AT THE THEY'RE BEING SERVED -- I JUST. ALSO WANT TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS THAT -- THAT WE DON'T MAKE THE COMPUTER SYSTEM HAS INTEGRATION AN EXCUSE NOT TO DO SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE DOING -- SO SITES MY COMMENT IN AN AND I ENDED UP I WAS MERELY SUGGESTING THE NEED FOR A CONVERSATION -- RIGHT SO SO THE AUTOMATED MAYBE THERE'S MENU RIGHT WORK AROUND SO SO WHAT IT'S ALL IS I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS AND FOR AND AND AGAIN AMERICA AND I SAID I HATE I TRUSTS THAT. YOUR GOALS WE ARE SHARING THE SAME GOALS. WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE RIGHT BUT I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO BE HELPFUL THEN IS THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME YOU KNOW BE SURE THERE'S THE LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY SO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE SAY. WELL THIS IS GONNA BE CHALLENGING TO PROGRAM INTO OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM. THEN. WE NEED ARE THEY WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ALEJO NEEDS TO KNOW LIKE OKAY WELL IF IT DOES ABOUT PRIORITIES THEN WE NEED TO KNOW LIKE WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE BAND THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PROGRAM. AND WHERE AND AND SO THAT WE HAVE A SAY IN TWO WHICH WHAT WE THINK ARE THOSE PRIORITIES TOO SO I'M SURE THE PROGRAMMERS AND SO FORTH ALREADY HAVE A SET OUR PRIORITIES BASED ON AND STAKEHOLDERS BUT WERE ALSO A VERY IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDER SO. IF IT IF THAT'S GOING TO BE THE REASON THAT WELL WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS NOW BECAUSE OF THE HEART PROGRAM THE OF TO TELL US LIKE OKAY WELL THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO AND IF WE DID DO THIS NOW WHAT WE GET BUMPED. OFF A WHAT WE GET BUMPED LATER SO WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL TRADE OFFS ARE NOT SIMPLY THAT. WELL THIS IS GONNA BE KIND OF HARD TO DO SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE NEED THAT LEVEL TRANSPARENCY TO UNDERSTAND THE I GUESS THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY DECISION WE MAKE ME. WE MAY CHOOSE TO DO THOUGH THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BY THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THAT PRIORITY THAT'S FINE THAT'S THE NORMAL PROCESS WE ALWAYS HAVE. BUT I THINK I AM AND IT AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH BECAUSE I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR DIALOGUE -- AND DURING THESE BUDGET HEARINGS -- I KNOW THEY'RE NOT DONE YET AND FORGET APPRECIATE ACTUALLY YOUR PASSION AND OPENNESS TO THINKING ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP THE FAMILY SIDE NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT NOR FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I YOU KNOW I'M I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BIG COMPUTER SYSTEM THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS WE GOTTA KEEP THE THING GOING WE KNOW WHAT THE THING BEING HELD UP FOR YEARS. AND DECADES IS AT ONCE LIKE DOING STUFF BUT WE NEED TO BE PART OF THAT IS WORTH CONSIDERING POLICIES WHICH THEN WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. WE NEED TO KNOW OKAY WE MAKE THAT POLICY CHANGE WHAT IMPACT DOES IT HAVE ON THE COMPUTER IF THAT'S THE REASON WHY THERE'S RELUCTANCE. TO DO IT BECAUSE WELL IT'S GOING TO SLOW DOWN ITS -- THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT LEVELS TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE THEN WHAT CASE WERE PART OF THAT DECISION MAKING RIGHT OKAY WE KNOW THE TRADE OFF IS IS THAT MEANS WE BOUGHT SOMETHING ELSE OFF THAT WE THE PEOPLE WANT TO DO. WE MAKE THAT DEAL YEAR LATER IF WE DO THAT WE NEED TO SITE THAT'S WHAT IS WHAT WE WANTED. TO RIGHT THAT BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION BUT WE WON'T KNOW THAT UNLESS YOU TELL US. HOW THAT WORKS THAT MAKES SENSE? THE WAY WE MANAGE THE PROJECT WE HAVE A ROAD MAP TO LIST OUT ALL THE FORTHCOMING PLAN CHANGES IN WHICH RELEASES AND SO FORTH AND WE CAN BE TRANSPARENT WITH THAT RIGHT SO I SAY AGAIN. YEAH IT IT TO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR WE CAN PROVIDE THAT AND WE JUST WANTED TO SUGGESTED DIALOGUE. I REALLY DIDN'T WANT THAT INTERPRETED AS SO WE CAN'T DO IT AND THEN AND THEN AND I'M THAT'S NOT WHAT I KNOW THEY SAY AND I KNOW THAT YOU GOT THAT. RIGHT SO IN IT AND I THINK YOU KNOW. LA AS OUR TECHNICAL ARE ON THIS IS SO IT'S IMORTANT AT THERE'S TIME GOING COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW AND BELIEVE ME I AM. AND AND IT ALSO AND AT IT AND I REALLY YOU KNOW -- INVESTED IN BEING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST QUALITY SERVICE AND DELIVERY AND PART OF THAT'S HAVING A VERY WELL WORKING COMPUTER SYSTEM INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THAT DOES THAT. SO I RECOGNIZE THAT'S PART OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE LEAN AS SO WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND WHAT KIND OF VESTMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE -- SO BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T AND I KNOW YOU WON'T DO THIS BUT WE WE WE DON'T TO SIMPLY WANT TO BE TOLD WELL. IT DOESN'T FIT OUR TIME LINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF SAAS SO THEREFORE WE THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO DO THAT. RIGHT SOVIET TELL US LIKE OKAY SO WHAT IS IT I QUITE -- AND IF WE DID THIS THEN WHAT WOULD BE THE RESULTS OF THAT. RIGHT IN AN ACT IN AND AND A TRANSPARENT ACCURATE WAY SO EXACTLY APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE OF THE LAST TWO POINT NO I I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING THOSE WITH ME OKAY. ANY OTHER ITEMS.
