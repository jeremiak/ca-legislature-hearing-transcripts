ON EDUCATION FINANCE TODAY'S HEARING IS OUR HIGHER EDUCATION COMBO HEARING FOR THE UC AND CSU A SYSTEM AS ALWAYS THIS IS A- A DISTANT- HEARING A VIRTUAL HEARING SO WILL HAVE LIMITED- PARTICIPATION FROM THE PUBLIC HERE TODAY WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE LATER- FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BY CALLING IN AT THE NUMBERS ON THE AGENDA WILL BE ON THE SCREEN AND I'LL GIVE YOU THAT NUMBER- LATER IN THE AFTERNOON JUST AT THE OUTSET WITH WE DO WELL WHAT TO KNOW THAT IF WE DON'T FINISH BY NOON HOPEFULLY WE WILL BEGIN OFFICE BY NOON. WE WILL TAKE A RECESS AT NOON AND THEN- RECONVENE- BETWEEN A ONE AND ONE THIRTY DEPENDING ON WHAT TIME ARE OUR RESPECTIVE CAUCUSES AND- AGAIN. TODAY'S HEARINGS ABOUT THE UC AND CSU AND- BOTH SYSTEMS HAVE HAD BAD TO DRAMATICALLY IT ADJUST HOW THEY OPERATE IN. CERTAINLY HAD IMPACT ON STUDENTS BECAUSE OF THIS- PANDEMIC AND WE KNOW THAT. OUR STUDENTS HAVE FACED A SEVERE JOB LOSSES LOSSES- TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES HOUSING CHALLENGES- WALK CAMPUSES FACED A NEW COST AND LOST A LOT OF REVENUE RELATED TO HOUSING. AND AND PARKING BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME SOME GOOD NEWS ON THE HORIZON AND SOME GOOD NEWS THAT. RECENTLY HAPPENED THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE- THE AND THIS BODY IN THE GOVERNOR THAT- THE MEASURES THAT WE VOTED ON. THE THE MID YEAR BUDGET- COVER NINETEEN PACKAGE THAT WE- VOTED ON TWO WEEKS AGO RESTORES THE CUTS THAT WE MADE TO UC AND CSU. THAT ARE BEING BEEN THE ASK NUMBER ONE FROM THOSE TWO SEGMENTS SEGMENTS- IT SEGMENT WE'LL GET ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN ONGOING FUNDING BACK STARTING ON JULY ONE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT CONGRESS IS ON THE VERGE OF PASSING A THIRD ROUND A FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDING THAT WILL HELP ALL UNIVERSITIES- WE ANTICIPATE LATEST ROUND EXPECTED PROVIDE. ABOUT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO CALIFORNIA COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES CLEANED COMMUNICABLE **** SOME OF THAT FOR THE SEGMENT SOME OF THAT'S TO A STUDENTS FOR FINANCIAL AID WE THINK THAT YOU SEEN CSU WILL. RECEIVE AT LEAST ONE BILLION OF THAT SO WE WANT TO HEAR- SOME PRELIMINARY INSIGHT FROM THE UNIVERSITIES. UNIVERSITIES I ABOUT THE- WE ALSO KNOW THAT- OUR STUDENTS ARE STILL HURTING AND CAMPUSES ARE STILL PLANNING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IN PERSON LEARNING IN THE FALL- THIS BUDGET IS A GOOD STARTING POINT TO HELP US REFOCUS ON STUDENTS NEEDS ENSURING THAT CAMPUSES HAVE THE ADEQUATE. RESOURCES SO WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN- TODAY'S HEARING WE HAVE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FIRST WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- LMAO AND- IN SE HA FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT SO. ISSUE NUMBER ONE- BASE FUNDING ENROLLMENT. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I CAN'T HEAR YOU SO LET'S START OVER. GAINES HOW GOOD MORNING BRIAN CAN HEAR YOU. I'M THE OPERATOR I HEAR YOU EITHER BRENT OKAY. SO MAYBE IT'S NOT SHOWING UP IN THE HEARING ROOM. YEAH WE HEAR SO GO AHEAD YEP. THANK YOU SO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR THE CHANCE TO REPRESENT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A 3% BASING CREASE FOR THE UNIVERSAL CALIFORNIA. THAT'S A HUNDRED AND THREE POINT NINE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. WHICH FOR UC CAMPUSES AND EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION FOR THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT YOU SEE PATH AND YOU SEE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS PART OF THE EARLY ACTION AGREEMENT RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A FINANCE LETTER WAS ISSUED TO PROVIDE YOU SEE THREE HUNDRED AND TWO POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. YOU SEE IS ENCOURAGED TO USE THESE RESOURCES FROM THE SPRING LETTER TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. CAMPUS IS- THEY'RE CHANGING OPERATIONAL PROBLEM PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS IN TOTAL COMBINING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE EARLY EARLY ACTION AGREEMENT. YOU SEE IT WOULD RECEIVE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND WHICH EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF UC'S BASED GENERAL FUND REDUCTION. FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. AND IT ALSO RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET 3% BATES AUGMENTATION COMES WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE UC WILL TO THE FOLLOWING. SUBMIT A REPORT BY JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO DETAILING PLANS FOR ACHIEVING GAPS AND THAT'S A LIMITING LIMITING EQUITY GAPS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. TO ADOPT POLICIES BY JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO REQUIRING CAMPUSES TO MAINTAIN 10% OF POINTS MORE ONLINE COURSES AND PROGRAMS THAN THEY HAD BEFORE COBIT BASED ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ACADEMIC YEAR. TO CREATE A NEW DUAL MISSIONS PROGRAM ENABLING FIRST TIME FRESHMEN TO RECEIVE GUARANTEED FUTURE ACCESS TO UC CAMPUS IF AND WHEN THEY COMPLETE AN EIGHTY T. OR ANOTHER ESTABLISH TRANSFER PATHWAY AND A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITHIN TWO ACADEMIC YEARS. TO BETTER ALIGN STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES WITH WORKFORCE AND INDUSTRY NEEDS. AND FINALLY THE LAST EXPECTATION IS TO HOLD RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND FEES FLAT FOR THE ACADEMIC YEAR. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. I THANK YOU WE ARE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU L. A. L. CHASING CONCENTRA SALLY- ISSUE ONE HAS THREE COMPONENTS TO IT ON THE FIRST IS THE LEVEL OF BASE SUPPORT THAT THE STATE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU SEE THE SECOND COMPONENT IS EXPECTATIONS TO ATTACH TO THE BASE SUPPORT AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE- IS ON A ROLL THAT MATTERS SO I'LL TALK ABOUT EACH COMPONENT. FIRST AS TO THE LEVEL OF BASE SUPPORT AS HAS BEEN NOTED THAT FEBRUARY AGREEMENT THAT WAS RECENTLY RELEASED- RESTORED REDUCTIONS THAT WERE MADE TO YOU SEE IN LAST YEAR'S PROJECT PROBLEMS THAT THIS RESTORATION FUNDING WOULD ALLOW YOU SEE TO COVER CERTAIN COSTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND FUND SOME RESTORATION ACTIVITIES LIKE THROWING UP PORTION OF VACANT POSITIONS. WERE ADDRESSING A UC'S ANY DEFICITS THAT WORKER DURING THE CURRENT YEAR H. THE QUESTION BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THEN IS WHETHER TO STOP IT THIS RECOVERY REMOTE OR TO GO FURTHER. FOR EXAMPLE- DOCKING THE WITH THE PER ADDITIONAL- 3% ON MEDICATIONS. I KNOW THERE ARE A FEW FACTORS TO CONSIDER- THERE ARE THE COST PRESSURES THAT ARE CITED ON PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA THAT YOU SEE IS FACING. THERE'S A STATE BUDGETS LIMITED CAPACITY FOR ONGOING SPENDING AND PROJECTED OUT YEAR DEFICITS. AND THEN AS NOTED THERE'S ALSO THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEDERALLY FUNDING I PROVIDED TO YOU SEE INCLUDING THAT THAT I'M NOT POTENTIALLY THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED UNDER THE UNDER THE NOOSE AROUND. I'M WITH ALL THESE FACTORS IN MIND WE RECOMMEND YOU REVISIT THE ISSUE OF BASE SUPPORT IN MAY REVISION. IN A REVISION- YOUR THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THE STATE. OF BUDGETS- OVERALL CONDITION. AND WILL ALSO HAVE SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THE NEW ROUND OF FEDERALLY FUNDING. ALSO THE SECOND COMPONENT ON THE OTHER BASED EXPECTATIONS IF YOU TURN THE PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA ALL THE BULLETS ON PAGE SEVEN LIST THE THREE CORE EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE PROPOSED FOR THE BUDGET BILL UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I'M GOING IN THE ORDER THAT YOU SEE THERE ON THAT FIRST EXPECTATION FOR- EQUITY. WE HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF CONCERN WITH THIS PROPOSAL- AS NOTED IN THE STAFF COMMENTS OF YOUR AGENDA ALL THE SEGMENTS ALREADY HAVE. PLANS IN PLACE TO ADDRESS EQUITY ISSUES OTHER CERTIFICATION OF LARGELY I RECOGNIZE THOSE EXISTING PLANS THE ONE EXCEPTION HERE IS THAT IN THE CASE OF YOU SEE THE EXPECTATION WOULD BE A FASTER TIMELINE THAN WHAT WHAT YOU SEE HAD ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. I JUST LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO SET THIS EXPECTATION WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON ALIGNING SOME OF THE STATE'S EXISTING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON STUDENT OUTCOMES. TO ENHANCE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE UNIVERSITY'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS SOME EQUITY PLAN. I'M NOT SECOND VOTE ON ONLINE EDUCATION- WE HAVE MORE CONCERNS WITH THIS EXPECTATION WE UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION'S DESIRE TO WANT TO SUSTAIN EFFORTS AROUND ONLINE EDUCATION LINE OF CODE- BUT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIFIC- PROPOSED TEN PERCENTAGE POINT TARGET. OTHER TARGET APPEARS ARBITRARY TO US LACKING IN JUSTIFICATION. IT ALSO RAISES POTENTIAL TRADE OFFS OF THE LEGISLATURE WANT MORE INFORMATION ON TRADE OFFS AND THINGS LIKE COSTS AND THE IMPACT ON STUDENT OUTCOMES. SO THIS CASE WE RECOMMENDED REJECTING THIS. PROPOSAL REPLACING IT INSTEAD WITH THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON EACH OF THE SEGMENTS EXPERIENCES WITH EDUCATION. THAT WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE MORE DATA SO THAT IT COULD MAKE MORE AND MORE FOR BUDGET DECISIONS AND FUTURE YEARS ON ON THE EDUCATION. I'M NOT I'M NOT BULLET TO ADMIT HERE WE HAVE THE MOST CAN. AND OUR CONCERNS AROUND- A LOT OF THE BASIC INFORMATION THAT'S MISSING ON THE NEW PATHWAY. ADMINISTRATION HASN'T CLARIFIED HOW MANY STUDENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE NEW PATHWAY WHICH KINDA STUDENTS SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO GAUGE THE POTENTIAL EQUITY PATENT PACKS OF THE NEW PATHWAY. AND IT HASN'T CLARIFIED HOW THE NEW PATHWAY WOULD INTERACT WITH THE OTHER EXISTING TRANSFER PATHWAYS LIKE THE EXISTING TRANSFORMATION GUARANTEES THAT SEVERAL UC CAMPUSES. THIS IS AN AREA WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO CLARIFY THESE BASIC ISSUES AND I THINK IN FAVOUR INFORMATION IS NOT FORTHCOMING BY ANY REVISION THE LEGISLATURE COULD REJECT THIS PROPOSAL REVISITED IN THE FUTURE YOUR ONE. MORE INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE. AND THEN ON THE FINAL COMPONENT ON A MOMENT THAT'S WHAT THIS IS THE SIMPLEST ISSUE OF ALL OF THIS ISSUE ONE BECAUSE THERE'S NO THERE'S NO PROPOSAL HERE. ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS LONGSTANDING PRACTICE OF NOT PROPOSING AN ENROLLMENT TARGET FOR YOU SEE. HEARD A STATE AND MANY PREVIOUS HEARINGS AND IN PREVIOUS YEARS. WE THINK THIS APPROACH IS POOR- CREATES CONFUSION AS TO THE LEGISLATURE'S EXPECTATIONS FOR ENROLLMENT FOR YOU SEE. AND HEAR WE RECOMMEND- SETTING A TARGET FOR YOU SEE AND WE RECOMMEND SETTING THAT TARGET. FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR SO FOR THE ACADEMIC YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. THAT WAS- ENSURE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO BETTER INFLUENCE FOLLOWING MISSION DECISIONS. I'M NOT A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER AND I'D BE HAPPY TO FURTHER EXPAND ENTITIES POINT START. OKAY THANK YOU. LET'S NOW GO TO THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA. GOOD MORNING CHAU MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE I'M SORRY EVER CANON AND I AM REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP ON THE GOVERNOR TO FULLY RESTORE UNIVERSITIES BASED BUDGET REDUCTIONS STARTING JULY FIRST. RECEIVING THESE FUNDS BACK IS CRITICAL TO AVOIDING STEEP REDUCTIONS WHAT SERVICES- THE RESTORATION OF THE UNIVERSITY SPACE BUDGET ALLOWS US TO MOVE AWAY FROM CRISIS MANAGEMENT WHICH COULD HAVE MEANT HUNDREDS OF LAYOFFS ACROSS THE SYSTEM THIS RESTORATION YES YOU SEE BACK TO THE SAME LEVEL FUNDING. AS IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR SCHOOL YEAR NOW WE CAN INSTEAD DISCUSS HOW THE UNIVERSITY'S OPERATIONS CAN BE SUPPORTED AND EVEN ENHANCED TO ALLOW OUR STUDENTS STAFF STAFF AND FACULTY DESCRIBING YOU START SKILLS TO PROVIDE. INNOVATION THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS. THE UNIVERSE OF HELP FIRST TO COVER NINETY AND BURKE OUR- ROLE OF RESEARCH. PUBLIC SERVICE INCLUDING THINGS LIKE TREATING PATIENTS PROVIDING COVERT TESTING THE COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING OUR CAMPUSES ARE PROVIDING REMOTE INSTRUCTION. EVEN THOUGH THE INITIAL MONTHS OF CODE NINETEEN WERE ECONOMICALLY STRAINING ON C. R. LEADERSHIP EXPRESSED A STRONG DESIRE TO ACCOMPLISH. LAUDABLE EMPLOYEES WHILE PRESERVING AND EVEN STRENGTHENING OUR EDUCATION AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. FROM THE START THE PANDEMIC TO JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THERE WERE NO CORPORATE RELATED LAYOFFS NUMBER CITY. AS OF THE END OF JANUARY UNIVERSE'S TOTAL CORPORATE RELATED COSTS AMOUNTED TO OVER THREE POINT ONE BILLION. OF THAT AMOUNT ONE POINT SIX BILLION WAS COST. TO CAMPUS OPERATIONS. HELP COVER THIS ONE SIX BILLION THE TWO RELIEF BILLS PASS SO FAR HAVE BEEN THE CAMPUS WITH NEARLY OR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION EMERGENCY EIGHT. THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE HAS HELPED GREATLY BUT THE UNIVERSITY CONTINUES TO FACE GREAT FINANCIAL PRESSURES MAKING THE BASE BUDGET RESTORATION CRITICAL IN AVOIDING TEACHER LAYOFFS. BUT ALSO VERY PERSONABLE GOVERNOR NEWSOM JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL WHICH PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN BC STUDENTS. WE WILL DISCUSS SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS IN GREATER DETAIL LATER IN THE HEARING BUT RIGHT NOW ALL FOCUSED ON THE BASE BUDGET GROWTH FUNDS. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION TO SUSTAIN FOR OPERATIONS IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY FIRST SCRIBNER. HE'S FUNDS ARE NEEDED TO PAY FOR COSTS THAT COME FROM BEING DRIVEN INSTITUTION AND INCLUDE ITEMS LIKE COMPENSATION INCREASES REPRESENTS LABOR ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT COSTS AND HEALTH CARE COST INCREASES. IF THE NEW FUNDING IS NOT RECEIVED UNIVERSITY WILL NEED TO FIND% OTHER WAYS TO COVER THESE COSTS SUCH AS CUTTING EXISTING SERVICES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES HUNDRED FOUR MILLION IN NEW FUNDING FOR OUR OPERATION INCREASES REQUESTING BURKE WHO OPENS FUNDS. THESE FUNDS ARE TIED THE TWO CHILDREN OF POLICY GOALS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN YOUR AGENDA AND WERE MENTIONED BY THE L. A. O. TO SOUTH. UNIVERSITY SHARES THE STATE'S GOALS OF ACCESS AND INCLUSION BUT WE DO HAVE TO REQUEST A REGARDING THESE. PROPOSALS ONE OF THE GUY OUTLINE GOALS TO READ REDUCE GRADUATION LIKE TWENTY FIVE. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SO ALREADY HAS BROAD. RATE OF 88% FRESHMAN AND FRIENDS SIX YEARS AND 89% OR TRANSFER AND TRANSFER FOR YEARS. STILL WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT UC REGENTS ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO. EQUITY AND INCLUSION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM AND WITH THESE GOALS IN MIND. THE FRAMEWORK TWENTY THIRTY PLAN. THIS PLAN SEEKS TO CLOSE GRADUATION. EQUITY GAPS- AT THE UNIVERSITY BY TWENTY THIRTY THE FIRST YER OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PLAN WAS ESTIMATED SIXTY MILLION. AND WE'RE ENTHUSIASTIC TO UNDERTAKE THE WORK OF CLOSING GRADUATION EQUITY CAPS BUT CANNOT DO SO WITHOUT RESOURCES. BECAUSE OUR OF OUR EFFORTS OF CLOSING GRADUATION GAPS HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY FUNDED- WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS BECAUSE A 20% INCREASE IN GRADUATION RATES NOW I'M TWENTY. FIVE AND REQUEST THAT FOR YOU SEE WE BOTH RECEIVE NEW FUNDING FOR THIS EFFORT AND THE TIMELINE JUST THE FACT LIKE THIRTY. ANOTHER POLICY GOAL PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IS TO INCREASE THE ONLINE COURSES BY UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY STUDYING DIFFERENT ROLES AND CHALLENGES OF REMOTE INSTRUCTION. INITIAL INDICATORS ARE THE REMOTE INSTRUCTION HAS NOT BEEN EQUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR ALL STUDENTS. WE'RE REQUESTING TIME TO COMPLETE OUR ANALYSIS BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SHIFTING TOWARDS ONLINE EDUCATION IT'S DESIRABLE. THE GOVERNOR'S LANGUAGES THAT WAS A 10% INCREASE FORGET ABOUT PROVIDING YOU FUNDING FOR COURSES WHICH WOULD MEAN NOT ADDING THE FULL NUMBER OF COURSES OFFERED BUT SHIFTING EXISTING COURSES ONLINE PEDAGOGY. THAT HAVING BEEN SAID WE DO SEE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASING ONLINE COURSE OFFERINGS AS A WAY TO SEARCH STUDENTS SUCH AS DURING SUMMER WHEN STUDENTS RETURN HOME WITH THEIR PARENTS OR TRAVEL. OR DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO INTERNSHIPS AND OTHER AT OTHER LOCATIONS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKING ACADEMIC PROGRESS. WELL WE SEE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE EXPANSION OF ONLINE EDUCATION WE REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE NOT ADOPT THE SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS I'M- AND FINALLY I WANT TO SHARE SOME GOOD NEWS. OF ALMOST UNIVERSITIES NATIONALISTS ARE DROP IN ENROLLMENT LAST FALL THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN BALTIMORE CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES. MEETING THE LEGISLATURE SKULL FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES OVER TWO YEARS. THESE NEWLY ENROLLED STUDENTS COMPOSE OUR LARGEST EVER CLASS OF UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS. ALSO OUR APPLICATIONS FOR FALL TWENTY ONE ADMISSIONS ARE THE HIGHEST EVER AND NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS RECEIVED. APPLICATIONS FROM AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS INCREASED BY ALMOST 22% OVER LAST YEAR AND APPLICATIONS FROM BLACK NEXT STUDENTS ROSE BY OVER TWELVE PERCENT. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE MISSION AMONG CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS. OF RESEARCH INCORPORATED WITH EDUCATION AND PUBLIC SERVICE. WE EDUCATE OVER TWO HUNDRED. EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND EMPLOYS NEARLY HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND FACULTY AND STAFF. WE CONTRIBUTE EIGHTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL ACTIVE HELP. ANNUALLY OUR FACULTY IT OVER FOR IN REECE FOR AND PRODUCED NEAR FORTY. DATE THE COUNTRY TO HELP NO ECONOMY AND THIS BOROUGH THE WORLD AND REYES LEADER. YES BENEFIT FROM THE CALL EDGE. IN OUTLOOK SUPPORTED BY BEING BY WERE CLASS. WE'RE THAT ENDED TO THE BUDGET PROVIDE UNIVERSITY AIDED BY MILLION AND ONGOING FUNDING CAMPUS OPERATE COSTA. AND EQUITY TO GROW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU I WE'LL HAVE QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS HERE. AND I WANT TO START OUT FOCUSING ON- ENROLLMENT AND- JUST MAYBE SAVE YOU CAN FIRST FOCUS ON. YOU KNOW W'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC AND UNIVERSITIES ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT NEXT YEAR GRANTED WE'RE IN MARCH AND YOU KNOW MOST UC'S DON'T START UNTIL LATE SEPTEMBER YES. BERKELEY STARTS A LITTLE EARLIER THIS SEMESTER SYSTEM SO WHAT'S THE TIME LINE FOR A UNIVERSITY TO ANNOUNCE THEIR PLANS FOR THE FALL FOR STUDENTS. WE WILL BE ANNOUNCING OUR PLANS BY APPROXIMATELY MID APRIL- WE ARE STARTING STUDENT ADMISSIONS NOW APPLICATIONS ARE BEING CONSIDERED AT THE MOMENT- OUR CURRENT PLAN IS TWO FOLD- IN ROMAN FLAT. FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ARE ALSO NOT PLANNING ON A TUITION INCREASE YEAH I'M SORRY I'M NOT SURE HE ENTERED THE QUESTION. I MEAN IN PERSON VERSUS VIRTUAL WELL I'LL GET TO AND ROLLED IN THE SECOND SO WHAT. ARE YOUR PLANS AS FAR AS ANNOUNCING. WHAT TYPE OF TAX. UC'S WILL HAPPEN. AT THAT NINE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES. AT THE MOMENT SIR WE ARE HOPING TO HAVE A HYBRID INSTRUCTION PRIMARILY IN PERSON WITH- SOME OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE- BEING. INVOLVED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- WITH THE HELP SOME SECTIONS HAPPENING ONLINE WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN. IMPLEMENT THAT WILL DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF VACCINATIONS THAT ARE PROVIDED WITHIN THE STATE AND- GETTING TO HERD IMMUNITY WHERE OUR FACULTY STAFF AND STUDENTS CAN SAVE ATTENDED PERSON INSTRUCTION- IT APPEARS THAT FROM SOME OF THE STATEMENTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THERE MAY BE ENOUGH VACCINE BY THE END OF MAY. TO ACHIEVE THAT SO AT THAT TIME WE WOULD BE ABLE TO STATE- FROM WHAT THE INSTRUCTION WILL BE FOR NEXT FALL. SO AGAIN THAT THE GOAL FOR HYBRID INSTRUCTION THE DECISION THAT THAT'S THE GOAL AND THE DECISION WILL BE MADE. IN MAY OR LATER IN THE SUMMER. A WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION BY THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER ALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE- IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PLAN AND IN ORDER TO HAPPEN FORCES EITHER- ON MIGRATED BACK TO REMOTE INSTRUCTION OR- PROVIDE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION SO WE ANTICIPATE KNOWING BY THE END OF HEY WE CAN HAVE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION ALL. OKAY THANK YOU I WENT OF ON A PIVOT NOW TO THE ENROLLMENT AND ACCESS TO. TO THE UC SYSTEM FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA. I MAY SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD THIS IS MY SEVENTH YEAR BUT I VENTURE TO SAY THIS IS THAT THE TOP ISSUE THAT WE GET WE GO BACK HOME TALKING ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION. WE INEVITABLY RUN INTO PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES SOCCER FIELDS ARE GROCERY STORES TALKING ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBOR THEIR CHILD THEIR GRANDSON OR NEPHEW SOMEONE THEY KNOW WHO HAS. STELLAR HIGH SCHOOL. GRADES AND TEST. NO LONGER NEED THE DEATH TEST SCORES BUT BUT A STELLAR GRADES THEIR- APPLYING TO THE UC AND THEY CAN IN IN SO BEEN A PRIOR FOR. ALL NUMBER AND BUDGET TAKING A I WORKED REALLY TO. COME UP WITH THAT I CAP ON NON RESIDENT ROLE MEANT NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENTS WHICH- WE SUPPORT THERE ARE SOME EFFORTS TO PUSH THAT DOWN WHICH I KNOW MR TANG'S WANTS TO TALK ABOUT A BIT. BUT WE HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED CALIFORNIA RESIDENT ROMAN AS YOU SEE ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE AGENDA IN A LARGE PART IT'S BECAUSE- WE PUSHED A TARGET TO THAT WE WANTED THAT- A NUMERIC TARGET TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD SOMETHING THAT WE COULD. FALL BACK ON FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS SHOWING THAT WE'RE INCREASING ACCESO A UC HAS HISTORICALLY NOT WANTED THAT THEY WANT TO. A LINE ITEM OVERALL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET AND- YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE PUSHED BACK HAVING IT AT TARGET AND SO I KNOW THAT JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO YOU SEE REPORTED. THAT WE HAD A RECORD NUMBER OF APPLICANTS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH IS GREAT THAT SHOWS THAT MORE AND MORE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING. COLLEGE READY A THREE G. READY- WE HAVE A BIG INCREASE IN LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN APPLICANTS AS WE KNOW. ESPECIALLY WITH LATINO APPLICANTS WE KNOW THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION NUMBERS ARE JUST CHANGED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS AND SO MORE AT MORE STUDENTS. IT'S HAPPENING ON THE NATURAL ANYWAY BUT NONETHELESS. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY PLEASED ABOUT THAT WHAT WHAT CAN WE- DO. TO GUARANTEE MORE ADDRESS. WHAT WE HAVE- INCLUDE RESTORED THE MONEY FROM LAST YEAR WE HAD THE BASE INCREASE FOR JANUARY YOU'RE ASKING FOR MORE MORE FEDERAL MONEY COMING IN THAT'S THAT'S ONE TIME PER SE NON OWNER BUT WE WANT TO LOCK IN. INCREASE IN DEMAND- YOU SEE ENROLLMENT ABOVE THE CURRENT YEAR FOR NEXT YEAR SO WHAT CAN YOU SEE. IN OUTLINED TODAY THE COMMITMENTS ARE MORE. ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA FRESHMEN STUDENTS NOT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION START- FOR YOU TO CHOOSE TO PROVIDE ENROLLMENT FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY WE REQUEST THAT WE RECEIVE THE FULL MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION FOR EACH NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE US TO ENROLL IN ORDER FOR US TO ENROLL MORE STUDENTS WE ARE YOU NEED THAT BASS RESTORATION AND WE DO NEED OUR CAMPUS COST INCREASES COVERED IN ADDITION TO THAT. NEW ENROLLMENT FUNDING IF YOU WOULD CHOOSE TO PROVIDE IT TO US- ALSO HE- CLOSING EQUITY GAPS LANGUAGE ARE- FUNDING THAT WE'RE REQUESTING THE THIRTY POINT FOUR MILLION FOR THAT. WOULD ALLOW US TO START MOVING SOME STUDENTS THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM FASTER WE HAVE A CURRENTLY MOST OF OUR STUDENTS ARE TAKING FOR YEARS AND ONE TERM. TO GRADUATE AND IF WE GOT THEM TO GRADUATE A LITTLE BIT FASTER WE WOULD- BE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR EACH INCOMING OR COURT. APPLIED THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE GET TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS YEAH. I DON'T THINK THAT'S QUITE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT I THINK THAT WE WERE GIVING THE BASE INCREASE OF 3% WE'RE INCREASING THAT THAT. WE'RE RESTORING THE CUTS FROM LAST YEAR. AND YOU KNOW WE THINK WITHIN THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A LINE ITEM. FOR IN ROME AND THAT'S WHAT WE WILL BE HAPPY. GLOBAL COMPETITION ARE BY IN A THINK HE KNOW THAT'S THE THAT'S GOAL OF THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT. YOU KNOW THE TRUST BUT VERIFY I THINK THAT- WHEN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON OUR TOP PRIORITY- AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S ADEQUATE RESPONSE BUT THIS IS. THAT'S YOUR POSITION AS YOU SEE AS WE GO TO GO THROUGH THIS DANCE EVERY YEAR SO WE WILL. SPEND OUR FINAL BUDGET WILL FOCUS ON IT AROMA TARGET TO MAKE SURE WE- INCREASE ACCESS- FOR CALIFORNIANS. I WILL FIGHT I ALSO FOUGHT I KNOW THERE THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE ALL DAHLE STOP HERE. I MAY COME BACK I KNOW THAT I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT- IT'S NOT. QUITE A CHEN DICE HERE BUT AS FAR AS ENROLLMENT AND ACCESS FOR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT TERM IT DENIED OTHERS THE WORKING ON. IS ADMISSIONS AND ADMISSIONS- REFORMS THAT YOU SEE HAVE BEEN TAKING TAKEN SENSE- THE ADMISSIONS- YOU KNOW- SCANDAL A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WITH WE SAW WITH YOU KNOW WEALTHY DONORS AND SLAVERY AND SO FORTH GAME IN THE UC SYSTEM SO WE HAD. SOME REFORMS TWO YEARS AGO THE STATE AUDITOR CAME OUT WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS I KNOW MR GALLAGHER WHEN ASKED IF WE COULD SPOKE ASKED IF HE COULD. ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES TODAY SO IT'S NOT A GEN DIS SAY HOW BUT I IF YOU COULD PLEASE HELP US AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES SO- WITH THAT- MISTER MEDINA. THANK YOU ARE. YOU MENTIONED- UP. IN A OF. TO YOU. AND WE MADE REFERENCE TO THE DIVERSITY. AND OTHER THAN THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT I. LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE EXCITED ABOUT. BUT- LAST WEEK THERE WAS A- OP ED PIECE IN THE LA TIMES THE TALKED ABOUT YOU SEE. THE HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS. WONDER IF YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT OP ED PIECE. IN THE L. A. TIMES. DO SO SEE YA I BLOCK THEM UC MERCED. THANK YOU MR MEDINA- I BELIEVE THE ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH YOU I'M NOT A FUNDING FOR CAMPUS STUDENTS AND HOW HE FUNDING WAS ALLOCATED BETWEEN CAMPUSES- WHEN THE STATE PROVIDES APPROPRIATIONS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- THE WAY WE DIVIDE THE FUNDING WHEN YOU APPROPRIATE FUNDS TO US. WE PROVIDED TO OUR CAMPUSES FOR A PROCESS CALLED RETENTION OF FIRST FROM THOSE FUNDS YOU PROVIDE TO US WE TAKE CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT SERVE ALL STUDENTS- THOSE ARE FUNDED OFF THE TOP THAT INCLUDES PROGRAMS LIKE THEY PROP- AND CERTAIN OF SYSTEM WHY PROGRAMS LIKE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATIONS- THEN WE ALSO REMOVE FINANCIAL AID- BECAUSE THAT GETS DIVIDED. BETWEEN CAMPUSES BASED ON STUDENT NEED- AND THEN THE REMAINDER OF THOSE FUNDS ARE PROVIDED CAMPUSES BASED ON A FORMULA WHERE EACH UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT RECEIVES THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING THIS WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE EQUALITY BETWEEN THE CAMPUSES. NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN USING THE SYSTEM FOR- MULTIPLE. HERE SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WE REALIZE THAT THERE MAY SOME ISSUES WITH HOW THE FUNDS ARE TO. AND THE REGIONS ARE EXAMINING THE FORMULA- WE ARE THINKING ABOUT CHANGING IT TO WHERE NO CAMPUS WHERE YOU'RE RECEIVING- LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT. OF IN THE UNWEIGHTED STUDENT AMOUNT- FROM OTHER CAMPUSES. AND THAT IS IT MUST BE BETTER THAN WHAT AT THE 95% SO YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUE. THE TWO AUTHORS- I BELIEVE PROFESSORS AT UC MERCED SOCIOLOGY IS ALSO. PUBLISHED A RECENT BOOK CALLED BROKEN. THAT EXAMINES THE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY AT UC RIVERSIDE AND UC MERCED SO A QUESTION AND THEY THEY THEY COME TO SOME VERY- I THINK STARTLING PROVOCATIVE CONCLUSIONS SO IF WE WERE TO SUBTRACT THE NUMBER OF. OF LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. IN UC FROM- UC RIVERSIDE UC MERCED UC SANTA BARBARA. AND UC SANTA CRUZ- WE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE A MUCH LESS DIVERSE UC- THEN WE HAVE AT PRESENT SO THE AUTHORS MAKE THE POINT THAT YOU SEE IS ABLE TO- YOU KNOW- EXPOUND ON ON THE DIVERSITY OF THE UC- ENROLLMENT. BUT THE AUTHORS POINT OUT THAT THAT A LOT OF IT IS CONCENTRATED AT UC RIVERSIDE AND UC MERCED. WHICH HAPPENED TO BE THE MOST UNDERFUNDED- CAMPUSES OF THE UC SYSTEM- WE TALK ABOUT OUT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND I UNDERSTAND AS ALL OF US DO HERE. HOW YOU SEE HAS A RELIED ON THAT AS ESPECIALLY DURING. THE TIME OF LESS FUNDING FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT AS WE LOOK TO SEE HOW WE CAN BETTER- B. MORE EQUAL IN THE TREATMENT OF ALL THE CAMPUSES. I DON'T MIGHT PROPOSE THE IDEA THAT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BEFORE THAT THE INCOME THE REVENUE THAT IS PRODUCED BY INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS- AND- OUT OF STATE STUDENTS BE DIVIDED. AMONG ALL THE CAMPUSES BECAUSE CERTAINLY NOT ALL THE CAMPUSES HAVE THE SAME- RESOURCES TO ATTRACT. HOW TO STATE AND INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS- SO I DO THINK THAT- THE CONCLUSIONS THAT THE AUTHORS COME OUT WITH IN THEIR BOOK I IN THEIR OP ED PIECE IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE NEEDS TO LOOK AT MORE MORE CAREFULLY. BECAUSE OF THE OTHER POINT IS THAT- THE FORMULAS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG. WORKED TO THE DETRIMENT OF THOSE MOST DIVERSE CAMPUSES AND WORK FOR THE DETRIMENT TO THE AREAS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT UNFORTUNATELY ARE MORE IN THE HAVE NOTS THAN THE HOUSE SO SOMETHING TO LOOK. AT MORE CLOSELY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER. IT WHAT DO YOU WANT TO PAY FOR THE RESPONSE FROM THAT- JUST ESTá OUT IF- IF WE COULD MAYBE HAVE A RESPONSE TO. THE IDEA OF SHARING REVENUE. OF FOR INTERNATIONAL AN OUT OF STATE STUDENTS YEAH. CURRENTLY INTERNATIONAL AN OUT OF STATE STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THE FULL COST OF THEIR OWN EDUCATION WHICH MEANS A LOT OF THEIR FEES GO TO THE CAMPUS WHERE THEY ARE SO THAT THE FULL COST OF THEIR EDUCATION CAN BE COVERED. EACH INTERNATIONAL STUDENT DOES HOWEVER- HEY MORE THAN WHAT IT COSTS TO EDUCATE THEM SO THERE IS FUNDING LEFT OVER FROM THE CAMPUS OF WHERE THEY ARE CURRENTLY STUDYING. THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING USED BY THOSE CAMPUSES TO PAY FOR THEIR FACULTY AND OTHER STUDENTS SERVICES OR OPERATIONS ON BOTH CAMPUSES SO IF THERE WAS ANY MOVEMENT OFFUNDING AWAY WE HAVE TO BE VERY COGNISANT. OF SUDDEN DRASTIC REDUCTIONS TO OUR CAMPUS BUDGET. THIS IS AN IDEA THAT- I THINK WE SHOULD TALK MUCH MORE. ABOUT- ONE ONE. OF COURSE WOULD BE- IF JUST THE TOTAL NUMBER OF NON RESIDENTS WITH INCREASED SYSTEM WIDE. OR REVENUE DISTRIBUTION BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE A FAVOR OF THAT IDEA BUT WE CAN HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION THANK YOU SIR. I YEAH I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHAT WHAT MR MEDINA SAID ABOUT THE DIVERSE CITY NUMBERS WITH THE TWO THINGS ONE. THE LATINO HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST TEN TWENTY YEARS THE NUMBER OF LATINO GRADUATES WHO. ARE A THREE G. READY AND YOU SEE ELIGIBLE SO YOU SEE OBVIOUSLY IS TAKE NOTE OF THAT AND PATTING OURSELVES ON THE BACK FOR THAT. OKAY BUT I THINK MR MEDINA'S POINT IS WELL TAKEN IF YOU LOOK AT. THE THAT NINE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES YOU KNOW IF YOU REALLY THAT THAT THREE OF THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER WITH UCLA. BERKELEY AND- SAN DIEGO. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THE DIVERSEY NUMBERS FOR THOSE. THOSE ARE STILL VERY DISCOURAGING FOR US AS AS AS GOOD AS DATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AFTER SO KEEP THAT IN MIND- MR GALLAGHER. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- SO. YOU'RE RUNNING SOME OF THE NUMBERS. YOU SEE ENROLLMENT GREW BY SEVEN POINT TWENTY NINETEEN. HOWEVER WITHIN THIS GROWTH NONRESIDENT ROAMING GREW BY 17% WELL RESIDENT ENROLLMENT GREW BY FIVE POINT RESULT OF THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT DECLINED. FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY BY THREE POINT GREW SLIGHTLY BY ABOUT 1% SO MY QUESTION TO YOU SEE IS DOES THIS PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY NOW. FOR YOU SEE TO RE BALANCE THE RATIOS OF NON RESIDENT AND RESIDENT ENROLLMENT ESPECIALLY AT CAMPUSES LIKE BERKELEY AND UCLA WITH THE HISTORY OF MORE THAN 18% NONRESIDENT. ENROLLMENT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SIR- WE DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO REBALANCE OUR NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT BECAUSE THE STUDENTS DO YOU ONLY A LOT OF MONEY TO ALL THE CAMPUSES WHERE THEY ATTEND- AND IF WE REMOVE THOSE FUNDS FROM THE CAMPUS BUDGETS. THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE CUTS TO EXISTING SERVICES. THANK YOU. OKAY WELL I MEAN I THINK LIKE YOU'VE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S AN ACCEPTABLE ANSWER- YOU KNOW FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED BEFORE BUT MOST ESPECIALLY YOU ARE A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SYSTEM AND WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY WANTED OUT OF YOU THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE WANT IS TO SEE THAT THOSE RATIOS. NINE GET TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE WHICH IS THE SHOULD BE- SYSTEM THAT SERVES. FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS SO I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE GOING FROM THERE BUT I THINK FOR US. WE'RE HEARING VERY CLEARLY FROM YOU SEE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS- SO I THINK THAT SHOULD GO INTO OUR PLANNING AS- HOW WE WANT TO HELP. HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS- ON THE ISSUE OF. ANOTHER VERY FRUSTRATING THING FOR ME I WENT TO UC BERKELEY I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO GO THERE BUT YOU KNOW I WORKED REALLY HARD. YEAH YOU KNOW IN HIGH SCHOOL AND- NO DID THE WORK OUT A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM MY COMMUNITY AND WAS FORTUNATE TO GET IN THERE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I NEVER HAD ANYBODY WRITING A LETTER FROM ME. THERE WAS NO TRUSTEE. WRITING A LETTER FOR ME TO GET ME INTO- UC BERKELEY- SO IT'S VERY. FRUSTRATING TO HEAR OF EVEN AFTER THE SCANDAL. YOU KNOW FOR THIS AUDIT TO COME OUT. AND SHOW THAT LOOK THESE PRACTICES ARE STILL HAPPENING AT UC. CAMPUSES THOSE WHO HAVE. FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES ARE GETTING IN. AND STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF AND MANY STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THIS- YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MANY STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD AND HAVE AND HAVE GOTTEN THE GRADES AND I'VE GOTTEN THE SCORES- THEY DIDN'T GET THAT PLACE. IN IN THE AUDIT SHOWS A VERY CLEARLY THERE'S PEOPLE THAT DID NOT GET THAT PLACE IN THAT SEAT. AND INSTEAD SOMEONE WHO HAD CONNECTIONS- EVEN CASES OF YEP TRUSTEES UC REGENTS WHO WROTE LETTERS ARE NO BIG DEAL I WROTE IT FOR MY COUSINS KIDS. IT'S NO BIG DEAL. YEAH I DO THAT ALL THE TIME. HE GETS IN. THAT'S A PROBLEM AND SO WHAT I DO WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU SEE IS. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE. TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOESN'T EVER HAPPEN AGAIN THAT YOU WHAT WHAT CHANGES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN MADE. YOU KNOW SO THAT. REGION'S MAJOR DONORS. POLITICALLY CONNECTED PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO INFLUENCE THAT ADMISSIONS PROCESS IN THE WAY THAT WE KNOW IS DOCUMENTED DID HAPPEN. AT YOU SEE WHAT CHANGES HAVE WE IMPLEMENTED AND WHAT CHANGES ARE WE GOING TO WHAT OTHER CHANGES ARE WE GOING TO IMPLEMENT IT YOU SEE. TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL EDUCATION. THANK YOU SIR AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING BURKE FAMILY SCHOOL STUDENTS WORK VERY VERY HARD TO GET INTO UC TO HEAR ABOUT INSTANCES LIKE. SOME OF THE CHANGES THE PROCESS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IS THAT- OTHER OFFICES WITH IN THE CAMPUS LIKE THE DEVELOPMENT OFFICE- THAT'S THE FUNDRAISING ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO HAVE CONTACT WITH EMISSIONS OFFICE REGARDING. APPLICATIONS WE'RE ALSO IMPLEMENTING- A MULTI STARRER READING YOU ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE- GETTING IN THROUGH THE ADMISSIONS BY EXCEPTION PROCESS THAT IS THE STUDENTS WHO OF FOR SOME REASON DON'T HAVE- HIGH SCHOOL GRADES OR- HAVE SOME OTHER ISSUE. THROUGH WHICH THEY ARE GETTING INTO THE UNIVERSITY- SO THOSE WERE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AUDITOR THERE ARE EMPLOYMENT AND- WE DO HAVE A TEAM OF INTERNAL AUDITORS WHO ARE LOOKING AT THE- CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO SEE HOW THEY CAN IMPLEMENT THAT. WITHIN THE UC SYSTEM AND TO MAKE. THE PROCESS BETTER FOR ALL STUDENTS. IBM IN OF THOSE. AT THIS POINT IN TIME. I DON'T HAVE THE LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN FRONT OF ME TO SAY HOW MANY OF THEM WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED IT BUT I BELIEVE THAT TWO OF THOSE HAVING THE MULTI STEP PROCESS OF REVIEW OR ADMISSIONS BY EXCEPTION AND- I'M NOT ALLOWING ANY CONTACT WITH THE DEVELOPING OFFICE. WERE AUDITORS RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN- COULD YOU I WOULD LIKE IF YOU GUYS COULD REPORT BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE YOU KNOW THROUGH A LETTER- NO STADIUM WHICH RECOMMENDATIONS YOU GUYS HAVE AGREED TO IMPLEMENT. WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO DO THAT. YES SIR WE CAN DO THAT FOR YOU- WILL WILL REGION'S BE ABLE TO WRITE LETTERS OF SUPPORT FOR ADMISSION EXACTLY IS THAT PROCESS GOING TO CONTINUE. I BELIEVE THAT PROCESS- WILL NOT BE CONTINUING AS WELL. THAT WILL BE ENDED. OKAY WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH THAT'S. IT WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT WILL OR WILL. I'M SORRY SIR I DON'T HAVE THE LIST OF ACTIONS IN FRONT OF ME TO SAY WITH COMPLETE CERTAINTY BUT WE WILL GET YOU A LETTER THAT OUTLINES WHICH ACTIONS UNIVERSITY HAS TAKEN. AND WHICH WE ARE STILL EXAMINING. OKAY WILL BE GOOD JUST TO GET A DEFINITIVE LIST AND SOMETHING THAT'S CLEAR WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT'S THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING FOR. THANK YOU I'M I'LL JUST WANNA NOTE MR GALLAGHER THAT THIS WAS A VERY. DISTURBING- US DAYS WERE VERY DISTURBING STORIES BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE THAT CAME OUT A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD A PACKAGE OF BILLS AND IT WAS OPERATION VARSITY BLUES OF COURSE AND- FEDERAL INDICTMENTS AND- PEOPLE WENT TO PRISON INCLUDING NOTABLE CELEBRITIES WHICH MADE THE NEWS BUT- IT JUST. YOU KNOW IT SHOOK THE CONFIDENCE OF THE UC. ADMISSIONS AND IT'S GOOD CUT THAT COUPLES WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY. AND EVEN IF IT WAS HALF A DOZEN OR DOZEN OR WHATEVER THIS THAT'S A SLOT THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S QUALIFIED SO. WE DID IT DOT SOME REFORMS- I ADDED I HAD A BILL IN THERE MR TEEING IT- QUICK SILVA AND- TASHA BOERNER HORVATH HAD AN AUDIT THAT- THE WORK STILL CONTINUES OUR THREE BILL'S GOING TO THE HIRING COMMITTEE THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS GONNA BE EVALUATING THIS YEAR. BUT IN THAT OUR FINAL BUDGET ACTION I THINK WE WILL DO SOME OVERSIGHT ON THIS AND REQUEST SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST BROUGHT UP MR GALLAGHER. IS TO HAVE YOU SEE MAKE SURE THEY CAN REPORT. AND THESE THINGS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE WHAT WHAT THE AUDITOR FOUND OUT. IS THAT EVEN WITH THE REFORMS THAT WE ADOPTED THERE ARE STILL SOME PIECES THAT WERE. SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACK AND DOCTOR CHOI HAS A BILL TO WORK ON ONE OF THOSE ISSUES AS WELL SO. IT'S AN ONGOING. ISSUE THAT THAT WE THINK IS OF CONCERN WE'RE GONNA KEEP KEEP AT IT AND- LIKE I SAID EARLIER YOU KNOW. TRUST BUT VERIFY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEE IS STEPPING UP AND DOING RIGHT. BY THIS- I WITH THAT- MISTER O'DONNELL. THANK YOU KNOW STATURE JUST JUMPING ON YOUR COMMENTS TO MR GALLAGHER'S COMMENTS. DID YOU KNOW OF ANY UC REGENTS WROTE LETTERS THIS YEAR. IN SUPPORT OF ANY POTENTIAL. ENROLLEES IN THE UC SAN. I DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION SIR I DON'T. THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE BANNED I MEAN THAT THAT'S A NO BRAINER TO ME ESPECIALLY AS WE PULL AWAY FROM THE SAT AND THE ACT. IT BECOMES MORE OF A QUALITATIVE EXERCISETHAT A QUANTITATIVE EXERCISE QUITE FRANKLY IN ENROLLING STUDENTS. AND IT SHOULDN'T BE. WHO YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD BE WHAT YOU CAN DO. SO THAT THAT THAT'S OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME AND AS WE- GET RID OF SOME OF THESE STANDARDIZED TESTS THIS IS A NATURAL THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN- SO WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO IT TOO. TO MONITOR THIS BECAUSE I AM VERY CONCERNED AS WE GET AGAIN READ THESE TESTS. SO HOW DO YOU GET ADMITTED. IS IT JUST GPA OR IS IT HEY A GPA PLUS WHO YOU KNOW THESE LETTERS YET WHAT IS A RECOMMENDATION WILL. A LOT OF TIMES IT MATTERS WHO THE LETTER RECOMMENDATIONS FROM QUITE FRANKLY- AND NOT EVERY STUDENT POTENTIAL STUDENT. HAS ACCESS TO CERTAIN YOU KNOW. NO LEVELS OF POWER IN THE STATE QUITE FRANKLY AND- THAT'S THAT'S OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME AND THAT'S SOMETHING- I THINK WE SHOULD MONITOR AS AS AS A LEGISLATURE I'VE HEARD A LOT OF FOLKS AROUND HER SUPPORT GETTING RID OF SOME THESE STANDARDIZED TESTS. ARE THEY GIVE ME A BIT OF CONCERN. BECAUSE THAT WHAT NEXT WHAT THEN DO WE GO TO IS IT ONLY TO STUDENTS AT ADDED ACCESS TO OUR HONORS CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL AP CLASSES. WHERE THOSE WHO DIDN'T DON'T GET THAT HIGHER GPA. DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HIGH THAT TO HAVE THAT HIGHER GPA OR- INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE STUDENTS EAGER HIGH SCHOOL DOESN'T HAVE. AN IB PROGRAM. MIGHT YOU NOT THEN BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE UC SO THERE'S A LOT BILL TEND. TO THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS THE ADMITTANCE PROCESS. HOLDING TO RECOGNIZE THAT JUST FOLLOWING TWO GPA AND RECOMMENDATIONS MAY NOT BE THE BEST PRACTICE SO I HOPE I HOPE THE UC IS THINKING ABOUT I HAVE A KIND OF A SIMPLE QUESTION IS PROBABLY SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE ASKED SEVEN YEARS AGO BUT IT MORE IS ABOUT YOUR BUDGET PRACTICE AND IT'S OUTSIDE REALLY THE STUDENTS ARENA I'D CALL YOUR ENTERPRISE ARENA LIKE YOUR HOSPITALS. SO JUST A QUESTION WITH REGARD TO LET'S SAY YOUR HOSPITALS THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT I WOULD LABEL ENTERPRISE FUNCTION RIGHT SEPARATE. MOSTLY FROM THE UNIVERSITY. SO WHAT LIKE. WHEN THERE'S A HOSPITAL I'M SEEING SOME THINGS ON HERE. RETIREMENT HELP BENEFIT INCREASE INCREASES CAPITAL OUTLAY. I WOULD ASSUME THAT A HOSPITAL ON THE UC PIECE OF PROPERTY LEASES THAT PROPERTY FROM THE UC I WOULD ASSUME THAT THEY- OUR TAKE AND FUNNY THEIR PORTION. OF THE BENEFIT INCREASES OF EITHER CURRENT EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES THAT ARE RETIRED IS THE GENERAL FUND THE STATE GENERAL FUND IS NOT SUPPORTING THAT. THE THOSE INCREASES BUT THOSE THOSE THOSE MONIES COME FROM WITHIN THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM OR THE ENTERPRISE. EFFORT IN OF ITSELF WOULD THAT BE ACCURATE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SIR. YES THAT'S ACCURATE THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM AND THE OTHER ANCILLARIES LIKE THE DORMITORIES AND PARKING. HEY THERE US SHARE OF THE COST INCREASES WHAT WE COME HERE AND REQUEST FROM THE LEGISLATURE IS JUST FOR FUNDS ON THE CAMPUSES THE- TUITION AND THE STATE GENERAL FUND. COMPONENT. OF THOSE COST INCREASES. SO I I'M NOT SURE I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND YOUR COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD YOUR YOUR ANSWER THERE SO THERE IS A WALL SO IF THERE IS- COST INCREASES THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT RETIRED FROM THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE IT WOULD BE WAITED AND THAT THEY WOULD BE THAT THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM WOULD BE BURDENED WITH THOSE OUT YOUR INCREASES AS WELL. EIGHT WHAT ONE STATE EMPLOYEE RETIRES THEY'RE GETTING BENEFITS FROM THE RETIREMENT PROGRAM AND THEY'RE GETTING FEET UP FROM THE INTEREST THAT THAT. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS IN THERE. IS ACCUMULATING AND THE MONEY'S COMING OUT OF THAT HOLE. BEFORE THEY RETIRE THERE ARE PAYMENTS TOWARD THEIR RETIREMENT ARE BEING PAID BY THE HOSPITAL ENTIRELY SO THE CENTRAL IF IT'S A HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE THE CENTRAL CAMPUS IS NOT PAYING TO WORK THERE THAT INDIVIDUALS RETIREMENT OR THEIR HEALTHCARE OR ANY OTHER EMPLOYEE COST EXPENDITURES THOSE WOULD BE COVERED ENTIRELY BY THE HOSPITAL SO YES THERE IS A FIREWALL BETWEEN THOSE EXPENSES HE EVEN IN THE OUTER SO THEY'RE RETIRED NOW. RIGHT THEN ALL SUDDEN WELL WE FIND OUT THAT THE PENSION SYSTEM IS STRESSED AND IT NEEDS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT THE HOSPITAL BE BURDEN FOR THEIR PORTION. OF THAT STRESS IF YOU WILL. IS THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM HAS TO PAY FOR THE EXPENSES RELATED TO ANY OPERATION OF THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES THEIR CAPITAL OUTLAY DEBT SERVICE YOU KNOW ALL THE BONDS- ANY LEASE REVENUES SO FOUR. BUT THE WAY THE RETIREMENT PROGRAM WORKS IN UNIVERSITY PUTS- PAYMENTS INTO THE TOTAL PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF ALL OUR EMPLOYEES AND WHEN THAT EMPLOYEE RETIRES THEY CLAIM THOSE FUNDS BACK FROM THE RETIREMENT PROGRAM. WELL THEY THEY WOULD FILE FOR THEIR PENSION RIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CORRECT. AND IN THE OUT IN THE OUT YEARS. WE FIND THAT. MAYBE THAT WAS THAT WAS UNDER FUNDED. AND GENERAL FUND DOLLARS ARE USED TO SUPPORT THAT SHOULDN'T TO THE HOSPITAL. OR THE ENTERPRISE EFFORT FUND THAT. FROM THE BENCH I'M USING A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE YES AND I BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ENTERPRISE FUNDS ARE SUPPORTING EITHER THE- BUT NOW IN THE LAB. WITH REGARD TO THE OUT YOUR COSTUME. I'M NOT SURE YOUR ANSWER MY QUESTION MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE A QUESTION AND ANSWER TODAY. IF YOU CAN RESEARCH THAT AND GET BACK TO ME AND I'M VERY MUCH APPRECIATIVE AGAIN MIKE MY QUESTION. ARE THE ENTERPRISE FUNDS- PARTICIPATING IN. IN IN SOME OF THE- THE LONG TERM EXPENSES NOT JUST TODAY NOT JUST WRITING A CHECK TODAY HEY WE'RE DONE. BUT THERE MIGHT BE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH WITH WITH THEIR OPERATIONS IN THE OUT YEARS THAT THEN ARE BURDENED ON TO THE GENERAL FUND. IT IS CORRECT THAT OUR RETIREMENT PROGRAM IS NOT- AT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. FUNDING CURRENTLY YOU SEE R. P- DOES DOES HAVE- SOME UNFUNDED LIABILITY CURRENTLY I WOULD NEED TO HAVE- AN EXPERT COME AND SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THAT WE DO HAVE AN ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS. THANK REPORTED ANNUALLY THANK YOU YOUR I THINK WE GOT TIED UP ON THE PENSION FUND IT'S NOT JUST THE PENSION FUND IN ASKING ABOUT- SO BUT I THINK I ASK THE QUESTION AND PROBABLY IN A REQUIRE FURTHER RESEARCH SO WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION OFFLINE DOWN THE ROAD. WHEN MAYBE WE CAN GATHER SOME MORE INFORMATION ON M. AND AGAIN MY CONCERN IS THAT THE GENERAL FUND THE BURDEN. WITH ENTERPRISE FUND- COSTS. AYE THERE'S MOSTLY LONG TERM BUT WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AT A DIFFERENT DAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER VITAS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. SO THE PROPOSED BUDGET LANGUAGE DOESN'T IDENTIFY SPECIFIC EQUITY GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED BUT IT REQUIRES A YOU SEE THE REPORT. TWO A DETAILED ACTIONABLE SPECIFIC PLANS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF FULLY CLOSING EQUITY GAPS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO WHAT EQUITY GOALS IS THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTING THE PLANS TO REFLECT IN A CHEAP BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND SINCE ARE NOT SPECIFIED HOW IS YOU SEE INTERPRETING- WHAT EQUITY GOALS- ARE. THE FIRST QUESTION IS A DEMONSTRATION. BRIAN RUTLEDGE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO I CAN ADDRESS THE WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE CAN RESPOND AT ARE THEY MIGHT INTERPRET IT BUT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING AN AMBITIOUS BUT ACHIEVABLE- INCREASE IN IN ADDRESSING EQUITY GAPS. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE VIEW THIS AS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES WERE PROPOSING HERE. THE REAL. THE REAL ISSUE THAT YOU'RE RAISING HERE OUR FOCUS IS ON ALIGNING THE VARIOUS SEGMENTS SO WE'RE NOT CALLING OUT OF SPECIFIC WHAT'S DEFINED THANK YOU EQUITY TAX HERE AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE I WAS AS THE L. A. O. NOTES- AND AS WE WORK WITH OUR OUR PARTNERS OVER THE YEARS THEY THEY EACH OF THE SEGMENTS HAS EXISTING EQUITY GOALS. BUT WE DON'T WANT TO SPECIFIED UP FRONT BEFORE THEY CAN GET TOGETHER- THAT'S WHY WE HAVE. A DATE FOR SETTING THESE GOALS A YEAR OUT FROM NOW SO THAT THEY THE SEGMENTS TO WORK TOGETHER TO ALIGN THE DEFINITIONS AND METRICS. SO THAT WE'RE ALL MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND MOVING ON THE SAME TIMELINE SO THAT'S OUR PERSPECTIVE- I'LL PASS IT OFF TO SAY HERE. THANK YOU IN TERMS OF THE UNIVERSITY WE- DO HAVE A PLAN FOR CLOSING EQUITY GAPS- THAT'S OUR FRAMEWORK TWENTY THIRTY GOALS THAT COST SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION- THE WAY WE ARE DEFINING AN EQUITY GAP. IS THE TIME IT TAKES A STUDENT TO GRADUATE SO WHAT WE ARE FINDING IS THOSE STUDENTS ARE PELL ELIGIBLE TAKE LONGER TO GRADUATING STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT FOR EXAMPLE- AND BY CLOSING EQUITY GAPS WE WOULD. TAKE ACTIONS LIKE ADDITIONAL ONE BY USING- HIRING FACULTY TO TEACH BOTTLENECK COURSES AND SO FORTH IT GETS TUDENTS THROUGH FASTER SO THAT THEY'RE GRADUATING. AT THE SAME RATE THAT'S OUR GOAL. THANK YOU AND MY NEXT QUESTION HERE IS RATHER THAN CREATING A NEW DUAL IMMERSION PATHWAY. WHICH WOULD ONLY STIR FIRST TIME FRESHMAN APPLICANTS ARE THERE OTHER WAYS TO STREAMLINE OR EXPAND EXISTING TRANSFER PATHWAYS BETWEEN UC AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND. ONE OF THEIR UC'S A PREFERRED UC'S UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF CLEARLY IDENTIFY TRANSFER COURSES OTHER LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WHY WOULDN'T WE BE ALSO- ADDING THIS TO THE EQUITY GOALS PLAN. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN INCREASE TRANSFERS BASED ON THE EXISTING SYSTEMS AS OUR NEW TRANSFER PATHWAYS PLUS PROGRAM. WHERE THE STUDENT IS GUARANTEED ADMISSION TO SPECIFIC CAMPUS BUT ALSO THROUGH COMPLETING THE TRANSFER PATHWAYS AND- ANY. UC CAMPUS SO LET'S SAY THEY WANT TO GO TO UC IRVINE- AND COMPLETE THE TRANSFER PATHWAY BUT THEN DECIDED THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY RATHER GO TO UC SANTA BARBARA- THEY WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH CAMPUSES SO WE ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE THOSE BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS. OUR FACULTY ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON THIS AND THAT THIS DEBATE TO COMPLETE THE WORK BY TWENTY TWENTY TO- I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN WE GUARANTEED ADMISSION FOR A GROUP OF STUDENTS. IF WE DON'T INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SEATS AVAILABLE IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WHAT WE ARE DOING IS PUSHING SOME STUDENTS AWAY WHILE OTHERS ARE GUARANTEED ADMISSION. SO THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER S. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. REGARDING THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS- IT YOUR NOTED THAT INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS PAY MORE THAN THE COST TO EDUCATE THEM. AND AT I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH THAT THAT WOULD BE SUCH AN IMPORTANT. STATEMENT TO MAKE- THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PAYS FOR THE EDUCATION OF SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS I THINK THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DESERVES TO HAVE GREATER DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMESTO WHAT IS DONE WITH OUR STUDENTS AND WHAT IS DONE ON OUR CAMPUSES I THINK WITH THE QUESTIONS ASKED BY MY COLLEAGUES REGARDING EQUITY I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED. OF THAT THERE ISN'T A MORE DEFINITIVE ANSWER ON WHAT WILL BE DONE TO INCREASE EQUITY ESPECIALLY WITH OURLATINO STUDENTS AND OUR OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS- AS COMPARED TO INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS SO THE- I WILL ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN I KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN ASKED. SPECIFICALLY WHAT WILL BE DONE TO INCREASE EQUITY FOR OUR LATINO AND BLACK STUDENTS. IT SPECIFICALLY WITH ADMISSIONS TO THE UC'S. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- IN REGARDS TO. INCREASING STUDENT EQUITY WE ARE REQUESTING THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP CLOSE GRADUATION GAPS WITH WHICH WE WOULD- HIRE ADDITIONAL ADVISORS- WE FIND THAT STUDENTS ARE FROM LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS DO MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE ROUTINE AND FREQUENT MEETINGS WITH ACADEMIC ADVISORSAND VISORS ON CAMPUS WHO CAN HELP THEM WITH FINANCIAL AID AND BASIC NEEDS. AND ACTIVITIES LIKE THAT- IN THE CURRENT YEAR YOU SEE WAS TAKING ACTIONS TO. UP BUDGETARY SERVICE- WE SHOP EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED PLUS MILLION DOLLAR CUT- IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET AND WE WERE NOT ABLE TO INCREASE SERVICES BECAUSE WE'RE BALANCING- OUR FUNDING BUT WE WERE ABLE TO USE THE SERVICE AND FEDERAL FUNDS TO NOT HAVE IT CUTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THOSE ARE ONE TIME ACTION SO WE DO APPRECIATE THE RESTORATION WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE SERVICES AT OUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY LEVELS FOR OUR STUDENTS- IN ORDER EXPAND SERVICES BECAUSE CAMPUSES ARE ALREADY USING. ALL OF THESE FUNDS WE HAVE VERY LITTLE IN RESERVES- WE DO NEED. MORE FUNDING IN ORDER TO HIRE PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE THE SERVICES WERE VERY PEOPLE BERMAN INSTITUTION- MOST OF OUR FUNDING GOES TO SALARIES AND BENEFITS. AND SO IN ORDER TO INCREASE- THE NUMBER OF COURSES IN ORDER TO INCREASE- NUMBER SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. WE DO NEED TO HIRE PEOPLE IN TERMS OF WHAT IS BEING CURRENTLY FUNDED UNIVERSITY DOES HAVE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS FOR WHOM WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION BERMAN ADMITTED SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. SO THAT- GREATER NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN OUR SYSTEM FOR HOME HAD NO FUNDING. MEANS THAT THERE'S FEWER DOLLARS REALLY PER STUDENT. GOING AROUND THANK YOU. IF I'M MISTER. IF SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT M. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE ANSWER IS. THIS IS THE MONEY WE HAVE IN THIS IS HOW WE'RE CHOOSING TO SPEND IT AND IT'S NOT ON INCREASING EQUITY. I THINK THAT TO WEAR IT WHENEVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUITY AND- WHATEVER WHATEVER DECISION WE MAKE IT HAS TO BE INTENTIONAL IF WE ARE INTENT ON INCREASING THE NUMBER OF LATINO THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WHICH HAVE BEEN UNDER REPRESENTED AT UC'S. THE DECISION HAS TO BE INTENTIONAL AND EVEN WITH WHATEVER THE LIMITED FUNDING IS WHATEVER THE LIMITED BUDGET IS TO SAY THIS IS A PRIORITY AND THIS IS HOW WE WILL SPEND THE MONEY IF WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU RECEIVE IF YOU'RE SAYING IT ISN'T ENOUGH WE CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE OF EQUITY. THEN WHAT WOULD GIVE US THE CONFIDENCE TO BELIEVE THAT IF WE GIVE ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION THAT REGULAR SLEEP IT WILL NOW BE A PRIORITY. I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND I SHARE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE REGARDING THE ARTICLE THE OP ED AND THE BOOK IT THAT HE HAS MENTIONED I THINK THAT THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I'D LIKE TO SEE. MORE INTENTIONALITY MORE OPEN MORE OF AN INTENTIONAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS INCREASING EQUITY. YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING FOR SOME OF THE NEW COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE TOO SO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS SAYING THAT THEY'VE BEEN ROLE THE STUDENTS AND THE NOT ADEQUATELY PAID BY THIS MARGINAL COST- WELL THAT'S THAT'S NOT TRUE AND HERE'S HERE'S THE FAX TWO YEARS AGO WE HAD THIS BOMBSHELL OF AN AUDIT THAT TALKED ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WAS SPLIT SPENDING RESOURCES AND SCROLLING MONEY AWAY THAT WE DID NOT DEEM. WAS APPROPRIATE WHEN WE HAD ALL THESE OTHER NEEDS THAT WHEN WE BOIL DOWN TO IT WE FOUND THAT THERE WERE SOME OF THAT WAS ONE TIME SOME OF THAT WAS ON GOING. SO WHAT WE DID IS WE RE DIRECTED SOME OF THAT MONEY FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. COUPLED WITH NEW MONEY GENERAL FUND MONEY TO FUND ON GOING. TO ENROLLMENT WHICH WAS THAT THE ADEQUATE. MARGINAL COST YOU SEE SAYS THAT WAS UNFAIR THEY ARE RE LITIGATING- PRIOR BUDGET TWO YEARS AGO SO PLEASE DON'T CONFUSE US- WE KNOW EXACTLY THAT YOU ARE COVERED THAT THE AT THE AMOUNT. YOU THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA ISN'T LIKE A DECISION THAT THAT WAS MADE. BUT YOU ARE RECEIVING MONEY THERE IS MONEY FROM THE UNIVERSITY WHICH WAS REDIRECTED. PLUS NEW GENERAL FUND MONEY TO COVER. THE MARGINAL COST FOR EACH ADDITIONAL STUDENTS SO. THANK YOU MISTER LEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ASEAN SEE HOW I HAVE SOME RAPID FIRE QUESTIONS ARE GONNA BE QUICK SHORT ANSWERS SO. I WAS VERY WITH ME ON THIS. IS IT ACCURATE TO SAY THAT A RESIDENT PER YEAR THE AVERAGE TUITION AND FEES OF PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA'S FOR FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ROUGHLY. FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THIS IS THE RIGHT FEES ARE TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS FOR TUITION AND STUDENT SERVICES AND EACH CAMPUS HAS CERTAIN CAMPUS BASED FEES. BY CAMPUS RIGHT TO THE AVERAGE WOULD BE AROUND FORTY THOUSAND AND THEN IS IT ALSO ACTED TO SAY THE AVERAGE. SYSTEMWIDE NONRESIDENT TUITION AND FEES A YEAR IS FORTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS. FORTY THREE HUNDRED. THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT AND WOULD BE ACTED TO SAY DOESN'T COST. TO EDUCATE A NON RESIDENT OUT OF STATE OR INTERNATIONAL THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS A RESIDENT CALIFORNIA CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT WE REQUEST- ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ELEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM THE STATE FOR MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION THAT'S THE STATE SHARE ON TOP OF THE TUITION- FOR WHAT. WHAT WE ESTIMATED COST TO EDUCATE A STUDENT RIGHT. AND COMING FROM A STUDENT ADVOCATE REALM ONLY FOUR YEARS AGO THE UC SYSTEM I RARELY AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BUT IS WOULD IT BE ACCURATE TO SAY THE MISSION OF YOU SEE WHAT WE ACCURATE TO SAY THAN THAT. ETHNONYM COMING IN DOES NOT TAKE A SEAT AWAY FROM A RESIDENT STUDENT BUT BRINGS INTO OTHER STATES. THAT IS CORRECT OUR NON RESIDENT STUDENTS HELP PAY FOR RESIDENT INSTRUCTION. WE DO HAVE. MORE RESIDENT INSTRUCTION CURRENTLY AND THEN- WE THINK WOULD BE COVERED NECESSARILY- EIGHT NON RESIDENTS ARE PAYING ABOUT 15% OF OUR CAMPUS BUDGETS WHICH HELPS PAY FOR SERVICES TO OUR RESIDENT POPULATION AS WELL RIGHT AND WITH ACADEMIC COUNSELING DOES THAT COME OUT OF THE TUITION AND FEES STUDENTS PAY ACADEMIC HOUSING THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY FOR HELPING. ME COUNSELING CAN BE PAID FOR WITH A MIX OF STATE GENERAL FUND AND TUITION. BURKE SO I BRING UP I HIGHLIGHT THAT FACT ONLY BECAUSE COMING FROM THAT WORLD I WAS IN ONLY A COUPLE YEARS AGO IS THAT. SO I DEFINITELY AGREE WE NEED TO BE STEPPING UP AND PROVIDING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY MAKING SURE THEY'RE TRANSFERRING FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL. BUT I'M DON'T DISAGREE ABOUT GROWING NON NON STATE AND NON RESIDENT. SAN ROMAN AS LONG AS IT IS BALANCED IN THEIR APPROACH AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH SEATS FOR EVERYONE. THE REAL PROBLEM THAT I'VE SEEN ON CAMPUSES AS WE GROW TOO QUICKLY AND THOSE WHERE LIMITED RESOURCES ON THE CAMPUSES. AND SAYS AND TO THE FACT THAT IT'S A- BLACK AND BROWN STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING. SEVERAL PERCENTAGE POINTS MUCH LOWER THAN OTHER STUDENTS IS INDICATIVE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS AND ESPECIALLY AS TO HOW YOU NOTICE BEFORE THEY YOU KNOW TO BEFORE IS LACK OF ADVISING ELECT OUR LACK OF ADVISING AND THE INCREASE IN BOTTLENECK OF COURSES. THE REAL PROBLEM I'VE SEEN BEFORE AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU FIX THAT IN THE FRANKLY THE THREE YEARS I'VE HAD BEEN THERE. BUT IT IS A PROBLEM OF THEIR TOO MANY STUDENTS TRYING TO GET IN THE SAME CLASSES TOO MANY STUDENTS TRYING TO ACCESS THE SAME THE SAME RESOURCES AND YET THE UC HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FUND THOSE RESOURCES ADEQUATELY OUR FUNDERS CLASS OFFERINGS ADEQUATELY. SO THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU MISS ONE CRITICAL REQUIRED CLASS YOU COULD BE SET BACK ONE YEAR REPORT PLUS AND THAT DELAY THE GRADUATION RATE AND OFTEN. AND I HAD MANY FIGHTS WITH MY LOCAL MEASURES ABOUT HOW THE EVEN PRIORITIZE HOW YOU SELECT CLASSES WHERE YOU ARE ON THE WAIT LIST THAT REALLY SCREWS YOU OVER. BECAUSE IF YOU MISS ONE CLASS YOU COULD BE SET BACK TWO YEARS PAYING YOU KNOW SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE- EVEN JUST THE REPORT COSTS- SO. WELL I JUST. AT THE COVER. ABOUT EQUITY IN ADDING TO ABOUT THE ROLE PIECES BECAUSE- I. I'M NOT OPPOSED TO HAVING MORE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS AS LONG AS IT IS OFF OF COURSE ACT WILL BALLOTS WITH OUR- ON OUR COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIANS- I THINK FRANKLY HAVING MORE SINCE FROM AROUND THE WORLD IS. CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND YOU SEE I KNOW WAS TO MINE. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE BALANCE THAT. IT'S NOT GREAT THAT AND I KNOW A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS DEFINITELY FEEL AS THOUGH THEY ARE THE CASH COWS OF. OF YOU SEE THE UPDATE VERY MUCH KNOW THAT THEY ARE PAYING THREE TIMES AS MUCH BUT IT'S ALSO SELECTED FOR THE KINDS OF INTERNATIONAL SINCE WE CAN HAVE AS WELL- ONE OF COURSE. WE ARE EVERYTHING CALIFORNIA'S NOT DRAFT SINCE TOLD TOTALLY I THINK IT'S PARTY EQUATION- BUT DEFINITELY. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UC IS COMMITTED TO THESE THINGS AND LOOKING AT IT VERY CLOSELY. SO IF YOU ARE ABLE TO COME BACK TO US AS MR GALLAGHER HAD COURSE OF ACTION ITEMS. TALK ABOUT WHAT THE UC IS GOING TO DO ABOUT. GETTING MORE ACADEMIC COUNSELING AND ACADEMIC ADVISING ESPECIALLY TO LONG CONCERNS AND SENSE OF COLOR. AND ALSO ABOUT HOW YOU'RE ADDRESSING THE BOTTLENECKS SHORTAGES CLASSES BECAUSE THAT IS A PROBLEM. IN THE U. SEASON OF COURSE ALTERCATION. EDUCATION SECTORS. WHERE TOO MANY STUDENTS ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE ONE SAME CLASS. SO I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE HOW YOU CAN COME BACK AND TALK TO US ABOUT ADVISING AND THE BOTTLENECK COURSES AS WELL. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. AND MOSTLY OUT I WILL KNOW THAT IT THAT WE LIKE TO SAY IT'S MORE OF A RATIO THAN A CAT. BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT. IF IT IF WE HAVE A CAP. FIRST THEN THAT'S THE FINITE NUMBER. BUT WE FOR S. FOR EVERY. READ THE ENROLL MUST ENROLL ROUGHLY. FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IT'S DIFFERENT PER CAMPUS IN SELMA- WE THINK THAT THAT WAS A FAIR COMPROMISE. IS GOING FORWARD I KNOW THAT. THAT THAT THAT I KNOW THE SENATE- IS LOOKING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER- IN THAT RATIO TO MR TING A SOME THOUGHTS IN A SECOND AS WELL SO. BUT IT'S MORE OF A RATIO THAT THAN A CAP JUST WANNA CLARIFY THEIR SENSE OF TRYING TO FIND READ THAT. IT'S ABOUT BRING MORE SEATS IN TOGETHER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TAKE. I THINK WITH CHAIR- I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK TO MY COLLEAGUE INCENTIVES. COMMENTED I WILL BE. WANT TO MAKE A- SLIGHT. ON THEN HE MADE A POINT I THINK YOU AGREED. THAT FOR EVERY OUT OF STATE STUDENT. THAT IN ESSENCE THEY PAY FOR. TO IN STATE STUDENTS IS THAT IS IT WOULD YOU WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT. YES THAT'S CORRECT EACH NON RESIDENT STUDENT BASED ON SALES AND ONE POINT SIX. RESIDENTS STUDENTS SUBMARGINAL COSTS OF INSTRUCTION I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE WITH THE UNIVERSITY BETWEEN THE YEARS OF. TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. I WAS AT A CAMPUS BUDGET OFFICE OF THAT TIME PERFECT SO YOU'RE YOU'RE AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON DOWN. ON THE DURING THAT TIME YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE DIRECT NUMBERS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME BUT I'M- OUT OF STATE ENROLLMENT GREW SIGNIFICANTLY I THINK THREE OR FOUR. WE ARE FOR FULL DUTY RECOLLECT HOW HOW MUCH IN STATE ENROLLMENT GREW DURING THAT TIME. LET'S SEE DURING- DURING THE DURING THAT TIME- IN STATE ENROLLMENT- WHAT'S LET'S SEE IT WAS- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND STATE OH SORRY I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME- BUT I DO BELIEVE WE GREW IN STATE ENROLLMENT AT THAT TIME. I YEAH ARE YOU A LOT YEAH I THINK IF YOU ARMED. BY LAW IF YOU MEAN NOTHING AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT WAS- SO DID THE NUMBERS ADOPTABLE REFLECT BECAUSE I MEAN I WOULD I WAS ON THIS COMMITTEE STARTING IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SO I RECOLLECT ALL THOSE DISCUSSIONS. ON AND- USING YOUR LARGER OR LIKE IT'S MY COLLEAGUES LOGIC THAT YOU'RE FROM WE HAD A FIVE FOLD INCREASE IN- HOW TO STAY IN. A ROOM AND WE SHOULD HAVE A TENER. YOU KNOW. TEN OR- OR FORTY IN INSTEAD ENROLLMENT BUT YET WE DIDN'T SEE THAT. IN FACT OWNED. WE SAW IN STATE ENROLLMENT R. AS MY MOST COMPETITIVE CAMPUSES. UC BERKELEY UCLA AND SAN DIEGO GO DOWN. I CAN'T CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE PERCENT OF ASK STUDENTS AT BERKELEY UCLA AND SAN DIEGO ARE NOW. I ONLY HAVE THE SYSTEM WHAT WELL- AT AT BERKELEY SAN DIEGO AND AWAY OUT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ARE ALLOWED TO BE- AT THE RATE AT THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE WHEN THE CAP WAS. NOT IF I'M JUST ALSO THEY ARE I'M JUST ASKING I KNOW WHAT THE POLICY IS MANNED BY HELP WRITE IT SO. YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME THE NUMBER. I CAN GET THAT FOR YOUR OFFICE I DON'T HAVE IT HERE IN FRONT OF ME. I WILL SAY THAT BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. YOU SEE A ROLE- ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES THAT WE RECEIVED MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION FUNDING FOR. FROM THE LEGISLATURE SO WE DO TRY TO MAKE YOUR WISHES AND KEEP UP WITH THAT ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN BLACK MATTER THIS IS A JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY BUT- BOTH RURAL DIRECTLY PAID FOR OUT OF THE STATE BUDGET IN THROUGH NEGOTIATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE. I'LL WHY DIDN'T THE FORTY FOUR HUNDRED INCREASE IN NONRESIDENT STUDENT- ALSO INCREASE COMMENSURATELY. AN INCREASE IN NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT. SO FROM THE MONEY WE- ADDED TO THE BUDGET. WE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS FROM- NON RESIDENTS THAT WE GET TO HELP PAY FOR SERVICES FOR ALL STUDENTS ON CAMPUS SO IT'S INCREASING- VARIOUS TYPES OF SERVICES AND INCREASING COURSES FOR ALL STUDENTS- IS HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE USED IF WE RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR NON RESIDENTS DON'T USE THAT MUCH. BUT AT WELL OTHER NON RESIDENTS COUNCILLORS TO THERE'S NO THERE'S NO LINK BETWEEN NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT IN IN. STATE ENROLLMENT FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. IS THERE. THE LINK IS THAT- WE GET WE ARE ABLE TO PAY FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES ON ALL OUR ALL OUR CAMPUSES CURRENTLY ABOUT 15% OF NUMBERS BUDGETS THE SYSTEM WIDE COME FROM NON RESIDENT TUITION THAT'S JUST THE EXTRA PAYMENT THAT NONRESIDENT STUDENTS MAKE- BECAUSE WE SPEND THAT ON ALL KINDS OF SERVICES ON THE CAMPUS ALL STUDENTS END UP BENEFITING FROM WORK RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT SO SILVA SO THE BENEFIT COULD BE TO THE STUDENTS QUALITY OF LIFE. BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN INCREASED ACCESS. WE DON'T- ADMIT NEW RESIDENTS STUDENTS- WHEN WE ARE ADMITTING NON RESIDENTS THE WE DO STATE OF THE STATE OF THE CAP LEVELS BUT WE DON'T- WE DON'T NECESSARILY LANDED TWO ONE ROMANS TO GATHER IF THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH BUSINESS ARE LOOKING AT THE LEVELS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THAT THEY THEY WANT TO HAVE AND THEN- WE HAVE THE ADMISSIONS DECISIONS FOR THE TWO SEPARATELY SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE ADMIT OUR RESIDENTS. AND THEN GO ON RESIDENTS TO CORRESPOND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE THERE TO SUPPORT FOR THREE IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE NUMBERS OKAY CAN YOU TELL US WHY IN FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN- YOU SEE EXCEEDED THE 18% GOAL WITH THE TWENTY ONE PERCENT- IN ROMAN OF NONRESIDENTS. WE HAVE A HEARING LOSS YEAR SO THAT'S WHEN WE CAN GET THAT BECAUSE- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION STARK- ADMISSIONS DECISIONS ARE VERY DIFFICULT AND THAT. WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT THE YIELD WILL BE STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH OFFERS. AND WE MAKE- PREDICTIONS ABOUT HOW MANY WILL ACCEPT THOSE OFFERS. BASED ON PRIOR YEAR AVERAGES. AND THEN SOME YEARS CAMPUSES DO OVERSHOOTS SLIGHTLY. IN TWENTY NINETEEN YOU'RE CORRECT THERE WERE. YOUR CAMPUSES THAT HAD- A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVER INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR NON RESIDENTS- WE TOOK THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING AWAY FROM THEM. AND WE DISTRIBUTED IT SYSTEM WIDE FOR STUDENT BASIC NEEDS. OR OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. OKAY BUT LET'S LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT WITH 3% OF THAT NUMBER IS IT'S ALMOST SIXTY SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. SO THAT'S NOT. WELL I'M JUST TAKING 3% YOU YOU GIVE ME OF KIND OF YOUR EYES POPPED. 3% OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX THOUSAND THE JUNE ROLLED IF WE RE DID THE RATIO. THAT RESULTS IN THE FIRST 3% MULTIPLIED BY TWO TWENTY SIX OF SIXTY SEVEN EIGHTY THREE. RIGHT SIR I THINK THE OVER AND ROLAND WAS CLOSER TO TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS OVERALL SYSTEM WIDE. I I WILL GET THOSE NUMBERS FOR YOUR OFFICE OKAY ARE YOU. DISCUSSING WITH ABOUT THE NUMBER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TALKING ABOUT ALL THE THEY'RE ENTIRE CAMPUS AND WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWED IS YEAH THERE ARE SOME CAMPUSES BECAUSE THEY ARE THEIR CAP IS HIGHER THAN 18% YES THEY DO. IN ROLL UP MORE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS AND CAMPUSES THAT HAVE A CAP OF EIGHTEEN. RIGHT RIGHT NO I UNDERSTAND BUT THE WE'RE TRYING TO PUT THE OVERALL THE OVERALL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS SUPPOSED TO BE 18% WHEN THE REGION'S ADOPTED THE GAP THEY ALLOW CAMPUSES THAT WERE ALREADY ABOVE THE 18% LEVEL TO. CONTINUE TO ENROLL THE NUMBER OF NON RESIDENTS THAT THEY WERE ROLLING WHEN THE COP WAS ADOPTED AND THAT'S WHY THERE ARE SOME CAMPUSES THAT ARE ABOVE THAT EIGHT. THAT WAS THE AGREEMENT WE WITH- UNIVERSITY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN OVERALL NOT TO EXCEED 18% IT WASN'T SO THAT. THREE THE THREE THAT WERE HIGHER BERKELEY UCLA SAN DIEGO WHICH WERE ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT. WERE ALLOWED TO REMAIN HARD THAT IS CORRECT BUT THE OVERALL TARGET FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. KNOWING THAT SOME CAMPUSES LIKE MERCED. ASIDE WOULD NOT WOULD NOT REALLY GET ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT EIGHTEEN PERCENT- AND SO SEEING A 21% NUMBER IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN. CAN WE CAN WE UNDERSTAND WHAT CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN BY THE UNIVERSITY. THE UNIVERSITY HAS CAP CURRENTLY ARE ABOUT 80% YEAH I THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THAT- THEN- TARGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS A NON RESIDENT- TARGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WHAT'S WHAT ARE YOUR WHAT ARE YOUR MOMENT TARGETS FOR RESIDENTS NON RESIDENTS IN TOTALS FOR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE PLAN THE WHOLE- ENROLLMENT FLAT. OR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. ACADEMIC YEAR. WHICH MEANS WE WOULD AND MAKE ROUGHLY THE SAME- NUMBER AND RATIO STUDENTS AS WE DID FOR FALL ONE TWENTY. GUNS TO SEE YOU SEE YOU YOU ANTICIPATED ROLLING ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS AGAIN ROUGHLY. AND OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW IT'S NOT A PERFECT SCIENCE. YES AN UNDERGRADUATE YES CORRECT. RIGHT SO OFTEN. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO AND BURKE CAMPUSES ADDICTION TO NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. SIR IF WE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF NON RESIDENTS WILL LOSE FUNDING FOR THOSE CAMPUSES AND SO- WE WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE TRUSTED BUDGET CUTS TO OUR CAMPUSES- WE- IF WE HAD. CUTS FOR MULTIPLE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS CANVASES WOULD HAVE TO CUT STUDENT SERVICES THEY WOULD HAVE TO CUT THE NUMBER OF COURSES AVAILABLE AND IT WOULD MAKE THINGS WORSE FOR ALL STUDENTS- WE DID SUBMIT A PLAN TO YOU ARE YOU YEARS AGO I BELIEVE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. OR REDUCING NON RESIDENTS- AND AT THAT TIME FOUND THAT IT COULD BE TREMENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE- DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE REDUCTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YEAH BETWEEN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO BILLIONS. RIGHT BUT THAT THAT WAS IF YOU IF YOU TOOK IT DOWN ALL THE WAY I THINK TO. FIVE OR 10% BUT NOTHING THING GRADUALLY OVER TIME. I'M I THINK I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS YOU NOW HAVE- NINE CHANCELLORS OR I GUESS I WOULD SAY SEVEN CHANCELLORS. WHO- THIS IS THE ONLY AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETE DISCRETION OVER. SO THEY HAVE EVERY INCENTIVE TO FOCUS AND BRING IN NON RESIDENT ROMAN BECAUSE IT'S THEIR ONLY DISCRETIONARY POT OF MONEY I MEAN YOU YOU MENTIONED YOU WERE OUT YOU WERE AT A CAMPUS BUDGET OFFICE WHICH CAMPUS WHERE YOU WERE. I WAS AT UC DAVIS AND THEN IF YOU SEE BERKELEY WONDERFUL SO WHAT WOULD YOU WOULD YOU SAY THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE ONLY POTS OF MONEY THAT DAVIS OR BERKELEY. HAD THAT WAS COMPLETELY UP TO THE CHANCELLOR'S DISCRETION- THERE'S A STATE MONIES APPROPRIATE BY FORMULA THE TO THE FEE MONEY IS THE FEMALE NAME. THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY WAYS THAT THEY COULD GET ADDITIONAL REVENUE ON CAMPUS. IN IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY. I WOULD SAY THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT CERTAIN THESE BONDS ARE WHAT WE USED TO CALL FUNGIBLE THAT IS- THE CAMPUS GOING TO SUSPEND THEM ON ANY COURT CAMPUS ACTIVITY. SO THE CHANCELLOR HAVE. NO INCENTIVE EFFECTIVE HUGE DISINCENTIVE TO REDUCE NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT. THE CHANCELLOR'S WANT TO MAINTAIN FISCAL HEALTH OF THEIR CAMPUSES AND- WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO INCREASE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES- I THINK THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN THE ONES THAT THEY HAVE YES SO THIS IN IN THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY FUNDING SOURCES THEY COULD GOING CHRIS. SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE THE 18% CAP SO- THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO INCREASES FUNDING SOURCE TREMENDOUSLY BUT- YES THIS IS ONE OF THE FUNDING SOURCES ARE CAMPUSES SOURCE AVAILABLE FOR INCREASED- BETWEEN SAY TWENTY TEN. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN YEAH SO SINCE THE CHURCHILL MCCARTY MENTIONED- THIS WILL BE AN ISSUE THAT WE WITH REVISITING THE BUDGET THIS YEAR NOT AN ABSOLUTE WILL BE- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT OVER. THE LONG RUN UC NEEDS TO REDUCE THAT FIGURE DOWN TO TEN OR EVEN BACK 25% IN TERMS OF. OUT OF STATE ENROLLMENT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT CAN BE DONE IS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND- THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES IN FIND DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND. ON ENROLLMENT AT THE DIFFERENT AT THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO. HAVE THAT DISCUSSION I WANTED TO GO BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS FROM SAN BERNARD DINO INTER RIVERSIDE FOR THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT THE UNIVERSITY'S ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR ACTIVE CLOSE THE EQUITY GAP- WHAT IS THE- YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE- GRADUATION TARGETS. FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS THAT THIS. THAT THAT IF WE YOU THE- SIXTY MILLION WHAT WOULD BE CALLED THE- GRADUATION GAP FOR LATINO AFRICAN AMERICANS THAN TELEGRAM RECIPIENTS. WHAT'S THE GOLDEN. AND OVER WHAT TIME- THANK YOU SIR THE- GOAL WOULD BE TO FULLY CLOSE THE GRADUATION BY TWENTY THIRTY SO WOULD BE TO BRING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LAST NEXT- REGULATION RATES THE SAME LEVEL AS OF THE STUDENTS WHO CURRENTLY DON'T RECEIVE PELL GRANTS AND WHO ARE- CAUCASIAN. SO FOR A PROGRAM RECIPIENT THE GOAL WOULD BE TO GET TO THE 67% ASSUMING THEY DIDN'T INCREASE AND THEN FOR. FOR LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICANS THE GOAL WOULD BE TO GET TO. SOMEWHERE AROUND. SEVENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX YOU KNOW SERVICE AND PERCENT. FORM I'M LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES. RIGHT FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS FOR ALL- YOU SEE STUDENTS- SO THE OUR GRADUATION RATE OR- THESE- SECOND. OUR CUSTOM THINK I HAVE I OF OUR YEAR OLD WHITE CAUCASIAN 73% API'S SIX LATINOS FIFTY EIGHT AFRICAN AMERICANS FIFTY FOUR PROGRAMS TO BE INSTRUCTED SEVEN A NON PROGRAM RECIPIENTS SIXTY SEVEN. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I JUST WANT TO GET THIS ON THE RECORD AS YOU WERE TRYING TO GET LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS TO BETWEEN 73276% LET'S SAY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. BY TWENTY THIRTY AND ROUGHLY 67% FOR PELL GRANT. RECIPIENTS BY TWENTY THREE. THAT IS CORRECT- AND WE ARE WE WERE ESTIMATING THAT WE WOULD NEED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN ORDER TO FULFILL THAT GOAL. OUR REQUEST THAT WAS THANK YOU. OKAY SO YOU NEED THE MONEY ANNUALLY THAT'S NOT A ONE TIME EXPENDITURE. YES THAT THAT'S ALL I'M GOING BINDING AND IT WOULD BE FOLDING UP SIXTY MILLION THE FIRST YEAR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THE NEXT YEAR. AND HUNDRED EIGHTY YEAR AFTER. DO YOU EVER BREAK UP I CAMPUS OF HOW THE MONEY GETS SPENT. I DO HAVE- YES WE HAVE CAMPUS PLANS. FOR HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE SPENT- I DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AT THE MOMENT BUT I CAN GET THAT. FOR YOU. IT DOES THAT DOES THAT BREAK OUT IN SPENDING ACTUALLY REFLECT THE DISTRIBUTION OF LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS BECAUSE- BECAUSE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE MENTIONED. DISTRIBUTION IS AN EQUAL KNOCKS THE NINE CAMPUSES. WE CAN DEFINITELY. YOU ARE CLOSING EQUITY GAPS BASED ON DU CAMPUSES IN A MOMENT WHERE THE EQUITY GAPS ACTUALLY EXISTS. NO NO NO WE DON'T YOU CAN DO THIS QUESTIONS WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO AND HOW YOU DO IT. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A THERE'S NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM WITH YOU CAN DO THINGS THAT THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN GETTING YOU TO DO THINGS. WE WILL DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS BASED ON WHERE THE EQUITY GAPS ARE. IF YOU PROVIDE US WITH THE CLOSING OF EQUITY GAPS FUNDING THAT WE REQUESTED. GREAT THANK YOU SO OFTEN. JUST SO YOU'RE PREPARED I THINK YOU SHOULD- START THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW REDUCTION IN NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE- WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE AND THEN YOU I THINK YOU I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO START THINKING ABOUT- NUMBERS ABOUT HOW HOW YOU WOULD. ABSORB THAT ARE OR WHAT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO ASSIST YOU WITH THAT THE END AGAIN THAT PERCENTAGE CAN GO DOWN IF YOU INCREASED THE CALIFORNIA STATE IN ROME DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN THAT YOU DECREASE NONRESIDENT ROMAN JUST MEET YOU COULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE INSTEAD A ROLL. SO THAT THAT THAT WILL DEFINITELY BE PART OF OUR DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE FIFTEENTH SEVEN THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU WE WANT TO TRY TO MOVE ON THE AGENDA BUT GO BACK TO MR MEDINA SAID DO YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS THERE I KNOW THE NOT THE MOST RECENT NUMBERS FOR NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT FOR THE NINE CAMPUS WE KNOW THAT LA BERKELEY. AND SAN DIEGO ARE BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY FOUR AS YOU SAID AND- THE IRVINE INSTANT DAVIS THAT IS CAN GO UP TO EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS OUR POLICY AND THAT THE NUMBER THAT CAMPUS IS AT THE BOTTOM AND- THEN RIVERSIDE. MERCED. AND SANTA CRUZ WHAT WERE THEIR NUMBERS. I DON'T HAVE THE BY CAMPUS NON RESIDENT INVOLVEMENT IN FRONT OF ME I DO BELIEVE IT'S WRONG FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BALD WHEN PLANNING WITHOUT. YEAH MS. BUT BUT- I'M A CONTRACTOR AND UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S MINIMAL THE NUMBER. OF OUT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS S. N. UC RIVERSIDE I THINK FOR JOBS INTERNATIONAL. IS PRETTY MINIMAL IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER CAMPUSES. YES SIR I BELIEVE THAT- MERCED THERE ARE ALMOST NO INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS THERE'S VERY FEW MERCED AND IT RIVERSIDE THE NUMBER IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER CAMPUSES. YEAH YES SIR WE HAVE HERE- MR DENTAL AND OUR GENDER FROM TWENTY NINETEEN SINCE TWO YEARS AGO AND I THINK IT'S THE SAME SOBRE OF BERKELEY WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE UCLA WAS TWENTY FOUR- SAN DIEGO WAS TWENTY THREE- THAT THE THREE IN THE MID MIDDLE THE POLICY WAS THEY CAN GO 218% SO THAT WAS IRVINE. AS AT NINETEEN DAVIS AT EIGHTEEN- AND IN SANTA BARBARA AT SIXTEEN THAT THREE AT THE BOTTOM. WE'RE AND WE'RE RIVERSIDE AT 4%MERCED IS AT 0% IN SANTA CRUZ AT 11% SO WELL UNDER TEN AYE MAYBE THEY'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT BUT AND WELL UNDER TEN AND VERY LOW JUST JUST TO YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S- NECESSARY TO KEEP IT IN PERSPECTIVE. THAT THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE. ARE MINIMAL AT THAT THE OTHER CAMPUSES. ON ON THE POINT OF EQUITY IT IS ALSO- THERE'S SOME IRONY THAT THE CAMPUSES LIKE RIVERSIDE THAT ARE UNDERFUNDED ARE DOING BETTER WITH EQUITY- WHERE THE GRADUATION RATE FOR LATINO ARE PROBABLY BETTER HIGHER. AT UC RIVERSIDE EVEN THOUGH IT'S UNDER FUNDED THAN AT OTHER CAMPUSES. OKAY THANK YOU SO LET'S. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO- THAT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN OF COURSE AND EXPECT ACTION FROM THE TO THE ASSEMBLY ON THESE TWO ISSUES- IN A FEW MONTHS I SHOULD NEVER TO STUDENTS SUPPORTING BASIC NEEDS PROPOSAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS TO BE PROPOSALS FOR STUDENTS SUPPORT THE FIRST IS. FIFTEEN MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. OUR BASIC NEEDS FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY ACCESS AND MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES STUDENTS THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE EXISTING FIFTEEN MILLION ONGOING THAT YOU SEE CURRENTLY RECEIVES FOR FOOD AND HOUSING BASIC NEEDS. THE OTHER PROPOSAL AND STUDENT SUPPORT IS FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME EMERGENCY STUDENT FINANCIAL AID. WE ARE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU L. L. FROM OUR MESSAGE HERE IS SOMETHING YOU'LL HEAR A LOT FROM US DURING TODAY'S HEARING WHICH IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED OBJECTIVES AND GOALS THAT ARE REASONABLE AND TIMELY BUT WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS I JUST IF IN CASE IT'S HELPFUL TO FOLLOW ALONG PAGE ELEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA. HAS TWO BULLETS THAT SITE THE TWO PROPOSALS IN THIS ISSUE. I'M GOING TO REACH BALL AT OUR CONCERNS WITH- THE HOUSE FIFTEEN MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. IS THAT IT COMBINES TWO DIFFERENT. ISSUES STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND STERN TECHNOLOGY NEEDS. WITHOUT HAVING TO NECESSARILY CLEAR NEXUS WITH THESE TWO OBJECTIVES. JUST FOR EXAMPLE STOOD MENTAL HEALTH IS SOMETHING THAT THE UNIVERSITY IN RECENT YEARS HAS PROVIDED FUNDING PORTAGE RAMPED UP FUNDING FOR OVERTIME SO THIS IS EFFECTIVELY AN EXISTING PROGRAM. BUT THEY UNIVERSITY THE STATE HAS NOT FUNDED A SYSTEM WIDE STUDENT TECHNOLOGY- INITIATIVE BEFORE SO THIS WOULD BE A NEW ISSUE. SO IN THIS CASE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF THIS PROPOSAL AND POTENTIALLY TACKLE EACH ISSUE SEPARATELY. ON THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. I'M HERE THE ISSUE WAS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THESE FUNDS WOULD INTERACT WITH THE MUCH LARGER AMOUNT OF FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDING FOR STUDENT EMERGENCY AID ALL THE SEGMENTS HAVE RECEIVED EMERGENCY EMERGENCY FINANCE FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY STUDENT AID AND TWO SEPARATE ROUNDS. AND ARE POTENTIALLY SLATED TO RECEIVE EVEN MORE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING UNDER THIRD ROUND. WE RECOMMEND YOU EVALUATE THE PROPOSED A TWO MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND IN LIGHT OF THIS FEDERALLY FUNDING. SOME INFORMATION YOU COULD GATHER IN THE COMING MONTHS WOULD BE TO HAVE THE UNIVERSITIES PROVIDE MORE. DATA AND INFORMATION ARMED STUDENT FINANCIAL NEED OF REMAINING NEED AFTER FACTORING YOU DISH THE- FEDERAL RESPONDS. AND THEN TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RESTORE MEANING FINANCIAL NEEDS OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD GET INFORMATION FROM YOU SEE ANY OTHER SEGMENTS AS TO HOW IT INTENDS TO SPEND THESE FEDERAL DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT ANY STATE FUNDING IS COORDINATED. AND A COVERING- I THINK FILLING ANY GAPS THAT REMAIN. APPARENTLY FINALLY OUR ANALYSIS ON STUDENT BASIC NEEDS IDENTIFIED SOME OVERARCHING CONCERNS WE'VE HAD WITH THE STATE'S EXISTING APPROACH ON THE STATE HAS IDENTIFIED BASIC NEEDS AS A BUDGET PRIORITY IN RECENT YEARS BUT HASN'T- DEVELOPED A LONG TERM STRATEGY AND MANY OF THE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED IN PREVIOUS YEARS HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT PIECEMEAL AND NOT WALK COORDINATED WITH THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE SOME STEPS THIS YEAR TO ESTABLISH A MORE COMPREHENSIVE. STRATEGY TO ADDRESS STUDENT BASIC NEEDS. FOR THE SAKE OF TIME I'D BE I'D BE HAPPY TO ELABORATE MORE ON THAT IN JUNE IF THAT'S OF INTEREST TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME BACK TO YOU EARLY ON A SECOND. YOU SEE. SAY OVER TEN PER UNIVERSITY UP. WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FIFTEEN MILLION AN ONGOING BASIC NEEDS SUPPORT FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESS AS WELL AS THE FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY STUDENT FINANCIAL AID WE REQUEST FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THESE FUNDS. I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS OUR DEEP APPRECIATION TO THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR PER FUNDING RECEIVED IN PRIOR YEARS. ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO ESTABLISH INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESSES USED WITH WHICH TO SERVE STUDENTS. ONGOING FUNDING ALLOWS UNIVERSITY THE PLAN FOR HOW TO COVER STUDENT NEEDS ALLOWS TO DO MORE TO ADDRESS STUDENTS AND CRISES THE PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTED THE UC STUDENT BASIC NEEDS EXTEND BEYOND HOUSING AND FOOD SECURITY NEEDS LIKE TECHNOLOGY AND MENTAL HEALTH. WE WOULD USE THAT THEIR BASIC NEEDS FUNDING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR TO HIRE ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS FOR OUR CAMPUSES PROVIDE TARGETED MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSES SUCH AS SCREENING TOOLS PROACTIVE CYCLE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS AND OUTREACH EFFORTS DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH CULTURAL AFFINITY GROUPS. AND OTHER STUDENTS SERVICE PROGRAMS ON OUR CAMPUSES IN ADDITION THE STUDENT TECHNOLOGY FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES SUCH AS PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH TECHNOLOGY LIKE LAPTOPS AND HOTSPOT BY. GRANTS FOR HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS AS WELL AS THE PURCHASE A LEARNING ACCESSIBILITY SOFTWARE TO SERVE OUR DISABLED STUDENTS. I WANT TO EXTEND OUR THANKS THE LEGISLATURE FORTY EARLY ACTION BILL AB EIGHTY FIVE WHICH APPROVED SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE CURRENT YEAR INCREASE STUDENT ENROLLMENT IN CALFRESH THESE FUNDS WILL OUR CAMPUSES TO HIRE STUDENT WORKERS. PURCHASE EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE UNDERTAKE OTHER ACTIONS TO HELP STUDENTS WITH THE APPLICATION PROCESS. BECAUSE WE'RE A PUBLIC INSTITUTION THAT STRIVES TO SERVE STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS WE ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE BASIC NEEDS ISSUES. PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH BASIC NEEDS SAFETY THAT ALLOWS UNIVERSITIES AND SHORT THAT CAME IN COLLEGE. EDUCATION POSSIBLE FOR STUDENTS FOR OUR LIST OF THEIR LIVES. THANK YOU FOR THE TO SPEAK TODAY. OKAY THE YOU CAN I GO BACK TO THE L. A. L. THAT JASON WHO WHAT WE WERE YOU FOR THE THESE BASS I'M OBVIOUSLY THIS CAN MAKE- AND THEY SIMPLY THAT WE WITH THE IN THE INCLUDE OF A BASIC NEED LINE ITEMS FOR. A MENTAL HEALTH FOOD HOUSING THESE ARE ALL PRIORITIES THAT THAT HAVE ONLY BECOME EXASPERATED DURING COVER NINETEEN ARE YOU SAYING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE LESS- LESS FLEXIBILITY AND HAVE THESE LINE ITEMS OR HAVE MORE FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY HAVE LIKE A BLOCK GRANT PER PER CAMPUS BASED UPON THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. BOTH BOTH APPROACHES ARE OUR OPTIONS TO CONSIDER. THE MAIN REASON TO DO THE BLOCK GRANT APPROACH- COULD BE IF CAMPUSES FACE CERTAIN- DIFFERENT BASIC NEEDS ISSUES MAYBE MENTAL HEALTH IS MORE PREVALENT OF ONE CAMPUS. MAYBE IT'S- ARE MAYBE ANOTHER ISSUES OR PROBLEMS ON ANOTHER CAMPUS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVING MORE LINE ITEMS WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO TRACK SOME OF THESE INITIATIVES WILL MORE CAREFULLY. AND SOME OF THESE INITIATIVES ARE ARE A BIT DIFFERENT- FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH FOR EXAMPLE WELL THE UNIVERSITY IS SPECIFICALLY HIRING MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AT EACH CAMPUS. HAS SPECIFIC GOALS IN PLACE TO REACH CERTAIN STAFFING LEVELS REDUCE WAIT TIMES THE LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO REVIEW LEVEL MORE CAREFULLY DAHLE IMPLICA FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OVER TRYING TO GET MORE GET MORE DATA AND INFORMATION. LIKEWISE ADDRESSING THINGS LIKE STUDENT SECURITY OR WHICHEVER ARE GOING TO BE A SEPARATE SET OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT WOULD BE. THE ADVANTAGE OF- SEPARATELY I THINK OUR MESSAGE THE ON THE- NON- ON GO FUNDING JUST BECAUSE- THESE ISSUES ARE SOMEWHAT THERE. FOR EXAMPLE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS COULD POTENTIALLY BE MORE OF A ONE TIME ISSUE THERE COULD BE SOME ONGOING ISSUES TOO BUT THOSE THOSE WOULD BE UP. EARLY DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND- STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE THAT COULDBE SOMETHING A LEGISLATURE OF WANTED TACKLE SEPARATELY. YEAH I CONCUR WITH THAT FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT IT'S ODD TO LUMP IN MENTAL HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. HI I'M SURE THAT STUDENTS AND HAVE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS AS- AS WELL AS ONGOING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WE SEE THAT OVER AND OVER. I THINK HAVING ONGOING SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT WE WE'VEWE'VE TRIED TO DO WHICH WE TOOK A LACK AT TOOK A LOOK AT PROP SIXTY THREE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH REMAIN TO DO AGAIN TO TRY TO GET MORE. MONEY FOR HIGHER ED MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. BUT YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT WITH TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW THIS YEAR WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE FLUSH WITH. WITH THAT ONE TIME MONEY. BASED UPON YOU KNOW THE CASH RECEIPTS COMING IN AND WITH AND WITH THE BUDGET- PLUS WE HAVE THIS NEW ONE TIME MONEY THAT JUST IS ABOUT TO BE APPROVED THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO. YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD. PLOW MORE THIS DIRECTLY TO MENTAL HEALTH AND USE ONE TIME FOR TECHNOLOGY NEEDS- I THINK THAT'S A GOOD RECOMMENDATION- QUESTIONS ON THIS IS ON THIS ISSUE NUMBER TWO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BY THAT S. SO UC REGENTS APPROVED A PLAN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN THAT PROPOSED AN INCREASE STUDENT SERVICE FEE S. S. S. BY 5% ANNUALLY FOR FIVE YEARS WITH HALF OF THE INCREASEINTENDED TO SUPPORT STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AFTER TWO YEARS OF THE FSF FEE INCREASES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YOU SEE REQUESTED STATE FUNDING FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PLAN I'M GOING STATE FUNDING HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THREE TO FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS INITIALLY PROVIDED IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WHICH ROUGHLY EQUATES TO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN. THE THREE IN THE THIRD YEAR FUNDING UNDER THE ACCESS FEE INCREASE PLAN SO WHY DIDN'T YOU SEE CONTINUE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REGION'S PLAN TO INCREASE STUDENT FEES AS A SOURCE OF ONGOING SUPPORT FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SELECTED NOT TO INCREASE STUDENT FEES- BECAUSE OF. A CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR STUDENTS THAT THEY FOUND. INCREASE FEES TO BE A BURDEN- AND ALSO CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR OF WHERE WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEMS TO NOT SEE MANDATORY FEES INCREASE FOR STUDENTS. AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- ARE YOU OPEN TO CONSIDERING THE USE OF PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDING TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS. YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET COMMITS ALL AVAILABLE PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDS TO OTHER PRIORITIES. AND I WOULD NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDS HAVE BEEN USED IN THE PAST FOR ONE TIME SUPPORT FOR YOU SEE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS- HOW WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT AS YOU MENTIONED INCLUDES FIVE POINT THREE MILLION NGOING GENERAL FUND FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND THAT ARE OR PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR FIFTEEN MILLION A NEW ONGOING GENERAL FUND WOULD PROVIDE YOU SEE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY OF THE FIFTEEN MILLION WE'RE PROPOSING UC HAS INDICATED THEY WILL. PUT ELEVEN MILLION TOWARDS STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND LEAVE THE OF FOREST REMAINING MILLION TOWARDS THE TECHNOLOGY. HE SAID WE THINK THAT STATE PARK. THAT'S IN LINE WITH THE PROPOSAL AND THAT WOULD. SUBSTANTIALLY ADDRESS STREET MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OFF IN ISSUE NUMBER THREE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU AND I WILL INTRODUCE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COMPONENT AND THEN I WILL HAND IT OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE RANDY CATS FOR THE CAT OUTLAY SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS. THERE'S ALSO A PIECE FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY IN WHICH ALL NOW SWITCH MY COLLEAGUE RANDY CAPPS. HELLO A RANDY KATZ WITH THE OF FINANCE. THE- THERE YOU SEE A SUBMITTED TWO REQUESTS FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY- ONE AN INFORMATIONAL PROPOSAL EXPLAINING THE ARE YOU SEE- YOU THAT WAS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND THEN ANOTHER ONE FOR SEISMIC IMPROVEMENTS AT UC BERKELEY- WE'VE BEEN HAVING- ALSO AS NOTED IN THE AGE GENDER THERE'S BEEN SOME ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS WITH S. B. H. FUNNY AND WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH YOU SEE WE EXPECT TO HAVE THE PRELIMINARY APPROVAL. LETTER OUT SHORTLY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT. I'M WE WILL GO NEXT- SO THIS ISSUE HAS TWO DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND THEN IT AS CAPITAL OUTLAY SO I'LL TOUCH ON EACH ISSUE FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- YOUR FIRST TESTIFYING ON ISSUES LIKE THIS PREVIOUSLY AS WE NOTED THAT WE THINK DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A GOOD USE OF ONE TIME FUNDING WE THINK THE PROPOSED AMOUNT IS JUSTIFIED GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF- BACKLOG PROJECTS THAT YOU SEE HAS THIS ISN'T. AN AREA YOU COULD CONSIDER REDIRECTING AN ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDING TOWARD DEPENDING ON YOUR OTHER BUDGET PRIORITIES YOU GET TO THE INVENTION. WE DIRECT ONE MODIFICATION TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS THE THING THOSE THIS YEAR. THE LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET BILL WHICH WOULD SPECIFY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE. ALL THE PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED WITH THE FUNDS AFTER THE FUNDS ARE RELEASED WE'RE RECOMMENDING MODIFICATIONS SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE GETS NOTIFICATION OF THESE PROJECTS BEFORE THE FUNDS ARE RELEASED THAT WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THEIR PROPOSALS TO PROJECTS IT'S ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PROCESS TO BUILD STATE TOOK A PREVIOUS YEARS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. HI CAPITAL OUTLAY- AS THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THERE'S TWO PROPOSALS HERE ONE IS AFTER BERKELEY AND THE OTHER IS FORMER SAID. AND AT THE MERCED PROJECT. HAD BEEN- THEY USUALLY HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO PURSUE THE MERCED PROJECT IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT- BUDGET. BUT IT ONLY RECENTLY SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE UPDATED INFORMATION REGARDING ITS SCOPE AND COST. WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BERKELEY PROJECT WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE MERCED PROJECT PARTICULARLY AROUND ITS SCOPE COST AND FUNDING PLAN. I'D BE HAPPY TO OPERATE MORE ON THAT DURING THE Q. NAY. THE SECOND TIME. FINALLY OUR ANALYSIS ON CAPITAL OUTLAY ISSUES IDENTIFIED SOME RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE ON THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS AT THE STATE USES FOR UC AND CSU OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE INTENDED TO ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY AND ALSO ENHANCE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND HERE AGAIN AND I'M HAPPY TO ELABORATE ON ANY OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS DURING THE CUNY THAT'S OF INTEREST TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU YOU SEE. SO CALIBER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED INVESTMENT OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION BURKE MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY PROJECTS WILL ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY. PRESS CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND INCREASED LOCAL EMPLOYMENT. EVERY UC CAMPUS WILL RECEIVE A PORTION OF THESE FUNDS. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S IDENTIFIED PROJECTS THROUGH OUR INTEGRATED CAPITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OR I. THEIR HIGH PRIORITY TO CAMPUSES OR THE PROVIDES ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE ESTIMATE THAT THESE PROJECTS CAN BE INITIATED WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND THUS PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED LOCAL EMPLOYMENT THERE ARE CAMPUSES. WHERE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE CAN CONCUR THERE'S A GREAT NEED FOR. A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- ARE YOU SEE CAMPUS ARE AGING PLUS WE HAVE A VERY OLD CAMPUSES LIKE UC BERKELEY WHERE THE SEISMIC NEEDS ARE JUST. TREMENDOUS IN THE IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS VERY STAGGERING SO. YOU KNOW WE COULD USE. THE ENTIRE STATE SURPLUS THIS YEAR AND. AND- AND TACKLE THIS- THE UC. DIFFER MAINTENANCE BACK SO THIS IS THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF WE WILL YOU KNOW TAKE A LOOK AT POTENTIALLY OTHER RESOURCES WHEN WE GET THEM THE FINAL BUDGET AND AS WELL AS FEDERAL MONEY- SO. SINGLE COMMENT WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN- ISSUE FOR OTHER PROPOSALS AS KIND OF A CATCH ALL OF THEM. MISCELLANEOUS PROPOSALS FOR THE UC FROM THE GOVERNOR'S. TWENTY ONE BUDGET. BERMAN FINANCE. THANK YOU CHAIR SO THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WERE CHEN DICED UNDER THIS ISSUE. THESE INCLUDE TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR YOU SEE CRIME. ONE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR A LEARNING LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ALIGNMENT FOR THE UC TO ALIGN WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR SCIENCE AND INNOVATION. FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ARE FOCUSED ON ONLINE EDUCATION. AND THEN LASTLY ONE POINT THREE MILLION ONE TIME JUST OR TO HEALTH MODELING CONSORTIUM BETWEEN THE UC IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU AND WERE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. OKAY. THAT THANK YOU L. A. L. SO IT MIGHT BE HANDY TO TURN TO PAGE SEVENTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA IT SUMMARIZES WHAT IT IS USED IN THE BULLETS. OF THE FIVE ISSUES WE AT WILL RAISE CONCERNS OF THREE ON I'LL GO THROUGH EACH- PROPOSAL WE HAVE CONCERTS. THE FIRST IS ON THAT TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR PRIME- THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED A COMMENDABLE- ISSUE FOR CONSIDERATION THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WHICH IS ADDRESSING LONG STANDING OUTSIDE EQUITIES ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE SOME. CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL. OUR FIRST CONCERN IS AROUND THE FACT THAT THE PROPOSAL LACKS A FEW WANT ESSENTIAL LONG TERM PLANS THAT WE THINK ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE INTENDED GOALS OF THAT PROPOSAL. FOR EXAMPLE- THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE UNIVERSITY HAVE NOT- DEVELOP A LONG TERM PLAN TO ADDRESS HEALTH EQUITY ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE WITHOUT THIS LONG TERM PLAN IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHERE THE REMAINING GAPS ARE WHICH TYPES OF THE GAPS ARE NOT COVERED BY PRINT PROGRAMS. IN WHICH WOULD REMAIN UNADDRESSED UNDER THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL. TWO SECONDS- THE PROPOSED BUDGET APPROACH TO SUPPORT ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN THAT PROPOSAL. HAS INTERVIEW SEVERAL WEAKNESSES JUST A SITE ONE NOTABLE EXAMPLE- THE UNIVERSITY'S ASKING FOR FUNDING UP FRONT FOR GROWTH THAT WILL NOT BE MATERIALIZED FOR. SEVERAL YEARS WE THINK THIS IS NOT ONLY INEFFICIENT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES FUNDING IN YEARS WHERE THE COST HAVEN'T NECESSARILY OCCURRED IT ALSO WEAKENS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT GROWTH. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE WE HAVE. CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED BUDGET APPROACH WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED PERSON FUNDING RATE. THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T HAVE AN ENROLLMENT TARGET SO THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD YOU SEE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS GROSS. AND THEN THERE'S A THE PROPOSAL ALSO WOULDN'T HAVE ANY REPORTING ON OUTCOMES THE PROGRAMS A LEGISLATURE REVENUE CONSISTENT WAY TO EVALUATE ON PROGRAMS IN FUTURE YEARS. AND THEN ARE THIRD CONCERNED WITH THE UC PRIME PROPOSAL IS THAT A SIZABLE PORTION OF THE FUNDS- ARE NOT FOR A MOMENT GROWTH BUT ARE INTENDED TO BOLSTER. SUPPORT FOR EXISTING ENROLLMENT AT EXISTING PROGRAMS. I'M THIS COULD POTENTIALLY BE JUSTIFIED FOR EXAMPLE PORTION OF THE FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT FINANCIAL AID- BUT IN OUR VIEW YOU SEE HAS NOT JUSTIFIED THE BULK OF THIS ENHANCEMENT FUNDING. AND EVEN FOR FINANCIAL AID WORK AT THE EVENTUALLY BE WARRANTED. YOU SEE HAS NOT PROVIDED ENOUGH INFORMATION TO ESTIMATE STUDENTS FINANCIAL NEED TO REALLY ASSESS WHETHER. I WAS FUNDING JUSTIFIED. SO IS THE CASE WE THINK THE LARGEST COULD THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE UNIVERSITY TO COME BACK WITH A STRONGER PROPOSAL THAT ADDRESSES EACH ONE OF OUR CONCERNS. SECOND PROPOSAL I'D LIKE TO. DISCUSS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S TWO FOR SCIENCE AND INNOVATION. MINISTRATIONS PROPOSING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND HERE. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE PROPOSAL APPEARS TO HAVE A VERY NARROW OR IT WOULD HAVE A VERY NARROW IMPACT IT WOULD SUPPORT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY INDIVIDUALS ANNUALLY OR ABOUT. TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD IN A NARROW SET OF INDUSTRIES. THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CONNECTED TO A STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT OF WORKFORCE NEEDS AND SO IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES AND INDUSTRIES UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. ALL REFLECT THE STATE'S HIGHEST WORKFORCE NEEDS. HERE AGAIN IS A SITUATION WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A BETTER PROPOSAL THAT REFLECTS OUR CONCERNS. WERE ALTERNATIVELY IT COULD REJECTED THIS PROPOSAL REDIRECT THE FUNDING FOR OTHER- HIGH PRIORITIES THINGS LIKE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE FINAL OF. PROPOSAL I WANT TO DISCUSS IS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. SO HERE AGAIN OF THE RESTORATION HAS IDENTIFIED SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF THE FIELD WHICH IS THAT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT HAS. BEEN A HIGH PRIORITY PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF KOBE IN THE MOVE TO REMOTE INSTRUCTION. THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THE UNIVERSITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE NOT PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE A NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF FACULTY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND SO THE NUMBER OF FACULTY IN NEED OF DEVELOPMENT THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NEEDED. AND THE TYPES OF- FUNDING AVAILABLE TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR THESE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT KNOWN TO THE LEGISLATURE. IN ADDITION THE UNIVERSITY IS RECEIVING A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF FEDERALLY FUNDS AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF ACTIVITY. THAT FEDERAL FUNDS COULD BE USED TO SUPPORT. SO HERE WE ARE OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO REJECTED THIS PROPOSAL NOW YOU MIGHT RECALL THAT IN ISSUE ONE WE RECOMMENDED- REPORT ON UC'S EXPERIENCE OF ONLINE EDUCATION. AND OUR PORT WE ENVISIONED TO INCLUDE- INFORMATION ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT INSERTED THE NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. IT WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE MORE DATA SO THAT I CAN MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS IN THIS AREA NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. I WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANYTHING IN TUNING. THANK YOU UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SAVER CAN IMPROVE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO INVEST IN YOU SEE STUDENTS AND RESEARCH WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THESE ITEMS WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROPOSAL TODAY I WILL MAKE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS AND MEDICAL EDUCATION ALSO KNOWN AS PRIME. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION IN NEW INVESTMENTS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION BACK WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS AND THE STATE. CRIME TRAINS MEDICAL STUDENTS TO PRACTICE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THE FOCUS ON HEALTH EQUITY AT THE CENTRAL ELEMENT IN ALL CRIME PROGRAMS. THE SPECIAL TRAINING THESE GRADUATES RECEIVE PREPARES THEM FOR LEADERSHIP ROLES AS COMMUTING HUGE CLINICIANS EDUCATORS RESEARCHERS AND SOCIAL POLICY ADVOCATES FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THE MAJORITY OF HOMES ARE. FROM GROUPS UNDERREPRESENTED IN MEDICINE INCLUDING AFRICAN AMERICAN BLACK NEXT AN AMERICAN INDIAN POPULATIONS. THE AVAILABILITY OF MEDICAL CARE FOR CALIFORNIANS COMMUNITIES IS LIKELY TO BECOME MORE CHALLENGE IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE ONE THIRD OF THE STATE'S POSITIONS ARE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY. THESE DOCTORS ARE ABOUT TO START RETIRING AND THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED. FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY PRIME STUDENTS HAVE GRADUATED MEDICAL SCHOOL SINCE PRIME STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR. THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNOR WOULD ALLOW YOU SEE TOOK SPENT TIME WITH YOUR NEW PROGRAMS. WANT TO SERVE AMERICAN INDIAN AND NATIVE ALASKAN COMMUNITIES AND THE OTHER TO SERVE BLACK COMMUNITIES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT EXISTING PROGRAMS WOULD ENABLE YOU SEE MEDICAL SCHOOLS TO ASSURE STABLE ONGOING FUNDING FOR PRIME. IN ADDITION TO FUNDING A PORTION OF THE COST OF INSTRUCTION THE PROPOSED NEW FUNDING WILL ENABLE YOU SEE MEDICAL SCHOOLS TO MEET 1100% OF THE DEMONSTRATE FINANCIAL NEED FOR EACH TIME STUDENT. ORIGINALLY PLANNED ENROLLMENT LEVELS REDIRECT RESOURCES TO EXPAND PIPELINE PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN OUTREACH AND RECRUITMENT OCTOBER STUDENTS. SECURE ADDITIONAL TRAINING SITES AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE THE SUPPORT NEEDED FOR LEARNING RESOURCES EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID. AND IMPROVE DATA COLLECTION TRACKING AND ANALYSIS. ONE THIRD OF THE FUNDING PROPOSED WOULD. GO ONE STUDENT FINANCIAL AID KERN PLACE 4% OF STILL TAKE A STUDENT DEBT WHILE IT BROUGHT ANY USE MEDICAL SCHOOL. THE AVERAGE DEBT FIRST UPON. FROM MATTER SCHOOL IS A HUNDRED AND THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH NOT INCLUDE POSSIBLE BACK FROM UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES. THIS LEVEL OF DEPTH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS TO WORK IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ON GRADUATION. THE PROPOSED FUNDING WOULD HELP TREMENDOUSLY. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT SOON WE WILL PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THE PROCESS OF MEDICAL ONE MOMENT IN PROGRAMMING. SPECIFICALLY IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE L. A. L. WITH MEDICAL SCHOOL AND RESIDENCY TAKES A MINIMUM OF SEVEN YEARS TO TRAIN NEW DOCTORS READY TO PRACTICE WITHOUT SUPERVISION. CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER FOR ACTION I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT PRIME. FOR THE REMAINING PROPOSALS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR GO THROUGH THEM ONE AT A TIME THAT WOULD BE PREFERABLE. I THINK WE'RE OKAY- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR MEDINA. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK YOU SEE FOUR- COMMENTS ON PRIME. I REPRESENT AN AREA OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS CERTAINLY UNDERSERVED- IN THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS AND I THINK THIS PANDEMIC. HAS ONLY HIGHLIGHTED THE INEQUALITIES AND IN THE MEDICAL CARE THAT EXIST WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WE THE RATIO AND I WISH I REMEMBERED WHAT THAT RATIO AS THE RATIO OF. OF THE POPULATION TO THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS IN MY AREA LIKE IN MUCH OF A INLAND CALIFORNIA. IS SO MUCH LOWER THAN THE COASTAL AREAS- SO THEREFORE. THE NEED FOR- DOCTORS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS AND I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE- PRIMES THAT IS A SET TO BE EXPANDED PROGRAMS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHICH I THINK IS A PROGRAM BETWEEN. UC MERCED- AND FRESNO STATE IS THAT IS THAT. ARE YOU SEE MERCED UC SAN FRANCISCO. YOU SEE MERCED AND- UCSF FRESNO BRANCH CAMPUS RIGHT. NO THEY THEY SHARE WITH MYERS OF THIS- YOU KNOW I'M NEED FOR- MORE DOCTORS AND THEN AS THE UCR'S SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WAS ESTABLISHED TO SPECIALLY SERVE- THE UNDER REPRESENTED. A POPULATION UNDERSERVED EVEN MORE BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES OF- OF CULTURE AND LANGUAGE I KNOW THAT IT'S PROBABLY NOT ON HERE BUT THE UC IRVINE HAS A SPECIAL PRIME PROGRAM TO TRAIN A DOCTORS WHO ARE FLUENT IN SPANISH. SO I HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH SOME OF THE PRIME STUDENTS FROM UC SAN FRANCISCO. AND JUST AS I AM SO IMPRESSED WITH THE UC- OUR STUDENTS ARE ENTERING THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND AS THEY GRADUATE AND THE DIVERSITY. OF THE UCR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE STUDENTS GRADUATE I WAS JUST AS IMPRESSED WITH THE STUDENTS THAT I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH- THIS WEEK FROM THE UC SAN FRANCISCO PRIME PROGRAM. AND THE DIVERSITY THAT THAT THE STUDENTS REFLECT MUCH NEEDED IN IN THE- AND THE KINDS OF DOCTORS THAT WE PRODUCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE KINDS OF DOCTORS. THAT ARE CULTURALLY COMPETENT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A DIVERSE POPULATION SO I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT PRIME. I THINK THE TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IS CERTAINLY- MONEY WELL SPENT- TO THE CONCERNS OF THE L. A. O. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE MECHANISMS THAT WE COULD GET MORE INFORMATION. ON HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS AND GET THAT KIND OF REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY. I THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE EASY TO DO. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD ME THIS MORNING. TALK A LOT ABOUT UC RIVERSIDE. MAYBE ONE QUESTION. HOW CAN YOU SEE RIVERSIDE GET AT A PRIME PROGRAM. YEAH AND- AND I DO NOT ASK THAT- SARCASTICALLY OR- I'M SERIOUS IN THE- WHAT WHAT. WHAT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO MEDICAL SCHOOL ENROLLMENT IS- HIGHLY CONTROLLED BY D. ACCREDITING ENTITY AND THUS ARENA- UC RIVERSIDE DOES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GROW AND WE ARE LOOKING AT- A CONVERSATION BETWEEN ALL THE MEDICAL SCHOOL DEANS THE C. WHERE TO TWO NEW PROGRAMS WOULD BE PLACED- THE DECISION HASN'T YET BEEN MADE ITS- WAY DEPENDENT ON RESOURCES AND GETTING THAT APPROVAL FROM THE ACCREDITING ENTITY- BUT TO ANSWER YOUR FIRST POINT REGARDING REPORTS WERE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. ON A REPORT ON FRIDAY OUTCOMES THAT WOULD- SHOW YOU HOW EFFECTIVE THESE PROGRAMS ARE. AND THE PRIME STUDENTS DO NOT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ADDITIONAL STUDENTS RIGHT OR- IT ISN'T- NAY A SUBSET OF THE- NUMBER. STUDENTS ALREADY ENROLLED IN PROGRAMS. HEARD SHOTS OF FRIENDS. YEAH UC RIVERSIDE HAS BIRDS IS GOING TO APPROACH A HUNDRED STUDENTS- WITH ONE OF OUR PRIME PROGRAM SAY AT THAT PLACE THANK YOU SEE ARE MEAN ADDITIONAL MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE A SUBSET OF SAY THE ONE HUNDRED MEDICAL STUDENTS THAT ARE ALREADY THERE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IT COULD BE EITHER SO WE COULD TAKE A SUBSET OF THE EXISTING- ENROLLMENT AND MAKE THEM PRIME PROGRAM STUDENTS. WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO WORK WITH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OR WE COULD INCREASE THE TOTAL SCHOOL ENROLLMENT TO INCORPORATE TIME. IN THE PAST I'M PROGRAMS HAVE INCREASED INVOLVEMENT IN MEDICAL SCHOOL SO WE USE THAT AS A WAY TO. INCREASE ENROLLMENT WHAT WE COULD DO EITHER. AND DID YOU MENTION WE WERE GOING TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE PRIME STUDENTS- TODAY. I'M NOT. YOU YOU MIGHT DURING PUBLIC COMMENT I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANY- WITH ME THAT WE WALKED UP THE SOCIAL SPEAKERS THANK YOU. YES SEE YOUR STRONG ADVOCACY THERE FOR YOUR- PRIME ALLOCATE I WOULD NOTE WE HAVE A BUDGET PROCESS YOU CAN ALWAYS IN YOUR BUDGET LETTER THAT CHAIRED. SUBMIT THIS AS YOUR MEMBER REQUEST AND FIND YOUR OWN PRIME PROGRAM THERE YES YOU ARE MAYBE GET- THIS REYES SAID MISTER ROTH TO HELP YOU OUT TOO SO. GIVE ME SOME TIPS THERE MR MEDINA- I WILL NOTE THAT THIS THE PRIME- PROGRAM AND THESE EFFORTS IS EXTREMELY POPULAR WITH. A LEGISLATORS ESPECIALLY FROM RURAL AREAS- DOCTOR WOULD DOCTOR RAMBLE- AND YOU MISTER MEDINA AMONG OTHERS THAT HAVE CONTINUALLY MENTIONED. THIS MISTER SALAS AND IN BAKERSFIELD AS WELL SO- IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WELL VERSED ON AND- YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT THE IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR PRIVATE PROGRAMS AND SAYS THAT THAT REALLY AT THAT THE HEALTH ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIA BUT YOU SEE AS OUR- TEACHING HOSPITAL IN THE IN THE- UNIVERSITY BUDGETS AS PART OF OUR- WORK FOR THIS SUBCOMMITTEE- SO MY MEMBER BY A DENTIST. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN SO HOW DID THE ADMINISTRATION DETERMINE THE NEED FOR TWO NEW PRIME PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE PROPOSED FOCUS ON AMERICAN INDIAN NATIVE ALASKAN AND BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATIONS- EIGHT I'M JUST INTERESTING WHAT I'M INTERESTED TO KNOWING WILL- HOW THAT IS EVALUATED AND DETERMINED. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO THIS WAS THIS THIS PROPOSAL IS. HAS THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTEREST VERY INTERTWINED WITH THE UC'S ENTRANTS THE HISTORY OF THIS PROPOSALS THAT FIRST IT WAS A REGENT REQUEST SO THE REGENTS WERE COMING FORWARD WITH A TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND REQUEST. FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT. THE ADMINISTRATION THEN IN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SPECIFICALLY PROPOSED A NEW NATIVE AMERICAN FOCUSED PRIME. PROGRAM WITH BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ALSO. UP SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED UC TO OUR A SECOND NEW PRIME PROGRAM BUT DID NOT SPECIFY WHAT THAT SECOND NEW PROGRAM WOULD FOCUS ON. SENSE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETS RELEASED UC'S INDICATED NOW THAT THEIR THEIR DECISION WOULD BE TO USE THAT TO FOCUS ON AFRICAN AMERICAN. POPULATIONS SO THAT'S HOW WE GET TO NOW THIS TWELVE POINT NINE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A TO DO PROGRAMS ONE FOR NATIVE AMERICAN WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION CAME FORWARD WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND TOO IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS THE UC HAS A PROPOSED THIS SECOND AFRICAN AMERICAN. FOCUSED PROPOSAL. AND WHEN DO YOU THINK IT MISTER WILL ANTICIPATE IDENTIFYING WHICH YOU SEE MEDICAL SCHOOLS WILL OPERATE THE PROPOSED PRIME PROGRAMS. THANK YOU FOR THE FOLLOW UP IS THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WE PROPOSE DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY CITE ANY METHOD FOR DEFINING THAT WE'RE LEAVING OUT FLEXIBLE FOR YOU SEEK TO DECIDE- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS- AND HAVE NOT COME TO A CONCLUSION IN TERMS OF. WHERE THE REGIONAL BASIS FOR THE CAMPUS WOULD BE- WOODLAND- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE REASON FOR THE FLEXIBILITY IS THAT YOU SEE AS THE- THE ORIGINATORS OF THE MINISTRY THERE'S ON THESE PROGRAMS- THEY'RE THEY'RE BETTER POSITIONED TO KNOW WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE BEST LINKAGE WITH THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITY. AND YOU SEE DO YOU HAVE ANY INDICATION OF WHEN- AND HOW YOU'LL MAKE THE SELECTION OF WHICH- WHICH MEDICAL SCHOOLS- LAUNCH THESE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- IN TERMS OF HOW WE WILL MAKE THE DECISION OF THE DIFFERENT MEDICAL SCHOOL DEANS WILL DISCUSS THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES THERE NEEDS TO BE ENOUGH FACULTY- ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS AND FACULTY WHO- HAVE. PRACTICED IN IN SERVING THOSE COMMUNITIES PREVIOUSLY AND HAVE THE LINKS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO HAVE THE PRIME PROGRAMS WITH- THERE NEEDS TO BE ENOUGH AVAILABILITY OF CLINICAL ROTATIONS NEAR THE SCHOOLS. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE AVAILABILITY OF ALL THOSE FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE MOST OPTIMAL SITES AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE THAT DECISION- BY THE END OF JUNE. THANK YOU IF YOU COULD FOLLOW UP AND GIVE US MORE INFORMATION ON THIS AS IT COMES THROUGH I'D APPRECIATE THAT- ALSO FOR YOU SEE A PRIME PROGRAMS- YOUR PRIME PROGRAMS CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR ONLY ABOUT 10% OF YOU SEE MEDICAL STUDENT ENROLLMENT- AND YOU ALSO ALLOCATE FIVE TIME THE STATE GENERAL FUND FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDENTS- COMPARED TO HOW MUCH ALLOCATE FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. COULD OR- DOES DOES. WHY DOES USED WHAT HEY WHY DOESN'T YOU SEE HAVE MORE THAN 10% OF THEIR MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDENTS AND PRIME AND IS THERE PLANS TO INCREASE THAT. ARE MEDICAL SCHOOL DEANS WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO INCREASE OUR PROGRAMS NOT JUST LIMITED TO THE TWO NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING NOW BUT THERE ARE OTHER- PROGRAMS AS WELL THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO. INCREASE AND INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE CRIME PROGRAMS FUNDING HAS BEEN A LIMITATION AS HAS BEEN- THE ABILITY TO. PROVE ENOUGH BASE FUNDING FOR DISCREDITING. AGENCY THAT ACCREDITS MEDICAL SCHOOLS WHAT TO LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF GROWTH ALSO GROWTH IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED BY THE NUMBER OF CLINICS. AND ABILITY TO DO CLINICAL ROTATIONS NEAR MEDICAL SCHOOL. BECAUSE OF THOSE FACTORS- WE HAVEN'T GROWN FIND AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE TO WERE VERY OPEN TO A DISCUSSION ON HOW TO INCREASE THE- NUMBER OF. CRIMES STUDENTS AND PRIME TRAINING WITHIN OUR MEDICAL SCHOOLS ARE TO EITHER ADD ADDITIONAL COURSES FOR EXISTING MEDICAL STUDENTS OR TO INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SEATS IN OUR MEDICAL SCHOOLS. FOR CRIME PROGRAMS. AND THE ANNUAL FUNDING OF ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THE SAN JOAQUIN PRIME PROGRAM HAS YET TO ACHIEVE THE FUNDED ON THE TARGET. OF FORTY EIGHT STUDENTS WITH ONLY THIRTY SIX STUDENTS ENROLLED AS OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ACADEMIC YEAR. RATHER THAN PROVIDING THE FULL AMOUNT OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING UP FRONT WOULD IT BE REASONABLE TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ONLY FOR ANY NEW PROGRAMS OVER OVER MULTIPLE YEARS TO ACCOMMODATE A MORE REALISTIC. AND GROW ENROLLMENT GROWTH TIME FRAME. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. BECAUSE MEDICAL SCHOOL SCHOOL CLASSES INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER WHERE THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE PROGRAM LONGER. WORK AS HELPERS ARE. ART EDUCATORS FOR THE OF NEW INCOMING COURSE CLASSES YOU'RE CREDITING. OUR AGENCY DOES REQUIRE THE MEDICAL SCHOOL'S PROOF. THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING BEFORE ADMITTING ANY STUDENTS OR FOR ALL. INCOMING COHORTS- THAT MEANS THAT WE CAN'T RATE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO EACH INCOMING. COHORT LIKE WE DO WITH UNDERGRADUATE FRESHMEN FOR EXAMPLE BUT RATHER WE HAVE TO HAVE THE YEARS ONE THROUGH OR FULLY FUNDED BEFORE WE CAN AND MAKE BUCK FORCE FIRST CLASS- AND THAT DOES COMPLICATE THE AMOUNT. OF AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR- CRIME PROGRAMS AND MEDICAL SCHOOLS WHERE IT'S VERY. RESOURCE INTENSIVE. THANK YOU YES. THREE IF YOU COULD. OUR EXPAND A LITTLE BIT FOR US HOW THE PRIME PROGRAM DIFFERS FROM THE REGULAR- MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRICULUM IF THAT IS THE RIGHT WORD AND THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT PRIME STUDENTS- TAKE THAT HAVE- ACCESSIBILITY TO AND THE DIFFERENT PRIME PROGRAMS THROUGH OUT THE UC SYSTEM AND THE DIFFERENT AGREES THAT SOME OF THE PRIME STUDENTS CAN ATTAIN IN THE PROGRAM. BESIDES THE MEDICAL DEGREE IF YOU. HAVE THOSE DETAILS. I THINK I THINK THEY WERE IN A- GOOD FOR- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS ARE I HAVE SOME OF THOSE DETAILS- SURPRISED STUDENTS CAN FREQUENTLY TAKE A- MASTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALONG WITH THEIR MEDICAL STUDIES- THEY ALSO HAVE CLINICAL ROTATIONS IN THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'RE STUDYING TO PRACTICE WITH- SO THAT THEY GET HANDS ON EXPERIENCE WITH WORKING WITH THE POPULATION PROVIDING CARE IN TERMS OF THE PRIME PROGRAMS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. WE HAVE A RURAL CRIME WORKS WITH WORLD POPULATIONS WE HAVE A LOT TO KNOW COMMUNITY PRIME WE HAVE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FOCUSED RIDE THE TRAINS DOCTOR SPECIFICALLY FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- WE HAVEN'T FOR URBAN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY WHERE STUDENTS LEARN HOW TO WORK WITH URBAN A LOW INCOME POPULATIONS INCLUDING THE HOMELESS POPULATIONS THAT HAVE EXTREMELY LIMITED ACCESS. THE AMERICAN INDIAN THE NATIVE ALASKAN PRIME AND THE- BLACK AFRICAN AMERICANS. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO COMMEND THE COUNTER FOR THE- PROPOSING THE TWO NEW PROGRAMS FOR NATIVE AMERICANS- CARE AND AFRICAN AMERICAN AMERICANS I THINK BOTH ARE MUCH NEEDED. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU WE'RE ALL THIS UP IN OUR NEXT ISSUE IS NOT A BUDGET ITEM PER SE IN THE BUDGET BUT- THIS SUBCOMMITTEE IS WELL MISTER MEDINA I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FINANCIALLY REFORM. IN THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WE WANT TO GIVE YOU SEE A CHANCE TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THESE CAL GRANT REFORM PROPOSALS- ESPECIALLY RELATED TO INSTITUTIONAL AID. AND WITH THAT WE HAVE I THINK SEAN BRICK WITH THE UC OPS THE PRESIDENT. THE CORRECT. YES THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. HI MY NAME IS SEAN BURKE AND I AM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR STUDENT FINANCIAL SUPPORT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS I'VE SERVED ON STATEWIDE WORK GROUPS THAT HAVE. CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA'S NAY COMMISSION'S. RECOMMENDATIONS ON CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GARCIA AND HER STAFF HAVE BEEN VERY TRANSPARENT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. OF DEVELOPING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND I WANTED TO THANK HER FOR HER LEADERSHIP. THE PROPOSED STRUCTURE IN THE SEE SACRAMENTO'S ALL VASTLY SIMPLIFIES THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. MAKING IT SIMPLE FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS TO UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE GONNA CAL GRANT TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR CAL GRANT FOUR FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION. EVERY YEAR THE AWARD IS THE SAME MAN LIKE THE CURRENT CAL GRANT BE PROGRAM. ANY ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM TRACKS WITH THE BIGGEST EDERAL FINANCIALLY PROGRAM THE PROGRAM. AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL THE CAL GRANT FOR WOULD SEND A VERY POWERFUL MESSAGE. FROM THE STATE TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS. IF YOU QUALIFY FOR POKER FOR A CAL GRANT. YOU WON'T NEED TO PAY TUITION AT UC. WE ARE VERY WELL THE TUITION IS JUST PART OF THE AFFORDABILITY PICTURE BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS WORRY FIRST ABOUT TUITION. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OUR OWN INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID STRATEGY EXPLICITLY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE OTHER COSTS THAT STUDENTS FACE. SUCH AS BASIC NEEDS LIKE HOUSING AND FOOD AS WELL AS BOOKS AND SUPPLIES TRANSPORTATION AND HEALTH CARE. OUR GOAL IS TO TAKE COST OFF THE TABLE FOR STUDENTS AS THEY MAKE THEIR COLLEGE CHOICE AND THEN SUPPORT THEM UNTIL THEY GRADUATE. IF WE TRY TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH FINANCIALLY IT'S THE ONLY NEED TO WORK PART TIME CONTRASTING THEM TO ATTEND SCHOOL FULL TIME. AND TAKE OUT A MODEST AMOUNT OF STUDENT LOANS IN ORDER TO COVER ALL OF THOSE OCCASIONAL COSTS. WE USE OUR INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIALLY PROGRAM TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BY FILLING IN GAPS. LEFT AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PARENTS WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PAY. WE USE OUR INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM TO COVER TUITION. FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO DO NOT GET A RECEIVER CAL GRANT CURRENTLY. SO FOR EXAMPLE THOSE WHO EXCEED THE CURRENT AGE THRESHOLD. CAL GRANT PROGRAMS OR MAYBE REQUIRE FIFTH YEAR TO GRADUATE. IN TOTAL BETWEEN THE COVERAGE PROVIDED BY CAL GRANTS IN YOU SEE GRASS ABOUT 56% OF OUR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. NO TUITION. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT PROGRAMMING COVERING TUITION AND FEES- MANY UC STUDENTS THAT MOST OF OUR OWN FINANCIAL AID GOES TO COVER BASIC NEEDS ANOTHER EDUCATIONAL COSTS. ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF UC'S NEED BASED GRANTS AND ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE. GOING TO PAY FOR THESE COSTS BEYOND TUITION. THE CALDERON MODERNIZATION PROPOSAL PUT FORTH BY SEATAC STRAIGHTEN THIS PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE. AND THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IMPROVE THE AFFORDABILITY OF YOU SEE DEGREE IN OUR STUDENTS AS A WHOLE. WE THINK THAT UNDER THE CURRENT PROPOSAL YOU SEE STUDENTS WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. SOME YOU SEE STUDENTS WITH MORE OF A MIDDLE INCOME BACKGROUNDS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE CURRENTLY QUALIFY WOULD NOT QUALIFY IN THE FUTURE. BUT SLIGHTLY MORE UC STUDENTS WITH A MORE LOW INCOME BACKGROUND OR CURRENTLY SHUT OUT OF THE PROGRAM DUE TO AGE OR LENGTH OF TIME OF SCHOOL WHAT QUALIFY. THEREFORE BECAUSE YOU SEE BACK FILLS WITH ITS OWN YOU SEE NEED BASED GRANT. THOSE LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO DON'T CURRENTLY GET A CAL GRANT. COUNTERPROPOSAL WOULD FREE UP SOME OF THAT YOU SEE NEED BASED GRANT THAT COULD THAT INSTEAD GO TOWARDS THE BASIC NEEDS OF OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS. IN OTHER WORDS YOU SEE STUDENTS AS A WHOLE WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER OFF AS A RESULT OF CAL GRANT PRIORITIZATION. ON THE MARGINS WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS- DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM THOSE MORE MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS THAT I MENTIONED. WHO WOULD NO LONGER QUALIFY UNDER THE REFORM PROPOSAL MAY FACE CHALLENGES. AS IT IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED YOU SEEN. IS UNABLE TO HELP MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENTS. YANG WHAT THEY'RE GETTING FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. THEIR OWN YOU SEE GRANT DOLLARS. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE BILL CLASS SCHOLARSHIP IS A LAST DOLLAR PROGRAM AND SO EVERY DOLLAR. IN INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID WE PROVIDE TO MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENTS REDUCES A DOLLAR OF THEIR MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM BUT WE THINK THAT SOME REFORMS AND HOW. AND THEN FINALLY LINKING THE STATE'S FINANCIALLY PROGRAM TO A FEDERAL PROGRAM TO THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT DOES MEAN BACKED POLICY CALLS WILL NEED TO BE MADE WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGES THEIR PROGRAM. I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CSX STAFF ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TO ASSESS WITH THE CHANGES THAT HAPPENED. IN THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. OVER THE HOLIDAYS. ALL IN ALL THOUGH AS HE SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE THAT OUR CORE PRIORITIES. IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY FIRST UC STUDENTS AND SIMPLE AND THE PROGRAMS. ARE PART OF THE REFORM PROPOSAL. AND AGAIN I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I THANK YOU MR BREAK AT I WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU- SO I OUR GOAL IS TO ONE SIMPLIFY IT. AND EXPAND ELIGIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO JUST JUST MISSED OUT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP THAT'S A- THAT'S SOMETHING HASN'T BEEN DETERMINED YET. THAT'S A VERY POPULAR PROGRAM WITH THE LEGISLATURE SOME STRONG OPINIONS ON THAT WE HEARD A FEW WEEKS AGO. IN OUR COMMITTEE ON THE CALGARY FORM IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THERE'S SO FEW IN OUR STATE BUDGET TO HELP MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AND RIGHTFULLY SO OUR BUDGET PROGRAMS HELP. THAT YOU KNOW THOSE THAT WITH EXTREME NEED. IT AS LIVING IN POVERTY- IT BUT YOU KNOW MIDDLE CLASS MATES AND GET LEFT BEHIND SO WE HAVE DECIDED WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH THAT- POTENTIALLY- YOU KNOW TAPER DOWN FOR THE HIGHEST EARNERS IN THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. BUT STILL HAVE SOME OF THAT- A THIRD ROUGHLY THE THIRD TUITION PAID. I WANTED TO GO BACK TO YOU TO THE INSTITUTIONAL AID AND- SO HOW. IS THEIR CONCERN FROM THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HOW WOULD THAT PLAY. WITH THE- THE READ THE IS WHAT'S CALLED THE BLUE AND GOLD RIGHT. HOW DO YOU ARE THERE IN SAY WHEN. YOU'RE BLUE AND GOLD PROGRAM AND YOUR THE THIRD OF THE TUITION GOES BACK TO FINANCIAL AID. SURE WE DON'T HAVE- CONCERNS WITH HOW IT WOULD INTERACT WITH THEIR INSTITUTIONAL A PROGRAM WHICH IS ALREADY. FLEXIBLE ENOUGH THAT IF DIFFERENT GROUPS OF STUDENTS- QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO MOVE OUR INSTITUTIONAL AID MONEY TO HELP THOSE LOW INCOME STUDENTS WITH THE NONTRADITIONAL COSTS AND THEN ALSO- POTENTIALLY COVER TUITION FOR OTHER STUDENTS SO IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT RIGHT NOW WE KIND OF HAVE IT DE FACTO SYSTEM IN PLACE WITH. USE WITH UC COVERING. NON TUITION COSTS FOR YOUR CAL GRANT SLASH PELL STUDENTS WITH THE BLUE AND GOLD. YES WE ARE OUR OWN INSTITUTIONAL A PROGRAM WE'RE PROVIDING BETWEEN IT DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT BY ART TWENTY SIX AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS- FOR SOME OF THOSE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS TO OFFSET THOSE. NON TUITION COSTS. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE. OKAY DESPITE US NOT SAYING THAT OKAY THANK YOU THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN- CONVERSING WITH THE UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS ALL SEGMENTS ON THIS ANYWAY SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. OKAY THANK YOU WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO PLOW THROUGH NOW. THE- C. S. U. SOME CSU BUDGET.

WE THINK IT DOES HELP SURE THAT ABOUT WHICH CAMPUS ACTRESSES IF I COULDN'T MOVE OKAY OUR SYSTEMATIC. THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO IT. THANK YOU SEE IF YOU. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS ON BEHALF OF THIS YEAR ISSUE FOR DELVING INTO EACH OF THE ISSUES ON OUR AGENDA TODAY. YOUR MCCARTY HI MY NAME IS RYAN STORM I AM THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET FOR THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE JOINING TODAY DOCTOR LOW ON THE ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR STUDENT AFFAIRS AND ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT. MISS BY SAN JUAN SYSTEM VICE CHANCELLOR FOR CAPITAL PLANNING DESIGN CONSTRUCTION. AND MR NATHAN EVANS CHIEF OF STAFF AND SENIOR ADVISER FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS. THE FOUR OF US WILL PROVIDE YOU THE DETAILS WORK FROM SPECIES PERSPECTIVES AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. NOW THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS A FEW NEW MEMBERS AND TO GET TO KNOW THE FUTURE WILL BE BETTER. I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME VERY HIGH LEVEL INFORMATION ABOUT SEATS YOU. SO THE NATION'S LARGEST FOUR YEAR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY TO SEE ISSUE PROVIDES EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES 284-008-6000 STUDENTS. ON TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. NOW STRETCHING FROM HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE NORTH TO SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY IN SOUTH CSU ANNUALLY ANNUALLY CAN FOR SOME ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DEGREES. AND BOASTS NEARLY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION LIVING ALUMNI. NEARLY HALF OF ALL A BACHELOR'S DEGREES WERE THE CITY IN CALIFORNIA R. C. ISSUE DEGREES. AND ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIA WORKERS IS A CSU GRADUATE AND IN FACT ONE IN TWENTY AMERICANS HOLDING A COLLEGE DEGREE IS A GRADUATE OF THE SEATS YOU. NOW TO MY OVERALL COMMENTS ABOUT THE BUDGET. GOVERNOR NUISANCE FUNDING PROPOSAL FOR THE CSU RECOGNIZES THE POWERFUL ROLE OUR CAMPUS IS PLAYED IN THE STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THIS ISSUE STANDS READY TO DO EVEN MORE AND REQUEST THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE SUPPORT ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING THAT WHICH RESTORE PRIOR CUTS CREATE JOBS THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND ENSURE WE CONTINUE TO REDUCE EQUITY GAPS AND PREPARE STUDENTS FOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE WORKFORCE. THIS YEAR SHE WAS EXPERIENCE A BUDGET IS EXPERIENCING BUDGET CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF A TWO HUNDRED NINETY NINE BILLION DOLLAR ONGOING STATE FUNDING REDUCTION. WE ARE ONE OF THE VERY VERY FEW STATE PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVED AN ONGOING CONFLICT THAT'S- THAT'S NOT ALL. OUR SO FUNDED STUDENT ENTERPRISE PROGRAMS NOT CELERY SUCH AS STUDENT HOUSING PARKING AND DINING AT REVENUE LOSSES AND COSTS THAT EXCEED SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SINCE THE START OF A PANDEMIC. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S RECESSED SINCE WITH SOME OF THOSE LOSSES AND COSTS. AS A BEACON OF SOCIAL MOBILITY AND JOB CREATORS THERE ARE THREE AREAS WHERE WE ARE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. FIRST RESTORATION OF THOSE CUTS TO MAINTAIN JOBS. THIS ISSUE HAS LARGELY BEEN ABLE TO AVOID SYSTEM WIDE LAYOFFS AND FURLOUGHS OF ITS FIFTY THREE THOUSAND FACULTY STAFF. PRUDENT FISCAL MANAGEMENT AND USE OF RESERVES WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THIS LONGSTRETH OUT THAT RESTORATION IN THE STATE BUDGET THE SUMMER. SECOND I GRADUATION SHIP TWENTY TWENTY FIVE OR EVEN MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE. ISSUE HAS IMPROVED ITS FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE BY 63% SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. THAT'S A NIGHT I REQUEST THIRTY POINT 19% GROWING 231% THIS IS SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT IN AN UNPARALLELED RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT OUR WORK IS UNFINISHED AS WE MUST ELIMINATE THE GAPS. IN THIRD ECONOMIC FACILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE TO CREATE JOBS NOW SEE SHE HASN'T IDENTIFIED SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS KNACK AND FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. INCLUDING FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION AND APPROVED PROJECTS THAT CAN IMMEDIATELY PROCEED TO DESIGN ERROR CONSTRUCTION TO HELP STIMULATE THE ECONOMY. WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED ALREADY ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN ONE SENTENCE FOR THIS. SO NOW IN CONCLUSION HERE'S THE SUMMARY ISSUES USE POSITION ON THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROPOSALS SO ON THE BUDGET RESTORATION LAST MONTH THE SPEAKER OF THE PRO TEM. THE GOVERNOR COMMITTED TO FULLY RESTORE THAT. IN THE C. SHE WAS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT COMMITMENT AND CLEARLY SUPPORTS IT. AT RESTORATION HAS NOT YET BEEN CODIFIED AND WE ENCOURAGE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO FOLLOW THROUGH. AND INCLUDE THAT FULL RESTORATION IN THE FINAL BUDGET ACT THIS SUMMER. ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S BASED PROPOSAL SEIZE YOUR SUPPORTS THE ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION OF ONGOING DOLLARS PROPERTY COST INCREASES AS- AS MENTIONED EARLIER BY THE ADMINISTRATION. IN ALL THE CSU UP OR TRUSTEES REMAINING REQUEST I HAVE TWO NUMBERS FOR YOU TO REMEMBER SIXTY SIX MILLION IN ONGOING FUNDS AND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING. THIS ISSUE SIX ADDITIONAL SIXTY SIX MILLION OF ONGOING FUNDING ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL. IF YOU WERE. TO GRANT OUR REQUEST IT WOULD FULLY COVER COSTS WE CANNOT AVOID SUCH AS RISING HEALTH CARE PREMIUM INCREASES. WHAT ALSO FULLY FIVE GRADUATION SHIP TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THAT REQUEST WHICH WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE RESILIENCY OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND STUDENTS FUTURES. FURTHER THIS ISSUE SIX ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION AND ONE TIME DOLLARS TO FUND ACADEMIC FACILITIES AND RURAL NEEDS THAT TOO IS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL. SO THOSE ARE THE C. ISSUES OVERALL COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET MY COLLEAGUE MISTER NATHAN EVANS HAS ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO SHARE. THANK YOU MISTER STORM AND THANK YOU- CHARM MCCARTY I'LL BE VERY BRIEF- ONCE AGAIN NATHAN EVANS CHIEF OF STAFF AND SENIOR ADVISER. FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS IN THE CSU OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR- I THINK I WOULD JUST ADD TO WHAT RYAN SHARE THAT- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT DESPITE THE PANDEMIC- LAST MAY UP NEARLY A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND A RECORD NUMBER. CSU STUDENTS EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND JOINED THE RANKS OF OUR MORE THAN THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION ALUMNI. AND WHILE COLLECTIVELY UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE NATION- SOL UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT DROPPED. BY APPROXIMATELY 4% TO SEE ISSUES ENROLLMENT ACTUALLY GREW TO A RECORD HIGH. OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND PERHAPS MOST NOTABLY CONTRIBUTING TO THAT WAS OUR HIGHEST RETENTION RATE EVER. FOR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS HAVE 85% FOR THEIR FIRST TO SECOND YEAR OUR RETENTION. AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A TESTAMENT NOT ONLY TO OUR STUDENTS RESOLVE BUT ALSO TO THEIR TRUST IN THE CSU ON DAY AND THEIR FAMILIES. TO ENSURE THEIR PROGRESS TOWARD- HIGH QUALITY DEGREE. AND I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT THIS IS OCCURRING BECAUSE OF OUR AT THE C. ISSUES ON WAVERING COMMITMENT TO OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THAT MR STORM SPOKE ABOUT. REALLY FOCUSED ON THREE KEY OBJECTIVES IMPROVING GRADUATES HAVE GRADUATION RATES FOR ALL STUDENTS ELIMINATING EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY KICK GAPS IN DEGREE COMPLETION. AND METER MEETING CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WORKFORCE NEEDS- BUT AS YOU'VE HEARD OUR WORK ISN'T FINISHED EVEN WITH ALL THIS PROGRESS- IN DOING OUR PARK FOR A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL WE MUST ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS IN THOSE OUTCOMES BY RACE BY INCOME. AND BY FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE ATTENDANCE. AND WITH THE SOCIAL UNREST IN OUR ECONOMIC UPHEAVAL UPHEAVAL THAT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES HAVING CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MORE IMPORTANT RETURN ON INVESTMENT SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME TODAY MY COLLEAGUES AND I- AND MR TRUMP WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE- OVERVIEW- PHILLIMORE VITAS DID YOU DO IT YEP YOU HAVE A CSU IN YOUR DISTRICT IN. RIGHT OUTSIDE WHICH WHICH ONE CAN'T. CASTING NORTHRIDGE OKAY SELF- DO YOU LIKE TO START HERE GO AHEAD I JUST HAVE A SIMILAR QUESTION IS WHAT I ASKED THAT THE UC SEGMENT- AROUND THE SPECIFICS FOR EQUITY GOALS WHAT DOES THE ADMINISTRATION- X. BACK WHAT WHAT ARE THEY EXPECTING THE PLANS TO REFLECT AN ACHIEVED. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- SO WE HAVE BEEN AS WE WERE DESCRIBING WE ARE MIDWAY THROUGH OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- PROCESS AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT. EACH CAMPUS AND OUR SYSTEM THAT- STRETCH GOALS FOR THEIR OVERALL GRADUATION RATES FOR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS AT IT FOUR YEAR AND SIX YEAR MARKING FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS AT A TWO YEAR AND FOUR YEAR MARK AND EMBEDDED IN THOSE GOALS WAS THE ABSOLUTE ELIMINATION. OF EQUITY GAPS BY RACE ETHNICITY BY HEALTH STATUS AND BY FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE ATTENDANCE STATUS. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CAMPUSES THAT ARE ALREADY ZEROED OUT THOSE GOALS THAT YOU MARK MAY HAVE HEARD FROM CHANCER CASTRO WHEN HE SPOKE TO THIS COMMITTEE- BUT WE HAVE OTHER CAMPUSES THAT STILL HAVE WORK TO DO AND SO. FIRST AND FOREMOST IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION SHARING ACROSS OUR CAMPUSES I'VE HEARD CHANCER CASTRO NOTE THAT FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE THREE C. ISSUES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- ONE OF THOSE CAMPUSES ARE STANISLAUS HAS EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED THEIR EQUITY GAP FOR PELL STUDENTS. SO AGAIN SHARING THOSE EXPERIENCES AND THOSE STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN USED ACROSS OUR CAMPUSES SO THAT'S ONE ELEMENT IS REALLY BENEFITING FROM THE LEARNED AND LIVED EXPERIENCES. OF OUR CSU CAMPUSES AND THEIR LEADERS AND STUDENTS TODAY THE SECOND ACTUALLY JUST ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO WE DELIVERED TO EVERY CSU PRESIDENT- THROUGH AN EQUITY REPORT- LOOKING AT THEIR TRAJECTORY TO THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOAL OF ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS. AND AROUND THAT WERE THREE SORT OF STRATEGIC AREAS OF FOCUS THAT WE ENCOURAGE EACH CAMPUS TO REALLY BUILD AND MORE DETAILED PLAN AROUND- FIRST WAS ON STUDENTS THAT HAD ALREADY LEFT THE CSU AND HOW TO RE ENGAGE THOSE STUDENTS- IF THEY BEGAN AND LET'S SAY PAUL NINETEEN OR FULL TWENTY. THAT PERHAPSOF ALREADY LEFT UNIVERSITY STRATEGIES TO RE ENGAGE THOSE STUDENTS THE SECOND WORST DIDN'T THAT MAY. BE AT RISK OF LEAVING THE UNIVERSITY YES BASED THEIR YEAR PER- OR THE- OF COURSES THEY'VE TAKEN. AND THEN THERE WAS A THIRD STRATEGY LOOKING AT SPECIFICALLY- AREAS AND MAJORS AND DISCIPLINES IN WHICH THEY ARE MAYBE HIGHER NON PASS RATES WITH SOME STRATEGIES AROUND THAT SO FROM THAT OUR WORK IS REALLY DATA INFORMED AND THAT'S BEEN THE FODDER FOR THEIR CONVERSATIONS THAT EACH CAMPUS WILL BE- GOING BACK TO THOSE ORIGINAL PLANS THAT THEY DEVELOPED. BUILDING ON THEM BASED ON THE PROGRESS THEY'VE MADE ALREADY. GREAT THANK YOU. NO FOR THE CURRENT QUESTIONS CHECK OKAY. THANK YOU- I WANTED TO ENGAGE ON THE ENROLLMENT ISSUES AND THAT THE REDIRECTION. SO OBVIOUSLY THIS IS INTERESTING TIMES THROUGH THE PANDEMIC- I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN PROPERLY ESTIMATE WHERE WE'RE AT AS FAR AS DEMAND APPLICATIONS BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH COVER NINETEEN BUT WE DID SEE WITH OUR LAST PANEL HUGE INCREASE OF PERSEUS FOR YOU SEE AN APPLICATIONS. ARE ARE WE SEEING ROUGHLY THE SAME INCREASE FOR THE CSU FOR APPLICATIONS. THEY HAD ABOUT A LAW HARNESSES ARE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR STUDENT AFFAIRS AND ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT SO I'LL I'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE THAT QUESTION SO WE CONTINUE TO TRACK OUR- APPLICATIONS VERY CAREFULLY AS YOU WELL KNOW WE DID HAVE ANOTHER RECORD SETTING SEMESTER THIS PAST FALL IN TERMS OF OVERALL ENROLLMENT. BASED ON THE LATEST SNAPSHOT THAT WE HAVE TAKEN AND WE JUST HAD OUR LAST CAMPUS CLOSE ARE OUT THE OFFICIAL APPLICATION ARE DEADLINE- AT THE END OF FEBRUARY AND SO IN LOOKING AT THAT WE ARE NOW ROUGHLY AT ABOUT THREE PERCENT. BOB LAST FEWER APPLICATIONS THAN COMPARED TO LAST YEAR AND WHAT YOU'RE A SO THIS YEAH WHAT DO YOU WHAT WHAT I'M SORRY INTERRUPT YOU- YOU ARE DONE YET BUT THAT WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT TO EAT EAT EAT YOU SEE FOR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN THE SAME ROUGHLY POOL OF. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES YOU NOT QUITE BUT COLLEGE READY- PERFORMED WELL ACADEMICALLY IN HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU SEE OR GETTING A 16% INCREASE IN CSU. ADDRESS IS IT THE- THE FINANCIAL MEANS FOR THE STUDENTS BACK HOME IN THEIR FAMILIES MANY THE SAME DEMOGRAPHICS FOR THE ARE FOR THE UC SELL IT CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH. HOW DO YOU TO BE THE DIFFERENCE. YEAH AND I THINK THERE MULTIPLE RE I THINK THE AN X. QUESTION. I WOULD ACTUALLY OFF FRIENDLY SUGGESTS THAT IN MANY WAYS OUR CSU STUDENTS ARE MUCH MORE SIMILAR TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ENROLLMENTS IN TERMS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATUS AND FAMILY SITUATIONS SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE IMPACT ON COLLEGE. ACCESS AN ASPIRATION IN MANY WAYS HAS MIRRORED THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY RIGHT IT'S A K. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT FAMILIES THAT HAVE MORE ECONOMIC MEANS. WE'RE SEEING LESS VARIANCE IN THEIR DESIRE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND THEN FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE MORE FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED OUR PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THAT'S CARRYING OUT- DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WE IMAGINE POST PANDEMIC. WILL HAVE A DECREASED DEMAND BECAUSE THEY ARE NEEDING TO MEET OTHER LIFE LIFE PRIORITIES AT THIS TIME SO WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S ONE FACTOR THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE STILL QUITE PLEASED THAT WE HAD EXPECTED THAT THE DROP IN APPLICATIONS WILL BE HIGHER- TRACKING WITH. OTHER NATIONAL- UP FOR OUR PROJECTIONS AND- TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING NATIONWIDE FOR OUR INSTITUTIONAL TYPES SO OUR FOCUS IS THAT WE STILL ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING ACCESS. APPLICATIONS ARE ONLY ONE NUMBER AND SO IT'S STILL IMPORTANT THAT WE ADMIT OUR STUDENTS ARE EVERY SINGLE ONE THAT IS A QUALIFIED AND ELIGIBLE FOR CSU ADMISSION. AND HELP GET THEM ENROLLED AND COME TO COLLEGE SO THAT OUR COLLEGE ATTAINMENT WILL BE A PART OF THEIR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. THE LAST FACTOR I WOULD ADDRESSES THAT ON SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD WE HAVE AN IMPENDING ENROLLMENT CLASS. THAT IS COMING SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE APPLICATION NUMBERS THEY ACTUALLY VARY FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS SO SOME CAMPUSES STILL% SAW AN INCREASE SO OFTEN THAT IS IN A DROP. YOU'RE. GONNA SEE IT WE'RE GONNA SEE A DROP YES I AM ONLY CLIPPER FOR TO THE PRINT. DRAW OVERALL IN THE NO OF NEW. HIGH SCHOOL GRAD- THAT WILL BE COMING OUT CALIFORNIA ALONE BY TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN WHICH IS WHEN THE PROJECTIONS GO OUT TO- IS PROJECTED TO EXPERIENCE A 16% DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES SO FOR SOME PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SEE THE IMPACT OF THAT- AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE ALREADY STARTED THEIR DECLINE AS WELL SO I THINK THAT IS ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR. WE CERTAINLY HAVE MANY OTHER STUDENTS AND ADULTS THAT WE CONSERVE BUT THAT IS ONE PIECE TO LOOK AT. I'M ON THAT ISSUE- IT AT THAT IN IT WHAT THE ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IS. WAIT WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS WHO ARE. ALL IS READY AND MORE STUDENTS WHO I THINK ARE REALIZING THAT THE TICKET TO A GOOD PAYING JOB IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IS MORE THAN HIGH SCHOOL SEE EVEN NOW WE WE'RE GONNA HAVE FEWER. THE NUMBER OF PERTH IF YOU WERE AT NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT MORE OF THOSE EXISTING GRADUATES. CSU ELIGIBLE IN REDDING AND SO THE IT WOULDN'T HAVE AS MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON THE DROP IN. APPLICATIONS ARE YOU STILL ANTICIPATE. THE DROP. SO THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND THIS REFLECTS THE VERY COMPLICATED NATURE RIGHT OF PROJECTING IMPACTS ON APPLICATIONS I THINK ALL HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES THERE IS INDICATION THAT A GREATER PROPORTION OF THEM ARE MORE COLLEGE READY BUT THEN HOW THAT INTERFACES WITH THE TOTAL NUMBER AND I WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT COMPETITION THEN FOR ALL STUDENTS RIGHT GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO INCREASE IN INTENSITY SO OTHER STATES FOR EXAMPLE THAT ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE A DEEPER DROP MAYBE LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA CRITICALLY THOSE CAMPUSES ARE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LOOKING TO INCREASE THEIR ETHNIC OR RACIAL DIVERSITY WILL OFTEN COME TO CALIFORNIA. RIGHT TO INCREASE- AND ADDRESS THOSE GOALS SO I HAVE TO SAY THAT WITHOUT OUR ACTUAL DATA GOING FORWARD GOING TO HAVE TO MONITOR THIS I WOULD BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT PROJECTING WHAT WILL BE THE NET IMPACT BUT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE TO ONE THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE STUDENTS WE SERVE OUR FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE TRYING TO RAISE ATTENTION ABOUT THIS STUDENTS WHO HAVE ARE OLDER ADULTS AND WHO HAVE SOME COLLEGE BUT HAVE NOT COMPLETED THEIR FOUR YEAR DEGREE SO WE WANT TO INTENTIONALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE SERVE A GREATER PROPORTION OF THOSE STUDENTS AS AN EXAMPLE SO ACTIONS LIKE THAT COULD HELP OFFSET. WHATEVER IN RALEIGH CLIP FOR EXPERIENCING FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. OKAY. AND THEN- MAYBE RYAN CAN YOU- OR OR OR OR YOU AS WELL HERE I'M SORRY FOR CATCHING THE AND GET YOUR NAME AGAIN. LATELY THE ONE COULD GET SOMEBODY FROM THE C. S. YOU TALK ABOUT THE REDIRECTION POLICY. AND HOW THAT'S GOING SO FAR AND- IF WE NEEDED DURING THE TO DOING TO ADD TO ADJUSTED OCCUR KEEP THAT GUN. I CAN CERTAINLY ADDRESS THAT MONEY IS LOW LOW LOW. OKAY EVERYONE FINE ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW SO- WE AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE- NOW ABOUT TWO YEARS UNDER OUR BELT AND I BELIEVE THERE IS A SUMMARY OF THE REDIRECTION DATA SO WE THIS IS BEEN A WONDERFUL LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR US SO WITH TWO YEARS UNDER OUR BELTS- I THINK YOU WILL SEE IN THE AGENDA THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAVEN'T HAD NECESSARILY- THE YIELD RATE THAT WE WOULD LIKE BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTICE WE HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED STUDENTS WHO THEN WERE OFFERED ADMISSION TO A CSU THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN OFFER THAT SO IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. R. FOR ACCEPTING THEY ARE A NOTABLE NUMBER OF STUDENTS I THINK WHAT WE LEARNED IN THIS IS THAT BOB THERE ARE A SMALL NUMBER OF CAMPUSES THAT PROVIDE THE SIGNIFICANT AN ALMOST OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO END UP BEING PRETTY DIRECT IT AND THE REALITY OF IT IS THAT ULTIMATELY STUDENTS ARE APPLYING TO A CAMPUS RIGHT THE CAMPUS HAS THE BRAND THE CAMPUS HAS THE IDENTITY THAT THE CAMPUS HAS THE DISTINCTIVE PERSONALITY ARE ATTRIBUTES ARE CLIMATE THAT THE STUDENT IS SEEKING AND THAT IS WHERE THEY ASPIRE TO GO AND STILL OFFERING REDIRECTION FOR SOME STUDENTS IF THAT WAS NOT AS SIGNIFICANT AN ASPECT OF THEIR COLLEGE CHOICE- THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED IN BEING ABLE TO JUST GET THE COLLEGE DEGREE. BUT WE'RE SEEING THAT FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR STUDENTS TO REDIRECT THE pSIMPLY BEING REFUSE BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T THEM MATCH WHAT THEIR COLLEGE ASPIRATIONS LIES SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES WE DO BELIEVE THAT IN THE FORTHCOMING YEARS WHERE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WILL BE CHALLENGING FOR MANY OF OUR FAMILIES AS THEY FACE RECOVERY IN THE POST PANDEMIC ERA THAT THERE WILL BE SOME PRESSURE- TO GO TO CAMPUSES THAT ARE CLOSER TO THEM SO WE'RE GOING. TO WATCH AND CERTAINLY EVALUATE I NEXT YEAR THE NEXT ROUND OR- TO THE THERE WERE AN IN. YES THANK YOU SEMIRAMIDE AT US SO DOES THE CSU HAVE A TO HAVE DATA ON WHETHER RE DIRECTED STUDENTS WHO DO NOT ENROLL IN THE CSU CAMPUS CHOOSE TO ENROLL IN ANOTHER COLLEGE UNIVERSITY AND WHAT AND WHAT A HEARING IN IN IN YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'RE GONNA EVALUATE. OVER THE NEXT YEAR ARE YOU COLLECTING DATA ON THIS. WE DO HAVE SOME DATA SO FOR EXAMPLE IN LOOKING AT ALL STUDENTS WHO ARE STILL WHICH CSU ELIGIBLE AND WHO DON'T END UP. ARE COMING TO ENROLLING AT A CSU PER SE WELL WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THEM DO END UP GOING TO EITHER- I COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR YOU SEE SO THE OTHER SEGMENTS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IRONICALLY- OUR SOME OF OUR OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT. COMPETITORS WERE ALSO MONITORING TO SEE HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE ARE GOING OUT OF STATE- BUT RIGHT NOW THE LARGEST PERCENTAGES IN THOSE AREAS WHAT IS INTERESTING. IS THAT THERE THERE WAS A GROUP OF STUDENTS THAT IT DID NOT APPEAR HAD NECESSARILY GONE TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION. THAT WE COULD SEE WITHIN THAT THAT IMMEDIATE YEAR NOT A LARGE NUMBER- BUT THAT IT'S JUST SOMETHING OF INTEREST TO NOTE BUT FOR SURE OVER 60% WE WOULD SAY ARE GOING TO EITHER C. C. OR TO A UC CAMPUS. THANK YOU. WELL I THINK THIS IS A- AND THE IDEA THAT THAT- HAS BEEN EMBRACE IT IS WORKING AND I'LL GIVE CREDIT TO OUR BUDGET CHAIR TANKER REALLY PUSHED US TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS- A FEW YEARS AGO AND- I THINK IT'S WORKING SO BUT UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT THAT THE OVERALL BUDGET ISSUE WAS TALKING ABOUT BASE FUNDING ARRANGEMENT AND- AS WE KNOW IT AS AS NOTED BY A RAINSTORM- YOU KNOW CSU APPRECIATES THE RESTORATION OF LAST YEAR'S CATS AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THE LARGER PICTURE AND LOOKING AT WHAT'S COMING IN THE MAIL REVISED AS WELL AS- A ONE TIME MONEY. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO- THANK YOU KNOW I WAS GONNA ASK YOU SEE THIS QUESTION AND I FORGOT SALAS YOU BRIAN- ANSWER THIS FROM THE BUDGET PERSPECTIVE WHAT WHAT'S YOUR BASICALLY HOT TAKE ON THE FEDERAL STIMULUS BROWN THREE- IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S GOING TO BE I THINK FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR HIGHER ED. FOR- CAN. SEVEN THAT GOES DIRECTLY FOR STUDENTS OF COURSE FINANCIAL AID IS IMPORTANT BUT- SUFFER COMMITTEE CALLS BUT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT A BILLION. I BELIEVE KLIENT ROUGHLY FOR UCCS HIMSELF MISTER STORM YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON WHAT THE CSU WILL DO WHAT YOUR SHARE ASSUMING THAT THE HOUSE PASSES IT AND GET SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT BUT THAT LOOKS TO BE. THE CASE TODAY. YEAH THE OTHER SIDE THERE SEEMS TO MAJOR PIECES OF THE- THE NEW S. RABBITS. LEGISLATION FIRST. THERE IS AID TO STUDENTS WHICH IS ABOUT 50% OF THAT. AND THEN THERE IS- INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS WERE INSTITUTIONALLY. THAT'S THE OTHER PORTION OF THAT- GRAND TOTAL FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT PERSPECTIVE- WE ANTICIPATE- WE ANTICIPATE. GO AHEAD RANK. OKAY I'M SORRY I LOOK AT MY SCREEN WAS NOT WORKING WELL SO I PAUSED AND HEARD SOME SOME NOISE IN THE BACKGROUND BUT ANYWAY I THE GRAND TOTAL THAT WE ANTICIPATE RESPONSE PRELIMINARY INFORMATION OUT OF SOME OF OUR PARTNERS IN THE FEDERAL ATTACK I READ THAT WE ANTICIPATE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT COULD BE USED IN INSTITUTIONAL AID. TO SUPPORT OUR CAMPUS IS NOW THERE'S A BIG CARRY OUT WITH THAT THIS IS NOT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU CAN ONE SPEND ON ANYTHING YET GENERALLY AREN'T ARE INTELLIGENT SAYS THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE THIS FUNDING A LOT LIKE THAT FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE WHICH WAS TO REIMBURSE REVENUE LOSSES AND CAN COVER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WHAT THE CAN DOWN NEXT. SO THAT THAT WILL HAVE A CERTAIN LIMITATION THE OTHER MAJOR LIMITATION OF COURSE IS THAT. IT'S ONE TIME FUNDING. THAT'S THE MAG. THAT WE BEGINNING ALL IN INTO OF. SYSTEM TO THE UNIVERSE. FROM ALL THREE ROUNDS OF FUNDING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. I'M SORRY NO ONE POINT SIX MILLION ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. I HAD I HAD A COUPLE OF A SUB SUB TOTALS. ONE POINT SIX BILLION TO ASSIST WITH A NUMBER OF. I CHALLENGES THAT ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR ELEMENTS WERE UNIVERSALLY OR FACE YES SO IN PLAIN ENGLISH THAT ONE TIME MONEY WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD YOU DO IT WELL WHAT CAMPUS IS DOING THAT. WELL CERTAINLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR US HAS BEEN A LOSS OF PARKING REVENUE. AND HOUSING HOUSING IS STILL VERY LIMITED ON OUR CAMPUSES. AND SO THAT WOULD REIMBURSE THE IT WAS PROGRAMS STUMBLE ACROSS THIS BELT CAN. SIMPLY BACK FILL FOR COVERED LOSSES RIGHT. RIGHT THE OTHER THING TOO IS THAT WE HAVE LOTS OF COSTS RELATED TO- WE ANNUALLY LIKE EVERY OTHER STATE AGENCY BE TO ROUTE REQUIRE OUR COST IMPLICATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ON A PERIODIC BASIS WERE WELL OVER A HUNDRED MILLION THERE- I AM TELLING AND WE ALSO ARE FORECASTING IN THE FUTURE THAT WILL HAVE A NUMBER OF. POSSIBLE LOSSES AS WE CONTINUE THROUGH THIS- THIS SPRING TERM RIGHT. WE HAVE I HAVE SOME DATA THAT IS ONLY UP AND GET THROUGH. D. JANUARY TIME FRAME SO WE HAVE. ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LOSSES THAT WILL BE EXPERIENCING. A THROUGH THE SPRING TERM. YEAH OKAY. THANK YOU. WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND I WILL NOTE THAT WE ARE NOW IN ISSUE SEVEN SECOND CSU ISSUE BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR RECESS AS WAS DONE EARLIER DURING THE HEARING. WE HAVE- I RESPECTED CAUCUSES AND SO. WE HOPE TO BE BACK IN ABOUT AN HOUR BUT STAY TUNED. THANK YOU. BY ABOUT ONE MINUTE. THE. OKAY WILL BEGIN AS THE- SUB COMMITTEE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE LIKE SAY. BUT WE'RE HERE HERE HERE THE SHOW GOES ON SO LET'S PROCEED NOW WITH ISSUE SEVEN STUDENTS SUPPORT BASIC NEEDS PROPOSALS FROM THE CSU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR- GENERALLY WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS FOUR HUNDRED BUDGET WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ACCESS EQUITY AND BUDGET RESILIENCY AS IT HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN LIGHT OF THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC STUDENTS SUPPORT- AND BASIC NEEDS ARE CRUCIAL TO ACADEMIC SUCCESS TO PROVIDE FURTHER SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES. FIFTEEN MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR STUDENT BASIC NEEDS INVESTMENTS FOCUSING ON STUDENT TECHNOLOGY AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. FIFTEEN MILLION ONGOING TURNER FINE FOR BASIC NEEDS COMPONENT IN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SHIFTS THE SUSPENSION DATE FOR SUCH SUSPENSION DATE FOR SUMMER TERM FINANCIAL IF THEY'RE DRIVING MAINTAINING THE PROGRAM AT SIX MILLION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU L. L. EVERYTHING ABOUT A. L. A. COUNTY. MENTIONED EARLIER WE AT THAT PROPOSAL RIGHT SCHEMES AFTER AND- ANTI ISSUE. THAT HAS HAS THINK ANY. WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S LOCAL BASICALLY. AND HEALTH. THAT. FIRST FINANCES NOTED THERE ARE TWO ON GOING NEEDS FOR SEE. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION BY HOW BEST TO WEAR THIS PROPOSAL AND MINOR JACK. THIS MORNING DISCUSSED THAT WITH YOUR TO THE HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY ONE OF ALLEGE COULD AS DE **** THOSE ADDRESS IN FACT. ANOTHER QUESTION IS HOW THE MIDDLE AND- RELATES TO THEIR PROPERTY BASICALLY. ALL ALSO INJURED IF YOU YOU BUDGET FOR THE PAST ACT. ONE TIME WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED STATE EMERGENCY A. MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE TO EVALUATE THEM IN LINE AS FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS BUT PURPOSE. AS RELATED THAT LIKELY THIRD ROUND OF FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS BACK TO. EIGHT SEEMS IMPORTANT TO THE- TO HAVE TO MAKE FROM THE SAN AND HOW THEY INTEND TO USE SO FEDERAL FUND. SO THAT THE LARGEST CAN ANY STATE FUNDS FOR THAT PURPOSE. TOWARD ANY GAPS IN YOUR NAME. THING WE HAVE TO TAKE CLASS. TO OKAY THANK YOU SEE A FUTURE OFFICE. HELLO OF STILL LOCAL. SO AS WE THIS MAR THE ONE YEAR AND OF THE WE DO SO DEEP APPRECIATE FOR THE STATE AND FEDERAL AID THAT HAS HELPED TO SUPPORT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS BUT IN PARTICULAR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. THE ONSET OF COVERED NINETEEN AND THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISTRESS THAT FOLLOW CREATED UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND FOR STUDENT BASIC NEEDS SUPPORT ON ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES. AND JUST AS INSTRUCTION PIVOTED TO BE PRIMARILY ONLINE OR VIRTUAL SO TO DO OUR STUDENTS SERVICES WHETHER FROM EMISSIONS TO FINANCIAL AID REVISING TWO CREW SERVICES AND FROM STUDENT ACTIVITIES TO STUDENTS SUPPORT. GIVEN THE RACIALLY ETHNICALLY AND FINANCIALLY DIVERSE STUDENTS WE SERVE WE KNEW THAT SUSTAINING CONNECTION AND COMMUNITY WERE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO ROUTE THIS TIME. DURING THE PANDEMIC CHANCELLOR EMERITUS WHITE AND NOW CHANCELLOR CASTRO HAVE KEPT THE UNIVERSITY SITES ON TO NORTH STARS ONE SAFEGUARDING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE ENTIRE CSU COMMUNITY. AND TO ENSURING THAT AS MANY STUDENTS AS POSSIBLE STAY ON TRACK TO EARNING THE PROVEN LIFELONG BENEFITS OF A CSU DEGREE. TODAY I'M PLEASED TO SHARE HIGHLIGHTS OF HOUSE USE YOUR MINISTRY- FACULTY STAFF COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND OUR STUDENTS MARSHALED RESOURCES TO HELP SAFEGUARD THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR COMMUNITIES STATE WIDE. STUDENT BASIC NEEDS IN THE CSU FALLS ACROSS THE BROAD SPECTRUM FROM FOOD INSECURITY AND HUNGER. HOUSING INSECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND FINANCIAL DISTRESS. IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC THE CSU HAS NOW ADDED DIGITAL LEARNING NEEDS TO THAT DEFINITION IN RECOGNITION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT WAS IDENTIFIED. WITHIN THESE AREAS CAN BE FOUND IN EVEN MORE DIVERSE CONTINUUM OF NEEDS SO FOR EXAMPLE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES CAN RANGE FROM HOME SICKNESS AND TEST TAKING ANXIETY. TO SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN RESPONSE CAN RANGE FROM PREVENTATIVE AND SELF CARE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO COUNSELING FOR TRAUMA AND DEPRESSION. OR PSYCHIATRIC MANAGEMENT OF THE DSM FIVE DIAGNOSIS THE MOST OF YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND ILLNESS IT'S- PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF THE ANDEMIC THE CSU HAD IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE WHICH TAKES A HOLISTIC APPROACH. TO STUDENTS WELL BEING BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM. AT ANY OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES STUDENTS WOULD FIND A FOOD PANTRY A FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM EMERGENCY CAMPUS HOUSING OR VOUCHERS FOR OFF CAMPUS HOUSING. CALFRESH APPLICATION ASSISTANCE ACCESS TO EMERGENCY GRANT FUNDS AND DEDICATED STAFF TO CONNECT STUDENTS WITH ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY RESOURCES. WHEN SOCIAL DISTANCING BECAME A DAILY FACT OF LIFE THE CAMPUS IS RELIED ON CREATIVE INNOVATIVE THINKING TO MEET STUDENT NEEDS ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES. FOR FOOD INSECURITY DURING THE PANDEMIC CAMPUSES CONTINUE TO MEET STUDENTS NEEDS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO PHYSICAL FOOD PANTRIES OFFERING CURBSIDE FOOD PICK UP OFFERING GROCERY STORE GIFT CARDS AND IN SOME CASES EVEN DELIVERING FOOD BOXES TO STUDENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO TRAVEL TO CAMPUS. TO SUPPORT CSU STUDENTS WHO ARE LIVING AWAY FROM THEIR HOME CAMPUS WE ENSURE THAT STUDENTS COULD SEEK SUPPORT FROM THE CSU CAMPUS THAT WAS LOCATED CLOSEST TO THEM WHILE THEY STUDIED AND LEARNED FROM HOME. AS OF THE END OF LAST MONTH ONE THIRD OF CAMPUSES HAVE SUPPORTED STUDENTS FROM ANOTHER CSU CAMPUS AND ALL CAMPUSES CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CALFRESH APPLICATION ASSISTANCE CSU HOSTS TO CALFRESH OUTREACH WEEK THE LAST WEEK OF FEBRUARY TO ENCOURAGE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. ELIGIBLE STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND SECURITY THIS IS ALWAYS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE VEIL ABILITY OF SPACE AND OUR NEED TO ADHERE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME THAT A STUDENT TO LIVE ON CAMPUS EMERGENCY HOUSING VARIES FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS FROM TEN DAYS TO THREE MONTHS. MORE THAN HALF OF THE CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE OFF CAMPUS EMERGENCY HOUSING THEREBY INCREASING THE CAPACITY TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS. OF THE SEVEN CAMPUSES ARE CURRENTLY PILOTING COLLEGE FOCUSED RAPID RE HOUSING THIS IS WITH THE SUPPORT OF LEGISLATIVE FUNDING. THESE CAMPUSES ARE WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY AGENCY WITH A HISTORY OF PROVIDING WRAPAROUND SUPPORT TO HOMELESS AND HOUSING INSECURE STUDENTS. ALL CAMPUSES ALSO PROVIDE EMERGENCY GRANTS TO STUDENTS AND THESE FUNDS CAN BE USED TO HELP PAY FOR RENT AND OTHER HOUSING RELATED EXPENSES. WITH REGARD TO MENTAL HEALTH WHEN THE PANDEMIC BEGAN CAMPUSES QUICKLY TRANSITIONED TO OFFERING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES VIA HIP A COMPLIANT VIDEO CALLS. THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT CAMPUSES HAVE CONTINUED TO PROVIDE THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC INCLUDE ONE ON ONE THERAPY SUPPORT GROUPS WORKSHOPS ON SELF CARE REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND CASE MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HOLISTIC NEEDS ARE MET. CLINICAL STAFF ARE ALSO PROVIDED ADVANCED TRAINING AND WORKING WITH STUDENTS OF COLOR INTENDING TO RACIAL TRAUMA. SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE RESOURCES HAVE ALSO BEEN LEVERAGE TO PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH AWARENESS ONE INNOVATIVE EXAMPLE HAS BEEN THE LAUNCH OF AN ONLINE STUDENT WELL BEING PLATFORM ACROSS MORE THAN A DOZEN CSU CAMPUSES. CALLED YOU AT COLLEGE THIS TELEHEALTH SOLUTION FOCUS ON STUDENTS HOLISTIC WELLBEING ACROSS THREE DOMAINS ACADEMIC SUCCESS CAREER PREPAREDNESS SOCIAL COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. THIS RESOURCE EXTENDS THE REACH OF CSU BEYOND CAMPUS SPACE RESOURCES AND EVEN FEATURES A UNIQUE WELLNESS PEER EDUCATOR COMPONENTS TO BUILD A GREATER SENSE F BELONGING AMONG STUDENTS AND THEIR PEERS. LASTLY IN TERMS OF BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THE TRANSITION LAST SPRING TO VIRTUAL LEARNING MEANT THAT CAMPUSES WOULD NEED TO MEET INCREASED DEMAND FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT. BRIDGING THIS DIGITAL EQUITY DIVIDE RESULTED IN CAMPUSES DISTRIBUTING AND THIS IS JUST WHAT WE COULD TRACK SO WE BELIEVE THE TOTAL IS ACTUALLY MORE MORE THAN TWENTY ONE THOUSAND LAPTOPS AND TABLETS AND TEN THOUSAND MOBILE WIFI AND WIFI HOT SPOTS. THE INVESTMENT IN YOU QUIT IT ALONE TOTALED MORE THAN EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES MANY CAMPUSES CONVERTED THEIR PARKING LOTS INTO SAFE SPACES STUDENTS GET ACCESS WIFI FOR FREE. IN ADDITION TO THE SERVICES AGAIN CAMPUS EMERGENCY GRANT AID COULD BE APPLIED FOR AND RECEIVED BY STUDENTS TO HELP COVER SOME OF THESE COSTS OF BIRD MEANING- LEARNING AN ACTIVE ENGAGE STUDENTS SOME CLEANING TO HELP COVER SOME OF THEIR COSTS OF HIGH SPEED INTERNET. I DO JUST WANT TO DRESS UP THE ROLE OF EMERGENCY GRANT AID. LAST SUMMER WELL SPRING AND SUMMER AND THEN A BIT INTO THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY TERM. THIS CSU IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WERE AWARDED AS PART OF THE KERRS ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY. THIS RESULTED ARE BEING ABLE TO ASSIST OVER THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. AVERAGE AWARDS WERE APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS. THIS AID WAS AUGMENTED BY OTHER SOURCES OF OUR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS WHO COULD NOT QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID STORM RESPONSE TO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT RYAN ADDRESSED EARLIER. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE AWARE OF IS THAT THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL. AND GRANT AID- STILL LEAVES OUT SOME STUDENTS IN TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY. AGAIN I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING BASIC NEEDS SUPPORT TO OUR STUDENTS. PROBABLY IN THE AREAS OF FOOD ASSISTANCE EMERGENCY HOUSING AND MORE RECENTLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND RESOURCES TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. WHILE WE BEGIN TO LOOK TOWARDS A FUTURE WHERE WE CAN ONCE AGAIN RETURN TO OUR CAMPUSES AND RECOVER WITH EQUITY WE DO SO KNOWING THAT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A- SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. ON OUR COLLECTIVE MENTAL HEALTH IT WILL BE OUR STUDENTS HOLISTIC WELL BEING THAT MAY BECOME THE NEXT FRONTLINE. EDUCATION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. SPEAKING OF A FRONTLINE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION NOT NECESSARILY FRONT LINE BUT I THINK I TOLD THE CSU THAT THIS PAST MONTH THE PBS NEWSHOUR DONE INCREDIBLE SERIES ON THE IMPACT OF. COLLEGE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND THEY HIGHLIGHTED SOME STUDENTS AT CSU NORTHRIDGE. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT COLLEGE IS A STRESSFUL LOT OF THINGS IT AND CERTAINLY COST SENSE BECAUSE STUDENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED DEPRESSION BUT THIS PANDEMIC IS REALLY. EXASPERATED ENDS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THREE IN FOUR COLLEGE STUDENTS. HAVE SHOWN- THE POOR MENTAL HEALTH- TITUS PANDEMIC SO IT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ISSUE WE NEED TO STEP IT UP EVEN MORE- THIS IS A PRIORITY THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE IN IN IN THE BUDGET. AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO EXPAND RESOURCES FROM PROP SIXTY THREE. THE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IN THE MILLIONAIRE'S TAXES REVENUES ARE INCREASING CALIFORNIA'S THE DEDICATING MORE THAT TO. CALL STUDENTS I THINK IS KEEN NOT TO SEE ISSUE BUT COMMITTEE CALLS AND YOU SEE. ONE THING HERE I THINK I'D MENTIONED THAT. WHICH I TALKED ABOUT THIS DURING THE UC COMMENT SECTION. IS- YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF ODD LINKING MENTAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE BOTH- COMPORT NEEDS WHETHER VERY SEPARATE- AND TECHNOLOGY AS YOU MENTION LAPTOP PURCHASE AND SO FORTH THOSE ARE. A LOT OF TIMES ONE TIME IN MENTAL HEALTH- HIRING PROFESSIONALS TO STAFF TO STAFF- APPOINTMENTS AND SO FORTH WITH STUDENTS YOU KNOW WE NEED PERSONNEL STAFF FOR THAT SO YOU POTENTIALLY WE SHOULD BREAK THOSE TWO UP AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE'LL BE GOOD IDEAS LOOKING AT A ONE TIME MONEY TO DO. A ONE TIME ALLOCATION FACT FOR TECHNOLOGY MAYBE WE CAN BE AGGRESSIVE IN THE AMOUNTS AND SPENT OVER THREE BUDGET YEARS AS WELL- BUT HAVING AN ON. DEDICATING MORE ON GOING FOR MENTAL HEALTH I THINK- IS A PRIORITY. AS FAR AS THE- THE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE. IN ONGOING SUPPORT SO THIS WILL GO OUT TO CAMPUS IS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS BASED UPON THEIR POPULATION AND THEN THEY WILL FOCUS ON WHAT THEIR WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE IF IT'S FOOD OR RAPID RE HOUSING OR SO FORTH IS THAT HOW THAT WORKS. SO WE HAVE AS OF YET- NOT QUITE DETERMINED THE ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY BUT WE ANTICIPATE IT WILL MIRROR OUR PAST APPROACH. SO WE ADOPTED- A SORT OF MINI GRANT PROCESS AN INTERNAL TO THE CSU I REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS WE DEVELOPED IN HIGHLIGHTED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR STUDENTS AND OUR AND OUR ON CAMPUS PERSONNEL WHAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE SOME OF THE PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS AND THEN CAMPUS IS ACCORDINGLY SUBMITTED PROPOSALS. FOR WHAT THEY'RE INTENDED INTERVENTIONS AND STRATEGIES WOULD BE HOW THEY WOULD EVALUATE OUTCOMES AND HOW THEY WOULD BE EXPENDING THE FUNDS AND SO THOSE WERE REVIEWED I THINK WE ERRED ON THE SIDE OF BEING INCLUSIVE. AND GENEROUS RIGHT IN TERMS OF WANTING TO GIVE THE MONEY OUT TWO CAMPUSES I I'VE DISSIPATE THAT WE WILL. PURSUE A SIMILAR APPROACH TO SHARING THE DOLLARS TO THE CAMPUSES OKAY THANK YOU- WELL THIS ISSUE OPEN A FURTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE NUMBER NUMBER SEVEN AS YOU NUMBER EIGHT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE CAPITAL OUTLAY. GENERALLY WHERE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES A ONE TIME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING. TO ENABLE THE CSU TO ADDRESS CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS AS YOU MAY ALREADY BE AWARE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS AT THE CSU ARE SIGNIFICANT AND THESE RESOURCES WILL HELP PROLONG THE LIFESPAN OF THE SYSTEMS CAMPUS BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND ALSO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUES READY CATS RUB REGARDING CAPITAL OUTLAY THANK YOU THANK YOU ALAIA. HELLO THIS IS AND IT'S NOT. I WILL YES WE CAN GO ON TO L. A. L. THANK YOU. ALL THAT. IS THE KING OF THE L. A. M. AS A FAITHFUL TIMES HE'D LEAVE THAT DISTRICT MAINTENANCE IS A PRETTY USEFUL ON AND I WANT REGARDING THAT LITTLE STREET THIS YEAR IS TO MODIFY THE BUDGET LIKELY SAID THAT THE- IS AS TEN DIFFERENT PROJECTS BEFORE RATHER THAN AFTER THE FUNDS ARE DISPENSED. MANY REGARDING CAPITAL THANK BUT CHEN ECONOMIC INDICATOR THAT. I KNOW COVERAGE ON YOUR- APPLE OUT PROPOSALS IN CHEN LISTED ON PAGE THIRTY AND. THIRTY IN GENERAL HE AT SHOULD HAVE MADE CONCERNS THAT THE COP ATHLETE. THAT WE CAN HAVE ONE REGARDING THE- SURE AND. AND THIS PROPOSAL AUTHORIZES YES YOU SPEND I FINING UP TO HUNDRED. IN PROJECTS THROUGH UNIVERSITY FONG. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE MASTER AND- PROJECTS TO SEE A WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC LIST OF THE PROJECT THEY WOULD FIND WHAT BACHELOR MILLION AND- RECOMMENDS LET. ACROSS APPLE'S OF CONTACTS IN ADVANCE. AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED EARLIER THIS MORNING WE DID ALSO RECENTLY SUPPOSED PROVIDER. REALLY TO. CAPITAL OUTLAY REVIEW ESPECIALLY RELATING TO TRANSPARENCY IN THAT ABOUT SCIENCE TODAY SPENT ABOUT SEVEN TO THE STUFF AND BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE WANTED UNTIL HE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SEE IF YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS FIVE SEVEN ONE THE SYSTEM BY CHANCE FOR CAP PLANNING CONSTRUCTION THE C. S. OFF OF THE CHANCE. WE ARE THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT IN TWENTY TO EXPAND THIS ISSUES THAT'S ALREADY TO FINANCE AND FUND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND RENEW OUR PAPER TO RENEW OUR BUILDINGS AND UTILITY SYSTEMS ALSO PREACHED TO SHAPE THE SUPPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE ON OUR PROPOSED TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAM. TO FUND CHECK A FEW CALL REPLACEMENT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS PROPOSED FOR CSU FINANCING WOULD BE ABLE TO GET TO THE LEGISLATURE LIST OF THE PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND PROJECTS AS THE L. A. O. IS MENTIONED A ONCE IT'S MORE CLOSELY DETERMINED ON THE FUNDING FOR IT SUITS YOU DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. WHAT WITH THE AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THIS ISSUE THIS ISSUE IS PRIORITIZE REPLACEMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SEISMIC STRENGTHENING ADDRESSING OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG WITH LIMITED EW FACILITIES TO REPLACE OBSOLETE SCIENCE BUILDINGS AND SERVE JUST ONE MOMENT THAT ARE RELATIVELY NEWER CAMPUS SITES SUCH AS CHANNEL ISLANDS MONTEREY BAY. IN OUR MULTI YOUR PLAN CAMPUSES IDENTIFIED DISABILITIES NEEDS OF OVER SIXTEEN BILLION AND THE PROS PROPOSED ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WILL HELP ADDRESS THE CAMPUS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PRIORITIES AND THE BACKLOG. THE CSU HAS IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THAT COULD BE ADDED TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET TO TOTAL OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION THIS INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PROJECTS THAT COULD IMMEDIATELY PROCEED TO DESIGN. AND OUR CONSTRUCTION TO HELP STIMULATE THE ECONOMY THE ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION WILL HELP THE CSU INSURED OUR CAMPUSES CONTINUE TO OPERATE DURING EXPECTED AND UNEXPECTED POWER SHUTDOWNS AND YOUR AGING FACILITIES TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS AND CAMPUS COMMUNITY. MANY OF THE VENTILATION LIGHTING REPLACEMENTS WILL REDUCE. ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND MAKE FOR THE- ON STATE SINCE YOU SEE WHAT TRUSTEES CARBON. GOALS WE HAD FOR FLEXIBLE IN THE USE OF THE FUN. TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUT ALSO INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY IMPROVEMENTS. THE FLEXIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE WHEN ENABLE US TO INSTALL FIRE SPRINKLERS IN BUILDINGS THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE FIRE SPRINKLERS WELL WE REPLACE OBSOLETE FIRE ALARM PANELS FOR EXAMPLE. IT'S ARE NEEDED AT CAMPUSES SUCH AS CHICO CINEMA AND SAN BERNARDINO. THAT WOULD ENABLE THE CSU TO INTEGRATE SOLAR POWER POWER AND BATTERY STORAGE INTO OUR ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE EVENT THAT FIRE WARNINGS AND HIGH SPEED WINDS. BONTA SHUT DOWN OF OUR ELECTRICAL UTILITY SERVICE TO THE CAMPUS SO WE PUSH IT UP FLEXIBILITY FOR THE USE OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS TO ADDRESS SUCH NEEDS. IT WOULD ADOPT THE CAMPUS TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECURE AVAILABLE UTILITYINCENTIVE FUNDS. WITH REGARD TO TRANSPARENCY THE CSU INCLUDES THAT OUR ANNUAL CAPITAL OUTLAY PLAN A FIVE YEAR HISTORY OF PROJECTS THAT ARE FUNDED BY THE STATE. SO EVEN THOUGH WE MAY PROVIDE TO US FORWARD LOOKING LIST OF HOW WE WOULD USE THE FUNDS WE ALSO REPORTED. ANNUALLY- THROUGH OUR WEBSITE. THE IT IT INCLUDES ALL FUND SOURCE. IN ADDITION TO THE REPORTING THE SYSTEM OFFICE HELPS CAMPUSES BY SETTING UP MASTER CONTRACTSAND AGREEMENTS TO STREAMLINED CAPS CONTRACTING. IN ORDER TO GET PROJECTS GOING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ONE TIME FUNDS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BY FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THE NUMBER OF JOBS. ARCHITECTS AND PROJECT MANAGERS IS ESTIMATED TO INCREASE OVER EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED JOBS. BASED ON THE CONTRACTS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROJECTS SO THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AS AS I MENTIONED DURING THE UC SEGMENT THIS IS THAT HIGH PRIORITY FOR. OUR OUR STATE CERTAINLY PUTS PEOPLE TO WORK TO WITH THE GOOD CONSTRUCTION JOBS AND- AND THAT'S A GOOD USE A ONE TIME MONEY SO THE CSU DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG ISN'T AS LARGE AS THE UC EVEN. EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE TWICE AS MANY CAMPUSES SO THAT RAISES A- GREAT NUMBER OF QUESTIONS GRANTED. SOME OF THE UC CAMPUS ARE MUCH OLDER. THIS ISSUE BUILDING ARE ARE- ARE RELATIVELY NEWER ACROSS CALIFORNIA- BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WILL CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK AT POTENTIALLY PUTTING MORE MONEY IN THERE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH WE HAVE. FROM THAT ONE TIME REVENUE FOR THE NAY REVISE WALLS FEDERAL MONEY- I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- ABOUT THIS. SINGLE QUESTIONS. I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD KNOW THAT- SOMEONE MEMBER TEAM JOIN THIS YEAR AND IF YOU DON'T WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN NUMBER EIGHT- AND- RAIN STORM ARE YOU THERE. YES I AM YES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM WE WILL WANT TO GO BACK TO- ENROLLMENT IN THE REDIRECTION POLICY SO- SOMEONE EVER TAKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO- I'M JUST GOING THROUGH OUR PACKET IN THE LOOK AT THE REDIRECTION I. KNEW THAT THE MINGUS HILLS WAS RECEIVING A NUMBER OF READ DIRECTIONS I DIDN'T REALIZE THE SAN FRANCISCO STATE I GOT UP THERE SO. WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY MY DISTRICTS ARE REALLY HAPPY TO SEE. THAT- ALL. OF TO BOTH THOSE CAMPUSES ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE IN AND ROLLING- RE DIRECTED STUDENTS I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE ON HOW THAT. HOW THAT POLICIES GOING I SEE THAT THERE WAS QUITE A DROP IN TERMS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE OFFERED RE DIRECTION BUT- THE ENVIRONMENT WAS- FAIRLY STEADY BETWEEN. NINETEEN AND TWENTY BUCKS CURIOUS HOW THAT HOW THAT'S GOING. YES SIR THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. SO MAYBE IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING. NOT ALL CAMPUSES RECEIVED REDIRECTED RIGHTS OUR FOCUS REALLY WAS ON CSU CAMPUSES THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY IMPACTED THE IDEA BEING THAT THERE IS AVAILABLE CAPACITY SO OKAY SO I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT. IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS I CAN SEE WHY THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. SO FROM FALL TWENTY NINETEEN TO FALL TWENTY TWENTY OCT IT MORE STUDENTS WERE ALSO BEING ADMITTED RIGHT TO THE ORIGINAL CSU THAT THEY APPLY TO. SO THEN THAT RESULTED IN A SMALLER POOL OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE SEARS YOU ELIGIBLE AND THEREFORE. AVAILABLE FOR REDIRECTION SO THAT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT THAT THE NUMBERS APPEAR TO NOT A LINE. IT'S A GREAT DEAL DO YOU FEEL LIKE- YOU'LL CONTINUE TO GET ABOUT SAY SEVEN TO EIGHT HUNDRED I MEAN APPROXIMATELY. STUDENTS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO RURAL IN. IN- IT IS THROUGH THE ROOF THROUGH BETWEEN DIRECTION. IS THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE FOR THIS COMING YEAR. I WILL BE HONEST AND SAY THAT I AM RELUCTANT TO MAKE A PREDICTION BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST SO MANY THINGS IN PLAY RIGHT NOW THAT ARE UNUSUAL FOR US AS UNIVERSITY SO I WOULD I WOULD OBSERVE THAT WE INSTITUTED THIS SHORTLY BEFORE WE WERE PICKETING RIGHTS OF WE REALLY ONLY HAVE THE FALL TWENTY NINETEEN- AND THEN FALL TWENTY TWENTY WAS IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN. SO WE'RE STILL TRYING TO UNPACK WHAT WERE THE IMPACTS HOW BIG WERE THOSE IMPACTS WHAT WAS THERE A FACT BUT WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED RIGHT THAT WE SERVED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY IN THIS CASE CLOSE TO NINE HUNDRED STUDENTS AND NOT FIRST ROUND- AND THEN AGAIN ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SO WE HOPE THAT. IT'LL STAY THERE BUT IDEALLY WE'RE HOPING THAT IT COULD BE MORE OVERTIME SO WE'RE TRYING TO STUDY WHAT WOULD HELP FACILITATE STUDENTS ACCEPTING OUR OFFER OF ADMISSION THROUGH REDIRECTION. AND WE AND WE WERE VERY PLEASANTLY I'M ALL I'M PLEASANTLY SURPRISED JUST LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS AS WELL BECAUSE THIS IS A POLICY THAT WE WORKED OUT WITH- YOU KNOW CHANCE RIGHT AT THAT TIME. ALL RIGHT DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHY- I MEAN THERE ARE NOT ANOTHER NUMBER CAMPUSES ARE UNDER AND ROLL BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY SAN FRANCISCO STATE IN THE MINGUS HILLS HAVE KIND OF SEEN THE. MOST INTEREST IN TERMS OF REDIRECTION. SO I THINK IT'S A- TO. THAT- THE REDIRECTION DATA WAS IN BALANCE SO YOU HAD A SMALL NUMBER OF CSU CAMPUSES THAT WERE THE PRIMARY CENTERS. OF STUDENTS FOR REDIRECTION RIGHT AND THEN THERE ON IMPACTED CAMPUSES WHO WERE RECEIVERS. AND WE LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN THIS AND I THINK I SHARED EARLIER THIS MORNING. IS THAT IN THE END STUDENTS ARE STILL APPLYING TO A PARTICULAR CAMPUS FOR ITS BRAND FOR ITS DISTINCTIVENESS FOR ITS NICHE. FOR THE PARTICULAR CLIMATE OR EXPERIENCE THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND OFTENTIMES LOCATION IS GOING TO BE A KEY. AND I WILL JUST FRIENDLY OBSERVE THAT THE LARGER SENDING CAMPUSES ARE IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION RIGHT STEP. BACK FOR SOME STUDENTS CONSIDERING AN OFFER TO ATTEND A SCHOOL THAT IS IN ANOTHER REGION WAS A BIT PROHIBITIVE. SO I DO THINK WE ATTRIBUTE THAT BOTH SAN FRANCISCO AND DOMINGUEZ HILLS HAD HIGHER NUMBERS. IN PART BECAUSE THEY WERE IN METROPOLITANAREAS SO ACCESS WAS. A FACTOR. AND THEN THOSE ARE THE TWO CAMPUSES THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO MAKE IT TELLS IS THE ONLY ONE RIGHT NOW WHO'S NOT IMPACTED IN THE SO CAL REGION. GOT IT SO THAT MAKES SENSE TO BASICALLY YEAH YOU KNOW IF YOU APPLY TO FULLER TENDED YOU PLAN TO LONG BEACH STATE AND COULDN'T GET INTO THOSE PLACES BUT- EXACTLY YOU KNOW YOU CAN TAKE A DIFFERENT FREEWAY GO TO DOMINGUEZ HILLS. SO THAT'S RIGHT NOT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE NO WRITTEN. WE REALLY APPRECIATE I THINK THE- THE SYSTEM JUST. TO WORK WITH US AND WE WANT. THE POLICY THEN- WE THOUGHT WE WERE JUST VERY PLEASED ABOUT THE SMOOTH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICY SO I JUST WANTED TO JUST. IN PARTICULAR JUST CAN THANK FORMER CHANCELLOR WHITE AND OBVIOUSLY A CHANCE ACOSTA BUT ALL BUT ALL THE ALL THE TEAM DOWN IN LONG BEACH FOR REALLY MAKING THAT HAPPEN. I'M IN TERMS OF ENROLLMENT I KNOW THAT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT TROUBLING TO SEE. A DIP IN APPLICATIONS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE ENROLLMENT AT LEAST SLIGHTLY INCREASED IN TWENTY TWENTY DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT A WOMAN WILL KEEP KEEP GOING UP ARE YOU CONCERNED BECAUSE OF THE- THE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS ATTACK COULD RESULT IN LOWER ENROLLMENT. OKAY SO I CAN'T THIS A PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW THE ARE AND SCIENCE OF ENROLLMENT PROJECTIONS IS ALWAYS BASED ON PAST PATTERNS OF STUDENT BEHAVIOR. AND GIVEN THAT ALL OF THOSE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED. OUR ABILITY OUR EIGHT BALL IS BROKEN. TO LOOK AT IT SO WE WERE CERTAINLY PLEASED TO SEE THAT OUR ROMANCE UNLIKE OTHER SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE U. S. DID NOT TAKE A DIP THIS PAST FALL. AND I THINK AN EARLIER REPORTED AND RIGHT NOW AS OF EARLY MARCH OUR APPLICATIONS FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE ONLY 3% BELOW THE PRIOR YEAR. SO I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS ARE NOT ENROLLMENT APPLICATION IS JUST WHAT WE CALL THE BEGINNING OF THE TOTAL ENROLLMENT FINAL IT'S THE START OF A STUDENT'S JOURNEY TO POSSIBLY ENROLL WITH THE CSU SO WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN ADMIT ALL OF OUR ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. AND HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO ENROLL SO THAT WE CAN EMPHASIZE HOW MORE THAN EVER NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET A HIGHER EDUCATION CREDENTIAL SO THAT YOU CAN BUY FOR YOURSELVES AGAINST THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THIS FINANCIAL TURMOIL. SO WE'LL SEE WE CERTAINLY HOPE WE CAN SUSTAIN AND MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE WHAT WE HOPE WE HOPE SO AS WELL. RIGHT AND THEN GOING TO THE MY LAST POINT WHICH I THINK IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH IS. REALLY AROUND GRADUATION RATES- YOU I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THERE SEEMS LIKE THERE'S BEEN DEFINITELY SOME PROGRESS ON THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE- SOME NOT AS MUCH PROGRESS ON THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE I KNOW THAT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IS ASKING FOR. I BELIEVE- SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR ON GOING. TO SUPPORT THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW THE GRADUATION ISSUES GOING AND SORT OF WHAT WE COULD KIND OF HOPE. FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR SO. WHAT BUT THIS IS FOR STORE WITH ISSUE IN THEN I'LL ASK ME TO EVANS TO TALK ABOUT THE PERSON. AND MOST OF THINGS GREATNESS. SO- SOME TEAM- WE- FOR AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY SIX MILLION IS ON TOP OF THE ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. IN JANUARY SO WHAT THAT WILL DO IS THAT SIXTY SIX MILLION ABOVE THAT AMOUNT. WOULD THEN ALLOW US TO FULLY FUND OUR GRADUATION ACTIONS ARE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS AND THEN I'LL I'LL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER EVANS. THANK YOU MISTER STORM AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER TANG I'VE NAY CAN HAPPENS- FROM ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION- THE FOCUS ON THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IS CERTAINLY BEEN. THE HALLMARK EFFORT OF THE CSU- CERTAINLY UNDER CHANCELLOR EMERITUS WHITE AND THEN CHANCELLOR CASTRO HAS IN MANY WAYS DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT AND FOCUSED. ON THE REMAINING EQUITY GAPS THAT EXIST ON TO YOUR POINT WE HAVE MADE. STRONG STEADY PROGRESS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRAJECTORIES ALTHOUGH WE ALWAYS KNOW THERE CAN BE FLUCTUATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR ALL OF OUR OVERALL PROJECTIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET BOTH THE- THE- FIRST YEAR STUDENT GOALS AND THE TRANSFER STUDENT GOALS- IN FACT. FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS WERE ALREADY WITHIN JUST ONE PERCENTAGE POINT OF OUR- SECURE PURSUED ME FOR YOUR METRIC ALREADY- BUT HIS CHANCER CASTRO'S EXPRESSED OUR ABSOLUTE FOCUS IN THE BALANCE OF TIME LEFT IN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. IS ON ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS AND I KNOW THAT WHEN HE WAS BEFORE THIS GROUP HE SHARED THE BENEFIT OF. LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING THAT A NUMBER OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE ALREADY ELIMINATED THOSE EQUITY GAPS AND HE SHARED EVEN WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I MENTIONED THIS THIS MORNING. WITH THREE CAMPUSES THERE WERE SIMILAR STUDENT POPULATIONS WE HAVE SOME CAMPUSES FOR EXAMPLE STANISLAUS THAT IS. EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED THE EQUITY GAP FOR PELL RECIPIENTS AND SO ENSURING THAT WE ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES AND PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE. IN SIMILAR REGIONS ARE BENEFITING UNDERSTANDING SO- WE'VE- JUST DELIVERED SOME NEW DATA AND REPORTS TO ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES WITH SOME STRATEGIES AROUND THAT. THAT ARE SQUARELY FOCUSED ON THE EQUITAS ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS AND IT'S REALLY NOT BETWEEN NOW AND THE REMAINING FIVE YEARS AND PUTTING. OF FOR THE PLAN AND LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER ABOUT HOW THEY GOT SOME. OF OUR SISTER CAMPUSES I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT. GREAT MAN OF FAITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO YOU. YOU ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO. HIT YOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TARGETS BASED ON EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON. RIGHT NOW- AS I SAID SORT OF THE TRAJECTORY IT ALLOWS US TO DO THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I WILL SHARE TO MISTER STORMS POINT THAT ARE ARE PLANNING HAS BEEN PREDICATED ON SUSTAINED INVESTMENT AND AGAIN WE'VE BEEN VERY APPRECIATIVE. OF THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT FOR GRADUATION INITIATIVE BUT WITH THOSE ASSUMPTIONS YES WE ARE ON TARGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS GREAT I MEAN THAT THE TO JUST REITERATE IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT INITIATIVE I KNOW THAT- WHEN THE- CHANCELLOR WHITE FIRST STARTED WORKING ON IT IS. VERY VERY IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S KEY THAT WE NOT ONLY OFFER- STUDENTS ADMISSIONS BUT ALL OFF OBVIOUSLY OFFER THEM THE OPPORTUNITY GET THEIR DEGREE SO. THAT'S WHY WE DO THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU WITH THAT LET'S GO NOW TO ISSUE NINE THESE ARE RELATED TO THREE- A MISCELLANEOUS PROPOSALS FOR CSU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO JENNIFER LOUIS WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION ONGOING JOURNAL FINE. AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATIONS THIS INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS TWO MILLION ONGOING JOURNAL FIND TO SUPPORT THE ADOPTION OF A COMMON NORTH OF MENTAL LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE COMPUTING TALENT INITIATIVE AND MINISTER TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY MONTEREY BAY AND FINALLY TEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR FACULTY. THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR CSU AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY. YOUR WHOLE APARTMENT FINANCES JUST INTRODUCED HIM COMMON. HE. WHAT RIGHT WE FOCUS ON INCREASING DIVERSITY I PLAN YOU THINK IT COULDN'T LINE WAY THE STATE'S SIXTY AS WELL AS. FOR MEETING IT IS LIKELY IMPACT AROUND SMALL OF STUDENTS LIVING ONE FIELD AND- LEGISLATURE HE BACKGROUND. GRANT PROGRAMS TO STAND ACTIVITIES BEYOND THE- FINALLY REGARDING PROPERTY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND HE HAD FAILURE THIS MORNING. THE MISSION AND- WE GOT ABOUT HERE HOW LET COULD POSSIBLY SECOND YES YOU US AND ON THE NEED OF THESE. THANK YOU. FURTHER PART OF THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED REALLY TO EXPANSION. SOME QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SEE YOU. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ONCE A NATHAN FROM CSU OFF THE- AS WE NOTED EARLIER TODAY AS THIS ISSUE TO MAKE GOOD PROGRESS TOWARD GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- WE DO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE'S INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING WAYS TO SUPPORT OUR COLLECTIVE GOALS- LET ME MET NOW BRIEFLY SPEAK ON THE THREE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FIRST A LEARNING MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL- I WOULD BEGIN BY SHARING FOR NUMBER OF YEARS THE CSU HAS MAINTAINED CENTRAL NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS. FOR LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT ARE LEVERAGING THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM FOR VERY FAVORABLE PRICING- AND IS NOTED IN TODAY'S AGENDA FOURTEEN CSU CAMPUSES HAVE GRAVITATED TOWARD ONE SYSTEM WITH THE REMAINING NINE CAMPUSES ON OTHER PLATFORMS I SEVERAL OF THOSE REMAINING NINE HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN MOVING TO A MORE UBIQUITOUS PLATFORM IN THE RESOURCES COULD CERTAINLY HELP FACILITATE. BUT THEY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL ASSOCIATED COSTS WE WOULD ADD A COUPLE CAUTIONS- THAT WE HAVE NOTED IN OTHER CONVERSATIONS THAT SUCH AN ACTION COULD HINDER THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS FOR TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO GIVEN RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS WE WOULD ALSO BE CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIALLY CODIFYING A PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR VENDOR- IN ANYACTION- NEXT ON THE COMPUTING TALENT INITIATIVE- WE'VE CONTINUOUSLY LOOK TO IMPROVE. OUR GRADUATION RATE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS WHO ENTERED AND AS I REFERENCED A FEW MINUTES AGO OR JUST ONE PERCENTAGE POINT AWAY FROM ONE OF OUR TRANSFER GOALS AND THAT WOULD BE FIVE YEARS EARLY AND IT'S BEEN ACHIEVED THUS FAR BY INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS ON MANY CSU CAMPUSES IN THE COMPUTING TALENT INITIATIVE. IS JUST ONE OF THESE- AND SO THE US WE WOULD PREFER TO SEE INVESTMENT IN- IN THE TRUSTEES PRIORITIES AROUND GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND MORE BROUGHT MORE BROAD EFFORTS AND ADDITIONALLY THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE PROVIDE SOME ONE TIME FUNDING TO EXPAND THE COMPUTING TALENT INITIATIVE TO OTHER CAMPUSES WE ARE CONCERNED THAT ONE TIME FUNDING- DOES CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE START A PROGRAM AND THEN POTENTIALLY HE STARTED. ON A RESEARCH ON OTHER KEY. IF WE TRY TO START THAT UP SO I THINK OUR PRIORITY AGAIN WOULD BE TO FOCUS ON. THE TRUSTEES ADOPTED BUDGET. AND THEN LASTLY AROUND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROMOTING INCLUSIVE EQUITY BY TEACHING AND CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN A PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR PROFESSIONAL TO THIS DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM WIDE- IN RECENT YEARS. AND THE ONSET OF THE. PANDEMIC REALLY AMPLIFIED THE AWARENESS OF ECO IN. AND WE SAW A TREE. RESPONSE BUYER FACT IN. IN A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PARTICULARLY AROUND THAT CONCERNS ABOUT THE USE OF HIGH SPEED INTERNET AND DEEPER CONCERNS ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF INSTRUCTION FROM COURSE CONTENT TO LEARNING ACTIVITIES. SO THIS RESOURCE COULD CERTAINLY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR FACULTY DEVELOPMENT IN THESE ARENAS- AND WE ALSO THINK IT WILL HELP TRANSLATE BACK AS WE BEGIN TO RE POPULATE OUR CAMPUSES. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THESE ITEMS WE WILL HOLD OFF AND- INTEL THE- MAY REVISE. WITH THAT NEXT I KNOW MR MEDINA I REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS AND SEE ISSUES PERSPECTIVE ON THE FINANCIAL AID REFORM ISSUE NUMBER TEN. AND SO- IF WE COULD HEAR FROM THE CSU. OKAY HELLO AGAIN- STILL LOCAL HONG STILL THE ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR STUDENT AFFAIRS AND ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT WITH THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY ON THE CSCS APPROACH TO FINANCIAL AID AS WELL AS SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE PROPOSED CAL GRANT REFORM. FINANCIAL AID IS ONE OF SIX PILLARS THAT THE CSU WAS IDENTIFIED TO ADVANCE OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AN INITIATIVE DESIGNED TO INCREASE GRADUATION RATES AND ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS ACROSS OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. THIS IS PREMISED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT STUDENTS TIMELY PATHWAY 2 DEGREES COMPLETION RELIES ON PREDICTABLE AND RELIABLE FINANCIAL AID SUPPORT FROM YEAR TO YEAR. STUDENTS ALSO NEED FINANCIAL AID SUPPORT THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO THEIR SHIFTING REALITIES WHETHER SHORT OR LONG TERM THIS IS WHY ACCESS TO MICROGRAMS AND EMERGENCY GRANT AID IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF FINANCIAL AID SUPPORT. AS THE LARGEST AND ONE OF THE MOST ETHNICALLY RACIALLY AND FINANCIALLY DIVERSE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS IN THE NATION THE CSU IS COMMITTED TO INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE THIS MEANS ENSURING THAT STUDENTS TO REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES. EXPERIENCE EQUITABLE HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS AND ATTAINMENT. WE SERVE A NOTABLE PORTION OF HIGH NEED LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN THE STATE IN FACT OUR STUDENT BODY REFLECTS SIMILAR SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS AS THAT OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES MORE THAN HALF OF CSU STUDENTS RECEIVE A PELL GRANT AND 83% RECEIVE SOME FORM OF FINANCIAL AID. THIS MEANS THAT EVERY YEAR NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CSU STUDENTS AND FAMILIES RECEIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP WITH THEIR EDUCATIONAL COSTS WHILE ATTENDING A CSU CMPUS. UNLIKE MANY OTHER UNIVERSITIES WHICH PRIORITIZE LOANS IN THE FINANCIAL AID PACKAGING THE CSU AWARDS GRANT AID FIRST THIS FACILITATES UPWARD SOCIAL MOBILITY BY REDUCING THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF BORROWING PARTICULARLY GIVEN OUR SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME AND TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS. GRANTS CAN INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF FEDERAL STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL AWARDS. IN THE CASE OF THE CSU A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF STUDENT INSTITUTIONAL AID IS PROVIDED BY THE STATE UNIVERSITY GRANTS PROGRAM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SUGG. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES ESSENTIAL NEED BASED GRANTS TO BOTH ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND DREAM APPLICANTS. SOME WAS ESTABLISHED WITH THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION OF THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS NEARLY FORTY YEARS AGO. ABSENT AN INCREASE IN STATE SUPPORT IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE CSU BORDER TRUSTEES APPROVE THE FRAMEWORK FOR NEW STUDENTS AND FINANCIAL A POLICY THAT ALLOCATES ONE THIRD OF NEW REVENUE DUE TO TUITION RATE INCREASES TO SOCK. THE CSU COMMITMENT TO SUCK FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY IS MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF OPERATING FUNDS OF THIS NINETY MILLION SUPPORTS CREDENTIAL AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. THIS IS A REAL COST WHICH IS CHARGED TO EACH CAMPUS WHERE THE 8% IS ENROLLED IT IS A LOT MORE TO COVER THE COST OF SYSTEM WIDE TUITION AND MAY COVER UP 250% OF CAMPUS BASED MANDATORY FEES THIS LATTER IS LEFT TO CAMPUS DISCRETION. AND THIS IS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS IN ESSENCE THE STUDENTS TUITION AND A PORTION OF MANDATORY FEES ARE PAID BY THE CAMPUSES OPERATING FUND. STUDENT ELIGIBILITY IS BASED ON EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION WITH THE PRIORITY GIVEN TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHEN THEY EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS. ELIGIBILITY AGAIN IS BASED ON THE FAST OR DREAM APPLICATION. SOCK FUNDING IS A FINITE RESOURCE AND UNFORTUNATELY MORE STUDENTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SUGG THEN THERE IS AVAILABLE FUNDING OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE THOUSAND SO YOU SEE STUDENTS RECEIVE SOME SOCK AID IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I PROVIDED A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF CC FINANCIAL AID AND I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AT THE CONCLUSION OF MY REMARKS. I'D NOW LIKE TO RESERVE MY REMAINING TIME TO PROVIDE THIS UC'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION AN EQUITY% FRAMEWORK OR AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX SPONSORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MEDINA AND MCCARTY. GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF THE STUDENTS WE SERVE WE WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE CSU REMAINS FIERCELY COMMITTED TO THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES WITH WHICH WE BEGAN INTERSEGMENT ALL EFFORTS TO REFORM THE CAL GRANT AID PROGRAM AND WE APPLAUD C. SACKED. FOR LEADING WITH THESE PRINCIPLES THEY INCLUDE MAKING ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA CLICK HERE TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. ADDRESSING THE TOTAL COSTS OF EDUCATION TURN SURE HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS FOR INCREASINGLY RACIALLY ETHNICALLY IN FINANCIALLY DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION. AND PROVIDING ADEQUATE FINANCIAL AID TO SUPPORT DEGREE COMPLETION THE REAL ALL THE YEARS. AS SUCH WE APPRECIATE A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS THE CURRENT ITERATION OF THE CAL GRANT REFORM PROPOSAL THESE INCLUDE THE SIMPLIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA STRAIGHTFORWARD SIMPLE. THE INCLUSION OF STUDENTS AND ALL OUR COHORTS BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE THIS IS CRITICAL. AND THEN LASTLY REQUIREMENT FOR ALL HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS TO COMPLETE A FAST SO OR CANNOT THIS ALLOWS US TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE ALL AVAILABLE FORMS OF GRANT AID FOR EACH STUDENT. WITH A PROPOSAL THAT HAS SUCH. WIDE RANGING IMPLICATIONS THIS YEAR'S WOULD LIKE TO ENSURE THAT ALL STE. THAT WE ENROLL OUR EMPOWER ACT. AND BENEF. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT I'M DISCUSSION AND FURTHER COLLABORATION AND CONSULTATION WE CAN SUPPORT NEEDED REFORM WHILE STILL ENSURING THAT ANY MAJOR TRANSFORMATIONAL TRANSFORMATIONAL INITIATIVE SUCH AS THIS ONE IS SUSTAINABLE FOR THE CSU WITHIN OUR VALUABLE RESOURCES. AND THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN ACCURATELY IDENTIFY THE TOTAL COST OF THIS PROGRAM OVER THE LONG TERM. AS SUCH WE RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING NEXT STEPS FOR CONSIDERATION. WHAT. A COMPREHENSIVE MULTI YOUR MODELING PROJECT ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN HOW THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK WILL TRANSLATE IN REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS WE RECOGNIZE THAT NOBODY CAN COVER EVERYTHING AND WE'D STILL LIKE TO UNDERSTAND MORE FULLY THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH FACTORS AS AN INCREASE IN FASTER COMPLETION AS WELL AS UPCOMING CHANGES TO PELL ELIGIBILITY IN PALO MORE LEVELS AMONG OTHER SCENARIOS FOR INSTANCE YOU'RE MODELING CALL ALSO HELP US UNDERSTAND THE FULL IMPACT ON OUR STUDENTS BOTH THOSE ENTERING THE PROGRAM IN FUTURE YEARS AND THOSE BEING GRANDFATHERED IN SO THAT WE CAN BETTER SERVE THEM. AT A MINIMUM FINANCIAL ACCESS TO THIS YEAR'S FUTURE CURRENT OF MATTER THAT ALLOW STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO PLAN AHEAD FOR THE COST OF COLLEGE. INCREASE ACCESS FOR SOME SHOULD NOT BE A CHEAPER CONTENT POTENTIAL REDUCE ACCESS FOR OTHERS. SECOND WE WOULD REQUEST A HOLISTIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL HAS BEEN KNOWLEDGE AS AN INITIAL STEP AN IMPORTANT INITIAL STEP. A LONG TERM PLAN WITH PROJECTED MILESTONES WILL ALLOW US TO EVALUATE IMPACT FROM A STUDENT. INSTITUTIONAL AND STATE WIDE PERSPECTIVE. ENSURING COLLEGE ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CORNERSTONE OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA THE OTHER CALL THE CORNERSTONES ARE EXCELLENCE EQUITY ENTERTAINMENT AND THE CSU WILL BE MOST IN FAVOR OF A PLAN THAT APPROPRIATELY BALANCES ALL OF THESE FOUNDATIONS. WE ALL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BE RESPONSIBLE STEWARDS OF THE STATE'S RESOURCES WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT A COMMITMENT TO THIS KIND OF CHANGE MUST BE SUPPORTED BY ADDITIONAL DATA AND EVIDENCE. IN CLOSING WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO THANK THE CSX STAFF AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MEDINA MCCARTY FOR ALL THAT THEY HAVE DONE TO ADVANCE THIS CONVERSATION FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING FINANCIAL ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION WE ARE EXTREMELY ENCOURAGED BY THE THOUGHTFUL RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE ACTIVELY IN THESE CONVERSATIONS. MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. AND I KNOW WE'VE HAD. ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR STAFF AND SEES YOU IN THE STATE COMMISSIONS REFORM PROPOSALS BUT I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT THAT THE CSU SYSTEM IN YOUR ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WOULD WOULD BENEFIT. IF WE EXPANDED CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY IN OTHER WORDS- YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE COMPETITIVE A WORD FOR PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN. I'M SORRY WE HAVE ENTITLEMENT AND THEN YOU KNOW COUPLES THERE THEY GET THE COMPETITIVE AND THE ODDS ARE ONE INTENT OF GETTING AND THEN THEY HAVE TO COME KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR AND POTENTIALLY GET- YOU KNOW YOUR SON GRANT TO HELP PAY PAY THEIR SUPPORT- AND THEN WE ALSO WANT TO FOCUS ON PAYING MORE. THAN JUST TUITION THE NON TUITION COSTS SO THOSE TWO THINGS I THINK THAT WILL BE EMBRACED BY YOUR SYSTEM. AND SO THE RIGHT HERE IS THAT IS THAT WE PROTECT ATTEMPTING TO UTILIZE SOME OF YOUR INSTITUTIONAL EIGHT SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ON THE FLIP SIDE EVERY MISSING IS IT THESE DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE. THERE IT THE- YOUR RETURNED EIGHT ALONE AND NOT. YET USE THAT TO TRY TO ADDRESS IS LIKE WE ARE WITH YOU SEE. OR SHOULD. WE DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE GENERAL FUND AND FIND OTHER. TO UP TO FIND THAT PIECE REFORM. I CAN'T HEAR YOU. SORRY I MUSED ASSUMES DIFFERENT FEEDBACK- SO I DID I WANT TO FIRST START BY REITERATING THAT WE SEE MANY MERITS TO THIS PROPOSAL. R. FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT I CITED SO I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR THE SECOND PIECE IS THAT WE JUST ARE SIMPLY NOT SURE SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE MAY BE INCREASED ACCESS IN THE INITIAL- SHORT TERM YEARS BUT WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT LONGER TERM WHAT WILL HAPPEN. AND THERE'S SO MANY MOVING PARTS RIGHT THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE DIRECT LINEAR FORMULA THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THERE ARE BOTH WAYS IN WHICH WE WILL HAVE STUDENTS ARE INCREASE ACCESS. TO GRANT AID TO SUPPORT TUITION AND FEES BUT THEY'RE ALSO POTENTIALLY SOME STUDENTS WHO AS A RESULT OF THIS NEW FORMULA WON'T RECEIVE THE SAME AMOUNT OR RECEIVE LESS. THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING THAT IS COMPLICATED I THINK FOR US WE'RE MODELING WOULD BENEFIT IS THIS INTERFACE WITH THE COST OF ATTENDANCE SO WE BEGAN THIS ENDEAVOR IN PERFORMING CAL GRANTS. BY TRYING TO CONSIDER A MODEL THAT THE STATE BASED AID PROGRAM WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE COST OF ATTENDANCE AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL VARMA IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ENGAGE AND CHANGE THAT IS THAT SIGNIFICANT IN ONE FELL SWOOP. BUT WITH THAT SAID THAT MEANS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TRULY PACKAGE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL COST OF ATTENDANCE BEYOND TO REGION AND FEES WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW MANY STUDENTS. ARE WE WOULD BE LOOKING TO HAVE TO PACKAGE AND PROVIDE THOSE ADDITIONAL A GRANTS WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO AS WE RECOGNIZE HALF OF OUR STUDENTS COME FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE STUDENTS. EIGHT PACKAGING IS POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE TO THEIR PATHWAY TO THE FOUR YEAR DEGREE SO RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT MODEL IS TWO TIERED AND IT'S DEPENDENT AWARE YOU ARE ENROLLED. AS OPPOSED TO THAT THE STUDENT THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION SO THAT MEANS FOR EXAMPLE A STUDENT RIGHT NOW ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE RECEIVES. A GRANT IN AID TO SUPPORT COST OF ATTENDANCE ABOVE TUITION AND FEES I THINK TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT CONTINUATION FOR THAT STUDENT WHEN THEY TRANSFER TO THE CSU THAT AT A MINIMUM WE WOULD NEED TO CONTINUE THAT. ARE COMPARABLE LEVEL. AND ACCOUNTING FOR ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION. OKAY THANK YOU PEAK. YES GOOD THE THIRD YEAH- PIECE I THINK IT'S JUST RECORD THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER MOVING PART WHICH IS THE PELL GRANT. AND SO WE HAVE DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY RIGHT THE PELL GRANT IS AVAILABLE FOR SIX YEARS AVAILABILITY TO SEE SECOND TOTAL RIGHT BETWEEN C. SACK TO CAL GRANT TO AND CAL GRANT FOR. ITS FOUR YEARS SO WE'RE INTERESTED BECAUSE A NOTABLE NUMBER OF OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING TO TAKE FIVE OR SIX YEARS TO GRADUATE WHAT WILL THAT ADDITIONAL ONE OR TWO YEARS. LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF RECALIBRATION OF HOW WE ARE WARNING AID TO AGAIN MINIMIZE DISRUPTION TO THE STUDENTS PATHWAY 2 DEGREES SO WE JUST HAVE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK CAN BE ANSWERED. WITH MODELING AND A CLEAR SET OF ASSUMPTIONS OF WHAT WE ALL BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO THE MODEL AND THEN. PLAY THAT OUT INTO THE OUT YEARS. OKAY THANK YOU AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SYSTEM AND THIS IS A MULTI YEAR EFFORT BUT- A FEW THINGS- ONE WE THINK THAT NEW RESOURCES COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO EXPAND FINANCIAL IT ONLY HELPS OUR- QUEST- BREAKS MORE. MONEY ON THE ON THE ON THE TABLE. TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE MATHEMATICALLY IT PENCILS OUT. IN INTO YOU KNOW WE ARE INCREASING MONEY ENDS AND FINANCIALLY THIS YEAR ANYWAY. THROUGH THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AND SOME OTHER- EFFORTS SO- IN POTENTIAL THIS IS A YEAR OR TWO TO REALLY RE RE WORK AND KIND OF REVISION FINANCIAL LATE TO. PICK UP THE PIECES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST MISSING OUT. AS WELL AS ADDRESSED THE NON TUITION COSTS OUT. THANK YOU WHEN THIS WAS INFORMATIONAL AND- WE WOULD WHAT WE NEED TO MOVE ON WITH THE HEARING- OTHER STUFF SCHEDULED FOR TODAY SO WITH THAT THAT CONCLUDES. THIS PIECE OF THE- AT THE HEARING WE NOT PUBLIC COMMENT- THE PUBLIC CAN CALL AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DEDICATE- ONE MINUTE PER. PERSON EAGER- NOT SHOWING PEOPLE HAVE WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE TODAY BUT- THAT AT THE OUTSET. SIXTY SECONDS PER SPEAKER- CALL NUMBERS. SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN.

RATHER THAN CREATING ADDITIONAL COMPLICATED PLAYERS STUDENTS HAVE A CLEAR ROADMAP TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFER WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA HAS THE PROPERTY NEEDED TO ELEVATE AND SUPPORT AT T.
