TO HEAR FROM AUTHOR OF AB THIRTEEN TWENTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BARRICADE HAND. YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR EXTENSIVE WORK ON THIS ISSUE. AND THEIR DEDICATION TO STRENGTHENING PROTECTIONS FOR VULNERABLE CONSUMERS ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW. I TAKE IT OFFERS AMENDMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE TO STRENGTHEN THE GOALS OF THE BELL. BY REQUIRING RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF RECORDING A COMPLAINT. AND COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY THAT SERVICES MUST TELL. CUSTOMERS WHAT INFORMATION WILL BE NEEDED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. WITH THAT I'M PROUD TO PRESENT A B. THIRTEEN TWENTY A BILL TO PROVIDE NEEDED CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THE DIGITAL AGE. THE PANDEMIC IS ACCELERATED MANY TRENDS AND REVEAL DEEPER GAPS IN OUR SYSTEMS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE. FOR ONLINE FINANCIAL SERVICES. IF YOUR CASH FRANCE SERVICE LIKE VAN PAY AND- INCREASE IMPACT. WITH THE RISE OF AD PAIN AND SO. WHEN HEAD OVER A YEAR AGO. A LOT OF FINANCIAL TRANSITION TRANSACTIONS AND ONLINE AT THE SAME TIME THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR JOBS. FOR EVERYTHING FROM SIDE HUSTLES TO MUTUAL AID THESE CASH TRANSFER SERVICES EXPLODED IN POPULARITY FOR THE HARDEST HIT THEY OFTEN BECAME A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF INCOME. AND A LIFELINE. THESE SERVICES ARE A LIFELINE TO THOSE THAT ARE INSECURE IN IN TREACHEROUS SITUATIONS. THE APPS HOWEVER ARE OFTEN FULL OF GLITCHES AND SERIOUSLY VULNERABLE TO SCAMS. WHEN PEOPLE ENCOUNTER PROBLEMS ON SOME OF THE APPS ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY NOT ALL THEY OFTEN HAVE NOWHERE TO TURN AND CAN FALL VICTIM TO ANOTHER SCAM BECAUSE OF THEIR CONFUSION. CURRENT REGULATIONS DO NOT OFFER SUFFICIENT PROTECTION AND ROLLABLE USERS ARE LEFT WITHOUT RECOURSE. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY SIMPLY REQUIRES CRASH TRANSFER SERVICES TO LIST A CUSTOMER PHONE NUMBER. FOR THEM TO GET HELP PROMINENTLY ON THE WEBSITES AND TO RESPOND TO CUSTOMERS WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME FRAME. I WANT TO KNOW THAT I'M WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY TO FURTHER TAILOR THE LANGUAGE TO BE CLEAR AND REASONABLE AND TARGETED AT THE BAD ACTORS IN THIS SPACE WHO ARE NOT PROVIDING THESE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THIS BILL PROTECTS THE MILLIONS OF CASH STRAPPED FOR CUSTOMERS WHO RELY ON THESE FUNDS MORE THAN EVER. IT GIVES THEM ACCESS TO A LIFELINE PROTECT THEIR FUNDS AND HOLD COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE. WITH ME TODAY ARE SARAH ROBINSON DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT THE NATIONAL CONSUMERS LEAGUE AND CHUCK BELL PROGRAMS. DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY AT CONSUMER REPORTS. THANK YOU- WE WILL GO AHEAD AND HAVE THE SPONSORS WITNESSES- PRESENT. AS A. WE WILL HAVE THEM PRESENT CALIFORNICATION. A MODERATOR. MODERATOR. MADAM CHAIR WE DO HAVE A WITNESSES ON THE SPEAKER THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LINES MUTED ALL RIGHT SO WE WILL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH A TRUCK BELL. GOOD MORNING THAT CHAIRWOMAN WOUND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHUCK BELL I'M PROGRAMS DIRECTOR FOR CONSUMER REPORTS WE'RE A NATIONAL NONPROFIT MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS SIDE BY SIDE WITH CONSUMERS FOR A FAIR AND TRANSPARENT MARKETPLACE. THE POPULARITY OF CASH TRANSFER APPS AND ONLINE SERVICES HAS GROWN BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS WITH MORE THAN NINETY MILLION ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES NOW USING MOBILE PAYMENT APPS. IN OUR pRESEARCH CONSUMER REPORTS HAS FOUND THAT CONSUMERS DO SOMETIMES HAVE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS USING THESE SERVICES. AND WHEN THEY DO THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTACT THE COMPANY DIRECTLY TO GET HELP QUICKLY. YET THERE ARE FEW SERVICE PROVIDERS MAKE TELEPHONE CONTACT NUMBERS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE LEAVING CONSUMERS HIGHLY FRUSTRATED. A CRITICAL POINT TO BEAR IN MIND IS THAT BY NOT PROVIDING PHONE NUMBERS MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES ARE LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN FOR SCAMMERS TO POSE AS HELP LINES FOR THE AFTER SERVICE. AND GAIN ACCESS TO THE USER'S SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO COMMIT FRAUD. NEWS REPORTS BY YAHOO FINANCE FOX BUSINESS AND- DEPORT DETROIT FREE PRESS OF REVEALED THIS PRACTICE IS WIDESPREAD AND HIGHLY CONCERNING. IN ADDITION TWITTER AND REDDIT ARE FULL OF COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS WHO ARE URGENTLY SEEKING HELP FROM COMPANIES THAT THEY HAVE ENTRUSTED THEIR MONEY TO. SOME LIKE SIX OR ON TWITTER EXPLAINING HE TRIED EMAILING A MONEY TRANSFER APP COMPANY. AND WAS NOT ABLE TO GET A RESPONSE FOR TWO WEEKS AND IT WAS DESPERATE AT THAT POINT TO FIND A PHONE NUMBER FOR A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TO SPEAK TO. SO AS MONEY TRANSFER APPS BECOME MORE POPULAR AND INCREASINGLY UBIQUITOUS CONSUMERS ARE INCREASINGLY RELIANT ON DIGITAL FINANCIAL TOOLS TO MANAGE HOUSEHOLD FUNDS. BUT THE LOSS OF FUNDS COULD BE CATASTROPHIC TO FAMILIES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. WHO ARE RELIANT ON MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES SHOULD TO MOVE MONEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SEARCH SO HARD TO FIND HEALTH. PROVIDER SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO MORE TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM FALLING VICTIM TO SCAMMERS WHEN SEEKING ASSISTANCE. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS AB THIRTEEN TWENTY IS AN EXCELLENT FIRST STEP TOWARD ENSURING THAT PROVIDERS LIVE UP TO CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN THE EVENT THAT USERS ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES. ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMERS THAT WE REPRESENT CONSUMER REPORTS STRONGLY URGES AND- I VOTE ON A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY. THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE SARAH ROBINSON.

ALRIGHT SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY WILL BE ON THE OPEN LINE THEY'RE NOT IN OPPOSITION BUT THEY WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS SOME CONCERNS. DO WE HAVE ANYONE ON THE LINE. THEY HAVE NOT CALLED IN AS A WITNESS THEY MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE MAY HAVE THE SPEAKER JUST A MOMENT. IF YOU SIGNAL THAT YOU WISH TO SPEAK YOUR LINE IS NOW OPEN. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE JUST A MONTH THIS ON BEHALF OF ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ASSOCIATION. OUR ASSOCIATION DOES NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION AT THIS TIME BUT WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS REGARDING THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO ABC THIRTEEN TWENTY. WE THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE THEM TODAY. BEFORE I OUTLINED OUR CONCERNS THOUGH I WOULD WANT TO THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF HER STAFF AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HEAR OUT OUR CONCERNS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. THEY'VE BEEN GRACIOUS WITH THEIR TIME AND ATTENTION AND WE THANK THEM FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK OUT PETER AMENDMENTS OF ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. OUR MAJOR CONCERNS CAN BE OUTLINED IN FOUR POINT. NUMBER ONE AS AMENDED AB THIRTEEN TWENTY WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A LICENSE YOU TO REPLY QUOTE REPLY WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO A CONSUMER WHO CONTACTS THE LICENSEE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUES. AND IT IMPOSES SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE REPLY. THESE PRESCRIPTIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR A TWENTY FOUR HOUR RESPONSE WINDOW TO ANY OUTREACH TO THE LICENSEE CONFLICT WITH OTHER REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS OF LICENSE FEES AND COULD ALSO IMPERIL OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM POTENTIAL FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. NUMBER TWO WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE AMENDED- VERSION OF AB THIRTEEN TWENTY- THE REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE A QUOTE INDIVIDUALIZE REPLY WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF BEING CONTACTED- BY A LICENSEE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUES WOULD CREATE SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE AND LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES FOR LICENSEES. AND COULD DISRUPT PROCESSES CURRENTLY IN PLACE TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER CONCERNS AND ISSUES RELATING TO LICENSEES PROVISION OF MONEY TRANSMISSION SERVICES. THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE AN INDIVIDUALIZED REPLY TO ANY CONTACT RECEIVED BY THE LICENSEE RELATING TO CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUES IS BROAD AND VAGUE AND INCONSISTENT WITH CURRENT NATIONWIDE STANDARDS OF REGULATION FOR LICENSED MONEY% TRANSMITTERS. IN MANY CASES CONCERNS RELATING TO A TRANSACTION CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE USE OF AUTOMATED PROCESSES INCLUDING STANDARDIZED RESPONSES TO COMMON QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS TAKE FOR EXAMPLE A REQUEST TO RESET THE PASSWORD ON AN ACCOUNT. IN THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT WILL BE UNNECESSARILY DELAYED AT SIGNIFICANT TIME AND EXPENSE TO LICENSEES IF LICENSEES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED RESPONSES AS OPPOSED TO USING EXISTING. PREPARED GUIDANCE INFORMATION OR FEEDBACK THAT CAN OFTEN TIMES PROMPTLY ADDRESSED- CUSTOMERS SOME CUSTOMERS CONCERNS. NUMBER THREE WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF AN EXCEPTION IN THE BILL TAT WOULD ALLOW LICENSEES TO NOT RESPOND TO SUSPECTED FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY ATTEMPTS. OUR MEMBER COMPANIES TAKE PAINSTAKING EFFORTS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM FRAUD AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE DOCTOR AND FINDING WAYS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S LANGUAGE INCLUDED ON THIS POINT. NUMBER FOUR WE ARE ALSO SEEKING CLARIFICATION THE BILLING WHICH ONLY APPLIES INTERACTIONS WITH INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. AND NOT HIGH VOLUME BUSINESS ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE OFTEN TIMES MORE CUMBERSOME. TO ADDRESS IN SUCH A PRESCRIPTIVE TIME FRAME. WITH THAT SHARE NUMBERS- WE AGAIN THANKS B. FROM A NUMBER OF OUR KING AND FOR HER WILLINGNESS AND HER STAFF'S WILLINGNESS TO. TO WORK WITH US OVER THE PAST. FEW DAYS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT TODAY. THANK YOU WE WILL MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF AB THIRTEEN TWENTY IN THE GALLERY. C. NINE WE WILL MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. SCENE AND THAT WE WILL MOVE TO WITNESSES- WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION- TELEPHONICALLY. MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT ANY INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF AB THIRTEEN WE WILL BEGIN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME PRESS. ONE NINE ZERO. NO ONE IS SIGNAL BUT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. THANK YOU MODERATOR WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR DISCUSSION WITH MEMBERS MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. COENEN MOVE THE SEA NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ICE ICE US SORRY SENATOR BRADFORD. ONCE THE MICROPHONE. THREE ARE YOU CHARGING SECURITY FOR THE RESPONSE TO MR SAVANT AS QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES TO- THE ISSUES THAT HE RAISED WITH- THE SEMI MEMBER MINDED DRESSING THOSE ARE CLOSE THANK YOU AS A MEMBER BARRICADE HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON THOSE. S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YES AND THEY GET SENT AROUND FOR THE QUESTION THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND AND WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY. I THINK THESE WERE IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THAT AS YOU HEARD WHEN YOU CALL PHONE LINES FOR SOME OF THE SERVICES YOU GET A- NO CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME RESPONSE AND SO WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL. GAVE MEANINGFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE TO CONSUMERS. ARE ABSOLUTELY IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR TIME LINE ONE OF THE THING RAISED BY THE COALITION WAS WHAT IF IT COMES IN ON A FRIDAY FOR EXAMPLE SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TIME LINE AND WHAT IS A REASONABLE TIME TO RESPOND. THE INDIVIDUALIZED RESPONSE REPLY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AGAIN WE DON'T WANT THEM TO GET - RESPONSE BACK THAT SAYS WE'RE NOT AVAILABLE WHICH WOULD QUALIFY AS A RESPONSE BUT NOT A RESPONSIBLE MEETINGS WE PROVIDE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. AND WE'RE IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE EXCEPTION FOR PROTECTING AGAINST FRAUD OBVIOUSLY I AGREE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT IMPORTANT THING TO. STOP FROM AND THIS IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURES SO THAT IS OUR FOCUS WILL CONTINUE. TO NARROWLY TAILOR THE BILL WE ARE DOUBLE REFERRED AND HEADING TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHICH GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER REFINE THE LANGUAGE. THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER NAME AT THANK YOU ASSIGNOR BARRICADE HAND WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM. US SENATOR DOLLY. AND SEE NO I. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE WILL GO AHEAD.
