CAPACITY PROBLEMS NOTWITHSTANDING PARADISE DID HAVE FOUR ROUTES TO GET RESIDENTS OUT OF TOWN IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. WHILE MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE ONLY ONE. HAD THIS BEEN THE CASE IN PARADISE WE COULD HAVE EXPECTED THE DEATH TOLL TO HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH HIGHER. THIS BILL BEFORE YOU AB ELEVEN FIFTY FOUR. PROVIDES A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR PROJECTS RECOMMENDED BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION THAT IMPROVE THE FIRE SAFETY OF EXISTING SUBDIVISIONS. THAT ARE LOCATED IN HIGH OR VERY HIGH FIRE. HAZARD ZONES AND WHO DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH EXIT ROUTES TO GET RESIDENTS OUT SAFELY. A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT IT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. HOWEVER THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT NOW MORE THAN EVER ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASING NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF FIRES THAT SWEPT ACROSS THE STATE. EACH YEAR THE CREEK FIRE THE DIXIE FIRE THE CALIBER FIRE BEING JUST A FEW. THE BOARD HAS NOW RELEASED SUBDIVISION REVIEWS MAKING IT THE PERFECT TIME TO IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY AND PROTECT THESE COMMUNITIES BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. CALVET ANTICIPATES THAT THE COSTS FROM REVIEWING THESE CRITICAL. EDGEX WILL BE RECOVERED THROUGH LOCAL PROJECTS SIMILARLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE STATES THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WILL LIKELY SEE AN INCREASE IN PERMITS THOSE COSTS WOULD BE OFFSET BY A FEE REVENUE. AB ELEVEN FIFTY FOUR IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO ENSURE THAT PROJECTS IN HIGH AND VERY HIGH SEVERITY ZONES CAN BE COMPLETED WITH THE URGENCY IDENTIFIED BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY.

AS MR PATTERSON SAID THE DEADLY CAMPFIRE THAT DESTROYED MUCH OF THE TOWN OF PARADISE DEMONSTRATED THE PRESSING NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND EMERGENCY WE'RE PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB ELEVEN FIFTY FOUR BECAUSE WILL HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GET THE SECONDARY PRESS ROUTE PROJECTS BUILT FASTER REDUCE COSTS AND AVOID THE POTENTIAL PARTICULAR THAT LITIGATION THAT WOULD INCREASE COSTS AND LIKE FROM POLLUTION.
