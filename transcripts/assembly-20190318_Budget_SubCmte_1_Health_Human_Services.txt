I WANT TO ALSO NOTE THAT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT AS THE ACTING CHAIR. OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE ABSENCE THE TEMPORARY ABSENCE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER. JOAQUIN ARAMBULA. THIS IS THE SECOND OF TWO HEARINGS FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. I'D LIKE TO CALL THE PANEL UP FOR ISSUE NUMBER ONE PLEASE DO WE NEED MORE CHAIRS. POSSIBLY ONE MORE ONE MORE. CAN WE GET ONE MORE CHAIR TAKE MY THE BILL WILL BRING IT DOWN. WILL BRING A TEAR DOWN SURE [inaudible] YEAH. ALL RIGHT. LET'S BEGIN THE TESTIMONY I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO DO IT IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THE PANELISTS ARE LISTED -- MARCH DIVERS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS MARK STIVERS I AM AN ACT ALSO DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING CAMINO ELEMENT -- OUR DIVISION MANAGES -- THE LOAN AND GRANT PROGRAMS FOR THE DEPARTMENT -- THIS INCLUDES -- DEVELOPING THE PROGRAMS MAKING AWARDS AND THEN MONITORING THE PROJECTS FOR THE LIFE OF THE PROJECTS WHICH FOR RENTAL HOUSING IS FIFTY FIVE YEARS. A SINCE NOVEMBER WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING PROPOSITIONS ONE AND TWO PROPOSITION ONE WITH THE HOUSING BOND PROPOSITION TWO VALIDATED THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM -- IN OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS APPROPRIATE BY THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AND VOTERS. ARE ISSUED IN AN EXPEDITIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL MANNER. AT TODAY I'M GONNA SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ALLOWED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS BACKED BY REVENUES FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT TAX. THE LAST OF THE LEGISLATURE PLACE PROPOSITION TWO ON THE BALLOT TO ALLOW VOTERS TO VALIDATE THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM THERE HAD BEEN SOME LITIGATION AND THAT VALIDATION SORT OF HELPED CEMENT THE PROGRAM. THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING TO PERSONS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. HOUSING PROVIDERS WORK WITH COUNTY COORDINATED INTEREST SYSTEMS TO PRIORITIZE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND UTILIZED AND AND THE DEVELOPERS MUST UTILIZE LOW BEAR YOUR TENANT SELECTION CRITERIA. OF HOUSING FIRST MODEL. IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT THE PROJECT PROVIDES INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES WHICH INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- FROM THE COUNTY. THE PROGRAM HAS THREE COMPONENTS -- SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IS AVAILABLE FOR ONE TIME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A ONE TIME NON COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO COUNTIES. AND THEN THE BULK OF IT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION IS FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. I WE'VE BEEN DEAL THESE FUNDS OUT THE DOOR. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS WERE MADE AVAILABLE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE FUNDS HELP COUNTIES DEVELOP COUNTY HOME OF THOSE PLANS ESTABLISH COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEMS. AND BRING PROJECTS INTO THE PIPELINE. A TODAY WE'VE AWARDED FIFTY EIGHT APPLICATIONS FOR ALMOST ALL THE MONEY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. WE SHOULD A NON COMPETITIVE NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY FOR THE HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN LAST AUGUST IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OF THE FUNDS ARE WORD ON A ROLLING BASIS AND COUNTIES HAVE UNTIL AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO APPLY. AND UNTIL FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO SUBMIT INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS TO USE WITH THOSE FUNDS WITH. I EACH COUNTIES ALLOCATION IS BASED ON THE HUD POINT IN TIME HOMELESS COUNTY SO IS AN AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR EACH COUNTY. TODAY ELEVEN COUNTIES HAVE A HAVE A HAVE REQUESTED SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN NON COMPETITIVE FUNDS. AND THEN WE ALSO JUST ISSUED OUR FIRST COMPETITIVE NO FOR IN OCTOBER. APPLICATIONS CAME IN AND ON JANUARY THIRTIETH WE RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION OR WE OFFERED A HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS AVAILABLE AND RECEIVED A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN APPLICATIONS FOR FORTY FIVE SEPARATE PROJECTS. APPLICANTS COMPETE IN THREE SEPARATE POOL SO THERE'S ONE FOR LARGE COUNTIES ONE FOR MEDIUM COUNTY SERVICE ONE FOR SMALL COUNTY SO THAT THE KIND OF COMPETING AGAINST THEIR PEERS. AT THE OVER SUBSCRIPTION THAT WE HAD IS IN THE LARGE COUNTIES SO THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED COUNTIES ARE UNDER SUBSCRIBE AND WE WILL PROBABLY BE. TO EXTEND THAT EACH APPLICATION MEETS OUR THRESHOLD MINIMUM THRESHOLD CRITERIA WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND ALL THE PROJECTS IN THE SMALL AND MEDIUM COUNTY POOLS. THAT WE EXPECT TO MAKE THE WORDS IN MAY -- AND THEN WE WILL DO IS NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY -- IS ANTICIPATED FOR SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR. THE PROGRAM ALSO HAS A UNIQUE FEATURE IN THAT COUNTIES OF WITH MORE THAN 5% THE STATE'S POPULATION COULD ESSENTIALLY GET A BLOCK GRANT -- WEEKEND -- THE WAR THEM BOTH THE COMPETITIVE AND NON COMPETITIVE ALLOCATIONS THOSE COUNTIES AND THEN THEY OVERSEE THE PROGRAM LOCALLY. A SORT OF UNDER THEIR OWN STANDARDS. WE ARE POISED TO WARD ACTUALLY JUST THE OTHER DAY WE ANNOUNCED THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN IN COMPETITIVE FUNDS OR TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN COMPETITIVE FUNDS AND NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN NON COMPETITIVE FUNDS THREE COUNTIES. THOSE ARE SANTA CLARA SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES AND WE DO EXPECT TO GET AN APPLICATION FOR THESE. FUNDS -- THE ALTERNATE ALTERNATIVE. PLACEMENT COUNTIES WE TRIED TO GET ONE FROM SAN FRANCISCO IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO QUESTIONS WE HAVE ANOTHER OF THE PANELISTS THE BUT WE ARE POISED. TO FUND THE THE THE THE ALTERNATIVE THE PROCESS COUNTIES HAVE PROJECTS LINED UP THAT ARE READY TO FUND IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. AND WHEN WITH OUR WORDS IN MAY WE EXPECT SOME OF THE OTHER PROJECTS TO START MOVING LATER THIS YEAR [inaudible] THANK YOU. NUMBERS ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. DO YOU HAVE NUMBERS -- THAT YOU HAVE A TO POINT WITH EXPENDITURES OF WHAT YOU EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF FOR THE TARGET GOAL OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE SERVED FOR THE FORTY FIVE PROJECT THAT WE HAVE IN HOUSE TODAY OR THIS MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING INVOLVED WITH THOSE PROJECTS AND SO. THE M. IN OUR ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE A SET GOAL FOR NUMBERS BUT WE DO EXPECT OVER THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM. WILL PROBABLY GET ABOUT TEN THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS WITH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES. SO IS THIS IN DIRECT RESULT OF THE EIGHTIES OF THE DEMISE OF THE MENTAL HOSPITALS KIND OF CUTTING DEFINING THE NEED -- CLEARLY THE CLOSER MENTAL HEALTH HELD HOSPITALS HAS LET MORE PEOPLE. ON THE STREETS IT WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. I THINK YOU KNOW THIS IS FOUNDED FOR SOMETIME BUT TO WITH THAT IT'S REALLY THE THE PASSAGE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT I THINK A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THAT THE CREATE THE IMPETUS FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. THIS PROGRAM NO PLACE LIKE HOME IS ACTUALLY A SUCCESSOR PROGRAM TO ONE THAT WAS RUN BY THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING HE HAS HAD TO FIGHT INSURGENCY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES LIKE HOUSING PROGRAM. THIS IS SORT OF A SECOND ITERATION OF IT -- BUT WE I THINK THE THE REALIZATION WAS MADE SOMETIME AGO THAT YOU KNOW THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE CHRONIC ILLNESSES IS TO GET PEOPLE HOUSE. ONCE WE GET THEM HOUSE THEN WE START WORKING WITH THEM ON SERVICES GETTING THEM ON TO TREATMENT PLANS AND WHAT NOT -- BUT IT'S SORT OF THE BEST PRACTICES -- NOW MENTAL ILLNESS. SUES THE SAID PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR IS A IS THERE A TRANSITIONAL. COMPONENT OF THIS HOUSING PLAN ALSO -- NOT NOT PROGRAMS FOR PROGRAM THIS PROGRAM IS SOLELY PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SO THERE ARE NO LIMITATIONS ON THE LENGTH OF STAY. THERE'S BEEN SOMEONE OF A MOVE AWAY FROM TRANSITIONAL HOUSING THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS LAST COULD BE YEARS IN LIKE VERTICALLY FOR POPULATION LIKE THIS WHICH IS NOT HAVING IT KIND OF A TRANSITIONAL EVENT. OF FOLKS IN THIS CATEGORY OFTEN NEED TO LONG TERM SUPPORT. AND THE THE PROBLEM WITH TRANSITIONAL HOUSING WAS AFTER A PERIOD OF MONTHS THE TIME WAS UP IN WHERE DO THEY GO NOW THERE WASN'T A LOT OF THERE WEREA LOT OF EXITS DEPARTMENT SUPPORT HOUSING SO NOW WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FOCUS MORE ON BUILDING THE PERMITS FOR OF HOUSING. UP FRONT SO ONE LAST QUESTION WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. WHERE DO YOU PLAN ON CITING THESE -- UNITS. WE AT THE STATE LEVEL WILL TAKE APPLICATIONS FROM ANY OLD WILL PROJECT IN ANY PARTICULAR LOCATION THE LIGHTING IS GENERALLY A LOCAL DECISION AND THE IN A LAND USE AND PLANNING LAWS. AND AS I SAID WE DO GET FORTY FIVE PROJECTS ARE QUITE A FEW PARTS ARE GETTING THROUGH THAT SYSTEM THESE CAN BE VERY TRICKY PROJECTS GET ENTITLED -- BUT THAT IS A LOCAL DECISION AND AND WE WAIT TO SEE WHAT COMES THROUGH THAT LOCAL ENTITLEMENT PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER. VERY GOOD OUR NEXT SPEAKER. HEY MERRY CAN'T WILL DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO -- I'M AWFULLY ADDRESSING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL RELATED A WHOLE PERSON CARE -- SO THE WHOLE PERSON CARE A PILOT PROGRAM AS OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA IS A PROGRAM THAT WAS INITIATED UNDER OUR TWENTY MEDICAL TWENTY TWENTY WEAVER THAT STARTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IT WAS A FIVE YEAR PROGRAM -- WITH THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN FEDERAL FUNDS THAT COUNTIES ARE OTHER ELIGIBLE ENTITIES COULD APPLY FOR WE DO HAVE TWENTY FIVE PROJECTS -- ONE OF WHICH BEING A CITY AND ONE A CONSORTIUM OF COUNTIES. SO THE IDEA IT BEHIND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WAS TO ADD A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND TO REALLY SUPPORT SPECIFIC INVESTMENT IN HOUSING AND HOUSING RELATED SERVICES. IN THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT PROGRAMS WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS DIAGNOSES -- AS I MENTIONED ARE 25% TWENTY FOUR OF THEM HAVE A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. FIFTEEN PROVIDE SPECIFIC HOUSING SERVICES TODAY AND SEVEN HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED COUNTY FUNDED HOUSING POOLS SO THERE ARE SEPARATELY FUNDED OUTSIDE OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS GIVEN THE FEDERAL LIMITATIONS. WERE COUNTIES ARE USING THEIR OWN FUNDING SAVINGS OR OR FUNDING FROM OTHER ENTITIES TO DIRECTLY PROVIDE HOUSING -- THE LIMITATIONS ON THE FEDERAL SIDE ARE FOR TENDENCY SUPPORT SERVICES LIKE FIRST FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT SECURITY DEPOSITS. AND THEN THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING SERVICES BUT ONGOING RENTS IS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE INTO THE COUNTY HOUSING POOLS -- ARE FUNDING THAT TODAY -- AND JUST AS A CONTEXT THERE ARE FIFTEEN OF THE TWENTY FIVE WHO DO SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. SO WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE ALLOCATION OF THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IT WOULD TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT PROGRAM TO RECEIVE FUNDING IT'S NOT LIMITED TO THOSE WHO CURRENTLY PROVIDE HOUSING SERVICES -- WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS NOT SUPPLANTING EXISTING FUNDING THAT THE COUNTIES IN THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PROGRAM IS PROVIDING THAT REALLY ADDING ADDITIONAL. DIRECT HOUSING AND HOUSING RELATED SERVICES -- SO HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO YOU WILL BE ABLE TO RELEASE THAT THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO IN TERMS OF THE THE PROPOSAL ON HOW WE WOULD -- DIRECT THE ALLOCATION AGAIN ALLOWING FOR ALL PARTIES ALL WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS TO PARTICIPATE WE WOULD BE CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN GOOD STANDING WITH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY NOT HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT. THEIR CURRENT OPERATION OF THAT PROGRAM SO -- WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO RELEASING NOT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS -- SO I THINK I ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS TO THAT YOU HAD FOR ME IN TERMS OF IT'S NOT LIMITED TO THE THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING HOUSING SERVICES WE WILL BE OFFERING IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL TWENTY FIVE TO EXPAND THE PROVISION OF HOUSING SERVICES WHETHER THEY CURRENTLY DO. AND TO ADD TO THAT OR TO ADD HOUSING SERVICES NOW WITH THIS FUNDING. THANK YOU. NEXT PANELIST. YOU HAVE TO MANAGE CHEN MEMBERS MY NAME IS TOBY EWING HIME THE EXECUTOR TO THE HOUSE SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THE THE COMMISSION DOES NOT HAVE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THAT ARE TARGETED TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS BUT BUT I BUT IN OUR ROLE AS AN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AGENCY. WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN MANY WAYS THE THE PUBLIC FACE OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGE IS PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND MENTALLY ILL IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO THIS IS VERY MUCH A TOPIC THAT IS THAT THAT IS OF CONCERN TO THE COMMISSION. WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WORKING TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS RECOGNIZING THAT UNDER THE MEDICAL SERVICES ACT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND MENTALLY ILL IS A KEY GOAL IT IS EXPLICITLY CALLED OUT. AS A PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION OUTCOME THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO BE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. I MET I MENTIONED LAST WEEK IN OUR PRESENTATION TO THE COMMITTEE THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING TO TRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE MONEY IS COMING FROM WHERE IT'S GOING AND WHERE THERE ARE AVAILABLE FUNDS. THE ARRAY OF PROGRAMS THAT COUNTIES HAVE IN PLACE WE ARE ABOUT TO RELEASE AT A TOOL THAT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO TO LOOK AT ABOUT. TWENTY TWO HUNDRED COUNTY RUN PROGRAMS SO THAT WE CAN LOOKED AT SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN LOOK AND SEE HOW COUNTIES ARE ALLOCATING THEIR FUNDS. TARGETING ISSUES LIKE HOMELESSNESS BUT ALSO MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH THAT OR ANY OTHER ISSUE WITH THE IDEA OF REALLY ENGAGING THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND. PLACE TODAY. AND THEN I LAST PIECES REALLY OUTCOMES. WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE INNOVATION COMPONENT OF THE ACT WITH COUNTIES IN A NUMBER OF AREAS THAT WE THINK WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON ON THE HOMELESS POPULATION PARTICULARLY AROUND PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVED BY FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. OUR ANALYSIS OF SOME OF THE DATA COMING FROM THE COUNTIES AROUND PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE MOST SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL CHOOSE A VERY HIGH RATE OF PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE LEAVING THESE PROGRAMS WITHOUT CLEAR INFORMATION ON WHERE THEY'RE ENDING UP. WE KNOW THEY'RE ENDING UP ON THE STREETS NO IT DOESN'T. ABSOLUTELY HOUSING IS A KEY COMPONENT AS AS MISTER. STEIGE SINISTER STARS LEFT MISTER TIRES HAD TESTIFIED -- WE SEE SOME TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES LOS ANGELES IS PURSUING A MODEL COMING OUT OF ITALY. THAT IS REALLY PRETTY CREATIVE AND WE'RE ORGANIZING A SITE VISIT GO DOWN AND UNDERSTAND THAT ORANGE COUNTY HAS A VERY CREATIVE PROJECT CALLED THE WELL WORN COUNTY. IT'S ALSO DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INTEGRATED CARE THAT IT'S NOT JUST IMPROVES PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO SERVICES BUT IMPROVES THE INTEGRATION OF THE SERVICES ON THE BACK AND I THINK. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY WILL TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THERE. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT IS WHAT IS THE UNMET NEED IN CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS -- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND QUALITY OF CARE SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING FROM EXISTING PROGRAMS PUBLIC OR OTHERWISE INTO HOMELESSNESS RIGHT? HOW TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE AND THEN HOW DO WE SUPPORT SUCCESS AND SO WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO COMMISSION IS REALLY TRYING TO BRING COUNTIES TOGETHER? THAT HAVE A SHARED INTEREST ON THIS TOPIC AND BUILD THIS LEARNING COLLABORATIVE'S. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT ISN'T FOR THE QUESTIONS RELATED TO THAT IS EMPLOYMENT. THERE IS A GOAL OF THE WHOLE SERVICES ACT AS WELL SEND EMPLOYMENT AND FOR MANY PEOPLE PARTICULAR PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT THE HOW FROM HOUSING FINNEY DEVELOPMENT IS DOING. IS TRYING TO DESIGN SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WORK AND LIVE WITHOUT SUPPORT. BUT PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE HER COMING OUT OF OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM FOR YOUNG PEOPLE HER COMING OVER TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. FOR MANY OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO CAN THE BARRIER TO STABLE HOUSING IS INCOME. AND ONE OF THE GOALS AGAIN IS TO REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT WHERE. WE ARE TRYING TO SET UP BUT AS A STRATEGY THAT WE CAN CONNECT MENTAL HEALTH DATA WITH EMPLOYMENT DATA SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT IS HELPING MOVE PEOPLE INTO EMPLOYMENT. SO THAT WE CAN CREATE SUSTAINABLE REVENUE STREAM TO HELP THEM PAY RENT. DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE REDUCE THE COST OF HOUSING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BUT WITH BUT WE WE WE DO SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR THE STATE TO REALLY BETTER POSITION ITSELF IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT COUNTIES ARE DOING UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S WORKING PUTTING IN PLACE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INCENTIVES. ANY ASSISTANCE WITH THINGS LIKE DATA ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN MOVE SOME OF THESE DOLLARS FROM. PAYING FOR SERVICES INTO CREATING THE AT THE ABILITY OF OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY TO SUSTAIN THAT PERSON IN IN HOUSING THAT IS COMMUNITY BASED. AND AND WHERE THEY HAVE THE FAMILIAL COMMUNITY SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED IN WAYS THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE WHAT WE WOULD CALL IN RECOVERY. I CAN TELL YOU IN MY OWN FAMILY I HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHEN HE'S WORKING WE KNOW HE'S DOING REALLY WELL. AND WHEN HE'S NOT WORKING WE'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HIM. AND HOUSING GOES ALONG WITH. HAPPY TO THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING THAT FOR THE MOST PART WE DON'T RUN. HOMELESS PROGRAMS AS MUCH AS OBSERVE HOW COUNTIES ARE OPERATING HAVE TODAY THESE ARE OPERATING. THANK YOU HAVE AN ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MS REVIEW YES THANK YOU I'M CAN YOU EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THE LA COUNTY MODEL BECAUSE I'M AN ALLEY COUNTY AND I KNOW -- THERE WAS SOME STATISTICS THAT -- LA COUNTY WAS ABLE TO GET TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS BUT IT WAS DUE TO MEASURE AGE WHICH IS THE A BOND MEASURE -- SPECIFICALLY FOR HOUSING IS THAT PART OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OR IS IT SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT -- I DON'T I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE USING THE FUNDING WE'RE ACTUALLY ORGANIZING A SITE VISIT AND WOULD BE HAPPY. TO HAVE YOU COME ALONG TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT SO LOS ANGELES COUNTY WORKING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND PUBLIC SECTOR PARTNERS HAS BEEN LOOKING REALLY AROUND THE WORLD AND IDENTIFIED A MODEL PROGRAM OUT OF TRIESTE ITALY AND SO THEY THEY TOOK A DELEGATION THERE AND ACTUALLY BROUGHT A DELEGATION. FROM ITALY TO LOS ANGELES. AND WHEN THEY EXPOSED TO THESE EUROPEAN MENTAL HEALTH LEADERS TO THE REALITY OF SKID ROW IN LA. THERE WAS JUST A TREMENDOUS SHOCK ON THE PART OF THESE FOLKS FROM ITALY WHO SAID THAT THEY HAD NEVER IN IN THEIR LIVES IMAGINED. THAT A PLACE LIKE CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE THAT LEVEL OF NEED AND THAT SORT OF YOU KNOW BLATANT. SORT OF YOU KNOW THE ABANDONMENT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES TRANSFER THE INTERESTING AS THEY PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CARE NO QUESTIONS ASKED IT'S WALK IN IT'S NOT LOCKED. IT IS REALLY DRIVEN BY THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND SO LA IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT USING AND IT TO SAY INNOVATION FUNDS AND OTHER FUNDS. HOW THEY CANDESIGN A PILOT PROJECT THAT WOULD PROVIDE A -- DRAMATICALLY LOWER BARRIERS TO CARE. AND THROUGH THAT STRATEGY BE ABLE TO WRAP AROUND PEOPLE -- AT THE SERVICES BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. RIGHT WHAT WHAT WE'RE HEARING THAT LOS ANGELES IS REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THIS SO MANY OF THE RULES ARE FUNDING BASED. NOT NEED BASED AND THEY WANTED TO SO WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL FROM THEM YET IT BUT IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THEY THAT'S A PRETTY AMBITIOUS GOAL LOOKING AT CHANGES AND HOW. SERVICES ARE FUNDED SERVICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE WHO CAN PROVIDE SERVICES AND AND AGAIN IT IS A SORT OF NO QUESTIONS ASKED TWENTY FOUR SEVEN IF YOU NEED CARE IT'S AVAILABLE. REALLY TRYING TO AVOID THE ALTERNATIVE SAID THAT WHICH ARE EMERGENCY ROOMS IN JAILS. BUT BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW A LOT BEYOND THAT. AND THEN WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE -- OR CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ORANGE COUNTY MODEL IS THERE IS THAT THE THING CONCEPT OR IS IT SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM A DIFFERENT. POINT CAN'T SO DEAD AT THE SAME GOAL BUT A DIFFERENT STRATEGY ORANGE COUNTY IS IS BUILDING A VERY AMBITIOUS PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. THAT. LEVERAGES THE ABILITY TO CREATE FACILITIES WITH PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS AND THEN YOU SERVICE DOLLARS MORE EFFICIENTLY AROUND FOLKS. IT'S LESS OF A COMMUNITY BASED MODEL IT'S MORE OF A HUB BASED MODEL WHICH SOME FOLKS THAT SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE THAT WILL BE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE. CHRONICALLY HOMELESS BECAUSE QUITE OFTEN THESE FOLKS DON'T WANT TO COME INTO A FACILITY BASED CARE -- BUT WAS VERY INTERESTING ABOUT ORANGE COUNTY IS THAT THEY'RE ENGAGING ALL OF THEIR UNIVERSITIES THEIR HOSPITALS THEIR INSURANCE PROVIDERS THEIR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS AS WELL AS PUBLICATION CITIES TO REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO BLEND DOLLARS. AND AGAIN DESIGN SERVICES IN AND LORING THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT REGARDLESS OF THE PAYER IS SO THAT I THINK YOU'LL YOU'LL HEAR CERTAINLY SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS ALSO. TRYING TO START WITH THIS PREMISE THAT THE COUNTY REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH OF ALL RESIDENTS. NOT BASED NOT BY FOR KATE BASED ON WHICH FUNDING YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR AND SO ORANGE COUNTY I DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT ON CAN WE'RE ALSO PLANNING TO GO DOWN AND VISIT AND THEN THERE THIS AGAIN IT'S INNOVATION DOLLARS AND SO. THEY'RE PRIDED WOULD BE ON OUR AGENDA LATER IN THE YEAR BUT BUT WHAT WE WHAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE IS THAT THESE COUNTIES ARE REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THAT SYSTEMS LEVEL. AND LEVERAGE AND TO SAY DOLLARS TO RETHINK WHAT SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS ARE NOT NOT TRYING TO SIMPLY TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO A PROGRAM THAT REDESIGN THE PROGRAM BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND AGAIN VERY MUCH DRIVEN BY THE NEEDS OF HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL FOLKS THAT WERE IN THE SANTA ANA RIVER VALLEY. THE PART THAT'S CONFUSING MILLER BUT IS IS -- HOW ARE YOU ACCESSING THOSE FOLKS BECAUSE YOU KNOW A EVEN IN MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE FOLKS IN THE RIVER BED -- HOW IS IT THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY ACCESSING IN THE POPULATION THAT YOU NEED TO SERVE -- AND THAT'S I THINK WHAT A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN MY OPINION BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T GET TO FOLKS THEN HOW CAN WE TREAT THEM AND SO WHAT IS THEIR SOLUTION TO THAT YEAH. WELL I MEAN I'M FORCE I DON'T KNOW THESE THE PARTICULAR ANSWER FOR THAT PARTICULAR COUNTIES BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN IN TERMS OF A COUNTIES ARE DOING -- WE IN A LOS ANGELES HAS ACTUALLY EQUIPPED MOBILE VANS WITH TELE PSYCHIATRY WHERE THEY ARE MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE WHETHER IT'S UNDER THE BRIDGE UNDER A TREE ON THE RIVER BAD. AND THEY'RE BRINGING CARE TO PEOPLE RIGHT NOT ASKING THEM TO YOU KNOW HEY YOU KNOW LET'S GET IN THE VAN A LET'S GO TO THE HOSPITAL THAT'S RIGHT. THERE WITH THEIR AND WHAT IS NOW THE OF THE INDIVIDUAL THEY'RE TRYING TO SIR TO THEY CAN BEGIN TO TAILOR SERVICES TO THE EXTENT THAT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE AND AND HIS OTHER CONSTRAINTS. AROUND THE REALITY THAT THAT PERSON IS FACING USING PEERS YOU KNOW USING. AGAIN TELL US PSYCHIATRY SO THERE'S A PSYCHIATRIST ON THE OTHER END OF THE OF THE YOU KNOW VIDEO CONFERENCE FROM WHICH IS IN THE VAN. RIGHT AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY DO A BETTER JOB OF MOBILE TO A BETTER JOB OF OUT REACH ENGAGING PEERS TO DO OUT REACH FORMALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE TO WORK WITH CURRENTLY HOMELESS PEOPLE. SO THERE SO I I THINK. WE HAVE WE'RE JUST BEGINNING TO TRY TO TAP INTO THIS LIST OF PROGRAMS THAT COUNTIES ARE PURSUING SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND. THE RANGE OF WAYS IN WHICH COUNTIES ARE TRYING TO ENGAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY EXCITED BECAUSE WE WE WE DO SEE LITTLE POCKETS OF INNOVATION AND EXCELLENCE. PART OF THE CHALLENGES THOSE POCKETS DON'T BECOME STANDARD PRACTICE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE WE'RE NOT AS GOOD AT FIGURING OUT WHAT THE RIGHT SOLUTION IS WHAT WE SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IS TO TAKE THOSE. AT THAT. POINT OF EXCELLENCE AND MAKE THEM STANDARD PRACTICE. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT A PART OF IT I THINK AND I'M SURE YOU'LL TO DISCUSS THAT BUT IS. SOME OF THESE GOOD WHAT IS IT GOOD PRACTICES ARE NOT BEING -- SPREAD OUT TO THE REST OF THE THE CAN WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND NONE OF THOSE COUNTY YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY'S DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SO. HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME BEST PRACTICES AND I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE TO WHERE WE CAN TALK TO ALL THE OTHER COUNTIES AND AND I KNOW I'VE -- THAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB RELATED ONLY IN SANTA CLARA DOESN'T FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IS GETTING TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOUR EXPERTISE OR YOUR KNOWLEDGE SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S SOMETHING AND WHAT WE CAN WORK TOWARDS. BECAUSE IF IT'S WORKING SOMEWHERE LET'S MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE COME BY A COUNTIES -- BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE BEST PRACTICES. AB ABSOLUTELY AND AND IN TERMS OF HOW THE COMMISSION IS OPERATING WE'RE TRYING TO FIRST. SEE IF WE CAN DEVELOP A DATABASE STRATEGY SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE'S EXCELLENT SO IT'S NOT BASED ON A SITE VISIT -- WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM A FRIEND SO WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THE ANALYSIS AND SAY YOU KNOW THAT COUNTY HAS BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACHIEVE SOME GOAL AT A AT A? IN ORDER TO PROCREATE COST AN APPROPRIATE STRATEGY ETCETERA -- BUT IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE COMMISSION BUT SO THAT THE COUNTIES THEMSELVES CAN EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND AND BILL THESE NETWORKS WHAT WE FIND IS WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE ANSWERS THE COUNTY OFTEN DO HAVE THE ANSWERS BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS FACILITATE THEIR CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER. WE ALSO NEED TO PROVIDE THEM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE MANY COUNTIES WILL LOOK AT THE THE NOTION OF ADOPTING SOME NEW PROGRAM OR TRYING TO GO OVER THAT LEARNING CURVE AND THERE'S NO TIME THIS NO RESOURCES THERE'S THERE'S OFTEN. INSUFFICIENT TACKLE ASSISTANCE TO DO THE SUPPORT. AND IN SOME INSTANCES THERE ARE QUITE. CLEARLY DISINCENTIVES AND SO WE WE FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVE TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR PARTNERSHIP THAT OTHERWISE DON'T EXIST WITH THE INTENT OF CREATING THESE LEARNING COMMUNITIES SO THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS DESIGNED TO GET BETTER OVER TIME. THAT WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE JUST BECAUSE WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT TOWARDS THOSE MODEL PROGRAMS THAT COLLECTIVE LEARNING AND THAT AND THAT CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. PART OF THAT THE MESSAGE THAT WE'VE RECEIVED LOUD AND CLEAR FROM COUNTIES. IF WE WANT COUNTIES TO INNOVATE THE STATE ALSO NEEDS TO BE RECEPTIVE TO THAT AND BE WILLING TO RETHINK SOME OF ITS RULES AND STRATEGIES AND REQUIREMENTS TO SUPPORT INNOVATIONS BECOMING STANDARD PRACTICE. AND THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE STATE AS WELL. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER REMEMBER RUBY I THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO THE VERY HEART OF WHAT IT IS THAT WE NEED TO DO HERE. APPRECIATE THOSE QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT. THE NEXT TIME THAT HONEY. TO I AM THE DIRECTOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND I'M ALSO GOVERNING BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION SO I'M HERE TO RESPOND AND I HAVE LOTS OF NOTES BUT I THINK JUST BASED ON YOUR QUESTIONS I'LL JUMP RIGHT IN. FIRST OF ALL THE COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BOTH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE GRANT. AND NO PLACE LIKE HOME SO ACROSS THE STATE PEOPLE SEE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFIT IN BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS WE'RE LEARNING A LOT IN THE TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES THAT OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS -- AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING IN SANTA CLARA WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE CONNECT THE DOTS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS OF THE DIFFERENT EFFORTS. TO REALLY FOCUS ON WHAT'S IN THE IT'S THAT HAVE NEEDS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS HE WILL EXPERIENCE THAT IN YOUR DISTRICTS WE CERTAINLY EXPERIENCE IN OUR COUNTY ALL THE COUNTIES ARE EXPERIENCING THIS. I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST IT'S ABOUT HOUSING AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSING -- WE ARE FOCUSED IN SANTA CLARA AND WERE I THINK WE'RE PRETTY OUT FRONT WE PUT A LOT OF INVESTMENT FROM THE COUNTY AND WE ALSO HAVE A BOND -- MEASURE THAT THE THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTED SO WE HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS. AND SILICON VALLEY TO TRY TO STAND UP HOUSING -- SO THAT'S VERY WONDERFUL THAT WE HAVE IT BUT WORLD WE HAVE A VERY STRATEGIC PLAN AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS HOW DO WE GET SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE. INTO STABLE HOUSING WITH PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SERVICES AND I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL A JOHN SHARON IN LA ALL OF THE DIRECTORS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THESE NEW AND INNOVATIVE THINGS. THE REALITY IS IF WE GET SOMEBODY HOUSED FOR MANY OF THE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL THEY'RE GOING TO NEED ONGOING SERVICES SO WE FACTORED IN FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PORT. FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL IN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND THAT'S OUR BUDGET THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SO IF WE HAVE SOMEBODY IN A HIGH INTENSITY PROGRAM. AND WE HOUSE THEM AND THEY'RE DOING VERY WELL WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO STOP THEM DOWN TO PSH PERMANENTS PART OF HOUSING SO THAT THEY CAN REMAIN STABLE THE HOUSE STE. AND REMAIN IN THE COMMUNITY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT OUT REACH I THINK ALL OF US HAVE MANY DIFFERENT OUT REACH PROGRAMS -- I AND I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH WHAT'S GOING ON IN LA AND THE OTHER BIG COUNTIES THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THIS. IN OUR COUNTY WE DO HAVE A REACH TEAM [inaudible] A BIG THAT IS THE VALLEY HOMELESS CLINIC AND ITS POSITION PSYCHIATRIST ALL THE DIFFERENT PLAYERS ONLY GO DIRECTLY INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND SERVE PEOPLE THERE WE ALSO ARE HOUSING THAT GROUP IN IN A PARTICULAR OFFICE SPACE NEAR VERY LARGE HOUSING FACILITY NEAR HOUSING FACILITY. SO THAT. RECENTLY HOUSE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE ABOUT LEVEL OF CARE -- I THINK FOR MANY OF THE COUNTIES THERE IS A LOT OF CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF THE THE COST OF BUILDING SOMETHING. THERE'S ALSO IN MANY COUNTIES IT'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF COMMUNICATION SO THAT PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE HOUSING PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND THAT'S AN ISSUE ACROSS THE STATE THE COUNTY SMALL COUNTIES MIDDLE COUNTIES. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TO ALL OF YOU IN SANTA CLARA A BIG PIECE OF OUR WORK IS REALLY TRYING TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AND LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HOUSE PERMANENTLY FIFTY ONE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS IN TWO YEARS THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT. WE ARE NOW HOUSING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE PER MONTH. HOWEVER WERE SEEN AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE PER MONTH WHO ARE NOW HOMELESS. SO WE ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT CAN WE DO WITH OUR SAFETY NET PARTNERS IN THE COUNTY. I WANT TO BE HONEST ALL OF YOU I'M SURE ARE AWARE THAT THERE IS -- INCOME INEQUALITY WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF SOCIAL INEQUITIES WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS. SO WE ARE FOCUSED RIGHT NOW ON HOW DO WE PREVENT PEOPLE FROM DROPPING OFF THE CLIFF. MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY WHO LIVE IN APARTMENT WITH FIFTEEN FAMILY MEMBERS SO HOW CAN WE PROVIDE THEM WITH FUNDING TO KEEP THEM HOUSED. AND PREVENT THE ONGOING INCREASE THAT WERE SEEN ACROSS THE STATE AND MANY OF THE COUNTIES. EVEN WITH THE HOUSING EFFORT SO I THINK THAT. IN FAIRNESS TO THE WORK THAT'S UNDER WAY AND IN IN TERMS OF YOUR LEARNING REALLY LOOKING AT PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS PROVIDING HOUSING AND PROVIDING ONGOING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SERVICES WE BELIEVE IS THE WAY TO GO. IT'S A BEST PRACTICE AND WE'VE PULLED TOGETHER MANY COUNTY PARTNERS AND MANY COUNTY DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE SERVING SAFETY NET PEOPLE SAYING OKAY LET'S LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT MIGHT BE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS WHAT CAN WE PROVIDE TO THEM TO KEEP THEM STABLE HOUSE. SO THERE ARE MANY MANY DIFFERENT PRONGS TO THE WORK -- I THINK THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY THAT. THERE ARE MANY MANY SOLUTIONS AND STRATEGIES AS YOU WERE SPEAKING IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND I KNOW THAT TOBY IN THE ICS LOOKING AT THAT THE COUNTIES ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THAT WHAT ARE YOUR BEST PRACTICES. NOW LA HAS A LOT OF FUNDING WE HAVE A LOT OF FUNDING BUT QUITE HONESTLY IT'S NOT JUST THE FUNDING. SO HOW CAN WE SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AND MAYBE SKILL THINGS DOWN FOR THE SMALLER COUNTIES AND THEN LEARN FROM THE MID SIZE IN THE LARGER COUNTIES WITH MORE RESOURCES. AND WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL THE CROSSWALK IN BETWEEN THOSE SERVICES. SO. SAID HELPFUL YEAH. THANK YOU MAX PANELS FIX JENNY. CRISCO BARBARA FIND ANY NOT ANYTHING TODAY. WE JUST NOTHING A PRESENTER BUT ALL GO INTO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE -- PERCENTAGE -- TO THE ADMINISTRATION SPECIFICALLY I THE FIRST ONE DOES THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE SIZE OF HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA AND AND I DON'T THINK WE KNOW. THAT EXACT POPULATION SO TO SPEAK BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED THIS HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MANY OF WHICH HAVE MEANT A MENTAL ILLNESSES. DANIEL BRANDON I WITH APARTMENT A FINANCE ALSO I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS -- AROUND HOUSING ITEMS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. RAMBLIN AS ILIO. WE DON'T HAVE A TO ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WE JUST. READ EIGHT AS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOTED THAT THERE ARE STILL FORTHCOMING DETAILS -- REGARDING THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT PROGRAM IN TERMS OF HOW IT WILL BE STRUCTURED GIVEN THAT IT'S A NEW THE INTRODUCTION OF GENERAL FUND IT TO WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY COUNTY AND FEDERAL FUNDED PROGRAM. JUST WITH REGARD TO SUCH DETAILS AS THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS -- THE WHATEVER LOCAL MATCH MIGHT BE REQUIRED FROM COUNTIES FOR THIS -- AUGMENTATION OF JAIL FUNDS -- AS WELL AS HOW TO INTERACT WITH OTHER PROGRAM IN OUR ACTUAL -- HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM SUCH AS NO PLACE LIKE HOME. THANK YOU I THINK IT'S IT'S BEEN CLEAR THAT THE FOCUS OF THE DISCUSSION IS ON WHETHER THE STATE HAS DONE ANY OF THE THINKING AND PLANNING. ABOUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT A COHESIVE LONG TERM PLAN. TO ADDRESS THE FULL PROBLEM AS COMPARED TO JUST THROWING A BUNCH OF MONEY -- AT THE PROBLEM AND WITHOUT ANY IDEA OF HOW WE'RE REALLY GOING. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM IT'S IT'S MUCH MORE THAN JUST. AND ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE US MONEY AND TO DATE THERE HAS TO BE MUCH MORE THAN THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN OUR DISCUSSIONS IN ADDRESSING VERY SPECIFICALLY THE ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL ILLNESS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO HAS TALKED ABOUT SPECIFIC TO LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES AND WHAT -- TRYING. TO USE THOSE SAME BEST PRACTICES ANOTHER COUNTIES AS OPPOSED TO EACH COUNTY DOING THEIR OWN THING I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I I DO WANT. TO YES MA'AM THANK YOU I JUST HAD A QUESTION BECAUSE HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT -- MATCHING FUNDS FROM COUNTIES WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE IT'S REALLY SMALL COUNTY THAT. ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE -- TO PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU STATE RIGHT NOW THAT THERE SOME MATCHING FUNDS REQUIRED FOR THE WHOLE PERSON -- PROGRAM UP POSSIBLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT WILL IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH ADMINISTRATION -- THEY ARE THAT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY THAT -- COUNTIES WOULD -- WE NEED TO SUPPLY A MATCHING FUND TO THE GENERAL FUND OF FOR THOSE PARTICULAR HOUSING SERVICES THAT WILL BE FUNDED -- AGAIN THOSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE DETAILS ARE KIND OF FORTHCOMING IN TERMS OF TO WHAT EXTENT THAT -- HOW WOULD BE STRUCTURED IN AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I'M LA COUNTY SO OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE? A LOT MORE FUN SANTA CLARA I'M SURE THE BIGGER COUNTIES BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE RURAL COMMUNITIES -- THAT DON'T HAVE THAT FUNDING IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT THAT REALLY WOULD BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THERE'S ONLY A FEW THAT HAVE THE A MEAN OF THE CAPABILITY I'M -- ASSUMING TO BE ABLE TO MATCH SOME OF THOSE FUNDS IF YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION AS TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THERE WAS NO MATCHING FUNDS OR WHERE THE WHERE WHERE ARE THE MATCHING FUNDS SUPPOSED TO COME FROM. SENATOR BAM HAPPY EIGHT TED TO ASSUME EVERYBODY I THINK IT CAN. HAPPEN YOUR SISTER YES -- MET SO ADDING AS THE LA YOU MENTIONED WE ARE STILL DEVELOPING THE REQUIREMENTS BUT OUR BIG OUR MAIN INTENTION IS THAT THIS ISN'T SUPPLANTING MONEY THAT THE COUNTIES ARE ALREADY PROVIDING. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT WERE REQUESTING THAT THEY PUT UP A ONE TO ONE OR ADDITIONAL MONETARY MATCH IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THIS GENERAL FUND IS AN OFFSETTING THE FUNDING THAT THEY'RE ALREADY. UP PUTTING IN SO FOR THE TWENTY FIVE PILOT AS LONG AS THAT'S NOT OFFSETTING YOU KNOW ANY EXISTING FUNDING THAT THEY'RE PUTTING AND THEY WOULD BE. ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING OKAY SO YEAH IF YOU COULD YOU KNOW PROVIDE THE INFORMATION WHEN AS IN THE FIRST AVAILABLE THAT WAY BECAUSE LIKE I SAID I'M I'M GOOD I'M IN LA COUNTY BUT I KNOW SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES -- HAVE THOSE. YEAH I HAVE THOSE MEANS I SEE I KNEW WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO ASK -- JUST IF YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. MISTER FRAZIER THAN MISTER RAMOS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF SO YOU YOU WOULD MENTION TONY THAT -- THE YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO APPLY THIS -- DON'T WE HAVE A MODEL IN PLACE FOR THE IDG COMMUNITY WHERE THE SEVERELY -- AUTISTIC WERE SEVERELY CHALLENGED INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HOUSE ROUTE CALIFORNIA HAVE WE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS. WHY ARE WE TRYING TO RECREATE THE WHEEL WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE THIS? THIS DYNAMIC IN PLACE. THAT ANOTHER AGENCY DOES ON A REGULAR BASIS AND I MEAN IT'S IT'S THE MODELS THERE. OF SO I MEAN WHEN YOU SAY YOU LEARNING OF WERE. I THINK WE'RE WORKING WITH TWO DIFFERENT POPULATIONS WE ACTUALLY ARE HOUSING. UP BY INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED AND FORMALLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED FOR WORKING WITH THEM TO CREATE MORE HOUSING FOR THAT POPULATION SO I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING FROM THAT GROUP. BUT THE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT HAVE BEEN HOMELESS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT EASE TO A HOUSING SETTING. IN TALKING TO MANY OF THE COUNTIES WERE DOING THIS WORK QUITE HONESTLY TO ENGAGE SOMEBODY WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HOUSE FOR A LONG TIME THAT'S A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. TO DRY TO GET THEM COMFORTABLE TO GO INTO A SPACE AND LIVE WITH OTHERS. MANY OF THE OUTREACH TEAM SPEND SPEND A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME HELPING PEOPLE DO THAT SO THEY'LL BE SUCCESSFUL AND HOUSING. SO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE POPULATION IN THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POPULATION THAT IS A MIX POPULATION BUT MANY OF THEM. HAVE BEEN OUT ON THE STREET FOR A LONG LONG TIME. A MINI HOW ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE I WAS AT A CONFERENCE IS LAST WEEK WILL TELL YOU THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO OUT REACH TEAM WAS TELLING ME THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES. TO REACH OUT TO INDIVIDUALS AND REALLY GET THEM COMFORTABLY HOUSE NO THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR EVERYBODY. BUT THERE'S A PART OF THIS POPULATION WHERE THAT'S TRUE I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE HAD THE SAME ISSUE WHEN WE DEMISE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THAT THEY WANT TO LEAVE ALSO SO. WHAT I'M SAYING IS I THINK THERE'S SO MANY PARALLELS THAT? ARE YOU SHOULD BE UTILIZED IN THIS IN THIS -- BUILDING CAPACITY KIND OF EFFORT AND HELLO THE MOST EFFICIENT IS DO WE KNOW. SO I THINK WE'RE WE'RE JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THAT POPULATION IN PROVIDING HOUSING WITH THEM MISTER ROSS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON I'M LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM AND I ALSO MEDINA COUNTY WE LOOKED AT CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. AS A BRICK AND MORTAR BRINGING -- THOSE AND ENFORCEMENT SO THAT THEY CAN GET BACK -- PATROLLING THE STREETS THAT ARE THERE RIGHT AND UNCLOG IN SOME OF THE EMERGENCY ROOMS WERE SEEN A LOT OF THOSE. WITH MINERAL MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES GOING STRAIGHT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM SOMETIMES SO IN IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AND DIFFERENT COUNTIES. IS CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS -- BEING AT A TOPIC OF HOW TO TREAT DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE COMMUNITIES AS FAR AS A LONG TERM SOLUTION TO IT CERTAINLY COST FACTORS ARE HERE NOW BUT IN THE LONG RUN. THEY COULD BENEFIT RIGHT IN OUT WAY THE COST THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY SO IS CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS BEING SOMETHING THAT WERE ADVOCATING FOR OR SEEN THAT SPRING IS SOME RESOLVE TO THE MENTAL HEALTH. YES AND YES AND MANY OF THE COUNTIES IN OUR COUNTY AS WELL. SO CRISIS STABILIZATION IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO BRING SOMEBODY RATHER THAN GOING TO AN EMERGENCY PSYCH. IN AND AND WORKING REALLY CLOSELY YEAR CAN I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH WHAT YOU'RE COUNTIES DOING -- IN SAMPOERNA DINO BUT ALSO TRYING TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM WINDING UP IN JAIL BECAUSE THEY'RE ON THE STREET THEY MAY NOT NEED AN INVOLUNTARY HOLDS REQUIREMENT. AND SO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS ARE NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WHEN OFTEN THE BRING THEM TO CUSTODY SO CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE COMMUNITY. I THINK THE MAJORITY OF COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THOSE SERVICES AND THE IDEAS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FIND THAT THROUGH MIL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH IS WHAT WE USE. BUT YOU CAN BRING PEOPLE THEY TO GET THEM CONNECTED TO LONGER TERM SERVICES SO YES IT'S A VERY VALUABLE SERVICE. WIDELY USED. DOCTOR WOULD. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS -- PRESENTATION. I'M CURIOUS I I REPRESENT PRETTY RURAL COUNTIES AND SO. IS THERE THE IS THIS GOING TO BE SOME THERE'LL BE SOME FLEXIBILITY AROUND HOW THESE ARE DONE -- BECAUSE NOT ALL THE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICES AND SO MY CONCERN IS THAT IF. BUT ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS TO WORK -- FOR MY DISTRICT -- QUITE FRANKLY -- AND WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE SOME LIMITED POPULATION CENTERS THAT ARE HUGE. SO NUMBER ONE WILL THERE BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOR RESPOND IN THESE TWENTY FIVE PROJECTS FOR SMALLER COMMUNITIES. I'M IN THERE WILL BUT WILL THERE BE FLEXIBILITY A RECOGNIZING THAT WE'RE NOT ALL THE SAME. TOO MANY ANSWERS SURE SO -- AMERICAN WILL THE EIGHT CS SO OBVIOUSLY WITH RESPECT TO THE TWENTY FIVE THEY ARE EXISTING WHOLE PERSON CARE I DON'T HAVE THE FULL LIST OF WHICH COUNTIES ARE YOU SO THEY'RE ALREADY SMALL COUNTIES IN THOSE PROGRAMS. BUT SO IT'S NOT NEW PROGRAMS -- OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDING WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A SEPARATE THING THAT WE HEARD MR DIVERSE TALK ABOUT EARLIER SO I WOULD DEFER TO HIM ON ON THAT LARGER AMOUNT OF MONEY. YET JUST WITH THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDING WHICH IS FOR DEVELOPING PERMANENT HOUSING PROGRAMS SUPPORT OF HOUSING. WE HAVE AN ALLOCATION THAT'S FOR NON COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO COUNTY AND EACH COUNTY HAS ITS OWN ALLOCATION. WE ALSO HAVE A COMPETITIVE PROCESS WHERE THE DIFFERENT POPULATION TEARS SO THAT SMALL COUNTIES ARE COMPETING IN SMALL COUNTIES. AND SO WE FEEL THAT WILL ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE THE FUNDS ARE SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE IN A FAIRLY -- EQUITABLE WAY BUT AS YOU SAID THESE ARE FOR EXISTING PROGRAM THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE PROGRAM AT ALL NOT A WHOLE PERSON -- YES. A LOT MARK. WHEN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT? AND WE'RE WE'RE FUNDING BRICK AND MORTAR PROJECTS. HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AND WE ARE PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THEY WILL BE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT'S STRUCTURED AND OF THESE LARGE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE COUNTY POOLS. HE SAID YOU HAVE SOME THAT ARE COMPATIBLE ON SOME THAT ARE NOT COMPETITIVE AT NON COMPETITIVE FUNDS GO ARE AVAILABLE TO EACH COUNTY -- FOR ANOTHER YEAR THEY CAN REQUEST THAT IN THE COMPETITIVE FUNDS. FOR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS COME INTO US BUT AGAIN THE PROJECT ONLY COMPETING AGAINST OTHER PROJECTS IN THIS COUNTY OF A SIMILAR SIZE OKAY THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS -- IT AT THE ON THAT WAS A STAFF COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS WAS DOES THE STATE HAVE A LONG TERM STRATEGY OR PLAN FOR DEVELOPING HOUSING. FOR THE TOTAL POPULATION OF MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS CALIFORNIANS DUMB. DANIEL RENDON AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD SAY PROVIDES A VERY SPENDING SOURCES WE DONE THAT TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS IN GENERAL AND ACROSS ALL POPULATIONS. AND THEN SPECIFICALLY THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDING FOR MENTALLY. ILL INDIVIDUALS. ANNOUNCES THAT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE DO EXPECT NO PLACE LIKE HOME TO FUND ROUGHLY TEN THOUSAND UNITS OF OF FROM IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND THAT MAY NOT BE THE TOTAL POPULATION OUT THERE BUT AS A VERY SIZEABLE CHUNK. WHAT IS THE TOTAL POPULATION? YES YOU CAN HAVE THOSE NUMBERS EXACTLY ON ON HOW WE KNOW WE KNOW HOW MANY HOMELESS THERE ARE. YOU HAVE A HARD TIME PUTTING DOWN HOW MANY ACTUALLY HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS WITHIN THAT GROUP -- AND FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE I KNOW YOUR YOUR INTERIM BUT BEING PART OF THE DEPARTMENT. WHAT IS THE ESTIMATE THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES LET ME BREAK IT DOWN LIKE THIS SO FIRST OF ALL OF THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- ONLY A PORTION OF THE ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS RIGHT A LOT OF THEM ARE EPISODIC HOMELESS. GIVE ME FAMILIES WHO JUST YOU KNOW LOST A JOB AND AND WERE ABLE OR JUST FAMILIES WHO WEREN'T AVAILABLE FOR THE RENT -- YOU KNOW THE THE INCIDENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS IN THAT GROUP IS PROBABLY NOT PARTICULARLY HIGH. AMONG ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATION WHICH IS I THINK MAYBE ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE TOTAL OF YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THERE WELCOME IT MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE IT'S KIND OF A THIS VARIOUS THINGS GOING ON THERE BUT IF. YOU KNOW A THIRD OF THAT GROUP MAYBE HAD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. SO IT'S YOU KNOW ROUGHLY. AROUND TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE -- THAT ARE ALMOST WITH THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS WITH WITH MENTAL ILL HEALTH ISSUES AND AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO TEN THOUSAND UNITS WITH THIS PROGRAM SO BUT THOUGH THOSE A ROUGH ESTIMATES I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY. WHO IS IT THAT IS GOING TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION FOR TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO HOUSE THE THE HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL? WE HAVE TO FIRST KNOW WHAT THE ISSUE IS WITH THE KNOW HOW BIG THAT ISSUE I. TO THEN KNOW WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE REALLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUE. SO WHO IS IT THAT MAKES THAT DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS AND THE NUMBER OF MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS SO THAT AS YOU PUT YOUR PLAN TOGETHER YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT. YOU REALLY ADDRESSING IT BECAUSE IF YOUR ESTIMATE IS CORRECT YOU HAVE TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND WHO ARE HOMELESS AND MENTALLY ILL YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB. IF YOU'RE GONNA DO TEN THOUSAND BUT IF THE MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS IF THE NUMBERS REALLY. FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THEN WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT PLAN THAT ENCOMPASSES MORE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF MORE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE HOMELESS AND MENTALLY ILL. WE COULD TALK WITH THE STATE'S A HOMELESS COORDINATING FINANCING COUNCIL WHICH I THINK IS ALSO TALKING ABOUT. GATHERING THE THE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FROM ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA TOGETHER HAVING A LITTLE BIT MORE STATE WIDE VIEW OF DATA -- WE WILL TALK WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION DOES EXIST SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU JEFF. MR MATHIS. SO I'M. THE MR STIVERS INCENTIVE PROGRAM I LIKE THE FACT THE YOU ADDRESS THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT STAGES OF HOMELESSNESS [inaudible] ON BECAUSE OF THE YOU KNOW A COLLEGE STUDENT WHOSE COUCH SURFING. THIS HOMELESS OR VETERAN WHO'S COUCHSURFING WHO JUST GOT BACK FROM DEPLOYMENT AS HOMELESS -- LIKE YOU SAID THE FAMILY THAT JUST LOST THE JOB AND MAYBE THEY'RE STAYING WITH GRANDMA. IT UNTIL THEY GET BACK ON THEIR FEET THAT'S HOMELESSNESS -- I THINK THE BIGGEST THING THAT REALLY CONCERNS PEOPLE ONLY THINK OF HOMELESSNESS WE THINK OF YOU KNOW THE TENT CITIES. WE THINK OF THESE THINGS AND I'VE BEEN TO THEM I'VE I'VE GOT OUT IN MY DISTRICT OF BEEN TONE. AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE IS WE HAVE TO FACE THE FACT THAT. THERE SUB CULTURES -- WITH HOMELESSNESS WITHIN THEIR SELF AS A CULTURE. AND IN EACH CAMP. HOMELESS CAMP WITHIN ITSELF HAS ITS OWN INDEPENDENT SUBCULTURE ITS OWN INDEPENDENT ROLES. HOW THEY GOVERN WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT CAMP AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS -- IN IN ITS VERY TRAVEL IT'S ALMOST LIKE WATCHING SURVIVOR ISLAND. BE BECAUSE THE THINGS THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. AND BECAUSE THEY GET SO CAUGHT UP IN THAT. MENTALITY. FIGURING OUT WHETHER THEY'RE THEY'RE MENTALLY ILL OR JUST. SO DOWN AND DEPRESSED THAT THEY'VE FALLEN INTO THAT AND THAT'S BECOME THE REALITY. SO I AGREE I THINK THE HARDEST. HARDEST IS FIGURING OUT. WHAT THAT IS BUT QUITE FRANKLY WE DON'T HAVE? ENOUGH TEAMS OUT THERE ON THE GROUND. EVEN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES WITH WITH THEM OUT OF THE CAMPS. BECAUSE WE KEEP TRYING TO THROW THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE GONE. TO A TRIBAL CULTURE. THE LEARN TO DEPEND ON THE EACH OTHER AND THEN PULL THEM OUT OF THAT AND THROW THEM INTO HOME. WHICH IS COMPLETELY FOREIGN TO THEM. IT REMINDS ME OF READING YOU KNOW PSYCHOLOGY ONE A ONE WORD OF THE YOU KNOW THE FIND THE KID THAT'S BEEN RAISED BY WOLVES OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S SIGNAL THE IDYLLWILD THROWN INTO A HOUSE. THE EXPECTING THEM TO FUNCTION LIKE WE THINK EVERYBODY ELSE IN SOCIETY SHOULD FUNCTION AND THAT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. IN A I THINK THE STATE'S FAILING ON THAT IN BETWEEN PIECE. BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE DIFFERENT FOLKS OUT THERE. THAT ARE ON DRUGS THERE ON EVERYTHING ELSE SO YOU HAVE THAT ELEMENT MIXED IN WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH ELEMENT. MIXED IN WITH THE FACT THAT THAT'S THE WAY A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE BEEN LIVING FOR DECADES. AND AND THAT'S WHAT THEY KNOW THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM SAFE. BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THERE THAT THAT IS COMFORTABLE TO THEM. AND IT'S SCARY AND IT'S TRAGIC BECAUSE WE THINK OH MY GOD HOW CAN HOW CAN THAT BE OKAY HOW CAN THAT KIND OF SITUATION. MAKE THEM FEEL SAFE BUT THAT'S US SITTING UP HERE ON A DíAS OR UP IN AN IVORY TOWER. LOOKING DOWN ON ALL MY GOD HOW HOW DO THEY DO THAT [inaudible] VOIGTS. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TEAMS. OUT THERE IN THE FIELD AND I HAVE AN OF FUNDING. GOING OF THOSE TEAMS ONLY A HANDFUL. OF YOUTH CRISIS TEAMS GOING OUT AND TRYING TO PLUCK THE YOUTH THAT OF THESE CAMPS THEY ARE TEENAGERS THAT ARE FALLING INTO THIS. BECAUSE I GOT A FIGHT WITH MOM AND DAD GOT KICKED OUT OVER A DRUG USE ISSUE. AND I'M A FIRM BELIEVER IN WE'VE GOT TO BREAK THE CYCLE AND GET OUT THERE TO THESE PEOPLE WHO WE DON'T HAVE AN OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND. IN THESE CAMPS WERE THESE COMMUNITIES ARE AT TALK WITH THESE PEOPLE. IN IN GETTING THE THE YOUNGER ONES THEY'RE GOING IN THERE. AND AND FOR GETTING TO EARLY A FULL AMOUNT. AND WE'RE STILL HYPER FOCUSED ON WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS HOUSING. I'VE GOT TO GET ALL THE ALL THESE HOMELESS OFF THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO LIVE IN A HOUSE. THE THE TOTALLY LOST THAT. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED ENDYMION HOMELESS. AND IT'S GONNA TAKE THE YEARS. TO GET THEM TO GO FROM WHERE THEY'RE AT INTO SOMETHING NOW. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER BOUT OF GOOD POINT YOU KNOW WE WE DON'T NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL HERE. VOTE THE COOKIE CUTTER PROCESS LIKE MISTER WAS BROUGHT UP ISN'T GONNA HELP EITHER. AND WE'VE REALLY GOT TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS. NIGHT A EVERY CONVERSATION I HEAR AND I FOR OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IS ALL ALL MISSED THAT CUE POINT OF OF HOW DO WE TRANSITION THEM IN. THE FEELING COMFORTABLE COMING BACK INTO A MODERN SOCIETY. IN INTO FUNCTIONING LIKE A CITIZEN. VERSUS FUNCTIONING LIKE SOMEBODY LIVING IN A TRAVEL CAMP. ME AND I KNOW WE HAVE GROUPS OUT THERE WE HAVE TONS OF NONPROFIT GROUPS OUT THERE BUT THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL OF SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET. OUT TO THAT IN AN AND I ALREADY KNOW FOR THE ANSWERS OKAY LET'S THROW MORE MONEY AT IT. BUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO SAYS OKAY WE'RE GONNA GO REACH OUT. AND THEN STEP TWO IS AROUND THAT WE'RE WE'RE GONNA FOR TO SOME KIND OF A GROUP HOME. TWO IN AND WORK WITH PEOPLE AND AND RE ENTER RATE THEM BACK INTO. A CULTURE AND THEN MOVE THEM FROM THAT TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S THE WORD OKAY NOW THEY'RE WORKING A JOB AT LEAST IN THE SUMMER TO STATES AND NOW THEY'RE OUT ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT. BECAUSE THEY'VE LEARNED ALL THOSE SKILLS THAT THEY'VE NEEDED. I MEAN YOU YOU'VE GOT A BABY STEP THIS THING OUT WE CAN'T JUST PLUCK SOMEBODY OUT AND GO OKAY LET'S GET YOUR HAIR CUT AND A SHOWER AND A SHAVE. AND NOW YOU LOOK GOOD HERE SOME CLOTHES GO GET A JOB. BECAUSE AT WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR DECADES AND IT'S NOT WORKING. AND I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER KEY THINGS IS WHAT WARRANT 24% POVERTY RATE IN THE STATE. SO THE ENERGY COSTS THE HOME CASA ALL THESE COSTS HAVE GONE UP AND UP AND UP ENOUGH. AND WE'RE NOT DOING A THING TO LOWER THE COST ON FAMILIES. IN THAT SOMETHING ALSO SLID INTO THIS. SO -- I I I WANT TO HEAR A PLAN THAT'S GOT MORE PHASES IN IT THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO ADDRESS THESE THINGS I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY TO GIVE THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSING. IT CAN YOU KNOW WHEN THEY PUT OUT ON THE STREETS FOR A LONG LONG TIME CAN BE A CHALLENGE I THINK WE'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS OF ONCE WE GET THEM IN THE HOUSING AND MAINTAINING THEM THERE SO I THINK THAT PART WE'VE DONE PRETTY WELL. IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S GETTING THERE AS YOU SAY A REACH TEAMS ARE IMPORTANT. WITH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NOW IN THAT REGARD I THINK OUR SPEAKER FROM THE COUNTIES TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE IMAGE AS A FUNDS THAT ARE GOING TO OUR REACH TEAMS SHE CAN MAYBE TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. STATE LAST YEAR'S SPENT FIVE AND ARE HANDED OUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AROUND THE STATE TO THE HEAP PROGRAM THAT'S RUN BY THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. AND THOSE ARE VERY FLEXIBLE FUNDS BUT ONE OF THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT THAT THEIR NAVIGATION TEAMS AN OUTREACH WORKER TO KIND OF REACH THESE FOLKS TO START. BUILDING THE TRUST THAN MILK BUT A LOT OF A LOT OF THOSE FUNDS AREN'T OPEN. FOR PROGRAMS THE DEAL STRICTLY FOR YOUTH. WELL THE THE HEAT FUNDS MY UNDERSTANDING I DON'T OVERSEE THAT PROGRAM OF MY UNDERSTAND IS THERE QUITE FLEXIBLE AND CAN BE USED FOR A LARGE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AND I BELIEVE. THAT THERE'S EVEN SOME PORTION OF THE FUNDS THAT MUST BE SET ASIDE FOR HOMELESS YOUTH IF I RECALL THAT CORRECTLY. MR SERVICES CORRECT THERE WAS A WE DID FIND THAT SOME CSC'S DID SPEND SLIGHTLY MORE THAN NOT -- BUT WE DID LEAVE IT UP TO THE COUNTY SUSPEND THE FUNDS AS THEY SAW FIT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY UM AGAIN TOBY EWING WITH MEN HAVE COMMISSION AS A MEMBER MATHIS IS CORRECT IS QUITE OFTEN PEOPLE ARE ARE. VERY MUCH STRUGGLING ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS -- ANNA THAT IS PART PART OF THAT DISCUSSION OF HAVING THE SUPPORT IF PART OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS THERE AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO BETTER. I ALSO JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT INTO THE MIDDLE HOW SERVICES ACT THE LANGUAGES PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AND WHILE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE THAT RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS. THE STATE ALSO SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE PUT IN PLACE A PLAN THAT IS MORE PREVENTION BASED. MANY OF THE FOLKS THAT THAT END UP ON THE STREETS IN THE COUNTIES THEY ARE VETERANS THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY WHO HAVE DISCHARGED AND THE TRANSITION. OUT OF THE MILITARY BACK IN THE COMMUNITY IS NOT AS STRONG AS IT COULD BE MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM OR THE COMING OUT OF PRISONS AND JAILS. WE WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT EARLY ALERT EARLY RESPONSE SYSTEMS TO ACTUALLY SUPPORT PEOPLE. BEFORE THERE SO CHRONICALLY HOMELESS THAT WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO TEACH THEM HOW TO BRUSH THEIR TEETH AND HOW TO GET UP IN THE MORNING AND HOW TO ENGAGE AND WE'VE WE'VE HEARD MANY MANY STORIES OF FOLKS WHO WERE NOT COMFORTABLE SLEEPING UNDER A ROUGH. BECAUSE THEY HAVE STEPPED OUTSIDE FOR SO LONG. BUT QUITE OFTEN WE FIND THAT THOSE PEOPLE ACTUALLY WERE IN SOME SORT OF A PUBLIC PROGRAM. THAT THAT WAS NOT EFFECTIVE IN SOME WAYS RIGHT OR THE WHERE THEY'VE SORT OF FELL OFF THAT SERVICE CLIFF. BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE MILITARY AND WE KNOW WHEN THEY DISCHARGED BUT WE DON'T REACH OUT TO THEM OFTEN UNTIL WE FIND THEM IN THAT HOMELESS CAMP AND SO IN ADDITION TO THINKING ABOUT HOW OUR RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS. THESE TO BE ROBUST WE NEED ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW ARE PREVENTION STRATEGIES. CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE HAVING TO RESPOND TO OVERTIME YEAH WILL THEN IN TO THAT POINT I MEAN. SOME OF THE DRIVES ME NUTS IN THIS IS JUST COMING FROM A VETERAN ADVOCACY BACKGROUND. BUT WHEN OUR VETERANS GET HOME. THEY GET A COUPLE BRIEFLY GET HANDED A BOOK HERE'S YOUR BENEFITS GOOD LUCK. NOW WHAT WE DO FOR INMATES FROM THE GET OUT OF JAIL. THE A PROBATION OFFICER THAT'S GONNA CHECK UP ON ON MAKE SURE THEY'RE TAKEN THEIR MAN IT'S GOING OF THEIR JOB. AND DOING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE TO BE ACTIVE IN GOOD CITIZENS BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY. WHEN WE HAVE KIDS WHO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL? ENTER IT NOW OR TO WALDRON OF AGED OUT OF THE FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAM. THERE IS OUT THERE. THEY THEY DON'T EVEN GET A BOOK THEY DON'T GET NOTHING. IN IN A LOT OF ON FALL INTO THE THE PARTY SCENE. THEY COUNT SURF WITH FRIENDS AS LONG AS THEY CAN. UNTIL THOSE RELATIONSHIPS END UP MESSED UP AND THEN THE END OF OUT ON THE STREETS. AND WE SEE IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SYSTEMATICALLY SET UP. TO REALLY CATCH THEM AND WALK THEM THROUGH -- TO FOLLOW THEM AFTER THAT. IN IN WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE MONEY IN HOUSING IN THESE THINGS WHAT ONE A LESSONS LEARNED. FROM WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH YOU KNOW WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND AND THE TRANSFORMATION WE'RE TAKING PEOPLE FROM DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. WORD SOMETHING LIKE. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AT A BED DOWN. TO YOU KNOW THEM HOUSING IN ON THEMSELVES AND AND CUTTING THAT DOWN TO LIKE THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR VERSUS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT FINANCIALLY WOULD MAKE SENSE. THAT HAVING PROGRAMS THAT CAN CATCH THESE GUYS AND GALS IN IN AND WALK THEM THROUGH. AND JUST STAY WITH ALL. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA. GO INTO THAT AND IT'S REALLY EASY TO TO BLUFF OR YEAH I'M DOING OKAY TO AND BUT UNLESS SOMEBODY'S CHECKING UP ON YOU KNOW. NOT WAIT WHAT DO YOU GOT BECAUSE THESE GUYS IT'S LIKE OKAY DID DID THEY GET ACCEPTED TO THERE ARE THEY GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO THE GET ACCEPTED TO A COLLEGE. OR THEY JUST GONNA GO WORK OR ARE WE TRACKING THERE ARE WE FOLLOWING THEM ARE THEY GETTING INTO A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THERE THERE'S WE GOT A HUNDRED ONE PROGRAMS OUT THERE. BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS ON BECAUSE THEY THINK YOU KNOW I'M SO SCREWED UP NOBODY'S GONNA LET ME IN ONE OF THESE. BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF THE MENTALITY. THEN HOW ARE WE GETTING THERE. IN THE SAME THING WITH VETERANS OF ANY THE THEY COME HOME LIKE A BOOK. HEY GOOD LUCK MAYBE THINGS GO FINAL FOR FOR A LITTLE BIT A HOME. AND THE HOME RELATIONSHIP DYNAMIC BREAKS DOWN. AND THAT'S WITH THE VETERANS SUICIDE RATES GO UP TO THE VOTERS HOMELESS GOES UP BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE GUYS. WILL GO AND THEN THE CALL ON THEIR BODIES HEY MAN. YOU KNOW I GOT KICKED OUT OR WHATEVER THEY GO LIVE WITH A FRIEND TO GO LIVE WITH SOME FAMILY FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT THAT DOESN'T LAST FOREVER. AND WE DON'T FOLLOW THESE GUYS. WE VIEW WE WE FOLLOW THESE CRIMINALS. THEY GET RELEASED BACK ON A SOCIETY WITH PROBATION OFFICERS WHO DON'T FOLLOW OUR VETERANS WILL FOLLOW OUR YOUTH. WHO THE THE THE TWO POPULATIONS WE NEED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR THE MOST WILL FOLLOW? THE GUYS AGO SHE GREW UP SOCIETY GET ALL THE TREATMENT ANY IN THE WORLD. THEY JUST MAKES ME SICK. SOME VALID POINTS THERE -- MISTER MATHIS AND I AND I KNOW YOU'RE A GREAT ADVOCATE OF OUR VETERANS AND I THINK THAT THE POINTS REGARDING VETERANS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. MR TING. THE MANAGER JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR MR STIVERS WITH A NO PLACE LIKE HOME COULD YOU WALK US THROUGH HELL THE MONEY'S BROKEN OUT HE SAID COMPETITIVELY IN NON COMPETITIVELY. YES SO THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL BE BONDED AGAINST ULTIMATELY -- ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY MILLION OF THAT IS FOR THE NON COMPETITIVE MOUNTS BASED ON A ON A COUNTY POINT IN TIME COUNT. OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. AND THEN THE LARGE MAJORITY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION I THINK. YOU CAME A LITTLE BIT LATER AFTER I TESTIFIED BUT THERE ARE. THE FOUR LARGEST COUNTIES THAT HAVE EACH THAT MORE THAN 5% THE STILL STATES HOMELESS POPULATION CAN GET IT AS A BLOCK GRANT SO YOU'RE FROM SAN FRANCISCO WE EXPECT AN APPLICATION FROM SAN FRANCISCO VERY SOON. THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THEIR SHARE OF THE NON NON COMPETITIVE POT. AND THEIR ANNUAL SHARE OF THE COMPETITIVE MONEY TO OVERSEE DIRECTLY. AND THEN I GUESS SEVEN GIVE MY CALLS CONCERNS FOR LIKE THE SOME OF THE SMALLER COUNTIES WHAT'S THE AMOUNT OF COMPETITIVE MONEY FOR THIS FOR THIS YEAH. AGAIN THE COMPETITIVE AMOUNTS ARE ARE PUT INTO THREE SEPARATE POOLS BASED ON COUNTY SIZE. I CAN'T. REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD EXACTLY HOW THAT IS BROKEN OUT BUT IS A FAIRLY SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF FOR EACH POOL. THE END AND PROBABLY A GOOD SIGN OF THAT IS THAT THE APPLICATIONS WE JUST RECEIVED WE WERE UNDER SUBSCRIBE IN THE SMALL AND MEDIUM COUNTY POTS. THE ONLY PART WE WERE OVERSUBSCRIBED IS IN THE LARGE COUNTY SO WE ARE PUTTING ON OF RESOURCES THAT THIS TIME ANYWAY FOR THE THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED COUNTIES IN IN WHEN WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO RELEASE THE MONEY. WE HAVE REAL RELEASED MONEY TO THREE OF THESE ALTERNATIVE PROCESS COUNTIES WILL BE MADE THE AWARDS ALREADY -- THAT IS THE LA. SANTA CLARA AND SAN DIEGO AGAIN WE EXPECT AN APPLICATION FROM SAN FRANCISCO FAIRLY SOON AND THEN IN OUR COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS WE EXPECT TO MAKE THE FIRST WORDS IN MAY WE HAVE THE APPLICATIONS AND HOUSE WE ARE REVIEWING THEM RIGHT NOW. GREAT THANK YOU. FOLLOW UP QUESTION -- WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THE ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS AND THEN THE THE THE MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS? AND I ASKED WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE BEST ESTIMATE THAT OF MY NOTES SHOW HOMELESSNESS COUNCIL. FOR A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE STATE VIEW LEGISLATION CREATED THE HOMELESS COORDINATING FINANCING COUNCIL IT IS -- CHAIRED BY THE SECRETARY THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY MISS -- PROTESTED. AND IT IT TRIES TO BRING TO GET THE THE GOAL OF IT IS TO BRING TOGETHER ALL THE VARIOUS STATE ENTITIES THAT HAVE SOME ROLE IN. HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE NOT JUST THE DEPARTMENT HOUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE IT'S IT'S A IT'S A VARIETY STATE AID TO THE TOUCH ON IN DIFFERENT WAYS -- AND YOU KNOW I THINK THERE. I WAS ON THE COUNCIL UNTIL JANUARY SO I LOST TRACK A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT. GOING ON WITH THAT PERSONALLY BUT THEY WERE SOARING PUTTING TOGETHER FURTHER ACTION PLAN FOR THE COMING YEAR -- TO SEE HOW THEY WERE GONNA AND I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IS AGGREGATING THE THE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM DATA THAT MUCH MOST COUNTIES HAVE INTO A STATEWIDE HOMELESSNESS DATABASE AS ONE THING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PURSUING. CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT IS NEEDED TO OF MISTER RAMOS. THANK YOU JUST TIME FOR SOME MORE CLARIFICATION AS FAR AS THE DATA COLLECTED. THE STATE DOESN'T GO OUT AND DO A A SURVEY OF A HOMELESSNESS IS AT THE FEDERAL POINT TIME COUNT THROUGH HUD. AND THE MCKINNEY VENTO ACTED THAT GATHERS THAT DATA THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE HOMELESSNESS IS THERE. SO IS BASICALLY ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT GOES OUT AND COLLECTS THE DATA THAT SHARES WITH THE STATE. SO THE STATE. DOESN'T GO OUT AND DO ITS OWN SURVEY IN THOSE AREAS AND IN THE POINT IN TIME COUNT DID THEY ADD A COMPONENT -- TO FOCUS ON HOMELESS YOUTH IN -- THE COUNTIES IN GENERAL -- YEAH THE HOME THE POINT TECH OUT THE DONE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THREATEN YOU MOVE CARE IT'S KIND OF LIKE IT'S THE THE REQUIREMENT FOR RECEIVING FEDERAL MCKINNEY VENTO FUNDS. SO THEY ALL DO IT -- I'M NOT INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIFICS OF THE DID THE DATA COLLECTION THAT THEY'RE DOING ON THIS POINT OF TIME COUNTS I WOULD. I DO IMAGINE THAT THEY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING RELATED TO HOMELESS YOUTH PROBABLY SOME QUESTIONS RELATING TO MENTAL ILLNESS AS WELL ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD BE SELF AND WANTED BY INDIVIDUALS OF COURSE -- I HAVE JUST NOT SEEN THAT AGGREGATED IN A WAY THAT I CAN GIVE YOU A STATEWIDE NUMBER AND IS THAT INFORMATION THAT DATA COLLECTED THAT THEN TRANSFERS TO THE LEVEL TO WHERE YOU'RE AT AND THAT'S THE DATA COLLECTED FOR US TO BE ABLE. TO LOOK AT MAKE DECISIONS ON AGAIN THE AND RIGHT NOW THAT THAT IS GENERALLY HELD AT THE COUNTIES HOW DOES THAT GET FOR THE STATE BUT I WAS JUST LOOKING AT IT AS WE WERE TALKING Là. AND THEY IN THEIR HUTS REPORT THEY TALK THEY SPEAK TO THE NUMBER OF CHRONICALLY HOMELESS IT TURNS OUT IT'S THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PERSONS IN CALIFORNIA WERE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS OF THE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMELESS PERSONS. BUT THAT REPORT DOES NOT BREAK IT OUT BY SAID POPULATION SO IT THAT THAT SOME POPULATION IS PROBABLY HOW IS THAT THE COUNTIES. AND IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT ARE ALMOST CORNY FINANCE I THANK IN THIS AND IN RELATION TO THE CHURCH QUESTION AS FAR AS WHO. WHAT WE GET THIS DATA FROM AN WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING IT BACK TO BODIES LIKE THIS? AT THIS POINT I THANK YOU -- THIS VERY VERY GOOD TO DISCUSSION I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IN THE QUESTIONS AND THE RESPONSES. I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME STE. AND I I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE -- I ASKING THAT WE LIMIT OUR TIME OUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES MAXIMUM PLEASE. GREAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M FOR MCDADE TING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT FOR VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME WE PLAYED AN INTRINSIC ROLE IN DEVELOPING THE PROGRAM. AND ENSURING THAT LIKE COUNTIES WERE COMPETING AGAINST LIKE COUNTIES IS ALSO AN 8% SMALL COUNTY SET ASIDE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO ACCESS AND THE FUNDING TO DO MEANINGFUL PROJECTS. AND THEN AS YOU HEARD THE MEDIUM AND LARGE COUNTIES ARE DOING OF GOING LIKE GANG BUSTERS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE FUNDING WE DO STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE TREASURER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT. THE TIMING OF THE FUNDING BUT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE APPLICATIONS RECEIVED ON THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PROPOSAL WERE. EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL WE WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOME FOR PROPOSING IT. AS A MISS CANTWELL INDICATED FIVE CURRENT WHOLE PERSON CARE PROGRAMS -- BUT THOSE PROGRAMS WILL LAPSE WITH THE NEXT MEDICAID WAIVER COURSE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM CONTINUED I THINK MANY COUNTIES ARE EVER COMMITTED TO DOING SO. BUT WE MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS ABOUT HOW OTHER COUNTIES COULD POTENTIALLY ACCESS IS FUNDED SO WE CAN BRING UP MORE WHOLE PERSON CARE PROGRAMS IN THE OTHER COUNTIES. UP BUT WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. KELLY BUT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THAT CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THAT COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ON ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET -- FOR WHOLE PERSON CARE AND WE LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU SUBMITTED MINISTRATION FURTHER. RECOGNITION OF THE SUCCESS OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE AND THE CONTINUING CHALLENGES AROUND HOUSING -- WHOLE PERSON CARE IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT THE BEST WAY TO CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH COMPLEX NEEDS IS TO ADDRESS THEIR MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIO ECONOMIC NEEDS ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

I AM AIR PAIN WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY URBAN INSTITUTE -- AND FRESNO CALIFORNIA AND TO CHAIR RAY AS THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND A REGULATORS WE THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME THE CONVERSATION -- BUT VERY MUCH ALONG THE LINES OF MEMBER TANG -- WE HAVE SOME SOME DEEP CONCERNS -- CENTERED AROUND SOME OF THE DATA -- AT THE LAST THIS COMMITTEE MEETING AT CHAIR BY I'M THAT CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT -- WITH MAXINE WATERS -- SOME OF THE CONCERNS IS IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE PROCESS THE THE STATE WIDE DATA AND LOCALIZE IT -- FROM A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE AFRICAN AMERICANS MAKE UP 40% -- WHICH IS THE DESPERATE -- IMPACT ON HOMELESSNESS WHILE ONLY REPRESENTING 13% OF THE NATIONAL POPULATION -- LATINOS MAKE UP 22%. OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION -- WHICH WOULD TO THE DESPERATE IMPACT OF REPRESENTING ONLY 18% OF THE NATION'S POPULATION -- WHAT ONE FIFTH OF THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OUR CHILDREN -- IN THE IN ALONG THE LINES OF NEARLY THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND VETERANS ARE HOMELESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT I'M IN SO FOR US THIS IS VERY CONCERNING BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE -- TO TAKE SOME OF THESE VERY INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS AT THE REGULATORS ARE IMPLEMENTING -- AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN BEST AT THE LOCAL -- IN SO WITH ANY OTHER COMMENT AND I'M HAPPY DANCE YOU TALK Q.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MASAK OF DATA WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION WE REPRESENT MANY OF THOSE COUNTY OUTREACH WORKERS WHO ARE ENGAGING HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THE STREET SPENDING. WEEKS AND SOMETIMES MONTHS TO GET FOLKS INTO CARE -- WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT IT DOES TAKE BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN WE NEED THE THE HOUSING THE BRICKS AND MORTAR BUT WE ALSO NEED THE SERVICES TO GO ALONG WITH THAT? AND WE WERE PROUD TO HELP TO DEVELOP A WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS AS A CONCEPT UNDER OUR ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER WHICH IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY ALONG WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS IN THE PUBLIC HOSPITALS WE'RE THRILLED BY THE SUCCESS. AND WE THINK THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION FOR I'M PROPOSING TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED MILLION SO THAT WE CAN GO FURTHER IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS INTO HOUSING WE WERE -- CONSTRAINED WITH THE FEDERAL RULES AROUND WHAT WE COULD DO WITH THAT -- BUT I THINK GIVEN THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THIS PILOT IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT REALLY COULD BE BROUGHT TO SCALE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND SO WE WOULD SUPPORT.

FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND THEN -- FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT -- IT CHANGE SO THAT IT WAS ON GOING FUNDING FOR THE FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS MOVING FORWARD -- AND THEN WE WILL PUT THAT INTO A CONTRACT. FOR OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH MOVING FORWARD -- AND SO -- WITH THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT YOU GUYS MIGHT REMEMBER -- THERE WERE TWO THINGS THAT THAT BECAUSE THAT ONE YEAR -- KIND OF A DELAY CONTRACT FIRST SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE FUNDS AND THEN ONCE WE FOUND OUT THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDS THEN IT WAS OUR FIRST CONTRACT WITH -- DE HIRSCH AND SO -- WE NEEDED TO WORK OUT SOME OF THAT CONTRACT DELIVERABLES -- THE THE THE DATA AND THEN ALSO -- THE THE THE DIFFERENT BUDGET ITEMS THE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS YEAH IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE CONTRACTING GUIDELINES SO NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THAT WORKED OUT THIS CONTRAST GOING MUCH SMOOTHER -- AND MOVING FORWARD SO -- SOME OF THE THINGS FOR OUR FOLKS JUST TO BE AWARE OF YOUR PHAM TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SPENDING THE MONEY ON THE CONTRACT INCLUDES -- FUNDING FOR PERSONAL FOR OPERATING EXPENSES AND FOR TRAVEL AND SO FOR PERSONNEL IT'S THINGS LIKE THE DIFFERENT STAFF POSITIONS ON WHICH OTHER CLINICAL OPERATIONS DIRECTORS -- THEIR SENIOR RESEARCH ASSOCIATES PRICES COUNSELORS AND SHIP SUPERVISORS -- FOR OPERATING EXPENSES THOSE INCLUDE ON DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE OCCUPANCY COSTS EQUIPMENT -- INSURANCE AND SUCH AND THEN -- FOR NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE CONFERENCE SO -- SO WE'RE JUST KIND OF PLUGGING ALONG WITH THE FUNDING SO. YEAH THANK YOU. I'M SORRY I'M CONFUSED I I HAD A CONVERSATION ON MY STAFF HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THAT THE THE HARSH PEOPLE THIS MORNING AND EARLIER TODAY AND THAT. THE FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS HAVE NOT BEEN PUT INTO CONTRACT RIGHT SO THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IS WHAT'S IN THE CONTRACT RIGHT NOW THE FOUR POINT THREE MILLION IS WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON WITH THE CONTRACT THAT'S GOING TO BE EXECUTED -- WHICH WILL BE FOR NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR BUT OKAY SO I HAVE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEP IS THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND WHICH ONES ARE IN THE CURRENT CONTRACT CASE OF FOUR POINT -- THREE FOUR SEVENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THEN THE FOUR POINT THREE ONGOING SO THERE IS EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE ENCUMBERED. BY I SPOKE TO THEM AND THERE IS NO PLAN FOR IT SOME. SOME INFORMATION IS NOT CORRECT SO I THINK TO CLARIFY AND IF I MAY THE THE WAY THIS CROP CONTRACT TO SET UP ITS CLAIMS BASED IT'S NOT LIKE A GRANT WILL THAT WHERE THE CONTRACT WAS STEVE ALL THE FUNDS UP FRONT. SO AS THE CONTRACTORS IS SUBMITTING CLAIMS TO THE DEPARTMENT THOSE THOSE COSTS WILL BE REIMBURSED BY THE DEPARTMENT FOR COSTS INCURRED. SO THE EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IS WHAT YOU'RE WORKING OFF OF RIGHT NOW. THEY'VE GOT FROM ONE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CONTRACT RIGHT NOW THAT'S IN THEIR CONTRACT FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR I WAS THE SIXTEEN MONEY THAT'S THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN MONEY AND THEN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN MONEY IS GOING TO BE AND AND JUST LIKE CHRIS WAS SAYING -- THEY'RE INVOICING US FOR THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN OKAY -- BEFORE IT IS THERE THAT THE HARSH FOLKS HERE. SO THAT WE CAN CLARIFY. BECAUSE MY STAFF SPOKE TO THEM WHAT THE WHAT WE WERE TOLD AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CORRECT BECAUSE ARE YOU WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY ARE WORKING WITH A FOUR POINT THREE ONGOING. OF MONEY AND THAT THERE AT THE EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION ARE ENCUMBERED AND NOT BEING ACCESSED YET. WHAT? I MEAN I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT THE EIGHT POINT THREE THAT WAS -- ALLOCATED IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS AVAILABLE FOR BOTH THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN IS UNDER CONTRACT CURRENTLY AND IS AVAILABLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CONTRACTORS UP PROVIDES CLAIMS TO THE DEPARTMENT. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS NOW IN NEGOTIATIONS AND SHOULD BE A WHAT THE CONTRACT SHOULD BE AWARDED SHORTLY. AND THE CONTRACT FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE MONEY IS OBLIGATED IN THE CONTRACT WILL BE WITH TAX RIGHT BY BY THE LAST YEAR WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION WE ACTUALLY HAD A KIND OF AN ARGUMENT ABOUT IT. AND THAT THOSE CALL THE DD HIRSCH WAS SUBMITTING CONTRACTS THAT WERE NOT BEING OUR REIMBURSEMENT THAT WE'RE NOT BEING APPROVED THEY WEREN'T TOO MANY REIMBURSEMENTS YET BECAUSE WE WERE STILL WORKING WITH THEM ON THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATION YES HE THAT'S WHERE WE GOT INTO A BIG OLD DISCUSSION LAST YEAR. EXACTLY AND NOW I WAS TOLD ME AND I WAS TOLD THAT THAT WAS FIXED AND SO NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE ONLY A POINT THREE MILLION FROM SIX OR THE FAR FROM SIXTEEN FROM. SEVENTEEN ARE JUST BEING RIGHT SO EVERYTHING IS LIKE THE WAY THAT ONE YEAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE ONE YEAR FOR THE APPROPRIATION AND THEN WE HAVE THE YEAR THAT WE WERE WORKING WITH THEM ON THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS. AND SO WHAT CHRIS WAS SAYING THE MONEY IS AVAILABLE THE WORK THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING AND NOW WE'RE JUST ABOUT READY TO EXECUTE THE NEXT CONTRACT WITH THEM WHICH WILL HAVE THE FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN IT. AND WE'LL JUST KEEP INVOICING MUST CONTINUOUSLY OKAY SO THAT'S NOT THE INFORMATION THAT I GOT OKAY AND SO WHAT CAN WE USE WHAT I WOULD LIKE YEAH WOULD ELSE A SPECIFIC QUESTION AND I'D LIKE A SPECIFIC ANSWER. BECAUSE IT WAS CONTENTIOUS -- LAST YEAR IN REVIEWING WHAT DID HAPPEN AND I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND IT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED TO THE CELLS ARE REGULARLY MEMBERS SO I WOULD LIKE IT MS REVIEW IF YOU WOULD ASK A SPECIFIC QUESTION AND I WOULD LIKE A SPECIFIC ANSWER TO THE QUESTION YES SO THE HAS THERE ANY MONEY BEEN SPENT THE FOR THE TWENTY SIXTEEN MONEY. TO FOUR MILLION DOLLARS HAVE WE SPENT ANY OF THEM YES WE HAVE SPENT THAT MONEY OKAY SIR THAT'LL WHAT WENT ON TODAY. WHEN YOU SAY WE HAVE SPENT THAT MONEY THEY HAVE INVOICE TO US AND WE HAVE PAID THE INVOICES TO OUR HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW -- I CAN LOOK AND SEE I DO HAVE THAT NUMBER. TO TO TO TO AND YOU ARE RESPONDING. TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR WHAT EXACTLY WHEN THAT WAS WITH A FOUR MILLION DOLLARS I WAS FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. AND I WAS OF FROM JULY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THROUGH JANUARY THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINETEEN THEY WE HAVE PROCESSED INVOICES IN THE A DOLLARS AND FORTY SEVEN CENTS. AND ON MARCH SEVENTH. SO JUST RECENTLY THE HARSHEST SUBMITTED ANOTHER INVOICE TO US IN THE AMOUNT OF 700-830-00600 AND EIGHTY DOLLARS AND EIGHTEEN AND THAT'S STILL THE TWENTY SIXTEEN MONEY AND UP THE TWENTY SIXTEEN MY NAME. AND WE'RE WORKING ON THE CONTRACT WITH THEM RIGHT NOW FOR THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN MONEY WHICH FALLS -- GO INTO EFFECT JULY. ONE TO THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN MONEY THAT FIRST NIGHT OF MY NUMBERS JULY. ONE OKAY. AND THEN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN MONEY THAT WILL BE JULY ONE EXTRA EVERY YEAR IT'S JUST BEEN THE AND THAT'S ANOTHER FOUR POINT THREE THAT'S THREE ABOUT THE ONGOING COST YOU HAVE TO NOT BE THE ONE TIME MONIES RIGHT. ON THE ONE TIME MONIES WERE THAT I THINK THE FIRST TWO YEARS AND THEN THEN IT SWITCHED OVER AN GOING SOMEWHERE WE'VE SPENT. I'M. ROUGHLY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE INVOICE THAT'S FOR IS ONE POINT SEVEN RIGHT AND THE AGAIN TOLL. BUT DISCUSSION MASTER WAS THAT SOME OF THOSE INVOICES WERE BEING HELD UP WE AND WE HAVE ANY INVOICES FROM BY -- LE COURTING LAST TO LAST YEAR WE DID THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT THAT WE HAD ON THE CONTRACT WITH WHAT THE HELL THAT THERE WAS NO CONTRACT IN PLACE THAT WAS THE BIG HOLD HOLD OUT BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE CONTRACT WITH THEM. AND THE STICKING POINTS WERE THE THINGS LIKE THEY WERE WANTING TO BUY THE BACKUP GENERATOR AND RIGHT THAT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT FOR THE SYSTEM WELL WE CAN'T THOSE ARE ON ALLOWABLE COSTS FOR THE STATE AND BY -- DECIDES THE THE ALLOWABLE THE ALLOW ABILITY OF THOSE YEAH AND SO ONCE WE WORKED ALL THAT OUT AND AND AND I THINK PART OF IT WAS THE DATA AS WELL SO IT WAS JUST THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AND SO OKAY SO LET ME BACK UP. SO ARE THE ALLOWED TO PURCHASE GENERATORS NOW NO YOU CAN'T WITH THAT'S JUST STATE CONTRACTING GUIDELINES WE CAN'T DO THAT. OKAY SO WHO CREATED GUIDELINES THE I THINK THERE WAS NEW FOR THEM YOU KNOW CONTRACTING DIRECTLY THROUGH THE STATE PRIOR TO CONTRACTING DIRECTLY WITH US BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW FUNDING SOURCE FOR THEM. THEY HAD WORKED THROUGH CAL ME SO WHICH IS THE JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY THAT THE COUNTY SAID ON SO THE CONTRACTING RULES WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE USING THE COUNTY DOLLARS VERSUS THE STATE DOLLARS AND SO -- IF I THINK IT'S JUST A LEARNING CURVE FOR EVERYBODY OKAY SOULS WELL. I BEG TO DIFFER ON THAT BY -- SO THEN. SINCE IT'S SINCE WE HAVE ONGOING MONEY NOW CAN THEY PURCHASE OR IS A CONTRACT THE SAME CAN BE PURCHASED ANY -- BACKUP GENERATORS FOR EXAMPLE CAN THE EXPANDER SERVICES TO RURAL COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S SERVICES YEAH SO ALL THOSE THINGS THAT I JUST MENTIONED LIKE THE THAT PERSONAL OF OPERATING EXPENSES YOU KNOW ALLOWABLE OPERATING EXPENSES AS LONG AS IT'S WITHIN -- YOU KNOW THE RULES OF STATE CONTRACTING GUIDELINES THE TRAVEL ALL THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE NEGOTIATED WITH THEM ON AND THAT WE'VE ALL AGREED ON THEY CAN KEEP DOING THAT. SO IS THERE A WAY -- TO ALLOW THE THE THE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT THAT THEY WANT I KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T ASKED FOR ANYTHING I HAVEN'T HEARD THEY DON'T THEY DON'T ASK BECAUSE I TOLD THEM NO THE YEAH SO NONE OF THAT STUFF IS CHANGED ABOUT MY POINT QUE. YOU CAN'T BUT CAN WE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED THOSE EXPENSES BECAUSE I KNOW THEY NEED THOSE EXCITING HOUSING ACTING EXPERT BY I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THAT WOULD WORK I MEAN WE JUST WHAT OPERATE WITHIN OUR STATE CONTRACTING GUIDELINES SO. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A WHOLE DIFFERENT PROCESS I DON'T KNOW PERCENT RIGHT WITH THAT'S MY POINT BECAUSE THIS MONEY WAS DESIGNED TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR SYSTEMS YEAH IT'S WE'VE ONLY SPENT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION OF EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION WELL THEY HAVE THE THE MONEY I MEAN. RIGHT NOW IN THE CONTRACT THEY HAVE FOR ME MILLION OF THE FOUR MILLION THAT'S A LOT OF TO THEM RIGHT BUT WE GET BACK TO LAST YEAR'S DISCUSSION THE ONLY REASON THEY THEY SPENT THAT MONEY WAS WITH WE WERE AND ALLOWING THEM TO SPEND MORE. DOUG BAILEY THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATION WAS STALLING BECAUSE OF YOU GUYS AND SOUL THAT'S MY POINT SO IF WE DIDN'T ALLOW THEM. TO SUBMIT ANY OF THOSE CHARGES BECAUSE YOU WERE IN CONTRACT DISPUTE OR CAN'T CONTACT NEGOTIATIONS THEN. THEY'RE NOT THERE WERE NOT BEING ALLOWED TO SPEND THAT MONEY SO WELL THAT WASFROM THE PRINT PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR AND SO I THINK AS OF JULY ONE WE HAD A CONTRACT IN PLACE WITH THEM THAT HAD ALL THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. OUTLINED IN IT AND THAT WAS WHAT WAS AGREED UPON WITH EVERYBODY AND PRIMARILY IS TO ANSWER THE PHONE CALLS LIKE TO TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER PHONE CALLS SUPPORT THE STAFFING TO BE ABLE -- TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED CALL VOLUME THAT WAS THE BIGGEST CONCERN THAT DV HERS HAD WAS BECAUSE SINCE --% THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE WAS BEING ADVERTISED ON THROUGH CAL ME SO SO MANY OF OUR YOU KNOW PUBLIC CAMPAIGNS THEY WERE SEEING INCREASES IN CALL VOLUME AND THE CAL MESA FUNDING THAT WAS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME HAD GONE AWAY AND SO THEY NEEDED TO HAVE A SUSTAINED FUNDING. SOURCE TO BE ABLE TO MEET THOSE CALL SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE USING THE FUNDING FOR IS FOR THE STAFFING TO ANSWER THE CALLS IS IT. POSSIBLE TO GET A COPY OF THE CONTRACT AND WHAT THE BIBLE PLEASE. THANK YOU YEAH [inaudible] RAMOS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN ON SOME OF THE THE THE PRESENTATION THE BACK OF DATA THAT WE HAVE. THE SHOWS -- IN THE AGE GROUPS OF TEN TO FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS -- AREAS -- THERE WHAT IS SOME OF THE ONGOING -- PLANS OR OR LONG TERM APPROACH TO START TO LOOK AT THAT HIGH PERCENTAGE -- THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS IN IN ELEMENTARY -- SCHOOLS NOW YOUNG AGES -- AND THE K. THROUGH TWELVE YOU SEEN. ELEMENTS OF BULLYING SOCIAL BALLING USING SOCIAL MEDIA IS SEEN YOUNG PEOPLE TAKING THEIR LIVES AND TO SEE THIS -- THAT NOW THERE'S A A PLAN OR OR SOME TYPE OF DIALOGUE GOING ON TO START TO IDENTIFY HOW TO WORK WITH THE RESOURCES ARE THERE. CAN YOU IDENTIFY WHAT STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN ARE STEPS THAT -- ARE PROJECTED TO BE TAKEN IN THE FUTURE I MEAN I THINK I COULD DO A LITTLE BIT MAYBE TOBY THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD SEGUE YOUNG MAYBE TO THE ARMS THE THE THE PLAN BUT THE LARGER STRATEGIC PLAN BUT I'M JUST IN TERMS OF THE CONTRACT THAT WE HAVE. WITH DIDI HIRSCH -- THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS AGE GROUPS SO IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WITH THE YOUNGER KIDS THAT BEING ONLINE MORE TEXTING THEY'D HAVE DIFFERENT -- DIFFERENT AVENUES TO GET THAT -- TO TO TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT OF YOU KNOW CONTACTS FROM KIDS -- I THINK ALSO THERE WAS A BILL LAST YEAR THAT PUT IT ON ICE STUDENT ID CARDS TO BE ABLE TO CONTACT THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE I KNOW AS A DEPARTMENT. WE'RE DEFINITELY ADVOCATING FOR THE CONTINUED USE OF THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A STANDARDIZED NUMBER AND IT GOES TO THE NATIONAL LINE AND THEY WILL TAKE IN THE ENTRANCE FOR THE CALLS LOCALLY TO OUR AREA AND AND AND AGAIN LIKE I SAID THE ALSO DO THE THAT. THE TEXT MESSAGING AS WELL AND CHAT WITH THE CHILD AS WELL AS FAR AS OF EARLY ON PREVENTION I MEAN ONCE YOU GET TO THE THE SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE NUMBER THERE'S ALREADY THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING YEAH. SO WHAT ABOUT IN THE EARLY STAGES OF IT -- WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT COULD BE GOING THROUGH THAT OR SOMEONE THAT MY SEE DIFFERENT SIGNS IN THE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S THAT'S GOING THROUGH THIS? SO I THINK AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE READY TO MOVE ON TO A QUITE YET BUT BUT I THINK THAT THE THE QUESTION BECAUSE I YOUR CONTRACT FOR THE A SUICIDE BOMB. PREVENTION LIFELINES BUT YEAH THAT THAT LARGER PLAN FOR WHAT YOU DO FOR PREVENTION UP FRONT -- THAT'D BE MORE THE STRATEGIC PLAN. I I DID THE MISTER TING. THEY AT THE COMMAND JUST JUST JUST TO CLARIFY THIS ONE THANK MISS MISS RUBIO FOR FOLLOWING UP ON THAT -- ISSUE FROM LAST YEAR SO THE THERE IS NO PREVIOUS MONEY FROM THE FOUR MILLION FROM. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN RIGHT SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT IT WAS ALLOCATED FROM THAT -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT HAPPENED FUNDS IS THERE A REASON WHY -- THERE'S BEEN SO LITTLE THAT'S BEEN INVOICE AT THIS POINT. I WERE FOLLOWING UP RIGHT NOW TO FIND OUT WHAT WHAT WHY IT'S ABOUT NOT QUITE THREE QUARTERS THAT THEY'VE INVOICE AT THIS POINT SO YEAH WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING TO FIND OUT WHY I'M. OKAY WHY I'M NOT COUNT LESS THAN HALF. OF THE MILLION MY MATH IS WRONG ON THAT ONE THEN -- THEN. GO GOING GOING BACK -- TO THIS IS THE REASON WHY THE% TEN INVOICE TYPE OF CONTRACT USUALLY IT'S GRANTING USUALLY THAT THE GRANTS ARE RELEASED AS A REASON WHY THE FIGHT ON THIS ONE WELL I THINK IN ORDER FOR THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO CONTRACT WITH A VENDOR WE HAVE TO HAVE. LIKE DELIVERABLES AND WE HAVE TO WE'RE PURCHASING SERVICES SO. IT'S NOT A PASSED THROUGH A GUY WE CAN'T SET IT UP AS A PASS THROUGH IT. IT'S JUST. BUT THE BUT THAT'S EIGHT EIGHT IS A REASON WHY IT'S NOT A GRANT. WHAT I MEAN I THINK IT WAS ALLOCATED FOR TO PURCHASE IT TOO TO CONTRACT WITH THE VENDORS SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE A SPECIFIC SERVICE WHICH WAS TO ANSWER THE PHONE CALLS? AND SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S HOW THE CONTRACT IS SET UP IS FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE PHONE CALLS. RABBITS FOR OUR METHODOLOGY HE WAY IT'S SET UP IT'S NOT IT YOU USUALLY. IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S SOME. AND IT'S SORT OF UNUSED AND UNUSUAL TO DO SORT OF A FEE FOR SERVICE MODEL THAT IS NOT SORT OF TYPICAL FOR ALL ALL YOU AND YOUR GRANTEES. I MEAN YEAH I I MEAN CHRIS THEY'RE IN PLACE WITH THE STATE I I KNOW I DO KNOW HOWEVER THERE THERE ARE THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON. FOR CONTRACTS TO BE SET UP CURRENTLY LIKE THIS I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ALLOCATIONS THAT USUALLY GO OUT. LIKE TO OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES SUCH AS LIKE COUNTIES AND AND YOU KNOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUT WITH SPECIFIC CONTRACTORS THEY'RE USUALLY -- CLAIMS BASS FROM MY UNDERSTANDING I'M OR AND LIKE LIBERAL SO YOU'RE WE'RE CONTRACTING FOR SPECIFIC SERVICE AND NOT VENDOR PROVIDES THE SERVICE TO THE STATE AND WE ARE DOING OVERSIGHT ON THAT CONTRACT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE BEING -- PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT CONTRACT. RIGHT RIGHT BUT I MEAN IN OTHER IN OTHER AREAS YOU END UP -- PROVIDING YOU TO SIGN A CONTRACT. YOU YOU WOULD GIVE THEM THE ALLOCATED FUNDING BASED ON AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO X. Y. Z. AMOUNT OF PARK [inaudible] SO -- DID TO ME AND AGAIN I'M ONLY THAT THE CHAIR THE BUDGETS ONLY SEE WITHIN THE BUDGET. SO TO ME THAT THAT'S NOT A COMMON PRACTICE. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY WHY I'M SORRY I THOUGHT WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITE LIKE WITH. YOUR THING IN THE CHURCH TO YOUR SINK IN YOUR DEPARTMENT. THIS IS THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE CONTRACT THAT I'VE HAD I'VE MANAGED -- LIKE I WITH THIS. CONTRACT THAT I'VE I'VE ME ON ON US IN THIS THE ONLY CONTRACT THAT'S MEASURES WAY IT'S JUST I'M JUST THINK IT'S JUST. THE WHAT DID THERE MY MY EXPERIENCE WITH THESE THEY'RE NOT SITE USUAL TO BE DOING IT THIS WAY. SO YOU'RE SAYING WITH THE CONTRACT HE MANAGE WITHIN WITHIN SORT OF HELP LIKE YOU KNOW WITHIN. MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE SO THAT'S THAT'S THE TYPICAL YEAH YEAH SO -- YOU KNOW USUALLY IT'S IT'S DELIVERABLES BAYS ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE SO WITH SO WE'RE GETTING INVOICED FOR WHATEVER PRODUCT OR DELIVERABLE THAT THAT THE COMMANDER HAS PRODUCED AND THEN WE WILL RECEIVE THAT TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND YOU KNOW VERIFY IT AND THEN. APPROVED THE CONTRACT OF THE INVOICE TO BE PAID. I THINK ARE ARE CONCERNED CONCERN HAS BEEN OBVIOUSLY THIS FUNDING WAS APPROVED -- YOU'RE NOT NUMBER YEARS AGO IT'S CLEARLY THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NEED BASED ON ALL THE ALL THE DATA. THE SLOW NESS OF THE MONEY GETTING MOVED. TO PROVIDE SERVICES WHICH IS ALL TO THE GOOD THE GOAL WITH AND TO HAVE THE MONEY SIT IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IT WAS. TO TO REALLY SIT AND DO SERVICES SO ON THE CONCERN IS IS IS THE DEPARTMENT SORT OF HINDERING OR BEING A STOP GAP IN HAVING THOSE RESOURCES. AND GO TO PROVIDE CRITICAL ON THE GROUND SERVICES I MEAN I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE VENDOR I MEAN WE'VE SET THE CONTRACT UP THE AGREED TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WE'VE BEEN GETTING THE CALL VOLUME DATA FROM THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT AND SO AND THEY'VE. BEEN AND INVOICING BASED ON THE WORKTHAT THEY PERFORMED IN THE CONTRACT SO THERE'S NOTHING TO REALLY INDICATE. THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING WHAT THEY NEED I WOULD THINK THAT IF THEY HAD PROVIDED THE SERVICE THEY WOULD INVOICE FOR EXCEPT I'M SORRY I HAVE TO JUMP IN EXCEPT FOR THE THE THE DISCUSSION WE HAD LAST YEAR WHEN WHEN THE DEPARTMENT WAS HOLDING UP ALL OF THOSE CONTRACTS. WE HAVE THIS ARGUMENT LAST YEAR ABOUT THE THE THE INVOICE IS BEING HELD UP AND SOUL BATH FOR ME A MISTER TING -- THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING IS THAT THE CONTRACT WAS BEING HELD UP THE INVOICES WERE BEING -- HELD UP SOUL THE FACT THAT THE MONEY IS NOT BEING SPENT IS IN MY OPINION NOT NECESSARILY THE THE THAT DVD HURSTON AND INVOICES THAT YOU GUYS ARE HOLDING IT UP. AND SOLD I'M. WE HAD THIS FIGHT LAST YEAR OUR DISCUSSION LAST YEAR AND I WAS TOLD THEM THAT THIS WAS GOING TO CHANGE AND THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE. TO TO PROVIDE THAT FUNDING MYCOMMENT SPECIFICALLY WAS WHILE WE'RE HOLDING THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE DYING AND SOUL FOR FOR US TO SAY OR WOOD STEVIE HERS IT REALLY ISN'T THE HARSH. I THINK AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING HOW WE CAN FIX IT SO THAT THEY CAN GET MORE FUNDING TO PROVIDE MORE SERVICES RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE NOT GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED -- BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS EQUIPMENT -- IS IS NOT BEING PROVIDED I KNOW YOU JUST SAID THAT EQUIPMENT IS NOT ALLOWABLE BUT ALSO WE DON'T HAVE -- AT BILINGUAL OF SERVICES OR TWENTY FOUR HOUR. SERVICES IN SPANISH WHICH ARE NEEDED AND SOUL MY CONCERN IS THAT WHILE WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION THERE'S FOLKS THAT NEED OUR HELP AND WE'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT HELP SO THEY HAVE. THAT THEY STILL HAVE THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS IN PLAY RIGHT NOW IN THE CONTRACT AND THEY HAVEN'T INVOICE FOR ALL OF THAT AND AND I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING THAT. THE CONTRACT WAS IN PLACE BUT THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE JULY ONE SO THEY'RE ABLE TO INVOICES NOW WHEN AS AS THEY NEED TO FOR THE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING. TODAY WE RECEIVED THAT ONE POINT SO CAN SUBMIT US THE CEMENT ADDITIONAL INVOICES TO US FOR THAT AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE SAYING WHERE YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE. THE SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN RURAL AREAS THAT IS WHAT WERE IF THAT'S BETTER EXPECTATIONS THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THIS WITH THE FUNDING THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING SO. THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSES AND THERE'S A THERE'S MORE MONEY RIGHT ON THE HEELS OF IT SO COME JULY ONE THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO KEEP SUBMITTING INVOICES TO US THEREAFTER FOR ALL THE WORK THAT THEY'RE GONNA KEEP DOING FOR US THROUGH WOULD HAVE TO SAY IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IS YOU'RE LIMITING THEIR CAPACITY BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY BILLING AND YOU'RE HOLDING THEIR MONEY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THEY MAY ONLY HAVE SO MANY RESOURCES. BUT IT'S A GRAM MAYES BASED MODEL THIS IS TIME AND MATERIALS WILL BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE A YOU'RE PAYING THEM. OKAY THEY PROVIDE A SERVICE AND YOU PAN. YOUR YOU IN THAT MODEL YOU'RE ACTUALLY -- IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CONTINUE TO PAY THEIR THEIR EXPENSES KEPT AWAY FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE. TO ACTUALLY ARE LIMITING THEIR ABILITY FOR CAPACITY TO GET OUT THERE IN THIS MODEL. IS WHAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING. THE MODEL NEEDS TO CHANGE WERE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESOURCE ALL OF THE MONEY TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. THE YOU MANAGE IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT NOT DOLING OUT INCOME INCREMENTAL MONIES. BECAUSE THEY CAN ONLY CARRY SO MUCH AT A TIME. THAT'S LIMITING CAPACITY SO -- SO SO PRIOR TO JULY FIRST COULD THEY HAVE INVOICE YOU PARTED OUR FIRST THEY HAD TO HAVE HAD A CONTRACT IN PLACE WHICH IS WHAT WHAT THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS HAD BEEN LAST YEAR AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR. AND MR TING JUST FOR CONTEXT THAT WAS THE THE THE ARGUMENT LAST YEAR THEY WERE HOLDING UP THE CONTRACT AND IT WAS BEING HELD FOR ABOUT ALMOST A YEAR. AND THAT'S WHERE WE GOT INTO THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION. IN IN I THINK ON IT WILL WILL BOTH FOLLOW UP WITH THE CONTRACTOR AS WELL AS IF YOU COULD JUST TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND. IS THERE ARE THERE OTHER BARRIERS TO THERE ARE EXPANDING THEIR PARTICULAR MODEL -- WHICH WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MOVE YOU KNOW MOVE THE MONEY THAT'S BEEN APPROPRIATE FOR THIS% PURPOSE. AND GET IT TO THE RIGHT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND NOTHING'S COME UP TO US TO HEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN A BARRIER SO IF YOU GUYS ARE HEARING THAT I MEAN I THINK WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] DOCTOR WOULD. AND I AND I DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY ON THIS SO SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONTRACTOR OR THE OR THE THEY THEY WANTED -- BACKUP GENERATORS I GUESS AND THAT'S NOT ALLOWED BY DE TGS SO THEY MUST HAVE HAD A REASON FOR WANTING THOSE OBVIOUSLY. PROBABLY AREAS WERE POWER GOES OUT IMAGE IMAGINE THAT. FIVE WIRES I THINK THAT -- SO. WELL IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT THERE THERE IS NO ABILITY TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE IS OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY LEASE. IS THAT A D. G. S. -- IMPEDIMENT COULD THEY NOT LEAST THAT EQUIPMENT SO THEY COULD PROVIDE THE SERVICE AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S AVAILABLE I MEAN WE COULD EXPLORE THAT THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT I THAT I KNEW OF THAT THEY ASKED TO DO BY -- BUT BUT I WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM AND I GUESS FOR PART OF IT IS THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION AND SUB I'M SORRY I'M NOT A GENIUS BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN'T BUY SOMETHING SOMETIMES YOU CAN RENT IT ARE YOU CAN ONLY SET. SO IS I JUST WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS I MEAN THEY HAVE ASKED FOR ANY OF US I ONCE WE HADN'T. BEEN BUT THEY DID ASK FOR THIS JOB AT ONE POINT AND DIDN'T ASK AGAIN SO SO I'M JUST SAYING IS THERE ANOTHER IS THEIR WORK AROUND. KNOWING THAT TGS HAS THIS POLICY CAMPFIRE. SO COULD YOU LET US KNOW ABOUT THAT. OKAY THANK YOU I THINK IT'S CLEAR FROM THE THE QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS THAT. THERE IS GREAT FRUSTRATION IN THIS REGARD. AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR TO ME AS A NEW MEMBER HERE THAT. WHAT IS BEING SAID AND WHAT IS BEING DONE DON'T NECESSARILY MATCH? THAT'S A SERIOUS CONCERN FOR ME IS IS THE ACTING CHAIR. I THINK THAT -- IF WE KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE. AND THIRDS DISCUSSIONS WITH SOMEONE AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A BREAKDOWN. IN IN THIS CONTRACT THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS BUT AS A MISTER FRAZIER NOTED. WHILE THIS IS GOING ON SUICIDES CONTINUE. TO INCREASE PEOPLE ARE DYING AS A RESULT OF THIS. IF IF THERE WERE OTHERS THAT WE WERE NEGOTIATING WITH I THINK THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT BUT IF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE WITH THE ONE PARTICULAR VENDOR. AND THE SERVICES HAVE TO BE PROVIDED THAT IS OF GREAT CONCERN. AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEN WE ARE FAILING. AND THAT'S WHY WE LOOK TO YOU FOR THE ANSWERS IF IT'S SOMEONE ELSE WE NEED TO LOOK TO YOU TELL US WHO WE NEED TO ASK. BECAUSE THE ANSWERS DO HAVE TO BE PROVIDED IN IN IN A WAY THAT. THAT WILL ALLEVIATE THE CONCERNS IT'S CLEAR TO ME. THE CONCERN STILL EXISTS I DON'T BELIEVE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO OR SIMPLY MEMBER TING. RECEIVED. AN ANSWER -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IS PUT IN SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS THERE WAS A NEED THAT WAS RECOGNIZED FOR A SUICIDE HOTLINE. AND WERE THERE NEGOTIATIONS WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN DIDI HIRSCH. THE IDEA WAS FOR IT WAS ALL THE SUICIDE HOTLINES HEAD COMMON AND WRITTEN A LETTER TO US SAYING THAT THEIR PREFERENCE WAS TO HAVE EVERYTHING CONTRACTED THROUGH DIDI HIRSCH AND INDEED THE HEARSE WITH SUB THAT THE FUNDING OUT TO THEM. SO IT IN ORDER TO FULFILL THAT THE THE INTENT. OF THE LEGISLATURE IN OF THE GOVERNOR -- THEN IT WAS TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE OF SUICIDE HOTLINE A SUICIDE HOTLINE. AND IT SEEMS IN FROM YOUR ANSWER THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE THROUGH DIDI HIRSCH. END OF YET SPEND FOR FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. THERE WAS NOTHING IN PLACE -- AND WHETHER THE BREAKDOWN IS WITH DD HER SURE THE BREAKDOWN IS WITH THE STATE. IT IS THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE LOSING OUT ON THAT. AND I THINK THAT -- FROM THE QUESTIONS FROM MS RUBIO. IT IT IT AYE AYE IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT IT WAS THE STATE. THAT WAS NOT MOVING THE CONTRACTUAL NEGOTIATIONS. AT A PACE THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE MOST AT RISK. WHO IS IT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT FOR THAT NEGOTIATION ON BEHALF OF THE STATE? MY TEAM WOULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT NEGOTIATION AND WE WE WERE AND WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE TEAM I'M IN CHARGE OF THE TEAM. SO WOULD YOU BE THE ONE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE THEN FOR DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT A CONTRACT IS ENTERED INTO. WELL I THINK I'M RESPONSIBLE YEAH I THINK I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. ALL RIGHT. THERE THERE WAS. EIGHT QUESTION JUST. LESS THAN A WEEK AGO REGARDING THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE EIGHT POINT. EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION -- AND IT SEEMS THAT THERE WEREN'T A WHOLE LOT OF ANSWERS. FROM EITHER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BUT TODAY WE KNOW FOR SURE. WHERE THE EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION IS? YEAH OUT THERE THAT THE ALLOCATION IS SET UP TO BE AN CONTRACTS FROM EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS IT ACCURATE THE DIDI HIRSCH. CAN INVOICE DH CS FOR THE EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION IN FUNDING THERE WAS APPROPRIATED TO DH CS THROUGH THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUDGETS. THEY CAN APPROPRIATE OR THEY CAN -- INVOICE FOR THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S IN THE CONTRACT NOW AND THEN ON GOING THROUGH. THE CONTRACT IT'LL BE EXECUTED AS OF JULY. ONE TWENTY NINETEEN ARE YOU WHICH LOCATIONS FOR NEW CONTRACT YES AND WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO TO GIVE YOU THAT CONTRACT IS THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE NEW CONTRACT AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER I'M NOT THAT I WHERE I THINK WE'RE JUST CONTINUING ON WITH THE SAME. CONTRACT BECAUSE AND IF YOU ARE CONTINUING ON WITH THE SAME CONTRACT WHAT IS THE REASON THAT THERE IS A HOLD UP. OR DELAY IN SIGNING THE NEW CONTRACT THERE'S NOT ON THE WAY OR HOLD UP IN SIGNING A NEW CONCERT GOING ABOUT GOING BACK pI'M SORRY I DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW A FEW THINGS GOING BACK TO MY QUESTION. CAN THEY INVOICE THEM FOR UP TO THE EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION. AS OF JULY ONE TWENTY THE BECAUSE THE NEW CONTRACT THEY WERE GONNA SIGN. GOES INTO EFFECT JULY ONE TWENTY NINE SO THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO INVOICE FOR THAT ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT THREE MILLION FROM JULY ONE TWENTY NINETEEN THROUGH JUNE. THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY ARE THE BILLING FOR SERVICES OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ARM I DON'T THINK THEY'RE BACK BILLING I THINK THEIR BILLING FOR STARTING THIS YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD. AND ACTUALLY THE THE ORIGINAL FUNDING THAT WAS I'M I'M PUT IN WAS THAT IT WILL THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL FUNDING THAT WASN'T AVAILABLE TO ALL SPRING OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN I BELIEVE. FOR MORE SEVEN ONE EIGHTEEN THROUGH ONE THIRTY ONE NINETEEN YOU SAY THEY HAVE INVOICE NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND PLUS. YES AND THAT'S BEEN PAID YES. YEAH AND YOU NOW HAVE A NEW INVOICE FOR SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE THAT IS BEING PROCESSED OR WHAT IT WHAT IT WAS WE JUST RECEIVED ON MARCH SEVENTH. AND WHAT IS WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR GETTING THAT OFF RIGHT IT WILL JUST REVIEW THE DELIVERABLES AND SIGN OFF ON THE INVOICE AND SENATOR COUNTY DEPARTMENT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE A DD HIRSCH'S FOR EXACTLY. THREE MILLION. THAT'S ACCURATE HOW CAN DIDI HIRSCH INVOICE FOR THE ADDITIONAL EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION. WAIT FOR THE THEY CAN AND THEY CAN INVOICE UP TO THE BUDGET THEY HAD A FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED THEY PUT THEY GAVE US A BUDGET FOR THE THREE POINT NINE MILLION. AND THEN FOR THE ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT THREE MILLION THAT IS GOING TO GO INTO THE CONTRACT AS OF JULY. ONE TWENTY NINETEEN THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE INVOICING US FOR IT. I'M SORRY I'M I'M. I THE MATH SEEMS TO BE OFF TO ME SO I TWENTY SIXTEEN FOUR POINT THREE THAT WENT INTO EFFECT TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR MILLION. FOUR MILLION. AND THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOUR POINT THREE MILLION. TO GOING TO AFFECT IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEN FOUR POINT THREE MILLION TO GOING TO AFFECT TWENTY NINETEEN THERE IS THE IS THE FOUR MILLION WHICH WENT INTO A A CONTRACT THAT WAS FOR A TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WILL KNOW BECAUSE THE TWENTY SIX YOU TOLD ME THAT TWENTY SIXTEEN MONEY GOES INTO EFFECT ON JULY. FIRST OF TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT WENT INTO A ACT UNTIL JULY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NUMBER THAT WAS THE WHOLE RIGHT BUT I TRY TO GRADUATION BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FOLLOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A POINT THREE AND I'M. I'M THINKING IT'S TWELVE POINT SIX NOW IT'S WHAT POINT SO FOR EACH. YES OF FOUR FOUR MILLION THEY WENT TO AFFECT AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOUR POINT THREE THE WENT INTO EFFECT IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN RIGHT TWENTY EIGHTEEN YEP AND THEN FOUR POINT THREE THAT'S GOING TO GOING TO AFFECT AND TWENTY NINETEEN SOLD. I'M MISSING THE BOAT FOUR POINT THREE SO THEN THAT THAT THIRD FOUR POINT THREE GOES INTO EFFECT INTO A CONTRACT THAT WOULD BE. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND NOW IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. SO IT'S FOUR THREE REMOTELY BREAK THIS DOWN FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WAS FOUR MILLION FOUR MILLION. AND NOT EVEN ENTER INTO A CONTRACT UNTIL TWO YEARS LATER JULY ONE OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YOU GOT. WHY ARE WE TWO YEARS BEHIND SO THE FIRST YEAR WAS TO FIND OUT IF THE FUNDING WAS AVAILABLE BECAUSE THAT FUNDING FOR THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WAS SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH CAME INTO A PLAY WOOD WHEN WE FOUND OUT THAT THE? MONEY WAS THERE IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WHY DOES IT TO THE EXTENT. MAY I ASK OF COURSE HOW IS IT THE SO IN YEARS PAST WITH FUNDS WITH AND WITH FUNDS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY OF THE REVENUE THAT ARE RECEIVED IN THAT PARTICULAR FINE BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON PERSONAL INCOME TAX. PERSONAL INCOME TAX ISN'T RECONCILED UNTIL. MARCH OF THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR SO FOR EXAMPLE AS OF RIGHT NOW WE JUST FINISHED RECKONED WERE IN AF FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE JUST FINISHED RECONCILING. TAX YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN REVENUE WASN'T FINALIZED UNTIL JUST THIS MONTH. AND SO. AS I NOTED AT WITH YEARS PRIOR WITH THAT FUNDS ALLOCATED OUT OF THIS FUNDING YEARS PAST AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR THOSE AUGMENTATIONS. FINANCE HAS ADDED A BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT SPECIFIES THAT FOR THOSE FUNDING AUGMENTATIONS WERE AVAILABLE AND TELL THE FINAL. UNTIL THE REVENUES WERE FINAL. FOR THE YEARS PAST AND SO FOR THIS PARTICULAR AUGMENTATION THOSE FUNDS WERE AVAILABLE UNTIL MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND YET THERE WASN'T A CONTRACT UNTIL JULY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE THE CONTRACT WAS -- ENACTED IN JULY CRAP I WON TWENTY EIGHTEEN YES THAT'S CORRECT STILL A YEAR. ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER YOU FOUND WHERE THE MONEY WAS IN THAT WE HAD THE MONEY. AND STILL TOOK OVER. OVER A YEAR HERE THAT'S A NOT ALL OF THEM THAT'S A PROBLEM AND I I UNDERSTAND. MS REVIEWS -- CONCERN. OF THE DH CS HAS STATED THE DIDI HIRSCH CANNOT READ BE REIMBURSED FOR CAPITAL COSTS. DOES THIS INCLUDE UP A DOES THIS AND I DON'T KNOW IF EVEN ASKED FOR I. T. UPGRADES. I'M NOT ASKING IF SHE YEAH I'M JUST ASKING I MEAN I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK TO SEE BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT A DOCTOR SO DID YES CONTRACTING EXPERTS SO I WOULD. I I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT WE DO DO OPERATING EXPENSES AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE I TO COSTS WOULD FALL UNDER OPERATING EXPENSES SEEM LIKE IT WOULD BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SIT. WHO IS WITHIN YOUR DEPARTMENT THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BEING I WOULD CONSULT WITH OUR CONTRACTS -- FOLKS WHO WHO KNOW THAT. ONE I'VE -- I MORE CONTRACTS TEAM YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE STE CONTRACT ANALYSTS WHO WORK WITH MY TEAM MEMBERS AND THEY USUALLY WORK OUT ALL OF THE DETAILS TO KNOW WHAT'S THE WHAT'S OF IT WHAT'S APPROPRIATE AND WHAT'S NOT. WHAT I THINK SO WHAT WE WANT IS WE WE WE? WORK THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT AS IT THAT. SOMEBODY WHO'S JUST COMING HERE. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ANSWERS AND THE WAY THE ANSWERS ARE BEING GIVEN. I'M VERY CONCERNED. AND I THINK THAT THAT MAYES RUBIO AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE DESERVES TO HAVE MORE -- DIRECT ANSWERS AND I THINK THAT IT ISN'T AS THOUGH IT'S AN ISSUE THAT JUST CAME UP TODAY. THIS GOES BACK TO A YEAR AGO WHERE IT WAS VERY VERY CLEAR THAT THERE WAS A THERE WAS SOMETHING HAPPENING THE SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING. AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE QUESTIONS ASKED BY BY OUR TEAM BY THE CONSULTANTS ANSWERS ARE GIVEN A PARTICULAR WAY AND YET WE HEAR SOMETHING DIFFERENT TODAY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO L. STE THE THE CONTRACTOR THE VENDOR AND WAS GIVEN SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AT IT THAT'S THAT'S OF GREAT CONCERN -- PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY I. T. UPGRADES ARE YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT SURE IF I. T. UPGRADES CAN BE INCLUDED. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAY I'M NOT QUITE SURE I MEAN I WOULD HAVE TO CONSULT WITH OUR TEAM IN OUR CONTRACTING EXPERTS TO TO FIND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS YOU KNOW IS THERE SOMETHING THAT. BECAUSE I'VE AS FAR AS I WAS AWARE EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN PUT IN THE CONTRACT WAS AGREED UPON AND EVERYBODY'S GETTING WHAT THEY NEED EVERYTHING WAS PUT IN PLACE AS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PUT IN PLACE RIGHT SIDE BUT THE THE DISCUSSION LAST YEAR WAS THAT YOU GUYS WERE. PREVENTING SOME OF THESE ISSUES TO GO AND GET ON THECONTRACT IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT'S THE THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR AND THAT'S WHY WE HAD THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION. SO IF I'M THE VENDOR AND YOU'RE PREVENTING ME FROM ADDING CERTAIN ISSUES ON TO THE CONTRACT THEN OF COURSE THE CONTRACT IS NOT GOING TO BE. WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY AND THAT WAS THE PREVENTION OF THE SOME OF THESE ITEMS TO GET ON THE CONTRACT THAT WAS THE BATTLE OVER THE CONTRACT LAST YEAR? AND WE OUT AND I SPECIFICALLY ASKED -- WHAT WERE THE ISSUES AND I WAS GIVIN GIVIN UP NOT GOOD INFORMATION LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RADIUS IS TALKING ABOUT NOW THEY WERE ASKING THESE YOU'RE SAYING THAT BILLS THAT THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR THOSE ISSUES TO BE PUT ON THE CONTRACT? BUT LAST YEAR YOU GUYS WERE PREVENTING THEM FROM PUTTING ANYTHING ON THE CONTRACT WHEN I THOUGHT WE RESOLVE THAT. I THOUGHT WE RESOLVED EVERYTHING TO AND I THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW ONCE WE CAME TO AGREEMENT EVERYTHING WAS RESOLVED THE CONTRACT INITIATED ON JULY ONE AND EVERYTHING'S BEEN FOLLOWING ALONG THE TERMS OF THIS CONTRACT. IT WE GET I KNOW WITH THINGS LIKE THE THE BACKUP GENERATOR THOSE WERE THINGS IN AND WE HAVEN'T EXPLORED THE IDEA OF LEASING BUT SO LAST WEEK THE CONSULTANT -- AND I SPOKE TO HER TODAY ASKED YOU GUYS WERE THE EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS WORK AND NOBODY HAD ANY IDEA WHEN THAT MONEY ONCE. AND THEN TODAY TODAY YOU'RE SAYING THAT THESE THESE -- MONIES ALREADY BEEN SPENT A ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS SO THE CONVERSATION LAST WEEK IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE CONVERSATION TODAY YEAH AND WE'VE WE FOLLOWED UP WITH A WITH A COMMITTEE STAFF LATE LAST WEEK AND PROVIDED A QUICK SUMMARY TO PAGER OF FEMALE. HOW THE FUNDS THAT THE TIMELINE OF THE FUNDS AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN WORKING OUT? IT'S JUST. WELL AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE. AND AND GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES DOESN'T HELP ANYBODY I STATED A LASTING I'M STATED AGAIN PEOPLE ARE DYING WHILE WE'RE HAVING THESE LITTLE DISCUSSIONS HERE. IT IS CRITICAL FOR ESPECIALLY WE HAVE HOMELESS. FOLKS THAT NEED THOSE SERVICES AS WELL WE HAVE VETERANS IN THE BILL SERVICES WE NEED A WHOLE ARRAY OF PEOPLE AND I WAS FIGHTING OVER A CONTRACT. IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE USE FIRST I WOULD HOPE OF YOUR TIME BUT SECONDLY WE'VE APPROPRIATED THIS MONEY FOR SPECIFICALLY THESE REASONS BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE STATISTICS WE'VE GOT. PEOPLE THAT ARE ARE DYING WE'VE GOT LET'S SEE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE -- THAT HAVE. COMMITTED SUICIDE WE'VE GOT DOUBLE THE AMOUNT. THAN HOMICIDES WE'VE HAD NINETEEN THOUSAND HOMICIDES AND FORTY FOUR DOLLARS OVER -- FORTY FOUR THOUSAND SUICIDES SO THIS IS NOT JUST A CONVERSATION ABOUT A CONTRACT DISPUTE THIS IS ABOUT ACTUAL PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT ARE BEING. IN THE ARE IN DANGER RIGHT NOW AND SEED FOR ME IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON YOU GUYS -- THE URGENCY THAT I HAVE FOR HELPING THESE PEOPLE IS NOT I DON'T FEEL THAT YOU HAVE THE SAME URGENCY THAT I DO. AND I'M ONLY SPEAKING FOR MYSELF BUT YOU HOLD HEARD FROM OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE ALL ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND IT DOES THAT EFFECT DOESN'T SEEM TO PHASE. THE DEPARTMENT AND SO WE'RE TRYING AT LEAST FOR ME HOW CAN WE GET PAST THE RED TAPE AND GET THE MONEY. TO THE THE VENDORS SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE MORE SERVICES I GUESS THAT'S THE OVERALL QUESTION. AND I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I GUESS I THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WAS LIKE OF THE CONTRACTS WERE IN PLACE AS THEY NEEDED TO BE IN PLACE AND THAT THEY'VE BEEN OPERATING AS THEY SHOULD BE OPERATING SO. I THOUGHT WE RESOLVED ALL THE CONFLICTS AND ARE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH LAST YEAR BECAUSE WE HAD WORKED WITH DD HIRSCH RIGHT AFTER WE HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS AND SO I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS WELL AND THEN. ALSO UNION AND MAYBE THAT'S MY FAULT BUT I ALSO REQUESTED AN UPDATE ON THIS AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY UPGRADES SO LAST YEAR I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR UPDATES. ON WHAT WAS GOING ON AND IF YOU CAN PROVIDE THOSE TO ME I MAYBE IT'S MY FAULT. BOBBI BUT BUT I ASKED NO NO I ASKED LAST YEAR AND AS OF RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY UPDATES SO IF YOU'VE PROVIDED THEM MAYBE I DIDN'T I OVERLOOKED THEM OR MAYBE IT WAS THIS THE CONTRACTS ARE RUMORED TO ASKING FOR THE I THOUGHT SHOULD OFFER THE CONTRACT. BUT I'D HAVE TO GO BY AS I KNOW A LOT OF INFORMATION AND SO WHAT YOU'RE TO THE BACK PART OF THE REASON WHY I AM CONCERNED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WHEN I ASKED LAST YEAR. AND FOR THIS INFORMATION I WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO GET IT SO SOMEHOW. IT'S BEEN A YEAR IN THE EITHER I GOT ALSO IS AND I KNOW THAT IT'S TYPICAL OF ALL OF US TO BE REALLY REALLY BUSY. BY THE IT'S IT FEELS LIKE SOMETIMES OF THE DEPARTMENTS DEPEND ON THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND THE SENATORS BEING BUSY SO THAT WE DON'T FOLLOW UP ON THESE. AND SO THAT'S HOW I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW SO I'M GOING TO CHECK WITH MY OFFICE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY UPDATES PROVIDED WHY DON'T WE ON THE QUESTIONS SIMPLY MEMBER WAS THAT REPORT PROVIDED TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVIEW REVIEW. I CAN'T I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST REPORTING THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THE CONTRACT WAS EXECUTED AND I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT WE HAD DONE BUT I I DON'T READ I DON'T RECALL BEING ASKED FOR REGULAR UPDATES YOU KNOW DOING SOMETHING THAT I CERTAINLY WOULD ABOUT HOW TO COLLIDE. YOU DID PROVIDE BUT I THOUGHT WE HAD PROVIDED YOUR OFFICE WITH THAT ONE BECAUSE YEAH THAT WE KNEW THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU WERE TALKING BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONTRACT AUTUMN TO PLEASE SO THAT I DO NOT I WILL GO TO MY OFFICE AND THEN. WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- RAY YES THANK YOU FOR FOR CORD BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME THIS IS ABOUT FOLKS THAT ARE DYING AND AGAIN THE URGENCY THAT THAT WE ALL HAVE A PURE DOESN'T SEEM TO PHASE THE DEPARTMENT. AND IF YOU CAN ALSO HELP ME HOW CAN WE HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF REALIZE THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY. SO I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO PERHAPS REVIEW THE THE TAPE OF THAT HEARING. AND NOTE THE REQUESTS FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO AND PROVIDE THAT TO HER I WOULD ALSO REQUEST THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED REPORT. TO THE COMMITTEE REGARDING -- THE RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED THE PROPOSED LAST YEAR IN APRIL -- IT AND EIGHT TAKE US THROUGH. OF IN ADDITION TO THAT. WHY IT WOULD LONG AS IT TOOK? AND WHAT THE RESPONSE IS -- WHY THE RESPONSE TO DIDI HIRSCH REGARDING THE EQUIPMENT AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES SO THAT IN THE END? WE'RE PROVIDING THE SERVICE BECAUSE THERE WAS A REASON FOR ALLOCATING FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THAN FOUR POINT THREE AN ONGOING FOUR POINT THREE THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A NEED AND IF THERE IS A NEED WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE FILLING THAT NEED WE ARE FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS. IN FILLING THAT NEED AND YOU. ARE MORE THAN JUST A MESSENGER YOU ARE A DECISION MAKER AND THAT IS WHY WE LOOK TO YOU. AND SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU PREPARE A MORE DETAILED REPORT WITH THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT MS RUBIO ASKED THE LAST HEARING. AND THOSE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED TODAY AND IF YOU WOULD PROVIDE THAT TO US AS WELL -- THANK YOU -- WE HAVE ANOTHER PANELIST IT'S GOING TO GIVE TESTIMONY. MOVING RIGHT ALONG IN A CAN I PASS THAT THAT IS CLEAR CLEARLY THAT IS A BIG ISSUE. YES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TO BE DOING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION -- I CERTAINLY RECALL THESE CONVERSATIONS LAST YEAR. AND THE COMMISSION'S ROLE. RELATED TO THIS VERY SPECIFICALLY AS WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A STATE WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION. THIS WAS A REQUIREMENT IN AT BUDGET TRAILER BILL -- AB ONE FOURTEEN THAT WAS DONE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE'VE GIVEN YOU A BRIEF HAND OUT THAT LAYS OUT THE WORK THAT'S UNDER WAY. THE IN THAT WE'VE HELD MULTIPLE PUBLIC HERE. MEETINGS WITH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS WE'VE DONE COMMUNITY FORUMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH DIFFERENT AREA DIFFERENT DIFFERENT -- POPULATIONS. YOU KNOW FROM SAN DIEGO HAPPENED TO SISKIYOU COUNTY AND AND FARTHER NORTH -- PER THE TIMELINE. WE ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO RELEASE A DRAFT IN APRIL. OF THIS REPORT IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S IT'S IN MY BAG -- AND WHEN WE PRESENT A DRAFT TO THE COMMISSION FOR CONSIDERATION TO A SUB COMMITTEE WITH A SAID PUBLICLY. WHICH IS ACTUALLY A REQUIREMENT UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT THAT A DRAFT THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY COMPLETED TO RELEASE TO THE COMMISSION IS A DRAFT IT SHOULD BE RELEASED PUBLICLY AND THAT WILL ALLOW US TO GET LOTS OF INPUT AND FEEDBACK FROM. COUNTIES STATE AGENCIES AND OTHERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THIS WORK -- WITH WITHIN ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO USE THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE SUMMER TO REFINE THE STRATEGIC PLAN. AND THEN MAKE IT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ONE CHALLENGE IS THAT THE COMMISSION IS NOT UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION WENT OUT AND WE'RE IT WERE AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH IT WHEN AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCY BUT WE'RE NOT UNDER THE GOVERNOR. AND SO WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH AGENCY AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO MAKE SURE. THAT IN THE DRAFTING OF A STRATEGIC PLAN DURATION WILL SUPPORT WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE A RECOMMENDATION FOR CONSIDERATION. TOO MUCH WORK HAS GONE INTO THIS AND SO WE WANT. TO SO IN THIS REGARD WERE BEHAVING AS IF WE ARE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO THE ADMINISTRATION. AND SO -- SO THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH BECAUSE THE COMMISSION IS USED TO OPERATING AS AN INDEPENDENT BODY UNDER THE ALL OF THE RULES OF THAT APPLY TO US AS A BAGLEY KEENE AGENCY RULES THAT DON'T APPLY. TO OUR COUNTERPART PUBLIC AGENCIES AND SO WE HAVE TO SORT THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES I CAN SHARE WITH YOU THAT IN IN THIS EARLY DRAFT THAT OUR STAFF HAS WORKED ON WE RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE ARE. TWO FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES ONE IS THE WHAT WE MIGHT CALL EXTRADITION TRADITIONAL STRATEGIC PLAN FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION AND THE OTHER PIECES THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE THAT STRATEGIC PLAN AFFECTED. SO WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE COUNTIES HOW DO WE SUPPORT THAT. THERE WAS A TIME BACK WHEN WE HAD THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT WE HAD AN ACTIVE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION THAT OFFICE IS NO LONGER IN THE ORG CHART. AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT NOT JUST WHAT ARE THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF SAYS TYPE OF A RELATIVE TO THE COUNTY IS VERY MUCH CONSISTENT WITH THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU'RE HAVING. I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- AS I MENTIONED LAST LAST WEEK WE ARE WORKING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND DATA ON SUICIDE WE ARE HEARING STORIES OF CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS KINDERGARTEN. YEAH TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE -- BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT HAS THE HIGHEST RATE ARE OLDER WHITE MALES IN PARTICULAR IN RURAL COUNTIES IN NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. AND SO THIS IS A VERY CHALLENGING TOPIC IT'S AND IT AND IT IMPACTS DIFFERENT POPULATIONS PEOPLE ACROSS THE THE LIFESPAN VERY DIFFERENTLY. AND SO -- WE WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DATA WE WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN PLACE INCLUDED WITHIN THE CAN'T THE WORK THAT THE COUNTIES ARE DOING. WE'VE LOOKED AT COUNTY REVENUE EXPENDITURE REPORTS AND COUNTY AND IT TO SAY PLANS THESE PLANS AND ITS EXPENDITURE REPORTS ONLY COVER PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT DOLLARS WHICH IS ABOUT 25% OF THE OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH BUDGETING -- BUT WE FOUND ABOUT FIFTY NINE PROGRAMS ACROSS TWENTY TWO COUNTIES THAT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY ARE IDENTIFIED A SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGIES SOME COUNTIES HAVE MULTIPLE INITIATIVES THAT THEY'VE LABEL THAT SUICIDE PREVENTION. WE'VE NOT LOOK SPECIFICALLY THOSE PROGRAMS THE FIRST AT PRESTIGIOUS UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN PLACE. THE SECOND STEP IS REALLY TO UNDERSTAND OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE WHICH ARE WORKING. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND SUICIDE PREVENTION WHAT KINDS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT CAN WE PROVIDE IN THIS THIS GETS CLOSER TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS EARLIER IN THE DAY? IS WHERE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONAL STRATEGIES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE HOW CAN THE STATE HELP MOVE THE STRATEGIES TO SCALE TO TACKLE ASSISTANCE THROUGH INCENTIVES THROUGH THE DATA ANALYTICS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT. TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE IMPACT IN DIFFERENT POPULAR SOME NEVER MATHIS MENTION VETERANS FOR EXAMPLE. VERY DIFFERENT THAN WORKING IN SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH AND AND WORKING ON SUICIDE TO THE SCHOOLS. WE ALSO SEE SOME CHALLENGES THAT RECENTLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS DIRECTED THE SCHOOLS TO SET OF SUICIDE PREVENTION PLANS THERE'S LEGISLATION SOME COUNTY SIR ARE ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN SAYS HAD PREVENTION PLANS AND SO HOW DO WE CONNECT THE DOTS. BETWEEN THE STATE'S PLAN THE COUNTY PLANS AND SCHOOL PLANS WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES AND AND SEARCH ENGINE SITES BECAUSE THEY OFTEN UNDERSTAND. WHO'S LOOKING FOR INFORMATION AROUND TO THE SIDE AND THEY'RE TRYING TO PUSH INFORMATION OUT TO THEIR USERS AROUND TO SAY PREVENTION INCLUDING -- SO THAT HOTLINE NUMBERS ARE WAYS TO ACCESS CARE -- BUT WE OFTEN HAVE CLUMSY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO OFTEN UNDERSTANDS BETTER WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TRENDS IN OUR PUBLIC SECTOR OFFICIALS WHO ACTUALLY HAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND KINDS OF PROGRAMS. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO EVEN AFTER THIS PLAN COMES OUT. TO REALLY BUILD THE STRESS THAT THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT SUICIDE PREVENTION IN WAYS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO DRIVE DOWN THESE NUMBERS. SUPPORT EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS AT NOT JUST THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. I'M TRYING UPON ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO OFFER. AGAIN I THINK OF YOU KNOW WE REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN PLACE WHAT WE DO TO IMPROVE WHAT'S IN PLACE. AND HOW WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE SERVICES ARE IMPACTING DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF OUR POPULATION DIFFERENTLY AND I CAN I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WILL HAVE A DRAFT HOPEFULLY NEXT MONTH AND THEN WE LEFT. TO DISTRIBUTE THAT WIDELY AND GET GET FEEDBACK I KNOW IT -- STILL WELL PUT IT TOGETHER BUT SEEN THE THE THE RATE THAT TWO HUNDRED AND 25% INCREASE WITH THE YOUNGER MEMBERS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND GOING TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID AS FAR AS URGENCY ON THOSE I THINK LOOKING AT NOT LEAST I WILL BE -- INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THAT SPECIFIC AGE GROUP BECAUSE I THINK IT IS ALARMING WHEN YOU SEE THAT HIGH OF A PERCENTAGE MOVING FORWARD. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I COULD JUST IMAGINE NOW WHAT IT IS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GOING ON TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND GETTING THAT VITAL RESOURCES IN FRONT OF THE MATTER EARLY. EARLY STAGE BEFORE THEY GET TO THE ONE EIGHT HUNDRED HOTLINE NUMBER AND AYE AYE THANK YOU SOME EVER AND I CAN SHARE WITH YOU THAT WERE ALSO NOT WAITING. FOR THE PLAN TO BE RELEASED EVEN IF THE ONES WERE DRAFTING THIS -- WE CURRENTLY ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND COUNTY AND SCHOOL PARTNERS TO TRY TO BUILD SOME LEARNING CLIMATE IS ON SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH. BECAUSE OF THIS CHANGE RANGE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A YOUTH INNOVATION AND INITIATIVE THAT WE'RE LAUNCHING RIGHTNOW IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BORN THIS WAY FOUNDATION AND OTHERS WITH THE INTENT OF BRINGING YOUNG PEOPLE TOGETHER IDENTIFY COURT CHALLENGES THAT THEY SEE WE DON'T KNOW THAT THIS TOPIC WILL BE. RECOGNIZING THE BROADER AT CHALLENGES FACING YOUNG PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW THAT THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE TOPICS BUT WHAT WE RUN WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS DESIGN USE DRIVEN INITIATIVES. THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE PRIORITIES THAT THEY HAVE RECOGNIZED AND IN ANTICIPATION THAT SUICIDE IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED. WHAT WE INTEND TO DO IS TO BRING TO GET USED GENERATED PROPOSALS THAT THEY COULD THEN PATCH TO THE COUNTIES FOR FUNDING THROUGH COUNTY INNOVATION DOLLARS? SO WE WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO EXERCISE THAT THE LIMITED LEVERAGE WE HAVE. TO MAKE SOME CHANGE EVEN BEFORE THIS PLAN FOR LEAST. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF A STROKE. MY APOLOGIES I HAD JUST ABOUT TO TAKE A CALL BUT SO YOU'RE TALKING THE PLAN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE STATE'S SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLAN CORRECT. THAT WAS DUE ON JULY. ONE THAT LEGISLATION DIRECTED US TO TRY TO MEET THAT DEADLINE -- TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE IF WE COULDN'T MEET THAT AND SO WE COMMUNICATED TO THE COMMITTEE THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE THAT DEADLINE GIVEN THE NEED TO REALLY ENGAGE THE COUNTIES AND OTHER PARTNERS. AND SO SO THAT SO THAT'S THIS IS ALMOST AND A MARCH SO. SO YOU AND I AND I MISSED THAT. YOU EXPECT THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY WHEN. SO WE GAVE YOU IT SO THERE'S THAT HAND OUT THAT WENT AROUND THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT THE LAW WAS SIGNED IN JULY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND SO WE BEGAN WORK ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO DO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WE'VE HELD MULTIPLE PUBLIC HEARINGS AND SITE VISITS -- OUR CALENDAR SUGGESTS ON THE VERY BACK PAGE THAT WE WOULD RELEASE. EIGHT A DRAFT PLAN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN WORK BASED ON FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND COUNTIES AND OTHER PARTNERS WORK TO THE SUMMER TO FINE TUNE THAT. FOR ADOPTION BY THE COMMISSION IN AUGUST SO YES WE ARE EIGHT A YEAR FOURTEEN MONTHS BEHIND IN IN IN IN FACT WIN OF THE LAW WAS WRITTEN WE TALKED WITH THE COMMITTEE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY. BUT GIVEN THE NATURE OF THIS CHALLENGE AND HOW MANY PARTNERS ARE INVOLVED THAT WE DID NOT THINK WE COULD MAKE THAT DEADLINE AND SO WE ASK THE COMMITTEE TO PUT LANGUAGE AND THAT SAYS IF YOU CAN'T MAKE THE DEADLINE LET US KNOW. AND THAT WE WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT TRACKING A FEE [inaudible] OKAY. THE CLASS ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO SOMETHING I HEARD AND BECAUSE IT JUST CAME BECAME A MINUTE AGO AND THAT WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THAT THE FUNDING FOR THE THE CALL PROGRAM -- ISN'T. ISN'T AVAILABLE UNTIL THE THE CALENDAR YEAR THE TOTAL CERTAIN YEARS ISN'T IS RECONCILED. IF THE SPECIFICALLY FOR THE TWO YEARS. I BELIEVE THAT WAS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT SPECIFIED THAT IT WAS AVAILABLE PARK. WHO YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO THAT YEAR OF ENACTMENT -- I HAVE TO GO BACK ON THE SPECIFIC DATES BUT IT'S FOR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN I THINK WAS AVAILABLE. FOR TELL. TWENTY NINETEEN NO SO IT WELL AS A QUESTION WAS IT THAT THAT IT'S THAT IT IT'S NOT. AVAILABLE UNTIL THE BUDGET YOU'RE HAS BEEN RECONCILED STAFF -- YES THOUGH THE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED -- LANGUAGE FOR TINA BELIEVE AND I'D HAVE TO GO BACK TO SEE IF IT WAS. FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AS WELL -- AND SO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT FUNDS ARE RECONCILED IN ARREARS BECAUSE THEY'RE BASED ON PERSONAL INCOME TAX. AND SO AS OF RIGHT NOW OUR REC WERE FINISHING UP THE AS EVERYONE IS FILING TAXES. EITHER THE TAX YEARS CLOSING AND SO THE FINAL -- PERSONAL CONTACT ATTRIBUTED TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN JUST COMPLETED IN THIS MARCH SO IS THAT PECULIAR TO IS THAT FOR ALL THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT PROGRAMS. SO FOR ALL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT FUNDS WE CARRY IN A COOL BOUNCE IN THERE FOR THE SUBSEQUENT AMOUNT THAT MAY BE REALIZE FOR A TAX YEAR. AND THAT WAS ESTABLISHED TO A BUDGET. BUT THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN SO THE OTHER PROGRAMS I GET NO NO YOU CAN'T YOU'RE QUITE EVENING ELSE IN THE STATE THE TâM OF THIS WAY? NO SO WHAT AND WHY IS WHY IS THIS THIS ONE IS SO IT WASN'T JUST THIS ONE THOUGH THERE WERE OTHER INVESTMENTS MADE IN IN THE BUDGET ACT THAT DID HAVE SIMILAR LANGUAGE LIKE -- I HAVE TO GO BACK TO IT REALLY I HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND I GUESS THE CONCERN THAT ONE I THOUGHT -- THE REASON IS IS BECAUSE AGAIN THE VOLATILITY OF THE MENTAL YOU EVERY ACTOR JACK YOU CAN'T I MEAN WE CAN'T PROJECT. LOOK YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THEM I GUESS FOR ME AND GOES BACK HIS FRUSTRATION THAT WE HAVE ABOUT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET ANYTHING DONE. IS YOU CAN'T PROJECT. WITHIN YOU CAN'T SAY WE'RE GONNA ALLOCATE 75% OF THE MONEY BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S NOT WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING. TO MEAN THAT MAY NOT GET IT ALL BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA SAY. 75% THAT MONIES CAN BE AVAILABLE UNTIL UNTIL IT'S RECONCILED INSTEAD WE HAVE TO WAIT A WAIT THAT ENTIRE AMOUNT OF TIME. YET I GUESS MY FROM I GUESS THE FRUSTRATION IS. THAT THE RATE OF SUICIDE IS INCREASING IT'S NOT LIKE THIS NUMBER IS GOING DOWN. AND SO ALL THESE LITTLE THANKS ALL ADD UP AND PEOPLE ARE DYING. SO I THAT'S WHY I'M CURIOUS IS LIKE I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS SET UP IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED THERE ANYTHING ELSE IN STATE GOVERNMENT THAT SET UP THIS WAY. WITH THE AT RISK POP WE HAD CONSIDERING THE AT RISK. POPULAR NATURE OF THE POPULATION WERE TALKING ABOUT HER ANYTHING ELSE AND STATE GOVERNMENT SET THIS WAY AND THEN. THE FOLLOW UP IS THAT WHY. I KNOW THE MECHANICS WHY WASN'T THERE ANOTHER OPTION EXPORTS OF THAT SOME OF THIS MONEY COULD BE FREED UP. AND ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD IN THIS DIRECTION SO. I COULD SAY THAT THERE WERE OTHER INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND THAT WERE SUBJECT TO THIS -- PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE THEM IN FRONT OF ME I COULD I COULD FOLLOW UP WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND PROVIDE THOSE OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE WE'RE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LANGUAGE. AS I I UNDERSTAND THE SENSITIVITY WITH THE THE SUICIDE HOTLINE FINING GETTING THAT OUT I DON'T THINK AT THE TIME THAT WAS CONTEMPLATION OF ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGIES. TO ALLOW THAT FUNDING TO BE AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY AT THAT TIME NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME ACCOUNT WHEN BRENT IN RESPONSE TO DOCTOR WOULD. SO YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE QUESTIONS ABOUT OTHERS YEAH I GUESS I GUESS JUST IN GENERAL I MEAN MY GOSH YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES WERE HAVING WITH WITH. TO WRITING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO PEOPLE STATEWIDE -- I'VE THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING IS IS IT JUST IS THIS -- JUST A PECULIARITY RELATED TO THIS ACT IN THIS THAN THIS FUNDING. THIS. WERE WE DOING THAT IN OTHER PLACES -- TO BECAUSE I THIS IS THE FIRST I'VE EVER HEARD. OF THE MONEY BEING ALLOCATED THIS WAY AND THESE THESE BIG GAPS AND ALL AND AND THE TIME THE MONEY IS THE MONEY IS BUDGETED OR OUT IN AND THEN THE MONEY CAN ACTUALLY BE SPENT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT BEFORE SO. BECAUSE IT IS A PROBLEM SINCE THESE PROBLEMS ARE. SORRY FIX THAT OR CAN WE FIX THAT -- WE GO BACK AND LOOK AT ANOTHER METHODOLOGY TO THE THIS FUNDING UP YES SO OUTSIDE OF THIS IS THE ONLY FUND I'M AWARE OF THAT THERE'S BEEN SUBJECT TO THIS AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING AS OF LATE. WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING IN -- THE BUDGET HAS NOT INCLUDED BUDGET IN A PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE AND SO WITH LANGUAGE WHAT IS THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET ACT CAME. FROM. THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE BIJAC CRACKED. IN AND IN WHAT YEAR -- THERE WAS LANGUAGE IN. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND PRIOR TO THAT IT WASN'T DONE THIS WAY AB. AGAIN I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND SEE WHICH WHICH FUNDING ALLOCATIONS WERE SUBJECT TO THIS -- I AM AWARE THAT THIS -- LANGUAGE HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN PREVIOUS -- INVESTMENTS FOR THIS PARTICULAR FUND. I JUST THAT JUST IT JUST FEELS LIKE THERE'S A RELUCTANCE TO SPEND THE MONEY WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE SPENT AND I'M SORRY I CAN'T COME TO ANOTHER CONCLUSION AT THIS POINT. WELL I THINK THE CORRECT SURE THE FRUSTRATION OF SOMEONE OF WOOD. WELL WE HAVE A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOLDING BACK FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. YOU KNOW I MEAN WHAT AND THE SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT IT COULD CONCOCT WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WHAT IT WOULD ACCOMPLISH. HAD A GUN OUT WHEN WE ONLY HAVE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND BILLING -- HERO. WE WANT WE WANT EVERY RESOURCE UTILIZED FOR THAT MAXIMIZING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT. CAN GET OUT AND BE USEFUL. AND AS NOTED WITH THE RATE. SUICIDE RATE INCREASING DRAMATICALLY -- HOW YOU PUT OUT HAVE A FIRE IT DOES. UNLESS YOU PUT PROPER RESOURCES TO IT AND I THINK THAT'S A FRUSTRATION. OUR EXPECTATION IS [inaudible] THAT. THAT THE MONEY BE UTILIZED IN EVERY [inaudible] POSSIBLE FASHION. TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND BEST VALUE. AND I THINK THAT IF IT IF YOU MAKE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT -- THAT THIS ISN'T WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS A COMMITTEE -- TO GET IT OUT INTO THE PUBLIC EFFECTIVELY THE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING LEGISLATIVELY SO THAT YOU HAVE THAT ABILITY TO DO SO. SO YOU NEED TO TELL US APART IS ARE YOU BEING CONSTRAINT. AS IT AS AN AGENCY. OR ARE YOU MAKING THE DECISION. BECAUSE SOMEBODY MADE THAT DECISION EITHER IT WAS A DECISION THAT WAS MADE. BASED UPON WHAT YOU THOUGHT THE LEGISLATURE WANTED OR MADE THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE BASED UPON SOMETHING THAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE LEGISLATION. THERE HAS TO BE. SOME INDEPENDENT THOUGHT WHEN WE KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAS INCLUDED THIS IN. THEY'VE INCLUDED THIS IN THE BUDGET THE INTENT FOR TO BE SPENT SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A HOLD UP OF SOME KIND. I THINK. THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD LET US KNOW. THERE IS A HOLD UP THIS IS WHY THERE'S A HOLD UP AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. IT SHOULD NOT BE. THAT WE ARE QUESTIONING SOMETHING THEIR ARGUMENTS ABOUT IT THERE SHOULD BE NO ARGUMENT. I THINK THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS CLEAR THAT THEY WANTED THIS MONEY SPENT FOR A PARTICULAR REASON. AND IT WASN'T. OR WAS DELAYED. AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AND THEY SAY JUSTICE DELAYED IS DUST JUSTICE DENIED IT'S THE SAME THING HERE. AND YOU HEARD IT THE FRUSTRATION FROM MY COLLEAGUES. ALL RIGHT. NEXT WEEK WELL THANK MANAGER THIS THE AGENDA WITH ON THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE CHAVEZ HAD PREVENTION THAT SINCE SO -- AGAIN TOBY DEALING WITH THEM AND HEALTH COMMISSION. SO YOU MAY RECALL THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED ABOUT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SUICIDE BARRIER UNDER THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE -- THE COMMISSION PROVIDED THOSE FUNDS TO THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE DISTRICT SOME TIME AGO. THE WE WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY DO A SITE VISIT WITH YOUR STAFF AND WITH SENATE STAFF TO GO OUT AND SEE PROGRESS AGAINST THE GOAL. THE THE THE BRIDGE DISTRICT EXPLAINED TO US THAT -- THAT THE SEVEN MILLION IN EMMA TO SAY FUNDS WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE NUMBERS YOU HAVE IN YOUR IN YOUR COMMITTEE AND ALSO SHOW YOU THE TOTAL BUDGET. WHAT THEY EXPLAINED TO US IS UNDER FEDERAL LAW THEY WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY MATCH THAT TO DRIVE DOWN FEDERAL MONEY THAT OTHERWISE COULD NOT BE MATCHED WITH WITH BRIDGE TOLL MONEY? AND SO EVEN THOUGH THE SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WITH A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT. HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL TO DRIVE DOWN THE BULK OF THE FEDERAL MONEY -- DURING OUR SITE VISIT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE RATIONALE FOR THE THE DESIGN OF THE NETS WHICH AS YOU AS YOU CAN SEE IN YOUR STAFF ANALYSIS ARE DESIGNED TO EXTEND OUT ON EACH SIDE OF THE BRIDGE. THIS IS BASED ON AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF STRATEGIES AROUND THE WORLD TO ACTUALLY DETER PEOPLE FROM JUMPING OFF OF OTHER HIGH STRUCTURES LIKE BRIDGES. AND THERE'S THE BRIDGE DISTRICT SHARED WITH A THEY KNOW OF WHERE THIS KIND OF A STRUCTURE HAS BEEN BUILT THAT SOMEONE LEFT AND LANDED IN THE NETWORK AND THEN CONTINUE TO GO TO THE EDGE AND JUMP IN AND MOVED DOWN TO THE AND AND ACTUALLY DIE FROM SO SIGN -- THE THE THE BRIDGE DISTRICT SHARED WITH US THAT SINCE THE BRIDGE OPENED IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE TRAVEL TO THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE TO TO JUMP INTO DIE FROM SUICIDE. IN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY ACTUALLY ENCOUNTERED TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN INDIVIDUALS AND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE STOPPED AND FORTY TWENTY SEVEN PEOPLE. JUMPED OFFICE OF THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE LAST YEAR. WHAT WHAT THE DISTRICT EXPLAIN WITH TO US THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING AND ENCOURAGING IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A? LAYERS OF STRATEGY TO PREVENT SUICIDE INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO CONSTANTLY WALK UP AND DOWN AND RIDE BIKES UP AND DOWN THE BRIDGE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE AND THEY SAID A COUPLE OF THINGS. THAT A SINGLE FEMALE WITHOUT A PURSE WE'LL GET CONTACTED WITHIN MINUTES OF BEING NOTICED. BECAUSE IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PERSON OR HAND IT'S PROBABLY IN THE CAR WITH A NOTE. AND SO EVERY WOMAN WITH NO PURSE EVERY STE I'VE I'VE FORGOTTEN THE THE DESCRIPTION OF MAN BUT IT HAD IF YOU WANT IN A JOGGING OUTFIT ANYWHERE WITH KIDS. SO THEY THEY ACTUALLY STUDY WHERE AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS PEOPLE ARE JUMPING OFF THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE TO TRY TO PUT IN PLACE INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED AROUND THE HISTORY THAT THEY'VE SEEN. AND SO -- THERE -- IN ADDITION TO LOOKING AT THE STRUCTURE OF THE BRIDGE WHERE THEY'VE HAD TO ACTUALLY READ DESIGNED THAT WAY IN WHICH THEY'LL BE ABLE TO TO DO MAINTENANCE ON THE BRIDGE WITH THE STRUCTURE. THEY ALSO TOOK US OUT TO ASIDE IN RICHMOND WHERE THEY HAVE A PROTOTYPE SO THE BEGINNING TO INSTALLTHESE PANELS I BELIEVE IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS AND THEN IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME BUT WE'VE ASKED THEM TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WILL COME BACK. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE PROGRESS AND WE'D BE HAPPY VISIT WITH YOUR STAFF AND AND WITH OTHER FROM THE LEGISLATURE WHO WANT TO SEE THAT PROGRESS. BUT THEY'RE ALSO CLEAR THAT THIS IS PART OF A AN INTEGRATED STRATEGY TO ACTUALLY TRY TO PREVENT SUICIDE ON THE BRIDGE. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ABOUT THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE DETERRENT NETS TO THE CENTER TO HAVE ANSWERS. THANK YOU FOR THAT UPDATE. HELLO TONY TALLIES. DIRECTOR IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY BEHAVIOR HOPE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SUICIDE PREVENTION. AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING I WOULD SAY ACROSS THE STATE AND MANY OF THE COUNTIES THE MAJORITY OF COUNTIES THE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SCHOOL DISTRICTS MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS I BELIEVE NOW HAVE A SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN. AND SO THE REQUIRED FOR THAT AND SO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. SYSTEMS ARE PARTNERING VERY CLOSELY IN A NUMBER OF WAYS ONE IS THE PROVIDING CLINICAL EXPERTISE AND WORKING WITH STAFF WITHIN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ANOTHER IS THERE ASSISTING WITH TRAINING. AND THE OTHER UNFORTUNATELY IS THAT THERE THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHEN SOMEBODY MIGHT. TRY TO COMMIT SUICIDE -- IN ADDITION THE COUNTIES ARE VERY ACTIVELY LOOKING OUT AS A PREVENTION STRATEGY. MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID WHICH IS A NATIONAL PROGRAM AND IT CAN BE. A TARGETED TOWARDS DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS AND DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COUNTIES ARE USING BOTH WITHIN THEIR COUNTY OPERATED SERVICES WORKING WITH CONTRACT AGENCIES AND ALSO WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- I WAS ASKED TO FILE SHARE AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I WAS ASKED TO TALK A BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN SANTA CLARA. BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A SUICIDE PREVENTION PLANNED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WHICH WE'VE ACTUALLY SHARED WITH MANY OF THE COUNTIES AND MANY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE PLAN IS EXTENSIVE IT'S CONTINUED TO GROW IN THERE A FEW HIGHLIGHTS. WE DO HAVE A HIGH SUICIDE CLUB OF YOUNG PEOPLE BUT AS TOBY WAS SAYING THE MAJORITY OF SUICIDES ARE WHITE MEN IN THEIR MID FIFTIES. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT DATA IN OUR COUNTY WE CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUPS WITH GENTLEMAN WE ASKED THEM SPECIFICALLY HOW THEY WOULD REACH HELP. IF THEY WERE FEELING -- THE DESIRE OR THINKING ABOUT COMMITTING SUICIDE AND THEY PROVIDED QUITE A BIT OF FEEDBACK TO US. AND WE INTEGRATED THAT FEEDBACK INCLUDING DOING -- A LITTLE THE PSA ANNOUNCEMENTS ON A SPORTS RADIO WHICH THE GENTLEMAN RECOMMENDED HIGHLY. REALLY DEVICE WORKED WITH THE GENTLEMAN IN THE FOCUS GROUPS TO SAY IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD PAY ATTENTION -- TO AND WE'VE TRACKED THAT WE'VE TRACKED VERY CAREFULLY OUR SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN INCLUDES A DATA. ANALYSIS GROUP OF DATA COMMITTEE WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED WITH THAT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT COMMUNICATION IN MANY MANY AREAS I HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE WE HAVE A SUICIDE CLUSTER IN THE COUNTY. BUT THEN THE PALO ALTO AREA IN MORGAN HILL WE'VE BEEN DOING QUITE A BIT ABOUT YOUTH PREVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION. OF WE'VE CONTRACTED WITH PALO ALTO UNIVERSITY WHICH IS A PROGRAM A SCHOOL THAT TEACHES PSYCHOLOGISTS BUT THEY'RE VERY FOCUSED ON CULTURE AND HOW WE CAN LOCAL IF ASKED THEM TO DO. IS FOR THE DIFFERENT CULTURAL AND ETHNIC COMMUNITY SHE IS TO REACH PEOPLE SEE THAT THERE'S HIGH SUICIDE IN DIFFERENT CULTURAL GROUPS AS WELL -- A MONTH I AM A NURSE SO I WAS A PEDIATRIC NURSE FOR A LONG LONG TIME THEY'VE BEEN A MIDDLE HOLE FOR ABOUT A DOZEN YEARS. BUT IN HEALTH CARE FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AND I WANNA SAY THAT TO ME AS THE DIRECTOR. WHAT WE'RE DOING AND PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO THE WORK WE DO? AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHY. WE ARE SEEN AND I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE FIELD IS TALKING ABOUT WITH THE DATA SHOWING US WE ARE SEEN YOUNG CHILDREN WHO ARE ANXIOUS. WHO ARE DEPRESSED WHO ARE VOICING THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE AT VERY YOUNG AGES WE'RE SEEM VERY HIGH ANXIETY AND PRE TEENS AND TEENS? AND THIS IS SOMETHING ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT IS A HUGE CONCERN TO US SO IN ADDITION TO THE SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS. IT'S REALLY LOOKING AT ALL OF THE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION THAT WE DO AT THE SCHOOL SITES. AS WELL AS THE SERVICE DELIVERY WERE DOING WORKING WITH FAMILIES -- IN OUR PROGRAMS WE START WITH BIRTH TO FIVE WE'VE GOT A VERY EXTENSIVE KEEP CONTINUUM AND WE'RE WE REALLY BELIEVE IN PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SO WE'VE INVESTED VERY VERY HELPFULLY. WITH THE INTENT OF TRYING TO PREVENT REACHING THE POINT OF NEEDING SUICIDE PREVENTION WE REALLY WANT TO GET TO THAT POINT. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT FOR MANY YOUTH IN PARTICULAR THESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE WITH THEIR FAMILIES THESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT MIGHT SHARE WITH THEIR FRIENDS WE KNOW THAT THEY TAXED. ON WE'VE WE NOW HAVE THIS TAX LAW IT'S FOCUSED ON YOUNG PEOPLE. AND WE STOOD THAT UP SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE USE THIS BECAUSE ONE OF THE WAYS TO REACH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE RAISING THESE QUESTIONS. IS THEY DON'T PICK UP THE PHONE AND TALK AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY TALK TO THEIR FAMILIES BUT THEY DO TAX WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO TRACK WHAT DATA WE CAN. RECEIVE FROM THAT TO SEE IF THEY'RE CLUSTERS WITH THE AGE GROUPINGS ARE THERE'S WE WE DON'T VIOLATE ANY OF THE PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS. BUT I THINK LOOKING A CULTURE LOOKING AT SUICIDE AT ALL LEVELS -- MANY DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS AND IDENTIFYING WITH THE BEST PRACTICES ARE NATIONALLY I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE PLAN WE PUT TOGETHER. AND WE ARE SHARING IT WITH THE OAC AND MANY OF THE COUNTIES HAVE ASKED CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE WHAT I WILL BE HONEST THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THIS COMMITTEE WHO ARE NOT PROFESSIONALS. ARE ALL FAMILY MEMBERS WHO'VE LOST CHILDREN AND THEY'RE VERY DEDICATED TO THIS WORK AND ARE LOBBYING APPEARS WELL FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION AND ALL THE THINGS THAT. ALIGN WITH THAT SO THE COUNTIES ARE DOING A GREAT DEAL MANY OF US HAVE SUICIDE PLANS AND I WANNA SAY REPRESENTING THE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR US AT EVERY LEVEL IN THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE SCHOOLS WITHIN THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES VERY VERY HIGH. PRIORITY. THANK YOU IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU'RE. YOUR YOUR YOU'VE GOT A PLAN AND YOU'VE GOT THE PEOPLE TO HELP EXECUTE THE PLAN I APPRECIATE YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] DOCTOR WOULD. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I CAN'T AND I GOT YOU GOT YOU HAVE YOUR PLAN AND NO SANTA CLARA IS IS A CLASSIC COUNTIES MORE URBAN COUNTY -- AT THE I REPRESENT SOME VERY RURAL CAN YOU DO -- AND I HATE TO KEEP REPEATING THAT BUT I WILL UNTIL I LEAVE THIS TO LEAVE THIS BUILDING BECAUSE OUR OUR THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE I BELIEVE WE'RE LOOK DIFFERENT -- LEASE CORN SOME THIS IS THE STATISTICS I'VE SEEN SO THE SOME OF THE COUNTIES I REPRESENT HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF SUICIDE AND STATE -- AND YOU'RE RIGHT THEY ARE AND AND SO THEY COMMUNICATE I GUESS COMMUNICATIONS DIFFERENT WE DON'T HAVE SOME PLACES WILL HAVE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO TEXT ONE ANOTHER. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE CELL SERVICE. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE -- NATIVE AMERICAN -- TRIBAL MEMBERS -- AND WE HAVE SEEN -- AT ONE POINT THERE WAS A CLUSTER OF CHILDREN -- YOUNG PEOPLE -- NATIVE AMERICANS AS WELL AND SO SO I GUESS PART OF WHAT I'M DOING IS I'M HOPING THAT AS THIS STRATEGIC PLAN COMES OUT FROM THE STATE. THAT IT RECOGNIZES THAT -- THE TRINITY COUNTY IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND THE STRATEGY SHOULD BE A REFLECTIVE OF THAT -- AND I AND I I'M STILL WOULD LOVE. TO UNDERSTAND WHY. YOU KNOW ANYBODY IS COMMITTING SUICIDE AT HIGHER RATES IN OUR COUNTIES AND WHAT WHAT WE'RE BECAUSE CLEARLY. WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO BETTER [inaudible] FRAZIER. THANK YOU ED YOU KNOW WHAT OF APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR AND IN YOUR CONCERN REALLY. APPRECIATED IN EARLIER WHEN YOU MENTION FIFTY ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE HOUSED. YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW COUNTIES IS TAKEN THAT KIND OF LEVEL OF A IN ALL OF EFFORT TO GO GO FOR WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. TEN THOUSAND TO BE. DONE STATEWIDE. THERE'S FIFTY COUNTIES. OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RESOURCES FOR MENTAL HEALTH BUT IN IN CHILDREN WE HAD A COUPLE IT WITH A CLUSTER SUICIDES IN MY DISTRICT ALSO FOR CHILDREN. AND THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH A DIRECTOR ACTUALLY STEP UP FOR THE SCHOOLS. AND PROVIDED RESOURCES BECAUSE I THINK I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE AND HEARINGS. THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THE LC OF FAITH FUNDING FORMULA. A DON'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST OR A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- ADEQUATE FOR THE POPULATION IS THERE. AND SO -- YOU KNOW I GUESS IT TAKES A VILLAGE I APPRECIATE. THE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR LEVEL OF OF FOCUS FOR THE POPULATION BUT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A A LARGER. BUT LARGER EFFORT. STATE COUNTY. COLLABORATION -- TO LIVE SAID BEFORE YOU CAN'T PUT OUT HALF OF FIRE. YOU'VE GOT IT IDENTIFIED THE NEED AND ATTACK IT WITH ALL VIGOR. AND QUIT THE JUST BITTEN PIECING THESE THINGS. BECAUSE WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE ANY KINDS OF STRIFE SO THANK YOU. MAY I RESPOND PARTICULARLY YOUR QUESTION -- WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MIDDLE AGED WHITE MEN AND WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHILE THE ISSUES AND SANTA CLARA MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IN THE SMALL COUNTIES. I THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY MORE COMMON COMMONALITY THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT AND I WOULD BE HAPPY I KNOW THE ALL THE DIRECTORS AND I'VE WORKED WITH THE SMALL COUNTIES. I WILL REACH OUT TO THE DIRECTORS IN YOUR DISTRICT AND CERTAINLY LET THEM KNOW WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH ALL WITH MIDDLE AGED ADULTS. I'M I AM VERY HAPPY TO DO SAY TO THAT THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS HERE I AM REPRESENTING CB HDA AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN SANTA CLARA. BUT THE WAY I LOOK AT SANTA CLARA IS THAT WE HAVE RESOURCES TO DO THINGS BUT WE WANT TO SHARE THAT AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR FULL OF FULL SYSTEM -- ACROSS THE STATE SO WHEN I'M SHARING IS BECAUSE WE HAVE RESOURCES IN THE COUNTY VERY STRONG SUPPORT FROM OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE ARE IN SILICON VALLEY'S THEY LIKE INNOVATION. BUT WHAT I SAY TO THE DIRECTORS AND I WANNA SAY TO ALL OF YOU WHILE I SIT HERE AND SAY THESE OF THINGS WERE DOING. YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN TRIAL AND ERROR. WE'VE LEARNED A LOT WERE WE'VE DONE A LOT RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK I'M AND WE'RE ALL VERY PROUD OF BUT WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO LEARN FROM THIS. AND THE REAL MEASURE IS ARE WE SEEING A DECREASE IN SUICIDES IN OUR COUNTY ACROSS OUR STATE THAT'S REALLY THE MEASURE OF THIS WORK A PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT COMMENT. I DON'T I DON'T. A LITTLE BIT. HOW LONG IS YOUR PLAN BEEN IN EFFECT? SEVERAL YEARS AND I'M I'VE BEEN THERE FOR YEARS AND IT WAS IN PLACE WHEN I WALKED IN MAYBE IT WAS THE FIRST REITERATION. SO RECOGNIZING THAT THEY THESE PLANS CONTINUE TO INVOLVE WAIT WHAT IS YOUR NUMBER RELATIVE TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE AND ARE YOU SEEING ARE YOU SEEN. AND IT AN INCREASE IN TRACK AND IN FOR YOU SEEN AS AS LEVELED OFF AND IT'S IT'S LEVELED OFF SOMEWHAT -- WERE TRACKING BOTH THE YOUTH -- WE ACTUALLY IN SANTA CLARA WE HAD A CDC KIND OF THE CDC CAME IN BECAUSE OF OUR CLUSTERS. AND WE'VE WORKED REALLY CLOSELY WITH MANY MANY COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO TRY TO DECREASE THOSE NUMBERS FOR YOUTH. AND THEN ON THE MIDDLE AGE CLOSELY AS WELL. SO -- WE HAVE A TEAM I'VE FUNDED AT THROUGH IMAGE SAY -- WERE ACTUALLY ADDING MORE MANY AT THIS POINT IN TIME -- BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT SOMEBODY THAT CAN BE TOTALLY FOCUSED ON THE MIDDLE AGED MAN FROM A COMMUNICATIONS STANDPOINT AN ENGAGEMENT STANDPOINT SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE SOME ADDITIONAL STAFF TO HELP US. SO IS YOUR TEAM FUNDED IN THE SAME WAY THAT I WAS -- VOICING CONCERNS ABOUT. YES WE ARE FINDING OUT THAT. IT'S A VERY DIRECT QUESTION YES -- I KNOW. SO I WILL TELL YOU THAT FUNDING IN GENERAL IS VERY CHALLENGING -- FOR THE COUNTIES BECAUSE WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT ARE FUNDING WILL BE FOR AN HSA WE DEVELOP PLANS. AND WE THINK OKAY THIS IS OUR FUNDING. AND THEN THAT FUNDING CAN SHIFT IT CAN GO UP OR IT CAN GO DOWN. OF WE WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITH A CONSULTANT TO WORKS WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO LOOK AT WHAT THE ESTIMATES WILL BE IN TERMS OF THE TAXES. SO THAT COUNTIES CAN THE FUNDING WILL LOOK LIKE BUT IT IT IS CHALLENGING. I I JUST HAVE TO SAY ON BEHALF OF ALL COUNTIES IT'S VERY CHALLENGING SO ANOTHER METHOD OF FUNDING MIGHT. POTENTIALLY HELP COUNTIES TO ACTUALLY SPEND SOME OF THIS MONEY WELL I THINK THE IMAGE AS A IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY IT ALLOWS US TO DO PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. IT ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE MANY TYPES OF SERVICES THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE COVERED UNDER MEDICARE ALL. AND SO IT'S ENABLED A LOT OF THE SERVICES THAT YOU'VE HEARD IN THIS HEARING AND ANOTHER HEARINGS -- BUT NOT WITH PREDICTABILITY. NOT WITH PREDICTABILITY IN TERMS OF THE OF THE FUNDING PIECE NOW. AND SO THAT CREATES SON CERTAINLY WITHIN YOUR PROGRAMS AND IT IS CHALLENGING FOR COUNTIES -- WHEN WE COMPLETE A PLAN OUR IMAGE AS A PLAN GOES EVERY YEAR WE HAVE AN UPDATE? AND WE GO TO OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND MORE MANAGING VERY VERY CAREFULLY HOW WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY. BUT IT'S ALSO CHALLENGING FOR COUNTIES BECAUSE ONCE THE MONEY ARRIVES WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE PLAN AND THEN WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT. AN IMPLEMENT -- IMPLEMENTING IF YOU HAVE CONTRACT AGENCIES REQUIRES PROCUREMENT PROCESS SO EVERYTHING GETS DELAYED IT'S NOT IT'S RARELY BECAUSE I I I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S NEVER BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE HAVE SOMETHING BE DELAYED BUT IT'S A COMBINATION OF FACTORS YES SO -- AND THAT THIS THIS GOES BACK. TO OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAD A MORE DEPENDABLE IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO PROCURE THE MONEY SO YOU COULD HAVE THE PREDICTABILITY THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING YOU WOULD HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN. WELL I THINK WE WOULD HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN PREDICTABILITY I AM ALSO VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE ACT IN THE FUNDING IS BASED ON A TAX ON MILLIONAIRES TAX. AND SO -- AND IT'S LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATED SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT WOULD BE EASILY FIGURED OUT THAT WOULD BE FOR ALL OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DO WITH THE GOVERNOR -- I DO THINK THAT THE PREDICTABILITY CAN BE CHALLENGING ESPECIALLY FOR THE SMALLER COMPANIES OURS AS WELL BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THE SMART THAT WAS THE POINT THANK YOU YES. AND IF I MAY ACT. SPECIFICALLY FOR THE FUNDING THAT GOES OUT TO THE COUNTIES I JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THE FUNDS AND THEY WERE JUST BEING SPOKE ABOUT THOSE ARE ALLOCATED TO COUNTIES MONTHLY. SO 95% OF FUNDS FOR THE ACT GO DIRECTLY OUT TO THE COUNTIES ARE ALLOCATED TO THE COUNTIES MONTH ON A MONTHLY BASIS BASED ON INCOMING REVENUE. THE 5% IS WITH HELD FOR STATE DIRECTED PURPOSES WAS THE FUNDING THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER. ALL RIGHT IN THE ANYBODY ELSE ON THE PANEL. SO WHAT IS A 5% ACTUALLY ADD UP TO NEARLY FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE MHS. SO I BELIEVE IN NINETEEN TWENTY WERE ESTIMATING IT TO BE. I WANT TO SAY UPWARDS OF MAYBE A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION. THROUGH TO ADMINISTER THE IMAGES SAY. IT'S COSTING A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR THE STATE TO THE RESTAURANT SO WELL WE WE WE TRY TO GET STAY AWAY FROM THE TERM ADMINISTRATIVE BECAUSE IT'S NOT FOR TRUE ADMINISTRATION SO MUCH AS IT'S FOR MORE STATE DIRECTED PURPOSES. SO WHILE THERE ARE SOME FUNDING STREAMS -- ALLOCATIONS WITHIN THE STATE DIRECTED PURPOSE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES IT IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES SUCH AS COUNTY GRANTS AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE PARTY SO. YEAH I'D LIKE TO I'D ACTUALLY. UP WHEN I ASKED WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE BORNE OUT OF THE MHSAA I DON'T WANT -- TO FIGURE OF OTHER. COSTS BORNE BY IT SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS WHAT IS THE DIRECT COST. OF THE STATE TO ADMINISTER THEM HSA. HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING -- DEPLETED AWAY FROM THE ACTUAL SERVICES GOOD COULD BE PROVIDED. SO FOR NINETEEN TWENTY THERE'S APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION -- FOR STATE ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES OKAY THANK YOU. THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO IMAGES SAY OR OTHER OR THE OTHER STATE ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES. AS PRIMARILY IT'S A IT'S A MIX. THERE'S APPROXIMATELY. SOME OF IT'S GOING TO STATE ADMINISTRATION SO STATE POSITIONS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. THERE IS ALSO SOME FUNDING IN THERE FOR THINGS LIKE SUICIDE HOTLINES AND TRIAGE. GRANTS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] I THINK. I'M. MORE QUESTIONS [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. IS THAT -- I A I WOULD JUST ADD THE AYE TWICE A YEAR THANK YOU BRENDA THAT TWICE A YEAR THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES PUBLISHES THEIR AN HSA. A REPORT WHICH OUTLINED ALL THE ACTIVITIES THERE -- AND AT THAT ARE BEING SPENT FROM THE ACT. AND SO THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THAT OUTLINES ALL THE ACTIVITIES FOR THAT FOR THOSE PURPOSES. SO IT OUTLINES HOW MUCH SO SO WE'D HAVE TO FIND A FROM COUNTIES HOW MUCH THEY'RE ACTUALLY SPENDING ON ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES IS FOR FOR THE EMMY IMAGE AS WELL AS WELL. AND WE'RE THAT THAT IS OUT OF IT IS THAT INFORMATION ACTUALLY COLLECTED. TOTAL IN AN AGGREGATE YES -- YES SO WE DO THE SO COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT THEIR ANNA ANNUAL REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE REPORTS TO US BY DECEMBER THIRTY ONE OF EVERY YEAR. SO WE WE DO HAVE THE THAT DATA AVAILABLE WE MAKE THAT AVAILABLE I THINK -- SO WE CAN GET YOU GOT TO SEE YOU IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT COUNTIES ARE SPENDING THEIR MONEY ON BY COMPONENT OF THE MHSAA. AND THEN I THINK WHAT CHRIS WAS TALKING ON WERE SAYING MIGHT BE ALSO HELPFUL FOR YOU IN TERMS OF IF YOU WANT. TO SEE WHAT THE STATE ADMIN DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT ON WE HAVE A REPORT THAT JUST OUTLINED BY EVERY LINE ITEM HOW MUCH IS ALLOCATED TO ALL THE DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS AND DIFFERENT ENTITIES. THAT ARE USING THAT FUNDING FOR DIFFERENT PROP PURPOSES OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO RECEIVE A REPORT. OKAY. WOULD YOU PROVIDE THAT TO US PLEASE [inaudible] VERY GOOD. THINK THIS CONCLUDES ISSUE NUMBER. TWO PUBLIC COMMENT TO THEM. GOOD AFTERNOON ADRIAN CHILTON WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE -- WE'RE VERY ALARMED WITH THE NUMBERS THAT WERE SEEN IN THE RISING SUICIDE RATES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. THESE ARE PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THOSE IMPACTED BY IT SUICIDE. I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND THE COMMITTEE THE CHAIR AND THE TIME THE MEMBERS FOR THE DISCUSSION EARLIER ABOUT THE SUICIDE PREVENTION. HOTLINE CONTRACT THIS IS QUITE LITERALLY A LIFELINE TO SO MANY. AND THIS MUST BE A RESOLVED FOR THE THE QUESTIONS AND CAREFUL DISCUSSION WERE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE WORK OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION AND THE SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN. THAT THEY ARE DEVELOPING -- BUT ALSO THINK THAT LOCAL PROGRAMS SHOULD HAVE SUICIDE PREVENTION PLANS TO ADDRESS THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS THE LOCAL POPULATION SIMILAR TO THE WORK. THAT SANTA CLARA COUNTY HAS DONE REALLY CONSIDER THEIR PLAN A MODEL FOR THE STATE -- BUT REALLY JUST WANTED TO AND WITH THAT WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE PROACTIVE EFFORTS AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND THANK THE COMMITTEE IT TODAY FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC THANK YOU. CHECK OUT ANY WITH THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMITTEE BE FOR HEALTH AGENCIES -- DD HIRSCH IS ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF CB HA AND WE SUPPORT OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO GET -- FOUR POINT THREE MILLION AND ALLOCATION FROM THE STATE BUDGET FOR STATEWIDE SUICIDE PREVENTION FUNDING. THEY'RE ASKING FOR AN INCREASE BECAUSE SANTA CLARA COUNTY RECENTLY BECAME A PART OF THE CALIFORNIA LIFE PLACE CENTERS WHICH INCREASES THE FROM TEN TO ELEVEN CENTERS. FROM SANTA CLARA ALSO TAKES THE THIRD MOST AMOUNT OF CALLS OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CALLS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE -- AND THEIR CRITICAL TATTING OVERALL CAPACITY TO THE NETWORK -- WE KNOW THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUNDING PROCESS AND DIDI HIRSCH IS ALSO COMMITTED. TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE AT THE MAY HEARING. ARM CH IS ALSO ANSWER STATE TRAINING AS A SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGY AND WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD. TO DISCUSSING OUR PROPOSAL WITH THE COMMITTEE IN MAY AS WELL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHTS LET'S GO TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE EARLY PSYCHOSIS RESEARCH AND TREATMENT FUNDING AND BUDGET CHANGED PROPOSAL. OKAY SO WHEN A GREAT WISH -- ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- SO ARE THE DEPARTMENT -- OF IT A THE MINISTRATIONS PUT -- TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE BUDGET ARE REQUESTING FOR THIS FUNDING FOR EARLY PSYCHOSIS RESEARCH AND TREATMENT -- SO IT WOULD ALLOW -- FOR UP TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THE ADMIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE FOR GRANT FUNDS -- FOR A VARIETY FOLKS IS NOT JUST FOR COUNTIES BUT A DIFFERENT ENTITIES WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THESE FUNDS -- AND I THINK THAT'S IT SO -- SO IT'S LOOKING FOR JUST A ONE TIME -- AUGMENTATION. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WERE STILL DEVELOPING SORT OF THE GRANT REQUIREMENTS AND ALL OF THAT SO THAT HAS NOT COME OUT YET IN TERMS OF COMMENT. FOR WHAT WOULD BE LOOKING. FOR BUT HE AND AS BRENDA SAID THIS WOULD BE WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS IS AVAILABLE FOR NOT JUST COUNTY ENTITIES BUT NONPROFIT AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AS WELL GIVEN THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY AN FOR HELPING -- IDENTIFY EARLY ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT NEED THAT TREATMENT. VERY GOOD. BUT I WOULD QUESTION -- AND GOING TO GO. AB [inaudible] THIRTEEN FIFTEEN IF. STATURE WERE AMENDED TO ALLOW FOR THE USE OF STATE FUNDS. WOULD NOT MAKE MORE SENSE TO FUND THE EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAM THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR ALREADY CREATED AT THE COMMISSION. YES I THINK IF LANGUAGE WERE ADOPTED THAT SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COULD CONSIDER HOWEVER GIVEN THAT THESE FUNDS ARE -- WELL YEAH I GUESS -- THANK YOU I WAS THINKING BUDGET YEAR YEAH -- BUT IT WAS I WOULD NOTE THOUGH THAT. THESE ARE ONE TIME FUNDS AND THE INTENT WAS REALLY TO STAR IN TEN MINUTES THIRTY FUNDS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I'M NOT PRIVY TO THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL AND THIS TAKES ME BACK TO OUR LONG DISCUSSION. THEIR INTENDED TO BE USED IMMEDIATELY AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT I LONGTIME TO DESCRIBE I'M BEING FUNNY ABOUT IT BUT IT IS A SERIOUS ISSUE YEAH. AND OKAY. VERY GOOD DO ANY OF THE OTHER PANELS ONE SPEAK TO THIS SORT CHAIR TOBY YOU IN WITH A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. SO AS YOU MENTIONED AB ONE THIRTEEN FIFTEEN THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY STANDING UP AND ARE THEY PSYCHOSIS GRANT PROGRAM. ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THE COMMISSION ENGAGE THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DAVIS TO DO SOME ANALYSIS OVER THE PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMS THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT YOU CAN INTERVENE EARLY. IN THE LIFE OF THE YOUNG PERSON OR SOMEONE WHO'S EXPERIENCING PSYCHOSIS AT THE FIRST BREAK YOU HAVE A MUCH BETTER LIKELIHOOD OF DEVELOPING A TREATMENT PLAN. THAT THAT WORKS FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL AND BUT THROUGH THAT RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS WIDE VARIATION IN HOW COUNTIES ARE APPROACHING. EARLY ON SAID OUR FIRST ANSETT PSYCHOSIS IN AND SO -- WITH THAT WITH THE UNIVERSITY COUNTIES TO WE WE FUNDED UC DAVIS TO PROVIDE TA TO COUNTIES. TO DESIGN AN EARLY PSYCHOSIS STRATEGY. WHERE COUNTIES ARE PUTTING THEIR OWN FUNDING INTO? A LEARNING COLLABORATIVE THAT INVOLVES HALF A DOZEN COUNTIES AT THE MOMENT WHERE THEY'VE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO DEDICATE ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION COUNTY DOLLARS EARLY PSYCHOSIS STRATEGIES WITH ABOUT A MILLION AND A HALF AND PHILANTHROPY. THE IDEA THAT WE STARTED UNDER THE UNDER THE BROAD RUBRIC OF THIRTEEN FIFTEEN IS TO BUILD THIS LEARNING COMMUNITY WERE UC DAVIS IS ACTUALLY DOING DATA ANALYTICS WORK FOR THE COUNTY SAN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ACTUALLY HELP THEM SHAPE THEIR EARLY PSYCHOSIS STRATEGIES. BASED ON BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE WERE PARTNERING WITH UC DAVIS AS PART OF AN APPLICATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE PART OF A NATIONAL NETWORK OF EARLY PSYCHOSIS LEARNING. COMMUNITIES AND IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS AROUND THE COUNTRY. CIVIC TO THE THIRTEEN FIFTEEN PROCESS WERE REQUIRED TO APPOINT AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE WE ARE SENDING OUT LETTERS THIS WEEK FOR PEOPLE REPRESENTING THE SEATS AND A THIRTEEN FIFTEEN THE LAW REQUIRES US ACTUALLY TO GO OUT AND WORK AND RAISE PRIVATE DOLLARS THAT WE WOULD THEN GIVE AWAY. THROUGH THE PROGRAM THERE ARE NO PRIVATE DOLLARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AS YET WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FINANCE. TO SEE HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY USE SOME EXISTING FINDS TO DO SOME FUNDRAISING TO TRY TO PUT MONEY INTO THE ACCOUNT THAT HASBEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE THIRTEEN FIFTEEN WERE ALSO ISSUING REGULATIONS ARE BEGINNING THAT PROCESS. RUN EARLY TAKE US IS PROGRAMS AND SO YOU KNOW WITH THE COMMISSION HAS SUGGESTED THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE STATE TO HAVE AN UNFUNDED PROGRAM. AT THE COMMISSION AND A FUNDED PROGRAM EVEN IF IT'S SHORT TERM AT THE DEPARTMENT WE WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO LINK THEM ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THE COMMISSION WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD ON THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE. AND AND YOU KNOW IMPLEMENT GRANTS AS TO DOLLARS BUT IF YOU'RE NOT INCLINED TO DO THAT. WE WOULD REQUEST THAT YOU TAKE THE PROGRAM THAT WE'RE BUILDING AND MOVE IT OVER TO DH CS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE. TWO HALFS NOT TALKING TO EACH OTHER. HAVE AN ENTRY ON SEPT HAVE THAT'S WONDERFUL -- THERE IS A BILL PENDING -- THAT WOULD THE WOULD ALLOW THE USE OF STATE FUNDS SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL MAKE ITS WAY THROUGH. AND BY THE TIME WE HAVE THE ACTUAL MONEY THERE AND IT. IT'LL HAVE A SOFT PLACE TO LAND WONDERFUL ANYTHING ELSE FROM THE COULD PANELISTS DOCTOR WOULD. ROUGHLY WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE ALTER THE PANELSUMS ARE NOT AMONG THE PANELISTS AND YOU KNOW WHAT DON'T. MAKE ME YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME DOWN HERE. THIS MIGHT BE WILL WARM. THE WITH THE GRANTS THAT THE WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE FOR SIZE OF GRANT'S. MANY GRANTS WILL THEY BE COMPETITIVE NON COMPETITIVE URBAN ROLE CAN YOU I MEAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR GRANTS SO. WHAT IT WHAT DO YOU TO WHAT WERE THEY GOING WELL SO UNDER THE TERMS OF THIRTEEN FIFTEEN THE COMMISSION IS DIRECTED TO APPOINT THIS ADVISORY BODY OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND THERE ARE SOME CERTAIN? SEATS THAT ARE THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF FERRETING THAT OUT WHAT IS YOU KNOW WHAT TO THE CRITERIA BE. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS BEST BUT IT'S BEST AVAILABLE USED TO THESE DOLLARS -- THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YOU KNOW WE SAW THAT IN JANUARY WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CAME OUT AND SO. WE WERE WORKING TACK CAN MEET THE TERM TO THIRTEEN FIFTEEN WHICH REQUIRES US TO RAISE PRIVATE FUNDS. SO -- IS TO IT WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE'RE JUST WE JUST DID A NASA A STATEWIDE INVITE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SERVE ON THIS ADVISORY BODY LETTER TO GOING OUT THIS WEEK TO APPOINT FOLK TO THAT. BOARD AND SO WE'RE SORT OF IN THIS AWKWARD SITUATION OF DO WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO PUT THAT IN PLACE. DO WE SHIP THAT OVER TO DH CS WILL THAT FUNDING MOVE INTO THIS FIND -- WE'RE HAPPY TO OPERATE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE ORIGINAL THIRTEEN FIFTEEN TO RAISE PRIVATE FUNDS BUT BUT IT WE'VE LOOKED AT MODELS AROUND THE STATE HOW TO DO THAT THERE IS SOME AMBIGUITY. IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN USE PRIVATE MONEY TO REPUBLIC MONEY TO RAISE PRIVATE MONEY AND AND THAT WE'VE REYES THAT QUEST WITH FINANCE AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO SORT THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ANSWERS. I GUESS I GUESS I WAS JUST TRYING I JUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE SIZE OF THE GRANTS OR WHAT BUT PEOPLE MIGHT ENVISIONED BECAUSE THE NEXT LINE DOWN WAS A TALK ABOUT THIS PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WAS UP TO A MILLION DOLLARS. TO STATE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATE WITH THESE GRANTS SO THAT'S A MILLION DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY SO. IF THAT MILLION DOLLARS IS IT IS FOUR FIVE GRANTS THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY THAT MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR A HUNDRED GRANTS THAT MAYBE THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT I'M SORRY MILLION DOLLARS THAT. COULD BE GOING MORE TOWARDS ADDITIONAL CARE FOR PEOPLE SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SO. SO UNDER THE TERMS OF THIRTEEN FIFTEEN IF THERE'S FUNDING AND THAT BUDGET THE COMMISSION IS AUTHORIZED TO SPEND UP TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. IT TO IMPLEMENT THE TERM TO THIRTEEN FIFTEEN AND SO AGAIN THAT WAS THE THE LAW FROM LAST YEAR SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ISA DIFFERENT BEAST AND I'D DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT AND FINANCE. TO I I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE FIFTEEN SPECIFICALLY SAID THEY CANNOT USE STATE FUNDS. SO THIS TWENTY FIVE MILLION CANNOT BE USED TO FUND THIRTEEN FIFTEEN ALTHOUGH THAT SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE THING TO DO -- BUT THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T ALLOW IT -- THERE IS ANOTHER BILL PENDING THAT WOULD THEN ALLOW THEM -- TO TO THIRTEEN FIFTEEN TO USE THE STATE FUNDS. SO HOPEFULLY. NOT HOPEFULLY. MR FRAZIER [inaudible] SO. YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT AN ALLOCATION TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. YOU'RE ALREADY IN PROCESS. THEY WOULD HAVE TO RECREATE THE WHEEL AND START FROM SCRATCH. WHY WOULD YOU HAND OVER SOMETHING I MEAN IT'S YOUR BABY WHY WOULD YOU HAND OVER SOMETHING IS ALREADY IN PROCESS? KNOWING THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY STE TAKE THE BALL AND CONTINUE TO RUN AND THIS WOULD. TAKE MORE TIME TO IMPLEMENT HIS HE'S GOT NO MONEY WELL. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS IS. IS ZERO SIX MONEY -- BUT WHAT IS A CRITICAL NEED I MEAN IN YOUR STUDIES IN IN YOUR WORK WHEN YOU LOOK AT EARLY PSYCHOSIS. WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF FUNDING. THAT YOU NEED TO BE EFFECTIVE. CERTAINLY OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IT'S A START IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE WE WE PUT A OF OF POCKET MONEY HERE WITH A LITTLE BIT HERE. IT'S LIKE A LIKE PLAYING ROULETTE [inaudible] OKAY. TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE PLAYING ROULETTE. WE'LL PUT A LITTLE BIT HERE AND HAD YOUR BEST LITTLE BIT HERE. DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH IT TAKES TO DO THESE THINGS CAN BE EFFECTIVE. SO AT THAT OUT INTO THE FIRST QUICK QUESTION AT THAT IF I WAS ASKED TO SPLIT THE BABY I WOULD GIVE UP MY HALF OF THE BABY. SO YOU KNOW WHY WOULD I GIVE UP A PROGRAM THAT WERE ALREADY RESIDING UP AND RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW SUBJECT TO THE DELIBERATIONS BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE STATE TO HAVE TO PROGRAMS AND SO YOU KNOW IDEALLY FUND THE PROGRAM THAT THAT YOU AUTHORIZE LAST YEAR. BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN THE LAW WHICH YOU KNOW VERY CLEARLY AS AS FROM MEMBER WOULD MENTION EARLIER THAT THAT'S THE BUSINESS THAT YOU'RE IN -- IN TERMS OF THE I I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD TAKE I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS GENERATED FROM COUNTY FUNDS AND PHILANTHROPY WE PUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE TABLE. TO FACILITATE GENERATING TEN MILLION. IN PHILANTHROPY AND COUNTY DOLLARS SO WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK CLOSELY AT HOW TO LEVERAGE THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO CREATE THE RIGHT KINDS OF INCENTIVES. TO HELP TEACH COUNTIES HOW TO STAND UP THESE PROGRAMS AND CREATE THE BUILDING STRUCTURE UNDER MEDI CAL AND OTHER SOURCES SO THAT THAT SO THAT THE PROGRAM TO BE SUSTAINED. OUR OUR QUINCY DALY OUR SENSE WAS THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY NEED BUT BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO TRY TO DESIGN A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE WHERE EVERY COUNTY HAD AN EARLY PSYCHOSIS STRATEGY IN PLACE. OUT OF ACCOUNTING THE STANDALONE PROGRAM. SMALL COUNTIES PROBABLY CAN'T DO THAT BUT THEY NEED A PARTNERSHIP. RIGHT THEY NEED TELEMEDICINE THEY NEED THESE THESE APPROACHES WE HAVE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT AT THE REVENUE STREAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE PROGRAMS. ON GOING SUCH AS MEDICARE RIGHT AND SO HOW DO WE BRING THIS COSTS DOWN SO I WOULD SAY -- WE CAN DO A TON OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS EVEN ONE TIME. AND AND AND THAT MAY BE SUFFICIENT BUT I'D I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT REALLY GETS THAT OUR CAPACITY TO LEVERAGE THAT AGAINST OTHER FUNDING. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU KNOW THE VALUE OF THESE HEARINGS. WERE FINDING OUT WHERE THE SHORTCOMINGS ARE OF EVEN LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED WHERE WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN. AND GENERATE -- FIXES GOING ALONG LIKE THE FUNDING OF THE SUICIDE HOTLINE MONIES IN WHATNOT SO. I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S CANDOR NEXTPART TO BE FIXING THINGS THANK YOU THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR DO YOU MIND IF I JUMP IN BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WERE REALLY MORE DIRECTED AT WHAT WHAT WERE DOING OBVIOUSLY WE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE DIRECTED HAVE THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION SO I JUST WANTED TO ANSWER SOME OF DOCTOR WOULD QUESTIONS. AS I MENTIONED I THINK WE ARE WE ARE STILL DEVELOPING SORT OF WHO CAN APPLY AND ALL OF THAT WE ARE LOOKING OUT FOR ANY LARGER GRANTS THAT. THE NONPROFIT OR THE COUNTY BE PUTTING UP MATCHING FUNDS IN ORDER TO HELP SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL WORK AND SO AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF GRANTS -- BUT THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP IN FOR WORK WITH OUR COUNTY AND OTHER OTHER PARTNERS SO THAT THEN WE CAN HAVE COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE HAVING COME OUT. ONE THANK YOU. WHY WOULD YOU EXPECT THE NON NOT IN THE? PRIVATE SECTOR TO INVEST IN. IN A STATEMENT. REQUIRED THE PROGRAM THAT IS A STATE ISSUE. SO BASED ON THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT -- OUR FELLOW PANELISTS OF TALK ABOUT WE ARE SEEING LOCAL NONPROFIT TO ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING THIS IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY AND SO WE WANT TO HELP FUNDS THAT TO HELP US UNDERSTAND AS A STATE WHICH TYPES OF SERVICES WHAT'S TYPES OF STRUCTURES ARE ACTUALLY GONNA WORK. THEN WE CAN SCALE UP TO A FULLY STATEWIDE PROGRAM OKAY AND I'M SEEN HE HAS TO FUNCTIONALLY ON PRIVATE DONATIONS. BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY A. B. THIRTEEN I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THERE SHOULD BE. AN EFFORT. THIRTEEN FIFTY THROUGH THIS TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO TO WORK TOWARDS THEIR SUCCESS ALSO. YEAH. THAT WOULD BE THE LOGICAL THING BUT HEY. MADAM CHAIR COULD I MAKE A COMMENT ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK PREVIOUSLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. THERE'S A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE AS AS IF WE GET THIS RIGHT WE CAN PREVENT YOUNG PEOPLE FROM WINDING UP FOR THE ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM YES THERE'S LOTS AND LOTS OF RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN CAN. THE C. B. H. DATE TURN TOTALLY SPORTS THIS -- IN MY COUNTY WE ARE ON IT AND I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS AND HOW TO SCALE IT UP THIS THIS. IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING WE HAVE LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE COMING OUT OF JAIL AND THE WAY THAT WE STEM THAT TIDE. IS WE BECOME EXPERTS WITH THESE SERVICES AND SUPPORT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE SAID TO ME THIS IS WHERE I'D I JUST THINK THIS IS HUGELY IMPORTANT. AND I'M ALSO GOING TO STEP OUT ON THE LIMB BECAUSE YOU ASKED ABOUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IF WE LOOK FORWARD -- TO ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PARTICULARLY SOMETHING LIKE THIS. ON THE PUBLIC SIDE WE FUND THESE PROGRAMS BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE FOR THE COMMERCIAL PLANS THE THE PRIVATE PLANS. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD IMAGINE I KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS INTERESTED IN. AND MISTER EWING IS INTERESTED IN AND AS THE COUNTIES WERE INTERESTED IN IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THESE SERVICES TO ANY YOUNG PERSON. REGARDLESS OF IF THEY'RE MEDI CAL OR IF THEY'RE COMMERCIALLY INSURED. TO FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK YOUR PHYSICIAN I'VE BEEN AND HEALTH CARE FORTY YEARS. THIS TO ME IS -- PIECES OF WORK WE CAN DO FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT A DOUBT. AND SO I JUST WANT YOU TO HEAR MY ADVOCACY AS SOMEONE WHO RUNS A LARGE SYSTEM AND I WILL SAY THAT. IN COMPARISON WITH THE ID DE POPULATION. THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS OF THE FH MOSER PPO CANNOT FULFILL THE OBLIGATION. OF THE LETTERMAN ACTING AND MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUAL SERVICE AND THAT THE REGIONAL SERVICE CENTERS ARE HAVE TO AUTOMATICALLY FUND THAT INDIVIDUALS -- SERVICES. THERE'S A MODELS ARE WORKING. I MEAN I I I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO RECREATE THE WHEEL. IT WORKS IN A POPULATION OF OF IN THE IN THAT CAPACITY. WELL IN THIS. I THINK THEY WERE ALL MISSING. TO TO YOUR POINT WHAT ON THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION IS GIVEN ESTIMATED THAT 50% OF ALL MENTAL ILLNESS BEGINS AT THE AGE OF AND UNTREATED INCREASES THE INDIVIDUAL'S RISK FOR SUICIDE. HOMELESSNESS AS THE NEED FOR MORE MENTAL HEALTH SO IF WE LOOK AT THE COST EARLY ON VERSUS THE COST. IT UNTIL -- DURING THE LIFETIME YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THIS IS THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO BE. AND THAT'S TRUE IN SO MANY OTHER AREAS WHERE WE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE INTERVENTION OF THE PREVENTION EARLY ON SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY. IN THE END THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SPEAKING ON THIS ISSUE. ALL RIGHT -- ISSUE -- FOR PUBLIC COMMENT I AM SO SORRY. I'M GLAD I HAVE SOMEBODY TO REMIND ME HELP. GOOD AFTERNOON ADRIN CHILTON WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE WE WERE THE FOR YOUR COMMENT I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU -- MAYOR STEINBERG WAS HERE FOR THE LAST HEARING HIS TESTIMONY I WAS NOT PRESENT BUT OF COURSE I'VE I'VE LISTENED TO TO THE TAPE. WAS SO IMPORTANT AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY WAS DISCUSSED THEN -- I DO WANT TO THANK YOU AND AND THE INSTITUTE FOR THE WORK YOU DO THANK YOU SO MUCH -- IS A PERSONAL SAY THAT WERE INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED FOR EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMMING IN THE BUDGET WE WERE THE PROUD SPONSORS OF ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FIFTEEN AND ALSO. ARE SUPPORTING THE BILL THAT YOU MENTIONED THE AB SEVEN THIRTEEN WHICH HAS THAT FIX TO ALLOW STATE FUNDS TO BE DEPOSITED. FIRST TO KICK OFF THIS PROGRAM JUST TO ECHO THE THE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS HERE WE SEE NO REASON TO REINVENT THE WHEEL THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN DOING EXCELLENT WORK TO SET UP. THE PROGRAM AS OUTLINED UNDER AB THIRTEEN FIFTEEN IN FACT THEY'RE SENDING OUT LETTERS THIS WEEK TO THE EXPERT ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT'S OUT ONE IN THE BILL THAT WILL BE REVIEWING. THE APPLICATIONS THAT WILL BE COMING FROM THE COUNTIES -- AS YOU SAID WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO PREVENT MENTAL ILLNESS FROM BECOMING SEVERE AND DISABLING IN THESE PROGRAMS WORK. TWENTY TOLL IS MENTIONED THAT THE RESEARCH EFFECTIVE WE BEEN TALKING TODAY ABOUT THE RISING SUICIDE RATES THE RISING HOMELESSNESS NUMBERS AND THESE PROGRAMS GET TO YOUNG PEOPLE BEFORE. THEY BECOME HOMELESS AND BEFORE OTHER TRAGIC OUTCOME SO -- SUPPORT OF OF THE OF THE FUNDING AGAIN AND ALSO -- I REQUEST THAT WE ALIGN THE TWO PROGRAMS AND NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR BARBER GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I AM HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FOR THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION IS CERTAINLY WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO BE EMPHASIZING THESE DAYS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR MCDADE HANG ON BEHALF OF C. SACK THE STATUS CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WE ALSO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IN ALIGNING THE PROGRAMS WERE. AGNOSTIC UP AS TO WHERE THE PROGRAM LIVES -- BUT THERE HAS BEEN QUITE A BIT OF GOOD WORK DONE BY THE AC THUS FAR AND WHATEVER WILL EXPEDITE THE THE INTENT OF THREE ONE ONE FIVE WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL THANK YOU NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOR MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THANKS MADAM CHAIR MERRY CAN'T WILL DEPART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO I KNEW -- THERE WAS EXCELLENT RIGHT UP IN THE AGENDA AND SO THERE WERE PARTICULAR QUESTIONS I THINK YOU'RE ASKING BOTH US AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO ADDRESS SO -- I WILL TRY TO DO MY BEST TO ADDRESS THOSE AND ALSO BRENT AGREE LESS HERE WILL BE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AS WELL. SO. AS OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA WE DO HAVE A A SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN VARIOUS WAYS I KNOW THAT YOU ALL TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK -- THAT IS OPERATED BY THE COUNTIES. SPECIFICALLY THE MEDI CAL PIECES THEN ALSO OVERSEEN BY THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS THE SINGLE STATE MEDICAID AGENCY WE ALSO. OVERSEE THE REST OF ANY OTHER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED WHETHER THEY'RE THROUGH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE THROUGH OUR FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WITH RESPECT SPECIFICALLY TO MONITORING THE PERFORMANCE AND ACCESS OF THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS WE GET WE DO THINGS THAT WE DO A VARIETY OF THINGS WE DO ARE TRY ANNUAL. REVIEWS WHERE WE GO OUT AND ACT. WE CALL THEM REFUSED. SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM AN AUDIT. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE REVIEW SOUND NICER I'M NOT SURE -- THAT REALLY FOCUS ON ALL OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF ACCESS TIMELINESS OF SERVICES WHAT TYPES OF GRIEVANCES ARE HAPPENING -- CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC LINGUISTIC COMPETENCY. OUTRAGE PROCESS HE IS AS WELL AS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS NOT BE COUNTIES ART PROVIDING. IN ADDITION STARTING -- THIS YEAR. WE STARTED THE ANNUAL NETWORK RIGHT YEAH. FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YEAR IT IS ANYMORE I'M STARTING THIS YEAR THERE WAS A NEW REQUIREMENT TO DO ANNUAL NETWORK CERTIFICATION FOR THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. THIS WAS RELATED TO THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AROUND MANAGED CARE FROM A MEDICAID PERSPECTIVE -- WE HAVE HAD AS A STATE AS I AS YOU ALL KNOW A SPECIFIC NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO MANAGED CARE PLANS SO ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH SIDE. THAT HAS BEEN OPERATED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE BUT THE FEDERAL. CHOIR MEANT HAD US HAVE TO ADD THOSE ALSO IN THE MIDDLE HEALTH SIDE AND THEN A STEP A STATUTORY. PROVISION WAS PASSED LAST YEAR THAT LAID OUT EXACTLY WHAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS BEING MEASURED -- HOW COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND SO THAT WE ARE IN THE ESSENTIALLY THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THAT? OF THAT SORT OF FIRST FIRST CRACK AT AS I KNOW OUR DIRECTOR HAS SHAREDWITH THE COUNTIES AND OTHERS WE ARE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF LOOKING AT WHERE ARE COUNTIES IN COMING TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS THAT WE ISSUED. LAST JULY WHEN WE ORIGINALLY DID THE NETWORK CERTIFICATION AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE THAT REMAIN OUT OF COMPLIANCE WE WILL BE SHORTLY ISSUING SANCTIONS -- MONETARY SANCTIONS IN ORDER. TO CONTINUALLY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING HAVING ADEQUATE NETWORK. BUT SANCTIONS ARE ARE THINGS THAT WE USE CURRENTLY ON THE MANAGED CARE SIDE SO AGAIN TRYING TO ALIGN THE SYSTEM TO BE MUCH MORE SIMILAR IN THE WAY THAT WE OVERSEE THEM. IN ADDITION TO THAT AS REQUIRED FEDERALLY WE HAVE AN EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION. EACH ROW HOW WAS FORGET WHAT THE LETTERS STAND FOR SARS DON'T HAVE TO LOOK IT UP -- AND SO THAT COME TO MIND. WE ARE A LOT OF ACRONYMS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR SURE -- SO THE EAGER -- WITH AN EXTERNAL REVIEW THESE CRITICAL ISSUES AGAIN OF ACCESS. TIMELINESS COMPLAINTS CULTURAL COMPETENCY WHAT ARE THE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT THE COUNTIES ARE DOING SO THEY ARE INDEPENDENT FROM AUSTIN THAT THEY THEN GO OUT INTO THEIR OWN. ASSESSMENT OF THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES. AND THEN I WOULD SAY -- THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE ALSO JUST HAVE JUST OUR REGULAR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT PROCESS YOU SO. THE COUNTIES ARE OUR CONTRACTOR SO THEY ARE OUR HEALTH PLANS AND SO LIKE WE DO WITH MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS WE HAVE SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS THAT WE WORK WITH THE COUNTIES ON MAKING SURE THAT THEIR MEETING. AND AGAIN THOSE SORT OF RELATE ACROSS THE BOARD TO ACCESS QUALITY -- AND AND THE LIKE AND SO THAT THOSE WERE CONTINUING TO IMPROVE UPON AS RIVER CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES ON HOW TO BEST WORK TOGETHER. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE AS WELL AS THAT THE STATE LAW AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS REQUIRE -- BEFORE IT TURNED OVER TO BRENDA TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THE DASHBOARD THAT WE DO BECAUSE THAT IS I'D SAY THE OTHER WAY -- WE MONITOR ACCESS I WANTED TO JUST ADDRESS ONE OF THE OTHER -- KEY ISSUES THAT WAS RAISED IN THE AGENDA AND THAT IS THIS ISSUE OF THE BIFURCATED SYSTEM SO AS LEAD OUT AGAIN WE DO HAVE ESSENTIALLY MULTIPLE DELIVERY SYSTEMS THROUGH WHICH MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES ARE GETTING SERVICES TODAY. SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS WELL SUBSTANCE USED TO TOPIC OF NEXT WEEK'S HEARING. ARE SPECIFICALLY CARVED OUT TO THE COUNTIES TO TO OPERATE -- THERE ARE PLUSES AND MINUSES TO HAVING THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM AND I THINK WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO MOVE FORWARD. HOW DO WE BETTER INTEGRATE WHETHER IT SPECIFICALLY INTEGRATING OR FIGHTING BETTER LINKAGES BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS BECAUSE WHAT WE DO KNOW? END UP DIRECTOR KEPT THAT THAT A LOT. OF PEOPLE COME INTEGRATED RIGHT THEY COME INTO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE THEY COME INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY. THEY BRING THEIR OTHER ISSUES WITH THEM THEY DON'T JUST BRING MY DIABETES TO MY DOCTOR. AND MY DEPRESSION TO MY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND WAYS. TO IMPROVE THAT INTEGRATION ONE OF THOSE BEING A VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM THAT WE'RE INSTITUTING WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WILL FOCUS ON PROVIDING INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS WHO ARE DOING A CO LOCATION AND OTHER CLEAR INTEGRATION BETWEEN PRIMARY CARE AND AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- IN ADDITION AS MANY FOLKS HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AS WE COME UPON BOTH ARE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WEAVER RENEWAL. AND OUR RENEWAL OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH WAIVER IS HOW DO WE ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS PROGRAM IN A DIFFERENT WAY THE QUESTION I'VE CONTINUE TO POSE. TO TO FOLKS WHO ARE ADVISING US ON OUR STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEES IS IF WE WERE BUILDING THE SYSTEM TODAY WHAT SHOULD IT LOOK LIKE. I THINK WE ALL AGREE IT WOULD NOT LOOK LIKE IT DOES. AND OBVIOUSLY THINGS WERE CREATED FOR THE FOR VALID REASONS WHETHER IT WAS FINANCING WHETHER WITH GOVERNANCE -- AND ALL OVER THE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE YOU KNOW CREATED THIS PROGRAM IN A SPECIFIC WAY BUT WE WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THESE WAIVER RENEWALS TO REALLY ASK A QUESTION. ABOUT HOW DO WE DO IT BETTER SO WE'RE REALLY COUNTY PARTNERS AND OUR PROVIDER PARTNERS ALL OF WHOM PARTICIPATED BAD ABOUT A STAKE HOLDER GROUP LAST YEAR THAT STARTED ASKING THESE QUESTIONS AND WILL BE COMING BACK OUT WITH -- ADDITIONAL. SORRY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS LATER THIS YEAR. AND THEN I JUST HAVE BRENDA TALK ABOUT THE DASHBOARD THAT WE STORY OUT FOR THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DASHBOARD -- SO WE HAVE -- DASHBOARDS FOR THE ENTIRE AGE SPAN SO CHILDREN IN YEARS ALL THE WAY THROUGH ADULT OLDER ADULTS AND WE PROVIDE DATA ON OUR WEBSITE -- RELATED TO YOU AYE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AS WELL AS WHAT WE CALL OUR PENETRATION RATES IN OUR ENGAGEMENT RATES AND THIS WAS DEVELOPED WITH STAKEHOLDERS ARM AND ARE COUNTY PARTNERS -- OUR PENETRATION RATE IS ONE OR MORE SERVICES IN OUR ENGAGEMENT RATE IS FIVE OR MORE SERVICES THESE NUMBERS WERE DEVELOPED OUT THROUGH A QUITE A PROCESS LOOKING AT ARE DATED AND FIGURE OUT THE PROPER CUT OFFS -- AND SO IT HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND OUR POPULATION TO UNDERSTAND WHO'S COMING INTO THE SYSTEM AND WHO'S STAYING IN OUR SYSTEM -- WE ALSO PROVIDES DATA ON THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT PEOPLE ARE UTILIZING AND HOW MUCH OF THE CERTAIN THE STRUGGLE SERVICES THERE UTILIZING AS WELL AS THE COST FOR THOSE SERVICES. AND THEN -- WHAT WE DO AT THIS POINT HAVE -- ONE HE JUST MEASURE AND I DON'T HAVE A TIME FOR FOLLOW UP AFTER SOMEBODY'S -- HOSPITALIZED WHETHER BE A CHILD ARE YOU OR ADULTS OR OLDER ADULT AND WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD OUT OUR DASH FOR WE'RE CONTINUOUSLY KIND OF ITS OWN -- WORKING PARTNERS WERE CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING OUR DASHBOARDS -- AS WE GET MORE DATA AS WE IMPROVE OUR DATA QUALITY WERE PUBLISHING DATA EVERY YEAR SO I WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD OUT THOSE -- THOSE DASHBOARDS -- AND WE ALSO -- COLLECT CONSUMER PERCEPTION SURVEY FROM -- SERVICE FROM MARK -- THE PEOPLE WHO WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT SINCE THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS AND WE DO THAT TWICE A YEAR AND WE ALSO PUBLISH THAT DATE ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL. I THINK WE ADDRESS SORT OF THE MAIN THINGS THAT WERE FOCUSED AS I KNOW THAT THERE ARE COUNTY PARTNERS OBVIOUSLY HAVE ADDITIONAL THINGS I'M SURE THEY WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU RIGHT I THINK THAT YOU'VE COVERED MANY THE EQ ARE -- AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS I THINK -- YOU KNOW THE NETWORK ADEQUACY TOOL THAT WERE ALL COMPLETED I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO OF A WORK FOR SHORTAGE OF OUR FIELD ACROSS CALIFORNIA. EVEN IN LARGE COUNTIES IT DOESN'T MATTER -- AND SO IT'S VERY CHALLENGING AND I THINK THE COUNTIES WORKING WITH DH CS. ARE REALLY LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE BRING IN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF STAFF. BECAUSE WE NEED FOR THE EVIDENCE BASED. ALL THE EVIDENCE FACE WORKING FOR A PSYCHIATRIST THOSE ARE LIKE JEWELS IN THE CROWN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHETHER THEIR CONTRACT AGENCIES ARE COUNTY OPERATED. THAT WERE USING THE CLINICAL STAFF OF THE APPROACH BUT THERE IS A SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF EFFORTS MADE ON THIS I'M FOR MANY YEARS SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE MHSAA. BUT IT DOES MAKE THE NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS VERY CHALLENGING FOR MANY OF THE COUNTIES -- TELEHEALTH WILL BE MOVING TOWARDS TELEHEALTH AT ALL THAT. I THINK A COUPLE OF MY OTHER U. S. M. -- SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT -- DO WE HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING IN THE COUNTY AND I THINK THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO ANSWER. I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M A QUICK TO SAY THIS IS THE SITUATION FOR ALL COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT. THE COUNTIES BASED ON SLICE OFTEN -- IN A LARGER COUNTIES HAVE MORE MORE REVENUE OFF AND THEN THE SMALLER COUNTIES SO I THINK WE IF YOU WERE TO LOOK ACROSS THE STATE YOU MIGHT HEAR FROM SOME COUNTIES WE NEED MORE FUNDING. AND I THINK FROM THE LARGER COUNTIES I THINK MAYBE WE ARE ALWAYS ASKING FOR MANY AT ALL THE COUNTIES BUT QUITE HONESTLY I THINK FOR MANY OF US IN THE LARGER COUNTIES WE HAVE OTHER FUNDING STREAMS AS WELL. SO I DON'T FEEL PREPARED TO REPRESENT ALL THE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA MR SUFFICIENT FUNDING -- I THINK THE THE OTHER THING THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT ACCESS WHICH WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT BUT IT'S ALSO HOW CAN WE MOVE THIS SOME I KNOW THAT'S THE INCENTIVE CONVERSATION. BUT HOW COOLEY MOVE THIS FORWARD NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF ACCESS BUT WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS ON THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. LIKE ARE THEY DOING BETTER ARE THEY LIVING IN A HOUSE. ARE THEY NOT SYMPTOMATIC WHEN A LOOK WE WANT TO WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT A GREAT DEAL ON REALLY MEASURING NEED AND ALSO MEASURING OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE -- AND I JUST THINK THE OTHER THING IS OUR FUNDING IS VERY COMPLEX WE PRAYED SEVERAL FUND FUNDING SOURCES EVERY COUNTY ASKED TO DO THIS. AND I KNOW THAT SEE BEACH DA IS VERY INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT. ON LOOKING AT SORT OF BILLING AND PAYMENT REFORM TO MAKE IT MUCH EASIER. TO JUST GIVE YOU A SMALL EXAMPLE I KNOW IT'S LATE AND PEOPLE ARE TIRED BUT WE BUILD BY THE MIDDLE. WE BILLED BY THE MINUTE AND CAN YOU IMAGINE -- DOCUMENTING BY THE MINUTE IN ORDER TO GET PAID THAT'S A LONG STANDING PRACTICE WITH OUR SHORT DIAL MEDI CAL. SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY WITH THE WAY FIRST I MEAN TOTALLY FOR US TO RETHINK THIS WORKING AND I ALSO THINK GOING FORWARD INTO THE WAY PERSON TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT SHOULD BE INTERESTING. THE LAST THING I DO WANT TO SAY ABOUT MILD TO MODERATE. AND BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS FOR THE COUNTIES -- THE MILD MODERATE TO THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT MIGHT BE HAVING ANXIETY THEY MAY NEED TO TALK TO A THERAPIST FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME OR THEY MAY NEED. MORE CARE THAN JUST BEYOND THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THE CONTRACT WITH US TO THE CONTRACT WITH INDEPENDENT PROVIDERS AND IT DOES BECOME VERY COMPLICATED WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. INTEGRATED CARE FULLY INTEGRATED CARE AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AT LEAST IN OUR COUNTY IS COULD WE TRY TO PILOTS THAT HOLD CONTINUE ON AND REALLY MANAGE PEOPLE FROM MILD TO MODERATE ALL THE WAY UP TO THE INTENSIVE. BECAUSE IF WE REALLY ARE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE BODY BEING INTEGRATED IT'S IT IS BIFURCATED RIGHT NOW JUST IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS. SO I NEED TO SAY THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MENTOR MEMBERS TO BE DEALING WITH NOW COMMISSION SO -- THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE WE'RE BIFURCATED IN TERMS OF THE ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT OR OFF THE COMMISSION -- UNDER THE LAW WE WRITE REGULATIONS -- FOR TWO OF TWO OF THE FIVE COMPONENTS OF THE MILL HALL SERVICES ACT PRIMARILY PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION AND INNOVATION. AND SO GETTING AT THE QUESTION OF HOW DO WE TO THE MONITOR ACCESS ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH CARE -- A AND IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY TO THE SPECIAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE SIDE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. IS HIS BEING SERVED TO WHICH PROGRAMS AND HOW AND WHEN AND WHERE ARE THEIR BREAKDOWNS BY RACE ETHNICITY AGE GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION. SO THE COMMISSION TO ITS REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAS ACTUALLY REQUIRED COUNTIES TO PROVIDE DATA. ON WHOSE ACTUALLY SERVED BY PROGRAM SO -- TRACTOR TELL THESE MENTIONED THAT THEY DO THESE PLANS AND THOSE PLANS ARE PROJECTIONS OF WHAT WHO THEY INTEND TO SERVE AND HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'LL INVEST IN THOSE PROGRAMS. ARE INTENSE WEDNESDAY'S DATA COME IN AS TO BE IS TO ACTUALLY MAKE PUBLIC WHO ACTUALLY HAS BEEN SERVED. SO BUT IT'S LIMITED ONLY TO PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND INNOVATION PROGRAMS BECAUSE THAT'S THE EXTENT OF AUTHORITY. THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR HAS THE REST OF THE YOU KNOW THE THE PIE CHART SO TO SPEAK -- BUT THE QUESTION IS REALLY ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE LAW AND SO WE WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN'T ACTUALLY TELL YOU OR REPORT OUT TO THE PUBLIC OF WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB. AROUND NOT JUST ACCESS TO CARE FOR THE QUALITY OF THAT CARE UNLESS WE CAN UNDERSTAND FIRST HIS HIS WALKING IN FRONT DOOR. AND SO THAT'S THE DEMOGRAPHIC REPORTING PIECE THAT WE HOPE THE BILL TO GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE OF WHO IS ACTUALLY BEING SERVED BUT ALSO WHAT ARE THOSE OUTCOMES ON ON THE BACKEND AND SO UNDER THE LAW AS SPECIFIED UNDER. THE MEN HOW SERVICES ACT IT SAYS REDUCE SCHOOL FAILURE REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT REDUCE. CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT SUICIDE HOMELESSNESS AND AND THEN THIS THIS GRANT PROLONGED SUFFERING AND SO. WE HAVE SEVERAL PROJECTS UNDER WAY TO LINK MENTAL HEALTH DATA WITH CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA FOR EXAMPLE TO ACTUALLY GIVE YOUR PROFILE BY COUNTIES OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE ACTUALLY ACCESSING OUR PUBLIC SERVICES THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE THAT NUMBER NEEDS TO COME DOWN. RIGHT AND IN PART OF OUR CHALLENGE QUITE FRANKLY IS NGUYEN AT LEAST WHEN THE COMMISSION THINKS ABOUT PREVENTION OR INTERVENTION WE'RE THINKING MARTHA POPULATION HEALTH LEVEL. NOT BASED ON THE FUNDING STREAM. RIGHT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY HOW DO WE ACTUALLY REDUCE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER NOT YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR AND I'M HERE IN THE MEDICAID MANAGED. MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM OR THE FEE FOR SERVICE PROGRAM OR THE COMMERCIAL PLAN OR NOT INSURED AT ALL THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IS VERY BROAD AND IT AND IT REALLY TALKS ABOUT. BROAD POPULATION LEVEL ISSUES NOT BASED ON HIS ELIGIBLE FOR A FUNDING STREAM. SO WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW CAN WE ACCESS EXISTING DATA AND BEGIN TO GIVE YOU SOME OF THOSE. IN THE CORE INFORMATION THAT THAT THAT MY COMMISSIONS WANNA KNOW. OUR CHILDREN ADULTS SAFE ARE THEY HOUSE THAT THEY WORKING OF THE SEATING YOU KNOW THOSE THIS THIS CORE ISSUES AND THEN B ABLE TO DRILL DOWN UNDERNEATH THAT WHAT KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS WHAT KINDS OF PROGRAMS. ARE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE AT ACHIEVING THOSE OUTCOMES. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE STATE HAS THE TECHNOLOGY THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE DATA AND THE AND THE THE ABILITY TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS WHEN I ANSWERING THEM NOW WE ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE INCENTIVES. AND THE GUIDANCE TO ACTUALLY HELP COUNTIES TO YOU KNOW HIGHLIGHT WHERE THERE'S EXCELLENCE HIGHLIGHT WHERE THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES AND AND MOVE DOLLARS MOVE STRATEGIES MOVE PROGRAMS FROM. LESS EFFECTIVE TOMORROW EFFECTIVE KINDS OF APPROACHES. IN TERMS OF THE SUFFICIENT PEACE AMID TO SAY 25% OF THE MONEY. OF THE OF THE FOUR PRIMARY CATEGORIES OF FUNDS AND ME TO SAY THE PAPER ALL SUB ACCOUNT REALIGNMENT FROM NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND THE FOURTH IS THE MEDI CAL DRIVE DOWN THE MEDICAL DROUGHT AND THE ONLY ONE THAT ACTUALLY COUNTIES IN THE STATE HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER HOW MUCH. MONEY EVERYTHING ELSE IS A FORMULA BASED ON REVENUES SO WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO BUY MORE CARS AND AND THAT PAY MORE. YOU KNOW VEHICLE LICENSE FEES WE CAN GROW THOSE REVENUE STREAMS -- BUT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN THE STATE MAXIMIZE THE BOTH THE DRAWDOWN OF ALL OF THE SOURCES OF FUNDS BUT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE EFFICACY OF THOSE DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING DEPLOYED. LASTLY I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION NUMBER -- FIVE BECAUSE WE DON'T WE DON'T WORK WITH THAT WE KNOW WE THE OTHER QUESTIONS REALLY AREN'T TO TOWARDS THE DEPARTMENT IS IN TERMS OF PROP FIFTY THREE FUNDING. I WOULD SAY THERE ARE TWO FOUNDATIONAL IMPACTS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE ONE IS A MANDATE FOR PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN THE OTHER. OTHER FUNDING SOURCES FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT'S THAT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY ALLOWS SANTA CLARA COUNTY CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. MENDOCINO COUNTY TO ACTUALLY FOR KINDS OF PROGRAMS. THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE INNOVATION FUNDS IT'S A 5% SET ASIDE IT COMES OUT TO ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT THE COUNTIES RECEIVE. WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS THAT IS THE LAW CREATES AN EXPECTATION THAT COUNTIES WILL IMPROVE. AND IT CREATES A REVENUE STREAM TO SUPPORT THAT IMPROVEMENT THROUGH INNOVATION. WE'RE DOING A LOT TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF COUNTY IS TO ACTUALLY DEPLOY THOSE DOLLARS IN WAYS THAT INNOVATION IMPROVED YOUR CORE PROGRAMS. BUT IT'S AN AREA THAT WE NEED TO INVEST MORE AND MORE TIME OR RESOURCES MORE STRATEGIES BECAUSE AGAIN I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS. THE EXPERTISE THE KNOWLEDGE THE CAPACITY TO REALLY KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK WHEN IT COMES TO INNOVATION. BUT WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SOME GOOD AND UNDERSTANDABLE SOME NOT SO GOOD AND NOT SO UNDERSTANDABLE -- BUT HAPPY. TO TALK SOME MORE ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR TAKE ON THIS BROADER ISSUE OF HOW DO WE ENSURE PEOPLE GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED -- IN BEFORE YOU ASK A QUESTION. WE DO HAVE ANOTHER PANELIST MACHEL CABRERA CAN WE IF THERE'S SOMEONE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE SPEAKING A WHOLE LOT THANK YOU RYAN. THANK YOU RYAN. OUR GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MASAK UPDATED WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES UNION AND I AM HERE PROUD TO REPRESENT THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE. OUR WORKERS -- COURTNEY AND DELIVER DIRECT SERVICES FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS WELL AS SOME OF THE CONTRACTED PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE TODAY IN TEACHING THAT THEY BRING TO THEIR WORK IS NOT SORT OF ARE YOU MEDI CAL ARE YOU NON MEDIC HOW THEY ARE REALLY LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL -- AND THEIR THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS AND DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE HELP THEY NEED. ARE -- TEAMS CONSIST OF A RANGE OF WORKERS FROM UNLICENSED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TO LICENSED PROFESSIONALS INCLUDING. SOCIAL WORKERS MAKE MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST PSYCHOLOGIST AT CETERA AND WE HARNESS ARE SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOSOCIAL MODELS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. I THINK THERE'S THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS THE ROUTE ABOUT SORT OF THE THE COMPARISONS WITH THE DD SYSTEM AND WE'VE CERTAINLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AS WELL -- IN THE SENSE THAT PART OF WHAT RAY THINK THE TENSION IS HERE WHAT WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH HIS WERE TRYING TO OVERLAY A MEDICAL MODEL ON TOP OF SOMETHING THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT. AND THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE DRAWN FROM THE DD MODEL IN THE SENSE THAT WITH THIS COMMUNITY THERE WILL BE INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE WITH US. FROM WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTY BEEN HUMANS ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THEIR END OF LIFE AND SO -- WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO SEE WHERE THERE ARE SIMILARITIES THERE AND WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT -- TRYING TO OVER SIMPLIFY THINGS CONCEPTS SUCH AS NETWORK ADEQUACY YOU KNOW FOR ANYONE WHO'S EVER HAD TO SEEK OUT OF THERAPY YOU KNOW THAT IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS WHEN YOU GO. TO SEE A DOCTOR AND OR OR YOU KNOW AT AND OR OR ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON -- YOU KNOW WHOMEVER YOU JUST WANT SOME -- SEEKING MEANT AT CONNECTS DAYS IN WEEKS THAT OUR WORKERS SPEND CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE AND GETTING THEM TO TRUST THEM AND HAVING THAT REAL HUMAN CONNECTION. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN MEASURE WITH TIME OR DISTANCE STANDARDS AND SO WE WOULD JUST SORT OF URGE SOME CAUTION IN HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT OF COMPARING THE TWO MODELS. THE OTHER THING THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ABOUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IS. UNLIKE THE MEDICAL MODEL WE DON'T HAVE THESE REALLY BIG LONG STANDING ORGAN DATE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED THESE REALLY INTRICATE QUALITY MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS YOU KNOW. AND SO YOU KNOW ON HEALTH CARE SAID YOU SEE CMS IN THE DO READMISSIONS PENALTIES WERE THE THING YOU FINANCIALLY IF SOMEBODY COMES OUT OF THE HOSPITAL GOES RIGHT BACK IN. BUT IN ADDICTION RECOVERY. RELAPSE IS A PART OF THE PROCESS AND SO THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD THINK ABOUT DOING IN SOMEBODY BECAUSE SOMEONE RELAPSE THAT MEANS POTENTIALLY THAT THEY'RE GETTING BETTER RIGHT SO. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WERE YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS AND WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK MAYBE AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE REALLY NEED WHICH IS BACK PROVIDER LEVEL INTEGRATION. WHEN OUR WORKERS ARE TRYING TO FIND PLACEMENTS FOR FOLKS TO DAY? THEY HAVE. OWNED SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BOTH PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS SO THE DIABETIC WHO NEEDS RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. THE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROVIDER CAN'T DEAL WITH THE DAY. THE INPATIENT HOSPITAL BED. THEY DON'T DEAL WITH THE YOU KNOW. SOCIAL EMOTIONAL THEY DON'T DO THE DECK ADDICTION STUFF AND SO THEY'RE REALLY ALWAYS STRUGGLING TO FIND. WHAT WHERE CAN I FIND SOMETHING AND IF WE THINK IT'S BETTER ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE BECAUSE THERE WAS A LINE IN THE AGENDA THAT TALKED ABOUT THE FEDERAL RULES? TO MAKE SURE TO IT'S AS GOOD AS THE COMMERCIAL SYSTEM. IT'S NOT BETTER IN THE COMMERCIAL SYSTEM IT'S OFTEN WORSEN THE KERR COMMERCIAL SYSTEM OUR FOLKS ARE HAPPY WHEN SOMEONE QUALIFIES FOR MEDI CAL BECAUSE THE BENEFITS THERE ARE SO MUCH BETTER CAN BE MUCH BETTER THERE AS WELL. AND SO YOU KNOW THE OTHER FILTERING OUT THE PROVIDERS DO AGAIN WHEN WE CAN GET OVER THE NIMBY HURDLES WHEN WE CAN ACTUALLY SITE PROVIDERS. YOU KNOW THEY'LL SAY WE DON'T TAKE SOMEBODYWHO'S A SEX OFFENDER WE DON'T TAKE SOMEONE WITH AN ARSON CONVICTION WELL AGAIN WHO DO WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE TRYING TO SERVE IF WE'RE GOING. TO GET THROUGH ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES LIKE HOMELESSNESS AND SO -- OUR WORKERS ARE REALLY. I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE IN SORT OF THE NEW ONES AND THE GRANULARITY THAT THEY BRING TO THESE CONVERSATIONS -- WHERE WE DO THINK WE NEED TO GO WHERE WE THINK THERE'S -- PROMISE AND HOPE FOR US IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS SO MUCH INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC AND WE THINK THAT -- WE NEED TO DO A LOT MORE ITSELF I WANT TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT ARGUING FOR THE STATUS QUO HERE WE NEED TO DO A LOT MORE IN TERMS OF LEVERAGING THE COUNTY'S EXPERTISE. WE NEED. TO BE MINDFUL THAT COUNTIES ARE INTEGRATING ACROSS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS EDUCATION SOCIAL SERVICES CHILD WELFARE HOMELESS. JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND SO THERE IS AN INTEGRATION POINT THAT GOES BEYOND THE PHYSICAL HEALTH DIMENSION. AND WE NEED DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION WHICH WILL REQUIRE INVESTMENT IN DOING THAT TRANSFORMATION IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN NECESSARILY ON THE NATURAL -- WHAT WE DID WITH WHOLE PERSON CARE PELLETS THAT'S GREAT WE NEED MORE OF THAT AND WE NEED STATEWIDE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT PLAN? OUT SOMETHING THAT GO CUTS ACROSS THE PATCHWORK IN THE INDIVIDUAL KIND OF ONE OFF HERE AND THERE AND THAT LOOKS SORT OF MACRO STATEWIDE -- SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING. TO HAVE A COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR WATCH WHAT SET OF SERVICES SHOULD COUNTIES BE DELIVERING WHAT DOES THAT COMMUNITY BASED CONTINUE OF CARE LOOK LIKE -- YOU KNOW FROM LEASE RESTRICT TWO LOCKED BEDS AND HOW MUCH DO WE NEED OF EACH BECAUSE IF WE START INVESTING IN ONE THING HAPHAZARD WE NEED MORE LOCKED BEDS THEY WERE GONNA BUILD BLACK BEDS AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO END UP AND MARK THAT EVEN IF THEY DON'T NEED. THAT RIGHT SO WE NEED TO HAVE EVERYTHING THERE -- OUR WORK DOES GO FAR BEYOND THE WALLS OF THE CLINIC OR ANY PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL OUR MEMBERS ARE OUT IN COMMUNITIES THEY ARE ON SKID ROW THEY ARE -- IN THE FIELD AND OUR WORK DOES GO BEYOND ELIGIBILITY CLASSIFICATIONS. OR EVEN THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF OUR CONSUMERS WE TAKE THEM TO GET THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSES WE TAKE THEM. TO FILL OUT APPLICATIONS FOR SSI SO THAT THEY CAN GET BACK UP ON THEIR FEET. AND WHERE THE SAFETY NET FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING WITH BOTH MENTAL ILLNESS AS WELL AS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER NEEDS WE CAN'T FORGET THAT WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH IT WE'RE ALSO DEALING WITH THEIR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN IT AND SO. WITH YOUR HELP WE CAN DO A LOT MORE TO MODERNIZE THE SYSTEM TO CREATE AN APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES WHERE THE NATIONAL STANDARDS DON'T NECESSARILY EXISTS TO WERE CREATING SOMETHING WHOLE CLOTH BRAND NEW. AND THAT MAKES SENSE FOR WHERE WE WANT TO EVENTUALLY SEE -- OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM MEET PEOPLE'S NEEDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I THINK. YOUR COMMENT AT THE BEGINNING BOOTS ON THE GROUND. THERE SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY. MEETING WITH THE PATIENTS OR SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY SPEAKING WITH THEM SITE I I I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK THE TERM MEMBERS DO IN THIS AREA I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT -- COMMENTS QUESTIONS YES DOCTOR WITH. FOR PERSONAL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AT AS WELL AND WE HAD TO HEARINGS ON ON THE MEDI CAL -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- JUST AND X. AND I'M UNFORTUNATELY LOT MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE BIFURCATED SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE -- AND NOT AND NOT TERRIBLY THRILLED ABOUT IT OBVIOUSLY -- THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS -- ACTUALLY RELATED IN AND MAYBE AS A COUNTY YOU CAN YOU CAN HELP ME. SO TODAY I MET WITH -- COUNTY GOES -- SO SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS FROM ONE OF MY DISTRICTS AND UNFORTUNATELY -- IT THE NATURE RURAL DISTRICT YOU HAVE THIRTY TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND IN ONE OF MY COUNTIES AND SO NOT LIKE LA NOT LIKE SACRAMENTO MICHAEL OF THESE BUT AND THEY THEY ARE ALL UNIFORMLY STRUGGLING WITH -- MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AS WE LOOK AT SUICIDE PREVENTION WITH ALL THESE THINGS WE DON'T HAVE. ENOUGH PEOPLE IN SCHOOLS THAT CAN HELP WITH THIS SPEAKER AND AND THAT IS A PLACE WHERE WE'RE CHILDREN INTERFACE ON A DAILY BASIS TYPICALLY AND AND AND SCHOOLS AND SO EARLY INTERVENTION IN SCHOOLS ISN'T THERE SO JUST. DOES THE COUNTY INTERACT WITH AS AN ENTITY INTERACT WITH THE SCHOOLS ON THIS AND IT IS. THE THE THE SO YOU WORKING TOGETHER ON ON THESE PROGRAMS AND IS NOT TYPICAL. THERE ARE MANY MANY OF THE COUNTIES HAVE SCHOOL SERVICES SCHOOLING SERVICES. AND DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY WE FUND POSITIONS THAT MAY BE COMMUNITY BASED PEOPLE -- WE HAVE THE IN OUR SHOP WE HAVE US THE MANAGERS AND STAFF THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE CONTRACTED OUT TO COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS. AND I KNOW THAT ACROSS THE STATE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO SAY MEETING WITH THE DIRECTORS THIS IS SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE ALL TRYING TO DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW CAN THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL STAFFING WITHIN THE SCHOOL SETTINGS THE SCHOOLS ARE ASKING THE DEPARTMENTS. TO PROVIDE MORE STAFF -- TO PROVIDE MORE TRAINING WE'RE NOW WORKING WITH -- FROM ELEMENTARY MIDDLE HIGH SCHOOL AND NOW THE COLLEGES ARE ALSO RESET REACHING OUT TO US SO I THINK THERE'S HI HIGH DEMAND. AND FOR THE COMMUNITIES LIKE YOUR SMALL COUNTIES I THINK IT'S REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR THE SMALL COUNTIES IS IT I THINK IT'S TRAIN THE TRAINER -- I ALSO THINK THAT WE LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO TRAIN PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHO COULD COME IN AND BE IN THE VERY POSITIONS THAT WE'RE DESCRIBING HERE. WE HAVE COUNSELORS COMMUNITY WORKERS THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SERVICE THAT DON'T REQUIRE LICENSING WHO COULD DO THE KIND OF WORK THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT A YEAR COUNTIES SO I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF FACTORS -- BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY. IF IF I MASON AND THE COMMISSION ACTUALLY WENT UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND ENGAGE THE COUNTIES ON IT RELATED TO ISSUES ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT INNOVATION. BUT WE CAME AWAY WITH SORT OF THREE FUNDAMENTAL REQUEST FROM THE COUNTIES FIRST THEY WANNA KNOW EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING. RIGHT BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW I MEAN THEY ENGAGE AT THE DIRECTOR LEVEL THEY ENGAGE IN. BUT THEY ACTUALLY ASKED COULD WE COULD THE STATE CREATES A CLEARING. OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS ARE IN PLACE. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE SCHOOL THE ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH IN THE SCHOOLS. AND SECOND THEY ASKED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT IF THEY FIND SOMETHING THAT THEY THINK WILL WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITY. WHERE THEY TURN FOR HELP AND SO CAN THE STATE ACTUALLY FACILITATE? THE LEARNING. CROSS COUNTY ENGAGEMENT AND THE THIRD PIECE THEY SAID IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BREAK AWAY SOME SPECIALLY FOR SMALL COUNTIES FROM THEIR CORE OPERATIONS FUNDING TO TRY TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW. AND SO CAN THE STATE PROVIDES SOME AND SEND GET PROGRAMS OFF THE GROUND PARTICULARLY IF THROUGH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THERE'S ENGAGEMENT AROUND HOW THEY CAN SUSTAIN. THAT IT'S NOT A GOOD NOT AT NOT A ONE TIME GRANT THAT THEN GOES AWAY BUT AN INVESTMENT IN A STRATEGY WHERE THEY LEARN TO MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE USING OTHER REVENUE SOURCES. EITHER BY INCREASING THEIR DRAW DOWN A FEDERAL MONEY BY MOVING DOLLARS FROM LESS EFFECTIVE TOMORROW EFFECTIVE OR SOME OTHER APPROACH. SO WE WE TO SEE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN MONTEREY IN SANTA CLARA IN PLASTER IN RIVERSIDE WHERE WHERE WHERE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS AND LOCAL SCHOOLS AND AND THEIR PARTNERS THAT ARE PROVIDING SERVICES. HAVE ACTUALLY FIGURED OUT DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THINGS AND WHAT'S REALLY EXCITING ABOUT THAT IS IS NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL. IN SOME PLACES THERE'S NINE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES IN SOME COMMUNITIES IT'S IT'S A COUPLE AND WHAT THE STATE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW DO WE ACTUALLY SUPPORT. MANY MANY APPROACHES TO FIGURE OUT. SIMULTANEOUSLY DOING THAT RESEARCH WORK TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH FOR HOME IN WHAT SCENARIO IN WHAT COMMUNITY. BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE IT NEEDS TO BE A STATEWIDE STRATEGY. THAT ALLOWS EACH COUNTY TO TAILOR IT TO TO WHAT'S THE WHAT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THEIR COMMUNITY. I AND I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE THE WORK FORCES AT SUCH A HUGE PART OF THIS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION HAVE THEIR WORKFORCE COMMISSION. A YEAR AND A HALF OF OF MEETINGS -- AND RECOMMENDATIONS -- THERE IS A THERE IS THERE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS AND AND AND AND AN ESTIMATE OF FUNDING FOR THAT BUT WE DON'T WE ME THE WILL TO ACTUALLYGO FOR WITH THAT AND A BIG COMPONENT OF THAT WAS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND SO WE WE HAVE TO HAVE TO DO THAT -- JUST. COME TO KEEP PLUGGING AWAY AT THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE THE WORK FORCE IS IS IS ONE OF THE HUGE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING. THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AND IT OBVIOUSLY VARIES FROM PLACE TO PLACE BUT IT'S A IT'S IT'S THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT WE HAVE. SO I THINK THEM THERE'S DIFFERENT MODELS THAT WE'RE LOOKING UP BECAUSE IN CONTRA COSTA WE HAVE A COUNTY HOSPITAL. IT HAS A MENTAL HEALTH CAPACITY SOLANO COUNTY RAIL ALSO REPRESENT DOES NOT. IN THIS PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN THAT DOES IF YOU WOULD. END. A ONE OF THAT GOES [inaudible] TO THE HOSPITAL'S. FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS IF THEY THEY RECORD OR WHATEVER AND AFTER THAT IF THERE'S NO ROOM IN THE CRISIS BEDS. THE PROJECT. SO MEDICAL NOT BUILD. THE COUNTIES BUILT ON ANOTHER LEVEL OF HOUSING THESE PEOPLE. OKAY. AND THEN WHEN I LOOK AT AND AGAIN IN THE MEDI CAL STRUCTURE. ARE WE STILL HAVING PROBLEMS WITH PROVIDERS. IN THE MET MEDI CAL WORLD OF CREAM THE LESS REIMBURSEMENT RATE THEM. THEN THE THE PRACTITIONERS OR OR OR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS ACTUALLY CHARGE. ARE WEAK CONSTRAINING OURSELVES AND GETTING. A LESSER AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE OF MEDI CAL. YOU KNOW AND THEN WHAT IS A DETERRENT. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE H. M. O.'S P. PO'S THAT AREN'T STEPPING UP TO DO. I MEAN I HEAR. ONE IN PARTICULAR NOW IS STARTING TO LOOK AT IT AND AND IDENTIFYING THE NEED. FOR A LARGER IT'S A MOST -- BUT THERE'S NOT OTHERS THAT ARE NOT STEPPING UP THEIR NOT RECOGNIZING THE ISSUE. AND IT IN IT FALLS INTO. IS THE COUNTY OR SOMEBODY ELSE'S LAP. SO I KNOWS OF A BUNCH OF POINTS OF QUESTIONS BUT YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW FIRST IS THE MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE CORRECT. FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BECAUSE I HAVE. GENERAL PRACTITIONERS WE WON'T ACCEPT THE MEDICAL PATIENT. SURE SO I I THINK A FEW THINGS TO TRY TO ADDRESS YOUR POINTS AND CERTAINLY LET ME KNOW IF I'M MISSING ANYTHING WITH RESPECT TO THE REIMBURSEMENT -- ON THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SIDE IN THE SUBURBS YOU SIDE -- WE WE DON'T DIRECTOR THE COUNTIES IN TERMS OF THE RATES THAT THEY WOULD SET IT LATE WHATEVER THEIR COST AND THAT BEING. WE ARE YOU KNOW THAT CAN BE CERTIFIED IN AND DRAWN DOWN IN TERMS OF FEDERAL FUNDS SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE PHYSICAL HEALTH. GREAT CONVERSATION FOR JUST THAT JUST TO CLARIFY THAT -- SO THAT'S REALLY SORT OF A COUNTY AND AGAIN I THINK YOU HEARD OF MICHELLE TALK ABOUT AND OTHERS THERE'S A COMBINATION OF CONTRACTED PROVIDERS AND ACTUALLY COUNTY. SORT COUNTY TO COUNTY STAFF THEMSELVES TO IN SOME WAYS YOU CAN'T REALLY SORT OF IDENTIFIED AS EASILY BECAUSE AGAIN SOMETIMES THESE ARE JUST COUNTY AND AND AND AND MANY COUNTIES ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER ARE ACTUALLY EMPLOYED BY THE COUNTY AND SO NOT PAID. SORT OF ON A SERVICE BASIS AND NOT PAID FOR MEDI CAL DIFFERENT THAN -- YOU KNOW AND ANOTHER TYPE OF PROVIDE US INDIVIDUAL SO JUST TO CLARIFY THAT IT IS NOT IT IS. UNIQUE TO THE MEDI CAL. DELIVERY STRUCTURE I THINK THE THE OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE REALLY SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE OF THE BIFURCATION THAT OUR STATE HAS SET UP IN TERMS OF THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION BUT IT'S LIMITED IT'S LIMITED TO THOSE WITH WHAT WE STAY MILD TO MODERATE WHICH IS NOT. LIKE DIAGNOSIS SPECIFIC IT'S NOT. CLEAR CUT AND I THINK THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS INTRODUCED A FAIRLY RECENTLY WITH WITH THE ACA SO IT'S IT'S STILL. YOU KNOW IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THAT -- IN TERMS OF THAT WORK AND I THINK WE'VE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE PLANS AND THE COUNTIES TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HAVING PEOPLE WHO ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS OF DOUGH. PLANS RESPONSIBLE NO COUNTIES RESPONSIBLE AND WE CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY IS WHEN THOSE ISSUES COME UP ABOUT HELPING THEM IDENTIFY. IS THE PLAN IS THAT THE PLANS OBLIGATION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PAYING THEM TO DO OR IS IT THE COUNTIES OBLIGATION AND SO I THINK THAT GOES TO THAT FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM. AND AGAIN FROM THE WORK THAT WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS WITH OUR HEALTH PLANS WITH OUR YOU KNOW STATE WORK FORCE IN TERMS OF HOW SHOULD WE BE DELIVERING THIS CARE WE KNOW WE'RE NOT DELIVERING IT THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW. SO CAN WE FIND A WAY WITH IN THE OTHER FOR OVERLAYING PIECE THAT IS ALWAYS CHALLENGING IS THERE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PARTICULAR RULES ABOUT HOW WE CAN CLAIM MONEY. SO THAT'S ALWAYS A YOU KNOW A VERY COMPLICATING FACTOR I THINK YOU KNOW AS AS OUR COUNTY FOLKS TALKED ABOUT HER THE FUNDING BEING VERY COMPLICATED IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. I WOULD SAY IN THE MEDICAID SYSTEM IT'S EXPONENTIALLY MORE WHO ARE COMPLICATED. AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE STRUGGLED WITH AS A STATE OVER THE YEARS AS WE'VE TRIED TO EXPAND SERVICES AND AND REALLY GET PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED WE ALSO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FUND IT BOTH FROM A STATE SIDE WHICH OBVIOUSLY. HAS CHOICES THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE TO MAKE BUT THEN HOW DO WE GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ALSO FUNDS WERE THEIR COMPONENT AND SO. YOU KNOW GET YOU HER MICHELLE TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS WE TALKED ABOUT THOSE EARLIER YOU THAT WAS REALLY AN INNOVATIVE WAY FOR US TO GET ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS TO ADDRESS SOME OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT THAT MONEY IS NOT. SOLELY FOCUSED ON OF THOSE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT A FAIR NUMBER OF THE OF THE COUNTIES HAVE THAT AT THE TARGET POPULATION. AND WE ARE LOOKING AS A PART OF THESE WEAVER AN OLD OF HOW DO WE SCALE THAT UP HOW DO WE REALLY START TALKING ABOUT. LET'S JUST PROVIDE THE SERVICES A PERSON NEEDS AND NOT MAKE NOT TRY TO SAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE IN THIS IS AGAIN PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THIS. TO GET THIS PROGRAM YOU NEED TO HAVE PURPLE STRAIGHT AND PINK POLKA DOTS IN THIS PROGRAM YOU NEED TO BE BLUE. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT ARE BENEFICIARIES FACING IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T WORK BUT WE WE WANT TO TRY TO FIX THAT BUT WE ARE OVERLAYING THESE COMPLICATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COUNTY AND STATE STRUCTURE NOT JUST FROM MENTAL HEALTH NICKEL SERVICES. TO SO IT IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE I'M HOPEFULLY UP TO THE CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF MY VERY EXCITED ABOUT. THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND WORKING WITH THESE PARTNERS AND OTHERS WHO ARE HERE AND LISTENING BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. BUT IT IS IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY AND IF THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE CHOICES THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE YOUR TARGET THE WINDS WILL BE DONE. YOUR WHOLE AREA. SO AGAIN FOLKS YOU HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THIS I TALK ABOUT IT SORT OF IS FIVE TEN AND FIFTEEN YEARS. IN TERMS OF REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE THESE CHANGES IN A WAY THAT'S NOT GONNA BREAK ANYTHING BECAUSE I THINK OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT A SITUATION WHERE WE FULLY TRANSITION TO SOMETHING AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WAS THE WRONG DECISION. SO OUR FIRST GOAL IS TO RELEASED HAVE THESE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE NEXT WEAVER SITUATION TO REALLY BE LOOKING AT WHERE CAN WE MAKE IMMEDIATE SORT OF SHORT TERM GAINS IN TERMS OF BETTER CARE COORDINATION -- OBLIGATIONS ON HEALTH PLANS AND COUNTIES IN TERMS OF INTEGRATION AND SORT OF SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESS FOR THE BENEFICIARY -- AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN IN TALKING WITH COUNTY SAN PLANS ABOUT PILOTING INTEGRATED MODELS. I THINK THAT IT. IF YOU IT WAS ME DEVELOPING THE WORLD RIGHT WE WOULD HAVE AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A FISHERIES WHO HAVE TO ACCESS SERVICES. ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DENTAL SOME YOU KNOW SOME BEFORE SERVICE THE MANAGED CARE THAT THEY DESERVE I CAN'T. HELP HER HARD ENOUGH AND I THINK FOR ANY OF US BUT IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. IT'S VERY COMPLICATED SO IF I COULD RUN THE WORLD I WOULD SAY WE PUT ALL IN ONE SYSTEM WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT SYSTEM IS -- BUT I THINK THAT'S A LONGER TERM GOAL GIVEN SOME OF THE YOU KNOW AGAIN RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO HOW THE FINANCING IS DONE AND AND THE ROLES OF THE STATE IN THE COUNTY BUT I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT IN THIS. NEXT FIVE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN CONCERT GETTING TO THAT LONG TERM PICTURE [inaudible] THE HOPEFULLY I WILL. THAT'S THE GOOD THING. WELL I THINK THAT -- AT THE TOP OF PAGE -- TWENTY WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT IS FOR MANY YEARS THE LEGISLATURE'S GRAPPLED WITH HOW TO ASSESS ASSESS BOTH ACCESS TO AND QUALITY OF CARE IN THE MEDIC MEDIC CAL PROGRAM. IN GENERAL AND PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE NEXT SENTENCE I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION HAS REMAINED FAIRLY ON ACCESSIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR A HOST OF REASONS AND FRUSTRATION AMONG LEGISLATORS IS GROWING. I THINK THAT IS CLEAR AND I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT TO WITH EACH COUNTY HAVING THE ROOM PROGRAM. WITH -- COUNTY IS RUNNING THESE THAT THE STATE DOES STRUGGLE WITH THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED -- AS THE AS THE PROGRAMS GET FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE STATE. IT'S BECOMING HARDER AND HARDER TO REVIEW SO WE WANT YOU TO GIVE US -- TO ASSESS IT IT'S BECOMING MORE MORE DIFFICULT WE HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE TO PROVIDE US THE INFORMATION BUT WITH THE COUNTIES SO IT [inaudible] HAVING. THIS CONTROL IN THIS LAYERING IT BECOMES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT WE'RE NOT GOING. TO RESOLVE TODAY BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ABSOLUTELY WILL BE ADDRESSED IN WILL BE -- WE'LL BE CONTINUING TO ADDRESS ANYTHING FURTHER. ALL RIGHT PUBLIC COMMENT. HELLO MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS GOOD EVENING. I AM VERY MAKE DATING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AGAIN UP I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS ROBUST DISCUSSION AND THE VARIED PANELISTS I THINK YOU'RE TO REALLY GOOD PERSPECTIVE FROM OUR PARTNERS THE COUNTIES. AND OUR PARTNERS AT THE STATE AND ADDS UP MISS CAN'T WILL MENTIONED AND AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER NOTICED IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM -- BUT WE DO THINK THAT COUNTIES ARE DOING THE WORK THEY'RE DOING IT WELL -- WERE WORKING ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT -- SILOS AND LINES -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EVERYBODY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED. ONE AREA THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON RIGHT NOT ONLY HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH BUT STILL IT WORKING ON INTEGRATING -- MENTAL HEALTH WAS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER REALLY WAS INTEGRATED INTO. MENTAL HEALTH UNDER THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH UMBRELLA PRETTY RECENTLY AND SO -- WE'RE STILL WORKING ON INTEGRATING THAT AND SOME THINGS THAT WOULD HELP US WITH THAT WAS -- IMAGES SAY FUNDING. CAN ONLY BE USED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NOT S. U. D. SERVICES SO THAT'S ONE CHANGE THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST IF WE WERE GOING TO MAKE ANY CHANGES THERE. SO -- WORKING ON INTEGRATING WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE INTEGRATING AND THEN WORKING ON OUTSIDE THE SILOS WITH ALL OF OUR OTHER PARTNERS. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE GET THE PICK CARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT WHERE THEY CAN REACH. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT.

VERY GOOD. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE PANELISTS. QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. ONE THAT WAS RIPPED. THANK YOU MANAGER RELATED -- TO DISASTERS -- CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WHAT YOU PLAN TO NOW OR HOW HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK -- YEAH ABSOLUTELY -- SO -- WHENEVER DISASTERS A QUARTER IF THERE'S ARE ON CERTAIN TYPE OF PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATION SO SAY EXAMPLE WILL JUST USE THE RECENT CAMPFIRE -- A PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATION WAS MADE THAT ALLOWED US THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO APPLY FOR GRAHAM SERVICES SO THIS IS OUR GRANT FUNDING THAT ALLOWS -- US TO YOU GIVE MONEY TO THE COUNTY SO THAT THEY CAN HIRE ARE CRISIS COUNSELORS TO GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITIES AND LOOK FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SUFFERED.
