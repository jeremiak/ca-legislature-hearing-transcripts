THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE SECRETARY NOTICES THE PRESENCE OF A QUORUM GOOD MORNING EVERYONE WELCOME BACK TODAY IS OUR THIRD FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING. FOR THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR FIRST UP ON OUR AGENDA TODAY COLLEAGUES AS YOU'RE NOT ON THE AGENDA WILL CONSIDER THE EARLY ACTION BUDGET PACKAGE WHICH CONSISTS OF A CURRENT YEAR BUDGET DEAL THAT'S AB. SEVENTY TWO AND ONE TRAILER BILL AB. SEVENTY THREE AFTER WE TAKE ACTION ON THOSE BILLS -- WILL MOVE INTO THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING PORTION OF TODAY'S HEARING AND IT WILL FOCUS ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET RESILIENCY PROPOSALS INCLUDING THE PROPOSAL SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENTS. AND RESERVE PROPOSALS. THE STATE'S FISCAL STRENGTH AND RESILIENCY ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND PROTECT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THAT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS PARTICULARLY THE MOST VULNERABLE RELY ON DURING BAD ECONOMIC TIMES THOSE OF US WERE HERE DURING THE LAST RECESSION UNDERSTAND THAT ALL TOO WELL. ALONG THESE LINES ADMINISTRATION AS A NUMBER PROPOSALS RELATED TO DEBT IN LIABILITY PAYMENTS INCLUDING PENSION AND RESERVES. THESE PROPOSALS ARE CENTRAL TO THE OVERALL ARCHITECTURE THE BUDGET AND TODAY'S HEARING WILL GIVE ALL OF US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW WE SHOULD CONSIDER THEM. AS WE PROCEED THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. FOR THE INFORMATIONAL PART OF THE HEARING WE HAVE RIGHT CALPERS. AND CAL STIRS JOINING US ALONG WITH THE LA -- AND OF COURSE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'D LIKE TO WELCOME MISTER. THIS ONE UP ON I KNOW THAT YOU JUST TAKING PITY ON ME AND YOU'RE GONNA SAY HOWEVER I PRONOUNCE IT BUT I'M GONNA TRY. FOR THE INTO THIS BUDGET CYCLE IS GOING TO ROLL OFF MY TONGUE LIKE A DOES YOURS MISTER THIS ONE OFF ON WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU AGAIN TO OUR COMMITTEE. ON AND INVITE YOU TO PRESENT THE EARLY ACTION BUDGET PACKAGE RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU AGAIN HERE TODAY AND THAT COMMITTEE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS EARLY ACTION PACKAGE AND I WANNA MAKE TWO VERY BRIEF POINTS AT THE BEGINNING. THE FIRST IS THAT THIS IS REALLY AN EMERGENCY PACKAGE DEALS WITH MEASURES LIKE WLDFIRES EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. IMMIGRATION AND THE CRISIS AT THE BORDER AND THE AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE OUR CORE TO THE COMPETENCY AFFECT GOVERNMENT. AND ISSUES THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNOR HAD PROPOSED AND AND HIS JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR ENACTMENT IN JUNE WE DIDN'T THINK THAT THERE WAS ANY REASON TO WAIT AND WE TALKED. LET'S BEGIN ON THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE SECOND ONE I WANT TO MAKE IS I KNOW THIS PACKAGE CAME TOGETHER VERY QUICKLY -- THE GOVERNOR WAS SWORN IN JUST A MONTH AGO TODAY ON JANUARY SEVENTH IN TODAY'S FEBRUARY SEVENTH -- SO I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION MUCH OF STUFF AND SHAUN CHRIS WHAT'S IN THE PRO TEM'S OFFICE GETTING THIS TO THE FLOOR IN THE ASSEMBLY. TO WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU ARE TWO BILLS THERE'S AB SEVENTY TWO WHICH IS AMENDMENT TO THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET BILL. AS WELL AS AB SEVENTY THREE WHICH IS A TRAILER BILL AND I'LL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE ITEMS IN EACH OF THEM IN TURN. IN AB SEVENTY TWO THEIR SIX COMPONENTS THAT WARRANT YOUR ATTENTION. THE FIRST IS A PROPERTY TAX BACK FILL -- FOR THE FIRES THAT OCCURRED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN YEAR -- THIS INCLUDES A THREE YEAR BACK FILL FOR BUTTE COUNTY AND LAKE COUNTY. AS WELL AS A ONE YEAR BACK FILL RIGHT NOW FOR A LOS ANGELES COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHASTA COUNTY AND SISKIYOU COUNTY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER -- JURISDICTIONS FOR EXAMPLE VENTURA COUNTY -- THAT WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE INFORMATION YET FOR WHAT EXACTLY THEY'RE BACK FILL WILL BE BUT ADDS THAT INFORMATION COMES IN OVER THE MONTHS IN THE YEAR TO COME. OUT WE WILL MAKE SURE AND FUTURE BUDGET ACTIONS TO ADJUST THAT APPROPRIATION SO THAT ALL COUNTIES ARE RECEIVING THE BACK FILL THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED. TO IN THIS PROCESS SO WE WORK WITH THE COUNTIES TO CALCULATE THE EXACT AMOUNT OF THE BACK FAILED. AND THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT IS IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED THESE JURISDICTIONS AND THE ABSENCE OF A FIRE. AND WHAT THEY ARE RECEIVING TODAY WITH THEIR NEW ASSESSMENTS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DIFFERENCE IS SOMETHING THAT WE AT THE STATE LEVEL. CAN FILL IT. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS PACKAGE IN AB SEVENTY TWO RELATES TO EMERGENCY GRANTS WE ALL KNOW THAT EMERGENCIES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN OR WHERE BUT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BUILD RESILIENCY ESPECIALLY AMONGST THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN OUR STATE AND THAT INCLUDES SENIOR RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS COMMUNITIES WITH DISABILITIES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO ALL THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. SOON THIS ELEMENT WE HAVE FIFTEEN MILLION IT'S THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFONE TEARS FOR A STATEWIDE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGN. AS WELL AS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THAT IS FOR GRANTS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN BUILD RESILIENCE IN POCKETS ACROSS THE STATE. THIRD ELEMENT OF THIS PACKAGE IS FOR THE SENATE NOT FUND FOR IMPROVEMENT STORE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT HOW WE FUND THESE IMPROVEMENTS AND HOW THEY WE GO ABOUT MAKING BAND IS PART OF A LONGER CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE. BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO GIVEN THAT AT THE CURRENT PACE OF EXPENSES THIS FUND IS WAS PROJECTED TO RUN TWO ZERO DOLLARS THIS YEAR AND WE KNOW FROM RECENT EMERGENCIES. JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE A RELIABLE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT WE WOULD INCLUDE A TEN MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND LOANS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE IMPROVEMENTS CONTINUE TO GET MADE WHILE WE HAD THE CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON A LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR THAT. THE FOURTH ELEMENT IS FOR EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES AND THIS INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS DIRECTLY FOR EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER. AS WELL AS TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO WATER SYSTEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT STANDARDS. AGAIN HERE AS WITH NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A CONVERSATION TO BE HAD ABOUT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR THESE -- FUNDING PACKAGE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT IN THE MONTHS TO COME BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE MAKE SURE THAT THIS MONEY GETS OUT THE DOOR. RIGHT NOW SO THAT COMMUNITIES IN NEED HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES. FIFTH ELEMENT HERE IS -- FOR IMMIGRATION RAPID RESPONSE THAT PARTICULARLY THE SITUATION AT THE BORDER BY THE GOVERNOR AND HIS BUDGET PROPOSED THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE WE'RE PROPOSING IN THIS EARLY ACTION PACKAGE ADVANCING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT. TO THE CURRENT YEAR WITH TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO CALM -- WE KNOW THAT THEIR A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS DOING REALLY IMPORTANT CRITICAL WORK THERE AT THE BORDER AND SOME OF THEM HAD VERY URGENT NEED FOR FUNDS AND WE KNOW IT'S A PRIORITY OF MANY OF YOU AS WELL. TO GET THAT MONEY MOVING AS SOON AS CAPTION THIS PACKAGE TOGETHER WITH YOU -- THE MOMENT THAT THIS BILL WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR AFTER PASSING THE SENATE AS WELL -- THAT MONEY WILL BEGIN TO START FLOWING. AND THE LAST ELEMENT OF THIS PACKAGE IS MONEY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR PUBLIC UTILITY OF LIABILITY ISSUES MAKING SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THE COUNCIL THAT IT NEEDS WE KNOW THAT THE P. JEANNIE SITUATION IS TOP OF MIND FOR THE GOVERNOR ND HIS ADMINISTRATION. TOP OF MIND FOR MANY OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SITUATION IS HANDLED IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS. MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO SAVE A RELIABLE SUPPLY OF POWER AND MAKE SURE THAT VICTIMS ARE ADEQUATELY TREATED AND AND A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS IN AB SEVENTY THREE THIS IS THE TRAILER BILL -- THE FIRST IS THE RECREATION OF THAT DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT. THIS IS THE AUTHORITY THAT ENABLES THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE IN IN A IN AN EMERGENCY TO TRANSFER MONEY FROM THE ASSET TO USE THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES. INTO THIS ACCOUNT SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE TO BEGIN RESPONSE TO FOR DISASTER WEBSTER DEBRIS REMOVAL OR OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES -- WHILE WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THE RESPONSE IN SERVICE AT ALREADY HAD LAPSED AT THE END OF THE YEAR ON JANUARY FIRST. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE AS MENTIONED WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT EMERGENCY WILL COME THAT WE RENEW THAT ALREADY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND AND WORKING WITH THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE STAFF OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE WE WERE ABLE TO CRAFT LANGUAGE THAT PRESERVES THE DIRECTOR FINANCES FLEXIBILITY WHILE ASO MAINTAINING THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS THE APPROPRIATE -- IN OUR GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE A IN THE RIGHT. BUT THAT DOES FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO BE SPENT IN THE RIGHT MANNER. A AND THEN THE LAST THING HERE BEGAN WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ARE A SERIES OF BRIEF AMENDMENTS TO A BILL FROM LAST YEAR SB ELEVEN NINETY FOUR AT THIS IS A PRIVACY BILL AS IT RELATES TO COMMON CARRIERS BOTH. IN KEEPERS AND HOTEL OWNERS AS WELL AS BOSTON OTHER CHARTER TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES -- THEY'RE MANIFESTS OF PASSENGERS ARE PRIVATE BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC HEALTH CIVIL RIGHTS CONSUMER PROTECTION AND PC INVESTIGATIONS AT THOSE INVESTIGATORS TO HAVE THE TOOLS. THAT THEY NEED SO THAT'S AB -- SEVENTY THREE THOSE ARE THE TWO BILLS BEFORE YOU AND VERY HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON EITHER THOSE BILLS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST AS A POINT OF REFERENCE COLLEAGUES BOTH BILLS AB SEVENTY TWO IN AB SEVENTY THREE PASSED OFF THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR WITH NO NO VOTE. OF FIRST STEPS IN REQUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGER DO APPRECIATE THE THE COMING TO TODAY -- IN THE BOTTOM LINE IS JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON TWO ITEMS LIKE COUNTY TAX BACK FILL AS WELL AS NINE ONE ONE THIS BACK FILL -- IS COMING FROM BACK TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE DEVASTATING FIRES WERE LIKE ANY LOST TWELVE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO HOMES. THEY'RE STILL AT A JUST UNDER IN ITS BECAUSE STATE. CINEMA AND NAPA WE CAN EARN AT TIMES THREE TIMES MORE PER HOUR -- FOLKS JUST CAN'T. BUY THERE'S NO LATE A THANK YOU TO THE MINISTRATION WAS A THANK YOU TO THE PRO TEM MR WOODS INTO THE BUDGET CHAIR. FOR FOCUSING IN ON THIS IN THIS UNIQUE SITUATION -- AND IT'S BEEN DEVASTATING IKNOW HOUSE ON CENTER NIELSEN SISTER CAN JUST VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE FOCUSING PLEASE PRESS OUR THANKS MISS MOSLER. THINK ON THE ONE NICE ITEM -- MADAM CHAIR IS ON NINE ONE ONE UNDERSTAND THIS IS A DOWN PAYMENT TO BE ABLE TO GET US WHAT WE NEED IN THE PROJECT KICKED OFF. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE -- HAVE TO SPEAK FOR MYSELF WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET A PERMANENT FIX WHICH MEANS WE GOTTA COME TOGETHER. NO MATTER WHAT PARTY YOU BELONG TO TO BE ABLE TO GET AN ONGOING SHE ESTABLISHED -- THAT FOUR NINE ONE ONE AND RELATED EMERGENCY ALERTS -- BECAUSE WE ARE VERY VULNERABLE ACROSS THE STATE -- WHEN IT COMES TO OUR NEW REALITY WITH WHILE AND FIRES AND GOD FORBID EARTHQUAKE SO I HOPE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT THIS YEAR ON THAT PERMANENT FUNDING SOURCE IN AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH? SENATOR STERN. A MEASURE -- WELCOME BACK MR RESPONSE ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK IN PUTTING THIS TOGETHER IN A TIMELY WAY I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MOVE THIS. IMMEDIATELY HERE SO I'M LOOKING FOR TO VOTING ON AT ALL TODAY TWO QUESTIONS ON SEVENTY TWO ONCE ON THE PROPERTY TAX BACK I KNOW THEY'RE BEING CONVERSATIONS WITH LA COUNTY IN VENTURA COUNTY ON GOING AND THAT. THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THIS -- THIS ROUND ESPECIALLY FOR THE WALLS THE FIRE PIECE OF IT I JUST WANT TO GET SOME CLARITY THOUGH ABOUT THE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND WHETHER WE EXPECT SOME RESOLUTION ON THIS ISSUE IN THE MAY REEBOKS. SO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES CHRIS HILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER IN MORE DETAIL THE PACKAGE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. DOES HAVE SOME BACK FILL FOR LA COUNTY ALL THE CHRIS WILL BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS IN IS IN INCLUDED CAN BUT YOU ARE RIGHT ON VENTURA COUNTY THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM IT'S NOT IN THIS BILL RIGHT NOW. NO GOOD MORNING CRYSTAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT'S CORRECT I BELIEVE THERE IS -- FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BUILT INTO AB -- SEVENTY TWO AND I'M SORRY I MISSPOKE TO POINT TO A TWO POINT. SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY. BASED ON PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES TO RECEIVE FROM THEM. AND THEN WE'VE BEEN A REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE VENTURA COUNTY AUDITOR COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND THEY'VE TOLD US ARE WORKING -- BUT THERE OUGHT ASSESSOR TO GET NUMBERS FORCE AND THEY HOPE TO HAVE SOMETHING VERY SOON WHICH WE WOULD THEN PUT MOST LIKELY IN THE REVISION GREAT YEAH I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE I NOTES PAPERWORK TAKES A LITTLE TIME ESPECIALLY WITH THESE NEAR TERM EMERGENCIES AND SOME OF THE BACK THOSE. DATE BACK THREE YEARS SO IT TAKES THE TIME BUT JUST APPRECIATE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE LOCAL COUNTY SAN. FILL IN THAT GAP HOPEFULLY IN THE MAY REVISE OTHER QUESTION WAS IS -- THE ON THE ON THE CAL VOLUNTEERS INVESTMENT CAN YOU JUST FLUSH OUT FOR US A LITTLE BIT MORE WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE --% THAT THAT THIRTY MILLION JUST IN A IN A LITTLE WHAT IF YOU COULD ELABORATE YES SO -- I'LL MAKE IT SO THIS IS A NEW PROPOSAL SO THE FIRST THING I'LL SAY IS WE DO HAVE -- WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK IN THIS IS DIRECTLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS A SO CAL VOLUNTEERS IN THERE THEY RUN THEIR PROGRAM THERE ALSO WITHIN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WHICH ITSELF IT REPORTS TO THE GOVERNOR. A BUT WHAT WE'RE THINKING FOR THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE LOCAL GRANTEES THIS IS FOR A STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN AND SOME OF THAT IS PUBLIC AWARENESS MAKING SURE PEOPLE KNOW THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND WHERE TO GO -- BUT ANOTHER COMPONENT IS DIRECT -- EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS TRAINING AND WHAT WE SAW IN THESE MOST RECENT FIRES -- SOME PRETTY HEART RENDING STORIES PARTICULARLY WHEN IT CAME TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND GROUP HOMES FOR SENIORS WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE POPULATIONS IN PARTICULAR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. HAD ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED WHEN IT COMES TO THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF WHAT THAT PROGRAM WILL LOOK LIKE -- WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO THERE AND WE WOULD DEFINITELY WELCOME YOUR INPUT I WOULD LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT FOR THE IT'S A IT'S A VERY. WORTHY CAUSE AND YET THE THOSE MOST VULNERABLE TO GET LEFT BEHIND IN. AND WE CAN'T HAVE IT HAPPEN AGAIN IT'S IT'S A MORAL CHARGE FOR ALL OF US AT THANKS FOR PUTTING SOME ATTENTION ON REMINDING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT IN THE GOVERNOR. FOR THE FOCUS OF THESE. EMERGENCY ALLOCATIONS. AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE IMPORT -- FOR THE BACK FILL FOR FIRE VICTIMS I WANT TO FOCUS IN AND APPRECIATE. THE TWO ALLOCATIONS FOR DRINKING WATER -- AND REALLY THE EMERGENCY PUBLIC HEALTH NATURE. OF PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON BOTTLED WATER FOR DRINKING BATHING AND COOKING -- THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION THAT I KNOW THE GOVERNOR IS COMMITTED. TO BUT WE ARE DEALING WITH COMMUNITIES IN CRISIS RIGHT NOW. AND I JUST WANT TO APPRECIATE THAT RECOGNITION AS WE WORK ON A LONG TERM SOLUTION. THAT THIS IS REALLY EMERGENCY FIRST AID SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE ARE MORE LOCK. SURE I'M JUST CURIOUS JUST THREE QUICK QUESTIONS ON THE ESTATE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER ACCOUNT WHY ARE WE MAKING IT ALONE. SO THE REASON WE DECIDED TO PROPOSE THAT IS ALONE IN THIS IS CAN JUMP IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFFS OVER HERE. IS THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF CONVERSATION TO BE BAD ABOUT HOW THIS WILL BE FUNDED OVER THE LONG TERM -- AND THERE YOU KNOW SOME FOLKS I KNOW THINK THAT WE MIGHT HAVE MONEY IN THE GENERAL FUND THE ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW IS THAT. MOST OF THE GENERAL FUND MONEY WE HAD THIS ONE TIME AND TO ACTUALLY MAKE THESE IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS WE NEED A SUSTAINABLE SUSTAINABLE FORCE -- SOURCE OF FUNDING. WE THOUGHT THAT THIS. TO SIDING ON HOW THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO IN TWO TO THREE WEEKS -- AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS REVIEW IS REALLY AN EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS WHILE WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION CONVERSATION OVER THE LONG TERM. SO THAT'S WHY WE THOUGHT IT COULD BE ALONE MAKE SURE WE BEGIN TO BUILD THOSE REDUNDANCIES INTO OUR MICROWAVE NETWORK FOR NINE ONE ONE AND DAD IN MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE. HAVE THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU OVER HOW TO FUND THESE IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE LONG TERM. THEM THANK YOU THEN ON THE ON THE YOU'VE GOT THREE ITEMS. FOR A DRINKING WATER AND SO OBVIOUSLY WE'VE WE'VE GOT IT THE SYSTEMIC. ISSUES OF WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH AND IN CALIFORNIA. DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON MAY BE A LONG TERM STRATEGY. YES -- SO PUTTING ASIDE THESE EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS AS WELL AS THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL COMPONENT MONNING WHICH VERY BRIEFLY -- ENABLE SCHOOLS TO GET BETTER HELP TO THE AXIS OF THE NEED FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER IN SCHOOLS. A LONGER TERM THAT WE PROPOSED IN OUR BUDGET -- SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PACKAGE WHICH INCLUDES A COMBINATION OF A FEE ON DRINKING WATER AS WELL AS FEES PAID BY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS IN OTHER DAIRY FARMERS THAT PUT NITRATES INTO THE GROUND. BUT AGAIN WE KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS WE KNOW SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK WITH YOU ON AND THAT'S WHY WHILE THAT'S THE POSITION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS. WE DIDN'T WANT TO PUT IT IN THIS PARTICULAR PACKAGE THIS PACKAGE IS STRICTLY FOR THESE EMERGENCY SUPPLIES EMERGENCY BOTTLED WATER OF THE TYPE THAT SENATOR MONNING MENTIONED. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THAT LONGER TERM SOLUTION JUNE. AND SO JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME FEEDBACK WE'RE GETTING PLENTY OF RESPONSE AGAINST A WATER TAX SO JUST. WANTED JUST. PLAY THE OTHER THAN THE LAST QUESTION IS. THE SETTING ASIDE FIFTEEN MILLION -- FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITY LIABILITY ISSUE -- IS IS THIS IS A SPENDING THAT'S GOING TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OR OR DO YOU PLAN ON HIRING AN OUTSIDE BANKRUPTCY LAWYER FIRM OR WHAT WHAT WHAT. WERE THIS WHO TO DO GETS THIS MONEY TO THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED IN THIS BILL AT IT GOES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT IT'S REALLY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AS A WHOLE AND SET YOU KNOW THE IN BETWEEN THE GENERAL THEY ARE ALSO VERY INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE. THE P. YOU SEE IS INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE -- BUT ONE THING THAT WE REALIZED COMING AND I THINK IT WAS THE FIRST WE CAN BE ADMINISTRATION ONE PGA NAY -- FILED FOR BANK I SIGNALED THEY WOULD FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY AND TEN FIFTEEN DAYS LATER THEY ACTUALLY. COMMUNICATED AND DID THAT FILING THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR'S HAVING MEETINGS ON IT EVERY DAY THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND WARY THEY'RE DEALING WITH IT EVERY SINGLE DAY SO WHAT WE REALLY WANTED WAS AND NO REGRETS. STRATEGY WE DON'T WANT THE POWER BEING INTERRUPTED. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THOSE IN FAVOR ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING OUT. FOR THEIR CLAIMS REPRESENTED IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AS WELL AS THE BROADER ISSUES SURROUNDING THAT PROCEEDING -- AND AS MENTIONED WE EXPECT THIS TO GO ON FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER IS HAPPENING UP YOU SEE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS THE BEST ADVICE POSSIBLE AND ONE OTHER POINT THAT I SHOULD THAT IS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW P. GENIES IN THE HEADLINES BUT THIS AFFECTS A RANGE OF COMPANIES IN ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE KNOW P. JEANNIE OF COURSE IS MOSTLY CENTERED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER ISSUES COME UP WHATEVER NEGOTIATIONS ARE HAPPENING THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THAT ADVICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SIR SENATOR NIELSEN. I DO WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR. FOR THE SENSITIVITY. TO THE ISSUE UP ON THE PARADISE RICH. AND THE THE PLIGHT OF BUTTE COUNTY. THAT RELATES TO THE DISEASE TAX MONIES. AND TE TO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE A THREE YEAR. COMMITMENT IS I BELIEVE IN ORDER BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE. AND THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER HUGE EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTING THAT COUNTY. AND INDEED POTABLE WATER IS A BIG ISSUE. UP THERE RIGHT NOW. I BELIEVE THAT AS WE PROCEED. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE A HAVE SOLUTIONS. GOING AHEAD FOR OTHER COUNTIES AS WELL AND WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF HOW WE DEVELOP THOSE. BUT THE KEY IS THE RESPONSE AND THE IMMEDIACY OF THE NEED RIGHT NOW. THE NINE ONE ONE I HAVE NOT BEEN TO SYMPATHETIC BUTLAST HEARING. IT WAS ENCOURAGING TO HAVE SOME DEFINITIVE DISCUSSION. ABOUT WHAT THAT'S TO LOOK LIKE AND WHAT IT IS TO ACCOMPLISH IN NINE TREAT YOU AS WE PROCEED. TO BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT IS THE PLAN. WEEK WE CAN'T JUST RACE HE IN A DIFFERENT MANNER. AND THEN NOT LOWERED WILL GET. AND THERE HAS TO BE A STAGING AND A GOOD PROGRAM. GOING AHEAD OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO UTILIZED AND IN A FORMAT. THAT NEW INTEGRATED. ONE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. A BE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY OVER THAT WITH THE POLICE LAST WEEK I WAS FOR THE FIRST TIME A LITTLE BIT ENCOURAGED COULD SEE BROUGHT FOR SOME DEFINITIVE INFORMATION. THIRTY ROCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO THE THE WATER FEE. AND THE LIKE I I DON'T THINK ANY OF US OF REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT -- UP HERE. AND IN THE LARGER BODY -- WOULD ARGUE THAT WE HAVE A SERIOUS NEED IN CALIFORNIA THEIR COMMUNITIES. MANY OF THEM DISADVANTAGED THAT ARE. THAN SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO WATER THAT'S APPROPRIATE. TO DRINK OR COOK WITH OR DO ANYTHING ELSE WITH -- I ASSUME THE MONEY THAT WOULD BE GENERATED BY A FEE WOULD BE USED TO PROVIDE OPERATIONAL SUBSIDIES. TO THESE SMALL DISTRICTS SENSE THERE APPEARS TO BE MONEY THROUGH VARIOUS BONDS WATER BONDS IN THE LIKE AVAILABLE FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OPERATIONAL SUBSIDIES. TO TRY TO DRIVE THE COST OF THE WATER DOWN SO IT'S REASONABLE ONCE WE GET IT TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S CAPABLE OF BEING CONSUMED. I'D LIKE TO SEIZE BEFORE THIS COMES BACK. AND I KNOW WHAT WILL I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME ANALYSIS DONE TO DETERMINE. HOW MANY OF THESE SMALL WATER COME COMPANIES ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY REMOTE WHERE IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONNECT? WITH THE PIPING OF A LARGER WATER DISTRICT WHETHER WE REQUIRE THAT. CONSOLIDATION OR CONNECTION OR SIMPLY INCENTIVIZE. AND HOW MANY OR ASSOCIATED HOWEVER REMOTELY WITH LARGER WATER DISTRICTS WERE SUCH. REQUIREMENT OR INCENTIVIZE CONSOLIDATION COULD OCCUR AND THEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR EXAMPLE THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. TO OPERATIONALLY SUBSIDIZE THE SMALL GEOGRAPHICALLY REMOTE WATER DISTRICTS. I THINK THAT WOULD HELP US SOME OF THOSE. WERE THIS WATER FEE IS A VERY VERY SENSITIVE ISSUE. HELP US DEAL WITH THE SENSITIVITY OF AS WE UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE NEED. AND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GET IT WHETHER WE GET IT THROUGH WATER FEE OR WHETHER WE GET IT THROUGH A COMBINATION OF A WATER FEE AND SOME TRUST ACCOUNT THAT WE BUILD TO THE GENERAL FUND OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS. OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM -- AND WE CAN ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS TODAY I DON'T EXPECT TO BUT I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE ELSE IS DONE. BY SOMEONE. OTHER THAN THE ADVOCATES FOR THE WATER FEE -- BEFORE IT COMES BACK IF THAT MAKES ANSWER YES WE WILL DEFINITELY LOOKING TO THANK YOU FOR TOLERATING THE MANAGER. THANK YOU SEEN NO SENATOR Y. CASKEY I'D LIKE TO MOVE AB. SEVENTY TWO FIVE HE WOULD ALLOW ME TO OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT FIRST I'D BE I'D APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU THOUGH I FEAR Y. CASKEY.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE BUDGET RESILIENCY ACTIONS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS INCLUDING ANYTHING THAT COMES UP FROM OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE TESTIFYING UP HERE AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THE PRESENTATIONS IN ORDER THAT YOU ALL ARE LISTED. IN THE AGENDA THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. OKAY BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU. GREAT. SO THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSE IN THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT A BUDGET THAT IS BALANCED IN A GIVEN YEAR. ONE IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PACKAGE THIS YEAR IS THAT HE WANTED TO PROPOSE A BUDGET THAT'S NOT SIMPLY BALANCE THIS YEAR BUT IS BALANCED OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS [inaudible] SO. THE FIRST COMPONENT THAT IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD ACHIEVED BALANCE OVER THOSE FOLLOWING THREE YEARS -- WHICH GOES INTO THE FORECAST PERIOD OF TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUT WE DON'T SIMPLY WANT BALANCED ADMINISTRATION WANTED THAT I REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES TO BE STRUCTURALLY BALANCE WHICH MEANS THAT THE REVENUES. RECEIVED THAT WE'RE PROJECTING IN THAT YEAR ALL THE WAY OUT TO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND EXPENDITURES WE'RE PROJECTING. FOR THAT YEAR OUR BALANCE SO THE BUDGET WE PROPOSE TO YOU IS BALANCED OVER THAT MULTI YEAR PERIOD. WE ALSO THINK THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE PROPOSE IN THAT MULTI YEAR FORECAST A REASONABLE WERE AVERAGING ABOUT OVER YEAR -- WE ALSO PROJECT THAT -- GROWTH IN THE OVERALL ECONOMY IS A FUNCTION OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE RECENTLY -- RAISING SOME OF THEIR THEIR INTEREST THEIR BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES ARE THE EFFECTS OF THE TAX CUT PACKAGE THAT WAS PASSED IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. BEGINNING TO WEAR OFF AND THE FACT THAT OUR REVENUE AND ECONOMIC ECONOMICS UNIT IS PROJECTING MORE GROWS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION WHICH OF COURSE IS VERY GOOD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT HAS A MODERATING A FACT WHEN ITCOMES TO THE GROWTH OF OUR OVERALL STATE REVENUE. WE DON'T AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROJECT RECESSIONS. IT'S VERY HARD TO PREDICT WHEN OR HOW IT DOWNTURN WILL OCCUR THERE'S AN OLD JOKE -- THAT ECONOMISTS HAD PREDICTED NINE OUT OF THE LAST FIVE RECESSIONS SO WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'LL HAPPEN BUT THAT BEING THAT BEING SAID -- WE HAVE MODERN WE HAVE MODEL MODEL THE RECESSION INTERNALLY -- FOR WHAT IF SCENARIO WHITE MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THE FACTS THAT IT MIGHT HAVE. THE SCENARIO THAT WE PUT TOGETHER INTERNALLY -- ASSUMES A RECESSION THAT IS LESS SEVERE THAN THE GREAT RECESSION THAT WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT BUT MORE SEVERE THAN THE RECESSION THAT WE SAW AT THE END OF THE FIRST DOT COM BOOM AT THE END OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES. AND UNDER THAT SCENARIO -- WE PROJECTED A LOSS IN REVENUE OF TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER ONE YEAR. AND SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS OVER [inaudible] TO EVEN ASSUME THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WOULD BE FUNDED AT ITS MINIMUM LEVEL YOU'D STILL HAVE ABOUT FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN -- THE BUDGET ISSUE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS SO THESE ARE THE REASONS THAT WE WANT TO BE READY FOR NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS AND WE WANTED TO BUILD. RESILIENCY RIGHT NOW. AND WE REALLY PUT IT IN JUST A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT CATEGORIES THE FIRST IS THE RATIO OF ONE TIME TO ON GOING SPENDING. WE KNOW AS WE DISCUSSED LAST MONTH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE LA OUT IS PROJECTING A SURPLUS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. BUT ALMOST ALL ABOUT SURPLUS IS ONE TIME AND IF WE COMMITTED TO ONGOING SPENDING IT WOULD INCREASE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE BUDGET PROBLEM THAT WE WOULD FACE IN FUTURE YEARS. IN THE EVENT OF A RECESSION SO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES AND ITS BUDGET IS A RATIO OF SIX TO ONE SO THAT MEANS FOR EVERY DOLLAR. THAT WE'RE COMMITTING AN ON GOING SPENDING WE'RE COMMITTING ABOUT SIX DOLLARS IN ONE TIME SPENDING AND THAT SPENDING THAT WILL NOT RECUR SHOULD A DOWNTURN OCCUR IN THE BUDGET YEAR OR IN FUTURE YEARS. THE SECOND THING THAT WE'RE DOING IS PROPOSING PAYING OFF A NUMBER OF BUDGETARY DEBTS AND DEFERRALS AND THAT INCLUDES TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. IN BUDGETARY DATS RELATED TO LOANS FROM SPECIAL FUNDS ONES FROM TRANSPORTATION WAIT FEW LOANS AND SOME OTHER CATEGORIES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THESE LOANS WERE PART OF THAT INITIAL WALL AND DOLLARS AT START OF THIS DECADE SLOWLY BUT SURELY THE STATE HAS BEEN CHIPPING AWAY AT THAT AND WE THINK IN THIS TIME WHEN. THE ECONOMY REMAINS STRONG WHEN WE'RE IN A GOOD BUDGET PLACE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO PAY OFF THE REMAINDER OF THOSE BUDGETARY DEBT LOANS. ARE THE LA -- HAS MADE A COMMENT SUGGESTING. THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE PAY OFF THOSE LOANS BUT OVER A SPECIFIED PERIOD WE KNOW THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE WE THINK OF THAT PAYING OFF THOSE LOANS IS CONSISTENT WITH COULD BUDGET PRACTICE GOOD PHYSICAL HYGIENE. AND IS COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR PROPOSALS TO MAKE UNPRECEDENTED CONTRIBUTIONS INTO ABOUT THE CALPERS AND CAL STIRS SYSTEMS. FOR OUR DEFERRALS WERE ALSO PROPOSING REVERSING THE DEFERRAL THAT MOVED PAYROLL FOR THE STATE FROM JUNE TO JULY THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR -- AS WELL AS A PAYROLL AS WELL AS A DIFFERENT TO CALPERS FOR THE QUARTERLY PAYMENT THAT WE SEND THEM IN THE SUMMER AND AGAIN WE THINK THESE WERE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE IN A BUDGET CRISIS. NOW AGAIN THAT WE'RE IN A PLACE WHERE THE ECONOMY FOR NOW IS STRONG AND ON SOLID FOOTING WE THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE TO REVERSE THOSE DEFERRALS AND GET US BACK TO WHAT IS CONSIDERED NORMAL. BUDGET PRACTICE. AT THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS IS BUILDING UP OUR RESERVES SO IN ADDITION TO OUR RAINY DAY FUND WHICH WITH THE EXPECTED DEPOSIT IN THE BUDGET YEAR OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS -- WE'LL GO FROM THIRTEEN POINT FIVE TO FIFTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN THAT RAINY DAY ACCOUNT WERE ALSO PROPOSING A SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES THIS IS THE STATE'S EMERGENCY ACCOUNT. AND ALSO AS WE DISCUSSED IN AB SEVENTY THREE IN AN EMERGENCY BETRAY THE DISASTER RECOVERY EMERGENCY OP -- AND THEN FINE ARE PROPOSING SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SAFETY NET RESERVE WHICH WOULD MORE THAN QUADRUPLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THAT RESERVE AND I WANT TO MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOME MEMBERS. MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS UP THAT RESERVE WAS CREATED LAST YEAR WITH INITIALLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT'S DESIGNED FOR BOTH CAL WORKS AND FOR MEDI CAL IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNTURN. LAST YEAR'S LANGUAGE -- HAD THE ADMINISTRATION TASKED WITH PUTTING TOGETHER A METHODOLOGY FOR HOW WE WOULD NUMBER ONE PUT CONTRIBUTIONS INTO THAT ACCOUNT. AND NUMBER TO THINK ABOUT SOME SORT OF FORMULA OR STRUCTURE FOR TAKING OUT THOSE FINDS IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY I IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNTURN I'M SORRY. SO WHAT WE DID WITH THIS PROPOSAL LOOKINGINTO IT WE FELT THAT OUR PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW. IS GETS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE GOALS BUT A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE MONEY GOING AND THE METHODOLOGY WE COULD HAVE WORKED ON SUGGESTED LOOKING AT CASELOAD AND TRYING TO USE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEASURES. WE THOUGHT WHATEVER THOSE MEASURES WERE THERE CERTAINLY LESS THAN SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE PROPOSING PUTTING IN RIGHT NOW. AND WE THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF HOW WE FUND THAT ACCOUNT IS IN ORDER AND THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE KNOW WE WANT TO HAVE A WITH ALL OF YOU. AND SIMILARLY WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY COMING OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT -- WE KNOW A LOT OF OUR BUDGETING IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE BUDGET IS BY FORMULA BUT GIVEN IN A DOWNTURN AT BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL HAVE TO MAKE UP GROUND BUT IN MAY DIFFER BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE DOWNTURN. HOW MUCH IN THE WHOLE THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM MAYES VERSUS AS THE MINISTER IS TO HELP GRAHAM'S -- CONNECT THAT'S RIGHT WITH THE NEEDS OF THE LEGISLATURE SO WE WANTED TO KEEP THAT FLEXIBLE FOR RIGHT NOW -- SO QUADRUPLE THAT ACCOUNT BRING IT TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HOW MUCH SHOULD GO TO MEDI CAL HOW MUCH SHOULD GO TO CAL WORKS PRESERVE THE FLEXIBILITY ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. A AND THEN THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE IS ON THE PAYMENTS INTO THE PURSE STARS AND OTHER RETIREE LIABILITIES SYSTEM SO WE'RE PROPOSING AT THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT TEMPERS SUPPLEMENTAL THAT'S ON TOP OF OUR EXISTING. OBLIGATIONS AS A STATE TO MAKE AND WE'RE PROPOSING AND WE'RE WORKING WITH CALPERS TO STRUCTURE THAT PAYMENT BUT THOSE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL FUND DATA THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LA -- HAS POINTED OUT -- COULD BE COULD PRACTICE AS WELL SO WE BELIEVE THAT MONEY'S COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE MADE ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL FUND. FOR ITS OBLIGATIONS AND FOR THE CAL STIRS SYSTEM -- WE'RE PROPOSING ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN PROP TWO PAYMENTS -- IN THE BUDGET YEAR AN OVERALL -- GIVEN THAT WE ARE PAYING OFF OUR BUDGETARY DADS. OUT OF THE BUDGET SURPLUS IN ONE TIME FUNDING WE'RE PROPOSING THAT NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT IN ALL FUTURE YEARS OVER THE BUDGETARY FORECAST PERIOD. TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ALL PROP TWO PAYMENTS WILL BE DEVOTED TO LONG TERM RETIREE AND HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES THAT INCLUDES THE CAL STIRS SYSTEM. THAT INCLUDES PAYMENTS TO REPAY THE SURPLUS MONEY INVESTMENT FUND LOAN THAT WAS USED TO MAKE A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO CALPERS TWO YEARS AGO. AND THAT INCLUDES PAYMENTS INTO THE TRUST FUND. SO WE THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE USE OF THOSE PRODUCTS TO FUNDS AND GIVEN THAT WE PAID OFF OUR BUDGETARY DADS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP THOSE PAYMENTS EXCLUSIVELY. TO THAT AND THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE AND THIS ISN'T DIRECTLY IN THE BUDGET RESILIENCY BUCKET BUT AS YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO ALL DAYS WE ALSO HAVE MONEY DEVOTED TO SCHOOLS THE SCHOOLS SHARE -- BE CAL STIRS LIABILITY SO IT'S NOT BUDGET RESILIENCY FOR THE STATE BUT IT CERTAINLY MEANS A LOT FOR THE SCHOOLS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY -- WITH CAL STAR IS ON HOW EXACTLY TO STRUCTURE THOSE PAYMENTS BUT WE'RE PROPOSING SENDING THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO CAL STARS ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOLS. SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT WOULD BE USED TO REDUCE DIRECTLY TO SCHOOLS PAYMENTS TO THE SYSTEM IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR. AND THE REMAINDER WOULD BE APPLIED TO THE LONG TERM BALANCE TO REDUCE SCHOOLS -- CONTRIBUTION RATE OVER THE LONG TERM WE'RE ESTIMATING BY ABOUT HALF A PERCENTAGE POINT ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THAT THAT CAN CHANGE -- SO THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING ALL OF THIS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION. IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS AND WEEKS OVER THE STATE'S CASH POSITION AND HOW REVENUE PROJECTIONS ARE COMING AND WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL. TAX SYSTEM THAT WE DISCUSSED THAT TAX LEGISLATION FROM DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN XCELERATED THEIR PAYMENTS -- THAT WOULD NORMALLY PAY IN JANUARY OR APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND INSTEAD PAID THOSE IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH THE PLEA FOR THOSE WHO QUALIFY FOR A HIGHER STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION. SO FOR THAT REASON WE SAW LAST PAYING AND WE'RE THINKING THAT A LOT OF THE PAYMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILL NOW BE MADE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS AND ESPECIALLY IN A BRAWL WHEN TAX DAY COMES TO SO. IN MARCH AND APRIL AND MAY WE WILL BE IN VERY CLOSE TOUCH WITH YOU WE'LL BE WATCHING THOSE REVENUE PROJECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUDGET WE PROPOSE WITH THE MAY REVISE WORKING WITH YOU. CONTINUES TO BE BALANCING REFLECTS THE MOST UP TO DATE -- VIEW OF THE STATE'S CASH POSITION AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ONCE EVERYONE WRAPS U THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT COLLEAGUES ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM AND HOLINSHED WITH LA HELLO WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- YOU SHOULD HAVE A HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU THAT I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM HIS HAND OUT IS ALSO BASED ON A REPORT THAT OUR OFFICE RELEASED A FEW DAYS AGO WHICH I HOPE YOU ALSO HAVE A COPY OF IN FRONT OF YOU. I'M IS SO I'M JUST GONNA HAVE SORT OF THREE AREAS OF COMMENTS HERE THE FIRST IS. TO RE CAP -- THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THINKING ABOUT THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THAT BUDGET. AND THEN I'LL GIVE SOME COMMENTS FROM OUR OFFICE IN HELPING THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THAT STRUCTURE IN THINKING ABOUT EACH OF THOSE MAJOR COMPONENTS. BATTLE TRANSITION SPECIFICALLY TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS -- AND GIVE OUR OFFICES COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THOSE AND THOSE FALL INTO THREE AREAS -- RESERVES PAYING OFF RETIREMENT LIABILITIES AND PAYING OFF BUDGETARY BORROWING. ON THE FIRST PAGE. OUR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET STRUCTURE HAS FOUR MAJOR COMPONENTS. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES INCREASING RESERVES BY ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD INCREASE TOTAL RESERVES I WROTE RELATIVE TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETY BUDGET ACT AND THAT WOULD INCREASE TOTAL RESERVES. TO ROUGHLY EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THE LARGEST OF THIS WOULD OF COURSE BE IN THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT WHICH IS THE STATE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RESERVE CREATED BY PROPOSITION -- TWO THERE WAS ALREADY A PRETTY GOOD DESCRIPTION OF THE SAFETY NET RESERVE BUT THAT WAS ALSO INCREASING FROM TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION. AND THEN A PRETTY KEY FEATURE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET STRUCTURE IS HIS NEARLY ELEVEN BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE TO REPAY US STATES DOUBTS IN MY ABILITIES. THESE FALL INTO TWO MAJOR AREAS THE FIRST IS TO ADDRESS LONG TERM RETIREMENT LIABILITIES THAT'S ABOUT SIX POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. AND THE SECOND IS TO ADDRESS BUDGETARY BORROWING THOSE ARE AMOUNTS OF THE GENERAL FUND HAS INCURRED IN PAST YEARS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS BUDGET PROBLEMS THAT ARE STILL OUTSTANDING. NEXT THE GOVERNOR PROVIDES ROUGHLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME SPENDING. AND TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING SPENDING BUT ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES THAT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION WOULD RISE TO AROUND THREE POINT FIVE BILLION IN THE OUT YEARS ONCE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS IS ACHIEVED. ON THE NEXT PAGE -- WE HAVE SOME KEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE LEAD X. ABOUT EACH OF THE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF THE BUDGET EACH OF THESE. PIECES THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE BUDGET AND IT'S LONG TERM TRAJECTORY. THESE FALL INTO GENERALLY THREE AREAS THE FIRST IS THINKING ABOUT A RESERVE TARGET WHAT IS THE TARGET LEVEL OF RESERVES THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THE SECOND IS CONSIDERING ALLOCATING ONE TIME RESOURCES AMONG DEBT REPAYMENTS AND THEN PROGRAMMATIC COMMITMENTS. AND THEN THE THIRD DECIDING THE LEVEL OF ON GOING SPENDING FOR THE BUDGET. THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION HERE NOT GONNA WALK THROUGH EACH OF THESE -- CONSIDERATIONS IN DETAIL BUT JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ONES. SO IN THINKING ABOUT RESERVES THOSE ARE AVAILABLE FOR TO KEEP PURPOSE SAYS ONE IS OF COURSE A RECESSION WHEN THE BUDGET CAN FACE MULTI BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN A BUDGET PROBLEM OVER THE COURSE OF A NUMBER OF YEARS. RESERVES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR UNEXPECTED EVENTS INCLUDING CRISIS IS RELATED TO NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER COSTLY EVENTS FOR THE STATE. IN THINKING ABOUT A RECESSION SPECIFICALLY THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT SIZE OF A RECESSION DOESN'T WANT TO PREPARE. FOR BEING PREPARED FOR A LARGER MORE SUSTAINED RECESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED OF COURSE INVOLVE HIGHER LEVELS OF RESERVES. A SECOND IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS WHAT ACTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE WILLING TO TAKE DURING A RECESSION TO ADDRESS A BUDGET PROBLEM. SO THOSE ACTIONS COULD BE REDUCING PROGRAMMATIC SPENDING INCREASING REVENUES ARE SHIFTING COSTS AS THE STATE HAS DONE IN PREVIOUS RECESSIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE MORE WILLING TO TAKE THOSE ACTIONS DURING A RECESSION LESS RESERVES ARE NEEDED BUT IF YOU'D PREFER TO AVOID THOSE ACTIONS THAN MORE RESERVES ARE NEEDED. THINKING ABOUT ALLOCATING ONE TIME COMMITMENTS BETWEEN THAT AND PROGRAMS THIS IS REALLY A TRADE OFF BETWEEN THE STATE'S IMMEDIATE NEEDS VERSES ITS FUTURE NEEDS. AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE ALLOCATING A DOLLAR TODAY TOWARD DAD WELL ACTUALLY FREE UP MORE THAN A DOLLAR ON GOING. OVER THE COURSE OF THE BUDGET AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT GRAHAM COMMITMENTS BUT OF COURSE THIS PRESENTS A TRADE OFF BECAUSE THAT DOLLAR THAN CAN'T BE USED FOR PROGRAMS TODAY. SO IT'S A TRADE OFF BETWEEN ALLOCATING THAT DOLLAR IMMEDIATELY TO THE STATE'S IMMEDIATE NEEDS VERSUS ALLOCATING THAT DOLLAR IN THE FUTURE. FINALLY CONSIDERING THE LEVEL OF ON GOING COMMITMENTS THAT THE BUDGET HAS CAPACITY TO TAKE ON THIS IS REALLY A BASIC CALCULATION BETWEEN HOW MUCH YOU EXPECT REVENUES TO GROW RELATIVE TO CURRENT ONGOING PROGRAM COMMITMENTS. OF REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO GROW FASTER THAN CURRENT ONGOING PROGRAMS THAT AND THERE ARE SOME CAPACITY TO MAKE THOSE COMMITMENTS AND IF NOT THEN THERE'S PERHAPS LESS CAPACITY TO MAKE ON GOING COMMITMENTS. SOME OF THE TRANSITION FROM THE SORT OF BIG PICTURE -- STRUCTURAL THING -- TO THE RESERVES AND THE DEBT PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY AND GIVE OUR OFFICES COMMENTS. SO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A TOTAL RESERVE LEVEL OF EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AS I ALREADY MENTIONED AND JUST TO PUT A LITTLE CONTEXT AROUND THIS EIGHTEEN BILLION. OUR OFFICE HAS ESTIMATED IN HOUSE REPORTS BUT ABOUT TWENTY BILLION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COVER THE BUDGET PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH A MILD RECESSION. AND ABOUT FORTY BILLION WILL BE NEEDED TO COVER THE BUDGET PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH A MODERN RECESSION PROVIDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT WANT TO TAKE ANY OF THOSE ACTIONS REDUCING SPENDING OR INCREASING REVENUES. IN A NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR WE RELEASED OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK OR ANNUAL PUBLICATION AND WE FOUND THAT THREE BILLION AN ON GOING COMMITMENTS WAS SUPPORTABLE OVER THE BUDGET MULTI YEAR. PROVIDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENTERED A RECESSION SCENARIO WITH TWENTY FIVE BILLION IN RESERVES. SO IF LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKES YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONCUR WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH TO TAKE ON ROUGHLY THREE BILLION IN ON GOING COMMITMENTS. THEN WE DO THINK THAT AT THIS TIME MORE RESERVES WOULD BE PRUDENT. WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS FOR THE L. -- FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS IT THINKS ABOUT PERHAPS BUILDING MORE RESERVES ONE IS OF COURSE TO JUST PUT A DEPOSIT INTO ONE OF THE STATE'S OUR CASH RESERVES ACCOUNTS. AND ANOTHER WOULD BE TO PREPAY RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION THIS IS A LITTLE BIT TECHNICAL HAPPY TO GET INTO AN IN MORE DETAIL IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT MEANS IS THE STATE WOULD TRANSFER TO CALPERS EARLY -- A PAYMENT THAT CALPERS WOULD HOLDEN TRUST ESSENTIALLY LIKE CALPERS HOLDING THE RESERVE FOR THE STATE. AND THEN THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO A FUTURE REQUIRED RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION. EDGE OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT THE RESERVE OF THAT MONEY ONE IT'S HELD A CALPERS CAN ON A SLIGHTLY HIGHER RATE OF RETURN THAT WOULD EARN. BEING IN CASH RESERVES BUT THE TRADE OFF OF COURSE IS WITH THAT WITH GREATER RETURN COMES A GREATER LEVEL OF RISK AND SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD NEED TO BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED. ON THE NEXT PAGE JUST TO GIVE A BRIEF RECAP OF THE GOVERNOR'S RETIREMENT LIABILITY PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY. TO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES MAKING THREE IS SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENTS THESE ARE IN CONTRAST TO WHAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT ABOUT -- PREPAYING A RETIREMENT LIABILITY THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THIS IS IN ADDITION TO A PAYMENT AS OPPOSED TO INSTEAD OF A FUTURE PAYMENT. THESE THREE ARE THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR CALPERS ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR CAL STIRS FOR THE STATE'S SHARE OF THE CONTRIBUTION FOR THE STATE'S TRUCK LIABILITY EXCUSE ME. AND TWO POINT THREE BILLION TO CAL STIRS FOR THE DISTRICTS CHAIR OF THE LIABILITY IN MOST OF MY COMMENTS ARE JUST GONNA FOCUS ON CALPERS AND CASTERS FOR THE STATE'S SHARE. SO YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE PROBABLY MORE ABOUT THIS FROM THE ACTUARIES BUT JUST TO LAY THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT. THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO THINK ABOUT THE SAVINGS THAT THE STATE CAN ACHIEVE FROM EACH OF THESE PAYMENTS THE STAVING COM BASICALLY FROM LOWER SLIGHTLY LOWER OVER THE VERY LONG TERM REQUIRED EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS TO BOTH OF THE SYSTEMS. AND THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT ESTIMATES FOR THINKING ABOUT HOW THE SAVINGS CAN BE ACHIEVED ONE IS WHAT'S CALLED AN ACTUARIAL MODEL AND ONE IS WHAT'S CALLED A STOCHASTIC MODEL. THE ACTUARIAL MODEL SAYS WE'RE GONNA ASSUME ONE FIXED RATE OF RETURN IS ACHIEVED EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT FEW DECADES. SO SAY 7% RATE OF RETURN EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT TWO DECADES. THAT IS OBVIOUSLY UNLIKELY IN THE REAL WORLD AND SO STOCHASTIC MODELS SAYS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE RATE OF RETURN IS ABOVE THIS OR BELOW THIS AND WE LOOK AT THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT -- THE ACTUARIES LOOKING THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT MODELS AT DIFFERENT POSSIBLE RETURN ASSUMPTIONS. SO THE SAVINGS FROM EACH OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS WOULD VERY DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU LOOK AT THE ARCHERY ON MODEL OR THE STOCHASTIC MODELS. WITH CALPERS THE STOCHASTIC MODEL IS A LITTLE BIT HAD ACTUALLY OF THE OXFORD A MODEL THERE'S LITTLE MORE SAVINGS. WITH CAL STIRS THERE'S LESS SAVINGS AND IN FACT WITH THE CASTERS STATE PAYMENT IN ROUGHLY AND I'M SORRY I SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR THAT'S OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES NOT OVER THE INFINITE TIME HORIZON BUT OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES. SO IN FACT OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES -- ON THE STATE ARE PAYMENT FORECASTERS THERE'S A 15220% CHANCE THAT THE STATE WOULD ACTUALLY ACHIEVE NO SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THAT ONE BILLION DOLLARS SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. THINKING -- THEN NEXT SORT OF SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW THE CALPERS CONTRIBUTION WOULD WORK. THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENTPLANS -- WITHIN CALPERS THOSE EACH GET VARYING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND THEN OTHER FUNDS LIKE SPECIAL FUNDS -- THEY INCLUDE MISCELLANEOUS PEACE OFFICER AND FIREFIGHTERS AND HIGHWAY PATROL DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF EMPLOYEE -- HIS OF THE STATE. AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN AS WE CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY DIVIDE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AMONG THOSE PLANS ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH THE GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTES TO THEM. SO SINCE HIGHWAY PATROL DOESN'T HAVE ANY GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION IT WOULD NOT RECEIVE A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. BUT THE OTHER PLANS ALL WOOD AND THEN THE BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WOULD BE ACCRUED TO EACH OF THE PLANS THAT. RECEIVE THE PAYMENT ARE BOTH TO SPECIAL FUNDS AND TO THE GENERAL FUND. TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE THIS PROVIDES TO SIR HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS -- ON EACH OF THESE PROPOSALS. THINKING ABOUT THE TRADE OFF BETWEEN CALPERS AND CAL STIRS THIS IS REALLY A QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS IF THE GOAL OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT IS TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMS WENT UNFUNDED LIABILITIES ACROSS THE BOARD AT BOTH SYSTEMS. THEN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES ACHIEVE BACK ON BUT IF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE A PRIMARY GOAL TO ACHIEVE STATE SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES. AND POSSIBLY A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO CALPERS VERSUS CAL STIRS WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE. ON THINKING ABOUT THE CALPERS CONTRIBUTION SPECIFICALLY WE THINK IT'S BEST TO MAXIMIZE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS WHEN USING GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. AND WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION IN ORDER TO DO THAT. ONE WOULD BE TO MAKE THE ENTIRE THREE BILLION OR WHATEVER AMOUNT. OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT DIRECTLY TO ONE PLAN THE PEACE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS FUND BECAUSE IT'S NEARLY ENTIRELY GENERAL FUND SUPPORTED. BUT THAT WOULD OF COURSE CREE PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT FOR ONE PLAN VERSUS ALL OF THE OTHERS AND SO A SECOND OPTION WOULD BE TO STILL MAKE THE CONTRIBUTION AMONG ALL FIVE PLANS INCLUDING HIGHWAY PATROL WHICH IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BENEFIT UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. BUT THEN REQUIRE THE SPECIAL FUNDS TO FUND FOR THEIR SHARES OF THE LOAN. SPECIAL FUNDS WOULD ACTUALLY STILL BE BETTER OFF ON THAT BECAUSE THEY WOULD ACHIEVE THE GREATER SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCED RATES. BUT THE GENERAL FUND WOULD STILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAXIMIZE ITS OWN BENEFIT. JUST VERY BRIEFLY WE ALSO RECOMMEND MAKING IS TRANSFERS LATER IN THE FISCAL YEAR. IN PLANNING DOCUMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED THAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE THESE -- TRANSFERS IN JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL TO CALPERS IMPOSTERS -- AND GIVEN THAT EVERY YEAR REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS ARE INHERENTLY ON CERTAIN WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO WAIT FOR KEY REVENUE MONTHS INCLUDING DECEMBER JANUARY IN APRIL. FOR THE STATE TO JUST ENSURE THAT THE SURPLUS IS INDEED AVAILABLE BEFORE COMMITTING TO THESE TRANSFERS ONCE THESE TRANSFERS ARE MADE TO THE SYSTEMS THAT CANNOT BE TAKEN BACK SO. IT'S AN IMPORTANT. MOMENT. FINALLY AT BY JUST TO DISCUSS THE BUDGETARY BORROWING PROPOSALS ON THE LAST PAGE. THE GOVERNOR HAS TWO MAJOR PROPOSALS TO REPAY BUDGETARY BORROWING. ONE IS -- AS ALREADY MENTIONED ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO REPAY OUTSTANDING SPECIAL FUND LOANS THIS WOULD ELIMINATE THE CURRENT MULTI YEAR PLAN THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. TO REPAY THOSE LOANS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND THEN THE USE THAT THAT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR CASTERS PAYMENTS. THE SECOND PROPOSAL IS TO USE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND ON DUE TO BUDGETARY DEFERRALS -- JUST ADDING A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL TO THOSE JUNE JULY PAYROLL AND CALPERS FOURTH QUARTER JUNE JULY PAYROLL TO FOR ALL DOES NOT AFFECT PAVE. HEY ROLE IN ANYWAY SO DOES NOT AFFECT EMPLOYEES JACK'S IT'S JUST AN ACCOUNTING -- MECHANISM. AND A BOTH OF THESE DEFERRALS ACTUALLY ACHIEVE ON GOING SAVINGS FOR THE GENERAL FUND AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE PAYROLL GROWS OVER TIME AND PENSION COSTS GROW OVER TIME SO PAYING FOR THE PREVIOUS JUNE OF THE PREVIOUS FOURTH QUARTERS. PAYROLL OR TRY OUR CALPERS PAYMENT IS A LITTLE BIT CHEAPER THAN FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. SO THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION AN ONGOING GENERAL CHIEF STRUCK BY HAVING THESE IN PLACE AND I'M DOING THEM WOULD UNDO THAT A GENERAL FUND BENEFIT. SO JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THESE WE DO RECOMMEND PRIORITIZING RETIREMENT LIABILITIES OVER THE SPECIAL FUND LOANS USING TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY OFF SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH HIGHER INTEREST LIKE MAKING AN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO CALPERS. VERSES REPAYING A SPECIAL PHONE LINES WOULD SAY THE STATE AT LEAST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- AND THEN THE STATE COULD STILL MAINTAIN ITS EXISTING ON MULTI YEAR PLAN TO REPAY THOSE SPECIAL FROM LOANS. AND THEN SECOND WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL TO UNDO THESE DEFERRALS -- FIRST BECAUSE IT DOES ELIMINATE THAT GENERAL FUND SAVINGS THAT IS ONGOING AND IN FACT IF MONEY IS HOLDEN RESERVES AND THAT THERE CAN BE. A LITTLE BIT OF INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO -- IF THE GOAL IS TO BUILD MORE BUDGET RESILIENCY AND TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE A RESERVE THEN THEY'RE JUST -- MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS OF KEEPING UP WITH ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION. BASIC QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL -- THE END OF THE ENTIRE PANEL MISTER UGH TORONTO FROM -- CALPERS THANK YOU MA'AM -- GOOD MORNING. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS COMMITTEES -- SCOTT TREND OF CALPERS -- I JUST HAVE A FEW -- AND CHECK IN GENERAL AND THAT PASSED ALONG TO KERRY WORK AND WHO WILL GIVE -- A BIT MORE SPECIFICS ON THE CONTRIBUTION THE PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION -- A. R. P. AND WE FEEL THAT -- THE CART THE PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR RETIREMENT SYSTEM. IT PROVIDES A SECURITY FOR PROMISED BENEFITS FOR THE MEMBERS AND INCREASES THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE FUND IT ALSO. BASED ON OUR OUR ANALYSIS AND SO CASTING PROJECTION SAVES THE STATE A FAIRLY DECENT AMOUNT OF MONEY. IN ADDITION THE ADDITIONAL -- CHANGES TO THE DEFERRALS -- WE THINK ARE ALSO A GOOD IDEA -- IT MENTIONS THAT. THREE IS -- WHAT'S ONLY IN THE COUNTY CHANGE IT DOES END UP SAVING THE STATE SOME MONEY ON A LONG TERM BASIS. AND HOW -- IS GOING TO PASS ON TO CARRY HE'S AGAINST SOME OF MORE THE MORE THE DETAILS ON HOW MUCH TO SAVE MEANS WE ANTICIPATE AND WE SEE FROM THESE THAT THREE BILLION DOLLAR. THE THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE NUANCES ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THAT SO CLASSICS SIMULATION. THANK YOU [inaudible] HE'S GOT -- YEAH WE'RE JUST GOING. TO START WITH A HIGH LEVEL LOOK AT THIS RIGHT NOW IS THAT FOR THE STATE IN AN AGGREGATE WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN BILLION OF UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. AND WE SET UP A NUMBER TO STATION SCHEDULE OVER THE NEXT THIRTY THE MINIMUM REQUIRED PAYMENTS. SO WHAT YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY DOING BY MAKING AN ADDITIONAL THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT HIS FAST TRACKING PAYING MORE THAN THE MINIMUM AND YOU'RE SAVING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INTEREST. ON THAT OF SENDING LONG. FOR CHARGING EFFECTIVELY THE DISCOUNT RATE OF 7%. SO IT IS 7% RATE YOU'RE MAKING AN INVESTMENT EFFECTIVELY AND CREDITING YOURSELF BACK 27%. SO AND HAS TALKED ABOUT THE ONE APPROACH WE LOOKED AT WAS ASSUME THE FUN WAS EARNING 7% EVERY YEAR. THAT YOU MADE THE EXTRA PAYMENT. UNDER THAT APPROACH. OF FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS REDUCED BY SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION OVER THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. SO THE SEVEN POINT TO NET OF THE THREE BILLION THAT YOU PAID UP FRONT. GENERATES A SAVINGS OF FOUR POINT TWO BILLION [inaudible] THE OUR OTHER POINTED AND MADE IS THAT WE'D ALSO DISTANCE TO CASTING WHICH IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT THE FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY GONNA EARN. WE KNOW THERE'S UPS AND DOWNS IN THE MARKETS WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA EARN 7% EVERY YEAR. AS WE GO FOR FOR THIRTY YEARS WHAT WE DO BELIEVE OVER THE AGGREGATE ABOUT A SOME PERCENT RETURN IS EXPECTED. UNDER THE STOCHASTIC SIMULATIONS WE BASICALLY RUN. OUR MODEL RANDOMIZED MODEL TO GENERATE RETURNS. EACH YEAR FOR THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS AND THERE'S A FILE IRAN. UNDER THE THOUSAND SIMULATIONS. AND WE PROVIDED PERCENTILE BREAKDOWNS BUT UNDER THE FIFTIETH MEDIAN PERCENTILE. WE GENERATED SIX POINT TWO BILLION OF NET SAVINGS. SO WAS IT ACTUALLY ADDITIONAL SAVINGS UNDER SOME OF THE RANDOMIZED VIEW OF OF THE MARKET RENT. SO. AND HERE WE ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE RELATING TO SOMEBODY YESTERDAY ESTIMATES WE PROVIDED -- HIM WITHOUT WILL PASS BACK. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT WILL MOVE ON TO DAVID LARUE WITH CASTERS. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THOUGH THEY HAVE A LOT MORE OF FROM THE CAL STAR IS GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY -- BEFORE I START JUST WANTED TO COME TO GIVE SOME BACKGROUND TO EVERYONE -- CALISTO IS WILL LITTLE BIT. MAYES STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY THAN CALPERS WHEN IT COMES TO A FUNDING HISTORICALLY. CASTOR SAYS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SET CONTRIBUTION RATES TO PROPERLY FUND. ARE THE BENEFITS FOR TEACHERS. FOLLOWING THE AWAY TWO NINE FINANCIAL CRISIS MCALISTER'S STARTED TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDER IN THE LEGISLATURE IN A WARM AND THE WHOLE WORLD. UNLESS SOMETHING WERE TO CHANGE WE WERE EXPECTED. TO DEPLETE OUR ASSETS WITHIN A THIRTY THE ON THE ROAD INSOLVENCY TO HAVE NO ASSETS. THROUGH LIKE. A THROAT MULTIPLE YEARS OF DISCUSSION WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE AT LANDMARK LEGISLATION WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE GAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. RATE SETTING AUTHORITY TO OUR BOARD TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST CONTRIBUTION RATES TO PUT US ON A PATH TO WORK FULL FUND. SAID THE PLAN WAS PASSED WITH THE DESIRE TO FUND THE OR ELIMINATE OR UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY SIX SO WE HAVE A FUNDING PERIOD THAT IS FIXED IN STATUTE. THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS ALL OVER THERE YOU STAKEHOLDERS ALL AGREED TO CONTRIBUTE MORE TO THE CALLOUSED OUR SYSTEM. MEMBERS TODAY OF PAYING 2% MORE OUT OF THEIR SATTAR WITHIN THE DID BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THE USED TO PAY ABOUT MORE THAN 10% OF THEIR SALARIES. THE STATE ALSO AGREED TO PAY MUCH MORE. AN EMPLOYER IS ALSO AGREED TO PAY MORE EMPLOYERS CONTRIBUTED EIGHT AND A QUARTER OF A PERCENT OF EACH OF THEIR EMPLOYEES SATURDAY. FOR ABOUT FORTY YEARS AND THAT CONTRIBUTION RATE IT IS SET IN STATUTE AS SCHEDULE WAS AGREED UPON THAT CONTRIBUTION RATE IS SLOWLY INCREASING. THEIR CURRENTLY PAYING JUST OVER SIXTEEN PER IT'S SCHEDULED TO GO TO NINETEEN POINT 1%. SOMEONE USE YOUR SOMETIME MEDIA STORIES OVER -- EMPLOYERS MAY BE HAVING A HARD TIME TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE CAST WAS CONTRIBUTION IT IS THE SCHEDULE THAT WAS AGREED UPON IN THE COSTUMES FUNDING PLAN IT IS SET IN STATUTE. NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATE THE STATE ALSO AGREED TO PAY MORE AND SO OUR BOARD WAS GIVEN AUTHORITY. TO ADJUST CONTRIBUTION RATES GOING FORWARD FOR BOTH THE EMPLOYERS AND THE STATE IF IT WAS DETERMINED THAT. CONTRIBUTIONS NEED TO TO BE INCREASED TO REACH FOR FUNDING BY TWO THOUSAND FORTY SIX AND THIS IS WHERE IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU SEE. WHY A IN SOME SITUATIONS ELLIE -- IS SAYING THAT THERE MAY NOT BE AS MUCH SAVINGS. IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE THE MONEY NOW CLARIFIED TO SIT IN THE SECOND. OR BOARD WAS GIVEN THE ABILITY TO ADJUST FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION RATE. BY NO MORE THAN A HALF A PERCENT OF PAYROLL IN ANY GIVEN YEAR IF IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CONTRIBUTIONS NEEDED TO INCREASE IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. SO TODAY WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITY IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVEN BILLION THAT'S THE LATEST FIGURE THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO OUR BOARD. AND YOU STILL HAVE A PACKET IN FRONT OF YOU. IF YOU OPENED A PACKET WE HAVE A TWO PIECES OF PAPER. ON ONE OF THEM YOU WILL SEE A SHEET THAT HAS THE PIGGY BANK ON IT ANY PIE CHART. IF YOUR INTERESTED SO THE THE HUNDRED AND SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR OF UNFUNDED LIABILITY WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM TODAY. ABOUT THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE AND ABOUT SEVENTY ONE BILLION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE EMPLOYERS. THE STATE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE PROPOSING A PAYMENT OF ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO REDUCE THE CEMENT. SO HERE IS WHERE -- TO DEMEAN MESSAGE WILL BEEN TELLING EVERYONE ALWAYS BE SAVINGS FROM ANY CONTRIBUTION THAT ARE SENT THE CALLOUSED OR IS TO REDUCE THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. FOR WHAT IS ON CERTAIN WITH US BECAUSE OUR BOARD HAS LIMITED THE RATE SETTING AUTHORITY. IS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SET CONTRIBUTION RATES TO LEVELS THAT REFLECT THE LUMP SUM RECEIVED BY THE STATE. TO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. TODAY WE ARE WE ARE STILL NOT COLLECTING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SHOULD BE COLLECTING TO ELIMINATE THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. BECAUSE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE STILL SCHEDULED TO INCREASE IT SET IN STATUTE SO FOR THE STATE TO WE ARE ABOUT FOUR YEARS AWAY. FROM BEING AT THE LEVEL THAT WE NEED TO IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR OF UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY SIX WITH THE PROPOSAL'S PAYMENTS. OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WE EXPECT THAT WE WON'T NEED THE LAST YEAR OF THE INCREASES SUE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS PROPOSAL. IF YOU JUST IF THE GOAL IS TO HAVE SAVINGS EVERY SINGLE YEAR FOR THE STATE IN THEIR IN THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO CAL STAR IS FROM THIS LUMP SUM. IT MOST LIKELY WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT RIGHT NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS THE CONTRIBUTION RATE IS GOING TO BE THE SAME WHAT ARE WE GET A LUMP SUM OR NOT. IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE FORTY HERE THAT THE STATE MAY START RECEIVING SAVINGS. NOW ONCE YOU START LOOKING AT THE ONCE YOU START LOOK AT A REAL WORLD SITUATION WE ON THE WIN IF WE LIVE IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD WE ALL KNOW THAT INVESTMENT MARKETS GO UP AND DOWN. AND IF YOU LOOK YOU KNOW NONE OF US KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY GO TO TWO DECADES OF RETURNS BI LO WHAT WE ISSUE MCALISTER'S WE CURRENTLY ASSUME 7%. UNDER SUCH SCENARIO IF WE WERE TO EARN LEXUS SIX AND A HALF OR AT CAL STAR IS BECAUSE OF OUR LIMITED RATE SETTING AUTHORITY AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND. OR BOARD. WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION RATE BY HALF A PERCENT EACH YEAR. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE NOT SO THE QUESTION IS. IS THE LUMP SUM GOING TO GENERATE SAVINGS. THE ANSWER IS YES IT TWELVE BUT WHAT IS ON CERTAIN IS THE TIMING WHEN EXACTLY AND I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE MAY BE. THERE MAY NOT BE ANY SAVINGS FOR THE FIRST TEN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS BECAUSE OF FOR LET'S SEE WE GO THROUGH A PERIOD OF LOW RETURNS. THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY WILL ACCUMULATE OVER TIME AND ANY MONEY WE GET TODAY YOU CAN BE SURE THAT EVEN IF THE STATE HAS YET TO EXPERIENCE ANY SAVINGS. YOU CAN EXPECT THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY IF WE STILL HAVE ONE BY TWO THOUSAND FORTY SIX IS GOING TO BE AT LEAST FOUR FIVE TIMES LOWER THAN THE PAYMENT WE RECEIVED FROM THE STATE. SO IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE ONE BILLION. EVEN IF THE STATE DOES NOT EXPRESS ANY SAY LONG TERM THAT WE SAVINGS AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY SIX IT MAY MEAN THAT YOU UNFUNDED LIABILITY THIS THE THE THE SHARE THAT THE STATE IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR MAYBE LARA BY FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO SAVINGS WILL ALWAYS BE REALIZE BUT WHAT'S ON CERTAIN WITH US IS. ONE AND WITH THIS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. EXCELLENT BEFORE I OPEN IT UP TO MEMBERS -- MISTER VISWANATHA ON YOU WANT TO RESPOND ANYTHING YOU HEARD BEFORE I COLLEAGUES TO MAKE COMMENTS. I THINK ONLY FILL IF YOU WANT. TO BELIEVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY. NOTHING SHOULD BE OKAY OKAY PERFECT -- LET ME ASK A QUICK QUESTION FIRST AND I'M GONNA PUT OVER TO SENATOR PAN FOLLOWED BY MINING FOLLOWED BY MORE LOT -- THE LA -- NOTES THAT -- PROPOSING THIS SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR TRANSFERRED CALPERS AND CAL STIRS IN JULY WOULD. LIMIT THE STATE'S FLEXIBILITY AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS AROUND. CASH DEFICITS ARE CASH FLOW ISSUES AND IF SO WHAT. WOULD BE YOUR PLAN TO MITIGATE. SO THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS OF THAT IN THE FIRST DAYS -- SO FOR THE PURPOSE PAYMENT IT'S COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND SURPLUS AND FOR THE SISTERS CAME AND THIS IS THE PART THAT IS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE RATHER THAN THE SCHOOLS. THAT'S COMING UNDER PROP -- TO PAYMENT BY THIS FORMULA IN THE CONSTITUTION SO AS OUR REVENUES ARE UPDATED IN MAY AND THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IN JUNE. THAT ACTUAL LEVEL WHICH WERE RIGHT NOW ESTIMATING AT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION OVERALL FOR PROP TO DEBT PAYMENTS OF WHICH ONE POINT ONE WERE RIGHT NOW THINKING WE WILL DEVOTE TO STIRS. ABOUT WILL FLUCTUATE SO WE WILL BE BACK WITH AN UPDATED ESTIMATE IN MAY SO THAT THERE'S A BUILT IN MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS IN LINE WITH WHAT WE CAN AFFORD. IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR CALPERS ON THERE THERE'S A TRADE OFF SO ON THE ONE HAND IF YOU DELAY THAT PAYMENT AND MAKE IT LATER IN THE YEAR INTO THE NEXT YEAR -- THEN THAT CAN GIVE YOU ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO ADJUSTED. AT THE SAME TIME -- FOR EXACTLY THE REASONS WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE INVESTMENT RETURN RATE EVERY MONTH THAT YOU DELAY PUTTING THAT MONDAY AT THAT MONEY AND IT'S A MONEY WHERE YOU'RE NOT EARNING THE RIGHT ON THAT AND AND WITH THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN OR EVEN A SMALL DATA THAT'S THAT'S A LOT. OF MONEY -- SO THAT'S THE TRADE OFF THAT WE WERE THINKING OUT IN TERMS OF SCHEDULING THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE [inaudible] THIRTY PM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I ONCE AGAIN THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS -- USED FOR THE QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH -- THE ACTUALLY THE SAFETY NET RESERVES -- SO YOU KNOW YOU -- THEN THE DESIRE FOR FLEX FLEXIBILITY HOWEVER -- I ALSO WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- WE DO HAVE A PARTICULAR PURPOSE FOR THIS FIND AND IF THERE AREN'T SOME PARAMETERS. THEN IT BASICALLY REALLY AND HE HAS A DIFFERENT TITLE THAT FALLS INTO THE WASH. AND AT LEAST IN. MY MIND AND CERTAINLY ARE -- BUDGET CHAIR OF SOMEONE THE CREW -- BEYOND THAT I SEE THE INNOVATOR OF THE FUND THAT -- IS SO SHE CAN CORRECT ME IF I MAKE ANY ERRORS -- I I DO KNOW WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT BASICALLY WE HAVE A COUNTER CYCLICAL ISSUE WITH THE STATE BUDGET RATE OUR REVENUES ARE HIGHER WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD OUR NEEDS ARE GREATER WHEN TIMES ARE BAD. AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENS ON JERRY BROWN TALKED TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT -- THAT OFTEN TIMES -- SOCIAL SERVICES PARTICULARLY THINGS LIKE OUR EXIT CUT FIRST. RATE AND WE KNOW THAT -- THAT OFFICE HE TO DEMAND GOES UP BECAUSE IF MORE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE SERVICES CAL AND I CAUGHT WORKS ARE MEDI CAL -- SO I I GUESS I WOULD URGE. SOME THINKING AND CERTAINLY WE WANT TO DO THAT TO DO WITH THE WORKING TOGETHER ON TRYING TO SET SOME -- PARAMETERS THAT REALLY REFLECT. THE GOALS OF THIS -- AFTER THIS -- SAFETY NET RESERVE AND AND AND TO ME IT WOULD BE -- PERHAPS SOME MORE BASED ALONG YOU DON'T EAT IT CAN INCREASE DEMAND BASED ON INCREASE ENROLLMENT RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE HAVE FEWER PEOPLE ARE CAO WORKS BECAUSE ECONOMIES GOOD JOBS ARE OPERATE. IT GOES THE OTHER WAY AND SO AS THE NUMBERS INCREASE. WE DON'T WORK YOU KNOW FIND YOURSELVES WERE BOTH CUTTING THE AMOUNT AND ONE THAT ALSO WE'D START ENGAGING AND FRANKLY -- VARIOUS TACTICS TO TRY TO DRIVE MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO EVEN AND ROLE FOR THE SERVICES. LET'S JUST BE REALLY BUT WE CAME OF SOME PRETTY CRAZY IDEAS WHICH I WON'T REITERATE THAT I REMEMBER FROM THE TIME I AND I THINK A CENTER MITCHELL BOTH OF US CAME TO SIMPLY AT THE SAME TIME IN. TWENTY TEN AND SO WE'D LIKE TO AVOID THAT. RIGHT -- WE WE WE WE WHEN PEOPLE NEED THE PROGRAM IS NOT WHEN WE SHOULD BE THROWING UP MORE BARRIERS RIGHT SO WE SHOULD SO. TO ME IN MY MIND WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT SOME PARAMETERS BASED ON IT AGAIN WE SEE LARGER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE NEEDING TO SIGN UP FOR THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE RESERVED ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN THAT. THAT LEVEL OF YOU KNOW SERVICE -- TO TO TO TO THOSE FOLKS SO -- ABOUT HOPING THAT THAT THE FINANCE WILL WORK WITH US IS ONLY ONE LA AS ASSISTANCE AS WELL. IN TRYING TO SET SOME PARAMETERS BECAUSE I APPRECIATE FLEXIBILITY BUTIT WE AND I APPRECIATE AGAIN I WANT THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING IN YOU KNOW MAKING THE SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT TO THE STATE THAT RESERVE. BUT IF THE STATEMENT RESERVE DOESN'T HAVE SOME. PARAMETERS AND CONCEPTS THAT WE UNDERSTOOD WE COMMONLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS FOR I'M AFRAID THE NEXT RECESSION IT BECOMES JUST PART OF THE WASH SO. YES THE TWO QUICK POINTS ON THAT FIRST I WANT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE I KNOW I MENTIONED THE WORD FLEXIBILITY BUT THE SAFETY NET RESERVE A SEAT FOR CAL WORKS AND IT'S FOR MEDI CAL. NOT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THAT IS THE THE PURPOSE WHY THE SAFETY NET RESERVE WAS CREATED IN AS YOU NOTED WITH THE RAINY DAY FUND. FROM POP TO THAT IS MORE MUCH MORE GENERAL AND THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON IT YOU KNOW. NO MORE THAN 50% IN THE FIRST YEAR CAN BE DEPOSITED IN A BUDGET EMERGENCY FROM THE RAINY DAY FUND INTO THE GENERAL FUND BUT THAT IS FOR EVERYTHING BUT WE'RE WELL AWARE OF THAT HISTORY'S WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THIS FUNDING IS JUST FOR THOSE TWO PROGRAMS OKAY. OKAY SO. LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION ACTION THAT YOU BELIEVE ME AS A SUMMER DECISION TAKEN MEDI CAL A SOURCE CARE ABOUT MEDI CAL BUT I THINK CAL WORKS EVEN MORE VULNERABLE YES SO LET'S HAVE THAT DISCUSSION -- THE SECOND THING I WANT TO MENTION IS I APPRECIATE THE LA JOH. AS AGAIN ACTUAL PUSHING FLEXIBILITY I ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE IDEA OF LET'S PAY OFF THOSE DEBTS THE SPECIAL FUNDS LET'S GET RID OF THE FOR ALL RIGHT -- AND TO TELL THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA LOOK WE'VE ON WILD ALL THESE THINGS DOWN THEN AGAIN THEY HAVE BECOME PART OF THE TOOL BOX IN CASE WE DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH A SEVERE RECESSION. BUT I I DO -- ONE OF I DO I MENTION THE POINT THOUGH AND I AND I GET ALSO APPRECIATE THE CONTRIBUTION TO CALPERS. BUT THIS IDEA THAT THE TO THE SAME WAY THAT WE HALF THE SPECIAL THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND IT BENEFITS THE SPECIAL FUNDS THAT THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED LOANS TO THE SPECIAL FUNDS THAT. WHEN -- THAT IF IT THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT WE GET PAID BACK EVENTUALLY FOR THOSE -- AND IS IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE THEY'LL SPECIAL FUNDS LOAN TO US WHEN WE NEEDED THEM BECAUSE THEY HAD SOME OF THOSE POTS OF MONEY AVAILABLE WHEN WE NEED TO HELP BRIDGE A RECESSION SO. I WANT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS -- CONCEPT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP THAT THE AB AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT WE DO MAKE THESE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS BUT THAT. TO PROVIDE ACTUALLY TO INCREASE OUR LONG TERM FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF OF WHAT YOU KNOW WE BORROW FOR THEM SOMETIMES WE NEED BUT VICE VERSA I LIKE WE'RE HELPING THEM AND IT'S IT IS A NET BENEFIT STILL TO THE SPECIAL FUNDS THAT WE DOING THIS FOR THEM. SO WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT YES SO BASICALLY WHEN WE WHEN THE GOVERNOR PUT TOGETHER THE PROPOSAL TEAM WANTED TO SAVE TAXPAYERS MONEY AND SAVE OUR STATE MONEY AND HE WAS THINKING OF THAT. ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE BIG THREE TAXES THAT'S WHERE THEY FLOW INTO VERSUS SPECIAL UNDS WHICH ARE MOSTLY FUNDED BY FEES AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. SO THAT IS OUR INTENT -- WE ARE STILL STRUCK SO THE LA OF THE I AGREE WITH WHEN IT COMES TO STRUCTURING THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED BECAUSE AS MISS ALWAYS HAD MENTIONED ENOUGH. FOR THE C. H. P. IT'S ALL FUNDED BY SPECIAL FINE WITH THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT BUT FOR OTHER FUNDS THERE'S A DIFFERENT PROPORTION FOR EACH. SO THAT SOMETHING IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON THAT MECHANISM BUT THE INTENTION IS FOR THOSE PAYMENTS TO BE MADE ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL FUND. OKAY. ALL RIGHT AND THEN -- FINALLY -- SO IF YOU'VE PREVIOUSLY CHAIR TIA PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT TIME ACTIVITY. APPRECIATE THE UP FRONT -- BESIDE THE AGAIN PRETTY TAKING SOME OF OUR TIMES IN OUR PROCESS HAS PAYING DOWN OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITIES -- IN TERMS OF OUR PENSIONS OTHER THIS IS KIND OF LIKE RIGHT SO WHAT EXPECT SOMEONE IN THEIR TWENTIES UNLESS THEY REALLY HIT IT RICH THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE FULLY FUNDED THEIR RETIREMENT. WHILE THEY'RE IN THE TWENTIES OR THIRTIES RIGHT WE WE BUILD UP TOWARD RETIREMENT PEOPLE ARE ALL RETIRING AT THE SAME TIME -- SO EIGHT SWIMBAIT NOTED THAT WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT FUNDED LIABILITIES -- THE THE OTHER THING IN BUT I I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON IS I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS STUFF CASTING MODELING. IN MANY WAYS WHAT WE DO IS. WELL WE CAN PICK OUT NUMBER BUT REALLY IT'S LIKE A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS RIGHT AND SO -- SO IN TERMS OF THE AND INVESTMENT WHAT'S THE WHAT WOULD BE BAYSIDE SO CASTING MOLLY MAYBE OUT OF THE OF NUMBER FRONT OF YOU. THE PROBABILITY IN WHICH ACTUALLY WEWOULD HAVE A POSITIVE SAVINGS -- FOR THE UP FRONT MONEY THAT WE PUT IN SO WE'RE PROJECTING THAT ON AVERAGE SHE SAID FIFTY PERCENTILE SIX POINT TWO BILLION -- BUT SOME PEOPLE SAY WLL THERE'S POSSIBLY YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THAT TO THE ECONOMY THAT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT Là SO WHAT KIND OF PERCENT SO WHAT CAP PERCENTAGE ARE WE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF PROBABILITY OF AGAIN THESE ARE ALL PROBABILITIES WE CAN'T PREDICT. THE FUTURE -- THAT MOVING FORWARD OBVIOUSLY VERY REMOTE THEY'RE ALL* SAVING STILL AT THAT POINT ANOTHER TO GREATER THAN 99% CHANCE THAT WE'LL STATUS. THIRTY YEARS THAT'S RIGHT YEARS OKAY THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW THANK YOU. FRESH. FORGOT TO DO IN MY TWENTIES DOCTOR PAN PHILLY FOR MY RETIREMENT. YOU SEE THE DOCTOR PAN YOU SHOULD OF CALL ME A YEAH YOU SHOULD TOLD ME EXACTLY. SENATOR MONEY DID YOU FORGET ALSO ON YOUR TWENTY SEVEN THE MONEY. HE AND THEN IT SOMEBODY BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT WE HAVE NO PENSION IS SO AND WE DON'T THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD ACTUALLY. RECORD THEN OF THESE VOTES BENEFIT US IN ANY MANNER AT SURVIVOR THAT'S RIGHT SENATOR MODERATE -- SO PICKING UP A LITTLE BIT ON SENATOR PAM I THINK TO THE LA -- FIRST AND THEN. OTHERS AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE. THREE THE OPTIONS YOU FRAMED WE COULD PUT MORE IN CASH RESERVE AND THEN IT SEEMED LIKE THAT WAS KIND OF JUXTAPOSED. TO PUTTING MORE INTO BUILDING DOWN SOME OF THESE LIABILITIES IN THE RETIREMENT PROGRAMS -- IN I THINK YOU PARTIALLY ANSWERED THIS BUT IF WE IS THERE ANY HYBRID IN OTHER WORDS IF IF WE MAKE A LARGER INVESTMENT. IN PAYING DOWN THE LIABILITIES AND THE RETIREMENT FUNDS AND THEN WE HIT A RECESSION. IN THE MARKET [inaudible] FALLS. DO WE JEOPARDIZE HAVING FRONT LOADED -- SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES VERSES IF WE PROTECTED SOME OF THEM IN. IN SAVINGS ACCOUNT SIR IN. MADE THAT INVESTMENT OVER TIME I KNOW EARNING LESS. BY THAT DISTRIBUTION BUT HELP ME UNDERSTAND. ACT HOW DO WE FIND THAT THAT CORRECT WERE MOST BENEFICIAL BALLOT SO START WITH LA -- AND OTHERS MAY HAVE THOUGHTS ON THAT. YES SO -- THIS THIS IS DEFINITELY THE TRADE OFF IS THE RISK VERSUS -- REWARD OR RISK FORCES RETURN -- SO. I'LL JUST MAKE A COUPLE POINTS ABOUT THIS. THIS WOULD BE THERE WOULD BE A VARIETY OF INVESTMENT STRATEGIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROBABLY TAKE WITH RESPECT TO THESE FUNDS THEY WOULD BE INVESTED MOST LIKELY IN -- A TYPE OF FUND THAT WOULD EARN A LOWER RETURN THAN THE TYPICAL CALPERS INVESTMENT RETURN OF FOR THE TYPICAL ASSUMED INVESTMENT RETURN OF 7% EITHER BE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER. THAT RANGE FROM YOU KNOW HIGHER RETURN MORE RISK TO LOWERED RETURN LESS RISK ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE BRING THIS PROPOSAL UP NOW. IS THAT BOTH STATE MIGHT HAVE NOW ACTUALLY IT DOES PROVIDE A BIT OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS OPTION TO BE USED -- MORE FLEXIBLY IN THE FUTURE AND SO BY THAT I MEAN SAY THE STATE ANSWERS A RECESSION AND TWENTY TWENTY THE CASH RESERVES COULD BE USED FIRST TO COVER A BUDGET PROBLEM WHILE FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE SUFFERING AND YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY THE VALUE OF THIS ACCOUNT IS DOWN. AND THEN SAY IN THE SECOND YEAR OF THE RECESSION ONCE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE RECOVERED AND HOPEFULLY THE VALUE OF THIS ACCOUNT HAS RECOVERED THEN THE LEGISLATURE COULD OPT TO USE THAT -- SO PART OF THE REASON THAT WE BRING UP THIS IS BEING AN OPTION THAT'S PERHAPS MORE ATTRACTIVE NOW IS BECAUSE THE STATE HAS SOME MATCHING CASH RESERVES. THANK YOU IN. OTHERS ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT HAD HAD YOU. WHAT'S THE BEST APPORTIONMENT. TO AND TO HEDGE AGAINST THE RISK OF PUTTING TOO MUCH XIN ACCOUNTS ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDED FROM THAT ANSWER. THERE'S SOME DISCRETION WITHIN THE INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS AS WELL BETWEEN HIGHER RISK IN IN. LOWER RISK -- MORE GUARANTEED RETURN BOND MARKETS OR SOMETHING RIGHT -- I THINK YOU YOU LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WE WILL KEEP IT CASH RESERVES AND HAVE A LOWER RETURN -- IF YOU PUT IT IN THE WITH PREPAY RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS YOU DO HAVE -- THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATER GREATER CATCH OF THE GREAT RETURNS ON THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS -- THAT -- YOU THINK WELL IF IT'S AN CASH RESERVES IT'S NOT COMMITTED TO PERS IT'S COMMITTED YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY FOR ANYTHING. BUT LOWER RETURNS IF YOU PUT IT IN THE IF YOU PRE PUT IN THE PREPAYMENT A CAL. IT'S BASICALLY A COMMITMENT OFFERS RITAM PENSION PLANS. FOR POTENTIAL READ REDUCTION OF YOUR REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS AT YOUR CHOOSING YOU SAW THAT FLEXIBILITY AND THEN YOU GET TO THAT THIRD OPTION WHERE YOU MAKE THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WHICH IS A ONE TIME PAYMENT. MAKES EIGHT EIGHT LIKE A PERMANENT REDUCTION. IN THE CONTRIBUTION RATE GOING FORWARD. BUT YOU'LL HAVE A MORE FLEXIBLY AT THAT AT THAT POINT WE MAKE IT -- WE WE ADJUST THE RATES AT THAT POINT AND THEN. HE IF. YOU KNOW RECESSION WHERE THE CRACKER SAY SEVERAL YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. YOU. YOU YOU WOULD STILL LIKE TO MAKE THE REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS IF IT WAS SET IN THE PREPAYMENT ACCOUNT YOU CAN USE THAT TO OFFSET THE REQUIRED CONRIBUTION SO IT COMES DOWN. TO THERE'S NOT A RIGHT ANSWER IT IT'S WHAT DO YOU WHAT IS BEST FOR YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION AND HE COMES DOWN TO YOUR PARTICULAR NEEDS. THANK YOU OUTS MAKE TWO POINTS IN ADDITION TO THAT -- THE FIRST IS THE REASON THE ADMINISTRATION FOCUSED ON MAKING A SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTION EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW REDUCES DISCRETION IS. WE REALLY WANTED TO APPLY THAT TO THE LONG TERM LIABILITY MAKE SURE THE FUNDS AND ARE THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IT'S TRUE THAT THE MARKET CAN DECLINE BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND IS ANY AND VESTING ANY PERSON GIVING GOOD INVESTING ADVICE WILL. I YOU WANT TO START EARLY AND THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN CONTROL WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MARKET IS GOING TO GO BUT WE PUT THOSE FUNDS AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THAT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. BUT THE SECOND THING I THINK PREPAYMENT IS SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY IMPROVES FLEXIBILITY AND IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COULD CONSIDER IN THE YEARS TO COME. BUT EVEN THAT CAN COME AT A COST AND I KNOW -- THEY SPOKE ABOUT -- SOME THE COST THE OTHER COST IS ACTUALLY -- IF YOU'RE PREPAYING AND THEN IN A RECESSION YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT PREPAYMENT TO REDUCE YOUR CONTRIBUTION. THAT ALSO CAN COME OUT ACOSTA WARREN BUFFETT FAMOUS WE SAYS WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTING BE GREEDY WHEN OTHERS ARE FEARFUL YOUR FEARFUL WHEN OTHERS ARE GREEDY -- SO WHEN THE STATE IS REDUCING ITS ACTUARIAL YOU REQUIRED PAYMENT BY APPLYING A PREPAYMENT AT JUST THE POINT WHEN WE MIGHT BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MARKET. KNOW THAT CAN BE AND WE'VE ALL SENIOR CALPERS AND CAL STAR IS YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT THIS LONG HISTORY AND WE ALL LEARN FROM WHAT'S COMING THE CYCLES BEFORE. SO WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT YOU'RE MAKING YOUR PAYMENTS IN GOOD TIMES YOU'RE MAKING YOUR PAYMENTS IN BAD TIMES THOSE PAYMENTS IN BAD TIMES ARE PAINFUL FOR MAKING SURE IN A SIMILAR TO DOLLAR COST AVERAGING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR. THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGHOUT THE CYCLE SO THAT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BOTH THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM OF THE MARKET. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MORE LAW -- THIS ONE BY ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S. I'D LIKE TO PICK UP ON THIS VERY POINT IS SAY YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO MAKE A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT AND I'M ASSUME YOU'RE GOING. TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT -- AS AS AS PRESENTED A BUT YOU SAID WE NEED -- TO DETERMINE THE STRUCTURING OF THE PAYMENT SO COULD YOU. EXPAND ON THAT IT I I ALSO A PREFACE IT BY SAYING. WHAT THE ACTUARIES ARE PRETTY SAID WE'VE GOT? THE REGULAR FIND WOULD GET THE PREPAID CONTRIBUTION FUND WHICH IS -- BUT I'VE I'VE JUST CURIOUS. WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO HELP YOU? GET IT RIGHT INTO THE FRONT. END OF THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE THINKING A LOT ABOUT SO RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY PREPAYMENT -- FOR THAT CALPERS PROGRAM MORE FOR THE STATURE OF CAL STORES FOR THE SCHOOLS SHARE OF CAL STAR IS THERE'S A BIT OF A COMPLICATED MECHANISM. BECAUSE WERE MAKING PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOLS THAT SCHOOLS ARE APPLYING JUST FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND THE TWO REASONS THAT WE'RE DOING THAT. FUND THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SIDE IS NUMBER ONE MAKING SURE THAT THEY DO EXPERIENCE SAVINGS IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS WE KNOW THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE. UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE AND THE SECOND -- AS MISTER MEMBER MENTION THE CAL STIRS FUNDING PLAN THAT WAS ADOPTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IS VERY COMPLICATED AND IT WAS ADOPTED AFTER MANY YEARS OF WORK AND SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. OUR FUNDING -- SAVE SCHOOLS MONEY BUT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DICTATES OF THAT PROGRAM IN WHICH RATES FOR SCHOOLS DO NOT ACTUALLY FLUCTUATED SO I THINK AFTER TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR SIBLINGS SAVINGS OVER TERE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE STRUCTURING FOR THE CALPERS THAT YOU MENTIONED WE KNOW THAT WE WANT TO MAKE THAT THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT DIRECTLY -- AND NOT YOU KNOW THROUGH A PREPAYMENT MECHANISM. DESTRUCTION QUESTION IS HOW AMONG THE STATE'S DIFFERENCE FUNDS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MISS HAULING SAID MENTIONED HOW WE'RE APPLYING IT ACROSS THOSE FUNDS YOU KNOW BECAUSE CALPERS AS YOU KNOW. SERVES THE STATE AND AS WELL SO MANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS ACROSS -- BUT FOR THAT PORTION SOME OF THE PAYMENTS MADE TO CALPERS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR ARE ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL FUND AND SOMEWHERE ON BEHALF OF SPECIAL FUNDS AND AND I SENATOR PAN MENTIONED -- IF THE STATE IS MAKING A PAYMENT ON BEHALFOF THE SPECIAL FIND -- THAT CAN BE SEEN IN SOME WAYS IS A SUBSIDY FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE SPECIAL FUND AND THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO WE'RE LOOKING SIMPLY. TO SAY TAXPAYERS MONEY WHILE REDUCING THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. MAKING SURE THOSE PAYMENTS ARE ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL FUND ACROSS ALL THOSE FIVE CATEGORIES THAT MISS ALWAYS HAD MENTIONED SO CURRENTLY THE ACTUARIES. DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE CONTRIBUTION FOR THE PLAN SPONSOR. AND THE PLAN SPONSORS SAYS HEY I I WANT TO GET AHEAD OF THIS. I WANTED TO DO WE GET. WE GET SPECIAL CASH. AND NOW THEIR ONLY. OPTION IS -- ONE ONE FIVE TRUST. IS THERE A WAY WE CAN ASSIST IN ALLOWING PLAN SPONSORS. TO JUST CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT IT IN A CASH FOR UNDER ONE ONE FIVE IN JUST RIGHT IN. THERE ARE A MY MISUNDERSTANDING IS ALREADY THAT OPTION AVAILABLE. PLANS CAN CAN. CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS ANYTIME THEY NEED. TO NEED TO FOR FOR EXAMPLE -- I THINK WE WOULD THERE'S TWO TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE ONE THE ONE FIFTEEN TRUST. AND THEN THAT CAN BE APPLIED ONCE IT APPLIED. AND THEN THEN THERE'S ALSO THE OPTION OF OF MAKING ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS. DEAL DURING THE YEAR AND THEN WE WILL HAVE THIS DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR YOU KNOW IT IN THIS CASE THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE ON WHICH AVERAGES ATION BASES YOU WANT THOSE APPLY TO SO WE CAN GENERATE THE BIGGEST SAVINGS. AND AND YOU KNOW THAT OCCURRED WITH THIS BEFORE EIGHTY FOUR IN TERMS OF OF WHEN THAT DOES. THAT LARGE SIX BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT CAME IN. BOMB WHICH EVERY DECISION BASIS ARE WE GOING TO APPLY TO IS TO REDUCE THE RATES THAT OPTIONS ALWAYS AVAILBLE SO SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ONE FIFTEEN TRUSTS -- THE ONE FIFTEEN TRUST M. IS ACTUALLY A NEW THING -- THAT'S THAT'S AVAILABLE THIS YEAR FOR PURRS -- SO THAT'S BASICALLY ANOTHER OPTION THAT'S OUT THERE. OKAY THANK YOU THEN. OF MR THIS WANNA FIND YOU YOU ALSO MENTIONED. UP TO FUNDS COULD APPLY -- TO PEP -- IN YOU MENTIONED THE CAL STIRS LIABILITY COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT. A LITTLE MORE SLEAZY SICKLY -- WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING FOR PROP TWO IT'S ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLIONS WITH DIFFERENT CAB CALPERS FOR TYPICALLY STATE EMPLOYEES? VENDORS CAL STIRS WHICH MISTER WEBER MENTIONED OF WHICH THERE'S A LIABILITY OF A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH ABOUT. THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IS THE SCHOOL SHARE -- AND THEN WE HAVE THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY RELATED -- TO RETIREE HEALTH CARE FOR STATE EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS THEIR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES WERE PAYING IS A PAY AS YOU GO BASIS BUT WHO ARE ALSO. ACCUMULATING CREDITS WORD HEALTHCARE IN RETIREMENT AND SO THEY ARE THE MOST RECENT STATE COMPTROLLER'S REPORT -- ESTIMATED THAT UNFUNDED LIABILITY AT NINETY ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND I BELIEVE THE SCO THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WILL BE COMING OUT WITH AN UPDATED REPORT AT SOME POINT THIS YEAR -- BUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE STATE STARTED AND ITS BARGAINING. FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN PRI FUND THESE OBLIGATIONS AND WHITTLE DOWN THAT LIABILITY AND ACTUALLY THE SAME YEAR -- TWENTY FORTY SIX THAT WE MISTER WEBER MUCH FOR CAL STIRS WE HAVE THIS PLAN IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT BY THAT POINT ALL BENEFITS WILL BE KEEP PRETTY FUNDED AND WE'RE NO LONGER PAYING ON A PAY AS YOU GO BASIS BECAUSE THOSE COSTS HAVE BEEN RISING EVERY YEAR. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES -- SO THAT'S WHY IT'S ELIGIBLE FOR PROP TO FUNDING TRUST -- FOR PAD -- AND THEN THAT LAST CATEGORY OF THE PROP TWO PAYMENTS THAT'S THE CALPERS PAYMENT I'M SORRY TO CAL STIRS PAYMENT THE OPEC PAYMENT -- AND THEN THE LAST IS AS YOU REMEMBER TWO YEARS AGO WHEN WE TOOK OUT THAT LOAN -- TO PUT IN SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT INTO CALPERS -- THEY THINK MR TREND -- MENTIONED -- WE HAVE TO REPAY THAT LOAN -- THAT WE TOOK OUT FROM OUR SURPLUS MONEY INVESTMENT FUND SO THAT ALSO IS ELIGIBLE UNDER PROP TO SIT WE LOOK AT THAT AS A CENTURY OR CALPERS PAYMENT BECAUSE WERE REPAYING. THE MONEY HAT WE BORROWED TO PUT INTO CALPERS IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT ARE YOU GETTING LKE AT A BANK TO FOR YOUR BUCK YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE DOING PROP TWO RESERVES BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY PUTTING IT INTO. THESE RETIREMENT DEBTS. BUT WE HAVE TO PAY BACK. PROP TWO FOR WHAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO SO FOR THAT LAST PART THAT WAS A DECISION THAT THAT GOVERNOR BROWN IN THE LEGISLATURE MAY TWO YEARS AGO -- SO I ACTUALLYDON'T KNOW HOW IT'S WORKING OUT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW YOU'RE JUST BE A VERY STRONG YEAR IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND A WEAKER YEAR AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN SEVEN THE WISDOM IN HIND SIGHT OF THAT DECISION WILL BE DETERMINED YOU KNOW OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS OVER THE LONGER. TERM -- BUT RIGHT NOW THEY MADE THE COUNTY SHORT TERM COST OF BORROWING FROM THOSE FINES AND THE LONG TERM RETURN RATE ASSUME THAT ABOUT 7% WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY MAKING THAT ONCE AND NOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF PAYING THAT BACK OVER SEVERAL YEARS. HE BEEN -- NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE WITH THE I. CALPERS. THREE BILLION TO CALPERS BUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION TO LOWER THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PAYMENTS. SO IN THE LAST MONTH. WE'VE SEEN LAUSD. DEMAND A 6% PAY INCREASE. WE NOW HAVE OAKLAND UNIFIED THAT WANTS TO CONSIDER GOING ON STRIKE PER PAY INCREASE. AND WE GET SACRAMENTO CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S HAVING. A CASH FLOW PROBLEMS MAY BE OUT OF CASH ON NOVEMBER. SO. WE STEP IN AS A STATE AND SAY OKAY WE'RE GOING TO PREPAY CAL. STIRS AND WILL HELP YOU WITH YOUR PAYMENTS. BUT IF THAT JUST TRANSLATES INTO A PAY RAISE. I'M A PICK ON THE TEACHERS I'M JUST DOING THE MATH HERE IF THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE GONNA. PROVIDE THEM THE THE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM TO GET A RAISE WHICH WHEN YOU GIVE A REYES NOW ADDS TO THE PENSION PROBLEM BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE GONNA. HAVE TO FUND FOR A HIGHER SALARY -- HOW DO WE? HOW WE PUT A PROVISO ON ON YOUR SMART MOVE? TO PREPAY AND REDUCE FUTURE COSTS WHEN ALLWE'RE DOING IS SHIFTING IT TO A NEW. POTENTIAL COST I'M. RETURNING I'M JUST SAYING THIS BASED ON WHAT WE'RE WATCHING YOU KNOW. HAPPENING IN THE IN THE STATE WITH SOME OF OUR BIGGEST. SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT ALSO SOME OF OUR IN MOST FISCAL CRISIS SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO YES ALL MAKE TWO POINTS ON THAT THE FIRST IS THE VERY BROAD POINT IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S INTENT -- THIS WAS AWAY BECAUSE WE KNOW A LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS INCLUDING VERY LARGE DISTRICTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE COSTS WITH THESE RISING FIXED COSTS THAT THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY DISCRETION OVER SO. THIS WAS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL BREATHING ROOM -- AND I THINK IN THE CASE OF LAUSD OVER THREE HUNDRED FROM THE TOP THAT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NOT MILLION DOLLAR MARKET WE ARE ESTIMATING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. OUT WITHOUT RAISING THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT BASE WHICH WE KNOW IN AN EMERGENCY YOU KNOW THAT COULD COMPOUND THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND INCLUDING THAT. CAL WORK SINCE EIGHTEEN EVERITT IS TAKING A RESERVE IN MEDI CAL WE WANT BUT ON THE MORE SPECIFIC POINT THAT YOU RAISE THE WAY THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS AND MISTER LAMBERT CAN WAY AND ALSO IS. THIS IS TO HELP -- ADDRESS THE SCHOOLS AND THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR CAL STIRS BY GIVING THEM SOME RELIEF BUT IN TERMS OF THE ADDITIONAL RACES AND YOU KNOW IF IF IF TEACHERS GOT ADDITIONAL RAISES ARE. COSTS GOING FORWARD I BELIEVE AND MISTER LAMBERT CAN CORRECT ME I BELIEVE FOR EMPLOYEES GOING FORWARD FOR TEACHERS -- THESE RATES ARE SET IN STATUTE BUT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO FLUCTUATE BASED ON NORMAL COST -- SO IF YOU TAKE TE ASSUMPTION FOR TEACHERS GOING FORWARD AND GO AND THIS IS FOR NEW TEACHERS AT FACE VALUE DAN -- IF THAT 7% INVESTMENT RETURN RATE IS TO DECLINE AND THE CALPERS CASTERS BORDER TO MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT WE SHOULD ASSUME LESS THAN 7%. THEN THE CONTRIBUTION RATE OF TEACHERS WOULD ACTUALLY GO UP -- I SHOULD CLARIFY THAT I BELIEVE THIS APPLIES TO NEWER EMPLOYEES SCENE OF WHICH I AM ONE OF MYSELF YOU KNOW FOR STATE EMPLOYEE. FROM PLEASE PLACE AFTER TWENTY THIRTEEN WHERE IT CAN FLUCTUATE BASED ON NORMAL COST FOR THOSE PRECEDING EMPLOYEES IT WOULD BE BASED ON BARGAINING SO THERE'S NO SIMPLE ANSWER TO THAT. POINT YOU RAISE IT'S A MIX OF TWO DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS NOW I JUST DON'T WANT THE WISDOM OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S TRYING TO DO ALL OF A SUDDEN. BE. OFFSET BY OTHER AGENDAS WHICH I APPRECIATE BECAUSE I HAVE A BROTHER WHO'S A SCHOOL TEACHER SO I I GET ALL THIS -- BUT WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. RAINY DAY. FOR AND SO I'M WONDERING IF THE GOVERNOR. CONSIDERING SOME OF THE THAT THE PLIGHTS OF SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHETHER WE SHOULD BE MAKING A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO THAT FUND. AHEAD OF THE FORMULA TO BE PREPARED FOR WHAT ROOM BECAUSE OF LA UNIFIED COMES KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR. THEY NEED TEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM. I KNOW THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION SO I WILL SAY YOU KNOW HERE WE WANTED TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS INTO THAT. PENSION FUND BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT THE SAVINGS WILL COMPOUND OVER TIME AS SOME THE GENTLEMEN WERE MENTIONING THE OTHER THING I THINK IS WORTH NOTING IT'S NOT A SOLUTION BUT SOME THE SCHOOLS TO HAVE. RESERVE AMPLE RESERVES FOR A WEEK THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS THE ISSUE THAT WE ARE ALL DEALING WITH IS YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT LOOKING JUST FOR THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR EVEN THE YEAR AFTER WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM. AND SO THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MANAGER -- THANKS FOR THE THIRD DISCUSSION HERE. BY THE I WANTED TO GET A LITTLE DRILL DOWN A LITTLE MORE ON THE PROJECTION OF SCENARIOS FOR DOWN TICKS AND WHAT THEY MAY LOOK LIKE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT IS. SOMEWHAT OF A ROUGH SCIENCE IF NOT AN ART BUT YOU KNOW I WE WE SORT OF WE CENTRAL GAP GOING FOR I'M LOOKING HERE. WHERE? THIRTEEN EIGHTY ON THE RAINY DAY FUND SO YOU KNOW. SOMEWHERE AROUND ALMOST A THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR GAP -- HI I AGE I DID WILL APPLY J. PRECIADO THE PROP TO INTERPRETATION AND I KNOW WE'VE GOT HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN THE STATE BUT I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW THE VOTERS WHEN THEY SPOKE ABOUT THE RAINY DAY FUND THEY THEY DID WANT THAT DURABILITY IN OUR BUDGETS GOING FORWARD SO. I DO APPRECIATE THAT BUT WHAT WHY DO YOU THINK IT WILL ONLY BE LIKE THE NINETIES AND NOT WORSE LIKE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE DRIVING THAT SORT OF JUST GENERAL BALL PARKING THINKING. THAT SO IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT YOU KNOW TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY MODELING AND WE'RE NOT PROJECTING IT BUT WE WANT TO RUN SCENARIO SOMEWHERE TO THE CENTERS FOR THE PENSION UNDS. IS THAT IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE NINETEEN NINETIES -- BUT BETTER THAN THE GREAT RECESSION AND WHAT'S ALL CERTAINLY HOPE IT'S WHATEVER COMES IS BETTER THAN THE GREAT RECESSION -- SO WE JUST LOOKED AT THAT AS A MODERATE AND I KNOW LAOF SPOKE ABOUT MILES RECESSION IN MODERATE RECESSION WE JUST WANTED TO MODEL WHAT A MODERATE RECESSION WOULD LOOK LIKE AND THAT'S WHERE OUR ECONOMICS IN REVENUE UNIT CAME UP WITH THOSE NUMBERS. AND AND SO. IN THAT MODERNIZATION MATER RECESSION SCENARIO THOUGH WE STILL FACING A BIG GAP IN SAID THAT CONSTITUTIONAL CAP REGARDLESS HOW YOU INTERPRET. PROP TWO WE'RE STILL GONNA. HAVE TO FILL IT SOME WAY AND THAT IS CORRECT THAT'S GOING TO BE OUT OF HIS CUT ISN'T EVEN IF THIS MODERATE RECESSION WE'RE THAT ONLY HAPPENED IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS. THE RAINY DAY FUND BY THAT POINT WOULD BE ALMOST TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS A HUGE NUMBER BUT AS YOU NOTED SMALLER THAN THE NUMBERS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT -- THANK YOU FOR THAT -- WHAT -- WANTED TO ALSO LOOK AT THE THE ASSUMPTIONS SORT OF HISTORICALLY HOW THEY'VE MATCHED UP SO I KNOW WE WE WENT FROM SEVEN POINT FIVE DOWN TO SEVEN THAT ADJUSTMENT. THINK IT CASTERS AND AND CALPERS. SO. HISTORICALLY WHAT HAVE WE BEEN ACHIEVING. SORT OF HOW HOW HOW DO YOU HOW HOW DID WHAT IT WHAT IS YOUR THINKING BEHIND THOSE SORT OF ADJUSTMENTS AND ARE WE TOO HIGH TO LOW POTENTIALLY HERE -- YEAH HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT THAT THOUGHT THE FIRST HOUSES SOMETIME IT'S HARD TO JUST LOOK AT THE PAST BECAUSE IT'S LAKE OUR BOARD AT ALL. ALL RETIREMENT SYSTEMS WOULD BE DO NORMALLY ON A ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO VOTE CALLOUSED CALVET CULTURES AND CALPERS EVERY FOUR YEARS THE BOARD WILL LOOK AT HOW THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED TO TRY TO DETERMINE IF IT'S THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO INVEST THE ASSETS GOING FORWARD AND IF. YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY. THE ASSET ALLOCATION A HOW THE ASSETS HAVE BEEN INVESTED HAS CHANGED QUITE A BIT AT LEAST FOR US IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY WE HAVE OUR OWN MORE THAN 7% HISTORY. HISTORICALLY BUT WHAT MATTERS MOST SOME FOR US WE ARE ABOUT TO START THIS CYCLE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT OUR ASSET ALLOCATION IS. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AS TO AS TO WHERE YOU ARE TODAY OW THE MARKETS AND WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK GOING FORWARD SO. THE LAST TIME WE DID IT. WE HARD INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS WE HAVE OUR OWN INTERNAL STAFF EVERYONE SAID 7% IS WHERE YOU SHOULD BE LONG TERM. BUT WE STILL BELIEVE THIS IS CORRECT -- WE ARE GONNA GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AGAIN THIS YEAR TO ROOM VALID ID TO SEE IF WE CAN VALIDATE THIS AGAIN BUT THIS IS A AN ONGOING QUESTION THAT. RETIREMENT SYSTEM HAVE TO ANSWER YOU KNOW CAN I STILL ASSUME 7% OF WHATEVER YOU'RE SOON GOING LONG TERM. THAT IT IS REALLY A SOMETIME IT'S HARD TO COMPARE ONE TION OF HOW YOU DECIDE TO INVEST YOUR ASSETS LIKE IF AS AN INDIVIDUAL YOU LOOK AT YOUR FOUR ONE K.. AND YOU SAY I'M GONNA PUT EVERYTHING IN AND GOVERNMENT BONDS I THINK IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO ASSUME YOU'RE GOING TO EARN 7%. RIGHT NOW THE THERE'S THEY'RE GIVING YOU 12% SO IT'S A DIRECT RELATION HOW YOU DECIDE TO INVEST THE ASSETS SO YOU KNOW IF. THIS WAS SOME TIME WHEN YOU COMPARE ONE SYSTEM TODAY. TO TO TO ANOTHER ONE IF YOU SEE ONE WITH A MUCH LOWER THAN. EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN THERE MIGHT BE A GOOD REASON BEHIND IT YOU MAY FIND OUT THAT THEY MADE A DECISION TO PUT MORE IN FIXING COMMON BONDS SO. TO FOR US WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH OR 7% AND WE ARE GOING THROUGH THIS REVIEW AGAIN ONE MORE TIME -- SIMILAR COMMENTS TO A MISTER LAMB ROLE -- THREE FOUR YEARS -- CALPERS -- REVIEWS THEIR ASSET ALLOCATION WE LOOK AT THE WILL CALL THE CMA'S CAPITAL MARKET ASSUMPTIONS BOTH -- FOR WITH INTERNAL STAFF AS WELL AS OUTSIDE INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS AND WE MAKE A DETERMINATION ON OUR OUR EXPECTATIONS -- THAT'S BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION OF THE ASSET ALLOCATION AND AS WELL AS LIKE THE RISK THAT THE THE BOARD ONCE TAKEN THE SYSTEM -- IT'LL EVERYTHING IN VERY HIGH RISKY ASSETS TARGET YOUR RETURN BECAUSE SOMETIMES THOSE RETURNED STONE OCCUR AND THEN THOSE LOSSES HAVE TO BE MADE UP BY ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS. THAT CAUSES EXTREME VOLATILITY -- SO IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCE BETWEEN WANTING THEM ALL LEVEL CONTRIBUTIONS BUT TRYING TO GET THAT THE HIGHEST RATED RETURN RIGHT -- WE'VE JUST TIRED AND YOU CHAU HIS NAME SPENDING -- I THINK YOU'LL BE HERE TALKING TO THE RETIREMENT COMMITTEE JOINT COMMITTEE NEXT WEEK AND WILL GIVE SOME INSIGHTS BUT HIS GOAL IN FOCUS AS HE'LL EXPLAIN IS TRYING TO THAT 7% BUT HE'LL TELL YOU STRAIGHT OUT. THAT 7% RETURN IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXPECTED RETURNS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. WHAT I'M GETTING AT IT'S MEAN IT'S GOOD IT'S GONNA BE WHICH IF YOU OVERSHOOT AND WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU? IF FOURTH WE OVERSEEING THE SEVEN AND WE AND WE ONLY END UP AT FIVE THE WILL LOSSES OCCURRED YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. YOUR RATES WOULD SLOWLY CREEP UP AND AT SOME POINT WE WOULD HAVE TO WOULD MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT DISCOUNT RATE BECAUSE IT. IT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AT THOSE RETURNS REALLY REALISTICALLY CAN OCCUR AND AND WE DON'T. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE -- HILL KIND LIKE A MISSED ALLOCATION OF FUNDS YOU'RE PUSHING OFF THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FUTURE GENERATIONS AS OPPOSED TO ACTUALLY MAKING -- THE COST PAYABLE TO BY THE TAXPAYERS RIGHT. THANKS I LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING AS YOU GUYS GO THROUGH YOUR YOUR FOUR YEAR PROCESS MY VERY LAST QUESTION AND THANK YOU FOR THE THE TIME MADAM CHAIR -- I KNOW. WHAT I'M A BUDGET RESILIENCE TODAY I BROUGHT IT UP IF FEW HEARINGS IN THE PAST ABOUT -- ONE OF OUR ON GOING WHAT I CONSIDER ALSO A LIABILITY WHICH IS -- THE EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS THAT SEEM TO BE COMING UP YEAR AFTER YEAR AND IN FACT -- PENSION FUNDS ARE DEEPLY INVESTED IN THE UTILITY SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA -- IN P. JEANNIE AS WELL AS OUR OTHER INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES -- LOOKING AT THAT. THAT ISSUE NOT SO MUCH AS SAY AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMMER AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE BUT BUT REALLY TRYING TO GET OUR HEADS AROUND WHAT THE ON GOING. COSTS COULD BE TO THE STATE ON A MULTI YEAR BASIS FROM THE SERVER WILD FIRE EMERGENCY SECTOR. I SAW THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE ARE MOVING MORE INTO THE BSA SAY THAN SAY THE SFE YOU FROM LAST YEAR. BUT I REALLY I'M EXCITED THAT WE I THINK WE JUST RE AUTHORIZED HERE THROUGH THE VOTE TODAY INC RE AUTHORIZATION OF OF THAT -- OF THE DISASTER SAID DISASTER. THAT. ARE DIZZY OVER ITS YES YES FOR THAT HAVE YOU GIVEN FURTHER THOUGHT TO TO THAT ISSUE SORT OF ODD. TO HOW. TO ACCURATELY -- EVEN IF NOT PROJECT AT LEAST MODEL -- WHAT THAT RISK COULD LOOK LIKE FOR US GOING FORWARD WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO HAVE A SORT OF STABILITY OR AT LEAST ANTICIPATING RISKS ON A MULTI YEAR BASIS ON THE DISASTER SIDE OF THINGS AND HOW TO SORT OF? NOT GET BLIND SIDED -- I MEAN I'D YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO THE ALEJO'S ANALYSIS WE DID FLOW. TO THINK AND ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS SOMETHING THAT THE ELEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR D. W. R. BOND WHEN WHEN WE HAD. TO LIKE TRICITY CRISIS AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN ENERGY CRISIS I ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S A RESTRUCTURING OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY TO GET THINGS HEALTHY AND STABLE BUT JUST FURTHER THOUGHTS ON THAT SINCE OUR LAST HEARINGS. YES SIR THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY AT FINANCE WHERE WE YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T MODELED. THE SERIOUS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO CLIMATE BUT ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION IS A PRIORITY SO COUPLETHINGS I WANT TO MENTION FIRST YOU KNOW AT FINANCE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A HEALTHY ASSET TO YOU. NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARSBECAUSE WE KNOW THESE THINGS AT SOME POINT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN HOPEFULLY NOT WITH THIS LEVEL SEVERITY BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN PUT AN END TO RIGHT NOW IS THROUGH THE VOTE. NINE IN ALMOST ALL THE WERE HERE LAST ESTABLISH THIS COMMISSION REPORT TO I THINK IT'S ON JULY FIRST ON WHAT HESE COSTS ARE AND YOU FROM THE MOST RECENT FIRES AND WHAT STRUCTURES WE CAN UNDERTAKE TO MITIGATE THEM -- AND AS YOU SAW BOTH OF THE APPOINTEES FROM THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE INCLUDING THE FORMER. INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DAVE JONES THESE ARE PRETTY HIGH LEVEL APPOINTEES THAT WE HAVE ON THIS COMMISSION SO I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HELP ALL OF US -- MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS. AND THEN THE LAST THING I KNOW I MENTIONED HER NAME LAST TIME BRIEFLY BUT KATE CORD AND SHE HADN'T COME INTO OFFICE YET BUT SHE'S OUR NEW OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH AND DIRECTOR. AND SHE HAS A LONG BACKGROUND WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE SUSTAINABILITY BUT ALSO ON THE SPECIFIC PINT YOU MENTION QUANTIFYING THOSE RISKS SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS A PLAN IN PLACE TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW pABOUT THE PEOPLE AND PERSONNEL INVOLVED. THERE'S A LOT OF EXPERTISE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU THIRD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU AND TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING AND CONTINUE TO DO. TO MAKE SURE PENSION FUNDS ARE WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND SO THE FOLKS THAT WE'VE MADE PROMISES TO WE CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER ON THOSE PROMISES. I HAD A QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER LAMB MORALE THEY SAY THAT EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE HE DID THE THING OKAY THANK YOU. SO A CAL STIR STIRS WILL BE FULLY FUNDED AND TWENTY FORTY SIX CORRECT THAT IS THE GOAL OF THAT'S THE GOAL AND WE HAVE A PLAN. SO I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT BECAUSE WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE MISS THE POINT AND THE FACT THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PLAN. TO GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE SO I HOPE THAT PLAN AND THAT WE'RE GOING WE'RE WORKING HARD TO GET TO FULLY FUNDED AND NOT JUST TALK ABOUT UNFUNDED LIABILITIES BECAUSE I THINK UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. ARE JUST A FACT WHEN IT COMES TO RETIREMENT SYSTEMS AND PENSION PLANS. AND I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT -- CALPERS THEIR FIFTY SEVEN BILLION AND UNFUNDED LIABILITIES THAT'S CORRECT. AND ARE THEY ALSO ON TRACK TO BE FULLY FUNDED AND TWENTY FORTY SIX YEAH ACTUALLY PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT FOR THE RIVER. AMORTIZATION POLICY THAT THAT SORT OF ALLOCATES ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS SO WE HAVE SOME BASIS THAT HAVE BEEN ON AND ARE BEING PAID OFF. TEN TWELVE YEARS HAVE LEFT THAT'S GREAT AND THEN THE MORE RECENT ONES ARE THE LIKE A THIRTY YEAR BASE WHICH HAS THIRTY YEARS REMAINING. ARM WE'VE JUST CHANGE OUR POLICY IN FACT WE'RE GOING TO TWENTY YEARS. MAXIMUM PERIOD STARTING WITH THE NEXT ALLEY WHICH THE COMES UP. SO WE ARE MOST THOSE BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS WE PAID OFF WITHIN THIRTY YEARS FANTASTIC DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING WHAT IS THE ONLY ONE COMMENT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS BECAUSE SOMETIME WE HAVE EVEN FOR US WE HAVE A LOT OF MEMBERS. THAT WILL CALL US AND BE WORRIED BECAUSE THEY SEE WERE 63% FUNDED IN THE MAIN MESSAGE WE HAVE FOR EVERYONE WE REPEAT IT TWO OR BOARD ALL THE TIME. IT'S DONE THIS IS SILLY WHERE YOU ARE THAT SHOULD BE ALARMING IS OR YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING TO WHERE YOU'RE HEADING THAT'S RIGHT IF YOU LOOKED IS BACK. LAKE TEN YEARS AGO FOR US WE WERE ABOUT 80% FUNDED AT CAL STIRS. BUT WE WERE ON THE WAY DOWN BECAUSE WE CHIU IN PLACE TODAY ALL THE WITH 63% FUNDED WERE HEADING UP AND THAT'S THE KEY pYOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE FOCUSING ON WHAT'S THE DESTINATION. AND RIGHT NOW A DESTINATION IS ALL POURED WHICH IS. IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD AND BE FOCUSING ON YES I AGREE A AND IF WE CAN JUST CONTINUE TO GET THAT MESSAGE OUT THERE BECAUSE I THINK SO MANY TIMES IT'S JUST TWO MEN GLOOM AND EVERYTHING IS HORRIBLE. AND THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT WE ARE ON AN UPWARD TRACK SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THE WHITE HOUSE. ONE QUESTION -- MR THIS ONE UP ON CALPERS AND CAL STIRS OUR SHAREHOLDERS IN THE P. JEANNIE REORGANIZATION ONE THE CARDINAL RULES IN BANKRUPTCY IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR CLAIM IT'S A 100%. THOUGH SHAREHOLDERS GET WIPED OUT. CAN YOU QUANTIFY THAT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR RISK WHAT WE MAY TWO BECAUSE TYPICALLY IN A REORGANIZATION THE DEBTOR OFFERS THOSE WIPED OUT SHAREHOLDERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE NEW SHARES AT SOME. DISCOUNTED RATE. GOING LOOKING FORWARD. SO YES SO -- I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW IN EVERY BANKRUPTCY THE OUT. OFTEN SHAREHOLDERS TO GET WIPED OUT -- BUT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK TO THE MOST RECENT P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY AND THE OUTCOMES WERE MUCH MILDER FOR A LOT OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THERE. SO THE ONLY ANSWER I HAVE IS NUMBER ONE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BUT NUMBER -- TWO THE PACKAGE THAT YOU JUST STARTED ON WHICH INCLUDES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION WILL MAKE SURE THAT WHEN IT COMES NOT JUST TO THE STATE ITSELF BUT TO CALPERS AND CAL STIRS WITCHER OUR RETIREES. INTERESTS AS WELL [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR YOUR INDULGENCE I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION FOR CAL STIRS AND AND EIGHTY BEFORE AGAIN THAT SCAN WHAT THANK THE MINISTRATION FOR ACTUALLY HELPING OUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT PUTTING SOME FUNDS -- AT THAT. SINCE YOU PROJECTED HALF PERCENT I MEAN IT'S A LOT. OF MOVING FORWARD -- ON ON GOING BASIS BUT I KNOW SOME CONCERN WAS RAISED WELL GEE YOU KNOW THE TEACHERS SWEET HELP OUT. THE ONLY ABOUT THE STIRRED RECOMMENDATION THEY'RE JUST GOING TO NOW ASK FOR MORE SALARY BUT I'D. THAN DO I KNOW YOU'RE THE ACTUARIES BUT I GO SHEETS AND IMPOSE MADE REFERENCE TO MY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SOME OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND -- THAT IS PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS SUCH AS THE SALARY THAT THAT COMMENSURATE ENTRIES IN. TENSION THAT MIGHT RESULT IN INCREASED SALARY ACTUALLY IS BUILT IN TO THE SALARY INTO THAT NEGOTIATION INCLUDING THEIR CONTRIBUTION BY PERCENTAGE. TWO THOUSAND HOURS IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING. YES VS AND UX ON THIS POINT I JUST WANT TO GO BACK -- BUT TO MISTER MOORE LOCKS A QUESTION OR COMMENT EARLIER SO -- IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE A FUNDING PLAN IN PLACE BUT CONTRIBUTION RATES THAT ARE FIXED FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THROUGH FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND RIGHT NOW SCHEDULED TO GO UP TO NINETEEN POINT 1%. BEYOND THAT POINT OR BOARD WILL THEN HAVE AUTHORITY TO ADJUST THE CONTRIBUTION RTE FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE HAVE LIMITS FOR THE I I DID MENTION IT EARLIER BUT OUR BOARD WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. UPWARD OR DOWNWARD BY NO MORE THAN 1% IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. AND IN THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION WE PROVIDED OR BOARD LAST YEAR WAS AT THIS TIME WE EXPECT TO HAVE TO DECREASE. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S CONTRIBUTION TO SOMEWHERE AROUND SO IT CREATES AN INTERESTING SITUATION FUNDING FROM THE STATE SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL BE ASKED TO START CONTRIBUTING EIGHTEEN POINT 1% NEXT YEAR. NINETEEN POINT 1% THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND IT POTENTIALLY OR BOARD WOULDN'T TURN AROUND A YEAR LATER AND WOULD USE IT AGAIN -- I'M NOT A BUDGET PERSON I'VE OF I USED TO WORK AT CALPERS BEFORE AND I REMEMBER SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT EMPLOYERS USE TO TELL US WHICH IS I WOULD RATHER HAVE A STABLE CONTRIBUTION RATE. THAN HAVE WANTED INCREASES AND SUDDENLY DECREASES SO I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL -- IT I SORT OF A TRADE OFF AND GIVING SHORT TERM RELIEF TO EMPLOYERS AND LONG TERM RELIEF AS WELL. I PLEASE MYSELF IF I MADE A BUDGET PERSON AND I'M LOOKING AT WHAT IT MIGHT DO IT'S LOOKING IN ALL ITS WORST IT SEEMS THAT IT WILL PROVIDE. MORE OF A STABLE. IF YOU WANT PATH FOR THE CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT TO CAL STIRS WERE POTENTIALLY IT WILL INCREASE 18% AND STAY AROUND THAT LEVEL SO. THAT'S PROBABLY ANNOYS YOU CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL THIS THIS COULD BE VIEWED AS ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES. BUDGET STABILITY -- FOR EMPLOYERS. I'M. HAVING BEEN ON A PRIVATE SECTOR PENSION PLAN OF ONE OF HE THINGS THAT ALWAYS IMPACTED THE PLAN WITH THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS. AND THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS. SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. UP VERSION OF THE PLAN. WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT HAS BEEN HAS THERE BEEN AN IMPACT IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS A NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS? AND IN PARTICULAR WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS -- COULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT IS THAT AN ISSUE HASN'T BEEN. OR COULD YOU SEE I I CAN ELABORATE ON THIS SO AGAIN I THINK THE ANSWER MAY BE DIFFERENT BETWEEN CAL STIRS AND CALPERS -- SO FOR US EVERY YEAR FOR THE LAST. FOR PRESENTING TOUR ABOARD A REPORT THAT WE CALL THE REVIEW OF CAL STORMS FUNDING LEVELS AND RISK WE WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FOCUS AND MAKE OUR BOARD AWARE OF WHERE WHAT ARE SORT OF THE MAIN RISKS. THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE IS A SYSTEM THAT COULD PREVENT US FROM REACHING FULL FUNDING AND YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT BECAUSE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON THREE MAIN RISKS. FIRST ONE BEING INVESTMENT RISK I THINK EVERYONE IS AWARE OF THE FLUCTUATION INVESTMENT MARKETS. THE SECOND ONE BEING A HOW LONG OUR MEMBERS LIVE AND IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN RECENT NEWS REPORTS WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THIS AT CAL STIRS BUT THE THE EXPRESSION THAT TEACHERS LIVE FOREVER. HAS MORE AND MORE TRUTH TO IT. TAKE EACH MONTH OR BOARD MEMBER OR ARE CHAIR OF THE IN A DILLON SENDS BIRTHDAY CARDS TO OUR BOARD MEMBERS WHO TURNED ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD TO OUR MEMBERS. AND SHE'S BEEN SIGNING CLOSE TO THIRTY OF THESE LETTERS EACH MONTH. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA WE HAVE APPROACHING FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY A HUNDRED YEARS OLD A MORE. AND THE THIRD RISK THAT WE PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION -- GOING BACK TO THE QUESTION IS THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS IN OUR SYSTEM. IT AGAIN IT ALL GOES BACK TO REASON WE BRING THAT UP FOUR AND THEN AGAIN IT'S JUST SPECIFIC TO OUR SITUATION. BECAUSE OUR BOARD HAS LIMITED AUTHORITY TO ADJUST CONTRIBUTION RATE. AND ONE OF THE BIG FACTOR IS OF CONTRIBUTING TEACHERS THE PAYROLL OF THE SYSTEM IF YOU WANT TO TO THE EXTENT WE WERE TO START TO SEE A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA FOR VARIOUS REASONS. IT COULD BE BECAUSE WE HAVE LESS CHILDREN IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF BUDGET PRESSURE WHAT WE HAVE TO REDUCE CLASS SIZES. OR FOR US WE TRY TO KEEP AN EYE ON COMMITTEE COLLEGES WHICH ARE PART OF CAL STIRS BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW. THE WE WOULD DELIVER IT EDUCATION MAY CHANGE DOWN THE ROAD OF WITH ONLINE LEARNING THERE MAYBE A NEED FOR LESS TEACHERS IN THE FUTURE SO THOSE ARE KIND OF WE'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THESE RISK AND FOR US. BECAUSE WE HAVE RATE SETTING WE HAVE LIMIATION ON HOW WE CAN SET THE RATES IT BECOMES A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE EQUATION. HAS IT BEEN SO. YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION. TO FOR US IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS THE NUMBERS HAVE GROWN ACT IF YOU GO BACK A DECADE -- IT IT IT KIND OF DIPLO ABOUT A DECADE AGO BUT SINCE FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN A CONSTANT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA AND SO OUR MEMBERSHIP HAS BEEN GROWING -- BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT PROJECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ISSUES ABOUT PROJECTION OF FOR STUDENTS A K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE. IT'S FAIRLY STABLE OR EVEN EXPECTED TO SLIGHTLY DECLINE SO WE WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT MUCH OF A GROWTH. GOING FORWARD BUT HE HAS BEEN GROWING FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE DRIVER OF WHY WE NOW EXPECT. A SLIGHTLY LOWER CONTRIBUTIONS TO WIN THE CAL STIRS FUNDING PLAN WAS PASSED IS BECAUSE WE HAVE MUCH MORE TEACHERS TODAY IN THE SYSTEMS THAN WE DID BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN IRAQ. I THOUGHT THE THE FOLKS WHO KOW ABOUT THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR SOME TIME ABOUT DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN CASE THROUGH FOURTEEN IN THE STATE. CERTAINLY IN THE OUT YEARS AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. TWENTY FORTY SIX IF THAT'S TRUE DO YOU PLAN FOR IN YOUR PROJECTIONS FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT DECLINE. IN STUDENT ENROLLMENT IN CASE TO FOURTEEN AND AND THE COMMENSURATE. POTENTIAL FOR A REDUCTION IN YOUR PARTICIPATING -- EMPLOYEES. BENEFICIARIES WITH A RECALL. RIGHT NOW BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE WHICH WE WE RELY A LOT ON SOME OF THE INFORMATION DEPARTMENT FINDS HAS ON THEIR WEBSITE THAT IS KIND OF THE PROJECTION OF K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS. WERE IN ALL OF OUR WORK WE ASSUME THAT WE'RE GOING TO DE DE. FROM THE STUDENT POPULATION A NUMBER OF TEACHERS WILL REMAIN CONSTANT OVER TIME IS SORT OF THE WAY WE DO IT BUT TO THE EXTENT WE ALSO PROVIDE THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO OUR BOARD. AND IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE IF WE WHERE TO GET TO SEE A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS THAT WOULD PUT PRESSURE ON CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. PUSHING EVERYTHING UPWARD AT THE SONORA ON OUR SIDE. THANK YOU FOR THE ROTH IN THE FINAL OF QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS BEFORE WE OPEN UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NONE PUBLIC COMMENT. THE MORNING CHURN MEMBERS DEREK CLINICS ON BEHALF OF THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION THE SCHOOL EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. STATE THE OBVIOUS THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR STIRS OBLIGATIONS ON SCHOOL EMPLOYERS I WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT. IN JUST ONE ME TWO QUICK POINTS ON IT TO SPEAK TO SOME OF WHAT THE MEMBERS FOR SAYING. THE FIRST IS BECAUSE WE SUPPORT A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE THE FULL FUNDING PLAN BECAUSE THIS HELPS TO STRENGTHEN THAT PLAN HELP US GET TO A 100%. YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY THREE BILLION DOLLAR SOONER -- WE THINK IT'S A REALLY SMART MOVE BECAUSE OBLIGATED AND COMMITTED TO PAYING THOSE BENEFITS FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. AND THE SECOND THING IS EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HERE TALKING TO ME BUDGET COMMITTEE ABOUT RESERVES DEBTS AND LIABILITIES THIS CONVERSATION COULD EASILY BE HAPPENING IN SUB. ONE OVER TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN OUR VIEW A THREE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TOWARDS PENSINS IT'S A THREE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TOWARDS K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU'RE FREEING UP SO MANY OPERATIONAL RESOURCES. FOR SCHOOLS AT A LOCAL LEVEL SIR THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO FEEL HEARD IN THIS CONVERSATION WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING IT FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND WE THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF YOUR PROPOSED BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I'D LIKE TO ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE -- BY MY COLLEAGUE -- IN APPRECIATE THAT LEADERSHIP THAT THE GOVERNOR AND AND HIS STAFF WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE TAKING ON THIS ISSUE IT IS A TRUE THIS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. ON HELPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR BUDGETS FAX DO MATTER IN DURING THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION OUR SCHOOLS LOST SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT THAT WE NEVER RECEIVED OR NEVER GOING TO RECEIVE. THAT IS THE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE SYSTEMIC A LACK OF FISCAL SUPPORT DURING THAT RECESSION HAS REALLY -- BECOME MORE ABOUT BOILING OVER PORT -- POINT IN A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT -- IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF PENSIONS IT'S BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEMIC UNDER. OF EDUCATION FOR THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE INCREASES IN CAL STIRS RATES BUT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT TALK IN EDUCATION TERMS. SPECIAL EDUCATION HAS BEEN A SICK LACK OF FUNDING YESTERDAY I WAS WITH THE EDUCATORS FROM PARADISE IN SANTA ROSA. AND THE LACK OF ADEQUATE FUNDING IN TRANSPORTATION HAS MEANT THAT THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE RECENT WILDFIRES HAVE HAD TO USE MORE OF THEIR RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY HELP COVER TRANSPORTATION WHICH IS ENCROACHING INTO THEIR BUDGET. SO I DO WANT TO CLARIFY IN NOTE THAT THE STRIKE THAT WE RECENTLY HAD AN LA. THE STRIKE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAPPEN IN OAKLAND THE VERY COURAGEOUS CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN SACRAMENTO CITY ARE NOT BECAUSE OF PENSIONS BETTER BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SYSTEMIC SUPPORT. FOR EDUCATION AND WE DON'T THINK THAT IT'S A CRIME FOR EDUCATORS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SALARY TO ALLOW THEM TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY SERVE. AND EVEN IF THEY GET THOSE INCREASES THAT WOULD STILL NOT ONLY NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WITH THEIR TRULY ASKING FOR SYSTEMIC SUPPORT IN THE CLASSROOM. SO THAT DISTRICTS CAN OFFER THE SUPPORT IN THE CLASSROOM BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL AS WELL AS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES NEEDS ARE HEARD -- AND THEY'RE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ENCROACHMENT OF THE COST OF INCREASING OF CHARTER SCHOOLS ALSO DOESN'T INHIBIT THE DISTRICT'S ABILITY TO SERVE THE STUDENTS AND WHAT THEY NEED SO. BY SUPPORTING INTO THREE HUNDRED OUT THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN CAL STIRS WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS GIVING OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS MORE SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE ALL STUDENTS CAN GET SERVE HOLISTICALLY AND WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP FOR THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WOULD LIKE TO OUR THANK MISS HOLLINSHEAD GENTLEMAN FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN TODAY'S HEARING VERY HELPFUL GAVE US ALL AN OPPORTUNITY. TO DIG A LITTLE DEEPER AND GET OUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND THE THE DIALOGUE WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH HEARING IS ADJOURNED
