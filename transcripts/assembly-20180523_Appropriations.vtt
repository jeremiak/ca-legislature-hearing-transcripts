00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:07.352 region:rollup2
EQUIPPED TO HANDLE. AND OFTEN

00:33:05.484 --> 00:33:09.354 region:rollup2
SWELL OF COUPLES HOLE. THIS IS

GET TO WATCH GROW UP.

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:19.898 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH

00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:22.634 region:rollup2
UNEXPECTED EXPENSES THAT ADD

00:33:19.898 --> 00:33:24.436 region:rollup2

SOME CASES IN SOME COUPLES NEED

00:33:31.343 --> 00:33:33.879 region:rollup2

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:24.141 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:26.577 region:rollup2

PERIOD. AND IT WOULD SAVE MONEY

00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:21.432 region:rollup2
IF THE.

00:48:20.498 --> 00:48:22.566 region:rollup2

.

00:48:40.217 --> 00:48:42.586 region:rollup2
THE THE ISSUE IS WHETHER THE

00:48:41.185 --> 00:48:43.454 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SHOULD EXERCISE

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:45.322 region:rollup2

TOGETHER.

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:23.454 region:rollup2
SEVERAL LARA RECOGNIZES THAT.

00:50:21.986 --> 00:50:25.256 region:rollup2
THERE IS A LEGAL PROBLEM HERE

00:50:23.454 --> 00:50:27.391 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

00:50:25.256 --> 00:50:29.159 region:rollup2
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:30.461 region:rollup2
BILL ON SEVERAL LARA SPILL. IS

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:31.762 region:rollup2

BUT.

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:43.674 region:rollup2
ITS ACT WHETHER IT'S A SARAH

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:45.242 region:rollup2
LAWRENCE VERSION OR MY VERSION

00:50:43.674 --> 00:50:47.311 region:rollup2
THERE IS STILL A CHECK IF THE

00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:48.746 region:rollup2
ONLY QUESTION IS AT WHAT POINT

00:50:47.311 --> 00:50:50.447 region:rollup2
DOES JAIL LIKE CHECKING.

00:50:48.746 --> 00:50:52.049 region:rollup2
BUT I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:53.717 region:rollup2
WORK IT OUT THIS IS ORIGINALLY

00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:56.520 region:rollup2

TO DROP MY BILL.

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:09.233 region:rollup2
BUT AS THEIR INSTITUTIONAL

00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:10.367 region:rollup2
MATTER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:13.470 region:rollup2
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE.

00:51:10.367 --> 00:51:14.538 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHECK AND.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.105 region:rollup2
