AND EVERYDAY ADULT LIFE.

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:19.605
IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY STUDENTS

00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:20.573
CAN BE OVERLOOKED IN THE LIVES

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:22.007

I BY CAN SUMMARIZE THIS PROPOSAL

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:50.269

STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN THAT IT

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:56.929
LEAVES IT AT THAT.

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:59.064
WHICH ISN'T VERY COMPREHENSIVE

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:00.099
AND I COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS A

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:02.201
SCHOOL HAVING STUDENTS SIGN OFF

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:04.570

I REPRESENT THE OTHER NON BINARY

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.156
STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHEN I

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:32.858
ASK THAT ALL SCHOOLS ARE

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:33.992
REQUIRED TO HAVE A GENDER

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:36.261
NEUTRAL BATHROOM THAT IS EASILY

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.330
ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS.

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:39.832
I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THESE NON

00:16:39.898 --> 00:16:41.100
BINARY STUDENTS TO FEEL

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:42.901
INVALIDATED BY OUR CURRENT LACK

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:43.969
OF GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOM

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.138
FACILITIES.

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.206
SCHOOL SHOULD BE A COMPLETELY

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:48.807
INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:49.908
PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF GENDER

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:52.478
IDENTITY.

00:16:52.544 --> 00:16:53.479
A PLACE WHERE GENDER NEUTRAL

00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:54.780
RESTROOMS ARE JUST AS EASILY

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.548
ACCESSIBLE AS MALE OR FEMALE

00:16:56.615 --> 00:16:58.183
RESTROOMS.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.685
IN MY IDEAL SCHOOL PREFERRED

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:01.653
PRONOUNS IN NAMES ARE NOT ONLY

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.789
RESPECTED BUT ACCOUNTED.

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.023
FOR AND GENDER NON CONFORMING

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.493
USE EEL REPRESENTED REPRESENTED

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:07.993
AND VALUED WITHIN THEIR

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.895
COMMUNITY.

00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:11.730
AS A SOCIETY WE HAVE MADE

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:13.465
TREMENDOUS STRIDES AND ACCEPTING

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.768
NON BINARY GENDER IDENTITIES THE

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:17.302
STATE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY HAVE

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.737
FURTHER THIS PROGRESSION IN

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:20.372
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:22.307
HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL DEVISED

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:23.409
THAT BECAUSE GENDER NON%

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:25.778
CONFORMING USE TO BE HELD BACK

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:27.746
AND FEEL EXCLUDED AND ISOLATED

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:29.648
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.551
SPECIFICALLY IN OUR SCHOOLS. ONE

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:34.119
OF THE BIGGEST ISSUE SURROUNDING

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:36.221
GENDER INCLUSIVITY IS THE

00:17:36.288 --> 00:17:37.923
APPROPRIATE RESTROOM FACILITIES.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.358
AFTER SERVING STUDENTS FROM

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:40.793
AROUND THE STATE AT THIS

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:42.694
CONFERENCE THE MAJORITY OF

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:43.595
STUDENTS EXPRESSED THAT THEIR

00:17:43.662 --> 00:17:44.863
SCHOOL DID NOT HAVE A GENDER

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.299
NEUTRAL RESTROOMS.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:48.567
MOST SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE A GENDER

00:17:48.634 --> 00:17:50.469
NEUTRAL RESTROOM AT ALL.

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:51.837
BUT THOSE WHO DO ARE ONLY

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.839
ACCESSIBLE THROUGH WALKING KEY

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.641
AND OFTEN DESIGNATED TO TEACHERS

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:58.477
AND STAFF.

00:17:58.544 --> 00:17:59.845
STUDENTS MUST GO TO ACCEPT

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:01.380
EXTENSIVE LINKS JUST TO SIMPLY

00:18:01.447 --> 00:18:02.981
USE THE RESTROOM.

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.316
CREATING A BARRIER THAT FURTHER

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:06.084
ISOLATES A GROUP THAT IS ALREADY

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:09.221
SENSITIVE TO SOCIAL EXCLUSION.

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:10.889
WHEN GOING TO SCHOOL OR ANYWHERE

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.157
IN PUBLIC FOR THAT MATTER I TRY

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:13.225
AT ALL COSTS TO AVOID USING THE

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:15.227
RESTROOM?

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:17.029
I DO THIS TO SKIP CONFLICT

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:18.464
THINGS ID IN THE INVALIDATION

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.631
THAT COMES ALONG WITH USING THE

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:21.467
RESTROOM BUT DOES NOT LINE UP

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:24.036
WITH MY GENDER IDENTITY.

00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:25.170
IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO USE

ADDITIONAL COST.

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:12.711
IN THE CASE OF SCHOOLS HAVE

YOUR RESEARCH WE DISCOVERED THAT

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:35.267
THERE IS NO BILL REQUIRING

WE A STUDENTS RECOGNIZE A

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:19.711
CALIFORNIA'S CURRICULUM FAILS TO

00:26:19.778 --> 00:26:20.979
PROVIDE EDUCATION ON SKILLS

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:22.747
ESSENTIAL TO A SUCCESSFUL LIFE

00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:25.050
AFTER HIGH SCHOOL.

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:26.418
IN SHORT NOT RICH AMERICAN HIGH

00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:27.886
SCHOOL OVERLOOKS THE FACT THAT

00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:29.487
STUDENTS NEED INSTRUCTION ON

00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:30.956
CIVIC ENGAGEMENT.

TAX FILING JOB PREPAREDNESS AND

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:35.126
MANY MORE GENERALIZED SKILLS.

00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:36.361
THE LACK OF A STANDARDIZED

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:37.762
CURRICULUM IN A REQUIRED

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:39.331
GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMIC COURSES

00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:41.366
LIKE COVERAGE ON TOPICS LIKE

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:44.235
COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL LITERACY.

00:26:44.302 --> 00:26:45.704
THIS IMAGINABLE BRIDGE

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.772
DETRIMENTAL TO OUR SOCIETY.

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:48.640
WITH THE CURRENT CURRICULUM

00:26:48.707 --> 00:26:50.075
STUDENTS ARE NOT TAUGHT HOW TO

00:26:50.141 --> 00:26:51.743
PREPARE FOR SUCCESSFUL JOB

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.778
INTERVIEW MANAGE THEIR INCOME OR

00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:55.580
NAVIGATE THE AMERICAN TAX SYSTEM.

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:57.315
THIS INFORMATION IS PARAMOUNT

00:26:57.382 --> 00:26:58.283
FOR FUNCTIONING IN THE WORLD

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.884
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL.

00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:01.219
HOW CAN THIS GENERATION

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:02.487
PARTICIPATE IN THIS WORLD WHEN

00:27:02.554 --> 00:27:03.755
THEY'RE NOT PREPARED WITH THESE

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:06.091
FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS?

00:27:06.157 --> 00:27:07.525
AND THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

NATIONAL REPORT CARD CREATED BY

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.261
THE CENTER FOR FINANCIAL

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:12.097
LITERACY OF CHAMPLIN COLLEGE THE

00:27:12.163 --> 00:27:14.766
STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED IN

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.534
F. ONE GRADED ON CRITERIA

00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:18.570
CRITERIA BASED ON SAY EFFORTS TO

00:27:18.636 --> 00:27:19.804
IMPROVE FINANCIAL LITERACY.

00:27:19.871 --> 00:27:21.339
WE BELIEVE THAT THE REASON FOR

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:22.340
THIS FAILING GRADE IS BECAUSE

00:27:22.407 --> 00:27:23.742
CALIFORNIA'S K. THROUGH TWELVE

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:25.543
EDUCATION CURRENTLY DOES NOT

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:27.178
REQUIRE ANY COMPREHENSIVE

00:27:27.245 --> 00:27:30.648
FINANCIAL CURRICULUM. TO BETTER

00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:31.282
UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF THIS

00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:32.851
ISSUE LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOUTH

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:34.953
PASADENA HIGH SCHOOL.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.055
MANY EXTRACURRICULAR CLASSES

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:39.324
REQUIRE JOB SKILLS SUCH AS

00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:40.959
RESUME WRITING.

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:42.060
BETTER SOON TO HAVE BEEN LEARNED

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:43.361
BUT ARE NEVER FORMALLY TAUGHT IN

00:27:43.428 --> 00:27:44.963
ANY COURSE.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.431
THIS FAILURE TO TEACH BASIC LIFE

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:47.799
SKILLS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE IN

00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:48.967
EDUCATION.

00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:50.935
AS A RESULT STUDENTS OFTEN FEEL

00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:52.637
ILL PREPARED TO PUT TO APPLY TO

00:27:52.704 --> 00:27:53.838
ON CAMPUS OPPORTUNITIES

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:57.709
NONETHELESS OFF CAMPUS JOBS.

00:27:57.776 --> 00:27:58.643
HOWEVER SOME SCHOOLS HAVE TAKEN

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.711
IT UPON THEMSELVES TO MEET

00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:01.179
STUDENT CONCERNS ABOUT THE

00:28:01.246 --> 00:28:02.480
UNCERTAINTY THEY FACE IN LIFE

00:28:02.547 --> 00:28:05.283
BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. FOR EXAMPLE

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.117
AT ENTERPRISE HIGH SCHOOL IN

00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:07.619
REDDING TEACHERS HAVE CHOSEN TO

00:28:07.685 --> 00:28:08.853
TEACH LE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.822
FEEL THAT IT IS A NECESSARY PART

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:12.424
OF EDUCATION.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.658
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE A

00:28:13.725 --> 00:28:14.959
TEACHER WHEN IS THE NEED FOR

00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:16.294
STUDENTS TO LEARN HOW TO WRITE A

00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:17.862
RESUME AND PREPARE FOR AN

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:18.897
INTERVIEW.

00:28:18.963 --> 00:28:19.597
RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:23.168
THESE DANCE VOLUNTARILY TEACH

00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:24.369
THESE THINGS AND THE TIME

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:25.804
FOLLOWING AN A. P. EXAM.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.672
THIS NEED IS NOT JUST RECOGNIZE

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:29.441
BY ADULTS.

00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:30.608
BUT STUDENTS ARE CONSTANTLY

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:31.876
LOOKING TOWARDS OUR FUTURE

00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:34.546
RESPONSIBILITIES ANALYZE AS WELL.

00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:36.147
ADDITIONAL IN A CREDO HIGH

00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:38.016
SCHOOL IN ROHNERT PARK AN ADULT

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:39.451
IN CLASS WAS IMPLEMENTED A

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:41.986
POPULAR REQUESTS FROM STUDENTS.

00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:42.987
STUDENTS WRENCHED EXTREMELY

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:44.622
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE ELECTIVE

00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:45.957
CLASS.

00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:47.092
EVEN THOUGH HIS EFFORTS WERE

00:28:47.158 --> 00:28:48.793
VERY WELL RECEIVED BY STUDENTS

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.195
THERE'S BEEN LITTLE EXPANSION OF

00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:51.129
THESE TEACHING METHODS AT THE

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:53.198
STATE LEVEL.

00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:55.033
ULTIMATELY WE'RE DRIVING OUR

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.868
GENERATION TO ACHIEVE HIGH TEST

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:58.603
SCORES AND PROCEDURES COLLEGE

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.271
ACCEPTANCES AND I FELL TO STRESS

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:01.406
THE IMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING THE

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:03.575
NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE TO OVERCOME

00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:05.210
THE HARDSHIPS OF ADULTHOOD.

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:06.344
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:07.645
CALIFORNIA STRIVING TO

00:29:07.712 --> 00:29:09.347
ACADEMICALLY PREPARE STUDENTS

00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:10.949
pFOR COLLEGE BUT WE CANNOT FOR

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:12.717
AFFORD TO FORGET TO PREPARE THEM

00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:15.253
FOR TOSSES WILL. TO SPEAK ON MY

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.688
EXPERIENCE I CURRENTLY ATTEND

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:18.356
MARYLAND HIGH SCHOOL WHICH A

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:19.824
COURT IN ANY SHOULD RANKS THIRTY

00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:21.426
THIRD IN COLLEGE PREPAREDNESS OF

00:29:21.493 --> 00:29:23.261
THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:24.529
AND THIRTY FOUR PUBLIC HIGH

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:26.564
SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:27.632
IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:29.567
EVEN ACADEMICALLY RIGOROUS

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:30.635
SCHOOLS LIKE MIRA LOMA ARE

00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:32.270
INADEQUATE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:29:32.337 --> 00:29:33.538
OF A LIFE SKILLS PREVIOUSLY

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:35.707
ADDRESSED.

00:29:35.773 --> 00:29:36.674
I MENTION THIS ONLY TO

00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:38.042
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COLLEGE IS

00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:40.245
SIMPLY ONE OF THE MANY ASPECTS

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:41.813
OF THE ADULT WORLD STUDENTS FACE

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.449
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:46.050
THUS A LIFE SKILLS CURRICULUM

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:47.619
WOULD MEET THE STUDENTS NEEDS OF

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:49.154
COLLEGE PREPARATION AS WELL AS

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.788
THE SKILLS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:52.757
BEYOND COLLEGE.

00:29:52.824 --> 00:29:54.325
WE RECOGNIZE THE JOINT EFFORTS

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:55.560
MADE BY STUDENTS AND THEIR

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:56.861
SCHOOLS TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:59.030
SKILLS AND RIGOR.

00:29:59.097 --> 00:30:00.198
STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF ARE

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:01.933
PERFORMING AT AHIGH ACADEMIC

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.369
LEVEL IN PREPARATION FOR COLLEGE.

00:30:04.435 --> 00:30:06.037
HOWEVER WE ARE LIMITED BY THE

00:30:06.104 --> 00:30:07.605
LACK OF AN ENFORCED AND

00:30:07.672 --> 00:30:09.207
STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM IN AREAS

00:30:09.274 --> 00:30:10.508
OF JOB PREPAREDNESS AND

00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:13.545
FINANCIAL LITERACY.

00:30:13.611 --> 00:30:14.979
SO CONSIDER ASKING OURSELVES.

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:16.848
WHAT GOOD IS EDUCATION IF YOU DO

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:19.784
NOT KNOW HOW TO APPLY IT?

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:21.319
IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:22.620
STATISTICAL CONCERNS IT IS

00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:23.988
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:25.356
NEXT GEN PERSONAL FINANCE

00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:26.591

FINDS ONLY ONE IN.

00:30:29.093 --> 00:30:30.361
SIX HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:32.830
A PERSONAL FINANCE COURSE TO

00:30:32.897 --> 00:30:34.499
GRADUATE.

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:37.335
WHAT IS MORE IS THAT ONE IN

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:38.403
TWENTY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:12.710
HOW TO DO THAT.

00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:14.245
ON THEIR OWN --

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:16.047

KNOW I WAS A TO PAY THAT OFF

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:30.561
THAT INTEREST RATE IS VERY HIGH --

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:31.896
AND YOU CAN LEARN BY KNOWING YOU

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:33.231
AN LEARN BY DOING SOMETIMES

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:34.866
BETTER TO LEARN BY KNOWING.

00:35:34.932 --> 00:35:35.733

CERTAINLY IN YOUR HIGH SCHOOL

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:39.504
EXPERIENCE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS --

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.404
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS I

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:42.139
ACTUALLY SUPPORT THIS BUT I

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:43.341
WOULD SAY TO LOCAL SCHOOL

00:35:43.407 --> 00:35:43.975
DISTRICTS WHO WANT IF THEY CAN

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:44.876
DO IT TODAY.

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:46.310
THEY'RE ALREADY ADDING ON

00:35:46.377 --> 00:35:48.546
GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS AT THE

00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:49.146
LOCAL LEEL AND THEY SHOULD BE

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:50.581
DOING.

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.617
IT IN THIS CASE AS WELL OCT IF

00:35:52.683 --> 00:35:53.951
WE MANDATE IT FROM THE STATE

00:35:54.018 --> 00:35:55.086
LET'S SAY THE STATE SAYS YOU

00:35:55.152 --> 00:35:56.654
HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS YOU HAVE

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:58.022
TO STUDY THIS CURRICULUM.

00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:59.357
WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT'S GONNA BE

00:35:59.423 --> 00:36:00.725
SCORED AS A MANDATE WE'RE GONNA

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:02.360
HAVE TO PAY EVERY SCHOOL

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:06.030
DISTRICT ACROSS THE STATE? TO TO

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:07.298
PROVIDE THAT CLASS RENTS PAVE

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:08.633
THE TEACHER TIME EXCEDRIN GETS

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:10.167
VERY EXPENSIVE IT'S MORE OF A

00:36:10.234 --> 00:36:11.536
BURDEN ON THE GREATER STATE

00:36:11.602 --> 00:36:12.670
BUDGET DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE

00:36:12.737 --> 00:36:14.205
DON'T DO IT WE ARE YOU IT MANY

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:14.939
CASES.

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:17.942
BUT ON A MORE AND IT MORE

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.610
IMMEDIATE. FOR LOOKING AT A WHAT

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:20.678
FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE SHORT

00:36:20.745 --> 00:36:22.280
TERM I THINK THE BEST WAY FOR

00:36:22.346 --> 00:36:24.215
THIS TO BE HANDLED IS FOR SCHOOL

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:25.049
DISTRICTS.

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:26.651
AT THEIR NEXT BOARD MEETING

00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:28.319
ADOPT A POLICY THAT OUR STUDENTS

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:30.655
ARE TO GRADUATE --

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:32.423
A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT THAT

YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:06.924
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE THINKING

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:08.559
ABOUT THESE ISSUES ON BEHALF OF

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:10.194

AGREE THAT FROM THE STATE'S

00:37:14.932 --> 00:37:16.267
LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE WE DO

00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:18.069
NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:19.370
WHAT BECOMES AT AT WHAT'S KNOWN

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:20.771
AS AN UNFUNDED MANDATE --

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:23.007
BUT I DO THINK GOING FORWARD AS

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.375
WE TALK ABOUT --

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:25.943

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:26.978
EDUCATION --

00:37:27.044 --> 00:37:28.479
IN A WAY THAT IS MEANINGFUL AND

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:29.914
ALLOWS US TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:31.515
ALL OF THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS.

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:33.050
THAT THIS IS PROBABLY A COURSE

00:37:33.117 --> 00:37:34.652
WORTHY AS A STANDALONE AYE

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:35.753
NEWMAN AYE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.021
ROOM FOR IT NOW IN THE ECONOMICS

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:38.122
CURRICULUM BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:39.557
THE FULL SPECTRUM.

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:40.424
OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU POINTED

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:42.193
OUT JOB RESUMES ENGAGING WITH

00:37:42.259 --> 00:37:44.028
YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT HOW TO TO

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.463
FILE YOUR TAXES THERE ARE SO

00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:47.598
MANY ASPECTS NOW OF BEING READY

00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:49.066
TO ENGAGE IN ADULT LIFE

00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:50.768
PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WHO GO ON

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:51.902
TO IMMEDIATELY PURSUE OF

00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:53.137
OCCASIONAL CAREER.

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:54.271
OR GO ON TO COLLEGE AND ARE

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:55.906
ASSUMING THAT DEBTAND WHAT THAT

00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:57.341
MEANS IS CERTAINLY THINK THERE'S

00:37:57.408 --> 00:37:59.110
ENOUGH CONTENT HERE BUT WHERE WE

00:37:59.176 --> 00:37:59.977
ARE NOT.

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:01.979
OUT YET IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:03.681
PROBABLY ADD ON ANOTHER

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:05.316
SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF CURRICULUM

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:07.318
WITHOUT FUNDING TO BACK THAT UP

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:08.786
SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU IN YOUR

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:10.087
PEERS ON TO STAY.

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:11.756
WITH US ON THIS ISSUE AS WE

00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:12.990
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD

00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:14.125
PROBABLY THE BEST AVENUE RIGHT

00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:15.760
NOW IS TO PURSUE THIS WITH LOCAL

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:16.927
DISTRICTS AND THOSE THAT HAVE

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:18.329
THE CAPACITY TO EXPAND.

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:20.765
BUT IT IS CERTAINLY WORTHWHILE

00:38:20.831 --> 00:38:22.299
AND SOMETHING THAT WE NEED.

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:26.137
THANK YOU SOME A MEMBER RUSSELL

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:26.437

OKAY.

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:29.407
HI.

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:30.675
BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A NEW

00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:33.077
SLOGAN THAT'S BEEN POPULARIZED

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:34.912
AND IT SAYS THIS IS WHAT

00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.047
DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE.

00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:37.648
IF ANYBODY'S BEEN OUT ON THE

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:40.117
MARCH THAT'S WHAT'S USED --

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:43.020
SO I WANT TO THANK YOU.

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:44.221
FOR ALL OF THESE PRESENTATIONS

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:45.890
NOT JUST YOUR OWN --

00:38:45.956 --> 00:38:47.958
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT YOU ARE

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:49.393
MAKING PROPOSALS.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:53.130
THAT GROW DEMOCRACY IN OUR WHOLE.

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:55.933
STATE IN OUR WHOLE SOCIETY SO

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.701
THAT'S THE FIRST THING I WANT TO

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:57.568
SAY.

00:38:57.635 --> 00:39:00.171
AND I SPECIFICALLY --

00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:02.406
OF BELIEVE THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:05.142
MADE TODAY IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:06.811
WE'VE LOST SO MANY.

00:39:06.877 --> 00:39:08.279
LIFE SKILLS.

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:09.914
OUR TYPE OF CLASSES OVER THE

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:14.719
YEAR TO BE SO FOCUSED ON GOOD

00:39:14.785 --> 00:39:16.821
THINGS LIKE MATH AND SCIENCE

00:39:16.887 --> 00:39:18.622
THAN OTHERS AND I'M NOT SAYING

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.091
TO DO AWAY WITH THOSE AND I KNOW

00:39:20.157 --> 00:39:21.492
YOU WEREN'T EITHER.

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:23.994
BUT THESE LIFE SKILLS OR JUST

00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:25.362
CRITICAL --

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:27.398
ARE IN A NON PROFIT THAT I

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:30.201
STARTED A WE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL

00:39:30.267 --> 00:39:32.103
TO DO A SUMMER PROGRAM WE DID

00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:33.704
THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:35.973
AND ONE YEAR WE SAID WELL WHY

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.642
DON'T WE ASK THE STUDENTS WHAT

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:40.077
THEY THINK.

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:41.312
SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE SUMMER

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:43.214
PROGRAM.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.648
AT THE TOP OF THE LIST.

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:46.984
AND THIS IS A A POOR WORKING

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:49.153
CLASS IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY --

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.621
THEY SAID THE STUDENTS SAID

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:52.456
FINANCIAL LITERACY --

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:54.225
AND I WAS REALLY SURPRISED

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:57.061
TRUTHFULLY BECAUSE I GREW UP OF

00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:58.129
THINKING --

00:39:58.195 --> 00:40:00.731
WHY DO I NEED FINANCIAL LITERACY

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:03.067
IF I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY --

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:05.269
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A DUMB WAY OF

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:07.838
LOOKING AT IT BUT I'VE LEARNED

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:11.976
OVER THE THAT I HAD THAT.

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:13.911
EARLIER IN MY LIFE I WOULDN'T

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:15.946
HAVE BEEN INTIMIDATED BY IT AND

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:18.082
I WOULD HAVE USED IT IN A USE MY

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:20.718
SKILL IN A SMARTER WAY.

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:21.986
SO -- I

00:40:22.052 --> 00:40:23.821
DON'T KNOW ALL THE PARTICULARS

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:25.322
OF THE FUNDING AND I BELIEVE

00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:26.190
THAT.

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:27.958
IN A WAY TO BE FOR THEIR

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:30.694
EDUCATED BY MY COLLEAGUES BUT I

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:33.964
DO THINK YOU ARE RAISING VERY

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:35.432
VERY IMPORTANT THEY'RE NOT.

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:37.434
YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT WE

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:38.569
SHOULD JUST BRUSH TO THE SIDE

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:41.505
YOU'RE RAISING SOME CORE ISSUES --

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:43.174
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND SO I

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.776
APPRECIATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:40:45.843 --> 00:40:47.311
SENATOR.

CENTER WILK BY SHARE.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.948
THANK YOU AND SHARE A GREAT

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:52.183
PRESENTATION FACT ALL THE PRISON

00:40:52.249 --> 00:40:53.417
AND PRESENTATIONS AS FAR HAVE

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:54.552
BEEN --

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.554
EXCELLENT --

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.888
I THE I THINK YOU'RE I THINK

00:40:57.955 --> 00:40:59.557
YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE MONEY OUT I

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:01.025
WHICH I SCHOOL A LONG TIME AGO

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:01.992
AND I DON'T RECALL IF IT WAS

00:41:02.059 --> 00:41:03.627
REQUIRED OR NOT BUT WE HAD WE

00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:04.929
HAD A WHOLE SEMESTER.

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:06.030
WHERE WE LEARNED ALL THESE LIFE

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:07.331
SKILLS?

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:08.632
AND IT IS NOT TAUGHT ANYMORE NO

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:11.068
FOR MY OWN CHILDREN I HAD TO TO

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:11.969
TEACH THEM.

00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:14.171
ABOUT FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:17.274
BUT THEY WERE FORTUNATE TO GROW

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:19.009
UP IN A DAY TWO FAST TWO PARENT

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:19.677
HOME.

00:41:19.743 --> 00:41:21.245
WITH ENGAGE PARENTS AND I KNOW

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:22.847
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE SO MY

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:24.081
DISTRICT IS.

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:26.784
MORE THAN LA COUNTY AND SAN

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:29.553
BERNARDINO COUNTY ONE OUT OF

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.989
EVERY THREE FOSTER YOUTH IN ALL

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:33.524
OF LA COUNTY.

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:34.859
NOW RESIDES IN IN A VALLEY AND I

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:37.528
THINK ABOUT THOSE STUDENTS AND

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:39.697
AS MENTIONED EARLIER.

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:40.564
THOSE WHOSE TO SUPPLY NEED IT

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:41.532
THE MOST AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:43.133
NOT GETTING THOSE RESOURCES SO

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.135
THAT THE ASSEMBLY CHAIR SHARED --

00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:46.604
CHALLENGES.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.639
THAT WE FACE --

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:49.840
WE TYPICALLY HAVE A A TO A TYPE

00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:50.941
DEAL LIKE THIS EVERY YEAR THAT

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:52.743
DOESN'T GET ACROSS TO THE

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.178
GOVERNOR'S DESK.

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:55.846
SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU.

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:56.981

THAT AND ONE DAY MAYBE WE CAN

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:00.484
GET PEOPLE TO TO STEP UP AND DO

00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:02.586
THE RIGHT THING OR FIGURE OUT A

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:05.723
A MORE CREATIVE WAY. TO TO MOVE

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:06.724
MANEUVER AGAIN BUT I I JUST

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:07.725
THINK THESE ARE ESENTIAL SKILLS

00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:10.060
THAT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE NEED AND

00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:12.062

WONDERFUL IF YOU CAN GET AGREE

00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:19.904
GRADE ON A PAPER BUT ONCE YOU

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.138
GET A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG IN

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.506

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:27.411
WHAT WAS YOUR GPA IN COLLEGE BUT

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:28.712
WHAT THEY DO WANT TO KNOW IS CAN

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:31.048
YOU ADULT AS YOU WERE SAYING HOW

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.383

CURRICULUM HOW DO WE FIND A WAY

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:37.855
TO MAKE SURE IT'S ACTUALLY

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:40.357
HAPPENING I THINK STARTING AS

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.622
MISTRUST AND RELATIONSHIPS AMONG

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:27.591
STUDENTS AND FACULTY.

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:28.992
THIS IS DETRIMENTAL TO

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:30.394
FACILITATING EFFECTIVE LEARNING

00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:32.096

00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:55.652
IN MANY CASES IT IS THE FEAR OF

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:57.488
JUDGMENT AND SOCIETAL STIGMA AS

00:45:57.554 --> 00:45:58.856

TALK TO SOMEONE --

00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:02.358
AND I WOULD BE KIND OF SCARED IN

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:04.260
A WAY REGARDLESS OF BEING

00:56:04.327 --> 00:56:05.729
ASSAULTED I WOULD BE SCARED.

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:07.130
TO TELL A TRUSTED ADULT BECAUSE

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.031
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE PROPER

00:56:08.098 --> 00:56:09.532
PROTOCOL IS.

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:12.135
AND DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:14.304
PROTOCOLS LIKE HANDBOOKS OR OR

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:15.905
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:16.740
OTHER.

00:56:16.806 --> 00:56:18.975
POLICIES OR PROCEDURES ARE

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:21.644
COMMUNICATED TO STUDENTS.

00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:23.646
FROM IF I MAKE COMMENTS ON I

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:24.647
REMEMBER --

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:25.915
IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SCHOOL

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:27.217
YEAR THAT WE HAVE A DAILY

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:28.752

00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:30.653
IT READS THE NEWS AND I DO

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.821
REMEMBER IN THE BEGINNING THEY

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:32.989
MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT IT

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:34.023
HOWEVER.

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:35.558
IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN MENTIONED

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:38.561
AGAIN AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE

00:56:38.628 --> 00:56:40.063
TO GO FOR ANYTHING IT WAS

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.732
MENTIONED ONCE AND IT'S KIND OF

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:46.369
NEVER MENTIONED AGAIN.

00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:48.571
SHE WAS ON OTHER SUBJECTS.

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:50.273
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ON OTHER

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.342
SUBJECTS ARE THOSE COMMUNICATED

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:54.544
OR DONE IN A BROADER WAY ARE

00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:56.179
GIVEN OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE NOT

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:58.615
SPECIFICALLY THE SEXUAL ASSAULT.

00:56:58.681 --> 00:57:00.183
ARMED FOR BULLYING THERE'S A LOT

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.252
OF BULLYING POSTERS I CAN GO

00:57:02.318 --> 00:57:03.653
INTO ANY CLASSROOM AND THERE'S

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.755
THIS WE TA POSTER AND IT HAS

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.957
LIKE A CELL PHONE AND THERE'S

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:08.958

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:18.007
OUR LINE ITEM WAS TAKEN AWAY

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:19.575
WITH IT.

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:21.244
EVER SINCE THEN OUR FUNDING HAS

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.478
COME FROM FEES REQUIRED FROM

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:25.348

HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT.

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:37.727
THESE CONFERENCES ARE EXPENSIVE

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:40.029
TO ATTEND BUT ONE CASK WAS STILL

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:41.431
RECEIVING FUNDING BY THE STATE.

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:43.099
THEY COST LESS THAN A LOT FOR

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.667
MORE DIVERSE DELEGATION TO THE

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:47.503
AVAILABILITY OF SCHOLARSHIPS TO

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:48.838
GET STUDENTS TO ATTEND PROGRAMS.

NEVER REGRET IT.

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:53.910
BUT IT WOULD IS REGRETTABLE

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:55.611
HOWEVER IS A FACT THAT STUDENTS

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:57.313
THAT STAND TO BENEFIT THE MOST

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.850
FROM OUR LEADERSHIP TRAINING-CANNOT AFFORD THEM IN OUR POOLER

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:02.151

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:05.855
CONTINUE TO DIMINISH.

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:07.056

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:08.157

THE ONLY YOUR SUPPORT CAN HELP

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:15.898
BREAK.

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:17.467
WE HAVE MADE CONSISTENT EFFORTS

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.935
TO INCLUDE ALL VOICES.

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:20.536
BUT IS BECOME NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:22.038
TO DO SO A CERTAIN GROUPS OF

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:23.139
STUDENTS SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:24.841

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.609
CAST CANNOT AFFORD TO SEND LOW

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:33.783
FUNDING.

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.485
THERE'S FAR TOO LITTLE MONEY FOR

01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:36.586
SCHOLARSHIPS.

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.521
AS A RESULT.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.922
WE'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:41.691
PROPOSE AN AUGMENTATION TO THE

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:43.993

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:48.131
AND THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.098
EITHER --

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:51.267
YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE --

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.768
THE YMCA'S YOUTH IN GOVERNMENT

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:55.171

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:04.747

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.482
ORDER TO CONTINUE PROVIDING THE

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.451

US IN THE FIRST PLACE TO COME

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.521
HERE. TO CONDUCT LEADERSHIP

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:15.057
TRAINING IN THAT WE SEEK TO BE

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:17.326
WE NEED THE SUPPORT FROM THE

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:22.498
STATE TO CONTINUE TO SURVIVE. TOBE SPECIFIC EVEN MORE SPECIFIC

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:24.567
TWO THIRDS OF THIS MONEY WILL GO

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:25.935
TOWARD STUDENTS SCHOLARSHIPS FOR

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:28.838
OUR CONFERENCES.

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:29.605
THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:31.340
DOLLARS THIS WOULD EFFECTIVELY

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:33.543
ELIMINATE THE BARRIEROF ENTRY

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.044
ENSURING THAT NO STUDENT WHO IS

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.113
INTERESTED IS TURNED AWAY FROM

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.447
ANY OF OUR EXTRAORDINARY

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:40.316

FAMILY FINANCES.

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.186
BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:45.221
IS SIMPLY NOT FAIR.

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:46.722
IT'S COMPLETELY AND I UNDERSTAND

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:47.957
IT'S COMPLETELY POSSIBLE TO

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:49.258
BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T NEED THE

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:52.528

ULTIMATELY NOT REPRESENTATIVE.

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:08.744
OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA MOST OF IT.

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:10.112
PROBABLY YES.

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:11.881
BUT WE CAN DO MORE IN TO US THIS

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:14.050

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:26.963
THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IS REALLY

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.764
AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF
