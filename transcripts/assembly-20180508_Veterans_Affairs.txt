VETERANS TO RETURN HOME WITH A FULL DISABILITY SACRIFICE THEIR LIVELIHOOD. TWO IN. LIGHT LIVELIHOODS TO IN THE SERVICE OF PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY. THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION ESTIMATES ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DISABLED VETERANS QUALIFY FOR THE CURRENT PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. WHICH REDUCES THE PROPERTY TAX LIABILITY FOR QUALIFIED VETERAN WHO. DUE TO A SERVICE CONNECTED INJURY OR DISEASE. HAS BEEN RATED ONE HER PERCENT DISABLED OR ARE BEING COMPENSATED AT THE HUNTER PERCENT RATE DUE TO LACK OF EMPLOYABILITY. THE RISING COST OF HOME PRICES ARE DRIVING VETERANS. OUT OF CALIFORNIA. THIS MEASURE WOULD PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO THOSE VETERANS THAT WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED IN SERVICE TO THE NATION. AND TO THEIR FAMILIES. CALIFORNIA MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE SACRIFICE OF THOSE WHO SERVE OUR NATION IN CREATE OPPORTUNITIES IN SUPPORT FOR SURVIVING SPOUSES. AND THEIR FAMILIES TO REMAIN IN CALIFORNIA.

HIS BALANCE AGAINST THE COST OF LIVING. IN CALIFORNIA. MAINTAINING OUR VETERAN POPULATION ALSO WILL SUPPORT LOCAL ECONOMIES BY VIRTUE OF THE FLOW OF FEDERAL DOLLARS TO VETERANS THAT IT THAT IS EXPENDED AND CALIFORNIA. THE BILL PROPOSED INCREASES INCREASE TO THE STATE'S EXISTING PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION WILL HELP OUR VETERANS IN FILMS REMAIN. IN OUR GOLDEN STATE. PLEASE JOIN ME IN HONORING THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN HAVE SACRIFICED SO SO MUCH FOR OUR COUNTRY BY SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS CHAIR WILSON. PASS STATE COMMANDER OF THE DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA DISABLED AMERICAN. VETERANS. THANK YOU CHAIR IRWIN VICE CHAIR VOCAL. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF THE D. A. V. DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT OUR VIEWS ON ASSEMBLY BILLTHIRTY TWO OH NINE. THE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE. DISABLED VETERANS AND THEIR UNMARRIED SURVIVING SPOUSE TAX LEVY AS YOU KNOW DE AB IS A NONPROFIT VETERANS SERVICE ORGANIZATION COMPRISED OF ONE POINT THREE MILLION MORE TIME SERVICE DISABLED VETERANS NATIONWIDE. AND HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA DEDICATED TO A SINGLE PURPOSE EMPOWERING VETERANS TO LEAD HIGH QUALITY LIVES IN RESPECT AND DIGNITY. TO HELP FOR FILLED THOSE PROMISES. TO THE MEN AD WOMEN WHO SERVED DAB ADVOCATES FOR OUR DISABLED VETERANS THEIR SPOUSES AND DEPENDENTS. THIS BILL THE FULL VALUE OF A TOTALLY DISABLED VETERANS RESIDENTS FROM EVERYONE PROPERTY TAX AND EXTEND THE FULL VALUE TAXES I'M XIN TO THE VETERANS SURVIVING SPOUSE. VETERANS WHO RETURN WILL RETURN HOME TOTALLY DISABLED DUE TO THEIR ON WILL SERVICE TO THIS GREAT COUNTRY OFTENTIMES HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. IN SUPPORT OF THEMSELVES OR THEIR FAMILIES. OFTENTIMES THESE VETERANS HAVE A CAPPED INCOME MEANING THEY CANNOT GO AND ASK FOR OVERTIME TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR LIMITED INCOME. SO AS A RISING HOME PRICES IN CALIFORNIA TO KENYA TRIES EXPENDABLE INCOME CONTINUES TO DWINDLE AWAY. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE THE MEANS TO MAKE SURE OUR DISABLED VETERANS AND THEIR UNMARRIED SURVIVING SPOUSES CAN STAY IN THEIR HOMES. THE JOB SO JUSTIFIABLY DESERVED. TO EMPHASIZE THIS POINT THE AUTHOR OF AB THIRTY TWO OR NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER IN HIS STATEMENT CLEARLY STATES THE MEASURE WOULD PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO THOSE VETERANS. THAT WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED IN SERVICE U NATION AND THEIR FAMILIES CALIFORNIA MUST RECOGNIZE THE SACRIFICE OF THOSE WHO SERVED OUR NATION AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORT FROM SURVIVING SPOUSES AND THEIR FAMILIES REMAIN IN CALIFORNIA. THE D. A. B. ALSO REVIEWED THE A. B. THIRTY TILL NINE ANALYSIS REPORT. FOR THIS IN THE COMMITTEE ON REVENUE AND TAXATION HEARING. ON APRIL TWENTY THIRD TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WHICH STATED ON PAGE TWO FISCAL AFFECT THE STATE BOARD OFEQUALIZATION POV ESTIMATES AT THIS BILL RESULT IN A STATEWIDE ANNUAL PROPERTY TAX. REVENUE LOSS OF NINETY ONE POINT ONE MILLION GRANTED THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT HIT TO THE STATE. COUNTIES MUNICIPALITIES TAX REVENUE COFFERS HOWEVER THE DAB TAKES EXCEPTION TO DANCE ANALYSIS BECAUSE OF THE ALGORITHMS USE AN ANALYSIS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR NET AFFECT. THE TAX SAVINGS REALIZED BY THE DISABLED VETERAN AND THEIR FAMILIES WILL HAVE ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY. FROM A PURELY ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW THE DISABLED VETERAN WILL BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO PER SEARCH PURCHASE MUCH NEEDED GOODS AND SERVICES THUS CREATING ADDITIONAL TAX REVENUE STREAMS. BACK TO THE STATE COUNTIES AND MUNICIPALITIES. THE TAX REVENUE LOSS RUBIO HE SAYS WOULD BE REALIZED IN ALL ACTUALITY WOULD BE A FRACTION OF WHAT TO BE ALWAYS ESTIMATED. NINE ONE NINETY ONE POINT ONE MILLION IS PROJECTED TO BE IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT COLOR OF MONEY COMING BACK AS TAXES GENERATED THROUGH OTHER REVENUE SOURCES. THEREFORE WE QUESTION. IS IT REALLY A TAX DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR REVENUE LOSS OR SOME FRACTION THEREOF. AS THE OFFER OF AB THIRTY TWO OR NINE SILLY JIM FRAZIER PUT IT. AB THIRTY CHAU NINE WOULD HELP ENSURE OUR DISABLED VETERANS REMAINING CALIFORNIA IN THAT OPTION OF LIVING NEAR MEDICAL AND BASS FACILITIES AS WELL AS CEMETERIES. PLACES A FINAL TERMINATE BALANCED AGAINST THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL PROPOSED INCREASE TWO THE STATE'S EXISTING PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION WILL HELP ARE VETERANS OF FAMILIES REMAIN IN OUR GOLDEN STATE. IF TAXES FLORIDA IN ILLINOIS IS JUST NAME A FEW STATES THAT ARE FORWARD LOOKING AND CAN HONOR THEIR STATE'S.
