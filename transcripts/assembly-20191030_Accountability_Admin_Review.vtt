MOST RELEVANT SELLING QUESTIONS

DAY ONE. THAT IS ONE OF THE

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:09.247
MOST PAINFUL QUESTIONS IT IS

00:34:09.313 --> 00:34:09.781
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:11.749
DYING IN SO MANY KIDS GOING IN

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:15.353

BE. AND THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:29.834
ADDRESSED TO AND THAT GETS VERY

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:31.536
COMPLICATED BECAUSE THAT CALLS

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:33.204
FOR OUTSIDE HELP AND IT'S A

00:34:33.271 --> 00:34:35.273
VERY STICKY THING BUT YOU KNOW

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:37.708
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SEVERE MENTAL

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:39.310
ILLNESS. SOME DON'T- BUT-

00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:41.512
WILLINGNESS TO GO TO ANY

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:42.079
LENGTHS SOME PEOPLE TO BE ON

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:45.483
THE GRASP OF. IT'S AMAZING TO

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.652
SIT MEANINGS IN TWO PEOPLE

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:49.587
SHARE AND TALKING TO PEOPLE GO

00:34:49.654 --> 00:34:50.221
IN AND OUT AND TO TRY TO FIGURE

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:53.558
THAT OUT. YOU HAVE TO PUT IT

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:55.293

THERE IS NO WAY TO DETERMINE.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.552
WHO'S READY AND WHO'S NOT

00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:22.153
EXCEPT BY WHAT THEIR ACTIONS

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.656
ARE- I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WHO

00:35:25.723 --> 00:35:29.193
HAVE LOST LOVED ONES JOBS HOMES

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.662
EVERYTHING AND THEY STILL ARE

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:35.132
READY- IT'S A VERY ELUSIVE.

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:37.335
ELUSIVE THING WHAT YOU NEED TO

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:41.539

DOCTORS KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:03.254
COVERING AN ADDICTION AND IF

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:03.854
THEY'RE TRAINED TO TREAT THE

00:37:03.921 --> 00:37:05.389
SYMPTOMS THEY'RE TRAINED TO

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:07.191

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:43.154
THOSE ISSUES. THEN WHEN YOU ADD

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.156
IN THE DIRECTION WITH POSSIBLY

00:38:45.222 --> 00:38:47.324
A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE IT

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:49.393
COMPLICATES IT EVEN MORE

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.629
BECAUSE- SOMEBODY WILL EVEN IF

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:52.229
TWO OF THOSE ISSUES WOULDN'T

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:53.464
NECESSARILY DO WELL ON

00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:55.399
EMERGENCY SHELTER. AND

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:57.334
CERTAINLY INTO PERMANENT

00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:59.336
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IF WE HAD

00:38:59.403 --> 00:39:01.972
THEM WHICH WE HAVE A HUGE LACK

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:05.142
OF BAD WOULDN'T NECESSARILY DO

00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:07.344
WELL THERE SO WE HAVE LOCKED UP

00:39:07.411 --> 00:39:09.080
WHAT ARE SOME OTHER

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:11.315
ALTERNATIVES. TO THOSE TWO

00:39:11.382 --> 00:39:13.617
SCENARIOS AND WILL CONTINUE TO

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:19.223
HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.492
IS THERE A THIRD FOR THREE

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:25.396
FIFTH TYPE OF LOSING SO THAT WE

00:39:25.463 --> 00:39:29.266
HAVEN'T LOOKED AT AT AND.

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.535
WITHOUT YES. SPENDING A LOT OF

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:32.136
TIME TALKING ABOUT MY BROTHER

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:33.404
BUT I GUESS IT'S IN A YEAR ONE

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:35.272
YEAR TWO WEEKS AGO THAT HE

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:37.541
PASSED AWAY IT IS NOT SOMETHING

00:39:37.608 --> 00:39:41.212
THAT OF COURSE JUST THE FACTS

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:41.846
THAT INDIVIDUAL IS YOU KNOW IT

00:39:41.912 --> 00:39:43.414
AFFECTS THEIR FAMILY MY MOTHER.

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:47.084
IS EIGHTY FOUR AND HAS SUFFERED

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:51.388
INCREDIBLY SENSES PASSING- AS

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:53.257
WELL AS- ALL OF US SO. I THINK

00:39:53.324 --> 00:39:55.593
THAT WHEN PEOPLE TO HAVE THAT

00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:57.661
INTERACTION THEY CAN HAVE THE

00:39:57.728 --> 00:39:59.396
EMPATHY AND SYMPATHY TO NOT

00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:03.067
JUST DISCARD PEOPLE. AND NOT TO

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:03.567
JUST GIVE UP BUT THERE'S

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:05.770
ANOTHER PART WHERE. I MEAN I

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:09.173
CAN'T TELL YOU IN MY WORK HOW

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.208
MANY TIMES I'VE HAVE HEARD WHAT

00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:11.809
JUST PUT HIM ON A BUS AND SEND

00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:15.246
THEM OUT TO THE DESERT. OR

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:15.846
LET'S JUST SEND THEM THE SAN

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.381
BERNARDINO OR IN A ORANGE

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:19.650
COUNTY IS A GREAT PLACE BUT

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:21.318
THINGS ARE SO EXPENSIVE AND WE

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:23.254
REALLY WHY WOULDN'T WE SEND

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.356
THEM TO A AREA WHERE. THE COST

00:40:25.422 --> 00:40:27.458
OF LIVING IS CHEAPER AND THEN

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:29.260
IT ALL MAKES SENSE AND THESE

00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:31.295
ARE NOT SOLUTIONS THEIR

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:33.397
SIMPLISTIC. IN A VERY COMPLEX

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:35.533
WORK. AND IT WAS ELECTED

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:37.468
LEADERS IT'S OUR JOB TO NOT

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:41.372
MOVE INTO A PATHWAYS THAT TAKE

00:40:41.438 --> 00:40:43.240
US DOWN A ROAD OF. A LEAN

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:45.476
TOWARDS A SOLUTION THAT IS

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:47.211
ABSOLUTELY NOT A SOLUTION IF

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:49.213
YOU ASK CENTER BERNIE DO YOU

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:49.780
KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD THINK

00:40:49.847 --> 00:40:51.582
ABOUT THAT. I DON'T THINK THEY

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:53.551
WOULD THINK THAT WAS GREAT IF

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:55.286
U. S. DESERT CITIES BUT THERE

00:40:55.352 --> 00:40:57.454
COULD BE SOLUTION IN. AN

00:40:57.521 --> 00:41:01.258
INCREDIBLE. MARK BECAUSE WITH

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:07.364
SOME FIRST PLEASE WOULD BE THE

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:07.998
IDEA THAT THERE COULD BE A HOST

WE'RE HAPPY TO HOST IT COULD

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:15.439
PROVIDE JOBS BUT THAT HAS TO BE

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:16.040
A MUTUAL AGREEMENT VERSUS WAS

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:19.276
JUST PACK EVERYBODY UP AND GET

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:21.512

ON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CLUBS ALL

00:41:24.248 --> 00:41:27.685
THOSE FACING. I THINK THAT THE

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:29.153
SIMPLE FACT IS THAT THE INNER

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.355

SPEAK TO THE BACKGROUND CHECKS

YEAH THE ISSUE. OF FOR A NUMBER

00:48:58.935 --> 00:48:59.836
OF YEARS PROBATION DEPARTMENT

00:48:59.903 --> 00:49:03.974
HAD AND. APPROVED LIST OF

00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:07.477
FACILITY. AND IT. CRIER AND OF

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:09.379
THAT WAS THAT EVERYONE STAFF

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:11.448
ALSO REQUIRED A MINIMUM OF TWO

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:13.517
YEARS OF SOBRIETY THERE REALLY

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:15.285
ISN'T ANY BACKGROUND CHECK ON

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:17.387
YEARS OF SOBRIETY. BUT IT. IT

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:19.489
WOULD BE REALLY ALL THAT A

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:20.023
PERSON HAD STOPPED GETTING

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.491
ARRESTED IN GETTING IN TROUBLE

00:49:21.558 --> 00:49:23.360
THE PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THAT

00:49:23.427 --> 00:49:23.960
THEY HAD THEY HAD GOTTEN SOBER

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:25.829
THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:26.430
DISBANDED THAT UNIT BECAUSE OF

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:29.800
FUNDING. BUT WHEN THAT UNIT WAS

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:33.136
OPERATIONAL THE COURTS. WOULD

00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:35.539
NOT SEND ANYONE TO A PROGRAM

00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:36.139
THAT WAS NOT ON THEIR APPROVED

00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:37.908
LIST THEREFORE. YOU KNOW

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:39.409
KNOWING ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

WORK THERE HAD PASSED A

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:41.745
BACKGROUND CHECK THE ONE

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.380
DRAWBACK ON A BACKGROUND CHECK

00:49:43.447 --> 00:49:45.382
IS IT ONLY TELLS YOU AN ARREST

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:47.718
RECORD. AND SO YOU WOULD HAVE A

00:49:47.784 --> 00:49:49.353
PROBLEM MAKING A VALUE JUDGMENT

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:51.855
WITH IS THEIR ARREST RECORDS SO

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:53.890
HORRIBLE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:55.425
ALLOWED TO DO THIS WHEN IN MANY

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:57.661
CASES THAT COULD BE THE VERY.

00:49:57.728 --> 00:49:59.596
IMPETUS FOR SOMEONE TO GET

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:01.598
SOBER AND THAT WOULD BE A VERY

00:50:01.665 --> 00:50:03.033
VALUABLE THING FOR THEM TO HAVE

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:03.700
BUT IT CERTAINLY WOULD TELL YOU

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:05.202
THAT THE PERSON. ISN'T

00:50:05.268 --> 00:50:07.471

PAROLE AND OPERATING A FACILITY

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:11.575
BECAUSE NO ONE ON PROBATION OR

00:50:11.641 --> 00:50:13.610
PAROLE SHOULD OPERATE. A SOBER

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:14.177
LIVING RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT

MY ORGANIZATION AT ADVOCATES TO

INCREASING STATE OUR SITE IS A

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:01.350

THROUGH HIM. SUPPORT THE BILL

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:11.194
THAT THAT EXISTED THIS YEAR

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.329
NINE TWENTY AND IF THIS BILL

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:13.930
COMES UP AGAIN IF WE CAN MAKE

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:14.397
SOME OF THE FINANCIAL

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:15.565
ARRANGEMENTS THIS BILL STARTED

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:16.132
IN THE SENATE I THINK JERRY

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:16.766
WILL START THE BILL AND THEN IT

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:17.433
MOVED TO THE ASSEMBLY AS BILLS

LAST YEAR WE WILL CO SPONSOR

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:25.842
WHICH MEANS WE ARE WILLING TO

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:27.343
PROVIDE EXPERT WITNESS

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.745
TESTIMONY FOR THE- FOR MANY

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:31.347
THINGS AND I THINK. IF YOU HAVE

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:35.318
AND WE WOULD THINK THAT. THAT

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:37.353
WE ARE OUR ORGANIZATION FEELS.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.522
THE ALL EVIDENCE BASED

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.924
TREATMENTS FOR SUBSTANCE USE

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:43.192
DISORDERS ALCOHOLISM ADDICTION

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.862
ISSUES NEED TO BE OFFERED AT

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:47.663
TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.297
GET A LICENSE SO THAT DOESN'T

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:51.400
MEAN THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:51.968
WHO GOES THROUGH TREATMENT

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:55.104
NEEDS TO BE ON MEDICATION

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:55.605
THURMOND EVIDENCE BASED

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:57.507
TREATMENTS WHICH YOU'RE NOT

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:59.775
MEDICAID USUALLY YOU THINK OF

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:00.343
EVENTS PASTRY. THAT INVOLVE

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:03.212
MEDICATIONS. THE SUBOXONE BEING

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:03.813
THE ONE THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.348
THE INJECTABLE- TRAWL IT OR

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:07.416
THAT NOW TRICKS ON AND THERE'S

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:09.185
ALSO AN INJECTABLE FORM OF THE

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:11.521
PEOPLE ARE FEW WHICH WE THINK

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:12.155
IS REALLY REALLY GOING TO TURN

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.389
THINGS AROUND- BUT THAT THERE

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.525
ARE GOOD EVIDENCE PASTRY. FOR

01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:17.326
OTHER SUBSIDIES- DISORDERS THAT

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.729
WE HAVE MEDICATIONS WHICH WORK

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:21.631
WELL FOR OPIATES AND WE HAVE

01:03:21.697 --> 01:03:23.633
MEDICATIONS WHICH WORK WELL FOR

01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:25.535
AL ALL WE HAVE NOTHING FOR

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:26.135
METHAMPHETAMINE OR STIMULANTS

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.436
LIKE COCAINE WE HAVE NOTHING

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:29.772
FOR CANNABIS- IN FACT THERE ARE

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:31.407
GOOD EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:32.041
WHICH DID NOT INVOLVE A DOCTOR

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:35.378
OR PRESCRIPTION- CONTINUE TO

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:37.747
MANAGEMENT WHICH IS AS IT

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:38.347
SHOULD. THE PROGRAM DOES NOT

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:39.282
NEED A DOCTOR TO DO A PRETTY

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:41.551
GOOD EVIDENCE THAT WORKS WELL

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:41.951
IN STIMULANTS- SO

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:43.519
METHAMPHETAMINES WORKS BETTER

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:45.021
THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE'VE HAD.

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:47.590
WE HAVE WE HAVE OTHER EVIDENCE

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.224
BASED TREATMENTS WHAT WE THINK

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:49.525
THAT WITH MY INSURER WILL BE A

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:53.462
LOT OF THE- THE BAD APPLES A

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:54.063
LOT OF THE ABUSE THE INSURANCE

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:59.368
COMPANIES. BUILT. FOR MILLION

01:03:59.435 --> 01:03:59.969
LITTLE NOISE WAS JUST HERE IN

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:03.506
ORANGE COUNTY. WE THINK THAT

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:05.575
THIS THIS THE LICENSING MOBILE

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:07.243
AND A LOT OF. BECAUSE THE

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:07.843
TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:08.477
GET A LICENSE ARE GONNA HAVE TO

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:09.745
COMPLY WITH STATE. AND IF THEY

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:11.547
COMPLY WITH STATE THERE'S THE

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:12.181
THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE BILL

01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:13.516
YOU KNOW. ELEVEN HUNDRED

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:14.150
DOLLARS A POP FOR A URINE TEST

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:15.318
WHICH CAUGHT TWENTY BUCKS AND

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:17.286
THREE TIMES A WEEK. AND BILL

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:17.920
YOU KNOW MILLIONS AND MILLIONS

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:18.521
OF DOLLARS WE ALL KNOW EXIST.

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:19.622
SO WITH. OUR WORK WE'RE IN VERY

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:23.259
MUCH IN FAVOR OF LICENSURE- AND

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:23.826
AN INCREASING OVERSIGHT WE

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:27.930
THINK THIS IS A GOOD THING THIS

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:28.497
WILL HELP PEOPLE. THIS WILL

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:29.298
KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE. ARE WE

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:31.334
OFFERING MEDICATIONS

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:31.934
PARTICULARLY NOW IN CALIFORNIA

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.603
WE'VE HAD. INCREASING ABOUT

01:04:33.669 --> 01:04:34.203
THAT NOTHING OF FENNEL IS NOW

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:35.471
ARRIVING HEALTH. IT WAS HERE

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:37.473
WAS NOT HERE EARLIER. IT'S

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.508
INCREASING WE'RE SEEING

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:40.109
INCREASING NUMBER AS FROM FAT

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:43.346
NOW. OUR PROBABLY THIS YEAR I

01:04:43.412 --> 01:04:43.946
THINK FIRST YEAR RUN PIECE.

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:45.681
THAT METHAMPHETAMINE DOES WILL

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:47.516
NOW EXCEED OPIATE DESK

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:48.050
CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE MORE

01:04:48.117 --> 01:04:49.652
PEOPLE DYING FOR NEW FOR

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.153
METHAMPHETAMINE THAT WE HAVE

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.522
FROM OPIATES AND YOU'LL BE DOES

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:55.191
A RISING BECAUSE FENTON WAS NOW

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:57.727
ARRIVED. PILL FORM. AND SO THE

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:59.328
OTHER THE OTHER THING THAT THAT

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:01.564
IT IT CAME UP IN THE QUESTIONS

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:03.599
THAT YOU SENT ME WORK HOW DO WE

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:04.233
HOW DO WE- YOU KNOW SO THAT WE

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:07.637
HAVE ANY MEDICATIONS WE HAVE AN

01:05:07.703 --> 01:05:08.070
INJECTABLE FORM. THE

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:11.474
BUPRENORPHINE. AND THIS IS THIS

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.074
I THINK IS A REAL GAME CHANGER

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:13.609
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW. MANY

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.411
PEOPLE COME OUT OF TREATMENT

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.913
AND YOU SEE THEM- RIGHT RIGHT

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.514
WHERE WE SIT YOU SEE PEOPLE

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:19.749
COME OUT AND THEY PUT ON

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:21.550
MEDICATIONS IF THEY HAVE. A

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:23.486
HEROIN ADDICTION. AND THE SOBRE

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:25.655
LIVES WON'T TAKE A THE CAN'T IT

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:26.255
INTO A SOBER LIVING IF YOU'RE

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:27.490
ON THESE BUSES FOR THE MEASURE

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.558
NOT GEARED UP TO DISPENSE

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:31.193
MEDICATIONS. SO THEY COME OUT

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:31.794
OF TREATMENT STABLE WE CAN'T

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:33.529

TRICKS. ON THE PATROL WHICH

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:16.305
ALSO WAS A BIG HELP WE HAVE

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:19.342
THAT AVAILABLE NOW. AND AS FAR

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.510
AS- THE OTHER QUESTION THAT WAS

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:22.044
ASKED. IS ABOUT HOW DO WE

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:22.645
FOLLOW PEOPLE. HOW DO WE KNOW

LICENSE TREATMENT FACILITIES

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:25.948
HOW DO WE KNOW. THAT A GOOD

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:26.582
JOB. AND STORE KLAY IT'S BEEN A

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:29.385
VERY DIFFICULT. TO TRACK YOU

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.287
CHRONIC RELAPSING ILLNESS. AS

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:33.589
MY HYPERTENSION DIABETES ARE

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:34.256
YOU COULD FALL THEM YOU GO TO

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:35.891
THE LAB. AND INTO A BLOOD TEST

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.860
YOU CAN ACHIEVING YOUR OFF TO

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:38.427
TAKE THE BLOOD PRESSURE WITH

WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALCOHOLISM

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:43.499
OR ADDICTIONS VERY FICKLE.

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:44.100
HISTORICALLY WE'VE YOU. DRUG

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.801
TESTING. WE USED THE

01:06:45.868 --> 01:06:46.369
INTERACTIONS WITH THE LEGAL

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:47.336
SYSTEM YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:49.739
GET ARRESTED FOR A COUPLE YEARS

01:06:49.805 --> 01:06:50.339
THIS IS USUALLY A SIGN THAT

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:53.142
YOU'RE NOT BACK IN THE DROP. UP

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:57.213
WE'VE USED ER VISITS AS SORT OF.

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:59.749
CIRCUIT MARKERS FOR DRUG USE

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:00.316
CHOOSE A LOT OF WAYS WE CAN

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:01.250
TEST BESIDES DRUG TESTING- IT

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:01.817
IT'S NOT A PERFECT SCIENCE A

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:03.753
IT'S A VERY. COMPLICATED

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:05.154
PROBLEM AND MANY PEOPLE REQUIRE

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.223
DIFFERENT- TREATMENT MODALITIES

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:09.825
TO GET- AND WE ARE YEAH MY

MANY OF THE EARLY PIONEERS IN

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:41.363
ADDICTION TREATMENT CAME OUT OF

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.532
THE ROOM REMOVED SELF THEY WERE

STE I'M IN THE STATE IS A HUGE

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:05.721
PROBLEM IN THAT. PEOPLE DON'T

ABOUT REGION IN AND GET FULL TO

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:13.862
COMMUNICATE. I THINK WITH THE

ADS OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:14.997
THERE'S ALSO. THERE'S ALSO A

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:17.232
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FEDERAL.

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:19.401
PROHIBITION HEARING INFORMATION

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:21.236
SO THIS IS A OF HIPAA AND

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:23.105
THERE'S ENOUGH TO SEE FOR PART

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:23.772
TWO WHICH ARE TWO SEPARATE LAW.

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.474
FEDERAL LAW VERSUS STATE LAW

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:29.678
TERMS SHARING. SO IF I HAVE A-

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:31.613
SOME OF MY OFFICE AND I HAVE A.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.549

PATIENTS WITH IT WITH ADDICTION

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:37.553
ALCOHOLISM. I COLLEAGUES CAN'T

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.555
ALWAYS SEE THAT NOTE. SO IF I

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:41.557
SEND SOMEONE OVER TO GET IT IF

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:42.124
THEY HAVE A HERNIA AND I SEE

SOMETIMES FOR THOSE DOCTORS

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:46.295
LOOK AT THE DATA BECAUSE THERE

01:12:46.361 --> 01:12:47.463
ARE FEDERAL RULES THAT PROHIBIT

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:49.465
THE SHARING OF DATA WE OPERATE

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:51.734
A SILO. AND THE FEDERAL FEDERAL

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.502
LAW TRUMPS STATE LAW AND SO WE

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:55.637
HAVE TO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:56.171
NOW THERE'S SOME FEDERAL

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:57.439
REGULATION BEING CHANGED TO

01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:59.541
ALLOW SHARING INFORMATION BUT

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:03.512
SOME OF IT IS JUST LAW SAYS I

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.714
CAN'T. I CAN'T PUT STUFF ON A

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:06.315
CHART THAT ANOTHER DOCTOR CAN

01:13:06.381 --> 01:13:13.288

THE PANELIST. AND WE'RE ALSO

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:57.392
HAVE ONE TO COME THE NEXT

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.628
PANELIST I'VE ALREADY HEARD IN

01:19:59.694 --> 01:20:01.396
MY NOTES OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:03.298
LEGISLATION AND HAD I NOT

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:05.534
PARTICIPATED I MAY NOT HAVE

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.736
THAT FIRSTHAND. BUT I WILL SAY

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:11.373
THE ONE KEY WORD THAT I'M GOING

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:13.308
TO TAKE AWAY ALREADY FOR MY

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:17.112
WHAT I'VE HEARD IS STILL NOT.

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:17.612
AN AS WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:23.185
ADDICTION. IT GOES IT PAYS TO

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:23.785
ONE KIND OF IMAGE BUT IF YOU

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:24.352
TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY WITH THE

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:27.022
BREAST CANCER OR SOMEBODY. WITH

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:29.457
AS WE SAY DIABETES OR HEART

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:30.058
ATTACK IT GOES IN A DIFFERENT

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:33.295
WAY AND WHEN WE HAVE SOMEBODY A

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:35.130
NEIGHBOR OR A FAMILY MEMBER-

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:37.232
WE'VE JUST HEARD- THERE HAVE

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:39.301
REX BREAST CANCER WE START OUR

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:41.269
FACEBOOK GROUPS TO BRING MEALS

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:43.138
IN OUR CHURCH GROUPS AND-

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:45.240
SURROUND THEM WITH LOVE AND-

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:47.309
HUGS. BUT WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.311
ADDICTION. IT BRINGS IN THIS

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:51.646
THING LIKE WHAT DID THAT FAMILY

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:53.181
DO WERE THEY NOT THERE. UP

01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:57.352
MOTHER NOT THE RIGHT MOTHER ALL

01:20:57.419 --> 01:20:59.287
OF THESE OTHER THINGS AND WHEN

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:01.423
WE SEPARATED MEDICALLY. I MEAN

01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:03.491
IT IS A DISEASE ADDICTION AND

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:04.025
MENTAL HEALTH THOSE ARE A

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:07.329
DISEASES BUT AGAIN BECAUSE THE

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:09.364
WAY THEY ARE- THE EDUCATION

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:13.335
SYSTEM HAS FRAMED- IN MANY WAYS

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:15.237
THEY'RE TAUGHT IT'S SECONDARY

01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:17.405
TO A HEALTH CONDITION. AND AS

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:21.309
WHAT I SEE HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:23.345
IS ONE ISSUE LEADS TO ANOTHER

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:25.413
SO SOMEBODY MIGHT STRUGGLE WITH

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.284
FIRST WEATHER BE ALCOHOLISM OR-

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:29.884
ENDS BUT THEN THAT STARTS TO

01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:31.620
DETERIORATE ON ONLY PHYSICALLY.

01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:33.622
SO THEY HAVE OF COURSE HEALTH

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:35.290
ISSUE. BUT THEN MENTAL HEALTH

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:39.294
ISSUES SO I AM MORE THAN EVER

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:41.630
MOTIVATED FOR US AS A TEAM UP

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:45.300
HERE TO CONTINUE TO BREAK DOWN

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:47.402
SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:49.371
THE PUBLIC RECEIVES. BUT ALSO

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:51.439
THAT WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THE

01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:53.508
INFORMATION THAT WE'VE GAINED

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:55.243
HERE AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT-

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:57.445
BECAUSE WE LOSE ALL TOO MANY

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:59.748
PEOPLE ARE UNDER UMBRELLAS THAT

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:01.316
WE PUT PEOPLE AND SO WHETHER

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:03.652
IT'S ADDICTION WHETHER IT'S

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.654
HOMELESSNESS. YOU KNOW AN

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.489
ORANGE COUNTY OVER THE LAST

AND MAYBE SOME FOLLOW UP. BUT

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:27.374
FOR THESE CASES BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:31.212
SO COMPLICATED AND SO DIFFERENT

01:37:31.278 --> 01:37:31.812
THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE

01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:35.382
TYPICALLY SEE. WE ARE WORKING

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:37.151
ON THESE CASES FROM THE INSIDE

01:37:37.218 --> 01:37:41.288
SO OUR TEAM IS INVESTIGATING

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:41.956
THESE CASES FROM THE GROUND UP

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:43.357
FRONT TIPS WE HAVE WE'VE HAD I

01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:45.593

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:53.300
PREPARING THEM FOR PROSECUTION.

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:55.402
THAT'S A REALLY DIFFERENT

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:57.438
ANIMAL AND IT'S VERY RESOURCE

01:37:57.504 --> 01:37:59.740
INTENSIVE- A COUPLE OF THE

01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:03.210
CASES THAT WE HAVE ON GOING ONE

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:03.744
WAS FILED IN TWO THOUSAND

01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:07.514
SEVENTEEN AND INVOLVES. YOU

01:38:07.581 --> 01:38:08.148
COULD HAVE TAKEN IRAQ FROM OUR

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:11.085
CASE AND THE SCHEMATIC THAT.

01:38:11.151 --> 01:38:13.454
FOLEY SHOWED YOU IT INVOLVED A

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.789
URINALYSIS SCHEME AND THEY'RE

01:38:15.856 --> 01:38:17.491
ACTUALLY WE HAVE ALLEGED AT

THE TASKS- MULTIPLE TIMES AND I

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:31.572
THINK THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.507
LOSS WAS TWENTY TWO MILLION

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:35.476
DOLLARS. SO TWO OF THOSE AT

01:38:35.542 --> 01:38:37.811
DEFENDANTS HAVE PLED GUILTY ONE

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:41.715
HAS PASSED AWAY AND THERE TO

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:43.517
THAT ARE AWAITING TRIAL. SO

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:45.819
THAT'S ONE OF THE CASES THAT ON

01:38:45.886 --> 01:38:47.388

01:39:01.735 --> 01:39:02.136
LAST YEAR THEIR LEVIN

01:39:02.202 --> 01:39:05.339

FRAUDULENT SURGICAL PROCEDURES.

01:39:09.376 --> 01:39:11.178
THAT THEY WERE TELLING PAGE

01:39:11.245 --> 01:39:15.282
PATIENTS WE HAVE ALLEGED I THAT

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:15.849
WOULD ADDRESS THEIR OPIOID

01:39:15.916 --> 01:39:17.551
ADDICTION BUT THIS IS A NON FDA

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:19.486

ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:34.134
AT TO COME IN AND UNDERGO THE

01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:37.371
PROCEDURE THEN BILLING THE

THOUSAND A POP FOR THESE PEOPLE

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:43.344

THEY'RE ALSO HAVING TO ASSIST

01:39:57.257 --> 01:39:57.725
IN THE PROSECUTION SO THAT

01:39:57.791 --> 01:39:59.360
MEANS GETTING THEM READY FOR

THINGS IN AROUND THESE STEPS

01:49:17.918 --> 01:49:19.486
PHONES. THE THING I'M FIRMLY

01:49:19.552 --> 01:49:21.288
BELIEVE THAT I THINK IF WE GET

01:49:21.354 --> 01:49:23.390
IT ABLE TO GET THE RECALL AS AS

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:25.659
AS IN THESE ISSUES AND DRIVE

01:49:25.725 --> 01:49:27.360
OUT THESE PREDATORY OPERATORS

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:29.329
NEEDS UNSCRUPULOUS ACTOR. SOME

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:35.168
OF THIS CAN THESE ANCILLARY.

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:41.107
CONCERNS WILL GO AWAY. CAN I

01:49:41.174 --> 01:49:41.608
ALSO ASK. THE LICENSING

01:49:41.675 --> 01:49:43.576
SPECTERS I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY

01:49:43.643 --> 01:49:45.111
WOMAN- QUIRKS BUT WORKED ON

01:49:45.178 --> 01:49:45.712
TRYING TO GET US ONE IN ORANGE

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:46.279
COUNTY. I KNOW THE GOVERNOR

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:47.747
ADDED MORE MONEY FOR MORE

01:49:47.814 --> 01:49:49.716
INSPECTORS NO ONE IN ORANGE

01:49:49.783 --> 01:49:51.785
COUNTY. AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:53.954
IS OUR CODE ENFORCEMENT ARE-

01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:59.526
SHERIFF'S OFFICERS WE'RE HAVING

01:49:59.592 --> 01:50:03.229
TO BE AND WITH THAT THE STAFF.

01:50:03.296 --> 01:50:05.699
AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THAT

01:50:05.765 --> 01:50:06.232
AS WE LEFT OFF WITH THE-

01:50:06.299 --> 01:50:07.300
LEGISLATION THAT WE WERE NOT

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:09.369
ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH AT THAT

01:50:09.436 --> 01:50:09.936
TIME AS THE CHAIR WOULD NOT

01:50:10.003 --> 01:50:13.606
ACCEPT IT RIGHT. THERE HAS BEEN

01:50:13.673 --> 01:50:15.542
PROGRESS IS NOW WE HAVE A NEW.

01:50:15.608 --> 01:50:19.145
CHAIR I THINK THERE'S MUCH MORE

01:50:19.212 --> 01:50:21.247
OF A PUBLIC THAT'S EDUCATED ON.

01:50:21.314 --> 01:50:23.516
THE STEPS WE NEED TO TAKE SO I

01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:27.387
DO THINK WE CAN RE LOOK AT THAT

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:29.589
BUT I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE

01:50:29.656 --> 01:50:30.190
THINGS WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR

01:50:30.256 --> 01:50:31.624
COMPLIANCE OFFICERS IN ESSENCE

01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:33.526
HEADQUARTERED IN SACRAMENTO FOR

01:50:33.593 --> 01:50:37.597
THE ENTIRE STATE. DID A GOOD

01:50:37.664 --> 01:50:41.468
ROUND ABOUT WELL WE PUT ONE IN

01:50:41.534 --> 01:50:45.438
LOS ANGELES AND I HAVE. QUITE A

01:50:45.505 --> 01:50:46.039
BIT FOR ME SAYING LOS ANGELES

01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:47.340
CAN BE AN HOUR AND A HALF AWAY

01:50:47.407 --> 01:50:51.144
DEPENDING ON TRAFFIC UP MAYBE

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:53.413
FORTY FIVE MINUTES BUT THAT IS

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.382
NOT BASED IN ORANGE COUNTY SO

01:50:55.448 --> 01:50:57.317
WE STILL HAVE STEPS TO TAKE.

01:50:57.384 --> 01:50:59.285
BECAUSE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO

01:50:59.352 --> 01:51:01.821
REASON THAT IF WE HAVE EIGHT

01:51:01.888 --> 01:51:03.456
COMPLIANCE OFFICERS I BELIEVE

01:51:03.523 --> 01:51:05.358
IT'S TEN NOW AT THE STATE THAT

01:51:05.425 --> 01:51:07.360

WEEK IT COULD SIMPLY BE. ONE

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:11.998
DAY A WEEK MAYBE AN ORANGE

01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:13.666
COUNTY SOMEBODY ELSE AND SAN

01:51:13.733 --> 01:51:17.504
DIEGO BECAUSE CERTAINLY. OTHER

01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:18.138
COUNTIES ARE DEALING WITH SOME

01:51:18.204 --> 01:51:21.374
OF THE SAME ISSUES SO ON NOW

01:51:21.441 --> 01:51:23.209
THAT THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE AT

01:51:23.276 --> 01:51:23.710

01:51:27.747 --> 01:51:29.649
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD IN

01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:33.453
