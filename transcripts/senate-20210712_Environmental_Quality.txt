WILDFIRES BLAZING DECADES AHEAD OF WHAT SCIENTISTS HAD ORIGINALLY% SCHEDULED IN TERMS OF ITS SEVERITY. AND SO IT'S CLEAR THAT WE CANNOT GO ON WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL. AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE. SIXTY ACCOMPLISH THREE MAIN OBJECTIVES FIRST TO REQUIRE THE STATE. TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OR NO LATER THAN TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN NET NEGATIVE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THEREAFTER THAT'S ONE. SECOND THIS BILL ALSO WOULD REQUIRE THAT 90% OF OUR STATE'S HUMAN CAUSED EMISSIONS ARE ELIMINATED THROUGH DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS. AND THIRD THIS BILL PRESCRIBES CRITERIA AND SAFEGUARDS FOR THE USE OF CARBON CAPTURE STORAGE. CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES.

TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO. I THIS BILL DOES NOT PLACE. RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF STRATEGIES LIKE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE AND IT RECOGNIZES THAT MASON CARBON REMOVAL TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO AN ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING THAT NEGATIVE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- BUT- RESPECTED IT ALSO CRITICAL TO SET STRICT. STANDARDS FOR THE YOU CAN BE STRATEGIES TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL AIR QUALITY IS NOT HARMED IT STORED CARBON THANK THE WITH INTEGRITY AND THAT COMMUNITIES ECOSYSTEMS AND GROUNDWATER ARE PROTECTED THIS IS REALLY AN. ESSENTIAL PART OF EACH THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE. I DECLINE CRISIS IN URGENTLY NEEDED HEALTHCARE DOES NOT HAVE ANY. WIDE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS STATUTES AFTER TWENTY THIRTY BUT WE NEED TO BE WORKING NOW TOWARD NET NEGATIVE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. MAXIMIZING REDUCTION IN THIS DECADE MEANS GREATER CUMULATIVE REDUCTION WHICH IS NECESSARY CAN MEET OUR NEW COUNTRY GOAL.

FOR DISCUSSION QUESTIONS WILL START WITH US CHAIR EMERITUS. SARAH CASKEY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR I'M ON MY PAGE THIRTEEN AND THE THIRTEEN IN THE FOURTEEN AYE AYE UNFORTUNATELY I WAS NOT VISITED BY ANYBODY IN ORGANIZED LABOR ON THIS BILL THOUGH I'VE HEARD A LOT OF OBJECTIONS TO THE BILL AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH NOBODY IDENTIFIED THAT THERE IS LANGUAGE THAT AFFECTS CARBON CAPTURE BECAUSE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI. I THINK SINCE WE ONLY PRODUCE 1% OF THE GREENHOUSE GASES THE GIFT THAT CALIFORNIA CANGIVE TO PEOPLE IS EXPORTING OUR TECHNOLOGY. I'VE BEEN HERE FOR ELEVEN YEARS I'VE SAID FOR ELEVEN YEARS ALL SAY FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO PUT A CLAMP ON THE TECHNOLOGY- BUT I'LL GET TO SOME OF THE OTHER STUFF SO I'M READING THAT THE LAST BULLET SAYS REQUIRE THE- AIRPORT TO IDENTIFY A VARIETY OF POLICIES. AND STRATEGIES THAT SUPPORT COPPER CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL SOLUTIONS AND CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES IN CALIFORNIA TO COMPLEMENT EMISSION REDUCTIONS. NATURE BASED CLIMATE SOLUTIONS AND ACHIEVE DURABLE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS OR CARBON RENEWABLES AND IT GOES ON TO THE NEXT ONE. SEE YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU HAVE BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN A MARKUPS SO. I'M FLYING HERE. IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT'S IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW IS REMOVED AND THIS IS PUT IN. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. A BOMB. THIS LANGUAGE WHICH IS ONE OF THE STAFF AMENDMENTS- PROPOSED BY THIS COMMITTEE. MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND IT SHOULD BE SENDING A CLEAR MARKET SIGNAL TO ANY OF THE INVESTORS THAT TO. THE- THE CALCHAMBER- I HAD REFERRED TO EARLIER- THAT WE WANT. TO INCENTIVIZE THE INNOVATION AND CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE WE WANT. THE INNOVATION AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL AND- THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THIS BILL. TO DIS INCENTIVIZE THE INVESTMENTS THE INNOVATION IN FACT THIS LANGUAGE MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. THAT WE ARE IN FULLY IN SUPPORT WE ARE MANDATING. TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO COME UP WITH POLICIES AND STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT THESE TECHNOLOGIES. RIGHT I'M I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOUR SUPPORTERS BECAUSE I'VE TALKED WITH THEM- WOULD CRINGE AT THE BIG KNOWLEDGE MAN OF INCINERATION OF OUR WASTE BUT NOW WE IN THE URBAN AREAS IN THE SUBURBAN AREAS LOVE TO LOAD UP OUR WAY SINCE HAVE THE TEAMSTERS GET IN THEIR TRUCKS AND DRIVER THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY. TO DISPOSE OF IT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND WE KNOW THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD INCINERATES AND DOES CARBON CAPTURE AND HAS A ZERO NET IMPACT IN ISN'T. RUNNING RUINING OUR ROAD SERVICE- STRESSING OUT OUR ROADS WITH WITH LOADS AND LOADS OF OUR GARBAGE SO- I WOULD THINK IN THAT SPIRIT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE WOULD HOPE TO DEVELOP THAT ONE DAY WE ALL BREATHE EASIER ABOUT. USING TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE OUR CARBON CAPTURE- I THINK THIS ENOUGH MISTER. OKAY YES CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND- YOUR DURABILITY AND PUSHING FORWARD FOR YEARS NOW IN INSISTING ON. SOMETHING MORE THAN WHAT WE'VE GOT ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE I THINK THAT RESTING ON OUR LAURELS THAT WHILE THE WHOLE STATES ON FIRE AND HEAT IS A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES IN. IF PEOPLE ARE LIVING NEAR FREEWAYS AND- YOU KNOW EXPECTING MOTHERS ARE HURTING AND- EVEN YOUR NEED TO. GO THROUGH WE DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST BUT- WE HAVE TO BE BOLD- MY MAIN QUESTION FOR YOU IS JUST- ARE WE BOTH ENOUGH- THE GOVERNOR SENT A LETTER TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD I BELIEVE ON FRIDAY- ASKING FOR THEM TO STUDY- THE FEASIBILITY OF A- NEAR TERM. APPROACH TO NEUTRALITY ORDERED TEN AT ZERO- I THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY GO FURTHER THAN THAT ZERO I THINK WE CAN GO TO NET NEGATIVE BY THIRTY FIVE BASED ON THE MODELS WE'VE SEEN. IT HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU WRESTLE WITH THAT WITH THIS LEGISLATION ARE YOU PRECLUDING US FROM THINKING BIGGER IF TECHNOLOGY DOES ENABLE LITERACY OR BOARD SAYS WE HAVE TO WORK- TO MEET OUR GOALS I MEAN. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU WRESTLE WITH THAT SORT OF. NOT THE FORTY FIVE VISION BUT THAT THIRTY FIVE VISION. ABSOLUTELY NOT CENTER AND IN FACT I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR BILL LEADERSHIP AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAD. YOUR BILL THAT- IT LOOKS LIKE THE GOVERNOR IS FOLLOWING YOUR LEAD IN TERMS OF CALLING. FOR EXPLORING AVENUES TO THE POSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY. BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE NOT NINE WAITING UNTIL MID CENTURY LIKE. LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD I LIKE ART LIKE AREN'T NOT A NATION LIKE PRESIDENT BIDEN CALLED FOR- BUT- FOR CALIFORNIA TO REASSERT. ITS LEADERSHIP BY YOU KNOW EXPLORING WAYS TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY BY NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND SO WE CERTAINLY WELCOME YOU KNOW YOUR LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP- YOU KNOW IN CALLING FOR THE A RP TO EXPLORE THIS. THIS BILL- IS THE BACKSTOP IT'S- EIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PURSUING. NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS AGGRESSIVELY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE TO SAVE OUR PLANET FROM THE EXTREME HEAT FROM THE DROUGHTS FROM THE WILD FIRES. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE THAT IT'S WORKABLE THAT THAT THEY'VE WORKABLE AND VERIFIABLE AND SO- YOU KNOW. WAIT TO ALL THOSE WHO SAY THAT THEY THEY CAN ENTER VAPED ARE ARE YOU KNOW OUR WAY OUT OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS MORE POWER TO THEM YOU KNOW WE WANT MORE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE WE WANT MORE CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL. BUT YOU KNOW LET'S LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THAT TO THAT THAT WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT THAT IS THAT IS ACHIEVABLE AND THAT IS VERIFIABLE THE THAT THE CRITERIA PORTIONS. AS IT RELATES TO THE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN THE CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL IT IT IT DOESN'T LIMON THE TECHNOLOGY THE INVESTMENTS IN IN ANY WAY ALL IT DOES IS SAYING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO GREENWASHING HAPPENING HERE. THAT IS NOT BEING USED AS AN EXCUSE TO CONTINUE TO IN THAT MORE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO CONTINUE TO POLLUTE YOU KNOW OUR OUR AIR AND SO YOU KNOW IT THAT WE'RE WE'RE WORKING HAND IN HAND. WITH THE BOLD CALLS LIKE YOURS TO YOU KNOW A CHEAP CAR NINE ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EVEN EARLIER WELL MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS ACTUALLY T. MOBILE AND VERIFIABLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY ALSO AND I THINK IT'S EXPLICIT IN THE LANGUAGES THAT. IT'S A BACKSTOPS BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT IT'S- IT IS SOON AS IT IS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE RIGHT I THINK THERE'S LANGUAGE IN HERE THAT IS CORRECT OKAY SO NOTES THE NOTES PROVISION BECAUSE THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CONCERN IS IF WE SEE THE SCOPING PLAN COME OUT FOR THIS NEXT ROUND. AND CONTINUES TO SORT OF LAG OR BE ON AMBITIOUS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A NO OVERHANG OF OVERSUPPLY SAY ANY ALLOWANCE MARKET AND LETTING MORE PEOPLE POLLUTE- AND THAT SORT OF TWENTY THIRTY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TRAJECTORY TO ME FEELS LIKE THE INSURANCE POLICY ESPECIALLY FOR THE FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES TO KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO GET DONE. I THINK YOU'VE GOT NOT JUST THE FORTY FIVE LIMIT BUT I THINK BUT I THINK SOME OF THE DIRECT REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS WILL ALSO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT CERTAINTY- AND I REALLY HOPE THAT THE AIRBOARD- HEEDS OUR CALL HERE AND CONTINUES TO SORT OF THINK BG TO PULL UP SHORT- DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND I THINK FOR BOTH OUR FRIENDS IN INDUSTRY AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO INNOVATE AND CREATE JOBS WE GOT TO THINK BIG BECAUSE- WE'RE GOING TO LAG BEHIND IF WE KEEP DOING IT THE OLD WAY AND SAME WITH. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES- SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE AND APPLAUD YOU FOR IT I HOPE THAT THE OPPONENTS ALSO STUDY SOME OF THE PROVISIONS I KNOW THEY'VE YET TO COME IN TO PRINT SO HOPEFULLY BEFORE THE FLOOR THERE THERE'S THAT SORT OF DEPTH OF ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE THE WAY I READ WHAT CAME FROM THAT COMMITTEE. WAS A MUCH MORE- SORT OF- A LESS PRESCRIPTIVE APPROACH AS YOU SAID- ONE THAT GIVES A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO THAT KIND OF EXPERIMENTATION I LOVE THE EMPHASIS ON PERMANENCE I THINK THAT THAT CERTAINTY- IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL AND IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION IN SOME WAY TO PROVIDE ENOUGH LEGAL CERTAINTY AROUND THIS FRAMEWORK WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE COMMITTED TO STORING THE CARBON FOREVER- WHAT IS HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY GUARANTEE FOREVER. AND WHAT KIND OF INSTRUMENTS DO WE NEED A LAW OR IN REGULATION- WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW AN INSURANCE POOL FOR WAYS. TO SORT OF BUILD TRUSTS OR OTHER GUARANTEE TEE'S THERE'S A NUMBER OF MODELS AROUND THE- THAT. AND IF UK'S. AT A MODEL IN THE U. N. HAS A PROPOSAL AND- BUT A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH. LAND RIGHTS AND ESTABLISHING CERTAINTY AROUND- THINGS LIKE. POOR RIGHTS EVEN THE FEROCITY OF SOME OF THESE FORMATIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WERE GONNA INVEST HOPEFULLY BILLIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA TO DO THIS WORK. KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW. THERE'S GOING TO BE VERY HIGH STANDARD ON THIS WORK BUT ALSO THAT. WE LIKE YOU SAID. WE REALLY ARE COMMITTED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN SO I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR BRAVE THAT. PRONOUNCEMENT IN THAT REGARD AND- YEAH MOVES ABILITY APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU OKAY SENT OUT. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS NOT REALLY SO MUCH ON THE BILL PARTLY JUST SOME OBSERVATIONS OF SOMEBODY WHOSE DISTRICT IS BURNING UP RIGHT NOW THIS BILL ISN'T GONNA CHANGE FORCE FIRED ALL- IT MAY MAY REDUCE CARBON. IT GOALS. BUT WE'VE HAD SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE. A 98% REDUCTION IN CARBON BUT THEY PROJECTS DON'T GET FUNDED. SO AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE TOO THAT THE A. R. B. WE JUST APPOINTED A NEW OARD OF THE R. B. BECAUSE THE LAST BOARD- AUDIT CAME OUT WASN'T THAT WELL AND SO GIVING THE POWER TO THE A. R. B. I THINK IS- WITHOUT SOME REALLY CLEAR DIRECTION ON HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT IT IS- AREA. RISKY AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL BE HERE I THINK WE CAME IN TOGETHER IN THE SAME CLASS MAYBE MIGHT BE A COUPLE YEARS LONGER THAN I AM BUT I DID YOU KNOW THAT THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS ON HOW. THESE REGULATORS BECAUSE WE'RE GIVING THEM THE POWER YOU KNOW GET IT DONE AND MY CONFIDENCE IN THEM IS. NOT VERY HIGH AT THIS POINT WE'VE SEEN THE AUDITS COME BACK WERE. THE MONEY THAT WE SPENT THROUGH THE A. R. B. HASN'T REALLY ACHIEVED MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO CARBON REDUCTION AND I JUST WANNA SHARE ONE LAST THING IS. SOMEBODY WHO IS IN BUSINESS AND TRYING TO SURVIVE IN CALIFORNIA HAS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS CONTINUES TO. EXPLODE WE ARE LEADING THE WORLD SUPPOSEDLY IN. TECHNOLOGY AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND TRYING TO TRYING TO SHOW THE WORLD BUT THE WORLD IS NOT. CATCHING UP WITH US AND SO. ALL THE GAINS WE MAKE HERE IF WE DON'T SECURE THOSE JOBS. AND THOSE TECHNOLOGIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA MAKE THEM COMPETITIVE. QUITE FRANKLY THE PRODUCTS THAT WE NEED TO LIVE IN USE WILL JUST BE DEVELOP SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND THE AMOUNT OF CARBON THAT WILL BE LATE RELEASED IN THOSE PROP IN THE IN THOSE TO THE- AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME LAWS WE HAVE. DOES DOES NOTHING FOR. THE CARBON OF THE WORLD WE'REALL BREATHING THE SAME CAR IN THE WORLD SO. THAT'S THE FRUSTRATION FOR ME AS A CALIFORNIAN WHO IS IN BUSINESS HERE TRYING TO. STAY AFLOAT AND IN ORDER TO KEEP MY BUSINESS RUNNING AND PROVIDE THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED WHICH AS YOU KNOW I'M A FARMER PEOPLE HAVE TO EAT EVERY DAY. BUT IF I CAN'T BE COMPETITIVE IN CALIFORNIA. THOSE JOBS ARE GOING TO GO SOME IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE FOOD FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THEY'RE GONNA BE. EMITTING CARBON IS TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE AVAILABLE TODAY WE HAVE TO USE THERE ISN'T. A SILVER BULLET IN THE TECHNOLOGY TO. MAKE MY HARVESTER BE ALL ELECTRIC OR- WELL THIS ISN'T AVAILABLE AND SO WE'RE COMPETING WITH US I JUST WANT TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS WE HAVE A LOT OF BILLS COME THROUGH TODAY THAT I'M GOING TO BE SAYING THE SAME THING ON IT'S LIKE. YEAH WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO GET THERE BUT- I THINK THAT. WE NEED TO. HAVE A MORE CLEAR PLAN WITH THE AIR BOARD THAT IS GOING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO. THE NEEDS OF BEING COMPETITIVE IN CALIFORNIA. MR CHERRY IF I MAKE A THROUGH THE CHAIR- THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR DOLLY I YOU KNOW I. WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF JOBS I MEAN. YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY I HAVE A LOT MORE GRAY HAIR. NOW THAN WHEN WE FIRST STARTED IN TWENTY TWELVE IS- IS BECAUSE OF. YOU KNOW THE CONSTANT- MY CONSTANT CONCERN ARE COUNT CONSTANT CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER WERE DRIVING JOBS OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE DEALS WITH THIS. THIS CHALLENGE OF YOU KNOW HOW DO WE- STOP THE BUSINESS AS USUAL WHEN WE ARE SEEING THESE. DISTURBING AND ALARMING YOU KNOW DEVELOPMENTS IN LA AND YOUR DISTRICT WITH THE WILD FIRES IN THE DROUGHT I MEAN I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS. IN OF ITSELF CERTAINLY IS NOT GOING TO. DIRECTLY YOU KNOW IT IMPACT THE WILD FIRES AND YET. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW LOOK NOT ONLY AT WHAT THE SCIENTISTSARE SAYING BUT WHAT WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD IS TRYING TO DO. AND I THINK THERE IS THE GROWING CONSENSUS THAT WE CANNOT APPROACH- OUR OUR FIGHT AGAINST THE CLIMATE CRISIS IN. BUSINESS AS USUAL. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I MEAN I. AGAIN I WANT TO- YOU KNOW. EMPHASIZE THAT THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT AND INCENTIVIZE IS MUCH OF THE INNOVATION AND THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD ALLOW. BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA- ECONOMICALLY- AS WELL AS IN A WAY THAT'S NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS THE LAST POINT I WANTED TO ADDRESS IS THAT. YOU KNOW EVER SINCE- YOU AND I ARRIVED IN THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY TWELVE. WE HAVE CONSTANTLY HEARD THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS HAS NO OVERSIGHT FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND SO THIS BILL IS TRYING TO PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK THE LEGISLATURE'S FRAMEWORK ON THE A. R. B. TO GUIDE. THE A. R. B. ON HOW TO ACHIEVE THE NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE THE BASIC CRITERIA THE BASIC FRAMEWORK YOU KNOW ON ON HOW TO REGULATE THE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE OF CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL TECHNOLOGIES OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE NEED WE JUST TAKE THE WHOLE PLAN AND DESPERATELY NEEDS TO FIGHT THIS CLIMATE CRISIS. AND SO THIS I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE'S ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW THE OVERSIGHT THE GUIDANCE IN THE FRAMEWORK- AND- TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AN INMATE THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FUJI AND CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEAR PASSION ABOUT THE FIRE- THAT WE ALL SHARE I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY LOOK AT IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AND HOPE THEY'RE BETTER PATHWAYS SIDE TO GETTING THERE YOU SAID WE- WANT THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN AND I'M ALWAYS KIND OF A DISBELIEVE- AT THAT SHOP WE GET INVOLVED WITH CARBS HOW WE SEND THEM THESE. TOOLS WHICH SOMETIMES ARE VERY ELUSIVE AND EXPECT IT JUST TO HAPPEN AND NEVER COMES BACK HERE RIGHT NOW I THINK WE HAVE THE AN AUDIT THAT SAYS THEY AREN'T EVEN CERTAIN ABOUT MEETING THE GOALS AND TWENTY THIRTY HARM BASED ON A SCOPING PLAN THAT STILL IS THE ALL INCLUSIVE IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE PATHWAYS AND I GUESS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS GOING TO BE ON. WHY IT WHY IS THERE AN URGENCY TO MOVE THIS BILL BEFORE THAT PROCESS FOR SB THIRTY TWO IS COMPLETED LET ME THROW ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM. OUR THE MULTITUDE OF OPPOSITION THAT YOU HEARD THERE THERE IS FEAR OBVIOUSLY COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC COMING OUT OF. A RECESSION THAT'S NOT THAT MANY YEARS AGO OUR ECONOMY IS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED- CERTAINLY MOVING TO GREEN JOBS HASN'T BEEN AS- FAVORITE. AS WAS ASSUME SO. I'LL HAVE THE MANY ANALYSIS ALONG THE WAY OF WHAT THESE ARE TARGETS MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY. ARE IS THERE ANY CONSIDERATION FOR THE COST EFFECTIVE ENOUGH THAT THAT SHOULD BE ANALYZE AND- INFER FINALLY ARM I DON'T THINK THERE'D BE THE IF- HUGE. OPPOSITION IF THERE HAD BEEN MORE OUR DISCUSSION NOW WITH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS WHICH I BELIEVE. OCCURRED AT IN THE PREVIOUS- TARGETS THAT WERE SET. WHAT ANY OF THAT. IF ON YOU STILL HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF OPPOSITION SO MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE THEM ALL TOGETHER TALK TO US ABOUT. HOW WE'RE GONNA GET THERE WHEN THE SCOPING PLAN RIGHT NOW STILL ELUSIVE- IS THERE GOING TO BE COST EFFECTIVENESS THAT'S REQUIRED F CARD TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHEN THEY START DOWN THAT PATH AND FRANKLY WOULDN'T WONDERFUL PATHWAY. WHAT ARE THE PATHWAYS WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A REAL IN DEPTH DISCUSSION OF THAT. ARE HOW WE GET AND WHAT TECHNOLOGIES ARE OUT THERE IT'S VERY INTERESTING WHEN YOU SPENT A WEEKEND WATCHING AN INDIVIDUAL GET US TO THE EDGE OF SPACE BECAUSE HE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO DO THAT. AND I DIDN'T GET HUNG UP IN THE BUREAUCRACY AND WHEN WE HAVE THOSE INNOVATORS OUT THERE AND WE- RESTRAIN THEM WITH THE BUREAUCRACY THAT THIS KIND OF STUFF- UP- HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THOSE TECHNOLOGIES IT FOR NOT LETTING. EVERYBODY HAVE A HAVE A FAIR SHOT AT IT AND NOT GOING TO CARVE ON ALL OF THIS SO. THAT'S KIND OF MY- PROBLEM. WITH WHAT THIS PRESENTS OF THE SOLUTION- I THINK IT'S VERY RESTRAINING FRANKLY BUT HAVE AT IT. TALK TO US ABOUT TARA HOW WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW HAVE SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS GOING TO WORK IN THE SHORTER TERM IN THE SHORTER TERM FRANKLY IS TWENTY THIRTY. AND WHAT ARE WE WERE JUST NINE YEARS ON THAT RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU SENATOR SO YOU RISE SEVERAL POINTS AND- I WANT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT ADDRESS ALL OF THEM- GOING GOING BY BACKWARDS- FEFE FROM YOUR LAST POINT I MEAN I WAS WATCHING THIS IS THE SAME- YOU KNOW NEWS ABOUT- SIR BRANSON- USING HIS- IS IT HAS AS WELL UP TO OPEN UP- THAT THIS- THIS NEW EXCITING FRONTIER- THE DOES DOES THE PROSPECT OF COMMERCIAL SPACE TOURISM. AND YOU KNOW- YOU GUYS HAVE THE SAME I HAVE A SIMILAR THOUGHT AS AS AS YOU JUSTICE STATED THAT IDEA YOU KNOW. I WISH THAT- SIR BRANSON WOULD USE HIS- HIS WEALTH AND HIS POWER TO. PURSUE WITHIN THEIR THE BE- AN INVASION THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED TO FIGHT THIS CLIMATE CRISIS. I WOULD TO. I ON ON YOUR POINT OF WORKING WITH OPPOSITION OF A WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO OF MY STAFF HAS BEEN SPENDING COUNTLESS OUR HOURS MEETING WITH DISCUSSING THIS BILL- AND WE HAVE ALL ALONG BEEN COMPLETE. YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN INVITING WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS ON ON HOW TO MAKE THIS BILL WORKABLE FOR EVERYONE FOR NOT ONLY TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS BUT FOR OUR BUSINESSES FOR JOBS I MEAN YOU KNOW FOR ME THERE'S NOTHING THAT GIVES ME MORE GRAY HAIR THAN HAVING TO GO AGAINST THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES AND ALL OF THEIR THEIR MEMBERSHIP YOU KNOW WHO. YOU KNOW WHO I. YOU KNOW I MEAN IN SO MANY WAYS OVER THE YEARS THAT I'VE THAT I'VE TRIED TO SUPPORT. AND YET YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO. WE WE'VE SEEN THIS THIS THIS- THEME CONSTANTLY PLAY OUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW DO WE ACHIEVE. YOU KNOW OUR CLIMATE GOALS HOW DO WE FIGHT THE CLIMATE CRISIS WELL AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW SUPPORT THESE THESE GOOD UNION JOBS THESE THESE THESE THESE BUSINESSES AND OUR STATE. AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A- IT AGAIN IT'S WHAT GIVES ME ALL THIS GRAY HAIR I MEAN IT'S A- SO I WOULD ASK YOU YOU KNOW IF THERE IS. I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING IN THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL THAT WOULD CONSTRAIN. YOU KNOW THE INNOVATION THE INVESTMENTS IN THE INNOVATIONS IF YOU HAVE IN A SPECIFIC UGH- PROPOSAL SPECIFIC PASSAGES THAT YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT I YOU KNOW I THINK I CAN ADDRESS THEM- BUT- YOU KNOW I'D I WOULD DIG. IT CONTINUE TO INVITE ANYONE IN THIS ROOM- ANYONE THAT CALLED AND- ANYONE THAT'S IN OPPOSITION OR HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL YOU KNOW I WILL PERSONALLY WORK DIRECTLY WITH THEM. TO TO ADD TO IT TOO DOES IT TO SEE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH- WITH LANGUAGE TO MAKE THIS BILL WORK FOR ALL OF US BUT THE I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS THE END OF THAT. THAT THE WE CAN'T CONTINUE WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL I MEAN WE ARE WE ARE ON THE FRONT LINES WE ARE THE BOILING FROGS. YOU KNOW AND WE AND WE ARE LITERALLY SEEING AT THIS PAST WEEKEND THE EXTREME HEAT THE WILD FIRES THE DROUGHT SO MEAN I. SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BUT- YOU KNOW. WE CAN'T CONTINUE WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL AND THAT THAT IS WHAT I'M PROPOSING HERE. WELL I THINK YOU AYE I GAVE YOU KIND OF A WHOLE PANOPLY OF. ISSUES THAT CERTAINLY TROUBLED ME I'M JUST WONDERING WHY WE'RE NOT USING ALL THE SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE TO GET THEIR LIKE EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE. AND LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHAT DO YOU ENVISION AS BEING THE TOOLS THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE GOING FORWARD THE USER RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW. AND I GUESS LET ME. EMPHASIZE THERE'S NO URGENCY IF. AND YOU HAVE URGENCY IN THIS BILL. WHAT IS THE URGENCY IF WE DO NOT YET MEET WHAT WE PREDICTED IN OUR WHAT WE ASK FOR AN SB THIRTY TWO. BY TWENTY THIRTY. WE'RE NOT THERE AND WE JUST HAD AN AUDIT THAT SAID IT'S STILL VERY LOOSELY. THEN I THINK THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE TROUBLING FOR US WHO BELIEVE. AND SEE IT HAPPENING I LIVE ON THE COAST ICC RISE I SEE PEOPLE HAVING TO PUT ANOTHER WALL. ANOTHER I THINK OF AN INCH AND A HALF EIGHTEEN INCHES ON THE FRONT OF THEIR- THEIR BOAT AREAS IN NEWPORT BEACH BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING SWAMPED ARE WHEN WE GET THE KING TIDES IT'S HAPPENING. BUT WHEN WE COME UP WITH THINGS THAT. YOU KNOW LARGEST THEY'RE THEY'RE GREAT SOUNDING THEIR GREAT WORDS BUT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING OUT LIKE MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FRIEND BIEBER HERE. AND HE'S SAYING THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE. ARE ARE NOT APPROVED OF THE WAY TO SEQUESTER CARBON. SO WE CAN'T JUST KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT AND ALEC NOREEN I DON'T THINK THE THINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE. THEY SHOULD GET SOME SORT OF STANDARD. ON THE ON THE CONTINUUM OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE WE DON'T HAVE A CONTINUUM WE'RE JUST SAYING DO IT. IN THAT GET PUT IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THAT CAN BE EXTREMELY EXTREMELY. ARE RESTRAINING ON IDEAS AND IMMEDIATELY HURT. OUR BUSINESS AND JOB CREATION. IN THAT HAVE TO BE AN EQUATION WHERE THERE'S BALANCE ON BOTH SIDES OR WILL SAVE A PLANET- FOR SOMEONE BUT THE PEOPLE. WHO REALLY NEED TO LIVE HERE THE ANIMALS ON THE- FLOOR AND THE FUN AND THE PEOPLE THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING FOR THEM BECAUSE REMEMBER. YOU CAN'T SUPPORT ALL OF THESE THINGS UNLESS YOU'VE GOT A REVENUE STREAM AND WE ARE KILLING THE REVENUE STREAM AS WE GO ALONG AND THAT TROUBLES ME I'VE SEEN IT AND I COMMUNITIES. AND I LIVE IN ENOUGH AFFLUENT COMMUNITY. SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY ACCOUNT SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT- I DO- YOU KNOW CHALLENGE YOU. I PLEDGE YOU AND CHALLENGE YOU IF YOU WANT TO BE THE LEAD ON THIS. COME UP WITH. SOME THINGS THAT ARE MORE TANGIBLE. REASONABLE AND YOU KNOW REAL TIME. BECAUSE THE DO NOT. SEEM TO BE IN THE IN THE CONFIDANT MOVING THE TARGET FORWARD. PUTTING HUGE GOALS ON THERE BUT SAY DO IT AND HOLD OVER ON THIS SIDE OF THE EQUATION THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE GOING TO SAVE US. THE VIOLENCE SEEN IT YET. WHAT WHEN WE GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THOSE. ISSUES IN YOUR CLOTHES- YEAH THAT'S FINE. YEAH THE TOP. GO FOR IT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR YOUR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS YOUR CONCERNS- GOING GO BACK TO CENTER BATES IS- CONCERNS AYE AYE I WANNA MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THAT THIS BILL IS NOT TO REPLACE ANY OF THE- GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS AND SB THIRTY TWO THAT- THAT LAYS OUT THE THAT THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGETS AND EFFECTIVE THAT IS ONE OF THE- THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. TO CLARIFY THAT THE NEW TWENTY FORTY FIVE CLIMB MICHAEL SHALL NOT TAKE PRECEDENT OR SUPERSEDE MUSIC THE EXISTING TWENTY THIRTY GHG REDUCTION TARGETS THIS IS THIS THIS IS THE NEXT STEP IS THAT WE STARTED WITH WITH THE AB THIRTY TWO- WE REACH THOSE GOALS- IN AN ADVANCE OF THE SCHEDULE- THERE WE THEN- A PAST SEVEN. SB THIRTY TWO. THE FIRST IS AB THIRTY TWO THE SECOND WAS SB THIRTY TWO WHICH WHICH SET THE NEW GOALS FOR TWENTY THIRTY YOU KNOW THE AUDIT IT DID SHOW THAT TO. THAT THE IT IS YOU KNOW WE DO WE DO HAVE OUR CHALLENGES AND THAT WE DO NEED TO. EXERCISE MORE OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS DOING WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AT HAD MANDATE IT TO DO- UNDER SB THIRTY TWO. BUT THIS IS THE NEXT STEP THIS IS LOOKING BEYOND LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY LIKE PRESIDENT BIDEN LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD IS DOING IS WHAT ARE WE DOING IF WE DON'T GET TO. CARBON NEUTRALITY BY MID CENTURY WE- YOU KNOW. WE HAVE NO FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND THEREAFTER- AS AS AS AS WE KNOW IT WE YOU KNOW WE WILL IRREVERSIBLY CHANGE- OUR PLANET AND OUR CLIMATE- I AT THAT POINT AND SO. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IN NO WAY- YOU KNOW SEEKS TO UNDERMINE OR SUPERSEDE OR REPLACE- YOU'D BE SB THIRTY TO TWENTY THIRTY GOALS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HOLD THEIR PEACE FEET TO HIS. TO THE FIRE TO- HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE BUT THIS IS BEYOND THAT- AND- THE BLASTED IT YOU KNOW AGE ADJUSTED CLOSE I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL ALL OF THE OPPOSITION- ESPECIALLY ON THE JOBS QUESTION I MEAN THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT IT THAT- THIS ENTIRE LEGISLATURES FACING IN TERMS OF. ITS OF. PURSUING IT SAID AS ITS CLIMATE GOALS- BUT LET ME JUST WRAP UP BY SAYING THAT- THAT- WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT ALONE IN THIS EFFORT I MEAN- OTHER STATES THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. JUST PASSED A LAW THAT CALLS FOR A BY TWENTY FIVE OF FIFTY AND SO. IT YOU KNOW THE STATE OF WASHINGTON PASSED THE LAW IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS LAST YEAR- A PASS A LAW TO ACHIEVE CARBON- TWO EIGHT NINE ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- EMISSIONS- BY TWENTY FIFTY. SO I MEAN. WE ARE JUST TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD IN RECOGNIZING AND LISTENING TO THE SCIENTISTS THAT IF WE DON'T ACHIEVE NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY MID CENTURY. WE ARE NOT DOING A SERVICE FOR ITS CHILDREN GRANTS AND GRANDCHILDREN SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I THOUGHT. THANK YOU I MEAN IT THE CHALLENGE IS IT'S- REALLY FOR. OUR GRANDCHILDREN ARE GREAT GRANDCHILDREN I MEAN IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT ISSUES THAT WE HAVE HERE THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE CAN SEE. AND YET- YOU KNOW. YOUR THROUGH THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSES THE REAL IMPACTS THE DESERVED. REAL LIFE CHANGING IMPACTS AND OUR LIVES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE AS YOU SAY THAT THE BOILING WATER- THE FROG ANALOGY BUT- THE- BUT- IT'S NOT A PLEASANT TOPIC BUT IT WHEN YOU REALLY START TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE FORECASTS IT'S VERY UNPLEASANT- BUT BUT- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT- MOST OF US ARE NOT GOING TO BE AROUND- AND THAT'S ONE REASON WHY THIS SUCH A DIFFICULT ISSUE TO TAKE COLLECTIVE ACTION ON AND- AND- AND THE COLLECTIVE ACTION ISSUE ISRAEL I WAS HAVING A LITTLE SIDE BAR WITH. OUR COLLEAGUE ON AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT GOOD IS ALL THIS IS CALIFORNIA'S ONLY ONE DOING THIS KIND OF WORK. COURSE ARE A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS DOING WORK IN THE SPACE- BUT IT'S JUST SUCH AN A SUCH AN EXTENSION CRISIS. AND. SO I'M I'M REALLY SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I ACTUALLY HOPE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WE FIND WAYS TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE MANY ISSUES WE CERTAINLY ADDRESSED THIS NUMBER OF INDUSTRY ISSUES IN THE AMENDMENTS- IN A WAY THAT I THINK STILL KEEP YOUR BILL STRONG- BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT I THINK OF AN EXPRESSED TODAY BY OPPOSITION I CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE YOU AND HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS FROM. LABOR AND INDUSTRY AND OTHERS- TO SEE SEE WHAT WE CAN. HOW MUCH PROGRESS WE CAN MAKE ON THIS BILL- IF THE BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD- BUT I DO APPLAUD YOUR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS- TRULY EXISTENTIAL ISSUE FOR OUR- OUR- OUR SPECIES ARE PLANET. AND THE BILL'S AND MOVED BY SENATOR CASKEY AT. CONCERT WITH CHOLERA. I AM NUMBER ONE AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MERIT CG THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALLEN HI ALAN I BATES. DALLY. YES SKINNER STERN Y. CASKEY HI ASKI I'D. OKAY WELL THAT OPEN FOR THE FOLKS THAT ON AND- LOOK FOR TO THAT NEGOTIATION DISCUSSION CONTINUING- WITH. ONE TO TASHA BOERNER HORVATH BILL THIS IS SEN. AB. ONE SEVENTEEN. WE NEED YOU CAN PRESENTED AFTER TEN SO WE MADE SURE THAT THIS IS A LONG MEDIA BILL. BEFORE YOU- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR- PRESENTATION ON THIS BILL ON ELECTRIC BICYCLES. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SURE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR FLEXIBILITY ALSO WITH THE SCHEDULING TODAY TODAY I AM PRESENTING AB ONE SEVENTEEN A BILL TO ALLOW T. BY CONSENT IS TO BE ONE OF THE PRIORITIES ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING UNDER THE AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. BY INCREASING E. BIKE ADOPTION WE ARE ABLE TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED A RECENT STUDY OF NORTH AMERICAN E. BIKE OR SHOWS THAT NEARLY HALF OR 46% OF E. BIKE COMMUTE TRIPS REPLACED AUTOMOBILE COMMUTERS AND I CAN ATTEST THAT A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. THIS WEEKEND WE TOOK ALMOST ALL OF OUR TRIPS AROUND TOWN ON OUR E. BIKES AND NOT OUR CARS TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS WE MUST WORK TO REDUCE THESE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND REPLACE THEM WITH CLEANER ALTERNATIVES HE BY COULD OPTION HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST YEAR BUT COSTS REMAIN A FACTOR AND AVAILABILITY FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS. AS I NOTED IN PRIOR COMMITTEES- I AM WORKING ON AMENDMENTS THAT WILL ENSURE THE PROGRAM PRIORITIZES LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS INCLUDING THOSE AT INCLUDING THE USE OF A SALARY CAP SO THESE INCENTIVES GET TO THOSE WHO ACTUALLY NEED THE HELP. THEY MEMBERS WOULD ALSO STRUCTURE THIS AS A VOUCHER PROGRAM FOR ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE PRE APPROVED FOR INCENTIVES AND WALK INTO A PARTICIPATING RETAILER TO PURCHASE AN EVIL BIKE USING THE VOUCHER. FINALLY OUR POINT PLAN AMENDMENTS WILL HELP ENSURE INCENTIVES CAN BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF QUALITY E. BIKE MODELS THAT A SMALL PORTION OF THE FUNDING ALLOCATED TO THIS PROGRAM WILL GO TO E. BIKE EDUCATION I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE A LOT OF E. BIKES IN TOWN WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO SEND YOU BACK EDUCATION WITH THEM. SAFETY PROGRAMS AND PROGRAM PROMOTION ENSURE APPROPRIATE REGULATIONS TO PREVENT. FRAUD AND ABUSE OF THE PROGRAM. CENTERS AB ONE SEVENTY MAKE A- MORE. FOR CAL. ALONG MORE PEOPLE TO ADOPT THIS CLEANER HOW. FORM TRANSPORT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ARE WITNESSES COULDN'T MAKE IT THIS MORNING SO. WE GO STRAIGHT.

WARNING MEMBERS DON'T GET ALONG WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE SEVENTEEN I'M A REGULAR T. BIKE USER BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE THESE EXCELLENT VEHICLES AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE ACCESS TO THEM AND THEY DO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND REDUCE THE EMISSIONS THAT ARE CAUSING BOTH AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE.

AB ONE ONE SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN THERE ARE NOW. AND AT THIS TIME IF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE TO YOU OKAY ALL RIGHT WILL BRING THE BILL BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- CENTER CASKEY. I HEARD YOU WHEN YOU PRESENT A BILL THAT YOU'VE- INDICATED THAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA BY THE C. BIKES AND THEY'RE GONNA GET OUT OF THEIR CARS AND DRIVE AROUND TOWN AND YOU. DRIVE AROUND TOWN AND I. APSLEY GREETED THE VOUCHERS AND HAVING THIS. AVAILABLE WITH THE EQUIP WILL MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE BUT- THE STAFF REPORT INDICATES AT LEAST. IN EUROPE TO SIX X. EXHAUSTIVE STUDIES THEY CAME UP TO SAY REALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU GET PEOPLE WHO ARE REGULAR BICYCLE RIDERS. SWITCH THE BIG MOVEMENT IS THE BICYCLE RIDERS SWITCHING TO E. BIKES THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF PEOPLE GETTING OUT OF THEIR CARS. AND- DOING ANY PART I GUESS IS THERE'S TWO STUDIES. I DIDN'T I MISS WERE YOU. IT I GUESS THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAD THAT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS- WATERFALL OF PEOPLE MY ANY BIKES WITH THIS LEGISLATION SO FAR COULD SENATOR I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS WHO CAN AFFORD THEM AND I THINK IN EUROPE AS SOMEBODY WHO LIVED IN EUROPE FOR TWELVE YEARS AND RODE MY BIKE EVERYWHERE BY COMMUTED- MANY PLACES IN EUROPE ARE VERY FLAT WHERE I LIVED- IT WAS EASY TO RIDE MY BIKE. EVERY DAY MANY PLACES IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT FLAT SO MY TOWN FOR EXAMPLE IS A LOT OF BIG HILLS. TO GO TO AND THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITIVE FOR A LOT OF RECREATIONAL USERS TO USE A REGULAR BICYCLE. AND WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS YOU'LL SEE ADOPTION OF A WIDER RANGE. IN CALIFORNIA OF THOSE WHO ADOPTING EVEN MAKES- FIRST OF ALL AND SECOND OF ALL- I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN EUROPE VERSUS A CALIFORNIA. FOR BIKES IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT SO I'M NOT SURE EUROPEAN STUDY COULD REALLY IS REALLY ACCURATE FOR DESCRIBING CALIFORNIA HAS NOT BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AS A CYCLIST. THEY ARE EQUIVALENT ME AND I KNOW LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MYSELF IF I USED TO BUY COMMUTE. AND SO I WHEN WE MOVED BACK HERE FROM GERMANY I GOT A TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR HE JODY BIKE. AND THAT REPLACE THE CAR WITH HIM BY A SECOND CAR. AND I BY COMMUNITY GO SEVEN MILES MEDICAL DOES GIANT HELL. AND I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT HAD I NOT HAD AN E. BIKE. NOW I CAN AFFORD IT SO I'M NOT THE TARGET OF THIS BILL THERE ARE MANY CALIFORNIANS THOUGH WHO NEED THAT AND CENTER VOUCHER. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO- ACTUALLY ADOPT IT AND AS I SAID THIS WEEKEND WE WENT TO THE BEACH ONCE AND WE DIDN'T TAKE A CAR. WE WENT TO THE STORE TO PICK UP MY MEN'S BECAUSE WE WERE DOING MY MANDATE- AND WE DON'T USE A CAR. SO THE STUDY THAT WE'RE CITING SHOWS 43% OF E. BIKE OWNERS REPLACE CAR TRIPS WITH BIKE TRIPS AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF EMISSIONS REDUCTION. THAT WE WANT TO SEE WITH THIS PROGRAM. AND WE WANT TO SEE IT. ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS PRESSURE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. WELL I'M GOOD I'M ALL MOVED A BILL I'M JUST SAYING THAT YOU HAVE A STEADY THERE'S OTHER TO OTHER STUDIES THERE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF INTO TOTAL INFORMATION AND I THINK OF JIM BELL WE'RE SITTING UP HERE. HE WOULD SAY THE AMOUNT OF GREEN PAINT THAT'S BEING SPENT BY CITIES AND COUNTIES TO PUT BY CLINGS AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. FOR SB ONE IS. FOR IS CHANGING THE LAND. I MEAN YOU GO A LOT OF US. RIGHT WHAT WE MAY NOT. ALL IN WE DO HAVE A LOT OF BIKE LANES ARE BEING PUT RIGHT NOW I THINK THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY AT LEAST IN THE BAY AREA WHERE I'VE GONE RUNNING SO ALL USE IT- EIGHT ATTENTION I HOPE IT'S- WILDLY SUCCESSFUL BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT THE INFORMATION THEY'RE SAYING IS. IT IS SHOWING IS THAT YES FOR THE WEEKEND WE MIGHT NOT DO IT BUT FOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE HI I AM I AM. I JUST BRING IT UP BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ORDINARILY THEY'RE ALREADY RIDING BIKES AND THEY GO TO GO TO THE E. BIKE WHICH IS THE BIG SHIFT WHICH- MIGHT BE A GOOD THING YOU KNOW HE LESS SWEATY WHEN YOU SHOP AT WORK WELL AND I WAS THAT'S WHAT IT DOES TO BE HONEST LIKE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU MIGHT WORKED. I WOULD QUESTION THE USING STUDIES FROM EUROPE THAT HAS A VERY DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE HAS A DIFFERENT TRANSIT LANDSCAPE THEN WE HAVE MAYBE THE BAY AREA APPROXIMATES IT MORE THAN THAT IN MY AREA OF NORTH COUNTY SAN DIEGO- ABOUT I HEAR IT I HEAR YOUR POINT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT. BUT I DO THINK THIS BILL IS ABOUT MAKING IT A YOU KNOW MAKING E. BIKES ACCESSIBLE AND REPLACING CAR TRIPS AND I WOULD SAY MOST OF EUROPE IS NOT DEPENDENT ON A CAR IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA ARE. SO. REPLACING THOSE TRIPS I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. YES HI- ARGUMENTS FOR A BILL THAT I TEST IS TAKING IF YOU'RE GETTING. OFF OF A BICYCLE ON A BIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY IMPACTING THE ENVIRONMENT MORE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO CHARGE E. BIKE SOMEWHERE. BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID THE GOAL IS TO. ICE ICE I SEE PEOPLE USING THIS FOR SHORT RUNS AND NOT NOT USING AN AUDIBLE BILL. IT'S EASIER TO PARK EASIER TO GET WHERE YOU WANT TO GO SO- AND I AND ALSO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNES WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO. PURCHASE SEVERAL OF THE- ELECTRIC CAR WOULD PREFERRED TO GET. A BIKE THAT THEY CAN GET AROUND ON WHICH IS GONNA BE BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND BETTER FOR THE POCKETBOOK AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN INCENTIVIZE THAT SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING A BILL TODAY THANK YOU.

I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SUMMARIZED ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS. AND I WANT TO THANK RILEY FOR HER WORK ON THIS BILL. AB FIVE EIGHTY FIVE COURT DATE STATE EFFORTS TO HELP URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES COMBAT EXTREME HEAT. BY CREATING THE EXTREME HEAT AND COMMUNITY ROOM RESILIENCE PROGRAM UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. THE PROGRAM ESTABLISHES GUIDELINES FOR COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS AND HELPS LOCAL ENTITIES IMPLEMENT MEASURES THAT REDUCE EXTREME HATE. THE FIVE HOTTEST YEARS ON RECORD AND IN ORDER OUR FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THESE RECORD BREAKING HEAT WAVES HAVE LED TO MORE POWER OUTAGES COMPROMISED WATER QUALITY INCREASES IN POLLUTION AND MORE INTENSE WILDFIRES. JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST EXPERIENCE AN UNPRECEDENTED SEVERE HEAT STORM LIKE NEVER BEFORE UNFORTUNATELY RESULTING IN AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DEATHS ALTHOUGH WE CAN ESTIMATE. THE TRUE NUMBER TO BE HIGHER BECAUSE MANY DEATHS GO ON REPORTED. THIS PAST WEEK IN CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN EXPERIENCE THE SCORCHING HOT EXTREME WEATHER EVENT. HI MY CHANGES INCREASING THE FREQUENCY SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THESE HEAT WAVES EXTREME HEAT IS A TRUE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS RESULTING IN MORE DEATHS EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND IS ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING FOR OLDER ADULTS AND THOSE WITH UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS. RECENT RESEARCH ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SUICIDE RATES AND OTHER FORMS OF VIOLENCE INCREASED DURING EXTREME HEAT EVENTS. AS A REPRESENTATIVE TO A LARGELY DISADVANTAGED LATINO COMMUNITY THERE ARE MORE THAN JUST CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES THEY'RE ALSO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES AREAS THAT EXPERIENCE EXTREME HEAT. OFTEN HAVE LARGE EXPANSES OF CONCRETE LESS GREENERY HIGHER DENSITY HOUSING LOWER AVERAGE INCOMES AND POOR HEALTH STATUS SENATORS DEATH COULD BE PROVIDE DEATHS COULD BE PREVENTED IF WE WERE TO INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO MITIGATE THIS EXTREME HATE. CONTINUED IN ACTION WILL INCREASE HARDSHIPS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING DUE TO THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. AB FIVE EIGHTY FIVE WILL BRING EQUITY TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES AND GIVE THEM A FIGHTING CHANCE TO BEAT THE HEAT. I'M COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE AND HAVE SUBMITTED A BUDGET REQUEST OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. AND I'M WORKING CLOSELY WITH LEADERSHIP ON THAT REQUEST. TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF THE SPELL I HAVE ANDY GET WORKED UP POLICY AND OUTREACH CONSULTANT FROM CLIMATE RESOLVE.

CAPTION MONIQUE BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN COMBINED CARE REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH IF I BEGIN I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY FIVE EXTREME HEAT AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE PROGRAM. OUR STATE IS GETTING HOTTER AND IMPACTING OUR HEALTH RIGHT NOW THEY HAD MY NUMBER SIXTEEN RELATED FATALITIES WHICH SURPASSED ALL OTHER NATURAL WEATHER EVENTS. HAIL IN COMPARISON TO THE FULL IMPACT OF INCREASED HEAT WHICH IS GROSSLY UNDER REPORTED. THAT'S DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO EAT WE ARE USUALLY COVERED BY SPECIFIC VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. MOST AT RISK ARE ELDERLY LIVING ALONE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPROMISED BY CHRONIC ILLNESS INCLUDING MENTAL ILLNESS. LESS WORK OUTDOORS EVEN ENDORSEMENT INADEQUATE COOLING AND HISTORICALLY MORE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER ANALYSIS OF LARGER DATASETS HELLO MORE WORRISOME STORY CAN ONLY INCREASE ACROSS THE BOARD AND THE TEMPERATURE RIGHT THAT OVERALL MORTALITY INCREASE IN THERE ARE MORE DEATHS OR CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH THE CARD WHAT HEART ATTACKS OR STROKES NUMBER ONE AND THREE KILLERS IN THE WESTERN WORLD. MORE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS JUMP SURELY BASED ON THE TEMPERATURE AND MORE OZONE A PREDOMINANT MODEL YEAR CHEN IS PRODUCED AT A HIGHER RATE AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES POOR INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY MORE PEOPLE SHOOT AND STAB EACH OTHER THE HIGHER SEVERITY OF INJURIES WHEN IT IS HOT OUTSIDE. THE STUDIES MAKE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT WE MUST DO SOMETHING. ABOUT THIS MELTING HEALTH CRISIS. CAN WE DO. WE NEED TO PREVENT X. TO AMBIENT ARE TAKE FOR LONG OF TIME I COOLING ARE. CALLED GROUP SHOULD TREAT PROBABLY BILLION THAT CAN COOL AREAS COOLER BUILT IN FOR WITH REFLECTIVE GROUP GROUPS AND OTHER MULTI BENEFIT PROJECT ARE ALL EXAMPLES HOW GOVERNMENT CAN INCENTIVISE PREVENTION EXCESSIVE HEAT EXPOSURE. WE CAN PREVENT HARM BY DISSEMINATING CENTRALIZED IN CONSISTENT MESSAGE ABOUT EXTREME HEAT. AND HELP PEOPLE TO TAKE ACTION TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE THE IMPACT INCLUDING PERSONAL PREPARATION AND KNOWING HOW TO ACCESS PUBLIC RESOURCES. EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY FIVE WOULD ACCOMPLISH THIS BY COORDINATING THE ACTIVITIES OF OVER A THOUSAND STATE AGENCIES. EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY FIVE OKAY SINCE THE STATE EFFORTS TO GETTING THE IMPACT OF DEADLY HEAT WAVES I CAN'T THINK RECORDING COORDINATION AND EFFECTIVENESS IN OUR PREVENTION AND MITIGATION RESPONSE IT.

BOB DYLAN CASKEY YEAH I'M- I'M ON PAGE TEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS I THINK THE FOURTH THE THIRD BULLET. IN THE FIRST BOLD PARAGRAPH ABOUT SEEKING TO MINIMIZE THE STRESS ON THE ELECTRICAL GRID IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE'S SOME. CHANGES THAT CAN BE MADE TO CREATE A COOLER ENVIRONMENT THAT DON'T. REQUIRE A GIGANTIC AC SYSTEMS OF THIS MONTH SO THAT'S GOOD AND SOME OF THAT WOULD LEAD ME TO THE NEXT POINT IS THAT. I APPLIED YOUR ENTHUSIASM FOR SEEKING A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET AUGMENTATION. JUST SO WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE THE SENATE WHILE EARLY WILDFIRE PROPOSAL HAD FIFTY MILLION FOR OPR TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ANTICIPATING IN THIS. N. UNFORTUNATELY THE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR DID NOT SEE THE SAME WAY AS HE AS WE DID ON THESE COOLING CENTERS IN THE EMERGENCY- RETROFIT OF AREAS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING. EXTREME HEAT I HOPE THAT THE ENTHUSIASM THAT SOME PEOPLE SHOWN FOR THIS BILL WILL TRANSFER OVER TO LEADERSHIP. AND THAT THAT THERE WILL BE A BETTER DISCUSSION WITH EARLY WILDFIRE ACTION OUR CLIMATE RESILIENCY. ACTIONS THAT THAT SENATE HAS ARTICULATED COOLING CENTERS ON BUT IS ON. HAS BEEN UNABLE TO GET A THREE WAY DEAL. FOCUSING IN ON THE THIRD BULLET ON THE SECOND PORTION IS THAT HE- COMMUNITY RESILIENCY CENTERS THAT ARE CONSTRUCTED AND RETROFITTED. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD AT LEAST ON THE BUDGET SIDE HERE ON OUR COUNTY FAIRS COUNTY COMMUNITY CENTERS HAVING THEM YOU BE USE N. AMERICANS WHO WERE CENTERS AND ALL THAT DO YOU. ANTICIPATE THAT SOME OF THE- ACTION WITH YOUR BILL WOULD BE GOING THERE. AS OPPOSED TO WEAR AND MORE URBAN ENVIRONMENT THAT WOULD HAVE TO DO- COOLING CENTERS AT CONVENTION CENTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. OKAY YOU KNOW THE TH- THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DECIDE THAT YOU KNOW IT IT. THIS BILL BENEFITS BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES- AND WE WANT THEM TO PLANNED FOR EXTREME HEAT EVENTS- AND BE ABLE TO USE OF THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE- IN ADDITION WITH WHAT WE WOULD BE PROVIDING OF COURSE FINANCIAL RESOURCES- TO MAKE THAT PLAN HAPPEN IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. AND IN THE CONSULTATION THAT OPR IS GOING TO BE DEALING WITH- ACADEMIC AND TECHNICAL EXPERTS THAT INCLUDES ACTUALLY INDIVIDUALS THAT SERVE ON THE AYE CARP WHO MAYBE. ACTUALLY THE F. THE EXPERT IN THAT FIELD YES OKAY GOOD I'M OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. GREAT HOW SOMEONE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS I THINK AND I'M VERY PLEASED ABOUT THIS BILL AND THEIR CONTENTS SOME REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES WITH REGARDS TO. EXTREME HEAT WHICH IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS. THIS OBSERVE THE PROBLEMATIC PORTION OF THIS PROBLEM THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. BUT THE GUARDS TO- CLIMATE CHANGE SO. I'M TO MOVE BY SUMMER CASKEY AS CENTER GONZALEZ. I TO WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD SHE DOES HAVE TO SEE REVISED SEEM TO HAVE REALLY GOOD MOMENTUM ON THIS AND THE- I'M AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN OUTLINED TO ADDRESS A LOT OF WHAT AS A SENATOR A CASKET MENTION- OF WHAT THE SENATE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF. ADDRESSING THIS VERY ISSUE OF EXTREME HEAT AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND SPECIFICALLY I HAD A QUESTION AS WELL WHICH I THINK WAS- CLARIFIED ON THE THIRD BULLET AND THE NUMBER FOUR SPECIFIED THAT COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED A RESPIRATORY FITTED. TO SERVE THE PUBLIC DURING EXTREME HEAT EVENTS- AND I'LL TELL YOU I MEAN BEING IN LOS ANGELES AS WE KNOW SENIORS LIVING IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS ALL BY THEMSELVES NOT HAVING AND ANY REPRIEVE FROM THE HEAT AND THE WORD LITERALLY IN THE THICK OF IT RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND STAND READY TO HELP IN ANYWAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YEAH. YEAH WE'RE JUST SIDE BARRING ABOUT HOW THIS COMMITTEE ACTUALLY HELD HEARINGS ON THIS VERY TOPIC- ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND IT'S A SIGN OF PROGRESS THAT WE'VE- THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. GET PEOPLE FOCUSED MEANS AND GET THE SORT OF CONSENSUS BEHIND YOUR BILL AND SOME OF THESE OTHER EFFORTS THAT I CARP. SO BOTH THE SENATE PROGRESS AND ALSO I THINK IT IS A SIGN OF HOW MUCH PEOPLE STERN AT. BECOME MORE MORE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF PROGRESS ON. I SUPPOSE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT BOTH WAYS BUT- THE BILL'S REMOVED HI WHAT'S THAT YOU CLOSE. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO THANK ALL THE SENATORS FOR YOUR COMMENTS- YOUR INTEREST AND FOR THIS DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI- YOU'VE BEEN LEADING IN THIS AREA THROUGH THE BUDGET THROUGH YOUR ROLE AS BUDGET SUB CHAIR- I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU CALIFORNIA'S GRATEFUL TO YOU- THIS BILL IS VERY TIMELY YOU KNOW WE JUST. WE'RE GOING EVERY WEEKEND IS A HEAT WAVE- WERE WARNING OUR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT EXTREME HEAT EVERY DAY EARLIER AND EARLIER EVERY YEAR IT'S NO LONGER AN AUGUST EVENT WE YOU KNOW WE STARTED IN JUNE- IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE AND CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE PREPARED AND SHOULD BE LEADING- IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PREPARED AND WERE- PROVIDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO MITIGATE EXTREME HATE. SO THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE BREAKS. CONTROL THE CORAL. I ITEM NUMBER THREE AB FIVE EIGHT FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE BATES. DALLY GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I SKINNER STERN BY CASTING HI. OKAY THIS THREE. OKAY LET'S LET'S LOW HOLDER OPEN FOR THE FOLKS AT ON BUT WE SHOULD PROCEED YOU PROJECT YOUR BILL. OKAY WE'RE HERE NEXT FROM AUTUMN BURKE WHO'S HERE TO PRESENT A. B. SIX EIGHTY ITEM NUMBER FOUR IN YOUR CHEN IS MEMBERS. GOOD MORNING SHARE AND SENATORS. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A GLOBAL LEADER IN COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE OUR STATE HAS LED THE WAY AN AGGRESSIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS ONCE BEATING ARK ECONOMY TO BE THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD. ALTHOUGH THERE'S BEEN GREAT PROGRESS THERE IS MORE AND MORE EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT OUR INVESTMENTS TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE ARE NOT GOING TO COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONE I REPRESENT WHERE THE FUNDING IS MOST NEEDED. A JUNE TWENTY TWENTY REPORT AUTHORED BY THE STAFF FROM THE UCLA CENTER FIRST ASSISTING ABILITY COMMUNITIES FOUND THAT. THE STRUCTURE OF OUR CLIMATE INVESTMENT IS SKEWED TO BENEFIT THE MOST AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE. THIS HAS COME AT THE EXPENSE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ABILITY AND RESOURCES TO ACCESS EXISTING PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVES. VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE BEING LEFT BY THE WAYSIDE AS OUR STATE ADDRESSES CLIMATE CHANGE. SB SIX EIGHTY HELPS BRIDGE THIS GAP BY IMPLEMENTING KEY POLICIES RECOMMENDED IN THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S RECENT REPORT. PUTTING CALIFORNIA ON THE HIGH ROAD A JOBS AND CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOR TWENTY THIRTY. AB SIXTY WOULD REQUIRE GIGI R. F. APPLICANTS TO USE FAIR AND REASONABLE EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS TO PROMOTE HIGH QUALITY JOBS. INCLUDES A PROCUREMENT POLICIES TO MAKE SURE APPLICANTS ARE CONTRACTING WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE ENTITIES AND PREVAILING WAGE FOR CONSTRUCTION JOBS. NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE GDR OF BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME WHO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WOULD SOMEHOW TAKE AWAY FROM THE PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS BY ADDING REQUIREMENTS THAT ENSURE THAT WORKERS WHO BRING GIGI ARE. PROJECTS TO FRUITION ARE PAID WAGES AND PROVIDE BENEFITS THAT CREATE A PATHWAY TO A CAREER. NOT A JOB. WHAT IS A PRIMARY PURPOSE WELL IT'S PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AB THIRTY TWO ALSO MADE CLEAR. THAT CLIMATE INVESTMENT SHOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. OUR LEGISLATION HAVE BEEN PASSED IN THE FURTHERANCE OF THIS AB FIFTEEN THIRTY TWO FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE REQUIRE THE G. G. R. PROGRAMS MAXIMIZE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. AND COOK DIRECT INVESTMENTS TOWARDS THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE. IN ADDITION SB FIVE THIRTY FIVE IN THE SAME YEAR ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK TO DIRECT EACH YEAR IF INVESTMENTS AS THEIR ASSOCIATED BENEFITS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THAT BILL PROVIDED THE FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTMENTS THAT CAN MEET MULTIPLE POLICY OBJECTIVES. ENHANCE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I CAN THINK OF NO GREATER ECONOMIC BENEFIT THAN A CAREER AT LEAST WAS STABLE AND HOPEFULLY MIDDLE CLASS LIFE. I SAT DOWN WITH THE CHAIR LAST WEEK AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME MISTER CHAIR. TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHERE ARE THE JOBS REPORT CAME FROM AND WHY I HAD PUSHED SO HARD FOR BOTH AND THREE FIFTY AND AS A RESULT IN CAP AND TRADE. I HAD AN EXPERIENCE WHERE I WAS WITH US FOR A SENATOR FROM I THINK IT WAS NORTH CAROLINA'S NAMED CENTER CARTER. AND HE HAD HIS DISTRICT HAD COAL. AND WHEN THEY TOOK AWAY HIS THE KANEMI AND HIS COMMUNITY WENT DOWN AND HE ENDED UP HAVING THE HIGHEST. UNEMPLOYMENT RATES THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS SEEN. AND HE WAS ALMOST IN TEARS. HE WAS BAKING ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT L. ENGINE UNDER UNDER ENERGY INDUSTRIES. WHAT WILL MY PEOPLE DO. WHAT JOB CAN I GET THEM HOW DO I TRANSFER THEIR SKILLS FROM WHERE THEY ARE NOW INTO THE CLEAN A CONNIE. AND THIS GROWN MAN WAS BEGGING. FOR A FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT HIS PEOPLE TO WORK. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A DISTRICT THAT IS DIRECTLY THAT I HAVE REFINERY IN MY DISTRICT. MAKING SURE THAT MY COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO THRIVE AS WE TRAIN AS WE TRANSFER FROM A DIRTY ECONOMY TO CLEAN ECONOMY. HAS BEEN MY PRIORITY SINCE I HAVE GOTTEN HERE. SO THIS BILL. SO THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL CAME FROM THAT'S WHERE THE REPORT CAME FROM AND THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL CAME FROM. THIS BILL WOULD FURTHER PRIORITIZE APPLICANTS THAT PARTNER WITH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT TARGET RESIDENTS UNDER IN UNDER RESOURCE TRIBAL AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN THE SAME REGION AS THE PROJECT. THESE PROVISIONS WHICH ARE JUST A FEW OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS PROPOSED BY THE CW DP'S HIGHROAD REPORT. WITH PUT PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY ON THE FRONT END OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS. RATHER THAN AN AFTERTHOUGHT THROUGH A SET OF SITES WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN PLACE. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE BY RELUCTANTLY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. WELL I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASED COST TO SOME G. G. R. OF PROGRAMS WITH THIS BILL I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU. THAT SACRIFICING THE COST OF LABOR IS THE LAST PLEASE WE SHOULD BE CUTTING. ESPECIALLY NOW. THIS BILL WILL LEAD TO MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS AND ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE. WE FIND ALMOST HALF OF OUR FAMILIES AND CONSTRUCTION WORK IN CALIFORNIA- AND ROLLED IN SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AN ANNUAL COST OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS. AND THIS IS A REPORT FROM THE UCBERKELEY LABOR CENTER IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT BEING SAID I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FINDING A PATH FOR THIS BILL TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON SIX EIGHTY TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES WHICH NEED THESE CLIMB INVESTMENTS MOST ARE NO LONGER LEFT BEHIND. THANK YOU SUMMER I'M- YOUR COMMENTS. SHE TOOK SEVEN MINUTES APPRECIATE OUR CONVERSATION FROM THE OTHER DAY- OKAY LET'S GO LET'S NOW OPEN UP THE PHONE LINE AS WELL AS IS ANYONE HERE PERSON WAS EXPRESSIVE FOR THE BILL JEREMY SPENCER.

WE SHOULDN'T SACRIFICE THE COST OF LABOR. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT HUNTER OF THE STATE BUILDING TRADES AND I AND MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN SAYING ON MANY BILLS THIS SESSION- WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS THESE G. G. R. FUNDS FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE'S BILL TO- FINALLY- PUT SOME. PARAMETERS AROUND HOW THAT MONEY IS SPENT TO ENSURE THAT EQUITY IS- INCLUDED TO ENSURE THAT- THESE PUBLIC DOLLARS GO TO GOOD WAGES GOOD BENEFITS GOOD JOBS THAT'S SOMETHING THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND IN PARTICULAR THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR DECADES- I IT'S THE IT'S THE BASIS FOR THE PREVAILING WAGE. IT'S THE BASIS FOR THE LABOR MOVEMENT. AND WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT HER EFFORT TO- AS I SAID PUT SOME PARAMETERS AROUND THESE DOLLARS FOR THAT A POLICYMAKERS- HACKS PAIRS THE LABOR MOVEMENT WE ALL UNDERSTAND WE KNOW WHERE THIS MONEY'S GOING. AND THAT IT'S PROVIDING ACCORDIONS PROVIDING- THE MIDDLE CLASS LIVELIHOOD FOR THE WORKERS IN INDUSTRIES WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM THE G. R. I.

HOWEVER EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THAT WHEN A CITY OR COUNTY EXPRESSES AN INTEREST IN PURCHASING THESE PARCELS AGENCIES LIKE CALTRANS MUST SELL THE PROPERTY AT FAIR MARKET VALUE WHICH CREATES ANOTHER OBSTACLE IN A LOT OF ADDITIONAL COSTS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT SO THIS BILL HELPS THIS ISSUE BY AUTHORIZING A CALTRANS TO SELL EXCESS PROPERTIES TO CITIES AND COUNTIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING EMERGENCY SHELTERS OR FEEDING PROGRAMS OF THE PROPERTY'S ORIGINAL ACQUISITION VALUE. THAT WOULD FACILITATE THE TRANSFER IS STRATEGICALLY LOCATED ACCESS LAND FOR THE USE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PROVIDES AN INNOVATIVE TOOL TO ADDRESS OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS AND REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AND SPUR JOB GROWTH ACROSS CALIFORNIA ON THE LINE TODAY HAVE ONE WITNESS DANNY GOES THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALTRANS IN SUPPORT AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST- I BUT WHEN THE TIME COMES THANK YOU THE DESIGNER ALL RIGHT LET'S HEAR.

NO SENATOR I EVER RESPECTED YOUR COMMENT THAT YOU MEAN TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE- BUT- WE COULD ALSO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS WHICH WERE THE NATIVE AMERICANS IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ORIGINAL OWNERS. THIS IS A NOW IN THE PUBLIC PORTFOLIO AND IT'S OUR INTENT WHERE WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT FOR AN IMMEDIATE PUBLIC- PROCESS IMMEDIATE PUBLIC TOP PRIORITY WHICH IS. AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. NO I'LL BE OPPOSING BILLION TODAY. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WHEN WE EMINENT DOMAIN SOME IS PROPERTY IT'S FOR A REASON. AND THAT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY WHICH MAKES AMERICA UNIQUE TO MOST OTHER COUNTRIES- THEY DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND- WE ONLY USED. THE EMINENT DOMAIN PROCESS WHEN IT'S GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC IN THIS CASE IT SHOULD BE OFFERED BACK TO THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND WAS TAKEN FROM FOR THOSE REASONS WILL BE OPPOSE IN THE BILL. CENTER STERN. THANK YOU- THANK YOU SUMMER FOR- BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IN. EURO APPROACH THIS YEAR VERY CREATIVE AND PROGRESSIVE WHEN IT COMES TO PUSHING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PARADIGM FORWARD- I WANTED TO ASK THOUGH FOR YOUR SPONSOR I'M TRYING TO I DID NOT GET A SENSE FROM THE ANALYSIS- BUT WHAT WHAT KINDS OF PROJECTS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT- I'M I'M CURIOUS IF CALTRANS AS A- A LIST OF POTENTIAL SITES ARE PROPERTIES. MAP AND INVENTORY EVEN JUST EXAMPLES THAT I MEAN IN IN DISTRICT SEVEN WHICH IS A HUGE STRETCH IF CALTRANS LAND AND SOME OF THAT'S MY DISTRICT BUT- IN CENTER ALLEN SHARES THAT AND MAY EVEN GO TO CENTER GONZALEZ IS COMMUNITY THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROPERTIES TOO SO I I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. WHAT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY LIKELY TO SEE IS THE OUTCOME OF THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU CENTER- I'M AWARE OF HUNDREDS OF PROPERTIES AT THE DEPARTMENT TELLS US ARE SUITABLE FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD- BE CONSISTENT AND ADJACENT TO OTHER SITES THAT ARE. FOR THE COMMUNITY- I'LL DEFER TO THE WITNESS ABOUT MORE SPECIFICS I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN SEEING THE SPECIFICS OF THAT LIST. I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST UPDATED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. MISTER GUEST YET FOR MR YOST. YES- WE- WE DO HAVE- A LIST OF PROPERTIES THAT ARE OF HIGH POTENTIAL TO- CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD TO THE PROCESS- FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING- AND MAYBE- MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR THAT PURPOSE- I WOULD SAY IN ADDITION TO THAT- THERE IS- THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SELL PROPERTIES THAT WERE- PURCHASED. FROM PREVIOUS OWNERS BACK TO THOSE OWNERS OFTENTIMES IN A PROJECT- PROPERTY TO BE CONFIGURED- SO IT MAY NOT BE IN THE SAME SHE PERFORMED GOD- SOMEBODY MAY APPROACH THE PREVIOUSLY. SOME ISSUES CAN CAN WE SEE THAT LIST. YES ABSOLUTELY SB GREAT I THINK YOU-KNOW IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH TO VOTE- ON ON A BILL WHERE I DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT I'M VOTING FOR- FOR THE SAKE OF- FOR THE SAKE OF DISCUSSION DAVE NECESSARY WILL MOVE ALONG AND- GIVE IT A COURTESY VOTE BUT I THINK BEFORE THE FLOOR CERTAINLY BUT IDEALLY- THE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IF YOU'VE GOT IT TODAY EVEN THOUGH I'D LOVE TO SEE IT- BEFORE TAKING A VOTE HERE JUST BE GOOD TO KNOW. WHAT WERE- WHAT WE'RE SIGNING ON TO I THINK THAT THERE'S HUGE POTENTIAL HERE AND I DON'T I DON'T MEAN TO IMPLY THAT- THIS THIS WON'T MAKE SENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES I GUESS MY- WHAT'S DRIVING MY CONCERN IS IF WE'RE IF WE'RE LOOKING AT SORT OF THE SUBPRIME PROPERTIES FOR INSTANCE OR PLACES THAT ARE. UNDER THE FREEWAY JUST FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE- YOU KNOW SORT OF HIGH OPPORTUNITY ZONES BEING PRIORITIZE I KNOW THAT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE INTENT- I THINK THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF CREATIVE THINGS WE CAN DO IT CALTRANS PROPERTY SO- BUT I JUST. BE GOOD TO PUT SOME MEAT ON THE BONES BEFORE WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY MAKE SOME FINAL DECISIONS HERE DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF TIMELINE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT SOMETHING WE CAN DO. EXPEDITIOUSLY MISTER YES. I BELIEVE SO THAT THE MAIN ON ISSUES MAKING SURE THE FIVE FOR BOULDER YOU KNOW WHERE THE PROPERTIES ARE- SO. THAT'S SOMETHING I'LL MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE DO ACTUALLY DISTANTLY OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. SIR KASKI. SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. WE ALL UNDERSTAND LEASE MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION IS HERE BECAUSE BASICALLY WHAT I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL AS I'VE READ IT IS THAT HE SAID THE SALE TO THE CITY IS EXEMPT FROM SEQUEL ANALYSIS SO WE HAVE WITH THE SIR CALTRANS PROPERTY SO THEY MAY HAVE HAD. WE DISAPPEAR BICYCLE ELECTRIC BICYCLE BILL OR YOU KNOW- FREE WAITED THERE WITH THERE HAS BEEN AN ENVIRONMENTAL. WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY AND WHAT YOU IN ALL THIS BILL DOES HE SAID IT SAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO NOTIFY THE CITIES THAT IF THEY PUT A FIFTY FIVE YEAR. TERM FOR AFFORDABLE THIRTY HAVE A THE GROSS INCOME DOES NOT EXCEED A HUNDRED TWENTY THAT THERE THAT THEY USE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE THAT THEY HAVE SIXTY DAYS AFTER CALTRANS. DOES THAT TO SELL THE PROPERTY THAT DOESN'T AFFECT WHAT SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS MAY COME IN. AND OTHER CONCERNS AT THE CITIES HAVE ONCE THAT SALE IS DONE AND THEN THAT. PROJECT COMES TO LIFE IS THAT'S A SANITIZED REDUCTION OF WHAT THE WHAT WHAT IS THE SEQUEL EXCEPTION HERE'S INTEREST THE SALE THAT IS RIGHT SO THAT- TO HAVE AG CLARITY THAT THE US SALE THE ACTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING HERE- IS CATEGORICALLY EXEMPT FROM SEQUEL AND THEN YOU'RE RIGHT SHOULD A- PROJECT WE PROPOSE THAT HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY COM- EVALUATED UNDER. A PLAN OR A COMPARABLE PROJECT AND THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL SEEK REVIEW SOME SUIT THE I THINK I HEARD SOME OF THE OBJECTIONS OVER THE PROPOSED SKILLED AND TRAINED LABOR PROVISIONS THAT ARE BEING PUT IN THIS LANDUSE- BYLAWS. AND BILL IF THAT'S TRUE IF THE OPPOSITION'S TRUE THEN NO CITIES WOULD RESPOND MY GUESS IS WHAT WE WOULD HAVE THIS BILL WE GIVE CALTRANS IS OPPORTUNITY. BUT THEN CALTRANS WOULD COME BACK AND SAY. WHAT'S PLAN B. AND WE COUNTLESS. OF CITIES AND UTILIZES AND TRAINED WORKFORCE- A- PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION- BUILT IN THERE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN FOR NINETY FIVE CITIES WILL TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS OKAY. VERY GOOD. YES IF I COULD DO THAT ONE MORE THING THE WAY I READ THAT PROVISION ALSO IS IT'S AN INTEMPERATE SENTENCE ABOUT PROMOTION. THAT THE DEADLINE YOU YOU SAID APPLY BEFORE BUT NOW IT'S ABOUT PROMOTING THE USE SO IT'S NOT ALSO A HARD AND FAST MANDATE IN THE LEGISLATION. WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ON DRAFT LANGUAGE- TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WOULD IMPLEMENT IN A WAY THAT IS SATISFACTORY FOR THEM AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE TRADES AND BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL AS WELL. GREAT THANK YOU. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SITES- HAVE BEEN DEEMED OKAY FOR HOUSING I MEAN THIS IS ALL THIS IS A PROCESS IT'S- I WORKED OUT LOCALLY. THEY'RE ALL SUITABLE FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION YEAH OKAY. OKAY. THE ADDAMS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER STERN ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY CLOSE I THANK YOU RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ARRIVA OKAY ALL RIGHT LET'S CIRCLE THE VOTE COUNT- CONSULTANTS CALDERON ITEM NUMBER SIX AB NINE FIFTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALLEN HI ALLEN AYE BATES. DALLI DALLI NO GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I SKINNER. STERN BY EASTERN IOWA CASKEY BY CASKEY I. STRAIGHTER ONE ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA HOLD THAT OPEN FOR CENTERS INTERNET ON. THANK YOU- LET'S NOT GO TO SUMMER BERMAN WHO'S HERE TO PRESENT HIS ITEM NUMBER EIGHT THIS AB. THIRTEEN FORTY SIX. OKAY EVERYTHING IS THE ACTUAL FIGHTING. SURE SURE. YEAH. RECEIVE HONORARY MARC THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SANDERS. WHICH. AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX WILL REQUIRE ZERO EMISSIONS FROM NEW SMALL OFF ROAD ENGINES SOLD IN CALIFORNIA ON OR AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BASED ON TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY SMALL OFF ROAD ENGINES KNOWN AS SOAR ARE MAINLY USED IN LANDSCAPING EQUIPMENT SUCH AS LEAF BLOWERS AND LAWN MOWERS AND OTHER OUTDOOR POWER EQUIPMENT OPERATING A COMMERCIAL LEAF BLOWER FOR ONE HOUR AND MINUTES SMOG FORMING EMISSIONS COMPARABLE TO DRIVING A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TOYOTA CAMRY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED MILES OR FROM SACRAMENTO TO DENVER. IN FACT SMOG FORMING EMISSIONS FROM SORE ARE PROJECTED TO SURPASS THOSE FROM PASSENGER CARS IN CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR. AMONG IMMEDIATELY IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO BREATHING CAUSES UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS TO WORSEN. GAS ENGINES ADDITIONALLY RELEASE BENZENE A CARCINOGEN AND HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF ALTER FINE PARTICLES WHICH CAUSE LUNG CANCER HEART DISEASE STROKES. ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY AILMENTS. GAS POWERED EQUIPMENT POLLUTES THE AIR WE ALL BREATHE BUT IT ESPECIALLY IMPACTS LANDSCAPING PROFESSIONALS WHO INHALE EXHAUST FROM GAS POWERED EQUIPMENT FOR HOURS EVERY DAY. FORTUNATELY THERE IS A FIX ZERO MISSION EQUIPMENT THAT IS CLEAN AND QUIET AND DOESN'T CONTAMINATE THE AIR WE BREATHE OR HARM THE HEALTH OF THOSE WHO USE IT. AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX PHASES AND IS ZERO EMISSION STANDARD FOR SALES OF NEW STORE EITHER BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OR WHEN THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD DETERMINES IS TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE WHICHEVER IS LATER. I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND DOES NOT DO. THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN THE USE OF GAS POWERED EQUIPMENT. EVERYONE CAN CONTINUE USING THE EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE UNTIL IT BREAKS DOWN. BUSINESSES WILL NOT HAVE TO REPLACE ALL OF THEIR EQUIPMENT TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THIS BILL DOES NOT REGULATE CONSTRUCTION OR FARM EQUIPMENT INCLUDING ANY EQUIPMENT OVER TWENTY FIVE HORSEPOWER WHICH IS FEDERALLY PREEMPTED. PREOPTIC WOMEN INCLUDES BRUSH CUTTERS IN CLEARING SAWS FORTY CC AND ABOVE IN WOOD CHIPPERS. THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO LARGE CHAIN SAWS WITH ENGINE SIZE OVER FORTY FIVE CC. IT DOES APPLY TO SMALL CHAINSAWS IN ADDITION AND THERE IS A SAFETY PURCHASE EXEMPTION BUILT INTO THE REGULATION SO CAL FIRE WILL BE ABLE TO PURCHASE WHAT THEY NEED FOR FIRE FIGHTING PURPOSES AS WOULD CALTRANS OF THAT REQUIRE GAS POWERED EQUIPMENT FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. THIS BILL DOES APPLY TO SMALL PORTABLE GENERATORS UNDER TWENTY FIVE HORSEPOWER. HOWEVER CARP HIS PROPOSED A LATER PHASE IN DATE OF TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT FOR GENERATORS AND THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR THAT. AND LASTLY THIS BILL DOES RECOGNIZE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS BY REQUIRING INCENTIVES FOR COMMERCIAL OPERATORS. THE BILL REQUIRES CARB TO FIND INCENTIVES FOR ALL SORE WITHIN EXISTING PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ AND I ARE WORKING TO SECURE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET TO CREATE A DEDICATED INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR SMALL LANDSCAPING BUSINESSES AND SOLE PROPRIETORS TO TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT. ZERO MISSION AGREEMENT SAVES MONEY IN THE LONG RUN THROUGH LOWER FUEL AND MAINTENANCE COSTS BUT THE HIGHER UP FRONT COSTS OF BATTERIES IS A BARRIER TO ADOPTION ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE WHICH IS CURRENTLY LOW. THAT IS WHY THE FUNDING PIECE IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS EFFORT. SOME LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS INCLUDING SOUTH COAST IN SAN JOAQUIN ALREADY RUN COMPREHENSIVE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AND WE WANT TO EXPAND THAT STATEWIDE. I WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON FEASIBILITY. THERE ARE AT LEAST EIGHT BRANDS THAT PRODUCE COMMERCIAL GRADE ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT IN EACH MAJOR CATEGORY. AND EARLY ADOPTERS HAVE SHOWN. THAT THIS TRANSITION IS POSSIBLE. SEVERAL LANDSCAPING COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY OPERATE WITH FULLY ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT. AND LARGE INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS U. S. C. THE CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA AND WESTSIDE UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE LANCASTER PALMDALE AREA. HAVE TRANSITIONED TO CLEAN AND GREEN LANDSCAPING. AND AGAIN THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE ANYONE TO STOP USING WHAT THEY HAVE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IT ONLY BANS THE SALE OF NEW GAS POWERED SORE. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION FOR THE DIALOGUE THEY HAVE HAD WITH MY OFFICE. EVEN IF WE HAVE COME TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS. WITH ME I HAVE BILL MCGAVIN WITH THE- COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. AND DANIEL MADE WITH THE AMERICAN GREEN'S ON ALLIANCE WHO HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON THE BILL BUT IS HERE IN HIS CAPACITY AS A SUBJECT AREA EXPERT. WHO CAN ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S GO TO YOU BILL. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX IT'S STILL EARLY IN THE SUMMER AND THERE ALREADY HAVE BEEN SEVERAL DAYS HERE IN IN SACRAMENTO IN THE SOUTH COAST IN THE BAY AREA WHERE THE AIR QUALITY HAS BEEN SOMEONE HEALTHY THAT WE'VE HAD. SPARE THE AIR ALERTS AND THIS SECTOR SMALL OFF ROAD ENGINES HAS A SHOCKINGLY HIGH AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS AS MR BERMAN HAS POINTED OUT SO IT MUST BE ADDRESSED IN ORDER TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORKER HEALTH. THIS SHORT BILL HAS BEEN WELL CRAFTED TO WORK WITH THE ONGOING RULEMAKING PROCESS AS YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THERE RESOURCES BOARD HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY REGULATING THESE ENGINES FOR YEARS- THE RULEMAKING TO STRENGTHEN THOSE REGULATIONS NOW HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE YEAH IVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN IT IT'S MOSTLY. INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE THERE- AND THERE'S LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTICIPATION THAT RLEMAKING WILL HAPPEN WITH OR WITHOUT THIS BILL- BUT THIS BILL WILL HELP BY INVOLVING THE LEGISLATURE ADDING A STATUTORY MANDATE AND CALLING FOR INCENTIVE FUNDING TO HELP EASE THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT AND THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT THE BILL. OKAY THANK YOU SHOULD THAT ALL RIGHT LET'S NEXTCODE SO I GUESS YOU OKAY WE HAVE THE WITNESS FOR TECHNICAL EXPERTISE YEAH AND I THINK- MISTER MAY BE GIVING OPENING REMARKS I'D LIKE TO MAKE OKAY. SIX FIVE PLEASE- KITCHER ALLEN SENATORS MY NAME IS DANIEL MAY I'M WITH I'M THE FOUNDER OF THE AMERICAN GREEN'S ON ALLIANCE KNOWN AS AGATHA AG HELPS MUNICIPALITIES BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND NEIGHBORHOODS MAKE AND DURING TRANSITIONS AWAY FROM GAS POWERED OPERATIONS BY EDUCATING TRAININGAND CERTIFYING WORKERS WE ALSO PROVIDE HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFIT METRICS OF THOSE ELECTRIC OPERATIONS AS PART OF OUR CERTIFICATION PROGRAM OUR PROCESS IS FACTUAL AND OBJECTIVE. TODAY'S COMMERCIAL GRADE EQUIPMENT CAN PERFORM ALL BUT THE HEAVIEST GROUNDS MAINTENANCE TASKS BAGGA FINDS GAS EQUIPMENT IS STILL NEEDED FOR A LIMITED SEASONAL WORKLOADS IN INSTANCES WHERE A LEAD TRICK IS NOT ECONOMICALLY AND WORKLOAD FEASIBLE FOR THESE SITUATIONS WE ALWAYS RECOMMEND CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD COMPLIANT FOR STROKE A QUICK MINUTE. WE BELIEVE AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX WITH AS THE EXEMPTIONS ON CHAINSAWS FORTY FIVE CC'S AND BRUSH CUTTERS AND CLEARING SAWS FORTY SPECIES IS ADDRESSING THIS. TO DATE ADDS HAS CAN OVER SIX HUNDRED ACRES OF SERVICEABLE PROPERTY TO BATTERY ELECTRIC OPERATIONS FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE IMPROVEMENTS IN BATTERY TECHNOLOGY HAVE HELPED US ACHIEVE THIS BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS PROCESS. IS FINANCIAL RESOURCES EDUCATION TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION FOR THESE SIX HUNDRED ACRES OF THE BENEFITS OF THESE CONVERSIONS. HAVE RESULTED IN IMPROVED CONDITIONS FOR WORKERS REDUCTIONS AND OVER SEVENTEEN HUNDRED TONS OF EMISSIONS AND SAVINGS ON OPERATIONAL COSTS OVER TIME I AM AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IF NEEDED THANK YOU.

MAKING SURE MY SECULAR THREE FIFTY IN SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTEEN FORTY SIX. AND AT THE TIME OF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. GRAHAM. LET'S HEAR FROM THE LEADOFF POSITION WITNESSES- WE'VE GOT- YOU LIKE GARCIA FROM. WHO'S ACTUALLY HERE REPRESENTING THE PORTABLE GENERATOR MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION. THE MANAGER BRAVE FROM NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LANDSCAPE PROFESSIONALS AND ALSO GREG NOT FROM THE OUTDOOR POWER EQUIPMENT INSTITUTE WE WANT TO. ASK YOU TO- REVIEW RESPECTFULLY TO THIS TIMES AND KEEP. THE OPPOSITION COMMENTS QUICK SO WE CAN GET ALL THREE OF YOU. LET'S START WITH YOU I'M GONNA MEMBERS EAT. I THANK THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. GARCIA FOR THE PORTABLE GENERATOR MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION WE HAVE TAKEN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND HAVE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED THAT PORTABLE GENERATORS BE EXEMPT. FROM THE AIRBOARD UPDATED SO REGULATIONS. IN THIS BUILDING DOOR SPENT ON THE A OR B. RULE MAKING AND IT'S TIMELINE FAILED TO CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PORTABLE GENERATORS. AND HOUSEHOLD OR RESIDENTIAL LAWN AND GARDEN EQUIPMENT. WITHOUT ANY. AB FORTY SIX AND THEY ARE BEING. IN WOMAN IN BANNING THE SALE VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE PORTABLE GENERATORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIANS TODAY. DURING A LOSS OF POWER CUTS. I'M LIKE LAWN AND GARDEN EQUIPMENT. BUT TIME AND DURATION OF USE PORTABLE GENERATORS IS OFTEN NOT DISCRETIONARY. AND RELATE THAT TO THE DIRECTION OF THE POWER OUTAGE. CALIFORNIANS ARE INCREASINGLY RELYING ON PORTABLE GENERATORS FOR EMERGENCY POWER NEEDS. TO POWER GENERATORS RESPIRATORS AND OTHER CRITICAL MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. ZERO MISSION PORTABLE GENERATORS ARE NOT A VIABLE OR COMPARABLE OPTIONS FOR EMERGENCY BACKUP POWER NEEDS. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES THE PORTABLE GENERATORS ARE CONSTRAINED BY BATTERY CAPACITY. IT CAN ALSO BE FIVE TO TWENTY TIMES THE COST OF THE PORTABLE GENERATORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS TODAY. THE COMMITTEE NOW. ADDITIONALLY NOTES THAT THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT THE REQUIREMENTS BEING CONTEMPLATED BY THE A. R. B. FOR SOME SORT LIMIT COULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE IF NOT DOWNRIGHT IMPOSSIBLE TO TODAY. THAT REASON WE URGE YOU TO NOT SIMPLY ENDORSE THE ARBY'S REGULATION BUT INSTEAD TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE. THAT WILL BE CRITICAL PRESERVE PORTABLE GENERATOR OPTIONS DURING PS PS AND OTHER LOSS OF POWER BANKS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WE ALSO WANT TO THANK MR BERMAN AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR CLIMB THE TABLE FORKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU AYE OKAY LET'S GO TO ENTER BRAG. NEXT.

ALSO LIKE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN- I THINK WE SHARE A LOT MORE IN COMMON ON AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX AND RETURNED DIFFERENCE- WE SHARE THE SAME GOAL AS AN INDUSTRY IS WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN IS NOTABLY PUTTING COURSE AND WE WANT TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS. THE KEY DIFFERENCE FOR US IN THE THIRD BETWEEN COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL I WATCHED HIM TO FLEE THE COURT- AND APPLY BUT TO BE WITNESSES SUPPORT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT OF A PROCTOR SIX AND FOUR BARREL. THANK YOU COMPANIES MASS WE BELIEVE THAT COMPUTER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THIS WHOLE TRêN. BACK LESS THAN HALF A PERCENT OF ALL LANDSCAPE COMPANIES. WHEN WE ARE WORKING WITH AMERICAN COMPANIES ON ADDITIONAL CARBON. WE WILL GET A SPECIAL BLUE RIBBON TASK FORCE SIX THE THANK FOR HOW WE GET THERE. AND THE PROBLEM FRANKLY IS THEIR INITIAL COST EFFICIENCY COMPATIBILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SPEND THE REST OF THE TIME. BECAUSE AS MUCH WARRANT SOME OF THE LARGER EQUIPMENT AND THE COST FOR THE HANOVER QUICK MATH SIMILAR BUT WHEN YOU ASSOCIATE THE COSTS FOR BATTERIES IN THE AMOUNT OF BATTERY. THAT IS THE SIGNIFICANT COST THERE'S ALSO SICKENING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RETROFITTING YOUR SHOPS IN YOUR TRUCK OF THE HANDLE THAT SORT OF- ELECTRICAL LOAD. BERMAN PHYSICAL STANDPOINT THAT IS WHERE I DIFFER BASED ON THE TECHNICAL EXPERTS THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT BRAND I'M SO SORRY BUT- WE'RE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF YOUR SIDE OKAY I AM SO YOU CAN BOOK YEAH. WE'VE GOT ONE OTHER WITNESS TO TOTALLY UNDERSTAND I APOLOGIZE AND I WANNA MAKE SURE GREAT GET THE POINT I CAN'T I WOULD JUST. RISK RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SIMILAR BERMAN WE'RE LOOKING FOR A TWO TO THREE YEAR- DIFFERENT TIMELINE FOR COMMERCIAL USES AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK SPECIALLY WITH THE MEMBER BUT AT THIS TIME WE WILL OPPOSE AT ADDRESS ABSTRACT.

HI MY NAME IS AFRIKA MORTGAGE FOR THE WORKING LANDSCAPE NETWORK AND ALSO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION MISTER PROFESSIONALS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THE- VAST MAJORITY OF SMOKERS ARE LATINO AS WELL AS ONE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS. BUT OUR- THERE ARE SMALL THE SMALL GARDENING BUSINESS THIS BILL WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THOSE ORDERS AND FORCE THEM TO BUY THEIR EQUIPMENT AND STATE HOUSING CALIFORNIA TAX REVENUE THANK YOU. MY NUMBER ONE NINETY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING REBEKAH BACK AND ON BEHALF OF THE FAR WEST EQUIPMENT DEALERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU KNOW. AND AT THE TIME OF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE CAN QUEUE. OKAY GREAT OKAY SO NOW BECAUSE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND THOUGHTS AND DISCUSSIONS GOING TO SENATORS STERN. THANK YOU MR- I DON'T THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THE MEASURE FORWARD- AND ALWAYS DILIGENCE ON THIS MATTER AT THE- AND I WANT ONE ISSUE I WAS HOPING TO GET- MAYBE SOME TECHNICAL FEEDBACK ON OR FROM YOUR EXPERT- YOUR SPONSOR- WE DIDN'T TALK- IN QUANTIFIED TERMS ABOUT SOME OF THE HEALTH IMPACTS THAT OUR LANDSCAPE PROFESSIONALS ARE IN DURING BUT ALSO. THAT YOU KNOW WITH THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPACTS OF PORTABLE GENERATORS- AND HOW CRUCIAL THEY CAN BE- TO HOMEOWNERS WE'VE HAD MORE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS IN MY DISTRICT THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THE RECENT DATA WE'VE BEEN SEEING IS THAT- MISUSE OF THOSE EYES ARE DEEP EITHER DIESEL OR GAS POWERED GENERATORS ACTUALLY. VERY DANGEROUS AND EVEN DEADLY I THINK CONSUMER REPORTS THE WHAT I JUST SAW WAS IDON'T KNOW IF THERE'S MORE RECENT DATA BUT FROM 200-052-2017 NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED. OF CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING AND THE THOUSANDS OF BEEN POISONED- ON TOP OF THAT AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THROUGH THESE P. S. P. S. INCIDENTS WE'VE HAD A FEW DEATHS- EXPECTANT MOTHER IN TAX SHOULD BE- LAST YEAR- AND AT A PERSONAL LEVEL YOU KNOW WHEN WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE P. S. P. S. INCIDENTS. OR WHEN- YOU KNOW WHATEVER THAT THAT- LANDSCAPING EQUIPMENT IS BREAK BEHIND MY HOUSE THAT'S GOING. WHEN MY WIFE'S OUTSIDE SHE SEVEN HALF MONTHS PREGNANT SHE LIKES THE SOUND OF YEAH THE NEIGHBORHOODS BUZZING PEOPLE ARE WORKING YOU KNOW THERE'S SORT OF. NO NO CONCERNED ABOUT EVEN NOISE OR PEOPLE DOING THEIR JOBS BUT- THE NOTION OF BENZENE AND CARBON MONOXIDE GOING INTO THE LUNGS OF PREGNANT WOMEN AROUND CALIFORNIA WHICH IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH QUANTIFY LIKE. WHAT OTHER DATA BESIDES THAT TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUT- I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A CRITICAL CASE TO BE MADE ON THAT THE HEALTH SIDE OF THIS LEGISLATION NOT JUST. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TECHNOLOGY- AND I'M REALLY ENCOURAGES THE WITH THE INDUSTRY'S COMING UP WITH I DON'T SEE ANY LACK OF CAPITAL BY THE WAY COMING IN EITHER I THINK PORTAL GENERATOR SALES REP 2000% I THINK SINCE OUR PS PS STUFF BEGINNING CALIFORNIA SO THERE'S PLENTY CAPITAL I KNOW THERE'S THE KNOW HOW WITHIN. WHETHER IT'S GENERAC- YOU KNOW- SOME OF YOU KNOW GET YAMAHA KAWASAKI THESE ARE THESE ARE SMART COMPANIES I THINK WE CAN FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT BUT- JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU YOU ARE YOUR SPONSORS WANTED LENT ANY INSIGHT ON THE- THE NEAR TERM HEALTH IMPACTS ON EITHER OF THOSE ISSUES YES THANK YOU CENTER FOR. FURTHER COMMENTS IN QUESTION AND- YEAH LIKE YOU SAID THIS PLAN CAPITAL THEY ALSO HAVE MORE TIME ON THE GENERATOR FRONT BECAUSE CARP IS PLANNING TO. HAVE THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE FOR GENERATORS BE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT- SO THAT THAT SEVEN YEARS FROM NOW AND WE KNOW THAT THE TECHNOLOGY ALREADY EXISTS THAT'S A LOT OF TIME TO IMPROVE IT AND TO BRING THE COST DOWN. TO HAVE A BE MORE COST COMPARABLE. WITH THE GAS POWERED ALTERNATIVES- THE QUICK TOUCHING ON GENERATORS THE BILL APPLIES TO SPARK IGNITION PORTABLE GENERATORS UNDER TWENTY FIVE HORSEPOWER- SO LARGE STATIONARY GENERATORS AND DIESEL GENERATORS ARE NOT SUBJECT SUBJECT TO THIS BILL- SO THEY YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE STILL CAN USE THOSE IF THEY NEED TO YOU MADE A GOOD POINT THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN. IF YOU THE MISUSE THEM AND THERE CAN BE DEADLY HEALTH CONSEQUENCES TO THAT END OF THE SMALLER ONES AS WELL. THE ZERO EMISSION GENERATORS HAVE A HIGHER PRICE NOW WHICH IS WHY THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS OF A LATER PHASE AND A LIKE I MENTIONED TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT- AND- GOT A TALKING POINT THAT I HAVE REAL QUICK IS EXPOSURE TO CARCINOGENIC THIS APARTMENT CLOSE TO WILL NOW. NOT BE PART OF MY CLOTHES- X. TO CAR. AIRPORT AND HIGH LEVELS OF. FINE PARTICLES THAT CAUSE ASTHMA ANOTHER US- TESSA'S. TO BE FORTY TIMES HIGHER- FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN A TO- EXCUSE ME. TESTS HAVE SHOWN TO BE FORTY TIMES HIGHER. IF YOU'RE NEAR A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. MODEL LEAF BLOWER. THEN IF YOU'RE NEAR A BUSY INTERSECTION- AND THEN TO THAT JUST GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE- YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE HEALTH IMPACTS. I CAN BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU TO THE TECHNICAL AND EXPERT ON IT JUST JUST VERY BRIEFLY IF I MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK CENTER STERN YOU JUST MADE AN EXCELLENT CASE FOR WHY WE NEED TO UPGRADE THE STANDARDS AND MAKE THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT. AND AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE ZERO EMISSION GENERATORS AVAILABLE FUEL CELLS BATTERY POWERED WHEN YOUR GENERATORS AND WE NEED TO ACCELERATE THAT TRANSITION SO THAT THOSE ARE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY. AND THIS BILL WILL HELP TO DO THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT. HI I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ANY I DON'T THINK ANY SENATE CO AUTHORS ON THIS MEASURE SO IN ADDITION TO MOVING THE MEASURE. I WANTED GOING TO BE FIRST THANK YOU THINK AT LEAST JUMP ON I'LL BE SECOND TO THE CHAIR HOWEVER YOU WANT BUT IF THEY YOU CENTER AND THREE IF WE MAKE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL WE WILL- WILL DEFINITELY ADD ON CYNICAL AUTHORS VERY GOOD. APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU- MISTER MADE MIGHT HAVE. A POINT TO MAKE. THANK YOU- JUST FOR THE RECORD. AG'S IS NEUTRAL ON THE BILL- BUT- WE- ARE. FACT IT WAS CREATED. BY GAS PROFESSIONALS FOR GAS PROFESSIONALS. TO MAKE PRUDENT CHANGE. AND WE ARE HERE JUST TO GIVE YOU THE ROTH EXES AND OHS. OF WHAT ADDSIT HAS ACCOMPLISHED. AND WE ARE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE. FURTHER DATA. ON ON WHAT WE'VE DONE- ANYTIME YOU CAN CALL ON US AND WE WILL JUST GIVE YOU THOSE ROTH. EX'S AND OH'S THANK YOU. NAME IS MADE. OKAY I KNOW WE HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR DOLLY THAT'S WHAT WE. THE MEASURE CARE GOOD TO SEE YOU SENATE MEMBER- FIRST OFF I WANT TO SAY THAT- I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL A CIGARETTE THAT. I DID NOT SEE. THAT I'M NOT SURPRISED BY THAT AS IT'S WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT TO SEE I HAVE LOTS OF PERSONAL I WANTED THEIR RESUME ONE OF THE FIRST THE WITNESS THAT TED WENT ON REALLY FAST I COULDN'T CATCH ALL THE DETAILS. BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK ABOUT HOW THE DATA WAS GATHERED COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT FIRST OFF YES MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THAT THE DATA- WITH SOME FROM A PHONE SURVEY- THAT WAS A COMPONENT OF CARBS TWENTY TWENTY INVENTORY MODELING AND THAT CARBON VAULT INDUSTRY TO ENGAGE WITH DATA AND IDENTIFY OUT LIARS AND THE DATA THE DATA IS CURRENTLY WHAT WE HAVE INDUSTRY HASN'T PROVIDED ANY ALTERNATIVE DTA- SOURCE OF EMISSIONS- SO- YOU KNOW VERY OPEN TO IT TO. DIVING INTO THAT MORE WITH INDUSTRY IF THEY WANT TO PROVIDE SOME ALTERNATIVE DATA FOR US TO LOOK AT WELL I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE MAKING SOME REALLY- THIS ISN'T THIS IS A BIG PIECE OF LEGISLATION I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE VERY. BURDENS ON SPECIALLY PEOPLE WITH WHO ARE EXPERIENCING. IN A PUBLIC CAR SAFETY SHUT OFFS- AND I DID I JUST GOOGLE WHY WE WERE SITTING HERE- TWENTY FIVE HORSEPOWER IS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE CC SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FORTY SPECIES WHICH IS A VERY SMALL. GENERATOR WHICH CAN YOU KNOW KEEP YOUR- THE FRAZIER YEAH YOUR FRIDGE RATER YOUR VIEW OF YOUR LIFE- YOUR THE ERROR MONITORING IF YOU'RE DIFFER ON THE ALIVE SUPPORT WORKS THEIR STUFF SO I WANTED TO SHARE I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T A- NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT YET I THINK WE NEED MORE DATA I THINK THE DATA IS A LITTLE BIT SKEWED I THINK THAT- MORE I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE O A CARROT AND A STICK I FOR CHRISTMAS BY MYSELF- ACTUALLY A WHOLE SET OF CORDLESS. IMPACT WRENCHES I NORMALLY USE AIR DRIVEN WHICH I DID RUN A COMPRESSOR. STAY IN THE HOSE OUT AND THEY'RE AWESOME THIS STUFF THE TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY AMAZING AND I GOT A POLL SAW- TO TRIM THE TREES ON THE WAY INTO MY FARM SO MANY CLIP IT DOESN'T. GET THE MAYOR'S TORN OFF OF IT AND- IT WORKS GREAT. BUT WHEN I'M OUT IN THE FIELD. AND I HAVE TO GO TWENTY MILES. EITHER WAY BACK AND FORTH TO THE RANCH. I HAVE AN INVERTER. IT'S A PLUG IN THE IT'S IN YOUR PICK UP RIGHT AND YOU CAN CHARGE YOUR BATTERY SO I HAVE TO START TO PICK UP OF MY BATTERY GOES BAD DAD TO. CHARGE MY IMPACT RICH SO I THINK THERE'S I THINK MORE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS A STICK WHY DON'T WE JUST INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO CONVERT OVER WHO MAKE CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE INSTEAD OF SAYING HEY YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO BUY THESE PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO YEARS. PRICE TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST PHASE NOT GENERATORS ARE OUT FURTHER AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE LEGISLATION FOR ME IS THAT WHERE ENFORCEMENT WE'RE ALLOWING THEIR BOARD WHICH BY THE WAY I SPOKE EARLIER ON AND OTHER BILL WE HAD A NEAR THE AIRPORT WE JUST CHANGE THE WHOLE BOARD. THE BEHIND IT WITH THE SENATE JUST APPROVED. NEW MEMBERS THEIR BOARD THAT'S BECAUSE THE LAST. LORD WAS A PERFORMING AT THE AT THE LEVEL WE WANTED TO LET TO PERFORM AND WE SEE THAT A LOT HERE WHEN THE- HIGH SPEED TRAIN DOESN'T WORK WE JUST REPLACE THE PERSON WHO'S IN CHARGE AND YOU KNOW THE LAST GUY WASN'T OUR LAST GROUP WASN'T. THE ONE THAT DID IT AND THEN WHEN THAT DOESN'T WORK WE JUST CONTINUE TO DO WHAT. GOVERNMENT DOES IS REPLACE IT AND BLAME IT ON THE- OTHER GUY THAT'S NOT HERE ANYMORE. AND I DON'T LIKE THAT PROCESS I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO DO SOMETHING THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR CALIFORNIANS AND GET A GOOD POLICY OUT. SO IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS GONNA DEFINITELY IMPACT A LOT OF PEOPLE. GONNA IN IMPACT A- SMALL MINORITY LANDSCAPERS IT'S GOING TO IMPACT. I'M ALWAYS GLAD TO HEAR THAT US GUYS INACCURATE EXEMPT THANK YOU FOR THAT- BUT WON'T NEED LONG WHEN THEY'RE BORED COMES AFTER THAT GUYS. JUST LIKE THEY'RE DOING WITH OUR- FARMING EQUIPMENT THAT WASN'T PART OF THE TRANSPORTATION PACKAGE. SO I'M PUTTING OUT A LOT OF CITIES THINGS HERE BUT I JUST ENSURE THAT I DON'T I DON'T THINK THIS IS REALLY COOKED WELL I THINK THERE'S A LOT THINK I THINK THAT DATA NEEDS TO BE ONFIRMED NOT JUST A PHONE SURVEY THAT'S THAT'S- PRETTY GENERIC. WE NEED TO HAVE REAL RAW DATA AND THE OPPOSITION POINTED OUT THAT THEY ACTUALLY FOLLOWED UP ON SOME OF THE PHONE DATA AND- FOUND THAT. AT LEAST IN THEIR SIDE OF IT WASN'T AT THAT WASN'T. REPORTED ACCURATELY SO WE'RE MAKING A BIG DECISION IN CALIFORNIA. ON I THINK NOT A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION. SO IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THOSE I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU SENATOR- AND- IT'S- THE FARM EQUIPMENT AND- THE FIREFIGHTING EQUIPMENT. IS EXEMPT UNDER FEDERAL LAWSUIT SO CAR CAN'T COME. FOR YOUR FOR YOUR FARM EQUIPMENT- THANK GOD AND THIS IS A CHANGE IN IN FEDERAL LAW. BUT I ALSO JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW RE EMPHASIZE THAT THIS DOESN'T TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM. FROM PEOPLE SO IF YOU HAVE GAS POWERED EQUIPMENT- YOU CAN CONTINUE TO USE THAT. UNTIL YOU KNOW DO THE REPAIRING IT YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO REPAIR IT ANYMORE AND UNTIL THIS IS AND OF USE AND SO. YOU CAN KEEP ON USING THAT POST THE FIRST POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION DATE WOULD BE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OR LATER DEPENDING ON ON CARDS- TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY DECIDE. TO PUSH THAT BACK LATER LIKE THEY'VE ALREADY SAID THEY WILL FOR THE GENERATORS WHICH WILL BE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AT THE EARLIEST AND SO- YOU KNOW I'LL JUST SAY I THINK THIS WILL HAVE A BIG IMPACT I THINK I HAVE A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT. ON ON THE PEOPLE WHO USE THE EQUIPMENT- WHO WERE YOU KNOW SUFFERING FROM THE NEGATIVE HEALTH. CONSEQUENCES THAT THAT CENTER STERN MENTIONED- AND THEN IT'LL HELP IT'LL HELP YOU KNOW ALL THE ENVIRONMENT AND HELP US REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND SMOG. CREATING EMISSIONS- THAT THE CURRENT EQUIPMENT. CREATES AND SO- I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL BE A CHANGE IT'LL BE A GRADUAL CHANGE- BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO REPLACE EVERYTHING RIGHT AWAY THE CAN DO IT SLOWLY IS AS- INDIVIDUAL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT BREAKDOWN- BUT I THINK. THIS IS A FEATURE THAT WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO GO- E. AND YEAH THIS IS JUST THE BILL REALLY JUST SAYS TO CARB. YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE REGULATIONS BY A CERTAIN DATE AND IT LEAVES IT UP TO CARVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS THE RIGHT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS THE RIGHT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY SIX IS THE RIGHT YEAR. YOU KNOW THE REGULATORS WILL THAT MAKE THAT MAKE THAT DETERMINATION- BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW. THIS IS A CHANGE AND- THE KNOW CHANGES ALL HARD. PERSEVERANCE SAY THAT. AT LEAST IN MY OFFICE I GET CALLS EVERY DAY ABOUT HOW WE SEE THE LEGISLATURE GAVE THE POWER TO SOME OTHER AGENCY THAT TOOK IT AWAY FROM THERE FROM THE LEGISLATORS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT GIVES POWER TO THEIR BOARD TO MAKE A DECISION THE SAME POWER WE GAVE TO THE PARMA TOXIC SUBSTANCE AND THE WATER BOARD AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT DON'T DON'T HAVE TO STAND FOR ELECTION. ARE GETTING THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE LOS FURTHER OUT WE WON'T BE HERE WE'LL PROBABLY MORE LIKELY BE TURNED OUT AND THEN THOSE LAWS ARE GOING TO FACT AND YOU KNOW THE HISTORY GETS LOST AND THEN WE END UP WITH. BUREAUCRATS MAKING LAWS. THAT REALLY WILL IMPACT OUR PEOPLE NOT ON GOOD COMMON SENSE OF. THOSE RESULT BE OPPOSING THIS I APPRECIATE THAT JUST A QUICKLY NOTE THIS LOT TO ISN'T THE ONE THAT GIVES CARVE THE AUTHORITY THEY% ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY- THIS THIS BILL WOULD SAY YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT BY A CERTAIN TIME. AND ALSO TRY TO FREE UP. FUNDING BUT BUT BUT THE- LEAD TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- I WANT I THINK THE AUTHOR AS WELL FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW WE HAD A QUICK CHAT OVER THE WEEKEND ABOUT THIS AND- OF THE WAY THAT YOU'VE CRAFTED THE BILL IN IN TERMS OF. BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AIR BE DISCONCERTED SET THAT RULE MAKING AND I KNOW THAT'S IN PROGRESS- BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND EVEN IN OUR BACKYARD SOUTH COAST A CANDY- OF COURSE. I WILL ALWAYS ADVOCATE FOR THE EQUITY COMPONENT AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THAT AS WELL AND ENSURING THAT. SPECIALLY ARE LATINO BUSINESS OWNERS AND THIS IS BEEN SAID IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS- BUT THAT THEY DON'T GET LEFT BEHIND IN THIS CONVERSATION AND ALL MANY CITIES AND LOCALITIES ARE CREATING EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS- A ONE SHEET. IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE FALLING OFF OF A CLIFF HERE THIS IS THEIR LIVELIHOOD AS WELL AND I KNOW WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT- BUT- THEY NEED TO ALSO UNDERSTAND TO SENATOR STERN'S POINT. THE HEALTH IMPACTS THAT THERE. CERTAINLY UNDERTAKING. WHILE THEY'RE BECOMING ENTREPRENEURIAL AND THOSE HEALTH IMPACTS JUST LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE ZERO MISSION SPACE FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES MET MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY IN THE PORT- ARE. ARE SIGNIFICANT SOME OF US AND YOU KNOW LONG BEACH AREA THE WEST SIDE OF LONG BEACH. SOUTHEAST L. A. ARE DEALING WITH DOUBLE IMPACTS. BELIEVE THERE IS SUCH A- THE GENERATORS ON TOP OF THE DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER AT OUR PORTS. SO IT'S JUST A COMPOUNDING OF ISSUES AND SO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE GOT A LOT. TO WORK ON HERE TO BE ABLE TO JUST DRIVE THAT FORWARD- BUT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT. HOPEFULLY WORKING WITH LOCALS AS WELL NOT TO BE AS PUNITIVE AS AS ON THE FRONT END. BUT TO WORK WITH- THE LOCALS AND WITH THESE- A SMALL BUSINESSES TO GET US TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN ALL AGREE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER I AGREE A 100% AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT. THE NEED FOR THE CARROTS THAT CENTER DAHLE I WAS TALKING ABOUT YEAH THAT THAT IS BECOME MORE AND MORE APPARENT TO ME IS THE BILL HAS MOVED ON AND- I AM I AM. YOU'RE VERY FOCUSED ON GETTING IT YOU KNOW. TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR INCENTIVES ASIAN PROGRAM TO HELP WITH THAT TRANSITION. YOUR POINT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE HAVE TO MAKE IT. VERY CLEAR AND EASY FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY ONCE WE GET THE FUNDING THAT THAT FUNDING EXISTS THAT THEY QUALIFY FOR IT- AND I HAVE A LOT OF- JOINING CO AUTHORS WHO ARE. VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT ISSUE AS WELL AND WILL NOT LET ME- THE- DID SKATE BY IF THAT'S NOT ADDRESSED SO- APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. SARCASTIC GOOD LUCK ON THE FUNDING PIECE I WAS HAVING A CHAT WITH MY COLLEAGUE OF REMINDING HIM OF TWO THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE SENATE HAD ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE CAR MORE YOUR PLAN AND UNFORTUNATELY WE COULDN'T GET TO A THREE WAY DEAL WITH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE AND THE GOVERNOR SO GLAD TO HEAR LEGISLATION COMING IN FROM THE OTHER HOUSE ON THIS THING I THINK I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR BILL WHEN I INITIALLY LOOKED AT IT AND- I REAL BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED THAT THERE WAS SOME CONFLICT BETWEEN THE AIRPORT AND LEGISLATION AND YOU KNOW WE IN THE LAW WE DON'T LIKE WHEN. PEOPLE ARE MAKING DECISIONS WE DON'T WANT TO COME IN AND SAY IT'S GOING T BE THIS WAY AND ACTUALLY IS A FURTHER REVIEW OF IT WE AS HAVE STAFF REPORT POINTS OUT THE AIRPORT IS DEALING WITH THIS RECORD THESE REGULATIONS THERE INDICATING AND THEY THE THEY'RE INDICATING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME THIS FALL AND COME UP WITH IT. IN YOUR- BILL MARY STAT WITH WHATEVER TIME WHEN THEY COME INTO YOU THE ONLY HAMMER IF THERE IS A HAMMERS SAID FINISH THE REGULATIONS BY JULY FIRST. NEXT YEAR IT IS THAT'S ALL WE WANT IS WE WANT THIS THING TO BE DONE AND WHAT THE PROHIBITION IS ON THE SEWERS OR THE COMMISSION. EVAPORATIVE EMISSIONS THAT USING IT LIMITATION YOU FOLKSTAKE CARE THAT TECHNICAL STUFF AND THEN. THE OTHER INCENTIVE HE SAID. WE I WANT THIS TO HAPPEN ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHICH IS REALLY. THAT DIALOGUE BETWEEN THIS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LASSEN COUNTY WAS SAYING IS THAT WE ALREADY DELEGATED OR HE DIDN'T SAY THAT YOU SAID THAT THE WE DELEGATE THE AUTHORITY. GRANTED THESE REGULATIONS BUT NOW THE LEGISLATURE IS TRYING TO GIVE SAYS SHAPE SOME SORT OF. COURSE HERE IN SAYING IN WOULD LIKE THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN ON- THE TWENTY FIRST- THE PIECE THAT'S NOT. TALKED ABOUT. IS THAT THE CARL MOYER AND THE SMALL BIT. BIT WHERE YOU'RE- MAKING THE ASKING THE AIRPORT TO MAKE WHEN THEY DO THESE REGULATIONS TO MAKE THOSE FUNDS AVAILABLE. TO COMMERCIAL. FOR COMMERCIAL REBATES AND THAT SORT OF BEEN SILENT HERE SO I KNOW. OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH IS WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THIS BUSINESS BECAUSE WE FOR WE'VE ALL HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION ON THIS. BUT BUT- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT THAT THAT THIS IS THIS IS SOME GUIDANCE HERE BUT THIS IS THIS TRAINS LEFT THE STATION ALREADY AT THE AIRPORT AND THEY'RE GOING YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE GOT WE GOT THE RIGS ARE ON THIS STATE CERTAIN AND THIS COULD TAKE EFFECT ON THE STATE'S CERTAIN. THAT'S RIGHT AND THEN YOUR POINT ABOUT ABOUT HE DIED DROWNING GUIDANCE TO CARBON. TYPES OF EQUIPMENT- THAT PEOPLE CAN GET REBATES OR INCENTIVES FUNDING FOR IS LIKE YOU SAID KIND OF THE QUIET BUT VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE BILL SO THAT MORE- COMMERCIAL- LANDSCAPING COMPANIES CAN QUALIFY. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AND CAN QUALIFY FOR MORE A BROADER RANGE OF EQUIPMENT- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY NARROW ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE ITS BROADER ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE. AND THAT'S WHY A LOT OF- EQUALITY DISTRICTS UTILIZE RESIDENTIAL REBATES BUT NOT SO MUCH COMMERCIAL AND I THINK. WE NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON THE COMMERCIAL. TO BE HONEST. YEAH. OKAY. ALL RIGHT I'M- CHECK YEAH HI I WAS VERY NON MOVED. JUDGE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE VERY WELL HANDLED THANK YOU RESPECT AFTER AYE VOTE. FIVE CONTROL THE CAR.

WARNER IS ONE OF THE MOST CLIMATE CHALLENGE REGION IN NORTH AMERICA IN THE LOS ANGELES REGION SPECIFICALLY IT IS EXPECTED TO WARM FOUR TO FIVE DEGREES BY MID CENTURY AND THE YEARLY NUMBER OF DAYS OVER NINETY FIVE DEGREES IS PROJECTED TO ALMOST QUADRUPLE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. CLIMATE SCIENTISTS PREDICTED THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO FOR TWENTY FIFTY SEA LEVEL RISE ALONG THE CALIFORNIA COAST FIVE TO TWENTY FOUR INCHES. TIDES AND STORM SURGE CAN CAUSE COASTAL FLOODING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY WHEN BIG WEIGHT STORMS OCCURRING HIGH TIDE. LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALSO SUFFERS FROM SOME OF THE WORST AIR POLLUTION IN THE COUNTRY WHICH IS A PROBLEM WORSENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. WATER TEMPERATURES SPEED UP THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS THAT CREATE GROUND LEVEL OZONE THE MAIN COMPONENT OF SMOG. GROUND LEVEL OZONE IS GOING TO ASTHMA BRONCHITIS HEART ATTACKS AND PREMATURE DEATH.

AT THIS TIME IF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO MONEY Q. SO LET'S BRING THE BILL BACK TO COMMITTEE I WANT TO I DO CERTAINLY- REALLY WANT TO GO. AND APPRECIATE THE- COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- HAVING BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR I LOVE THE IF YOU CAN GIVE A THAT BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY HAD WE HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE BILL IS FOR AND I KNOW THAT SENATE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES HAD SOME CONCERNS FINANCIALLY AS WELL I WANT TO THINK THAT. NOT TO RESOURCES STAFF AND OUR STAFF AND THE AUTHOR STAFF ALL WORKING TOGETHER TO- TO. YOU KNOW TO DO IT WILL BASICALLY TAKE WHAT I THINK WITH THAT THAT IT'S COR- VERY LAUDABLE AND IMPORTANT GOALS AT THE HEART OF THE BILL- BUT- REFOCUS THEM IN A WORKABLE WAY. AND- AND REALLY WHAT WE ARE WITH MY TOWARD CENTERING EQUITY I'M USING THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE ATTY METRICS AND TIMETABLES I'M SORRY THANK YOU FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED I LET'S OPEN UP THE FLOOR TO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS- CENTER CASKEY SO I UNDERSTAND THE SEVEN. THURMOND I HAVE TO ASK YOU THE QUESTION SINCE YOU'RE PRESENTING ON THIS SO THE DEBATE. HAS BEEN THAT WHEN SCHWARZENEGGER SET UP THE CLIMATE ACTION TEAM HE NAMED IT A NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCIES THAT THAT'S THIRTEEN YEARS AGO WHAT'S EVOLVED IS THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT- P. R. N. AND THE STRATEGIC GROWTH CANCEL MADE TO A BETTER JOB AT AT STRATEGIC RESILIENCY PLANNING AND RECOMMENDATION AND IDENTIFYING WHAT NEEDS TO OCCUR ON THE GROUND. THE BILL HAS BEEN INTRODUCED. DELEGATED THAT AUTHORITY TO THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNSEL NINE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE GOING TO DIRECT. DID NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH WHICH IN MY MIND IS THE BETTER PLACE FOR THIS THING TO LAND RIGHT TO IT AS PART OF THE UPDATES TO THE SAFEGUARDING. CALIFORNIA SUIT SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA. IS A REPORT SO THE NATURAL RESOURCES WORKS WITH ALL THE AGENCIES GETS THE STUFF GETS WHAT CALTRANS TO AN EDITOR THAT I. DOES THE FIFTY SUSSMAN IF WE ALLOCATE SOME MONEY BUT THAT'S TO BE DETERMINED LATER BUT SO THE QUESTION IS ALL THE OTHER WORK YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING READING THE REPORT BUT THE STRATEGIES TO BE DOING THAT. IS THAT ARE WE GIVING THE DIRECTIONS TO THE OPR. CAN HAVE IT MAKE SURE THE REPORTERS THAN WHAT THE RESOURCE AGENCY- BECAUSE WE'RE NOT REQUIRING THIS RETREAT YOU GULF COUNCIL TO DEVELOP IT. CAN I. I SEE THE STAFF REPORT BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY DON'T SEE A MOCK UP BUT THAT WOULD BE MY- THE HELPFULL RECOMMENDATIONS. BECAUSE THEY'RE THE CLIMATE PEOPLE. SO MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEFERRED TO THE CHAIR IS THAT IS THAT THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHORING CULT IN CONSULTATION OF DETERMINE THAT OPR IS THE BEST AGENCY TO TAKE CAN LEAD THIS PROCESS SINCE YOU'RE THE PROCESS- AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THEIR WAITING INPUT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL BUT THAT'S CURRENTLY WHERE WE STAND I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS AND IT DOES IT DOES THAT AND MORE.
