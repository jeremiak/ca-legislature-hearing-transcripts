ARMOR GLAD TO REPORT THAT THANKS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ASSURED INVESTMENTS YOU MADE WITH THE GOVERNOR WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS BUILDING OUR WATER RESILIENCE. LAST YEAR YOU ON THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AGREED ON THAT FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. BOTH RESPOND AND IF YOU DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND STRENGTHEN OUR WATER RESILIENCE. AND ADD YOU IDENTIFY YOUR WHITE HOUSE D. THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF APPROPRIATIONS- FOR THIS BUDGET YEAR. YOUR POINT ON ACCOUNT OF I'M REALLY GLAD TO READ THAT ARE DEPARTMENT HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB I WOULD SAY GREAT JOB ARE WORKING TO GET FINDING OUT- MORE QUICKLY OR MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN EVER BEFORE WE HAVE UPWARDS OF EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT REPORT BILLION DOLLARS COMMITTED. HALFWAY THROUGH THE FISCAL YEAR NOW IN THAT REFLECT THE SHARED URGENCY THAT YEAR WHEN THE GOVERNOR HAD DIRECTED FOR US WHICH IS BANNED AS KIND OF RESILIENCE FUNDING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BUT POINT TWO BILLION. REQUIRE AMPLE. AND ALL OUR ROAD MAP WHAT EVERY. WHICH WE CALL WIRING PORTFOLIO. I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS NO SILVER FOR TO CALIFORNIA'S WATER INVESTMENT WHERE WE NEED TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF. REGION ACROSS THE STATE THE BILL THEIR RESILIENCE TO THE WEATHER WATER CHALLENGES RECOGNIZING THAT IT IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. I'M WATER RESILIENCE HAS GIVEN HOW BIG AND DIVERSE ARTS STATE AND- THE INVESTMENT WE'VE MADE THAT WE CAN TO MAKE PUT IT A BETTER TO HANDLE THE DROUGHT THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY AND I SHOULD THEY WERE VERY MUCH PLANNING FOR A THIRD DRY YEAR OF CONTINUED DROUGHT GIVE AND THE LATE WINTER WEATHER. PHOTOGRAPH BETTER POSITION TO PROTECT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FACING WATER RELIABILITY CHALLENGES. PROJECT CAN HELP RECOVER DATA FISHING WILDLIFE AND OF COURSE- THAT BROUGHT HIGHEST PRIORITY ENSURING FADE. DRINKING WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS- I WILL RESULT OF THAT TWENTY ONE I.

SUPPORT THAT ALREADY EXISTS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN. I BELIEVE THAT BLUE OR SHARE ASK ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. LAST WEEK I THOUGHT HUNDRED MILLION OF NEW FOR. BY INCLUDE TO HONOR FIFTEEN DOLLAR CAN. THAT WOULD BE OUR- A PART OF THE BRAIN BUDGET PROCESS. AT THAT POINT WE'LL HAVE A BETTER. OF THE HIGH HOW THE FUNDING BE. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR CONTAINS CAN BE MOST THE FACT TO. PROF INDICATIONS. AS OUR LA OFFICE NOTED BOND USED TO BE DROP RESILIENCE ARE GOOD BAD. EVEN IF THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN TROUT. WE KNOW THE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN YOUR TIME RESPONSE THAT CAN BE.

THANK YOU JAY WHITE HOUSE KEY- AND MEMBERS OF THE- REALLY EVER. THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU TODAY- AND I APPRECIATE. BUT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S REMARKS THAT HE MADE AND ONES YOU GOING TO HEAR. IN A MOMENT I'M FROM CHAD HAVE SAID SECONDS ROSS- REALLY. YOU KNOW AT WE THINK AND KINDA COUNCIL A DEAL WITH WITH MULTI DE AS OF CHANGE THIS IS A THAT. IS FRONT AND CENTER- I READ A PAUL REED THAT JUST OF CAL. ASSOCI THE DROUGHT WE'VE BEEN WE REALLY AS AS SEX YOU CRAVE MENTION. YEAH THE STORM SOME IMPROVED AUDREY OUT- BUT THEN J. HIT AND IT ONE OF THE AND DRIEST MY ON RACHAEL AND- TODAY IN OUR STATE. HERE IS GOING TO BE IN THE MID SEVEN- AND I REALLY POINTS TO JUSTKNOW AFTER. TO DRY A- REVS CURRENT RESERVOIRS IS BELOW. TWENTY NINETY LEVELS CURRENTLY- WHICH REALLY I JUST GO THE NEW FONG WATER CONSERVE. MOST READ THIS ALLOW LEVELS SEVEN. THE REAL TEST- BUST OR COME WILL COME SPRING WHEN CONTROL RESTRICTION LIFTED. AND RESERVOIRS CAN REFILL WITH SNOWMELT RUNOFF- I'M BACK AS AS WE SAW LAST YEAR SOME OF THOSE AND BAMBER LIGHTLY HERE FROM. OTHERS BECAUSE TODAY THAT RUNOFF EFFICIENCY HOW DRY IT AND- YES SOIL IS AND HOW HOT THE AIR IS REALLY HAVE COMPLETELY CHANGED THE MODELS THAT WE HAVE RELIED ON IN. IN TIMES GONE BY SO. WE CAN DEFEND SAY JACK THAT THE WATERS REMAINS UNDER STRESS- AND WEATHER EXTREMES WILL CONTINUE. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE NEED A HUNDRED AND 40% OF AVERAGE PRECIPITATION THIS RAINY SEASON TO GET BACK TO NORMAL IN RESERVOIR STORAGE- AND CLIMATE CHANGES BORDERS INCREASING AND SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY AND BY THE PATENT SO WITH VERY LITTLE PRECIPITATION ON THE HORIZON. THE STATE AND SIERRA SNOWPACK HAS GONE FROM A HUNDRED AND 60% OF AN AVERAGE OF THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY TO JUST BELOW AVERAGE ON SEPARATE FAST- DECEMBER JANUARY AND FEBRUARY I TYPICALLY- THREE WETTEST MONTHS SPENT RIGHT NOW. WE JUST CONTRADICTS HOW THE WEATHER WILL CHANGE HOW MUCH PRECIPITATION WE WILL GET IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND HOW THAT WILL MANIFEST IN OUR RESERVOIRS SO. WE NEED TO USE OUR WATER RESOURCES EFFICIENTLY AND- ONE OF THE BIG MESSAGES I THINK BACK AT SECRETARY ROSS. AND MYSELF IN OLDER PEOPLE YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM TODAY CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE GONNA EMPHASIZES THAT WE NEED TO NORMALIZE- THIS SENSE OF WATER SCARCITY ARE WE KIND OF HAVE GONE FROM THESE BOOMS AND BUSTS WHERE ONE YEAH WE THINK WE'RE GREAT. THE NEXT YEAR WILL BE THAT WE HAVE NO WATER LEFT I'M. SO THIS AS AS THINK HOW PREPARE OF EMERGENCY SO IN A THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS AS- I CAN TO. ISSUE THAT NEEDS YEAR IN YEAR OUT FUNDING YEAR IN YEAR OUT RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST DOING IT ONE YEAH HOPING THE DROUGHTS OF THAT. AND THEN MOVING ON- TO THE NEXT YEAR AND THEN HAVING TO REBUILD. WHEN WE FIND OUT WAY BACK IN DROUGHT SO. AS WE KNOW THESE DRY CONDITIONS INCREASE THE CHALLENGES OF MALE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT STILL STRUGGLE TO GET ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. I'M TO YOUR POINT WE A VERY HE DIDN'T FOR THIS. IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF ACCOUNTABILITY THE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION BAND THAT WE GET EACH YEAR FROM THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND- WE HAVE A FINANCE- AND A PUBLIC PROCESS TO WORK OUT HOW THAT MONEY WILL BE SPENT HOW IT IS BEING SPENT. AND DASHBOARDS. ON THE WEBSITE AT CHASKA WILL HIGHLIGHT. THOSE SAE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER INVESTMENT. INCLUDING CHECK GETTING THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR QUICKLY- SOMETIMES AT TODD IN GOVERNMENT WEEKS REALLY FOCUS ON PRIORITIZING THAT MAKE EACH OTHER MONEY GETS THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THINGS LIKE CONSOLIDATING THOSE SMALL SYSTEMS- ALL THE WAY LOOKING AT THE RIVER JUST PROGRAM- THAT YOU HELPED FUND IN THE LAST BUDGET TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. SMALL SYSTEMS THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE- OF NOT BEING ABLE TO SEVEN CUSTOMERS. I'M BECAUSE OF NON PAYMENT- I SUPPORTED SAYS. AS CHAIR HAS. A GROUP OF MENTIONED NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL MAKES CLEAR THAT WE NEED. AN ALL OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH ADDRESSING OUR CLIMATE PROBLEMS. AND THAT THAT VERY DEFINITIVELY INCLUDES DROUGHT. BUILDING UPON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET INVESTMENT OF FIVE POINT TWO BILLION. THIS BUDGET ADDS ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO SUPPORT. DROUGHT RESILIENCE AND RESPONSIVENESS AND THOSE MONIES WILL PROVIDE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE TO STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES. AND HELP US PROTECT THE FUTURE CRIME AND USED DROUGHT AND FLOOD CONDITIONS. AND A FEW MINUTES- CHESKY BILL WILL HIGHLIGHT THESE INVESTMENTS NOTABLY AT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN A JOINT- CDS EIGHT AT THE TOWN OF WATER RESOURCES DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION. INITIATIVES AS THE GENDER. DESCRIBES THESE FUNDS TO BE USED TO EXPAND AND REGIONAL THANK COUNTY BASED DROUGHT A MAGNITUDE PROGRAMS SUPPORT INTO. AND PERMANENT SOLUTION TO DRINK WATER- AND OUT AND THESE THAT A CAB OF DROUGHT. AND FUNDED PROGRAMS ALSO SUPPORT. WATER SO COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFERED AND ALLOW TO STAR DROUGHT. STILL SUFFERING SOME OF THE YOU KNOW IT FEEL MANY OF THOSE COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THAT THE TROUT AND DID AND WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD THROUGH THE MORTARBOARD AND OTHER AGENCIES PROVIDE PROVIDED CONTINUOUS SUPPORT IN THE INTERVENING YEARS AND SO. JUST END BY SAYING THAT THESE INVESTMENTS THE INCREDIBLY CRITICAL TO OUR RESPONSE AND PREPARATION TOOLS RESILIENCY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND EXTREME WEATHER FLUCTUATIONS- AND SUPER APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. AND HAPPY AT THE END OF TO MANY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES- JOHNSON ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT- SO SECRETARY ROSS- IN OUR OUR DISCUSSION ITEM SHOW THAT OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ASKING FOR IN ADDITION TO THE EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THIS BEING SPENT FROM LAST YEAR'S DEAL. ONLY TWENTY FIVE GO TO. THE SWEET PROGRAM AND THEN ANOTHER FIVE GOES TO YOUR MOBILE IRRIGATION LAPS ON ON CONSERVATION SO- I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO LOOK AT YOUR VIEWS ON THE EXIT ARTISTI ELIA WILL POINT OUT THAT 80% WATER USES FROM AGRICULTURE AND THERE MAY BE. POTENTIAL FOR MORE CONSERVATION WOULDN'T INVESTMENT THERE BUT PLEASE GIVE US A REPORT. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUES TODAY- I'M SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THAT POINT IT'S ACTUALLY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S PROPOSED- IN ADDITION TO THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WITHIN THE- BUDGET AGREEMENT FROM- THIS LAST YEAR THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE NEXT. FISCAL YEAR FOR THE SWEET PROGRAMS ONE OF THE THINGS I DO WANT TO POINT OUT ITS SWEET IS ONE OF OUR FIRST- CLIMATE SMART ACT PROGRAMS THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE LAST ROUND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. SO WE'RE BUILDING ON THE PREVIOUS INVESTMENT TO CONTINUALLY EXPAND ACRES THAT ARE UNDER THE MOST PRECISE IRRIGATION METHODOLOGIES- AND BEING ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH HOW RAPIDLY. AUTOMATION AND INNOVATION IS CHANGING TO IMPROVE EVER MORE THE WAY WE USE WATER IN AGRICULTURE- SHE WENT TO IMPACT. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES OF IMPROVEMENTS AND IRRIGATION AB ACTUALLY RESULTED IN 14% LAST APPLIED WATER 438% MORE CROP PRODUCTIVITY AND VALUE OF THOSE CLOCKS. SO WE KNOW THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WORKS AND I APPRECIATE THE L. A- POINTING OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING TO IMPROVE CONSERVATION AND AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY- THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BUILD ON WHAT WE CHEST- HAVE. BEEN ABLE TO CLOSE THIS YEAR WE HAD AN APPLICATION PERIOD THAT CLOSED ON JANUARY EIGHTEENTH BUT THIS WEEK PROGRAM. WE WILL BE ABLE TO AWARD OVER TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PROJECTS- BUT WE HAD A REQUEST FOR OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PROJECTS SO IT'S STILL A VERY. OVERSUBSCRIBED PROGRAM. IT NOT ONLY READ. WATER YOU. THAT REDUCES ENERGY USE WHICH REDUCES GREENHOUSE AND IT ALSO. IRRIGATION AND I NEW TRIP MANAGED EFFICIENCY. I WANTED THINGS I DID WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS BEING PROPOSED SPECIFICALLY FOR TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND DIRECT MICRO GRANTS TO VERY SMALL FARMERS AND PRIORITY POPULATIONS WHICH ARE. ARE SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS THIS IS BEING PROPOSED- BUILT ON THE SUCCESS OF THE VERY SMALL PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED DURING COPELAND TO ASSIST THIS POPULATION BUT THE DOLLARS TO HELP THEM. SEVEN TO NO MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES. NO BUSINESS PLANNING- AND KEEP THAT FIRE GOING ON VERY VERY SMALL ACREAGE THIS. ASSISTANCE AND DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO OUR SMALL FARMERS WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ON FARM CONSULTATIONS EDUCATION OUT REACH MOBILE LABS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IRRIGATION SYSTEM MAY HAVE IS AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE AND WILL BUILD ON THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT'S AVAILABLE TO HELP THESE FARMERS. APPLIED FORCE WEEK PROGRAM I'M REALLY PLEASED THAT OF THAT OF THE GRANT THAT JUST CLOSED 35% OF THE APPLICANTS THAT THIS CATEGORY PRIORITY POPULATIONS AND SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS. I DO WANT TO JUST CLOSE BY POINTING OUT THAT. BASED ON PRELIMINARY NUMBERS OF DROUGHT IMPACTS IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF OF WATER SHORTAGES IT'S ESTIMATED THERE ARE ABOUT. THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND ACRES OF BALLOT ACRE. ACRES THAT HAVE BEEN BALLOT WHICH WAS IN ALL A DOLLARS IN LOST RATHER. AND SO ONE ON FARMS. SO OUR WORK CHANGE. IT IS DOING A GOOD AND WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THAT SUCCESS OF THE OF THE PROGRAM TO DATE. AND I WOULD NEVER TURN DOWN ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO INVEST IN THE RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY BUT WE FEEL THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS AS THEY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY OUR FARMING COMMUNITY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. I'M SURE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL HAVE A QUESTION OVER THE THREE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS THAT ARE NOT FUNDED WITH THE ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT THAT YOU HAVE BUT- WE'LL GET TO TAP. ALL RIGHT- CHERISHED GIVE ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE MORE THAN A PASSING INTEREST OF THE- HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S TAKEN OUT A CAP AND TRADE OR THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO TAKE OUT A CAP AND TRADE. RATHER THAN YOU KNOW THE MONEY THAT'S COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MONEY THAT'S COMING IN THIS BUDGET THAT WOULD. ALLOW CAP ENTRY TO BE USED FR OTHER WORTHY PROJECTS SO. I'LL LET YOU GIVE YOUR REPORT WITH TASKS- THAT LOOMING IN THE BACK IN THE PACK IN THE- BACKGROUND. APRIL WE SHOULD THAT NOT SURE WHAT BECAUSE AND- NO THE WAS IS A WE HAVE BEEN A OPPORTUNITY DO IT IS THREE WATER CLIMB AT IN A WAY THAT IS VERY RE I KNOW FOR MANY SIR THIS PASS YEAR AS WE HAD TO RISK TO A CAN THROUGH THE STATE AND MANY COMMUNITIES- LAST LEVEL THINK WE HAVE TO BE MIND THAT WE MOST RECENTLY JUST WENT THROUGH- AN INCREDIBLE PROUD OF RECORD- THE HEIGHT OF WHICH WITHIN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN SO VERY RECENTLY- AND WHAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY IS THE BENEFIT OF A LOT OF- CONTINUE ON THE PATH FOR. FROM THAT TIME- I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT ACTUALLY THE STATE WATER BOARD SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN HAS BEEN ABLE TO INVEST NEARLY TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE- THAT IMPACT INCLUDES LOANS AND GRANTS FROM THE MAJOR STATE REVOLVING LOAN- PROJECTS- THE CLEAN WATER SRF AND THE DRINKING WATER SRF BUT ALSO PROP ONE BOND DOLLARS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THERE- THAT ARE CRITICALLY GOING INTO AND CREATING A RESILIENCY TO DROUGHT NOW AS WE'VE JUST WENT AGAIN THROUGH THIS LAST YEAR- SO- I THINK THAT WHAT YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE AND MAKE NOTE OF HERE IS THAT. WE ARE NEEDING TO CONTINUE TO PREPARE FOR DRY CONDITIONS THIS SUMMER- YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF IS BEING ABLE TO TOGGLE ON AND OFF DROUGHT OR FLOOD I INVESTMENT SO WE'RE NEEDING TO BE MAKING IN OUR SYSTEMS AND INSTEAD IT'S REALLY BAD AS SECRETARY. PROFIT SAID ALLISTER VIEW OF THE CHAO THAT COME CHANGE UP ON A WILL SYSTEM. AND YES THE STATE AND AFFORDABLE FUNDED ONE. OF WHAT IS THAT TEN BILL DOLLARS. OVER THE LAST YEARS. I IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WE'RE IN THE SECOND. WE'VE NOW GONE THROUGH TWO YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT. AND ARE VERY PROUD ACTUALLY OF WHAT THIS INVESTMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ALLOW US TO DO. AND REALLY BRIDGING THE GAP EQUITY GAP DISTRICT. AND YOU KNOW EXISTED FOR DECADES IN OUR COMMUNITIES- TED TED TED NOT JUST RESPOND TO DROUGHT. BUT TO RESPOND TO THE MANY OTHER STRESSORS THAT I KNOW OUR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS BASED INCLUDING. FORCING CONTAMINANTS. ARE EMERGING CONTAMINANTS OF CONCERN LIKE P. FAST ALL THINGS THAT REALLY ARE STRESS THE AFFORDABILITY OF OUR WATER SYSTEMS. AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS AND WAYS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BE VERY MINDFUL OF- BUT HERE TALKING ABOUT TRUMP AND OUR ARE DROWNING VESTMENTS- AGAIN I'M PROUD THAT IT'S A CONTINUAL LOVE OF EFFORT HERE. KNOWING THAT- THERE'S ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS WE CURRENTLY HAVE- OUGHT. FOR PROVIDING I HOLD WATER TOO BECAUSE OF DRY WELLS FROM THIS LAST SUMMER AND FROM EVEN UP. SOME WELLS FROM FROM PREVIOUS- TROUT WHERE WERE WERE- REALLY FORTUNATE FOR THE- D. V. COLLABORATION AT THAT WE HAVE WITH SELF HELP ENTERPRISES. WHICH WAS REALLY DEVELOPED IN THE LAST DROUGHT IN HERE A LOT. TO RESPOND QUICKLY- IN THE FACE OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING CONDITIONS THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS- CURRENTLY MONTHLY. ARE EXPENDABLE A MILLION DOLLARS NEARLY- IN THE PROVISION OF ALL WATER SO. WE HAVE TO BE VERY MINDFUL. THAT BETTER THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT- MAINLY DOMESTIC WELLS IN STATE SMALLS- BUT IT'S A CONTINUUM OF RESPONSE TO OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE. YOU HAVE TO MISTER WELLS YEP STATES FALLS. AND THEN YOU HAVE LARGER SYSTEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ALSO RESPOND TO. AND THEY'RE THANKFUL FOR THE- COORDINATION THAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES. WHERE WHERE. WHERE BEING MINDFUL. IT'S NOT JUST ALL THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE. THAT HAVE AS WE ALSO DRAW DOLLARS THAT YOU TO YOU ARE WE ALSO HAVE THESE LAW PROBE. THAT WITH MY PART INTEREST LAW- COMING DOWN THE LINE WORKS TO RECEIVE BILLION OF DOLLARS FROM THE FIVE GOVERNMENT. TO IN OUR DRINKING SYSTEM INVEST ARE WASTE SYSTEM. AND CONTINUE AND HERE YOU KNOW THE BUT THOSE. WATER RECYCLING AS WELL- WHICH IS SUCH A GREAT COME. OF OUR RESPONSE FOR AT LARGE- TO DROUGHT SO THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT ASKING FOR AN EMERGENCY DROUGHT RESPONSE WILL ALLOW US TO AGAIN EXPAND. THIS PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE HERE MAINLY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THROUGH SELF HELP. AND OTHER- LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS IT REALLY HELPED EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES- ARE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO DRY. AND HERE WE CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT. OUR DROUGHT RESPONSE COVERS NOT JUST. THAT DRINKING WATER SIDE BUT ALSO- AT THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL AS WE ADMINISTER WATER RIGHTS- AND THEY'RE PROUD OF THEFACT THAT. HERE THE STATE BOARD THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY IT IS ACTIVELY ADMINISTERING- WATER RIGHTS WERE LOOKING AT'S WHAT'S HYDROLOGICALLY AVAILABLE WE'RE MATCHING UP WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS. THAT THE DIVERSIONS AND PRIORITY OF. THE BURGERS AND WATERSHED. AND CURTAILING AS NEEDED GIVEN THE INCREDIBLE DROUGHT CONDITIONS THAT THAT WE HAVE. THAT IS ACTUALLY STE THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ACTIVELY DOING THAT- AND SO I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S BEEN. A VERY DIFFICULT YEAR FOR A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES- IN THE STATE BUT- COORDINATING HERE WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO S. SECRETARY ROSS SAID. REALLY BE ABLE TO FILL THE NEED- BUT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THE SUMMER WILL BRING. AND HERE I CONTINUE TO PLAN FOR WORST CASE SCENARIOS THERE. SO THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU- BUT MOVE TO OUR NEXT NEXT GUEST THAT WOULD BE A THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER ARE RESEARCH WE HAVE TO. AND NAME IT ARGENTINA MATH. GOOD MORNING AT CHEROKEE SKI A NAY MISS- LIKE JONI THAT'S ALL I'M REAL I MUST BE OLDER A LOT OF PEOPLE AT ME LIKE WHO HECK WAS. RODWAY GEO FOR SOME. IT'S I HONORED TO BE THIS TO YOU ALL- AND WORK- THAT COW IS TO SOME OUR CA- DURING THIS YEAR OF DROUGHT- AS THE SO SPOKESMAN- THIS IS- CERTAIN A THIRD YEAR OF DROUGHT THE DROUGHT IS NOT OVER- BY ANY STRETCH AND NOT ONLY IS IT NOT OVER I THINK WE'VE WE'VE EXPERIENCED- THE WEATHER WHIPLASH THAT CREATES A LOT OF CHALLENGES AROUND- HOW WE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. ALSO IN MY VIEW OFFERS A DEGREE OF- HOPE THAT IF WE DO THE RIGHT THINGS AND MAKE THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS- OUR COMMUNITIES CAN BECOME DROUGHT RESILIENCE AND REALLY WEATHERED THESE VERY INTENSE PERIODS WHICH WE ANTICIPATE- COMING MORE FREQUENTLY AND LASTING LONGER- BERMAN. OFFERS OF ALL OVER OUR FOR- GIVE YOU AN UP. AS TO WHERE WE ARE- YOUR COMMENTS. ABOUT THE KIND OF- WE HAVE THREE. GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON- THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THEIR SUPPORT IN THE PREVIOUS- BUDGET CYCLE- THOSE ARE SMALL COMMUNITIES ARE URBAN AND MULTI BENEFIT- PROJECTS AND THEN PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT A BETTER GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT. SO FOR OUR SMALL COMMUNITIES AS THE OTHER PRESENTERS HAVE MENTIONED TYPICALLY IN DROUGHT IT REALLY IS OUR SMALL COMMUNITIES RURAL AREAS THAT EXPERIENCED. THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY IN CLEAN WATER. AT THE LEGISLATURE HAVE PASSED THE SENATE BILL FIVE FIVE TWO WHICH DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT TO ESTABLISH A TASK FORCE- IN CONJUNCTION WITH STYLE STAKEHOLDERS FROM SMALL COMMUNITIES. TO HELP US ESTABLISH A PATH FORWARD FOR INVESTING SO THAT IS THAT IS HAPPENING BUT IT IS NOT SLOWING DOWN THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO RELATIVE TO GRANT MAKING- AND THAT IS BASED ON- IMPORTANT REPORTING THAT WE'VE DONE- IN THAT WE DID TO THE LEGISLATURE OUT LAST YEAR LAST MARCH WHICH ESTABLISHED THEY ARE A LOOK. AT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE SO WITH THAT AS A ROAD MAP IS THE DEPARTMENT HAS- EXPENDED ABOUT NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE PREVIOUS BUDGET- WE'VE MADE FIFTY GRANTS- TO WORTHY PROJECTS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE ANTICIPATE- SPENDING THE REMAINDER OF THOSE DOLLARS IN TWO ROUNDS OF GRANTS ONCE IN MARCH AND. ANOTHER IN APRIL SO WE DO YOU AND- THAT- TO HAVE MILLION THAT WAS APPROPRIATED BY THE- IN THE LAST BUDGET WILL BE COME. DISTRIBUTED OUT BY THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR- OR THE URBAN AND- A MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS BUT I SHOULD SAY FOR THE SMALLS OF SMALL PROJECTS ARE SMALL COMMUNITIES WE HAVE RECEIVED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS- OF REQUESTS TO DATE. SO WE DEFINITELY KNOW THAT THERE IS A REAL NEED OUT THERE FOR QUALITY PROJECTS TO FUND. FOR OUR URBAN AND MULTI BENEFIT PROGRAM THAT IS TRAILING BEHIND FOR A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT REASONS. WE HAVE MADE- GRANTS TO TWENTY FIVE PROJECTS FOR ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WE ANTICIPATE ANOTHER ROUND OF GRANTS IN MARCH THAT WILL BE MUCH BIGGER- WE DID RECEIVE ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN REQUEST IN OUR FIRST FELICITATION- WHAT'S BEHIND THAT THOUGH I THINK THERE ARE SOME PROJECTS THAT. THAT WERE ELIGIBLE AND PART OF THE REASON THEY WEREN'T ELIGIBLE IS THERE WASN'T THAT READINESS- BY THE WATER DISTRICTS TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATION. PAST TWO MONTHS WE MADE THAT FIRST ROUND IN DECEMBER ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS IS WORKING WITH THOSE FOLKS- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR- THEIR APPLICATIONS ARE COMPLETE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE YEAH- ACTUALLY MAKE MORE GRANT AWARDS. THIS MARCH AND WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT FUNDING WILL WILL BE PART OF THIS NEXT ROUND OF GRANTS- FOR BOTH THE SMALL. COMMUNITY GRANT PROGRAM WE ARE WORKING INTENSELY WITH OUR TRIBAL NATION PARTNERS- WE HAVE ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND A GRANT APPLICATIONS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WITH TRIBAL NATIONS THAT FIT INTO THAT SMALL COMMUNITY CATEGORY AND THEN FOR OUR URBAN A MULTI BENEFITS WE A PROGRAM WE HAVE SET ASIDE ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO ADDRESS NEEDS AN UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES- AGAIN OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT FOR THOSE TWO GRANT PROGRAMS I'M D. W. R. WILL HAVE ALL THOSE GRANT MONIES BY THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR. FOR SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER- JUST THIS BUDGET REQUEST INCLUDES- ANOTHER SET OF FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS THAT FOCUSED OR PROJECTS THAT FOCUS ON GROUNDWATER RECHARGE- A COUPLE IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS COMPLETED- WHAT WE CALL FLYOVER- WE- THE INTERESTED- TECH- WHERE WE ACTUALLY MEASURE- SOILS. FROM FROM HELICOPTERS AND WE CAN'T THAT HELPS US IDENTIFY THE PLACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE THE MOST SUITABLE CONDITIONS FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WE HAVE THAT DATA- THAT WORK WAS DONE OVER THE SUMMER THAT WAS VERY MUCH IN FORM- OUR GRANT MAKING IN THIS SPACE. BECAUSE WE KNOW GROUND WATER RECHARGE IS GOING TO BE ESSENTIAL IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IN CALIFORNIA TO BRING GROUNDWATER BASINS INTO SUSTAINABILITY BUT IS IT IS ONE REAL CRUCIAL PILLAR- AND SO ARE OUR BUDGET. REQUEST THIS YEAR INCLUDES ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO HELP SUPPORT THOSE KINDS OF GRANT APPLICATIONS THEY WILL BE COMING FROM THE LOCAL GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY pPLANS. THE DEPARTMENT- AS YOU MAY BE AWARE- THE DEPARTMENT. HAD EARLY DEADLINES FOR OUR CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED GROUNDWATER BASINS LARGELY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT OTHER PLACES ALONG THE COAST. WE HAVE RECEIVED ALL OF THOSE PLANS ARE THE DEPARTMENT HAS- RENDERED ITS JUDGMENT AS TO THE ADEQUACY OF THOSE PLANS. BUT THE IMPORTANT POINT THERE IS. AFTER THOSE PLANS ARE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT THEY ARE SELF IMPLEMENTING AND SO WE DO HAVE A- A REAL PIPELINE IF YOU WILL OF- OF PROJECTS THAT NEED TO BE ADVANCED THROUGH THIS KIND OF. FUNDING PROGRAM I'M SO THAT'S WHERE D. W. R. IS WITH OUR OUR GRANT DOLLARS TO DATE- WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE OTHER IMPORTANT REQUEST A BUDGET REQUEST. ONE IS FOR CONSERVATION AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED. WE HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. REQUESTED FOR OUR URBAN- WATER AGENCIES TO DO MORE WITH WHAT USE- THERE'S A OF RIGHT NOW ON PAYERS AND THE- BEHIND THIS PROGRAM IS- ESPECIALLY SOME OF OUR LARGER URBAN WATER DISTRICTS- THEY DO HAVE IDEAS THAT WE THINK ARE- OUR NOVEL. AND THAT ARE ONES THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVELY SEED MONEY IF YOU WILL FOR IDEAS THAT WE CAN- WE CAN EVENTUALLY TAKE TO SCALE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR OUR SMALL DISTRICTS WE DO HAVE TWENTY FOUR OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM REQUEST IN FOR US SMALL WATER AGENCIES TO ALSO DO THAT- IMPORTANT CONSERVATION WORK. AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST IN A FOR. A TURF REMOVAL PROGRAMS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DID IN THE PREVIOUS DOUGHT- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD DO IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH WATER DISTRICTS WHO ALSO HAVE. THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS UP AND RUNNING AS WE MOVE INTO A THIRTY YEAR OF DROUGHT. AND THEN LASTLY I WOULD SAY- TO YOUR TO YOUR EARLIER POINT TO SECRETARY ROSS ABOUT AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION- DO KNOW THAT- I AM WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COMMISSIONER OF THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION. ABOUT FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THESE VALLEY PROJECT AND ITS WATER CONTRACTORS ARE PREDOMINANTLY AGRICULTURAL CONTRACTORS TO PARTICULARLY DURING DROUGHT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES PLAY A ROLE IN HELPING US TO REDUCE AGRICULTURAL WATER USAGE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH SECRETARY ROSS AND OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS BOTH WITH THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION AND- US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON THESE IMPORTANT TOPICS HERE TODAY AND- I CERTAINLY. YOU YOU LAB CLEAR I THE- FOR I'M GETTING DOLLARS THE DOOR- AS I WITH ALL DELIBERATE SPEED PARTICULAR. IN THE CONTEXT OF. THE DROUGHT EMERGENCY THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU AND WE WILL BE ASKING ONCE WE GO THROUGH ALL THAT ALEJO WILL BE ASKING. EACH OF YOU ABOUT THE- THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION THAT IT'S COMING TO CALIFORNIA ON WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN IN THE COMPETITIVE MONEY THERE WAS. SILENCE ON YOU KNOW WITH THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE COMPETITIVE- IN THE IN THE WATER AREA THAT ON THE NATURAL WE GET BUDGET REQUEST THAT YOU'RE MAKING THE ADDITIONAL QUESTION MAKING NOW. WE'VE BEEN TO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PROPOSING MORE YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE STRONG AS IN EACH YEAR DEPARTMENTS ARE YOUR AGENCIES TO COMPETE WITH THAT BUT- I DON'T WANT TO GET A HEAD OF US MYSELF AND I'M- GOING TO GO TO THE FISH AND WILDLIFE. SUPPORT AND DIRECTOR BOTTOM- I WILL NOTE THAT ON OUR LITTLE SHEET THAT WE HAVE YOU'RE- THIRTY TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED. THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MEDIA TROUT SUPPORT OVER TWENTY EIGHT MILLION HAS ALREADY GONE OUT THE DOOR AS WELL AS THE EIGHTEEN MILLION THAT WE HAD FOR- HERE DEPARTMENT IN A NON GRANT OFFERINGS YOU'VE GOT FOR ALMOST FIFTEEN MILLION OF THE EIGHTEEN MILLION THERE SO. EVIDENTLY IF WE GIVE YOU MONEY YOU WILL SPEND THAT- BUT GO AHEAD YOU HAVE YOUR REPORT. CAN CAN CONFIRM TWO THINGS CHAIR YES IF MONEY IS ALLOCATED WE WILL SPEND A PROBABLY TWO GOOD RESULTS AND SECOND. IN COMPARISON TO THE LAST- MOST MAJOR DROUGHT TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN BACK THEN I WOULD ARGUE THE STATE CARRIED MUCH LARGER ROLE RELATIVE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS SUFFERING A DIFFERENT BUDGET DYNAMIC THEN WE NOW FIND OURSELVES IN. TWENTY TWENTY TO WEAR DIRECTOR NEMETH IN THE SECRETARIES ARE WORKING HARD TO ENSURE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTES IN THIS SPACE AND A MATCHING STYLE WITH THE STATE. FROM THERE THANK YOU CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHUCK BONHAM ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. IN FIVE MINUTES OR LESS I'D LIKE TO MAKE FOUR MAIN POINTS ABOUT OUR PROPOSAL. THE FIRST POINT IS IT'S A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE OUR DEPARTMENT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS SURGICALLY PLANNED IT'S ARGUED IT TO ACTIONS WHICH FOR TO PRODUCE RETURNS. IT'S SPECIFIC THESE ARE ACTIONS YOU CAN MEASURE THE RESULTS OF. IN IN A BROADER CONTEXT IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE SMALLER AMOUNTS WITHIN THE TOTAL DROUGHT PROPOSAL ARE YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. IT ALSO ACCOMPLISHES A PARALLEL OBJECTIVE THAT I THINK YOU AND I SHARE. AS YOU KNOW YOU HAD OUR DEPARTMENT WORKING ON SERVICE BASED BUDGETING FOR MANY YEARS I SUBMITTED A REPORT LAST YEAR WHICH ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION RESPONSIBILITIES AND CURRENT CAPACITY IS A LARGE GAP. ONE WAY TO SOLVE THAT GAP IS TO DO ONE TIME INVESTMENTS IN EQUIPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO MODERNIZE AND GET US CLOSER TO DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO. SECOND POINT THIS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIS PROPOSED FOLLOWS YOUR LEAD LAST YEAR YOUR LEADERSHIP WORKING WITH THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR PRODUCED A COMMITMENT OF FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO OUR DEPARTMENT FOR DROUGHT RELIEF WE'RE SPENDING IT WISELY WE HAVE IT ON A TRANSPARENCY KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY SPREADSHEET THEY WERE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ON AND THE FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR IS THE TEMPLATE FOR WHAT WE WOULD DO WITH THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN THIS YEAR. THIRD POINT THESE ARE GOOD THINGS THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS REALLY GOES TO THESE CORE AREAS THERE'S IMMEDIATE MITIGATION NEED WE DO TRANSLOCATIONS OF ANIMALS THAT ARE THREATENED BY DRYING LANDSCAPES WE GO OUT AND RESCUE ANIMALS BETTER IN HARM'S WAY BECAUSE RIVERS AND CREEKS AND WETLANDS ARE DRAMATICALLY SHRINKING. WE BRING THESE ANIMALS IN MANY CASES INTO A NO WAS ARC OF OUR OWN FACILITIES THE UC SYSTEM'S ALL THE ZOOS AND AQUARIA. SAVE THEM FROM DROUGHT AND THEN REINTRODUCE THEM BACK TO NATURE WHEN IT'S WHETHER. WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER ON VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS WORKING WITH WATER USERS TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO BALANCE USE THE WATER FOR WINEGROWING. AND TO SAVE SAM PROJECTS REALLY GOOD EXAMPLES INCLUDE IN THE SCOTT RIVER IN THE KLAMATH WORKING WITH THREE MAIN GROUNDWATER PUMPERS. COMPENSATE THEM FOR BEARING THEIR PUMPING THIS YEAR WHICH ARGUABLY SAVED BECAUSE SALMON IN THE SCOTT RIVER. AND THIS IMMEDIATE MITIGATION OF FORTY SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION A SUB PART OF THE SEVENTY FIVE HELPS U WITH WILDLIFE HUMAN CONFLICTS TAKE THE TAHOE BASIN EXAMPLE. IT'S A MASHUP OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS BEARS THAT ARE NO LONGER HIBERNATING AND INTERFACING ONE OF THE MOST TOURIST DRIVEN SPOTS ON THE PLANET. AND WE ARE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICTS A YEAR THIS IMMEDIATE MITIGATION MONEY LETS US MANAGE THAT DYNAMIC BETTER. SECOND MANDATORY IMPROVE RESILIENCY OF THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION WOULD GO TO IMPROVING OUR OWN STATE LANDS. A GREAT EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WE'VE JUST DONE. FORECAST WHAT WE WOULD DO IS THAT ARE ASKED WILDLIFE AREA UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WORKING WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFALL. WE WENT OUT TO REPLACE FAILING WATER CONTROL STRUCTURES. ARE ADJACENT MANAGED WETLAND UNITS REPAIRED HOLES SYSTEMS SETBACK CERTAIN WETLAND UNITS ALL FOR THE BENEFIT A WATERFALL IN WATER USE EFFICIENCY ON OUR LAND LINE. ANOTHER WAY. WE DO THIS WORK IS ON PRIVATE LANDS. JUST THIS PAST YEAR WHICH WE REPORT ON IN WHICH FORECAST WHAT WILL DO IN THE DAYS AHEAD. WHEN WE ENTERED INTO PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE RICE COMMISSION AND LANDOWNERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OF BIRD RETURNS WHERE WE COMPENSATE FARMERS TO FLOOD THEIR FIELDS IN WILDLIFE FRIENDLY WAYS THE SUPPORT SURE BOARDS AND WATERFALLS AND LISTS OF REQUIREMENTS. LET AREA THE SQUARE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. HATCHERIES AND FISH PRODUCTION. LAST YEAR WE PICKED UP AND MOVED OFF ALMOST SEVENTEEN MILLION SALMON FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY HATCHERIES DOWN INTO THE COASTAL ESTUARIES SO THAT WE WOULD IMPROVE THEIR SURVIVAL CHANCE. WE NEED TO DO THAT SAME THING AGAIN THIS COMING YEAR. AND WHAT WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO DO WHICH FORECAST WHAT WE WOULD DO IS BEGIN TO MODERNIZE ALL OF OUR HATCH. TO GIVE YOU A QUICK. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF REPLACING ALMOST A HUNDRED HATCHERY FLEET ASSETS FISH STOCKING TRUCKS TRAILERS VEHICLES. PICKUP TRUCKS GETTING MODERN HIGH CAPACITY TRIPLOID EXHORTING MACHINES. ALL OF WHICH ARE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS THAT ALSO FIX OUR S. B. B. CHALLENGES ON OUR GAP. SO THOSE ARE THE THREE REASONS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SURGICAL FOLLOWS YOUR LEAD FROM LAST YEAR. TO DO MORE GOOD THINGS HERE'S MY FOURTH AND FINAL POINT. WHEN YOU CONSIDER SEVENTY FIVE MILLION BASED ON THOSE THREE POINTS THE FINAL POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS ALL OF THIS WORK IS REALLY. THE FIGHT EXTINCTION. AND SIGNATURE AND IT SEEMS LIKE A PRUDENT AND MORE TO LAST MINUTE THE SCALE SEVENTY FIVE NINE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND I THINK THE NEXT ONE OF THE MANY SPEAKERS NEXT IN THE QUEUE IS DAVID CHIU BASIN. OKAY LET'S LET'S GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND WE HAVE- DIRECTOR SHOULD BOSNIAN GOOD GOOD MORNING DOT AND YOU'VE GOT THE- I JUST HAD IT HERE SECOND. THEY EVER CHANGING RIVER- COMMENTED UPON YOUR GATED PLAN REPURPOSE SING FORTY BILLION DOLLARS I SEE THE ALEJO AND STAFFERS COMMENTS ON THAT WE'LL GET INTO THAT LATER BUT PLEASE. FORGIVE ENTERED NOW. WELL THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- YES I'M PRESENTING THIS MORNING ON THE BUDGET REQUEST FOR- THAT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A SECOND ROUND OF FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S MULTI BENEFIT LAND REPURPOSE IN PROGRAM. SO LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDED THE FIRST APPROPRIATION OF FIFTY MILLION FOR THIS PROGRAM AND I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW TIMELY AND IMPORTANT THIS PROGRAM IS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS THAT WERE SEEN FROM. THE LOSS OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION DUE TO- REDUCED GROUNDWATER SUPPLY AS WE DEAL WITH THE ONGOING DROUGHT AND SEGMENTATION AFFECTS THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY BUT ALSO THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE AGRICULTURE REALLY IS THAT. A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF JOBS AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THOSE AREAS. SO TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THIS ISSUE THAT THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA ESTIMATES THAT BETWEEN HALF A MILLION TO A MILLION ACRES OF LAND WILL BE FOLLOWED DUE TO REDUCED GROUNDWATER AVAILABILITY. SO THIS IS A CRITICAL TOOL TO HELP REGION'S BRING THEIR GROUNDWATER BASINS INTO A SUSTAINABLE BALANCE- THE EMPHASIS WILL BE ON PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ADDRESS OTHER RE PURPOSING PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BY- BY THOSE REGIONS- AND I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS ABOUT EMPOWERING REGIONS TO REALLY. DETERMINE WHAT THEIR FUTURE IS AND TO DEVELOP THOSE STRATEGIES SO THE FUNDING WILL PROVIDE FUNDS TO REGIONAL ENTITIES. THAT WELL CONVENE VOLUNTARY LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS WHO WILL BE TASKED VAN WITH A DEVELOPING THEIR STRATEGIES THAT IDENTIFIES THE REDUCE OPTIONS FOR THESE LANDS THAT MAKE UP SHALLOW- AND THAT CAN NO LONGER BE IRRIGATED- SO THE PROJECTS THAT WE- WE THINK WILL BE RESULTING FROM THE STRATEGIES WILL DRIVE TOWARD OUTCOMES THAT IMPROVES. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT- THE ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES AND AS WELL AS ECONOMIC. WELL BEING IN THESE IN THESE AREAS- SO IT'S THROUGH THE AGAIN THIS REGIONAL APPROACH TO THE PROBE AND POWER LEADERS FROM BOTH THOSE YOU KNOW THE LANDSCAPE THE FARMERS AND RANCHERS THE TRIBES. AND THOSE WHO WILL FACE THE MOST IMPACT FROM THESE LANDS GOING SHALLOW AND THEN BEING REPURPOSED. FIVE SO WE ARE OUT TO ADVANCE THIS WORK WE ARE CONVENE AN INTERAGENCY GROUP WE HAVE CONVENE AN INTERAGENCY GROUP OF ADVISORS- AND THEY'RE HELPING US IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM ARM IN ARM SO WE ARE WORKING WITH STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT INTERSECTS. ARE ON THESE ISSUES THAT ARE THAT ARE GOING TO BE CHALLENGES GOING FORWARD AND IN THESE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT SO WHAT WHAT WHAT HAVE THIS AGRICULTURAL. PRODUCTION AS MUCH AS IT HAS TODAY- THERE IS A TREMENDOUS INTEREST OF COURSE AND NEED FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND FRANKLY TO BE TO CANDID YEAH LOOKING THAT. SCALE THE PROBLEM WITH THE REALITY THAT THIS IS A WHOLE NEW FIELD OF WORK. SO WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO BOTH MOVE QUICKLY AND MAKE RESOURCES AVAILABLE. TO MEET THE REGIONAL NEEDS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE STRUCTURED WE HAVE BEEN PUSHING HARD ON OUTREACH- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THOSE NEEDS THAT ARE OUT THERE FOR THESE SERVICES IN FOR THIS PROGRAM. I THAT THOSE PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT SO WE HAVE PUBLISHED OR DRAFT GUIDELINES AND WE HAD A TWO MONTH COMMENT PERIOD ON THOSE. AND THEN WE'VE HELD COURT FOR PUBLIC WORKSHOPS THREE TRIBAL ONLY WORKSHOPS AND HAVE PRESENTED AT. NUMEROUS PUBLIC MEETINGS AND CONFERENCES LIKE THOSE HOSTED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF. CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES IN THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT. AND SO WITH ALL OF THIS AND BUT WE WILL BE RELEASING THE FINAL GUIDELINES AND R. F. P. THIS MONTH. AND WE EXPECT TO BE MAKING AWARDS FOR THIS PROGRAM IN MAY. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BASED ON THE INTEREST IN THE FEEDBACK THAT WE- ARE GETTING THAT WE EXPECT TO BE OVERSUBSCRIBED FOR THIS FIRST ROUND. WHICH WILL DISTRIBUTE THE ENTIRE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- AND WE EXPECT THAT IT'S LIKELY- IF WE GET FUNDING IN THIS ROUND THAT THAT WILL ALSO BE OVERSUBSCRIBED. SO I APPRECIATE A CHANCE TO DESCRIBE THIS PROGRAM AND I KNOW WE'RE PROBABLY MOVING TO QUESTIONS I'M GLAD TO ANSWER THOSE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. COMMITTEE HAS A RICH HISTORY OF ASKING QUESTIONS BUT- BEFORE WE GET THERE I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO TO THE ALEJO AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. LET'S PAINT A BIGGER PICTURE NOW OKAY WE JUST HEARD FROM YOUR AGENCIES IN YOUR SECRETARIES WE'VE GOT. THREE POINT THREE MILLION THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY ON WHAT HAPPENED WORST WORST THE MONEY'S GOING ON WE GOT ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT YOU WANT TO GO NGUYEN. SIMULTANEOUSLY WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THREE POINT SIX BILLION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IS COMING AND WE'RE GUARANTEED TO GET SIX HUNDRED. FIFTY MILLION BUT- UNDER MY COUNTY. WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE. CLOSE TO THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN COMPETITIVE GRANTS THAT'S UP FOR GRABS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT INCLUDES SEVENTEEN BILLION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO SO I'M NOT GOING TO. LAY DOWN ON YOU BUT SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION ISN'T WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ON PILOT PROGRAMS FOR WATER STORES. DATA SHARING LEAD SAFE DRINKING WATER SEWAGE OVERFLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY IS FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION THAT INCLUDES. THREE POINT FIVE FOR FLOOD MITIGATION ASSISTANCE SO CAN YOU GIVE THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. SOME FLAVOR OF WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WITH ALL THE- INTERAGENCY DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU HAVE ON SORT OF ON THE NATURAL WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET WHY DO THE BUDGET. REQUEST YOU MAKE NOW ARE A- BEAUTIFUL PAIRING WHAT WHAT WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHY YOU KNOW. AND WHY YOU'RE ASKING I JUST WE JUST HAD. THE PROPER CONSERVATION THEY HAD TWO. MILLION DOLLARS AT SORT OF A BLOCK GRANT TO GIFTS OF SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THEY CAN THEY CAN MOVE MONEY AROUND AT THESE THAT THAT WERE APPROPRIATE. ADD THAT TO JUST YOUR REGULAR. REQUIRE IN. ARE RELEASE. IF YOU MAY. WE'LL DO THANK YOU CHAIR I CAN MORNING SURE NUMBERS- BRYAN FULLER DEPARTMENT FINANCE- I WILL KIND OF GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CONTEXTUALIZING THIS YEAR'S PACKAGE WITH THEM THE MORE RECENT ESTIMATES THAT YOU ALLUDED TO CHAIR AND I'LL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE ON ON KIND OF SOME OF THE OVER ARCHING COMMENTS AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE POTENTIAL FEDERAL INVESTMENTS M. BUT FIRST JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK AT ADDITIONAL POINTS TO HIGHLIGHT REGARDING THIS YEAR'S DROUGHT RESILIENCE IN RESPONSE PACKAGE WE REALLY ONE UNDERSCORE THESE INVESTMENTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF LAST YEAR'S HISTORIC. WATER RESILIENCE IN DROUGHT PACKAGE WHICH DID PROVIDE FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS TO SUPPORT OF THE MEDIA DROUGHT RESPONSE AND LONG TERM WATER RESILIENCE MEASURES PACKAGE TAKES A MORE APPROACH PROVIDING A MIX OF INVESTMENTS THAT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT IS REQUIRED. TO ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN WATER RESULTS. AS TECH PROGRAM MENTIONED THE TOP. ADMINISTRATION CAN TO ALLOW. THESE PROPOSED INVEST WITH THE GOVERNOR'S WATER RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO INCLUDING PROPOSED FUNDING FOR WATER CONSERVATION SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT. AND MULTI BENEFIT LETTER PURPOSING AMONG OTHER PROPOSED THE BEST. INVESTMENTS WILL BOLSTER THE STATE'S DROUGHT RESILIENCE IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM AND WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER PROVIDE THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH NECESSARY TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S WATER MANAGEMENT MEETS. UP FROM MY COLLEAGUES AFTER A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION REGARDING. THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING THANK YOU. YES GOOD MORNING CARE MEMBERS OR DRIVE OVER THE PART OF FINANCE- IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE MONITORING THERE IS. SOME FUNDING THAT WE ALREADY KNOW FOR SURE IF THEN I GOT THE CALIFORNIA I THOUGHT AS A COUPLE HUNDRED. STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD- THERE'S CLOSE TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING OVER FIVE YEARS OR THANK YOU WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO WE KNOW FROM FROM THE WATER BOARD IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FALLING BEHIND THAT. AND I RESET- AND I'LL- BET ON THE OVERALL- DRINKING WATER- INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONAL NEED THAT. THE THAT THEY NEED ARE ARE GREAT AND SO EVEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW ALMOST FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT. IS GOING TO COME FROM PROGRAM RAN OVER NEXT. FIVE YEARS WHICH IS IN ADDITION TO THE ONE POINT THREE THAT AT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED FROM THE GENERAL FUND LAST YEAR- WE KNOW WE KNOW THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE. A PROPERTY AS THOUGH. THAT THE STATE BUDGET YOU KNOW WILL BE AUGMENTED BY THAT FEDERAL FUNDING. NOW THERE'S A LOT OF- OTHER POP THE FUNDING THAT. ARE STILL A LITTLE BETTER KNOWN- WHERE THEY'RE STILL DISHING THE GUY WAS. GOING TO BE COMING OUT FROM THE GET FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY'RE STILL UNDER G. AS YOU. ARE HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO GET. THE BUDGET DOES PROPOSE THE CONTROL. AND THAT THANKS EIGHT POINT SEVEN. THAT WE'RE- BROKE BEING- YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORITY THAT THE EXTENT THERE IS- KIND OF AND I KNOW. THAT THEY- SPEAK MATCHING. FOR SOME OF THESE. GRANTS THAT HEN WE NEED APPLY. THAT DOES PROVIDE B. ADMINISTRATION I'M ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC. TO BE ABLE THAT- YOUR USE GENERAL ONE IN THERE ARE OTHER FUNDING FOR THE VEIL. TO BE ABLE. TO LEVERAGE THOSE COMPUTER. AFTERWARD WE'RE GONNA BE. DILIGENTLY THE DEPARTMENT LIVING INSPIRATION. TO MATCH YOUR REQUIREMENTS SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE MONITORING BUT WE'RE ALREADY PROPOSING. YOU KNOW WITHIN THAT CONTROL SECTION- RIGHT NOW DOING THIS IS GONNA BE JUST BEING A WATER BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER. ACROSS THE KIND OF BIG BUDGET BACK. POTENTIALLY GET COMPLIMENTED- WITH FEDERAL FUNDING- WERE YOU KNOW THE- MORE- GONNA CONTINUE OUR INVEST. AND THEN I. OF THERE'S A- AND I COME FROM THE GOVERNOR A GOVERNMENT. WILL DEFINITELY LOOK TO APPLY. AND HAVE THAT LIKE THE- BUILT INTO THE- PROVIDE MATCH. I'M SURE MY CALL WILL HAVE SOME ON THAT OR LET'S A LET'S GO TO THE- MISS. TAYLOR OTHER THAN FLAG- BRING THAT WE HAVE. AND THAT AND TROUT AUGMENTATION ON THE DROUGHT PACKAGE IN ADDITION TO LAST YEAR'S MONEY AND THE EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION THAT'S APPROPRIATE- THIS YEAR FROM LAST YEAR'S ACTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RACHEL EHLERS FROM LA- NICE TO SEE YOU ALL- YEAH WE THINK IT IS HELPFUL TO THINK AOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE AND KIND OF TWO. CATEGORIES ONE IS THE IMMEDIATE DROUGHT RESPONSE TO RESPOND TO AN IMMEDIATE PRESSING CONCERNS AND THEN THOSE PROPOSALS THAT ARE MORE FOCUSED ON LONGER TERM KIND OF RESILIENCE FOR FUTURE DROUGHTS SO IN THAT FIRST CATEGORY IT'S REALLY TOO EARLY TO TELL EVEN JUST A MONTH AGO WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS RELEASED. THINGS SEEMED A LOT BETTER THAN THEY SEEM TODAY- SO YOU KNOW WE'LL KNOW MORE ABOUT AS THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN EVERYTHING USUALLY FALLS SO BY THE MAY REVISION I THINK. I WILL HAVE A BETTER PERSPECTIVE ON HOW MUCH OF THAT MEDIA AT WHETHER IT'S THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CONTINGENCY FIND OR THAT KIND OF ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE MILLION THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER MORE IMMEDIATE. DROUGHT RESPONSE ACTIVITIES IN THIS PACKAGE SO- WE RECOMMEND KIND OF WAITING AND SEEING ON ON THAT MANY BUT BEING PREPARED THAT WE MAY NEED TO HAVE. ATTENTION LEE SOME OF THAT MONEY POTENTIALLY MORE THAN THAT MANY- DEPENDING ON HOW THE HYDROLOGY DEVELOPS IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS. IN TERMS OF THE LONGER TERM RESILIENCE THAT IS WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER THE BULK OF THIS PACKAGE TO BE NOT FOCUSED ON IMMEDIATE. RESPONSE BUT REALLY RESILIENCE ON THE LONGER TERM BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S A BAD THING THAT CERTAINLY HAS MERIT AND AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED BY YOUR SPEAKERS ALREADY THE BEST TIME TO PREPARE FOR DROUGHT IS BEFORE THE DAY COMES- BECAUSE IT THAT THIS PROJECTS DO TAKE A LONG TIME TO QUIT. A SIGN AND I. CAN YOU CAN TAKE CAN TAKE MONTHS OR YEARS. SO WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT IS A VALUE FOR THE STATE HOWEVER WHEN YOU DID MAKE VERY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THAT THROUGH THE TWENTY. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR AS WELL AS. THE AS YOU MENTIONED MISTER CHAIR THE EIGHT IN THE MILLION. PRO IN THE BUDGET BEFORE YOU. FOR THE BUDGET YEAR SO NOT. IT EVEN IF DIDN'T AND I ANY OF THE GOVERNOR'S NEW. THE STATE STILL BE ROOM SO. PROGRESS ON THAT GOAL. SO I THINK OUR OUR MAIN MESSAGE HE WAS NOT THAT THIS ISN'T A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE STATE BUT I THINK YOU CAN CONSIDER WHETHER THIS IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR YOUR GENERAL FUND. THIS YEAR. GIVEN THOSE THAT EITHER SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND ALL THE OTHER PRIORITIES YOU HAVE IN THE BUDGET. SO IT IS A HIGH PRIORITY. AND CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR YOU IS NOT THE ONLY APPROACH YOU CAN TAKE- YOU COULD CONSIDER MODIFICATIONS THAT REALLY ADDRESSED WENT. WHAT YOU AS A LEGISLATURE THINK ARE THE HIGHEST STATE PRIORITIES. SO FOR EXAMPLE- YOU COULD CONSIDER IT MORE MANY FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE SINCE THOSE ARE ACTIVITIES THAT REALLY. SHOW A LOT OF PROMISE FOR WATER SUPPLY AS WELL AS OTHER BENEFITS LIKE FLOOD CONTROL SO. IT'S A PRETTY WE WOULD WE WOULD CHARACTERIZE AS A PRETTY MODEST COMPONENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL ONLY THIRTY MILLION SO YOU COULD CONSIDER A GREATER INVESTMENT IN THAT AREA. THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH MONEY IN THAT KIND OF CATEGORY FOR. THE RECENT PACKAGE THAT PASSED. SIMILARLY WE THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER A- PERHAPS A SMALLER INVESTMENT IN WATER CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. JUSTGIVEN THAT IS A RELATIVELY SMALL. SHARE OF WATER USE ACROSS THE STATE BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE STATE HAS PUT A BIG. EMPHASIS IN THAT AREA THROUGH POLICY CHANGES- AND THROUGH ACTIVITIES DURING THE LAST DROUGHT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS IN IN GREATER WATER EFFICIENCIES IN THAT URBAN SETTING. SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THAT IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR YOUR AB INVESTMENTS THIS YEAR SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE THEM. AN AND AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION'S LAND RECORD BESTING PROGRAM WE THINK THAT HAS A LOT OF PROMISE IT REALLY FOCUSES ON SOME REALLY IMPORTANT GOALS AS THE DIRECTOR DISCUSSED. BUT IT IS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OUTCOMES YET. WE DON'T REALLY KNOWHOW THE PROGRAM IS SHAPING UP WITH THE DEMAND WILL BE YOU HAVE AND HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS WHETHER IT NEEDS SOME. KIND OF RESHAPING AS IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED. SO YOU KNOW YOU COULD THINK ABOUT THAT AS A PILOT EFFORT THIS YEAR AND WAIT TO BEFORE MAKING FURTHER INVESTMENTS TO WE GET SOME OUTCOME DATA. SO THOSE ARE JUST. A FEW EXAMPLES OF WAYS THAT YOU COULD TWEAK THIS PACKAGE TO REFLECT PAY OR- AT ANOTHER. WE WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE TO AND- IS. THINKING ABOUT THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT OR THE GANN LIMIT AS YOU HAVE DISCUSSED IN FULL COMMITTEE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- SO AS YOU THINK ABOUT IF YOU WERE GOING TO. CHANGE WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THINKING ABOUT THAT OVERALL CALCULATIONS OF WHICH ACTIVITIES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE LIMIT OR NOT SHE TYPICALLY CAPITAL OUTLAY ACTIVITIES ARE EXCLUDED SO- THAT. THAT MAY BE HELPFUL AT FRAMEWORK AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS PACKAGE. AND THEN THE FINAL POINT I WOULD MAKE IS ONE THAT YOU MISTER CHAIR HAVE ALREADY RAISED AS HAVE SEVERAL THE SPEAKERS WHICH IS GREAT WHICH IS OVERSIGHT. THIS IS A LOT OF MANY AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND STATE INVESTED IN WATER RESILIENCE. AND TYPICALLY THOSE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN THROUGH BONDS. AND TYPICALLY WITH BOND LANGUAGE THERE'S A LOT OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY KIND OF BUILT IN AND REPORTING LANGUAGE AND IN EVEN ON NOT ONLY ON WHAT PROJECTS ARE FUNDED BUT- ALSO ON OUTCOMES HOW DOLLARS ARE FLOWING OUT THE DOOR. THAT ISN'T AUTOMATICALLY BUILT IN WITH THIS PACKAGE THAT YOU ARE APPROVED IN THE IN THE MOST RECENT BUDGET. WHAT'S GREAT IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING THAT ON ALREADY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION- WHERE WE'VE GOT A REALLY GREAT START BUT WE WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE REQUESTING THAT INFORMATION. MONITORING THAT INFORMATION NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S GOOD GOVERNMENT AND OVERSIGHT OVER PUBLIC DOLLARS BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO HELP. GUIDE YOUR FUTURE DECISIONS AND THINKING ABOUT WHICH PROGRAMS ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED WHICH PROGRAMS MIGHT HAVE TROUBLE GETTING MONEY OUT THE DOOR- WHERE THERE MIGHT BE BARRIERS OR OBSTACLES THAT NEED. INTERVENTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE'RE SEEING GREAT SUCCESSES WHERE WE MIGHT NEED TO TWEAK THINGS TO SEE MORE SUCCESS SO REALLY ENCOURAGED THAT CONTINUED OVERSIGHT OVER THESE DOLLARS. I'M NOT ONLY IN THE COMING MONTHS TO INFORM THIS BUDGET BUT IN THE COMING YEARS TO INFORM. YOUR FUTURE INVESTMENTS. AND HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION ENHANCING QUESTIONS. I THINK WE'LL TAKE A- YOUR. PURPOSING GRANT I DO I DID HEAR DIRECTOR SAY THAT THERE. JUST GETTING THE NOTICE OUT TO THE NOW AND THINK THAT THEY'LL THE MILLION THAT WE APPROPRIATE WILL OVER SUPER WHEN LOOK AT THE MAY REVISE WILL HAVE MORE UP TO DATE NUMBERS I ASSUME THAT THAT'S HAPPENING IN EVERY DEPARTMENT AND EVERY AGENCY WHERE THEY'LL THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SAY LOOK THIS THING WAS OVERSUBSCRIBED AND EVEN THE FORTY MILLION WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO WE'LL KEEP THAT ON THE BURNERS AND THE CONSERVE. OKAY SO YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT MAYBE IT'S YEAR YEAR OBSERVATION ARE STAFF REPORT ON PAGE FIFTY EIGHT STARTS DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN AN EIGHT OF TEN TEN YEARS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WE SAW AN ADDITIONAL SAID. AT IT THE WORK IS BEING DONE AND ONLY. 20% OF THE BUDGET ON CONSERVATION IS FOR AGRICULTURE AND WE HEARD SECRETARY ROSS TALK ABOUT. HOW MANY ACRES ARE BEING YOU KNOW. FILE EACH YEAR AND THAT MONEY DO THE- WATER CONSERVE EFFORTS TO INCREASE AND THE CROP. HE ALSO OUT SO MY- IS TO SHOULD WE BE TRANSFERRING OR SHOULD WE CONSIDER. PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THE AGRICULTURE OR SHOULD WE JUST. ARE ON CONSERVATION OR SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT OTHER. OTHER THAN CONSERVATION OTHER RANDOM MORE MONEY AND SIGMAR MORE MONEY AND AT THE A DIFFERENT PROGRAM IS IT IS IT. DISCUSS ADVERSE IS RESIDENTIAL OR THE OR THE BALANCE MAYBE IT SHOULD BE EIGHTY TWENTY THE OTHER WAY I I'M- INTERESTED IN YOUR THOUGHTS. YEAH I THINK I AM WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO VIEW. KIND OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED MILLION ON WATER CONSERVATION AS MEANING THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED MILLION ON WATER CONSERVATION AND DECIDE HOW MUCH IS ACT VERSUS- AND I THINK. YOU YOU HAVE OPTIONS TO DECIDE WHAT ARE YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND SOME OF THOSE MIGHT BE ON DEMAND MANAGEMENT WHICH IS- WHAT KIND OF WATER CONSERVATION IS LOWERING DEMAND- AS SECRETARY ROSS MENTIONED THERE IS ALSO ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET THAT WAS PART OF THAT EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION FOR THE AG SWEEP PROGRAM SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT THIS IS THE ONLY FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THAT- BUT BUT YOU COULD ALSO THINK ABOUT WATER SUPPLY. WHICH AGAIN RIGHT AROUND WATER RECHARGE IS ONE OF THE ACTIVITIES- AS WELL AS AS OTHER WATER SUPPLY ACTIVITIES- LIKE LIKE WATER RECYCLING FOR EXAMPLE- SO REALLY IN GETTING TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE WATER. APPROACH STATEWIDE THEIR WATER DEMAND MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION IS ONE CATEGORY BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER ACTIVITIES SO I THINK WE WOULD CONSIDER UNITS AT BREAK A MANDATE YOU DON'T CONSIDER WATER CONSERVATION KIND OF IN A VACUUM BUT BUT THINK ABOUT YOUR LARGER SUITE OF OPTIONS. OKAY OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ADDITIONALITY THAT WE HAVE WE THERE'S A CHUNK OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THAT WERE CUT IT SEE WHAT HAPPENS THIS SPRING HOW MUCH RAIN WE HAVE. AND HOLD THE FACT- I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO COME. ON THE TIDAL WAVE OF FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S COMING WE KNOW THAT THERE'S THREE POINT EIGHT THAT'S GUARANTEED THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET. AND HOW WE COULD. USE THE CURRENT BUDGET REQUESTS. WITH THE ANTICIPATION OF WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING TO GO. BUT AS OUR ALLUDED TO. SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION OUT OF EPA FIVE POINT FIVE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FEMALE THREE POINT FIVE THAT IS FLOOD COULD. FLOOD ASSISTANCE AND IN THE APARTMENT INTERIOR WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH THEIR SEVENTEEN BILLION SO. IS IT. ONE DOES THAT THE PACKAGE ROOM AND GET WE WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE AYE AYE J. A. BUT SHOULD WE BE THINKING OF READ RATHER THAN HOLDING BACK MONEY- ADJUSTING THE APPROPRIATIONS WITH SOME OF THE MONEY IS LIKE A BLOCK GRANT SO THAT THE AGENCIES OR THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE THE MONEY TO GO SEEK SOME MORE FEDERAL MONEY VERSUS SPEND THAT ON THE PURPOSES THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN THE AGREEMENT LAST YEAR IS IT IS IT WAS A LOT OF THIS IS GOING QUICK AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SPECIAL. SESSION OR SPECIAL HEARING AND IN JULY SO I CAN THE SECOND CHANGE APPROPRIATIONS SO THEY CAN DO THIS INSTEAD OF THAT BUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHERE I'M GOING% WITH THIS IS THAT IS THAT THERE'S SO MUCH THAT'S ON THE TABLE THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU KNOW BUILDING RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE THE BRICK PROGRAM WITH THAT ALL MY SECURITY TO BILLION DOLLARS AND AN OFFICIAL WILDLIFE HE WE GOT THIS THING ABOUT BUILDING RESILIENCY WE THINK WE HAVE WE MEET HERE WE CAN APPLY FOR THIS BUT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY BY THE LEGISLATURE COULD YOU COMMENT ON. THAT YEAH I THINK IT'S A FAIR. POINT THE TIMING IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH YET ABOUT THE SPECIFICS ON THE FEDERAL- PACKAGES IN ALLOCATIONS. NOR HOW MUCH WILL FLOW THROUGH KIND OF OUR STATE AGENCIES VERSUS LOCAL AGENCIES JUST APPLYING DIRECTLY SOME OF THOSE- GRANTS ARE ARE STRUCTURED THAT WAY. SO I THINK AT SOME OF THE- CONSIDERATIONS TO THINK ABOUT ARE WHAT WILL THE STATE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS SPEED. EVEN ON THAT THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION THAT WE KNOW THE WATER BOARD WILL GET FOR CLEAN DRINKING WATER. AND WASTEWATER THERE WILL BE STATE SOME STATE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS THERE SO THINKING ABOUT- AS YOU MENTIONED MISTER CHAIR WHAT FUNDING DO WE NEED TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THAT FEDERAL MONEY- AND ALSO AVOIDING DUPLICATION AND THINKING ABOUT IT WAREFARE FORGETTING FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SOME PURPOSES MAYBE THAT MEANS THAT WE CAN REPURPOSE OUR STATE DOLLARS FOR OTHER PRIORITIES THAT DON'T HAVE IT- I DO THINK IT'S A LITTLE IT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE BUT WE- AS YOU SAID DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK IN SEPTEMBER OCTOBER WHERE. THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT IN SESSION WE'RE GETTING FUNDING WE'RE GETTING SECTION LETTERS THROUGH THE JAIL B. C. AND WE'RE NOT PREPARED SO. I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT THAT SEEKING AN UPDATE IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS PERHAPS WHEN WE'RE STILL IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND IT'S NOT TOO LATE- BUT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION THAN WE DO RIGHT NOW. SOME REALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION OF. WHICH MEANS IT'S A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD WERE. FOR DOING WHAT. PLAN THE ACCOUNTABILITY DANCE SOMEWHERE SENATE SHOW ME THIS WORDS MONEY THAT WE GIVE YOU THIS MONEY DID YOU SPEND A DID YOU DO IT YOU DO IT AND THEN REALIZED. THAT PERHAPS WHO WOULD KNOW THAT IF THE MONEY DIDN'T GO OUT THE DOOR. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE SEE THAT WE'VE GOT GUIDELINES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR AND IF WE REPURPOSE. THAT WILL. INCREASE THE FUNDING IN THE AND THE AREA MY COLLEAGUES MAY HAVE A- OF- SO LET'S GO TO. VICE CHAIR DOLLY OF I WANT TO JUST GO WITH THE OF WATER OF. SO ON A COUPLE OF NUMBER ONE ITEM IS- ILLEGAL GROWS ELITE WE HAVE EIGHT ABOUT PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA'S ON ILLEGAL GROWS AND I WAS WONDERING- WHAT WHAT THE PROCESS IS FOR GETTING WORKING TO GET TO. RESOURCES OUT ON THE GROUND ACTUALLY TO CLEAN UP THE SITES AND TO HELP- THAT ARE CONTAMINATING OUR FOR OUR SERVICE WATER IN OUR GROUNDWATER R. OKAY THANK YOU- THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY FOR THE- FOR THE QUESTION- THAT IS I THINK MORE APPROPRIATELY DIRECTED AT MY COLLEAGUES AT THE WATER BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE YOU ARE ENGAGED IN- YOU KNOW CANNABIS CULTIVATION. ILLEGAL CONCERT CULTIVATION AND IN SOME PLACES AND HOW THEY- MONITOR WATER USE SO RESPECTFULLY I WILL- TURN IT OVER TO CHAIR ASK ABOUT- AND- DIRECTOR CHUCK BONHAM. JOHN AT THANK YOU OF I THANK YOU THAT DIRECTOR NAME. I WE WORK HAND IN HAND WITH THE LOCALS WHEN IT COMES TO ENFORCEMENT AROUND THE SITES- WHAT WE HAVE AT THE WATER BOARDS ARE A WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND I'M FORSMAN ABILITY THERE UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT THAT. REALLY HELPS WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROSECUTION OF THE SITES- INSOFAR AS IT REALLY BLESSING IT UP TO A FELONY AND I WORK IN TIGHT COORDINATION THE CFW AS WELL AND NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS TIED TO REALLY CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND. THE CHALLENGE OF ILLEGAL GROWS BY ALSO FOCUSING I KNOW HERE ON ENSURING WE HAVE A LEGAL MARKET- TO INSTRUCT TO WHERE- THE INDUSTRY CAN GO WHILE TIGHTENING DOWN ON WHAT ARE THESE ILLEGAL GROWS THAT YOUR POINT TO HAVE WATER QUALITY IMPACTS AND SO. WE THROUGH OUR REGIONAL BOARDS HAVE A PROGRAM THERE AGAIN ND IT'S BEEN VERY TIGHTLY COORDINATED WITH AND TAKES THE LEAD FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- ON ON A NUMBER OF- THE RATES AND BUST AND THEN ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO. CLEAN UP THERE AFTER THE SITES- DIRECTOR BOTTOM IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO ADD. ONE THING AND SYNERGY DOLLY I'D BE GLAD TO. FIND TIME OFFLINE IF YOUR OFFICE HAS FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AT OUR DEPARTMENT PROVIDE THE MAIN. KIND OF FIELD SUPPORT FOR INVESTIGATIONS AND EVENTUALLY PROSECUTIONS. AND WE DO THAT WORK AT A COUNTY LEVEL WE'RE CONSTANTLY IN DISCUSSIONS WITH EACH OF THE COUNTIES SHERIFF'S. AND WE'RE IN A PLANNING CYCLE NOW FOR WHAT. COULD BE THE UP COMING FIELD SEASON. NOW EACH COUNTY ALL THE OF COURSE. DOES HANDLE LIKE NOR DOES. WHICH DOES HANDLE IT LIKE DR. BUT NONETHELESS US- OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE REALLY DOES RUN THROUGH OUR COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH COUNTIES AT THE SHERIFF'S AND SUPERVISE OR LEVEL. SO IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UPS WOULD BE GLAD TO SCHEDULE IT I'M IN THE OFFICE WELL I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CONTROL AND- IT NEEDS TO BE A COORDINATED- UNFORTUNATELY COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO. GO OUT AND DO ENFORCEMENT I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE DEALING WITH SMASH AND GRAB CRIME THEY'RE DEALT WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN TOWN AND THERE'S REALLY NO COORDINATED EFFORT I MEAN WE'VE TOURED. ED MAINLY IN SISKIYOU- AND WE WILL HAVE I HAVE FARMERS ARE GETTING HAMMERED FOR WATER QUALITY ISSUES AS I GOT ILLEGAL GROWS UPSTREAM THAT AND NOBODY'S DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR DUMPING. HUMAN WASTE ON THE GROUND. AND IN CHEMICALS AND YOU NAME IT I MEAN YOU CAN GOOGLE EARTH SISKIYOU COUNTY AND YOU CAN SEE THE DEVASTATION THAT'S HAPPENING SO THERE NEED TO BE. SOMEWHERE IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS AND READY TO BE FOR ME IT'S MORE ABOUT. LIKE THERE HAS TO BE A PLAN WITH THE AG'S OFFICE HAS TO BE A PLAN WITH. WITH THE BE A FISHING GAME. AND THAT'S THE PLAN OF THE WATER BOARD THERE'S TODAY IT IS HARD TO BEAT. ALL PEOPLE TOGETHER ALL. ON BOARD BECAUSE- IF YOU THREE IF YOU TURN ON THE LOCAL COUNTY THERE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GET IT DONE. AND SENATOR LET ME CORRECT THE MISSTATEMENT PERHAPS I DON'T ARGUE OR BELIEVE WE THROW IT ON TO THE LOCAL COUNTIES WE'RE DELIVERING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STATE. INVESTMENT IN THE SPACE OF A PARTNERSHIP LEVEL WHAT I MEANT TO SAY IS. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHERE TO PURSUE THESE ACTIONS IN A COUNTY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ENGAGING THE COUNTY SO THEY CAN ADVISE AS WELL. I THINK IF YOU'RE WILLING IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR THOSE OF US IN THIS SPACE TO COME AND GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN A CONCERTED COMPREHENSIVE WAY ACROSS ALL STATE GOVERNMENT. SHOULD WELL I WOULD I WOULD WELCOME THAT I'VE BEEN OUT ON THE GROUND WE'VE ASKED. THEM YOUR OFFICE TO COME WITH US AND- WE HAVEN'T GOT PEOPLE OUT THERE WE GOT HELICOPTERS FROM THE NATIONAL GUARD AND WE FLEW UP THERE AND- WE LOOKED AT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND- I MEAN IF THE PUBLIC REALLY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THEM BUT FOR ME IT'S JUST. IT'S JUST. IS NOT RIGHT THAT WE HAMMER THE GUY THAT'S TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING ON THE- GROUND. THE FARMER GETS PENALIZED FOR EVERYTHING IF HE- IF HE- ÁP DOES IT TAKE FOR A COHO FRY. HE'S HE'S GONNA PAY OR HE'S GONNA GET REGULATED BUT RIGHT UPSTREAM. WE HAVE JUST ILLEGAL GROWS AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF DUMPING AND WE DON'T IT'S THIS. IS ALL RIGHT. AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND I'LL- I WANT TO BE THE TABLE I'M ALWAYS AT THE TABLE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAN LESS WE HAVE A COORDINATED. EFFORT THAT DOES NOT RELY ON THE COUNTY ALONE. WE NEED WE NEED HELP FROM THE AG'S OFFICE WE NEED HELP WE NEED THE RESOURCES TO GO IN AND CLEAN THESE UP AND THEN WE NEED. IT OR WHATEVER GET YOU WORK ON THE LEGAL SIDE OF MARIJUANA ALL DAY. BUT IF 80% OF THE ILLEGAL GROWS THEY'RE NOT DOING IT AND IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT SO I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD. THAT ONCE AGAIN. IT'S ANOTHER YEAR INTO THE PROCESS. AND WE NEED TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM IS IT'S- THROUGHOUT THE WATERSHEDS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE'S FEDERAL LAND. AND THERE'S- AND THERE'S PRIVATE LANDS AS WELL BUT IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO I JUST WANNA GO ON RECORD. AND I'M AVAILABLE TO GO LOOK AT IT AND- AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN GET THE AG'S OFFICE AND SOME. SOME TEETH IN OUR LAWS. TO STOP THIS. THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT SECOND QUESTION I HAD WAS ON WATER AGAIN. WE L. LAST YEAR. WE SO THE KALENJIN PROGRAM IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SHUT DOWN THESE WELLS. LAST YEAR I ASKED ABOUT BECAUSE WE'RE ONE WHICH WE DON'T HAVE CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER. SO WHO WOULD THERE'S FIFTY POSITIONS. ALLOCATED IN THAT CAL JIM PROGRAM AND LET AND OTHERS FIFTY VACANCIES AND THERE'S A THEY'RE ASKING FOR TEN MORE. POSITIONS AND SO. LAST YEAR I ASKED BROUGHT UP THE SAME ISSUE WHY DIVERSE TO ONLY TWO HIRES THE YEAR BEFORE. SO WE HAVE FIFTY VACANCIES AND REST FOR TEN MORE POSITIONS WHAT IS THE PROBLEM IN GETTING. THE ABILITY FOR SOMEBODY TO GET HIRED NOW THIS IS ON THE SECOND THIS IS A SECOND YEAR I'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION. AND WE'RE ADDING MORE POSITIONS BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING PEOPLE. TO THE JOBS NOT GETTING DONE VICTOR CROWFOOT. THANKS SO MUCH SENATOR I'M I'M MAY OUT. OUT WITH THE VEHICLE ON JUNE MY COLLEAGUE DAVID SHE MADE IN A DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION METHODS ESPECIALLY THE MOTHER DEPARTMENT OVER CAL JOHN. BERNARD ALI I NEEDED BUT I NEED YOU. AND THE ACTUAL CURRENT THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER MOST ACCURATELY I BELIEVE WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS. IN REDUCING THE BACON. I LEVEL CAL. WE HEARD YOUR FEEDBACK AND THE FEEDBACK OF OTHERS LAST YEAR AROUND. WORKING TO REDUCE THOSE DAY CARE PROJECTOR. FOR OUR OR JUST OF. TO OPT. DIRECT SHE MADE HIM I ALSO YOU- TO YOU AN ANSWER OFFLINE- BASED ON THE MOST RECENT DAY THAT I CAN- I CAN ACT UP. THE PUSH IT OUT OF SIGHT- SO OUR VACANCY RATE IN CAL J. HAS THAT DECLINED WERE OUT OF 8% THIS POINT IN TIME LAST YEAR AND WE'RE DOWN TO ABOUT THIRTEEN PERCENT- YOU KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE FACING IS- WE HAVE A LOT OF POSITIONS TO FILL WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BUT WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ALSO. IS MOVING PEOPLE UP WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF TO FILL OPEN POSITIONS AND THEN ALSO AT THE SAME TIME WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE SEEN WHICH I THINK IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE AS- A LOT OF RETIREMENTS AND SO WE ARE WE'RE HIRING SEVENTY EIGHT PEOPLE A MONTH TO FILL POSITIONS- BUT WE'RE HAVING THAT SAMENUMBER IF NOT MORE. RETIRE OUT OF UPSTATE SERVICE ND SO- I YOU KNOW SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT WE ARE WE ARE ACTUALLY SEEING A DECLINE IN OUR VACANCY RATE- BUT YOU KNOW WILL ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THERE STILL WORK TO DO TO FILL POSITIONS. RECALLING THANK YOU FOR THAT I JUST WANT NOW HAVE A- ALMOST ALL ALL THE SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT. IN WHERE WE ARE CLIMATE. AND SO. I DON'T THIS IS A GENERAL. QUESTION SO WE HAVE WE'VE HAD IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND THE START OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WAS THE WETTEST YEAR ON RECORD IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE CAME OUT OF A DROUGHT IN TWO THOUSAND FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE PASSED PROP ONE. IN THAT TIME SO WE COULD DO. THAT WATER CAR OUR WATER STORAGE AND SOME WATER CONSERVATION. TO THE VOTERS HAVE BEEN ON BOARD FOR YEARS SINCE I THINK SINCE LIKE NINETEEN NINETY SIX WE'VE PASSED LIKE TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS TO DO WATER CONSERVATION AND WATER. MANAGEMENT BUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE BOOM AND BUST OF THE CLIMATE. AND WE'RE SEEING THIS YEAR WE HAD WILL WHAT. FALL DENSE DRY RIGHT NOW SO WHAT IS THE LONG TERM PLAN IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BOOM AND BUST WE'RE GONNA FOR THE WETTEST YEAR ON RECORD IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILL DROP BEFORE THAT WERE IN DROUGHT NOW. WHAT IS IT WHAT IS THE PUBLIC. WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO WE EXPECT FOR THE PUBLIC WE NEED TO HAVE WATER RELIABILITY I HEARD THAT LIKE IT'S THROUGH THE THEME OF THIS BUT HAVE WATER RELIABILITY TO BE ABLE TO RECHARGE GROUNDWATER. YOU HAVE TO HAVE WATER. SO WHY DON'T WE TAKE SOME OF THIS MONEY IN THIS BUDGET AND BUILD. BIKE SITES RESERVOIR. T. ROWE THE GENERAL FUND. BUT A COUPLE BILLION DOLLARS A BILL SUCH AS MORE WHICH IS OFF. STREAM STORAGE PROJECT WHICH HELPS THE DELTA WHICH HELPS. IT INCREASES WATER. AND WE HAVE NOT BUILT ANY WATER STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA SINCE PAT BROWN WAS. OUR GOVERNOR. AND WE'VE ADDED TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE WE CANNOT JUST CONTINUE TO CONSERVE OUR PAY COMMUNITIES TO OUR PAY FARMERS TO LEAVE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE BEST WITH FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS RE PURPOSING LAND IT'S BASICALLY. GIVEN THAT MONEY SO THEY CAN GO TO SOME OTHER STATE WINNERS WATER SOME OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT LAND ON THE ISLAND WE WILL PUMP WATER ON. SO WHAT IS THE OVERALL PLAN IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE BOOM AND BUST HOW DO WE SUSTAIN OVER THE BOOM AND BUST. THROUGH CLIMATE CHANGE AND ACTUALLY PROVIDE A WATER THAT IS RELIABLE AND GOOD FOR THE FISH FOR THE PEOPLE FOR AGRICULTURE FOR ALL THOSE THINGS WHAT IS THE LONG TERM PLAN INSTEAD OF JUST THROWING MONEY AT IT AND NOT ACTUALLY INCREASING THE WATER YOU'LL- ANYBODY WANNA JUMP IN. YEAH SURE IN ORDER. OBVIOUS ARE A BIG. BUT I'LL I'LL TAKE A CRACK AT LEAST THIRTY EXPLAIN. YOU KNOW FIVE WHICH I BELIEVE IS OUR VIEW. BRING IT OUT. THERE IS CLEAR. A NUMBER. OF ACTUALLY WE NEED TO TAKE YOUR- RECHARGE BAKUL- IN THESE WAY YEAR. WE KNOW WE- AMPLE. STORAGE UNDER. IT NEEDS MORE. AND WE NEED DO A BETTER JOB. CAPTURING THE RAIN DOES. IN THOSE YEARS THANK ATWATER UNDER. I THINK THERE PROGRESS BEING MADE. BUT STREAMLINE THE AVAIL TO DO THAT IN TWO THROUGH. THE PROCESS SO THAT IT AND OR OTHER FOLKS WATER RIGHT BUT SOMEBODY WANTS TO DO THAT THAT'S WHY IMPORTANCE FORWARD SHE- AFTER THOSE WHAT THE EXAM WHEN WATER UNDERGROUND. NUMBER TWO AND WE NEED TO FILL UP LIKE TO OF JUST AND A GOOD. IS TO CREATE MORE FOR. IN A ROW. REPORTER FOR RATHER MORE. ARE UPDATING THE ARMY CORPS WHAT HERTZBERG IN MANY CASES ARE- OVER FIFTY OLD. HELLO FOR MORE BLACK USED TO BE IN. THAT WE ARE BILL. I IN WAY THAT BOTH PROTECT OUR THE PUBLIC FROM BLOOD BUT- PROVIDE. OUR WATER SO. WE'VE SEEN THAT- MORE I YOU KNOW WE WAY AND WILL DO FIX THAT PAPER LIKE FOR A BILL AND- YOU COLOR ARE. YOU A CURRENT AREA IS THIS QUESTION OF A GROUND STORAGE AFTER RIGHT PROP WINDING COULD OVER TWO BILLION TO. OR UNDER AND SURFACE ULTIMATELY PER A LET HAD. QUITE A LOT OF REQUIRE FOR THE PROJECT IS SPOKE ON OUR BUT GOING THOUGH REQUIRE. TO ENABLE THAT STATE INVESTMENT IN THOSE. WHICH ALSO PUT YOUR COURSE YOU TYPE RATHER MORE. THAT WE RACKED THE BAN ALONG TIME IN COMING IN TERMS GETTING A PROP ONE DOLLARS- YOU KNOW TO WITH ALL THIS. OF THE PROPER BOND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. BUT MORE FOCUSED ON AND WE CAN TO MAKE. ON THAT I'LL BE THAT YEAH BANTERED OUT OF. YOU KNOW ALL YOUR QUESTION BUT I WOULD WANTED TO GET YOU A BUNCH INTO SOME OF OUR. BUT I PERSONALLY THAT AND I. THE YOU KNOW HERE TEN YEARS TO DOING. BEEN WELL I WAS TALK ABOUT FIVE THE YOU KNOW THE BIG WITH THE BIG RESERVOIR WE HAVE ACTUALLY BY THIS WE IS THAT WHICH IS THE ONE THE WE BURN ALMOST A MILLION A AND ONE FOR. IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS THE WATERSHED OF FEATHER RIVER WHAT IS GONNA TAKE SIXTY YEARS TO RECOUP AND WE AND WE- SAW WHAT THE I'M A CO WITH THIS. I KNOW IS AN EASY. WE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN FACED WITH SOME REALLY CRAZY THINGS BUT ACCOUNTABILITY IS WHAT I HEARD FROM ONE OF THE SPEAKERS. WE HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY DELIVER SOMETHING. FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN DUMPED IN THE CALIFORNIA SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE THERE'S BEEN NO SHORTAGE OF MONEY. THERE'S MORE MONEY IN THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAN THERE'S EVER BEEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE. WE GOT MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE TACK OVER TAXING PEOPLE MORE MONEY HERE THAN THERE'S EVER BEEN. BUT WHAT ARE WE GETTING FOR I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE PUBLIC IS ASKING WE IF. IF WE DON'T DO A BETTER JOB OF LIKE MANAGING GETTING THE MONEY TO THE GROUND. I MEAN. MY WHOLE CAREER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF BEING ELECTED I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR MONEY TO FIX A PROBLEM AND WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF MONEY. AND WE CAN'T SEEM TO GET THE MONEY TO THE GROUND AND ACTUALLY ACCOUNTABLE AND HAVE IT AND HAVE IT. PROCESSED IN A WAY WHERE WE ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING DONE AND SO I JUST WANT TO THAT'S MY FRUSTRATION WITH. MARIJUANA IT'S LIKE WE GOT ALL KINDS OF MONEY. WE GOT TO THE FARMER BUT WE CAN'T SEEM TO GET UPSTREAM TO GET WHERE THERE'S A I BELIEVE A BIGGER PROBLEM SO I. I'M AT THE TABLE I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU- I'M SHARE I'M LIVING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT I'M LIVING IN MY DISTRICT IT'S 60% OF THE WATERSHED FOR CALIFORNIA I REPRESENT. AND IT GRIEVES ME DEEPLY TO WATCH IT BE DESTROYED. AND I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER I WANT TO BE I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO GET IT DONE WE HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE- THERE'S NO LACK OF MONEY. IS IT IT'S LACK OF GETTING STUFF DONE SO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME HERE TODAY OKAY BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT SENATORS WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO I'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH IT OFFICIALLY. MISS ROY COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT TASKING. HERE ALLEY. REQUIRE STERN- FORMS A STAB WISH SENATE MCGUIRE GO HEAD. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR- IN APPRECIATE THAT EVERY. AT FROM- EACH OF THE REPRESENTED OF THE AGING TODAY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH FOR I'D EXCUSE THREE AT ITEM FOR ITEM FIFTY SEVEN AS WELL AS ITEM SIXTY. THIRTY IN ITEM FOR- IN REASON YOU NAY GREATLY. CHAIRMAN SKIS- BELIEVED TO BE REMOVED ITEM FOR ACTION. LOOK IN IN I ALSO WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO. DR BONHAM THIS IS RELATING TO- ITEM FOR IN THE DUNGEONS FISHERY. I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT. HOW SERGEANTS CRAP FLEET HAS BEEN STRUCK TO SAY THE LEAST- ENTIRE SEASONS OF THE DUNGEONS CRAB FISHERY BEEN CLOSED OR SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAILED SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. IN THE HARD WORKING WOMEN AND MEN OF CALIFORNIA'S CRAB FLEET ARE IN DIRE STRAITS. YET EVERY YEAR FOR DECADES THE STATE HAS EXPECTED THAT THE FLEET GO OUT COLLECTED THE SUPPLIES OF FRESH CRAB THAT MUST BE TESTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR DEMO GAS IT IN OTHER HEALTH RELATED TESTS AS WELL. THE END. I'M GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO MEET WITH THE FLEET EVERY QUARTER AS CHAIR AT FISHERIES AQUACULTURE COMMITTEE I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTICIPATION OF TERROR BONHAM IN THOSE COMMITTEES IS WITH FLEET THE FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE PROCESSORS AND ONE OF THE ITEMS AND IT'S THE TOP ITEM IN FACT THAT THE FLEET HAS CONTINUED TO BRING UP. NUMBER ONE. IS THIS REALLY IS STRUGGLING THE CRAB FISHERY IS WHAT HELPS KEEP RURAL COASTAL COMMUNITY ALIVE AND THEY'RE EXPECTED ON THEIR OWN DIME TO GO COLLECT THE CRAB TO BE ABLE TO GET TESTED THAT'S A MANDATE BY THE STATE. IN FOR LESS THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS WE COULD COMPENSATE THEM ONE TIME AS THE FLEET GOES OUT TO BE ABLE TO GO COLLECTED MANDATED TESTS IT'S AN UNFUNDED MANDATE SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATION ON AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO CHAIRED BY CASKEY- DEPORT TABLING THAT ITEM FOR TODAY KNOW THAT WE'LL HAVE THAT COME BACK. AND I CAN NOW MOVE TO ITEM FIFTY SEVEN. HI IN ITEM FIFTY SEVEN SPEED. I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HATCHERIES- THE CALIFORNIA BERMAN FISH WILDLIFE IS MADE PROGRESS OVER THE LAST YEAR I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR FIFTY MILLION- WAS AGREED UPON LAST YEAR BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR IN COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS FISH WILDLIFE AND ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK YOU TO- SECTOR CROWFOOT FOR HIS FOCUS ON THIS AS WELL AND THE FIFTY MILLION PART OF IT WAS TO BE INVESTED IN OUR STATE TEXTURES TO BECOME- AN INCREASE CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND CANDIDLY SAVING. A SPECIES THAT IS ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION ESPECIALLY IN THE SACRAMENTO AND THAT'S CALIFORNIA'S SALMON. TO HISTORIC- IT'S A TO HISTORICALLY LIKE EVERYTHING IN LIFE RIGHT NOW IN THIS TRANSITION PERIOD AS WE TRANSITION TO A HOTTER DRIER WORLD. WE MUST MOVE FASTER AND WE HAVE TO MOVE WITH SPEED TO ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF CALIFORNIA'S ICONIC SALMON SPECIES. AND AGAIN IT IS ESPECIALLY ON THE SACRAMENTO WE ARE ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION. I'D LIKE TO GO TO DIRECTOR BONHAM ON HATCHERY- FROM THE HATCHERY PROGRAM. BY BELIEF MISTER DIRECTOR IS THAT WE NEED TO UPGRADE ALL OF OUR SALMON HATCHERIES. AND YES YOU HAVE MADE PROGRESS AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I DR BONHAM WAS LITERALLY ON THE GROUND IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED. TAKING SALMON FROM A HATCHERY IN CINEMA COUNTY BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE A CHILLER. AND WE'RE GONNA LOSE IN ANY HEAT WAVE. IN BOTTOM TO A HIGH SCHOOL. WHERE THE HIGH SCHOOL CASA GRANDE WAS ABLE TO KEEP THEM BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A CHILLER NOW THAT'S A GREAT STORY BUT IT'S ALSO AN EMBARRASSMENT. THAT A FRIGGIN WHO ARE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IS DEPENDING ON CASAGRANDE SOPHOMORES TO SAVE. THESE ICONIC SPECIES IN IDEAS USE THAT IS AGAIN THIS IS NOT OF A POCK ON THE DIRECTOR BECAUSE HE MOVED IT NEEDED WHATEVER THE HELL WE NEED TO DO TO BE TO GET IT DONE. AND WE CAN'T RELY ON HIGH SCORES UP AND DOWN THE STATE TO BE TO SAVE THIS SPECIES. SO LOOK MISTER DIRECTOR. WE NEED TO TAKE A HOLISTIC VIEW. OF THE HATCHERY SYSTEM WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AS WELL SO. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO INVEST MORE WELL WE'VE MADE. PROGRESS UNTIL CREATION AND CHILLING SYSTEMS WE NEED TO DO MORE I WANT TO GET YOUR COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK WE'RE DOING ENOUGH IN I DON'T SEE THAT INVESTMENT IN- IDENTITY SEVEN. SOON AND CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE- QUESTION AND ALSO THE EMPHASIS ON OUR HATCHERIES. I AGREE WITH YOU. THEY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE FOR RECREATIONAL. AND COMMERCIAL FISHING MEN AND WOMEN BUT ALSO FOR SPECIES CONSERVATION IN THAT ROLE HAS REALLY DRAMATICALLY CHANGED AND EXPONENTIALLY KIND OF INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON OUR HATCHERIES. BECAUSE OF THIS CLIMATE WISHED LASH AND THE EFFECTS ON OUR FISH. SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF BASIC FACTS I JUST WANT TO ESTABLISH WE OWN OR MANAGE TWENTY ONE TOTAL HATCHERIES IN THE STATE. AND THERE'S KIND OF TWO TYPES WONDER FOR TRIAL INLAND. THE OTHER IS FOR OUR ANADROMOUS SALMON STILL HAD. AND I THINK YOUR QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT THE ANADROMOUS ASPECT AND THERE'S TEN OF THOSE HATCHERIES IN THE STATE. IN REALITY WE ONLY OWN ONE OF THEM HATCHERY SO WE'VE GOT THIS DYNAMIC WHERE ALL THE OTHERS ARE OWNED BY THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION THE ARMY CORPS WHICH IS THE RUSSIAN RIVER RESERVOIR YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES EAST BAY MUD. SO THINKING ABOUT REAL UPGRADE ISN'T ALWAYS JUST CONTROLLED BY US BUT I CONFESS WE LEARNED. LESSONS LAST YEAR WHICH WERE DISTURBING AND WE'RE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS UPON THAT. SO WE'RE CURRENTLY AND THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING WITHIN THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S LOOKING ACROSS EVERYONE OF OUR ANADROMOUS HATCHERIES. DEVELOPING FOR THOSE HATCHERIES ALL OF OUR CONTINGENCY PLANNING AN EXAMPLE. WE KNOW THESE RESERVOIRS MAY NOT HAVE COLD WATER IN THE FUTURE TO SUPPLIER HATCHERIES WHICH ARE BELOW THE DANCE SO IT'S A GREAT STORY AS YOU MENTIONED WE COULD EVACUATE WARM SPRINGS HATCHERY TO THE HIGH SCHOOL. BUT WE ALSO TO HATCHERY IN SANTA CRUZ THAT WAS IMPACTED BY THE LAST ROUND OF FIRES CALL KING FISHER. WE'RE TRYING TO GET IT BACK UP ONLINE AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE ALL THE CONTRACTING AND FINANCING. THE SUPPORT THE HIGH SCHOOL IF WE NEED IT FOR A SECOND YEAR. WE'RE WORKING THROUGH ALL KINDS OF CONTINGENCIES FOR EACH MATCH. AND THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF THIS QUESTION A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT US TO DO. DIFFERENT TYPE OF TAGGING THE FISH. THAT USES DNA. AND I THINK THAT'S THE FUTURE IT'S CALLED PRINTED STACKING. IT REALLY ALLOWS US TO OUR VERY. FINALLY DETERMINED THE PARENTS OF A FISH. RELATIVE TO HATCHERY OR WILD. BUT IT'S NOT AN OVERNIGHT TRANSITION ALL OF THE WEST COAST ALASKA AND CANADA USING EXISTING TECHNOLOGY ALL CROWDED WATER TAX. SO THAT'S PROBABLY OUR FUTURE. BUT THERE MAY BE A WAY WE USE THIS DNA PARENTAGE TACKING TO DO FINER SCALE WORK THAT SUPPLEMENTS AND COMPLIMENTS. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS I THINK THAT ARE IN OUR FUTURE. I APPRECIATE YOU RAISING THE QUESTION I'M I'M COGNIZANT TODAY'S ITEMS HOLD OPEN GET. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR NOW I APPRECIATE IT BUT THE GUY I THINK THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS MONEY IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO USHER IN THE UPGRADE CENTERS ARE NEEDED AND THAT'S- THERE'S JUST NO WAY. AND WHILE I APPRECIATE IT MAY COMPLETE AN ASSESSMENT IT'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PUT IN THE FILTRATION SYSTEMS THE CHILLERS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED. AND LOOK AS MUCH AS WE MAY NOT OWN THE FACILITIES WE DEPEND ON THE FACILITIES. FOR THE STOCK SO IN WE ALSO DEPEND ON THE FACILITIES FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES AND I THINK IT'S ALSO. IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FEDERAL SIDE THE COLEMAN HATCHERY IS ALREADY ADVANCED THIS PARENTAGE- TAGGING AND IT WERE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT OREGON AND WASHINGTON YOU TAKEA LOOK AT ALASKA. THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. MOVE INTO THAT SO I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON THIS AND WE'RE GONNA NEED ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IN WE HAVE TO MOVE WITH SPEED. ON THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION MY LAST ITEM. IF IT WORKS MISTER CHAIR IS IDEN ON ITEM SIXTY IN THIS IS DIRECTED TO CHAIR ASK ABOUT. IN FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT. WE WILL GET A SIXTY WHAT ARE. AGAIN JUST WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH- MISTER MISTER CHAIR FOR THAT AND LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATION ON THE ISSUE HATCHERIES IN THE FUTURE. WE'LL GET TO THAT AND SECOND CENTER STERN. I RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND TAKE YOU TO THE MINISTRATION FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN YOUR LEADERSHIP- WE ALL KNOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO DROUGHT IN THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY IN GENERAL IT'S VERY EASY TO HIT AND ASSUME THAT JUST BECAUSE IT RAINED AGAIN- WE'RE OUT OF THE WOODS AND IT'S ALL OVER- I DO APPRECIATE THE AYE ON. THE SORT OF LONG TERM. RESILIENCE AND KNOWING THAT THERE'S NOT A SORT OF YEAR TO YEAR DROUGHT CYCLE ANYMORE BUT RATHER A GREAT DRYING WE'RE IN AN ERA OF A REDUPLICATION FOR THE ENTIRE WEST. AND THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF THING THAT. WILL GET LUCKY ON SAY IN ONE BUDGET CYCLE AND- PERHAPS NOT HAVE TO SPEND ON THIS I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANY CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT WERE UNDER INVESTING HERE IN GENERAL. I APPRECIATE THE CONTINGENCY FUNDS ON THE TWO AND A FIFTY MILLION- AND IF THERE IS FEDERAL FUNDING POTENTIALLY COMING IN AS WELL. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCALE OF. OF WHAT THE DROUGHT. THAT IS GOING TO CONSUME THE ENTIRE WEST FOR. THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE- ENTAILS EVEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION LIKE MINE- THE SCALE OF INVESTMENT IS MASSIVE I WANTED TO I KNOW SECRETARY BLUMENFELD SPOKE- LAST MONTH ABOUT. THE SCALE OF NEEDED IN ONE OF THESE CATEGORIES AND WATER RECYCLING IN PARTICULAR- WHERE I THINK THERE'S A BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO ALL WESTERN STATES IT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR- BUT THAT. THE SECRETARY POINTED OUT LAST MONTH DID THE NEEDS FOR RECYCLED WATER IN CALIFORNIA EXCEED TEN BILLION AND IN FACT THE NEEDS JUST FOR THE LA BASIN ALONE EXCEED TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IF YOU LOOK AT OPERATION NEXT TO THE UPGRADES TO HYPERION THAT ARE GONNA BE REQUIRED IN CARSON- FOR THE LARGER MET PROJECTS- WE DON'T. I DON'T REALLY SEE A LOT HERE ON. CONTINUING THAT THAT WATER RECYCLING PUSH AND EVEN LAST YEAR'S FUN WELL APPRECIATED I DON'T I THINK. DIDN'T BEGIN TO MEET THE NEEDS MAYBE OF BOTH THE VERY LARGE PROJECTS LIKE THE ONES I JUST MENTIONED BUT ALSO- SOME OF THE SMALLER WATER DISTRICTS. IN RURAL OR- SEMI RURAL AREAS THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO FINANCE THIS. THIS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ATTEMPT TO BE WATER RESILIENT OURSELVES SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO IMPORT AS MUCH FROM THE NORTH WE CAN TAKE PRESSURE OFF AGRICULTURE WE CAN TAKE PRESSURE OFF OF. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PRESSURE OFF THE DELTA- THESE ARE NO REGRETS INVESTMENT SO I JUST WANT TO GET. A QUICK. COMMENTER FEEDBACK FROM. YEAH WHOEVER'S APPROPRIATE SECRETARY BLUMENFELD MAY BE BASED ON YOUR YOUR PREVIOUS COMMENTS OR ANYONE ELSE- IN THIS INTEGRATED WATER WORLD THE ADMINISTRATION HOW YOU ALL ARE LOOKING AT- AT WATER RECYCLING STRATEGY GOING FORWARD. CAN I TAKE THAT THEIR SENATOR AND THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR EMPHASIS HERE ON WATER RECYCLING- AS CENTER DOLLY UP. TO ANSWER PART OF HIS QUESTION WHAT IS OUR STRATEGY HOW ARE WE ADDRESSING THESE LONG TERM TRENDS AS AS YOU SAID THE CERTIFICATION THAT'S HAPPENING BUT ALSO THIS BOOM AND BUST CYCLE AND WATER RECYCLING KEVIN IT'S CONSISTENT NATURE- AND- ABILITY TO REUSE WHAT'S OTHERWISE UNUSED- AND NOT PUT TO BENEFICIAL USE WATER CURRENTLY IS REALLY. CRITICAL IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO WE HERE AT THE STATE WATER BOARD- ALTHOUGH THERE AREN'T I KNOW THERE WAS A POT OF WATER RECYCLING DOLLARS IN THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE FIFTY MILLION OF WHICH WENT TO- SAN DIEGO AND I THINK THERE'S- STILL THAN AROUND FIFTY OR SO THAT WILL BE. LEFT TO CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR SITES THAT DIRECT POP IN THE STATE AND AS YOU MENTIONED A POTENTIAL FEDERAL POT FROM INTERIOR. WE ALSO FUND WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS OUT OF THE STATE REVOLVING FUNDS SO THE CLEAN WATER STATE REVOLVING FUND THE DRINKING WATER STATE REVOLVING FUND AND THEIR- IN THE COMING YEAR I BELIEVE JUST THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR WE'RE LOOKING TO FIND ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WORTH WATER RECYCLING TWENTY SEVEN. DIFFERENT WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE- AND THOSE ARE ALL. AND YOU KNOW REALLY APPRECIATE THE FOCUS AS WELL ON ACCOUNTABILITY THOSE ARE ALL ENUMERATED ARE INTENDED USE PLAN THAT'S OUR YEARLY LIST OF WHICH PROJECTS WILL RE RECEIVING FUNDING AS A ROLLING LIST BASED OFF THE APPLICATIONS THAT WE HAVE. TO THE STATE REVOLVING FUNDS AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY FUNNELING THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION WE RECEIVED LAST SUMMER AS WELL UP FOR DRINKING WATER WASTEWATER AND THERE THERE IS OPPORTUNITY AS WELL FOR FUNDING RECYCLING OF WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS SO IT'S A HUGE- TOP PRIORITY HERE DEFINITELY OF THE STATE BOARD. AS WE EVEN FUND SEPTIC TO SEWER PROJECTS THAT HELP CREATE THE FLOWS AND REALLY CONNECT THE DROPS IN A COMMUNITY AND ALLOW RECYCLING TO BE A CRITICAL. SOLUTION AND IN MANY COMMUNITY IS THAT ARE A LOS. OR SAN DIEGO IS FRAN. YOU KNOW THE BIG- YES MINISTER. ARE ABLE TO REALLY FIND THIS WORK WE WILL TRYING FOCUS AND MAKE SURE WE'RE WE'RE- THOSE. AND MEDIUM SIZE COMMUNITY. WERE RECYCLED CAN AND IMPORTANT. REALLY IT STRETCHING REPLIES AND BE A CRITICAL SO AND I THINK WE SEE A- DOCTOR- EXAMPLE OF THAT- WHERE TURLOCK SHERRY AND BUT ESTO YOUR ANSWER IS. ACTUALLY PROVIDE THEIR WATER ADULTS. RECYCLED WATER MAKES IT INTO THE- DOCUMENT. CANAL YOU KNOW THAT IS- THOSE ARE EXAM OF OCT AT. WE THAT WE TO WRAP THE STATE LEADERSHIP. TESTIFY AND AN EXCEL- WHAT RISK AS ONE OF THE MORE CRITICAL WE COULD POSSIBLY. FIVE THANK YOU FOR THE- CHURCH INTENDED USE REPORT AND- AND THEN DRILL DOWN DEEPER THERE BUT DO APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION OF THIS- IN THE SCALE OF NEED AT CERTAINLY OUTSTRIPPING OUR SUPPLY IN THE NEAR TERM HERE I WANTED TO ASK YOU ONE OTHER QUESTION- I THINK IT MAY BE FOR DIRECTOR NEMETH- BUT THE OTHER ANOTHER CRIME IMPACTED WE OFTEN DON'T TALK ABOUT CERTAINLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FLOODS- DESPITE BEING IN A MASSIVE FLOOD PLAIN AND HAVING TREMENDOUS RISKS WE KNOW THAT. THEY ALSO EXIST- IN THE FAR NORTH- WE'VE SEEN THE MODELS AND ANDERSON DAM- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE EVERYWHERE BUT PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T THINK OF THE LA AREA BEING AT RISK I WAS CURIOUS HOW I KNOW THE RESULTS WE DID THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FLOOD MANAGEMENT LAST YEAR THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME TO ME SOME EXCITING PROGRESS OCCURRING IN YOUR PART VERY COLLABORATION WITH HE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ON THIS ENGINEERING WITH NATURE INITIATIVE I JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR TAKE ON WHETHER. YOU THINK THERE ARE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FLOOD CONTROL INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND I DON'T SEE A LINE ITEM FOR THAT IN THE CURRENT PROPOSED DROUGHT RESPONSE ACTIVITIES BUT MAYBE JUST GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT WHAT YOU'RE UP TO THESE DAYS ON THAT POT FROM THE FLOOD CONTROL FRONT AND WHETHER THERE'S ANY HOPE FOR US AND SEVEN CALIFORNIA TO POTENTIALLY PARTNER WITH WITH T. W. AREN'T EVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN A PLACE LIKE CITY- YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT LAKE BALBOA THE- AS THE SPOT WHERE YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL A MASSIVE DAM- AND WE TO SPREADING GROUNDS- RIGHT IN THE AREA BUT- THAT. YOU KNOW WE WE'D RATHER NOT JUST HARD ENGINEER OUR WAY THROUGH ALL THIS AND JUST BUILD UP FLOOD FLOOD- CANALS AND INSTEAD TRY TO FIND WAYS TO SAY EXPAND NATIVE WETLANDS OR USE OTHER. CERTAIN NATURE BASED INFRASTRUCTURE SO. K. YOU JUST GIVE A LITTLE MOVE INSIGHT ON HOW THINGS ARE UP FLOW CONTROL. AND MAYBE OUTLOOK FOR SEVEN. ABSOLUTELY SENATOR AND THAT'S A TERRIFIC QUEST SO. A COUPLE OF THINGS THERE- YOU KNOW AS A GENERAL MATTER- THE DEPARTMENT IS COMPLETING- OR AT LEAST STARTING ON ITS UPDATE OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S LEGISLATED- HAD MANDATED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT D. W. R. UPDATE EVERY- EVERY FIVE YEARS. SO THE THRUST OF THIS- THIS UPDATE IS IT IS REALLY CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND TAKING A WATERSHED SCALE LOOK. AT HOW WE NOT ONLY PROVIDE FOR AWHILE- THESE MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS THAT ALSO- ENHANCE FLOOD PROTECTION FOR COMMUNITIES SO- YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THESE PIECES FIT TOGETHER. AND THAT WILL SUGGEST- FUTURE APPROACHES TO FUNDING THAT- MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS EVEN STRONGER- THAN THAN WE'VE BEEN DOING REALLY IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS- AS PART OF PROPOSITION ONE- YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT WE HAD- HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN THERE FOR WHAT WE CALL MULTI BENEFIT FLOOD PROTECTION- AND THOSE ARE THE DOLLARS THAT- THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN. EXPANDING ON- OUR URBAN WRIST WORK URBAN RISK FLOOD REDUCTION PROGRAM- AND OTHER KINDS OF GRANT PROGRAMS THAT CAN DO THE THINGS THAT- THAT YOU DESCRIBE WE HAD WE ARE HAVING GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS. AND ON THEIR ENGINEERING WAS WITH NATURE- WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM TO IDENTIFY SOME PILOT PROJECTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT- THERE IS A- THE- A LIST OF- KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IS LOOKING TO FUND- THROUGH THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE. BILL AND WE ARE RIGHT NOW PARTNERING WITH THE BOARD OF ENGINEERS TO UNDERSTAND THOSE BETTER AND IDENTIFY THOSE PLACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT- THAT. ARE OPPORTUNE. FOR THIS KIND OF- ENGINEERING WITH NAY BUT ALSO. A REAL TIGHT- INTEGRATE BETWEEN. BENEFITS AND WATER SUPPLY IN OVERALL CLIMATE. RESILIENCY I WOULD SAY. AS A AS A GENERAL MATTER THE OTHER THING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS TRACKING VERY CLOSELY WHICH IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S- THAT WATER RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO IS UNDERSTANDING- BETTER WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM- AS A GENERAL MATTER CALIFORNIA PAYS MORE INTO THAT PROGRAM AND THEN WE SEE COMING BACK TO CALIFORNIA- AND- PART OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHEN WE LOOK AT- THE- SORT OF NEXT. STRATEGY FOR FUNDING NEXT GENERATION FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECTS IS. WHAT WE NEED TO DO- RELATIVE TO- INTERACTINGWITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THAT NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM- THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER LARA'S OFFICE TO- AGAIN IT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE PROGRAMS- COULD WORK IN THE FUTURE ESPECIALLY WITH INCREASED RISK WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. SO WE ARE VERY MUCH MOVING THROUGH THE DOLLARS THAT- HAS BEEN HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED FOR THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS- AND ULTIMATELY THROUGH THE WATER PLAN BUT ALSO THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN. IT'S THAT DOESN'T EXTEND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND ITS FOCUS ON YOU KNOW OUR OUR WITH OUR MAJOR AT ST- PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL WHICH- COVERS THOSE SAN JOAQUIN IN THE SACRAMENTO SYSTEMS BUT- I SAY THAT AS A- AN EMPHASIS ON. THAT DOCUMENT COMBINED WITH THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLANT OUR OUR GO FORWARD- DOCUMENTS TO DO THE THINGS THAT YOU- THAT YOU ARE POINTING OUT AS- REALLY THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS FROM FLOOD- I'D BE GLAD TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATION WITH A YOU AND YOUR STAFF- OFFLINE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PROJECTS LOCAL TO YOUR AREA. OR THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE SEEING THERE'S REALLY INTERESTING ONES. UNDER WAY- IN MERCED COUNTY- WE'VE HAD SOME NOVEL APPROACHES- IN THE PAPAROA AREA- AND SENATOR LAYER DISTRICT WHERE WE HAD. MULTIPLE CHALLENGES RELATED TO GROUNDWATER RELATED TO SALMON RESTORATION AND RELATED TO FLOOD PROTECTION SO THERE'S A. LOT OF GOOD THINGS HAPPENING IN THE STATE. YOU CAN- LOOK TO THE TO BRING TO BE PROVIDING A BRA- GO FORWARD THROUGH THESE THESE TWO PRIME- LET'S JUST MANDATE PLAN DOCUMENTS THAT THE- IS PREPARING RIGHT NOW- THANK YOU FOR THAT- RE DIRECT AND WE WILL BE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT TO APPRECIATE THE WALK THROUGH. I KNOW. I KNOW THE ALAMEDA CREEK PROJECT WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN THE STATE WATER. RESOURCES BOARD HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS I THINK WE'RE ON THE THIRD YEAR AND ESSENTIALLY THIS IS A PROJECT THAT TAKES EXISTING RIVER. AND SO THAT WE CAN TO WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FISHERIES IMPROVEMENT- ALSO SEA LEVEL RISES WORKED THE CALCULATIONS IS GONNA CUT IS GOING TO MODIFY UP TO ONE FOOT A C. LEVEL RISE. AND WHILE THE COURT HAS SIGNED OFF ON THE PERMITTING. THE WATER RESOURCE BOARD THE D. W. R. HAVE NOT AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THERE'S CEMENTED. RIVERS STORE AUTHORED THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE'D LIKE TO SEE THOSE PROJECTS TO WIN AND WE DON'T WANT TO REALLY WAIT THREE OR FOUR YEARS FOR. REGULATING COMMUNITY TO DO THAT SO THAT'S JUST SUCH. A WEIRD OF CONCERN. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE HOLD THIS ITEM SO ITEM NUMBER FIFTY SEVEN WE WILL HOLD AND MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FIFTY. EIGHT WHICH IS THE FARMS- THE FARM TO SCHOOL PROGRAM SECRETARY ROSS- GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK WITH OUR FOLKS I SEE THAT THE CALIO RECOMMENDS THAT WE REJECT THE OFFER. FOR INTERESTED ON YOUR ON THAT. WHAT IS THE PROPER TO THANK YOU FOR MUCH ON THE FARM PREP IS- PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BY. I DON'T KNOW MAN OF THIRTY TWO POINT EIGHT FIVE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR GRANTS TO SCHOOLS AND I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN JUST A MOMENT IT ALSO INCLUDES- AT FUNDING FOR STAFFING SIXTEEN REGIONAL STAFF MEMBERS TO HELP BUILD OUT THIS NETWORK TO TRULY MAKE THIS PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL. SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY THIS PROGRAM IS SO IMPORTANT AT ONE MAJOR REASON IS THAT LAST YEAR WE STARTED ONE BILLION MEALS IN SCHOOLS AND THAT WAS IN THE MIDST OF A OF A PANDEMIC BUT THAT MANY MANY CHALLENGES THAT OUR SCHOOL NUTRITION DIRECTORS HAD ADMINISTRATORS AND FAMILIES. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SCHOOL MEALS AS AS EVEN MORE ACUTE. NOW THAN IT EVER HAS BEEN. THIS PRESS. IS ABOUT NENE'S. WHO THIS IS GAME OF INTEREST MILK THEY'LL GET AND CASES UNFORTUNATELY IT MAY NOT IT MAY BE THE ONLY KNOW THAT THEY GET. IN THE SCHOOL DAY AND SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS AS WE FIGHT HUNGER AND IMPROVE SECURITY. BUT WHAT I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE ABOUT THIS IS THAT IS A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO SCHOOL MALES. TO BUILDING OUT AND IMPROVING THE RESILIENCY OF LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS BY EXPANDING LOCAL PROCUREMENT BY OUR LARGEST INSTITUTIONS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING THAT CAME OUT LAST YEAR ONE OF THE EARLY COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE AND THAT. IS THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE ABOUT HEALTHY AGING IN EVERY DECADE. AND THOSE YOUNG DECADES ARE THE PLACES WHERE WE CAN MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE I'VE CITING HEALTH CARE'S HEALTHCARE COSTS BY REDUCING CHRONIC DISEASE BY IMPROVING NUTRITION AND HOW WE EAT AND HOW WE EXERCISE STARTING FROM THE YOUNGEST AGES- BCP WOULD ALLOW US TO EXPAND ON A PILOT PROGRAM. THAT WE HAD IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OR TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT PROGRAM WAS OVER SUBSCRIBED WE HAD OVER EIGHTY APPLICATIONS AT THAT TIME. AND TWENTY TWENTY WE WORK AT FIRST PARTNER JENNIFER SIEBEL. NEWSOM TO REALLY. BRING TOGETHER STAKEHOLDERS IN A WORKGROUP PROCESS SO IN TWENTY TWENTY WE ADDED AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE LEARNING ABOUT THIS ONE TO BE A PART OF THAT. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HOSTED A STATEWIDE CONFERENCE FOR SCHOOL APPS FARM TO SCHOOL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS SCHOOL GARDEN PROGRAMS. AND ADDED ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED STAKEHOLDERS THE PARTIES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DOING BEST- AND SO WE WILL WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS BY RELEASING A GRANT PROGRAM THIS YEAR FOR THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THIS. FISCAL YEAR'S BUDGET WE EXPECT THAT TO BE. HEAVILY OVERSUBSCRIBED BASED ON THE INTEREST WE HAVE. BASED ON THE ADDITION STEAK OUT AND- THAT WE DONE. AND WE FEEL THAT HAVING A TOTAL OF SIX MILLION NEXT AS I DID THE RIGHT TIME NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THIS ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND WE NOW HAVE THAT CHANCE INTEREST IN THIS PROGRAM. BUT ALSO THE PANDEMIC REALLY COMPOUNDED FOR PEOPLE THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT MANY OF US ARE FEELING WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO SHORTEN THAT SUPPLY CHAIN THE BRING IT CLOSER TO HOME TO BE ABLE TO FIND AN SOURCE MARK HEALTHY CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCTS THAT ARE CLOSER TO HOME. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY TO COMBINE THAT WITH NUTRITION EDUCATION WITH EXPERIENCE OLD LEARNING EDUCATION THAT REALLY TREATS THE WHOLE CHILD AND LEARNING ABOUT WHERE FOOD COMES COMES FROM ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ABOUT ALL OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN TEACH MATH AND SCIENCE MY SCHOOL GARDENS AND THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE A LEARNING. EQUALLY IMPORTANT THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT ALSO PUT EMPHASIS ON SOURCING LOCALLY FROM SMALL HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED FARMERS SO THAT THEY HAVE AN OUTLET FOR THE FOR THEIR PRODUCTIVITY CLOSE TO HOME WHERE THEY KNOW THAT THEY KNOW WHO THEY'RE SELLING IT TO WE'RE HELPING TO BUILD OUT COMMUNITY. AND WE FEEL THAT WITH JUST ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S PROPOSED FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR WE CAN MAKE A TRULY HAD START TRANSFORMING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS KIND OF HEALTHY FOOD OFFERINGS AVAILABLE FOR THE LONG TERM FUTURE- WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES. WITH THESE KINDS OF GRANT DOLLARS THE POSITION OUR LOCAL EDUCATION UNITS ARE LOCAL SCHOOLS WITH THEIR NUTRITION DIRECTORS AND WITH OUR LOCAL PRODUCERS ALSO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THESE FUNDS FOR INDIVIDUAL GRANTS THAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE COMING AVAILABLE THROUGH THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. I KNOW THAT WE'VE DONE OVER TIME TO GET A AND SO I BRUSHED THROUGH THAT PRESENTATION- BUT I VERY OFTEN THIS BASED ON THE THAT WE DONE. THAT WE WILL BE OVER. FOR A PROBE AND CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. AND WHAT WELL MESSAGE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AS BEING AS FOR NEXT FISCAL YEAR THANK YOU. AND BEFORE I GET TO THE L. A. L. YOU YOU SET THE CURRENT YEAR'S GRANT APPLICATIONS ARE GOING OUT CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE OF WHAT THE LANDSCAPE LOOKS LIKE PUT THE FARMERS MARKETS I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED FARMERS CITY DO THAT BUT IT SEEMS LIKE ALL THESE FARMERS MARKETS ARE ALL OVER. THE ALL OVER THE STATE THEY GET TO THE END OF THE MARKET AND THEY GOT ALL THAT X. X. X. AS- VEGETABLES IN EXCESS. SOMETIMES A PACK UP SOMETIMES YOU TRY TO. READ THE DUMP IT OFFERED I DON'T KNOW WE'RE THE GRANT APPLICATIONS WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE THAT INTERSECTION BETWEEN. YOUR DEPARTMENT THE SCHOOLS THE MAIN MARKET MANAGER FOR THESE FARMERS MARKET SAID THAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S SOMEBODY TO CONNECT THE DOTS THERE. I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S A GREAT OBSERVATION AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE'VE DONE WELL THERE'S SEVERAL WAYS THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT ONE IT'S WITH A REALLY STRONG PARTNERSHIP CALLED FAMILY. FARM TO FAMILY THAT IS A PARTNERSHIP. WITH OUR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS. AND WE'VE REALLY DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE THE OFFERINGS AND THOSE FAMILY TWO BOXES BY PUTTING SO MUCH MORE FRESH PRODUCE INTO BAT. AND SO MANY OF OUR FARMERS MARKETS DO YOU HAVE AN EXISTING PARTNERSHIP THERE FOR THOSE FARMERS WHO WANT TO DONATE THAT. PRODUCT AND MORE AND MORE SHOULD BANKS ARE ALSO BEING ABLE TO BECAUSE OF THE INFUSION OF INVESTMENTS UNDER- SOME OF THAT FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND BEEN ABLE TO DO MARK PROCUREMENT. AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SOURCE NOT ONLY FROM THE LARGER FARMS WHICH IS A VERY EFFICIENT WAY OF GETTING BULK PURCHASES MADE. BUT ALSO TRYING TO SOURCE MORE AND MORE LOCALLY. WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF. OF SUPPORTING PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND ALSO OFFERING MORE ETHNICALLY DIVERSE TYPES OF OFFERINGS AND ALSO BOXES. BUT BEING ABLE TO INSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTIONAL BUYING AT THE SCALE OF THE SCHOOL'S. OF FARMERS MARKET IS NOT WELL SUITED FOR THAT THEY NEED TO BUY. A CERTAIN SCALE THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME. RELIABILITY OF HOW MUCH THEY CAN GET AT WHAT TIMES OF THE YEARS WHEN THE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN AND SERVING HIS LUNCHES. AND SO THIS IS REALLY TRYING TO BUILD OUT. A LOCAL FOOD SYSTEM. THAT CAN BETTER MATCH WHAT'S BEING GROWN IN THAT AREA. AND NOW WITH THE MARKETS ARE. INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE WEEKLY FARMERS MARKET AND HELPING THIS IS WHAT I STYLE AND ALSO ALL OF THAT. IT'S REALLY MATCHING WHERE THE DEMAND YES. AND ALIGNING THAT WITH WHAT'S BEING GROWN IN THE AREA. THIS WE ALSO HAVE A FOOD AB PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAY FUNDED THIS YEAR. THAT WILL HELP WITH SOME OF THE AGRIC. BUT THAT'S REALLY BEEN THE MISSING LINK TO REAL TRY CLOSE. SCHOOL NUTRITION DIRECTOR. PLANNING APPLES FOR THE YEAR BEING A TO CONNECT. WITH LOCAL FARMERS TO KNOW WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND THEN A LINE THAT DEMAND. AND WHAT'S AVAILABLE- FROM THE- FROM THE FARMERS- THAT'S THAT OUR FARMERS MARKETS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. BUT THAT'S NOT THE GREATEST AT FOUR FOR THE KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL BUYING THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING YOUR FOR THE SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM. OKAY I KNOW AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW DURING THIS CAN GET MAKE MANY OF MEMBERS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN FOOD GIVEAWAYS BECAUSE THAT. THE FOOD BANKS HAVE EXPLODED AND I KNOW THAT THE GROCERY STORES IT SAID- LITTLE KNOWN FACT THAT DATE WHEN THEIR VEGETABLES REACHED THE POINT WHERE THEY DON'T WANT TO SELL THAT THEIR DONATING SOME OF THAT TO THE FOOD BANKS IN GOING IN S. BUT IF I'M SURE WE WANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE NEED IS GREAT THERE IS A LOT OF HUNGRY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW CHIPSTER. ONE OPTION FRESH FRUIT IS ANOTHER OPTION- SO. WHAT WILL BE INTERESTED IN AND HOW THAT GOES ON- LET'S HEAR FROM THE ALLEY- BEFORE HERE'S WHAT FINANCING GIVE. IF YOUR COMMENTS ARE CHAIR ON THIS PROGRAM. YEAH AM GOING MISTER CHANG COMMITTEE MEMBERS FRANK MENACE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO THIS PROPOSAL HAS TWO COMPONENTS THERE'S TWO POINT NINE MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND AN ONGOING FOR SIXTEEN REGIONAL STATUS SECRETARY ROSS MENTION. AND THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME FOR THE FARM TO SCHOOL INCUBATOR GRANT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES. GRANTS TO SCHOOLS TO PARTICULAR QUICKLY SEARCH FOODS AND ALSO PROVIDE ON EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT- BRIDGE THE CAFETERIA IN THE CLASSROOM- FOR THIS PROPOSAL RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED FUNDING FOR THE SIXTEEN REGIONAL STAFF. WE FIND AT THE REGIONAL STAFF COULD BETTER SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND IMPLEMENTING FARM TO SCHOOL PRACTICES BY TELLING TAILORING MEANS THE SCHOOL THEY HAVE SIMILAR REGIONAL BARRIERS IN IMPLEMENTING THESE PRACTICES. HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION FOR THE FARM TO SCHOOL INCUBATOR GRANT PROGRAM- AS YOU RECALL THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PACKAGE PROVIDED- THEIR TRAINING FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM THIRTY MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND THIRTY MILLION IN THE BUDGET HERE SO THERE'S FUNDING FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM- IN THE BUDGET. YEAR BASED ON ACTIONS TAKEN LAST YEAR- BUDGET ALSO INCLUDED SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING. FOR THE TO REPORT BACK ON PROGRAMMATIC OUTCOMES BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WE FIND THAT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD BE PREMATURE BEFORE THESE OUTCOMES ARE REPORTED ON- WE ALSO FIND THAT THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES ON WHETHER THEY'LL BE DEMAND FOR SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS AND AVAILABLE GRANTS AT THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO APPROVE THIS ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION. I'M FOR THE FIRST- GRANT CYCLE FOR THE PROGRAM BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE DEPARTMENT MADE AVAILABLE IN A HALF MILLION IN GRANTS AND ONLY RECEIVE TWELVE MILLION. AND TOTAL REQUEST- SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THE DEMAND IS GOING TO BE THERE FOR THE ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTY MILLION NOBODY HERE. AND THEN WE FIND THAT A TWO YEAR INCREASE FROM IN A HALF MILLION TO SIXTY MILLION AS A RELATIVELY LARGE INCREASE FOR A NEW PROGRAM- THEN THOSE ARE COMMENTS AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS- MR DEALER FINANCE. STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE SORT OF. HOLD THE ITEM WE SEE WHAT. HAPPENS IN TWO WEEKS WITH THE GRANT PROGRAM WILL ALLOW YOU GUYS TO COME BACK. TO PROVIDE US WITH SOME MORE INFORMATION SO WE LOOK AT THE- TOTALITY OF THIS BRAND NEW PROGRAM- YOUR COMMENTS LITTLE ROCK DID A GREAT JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INVESTMENT THE ONLY THING ALL ALL AT ON YOU. IS THAT THIS IS PART OF A LARGER- YOUR NUTRITION INVESTMENT ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING AND THERE'S OTHER COMPONENTS WITHIN THE EDUCATION BUDGET BUT DEFINITELY. THERE'S ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONE I PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND OVER THREE YEARS THE HELP OF A BRIEF ALTERCATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT. THAT BETTER INCORPORATE MORE FRESH AND MINIMALLY PROCESSED CALIFORNIA GROWN SCHOOLS WILL MEAL AND LIVE PART OF A OF A LARGER ADMINISTRATION EFFORT- THE COMPUTER ACCORDING TO CHRISTIAN AND- CALIFORNIA I'M GOING TO THAT THOUGH- I AGAIN YOU KNOW WILL WILL BE KIND OF WHAT THE APPLICATION LOOK LIKE BUT I. MENTIONED YOU KNOW GIVEN THE OTHER INCREASE DISCUSSION WE HAD OUR LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT PROGRAM AT REALLY KIND OF YOU STARTED YOU KNOW WE THERE'S BEEN. REGROW SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS. NOT ONLY HAVE LETTER. METAL SHOP SOME WHICH ARE AND- DEPART. THE- BE LIQUIDATED BUT ALSO THEIR CAPITA THEY GONE TO YOU KNOW THEY JUST BRING IT ON DON'T KNOW HOW TO BOY WATER ON THIS SIDE OR THE- TRAIN PEOPLE WHICH IS ANOTHER. YOU KNOW SO WE GREAT TO. IT'S GREAT TO WANT THEM TO TEACH BUT A LOT OF FROM OUR WILL BACK AND SAY WE NOW WE HAVE SOME STANDARD OR WHATEVER WE WANT TO DO SO IT'S THAT LIKE A NO. TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE IN THE TRENCHES TO SEE REALLY YOU DON'T PREPARE THE FOOD IN THE CAFETERIA BUT- THAT'S A TO BE DONE. TO ADDRESS LATER I DON'T SEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES SO WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT ON HERE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT HI- HEARING ON THE UPDATES. SILVA I'VE NEVER FIFTY EIGHT FOR ISSUE NUMBER FIFTY EIGHT IS DEALT WITH LET'S BRING BACK A DIRECTOR BOTTOM AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WE HAVE. ITEM NUMBER IF ISSUE NUMBER FIFTY NINE THE WHALE AND SEA TURTLE SEA FISHERIES AND NISHA TO- YOU'RE ASKING FOR MONEY FROM THE E. L. P. F. F. RATHER THAN AN INCREASE IN FEES WHILE THE QUESTIONS OF STAFF IS. ASKED PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU CHAIR. SO IT IS THE BOTTOM LINE. AS OF TODAY CALIFORNIA IS POISED TO BE THE FIRST STATE IN DIS UNITED STATES DAPPER TRULY. WHALE AND SEE TOTAL SAFE COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHERIES. WE ARE THE FIRST STATE THAT'S EVER SAW THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT FOR HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN THAT COVERS SUCH LARGE MAJESTIC YOU KNOW MARINE MAMMALS AS WHALES AND SEA TURTLES. WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT EVERYONE ELSE. HAS IT BEEN HARD ABSOLUTELY. HAS IT BEEN FULL OF CONTENTION AND OFTEN VERY HEATED ARGUMENT BETWEEN IMPORTANT COMMUNITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT NO TELL. SENATOR MCGUIRE DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR WORKING THROUGH THIS WITH THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES IN THE DEPARTMENT. WE SEEK THREE YEARS OF FUNDING. AND. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND THE SAME IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND THIS WOULD SUPPORT THREE LIMITED TERM. STAFF TO START THE INITIAL. AND WHAT IS THE INITIATIVE LET ME ANSWER ALL THE STAFF QUESTIONS ON PAGE SIXTY FOUR SO WHY V. E. L. P. S. WELL IT ACTUALLY SAYS PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION. AUTHORIZES THE USE OF THE LICENSE PLATE FUND FOR PROTECTION OF NON GAME SPECIES AND THREATENED AND ENDANGERED PLANTS AND ANIMALS. PERHAPS IRONICALLY YOU CAN ALSO HAVE A LICENSE TAG IN THIS STATE THAT AS A WHALE TAIL ON IT- THE QUESTION ALSO CONTINUES WHY NOT. BE INCREASE MMHM THREE REASONS. FIRST THE DEPARTMENT ONLY HAS ONE SPECIFIC ACCOUNT FOR DUNGEONS CRAB AND THAT'S FUND IS LIMITED TO ADMINISTRATING- CRAB TRAP PROGRAM AND IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO BE USED FOR ANY OTHER PROGRAM. FOR PURPOSE SECOND REASON WE TRIED TO RAISE COMMERCIAL LANDING FEES A FEW OF YOU WERE ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE AT THE TIME THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND JUST SPEAKING PERSONALLY I BARELY SURVIVED WE REMEMBER. OUR MEMBERS. LASTLY. YOU KNOW YOU COULD MAKE A LEGITIMATE CASE THEY'RE JUST NOT INDUSTRY FUNDS IT'S A CHALLENGING TIME TO BE A HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN OR WOMAN LIVING ON THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING. ENGINE THINGS IN THE OCEAN. THERE'S A BROAD PUBLIC BENEFIT TO PROTECT THAT ANNECTENS FEDERALLY PROTECTED WHALES AND SEA TURTLES. AND AT THE SAME TIME ENSURE A- VIABLE AND EQUALLY ICONIC DUNGEONS SCRIPTURE. NEXT QUESTION WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS WELL I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED ITS FIRST IN THE NATION KIND OF WORK THAT'S STUFF WE SHOULD BE PRODUCT BUT MOREOVER. ITSELF PIONEERING APPROACH I MEAN IT'S THIS IS CUTTING EDGE. WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO AND HAVE BEEN DOING FOR A COUPLE YEARS IN A TEST PROGRAM WHICH WOULD NOW BE APPROVED. WE HELD BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'RE DOING WELL OBSERVATIONS FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES INCLUDING OCEANOGRAPHIC AND CLIMATE DATA SOCIOECONOMIC SUITE DYNAMICS AND IMPROPER INPUTS SCIENTISTS. FISHERMEN WOMEN AND NON PROFITS TO EVALUATE THE RISK OF OUR FISHING IN TANGLING THESE MARINE MAMMALS IN THE REAL TIME MOMENT. IN FOR SEVERAL MONTHS EACH YEAR WE ARE LOOKING THIS DATA REAL TIME AT A WAY THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE ANYWHERE I WOULD ARGUE IN THE WORLD. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING THAT'S WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH. WE'RE LEARNING FROM IT OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING FOLLOWING OUR LEAD. AND WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ON THE DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY. COULD EVENTUALLY BE APPLIED TO OUR OTHER STATE FISHERIES. BETTER FIXED GEAR LIKE LOBSTER ROCK ROBIN SPOT PRAWN WHICH MAY ALSO HAVE LIABILITY EXPOSURE IF ANYONE WERE TO DECIDE TO CHALLENGE. LASTLY STAFF ASKS IS THERE A GUARANTEE IF WE DO THIS THEY'LL BE NO LEGAL RISK NOW I CAN'T OFFER YOU THAT GUARANTEED WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS. WE WERE SUED CALIFORNIA THE DEPARTMENT AND ME PERSONALLY IN MY OFFICIAL CAPACITY. FOR POSSIBLE LIABILITY UNDER THE FEDERAL ESA. BECAUSE WHAT'S CALLED TAKE ARM THE WHALES AND SEA TURTLES WAS HAPPENING. THE STATE'S LIABILITY FOR THAT ALLEGED VIOLATION CONTINUES UNTIL WE GET A FEDERAL PERMIT. AND THIS FUNDING IS FOR THE PURPOSES OF GETTING THAT FEDERAL PERMIT. COULD I GET STUDENT FUTURE PRESSURE I'LL TELL YOU. SOME OF THE MOST MADDENING PARTS OF THE JOB WE'RE PRETTY REGULARLY SUED ON AN ISSUE AT THE SAME TIME ONE COMMUNITIES SUCH AS WERE NOT PROTECTIVE ENOUGH FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THE OTHER COMMUNITY MAY SAY WE'RE TOO PROTECTIVE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. SO THERE'S RISK IN THE FUTURE. BUT THIS FUNDING REALLY REDUCES THE RISK BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO GET THE FEDERAL PERMITS. HI THERE THANK YOU I GUESS I CAN TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT FOR PURPOSES OF A ISSUE FOR FIFTY NINE. LET'S GO TO MS ASSERT THOUGH- WITH FINANCED YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ON THAT OF THE DIRECTOR'S PRESENTATION. I AM KAPLAN ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THANK YOU PARTICULAR TO ADD BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. BROUGH LET'S GO TO A- THE L. A. L. PERFECT COLOR. MISTER CHAIR RICH EITHER SO DALY OUT I WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL THAT GIVEN IT IS A REALLY NEW INITIATIVE AND NEW APPROACH THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY LEARN FAMILY MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH IT COMMITTEE ASKING THE DEPARTMENT TO COME BACK AND PERCENT- YOU KNOW SOMEWHAT REGULARLY ANNUALLY PERHAPS- ON ON PROGRESS AND WHAT WE'RE LEARNING- AND- CHALLENGES FOR ENCOUNTERING. COULD BE COULD BE THROUGH FORMAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE OR JUST INFORMALLY- GIVEN THIS COULD BE A PROMISING PRACTICE WE CAN PURSUE IN THE FUTURE BUT NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. UNDERSTOOD ASSEMBLY WIRE YOU HAVE A QUESTION. ARTISTIC A COMMENT HERE- ON THE ISSUE OF FEES AND I JUST AND I THINK THAT WE ALL LIVED. THE DREAM THAT YEAR WHEN AS THE POTENTIAL OF RAISING FEES TO ASTRONOMICAL AMOUNTS ON A STRUGGLING FLEET SO- I AGREE WITH THE DIRECTOR THAT HOPE THAT WE DON'T SEE THAT COME BACK AGAIN ESPECIALLY SINCE WE PUT THAT CALL IN THEIR NUMBER ONE IN THE NUMBER TWO I THINK FROM THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN A LOT OF COORDINATION. AND IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE TO SEE THE FLEET COMING TOGETHER EVEN WHEN THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY- ALTERNATIVES TO POTENTIAL. OF THAT GEAR ADDED TO OTHER PIECES- THEY'VE ACTUALLY CLOSED PROACTIVELY WHEN THEIR WHALES AT. PRESENT IN THE- HARTMAN ALONG WITH THE FLEET ARE AND- COMMUNICATION- AND I'LL JUST USE THIS YEAR AS AN EXAMPLE- THE DIRECTOR AND I WERE ABLE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE FLEET THREE TIMES PRIOR TO OPENING. AN IN REAL TIME THANKS TO THE INVESTMENTS OF THIS LEGISLATURE ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR I'D BE ABLE TO GIVE REAL DATA WHERE THE WELLS ARE AT. WHEN THEY ANTICIPATE THERE CAN BE MOVING OUT AND IT WORKED AND I THINK THAT- I DO SO BUT WE NEVER GO BACK TO THE RAISING OF FEES. BECAUSE THAT WAS. CHURCHES THANK YOU. CENTER STERN IF APPROPRIATE LIKE MAKE A MOTION ON THE ITEM THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO APPROVE AS- AS BUDGET ARM. THAT WILL TREAT IT AS A MOTION TO APPROVE ITEM NUMBER FIFTY NINE. IF THERE'S NO OTHER COMMENTS BY DIRECTOR BOTTOM. CLEARLY- SEEING NONE. BUT WE WERE LATER OTHERS MOSHE OKAY WE'LL TAKE THE MOTION BY SICK BY CENTER STERN WILL DEAL WITH THAT WE DO ALL THE VOTES BECAUSE WE HAVE ONE MORE ISSUE AND THEN WILL OPEN UP A PUBLIC COMMENT. FROM LOOKS CHECK A SURE- ASK OF ALL AND THE DELTA DELTA PROGRAM FUNDING CONVERSION IN OPPOSITION TO TORY THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER SIXTY. PETER APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ITEM- SO AS YOU WELL KNOW WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF UPDATING THE WHAT BAY DELTA WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN UPDATE- THIS REQUEST IS TO TAKE WHAT ARE OTHERWISE CONTRACT RESOURCES AND CONVERT THEM TO PERSONAL UP PERMANENT PERSONNEL- BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY NEEDING TO HAVE THAT LONG TERM CONSISTENCY AND IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ENGAGING AND- AND CONTINUE TO ENGAGE AND- AS WE UPDATE THE WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN- AS WE TALK ABOUT DECISION MAKING AROUND. GROUND WATER RECHARGE OR ANY POTENTIAL STORAGE HERE IN THE STATE I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE HOW REALLY IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THE WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN UPDATE IS UPDATED SO WE HAVE UPDATED STANDARDS TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THOSE CRITICAL PROJECTS THE LAST TIME THE WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN UPDATE- WAS UPDATED WAS IN THE MID NINETIES SINCE THEN THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT HAS TAKEN OVER AND REALLY. PROVIDED A SINGLE SPECIES APPROACH TO WHAT WE KNOW OUR WATERSHED Y. CHALLENGES IN THE DELTA WATERSHED SO- REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS ITEM AND. CUT- TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. FORGET FINANCE. YOU'RE EITHER PART OF MINE IS GOING TO COMMENT AT THAT POINT BUT TO HELP AND- OKAY- L. A. R. Y. THE FIVE DIGIT FIVE PER POSITION WITHIN THE STATE WATER FOR YOU HAVE COMMENT. AND WE THAT AGAIN RETAILER ARE DOING WE DIDN'T ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSED IT SEEMS JUSTIFIED AS THERE MAY THAT TO INTO THE NEXT OF. WORKING ON THE PLAN AMENDMENTS IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE MORE RESOURCES INTERNALLY RATHER THAN CONTRACT AND I THINK AS IT AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA THE MAIN POINT WE WANTED TO MAKE IS JUSTICE THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT EFFORT FOR THE STATE ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENING. TO THE NATIVE SPECIES IN THE DELTA AS WELL AS CONCERNS ABOUT UNCERTAINTY FOR WATER USERS ABOUT WHAT WENT ON THE HORIZON SO GETTING THIS DONE IS REALLY SHOULD BE HIGH PRIORITY AND HAS TAKEN A LONG TIME SO ARE THERE OTHER STEPS LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE TO HELP ESCALATE THIS PROCESS AND MOVE A LONG. WAY JUST REALLY IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND WE THINK PERHAPS AREAS TO PURSUE IF THERE ARE STEPS TO GET THIS IMPORTANT. STATE PRIORITY ACCOMPLISHED. WHAT ABOUT THAT YOU'RE A CABALLERO FLETCHER I. SOME FUNDING IS NEEDED TO FINISH THE JOB WORK WE WILL GET IT IS A CHANGING- SEEN THAT WE HAVE WITH WITH THE TROUT AND DIFFERENT TENSIONS THERE THAN IT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHEN THE LAST BE PLANNED BUT- NO STAFF IS ASKING EITHER INTERIM STEPS THAT WE CAN DO TO GET SOME SORT OF RESOLVE TO MOVE US TO. A MEANINGFUL BAY DELTA PLAN. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION WHAT WE HAVE RECENTLY IS SORRY INFORMATIONAL ITEMS ACTUALLY- JUST THIS PAST DECEMBER REGARDING WHERE THE STATUS IS OF THE UPDATE WHAT THE TIME LINES ARE. AS WE LOOK AT THAT TO THE YEARS AHEAD HERE- AND MOMENTS FOR ENGAGEMENT IMPORTANTLY SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS YEAR ON MOVING ALONG THE DISCUSSION AND YOUR POINT PROVIDED SOME CLARITY JUST ON. HOW HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- VIEWING THE PROJECT AND WHEN IT COMES TO THAT ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCE REQUEST WILL. WELL AT THIS POINT WHERE WE ARE WAITING TO SEE- BUT VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS MATERIALIZE AND OF TH SECRETARIES ARE VERY MUCH PRIORITIZING THOSE. THAT ALSO WILL HAVE IMPACT ON WHAT WHAT EXACTLY ARE PROJECT COMPLETELY LOOKS LIKE YES THIS REQUEST FOR THE CONVERSION FOR THE PERMANENT. FIVE PERMANENT POSITIONS AT THIS POINT REALLY FULFILLS WHAT THIS RESOURCE NEED THERE WHERE WHERE AND A FINE. BUT NOW AS ALWAYS WILL WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROJECT AND WE NEED ADDITIONAL. THAT WILL WILL HAVE DISCUSSION. I'M SURE ALL KEEP OUR EYES THOSE THAT TO CAPE- WATER RIGHT PROCEED CENTER. ON FIVE CONTINUE REQUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCHER I'LL BE TWO MINUTES OR LESS- ON ITEM NUMBER SIXTY FIRST AND FOREMOST I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO CHAIR ASK ABOUT. A TERRACE GROSSMAN IN TOUCHING INVOLVED IN NOT JUST IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS WITHIN THE KLAMATH RIVER WATERSHED THE RIVER WATERSHED THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE- A&amp;E HE'S EVERYWHERE IN TO THE GRATEFUL FOR HIS HARD WORK ESPECIALLY. IN THIS PAST DIFFICULT YEAR IN FACT I WANNA TALK ABOUT. THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE ESPECIALLY SINCE THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT NOT JUST IN THE STATE BUT IN THE WEST. AND CONTINUES TO HAVE INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES IN THE CHAIRS. ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS SO THIS MAY BE A QUESTION FOR THE CHAIR OR FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.% BUT THE FIRST CURTAILMENT ORDERS NEED TIRE CITY CALIFORNIA WAS IT WITHIN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED- THEN WE HAD THE GOVERNOR I CAN STAND ON THE CRACKED BED. OF LAKE MENDOCINO TALKING ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE WITHIN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED TWITTER CURTAILMENT ORDERON THE KLAMATH BSIN LAST YEAR BUT IN PARTICULAR. ON THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED- IT IS A UNIQUE AND VULNERABLE WATERSHED AND IT ALSO IS THE DRINKING WATER SOURCE TWO MAIN DRINKING WATER SOURCE TO OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLKS IN. COUNTLESS ADD USERS- IN IT IS THE BASIN OF LIFE FOR THE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR. WINE INDUSTRY WHICH WE ARE SO PROUD OF AND I'M I'M TRYING TO GET A UNDERSTANDING ON. WHY WERE ONLY FOCUS ON THE BAY DELTA AND NOT RESILIENCY WITHIN THE RUSSIAN RIVER SINCE WE KNOW IT'S ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE. MISTER CHAIR OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER- SENATOR IT HAS BEEN AS YOU SAID VERY CHALLENGING- IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED INCREDIBLE A CATASTROPHIC CONDITIONS FACING THE COMMUNITIES AS WE EXPAND AND ENACTED WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE BEAR IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED HAD A RESPONSE RATE FROM WATER. OF DIVERT HERS THAT'S ABOUT 92% SO- THAT TRUST THAT THAT WORK IS DONE BY LEADERS SUCH AS YOURSELF AND SO JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THE SUMMER THERE- AND KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW THIS IS HERE- AT THE REQUEST ABOUT THE MIDDLE TOOK PLAN AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO COMPLETE IT- IT IS IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE ALSO. HAVING CRITICAL INVESTMENTS IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED BOTH THROUGH OUR WORK AROUND WATER RIGHTS BUT ALSO DRINKING WATER OR THEIR- PART DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER AND DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND WHAT TO A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES AND HELP FIND- I'VE EITHER PROGRAMS OR PROJECTS OR OR HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS FOR FUNDING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND SO- YOU KNOW. IT AND I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW I'M NOT UNLIKE A POINTS WE MADE EARLIER THAT THIS IS SHOULD REALLY BE SEEN AS PART OF THE YOU KNOW THREE OVER THREE PACKAGE THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR AND THAT THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT I SAT IN OF THE BOARD IS ENGAGED IN AND THAT CAN BE- WATER SET HAVE BEEN FUNDED AND SO- I TAKE YOUR POINT I SEE HOW YOU KNOW AMONGST ALL THE POSSIBLE REQUESTED WE COULD BE HAVING WHY JUST BE DELTA HERE IN THIS MOMENT. BUT YOU KNOW IT IT IT IT DOESN'T HERE BOB S. REFLECT WHAT ARE A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE EXPENSES LAST YEAR AND CONTINUE TO ADOPT PLAN EXPENDING AS TO YOUR POINT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT WHAT IS GOING TO BE FACING THE COMMUNITY THIS SUMMER HOW BEST WE PREPARE OUR RESOURCES AND YOUR SUPPORT THE LOCAL THE LOCAL DECISION MAKING IN RESPONSE TO.

AT- D. OF W. ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION- YOU KNOW THE PART THAT I MEAN I JUST HAVE QUESTIONS ON- IN TERMS OF WORKLOAD AND WHETHER WE'VE GOT SUFFICIENT RESOURCES HERE TO ACTUALLY GET- THIS PROGRAM ONLINE HAS TO DO WITH THE COLLABORATIVE SPIRIT THAT THIS BILL ANTICIPATED BETWEEN CDFW. AND CALTRANS DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION AS A WHOLE- WE KNOW THAT IF WE'RE GONNA BE INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE- OVER THE COMING YEARS- THAT. THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE INEVITABLE IMPACTS ON HABITAT CONNECTIVITY ON A WILDLIFE.
