00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:24.949
I'M QUITE FAMILIAR WITH --

00:41:25.015 --> 00:41:27.518
HISTORIC HOMES IN COMMUNITIES

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:30.421
WHERE -- PEOPLE WERE BASICALLY

00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:32.456
ABLE TO BUY THOSE HOMES IN THE

00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:35.593
SEVENTIES EIGHTIES NINETIES NOW

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.328
THE FINANCIAL SITUATION IN OUR

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:40.731
OF THE ABILITY TO OWN HOMES.

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:43.834

IN THE EARLY YEARS.

00:41:49.139 --> 00:41:50.841
THOSE HOMES ARE BE INTEGRATED

00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:52.076
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:53.344
ABILITY SO I TRIED TO PUT

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.346

00:41:55.412 --> 00:41:57.615
THE ABILITY. FOR INDIVIDUALS TO

ACCESS THESE RESOURCES -- FOR

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:02.353
INDIVIDUAL HOMES BUT I WANTED

00:42:02.419 --> 00:42:03.921
THEM STILL TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:05.422
I CAN SEND YOU A PICTURE

00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:07.524

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:08.259
DON'T WORRY I WILL DO IT

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:09.793
PERSONALLY BUT I DON'T WANT TO

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.995
EMBARRASS THE HOMEOWNER IN A

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:12.763
HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR MY

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:13.564
HOUSE.

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:15.532
WHERE THIS INCREDIBLE HOME AND I

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.868
HAPPEN TO KNOW -- THE INDIVIDUAL

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:20.871
IS INCOME STRAPPED BUT THEY

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.006
DIDN'T -- SELL THEIR HOME.

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:24.074
AND SO I WANT TO BE PRESERVING

00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:26.644

THERE'S RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.386
THIS COMMITTEE OR ANY WOULD HAVE

00:42:35.452 --> 00:42:36.754
UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IS MY

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.757
INTENT -- AS OPPOSED TO TRYING

00:42:39.823 --> 00:42:41.992

MIGHT THINK HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:45.930

00:42:45.996 --> 00:42:47.698
LIMITED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE

00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:49.066

ASSESS IT.

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:51.902
GOING FORWARD BUT THAT WAS MY

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:53.537
RATIONALE.

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:56.006
RIGHT AND THEN -- SINCE HOUSING

00:42:56.073 --> 00:43:00.544
IS OUR BIG PROBLEM SHOULD

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:01.578
HOUSING PROJECTS HAVE PRIORITY

00:43:01.645 --> 00:43:02.413
OVER OTHER PROJECTS WHEN YOU'VE

00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:06.183
LIMITED TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS --

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.552
POSSIBLY I MEAN I'M OPEN TO

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:10.988
DISCUSSION BUT MY WITNESS HERE

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:12.756
MENTIONED FOR EXAMPLE THE FERRY

00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:15.125
BUILDING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:15.726
WOULD SAY IF YOU LOOK AT THAT

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:16.527
BUILDING.

00:43:16.593 --> 00:43:19.029
ON THE INTENT THERE WAS ALSO TO

00:43:19.096 --> 00:43:20.698
DRIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:22.666
IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GO IN YOU

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:23.667
WILL SEE THAT MOST OF THE

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:25.536
BUSINESSES THAT OCCUPY THE FERRY

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:25.970

OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES.

00:43:28.672 --> 00:43:31.442

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:33.143
ON THE CERTAINLY THE PROJECT

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:35.779
CLEARLY I ALWAYS BELIEVE HOUSING.

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:37.047
I WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:39.083

SAN DIEGO I AM OPEN TO THAT

FUNDING TO THE LOCAL CORES THAT

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:04.461
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REMOVE THESE

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:05.529
TWO BARRIERS.

00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:07.130
ONE RELATING TO EDUCATION

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:08.465
TYPICALLY A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WE

00:51:08.532 --> 00:51:09.733
WORK WITH OR DROP OUT OF HIGH

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.700
SCHOOL.

00:51:10.767 --> 00:51:13.537
A ONE OF OUR GOALS IS TO GIVE

00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:14.704
THEM A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION.

00:51:14.771 --> 00:51:15.539
TWO THEY TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE A

00:51:15.605 --> 00:51:17.307
LOT OF JOB EXPERIENCE AND SO

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:18.408
WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO IS

00:51:18.475 --> 00:51:19.176
ACTUALLY GIVEN THAT JOB

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:20.377
EXPERIENCE BY GETTING THEM OUT

00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:22.279
ON PROJECTS AND SOON AND THAT WE

00:51:22.345 --> 00:51:23.480
WERE ABLE TO GIVE THEM BOTH THE

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:24.514
JOB EXPERIENCE.

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:26.783
AND THE EDUCATION THEY NEED TO

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:29.119
BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY.

00:51:29.186 --> 00:51:30.187
HOWEVER WE HAVE INCREASINGLY

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:31.755
SEEN A PROBLEM WITH SOME OF OUR

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:34.624
CORE MEMBERS WHO -- WERE WITHIN

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:36.593
THE PAROLE SYSTEM AND BASICALLY

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.627
WHAT THAT MEANS IS WHEN THEY

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:40.096
LEAVE CARS -- PROGRAM AND THEY

00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:42.532
GO TO A PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:44.868
THEY'RE FINDING THAT THAT IS AN

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:45.769
ADDITIONAL BARRIER.

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:46.570
THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE GONE

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:48.438
THROUGH OUR PROGRAM THEY'RE NOT

00:51:48.505 --> 00:51:50.073
ABLE TO GET THAT KIND OF JOB.

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.141
IT IS THEREFORE TODAY WE

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:52.642
APPRECIATE THE THE CENTER HUESO

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:54.744
IS LEADERSHIP ON THIS MEASURE

00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:55.946
WHICH WE THINK WILL GO A LONG

00:51:56.012 --> 00:51:56.446
WAY.

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:57.347
AND REMOVING THAT BARRIER IN

00:51:57.414 --> 00:51:59.416
CREATING AN INCENTIVE FOR SOME

00:51:59.483 --> 00:51:59.983
THE FOLKS WHO COME TO OUR

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.787
PROGRAM TO GET A JOB AND BE

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:05.355
GAINFULLY EMPLOYED THANK YOU.

00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:05.989
THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:07.891
IN SUPPORT.

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:10.060
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:12.462
CNN COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:14.664
THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR QUIRK.

00:52:14.731 --> 00:52:16.967
SO WE HAVE SOME AREAS OF THE

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:19.503
STATE OUR PENINSULA THERE'S A 3%

00:52:19.569 --> 00:52:21.905
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THE EAST BAY

00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:24.741
IT'S AROUND -- FOUR FIVE WHERE

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:27.110
IN YOUR AREA HOWEVER IT'S

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:28.712
PROBABLY AROUND 20%.

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:30.280
I WOULD THINK THAT THIS TAX

00:52:30.347 --> 00:52:31.147
CREDIT.

00:52:31.214 --> 00:52:33.750
MIGHT MAKE SENSE WELL THE

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:34.985
QUESTION IS ARE YOU CREATING

00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:36.920
JOBS AND TO THE EXTENT YOUR

00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:40.891
GRADING THEM DO THEY GO -- TO

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:42.893
THE PEOPLE YOU'RE TRYING -- TO

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:46.630
TO REACH -- AND I JUST THINK

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:47.864
THAT YOUR AREA OF THE STATE

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:50.333
NEEDS A LOT MORE THAN MY AREA OF

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.235
THE STATE BUT THERE'S YOU KNOW I

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:53.770
I ONE THING YOU MIGHT THINK

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:55.572
ABOUT IS DOES IT MAKES MORE

00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:59.042
SENSE TO DO THIS IN AN AREA.

00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:00.443
I WOULD BE WORRIED THAT.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.380
FRANKLY IN MY AREA WHERE THERE

00:53:03.446 --> 00:53:04.514
ARE ALREADY PEOPLE.

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:06.383
DESPERATE TO HIRE.

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:08.552
AND THE BUILDING TRADES ARE

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:09.853
ABSOLUTELY TRYING TO GET

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.987
EVERYONE THEY CAN AND THEY'RE

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:13.690
WILLING TO TAKE PEOPLE WHO HAVE --

00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:15.325
FELONIES ON THEIR RECORD AND IN

00:53:15.392 --> 00:53:18.228
FACT -- I KNOW SOME PEOPLE IN

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:19.629
THE CARPENTERS WHO.

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:21.231
WHO BASICALLY HAD THEIR WHITE

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:22.432
LIGHTS?

00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:23.934
LIVES TURNED AROUND.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.235
I WOULD THINK THAT THIS IS

00:53:25.302 --> 00:53:26.903
APPROPRIATE IN SOME AREAS OF THE

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:29.539
STATE BUT PROBABLY NOT IN MY

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:31.241
HOME TOWN AWAY.

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:33.376
THE AREA I REPRESENT.

00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:36.012
AND A COMMON WELL I APPRECIATE

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:38.715
THAT VERY MUCH AND REGARDLESS OF

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:42.786
WHERE THESE INDIVIDUALS LIVE THE

00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:48.124
STATISTIC IS PRETTY -- EQUAL

00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:49.659
ACROSS THE STATE THAT THESE

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:52.329
YOUNG PEOPLE TEND TO RECIDIVISM.

00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:54.965
AT ABOUT AT A RATE OF ABOUT 70%

00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:56.900
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE IN

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:58.168
THE STATE SO.

00:53:58.234 --> 00:54:00.236
YEAH BUT WOULD IT.

00:54:00.303 --> 00:54:01.438
WOULD THIS EFFECT THAT

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:04.174
RECIDIVISM RATE IN A PLACE WHERE

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.376
I CAN ASSURE YOU WHENEVER I GO

00:54:06.443 --> 00:54:08.812
TO A SMALL BUSINESS IN MY AREA.

00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:10.413
THEY'RE ALWAYS SAYING LOOK WHAT

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.281
WE WANT.

00:54:11.348 --> 00:54:12.882
IS SOMEONE WHO WILL COME IN ON

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:14.517
TIME AND DO WHAT THEY'RE TOLD

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:15.986
IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT WE WANT

00:54:16.052 --> 00:54:19.623
PEOPLE AT THIS VERY BASIC LEVEL.

00:54:19.689 --> 00:54:21.625
AND THEY SAY THEY ARE WILLING TO

00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:23.994
TAKE ON PEOPLE LIKE THIS SO.

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.996
OUR OUR BILL IS A PILOT.

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:27.263
WE WANT WHAT WE IT'S A PILOT

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:30.500
PROGRAM IT HELLO OKAY DATE.

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:32.369
SO IT'S NOT REYES THE PILOT

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:34.504
GOING TO TAKE PLACE -- STATE

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:35.271
WIDE [inaudible]

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:40.110
SO. TWO YEARS SUNSET YEAH.

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:41.611
ARM WILL YOU BE COLLECTING THE

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:44.347
DATA WE NEED TO SEE WHERE IT'S

00:54:44.414 --> 00:54:46.349
EFFECTIVE IN WHERE IT ISN'T.

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.184
I GUESS THAT'S ONE OF ASIAN AND

00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:49.653
ASIAN SALEABLE TO US BUT AT THE

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:51.821
BILL DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE

00:54:51.888 --> 00:54:53.056
THAT REQUIREMENT TO COLLECT.

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:57.160
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU LOOK AT

00:54:57.227 --> 00:54:58.428
GETTING THE DATA TO SEE.

00:54:58.495 --> 00:54:59.462
AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY IT'S

00:54:59.529 --> 00:55:00.697
EASY FOR ME TO SAY THIS IS

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:02.632
HARDER TO PUT IT INTO ACTUAL

00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:03.867
LANGUAGE.

00:55:03.933 --> 00:55:06.002
BUT IF YOU -- IF THIS BILL DOES

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:07.504
GO FORWARD I THINK IT'S VERY

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.372
IMPORTANT TO SEE WHERE IT'S

00:55:09.439 --> 00:55:11.307
USEFUL AND WHERE IT ISN'T AND I

00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:13.209
SUSPECT THAT THERE ARE PLACES IN

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:14.544
THE STATE.

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:16.112
WHERE IT'LL BE MUCH MORE

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:18.114
EFFECTIVE THAN IN OTHER PLACES

00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:20.350
IN PARTICULAR I THINK MORE IN

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:21.851
YOUR DISTRICT THAN MINE?

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:25.321
BECAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE JUST

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:26.723
LOOKING FOR AND WHERE I AM

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:27.824
PARTICULARLY IN THE BUILDING

00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:31.127
TRADES JUST LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:32.629
TO TO FILL THESE POSITIONS AND

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:34.397
THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE PEOPLE

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:36.800
AND AND HAVE TAKEN PEOPLE WHO DO

00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:37.667
HAVE RECORDS.

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:47.143
MEASURING EFFICACY OF THE PILOT

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.912

DETERMINE?

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:51.648
IF IT'S EFFECTIVE AND IF WE'RE

00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:56.186
GONNA ROLL IT OUT.

00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:52.776
THAT HAVE TAKEN IT UP FOR THE

00:56:52.842 --> 00:56:54.210
NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:55.612
TAKEN IT UP BATES.

00:56:55.678 --> 00:56:57.614
ACTUAL DATA ON IT RICK

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.315
RECIDIVISM.

00:56:59.382 --> 00:57:03.019
AND AS HIRING RATES COMPARED TO

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:05.054
BASELINE SO FOR US THAT DB DATA

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:10.093
WOULD QUALIFY FOR SECTION.

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:10.760
FORTY ONE SUGGEST THE NUMBER OF

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:12.061
PEOPLE THAT TAKEN IT UP WOULD

00:57:12.128 --> 00:57:12.996
QUALIFY AS A MEASUREMENT OKAY.

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:14.297
YEAH I WOULD.

00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:15.165
I KNOW YOU PI LIKE MORE DETAILS

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:16.566
WHICH WOULD BE FANTASTIC I THINK

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:18.902
BUT AND AND NOT SOMETHING THE

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.937
AUTHOR CAN CONSIDER AND IS OF I

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:22.305
THINK A QUALIFIED COMMENT.

00:57:22.372 --> 00:57:24.140
HOWEVER I WILL TELL YOU THAT AS

00:57:24.207 --> 00:57:26.075
SOMEBODY YES THE CARPENTERS DO

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:28.244
REGULARLY WANT TO AYE HI ARE

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:30.814
OPEN. TO HIRING THOSE WHO HAVE

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.748
BEEN INCARCERATED HOWEVER THERE

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:32.549
ARE.

00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:34.484
A PLETHORA OF OTHER INDUSTRIES

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:35.819
THAT DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THOSE

00:57:35.885 --> 00:57:37.220
PROGRAMS AND ANYTHING THAT WE

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.621
CAN DO TO MAKE SURE.

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:39.756
THAT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO

00:57:39.823 --> 00:57:41.391
HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME AND NOW A

00:57:41.457 --> 00:57:42.325
LOT OF WHICH YOU HAVE SOFT

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:44.761
SKILLS WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THE

00:57:44.828 --> 00:57:47.497
BUDGET -- WORD -- GIVING MONEY

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:48.598
TO IS A PROGRAM CALLED THE

00:57:48.665 --> 00:57:49.732
CHALLENGER PROGRAM WHICH IS

00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:51.201
ACTUALLY TO DO SOMETHING JUST

00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:52.402
LIKE THIS IT'S TO TAKE KIDS WHO

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:53.670
ARE COMING OUT OF JUVENILE

00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:55.338
FACILITIES AND MAKE SURE.

00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:56.539
THAT THEY HAVE TRAINING WHILE

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:57.974
THEY'RE THERE SO THAT THEY GO

00:57:58.041 --> 00:57:59.742
STRAIGHT INTO A JOB BUT FOR

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.177
THOSE KIDS WHO ARE NOT PART OF

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:02.378
THAT THREE HUNDRED BED PILOT

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:03.379
PROGRAM.

00:58:03.446 --> 00:58:04.814
THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF YOUNG

00:58:04.881 --> 00:58:07.150
PEOPLE WHO DON'T WHO ARE GOING

00:58:07.217 --> 00:58:08.318
TO BE CARPENTERS WHO ARE WILLING

00:58:08.384 --> 00:58:10.153
PART PART OF THAT ARE PART OF

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:11.721
PIPEFITTERS OR SOME OF THE OTHER

00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:12.789
PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO TAKE

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:14.657
FOLKS THAT ARE THAT HAVE BEEN

00:58:14.724 --> 00:58:15.725
INCARCERATED.

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:17.627
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:19.195
A NEW PATH.

00:58:19.262 --> 00:58:20.730
AND THE PATH TO RECIDIVISM IS

00:58:20.797 --> 00:58:22.065
NOT JUST A PATH OF TRAINING

00:58:22.131 --> 00:58:23.867
INSIDE THE PRISONS BUT IT IS

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:28.137
ALSO A PATH TO WHERE THE YOU GO

00:58:28.204 --> 00:58:30.540
AFTERWARDS.

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:31.908
YET NO LIKE I NEVER SAY HEAR YOU

00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:32.675
ON THAT I THINK.

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:33.476
WHAT I WOULD CHALLENGE AND AND

00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:34.244
NOT JUST YOU I THINK FOR ALL OF

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:34.811
US RIGHT THE WE NEVER HAVE

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:36.045
ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO ALL THE

00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:37.947
THINGS THAT WE WANT TO DO SO?

00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:39.682
IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO DO

00:58:39.749 --> 00:58:41.184
WHATEVER WE CAN TO MEASURE IT SO

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:42.385
THAT WE CAN SAY.

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:43.486
YOU KNOW IS THIS PILOT PROGRAM

00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:44.420
THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO SPEND

00:58:44.487 --> 00:58:46.122
THESE DOLLARS OR IS THERE

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:48.591
NOTICES CHALLENGER PROGRAM A

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:49.192
MORE EFFECTIVELY DOUBLE AND I

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:50.560
THINK I WOULD EVEN JUST THE MOST

00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:52.295
MINIMAL DATA FROM FTP SAYING

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:54.597
THAT THIS MANY COMPANIES TOOK IN.

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:57.967
A HIRED YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE

00:58:58.034 --> 00:58:59.469
HAVE BEEN THROUGH REHABILITATION

00:58:59.535 --> 00:59:00.136
WILL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A MEASURE

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:01.838
OF HOW MANY PEOPLE VERSUS HOW

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:03.773
MANY DIDN'T LAST YEAR.

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.942
SO I THINK THAT'S A START YES IF

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:07.143
THEY WANT TO WORK WITH C. C. R.

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.311
AND SEE IF THAT THERE'S A WAY TO

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:09.112
COLLECT MORE DETAILED

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:10.647
INFORMATION OR PROBATION TO WORK

00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:12.448
ON MORE DETAILED INFORMATION I

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:12.815
THINK THAT IS.

00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:14.083
AS DOCTOR CLARK SAID A MUCH MORE

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:15.685
COMPLICATED PROCESS THERE'S

00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:17.520
PRIVACY ISSUES TRUST ME WE'VE

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:19.255
BEEN WORKING WITH THIS -- AND

00:59:19.322 --> 00:59:20.456
THEY'VE HAD REPORTS FROM

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:21.691
PROBATION DEPARTMENT OF THIS

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:23.426
YEAR TO TALK ABOUT THE KIND OF

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:24.027
THE CHALLENGES OF COLLECTING

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:24.827
THAT DATA.

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:26.963
BUT I THINK FROM FTV AT LEAST AS

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:29.032
A START TO KNOW IF FIVE

00:59:29.098 --> 00:59:30.767
COMPANIES USED IT UTILIZED IT OR

00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:32.235
A HUNDRED COMPANIES UTILIZED IT

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:33.636
WILL AT LEAST GIVE US AN IDEA

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:37.874
INTO YOUR SUPPORT GOING DOWN THE

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:39.075
RIGHT PATH.

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:39.742
AND THAT IS IN THEIR SECTION ONE

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:40.743
AMENDMENT THAT IS NOT IN THERE

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:42.178
NOW BUT THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.713
AN AND IF I CAN JUST -- YOU KNOW

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.715
NOW THAT I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO

00:59:45.782 --> 00:59:46.382
KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:48.418
YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST JUST TO GIVE

00:59:48.484 --> 00:59:50.286
YOU A LITTLE HISTORY OF WHERE WE

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:52.322
CAME UP WITH THIS BILL -- THIS

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:53.890
STATE USED TO HAVE AN ENTERPRISE

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:57.393
ZONE PROGRAM THAT -- WE LARGELY

00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:01.264
DISMANTLED IN TERMS OF HOW --

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.299
WHAT?

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:05.535
WHAT BUSINESSES ARE ENTITLED TO

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:08.304
A TAX CREDIT AND IN WHERE THAT

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:09.939
THAT IS CONDUCTED THAT WAS THERE

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:15.378
WAS A REFORM THAT HAPPEN AROUND --

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.081
TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THE

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:21.284
INFRASTRUCTURE -- IN TERMS OF

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:22.585
GATHERING GAS GATHERING DATA

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:23.886
THROUGH THAT PROGRAM STILL

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:25.054
EXISTS.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.255
THAT'S HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:28.124
ASSESS HOW MUCH OF THOSE TAX

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.859
DOLLARS ARE ACTUALLY BEING DRAWN.

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:32.395
AND AND USED IN UNDERSERVED

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.997
AREAS.

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.965
WE HAD ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:38.234
THAT THERE WOULD BE ABOUT SEVEN

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:38.801
HUNDRED THOUSAND DRAWN DOWN

01:00:38.868 --> 01:00:40.169
WHICH IS I MEAN THE NUMBER USED

01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:41.871
TO BE CLOSER TO NINE HUNDRED

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:44.107
MILLION -- WE THAT NUMBER WE

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:46.409
EXPECTED WILL GO DOWN TO ABOUT

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:47.010
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION IT HAS

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:48.211
ACTUALLY GONE DOWN TO ABOUT A

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:50.313
HUNDRED MILLION.

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.749
THOSE ARE MONIES THAT WERE

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:57.053
TENSION LEE -- INTENDED TO HELP

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.354
CREATE EMPLOYMENT HELP CREATE

01:00:58.421 --> 01:00:59.722
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:01.524
PEOPLE A LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND%

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.192
UNDERSERVED AREAS.

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:04.927
SO THIS PROGRAM WOULD SIMPLY --

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.562
WORKED INTO THE STRUCTURE OF

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:08.865
THAT ENTIRE ENTERPRISE.

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.700
ZONE -- PROGRAM THAT STILL

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:13.403
LARGELY INTACT SO WOULD ALLOW US

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:14.637
TO TRACK.

01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:16.472
WHAT'S BEING DRAWN DOWN WHERE

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:17.974
AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE.

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:20.043
SO -- ALL WE'RE DOING IS

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.511
BASICALLY ANSWERED IN THIS

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.780
POLICY AND TO THAT TAX CODE.

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:25.281
AND THAT -- FRAMEWORK THAT

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.383
ALREADY EXISTS AND HOPING THAT

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.752
WE GET WE GET SOME RESULTS THAT

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:31.988
THE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ARE DRAWN

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.489
THIS PROGRAM STAY OUT OF PRISON

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:34.490
GET A JOB.

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:38.261
AND ESTABLISH THAT HISTORY. TO

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:41.330
EVENTUALLY HELP THEM -- TO ONCE

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:44.233
THEY GET -- BEYOND A CERTAIN AGE

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.502
LIMIT. TO GO OFF ON THEIR OWN

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:49.072
ESTABLISH THAT WORK HISTORY SO I

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:50.606
THINK EVERYBODY EVERYTHING THAT

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.842
WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THIS

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:54.477
PROGRAM CAN BE.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.679
NOT ONLY MARKETED BUT UTILIZED

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.281
EMPLOYED AND AND TRACK IS

01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:00.583
ALREADY IN PLACE UNDER OUR OUR

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:01.417
STATES.

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:03.152
TAX CODE AND ADMINISTRATIVE

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:06.622
POLICIES -- WE JUST WANNA --

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:09.492
GIVE THIS A TRY I THINK -- THIS

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.294
BILL WOULD GIVE US.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.629
ENOUGH TIME TO PUT IT INTO A

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:16.232
FACT TO SEE IF IT IS UTILIZED

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:17.900
AND CONSIDER LOOK AT LATER DATE

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:19.669
TO SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL IT IS. TO

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:22.605
SEE IF WE WANT EMPLOY CONTINUE

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:23.940
TO PLAY IN THE FUTURE

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:24.240
[inaudible]

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:28.711
THANK YOU.

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:30.713
DOCTOR FORGET A QUESTION -- I'LL

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.281
BE VERY BRIEF.

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:33.282
I THINK WHAT WE BOTH WANT TO DO

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:34.217
IS SEE WHAT HAPPENED THE TWO

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:35.518
YEARS BEFORE.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.854
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO TWO YEARS

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.723
LATER AND IT'S NOT JUST -- THE

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:43.259
AMOUNT TAKEN UP IT'S WAS THERE

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:45.328
AN INCREASE ARE WE REALLY

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:46.796
SERVING MORE PEOPLE.

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:48.731
ARE WE JUST SEEING THAT THE

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:49.866
PLACES THAT ALREADY HAVE LOW

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:52.301
UNEMPLOYMENT ARE JUST USING IT A

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:54.070
LOT AND PLACES THAT.

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:55.538
DON'T DON'T USE IT.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:56.939
AND SO THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH OF

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:59.342
A CHANGE THAT'S THE MAIN THING I

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:01.177
THINK WE'RE BOTH CONCERNED ABOUT

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.612
WE WANT TO SEE CHANGE.

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:04.680
WHERE PARTICULARLY PLACES WITH

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.983
HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT SEE A A

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:08.117
MEASURE?

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:13.556
OF INCREASING JOBS.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:14.590
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:16.859
FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:17.560
AND I'D BE I'D BE.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:18.861
MORE THAN GLAD TO SUBMIT A

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:28.110
AN ADVISER AND THAT -- THE HI

01:07:28.177 --> 01:07:29.879
STATE TAXES WERE IMPOSED ON

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.547
THESE COMPASSION PROGRAMS WHICH

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:32.948
OF COURSE HAVE NO REVENUE

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:39.288
BECAUSE THEY DON'T SELL ANYTHING.

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:40.356

REVENUE TO PAY.

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:45.828
THE TAXES AND WHAT THIS DOES IS

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.097
IT REDUCES ACCESS -- BY VETERANS

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:49.799
AND PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AND

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:51.667
OTHER PEOPLE -- BECAUSE THEY

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:54.303
CAN'T AFFORD -- THAT OUGHT TO

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:57.406

THEY END UP GOING ON THE BLACK

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:00.209

TECHNICALLY -- A REDUCTION IN
