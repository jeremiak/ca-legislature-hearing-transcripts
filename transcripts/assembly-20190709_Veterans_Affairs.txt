A SUMMARY OF THE RELEVANT HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN STATE OF VETERANS COMMUNITY REPORT -- IN THIS REPORT IS THE FIRST OF THREE SUCH REPORTS FUNDED BY THE NHS AWAY SEE AND WILL SERVE AS A BENCHMARK FOR THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND PROVIDE A BASIS FOR WHICH WE CAN EVALUATE PROGRESS. I WILL ALSO REVIEW CABS IS VETERAN ACTION AGENDA. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND A REPORT -- AND AND TOUCH ON OUR TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT IN PROGRESS THERE AND THEN -- GIVE YOU AHEAD QUICK HEADS UP ON THE THAT ON VETERANS MENTAL HEALTH SUMMIT THAT'S UPCOMING IN AUGUST. SO THESE ARE THE MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES A CONSORTIUM OF SEVEN NONPROFIT VETERANS SERVICE PROVIDERS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS VETERANS. CABS IS JUROR GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY -- FACILITATES THE DELIVERY OF DIRECT SERVICES IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. STRETCHING FROM EUREKA TO SAN DIEGO. AND UNIT US VETS IN AND LOS ANGELES AREA VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. VETERANS VILLAGE SAN DIEGO OF COURSE AND AND SAN DIEGO -- US OF A VETERANS US. CALIFORNIA VETERANS FOUNDATION A DOWN AND IN CENTRAL VALLEY -- AND SOURCED POSH SHARES VETERANS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION -- OUR MISSION STATEMENT FOCUSES ON EMPLOYMENT TRAINING EDUCATION. HOUSING AND MEDICAL NEEDS FOR CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. NOW ALL TURN VERY BRIEFLY TO DISCUSSING SOME OF THE MORE PROFOUND FINDINGS IN THE REPORT THAT WE DID IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIRST OF ALL -- MENTAL HEALTH AND AND HOMELESSNESS ARE CLOSELY LINKED. AND WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO RECEIVE A THREE A THREE YEAR GRANT FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVER SECOND ABILITY COMMISSION. PART OF THAT GRAND INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT THAT WE PRODUCE THREE ANNUAL REPORTS. THE IMAGE HAS ALWAYS SEE IS MADE OF VETERANS A PRIORITY POPULATIONS OF THESE REPORTS WILL DOCUMENT THE STATUS OF VETERANS. MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS QUITE A MESSY SLIDE BUT ALL SUMMER IS SUMMER AS IT BRIEFLY FOR YOU MY APOLOGIES -- BUT IT DOES A CLEARLY HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT VETERANS POPULATION ACROSS OUR STATE AND MANY OF WHOM ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE COUNTIES OF ALAMEDA. SACRAMENTO SANTA CLARA. SAN BERNARDINO RIVERSIDE SAN DIEGO ORANGE OF COURSE LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHICH HOUSES MOST OR CHEN AND FORTY HOUSES MOST OF OUR HOMELESS VETERANS. ARE VETERAN POPULATION IS AGING -- OVER 70% ARE OVER [inaudible] FIFTY PREDOMINANTLY CAUCASIAN -- OVER 90% MALE AND DOMINATED BY VIETNAM ERA VETERANS ABOUT 40% OF THE POPULATION IS STILL VIETNAM VETERANS. AND THIS AGING DISTRIBUTION CHARGES JUST -- IS SYMBOLIC IN IN IN ONE WAY AND THAT IS IT IT. DISTINGUISHES A GROWTH IN AGING OF OUR VETERAN POPULATION IN THE NEXT DECADE THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IMPLYING OF COURSE THE NEED FOR SENIOR CARE AND THE COST IMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POPULATION WAS SIGNIFICANT HEALTH ISSUES. THIS IS A REPORT CARD TO PICK NEXT TWO SLIDES COVER REPORT CARD AND BASED ON OUR RESEARCH -- WE PREPARED THE SCORECARD TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC AREAS OF CONCERN. OUR FINDINGS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING CALIFORNIA'S SPECIFIC AREAS OF CONCERN. ELEVEN THOUSAND FOREIGN SEVENTY TWO VETERANS ARE HOMELESS. OF THAT 29% ARE HOMELESS YEAH OF OUR 20% OF OUR HOMELESS US VETERANS WITH 667% OF THOSE 60% AND PERCENT OF OUR VETERANS ON SHELTERED. CALIFORNIA'S VETERAN SUICIDE RATE IS TWENTY NINE PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION. SLIGHTLY UNDER THE NATIONAL RATE. BUT TWICE THE RATE PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND OUR GENERAL POPULATION. SADLY AS WE LOOK AT ANY IN FOR ANY REAL DATE DATA ON OPIATE OVER TO THOSE IN VETERAN INCARCERATION WE REALLY WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND ANY SOLID CALIFORNIA'S SPECIFIC INFORMATION THERE IS SOME NATIONAL DATA UP THERE -- THE AND THAT IS AN ITEM THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT MORE CLOSELY -- WHEN WE DO A REPORTED? TWENTY NINETEEN SEVENTY WILL LACK AGAIN ANYMORE DATA BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE COLLECTING THAT I'M SURE IN THIS NEXT -- NEXT CYCLE. GET A CHALLENGE SUBSTANTIATED BY THEIR SUPPORT INCLUDE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA'S HAD A A LARGE INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS AND SHELTERED VETERANS. AND WOMEN AND AND WOMEN VETERANS CONSTITUTE A GROWING NUMBER OF HOMELESS VETERANS. ARE SUICIDE RATES FOR VETERANS ARE STILL VERY HIGH AND JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT WITH VETERANS WHILE WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC DATA. IS IS IN OUR WORK WITH THE WITH THE COURTS IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN OUR COURT SYSTEM. OTHER KEY CHALLENGES CALIFORNIA LACKS A DEDICATED INADEQUATE FUNDING STREAM FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR VETERANS OLDER VETERANS. REPRESENT 50% OF HOMELESS VETERANS AND WILL INCREASE OVER THE COMING DECADE. AND THE COST OF CARE WILL INCREASE DRAMATICALLY DUE TO THIS POPULATIONS CHRONIC HEALTH CONCERNS. CONVERSELY A LACK OF TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. WAS SUPPORT SERVICES WILL IMPACT HER YOUNGER VETERANS AND WOMEN VETERANS IN NEED OF EARLY SUPPORT. SO WHAT IS OUR STATE ACTION PLANNER TELLS CABS AS ACTUAL PLAN FOR THE STATE FOR DRESSING THESE CHALLENGES. THAT ARE CONFRONTING OUR VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA. FIRST WILL ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN STATE AND FEDERAL HOUSING POLICY INITIATIVES SORRY [inaudible] SECONDLY. SUPPORT EXTENSION OF AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE VETERANS HOUSING AND HOMES FOR THE ENGINE PROGRAM -- THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ONE FOR YOUR BILL -- AND ALSO THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM -- WILL WORK TO IMPROVE THE VETERANS HOUSING HOMELESS PREVENTION PROGRAM GUIDELINES AND THE SAME WITH THOSE FOR THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME GUIDELINES -- INSURING THAT VETERANS -- AND AND AND VETERAN SPECIFIC SERVICES ARE INCLUDED IN THOSE PROGRAMS. OF FOLKS ON OLDER VETERANS WOMEN VETERANS POST NINE ELEVEN VETERANS AND FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AS PRIORITY POPULATIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES. AND FINALLY SEEK STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND OTHER SUPPORT OF SERVICES. TO BETTER SERVE OUR THE H. H. P. AND NO PLACE LIKE HOME HOUSING PROJECTS. OUR ORGANIZATIONAL PRIORITIES FOR TWENTY NINETEEN INCLUDE. BUILT ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT BENCHMARKS THAT WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED DISCUSSED REFINED VETERAN RELATED DATA. AND COMPLETELY YOU'RE TO REPORT BY THE END OF AUGUST. TWENTY NINETEEN AND CONDUCT OF VETERANS MENTAL HEALTH SOME OF THIS YEAR. SIDE OF FOURTEEN COVERS ARE OR WHAT WE HAVE PLANNED TO DO -- TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT AND WE ARE WELL ALONG IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT REPORT WHICH WILL BE DONE IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR -- IT'LL COVER THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF OUR VETERANS POPULATION GENERALLY -- VETERANS MENTAL HEALTH TRENDS SINCE THE TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT -- WHICH WILL GIVE US IN SOME WAYS AN EVALUATION OF HOW WELL WE ARE DOING AND WHEN YOUR TIME FRAME THAT WILL TELL US MUCH. BUT WE'LL DO IT AGAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY AND HOPEFULLY IT'LL GIVE US SOME SIGN. OF PROGRESS. UPDATE THE CAVS ACTION AGENDA AGAIN FOLLOWING -- THE REPORT WELL DONE IF I SPECIAL CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES -- WILL ALSO BE DOING A SIX COUNTY LOCAL PLAN REVIEW OF THEIR LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH PLAN TO SEE IF THEY ARE. A PROVIDING SERVICES INSIDE AND SERVICE DOLLARS FOR VETERANS LIKE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO. THE VETERAN SUMMIT WILL BE HOLDING ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH IN SACRAMENTO AND THE GOAL OF THE SUMMIT IS TO BRING TOGETHER. THE BRIGHTEST MINDS IN MENTAL HEALTH SUICIDE PREVENTION JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT IN VETERANS AGING. TO A FOSTER LEARNING INSPIRE HOPE AND PROMOTE ACTION IN HELPING. THE NUMEROUS VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA SUFFERING CATASTROPHIC AND EVEN FATAL REPERCUSSIONS FROM THEM. FOR THE MENTAL EMOTIONAL EFFECTS OF WAR AND MILITARY SERVICE. WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ENJOY IT AND AND AND AND JOIN US AT THE SUMMIT NEW ARE YOUR OFFICES WALL BE -- RECEIVING INVITATIONS. SO CLOSING -- THIS REPORT AND THE SUBSEQUENT TO REPORTS WILL CHALLENGE CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE ITS KEY ROLE. IN VETERAN DEVELOPMENT AND VETERAN DEPLOYMENT THE VETERAN DEPLOYMENT CYCLE BY COMPETENTLY AND COMPASSIONATELY RHYS. RECEIVING HOMER SERVICE MEMBERS AS A TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN LIFE. AS HOME TO THE LARGEST VETERANS POPULATION IN THE US CALIFORNIA. HAS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THE NATION WITH A DEMONSTRATION OF THE WILL AND THE ALLOCATION OF THE MEANS TO DO RIGHT BY OUR VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AS A CABS UP AS CALVES ARE PREPARES THE TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT AND WE GO THROUGH OUR SUMMIT. WE DO ALSO DO SO WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND HIGH HOPES AN AND A DEEP APPRECIATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION FOR THEIR COMMITMENT. TO VETERANS AS A PRIORITY POPULATION WITH REGARD TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. I JUST WANTED -- TO YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT THERE IS A SIX COUNTY PLAN REVIEW YES WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE THE SIX COUNTIES -- I WISH. I WISH YOU HADN'T ASKED ME THAT OF YOU DON'T I SHOULD KNOW THAT IT IT HONESTLY ANSWER MAYBE WE WE ARE. WE'RE FOCUSING -- ORANGE COUNTY HAD IS ONE LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS ANOTHER -- I BELIEVE RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS A THIRD -- WERE DOING. CENTRAL VALLEY MONTEREY COUNTY. AND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- NAPA. AND THERE'S ONE OTHER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA JUST NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT BUT IN THE PLAN REVIEWS AND AND WE'VE DONE -- WE DON'T ACTUALLY THIS WILL BE OUR THIRD CYCLE OF CONDUCTING THESE REVIEWS AND IT'S NOT IT'S FOR SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE PLANS. AND SEEING A VETERANS OR EVEN MENTION IN THE PLANS BUT THEN DRIVING A LITTLE BIT DEEPER TO SEE IF THAT MENTIONING IS. IS ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS AND IN TERMS OF DOLLAR COMMITMENTS AND WE FOUND THAT WHILE VETERANS ARE SOMETIMES A MENTION IN THE REPORTS AND THEY'RE REQUIRED TO BE BY THE WAY -- THE THE PROGRAM COMMITMENT OF THE DOLLAR COMMITMENT SIMPLY AREN'T THERE ON THE LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT ANYWAY. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER THANK YOU SO. WHAT IS YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT DO THE STANDELLS FOR THE VETERAN HOMELESS VETERANS? ACTUALLY -- IT'S OF THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE OUR OUR VETERANS VILLAGE OF SAN DIEGO WAS ACTUALLY I THINK THE FIRST. AGENCY TO DO IS STAND DOWN -- IN CALIFORNIA AND SO WE'RE ACTIVELY INVOLVED THEY JUST HAD THEIR STAND ON A WE HAD A CABS A BOARD MEETING DOWN THERE JUST -- WHEN THEY HAD THE STAND DOWN ONE IS A TWO MONTHS AGO? SO WE'RE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WORD WHERE THEY'RE AT ALL THE STAND DOWNS AND ALL THE COUNTIES THAT WE SERVICE SO THAT WERE CONNECTING WITH VETERANS AND AND AND CONNECTING THEM TO SERVICES. YEAH AND THAT'S YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST CHANCE. TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION I KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE. CONSTRAINED IN SO I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR YOUR FURTHER SUPPORT IN IN ANY WAY YOU CAN TO MAKE SURE THESE HAPPEN. BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY ONCE A YEAR THAT THESE. HOMELESS VETERANS ARE GETTING THE SUPPORT. FROM THE COMMUNITY AND IN THIS KIND OF FASHION. NO ADDITIONAL FOOD CLOTHES DENTISTRY -- VETERANS COURT ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED AND AND WE NEED TO BE A MAKE SURE THAT.

FOR FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION AND TO THE VETERANS THAT ARE IN THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. I'M HERE TO REPRESENT -- SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY NINE WHICH WOULD ALLOW ACTIVE DUTY SERVICEMEMBERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR PLACE ON THE MEDI CAL HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE WAITING LIST. IF THEY MAINTAIN RESIDENCY IN CALIFORNIA WHILE ON DEPLOYMENT. EXISTING LAWS THAT WISHES VARIOUS SERVICES UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THAT AN ABLE INDIVIDUALS. WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE PLACED IN A LIVE IN FACILITY TO LIVE AT HOME AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AS A FAMILY? SB TWO EIGHTY NINE KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER WAS STILL PROVIDING THE CARE THAT THE SPECIAL NEEDS INDIVIDUALS REQUIRE. THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE SERVICE MEMBER. AS WE KNOW ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS CAN RECEIVE TRANSFER ORDERS AT ANY TIME. AND OFTENTIMES THESE ORDERS MOVE THEM. AND THEIR FAMILIES COMPLETELY OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY THIS MOVE HAPPENS AND THESE FAMILIES SOMETIMES LOSE THEIR POSITIONS ON THE WAITING LIST. OF THE CALVET SERVICES. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. AND SOMETIMES IT'S EVEN THE SPOUSE NOT JUST THE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. WHO PLANNED TO RETURN TO CALIFORNIA AFTER THEIR SERVICE IN A FULL FILLED IN THE RETURN FROM OUT OF STATE SERVICE TO COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA? THIS BILL IS STILL VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW THE ACTIVE DUTY SERVICEMEMBERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR ELIGIBILITY STATUS. OR THEIR PLACE ON THE MEDI CAL HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE WAITING LIST. UPON RECEIVING ORDERS TO TRANSFER OUT OF THE STATE IF THE ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES MAINTAIN THEIR RESIDENCY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY WILL REMAIN ELIGIBLE AND HOLD THEIR POSITION ON THE WAITING LIST AND THAT IS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE WHEN THEY LEAVE THEY LOSE THEIR PLACE TO COME BACK. THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. THIRTY FOUR STATES ALREADY PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION THESE MEASURES HAVE PROVEN TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE MILITARY FAMILIES. THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY SEVERAL BETTERS ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH. ADVOCATES.

THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT.

BUT IT CAME TO ME BECAUSE OF MY SERVICE -- AS LA COUNTY COMMISSIONER MILITARY BETTER TO FAIRS OVER THE YEARS AND THE NUMBER OF VETERANS THAT I'VE REPRESENTED AND SO WHEN THEY FOUND OUT I WAS THE CHAIR -- HERE IN THE SENATE SIDE THE CALL STARTED COMING IN AND THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT STUCK MY HEART IT I WAS LIKE YOU.

VOEPEL I BOERNER HORVATH BRO. I DALY. DALY AYE FRAZIER. FRAZIER AYE GLORIA. GLORIA AYE MATHIS. MATHIS I MURATSUCHI. PETRIE-NORRIS. THREE NORTH AYE SOLACE. SALAS AYE. EIGHT ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VENTURE ALL RIGHT AND NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR GLACIER. YEAHHE WILL BE PRESENTING SB SIX FOUR FOUR GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR. AFTERNOON EVERYONE LOW. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. ARE THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEFORE YOU WOULD PROVIDE RUN A RELIEF TO ACTIVE DUTY. SERVICE MEMBERS BASED IN CALIFORNIA. BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF THE SECURITY DEPOSIT SERVICE MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY TO TO MOVE INTO A RENTAL UNIT -- THE BILL WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT LANDLORDS FROM DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SERVICE MEMBERS FOR HAVING TO PAY LESS SECURITY DEPOSIT -- IN ADDITION SB TWO TWO TWO BY CENTER HILL AND FORCES THIS PROVISION. BY PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION IN THE RENTAL MARKET BASED ON VETERAN OR MILITARY STATUS. CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS CRISIS MAKES A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR SERVICE MEMBERS TO FOR THE UP FRONT COST. OF MOVING INTO A A RENTAL UNIT IN CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH SERVICE MEMBERS RECEIVE A BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING. FROM THE MILITARY IT'S OFTEN NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THE UP FRONT COSTS OF RUNNING IN CALIFORNIA AND WHILE SERVICE MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE A LARGER ALLOWANCE. DUE TO THE HIGHER COST OF LIVING WHICH I THINK WAS NOTED IN YOUR ANALYSIS. IT CAN TAKE MONTHS FOR THE ALLOWANCE INCREASE TO TAKE A FACT. WHEN SERVICE MEMBERS TRANSFER HERE FROM OTHER STATES? THIS FORCES SERVICEMEMBERS TO HAVE TO RESORT TO LOANS AND OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT TO PAY FOR THAT SECURITY DEPOSIT. AND THAT FIRST MONTH'S RENT THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. TO MAKE SURE OUR ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO AFFORD RENT -- ART THESE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO -- DO SO MUCH FOR OUR COUNTRY DESERVE OUR SUPPORT IN AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE WE CAN HELP THEM OUT WE HAVE A WONDERFUL. COLLECTION OF SUPPORT GROUPS -- BEHIND IT AND WITH ME IS -- SET THREE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN GI FORM OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S FROM THE ABOVE CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE COMMANDERS VETERANS COUNCIL OF THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR. AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS SET THREE BUT THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS REPRESENTING AMERICAN JACK FORM AND THAT CALIFORNIA'S TAKE MINUTES VETERANS COUNCIL ON THE VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA. ALL IN SUPPORT. I WANT TO START BY THANKING SENATOR GLAZER FOR BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP SERVICE MEMBERS. SB SIX FOUR FOUR WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SECURITY DEPOSIT SERVICE MEMBERS HAVE TO PAY FOR RENTAL UNITS BY ONE MONTH THE MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS I REPRESENT. BELIEVE THAT THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE OUR COUNTRY AND ARE BASED IN CALIFORNIA MERIT. YOUR HIGHEST CONSIDERATION FOR THE RENTAL RELIEF THE SB SIX SIX SIX FOUR FOUR PROVIDES. IS NOT EASY TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT STATE WITH A SHORT NOTICE BUT SERVICE MEMBERS TO IT. AND THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE ARMED FORCES MEANS. WHAT IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO AND THERE ARE IS THE STRESSFUL PROCESS OF FINDING HOUSING IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME? WHEN THEY'RE TOLD TO COME TO CALIFORNIA THIS PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED BY THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING? SERVICE MEMBERS MUST HAVE SOME KIND OF RELIEF I AM UNAWARE OF ANY OTHER PROFESSION. OR YOU DO NOT. RELOCATE. WHERE IF YOU DO NOT RELOCATE TO WHERE YOU ARE TOLD TO RELOCATE? TO YOU COULD LOSE YOUR JOB SB SIX FOUR FOUR IS A FAIR AND NECESSARY APPROACH TO MITIGATING AGAINST THE PROBLEM SERVICE MEMBERS FACE. WHEN THEY MOVED TO CALIFORNIA? THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE ALSO CODIFIES THE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT THAT SERVICE MEMBERS MUST FOLLOW WHICH PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT PROTECTION FOR LANDLORDS LOOKING TO RECOUP ANY LOSSES. AS MENTIONED BEFORE. IF FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT MET SERVICE MEMBERS CAN FACE A MYRIAD OF DISCIPLINE ACTIONS. THANK YOU AND I URGE AYE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER AT TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. ANY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS SINNERS WANNA BE CLEAR THIS IS FOR ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL ONLY. YES SIR OKAY AND AS YOUR WITNESS -- REMARKS UCMJ DOES HAVE VERY STRICT. ARTICLES FOR SOLDIERS. TO MESS UP THEIR HOUSING UNITS AND ENSURES THAT THEY WILL PAY IN FULL AND I I KNOW THERE'S SOME CONCERNS OUT THERE BY REALTORS AN APARTMENT ASSOCIATION -- SO I JUST WANT ON RECORD FOR PEOPLE TO REALIZE THAT UCMJ IS. NOT TOLERANT ALL WHEN THESE THINGS COME UP. AND BEING A SERGEANT FOR TEN YEARS I KNOW WE WERE NEVER TOLERATE -- FOR PEOPLE LASSEN UP ON THESE TYPES OF THINGS SO AS NOT SIR WE'RE WE'RE NOT RUNNING THESE OUT TO BE FRIED HOUSES FOR YOUNG SOLDIERS -- SO. A I JUST WANT THAT OUT THERE SO MAYBE THAT WILL EASE SOME OF THE CONCERNS -- BECAUSE IF THEY DO MASS UP THAN IT DOES ATTACH THEIR WAGES. FOR PAIN THESE THINGS OFF CELL. I THINK IT'S JUST WORTH BEING SAID THAT WAY NOBODY HAS ANY HICCUPS ON IT AND WITH THAT'LL SECOND YOUR BILL. FOR ALL RIGHT SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- AND I APPRECIATE THE THE NOTION BEHIND THE BILL -- I WAS A REPRESENTS SAN DIEGO. PERSONAL PASSIONS ON HOUSING ISSUES THIS IS A CONVERGENCE OF THINGS I CARE A LOT ABOUT. CAN THE SENATOR TALK ABOUT WHY. YOU DIDN'T WHAT WHY. I KNOW WHY WE'RE TARGETING THIS TICKET POPULATION AS MUCH OF THE TESTIMONY ABOUT THE UNIQUE NATURE IS A MILITARY SERVICE BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE CONCERNS THAT YOU REPRESENT IN THIS BILL ARE APPLICABLE TO MOST TENANTS IN CALIFORNIA. pCHOOSE TO GO DOWN A MORE EXPANSIVE ROAD -- YEP TAKE THE GIVEN THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE GETTING -- THROUGH THE CHAIR -- IT'S BECAUSE THE RAT FIRST LINE SENSITIVE TO ANY LANDLORDS AND I'M SENSITIVE THE REALTORS POSITION BUT BECAUSE THE UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS OF BEING AN ACTIVE DUTY SOLDIER AND UNITED STATES. I THINK THERE IS A REASONABLE REMEDY FOR ANY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MIGHT ARISE THAT IS UNIQUE TO A SERVICE MEMBER VERSUS OTHER -- MEMBERS OF THE POPULATION SELL IT IS BECAUSE I'M I'M SENSITIVE TO WHAT I DON'T WANT ANYONE MESSING UP THE UNIT NOT BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT. AND I THINK IN THE CASE OF SERVICE MEMBERS THERE IS REAL ACCOUNTABILITY THERE THAT ISN'T. APPLICABLE TO THE REST OF THE POPULATION AND THAT'S WHY IT'S DESERVING OF THAT. PRODUCTION ONE MONTH'S RENT. WHAT ANALYSIS IF ANY HAS BEEN DONE? THAT WOULD INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT THIS WOULD PUT SERVICE MEMBERS AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR NINETEEN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. RIGHT AND THAT THAT'S THE ISSUE OF DISCRIMINATION RIGHT AND SO -- AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY -- THAT THERE ARE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THAT TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION IT COULD GO ON BECAUSE THAT A SERVICE MEMBER SAYS I I AM AN ACTIVE SERVICE MEMBER AND I DESERVE A REDUCTION IT'S POSSIBLE BUT WE ARE PASSING LAWS. AND WE HAVE A REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE. TO HOLD THAT LANDLORD ACCOUNTABLE IF IT WERE TO HAPPEN BUT NO ONE CAN. SURE THAT -- IT WON'T OKAY WHEN SOMEONE SAYS I'M A STUDENT EVEN THOUGH WE PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST STUDENTS AND HOUSING. THEY COULD STILL MAKE A CHOICE AND SO. THAT THAT IS THAT THAT IS A POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF THIS LEGISLATION I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND IF I DID FIND IT TO BE A PROBLEM OUT THERE I'D COME BACK AND ASK THAT THE BILL BE REVERSED THAT REALLY WAS THE CONSEQUENCE I CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT. AIMING TO TO DO THAT FOR THAT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD BUT IT IS A POSSIBILITY OKAY IT IS -- I JUST I I OBSERVE THAT -- YOUR CITY IS REALLY HOT HOUSING MARKET THE VACANCY RATES EXTREMELY LOW I THINK SERVICE MEMBERS BY VIRTUE OF THEIR PROFESSION AND THE THE STRINGS THAT COME WITH THE PROFESSION IS THE MISSION BY YOU AND BY MY COLLEAGUE. MISTER MATHIS -- PLUS THE THE DH IS REALLY RELIABLE SOURCE OF INCOME -- IS PAID ON TIME THESE ARE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT THEY GET I WOULD WELL AS RISE READ THIS BILL LAST NIGHT I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT I DO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT CREATES. PERHAPS THE OPPOSITE INTENDED FACTS AND YOU JUST. GAVE TESTIMONY SAYING THAT YOU WOULD CHANGE IT IF IT CAME TO BE THAT THE STAFF THAT THIS WERE TO BECOME LAW WHO WERE FOUND TO BE ACTUALLY HARMFUL THAN HELPFUL TO VETERANS. FOR SERVICE MEMBERS. I THINK THAT WOULD BE -- FIRST UP ON IN LINE -- TO TO CHANGE IT THIS THIS BUT BILL BY THE WAY CAME TO ME FOR MY SERVICE MEMBER LEAD FROM MY I HAVE A I HAVE A GUY CAN'T PARK IS IN MY DISTRICT. AND IT WAS THE MILITARY LEADERS WHO CAME TO ME AND AND RAISE THIS ISSUE AS A PROBLEM THEY WERE HAVING IN MY DISTRICT WITH HOUSING. AND TRANSFER OF OF OF SERVICE MEMBERS TO THE AREA THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT THIS BILL TO MY ATTENTION WAS AND WAS IN A STAFF DRIVEN IDEA IT ACTUALLY CAME FROM MY FRIENDS IN THE MILITARY YOU ASKED ME. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM THEY'RE HAVING MY LAST OBSERVATION JUST GIVE IN I CAN RECOGNIZE THIS NOT THE LAST STOP LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR THIS BILL -- IS CREATING MORE THE RECORD IT'S IN THE BILL ANALYSIS OF OF THE NEED FOR IT -- IS IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF ON SOME OF MY BASIS AT LEAST THE ON BASE -- HOUSING IS NOT FULLY UTILIZED -- AND THAT AGAIN IS ON A BENEFITS AFFORDED TO EVERY TEN IT NO SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE. BUT WHEN CONSIDERING THE TO TALLY FOR HOUSING CRISIS YOU KNOW HELPING TO EXPLAIN WHY THAT PHENOMENON HAPPENS I RECOGNIZE FOR FAMILIES IT'S OFTEN NOT AN APPROPRIATE PLACE VERTICALLY FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. IT IS A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY -- BUT I WOULD IN FURTHERANCE OF THE BILL IN ACHIEVING THE POLICY AND YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE I THINK EXPLAINING WHY THAT VACANCY. RATE IS NOT THE S. NOT THE ANSWER OPTICALLY WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT TO SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES -- SADLY THE A SOME OF MY LOCAL CITIES I'M TO ALWAYS HAVE THE MOST POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MILITARY BECAUSE THE IMPACTS ON MINUTES AS I WAS READING THIS BILL LAST NIGHT WHILE I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL HI. I DON'T WANT TO BE CONFUSED OTHERWISE -- ANTICIPATING SOME OF THE PUSH BACK AND TRIED TO HELP CREATE THE LEGISLATIVE RECORD ABOUT WHY THIS IS NECESSARY AND WHY BETWEEN THE THE ALLOWANCE THAT IS PROVIDED OVER ABOVE THE SALARY. COUPLED WITH THE ON BASE HOUSING THAT'S IT'S A PRETTY LUCRATIVE BENEFITS ASSUMING THAT IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION -- AND GEOGRAPHICALLY APPROPRIATE -- THAT DID THIS BILL STILL UNNECESSARY AND YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMEONE WHO THINKS THE HOUSING CRISIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE FACING OUR CITY I HOPE THAT WE ARE OUR STATE -- SORRY DIFFERENT JOB RIGHT NOW -- THAT WE'D BE -- CONSIDERING AND THINKING ABOUT MORE WAYS THAT WE CAN SUPPORT TENANTS IN CALIFORNIA NOT JUST THOSE WHO SERVICE VIDAK DOT JUST SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS. A MR LARA RINGS OF REALLY GOOD POINT. AND I I'VE BEEN AND ACTUALLY SPENT TIME AT CAMP PARKS TO A GREAT LITTLE PLACE BUT CERTAIN. CAMPS LIKE CAMP PARKS IN CAMP ROBERTS AND SEVERAL OF OUR STATE. ACTIVE DUTY BASIS -- DON'T HAVE THE ON BASE HOUSING. WHICH IS WHY THIS IS AN ISSUE -- RIGHT. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO GIVE EASE. TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS MAY BE A PROVISION WITHIN YOUR BILL. THAT REQUIRES THEM TO SHOW A COPY OF THEIR ORDERS. THAT SHOWS THEY'RE ACTUALLY STATIONED THERE -- THAT WAY THEY HAVE PROOF -- BEING IN THE MILITARY YOU DO GET A SET OF ORDERS THAT SHOWS WHERE YOUR STATION -- WHERE TRANSFERRED -- TO THAT WAY THERE'S ACTUALLY PROOF OF THEM BEING BASED THERE -- THAT WOULD THERE'S SOME OTHER TYPE OF DOCUMENTATION THAT WAY. I MEAN. THEY I THINK THE CONCERN COMES UP AS IN ANY. VETERAN CAN HAVE A ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY CARD AND THEY COULD HAVE JUST BEEN KICKED OUT. AND AND GOTTEN A DD -- TWO FOURTEEN ENOUGH SOMETHING OTHER THAN HONORABLE. AND STILL HAVE A VETERAN ID CARD AND CAN SHOW UP AND THEN GO OH HEY I WANT RAN. AND GET IN USING THE S. WHICH SHOULD BE A CONCERN. BUT IF THEY HAVE A COPY OF THEIR ORDER SAYING HEY I JUST MOVED HERE I JUST GAS STATION HERE HERE'S A COPY MY ORDERS. THEN THAT'S SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHOWS THEM ON THE UP AND UP. WHICH IS A BETTER PROTECTION ALL THE WAY AROUND IT WOULD REDUCE ANY FRAUD CONCERNS. AT THROUGH THE CHAIR. WHAT YOU ARE THE GOAL THAT YOU IDENTIFY IS EXACTLY MICHAEL AND IT'S CERTAINLY IF THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT THAT TYPE OF AN ABUSE I WOULD NOT WANT AYE I'D WHAT I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND SEE IF I? WE CAN MAYBE. SURE IT'S NEAR A TO NOT UP TO TRY TO AVOID THAT ABUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT AND YEAH IN A MATTER. I THINK YOUR YOUR OBSERVATIONS A GOOD ONE AND LET ME GO TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT AND IF YOU'VE GOT ANY QUESTIONS I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU WITH. YEAH THANK YOU PROJECTS. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION ALRIGHT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST. TO EXTEND MY APPRECIATION TO THE THE THOUGHTFUL REMARKS IN THE REPRESENTED FROM SAN DIEGO. I EACH OF THESE BASES ARE A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES DIFFERENT TO SITUATIONS WITH ON BASE HOUSING AND SOME WITHOUT IN MY CASE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT -- AND I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENTS ABOUT HOW WE HAVE. BROADER HOUSING ISSUES HERE AN ANOMALY TAKEN A VERY SMALL LITTLE SLICE AND NOT REALLY MEANT TO TRY TO CREATE A DISADVANTAGE FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT JUST TO TRY TO PROTECT THEIR ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS TO HELP IN THIS TRANSITION THAT'S ALL AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIVE UP RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE HAVE A MOTION BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS.
