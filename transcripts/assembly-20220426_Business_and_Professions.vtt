ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY

01:34:57.825 --> 01:34:58.325
TWO NEW RETAILERS INTO THE

01:34:58.392 --> 01:35:01.395
MARKET ASCENTIAL EVERYDAY- I

01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:03.597
REALIZE THAT WE NEED MORE

01:35:03.664 --> 01:35:04.465
RETAIL- BUT THIS WAS NOT A

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:06.467
DILUTION OF EXISTING MARKETS

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:08.135
WHICH ALREADY HAVE RETAIL ACCESS

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:10.271
AND THEM IN THIS TO BE A GREAT

01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:11.972
BILL IS A GREAT EXPANSION OF

01:35:12.039 --> 01:35:13.274

OPPORTUNITY TO MARKET THEIR

01:35:15.142 --> 01:35:16.243
PRODUCTS WHICH I THINK IS VERY

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:17.978
NECESSARY. BUT THIS CURRENT

01:35:18.045 --> 01:35:19.680
DILUTION OF AN EXISTING MARKET

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:21.449
PUTS SOCIAL EQUITY GROUPS THAT

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:23.784
AT AND HARM'S WAY- AND ALSO PUTS

01:35:23.851 --> 01:35:25.586
A BIG BURDEN ON THE STATE THE

01:35:25.653 --> 01:35:29.123
DCC THE DCC TO- PROCESS OVER

01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:30.257
FOUR THOUSAND APPLICATIONS AND

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.126
THAT FOUR THOUSAND APPLICATIONS

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:34.595
EVERY TWELVE EVENTS WHAT IS THE

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:35.796
COST OF DEATH LAST TIME IN

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:37.398
APPROPRIATIONS WE GOT TO SOME

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:40.668
POINT WHERE THIS COST WAS GOING

01:35:40.734 --> 01:35:42.103
TO BE ALMOST IN SOME PAUL. AND

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:43.871
THE AMOUNT OF LICENSES WE NEED

01:35:43.938 --> 01:35:45.206
TO BRING ON TO ONLINE IN

01:35:45.272 --> 01:35:46.807
CALIFORNIA. THIS IS ALMOST A

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:48.809
DISTRACTION I REALIZE THIS IS

01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:50.678
NECESSARY I'VE BEEN IN NORTHERN

01:35:50.744 --> 01:35:51.779
CALIFORNIA GROWER FROM EIGHTEEN

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:53.747
YEARS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I'M

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:55.182
DISTANT FROM. BUT AS A SOUTHERN

01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:56.784
CALIFORNIA RETAILER I SEE THIS

01:35:56.851 --> 01:35:58.085
IS A DILUTION OF AN EXISTING

01:35:58.152 --> 01:35:59.787
MARKET WHERE WE HAVE ALMOST.

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:00.921
SEVEN HUNDRED RETAILERS IN THAT

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:02.957
MARKET AND WE DON'T NEED SEVEN

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:04.058
HUNDRED MORE TO ENTER THAT

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:06.861
MARKET ON ANY ONE DAY. SO THIS

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:08.062
IS THE POSITION WE HAVE ALSO

01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:09.163
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE

01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:10.397
CREATING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

CREATE BANDS. AND WE SEEN THIS

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:14.735
ALREADY IN LONG BEACH WHERE 75%

01:36:14.802 --> 01:36:16.470

FIT- SECOND- IT. IT DOESN'T JUST

02:31:16.233 --> 02:31:19.336
ATTACK ONE. GROUP OF PEOPLE LIKE

02:31:19.403 --> 02:31:21.338
THEY SAID IT WOULD ACT. IT ALSO

02:31:21.405 --> 02:31:22.907
DOES RESCUE GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE-

02:31:22.973 --> 02:31:25.543

BASED ON WHAT THEY SAY THEY'RE

02:40:02.392 --> 02:40:04.094
JUST IGNORING WHAT THEY SEE-

03:29:17.678 --> 03:29:19.380
IN THE COUNTRY. PURSUANT TO THAT

03:29:19.446 --> 03:29:21.081
POLICY THE CDMA STRONGLY

03:29:21.148 --> 03:29:22.116
DISCOURAGES OWNERS FROM DECLINE

03:29:22.182 --> 03:29:24.285
THEIR CATS AND THE CV MAY

03:29:24.351 --> 03:29:25.152
RECENTLY HOSTED TWO WELL

03:29:31.592 --> 03:29:33.060
SPECIFICALLY. I'M NOT PRO

03:29:33.127 --> 03:29:34.895
DECLINE I HAVE TWO INDOOR CATS

03:29:34.962 --> 03:29:37.097
WERE NOT DECLAWED. AND IN TWENTY

03:29:37.164 --> 03:29:38.065
EIGHTEEN THE DOCTORS IN MY

03:29:38.132 --> 03:29:39.300

HOSPITAL. THAT BEING SAID OUR

03:29:42.603 --> 03:29:44.004
CONCERN IS THAT THIS BILL IF

03:29:44.071 --> 03:29:45.439
SIGNED WOULD CREATE A PRECEDENT

03:29:45.506 --> 03:29:47.141
STATUE THAT DIRECTLY IMPACTS OUR

03:29:47.207 --> 03:29:48.475

VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS. AND

03:29:50.311 --> 03:29:52.947
WOULD DO SO IN A SITUATION WHERE

03:29:53.013 --> 03:29:53.580
THE PROFESSIONALS ALREADY SELF

03:29:53.647 --> 03:29:55.182
REGULATED MUCH OF THAT DECLINE.

03:29:55.249 --> 03:29:57.518
AS TO WHERE IT'S NOW RARELY.

03:29:57.584 --> 03:29:59.286
RARELY PERFORMED. IT IS

03:29:59.353 --> 03:30:00.421
CONCERNING TO THINK THAT AT ANY

03:30:00.487 --> 03:30:02.589
TIME AN OUTSIDE GROUP MAY HAVE

03:30:02.656 --> 03:30:03.691
AN AVERSION TO A SIGNIFICANT

03:30:03.757 --> 03:30:04.558
SURGICAL PROCEDURE TREATMENT.

03:30:04.625 --> 03:30:06.260
THAT GROUP WOULD BE ABLE TO

03:30:06.327 --> 03:30:07.428
MEMORIALIZE A BAN. OF THAT

03:30:07.494 --> 03:30:09.363
MEDICAL PROCEDURE INTO LAW AND

03:30:09.430 --> 03:30:10.664
TRULY THAT GOES FOR ANY HEALTH

03:30:10.731 --> 03:30:12.433
PROFESSION NOT JUST VETERINARY

03:30:12.499 --> 03:30:14.635

MAJORITY OF AT THE VETERINARY

PROFESSION IS TRENDING AWAY FROM

03:30:17.871 --> 03:30:19.640
THE SURGERY THEN WHY NOT JUST

03:30:19.707 --> 03:30:21.742
BAN IT. THEN WHAT WE DO AND THE

03:30:21.809 --> 03:30:22.443
VERY RARE INSTANCES WHERE WE

03:30:22.509 --> 03:30:24.044
HAVE A CLIENT WITH AN AUTISTIC

03:30:24.111 --> 03:30:25.713
CHILD IN THE HOUSE AND THE CAT

03:30:25.779 --> 03:30:27.247
IS SCRATCHING THAT CHILD. OR

03:30:27.314 --> 03:30:28.248
SENIOR CITIZEN WHO LIVES ALONE

03:30:28.315 --> 03:30:30.217

03:30:31.385 --> 03:30:32.353
TAKING COUMADIN OR CHEMOTHERAPY

03:30:32.419 --> 03:30:33.420

03:30:34.455 --> 03:30:36.323
RELINQUISH THEIR CATS THE CVM IS

03:30:36.390 --> 03:30:38.192
SHORT AND SIMPLE ANSWER IS NO.

03:30:38.258 --> 03:30:39.626
AND BOTH OF THE EXAMPLES I JUST

03:30:39.693 --> 03:30:41.161
GAVE THE CAT OWNERS WOULD SHOULD

IT'S BEST FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ARE

03:51:09.755 --> 03:51:11.224
BEST FOR THE ANIMAL AND WHAT I

03:51:11.290 --> 03:51:12.692
HEARD TODAY WAS CONTRADICTING

03:51:12.758 --> 03:51:14.227
TESTIMONY FROM THE OPPOSITION

03:51:14.293 --> 03:51:16.128

03:51:16.195 --> 03:51:18.097
MEDICAL BOARD HAS ACTUALLY NOT

03:51:18.164 --> 03:51:20.233
SUBMITTED AN OFFICIAL LETTER OF.

03:51:20.299 --> 03:51:22.335
OPPOSITION AND SO WE HAVE BEEN

03:51:22.401 --> 03:51:23.202
UNABLE TO ACTUALLY WORK WITH

OPPOSE SOMETHING WITHOUT HAVING

THOSE CONCERNS SO FIRST AND

03:51:46.158 --> 03:51:49.428
FOREMOST. DECLINE A CAT DOES NOT

03:51:49.495 --> 03:51:50.529
MEAN THAT THE CAT'S NOT GOING TO

03:51:50.596 --> 03:51:53.032
BITE AND SO IF THE CONCERN IS

03:51:53.099 --> 03:51:54.967
FOR AN AUTISTIC CHILD OR FOR A

03:51:55.034 --> 03:51:57.970
SENIOR CITIZEN THE REALITY MAY

03:51:58.037 --> 03:51:59.372
BE THAT HAVING A CAT MAY NOT BE

03:51:59.438 --> 03:52:01.607
THE ANSWER WHAT THAT INDIVIDUAL

03:52:01.674 --> 03:52:03.509
NEEDS AND THERE ARE OTHER

03:52:03.576 --> 03:52:04.310

NOT HAVING TO DECLAWED CAT

THAT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO THE

03:52:14.253 --> 03:52:16.722
HEALTH OF THE CAT OR THE ANIMAL

03:52:16.789 --> 03:52:17.723
ITSELF AND SO WHILE THIS BILL
