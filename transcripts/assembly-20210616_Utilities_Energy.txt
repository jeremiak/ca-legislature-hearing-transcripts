EIGHTEEN SKINNER- THIS IS HYDROGEN GREEN HYDROGEN EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AS ALWAYS WELCOME SENATOR SKINNER WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR PRESENTATION IT DOES ENJOY DO PASSES A MINUTE TO NATURAL RESOURCES YOU MAY BEGIN. THANKS SO MUCH TO YOUR HOME. IS A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILLS ARE SECOND. HAS BEEN SECONDED. SENATOR PLEASE PROCEED. ARM WELL IF THERE MAY BE. BUT ALSO THIS THE AND MICHAEL OFF JUST VERY THREE- THE BILL JUST ALLOWS US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. GREEN HYDROGEN STILL TO BE FULLY DEFINED NOT DEFINED IN THE BILL BUT- OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE GREAT AGENCIES AND GREAT MINDS THAT WILL HELP US DO SO. BUT IT ALLOWS US TO INCORPORATE SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP US BOTH DECARBONISE REDUCE POLLUTION. IN VERY EFFECTIVE WAYS IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MODES WHETHER IT'S ELECTRICITY STORAGE OR FEELING TRANSPORTATION HEAVY DUTY FOR EXAMPLE AND SUCH THINGS. AND SO- WITH THAT'LL JUST TURNED TO MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND THEN- IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM SO WE'LL START WITH JANICE LYNN WHO'S AT THE GREEN HYDROGEN COALITION FOLLOWED BY ANDREW. MEREDITH OF THE BUILDING. OKAY SO WE WILL TO A JENNIFER PLAN FOR. WITH A HIGH COALITION. HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. HELLO YES YOU CAN BE. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER THANK YOU CHAIR HOLDEN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S JANET FLANNER AND THE PHONE AND PRESIDENT THE GREEN HYDROGEN COALITION FOR A NEW FIVE A ONCE THREE NON. WHOSE MISSION IS TO ADVANCE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION AND USE APPS GAIL TO ACCELERATE MULTI SECTORAL DECARBONISATION- I'M GONNA KEEP MY COMMENTS VERY BRIEF TODAY BUT JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE REALIZED THAT DEFINING GREEN HAS IMPORTANT WERE WORKING WITH. TO IT TO COME TO TERMS A PROPER AGING GUIDE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE FOR SENATE BILLY AS THE SAN TRISTAN AN VISION AND LEGAL AND FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF GREEN HIGH TEACHER- THERE'S I WANT TO COVER TODAY WHY IT'S A GREAT WAY TO ALLOW. INDY CAR OUR SUPPLY WE CAN OUR FUN RENEWABLE RE. INTO A FLEX ZERO CARD FUEL THANK DISPLACING ANY OTHER FOSSILS LAP. INCREASING ENERGY REALIZED AND RESILIENCE SECONDLY WITH GREEN WE CAN READ VALUABLE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AFFORDABLE ENERGY TRANSIT. AS AN EXAM AND W. IS AN THE PROCESS OF CAN IT TO REMAINING COAL. LOCATED IN CENTRAL NEW TO A HUNDRED PER GREEN HYDROGEN COMBINES GAS TO. AND LYFT GREEN HIDE IS THE TREMENDOUS ACTION DEVELOP AND JOB CREATING EXPORT OUT FOR K. MANY COUNTRIES THE WORLD ARE BUYING TO BECOME LEADING HIGH COULD. INCLUDING AUSTRIA CHILE SPAIN AND ARABIA CAL SHOULD BE ONE OF THEM WITHOUT B. E. K. IS AT RISK OF FALLING GLOBALLY I RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR AYE THOSE ONCE BILL EIGHTEEN TO A CAL CAN GLOBAL LEADER. IN THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION THANK YOU. THANK OF CENTER BE WE MOVE ON TO YOUR NEXT. THERE WERE A THE WERE YES OF. THANK YOU- CHAIR APOLOGY THAT. I ALL OF THE MINUTES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR SAID. A WITNESS AND REMAIN WITH THE BUILDING AND CAN TRADE. STIR MERIT YOU CAN PERCEIVE YOUR TESTIMONY. GET OFF MR CHIU MEMBERS OF THE- ON THE OF THE NO MEMBERS OF THE CAL STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL I'M HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT SB EIGHTEEN. I FIRST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE IN PERSON TODAY WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE ALL DONE OVER THE LAST YEAR IN LIGHT OF COBIT. WITH THAT BEING SAID THE REASON THAT WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF GREEN HYDROGEN IS THIS IS TRULY AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSITION OURSELVES JUST LEAD TOWARDS A CLEAN AND RENEWABLE RESOURCE. AS YOU ALL KNOW IN THIS BUILDING THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES. WE HAVE BUILT OVER TO OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR ALONE THE EQUIVALENT OF TWELVE NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE GREEN HYDROGEN OFFERS ANOTHER FRONT HERE FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET ITS AMBITIOUS. CLIMATE GOALS. SIMP PUT WE CANNOT IGNORE WE CAN'T IGNORE TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS IF WE'RE GOING TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY IN CALIFORNIA. ALL AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE TO BE EXPLORED. THEY HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED. AND I WAS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID CALIFORNIA HAS A HISTORY OF DOING THAT WITH EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. AGAIN THAT COULD HELP US AWAY FROM THE GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS SECTOR THAT ALREADY EXIST. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF AGAIN A HALF MILLION MEMBERS SEVENTY THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE PRINT THIS IS. 70% OF WHOM ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR WE ASK FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE IN PERSON AS WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES WHO WILL BE PRESENTED AND OPPOSITION TESTIFIED BY PHONE. THAT IS JOHN SCHAEFER WITH HUMBLE THREE FIFTY .ORG. FOR MODERATOR IF YOU CAN ENSURE THE JOHN SCHAEFER IS ON THE LINE WE WILL RECEIVE HIS TESTIMONY NOW. I THINK I'M ON THE LINE. THEN WE HEAR YOU AND YOU CAN PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIR HOLDEN SENATOR SKINNER AND OTHER MEMBERS. THREE FIFTY DOT ORG BELIEVES SAID HYDROGEN HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO STORE ENERGY AND GET US OFF FOSSIL FUELS INTERESTED CLIMATE CRISIS BUT WE OPPOSE S. B. EIGHTEEN BECAUSE IN ITS PRESENT FORM IT DOESN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN AND ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN. IN A SEMANTIC SHELL GAME S. B. EIGHTEEN COULD ALLOW DIRTY ELECTRICITY TO BE USED TO MAKE SO CALLED CLEAN HYDROGEN. TO AVOID GREENWASHING ALL REFERENCES IN S. B. EIGHTEEN SHOULD SAY GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN. THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM TOO SB EIGHTEEN MODIFIES P. U. C. CODE SECTION FOUR HUNDRED POINT THREE WHICH IN TURN REFERENCES SECTION FOUR HUNDRED POINT TWO. NEW LANGUAGE SHOULD BE ADDED TO SECTION FOUR HUNDRED POINT TWO NAMELY THE PHRASE USING ELECTRICITY FROM WIND OR SOLAR SOURCES. THUS SECTION FOUR HUNDRED POINT TWO SHOULD READ FOR PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN MEANS HYDROGEN GAS PRODUCED THROUGH ELECTROLYSIS USING ELECTRICITY FROM WIND OR SOLAR SOURCES- AND DOES NOT INCLUDE. IN THE REST OF THE SECTION IS OKAY FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN SAY CAN TO KEEP CALIFORNIA ON TRACK TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE HOPE YOU'LL REJECT SB EIGHTEEN NOW AND THEN CONSIDER LEGISLATION THAT CORRECTS THESE SHORTCOMINGS. SO WHO AM I JOHN SHAPER RETIRED ENGINEER FORTY YEARS EXPERIENCE IN ENERGY AND A PHD FROM STANFORD THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- STEVEN ROSENBLOOM WITH THREE FIFTY SILICON VALLEY YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. YEAH MY NAME IS A DOCTOR STEVEN ROSENBLUM- THANK YOU FOR. HOLDING FOR THE- TO SPEAK. OF THE PHD IN PRODUCED BERKELEY AND I'M HERE PAY REPRESENT THREE FIFTY SO VALLEY. AND NOT I TRIED ESSENTIALLY SO- THE BASIC DIRECTION THAT JOHN TO PRESENT- OR THIS BILL THIS BILL HAS A VERY LARGE GOAL TO ME DID. OF GREEN HIDE INTO. HOWEVER IN IN THE LARGEST THAT IN THE DEEP. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS WHICH IS BELIEVED TO OUR INTO. DETECTORS DEFINITION OF THE TERM GREEN HYBRID. WHICH APPEAR EIGHTEEN IN THE WITH BILL. SO I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE THAT EVERYWHERE IN THE BILL THAT TO TURN GREEN HYDROGEN PEERS BETTER BE REPLACED BYTURN GREEN ALECTRA LATER CARTER CAME. AND THAT THE DEFINITION OF PEAS AND PETER SEE FOUR HUNDRED POINT TO BE MODIFIED AS FOLLOWS QUOTE. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN NEED HYDROGEN GAS PRODUCED THROUGH A PROCESS OF WATER. USING ELECTRICITY FROM WIND SOLAR HYDRO OR GEOTHERMAL SOURCES AND DOES NOT INCLUDE HYDROGEN GAS THEN STARTED USING CARBON CONTAINING. FEEDSTOCKS IN COURT. THESE CHANGE WILL HELP ENSURE THE HYDROGEN GAS PRODUCED. WILL NOT ANY- OR MIDDLE AMOUNTS OF CARBON AND WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS MEETING IT'S TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FIFTY CARBON EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOALS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TO THIS AND I HOPE THAT. WE WILL GET OUT OF THE BILL SB EIGHTEEN THAT ACHIEVES ITS DESIRED GOALS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT- DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES- NONE THAT I CAN SEE BUT IF WE OKAY ON THE VERY TOP OF WITNESSES IN THE BACK OF THE CHAMBER OF THE FLOOR OR THE GALLERY WE HAVE SOMEONE IN THE GALLERY. IN OPPOSITION OR IN BETWEEN THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY ON S. B. EIGHTEEN. COULD HAVE SO STATE YOUR NAME. DIGITIZATION ON YOUR POSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY WORKERS UNION OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT I THINK I MAY HAVE MISSED THE- SUPPORT QUEUE EARLIER THEY GIVE. YOU'RE GOOD. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE PHONE LINES- THEY'RE OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY ON S. B. EIGHTEEN PHONE MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANYONE ON THE LINE THAT WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OPPOSITION OR SHARE THEIR CONCERNS ON SB EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU TO STATE SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHTEEN ME PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE. YEAH THAT'S ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. SURE AT THIS TIME WE HAVE FIVE IN. WE HAVE TEN IN Q.

NEXT WE HAVE LINE. TWENTY TWO. ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS AND SUPPORT. NEXUS LINE. TWENTY FOUR. GOOD AFTERNOON STEVE WALKER YOUR SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF- THE SENATOR TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA TRANSIT DISTRICT COURT THAT EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU. WE HAVE LINE. THIRTY THREE ZERO. GOOD AFTERNOON DILLON JAFFA BEHALF CAL START IN SUPPORT AT THE EIGHTEEN. LINE TWENTY TWO ZERO. DANIEL GUTIERREZ ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK WITH THE CONCERNED POSITION I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OFFICE OFFICE. NINE TWENTY NINE. GOOD AFTERNOON- SHAREHOLDING COMMITTEE MEMBERS TIM CARMICHAEL WITH SEMPRA ENERGY UTILITY IN SUPPORT OF SB. EIGHTEEN NINE THIRTY TWO. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MEMBERS CAN BE ON BEHALF OF U. A. W. WESTERN STATES IN SUPPORT OF SB. EIGHTEEN WHAT ON NINE TWENTY SIX. HELLO THIS IS RYAN MCCARTY ON BEHALF OF AQUA HI GREX AND MAGNUM DEVELOPMENT BOTH IN SUPPORT. YOU HAVE LYING. EIGHTEEN GOOD AFTERNOON JULIA LEVIN WITH THE BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOALS OF SB EIGHTEEN BUT WE ARE IN A SUPPORT REPRESENTATIVE SESSION WE SUPPORT THE CHANGE TO REMOVE THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE LIMITED TO ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN HYDROGEN FROM ORGANIC WASTE CAN BE EVEN LOWER CARBON AND PROVIDE MANY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS SO WE THINK ADOPTING THE DEFINITIONS IS IMPORTANT BEFORE LIMITING PROGRAMS TO SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES. WE ALSO URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT ANY HYDROGEN POLICIES FOCUS ON IN STATE- DELIVERED HYDROGEN AND NOT SUBSIDIZED PAPER ONLY TRANSACTIONS. GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT THIS TIME THEY'RE NOT FOR THE LINE TO KEEP. THANK YOU- THAN EXHAUSTS OUR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM AT THIS MOMENT SO WE'LL TURN TO. OTHER COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NO TO THAT ON THE AMENDMENTS WHEN THE COMMENTS WERE MADE AROUND- GREEN HYDROGEN THAT THE AMENDMENT STRIKE ALL PROVISIONS MANDATING GREEN. ELECTRO WHAT POLITIC HYDROGEN BE CONSIDERED IN PEACE THE ACTIONS. XCERRA SO- MISS OF THE CENTER SKINNER IF YOU WANT TO ELABORATE ON SOME OF THE RESPOND IN MORE DETAIL TO SOME OF WHAT YOU HEARD- FEEL FREE BUT WILL WILL TURN TO MEMBERS NOW DOCTOR QUIRK- AND MISTER MURATSUCHI YES THANK YOU. UP FOR THE OPPOSITION I THINK THAT THEIR DEFINITION OF GREEN HYDROGEN IS TOO LIMITED. FOR ONE IT WAS JUST SOLAR AND WIND FOR THE OTHER WITH SOLAR WIND. GEOTHERMAL AND HYDRO I DO THINK BIOENERGY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. ARMED I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND IS GOING TO CONSIDER DIRTY FOSSIL FUEL MAKING HYDROGEN GREEN HYDROGEN AYE. I DON'T EVEN THINK WE HAVE TO MENTION THAT- THE AUTHOR WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE HAS A GOOD. VIABLE DEFINITION EITHER AL OR LEAVING IT UP TO- THE- AGENCY. SO I VERY MUCH SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I'D LIKE TO ASK TO BE CO AUTHOR. CERTAIN ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THAT COULD OCCUR. MR MURATSUCHI THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ALSO. I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN THE BANDWAGON TO BE ASKED TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR- I REMEMBER WHEN TOYOTA WAS STILL IN MY DISTRICT THAT- IF THEY WERE VERY EXCITED TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR- HYDROGEN MIRAI AND- THEY WERE SO EXCITED THAT YOU KNOW THE EXHAUST THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD BE COMING OUT AS WATER. AND- COURSE I WAS ALL EXCITED TO BECAUSE IT. SEEMS TO BE SUCH A PROMISING TECHNOLOGY AND STARTED. LEARNING MORE ABOUT ALL THE- AS THE HOUSES POINTS OUT THE HYDROGEN COLOR WHEEL YOU KNOW THE WHOLE ANALYSIS AS TO HOW. CLEAN OR HOW DURING THE PROCESS IS IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCTION. OF THE HYDROGEN FUEL. I WANTED TO THE SATURDAY KNOW THAT THE THAT THE CHILDREN NINE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT THE WE HAD THE- LEAD TO A DELEGATION OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO JAPAN. WHILE ON A TRIP SPONSORED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN WHERE WE TOWARD IN IN PARTICULAR THERE WAS A- WE WANT TO FOCUS IN A- WHICH UNFORTUNATELY NOW IS. YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF IT IS BECOMING A NUCLEAR WASTELAND BUT- THEY'RE CERTAINLY TRYING TO CREATE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE THEY THEY- DEMONSTRATED THIS THEY THEY HAVE THIS HYDROGEN. DEMONSTRATION PLANNED WITH A USE ALL SOLAR. TO PRODUCE- GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN- AND THEY WORK SHOWCASING HOW THEY WANTED TO USE A NOT ONLY AN- TRANSPORTATION NOT ONLY FOR. CARS BUT ALSO THE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS I AS AS THE YOU KNOW THE TO TWO FEET AND POWER HOMES- AND SO WITH THE- YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY EXCITING THAT- THAT CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW IS- HOPEFULLY NOT GOING TO. BE LEFT BEHIND BUT- IS GOING TO BE PART OF THIS THIS IS A VERY. EXCITING GOOD A TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS THE SUPPORT OF OUR FRIENDS WITH THE BUILDING TRADES AS WELL AS- ARE YOU ARE ARE UTILITIES. AND ENERGY PRODUCERS AND SO. ON I WANT TO ASK YOU THOUGH. IF YOU'RE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR ORIGINAL BILL WAS PROPOSING A DIFFERENT TO LIMIT THE USE OF A- HYDROGEN- TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCESS THE I. R. P. AND FUTURE ENERGY STORAGE PROCUREMENT GOES SAID BASED ON YOUR- EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING THAT GREEN HYDROLYTIC AND HYDROGEN IS IN FACT. THE ONLY ASSURED- GREEN RENEWABLE- HYDROGEN FUEL. THROUGH THEIR THIS ARM THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION SO AND I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF- OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA STARTED TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO HYDROGEN BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS BUT AT THAT POINT WE THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS WERE PRIMARILY USING FOSSIL FUELS AND IN FACT THE CARBON PROFILE PARTRIDGE IN AT THAT TIME WAS NOT SOMETHING I THINK THOSE OF US WHO REALLY WANT TO DECARBONISE WOULD BE WOULD HAVE ADVOCATE. BUT OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW TECHNOLOGIES IMPROVE A LOT TO RESEARCH INVESTMENTS AND WE NOW KNOW WE NOT ONLY DO WE KNOW THERE IS A PART OF IT WAS COST IT IS BECOMING MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN THROUGH OTHER MEANS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE- MADE SUCH HUGE INVESTMENTS IN SOLAR AND WIND AND OTHER RENEWABLE SOURCES. AT THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AT TIMES OVER PRODUCTION SO THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO USE THAT TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN NOW IS POINTED OUT BY OUR COLLEAGUE DR CORK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO PRODUCE NON BROWN OR NON CARBON HYDROGEN AND SO JUST STEPPING BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN I CARRIED BILL AND WE GAVE A DEFINITION TO GREEN ELECTRIC HYBRID ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN THAT DEFINITION STANCE WE HAVE A STATUTORY DEFINITION FOR GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN. NOW IF WE DO NOT OR IF WE FOR PURPOSES OF SAY THIS BILL ARE UNABLE TO LAND ON A BROADER DEFINITION THEN IN EFFECT THE STATUTORY DEFINITION THAT EXISTS IS THE ONE THE GREEN ELECTROLYTIC SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE REALLY CONCERNED THAT WE MAY GO IN A DIRECTION THAT WOULD BE NOT GREAT FOR CARBON THEY DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT AT THIS MOMENT YEAH. WE UNDERTOOK AN EFFORT TO COME UP WITH. THE DEFINITION INVOLVING A LOT OF STICKLE- SO WE JUST HAVE ONLY YET YOU KNOW THINGS ARE TRICKY. SO WE'LL KEEP TALKING. AND WE'LL DO OUR BEST- BUT FOR THE MOMENT I THINK WE ARE QUITE SAFE THOSE OF US WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CARBON SIDE OF IT. TO STILL PROCEED BUT THIS ADDITIONALLY DOES NOT LIMIT OUR AGENCIES FROM PLANNING NOTICE THAT THIS IS PLANNING. FROM PLANNING ON HOW TO UTILIZE. THE HYDROGEN ON A BROADER WAY SHOULD WE BE AT A PLACE WHERE WE EITHER COME WITH A GREAT DEFINITION OR LAND ON A WAY TO. TO ACT- PRODUCE EXTRACT WHATEVER HYDROGEN IN ADDITIONAL WAYS THAT ARE LOW TO NO CARB SO THAT'S WHY I AM COMFORTABLE WITH HOW WE ARE PROCEEDING. THANK YOU FOR THAT- MISS CARRILLO AND THEN MISTER GARCIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL I TOO WOULD LIKE TO WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT B. AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN ENOUGH COAUTHORS WHILE STRONGLY BELIEVE IN AND WHAT YOUR INTENT IS I AM A VERY CLEAR I AM SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE AMENDMENTS TO TAKE OUT THE P. U. C. I. A. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION A YEAR TWO YEARS FROM NOW ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE P. YOU SEE. TO ADDED HYDROGEN AS PART OF A STRATEGIC PLAN WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THEY OUT TO BE THINKING ABOUT ON THEIR OWN AND THE HEARING THERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LATER I THINK IT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY AS WELL TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEIR STRATEGIC PLAN OVERALL IS TO ACHIEVE. OBVIOUSLY LOWERING OUR ARE. A REDUCTION OF FOSSIL FUELS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. WORKING ON THE VERY REAL NEED TO. UPDATE THE GRID CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES THINK ABOUT RENEWABLE ENERGIES FROM OUR DIVERSE PORTFOLIO. PERSPECTIVE SO WHILE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BILL IS MOVING FORWARD AND HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON HOW WE ACTUALLY ACHIEVE. THE LARGER SCOPE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE AND FOR AREAS LIKE MINE AND OTHERS THAT. A WHILE I REPRESENT A VERY. URBAN DANCE COMMUNITY. UP WE STILL GET NOTICES FROM LADWP DURING SEARCHES. NOT TO PLUG IN. VEHICLES BECAUSE THE GREAT CAN'T HANDLE IT. AND SO WHILE WE- AIM TO ACHIEVE. ARE THESE INCREDIBLE GOALS WE NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET THERE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT THANK YOU. RESEARCH YEAH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I WILL BE SUPPORTING AND I DID JUST WANT TO POSE. THE QUESTION- FOR THE PUBLIC FOR STAKEHOLDERS IN MY DISTRICT- WE HAVE ALTERNATIVE FUEL DEVELOPMENT FUNDED BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION. AND THERE'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN- APPROVING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE- D'AMICO ETHER- RENEWABLE TIME OF EITHER- TO MEET OUR WORLDWIDE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ON CLIMATE AND ACHIEVING. A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STEPS TO BE ABLE TO. DEMONSTRATE AND AROUND THE WORLD VOLVO TRUCKS MACK TRUCKS AND OTHER. TYPES OF- COMPANIES HAVE UTILIZED THIS- FUEL RENEWABLE FUEL. TO BE ABLE TO DECARBONISE- THE FOOTPRINT AND- THIS COMPANY IS LOCATED IN MY DISTRICT AND- BRAWLEY CALIFORNIA. THAT HAS- BROUGHT TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF- JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND WE KNOW THAT IT ALIGNS WITH- EXPENDABLES AN OBJECT OF SOME OPEN THAT- THERE WILL BE A SPACE- FOR THIS CONVERSATION AS WELL IN THE BILL. AS IT MOVES FORWARD AND I KNOW YOU'VE COMMITTED TO DO THAT BUT JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT THAT. KNOWN AS STATED. FOR THE RECORD. GREAT THANK YOU. GARCIA. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS SPACE- I'M GONNA BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TO THE I DO THINK IT MERITS AS TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION ON THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING. AND I THINK WE SHARE THE COMMON GOAL THAT AS WE'RE DOING THIS WORK ENSURING THAT. THE BALLISTIC PROFILE PICTURE OF CARBON YOU KNOW AND IN THIS PROCESS IS LIKE THAT WHICH WHEN I LOOK AT THE OPPOSITION. WELL I DON'T KNOW THEIR AMENDMENTS THEMSELVES ARE ACCURATE I DO THINK THE CONCERNS OR ISSUES THAT WE SHARE AND WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET RIGHT AND SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND AFT MOMENTS BEFORE TO HAVE INPUT ALONG THE WAY IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHERE IT'S EITHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE'LL SAY NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE- I WAS I JOIN WITH THE MEMBERS AND CONTINUE INTO- KNOWLEDGE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND- NOT JUST THE SPACE BUT RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO EXPLORE A VARIETY OF RENEWABLE OPTIONS THAT GET US TO OUR GOAL BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND CERTAINLY WITH THAT BEING THE DRIVER AND THIS BEING A PLANNING BILL IT CERTAINLY GIVES US THE FOUNDATION TO BUILD ON YOUR PREVIOUS WORK BUT ALSO ALLOWS US TO. CONTINUE TO LOOK AT HOW TO BE MORE GRANULAR AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT EFFORTS AND SO- WELL LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO JOIN YOUR BILL AS A CO AUTHOR I DON'T DO THAT VERY OFTEN BUT I THINK THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE THAT IS- A VERY APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE OPTIONS. AND SO WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR AND WILL LAST FOR. IT HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING. COMMENTS THEY WERE HAPPY TO RECEIVE AT THIS MOMENT. I DEFINITELY REMAIN COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT. WE ARE NOT PURSUING A HYDROGEN THAT WOULD. EXACERBATE OR RATHER BE. CONTRARY TO OUR DECARBONISATION GOALS SO YOU HAVE THAT TOTAL COMMITMENT ON MY PART AND- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU AMOUNTS SECRETARY CALLED THE HOLDEN PRO THE ACTION ON THE MOTION. SB EIGHTEEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED NATURAL RESOURCES HOLDEN HI HOLDEN AYE PATTERSON.

A LOCALLY PUBLICLY OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITIES INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION MISTER WHAT KOWSKI ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- MEMBERS THIS MEASURE WOULD REQUIRE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN SUBMITTED BY PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES IS DEFINED BY THE BILL IN THIS EXPLAINED IN THE STAFF REPORT INCLUDE DETAILS ON THE ELECTRIC. THE TRICITY RATE DESIGN FOR THE TRANSPORTATION RECOLLECT FOR CATION AS A STEP TOWARD TALKS OUT OR EXPLAINS RECRUITMENT CURRENTLY- OBTAINING INFORMATION ON LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES BUT THEY DO NOT INCLUDE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL. SIMPLY DOES A LOT OF INTEREST IN THIS FLOOR IN THE FLOOR IN THE SENATE ON THE EMISSIONS FROM HEAVY MEDIUM- DUTY VEHICLES EXPLICITLY PROVIDING THAT ALL SECTORS OF TRANSPORTATION WITH CATION- INTO THE INTEGRATED WE- PLANS ENSURES THAT WE COULD. COMPREHENSIVE ELECTRICITY RATE DESIGN AND THAT ALLOWS THE- USERS OF POTENTIAL USERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COST CONSIDERATIONS ARE GOING TO BE PERFECT ZIP TECHNOLOGY FOR BOTH VEHICLES AND FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH WITH THAT. I RESPECT THE LAST FOR AND I PUT. THERE'S A MOVE MOTION BY A MEMBER GARCIA DR CORPUS SECOND. OF WE'LL LOOK AT- WITNESSES AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NO PRIMARY WITNESSES AND- SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION.

TWENTY TWENTY MARKED A RECORD SETTING YEAR OF WILDFIRES AND OUR STATE WHICH WERE COMPOUNDED BY PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. WE ALSO HAD ROTATING OUTAGES SHUTTING OFF OUR LIGHTS. AND GREATLY IMPACTING THE HEALTH SAFETY AND COMFORT OF CALIFORNIANS. REFACED THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC INSURED PROTECTIONS WERE IN PLACE FOR VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS SO THEIR WATER ELECTRIC AND GAS SERVICES REMAIN STABLE EVEN WHEN FACING MANAGER MANY DIFFICULTIES OUTSIDE THE HOME. THESE ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED JUST A FRACTION OF THE WORK FACED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THE REGULATORY ENTITY CHARGED WITH OVERSEEING OUR VITAL SO THE UTILITY SERVICES AND THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. THE ENTITY CHARGED WITH ENSURING RATEPAYER INTERESTS ARE REPRESENTED AND HER. TODAY WE INVITE THE LEADERS OF THESE AGENCIES TO COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE ON THE WORK THAT HAS OCCUPIED THEIR AGENCIES THE PAST YEAR. WITH THAT LET ME WELCOME PRESIDENT WHERE BILL BADGER. OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO PROVIDE HER OPENING REMARKS. PRESIDENT BOETTCHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND GOOD AFTERNOON SHAREHOLDER AND VICE CHAIR PATTERSON AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION'S ACTIVITIES OVER THE PAST YEAR. RIGHT FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS MERRY BELL BACHELOR AND I SERVICE THE PRESIDENT OF THE C. P. U. C. I'M JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY. TO ASSIST ME IN ANSWERING ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. RACHEL PETERSON IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CPUC. AND EDWARD RANDOLPH IS A DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ENERGY CLIMATE AND POLICY AND CAROLINE THOMAS JACOBS DIRECTOR OF THE WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION I JUST WANTED TO NOTE MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT WE ARE NOT WEARING MASKS- THE THREE OF US ARE FULLY VACCINATED AND HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME AND WE'RE IN. OUR SOUND SACRAMENTO OFFICE AT THREE HUNDRED CAPITOL MALL. AND BEFORE I BEGIN MY PRESENTATION I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT STATEWIDE EXTREME HEAT CONDITIONS. AND THE PRESSURES IT IS CREATING ON THE GRID. FOR IT BEGIN EVEN SAY NOT I WILL NOTE THAT CAL AYE SO JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO NOTIFIED ALL OF US THAT THERE WILL BE A FLEX ALERT CALLED FOR TOMORROW. I BELIEVE IT WILL BE BEFORE THE HOURS OF FIVE AND TEN AND PEOPLE WILL BE INSTRUCTED TO. ACT ACCORDINGLY UNDER THE RULES OF THE FIVE SIMILAR. ON THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS OPERATOR AS WELL AS THE CQC AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. ARE CLOSELY MONITORING TEMPERATURES IN GREAT CONDITIONS. GIVEN THE WIDESPREAD HEAT WAVE THAT WILL CONTINUE OVER MULTIPLE DAYS CONSUMER. CONSERVATION MAY BE NEEDED TO HELP STABILIZE THE GRID AS I JUST NOTED. WHILE THE CALIFORNIANS MAY BE CALLED TO CONSERVE POWER AS THEY NOW HAVE BEEN. THE CAL AYSO BELIEVES. WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE GRID THROUGHOUT THESE CONDITIONS. NEVERTHELESS WE WILL REMAIN VERY GOOD JUDGMENT. THIS WEEK'S WILL RECORD BREAKING TEMPERATURES ARE REMINDERS THAT THIS SUMMER IS LIKELY TO BRING MANY HOT DAYS ACROSS THE WEST AND THAT MANY OF THE ADJUSTMENTS THE CPUC CAL AYE SO AND THE CC. PUT INTO PLACE FOLLOWING LAST YEAR'S ROLLING OUTAGES WILL PROBABLY BE NEEDED TO HELP AVERT OUTAGES SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR CONDITIONS IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR. I WILL ADDRESS LATER IN MY PRESENTATION OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF OUR STATE OF PREPAREDNESS FOR THE EVENT SUCH AS THESE. WITHOUT TELEVISION WE I WILL BEGIN MY PRESENTATION. SINCE JOINING THE CQC I LIKE YOU HAVE WITNESSED THE IMPACTS OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES PS PS OUR PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS AND LAST AUGUST AS ROLLING OUTAGES HAVE HAVE ON CALIFORNIANS. THESE EVENTS ARE DEFINED AND PRIORITIZE MY HAVE DEFINED AND PRIORITIZED MUCH OF OUR WORK AT THE C. P. U. C. OVER THE LAST YEAR. THESE ARE MATTERS THAT CUT ACROSS THE CORE THE CQC'S MISSION TO ENSURE SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE UTILITY SERVICES. GIVEN THAT I WILL BE FOCUSING MY PRESENTATION ON THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST ON OUR MINDS AND YOURS DURING INSURING CALIFORNIANS ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE A GRID THAT IS SAFE AND THAT THEY CAN RELY ON IN THE FACE OF A RAPIDLY CHANGING CLIMATE. I OVER MY BRIEF UPDATES ON OUR EFFORTS TO DRIVE UTILITIES TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF IT DOES AND OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE RELIABILITY THIS SUMMER. I WILL THEN PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON OUR WORK TO GUARANTEE THE ONGOING RELIABILITY OF THE GRID FOR THE FUTURE WITHOUT COMPROMISING OUR STATE'S AMBITIOUS AND NECESSARY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. I WELCOME YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION ON THESE ISSUES AS THESE AS THEY ARE MATTERS THAT REQUIRE WIDESPREAD EFFORTS AMONG ALL OF THIS. WITH REGARD TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW SHUTTING POWER- OFF TO AVOID CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES CREATES A MAJOR DISRUPTION FOR THE PUBLIC AND CREATE SICK AND CAN CREATE-SIGNIFICANT SAFETY. CONCERNS FOR EVERYONE. WITH THIS UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE MADE VERY CLEAR TO THE STATE'S INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THAT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS MUST BE USED AS A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT WITH WILDFIRE FOUR MILE FIVE WILDFIRES SKEWS ME MITIGATION AND EACH YEAR. THEY MUST WORK TO REDUCE THE SCOPE DURATION AND FREQUENCY OF THE PS PS EVENTS. SYSTEM JUST DISASTROUS POWER SHUT OFFS OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE UTILITIES HAVE MADE IMPROVEMENTS DUE IN NO SMALL PART TO OUR AGGRESSIVE AND DEEP REACHING OVERSIGHT OF THEIR CORRECTIVE ACTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POWERSHOT. GUIDELINES AND RULES WHEN I SAY WE I WILL ALSO INCLUDE IN THAT THE- CAL THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE STOP SKEWS ME THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND CAL. FIVE WE HAVE BRIEFED. OUT YOU BEFORE ON OUR VARIOUS ACTIONS BUT SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE ADOPTED TWO SETS OF UPDATES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO THE POWERSHOT GUIDELINES TO DRIVE UTILITIES TO IMPROVE THEIR COMMUNICATIONS AND COORDINATION WITH THE IMPACTED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBES AND MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS. AND TO TAKE APPROACHES THAT REDUCE THE SCOPE FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF OUTAGES IF CALLED. WE HAVE FOCUSED TARGETED ATTENTION I. P. GENIES ACTION IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND SCE'S ACTION IN TWENTY TWENTY TO THE UTILITIES UNDER PERFORMANCE IN THOSE YEARS. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON ENSURING COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS ARE CONVENIENTLY LOCATED IMPROVING HOW THEY IDENTIFY AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE MEDICALLY VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS AND SPEEDING UP AND EXPANDING THEIR BACKUP PATRICK PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THEIR CUSTOMERS DURING A P. S. P. S. OF THAT. WE HAVE ALSO ISSUED A REQUIREMENT FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS TO INSTALL SEVENTY TWO HOUR BACKUP POWER TO ENSURE THE PROVISIONS OF ESSENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES IN THE POWER SHUT OFF. IN IN POWER SHUT OFF IN THIS. TWENTY TWENTY WAS A VERY LONG FIRE SEASON AND CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF POWER SHUT OFFS BY THEIR UTILITIES. WELL THE NUMBER OF THE P. S. P. S. DEFENSE WENT UP THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS OUTAGES HOURS HOWEVER WENT DOWN BOTH PG&amp;E AND EDISON REDUCED OUTAGE HOURS IN TWENTY TWENTY. LOOKING AHEAD TO THIS YEAR AFTER A DRY WINTER AND WARM SPRING THE STATE IS LIKELY IN STORE FOR A LONG AND VERY DIFFICULT FIRE SEASON. CCL SEN IN FACT I HAS ALREADY- THIS WEEK NOTIFIED CUSTOMERS OF A POP UP POSSIBLE PS PS IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. AS WE MOVE INTO THE FIRE WILDFIRE SEASON AND BEYOND WE ARE COMMITTED TO SPURRING CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN THE UTILITIES EXECUTION OF PSP ESTEVEZ AND INDEED REDUCING THE IMPACTS ON CUSTOMERS AND THESE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN BOLSTERED. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER BY OUR PARTNERS- YES AND CAL FIGHTER. WITH REGARD TO THE ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN TO HELP ENSURE RELIABILITY OF OUR ELECTRIC SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIANS THIS SUMMER FIRST I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE COLLEAGUES IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR PRESENT BEFORE YOU LAST MONTH. ON THE STATUS OF OUR READINESS FOR THE SUMMER. YOUR OVERSIGHT AND PARTNERSHIPS HAVE BEEN CRUCIAL TO OUR ON GOING EFFORTS. GIVEN THAT WE RECENTLY PRESENTED I WILL NOT SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ON THIS- ELEMENT AS YOU ARE ALL WELL APPRISED OF OUR ACTIVITIES HOWEVER AS I NOTED EARLIER AS WE HEARD IN AS WE HEAD INTO THE HOT AND DRY SUMMER. AS IS UPON US NOW WE ARE REMINDED THAT MOTHER NATURE CAN BE UNPREDICTABLE AND INDEED UNFORGIVING. A CHANGING CLIMATE IS MAKING EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HEAT WAVE IN JUNE AND SOME OF THE STATE'S RESERVOIRS ARE AT HISTORIC LOWS AND SNOW PACK IS ESSENTIALLY ZERO PERCENTAGE OF THE AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. WE MUST AND ARE RESPONDING TO THESE CHANGING CONDITIONS BY INCREASING. COORDINATION WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS UTILITY GENERATORS PROJECT DEVELOPERS DEMAND RESPONSE PROVIDERS AND LARGE INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS AND WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY MONITORING WEATHER CONDITIONS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. AS I STATED IN OUR MAIN OVERSIGHT HEARING THOUGH NO ONE CAN PREDICT WHETHER AND RESOURCE CONDITIONS WITH A 100% CERTAINTY WE KNOW WE ARE CURRENTLY IN A STRONGER POSITION THIS YEAR THAN LAST AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU APPRISED OF OUR VIEW ON THIS CHANGES AS THE SUMMER PROGRESSES. WHAT WE HADN'T NECESSARILY LASER FOCUSED ON RELIABILITY FOR THE SUMMER AND NEXT ARE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE CONTINUES FORWARD AND WILL ONLY ACCELERATE IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME. THE CLIMATE CHANGE INDUCED EVENTS OF LAST AUGUST ONLY FURTHER CRYSTALLIZED THE NEED TO BUILD A MORE RELIABLE GRID. BY WAY OF A ZERO CARBON RESOURCE. THE OUTAGES LAST SUMMER WHEN AN ACCEPTABLE. BUT A SILVER LINING HAS BEEN THAT IT HAS FURTHER RESULT FOR FURTHER TO OUR RESOLVE TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. TO POWER THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND TO LEAD THE FIGHT AGAINST CATASTROPHIC CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS COMMITMENT IS REFLECTED IN OUR LONGER TERM RELIABILITY AND PROCUREMENT PLANNING. OVER THE MEDIUM AND LONGER TERM THE CPUC MUST ENSURE THAT ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES UNDER OUR JURISICTION ARE PROCURING ENOUGH NEW RESOURCES TO MEET INCREASED DEMAND FROM CLIMATE CHANGE TO DO SHORT. EXTREME HEAT EVENTS AND INCREASED ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDING SECTORS. THOSE RESOURCES MUST BE AVAILABLE TO MEET DEMAND AT ALL HOURS INCLUDING THE SUMMER EVENING HOURS AS A SOLAR GENERATION IS DECREASING AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE ELECTRICITY DEMAND. FOR THE CBC MUST ENSURE THAT THESE NEW RESOURCES THEMSELVES SUPPORT OUR CLIMATE GOALS. TO MEET THE STATE'S FUTURE LIABILITY NEEDS WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ORDERING ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS. INCREASE IN PROCUREMENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AS PART OF OUR INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCEEDING. THIS WILL RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PLANNING RESERVE MARGIN THEN WE HAVE REQUIRED OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS IN ANTICIPATION OF INCREASED WEATHER RELATED STRESSES ON OUR GRID. ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS IS IN ADDITION TO THE APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF NEW NET QUALIFYING CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES THAT WILL COME ONLINE BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY FOUR. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AS A RESULT OF THE PRIOR CPUC ACTIONS THIS INCLUDES WIND SOLAR BATTERY STORAGE AND SOLAR PLUS STORAGE. WELL THE PURPOSE OF THE NEW PROCUREMENT IS PRIMARILY RELIABILITY TO REPLACE RETIREMENT OF DIAVEL CANYON NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AND THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING UNITS THAT. ALSO SUPPORTS OUR STATE'S LONG TERM GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOALS. SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO REPLACEMENT OF DAY OUT OF CANTON CANYON WE WILL REQUIRE THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES TO PROCURE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THAT COMES FROM FIRM ZERO EMISSION RESOURCES. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE LARGE AMOUNT OF ZERO EMISSION PROCUREMENTS THAT HAS ALREADY TAKEN PLACE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE DIAVEL RETIREMENT. FINALLY LOOKING AHEAD THE COMMISSION IS% EVALUATED AND STRONGLY INCLINED TO ADOPT A DECISION LATER THIS YEAR A THIRTY EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TARGETS IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE. FURTHER ACCELERATING OUR PATH TO ZERO CARBON ELECTRIC SYSTEM. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AND TO ALLOW ME TO ADDRESS YOU. ON ON A SUBSET OF CRITICAL ISSUES THAT THE CPUC IS CURRENTLY ADDRESSING AND I AND MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE AND WE ARE HONORED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MR VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR A PRESENTATION I KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WILL HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU BUT IT'S- MY PLEASURE BEFORE WE MOVE TO QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE TO INTRODUCE THE ACTING DIRECTOR AND- YET. KEEPING OUR- OF THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION WELCOME TO YOUR NEW POSITION. AND THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN HOLDEN. BOB GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN HOLDEN THAT MEMBERS OF THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS AMY IF HE COULD GO AND I HAVE BEEN DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE WITH ME HERE TODAY ARE GOING TO SERVE OUR IDENTITY FOR ENERGY SOURCE ON SEN WHY CAN'T PEOPLE WANT TO COMMUNICATIONS AND DARWIN WHAT. ARE MY CHEAP COUNCIL. ON MAY TENTH I WAS BY THE OFFICE TO PAY. LEAVE AND SOME OF THERE. APPOINTED ALTHOUGH I'M NEW TO THIS POSITION I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE FIRSTHAND THE PUBLIC ADVOCATES OFFICES WORK AND ADVOCACY OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. AS A CHARLIE THE COMMISSION'S LEGAL DIVISION AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AND MISSIONARY BISON. THERE'S NOTHING MORE REWARDING THAN BEING TASKED TO RUN AN ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES A STRONG VOICE FOR UTILITY CUSTOMERS. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT OVER THE PAST YEAR THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE CONTINUED ITS STRONG ADVOCACY WHICH CLOSELY HERE TO THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS HELP CALIFORNIANS ADVANCE ITS GOALS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE FACE OF THE PUBLIC NINETEENTH AND THEM. OUR ADVOCACY CONTINUED TO HELP INSURE THAT EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF THEIR ZIP CODE. HAS ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE SAFE AND RELIABLE UTILITY SERVICES. WE PROVIDED IN ADVANCE AND IT COPIES OF BOTH PROGRAM REPORT IN A SLIGHT DEATH HOWEVER IN THE INTEREST OF TIME- JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THESE DOCUMENTS WHICH YOU CAN REVIEW ACTUALLY FRAZIER. OUR MISSION IS TO ADVOCATE FOR THE LOWEST POSSIBLE UTILITY RATES CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY RELIABILITY AND THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOAL. RECEIVE THIS MISSION OUR TOP PRIORITIES R. ONE IS SURE THAT WE KNOW HOW THE PROCESS ANYONE PROPOSE UTILITY PROGRAM PROJECT LIKE IMPACT FASTER IS MONTHLY BILLS. TO ADVOCATE FOR THE THIRTY SPEAKS OUT ON THE BOAT WHEN THEY FAIL TO MANAGE THEIR SYSTEMS SAFELY AND RELIABLY. AND THREE HELP ADVANCE. THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. LAST YEAR PURCHASED IN THE HUNT AND NINETY SIX PROCEEDINGS FIVE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MEETINGS AT THE CTC YOU SEE. AN SUCCESSFULLY INTERACTED WITH THE PUBLIC IN OTHERS OVER A THOUSAND TIMES. AND PLEASE REPORT THAT WE SAFE CALIFORNIANS MORE THAN THREE POINT HREE BILLION DOLLARS A LOWER UTILITY REVENUES AND AVOID IT. OPERATING CRISIS LAST YEAR. PUT ANOTHER WAY FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT REPAIRS INVESTED IN OUR ORGANIZATION THEY RECEIVED OVER SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS IN RETURN. OUR ADVOCACY EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE THE BEST VALUE FOR THE CONSUMERS IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS PAST YEAR. AS WITH THE MISSION AND THE STATE AS A WHOLE ADDRESS THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THEM PROVIDE SEXUAL XLT SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS IN THE FACE OF SHELTER IN PLACE. WILDFIRES AND POWERSHOW OFFS WHEN THE LAW OF TIME AND INTERNET SERVICE. OUR EFFORTS HAVING BURKE DEATH. FROM ENERGY. THE REST HAVING THEIR SERVICE DESK. DUE TO NON DURING THE CAN. SUPPORTING THE USE OF. GENERATORS AND PRIORITIZING MY COULD BE INCENTIVES TO HELP KEEP THE LIGHTS ON FOR COMMUNITIES SUBJECT TO THE ENERGY STATION. SUPPORTING INCREMENTAL ALREADY RESOURCES. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO SOME OF THE LIABILITY NEEDS. REQUIRING WIRELESS PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE AT LEAST SEVENTY TWO HOURS THE FACT THAT OUR CUSTOMERS IN HIGH FIRED BRADBURY IS CONNECTED TO A POWER SHORTAGES. POWER OUTAGES. RECOMMENDING THAT WIRELINE BROADBAND SPEED INCLUDED IN THE UNIVERSAL LIFELINE TELEPHONE SERVICE PROGRAM AND RECOMMENDING THAT THE WATER REVENUE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM SURCHARGE ELIMINATED. THAT'LL LEVEL USED TO CUSTOMER BILLS BY 10220% I HOPE IS VERY BRIEF OF PRESENTATION SHOWS THAT DESPITE THE CHALLENGES OF THE PAST YEAR. THE PUBLICADVOCATE'S OFFICE THE SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. AS THE STATE REOPENS WILL CONTINUE TO SAFELY MEET OUR WORK LIVES AND OPERATIONAL NEEDS ASSISTANCE WITH THE STATE'S WORK HARD WORK COLLISON'S. WITH THIS. I'D LIKE TO INCLUDE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. UP ON SLIDES PLAN OF ARTS LIKE THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU I HAVE MY CONTACT INFORMATION AND I WELCOME YOU YOUR QUESTIONS AND- YELL OUT AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO I'D LIKE TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS THIS AFTERNOON. AND CERTAINLY- WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH BOTH OF YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS HEARING WITH QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD- KIND OF START OFF IF I COULD WITH SOME COMMENTS AND MORE DIRECTLY. FOCUSED TOWARDS THE CPUC SO PRESIDENT BASHER- I JUST LIKE TO- WILL REALLY RAISE A I THINK A ISSUE THAT IS WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE MORE OF A STRUCTURAL ISSUE. AND THAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE CPUC- FOR THE MOST PART WE WORK IN COORDINATION AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT PARTNERSHIP AND U. S. PRESIDENT- HAVING CONTINUE TO BE AN ABSOLUTE GEM TO WORK WITH PROFESSIONAL AND TIMELY AND RESPONSES TO OUR QUESTIONS IN OUR INQUIRY. BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE IS A DISCONNECT WITH THE CPC. FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE CPUC DOES NOT ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND A PUBLIC MATTER ON BILLS THAT GREATLY IMPACT YOUR WORK. WE LOOK TO YOU AS EXPERTS WHEN YOUR VOICE IS MISSING. FROM THAT DIALOGUE WE SUFFER. ADDITIONALLY WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSES A MEASURE. THAT PROVIDES CLEAR DIRECTION EXPECTATIONS TO THE CPUC. BUT THEN AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT MEASURE THOSE DIRECTIVES ARE NORD THAT ALSO ROADS THE RELATIONSHIP. THE ISSUE IT'S SIMPLY JUST A COMMENT. BUT WHAT I HOPE YOU TAKE HEART. TAKE TO HEART ESPECIALLY AND IMPLEMENTING THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVES AS WE GO FORWARD IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP. THAT FOSTER'S- HONESTY AND AS WE DEAL WITH DIFFICULT ISSUES IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET PUBLIC INPUT FROM THE CPSC TO HELP GUIDE OUR DECISION MAKING. AND AS I SAID LIKEWISE WHEN WE DO PUT FORTH CLEAR DIRECTIVES THE CPC IS TIMELY AND ACTING UPON THEM. SO I JUST OFFER THAT UP FOR SOME INITIAL COMMENTS- I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP. IN YOUR PRESENTATION MEMBERS MAY HAVE QUESTIONS- WHETHER IT'S ON A PS PS EVENTS SUMMER READINESS OUR OUR PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES GOING FORWARD- BUT- LET ME JUST SAY AS I SAID BEFORE ENJOY WORKING WITH YOU. BUT WE DO FIND THAT WE HAVE SOME TIME WHERE ARE WE DON'T GET THE PERFORMANCE THAT WE THINK WE SHOULD BE GETTING FROM THE CEBU CITY SO. WITH THAT- I WILL TOO IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS- BECAUSE LIKE RESPOND TO THAT I'M- HAPPY TO. AND THEN I'LL TURN TO OTHER MEMBERS. YES MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND AND I'M- I THINK YOU KNOW BY MANNER AND I HOPE ACTION THAT- I AM VERY DISHEARTENED TO HEAR THAT THAT- YOUR CONCERNS AND THAT I'M SURE OF OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND PERHAPS OTHER MEMBERS- REGARDING OUR LACK OF ENGAGEMENT ON BILLS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU. AS WELL AS- THOSE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVES THAT WE HAVE NOT ADHERED TO IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION I'M VERY DISHEARTENED AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING EVERYTHING THAT I CAN DO TO AND CHANGE THAT IMMEDIATELY AND I WELCOME ANY CALL ANY TIME ANY DAY OF THE WEEK FROM ANY MEMBER. WHO HAS A CONCERN OR BETTER YET HAS A QUESTION ABOUT- BILLS OR ABOUT ANY OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVES- AND I THINK MISTER SURE YOU KNOW YOU AND I HAVE HAD A EXCELLENT- OPEN RELATIONSHIP. AND I AM JOHN I HAVE ENJOYED THAT WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE BOTH THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS SO I APOLOGIZE PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY ON BEHALF OF THE CPUC FOR- ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE IGNORED OR IN ANY COMMUNICATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN LACKING IN AND AS I SAID I WILL DO EVERYTHING CORRECT THAT AND I APOLOGIZE TO YOU MISTER CHAIR. WHAT IT NO APOLOGY NECESSARY WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE RELATIONSHIP AND AS YOU SAY. WE HAVE A VERY GOOD ONE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO- US COLLABORATING BUT IT WAS THAT SIMPLE GIVEN THE NATURE OF THIS HEARING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT- AND IT'S NOT JUST. ANYTHING NECESSARILY NOW IT IS SORT OF INSTITUTIONAL AND SYSTEMIC THROUGH THE CPC OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THERE ALSO BEEN MORE RECENT ISSUES AROUND DIRECT ACCESS AND LEGISLATION THAT WAS ADDRESSING DIRECT ACCESS AND HOW. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE CALLED FOR WERE NOT NECESSARILY IMPLEMENTED OUT OF THE ACTION OF THE LEGISLATURE IN REGARDS TO THAT. PARTICULAR BILL AND- THERE BEEN OTHER INSTANCES I THINK THAT OTHERS. MAY HAVE THEIR OWN PARTICULAR. REMEMBRANCES OF THAT- THEY THEY CARRY WITH THEM BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE. AS WE'RE BOTH PUBLIC INTO ENTITIES THAT WE HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS IN A WAY WHERE. WE'VE HEARD OVER A PERIOD OF TIME SOME OF THE CONCERNS WELL WE HEAR OFTEN. SOME OF THE CONCERNS IN TERMS OF THE SLOW. MOVEMENT YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB IN TERMS OF TRYING TO CHANGE IT TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY BUT I THINK THAT THERE CONTINUES TO BE SOME. QUESTIONS OUT THERE AND AREAS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO PARTNER WITH YOU. IN YOUR ENDEAVORS IN YOUR EFFORT TO ADDRESS THOSE THOSE KIND OF ISSUES. ARE GOING TO TURN TO A THINK. OF MR TANG YOU HAD YOUR MICROPHONE UP FIRST AND- MURATSUCHI. IN THE MARKET. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR RAISING THAT POINT ACTUALLY WAS THE VERY POINT I WAS PLANNING ON RAISING SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR COMMENTS AND- THIRD TO MADAM CHAIR WHO I ALSO HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH DATING BACK TO HER- PREVIOUS SERVICE IN OUR STATE GOVERNMENT- IT IS. IT IS UNFORTUNATE- TO ECHO THE EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE I HAD WITH ONE OF MY- PIECES OF LEGISLATION. THAT WAS- DEALING WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY- TRYING TO. FIND USES FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY MONEY WHICH THE UTILITIES CHARGE US THE RATEPAYERS WHICH WE PAY FOR. AND UNFORTUNATELY CONTINUES OVER TIME TO NOT BE SPENT IN MORE TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH IS NOT BEING SPENT WE'RE TALKING UPWARDS OF. COULD BE FIFTY TO ALMOST A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF AGAIN RATEPAYER MONEY WHICH IS BEING USED FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AT A TIME WHEN WE'VE HAD TO SHUT OFF OUR POWER BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER- IN THE STATE- IN YET YOUR AGENCY- SEEM TO FEEL MORE IN I MEAN I JUST I DON'T BELIEVE THIS REFLECTIVE OF YOUR FEELINGS. MADAM CHAIR BUT MORE THE AGENCIES HOW- THE AGENCIES SEEM TO FEEL LIKE THIS WAS THEIR MONEY NOT THE RATE PAYERS MONEY- IT SEEMS TO BE A VERY UNFORTUNATE. THAT RATHER THAN. FIGURING OUT HOW WE COULD DEPLOY THIS MONEY. INTO ITS INTENDED PURPOSE WHICH WAS ENERGY EFFICIENCY- IT BECAME A POLITICAL TURF WAR. WHICH TO ME IS ABSOLUTELY NOT AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THE AGENCY. OR FRANKLY IS IT IS A WASTE OF TIME FOR ALL OF US WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON. AND WE COULD DEFINITELY USE- SMARTLY- ENERGY EFFICIENCY RESOURCES DEPLOYED AROUND THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRECIOUS ENERGY THAT WE DOOR PRODUCING IS BEING USED AS EFFICIENTLY. AS POSSIBLE- SO I WOULD REALLY URGE YOU AS YOU HAVE A VERY VERY DIFFICULT JOB AND I UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT THE JOB THIS IS MY OFFICE IS JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM YOUR OFFICE- OF REALLY. TURNING AROUND. THIS AGENCY THAT THE AGENCY. IS NOT THERE TO SERVE ITSELF BUT TO REALLY SERVE THE RATE PAYERS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. AND THAT AS IT'S TASKED WITH OVERSEEING FUNDS THAT CLEARLY HAVEN'T BEEN USED FOR WHATEVER REASON- IF THE AGENCY CAN'T SOMEHOW FIGURE OUT. HOW TO DEPLOY THESE RESOURCES THAT I'D WISH THEY'D GET OUT OF THE WAY THE LEGISLATURE AS WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND I THINK THAT IS- WHAT I JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE CHAIR IS TALKING ABOUT JUST BE VERY VERY SPECIFIC. IT WAS- EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING- INTERACTION BUT UNFORTUNATELY HAS BEEN INDICATIVE OF MY EXPERIENCE. IN WORKING WITH THE- WITH YOUR AGENCY IT PREDATES YOU. PRE DATES SHARE PICKER- YOU KNOW AND GOES BACK TO EVEN CHECK TV'S TIMES I DON'T I DON'T LOOK AT IT AS- A REFLECTION OF- REALLY ANY OF THE COMMISSIONERS IN ESSENCE BUT- UNFORTUNATELY MORE OF A REFLECTION. OF THE CULTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION WHICH I KNOW YOU HAVE A CHALLENGE TO TRY AND TURN AROUND. BURKE IT IS MY HOPE. THAT AS YOU HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TURNING AROUND OTHER AGENCIES THAT YOU ALSO BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND THIS AGENCY. BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS. LOST TRACK OF ITS MISSION. AND LOST TRACK OF WHOM IT IS SUPPOSED TO SERVE. AND SO I JUST IMPLORE YOU. TO KNOW THAT AS YOU PUSH AND MAKE CHANGES AS YOU'VE DONE IN SO MANY OF OTHER AGENCIES IN YOUR CAPACITIES TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMISSION IS SERVING THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. THAT I MYSELF AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AND WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF CHANGES AS YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE THEM TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMISSION HAS THAT MISSION AT HEART. THAT IS ENSURING THAT RATEPAYER MONEY IS GOING TO WHERE IT'S INTENDED TO GO RATHER THAN SITTING AROUND GATHERING DUST WHEN HE NEEDS TO BE CRITICALLY DEPLOYED SO WITH THAT I JUST THINK THE CHAIR FOR HIS OPENING COMMENTS BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE VERY REFLECTIVE. OF THE MINDSET OF NOT ONLY THIS COMMITTEE BUT REALLY OUR OUR ENTIRE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE A SEARS THE QUESTIONS- FIRST OF ALL IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- THE. THE BASIC LESSON THAT- I. BELIEVE THEY THE PC HAS ADMITTED TO LEARNING FROM LAST YEAR'S ROLLING BLACKOUTS. WAS THAT- THE- RELEVANT AGENCIES THE P. C. THE ENERGY COMMISSION THE I ALSO DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY PLAN FOR THE EXTREME HEAT. ARM IS ACT IS THAT CORRECT. MEMBER YES WE- DIDN'T THE THREE OF US KALISTO CC AND CPUC- INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY- IF YOU ARE A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FOUND THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS THAT FRANKLY WE NEEDED TO DO BETTER AND- THEY WERE BOTH- THE ENERGY DEMAND FORECASTING WHICH I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO INTO IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION. RESOURCE PLANNING AND CONTINGENCY CONTINGENCY PLAN INCLUDING DEVELOPING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR SUPPLY SIDE TRENDS IN NEIGHBORING STATES AND HOW THIS WILL IMPACT- CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS TO IMPORTED ENERGY- OVER TIME SO THERE WERE SEVERAL THEY WERE ACTUALLY FOR ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS ROOT CAUSES IN OUR ANALYSIS THAT WERE FOUND AMONG THEM THAT'S CORRECT FORECASTING WAS ON ONE OF THE ISSUES FORECASTING IN TERMS OF DEMAND. AND SUPPLY. SO IN IN IN TERMS OF THE FORECASTING FOR THE- DEMAND- GOING INTO THE FUTURE- DO YOU DO YOU HAVE LIKE A- YOU KNOW- WEATHER EXPERTS THAT ARE THAT ARE PROVIDING PROJECTIONS FOR YOU IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WORSE THE EXTREME HEAT CONDITIONS THE AND THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE EXPECTED TO GET. WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CAL AYSO AND SEE SEE THEY ALSO HAVE EXPERTS FORECASTING EXPERTS AS WELL AND- WE FORECAST BUT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MOST OF THE FORECASTING IS ON. ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION BUT- WE ALL HAVE VERY IMPORTANT MODELING THAT WE FOLLOW THAT AND HELPS US IN TERMS OF ARE ARE PLANNING FOR FUTURE PROCUREMENT. AND FUTURE THEREFORE FUTURE DEMANDS OF ON THE SYSTEM SO. WE HAVE THE INTEGRATED PLANNING RESOURCE PROCESS WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE INTERIM- I. R. P. PROCESS NOW IN FACT WE WILL BE THERE'S A PROPOSED DECISION THAT'S OUT ON THE STREET AND THE COMMISSION WILL BE VOTING ON IT AT THE END OF THE MONTH. BUT IT IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE WHERE IN- WE TAKE THE FORECASTING AND MODELLING. AND A LOT OF PUBLIC INPUT ON AND DECIDE WHAT ARM IS NEEDED FOR- FUTURE PROCUREMENT AND TO MEET THE DEMENTIAS AT OUR FORECAST IT. CURRENTLY THE I. R. IN THE INTERIM I R. P. IS REVIEWING THE YEARS TWENTY TWENTY THREE THROUGH TWENTY. TWENTY SIX. OKAY SO GET A GIVEN DAY THE CURRENT I. R. P. GOING OUT TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX DO YOU HAVE LIKE EXTREME HEAT PROJECTIONS. UP THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY SIX WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE MODEL ON IS DEMAND WHICH IS WHICH IS DRIVEN BY WEATHER CLIMATE CHANGE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND- POPULATION- TIMES DURING THAT THE DATE FOR EXAMPLE- CAL AYE SO DTERMINES. WHERE THAT DEMAND USUALLY LIES AND WE SPEAK YOU'LL HEAR SPEAK ABOUT THE NEXT PEAK AND THE- PEAK HOURS ACTUALLY THOSE HAVE CHANGED RECENTLY AGAIN WE ALL BELIEVE THAT IT'S DUE TO OUR SEVERE CLIMATE CHANGE AND- THE NEXT PEAK NOW HAS MOVED FROM- SAY THE LATER HOURS OF SEVEN TO THE LATER HOURS OF NINE PM. SO WE NOW ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HOURS BETWEEN FOUR PM AND NINE PM AND AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE- DECREASING SUPPLY PARTICULARLY IN SOLAR- IN THOSE HOURS WHEN THE SUN IS SETTING SO WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE PLENTY OF RESOURCES TO MAKE UP FOR THE DECREASE IN SUPPLY NOW THAT'S ALL PART OF OUR FORECASTING AND OUR MODELING THAT- ON C. B. U. C. DOES THE CDC MOST IMPORTANTLY DOES. AND IT'S ALSO INFORMED. BY AND THE CALLOUS SO. IN IN TERMS OF FORTY AND PLANNING I MEAN IT IS THAT THE- FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE FORECASTING. THE EXTREME HEAT CONDITIONS TO GET BACK INTO IT TO GET WORSE RATHER THAN BETTER. WELL WE AND AGAIN IT'S THE MODELING IN TERMS OF WHEN. WE MODEL TO DEMAND AND THAT'S PART OF THE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THE CURRENT I. R. P. IT'S ALSO- WHAT RESOURCES WERE WILL BE LEADING THE GRIT AND I THINK I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS ON. THE THAT THE RETIREMENT OF DIAVEL CANYON NUCLEAR POWER PLANT WILL BE RETIRING TWEEN. YEARS TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE IS A RESOURCE THAT WE ARE MAKING UP WITH IN OUR RESOURCE PLANNING- THAT WE'RE DOING CURRENTLY AND HAVE DONE IN PRIOR YEARS. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT BUT IN TERMS OF THE FORECASTING OF THE- OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND- THE THAT THE DEMANDS IN TERMS OF AIR CONDITIONING BACK THAT YOU'RE PROJECTING. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU'RE PROJECTING WORSENING EXTREME HEAT CONDITIONS RATHER THAN IMPROVE YEAH YEAH. OKAY YES WE ARE WE ARE. AND SO YOU A. YOU HAVE ACTUAL- STUDIES THE DATA IS PROJECTIONS IN TERMS OF THE DEGREE OF EXTREME HEAT. ARE EXPECTED TO BE- WORSENING. I'M GOING TO ASK- MISTER RANDOLPH TO ASSIST ME IN BEING MORE CLEAR WITH MY RESPONSE TO YOU SIR. AND YOU WANT ONE ANOTHER FROM THANK YOU PRESIDENT BASHER- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MERRY G. PART OF THE PROCESS HERE OUR FORECAST IS AS PRESIDENT BATRA SAID- INITIATES AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION- SO THEY WILL DO THE ORIGINAL DEMAND BOB FORECASTING BASED ON WHETHER- SO THE- QUESTION ON HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR. INCREASED ARM HEATWAVES INCREASED EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS- THAT'S BAKED INTO THAT CC'S MODELING AND WE SHOULD ADDRESS THAT TO THEM TO GET MORE TECHNICAL- WE NOTE FROM- THE PAST. SEVERAL YEARS BUT ESPECIALLY LAST SUMMER- FROM THE COLD SNAP AND- TEXAS THIS LAST WINTER- IN THE HEAT WAVE WE'RE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING WHICH IS YOU KNOW GOING TO BE RECORD TEMPERATURES FOR JUNE ACROSS- THE SOUTHWEST AND PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ON THAT WE DO HAVE THESE MORE EXTREME EVENTS THAT WE NEED TO THE PLAN FOR. I'M ON THE PC SIDE IN THE MEDIA- OUR FUTURE THE PLAN FOR THOSE WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE INCREASED WHAT'S ITS TECHNICAL TERM BUT RIVER OF REFERRED TO AS THE PLANNING RESERVE MARGIN- IN THAT WILL- ENABLE THE SYSTEM TO RESPOND AND BE READY TO INSTEAD OF RESPONDING TO A ONE IN TEN. WHETHER OF THAT- IT WILL BE CLOSER TO ONE THIRTY FIVE WEATHER EVENTS ARE FAR MORE EXTREME- WEATHER EVENT IN THE SUMMERTIME THAT'S AYE AYE SHORT TERM- I CHANGE THAT WE'VE JUST DONE- IN OTHER PROCEEDINGS WERE LOOKING AT MORE LONG TERM CHANGES- IN. THE ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE AROUND ARE FORECASTING. OUR THANK YOU SO GAY THAT- YOU ARE MAKING THE- FORECASTS OR OR YOU'RE YOU'RE RECEIVING THE FORECAST FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND YOU'RE MAKING PLANS ACCORDINGLY IN TERMS OF THE- THE ENERGY PROCUREMENT- MANDATE SO YOUR YOUR GIFT ISSUE TO THE- LOAD SERVING ENTITIES- I. WONDER WHAT BRING IT BACK TO MY DISTRICT- MISTER RANDOLPH IT IS YOU KNOW WELL AND- MS- BADGER YOU YOU MADE A REFERENCE TO THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING PLANTS- I HAVE ONE OF THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING- PLANTS IN MY IN MY DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF REDONDO BEACH THEY WERE PROMISED. IN A FOR TEN YEARS THAT THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING WOULD BE SHUT DOWN BY THE END OF TWENTY TENTY. IT SEEMS THAT- YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR WHERE WE'RE HEARING GOT. YOU KNOW I ANOTHER YEAR OF EXTENSION ANOTHER OF EXTENSION. WELL WHAT WHAT IS THE CURRENT PLAN IN TERMS OF- THE ONES THROUGH- PULLING SHUTDOWNS THEY WERE ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED FOR THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. I'M YES THANK YOU- THOSE ARE NOW SCHEDULED- ALL THE- TO SEIZE ONCE THROUGH COOLING- PLANTS ARE SCHEDULED NOW TO GO OFFLINE BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OKAY. AND IS THERE IS THERE ANY- ANY ANY GUARANTEE OR ANY ANY PROVISION THAT THAT WOULD BE THE LAST EXTENSION. WE CERTAINLY HOPE SO. DURING LAST THE TOPIC I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS- IS THE NET ENERGY METERING- SUBJECT- AS YOU MAY KNOW WE HAD A- THE BILL AND IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY- WHERE MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING MYSELF- HAVE EXPRESSED OUR FRUSTRATION WITH THE- PUC'S. AND ACTION- IN IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE COST SHIFT ISSUE WILL. THE NET ENERGY METERING OF. CAN YOU ASSURE US THAT THE P. YOU SEE WELL- ACT EXPEDITIOUSLY- IT'S IT SHOULD ADDRESS THE COST SHIFTING ISSUE- THAT THAT EXISTS WITH THE CURRENT NET ENERGY METERING SCHEME. YES SIR LET ME ADDRESS OUR TIME FRAMES ON AND WE HAVE HAD SOME DELAYS AND I ADMIT TO THAT- AND FOR WHICH OF. I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE BUT THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING TO MOVE THE NAM REVISIT PROCEEDING FORWARD- THIS YEAR THEY'VE WORKED HARD ON THAT IT IS ON TRACK TO ISSUE A PROPOSED DECISION ON THE MATTER BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ARTIE'S JUST TO RUN THROUGH THE SCHEDULE PARTIES WILL FILED TESTIMONY IN- THIS MONTH JUNE AND JULY. THE COMMISSION WILL HOLD EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS FROM JULY TWENTY EIGHTH THROUGH AUGUST SIX- PARTIES WILL FILE BRIEFS IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. THE COMMISSION WILL LIKELY ISSUE A PROPOSED DECISION THEREFORE IN DECEMBER THAT WILL BE VOTED ON- AFTER THE THIRTY DAY PERIOD WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE IN JANUARY BUT CERTAINLY RIGHT RIGHT- AT THAT DEADLINE. SO THAT'S OUR CURRENT SCHEDULE FOR- THE NEXT RECEDING WE REFER TO IT CASUALLY IS AN M. THREE POINT NO. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE FAIR. THANK YOU. BARKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT BADGER AND YOUR TEAM- FOR BEING HERE TO TALK TO US AND I WANT TO START BY X. BY THINKING YOU- I THINK THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR BACKUP POWER REQUIREMENT THAT YOU PUT INTO PLACE THIS YEAR WAS SO CRITICAL AS YOU I'M SURE AWARE SENATOR GLAZER INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT I CO AUTHORED TO DO EXACTLY THAT BECAUSE WE HAD IT PS PS EVENT IN WHICH WE HAD NO. AND TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS AVAILABLE WHILE A WILDFIRE BROKE OUT AND IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THE EVACUATION AS A RESULT WAS REALLY REALLY CHALLENGING AND OUR FIREFIGHTERS DID INCREDIBLE JOB AND EVERYBODY WAS SAFELY EVACUATED BUT IT REALLY RAISE THAT ISSUE AND I THINK YOU ADDRESSING IT AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS YOU DID DESERVES INCREDIBLE CREDIT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS WHAT ALL OF US HOPE IF YOU SEE WILL DO WE SEE A PROBLEM LIKE THAT ADDRESS IT AND CREATE EXPECTATIONS THAT WILL KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE FOR SO THANK YOU. I WANTED TO TOUCH ON SOMETHING THAT STRUCK ME AS I WAS READING YOUR ANNUAL REPORT. WHICH WAS ENFORCEMENT- AS I WAS READING IT AND I WAS READING SPECIFICALLY THE SAFETY AND- FOR SCIENCE. DIVISION THAT THEY- HAD FORTY SEVEN CITATIONS THIS YEAR. I BELIEVE WE PROBABLY HAD MORE THAN FORTY SEVEN VIOLATIONS IN MY DISTRICT ALONE- THE TOTAL. NUMBER OF THE AMOUNT THAT WAS FINED UNDER THEM WITH LESS THAN THREE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS IN STARK COMPARISON TO THE- FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT PG&amp;E SPENT ON OVERHEAD OUT OF THE WILD FIRE. FINE SO IF THE DROP IN THE BUCKET FOR THESE- UTILITIES AND IT STRUCK ME AS- REALLY NOT NECESSARILY AS AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION AS I WOULD HOPE TO SEE GIVEN THE RISKS AND THE COST TO CALIFORNIANS LIVES IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING THEM THAT ARE RESULTING FROM THE FAILURE FOR THESE UTILITIES TO DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO SO IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WERE TRYING TO STEP UP AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE UTILITIES ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE- YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR THE QUESTION AND FIRST IF I MAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS IN TERMS OF THE SEVENTY TWO. HOUR BACKUP I REMEMBER WELL WHEN FOLKS I BELIEVE IT WAS IN LAFAYETTE- WERE HAD NO. ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE. WITH FIRST RESPONDERS. AND HAD NO ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND- WHERE THE FIRE WAS MOVING IN THERE IN A P. S. P. S. N. NO CELL SERVICE SO. IT THAT EXAMPLE AMONG MANY STAYS VERY CLOSE IN MY MEMORY- I AM GOING TO TURN TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- PETERSON TO GIVE- SOME OF THE BACKGROUND ON THIS. SHE PREVIOUSLY HELD THE POSITION IN OUR- SAFETY DIVISION HERE AT THE P. UC. RACHEL YES THANK YOU PRESIDENT DR OTHER GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK IN PART WHAT IS- EXPRESSED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT THERE MIGHT BE A SLIGHT TIMING ISSUE AS FAR AS- THE TOTAL AMOUNT. OF PENALTIES AND CITATIONS THAT WE HAVE- THERE WE'VE ISSUED. I'LL JUST NOTE THAT LIKELY SEPARATE FROM. WHAT YOU'RE READING THERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. IS A NUMBER OF LARGER IN FORCE MAKE CASES. FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMISSION ISSUED A- TOTAL PENALTIES PACKAGE OF ONE POINT ONE BILLION AGAINST PGD. FOR ITS ROLE IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. OF WILDFIRES THAT OCCURRED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO IN ONE SENSE I THINK SOMETIMES WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT CITATIONS WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT. THE SMALLER QUICKER EXPECTATIONS THAT WE CAN IMPOSE AS STAFF. ON THE UTILITIES WHICH ARE SEPARATE FROM THE MUCH LARGER MORE THOROUGH. AND MORE FINANCIALLY- SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES THAT THE COMMISSION. CAN OPPOSE. VOTING AS AS A MEMBER BY- WITH THAT NEVER THE LESS I DEFINITELY TAKE YOUR- AND I TAKE YOUR QUESTION WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD ON. BUILDING UP OUR ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES THE COMMISSION ADOPTED AN ENFORCEMENT POLICY- LAST YEAR THAT APPLIES COMMISSION. AND IT'S SIX AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IVE BEEN WORKING ON ENSURING THAT ALL OF OUR DIVISIONS RANGING FROM ELECTRIC AND GAS TO WATER TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENERGY. ARE ALL- BUILDING UP THEIR ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN ACT MORE QUICKLY WHEN- THE OCCASIONS CALL FOR. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THE ONE POINT BILLION I'M REALLY FOCUSED ON PREVENTION RIGHT THE SMALL CITATIONS ARE THE ONES THAT FOCUS ON PREVENTION OF THE WILDFIRES UNDERSTAND YOU THEN FINE. AFTER THE WILD FIRES ARE CAUSED BUT I THINK WE NEED MORE AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE SMALL CITATIONS THAT WILL PREVENT WILDFIRES- AND THEN WE THAT I NOTICED SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT WAS VERY EXCITING IN THE ANNUAL REPORT. WHICH WAS THE P. JEANNIE M. SAFETY AND REPORTING MOBILE APP PILOT PROGRAM AND PART OF WHAT I HAVE REALLY BEEN FOCUSED ON IS HOW DO WE GET MORE ESPECIALLY IN TERRITORIES IS LARGEST P. JEANNIE. HOW DO WE GET MORE EYES ON THESE VIOLATIONS SO WE CAN SEE THEM PREVENT THEM AND STOP THEM AND SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN INTERESTING. PILOT THE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO LAUNCH THIS SUMMER AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT AND THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN ONCE YOU GET A CUSTOMER. TO TALK ABOUT A VIOLATION WHAT IS THE FOLLOW THROUGH TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SEEING FROM THE UTILITIES RESPONSIVENESS SO THAT. AGAIN WE'RE PREVENTING. WILDFIRES INCIDENTS I'M GONNA ASK RACHEL AGAIN WITH HER- FORMER HAPPEN ON- BECAUSE SHE CAN BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT THIS THANK YOU YES AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR THE QUESTION I AGREE I ACTUALLY QUITE LIKE THAT PROGRAM AND THE- IDEAS BEHIND IT I HAVE TO ADMIT ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M NOT- UP ON THE EXACT STATUS OF IT BUT WE'LL BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE ABOUT THAT- AND THEN AS FAR AS FOLLOWS THROUGH THAT IS THE GOAL OF SIXTEEN ENFORCEMENT DIVISION IS TO RECEIVE THOSE NOTIFICATIONS FROM CUSTOMERS ABOUT- A PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY NOTICE OR AND OVERHANGING LIMBS- YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE FARTHER REACHES OF PG&amp;E SERVICE TERRITORY. AND BRING IT TO OUR ATTENTION AND THEN WE WOULD- FOLLOW UP AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE- WE DO HAVE A NOTIFICATION SYSTEM OURSELVES IN WHICH WE IDENTIFY HAZARDS THAT ARE MORE URGENT COMPLETE AT THAT MORE URGENTLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND WE HAVE A WAY OF COMMUNICATING THAT STREET TO FIJI- BUT I WILL TAKE THAT QUESTION BACK TO OUR STAFF AND MAKE SURE WE GET AN ANSWER. THANK YOU WASN'T CLEAR TO ME THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY THE ONES RECEIVING THOSE NOTIFICATIONS. FROM CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY THINK THAT. A GOOD POINT OF CARE. AND YOU'LL BE SEEING THAT NOT JUST THE TOILET IS THEMSELVES. I'M SO LASTLY ONE ACTIVE ASK A QUICK QUESTION REALLY TOUCHING ON SOMETHING THAT- ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING. SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER WHICH IS THE SB THREE FIFTY GOAL- TO INCREASE OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND I NOTICED IN THE REPORT THAT YOU TALK ABOUT MOVING TOWARD THAT GOAL BUT DIDN'T ACTUALLY. CLARIFY WHERE WE ARE IN ACHIEVING OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS- AND YOU KNOW EIGHT. I AM AWARE THAT THE I USE ARE ALSO SPENDING LESS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY SO. GIVEN THAT WE'RE NOT SPENDING AS MUCH AS ASSEMBLY AVERTING NOTICE WE KNOW THE I USE AREN'T SPENDING AS MUCH AS WE WANTED ENERGY EFFICIENCY. I'M CURIOUS FOR AN UPDATE ON WHERE WE ARE IN ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR THE QUESTION AND I DID APPRECIATE- MEMBERED TANG'S COMMENTS AS WELL. HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THE ENERGY IS ENERGY EFFICIENCY BILL OF LAST YEAR. AND I THINK NOT TO NOT TO ON THE DEFENSIVE AT ALL BECAUSE I TAKE. YOUR CRITICISM VERY VERY WELL. AND I TAKE IT TO HEART AND I WILL DO THINGS. OUT OF HOWEVER WE WERE BEING. SOMEWHAT DRIVEN BY THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY- GUIDELINES IF YOU WILL AND WHAT CAN BE SPENT ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND WHAT CANNOT. AND THOSE FUNDS- CARRY OVER IF THEY'RE NOT USED IN ONE YEAR THEY DO KERRY TO THE NEXT. SO THEY'RE NOT LOST FUNDS BUT OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO UTILIZE AND AS FULLY. AS POSSIBLE MANY ASK MISTER RANDOLPH TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS. TO BETTER ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. YEAH AND THANKS AHMED SAID THANKS FOR THE QUESTION ON THE SB THREE FIFTY ENERGY EFFICIENCY GOALS WHICH REQUIRED A- SET A GOAL OF DOUBLING OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY. I AM WHAT I'LL REMIND FOLKS OF IS THAT'S NOT JUST THE DOUBLING OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY THAT COMES FROM THE- RATEPAYER FUNDED PROGRAMS ON THE DECEIVE YOU SEE OVERSEAS- BUT ALSO FROM THE- CODES AND STANDARDS IN OTHER PROGRAMS AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION OVERSEAS- AND AS YOU LOOK FORWARD YOU SEE MORE OF. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY- GAINS COMING FROM THOSE CODES AND STANDARDS PROGRAMS THAN YOU DO FROM THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY- RATEPAYER FUNDED PROGRAMS OUT THERE AND THE REASON WHY YOU SEE A DECREASE AND TOTAL FUNDING FROM. THE RATEPAYER FUNDED PROGRAMS IS THERE'S ALSO STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS- OUT THERE THAT THE RATEPAYER FUNDED PROGRAMS TO BE COST EFFECTIVE- AND SO THAT COMMISSION RUNS- BIANNUALLY A GOALS AND POTENTIALS PROGRAM OUT THERE THAT LOOKS AT THE TOTAL. GOAL POTENTIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY FROM THE RATEPAYER FUNDED INCENTIVE TYPE PROGRAMS- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT THE COMMISSION- IT HAS. MORE PROGRAMS GO INTO CODE MEANING THEY'RE MANDATORY- YOU HAVE LESS COST EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL- FOR THOSE- INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE. OUT THERE IN A GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE- WE USE THIS A LOT OF MY ON- LIGHTING- BECAUSE THAT WAS A VERY COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET- ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT- HOWEVER- BOTH IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL NOW THAT THERE ARE A VERY- YEAH VERY SPECIFIC VERY- AGGRESSIVE LIGHTING- CODES AND STANDARDS FOR- LED LIGHTS- AND OF LIGHTS THAT ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN THE OLD CONTACT- INCANDESCENT LIGHTS- OF THOSE HAVE BEEN. PHASED OUT OF THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT WE OVERSEE BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER NEED INCENTIVES ARE MANDATED COAT- AND SO YOU SEE THAT DECREASE THEIR- IN SO. LONG WAY TO GET TO YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION IS WHERE ARE WE ON THIS SB THREE FIFTY GOALS- WE ARE NOT ALL ON. TARGET TO GET TO THOSE GOALS AS A DOUBLING- RIGHT NOW- IF YOU LOOK AT IT STRICTLY AS AN ENERGY EFFICIENCY- PART- BUT THAT'S A JOINT AGENCY EFFORT IT'S NOT JUST THE UTILITY SPEND I DON'T THINK UTILITY SPEND GOING DOWN. IS WHAT'S KEEPING A SOFT TARGET HOWEVER ON THE FLIP SIDE- THIS STATE HAS VERY AGGRESSIVELY MOVED- TOWARDS BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION- AND WE ARE WORKING WITH- OUR SISTER AGENCY THE CC AND- BEER RESOURCES BOARD TO LOOK AT THAT FUEL SWITCHING OF MOVING PEOPLE FROM. USING NATURAL GAS TO USING ELECTRICITY- AND HOW THAT IMPACTS- OUR OVERALL ENERGY USAGE WHICH IS HOW WE SHOULD BE DEFINING THIS ENERGY EFFICIENCY GOING FORWARD AND NOT JUST LOOKING AT IT- FROM- ELECTRICITY STAVING STANDPOINT. THANK YOU KNOW I MEAN I DO THINK THAT THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE SEEING A SHIFT. IN A LOT OF WAYS YOU JUST MENTIONED WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER AS A LEGISLATURE. AND AN AGENCY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE CHANGES TO ENSURE WE ARE MOVING ENERGY EFFICIENT VEHICLES FORWARD IN GETTING TOWARDS THAT TARGET IS IT'S REALLY CRITICAL. BUT I THINK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THAT AND FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OF THIS GROUP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- THANK YOU PRESIDENT BETTER GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN I THINK THE FIRST TIME THAT WE CONNECTED WAS WHEN YOU HAD FIRST BEEN APPOINTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND- I KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN A VERY INTERESTING YEAR FOR ALL OF US RELATED TO KOBE DID EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED I WANNA- JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE CHAIR AND SEVERAL OF OUR COLLEAGUES. WHO HAVE- EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT AND FRUSTRATION WITH THE LACK TIME AND JUST HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET RESPONSES OR A MOVEMENT FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION I WANT TO BRING UP THE ISSUE OTHER WAS BROUGHT UP BEFORE AT THAT'S THE ISSUE OF NET ENERGY METERING AND WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT I WANT TO GO AND ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE REPORT THAT WAS. PUBLISHED BY THE P. UC IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR UTILITY UTILITY COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY OF THE GRID OF THE FUTURE AND EVALUATION OF ELECTRIC COST RATES AND EQUITY ISSUES- ON PAGE TWENTY EIGHT WHEN YOU GO TO WHEN THE STUDY THAT- YOU PRODUCED- SOME ALARMING INFORMATION. AND I'D LIKE TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST READ A LITTLE BIT- SO THAT WE ALL HAVE CONTACTS IN TERMS OF WHAT I'M DESCRIBING. WHEN IT COMES TO NET ENERGY METERING SNAM NAM CUSTOMERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY OLDER. LOCATED IN HIGH INCOME AREAS LIKELY TO OWN THEIR OWN HOME. AND LESS LIKELY TO LIVE IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. CONSEQUENTLY THE COST OF NET ENERGY METERING. ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY PAID BY YOUNGER LESS WEALTHY AND MORE DISADVANTAGED RATE PAYERS. MANY OF WHOM ARE RENTERS. TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN- IT'S NOTED THAT THE PC WILL BE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. UGH THIS YEAR MOVING FORWARD I REPRESENT A COMMUNITY- THAT IS 20% BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE. THAT IS- IN EAST LOS ANGELES AND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE. THAT IS NOT- SERVICE BY LADWP BUT BY AND THEN THE- AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY. EDISON IN IN THE SAME REPORT- IT STATES THAT AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL NAME COULD NUMB CUSTOMERS. AND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CARE CUSTOMERS PARTICIPATED- OR RECEIVE THEIR ENERGY THROUGH EDISON. OF THESE CARE CUSTOMERS ONLY 4% PARTICIPATED IN THEM. MEANING OVER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CARE CUSTOMERS WERE LOW INCOME FAMILIES. OR ABOUT NINETY SIX PERCENT. SHOULDER THE ADDITIONAL COST BURDEN BURDEN FROM ALL NON CUSTOMERS. THIS IS IN YOUR REPORT. AND IT'S TAKEN THE P. YOU SEE YEARS. YEARS AND YEARS. TO DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THE COST SHIFT. I'D LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU DIRECTLY. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE. TO A LOW INCOME FAMILY THAT'S A CARE CUSTOMER. THAT'S HAVING TO PAY THE COST OF THE COST SHIFT AND THE DIFFERENCE. FROM THE MORE AFFLUENT. CUSTOMERS THAT ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE BENEFIT FROM THEM WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING. TO COMPARE LEADER FOR THE RENT. PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND WE AND ACTUALLY WILL BENEFIT FROM THE PC AT ADDRESSING. THIS BURDEN OF THE COST SHIFT THAT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THOSE LOW INCOME FAMILIES AS TO WHY. THE PC HAS FAILED TO ACT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD SAY THAT I'M IS DISHEARTENED AS YOU ARE- AND WE HAVE A AS I SPOKE EARLIER SKEWS ME. WE HAVE A PROCEEDING. THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY THAT WILL- THAT IS LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE COST SHIFT VERY CLOSELY AT THE ISSUE THAT YOU JUST VERY WELL DESCRIBED- I WOULD SAY THE INEQUITY OR THE UNFAIRNESS. OF THE CURRENT STRUCTURE- THAT THE INTERNET ENERGY METERING- HAS IN ITS IN ITS CURTAIN CURRENT FORM THAT PROCEEDING WILL BE CONCLUDING AT THE END OF THIS YEAR AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND INDYCAR SHIFT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PROCEEDING THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER BUT I WHAT I'M MISSING IS THE COMPASSION. WHAT I'M MISSING IS THE FACT THAT IT'S- THIS COULD HAVE BEEN FIXED YEARS AGO AND IT STILL HASN'T. AND IT IT WEIGHS HEAVILY ON CARE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ALREADY INCREDIBLY AT. HURTING AND OUR PAVON TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS MORE AFFLUENT WHO IS NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE INTO THE GRID. WELL I APOLOGIZE IF I DO NOT SEEN AND COMPASSIONATE. AND THAT I DON'T HAVE THAT I'M NOT SHOWING ON THE NEEDED PASSION I THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS. BUT A TEST TO. BOTH MY PASSION AND THERE IS- IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT ELECTRICITY IS SAFE AND RELIABLE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE. AND AS I SAID WE ARE. CURRENTLY ADDRESSING GOING TO BE ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE I CAN'T UNDER UNDER RULES AND REGULATIONS TELL YOU THAT IT'S MOST DEFINITELY THIS IS THE DECISION OF THE PROCEEDING- I WOULD BE GETTING OUT AHEAD OF THE VOTES OF MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS BUT- COST SHIFT HAS BEEN ANALYZED YOU YOU- WELL RECITED FROM A REPORT. THERE'S OTHER MODELING THAT WE HAVE BEEN NOT DONE WE WILL BE TAKING FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE THIS EXTREMELY INFORMING TO US AND WE WILL BE MAKING A DECISION AT THE END OF THE YEAR. AND I DO CARE DEEPLY FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND ALL AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED AND IN LOW INCOME AREAS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE WE HAVE INCREASED THIS YEAR SADLY BECAUSE A PANDEMIC MOSTLY BELIEVE INCLUDE INCREASE THE CUSTOMERS THAT- SUBSCRIBE TO CARE. AND FARAH- AND- I'M I THINK THAT IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND I KNOW THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE STRUGGLING STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR ELECTRICITY BILLS. AND THIS THE MORE EFFICIENCY THAT WE CAN BRING TO THE ELECTRIC GRID AND THE MORE WE CAN. DO THAT WILL BRING- OUR RATES DOWN AND THE MORE WE CAN DO THAT BRINGS- GREATER EFFICIENCY IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TO OUR ENVIRONMENT- GREATER EFFECTIVENESS I SHOULD SAY. IS BETTER FOR EVERYONE PARTICULARLY THOSE FOLKS THAT DO LIVE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND- ARE ON MORE SUBJECT TO SOME OF THE POLLUTANTS AND SOME OF THE OTHER- DIFFICULTIES THAT COME FROM ON INDUSTRIAL WASTE IF YOU WILL. I WANT TO JUST- A CLARIFYING QUESTION BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MISINFORMATION BEING SHARED. ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH RELATES RELATING TO A PARTICULAR BILL OTHER WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY HOUSE AND WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT IS REGARDING RATES CAN YOU PLEASE CLARIFY ON THE RECORD WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY RATES. IS THAT THE UTILITIES THEMSELVES OR IS IT THE TO UC. THIS ABUSING SO WHEN WE SEE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES REYES REPAIR- REYES RAISE THE RED THE RATES ON ON UTILITIES THAT'S BECAUSE THE PC HAS NOT ACT ACTED IS THAT ACCURATE. RELATED TO NINETY EIGHT RELATED TO MAKE SHIFTING COSTS. I'M SORRY- IF I MAY JUST GREAT TOO LITTLE BED- THE RATE RATES- THAT ARE INCREASED BY THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY THE FUSEE. CORRECT SO THAT MEANS THAT THE P. U. C. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EITHER ACTING OR NOT ACTING ON THE COST SHIFT. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE YES SO JUST FOR THE RECORD THE PC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CAUTIOUS AND NOT THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES CORRECT. AS IT COMES AS IT THREE AS AS YOU'RE REFERRING TO- NET ENERGY METERING YES. I THINK THAT WOULD BE ACCURATE NO WAY YOU LAID IT OUT. IS THAT IN MY IN MY CORRECT. ADDRESS YES THANK YOU. OKAY I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT ON RECORD BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION AS TO WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COST SHIFT WHETHER IT'S THE UTILITIES THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THEMSELVES OR WHETHER IT'S THE P. YOU SEE IN BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN. A FAILURE TO ACT FOR THE ON THE NET ENERGY METERING IN THE COSTA FOR MANY YEARS NOW THERE SEEMS TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET TO A BETTER PLACE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR WHICH IS WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER- AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT BECAUSE AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. MY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN EAST LOS ANGELES WHO ARE ALREADY 20% BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE. SHOULD HAVE TO. CARRY THE BURDEN OF HAVING TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE. FOR A MORE AFFLUENT COMMUNITY RIGHT NEXT DOOR. YES THANK YOU. OKAY I WANT ONE JUST FINAL QUESTION A NIGHT I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND CONSIDERATION BUT IS IT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PUSH LEGISLATION TO MAKE THE P. YOU SEE OCT OR SHOULD THE P. YOU SEE ACT BE DOING ITS JOB AND- MOVING FORWARD WITH WHAT'S NEEDED. WELL I'M THE LEGISLATURE IS A SEPARATE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PASS LAWS THAT INSTRUCT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. HOW TO DO THEIR JOB SO I WOULD NEVER QUESTION THE AUTHORITY OR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT. WE OF THE PC OR ANY OTHER STATE AGENCY THAT I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO OPERATE IN A VERY EFFECTIVE- MANNER AND TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE THEY ARE. RESPONSIBLE FOR AND THAT'S IN OUR CASE IT'S THE RATEPAYERS AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE SHOULD ALWAYS ACT ON BEHALF OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU- PRESIDENT DODGER REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER BECAUSE- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATION THAT WE WERE MOVING- MOST RECENTLY HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY IS ACTUALLY LEGISLATION THAT WAS NEEDED HAD THE PC ACTED ACCORDINGLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS NOW I RECOGNIZE. THAT UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THAT UP BUT IT REALLY DOES BEG THE QUESTION THAT IF THERE IS RESPECT FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PC HAS NOT ACTED ON THE LEGISLATION PASSED TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THE COST SHIFT RELATED TO THE NET ENERGY METERING THEN WE'RE GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES IN TERMS OF PASSING LEGISLATION THAT'S IMPORTANT YEARS AND YEARS WHERE THERE IS NO ACTION. AND NOW HERE WE ARE WITH YOUR OWN REPORT THAT CAME OUT IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR INDICATING A REAL INEQUITY ISSUE RELATED TO SOLAR AND RELATED TO NET ENERGY METERING AND RELATED TO UTILITIES OVERALL SO AGAIN I KNOW THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON AND HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR WE HAVE A RESOLUTION BUT JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OF US THAT ARE LOOKING AT CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE GRID- THE REALITY OF. A REACHING 1100% RENEWABLES BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND OTHER GOALS THAT WE HAVE PUT UPON THE STATE THAT I BELIEVE IN. BUT BY DOING SO WE ALSO NEED THE P. YOU SEE TO ACT AND TO ALSO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE DON'T PUT THE BURDENS ON LOW INCOME FAMILY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T OWN THE ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. RENTERS ALSO NEED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THE CLIMATE SOLUTION- AND IT SHOULDN'T BE ON THE BURKE ON THE BACKS OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU HEAR ME LOUD AND CLEAR BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE ABOUT EQUITY. AND ENSURING THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION. VERSES THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING NOW AND THEN WE'VE BEEN HAVING SINCE I MET YOU IN TWENTY NINETEEN. I HEAR YOU VERY LOUD AND CLEAR. AND I RESPECT YOU. AS DO MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT VERY HELPFUL. AND CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. THANK YOU I'M GOOD MISTER CHAIR. DR KIRK- WELL THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH I THINK THE PRESIDENT OF- THE P. YOU SEE HAS ONE OF THE MOST THANKLESS JOBS IN THE- IN THE STATE. I KNOW IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT JOB AND I'LL BE ASKING YOU QUESTIONS TO AND- I THINK YOUR RESPONSE TODAY TO OUR QUESTIONS HAS BEEN QUITE RESPONSIVE AND I APPRECIATED. AND I APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTY OF THE JOB THAT YOU HAVE TO DO. ONE OF THE MAIN SEE ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS I'VE HAD AS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE AND I HAVE BEEN ASKING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. IS WHY ARE WE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER STATES. WE TEND TO GET FAIRLY VAGUE ANSWERS. ARM I'M GOING TO BE SENDING YOU A LETTER- WHICH WILL DESCRIBE. A WAY TO MAKE THIS LESS- LAST DAY IN PARTICULAR THERE'S A BILL THEIR KEYS ME THERE'S A- LET EXCUSE ME A PAPER THAT'S WRITTEN. BY THE HARSH SHE'S ME HAAS ENERGY INSTITUTE AT UC BERKELEY- BY BARGE DEAN VALLEY AND SOLLY- WHICH COULD HAS A METHODOLOGY OF. TAKING THE FIXED COSTS. TAKING THE VARIABLE COSTS SEPARATING THOSE OUT SEPARATELY IN A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES IN PARTICULAR LOOKING AT. OUR GENERATION SO THERE'S SOME FIXED COSTS ARE LIKE THE ABOVE MARKET RATES THAT WE PAY TO INITIALLY GET SOLAR STARTED- THEN THERE'S THE COST OF ACTUALLY GENERATING THE ENERGY. THERE'S FIXED COSTS FOR TRANSMISSION AS WELL AS VARIABLE COSTS. MOSTLY FIXED COST FOR DISTRIBUTION BUT SOME VARIABLE COST. SOME COST DUE TO POLLUTION WHICH IS SOCIAL COST AND THEN SOMETHING WHICH IS ACTUALLY LARGER THAN TRANSMISSION. WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU'VE JUST BEEN ASKED ABOUT WHICH IS THE SUBSIDY FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR IT'S ACTUALLY LARGER THAN LEAST ON THIS GRAPH IF I LOOK AT IT IT LOOKS TO BE LARGER THAN THE COST OF TRANSMISSION. BOB AT ANY RATE IF YOU COULD AND AGAIN I'LL PUT THIS IN A LETTER. IF YOU COULD- TELL US HOW THESE VARIOUS COST COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. SO WE CAN SEE OF THE NEARLY DOUBLE THE NATIONAL RATE. HOW MUCH OF THAT IS DUE TO OUR COST OF DISTRIBUTION AND GENERATION. HOW MUCH OF IT IS DUE TO- ENERGY PROGRAMS LIKE- ENERGY CONSERVATION WHICH YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. AS WELL AS- ROOFTOP SOLAR. SO IF YOU THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA AGAIN I WILL SEND YOU A LETTER ALONG WITH THE REFERENCE TO THIS PAPER AND IF YOU COULD JUST COMPARE AVERAGE US COSTS FOR THESE VARIOUS- PARTS OF THE- PUZZLE HERE WE CAN GET A BETTER IDEA OF WIRE COSTS ARE SO HIGH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I'M ON TEN MILLION WITH THE PAPER I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME- DR BORENSTEIN HAS INDEED TESTIFIED IN ONE OF OUR- PUBLIC HEARINGS. ON THE PAPER AND ON SOME OF THE THEORY THAT THAT HE HAS PUT FORTH- ONE OF THE A COUPLE OF COSTS WHEN YOU DID MENTION OF AND ONE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER DRIVER OF THE UTILITY COSTS AND RATE DRIVERS. ONE IS OF COURSE- YOU YOU SPOKE- ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION COSTS TRANSMISSION COSTS- ARE REALLY ESCALATING QUITE HEAVILY- AND ALSO OUR WELFARE MITIGATION COSTS. YES BOTH THE- BOTH THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT COSTS AND THEN OF COURSE THE HARDENING. OF THE SYSTEMS IN OUR IOUS IT'S COSTLY AND- THOSE ARE TWO. PRETTY STRONG RIGHT DRIVERS RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA ASK- AND I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE DETAILS OF OTHER STATES I DON'T KNOW THAT MISTER RANDOLPH WELL EITHER THE COMPARISONS BUT HE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA THAN I DO A MORE THOROUGH IDEA YEAH LET ME JUST TAKE THAT OUR RATES WERE ALREADY TWICE AS HIGH BEFORE WE WERE PUTTING ALL THIS MONEY INTO WILDFIRE. BUT ANYWAY GO AHEAD MISTER RANDALL. YEAH THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK- IN MINUTES ACTUALLYAND- EXCELLENT ANALYSIS- ANALYTICAL SUGGESTION- YEAH I'LL NOTE THAT WE ALREADY DO- PROVIDED ANNUAL SUMMARY OF EACH OF THE CATEGORIES IT YEAH- YOU HAVE OUTLINED. YOU KNOW WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S A STARTING POINT IN THE AND I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT WHAT WE DETERMINES THE AB SIXTY SEVEN REPORT- WHICH DOES DETAIL- YOU KNOW BOTH THE- AMOUNT ON EACH YEAR- EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES YOU'VE OUTLINED- PLUS NOW THAT THE AB SIXTY SEVEN REPORT HAS BEEN LAID OUT IN THAT DETAIL- FOR. CLOSE TO FIFTEEN YEARS NOW YOU CAN ALSO SEE THOSE LONG TERM TRENDS IN THOSE DETAILS- IT IT IS A GOOD QUESTION TO LOOK AT NEAR THE NATIONAL TRENDS IN EACH ONE- AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT. YOU KNOW JUST CAUTION- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DATA IS IN EACH STATE AND YOU KNOW WE WOULD TYPICALLY FOR THAT ANALYSIS TURN TO- THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY- TO MAKE THOSE COMPARISONS WHICH WE CAN TRY- YOU KNOW HER ADDITIONALLY- NOT TO PUT IT BACK IN THE HOSPITAL BUSINESS- YOU KNOW WE WOULD ALSO PROBABLY REACH OUT TO MR BORENSTEIN AND OTHERS- TO WORK WITH THEM ON THAT SAME ANALYSIS. HI WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU AND ANYTHING YOU KNOW I'LL BE GLAD TO TALK WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES. IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD IF YOU WANT TO GET SOME HELP FROM THEM I'D BE GLAD TO TALK TO THEM AS WELL. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR LETTER AND OF COURSE RESEARCH INTO RESPONDING. IN A TIMELY MANNER I MIGHT ADD. ALL RIGHT- SO WE HAVE DISCUSSED- SO SOMETHING THAT CAME UP WHEN THE ISO WAS HERE FOR AND YOU WERE HERE AS WELL FOR AN EARLIER DISCUSSION AS WELL AS THE ENERGY COMMISSION. THERE WAS A BIT TOO MUCH GOING ON FOR MY TO DIG INTO IT TOO MUCH- BUT I'VE TALKED WITH COMMISSIONER- CLIFF. RIGHT RACETRACK SHAMAN WRECK SHAMAN SHAMAN RUSSIA OFTEN. OF AND HE IS- CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE DO DURING THE WINTER ARE WHEN WE'VE GONE OVER TO WHAT WILL PROBABLY BE LARGELY SOLAR AND WIND SOME GEOTHERMAL- THE PROBLEM IS WIND AND SOLAR. ARE NOT COMPLEMENTARY DURING THE WINTER OFFSHORE WIND GOES DOWN WITH SOLAR GOES DOWN IN THE WINTER- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT LAND WIND BUT THAT'S NOT TERRIBLY RELIABLE HERE IN THE STATE- AND WE CAN GET SOME SORT OF BALANCE PARTICULARLY WERE WILLING TO IMPORT SAY WYOMING WIND- IF THEY HAVE MORE DURING THE WINTER. THEN THEY CAN USE- ALSO- IMPORTING HYDRO FROM THE PACIFIC BUT I THINK WE NEED TO JUST LOOK AT THIS IN IN MORE DETAIL. I HAVE SEEN. OUR ESTIMATES OF THE IMBALANCE BY JACK BRAUER OF UC- IRVINE- WHO SHOWS A LARGE. COMMISSIONER CLIFF IS LOOKING INTO THIS- BUT I'M JUST ASKING THAT YOU TAKE A VERY HARD LOOK AT THIS SO WE'RE NOT PLAYING CATCH UP IN. TWENTY THIRTY BECAUSE FRANKLY IT TAKES. DECADES TO GET NEW SOURCES ONLINE- PUMPED STORAGE IS NOT GOING TO BE ADEQUATE OVER THIS TIME SCALE BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO LARGE AN AMOUNT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH WATER- IT'S GOOD FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS PERHAPS FORTY EIGHT HOURS PERHAPS. EVEN A COUPLE OF DAYS BUT THAT'S NOT A GOOD FOR ALL SCHOOLS AND- SO IT REALLY MEANS BRINGING UP. WHOLE NEW METHODS- JACK BRAUER WHO I MENTIONED- LIKES HYDROGEN STORAGE. THERE CAN BE MANY OTHERS BUT THE ANSWER I'VE GOTTEN AGAIN IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN FAIRLY- VAGUE. AND I JUST LIKE- YOU TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT YOU CONSIDER THIS QUESTION IS AND WHAT MIGHT YOU DO TO LOOK INTO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A RECORD OF YES QUICK RECORD SHOP AND- IT IS- THE COMMISSIONER WHO CURRENTLY HAS THE PRECEDING THE- THE I. R. P. DECISION- THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER AND AS I ALSO MENTIONED EARLIER WE WILL BE VOTING ON THAT- DECISION AT THE END OF THE MONTH. AND IN THAT DECISION IN THE PROPOSED TO SKIP DECISION SKEWS ME- THERE ARE SEVERAL ELIGIBLE RESOURCES- THAT ARE ARE BEING CALLED UPON AND CALLED OUT BY- BY THE DECISION AND PROPOSED DECISION AND THAT INCLUDES THE GREEN HYDROGEN. AND THERE WILL BE A FINER DEFINITIONS I BELIEVE AND- PUMP STORAGE OR LONG TERM STORAGE SKEWS ME AND- THE OTHER RESOURCES THAT- YOU MENTIONED. SO I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT WE AS A COMMISSION ARE THE COMMISSIONERS MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY IMBALANCE AND- WE- WE ALSO AS YOU MENTIONED- WE DO. CAN AND DO IMPORT WIND- AT WHEN THAT IS AVAILABLE DURING DURING THE WINTER SO- ALL OF THESE RESOURCES I'M EXCITED ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGY I'M EXCITED ABOUT BRINGING THE MON OPENING THAT DOOR VERY EXCITED THAT WE HAVE A- COMPANION IN DOING THIS AND NOW WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- IN NEED BY NEED MINISTRATION. SO IN TERMS OF OFFSHORE WIND THAT'S- THANKFULLY WE THE GOVERNOR HAS WORKED HARD TO- WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT. OF DEFENSE AND WE NOW WILL HAVE SOME- I'M SURE LEASES THAT CAN BE. CALLED UPON IN IN OUR HARD WORK IN THE YEARS AHEAD I LIKE YOU HOPE THAT ALL OF THESE RESOURCES THAT WE'VE BEEN WE MENTIONED AND WILL BE ARE MENTIONED IN THE PROPOSED DECISION WILL BE MENTIONED IN OTHER PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE P. YOU SEE. ARE WELL UNDER WAY- AND WE'RE CALLING FOR MANY OF THEM TO BE WELL UNDERWAY BEFORE WELL BEFORE TWENTY THIRTY. AND WE'RE DOING THAT IN SEVERAL PROCEEDINGS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY AND WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW. IS THE- INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING DECISION. YES OF THAT DECISION IS GOING TO PRIMARILY DEAL WITH LONG TERM MEANING MORE THAN ABOUT FOUR HOURS- DEALING WITH SORT OF THE DAY TIME SCALE AS OPPOSED TO SEASONAL TIME SCALES. AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE BACKGROUND WORK SIMPLY TO SKETCH OUT HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS AGAIN OFFSHORE WIND GOES DOWN IN THE WINTER NOT UP ALL RIGHT AND THE- THE QUESTION THEN IS HOW SORT OF BACK OF THE ENVELOPE ALMOST BUT HOW BIG IS THE PROBLEM AND SORT OF WHAT TECHNOLOGIES. ARM ARE OUT THERE TO SOLVE IT AND- BASICALLY I'D LIKE TO SAY. IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO TO TAKE A LOOK AT PROPOSING SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES IT'S NOT SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE HAS OF COURSE THE EXPERTISE TO SAY. YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD DO THIS WITH HYDROGEN STORAGE WE SHOULD DO IT WITH FLOW BATTERIES OR- IMPORTING WIT WIND AND- HYDRO FROM OTHER PLACES WE DON'T HAVE THAT THAT WE DEPEND UPON YOU. SO I'M JUST ASKING THAT- FOR SUPPORT OF FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN. GETTING SORT OF A SKELETAL OUTLINE OF WHERE WE MIGHT GO- SAID THAT- YOU CAN INFORM US AND OTHER DECISION MAKERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS TO YOU KNOW WHAT WE THINK THE NEED MIGHT BE. AGAIN WE GET ENTHUSIASTS LIKE JACK BRAUER FROM UC- IRVINE AND HE HAS HIS VIEWPOINT ON HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE- BUT I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE THE EXPERTISE OF THE P. YOU SEE- LOOKING AT THIS BECAUSE FRANKLY HE'S- THERE MAY BE OTHER ESTIMATES OUT THERE BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF THEM. I WILL ENTHUSIASTICALLY. LOOK AT IT- ACT INFORMING ON YOU AND YOUR FELLOW AND- MEMBERS IN IN LOOKING AT THE IMBALANCE WE WILL BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THIS WITH A MORE THOROUGH ANALYSIS. AND I'M AND WE WILL BUILD OFF OF THE DISCUSSIONS YOU HAVE HAD WITH COMMISSIONER REX SHAMAN. OKAY WELL AGAIN I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE COMMISSIONERS- RESPONSIVENESS AND JUST WANT TO ASK FOR YOUR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT- AND- THAT THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS IT'S BEEN VERY PLEASANT TALKING TO YOU ALL AGAIN. AGAIN I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A VERY DIFFICULT JOB AND THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO DO IT. I'LL THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS CHALLENGING- IT'S VERY CHALLENGING BUT THERE'S A TERRIFIC STAFF HERE AT THE C. P. YOU SEE. THAT I HEAVILY DEPEND ON AND I AM VERY LUCKY TO HAVE SOME VERY SMART WISE AND- AND COMMITTED- FELLOW COMMISSIONERS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I JUST WANTED TO ASK ONE QUESTION I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WERE SEEKING TO BE RECOGNIZED BUT ALL THIS WOULD BE MY LAST QUESTION THEN WILL TURN OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR YOU PRESS ABOUT HER AND ALSO FOR. OUR ACTING DIRECTOR YEP KAMALA. I HOPE SHE'S STILL HERE WITH THIS- BUT THIS IS REGARDING THE RECENT. WE RECENTLY HEARD IN THE NEWS ABOUT. THE CCA IN RIVERSIDE FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY- EARLIER THIS MONTH THIS RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT THE STABILITY. OF OUR ELECTRIC SECTOR AND SHOULD WE BE WORRIED MORE BANKRUPTCIES ARE IN THE FUTURE. HOW HAVE YOUR AGENCIES INCREASE MONITORING OF THE STABILITY OF OUR ENERGY INSTITUTIONS TO ENSURE. BANKRUPTCIES WAS AN ISOLATED THIS PARTICULAR BANKRUPTCY WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. AND WHAT DOES THIS BANKRUPTCY MEAN FOR THE CCA CUSTOMERS AND THE CUSTOMERS OF EDISON. HOW WILL THEY BE PROTECTED. I WILL I THINK SPEAK FIRST IF THAT'S OKAY WITH AMY- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING OF THE WESTERN CLEAN ENERGY DESERTIFICATION IN BANKRUPTCY AND WE DO- KEEP CLOSE. TABS IF YOU WILL ON THE HEALTH OF THE CCA'S WE DO NOT FULLY REGULATE THE CCA'S AS I KNOW YOU'RE FULLY AWARE- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH ADDISON- BECAUSE THAT THE CUSTOMERS AT WCVE WILL BE RETURNED TO- TO ADDISON. AND- SO- THAT ACTUALLY WE'VE ALREADY- TAKE AN ACTION- ON ON ON THAT TO SOME DEGREE BUT AND YET IS BEEN ADMIN OFFICE BEEN DEEP IN VAULT OUR MOST ON A DAILY BASIS IN TRACKING- THE DECERTIFICATION BANKRUPTCY SO I WANT TO ADD TO GIVE AS MANY DETAILS AS HE HAS- THANK YOU PRESIDENT THAT'S WE ALL JUST REAL QUICKLY WALK THROUGH- THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE THERE WITH THAT PARTICULAR EVENT- SO- WESTERN CLEAN ENERGY'S CUSTOMERS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING RETURNED TO. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON BUNDLED SERVICE NOW SO THEY'LL BE BUT- DISTRIBUTION AND GENERATION CUSTOMERS- IN IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES ANY RETURN OF CUSTOMERS ARE NOT RESOLVED AND- EIGHT IN. ARE RATE IMPACTS FOR THE- EXISTING CUSTOMERS THERE'S A PROCESS WHERE ALTERNATELY THE RETURNING CUSTOMERS WILL PAY- A SURCHARGE THAT COVERS- THE COST OF THE INCREMENTAL COST OF SERVING THEM FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS- SOME OF THAT INCREMENTAL COSTS DOES GET COVERED BY- A LETTER OF CREDIT EACH W. R. EACH CCA IS REQUIRED TO HAVE- UNFORTUNATELY THOSE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED TO THE COST OF RETURNING CUSTOMERS OR SOME OF THAT. WILL BE BORNE BY THE RETURNING CUSTOMERS BASED ON CURRENT ESTIMATES AND THIS COULD CHANGE- SINCE SOME OF THIS IS BASED ON FORWARD ENERGY PRICES- AND THOSE WILL OFTEN THERE'S A RAPIDLY CHANGING RIGHT NOW- ABOUT 40% OF W. C. ECONOMY IS ACTUALLY WILL SEE A SLIGHT RATE DECREASE. WHEN THEY RETURN TO ADDISON SERVICE ON THOSE ARE THE- CARE AND FAIR CUSTOMERS TO LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS- AND THEN THE REMAINING 60% THE NON LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS WILL LIKELY SEE BETWEEN A POINT EIGHT CENT AND A PENNY INCREASE ARM AND RATES THAT AVERAGES OUT TO ABOUT TEN DOLLARS. A MONTH SO NOT INSIGNIFICANT- RATE CHANGE FOR ABOUT 60% OF THE CUSTOMERS- YEAH I DO WANT TO BUILD ON SOMETHING PRESENT BACHELOR SAID ON IN TERMS OF MONITORING THE HEALTH OF THE ENTITIES- WE DO VERY CLOSELY MONITOR HEALTH OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES- AND HAVE- QUARTERLY MEETINGS WITH THEM- WORKING THROUGH- THEIR- THEIR FINANCES THEIR RATINGS- THERE TO MONITOR THEIR HEALTH AND I HAVE- SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IN CASE WE NEED TO GET INVOLVED IN SOMETHING- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME REGULATORY JURISDICTION OVER THE CCA'S- WE DON'T HAVE SIMILAR MEETINGS WITH THEM- IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE- ONE STUDY SEE. I DECLARED FOR BANKRUPTCY WE DID START HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH CAL CCA- TO GET INFORMATION THROUGH THEM ON- WHAT THE STATE OF FINANCE THIS. FOR C. INTO- WE HAVE THE DIRECT INFORMATION BUT WE DID GET INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THAT- OR TO TRY TO HAVE SOME ASSURANCES THAT THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A CHAIN REACTION- AMONG OTHER CCA'S- OVER THE SUMMER BASED ON PEOPLE GETTING NERVOUS ABOUT THE OVERALL FINANCIAL MODEL WE DON'T. THANK THAT'S A RISK BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR- AND WE DO THINK THAT THE SITUATION WOULD W. C. E. R. IS FAIRLY UNIQUE. ARE GIVEN- THEY'RE BASICALLY STARTED SERVING CUSTOMERS AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC- THAT THEY HAVE A- A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH NUMBER OF LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS. AND ADD TO PERSONALLY HIGH NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO WERE UNABLE TO PAY THEIR ELECTRIC BILLS DURING THE UP ENERGY KERR DURING THE PANDEMIC. NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK CLEARLY WE'RE GOING TO. NO SEE THIS HOPEFULLY JUST AS A RARE OCCURRENCE A RARE EVENT AND I BELIEVE THAT THE STABILITY OF CCA'S IS SORT OF. FUNDAMENTAL AND THE THEIR DECISION MAKING IS. POSITIONING THEM FOR SUCCESS DOWN THE ROAD BUT I L. COULD ALSO. SIGNAL THAT THERE'S SOME DEFICIENCY AND HOW OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE OF THE FINANCES ARE STRUCTURED AND HOW THE LONG TERM VIABILITY COULD BE JEOPARDIZED IF. THERE SOMETHING MORE SYSTEMIC AT PLAY AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO OBVIOUSLY HAVE. OUR CONVERSATIONS HEALTHY CONVERSATIONS WITH- CCA'S AND UNDERSTAND- THEIR THOUGHTS AND- BUT BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT DID HAPPEN ON THE SERVER SIDE UP COMING. AND WE THINK WE NEED TO- PAY ATTENTION SO I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR INSIGHT ON THAT AND CERTAINLY AN ADDITIONAL. BUT YOU CAN GIVE US AND WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THE I. O. U.'S AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AS WELL. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO- PROVIDING PUBLIC COMMENT THIS IS A PART OF THE HEARING WILL TURN TO. THE PUBLIC THERE'S NO ONE HERE IN THE GALLERY AND OR IN THE BACK OF THE CHAMBER- TO BE RECOGNIZED AND SO WE WILL TURN TO OUR- VIDEO. VIA THE TELECONFERENCING SERVICE. AND WILL ASK OUR MODERATOR TO CHECK TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO IS PREPARED TO. ADDRESS THIS- HEARING- FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE ARE ASKED THAT THE TESTIMONY OR ANY COMMENTS BE LIMITED TO ONE MINUTE.
