THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] WELCOME SIR [inaudible] ONE ONE YOUR FAMILY OR OKAY. THE RIGHT THERE [inaudible] YEAH. ARE YOU TWO MINUTES. FIVE MORTAR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LAURIE CAMP I AM A REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORSTER AND A SMALL LAND OWNER -- IT WITH PROPERTY IN THAT ACCOUNT -- I'M HERE TODAY I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE WAS REMEMBER THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE IN CURRENTLY SIR ON THE FORESTALL FORCE MANAGEMENT -- TASK FORCES ARE VOLUNTEERS SO I'VE BEEN INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH THE DECISIONS -- FOR FOUR YEARS OR MORE NOW I'M HERE TODAY. ON BEHALF OF FORCE LANDOWNERS OF CALIFORNIA IT'S A STATEWIDE GROUP OF NON INDUSTRIAL LAND OWNERS -- WE MANAGE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF NINE GOSH YOU'RE TIMBERLANDS ACROSS THE STATE IN ALL REGIONS -- WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IS JUST CURRY WRITTEN WITH RESPECT TO THE FORESTRY PROVISIONS -- I'D LIKE -- TO OFFER A COUPLE OF COMMENTS IF I MAY. ONE WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL VIOLATES THE SPIRIT OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS ISSUED BY BOTH GOVERNOR BROWN AND GOVERNOR NEWSOME WITH RESPECT -- TO FOREST HEALTH AND FORCE MANAGEMENT -- WE YOU KNOW CURRENT LAW. PROHIBITS A TIMBER HARVESTING PLAN FROM BEING APPROVED SO THIS IS A DUPLICATE OF PROCESS -- IN TERMS OF THE REVIEW TEAMS WHICH INCLUDES -- MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA VISION GAME COMMISSION I'M SORRY -- FISH AND GAME DEPARTMENT -- CAL FIRE WHO IN I GUESS I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON ON THE COST OF POTENTIAL COST TO THIS BILL. I FOUND A STEADY. GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND THREE THAT INDICATED THAT IF WE DID ALL OF THE STREAM EVERITT AT RESTORATION INCLUDING ROADS AND OTHER THINGS WE WOULD SPEND THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S A BEAT WITH A BILLION -- TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM OF DEALING WITH -- THEM -- PAST OUR PRACTICES -- BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT -- YOU KNOW -- THE PLAY INTO THE ROLE OF SALMON PROTECTION THESE INCLUDE WATER DIVISIONS ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS -- THE YOU KNOW FOR OCEAN CONDITIONS AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND SIX THERE WERE. SOME. MAJOR ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH -- SALMON POPULATION DECLINE RELATED OCEAN CONDITIONS. CLIMATE IS -- CERTAINLY AN ISSUE AND FINALLY I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE FOR FRACTURES RULES HAVE CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY -- BEGINNING IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. LOOTING -- THE APPROVAL OF THE IS P. OR OUR AND THE UNDER BE SALMON RLES IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THOSE ARE IN EFFECT NOW THEY ALSO. INCLUDE THE WERE REVISED RULES WHICH HYDROLOGICALLY DISCONNECT OR OUR PROPERTIES WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK -- FOR DROPPING THE PROVISIONS OF OF THE FORESTRY PROVISIONS IN THE BILL OR ALTERNATIVELY -- ON OVER THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. TWO MINUTES IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. COMMITTEE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME'S HARLAN TREMOR ON THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA LICENSE FORSTER'S ASSOCIATION BOB. ALSO KNOWN AS C. L. FAA SHE'LL SAY. THE GOALS OF THE SB SIX NINE BUT WE OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE REFILL WOULD SEVERELY DISRUPT A REGULATORY PROCESS.% THAT IS CURRENTLY MOVING AHEAD WITH THE LEVEL OF CONSENSUS THAT WE DON'T OFTEN SEE. AND ALSO -- WITH THE URGENCY PLACED ON US BY SOCIETY. REQUIRING REGIONAL BOARDS TO MAKE FINDINGS THAT EACH PLAN -- WOULD BE WITHOUT SENTIMENT IMPACT. WOULD CREATE A BOTTLENECK IN THE SYSTEM. AS WATER BOARD TO BE RELUCTANT TO MAKE SUCH FINDINGS EVEN IF THEY AND THE OTHER REVIEW TEAM MEMBERS -- I AGREE WITH THAT. THE OTHER MEMBERS THE REVIEW TEAM INCLUDE. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE. THE CALIFORNIA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY SOMETIMES COUNTIES. AND OTHER AGENCIES. THE LANDSCAPES OF THE AND WATER WAYS ARE SLOW TO RECOVER FROM THE LEGACY DAMAGE. WELL WHEN THE MITIGATION SEND REPAIRS AND UPGRADES ARE IMPLEMENTED THE RESPONSES SLOW CURRENT DOWNSTREAM CONDITIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE. OF CURRENT PRACTICES. THEY SHOULD BE MONITORED. BUT THEY NEED THE RESULTS IN TO BE LOOKED AT IN A LARGE TEMPORAL SCALE. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS BILLS REQUIREMENTS. THAT OPERATIONS DOES NOT RESULT IN ANY DISCHARGE THE COMMITTEE HAS RECOGNIZED AND MAYBE THE AUTHORS HAVE. TO THAT OPERATIONS. UNDER SUCH RULES. SUCH A STREAM CROSSING UPGRADES WITH MINIMAL DISCHARGE SHOULD NOT BE PROHIBITED. WE WOULD TAKE THAT ONE STEP FURTHER. EVERY SITUATION IS DIFFERENT. FORRESTER'S NEED. IN THE REVIEW TEAMS NEED THE FLEXIBILITY. TO CONSIDER THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL SITUATION. REGARDING THE SPECIFIC RULE CHANGES THAT ARE PROPOSES IS TYPICALLY DONE WITH EXPERT INPUT RESEARCH AND BAY WHICH RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF FORESTRY WHICH THEN. THE ENTERS INTO A PUBLICLY TRANSPARENT. PROCESS. LEGISLATION IS NOT THE WAY TO REQUIRE. TO SAID CANNOT BE A COVER REQUIREMENTS AND STREAM BUFFER DISTANCES. WAS GONNA ASK YOU TO WRAP UP WITH OKAY THANK IN WRAPPING UP -- THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PROCESS IS NOT ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS -- AT A TIME WHEN TWO CONSECUTIVE GOVERNORS HAVE CALLED FOR AN INCREASE IN FUEL TREATMENT THIS WOULD RESULT IN LESS FEEL TREATMENT BECAUSE THE WATER BOARD. IS NOT EQUIPPED. TO OVERSEE. THE TO MARTHA'S PLAN REVIEW PROCESS UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR AND I KNOW THERE'S AN AMENDMENT SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE I RECOGNIZE YOU. KNOW MAY STILL OF OUTSTANDING CONCERNS IF THOSE OF YOU'VE READ THE ANALYSIS BE. THE AUTHORS TAKING THE AMENDS AND SO JUST COMMENTARY FOCUS ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF WHERE WE WANT TO DO OUR WORK ON FORD. BUT I WELCOME ANY. FURTHER OPPOSITION COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THE MORNING I'M JENNIFER PAIR THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS WE REPRESENT TWENTY SEVEN PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- ON BEHALF OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT TIME WE APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMITTEE WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THE ISSUES ALREADY SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WE DID MEET WITH THE PRODUCT PROPONENTS AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE-A LOT OF ALIGNED OBJECTIVES HERE BUT TE CONCERN REGARDING THE NET PEN. STUDY AND SOME OF THE THE COATED WIRE TAX STUDIES IS THAT -- WE IT'S NOT CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE SCIENCE IS ACTUALLY BEING PROPOSED IN THE BILL AND WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH. LEGISLATING THIS SORT OF SCIENCE AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT COLLABORATIVE IN OTHER EFFORT SO VERY HAPPY TO KEEP WORKING TOWARDS THESE OBJECTIVES BUT NOT I'M A FAN OF IT IN THE LEGISLATION I THINK IT WAS. TO THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING NO -- CREAMERS OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION IN THE ANALYSIS HOWEVER DOESN'T THOSE AMENDMENTS WOULD NOT GO FAR ENOUGH TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. WE'RE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH -- WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN SHOWN -- THE SCIENCE TO BACK UP THAT THIS WOULD SOLVE A PROBLEM AND WITHOUT THAT WE CAN'T I'M HAVE A MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. YOU'RE FREE TO QUEUE UP. WE GOT A LOT GOING ON THIS MORNING GOOD MORNING JESSICA GEIGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES WERE OPPOSE LESS AMENDED -- WE'RE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROVISIONS RELATING TO DENITRIFICATION PROTOCOL UNDERSTAND THAT'LL BE ADDRESSED IN EQ BUT SUNDAY EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION HERE TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. AS IT CONTINUES FOR IT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANKS. BECKY WITH CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE HAVE PARTICULAR CONCERNS WITH THE TIMBERLAND PROVISIONS IN THE BILL -- WE APPRECIATE THE MEANING THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND HOPE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE POVISIONS REMOVED FROM THE BILL. OKAY THANKS. ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SAYING NONE WE'RE GONNA TAKE A pHERE. SO -- SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL CENTERS STERN YEARS TURN HERE JONES ALLEN. ALLEN HERE BURGESS. MERGES HERE CABALLERO HERTZBERG HUESO. SO HERE JACKSON MONEY. MONEY IN HERE. OKAY VERY GOOD. NOW WE HAVE A FULL COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED -- NO MORE OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO DIS QUESTIONS MEMBERS. MISTER VICE CHAIR AND CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU SHERMAN [inaudible] I WANTED TO GIVE THIS A THOROUGH REVIEW IS WHILE IT'S ALLOWED HERE. AS THEIR REVIEW IT AS POSSIBLE -- I WENT TO A FISHING THIS PAST WEEK IN OVER IN -- MEMBER MORNINGS -- DISTRICT AND SIR FOR YEARS AS THE CHAIR OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY. SO I'M I HAVE STRONG SYMPATHIES TOWARD MAKING CERTAIN THAT. OUR ENVIRONMENT IS CLEANED AND LOOKED AFTER FOR US AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. I ALSO WANT MAKE CERTAIN THAT WERE WE APPROACH THINGS PRAGMATICALLY. CAN YOU I WAS TRYING TO FIND IS. HAS THERE BEEN A QUANTIFICATION OF THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING THIS REGULATORY SYSTEM OR THESE ENHANCEMENTS I'VE HEARD NUMBERS. KIND OF ALL OVER THE PLACE. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- CENTER AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK -- I MEAN WE'RE ALL TRYING TO BALANCE THE ALL THE THE P. NEEDS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE REALLY PROUD TO HAVE -- ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR LIVING FISHING -- WHO ALSO RELY ON ON THESE RESOURCES ON THERE WE'VE NOT BEEN TO APPROACH YET AND THERE WILL BE -- PRICE I WILL BE PUT ON THAT IT WILL THIS WILL NOT BE -- THERE WILL BE A REAL PRICE TAG ON IT -- YOU'RE HAVING A HEALTHY OCEAN. AFTER EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE -- TO CONTAMINATE OUR OCEANS -- IS IS NOT GOING TO BE CHEAP. SO WE WILL CERTAINLY BE WORKING THROUGH THOSE ISSUES AND TRYING TO MAKE THE BILL'S EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE BUT THERE WILL BE A COST. BUT NOT JUST THOSE FUNDS THAT ARE EXPECTED FROM THE STATE OR FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT BUT ALSO TO BE BORNE BY THE INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES. WHAT WERE WE WILL ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EACH OF THE IMPACTED -- INDUSTRIES -- AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC AGENCIES LIKE THE SANITATION AGENCIES WILL WORK WITH ALL OF THEM -- WE BY BY MY STYLE MY STAFF STYLE IS TO BE VERY COLLABORATIVE -- BUT YOU KNOW AT THE SAME TIME -- WE DO NEED TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY WITH RESPECT TO OUR OUR OCEANS THEIR OTHER BILLS. YOU KNOW AROUND DISCHARGING WASTE WATER INTO THE OCEAN AND THE SINGLE USE PLASTIC SETTER -- GOING TO THE OCEAN SO THIS DOES A LOT WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT OUR OCEANS AND WE WILL ABSOLUTELY WORK. TO WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ON TO TRY TO BE AS COOPERATIVE AS POSSIBLE HEARD -- FROM ONE OF THE FOLKS THAT OFFERED A COMMENT. WHERE IS THE SCIENCE TO JUSTIFY THAT THESE? ENHANCEMENTS WILL PROVE THE METRICS THAT WILL ACHIEVE THAT AND A DESIRE GOAL. I THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF SCIENCE AND IT'S A VERY -- BROAD QUESTION I'LL. ASK OF EITHER MY WITNESSES WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT BUT THAT THAT ENCOMPASSES A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- IN AND IT WON'T LET ME LET ME REFINE IT A BIT -- I HADN'T SEEN IN THE MATERIALS THAT I'VE COME ACROSS -- IS THIS. INDUSTRY SOME ASSUMED AND APPRECIATED -- IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD ACHIEVE THE DESIRED GOAL. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SENATOR. THE THE ANSWER THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES THERE'S A WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE PRODUCED BY AGENCIES AS WELL AS ACADEMICS THAT DEMONSTRATE UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT. THE KINDS OF FOREST PRACTICE CHANGES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN SB SIXTY NINE WOULD PROVIDE WATER QUALITY BENEFITS AND FISHERIES PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCE BENEFITS OF THOSE THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES. EXIST WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF AGGREGATING THEM AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH. WITH THE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE RAISED THEIR OPPOSITION IN THE PAST THOSE CONVERSATIONS. WILL CONTINUE SIR AND I APPRECIATE IT AND THAT'S I THINK THAT'S WHERE I MY I'M ULTIMATELY LEANING IS THIS IDEA THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD. AGGREGATE THAT MATERIAL AND HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. EARLIER THAN IN ITS FINAL FORM OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION OR ITS INTRODUCTORY FORM OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION. I REPRESENT -- AREAS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF TIMBER A LOT OF FORESTRY -- BECAUSE OF ALL THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF OF MY AREA SO NATURALLY YOU KNOW I'M I'M CONCERNED ON HELP. HELLO THIS IS IMPACTING THEM. BUT THERE'S A QUOTE HERE THAT I THOUGHT KIND OF SUMS UP -- THIS FROM THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. SB SIXTY NINE MANDATES A GNETIC TESTING PROTOCOL THAT USES PERCENTAGE BASED TAGGING AND ASSIGNS THE COST OF THE PROTOCOL TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT. IDENTIFYING A PUBLIC FUNDING SOURCE INCREDIBLE INSTITUTION UNDERTAKE INAPPROPRIATE STUDY IS A MORE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION AND HAVING THE LEGISLATURE EMBARK. ON THE MICROMANAGEMENT OF HATCHERIES AND TAGGING TECHNOLOGIES. I THINK THAT IN CAPSULE IT'S AT LEAST A BIT OF WHAT I'M. TRYING TO APPRECIATE HERE IS THAT MAYBE WE'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT. TO FAR AS THE HORSES TOO MUCH HEAD OF THE CART I'M WONDERING. HOW DO WE BRING ALL THIS INFORMATION TOGETHER BECAUSE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS INTRODUCTION BILL -- THAT REALLY IS I THINK SAYS SOMETHING THAT WERE INCLUDING SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS -- IN THE MAYBE MERITORIOUS ABSOLUTELY BUT HOW DO WEBRING THEM TO BEAR AT THE SAME APPROPRIATE TIME SO THEY'RE PERFECTLY RIGHT FOR US TO REVIEW -- ALL IN MY COMMENTS THERE BUT I APPRECIATE THE GOALS THAT YOU'RE PURSUING PRESIDENT AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND OF COURSE IS WERE IN OUR FIRST. BY HEARING OF A WILL BE A LINK THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND WE'VE ALREADY YOU KNOW EXCEPT THE NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- I AM I'M CONFIDENT WE WORKING. COLLABORATIVELY WITH -- CENTER ALAN'S COMMITTEE AND WE'RE GONNA I I THINK I I THINK WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE BILL BETTER BETTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADMIT THAT CENTER WAYS OF THANK YOU EN AND I APPRECIATE THE EXAMPLE THE THIRD TRADUCTION BUT IF YOU'RE VEGAN THERE'S NOTHING AND TRADUCTION FAURIA. GOOD OF IT YOU GET A V. I. P. THERE'S THERE BE GOING TO THE CONCERT. HI THERE OKAY. YEAH. WELL IT IT SAYS THAT IT'S IN THE BONE TO THE BONUS TRACK AND THAT WOULD BE A FRANCISCO WE CAN PRODUCE THAT THE BONE SALARY ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS A A MASSIVE BILL. IT'S ENORMOUS AND IF IT'S LEANING TOWARD. BETTER STEWARDSHIP BY I WANT TO VOTE FOR IT. I'M WONDERING WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF TIS BILL BECAUSE YOUR YOUR SHIFT IN. A REGULAR TERRY OVERSIGHT FROM ONE DEPARTMENT TO ANOTHER YEAR YOU'RE MOVING THINGS AROUND IN A WAY THAT'S IF FROM FROM JUST. A CURSORY REVIEW IT SEEMS VERY AGGRESSIVE TO ME. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE LIST OF SUPPORTERS. AND OPPOSERS IT MAKES ME A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT THE INTENT. OF THE BILL REALLY AS AND IN SOME CASES WE ALWAYS WANT TO STREAMLINE THE REGULATORY PROCESS WE WANT TO MAKE IT USER FRIENDLY -- BUT WE ALSO -- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR OBJECTIVES ARE ARE ACHIEVED IN THAT WE'RE REALLY PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT OUT THERE AND NOT JUST. CREATE INIT SO -- SOME INDUSTRIES COULD NO LONGER EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S JUST MY CONCERN HERE IN LOOKING AT SOME AREAS THAT MAKE ME WONDER WHY IT WHERE DD YOU GET RID -- IDEAS FOR SHIFTING -- REGULATORY VIEW FROM ONE AGENCY TO ANOTHER I MEAN WE CAN WE CAN GET INTO THE DETAILS AND MAYBE THAT'S THAT WOULD TAKE. TOO MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION HERE BUT GENERALLY WHERE DID YOU GET THESE IDEAS FROM I MEAN AE THESE ARE. ARE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM SOME -- INDEPENDENT STUDY OR EVERYONE WHERE DISCOMFORT. THIS WAS -- ACTUALLY REPRESENTS PROBABLY ABOUT A A YEAR AND A HALF WORTH OF WORK THIS WASN'T JUST. YOU KNOW. RIGHT A BILL IN A DAY AND ANOTHER THREE MINUS IS NOT A BILL THAT WAS WRITTEN A DAY I'LL I'LL GIVE MY MY MY OFFICE WORKS -- INTENSELY FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HOUSE -- WITH -- IN AND IT STARTED WITH A FEW DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE. OCEAN HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF YOUR ECOSYSTEMS AROUND HELPED AND OTHER. YOU KNOW -- ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE DYING -- IN THE OCEAN -- AND IT AND WORKING WITH AN EXTENSIVE -- SO STAKEHOLDERS AND AND I THINK I'M PRETTY PROUD OF THE OF THE SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE. ARE FOR THE BILL I CAN ALWAYS IT'S AN AGGRESSIVE BUILD BUT WERE -- FRANKLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE COLLAPSE OF OUR OF SO MANY ECOSYSTEMS. IT WOULD WE ARE WHO WERE IN AN EMERGENCY AND SO -- YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ARE -- WILL CONTINUE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE IMPACTED INDUSTRIES WERE NOT TRYING TO DRIVE ANYONE OUT OF BUSINESS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WE WANT TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK AND AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK -- BUT YES WE DO -- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STUDY. A LOT OF ANALYSIS WE WE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND IT AND IT IS AN EMERGENCY AND WERE -- AM IT'S TIME TO TAKE. STEPS IN TERMS OF REASSIGNMENT AGENCIES THERE WAS THE ONE CONCERN ABOUT THE BALLAST WATER AND STATE LANDS -- COMMISSION AND WE BLOCK IT OUT WE CAN HAVE PERHAPS HAVE A CONVERSATION OFFLINE BUT WE WANTED TO TRY TO MASON IS ALSO BEING ADMINISTERED AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. SENATOR MET MET RESPOND YOUR COMMON QUESTION BRIEFLY I WAS JUST GONNA WRAP UP AND SAY ASK THAT SOME OF THAT INFORMATION THAT -- HI LISA IS THE ANY OF THE STUDIES OR ANY OF OF OF ANY WORKING WORKING GROUP OF PARTICULARLY I GUESS WE'LL.

WHEN WE DO THIS WORK AND DEVELOP OUR TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY REPORT -- WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO CREATE A COMMISSION WE JUST WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT WORK -- HOW WILL BE FUNDED AND WHETHER IT MIGHT BE A TAD REDUNDANT GIVEN THE EXISTING TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP THAT WE WORK WITH WHICH IS EXCEEDINGLY BROAD? AND HAS A VAST ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS -- WE ALSO JUST WANTED TO MENTION THE FUNDING OUR PROGRAM IS FUNDED THROUGH VESSEL FEES AND WE EXPECT THAT -- REVENUE STREAM TO POTENTIALLY DECLINE IN COMING YEARS BECAUSE OF RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATION. THEY WERE JUST VERY COGNIZANT OF THAT AS IT RELATES TO THIS POTENTIAL DO COMMISSION TO LOOK AT THAT. THE SCIENCE AND THE OTHER DATA ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY FOR BALLAST WATER DISCHARGE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS I THANK YOU IN COLLEGE EYES FOR BEING NO NO NO APOLOGY THANK YOU FOR THE THE CONTRIBUTION AND WHAT I KNOW WILL BE ENGAGING IN SOME OF THESE ISSUES TO ANY Q..

HOPEFULLY IS YOU START TO IRON OUT SOME OF THIS SORT OF REGULATORY TOOLS. WE CAN LOOK AT SORT OF HOW TO WRAP. OF FUNDING FRAMEWORK AND REALLY MAKE A DENT THIS YEAR I AGREE IT'S AN EMERGENCY AND I KNOW THERE KINGS TO BE WORKED OUT -- THE BASICS I THINK ARE PRETTY CLEAR WHEN IT COMES TO SAY INLAND IMPACTS. ON THE OCEAN SEDIMENT THAT FLOWS TO THE SEA. HAS AN IMPACT DEPENDING ON WHAT HE CARRIES WITH IT ON THE CERTIFICATION LEVELS ON THE ECOSYSTEMS THERE HOW MUCH FROM WHAT STREAMS. WHO'S RESPONSIBLE THESE ARE ALL TENSIONS TAT THAT WILL FACE GOING FORWARD BUT I THINK THE BASICS OF THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN ONE DOESN'T STAY INLAND IT.

TWENTY FIFTEEN I AUTHORED SB TWENTY FORTY SIX WHICH ADDRESSED THE LACK OF COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLANNING BETWEEN THE STATE THE REGION'S AND LOCAL ENTITIES CALIFORNIA STATE DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB HORIZONTALLY. TALKING TO THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS THIS BILL SB ONE SIX EIGHT IS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP IN THE PROCESS HE CREATES THE CHIEF.

TALKING AMONG THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY WEREN'T. TALKING VERTICALLY AND THE GAME THE ACTION IS HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE REGION LEVEL AND THIS IS GOING TO BE STATUTORILY DISK. THIS SENATE AND THE LEGISLATURE SETTING UP THAT PERSON THAT'S GOING. TO FINAL THE MONEY BUT FINAL FINAL DE THE ADAPTIVE EFFORTS -- THROUGH THE THE GOVERNOR'S -- PLANNING AND RESEARCH -- PLACE THAT'S THAT'S THE IDEA.

WE MIGHT GO TO SETTLE HERE WE GOOD HI KAY MORNING. YEAH. I DON'T KNOW WHERE IS THE ALL RIGHT. FORGET STARTED I'M ALRIGHT WITHOUT MY COUNSEL I'M HERE. PRESENTING SB ONE TO ALL THIS MORNING THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR -- THIS IS THE SECOND COMMITTEE NOW WE'VE BEEN BEFORE AND THE SECOND YEAR WE'VE UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO KERRY THIS MEASURE AND I SAY IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE AS A STATE I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO BE PUT. IN THIS POSITION -- BUT I THINK WE'VE BEEN FORCED -- TO GIVEN THE ACTIONS IN WASHINGTON OVER THIRTY FOUR DIFFERENT. CLEAN AIR WATER ENDANGERED SPECIES -- WORKER SAFETY STANDARDS HAVE BEEN -- WEEKEND OR ELIMINATED. KEY TO BORDERS ON ON EVERYTHING FROM THE WATERS THE U. S. RULE TO THE CLEAN WATER ACT CLEAN AIR ACT STANDARDS IMPORTATION OF IVORY -- BODY PARTS OF THREATENED SPECIES SUCH AS ELEPHANTS AND RHINOS. MS WELL AS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT ADOPTED -- IT WAS W. STOP DISCLOSING TOXIC HAZARDS IN THE WORKPLACE THE DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE HELL THE WORKERS. THESE ARE ALL ACTIONS COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON SO THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL [inaudible] IS THAT. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BACKWARDS THERE'S A LOT OF PROGRESS TO BE MADE WHEN IT COMES TO WORKPLACE SAFETY WHEN IT COMES TO TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING UP. OUR OCEANS OUR WATER OUR AIR OUR LAND IS BE HEARD FROM NUMEROUS AUTHORS EARLIER -- SO PROGRESS REMAINS BUT WE AT LEAST CAN ALLOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER CUT. OUR STATE'S PLENARY POWER TO PROTECT ITS HEALTH AND SAFETY -- TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE CITIZENS CAN. LIVE HERE -- AND AFFORD TO BREED HERE -- AND DRINK THE WATER HERE. AND SO WE CONSIDER THIS A TYPE OF INSURANCE POLICY THAT HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE TO EXERCISE -- BUT IF NECESSARY -- THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE STATE AGENCIES TO STEP IN AND AT LEAST ENFORCE THE BASELINE STANDARDS THAT WE LEFT AT THE END OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. WE KNOW THE FEDERAL STANDARDS ARE OFTEN WEAK -- EVEN EVEN WHEN IT'S A SOLID PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVES IN SCIENCE BUT IN THIS CASE. WE'RE FACING ADMINISTRATION AND FRANKLY CONGRESS THAT THAT -- WE FEEL IS A RISK -- THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO POKE ANYONE IN THE EYE -- BACK IN DC AND IN FACT WE WHICH WE WERE IN THIS FIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT HERE WE ARE AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD AND ASSERT OUR PLENARY POWER AND DO WE HAVE TO DO TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE SO. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I THOUGHT. THANK YOU SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KIM DELFINO AND THE CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR FOR DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE WERE -- NATIONAL ORGANIZATION BUT BASED HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA -- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB ONE THE THREAT TO CALIFORNIA'S AIR WATER AND WILDLIFE IS REAL -- IT JUST IN FEBRUARY THE U. S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION RELEASED DOCUMENTS THAT JUSTIFY LOOSENING THE RESTRICTIONS ON PROTECTING THE DELTA. AND IT'S IMPORTANT -- IMPERIL POPULATIONS OF DELTA SMELT AND MIGRATING SALMON AND WE EXPECT THAT A NEW SET OF DELTA EXPORT RULES WILL BE IN PLACE BY THE SUMMER AND THEY WILL BE WEAKER. THAN THE CURRENT FEDERAL PROTECTIONS OF FURTHER ON OUR PUBLIC LANDS WERE SEEN PROPOSALS TO WEEKEND EXISTING WILDLIFE PROTECTIONS -- IN ON PLAN SUCH AS THE DESERT RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSERVATION PLAN THAT COVERS NEARLY TEN MILLION ACRES OF LAND MANAGEMENT PLAN. FORNEY HAS A LOT TO LOSE IF THE IF IF THE CURRENT -- RIGHT ROLL BACKS ARE SUCCESSFUL ACCORDING TO NATURE SERVE CLIFORNIA'S THE MOST BIOLOGICALLY DIVERSE STATE IN THE NATION AND NOT HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF ENDEMIC SPECIES. WHICH OUR SPECIES FOUND NOWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET. IT CALIFORNIA IS ALSO HOME TO THE THIRD HIGHEST NUMBER OF EXTINCT SPECIES AND THE SECOND HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF SPECIES AT RISK. AND ON OUR FEDERAL LANDS WHICH ARE VERY CONCENTRATED WITH WILDLIFE THE ENCOMPASSES NEARLY HALF OF OUR STATE. AND THAT'S ROLL BACKS IN PROTECTIONS FOR WILDLIFE HABITAT AND PUBLIC LANDS WILL HAVE A PROFOUND AND COSTLY AFFECT ON CALIFORNIA. EXCEPT THAT THESE ROLL BACKS DON'T JUST RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA WILDLIFE THE THREAT THEY POSE A THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL. INTERNATIONAL WILDLIFE AND UNDERMINE IMPORTANT LAWS THAT WE'VE ENACTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT INTERNATIONAL WILDLIFE. SPECIFICALLY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS LIFTED A BAN ON IMPORTING SPORT HUNTED TROPHIES OF ELEPHANTS FROM CERTAIN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. AND THE FISHER WALLACE SERVICES ALSO ISSUED AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF PERMITS FOR LION TROPHIES SINCE AUTHORIZING IMPORTS FROM ZIMBABWE AND ZAMBIA -- THAT WERE FIRST ALLOWED IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE'S AT LEAST -- SO I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS THAT WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS ENACTED LAWS TO PER PROTECT OUR WILDLIFE AND IN PARTICULAR TO PERMIT TRADE. ONLINE AN ELEPHANT PARTS -- THERE IS DEFINITE CONCERN THAT THESE ROBOTS ARE GONNA HAVE IMPACT SB ONE WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY SETTING A BASELINE OF PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIA'S WILDLIFE. BY SIMPLY REQUIRING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION REVIEW ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO DETERMINE IF THEY WEEKEND PRIOR PROTECTIONS AND THEN TAKE ACTIONS TO ESTABLISH THOSE PROTECTIONS IF THE STANDARDS WERE WEEKEND. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO SB ONE WOULD ALSO ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF ILLEGAL IMPORTATION OF WILDLIFE PARTS BY CONFIRMING THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SALE OR PURCHASE OF FISHER WHILE I FOR PLANTS TAKEN POSSESSED. TRANSPORTED OR SOLD IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL STATE OR AN INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE STILL A VIOLATION OF LAW. AND THEN THE LAST AMENDMENT THAT WAS PROPOSED REGARDING SPECIES SUBSPECIES AND DISTINCT POPULATION SEGMENTS IS REALLY JUST A CLARIFYING -- AMENDMENT THAT WOULD TRUE UP -- THIS UP BILL WITH THE FEDERAL ESA. SB ONE IS AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION FOR OUR STATES WILDLIFE AND IT IS A COMMON SENSE PROTECTION AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING SENATOR SIAM LINDA ESCALANTE WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL OR AN RTC I'M HERE ON BEHALF. OF OUR NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA. TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB. ONE WHICH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORKER SAFETY PROTECTIONS. AGAINST THE RECKLESS TAX FROM OUR FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. SB ONE WOULD INCORPORATE INTO X. TO STATE LAW EXISTING FEDERAL STANDARDS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT THE CLEAN WATER ACT THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT AND THE WORKER SAFETY LAWS. IF THEY ARE ROLLED BACK. THOSE STANDARDS CURRENTLY APPLYING TO AFFECTED INDUSTRIES THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT. BUT IT DOES MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO IN CALIFORNIA IF FORCES IN DC SUCCEED A ROLLING BACK THOSE CRITICAL PROTECTIONS. AS YOU WILL NOW CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY ARE SUFFERING FROM THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THEM CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE STRUGGLE WITH POOR AIR QUALITY. AND WATER QUALITY DESPITE INCREASINGLY FREQUENT AN UNPRECEDENTED NATURAL DISASTERS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO PUSH THE ANTI ENVIRONMENT AGENDA THAT BENEFITS POLLUTERS AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR NATION'S MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS. OUR PEOPLE AND OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. ALLOWING POLLUTION FROM OTHER STATES TO CROSS STATE LINES AT HIGHER LEVELS WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE DANGERS HEALTH IMPACTS THIS COULD HAVE ON FAMILIES. TO DISMANTLING PROTECTIONS FOR LOCAL DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES RIVER SINCE ESTUARIES. ALLOWING MORE TOXIC POLLUTANTS SUCH AS ARSENIC LEAD AND MERCURY TO BE DISCHARGED INTO OR SURFACE WATERS. TO QUIETLY PROPOSING TO LITERALLY CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF AMBIENT AIR TO ALLOW COMPANIES TO CIRCUMVENT AIR POLLUTION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS AND THE LIST OF FEDERAL THREATS AND ROLL BACKS. GOES ON AND IT'S ALARMING. NOW SOME OF THE APPOINTMENTS OPEN AS OF THIS BILL ARGUE THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THE ADMINISTRATION DOES BAD THINGS BEFORE REACTING ON APPEAL MADE PEACE MET MEAL BASIS. BUT WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY. OF REACTING TO EACH DECISION THAT COMES DOWN FROM DC. GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY PACE OF THE ATTACKS. AS WE ONE SIMPLY SET UP A PROCESS FOR SPECIFIED AGENCIES TO BREAK OR REGULARLY REVIEW CHANGES HIS FEDERAL STANDARDS AND CONSIDER ADOPTING INTO STATE LAW EXISTING BASELINE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS FOR CLEAN AIR. CLEAN WATER ENDANGERED SPECIES AND WORKER SAFETY AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE HERE TO BUILD ON ITS ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP. AND PUT IN PLACE AND EVEN STRONGER FIREWALL AGAINST SHORT SIGHTED ACTIONS. FROM THE FEDS BECAUSE THERE'S NO DOUBT. THAT THEY ARE HELL BENT ON WEAKENING OUR BEDROCK ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS SB ONE IS CALIFORNIA PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS IN THE ENVIRONMENT OUR LIVES DEPEND ON THANK YOU AND I URGE FOR YOU'RE ABLE WHICH FIVE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

MORNING. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ADAM WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OR HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I WANNA BEGIN WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO SB ONE STATED INTENT OF PRESERVING CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP. AND LABOR LEADERSHIP. FIVE DECADES AGAINST ANY FEDERAL ROLL BACKS. THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE FIFTY PLUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE OPPOSE OPPOSE ON TECHNICAL AND PROCESS SEES IN SB ONE THAT WE FEEL HAVE ON AND HAD A CONSEQUENCES. ON THE REGULATED COMMUNITY -- I WANNA I'D BE REMISS NOT TO SAY THAT WE THE OPPOSITION HAVE BEEN -- DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PROPONENTS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AND WE'VE BEEN OPERATE IN GOOD FAITH I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT. SB ONE CAN BE. AMENDED TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS AND STILL PRESERVE THE INTENT OF THE BILL WHICH IS TO PREVENT FEDERAL ROLLBACKS -- IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR CONTEXT. BUT SB ONE IS AN INCREDIBLY BROAD BILL IT DEALS WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT CLEAN WATER ACT THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT. AND ALL WE DID OUR OR LAWS UNDER THE FEDERAL LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY SIX WHICH TO BE CANDID IS THE HE ANYONE OF THESE ISSUE AREAS COULD BE A BILL. IN AND OF ITSELF AND WE GET WHY SB ONE IS INCREDIBLY BROAD BUT BECAUSE IT IS BROAD -- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL ISSUES IN THE BILL -- THAT WE FEEL MUST BE ADDRESSED AND FOR THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW. FIRST SEIZURE ACT DUE PROCESS THAT MEANS NO NOTICE -- NO PUBLIC COMMENT THAT'S FOR NGOS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND OBVIOUSLY THE THE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THESE. NEW REGULATIONS. THE THERE IS NO OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OVERSIGHT AT ALL IN THE BILL. SO BASICALLY -- THE SIX A. P. A. STANDARDS ARE NOT AT ALL ADDRESS. FOR ANY PROFLIGATE RULE MAKING. AND JUST TO ADDRESS THE THE IDEA THAT SB ONE LITERALLY COPIES AND PASTES FEDERAL LAW IN THE STATE LAW IS -- OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF HOW ALL FEDERAL AND STATE LAW -- INTERACT I THINK THE PUBLICATION OF RULE MAKING THE DEVIL IN THE DETAILS AND PUBLIC NOTICE AND COMMENT ARE ESSENTIAL. TO AVOID THE ONLY OTHER REDRESS WOULD BE LITIGATION AND SO FOR US. THAT'S ONE MAJOR CONCERN AND ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE IS -- AROUND THE BIOLOGICAL -- OPINIONS AND IT'S IT'LL TAKE PERMITS UNDER HOW THE ESSAYS OPERATES UNDER SB ONE WE DO NOT OPPOSE HOW SB -- ONE ADDRESSES -- THE LISTING OR DOWN THE SCENE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT AGAIN HOW THEY GO ABOUT THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR PROPONENTS WE ARE WORKING TO ADDRESS THESE TECHNICAL CONCERNS BUT OVERALL ARE NOT OPPOSE THE INTENT. THANK YOU. THE MORNING NO -- KRAMER'S THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION. I THINK WE WE SHARE THE THE TECHNICAL CONCERNS THAT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- OUTLINED I WANT TO GET A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC IN THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. SO THE BILL I'M PURPORTS TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING ANY SPECIES ARE CHANGES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE CHALLENGES IT ALSO GIVES THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. GREATER AUTHORITY TO STEP IN AND STOP ACTIONS AND CONTROL ACTIONS -- IN WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IS INVOLVED. THAT IS THE LARGEST CONCERN I AM BUT ON THE THE DELISTING AND DOWN LISTING PIECE IS IT DOESN'T REALLY ALLOW FOR A RECOGNITION THAT TIME SOMETIMES THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS SUCCESSFUL AND SPECIES ARE RECOVERED. AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE THE BILL RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T NEED TO LIST SPECIES IF THEY'RE REMOVED IT FROM THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT BECAUSE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THEY HAVE RECOVERED. SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH I'M THE OTHER ISSUE WHICH IS IS MUCH LARGER. IS HOW THIS WILL AFFECT THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. IN THAT NOW SB ONE WOULD GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE GREATER AUTHORITY TO SAY NO TO ANY CHANGES THAT COULD BE VIEWED. AS BACKSLIDING SO IF WE ARE FOLLOWING SCIENCE AND SCIENCE DICTATES CHANGES YET BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OR TWENTY FIFTEEN OR TWO THOUSAND WE WEREN'T AS UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCIENCE. AND SO THE FEDERAL STANDARDS AT THAT DATE WERE DIFFERENT WE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED UNDER SB ONE TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AND SO UNDER THOSE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. THEY MAY BE THROWN OUT OR MAY NOT BE ALLOWED TO PROCEED BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT COULD GET SUED IF THEY ALLOW AN ACTION THAT COULD BE VIEWED AS BACKSLIDING. THAT'S OUR BIGGEST CONCERN. I'M IS THAT. IT'S GOING TO STOP ACTIONS AND STOP CALIFORNIA FROM MOVING FORWARD WITH THE SCIENCE. AND THE OTHER PIECE THE BILL ALSO HAS A PROVISION THAT ATTEMPTS TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AUTHORITY -- OVER CONTROL OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH -- SEASON NOW BUT THE BILL IS DOING IS TRYING TO EQUATE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROTECTIONS WITH WATER RATES -- AND FINALLY ON THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS I THINK THERE DOES NEED TO BE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE DISTINCT POPULATION SEGMENT WE DO NOT LIST -- DISTINCT POPULATION SEGMENTS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW SB ONE ACTUALLY DID A GOOD JOB OF RECOGNIZING. UNLIKE IN SB FORTY NINE THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD ONLY BE LISTING SPECIES THAT ARE ALLOWED TO BE LISTED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA LAW. I'M SO THERE DOES NEED TO BE MORE DISCUSSION ON THAT. THAK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL IF YOU CAN STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION AND IF YOU CHOOSE -- WHERE YOU'RE FROMIN THE STATE THAT BE FINE -- TOO TOM JACOB ON BEHALF OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA THE POST FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. KELLY GOVERNOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS STATED. JOHN LEWIS THE NATIONAL FEDERATION IN A MINUTE BUSINESS REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO POSE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE TO COME HAVE A CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL CALIFORNIA CONGENERS AND REYES ASSOCIATION WESTERN AG PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION -- CALIFORNIA TOMATO GROWERS ASSOCIATION IN VARIOUS OTHER AG TRADE ASSOCIATIONS AND COMMISSIONS IN OPPOSITION BUT WE DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THAT PRO TEM STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US. MR TURN MEMBERS BETH A LOSS OF JUST FOR THE AGRICULTURAL ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING THE COOKING UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. THAT IS ALL WE ONLY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA GRAIN FEED ASSOCIATION COVERS THE DISSOCIATION THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE AND THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND AND WE'LL. KEEP WORKING ON THE PROCESS. SURE MEMBERS CANDIDATE JOGO THE QUALITY GROUP ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND CONFOUNDS A HEARING OPPOSITION AS WELL. HE'LL TELL HIM WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION -- WHILE WE AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT -- WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE REGULATORY COSTS ON FARMERS. JUST A A NOTE THAT OVER SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THERE WAS A STUDY DONE ON A SALINAS. LETTUCE GROWER AND HIS REGULATORY COSTS OF THE HUMOR TO THE FACT OF ALL THE REGULATORY -- REQUIREMENTS FOR FOR FARMERS HAS RISEN ALMOST 8100%. SO WHEN YOU GO FROM A HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS AN ACRE. ON REGULATORY COSTS -- TO NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AN ACRE. YOU'RE PUTTING FARMERS WHO GROW FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PRETTY MUCH OUT OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD. A AND LIKE YOU'D BE COGNIZANT OF THAT THANK YOU. CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES IN OPPOSITION. THE OTHER SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. SING NOBODY MAKING THEIR WAY TO THE MICROPHONE -- CENTER STERN I'VE RECEIVED TWO NOTES ASKING YOU IF YOU ARE GOING TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. I AM I THINK THAT'LL HELP THE CONVERSATION SO -- THERE'S NO OTHER SPEAKERS I WILL BRING THE DISCUSSION TO THE DÃ­AS -- CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU JUST WANTED A STATE. AND FOR THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW I I AM [inaudible] SYMPATHETIC THAT. THIS CREATES SOME CONFLICT. WHAT THE FEDS? BUT SOMETIMES WE NEED CONFLICT. WITH A GOVERNMENT THAT'S TRYING TO ATTACK. ARE VERY HEALTH. OUR ECONOMY. OUR ENVIRONMENT. WITH NO REAL SCIENCE BUT NO REAL ACTION BASED ON SOLID SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES WE WE OFTEN HEAR. WHAT'S THE SCIENCE WHAT'S A SCIENCE AND NOBODY SEEMS TO BE ASKING WHAT'S THE SCIENCE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. AND THERE IS NO SCIENCE. AND AND WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE AT THAT THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC. RISE UP AND SAY THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND IT'S CREATING HURT US. AS BUSINESS PEOPLE AND FARMERS AND AND YES IT WILL. WHAT DO WE DO WE JUST SIT BACK AND LET THEM ROLL OVER? ALL THE ALL THE WORK WE'VE DONE TO FOR YOU KNOW PROTECT OUR STATE WE WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL STATE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A LOT OF THREATEN WATER BODIES I REPRESENT. BUT TWO OF THEM. I REPRESENT A SEE THAT IS ENDANGERED AND SHRINKING IN AND WILL PRETTY MUCH [inaudible] HURT PEOPLE. BY A IT'S ALREADY HURTING PEOPLE'S CAUSING ASTHMA. THIS IS MISS MINISTRATION HAS BEEN SILENT ON THAT THE CUENTA RIVER VALLEY ON THE NEW RIVER ON THE SALTON SEA. WE HAVE MORE THREATENED SPECIES NOW THAN EVER AND THEIR SILENT ON THAT. ON ON ON GLOW THEIR SILENT ON GLOBAL CHANGE ON CLIMATE CHANGE. EVERYTHING THAT IS. LEE THE BIGGEST THREAT ON OUR HEALTH. I IN OUR EXISTENCE. THERE ARE SILENT ON THE QUOTE QUITE THE CONTRARY THEY'RE TAKING THEIR GOING BACK DECADES AND DECADES. IN HISTORY. TO REPEAT POLICIES THAT GOT US EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE WHEN WE NEED TO DO THE OPPOSITE. SO. I THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AT THIS TIME OF WAR WHERE WE WHERE WHEN. WE ARE DEALING WITH SOMEBODY THAT -- LEADING THIS COUNTRY BACK -- TO A PAST. THAT HAS CREATED ENORMOUS PROBLEMS. YES. THAT WE NEED TO BE SOLVING NOW WHEN AND I I THINK. I'D LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION WHERE'S THE SCIENCE WARS ASSIGNMENTS IN YOUR ACTIONS. SO WE CAN SO WE CAN SUPPORT THE SUN. IF THERE'S NONE. AND IF THERE'S NO SCIENCE THEY SHOULD DO SOME ABOUT IT BECAUSE THIS IS AND THIS IS NOT GOOD WHAT'S HAPPENING IN EVERY. ASPECT OF OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. I MEAN THERE THE LIST IS SO LARGE THAT. MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE TIME. TO SPEND TO JUST GO THROUGH. ALL THE HORRIBLETHINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY AND I THINK WE NEED TO FIGHT BACK AND THIS IS A BILL AT LEAST. IT THIS SEEMS LIKE. A REASONABLE BILL TO ME BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM WE SHOULD BE DOING BUT BUT AT LEAST. THIS IS A STATUS QUO BILL AND I THINK FURTHER OUR STAFF LOCALLY -- AS THEY TRY TO ENFORCE THIS. YOU KNOW THIS THIS WILL BE MUCH EASIER TO DO THAN IF WE CREATED ENORMOUS CHANGES SAY NOW WE HAVE. TO CREATE NEW REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW I THINK. IN DEALING WITH ANY CHANGES IF THEY'RE NOT BASED ON SOLID SCIENCE IT GIVES US. A PLATFORM TO ROUTE TO TO CHALLENGE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE HAVE TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THAT AND WHATEVER. WHATEVER THE REACTION IS ON OUR BEHALF IT'S GOING TO BE BASED ON OF FEDERAL ACTION THAT'S NOT BASED ON SCIENCE AND I THINK WILL WIN THAT DEBATE IN COURT. AND IF IT AND IF FOR CHOIRS THIS TO DO THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO WE HAVE -- TO WE HAVE TO MARK MARK OUR POSITION AND HOLD IT. AND NOT LET UP. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND I EVEN LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND SCALE. POSSIBLE THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SIR HUESO SENATOR BARGES. I I COME AT THIS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE -- REPRESENTING -- THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- I FIRST CAME TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY AFTER LAW SCHOOL TO CLERK FOR A FEDERAL JUDGE -- NATIONALLY REGARDED BY WATER JUDGE. AND DURING THE YEAR OF THAT CLERKSHIP -- I WAS INUNDATED -- INTO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. AND WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANT FOR AGRICULTURE FOR FISHING -- ANYTHING THAT -- IN ITS TENTACLES WOULD REACH INTO. WHAT I REALIZED IS THAT? THE INTERPRETATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THE POLITICAL. INFLUENCE AGENTS THAT WERE AT PLAY IN THIS. IT'S EASY FOR US TO TAKE A STEP BACK OR TOO EASY FOR US TO TO COMMENT THAT. THIS IS A WASHINGTON VERSUS SACRAMENTO ISSUE IF WASHINGTON WON'T STEP IN AND SACRAMENTO MUST. I THINK THAT IS A GROSS OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF A VERY SOPHISTICATED PROBLEM. THAT IS DEALING WITH THE LIFESTYLE -- THAT EXIST IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT IF WE IF WE GIVE UNFETTERED POWERS THE STATE AGENTS. GIVEN THE THE INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN -- LAYERS HAVE IN THE CAPITAL HERE. I'M AFRAID THAT THE HUMAN ELEMENT THAT HAS BEEN LITIGATE -- FOR YEARS IN PARTICULAR WE GO BACK TO THE DELTA SMELT ISSUE. HOW EXACTLY DOES THE PROTECTION OF? THE SPECIES WHERE THERE IS DIVERGENT BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS. BUT ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN THE FOLLOWING OF GROUND BECAUSE FARMERS IN AGRICULTURALIST CANNOT SURVIVE. WE CALL OURSELVES THE BREAD BASKET OF OF THE WORLD. WELL THAT'S NOT GOING TO CONTINUE FOLKS. WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT GOAL WAY. SO WE MAY BE LOOKING AT ENVIRONMENTAL A PRISTINE VISION FOR TOMORROW AND TAKING UP THE MANTLE AGAINST WASHINGTON. BUT WE ARE ERODING WAY HOW WE PRODUCE FOOD IN IN THE VALLEY AND ELSEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO ELL I APPRECIATE THE STATED GOALS OF THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION. I THINK IT IS. TO DRIVING AWAY AGRICULTURE FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT JUST. UP FROM THE VALLEY BUT WINE COUNTRY AND IN FISHING I THINK WE ARE OPENING UP A PANDORA'S BOX -- WE HEARD FROM ONE OF THE FOLKS WHO TESTIFIED EARLIER. THAT IF WE BELIEVE THAT SCIENCE IS PROGRESSIVE AND I DO BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. IN ANY OF THOSE THAT -- THAT THINK OTHERWISE I THINK NEED TO OPEN UP THEIR TEXTBOOKS I BELIEVE IN -- SCALI MET THAT I BELIEVE IN PEER REVIEW. IT HAS ABSOLUTE MERIT. AND FOR THOSE THAT THINK THAT SCIENCE SHOULD BE TOSSED OUT WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE BALANCE SCIENCE WITH OUR WAY OF LIFE. HE CANNOT BE ONE OR THE OTHER IT HAS TO BE BOTH IN THEY HAVE TO BE SYNERGISTC AN APPRECIATIVE OF THE OTHER SURVIVAL. AND MY MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS DOES NOT DO THAT. THIS IS TAKING A WASHINGTON FIGHT BUT KILLING. OUR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE THAT'S MY PERSONAL OPINION. THE OTHER SENATORS COMMENTS QUESTIONS [inaudible] THUNDERSTORMS. THANK YOU. I'LL CLOSE. OKAY WELL. I'LL JUST SAY. BUT BEFORE YOU CLOSED PLEASE LET'S MAKE SURE WE HAVE A MOTION. OKAY YEAH YOU MAY CLOSE VERY GOOD. I WANT TO ADDRESS IN THE CLOSE SOME OF THE SENSITIVITIES AROUND THERE SPECIALLY IN THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE BROADER BUSINESS COMMUNITY -- THERE'S A TRUST DEFICIT RIGHT NOW WITH WASHINGTON. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S DRIVING THIS. GIVEN OIL LOBBYIST. EARNING DEPARTMENT INTERIOR AND A COLD LOBBYIST RUNNING EPA THAT DOESN'T. EARN US A LOT OF DIFFERENCE TOWARDS THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY. I RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT FOLKS HAVE FACED OVER THE YEARS WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT BUT I WILL SAY THE QUALM THAT I'M HEARING. TODAY IS NOT SO MUCH WITH THE STATE'S ROLE BUT WITH THE MECHANICS OF THE LAW. THE ADMINISTRATION HOWEVER OF THAT LAW. WE DO NOT -- PROPOSE HERE SOME RADICAL OVERHAUL OF HOW IT'S CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED AND ENFORCED -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OPPOSITE OF UNFETTERED IS BUT I THINK THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S PLENTY OF FEDERATION -- I GUESS IN THIS LEGISLATION OR AT LEAST THAT'S THE INTENT -- THAT THIS IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE A SORT OF WIDE OPEN DOOR -- TO PASS A WHOLE SERIES OF NEW UNANTICIPATED REGULATIONS THIS IS ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO HELP THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAVE SOME CERTAINTY THAT AT LEAST THINGS ARE GOING TO STAY THE WAY THEY WERE. BACK BEFORE WE FORGOT ABOUT SCIENCE AND WE'RE HOPING THAT WITH THAT SORT OF BRIEF PERIOD OF CALM WE CAN GET THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND GET BACK TO NORMAL -- THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY START TO MOVE FOR TO WRESTLE WITH SOME OF THESE LARGER ISSUE SO. LOOK I RECOGNIZE THIS THIS CREATES AN UNCOMFORTABLE TENSION AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS GONNA NECESSITATES A MAD BECAUSE HE BACK IN WASHINGTON ESPECIALLY FROM OUR PARTNERS IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SAY. STOP THE GAME PLAYING LIKE WE WE CANNOT PLAY SOME HIGH STAKES GAMBLE WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT OR WITH YOU KNOW ENDANGERED AFRICAN SPECIES THAT ARE BEING TROPHY HUNTED AND WE'RE GONNA SUDDENLY JUST UP GIVE A BACK DOOR BECAUSE SOMEONE WANTS TO HOLD THE TAIL AND LOOK LIKE A TOUGH GUY -- THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS ON I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN PRODUCTIVE THUS FAR AND I DO APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK -- AND I APPRECIATE ALSO THE BIG KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT. THE THE THE THE INTENT THAT THERE ACTUALLY IS SOME COHESION HERE AND I WANT TO SEE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE RC CALIFORNIA BUSINESS SHOW THEMSELVES TO BE BOLD AND TO BE PROGRESSIVE I THINK WE HAVE A PATH TO GET THERE. BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY AND I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT THIS INSURANCE POLICY IN PLACE BUT ARE THE TIMES DEMANDED SO. WITH THAT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I THOUGHT. THE USER STERN L. CAN CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY SENATOR STERN HI STERN I'D JONES. GEN SNOW ALLEN ALLEN AYE BARGES BARGES SNOW COVER EURO. HERTZBERG HUESO. HUESO AYE JACKSON MONEY IN THE BILL'S ON CALL [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR -- WELCOME SENATOR ROTH WE HAVE -- SB THREE OH SEVEN FILE ITEM NUMBER. SEVEN RIGHT CHANGING OF THE GUARD. TECH CLEAN UP. WELCOME CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL -- THREE OH SEVEN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST -- TWENTY YEARS COULD TEASE A CORPORATE LANDAU AROUND IN THE MOJAVE DESERT. HAS PROPOSED TO PUMP AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER PER YEAR THAT'S OVER SIXTEEN BILLION GALLONS. FOR FIFTY YEARS FROM THE AQUIFER UNDERNEATH THE MOJAVE. AND SELL IT TO VARIOUS WATER DISTRICTS IN ORANGE AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES IN OTHER COUNTIES AT A PROFIT FOR PURPOSES OF GUARANTEEING WATER. TO ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW HOMES. THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE SCIENCE IS IN CONFLICT AS TO WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE LEVEL OF PUMPING IS. AND IF FRANKLY COULD THESE IS WRONG ON THE SUBJECT A LEVEL OF PUMPING COULD POTENTIALLY DESTROY THE MOJAVE DESERT. IN THE PROCESS THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL. THIS BILL SEEKS TO HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON ON THIS MASSIVE WATER EXTRACTION PROJECT. IN THIS VERY FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM THAT HAS EXISTED IN BALANCE FOR CENTURIES. HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON SO WE REVIEW ANALYZE AND GET THE SCIENCE RIGHT. NOW THE PROJECT HAS BEEN STALLED FOR YEARS BECAUSE IN THE MINDS OF MANY THE MATH JUST DOESN'T ADD UP. KITTY IS AS I SAID WANTS TO PULL FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR OUT BUT I CAN'T EVEN HEAR MYSELF. BUT ADMITS THAT THE AQUIFER ONLY REFILLS AT A RATE OF THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. RENOWNED SCIENTISTS WORKING WITH THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE. SAY THE REFILL RATE IS MORE LIKE NOW KIDDIES HASN'T EVAPORATION THEORY TO ATTACH TO THE PROJECT. ON WHICH IT'S PUMPING PLAN IS BASED. BUT THE SCIENTIFIC REPORTS ARE IN CONFLICT AS TO THE EFFICACY INVALIDITY OF THAT EVAPORATION PLAN. SO IF THE U. S. G. S. AND THE PARK SERVICE SCIENCE IS CORRECT. THAT'S AT LEAST FORTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR FOURTEEN BILLION GALLONS LESS THAN THE COULD THESE PLAN. CLEARLY. THERE IS A SERIOUS CONFLICT IN THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT'S THAT'S BEING PRESENTED IN THIS CASE AND THAT SURROUNDING THIS PROJECT. AND IF COULD DISS MISCALCULATED THE SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE NOT ONLY WILL THE ECO SYSTEM IN THE HOBBY FACE DESTRUCTION. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW HOUSEHOLDS THAT COME TO DEPEND ON THE WATER SUPPLY. THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WILL HAVE A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AS WELL IF AND WHEN COULD DISS FORCED TO STOP PUMPING. SO WE THINK THAT CONFLICT SHOULD BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE PUMPING STARTS AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES NO MORE NO LESS. NOW YOU HAVE HEARD OR WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT KIDDIES IN THE CUT A SEQUEL RATHER IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL SEQUEL. AND HOW COULD THESE IN ITS PROJECTS OF ONE FIVE OR SIX SEQUEL LAWSUITS. AND THAT THE COURTS HAVE CLEARLY RESOLVE THE SCIENCE IN FAVOR OF CANDIES AND HAVE VALIDATED. IT'S PUMPING PROPOSAL UNFORTUNATELY THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH SEEK WINDOW THAT IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE. SEEK WHAT IS A PUBLIC DISCLOSURE STATUTE THAT REQUIRES PROJECT PROPONENTS AND THE COURTS TO IDENTIFY THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT. THOSE IMPACTS IN FACT IN REVIEWING THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR AND AGAINST THE PROJECTS SUCH AS THE PUMPING RATES HERE. AS THE COURT IN COULD DISS OWN APPELLATE CASE NOTED COURTS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO WEIGH AND RESOLVE CONFLICTS. IN THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE PRESENTED AND THIS IS WHAT THE COURT SAID IN THAT APPELLATE DECISION IN REVIEWING THE LEAD AGENCIES ACTIONS UNDER SEQUEL WE MAY NOT. SET ASIDE AN AGENCIES APPROVAL OF ANY I ARE ON THE GROUND AT THE OPPOSITE CONCLUSION WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY OR MORE REASONABLE IN OTHER WORDS. NO WEIGHING OF SCIENCE. NOW IN CASE THERE'S ANY DOUBT AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE SINCE I'VE BEEN SAYING THE SAME THING FROM THE OUTSET OF MY PARTICIPATION IN THIS BILL I AM NOT -- WILL REPEAT NOT TRYING TO PREVENT THE PUMPING OF WATER FROM THIS AQUIFER BYE KIDDIES. FOR ANY FUTURE LANDOWNER IN THE MOJAVE BECAUSE THIS BILL IS NOT STRICTLY TARGETING TO DETECT GOODIES. IT IS A BILL PROTECTING THE MOJAVE DESERT FROM LANDOWNERS WHO PROPOSED TO PUMP WATER FROM THE AQUIFER. I'M SIMPLY TRYING TO ENSURE THAT ANY PUMPING NEW OR IN THE FUTURE IS DONE AT AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE RATE [inaudible] SO. TO BRING THIS TO A CLOSE I THINK WE SHOULD HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON AND HEAD OF AN INDEPENDENT TEAM OF SCIENTISTS REVIEWED THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. FOR AND AGAINST THE KIDDIES PROJECT. AND RESOLVE THE CONFLICT AND THEN BASED ON THAT REVIEW SAID ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE ONE THAT ENSURES AN UNINTERRUPTED SUPPLY OF WATER TO ALL RESIDENTS. WHILE PRESERVING AND PROTECTING THIS NATIONAL TREASURE WE CALL THE MOJAVE FROM ANY POTENTIAL MANMADE DESTRUCTION. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SENATE BILL THREE OF SEVEN DOES NO MORE OR NO LESS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT IN TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT -- WILL DO -- TWO MINUTES EACH FOR THE LEAD WITH Q.. GOOD MORNING CHAIR STERN SENATORS NEIL THE SIDE WITH THE NATIONAL PARKS CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR NATIONAL PARKS FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS. AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB THREE OH SEVEN TO PROTECT OUR CALIFORNIA DESERT. WE SEE THE CALIFORNIA DESERT AS A AS AN ASSET WORTHY OF CONTINUED INVESTMENT WE TOGETHER HAVE PROTECTED LANDSCAPES INCREASE RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES IN INCOME INCREASE THE QUALITY OF LIVES. FOR SO MANY PEOPLE WITHIN THE STATE AND PROTECTED ICONIC PLACES LIKE JOSHUA TREE IN THE MOJAVE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME -- KIDDIES IS EXHIBIT A OF FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION BACKSLIDING THAT HARMS OUR NATIONAL PARKS. BOB THE CONCERNS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ROLLBACKS THAT WE'RE WE'RE JUST DISCUSS DIED DURING SB ONE ON WHAT THEY'RE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN OUR CALIFORNIA DESERT THIS IS REAL -- SO PRIOR TO THE FEDERAL THIS FEDERAL MINISTRATION COULD THESE WERE WAS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE FEDERAL NEED TO REVIEW IN ADDITION TO SEE WHAT BECAUSE THE PROJECT PIPELINE WOULD RUN THROUGH THE MOJAVE TRAILS NATIONAL MONUMENTS. AND WOOD OVER DRAFTING AQUIFER THAT IMPACTS UP TO A LOT MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES OF FEDERALLY PROTECTED LANDS. THESE WERE THE RULES AND THEY PROVIDE A CERTAINTY TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS PROJECT YOU KNOW FOR DECADES PRIOR. SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE HISTORY NGUYEN KIDDIES AS PROPOSED TWENTY YEARS AGO IT UNDERWENT BOTH FEDERAL AND SEQUEL REVIEW. ODJICK WAS REVIEWED BY THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT AND THAT DISTRICT REJECTED THE PROJECT -- BECAUSE IT THE FEDERAL REVIEW SAD KIDDIES YOU CAN'T PUMP AS MUCH WATER AS YOU WANT TO WE CAN LIKE ALLOW YOU TO PUMP IS STABLE RATE BUT NOT THE AMOUNT THAT YOU WANT TO BECAUSE IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE IT'S GROUND WATER MINING. AND THE DIFFERENCE AS CENTER ROSS EXPLAINED WAS STAGGERING -- AND SO FAST FOR TO OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL -- THE KIDDIES COMPANY STILL HAD A MAJOR ROADBLOCK WITH OUR FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION -- THEY SOUGHT AN EXEMPTION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAID NOW. DO THESE NEVER INITIATED THE FEDERAL REVIEW THAT WAS REQUIRED THE INSTEAD WAITED FOR THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION. AND THEY GOT EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEEDED -- KIDDIES IS FORMER -- LOBBYIST AND REPRESENTATIVE JOIN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TRANSITION TEAM -- AND THAT TEAM MIRACULOUSLY CALLED THE KIDDIES PROJECT OUR NATION'S NUMBER FIFTEEN NATIONAL. EMERGENCY AND SECURITY PROJECT -- IN THE IN THE COUNTRY AND THE IN THE IN NEED A FAST TRACKING -- WITHIN MONTHS THAT -- IN MINISTRATION REMOVED THE SAFEGUARDS SB THREE OH SEVEN SIMPLY PUT SINCE OUR REVIEW BACK INTO PLACE. THAT SAID NOTHING MORE WE NEED THIS BECAUSE THE RULES AND THE PROCESS FEES ARE IMPORTANT THEY MEAN SOMETHING WE RESPECT YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU SIR. GOOD MORNING. CHAIR STERN AND SENATORS MY NAME IS MICHAEL MADRIGAL MEMBER OF THE CALL WE A BAND OF INDIANS. AND HERE TODAY AS PRESIDENT OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN LAND CONSERVANCY OR IN A LC. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB THREE OH SEVEN WHICH WILL PROTECT THE CALIFORNIA DESERT AND ITS IMMENSE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE. FOR THE PEOPLES WHO HAVE CALLED THIS REGION HOME SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. NALC IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOCUSING ON THE TRADITIONAL HOMELANDS OF TRIBES IN PRESENT DAY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE RESTORE SACRED SITES AND PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING FOR NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR UP FRONT IF WE DO NOT GET THIS RIGHT. IF WE ALLOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S RECKLESS DE REGULATION TO STAND THE CONTINUES GROUNDWATER MINING PROJECT WILL PERMANENTLY DESTROY OUR CULTURAL SITES AND SACRED LANDSCAPES. THIS LEGISLATURE EACH ONE OF YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE. WILL DETERMINE THE PATH TAKEN. THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER THE URGENCY FOR SB THREE OH SEVEN COULD NOT BE GREATER. THIS IS WHY THE NLC STANDS IN SOLIDARITY WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND ASSOCIATIONS THAT HAVE CALLED FOR THIS-LEGISLATION. INCLUDING THE TRIBAL ALLIANCE OF SOVEREIGN INDIAN NATIONS. NALC RECOGNIZES AND ALWAYS BRINGS FORWARD THE NECESSARY ROLE OF GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION WITH CALIFORNIANS AMERICAN INDIAN NATIONS. EVERY SPRING RIVER SEEP IN ANCIENT WELL IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO US FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. TODAY JUST LIKE MANY YEARS AGO DESERT SPRINGS ARE CRUCIAL TO OUR WAY OF LIFE AS TRADITIONAL GATHERING PLACES SACRED SITES FOR PRAYER AND CEREMONY. AS PLACES TO REST AND RESTORE OURSELVES. AS CALIFORNIA'S INDIGENOUS PEOPLES WE ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO TO THE NATURAL LANDSCAPE. THE PLANTS ANIMALS AIR AND WATER OF CALIFORNIA'S DESERTS. THE CHOICE BEFORE EACH OF YOU IS CLEAR SUPPORT SB THREE OH SEVEN AND RESTORE THE RESPONSIBLE SAFEGUARDS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY OF BEEN AFFORDED TO OUR HOMELAND. VOTE OTHERWISE AND KNOW THAT YOU ARE THREATENING THE EXISTENCE OF RESOURCES THAT TRIBAL PEOPLES DEPEND ON FOR OUR CULTURAL SURVIVAL. THE SAYING WATER IS LIFE IS TRUE IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT ACID IS AT STANDING ROCK. THIS IS WHY WE THE DESERT TRIBES SUPPOSED TO CONDUCE PROJECT IT DOES NOT SAVE A DROP OF WATER FOR OUR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN. AND SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF SB. THREE OH SEVEN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. PLEASE COME FOR NAME AND AFFILIATION. GOOD MORNING CAM DELFINO WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN SUPPORT JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE AQUIFER UNDERLYING THE KEYS VALLEY IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. TO PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WHILE I WAS ACTUALLY TRACKED GPS TRACK BUT MORE SHEEP WHICH ARE PROTECTED SPECIES THAT USE BORREGO I MEAN BRENT BONANZA SPRINGS -- AS A CRITICAL WATERING POINT OUR STATE IS INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN BRINGING THE SPECIES BACK WERE VERY. CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACTS TO WILDLIFE AND I WOULD JUST SIMPLY NOTE THAT -- THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT SEQUEL -- IT IS NOT ABOUT WHEELING STATUTES IT'S ABOUT ESTABLISHING AN ENVIRONMENT RE ESTABLISHING AN ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE THAT HAD BEEN IN PLACE BEFORE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE. AND REQUIRING THIS PROJECT TO GO THROUGH AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IT SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH AND SHOULD GO THROUGH. THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERALL POLICY AN ATTIC IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO STEP ASIDE AND LET THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ROLL BACK ENVIRONMENTAL. REVIEW AND TO PROTECTIONS AS WE JUST DISCUSSED WITH SB ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE SELLER GONZALEZ WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND WE ARE IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT AND WHAT ARE LINE OUR COMMENTS WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE THANK YOU. MELISSA ROMERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL IN STRONG SUPPORT OF PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S DESERTS. I ALSO WAS ASKED TO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY A CIVIL AND OUT OF ON CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS LAND TRITON REPRESENT A NEXT GEN CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR BILL GAINES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE WILD SHEEP FOUNDATION IN STRONG SUPPORT. BILL ALLEY -- FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP IN SUPPORT. EXCERPTED. WHEN I THINK IN THE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT? THANK YOU MA'AM. AND ALSO WE HAVE A CYNICAL CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT YOU. TRACY WENT ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN STRONG SUPPORT THANKS. MR TURN MEMBER SYLVIA'S SILLY SHAUN BEHALF OF CITY OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI IN STRONG SUPPORT THINGS ARE GOOD THANK YOU. SUSAN TEASING FORMER TRIBAL COUNCIL MEMBER OF MORE TELL RANCHERIA. OF CON CALL MY DO INDIANS WE ARE A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE THOSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAY UP. THANK YOU GUYS. ALRIGHT WE'LL DO. TWO POINT FIVE MINUTES EACH SINCE I GAVE THE OTHERS THE ONLY WAY. TO SO VERY GOOD GERMAN. ALWAYS FAIR THANK YOU. OF MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M JOE LÃNG REPRESENTING CAN DISS AND WITH ME TO ASSIST IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS IS MISTER SCOTT SLATER THE CEO OF COMMITTEES. YEAH I THINK MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY RAISES THE RIGHT QUESTION. IT RAISES THE QUESTION. WHAT WHAT IS THIS BILL ABOUT WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL? ON ONE HAND IS IT POTENTIALLY AS I BELIEVE MANY OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL WOULD SAY. TO ESSENTIALLY THROW WHATEVER ROADBLOCK COULD BE PUT IN FRONT OF THIS PROJECT IN AN EFFORT TO DEFEAT THE PROJECT SO IT NEVER OCCURS. OR IS IT I BELIEVE AS AS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL WOULD ARTICULATE IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY AND FIND A WAY TO RECONCILE. THE DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC REPORTS THAT HAVE COME OUT REGARDING THE PROJECT. THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE PURPOSE. THE SUPPORTERS HERE. BEFORE YOU TODAY WHO HOLD THE SEAT WERE. PROCESS AS THE GOLD STANDARD. FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. ARE THE SAME SUPPORTERS BEFORE YOU TODAY EVEN THOUGH THIS PROJECT HAS GONE THROUGH THE SEQUEL PROCESS. A SEQUEL PROCESSES THAT INVOLVED OVER TWENTY STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. THEY'RE HERE TODAY SUPPORTING THE BILL BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE OUTCOME OF THAT PROCESS THEY WANT TO RAISE THE BAR HIGHER BECAUSE THAT GOLD STANDARD THAT THEY HOLD DIDN'T RESULT IN THE OUTCOME THAT THEY WANTED TO ACHIEVE. IN ADDITION TO THOSE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES THAT WERE INVOLVED THE COUNTY SAMBAR DINO WAS NOT. THE LEAD AGENCY IN THE SEQUEL PROCESS SO THEY ACTUALLY LAYERED ON TOP OF THAT REVIEW. THEIR OWN SPECIFIC INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF BOTH THE SCIENCE IN THE OPERATION. A VERY THOROUGH VETTING A VERY EXHAUSTIVE VETTING. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE THE COUNTY WAS REALLY INDEPENDENT FROM THE SEQUEL PROCESS. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SCOPE FOR JUST A MINUTE WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT. IT'S POTENTIALLY FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET A YEAR. THAT'S FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET COMPARED TO THE VOLUME OF AT LEAST TWENTY MILLION ACRE FEET THAT IS ESTIMATED TO BE IN THIS AQUIFER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LESS THAN 1% A YEAR BACK LESS THAN ONE HALF PERCENT A YEAR. COMPARE THAT TO SOME OF THE OTHER GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT BASINS THAT HAVE OVER DRAFTED VERY SIX SIGNIFICANTLY AND YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND. THE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT IS QUITE SMALL. I'D ALSO LIKE TO CORRECT ONE THING THAT WAS THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY DID APPROVE THIS PROJECT IT WAS REVIEWED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WAS APPROVED. HAVING SAID THAT AND UNDERSTANDING THE AUTHOR'S DESIRE TO HAVE A REVIEW OR RECONCILIATION OF OF THE SCIENCE BEHIND THIS PROJECT. WE DID SERIOUSLY PROVIDE OF AN OFFER OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE AUTHOR. THAT WOULD DO TWO THINGS. ONE IT WOULD ALLOW AND BRING INTO THE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE PROJECT. THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AS A PARTNER IN THAT. PLAN. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE W. R. TO BOTH REVIEW. THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. FOR THE PROJECT PRIOR TO ANY WATER TRANSFERS. BUT EVEN IN ADDITION AND GOING WAY BEYOND THAT GIVING THEM AN ONGOING ROLE FOR THE FIFTY YEARS OF THE PROJECT IN BOTH REVIEWING ALL OF THE MONITORING RESULTS THAT OCCUR. AND GIVING THEM THE ABILITY. TOO TO WEIGH IN AS AN EQUAL PARTNER ABOUT THE SCIENCE. OF WE THINK THAT THAT WAS A REALLY BEYOND JUST RECONCILING THE SCIENCE OF MAKING SURE THE PROJECT OPERATED PROPERLY. BUT HAVING THE DEPARTMENT IN THAT PROCESS ALL ALONG THE WAY IT'S AN EQUAL PARTNER WE THINK THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED IN A PROJECT LIKE THIS. SO WHY ARE WE OPPOSE THE BILL A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION HAD AN OPPORTUNITY IN FACT WAS INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SEQUEL PROCESS TO PROVIDE COMMENTS ON THE PROJECT. TO EXPRESS ANY CONCERNS THAT THEY HAD. THE REALITY IS THEY CHOSE NOT. TO NOW THIS BILL WANTS TO GIVE THEM THE PRIMARY ROLE IN REVIEWING THE PROJECT ONE MORE TIME WHEN THEY HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY AND DIDN'T TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY IN THE SEQUEL PROCESS. SECONDLY THERE'S NO SPECIFIC PROCESS IN THIS BILL. BILL LANGUAGE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVE A NEGATIVE. TO PROVE THAT IN FACT THERE WOULD BE NO ADVERSE IMPACT. NOT ONLY IS THAT DIFFICULT TO DO BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE THERE'S NO ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS SPELLED OUT IN THE BILL. IT ACTUALLY WOULD ALLOW THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION EVEN IF THE SCIENCE WERE BORN OUT TO BE. SAFE AND NOT PROVIDE ANY. UNDESIRABLE RESULTS THE COMMISSION MEMBERS THEMSELVES COULD SIMPLY VOTE TO REJECT THE PROJECT EVEN IF THE SCIENCE IS BORN OUT. BECAUSE OF THAT DISCRETION BECAUSE THERE'S NO PROCESS. WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL NOW WE HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR WE RECOGNIZE. HIS WELL INTENTIONED APPROACH AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO TO TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO GET TO THAT PLACE WHERE THE SCIENCE ANSWERS CAN BE. PROVIDED TO THE AUTHOR IT AT THE SAME TIME NOT RECREATE THE WILL FOR THE PROJECT A GOOD THANK YOU I'M GONNA TREAT THAT AS A TWO AND A HALF MINUTES TIMES TO WHICH WAS FIVE MINUTES. I WOULD ASSUME YOU OPPOSE THE BILL MR SLATER. YES OKAY. I'M HERE TO ANSWER WHATEVER I YEAH SO THE I. QUESTIONS BUT WE'RE GONNA DOIS. I'M GO TO THE REST OPPOSITION TO MAYBE WILL COME BACK TO IF THEY'RE FOR THE QUESTION. NAME AN AFFILIATION IF YOU COULD MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KITTANI DURAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL LABORS IN OPPOSITION WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL SUCH A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT THAT COULD. POTENTIALLY HALL R DELAYED OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH THE SECRET PROCESS. WHETHER IT'S ADDITIONAL UNITS TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS OR OTHER INVESTIGATIONAL DO WIN THROUGH THAT BUT THANK YOU YEAH. UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING NOVEL TO ADD JUST PLEASE TRY TO STICK. TO GENTLY SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT WHERE THE LEAD AGENCY ON THE PROJECT WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE BILL OKAY THANK YOU SIR. THERE IS THE RISK THIS BILL WATER DISTRICT OF ORANGE COUNTY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS ALLEN CAN UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES OPPOSED AGAIN JUST FOR THE PRESIDENT THAT THIS BILL WOULD SET. OKAY THANK YOU SIR. GOOD MORNING TO RIGHT RIGHT POLICY MANAGER LA COUNTY BUSINESS FEDERATION OPPOSITION THIS IS LIKE. LUCY MOVING THE FOOTBALL IN PEANUTS. THANK YOU SIR. CHRISSY FOR ON BEHALF OF THREE VALLEY'S MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ATTY MUNSON ON BEHALF OF THE AND WHEN EMPIRE UTILITIES AGENCY EYELINER COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF AQUA IN OPPOSITION VERY GOOD THANK YOU. STEVE KERR'S FOR THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION THANKS SIR. KRISTIN OLSON WITH THE PROTECT WATER IN JOBS COALITION A GROUP OF FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH. RENDON PENSACOLA FERREIRA CONSTRUCTION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP FOR JOBS WERE VISITING -- NINETY THOUSAND UNION EMPLOYEES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY CONTRACTORS THANK IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GREGORY FOSTER WITH ENGINEERING CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. MORNING MR TURN SENATORS ROSANNA CARVE OUT TO HEAR ME OFF OF THE TIDEWATER DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA GROUNDWATER COALITION IN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING -- SENATOR STERN. AND COMMITTEE CAN MY NAME IS TIM PARKER AND I'M REPRESENTING THE GROUND WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA. I'M ALSO ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS. THAT REVIEWED A LOT OF THE REPORTS -- INVOLVED WITH THIS PROJECT YOU MAY THINK IT'S A LITTLE ODD FOR D. R. RATED TO OPPOSE SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT WE KIND OF FELT IT -- WOULD. POTENTIALLY SET SOME. PRECEDENTS ON CONVEYANCE OF CONSTRAINTS. AND ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT AND REVIEW OF PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY -- PRETTY WELL REVIEWED UNDER SYKORA. AT A TIME WITH SIGMUND PLACE WHEN WE'VE GOT ALL THESE BASINS THAT ARE OVER DRAFTED AND NEED WATER IN THE FUTURE. AND WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE CALLS EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE TO TRY. TO MEET THOSE TWENTY YEAR CONSTRAINTS IN THE FUTURE SO THAT'S WHY WE OPPOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DÃ­AS MEMBERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] HUESO. JUST GENERALLY I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT IN A LIVE. THIS IS A REALLY TOUGH BILL THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE AND HONESTLY I MEAN AND AND REVIEWING THIS IS EASY. TO GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND BUT OVERALL THE WAY WE'VE DONE ON LEAVE WE HADN'T BEEN GOING OVER THIS BILL FOR YEARS NOW. AND THAT WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY LOOK AT EVERYTHING THIS FOR THIS PROJECT HAS GONE THROUGH AND I I JUST THINK OF THAT. THE THE PROPONENTS OF THIS PROJECT OF GONE THROUGH. EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS INCLUDING NEW LAWS THAT WE HAVE PASSED IN THAT PROCESS THAT REQUIRE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT SO. WENT WHEN THEIR CONCERNS ARE REYES SAID THERE'S A GROUND. WATER MANAGEMENT CONCERNED I'M VERY SKEPTICAL BECAUSE OF THE STRICT MEASURES WE'VE PUT IN CALIFORNIA THAT. ARE INTENDED TO PER PROTECT PROTECT OUR AQUIFER'S AND KEEP THEM -- KEEP THEM OF SUSTAINABLE. AND I DON'T BELIEVE I MEAN THERE THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF OVER DRAWING OF WATER RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE OF THAT HAVE REDUCED OUR AQUIFER'S TO DANGEROUS LEVELS AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS. ONE THAT WITH THE CURRENT. SEE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE ARE THREAT OF THAT. BUT I I AGREE THAT -- THE THE PROPONENTS OF THE PROJECT THE GONE THROUGH EVERY STEP. HAVE HAVE GONE THROUGH A VERY RIGOROUS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS AND THEY HAVE MET EVERY REQUIREMENTS. AND IT'S A IT'S A TOUGH THING TO DO -- IT WOULD BE UNJUST AND WE WOULDN'T BE DOING OUR JOBS IF WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THE GOAL POST. IN THAT PROCESS. AND AND NO I I THINK THIS BILL ISN'T UNNECESSARY THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH LAWS THAT WOULD HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKING SURE THAT THIS [inaudible] BOB PROJECT. DOES NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT AND IF THERE ARE IMPACTS AT THEIR MEDICATED AND I SEE. SOME ARGUMENTS INCLUDING ONES THAT THIS MAY REDUCE THE SALINITY OF THE SOFT FOR OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. THAT I THINK IS TO VISIT IS A POSITIVE THING CAN HAPPEN FROM THIS BUT GENERALLY -- MUSTAPHA THE BILL TODAY -- SENATOR. SIMPLY BECAUSE I THINK THERE ENOUGH CONTROLS IN PLACE THAT GOVERN THIS SPECIFIC SITE AND I I JUST FIND IT HARD TO TAKE A POSITION HERE ON THIS THAT WOULD -- PUNISH SOMEBODY THAT HAS GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND SPENT. A NORMA SAMANA MONEY DOING THAT AND BECAUSE IT WOULD IT WOULD IT WOULD SET A DIFFERENT THEY'VE. A VERY BAD PRECEDENT AND IF WE ARE PURSUING PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE IN THE STATE. THEN AND THIS IS THE WAY WE DEAL WITH THEM I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO EVER. DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL PROJECT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT I THINK SHOULD CONCERN US ALL. THERE WAS A READY TO THE VICE CHAIR THAN CENTER BOARD IS THE WILL COME BACK OVER. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN NEXT THANK YOU MISTER MANAGEMENT OF TELLING A COUPLE COMMENTS -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO MENTIONED AND GET TO IS A COUPLE SPECIFIC POINTS -- MISTER LANG OR YOU OR THE YOUR WITNESS. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS SENDING SAN BENITO COUNTY I HAD A ROLE IN THE PROJECT AND YOU KNOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT WHAT THEIR ROLE IS AND WHAT POWER OVERSIGHT. AND I HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR THE AUTHORS AND MISTER. YES. MISTER MEMBERS OF THE COULD AT THE COMMITTEE THE ROLE THE SAME YOU KNOW COUNTY WAS SAID THAT -- FOLLOWING THE THE CONSIDERATION OF THE PROJECT IN TWO THOUSAND THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT CLAIMS STATUTORY IMMUNITY FROM ANY LOCAL REGULATION BY THE COUNTY. IN RESPONSE THE COUNTY ADOPTED A A INDEPENDENT GRANT DESERT GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE. WHICH REQUIRED COMPLIANCE EITHER BY DIRECT COMPLIANCE OR SUBMITTING A GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN WHICH WOULD BE APPROVED BY THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. SANTA MARGARITA AGREED TO WAIVE ANY STATUTORY IMMUNITY FROM THAT REGULATION AND THE COUNTY SET UPON ITS OWN INDEPENDENT. REVIEW OF THE THE E. I. R. AND OF THE PROJECT ULTIMATELY IT HELD. I THINK AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN I HEARINGS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TESTIFIED IT HAD ITS OWN EMPLOY TECHNICAL EXPERT A GENTLEMAN HERE FROM. THE SACRAMENTO AREA NOTICED JUST COMPANIES QUITE -- IN AND WILL HOW AGAIN WHO ARE BOTH RENOWNED -- HYDROGEL JUST SAID THE LAWYER WAS KEVIN O'BRIEN -- THEY NOT ONLY REVIEW THE PROJECT AND FOUND -- THAT THERE WOULD BE NO UNDESIRABLE RESULTS WHICH IS THE SIGMA STANDARD THAT THE YIELD WAS SUSTAINABLE. AND THEY ALSO DID SOMETHING WHICHWAS VERY NOVEL OF THE COUNTY IMPOSED WHAT ARE CALLED AREA OF ORIGIN PROTECTIONS. FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COUNTY SO THAT THEY LIMITED THE TERM OF THE PROJECT TO FIFTY YEARS AND AT THE END OF THE FIFTY YEAR PERIOD THEY ENABLE TO RE SHUFFLING THE DECK. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW HOW THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT THE STATE WATER PROJECT WORK THEIR BURDEN BY SOMETHING CALLED THE STE THE AREA OF ORIGIN COUNTY OF ORIGIN RESTRICTIONS. THEYIMPOSE THAT ON THE PROJECT WHICH MEANS THAT THE INTO THE FIFTY YEAR PERIOD. USES WITHIN THE COUNTY WOULD HAVE PRIORITY THE WATER FROM THE PROJECT. ESTABLISH A LIFELINE A DEDICATION FROM -- KIDDIES WHICH WERE WHERE THE KIDDIES WOULD GRANT TWENTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER TO THE COUNTY TO USE IN ITS DISCRETION FOR USES INSIDE THE COUNTY. AND THEY ALSO INCLUDED A CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT SAID EVEN IF RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES AND SAN MARINO COUNTY DON'T WANT TO WATER NOW THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT INTO INTO IT T A LATER DATE. AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE IS THE ONLY GROUND WATER MANSION PLAN IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S INCLUDED THOSE PROVISIONS. MR ROTH TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT YOU KNOW THE COURTS HAVE RULED ON THIS. NUMBER AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HAS. SOME STRONG PROTECTIONS ON IT. HI INCLUDING OF IN ON THE FLOOR ESTABLISHED BY THE COUNTY THE COURTS HAVE UPHELD THE COUNTIES GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN WE GOT SEGMENT AS IS BEEN MENTIONED -- D. W. R. HAS BEEN MENTIONED AS AN AS AN OPTION -- TO OVERSEE. AND YOU'VE STATED THAT YOU'RE JUST LOOKING FOR A PEN ASSESSMENT THE SCIENCE. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME IN AND I I THINK MY AGAIN MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANDIEGO -- ADEQUATELY -- MENTION THIS AS WELL -- IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S OCCURRED. AND IT SEEMS LIKE A STRETCH THAT OUR COURTS. ARE NOT. TRUSTWORTHY WHEN FACING QUESTIONS OF THE STATE'S RESOURCES AND WE WE TRUST THE COURTS A LOT. IN ON THESE KIND OF ISSUES AND THE SCIENCE. HAS UNDERTAKEN WOULD YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO YOU KNOW THOSE COMMENTS [inaudible] WELL SURE. IN THE FIRST PLACE THE COMMENTS THE OF COULD DISS COMMENTS. IGNORE THE FINAL REASON THAT I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS BILL I'M NOT KNOWN AS AN ENVIRONMENTALIST I DON'T THINK I'VE TOUCHED A WATER ISSUE IN THE SIX PLUS YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE. BUT I'M BOTHERED BY THE FACT THAT THERE IS A AT LEAST A FORTY THOUSAND ACRE FOOT WHICH IS FOURTEEN BILLION GALLONS. FORTY THOUSAND ACRE FOOT DISCREPANCY IN THE SCIENCES TO WHAT CAN BE PULLED OUT OF THIS BASIN. NO. THE INITIAL COMMENT BY THE KIDDIES WAS THAT SUPPORTERS ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH SEEK WERE. ROSS THE COURTS HAVE RULED OF AN ANSWER QUESTIONS AND YEAH BUT I I MEAN I I THINK THE COURTS OF THE COULD DIS. DOES NOT RESOLVE SCIENCE I READ A QUOTE FROM THE APPELLATE DECISION IN THE COULD DIS APPEAL WHERE THE COURT SAID WE DO NOT RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN THE SCIENCE. THE STANDARD IS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WE LOOK TO SEE IF THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WHICH IS ANY REASONABLE F.. EVIDENCE AND THE INFERENCES THAT CAN BE DRAWN THEREFROM TO SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION OF THE LEAD AGENCY. EVEN IN THE FACE OF MORE COMPELLING. EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD SO THERE'S NO RESOLUTION AND THE PROBLEM HERE THE BASIC PROBLEM HERE. IS. THIS IN THE NORMAL COULD SEE FOR PROCESS. YOU HAVE A LEAD AGENCY THAT ACTS IN A RATHER OBJECTIVE WAY. YOU SELECT EXPERTS YOU EVALUATE THE SCIENCE YOU IS THE LEAD AGENCY RESOLVE THE CONFLICTS. YOU THEN SUBMIT YOUR FINAL E. I. ARE OU APPROVE IT IT MAY BE CHALLENGED IN COURT AND THEN THE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TEST APPLIES. IN THIS CASE THERE WAS AN INITIAL TUSSLE. IN COURT BETWEEN THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO. AND THE SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT AS TO CENTIMETER MARGARITAS DESIRE TO BE THE LEAD AGENCY SAN BERNARDINO THE COUNTY WHERE THE PROJECT IS LOCATED. WANTED TO BE THE LEAD AGENCY IN THE END OF THE DAY SANTA MARIA MARGARITA WHICH HAS NO GROUND WATER. AND HAS A THIRTY PER IS A LARGEST. INTEREST IN THE PUMPING PROJECT WITH THE 30% WATER INTEREST. WAS THE LEAD AGENCY SO THE LEAD AGENCY IN THE SEQUEL PROCESS GETS TO PICK THE AXE. AND I'VE HEARD MANY AN EXPERT IN FORTY FIVE YEARS AS IT DOES OF LITIGATION ATTORNEY AND YOU NEVER HER AN EXPERT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS GONNA BE. SO THE SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT HIRES THE EXPERT PUTS THE EVIDENCE IN THE E. I. R. WHEN THE IRISH CHALLENGED IN THE COURTS UNDER THE SEEK WITH STANDARD. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THE COURT LOOKS TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE IN THE E. I. R. REPORT THAT SOME SORTS SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSION AND IF THERE IS. THAT'S THE END OF THE CONVERSATION SO WHEN YOU SAY COURTS REVIEW THERE WAS NO COURT EVALUATION AND VALIDATION OF THE PARTICULAR SCIENCE HERE. I'M NOT TRYING TO STOP THE PROJECT. I'M TRYING TO RESOLVE THE SCIENCE BECAUSE IF WE GET THIS WRONG. EVEN UNDER COULD DISS VIEW IT'S GOING TO TAKE THIRTY YEARS TO RECHARGE THE AQUIFER RESTORE THE AQUIFER AND IN THE IN THE OPINION OF SOME SCIENTISTS. THAT THIRTY YEARS GOES TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS SO I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO THE BACK AND REVIEW THAT MY COLLEAGUES HERE. MY FRIENDS ARE ARE PROPOSING WE NEED TO DO THE FRONT AND REVIEW AND WITH RESPECT TO THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY GRAND WATER GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT MONITORING PLAN. THEIR FIVE YEAR REPORTS THERE'S-A TECHNICAL COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF THREE THE COUNTY SANTA. MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT IN A THIRD PARTY THAT THEY PICK. THE TEN REVIEWS WHAT THEY CALL ACTION CRITERIA AND IF THERE ACTION CRITERIA THAT OCCUR WHICH IS A DECLINE IN THE STATIC WATER LEVELS. THEN THERE'S THIRTY DAYS AND SIXTY DAYS AN APPEALS IN THIS THAT THE OTHER. AND IF WE GET IT WRONG AND THE WATER LEVEL IN THE BONANZA SPRINGS GOES AWAY. THAT WILL HAVE. PERMANENT LASTING EFFECTS ON BIGHORN SHEEP THE VEGETATION AND THE AND THE WILDLIFE AND THE FUN AND THE FLOOR AND THE MOJAVE DESERT AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT. THANK YOU. IS THERE -- AND IF YOU WANT TO GIVE THE OPPONENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS -- WHY DON'T WE JUST TO MAYBE CENTER BOARD JUST WANT TO JUMP IN AND WE CAN FLESH THIS OUT IF? YOU HAVE FURTHER COMMENTS. THIS IS KIND OF REFER THIS ISSUE AND FORGIVE ME FOR A BABY BEING L. CALLOUS -- REMINDS ME OF AN INFOMERCIAL. YOU KNOW THAT SAYS IF YOU BUY THIS WIDGET. AWFULLY -- THIRTY NINE NINETY FIVE YOU CAN GET SO MUCH MORE BUT WAIT THERE'S EVEN MORE. THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I SEE THIS THE C. QUOTE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS PLAYING OUT. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND I THINK IT WAS STATED EARLIER THAT SOMETIMES -- WHEN FOLKS ADVOCATE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION IN APPLICATION OF SYKORA -- WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN IS TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OUTCOME? IT IS NOT. EARLY ON SCIENCE OR CONCERN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BUT TO ACHIEVE A POLITICAL OUTCOME. AND SO I GUESS WHAT I'M WHAT I'M WONDERING TODAY IS. WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY -- A PASSIONATE TESTIMONY OF FOLKS THAT DO NOT WANT THIS PROJECT TO MOVE FORWARD AND WE'VE HEARD MERITORIOUS ALSO MERITORIOUS COMMENTARY. OF FROM -- PROPONENTS THAT -- I BELIEVE -- SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO MOVE FORWARD HAVING JUMP THROUGH EVERY A RELEVANT APPLICABLE WHO. ONE SAN DIEGO EVEN -- ATTESTED TO TO SUCH. I'M KIND OF THE OPINION THAT. SOUND MINDS CAN CAN REACH CONSENSUS AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE INTELLECTUALLY HONEST AND PRAGMATIC ABOUT THINGS. IS THERE A PATH FORWARD HERE. FOR A A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR EXAMPLE YOU SAY THAT. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE THE WATER EXTRACTION COULD BE CATASTROPHIC. I'VE I'M I'M AWARE THAT THERE IS -- A PROPOSAL -- OR AT LEAST ONE COMPONENT IS THAT -- PUMPING WHICH SEES IF IT DIPS BELOW EIGHTY FEET -- MAYBE YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M MISTAKEN ABOUT THAT. BUT THERE ARE SAFE IS THAT A SAFEGUARD THAT IS BUILT IN THERE YES OR NO PLEASE YES. SO I THINK WHEN WE HAVE A SAFE CORD LIKE THAT THAT BUILDS CONFIDENCE. NOW I'M WONDERING IS THERE ANY OTHER PROPOSAL THAT. HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD OR BABY HAS YET TO BE PUT FOR NOW YOU'LL MY TIME IN THAT REGARD. THAT -- CAN LOOK AFTER THE ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS. AND CREATE THE SAFEGUARDS IT SHOULD THERE BE. SCIENTIFICALLY DEMONSTRABLE -- EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS -- I'D DAMAGE BEING DONE TO THE ENVIRONMENT OR LIKELY DAMAGE TO INTO. THAT THERE BE US THAT THERE BE -- REVERSAL OF COURSE OPPORTUNITIES SO MAYBE WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR OTHER ANY IDEAS -- THAT COULD BE PUT FORWARD. ABOUT MY COLLEAGUES. YOU WANT ME TO RESPOND IN IDEAS I THINK IT'S A CALL IS IN OUR CITY FOR IDEAS. ABOUT. AS SENATOR. YOUR BILL WELL MISTER. WELL FIRST OF ALL A MAYBE MISTER SLATER COULD POINTED OUT TO ME BUT I HAVEN'T FOUND IT IN THE SAND WATER IN THE SENATE IN A GROW WATER MANAGEMENT MONITORING PLAN. THERE'S A REFERENCE TO EIGHTY FEET BUT THAT THERE'S NOT LANGUAGE ABOUT A HARD STOP THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE LOOKS AT THE ACTION CRITERIA AND THERE'S A PROCESS BY WHICH THE COMMITTEE REVIEWS AND ANALYZES -- THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF MY READ OF THE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING PLAN I DIDN'T DRAFTED SO. OF WHAT PERHAPS I WILL DEFER OF THOSE WHO DID. OF LET ME ADDRESS THE ISSUE ABOUT ALTERNATIVES -- I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO CONVERSATION FRANKLY IF YOU KNOW I CAME TO THIS THING AT THE END OF AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND BETWEEN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND AND CERTAINLY TILL THE END OF LAST WEEK -- OF I'VE HAD VERY LITTLE CONVERSATION -- WITH THE KIDDIES PROPONENTS ABOUT WHAT I WHAT BROUGHT ME TO THE TABLE WHICH IS THE FRONT AND THE VLUATION. AND ASSESSMENT AND SETTING OF AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE -- PUMPING RATE I'M NOT SATISFIED THAT THE GROW WATER MANAGEMENT MONITORING PLAN -- DOES THAT WITH ENOUGH -- AGILITY AND FLEXIBILITY TO CATCH ANY PROBLEMS AND EIGHTY FOUR DROP IN THE OXFORD IS FUNNY WATER IN THE AQUIFER THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE ISSUE THE ISSUE IS THE IMPACT. I AGREE I CAN'T EITHER THE ISSUE IS THE IMPACT TO THE BONANZA SPRINGS IN ANY OTHER SPRINGS THAT HAPPEN TO BE IN INTER CONNECTED WITH THE AQUIFER. THERE IS A SCIENTIFIC DISPUTE ABOUT HAVING TO DO WITH ICE OF ISOTOPES AN ANALYSIS OF WATER IN TEMPERATURE AND WE'RE AS TO WHETHER THOSE SPRINGS ARE INTERCONNECTED WHICH NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED BECAUSE IF THERE IS AN INTER CONNECTION. A DROP OF ONE TO TWO TO THREE TO SIX FEET IN FINANCES BRINGS COULD HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARILY DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON ON WILDLIFE AND THE AND THE VEGETATION. A COULD EASE -- AS I RECALL ADMITS IN SOME OF ITS OWN FILINGS THAT THE PUMPING WILL RESULT IN A IN A DROP OF OF SEVERAL FEET IN BONANZA SPRINGS. AT LEAST IN SOME OF THE FILINGS AND SO WE NEED TO RESOLVE THAT IN MY READY TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT ALL TO IT IS AS LONG AS IT INVOLVES THE FRONT END ASSESSMENT ABSOLUTELY -- AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE ON THE WAY TO LET ME AND LET ME JUST SEIZE ON THAT INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR IT TO GO THROUGH ITS NEST NEXT ITERATIONS OF VARIOUS COMMITTEES -- BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN IT SOMETIMES IT WORKS SOMETIMES IT IT DOESN'T. THESE PER GIVE ME FOR PUTTING ON THE ON THE ON THE SPOT HERE -- ARE YOU OPEN TO THE IDEA OF SOME SORT OF ANNUAL REVIEW -- YOU GET MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THERE WOULD BE -- ALLY A DIRECT -- TRUSTEE MEMBERSHIP ALLOWED -- FOR FOR EVERYBODY. I'M SORRY W. R. E. W. R. DOES THAT SEEM SATISFACTORY DO YOU TO ACTUALLY INVITE D. W.OR TO BE PART OF THIS THIS TRUSTEE GROUP THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT I'VE HAD WITH EVERY SINGLE CONVERSATION I'VE HAD WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF GOODIES. AND IT FOCUSES ON A BACK IN REVIEW. EITHER IMMEDIATELY PRESS PRETTY FRONT END OF MAY. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S SAYING SENATOR MOVEMENT MAYBE I DESTRUCTION SO WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH IF MISTER SLATER WILL COMMIT. TO A FRONT END REVIEW BY INDEPENDENT SCIENCE -- THAT'S DIFFERENT I'M TALKING ABOUT I'M DID NOT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A COMMISSION CONVENING TO ROUTE TO START A THROUGH Z. ALL OVER AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING I'M TALKING ABOUT IT. SOMETHING FAR MORE PRAGMATIC TOLD MISTER SLATER. AND HIS REPRESENTATIVES. THAT IF THEY WANT TO SET A TIME LINE FOR THIS LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW LONG IT TAKES IN SET A TIMELINE. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT RE DOING A SEQUEL REVIEW PROCESS. BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT RESOLVING SINCE VERY SERIOUS CONFLICTS IN THE IN THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE MISTER SLATER HAS AN INNOVATIVE THEORY HAVING TO DO WITH EVAPORATION IN THE MOJAVE DESERT IN AQUIFER'S IN. BACK FLOWS IN ALL OF IT TO CAPTURE OF ABERRATION TO TO COME UP WITH THE FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OTHER SCIENTISTS TO DATE. AS I READ THE REPORTS DO NOT SEEM TO AGREE NOW IF I'VE TOLD MISTER SLATER THAT IF HIS INNOVATIVE PROPOSAL HAVING TO DO WITH EVAPORATION SUCH AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. OF WATER DRAWING I DON'T THAT AQUIFER I'M ALL FOR THAT BUT IT NEEDS WE NEED TO HAVE SOME SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ON THAT POINT AND THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING FOR HERE IF THERE'S A WAY. TO TO TO MODIFY THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL IN A DIFFERENT FASHION TO MAKE. MISTER SLATER AND HIS COMPANY HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS. I'M HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH MISTER SLATER WITH GOODIES AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO WANTS TO COME TO THE TABLE ARE ALL AT ALL IN MY COMMENTS HERE AND WAIT FOR OTHERS -- TO JUMP IN BUT NORMALLY I'M I'M NOT KEEN ON NEGOTIATING FROM -- FROM THE DAIS -- SOMETIMES WHEN IT APPEARS IF THEY'RE EASY AMPLE -- OPPORTUNITIES FOR AN ACCOMMODATION AND CONSENTS TO BE CHEAP SOMETIMES IT'S WARRANTED I THINK IN THIS SITUATION THERE MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT I NEED TO HEAR IT FROM COULD THESE AND FROM THE MAKERS OF THE THE MOTION -- MR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES. SO TO BEGIN WITH A ARE GOOD FAITH INTENTION WAS. ATTEMPT. TO MEET US SENATOR ROSS CONCERNED ABOUT AN ADVANCE REVIEW AND ACTUALLY DO BETTER THAN THAT OUR INTENTION WAS TO INVITE D. W. R. INTO. A SHARED MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY WHICH GAVE THEM THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LONG. REVIEW. WHICH INCLUDES ANNUAL REVIEWS AND THEN FIVE YOU'RE REQUIRED ADJUSTMENTS ON ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND THERE IS A RAMP IN PERIOD SO WOULD NOBODY'S DELIVERING WATER TOMORROW. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE SO THERE'S THERE THE INTENTION WAS IS THAT D. W. R. WOULD BE SET BE PUT INTO THAT MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY NOW. TODAY OR WHENEVER THIS BILL WAS EFFECTIVE IF AND IF NOT BEFORE SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY JUST TO FOCUS THE CONVERSATION I THINK. THE WHAT I HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR IS FRONT END. PRE REVIEW RATE SO WE'RE TIED I GUESS I APPRECIATE THE THE FLUSHING OUT WHAT AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT PLAN WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I THINK WITH CENTER BOARD IS GETTING AT WAS SENATE ROTH IS GETTING AS THE FRONT END SO WHAT'S THE AND SO. THE PAIN HAVING SPENT SOME TIME -- THIS RECENTLY AS THIS MORNING WAS SENATOR ROTH. I THINK THAT. AGAIN OUR INTENTION WOULD BE. D. W. R. WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY ENABLED TO BEGIN REVIEWING ANYTHING I WANTED BUT BUT HE WOULD BE MY TO JUST. JUMP TO THE POINT. THE THE THE PRIMARY CONCERN IS IS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE PROJECT INTERFERE WITH THE SPRINGS IN THE ADJACENT WATERSHED. IT'S NOT ABOUT WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHETHER THE PUMPING RAY ARE THAT RECHARGE RATE IS THIRTY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED OR NINETEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED IT'S REALLY WHETHER THAT THE CONSEQUENCES. WILL CAUSE AN IMPACT IN THE SPECIFIC IMPACT OF CONCERN IN THIS IN THIS WATERSHED IS FIRST AND FOREMOST SORT OF THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE. THE DEMANDS OF SPRING IN THE POTENTIAL THAT WOULD -- WOULD HARM OTHER -- SPRINGS IN THE HIGHER UP IN THE WATERSHED SO FIRST OF ALL THE INTENTION I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD BE WILLING AS A PART OF THE NOTION OF INTRODUCING D. W. R. INTO THE TRUSTEE ROLE. TO DO A A AND NOW. ASSESSMENT OF THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE THE ALLUVIAL AQUIFER WERE PUMPING FROM IN THE SPRING WE WE WILLING TO DO THAT TODAY. THAT'S THE FIRST PIECE BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE E. I. ARE ALREADY. DID TWO THINGS IT CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WASN'T A HYDRAULIC CONNECTION. BUT THEN FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT MODEL WHAT THE IMPACTS WOULD BE INCLUDED THAT THEY WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THEY WERE THE AT VARIATION WITHIN THE BAND WITH THE WHAT HAPPENS NATURALLY. SO THAT WAS IN THE AYE ARE IN I ALSO WANT TO SAY THE COUNTY LOOK AT THAT TO THE COUNTY WAS NOT BOUND BY THE I. R. AND THE TRIAL COURT. REVIEW THAT FINDING SO IN THE END WE WOULD AGREE TO THAT FOCUS STUDY. NOW. FOR YOU WANNA JUMP INTO THIS AND I'LL COME BACK TO CENTER JACKSON. I DO. ON THE I JUST WONDER WAS THAT A YES OR NO. TO THE PROPOSAL OF DOING ADVANCE I APOLOGIZE CENTERS BUT BUT IN IT IS SORT OF THE FINAL CONCLUSION TO THAT CONVERSATION I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A FINAL CONCLUSION YET TO THAT COVERS ALL RIGHT OKAY I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS WE COULD MOVE ALONG. NOT YEAH WE'RE GETTING THERE. DID BY BIT. NO IT'S OKAY -- COUPLE COMMENTS A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS BASED UPON THE SENATORS GOOD THE PRICE YOUR FIRST. I AM IS CHAIRMAN. COMPELLED BY THE ARGUMENT THAT SOMEBODY WHO JUMP THROUGH ALL THE HOOPS. LITIGATE EVERYTHING AND WE COME AS A LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST DAY AND TRY TO CHANGE THE RULES IS WRONG. I SEEN IT IN OTHER BODIES AND I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN. IT IS A COMPELLING ARGUMENT. BUT FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE WHICH I THINK BECAUSE A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION. AND THE BECAUSE LOOK YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU GOTHROUGH ALL THIS STUFF AND WHAT'S THE POINT IF EVERY TIME THE GOVERNMENT CAN JUST SIMPLY CHANGE THE RULES THE END OF THE GAME. IT'S A FAIR QUESTION ON EITHER SIDE NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE HAVE TO JUDGE THESE THINGS YOU KNOW WE HAVE WAS IN THE STORE CONTEXT DEPENDING ON WHO'S IN POWER THERE'S A PROCESS AND RULE OF LAW WE SHOULD FOLLOW IT. BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS CASE ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE CRITICAL. ONE IS THAT ARMED. YOU KNOW THE THE LEAD AGENCY HAD A THUMB ON THE SCALE THEY HAD AN INTEREST IN THE DEAL. SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT HAD INTEREST AND THERE ARE TO ME. NO NO DISRESPECT TO THEM BUT IT'S JUST TO MAKE IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT FUNDAMENTAL IT'S LIKE CHANGING A CASE IN THE SUPREME COURT. THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO THE OUTCOME OF THE OF THE MATTER. AND YOU CAN'T IGNORE THAT IN TERMS OF HAVING AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW. WHAT SENATE ROTH INDICATED OF COURSES FIRING EXPERT WITNESSES YOU ALWAYS WANT THE OUTCOME AND I DON'T BLAME SOMEBODY FOR DOING THAT BUT THEIR OBLIGATION IS DIFFERENT THAN OURS ARE JOB IN THE GOVERNMENT? IS TO DEAL WITH THE TRUTH AND FAIRNESS OF PROCESS. BOB AND THE SECOND THING IS THE CLIMATE CHANGE ARGUMENT IN THE SENSE THAT THE SCIENCE IS SOUL FOR PARK. YOU DON'T FORTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET IS A LOT OF WATER I MEAN I IT'S A CITY OF WHAT. FORWARD FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT DENNIS AUTO IT'S A PRETTY BIG NUMBER IN TERMS OF WHAT THE DISTRICT NUMBERS ARE AND THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE SOCCER FOR THAT THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN AROUND FOR MANY YEARS ARE KEENLY AWARE OF SO. THE QUESTION IS FAIR I MEAN I THINK THAT THE CONSULTANT A MISTER CONNOR SAID CLEARLY IN TERMS OF WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE IN IS IN ON PAGE NINE OF HIS ANALYSIS. THIS IS WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPONENTS THERE AT LEAST TWO CAMPS ONE GROUP WAS COOLEY TRYING TO SIMPLY KILL THE PROJECT. THERE WON'T BE SATISFIED INTO THE PROJECTS TOTALLY ABANDONED. ANOTHER GROUP SIMPLY WANTS TO ENSURE THE PROJECT IS SIZED APPROPRIATELY WHATEVER THAT SIZE MIGHT BE. THE AUTHOR APPEARS TO BE FIRMLY IN THIS SECOND CAMP I AGREE WITH THAT DIAGNOSTIC. HE CLEARLY IS IN THAT SECOND CAMP I I BELIEVE HIM IN TERMS OF WHERE HE'S AT I BELIEVE THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT CAN'T. FIND THAT'S YOUR RIGHT IN DEMOCRACY TO BE IN THAT CAMP SO HE WANTS TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE. SO GOING TO WHAT CENTER BOARD JUST SAYS IS THERE A SOLUTION TO THIS THING WHAT I HAD SUGGESTED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH GERMAN IN THE OR THE PROPONENT OTHERS WAS TWO THINGS THAT. INFORM THE PROBLEM IF IN FACT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO REALLY TEST THE SCIENCE. IF IN FACT YOU HAVE A HAPPY LÃ  MCCOY PALESTINIANS AND THE JEWS. THANK WERE NEITHER SIDE TRUST EACH OTHER HOW DO YOU CREATE A PROCESS THAT PEOPLE TRUST. ONE YOU PUT A TIME LINE ON IT. YOU PUT A TIME LINE ON IT YOU SAY THAT OKAY WE'RE GONNA DO THIS DIAGNOSTIC BUT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO DELAY FOREVER BECAUSE NO ONE TRUSTS THE PARTIES LET'S PUT A TIME LINE. THAT SAYS THAT THIS SCIENCE REFUTES SCIENTIFIC REVIEW TO BE ABLE TO BE CERTAIN BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES OF OF A MISTAKE IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCE PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROPERTY WHICH IS SO UNIQUE. IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE THIS TRUCK CANTIK AQUIFER THAT WAS DISCOVERED GUT THIRTY SOME YEARS AGO FORTY WHATEVERIT WAS BACK WILL DISCOVERED IT. BUT THE POINT IS THAT. ALL YOU PUT A TIME ON IT. AND THE TEST SHOULD BE DONE TO DETERMINE BY WHAT WE SAY BUT WHAT THE SCIENTISTS AT HOW MUCH TIME TO THE THE SIX MONTHS THAT YEAR WHATEVER IT IS AND PUSH THEM TO BASICALLY GET TO THE TRUTH. WHATEVER IT IS IT IS FACTUAL SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES THE AUTHOR SAYS LET THE SCIENCE SPEAK. TO I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION BUT IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN REYES AND I SHOULD TYPE PROPOSED TO THE CHAIR IS ONE OF THE LAST QUESTION IS HIS WHO ARE THE WHO'S THE JUDGE AND JURY. ONE OF THE REASONS THERE'S THE CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT TO SANTA MARGARITA IS THEY HAVE A FARM ON THE SCALE THEY HAD AN INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME WHICH SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN THE CASE TONIGHT BUT I KNOW THAT CENTER OFFICE RIGHT WITH RESPECT TO THE STANDARD REVIEW. OF THE COURT CASE AND THE I AGREE WITH HIS ANALYSIS SO HOW DO YOU GET IN IN THE AN ENTITY IT WAS SUGGESTEDIN THE ANALYSIS SOME OPTIONS I'M AGNOSTIC ON WHAT THOSE ARE -- THERE'S AN OPINION WELL PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE AN OPINION THE PROJECT'S BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME FAIR ARGUMENT BUT AGAIN GET TO THE POINT WHERE. YOU DON'T RESPECT THE LEGITIMACY OF WHAT THE AUTHORS BRINGING. POINT TAKEN CHECK DONE. TO CREATE A A PROCESS THAT IS TOO QUICK SO THAT NO VINCE IS NOT ABOUT DELAY BUT IT'S ABOUT. GETTING TO THE ISSUES TO WHICH THE CAMP THAT. THE GENERAL OFFICE INVOLVED AND THREE ANOTHER ONLY ANSWER THIS ONE I ONLY RAISE IT. MAKE SURE THAT THE JUDGE AND JURY OF THAT DATA IS SOMEBODY WHO EVER BOTH SIDES HAV CONFIDENCE IN YOU GET TO THE END GAME THAT CENTER BOARDS I THINK IS THE ANSWER. TO ADDRESS THE LEGITIMACY OF BUT AVOID A AN ISSUE WITH THE BOTH SIDES ARE IN THE GAME AND CUT TO THE CHASE OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER IN TERMS A JUDGE AND JURY BUT I CERTAINLY THINK A TIME LINE. AS GENERAL TALKED ABOUT WOULD BE A REASONABLE SOLUTION. BUT OTHERWISE I THINK THAT HE'S CORRECT WITH RESPECT TO THE NEED TO DO THIS ON THE FRONT END. WELL MY UNDERSTANDING CENTER HERTZBERG IS THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME IDEAS ALREADY PROPOSED SENATE ROTH CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG EVEN LAST YEAR OR RECENTLY ABOUT. SOME JOINT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE DOING FRONT AND SCIENTIFIC REVIEW THAT. WE STILL DON'T HAVE A RESPONSE FROM THE OPPONENTS -- THE PROJECT PROPONENTS YET -- I I I KNOW THAT THERE'D BEEN SOME IDEA LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT. AGENCIES RIGHT NOW WE'RE TO FOCUS ON STATE LANDS COMMISSION IN THE PRESENT BILL. THERE'S THERE'S DISCUSSION ABOUT D. W. ARE YOU AT ONE POINT HAD NO IDEA ABOUT. PUTTING THEM ALL TOGETHER ALONG WITH DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WHO BY THE WAY IS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT STILL HAS. SOME PURVIEW HERE -- HAVE YOU HAD A RESPONSE YET. FROM. SO I WOULD ASK THE MISTER SLATER DO YOU HAVE A A RESPONSE TO THIS THIS CONCEPT OF DOING THE KIND OF FRONT AND REVIEW THE AS YOU SAID THE NOW ASSESSMENT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- WITH D. W. R. -- AS WELL AS WHAT I HAD HEARD WAS DEPARTMENT EFFICIENT WILDLIFE AND STATE LANDS COMMISSION SO CERTAIN SOME SORT OF JOINT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES THE NOW SAYS POINTS OUT. THERE'S A CONFLICT AS TO WHO IS A FAIR OBJECTIVE AN INDEPENDENT ARBITER -- EVERYONE SORT OF HAS A VENUE PREFERENCE I UNDERSTAND HERE BUT EVEN OPINION ON THAT SORT OF FRAMEWORK. PROPOSED I DO -- THE YOU YOU WOULD START WITH A SUBJECT MATTER GROUNDWATER BEING RIPOSTE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IT IS THE ENTITY WHICH IS ACTED AS A WATER MASTER GROUNDWATER CONTACTS IN CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES -- IT IS -- THE OVERSIGHT ENTITY FOR CIGNA IT UNDERSTANDS THE INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN GROUNDWATER AND IN SERVICE WATER -- AND AND SO I WOULD SAY IT WOULD BE THE NATURAL CONVENER FOR THE TITULAR HEAD OF WHATEVER INTO DE THERE WAS. MAN I THINK YOU COULD YOU COULD DO IT IN AS LONG AS IT'S OPEN AND TRANSPARENT AND I THINK FOCUSED ON THE SUBJECT MATTER THAT THE SENATOR HAS. AND AND THE PROJECT OPPONENTS HAVE GREATEST FOCUS ON IS. IS THE INTERCONNECTION IN THE SPRING IN THE HARM TO FISH AND WILDLIFE AT THAT SPRING -- YOU COULD EITHER HAVE DEAL YOU ARE HANDLED INDEPENDENTLY OR CONVENE A PROCESS AND IT IS NOT UNLIKE OTHER TECHNICAL REVIEW PROCESS SEES WHERE. ALL SCIENTISTS WITH CREDENTIALS CAN COME AND PARTICIPATE AND THE ARBITER OF THE THE FINDER AND AND THE RECEIVER OF THAT INFORMATION AND DECISION MAKER IS D. W. R. -- BUT IT'S NOT LIMITING IN WHO IT LISTENS TO IT LISTENS THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND WHOEVER'S PRODUCING IT AND HOLD IT UP TO CRITICAL THOUGHT. SO. WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THE JOINT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE I THINK THAT THE JOINT GOVERNANCE IS MORE CUMBERSOME THERE'S NOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AT EVALUATING GROUNDWATER ISSUES -- AND AND I THINK IF YOU ASSIGNED TO YOU HAVE YOU ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY THEY HAVE THE THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT. TO INTERVIEW ANYBODY THEY WANT TO TO GAIN THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND INFORMATION WHICH HELPS THEM COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT NEEDS TO BE. GAINED SO I THINK BY LAW BY POINTING TO HAVE YOU ARE YOU OPEN AND OPEN IT UP -- TATE TO A PROCESS AND INPUT. IT WOULD BE. COULD INCLUDE PROJECT OPPONENTS OCCUR IN IN IN IN IN INDEED IN FACT TO GET THE RESOLUTION WE HOPE FOR WE WANT THEM TO COME FORWARD WITH THEIR SCIENTIFIC POSITION SO AGAIN IT CAN BE HELD UP TO CRITICAL THOUGHT AND LIKEWISE. PAPERS AND AND SCIENTIFIC REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPILED BY THE SANTA MARGARITA THE COUNTY -- IN KIDDIES COULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED THESE ARE. A SAID EARLIER IN A CONVERSATION -- A MEASURING TAPE IS IS A MEASURING TAPE AND IT AND AND WE MEASURE DATA AND THAT IS RIGHT THAT SHOULD NOT BE TO SUB -- THE SUBJECT OF OPINION AND AND THOSE THINGS THAT ARE PRESENTED AND AND ANALYZED MEDIA BY D. W. R. SHOULD BE. OPEN TRANSPARENT AND THE AND THE DECISIONS BASED ON IT. AVAILABLE UNDERSTOOD -- AND I WANTED TO GET AN OPINION FROM FROM THE PROPONENTS OF BILLS WAS THE OPPONENTS ABOUT THE ANALYSIS IT DOES POINT OUT SOME OF THESE FURTHER PENDING REGULATORY. DECISIONS. IN BOTH FROM I BELIEVE STATE LANDS. DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S. I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M SORRY IN THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT AS TO WHETHER TO OPERATE UNDER. THE PRIOR WHEELING AGREEMENT OR OR OR SOME NEW FORMAL WHEELING BECAUSE OF ITS YET TO BE SUBMITTED SO. MAYBE I'LL STOP I'LL START WITH THE AUTHOR AND AND AND SPONSOR ON ON THAT. WELL SUBSEQUENT -- WELL MISTER CHAIR IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE AGENCIES THAT SHOULD THIS PROJECT -- MOVE START TO MOVE FURTHER HAVE ADDITIONAL ROLES TO PLAY. BERMAN OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AS A LAKE AND STREAM BED ALTERATION PROCESS TO DETERMINE AN AGREEMENT WHERE. THE PROJECT CROSSES DOES IT WASHES AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT REMEMBER AT THAT POINT IT'S I THINK THE TERM OF ART IS RESPONSIBLE AGENCY SO. DE BERMAN FISH AND WILDLIFE'S BOUND BY THE CAN BY THE WITH THE SCIENCE IN THE E. R. -- SO THERE'S NO AND AND IN ANY EVENT WHETHER IT IS OR IT ISN'T THERE'S NO INDEPENDENT REVIEW THE KIND OF FRONT END ASSESSMENT AND I'M TALKING ABOUT. THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION OF COURSE SAYS. AUTHORITY WHERE THE PROJECT CROSSES OF STATE OWNED LAND AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S A STRIP ABOUT A MILE LONG AND TWO HUNDRED FEET WIDE. THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE IMPACTED OR CROSSED BY THIS PROPOSED PROJECT AND IF IT IS THEN -- AS A LEASE WITH THE STATE IN THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION NEEDS TO BE NEGOTIATED AGAIN. NO INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT ANY SORT OF FRONT AND SCIENTIFIC REVIEW ASSESSMENT IN RECONCILIATION BY. THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND OF COURSE THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT IN THE WHEELING AGREEMENT THE PROPOSAL HERE. IS TO IS TO PUT THE PUB TAKE TRANSPORT THE WATER. FROM THE AQUIFER ABOUT FORTY SIX OR SO MILES IN PIPE UNDERGROUND TO THE CALIFORNIA AQUEDUCT AS I RECALL. AND M. W. D.'S AUTHORITY AT THAT POINT IS TO ASSESS. THE IMPACT ON THE ACT WITH A TO PROVE THE DESIGN OF THE FACILITY AND ALSO -- RESOLVE ANY CONCERNS THAT M. M. W. D. HAS WITH RESPECT TO CHEMICALS IN THE WATER THAT ARE PULLED OUT. OF THE AQUIFER THERE'S A AN ISSUE HAVING TO DO WITH CHROME -- SIX AND PERHAPS SOME OTHER ISSUES -- HAVING TO DO WITH THE WATER THAT WOULD NEED TO BE RESOLVED BY END OF THE DAY BUT AGAIN. IN W. YOU KNOW AND I'M NOT THE WATER EXPERT MISTER SLATER. HAS OF A FEW MORE YEARS AND I BUT IN W. D. HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES. NOT CONDUCT THE KIND OF INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC ASSESS WHEN AT THE FRONT IN THE RECONCILIATION OF U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY NATIONAL PARK SERVICE SCIENCE OTHER SCIENCE. WITH THE KIDDIES OF PROPOSAL -- ON THE FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET DOES THAT ADDRESS YOUR CONGESTION DOES. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- SO LET LET ME BEGIN WITH -- NOTHING THAT WE WOULD DO HERE WOULD BE INTENDED TO YOU SIR FOR TAKE AWAY THE JURISDICTION OF THE OTHER AGENCIES ARE YET TO PASS ON THE PROJECT. SO I START WITH WATER CODE SECTION THIS IS AN AMENDMENT INTO THE WHEELING STATURE. SO -- WATER CODE SECTION EIGHTEEN TEN D.. AT THE REQUEST OF INYO MONO COUNTY BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDED A PROVISION. PREVENTED TRANSFERS OCCURRING THROUGH WHEELING -- IF THAT WOULD HARM FISH AND WILDLIFE'S SO WHAT THIS IS IS THIS IS A SEPARATE ONE OFF. AND I CAN GIVE YOU PRESIDENT FOR THIS WHEN THEY WERE WHEN THE WILLING STATURE WAS INITIALLY PUT IN PLACE THERE WAS A TIME IN. NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THAT THE LEGISLATURE FOR EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXISTED -- OVER THE USE OF THE COLORADO RIVER ACT WITH OCT -- IMPOSER ADOPTED A BILL EIGHTEEN TWELVE POINT FIVE WHICH DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO CONDUCT IN AN INVESTIGATION TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION -- IT WAS URGENCY BILL IT LASTED -- FOR I BELIEVE EIGHTEEN MONTHS WHILE DAVID KENNEDY PROVIDED HIS INPUT I RAISE THAT BECAUSE THIS PROVISION NEED TO BE RECONCILED WITH EIGHTEEN TEN DAY MATT MATT IS GOING TO MAKE ITS DETERMINATIONS UNDER EIGHTEEN TEN D. LOOK AT ALL OF THE THE PROVISIONS THAT HOUSE TO LOOK AT THIS IS. A MORE FOCUSED ANALYSIS WHICH WOULD BE ADDITIVE AND IT WOULD BE FOCUSED ON A COUNTY AND A SPECIFIC PROJECT. SOIN IN THIS INSTANCE THEN WE WOULD WE WOULD RECONCILE THE POTENTIAL INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN EIGHTEEN TEN THE AND THIS PROVISION BY MAKING IT APPLICABLES ONLY. TO THIS AREA. AND IN AND THINK THIS IS A PERFECTLY SUITABLE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. THE OTHER MEMBERS OF A COMMONER QUESTION -- SENATE JACKSON THANK YOU HAD. I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF HISTORY TO THIS AND AND I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO IT I HAVE A LOCAL. A WONDERFUL COMPANY THAT. DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THIS BILL PASSED SO I'M PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO THIS ISSUE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AND I HAVE THE HIGHEST REGARD. FOR US SENATOR ROTH HE DOES HIS HOMEWORK LIKE NOBODY I KNOW. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS REALLY WHAT HE'S ASKING FORCES UP FRONT. EFFORT. AND AND SO I I WANT TO SIMPLIFY THIS CONSENT MY QUESTION WAS A GENUINE. ONE REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU ULTIMATELY DECIDE WHAT THAT UP FRONT APPROACH WOULD BE. ARE YOU WILLING TO CONSIDER. DOING THIS BEFORE YOU INVEST ALL THAT MONEY BEFORE A LOT OF PEOPLE CONTRACT WITH YOU FOR THAT WATER BEFORE BEFORE THE TABLE IS SET YOU KNOW SOMETIMES. IT'S IT'S EASIER TO ASK FORGIVENESS THAN PERMISSION AND MIKE MY QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO HAVE THIS AND ALEC ALL EVERYTHING ELSE. WHATEVER'S HAPPENED HAPPENED WE ARE HERE TODAY WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO THIS UP FRONT -- IMPACT IF VALUE OR FRONT END IMPACT EVALUATION THAT SPECIFICALLY DEALS WITH THIS PARTICULAR SPRING. AND SO THERE CAN BE SOME. SOME UNDERSTANDING RECOGNITION ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THE JUDGMENT IF INDEED THIS IS GOING TO HAVE THAT. SACRAMENTO IMPACT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IS BELIEVED TO BE THE CASE. THAT'S JUST HOW I WANT TO KNOW IS MATTER WOULD YOU DINNER SENATOR JACKSON ANSWERS YES UNEQUIVOCALLY YES. THANK YOU THAT HAS DEFINED AS YOU JUST DEFINED IT AS THE AS THE CHAIR TO FIND. LET THE RECORD SHOW UP WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA TRY TO TRUNCATE THIS THIS UP SO OF ONE LEARN COMMON AND THEY'LL MOVE FORWARD. I WANNA MAKE CERTAIN -- THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE I WANT TO THANK -- AND CENTER ROTH FOR ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING OF COURSE -- KIDDIES AND THE COMMENTS -- I'M FROM NOW FOR MORE FIRMLY THE OPINION THAT REASONABLE MINDS CAN CERTAINLY PREVAIL EVEN IN COMPLICATED SITUATIONS. JUST SO I'M. CLEAR A JOT DOWN A COUPLE OF NOTES ON WHAT. WOULD BE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS DECEIVES THE MAKER OF THE ITEM WOULD BE WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD. BASED ON WHAT CENTER JACKSON HAD SAID IN YOUR AGREEMENT -- RESPONSE. IS THAT THERE WOULD BE A THAT D. W. R.. WOULD YOU SERVE AS LEAD AGENCY TO CONVENE AN UP FRONT. OUR STUDY. OF THIS PROJECT. AND IT'S SUSTAINABILITY. THE D. W. R. WOULD SIT AS A TRUSTEE -- ON THE BOARD. MOVING FORWARD. AND THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ANNUAL OR AS NEEDED TO REVIEW TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE IS NO DEPLETION -- THAT IS UNFORESEEN. BUT THAT THAT STUDY BY D. W. R. IS LIMITED TO THE SPRINGS. IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER MR OFF ITS. SENATOR THE PROBLEM WITH NEGOTIATING AMENDMENTS FROM THE NOW IS IT'S TOUGH. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LANGUAGE REALLY LOOKS LIKE AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS LOCATIONS. I DISAGREE WITH WHAT MISTER SLATER SAID WITH THE DIP WITH RESPECT TO THE DISCHARGE AND RECHARGE RATES THE DISCHARGING RESEARCH JUST CHARGE AND RECHARGE RATES DIRECTLY IMPACT THE SPRINGS IF YOU'RE PULLING MORE WATER OUT OF THE AQUIFER. THEN YOU'RE PUTTING BACK IN DEPENDING ON HOW THE SCIENCE RESOLVES THIS. IF THE SPRINGS ARE CONNECTED BOTH BONANZA AND ANY OTHER THERE FOR FIVE OTHER SPRINGS ASSOCIATED OUT THERE IN THE WATER LEVEL IN THE SPRINGS IS DEPLETED WHICH IMPACTS BIGHORN SHEEP VEGETATION THIS SAID THE OTHER SO IT'S ALL INTERCONNECTED. AND IT IS A IT IS A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW AND RECONCILIATION OF THE SCIENCE. I'M PERFECTLY WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHO DOES IT I'M MORE PERSONALLY AGNOSTIC ON THE POINT. BUT I'VE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE UNTIL THIS MORNING. WE HAVE NOT HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT FRONT END REVIEW EVER. WITH KIDDIES SO I'M PERFECTLY WILLING IF THIS BILL SHOULD HAPPEN TO MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I HAVE NO IDEA. TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND TO WORK TO A A COMPROMISE SOLUTION THAT MISTER SLATER AND HIS COMPANY HAVE CONFIDENCE. IT ACCOMPLISHES MY SOLE OBJECTIVE HERE WHICH IS TO RESOLVE RECONCILE THE SCIENCE AND SENATE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RIGHT UP I PLEDGE THAT TO YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. SO THERE'S A MOTION I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO RESOLVE DECADES OF CONFLICT HERE FROM THE DIS TODAY BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT I THINK SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. SOME POSITIONS HAVE BEEN HAVE EVOLVED. I TRUST IN THE SENATOR IN THE AUTHOR FOR ALL HIS DILIGENCE. TO TO TO TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION -- WE DO HAVE A MOTION AT TO TO A MEN AT TWO MEN THEN MOVED TO APPROPRIATIONS BUT YOU KNOW THE THE RECORD ESTABLISHED IN THIS HEARING THEN THE WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT SOME OTHER KIND OF FRONT AND REVIEW -- PRIOR TO PROJECT INITIATION I THINK IS. NOT WORTHY AND WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION. SO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU. YOU IN THE PROPONENTS CONSIDER THAT GOING FORWARD. AND WORK WITH US IN THE-COMMITTEE -- SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY. AND IGN NOW JING THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING IN GOOD FAITH THIS WHOLE TIME AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN A HEADACHE. BUT ALL IMPORTANT ISSUES ARE. CENTERS FOR DO YOU WANT TO JUMP IN WITH ONE LAST A PIECE OF WISDOM YES SIR I JUST THINK MISTER MAYES WANNA MAKE SURE. I WAS SUPPORTED BUT I I I JUST CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH. THAT I THINK THAT THE TWO ISSUES I REYES NEED TO BE RESOLVED AT LEAST AS RELATES FROM MY OWN VOTING ON THIS THING GOING FORWARD IS. ONE FIGURING OUT A TIME LINES THAT IT'S FAIR PROCESS WHATEVER THAT IS I I DON'T KNOW THAT IS I'M NOT AN EXPERT. BUT I THINK IT'S A FAIR OBSERVATION IT SHOULD BE A TIME LINE FOR THIS THIS ANALYSIS TO BE DONE EXPERTS WILL HAVE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AND I ASK THAT YOU. WORK ON THAT AND SECONDLY YOU KNOW THE ISSUE OF WHO THE THAT THE JURY IS IF YOU WILL BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT A JUDGE AND JURY BECOME VERY IMPORTANT AGAIN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO ANSWER A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. IN A MANNER THAT'S FAIR AND PROVIDES CONFIDENCE TO TO OUR ROLE AS IN GOVERNMENT THAT WE WE'VE DONE THIS THING RIGHT. AND NOT JUST STUCK A FINGER IN SOMEBODY'S ON CENTER WE DO HAVE A MOTION. WITH THAT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. IS TO PASS AS A MINUTE TO APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR STERN STERN HI ACCIONES ALLEN. ALLEN AYE PORGES [inaudible] ZERO HERTZBERG BOB HERTZBERG BY HUESO. JACKSON AYE JACKSON AYE MONNING. MONEY. NINE THE BILL HAS FIVE ROOMS SO. THE BILL AS FIVE VOTES WE WILL LEAVE THE MEASURE ON CALL -- FOR THE VICE CHAIR -- BUT WE HAVE IT'S FIVE ZERO AS OF NOW. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR PATIENCE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT YOU OKAY SINCE I GUESS FILE ITEM SIX SENATOR NIELSEN. SB. TWO TWO SIX BUT IN CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THIS PAST SEE. THIS BILL IS DEALING WITH. THE DAMAGE THUS FAR WROUGHT. BUT I COULD CONTEMPLATE AN ONGOING NEED. BUT THIS COULD SET. A PATTERN. FOR THE SENATE BILL. TWO TWO SIX I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. IT CREATES A WATERSHED RESTORATION GRANT PROGRAM AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OF UP TO MILLION DOLLARS FOR UP TO FIVE TIME FIVE YEARS. THE COUNTIES THAT WERE. UNDER EMERGENCY PROCLAMATIONS FOR THE 202-017-22018. WILDFIRES. NOW THAT'S THE UNIVERSE WE'RE DEALING WITH THAT WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE MORE PROBLEMS. CAN GET CATASTROPHIC THINGS IN THE SITUATION IN THE FUTURE. THESE FIRES COME THROUGH AND ONE OF THEM THAT I DEALT WITH WAS. SKIPPING AHEAD SIX FOOTBALL FIELDS. THE MINUTE. IN FIFTY MILE AN HOUR WINDS WITH CANYONS ON EITHER SIDE. HAVING. DEALT WITH THESE FOR MOST WILDLIFE [inaudible] THE DESTRUCTION. CAN BE LONG LASTING. IN SOME CASES. THE TOPSOIL IS STERILIZED. TAKES MANY MANY DECADES. TO COME BACK [inaudible] WILDLIFE'S [inaudible] IS DESTROYED. COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AND PRIVATE PROPERTY. IN THE CASE OF SOME FIRES IT WITH EXPERIENCE. MY CASE EIGHTY FIVE HUMAN LIVES WERE LOST LAST YEAR. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS A WATERSHED RESTORATION GRANT PROGRAM? TO ALLOW SOME HELP LET'S SAVE ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS FOR A GRANT. FOR A FIVE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. THE COUNTIES TO DO WILDLIFE. MEANWHILE FIRE. RESTORATION NOW ADDED WILD LIFE TO THAT BECAUSE IF YOU RESTORE. THE FORCE IN THE WILD LANDS YOU'RE GOING TO RESTORE. THE WILDLIFE AS WELL. IT IS CRITICAL. THERE ARE SOME POINTS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT GENERAL FUND THAT. WILL BE EXAMINING OTHER SOURCES THIS BILL WILL GO TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AS WELL. AS WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME SICK WHAT. MOVEMENTS. CORD TEMPERING IF YOU WILL. AND WILL HAVE TO HAVE AN APPROPRIATIONS CONSIDERATION OF FOR THE MONEY. WOULD COME FROM. BUT THAT SAID. THE WHOLE JOB. GOAL HERE IS TO DO WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY. TO RESTORE THE SOILS THE VEGETATION [inaudible] WILDLIFE. ON THE FORCE IN A WHILE LANCE. CLAIM THIS VERY. VERY MUCH. DESTROYED. LAND IN CALIFORNIA. THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE TO THIS TO THAT AFFECTS. OUR WATER WICKS. WITH THE LAN DENUDED. THEN WE HAVE. GREAT PROBLEMS WITH EROSION SENATE SUBSTATION. AND ALSO THEN WE HAVE. TREES. TO COME DOWN. AND PREVENT THE WATER FLOW. AND CREATE AN EFFECT DANCE THE EMPTY. NOW WE'RE NOT GONNA DEAL WITH THE HALF FILLED. IN THE RIVERS IN THE BY WAYS RIGHT NOW. THIS BILL WILL LOW. CONTAIN THAT EROSION. THAT DOES HAPPEN. SO IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE -- I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK YOU'RE JUST VOTING ON A CONCEPT HERE BECAUSE WE'RE VERY RESOLVED IN WITH AS MANY COUNTIES AS ARE AFFECTED I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO GAIN THE SUPPORT THAT WE NEED FOR THE ONGOING AMOUNT OF MONEY. TO BE PUT IN THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR AND NO FRANKLY A FOR THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE THAT WE HAVE BROUGHT THIS IS. NOT EVEN GOING TO BE CLOSE TO SUFFICIENT. BUT WE COULD. MAKE SOME PROGRESS AND I WOULD ASK YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU BEGIN THAT PROCESS. THANK YOU A CENTER NIELSEN -- THERE IS APPARENTLY NO -- OPPOSITION ON THIS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO HAVE WITNESSED SAY A FEW WORDS. PLEASE FEEL FREE. A BRIEF CARE SINGLE BIGGIE WITH A CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL JUST A COUPLE OF STATISTICS WITH REGARDS TO THE IMPACT THESE WILDFIRES HAVE HAD ON OUR WATERSHEDS. IN ADDITION TO RELEASING TOXINS INTO A WATER SUPPLY THESE FIRES KILL HEALTHY TREE ROOTS WITHOUT THE ROOTS CONTAMINATING -- SETTLEMENT AND ASHER FLUSH BY RAIN INTO THE RESERVOIRS RIVERS LAKES AND SUPPLY CITIES WITH DRINKABLE WATER. IN ADDITION A STUDY PREDICTED THAT WILDFIRES COULD DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SENTIMENT IN A THIRD OF THE LARGEST WESTERN WATERSHEDS BY. TWENTY FIFTY A WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU'D PLEASE STEP FORWARD. GOOD MORNING ADAM CAN UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THERE IS NONE NOTED BUT IF THERE IS. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE BRING BACK TO THE DIET SENATOR HUESO.

DURING THAT TIME FRAME. GOOD MORNING SENATOR FURTADO THE FLOOR IS YOURS. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY I AM HERE TO INTRODUCE SB. FIVE FIVE NINE SB FIVE FIVE NINE AIMS TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO RESTORE WATER SUPPLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TODAY MORE THAN A HUNDRED RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAVE CONTAMINATED TAP WATER WHILE MANY OTHERS HAVE SEEN THE WELLS GO DRY. COMPLETED IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE IT RUNS A HUNDRED FIFTY TWO MILES FROM FRIGHT DOWN TO THE KERN RIVER IN BAKERSFIELD. IT IS A KEEP FACILITY FOR DELIVERING CLEAN RUNOFF FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER WATERSHED TO RECHARGE GROUNDWATER AQUIFER'S. SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST NOTABLE COMMUNITIES RELY ON THE SYSTEM TO DELIVER CLEAN WATER INCLUDING SEVEN CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT SERVE NEARLY A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND MUNICIPAL CONNECTIONS AS WELL AS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL FAMILY FARMS. TODAY PORTIONS OF THE CANAL HAS DECLINED BY TWELVE FEET BELOW ITS ORIGINAL DESIGN ONE THIRD OF THE CANAL HAS SUFFERED THE LOSS OF 60% OF ITS CARRYING CAPACITY. MANY COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY INCLUDING FARMERS FAMILIES BUSINESSES. AND CHILDREN DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST BASIC HUMAN RIGHT CLEAN WATER. SB FIVE FIVE NINE WILL INVEST IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE -- TO ACT THE CANAL WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE UP TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER PER YEAR IN DELIVERIES AND HAVE SEVERE IMPACTS OUR LOCAL ECONOMY AND BEYOND. AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FRANK KERN CANALS AND INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I HAVE WITH ME TODAY DOUG THE FOOTAGE. FROM A CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR THE FRONT WATER AUTHORITY. AND BRYCE MARKETEER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE EASTERN TROLL GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH AND THEN THEY'LL BE AN OPPORTUNITY I'M SURE OF QUESTIONS. THANK YOU COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING MY NAME STUDY FLETCHER I AM THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR THE FRONT WATER AUTHORITY I OVERSEE THE FRANK KERN CANALS OPERATION MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR. WHICH INCLUDES -- OUR ON GOING WORK. TO KEEP THE CONVEYANCE CAPACITY OF THE FRANKLIN CAN NOW. ALTHOUGH IT'S A GOVERNMENT OF OLDER THE ALTHOUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES HOLD THE TITLE TO THE CANAL -- IT'S IN THE CENTER IT'S ESSENTIALLY A LOCAL WILL REGIONAL FACILITY FRANK CONTRACTORS -- WHO USE THE CANAL INCLUDE THREE LARGE CITIES IN THE VALLEY AND DOZENS OF WATER IN IRRIGATION DISTRICTS? ALL OF WHOM OF PAY THE OWN M. AND IF PAID OFF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE CANAL ITSELF SO THE ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HANDED OVER THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT CAN OUT TO THE FRONT WATER AUTHORITY IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX FRANK KERN CANALS A STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IT IT'S IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN MOST OF THE OTHER FACILITIES BECAUSE IT WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO SUPPORT SUPPORT GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY ON THE SIDE. AND IT'S DONE THAT VERY SUCCESSFULLY. THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THAT MARKS THE SEVENTIETH ANNIVERSARY THE FRANK KERN CAN NOW SO WE HAVE A PRETTY LARGE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE GOING ON WHERE THE CANAL IS LOST SOME OF ITS CONVEYANCE CAPACITY DUE TO SUBSIDENCE. WHEN THE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DROUGHT THERE IS A SEVERE CONSTRUCTION ON THE LOWER TWO THIRDS OF THE FRANK KERN CANAL NEAR THE TOWN OF PORTER BILL DID OVER PUMPING OF THE GROUNDWATER -- THAT HIS THAT IS BECAUSE THIS PAGE POINT TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE CANALS CONVEYANCE CAPACITY. TO JUST ABOVE 40% OF ITS DESIGN MAX. THIS REDUCTION MEANS THAT IN WHAT YEARS LIKE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE YEAR THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING THIS YEAR AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER. AS NOT ABLE TO BE SUPPLIED -- DOWN THE CANAL AND PUT IN THE GROUND. IN TERMS OF A DOLLAR VALUE THAT WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS AVERAGE ANNUAL. AND THE VALUE OF THE CANAL HOWEVER IS IS MUCH GREATER THAN THAT BECAUSE WITHOUT PUTTING WATER IN A YEAR THAT'S A LARGE YEAR WE DON'T HAVE WATER IN DROUGHT YEARS. SO THERE'S NO CARRY OVER TO BE ABLE TO TO GO INTO FOR DRYER YEARS. WHEN WE DISCOVERED THIS PROBLEM IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FRONT WATER AUTHORITY IMMEDIATELY GOT ON IT? GOT MOVING AND AND SCOPE THE PROBLEM THERE. TOO NARROWED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW ONE IS -- A RAISING OF THE BANKS ON THE ON THE FRANK KERN CANAL AND THE OTHER IS -- A PARALLEL REALIGNMENT OF THE FRANK KERN CANAL. BOTH OF THOSE WE EXPECTED A PLANNING DESIGNING NET AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING WE DONE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. AND FOR THE CURRENT COST OF FIXING THE CAN NOW WE EXPECT TO BE IN THE CAR ON THE ORDER OF THREE HUNDRED AND NINE MILLION DOLLARS THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS NUMBER THE PUBLIC THANK YOU ALL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE YOU OF MY TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT FOR SB. FIVE FIVE NINE BUT WE'VE INTRODUCTION MY NAME IS BRYCE MAC TIER UNDERGRADUATE OF DUKE UNIVERSITY AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE EASTERN TO LEE GSA. FIVE YEARS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF SIGMA I'M PROUD TO BE ON THE GROUND IMPLEMENTING CENTER PATHWAYS VISION FOR STABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. HE'S INTO LEE IS A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY THAT WAS FORMED. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BY SIX LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS THE CITY OF PORTABILITY AND COUNTY OF TULARE IN ORDER O PROVIDE FOR THE STABLE MANAGEMENT GROUNDWATER RESOURCES WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION. HE'S GOING TO LEASE RESPONSIBILITY IS VAST WE COVER JURISDICTION OVER A HUNDRED SIX ONE THOUSAND ACRES IN SIZE. WITH OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS ALL OF WHOM. LIVE IN EITHER DISADVANTAGED OR SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. FOR OVER FOR THE HOME TO APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF PRODUCTIVE YEAR GET LAND THAT SERVES IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF INCOME AND JOBS IN OUR AREA OF THE WORLD. SAFE SECURE RELIABLE AND QUALITY SUPPLIES OF SURFACE WATER VITAL TO OUR COMMUNITY DAY AND VITAL TO OUR COMMUNITY TOMORROW AS WE SEEK TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. OVERLYING THE TO SUBBASIN MY AGENCIES IN THE MIDST OF PREPARING IT'S GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL AGENCY PARTNERS. THAT WILL ADDRESS SEVERE OVERDRAFT SUBSIDENCE AND GROUND WATER QUALITY ISSUES PRESENT IN THESE FROM JULIE GSA'S BOUNCE. FORTUNATELY THE FRANKLIN CANAL RUNS THROUGH AGENCY PROVIDES PRISTINE SURFACE WATER SUPPLIES THE MEETS DRINKING WATER NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY SUCH AS TERRA BELLA. YOUR NATION NEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES IN PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROUND RECHARGED. IN YEARS LIKE THIS WE CAN ELEVATOR GROUND WATER LEVELS AND CONJUNCTIVE LEADERSLEGALIZE PLIES WITH AN EYE TOWARD THE FUTURE. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S ALSO IN THESE CAN TO ADDRESS A WITH FRANKLIN CANALS BUCKLING DUE TO SUBSIDENCE THREATENING THE LONG TERM ECONOMIC VIABILITY. AND THE DRINKING WATER LIABILITY OF COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AS OUR SUPPLIES REDUCE BY UPWARDS OF 60%. WHILE OUR LOCAL COMMITMENT WITHIN THE TRULY SUBBASIN IT'S BECOME GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABLE AND ARREST FUTURE SUBSIDENCE WE ALSO BELIEVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD PROVIDE US WITH A COMMITMENT TO HELP KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SUSTAINABLE. BY ENSURING THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND HISTORICALLY AVAILABLE SURFACE WATER SUPPLIES WITHOUT SUCH A COMMITMENT WE FORESEE DEVASTATING ECONOMIC IMPACTS BEING VISIT UPON ARE ALREADY DISADVANTAGED IN IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES. AS MANY LOSE THEIR SOURCES OF INCOME AS A RESULT OF LAND FOULING. THE FUNDING GAP THAT ALREADY EXIST FOR SOCIAL SERVICES AS A RESULT OF LOCAL. ARE SHRINKING LOCAL TAX REVENUES GETS EVEN WIDER. AND THE ALREADY PRESENT AFFECTS OF LOS WATER SUPPLIES AND THE OPPORTUNITY. FURTHER DIMINISHES OUR COMMUNITIES POTENTIAL FOR FIBER FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND GAVE EACH TWO AND A HALF MINUTES OF YOUR OPPOSITION WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE OF THAT EXTRA TIME AS WELL. BUT OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT STEP FOUR DAME AFFILIATION PLEASE ONLY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LEARNED ON HATE JACOB HOW HALF OF SOUTH VALLEY WATER. AUTHORITY AND CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MERION WARMER DAM ON BEHALF OF RURAL COUNTIES ALSO IN SUPPORT. GAIL DON'T HAVE WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. SO I GET US HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTIES OF FRESNO TULARE AND KERN IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. M. CHOPPER CITY SINGER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SHANE STRAWN CITY OF HANFORD HERE FOR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I'M KIANA SOME HAVE AQUA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. DANNY MARKLEY CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND CHAIR BY MAY CITY PORTABLE MICHAEL REPUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR HERE IN SUPPORT. MY APOLOGY SHOULD APPOINTED TO FIRST SENIOR HERE FOR ANY TECHNICALS TECHNICAL AND COMMITMENTS THAT THE CITY PORTABLE HAS IN THE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS FOR OUR OUR SMALL DRINKING WATER COMMUNITIES AROUND PORTABLE THANK YOU. ART BREANNA HANFORD CITY COUNCIL SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THE WITNESSES HERE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WOULD SOMEBODY RELINQUISHES SEE TO THIS GENTLEMAN MAY BE ABLE GOOD MORNING MORNING US GOOD AFTER. GOOD MORNING A BRAND ALSO WAS SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. VEHICLE CALIFORNIA OF RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES SB FIVE FIVE NINE AS WRITTEN WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WOULD UNDERCUT THE PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARY PAYS AND WILL OPEN UP THE STATE GENERAL FUND. FOR REPAIRS WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS THAT ARE FEDERALLY OWNED AND LOCALLY MAINTAINED. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE BENEFICIARY PAYS PRINCIPLE IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT THAT THOSE BENEFITING FROM THE PROJECT SHOULD FUND THE PROJECTS. THE FRANKLIN CAN NOW USE ALMOST ENTIRELY BY TWENTY AGRICULTURE WATER AGENCIES WHICH COLLECTIVELY IRRIGATE MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN NINE THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND. WHAT WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE REBUILDING OF THE CANAL OR THE REAR A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE COW IT IS OUR POSITION THAT THE SUBJECTS IN THE FRONT WATER AUTHORITY? SURE THE COST OF REPAIRING THE CANAL NOT THE STATE TAXPAYERS. MORE OVER THE QUESTION OF STATE VERSUS FEDERAL JURISDICTION OVER THE CANAL YOU'LL TO THE SAME CONCLUSION. THE FRANKLIN CANALS FAIRLY ON PROJECT MAIN MANAGED BY THE U. S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION. FOR WATER THIRTY HAS A CONTRACT WITH RECLAMATION TO MAINTAIN THIS NOW INCLUDING HEAVY MAINTENANCE IN THE OF THE KIND YOU DID AND PRESENTED TO YOU TODAY. CURRENTLY CURRENT PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES FOR THE FOR RESTORATION OF THE CANAL ARE ROUGHLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WITH THIS FRIEND DIVISION OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT AMOUNTING TO MORE THAN MILLION ACRES WHICH WOULD EQUATE TO MORE THAN UP AROUND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER ACRE. THIS IS NOT A HEAVY BURDEN AND WOULD ACTUALLY BE A LIGHT BURDEN FOR THE REGION GROWING HIGH VALUE ORCHARDS AND OTHER CROPS. DURING THE DEBATE REGARDING PROPOSITION THREE WEEKS HERE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA -- ARGUED THAT HOWEVER VIRTUES THE RECONSTRUCTION OF A FEDERAL CANAL IN A FEDERAL CVP DIVISION SERVING FEDERAL WATER SERVICE CONTRACTORS MIGHT BE. THE RECONSTRUCTION WAS NOT THE OBLIGATION OF STATE TAXPAYERS WE RESURRECTED ARGUMENT TODAY. THIS IS A FEDERALLY OWNED FACILITY OF WHICH THE STATE HAS HAD NO ROLE IN ITS DESIGN CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT OR OPERATION. NOR DOES THE STATE BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY OF THE DAMAGE OF THE FACILITY. IT IS MORE THAN REASONABLE IT IS MORE THAN REASONABLE TO REQUEST THAT BUREAU RECOGNITION OF FINAL WORK TOGETHER TO RESTORE THE FRANK CARRINGTON NOW. IN ANY DELAY OR AVOIDANCE UNDERTAKEN THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE COW UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE THE STATE TAXPAYER PICKS UP THE TAB CLEARLY ILLUSTRATE THAT MILLIE ILLUSTRATES THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE TENDED TO WITH URGENCY. WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BEING WILLING TO HEAR OUR CONCERNS AND SPEAK WITH US ABOUT THOSE CONCERNS WE UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE IN HER POSITION BRING FORTH THIS LEGISLATION. UNFORTUNATELY WE DISAGREE ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE LEGISLATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR AND OTHER ANOTHER SHOES BUT TODAY WE MUST URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU Q. OF ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR MONNING AND THEN CENTER BORCHERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN. THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD ON BEHALF OF HER DISTRICT I WOULD INVITE EITHER THE AUTHOR OR YOUR WITNESSES IF YOU COULD JUST RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THIS YEAR CLUB. WHY A FEDERAL PROJECT ARE WE SEEKING STATE GENERAL FUND MONEY? SO I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION IT REALLY IS THE THE FEDERAL PROJECTS BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THE FRANK KERN CANAL. INCLUDES GROUNDWATER RECHARGE IN GROUND WATER IS PART OF THE STAND WILL GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. AND THAT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE GOES TO A WHOLE HOST OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN OTHER VILLAGE. THIS IS WHY THE EASTERN TRULY GSA IS WITH US TODAY THAT TO HELP BOLSTER BOTH THE SURFACE WATER IN THE GROUND WATER ASPECT. THANK YOU AND THEN. WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION YOU REFERENCE SOME OF THE WHOLE STRING OF EXISTING CAN NOW ON I THINK YOU SUGGESTED SOME PARALLEL NEW CAN NOW. PART OF THE NEED FOR REPAIR IS SUBSIDENCE. HOW DO YOU? HOW DO YOU PREVENT FURTHER SUBSIDENCE FROM ACQUIRING FUTURE. INVESTMENT IN REPAIR. THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT THE TULE SUBBASIN GSA'S TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY I REPRESENT ONE OF SEVEN GSA THAT OVERLIES THE TO LISA BASIN. AND AS A PART OF PREPARING AND IMPLEMENTING RGS PLEASE OUR GOAL AND OUR STATE MANDATED COMMITMENT IS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARREST FEATURES BESIDES LONG FRANK OR CANAL WE ACTUALLY OF INITIATED AN ONGOING STUDY RIGHT NOW THAT'S INVESTIGATING. THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF THAT SUBSIDES AND HELPING A SCOPE AND SIZE THE PARTICULAR AND TYPES OF MANAGEMENT ACTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO REST FEATURES BESIDES. SO. I'M NOT AN EXPERT BUT IN MY CORRECT IN ASSUMING THAT SOME OF THE PROMISE OF SCIENCE A COMBINATION OF DROUGHT OVER DRAFTING OF OF GROUNDWATER YES AND IT GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S A RESULT OF GROUND WATER OVERDRAFTS. WE'RE INVESTIGATING WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS A RESULT OF TO LISA BASIN WIDE OVER DRAFTER WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE LOCAL FACTORS ACHE A PUMPING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE FRONT CURRENT NOW. AND ONCE WE HAVE. NEXT THAT STUDY WE'RE HOPING THAN TO SIZE THE APPROPRIATE TYPES OF MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND PROJECTS TO ADDRESS THAT CAN WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LOCAL AGENCIES IN FRONT WATER AUTHORITY. TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE FUTURE SCIENCE THANK YOU AND THEN. I'M HAS THERE BEEN ANY EFFORT TO SECURE FEDERAL FUNDING TO BE AT LEAST PART OF A SOLUTION HERE WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF DISCUSSION AT A WASHINGTON OF INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY ACTION. TOWARDS -- DIRECTING. CONGRESS -- WITH THE WHITE HOUSE. TO MOVE FORWARD ON INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT ARE THERE ANY EXISTING ALLOCATIONS THAT COULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES SO AS PART OF THE WORLD NGUYEN ACT WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE NATION ACT WE'VE -- SECURED BOTH FUNDING IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THESE WERE ALL FOR PRE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES TO THE ORDER OF ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. OUR OUR STAKEHOLDERS ARE CONSTITUENCIES OF PUT UP THE MATCH FOR THAT RIGHT NOW SO WITH ABOUT SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDS IN ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM OUR CONSTITUENCIES THAT'S HOW THE INITIAL PLANNING WORK IS GETTING DONE THANK YOU THAT CELL PHONE NO SIR ANY. PROSPECT OF ANY. FURTHER FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE CERTAINLY ARE LOOKING AT APPROPRIATIONS AND IN IN THE COMING YEARS YES WITH REQUEST IN. THANK YOU THANK YOU. BOTH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU OF CENTER BOARD JUST THAN SENATOR HUESO. THE TEACHER WOMAN I WANTED THINK -- SENATOR -- HER TAUGHT -- FOR BRING IN THIS -- THIS ITEM FORD I AM PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR WITH YOU ON THIS. AND I THINK THE MERITS OF THIS PROJECT -- FOR ANYONE WHO HAS SPENT ANY TIME. IN THE VALLEY -- OR IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS WOULD APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND. THE DESPERATE NEED WE HAVE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE -- THIS FRYING CURRENT CANAL FUNDING IS GOING TO TRANSFORM. COMMUNITIES WE'VE TALKED ARM AT GREAT LENGTH ABOUT THE NEED FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'VE TALKED AT LENGTH ABOUT SURFACE WATER RELIABILITY. AND OUR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR DECADES. AND THIS IS A PROJECT THAT BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER. IT DOES SO ON THE MERITS. AND I AM CERTAINLY PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS -- AND I I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO TO DO THE SAME. IF THERE IS FEDERAL FUNDING AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT -- OF SOME OF THE WISER VOICES IN WASHINGTON IT WOULD AGREE -- THAT THIS MERITS -- FEDERAL ALLOCATION AS WELL -- THAT WOULD HELP WITH THE THE COSTS. AND IF THE COSTS GO DOWN -- DEPENDING ON THE OVERALL -- PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT. OF A OF INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES THEN I IMAGINE THE BUDGET WILL REFLECT THAT ACCORDINGLY -- BUT I THINK THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE I'M JUST PROUD TO BE A PART. OF HELPING THE VALLEY HELPING -- UNDERPERFORMING IN DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES I HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER THIS IS A TRANSFORM AN EVENT AND ONCE AGAIN I I APPRECIATE -- ALL THE CONSIDERATION MY COLLEAGUES WOULD GIVE TO A CASTING AN AYE VOTE. REPORTER SAID ASSEMBLY CENTER HUESO WAS UP NEXT. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANNA -- ALSO -- THANK SENATOR OTELLO FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM. A RUNS ALONG KIND OF THE BACKBONE OF OUR STATE THAT MAKES OF THE CONVEYANCE OF WATER MUCH MORE COMPLICATED. AND MUCH MORE COSTLY THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM -- I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH A SIMILAR MATTER WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY. SALTON SEA AND THEY'VE THROWN IN A FEW. TWO THREE MILLION -- IT'S LIKE. THROWING A PENNY INTO THE WELL IN WISHING FOR MONEY. AND THE THE STATE HAS TAKEN THE THE THE BIGGEST ROLE IN TRYING TO FUND THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND REALLY WE HAVE ALSO. PUT UP A FEW HUNDRED MILLION. TO A MASSIVE MULTIBILLION DOLLAR PROJECT THIS IS A MUCH SMALLER ONE IMPORTANT. BUT AGAIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HERE COMPLETELY. WALKING AWAY FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES WITH OUR FORESTS WITH OUR WATER WAYS EVERYTHING ELSE BUT A WALL. THEY WANT TO BUILD A WALL AND THEY WANT TO BUILD A FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR WALL THAT WILL ACTUALLY TO ABSOLUTELY. NOTHING ZERO THAT'S JUST SEEMS TO BE THE PRIORITY WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE IS FALLING APART SALTON SEA NEW RIVER TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY. FRANK CANAL. THEY WANT TO BUILD A WALL. THERE WAS A HE APPOINTED -- A WATER CZAR. TRUMP DID TO LOOK OVER ALL THE WATER WAYS IN THE COUNTRY AND THERE ARE SIMILAR PROBLEMS LIKE THIS RECROSS COUNTRY. DEALING WITH THE MISSISSIPPI IN THE HALL AT A HIGHER RIVER AND IT'S IT DEALS WITH THE ABILITY TO MOVE GOODS FROM IMPORTANT PARTS OUR STATE INTERNATIONALLY AND THIS PRESIDENT BASICALLY MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE WILL. NOT BE ADDRESSING THE STATION THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. SO THAT'S WHAT'S WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. BUT THEY WILL BE WILL BUILDING A WALL. N. AND MY MESSAGE IS NOT ONLY TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BUT THE CALIFORNIANS AND THEN CALIFORNIANS OF OF TRUMP'S PARTY. THAT CONTINUE TO URGE. THE PRESIDENT TO BUILD A WALL AND SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT TO BUILD BUILD A WALL THAT WILL DO NOTHING TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF THEIR COMMUNITY. BUT IT WILL HURT. PROJECTS LIKE THIS THAT WOULD THEY REFUSE TO FUND THAT NEED TO FUND THAT ARE 100% IN THEIR JURISDICTION. JUST BECAUSE IT'S A 100% THEIR JURISDICTION I DON'T THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD WALK AWAY AND SAY WE'RE NOT GOING BEFORE THE SOLUTIONS WHEN WHEN A SPORT WILL TODAY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME LET'S BE CONSISTENT AND LET'S GET OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT. LET'S STAND FOR WHAT'S MOST. URGENT AND IF YOU'RE A FISCAL CONSERVATIVE SO SUPPORT. GOOD FISCAL SOLUTIONS THIS IS. ONE THAT DESERVES ATTENTION OF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND AND BUILDING A BORDER WALLS WHEN THAT DOESN'T. IT'S JUST NOT GOOD FISCAL PRUDENT [inaudible] GOVERNMENT. AND AND I HATE TO KIND OF COMBINE THEM BUT HERE THIS YEAR THERE'S BEEN A CONSISTENT SUBJECT AND THEN THIS HEARING. AND WE NEED REPRESENTATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO ADDRESS OUR NEEDS AND SOMETIMES OUR NEEDS ARE JUST PROVIDING. CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO OUR POPULATION. SOMETIMES OUR NEEDS ARE KEEPING OUR BOARD FOR IS FROM BURNING. SOMETIMES OUR NEEDS OF PROPRIETY WATER FOR AGRICULTURAL USE I MEAN THESE ARE ESSENTIAL THINGS. AND THEN LET'S LET'S BE CONSISTENT LET'S NOT STAND FOR SOMETHING HERE AND LET'S FIGHT FOR IT CONSISTENTLY. THANK YOU THERE IS SOME OF THE SENATE JACKSON BACK TO CENTER COPIER. YES SIDE I TO APPRECIATE IT WITH HOW HARD YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THOUGH I'M WONDERING HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER PROJECTS SIMILAR TO THIS WHERE WE'VE GONE INTO THE GENERAL FUND. BECAUSE WHAT YOU WHAT WE USUALLY DO IS WE BOND WHAT THE PUBLIC VOTE. THIS IS AN ASK OF THE GENERAL FUND WHICH ARGUABLY IT WOULD BE TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM OTHER AREAS. AND I JUST WONDER A HAVE THERE BEEN INCIDENCES BUT WE CAN ALWAYS THIS -- THE SORT OF THE PROVERBIAL CAMEL'S NOSE UNDER THE TENT TYPE OF THING IS THIS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND WHERE WE WOULD BE. ASKING FOR A RATHER SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT -- TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT REALLY IS A FEDERAL ISSUE -- AND AND TO ARE WE ARE WE LOOKING AT NOW WILL OPENING THAT DOOR FOR OTHERS TO COME IN BECAUSE OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR WHATEVER REASONS I WON'T I WON'T ACCUSE HIM OF BEING RIDICULOUS BUT WHATEVER REASONS MONEY IS BEING. RE DIRECTED -- WE FIND OURSELVES HAVING TO DO THE JOB THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING. CAN SOMEBODY ANSWER THAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF THIS HAVING HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY. THE NUMBERS TO SITE. NO THE FOUR HUNDRED MILK FOR EXAMPLE THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION YOU'RE ASKING THIS COME FROM THE GENERAL FUND IS THAT. IS THIS A IS THIS UNIQUE A UNIQUE ASK OR DO WE DO THIS ON OCCASION -- FOR VARIOUS REASONS. IF I MAY. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR THIS TYPE OF ACTION AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE USED. TO A CAMPAIGN AGAINST PROP THREE OF THAT THAT WAS A OBVIOUSLY SEVEN AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. ALLOCATION FRANK KERN THAT WE THOUGHT WAS -- FOR PRESIDENTIAL -- AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE A PRESIDENT AS WELL. SO A DEAL THANK YOU ANOTHER RESPOND AS WELL CERTAINLY. I'M JUST LOOKING FOR NOW YEAH NO WORRIES I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER ISN'T IT IS COMES FROM THE GENERAL FUND OR IF IT COMES FROM THE DROUGHT FUNDING BUT AS PART OF THE FRANK CURRENT CANAL PUMP BACK PROGRAM. WE HAVE A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES CURRENTLY. FOR THE FRANK KERN CANAL PUMP BACK PROJECT ON THE FRONT KERN CANAL SO WE ARE EXISTING. THERE IS EXISTING FUNDS BEING -- I PUT THOUGHT THAT WORD BACK AND FORTH BUT THAT WASN'T A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS YES MA'AM SO REST MUCH SMALLER SO -- SO THE SO THE REALLY ISN'T A PRECEDENT FOR THIS -- HAS THERE BEEN ANY DISCUSSION. ABOUT THE THE USERS WHO USUALLY ARE. YOU KNOW THE THE RIVER THE REPAIR. REPAIRS BEING DONE BY THOSE WHO USE THE THE WATER SHOULD THE CANALS AND SO FORTH I MEAN OR ARE WE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE BIGGER FARMERS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE INDUSTRIAL FARMERS LIKE ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND WITH WHO MAKE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY. HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THEY% BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ASK FOR SOME OF THIS MONEY OR IS THIS BASICALLY JUST AN ASK OF THE GENERAL FUND. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE ONLY WAY THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IS IF WE GET STATE FUNDING LOCAL FUNDING AND FEDERAL FUNDING. THAT WAS MY QUESTION MY QUESTION IS HOW ABOUT THE USERS HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM. THIS RESOURCE -- ARE THEY ARE THEY PARTICIPATING ARE THE BIG AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES WITCHER BENEFITING SOUL FINANCIALLY ARE THEY BEING ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS EFFORT AS WELL YES MA'AM AND AND AND THE AXE RIGHT NOW IS BEEN JUST FOR THE PRE CONSTRUCTION FUNDING TO WHICH THEY PUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BOARD -- I THINK THAT. IS THE END OF MY TERM. QUESTION YOU ARE A LAST QUESTION -- WHAT? IF IF WE HAD A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE WAS -- RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS -- TO REPAIR AND MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE ITS INFRASTRUCTURE THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IT HAS. RESPONSIBILITY. IS THEIR MONEY WOULD THERE BE MONEY AVAILABLE FROM ANY EXISTING FEDERAL FUNDS. TO TO COMPENSATE OR TO PAY FOR THIS FOR THIS PROJECT. RATHER THAN BE DEFAULTING TO THE STATE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS FUNDS NEED TO BE APPROPRIATED THROUGH CONGRESS BUT THEY BUT THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST ANOTHER -- EFFORTS SO I ASSUME MAYBE NOT IN THIS SIZE AND AND AND NATURE AGAIN SIMILAR SIMILAR TO YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER -- THE SIZE OF THIS PROJECT IS VERY LARGE. OKAY. WELL I APPRECIATED. I'M HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THE PRECEDENT IT SETS BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A DESPERATE NEED AND I I WOULD IT WAS THROUGH THE CHAIR. OF THE INVITE YOUR COMMENT THAT'S ALL I I HEALTH IS OF A CASE AND I WANT TO REITERATE I THINK -- WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRONT WATER THIRTY STATE EARLIER THIS HAS BEEN LOCALLY FUNDED LOCALLY OPERATED LOCALLY MAINTAINED? BY FRONT WATER AUTHORITY USERS BY THE LEADERS AND BY THE FARMERS IN THOSE AREAS SINCE ABOUT -- NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGACY ISSUE SUBSIDENCE AS A RESULT OF STATE AN ACTION THAT THE ISSUE OF SUBSIDENCE AS A RESULT OF A PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THERE WAS NO SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. AND SO THAT THE LACK OF PUBLIC POLICY THAT PUBLIC POLICY FAILURE HAS EFFECTIVELY UNDERMINED THE ABILITY. OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LOCALLY FINANCED AND PAID FOR THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE THE REGULAR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF THIS AREA -- TO TO SEE A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT AND SO IT'S AT LEAST THE THE OPINION THE EASTERN TO THE GSA THAT THE STATE SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN AND COLLABORATE WITH US AS WE WORK. TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT THE STATE IS ALREADY COMMITTED TO DOING SO WITH PROPOSITION ONE FUNDS IN PROPOSITION SIXTY FUNDS. TO WORK TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS IN MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO ARREST FUTURE SUBSIDENCE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGACY ISSUE. THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH TODAY. AS A RESULT OF THE LACK OF AFFECTED PUBLIC POLICY THAT'S LED TO THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR CAREER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK -- IT'S REALLY DESPERATELY NEEDED AND THE BACKGROUND ON WHAT THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN TO DETERMINE WHAT THE SUBSIDE WHAT. WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS TO THE FIXING THE SUBSTANCE SUBSIDENCE ISSUE -- I THINK THIS IS A PRACTICAL SOLUTION ORIENTED BILL AND I I AM THE QUESTION I HAVE IS -- BUT I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE BUT HOW LONG. THERE'S A WHOLE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THAT YOU HAVE TO UNDER UNDER GO HOW LONG UNTIL YOU HAVE PLANNING DOCUMENTS IT'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. YEAH SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PLANNING DOCUMENTS FOR THE BETTER PART OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS NOW WE THINK IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT ANOTHER EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO WERE FINALIZED WITH THE ENGINEERING DESIGN AN ENVIRONMENTAL WORK NECESSARY. TO DO A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT WE EXPECT TO WE EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO DO BAD AND GO INTO CONSTRUCTION. IN THE FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY AND SO YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FINISH COMPLETE THAT. YES MA'AM YES MA'AM THOSE ARE THE RESOURCES THAT THE LOCAL AGENCY OUR WATER USERS OF FOOT UP AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATE CAREER ANY OTHER MEMBERS -- THERE'S A MOTION. COMPETE COMPETING MOTIONS ACTUALLY I HEARD CENTER BOARD JUSTANSWER COVER YOUR BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT THE GUY. THE SOCIETY THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS A MAJOR ISSUE. OF ALL KINDS OF CONVEYANCE CHALLENGES WE NEED TO INVEST OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE I SOME SERIOUS CHALLENGES WITH THE MEASURE IN TERMS OF PARITY. TIMING RESPONSIBILITY -- LOT OF OTHER BILL ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OUTSTANDING NEED AROUND SUBSIDENCE WRIT LARGE MATTER CAN CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS. TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS THAT IN A WAY THAT. I'M PRIORITIZE THE MOST IMPORTANT PROJECT BUT ALSO THOSE THAT ARE REALLY WITHIN OUR PURVIEW. DOESN'T RIGHT. DOESN'T SIT RIGHT WITH ME I GUESS TO SUBSIDIZE FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY -- WHILE THEY SIT ON THEIR HANDS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OCCURRING IN THE FARM BILL DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY IDEAS OR ANYTHING. MOVING RIGHT NOW IN CONGRESS THAT MIGHT HAVE. MANY KNOWLEDGE MINUTES. RESPONSIBILITY THERE ANYTHING YOU'RE AWARE OF NO THEY HAVE SOME LOW INTEREST LOANS THAT MAY APPLY. RIGHT AS AS THE AS THE LOCAL SHARE NEEDS TO TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FUND IS PORTION RIGHT AND SOME LOCAL LOANS. SO YOU KNOW I I I SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOU GOING TO FIND FOR YOU DISTRICT CENTER TO AUTO AND I HAVE FAMILY OUT THERE TOO SO. SUCH AS EVEN SAID LIKE TEAPOT DOME -- WATER DISTRICT IN HERE SOMEWHERE AND BUNCH OF FAMILIAR -- FOLKS FROM THE PORT OF BILL AREA BUT AS A MATTER PRESIDENT I DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS -- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND SHOULD THE BILL NEED A COURTESY VOTE TODAY I'M PREPARED TO OFFER THAT. BUT AS A MATTER PRESIDENT AS A MATTER PARITY AND RESPONSIBILITY I THINK. SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS REMAIN AND I I KNOW YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK HARD ON THE MEASURE WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AND I KNOW THERE'S THERE'S OPENNESS TO SOLVING MANY PROBLEMS HERE BUT WE HAVE ANOTHER GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION BEING PROPOSED RAN CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. THINK OF A SIMILAR NUMBER FROM THE GENERAL FUND THAT STARTS DID ALMOST GET TOWARD TO BILLION -- THERE ARE THERE ARE -- BONDS ACTUALLY BEING PROPOSED RIGHT NOW AND LEGISLATURE SO THERE'S SOME OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL -- BUT AS WE KNOW YOU KNOW WITH PROP. THREE THIS WAS THE THIS WAS THE ALBATROSS SO -- I'M RETICENT TO REVISIT IT BUT IF THE IF MY VOTE IS NEEDED HERE TODAY I'M PREPARED TO OFFER THAT -- SO -- I WOULD JUST ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE WE'LL SEE WHERE WE LAND I WANT TO LET YOU CONTINUE TO WORK THIS PROCESS -- AND I'D APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM SO -- WITH THAT [inaudible] THESE QUOTES.

MY FAVORITE BILL THE DAY WHEN IT WELCOME CENTER [inaudible] AND WE'RE THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU. THERE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. MY FELLOW SENATORS AND AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY SAYING IN THANK YOU THANK YOU -- TO THE CHAIR AND AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WOULD LIKE TO START. THIS CONVERSATION ON POSITIVE THAT -- THE COMMITTEE IS HAS WORKED WITH MY STAFF AND AND WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL. I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS. THIS BILL SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FIVE HAS BEEN A CENTER OF OBVIOUSLY BENNY JOKES HERE IN THE CAPITAL. AND EVEN EVEN IN MY OWN HOME DOWN. BUT SERIOUSLY THIS GET DOWN TO REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT. THIS BILL IS DEALING DEALING WITH VERY VERY SERIOUS ISSUES IN A VERY SERIOUS MATTER. EACH YEAR IT IS ESTIMATED THAT OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DEAR ALONE OR KILLED. EVEN MORE ALARMING ACCORDING TO DATA GATHERED BY THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OVERALL I SIX YEARS APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND LARGE GAME AND AT LARGE GAME ANIMALS. HAD COLLISIONS AT THAT RESULTS IN OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED INJURIES. AND AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR FATALITIES TO MOTORISTS AND PASSENGERS ALIKE. THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AND MORE DATA IS NEEDED TO CREATE SAFER CORRIDOR FOR BOTH THE MOTORIST AND THE AND WILDLIFE. LARGE GAME ANIMALS. COLLISION TO AND CALIFORNIA ARE A MULTI FACETED PROBLEM AND CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS NO -- PROGRAMMATIC AB RESPONSE TO MITIGATE THESE OF AFFORDABLE THREATS TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY. THE ISSUE IS ONCE AGAIN PUBLIC SAFETY. FOR ONE THERE IS NO MECHANISM TRACTOR MAP HISTORICALLY DANGEROUS AREAS. WE KNOW THERE ARE AREAS IN THE STATE WERE MOTORIST AND LARGE GAME ANIMALS SPECIFICALLY DEER AND ELK ANIMAL. A MORE LIKELY. TO COME INTO CONTACT. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ACTIONABLE DATA IN THIS IS THE BIG ISSUE THIS WE CAN CHANGE. AND WE NEED TO KNOW THE OUTCOMES OF THAT DATA SECONDLY IN CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME SECTION CODE TWO ZERO ZERO THREE POINT FIVE PROHIBITS INDIVIDUALS. FROM REMOVING ANIMALS OUT OF THE ROADWAY BECAUSE OF THIS. ANIMALS ARE USUALLY LEFT IN THE ROADWAY AFTER THE COLLISION THIS IN TURN LEADS TO SECONDARY HAZARDS AND EVEN MORE COLLISIONS. NOT TO MENTION THE ADDED COST OF CALTRANS TO EVENTUALLY CLEAN UP THE ROAD. BY MAYOR IN THE LEGISLATION THAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE IN MANY STATES INCLUDING IDAHO MONTANA OREGON WASHINGTON AND ALASKA. SB THREE NINETY FIVE WILL ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. SENTE STATE BILL. NINETY FIVE WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. TO CREATE AN APP THAT WOULD ALLOW USERS TO LOG INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO LARGE GAME ANIMAL COLLISIONS. AT THE SAME TIME DELIVER PERMITS FOR THE TAKE THESE LARGE GAMES. THE REPORTING ASPECTS IT IS FUNDAMENTAL. TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. THREE NINETY FIVE AND THIS BILL AGAIN WILL PROVIDE CALTRANS AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES WITH A MEANS OF TRACKING VEHICLE WILDLIFE COLLISIONS SO THEY CAN ACCESS WHERE WILDLIFE HIGHWAY CROSSINGS ARE NEEDED. TO INCLUDE SIGN IS LIGHTING AND ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO MAKE THE ROADS SAFER. THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY AND OUR HIGHWAYS SAVE THOUSANDS OF DEER AND WILDLIFE. FROM ROAD RELATED DEATHS IN THE FUTURE AND PUT OTHERWISE WASTED LÃ  OUT -- WILDLIFE TO APPROPRIATE USE. FEEDING THOSE IN NEED. WITH NO OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL. N. THIS IS TRULY A WIN WIN BILL. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR BIBLE. A SENATOR -- WE WIN ASSISTANCE OF YES AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO ADD WITH ME THAT I HAVE SENATOR BILL HANSEL. WHO CARRIED THE SAME BILL IN HIS HOME STATE OF OREGON AND DOCTOR FRAZIER SHELLING FROM OUR OWN STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AT? AND AND POLICY HERE AT UC DAVIS VERY GOOD THANK YOU SIR PLEASE PROCEED SENATOR WELCOME. YOUR STERN ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS BILL HANSEL. OREGON STATE CENTER REPRESENTING DISTRICT TWENTY NINE LOCATED IN EASTERN OREGON. I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TESTIFYING ON SENATE BILL. THREE NINETY FIVE THERE ARE AS YOU AWARE TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS THE SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FIVE MY TESTIMONY WILL FOCUS ON ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS. I WAS CHIEF SPONSOR OF A SUMMER BILL SENATE BILL. THREE SEVEN TWO IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OREGON LEGISLATURE WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY TWO HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS SUCCESS CONCERNING THE SALVAGING OF DEER AND ELK KILLED ON OREGON ROADWAYS. BECAUSE MY FIRST NAME IS BILL. WHEN SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY TWO WAS WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE OREGON LEGISLATURE? I WAS KNOWING KNOWN AS ROAD KILL BILL. IF THIS STAYED WITH ME AS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN HELPING WAS SENATE BILL. THREE NINETY FIVE WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER VERY CREATIVE NEWS ARTICLES ON THE BILL SEARCHES GRILL THE GRILL OR MEALS ON WHEELS. BUT BUT THE BILL WAS ABSOLUTELY GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. IN A PASSED OUT OF BOTH OREGON CHAMBERS UNANIMOUSLY. WE DID OUR HOMEWORK AND WORKED OUT THE DIFFERENT ISSUES SUCH AS LIABILITY SAFETY TIMELINESS DATA COLLECTION FOR THE OREGON DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ANTLERS ROAD RIGHT AWAY HUMANE DISPATCH OF WOUNDED ANIMALS. APPS FOR THE PERMIT RULES FOR HARVESTING AND OTHER ISSUES. SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THROUGH MARCH TWO HUNDRED AND TEN PERMITS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE DEER. AND FORTY NINE NOW CAD BEEN ISSUED AVERAGING OVER TO PERMITS A DAY. ALL THESE GAME ANIMALS WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT TO ROT ALONGSIDE THE OREGON HIGHWAY PREVIOUSLY. ONE VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF WHAT WE DID IN OREGON WAS. WE DIDN'T REINVENT THE WHEEL. AS WE BEGIN OUR RESEARCH WE DISCOVERED TWENTY STATES ALREADY HAD PASS ROAD KILL BILLS. THEY SPAN THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM FROM LIBERAL VERMONT. TO CONSERVATIVE WYOMING. IN CRAFTING SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY TWO WE WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT OUR THREE NORTHWEST NEIGHBORS WASHINGTON IDAHO AND MONTANA. WITHOUT APOLOGY WE INCORPORATED MUCH OF WHAT THE STATE'S ALREADY HAD ON THE BOOKS. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY TWO YOU ARE IN ESSENCE LOOKING AT WHAT OTHER WESTERN STATES HAVE FOUND SUCCESSFUL. IT IS FOR THAT REASON I'VE FLOWN HERE AT MY OWN EXPENSE. MISSING TWO DAYS OF THE OREGON LEGISLATIVE SESSION. TO TESTIFY FOR TWO MINUTES. BECAUSE I WANT TO BE OF HELP AS OTHER STATES WERE TO ME. IN CRAFTING GOOD PUBLIC POLICY ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. IT IS MY BEEN MY PLEASURE AND HONOR TO MEET WITH CENTER ARCHULETA AND HIS STAFF. AND ALL IN MY STAFF WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE AS SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FIVE WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU CENTER HANSEL AND AND HOW TO RESPECT THE AB THREE MINUTES TO MAKE. YOU MADE YOU MADE THE TREK SOUTH. THANK YOU SIR. DR. THIS AUTOMATIC YEAH YOU'RE ON A DOCTOR PHASES SELLING UC DAVIS DIRECTS THE ROAD APOLOGY CENTER AND IN THAT -- CAPACITY WE ENGAGE. ROAD ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH RIGHT CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE WORLD -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE A ROAD KILL MONITORING SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S IN ITS TENTH YEAR AND WE ARE THE MAJOR SUPPLIER OF THAT KIND OF DATA TO CALTRANS DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE AND OTHER CLIENTS -- SO THERE'S ALREADY AN APP THERE THAT WE COULD USE FOR THIS KIND OF REPORTING -- JUST TO KEEP US ALL ON THE SAME PAGE THE STATISTICS THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER AT LEAST TWENTY THOUSAND DEER KILLED HERE ON CALIFORNIA ROADWAYS THAT'S BASED ONLY ON CLAIMS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. FOR THOSE WHO CAN THINK THAT WENT THROUGH THERE A LOT OF DEER THAT ALSO HAD THAT AREN'T THERE'S NO CLAIM ASSOCIATED AND IN OTHER STATES THAT CAN BE UP TO FOUR TIMES AS MANY. DEER OR LARGE ANIMALS ARE HIT THAT ARE ACTUALLY REPORTED WHICH MEANS THAT TWENTY THOUSAND IS OUR BASE LINE AND WE CAN GO UP TO EIGHTY THOUSAND POSSIBLE. THAT IS NOT PART OF ANY STATE MODELING OF DEER POPULATIONS AND COULD BE PART OF THE REASON WHY IN A LOT OF AREAS WE'VE SEEN DECLINES IN THIS VERY COMMON SPECIES. CALTRANS PICKS UP A TOP PROXIMALLY HUNDRED THOUSAND CARCASSES OF MEDIUM AND LARGE SIZE ANIMALS A YEAR FROM CALIFORNIA STATE HIGHWAYS. IN THE ESTIMATES FOR ROAD KILL IN THE UNITED STATES ARE ABOUT ONE MILLION ANIMALS PER DAY OR HIT. A CALIFORNIA USUALLY HAS ABOUT HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY. AS WAS NOTED WE DON'T HAVE ANY FORMAL STATE PROGRAM TO TREAT THIS PROBLEM. IT DOES COST US ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN PROPERTY DAMAGE LOSS OF WILDLIFE INJURY AND DEATH -- JUST IN CALIFORNIA -- SO ANY PROGRAM THAT CAN HELP US REDUCE THIS COST IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL THE PRIMARY BENEFIT I SEE OUT OF SB THREE NINETY FIVE IS IN THE DATA COLLECTION -- WE ARE AS I SAID WE ARE THE PRIMARY DATA PROVIDER FOR THE STATE. FOR WHILE THE VEHICLE COLLISION DATA ROAD KILL DATA. AND WE COULD ALWAYS USE MORE OF IT. IN OTHER STATES FOR EXAMPLE IDAHO WHERE THEY HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM -- AND THEIR ROAD KILL MONITORING PROGRAM IS MODELED AFTER HOURS -- THEY HAD ABOUT A 25% INCREASE IN THEIR DATA COLLECTION IN THE FIRST YEAR -- AND THEY HAVE NOT FACED ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUES IN THE USE THOSE DATA TO HELP MAKE DECISIONS -- I THINK THAT IF WE HAD A SIMILAR KIND OF DATA INGESTION DATA COLLECTION PROCESS HERE -- IT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING MITIGATE THIS CRITICAL IMPACT THAT AND I SAY CRITICAL BECAUSE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE. IT'S MY TO IN A MINUTE I KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS WHEN YOU HAD A LARGE ANIMAL ON A HIGHWAY -- BUT IT'S ALSO PREFER CRITICAL FOR WILDLIFE IN OUR STATE AGENCIES AND OTHER STATES HAVE RECOGNIZED THIS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF DEATH FOR WILDLIFE -- IS -- BEING HIT BY CARS THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU COULD [inaudible] THANK YOU. IF YOU DON'T MIND. STERN WE'VE ALREADY HAD MULTIPLE DOES MONEY IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST KEEP IT SURE OKAY. MY NEIGHBOR IN THE CLEVELAND I'M A RETIRED GAME WARDEN WITH THIRTY POINT FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME.

CHP CALTRANS THEY'VE BEEN MONITORING NEVER ONE OF THOSE HOT SPOTS DR SHILLINGS BEEN INVOLVED OF MOST RECENTLY BUT IT IS BECAUSE IT IS A CRITICAL. THING FOR US. TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT THIS DATA. THANK YOU SIR. JUST SO YOU KNOW I HAVE. BUT WE GOT WE GOT THE GIST AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE YES SIR. MISTER CHAIR BILL GAINES ON BEHALF OF THE BILL'S SPONSOR CALIFORNIA DEAR ASSOCIATION ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK FOUNDATION CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF WILD SHEEP.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RIGHT GRIFFITH ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS GO TO VINE FOR PLAN VISORS ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME WARDENS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE DATA COLLECTION ASPECTS OF THE BILL WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- IN REGARDS TO PUBLIC SAFETY BUT WE HAVE A TALK WITH AUTHORS OFFICE HE'S COMMITTED TO WORK WITH US AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEEN OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD WELCOME. HI JUDY MAN -- SO SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION FROM LAGUNA BEACH THIS IS JUST BEEN PUT ON OUR RADAR WE'RE GOING TO BE WATCHING THIS REAL CLOSELY. DATA COLLECTION IS A GOOD THING BUT WE SHOULD BE PROTECTING THE ANIMALS NOT WORRIED ABOUT HITTING -- IN ET NAM IT SEEMS INSANE I'M SORRY. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] SEEING NONE [inaudible] COMMENTS QUESTIONS [inaudible] QUIPS AND EASE UP ON THE QUIPS THE QUESTIONS ARE A CENTER ON OKAY SO I GUESS MY I WAS TRYING TO MAKE MY WAY THROUGH THE AMENDMENT SO I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND -- HOW THEY SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE BILL BUT I GUESS? MY MY A ONLY HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AS THE FIRST OF ALL HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THE BILL DOESN'T LEAD TO POACHING. I THINK THAT WAS AT THE HEART OF THE GAME WARDENS CONCERNS. YOU KNOW HAVING AB HUNTER SHOOTING ELK IN WE INTIMATES MENTIONS IN THE IN HOUSE IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY HARD TO GET THOSE TAGS. MAYBE THE SCENE ANIMAL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN MEANING TO THEY WANT. TO HI AND N. H. SHOOT IT MANY SAY WAS A BY A CAR. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE -- THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE HAPPENING ON TO THIS BILL. WELL THE CENTER DR TALKED WITH THE GAME WARDENS AND AND I'LL LET -- THE SENATOR TALK AS WELL. BUT IN MY CONVERSATION WITH THEM THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT IF AND WHEN THE ANIMALS IS HIT. IT IS OF OF PULLED TO THE SIDE AND THEY CAN TELL IF IT WAS POACHERS INVOLVED. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE THE WAY THE ANIMALS HIT WAS KILLED WHATEVER BUT DEADLY GAME WARDENS. ARE RIGHT ON IT AND SO THEY'VE TOLD ME THAT -- THAT IS SOMETHING THEY'RE LOOKING AT EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THEIR THEIR VERY MUCH IN TUNE WHICH TAKEN PLACE. AND THEY KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL TAKE CARE OF AS SOMEONE OPPOSED IT -- BUT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF KNOWING EXACTLY WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM. THE CROSSING THERE ARE HAVING THERE IS FEDERAL MONEY AND I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO MENTION THAT BUT FOR MONEY FOR OAK OVERPASSES SPECIFICALLY FOR THE ANIMALS AND THIS WILL PREVENT. ADDITIONAL -- COLLISIONS BUT AS FAR AS THE POACHING. THAT'S FOR THE GAME WORDS OF COMMAND THEY'RE THEY'RE ON IT SO THAT THEY CENTER L. IF I MAY WHAT WE DID IN OREGON IS THAT WE CAN FIND THE SALVAGE OPPORTUNITY. TO THE ROAD RIGHT AWAY. SO -- IF SOMEBODY WENT IN THE HIGH COUNTRY AND AND KILL AN ANIMAL OR POSTED -- AND DRUG IT ALL THE WAY BACK TO A ROAD AND THEN WENT ON THE APP TO GET IT -- IT SEEM LIKE A POACHERS DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT EXT. MORE LIKELY JUST TO TAKE IT HOME WE WE WORKED WITH -- THE F. AND W. R. DEPARTMENT FISH WILDLIFE REALIZE THAT -- YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO KEEP POACHING FROM HAPPENING. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY -- NOTHING IS GOING TO BE A FOOL PROOF ON THAT WHAT DOES IT BUT IT RAISES THE PROBLEM HERE. THAT I'M. YOU CAN GO YOU CAN CHANGE THE ANIMAL IF IT'S HIT BY THE CAR AND I MEAN YOU. YOU KNOW. BUT ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS WHERE WHAT HAPPENS AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IS PRIVATE PROPERTY. WHAT IF THE ANIMAL WALKS FIFTY FEET ON THE PRIVATE PROPERTY BEFORE FALLING? WHICH DID YOU WANTED BLOOD UNTRAINED UNLICENSED PERSON TO GO OUT AND YOU KNOW. FIRE GUN ON THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY IN. IN ARBIL IN OREGON YOU COULD NOT SELL HE SAID IF -- GET OFF THE ROAD RIGHT AWAY YOU CAN SALVAGE. BUT IN THIS BILL IT SEEMS TO BE STILL PERMITTED NOW. NO THE IDEA IS THAT IF AGAIN IF THE COLLISION HERS IN AN AT THE ANIMAL KEEPS GOING. THE IDEAS WITH THE APT TO RECORD EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE DATA. TO ENSURE WE KNOW OR THE THE ANIMALS COME TOGETHER AND EVENTUALLY THAT THE ROVER PAST COULD BE BUILT THAT'S THE IDEA. AND AGAIN THAT FOR THE FISH WILDLIFE THE GAME WARDENS THEY KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE EXPERTS AT THIS AND IF AND IF SOMEONE POACH THEY CAN TELL AS AN ANIMAL WAS -- BROUGHT ON TO THE ROADSIDE THEY KNOW THAT SHOW -- EVERY EVERYTHING BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN LOOKED AT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FOLLOW THE REST OF THE STATE'S THE THINGS THAT THAT WE'RE DOING AND THAT'S WHY. SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO THE BILL TO GO TAKE IT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD -- HAVE ALREADY BEEN LOOKED AT JOE AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT -- YOU HAD MENTIONED ABOUT SHOOTING. THE THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE LOSS OF THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW PERTAINING TO SOMEONE. CARRYING A HANDGUN OR CARRYING A RIFLE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE -- PEOPLE STILL HAVE TO BE LICENSED TO CARRY HAND GOT. SO THAT THAT IS NOT AN ISSUE. GOOD DOESN'T DEVIATE FROM THAT DATA. OF THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS. I ASKED THE CASHIER THE COMMITTEE DID UST. GIVE ME A SENSE OF OF HOW THE I'M AMENDMENTS MAY HAVE ADDRESS TO GO TO THE FIFTH AMENDMENT GO TO PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS OKAY THIS IS WHAT SENATOR ARCHULETA I BELIEVE WAS REFERRING TO SO. ON PAGE FOR A MINUTE UNTIL PAGE TEN THE NOW SYSTEM AND FIVE ALL STATE AND LOCAL LAWS OF A AND AND REGULATIONS APPLY WITH THE EXCEPTION. OF THE REQUIREMENT TO POSSESS A VALID HUNTING LICENSE IN APPLICABLE TAG SO IN OTHER WORDS. A LOG -- BARRING DISCHARGE A FIRE ARM ON THE ON A STATE ROAD -- TRESPASSING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY -- SO SO THE THE CHAIN THE REAL SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE IN LAW THAT. I CAN SPEAK FOR CENTER ARCHER LETTER THE SEEKING IS THAT. THAT HUNTING LICENSE AND TAG REQUIREMENTS FOR ANIMALS STRUCK ON THE ROADS -- BUT BEYOND THAT -- I DON'T THINK THAT THERE ANY FURTHER CHANGES BEING MADE I I WILL SAY I DO I DO SHARE YOUR TREPIDATION ABOUT. YOU KNOW SOME OPEN DOOR -- TO POACHING THAT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED HERE AND I I KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON TRYING -- TO IT IS TIED UP ANY POTENTIAL LOOPHOLES IN THIS THAT THAT MIGHT LEAD TO THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE YOU KNOW. WE DON'T WE WE WANT TO BE FULL PROOF WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE THAT'S WHAT WE ENDEAVOR TO DO HERE. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WITH THE AMEND WE'VE ADDED UP MUCH MORE DISCRETION ALSO TO I BELIEVE THE FISHING GAME. COMMISSION -- TO PUT UP UP UP PROGRAM TOGETHER THAT WOULD DETER THAT KIND OF IMPACT BUT IF THE CENTERS UP FOR WILL WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER AND AND MAKE SURE THAT -- THIS DOESN'T HIT THE FLOOR IN SOME FORM THAT'S GOING TO HAVE -- SOME OPEN BACKED OR BECAUSE I I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS IN THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WAIT IN LINE BY THE WAY TO DO THIS RIGHT THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO GET. SOME OF THESE TAGS AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT ANY -- NO FALSE POSITIVES BEING REPORTED BUT I MEAN IF YOU WITH YOUR WITH YOUR APPS IS THERE A WAY TO CAPTURE AT LEAST. THE IMAGE IN THE DATA SUCH THAT YOU COULD DISTINGUISH FROM. A ROAD KILL VERSES A GUNSHOT IS THE IT OR IS THAT YOUR TO BE ON THE SCOPE OF THE APPS RIGHT NOW ABSOLUTELY AND THE FIRST REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE AN IMAGE AND YOU COULD PUT IN LAW THAT THE PART OF THE PERMIT REQUIREMENT IS THAT IT'S AN IDENTIFIABLE. ANIMAL ANIMAL AND YOU CAN TELL THAT IT WAS NOT SHOT. I MEAN THAT'S HARD TO PROVE AND YOU WOULD IF IN THE CASE OF AN ELK HAVING DFW ON HAND TO CHECK IT OUT OR HAVE SOME KIND OF FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF IT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS A COLLISION NOT APPROACHING EVENT WOULD BE. PROBABLY CRITICAL IN THE CASE OF DEAR THOSE A VERY CALM AND AND THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF DFW EFFORT -- BUT SURE IMAGERY IS THE BEST WAY TO TO DO THAT IT'S HARD TO BE HARD TO HIDE -- THAT NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT AT WET IDAHO FOUND BECAUSE THEY HAD SIMILAR KINDS OF CONCERNS TEN YEARS AGO WAS THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF POACHING OR ADDITIONAL PROTEIN BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF POACHING IN CALIFORNIA -- AND THEY DID NOT FIND EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO COVER UP PUSHING EVENTS USING THIS. THIS. NEW LAW WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY REPORTING -- AND ANYBODY WHO REPORTS HAS TO BE IDENTIFIED WHICH THEN KIND OF BREAKS THE FIRST RULE OF COMMITTING A CRIME IS THAT YOU DON'T IDENTIFY YOURSELF. SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS THAT IT JUST DOESN'T LEAD TO THAT HAPPENING AT LEAST THAT WAS IDAHO'S FINDING OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. BUT I THINK EMPIRE REPORTED TO THIS AND YOU TALK. TO THE IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME PERSON ABOUT THIS. VERY GOOD OTHER QUESTIONS. WELL I AM I GUESS I'M I'M JUST YOU KNOW TRUSTING THAT THE TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAVE -- REALLY YEAH VETTED THESE ISSUES IN OUR ARE GONNA BE MONITORING THEM YEAH BUT AS THE KICK OFF AS THE NOW SAYS NO TO TO WORK IN PROGRESS SOME OF THE FISHING GAME WARDEN CONCERNS RAISED -- LATE NOT AS IN OPPOSITION BUT AS SOME ISSUES TO WORK THROUGH. I HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR A WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. AS WELL AS WITH THE COMMITTEE IN MY RIGHT AND THAT IS AFTER RIGHT MISTER CHAIR REMEMBER WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND HERE IS HOW TO SAVE LIVES TWENTY FOUR FOR COUNTIES. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE A FAMILY IN A VAN AND THEY HIT THAT ANIMAL AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM FISHING GAME INTO IN THE WARDENS AND SO ON THAT ANIMAL WILL GO RIGHT THROUGH THAT WINDSHIELD AND KIDS IN THE BACKSEAT. A DAMAGE WE'VE HAD AS I SAID FIFTEEN HUNDRED INJURIES AND TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY. TO TO RECORD WHAT IS HAPPENING WHERE THE ANIMALS ARE COMING AND THAT'S THE IDEA. THE THOUGHT IS IF WE GIVE PEOPLE THIS RATE. THEY'RE GONNA BE MORE LIKELY. TO REMOVE THE ANIMAL FROM THE ROAD IN. THAT'S KIND OF THE CORE GOAL HERE THE THE THE IDEA IS GOD FORBID SOMETHING HAPPEN AND THEY HIT THE ANIMAL AND AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG HERE. 99% OF THE TIME THE AND WILL SIT IN THE FALLS TO THE SIDE IT DOESN'T NORMALLY STAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD FALL TO THE SIDE. AND IF PEOPLE GET OUT WHEN NORMALLY THEY SHOULD AND REPORT THE ACCIDENT IMMEDIATELY IN A MEETING HE GOES TO TO TO THE HIGHWAY PATROL TO CALTRANS. AND THE THE FISH AND GAME AND SO IT WAS TO DO THAT THAT THAT'S PART OF YOUR THAT'S THAT'S IT'S IN THERE SO THAT'S THE IDEA THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE APP. SO EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IT'S HAPPENED WHERE IT'S HAPPENED AND WHEN WE HAVE THE DATA FOR THE FUTURE AND THEN STARRED GATOR GETTING THIS DATA TOGETHER SO WE CAN TAKE THE NEXT COURSE OF ACTION IS. TO IF IT'S IT CONCENTRATED IN ONE AREA DAN THIS IS WHERE THE OVER PAST COULD BE BUILT. WHEN SOMEBODY HAD JUST? MENTIONED ABOUT THE ANIMALS THAT'S THE WAY TO ALSO SAY THE ANIMAL AND TO SAVE LIVES SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO BE LIKE A WILDLIFE COURT THE THE WILDLIFE TO WE'VE GOT TO BRING OVER WHAT'LL HAPPEN. IT IT'S THEY CREATE THIS FISHING I'M SORRY THIS FRENCH IN THAT KIND OF A V. SHAPE AND IT JUST HURDLE JUMP INTO. THE OVER PASS AND THAT THE IDEA. SO SUCCESSFUL OF LOCATION THE THE THE YOU WOULD SEE THE FENCES IN A V. SHAPE AND YOU WOULD SEE AT THE OVER PASS TO THE ANIMALS WILL GO RIGHT OVER THE TOP. ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT WOULD JUST BE TO REQUIRE DRIVERS. TO REPORT. ANIMAL RELATED ACCIDENTS JUST LIKE THEY WERE REQUIRED TO REPORT. EXCELLENT AND SOME PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY IF THE DAMAGES IS SO SEVERE THEY'RE GONNA THEY'RE GONNA OBVIOUSLY CALL THE HIVE JOYS THAT MENTION AND CALTRANS EVERYBODY ELSE THE AMBULANCES ROLL. THEY'LL TAKE YOUR THE THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED LIKE THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED INJURIES IT'S HAPPENING SO WE'VE GOT O FIND A WAY OF RECORDING IT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP. AND THAT'S WHY I'M OPEN TO AMENDMENTS AND AND AND AND FUTURE -- CONVERSATIONS TO MAKE IT -- A VIABLE WAY OF SAVING LIVES IN PREVENTING INJURIES AND WE CAN DO IT IN A IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY. THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THEY COULD JUST HIT THAT APP. EVERYONE WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND PEOPLE COULD ROLL ON THIS THING WHICH IS I WILL CONTROL. AND YOU WANTED TO YES SO THE CURRENTLY IS VERY DISCRETIONARY I MEAN YOU COULD PUT THAT REQUIREMENT IN BUT MOST OF THESE INCIDENTS ARE OCCURRING WITHOUT ANYBODY NEARBY. AND SO REQUIRING PEOPLE TO REPORT IS MAY BE LESS LIKELY TO SUCCEED IN GIVING THEM AN INCENTIVE NOT NOT TO INTERRUPT THE DOCTOR WE DID. PUT THAT REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO REPORT YES FOR ANYBODY'S REPORT TO IT'S AN ANIMAL. OUT THAT'S THAT'S NOW GOING TO BE PART ITS KEEPER THE DRIVER'S EDUCATION PROCESS OKAY. BUT RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S THE RIVER AND THROUGH THIS APP PROCESS YEAH. BUT I'VE GOT FREE REQUIRED TO HAVE THIS APP [inaudible] THE RIGHT SO ANY AGENCY IN OTHER WORDS THAT I BELIEVE IT'S AMENDMENTS. SORRY C. THROUGH ORIGIN AND YEAH. RIGHT SO IT'S NOT A MANDATE TO DOWNLOAD AN APP BUT IT'S A MANDATE FOR ANY STATE AGENCY DOING THE REMOVAL TO DOCUMENT THAT ON THE APP SO THE DEPARTMENT OF RIGHT BUT IS THE DEPARTMENT FISHING HAVE IN FISH AND WILDLIFE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING THE APP. THAN CALTRANS OR ANY OTHER STATE AGENCY THIS TO REMOVAL REQUIRED TO USE IT BUT AS FAR AS A CITIZEN REQUIREMENT -- THAT IS STILL. SOMEBODY WHO'S I'M IT SEEMS TO ME IF THE IF THE KEY ISSUE IS DATA COLLECTOR SO FOR CONSUMPTION IT'S MANDATORY IF ANYONE CAN ACTUALLY CONSUME IT BUT FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT BE CONSUMING IT THERE'S STILL A DISCRETION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT IS REPORTED. YES THAT'S HOW THE LAW WOULD ORK IF THIS WERE ENACTED IF WE GOT A A MAJOR DATA COLLECTION ISSUE SHOULD WE MAKE IT MANDATORY. REPORTING I'M IS A IS THAT IT DID YOU YOU HAVE TO REPORT OF A ANY KIND OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENT IN. WE REQUIRE PEOPLE TO REPORT TO PUT ON PUT ON THEIR NGUYEN SCREAM WHEN THEY'VE. GAINED ANOTHER CAR EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE EVERY INCENTIVE TO NOT DO SO BUT WE WE MAKE THAT THE LAN WHAT MOST PEOPLE COMPLY -- IS. IT THAT THE OTHER JEWISH URINATED YEAH BUT THAT'S PART OF IT THE OTHER PART IS THAT IS WASTE -- TO HIT AN ANIMAL AND NOT DO ANYTHING WITH IT AND ALL OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED THE DRIVING AROUND AND MOST OF US HAVE HAD PROBABLY HIT SOMETHING. IT'S THE WASTE AFTER THE FACT YEAH IT'S A WASTED OPPORTUNITY TO REPORT YOU KNOWN LOCATE THOSE SO THAT WE CAN MITIGATE THE THE IMPACT. BUT IS ALSO YOU'VE STILL GOT A DEAD ANIMAL YOU ARE GONNA HAVE SECONDARY EFFECTS IS GONNA BE SCAVENGERS THAT SHOW UP THEY COULD ALSO GET KILLED THAT'S A VERY COMMON THING -- SO IT'S BOTH PREVENTING FUTURE ACCIDENTS IS PREVENTING ACCIDENTS RIGHT AFTERWARDS DUE TO THE SCAVENGERS -- THIS OFFER AND FAMILY MEMBERS THIS IS I MEAN DEAR WILL HANG OUT NEAR ONE DEAR THEY GOT KILLED. STAY RIGHT NEXT TO THE ROAD -- SOMETIMES ON THE ROAD THERE'S A LOT OF BY A LOT OF I GET DOWN TO GO WITH IT BUT SO IT'S NOT JUST THE REPORTING IT'S ALSO THE WAY SAYS THE ANIMALS INDICT YOU KNOW. WE HAVE THE BETTER FOR TO YOU KNOW FOR TO BE EATEN -- BUT I I SO I I I I I SEE THAT YOU'RE THE TENTS IN THE MIDEAST KIND OF DELVING INTO SOME OF THE STUFF I YEAH THE AUTHORS HEARING IT. I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME. WE WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD INCREASE COACHING I UNDERSTAND THE DATE IS GOOD OUT OF IDAHO BUT YOU WE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T. ALLOW FOR AN OPENING THERE AND I I DO THINK THAT THIS DOES CONTINUE TO RAISE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT. I YOU KNOW WE ALL I THINK YOU ALL IN YOUR MIND TO HAVE THIS. CLEAN SITUATION OF OF WHERE WORD THIS CLEARLY ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD NOT CLEAN. BUT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. I IF IF YOU'RE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO GIVE CHASE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU'RE ENDING UP ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. WHAT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET OFF OF THE ROAD I MEAN WE KNOW WHAT WHERE DO WE WHERE WE MAKE SURE THAT WERE? ARE NOT OPENING UP A WHOLE BUNCH OF PANDORA'S BOX HERE IS. TO WELL HERE COMMITMENT TODAY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. YES VENN TO ANY POTENTIAL BACK DOORS ON POACHING. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH MORE DETAILS IN THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT HOW THE MECHANICS IS SHOULD ACTUALLY WORK. AND I WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION FROM SENATOR MONEY -- LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY. THE THE BROADER POINT YOU MADE ABOUT WILDLIFE CORRIDORS BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF PREVENTION IS CRITICAL SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO PARTNERING WITH YOU NOT JUST ON DEALING WITH THINGS AFTER THE BAD. AT THE ACCIDENT HAPPENS WHICH WE WANT TO PREVENT MORE OF BUT UNTIL THAT ROOT CAUSE TO IN HELPING GET THESE WILDLIFE. OUT OF OUR ROADWAYS IN INTO SAFE. I'D SAY FOR LIFE SO THERE'S A MOTION -- I'VE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. TO APPROPRIATIONS ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE SENATOR.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST I THOUGHT I THINK SOMEONE JUST SPOKE ON MY BEHALF I DUG HOUSTON REPRESENTED THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT THIS BILL REPRESENTS A REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE OPTION. TO PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN EMBROILED IN IN DECADES OF CONTROVERSY IN THE TO SEE THIS BILL BEFORE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. THE SCENE NO OTHERS IN SUPPOT. IS THAT RIGHT NORTHERN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION. OR TRAINERS. ARE WELCOME. OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TERRY MAKAYLA THERE AND READ NECESSITY THAT'S REPRESENTING A CONSORTIUM OF OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION STE. WE OPPOSE THIS BILL A VERY SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR. PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE RESOLUTELY THAN I INTENDED. I THINK THAT -- WE'RE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL FOR THREE REASONS ONE IS THAT IT CREATES A NEW LEVEL. OF SCRUTINY BY. STATE PARKS WHICH COULD IMPACT ANY KIND OF LAND PURCHASES THAT THEY HAVE. TO THAT THE BILL IS REALLY ONLY HALF WRITTEN. IT GIVES A PRESCRIPTION AS TO WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEPARTMENT DOES THIS -- HEARING THAT THEY SHOULD SELL THE PROPERTY AND WHAT THE PROPERTY COULD BE SOLD. FOR HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT. I THINK THAT THE SENATORS A VERY CONSCIENTIOUS AND PRAGMATIC PERSON. AND IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING WE ARE GOING TO HEAR THIS BILL EVERY SINGLE YEAR UNTIL I DIE. MY SUGGESTION AND THIS IS A SUGGESTION AND I I RAN IT BY. MISTER CRAVEN JUST BRIEFLY. IS THE IDEA THAT WE DO SOMETHING WE'RE BOTH PARTIES HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME. CLEARLY [inaudible] PARKS. I WAS VERY CAREFUL IN SETTING THIS PARK ASIDE THERE WERE THE PUBLIC HEARINGS THERE'S A HISTORY OF MOTORCYCLE RIDING HERE. THERE'S A NECESSITY FOR A PARK IN THIS AREA. HOWEVER IF THEY DIDN'T DO EVERYTHING AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED. TO MY SUGGESTION IS. IT HAS NO VESTED INTEREST IN THIS. IF WE DO IT WITH PARKS WHICH IS KIND OF THE SAME HEARINGS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANYWHERE. AN ARBITRATOR TO LOOK AT AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF PUTTING THIS PROJECT TOGETHER. IF THEY DECIDE THAT PARKS DID EVERYTHING CORRECTLY THAT THERE IS A NEED. THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE NEARBY EITHER SIGNED OFF OR WERE GIVEN EASEMENTS IN THE PROCESS IN THE PROCESS. OF THE PROJECT GOES FORWARD. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT IT IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT THERE ARE REASONS ENVIRONMENTAL OR FOR WHATEVER BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THEN THE PROPERTY SHOULD BE SOLD. THEN IT SHOULD BE SOLD AT THE PRICE BUT IT'S WORTH RIGHT NOW WE WOULDN'T WANT TO GET ANYBODY INTO TROUBLE BY MAKING THIS A GIFT OF PROPERTY FROM THE STATE SO WE COULD. GET UP AN APPROPRIATE PRICE AND AND GET RID OF IT THAT WAY. I WILL CLOSE JUST BY SAYING THIS I WANTED TO CONGRATULATE THE COMMITTEE SECRETARY AND WELCOME HER INTO THE WINDOW THE GRANDMOTHER RANKS. AND THERE'S A NEW GRANDFATHER ACTUALLY TELL YOU IT'S IT'S THE GREATEST AND IT'S IT IS THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN FOR A WHEN WE SPEAK THANK YOU. DIANA MEAD WITH CALIFORNIA OFF ROAD VEHICLE ASSOCIATION. SENATORS AND STAFF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THIS MOMENT IN TIME TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT SB. SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN I AM A PROUD DEMOCRAT. I SERVE ON THE BOARD OF A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION. AND I ADVOCATE FOR ACCESS -- FOR A TO BE RECREATION. SENATOR GLAZER IS MY SENATOR. SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN IS VERY SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR'S SB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN A BILL I ALSO OPPOSED. ONCE AGAIN. OUR LEGISLATIVE RESOURCES ARE BEING USED. TO INTERCEDE IN A LOCAL ISSUE. SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN ATTEMPTS TO CREATE AN AVENUE FOR THE SALE OF A PARTICULAR PARCEL OF STATE PARKS OWN PROPERTY. IT ALSO SINGLES OUT. A PARTICULAR RECREATION AND THOSE WHO ENJOY IT. OFF HIGHWAY MOTORIZED RECREATION. WHEN ASKED WHY HE INTRODUCED THIRTEEN SIXTEEN MY SENATOR VOLUNTEERED? THE PROPERTY WILL NEVER HAVE A WAY TO BE. THE LAWSUITS WILL KEEP COMING. AND THEY'RE COSTLY WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS. WELL THOSE ARE NOT HIS EXACT WORDS THAT IS THE GIST. NOW ALL LAWMAKERS RECOGNIZE THE LAWSUITS ARE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF SYKORA. WHAT MY SENATOR IS NOT UNDERSTANDING? IS MANY OF THE GROUPS TO SUPPORT SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN WILL NOT STOP ATTACKING O. H. B. IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. IF THIS PROPERTY IS SOLD. THERE'S A LENGTHY DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF EFFORTS TO SHUT DOWN CARNEGIE AS WE ARE A SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW FOR THE SALE OF PROPERTY PURCHASED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PURCHASE WAS FOR EXPANDING CARNEGIE S. V. R. A.. ENHANCING BOTH MOTOR I IS AN END NON MOTORIZED RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS PARK. THIS PURCHASE WAS NOT A SECRET. ADJACENT LANDOWNERS WERE THE BENEFICIARIES OF DISCLOSURE. OF COURSE THE BILL WILL NOT FORCE THE STATE PARKS TO SELL THE PROPERTY [inaudible] BUT SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN UNDERMINES THE STATE PARKS. AND THE LEVEL OF STEWARDSHIP THIS DEPARTMENT BRINGS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. STATE PARKS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET A HIGHER STANDARD THAN REGIONAL COUNTY OR CITY PARKS. SB. TWO FORTY NINE THE OFF HIGHWAY MOTOR VEHICLE RECREATION BILL PASSED INTO LAW IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DEFINES REQUIREMENTS FOR S. V. R. A.'S TO MEET EVEN MORE RIGOROUS ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. INCLUDING THOSE APPLIED TO HABITAT. AND SOIL EROSION [inaudible] SO. SB. SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN POSES TO SAVE THIS PARCEL. FROM THE VERY DIVISION OF STATE PARKS THAT WILL OFFER THE GREATEST. PROTECTION [inaudible] IRONIC. TO DATE STATE PARKS IS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT DOLLARS TO MITIGATE IMPROVE AND PROTECT THE EXPANSION PROPERTY. SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN DOES NOT CREDIT STATE PARKS FOR THE TWENTY YEARS OF LAND PREPARATION FOR PUBLIC USE. SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN DOES NOT INDICATE. THAT A FUTURE OWNER WILL EVEN ALLOW PUBLIC ACCESS. BUT IF THEY DO. MONEY WILL NEED TO BE MITIGATED NEED TO BE A ALLOCATED FOR MITIGATION ON AN EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS MINING OPERATION. IF THEY DON'T PLAN FOR PUBLIC ACCESS OR FIND THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. AND INSTEAD PLACE THE PROPERTY INTO CONSERVATOSHIP. ALLOWING GRAZING PERHAPS THERE ARE NO REQUIRED PROTECTIONS FOR NATURAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES AS MANDATED BY STATE PARKS. IGN'S HERE TO WRAP UP WHEN YOU GET HERE OKAY THANKS AND OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY WILL HAVE LOST ACCESS FOR MANY. WELL THE SUPPORTERS OF SB SEVEN SIX SEVEN AN ISSUE OF LOCAL CONCERN IS TAKEN ON THE PROFILE OF PRECEDENT SETTING STATEWIDE BILL. IT COULD BE YOUR PARK. AND THEY WILL HAVE PRESIDENT NEXT TIME NOT JUST THE OPTIONS ONE LINE. THIS PARTICULAR OFF ROADER URGES YOU NOT TO ENDORSE EVEN AS A COURTESY A DEVICE OF LOCAL MATTER WITH ROOTS IN THEM BE ISM. VERY OBVIOUS BIAS AGAINST -- HV. SHOULD NOT CARRY THE DAY. ALLOW SB TWO FORTY NINE TO WORK AS THIS BODY LEGISLATED IN APPROVED. LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO. RESPECT AND SUPPORT STATE PARKS.

I SEE NO THERE'S AN OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DÃ­AS COMMENTS QUESTIONS. CONCERNS CENTER CARRIER. YEAH I GUESS I'M I'M JUST CONCERNED WITH THEM. I AND I KNOW SENATOR GLACIER AND I KNOW -- DBM PRETTY REASONABLE AND PRAGMATIC TYPE OF PERSON -- AS THE AS WAS STATED -- BUT THIS IS A A LOCAL ISSUE AND IT DISTURBS ME TO HAVE. TO DO THE PROVERBIAL SOLOMON SPLITTING UP THE BABY -- DON'T MIND TAKING TOUGH VOTES I JUST -- I'M JUST NOT SURE IT MAKES SENSE. TO TAKE RESOURCES. THAT WERE GENERATED BY -- ONE ACTIVITY. ALLOW THEM TO MAKE THE PURCHASE AND THEN. NUMBER OF YEARS DOWN THE ROAD DECIDE THAT. THAT PURCHASE WAS. NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY. AFTER THE FACT AND THEN. TAKE AWAY THAT RESOURCE SO I'M I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN ADDRESS ALL OF THEM I'M LOOKING FOR A COMPROMISE I GUESS IS WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO AND I'M NOT SURE THERE'S ONE TODAY. BUT BUT I AM CONCERNED. THE CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YEARS YOUR QUESTION. FIRST TO BE CLEAR NOTHING IN THIS BILL REQUIRES THE LAND TO BE SOLD. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION IS GOING TO THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO A BILL TO AN EXTENSION OF AN EXISTING OFF HIGHWAY THAT OUGHT THAT EXISTING OFF HIGHWAY. CONTINUES ON NO MATTER WHAT THIS BILL THAT HAPPENS OR DOESN'T HAPPEN. THERE'S AN AREA VAST AREA THAT HAS THIS ACTIVITY AND THIS DOESN'T AFFECT IT ONCE WHATSOEVER ALL THIS SAYS IS THAT THE ADDITIONAL EXPANSION THAT THEY ACQUIRED. IF THEY DECIDE THAT IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF THE STATE AND OF THE OFF ROADERS TO SAY THAT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE IN LITIGATION FOREVER. THIS GIVES THEM THE OPTION TO SELL AND GET ALL THE MONEY BACK INTO THE OFF ROAD FUND. RIGHT BACK INTO THE OFFERED SO THEY CAN FIND OTHER USES OF IT THAT CAN A EXPAND THAT ACTIVITY IN OTHER PLACES -- THAT THEY DEEM FIT THAT'S ALL IT REALLY DOES CREATES AN OPTION STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT SAID WE CAN'T DO THAT AS AN OPTION UNLESS YOU PASS THIS BILL THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS HERE. WAS NOT MEANT TO SAY YOU LOVE IT OR YOU HATE IT YOU LIKE THIS LOCATION YOU DOWN IT GIVES THE STATE DEPARTMENT. OF PARKS AND OPTION THEY DON'T HAVE TODAY THAT'S ALL REALLY DOES. THERE WAS A RECOMMENDATION OF FINDING AN NEUTRAL THIRD PARTY. MEDIATOR ARBITRATOR HAVE CERNEY CURRENCY TO THAT IDEA. I HAD NOT HEARD THE SPECIFICS OF THAT IDEA UNTIL TODAY I'M AYE. AS I AM ON ANY ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION ALWAYS OPEN TO FIND COMMON GROUND. AS A CERTAINLY WOULD WELCOME I THE CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE ON THAT SUBJECT BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IF THERE WERE AN ARBITRATION [inaudible] THE REACH SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA THE BILL PROPOSES IT MIGHT STILL TAKE. THE LEGISLATION. I DON'T KNOW THAT AN ARBITRATOR CONVINCE THE POWER IN DEPARTMENT OF PARKS. NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF AT PARKS EVEN IF PARKS WANTED TO SELL TODAY AND THAT WAS THE CHOICE OF AN ARBITRATOR OR ANY -- ANYBODY ELSE INCLUDING THE COMMISSION -- THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO DO IT UNDER THE ADVICE FROM THE PARKS DEPARTMENT THIS SIMPLY GIVES IN THAT CHOICE. YOU COULD HAVE THIS BILL ENACTED AND THEY COULD ALSO IN A BRING AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO KIND OF WORK OUT THE CONCERNS AND PROBLEMS IN THAT. THAT'S THAT WOULD ALL BE GOOD THIS BILL WOULD AFFECT THAT IN ANY WAY IT WOULD SIMPLY GIVE THEM THE IN AN OPTION IF THEY CHOSE TO GO. IN THE DIRECTION TRYING TO GET THE MONEY BACK. THANK YOU AN ARM I AM TO BE SUPPOTIVE TODAY BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE EXPLORATION OF THAT PATH FOR THE LOCAL. ENGAGEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS THANKS VERY GOOD.

FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT PRESENT A VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE A MEASURE THAT GETS. TO THE KIND OF COMMUNITY THAT WE WANT TO LIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FUTURE AND ANNA AND A MESSAGE OF OF YOU KNOW HOW WE EDUCATE HOW WE INTEGRATE WITH WITH WITH NATURE. AND HOW WE EDUCATE OUR KIDS ON ON HOW TO INTEGRATE WITH NATURE. THIS BILL IS IS A BILL THAT -- TRY TO PROTECT WILD ANIMALS. IN OUR STATE. ARE THOSE BEARS TIGERS ELEPHANTS THAT ARE SUBJECTED TO HAVING TO RIDE BICYCLES AND JUMP JUMP THROUGH FIFTH BLAMING HOOPS. AND TO RIDE TRAPEZE EN TO BALANCE ON PEDESTALS AND WHATEVER ELSE THEY MAKE THEM DO THAT IS JUST NOT NOT. DOES NOT COME NATURAL TO THEM AND COMES AT ENORMOUS COST. TO THEIR WELL BEING. THEY PERFORM THESE THESE AMAZING TRICKS BECAUSE THEY ARE INTELLIGENT. BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF WHAT THEY WHAT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM IF THEY DON'T. HOW TO FORCE ANIMALS TO PERFORM THESE TRICKS CIRCUS TRAINERS ABUSE THEM WITH WHIPS MUSCLES ELECTRIC HOT? RODS BULL HOOKS [inaudible] AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS THAT CAUSE THEM PAIN AND CAUSE THEM -- EMOTIONAL ABUSE. THIS IS NOT ONLY A ON AN OF ANIMAL WELFARE ISSUE BUT IT'S ALSO A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE WHEN. ANIMALS ARE OFTEN WILD ANIMALS ARE OFTEN PUSHED TO THE LIMIT. THE A. H. IT AFFECTS THEIR BEHAVIOR -- ELEPHANTS HAVE BEEN IN PREVIOUS INSTANCES OUT ELEPHANTS HAVE BOLTED FROM CIRCUSES THEY'VE RUN AMOK TO THE STREETS. CRASHED INTO BUILDINGS ATTACK MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AN INJURED AND KILLED HANDLERS WITHOUT OSTRICHES. RUNNING LOOSE LIONS AND TIGERS BEARS. ANIMALS THAT ARE JUST SIMPLY FLEEING FOR THEIR WORK SAFETY. THIS MEASURE RECOGNIZES BOTH THE ON WELL ANIMAL WELFARE CONCERNS IT'S PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS. OF CIRCUSES ANOTHER TRAVELING SHOWS OF FORCE WILD OR EXOTIC ANIMALS. TO PERFORM. WE HAVE WITH US TODAY A JURY MAN CRUISER WITH A SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION. AND UP DEL SIENNA WINDER IS FROM A PIZZA. AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE THEM MAKE SOME COMMENTS AS TO WHY THIS BILL IS NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. IF YOU ALLOW THAT MISTER CHAIR. GLADLY THANK YOU CENTER WELCOME. THESE. THANK YOU. I AM DEL SANTA WINTERS I AM VICE PRESIDENT AND DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE PIZZA FOUNDATION AND I AM ALSO ADJUNCT FACULTY OF VERMONT LAW SCHOOL EIGHTIES ANIMAL WELFARE LAW. AS SENATOR HUESO INDICATED ANIMALS DON'T PERFORM TRICKS ON COMMAND IN CIRCUSES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO THEY DO SO BECAUSE THEY ARE TERRIFIED OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF THEY DON'T. PETER HAS DOCUMENTED REPEATEDLY THAT THESE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THROUGH VICIOUS BEATINGS BEHIND THE SCENES WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THEY DON'T OBEY. AND THEY SPEND MUCH OF THEIR LIVES MANY CONSECUTIVE HOURS AND SOMETIMES DAYS ON END CONFINED IN CRAMPS FERRON TRAILERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS TREATMENT THEY CAN LASH OUT AND ANIMALS HAVE. ANIMALS ISN'T SERVICES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS HUMAN INJURIES AND EVEN HUMAN DEATH. OVER MY PAST DECADE A PRACTICING AND TEACHING ANIMAL LAW. THE TOTAL FAILURE OF OUR EXISTING LAWS BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL TO PROTECT ANIMALS IN CIRCUSES AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM THEM HAS BEEN A CONSTANT THEME. THE FEDERAL ANIMAL WELFARE FAIR ACT WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE ENFORCED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE IS A TOTAL FARCE IT'S THAT'S ONLY BARE MINIMUM STANDARDS BUT TOTALLY FAILED TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE. NEEDS OF WILD ANIMALS AND OTHER ANIMALS IN CIRCUSES. AND FAIL TO ADDRESS UNIQUE SUFFERING POSED BY THE CONSTANT CONFINEMENT AND PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT IS ANIMALS SPACE. IN ADDITION THE ANIMAL FACT IS WOEFULLY UNDER AND FORCE THE USDA'S OWN OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS REPEATEDLY DOCUMENTED THESE ENFORCEMENT FAILINGS. EVEN WITH CIRCUS EXHIBITORS NEGLECT AND ABUSE RESULTS IN DEATH TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS. THEY'RE ALLOWED TO STAY IN BUSINESS THIRD LICENSES ARE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED AT BEST THEY'RE GIVEN A TINY SLAP ON THE WRIST IN THE FORM OF A MONETARY PENALTY THAT'S TREATED AS A COST OF DOING BUSINESS. CALIFORNIA'S PERMITTING PROCESS DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS EITHER AT THE GUIDELINES FAILED TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE COMPLEX NEEDS OF THESE ANIMALS AND HOLY FELL TO ADDRESS PUBLIC SAFETY. FOR THESE REASONS I ASK YOU TO VOTE YES ON SB THREE THIRTEEN TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED PROTECTION FOR ANIMALS USED IN CIRCUSES AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC THANK YOU. Q. IF I GET TO ADD DOES OF FINES AND PENALTIES ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE TO THE THE FOUR WHEREAS LEAVE FINANCING OUR THEIR PENALTIES CRUELTY.

THIS CIRCUS CALIFORNIA BASED CIRCUS VARGAS DID THE RIGHT THING AND JOIN THE EVER GROWING LIST OF ANIMAL FREE CIRCUSES AND IS NOW THRIVING. IN FACT THERE ARE NO CIRCUSES BASED IN CALIFORNIA THAT USE ANIMALS BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP THE ARE THE STATE I'LL FITS WITH THE EXPENSE OF RAPSHEETS. FROM COMING HERE AND ENDANGERING THE PUBLIC CAN IMBUE ABUSING ANIMALS. THE GARDEN BROTHERS CIRCUS IS KNOWN AS THE WORST CIRCUS INAMERICA AND IS PERFORMING TEN DAY AND ANNIE ARE CALIFORNIA TOMORROW IN SANTA ROSA.

A FEW YEARS AGO ZEBRAS ESCAPE FROM THE UNIVERSAL CIRCUS IN OAKLAND A ZEBRA CAM BREAK A LION'S DRAW YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT COULD DO TO A HUMAN. POLLING SHOWS THAT THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT BANNING ANIMALS IN CIRCUSES THIS GROWING PUBLIC DISDAIN IS FOR ARCHAIC ANIMAL CIRCUSES AND INCIDENTS LIKE THE ONES I JUST DISCUSSED ARE WHY SO MANY JURISDICTIONS.

SUBJECT ONLY A CERTAIN SECTOR OF OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS A CERTAIN DISCLOSURES SO IF YOU ARE SAY -- FRACKING IN AN OIL FIELD UNDER AN OLD BILL WE PASS AS BEFORE YOU STILL HAVE TO DISCLOSE THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS. OF THAT FRACKING FLUID YOU'RE INJECTING BUT UNDER CURRENT LAW -- THOSE ASSESSMENTS -- ARE ARE NOT. ARE NOT NOTICED IN THE SAME -- THE SAME MANNER -- AS AS IT IS. FOR NATURAL GAS STORAGE SO WE'RE SEEKING IMPROVE THE ASSESSMENT THE RISK TO PUBLIC HEALTH FROM GAS STORAGE WELL LEAKS IN THE FUTURE LIKE THE ONE WE HAD IN. MY DISTRICT IN A LEASE SO CANYON ABOUT REQUIRING MORE THOROUGH DISCLOSURE SO IN THE EVENT OF A LEAK ENHANCE REPORTING MONITORING. ARE ALSO REQUIRED SO WHEN IMPLEMENTED IDEALLY A MORE COMPLETE PUBLIC HEALTH ASSESSMENT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. WHAT WE LEARNED FROM LEE SO CANYON IS THAT IT WASN'T JUST GAS THAT? CAME OUT OF THAT FEEL DURING THE EXPLOSION BUT IN FACT THERE WAS OIL IN VARIOUS HEAVY METALS BARIUM. BENZENE THAT HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE SICK AND THEY SIMPLY DON'T KNOW WHY SO IF YOU MADE SICK BY ONE OF THESE INCIDENTS THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO KNOW. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING YOUR DOCTOR WHAT ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE MADE ME SICK OPEN IS SIMPLE DISCLOSURE MEASURE -- BRINGS SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS MYSTERY THAT'S BEEN AFFECTING OUR COMMUNITY FOR YEARS AND HOPEFULLY I WON'T AFFECT OTHER COMMITTEES IN THE FUTURE BUT THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SAFETY BACKSTOPS SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

FOR OKAY -- SEARCH FOR YOUR PRESENT. WELL -- WE ARE ON NUMBER. THREE THIS IS THE ONE THIRTY FOUR ONE OF HI. HI SO -- LAST YEAR [inaudible] FROM. AUGUST TO JUNE. MY STAFF TOGETHER WITH. DENNIS O'CONNOR HERE THIS STAFF. WE'RE INVOLVED IN A EXPAND A A PROTRACTED NEGOTIATION. TO TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE AS CONSERVATION IS A WAY OF LIFE. CONVENING AS MANY AS I THINK SEVENTY PEOPLE AT TIMES IN THE ROOM TRYING TO COME UP WITH AN AGREEMENT TO DEAL WITH CONSERVATION IS YOU KNOW. A COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE GOVERNOR HAD AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ASK FOR CERTAIN LEVELS OF CONSERVATION WAS PRETTY SUCCESSFUL. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WAS IN THE LARGER ARCHITECTURE OF WATER POLICY TO BE ABLE. TO DEAL WITH THE OTHER ISSUES CERTAINLY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE QUALITY OF DRINKING WATER A REMAINING ISSUE IS PART OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH. BUT THIS HAD TO DO WITH CONSERVATION. AND SO ON AND THAT WAS A YOU A TWO BILLS SIX OH SIX WHICH WAS OUR BILL IN THE SENATE. AND THE ASSEMBLY BILL I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBERS HERE BUT IT HAD TO DO WAS A SUMMER FRIEDMAN TO THEY WERE PART OF THE PACKAGE AT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED. AND I'M OUR SOLUTION THAT WAS TO COME UP WITH AN INDIVIDUAL AS WATER USE OBJECTIVE DETERMINING BY THE SUM OF MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MEANS THAT WATER SUPPLIERS WERE TO FIND SAVINGS ACROSS THE RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL. WATER LOSS AND OUTDOOR USE A ONE OF THE GREAT CRITICISMS THAT WITH AFTER THIS THING CAME ABOUT GROUPS ARE SAYING -- I CAN'T FLUSH MY TOILET AND TAKE A SHOWER AT THE SAME TIME AND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT WAS WATER LOSS ACROSS THE THE AGENCY SO AND AND CONSERVATION ACROSS THE AGES IT WASN'T APPLIED TO THE INDIVIDUAL. BUT APPLY TRYING AS AN AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE CONSERVING WATER IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS APPROACH. AND SO -- IT LOUD WATER AGENCIES TO MEET THEIR STANDARDS THAT ACCUMULATED APPROACH A WOMAN ACCUSED THIS MEASURE. TO UPHOLD THE SPIRIT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS FROM LAST YEAR TO ENSURE THAT WATER SUPPLIERS ARE GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY THEY NEED -- TO PRACTICALLY REACH THEIR EFFICIENCY GOALS IN THAT REGARD SPECIFICALLY THIS MEASURE. DETERMINES THAT THIS -- THE TERMS OF STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WILL ENFORCE AND ACCUMULATED PERFORMANCE STANDARD. ENSURING THAT THE VOLUME AT VOLUME OF WATER LOSS IS NOT ENFORCED SEPARATELY FROM OTHER FACTORS NOW THERE IS. A OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS ALWAYS BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN BY THIS COMMITTEE STAFF. WHICH IDENTIFIES A A A A A ATTENTION THAT EXIST WHERE THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE ROOM AND WHAT THEY MEANT. AND SO WE LOOK AT SOME OPTIONS OF BY YOUR COMMITTEE -- WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT HERE BUT I WANT THE REST OF THE BILL TO BE PRESENTED SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOR YOU FOR THE FOLLOW UP. ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF YOU KNOW WATER CONSERVATION IS A WAY OF LIFE AND HOW DO WE MEET THOSE STANDARDS TO OFTEN ARE QUITE TICKLISH IN THE PROCESS. THANK YOU CENTER RIGHT NOW MY NAME IS DANIEL BLOSSOM HIDING WITH THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION ARE FORTY PLUS MEMBERS SERVE ABOUT 70% OF THE WATER. IN CALIFORNIA I'M SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HERTZBERG DID A GREAT JOB EXPLAINING THE INTENT OF THE MEASURE BUT WE REALLY FEEL SO THIS APPROACH -- ALLOWS WATER SUPPLIERS OF FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE ON ON WHAT AREAS ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON BASED ON WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. LEVERS THE PUSH AND PULL IF YOU WILL -- WE BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE COMPONENTS WATER LOSS IS BEING HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD AND IT IS CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF THE LEGISLATION AGREE TO LAST YEAR. AS A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SB FIVE FIVE FIVE DIRECTED YOU TO BE YOU ARE IN THE STATE FOR TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE VOLUME OF WATER LOSS. WHEN THE STATE BOARD ADOPTS THE REGULATIONS THE VOLUMETRIC STANDARD WILL BE ENFORCEABLE THE STANDALONE TARGET? AND THIS IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER -- PART OF THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE AND COULD SUBJECT WATER SUPPLIERS TO SIMULTANEOUS ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. I DON'T WANT TO BE CLEAR WATER AGENCIES ARE COMMITTED TO MEETING THE OBJECTIVES OUTLINED IN THE LEGISLATION FROM LAST YEAR THAT WE WERE PROUD TO SUPPORT. AND WE WANT TO ACTIVELY REDUCE WATER LAWCENTER SYSTEMS IT MAKES OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL SENSE TO DO SO -- WE BELIEVE THAT WATER LOSS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN THE OBJECTIVE BUT IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO HOLD THAT ELEMENT TO A HIGHER STANDARD. THAN EVERY OTHER ELEMENT NOR IS IT APPROPRIATE TO START YOU KNOW IN FORCING OR ENSURING THAT -- WATER SUPPLIER NEEDS EACH INDIVIDUAL PART OF THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE -- WE BELIEVE THAT ONE THIRTY FOUR IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE COMPLIMENTS THE EFFORTS OF WATER SUPPLIERS BY PROVIDING CLARITY THAT THE VOLUMETRIC WATER LOSS PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. ARE ONLY ENFORCEABLE PART OF THE OVERALL AND WATER USE OBJECTIVE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE THOSE VERY GOOD THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISS CHAIR MEMBERS ADAM KIANA SOME BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- LAST YEAR AKA WORKED WITH THE SENATOR CMU A AND AND MANY OTHERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SB. SIX OH SIX AS PART OF THAT PROCESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AQUA ADVOCATE FOR HIS FLEXIBILITY FOR OUR WATER AGENCIES. IN MEETING THIS NEW URBAN WATER USE OBJECTIVE -- I AM GONNA GIVE ME MUCH OF THE COMMENTS THAT I MADE DANIELLE COVER MOST OF IT -- REALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS -- THESE OBJECTIVES TOTAL THE WAY THEY WERE CONSTRUCTED WAS REALLY IN THE AGGREGATE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF WAYS TO MEET THESE CONSERVATION STANDARD AND FOR US MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS THAT FLEXIBILITY FOR EACH AGENCY TO DECIDE HOW. TO MEET THOSE CONSERVATION STANDARDS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US. EACH AGENCY IS VERY DIFFERENT WE REPRESENT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PLUS WATER AGENCIES -- AND SO THE WAY TO GO ABOUT MEETING THIS OBJECTIVE IS IS CAN BE VERY DIFFERENT ACROSS THE BOARD. IF I COULD JUST DRAW A QUICK COMPARISON -- TO THE R. P. S. PROGRAM IT WAS ESTABLISHED OBVIOUSLY BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO YOUR PS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS AND PROMOTE THE USE OF RENEWABLES. SIMILARLY THE KIND CONSERVATION BILLS PASSED LAST YEAR SEEK TO REDUCE WATER USE AND PROMOTE CONSERVATION. THERE ARE FEARS PROGRAM PROVIDES A VARIETY OF OPTIONS FOR UTILITIES TO PROCURE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND REDUCE THEIR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS IT DOESN'T SET A STANDARD FOR EACH TYPE OF ALSO FEEL. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE WE'RE SETTING A CONSERVATION STANDARD AND MAKING SURE THAT EACH AGENCY HAS THE ABILITY TO MEET THAT STANDARD IN A VARIETY OF WAYS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US. SO -- BY BY PRIORITIZING WATER LOSS OVER. OTHER WAYS TO MEET THAT STANDARD INDOOR OUTDOOR EFFICIENCIES. AND YOU'RE TAKING AWAY THAT FLEXIBILITY SO WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR IS TO MAINTAIN THAT FLEXIBILITY THAT WE UNDERSTOOD WAS A PART OF THE LAW -- AND AND SO WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SIR OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THERE'S DIVERSE I'M HEALTHY MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT OF ORANGE CALIFORNIA. UP OR MODOC MODOC BECAUSE ONE OF THE FIRST WATER INDUSTRIES -- AGENCIES TO GO UP IN SUPPORT OF SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT SIX OF SIX WAS EXTREMELY CONTROVERSIAL THE WAY WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE COMFORTABLE WITH IT WAS SAYING. YEAH THIS IS A BIG CHANGE BUT YOU WON'T BE MICROMANAGE IT'LL BE UP TO YOU TO HOW TO MEET THIS IF WITH A TOLD THEM AT THAT TIME THAT WE'RE GONNA PULL SOMETHING OUT IN YOUR SOMETHING NOT INCLUDED WHEN A MICRO MANAGE ON THAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN. THEM OVER THE HUMP ON THIS NO WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN CONVERSATIONS WHERE I WAS TOLD THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED IN QUORUM COOK CLEAN UP LEGISLATION. OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW THAT CLEAN UP IS POSTING ON CONTROVERSIAL SO WE THANK SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR BRINGING THIS PART THANK YOU. ISN'T IT FUN TO NEGOTIATE THE BIG DEALS WITH HIS CONFUSION AT THE END. THAT'S WHAT I SAID. REINER JACKING OF REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE DEAL THE DEAL THE DEAL. AND WITH THAT SUPPORT. GOOD THANK YOU. NO I MAC ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF ROSEVILLE NIVAL ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THE ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. AND MR BEFORE YOU CALL FOR OPPOSITION IF I COULD JUST BRIEFLY BUCK YOU KNOW WORK WE'LL WE'LL WORK IT OUT WE'RE GONNA WILLING THE THE THE THE YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF. WHO IS PART OF THIS THING FOR THOSE TEN MONTHS -- WHEN HE WORKED FOR MY COMMITTEES DEFINITE JUST YOU KNOW WE STILL YOU KNOW HOW THAT WORKS A FEW WE STILL ALL PART OF THE STATE YOU GOT IT WE'RE ALL PART OF THE SAME FAMILY YEAR? BUT WHAT WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT I MEAN HE'S OUTLINED THREE OPTIONS AND LOOK IT'S NOT EASY BUT IT WE GOT WAY DOWN THE ROAD IN SOMETHING WHERE NOBODY EVER THOUGHT WE DID WITH WATER CONSERVATION AND THESE ARE CHALLENGING AND IF DIFFICULT THINGS BUT I HAVE TALKED TO ENERGY SEE. AND THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY REASONABLE IN THIS STUFF AND SO JUST TO YOU KNOW YOU ARE BE I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I SAID I WOULD DO IN THE BEGINNING AND YOUR HONOR BOUND TO FOLLOW THROUGH. RIGHT YES YES HONOR IS EVERYTHING FOR THE INSTITUTION BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S A PATHWAY FORWARD WITH THE GUIDANCE OF YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF -- WELL SAID. OTHERS IN SUPPORT NO. WE HAVE SOME OPPOSITION. YEAH THAT THAT'S RESERVE THAT. AND SO YEAH YOU WANT TO COME ON UP THOSE IN OPPOSITION. WE JUST YES I HAVE A BRIEF DISCUSSION. I'LL BE READY FOR IT. HI AND WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON OF MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TRACY CLAN I AM DE CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR OF WATER. EFFICIENCY FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. I RESPECTFULLY TAKING THE POSITION OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. ENERGY SEE WAS ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE SUPPORTERS OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WATER EFFICIENCY LEGISLATION AND WORKED CLOSELY WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AND THE STAKEHOLDERS -- WHERE THE ISSUE OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY DID COME UP DURING THAT DEBATE? ABOUT WE NEVER DISCUSSED REMOVING ENFORCEMENT FROM THE WATER LOSS STATUE THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ADOPTE UNDER -- SB FIVE FIVE FIVE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IF THAT HAD BEEN PROPOSED I WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR SUPPORT FOR THAT LEGISLATION. ENERGY SEE IS SYMPATHETIC TO THE POTENTIAL DOUBLE DOUBLE JEOPARDY ISSUE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SOLUTION. BUT RESPECTFULLY AND VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE THE APPROACH TAKEN IN -- THE CURRENTLY WRITTEN SB. ONE THIRTY FOUR WATER LOSS IS ONE OF THE CLEAREST FORMS OF WATER WASTE. IT'S WATER THAT IS A STRETCH EXTRACTED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT SOMETIMES PUMP HUNDREDS OF MILES TREATED TO DRINKING WATER STANDARDS AND THEN LOST THROUGH LEAKS AND PIPE BREAKS. OCCASIONALLY CAUSING EXTENSIVE AND EXPENSIVE DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. RESPONSIBILITY TO MEET A WATER LOSS STANDARD IS ALSO COMPLETELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE WATER UTILITY IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS. IT'S UP TO THEM TO GO OUT AND AND MEET THAT STANDARD AND AND FIX THOSE LEAKS -- I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT MEMBER WHY WATER LOSS WAS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE WATER EFFICIENCY OBJECTIVE. PRIOR TO THE LEGISLATIVE PERIOD -- WE ALL WORKED THERESTAKEHOLDER PROCESS WITH FIVE STATE AGENCIES TO DEVELOP THE MAKING WATER CONSERVATION A CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE FRAMEWORK. AND AT THAT TIME THIS OBJECTIVE WAS ENVISIONED TO INCLUDE ALL TYPES OF WATER DEMANDS -- SO WATER DEMANDS PLUS WATER LOSS EQUALS THE WATER THAT UTILITIES PUTTING IN THE SYSTEM. WHICH MADE THE FOR COMPLIANCE PURPOSES A WATER SUPPLIER COULD SIMPLY REPORT THE WATER THEY'RE PUTTING INTO THE SYSTEM IT WOULD REALLY JUST MAKE THE ACCOUNTING IMPORTING A LOT EASIER. AS IT BECAME LEGISLATION AND WE WORK TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SOME OF THOSE DEMANDS WERE STARTED STARTED TO BE PULLED FROM THE WATER OBJECTIVE SO COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL INDOOR WATER USE WS PULLED OUT. IT MAKES A LOT LESS SENSE FOR THAT WATER LOSS TO BE IN THERE NOW SO AGAIN WATER LOSS WAS NOT INCLUDED TO PROVIDE EXTRA FLEXIBILITY IT WAS INCLUDED TO EASE REPORTING. NOW IT DOES IF YOU WE DO SUPPORT IF YOU ARE EXCEEDING YOUR WATER LOSS STANDARD BEING ABLE -- TO USE THAT TO HELP ME YOUR OBJECTIVE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S CAPTURED UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE NUMBER TWO THAT YOU SEE IN THE ANALYSIS -- THERE'S ALSO -- ANOTHER OPTION THEIR ALTERNATIVE THREE BOTH OF THOSE REMOVED DOUBLE JEOPARDY WITHOUT REMOVING THE ENFORCEMENT FROM THE WATER LOST OUT YOU. WE MET WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG THIS MORNING AND HE HAS AGREED TO WORK WITH US TO HOPEFULLY SETTLE ON AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH THAT WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. WE APPRECIATE THE SENATORS COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH US -- AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION AND LESS IT IS AMENDED TO ADDRESS DOUBLE JEOPARDY WITHOUT REMOVING ENFORCEMENT THE WATER LAW STATUTE FOR THE WATER LOSS AT WATER LOSS STANDARDS FOR THE WATER LAST ISSUED BY THE STATE BOARD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN HIS WITH. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. BRENNAN DAWSON WAS ERICA CALIFORNIA WE WOULD ALIGN OURSELVES IN OUR DC OF WE DIDN'T GET A LETTER AND WE'RE SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT NOW YOU HAVE IT. THANK YOU. OKAY I KNOW THERE'S IN OPPOSITION. COMMENTS QUESTIONS I DO A YOUR QUESTION COMING YOU SIR AND ALWAYS OF JUST GENERALLY A COMMENT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN MADE AWARE OF A COMPANY THAT NOW THAT IT'S PROVIDING. LEAGUE THE TEN DETECTION TECHNOLOGY [inaudible] MANAGED. PRETTY AFFORDABLE IN IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THROUGH -- THROUGH -- DETECTION SYSTEM THAT. NOTES -- CHANGES OF PRESSURE AND OPINION WHERE THEY APPLY THEIR TECHNOLOGY COULD HELP. MUNICIPALITIES IDENTIFY WHERE LEAKS ARE KIND OF IN REAL TIME. AND AS WE GET THIS TECHNOLOGY -- DEVELOPED IT WOULD BE NICE. TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO EMPLOY IT AND WHEN I WHEN I A I HELPED -- MANAGE THE WITH THE WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM IN SAN DIEGO THE TRUTH THIS -- A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE RELATED. TO OTHER LOSSES WERE FACING CASA -- FORCES TO PUT A CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT INTO UPGRADING OUR SYSTEM AND WE WENT FROM. A LEAK EVERY WEEK TO TO LIBERAL ZERO LEAKS PER YEAR -- BUT I LITERALLY ENORMOUS GAINS JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'RE TIRED OF LOSING LAWSUIT AND AND WHAT AND BEEN FINE. AND INSTEAD OF A COMPLAIN THAT MONEY TO PAY LAWSUITS AND FINDS WHEN WE JUST FIX OUR YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT THE END OF THE PIPE IN SAN DIEGO SO WE HAVE LIMITED OPTIONS OF WHERE TO GET OUR WATER SUPPLY FROM BUT ALSO IF WE DO GET IT WE CAN'T. LINK IT NO MATTER WHERE IT COMES FROM AT THE END OF THE PIPE DOWN THE S. AS THOUGH I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO INA. WHAT TO WORK ON THIS AND TO ALSO LOOK AT WHAT OPTIONS THERE ARE TO PUT INTO? OF YOU KNOW A MAYBE IT MAYBE WE GIVE. CREDIT TO AGENCIES THAT OF STARTED EFFORT TO REDUCE THESE LEAKS AND IF THEY'RE PLAYING THESE TECHNOLOGIES SOMEHOW ADDED TO THE BILL. YOU KNOW WE WE WE HAVE LESS EXCUSES TODAY THAN WE DID TEN YEARS AGO. A QUESTION -- SO AT SOME POINT IS GONNA BE A A BALANCE IN TERMS OF HOW WE ADDRESS THE STATEWIDE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR THE CENTER I'M SO COMMENTS FROM THE AUTHOR IN TERMS OF OPTION TWO I KNOW WAS BROUGHT UP BY OUR DC YEAH IT WOULD TAKE WE TALKED THIS MORNING ABOUT OPTION TWO OPTION THREE I I WHAT I WANT TO TO HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK TO THE SPONSORS. OF THE BILL AND KIND OF GO BACK AND TRY TO GET SOME STE BACK AND FORTH AND MAYBE BORROW YOUR IF WATER CONSULTANT AGAIN IF I COULD. TO HELP US I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO HELP US KIND OF REACH A RESOLUTION I MEAN LOOK WE THIS IS HARD AND I I THINK WHICH IN A WAY SO SAYS CORRECT TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO CHANGE IS GONNA BE NEW WAYS TO LINE. PIPES IS GONNA THE COST OF WAR A WOMAN WATER SO GREAT -- YOU KNOW FOR A BUNCH OF REASONS AND WE JUST GOT TO BE SMARTER ABOUT IT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WERE WAY DOWN THE ROAD COMPARED TO WHAT WE USED TO BE. AND WE GOT A REPAIR THIS AND THEN WE GET A FOCUS ON WATER QUALITY FOR THE MILLION PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT DON'T HAVE CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. BUT THIS NOTION OF OF NOT UNDER CUTTING SB WHAT IS IT FIVE FIVE FIVE THE WOKE BILL THE WOKE BILL WHO. JUST INTENT NOT TO UNDER CUT THAT AND SORT OF TRY TO STICK WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEAL. YEAH I MEAN IT'S HARD TO SUBMIT A HARD DEBTS WHY TOOK TEN MONTHS WITH THESE GUYS AS SMART AS THEY ARE MAKE IN THIS DEAL HE COULD DO IT IN TEN WEEKS THEY TOOK TEN MONTHS. AT ALL THE MEETINGS AND STUFF YOU KNOW THE WATER WORLD'S LIKE IT'S HARD AND AND SO I'M PRETTY PROUD OF HOW FAR WE CAN DOWN THE ROAD I THINK A SIMILAR FRIEDMAN DID A GREAT JOB AS WELL -- YOU KNOW OUR TEAM WAS IT WAS JUST I THINK PRETTY PHENOMENAL AND YOU KNOW IT SHOOTS THE PRICE OF MOVING DOWN THE ROAD SO WHAT WOULD LOOK THE BOTTOM LINE IS WORKING TO TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT. AND WE WILL. WE WILL RIGHT. ARE WE APPRECIATE THAT COMMITMENT AND AND GOOD POLICY MAKING IS HARD I DO FOR THE RECORD I DO THINK THERE'S SOME. IS THERE SOME CLEVERNESS IN THIS NOTION OF LOOKING AT WHETHER YOU'RE EXCEEDING THE WATER USE SUBJECTIVE SOLELY BECAUSE YOU'RE SIXTY THE WATER LOSS STANDARD IN SORT OF A WAY. TO ED PARSE OUT THE CAUSATION BEHIND IT -- TO TRY TO GET IT. STRIKE CONTINUE THE GOOD ACCOUNTING BUT NOT HAVE SOME ARBITRARY DOUBLE JEOPARDY SO I HOPE YOU ALL CONSIDER THAT AS WELL GOING FORWARD WOULD LOVE YOU TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND I'M. A VERY TO MOVE THE BILL LONG TODAY WITH THAT COMMITMENT SENATOR SO. OKAY -- NO OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS LATER CLOSER. AS FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK IS GOING OKAY.
