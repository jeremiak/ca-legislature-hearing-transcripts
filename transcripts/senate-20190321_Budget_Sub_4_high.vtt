LIKE --

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.326
SORRY --

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:15.895
THEY GET LIKE FIVE AMERICORPS

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:17.430
FEDERAL AT LEAST A FEDERAL

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:19.465
LIAISON TO GET ACCESS TO FEDERAL

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:20.733
PROGRAMS.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.769
VERY IS A PREFERENCE POINTS AS

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:25.304
FOR FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND FUNDING

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.205
AND SO IT'S SORT OF A

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:28.541
COORDINATED WAY TO HELP BOOST UP

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.443
COMMUNITIES BUT FROM A MUCH

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:31.878
LARGER SCALE.

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:32.778
SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:34.213
BUT THEY'RE SORT OF AIMED AT THE

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.982
SAME THING BRINGING UP AND

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:37.917
HELPING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:40.152
LOWER INCOME ARE A BLIGHTED OR

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:41.420
DISTRESSED.

00:08:41.487 --> 00:08:44.123
SO HOW DO YOU SEE THEM WORKING

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.093
TOGETHER OR THE COORDINATED OR

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:49.662
WHAT WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP.

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.697
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT'S CREATED

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:55.935
BY HAVING BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:57.069
I THINK THE ESPECIALLY IF.

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:57.770
THERE MUST BE SOME AREAS THAT

00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:58.804
OVERLAP THAT ARE BOTH

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:02.575
OPPORTUNITIES OWN AND AMAZON AND

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:03.643
THEN THERE'S AREAS THAT ONLY

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:07.813
HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER CORRECT SO.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.215
MAYBE YOU CAN SEE.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.483
EXPLAIN THAT.

00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:12.351
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION --

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:15.154
I'M NOT I'M NOT ABLE TO DISCERN

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.423
WHY THE LEGISLATION WAS WRITTEN

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.191
AS IT WAS I CERTAINLY THINK

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:22.328
THERE'S A CONNECTION OPPORTUNITY

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.930
FOR COMMUNITIES TO WORK TOGETHER

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:25.998
I THINK WHERE THERE ARE PROMISE

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.433
ZONES AND WHERE THEY'RE POP

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.234
PROMISE ON THAT OP AND

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.369
COMMUNITIES ARE ALREADY WORKING.

HERE THERE MIGHT BE A MORE

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:45.952
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SET UP

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:47.887
BASE IN THIS AREA BUT OF COURSE

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:49.488
THERE'S A KIND OF ACTIVITY

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:50.656
AROUND THE STATE --

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:52.792
VARIOUS COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.662
HIGH SPEED RAIL AND THE CENTRAL

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:58.197
VALLEY --

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.032
DOES THE STATION AREAS ARE AREAS

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:02.535
WHERE INVESTORS MIGHT LOOK AT SO

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:04.770
THEY ARE NOT RELATED BUT HEY

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:06.939
ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AS THE LAW

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:10.109
GEOGRAPHICALLY TARGETED ECONOMIC

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.777
DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OF WHICH

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:14.213
THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL SO AND

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.116
DO BOTH HAVE THESE TAX DEFERRALS

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:19.418

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:25.124
OKAY.

OPPORTUNITY ZONES.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.801
ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:38.404
HOW IT MIGHT FURTHER INCENTIVIZE

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:39.839
GENTRIFICATION.

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:41.841
DO YOU HAVE ANY [inaudible]

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.342

GET A RESPONSE TO THAT.

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:52.184
SITE I CERTAINLY THINK THAT --

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:54.086
THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:56.022

AND HOW THEY MIGHT BE MITIGATED

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.132
AND WE THINK THAT THE WAY TO

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:07.767
MITIGATE A LOT OF THOSE ISSUES

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:10.002
IS TRUTH THROUGH LOCAL PLANNING.

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:13.639
AND THAT IS PART OF OUR INTO TO

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:15.374
MAKE SURE THAT LOCALS HAVE

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:16.509

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.210
IN HOW THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:21.013
THESE PROGRAMS AND SO UP LOCAL

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.015
PLANNING LAWS ARE GOING TO MAKE

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:24.750
A HUGE DIFFERENCE [inaudible]

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:27.086
PREVENT GENTRIFICATION BUT OF

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:28.954

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:36.662
SO THOSE MAY CHANGE AND AND THIS

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:38.864

00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:06.798
DESCRIPTION TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:07.299
ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:08.867
THIS PROGRAM WORKS.

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.769
SO CALIFORNIA WROTE LAW REQUIRES

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:11.770
BUSINESSES LIKE THINGS ARE

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:14.206
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO REPORT

00:21:14.272 --> 00:21:15.140
ANNUALLY TO THE STATE JEWELERS

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:16.141

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:21.480
ABOUT PROPERTY THAT'S CONSIDERED

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:24.583
A BAND THEN BY OWNERS.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.517
GENERALLY IN THIS CASE MEANS

00:21:25.584 --> 00:21:29.187
CASH SO LIKE ON CASH CHECKS OR

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:32.991
GARMENT BAG --

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:34.660
TAKE TEMPORARY TITLE IN THIS

00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:37.462
PROPERTY IF NEITHER THE BUSINESS

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:39.031
NOR THE STATE IS ABLE TO REUNITE

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:40.365
THE PERSON WITH THEIR PROPERTY.

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:41.099
AND THEN MAINTAIN AN INDEFINITE

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:46.104
LIABILITY TO ONE THEY REUNITE.

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:47.773
WITH THEIR PROPERTY.

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:49.307
WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH --

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:50.375
THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IS

00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:54.346
PROPOSAL SAID WE WOULD KNOW THAT

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:55.414
THE AUDIT.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.348
THEIR PROPOSE WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:56.982
YOU KNOW A COUPLE DOZEN A YEAR

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:59.584
OR NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MATCH

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.186
THE VAST UNDER COMPLIANCE RATE

00:22:01.253 --> 00:22:02.120
IN THIS AREA RIGHT.

00:22:02.187 --> 00:22:03.555
SO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:07.926
CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ARE LIKELY

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.695
NOT COMPLYING WITH THAT STOCK.

00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:11.096
SO TO THAT END WE RELEASED A

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:12.931
REPORT LAST WEEK LOOKING INTO

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:16.201
JUST A BIGGER PICTURE

00:22:16.268 --> 00:22:16.501
[inaudible]

00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:18.270
INCREASED COMPLIANCE.

00:22:18.336 --> 00:22:19.371
A LOT.

00:22:19.438 --> 00:22:20.439
WE HAVE --

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:21.039
BUT FORGET THERE.

00:22:21.106 --> 00:22:22.474
ARE THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY TWO

00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:24.342
REASONS THAT BUSINESSES TEND TO

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:25.043
BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.279
THE FIRST IS THE BUSINESSES ARE

00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:28.380
SIMPLY UNAWARE OF THE LAW.

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:29.314
AND THEN THE SECOND IS THAT

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:30.282
BUSINESSES SOMETIMES ARE

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:32.684
WILLFULLY NON COMPLIANT BECAUSE

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:33.218
THERE'S A RELATIVELY HIGH

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:35.120
INTEREST PENALTY ASSOCIATED WITH

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.488
A FAILURE TO COMPLY.

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:38.857
IT'S 12% PER YEAR FOR PASSED YOU

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:40.726
PROPERTY SO IF BUSINESSES HAVE

00:22:40.792 --> 00:22:42.194
PROPERTY THIS DECADES OLD

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.662
THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO

00:22:43.729 --> 00:22:45.630
WANT TO REPORT AND GO TO THIS

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:47.032
AND WE HAVE.

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:48.166
TO THE SUGGESTIONS THAT THE

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:50.001
LEGISLATURE CREDIT DOCTOR TO

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:51.069
MORE BROADLY ADDRESS THIS

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:52.504
PROBLEM OF NON COMPLIANCE.

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:54.673
THE FIRST ONE TO ADDRESS THE

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.875
PROBLEM OF ON AWARENESS A LOT

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:59.311
WOULD BE TO HAVE BUSINESSES

00:22:59.377 --> 00:22:59.911
REPORT.

00:22:59.978 --> 00:23:07.786
ANNUALLY FOR TAX FILING STAFF TV

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:10.355
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE ANY TAX.

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:12.557
PLEASE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE

00:23:12.624 --> 00:23:14.159
BUSINESSES AWARENESS OF A LOT

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:16.161
THE SECOND OUT APPROACH WOULD BE

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.296
TO PROVIDE A TEMPORARY AMNESTY

00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:20.465
PERIOD FOR HIS FOR BUSINESSES

00:23:20.532 --> 00:23:21.533
THAT COME FORWARD AND

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.768
VOLUNTARILY.

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:25.170
ESSENTIALLY TO WAVE AT 12%

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.873
ANNUAL I DON'T SEE FOR THE

00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:28.640
PROPERTY.

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:31.009
THIS WOULD ON BOTH YOU KNOW

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:32.144
PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.545
BUSINESSES TO COME FORTH AND IN

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:40.752
THE FOURTH.

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:43.021
AND THEN ALSO PREVENT ANYTHING.

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:44.623
ANYTHING FUND DO FINANCIAL

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:47.626
BURDEN IS ASSOCIATED WITH COMING

00:23:47.692 --> 00:23:48.760
INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW

00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:49.060
[inaudible]

00:23:49.127 --> 00:23:50.662
I'M JUST

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:51.763
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY LEGISLATURE

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.898
COULD TAKE EITHER OF THESE

00:23:52.964 --> 00:23:53.865
ACTIONS TOGETHER I'M SORRY

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:54.733
INDIVIDUALLY BUT THEY WOULD BE

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.901
MOST EFFECTIVE IF THEY WERE

00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:56.468
TAKEN TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:57.135
WOULD.

00:23:57.202 --> 00:23:58.470
ADDRESS BOTH THE PROBLEM ON

00:23:58.537 --> 00:24:00.405
AWARENESS OF LAW AND ALSO OF

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:01.139
WILLFUL NON COMPLIANCE.

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:02.240
I'M CLEARLY THE PRIMARY REASON

00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:03.275
FOR ADOPTING THIS WOULD BE TO

00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:04.376
REUNITE MORE MONEY MORE MONEY

00:24:04.442 --> 00:24:06.178
WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHTFULLY

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:06.545
BELONGS.

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:07.479
TO BUT I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT

00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:08.780
THERE WOULD BE SOME GENERAL FUND

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:09.347
BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:10.515
BECAUSE MONEY THAT IS NOT

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:11.383
REUNITED ITH --

00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:13.151
WITH ITS RIGHTFUL OWNERS IS --

00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:14.152
DOES PROVIDE A GENERAL FUND

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:18.557
REVENUE SOURCES SO THAT COULD BE

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:19.157
IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

00:24:19.224 --> 00:24:22.694
DOLLARS.

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:25.263
JUST A QUESTION ON THAT.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.401
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF OF BY

00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:31.069
DOING BY IMPLEMENTING BOTH OF

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.437
THOSE --

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:34.039
BOTH OF THOSE IDEAS.

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:37.609
THE RESOURCES THAT IT WOULD TAKE.

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:38.310
AND WHAT IT.

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:39.477
YOU KNOW WHAT IT REALLY BALANCE

00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:43.181
OUT WILL WITH IT --

00:24:43.248 --> 00:24:46.284
SO -- I

00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:47.519
CAN'T ANSWER SORT OF

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:48.887
SPECIFICALLY.

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:50.455
BECAUSE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:51.656
EFFECTIVE BOTH OF THESE MARIN

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:53.391
CITY BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:55.060
CONTEXT SO.

00:24:55.126 --> 00:24:56.728
THE STATE DID ADOPTED TEMPORARY

00:24:56.795 --> 00:24:58.363
AMNESTY VERY ONCE IN THE PAST --

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.831
IT WAS IN THE EARLY ON THIS

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:04.269
PROGRAM SKEWS FOR I THINK.

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.238
AND THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AT

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:06.771
THE TIME ESTIMATED THAT IT

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:08.139
BROUGHT IN ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL

00:25:08.206 --> 00:25:08.740
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:10.709
SO THAT WAS JUST JUST ON THE ON

00:25:10.775 --> 00:25:14.246
THE AMNESTY PERIOD NOT ALSO --

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:15.680
DOING THIS MECHANISM OF HAVING

00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:16.948
THIS REPORT TO FTP SO IT

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:18.250
PROBABLY BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:20.385
IF IT WAS COUPLE TOGETHER --

00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:21.953
IT WOULD REQUIRE SOME IN BOTH OF

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.256
THESE OPTIONS WOULD REQUIRE SOME

00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:26.558
RESOURCES BOTH FOR F. T. V. TO

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:27.125
YOU KNOW --

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:28.460
ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE TO

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:30.262
BUSINESSES AND WORK WITH THIS IS

00:25:30.328 --> 00:25:31.663
IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS AND

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.798
ALSO FOR SCO --

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:37.369
TO RESPOND TO INCREASE CLAIMS TO

00:25:37.435 --> 00:25:39.571
PROCESS MORE ON AS IT COMES IN

00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:41.239
BUT IT'S VERY VERY LIKELY THAT

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:47.012
THE GENERAL FUND BENEFIT WOULD

00:25:47.078 --> 00:25:50.081
FAR EXCEED.

00:25:50.148 --> 00:25:51.783
YOU HAVE ANY.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.717
SPONSORED COMMONSENSE YEAH SO

00:25:52.784 --> 00:25:53.385
FOR THE FIRST ITEM REGARDING THE

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:54.986
BUSINESS TAX FORMS ON THE FACE

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:55.987
WE AGREE I'M THAT THIS SOUNDS

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:56.821
LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:58.023
IT CERTAINLY COULDN'T HURT ON

00:25:58.089 --> 00:25:59.557
THE COMPLIANCE RATE AND WILL

00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:02.294
PROBABLY INCREASE AT IT WOULD BE

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.795
A GOOD COMPANION TO OUR CURRENT

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:07.198
OUTRAGE IN COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:08.199
HOWEVER WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A

00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:09.534
WAY TO REJECT THE IMPROVED

00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:11.403
COMPLIANCE OF THIS YOU KNOW WHAT

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:12.771
THIS WOULD I WITH THIS CHANGE

00:26:12.837 --> 00:26:14.105
WOULD MAKE --

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:15.974
AND THAT BEING SAID THE PROPOSAL

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.542
WOULD IMPACT LIKE BILLY --

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:19.110
SENT -- ARE

00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:22.847
THE OF TO BE AND HARD TO TIONAL.

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:25.317
RESOURCES FOR BOTH OF US --

00:26:25.383 --> 00:26:26.584
IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:28.353
LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE --

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.421
TO PURSUE THE S. YOU COULD%

00:26:29.487 --> 00:26:31.356
CONSULT WITH A TV IN THE COMING

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:32.958
MONTHS AND REPORT BACK AND MAYBE

00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:34.526
IN THE FALL --

00:26:34.592 --> 00:26:36.094
WHICH WOULD BE WHICH TO COINCIDE

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:40.899
WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:41.232
BUDGET CYCLE.

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:42.300
GREAT.

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:44.102
FINANCE DEPART FINANCE.

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:44.970
AND THE PROPOSAL ON THE

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:46.071
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUPPORTS THE

00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:47.339
CONTROLLERS ONGOING EFFORTS

00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:48.406
TOWARDS ADDRESSING --

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:50.375
HOLDER COMPLIANCE AND WE HAVE NO

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:52.010
POSITION ON THE LA US

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:55.613
RECOMMENDATION AT THIS TIME.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.382
SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.

00:26:57.449 --> 00:27:00.151
RESPONSE TO THOSE.

00:27:00.218 --> 00:27:00.752
WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENT

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:04.823
THIS TIME --

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:09.928
OKAY.

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:12.330
THE COMPLIANCE RATE HAS BEEN

00:27:12.397 --> 00:27:17.035
VERY LOW. 2% 2% YEAH SO 98%.

00:27:17.102 --> 00:27:20.505
OF BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYERS.

00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:21.973
THERE ARE HOLDING [inaudible]

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.842
MONEY.

00:27:23.908 --> 00:27:24.476
RIGHT.

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:26.244
ARE NOT REPORTING IT ARE THEY

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:29.581
NOT REPORTING IT OR THEY'RE NOT --

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:31.082
MAKING EFFORTS.

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:32.884
TO TURN IT OVER TO THE STATE OR

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:36.654
TO THE INDIVIDUAL.

00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:38.523
SO MY NAME IS GERRY CLOSER THAN

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:39.657
THE DIVISION CHIEF OF THE

00:27:39.724 --> 00:27:40.959
UNCLAIMED PROPERTY PROGRAM AND

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:42.427
REGARDING THAT --

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:44.162
WE BELIEVE THAT --

00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:46.097
AS AS MISTER HOLLAND SAID IN

00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:47.198
INDICATED DALY OF THAT SOME HOLD

00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:48.600
HOLDER SIMPLY AREN'T AWARE OF

00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:50.201
THE LAW AND THE REQUIREMENT.

00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:51.903
AND THE EQUALLY --

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.905
SOME HOLDERS ARE VERY WELL AWARE

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:56.508
OF IT AND ARE NOT INTERESTED IN

00:27:56.574 --> 00:28:01.046
FILING IN COMPLYING --

00:28:01.112 --> 00:28:04.249
THE 98% ARE --

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:06.484
BASED ON THE TOTAL BUSINESSES IN

00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:08.286
CALIFORNIA THE REPORTING TO THE

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:09.654
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND WE WOULD

00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:11.022
SUBTRACT OUT OF THAT.

00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:12.590
HOLDERS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE SELF

00:28:12.657 --> 00:28:13.992
EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS ARE VERY

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:15.727
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE LIKELY

00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:17.328
NOT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT

00:28:17.395 --> 00:28:17.695
SO.

00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:20.532
THE 98% AS A POTENTIAL SPECTRUM

00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:22.100
OF HOLDERS THAT WOULD NEED THAT

00:28:22.167 --> 00:28:23.101
ATTEMPTS LEE COULD BE HOLDEN

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:25.136
PROPERTY BUT WE OFTEN DON'T KNOW

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:26.071
AT THIS POINT TIME.

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:28.440
I HAVE HEARD FROM CONSULTANTS

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:29.074
AND REPRESENTS THE HOLDERS THAT

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.609
THEY YOU KNOW ARE NOT REALLY

00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:33.044
WILLING TO REPORT TO CALIFORNIA

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:35.747
BECAUSE OF A 12% INTEREST RATE --

00:28:35.814 --> 00:28:37.549
BUT THERE'SHIGHER PENALTIES AND

00:28:37.615 --> 00:28:39.584
OTHER PROGRAMS WITH TAXES SO

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:40.819
THAT'S I WOULD LOOK AT IT AS

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:42.787
SOMEONE NOMINAL PENALTY FOR NON

00:28:42.854 --> 00:28:45.390
COMPLIANCE ESPECIALLY THIS

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:47.125
WILLFUL NONCOMPLIANCE.

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:48.693
SO DO YOU GO IF WHEN WE DID THIS

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.495
BEFORE THE AMNESTY.

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:52.397
WE DID THIS YEAH I HAVE I WASN'T

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:53.832
HERE THE TIME HAVE SOME GENERAL

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:54.699
BACKGROUND --

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:55.467
I THINK THAT WAS --

00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:58.103
IN 200-020-0012 THOUSAND TWO WAS

00:28:58.169 --> 00:28:59.104
INTENDED TO BE A ONE YEAR

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.638
PROGRAM WAS EXTENDED TO TWO

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:01.306
YEARS.

00:29:01.372 --> 00:29:02.507
AND THE NET THAT ARE BROUGHT IN

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:04.209
WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY SIX

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:06.177
MILLION DOLLARS --

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:07.879
THE PROCEEDS --

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:10.048
SO SO WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:11.783
INCREASE COMPLIANCE WITH IT GO

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:15.153
UP BY. 2% OR TWENTY OUT WE

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.989
HAVEN'T --

00:29:18.056 --> 00:29:19.157
SOMETIMES WHEN THERE'S A MC

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:20.558
PROGRAMS --

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.127
HOLDERS WILL IF THEY DON'T

00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:23.528
PARTICIPATE THEN IT ACTUALLY

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.096
CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:26.865
THEY'RE NOT AS INTERESTED IN.

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:28.566
COMPLYING AND WAITED FOR THE

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:29.968
NEXT ONE INTENTIONALLY SO --

00:29:30.034 --> 00:29:30.768
BUT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE

00:29:30.835 --> 00:29:32.604
REALLY PREMATURE FOR US TO WORK

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.506
WE WOULD BE WILLING TO LOOK INTO

00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:37.008
THIS IN THE COMING YEAR TO AS AS

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:38.476
JENNIFER SAID.

00:29:38.543 --> 00:29:39.377
TO GET BACK TO ANY OTHER THINGS

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:40.078
ON THEM.

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:42.747
YEAH AND I LIKE TO SAY THAT --

00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:43.414
YOU KNOW THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT

00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:45.150
THE AN AMNESTY PROGRAM WOULD

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:47.986
GENERATE IMPROVED COMPLIANCE --

00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:49.220
BUT WE FEEL THAT IT WOULD BE A

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:51.356
ONE TIME COMPLIANCE --

00:29:51.422 --> 00:29:55.026
AND BASED ON OUR PAST EXPERIENCE --

00:29:55.093 --> 00:29:56.561
AND SO THAT'S WHY THE SCO HAS

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:58.630
INSTEAD FOCUSED ON AND ITS

00:29:58.696 --> 00:29:59.430
OUTREACH --

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:01.032
AND THE AUDIT PRESENCE WITHIN

00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:04.235
THE HOLDERS --

00:30:04.302 --> 00:30:07.639
TO ENSURE THAT WE AT LEAST CAN --

00:30:07.705 --> 00:30:09.974
TO ALEX.

00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:12.977
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

00:30:13.044 --> 00:30:13.278
[inaudible]

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:15.246
WILK.

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:16.314
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:17.515
MORE HERE THOUGH THAT WE'RE EVER

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:19.484
GOING TO ATTAIN MUCH IMPROVEMENT

00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:21.452
AND COMPLIANCE --

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:22.987
YOU'RE BASING IT SIMPLY ON

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:26.157
BETTER INFORMATION BUT IF

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:27.825
THEY'RE STILL ALIVE.

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:29.727
THE RELUCTANCE BECAUSE THE 12%

00:30:29.794 --> 00:30:30.361
RATE.

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:32.096
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET ILLICIT

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:33.331
ANYMORE --

00:30:33.398 --> 00:30:34.799
COMPLIANCE.

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:36.701
IF THE IF THAT'S A PUNITIVE RATE

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.036
THEY'RE NOT GONNA WANNA REPORT

00:30:38.102 --> 00:30:39.537
AND WHAT WHAT WILL CHANGE JUST

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:41.105
THAT THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S A

00:30:41.172 --> 00:30:42.674
PENALTY.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:43.942
THEY DON'T KNOW NOW SEEMS LIKE

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:45.076
THEY MUST OR THEY WOULD NOT BE

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:49.914
APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE 12% RATE.

00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:50.481
WELL I THINK.

00:30:50.548 --> 00:30:51.115
THE THREE PART APPROACH ABOUT

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.151
REACHING COMPLIANCE OF EDUCATION

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:54.619
TO THE HOLDERS THAT WE DO IN OR

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:55.787
OUT REACHING CLIENTS IN ALONG

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:56.788
WITH A LOT IT'S WHICH THIS

00:30:56.854 --> 00:31:00.625
REQUEST IS FOR TO CONTINUE THAT.

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.227
TO TO TO EDUCATE THE HOLDERS.

00:31:02.293 --> 00:31:03.995
OF PARTICIPATION ARE SOME VIABLE

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:05.163
THINGS THERE'S ALSO

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.031
OPPORTUNITIES FOR REQUEST FOR

00:31:07.098 --> 00:31:08.132
INTEREST.

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.702
AND WAIVERS FOR REASONABLE

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:13.404
BECAUSE KIND OF BUSINESS COULD

00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:15.173
FEDERATION I BELIEVE WITHIN A

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.674
ABOUT THAT THAT THAT THAT COULD

00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:18.076
HELP YES.

00:31:18.142 --> 00:31:19.577
AND I BELIEVE IN THE LAST YEAR

00:31:19.644 --> 00:31:20.945
SO JUST A BALLPARK I DON'T HAVE

00:31:21.012 --> 00:31:22.480
NUMBERS FOR ME BUT HUNDREDS OF

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:23.681
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INTEREST

00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:25.250
AND WAVED BECAUSE A REASONABLE

00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:27.485
CAUSE REQUESTS A FRENCH LEAKS

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:28.119
OUT SOMETHING THAT SAYS THAT

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:30.154
ALREADY EXIST YES THAT PRESENT

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:31.656
REALLY EXHAUSTION STATUTE SO

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:31.889
THAT IS.

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:33.558
PART OF THIS I MEAN IT'S PART OF

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:34.993
WHAT ALREADY.

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:39.597
IS AVAILABLE ABSOLUTELY YES.

00:31:39.664 --> 00:31:40.932
I WOULD ONLY SUGGEST MADAM CHAIR

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:42.066
THAT WE HAVE A AN ACCURATE

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:43.434
REPORTING OF OF WHAT NUMBERS OF

00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:45.336
CONTACTS IN.

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:47.939
THE RETURNS THAT TO THE THEY GOT

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:49.574
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WILLING TO

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:50.875
THEN COME FORTH WITH.

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:52.410
A COMPLIANCE COME INTO

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:55.013
COMPLIANCE AND GET THAT OF OF OF

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:56.714
2% OF THE KEEP LINGERING IT TO

00:31:56.781 --> 00:32:01.252
THE FOR FOR A LOT OF YEARS IT'S

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:02.420
NOT NOT WORTH IT WORTH THE

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:04.389
EFFORT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME.

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:05.123
SO WE NEED TO TRACK IT IN OTHER

00:32:05.189 --> 00:32:06.324
WORDS MAYBE IT'S SMALL BUT A

00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:07.792
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:09.294
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.763
YOU HAVE TO CLICK JESS'S.

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:15.400

GOOD.

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:32.283
I JUST WANT TO REMIND US ALL

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.153

THIS IS MONEY.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.423
THIS IS MONEY THAT IS BEING HELD

00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:41.059
THE DOES NOT BELONG. TO THE

00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:43.461

THAT MONEY OVER.

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:05.717
AND THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT.

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:07.385
JUST AS A LOGICAL TO PAY.

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:09.620
THIS CHEQUE WAS NOT CACHED FOR

00:33:09.687 --> 00:33:10.655

ALRIGHT BUT BEFORE WE GET BACK

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:34.445
TO THE LEFT THINK ABOUT SOME

SO WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:35:30.127 --> 00:35:32.230
THE DELAY IN PAYMENT SHOULD BE

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:34.665
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PENALTIES

OKAY -- I'M

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:49.046
QUESTION.

00:35:49.113 --> 00:35:50.882
THE CONTROLLER I RECENTLY

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:54.218
RECENTLY SAID A SENT A LETTER --

00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:56.487
EXPRESSING CONCERNS REGARDING

00:35:56.554 --> 00:36:01.726
FISCAL IMPLEMENTATION.

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.895
SO HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO THE

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:07.598
CONCERNS.

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:08.633
GOOD MORNING SENATORS MY NAME'S

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:09.867
GEORGE LOIS I'M THE CHIEF

00:36:09.934 --> 00:36:11.602
OPERATING OFFICER AT THE

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:13.638
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE.

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:15.206
THE CONTROLLERS LETTER.

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:17.275
WAS BASICALLY JUST TO RAISE

00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:18.609
AWARENESS --

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:20.411
AS WITH ANY LARGE COMPLEX I KEEP

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:22.813
PROJECT ISSUES COME UP WHEN

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.181
FUNCTIONALITY IS IMPLEMENTED.

00:36:24.248 --> 00:36:26.117
AND THESE ISSUES REQUIRE SOME

00:36:26.183 --> 00:36:27.852
TYPE OF STABILIZATION WORK TO

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:29.921
OCCUR IN ORDER TO CORRECT THEM.

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:31.556
AND ALL THE CONTROLLER IS AYING

00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:32.957
HERE IS THAT THE SHE FULLY

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:34.525
SUPPORTS THE PROJECT.

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:36.294
BUT ONCE STABILIZATION EFFORTS

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.361
TO TAKE PRIORITY OVER THE

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:39.030
SCHEDULE --

00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:41.299
IN ORDER TO GET A DIFFERENT

00:36:41.365 --> 00:36:43.868
PROJECT DOES THAT NOT

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:45.436
PRIORITIZING STABILIZATION

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:47.638
CREATES RISK.

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:48.906
AND RISKS WOULD BE.

00:36:48.973 --> 00:36:50.241
THE POSSIBILITY OF INACCURATE

00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:51.642
REPORTING.

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:52.777
AND THE LATE PRODUCTION OF

00:36:52.843 --> 00:36:54.679
AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:55.713
HENCE THAT'S WHY SHE SENT A

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.614
LETTER SHE JUST WANTS MORE

00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:58.115
AWARENESS OUT THERE THAT SHE

00:36:58.182 --> 00:36:59.083
EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS VERY

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.318
SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROJECT SHE

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:01.719
WANTS THE PROJECT.

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:04.088
TO FOCUS ON STABILIZING EFFORTS.

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.623
VERSES THE SCHEDULE NOT HAVING

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:06.457
TO SCHEDULE BE THE MOST

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:07.792
IMPORTANT THING BUT STABILIZING

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:09.860
THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT'S ALREADY

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:11.295
BEEN IMPLEMENTED.

00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:12.430
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN STABILIZE

00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:14.432
IN AS FAR AS THE CONTROLLERS

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:15.833
CONCERN SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.668
ISSUES WITH THE SALUTE

00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:19.704
FUNCTIONALITY THAT WAS RELEASED

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:20.438
IN OCTOBER WHICH INCLUDES A

00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:22.106
LARGE A GOOD PART OF THE

00:37:22.173 --> 00:37:25.343
CONTROLLERS CONTROL FUNCTIONS --

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:27.378
THERE ARE INTERFACES THAT --

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:29.380
INTERFACE DATA TRANSACTION DATA

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:31.382
BETWEEN OUR LEGACY SYSTEM AND

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:32.049
FOR SCALE.

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:33.517
WHEN IT WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:34.819
THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH THE

00:37:34.885 --> 00:37:36.020
INTERFACES?

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:37.254
AND THAT CAUSED A LOT OF

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:38.689
TRANSACTIONS TO BE STUCK IN

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:39.957
SUSPENSE.

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:40.891
AND THE DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:43.160
STRUGGLING TO GET THOSE ITEMS

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:44.996
OUT OF SUSPENSE SO.

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:46.430
WHERE WERE SAYING THAT WHEN WE

00:37:46.497 --> 00:37:47.965
NEED TO HELP THESE DEPARTMENTS

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:48.899
FIGURE THAT OUT AND GET THIS

00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:50.768
DONE SO THAT THE INFORMATION CAN

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:52.403
FLOW INTO OUR LEGACY SYSTEM

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.838
BECAUSE OUR LEGACY SYSTEM?

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:55.272
IS STILL THE BOOK A RECORD IT

00:37:55.339 --> 00:37:56.474
HAS TO GET INTO OUR LEGACY

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.975
SYSTEM FOR US TO DO THE

00:37:58.042 --> 00:37:58.943
REPORTING ACCURATELY.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.579
US THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE IS A LOT

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:04.949
OF STRUGGLING THERE ARE TRAINING

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:06.484
ISSUES THAT I THINK EVERYBODY'S

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.019
AWARE OF THE DEPARTMENTS NEED

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:09.487
SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:11.222
ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST EVEN OUR

00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:11.922
STAFF NEED SOME ADDITIONAL

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:13.290
TRAINING --

00:38:13.357 --> 00:38:16.093
SO THAT IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.261
AND THEN --

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:18.663
PART RELATED TO THAT IS A

00:38:18.729 --> 00:38:20.131
DEPARTMENTS ALSO NEED TRAINING

00:38:20.197 --> 00:38:21.699
AND ALSO KNOWING AND FIGURING

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:23.000
OUT HOW TO CLOSE THEIR BOOKS

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:24.335
EVERY MONTH AND CLOSE THEIR

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:25.569
BOOKS AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:26.771
SO THEY COULD PROVIDE US WITH

00:38:26.837 --> 00:38:28.139
THE FINANCIAL DATA WE NED TO

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:29.774
PUBLISH THE NOT ONLY THE

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.175
BUDGETARY LEGAL REPORT BUT ALSO

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:32.610
A COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:34.545
REPORT.

00:38:34.612 --> 00:38:35.146
WHICH IS AUDITED BY THE STATE

00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:35.946
HONOR.

00:38:36.013 --> 00:38:36.914
AND WE FEEL THAT THOSE ARE TWO

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:38.215
THINGS THAT REALLY ARE CRITICAL

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:40.351
THAT WE NEED TO TO TO STABILIZE

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:41.585
THE SYSTEM.

00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:44.588
AND AND THE TRAINING AT THE

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:45.189
DEPARTMENT SO WE CAN GET THAT

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:45.923
DONE.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.957
UP BECAUSE HAVING LATE

00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:48.592
PRODUCTION OF AUDITED FINANCIAL

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:49.627
STATEMENTS.

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:51.262
CONSISTENTLY WILL RAISE SOME

00:38:51.328 --> 00:38:53.631
QUESTIONS AND IN WITH THE

00:38:53.698 --> 00:38:54.231
INVESTOR COMMUNITY WE WANT TO

00:38:54.298 --> 00:38:56.767
AVOID THAT.

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:58.169
SO -- DO YOU

00:38:58.235 --> 00:38:59.904
THINK THE FISCAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.839
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THE

00:39:01.906 --> 00:39:04.408
DELAYS. TO DATE THE RESULT IN

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:06.143
PENALTIES I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.978
HAD ANY PENALTIES WE HAD HAD

00:39:08.045 --> 00:39:09.914
SOME SYSTEM ISSUES ONCE AGAIN

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.514
WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:13.584
FUNCTIONALITY BACK IN DECEMBER --

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:15.920
THAT CAUSED A LOT OF VOUCHERS

00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:17.455
THAT WHICH ARE THE CLAIMS THAT.

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:20.591
CREATE THE PAYMENT. TO GET STOCK

00:39:20.658 --> 00:39:21.992
WE COULD HAVEPOTENTIALLY HAD

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:23.994
SOME PENALTIES BUT STAFF WORKED

00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:25.329
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OVERTIME

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:26.864
BOTH AT THE DEPARTMENTS AT FIRST

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:28.733
GALLON THAT SCO. TO CLEAN UP

00:39:28.799 --> 00:39:30.367
THAT PROCESS BUT THAT MADE US

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:31.402
REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THERE

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:33.437
ARE POTENTIAL POSSIBILITIES HERE.

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:34.972
THAT WE COULD HAVE LATE PAYMENTS

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.173
BECAUSE OF NOT ONLY THE

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.375
DEPARTMENTS ARE JUST AS THE BUT

00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:39.376
ALSO POTENTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE

00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:40.211
SYSTEM.

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:41.979
THE ONE ISSUE IN DECEMBER EVEN

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:43.781
THOUGH IT WAS HUGE WE DID.

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:45.282
I BELIEVE WE AVERTED THE

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:46.984
POSSIBILITY OF PAYMENTS OF PET

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:49.153
OF PENALTIES I HAVEN'T HEARD OF

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:49.653
ANY PENALTIES.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.921
COMING OUT OF THAT BUT THERE WAS

00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:54.859
THE POTENTIAL [inaudible]

00:39:54.925 --> 00:39:55.226
OKAY [inaudible]

00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:57.394
COLLEAGUES.

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:59.029
AT LAST HEARING I ASKED WHAT THE

00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:01.332
STATE OF STABILIZATION WAS WITH

00:40:01.398 --> 00:40:02.666
RESPECT TO THE VARIOUS UNITS.

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:05.002
ANY REPORT WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:07.738
STATE OF STABILIZATION HOW MANY

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:08.839
UNITS ARE STABILIZED.

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:10.841
I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION

00:40:10.908 --> 00:40:12.943
BUT I KNOW THAT THE THAT THE

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:14.278
FISCAL PROJECT IS WORKING

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:16.147
DILIGENTLY TO CREATE A NEW

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:17.681
SCHEDULE AND SOME AFFECT WE'RE

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:18.282
MEETING WITH THEM.

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:19.817
TOMORROW TO DISCUSS THE NEW

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:21.318
SCHEDULE AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:22.720
AND WHAT STABILIZATION ACTUALLY

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:24.321
LOOKS LIKE --

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:25.956
FOR BOTH US AND THE DEPARTMENTS

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:27.124
I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:28.526
YET BUT HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:29.693
THE DAY TOMORROW HAVE A LITTLE

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.961
BIT MORE INFORMATION OKAY.

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:32.296
AN IN HOUSE STABILIZATION IS

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:33.497
DEFINED BOTH THE STATUS

00:40:33.564 --> 00:40:35.733
STABILIZATION AND HOW IT'S THE

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:41.972
FOREIGN VIENEN TRYS TO MAKE OKAY

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:42.273
[inaudible]

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:44.809
YES PLEASE.

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:46.277
YOU PUT A LOT OF WEIGHT ON

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:47.845
TRAINING WHAT.

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:49.780
VISIONS AS CONTROLLERS OFFICE

00:40:49.847 --> 00:40:52.716
MADE TO ENHANCE YOUR CURRENT

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:54.919
TRAINING.

00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:57.388
THAT'S NOT DISCUSSED HERE SO

00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:58.622
WHAT WHAT'S THE PLAN TO IMPROVE

00:40:58.689 --> 00:40:59.757
TRAINING SUCH TRAINING IT IS TWO

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:00.324
FOLD THE CONTROLLERS OFF OUR

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:00.925
TRAINING FOR OUR STAFF IS OUR

00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:02.293
RESPONSIBILITY THE TRAINING FOR

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:05.362
DEPARTMENT STAFF IS NOT OUR

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:07.765
RESPONSIBILITY AND OUR STAFF

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:08.766
HAVE NEEDED ADDITIONAL TRAINING

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:09.200
IN.

00:41:09.266 --> 00:41:11.468
UTILIZING FIRST GAL BECAUSE IT'S

00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:14.004
IT'S A NEW SYSTEM FOR THEM --

00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:14.805
BUT I BELIEVE DEPARTMENTS ALSO

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:16.607
NEED ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND

00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:18.342
UTILIZING FISCAL OUT AND I THINK

00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:19.577
THE DEPARTMENTS.

00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:23.981
THAT DEAL WITH THE SYSTEM THE

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:24.949
SOME DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

00:41:25.015 --> 00:41:26.517
I NEED SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:28.118
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM.

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.086
IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:31.255
THEY'RE USED TO WORKING WORKING

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:33.290
ON CAL STARS WHICH MOST

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.792
DEPARTMENTS WERE --

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:36.694
SOMEBODY WORKING ON CAL STARS

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.328
FOR TWENTY YEARS AND NOW YOU'RE

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:38.963
YOU'RE TELLING THEM THEY HAVE TO

00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:40.965
USE A PEOPLESOFT PRODUCT WHICH

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:42.266
IS WHAT VIZQUEL IS.

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.667
OUR THERE'S A THERE'S A PROBABLY

00:41:43.734 --> 00:41:45.369
A HUGE GAP IN KNOWLEDGE AND HOW

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:46.937
TO GET FROM CAL STARS TO PEOPLE

00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:48.105
SO OFTEN THEY NEED QUITE A BIT

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.373
OF TRAINING. TO TAKE WELL

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.908
TOGETHER THAT SAID WHAT HOW ARE

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:52.676
WE GOING ABOUT DOING THIS IS

00:41:52.743 --> 00:41:53.577
SOMEONE ASSIGNED THE

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:55.813
RESPONSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING THE

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.781
TRAINING REGIMEN AND SCHEDULING

00:41:57.848 --> 00:42:00.150
THE TRAININGS AND THEN.

00:42:00.217 --> 00:42:02.119
YOU HAVE STAFF THAT ARE NOW

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.087
DOING TRAINING AND THEY'RE NOT

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:05.322
DOING THEIR NORMAL JOB HOW ARE

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:07.124
WE COVERING THEIR WORKLOAD AND

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.559
THEIR COST AND AND AND ALL THE

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:12.496
WORDS IN THERE HAS GOT TO BE A

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:14.365
TRAINING.

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:15.165
PROTOCOL OR OF A TRAINING

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:16.867
PROGRAM DO YOU HAVE THOSE ARE

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:18.736
THEY BEING USED AT ALL NOW OR IS

00:42:18.802 --> 00:42:19.270
THIS SOMETHING BRAND NEW.

00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:20.537
I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO

00:42:20.604 --> 00:42:21.872
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANSWER

00:42:21.939 --> 00:42:23.540
THAT QUESTION IT'S NOT SOMETHING

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:25.276
THAT SCO IS INVOLVED TO IN AS

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:25.876
FAR AS TRAINING FOR THE

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:27.912
DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW TO FINANCE.

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:30.681
IT OF HOW THIS IS GOING IT IT

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:32.082
SEEMS SO VERY NEBULOUS.

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:33.817
WE HAVE A PROBLEM THAT I'M NOT

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:35.252
GETTING UNDER TO HANDLE ON HOW

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:38.722
WE ARE DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM.

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:40.824
I'M SINCE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED IN

00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:41.892
TWENTY FOURTEEN DEPARTMENT HAVE

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:43.594
A FINANCE HAS.

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:44.862
A DEVELOPED --

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:47.598
TRAINING FOR YEAR END STATEMENTS

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:50.200
ON HOW TO PRODUCE THOSE FROM

THEY'RE LITERALLY BRICK AND

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:03.547
MORTAR --

00:53:03.613 --> 00:53:06.383
BUSINESS SAYS THAT THE ALLIES

PAYMENT FOR THE LOAN.

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:32.242
AND THAT WAS INTENDED --

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:34.945
TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THIS

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:37.614
SMALL LOANS.

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.182
I CAN ONLY ASSUME AYE YEAH BUT

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:41.585
THAT WAS THE IDEA BEHIND IT

00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:43.019
CRACKED BECAUSE HE FELT THAT

00:53:43.086 --> 00:53:45.855
WHAT JUST THE LARGER LOANS WERE

00:53:45.922 --> 00:53:46.890
BEING GIVEN OUT BUT NOT SMALLER

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:47.090
LOAN.

00:53:47.157 --> 00:53:50.727
SO UNDER THE CFL LOT UNDER.

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:52.662
TWENTY FIVE LOANS UNDER TWENTY

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:53.296
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ARE HIGHLY

00:53:53.363 --> 00:53:55.198
REGULATED AND THE INTEREST RATES

00:53:55.265 --> 00:53:56.566
ARE -- I

00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:58.168
BELIEVE --

00:53:58.234 --> 00:54:01.805
30% WHERE AT I AM --

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:04.474
THE INTEREST RATE IS HIGHER --

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:07.310
AND JUST RECENTLY WE'VE EXPANDED

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:10.013
THE ACTUAL LOAN AMOUNT TO BE

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:10.547
SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED WITH

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:11.982
CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

00:54:12.048 --> 00:54:14.117
AND UP TO SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:16.686
WHAT'S THE INTEREST RATE.

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:19.522
IF IT'S AND IT'S A IT'S A SPLIT

00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:20.457
RATE.

00:54:20.523 --> 00:54:21.558
AND SO IT'S A VERY BILL LOAN

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:22.292
RATE.

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:24.227
SO STARTING WITH THE LESSER OF

00:54:24.294 --> 00:54:27.597
36% OR THIRTY TWO POINT 75% PLUS

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:30.533
THE PRIME RATE OF THE FOR FOR

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.901
THE FIRST THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:34.170
IT'S IT'S VERY DETAILED IN THE

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:35.605
AND STATURE.

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:38.842
AS FAR AS WHAT THE LOAN RATE IS

00:54:38.908 --> 00:54:40.043
SO IT IT IS NOT IF YOU'RE GOING

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.278
FROM TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO

00:54:42.345 --> 00:54:42.779
SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED THE

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:48.051
INTEREST RATE GOES DOWN OR UP

AND PEOPLE.

00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:56.493
UNDER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IT'S

00:54:56.559 --> 00:55:00.997
SO WAS A CAP OF THIRTY SIX I

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:01.698
IT'S A SPLIT RATE IT'S A

00:55:01.765 --> 00:55:03.333
VARIABLE RATE EXISTENCE IT'S A

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.768
LOT MORE --

00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:06.670
IT'S DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN UNLESS

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:08.405
I GO THROUGH THE ACTUAL STATUE

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:09.906
AND GO THROUGH EVERYTHING.

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:12.876
OKAY --

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.544
COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS.

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:17.113
NO [inaudible]

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.449
THE NUMBER --

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:19.983
THE QUESTION ABOUT THE THE

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:20.950
FINDERS --

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:22.318
DIDN'T DO THE ACTUAL LICENSEES

00:55:22.385 --> 00:55:23.687
IN THE FINDERS TO THE SPLIT

00:55:23.753 --> 00:55:24.554
COMMISSIONS THEY SPLIT THE

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:25.822
INDUSTRY HOW THE FINDERS

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:27.157
COMPENSATED THERE ARE

00:55:27.223 --> 00:55:30.060
ADMINISTRATION FEES TO SO AND

00:55:30.126 --> 00:55:33.697
THERE IT'S A NINETY DOLLAR --

00:55:33.763 --> 00:55:35.165
IT'S NINETY DOLLARS FOR THE

00:55:35.231 --> 00:55:38.835
MINISTRATIONS BE. OH SORRY.

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:40.270
THAT WAS FOR THE CUSTOMERS HE

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:42.205
WANTED TO KNOW.

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:42.772
WHAT IT WAS FOR THE PLANE?

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:44.607
SO IT ACTUALLY JUST INCREASED SO

00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:46.643
THE FINDERS CAPPED AT SIXTY FIVE

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:47.711
DOLLARS PER LOAN PLUS TWO

00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:50.513
DOLLARS PER PAYMENT RECEIVED BY

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.981
THE FINDER.

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:53.783
THAT'S WHAT THE PILOT LENDER

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:56.319
PAYS THE FINDER.

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:57.987
IT IS IS THERE A PENALTY --

00:55:58.054 --> 00:56:00.223
IS WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS ARE

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:01.925
THE FINDERS --

00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:05.495
INCENTIVIZE BEYOND THE STATUTORY

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:06.896
RATES.

00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:10.700
AND IF THEY ARE INCENTIVIZE

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:11.835
MISSION.

00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:14.437
IS A PENALTY.

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:16.172
THAT MAKES NO IT'S AUTHORIZED

00:56:16.239 --> 00:56:17.774
FOR THEM TO HAVE THIS RIGHT NO

00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:19.943
SO SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THE

00:56:20.009 --> 00:56:23.713
LENDER SAYS. TO A FINDER I WILL.

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.715

ALSO GIVE YOU. 10% OF ANY LOAN.

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:34.924
IF SO.

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:35.859
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S NOT

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:37.794
AUTHORIZED THE FIRST QUESTION IS

00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:39.629
IS THAT AUTHORIZED I THINK YOUR

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.264
ANSWER IS NO THE SECOND IS IF

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:42.465
THERE'S A VIOLATION OF THE

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:44.334
FINDER IS ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.836
BEYOND THE STATUTORY FEES.

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:48.571
IS THERE A PENALTY I SUPPOSE THE

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:49.939
THIRD QUESTION IS OKAY THERE IS

00:56:50.006 --> 00:56:51.775
A PENALTY WHAT IS THAT PENALTY

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:54.911
SO AND THE THE ISSUE WOULD BE

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:56.679
WITH A PILOT PROGRAM LENDER AND

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.948
SO WE WILL HAVE TO REFER THEM TO

00:56:59.015 --> 00:56:59.916
ENFORCEMENT IF WE DO SEE

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:01.451
SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE AND IF.

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:02.452
THEY DO NOT CORRECTED THROUGH

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:03.720
THE REGULATORY PRACTICE SO

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:05.355
DEPEND IS DEPENDING ON HOW

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:07.490
