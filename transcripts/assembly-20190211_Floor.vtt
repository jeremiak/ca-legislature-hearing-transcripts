ITSELF BEGAN IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:56.039
ABOUT A HALF A CENTURY AFTER THE

AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:15.124
BECAUSE BECAUSE OF A LACK OF

THEREFORE IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX

00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:25.168

TOOK PLACE.

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:30.206
FEBRUARY WAS CHOSEN IT

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:31.507
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AS THE

00:58:31.574 --> 00:58:34.210
SHORTEST MONTH OF THE YEAR.

00:58:34.277 --> 00:58:35.578
BUT WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE OF THE

SIGNIFICANCE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

00:58:38.448 --> 00:58:41.517
AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS. TWO

00:58:41.584 --> 00:58:42.318
INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY BELIEVED

00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:44.087
HAD A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN

00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:44.988
CHANGING THE PROJECT THREE OF

00:58:45.054 --> 00:58:46.990
THE LIFE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:48.224
THIS COUNTRY.

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.993
OVER THE YEARS BLACK HISTORY

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:51.828
MONTH HAS CONTINUED TO GROW AND

00:58:51.895 --> 00:58:52.829
TO DEVELOP BLACK HISTORY WEEK I

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:54.330
SHOULD SAY.

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:56.833
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL NINETEEN

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:57.600
SEVENTY SIX THAT WE BEGIN TO

00:58:57.667 --> 00:58:58.935
TALK ABOUT BLACK HISTORY MONTH

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:00.303
MORE THAN JUST THE SECOND WEEK

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:01.404
OF FEBRUARY.

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:04.440
BUT THE ENTIRE MONTH OF FEBRUARY.

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:07.477
AND OF COURSE IN THIS HOUSE IN

00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:09.545
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AB TWENTY

00:59:09.612 --> 00:59:10.713
SIX EIGHTY FOUR AYE BY EIGHTY

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:11.347
FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILLIE

00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:11.581
BROWN.

00:59:11.648 --> 00:59:13.182
SIGNED INTO THE GOVERNOR'S

00:59:13.249 --> 00:59:14.450
PROCLAMATION REGARDING MARTIN

LUTHER KING'S BIRTHDAY.

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:17.253
ONCE AGAIN GIVING CALIFORNIA

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.988
MORE THAN ONE DAY TO CELEBRATE

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:20.757
AND RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.759
OF AFRICAN AMERICANS.

00:59:22.825 --> 00:59:24.427
IT HAS BEEN ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:27.030
YEARS WHO WILL BE IN AUGUST.

00:59:27.096 --> 00:59:27.964
THAT THE FIRST AFRICANS CAME TO

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:31.234
THIS COUNTRY.

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:33.903
THEY LISTED THEM AS TWENTY AN

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:35.538
ODD NEGROES.

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:37.240
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN.

00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:38.274
TWENTY THEY WERE INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:40.243
HAD BEEN CAPTURED ON A SHIP.

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.078
BY THE DUTCH.

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:43.246
AN EVENTUALLY SOLD AND TRADED

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:45.648
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:46.549
THEY WERE.

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:48.952
THE FIRST TO COME.

00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:51.120
AND THEY WERE LISTED AND SOLD AS

00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:53.222
INVOLUNTARY LABORERS AND

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:55.158
INDENTURED SERVANTS.

00:59:55.224 --> 00:59:56.693
THIS WAS NOT THE BEGINNING OF

00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:58.861
SLAVERY AS MOST PEOPLE THINK.

00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.930
BECAUSE SHORTLY AFTER THAT TIME

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:02.365
THEY HAD CONTRACTS TO SAID THAT

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.334
THEY WOULD WORK. FOR A SPECIFIED

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.535
PERIOD OF TIME.

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:06.569
AND THEN THEY WOULD GAIN THEIR

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:08.037
FREEDOM JUST LIKE ALL OTHER

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:10.540
INDENTURED SERVANTS DID.

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:12.041
AND IT IT WITHIN THREE OR FOUR

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.076
YEARS SOME OF THEM WERE LISTED

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:14.644
AS LAND OWNERS.

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:15.912
SO IT'S INCORRECT TO BELIEVE

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:16.913
THAT THE FIRSTPERSON WHO CAME

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.414
HERE WERE SLAVES.

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:19.449
THEY WERE NOT THERE WHEN

01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:20.850
INDENTURED SERVANTS LIKE SO MANY

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:22.618
OTHERS.

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:23.386
THEY CAME HERE YEAR BEFORE THE

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.221
MAYFLOWER.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.457
WHICH WAS IN.

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:28.424
SIXTEEN TWENTY SO YEAR BEFORE

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:29.826
THE MAYFLOWER AFRICANS WILL ON

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.094
THIS CONTINENT.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.696
WORKING TO DEVELOP AMERICA AND

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:36.432
TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION.

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:37.433
EVENTUALLY THE SLAVE TRADE DID

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.569
DEVELOP.

01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:40.870
AND IT BECAME THE WORST SYSTEM

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:43.139
ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:44.774
SLAVERY HAD ALWAYS EXISTED IN

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.776
AMERICA IT ALWAYS EXISTED AROUND

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:47.777
THE WORLD.

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.078
BUT THE KIND OF SLAVERY THAT

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:52.115
EXIST IN AMERICA WAS UNKNOWN TO

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.783
ANY HUMAN KIND.

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.418
IT WAS NOT JUST AS SLAVERY FOR

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.086
LABOR TEMPORARILY IT WAS THE

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.088
SLAVERY OF THE SOUL.

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:00.123
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO NOT ONLY

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.624
IMPRISONED THEMSELVES BUT FOR

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:02.859
GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS TO

01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:04.460
COME.

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:06.396
EVENTUALLY EVERY LAW WAS WRITTEN

01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:08.264
TO PUT TO PREVENT THEM FROM

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.766
HAVING ANY RIGHTS IN THIS

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:10.633
COUNTRY.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.502
AND TO IT AND AND OFTENTIMES TO

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.170
LEGALIZE THE BRUTAL BRUTALITY

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.338
THAT EXISTED.

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:17.006
AND OF COURSE THE OWNERSHIP OF

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:18.408
INDIVIDUAL SO THAT THEY CAN

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:20.343
ACTUALLY BE SOLD THE COULD BE

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:21.344
BREED IT AND THEY COULD BE

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:24.547
KILLED WITHOUT IN CONSEQUENCE.

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:26.516
DESPITE THAT SOME FIFTY MILLION

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:28.117
AFRICANS WITH STOLEN FROM THE

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:29.685
CONTINENT OF AFRICA.

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.154
ONLY FIFTEEN MILLION MADE IT TO

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.289
THE UNITED STATES.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.657
WHICH SPEAKS ABOUT THE BRUTALITY

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.926
OF THE MIDDLE PASSAGE.

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.561
THE MANY WHO DIED ALONG THE WAY

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:40.329
WHO TOOK ILL.

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:41.297
THE MINI WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.366
ALONG THE WAY.

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:29.791
CLASS COMMUNITY.

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:31.760
ONLY TO GO THROUGH FOR THE DAY

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:33.862
OF INSPECTION TO SEE A TO

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:35.931
APPROVE THE HOUSE.

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.566
DISCOVERED IN THE MASTER BEDROOM

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:40.335
KKK WAS CARVED INTO THE DOOR OF

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:41.336
THE CLOSET.

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:43.171
FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM.

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:44.740
AND THE ONLY CLAIM HE DIDN'T SEE

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:47.342
THAT INITIALLY.

01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:48.844
SO WE ARE CONSTANTLY CONFRONTED

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:51.280
WITH THE REALITY THAT RACISM IS

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:53.448
DEEP IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:55.751
AND IT HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:57.386
EVERYTHING.

01:15:57.452 --> 01:16:00.722
ON HEALTH CARE ONE EDUCATION ON

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:03.358
VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES AND THINGS

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:04.860
THAT WE MEET EACH AND EVERY DAY.

01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:06.662
AND WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.664
JUST TURN OUR EYES AND LOOK AWAY.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.699
BECAUSE THE LACK OF EDUCATION IS

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.668
INTENTIONAL.

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:14.503
IT IS FOR THAT LACK OF EDUCATION

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:15.537
THE FACT THAT WE WOULD BE

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:17.673
HUMANIZED IN THE HISTORY OF

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.741
AFRICANS WERE TAKEN AWAY.

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.677
WHEN YOU'LL GO TO EGYPT AND YOU

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:23.011
SEE THE HISTORY OF THIS OF

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:24.746
CIVILIZATION?

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:27.115
DONE BY AFRICANS A NEW CALL

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:29.785
INSIDE OF THE TUNES AND YOU SEE.

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:31.219
THAT THE COLOR IS STILL THERE

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:32.888
BECAUSE OF THE BRILLIANCE OF THE

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:35.724
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKES THE COLORS.

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:37.960
THOUSANDS OF YEARS LATER.

01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:39.728
AND YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:41.363
BRILLIANCE OF THE INDIVIDUALS

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:44.967
YET THAT HISTORY IS OFTEN STOLEN.

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:45.767
AND HEAR FROM THOSE WHO NEED IT

01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:47.536
SO MUCH.

01:16:47.602 --> 01:16:49.404
BUT IT ALSO GIVES THOSE WHO

01:16:49.471 --> 01:16:51.773
REFUSED TO DO THE HISTORY.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.710
THE COMFORT AND THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:57.779
TO DE HUMANIZE. TO LIMIT.

01:16:57.846 --> 01:16:59.147
AND OFTENTIMES TO DESTROY

01:16:59.214 --> 01:17:00.782
GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS OF

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:01.984
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN TERMS OF

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:04.252
THEIR SELF ESTEEM.

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:06.321
I CALL FOR YOU TODAY BECAUSE NOT

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:07.522
TO JUST SIMPLY SAY THIS IS BLACK

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:09.391
HISTORY MONTH.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.893
BUT TO RECOGNIZE A POLICIES OF

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.962
THIS HOUSE IN THIS STATE.

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:15.897
THAT CONTINUED TO DE HUMANIZE

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:18.166
AFRICAN AMERICANS.

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:19.501
THE FACT THAT WE CAN SHOOT

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:21.403
AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HAVE NO

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.538
REMORSE.

01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:25.440
IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE TO THE

01:17:25.507 --> 01:17:26.575
HEART.

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:28.110
AND THE SPIRIT OF THIS HOUSE.

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:30.746
AND THE STATION.

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:32.080
THAT WE CAN HAVE THINGS HAPPEN

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:33.515
THAT WE WOULD NOT ALLOW HAPPEN

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:34.850
ANYWHERE ELSE.

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:36.752
AND FEEL NO REMORSE.

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:38.553
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.122
ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF ACHIEVEMENT

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:42.324
IN THE STATE.

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:43.792
AND THERE IS NOT OUTRAGE.

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.761
OUTRAGE FROM THOSE OF US WHO

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:46.595
BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO

01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:48.430
ESTABLISH THE GREATEST

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:49.931
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN THE WORLD.

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:51.666
IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE THAT WE DO

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:53.368
NOT KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:55.704
PEOPLE WE ENSLAVED.

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:56.938
THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT BILL BUILT

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.206
THE FIRST LIBRARIES IN THE WORLD.

01:17:58.273 --> 01:18:00.042
WE WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE

01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:00.709
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:02.377
COUNTRY WHO HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:04.246
LITERACY RATE IN THE EARLY

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:04.846
NINETEEN HUNDREDS BECAUSE OF

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.214
THEIR BELIEF IN LITERACY AND

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:08.650
READING.

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:09.684
BUT THERE ARE THE ONES WHO

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:11.219
CREATED SUNDAY SCHOOL SO THEY

01:18:11.286 --> 01:18:12.154
COULD TEACH THE FORMER SLAVE TO

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.922
READ.

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:14.823
BUT THEY BILL BLACK COLLEGES

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:15.991
WHEN WE WOULD NOT ALLOW THEIR

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:16.725
CHILDREN TO GO TO COLLEGE

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:17.793
BECAUSE WHY THEY BELIEVED IN

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:19.261
HIGHER EDUCATION.

01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:21.196
MORE THAN SOMETIMES OF FARMERS

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:22.731
AND OTHERS WHO TOOK FOR GRANTED

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:24.699
THEIR WHITE STATUS WOULD ALWAYS

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:26.001
PROTECT THEM.

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:27.702
SO WHEN WE BEGIN TO SAY YES WE

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.704
BELIEVE IN THE RESOLUTION WE

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.573
HAVE TO BEGIN THE WORK.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.575
AND THAT WORK IS TO CHANGE THE

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:34.910
THE HISTORY OF THIS STATE AND

01:18:34.976 --> 01:18:36.545
THIS NATION.

01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:38.246
WE CONSISTENTLY PUT TOGETHER

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:39.614
PROPOSALS CONCERNING ETHNIC

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:42.551
STUDIES AND BLACK HISTORY AND

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:43.785
THE CHICANO KISSED HISTORY THAT

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:44.753
SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN THE STATE.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.188
AND WE ALWAYS COME UP WITH THE

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:48.156
SAME CONCLUSION IT COSTS TOO

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:50.425
MUCH.

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:51.726
I'VE BEEN TOLD IT IGNORES IS

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:52.227
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

01:18:52.294 --> 01:18:53.895
KNOWLEDGE.

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:56.731
THAT IT HAS PROFOUND IMPACT ON

01:18:56.798 --> 01:18:57.666
OUR LIVES.

01:18:57.732 --> 01:19:00.569
AND CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO BETTER.

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:03.038
IT HAS TO BEGIN TO SAY WE MUST

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:04.573
CHANGE HOW WE TEACH HISTORY.

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:05.674
AND IT MAY TAKE AWHILE BUT IT IS

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.476
WORTH DOING.

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:09.144
WE HAVE BEEN RAISING THIS ISSUE

01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:10.779
FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS IN THE

01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:12.314
STATE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:13.181
ETHNIC STUDIES.

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:14.649
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE

01:19:14.716 --> 01:19:16.751
HAPPENED IF WE HAD TAKEN ACTION

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:18.553
FIFTY YEARS AGO. TO CHANGE HOW

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:21.723
WE EDUCATE AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:22.824
IT'S HOW WE EDUCATE OUR TEACHERS

01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:24.426
AND EVENTUALLY WORK DOWN TO TALK

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:25.393
ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.129
BASICALLY HAVE A CURRICULUM THAT

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:28.630
IS A FULL CURRICULUM OF

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:30.132
CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY.

01:19:30.198 --> 01:19:31.900
IN OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM.

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.001
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT TIME IS

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:34.970
UP?

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:36.304
WE HAVE BEEN FACED WITH THE

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:38.540
REALITY AS WE LOOK AT THINGS

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:39.774
THAT ARE HAPPENING IN VIRGINIA

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:41.409
AND ELSEWHERE THAT RACISM IS

01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:43.478
ALIVE AND WELL AND GETTING FAT

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:44.980
IN THIS NATION.

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:46.548
AND WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.383
SIMPLY HAVE RESOLUTIONS THAT

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.951
CALL FOR US TO KNOW OUR HISTORY.

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:51.486
WE MUST BEGIN THE ACTION OF

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:52.787
MAKING SURE THAT EVERY CHILD

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:54.222
KNOWS IT.

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:55.490
THAT WE STAND BY IT AND THAT

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:57.125
WHEN WE DO THAT WE CHANGE WHO WE

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:58.493
ARE.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.761
AND WE CHANGE THE FUTURE FOR

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:02.230
CHILDREN TO COME.

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:03.832
