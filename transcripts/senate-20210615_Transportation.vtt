00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:42.627
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:44.763
IN PUBLIC SAFETY ANYWAY WHILE I

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.898
WAS HERE WE DID NOT MOVE

00:22:46.965 --> 00:22:48.900
FORWARD TO FIND THESE BILLS AND

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:50.836
THE REASON THAT WE DID NOT IS

00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:52.904
BECAUSE THE DATA THAT WE HAVE

00:22:52.971 --> 00:22:56.241
REVIEWED INDICATES THAT WHILE.

00:22:56.308 --> 00:23:00.679
I WELL CERTAINLY THERE IS THE-

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:04.216
DESIRE TO INCREASE THE PENALTY

00:23:04.282 --> 00:23:07.519
WE FOUND NO DATA TO INDICATE

00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:10.222
THAT DOING SO REDUCE THE

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:12.891
BEHAVIORS SO IN OTHER WORDS IF

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:14.659
WE THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCE

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:15.827
WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO WE'RE

00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:17.462
TRYING TO PREVENT THE KIND OF

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:20.365
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE FAMILY

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:22.367
THAT WE HEARD FROM EXPERIENCE

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:24.202
THAT IS WHAT THAT WOULD BE

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:27.873
OBJECTIVE HOWEVER. THE INCREASE

00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:29.841
OF A PENALTY OF THE SORT DOES

00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:32.744
NOT HAVE THAT CONSEQUENCE YES

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:34.446
IT PENALIZES SOMEONE WHO

00:23:34.513 --> 00:23:36.314
PARTICIPATES IN A SLIDE SHOW

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:38.016
MORE BUT IT DOES NOT

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.618
NECESSARILY REDUCE THE

00:23:39.684 --> 00:23:42.687
INCIDENCE OF THEM. AND WHEN WE

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:45.657
THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:48.393
THE- FOR EXAMPLE A LICENSE

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.829
SUSPENSION- AND THE INABILITY

00:23:50.896 --> 00:23:52.964
THEN POTENTIALLY FOR A PERSON

00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:55.066
TO GO TO WORK AND SUCH THERE'S

00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:57.969
THEY CAN SPIRAL INTO MULTIPLE

00:23:58.036 --> 00:24:01.807
OTHER IMPACTS AND THIS DOES NOT

00:24:01.873 --> 00:24:04.509
THE THIS PARTICULAR BILL.

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:06.545
THERE'S WHILE WE CERTAINLY DO

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.613
NOT WANT TO HAVE ANY ANY

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.316
INJURIES OR RESULTS OR ANY HARM

00:24:11.383 --> 00:24:13.485
TO PEOPLE BECAUSE OF ANY KIND

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:15.487
OF ACTIVITY LIKE THIS THIS DOES

00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:17.222
NOT REQUIRE THAT ANYONE TO BE

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:22.894
HURT AND SO AGAIN. IT'S THE

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:24.629
CONCERN OF. SELECT DIFFERENT OR

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:28.466
WHO AM UP BEING AT. UNDER UNDER

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:32.270
INCREASING PENALTIES SO- I

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:35.774
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT.

00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.976
AND I VERY MUCH RESPECT THE-

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:41.112
THOSE- THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:42.914
IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.850
THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE DANGER

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:48.286
OF THESE BUT BECAUSE OF THE

00:24:48.353 --> 00:24:50.021
LACK OF DATA THAT SHOWS THAT IT

00:24:50.088 --> 00:24:51.990
WOULD ACTUALLY IMPACT THE

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:54.826
REDUCTION OF THESE INCIDENTS I

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.928
CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK

00:24:56.995 --> 00:24:59.598
YOU SENATOR SCANNER I DON'T SEE

00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:01.600
ANY MORE UP SENATOR MELINDA'S.

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:03.535
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I HAVE A

00:25:03.602 --> 00:25:05.503
QUESTION FOR YOU IS SOME WOMEN

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.539
FIND NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN-

00:25:07.606 --> 00:25:09.941
YOUR BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.543
THE LICENSE IS SUSPENDED IT

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.445
AUTHORIZES THE REVOCATION OF IS

00:25:13.511 --> 00:25:16.181
THAT CORRECT. YES EIGHT ALLOWS

00:25:16.248 --> 00:25:17.449
THE COURT TO MAKE A PROPER

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:18.350
DECISION BASED ON THE

00:25:18.416 --> 00:25:20.051
CIRCUMSTANCES UPON CONVICTION

00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:22.520
NOT THE CITATION SO IF- AT

00:25:22.587 --> 00:25:24.256
ONCE- IF I THERE'S A FORMAL

00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:25.857
CONVICTION THE JUDGE WILL HAVE

00:25:25.924 --> 00:25:30.161
THE ABILITY- TO- TO IT. BUT

00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:31.396
REMOVE SOMEONE'S LICENSE BUT

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:33.064
WHAT WE'RE ARGUING AND WHAT

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.499
WE'RE WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:35.967
NOT INCREASING PENALTIES BUT

00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:37.569
JUST TO CREATE PARITY BETWEEN

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:39.604
THE TWO AT THE TWO BEHAVIORS.

00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:41.673
RIGHT OKAY AND THAT MAKES SENSE

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.642
TO ME IT'S NOT A MANDATE IT'S

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:44.910
AN OPTION THAT WE WOULD LEAVE

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:46.278
UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE

00:25:46.344 --> 00:25:49.781
JUDGE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE-A CASE WHERE SOMEONE IS BEFORE

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:51.683
THE COURT FOR THIS VERY REASON

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.051
MULTIPLE TIMES. THEN IT WOULD

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:54.252
PROBABLY BE IN THE BEST

00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:55.854
INTEREST FOR PUBLIC SAFETY FOR

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:58.290
A JUDGE TO REVOKE THAT LICENSE

00:25:58.356 --> 00:26:00.458
TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE- IF HE

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:03.261
FEELS THAT'S NECESSARY AND ARE

00:26:03.328 --> 00:26:04.763
YOU KNOW I'M NOT I'VE NEVER

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:09.334
UNDERSTOOD THE. ARGUMENT THAT-

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:12.437
PUNISH TODAY DETER IF THAT IS

00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:13.772
THE ARGUMENT OVER TO USE THEN

00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:16.608
WHY. **** ANYBODY FOR ANYTHING.

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:18.777
IF YOU CAN'T SOLIDLY PROVE THAT

00:26:18.843 --> 00:26:20.512
THE PUNISHMENT WILL DECREASE

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:22.614
THE CRIME THEN WHY IN CURSOR TO

00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:25.951
ANYONE UNLESS THE GOAL IS TO.

00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:27.319
NOT INCARCERATE ANYONE FOR

00:26:27.385 --> 00:26:29.321
ANYTHING I'M NOT I'M NOT REALLY

00:26:29.387 --> 00:26:31.957
SURE BUT I THINK THIS IS-

00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:34.159
INTELLIGENT LEGISLATION FOR A

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:36.027
PROBLEM THAT. HAS COME INTO

00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:38.596
BEING- THAT WE'VE NOT DEALT

00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:39.831
WITH IN THE PAST SO I THINK

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:41.900
IT'S A GOOD PUBLIC SAFETY-

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:43.902
EFFORT AND CERTAINLY GOOD

00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:45.470
TRANSPORTATION EFFORT AND SO

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:46.938
WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:47.973
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU

KIND OF BAFFLED BY THIS WAS

00:26:58.016 --> 00:26:59.784
HAPPENING HERE WE HAVE. REASONS

00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:03.421
FOR LOSS AND THEN WHEN PEOPLE.

00:27:03.488 --> 00:27:03.922
THERE'S CONSEQUENCES FOR

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:06.524
BREAKING OFF. AND THIS IS A

00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:08.626
COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO AN

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:12.163
ISSUE WHERE THE VICTIMS. IT

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.598
CONTINUES TO HAPPEN INTEL INTEL

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:16.301
YOU PUSH TO MAKE IT TO WHERE

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:18.036
THE RISK IS HIGHER THAN THE

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:20.071
PUNISHMENT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:21.506

VETOED BEFORE- I WILL MOVE THE

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:31.483
BILL I THINK IT'S COMMON SENSE

00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:33.585
AND I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT

00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:35.453
THING TO DO- IN. GOOD LUCK THIS

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.154

AT INCHED HINDSIGHT TO MY

00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:50.168
COMMENTS WERE NOT. A

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:53.204
COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH CERTAINLY

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:55.707
THEIR PUNISHMENT IS APPROPRIATE

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:56.908
INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER IT

00:27:56.975 --> 00:27:59.244
pDETERS CRIME SO I WANT TO MAKE

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.479
SURE THAT MY COMMENTS WERE NOT

00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:02.647
CONSTRUED THAT SOMEHOW WE

00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:04.482
SHOULD NEVER PASS A LAW JUST

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:06.451
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DETER- ON

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:08.486
WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID INSTEAD

00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:10.388
WHICH HAS BEEN BROUGHT OUT SO

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:11.823
FAR IN THE TESTIMONY IS THAT WE

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.392
HAVE EXISTING LAWS. THAT MAKE

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:15.760
THIS A CRIME THAT HAVE

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:19.130
CONSEQUENCES TO THIS AND THAT-

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:25.036
WE'RE ON THE V. EIGHT THE STATE.

00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:25.837
IN FACT WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID

00:28:25.904 --> 00:28:27.272
THAT THIS IS SOMEONE DUPLICATE

00:28:27.338 --> 00:28:29.707
AND WHILE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT

00:28:29.774 --> 00:28:31.543
IS AND FEELS THERE NEEDS TO BE

00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:34.479
AN ADDITION. IT'S THERE IS

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:37.048
EXISTING CODE ON THE BOOKS THAT

00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:40.118
DOES MAKE THIS ACTIVITY ILLEGAL

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:42.320
WITH CONSEQUENCES. THANK YOU

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:44.589
SENATOR SKINNER. I DON'T SEE

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:45.723
ANYMORE MIKE'S UP I WILL

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.358
CONCLUDE BY SAYING- I WANT TO

00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:48.460
THANK OU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FONG I

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:49.794
KNOW WE HAD A QUICK DISCUSSION

00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:52.363
YESTERDAY AND- ALTHOUGH I'M

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:53.231
ALSO OF THE MINDSET I DON'T

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:54.933
WANT TO BE SUPER PUNITIVE ON ON

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:57.235
CERTAIN ISSUES AND I BELIEVE

00:28:57.302 --> 00:28:58.403
THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE A

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.337
LITTLE BIT MORE MINDFUL IN THE

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:00.939
WAY WERE. ENFORCING AND HOW

00:29:01.005 --> 00:29:02.740
WE'RE CRAFTING- PUNISHMENTS FOR

00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:04.442
ENFORCEMENT IN IN ANY WAY I

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:05.643
KNOW THAT THIS IS OPTIONAL AS

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.812
YOU MENTIONED IT IS AN OPTION%

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:08.446
BASED ON THE DEGREE OF THAT THE

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:10.849
OFFENSE- BUT I'M OF THE MINDSET

00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:12.183
TO THAT WE NEED MORE EDUCATION

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.085
OFTEN TIMES- EXHIBITION OF

00:29:14.152 --> 00:29:15.353
SPEED GETS CLUMPED IN WITH

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.621
SPEED CONTESTS AND SO WE NEED

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:18.289
TO BE. VERY CLEAR ON WHAT THAT

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:19.324
IS AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:19.891
DOING THIS HERE WITH THIS

00:29:19.958 --> 00:29:21.993
LEGISLATION. AND AS WELL AS-

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.928
MORE EDUCATION TO PEOPLE NEED

00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:25.563
TO BE EDUCATED ON EXACTLY WHAT

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.065
EXACT EXHIBITION OF SPEED IS

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:29.534
AND HOW NOT TO- TO CONDUCT THAT

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:32.537
TYPE OF BEHAVIOR- AND SO THAT

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:33.438
WAY WE CAN HAVE SAFER STREETS

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:34.639
SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY

00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:35.673
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.542
THIS FORWARD AND WE WILL ALLOW

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.377
YOU TO CLOSE THE GO RED HAT. I

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:40.645
JUST LIKE TO THINK THAT SHE'S A

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.514
YOUTH CHAIR FOR- FOR ALLOWING

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.915
THIS BILL TO ADD TO IT TO BE

00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:45.350
PRESENTED AND TO THAT TO THE

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:48.453
ROBUST CONVERSATION- CERTAINLY-

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.220
THREE RACING IN THE EXHIBITION

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:52.157
SPEED THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE THE

00:29:52.223 --> 00:29:53.391
NUMBER THE MEDITATIONS THE

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:55.026
AMOUNT OF DEVASTATION REX

00:29:55.093 --> 00:29:57.695
TRAGEDIES- ARE ON THE RISE AT

00:29:57.762 --> 00:29:59.797
THEIR SURGING- AS WE'VE SEEN.

00:29:59.864 --> 00:30:00.999
AND THIS IS A BIPARTISAN

00:30:01.065 --> 00:30:03.601
EFFORT- THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

00:30:03.668 --> 00:30:05.336
