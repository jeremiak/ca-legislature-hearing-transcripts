DOCTOR WEBER YOU MAY OPEN. MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY AB THREE NINE TWO THE CALIFORNIA ACT TO SAVE LIVES. THIS BILL SEEKS TO RAISE CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL STANDARD FOR WHEN POLICE CAN USE DEADLY FORCE. TO MATCH BEST PRACTICES ALREADY IN PLACE AT SOME DEPARTMENTS AND THAT WE KNOW WORK TO KEEP BOTH OFFICERS AND PUBLIC SAFE. RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL HAVE CLARIFIED ITS MEANING AND REMOVED OPPOSITION FROM NUMEROUS LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS INCLUDING. THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS PORAC THE CALIFORNIA STATE WHY LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND SEVERAL OTHER STATEWIDE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS. I LIKE TO NOT AS LONG FOR TWO GROUPS AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM. AND THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE. THIS BILL WILL ONLY WORK BECAUSE OF THE BUY IN FROM THE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO'S WORKED SO VERY HARD ON GETTING US TO THIS POINT. I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM TONI ATKINS SPEAKER RENDON AND THE GOVERNOR FOR DEVOTING TIME AND SO MUCH ENERGY INTO THIS ISSUE. I WANT TO THANK MY JOINT AUTHORS AND CO AUTHORS TO STAND WITH FAMILIES ON THIS BILL. I WANT TO THANK THE CO SPONSORS WHO HAVE WORKED SO TIRELESSLY FOR SO LONG ON THIS ISSUE. AND LASTLY MOST IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO UPLIFT THE ADVOCACY OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE TURNED THE TRAGEDIES THEY HAVE INDOOR IT UP INTO A MOVEMENT. TO ENSURE THE OTHER FAMILIES EXPERIENCE DO NOT EXPERIENCE THE LOSS OF THEIR LOVED ONES. POLICE OFFICERS SHOULD NEVER TAKE A HUMAN LIFE WHEN THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES. AB THREE NINE TWO IS ABOUT PREVENTING UNNECESSARY DEATHS BY CLARIFYING LAW ENFORCEMENT OBLIGATION WHEN MAKING THE DECISION TO USE DEADLY FORCE. AB THREE NINE TWO REPLACES THE CURRENT VAGUE STANDARD THAT OFFICES CAN USE DEADLY FORCE WHENEVER REASONABLE STANDARDS% WITH A HIGHER STANDARD THAT AUTHORIZES DEADLY FORCE. ONLY WHEN NECESSARY TO DEFEND AGAINST AN IMMINENT THREAT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. THIS BILL IS SQUARELY IN LINE WITH BEST PRACTICES AND STANDARDS RECOGNIZED BY ACADEMICS AND EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. INCLUDING CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND IS MODELED AFTER PRACTICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE AT SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. THESE STANDARDS ARE KNOWN TO REDUCE SERIOUS USE OF FORCE WITHOUT HAVING ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OFFICER SAFETY OR PUBLIC SAFETY. AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL ALL AGENCIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO UPDATE THEIR POLICIES TO INCLUDE THESE BEST PRACTICES AND IT SURE THAT OFFICERS ARE TRAINED TO THE STANDARDS. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY OVER TEN ORGANIZATIONS AND OVER TWO HUNDRED GROUPS IN SUPPORT. THE POWER OF POLICE OFFICERS TO USE DEADLY FORCE IS PROUD PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY WE CONFER ON ANY PUBLIC OFFICIAL. AND IT MUST BE GUIDED BY THE GOALS OF SAFEGUARDING ALL HUMAN LIFE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I VOTE FOR AB. THREE NINE TWO THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MISTER MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE AS A CO AUTHOR OF AB. THREE NINETY TWO A BULLET WHEN FIRED CANNOT BE CALLED BACK. ALIVE TAKEN COULD NOT BE RESTORED. THAT'S WHY STANDS STRONGLY BEHIND THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THIS BILL. THAT POLICE ONLY USE DEADLY FORCE WHEN NECESSARY. CALIFORNIA POLICE OFFICERS USE DEADLY FORCE AT A RATE. FAR HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. NEARLY HALF OF THE PEOPLE KILLED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. ARE LATINO. FOUR OF THE FIVE YOUNG PEOPLE. KILLED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WERE LATINO. IT ISN'T SURPRISING THAT MANY. PEOPLE IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY FEEL THE DISTRESS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AB THREE NINETY TWO IS AN IMPORTANT STEP. TO RESTORE THAT TRUST BETWEEN THESE COMMUNITIES. BY RAISING THE STANDARD FOR PER LEASE USE OF LETHAL FORCE FROM REASONABLE TO NECESSARY. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL OF POLICING IS TO PROTECT HUMAN LIFE. NO MATTER WHOSE LIFE IT IS. TO THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE IN THE FACE OF OVERWHELMING LOS. WITHOUT YOUR ADVOCACY AND LEADERSHIP NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE. MANY THANKS ALSO TO THE LEADERSHIP ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. WE KNOW THE DIFFICULT ISSUES NEED BOLD LEADERSHIP. AND A DRIVEN SENSE OF OUR SHARED WHO HUMANITY. AB THREE NINETY TWO IS ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH. AND I ASKED RESPECTFULLY THAT YOU JOIN ME IN STANDING WHEN THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES AND VOTE HI AN A. B.. THREE NINETY TWO THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA MR HOLDEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- I STAND TODAY AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL -- THREE NINETY TWO BUT I'D LIKE TO SAY. THAT AND START OFF BY SAYING WITH GREAT THANKS AND APPRECIATION TO AUTHOR FOR HER TO NOW CITY. OR HER ARTWORK. AND HER INCREDIBLE PATIENCE AND DILIGENCE AND WORKING WITH ALL PARTIES TO BRING RESOLUTION TO THIS IMPORTANT BILL. I HAVE NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR THE MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO IS WILLING AND ABLE TO NEGOTIATE WITH ALL PARTIES. TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WHILE MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF HER BILL. AB THREE NINETY TWO MAKES EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. AB THREE NINETY TO PULL SUCCESSFUL USE OF FORCE POLICIES. FROM AGENCIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED THEM AND PUTS THESE BEST PRACTICES IN THE STATE LAW. CHANGING THE USE OF FORCE STANDARD IN CALIFORNIA WILL CHANGE THE WAY OFFICERS ARE TRAINED TO PURSUE OTHER NON DEADLY RESOURCES OR TECHNIQUES WHEN ENGAGING WITH THE PUBLIC. AND CITIES RESTRICTOR USE OF FORCE POLICIES POLICE KILL FEWER PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT A LAW ENFORCEMENT OR COMMUNITY SAFETY. SEATTLE FOR EXAMPLE SO REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS AFTER ADOPTING. A USE OF FORCE THAT ARE LIKE THE ONE IN AB. THREE NINETY TWO WITHOUT SEEING ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PUBLIC OR POLICE SAFETY. SAN FRANCISCO ALSO SAW SIMILAR DECLINES AND USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS. SAN FRANCISCO PD HASN'T SHOT ANYONE IN ALMOST A YEAR AFTER ADOPTING ITS CHANGE IN POLICY. WE GIVE POLICE OFFERS OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POWER WE GIVE IN A PUBLIC EMPLOYEE. THE POWER TO KILL. WE WAS MAKE SURE POLICE USE THAT POWER JUDICIOUSLY WITH RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. AND ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. WE MUST ALSO HOLD POLICE ACCOUNTABLE WHENEVER THEY MISS USE THAT POWER. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB. THREE NINETY TWO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING MR MCCARTY YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I HOPE WE CAN ALL SUPPORT THIS A MEASURE TODAY I THINK IT'S A FAIR COMPROMISE. AND REALLY IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE TO UPDATE TO MODERNIZE OUR DEADLY FORCE RULES AFTER NEARLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS BUT BEFORE WE GET THAT I I ALSO WANT. TO SAY I'M A PROUD JOINT AUTHOR BUT MORE MORE POORLY I'M PROUD TO JOIN. OUR OUR LEADER FROM SAN DIEGO WHO WAS FEARLESS AND DOG GET IN GETTING US TO THIS POINT SO I WANT TO THANK. HER LEADERSHIP. AND AGAIN WE WE KNOW IT'S TIME% FOR CHANGE BECAUSE IT WE SEE IT WITH OUR OWN TWO EYES. NO TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WE SAW THE VIDEO AND LA OF RODNEY KING AND IT WAS A RARE OPPORTUNITY WHEN YOU SAW SOMEONE TAKING A HOME VIDEO. NOW WE SEE IT WITH DASH CAMS WITH BODY CAMS FROM CAMERAS FROM CELL PHONES FROM INDIVIDUALS FROM STOREFRONTS WE SEE IT WITH OUR OWN TO RICE. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THERE HAS TO BE. A BETTER WAY. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE PARSING THE WORDS AS FAR AS REASONABLE WHEN NECESSARY AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS BECAUSE OF THIS LAW POLICE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA LIKE WE'RE DOING RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AFTER STUFF ON CLARK ARE FOCUSING ON DE ESCALATION ALTERNATIVE TACTICS TO DO THEIR JOBS KEEP COMMUNITIES SAFE WHILE ALSO. SAVING LIVES AND WE HAVE MONEY IN THE STATE BUDGET TO IMPLEMENT THESE PRACTICES WE ALSO THE COMPANION BILL WHICH DEALS WITH THESE EXACT ISSUES SO THIS REALLY IS ABOUT. OPPORTUNITIES FOR DE ESCALATION. AND I KNOW THAT 99% OF THE TIME LAW OFFICERS DO THEIR JOB. BUT EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE THERE'S A 1% WEATHER IS NOT ACCOUNTABILITY. WE'VE SEEN THAT IN LOS ANGELES LAST YEAR AN INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICER SHOT AN INDIVIDUAL. IN THE BACK A HOMELESS MAN I BELIEVE IN YOUR DISTRICT. THE POLICE CHIEF OF THE CITY OF LA THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN AMERICA SAID THE OFFICER SHOULD BE FIRED. AND PROSECUTED THE POLICE CHIEFS AT THIS [inaudible] RARE OCCURRENCE. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID I CAN'T DO IT THE LAW DOESN'T JUSTIFY THAT SO THERE ARE. INDIVIDUAL STORIES WE KNOW THAT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. FIFTY MILES DOWN THE ROAD A RANCH RECORD OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HAD INDIVIDUAL CORN ON A FREEWAY HAD A BARRICADE A CAR THE INDIVIDUALS THROWING ROCKS. THEY THEY THEY DISCHARGE THE WEAPON INDIVIDUAL DIED OUR FORMER POLICE CHIEF OF THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO DID INVESTIGATION AND SAID THAT. THE ACTIVITIES PUT THE PUBLIC AT RISK IT WAS UNNECESSARY AND THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF GOING ABOUT IT. BUT AGAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID. THE LAW SAYS WE CAN'T HOLD ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS INSTANCE SO WE DO KNOW THERE ARE RARE OCCASIONS SO THIS ISN'T ABOUT. PROSECUTOR LOCKING UP INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DOING THEIR JOB BUT WHEN THERE IS SOMEBODY DOES CROSS THE LINE THERE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY SO THIS IS WHAT THIS MEASURE IS. BRINGS ABOUT MODERNIZATION TO OUR PRACTICE IS FOCUSED ON DE ESCALATION AND BRINGS ABOUT REASONABLE ACCOUNTABILITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE NINETY TWO NOW I WANT TO THANK. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR CHAMPIONING AND FOR LEADING THIS ENTIRE BODY. ON THIS VERY -- DIFFICULT CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING. FOR THE LAST. RECENT YEARS YOU KNOW AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR FOR MAY. I I APPROACHED. DOCTOR WEBER EARLY ON YOU KNOW MY MAIN CONCERN WHICH IS WELL. WE ALL I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS. AN URGENT ISSUE THAT -- THAT WE MUST CONFRONT [inaudible] AND THAT. THE STATUS QUO IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. BUT MY CONCERN WAS ALWAYS FOR MY EXPERIENCE AS A PROSECUTOR MIGHT MY WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. ARE PEOPLE THAT WENT INTO THAT THAT BECAME LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO HELP THE COMMUNITIES THEY WANT TO SERVE THE COMMUNITIES AND THEY WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OFFICERS OF GOOD FAITH WE'RE NOT [inaudible] PUNISHED. FOR HAVING TO MAKE THE OFTEN DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE. IN THE LINE OF DUTY TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO. DOCTOR WEBER I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR CHAMPIONING AND ESTABLISHING ONE OF THE STRONGEST STANDARDS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE WILL HAVE THROUGH AB. THREE NINETY TWO WHILE MAKING SURE. THAT WE ARE NOT PUNISHING. OUR MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OF GOOD FAITH. GORGEOUS GOING OUT EVERY DAY TRYING. TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND SERVE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MISS KOREA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED MEMBERS IF YOU LIKE TO BE RECOGNIZED PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW. MISS KOREA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER COURAGEOUS POSITION ON THIS BILL I AM PROUD TO HAVE JOINED. AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR I'D LIKE TO JUST SHARE THAT PRIOR TO JOINING TO THE LEGISLATURE I WAS WORKING AS A JOURNALIST. I COVER THE POLICE SHOOTINGS OF FREDDIE GRAY. FLANNEL CASTEEL [inaudible] ALTON STERLING [inaudible] ERIC GARDNER. AND TO MERE RICE WHO WAS ONLY. TWELVE WE MUST SAY THEIR NAMES AND WE MUST REMEMBER WHO THEY ARE. AND THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF MANY. WHAT I SAW AS A JOURNALIST WAS THE CONTINUOUS VIDEOS PLAYED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER? TO THE POINT THAT WE HAVE BECOME INCREDIBLY DE SENSITIZED AS A SOCIETY WHEN WE LITERALLY SEE SOMEONE BEING SHOT. IN OUR LOCAL NEWS. THE MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT OF THAT. TO THE RECEIVER TO THE VIEWER TO THE FAMILIES. AND TO THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO MUST ADDRESS. I WOULD GO HOME AT NIGHT AND JUST WANT TO SHUT DOWN. AND I WASN'T NECESSARILY THE ONE IMPACTED I JUST HAD TO COVER IT AND SEE IT OVER AND OVER. YOUNG KIDS THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO IN MY COMMUNITY IN THE FIFTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. HAVE SIMILAR FEARS. YOUNG BOYS OF COLOR IN MY COMMUNITY. WHO WANT TO BE ABLE TO LIVE AND THRIVE AND LIVE IN DIGNITY? AND NOT BE AFRAID. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IN CONVERSATIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEIR OWN FEARS. ABOUT THE HARSH REALITIES OF THE JOBS THAT THEY DO. AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE CIVILIANS MAY NOT NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT THEY DO EVERY SINGLE DAY. BUT I AM THANKFUL THAT THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE TAKEN HAVE GONE TO THE POINT WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT RECOGNIZED. THE IMPORTANT CRITICAL POSITION THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN. AND TOOK A POSITION TO DO SOMETHING. WHICH IS A GREAT BOLD NEW STEP FOR CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THE NATION. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE THAT WE WILL VOTE. IN THIS YEAR. OR PERHAPS IN MANY YEARS TO COME. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA CAN CERTAINLY SET THE TONE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE REALITY OF THIS WORK AND THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS HAD ON FAMILIES? ACROSS CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND I HOPE THAT THE CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE SO THAT WE COME TO RESOLUTIONS. AS TO THE IMPACT THAT THIS HAS HAD ON FAMILIES. THE IMPACT THAT THIS HAS ON THE JOB OF ACTUALLY BEING A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. AND HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS JUSTICE. AND THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDED FOR BOTH SIDES. IS AVAILABLE. AND A RESOURCE SO I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I'M AN AYE VOTE AND I AM SO HONORED AND PROUD TO HAVE JOINED AS A PRINCIPAL COOPER ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS CARILLO MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS -- I WAS GOING TO BE A VERY STRONG NO. ON AB THREE NINETY TWO AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED. BUT I WANT TO SAY TO THE AUTHOR. THAT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THE WAY THAT YOU'VE GONE ABOUT THIS PROCESS -- I I I JOKED WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY. THAT. WE'RE PART OF THE OLD SCHOOL CAUCUS. AND I SAY THAT WITH PRIDE BECAUSE I THINK IN THIS BODY WE CAN SHOW HOW WE CAN DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. THAT -- THAT WE CAN GET OUT OF OUR SILOS. ON BOTH SIDES. AND NOT APPROACH POLICY MAKING FROM THIS THE STANDPOINT OF MY WAY OR NO WAY. IN TRYING TO RAILROAD THROUGH A POLICY WITHOUT. GETTING ALL THE INPUT AND YOU DID THAT I WATCHED YOU WORK THROUGH THIS PROCESS. MEETING WITH COUNTLESS MEMBERS MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. LISTEN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. AND I THINK THAT'S VERY LAUDABLE NEEDS TO BE COMMENDED. BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SPENT A LOT OF HOURS WORKING THROUGH MANY OF THESE ISSUES. AND I AS I THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE -- WE CERTAINLY CAN'T IGNORE WHAT'S GOING ON OUT IN SOCIETY WE CANNOT IGNORE. THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TRAGIC DEATHS OF UNARMED CIVILIANS. BUT WE ALSO CANNOT IGNORE THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE BEING TARGETED. AND THERE'S BEEN FAR TOO MANY OFFICERS. WITHOUT ANY NOTICE SHOT AND KILLED TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES. AND WE NEED TO SAY THEIR NAMES. TO DAVID MOBILE YO. FROM RED BLUFF [inaudible] NATALIE CORONA. FROM OUR BUCKLE [inaudible] AUSTIN STEPHENS. THE CHP OFFICER WHO IS JUST DOING A ROUTINE STOP. AND WAS SHOT AND KILLED TAKEN AWAY FROM HIS FAMILY A YOUNG MOTHER. IN PALM SPRINGS. WHO SIMPLY WENT? TO A DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE CALL. OFFICERS ARE BEING TARGETED SO I WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THIS LEGISLATION. DOESN'T PUT OUR OUR OFFICERS LIVES IN JEOPARDY. AND I WAS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED IT DID. PUTTING THAT NECESSARY STANDARD IN PLACE. WAS GOING TO PUT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN JEOPARDY. AND I WANT TO READ. FROM THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT. THE DECISION BY A POLICE BY A PEACE OFFICER PERMISSION TO READ -- WITHOUT A JUST BIGGER. THE DECISION THE DECISION BY A PEACE OFFICER TO USE FORCE SHALL BE EVALUATED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A REASONABLE OFFICER IN THE SAME SITUATION. BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO OR PERCEIVED BY THE OFFICER AT THE TIME. RATHER THAN WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. IT SHOULD NOT BE TO THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE UNTRAINED. WHO WERE NOT THERE? WHO DIDN'T KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO SECOND GUESS WHAT AN OFFICER DOES? IN THESE HIGHLY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. IT HAS TO BE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A TRAINED REASONABLE. OFFICER AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY [inaudible] SUPERMAJORITY. OF OUR OFFICERS ARE WELL TRAINED AND THEY HANDLE THEMSELVES WITH CIVILIANS. SAFELY AND THEY DO IT HONORABLY AND THEY PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES ON A DAILY BASIS. IN THIS STANDARD RECOGNIZES THAT. AND THE A COMPANY BILL THAT WILL COME ENSURES THAT THERE IS PROPER TRAINING. THAT WE EXPAND UPON OUR TRAINING. SO THIS BILL I BELIEVE. WITH THE COMPROMISES MADE. STRIKES THE RIGHT STANDARD DO I LIKE EVERYTHING IN IT. NO. BUT THIS IS HOW POLICY SHOULD BE DONE. BY SITTING DOWN BY A COMPROMISE. AND THE AUTHOR LISTEN TO THE THE VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERNS OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY WHILE ALSO TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE FUTURE TRAGEDIES. LIKE WE HAVE THE STUFF ON CLERK AND I RECENTLY SPOKE AT THE UC DAVIS CAMPUS AND I WAS THERE BECAUSE I WAS CALLING OUT THE VICTORY ALL. OF THE UC DAVIS PROFESSOR. WHO HAD STATED? COP SHOULD BE KILLED THIRTY SACCHI SAID OWNER. COP SHOULD NOT BE REFORM THEY SHOULD BE KILLED THIS IS THE KIND OF RHETORIC THE GOING. THAT IS CAUSING MORE MORE DIVISION AND VIOLENCE. BUT I WAS THERE AND I SAID THIS VOTE FOLKS I SAID [inaudible] COLLEAGUES [inaudible] IS. IS THE HEARTACHE ANY LESS. FOR STUFF ON CLARK'S MOTHER. AS IT IS FOR THE MOTHER OF NATALIE CORONA [inaudible] NOW. THEY BOTH OF LOS SOMEONE THAT THEY'LL NEVER GET BACK. AND THAT'S WHY I SING COMMITTEE WE DO SOMETHING THAT DOES SOMETHING FOR BOTH. THEY PROTECT BOTH SIDES. IN A POLICY THAT JUST TRIES TO PUSH THROUGH AND STEAM STEAM ROLL THROUGH ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION IS NOT A FAIR POLICY IT IS THE DUTY OF THE LEGISLATOR. OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS JUST LAWS. AND SO I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FOR FORTUNE WHAT I THINK IS A REASONABLE COMPROMISE. IN THIS LEGISLATURE THAT PROTECTS THE LIVES OF OFFICERS AND THE LIVES OF THE PUBLIC THANK YOU. THERE WAS GALLAGHER MS GONZALEZ. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THING KILL ARISES OF HOW CO AUTHOR OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I WATCHED -- MY COLLEAGUE AND MY NEIGHBORING ASSEMBLY WOMAN. WE WE LITERALLY LIVE A FEW NOT WET MILE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER -- I'VE SEEN OUR WORK ON THIS FROM FROM THE DEEPEST PART OF HER SOUL. AN ISSUE THAT SO FEW PEOPLE WOULD TAKE ON I WANT TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR PEACE OFFICERS. YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN ONE WAS SHOT MY DISTRICT WE NEED TO BRIDGE AFTER -- WE UNDERSTAND WE MOURN WE PROSECUTE THOSE. WHO ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR AND THIS ISN'T? THIS BILL ISN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT BOTH SIDES WE WE DO THAT TYPE OF HONORING AS WE SHOULD. BUT THIS IS ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES WE LIVE IN. WHEN I FIRST GOT TO LEGISLATURE USED TO TELL PEOPLE I DIDN'T HEAR A LOT ABOUT POLICE BRUTALITY MY DISTRICT AND I DIDN'T? I HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE BORDER PATROL. I HEARD A LOT ABOUT BORDER PATROL SHOOTINGS. BUT OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS IT'S LIKE THERE'S BEEN SUCH A CHANGE THAT EVEN AND AND MY COMMUNITY. WHICH DOESN'T ALWAYS IT SEE THE REALITY OF BROWN FOLKS BEING THE SAME SUBJECT OF POLICE BRUTALITY IS BLACK FOLKS. THAT HAS CHANGED. AND WE LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE ARE IN FEAR IN THE SAME WAY WE USED TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE BEING FEAR NOT CALLING POLICE BECAUSE POLICE MY CALL IMMIGRATION. WE HAVE PEOPLE BEING IF YOU'RE NOT CALLING POLICE BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID. THAT THAT PERSON MIGHT GET SHOCKED. OR THAT THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT BE MISTAKEN AND BE SHOT. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER UNARMED INNOCENT INDIVIDUALS. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE BY POLICE OFFICERS. OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS THIS BILL TO REBUILD THAT TRUST THAT'S NECESSARY TO KEEP US ALL SAFE. I THINK DOCTOR WEBER I'M SORRY MY COLLEAGUE. FROM ACROSS THE ROAD. STRUCK THE PERFECT BALANCE. SHE ADAMANTLY AS PROTECTING A COMMUNITY THE DESERVES THAT PROTECTION. SHE'S PROVIDING A VOICE FOR A COMMUNITY THAT FOR TOO LONG. HAS BEEN STIFLED. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE WORKED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S TRAINING. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY IN THIS BODY TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE RESOURCES FOR THAT TRAINING. BECAUSE CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN JUST BY LAW. IT HAS TO HAPPEN BY THE WAY PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT TO IMPLEMENT THAT LAW. SO TODAY I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IN OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR THE HARD WORK -- THAT OUR COLLEAGUE HAS DONE IT WE DO THE RIGHT THING FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE MEET ALL FEEL SAFE WHEN WE CALL THE POLICE. THAT WE MAY ALL HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR PEACE OFFICERS OF ONE THAT WE BELIEVE. IT IS IS PURSUING SAFETY FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ITEM. FAMOUS GONZALEZ MISTER JONES SAWYER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE NINETY TWO AS A PROP CO AUTHOR. AND AS THE CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. AB THREE NINETY TWO IS AN INCREDIBLE IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARD CHANGING LAW ENFORCEMENT BEHAVIOR SPECIFICALLY DO USE OF DEADLY FORCE AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR CONTINUED ADVOCACY ON THIS ISSUE AND COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH STATE OAK HOLDERS I APPRECIATE THE WORK IS STAKEHOLDERS ON BOTH SIDES WHO WERE WILLING TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES. AND DO THE HARD WORK TO MOVE THIS ISSUE. FOR AS I HAVE BEEN IF I HAVE SAID SINCE COMMITTEE IF WE WANT TO SEE TRULY IMPACTFUL CHANGE. WE JUST WE CAN'T JUST CHANGE THE STANDARDS WE NEED TO ENSURE THOSE CHANGES ARE IMPLEMENTED BY COMMITTING RESOURCES TO TRAIN OFFICERS AND NEW POLICIES AND BEST PRACTICES. TODAY'S VOTE GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS PART OF THAT CONVERSATION PROVIDING A COMMONSENSE UPDATE TO OUR USE OF FORCE STANDARDS. AS I SAID IN COMMITTEE WHAT GOOD IS A POLICY WITHOUT THE BUY IN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHAT GOOD ARE REVISED TRAINING STANDARDS WITHOUT TO TROOP COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT? TODAY'S VOTE BOTH UPDATING OUR OUTDATED STANDARDS IN A WAY THAT IS WORKABLE FOR THOSE TASKED WITH ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY. TODAY WE CONTINUE TO HISTORIC WORK ON THIS ISSUE RAISING THE CURRENT REASONABLE STANDARD TO ONE THAT STATE DEADLY FORCE IS PERMISSIBLE WHEN NECESSARY WHEN CONSIDERING THE TOTALITY. OF THE SITUATION. ALSO AS I SAID EARLIER FEAR. HERE'S BEEN ARE OUR MAIN CHALLENGE WHEN WE COME TO THIS ISSUE. LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY ALL WANT TO GO HOME. WIVES AND FAMILIES THE HUSBANDS AND FAMILIES. BUT ALSO AS A BLACK MAN. THE BLACK MAN THAT'S PART OF THIS INSTITUTION. WHO IS TAUGHT WHEN HE WAS SIXTEEN GETTING HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE I WOULD DO DRIVER TRAINING? WHAT THE DRIVER EDUCATION? AND THEN I WENT TO BLACK DRIVER TRAINING. WHICH IS BASICALLY WHEN YOU GET BEHIND THE WHEEL LAW ENFORCEMENT STOPPED YOU IT'S TEN O'CLOCK TWO O'CLOCK. DON'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVES. DON'T DO ANYTHING DON'T REACH FOR THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT COULD YOU MAY NOT GET HOME. I AM SIXTY TWO YEARS OLD HAVE BEEN STOPPED RECENTLY. AND I STILL DO TEN O'CLOCK I STILL DON'T MOVE QUICKLY. BECAUSE I KNOW I MAY NOT GO HOME ONE DAY BY DO WHAT IS PERCEIVED. AS THE WRONG THING. I STILL WORRY AS I'M UP HERE I HAVE A SON WHO'S A TEACHER IN WHAT. I HAVE A SON WHO TAKE THE BUS HOME IS SEVENTEEN TAKE THE BUS HOME EVERY DAY. I'M MORE CONCERNED. ABOUT WHAT MAY HAPPEN IF MY SON JUST STOP BY LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT SOMETIMES THE GANGSTER IN WHAT'S. OR THE GANGS AROUND MY COMMUNITY. THAT IS NOT. THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE. THE MOST IMPORTANT I HAVE A ONE YEAR OLD GRANDSON. I DO NOT WANT TO TEACH HIM TEN O'CLOCK TWO O'CLOCK FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW. FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW. THIS BILL WILL HAVE STARTED A PROCESS. THAT NOT ONLY HE'LL SEE COMMUNITY. BUT ALSO REMOVES THAT FEAR. THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE FIFTY NINTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT OF SOUTH LA STILL HAS [inaudible] COLLEGE GRADUATE. I STILL HAVE THAT FEAR THAT I MAY NOT GO HOME WHEN THOSE LIGHTS ARE BEHIND. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. LAW ENFORCEMENT STILL HAS THE FEAR THAT IF THEY STOP SOMEONE THAT LOOKS LIKE ME. THAT THEY MAY NOT GO HOME. WE NEED THE END THAT WE NEED IN THAT WITH THE TRAINING. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IS IMPACTFUL. YESTERDAY I HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT IN MY OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND IT AFRICAN AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. REPEATED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THAT WE MUST MAKE SURE. WE HAVE RACIAL BIAS TRAINING. AS THE FOR FRONT. OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS FAR AS TRAINING. AND AS I TRY TO MOVE ON TO OTHER SUBJECTS HE PULLED ME BACK IN AND LOOKED ME STRAIGHT MAY I TO SAY I AM PLEADING WITH YOU. TO ENSURE THAT WHAT EVER TRAINING WHERE WE MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE IMPLEMENTATION. THIS IS THIS JUST SETS STANDARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS DONE. BUT IT'S STILL HARD WORK IS COMING FORWARD AFTER THAT WHICH IS THE TRAINING AND IMPLEMENTATION. AND SO I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT. THIS BILL AND ASKED THAT MY COLLEAGUES TO PUT TO PUT IT IN. TO PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO AND JUSTLY DIE AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS BILL. UNDER EACH AN AYE VOTE ON SB. THREE NINETY TWO THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER MISTER MATHIS YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I TO AGREE IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE. IT'S TIME THAT. WE ADDRESS THE SOCIETAL PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. WE TALK ABOUT. THIS NEED TO REDUCE THE FEAR OF LAW ENFORCEMENT [inaudible] AND MAKE SURE OUR CITIZENS ARE AFRAID OF THEM. AND YOU KNOW THIS FIRST MAKES ME THINK OF SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING BACK HOME WITH MY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. WHERE THEY'RE REACHING OUT TO OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES? AND OUR DEPUTIES ARE WORKING AS COACHES [inaudible] IN TEACHING. OUR COMMUNITIES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE TO BE FEARED. BUT I'VE ALSO GOT I WONDER. YOU KNOW WE WE TEACH OUR YOUTH. NO MEANS NO. BUT WHEN ARE WE GOING TO TEACH THEM STOP MEANS STOP. FREEZE MEANS FREEZE. WE'VE LOST THIS FUNDAMENTAL RESPECT. FOR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WE'VE GONE INTO THIS SOCIETAL. CHANGE OF VICTIMHOOD. INSTEAD OF PAYING THAT SIMPLE RESPECT. NOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA MENTIONED. THE TEN INTO IN THE FEAR. AND I AGREE WITH THEM THAT WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT. BUT WE ALSO. IN. A AS A PROUD WHITE GUY ONE OF THE KEYS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. I TEACH MY KIDS THE SAME THING. RESPECT LAW ENFORCEMENT. DON'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVES. BECAUSE I ALSO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT. AS A PROUD VETERAN. WHO'S BEEN IN COMBAT SITUATIONS. WHO KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS? TO HAVE TO DRAW WEAPON OUT ON SOMEBODY. TO ASK THEM TO STOP. TO ASK THEM TO FREEZE. BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO PULL THE TRIGGER. I DON'T KNOW ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN THAT I'VE EVER MET THAT I'VE EVER TALKED TO YOU. THAT WAKES UP IN THE MORNING AND SAYS I WANT TO GET UP AND GO SHOOT SOMEBODY. NO THEY GET UP IN THE MORNING. THEY KISS THEIR FAMILIES GOODBYE. THE DROP THEIR KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL. AND THEN THEY GO ON PATROL. BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN PROTECTING AND SERVING. OFFICE. AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE A DUTY. TO REALIZE THAT THE WORDS THAT WE SAY. CHANGE HOW SOCIETY IN THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT [inaudible] LOOK IT. WHAT HAPPENS ON THE DAY TO DAY? BECAUSE WHEN WE GO OUT THERE AND TELL THEM FEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY'RE GONNA BELIEVE THAT LIKE GOSPEL. WHEN WE GET OUT? AND WE SAY. NO WE NEED TO WORK AND HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY BELIEVE THAT MEMBERS WHAT WE TELL OUR COMMUNITIES. IS WHAT THEY TURN AROUND AND DO. BECAUSE THEY LOOK TO US FOR THAT LEADERSHIP. NOW I WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT SHE'S DON. AND THE ART OF COMPROMISE. IN GETTING THEIR BECAUSE THAT SHOWS. TRUE VALUE AS A LEGISLATURE IT SHOWS THAT. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM NICOLAS SAID WORK. SHE'S NOT TRYING TO STEAMROLL THIS BILL. BUT I THINK THAT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CONVERSATION. AND REALLY SAY WHAT ARE WE DOING AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. TO BRING THAT. COMMUNICATION THAT RESPECTS. BACK TO OUR CHILDREN. SO THEY KNOW DON'T FEAR THE OFFICERS THEY'RE THERE TO HELP. WE SHOULD LOOK TO THEM WE SHOULD RESPECT THEM. AND WHEN THEY PULL YOU OVER FOR THEY TELL YOU TO STOP. FOLLOW THEIR INSTRUCTIONS THEY SHOULDN'T BE A MATTER OF FEAR. IT SHOULD JUST BE A MATTER OF DOING THE RIGHT THING. IN TEACHING OUR NEXT GENERATION. THAT IT'S OKAY. HOW YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE A TAIL LIGHT OUT? YOU DON'T KNOW. BUT WE NEED TO TEACH THAT RESPECT AND GRAIN THAT BACK INTO OUR CHILDREN AND WE'VE LOST IT WHICH IS LED US TO THIS POINT THE WE'RE AT TODAY. SO MEMBERS ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. THERE WAS ROUGH AS MR STONE. YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL FACT I WAS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL LAST YEAR. AND KUDOS TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHOSE PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE HAS BROUGHT THIS BILL TO US TODAY. AND IN FACT IT'S BàN CONVERSATIONS THIS YEAR SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND DIDN'T BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF FEAR TO COME TO THE TABLE ABOUT WHAT THIS REPRESENTED. A LOT OF BULLYING. AT A PERSPECTIVE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS CHANGE SERIOUSLY THIS BODY TODAY I HOPE SAYS TAKE THIS CHANGE SERIOUSLY. LOT OF QUESTION WHETHER. THIS BILL GOES FAR ENOUGH IN SETTING THE STANDARD. LEGITIMATE PART OF THE CONVERSATION BUT WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE BILL TODAY BEFORE US AND IT WILL RESONATE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IS THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST ATTEMPTS IS A STATE WIDE LEVEL TO SAY WE NEED TO CHANGE. THE OUTCOMES OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING. IS NO MISTAKE ABOUT THE STATISTICS WHO'S ON THE OTHER END WHEN A POLICE OFFICER PULLED THAT TRIGGER PRIMARILY YOUNG MEN. BLACK AND BROWN. AND UNTIL WE TAKE THE NEXT STEPS AFTER THIS BILL AND BELIEVE ME THIS BILL SETS A STANDARD. BUT OPENS UP THE CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN NEXT WHICH IS WHAT TO OUR POLICE FORCES LOOK WHY. DO THEY LOOK LIKE THE REST OF OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE CURRENTLY THEY DON'T. AND UNLESS WE ENHANCE NOT JUST TRAINING BUT GO BACK INTO THE STANDARDS OF WHO'S ACCEPTABLE TO BE ABLE TO APPLY TO BE A POLICE OFFICER WHO WERE WILLING TO HAVE IN THOSE FORCES THE INTERNAL CULTURES WON'T CHANGE? WE ALSO NEED TO HOLD AND THIS COMES FROM POLICE CHIEFS IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF HOLDING POLICE CHIEFS ACCOUNTABLE. TO THE CULTURE CREATED IN THEIR OWN ORGANIZATION. SO THESE ARE AMONG THE NEXT STEPS THAT ULTIMATELY NEED TO HAPPEN. BUT THAT. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND A WILLINGNESS TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THE STANDARD FOR WHAT'S EXPECTED IN THE USE OF FORCE CONVERSATION THAT MESSAGE WILL RESONATE ACROSS THIS STATE. AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IN A POSITIVE WAY. THAT WILL ENABLE THE NEXT SETS OF CONVERSATIONS TO HAPPEN TO TRULY CHANGE WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE IN OUR COMMUNITIES HOW ARE POLICE FORCES LOOK AT ACT AND BE SENSITIVE. TO THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH THAT'S HOW WE REDUCE THE FEARS. THAT'S HOW WE DO. CHANGE THE BIAS CALCULATION THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN THEIR NUMBER BILLS MOVING THROUGH RIGHT NOW I THINK THEY'RE ALL OFF ON THE SENATE TO ADDRESS THAT THAT BIAS TRAINEE THAT INHERENT BIAS. THAT WE ALL CARRY WHICH IS ONE THING. THE OTHER IS HOW WE ACT ON IT AND THIS BILL SETS A BETTER STAGE FOR ENSURING THAT HOW POLICE FORCES ACT ON THAT BY IS. IS DIFFERENT MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IT WILL SEE A LOT OF CONTROVERSY WHETHER IT'S GONE FAR ENOUGH WHETHER IT'S GONE TOO FAR BUT IS UP TO US TO EMBRACE. WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US? TO BE GRATEFUL TO AN AUTHOR WHO HAS HAD THE PERSISTENCE AND THE PATIENCE TO STAY WITH US AND GUIDE US THROUGH A SET OF CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO BE VERY VERY NECESSARY. AND I WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTH LOS ANGELES FOR SPEAKING HONESTLY ABOUT FEAR AND THAT INTERACTION THAT IS SOMETHING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT PART OF MY EXPERIENCE. SO WITH OUT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTHWEST SANDERS WITHOUT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AND MEMBERS OF THE BLACK CAUCUS LATINO CLOCK IS BEING A PART OF THIS IN THE WOMEN WE HAVE THE LEGISLATURE. WITHOUT THEIR GUIDANCE AND THEIR PERSPECTIVE WE WOULD STILL HAVE A GOOD OLE BOY LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE THAT IS PASSING LAWS THAT DO NOT REPRESENT THE CHANGE THAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS AND I ASKED THAT ALL OF US BE PART OF THE NEXT STEPS OF POLICY THAT NEED TO CHANGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER STONE MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN COMPLETE SUPPORT OF AB THREE NINE TWO I AM. HONORED THAT I AM ABLE TO SIT ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WHERE THIS. FIRST WAS HEARD THIS YEAR -- AND SHARED MY OWN STORY ABOUT BEING TRAUMATIZED -- COMING HOME TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT MY HOUSE ALARM HAD GONE OFF I WAS MET BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO WERE THERE TO REALLY HELP ME BUT ALL OF MY TRAUMA. ALL OF MY FEARS BUBBLED UP DURING MY INTERACTION WITH THEM I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO SIT. WITH DOCTOR WEBER AS MY SEAT MATE TO SEE HER RUMINATE. THIS ENTIRE SESSION ON THIS ONE BILL. AND EVERY DAY HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL AND THE IMPACT THAT IT CAN HAVE ACROSS THE STATE. THE FEARS THE CRIES. THE TESTIMONIES OF ADVOCATES OF VICTIMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE NECESSITY FOR THIS BILL. AND THE REALITY IS [inaudible] YOU NOW. THAT IT IS A GAME CHANGER IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS ASKING US AS THE STATE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FACT THAT SO MANY BLACK AND BROWN ON ARMED MEN. ARE BEING AND HAVE BEEN SHOCKED. AND KILLED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH OUT THEIR CRIES FOR HELP BEING HURT. BUT THE REALITY IS IT'S NOT THAT MUCH OF A GAME CHANGER BECAUSE THE AUTONOMY IT IS STILL LINKED TO THE ECONOMY THAT IS HELD BY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE. AND THEY STILL HOLD THE SAFEGUARDS AS IT RELATES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE NOT GONNA WAKE UP. ON THURSDAY. TO A WHOLE NEW WORLD. BUT HOPEFULLY WE WILL WAKE UP. AND SAY THAT WE HAVE OPEN THE DOOR FOR REAL CONVERSATIONS TO HAPPEN ABOUT HOW OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS PROBABLY OVER WORKED. AND NOT PROPERLY TRAINED AND OVER TRAUMATIZED. HOW ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT NO LONGER HAS THE TRUST OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE ASKED TO PROTECT? AND PROBABLY HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT FEARS FOR THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY GO INTO THOSE VERY SAME COMMUNITIES. THAT FORMULA IS COMBUSTIBLE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT SO MANY BLACK AND BROWN AND POOR COMMUNITIES WANT TO CALL THE POLICE WHEN SOMETHING'S GOING ON THEY'RE LOOKING FOR HELP. BUT THEY'RE AFRAID TO BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THAT CALL TO TURN INTO SOME OTHER CONVERSATION THAT ENDS UP IN THEM BEING ARRESTED OR KILLED. I WANT MY FAMILY TO BE PROTECTED LIKE ANYBODY ELSE'S. I WANT TO MAKE SURE BAD PEOPLE ARE KEPT AT BAY JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE. AND LORD KNOWS I WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BELIEVE IN ME. BECAUSE OF THEY BELIEVE IN ME. THEY WILL PROTECT ME. AND I WILL SEE THAT AND IT WILL RESONATE AND I WILL THEN WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE ARE ALL LIVING IN THAT WE ALL LOVE. ARE SAFE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT VAX. THIS BILL IS THE FIRST STEP IN A NUMBER OF STEPSTHAT DO TALK ABOUT RACE THAT TALK ABOUT CLASS THAT TALK ABOUT BIAS THAT TALK ABOUT FEAR. WE ARE AFRAID WE ARE AFRAID OF EACH OTHER WE ARE AFRAID OF OURSELVES. AND INSTEAD OF TALKING. WE ARE RUNNING FROM [inaudible] OR SHOOTING. AND ALL GOOD PEOPLE [inaudible] LOSE. ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION. WHEN THAT BECOMES THE NORM? SO I AM HOPEFUL THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO GET OFF THIS FLOOR. I AM GLAD THAT THE HEAVY HITTERS HAVE JOINED YOU. AS JOINT CO AUTHORS TO SAY WE AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS REGARDLESS OF HOW WHO THEY LOOK LIKE. REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME OR COLOR OR STATURE. BECAUSE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THEM ALL. SO I THANK YOU FOR KEEPING THIS GOING. AND FOR YOUR TOLERANCE. AND I STAND WITH YOU ALWAYS IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE NINE TWO THANK YOU MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE MS BAUER KAY AND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB -- THREE NINETY TWO ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I HAD THE HONOR OF SITTING NEXT. TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AS WE SAT THERE [inaudible] FOR HOURS. IT'S HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE CAME AND SPOKE. THE USE OF FORCE AND HOW IT AFFECTED THEM OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. HOURS WE STARTED EARLY IN THE MORNING AND IT KEPT GOING PAST LUNCH TIME. AND THE AUTHOR OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO SAT THERE AND LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE. WHO SHE WAS ADVOCATING FOR THAT DAY? AND WE ALSO HEARD FROM A POLICE OFFICER. WHO HAD LOST HER COLLEAGUES IN THE LINE OF FIRE? WELL THEY WERE ON A CALL. AND HOW IT HAD LEFT HER UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO HER JOB. AND I SPOKE THAT DAY OF HOW IT WAS SO CLEAR FROM THE TESTIMONY. THE PENDULUM. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY HAS SWUNG WAY TOO FAR. TO YOU THE ABILITY TO USE FORCE WHEN IT WAS UNNECESSARY. BUT I HAD CONCERNS LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM NICHOLAS THAT THE BILL IS WRITTEN SWUNG THE PENDULUM TOO FAR IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. AND WOULD PUT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN DANGER AS WRITTEN. AND I WANT TO I RISE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. THE ADVOCATES LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERSHIP FOR WORKING TOGETHER TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE REALLY GOOD POLICY THAT WE CAN VOTE ON TODAY. THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THAT WILL STRIKE THAT APPROPRIATE BALANCE. AND THERE IS NO QUESTION TO ME WHEN OUR COMMUNITIES AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES SPOKE TO FEEL SAFE IN RELATIONSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT WE ARE SAFER. WHEN THEY HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE? AND THAT THIS BILL ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO FEEL SAFE IN DOING THEIR JOB AS WELL. AND THAT IS THE BALANCE THAT THIS AUTHOR HAS WORKED SO HARD TO STRIKE AND I THINK DONE SUCH INCREDIBLE JOB OF SO I THINK HER AND I'M PROUD TODAY TO BE STANDING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU MS BAUER CAM MS RACE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I RISE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FROM SAN DIEGO FOR HER HARD WORK. WHILE ALL OF THIS IS GOING IT WAS HAPPENING I HAD A YOUNG. CONSTITUENTS OUR PERMISSION TO USE PROP [inaudible] WITHOUT OBJECTION. THE YOUNG GIRL LEO MY FOURTEEN YEARS OLD FROM ERROR VIEW MIDDLE SCHOOL THE CAME TO SEE ME. TO URGE ME TO VOTE HI. ON THIS BILL. SHE HAD A PIECE OF PAPER. THE NAMES OF VICTIMS. SEVEN CLARK. TWENTY TWO TO MERE RICE. TWELVE ANTOINE ROSE. SEVENTEEN MICHAEL ALTON STERLING. THIRTY SEVEN LOOK QUAN MCDONALD. SEVENTEEN TRAYVON MARTIN. OSCAR GRANT. TWENTY TWO WILLIE MCCOY TWENTY I ANA MODE MONET'S STANLEY JONES. I SPOKE TO OUR GREAT LENGTH. I TOLD HER MOTHER THIS ISN'T WHAT I WANT OUR FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE WRITING NOTES WITH THE NAMES OF ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS. BUT I ALSO TOLD HER MOTHER AND I ALSO TOLD LIAM I HAVE A SISTER WITH THE SET WITH THE SAN BERNARDINO POLICE DEPARTMENT. WHO'S NOW RETIRED. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HER AND HER COLLEAGUES [inaudible] BUT THIS. THIS I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYMORE. I AM SO SO GRATEFUL. TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR WORKING SO SO HARD. BECAUSE SHE KNEW WHAT EVERYBODY OF THE TURMOIL OF ALL OVER COLLEAGUES. AND SHE WORKED HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE END. THROUGH HER PATIENCE PERSISTENCE YOUR PERSEVERANCE. AND HER BELIEF. THE WE WOULD HAVE A SAFER AND BETTER SOCIETY. FOR EVERYONE. I THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I STAND IN SUPPORT WITH MY COLLEAGUE. THEY WITH RESPECT FRAZIER. YOUR ATTENTION THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES -- I RISE TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. AS YOU KNOW WHEN SHE GETS HER TEETH INTO SOMETHING SHE DOES NOT LET GO. SHE'S A PASSIONATE INDIVIDUAL WHO I APPRECIATE SERVING ON THIS FLOOR WITH. MY ISSUE IS THAT THIS BECAME A PARTISAN ISSUE IN THE BEGINNING. AND IT SHOULD NEVER BE. I HAVE RIDDEN WITH EVERY POLICE DEPARTMENT SHERIFF DEPARTMENT AND HIGHWAY PATROL IN MY DISTRICT. ON FULL SHIFT TWELVE HOUR SHIFT RIDE ALONGS. SO I COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT THE POLICE OFFICERS NEEDS WERE. SO WHEN IT CAME TO ME IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. I COULD BE A BETTER LEGISLATOR. I WILL TELL YOU [inaudible] THAT EVERY. POLICE DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA'S UNDERSTAFFED. OUR HIGHWAY PATROL. IS SEVERELY UNDERSTAFFED BUT WE ASK THEM TO DO MORE WITH LESS. AND WE CONTINUE TO ADD LAWS AND AND DUTIES TO THESE DEPARTMENTS. WITHOUT REALIZING THE IMPACT. OF WHAT WE'RE DOING [inaudible] THESE OFFICERS. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALSO? IS THAT WE HAVE QUIRK MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS INTERVENTION RESPONDING. TWO CALLS RATHER THAN OUR POLICE OFFICERS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TRAINED. BUT YET WE EXPECT THEM TO BE THE RESPONDING [inaudible] AGENCY. WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THEM ALSO AND AGAIN. MY SPEAKER. I CAN'T BE MORE PROUD OF ENGAGING ON THIS HUGE ISSUE THE PRO TEM IN THE GOVERNOR. THIS IS THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK WHEN OUR LEADERSHIP REPRESENTS US SO VERY WELL. INTO A SOLUTION THAT EVERYBODY COMES TOGETHER. NOW EVERYBODY NOT MIGHT NOT BE HAPPY. THE COMPROMISES WAS MADE AND IS MADE. ON THEIR EFFORTS. ALL I CAN SAY IS PLEASE WHEN WE LOOK AT WHEN IT COSTS. ADDITIONAL MONIES [inaudible] TO REPRESENT. PUBLIC SAFETY WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION. UNLESS YOU'VE ACTUALLY BEEN AFFECTED. AND BEEN HELPED BY SOMEBODY IN POLICE [inaudible] SERVICE. YOU REALLY DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR VALUE. I DO REMEMBER. THAT ONE ON MY RIGHT ALONG AS MOST OF THE ISSUES WERE CUSTOMER SERVICE RELATED. INSTEAD OF ENFORCEMENT. NOW YOU CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE I WAS IN THE CAR THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE OR THEIR WAY OF DOING BUSINESS. POSSIBLY. BUT THE DAY THAT I WAS WITH THEM I WAS VERY PROUD. THAT THEY DID. THE THINGS THAT THEY DID FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT I REPRESENT. WHAT I WOULD HOPE [inaudible] GOING FORWARD. IS THAT WE CONTINUE. TO WORK TOGETHER WE'VE PUT IN CHARGE OF HELPING AND PROTECTING US UNDERSTANDING [inaudible] THAT. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT JOB. THEY'RE DOING THE JOB. THAT WE SUPPORT THEM ALSO IN THEIR NEEDS. AND THERE ASK I'VE ATTENDED. ALMOST EVERY FUNERAL FOR THE HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS BECAUSE IN MY ROLE AS A CHAIRMAN TRANSPORTATION. I HAVE THE HONOR OF OVERSEEING I WOULD PATROL IN THAT POLICY. THE WINDOWS THAT I'VE I'VE SPOKEN. TO THE FAMILIES THAT I'VE SEEN AFFECTED ALSO. WE HAVE TO LOOK AND UNDERSTAND THIS TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY AND I DON'T I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE EXCUSES. FOR ALL OF THE BAD OCCURRENCES THAT HAVE HAPPENED THAT'S A HUMAN FACTOR. HAPPENS IN EVERY ENTITY IN CALIFORNIA. NOT JUST IN [inaudible] PUBLIC SAFETY. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. BECAUSE OF ALL THE GOOD WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY MY COLLEAGUE. AND LEADERSHIP. AND I'M PROUD THAT THIS WORKED IN THIS FASHION [inaudible] THIS DAY. BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME OUT LIKE THIS. I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THERE WAS FRAZIER MISTER PATTERSON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER AB. MEMBERS [inaudible] I'M. I MUST I MUST SAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES. TO BE A VERY -- PERSONAL AND THE DEEP. AND IN MANY WAYS SORT OF CONFLICTING. A PROCESS IN DECIDING. HOW TO VOTE ON THIS BILL -- MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT MY OLDEST SON BJ'S VIETNAMESE WHEN HE WAS. SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE. AND WAS DRIVING HIS AUTOMOBILE FOR THE FIRST [inaudible] FEW TIMES. WAS PULLED OVER. JOHN DOWN ON BECAUSE HE LOOKED LIKE. A CAR THIEF ANY WAS IN A CAR SIMILAR TO THE CAR THAT WAS STOLEN. AND HE WAS IN THE LOCATION. I REMEMBER SITTING ON THE BED WITH HIM THAT NIGHT. TALKING WITH HIM ABOUT. HOW OFTENTIMES LIFE CAN BE UNFAIR? AND CAN BE SCARY [inaudible] AND THAT. IT WASN'T HIS FAULT [inaudible] THIS WAS. LONG BEFORE I BECAME MAYOR FRESNO. BUT I TOOK IT WITH ME AND CARRIED IT WITH ME. FOR THOSE EIGHT YEARS. AT THE TIME I WAS ELECTED FRESNO HAD ONE OF THE LOCK THE SMALLEST A PER CAPITA POLICE FORCES. IN THE UNITED STATES FRANKLY. WE HAD A HUNDRED HOMICIDES IN ONE YEAR. FIFTEEN THOUSAND CARS BEING STOLEN THESE WERE DIFFICULT TIMES [inaudible] WE MADE [inaudible] THE DECISION AND TO DOUBLE THAT POLICE FORCE. BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO GET. IT ANOTHER OFFICERS SO THAT WE COULD BE PROACTIVE RATHER THAN REACTIVE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. FRESNO HAS A STRONG MAYOR FORM OF GOVERNMENT. FOR THE BUCK STOPS ON MY DESK. YOU HIRE THE POLICE CHIEF AND YOU LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE OFFICER'S BIOGRAPHY AND YOU INTERVIEW THEM. I DID THAT OVER AND OVER. AND OVER AGAIN. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THESE POLICE OFFICERS. WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR DECISION? TO BE A POLICE OFFICER. THESE ARE SOME OF THE BEST HUMAN BEINGS YOU CAN POSSIBLY FIND. AND THERE. BIOGRAPHIES ARE RIFE WITH. BEING IN THE MILITARY OR MILITARY POLICE ARE BEING AND ANOTHER POLICE DEPARTMENT AND AND ALL OF THAT. AND WE ENDED UP [inaudible] HIRING AND CRIME WENT DOWN. AND COMMUNITIES THAT WERE AFRAID. OF THE FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAME. ALLIES. IT WASN'T EASY. BUT IT WAS BECAUSE WE DID HAVE THE RESPECT. OF THE COMMUNITY AND WE HAD A POLICE DEPARTMENT. THAT WAS LED BY A SUCCESSION OF CHIEFS THAT INSTILLED IN THEM. THE NECESSITY TO USE THAT FORCE WITH WISDOM. AND SO I RISE WITH. A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF EXPERIENCE [inaudible] WHEN IT? COMES TO THE ONE OR TWO TIMES. WHEN A POLICE OFFICER? HAD TO USE DEADLY FORCE. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT A TROUBLED THAT POLICE OFFICER OF A BIT IS A TROUBLED ANYBODY ELSE AND AND TROUBLED ME. BUT WHERE I AM CONFUSED HERE. IS THAT I AM TRYING TO SEE. WHAT IS IT IN THIS BILL? THAT IS SUCH A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM THE STATUS QUO. THAT IT BECOMES A GAME CHANGER. FOR MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT THE STANDARD HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND THE PRACTICE HAS ALWAYS BEEN. THAT WE THAT THERE WOULD BE A A REASONABLE. A REASONABLE PASSED REASONABLENESS. THAT THERE THAT THERE WOULD BE A NECESSITY. AND THAT WHEN IT WAS PUT TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THE PROCESS IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE LOOK AT THE TOTALITARIAN. TO COUNTY. OF THE PARTICULAR INCIDENT. THIRTY SECONDS MISS PATTERSON AND SO I TO ME I LOOK AT THE BILL AND I HEAR. GAME CHANGER I HEAR. THIS CHART SO HOLD NEW COURSE. AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW THAT ACTUALLY IS IN? BODY IN THE BILL. FOR IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE IS A STANDARD A NECESSITY. THERE IS A STANDARD OF OF REASONABLE LESS. AND THAT CONTINUING TO PLACE THIS IN THE HANDS. OUR FOR THE KIND OF JUDITH ADJUDICATION OF A WHETHER IT'S A A A A A A BAD. SHOOTING RECORD OR NOT. REST WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHICH MEANS TO ME THAT THERE IS THIS. PROCESS THAT LOOKS AT THE TOTALITY OF OF THE INCIDENT AND SO. I FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH -- I'D LIKE I'D LIKE. TO DRAFT ACT ASK THE AUTHOR MAYBE OTHERS COULD COULD COMMENT. ON HOW. WHY IS THIS BILL SUCH A? DEEP SEA CHANGE. BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE OUTLINE OF THE BILL AS I UNDERSTAND IT. A STE ESSENTIALLY KEEPS. THE REASONABLE STANDARD AND AND THE THE SESAME STANDARD. ARE. ALSO SUGGESTED THERE NEEDS TO BE A TOTALITARIAN TOTALITY OF THE INFORMATION -- THAT TENDS TO BE THE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE AT LEAST OF THE FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT IN LOOKING AT THOSE. KINDS OF SHOES AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN OUR AREA TIME IS SO FAST SO FOR THOSE REASONS I PERHAPS CENTER AT HER CLOTHES OR SOMEBODY. SOMETIME OTHERS COULD COULD COULD MENTION. WHAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE HERE THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON DOCTOR EGGMAN. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. BUT THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AND ANNA PERHAPS ONE OF THE ANSWERS TO THE SEA CHANGE IS THE COURT VERY CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING -- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN LACKING OVER. THE LAST THE LAST SEVEN YEARS I WOULD SAY ME PERHAPS -- WE CONTINUE TO SEE OF A RISE AND POLICE INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE A RISE I THINK IN IN -- OVERALL VIOLENCE AND THESE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE THE VIDEOS THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE THESE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND CONTINUE TO TAKE SIDES. AND I THINK THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF NOT STAYING AND TAKING SIDES BUT COMING TOGETHER. COMING TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I AM A WE WERE DONE -- I'M MUST SOCIAL WORKER RIGHT SO I HAVE BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF ISSUES AROUND SOCIAL JUSTICE MY ENTIRE LIFE. I HESITATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS BILL AND ONE ALSO THANK MY COLLEAGUE. WHO I AM HONORED TO SHARE A FLOOR WITH? TO PLEASE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET A COMPROMISE. BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT A POLICY. WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND TO COME TO AGREEMENTS WERE PERHAPS NOT EVERYBODY IS HAPPY. BUT THE PUBLIC GREATER GOOD IS SERVED. AND ISN'T THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY ALL HERE. FOR BECAUSE I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK. DOES JUST AN AVERAGE CITIZEN. ONE OF MY CITIES EVEN IF YOU DON'T IF YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU'RE ALL UP HERE DURING A MAJORITY THE WEEKEND SO YOUR IN MY MY NEWS CHANNELS. AND SO YOU KNOW I REPRESENT THE CITY OF STOCKTON. AND YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION AT ALL YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A SPIKE IN CRIME. LIKE WE HAVEN'T HAD IN QUITE AWHILE. TEXTING WITH MY CHIEF SINCE MONTH SINCE -- OVER THE WEEKEND WITH THREE MURDERS. ONE OF THEM ON I FIVE ALL OF THESE ARE BY SHOOTINGS. I CAN'T COUNT THE AMOUNT OF SHOOTINGS ARE PROBABLY HAD OVER THIRTY GUN RELATED SHOOTINGS. WHO HAD AT LEAST SEVEN MURDERS SINCE THE BEGINNING? OF THIS OF THIS MONTH ONLY. SO WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE ISSUES AROUND VIOLENCE AND AS A AND LAST NIGHT WAS TRUST NOT MY HOUSE WHERE THE TRASH ON THE AND EVERY TIME WE HEARD A NOISE MY LOOK GIRLY WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THAT. BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO LIVING IN A HEIGHTENED AREA FEAR WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE'S VIOLENCE OCCURRING AROUND US. AND IF SOMETHING HAPPENS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. WE CALL. GOING TO BE SAFE AND THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE GOING TO BE. HESITATING WHEN THEY COME. BUT WE KNOW. THAT IN ORDER TO GET TO THOSE PLACES WE NEED THE TRAINING WE TALK ABOUT IMPLICIT BIAS WE TALK ABOUT ALL THOSE THINGS THAT EXIST. AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE TRAINING HAS TO BE THERE SO THEY CAN DO THEIR JOB TO THE UP MOST OF THEIR ABILITIES AND US HAVING THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS. ENSURE THAT THOSE PRECAUTIONS. CAN OCCUR OFFICERS ARE SAFE. INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE KILLED ON THE STREETS. AND THE PUBLIC STILL HAS THE TRUST. THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKED AFTER. TO I THINK THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CONCERN OURSELVES WITH AND WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT. THAT WE ARE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS. ALSO WE TALK ABOUT FUNDING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SHOULD BE ON THE FRONTLINE WE'RE GOING OUT TO DEAL WITH AND BUT ONE PERSON WHO IS MENTALLY ILL I THINK THIS LAST WEEK THAT WAS SHOT. WAS. IN VERY AGGRESSIVE. I DON'T KNOW WHO WENT OUT ON THOSE BUT I MEAN WE NEED TO WORK MUCH CLOSER WITH US SO. I RISE IN SUPPORT. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I WANT TO THANK ALL SIDES TO BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER ON THIS AND I WAS WE GO FORWARD AS LEADERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVING THESE COURAGEOUS CONVERSATIONS WE MAKE SURE THAT ALL VOICES IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE REPRESENTED. I STRONGLY SUPPORT AB THREE NINETY TWO AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP. PATIENTS HER TENACITY. HER WISDOM AND EVERYBODY ELSE FOR COMING TO THE TABLE THAT SHE SET AND INVITED THEM. TO THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN MS WICKS [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER SPEAKER -- FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I'M A FRESHMAN HERE AND I HAD THE HONOR OF WATCHING DOCTOR WEBER WORK THIS BILL -- AND WATCHING HER COMMITMENT TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND TO THIS ISSUE WHICH IS NOT AN EASY ISSUE TO DEAL WITH AND SHE'S REALLY TACKLE THAT AND SO. I LEARNED A LOT FROM HER IN THIS PROCESS AND WANT TO THANK HER FOR THAT. YOU KNOW I TO SIT ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AND I ASKED TO BE ON THAT COMMITTEE BECAUSE I WANTED. TO BE IN THE THE THICK OF THESE TOUGH ISSUES AND I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT WE NEED CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IN THE STATE AND THAT WE CAN LEAD THE WAY IN THIS COUNTRY ON THOSE ISSUES. AND I SAT IN THAT COMMITTEE HEARING -- AS MUCH AS MIGHT NEIGHBORING COLLEAGUE HAD MENTIONED. AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE MOTHERS WHO HAD LOST THEIR CHILDREN. AT THE HANDS OF GUN VIOLENCE FROM POLICE. AND THEY HELP THOSE PHOTOS UP. AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY MOVING TO SEE. AND VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE. AND I THINK WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT STRIKES AT THE HEART. AND TRIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS. THAT WE SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE TRUTH THAT. BROWN AND BLACK MEN PRIMARILY ARE THE ONES WHO WERE KILLED AT THE HANDS THE HANDS OF POLICE. PEOPLE WITH MY SKIN COLOR. OR NOT. THAT'S THE TRUTH. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AT THE HANDS OF POLICE. LESS THAN HALF OF THEM WERE ARMED. AND OF THOSE THAT WERE KILLED WHO WERE UNARMED. 75% WERE PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND I THINK WITH THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BOTH BELIEVE. WE CAN HOLD IN IN OUR HEARTS THE IDEA THAT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICE ARE TRYING TO DO A GOOD JOB. AND THEY ARE BROTHERS AND OUR SISTERS AND OUR MOTHERS AND OUR FATHERS. AND OUR CHILDREN. THEY ARE TRYING TO DO A GOOD JOB. THEY'RE ALSO. EXPERIENCING TRAUMA AND STRESS. AND DON'T ALL OF THEM HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO THE GOOD JOB THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO. AND WE DO KNOW THAT MISTAKES ARE MADE. AND ALSO THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS THAT I THINK THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS. AND I THINK THE WAY THAT WE REBUILD TRUST IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT GOOD POLICING IS BASED ON THE WAY WE DO THAT IS WE HAVE MORE COMMUNITY POLICING WE HAD IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING. WE HAVE DE ESCALATION TRAINING AND WE HAVE THE LEGAL TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX. TO HOLD FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THESE TRAGIC MISTAKES HAPPEN. I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS WORK I PROBABLY VOTE FOR THIS BILL. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO GIVE US AN IPHONE. THANK YOU WAS WITH MISTER RIGHT. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED [inaudible] MEMBERS. I WENT TO BED [inaudible] OUR CHRISTMAS. NIGHT THIS PAST YEAR IN MY HOME TOWN OVER SAID. HAVING SPENT THE DAY WITH MY FAMILY. AND I WOKE UP. ON DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH. TO READ ABOUT A THE THIRTY THREE YEAR OLD MAN. THE WIFE AND YOUNG CHILD. FIVE MONTHS OLD. GUN DOWN. IN MY COMMUNITY. HE WAS GUNNED DOWN [inaudible] PATROLLING. THE STREETS OF THE WEST SIDE MERCED COUNTY. AS A YOUNG OFFICER. PULLING SOMEONE OVER ON A DEAL I STOCK. ANOTHER YOUNG MAN IT STOPPED AT A CONVENIENCE STORE WAS INTOXICATED THE CONVENIENCE STORE CAR OWNER CALLED AND THIS OFFICER PULLED THAT YOUNG MAN OVER AND WAS SHOT AND KILLED. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPERIENCED. LOSS OF OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR DISTRICTS. ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT COIN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH BRIGHT FUTURES MISTAKENLY GONE DOWN. LIVES LOST. TRAGIC. THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHY RISE. THE COMMAND THE AFTER. THAT THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR LEADERSHIP NOT JUST IN THIS BILL. LEADERSHIP IN OUR COMMUNITY HERE ON THE FLOOR [inaudible] MY CALLING FROM FRESNO RAISE THE ISSUE WHAT'S DIFFERENT TODAY. THEN THE STATUS QUO HOW ARE WE MOVING THE ISSUE FORWARD. AND I WOULD SAY I'M STRUCK. BY THE SUPPORT ON THIS FOR THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. SUPPORT FROM ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT TRAGEDIES. DIFFERENT SIDES OF THIS DIFFICULT STICKY ISSUE WITH A LOT OF EMOTION. AND TOO OFTEN. IN OUR POLITICS [inaudible] OF TODAY. IT'S EASY TO RETREAT. BACK INTO VILIFIED THE OTHER SIDE. TAP POLITICAL POSTURING RHETORIC. THAT SOME OF THAT RHETORIC HELPS MANY OF US IN OUR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS ON THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT. WHAT'S HARD IS SITTING DOWN. AND RECOGNIZING THE HUMANITY ON ALL SIDES AND BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO DO AND IT'S MADE MORE DIFFICULT. BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SUCH A DIVISIVE POLITICS IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. WE GET A LACK DIDN'T COME UP TO SACRAMENTO WE IMMEDIATELY DIVIDE OURSELVES INTO PARTY'S. AND THEN WE DIVIDE OURSELVES FURTHER [inaudible] MEANWHILE. CONSTITUENTS IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS FOR PROBLEM SOLVERS AND DOCTOR WEBER. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. COMES FROM A A PLACE WHERE. SHE COULD EASILY [inaudible] RETREAT [inaudible] IN [inaudible] TWO RHETORIC [inaudible] AND PARTISANSHIP. BUT SHE CHOSE NOT TO THIS ISSUE IS TOO IMPORTANT. SHE SPENT THE TIME AND I HAD WEEKLY CONVERSATIONS ON THIS SENSITIVE ISSUE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN MY DISTRICT AND YOU CAN IMAGINE. WITH THIS YOUNG MAN GOT DOWN JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO THE SENSITIVITY. WITH THOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE CONSISTENT DRUM BEAT. OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANDY -- PUSHING THE ISSUE FORWARD TOGETHER BRING EVERYONE ALONG. CHANGING MINDS EVOLVING THINKING. MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES MENTIONED FEAR DIVISION TRUST. WHAT PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS WE'RE BUILDING TRUSTS? WHERE THE LEADERS MEMBERS WERE HERE TO REPRESENT? OUR COMMUNITIES AND HOW WE CONDUCT OUR POLITICS. BUILDS TRUST. TEARS DOWN DIVISIONS. MAKES THINGS LIKE THIS BILL POSSIBLE TODAY. COMMUNITIES ARE SAFEST WHEN THAT TRUST EXIST. BETWEEN THOSE THAT PROTECT US. AND THOSE THAT THEY PROTECT. AND I THINK TODAY MEMBERS WITH THIS BILL. WITH THE SUPPORT. WE'VE MOVE THAT FORWARD AND I WOULD URGE AND I THOUGHT. THANK YOU MISS GRAY MISTER GIBSON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS [inaudible] I STRUGGLE. WITH THIS BILL [inaudible] I TOILED. WITH THIS BILL. AS A FORMER POLICE OFFICER. AS A BLACK MAN. AS A BLACK MAN HAS [inaudible] TO YOUNG SONS [inaudible] I STRUGGLE. WITH THIS BILL. BEING IN THIS POSITION. AT THE STATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL. WHO PARTNER WAS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY? AS A POLICE OFFICER I STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL. WITHIN A YOUNG MAN AT FIFTEEN YEARS OLD DIE IN MY ARMS WHILE ON PATROL I STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL. MAKING SURE THAT I GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. I'M NOT PLAYING WITH THIS. MY TEAM BOTH THE CAPITAL AND THE DISTRICT TEAM WENT HOURS AND HOURSDISSECTING THIS BILL. ASKING QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR AN AUTHOR STAFF. BECAUSE WE GOT TO GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME. THIS LAW HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED SINCE. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AND NOW WE'RE TAKING ALL THIS GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. TO MAKE A CHANGE. BUT I CAN'T DO NOT DENY. AS A BLACK MAN [inaudible] THE INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE DYING IN OUR STREETS? I COULD NOT DENY. THE YOUNG MEN. WHO ARE NOT ONLY BEING KILLED BY POLICE OFFICERS BUT ALSO BEING KILLED BY? BUT GETTING MEMBERS AS WELL. I CAN'T DENY THAT. THOSE ARE REAL. VIVID IMAGES IN MY MIND. AS A PARENT. AS A PAIR MAKING SURE THE CHILD GETS HOME ON TIME. UNDERSTANDING MAKING SURE THAT WHOEVER MY SON GETS IN THE CAR WITH. YOU TAKE CARE OF YOU TAKE A PICTURE THE LICENSE PLATES AND SEND IT TO ME. MAKING SURE THAT DO NOT A HOME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK YEAH BUT I WANNA KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED I DON'T WANT TO BURY NOT ANOTHER CHILD BECAUSE I HAD A BETTER. ONE BUT I'LL BE IF I'M GOING TO BEAR ANOTHER. ONE SO I HAD TO GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME. SO I LISTEN TO ALL OF YOU WHICH COMMENTARIES AND AND WHEN WORDS BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE MY KIND OF EXPERIENCE. THE GREW UP POOR I GREW UP. AND I WORE THE UNIFORM. I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE THE SERVER PROTECT MY COMMUNITY. AND I DID IT. SO THOSE OF YOU WORE UNIFORMS. WHATEVER REASON BUT YOU'RE NOT SAYING ANYTHING THAT'S ON YOU. BUT I'M GOING TO SAID NOR DOES SERVE AS LONG AS YOU IN UNIFORM. I DIDN'T STUDENT TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF THIRTY SEVEN THE THIRTY YEARS THAT SO MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS FLOOR START TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT I TOOK THAT RESPONSIBILITY EVERY MAN AND WOMAN THAT WEAR A BADGE AND A AND PUT ON A UNIFORM WITH A CLOSE THAT LOCKER ROOM DOOR. THAT MAY BE THE LAST TIME. WHEN I KISSED A WISER CHILDREN THAT MAY BE VERY WELL THERE LAST TIME? THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I GET A RIGHT SO I GREW THE AUTHOR. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME MY SON THE BOND AND JORDAN AND ALL THE OTHER KIDS THAT ARE CALLED MY SON'S. WHETHER NO MY DNA IS MATCHING THERE'S A NOT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER NOT I KNOW THEIR NAMES MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME THEY'RE ALL MY CHILDREN I KNOW MY BROTHER'S KEEPER. AND SO WHEN WE TAKE THIS BUSINESS REPORTS TODAY. WE HAVE TO TAKE IT SOBERLY I THOUGHT [inaudible] IN MINE. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGING SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED SINCE. EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SO I WANT. TO SIMPLY SAY THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DONE HER DUE DILIGENCE. SHE PUT THE TIME IN. SHE HAS STILL OF THE COURSE. THE WHITE OUR STATE ON HER SHOULDERS. BUT SHE HAS BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER WHO WOULD NOT TALK BEFORE. BROKERED A COMPROMISE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. BUT I BELIEVE THAT OUR WORK IS NOT FINISHED YET. AND I THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE LAWN FORCED WAS PROTECTED. BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR YOUNG MEN. IN MY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE PROTECTED AS WELL. THAT'S ALL I WANNA THANK THIS AUTHOR FOR STANDING UP DOING SOMETHING VERY COURAGEOUS. BY BRINGING THIS CONVERSATION SO THIS FLOOR AND SO I COMMEND YOU. BUT WE CANNOT ALSO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THREE NINETY TWO WITH ALL TALKING ABOUT SB TWO THIRTY AS WELL. BECAUSE TO THIRTY IS VERY IMPORTANT IT TALKS ABOUT THE TRAINING THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THIS NEXT GENERATION OF POLICE OFFICERS YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. THIRTY SECONDS GIPSON. SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. BUT ALSO BE ASKING MY COLLEAGUES THOSE WHO CO AUTHORED THIS BILL. SO ALSO SUPPORT. TO THIRTY BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. NO I RESPECTFULLY ASK BUT I VOTE AND TAKE THIS AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BEFORE US TODAY. THANK YOU MS GIBSON [inaudible] MR LACKEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I WAS GOING TO SPEAK. BUT I FELT LIKE. THEY'LL BE A BETRAYAL TO THIS ISSUE. IN MY ENTIRE ELECTED EXPERIENCE. NEVER HAS A BILL. CONSUMED MY THINKING AS THIS HOUSE. AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF MY LIFE EXPERIENCE. BEING DIFFERENT THAN MOST IN THIS BODY AS IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE. WE TALK ABOUT. CHANGES THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE IN ORDER TO BRING. RESOLUTION TO A VERY DIFFICULT MATTER. AND WE TALK ABOUT. THE KINDS OF CHANGES NEED TO TAKE PLACE. WITHOUT HAVING A BALANCED VIEW OF OF THE CHANGE NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. COLLEAGUES I WOULD TELL YOU THAT WE NEED A CULTURE CHANGE. AND PART OF THAT CHANGE THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE IS THE COMMUNICATION. BECAUSE WE HAVE BECOME SO POLARIZED IN OUR THINKING AND THERE'S SO MUCH ANGER AND SO MUCH EMOTION. THAT HAS FILLED OUR HEARTS. AND A LOT BECAUSE OF MISUNDERSTANDING A LOT BECAUSE OUR CULTURE HAS. CHOSEN A PATHWAY THAT IDENTIFIES AND DIFFERENCES INSTEAD OF COMMONALITIES WE ARE THE UNITED STATES. AND WE NEED TO BECOME UNITED CULTURE WE NEED TO BECOME UNITED STATE. AND MORE TO THIS ISSUE. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT MY BIGGEST CONCERN. IS NOT THAT WE HAVE NOT. HAD UNNECESSARY VICTIMS BUT THE WE DIDN'T TURN THE TABLE. AND MAKE LAW ENFORCEMENT UNNECESSARY VICTIMS. BECAUSE IT'S MY OPINION THAT AT ONE STAGE OF THIS BILL WE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT. BUT I WON ALSO THANK SOMEBODY. THAT I DON'T OFTEN THANK AND THAT IS OUR GOVERNOR. FOR TO TAKING A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS MATTER. AND FOR HAVING A VERY POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON REACHING WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY. I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU ONE DESERVED STORY. AND ONE REASON WHY I AM SO EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED. TO THIS ISSUE. YOU SEE. DEADLY FORCE IS SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW. PEOPLE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND. AND I HOPE THAT YOU NEVER HAVE TO UNDERSTAND [inaudible] BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGREES TO PUT THEMSELVES IN THESE UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. AND WHEN THEY HAPPENED THEY HAPPENED SO FAST. AND THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE ARE SO QUICK. THE VERY FEW CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS. BECAUSE IT HAPPENED SO FAST THAT YOU DON'T THINK. YOU REACT. AND YOU RELY UPON. THE PIVOTAL PIECE OF WHAT WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON AND THAT IS TRAINING. BECAUSE MOST OFFICERS A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OFFICERS EVER FACED THIS. AND THAT'S SOMETHING MAYBE. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. AS DEADLY FORCE IS RARELY CALL UPON. BUT WHEN IT IS IT IS THE MOST CRITICAL THING THAT CAN HAPPEN IN ONE'S LIFE. BOTH FOR THE OFFICER. AS WELL AS THE PERPETRATOR THE PERSON THAT'S THE OTHER HALF OF THE EQUATION. AND I HAVE TO SHARE WITH YOU. THE OFFICERS DON'T GO OUT WITH. WITH. A PERSPECTIVE A PREDATION WE'RE NOT PREDATORS SPOKES AND WHEN I SAY WE HAVE NO LONGER AN OFFICER BUT WHEN I WAS AN OFFICER THAT WAS FURTHER STATE FOR OUR MIND. WE ARE WILLING TO DIE FOR PEOPLE WE'VE NEVER MET. AND THAT'S THE COMMITMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE VALIDATED AND NEEDS TO BE COMMUNICATED AND NEEDS TO BE [inaudible] DISCUSSED. BECAUSE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN SOMEONE WHO IS A VERY BIG PART OF MY LIFE. HAD TO USE DEADLY FORCE. HE WAS SHOT DURING THE ENCOUNTER. BUT FROM THAT DAY HE WAS NEVER THE SAME INDIVIDUAL. BECAUSE HE HAD TO USE. THE FORCE HE WAS TRAINED TO USE AND THAT THAT DECISION AND THAT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE CALLED UPON. BUT HE WAS NEVER ABLE TO ADAPT. TO THAT. CHALLENGE AND HE ENGAGED IN SOME DESTRUCTIVE. COPING MECHANISMS TO THE POINT TO WHERE HE ENDED UP TAKING HIS OWN LIFE. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER EVERYONE. I'M THANKFUL THERE I THINK WE'VE COME AT AND THIS BILL STILL HAS SOME THINGS TO TROUBLE ME. BUT IT'S WHAT HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER WE NEED TO BE. TO HAVE BALANCE AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S BRINGING US TOGETHER AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL DOES THAT AND SO WILL OR MY SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY MISTER RODRIGUEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES MEMBERS. AS YOU KNOW IT THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT BILL FOR ME TO TO DISCUSS. BECAUSE I'M A PARENT OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER I THINK MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE. TALKED TO MY SON BEFORE AS HE VISITS HERE AT THE CAPITOL FROM TIME TO TIME. AND BEING BACK IN MY DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF POMONA. THE LAST THREE YEARS THERE'S BEEN TWO OFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY [inaudible] AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO. TO BRING THIS BILL FORWARD TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. BUT TO CONTINUE HAVING THAT DISCUSSION AS THIS BILL LOOKS TO MOVE FORWARD -- WE TALK ABOUT THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS AND AND ALL THAT HAVE DIED WHETHER IT'S STEP ON CLARK. OR NELLY CORONA -- ONE LIFE THAT WE LOSE IS ONE TO MANY. AT OF THE TALK ABOUT PERRANCE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE NOT ONLY AS A LAWMAKER BUT COMING UP TO SACRAMENTO EVERY WEEK. LOOKING OUT MY SON BEFORE HE GOES TO WORK. AND I WONDER AT TIMES I HOPE THIS IS NOT THE LAST TIME I SEE MY SON. AS I COME TO SACRAMENTO. BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO GET THAT PHONE CALL WHILE I'M UP HERE. THE MY SON HAS DIED IN THE LINE OF DUTY I THINK OF WHEN MY COLLEAGUES TALKED ABOUT. PUTTING THEIR LIFE. ON THE LINE TO PROTECT US AND I SEE MY SON DOING THAT AS WELL. THAT HE WOULD GIVE HIS LIFE TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THAT HE SERVES. NOT ONLY HIM BUT ALL THE OF OFFICERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- SO WITHOUT SAID. I JUST HOPE THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE DIALOGUE WITH BOTH SIDES. BECAUSE MY SON LIVES MATTERS AS WELL AND I HOPE TO GOD AND PRAY. THAT NO ONE ELSE DIES. ESPECIALLY THAT I NEVER GET THAT PHONE CALL THE TELLS ME THAT MY SON WAS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER RODRIGUEZ THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR A THOUGHTFUL THOUGHTFUL DEBATE. SEE NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MISTER SPEAKER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THREE NINETY TWO AND WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL AND AND DISCUSS IT AT THAT TOUCHING. COMMENTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST FORTY FIVE MINUTES. FAMOUS SAYING TELLS US THAT JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. BUT WE COULD JUST AS ACCURATELY SAY THAT ANY PERPETUATION OF INJUSTICE. LASTS TOO LONG. FOR DECADES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE SUFFERED INSTANCES OF INJUSTICE WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH THE VERY PEOPLE CHARGED WITH PROTECTING THEIR SAFETY. NOW THE CAMERAS ARE UBIQUITOUS. EVERYONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE ON JUST TAX. THE TIME TO DO SOMETHING IS OVERDUE. THE TIME TO DO SOMETHING IS TODAY. THE POLICY ON USE OF FORCE IN CALIFORNIA WAS WRITTEN IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AND IT NO LONGER SERVES ITS PURPOSE. I WANT TO JOIN THE CHORUS IN THANK YOU THE MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO FOR ONCE AGAIN. ALLOCATING THE ISSUE OF JUSTICE. AND WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT HER PERSISTENCE HAS BROUGHT THIS TO THE FLOOR TODAY. TODAY CALIFORNIA HAS THE CHANCE AS IN SO MANY OTHER POLICY AREAS TO SET AND NATION LEADING STANDARD. WE SHOULD NOT MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAND ON THE SIDE OF TRUE JUSTICE. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB. THREE NINETY TWO THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. DOCTOR WEBER FIVE MINUTES ON THE CLOTHES. THANK YOU -- MISTER SPEAKER AND AND TO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU. FOR TOLERATING ME OVER THE LAST YEAR. IN TERMS OF WORKING ON BUT I AM -- THREE ONE AS WELL AS THREE NINE TWO AND LISTENING TO ME YEAH I GOT A CHANCE TO VISIT MANY PLACES I HADN'T BEEN BEFORE WHICH IS SOME OF YOUR OFFICES -- AND TO SIT WITH YOU. AND HOPEFULLY HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WAS IMPORTANT. IT IS OBVIOUS TO SO MANY PEOPLE THAT THE CURRENT REASONABLE STANDARD. FOR USING FORCE AND SPECIFICALLY DEADLY FORCE SET FORTH IN CALIFORNIA'S AW. AND US CONSTITUTION DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE OR PROTECT PEOPLE'S FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS. THAT IS WHY COMMUNITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE RECOGNIZE THAT THEY NEED TO HOLD THEMSELVES TO A HIGHER STANDARD. UPDATING THEIR USE OF FORCE POLICIES TO ADOPT BEST PRACTICES LIKE REQUIRING DE ESCALATION WHEN FEASIBLE USING FORCE WHEN IT IN PROPORTION TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OBJECTIVE. AND GROUNDING THEIR POLICIES IN THE SAME TO T. OF LIFE. THE AUTHORIZING PEACE OFFICERS TO USE DEADLY FORCE ONLY WHEN NECESSARY TO DEFEND AGAINST AN IMMINENT THREAT OF DEATH OF SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. AND CONSIDERING THE ACTIONS OF OFFICES LEADING UP TO USE OF FORCE AB. THREE NINE TO BRING CALIFORNIA UP TO THAT HIGHER STANDARD. LAW ENFORCEMENT AS SOMEONE MENTIONED EXPRESSED EARLIER THAT WE BE FOCUSING ON AYE HINDSIGHT TWENTY TWENTY VISION IN TERMS OF WE DID THAT COULD. MAKING THEM. BASICALLY SECOND GUESS THEMSELVES. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS CHANGED ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE BECAUSE THAT WAS NEVER THE INTENT. YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS ASKED TO TAKE THIS BILL -- WITH ALL OF THE SPONSORS AND THE PEOPLE BEHIND IT. I TOOK IT WOULD GREAT GREAT CONCERN. BECAUSE MOST OF YOU KNOW I'M AN EDUCATOR AND I CAME OVER TO DO EDUCATION STUFF. AND YET I'VE DONE A LOT OF SOCIAL JUSTICE WORK AND I GUESS THAT'S A PART OF IT AS WELL. BECAUSE OF OF MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF OF ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR THOSE WHO ARE BEING LEFT OUT AND BEEN IGNORED IN THE SYSTEM. AND SO WHEN I WAS ASKED TO TAKE THIS BILL. I LOOKED AT IT AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. DIDN'T SEEM VERY COMPLICATED TO ME. SIMPLE SAYING YOU DON'T TAKE LIFE UNLESS IT'S NECESSARY WHICH SOUNDS TO BE WHAT MOST OF US THINK IS THE NORMAL PRACTICE. BUT AS MANY THINGS THAT I REALIZE ABOUT TO BE DEFERRED DIFFICULT. I REALIZE IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN THAT WE HAVE MADE CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY NOT JUST BECAUSE OF OUR WORDS AND OUR ACTIONS. BUT BECAUSE OF OUR SPIRIT. AND SO I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO MY CHURCH. AND I ASKED THEM AND TOLD THEM WHAT THAT I WAS BEING ASKED TO DO SOMETHING REALLY DIFFICULT. THE KIND OF EXPLAINED IT TO ME A LITTLE BIT. AND I SAID I WANT YOU TO PRAY FOR ME. SO THAT I CAN MAKE A GOOD DECISION AS TO WHETHER NOT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD DO. IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE NEXT WEEK MANY OF THEM CAME TO ME AND SAY THAT. WE'RE PRAYING. THAT YOU WILL DO IT. WE ARE PRAYING THAT YOU WILL DO THIS. THEY SAID BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AROUND WHAT IS AVAILABLE YOU PROBABLY HAVE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF STRENGTH AND PERSEVERANCE. THEN ANYBODY ELSE THAT WE KNOW. THAT YOU ALWAYS FIGHT THESE BATTLES AND YOU HANG IN THERE AND YOU DON'T GET WORRIED. AND SO I'VE HAD TO GO TO THE MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST YEAR. TO SAY PRAY FOR ME. HOLD ME UP BECAUSE THIS IS DIFFICULT. AND IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE IS THE HARDEST THING THAT I HAVE DONE ON THIS FLOOR IN TERMS OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL. BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS SO VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND I DIDN'T WANT TO PERSONALIZE I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE IT ABOUT ME I WANT TO MAKE IT ABOUT THE ISSUES. AND I WANTED TO BE AWARE OF ALL THE PIECES THAT WERE PART OF IT AND SO I THINK THOSE WHO HELPED WRITE THIS BILL. I THANK THOSE FAMILIES WHO WHO BELIEVED IN ME ENOUGH TO IN TRUST ME. TO MAKE A CHANGE FOR THEM IN THERE AND THAT THEIR CHILDREN. AND I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT THE DEEP AND PROFOUND HER THAT SO MANY OF THEM FEEL. THAT IS YEARS AND YEARS OLD THE FEELING THAT THEY DIDN'T GET. THEY WERE AT HER THEY DIDN'T HAVE JUSTICE AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND THAT WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME. SO I THANK HIM FOR IN TRUSTING ME TO CARRY THIS FOR THEM. I ALSO THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THEIR OPPOSITION. BECAUSE THEIR OPPOSITION HELPED ME TO UNDERSTAND THE DEPTH OF THEIR CONCERN. AND HELP ME ALSO TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THIS HAD TO BE A BILL THAT HAD SOME BALANCE. AND I KEPT SAYING THAT THIS BILL WILL MAKE IT SAFE BEHIND AND IN FRONT OF THE BAD. BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT THIS IS NOT A AS SOME OF THE EARLIEST I SAID THIS WAS NOT ABOUT TO GET TO BE ILL. I DON'T WANT TO CATCH FOLKS I WANT TO PREVENT THE ACTIONS AND ONE IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS IN COMMUNITIES WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT MY COMMUNITY DESERVES TO HAVE THE LUXURY. OF CALLING THE POLICE AND KNOWING THAT LIFE GETS BETTER AS A RESULT OF THEM COMING. BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T FEEL THAT THEN THEY WILL NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. AS I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO STOOD WITH ME EARLY IN THE GAME WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WITH. NINE THREE ONE AND THOSE WHO HUNG IN HERE THIS TIME. THE HUNDREDS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN THE FAMILIES WHO SHARED AND CARE AND WILL WILLING ALSO TO SOMETIMES SUSPEND THEIR PERSONAL DESIRES FOR US TO REACH A CONCLUSION. THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM. BECAUSE THEY WANT CHANGE. THEY WANT TO BE SAFE THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL COME HOME IN THE EVENING. THEY WANT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT HEALTH AND THEY DON'T WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO LEAVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. THEY WANT GOODS POLICE OFFICERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO MAKE THEM SAFE. AND SO THIS IS A THIS IS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR ME. MUCH OLDER THAN A HUNDRED AND THEN EIGHTEEN OF FIFTY I THINK. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE OH SEVEN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THIS IS A FOUR HUNDRED YEAR CHALLENGE TO AN AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THIS COUNTRY. BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITION OF OUR LIVES AND THE BONE ABILITY OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WHETHER WAS DEALING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WEATHER WAS DEALING WITH LYNCH MOB TO WHAT IT WAS. IT WAS THAT WHOLE ISSUE THAT WE HAD ALL OUR LIVES TO ALWAYS BE CURIOUS. AND COULD EASILY BE TAKEN WITHOUT ANY JUSTICE OR ANYONE FIGHTING BACK. AND SO I TOOK THIS RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I RESPECT YOU. AND I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WERE DOING. THAT THIS IS GOING TO MAKE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT IS ALL THE AND AND AND ALL OF THE ANALYSIS SAYS THAT THIS WILL BE THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE OF THE STRONG THIS BILL. ABOUT WHEN YOU USE LETHAL FORCE IN ANY STATE. IN THIS NATION. AND I'M JUST GRATEFUL TO ALL OF YOU WHO LISTEN TO ME. WHO HUNG IN THERE WHO ASKED ME QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN? BUT I'M ALSO BLOW EQUALLY WAS THANKFUL TO MY CHURCH. THAT RAY FOR ME. BECAUSE WHEN THIS WHEN THE WHEN THE TIDES TURN LAST WEDNESDAY AND SOMEONE SAID THEY WERE LOOKING AT TELEVISION AND THEY SAW THIS. THEY SAID LOOK AT GOD. AND THAT WAS PROFOUND FOR THEM THAT THIS WAS A FORCE THAT SOMEHOW ANOTHER THIS ONE LITTLE WOMAN OUT OF EIGHTY THISBILL WITH HER COLLEAGUES. AND THAT A FORCE IS ALWAYS BEEN BEHIND US TO MOVE US FORWARD THE THE FORCE OF JUSTICE THE FORCE pTHE FORCE OF BREAKING THIS NATION A BETTER NATION EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AND SO I'M THANKFUL TO THEM. BUT I'M ALSO MOSTLY THANKFUL TO TO LOOK HERE TO INSPIRE ME EVERY DAY. AND THE NAME IS COULD DEAR ANGELA HILL. MY GRANDSON'S WAS. SEVEN FIVE BECAUSE I'VE MADE A COMMITMENT THAT I NEVER WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM. THE LIFE IS IDEALLY. THEY HAVE GREAT FRIENDS OF ALL COLORS THEY ENJOYED LIFE AND THEY BELIEVE AT THIS POINT. THAT THEY HAVE JUST AS MUCH RIGHT AND RESPECT AS ANY OTHER CHILD IN THIS NATION. AND THAT SHOULD NEVER CHANGE.

AND THIS BILL -- THIS BILL PERMITS BUSINESSES TO COMPLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT. WHILE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITH INFORMATION ESSENTIAL TO PREVENTING FRAUD AND OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THIS IS ALL BASED ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. LAST YEAR -- ADDITIONALLY UNDER THIS BILL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS PERSONAL DATA CONTENT TO CONTINUE OPERATING MANDATED PROGRAMS.

I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. ON MISTER COOLIES BILL. THANK YOU MISTER DALY. MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS -- I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WHAT THIS BILL IS ESSENTIALLY DOING? IS EXEMPTING. THE GOVERNMENT. FROM THE PROTECTIONS OF THE CCPA. A WHEN WE PASS THAT LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THAT LANDMARK LEGISLATION WE SAID THAT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. NEED THIS PROTECTION THEY NEED THESE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. AND WE DIDN'T SAY THEY WERE GOING TO EXEMPT OUT GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. YEAH WE'VE BEEN SAYING WE WE DON'T LIKE HOW BIG BUSINESS. IS USING OUR DATA. AND WAY MORE UPSET ABOUT THAT WE WANT TO PUT. REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS UPON THAT. ONE ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS PRIVACY DATE IS PROTECTED FROM BEING SOLD WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION EXCEPT FOR BUT IN THIS BILL WE'RE SAYING HEY BUT IF GOVERNMENT NEEDS THAT FOR A PROGRAM. NO PROBLEM. CONSUMER PRIVACY RIGHTS. TAKE A BACKSEAT. TO GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND ALSO THIS WAS EXPRESSED IN COMMITTEE. THEY'RE STILL HASN'T REALLY BEEN ANY SHOWING OF HOUSE CCPA IS GOING TO SOMEHOW UNDERMINE. GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO DO ITS JOB AND CARRY OUT PROGRAMS. CCPA SIMPLY SAYS THAT HEY IF IF YOU'RE A CONSUMER YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK. WHAT DATA IS BEING COLLECTED FROM YOU YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT? OF YOUR DATA BEING TRANSMITTED. AND THERE'S BEEN NO DEMONSTRATION YET THROUGH THIS BILL. AS TO WHY GOVERNMENT NEEDS THIS THIS PROTECTION OR TO CARRY OUT ITS GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS IS GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. NOW THE AUTHORS SAID HE WAS GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS BUT THIS BILL STILL HASN'T CHANGED MORE ESSENTIALLY PASSING OVER TO THE SENATE. A BIG BLANKET EXEMPTION FOR GOVERNMENT WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY RIGHTS. I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT AND I DON'T THINK THIS BODY SHOULD BE OKAY WITH THAT. I REGION OF THE DOCTOR QUIRK.

ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES. ALL FILE ITEM SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN PASS TEMPORARILY. WE'RE A FILE ITEM NINETEEN AB FIVE BY MS GONZALEZ CORKERY. ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE BY SHOULD REMEMBER GONZALEZ AND I RELATE TO EMPLOYMENT MAKING IT A PROBATIONER. FOR MS GONZALEZ EMAIL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE THE SUPREME COURT HAS DECIDED THE DYNAMICS DECISION THAT WE'VE ALL I'M SURE HEARD A LOT ABOUT. THEY DECIDED AT THAT POINT THAT THERE HAD BEEN ENOUGH DISCUSSION ABOUT OF PREVIOUS CARRILLO TEST AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE IT CLEARER. WHO WAS AN EMPLOYEE AND WHO WAS NOT? THE TRUTH IS COLLEAGUES THAT MISS CLASSIFICATION IS SOMETHING THAT OUR STATE HAS BEEN DEALING WITH FOR DECADES AND AS A RESULT. WE LOSE UPWARDS OF EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. BECAUSE OF LOST WAGES LOST TAXES BECAUSE IT EXPENDITURES WE HAVE TO MAKE IT THE STATE WHEN BUSINESSES MISCLASSIFIED THEIR WORKERS. HIGHER THAT DECISION LEFT A LOT OF UNCERTAINTIES. AND SO WHAT AB FIVE DOES IS CODIFY THAT DECISION SO THAT WE'RE NOT STUCK IN COURT OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. DETERMINING EACH INDIVIDUAL SMALL INDUSTRY AND HOW IT APPLIES SINCE THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN CLEAR WE KNOW HOW TO APPLY. AND TO ADD CERTAINTY TO OUR BUSINESSES THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE OF TRADITIONAL WAGE ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE OF THIS IDEA OF NEEDING TO PROTECT WORKERS. THERE INDUSTRIES BY AND FAR WHERE WORKERS MAKE -- MORE THAN TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE ARE STANDARD FOR BEING ABLE TO BE EXEMPT FROM OVERTIME. AND WAIT CHEN MEAL BREAKS. THEIR INDUSTRIES THAT ARE. THAT CAN ACTUALLY SERVE AS INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES WHERE THEY'RE NEGOTIATING THEIR OWN SALARIES NOT JUST ABOUT FLEXIBILITY BUT ACTUALLY ABOUT THEIR SAID IN THEIR OWN RATES. IN ENSURING THAT THEY CAN OPERATE AND WILL OPERATE AS RESPONSIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES. SO OUR BILL IS WORK IN PROGRESS IT'S NOT COMPLETE. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD IN ORDER TO GIVE CERTAINTY TO BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. TO GIVE CERTAINTY THE WORKERS THAT ARE SO THAT WE SEEK TO PROTECT. NOT ONLY IN THIS BILL BUT THAT THE SUPREME COURT SOUGHT TO PROTECT IN THEIR DECISION. IN CERTAINTY TO TAXPAYERS THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR INDUSTRIES IN FOR BIG BUSINESSES THEY REFUSE TO ADEQUATELY PAID THEIR WORKERS. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORKING POOR IN CALIFORNIA. WORKERS WHO HAVE TO RELY ON SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE IN SUBSIDIZED HOUSING THAT RELY ON FOOD STAMPS. WE HAVE TO RELY ON EMERGENCY ROOM CARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE. IN SO MANY OF THESE WORKERS ARE MISCLASSIFIED AND THAT'S A BURDEN ON TAXPAYERS THAT WE NEED TO RELIEVE AS WELL.AB FIVE SIX TO DO THIS. BY CODIFYING THE DYNAMICS DECISION BUT PROVIDING CLEAR EXEMPTIONS FOR CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. THAT WE DON'T WORRY ABOUT AS MUCH ALTHOUGH THEY'LL STILL BE HELD TO THE PEARL OF STANDARD. THESE INDUSTRIES INCLUDE PHYSICIANS INSURANCE AGENTS FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND DIRECT SELLERS. REAL ESTATE LICENSEES. HAIRSTYLES A BARBER'S TO FUNCTION AS SMALL BUSINESSES ARE IN OUR FREE FROM THE DIRECTION AND CONTROL THE SALON WHERE THEY LEASE THEIR SPACE. IN INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTED SMALL BUSINESSES PROVIDING SERVICES THAT REQUIRE A LICENSE IN LAW. DENTISTRY ARCHITECTURE ENGINEERING AND ACCOUNTING OR REQUIRE AN ADVANCED DEGREE THAT INVOLVES SPECIALIZED COURSE OF STUDY AND IN MARKETING OR HUMAN RESOURCE ADMINISTRATION. AGAIN THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET. TO EVERYBODY'S -- CONCERNS. WE PROBABLY CAN'T. BUT I WOULD ASK YOU TO ASK YOURSELF ARE WE BETTER OFF. WITH THIS BILL THEN THE UNCERTAINTY THAT'S IN THE LOT TODAY. AND I THINK WE ARE AND I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN CONTINUE TO PUSH IT WE WILL BE EVEN MORE SO. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I TODAY TO KEEP THIS DISCUSSION GOING TO KEEP MOVING TO PROTECT WORKERS TO GIVE CERTAINTY TO BUSINESSES AND TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MR MEDINA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE LEGISLATURE CANNOT TURN A BLIND EYE TO COMPANIES WHO EXPLOIT WORKERS BY INTENTIONALLY MISS CLASSIFYING THEM AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THESE COMPANIES CALL THEM WORKERS SMALL BUSINESSES IT CONTINUE TO SET THE WORKERS RATES DIRECT HOW THE WORKER MUST DO THEIR JOB AND IMPOSE DISCIPLINE UPON THEM EVEN WHILE THE WORKER IS DOING THE MAIN WORK OF THE BUSINESS. EVERY DAY WORKING CALIFORNIANS DESERVE BASIC PROTECTIONS THAT ALLOW THEM TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES THIS BILL IS A NECESSARY STEP. TOWARD REBUILDING OUR MIDDLE CLASS. AB FIVE STRIKES A FAIR BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING CALIFORNIA WORKERS FROM BEING DENIED THE RIFLE WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS. AND HOLDING BAD ACTORS ACCOUNTABLE AND ALLOWING TRUE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND GOOD COMPANIES TO STAY IN BUSINESS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS COMMON SENSE LEGISLATION. THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA DOCTOR QUIRK. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I KNOW WHO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB -- FIVE AS THE MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO SAD. YOU MAY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL BUT NO BILL AT ALL WOULD BE FAR WORSE. WE DON'T WANT THE COURTS MAKING ALL THESE DECISIONS FRANKLY AS I READ THE DYNAMICS DECISION. WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT ALMOST NOBODY COULD BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW SOME PEOPLE TO BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. FURTHER AS SOON AS THAT DECISION WAS MADE I HAD MANY MEMBERS OF MY MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS COME TO MY OFFICE WHO ARE INDEPENDENT TRUCKERS. MOSTLY SOUTH ASIANS PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM THE SIX COMMUNITY. THEY VERY MUCH WANT TO CONTINUE AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS -- AND I AGREE WITH THEM. I IN TALKING WITH BUSINESS IS MY AREA FOR EXAMPLE IN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. JUST SILVA GROUP WHICH BILLS MANY HOMES WILL ONE DAY NEED A THOUSAND TRUCKERS AND THE NEXT DAY NEED. FIFTY AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY. SO I AM ASKING YOU TO WORK WITH ME TO GET THIS BILL UP TO THE SENATE. AND FIRST ALL TO TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO ABOUT THE THINGS WE WANT CONTINUED IN THE BELL. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT BUT IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN NO BILL AT ALL SO AGAIN I URGE YOU TO VOTE I ON AB. FIVE MR FRAZIER. YOUR RECKONS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BUT CONTINUE TO HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS. I LIKE TO SEE THE BILL CONTAINED A BROADER EXEMPTION FOR BUSINESS TO BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. INSTEAD OF CARVING OUT VERY SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES WE HAVE OVER TWELVE HUNDRED EMPLOYMENT CENTERS. IN CALIFORNIA AND TO DO THIS WITH THIS BILL. WOULD BE PUNITIVE. IF TO INDEPENDENT -- INDEPENDENTLY FOR BUSINESSES REGARDLESS OF THEIR INDUSTRY WISH TO ENGAGE EACH OTHER IN PROVIDING SERVICES THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO. UNDER THE TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS SAYS. MEMBERS I WAS A CONTRACTOR FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS. PAYING ALL THE FEES [inaudible] INSURANCES BARNES AND HIRING. APPROPRIATE CONTRACTORS WOULD LICENSES AND CLASSIFICATIONS. TO DO MY SUB WORK. WHAT I'M HOPING WE DON'T DO? HIS DESTROY ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THAT WOULD BE CRIMINAL. ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS THE BACKBONE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND EMBRACE. TAKING THE RISK [inaudible] NOT US. THEY'RE GOING OUT THERE AND PUTTING THEIR CAPITAL AND THEIR LIVELIHOOD ON THE LINE EVERY DAY. AND SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THESE BUSINESSES. WITH THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF REGULATION TO SUPPORT AND ALSO HELP THEM [inaudible] BUT UNDERSTANDING. THAT I'VE DONE BILLS FOR MISS CLASSIFICATION WORKER ANIMAL ALL POLL OF INDUSTRIES OR ANYBODY WHO DOES THAT. JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. I DO NOT SUPPORT THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. AS A CONTRACTOR WHO PAID ALL OF HIS FEES. INAPPROPRIATE MANNERS. I WANT THIS LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND. THE SMALL BUSINESS MATTERS AND IF WE DON'T SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS OR BUSINESS IN GENERAL. STILL HAVE NO REASON TO EMPLOY THE EMPLOYEES THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO BE PROTECTED. WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS CONCERNED. HER TALKING TO SEVERAL OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS CAUCUS AND TAKING THE TIME AND UNDERSTANDING. SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND I OR HER WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS THOSE AS SHE GOES FORWARD [inaudible] BUT MEMBERS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUALLY EMBRACING CALIFORNIA IS THE CONCERNS OF SMALL BUSINESS WITH THIS ALL BE SUPPORTING AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT THIS TIME. THIS COOPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS -- ARISES BOARD OF AB. FIVE CALIFORNIA'S ESTIMATED TO HAVE NEARLY TWO MILLION RESIDENTS WHO CHOOSE TO WORK THE DEPEND CONTRACTORS. AFTER DOT NET DECISION CAME OUT THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION AND MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS WERE QUITE CONCERNED. I RAISE THOSE CONCERNS EARLY ON ABOUT HOW THIS LAW WOULD AFFECT EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTORS REALTORS AND TRUCKERS IN MY DISTRICT. I APPLAUD LABOR BUSINESS FOR COMING TOGETHER AND WORKING ON A COMPROMISE BILL. A BILL TO PROTECT THE WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES HOWEVER LET'S SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY HELP WITH THE BROADER EXEMPTION LANGUAGE WHEN THE BILL RETURNS IN THE SENATE TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE. RIVER LEE INCLUDED IN THIS DECISION [inaudible] MR OBERNOLTE. MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB -- FIVE I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT THIS IS AN ACTION THAT. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO TAKE. I THOUGHT WAS VERY INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE SUPREME COURT TO ATTEMPT TO LEGISLATE THIS ISSUE AND IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE TAKING THIS ACTION. HOWEVER I HAVE SOME DIRE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN WOULD MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. AND I'D LIKE TO ILLUSTRATE MY CONCERNS WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN LIFE MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT. I OWN A VIDEO GAME DEVELOPMENT STUDIO YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW I STARTED THAT STUDIO THIRTY YEARS AGO OUT OF MY DORM ROOM AT CAL TECH. I ANSWER ONE ADD ON A BULLETIN BOARD I STARTED WRITING VIDEO GAMES AND THIS WAS AT A TIME WHEN THE GAMES WERE SIMPLE IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO DO EVERYTHING. SO I TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING I DID THE THINGS THAT I WAS GOOD AT THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAMMING I DID THE THINGS I WAS NOT GOOD AT THE ART THE ANIMATION AND I DID THE THINGS. I'M EMBARRASSED TO SAY THAT I WAS TERRIBLE AT I TRIED TO DO THE SOUND THE MUSIC MYSELF. AND MY PUBLISHER CAME BACK TO ME THEY SAID THIS GAME YOU'RE WRITING IT'S FANTASTIC IT'S REALLY FUN TO PLAY WITH THE MUSIC IS HORRIBLE. AND SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF MAYBE THIS ISN'T AN OPERABLE BUSINESS STRATEGY TO DO EVERYTHING MYSELF SO I FOUND ANOTHER STUDENT. WHO ACTUALLY HAD SOME TALENT IN MUSIC AND ASKED THEM IF THEY'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW DOLLARS WRITING THE MUSIC FOR MY GAME AND THEY DID AND THAT ACTUALLY LEAD TO A WHOLE CAREER FOR THEM? WRITING MUSIC AND VIDEO GAMES AND IT LED TO ME MAKING AN ACCEPTABLE GAME IN THE NEXT GAME I WROTE. I CONTRACTED OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE STUFF THAT I WASN'T GOOD AT AND THEN AS WE GOT BIGGER OVER THE YEARS I CONTRACTED OUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS GOOD AT AND THEN EVENTUALLY WE GOT BIG ENOUGH AND STABLE ENOUGH THAT WE COULD OPEN. A BRICK AND MORTAR LOCATION TO BRING PEOPLE ON HIS EMPLOYEES AND NOW THIRTY YEARS LATER WE DON'T DO ANY OUTSOURCING AT ALL ALL OF OUR WORK IS DONE BY OUR EMPLOYEES. BUT IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN TODAY AND THE CURRENT DYNAMICS DECISION WAS THE LAW OF THE LAND IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUBCONTRACT ANY OF THAT INITIAL GAME THAT I WROTE BECAUSE IT WOULD VIOLATE THE SO CALLED B. PILLAR. IN THE DYNAMICS DECISION WHICH SAYS THAT THE WORK THAT YOU CONTRACT CANNOT BE RELATED TO THE CORE BUSINESS THAT YOU'RE PERFORMING AND CERTAINLY DOING MUSIC FOR A GAME OR ANIMATION FOR GAME IS RELATED. SO I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WHAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN LOTS OF A LOST MY CONTRACT FOR THAT FIRST GAME. AND MY COMPANY WOULD NOT EXIST TODAY. AND THE MARKET HITS AVOID SO MY COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN STARTED BY SOMEBODY ELSE. BUT IN A DIFFERENT STATE OTHER THAN CALIFORNIA AND HUNDREDS OF JOBS OF MY COMPANIES GENERATED OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS OF WILL HAVE BEEN LOST. AND I WOULD HAVE A PRETTY MINOR CONSEQUENCE FOR CALIFORNIA BUT OTHER START UPS THAT HAVE FOUND -- THEIR THEIR GENESIS HERE THAT WOULD NOT BE SO MINOR I'M TALKING ABOUT COMPANIES LIKE APPLE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO HONOR THAT SPIRIT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ISM THAT WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THAT THIS BILL IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. THAT WOULD NOT BE TRUE. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THREE THINGS AS AS BILL MOVES FORWARD FIRST OF ALL IT'S VERY CLEAR TO ME. THAT -- THE DEFINITION OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES NEED TO BE EXPANDED SO THE AUTHORS ACTUALLY BEEN VERY CONSCIENTIOUS SHE'S BEEN VERY DILIGENT ABOUT TAKING A LOOK AT THESE ISSUES. LAST WEEK THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL THAT ADDED AN EXEMPTION FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES BUT IT'S WORDED VERY NARROWLY IT'S ONLY IF YOU HAVE. A LICENSE FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OR IF YOU'RE IN THE PRESS THE FIELDS OF HUMAN RESOURCES ARE MARKETING. AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE MY INDUSTRY WOULD BE VERY INSULTED IF WE TOLD THEM THAT THEY WEREN'T PROFESSIONALS I THINK WE NEED TO BROADEN THAT. TO INCLUDE PEOPLE THAT DO HIGHLY SKILLED WORK AND A DEGREE OF ADVANCED DEGREES INDICATION OF THAT BUT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT OF THAT. I ALSO THINK THAT THIS BILL NEEDS A AN EXEMPTION FOR SMALL BUSINESS IF YOU HAVE NOT VERY MANY EMPLOYEES MAYBE LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS GROSS REVENUE LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES -- I IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. TO COMPLY WITH THE RESTRICTIONS PLACED IN THIS BILL I KNOW THAT WHEN I WAS IN MY DORM ROOM THERE'S NO WAY I COULD HAVE HIRED AN EMPLOYEE I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION -- WAGE LAWS -- BENEFITS OR VACATION TIME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE SO I THINK WE SERIOUSLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE CAN STILL START BUSINESSES HERE. AND LASTLY I THINK THAT THIS BILL BADLY NEEDS A BUSINESS TO BUSINESS EXEMPTION. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THAT ENJOY BEING EMPLOYEES BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THAT LIKE BEING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. AND IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE AND YOU'VE TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO INCORPORATE YOUR OWN COMPANY OR TO USE VIOLENCE A DBA AND DO BUSINESS AS A SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP IF YOU HAVE A BUSINESS LICENSE. THEN I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR CURRENT MODE OF WORKING. SO I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ACT ON BUT I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL IS CURRENTLY WORDED I ORIGINAL VOTE. MISTER DALLI YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I TOO MUST RISE IN OPPOSITION. THIS IS ACTUALLY IMPACT MY OWN BUSINESS. I ALONG WITH MY CALLING FROM BIG BEAR HAD THE SAME. SITUATION WE HARVEST OUR CROPS. AND IN TIME WE NEED TO HARVEST THOSE CROPS WE HAVE TO GET ABOUT A CERTAIN TIME BEFORE THE WEATHER CHANGES. AND SO. UNFORTUNATELY I AM IN THE TRUCKING BUSINESS BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET TRUCKS WHEN I NEEDED TRUCKS TO MOVE MY COMMODITIES. AND AT THAT TIME IN YOUR WEEK. HIGHER ON INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS -- AND WE MAY ACTUALLY OWN THE TRAILER AND THEY BRING THE POWER UNIT IN THE TRACTOR. TO PULL OUR COMMODITIES IN SO THIS ONE AREA THAT'S GOING TO REALLY IMPACT MYSELF AND MY NEIGHBORS -- UNDER THIS RULE I SEE I I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE AMENDMENTS I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING. DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO IRON OUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES -- BUT SMALL BUSINESSES REALLY NEEDED TO HAVE A BREAK IN THIS AREA. AND NUMBER -- TWO ALSO I CHECKED HIM IMAGE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO GO BACK AND READ THROUGH AND UNDER THE ORIGINAL CARRILLO LAW WE WERE. ASSUMING WE WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING BUT IF WEEK RETROACTIVE BACK WE'RE GONNA BE A LOT OF OF FOLKS IN THE WORLD OF THE LAW THAT WILL BE GOING AFTER BUSINESSES WHO AT THAT TIME THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR -- THERE A LOT OF US WHO WORKED. TO OBEY THE LAWS AND THEY CHANGE RAPIDLY AROUND HERE AND TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THEM AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IS VERY DIFFICULT SO AT THIS POINT -- I WILL BE NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL AND LOOK FOR TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN THE SENATE AND HOPEFULLY -- BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT WHERE WE CAN HELP. A SMALL BUSINESSES STAY IN BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER ALLEY I SEE A NUMBER OF MICROPHONES MEMBERS I'D ASK YOU KEEP YOUR COMMENTS VERY CONCISE DOCTOR EGGMAN. DOCTOR EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS -- I ALSO WANT TO THINK -- THE AUTHOR FROM SAN DIEGO FOR HER DILIGENT WORK ON THIS COMPLICATED ISSUE. MR CLASSIFYING VULNERABLE WORKERS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM NOT JUST IN THIS STATE BUT ACROSS THE NATION I HISTORICALLY AND CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. AND CLEARLY AS THE NATURE OF WORK CONTINUES TO CHANGE -- AS WE EVOLVE IN OUR ECONOMY OUR LAWS NEED TO EVOLVE TO TO MAINTAIN THAT SO I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE -- AS THE AUTHOR STATED MORE WORK WILL CONTINUE TO BE DONE REPRESENTING AND DISTRICT IS LARGELY AGRICULTURE AND IS MISSED BY. MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER TALKED ABOUT. MONIES COME IN THEY COME OUT AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ENTREPRENEURS OWNER OPERATED TRUCKERS WHO ARE OUT THERE HOLDING COMMODITIES. SHORT TERM SOMETIMES YOU KNOW. GOT A JOB IT NEEDS TO BE FILLED -- IT WITH A LOT OF THE UNCERTAINTY WE HAVE KNOWING THAT YOU CAN GET YOUR CROPS THE MARKET ON TIME OR THINGS DELIVERED WHERE THEY NEED TO BE IS. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SO AS THIS CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD I LOOK FORWARD TO START HAVE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION HOPE ALL THE PARTY STAY AT THE TABLE AS WE TALK ABOUT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OWNER OPERATED -- AND I LOOK FOR TO THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD TODAY AND IS CONTINUE TO HAVE FRUITFUL DIALOGUES GOING FORWARD IS RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT AB FIVE SHOULD BE BROADER RATHER THAN CARVING OUT SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES. MANY AND MANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE TEACHERS WHO CHOOSE TO WORK AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS SUCH AS TUTORS AND THEY DO SO IN ADDITION TO THEIR FULL TIME JOBS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE DURING THE SUMMER WHEN THESE TEACHERS HAVE MORE TIME TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY WE NEED TO HELP PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE SUCH IMPORTANT WORK TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOMES. WHILE I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I WANT TO SEE BROADER EXEMPTION LANGUAGE WHEN THE BILL RETURNED FROM THE SENATE THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS KAMLAGER-DOVE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE AN ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT A NUMBER OF MY OF MY COLLEAGUES. HAVE HAVE SHARED I HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT AND MANY OF WHOM -- BUT THERE ARE WOMEN THERE WOMEN OF COLOR THEY ARE ENTREPRENEURS -- AND I THEY BELIEVE IN THEIR SMALL BUSINESS IT IS A PART OF THE YOU KNOW THEIR OWN DESTINY IN TERMS OF THEIR FUTURE AND THEIR ABILITY TO TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES AND AND BENEFIT THEIR FAMILIES. THEY DON'T WANT TO BECOME EMPLOYEES MANY OF THEM HAVE SHARED THAT THEY ACTUALLY TRIED THIS AS A RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE DYNAMICS DECISION. AND IT FAILED MISERABLY IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES -- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING THESE WOMEN THESE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THESE ENTREPRENEURS -- THEY'RE LOOKING TO FILL THEIR FUTURE WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING WORKERS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT ALLOWING WAGE THEFT. AND OTHER ATROCITIES THAT CONTINUE TO DEMEAN AND DEMORALIZE WORKERS -- TO TAKE A FACT IN THIS ECONOMY SO I AM HOPING THAT -- MORE CONVERSATIONS CAN HAPPEN ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO THOSE IN THE PERSONAL CARE INDUSTRIES BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU WAS COUNTY MISTER KALRA. YOU'RE RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER YOU KNOW CODIFYING DYNAMAX IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE -- FOR WORKERS AND RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYERS LIKE THREADING. TEN NEEDLES AT ONE TIME I REALLY WANT TO THANK AND COMMEND THE AUTHOR -- AT EVERY COMMITTEE LEVEL THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS AMENDMENTS AND EXEMPTIONS AND THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE -- I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST ESPECIALLY TO THOSE THAT ARE RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE UP TO READ DYNAMAX UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WOULD DO TO OUR EMPLOYERS -- IF WE DO NOTHING ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT SUBSEQUENT COURT CASE THAT MADE IT RETROACTIVE THERE ARE -- BUT MANY HUNDREDS OF LAWSUITS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE BEING INITIATED BECAUSE OF THE CONFUSION AND BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY WITHOUT THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD AND CONTINUING TO BE WORKED ON IN TERMS OF ADDING APPROPRIATE. AMENDMENTS AND FLEXIBILITY OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND OUR WORKERS GOING TO BE LEFT IN LIMBO -- UNLIKE ANY SITUATION THAT WE'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND SO -- I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR I WANT TO THANK. EVERYONE THAT'S GIVEN SUGGESTIONS AND ADVICE I'VE MET MYSELF WITH MANY MANY DOZENS OF INDUSTRIES I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR VOICING THEIR CONCERN AND CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS AND I BELIEVE VOTING FOR AB BY TODAY ALLOWS US THAT CONTINUED. CONVERSATION IN OVER TO THE SENATE BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY EMPLOYERS IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE DEMANDING -- MORE CLARITY AND I THINK AB FIVE ALLOWS US OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE CLARITY AND PROTECT WORKERS AND FOR THAT I STRONGLY SUGGEST MY ABOUT. SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE MRS ALL SHE MAKE CLOTHES. AND CLOSE I JUST WANT TO BRING LIGHT TO A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE SAID BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE. CONFUSED BY SOME COMMENTS AND I I FEAR THAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND NUMBER ONE THE DYNAMICS RULING AND WHAT IT MEANS TO PUT IT INTO LAW. NOTHING IN DYNAMAX OR IN LAW WILL PREVENT -- TEN NINETY NINE INTERACTIONS I MEAN THERE ARE ACTUALLY VALID INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THERE ARE VALID SMALL BUSINESSES THAT INTERACT WITH OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES AND AND MAY PAGE OTHER THROUGH A TEN NINETY NINE THIS WILL NOT PREVENT THAT THERE IS A CONTRACTOR SUBCONTRACTOR RELATIONSHIP THAT WILL NOT CHANGE. SO THE LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP TODAY I THINK -- COULD BE RESOLVED IF MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO COME TO MY OFFICE AND SIT DOWN WITH ME WE CAN HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS I REALLY AYE EVERYBODY WAS ASKED FOR IT I I'VE TRIED. TO ACCOMMODATE -- AS PART OF THE PERSONAL CARE INDUSTRY THAT -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES PRODUCT WE I THINK WE OUTLINED PRETTY CLEARLY WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE FOR HAIR STYLIST WE DO PLAN. TO TO BROADEN NOT IN THE PERSONAL CARE -- INDUSTRY WE WE STARTED WITH HERE SALAS BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S EXISTING WAGE ORDER LIKE EVERYTHING WE STARTED WITH IT IT'S THINGS THAT ARE IN EXISTING WAGE ORDERS WHETHER THEY'RE DOCTORS OR INSURANCE AGENT SO. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING FROM THAT. ASPECT IN ASK THINGS ARE BROUGHT FOR WE CONTINUED TO WORK ON THIS. THE WHEN IT COMES TO TRUCK DRIVERS I THINK WE HAVE TO SAY THIS THAT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT I HAVE TO BE HONEST PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT ISSUE. I'VE EVER TRIED TO DEAL WITH AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY THE DYNAMICS DECISION DON'T WITH TRUCK DRIVERS WE KNOW THAT IT'S WHEN THE MOST MISCLASSIFIED INDUSTRIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ABOUT 82% A POOR TRUCK DRIVERS ARE CLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND WE KNOW ABOUT SO HOW WE MAKE EXEMPTIONS OR IF WE DO FOR INDEPENDENT -- OWNER OPERATORS WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT JUST PROVIDING ANOTHER AVENUE BY WHICH COMPANIES CAN CONTINUE. BASICALLY ARE AT PREVENTS WORKERS FROM BEING ABLE TO BE HAVE A SUSTAINABLE LIFE. ANDSO -- THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN COMPLEX IT'S BEEN TOUGH I I HAVE PROMISED AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS I I WANT TO GET THERE AND I DON'T WANT ANYONE WHO'S INVESTED A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS INTO A TRUCK. TO NOT BE ABLE TO USE THAT TRUCK I AM COMMITTED TO GETTING TO SOMETHING ON TRUCKERS BUT I WANT PEOPLETO UNDERSTAND JUST HOW COMPLEX THIS IS DYNAMICS WAS WRITTEN BECAUSE THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THE DECISION ITSELF IS IMPORTANT WE'RE TALKING I'M A ONE MORE THING JUST TO BE CLEAR BUSINESS TO BUSINESS INTERACTION AND WE CAN CLARIFY THIS IN THE SENATE THERE IS NOTHING THAT WILL PREVENT A BIT OF A GENUINE SMALL BUSINESS. FROM FROM CONTRACTING WITH OR OUTSOURCING TWO A GENUINE SMALL BUSINESS WHAT WE WANT TO PREVENT IS THIS DISTINCTION WHERE INDIVIDUAL WORKERS WHO TRULY AREN'T SMALL BUSINESSES. ARE BEING IDENTIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. AND THAT SHOULD WORRY YOU BECAUSE IT COST ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS IT COST US ALL. BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE HEALTH CARE AND THEY'RE HURT ON THE JOB IN THEIR IN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. BECAUSE THE MERCHANTS THE ROOM AND WE ALL PAY FOR THAT. WHEN SOMEBODY LOSES THEIR JOB AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BECAUSE THERE ARE NO ZERO PROTECTIONS THEY DON'T HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND WE ALL PAY FOR THE SERVICES THAT THEY HAVE TO RELY ON? WHEN SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE OUR PAID SICK LEAVE THEY SIMPLY CAN'T WORK IN SOMETIME HAVE TO RELY ON WELFARE OR FOOD STAMPS SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FREE LUNCH FOR THEIR KIDS WE ALL PAY FOR THAT? IN SOME OF THE COMPANIES ENGAGING IN THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR WHO ARE REFUSING TO TREAT THEIR WORKERS THE WAY WE EXPECT EMPLOYERS TO TREAT WORKERS IN THE SOCIAL CONTRACT THAT WE HAVE. BETWEEN EMPLOYMENT WORKERS AND TAXPAYERS SOME OF THOSE COMPANIES ARE DOING JUST FINE. THEIR CEOS MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WHILE WE'RE SUBSIDIZING AS TAXPAYERS THEIR WORKERS. THERE IS SOMETHING CRITICALLY WRONG WITH THAT SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK THIS OUT IN EVERY ASPECT THAT IT. ALL AND ANY OF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THAT WE CAN MAKE WE WILL MAKE. WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. BECAUSE OUR CONSTITUENT TAXPAYERS DON'T DESERVE TO SUBSIDIZE BIG BUSINESS. AND IT QUITE HONESTLY WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY PLAYS BY THE SAME RULES. SO THIS IS A BILL THAT -- IT KIND OF CONFUSES ME WHEN PEOPLE SAY I HOPE YOU KEEP WORKING ON THIS BUT I HOPE YOU BOTH KNOW IF YOU WILL NO I CAN'T KEEP WORKING ON THIS. AND THAT MEANS THE DYNAMAX RULING STANDS. AND THE RETROACTIVITY COURT CASE STANDS AND THAT MEANS THERE ARE GOING TO BE A TON OF LAWSUITS. AND A TON ACOSTA BUSINESS. SO WHAT ARE YOU CARE ABOUT WORKERS AS YOUR PRIMARY CONCERN LIKE I DO. OR WHETHER YOU CARE ABOUT BUSINESS IS BECAUSE YOU WANT CERTAINTY AND YOU WANT TO DRESS RETRACTED BEING YOU WANT TO DRESS. SOME SORT OF CERTAINTY OR WHETHER YOU JUST CARE ABOUT TAXPAYERS PICKING UP THE SLACK FOR COMPANIES THAT DON'T DO THEIR FAIR SHARE.

LAST YEAR GROUP PLACED OVER FOUR HUNDRED ADS ON FACEBOOK TRYING TO KILL A NET NEUTRALITY BILL.

MISTER BLOOM OU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS REMOVING LAND USE BARRIERS TO EQUITABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN HIGH RESOURCE AREAS OF THE STATE. THESE ARE PLACES WITH GOOD SCHOOLS JOBS -- ETCETERA IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE DRESSING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS AND INCREASING CHOICE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. IT'S ALSO CRUCIAL TO MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS BY ENSURING THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK IN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE. HI RESOURCE AREAS MAY OR MAY NOT BE NEAR EXISTING HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT HOWEVER THEY CAN SUPPORT GREEN INFILL DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS CRUCIAL TO SUPPORTING FUTURE TRANSITING STANCHION. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING THE STATE'S HOUSING NEEDS AND OF COURSE WE ARE AND REDUCING AUTO DEPENDENCE AND WE ARE. I THINK IN A CORD ON THAT AS WELL THEN WE NEED TO INCREASE DENSITY AND EXPAND INFILL DEVELOPMENT IN MORE PARTS OF THE STATE. LAST YEAR WE PASSED AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE WHICH REFORM THE RAIN ALLOCATION PROCESS AND UNDER THAT BILL HIGH RESOURCE AREAS OF THE STATE. THAT LACK HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR LOWER WAGE WORKFORCE WILL BE RECEIVING A LARGER SHARE OF THE RINA THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. AB TWELVE SEVENTY NINE DOWN HELPS TO ENSURE THAT THESE INCREASED RINA ALLOCATIONS TRANSLATE INTO ACTUAL HOUSING UNITS. THE BILL ENCOURAGES THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL SCALE MARKET RATE HOUSING SUCH AS DUPLEXES TRI PLEX ISN'T FOR PLEXUS IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN MIDDLE INCOME MIDDLE INCOME AND AFFORDABLE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. ALONG MAIN ROADS AND IN OUR DOWNTOWN AREAS IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIGH RESOURCE COMMUNITIES TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO ACCOMMODATE. THESE TYPES OF HOUSING IN NOT THE BILL THEN PROVIDES FOR STREAMLINED APPROVAL PROCESS TO ENSURE THE PROJECTS CAN MOVE FORWARD TO PROVIDE NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THESE AREAS. AB TWELVE SEVENTY NINE CONTINUES TO BE A WORK IN PROGRESS. WE ARE WORKING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND SEE SACK TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL CAN DELIVER ON ITS PROMISE OF PROVIDING MORE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. IN PLACES WHERE LOWER AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES ARE CURRENTLY PRICED OUT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL OTHER THAN ONE SMALL CITY.

THE AFFAIR PLAN IN FACT IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE NUMBER RESIDENTS COVERED BY FAIR PLAN POLICIES IN THEIR WILD URBAN LIFE INTERFACES GROW BY 35%. AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE LAST TO CATASTROPHIC FIRES. THE PAIR PLAN DOES NOT HAVE THE NUMBER FOR THIS YEAR BUT IN SOME KIND OF WRIST COUNTIES THEY'RE RUNNING 3100% AHEAD OF LAST YEAR.

OUR GOAL WITH THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION THAT ULTIMATELY PROVIDE STABILITY REPAIRS. WILDFIRE VICTIMS IN UTILITIES. WE HAVE TO HOLD UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE ARE WORKING TO MAKE VICTIMS FALL IN THIS IS A DIRECT IN TIMELY SOLUTION FOR THOSE IMPACTED BY WILDFIRE. WE WEREN'T PREPARED FOR THE LAST PASSED CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES LET'S NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN. MEMBERS THE FACE OF THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE THOSE OF THE VICTIMS THE GOAL FIRST AND FOREMOST OF ANY WILDFIRE FUND SHOULD BE TO PROTECT ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE VICTIMS.

ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAVID CHIU AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY THE TENDENCY. MR CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER COLLEAGUES. IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY MILLIONS OF OUR CALIFORNIA TENANTS ARE ONE RENT INCREASE AWAY FROM BEING ABLE TO AFFORD FOOD. HEALTH CARE OR BECOMING HOMELESS. AND WE'VE HEARD TOO MANY STORIES OF TENANTS WERE FACING RENT HIKES OF OVER 15% 25% FIFTY OR A AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE SOLUTION. IT'S NOT RENT CONTROL BUT IT'S AN ANTI RENT GOUGING POLICY DESIGNED TO PROTECT MANY OF OUR STATES FIFTEEN MILLION TENANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE RENT CONTROL. AGAINST THE MOST EGREGIOUS RENT INCREASES WHILE ALLOWING LANDLORDS TO MAKE A FAIR RETURN ON INVESTMENT. WE'VE ENGAGED IN MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION. AND AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT AS OF SIX OH SEVEN PM TONIGHT. THE COALITION SUPPORTING MY BILL AND THE JUST BECAUSE BILL AUTHORED BY OUR COLLEAGUES FROM CONCORD IN OAKLAND. HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT ON AMENDMENTS TO BOTH BILLS THAT WE WILL BE DRAFTING AND AMENDING IN THE SENATE. FLORAL ART IS BEING CIRCULATED TO YOU AS WE SPEAK BUT I WANT TO READ THE FOR DEAL POINTS OF AGREEMENT. BETWEEN OUR COALITION IN THE REALTORS ON OUR BILL. FIRST THE BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A RENT CAP OF 7%. PLUS REGIONAL CPI WHICH IS UP FROM CPI PLUS 5%. THE BILL WOULD EXEMPT SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS WITH TEN OR FEWER SINGLE FAMILY DETACHED HOMES. IT WOULD ESTABLISH A SUNSET DATE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH IS A THREE YEAR SUNSET DATE. AND WOULD CLEAN UP LANGUAGE ON VACANCY TO CONTROL OR MAKE OTHER TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WONDER ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE CPI PLUS SOME PERCENT CAP. WITH AN ANNUAL AVERAGE CPI INCREASE OF TWO AND A HALF PERCENT THE RENT GOUGING CAP WOULD AVERAGE BETWEEN NINE AND A HALF AND 10%. IT'S BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DATA POINTS FIRST FOUR HUNDRED FORTY YEARS STATE LAWS PROHIBITED PRICE GOUGING ABOVE 10% AFTER AN EMERGENCY OR NATURAL DISASTER. SECONDLY THIS IS A PRECEDENT FOR STATEWIDE ANTI RENT GOUGING MEASURES SET JUST EARLIER THIS YEAR IN OREGON. THIRD FEDERAL DATA SHOWS THAT THIS LEVEL CPI PLUS 7% IS ON AVERAGE A HUNDRED AND 50% HIGHER THAN THE ANNUAL MEDIAN RENT INCREASE IN OUR STATE'S LARGEST REGIONS. AS SUCH WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A LEVEL TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO CALIFORNIA RENTERS SO THAT THEY WON'T RECEIVE AN EXORBITANT RENT INCREASE WHILE ALLOWING PROPERTY OWNERS TO MAKE A HEALTHY RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AND RESPECT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHIU MISS WORKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. WHEN I GOT ELECTED ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID IN JANUARY AS I DID A LISTING CHORE -- AT ALL THAT HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS OF MY DISTRICT NOT ALL OF THEM THERE ARE MANY BUT I WENT TO A COUPLE I WENT TO ONE IN BERKELEY. ONE AND OPEN AND ONE IN RICHMOND. AND I TALKED TO A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND THESE ARE JUST HEART BREAKING STORIES WHEN YOU TALK TO FOLKS WHO ARE SLEEPING OUTSIDE EVERY NIGHT. AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF THE INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS TO THE THE HOMELESSNESS COUNTS JUST CAME BACK IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WE'VE WE'VE SEEN A 43% INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS. AND I'M SURE THAT'S REFLECTED IN MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS AS WELL. THE DATA ALSO SHOWS THAT DATA SHOWS THAT OVER HALF OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ECONOMICALLY DISPLACED. WE ALL BELIEVE. THAT WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS. AND I KNOW THAT PART OF THAT SOLUTION IS BUILDING MORE HOMES AND I'VE BEEN A PROPONENT OF A LOT OF THE PRODUCTION LEGISLATION I'M CHAMPING PRODUCTION WITH THIS LEGISLATION MYSELF. THE SOLUTION ALSO WAS GUARDING AGAINST DISPLACEMENT. IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THIS BODY TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO STOP THIS HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND THAT'S WHY MEASURES LIKE THIS THIS IS A MODERATE. COMMONSENSE BILL AND IS A CO AUTHOR I'VE SPENT TIME WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO WHO WAS. WORKED COLLABORATIVELY ACROSS. THE SPECTRUM ON THE SAT DOWN WITH ALL PARTIES TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL THAT WE CAN ALL BELIEVE AND WE CAN ALL SUPPORT. THIS HAS A SUNSET IT'S ONLY FOR THREE YEARS. LANDLORDS CAN STILL INCREASED CHOOSE AND I'VE TALKED TO ALSO A LOT OF MOM AND POP LANDLORDS IN MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO THEY DON'T. HAVE PENSIONS ARE RETIREMENTS ARE FOR ON CASE. THEY OWN A HOUSE THAT THEY RENT OUT OR UNIT OR TWO THAT THEY RENT OUT AND THAT'S THEIR INCOME THAT'S A RETIREMENT INCOME. THEY CAN STILL INCREASE RENTS EVERY SINGLE YEAR IT'S A VERY MODERATE MEASURE THAT WILL GUARD AGAINST SOME OF THE MORE EGREGIOUS PRACTICES THAT WERE SAYING. THAT 203-040-5060 PERCENT INCREASES THAT WERE SAYING IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT IS CAUSING THE DISPLACEMENT THAT WE SEE. SO I'M PROUD TO CALL FOR THIS BILL. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS WICKS MISS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER YOU. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER -- QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR THAT OBJECTION. WHAT IS RENT CONTROL? RENT CONTROL IS WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE IN SOME CITIES IN OUR STATE THAT. HOLD RENT TO ASK OR BELOW INFLATION THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS BILL IS HOW WE ADDRESS RENT GOUGING SO. IF YOU'RE AT CPI PLUS 7% YOU HAVE AN ABILITY TO MAKE A HEALTHY RETURN IF YOU ASK FOLKS FROM THE INDUSTRY -- BUT YOU'RE ALSO ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR PREVENT SOME OF THE MORE EXORBITANT RENT INCREASES AND PROVIDE SOME PREDICTABILITY TO TENANTS. TWO VERY DIFFERENT ANSWERS I THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. SO ON MY OWN TIME -- RENT CONTROL IS THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLLING AND REGULATING RENT. WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES. YOU CAN SAY IT'S NOT RENT CONTROL ALL DAY LONG BUT IT IS AND YOU KNOW IT IS. AND WHEN YOU PUT RENT CONTROL. IN THE PLACE THEN. YOU THIS IS A DISINCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO BUILD. AND WHAT WE NEED IS TO BELT. EVERYBODY IN HERE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE HOMELESS CRISIS OH MY GOD IT'S SO TERRIBLE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. AND THEN WE COME UP WITH THIS. THIS DOES NOT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BILL. YOU'RE GOING TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF UNITS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THAT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE NEED. THIS IS RENT CONTROL I DON'T CARE HOW YOU SAY IT I DON'T CARE HOW YOU SPEND IT THIS IS RENT CONTROL AND YOU KNOW AND YOU'RE GOING TO HARM. THE VERY PEOPLE THAT NEED THE HELP THE MOST. I WOULD URGE YOU KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU MISS MENDEZ MISS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I AM OF BEING REALLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS BILL I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I RENT INVOLVED IN PARK I'VE BEEN IN MY PLACE. FOR NINE YEARS NOW MY RENTS STARTED AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH MY RENT NOW IS SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH I DID THE MATH AT JUST THE BASIC 5%. IF THAT RENT CONTROL OR THE 5% WAS IN PLACE -- MY A RATE WOULD BE AT ALMOST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH NOW. IF THE MY LANDLADY DECIDED TO INCREASE MY RENT 5% NOW THERE ARE SOME REPUTABLE -- LAND LORDS THAT ARE NOT GOING -- TO INCREASED RENT BUT I ASTOR. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SHE -- WAS NOW ABLE TO DO 5% AND SHE SAYS I WOULD HAVE TO RAISE IT 5% BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO RAISE IT LATER. SO MY CONCERN FOR MY COMMUNITY IS THAT YES RIGHT NOW YOU'RE CAPPING AT A 5% FOR THOSE. ARE A REPUTABLE -- AND MAINLY THE HOUSE PRICE GOUGING IS REALLY IN SAN FRANCISCO LA SAN JOSE THE REALLY HIGH PRICE AREAS IN MY COMMUNITIES. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY I'M SURE THERE'S SOME BITE IF. THEY HAVE A LICENSE NOW TO RAISE THE RENT 5% THEY WILL BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND AND SO MY CONCERN IS THAT SOME OF MY FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE PRICED OUT. OF THEIR HOMES THERE RENTALS IN THREE TO FIVE YEARS WHICH REALLY IS GOING TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO I THINK THAT WE ARE. REALLY DOING A DISSERVICE TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OF LOWER INCOME I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES IN SANTA MONICA SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE. BUT IN MY COMMUNITY. IT IS NOT THE CASE SO I AM REALLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT HOW WE VOTE TODAY BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S GOING TO IT. OF REALLY PRICE OUR FOLKS LOW INCOME FOLKS I DON'T HOUSING BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IN FIVE YEARS THEY WON'T BE ABLE. TO AFFORD OF 5% INCREASE EVERY YEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS RUBIO. MR LIVING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ARE RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATION TODAY THIS IS A COMPROMISE AND I I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR THE AUTHORS TO WORK SO HARD TO GET TO THE POINT THAT WERE AT I WISH I COULD SAY THAT THIS IS THE DEAL. THAT WE NEED BUT THIS IS A COMPROMISE THAT WE NEED WE HAVE HEARD THE WORD COMMUNITY SO MUCH TODAY. AND ONE THING THAT WE HAVE SEEN AS THE ECONOMY HAS GOTTEN SO HOT FOR SO FEW IN CALIFORNIA THAT PRICES HAVE JUST GOTTEN EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH FOR PEOPLE. AND THE RENT HAS GONE UP WITH THAT AND WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE PRICED OUT OF THE HOMES AND OUT OF THE APARTMENT THAT THEY LIVED IN FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND WE'VE SEEN THE MIGRATION OF PEOPLE FROM THE COASTAL BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE OR THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA INLAND AS THEY'RE LOOKING TO FIND A PLACE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD. TAKING THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL LEAVING THE WORK IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN A PART OF AND THIS BILL IS A IS AN IMPORTANT PART. ABOUT KEEPING OUR COMMUNITIES HOLE AND RECOGNIZING THAT IN THIS WHITE HOT ECONOMY THAT WE ARE IN THAT WE CAN NOT. I OUT OF THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF SKY HIGH RENT INCREASES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONSIDERING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER LEVINE SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISTER CHIU YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER LET ME JUST MAKE A FEW QUICK POINTS AND RESPONSE TO THE DISCUSSION AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. EVERYONE'S ENGAGEMENT ON THIS FIRST OF ALL WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CPI PLUS 7% WHICH IS CLOSE TO EFFECTIVELY 10%. SO A SMALL PROPERTY OWNER SOMEONE OWNS RENT CAN'T OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS POTENTIALLY REYES RENT. AS WE DISCUSSED AS WITH MANY MEMBERS AND RENTAL HOUSING WORLD THAT IS ADEQUATE ROOM TO MAKE SURE YOU GET PROFIT BUT PROVIDE SOME PREDICTABILITY. TEAR TENANTS SECONDLY PRICE GOUGING IS HAPPENING NOT JUST IN URBAN AREAS IT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE STATE. AND RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE URBAN PARTS THE STATE COASTAL PARTS THE STATE INLAND PARTS THE STATE -- I KNOW THERE WAS A SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW WE DIDN'T CONSIDER INCENTIVES TO BUILD AND THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT THE CASE ONE ASPECT OF THIS BILL THAT WE DID NOT TALK ABOUT BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY EMBEDDED IN THE BILL. WHICH WE CARVE OUT A TEN YEAR EXEMPTION FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. TO ADDRESS THAT VERY POINT AND I WANT TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING TRADES FOR THEIR SUPPORT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT. THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS COLLEAGUES WE HAVE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE ONE RENT INCREASE AWAY FROM BEING FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOMES OF DECADES. THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBORS THERE ARE CO WORKERS THEY ARE BROTHERS AND SISTERS. THE OUR GRANDPARENTS. JUST THIS WEEK WE'VE ALL BEEN READING.
