THANK YOU SENATE MITCHELL MADAM PRESIDENT I KNOW YOU WERE TESTING ME I KNOW YOU WERE TESTING ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTY FIVE IS THE REVENUE BUDGET TRAILER BILL. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THE BILL DOES THE FOLLOWING THINGS THAT SUSPENDS INCOME TAX NET OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTIONS FOR TAXPAYERS WITH INCOME OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TAXABLE YEARS BETWEEN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY AND JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IT LIMITS THE USE OF ALLOWABLE TAX CREDITS TO OFFSET CORPORATE AND PERSONAL INCOME TAXES NO MORE THAN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TAXABLE YEARS BETWEEN AGAIN JANUARY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY IN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE BILL ALLOWS TAXPAYERS TO IN FUTURE YEARS UTILIZED IN THE NET OPERATING LOSSES OR TAX CREDITS. THAT THEY ARE PROOF THAT THEY ARE PREVENTED FROM USING DURING THE NEXT THREE YEARS AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL. IT EXEMPTS EVERY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIPS AND LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY IN ITS FIRST TAXABLE YEAR FROM THE PAYMENT OF THE ANNUAL MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX OF EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. CHOIRS USED CAR DEALERS TO RE MET SALES TAX TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION TO CLOSE THE EXISTING USED CAR SALES TAX GAP. BILL COMPONENT THE COMPONENTS OF THE BILL ARE ESTIMATED TO INCREASE GENERAL FUND REVENUE BY APPROXIMATELY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE BUDGET YEAR MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE CENTER NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE TO FIRST I OBJECT TO THE PROCESS. THERE'S BEEN NO TIME THE DIGEST AND KNOW WHAT THIS PARTICULAR DEAL MAY BE I ASSUME THERE IS AN AGREEMENT WITH THE MAJORITY AND THE GOVERNOR. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS IT IS NOT BEFORE US. ANOTHER CONSTRUCTIVE THAT THE FIRST BILL WE BRING UP IS A TAX INCREASE NOW THE NEW LEXICON IN A- DEMOCRAT DICTIONARY IS REVENUE. NOW THAT USED TO BE CALLED TAXES AND I WILL CONTINUE TO CALL IT WHAT IT IS IT'S TAXES. THEY ARE TAX INCREASES AS TO ONE OF THESE IT'S TO ROLL OVER INTO THE FUTURE AND YOU CAN ACCEPT THAT NONE OF FUTURE BUDGET. THERE'S NO HOPE THAT THAT CERTAINLY WERE HAPPEN. BECAUSE JUST LEGISLATURE HAS A- TERRIBLE HABIT. AS DO GOVERNORS. BUT NOT KEEPING THEIR WORD WITH THE VOTERS. WE MAKE A DEAL IT GETS RENEGED ON NEXT YEAR IT'S HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND A DHL REGARDING TAX INCREASES. AND A TAX INCREASE IN TAX INCREASES PEARL OR NOT THE WAYS. OUT OF OUR FISCAL DIFFICULTIES TODAY. THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN THIS BUDGET THAT ARE DECENT AND CONSIDERATION BUT NOTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE SUSTAINING INTO THE FUTURE. NO WE CAN COUNT ON THAT WILL KEEP OUR BUDGET SOUND. AND BALLOTS IN FACT EVEN DURING THE SO CALLED FAT TIMES OF LATE. I'LL ALWAYS ARGUED EVEN AT THAT THERE ARE BUDGET WAS PRECARIOUSLY BALANCED THE CRISIS OF THIS YEAR ONLY OF FIRMS THAT OBSERVATION. HOW QUICKLY IT COULD GO BACK. IT IT DID NEED TO BE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT WE NOW ARE SUFFERING. THE OTHER SIGNAL IS TO THE BUSINESSES OF CALIFORNIA. YOU'RE ALREADY TROUBLED. YOU'VE NOT KNOWN WHETHER YOU'RE EVEN GOING TO GET TO GO BACK IN BUSINESS AGAIN TO OPEN YOUR DOORS. AND AS EACH DAY PASSES BY. MANY OF THEM GET CLOSER TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WILL NOT OPEN UP AGAIN. AND THERE'S ALWAYS THE ASSUMPTION ORGAN ONLY TAX RICH. YOU'RE ALREADY THAT'S NEVER EVER BEEN SO. CERTAINLY THERE AMPLY TAXED. BUT KEEP IN MIND SOME OF WHO THE RICH ARE. IN CALIFORNIA. ALL THE ALL THE HIGH TECH BILLIONAIRES. SURE BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF THEM ARE. COUPLE. WHO SHOULD DRIVE AND START A BUSINESS ON TO ME WILL TAKE RISKS BLIGE THEMSELVES. BILL THAT BUSINESS ORDER TO PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE SUCCEEDING IN THEIR PROFESSIONS. AND HOW DO WE REWARD THEM LADIES AND GENTLEMAN WE INCREASE THEIR TAXES. AND THEN THE QUESTION MUST BE. WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE. RECEIVING THE EXTRA TAXES. THE DAY IN COURT. THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING P. Y. INCREASES HERE IN THE BUDGET PERSONNEL YEARS. AT SOME REALLY DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE. LIKE CONTINUING TO POUR MASSIVE DOLLARS BEHIND HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND ADDING ALLIES TO VARIOUS AND SUNDRY AGENCIES. NOW A LOT OF US HAVE HAD TROUBLE FOR EXAMPLE. WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT. SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE DISASTER THIS BEFALLEN THE CITIZENS BY THAT AGENCIES AND COMPETENCE. SO WHAT DO WE DO I THINK IT'S NOW SEVEN HUNDRED OR SO NEW PERSONALITY IT WAS ONCE A THOUSAND. THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE THEM. NOW I WILL MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS TO THE- REQUIRES GREATER SCRUTINY THAN THIS HAS BEEN A LOUD. FOR YEARS WE'VE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE ARM FOR THE PERSON. CONFISCATION OF WEAPONS THE FELONS HEAD STILL IN THEIR POSITION. AND EACH YEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WOULD REQUEST MORE MILLIONS. FOR MORE PERSONNEL. AND EACH YEAR. THOSE PERSONNEL. DID NOT GET HIRED. AND IN RESPONSE TO WE WERE TOLD WELL WE CAN'T COMPETE WITH PRIVATE ENTERPRISE. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE ATTORNEYS WE NEED. THEY PAY MORE. WHAT IS TO ASSURE US WITH THESE PARTICULAR P. WISE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. TO MAKE THE UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IMPROVED FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS WHERE ARE THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED GOING TO COME FROM. NOW THERE'S BEEN SOME TRANSFERRED INTO CHICKEN OR AGENCY WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO ANOTHER AGENCY. THE POINT BEING THROUGH ALL OF OUR TRIALS. PIECEWISE OF INCREASED. ANOTHERONE OF THESE THAT WILL BE INCREASING YET AGAIN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. WHAT AN IRONY HERE SO MANY CALLS FOR REALIGNMENT. AND THE DOWNSIZING. AND EVEN IN THIS BUDGET TO PRISONS WERE REPORTED TO BE CLOSE. OR MAYBE ONE. AND THE YOUTH AUTHORITY. PRETTY MUCH OF ITS DOORS SHUT IT. WHAT DID WE GET FOR THAT THE- AND THIS GOES BACK ALMOST FIVE YEARS. THE BUDGET THE CDC ARE DID NOT GO DOWN IT WENT UP. AND ONE FORMER SECRETARY AND I GIVE MUCH MORE CREDIBLE. EIGHT INCH TO THE CURRENT SECRETARY THAN THESE PREVIOUS ONES. BUT I WAS TOLD BECAUSE THE COURTS MADE US DO IT. WELL I CAN GIVE YOU A LONG DISSERTATION ABOUT THAT ISSUE. SUFFICE TO SAY THERE WAS NO IF YOU WILL PRESENT CLOSING DIVIDEND. OR CDC ARE REFORM DIVIDEND. IN FACT WHAT IT HAPPENED WE JUST THROUGH OUR PROBLEMS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD YOU DEAL WITH. IN FACT THAT'S PARTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE WITH THE YOUTH AUTHORITY NOW THERE'S SOME MONEY IN HERE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THIS BUDGET. AND THAT'S GOOD THE MOST OF US. WOULD NOT MIND THAT. BUT IT SHOULD BE COUPLED WITH. RELIEF FOR THE MANDATES ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE CLOSE IN ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE REST OF THIS BUDGET IS GOING TO GO. YET WE'RE- FOR MORE REVENUE TO START THE WHOLE DEBATE. MY FEAR IS AS USUAL THAT'LL BE REVENUE. GOES DOWN A DARK HOLE. IN ANOTHER YEAR. WILL BE ON THE PRECIPICE. OF ANOTHER DEFICIT BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT DONE THE JOB REQUIRED TO GET THIS BUDGET LONG TERM MULTI YEAR UNDER CONTROL I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM RESIDENT IN MEMBERS I WANNA JUST PREFACE THIS WITH I AM IN A COMMENT ON THIS BILL IN. SB SEVENTY FOUR SO THAT I WON'T HAVE TO GET UP AND I HAVE PREPARED MY COMMENTS FOR BOTH. AND THAT WILL DO IT WHAT WITH ONE. SENATE COMMENTS YOUR SITE IS ONE OF THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT- IT'LL MAKE IT SO I DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK AGAIN AND IT'LL- SPEED THE PROCESS UP. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT VOTE. IT WILL TAKE ALL YEAR THE BUDGET BILL. THIS DETERMINES THE PRIORITIES. OF WHERE CALIFORNIA WILL GO IN THE NEXT YEAR. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THE COVE IT. HAS SET US BACK. HOW FAR BACK. WE DON'T KNOW. BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD REAL NUMBERS. THIS PROCESS HAS ALLOWED US TO GET REAL NUMBERS WE SURELY HAVE THE TIME WE EVEN WORKED ON A SUNDAY I KNOW. BUT WE SHOULD HAVE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. THERE'S A GAME BEING PLAYED. TO GET MORE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I'VE ASKED SEVERAL TIMES IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEES HOW MUCH ARE WE GETTING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NO ONE CAN GIVE ME AN ANSWER. HOW MANY MILLIONS OR BILLIONS. THE QUESTION IS WHO FUNDS THE GOVERNMENT WHETHER IT'S STATE OR FEDERAL. WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM. WHO PAYS TAXES. BEFORE WE CAN HIRE ONE STATE EMPLOYEE. PRIVATE BUSINESSES WILL THAT WORK FOR THOSE BUSINESSES HAVE TO PAY A TAX FIRST. SO BEFORE WE HAVE HEALTHCARE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES A FIREFIGHTER A POLICE OFFICER A SCHOOL TEACHER. PRIVATE BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THOSE BUSINESSES. PAY TAXES FIRST. NOW TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE WERE IN A RECESSION IF YOU'LL RECALL. EVERY PASSED PROP THIRTY. TO AVOID CUTS TO EDUCATION. IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WE EXTENDED THAT TAX WITH PROP FIFTY FIVE WHICH ULTIMATELY HELP CREATE A SURPLUS. AND WE WERE GOING TO USE THIS BUDGET. IT WE'RE GOING TO USE YOU DO WITH THIS BUDGET IS WE'RE GONNA CUT EDUCATION. ISN'T THAT WHY WE SET UP A RAINY DAY FUND. NOW WHAT ARE THE REAL PRIORITIES IN THIS BUDGET. THE BUDGET WAS PUT TOGETHER BY A SMALL GROUP OF LEGISLATORS. HERE'S THE PRIORITIES THAT I FOUND IN THIS BUDGET. AB FIVE TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO ENFORCE AB FIVE. WHICH MEANS WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING AFTER BUSINESSES AGAIN. BETTER PRESIDENT PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION THIS IS A LETTER. FROM EDWIN LOMBARD WHOSE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ON THE FUTURE OF AB FIVE. BLACK WHAT MAKES BLACK FAMILIES AND BLACK BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE TRIPLE. CATASTROPHES OF AB FIVE COVERT NINETEEN AND VIOLENT RACISM THAT PERMIT PERMEATES THE VERY INSTITUTION WE ARE RELY WE RELY ON TO PROTECT OUR FREEDOMS AS AMERICANS. THE BLACK MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO WORK FOR THEMSELVES WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR YOUR PROTECTION. FROM SELF EMPLOYMENT WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR YOUR PERMISSION TO EARN A LIVING AS WE CHOOSE. BY STARTING A BUSINESS FOR OURSELVES OR CONTROLLING OUR OWN FUTURE AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. WE ARE TIRED OF THE. RITUALISTIC INSTITUTIONS THAT PURPORT TO PROTECT US WELL IN A BILLION DEPENDING. SEE THREE. DEFENDING PROPAGATING THE SYSTEMATIC RACISM THAT HAS COST SO MANY BLACK LIVES AB FIVE HAS ALREADY CRUSHED THOUSANDS OF BLACK BUSINESSES AND WE'LL KEEP MORE FROM OPERATING IN THIS GIG ECONOMY NEARLY A MILLION CALIFORNIANS WOULD LOSE JOBS OPPORTUNITIES AND INDEPENDENCE IF AB THE FUTURE OF AB FIVE WERE UP TO YOU. IF COOPER NINETEEN TAUGHT US ANYTHING IT IS THAT PEOPLE WHO LOST JOBS DURING THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN REALIZED. THEY COULD WORK FROM HOME AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. MAKE MORE MONEY AND SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR YOUR HELP OR MISGUIDED PROTECTIONS JUST OPEN THE DOOR AND LET US HELP OURSELVES SINCERELY MR LOMBARDI WHAT ELSE IS A PRIORITY IN THIS BUDGET. WE'RE GONNA CREATE SEVENTY NEW POSITIONS FOR THE HIGH SPEED TRAIN IT TOWARD. WE MAKE THESE CONTRACTORS STATE EMPLOYEES A HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS POSITION THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. LOOK LET'S. NOT KID OURSELVES THE HIGH SPEED TRAIN IS A BOONDOGGLE. WE NEED TO CUT OUR LOSSES AND MOVE ON BUT WE HAVE WHAT WE USE THINGS THAT DO BETTER THINGS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT LIKE FUND CAL FIRE AND FIRE SUPPRESSION. PUT MONEY TOWARDS ROADS IT REALLY NEED ATTENTION. WHAT ELSE IS A PRIORITY IN THIS. BUDGET ACTUALLY BILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW IT'S REVENUE WHAT IS REVENUE. REVENUE IS A TAX WHICH I EXPLAINED EARLIER ON PRIVATE PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES WHO PAY THEIR TAX FIRST. REVENUE IS SIMPLY ANOTHER NAME FOR A TAX INCREASE NINE BILLION OVER THREE YEARS FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION THIS YEAR. LAST WE WERE DOING LAST YEAR WE WERE DOING JUST FINE BUT THIS YEAR THEY ARE GOING TO SHOW A LOSS A LOSS THIS THAT THE STATE WILL LET THEM COUNT AGAINST THEIR TAXES. THAT'S A TAX INCREASE ON BUSINESSES ALREADY AFFECTED BY COBIT. THE SAME PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY PAID IN PROP THIRTY IN PROP FIFTY FIVE. IT IS TIME WE SHOW SOME RESPECT TO THESE BUSINESSES. FOR THE BUSINESSES AND THE WORKERS THAT PAY THE BILL. ANOTHER PRIORITY IN THIS BILL FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND HEALTHCARE TO IMMIGRANTS HERE ILLEGALLY. SIXTY FIVE MILLION. TO EXPAND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT TO IMMIGRANTS HERE ILLEGAL. TEN MILLION IN BUSINESS GRANTS FOR IMMIGRANTS HERE ILLEGAL. WHAT ABOUT THE BUSINESSES. THAT HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THAT HAD TO SHUT THEIR DOORS BECAUSE OF COVERT. THAT HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR PROP THIRTY PROP FIFTY FIVE. YOU KNOW A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. THERE WERE SOME TWEETS BACK AND FORTH. ABOUT THE OWNER OF TESLA YVONNE MASKUN PLACE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT PAY TAXES IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SERVICES AND ONE OF THE LEGISLATORS IN THIS FAMILY SAID AB YOU YOU CAN GET OUT OF CALIFORNIA. STOP THE PRIORITY. THAT I THINK IS MISGUIDED MEMBERS I LONG FOR THE DAY THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY FUNDED THIS GOVERNMENT GET THE RESPECT FROM THE LEGISLATURE THEY DESERVE. I HAVE A VISION OF A DAY THAT WE SIT DOWN WITH REAL FACTS. REAL NUMBERS REAL SOLUTIONS. THIS PROCESS HAS FAILED US. SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET. ARE YOU REALLY REPRESENTING THE MILLION PEOPLE CONSTITUENTS IN YOUR DISTRICT. FOUR FIVE PEOPLE HAVE SAT DOWN. AND THEY WROTE THIS BUDGET THEY'VE TAUGHT THEY'VE PICKED WINNERS AND LOSERS IN YOUR DISTRICT WITH PHONY NUMBERS. NO WAY OUT I WOULD EVER SUPPORT THIS BUDGET. FOR THE PROCESS. AND YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER. I URGE NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR GROVE. THEPRESIDENT I TO RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS- BUDGET TRAILER BILL- EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE AND- THE REASON WHY IS A SIMILAR TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE TO SAID FROM BEAVER- WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND CALLING SET THE PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE PRIVATE JOBS ARE THE ONLY SOURCE OF REVENUE NOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT SAY I PAY TAXES FOR MY EMPLOYEES IN THIS BUILDING PAY TAX. BUT THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THAT INCOME COMES FROM THE PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR WHEN YOU LOOK T OVER THAT ARE GENERATED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT FUND GOVERNMENT IT COMES FROM PERSONAL INCOME TAXES PAID FOR BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU GUYS MIGHT ALL SAY WELL AGAIN I PAY TAXES BUT THINK ABOUT THAT YOUR ORIGINAL CHECK COMES FOR PRIVATE BUSINESS. AGENCIES MIGHT SAY WELL WE ONLY GET A PORTION OF OUR MONEY FROM THE GENERAL FUND BUT THE OTHER PART OF THEIR MANY THAT IS GENERATED IS GENERATED BECAUSE THEY SEE THE PRIVATE SECTOR. FOR THIS TO BE PRESENTED AS FIRST BUDGET TRAILER TO BE TAXING TO IS ON THE PRIDE SECTOR IS ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE OF INTERSTATE HOME ORDER BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN ARE OPERATING AT A DIMINISHED CAPACITY FOR THREE AND A HALF MONTHS OR JUST OVER THREE MONTHS THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE ABILITY TO OPERATE FULLY AND NOW THEY'RE GOING BACK OPPORTUNITY DIDN'T CAPACITY AND- NEW RIGHT TORY GOT. SUBJECT TO KOBE NINETEEN. THESE PEOPLE HAVE LAW A TON OF RED EMPLOYEES HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND WE NEED TO BE SUPPORTIVE ABOUT BRINGING BACK THE PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR IF WE CAN'T HAVE A VIABLE AND OF A VIABLE IN A SUCCESSFUL PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR THERE IS NO WAY WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS ECONOMIC SITUATION OF A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN. THIS YEAR THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS HEY WE'LL GIVE YOU EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS CREDIT FOR A ONE YEAR US SECRETARY OF STATE SERVICE FEE AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE YOU FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS THE FIRST YEAR AND NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF TOTAL OF THREE YEARS I THINK ANY BUSINESS OWNER THAT HAS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET RIGHT. WITHOUT STEALING FROM SOMETHING ELSE DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY BUT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE MONEY IN THE BANK TO COVER THE BILLS THAT THEY HAVE SET FORTH FOR THE NEXT YEAR IN ORDER TO OPERATE IN THIS STATE OR NATION FOR ANY. FOR FACT. IF THEY BALANCE THEIR BUDGET CORRECTLY THEN THEY WILL KNOW THAT THEY CAN EXCHANGE FOR EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS SECRETARY IT TAKES STATE TAX FILING IT'S COMPLETELY A ROD DEAL. WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO CHARGE THEM WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION FOUR POINT. ALORS OVER THREE YEARS. LET'S LOOK AT THE- ISSUES THAT ARE FACING OUR BUSINESSES WHICH WE VITALLY NEEDED IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING SURE GOVERNMENT IS FUNDED. NOT ONLY LIKE I SAID OF THE OPERATING A DIMINISHED CAPACITY. OR OPERATING NOT OPERATING AT ALL AT THIS POINT FOR SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES. THEY ARE RIGHT NOW STRUGGLING WITH THESE GUIDELINES IN THE LIABILITY THAT THEY FACE SO EVEN IF THEY OPEN AT A DIMINISHED CAPACITY. THERE IS THE FEAR OF THE LIABILITY EXPOSURE TO PAGO WITH THESE TRIAL ATTORNEYS. THAT ARE GOING TO RUN AROUND AND START SUING EVERYBODY- REGARDING A COVERT INFECTIONS OR ANY TYPE OF OTHER ISSUE THAT'S GOING ON IN OUR STATE. THIS BILL RIGHT HERE TO DO IN EXCHANGE FOR A SIMPLE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS OR- TO. CAP THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR TAX CREDIT WE CAN GO TO THAT SUBJECT MATTER WE NEED A LARGE BUSINESSES TO INVEST IN OUR STATE. AND IF I WAS A LARGE BUSINESS AND I OPERATED ANYWHERE IN THE STATE IS IN THIS NATION. AND I WANTED TO INVEST I DON'T KNOW TWENTY MILLION LET'S JUST CALL IT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN BUSINESS IS BUILDING. BUILT IN MY BUSINESS AND BUILDING A FACILITY A STRUCTURE REVAMPING A STRUCTURE PUTTING IN NEW MANY FACTS LINE FOR TRACK BRING THAT FROM BECAUSE THAT. LESS WE LEARN FROM NINETEEN THE CHINA CONTROL EVERYTHING. OUR THE THING WE WANT INVEST WE- TELL. ONCE INVEST THAT MILLIONS OR BILLION OF DOLLARS IN TO PRE JOB IN THIS OF CALIFORNIA. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A CAP OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TAX CREDIT. WHY TO INVEST ALL OF THAT MANY TO EMPLOY PEOPLE IN THIS CALIFORNIA. TO PAY CASH. THOSE WITH HIS IT THEN HAVE JUST FIVE MILLION TEN CREEK A PLOT. THERE'S NO WAY THEY'LL GO TO ANOTHER STATE. WE CALIFORNIAN STOP BEING SO HOT. BUSINESS GOT. TO BE ABLE TO WE URGE THEM TO WE'VE TO ENCOURAGE TO GET THE TO BE AS YOU PULL SO THAT THEY CAN EMPLOYEE AND STATING GET EVERY OP. FOR PEOPLE TO EMPLOYED IN PAID SO THE WE CAN GOV BUT TO DO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS THE FIRST BUDGET BILL THAT COMES INTO THIS BUILDING ON THIS SENATE SIDE IS TAX INCREASES ON THE PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR GROW. SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON. IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL AB EIGHTY FIVE JUST A COUPLE THOUGHTS ONE IS THAT IT'S NICE THAT- WE ARE EXEMPTING NEW NON CORPORATE BUSINESSES FROM THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR MINIMUM. FRANCHISE TAX IT'S BEEN GOING ON. LONG AS I'VE BEEN PRACTICING- CORPORATIONS PAY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. EVERY YEAR REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE TAXABLE INCOME ARE NOT. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE DISCUSSED- OVER TIME EVEN LAST YEAR WITH THE BILL FROM. SENATOR FROM PASADENA WHO TRIED TO DO SOMETHING WITH THIS WITH SMALL BUSINESSES. WE SHOULD RE LOOK AT MAYBE EVEN ELIMINATING IT ALL. JUST SO WE CAN INCENTIVIZE BUSINESSES TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD- THERE WOULD BE A NICE GESTURE. THIS SOME THREE YEAR SUSPENSION OF THAT ARE BRING LOS DEDUCTION IS SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO CHAT ABOUT A LITTLE BIT SINCE I HAD CLIENTS THAT HAD NET OPERATING LOSSES AND- THEY'RE NOT PLEASANT IT MEANS YOU. ACTUALLY HAD TO GO INTO DEBT OR YOU. REDUCE YOUR RESERVES DRAMATICALLY TO. SUBSIDIZE A TOUGH YEAR. AND SO YOU GET TO CARRY THAT LAS BACK HOPEFULLY GET A REFUND OR YOU CAN CARRY IT FORWARD AND OFFSET FUTURE REVENUES- IT'S A FAIR PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND BUSINESS OWNERS TO WORK TOGETHER- DURING GOOD TIMES AND IN BAD TIMES- BUT TO DEFERRED FOR A FEW YEARS MANGER ASSUMING THAT THE BUSINESS WILL STILL BE IN BUSINESS FOR THREE OR MORE YEARS- THAT'S NOT VERY COMFORTING. THE THRESHOLD IS ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL REVENUES THAT IS NOT A HIGH THRESHOLD THAT. HERE ARE JUST A SMALL CPA PRACTICE WITH A PARTNER TO YOUR YOU'RE GONNA BE OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN GROSS REVENUES AND FEES AND BUILDINGS- SO IT'S GOING TO CAPTURE A GOOD GOOD AMOUNT OF OUR BUSINESSES HERE IN. CALIFORNIA AND THAT THAT IS NOT A GOOD GESTURE AS WERE TRYING TO DIG OUT FROM CORONA VIRUS. ALSO THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT- WE SHOULD BE REAL CAREFUL NOT TO ABUSE THAT AND PUT THAT ON SUSPENSE AS WELL. SO WHAT HAPPENS AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID AND I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT BUT WE'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT MIGRATION OUT- IF WE MAKE THE CLIMATE. TO HOSPITAL FOR GOOD BUSINESS PEOPLE- THEY HAVE OPTIONS AND THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING THOSE OPTIONS AND WE ARE. JUST TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE IRS MAILING ADDRESS CHANGES OF WHO'S MOVED FROM CALIFORNIA TO WHAT STATES AND VICE VERSA. AND SO WE'RE SEEING A MIGRATION TO STATES LIKE TEXAS AND- NEVADA AND WE'VE GOT TO SOMEHOW MAKE. EFFORTS TO. DECREASE AND TURN THAT AROUND. SO MADAM PRESIDENT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. BUT IF WE'RE GONNA TAX A LITTLE BIT FOR EVERY TIME. WE'RE NOT MAYBE MAKING ENOUGH CUTS. THEN WE DON'T HAVE FAR TO GO WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT THE HIGHEST INCOME TAX RATES. PROBABLY THE HIGHEST CORPORATE RATES HIGHEST GAS TAX RATES HIGHEST SALES TAX RATES WE WERE IN WITH PROP THIRTEEN IRONICALLY WERE ACTUALLY ALMOST AT THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION OF PROPERTY TAX RATES SO. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH MORE ROOM TO PUSH SO WITH THAT COLLEAGUES I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND A NO VOTE ON AB EIGHTY FIVE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK CENTREBOARD JUST. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I WON'T BELABOR SOME OF THE POINTS THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY MADE. BUT I THINK MY BIGGEST CONCERN WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY IS THAT THERE IS A PROCESS PROBLEM. IN THE PROCESS PROBLEMS IS. WE ARE MOVING ON BUDGET ITEMS AND WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF. IN WHICH WE'RE OPERATING WHAT I WILL BE MORE SPECIFIC IF YOU WERE TO GO TO A BANK FOR A LOAN OR IF YOU WERE TO HAVE OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ANY NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD BE ASSISTING YOU WOULD NATURALLY ASK WHAT IS YOUR REPAYMENT PLAN. NATURALLY WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS PLAN FOR SUCCESS- GETS COMMONSENSICAL ENQUIRIES ON WHETHER OR NOT WHAT YOU'RE PURSUING IS FISCALLY PRUDENT. MY ISSUE HERE IS. WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH OUT A STATE PLAN. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THE GOVERNOR AND THE RESPECTIVE LEADERS IN BOTH HOUSES THAT. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE TRAILER BILLS IN THE LARGER BUDGET WITHIN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AGENDA OF CALIFORNIA. OTHER SHOULD BE THREE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT- AS LAWMAKERS AND IDEALLY FROM FOLKS IN THE EXECUTIVE SIDE OF THINGS. WHAT IS OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN TO GET US OUT OF OUR IMPENDING DIFFICULTIES. TWO WHAT ARE THE EXPECTED OVERHEAD CUTS THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD OF COURSE THREE WOULD BE THE TAX DISCUSSION. WITHOUT IN ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN. THAT INCLUDES THESE THREE ITEMS WE ARE CERTAINLY PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. NOW IF YOU'RE ASKING FOR NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX INCREASES WHERE S THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PART OF THE PLAN. WHERE ARE THE CUTS THAT WOULD NATURALLY BE EXPECTED IF WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL. SO COLLEAGUES. I WILL GET INTO EVERYTHING THAT WAS DISCUSSED PRIOR TO MY COMMENTS HERE BUT SHOULDN'T WE BE ASKING THE GOVERNOR FOR IN ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN. SHOULDN'T WE BE ASKING OR LEADERS IN BOTH THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY. NOT JUST BE THE BIG THREE BUT THE BIG FIVE. TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT ALL THE VOICES THAT ARE RELEVANT IN THE PROCESS FOR AT LEAST ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE. BECAUSE AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW WE RE THROWING MONEY AT A PROBLEM WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND. AND I THINK TO DO TO DO IT IN THIS FASHION IS FISCALLY IMPRUDENT IT'S NOT SMART IT CERTAINLY NOT RESPONSIBLE IN WE CAN DO THINGS BETTER. I'M NOT ASKING I THINK FOR A LOT BUT IT IN ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN. IS ESSENTIAL FOR US NOT JUST IN THIS BUDGET BUT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BECAUSE TO MAKE DECISIONS WITHOUT IT I THINK IT'S JUST TOSSING MONEY WITHOUT- COMMENSURATE CUTS IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STIMULUS- IN MIND. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU WERE SENATE PRESIDENT WAS INTENDING TO SPEAK BUT I WAS LISTENING CLOSELY. TWO ARMED OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. AND I WANTED TO RESPOND I THINK CONTEXTUAL E. AS TO WHERE WE ARE. AS TO WHAT WE'VE DONE HISTORICALLY AND WE'RE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT YOU GOT MY ATTENTION. FIRST AND FOREMOST IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE GDP IN CALIFORNIA JUST LOOKED UP WAS ONE POINT FOUR TRILLION THANK. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN ONE POINT NINE TRILLION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWO POINT NINE TRILLION AND TODAY. THREE POINT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS. SO WE'RE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT AT SOME LEVEL. THE QUESTION. NUMBER TWO IS THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT'S THIS REVENUE COMES FROM BUSINESSES NO QUESTION. BUT THERE IS A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA IN A RICH POOR DIVIDE. WHERE WE HAVE THESE EXTRAORDINARY NUMBERS AND PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE SIZE OF OUR ECONOMY COMPARED TO OTHER GLOBAL ECONOMIES. BUT THERE'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE WE HAVE SOME OF THE POOREST FOLKS WHO WERE CHALLENGE TO THE GREATEST LEVEL AND WE HAVE SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE THE MOST DYNAMIC AND THE RICHEST. WHICH INFORMS OUR THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR GDP. IT SHOWS WE SIT DOWN AND BE RESPONSIBLE AND THOUGHTFUL LEADERS WITH RESPECT TO CRAFTING A BUDGET. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU DO IT NOW I THINK IT WAS NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN PETE WILSON CUT A DEAL WITH JERRY BROWN THAT WOULD JERRY BROWN WITH PETE WITH A- WILLIE BROWN. AND ARE YOUNGER BROTHER. A END TO THEY DID SAY BILL IN CUTS SEVEN IN INTACT. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE LARGE MARKETS. WE DON'T KNOW. WHAT WHAT THE FEDERAL GONNA DO UNDER. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE STATE CAN. HAS A PRETTY HAD A PRETTY HEALTHY. ETHICS RATE A FUN THAT WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY RAINY DAY FUND FOR SOCIAL SPECIAL SIR I MEAN FOR SAFETY NET SUPPLEMENTED BY A FURTHER. A SAFETY NET FOR EDUCATION ALL OF WHICH HELPS CREATE A LARGER DYNAMIC. AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT TO FACE AFTER WE GET PAST THIS BUDGET. AND START THINKING ABOUT WHAT ECONOMIC RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY THAT WILL ATTRACT. BUSINESS AND THE LIKE. I THINK THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AS WE HAVE SOUGHT. TO CRAFT BUDGETS WHY THIS APPROACH IS SO INTELLIGENT. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS WOULD YOU LIKE IT OR NOT WHEN YOU CUT SERVICES TO FOLKS. YOU DON'T ELIMINATE THE NEED PEOPLE ARE STILL HUNGRY THIS DOING TO BE HOUSE YOU SO ABOUT THE SORTS OF PROBLEMS. YOU CAN'T. TAKE A BUDGET AND JUST OBLITERATED AND JUST CUT EVERYWHERE EVERY DOLLAR AFFECTS HUMAN BEINGS AND HUMAN LIFE A ROOF OVER SOMEBODY'S HEAD NICHE CATION FOOD IN THEIR MOUTH. BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY. WHICH PORT DIVIDE THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THAT ALTHOUGH THIS THERE IS THIS ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CARRY FORWARDS IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LARGE DYNAMIC OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HOW WE'RE TRYING TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND CONSERVATIVE ON THE ONE HAND BUT YET NOT BECAUSE A WHOLE HOST OF FOLKS FOLKS BRICK PROBLEMS. THAT YOU LOOK WHERE WE'VE GROWN WHERE WE'RE GOING AND WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN MY JUDGMENT. I AM IMPRESSED BY THIS BUDGET. I AM IMPRESSED BY THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES IN TERMS OF. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DIGNITY OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND I'M PROUD OF THAT WORK. AND SO I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET. AND I JUST YOU KNOW I AGAIN I WANT TO SHOW RESPECT TO ALL OPINIONS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT OUR JOB IS EVERYBODY HAS DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THEY REPRESENT. BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN THE BIG PICTURE. THIS REALLY IS AN APPROPRIATE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH AN EXTRA STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT NOW MAYBE IT'S BETTER IF WE JUST. SIT MICROSCOPE TOO HIGH SO I'M- CAN I WANT TO- SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE. LIKE ALL BUDGET ITEMS ESPECIALLY DURING A DEFICIT- I KNOW THAT MANY OF US MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THRILLED TO VOTE FOR SOME OF THE ITEMS BUT AGAIN BUDGET MAKING IS ABOUT PRIORITIES AND CERTAINLY REMEMBER. BEING HERE WITH- MANY OF MY- GOOD FRIENDS HERE- IN HOME WE CAME INTO THE LEGISLATURE SOME BEFORE. TWENTY TEN WHEN I CAME IN SOME OF. MY GOOD FRIENDS- HERE ALSO CAME AT THE SAME TIME WE HAD A TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT AND- WE HAD TO MAKE VERY HARD CHOICES. BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE NOTE AS WE APPROACH- NOT ONLY THIS BILL BUT THE OVERALL BUDGET. AS MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES- MENTIONED. ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA- PRIOR TO CALVET NINETEEN. WAS ACTUALLY- DESPITE. THE TAX INCREASES THE VOTERS PASS ON COUPLE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS WHICH GOT US OUT OF OUR LAST HOLE- DESPITE. OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE OF CRITIQUE IS BEING- BAD FOR OUR ECONOMY ACTUALLY HAD A CONDOM ME THAT GREW FASTER THAN MOST OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. WE CREATED MORE JOBS THAN MOST THE REST OF THE COUNTRY- AND SO. IN FACT CALIFORNIA OVERTOOK NOT ONLY OTHER STATES BUT OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD IN TURN DECIDES OF OUR ECONOMY. AND SO OVERALL I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT CALIFORNIA WAS AND ECONOMIC SUCCESS OVER THE PAST DECADE DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DIDN'T- HAVE PROBLEMS AND I THINK IT WAS NOTED ALSO BY. A GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES WE ALSO HAVE TREMENDOUS WEALTH DISPARITIES. BEFORE CODED WE WERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH ISSUES AROUND. HOUSING LACK OF HOUSING. OTHER TYPES OF NEEDS THAT- THAT WERE THERE. AS WELL AND THEN CERTAINLY COVERAGE SHOWED UP. NOW I WOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT WE HAVE THIS FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATING ARE ELLIE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT- DEFICIT BECAUSE- OF A- INFECTION THAT. NOT NOT ONLY LEAD TO A GOVERNMENT ACTIONS BUT ACTUALLY BECAUSE PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO GO OUTSIDE TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S BEHAVIORS. EIGHT N. FACT WE'VE LOST OVER- A HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICANS BECAUSE OF IT I THINK WE'RE APPROACHING FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS STEAD. EVEN THOUGH WE'VE DONE A MUCH BETTER JOB THAN MOST OF THE REST OF THIS COUNTRY IN ADDRESSING THIS IN FACT IF WE WANT TO TRY TO UNDO- WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH BECAUSE OF IT. OUR FIRST PRIORITY NEEDS TO BE SURE WEEK CONTAINING CONTROL THIS INFECTION SO I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT ALL OF. THE PEOPLE HERE WHO HAVE SAID THAT. WHAT THE PRIORITIES OF COURSE IS TO GET OUR ECONOMY GOING THINK ALL OF US HERE THAT THAT WE WOULD BE VIGOROUS ADVOCATES FOR SCIENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS. TO ADDRESS COLLUDED WITH SUCH AS WEARING MASKS TELLING PEOPLE TO PHYSICALLY DISTANCE. ARE THOSE ARE TWO THINGS. THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PREVENT FURTHER SPREAD OF THE DISEASE THAT WILL THEN ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE OTHER THING I'D ALSO POINT OUT IS THAT ECONOMIES ARE. BY CONSUMER SPENDING. AN ALMOST BUSINESS. AND I KNOW THAT WITHOUT CUSTOMERS MY BUSINESS WOULD NOT BE ABLE ARE ALWAYS MY WAIST BUSINESS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SURVIVE. AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY. WE ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. THE CUSTOMERS. SO WHO ARE THE CUSTOMERS WELL MANY OF THE CUSTOMERS ARE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY GET STATE ASSISTANCE. THEY'RE A SPENDING ACTUALLY DRIVES ECONOMIC ACTIVITY FOR OTHER BUSINESS FOR BUSINESSES TO SUCCEED SO. CERTAINLY WON'T DISAGREE THAT PRIVATE BUSINESS IS A VERY IMPORTANT SOURCE. OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT CONSUMER. ACTIVITY IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTUALLY GENERALLY APPROX ESTIMATE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF OUR ECONOMIC TV IN THE UNITED STATES IS DRIVEN BY CONSUMER ACTIVITY. AND SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT AS WE CRAFTER BUDGET HOW DO WE SUPPORT PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT NOT ONLY OF COURSE. WE WANT TO. ENSURE THAT THEY CAN LIVE IN DIGNITY THAT THEY ARE NOT IN NEED OF BASIC NECESSITIES. BUT ALSO THAT THEY'RE IN A POSITION TO ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY IT'S pCONSUMERS. AND SO I THINK WE ARE WE HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES- THERE CERTAINLY WHEN LOOKING AT THIS PARTICULAR BILL AROUND REVENUES. OTHER PRICE THING I WOULDN'T MIND PERSONALLY MAKING SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO BUT OVERALL. CERTAINLY I WOULD BE IN SUPPORT AND URGE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR. THIS BILL EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE AS- BASICALLY IT APPROACH TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN STRIKE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BUDGET. THAT WILL HELP SUSTAIN THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND TAKE A STEP TOWARD RESTORING CONTINUING OUR ECONOMY IN THE FACE OF A DEADLY PANDEMIC WHICH WE STILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB. EIGHTY FIVE OH IS NOT INTENDED AS BUT I DID WANNA SINCE THE DRESS ONE ISSUE THERE BEEN SOME COMMON. ABOUT CAN. WHO ARE NOT- DOCUMENTS. AND SOMEHOW SUPPOSEDLY TAKING RESOURCES WITHOUT GIVING WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING AT WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY- FALSE- WE KNOW THAT. ARE UNDOCUMENTED NEIGHBORS HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE NOT SAYS HANG OUT HERE THEY ARE WORKING. THEY'RE PAYING TAXES THEY'RE STARTING RUNNING SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEY ARE NOT CONTRIBUTORS- TO OUR ECONOMY AND OUR STATE- AND FEDERAL RESPONSE TO COVERED. BY JUST COMPLETELY SLICE AL AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING LIKE EVERYONE ELSE AND WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING ALL. CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER SERVER MELINDA. ON AGAIN THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM I JUST WANTED TO MAKE COMMENT RELATING TO THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE BY OUR CALL IN SO. TALK ABOUT. THE PHONE WHO WERE IN ON OUR SYSTEMS AND THAT SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW ARE SUBSIDIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. THAT WE ARE THERE FOR THEM I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE MONEY THAT IS. SPENT ON HELPING THOSE INDIVIDUALS COMES FROM. THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE TAXPAYERS IN WITHOUT THEM WITHOUT THEM RIDING WITHOUT THEM BEING ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND CONTINUE. KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN THERE WILL BE NO SUBSIDY FOR ANYONE. BEAR CODE. SAID JUST WANNA MAKE THAT DISTINCTION WHEN WE WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PHILANTHROPIC EFFORTS AT THIS LEGISLATURE AND HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY. BUT THAT MONEY DOES COME FROM SOMEONE. AND THAT SOMEONE NEEDS OUR HELP TO NOT JUST CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT BUSINESS COMMUNITY. WE NOTHING TO SPEND- I WOULD URGE IN ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MELINDA'S SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM. PRESIDENT OF MY COLLEAGUES SAID I THOUGHT YOU WERE TO SPEAK ONCE I HEARD YOU. BUT I WANT TO JUST RESPOND TO MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO. LOOK THERE'S NO DEBATE ON THE FACT THAT UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE. CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY. THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING. I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THEY PAY A TAX AND THEY THEY'RE PART OF OUR SYSTEM AND THEY AND THEY THEY DO PROVIDE THINGS WE NEED BUT THEY ALSO WHAT ABOUT THE% HEALTH CARE WE PROVIDE NOBODY'S DONE THE CALCULATIONS OR IS ABLE TO GIVE US A REAL NUMBER ON HOW MUCH IS PAID IN. AND HOW MUCH IS PAID OUT SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISONS ON THIS DEBATE. BUT WHAT MY COMMENT WAS WAS THAT. THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE LEGITIMATELY BEEN WORKING FOR GENERATIONS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY KOBE. CAN YOU RUN THE BRINK RIGHT NOW OF MAYBE NOT STAYING IN BUSINESS ANY LONGER. NEED A BREAK. THEY NEED SOME HELP DON'T DON'T TAKE AND PUT A TAX ON THEM THIS BILL DOES THAT. HI BUT LET'S LOOK AT THOSE FOLKS WHO. CONSISTENTLY HELPED OUR ECONOMY GROW TO THIS THREE POINT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS. THAT WAS MY POINT I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT THEY DO ADDED ECONOMY BUT THEY ALSO TAKE FROM OUR ECONOMY AND WE NEED REAL NUMBERS WHAT ARE WE PAYING. TOO UNDOCUMENTED THAT ARE USING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER. IS WHEN YOU GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM YOU GET SERVICE. NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FROM. IF YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT CLEAR. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY SENATOR BATES. MY ARE NOW I AM. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MEMBER OF AND I DO NOT BELIEVE I WOULD BUT THERE'S JUST A LITTLE FACTOID IN ALL OF THIS THE DISTURBS ME ON AND NOW HAS TO DO WITH OUR EMPLOYEES WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE WILL NEED FOR. INSURANCE WHY SETTLE FACT BECAUSE IN PLACE THERE ARE EMPLOYERS THERE AREN'T JOBS SO THIS SEEMS TO BE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ISSUE TAXING OR TAKING REVENUES FROM OUR BUSINESSES THAT ARE TRYING TO SURVIVE THE SURVIVOR THE SURVIVAL OF BUSINESSES SURVIVAL OF AN EMPLOYEE AND HIS INCOME TO HIS FAMILY AND CERTAINLY TO- WHAT HE CONTRIBUTES TO THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF GOODS AND SERVICES. SO IT JUST SEEMS ALMOST- INTELLECTUALLY. DATEABLE THAT YOU CAN TAX OF BUSINESS IN STEEL KEEP BILL THERE ARE SO P. HAVE A PLACE TO SO I WOULD ASK WE CONSIDER THAT WITH THIS VOTE I WOULD YOU KNOW VOTE ON FOR THE AND OF. WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON OF JOB BECAUSE THE BUSINESSES CAN NO LONGER SUSTAIN THEM THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. BATES SENATOR GROVE. MADAM PRESIDENT JUST ONE FINAL ON A APOLOGIZE FOR THIS TIME I KNOW WERE LOOKING AT A TIME SCHEDULE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT WITH FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNOR'S I'M STAY AT HOME ORDER. WE AGAIN NEED PRIVATE BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO PULL EMPLOYED. I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR CAP IN BUSINESS- IN THE TAXES THAT ARE IN THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT A MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT HARD TO ACHIEVE IF YOU ARE BILLING OUT AND HAVE A BUSINESS. SO TO LIMIT THAT AND ESPECIALLY THAT'S GROSS REVENUES. THAT IS A GROSS REVENUES MEANING YOU BILL OUT AND MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CAP ON YOUR TAX STRUCTURE RIGHT THERE YOUR INCOME STRUCTURE. THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO LIMIT. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT OUT OF THAT MILLION DOLLARS YOU DON'T PAY PAYROLL PAYROLL TAXES RENT I MEAN IF YOU THINK IF YOU HAVE A NICE BUILDING IN A DECENT PLACE FOR YOUR BUSINESS IT'S TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH RENT THAT'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR THAT MILLION DOLLARS SO NOW YOU'RE DOWN TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN YOUR TO READ BUT GROSSED ONE MALE. DO YOU HAVE FOR CAPITAL IN PAYROLL TO FIGHT YOU TO SEE DVD WORKERS COMP LIKE BILL INSURANCE OF THAT STUFF. PLUS OTHER INSURE. YOUR PROBABLY DOWN TO HUNDRED DOLLAR AND NOW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF NET RED. THEN YOU ADD A TIME P. G. OF LIKE. FEEL THE HIT BEEN FOR EMPLOYEE. THAT MILLION DISAPPEAR VERY QUICK SO NOW YOU'RE DOWN TO ABOUT THE SIXTY THOUSAND IN ACT NECK. READ THAT SHE HAVE IN ORDER TO KEEP TO INVEST OPERATING YOUR BUSINESS AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. NOW WHEN THIS BILL PASSES YOU'RE GOING TO PAY TAXES ON THAT MILLION DOLLARS. OUT OF THE MONEY YOU HAVE LEFT AFTER YOU'VE PAID FOR EVERY THING ELSE. IT'S NOT FEASIBLE AND IT DOESN'T WORK AS A BUSINESS OWNER IT DOES. WORK SO MANY CAR NEEDED GEN LEDGER LOOK AT THE EXPENSE IS NOT A THAT GENERAL READ. WERE YOUR- YOUR GROSS READ. ENDING YOU DID ALL THE G. IN A COST. OPERATING EXPENSES AND THEN HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON A GROSS REVENUE NUMBER THAT'S LIMITED OUT A MILLION DOLLARS. IS GOING TO EAT UP ANY AMOUNT THAT YOU HAVE LESS PLUS. YOU'LL MOST LIKELY HAVE TO BORROW TO PAY THE TAXES BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. WE NEED THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO SUCCEED. TO PAY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONSUMERS THAT GO INTO BUSINESSES TO PURCHASE STAFF ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE ON SUBSISTENCE ARE A- LIMITED INCOME. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY SURVIVE. AGAIN DEALING WITH KOBE NINETEEN THE ISSUES THE MORE REGULATORY PROCESSES IT THEY HAVE IN PLACE. THE NEW GUIDELINES OPERATING AGAIN A DIMINISHED CAPACITY AND NOT A FULL FORCE. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T PASS A BILL THAT INCREASES TAXES ON OUR PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR WHICH GENERATES ALL THE MONEY. THAT WE HAVE IN THIS BUILDING TO OPERATE ON INTO DISTRIBUTE OUT HOW THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY SEES FIT I AM RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO THE- THANK YOU SENATOR GROWTH. MA'AM SEEING NO FOR TO. OR DEBATE. SENATOR MITCHELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. MADAM PRESIDENT I WOULD OUGHT WHILE I APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGE OF OUR- SOCIAL DISTANCING IN ALL I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL BUDGET BILLS THAT WE FOCUS OUR TESTIMONY ON THE ISSUE AT HAND. ON I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US ALL TO FALLEN BE CLEAR WHAT YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON- I THINK THE CONVERSATION THE DEBATE GOT SO EXPANSIVE I WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE CLEAR WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN AB AT FOUGHT. THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO STAND UP THE PRESIDENT RECOGNIZED PEOPLE MORE THAN ONCE SO IF WE COULD FOCUS OUR TESTIMONY THE BILL AT HAND WHICH IS CUSTOMARY. WHEN WE PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION I'M NOT GONNA JUST THE BUDGET AS A WHOLE THAT'S NOT THE BILL BEFORE US I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT A. B. EIGHTY FIVE AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN IT. THIS BILL RAISES APPROXIMATELY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION IN HAS BEEN PART. A KEY PART OF THE BUDGET FRAMEWORK SINCE THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE. AND INCLUDED. IN THE SENATE VERSION OF THE BUDGET. NUMBER TWO THE TWO COMPONENTS THE NET OPERATING LOSS SUSPENSION IN THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR TAX CREDIT CAP. DEBT REYES MOST OF THE REVENUE OF THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION. LET'S BE CLEAR THEY ARE ACTUALLY DELAYS OF WHEN SOMEONE CAN UTILIZE THESE TAX BENEFITS. NOT TAX INCREASES. THREE WHO'S IMPACTED WE RECOGNIZE THAT EVERYONE IS HURTING THAT WE TALKABOUT THAT CONSISTENTLY INCLUDING BUSINESS HOWEVER TO BE IMPACTED BY THE NET OPERATING LOSS PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL YOU WOULD NEED TO HAVE INCOME OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE IN WHICH TO OFFSET LOSSES AGAINST. FOR THE TAX CREDIT CAP WANTING TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ESTIMATES GENERALLY A CORPORATION WOULD NEED TO HAVE INCOME OF OVER FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO BE AFFECTED ON A PERSONAL INCOME TAX PAYER WOULD NEED TO HAVE INCOME OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT'S THE WHO. LET'S BE CLEAR THE BUDGET THAT WILL COME BEFORE US WILL STILL CONTAIN CUTS. CUTS INCLUDING THIS BUDGET OF THE TRIGGER CUTS WILL IMPACT UCC ISSUE THE COURTS. AB STATE WORKER COMPENSATION REDUCTIONS. ALSO SIGNIFICANT SUSPENSIONS BUILT FROM THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET AGREEMENT THAT WILL CUT WELL OVER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FROM PROP FIFTY SIX IN IT ASSESS AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT IT WILL TAKE.

THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY SENATOR MITCHELL ARE YOU READY. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SB SEVENTY FOUR. SENATE BILL SEVENTY FOUR BY SENATOR MITCHELL AND AFTER LEADING TO THE STATE BUDGET TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BUDGET BILL. SENATOR MITCHELL MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH WHAT A DIFFERENCE SEVERAL MONTHS MAKES. IT WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY OF US IN JANUARY. THAT TO ALL OF YOUR BRIGHT IDEAS ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN YOUR DISTRICTS WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. ITNEVER OCCURRED TO ANY OF US IN JANUARY THAT WE'D BE STAND HERE WITH LITTLE SHOWER CAPS ON OUR MICROPHONES AND MATH. AND SOME OF YOU BEHIND PLEXIGLASS. TRYING TO DEBATE THE PEOPLE'S BUDGET AND YET HERE WE STAND. SB SEVENTY FOR THE BUDGET BILL FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. THIS BILL IS THE RESULT OF HARD WORK OVER THIS PAST MONTH IN THE MIDST OF GRAPPLING WITH. A PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC. WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC THAT IS CHANGED ALL OF OUR LIVES. BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS CALIFORNIA NOW FACES A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SHORTFALL AS WE APPROACH THE NEW FISCAL YEAR. THE BUDGET WE ARE PASSING TODAY REPRESENTS A TWO PARTY DEAL BETWEEN THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY. ALTHOUGH WE ARE WORKING HARD TO OBTAIN A THREE PARTY DEAL THAT INCLUDES THE ADMINISTRATION TODAY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PASS A BUDGET THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN. IN MEETING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE FOR PASSING A BALANCED BUDGET BY JUNE FIFTEENTH. THIS LEGISLATIVE BUDGET AGREEMENT CLOSES THE FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SHORTFALL BY FOLLOWING THE SAME REASONABLE FRAMEWORK SET FORTH IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION. WITH A MIX OF SPENDING REDUCTIONS. TEMPORARY NEW REVENUES BORROWING DEFERRALS EXISTING FEDERAL FUNDS USED RESERVE AN ANTICIPATED ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS. THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A TRIGGER COMPONENT SHOULD THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS NOT MATERIALIZE. THIS TRIGGER ESTABLISHES SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD NOT GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL OCTOBER FIRST IF THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS DO NOT COME IN. THESE TRIGGER SOLUTIONS INCLUDE THE USE OF ADDITIONAL RESERVES AND DEFERRALS AS A MEANS TO MINIMIZE PROGRAMMATIC REDUCTIONS. WE LEARNED IT TOUGH LESSONS DURING THE LAST DOWNTURN AND CUTS TO PROGRAMS THAT ARE STATES VULNERABLE POPULATIONS DEPEND UPON OFTENTIMES EXACERBATE THE PROBLEMS WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND TAKE PRECIOUS TIME EFFORT AND RESOURCES TO RESTORE THE PRIOR LEVELS. WE SPENT YEARS BUDGETING RESPONSIBILITY AND BUILDING A SIGNIFICANT RESERVE SPECIFICALLY TO AVOID THE PAINFUL ACTIONS THAT WE WERE FORCED TO TAKE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. AND ALTHOUGH NONE OF US ANTICIPATED THAT WE WOULD BE FACING A FISCAL CRISIS IS UNIQUE AND SEVERE AS WE ARE CURRENTLY FACING UTILIZING RESERVES AND OTHER TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE REDUCTION TO CRITICAL PROGRAMS IS THE RESPONSIBLE THING AS POLICY MAKERS TO DO. WITH THAT SAID I WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS LEGISLATIVE BUDGET AGREEMENT WITH IN THE BUDGET YEAR WITH MORE RESERVES OVER ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVIVE SHOULD WE RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS. THIS WILL INCLUDE THE MAINTENANCE OF OVER HALF OF THE MANDATORY DEPOSITS TO THE RAINY DAY FUND. AND ALL OF THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. IF THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS DO NOT MATERIALIZE AND THE TRIGGER SOLUTIONS GOING TO AFFECT. WE WOULD STILL IN THE BUDGET YEAR WITH HALF OF THE MANDATORY BALANCE OF THE RAINY DAY FUND AND TOLL RESERVES OF APPROXIMATING SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES TWO KEY DEADLINE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ANNUAL STATE BUDGET. ONE IT REQUIRES THE GOVERNOR TO PRESENT HIS BUDGET BY JANUARY TENTH EVERY YEAR. AND SECOND IT% REQUIRES THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS A BALANCED BUDGET BY JUNE FIFTEENTH. NOTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THE GOVERNOR THE ONLY PRESENT A BUDGET THAT THE LEGISLATURE AGREES TO. AND SIMILARLY NOTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THE LEGISLATURE TO ONLY PASS A BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS CONCURRED IN. AND JUST AS THE GOVERNOR MET HIS CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION ON JANUARY TENTH TODAY THE LEGISLATURE MEETS ITS CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION BY. HEARING AND HOPEFULLY PASSING THIS RESPONSIBLE BALANCE AND THOUGHTFUL BUDGET THEY CLOSES THE FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL AND KEEPS CALIFORNIA'S FINANCES IN SOUND CONDITION. WITH THAT MADAM PRESIDENT I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR ATKINS. MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND COLLEAGUES. LET ME JOIN THE BUDGET CHAIR AS I POINT OUT THAT THIS BUDGET IS ROOTED IN RESPONSIBILITY AND IT WAS CREATED WITH COLLABORATION AT ITS CORE. THE RESULT IS A PLAN THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO THE ECONOMIC REALITY THAT CALIFORNIA FACES AS A RESULT OF COVERT NINETEEN. AND IT PROTECTS THE PROGRAMS THE RESOURCES AND THE SAFETY NETS THAT SO MANY WORKING FAMILIES. RELY UPON AND NOW WILL RELY UPON EVEN MORE. WE ENTERED THISPROCESS WOULD LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PRIORITIES BETTER FAITHFUL TO THE PRAGMATIC FISCAL STRUCTURE. AS THE BUDGET CHAIRED NOTED THAT WAS PUT FORTH BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME IN HIS MAY REVISION. TOGETHER WE HAVE CRAFTED A BUDGET THAT NOT ONLY CLOSES A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET GAP. BUT AVOIDS THOSE DRACONIAN CUTS. AND PROVIDE STRONG FOOTING AS CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCES CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES THIS PLAN WILL PROTECT QUE FOR TWELVE AND HIGHER EDUCATION IT DOES OVER HEALTH CARE COST INCREASES FOR SENIORS. AND CUTS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE ONGOING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS REGARDING COMPENSATION FOR OUR STATE'S PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. MANY THAT WE ARE GOING TO COUNT ON IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME TO PROVIDE THOSE SAFETY NET SERVICES. OVER THE PAST DECADE WE'VE WORKED HARD TO BE IN A POSITION TO WEATHER. JUST SUCH A STORM. THIS BUDGET ENABLES US TO WHETHER IT RESPONSIBLY AND WITH PRECISION. SO THAT WE AVOID WREAKING FURTHER HAVOC ON CALIFORNIANS LIVES. TODAY AS OUR BUDGET CHAIR POINTED OUT WE MEET OUR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO PASS A BALANCED RESPONSIBLE BUDGET BY JUNE FIFTEENTH. JUST AS THE GOVERNOR HAS MET HIS CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY OBLIGATION TO PRESENT A BUDGET. TO US THE LEGISLATURE. I JUST AS WE DIDN'T AGREE WITH EVERY DETAIL OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HE HAS NOT YET AGREED TO EVERY DETAIL OF THE BUDGET THE LEGISLATURE IS PASSING TODAY. TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT COMES NEXT WE CONTINUE TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNOR AND HIS STAFF AND NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING. FATHER WILL BE CHANGES TO REFLECT THE FINAL AGREEMENT. WE WILL NOT DEVIATE FROM THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE HAVE OUTLINED IN THIS BUDGET. NOW THAT WE HAVE BOTH MET OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS IT'S TIME FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO COME TOGETHER AND MEET OUR MORAL OBLIGATION AND REACH A FINAL BUDGET AGREEMENT. IN TIME FOR THE START OF THE FISCAL NEW YEAR. FORTUNATELY I DO BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR SHARES THESE VALUES AND THAT WE WILL ALL BE CONTINUING THE HARD WORK TO FIND AN AGREEMENT THANK YOU. MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS THE SENATOR NIELSEN. PRESIDENT LAYS DOWN WITH THE SENATE YOU. I WANT A COP ALL MEMBERS OF THIS HONORABLE BODY. AS WE'VE LISTENED TO OUR DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATE HERE THUS FAR. IT TYPIFIES THE WAY THE SENATE WORKS. RESPECTFUL WITH DIGNITY THOROUGHNESS. AND YES INDEED WITH PASSION ON THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE IT. AS TO THE BUDGET I'M THANK YOU GLAD THAT THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR. I WONDER WHAT IT BE THAT HE MIGHT BE TELL THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET. THE OTHER WILL BE FOLLOWING TRAILER BILL SAID IMPLEMENTED AND- THAT KIND OF DRAGS OUT. THE BUDGET AS AND WHEN WILL THERE BE A BUDGET. WE LEAVE HERE TODAY NOT AND GLEEFUL THAT WE COMPLETED OUR TASK. WITH ONLY MADE. A COUPLE OF STEPS. I ARGUE THAT THEY ARE STEPS IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND IN FACT THE BUDGET PROCESS. AND YOU'LL EXCUSE ME BUT I'VE TAKEN THE CALL IT NOT A PROCESS BUT A SCRUM. BUT IT PLAY RUGBY THEY DID PLAY FOOTBALL. I PLAY THE LINE AND WHEN YOU START A PLATE IT'S ALL OF THIS SHUFFLING AND TING AND- NOT REALLY NECESSARILY ALWAYS GETTING ANYWHERE A STRONG. THAT MORE TO ME DESCRIBES WHAT ARE BUDGET HAS DEVOLVED INTO WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET. REPUBLICANS WERE NOT INVOLVED. WHEN WE DO HAVE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AT LEAST THERE'S AT OPPORTUNE FOR. TO EXPRESS OPINIONS TO EXERCISE THE DO SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT THAT IS THE MISSION OF THE SENATE. AND WHOEVER PREVAILS PREVAILS. BUT IF YOU REMEMBER THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ON THESE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ITSELF. WE NEVER LOCKSTEP BOAT. RARELY EVER. AND THAT'S A GOOD PART OF THE PROCESS. NOW OVER THE YEARS THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IS IN ONE PLACE WHERE THERE COULD BE SOME BART BY PARTISAN DISCUSSION NEGOTIATION. EVEN SOME INPUT WITH THE GOVERNOR. HERE IN GERMAN. THAT HAS BEEN UTTERLY LACKING. EACH OF US REPRESENT ONE MILLION PEOPLE. AND I WOULD ARGUE. BY VIRTUE OF CUTTING OUT. THE REPUBLICANS FROM DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS. THE CARD IT CUTTING OUT A MILLION PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT. FROM THEIR VOICES BEING HEARD JEWELERS. THEY SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT THAT THEY ARE BEING DENIED THE POSITION OF OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THINGS. THE OTHER ALL WISH REFORMS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE I REFERRED TO THE LACK OF REFORMS IN THE EDUCATIONAL PORTION OF THE BUDGET WE JUST VOTED FOR. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL IF THERE HAD BEEN SOME. AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME IN THIS BUDGET AT LEAST IS WHAT I KNOW AT THIS MOMENT. OUR REFORMS FORMALLY DONE THAT ARE BEEN ROLLED BACK TO SOME DEGREE. AND THERE ARE SOME PROVISIONS IN HERE THAT ARE ARGUABLY GOOD REFORMS FOR THE FUTURE. THAT COULD WORK WARRANT AND ENJOY BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. NOT THE TAX THE BUSINESS THAT IS NOT A REFORM. AND SOME SEEM TO THINK THAT ANY TIME THAT YOU IF TAXES TO NEW MANTRA HERE. IF YOU GIVE ANY MONEY BACK. TO THE CITIZENS OR LEAVE BUSINESS OR CITIZENS OF A TAX BURDEN. THAT THAT IS A GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS. WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE ILLEGAL WE SHOULD NOT MAKE A GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS BUT I THINK THAT IS AN ABSURDITY. WHERE THE MAD HATTER'S TEA PARTY. THAT'S TAXPAYERS MONEY AS I SEE IT. AND WE NEED TO RESPECT AND THEY DESERVE TO HAVE A VOICE. IN THIS INSTITUTION. THERE'S AN AREA OF GREAT MAGNITUDE THE ALSO HAS ALONG THE WAY BEEN CONSISTENTLY NEGLECT. THAT IS THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OF HIGH TECH UPGRADES THAT THE STATE HAS EMBARKED UPON OVER THIS MANY YEARS. MANY YEARS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS GREAT TENNESSEE IS A PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY FROM THIS WONDERFUL STATE. TECHNOLOGICAL CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. HARDLY. ANY OF THE WORK. HARDLY ANY BROUGH GOTTEN DONE ON TIME. HARDLY ANY OF THEM HAVE EVER COME IN ON BUDGET. NO THE PROCESS GOES ALONG. THE CHEESE THE LIMITS OF TIME. AND THEN THERE'S A TECH COMPANY THIS IS ALL ALLOW THERE'S IS NEW BOB DYLAN BANGLA INDEED THAT'S THE BEST IN THE WORLD SO WE NEED TO AMEND. THIS CONTRACT THERE'S BEEN A FEW MORE BILLION BUT NO PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. AND THEN THEY FAIL. NOW SEVERAL YEARS AGO IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THERE WOULD BE A SOLUTION. AG DEPARTMENT. WAS CREATED. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ABLE PEOPLE HEADING THAT DEPARTMENT EVEN NOW ARE THERE. HOWEVER THE PRODUCT. HAS BEEN UTTERLY LACKING AND GETTING ANYTHING DONE AND THEY ALL THE IMPORTANT THING THAT'S BEEN DONE WITH THESE THIS AGENCY IS IT'S BEEN RENAMED I THINK NOW THREE TIMES. THREE TIMES AT LEAST IN MY COUNTY. IS BEEN RENAMED. DID THAT CHANGE ANYTHING. I DON'T THINK TO THIS DAY IT HAS IF THERE WAS A REFORM THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THIS BILL. THAT'S ONE WE SHOULD GET OUR HANDS ON AND FIGURE OUT IN THIS MAGNIFICENT STATE. HOW TO GET HI TECH APPLICATION THE STATE AGENCIES RIGHT. AND WE'VE BEEN NOTHING THAT HAVE BEEN A DISMAL FAILURE. HERE TO FOR. ONE OTHER THAT IT WAS OF SOME HISTORIC INTEREST WITH A TO PORTABLE TODAY AS WELL. WE DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING WITHIN THE AGENCY. THE FORMER GOVERNOR MADE A BIG DEAL OF BLOWING UP THE BOXES MEETING THE BUREAUCRACY THESE FAST AGENCIES THAT CONTROL THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT CONTROLS OUR LIFE. SUCH A HIGH DEGREE. AND THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN SUCH A THOMAS. AUTHORITY THE BIG AGENCIES. WELL. NOT MANY OF THOSE BOXES GOT BLOWN UP. IN FACT MY RECALL ONLY ONE DID. WAS THE BIGGEST ONE. DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS MANY YEARS AGO. IRONICALLY AND I ARGUED AT THE TIME THAT AGENCY. WAS BOTTOM LIGHT. WORKERS TO THE TOP FLIGHT AND BOTTOM HEAVY. MEETING THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES. WERE FAR TOO. FEW IN THOSE OFFICES TO RUN AT THAT TIME A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR AGENCY NOW I THINK IT'S SOMETHING A YOU LATER MORE. SO THE BLOW UP OF THE BOXES TOOK FOUR WAS. STOP LIGHT AND BOTTOM HEAVY. AND MADE IT PROPERLY END BOTTOM HEAVY. THAT'S KIND REMAIN THAT WAY OVER THE YEARS. MAYBE STILL NOW AND WE'RE STILL STRIVING. TO MAKE IT BETTER. BUT AS I ASK. FOR THIS BILL A NO VOTE TODAY. I SAY WE DARE NOT. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT. LITTLE WHAT WILL BE UP TO A NINE BILLION DOLLAR TAX INCREASE OUT THERE. IN THE BUDGET. SO INCREASED AND EVEN A TOUGH TIME. BETTER NOT. SAY THAT WE'VE DECLARE VICTORY HERE TODAY. BECAUSE WE PASSED THE BUDGET ON TIME. AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN SOMETHING LIKE WE WERE AND- JUST A FEW YEARS AGO IN THE NINETIES. WE SAT DOWN AT OUR DESKS AND HAD SEVEN HUNDRED PAGES OF THE BUDGET. COME UP ON THE COMPUTER BEFORE. AND THEN VOTED ON THAT LEDGE. WITH NO CHANCE TO ABSORB IT REVIEW IT TO TAKE IT. OR EVEN OFFER ANY CONSTRUCTIVE CHANGES. THAT ISN'T LATEST GENERAL OF THE SENATE A BUDGET PROCESS THAT'S AT BEST A SCRUM. AND I ARGUED DISSERVICE TO THE CITIZEN WE REPRESENT. AND THEREFORE I URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF ALL THE SENATORS HERE AND I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE- THOUGHTFUL DELIBERATIONOF THE BUDGET CHAIR WOMAN THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS I KNOW THIS IS NOT AN EASY PROCESS I KNOW THAT EVERYONE IN HERE'S HEARD. FROM THEIR CONSTITUENTS WERE VERY UPSET ABOUT THE CUTS THAT ARE BEING MADE FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT AREAS WE HAVE ALL HEARD IT SAID THIS IS NOT EASY ON ANYONE. BUT I HAVE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE ADDING. NINE HUNDRED POSITIONS. TO OUR STATE GOVERNMENT DURING A TIME WHEN WE ARE FACING A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR. DEFICIT AND WE'RE RELYING HEAVILY ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP US PAY THOSE BILLS. ONE HUNDRED AND THREE POSITIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS FOR THE ENFORCEMENT AND ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD RELATED TO AB FIVE. SAID THAT IS ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO GO OUT IN FORCE AB FIVE WHICH IS ALREADY HURT A THRIVING ECONOMY NOW EVEN MORE SO WITH THE EFFECTS OF KEVIN NINETEEN. SIXTY THREE POSITIONS FOR DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS FOR ENHANCED LABOR ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER ADMINISTRATION- AGAIN GOING OUT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING TRYING TO PAY THEIR TAXES THAT THE STATE HAS THE REVENUE. IN ORDER TO PAY FOR ALL THOSE THINGS WE HEARD ABOUT IN THE LAST TRAILER BILL. EIGHTY FIVE NEW POSITIONS TO SHIFT FROM CONTRACTORS TO STATE EMPLOYEES AT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS IT STATES THAT THAT THIS IS AN ESTIMATED EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLAR SAVINGS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF MATH IS TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S AN EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLAR SAVINGS WHEN YOU'RE BRINGING ON TOO MANY THE STATE EMPLOYEES AND THE COST OF CREDIT ITSELF. IS HIGHER- THE NEED TO MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS THAT IS SUGGESTED WITHIN THIS BUDGET. THIRTY EIGHT NEW. FOR THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAMMING A COST OF SIX POINT FOUR MILLION FOR THE DMB. A PROGRAM THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM WHICH WAS GOOD INTENTIONED. BUT DOESN'T WORK HAS A NUMBER OF FEELINGS THAT WE HAVE YET TO ADDRESS. AND HAVE YET TO COMMIT TO FIXING SO WHY WOULD WE THEN INVEST MORE MONEY INTO A PROGRAM. THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING AND I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE PUTTING MONEY INTO THE BUDGET. FOR THE DMB WHICH I THOUGHT. AS OF EARLIER TODAY WAS GOING TO BE TO UPDATE THE I. T. OUR SYSTEM IN THE DMB SAID THAT THIS MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM COULD WORK. THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS THAT IN FACT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THE MONEY IS NOT GOING TO INVEST IN THE I. T. SYSTEM AN UPGRADE. IT'S JUST GOING TOWARDS PERSONNEL. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT IMPROVES THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE PUT INTO PLACE. SO AGAIN AT A TIME WHERE WE ARE FACING SUCH A HUGE DEFICIT IN MAKING SUCH PAINFUL CUTS. ACROSS THE BOARD THAT HURTS YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR- POLITICAL PREFERENCES WHAT PARTY YOU BELONG TO IT'S HURTING EVERYONE. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IN GOOD CONSCIENCE WE CAN VOTE FOR THESE TYPES OF INCREASES IN FUNDING WHEN WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY FOR THOSE REASONS I WOULD URGE YOU KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MELINDA'S. SO BRAD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I PERSONALLY WANT TO THANK OUR BUDGET CHEERING THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK AND GETTING IS TO THIS DAY I KNOW WAS A TRUNCATED PROCESS BUT LONG HOURS NONE THE LESS. AND EXCITED ABOUT A BUDGET THAT I DO SUPPORT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS I WANT TO FIRST AGAIN US STATE AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR FOR POLLS CUTS THE MARTIN LUTHER HOSPITAL DID NOT MAKE IT INTO THIS BUDGET AND I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK OUR BUDGET CHEER WHO DESERVES PARTICULAR HERE- AND MAKING SURE WE SAFEGUARD THIS VITAL RESOURCE IN THIS COMMUNITY. THIS HOSPITAL IS ONE OF ONLY A FEW HOSPITALS THAT SERVE THE WALKS HARBOR GATEWAY- COMMUNITIES PRIMARILY MINORITIES IT'S A HOSPITAL THAT ROLLS OUT OF THE- ALL RIGHT. SO NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. IT'S A CRITICAL OF FISSILE IN OUR AND IT SERVES. MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVE WITHIN THESE HOSPITAL DESERT'S ANY REDUCTION IN SERVICES AT MARTIN LUTHER KING HOSPITAL WOULD WORSEN THEIR HEALTH. DISPARITIES FOR MINORITIES IN LOW INCOME. PATIENTS IN THAT AREA THESE COULD SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN CONSIDER VERTICALLY DURING A PANDEMIC THAT HAS HIT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE HARDEST I'M GLAD THE LEGISLATURE IS AN OUR BUDGETEERS THIS COMMUNITY. THAT IS VITALLY NEEDED. MY SECOND ISSUE OF A DEALING WITH. THE REAL OF DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND I'M GLAD THAT THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE MANY MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLES AND IN BOTH HOUSES OF EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN. AND HAVING OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS- TO VARIOUS HEARINGS WITHOUT A DOUBT. THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE WANT TO PROTECT CONSUMERS IN YOUR FINANCES BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY. THAT INCLUDES IMPROVING HOW WE REORGANIZED. AT SERVERS. THE DIVERS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS YET AGAIN WE HAVE SEEN THIS AND DURING THIS CRISIS ILLUSTRATED HOW OFTEN MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES ARE OVERLOOKED. BY PUBLIC PROGRAMS AS WE WELL KNOW. VERY FEW IF ANY MINORITY BUSINESSES RECEIVED ANY OF THE CASHIERS ARE PPP DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN WHAT LITTLE HAPPEN WAS DURING SUBSEQUENT WOUND TO DO THE LEGISLATIVE. BLACK CAUCUS THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS AND FINALLY I APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PRO TEM AS WELL AS OUR- MAJORITY LEADER MY COLLEAGUES ON THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY WORKING GROUP AND I WAS HONORED TO SERVE AS- COACH HERE THERE WILL BE SOME VITAL PROPOSALS COMING FORWARD SOON. IN AREAS OF DEALING WITH. CAN IT LANDLORD PROTECTION AS WELL AS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HELP STIMULATE- BUSINESSES AND I AND OUR ECONOMY. THESE PROPOSALS COULD HELP ADDRESS SERIOUS EQUITY ISSUES AND HOUSING. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND SMALL BUSINESS FUNDING AMONG OTHER AREAS. THERE WILL ALSO BE. THEY'RE ALSO COMPANY WILL ALSO COMPLEMENT I SHOULD SAY THE BUDGET BY BEING MINDFUL. TO ARE LIMITED BUDGET RESOURCES. THERE ARE EXACTLY THESE ARE EXACTLY THE KIND OF FORT MEANING FAST MOVING PROPOSALS THAT WE NEED TO GET THROUGH. THIS CRISIS I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE MOVE FOR WE'RE FACING MULTIPLE CHALLENGES AS A STATE AND AS A NATION BUT THIS BUDGET IS NOT ONE OF THEM I LOOK FOR TO AND I VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TOO WOULD LIKE TO THINK- THE BUDGET CHAIR FOR THE- WORK THAT SHE PUT INTO THIS BUDGET BILL AND SPECIFICALLY AS UNITED STATES MILITARY VETERAN ACTUALLY FIRST FEMALE VETERAN IT'S EVER SERVED ON THIS FLOOR. MODERN TO BE JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE AND THAT JUST BECAME AND A SENATOR ON THIS FLOOR BUT IS A FEMALE THAT TREND. I AM- VERY GRACIOUS AND VERY THANKFUL THAT THE BUDGET CHAIR DID NOT ALLOW FOR THE VETERANS HOME IN BARSTOW TO DISPLACE ALMOST TWO HUNDRED VETERANS THAT HAVE- DEFENDED THIS NATION AND THEN TO BE KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOMES- BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CRISIS OR THE BUDGET. THAT THE GOVERNOR SUBMIT A STATE LEGISLATURE I THINK THE BUDGETARY. FOR MAKING SURE THAT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT AND SO TO THE VETERANS OF THE PART OF THAT TO SOME THAT. THIS I DO. NOT TO THE BILL A VERY ELSE THAT IS IN THE BILL. MANY LOOK AT. WHAT IN ON AND PIECE ALLEGE. IS A BY. IT'S NOW TRANSPARENT LIKE MIKE. FROM TO HIM HAS JUST ADDRESS THAT IT WAS DONE IN A BACKROOM DEAL. WERE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS DID NOT HAVE THE REPRESENTATION- TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. REGARDING THIS BUDGET DEAL SO I IF I OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUE. I ALSO OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE THE TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS IN THERE FOR AB FIVE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS IN THERE FOR AB FIVE THERE'S TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. TO STOP REPAIR PERSONS LAND SURVEYORS CAMPAIGN WORKERS CATERS INTERPRETERS MUSICIANS. FRANCHISEES IN FRANCHISE ORDERS. THAT TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THERE TO STOP THEM FROM PROVIDING FOR THEIR FAMILIES. STOP THEM FOR BEING AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR IN OWNING THEIR OWN BUSINESS. IT STOPS THEM FROM THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE TO PROVIDE. FOR THEIR RENT THEIR HOUSING AND JUST LIKE I SAID PROVIDING FOR FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS COVER NINETEEN SITUATION THE GOVERNOR PUT OUT AN ALL OUT CALL HE WAS CALLED THE- CALIFORNIA HEALTH CORPS. CALLING ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS BACK TO THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A RELIABLE FRONT LINE HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE CODE NINETEEN SITUATION. SO WITH THIS TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S PUT IN THIS BUDGET FOR AB FIVE AFTER THE GOVERNOR PUT OUT THAT CALL FOR ALL OF THESE HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO COME FORWARD. ALL THAT ARE AFFECTED BY EIGHTY FIVE IN THIS MONEY THAT'S GOING TO STOP NURSE PRACTITIONERS. PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANTS ARE TOM A TRYST. PHYSICAL THERAPIST RESPIRATORY THERAPIST RATE A RADIATION THERAPIST. ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE CALLED UPON TO STEP FORWARD AND COME AND HELP RESCUE US WITH THIS CODE NINETEEN SITUATION. THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION WILL FIND POSITIONS TO STOP THEM FROM BEING EMPLOYED. WHEN I LOOK AT THE TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S OUT THERE TO STOP INDIVIDUALS FROM THE GIG ECONOMY DOOR DASH THE SINGLE MOMS THE RETIREES THAT USE THIS AS ADDITIONAL INCOME TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR RETIREMENT OR TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR- THEIR HOUSING COST WHEN THEY GO TO WIN THEIR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL AND THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK. THIS BILL FUNDS TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN POSITIONS TO NOT ALLOW THESE INDIVIDUALS TO WORK. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IT'S GOING TO BE ALLOCATED I'M SORRY TWO POINT NINE BILLION WITH A B. NOT AGAIN MY APOLOGIES. TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN IN RESOURCES THAT ARE GOING TO TAX REVENUE FROM PEOPLE THAT PAY TAXES IN THE STATE. PRIVATE BUSINESSES TO FIND POSITIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL WHICH IS A COMPLETE DISASTER DESTROYING OUR CENTRAL VALLEY. BUDGET AND NOW WE'RE ADDING ANOTHER TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN POSITIONS FOR THAT THAT RAIL FAIL. WE HAVE FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS STATE BUDGET DEFICIT WE'VE GOT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET FOR A STATE PARK AND I KNOW ALL OF US UP HERE YOU GUYSTHINK THAT JUST BUDGET THAT'S WHERE EVEN ADDRESSING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. WHERE IS A STATE PARK OUT RECENTLY AND CAN BE PURCHASED FROM FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO A LONG WAYS TO SOMEBODY WHO. DOES NOT HAV A JOB AND IS ONE OF THOSE FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF WORK THAT ARE WATCHING THIS HEARING AND KNOWING THAT. THE THINGS THAT WERE ADDRESSING IN THIS BUDGET DON'T EVEN ADDRESSED THE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE WITH FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION UNEMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE. YEAH SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR BEST SIERRA. FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SUE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WE'VE SATISFIED IN THIS BUDGET SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO PAY FOR LAWSUIT SO THAT THIS. DATA CALIFORNIA CAN SUE THE PRESS THE STRIP ADMINISTRATION THE PRESENT UNITED STATES. BUT YET WERE ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE. BAD HE KNEW HIM. WERE BEGGING HIM FOR FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN BAILOUT SO THAT THIS BODY CAN MEET THE NEEDS THAT IT HAS. DETECTED SPENDING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE'RE EITHER LIKE A GOVERNOR SAYS A NATION STATE. AND WE'RE APPLYING FOR FOREIGN AID FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR WE ARE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK HAND IN HAND WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS. AND SET ASIDE SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SEE THE PRESIDENT. IT'S JUST CRAZY. ALL THE INFORMATION THAT LEADS UP TO THIS BUDGET. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS IN THERE IN THIS BUDGET THAT ARE NOT TRANSPARENT. THAT MAKE NO SENSE THE DON'T PRIDE IN PROVIDING QUALITY AND THAT HINDER IN HURT OUR PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR SO THAT WE CAN'T PROVIDE JOBS. TO RAISE THE OR TO IT TO PAY TAXES AND PAY EMPLOYEES. AND HAVE THEM PAY INTO THE STATE WHICH PAYS FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE SPEND HERE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GROPE SENATOR CABALLERO. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. THURSDAY PRESIDENT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY- I WANT TO START OFF BY THINKING OUR BUDGET CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR CREATING THE FRAMEWORK IN THE GUIDE TO HELP OUR THINKING IN THIS I THINK THE WORK THAT% WAS DONE WAS REALLY INCREDIBLE AND FRANKLY WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE SAME LANGUAGE IN THE SAME MATURE AS A BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING I AM. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO PASS THIS BILL. BUT THERE IS I RISE TODAY TO VOICE MY CONCERNS ABOUT PLACE HOLDER LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT APPROPRIATES FUNDS TO THE STATE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO CONDUCT RULE MAKING. TO CONSIDER CHANGES TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM SO WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IT SOME OTHER TIME. BUT BECAUSE IT HAD THERE'S PLACEHOLDER LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL. I WANTED TO OPEN IT ABOUT IT. IT CREATES A MANDATE TO CONDUCT A RULE MAKING THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD SAYS IT DOES NOT NEED. THREE YEARS AGO AB THREE NINETY EIGHT WHICH FORMALLY ENACTED THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS STATUTORILY. WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND SIGNIFICANT NEGOTIATIONS AND COMPROMISES BY EVERYONE- YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT IT WAS A DIFFICULT NEGOTIATION. AND IN pTHE END. WE PASSED A BILL THAT REQUIRED THE A. R. B. USING ITS BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE TO UNDERTAKE A RULE MAKING AND AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR A PUBLIC WORKSHOPS AND HEARINGS. THEIR FINAL REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED. AND ALTHOUGH THE IMMEDIATE PROGRAM CHANGES TOOK EFFECT IN APRIL OF TWENTY NINETEEN. THAT MAJOR CHANGES WON'T GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL NEXT YEAR. AND SO THE PROPONENTS OF THIS NEW RULE MAKING BY THE ERROR BE THEY RELY ON A REPORT THAT WAS PREPARED BY THE LA- AND THE LA- ISSUED THE REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH WAS PRIOR TO THE A. R. B. STARTING. THEIR RULE MAKING PROCESS. AND IN THAT REPORT THE LA- ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE REVENUES WOULD FLUCTUATE BASED ON EMISSIONS. PER YEAR THERE ARE BE CONSIDERED THE ISSUE AS PART OF THEIR TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN RULE MAKING AND AS UPDATING DATED THERE SCOPING PLAN SINCE THEN SO THEY'VE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION ABOUT THE LA CONCERNS EQUALLY OF CONCERN IS THAT. THE LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT AND THAT LANGUAGE COULD CHANGE THE LANGUAGE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT. WOULD REQUIRE. THAT NEW RULE MAKING OCCUR WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT THAT ACT ARE THE LEGISLATURE'S. PROCEDURES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IN ENSURE A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS SO TO SET UP A RULE MAKING IT SAY BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO. TO DO THE DEAL WITH THE APA ON THIS IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS AND SO WHAT IT WOULD DO IS UNDER MY IT WOULD OPEN THE WHOLE PROCESS TO LEGAL CHALLENGE AND UNDERMINE THE MARKET CONFIDENCE. HOLDING A PUBLIC MEANING IS NOT MEANING IN A MEANINGFUL EQUIVALENT TO A PUBLIC NOTICE. AND PUBLICATION REQUIREMENTS IN THE PUBLIC REGISTER SO THIS PROPOSAL SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANTLY STEPS ALL OVER AND VIOLATE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE MADE A SCANT THREE YEARS AGO. AND I WANT TO REPEAT. I SUPPORT. SB SEVENTY FOUR. AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE THE ANTICIPATED FUNDING THAT'S NOT NEEDED BY A RB- AND THAT REQUIRES UNNECESSARY RULE MAKING THAT GIVES THEM MORE POWER TO MAKE COME OUR APPROVAL SO- I AND I DO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY SEE THAT. BILL DISAPPEAR. THANK HE SAID CABALLERO CENTER MORAL. THANK YOU MADAM. COLLEAGUES AT THE RECESSION GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN WORRIED ABOUT FEARED WHAT TIME IS HERE. AND IT CAME ON LIKE A HEART ATTACK JUST IN A MATTER OF A FEW MONTHS. REGRETFULLY RECESSIONS HAVE A HISTORY OF STAYING FOR A FEW YEARS AND THIS IS MY MAJOR CONCERN ABOUT THE BUDGET. FOR THIS YEAR AND MOVING. AS WE DISCUSS SB EIGHT OH EIGHT AND SB SEVENTY FOUR. CONSEQUENTLY RELYING ON OUR ON OUR RAINY DAY FUND PROBABLY WON'T MAKE IT THE DISTANCE. HOPING ON FEDERAL FUNDS IT'S A UNIQUE STRATEGY FOR A STATE NOT CONSIDERED PHYSICALLY WELL MANAGED BY MOST OF THE OTHER STATES. AFTER ALL WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT THAT DEFICITS IN THE NATION WE ARE RACING NEW JERSEY AND ILLINOIS TO THE BOTTOM. AND IN HELLA BURSTING IS THAT. CALIFORNIA'S PER CAPITA NUMBERS PUT IT IN THE BOTTOM TEN STATES. IN OUR STATE CONTROLLER IS THE ONLY ONE OUT OF FIFTY STATES IN THIS NATION THAT HASN'T PRODUCED AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE REELING. I USED TO BE CHAIRMAN OF A CREDIT COUNSELING NONPROFIT AND BOY YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE PEOPLE ARE JUST A TEETERING ONE PAYCHECK AWAY IT CENTERED CENTER THIS IS A TOUGH TIME. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS COVERT NINETEEN RECESSION WILL BE A MULTI YEAR EVENT. THIS BUDGET AND THIS BODY ARE IGNORING THREE CRITICAL STRATEGIES. THE FIRST IS DOWNSIZING REDUCING STAFFING IS WHAT OUR COUNTERPARTS AT THE COUNTIES CITIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE DOING AS WE SPEAK. WE CAN'T KEEP LYING AT OR NEAR THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR LEVEL. AND MAINTAINING CURRENT SPENDING LEVELS SHOULD BE REEVALUATED. THE LONGER SACRAMENTO WAITS TO MAKE REAL CUTS VERSUS CAPRICIOUS TRIGGER CUTS. THE GREATER THE PAIN WILL BE IN THE NEXT TWO FISCAL YEARS. YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ONE SIMPLE RECOMMENDATION DROP HIGH SPEED RAIL LET'S GET REAL. THAT WOULD REALLY MESSAGE TO THE CONSTITUENTS THAT SACRAMENTO SERIOUS ABOUT IT. BALANCING ITS BUDGETS. TO TWO YEARS YOU'LL BE NOTIFIED BY CALPERS AND CAL STIRS AT THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ANNUAL REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS WILL RISE AND PROBABLY SIGNIFICANTLY. SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD BARELY MAKE THEIR PAYMENTS THE LAST FEW YEARS EVEN WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING INCREASES. BECAUSE OF THEIR REQUIREMENT TO ADD MORE TO THEIR PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS. WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO OCCUR CALLING SAYS IS AND THE SOONER THE BETTER IS A MASSIVE PENSION REFORM. THE GOVERNOR WOULD BE WISE TO ESTABLISH A COMMITTEE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE STATE OF WISCONSIN AMPLE STATE OF WISCONSIN IMPLEMENTED A SHARED RISK PLAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. AND IT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN FULLY FUNDED FOR MANY YEARS NOW. AND IT IT'S CONCEPT THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT BUT STUBBORNLY HANGING ON TO THE CURRENT PLANS MEANS NO PAY RAISES OR COST OF LIVING INCREASES. THE STATE EMPLOYEES FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEY CAN HAVE BOTH A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AND PAY RAISES THE MATH JUST WILL NOT WORK. IT'S UP TO THEM TALK TO US WITH YOUNGER EMPLOYEES PREFER. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AND PAY FOR CHILD CARE OR THEY WANT TO HAVE MORE WITHHELD FROM THEIR PAYCHECKS SO THEY CAN FIND A PENSION PLAN WHICH EVENTUALLY MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE. THREE ANOTHER SYSTEMIC BUDGET BUSTER THAT CAN AND SHOULD E TAMED. IS RETIREE MEDICAL. BUT UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF SOME NINETY BILLION DOLLARS IS A HUNGRY ANIMAL TO FEED IN. ORANGE COUNTY ADDRESS THEIR UNFUNDED ACTUAL REAL CRUDE LIABILITY IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE BARGAINING UNITS AND WE REDUCED OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY 71% IF WE COULD DO THAT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THROUGH THIS BODY WE COULD REMOVE SIXTY BILLION FROM OUR BALANCE SHEET WE COULD REMOVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ANUAL REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS AND YOU MAY FIND THE RESOURCES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. FROM DC. CALLING FOR ALL TERM LIMITED. BUT WE STILL NEED TO TAKE A LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE. AND A CRISIS PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIESIT'S JUST A MATTER OF LEADERSHIP. THE DAYS OF TAX INCREASES ARE OVER THE DAYS OF PUTTING BONDS ON THE BALLOT SHOULD ALSO BE OVER THE DAYS OF GOLD PLATED PENSIONS MUST COME TO AN END AND BETTER RETIREMENT STRATEGIES MUST BE PURSUED MOVE FORWARD. THE RETIREE MEDICAL PLANS THAT DON'T EVEN INTEGRATE WITH MEDICARE ARE INEXCUSABLE. COLLEAGUES I'VE BEEN THROUGH A MUNICIPAL BANKRUPTCY CHAPTER NINE I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE GREAT RECESSION CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF ORANGE COUNTY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. DIFFICULT TIMES BUT THE SOONER YOU MOVE THE BETTER GOES AND- THIS THE SELF INDUCED ECONOMIC PANIC OR- WHAT WE'RE IN DURING NOW HAS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR THE LONG TERM GIVING IT A COUPLE OF ASPIRINS AND HOPING SACRAMENTO AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE FINE IN THE MORNING. WILL NOT CUT IT. CONSEQUENTLY I WILL BE OPPOSED TO THIS BUDGET THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCKS SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS- MENOPAUSE I'M GONNA TRY TO. RESTRAIN MY EMOTION. AND ANGER AS I SHARE MY COMMENTS THIS MORE THIS AFTERNOON. BUT I WANT TO SHARE THAT THE THAT THIS BUDGET IS PERSONALLY OFFENSIVE. TO ME. AND WHILE IT OPPRESSES TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT. IT ALSO PRESSES. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HEAR OFTEN THAT THE BUDGET REVEALS OUR VALUES. AND THIS BUDGET DRAWS A BRIGHT LINE. BETWEEN THE VALUES OF THE MINORITY PARTY AND THE VALUES OF THE MAJORITY PARTY BUT NOT ONLY THAT BUT A BRIGHT LINE BETWEEN THE VALUES OF THE MAJORITY PARTY. AND THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIANS AS A WHOLE. WELL MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE MAJORITY OF THE MINORITY PARTY. HAVE OWNED BUSINESSES. BEN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. HIRED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. AND RELIED ON THEM. FOR TO GET WORK DONE. A HAND FULL IN THE MAJORITY PARTY THAT HAD THAT SAME EXPERIENCE. WELL MANY CALIFORNIANS WAKE UP EVERY MONDAY MORNING TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE PAYROLL BY FRIDAY. AND PAY THE WITHHOLDING TAXES FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES BY FRIDAY. OR BUILD THEIR BUSINESS OR EXPAND THEIR BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. VIEW THE MAJORITY PARTY OF HAD THAT EXPERIENCE OR RESPONSIBILITY. WHILE MANY IN THE MINORITY PARTY IN CALIFORNIA OF HAVE THE STRESS. OF HIRING GOOD EMPLOYEES. AND REALLY SEEING OUR FIRING BAD EMPLOYEES. ZERO IN THE MAJORITY PARTY I'VE HAD THAT STRESS OR EXPERIENCE. WHY DOES THIS LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO PRESS HARD WORKING HONEST CALIFORNIANS I JUST WANT TO MAKE A LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. TO PAY FOR THE COLLEGE FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO PAY THEIR TAXES TO BUY A HOME TO BUILD A HOME. TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AS THE MINORITY LEADER HAS ALREADY MENTIONED TO ENFORCE. EIGHTY FIVE. ALL OF YOU ALL OF US HAVE HEARD OVERWHELMINGLY OVER AND OVER SINCE JANUARY. FROM CONSTITUENTS IN OUR DISTRICTS. THAT ARE STRUGGLING UNDER THE OPPRESSIVE NATURE OF AB FIVE. JUST ON THURSDAY I HAD ASSUME CALL WITH SEVERAL- TATTOO ARTISTS NOT JUST FOR MY DISTRICT WERE FROM ALL OVER SAN DIEGO COUNTY. NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY TATTOOS. NOBODY IN MY FAMILY HAS ANY TATTOOS. BUT BEING ATTACHED TO TALK ARTIST IS A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHY ARE WE PREVENTING THEM WHY ARE YOU PREVENTNG THEM FROM DOING THEIR WORK AND PROVIDING FOR THEIR FAMILY. NOW WHY IS HIS BUDGET PERSONALLY OFFENSIVE TO ME. AS FOR MOST OF MY LIFE I'VE BEEN AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. MY WIFE IS CURRENTLY AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. AND NOW. WE'RE GONNA SPEND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR RELEASE. THE STATE AGENCIES. ENFORCEMENT AGENTS WHOEVER THEY MIGHT BE. ARE A HARD WORKING SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. AND AS I LOOK AROUND ON THIS FLOOR TODAY I KNOW THAT I HAVE SEVERAL COLLEAGUES A HANDFUL OF COLLEAGUES. IN THE MAJORITY PARTY THAT OF OWN SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. AND MAYBE STILL HIGHER INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AS YOU VOTE I ON THIS BILL TODAY AS YOU VOTE I ON THIS BUDGET TODAY. AND YOU GIVE THE GOVERNOR MORE AUTHORITY TO SHUT DOWN THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES. I WANT YOU TO ASK YOURSELF. WHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO ALLOW THIS GOVERNMENT TO A PRESS SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN IS IT GONNA STOP. WHEN ARE WE GONNA ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING AND KEEP THEIR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN HOPE FOR. IS THAT THE VOTERS. IN CALIFORNIA WILL REMEMBER THIS DAY. WHEN THE DEMOCRATS WON'T REPRESENTS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THE REPUBLICANS WILL AND I HOPE THAT IS REMEMBERED ON NOVEMBER THIRD THIS YEAR. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON SB SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU SENATOR JONES SENATOR BILL. BETTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS. THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME THAT I ADDRESS THE LEGISLATURE ON THE BUDGET. PROBABLY AS A LEGISLATOR ALTHOUGH PROBABLY COME TO THE BUDGET HEARINGS AND TESTIFY- IN THE FUTURE. AND I WANT TO GO ON RECORD SAYING FOR THE TATTOO REMOVAL PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS OKAY. JUST SO WE TALK ABOUT TATTOOS HERE. THIS IS GOING TO BE A HARD VOTE. JUST LIKE WITH. IN THE PAST. I WANT TO REMAKE MAKE SOME REMARKS ON SOME ISSUES- THAT IMPACT- MY DISTRICT AND CALIFORNIANS THAT- ARE VULNERABLE TO THIS BUDGET. FIRST OF ALL. I WAS EXCITED THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TO DO SOME FOSTER CARE REFORM. AND I WASN'T ABLE TO DO THAT DO THIS- BUDGET BUT I WANTED TO STATE THIS. EVEN IN THE LIMITATIONS WE FACE. SIMILAR TO THE LIMITATIONS WHEN THE SIGNIFICANT FOSTER CARE LEGISLATION THAT WE ADOPTED IN TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN WE HAD A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT THAT AB TWELVE WAS ADOPTED IN SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER WE CAN DO A LOT. TO HELP FOSTER USE. AND PRESERVE THEY'RE HOPEFUL KNOWS THAT THEY HAVE IN OUR LIVES THERE'S THINGS YOU CAN DO EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE AND HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE WITH A. B. TWELVE. WHICH IS REALLY HELP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FOSTER USE OF IN OUR IN OUR STATE. AND I'M WORKING. HAND IN HAND WITH ABBOTT. TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR FOSTER USE IN TERMS OF THIS EMERGENCY DO YOU KNOW THAT THE PROTECTION OF FOR. RELIEVING FOSTER YOU FROM THE FOSTER YOU SYSTEM EXPIRES. ON JUNE THIRTIETH. THE UNLESS WE EXTEND THE CARE. FOR FOSTER USE THE THAT WILL EXPIRE. AND THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY BENEFITS FROM THE FOSTER USE SYSTEM. AND I THINK IN TERMS OF EMERGENCIES. THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE IN THE FUTURE SHOULD ADDRESS THAT. NOW. I WANT TO SAY THAT I'VE BEEN TO. IN MY FOURTEEN YEARS HERE. OUT TWENTY FIVE CALIFORNIA PENAL INSTITUTIONS AND WHEN I GO I ALWAYS ASKED THE WARDEN SO I SAID WELL CAN YOU TELL ME- IF YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF. HOW MANY FOSTER YOUTH YOU HAVE. IN THE- FORMER FROSTY IF YOU HAVE IN YOUR FACILITY. AND I HEAR SOMETIMES 25% IN THE WOMEN'S PRISON IS HIGHER. THESE ARE BILLS CHILDREN. THEY'VE HAD LIVES WITH HIS CHILDREN. THAT WE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR. YEAH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AMANDA PATRICIAN. SO IT SEEMS TO ME THERE ARE IN ORDER TO DO A GOOD JOB. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT. FROM A JUST A FISCAL STANDPOINT YOU REALLY YOU KNOW. THE COST OF TAKING CARE OF THE FOSTER USE IN A PRISON AT NINETY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AVERAGE. CALIFORNIA COST. SEEMS TO ME THAT. WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT EXTENDING THE SERVICES FOR FOSTER YOU BEYOND AGE TWENTY ONE. AND I HOPE THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME. GIVES GOOD ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. IT'S A FISCALLY AND MORALLY RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO. NOW SECOD LAKE I ADDRESS LAST WEEK IN THE BUDGET. COMMITTEE ANOTHER AREA THAT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT IS NOT BEEN LOOKED OUT FOR AWHILE IN A VERY COMPREHENSIVE WAY AND THAT'S THE ISSUE OF THE COUNTY STATE. YOU KNOW WE SPEND TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS. ON REALIGNMENT THE TWO REALIGNMENT THE NINETY ONE THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT PROGRAMS THAT'S UP TO. TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS. DO WE THINK THAT THE MAKE UP OF THE REALIGNMENT PERCENTAGE IS CORRECT. IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD REVIEW. I THINK IN LIGHT OF. ALL THE RECENT EVENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. ASKING US TO END RACISM TO LOOK AT SOCIAL JUSTICE TO LOOK AT POLICE EXPENDITURES TO LOOK AT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN A DIFFERENT WAY I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT THE FUNDING OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WE PROVIDE TO COUNTY SINCE TWO COUNTIES IN TERMS OF REALIGNMENT AND I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY. THAT WE- THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THOSE ISSUES. SO I THINK I WOULD URGE THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. TO CONTINUE TO EXAMINE THE ISSUE OF REALIGNMENT. DIRECT EXAMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE PRIORITIES ARE THE PROGRAMS WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT LOOKED AT IN LEAST TEN YEARS. DO WE WANT TO CHANGE THE PRIORITIES TO MORE. PROGRAMS ACTUALLY ARE BASED ON PERFORMANCE IN WORK AND THAT ACTUALLY PRODUCE RESULTS. THAT WE WANT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. AND BETTER CONDITIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND LASTLY I WANT TO ASK THAT THE CONTINUE DISCUSSION. REGARDING SANTA CLARA COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO IRAN NAPA. AND SAN MATTEO COUNTIES CONTINUE IN TERMS OF THE FORMULA FOR E. ROUGH I THINK THAT. HOPEFULLY A COMPROMISE SOLUTION CAN BE WORKED OUT. I THINK IF. THE COST OF THESE PROGRAMS ON COUNTIES IN TERMS OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS ONEROUS. AND IF IS INDEED THE DECISION. TWO IMPOSED. HE'S I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT SOME KIND OF ACCOMMODATION IN TERMS OF THE PAYMENT BE MADE. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT MOST THESE COUNTIES ARE SUFFERING. IN THOSE VERY PROGRAMS WE CARE ABOUT. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TERMS OF BUDGET DEFICITS. SO I THINK THOSE ARE ISSUES I WANTED REYES I THANK YOU AND I PLOD. THE WORK O ALL THE- PEOPLE WORKING ON THE BUDGET EXPRESS ESPECIALLY- OF. THE CHAIR WHO'S WORK VERY HARD AND ROUGH TIME. THIS YEAR. A LOT OF PROGRAMS. THE CHAIR WANTED. WE'RE ACTUALLY CUT. I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS. AND I APPRECIATE THE SENATE'S- INDULGENCE IN MY REMARKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BEING PRESENT THANK YOU SENATOR BILL BEFORE WE GET ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE KEPT YOUR MOUSE ON THE ENTIRE TIME A FEW FOLKS HAVE TAKEN THERE'S OFFICE WILL REMIND EVERYBODY BUT THAT THE SENATE DOES REQUIRE US ON THE FLOOR TO HAVE OUR HOUSE ON. NEXT IS SENATOR MY. THANK YOU MADAM. MEMBER THIS TOO IS THE LAST BUDGET I WILL VOTE ON TIME COMPLETING TWELVE YEARS IN THE LEGISLATURE I CAME INTO THE STATE ASSEMBLY WHEN WE FACED A FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. NOW THAT DEFICIT. IN THAT RECESSION WERE DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO THE MALFEASANCE AT THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY. A POINT OF FINANCIAL INDUSTRY THEY DIDN'T FACE IN NO PROSECUTION OR ANY JAIL TIME THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR HOMES. IN THEIR JOBS AND WE BUILT BACK. FROM THAT HUMAN COST DEFICIT. TO BUILDING A ROBUST ECONOMY. TO REDUCING OUR UNEMPLOYMENT pLEVELS TO RECORD LEVELS TO BUILDING OUR RESERVES TO RECORD LEVELS. THROUGH THE PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUDGET. IN THE LAST BUDGET CYCLES. TEN NOW FACING A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR. SHORTFALL. THE BECAUSE A PANDEMIC. THE PANDEMIC THEY JUST KILLED A HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICANS IN OVER FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS IN A PANDEMIC FRIENDS THAT THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT. WE DON'T KNOW THE TRAJECTORY WE CAN'T CONTROL. WHAT WE CAN DO IS TRY TO RESPOND RELYING ON SCIENCE AND BEST PRACTICES AND PART OF THAT IS MANAGING A BUDGET. IN A CRISIS THAT WAS NOT ARE MAKING. BUT WHICH WERE TASKED WITH NAVIGATING OUR WAY FORWARD. I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND MADAM BUDGET CHAIR THE BUDGET STAFF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND EVERYONE IS SERVED ON OUR BUDGET COMMITTEES BIPARTISAN BUDGET COMMITTEES. THAT HAVE DISCUSS THESE ISSUES AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THERE'S NO EASY WAY. TO BRIDGE A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL. BUT I CREDIT OUR LEGISLATURE IN THE LEADERS ARE PRO TEM IN OUR SPEAKER. FOR MANAGING A BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE US TODAY IN SB SEVENTY FOUR. THAT TAKES SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S ASSUMPTIONS. AND SOME OF HIS ARCHITECTURE. BUT WORKS TO MINIMIZE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS PACKS TO THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS FOR WHOM WE WANT TO PROTECT ACCESS TO BASIC HEALTH CARE BASIC HOUSING. BASIC IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES. WHEN WE TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE CLOSER OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ABSOLUTELY DEPEND UPON OUR VOICE TO LOOK OUT FOR THEM. AND LET ME COMMENT ON OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. I WAS ACKNOWLEDGED AS A CHAMPION OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES JUST LAST YEAR. BY STATE WIDE SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION I RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE CONSUMERS WHO SPEND THEIR MONEY ON THEIR SERVICES OR THEIR PRODUCTS. IN THIS BUDGET. IN OUR ABILITY TO MOBILIZE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS. IN SIXTEEN CERTAIN LIVING BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE ON CAL WORKS AND OTHERS YOU KNOW WHERE THOSE DOLLARS AND UP. THE END UP BEING SPENT AT THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO DEPEND ON THAT REVENUE TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES. AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW THE TRAJECTORY FRIENDS OF COVERT NINETEEN. BUSINESSES ARE TRYING TO RE OPEN. RACING TO QUICKLY. IN A MANNER THAT'S GONNA SET US FURTHER BACK FOR A LONGER TIME. THIS BUDGET ALSO. RECOGNIZES THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IN THIS STATE. AND I REPRESENT MANY IN ONE OF MY COUNTIES. THE MAJORITY LANGUAGE NATIVE LANGUAGE IS SPANISH. ONE OF MY COUNTIES HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS THEY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS HARVESTING OUR FOOD ND CONTINUING TO KEEP OUR FOOD SUPPLY LINES INTACT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT EVERY PAYCHECK THOSE WORKERS RECEIVE. THERE'S FEDERAL TAX WITHHELD THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY TAX WITHHELD THEIR STATE TAX WITHHELD AND THERE'S LOCAL TAXES WITHHELD. BUT IT'S TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION BECAUSE THOSE WORKERS PAYING INTO SUSTAIN OUR SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM FEDERALLY AND TO PAN TO OUR STATE TAX SYSTEM. TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION SO IT HURTS ME IN PAINS ME TO HEAR PEOPLE COMPLAIN. WHEN WE HAVE A BUDGET THAT RECOGNIZES THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS AND SEEKS TO GIVE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF WHAT'S PAID IN BACK IN THE FORM OF AN EXPANDED EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. THAT PROPOSES IN ANOTHER YEAR. TO PROVIDE MEDI CAL SUPPORT FOR SENIORS MOST OF WHOM FINISHED THEIR WORK OF HARD LABOR AT MINIMUM WAGE WITHOUT A PENSION. WITHOUT ELIGIBILITY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. AND WHO WE ARE TRYING IN THIS BUDGET. TO FOR CASTS TO SUPPORT. ACCESS TO BASIC MEDICAL CARE. NOT EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES AT THE END OF THE ROAD. PREVENTIVE CARE. HUMAN DIGNITY ACCESS TO BASIC HUMAN HEALTH SERVICES THAT'S WHAT THIS BUDGET PROPOSES TO DO IN THE FACE OF ONE OF THE WORST ECONOMIC HIPS TO OUR STATE OUR NATION AND OUR GLOBAL COMMUNITY. FRIENDS THIS BUDGET ALSO INCREASES OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT CAL FIRE WHEN OUR WILD FIRE CRISIS A REFLECTION OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS CONTINUES TO LOOM OVER US. WE HAVE A RECORD EARLY FIRE SEASON IN MY DISTRICT WE'VE HAD FIRES IN BIG SUR IN SANTA BARBARA IN. IN MY COLLEAGUES DISTRICT IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS AND WHAT THE VERY EARLY STAGE THIS BUDGET ANTICIPATES THAT CRISIS IN INCREASES SUPPORT FOR CAL FIRE AS IT HAS SUPPORTED. MORE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION IN OUR FIRE BUDGETS. THIS BUDGET ALSO SEEKS. TO PROTECT OUR CLEAN AIR COMMITMENTS ARE CLEAN WATER COMMITMENTS. IN OUR COMMITMENTS TO HANDING OFF A PLANET TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN IN FUTURE GENERATIONS WHO IF WE DON'T STEP TWO NOW. IT'LL BE TOO LATE. AND I PERSONALLY THINK THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS MAY BE AN EARLY WAKE UP CALL. AS WE SEE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS IN THE HEALTH SECTOR THE VIRUS WILL INFECT ANYONE. BUT THE IMPACTS ARE HITTING AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINO COMMUNITIES. AND WAGE WORKERS DEEMED ESSENTIAL MORE THAN OTHES WHO CAN WORK FROM HOME. WHO CONSUME THEIR LIVES IN KEEP GETTING PAYCHECKS. THIS BUDGET. LOOKS TO ADDRESSING THE IMMEDIATE HEALTH CRISIS. IN SIX TO PROTECT THE PRECAUTIONS WERE TRYING TO TAKE TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT TO PROTECT CLEAN AIR STANDARDS CLEAN WATER STANDARDS IN NOT. SEE THIS IS AN OPENING TO REDUCE HARD FOUGHT PROTECTIONS TO REDUCE FUNDAMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS WHICH ONCE AGAIN THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN COVERED. IN OUR ENVIRONMENT IS THAT ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM. SHOWS THAT THESE IMPACTS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT OF FACT LOW INCOME MINORITY COMMUNITIES TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES. SO FRIENDS I WILL CAST MY LAST BUDGET VOTE PROUDLY FOR THIS BUDGET. RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES AND THE SACRIFICES WE'VE ALL HAD TO MAKE FUNDING WE WOULD HAVE HOPE TO GET FOR OUR DISTRICTS AND FOR WAR THE PROJECTS I OUR DISTRICTS. BUT WE'RE MAKING THE BEST OUT OF A BAD SITUATION COLLEAGUES I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MINING SENATOR WILK YOU HAD% YOUR MIKE UP YOUR GOOD EXCELLENT SENATOR TORONTO. HELLO THANK YOU AND CHAIR THIS IS MY SECOND YEAR. IN THE SENATE AND THE LEGISLATURE AND THE- WE GET HIT WITH THIS PANDEMIC. AND THE PANDEMIC BEEN AS A RESULT OF THE DECISIONS EVERYBODY WE ALL HAD TO MAKE. BECOMES ONE OF THE WORST ECONOMIC MOMENTS- IN OUR LIFETIMES FOR SURE. WHEN I SAW THAT THIS WAS GOING TO RESULT THE- BUDGET WOULD RESULT IN A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SHORTAGE. IT WAS THE QUITE SO BRING TO TRY AND THINK HOW IN THE WORLD ARE WE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS. SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL. TO OUR BUDGET CHAIR MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES. I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO THE PRO TEM TO THE STAFF TO OUR LEADERSHIP. FOR THE WAY THAT THEY APPROACHED THIS BUDGET THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS. MANY CUTS WERE PROPOSED THAT WERE JUST DOWNRIGHT CRUEL. THEY WERE CRUEL TO OUR SENIORS THREATENING TO FOR THEM TO LOSE THEIR DAY SERVICES. CRUEL TO THE EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR YOUTH. CRUEL TO MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN POVERTY. AND MOST OF THOSE CUTS OVERWHELMINGLY WERE STOPPED. ON A DIFFERENT CHORUS AND A DIFFERENT MODEL WAS USED TO ADDRESS THIS TERRIBLE TIME IN OUR ECONOMY. ONE OF THOSE WITH TO ADDRESS MEN AND WOMEN WHO LIVE IN POVERTY AND SOMETIMES EXTREME POVERTY. BUT WILL WORK. THE WORK FOR A LIVING. THIS-BUDGET ATTEMPTS TO INCLUDE ALL CALIFORNIANS FOR ALL OF THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. SENATE ATTEMPTS TO SAY TO GOOD EMPLOYERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IS GOOD EMPLOYERS WHO RESPECT THE LAWS GOOD EMPLOYERS TO PAY GOOD WAGES AND GOOD BENEFITS. BUT IT ALSO SAYS TO THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE NOT LIVING UP TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. WHO ARE BREAKING THE LAW ON WHO ARE CHEATING. THAT YOU HAVE TO YOU GOTTA CHANGE YOUR EVIL WAYS. IN LA ALONE LOS ANGELES ALONE ON A WEEKLY BASIS THIS TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN WAGE THEFT. A LOS ANGELES ALONE TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN WAGE THEFT. TO PROPOSE IN OUR BUDGET THAT THERE BE COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD LABOR LAWS I THINK IS THE LEAST THAT WE COULD DO FOR THOSE OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK SO HARD. I HAVE TALKED OF NOT ONLY FARMWORKERS I'VE TALKED TO GARNER WORKERS. NUMBER WORKERS YOUR AVERAGING FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. RESTAURANT WORKERS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS FARMWORKERS YOU CAN GO ON AND ON AND ON. THEY DESERVE WHAT THEY SHOULD GET FOR THE HARD WORK THAT THEY DO FOR THIS ECONOMY FOR THE STATE. SO BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE- I DON'T AGREE WITH EVERY SINGLE THING IN THIS BUDGET. BUT I DO THINK THAT IT IS A TEMPLATE. BUT WE IT'S NOT OVER AND THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK IN THIS DIRECTION NOT IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE WERE FIRST ASKED TO CONSIDER. I WILL ABSOLUTELY VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DURACELL SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT IN MEMBERS- I DON'T TYPICALLY GET UP. ON THE FLOOR TO TALK AND- WE'LL JUST HAVE A FEW WERE TO SAY THAT A PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO FIRST START OUT BY SAYING THANK YOU TO. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE MADAM PRO TEM AND ALL THE BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN THE BUDGET TEAM IN THE SENATE FOR ALL THEIR WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE OVER THESE PAST MANY MONTHS. AT THIS IS NOT A BUDGET THAT ANY OF US EXPECTED IT IS A BUDGET THAT WE INHERITED IN TOGETHER WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS. BUT I WANNA ADDRESS A FEW ITEMS THAT WERE DISCUSSED ON THE FLOOR TODAY. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE MAJORITY PARTY IN HIS THE MAJORITY PARTY STAND UP FOR THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIA. ELECTED JUST QUICKLY TOUCHING. WHILE THE MAJORITY PARTY CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER IN THE MAJORITY PARTY CAN ALWAYS WORK HARD. THE MAJORITY PARTY HAS THE LARGEST. MARGINS IN BOTH LEGISLATIVE HOUSES IN DECADES. EVERY CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS REPRESENTED BY MAJORITY PARTY. WHY IS THAT. WELL BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIANS. VALUES OF CALIFORNIANS. IN THIS JUST BE CANDID WE'RE GONNA BE CAN'T IN THIS BUDGET CONVERSES. THE MAJORITY OF COMMERCE THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE REVOLTED. EVERY VOTED AGAINST THE MINORITY PARTIES. THE MORNING MINORITY PARTY'S AGENDA ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR COMPANY. CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA WAS ALWAYS IN THE TOP THREE IN JOB GROWTH IN FACT NUMBER ONE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. 25% OF AMERICA'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT DOESN'T COME FROM KENTUCKY. INDIANA NEVADA IT COMES FROM THE GOLDEN STATE CALIFORNIA. WHO HAS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT THAT. IT'S CALIFORNIA. LARGER THAN GREAT BRITAIN. WHO HAD THE RECORD LOW EMPLOYMENT RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS CALIFORNIA. THE MEDIAN INCOME FOR THE UNITED STATES FOR A FAMILY IS FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE GOLDEN STATE WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT THAT SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE NINE BAY AREA COUNTIES THE NINE BAY AREA COUNTIES. WERE ITS OWN. FEDERAL CONNIE IT HAD THE NINETEENTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THAT TODAY. THE NINETEENTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. THANKS TO THE VOTERS WHO REPRESENT THE VALUES OF THE STATE WE HAD A NINETEEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR RAINY DAY FUND. WE PAY DOWN SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN PURRS DEBT OVER THE LAST THIRTY SIX MONTHS WE PAY DOWN FIVE POINT TWO BILLION IN STIRS DEBT STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM DEBT. OVER THE LAST THIRTY SIX MONTHS IS THAT ENOUGH ABSOLUTELY NOT. BUT THAT'S BEEN LED BY THE MAJORITY PART. WHEN WE LET'S KEEP TALKING ABOUT SCHOOLS. IT'S SHAMEFUL THAT CALIFORNIA WAS DEAD LAST YES EIGHT YEARS AGO IN THE NATION BEHIND MISSISSIPPIAN PER PEOPLE SPENDING. THIS YEAR RECORD LEVELS MANY RECORD LEVEL IN SPENDING. ON A K. TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS IT ENOUGH HELL NO WE MUST GO FURTHER. BUT IS MAJORITY PARTY THAT IS STOOD STRONG FOR THAT PUSH THAT FORWARD THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR C. D. TEN THOUSAND MORE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SLOTS FIVE THOUSAND MORE SLOTS AT THE UC'S. WE TALK ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY IT'S NEVER BEEN GREATER IN THIS NATION IN HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. THANKS TO THE MAJORITY PARTY MEMBERS IN THIS. IN THIS HOLLOW GROUND. WE FOUGHT FOR THE LARGEST EQUAL PAY LAW IN AMERICA IS STRONG CASE EQUAL PAY LAW IN AMERICA AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE TWO THIRDS OF MINIMUM WAGE EARNERS IN THE STATE. ARE WOMEN. WE'VE EXPANDED HEALTH CARE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE. WE'VE INVESTED RECORD AMOUNTS IN HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO MEMBERS. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE BALLING. INSULTS BACK AND FORTH IS ABOUT WORKING TOGETHE ESPECIALLY IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. WE'RE STANDING STRONG FOR IMMIGRANTS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST MAJORITY MINORITY STATES IN THE NEXT DECADE. AND IT'S TIME FOR ALL OF US TO WAKE UP. WAKE UP AND COME TO THAT POINT. NINE IN THE RIGHT HERE. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW POLITICAL HOW POLITICAL THIS NATION HAS BECOME. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I AM SUCH A PROUD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATES IN IS BECAUSE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER BUT THERE'S A GOOD SENATOR FROM ORANGE COUNTY. GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO. WE WORK TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO GET AS MUCH AS WE CAN DOWN FOR CALIFORNIA. THE ONE THING I'LL JUST SAY IS WELL WE MAY HAVE DISAGREEMENTS ON THIS BUDGET. WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS HERE TODAY IN THE MONTHS TO COME TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH. THE CHALLENGING MONTHS AHEAD. THE LAST THING THAT CALIFORNIANS WANT. THIS PARTISAN BICKERING THEY GET ENOUGH FOR THAT IN WASHINGTON DC BUT STORAGE. LET'S WORK TO. VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU CENTER REQUIRE MEMBERS ANY FURTHER. OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE. CENTER SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT ON. I APPRECIATE THE KNOWLEDGE MEANT FOR MY WORK IN THE WORK OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE NOW THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS CHAIR OF A COMMITTEE YOU KNOW THE WORK IT TAKES ON TO DO THE PEOPLE'S WORK IN TO A REVIEW BILLSAND JUST TO DO YOUR JOB WITH INTEGRITY THOUGHT APPRECIATE THE TALISMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LET ME PLEASE THANK THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. OUR STAFF. WHO SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS PREPARING DOCUMENTS FOR OUR REVIEW. LET ME BE CLEAR DOCUMENTS FOR OUR REVIEW BECAUSE WE ARE THE DULY ELECTED MEMBERS OF THIS BODY WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING DECISIONS AND TAKING THE VOTE. I FEEL A- OBLIGATION AS CHAIR BUDGET COMMITTEE. WHEN WE VOTE ON THE BUDGET BILLING CHIEF. AFTER HEARING SOME OF THE DISCUSSION AND DEBATE TO DO TWO THINGS. THE SEPARATE FICTION FROM FACT. AT THE SEPARATE PROCESS FROM CONTENT. FACT AS A RESULT OF THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWO TWENTY FIVE. THE BUDGET BILL MUST BE IN PRINT FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS. AND SO WHILE WE OFTEN STAND ON THIS FLOOR AND WAX FOR FROM THE FAILED BECAUSE THE GOOD OLD DAYS WERE GREAT THE GOOD OLD DAYS DID CREATE A SCENARIO WHERE YOU WOULD COME ON THE FLOOR AND SEE A BUDGET DOCKING TO SHOULD DEVOTE ON. THIS BILL HAS BEEN IN PRINT. FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS. THAT'S FACT. FACT THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF JUNE FIFTEENTH HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROCESS AND CONTENT. THIS IS MY TENTH BUDGET I'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW MANY BUDGET THERE HAD BEEN. AND EVERY YEAR THERE IS A CHALLENGE THE PROCESS. WHETHER WE HAVE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THEN THERE'S A CHALLENGE TO THE AGENDA AND HOW THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WITH DESIGNED AND RUN. IF IT'S A BIG NEGOTIATION THEN PEOPLE ONE BIG FIVE THAT THAT'S A BIG FIVE PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING NOW. AND SO SUFFICE IT TO SAY OVER MY YEAR EXPERIENCE. THE PRESS. WILL ALWAYS BE CHALLENGING. I SORT OF WANT TO SAY GET OVER IT BUT I WON'T WHAT I WILL SAY IS THIS YEAR WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE WHITE WAS A CHALLENGE IT WAS NO FAULT OF OUR OWN. AND EVERYONE WHO HAS THE DULY ELECTED RESPONSIBILITY OF CASTING A VOTE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS STEP UP AND REPRESENT YOUR CONSTITUENTS. CONTENT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DIG DEEP IN DEBATE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE CONTENT CONVERSATION THAT'S FACT BASED. THAT MOST OF THE NEW FUNDING THAT'S BEEN REFERENCE HERE ON THE FLOOR TODAY OUR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF CHAPTER TWO BILLS. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO IT IN EXPAND STATE EMPLOYEE SERVICE TO DO THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT DON'T INTRODUCED A BILL THAT DOES SO. EITHER CHAPTER BILL THAT ARE LAW THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO THE MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO GET THE WORK DONE THAT'S FACT IF YOU WANT TO DATE THE INTEGRITY OF THE BILL THAT'S ALREADY A LAW. BIG KNOWLEDGE THAT LET'S DO THAT SEPARATE. I APPRECIATE IN VALUE ALL THE IDEAS ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING WAYS THAT OTHER STATES ARE MAY BE MORE EFFICIENT OR EFFECTIVE AND ADMINISTERING GOVERNOR GOVERNMENT. I APPRECIATE HEARING ALTHOUGH TODAY OF OUR OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT AND MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT'S BEFORE US IN SB SEVENTY FOUR. LET'S TALK ABOUT VALUES I THINK THAT'S FAIR. IF YOU TRULY VALUE INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA SMALL FRAGILE. THEN I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU CAN'T SUPPORT A BILL. THAT KEEP DOES INDEED KEEP ARE NEEDED VETERANS HOME OPEN. THAT DOES CONTINUE THE FUN THE MSF P. PROGRAM FOR SENIORS TO KEEP THEM OUT OF NURSING HOMES. THE DESK CONTINUE TO FIND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. THE DOES CONTINUE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION AT THE TWENTY NINETEEN FUNDING LEVELS. A BUDGET THAT DOES EXPAND CHILDCARE SLOTS FOR OUR SIN TO WORKERS. SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO THEIR WORK A BUDGET THAT DOES SLOTS FOR ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PRO. WHO QUALIFY FOR THOSE PRO. PEOPLE WHO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY. A BUDGET THAT DOES PROVIDE A 5% BASE INCREASED TO OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING YOU SEE AND SEE IF YOU. CAN PROVIDE AND MAINTAINS THE CAL GRANT AWARD FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND PRIVATE COLLEGES. A BUDGET THAT DOES INCLUDE. LET THAT ELIMINATED THAT RESTORED THE CUT THAT WAS PROPOSED IN MAY REVISED JUST SAYS WORKERS AGAIN HELPING THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE STAY IN THEIR HOMES. A BUDGET THAT DOES INCLUDE. I COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. TO THE SSI PORTION OF THE SS I SS P. ELIGIBLE IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. A VOTE AGAINST BUT- SINCE THE MESSAGE ABOUT VALUES. A VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET DOES ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR SUPPORT A PROVIDING TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND TO THE HOLES IN THE EARLY START SPECIALIZED THERAPEUTIC SERVICES INTO DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. A VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET TECHNOLOGIST SAVINGS OF ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THANKS TO THE M. C. O. TAX. A VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET. PROVIDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE HEARING AIDS TO CHILDREN WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE. A VOTE AGAINST THIS BUDGET IS A VALUE STATEMENT. A VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET MAINTAINS GENERAL FUND SPENDING ON MEDICARE OUT OPTIONAL BENEFITS WHAT THE MEDI CAL OPTIONAL BENEFIT. DENTAL BENEFITS OPTOMETRY. OPTICIANS INCONTINENCE CREAMS AND WASHES DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAMS. A VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET. MAINTAINS THE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER. A VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET PROVIDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CITIES FOR HOMELESSNESS PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES TO COMBAT COLBERT NINETEEN. ALL VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR HOMELESSNESS. A VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET. INCLUDES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE AYE BANK AND GRANTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES. ASSISTANCE THROUGH THEIR SMALL FINANCE. AND SO. I APPRECIATE ALL OF THOSE OF YOU WHO IN JANUARY HAD BRIGHT CREATIVE IDEAS ABOUT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS FOR YOUR DISTRICTS I HAD THOSE IDEAS TO. BUT LET ME BE CLEAR THERE IS NO PORK IN THIS BUDGET. NONE OF US GOT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO INVEST IN THESE INNOVATION INNOVATIVE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS THAT ARE CONSTITUENTS CAN USE AND DESERVE. THIS BUDGET IS THE BEST WE CAN DO. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T BECAUSE EXTRA ON-DO HARM ON TO THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN VICTIMIZED. EITHER ECONOMICALLY OR THROUGH THEIR OWN PUBLIC HEALTH AS A RESULT OF THE VIRUS. THIS IS NOT WHERE WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE IN JANUARY. BUT COLLEAGUES IS WHERE WE ARE TODAY. AND SO WE WANT TO TALK VALUES WE WANT TO TALK PROCESS WE CAN DO THAT. A STATE LEGISLATORS WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO LEGISLATE AN APPROPRIATE AND ON JUNE FIFTEENTH WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO REVIEW THE SPENDING PLAN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
