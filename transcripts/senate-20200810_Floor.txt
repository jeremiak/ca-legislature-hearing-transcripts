THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I DON'T USUALLY SPEAK AGAINST APPOINTMENTS AND I SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENT CANDIDATES WHEN THE PERSON IS QUALIFIED I RESPECT THE PRIVILEGE OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THIS PROCESS AND BELIEVE A ROLE AS A CO EQUAL BRANCH SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS IN TYING UP APPOINTMENTS. THE COLLEAGUES I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS PARTICULAR APPOINTMENT. LAST YEAR AFTER REVIEWING THE REVENUE NUMBERS AT THE STATE LOTTERY AND THEIR ALLOCATION TO SCHOOLS IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT THE NUMBERS DID NOT ADD UP. REVENUE SKYROCKETED FOR THE LOTTERY TO STORABLE LEVELS BUT REVENUE TO SCHOOLS REMAIN FLAT. I WORK WITH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE TO DIRECT THE STATE AUDITOR TO LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE. IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND PROTOCOLS. AND I THE TIME TO OUTLINE OF THOSE. BUT IT BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT THE LOTTERY OWES OUR STUDENTS AT LEAST THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S MONEY FOR SUPPLIES TEACHERS. AND TECHNOLOGY IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS SHORTCHANGED BY THE LOTTERY. INSTEAD OF RECOGNIZING WHAT THE STATE AUDITOR AND COVERED IN PAYING BACK OUR SCHOOLS. STATE LOTTERY ATTORNEYS UNDER MISTER JOHNSON'S LEADERSHIP FOUND EXCUSES. AND KEPT THE MONEY AND THEN TURNED AROUND AND HEARD EVEN MORE STAFF ATTORNEYS AND IN HOUSE OTHER PROFESSIONALS. AND OUR SCHOOLS WILL SEE THOSE FUNDS. AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO GET SHORT CHANGED UNTIL THERE ARE SERIOUS CHANGES. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE RULES COMMITTEE FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION ON THIS APPOINTMENT AND SOME MEMBERS DID ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT CHANGES MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION AND WORK. I UNDERSTAND MR JOHNSON HAS A LONG RESPECTABLE CAREER BEFORE HIS TIME AT THE LOTTERY AND HE WILL LOOK TO THAT AS YOU CAST YOUR VOTE. I CAN KNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD BE THESE. ONES WILL BE LAYING OFF PLANE TODAY. HE SAID CHANG CENTER SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST WANT TO STAND ON VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR MISTER JOHNSON WHO AS MY COLLEAGUE SAYS DOES HAVE A LONG DISTINGUISHED CAREER ON IN STATE SERVICE IN THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW THE LOTTERY HAS FOR- A NUMBER OF YEARS HAD MANY CHALLENGES AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALL CHALLENGE THEM IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THEY ARE DOING. WHAT'S RIGHT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE VOTERS IN TERMS OF DIRECTING AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE TO SCHOOLS ARE THINGS TO JOHNSON IN HIS NEW LEADERSHIP THERE WILL LEAD US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND DON'T THINK HE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR OUR SHORTCOMINGS OF THE LOTTERY IMPASSE PAPRIKA PASS DIRECTORS SO I WILL PROBABLY BE CAP ABOUT IT SUPPORT BUSINESS JOHNSON CONFIRMATION TODAY. THANK YOU SIR MITCHELL SO BRAD. THANK YOU MISS PRESIDENT I TOO WANT TO STAND IN FRONT SUPPORT OF MR JOHNSON SOMEONE AND I'M KNOWN FOR NUMEROUS YEARS HAVE BEEN A- PROFESSIONAL ALL ASPECTS OF HIS CAREER INDIVIDUAL WHO'S VERY- WILLING TO ENGAGE IN. AND IT'S JUST ACCOUNTABLE AND TOO LATE IS BURDEN OF THE MISMANAGEMENT OF THE LOTTERY OR WHATEVER IT'S PERCEIVED TO BE MISMANAGEMENT ON HIS- DOOR HAS A NEWLY APPOINTED. CORRECT I THINK IS UNFAIR AND WE'VE ALL VOICED CONCERNS OVER THE YEARS OVER BELLOTTO SO I THINK MR JOHNSON THE RIGHT LEADER AT THE RIGHT TIME TO MOVE. THE CALIFORNIA LOTTERY IN THAT RIGHT DIRECTION SUCH STRONG ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SIR BRADFORD SEEING NO OTHER. US SENATOR JONES SEARCH SERVICE PRESIDENT I JUST WANTED TO- RISE IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT COMMENTS FROM OUR CALLING FROM DIAMOND BAR AND THEN ALSO THE OTHER COMMENTS- FROM ALL OF OUR.

THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU CENTER JONES SEEING NO OTHER MIKES UP. MATTER PRO TEM DO YOU WANT TO CLOSE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I WOULD LIKE TO. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES I WOULD DIRE- REITERATE A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE. THERE REALLY WAS A ROBOT AND EXTENSIVE CONVERSATION OF THE RULES COMMITTEE. HI AS IT RELATES TO A NUMBER OF ISSUES I WOULD SAY. IN TERMS OF THE DISCUSSION AND THE AUDIT. I THERE IS A DISPUTE OVER THE METHODOLOGY OF. HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE DOLLARS. THAT IS SOMETHING THE CONTROLLER HAS BROUGHT UP THAT IS SOMETHING THE AUDITOR. OBVIOUSLY PUT OUT THERE IS A NEW STUDY UNDER WAY- OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE ISSUES THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. OVERSEE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. FIVE AT THE SAME TIME. I WOULD SAY THAT- MR JOHNSON IS THE NEW DIRECTOR BEING APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. I HE ALSO SPOKE TO A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE SEEN DISPLAYED. PUBLICLY ABOUT THE CULTURE OF- THAT DEPARTMENT. THE MORALE OF THE STAFF AND I THINK THAT MR JOHNSON ACTUALLY- RESPONDED QUITE WELL TO THOSE COMMENTS THE CONCERNS AND WHILE I. UNDERSTAND THE VOTE OF MIKE. I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE PRESENTATION THAT HE MADE THE- RESPONSES HE GAVE TO US. AND THERE MAY BE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO IS A LEGISLATOR.
