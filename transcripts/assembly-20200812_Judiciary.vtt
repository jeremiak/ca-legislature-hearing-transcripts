COMPLY WITH THAT SO MY QUESTION

00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:51.001
IS. IT COULD JUST BE USED AS A

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.469

LANDLORDS ARE DOING THAT RIGHT

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.653
NOW WITHOUT THIS BILL SOLD THIS

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.189
WOULD PROHIBIT THEM AT ALL

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:13.624
THAT'S WHAT THEY CHOSE TO DO IT.

00:43:13.691 --> 00:43:14.558
OKAY BUT THE BILL SAYS

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:15.626
SOMETHING OVERALL REGION THAT

THE LANDLORD SHALL COMPLY. SO

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:28.405

THIS BILL BEING ENACTED YES

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:29.533
THEY COULD CONTINUE TO DO THAT

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.934
RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS

UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL AND

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:45.749

00:44:58.962 --> 00:45:00.364
FEE IS NOT PAID THAT

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:02.232
DELINQUENCY CANNOT BE REPORTED

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:03.200
TO A CREDIT AGENCY I WAS

UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE THE CASE

00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:10.741
IT SAYS THAT- ATTENDANT. CAN

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:13.877

00:45:15.245 --> 00:45:16.513
WOULD BE I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.482
TEN DOLLARS I MEAN WHY WOULD WE

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:20.117
REPORT TIME ANYWAY I MEAN WE

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:21.585
TALK ABOUT A TEN DOLLAR PAYMENT

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:23.320
WELL IT'S ACTUALLY SO IT'S KIND

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:24.521
OF A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT I

00:45:24.588 --> 00:45:26.123
THINK IF WE'RE TELLING. OUR%

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.658
CREDITORS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:29.159
THEY ARE UNABLE TO REPORT A

00:45:29.226 --> 00:45:31.395
NEGATIVE PAYMENT HISTORY ON A

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:34.031
ON A BORROWER- YOU KNOW I DON'T

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:34.798
THINK THAT THAT'S THE PURPOSE

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:36.733
OF I WOULD CREDIT AGENCIES DO I

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.735
CAN HEAR SOME OF THE BEST OF MY

00:45:38.802 --> 00:45:40.070
THE ROOT OF MY DISCOMFORT WITH

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:42.005
THIS BILL. IS THAT IT SEEMS

00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:43.440
LIKE IT'S DELIBERATELY WORDED

00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:44.942
SO THAT ONLY POSITIVE PAYMENT

00:45:45.008 --> 00:45:47.911
HISTORY CAN BE REPORTED. AND I

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:49.012
THINK THAT THAT COMPLETELY

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.314
MOVES THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.682
BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO HELP

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:54.451
PEOPLE BUILD A CREDIT HISTORY.

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:56.386
AND CREDIT BUREAUS KNOW THAT.

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:58.522
ONLY POSITIVE. PAYMENT HISTORY

00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:59.756
CAN BE REPORTED THAT THEY'RE

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:00.691
JUST GOING TO COMPLETELY

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:02.292
DISCOUNT THAT PAYMENT HISTORY.

00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:03.026
WHEN THEY'RE COMPLETING A

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.595
CREDIT SCORE ANYWAY. BECAUSE I

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:05.996
MEAN AND THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:07.331
EXPERTS THEY'RE NOT STUPID THEY

00:46:07.397 --> 00:46:08.298
THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING

00:46:08.365 --> 00:46:09.666
ON HERE AND SO. I WOULD

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:10.534
ENCOURAGE YOU TO BILL MOVES

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:11.835
FORWARD TO FIX THOSE

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:13.036
DEFICIENCIES BECAUSE I REALLY

00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:15.072
THINK THAT- THAT INCLUDES THE

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:16.673
WHOLE POINT AFTER. YOU'RE

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.442
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE WITH THIS

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:21.912
BILL. BUT THANK YOU THIS RACE.

00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:24.414
ON I WANT TO THANK YOU THIS IS

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:26.116
VERY CREATIVE I THINK WHEN WE

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:28.318
HAVE TENANTS WHO HAVE DONE THE

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:30.020
RIGHT THING IN PAYING THE RENT

00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:33.190
ON TIME NEVER GET ANY CREDIT I

00:46:33.257 --> 00:46:34.391
WAS LISTENING TO THE

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:36.960
OPPOSITION- AND EVERY REASON

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:38.428
GIVEN WAS THE REASON WHY THIS

00:46:38.495 --> 00:46:41.331
BILL NEEDS TO BE ENACTED IS

00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:43.734
THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.336
AFFORD SO MUCH BUT WHEN THEY

00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:47.371
FINALLY GET TO THE POINT WHERE

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:48.839
THEY CAN'T AFFORD THEY HAVE THE

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:50.874
WORST CREDIT SCORE BECAUSE ALL

00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:51.441
THAT'S BEEN REPORTED OR THE

00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:53.710
NEGATIVE THINGS WE KNOW THAT

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:54.811
AND LANDLORDS DON'T ALWAYS

00:46:54.878 --> 00:46:56.413
REPORT THE NEGATIVE. BUT SOME

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.815
OF THEM DO AND THEY WILL NEVER

00:46:58.882 --> 00:47:00.584
REPORT THE POSITIVE IT'S

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:02.586
UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE TO

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:04.154
HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.889
THEM TO ALSO REPORT THE

00:47:05.956 --> 00:47:08.592
POSITIVE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:10.594
FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL. THANK

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:14.431
YOU. THANK YOU OKAY. I MISSED

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.465
REFERENCE ONE TO GIVE YOU A

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:16.366
CHANCE TO RESPOND TO THE

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:17.534
ARGUMENT FROM THE OPPOSITION

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:19.069
THAT- AND THIS WILL ACTUALLY

00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:21.238
END UP HURTING- FOLKS WHO DON'T

00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:23.140
DECIDE TO OPT IN. NO I DON'T I

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:24.608
DON'T THINK IT AT ALL AND I'M

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.276
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ANALYSIS

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:28.145
THAT IF YOU WERE. LIVING IN

00:47:28.212 --> 00:47:30.013
SUBSIDIZED HOUSING TODAY YOU'LL

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.348
FOREVER LIVE IN SUBSIDIZED

00:47:31.415 --> 00:47:34.218
HOUSING AS THERE'S NO BENEFIT.

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:35.619
OF GETTING YOUR DIRECT.

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.988
REPORTED AN ALMOST STATING THAT

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:39.523
YOU'RE DSTINED TO BE POOR

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:40.457
THEY'RE MEMBERS OF THIS

00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:42.326
LEGISLATURE WHO LIVED IN

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:44.394
SUBSIDIZED HOUSING AND TO DATE

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:46.396
NO LONGER LIVE THERE SO THIS IS

00:47:46.463 --> 00:47:48.265
A OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:50.234
TO ESTABLISH CREDIT. AND TO

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.436
BUILD THE AMERICAN DREAM OF.

00:47:52.502 --> 00:47:54.438
HOMEOWNERSHIP OR ACQUIRING

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:56.473
PROPERTY SO THIS IS IMPORTANT

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.976
MEASURES CHAU. SO I IF I AM I

00:47:59.042 --> 00:47:59.977

00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:02.546
BUT I THOUGHT WHAT HE SAID AND-

00:48:02.613 --> 00:48:03.780
I DIDN'T ITEMS TO CONSENT TO

00:48:03.847 --> 00:48:05.482
CORRECTIVE I'M WRONG IS THAT-

00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:07.384
IF YOU HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:09.553
OFTEN- AND OTHERS WHO DON'T

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.222

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:14.925

THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE

WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:05.889

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:50.439
I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS QUITE

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:52.174
A BIT OF WORK LEFT TO BE DONE

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.676
AND I THINK WE- THREE STAFF IN

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:55.477
IN TALKING TO HAS EXPRESSED

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:57.245
SOME OF THAT. I WORRY THAT

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:58.747
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH HERE FOR THE

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:02.351
SMALLEST OF THE LANDLORDS. AND

01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:03.485
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:04.987
WE'RE NOT SETTING UP SOMETHING

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:05.787
THAT WE SEEN ON THE FEDERAL

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:07.789
LEVEL WHERE THOSE WHO HAVE THE

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:09.624
MOST RESOURCES ARE GETTING THE

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.727
MOST OF. THE RELIEF MONEY THAT

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.962
THAT CANNOT BE THE MODEL. HERE

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:17.499
IN CALIFORNIA. AND SHE TAKEN

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:18.433
SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS OF THAT

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.968
WE PUT IN TO PROVIDE SOME

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:21.870
ADDITIONAL TENANT PROTECTIONS

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:23.538
BUT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL BILL

01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:25.841
THAT REALLY IS THE SAME SUBJECT

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:26.842
AND THAT'S MESSAGES BILL THAT'S

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:29.411
IN THE SENATE THAT THAT. NEEDS

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:32.514
TO BE. BROUGHT NECESSARILY TO

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:33.482
THIS BILL BUT NEEDS TO BE

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:35.350
CONSIDERED AT THE SAME TIME

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:36.485
BECAUSE IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:38.286
PROTECT. LANDLORDS WE NEED TO

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:38.754
MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:43.425
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN FOR

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.926
FROM LOSING THEIR- THEIR

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:46.795
HOUSING I. I KNOW IN FROM YOUR

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:48.263
STATEMENTS THAT THE SHARED SOME

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.399
OF THOSE BUT THIS IS A- NEED TO

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:52.034
BE A MULTI FACETED APPROACH IT

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.302
IS A VERY COMPLEX APPROACH AND-

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:55.370
I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:56.805
AS WE MOVE FORWARD I'M GLAD THE

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:58.707
GOVERNOR'S ENGAGED IN THIS. YOU

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:01.710
MAY. NOT BE BUT HAD TO TRY AND

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:03.278
BRING. THE BROUGHT THE POLICIES

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:05.113
TOGETHER AND ENSURE THAT THAT

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.949
WE HAVE A PACKAGE THAT THIS

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:08.517
LEGISLATURE OVERALL CAN BE

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:11.853
PROUD OF THIS THAT THAT'S

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.889
REALLY THE GOAL LIKE I KNOW

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:14.489
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE

01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:19.661
TO CONVERSE. WE TRYING TO. SO

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:23.231
MISCONDUCTS. SENATOR I WANT TO

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:25.767
PREFACE THIS WITH- I KNOW YOU

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:26.935
WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THIS IS

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:30.072
NOT- MY CONCERNS WITH THE BILL

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:31.573
ARE NOT YOUR INTENT WITH THE

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.642
BILL- AND SO I WANT TO MAKE

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:34.609
SURE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:38.814
THINGS I'M A SE- ARE A COMMON

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.749
CONCERN WITH OUR LATINO CAUCUS

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:44.953
AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS SO. I

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:49.357
ABSOLUTELY CANNOT. SUPPORT AND

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:53.595
F. THAT HAS OR SEEKS TO HELP A

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:55.530
SMALL PORTION OF TENANTS THAT

01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:57.032
DON'T INCLUDE THOSE WITHOUT

01:18:57.099 --> 01:19:00.202
DOCUMENTATION I JUST I CANNOT

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:01.269
AND WILL NOT DO THAT DOESN'T

01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:02.771
MEAN I WON'T VOTE FOR TODAY TO

01:19:02.838 --> 01:19:03.872
MOVE ON BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S A

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:05.574
BIG CONCERN BUT WE ARE SEEN

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.343
SYSTEMATICALLY AS YOU KNOW- A

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.745
SECTION OF OUR COMMUNITY- E

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:12.547
ACTUALLY CALLED- ESSENTIAL

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:14.282
WORKERS WHO ARE BEING LEFT OUT

01:19:14.349 --> 01:19:16.585
OF EVERY RELIEF PACKAGE THAT

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:17.252
COMES THROUGH THE FEDERAL

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:19.187
GOVERNMENT WHOSE FAMILIES ARE

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:21.623
BEING JEOPARDIZED- BY IT BY

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:23.892
THEIR EFFORTS IN OUR OWN- SOME

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:25.927
OF HIS FAMILY MEMBERS OF COURSE

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:27.529
MANY WHOSE. KIDS ARE GOING TO

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:31.433
BE U. S. CITIZENS. ANY PAY

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.268
TAXES IN DIFFERENT FORMS- I'M

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.337
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME TWEAKS

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:36.938
THAT I TEN FILERS MIGHT BE ABLE

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:40.008
TO. OPERATE UNDER THIS BUT- I

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.243
THINK IT'S A HARD LINE THAT

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:42.644
MANY OF US HAVE CHOSEN TO TAKE

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:44.279
WITHIN THE CAUCUS AT THIS POINT

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:46.047
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN BANGING THE

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:48.283
DRUM FOR SO LONG AND IT SEEMS

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:51.153
LIKE. THESE PROPOSALS STILL-

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:53.388
NEGLECT THE DEEP AND

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:54.923
DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT THAT

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:56.591
IT'S HAVING ON MEMBERS OF OUR

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:59.327
COMMUNITY INCLUDING- THOSE WHO

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:00.128
ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND MIXED

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:02.430
STATUS HOUSEHOLDS- SO THAT'S A

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:03.932
STATEMENT BUT AGAIN YOU YOU

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:05.367
ADDRESSED IT AND I UNDERSTAND

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:07.502
THAT. YOU ADDRESS YOUR COMMENTS

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:08.103
THAT THAT WAS NOT YOUR YOUR

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:10.172
PURPOSE. I AM EQUALLY

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:12.307
CONCERNED- THAT IT WILL LEAVE

01:20:12.374 --> 01:20:14.342
OUT THE POOREST OF OUR

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:15.410
COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO DON'T

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:19.047
FILE TAXES. AND SO I SPENT A

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:19.981
LONG TIME TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:23.185
HOW. THIS WORKS- THAT THAT'S

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:24.419
ANOTHER CONCERN MY LIKE HOW

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.021
QUICKLY WE CAN GET THIS UP AND

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:28.089
RUNNING AND ACTUALLY UTILIZE

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:30.058
GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF IT. AND

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.060
THEN ON TOP OF THAT HOW WE

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:35.263
ADDRESS THESE POPULATIONS WHO-

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:36.498
DON'T HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:39.634
NUMBER. I ALSO WANT TO WARN AS

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:40.635
WE MOVE FORWARD THAT IT WOULD

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:43.171
BE UNACCEPTABLE IN MY MIND TO

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:47.943
FORCE- TENANTS TO INFORM THEIR

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:48.543
LANDLORDS THAT ARE

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:52.013
UNDOCUMENTED- I HAPPEN TO. HAVE

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.181
LIVED THROUGH AN ERA IN SAN

01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:55.183
DIEGO COUNTY- WHERE THERE WAS

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:59.321
EFFORTS TO. PENALIZE AT FIRST

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:02.023
FOR LANDLORDS TO. PARTICIPATE

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:04.826
IN IN THE EFFORTS TO INFORM-

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:05.493
AGENTS OF PEOPLE'S

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.596
DOCUMENTATION STATUS AND WE

01:21:07.662 --> 01:21:09.297
HAVE A NUMBER OF. OF

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:12.200
INDIVIDUALS- I FEAR THE PEOPLE

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:13.134
WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:14.936
IMMIGRATION STATUS WILL LEAVE

01:21:15.003 --> 01:21:19.241
THEIR RESIDENTS TO BECOME- WITH

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:20.575
THAT HOMELESS. RATHER THAN

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:21.576
SHARE THAT IN. WITH THEIR

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:23.111
FAMILY SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:24.846
MOVING FORWARD- I THINK IT

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:27.048
MOVES IF IT MOVES TODAY IT

01:21:27.115 --> 01:21:27.649
WOULD MOVE TO MIGHT COMMITTEE-

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.785
BUT I KNOW YOU CARE DEEPLY

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:34.356
ABOUT ALL. CALIFORNIANS

01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:34.823
ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST

01:21:34.889 --> 01:21:36.157
VULNERABLE AND SO. I'M GLAD

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:37.826
YOU'RE THE AUTHOR- BUT I'M I'M

01:21:37.892 --> 01:21:40.161
VERY NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BILL.

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:44.332
AND ANY RELIEF IT SEEKS TO. IT

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:45.634
SEEKS TO HELP I DON'T THINK

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.068
IT'S BROAD ENOUGH I THINK

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:49.471
RENTAL RELIEF AND KEEPING

01:21:49.537 --> 01:21:51.072
PEOPLE THEIR HOUSES CAN AND

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:51.906
SHOULD BE OUR NUMBER ONE

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.441
PRIORITY RIGHT NOW IN IN THIS

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:55.443
LEGISLATURE- IT IS THE ONE

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.112
THING WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR TO

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:58.580
KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED IN AND THEN

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:00.282
FED THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS I

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:02.417
THINK AS WE MOVE INTO. A TIME

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:03.752
OF ECONOMIC CRISIS WE'RE GOING

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:05.587
TO HAVE TO FACE OUT SO THOSE

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:07.789
ARE MY COMMENTS- IF I PREFER

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:09.591
NOT TO EVEN VOTE FOR THIS IN

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.926
THIS FORM I WON'T BE THE REASON

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:14.996
THAT THAT'LL DIES- SO IF I NEED

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:15.897
TO VOTE FOR TO MOVE IT ON I

01:22:15.964 --> 01:22:17.632
WILL BUT- I KNOW YOU TAKE THESE

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.401
ISSUES SERIOUSLY AND I HOPE WE

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:20.769
CAN WORK ON OVER THE NEXT. WEEK

01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:22.137
TO GET INTO A POSITION WHERE WE

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:26.107
CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE. RIGHT IN

01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:32.247
FRONT OF. OKAY. THIS OBERNOLTE

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:35.317
THAT IS. THANK YOU MISTER

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:36.751
CHAIRMAN OF SENATOR- IS YOU

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:37.886
KNOW I'M VICE CHAIR OF ASSEMBLY

01:22:37.952 --> 01:22:40.689
BUDGET AND I SAID- JAIL B. C.

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.891
AS WELL SO I TEND TO SEE POLICY

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:44.626
THROUGH BUDGETARY LANDS YEAH

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.328
AND MY FIRST THOUGHTS WHEN I

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:48.263
READ YOUR BILL WAS- INTERESTING

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:50.231
IDEA I WONDER WHAT THAT WILL

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.766
COST AND HOW WILL PAY FOR IT.

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:54.002
SO ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT IT

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:55.737
WOULD COST IS NOT A SIMPLE TASK

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.205
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY COMPLEX

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:58.807
ISSUE TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:01.242
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF ATTENDANCE

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:02.277
IN THE STATE WOULD TAKE

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:03.378
ADVANTAGE OF THIS YOU HAVE TO

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:05.013
FIGURE OUT- BECAUSE THEIR TAX

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.214
CREDIT YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:07.248
WHAT THE TAX SITUATION OF THE

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:09.751
LANDLORDS IS AND HOW MUCH FOR

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:10.352
BROWN REVENUE THE STATE WITH

01:23:10.418 --> 01:23:11.686
THAT EXPERIENCE. AND THEN YOU

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:12.954
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY-

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:14.522
TEST LANDLORDS WOULD REQUEST

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:17.359
REFUNDABLE- REFUNDS OF THE TAX

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:18.293
CREDIT AND WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.427
LEGISLATURE WOULD APPROPRIATE

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:20.395
MONEY FOR HAT SINCE THAT'S A

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:21.563
SEPARATE PORTION OF THE BILL

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:23.398
SO- YOU KNOW IT'S A COMPLEX

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:25.400
ISSUE BUT CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:27.001
IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT EVERYONE

01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:28.236
AGREES THAT THE COST OF THIS

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:30.305
WOULD BE AT LEAST TWELVE

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:31.973
BILLION DOLLARS AND POTENTIALLY

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.310
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN THAT

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:35.910
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT. I

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:37.011
WOULD AGREE AND PART OF THE

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:39.247
CHALLENGE AND- HIS GETS TO THE

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:40.782
ISSUE THAT WAS THAT WAS JUST.

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:43.184
RAISED BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:45.653
GONZALEZ IS THAT- THERE.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.956
ORIGINALLY THIS BILL BASICALLY

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:49.290
SAYS THE STATE IS GOING TO PONY

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:50.725
UP THE MONEY. THAT THAT WAS THE

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:52.861
ORIGINAL BILL WAS WAS TO SAY WE

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:53.395
GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THE

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:55.196
SITUATION GOT TO DO IT NOW. THE

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:56.131
PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT WE

01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:57.432
DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. WE DON'T

01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:59.367
HAVE IT NOW AND WE LOOK DOWN

01:23:59.434 --> 01:24:00.502
THE ROAD WEHOPE THAT THE

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:03.338
ECONOMY STARTS TO PICK UP. AND

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:04.839
SO THE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:06.808
WE BEEN. BATTING AROUND IN

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.510
TERMS OR TO A BAR DISCUSSION OF

01:24:08.576 --> 01:24:10.979
HOW. HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHO

01:24:11.045 --> 01:24:15.683
REALLY NEEDS. THE RELIEF. AND

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:19.354
IF YOU'RE RENTING. A FIVE

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:21.589
THOUSAND DOLLAR A MONTH. CONDO

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:22.791
DO YOU EED THE RELIEF BECAUSE

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:24.058
YOU PROBABLY HAVE MONEY

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:25.193
SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU MAY NOT BE

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.694
MAKING IT TODAY BUT YOU'VE GOT

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:27.729
SOME KIND OF ASSETS AND

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:30.131
RESOURCES. BUT MAYBE THAT SEVEN

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:31.633
MAYBE SO THE NUMBER THE NUMBERS

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:33.234
BECOME REALLY IMPORTANT AND I.

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:35.937
I EXPECT I'M- I'M AN OPTIMIST

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:38.506
BUT I. IN TERMS OF WHEN I LOOK

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:41.609
AT NUMBERS. I AM VERY A REALIST

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:43.178
AND I DON'T THINK YOUR NUMBER

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:45.647
IS VERY FAR OFF IT PUT COULD

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:47.482
POTENTIALLY COST IS THAT DOWN

01:24:47.549 --> 01:24:49.250
THE ROAD. AND A LOT OF THINGS.

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:51.986
IT DEPENDS ON HOW LONG WE LEAVE

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:53.822
THE WINDOW OPEN THE DATE IS

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:55.490
BLANK RIGHT NW. BECAUSE WE

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:59.761
WANT TO HAVE THE BEST. MEDICAL

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:02.163
INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN WE THINK

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:03.798
THAT PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO GO

01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:07.469
BACK TO WORK. ON OR THE ECONOMY

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:08.937
TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT. AND

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:09.904
HELP WHETHER WE SET UP A MEANS

01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:13.775
TEST. AND WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:15.777
BECAUSE THE NUMBERS. THE

01:25:15.844 --> 01:25:17.111
NUMBERS ARE FLUCTUATING IT'S

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:18.546
NOT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:19.848
DOWNWARD TREND AND IT'S GOING

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:21.616
TO AND IT'LL BE IT WILL BE AT

01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:23.418
UPSIDE DOWN IT WON'T BE A YOU

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:25.119
IN OTHER WORDS. IT'S PROBABLY

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:26.721
GOING TO BE IN FITS AND STARTS

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.957
AND SO OUR NUMBERS ARE ARE- I

01:25:29.023 --> 01:25:29.858
THINK THE HIGHEST NUMBER I'VE

01:25:29.924 --> 01:25:31.726
SEEN IS TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.061
I'M HOPING IT'S LESS THAN THAT

01:25:33.127 --> 01:25:34.662
BUT WE GOT TO BE PREPARED FOR

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:37.665
IT BEING SENT TO SUBSTANTIAL.

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:39.434
OKAY YEAH IT'S- I KNOW I'M NOT

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:41.202
SAYING ANYTHING THAT YOU

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:41.836
HAVEN'T ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT.

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:43.538
BUT OBVIOUSLY TWELVE BILLION

01:25:43.605 --> 01:25:45.073
DOLLARS IS THE SUBSTANTIAL

01:25:45.139 --> 01:25:47.308
PORTION OF GENERAL FUND

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:48.443
SPENDING VERY MUCH DOWN TO. AT

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:51.045
LEAST FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND

01:25:51.112 --> 01:25:53.615
NEXT FISCAL YEAR OUR BUDGET IS

01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:55.350
YOU KNOW BALANCED IF YOU CAN

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:58.253
CALL A BALANCED. THROUGH USING

01:25:58.319 --> 01:26:00.054
THE TOOLS OF SPENDING DEFERRALS

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:02.323
AND BORROWING SO IT'S NOT AS IF

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:04.626
AND WHEN RESERVES. YES USE ME

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:05.593
FOR INTERRUPTING CERTAINLY

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.662
AARON RESERVES BUT BUT MY POINT

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.964
IS THAT AS WE HOPEFULLY EMERGE

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:11.599
FROM THIS RECESSION WHICH YOU

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.001
KNOW PROBABLY FROM AN

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.135
EMPLOYMENT STANDPOINT IS NOT

01:26:14.202 --> 01:26:15.403
GOING TO BE NEXT YEAR BUT

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:16.771
HOPEFULLY THE YEAR AFTER THAT.

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.006
WELL WE ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:20.108
SEVERAL YEARS OF VERY DIFFICULT

01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:21.676
BUDGETARY SITUATIONS IN THE

01:26:21.743 --> 01:26:23.511
STATE BECAUSE OF THE DEFERRALS

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:24.512
IN THE BORROWING THAT WE'RE

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:26.447
USING TO BALANCE THE BUDGET NOW

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:28.917
AND MEET THIS NEED SO- I

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:29.851
THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:31.352
GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND HIS PRESS

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:33.021
CONFERENCE THIS WEEK. TALKED

01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:36.157
ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE STATE

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:38.459
TO USE STATE FUNDING TO PAY

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:40.662
LEAVE- THE STATE'S PORTION OF

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:43.031
THE- THE FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:44.799
INSURANCE SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:45.767
THAT'S BEEN AS YOU KNOW A BIG

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.035
DEBATE IN CONGRESS OUT OF STONE

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:48.436
THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:49.971
MADE AN OFFER THIS LAST

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:51.205
WEEKEND- THROUGH AN EXECUTIVE

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:54.375
ORDER OF- THREE TO ONE MATCH

01:26:54.442 --> 01:26:55.877
FOR STATE FUNDING SO OUR AT THE

01:26:55.944 --> 01:26:57.011
STATE PUTS HIM HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:58.446
A WEEK AND FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE

01:26:58.513 --> 01:26:59.847
IN THREE HUNDRED. AND GOVERNU

01:26:59.914 --> 01:27:00.949
SOME SAID FLAT OUT THE STATE

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:02.517
ABSOLUTELY CAN'T AFFORD THAT

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:04.719
BUT INTERESTINGLY THE COST OF

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:06.321
THAT IS ACTUALLY FAR LESS THAN

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:07.121
THE COST OF WHAT YOU ARE

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:09.157
PROPOSING TO DO. SO I THINK

01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:10.658
IT'S YOU BE IRRESPONSIBLE FOR

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:15.930
US TO TALK ABOUT THE MERITS. OF

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:16.531
THIS POLICY. WITHOUT AT THE

01:27:16.598 --> 01:27:17.065
SAME TIME TALK ABOUT WE'RE

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:18.733
GOING TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE OF

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.334
AN ISSUE NO WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.935
OPTION OF OUR OWN WITH THAT

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:21.436
MONEY HAS TO COME FROM

01:27:21.502 --> 01:27:23.071
SOMEWHERE. MY GRANDMOTHER

01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:24.372
BEFORE SHE PASSED USED TO TELL

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:26.140
ME THAT IF WISHES WERE FISHES

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:28.676
WE DAHLE CASTANETS. AND SO YOU

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:29.978
KNOW IT FORTUNATELY WISHES ARE

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:31.245
FISHES AND SO WE'RE GOING TO

01:27:31.312 --> 01:27:32.847
PASS A POLICY LIKE THIS WITH A

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:33.781
SUBSTANTIAL COST I THINK I

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:35.216
THINK WE NEED TO TALK. AT THE

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:36.317
SAME TIME ABOUT WHERE THAT

01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:37.318
MONEY COMES FROM THAT'S MY BIG

01:27:37.385 --> 01:27:40.388
CONCERN. WITH THIS BILL RIGHT

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:40.955
NOW IS THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING

01:27:41.022 --> 01:27:43.992
THAT DISCUSSION. INSTEAD. THANK

01:27:44.058 --> 01:27:48.563
YOU THIS ISSUE GREAT THANK YOU

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.231
MR CHAIRMAN AB LET ME FIRST

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:52.066
START BY JUST REALLY THINKING

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:54.302

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:59.107
AND- AND IF I COULD BE CLEAR TO

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:01.943
THE PUBLIC WE HAVE AS AS THOSE

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:02.577
OF US WERE AUTHORED BILLS IN

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:04.646
THE SPACE. VERY VERY LITTLE

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:06.014
TIME TO ADDRESS THIS THIS

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.449
CRISIS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAD

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:09.183
INITIALLY BEEN LOOKING AT A

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:11.119
DEADLINE OF THIS FRIDAY TO LIFT

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:12.186
THEIR STATEWIDE TEMPERATURE

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:14.255
MORATORIUM- THAT IS HOPEFULLY

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:15.623
GOING TO BE MOVED TO SEPTEMBER

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:18.092
FIRST BUT AT BEST WE HAVE. TWO

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.460
AND A HALF WEEKS TO FIGURE OUT

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:22.664
HOW TO AVERT A MASSIVE WAVE OF

01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:24.432
EVICTIONS WHICH WOULD BE

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:25.700
INCREDIBLY CATASTROPHIC FOR

01:28:25.767 --> 01:28:27.101
TENANTS HOMELESSNESS AND

01:28:27.168 --> 01:28:29.003
COVERED SPREAD- OF THE

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:30.171
MAGNITUDE I THINK IT'S HARD FOR

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:31.773
ANY OF US TO COMPREHEND SO I

01:28:31.839 --> 01:28:33.307

THINKING. INTO THIS BILL THIS

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:40.314
IS HARD THIS IS REALLY HARD

01:28:40.381 --> 01:28:42.116
AND- I THINK ONE IMPORTANT

01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:44.185
ELEMENT FROM YOUR BILL THAT I

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:45.753
APPRECIATE IS THE IDEA THAT IF

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:48.156
THE FEDS ARE NOT GOING TO COME

01:28:48.222 --> 01:28:49.223
TO THE RESCUE OF AMERICANS THAT

01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:50.224
THE STATE OUGHT TO PUT MONEY

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:51.893
INTO THIS CRISIS I SUPPORT THAT

01:28:51.959 --> 01:28:54.629
PREMISE ALL I WILL SAY THAT IF

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:55.530

PROBLEM I WOULD PROBABLY

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:59.934
SUGGEST. I WOULD I WOULD

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.169
PROPOSE DOING IT THROUGH DIRECT

01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:04.639
RENTAL SUBSIDIES RATHER THAN

01:29:04.706 --> 01:29:06.074
THROUGH TAX BREAKS TO THE

CLOSE. AND NOT PERSONALLY.

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:31.899
STRONGLY FEEL THAT THIS. THESE

01:29:31.966 --> 01:29:34.135

THIS BILL. I'VE BEEN ON THIS

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:43.211
BILL FROM ITS INCEPTION AND-

01:29:43.277 --> 01:29:44.812
JUST TO SUMMARIZE A FEW THE

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:46.314
CHALLENGES THAT BUT I THINK WE

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.317
HAVE SEEN- WE HEARD FROM OUR-

01:29:49.383 --> 01:29:50.518
BUDGET VICE CHAIR THE PRICE

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:52.086
TAG. TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS AND

01:29:52.153 --> 01:29:54.555
COUNTING- AND THE FACT THAT- IT

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:55.723
IT MAY NOT IT MEET THE

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:58.259
IMMEDIATE CRISIS FOR MANY

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.927
INDIVIDUALS. YOU ARE WELL AWARE

01:29:59.994 --> 01:30:01.796

01:30:01.863 --> 01:30:04.699
MOM AND POP LANDLORDS- YOU'VE

01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:05.900
HEARD FROM OUR PREPARATIONS

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:07.268
CHAIR ABOUT THE CHALLENGES FOR

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:08.770
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES PARTICULARLY

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:11.706
ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT. AND

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:12.607
STRUGGLING UNDOCUMENTED

01:30:12.673 --> 01:30:14.742
COMMUNITY- REYES IN THE

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:16.878
ANALYSIS WERE THE CHALLENGES

01:30:16.944 --> 01:30:18.012
AND HOW THIS BILL WOULD

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:20.214
PREVENTIVE ACTIONS. CONDUCTED

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:21.816
BY OTHER MEANS- THE

01:30:21.883 --> 01:30:23.584
POSSIBILITIES OF A FRAUD

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:25.086
INVOLVING THIS NEW TAX CREDIT

01:30:25.153 --> 01:30:27.021
SYSTEM AND THEN. MANY QUESTIONS

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:28.489
ABOUT HOW THE TAX AUTHORITIES

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:29.624
WILL TREAT THESE CREDITS AND

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.325
WHAT THE- FUTURE TAX COURT

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:32.627
MARKET WOULD LOOK LIKE. WE

01:30:32.693 --> 01:30:33.427
COULD PROBABLY SPEND A LOT OF

01:30:33.494 --> 01:30:34.529
TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS BUT

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:36.197
WHAT I'D LOVE TO DO WE'VE

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:36.764
ALREADY STARTED SOME

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:38.132
CONVERSATIONS IS JUST

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:39.867
UNDERSTAND YOUR RESPONSE TO THE

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:40.802
ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED IN THE

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:42.770
ANALYSIS. I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY

01:30:42.837 --> 01:30:44.071
FOR ME. AND WE'VE HEARD THIS

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:45.973
FROM THE TECH COMMUNITY ALL

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.842
OVER THE STATE. THE CHALLENGE I

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:49.544
HAVE WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS IT

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:50.878
PUTS THE LANDLORD IN THE DRIVER

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:53.381
SEAT AND THERE ARE STILL. TOO

01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:55.483
MANY VOLUNTARY ASPECTS OF THIS

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:58.052
PROPOSAL THAT DON'T PROVIDE

01:30:58.119 --> 01:30:59.654
TENANTS. THE PROTECTIONS THAT

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:02.089
THAT I BELIEVE THEY NEED- I'VE

01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:02.990
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

01:31:03.057 --> 01:31:04.325
PERSPECTIVE OF THE LANDLORD

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:06.294
INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY- THE

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.529
LARGER LANDLORDS- PLAYERS BUT

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:10.431
WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT TENANTS.

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:13.301
HOMEOWNERS AND SMALLER PROPERTY

01:31:13.367 --> 01:31:13.935
OWNERS ARE GOING TO RECEIVE THE

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:15.336
PROTECTIONS THAT THEY NEED. IF

01:31:15.403 --> 01:31:16.771
THIS WERE THE ONLY BILL IN THE

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:18.239
WORKS I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.775
SUPPORT IT AS THE SOLE SOLUTION

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:22.176
TO BUILDING CRISIS AND WE HAVE.

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:23.477
BUT I DO THINK THAT THE

01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:25.279
APPROACH OF THIS BILL COULD BE

01:31:25.346 --> 01:31:26.981
AN IMPORTANT COMPLEMENT FOR

01:31:27.048 --> 01:31:29.250
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO- CENTER

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:32.086
I HAVE SPOKEN AND BOTH OF US-

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:33.487
HAVE HAD ALONG WITH OUR

01:31:33.554 --> 01:31:34.288
COLLISIONS ON GOING

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:35.923
CONVERSATIONS WITH LEADERSHIP

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:37.458
AND WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:40.094
AND IF IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT-

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.796
TO GET CENTER AND I THINK IT IS

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:42.964
OUR RESPECTIVE HOPES AND

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:45.166
EXPECTATIONS THAT. THIS BILL

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:47.535
AND A. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:48.069
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:49.303
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:50.671
HOPEFULLY SHORTLY THERE WILL BE

01:31:50.738 --> 01:31:52.073
A LARGER AGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:53.107
TWO HOUSES AND THE GOVERNOR'S

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:55.743
OFFICE AND MY PROFOUND HOPE IS

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.378
THAT THESE BILLS WLL REFLECT A

01:31:57.445 --> 01:31:59.847
BALANCED. COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE

01:31:59.914 --> 01:32:01.649
TO PREVENT COVER TENET PROTECT

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:03.885
EVICTIONS AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS

01:32:03.951 --> 01:32:05.052
OF STRUGGLING PROPERTY OWNERS

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:06.754
AND LANDLORS SO- WITH THAT I

01:32:06.821 --> 01:32:08.656
DO PLAN TO SUPPORT TODAY-

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:10.258
OBVIOUSLY YOU YOU AND I HAVE A

01:32:10.324 --> 01:32:10.858
LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THE NEXT

01:32:10.925 --> 01:32:12.760
COUPLE WEEKS BUT- LOOKING FOR

01:32:12.827 --> 01:32:14.195
THOSE LATE NIGHTS AND WE HAVE

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:16.530
TO GET THIS DONE SO. SO THANK

01:32:16.597 --> 01:32:18.633

APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS- TRYING

01:32:23.871 --> 01:32:24.906
TO COME UP WITH A CREATIVE

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:26.674
SOLUTION- TO AN IMPORTANT

01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:29.343
ISSUE- BUT I THINK THE

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:30.678
DISSOLUTION THERE'S SOME BIG

01:32:30.745 --> 01:32:33.447
PROBLEMS- NUMBER ONE I YOU KNOW

01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:35.683
THE EVICTION SUSPENSION IS VERY

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:37.451
BROAD AN INDEFINITE AT THIS

01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:38.352
POINT LIKE AT LEAST WITH

01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:40.154
JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE HAVE A

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:42.089
CLEAR TIMELINE FOR WHEN THIS

01:32:42.156 --> 01:32:43.457
EVICTION SUSPENSION IS GOING TO

01:32:43.524 --> 01:32:46.494
BE IN PLACE- WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.828
IN THIS BILL IT'S IT HASN'T

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:50.197
BEEN DEFINED- WE ALSO IS VERY

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:51.832
BROAD I MEAN WHAT ABOUT TENANTS

01:32:51.899 --> 01:32:53.634
WHO MAYBE YOU'RE IN A SITUATION

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:55.670
WHERE. A NEIGHBORING TENANT IS

01:32:55.736 --> 01:32:58.372
A NUISANCE WE'RE NEED TO WEAR A

01:32:58.439 --> 01:32:59.907
OR A LANDLORD WE HAVE SOMEONE

01:32:59.974 --> 01:33:01.375
WHO'S IN A SUBSTANTIAL BREACH

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:02.810
OF THE LEAST FOR SOME OTHER

01:33:02.877 --> 01:33:04.612
REASON OTHER THAN RENT I MEAN

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:06.280
IT'S CAUSING A PROBLEM FOR THE

01:33:06.347 --> 01:33:08.349
COMPLEX AS A WHOLE. THERE WOULD

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:11.085
BE NO NO WAY TO GO FOR WITH AN

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:13.220
ELECTION YOU KNOW AND SO THAT'S

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:16.457
NOT ADDRESS IN HERE SO I THINK

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:17.224
THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM. ALSO WE

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:19.026
GO TO AND WE HEARD IT VERY

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:20.861
CLEARLY SMALL MOM AND POPS.

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:22.763
LANDLORDS HOW IN THE WORLD IS

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:24.432
OF A TAX CREDIT FOR YEARS FROM

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:26.801
NOW. GOING TO HELP THEM PAY

01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:28.669
THEIR MORTGAGE TODAY. ANOTHER

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:29.737
THING I THINK IS OFTEN

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:31.339
FORGOTTEN IS A LOT OF THESE

01:33:31.405 --> 01:33:33.074
FOLKS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:34.942
TENNIS RIGHT NOW. AND ARE

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:35.843
WORKING THROUGH THIS BECAUSE

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.311
NOBODY WANTS TO A BIG SOMEONE

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:38.646
NO WANT TO BE PUT IN THAT IN

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:40.414
THAT SITUATION ANOTHER THE

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:43.184
TENANT OR THE LANDLORD- AND SO

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:44.085
THEY'RE ALREADY WORKING WITH

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:45.353
PEOPLE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:47.221
MORTGAGES. THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:48.923
PAY TODAY AND I'LL TELL YOU

01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:49.423
WHO'S NOT GOING TO WAIT

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:52.493
INDEFINITELY- BEFORE FOR

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.528
CLOSING AND THAT'S THE BANKS

01:33:54.595 --> 01:33:56.364
AND SOME OF ALL ENTIRELY AGREED

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.699
TO DO DEFERMENTS. BUT THERE'S

01:33:58.766 --> 01:34:00.701
NO MANDATE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

01:34:00.768 --> 01:34:01.535
NOR DO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD

01:34:01.602 --> 01:34:03.270
BE GOOD POLICY. TO DO THAT IN

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:04.472
THE FIRST PLACE BUT YOU'RE

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:06.374
PUTTING THE SMALL MOM AND POPS.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.010
IN A VERY BAD PLACE SO. I JUST

01:34:09.076 --> 01:34:09.610
FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOME REALLY

01:34:09.677 --> 01:34:13.781
BIG HOLES. IN THE SOLUTION BUT

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:14.982
THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS I THINK

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:16.550
THIS IS KIND OF AVOIDING. THE

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:19.253
GREATER QUESTION. WHICH IS WHY

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.755
ARE PEOPLE NOT ABLE TO PAY RENT

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:22.757
RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE BIG

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:23.290
REASONS IS BECAUSE WE TOOK

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:26.027
THEIR JOBS AWAY. AND YOU MIGHT

01:34:26.093 --> 01:34:27.361
SAY WELL HEY THAT WAS DOLLARS

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:30.331
FOR SAFETY PURPOSES. GOOD OKAY.

01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:32.033
BUT THEN WE FAILED TO PAY THEIR

01:34:32.099 --> 01:34:33.901
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. AND WE

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:35.736
HAVE AN EIGHTY DISS FAILED TO

01:34:35.803 --> 01:34:37.004
DO ITS JOB AND MAKE SURE THE

01:34:37.071 --> 01:34:38.472
PEOPLE HAVE THE BENEFITS THAT

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:39.640
THEY NEED THAT MAYBE WHAT LET

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:41.509
THEM. PAY RENT THAT'S ONE OF

01:34:41.575 --> 01:34:43.310
THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS OF WHY

01:34:43.377 --> 01:34:45.546
WE'RE HAVING THIS SITUATION.

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:47.915
AND YES MANY OF US HAVE TALKED

01:34:47.982 --> 01:34:48.449
ABOUT THIS BUT THE PROBLEM

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:50.351
HASN'T BEEN FIXED YET. YOU

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:52.386
KNOW. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS HIGH

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:54.321
COST OF LIVING RIGHT KILEY HIGH

01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:56.290
COST OF RENTS AND HOUSING WE

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:58.325
COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

01:34:58.392 --> 01:34:59.760
BY PASSING LEGISLATION WHICH

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:00.628
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR

01:35:00.694 --> 01:35:04.432
YEARS TO REFORM SEQUEL. MISTER

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:05.332
YOU'RE GETTING A RATHER BIT OFF

01:35:05.399 --> 01:35:07.835
TOPIC I WAS VERY MUCH ON TOP OF

01:35:07.902 --> 01:35:09.637
MR CHAIRMAN THAT'S EXPOSITORY

01:35:09.703 --> 01:35:11.372
AND IT'S NOT THESE ARE NOT

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:12.440
ISSUES BEING ADDRESSED BY THIS

01:35:12.506 --> 01:35:14.475
BILL. THOSE ARE POLICIES THAT

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:16.577
YOU'RE WELCOME TO. INTRODUCE

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:18.345
YOUR OWN BILLS AND EXPOSE

01:35:18.412 --> 01:35:20.314
DISCUSS SO THAT YOU WANT BY THE

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:22.316
DENTIST AND THEY'RE RELEVANT TO

01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:24.185
THIS TOPIC AND I'M A MEMBER OF

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:25.352
THIS LEGISLATURE AND I WILL

01:35:25.419 --> 01:35:27.221
GIVE THE REASONS FOR WHY. I

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:29.857
SUPPORTER DON'T SUPPORT THIS

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:30.424
POLICY IN THIS BILL THAT IS

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:31.959
BEFORE US. AND WHAT I'M SAYING

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:32.960
IS IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:35.696
UNDERLYING PROBLEM OF A LACK OF

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:37.698
HOUSING WE'VE LIMITED OUR

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:38.632
HOUSING WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT

01:35:38.699 --> 01:35:40.201
KEEPING UP AND THAT'S WHY RENTS

01:35:40.267 --> 01:35:42.103
ARE SO HIGH. THAT'S WHY COST OF

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:43.938
HOUSING IS SO HIGH BECAUSE THIS

01:35:44.004 --> 01:35:45.372
LEGISLATORS REFUSED TO DO

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:47.341
ANYTHING ABOUT IT. WE'VE ALSO

01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:48.976
ADDED TO THE HIGH COST OF

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:49.543
LIVING AND I KNOW THE GOOD

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:51.579
SENATOR. HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS

01:35:51.645 --> 01:35:53.414
IN HER DISTRICT BECAUSE THE

01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:55.116
POLICIES THAT WE PASS. THROUGH

01:35:55.182 --> 01:35:56.517
THIS LEGISLATURE ARE WHAT IS

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:57.952
DRIVING UP THE COST OF

01:35:58.018 --> 01:36:00.454
ELECTRICITY FOR EXAMPLE. IN HIS

01:36:00.521 --> 01:36:01.956
WAS DRIVING UP THE COST OF GAS

01:36:02.022 --> 01:36:04.125
TO GET. TO A JOB YOU DON'T HAVE

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:07.828
ANYMORE UNFORTUNATELY- SO. ALL

01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:09.630
THESE THINGS WE KIND OF AVOID

01:36:09.697 --> 01:36:10.965
TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:11.932
WOULD MEAN THAT THE MAJORITY

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:14.201
PARTY WOULD HAVE TO OWN UP. TO

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:15.569
THE POLICY MISTAKES THAT THEY

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:17.271
HAVE MADE. THAT HAVE LED TO

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:19.406
THIS ISSUE. YOU KNOW INSTEAD WE

01:36:19.473 --> 01:36:20.741
WANT TO PASS THE BUCK AWESOME

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:22.676
UP SOMEHOW AND LANDLORDS

01:36:22.743 --> 01:36:24.712
THEY'RE STRUGGLING JUST AS MUCH

01:36:24.778 --> 01:36:26.413
AS EVERYBODY ELSE. DURING THIS

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.416
PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW AND SO TO ME

01:36:29.483 --> 01:36:30.551
I JUST THINK THAT WE'RE MISSING

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:31.785
THE BIGGER POINT HERE WE'RE

01:36:31.852 --> 01:36:32.686
MISSING THE BIG THE LARGER

01:36:32.753 --> 01:36:34.522
POINT IS A CALIFORNIA. HAS

01:36:34.588 --> 01:36:35.890
CREATED A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:37.358
PEOPLE WITH BAD POLICIES AND

01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:40.961
BAD GOVERNMENT. AND SO THAT'S

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:42.663
WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TODAY.

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:44.365
AND I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD BE

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:45.566
FOCUSING ON THOSE THINGS I JUST

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:47.334
TALKED ABOUT LET'S HONE IN ON

01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:48.102
THOSE THINGS AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:49.303
THOSE ARE CORRECTED. AND

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:50.404
THEY'LL DO A WHOLE LOT MORE TO

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:52.473
HELP TENANTS AND EVERYBODY. IN

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:53.641
THE STATE AS ARE MOVING THROUGH

01:36:53.707 --> 01:36:55.943
THIS VERY TOUGH- AND TUMULTUOUS

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:59.446
TIMES THANK YOU. IS THE MOST.

01:36:59.513 --> 01:37:01.415
THANK YOU. SO FIRST I ACTUALLY

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:03.417
WANT TO THINK AND THE AUTHOR IN

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:06.320
AUTHORS- FOR BRINGING THIS TO

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:06.987
OUR ATTENTION THIS IS A

01:37:07.054 --> 01:37:09.456
CRITICAL CONVERSATION- IN OUR

01:37:09.523 --> 01:37:11.125
STATE AND WE DO HAVE A LOOMING

01:37:11.192 --> 01:37:13.260
EVICTION CRISIS IN OUR STATE. I

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:14.795
CERTAINLY WE CAN SPEND A LOT OF

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:17.164
TIME LOOKING AT ROOT CAUSES-

01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:18.399
BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:20.301
SITUATION THAT IS IN FRONT OF

01:37:20.367 --> 01:37:22.169
US- AND I THINK IT'S A- VERY

01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:24.371
THE HOUSING CRISIS NO DOUBT. IS

01:37:24.438 --> 01:37:25.940
AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES

01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:27.174
THAT WE WERE ADDRESSING PRIOR

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:28.776
TO COBIT. AND CERTAINLY DURING

01:37:28.842 --> 01:37:31.178
THE WHOLE OF IT- I THINK THAT.

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:32.313
MOST OF US AGREE THAT THE

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:36.083
PROBLEM- THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT

01:37:36.150 --> 01:37:36.650
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE

01:37:36.717 --> 01:37:38.586
LEGISLATURE. AT AND I A THINK

01:37:38.652 --> 01:37:40.521
THAT THAT'S- A DIFFICULT

01:37:40.588 --> 01:37:41.455
CONVERSATION YOU'VE BEEN

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:44.091
ENGAGED IN LEADING- A DIFFICULT

01:37:44.158 --> 01:37:46.026
CONVERSATION BUT THEY- THEY

01:37:46.093 --> 01:37:47.661
NEED TO HAPPEN- FOR THE PEOPLE

01:37:47.728 --> 01:37:49.597
OF CALIFORNIA. AND I KNOW THAT

01:37:49.663 --> 01:37:51.131
TO THIS IS ONE OF A YOU KNOW

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:52.633
DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT ARE

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.468
THAT ARE THAT. ARE PART IN

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:55.402
DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS AT THIS

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:56.904
PARTICULAR MOMENT. I THINK I

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:58.239
WANT TO ECHO JUST A COUPLE

01:37:58.305 --> 01:37:59.607
THINGS THAT SOME OF MY

01:37:59.673 --> 01:38:01.609
COLLEAGUES- HAVE ECHOED. WHICH

01:38:01.675 --> 01:38:03.444
IS AT FIRST THE ISSUE RELATED

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.379
TO- ELIGIBILITY FOR

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:07.681
UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS- I

01:38:07.748 --> 01:38:09.717
THINK THAT YOU KNOW AS A MEMBER

01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:10.784
OF THE LATINO CAUCUS WE'VE

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:12.786
TALKED SO MUCH AT LENGTH ABOUT

01:38:12.853 --> 01:38:14.188
THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON

01:38:14.255 --> 01:38:15.856
KOBE IT. NOT JUST ON THE HEALTH

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:17.224
SIDE ON THE EDUCATION SIDE ON

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.892
THE HOUSING SIDE. ON EVERY

01:38:18.959 --> 01:38:21.262
SIDE- AND- I THINK IT'S

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:23.130
SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES. TO BE

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:24.798
AN ISSUE FOR ME AND I THINK

01:38:24.865 --> 01:38:25.766
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:28.369
RECOGNIZE THAT. WE HAVE TO TRY

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:30.771
TO FIND A WAY. TO HELP ALL

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:32.139
MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND

01:38:32.206 --> 01:38:33.874
PERHAPS THIS IS A PART OF A

01:38:33.941 --> 01:38:36.644
BIGGER SOLUTION RIGHT- THAT. IN

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:38.145
TERMS OF WHERE WE END UP ON ON

01:38:38.212 --> 01:38:40.080
THE HOUSING ISSUE- BUT

01:38:40.147 --> 01:38:43.083
CERTAINLY. AG IT MAKES ME AT

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:44.485
YOUKNOW CRINGE TO THINK THAT

01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:45.919
WE COULD LEAVE ANYONE WHO CAN'T

01:38:45.986 --> 01:38:47.288
PROVIDE AND I TENER SOCIAL

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:49.156
SECURITY OUT. OF A SOLUTION

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:50.791
WHEN THEY ARE ARE ESSENTIAL

01:38:50.858 --> 01:38:52.660
WORKERS WHERE THEY ARE. THE

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:54.962
PEOPLE THAT WE NEED. TO BE ON

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:56.563
THE FRONT LINES BUT WE CAN'T

01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:58.465
FIND A WAY TO PROTECT THEM SO.

01:38:58.532 --> 01:39:02.903
I IN YOU ARE DEVOTED RESTING.

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:04.538
THINKING ABOUT IT. I'M AT THE

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:05.139
THAT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THE

01:39:05.205 --> 01:39:06.607
CONCERN THAT THAT I HAVE. AND

01:39:06.674 --> 01:39:08.776
THE OTHER IS RELATED TO. THE

01:39:08.842 --> 01:39:10.311
ADMINISTRATION OF TAX CREDIT

01:39:10.377 --> 01:39:12.246
SYSTEM. I THINK THE ANALYSIS

01:39:12.313 --> 01:39:13.580
FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD

01:39:13.647 --> 01:39:14.948
RAISE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS

01:39:15.015 --> 01:39:16.850
ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. AND

01:39:16.917 --> 01:39:19.420
WHETHER OR NOT- THERE WOULD BE

01:39:19.486 --> 01:39:21.555
A LOT OF. WHETHER OR NOT THIS

01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:23.223
CAN ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED. I

01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:25.693
THINK THE SYSTEM- OF LANDLORDS

01:39:25.759 --> 01:39:28.729
AND GREEN TO THE F. T. B. AND

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:31.231
IF TO BE TRACKING TAX CREDITS-

01:39:31.298 --> 01:39:34.101
IS. IN RESOURCE INTENSIVE

01:39:34.168 --> 01:39:37.338
SYSTEM. AND CERTAINLY I EXPECT

01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:38.639
THAT THAT WOULD REQUIRE A

01:39:38.706 --> 01:39:40.774
SIGNIFICANT IT SYSTEM OVERHAUL

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:42.609
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AT

01:39:42.676 --> 01:39:46.413
TRACKING AND- YOU KNOW I'M

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.481
CONCERNED THAT. THE FRANCHISE

01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:49.016
TAX BOARD HAS ALREADY SAID THAT

01:39:49.083 --> 01:39:49.483
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:50.484
DIFFICULTIES THAT THEY'RE GOING

01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:52.619
TO IT DOES IT DOES CONCERNS.

01:39:52.686 --> 01:39:54.088
AND WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN DO

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:55.856
THIS RIGHT AT THIS PARTICULAR

01:39:55.923 --> 01:39:57.491
TIME CREATE BUT I KNOW AGAIN

01:39:57.558 --> 01:39:59.360
THAT THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED-

01:39:59.426 --> 01:40:01.929
AND EVEN I THINK. AS WE LOOK AT

01:40:01.995 --> 01:40:04.965
THESE TWO ISSUES- JUST YOU KNOW

01:40:05.032 --> 01:40:08.535
THE OVERALL. ISSUES OF WHETHER

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:10.704
OR NOT WE WILL HAVE AT

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:12.406
LANDLORDS- WORK WITH THEIR

01:40:12.473 --> 01:40:14.808
TENANTS IN GOOD FAITH OR WILL

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:17.044
YOU KNOW THIS RESORT TO SOME

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:18.912
OTHER TYPES OF TACTICS THAT CAN

01:40:18.979 --> 01:40:21.715
SCARE. TENANTS FROM MOVING OUT-

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:24.885
I KNOW THAT. THIS IS AGAIN ONE

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:26.553
APPROACH I WANT TO JUST

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:27.721
HIGHLIGHT THAT ACCORDING TO OUR

01:40:27.788 --> 01:40:30.424
LAST CENSUS 55% OF CALIFORNIANS

01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:30.958
LIVED IN A HOME THAT THE

01:40:31.024 --> 01:40:34.628
ACTUALLY OWNED- AND- THAT IS A

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:36.430
DIFFERENT TYPE OF STREAM. AND

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:38.232
THIS PARTICULAR SOLUTION

01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:39.833
DOESN'T SOLVE FOR THAT BUT I DO

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.702
HOPE THAT THE CONVERSATIONS AT

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:43.437
THE STATEWIDE LEVEL ALSO

01:40:43.504 --> 01:40:45.372
ACCOUNT FOR THE 55% OF

01:40:45.439 --> 01:40:47.474
CALIFORNIANS. THAT ARE NOT

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:49.309
RENTING- BUT THAT LIVE IN A

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:50.677
HOME AND I THINK IT'S BEEN

01:40:50.744 --> 01:40:53.180
ALLUDED TO- YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD

01:40:53.247 --> 01:40:54.715
BE THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN

TERMS OF MORTGAGES. AND WHAT

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:58.786
KINDS OF ROLES AND THAT'S NOT

01:40:58.852 --> 01:41:00.621
THIS PARTICULAR BILL BUT IT IS

01:41:00.687 --> 01:41:01.722
PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE

01:41:01.789 --> 01:41:03.390
SOLUTION SO I THINK MY

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:07.394
COMMENTS- ARE. ARE DEFINITELY

01:41:07.461 --> 01:41:11.098
OF. RECOGNIZING THIS IS ONE

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:12.666
PART OF THE SOLUTION IT'S A

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:15.335
DIFFICULT ONE I. BELIEVE WE

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:18.338
THINK THIS. IS A SECONDING YOU

01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:24.645
HAPPEN. I'M NOT BILL. BUT I

01:41:24.711 --> 01:41:25.345
THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH SOME

01:41:25.412 --> 01:41:25.913
OF THE THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED

01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:26.513
BY COLLEAGUES WE WILL TO GET

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:27.347

THE BILL THIS IS SUCH A SERIOUS

01:41:44.798 --> 01:41:47.267
SERIOUS ISSUE AND I THINK WHAT

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:48.469
I APPRECIATE THE MOST IS THE

01:41:48.535 --> 01:41:49.336
FACT THAT WE HAVE THE

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:51.004
ADMINISTRATION THE SUMMIT IN

01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:53.173
THE ASSEMBLY. ABSOLUTELY

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.641
WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE

01:41:54.708 --> 01:41:56.343
THAT WE FIND A SOLUTION WE

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:58.745
CANNOT LEAVE AT THE END OF

01:41:58.812 --> 01:42:00.514
SEPTEMBER OR THE END OF AUGUST

01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:02.549
WITHOUT HAVING FOUND A SOLUTION

01:42:02.616 --> 01:42:03.617
SO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SO

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:06.086
MANY ON BOTH IN BOTH HOUSES

01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:07.454
PLUS THE ADMINISTRATION WORKING

01:42:07.521 --> 01:42:10.224
TO FIND THE BEST SOLUTION MEET

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:12.192
NONE OF WHAT I HAVE READ IS THE

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:13.894
PERFECT SOLUTION NOT HERE NOT

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:16.163
IN ANY OTHER PROPOSAL. BUT I

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:17.364
THINK THAT THE FACT THAT SO

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:20.000
MANY PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON THIS

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:21.802
REMINDS US THAT THAT'S WHAT

01:42:21.869 --> 01:42:24.972
WE'RE HERE FOR. I APPRECIATE SO

01:42:25.038 --> 01:42:28.041
MUCH THAT. WE NEED A HOUSE IS

01:42:28.108 --> 01:42:30.744
JUST COMPLAINING IT'S SO EASY

01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:32.646
TO COMPLAIN AND TO COMPLAIN AT

01:42:32.713 --> 01:42:33.780
THE PONTIFICATE ABOUT THE

01:42:33.847 --> 01:42:36.383
ISSUES. IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:39.086
ACTUALLY SPEND THE TIME TO WORK

01:42:39.152 --> 01:42:41.088
ON THE SOLUTION. THAT'S WHAT

01:42:41.154 --> 01:42:42.456
YOU'RE DOING THAT'S WHAT THE

01:42:42.523 --> 01:42:44.591
ASSEMBLY IS DOING WITH THE AB

01:42:44.658 --> 01:42:47.261
FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX AS WELL. I

01:42:47.327 --> 01:42:49.329
WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT

01:42:49.396 --> 01:42:51.064
HAVE BEEN MADE AND I KNOW THAT

01:42:51.131 --> 01:42:53.433
YOU AS A MEMBER OF THE LATINO

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:54.001
CAUCUS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED

01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:57.571
THIS. WE HAVE GOT TO FIND A WAY

01:42:57.638 --> 01:42:58.872
TO MAKE SURE THAT AE

01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:02.175
UNDOCUMENTED. RESIDENTS IN THE

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:04.044
STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIND

01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:07.314
PROTECTION AS TENANTS AS WELL.

01:43:07.381 --> 01:43:09.416
WE PRAISE THEM AS HEROES

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:10.584
BECAUSE THERE ARE FRONT LINE

01:43:10.651 --> 01:43:13.787
WORKERS ESSENTIAL WORKERS WE DO

01:43:13.854 --> 01:43:15.422
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:16.723
UPLIFT THEM. BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:18.325
PUTTING THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE

01:43:18.392 --> 01:43:19.493
AND GET WHEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.228
SOLUTIONS TO SOMETHING THAT IS.

01:43:21.295 --> 01:43:23.630
MOVING THESE EVICTIONS THAT ARE

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:26.800
COMING OUR WAY WE'VE GOT TO

01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:27.301
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:29.102
INCLUDED. I APPRECIATE VERY

01:43:29.169 --> 01:43:33.640
MUCH THAT EVERY SOLUTION THAT-IS BEING LOOKED AT IS WHAT IS

01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:35.576
CONSIDERING PROTECTING THE

01:43:35.642 --> 01:43:37.277
TENANTS WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY

01:43:37.344 --> 01:43:38.779
HAVE TO OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING

01:43:38.845 --> 01:43:40.747
TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. WITH

01:43:40.814 --> 01:43:42.583
THE INCREASED HOMELESSNESS.

01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:44.351
THIS IS THE BEST WAY IS TO MAKE

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:45.586
SURE WE KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR

01:43:45.652 --> 01:43:48.689
HOMES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. BUT

01:43:48.755 --> 01:43:49.890
I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:51.558
NOT FORGETTING THE LANDLORDS.

01:43:51.625 --> 01:43:54.595
THE VIRUS THAT IS AFFECTING ALL

01:43:54.661 --> 01:43:58.031
OF US. SHOULD NOT BE THAT THE

01:43:58.098 --> 01:44:00.067
COST OF IT SHOULD NOT BE BORNE

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:01.902
BY LANDLORDS MANY OF WHOM HAVE

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:04.137
INVESTED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS TO

01:44:04.204 --> 01:44:06.373
PURCHASE THESE RENTALS- THEY

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.008
SHOULD NOT BE THE ONES THAT

01:44:08.075 --> 01:44:10.243
HAVE TO SUFFER THE MOST. THE

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.811
STATE NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF

01:44:10.877 --> 01:44:14.047
THEM. AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:15.349
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEING

01:44:15.415 --> 01:44:18.018
CONSIDERED IN IN ALL OF THESE

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:19.820
PROPOSALS IT HAS TO BE-

01:44:19.886 --> 01:44:21.521
LANDLORDS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE

01:44:21.588 --> 01:44:23.323
FOR ALL OF THE- FOR ALL ALL OF

01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:24.858
THE DEALS THAT ARE HAPPENING.

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:27.894
IN CALIFORNIA- SO AGAIN I JUST

WE'VE TAKEN COPIOUS NOTES ON

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:02.696
ALL OF THIS. THIS TICKET AND

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:06.166
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR COMMENTS-

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:08.268
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS REALLY THE

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:09.603
BEST WAY TO END IT IS THIS IS A

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.238
REALLY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND

01:45:11.304 --> 01:45:13.306
PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS THAT

01:45:13.373 --> 01:45:13.974
YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:16.510
GOOD DATA- IN TERMS OF WHAT'S

01:45:16.576 --> 01:45:18.145
REALLY HAPPENING ON THE GROUND

01:45:18.211 --> 01:45:19.279
IN A LOT OF THE DATA COMES TO

01:45:19.346 --> 01:45:21.748
US FROM. NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

01:45:21.815 --> 01:45:26.887
BUT THE- THE INFORMATION SHOWS

01:45:26.953 --> 01:45:27.621
THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PAYING

01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:29.356
PART OF THE RENT IT'S NOT THAT

01:45:29.423 --> 01:45:31.091
THEY PAY THE RENT AT ALL IT'S

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:32.826
THAT THEY'RE MAKING PAYMENTS ON

01:45:32.893 --> 01:45:34.528
IT AND- AND WHAT WHAT'S

01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:36.229
COMPLICATED ABOUT THAT IS YOU

01:45:36.296 --> 01:45:38.065
DON'T WANT TO SET UP A SYSTEM

01:45:38.131 --> 01:45:39.399
WHERE PEOPLE CAN JUST WALK AWAY

01:45:39.466 --> 01:45:41.068
NOT TO PAY RENT ANYMORE IF YOU

01:45:41.134 --> 01:45:42.469
WANT THEM TO WORKING COOPERATE

01:45:42.536 --> 01:45:43.270
WITH THE LANDLORD BECAUSE

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:44.738
THAT'S HOW THE LANDLORD. IS

01:45:44.805 --> 01:45:46.406
MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS RIGHT THE

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:48.375
MORTGAGE PAYMENTS ESPECIALLY

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:50.377
THE MOM AND POP LANDLORDS AND

01:45:50.444 --> 01:45:53.447
THERE ARE MORE THAN WE REALIZE-

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:55.048
YEAH AND SO WHAT WHAT THE DATA

01:45:55.115 --> 01:45:58.618
SHOWS IN APRIL 24% OF THAT THE

01:45:58.685 --> 01:46:00.721
TENANTS. FAILED TO PAY ON TIME

01:46:00.787 --> 01:46:02.689
4% MADE NO PAYMENTS 212% MADE

01:46:02.756 --> 01:46:04.224
PARTIAL PAYMENTS AND THAT SO

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:07.661
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 30% 31%

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:12.699
THEY ENTER 1% IN JUNE AND-

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:13.500
WE'RE REALLY TRYING. AND WE TO

01:46:13.567 --> 01:46:15.869
REWARD THAT IT WE WANT TO MAKE

01:46:15.936 --> 01:46:16.436
SURE THAT WE'RE- DISTANCE.

01:46:16.503 --> 01:46:18.305
ICING THEM WORK TRYING TO WORK

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:18.872
THINGS OUT WITH THEIR WITH

01:46:18.939 --> 01:46:20.640
THEIR LANDLORDS SO. LET ME DO

01:46:20.707 --> 01:46:21.875
THAT LET ME JUST WRAP UP BY

01:46:21.942 --> 01:46:23.944
SAYING- THE GOVERNOR THE

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:24.911
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN VERY

01:46:24.978 --> 01:46:26.713
CLEAR THAT AN FTP SOLUTION IS

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:28.749
DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT. IT STARTS

01:46:28.815 --> 01:46:29.983
TO SET UP THIS BIG BUREAUCRACY

01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:32.452
AND IN REALITY. THE CHALLENGE

01:46:32.519 --> 01:46:35.322
BECOMES AS WE LOOK AT THIS

01:46:35.388 --> 01:46:38.091
ISSUE. IS WHO WHERE DOES THE

01:46:38.158 --> 01:46:40.527
MONEY COME FROM. READ BECAUSE

01:46:40.594 --> 01:46:41.995
OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT THE PURPOSE

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:44.765
OF THIS BILL IS TO KEEP TENANTS

01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:47.067
IN THEIR CURRENT RESIDENCES SO

01:46:47.134 --> 01:46:49.436
THAT THEY'RE NOT ON THE STREETS

01:46:49.503 --> 01:46:51.772
AND FOR NON PAYMENT OF RENT

01:46:51.838 --> 01:46:54.007
NUMBER TWO THAT TO HELP.

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:55.475
LANDLORDS MAKE THEIR MORTGAGE

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:56.877
PAYMENTS SO THAT WE DON'T END

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:59.246
UP WITH THE WHOLE RUSSIA OF

01:46:59.312 --> 01:47:00.814
MORTGAGE DEFAULTS BECAUSE THAT

01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:01.815
DOESN'T HELP US EITHER BECAUSE

01:47:01.882 --> 01:47:03.517
QUITE FRANKLY IT'S REALLY EASY

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:05.552
TO GET RID OF A TENANT IF THIS

01:47:05.619 --> 01:47:07.988
IF THE- THE UNIT HAS SOLD IT

01:47:08.054 --> 01:47:11.124
BECOMES A LOT EASIER- AS A

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:13.660
GENERAL RULE. AND SO WE WANT TO

01:47:13.727 --> 01:47:17.030
KEEP. LANDLORDS HOLE. AND WE

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:20.133
WANT TO PROTECT THE FISC OF THE

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:21.868
STATE WE DON'T WANT TO SET UP

01:47:21.935 --> 01:47:23.937
THIS HUGE LIABILITY SO THAT WE-

01:47:24.004 --> 01:47:26.039
WE THEN HAVE TO GO TURN AROUND

01:47:26.106 --> 01:47:27.641
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT. BUT WHAT

01:47:27.707 --> 01:47:29.509
RESOURCES WERE CUTTING FROM OUR

01:47:29.576 --> 01:47:30.377
STATE BUDGET BECAUSE WE'VE

01:47:30.443 --> 01:47:32.245
ASSUMED A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY

01:47:32.312 --> 01:47:33.647
SO THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON

01:47:33.713 --> 01:47:35.081
WITH WITH DOING A TAX CREDIT IS

01:47:35.148 --> 01:47:37.317
TO PUSH. SOME OF THE STATE

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:38.852
LIGHT BURKE THE STATE IN

01:47:38.919 --> 01:47:40.153
GAUGING IN THIS PROCESS

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:43.056
LIABILITY DOWN. DOWN THE ROAD

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:43.890
AND GIVE US A CHANCE TO RECOVER

01:47:43.957 --> 01:47:46.259
A LITTLE BIT SO. SO AS AS WE O

01:47:46.326 --> 01:47:47.427
THROUGH THIS WE WANT TO MAKE IT

01:47:47.494 --> 01:47:49.095
A SIMPLE PROCESS AND OBVIOUSLY

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:50.864
THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE PROCESS-

01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:51.832
BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE WAYS FOR

01:47:51.898 --> 01:47:53.667
US TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO WEEK

01:47:53.733 --> 01:47:56.570
BE ABLE TO CREATE A COMMITMENT.

01:47:56.636 --> 01:47:58.305
TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR IN THE

01:47:58.371 --> 01:48:00.006
RESIDENCE IS INSTALLED IT TOO I

01:48:00.073 --> 01:48:02.275
SYSTEM. TENANTS AS WELL I THINK

01:48:33.206 --> 01:48:34.875
WHERE THERE IS SO MUCH UNKNOWN

01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:35.642

THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS

01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:46.106
ABOUT. BUT SOME OF THOSE THINGS

01:50:46.172 --> 01:50:48.375

PREMISE OF THIS BILL A LOT BUT

02:30:59.550 --> 02:31:00.985
I FIND THE ARGUMENTS OF THE

02:31:01.051 --> 02:31:02.520
OPPOSITION- PRETTY PERSUASIVE

02:31:02.586 --> 02:31:04.488
AS FAR AS THE INCENTIVES THIS

02:31:04.555 --> 02:31:07.691

02:31:07.758 --> 02:31:09.593
OTHER HARM SO I JUST WANT TO

02:31:09.660 --> 02:31:11.929

MISTER RAISED ABOUT- INCENTIVES

02:31:16.333 --> 02:31:19.370
TO MAKE. YES MY HARM HOMEOWNERS.

02:31:19.437 --> 02:31:20.838
WELL IT DOESN'T HARM THE

02:31:20.905 --> 02:31:22.673
HOMEOWNER BECAUSE IN THE THIS

02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:24.175
BILL IS ONLY IMPACTING

02:31:24.241 --> 02:31:25.843
FORECLOSED PROPERTY SO THE

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:27.244
HOMEOWNERS ALREADY FACING THE

02:31:27.311 --> 02:31:28.679
SITUATION OF THEIR PROPERTY

02:31:28.746 --> 02:31:31.115
BEING FORECLOSED BUT WHAT IT

02:31:31.182 --> 02:31:32.683
DOES DO IS GIVE THAT HOMEOWNER

02:31:32.750 --> 02:31:34.819
IF THEY CAN'T IN THE FORTY FIVE

02:31:34.885 --> 02:31:38.923
DAY WINDOW- PUT TOGETHER A BID

02:31:38.989 --> 02:31:41.392
THAT WOULD MEET. THE BID THAT

02:31:41.459 --> 02:31:42.460
WAS FIRST INITIATED IN THE

02:31:42.526 --> 02:31:44.528
AUCTION TO BE ABLE TO BUY TO

02:31:44.595 --> 02:31:46.931
GET THEIR HOPE. AND CERTAINLY

02:31:46.997 --> 02:31:48.866
IN THE LAST FORECLOSURE CRISIS

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:51.669
WE SAW IN EXPERIENCE THAT MANY

02:31:51.735 --> 02:31:53.370
OF THOSE WERE FORECLOSED ON. IT

02:31:53.437 --> 02:31:56.006
WAS DUE TO THE TERMS OF THEIR

02:31:56.073 --> 02:32:03.914
LOAN. AND THAT THE- IN THE U.

02:32:03.981 --> 02:32:04.682
THEY WERE GIVEN BAD LOAN BY A

02:32:04.748 --> 02:32:06.717
LENDER AND THAT IT WASN'T THAT

02:32:06.784 --> 02:32:08.519
THEY WERE COMPLETELY WITHOUT

02:32:08.586 --> 02:32:10.955
CAPITAL OR CASH THEY JUST COULD

02:32:11.021 --> 02:32:12.189
NOT MEET THE TURN THEIR FELT

02:32:12.256 --> 02:32:13.891
PROPERTY WAS NO LONGER THE SAME

02:32:13.958 --> 02:32:14.792
VALUE AND THEY COULD NOT MEET

02:32:14.859 --> 02:32:16.694
THE TERMS OF THAT EXISTING LONG

02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:18.762
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THIS EXISTED

02:32:18.829 --> 02:32:20.231
DURING THE LAST FORECLOSURE

02:32:20.297 --> 02:32:22.533
CRISIS WE MAY HAVE HAD MORE OF

02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:24.869
THOSE. HOMEOWNERS FACING

02:32:24.935 --> 02:32:27.071

PURCHASED OF HOMES IT'S NOT BUT

02:32:33.577 --> 02:32:37.147

02:32:37.214 --> 02:32:39.450
WINDOW. IF THE INITIAL BID. A

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:41.418

WHOEVER PUTS IN. A HIGH BID.

02:32:44.722 --> 02:32:45.856
THEN THERE'S A FORTY FIVE DAY

02:32:45.923 --> 02:32:48.692
WINDOW FOR THE TENANTS. OR THE

02:32:48.759 --> 02:32:50.995

AND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:56.667
ENTITY TO BE ABLE TO- OUTBID

02:32:56.734 --> 02:32:58.769
THAT. IF THERE'S NO OUT BEATING

02:32:58.836 --> 02:33:00.571

02:33:00.638 --> 02:33:02.773
INITIAL BID. GETS TO PROCEED

THE HOME THAT WAS UNDER

02:33:08.979 --> 02:33:11.081
FORECLOSURE WOULD CONCEIVABLY

02:33:11.148 --> 02:33:13.817
AMIN IN THE WORST CASE.

02:33:13.884 --> 02:33:16.287
ATTENTION WE SOMEONE NOT

02:33:16.353 --> 02:33:19.590
MAINTAIN IT BUT- WE HAD A MUCH

02:33:19.657 --> 02:33:22.126
HIGHER SPECTER OF ENTITIES THAT

PACKED ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS

02:34:01.765 --> 02:34:03.434
HORRIBLE WE'RE NOT GOING TO

FACE THAT TYPE OF CIRCUMSTANCE

02:34:05.703 --> 02:34:06.704
IN THIS CASE BECAUSE WE ARE

02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:10.174

MISTER BELOW IMAGINED MIGHT

OCCUR IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES BUT

02:34:24.588 --> 02:34:28.158
IT WOULD BE FEW. OTHER

02:34:28.225 --> 02:34:29.960
QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISSOURI

02:34:30.027 --> 02:34:32.062
THANK YOU AT FIRST I WANT TO

02:34:32.129 --> 02:34:33.464

SENATOR A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY

02:34:35.399 --> 02:34:39.803
AND THEN I WANT TO MENTION IT

02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:41.372
JUST THAT YOU KNOW IN THE LAST

02:34:41.438 --> 02:34:43.107
CONVERSATION WE HAD ABOUT PRIOR

02:34:43.173 --> 02:34:44.475
BILLS THIS IS PART OF THE

02:34:44.541 --> 02:34:45.876
SOLUTION. THE ASSEMBLY BANKING

02:34:45.943 --> 02:34:47.411
AND FINANCE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN

02:34:47.478 --> 02:34:49.747
LOOKING AT FOR CLOSURE DATE AT-

02:34:49.813 --> 02:34:51.749
FOR THE LAST RECESSION BETWEEN

02:34:51.815 --> 02:34:52.282
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN TWO

02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:54.585
THOUSAND TWELVE. AND WE WERE

02:34:54.652 --> 02:34:56.720
SADLY REMINDED THAT IMPACTED

02:34:56.787 --> 02:35:00.791
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WE ARE

NOT TALKING ABOUT LITTLE

02:35:01.992 --> 02:35:03.994
NUMBERS- AND SO I THINK THAT

02:35:04.061 --> 02:35:05.963
WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO ENSURE

02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:08.365
THAT OUR HOUSING CRISIS- IS NOT

02:35:08.432 --> 02:35:10.768

RECESSION IS IMPORTANT. AND I

02:35:12.569 --> 02:35:13.070
THINK YOU'VE MADE AMENDMENTS

02:35:13.137 --> 02:35:14.938
AND CHANGES- AND CERTAINLY IS

02:35:15.005 --> 02:35:16.373
PART OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY HOW

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:19.343
WE KEEP- INDIVIDUALS IT IN

02:35:19.410 --> 02:35:21.145
THEIR HOME BUT ALSO ALLOW THAT

02:35:21.211 --> 02:35:22.680
THE HOUSING MARKET IS

02:35:22.746 --> 02:35:24.214
ACCEPTABLE AT EVERY BE CALLOUS

02:35:24.281 --> 02:35:29.253

WAY THAT'S MORE YOU KNOW. MORE

02:35:30.688 --> 02:35:32.389
THIRTY AND THEN FOR PEOPLE WHO

02:35:32.456 --> 02:35:35.659

PEOPLE BODIES OF FORECLOSURE

02:35:54.445 --> 02:35:55.345
THEY TURN AROUND AND RUN ABOUT

02:35:55.412 --> 02:35:57.047
TWO PEOPLE AND THAT PROVIDES

02:35:57.114 --> 02:35:58.082
HOUSING A LOT OF TIMES THEY

02:35:58.148 --> 02:35:59.717
RENOVATE THAT PROPERTY AND THEY

02:35:59.783 --> 02:36:02.186
CAN BRING IT UP. TO A BETTER

02:36:02.252 --> 02:36:03.487

ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THERE

02:36:19.837 --> 02:36:23.073
MAYBE IT'S A LOCAL SOLUTION

02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:23.640
MAYBE THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO

02:36:23.707 --> 02:36:24.675
PROTECT. DRESS THAT BUT IT JUST

02:36:24.742 --> 02:36:27.711

02:37:01.011 --> 02:37:03.914
BUT OKAY YOU DID WHEN YOU GOT

02:37:03.981 --> 02:37:06.917
THE BID THAT FORTY FIVE DAYS.

02:37:06.984 --> 02:37:08.552
PEOPLE HAVE TO COME IN AND JUST

02:37:08.619 --> 02:37:12.656
KIND OF. A ONE DOLLAR MORE. IT

02:37:12.723 --> 02:37:13.924
TO ME DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE

02:37:13.991 --> 02:37:17.461
MOST AFFECTED WERE FAIR PROCESS.

02:37:17.528 --> 02:37:18.962
AND AGAIN NOT WHAT I'M SEEING

02:37:19.029 --> 02:37:20.631
IS THE MARKET REALLY DOES SEEM

02:37:20.697 --> 02:37:23.267
TO WORK- IN PROVIDING FOR

02:37:23.333 --> 02:37:26.203
UPGRADED AND MORE HOUSING AND

02:37:26.270 --> 02:37:28.839
RENTALS- I'M JUST NOT SEEN THE

02:37:28.906 --> 02:37:30.774
NEED TO ESTABLISH THIS IS A

02:37:30.841 --> 02:37:33.210
STATE WIDE POLICY YEAH THOUGH I

02:37:33.277 --> 02:37:34.578
DO. I MEAN I'M LISTEN I'M

02:37:34.645 --> 02:37:35.946
HEARING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HAS

02:37:36.013 --> 02:37:39.316
BEEN GOING ON IN THE EAST BAY-

02:37:39.383 --> 02:37:41.218
AND CERTAINLY THAT'S A PROBLEM.

02:37:41.285 --> 02:37:44.121
THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE ISSUE

02:37:44.188 --> 02:37:45.923
BUT TO RESPOND CERTAINLY I GAVE

02:37:45.989 --> 02:37:47.491
YOU A PERSONAL EXAMPLE BECAUSE

02:37:47.558 --> 02:37:48.725
WHERE I LIVE BUT IT WAS NOT

02:37:48.792 --> 02:37:50.527
UNIQUE BUT LET'S LET'S SET THAT

02:37:50.594 --> 02:37:53.430
ASIDE USE THE TERM GAMING I

02:37:53.497 --> 02:37:54.598
THINK ONE COULD SAY THAT WHAT

02:37:54.665 --> 02:37:57.634
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PREVENT

02:37:57.701 --> 02:37:58.535
THE GAMING OF A SYSTEM THAT

02:37:58.602 --> 02:38:02.372
WERE ACTUALLY. LEVEL THE OWNER

02:38:02.439 --> 02:38:03.340
OCCUPANT WHO'S UNDER

02:38:03.407 --> 02:38:06.944
FORECLOSURE FOR THE AFFORDABLE

02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:09.313
HOUSING ENTITY DOES NOT HAVE

02:38:09.379 --> 02:38:13.383
THE SAME ACCESS TO. LARGE

02:38:13.450 --> 02:38:15.252
AMOUNTS OF CASH AT THE MOMENT

02:38:15.319 --> 02:38:17.387
SOMETHING GOES ON TO AN AUCTION

02:38:17.454 --> 02:38:19.623
THE WAY THAT MANY OF THESE

02:38:19.690 --> 02:38:21.925
LARGE CORPORATIONS HALF AND SO

02:38:21.992 --> 02:38:23.694
UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM AN

02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:27.464
ENTITY. THE COMBINED BALK WITH

02:38:27.531 --> 02:38:30.100
CASH HAS THE ADVANTAGE SO THIS

02:38:30.167 --> 02:38:32.402
IS TRYING TO CREATE A MORE

02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:34.571
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD SO THAT.

02:38:34.638 --> 02:38:36.206
OTHER ENTITIES THAT ALSO

02:38:36.273 --> 02:38:38.375
DESERVE TO OWN HOMES WOULD BE

02:38:38.442 --> 02:38:40.744
ABLE TO COMPETE. AND I THINK IF

02:38:40.811 --> 02:38:44.047
WE- I MENTIONED AND I THINK

02:38:44.114 --> 02:38:47.184
THE- OR MISTRUST A DOCTOR FROM

02:38:47.251 --> 02:38:52.389
ONE HUNDRED. THAT NOT ONLY WELL.

02:38:52.456 --> 02:38:53.457
THERE WAS A GROUP THERE WAS A

02:38:53.523 --> 02:38:55.626
VERY SIGNIFICANT DROP IN BLACK

02:38:55.692 --> 02:38:58.528
AND LET LET NEXT HOMEOWNERSHIP.

02:38:58.595 --> 02:38:59.796
IN GENERAL THERE WAS A

02:38:59.863 --> 02:39:01.665
SIGNIFICANT DROP IN HOME OWNER

02:39:01.732 --> 02:39:03.867
OCCUPANT HOMEOWNERSHIP THREATS

02:39:03.934 --> 02:39:04.468
TO CALIFORNIA WHICH STILL HAS

02:39:04.534 --> 02:39:06.637
NOT RECOVERED. AND WHEN WE

02:39:06.703 --> 02:39:09.072
THINK ABOUT. WHAT OF

02:39:09.139 --> 02:39:11.875
HOMEOWNERSHIP REPRESENTS IN OUR

02:39:11.942 --> 02:39:15.746
COUNTRY. AND THE ABILITY FOR IT

02:39:15.812 --> 02:39:17.214
FOR CREATING RETIREMENT

02:39:17.281 --> 02:39:18.949
SECURITY GENERATIONAL WEALTH

02:39:19.016 --> 02:39:21.318
AND SO MUCH MORE IT SEEMS TO ME

02:39:21.385 --> 02:39:22.119
WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING

02:39:22.185 --> 02:39:25.822
WE CAN. TO ENSURE THAT

02:39:25.889 --> 02:39:28.325
INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO OWN AN

02:39:28.392 --> 02:39:29.927
OCCUPIED THEIR HOME HAVE AT

02:39:29.993 --> 02:39:32.529
LEAST AS FEAR OF AN ADVANTAGE

02:39:32.596 --> 02:39:34.464
IN A PROCESS LIKE THIS AS AN

02:39:34.531 --> 02:39:37.701
ENTITY THAT HAS ACCESS TO A LOT

02:39:37.768 --> 02:39:40.170
OF CASH. JUST AS A QUICK FALL

02:39:40.237 --> 02:39:41.071
TO THAT I MEAN I AGREE WITH

02:39:41.138 --> 02:39:42.673
EVERYTHING HE SAID THE LAST

02:39:42.739 --> 02:39:44.708
PART OF WHAT YOU SAID THERE.

02:39:44.775 --> 02:39:46.977
BUT IN TERMS OF I MEAN CORRECT

02:39:47.044 --> 02:39:48.312
ME IF I'M WRONG BUT FOR

02:39:48.378 --> 02:39:49.112
CLOSURES THERE IS A NOTICE

02:39:49.179 --> 02:39:51.181

USUALLY POSTED IN NEWSPAPERS SO

02:39:53.283 --> 02:39:54.051
AND I THINK IT'S AT LEAST

02:39:54.117 --> 02:39:56.153
THIRTY DAYS. SO ALL THOSE

02:39:56.219 --> 02:39:57.854
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE NOTICE OF THE

02:39:57.921 --> 02:39:59.389
FACT IT THIS PROPERTY IS UP FOR

02:39:59.456 --> 02:40:01.925
FORECLOSURE. AND SO FREEZING

02:40:01.992 --> 02:40:03.293
LIKE ONLY THE PEOPLE CAN

02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:04.461
ACTUALLY QUICKLY I MEAN

02:40:04.528 --> 02:40:06.596
EVERYBODY HAS THAT SAME NOTICE

02:40:06.663 --> 02:40:09.266
IN A PUBLIC. A FORMER NEWSPAPER

02:40:09.333 --> 02:40:12.469
OTHERWISE. AT WHICH THEY COULD.

02:40:12.536 --> 02:40:15.339
COME UP WITH THE CASH OR NOT SO

02:40:15.405 --> 02:40:16.673
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THE PROCESS

02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:18.842
THE EXISTING. PROCESS SORT OF

02:40:18.909 --> 02:40:20.277
BELIES WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE

02:40:20.344 --> 02:40:21.778
THAT ONLY THE PEOPLE THAT CAN

02:40:21.845 --> 02:40:23.747
COME UP REALLY QUICKLY WITH

02:40:23.814 --> 02:40:25.816
MONEY AND AGAIN I MEAN IF YOU

02:40:25.882 --> 02:40:26.750
DON'T HAVE THE MONEY AT THAT

02:40:26.817 --> 02:40:28.318
TIME. WHAT'S TO SAY YOU'RE

02:40:28.385 --> 02:40:30.087
GONNA HAVE AN IN FORTY FIVE

02:40:30.153 --> 02:40:32.222
DAYS I MEAN THAT'S NOT. WE'RE

02:40:32.289 --> 02:40:33.090
NOT TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE LOT

02:40:33.156 --> 02:40:34.791
OF DIFFERENCE OF TIME THERE IF

02:40:34.858 --> 02:40:36.827
YOU'VE ALREADY HAD THIRTY DAYS.

02:40:36.893 --> 02:40:39.129
FOR INSTANCE BUT I MEAN CORRECT

02:40:39.196 --> 02:40:41.064
ME IF I'M WRONG ON THAT PROCESS.

02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:42.833
WELL THERE IS SOME NOTICE

02:40:42.899 --> 02:40:44.368
THERE'S ALSO UNDER THE CURRENT

02:40:44.434 --> 02:40:46.203
SYSTEM THE BALK AUCTION WHICH

02:40:46.269 --> 02:40:47.871
IT GIVES AN ADVANTAGE TO AN

02:40:47.938 --> 02:40:49.406
ENTITY THAT CAN PURCHASE

02:40:49.473 --> 02:40:51.975
MULTIPLE AT ONCE. VERSUS THE

02:40:52.042 --> 02:40:54.044
PERSON WHO'S JUST TRYING TO BUY

02:40:54.111 --> 02:40:57.347
THAT SINGLE PROPERTY EITHER THE

02:40:57.414 --> 02:41:05.288
OWNER OCCUPANT OR THE TENANT.

02:41:05.355 --> 02:41:06.623
THIS SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU

02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:08.125
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD

02:41:08.191 --> 02:41:11.194
I THINK THIS DOES FALL INTO THE

02:41:11.261 --> 02:41:12.729
CATEGORIES MISS LIMóN SAID OF.

02:41:12.796 --> 02:41:13.630
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE

02:41:13.697 --> 02:41:15.332
ADDRESSING GIVEN WHAT'S COMING

02:41:15.399 --> 02:41:17.067
BUT TO ME IT ALSO FALLS IN THE

02:41:17.134 --> 02:41:18.168
CATEGORY OF LESSONS LEARNED

02:41:18.235 --> 02:41:20.437
FROM THE LAST HOUSING CRISIS. I

02:41:20.504 --> 02:41:21.605
CAN REMEMBER THROUGH THAT

02:41:21.671 --> 02:41:24.007
CRISIS PEOPLE AT THE COUNTY

02:41:24.074 --> 02:41:26.143
STEPS WHO HAD THE RESOURCES THE

02:41:26.209 --> 02:41:28.145
FACILITIES SNATCHING UP HOMES.

02:41:28.211 --> 02:41:29.646
THROUGH THE OPTIONS IN THE

02:41:29.713 --> 02:41:30.881
FORECLOSURE PROCESS IN IN A WAY

02:41:30.947 --> 02:41:32.649
THAT REALLY FOR PRECLUDED

02:41:32.716 --> 02:41:34.651
OTHERS INTO MANY OF THOSE. WERE

02:41:34.718 --> 02:41:35.886
BOUGHT ON SPECULATION NOT

02:41:35.952 --> 02:41:37.921
ACTUALLY OCCUPIED AND WE ALSO

02:41:37.988 --> 02:41:40.390
HAD IN MORE RURAL AREAS. A LOT

02:41:40.457 --> 02:41:41.658
OF HOMES NOT BEING OCCUPIED%

02:41:41.725 --> 02:41:43.560
THAT THEN BECAME PROBLEMS IN

02:41:43.627 --> 02:41:45.629
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS SO I THINK

02:41:45.695 --> 02:41:46.863
THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE STEP

02:41:46.930 --> 02:41:50.167
AND- EIGHT A VERY GOOD SOLUTION

02:41:50.233 --> 02:41:53.437

02:41:53.503 --> 02:41:54.237
OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAD

LEARNED ABOUT BEFORE THAT'S WHY

02:41:56.039 --> 02:41:57.474

LIKE THE ONE I DESCRIBED WILL

03:11:46.461 --> 03:11:47.662
BEFRAUDULENT THAT WE COULDN'T

PUT THIS IN THE STATUTE WELL

03:11:51.366 --> 03:11:53.134
IT'S JUST IT'S JUST IT'S IT

03:11:53.201 --> 03:11:55.237
MARKS UP THE EXEMPTIONS WE

03:11:55.303 --> 03:11:56.638
NORMALLY JUST SAY THESE ARE THE

03:11:56.705 --> 03:11:58.707
EXCEPTIONS THAT THE SECTIONS

03:11:58.773 --> 03:12:00.208
UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY. CODE

03:12:00.275 --> 03:12:01.509
ENTERED THE FIVE HUNDRED

03:12:01.576 --> 03:12:03.278
SECTIONS GIVE ALL THESE POWERS

03:12:03.345 --> 03:12:04.546
TO THE TRUSTEE TO DO THINGS AND

THEY HAVE PLUS THE STATE

03:12:13.121 --> 03:12:13.655
INTERPRETATION SO IT WOULD BE

03:12:13.722 --> 03:12:14.356
IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT.

03:12:14.422 --> 03:12:16.258
DIFFERENT SECTIONS THE FEDERAL

03:12:16.324 --> 03:12:18.393
GOVERNMENT JUST GAVE STATES THE

03:12:18.460 --> 03:12:19.861

IN THE ANSWER MIGHT BE THE SAME

03:12:31.373 --> 03:12:33.074
I'M THINKING. BUT THERE'S

03:12:33.141 --> 03:12:34.409
NOTHING THAT PREVENTSSOMEONE

03:12:34.476 --> 03:12:35.977

OF A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN

03:12:39.147 --> 03:12:39.714
AFTER IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED SO.

03:12:39.781 --> 03:12:41.216
IN THEORY A BAD ACTOR COULD

03:12:41.283 --> 03:12:43.685
ESTABLISH MANY DIFFERENT FIVE

03:12:43.752 --> 03:12:45.120

CONSOLIDATE THEM BACK INTO A

03:12:49.024 --> 03:12:50.492

THEY HAVE TO BE SPENT ON A- ON

03:13:03.471 --> 03:13:05.240
THAT THE EDUCATION PLAN FIRST

03:13:05.307 --> 03:13:08.510
FOR SOME FOR SOMEBODY- WE'RE AS

03:13:08.576 --> 03:13:11.413

PROTECTED BY THE BANKRUPTCY

03:13:26.995 --> 03:13:27.562
CODE RIGHT NOW SO I DON'T KNOW

03:13:27.629 --> 03:13:29.030
