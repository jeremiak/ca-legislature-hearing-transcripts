SO ULTIMATELY IN ORDER TO BILL

00:51:06.129 --> 00:51:07.831
PEOPLE CORRECTLY THERE WOULD

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:09.266
ONLY BE POTENTIALLY TWO BILLION

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:11.101

AND MAIL IT OUT SO. I WOULD BE

00:51:17.507 --> 00:51:18.775
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:20.677
MONTHLY BILLING SYSTEM THAT

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:22.746
WITH EVEN ACROSS ALL. TWELVE

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:24.347

THAT RAISE THE COST OF THE TAX

00:51:30.654 --> 00:51:31.755
BILL AND SO WE DON'T KNOW

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:32.789
WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ON THERE

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:34.558
UNTIL WE GET IT FROM THE OTHER.

00:51:34.624 --> 00:51:35.759
AND THAT WOULD GIVE US ONLY TWO

00:51:35.826 --> 00:51:42.532
MONTHS FOR THAT FIRST ONE EVEN.

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:43.200
IF YOU SMARTPAY HAS TO TRUE- AT.

00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:44.901
AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO- IT

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:45.535

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:46.770
THAT TO. I AS FAR AS DEMAND FOR

00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:48.605

THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND A LOT

00:52:01.818 --> 00:52:03.620
OF MONEY. I INVESTING IN SOME

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:05.856
SORT OF OFFICE- OFFLINE

00:52:05.922 --> 00:52:07.891
TRACKING SYSTEMS. THAT WOULD

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.493
THEN BE USED VERY VERY FEW

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:10.660
PEOPLE WHICH MEANS THAT THOSE

00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:11.595

OF- SOLAR PANELS IN THE AMOUNT

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.437
OF. EXPOSURE DOES IF THIS TAX

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:43.805
STRUCTURE OF JUST FINANCING

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.106
INVESTMENT STRUCTURE WAS

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:46.107
PERCEIVED THE WAY THEY'RE

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:49.778
TALKING ABOUT NOW SECONDLY THE

01:20:49.844 --> 01:20:50.412
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:51.646
THEY'RE TALKING AS MEGAWATTS

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:53.982
WHATEVER THE NUMBERS WERE. THE

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:54.816
THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:56.084
WOULD NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE

01:20:56.151 --> 01:20:58.320
INVESTORS WOULD NOT INVEST THE

01:20:58.386 --> 01:20:59.621
WAY THE FLIP WORKS AND THE WAY

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.223
THE RISK PROFILE WORKS IN THESE

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:03.258
SITUATIONS IS THAT INVESTORS

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:04.459
INVEST THEY WANT THEIR MONEY

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.561
BACK FIRST. THIS WAS A

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:07.862
CHALLENGE BECAUSE BY BOARD OF

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:09.331
EQUALIZATION RECENT

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:11.333
INTERPRETATION THAT WAS NEVER

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.134
IT THEY ARE RAISING A LARGER

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:15.270
ISSUE. ABOUT HOW WE AS A

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:18.974
GOVERNMENT CHOOSE TO SUBSIDIZE-

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.375
SOLAR ENERGY AND TO TRY TO

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:21.443
INCENTIVIZE SOLAR EDGE I GET

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:23.578
THAT AND I'M TOLD THAT THEY

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:25.280
PROVIDES PUT JUST 53% FROM THAT

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:27.282
COUNTY LEGITIMATE ISSUE. BUT

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:28.583
IT'S NOT RELATED TO THIS

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:30.619
MEASURE IT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE

01:21:30.685 --> 01:21:31.820
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:32.887
HERE IS A LITTLE LEVERAGE JOB A

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:34.689
LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S OKAY YOU

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:35.790
KNOW IT'S WORTH THE DISCUSSION

01:21:35.857 --> 01:21:37.325
WE'VE LIMITED TO ONE FLIP ONLY

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:38.893
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THE PURPOSE

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.028
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO. KEEP

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:40.829
FLIPPING THESE THINGS ARE JUST

01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:41.863
TRYING TO LEGITIMIZE THE

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:42.764
UNDERLYING FINANCIAL

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:44.833
TRANSACTIONS SO. I JUST WANT TO

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:45.900

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:47.202
I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:48.436
OUT AND IN A NUMBER OF FOLKS OF

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:50.071
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT AND I GET

01:21:50.138 --> 01:21:52.207
IT. AND AS YOU KNOW WE DEVELOP

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:53.842
PUBLIC POLICY IN THIS PLACE

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:55.243
OFTEN THINGS CHANGE I REMEMBER

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:56.511
WHEN THE INTERNET WASN'T TAXED

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.113
AND THEN IT STARTED TO BECOME

01:21:58.179 --> 01:21:59.748
TAXED RIGHT BECAUSE THE CHANGE

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:00.949
CHANGE AND THESE WILL CHANGE

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:02.884
OVER TIME. AS WE MATURE AND

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:04.653
DEVELOP THESE PROCESSES BUT

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:06.288
