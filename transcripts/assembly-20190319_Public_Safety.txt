THE CALIFORNIA VICTIMS ARE COMPENSATION PROGRAM CAVS V. C. B.. COVERS ALL COSTS UP TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES FUNERAL AND BURIAL MANY OF THE SERVICES AND THE SUPPORT.

REMEMBER THANK YOUR ACCOUNT ON CAP HERE MCCUE CAP CAN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. AS THE ASSEMBLYMAN MENTIONED -- MARCY'S LAW OUT PROPOSITION NINE PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT DID A FOR CRIME VICTIMS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF FOR REPRESENTATION TO BE HEARD -- AND MUCH MORE PROCESS -- THAT SAID YOU KNOW -- THERE IS IN EQUITY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS WHEREBY -- THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES AND AND FOR DEFENDANTS TO BE PROVIDED STATE PAID COUNSEL AT THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS WERE AS VICTIMS UNLESS THEY'RE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT THEMSELVES. I DON'T HAVE SOMEONE ACTING SOLELY ON THEIR BEHALF -- AND SO BY A BEFORE FOUR FIVE WOULD AUTHORIZE ARE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR VICTIM REIMBURSEMENT FOR COUNSEL TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR NEEDS THEIR REPRESENTATION SPECIFICALLY -- THROUGHOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE JUSTICE PROCESS NO CRIME VICTIMS UNITED IN PARTICULAR WORKS VERY CLOSELY WITH THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS OUT TO REPRESENT. A VICTIMS -- BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD ON PAROLE DECISIONS AND WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF TIMES WHERE THE VICTIM IS NOT NECESSARILY BAN -- RIGHTFULLY AFFORDED -- THEIR FULL OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD -- AND EVEN IN SOME CASES ARE WHERE THEY THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS COMMISSIONER IS EVEN UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT IS AFFORDED TO VICTIMS. OF THIS BILL AB FOUR FOUR FIVE WOULD HELP PROVIDE. AN EQUITY -- IN THE SYSTEM SUCH THAT A SIMILAR TO DEFENDANT'S BE PROVIDED STATE PAID COUNSEL ARE VICTIMS WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT OF FOUR REPRESENTATION LEGALLY ON THEIR BEHALF AS WELL. WE THINK THIS IS AN EQUITABLE HOW CONSIDERATION ON AND WOULD APPRECIATE RIFLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NAY. MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. THE KIND OF COMPENSATION PROPOSED UNDER A BEFORE FORTY FIVE IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER PROVIDED TO VICTIMS THROUGH THE VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD. OTHER COMPENSATION COMPENSATE VICTIMS FOR HARMS THAT DIRECTLY FLOW FROM THE CRIME FOR EXAMPLE MEDICAL EXPENSES COUNSELING EXPENSES -- COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF INCOME. PAYING OF VICTIMS' ATTORNEYS FEES COMPENSATES THAT PERSON FOR A CHOICE AS TO HOW THEY ARE GOING TO ENGAGE IN THE CRIMINAL TO WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM -- WHERE THAT PERSON HAS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO ASSERT -- HIS OR HER RIGHTS -- SUCH AS ASKING THE ASSISTANCE OF THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY WITH WITH PUTTING WITH ASSERTING THOSE RIGHTS -- OR SEEKING HELP FROM A VICTIMS SERVING THOSE RIGHTS ON HIS OR HER OWN BEHALF -- THERE ARE MANY RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO VICTIMS -- TO INFORM THEM OF THOSE RIGHTS AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY -- IS REQUIRED TO HELP THEM -- PRESERVE THOSE RIGHTS UPON REQUEST -- MAKING NEW SOURCES OF MONEY AVAILABLE FOR PRIVATE ATTORNEYS WILL ENCOURAGE VICTIMS TO HIRE ATTORNEYS -- EVEN WHEN THAT IS NOT NEEDED AND MAY NOT BE THE BEST WAY TO ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS -- EVEN AN ATTORNEY WHO IS. PUTTING THE SYSTEM COMPLETELY ETHICALLY OF COURSE HAS SOME. FINANCIAL INCENTIVE -- TO WANT TO SHOW UP AT MORE HEARINGS WANT. WANT THE VICTIM TO BE MORE OF A PARTICIPANT AND IN THE PROCESS -- EVEN WHEN THAT MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR THE PARTICULAR VICTIM OR WHERE THOSE RIGHT WHERE THE VICTIMS PARTICIPATION COULD HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. OTHERWISE -- THE END RESULT WILL BE TO TILT THE BALANCE OF COURT PROCEEDINGS NOT IN FAVOR OF THE ACTUAL PARTICULAR INTERESTS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL VICTIM. BUT TOWARDS THE ROAD APPROACH THAT WILL RESULT IN A GREATER USE OF PRIVATE COUNSEL IN A SYSTEM THAT -- THAT NOW HAS -- OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION GOOD MORNING -- CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSES A. B. -- FOUR FOUR FIVE BECAUSE IT IS UNNECESSARY VICTIMS RIGHTS ARE ALREADY PROTECTED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE ONE SECTION. TWENTY EIGHT EN COUNTY PROSECUTORS WHO DO THEIR JOB WITHOUT THE PROFIT MOTIVE -- INCENTIVIZE STE BY THIS BILL ENSURE THAT VICTIMS RECEIVE THOSE RIGHTS. UNDER CURRENT LAW A VICTIM IS ALREADY ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEY FEES AS PART OF A CRIMINAL RESTITUTION. PROVIDED THAT THOSE FEES ARE BOTH REASONABLE AND WE'RE SPENT RECOVERING FOR AN ACTUAL LOSS SUFFERED BY THE VICTIM. THIS CAREFUL BALANC ALLOWS VICTIMS TO OBTAIN LEGAL ASSISTANCE WORDS NECESSARY TO RECOVER FROM AN ACTUAL LOSS. AND WE BELIEVE AB FOUR OR FIVE IS BAD POPUP PUBLIC POLICY BECAUSE IT PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE. FOR SOME UNSCRUPULOUS LAWYERS TO DRAG OUT THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN ORDER TO SEEK MORE MONEY UNDER THE GUISE OF DOING. THE WORK THAT'S ACTUALLY ALREADY DONE IN MOST JURISDICTIONS BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY BY COUNTY PROSECUTORS. AND MOST LARGE -- OF COUNTIES HAVE -- VICTIMS WITNESS ASSISTANCE UNITS. THAT APPEAR IN COURT WITH THE VICTIMS WHEN THEY'RE REQUESTED. TO THEY SPEND TIME TALKING TO THE VICTIMS ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS. AND THEY NOTIFY THE VICTIMS WHEN THERE'S GOING TO BE A COURT HEARING WHAT'S GOING TO BE EXPECTED OF THEM -- THEY HELP THEM IF THEY WISH PREPARE THEY CAN -- MAKE AT SENTENCING OR AT ANY OTHER POINT IN THE PROCEEDINGS EXCEPT YOU KNOW THE CTUAL TOMORROW WHILE THEY'RE TESTIFYING. AND IF THE VICTIMS OR FEELING COMFORTABLE ON GIVING THE STATEMENTS THEMSELVES. THE VICTIM WITNESS ADVOCATE FOR THE PROSECUTOR WILL READ THE STATEMENT. SO THIS IS WORK THAT IS ALREADY PAID FOR IT'S ALREADY BEING DONE. AB FOUR FOUR FIVE SIX JUST TO TRANSFORM TRANSFORM MORE MONEY. FROM THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION. FUND TWO LAWYERS WHO ARE NOT NEEDED. IN THIS -- SCHEME OF THINGS. AND THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND AS URINALYSIS ALREADY SHOWS IS SERIOUSLY BEING DEPLETED. THIS WOULD BE AN ADDED EXPENSE. THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE BORNE BY THE EITHER THE TAXPAYERS VICTIMS OR INDIGENT DEFENDANTS. WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU OPPOSITION. WITH THAT ARE YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OF THE CALLER REPLIED YES MISTER LACKEY YEAH I I THINK -- I'M I'M CLEARLY GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL DAY. BUT THE DEFENSE DOES HAVE A VERY GOOD POINT ABOUT THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND WHICH IS NOT PRIMARILY YOUR PROBLEM AT BUT OUR PROBLEM. BECAUSE IT IS DEPLETING AND CUTTING OFF ITS SOURCE OF INCOME TO BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT -- IT'S UNFAIR TO PENALIZE PEOPLE FISCALLY BUT WE HAVE TO FIND SOME SOURCE. A FUNDING FOR THIS VICTIMS A COMPENSATION FUND. SO IT IS A LEGITIMATE THING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH. AND THIS IS NOT A FISCAL COMMITTEE THIS A POLICY COMMITTEE SO CLEARLY I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE [inaudible] OKAY. POSTED IN YOU MAY CLOSE ASSEMBLYMEMBER. THANK YOU AB FOUR FOUR FIVE IS -- SIMPLY -- SEEKING TO ELIMINATE THE LOOPHOLE. EXISTING IN MáS IS LAW. YES AVE TIM'S CAN RETAIN A TONY SERVICES THAT ARE ALREADY APPROVED. AND THE BE GIVEN EQUAL ACCESS SO REGARDLESS OF A FINANCIAL BACKGROUND. UP TO THE LEGAL SERVICES THIS IS SAW ARE NOT PRECEDING SELF BUT THIS HAS A SIMPLY HOW BRITISH SOFT VICTIMS OF UP TO PROTECT THAT THEY ARE RIGHT SO. OF FULLY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHOI FOR BRINGING THIS ON CHAIRS RECOMMENDING AND NO -- IT'S IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING WHEN YOU HAVE LAWYERS. SAYING LAWYERS ARE GETTING PAID TOO MUCH IT'S THIS -- KIND OF PERPLEXING SOMETIMES -- BUT MR LACKEY IS ABOUT A POINT ABOUT THE VICTIMS OF SYSTEM -- COMPENSATION FUN BEING DEPLETED AND THEN DIVERTING THAT MONEY -- FROM VICTIMS TWO ATTORNEYS I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE A MEANS OF PROGRAMS OUT ANTI ATTORNEY BUT DID TO DIVERT MORE. OF THOSE RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE VICTIMS WHO MAY NEED -- MONIES. FOR ECONOMIC REASONS FOR A MENTAL HEALTH -- AND YOU KNOW WHEN A TRAGEDY HAPPENS THERE'S A MYRIAD OF OTHER THINGS THAT THEY THAT THEY WILL NEED AND IT IT'S THIS IS DIFFICULT TO DIVERT. ANY OF THE LAST DEPLETING RESOURCES THAT WE HAVEN'T VICTIMS ASSISTANCE FUND -- OVER -- TO ATTORNEYS AND I THINK WE DO NEED TO FIX THE SYSTEM. IF THE IF THE D. A.'S ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB OF ENSURING THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN BE THERE AT HEARINGS YOU CAN PROVIDING YOU THE ASSISTANCE THAT YOU NEED AND YOU MEANING -- VICTIMS OF OF THE THEN WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB AT KEEPING THEM ENSURING THAT THAT THAT THEY DO THAT AND THAT WE WE DO THAT AND SO MAYBE IN ANOTHER CONVERSATION. AND ANOTHER TYPE OF LEGISLATION WE CAN WE CAN TALK ABOUT DOING THAT BECAUSE THAT IS MORE PERMANENT. THAT IS SOMETHING ALL THE THINGS THAT THE SOME WOMEN MENTION -- GAPS IN THE SYSTEM A LOT OF IT IS WE JUST IMPROVE THE SYSTEM -- WILL BE ABLE TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE PAIN ON THE VICTIMS OF CRIME. AND SO WITH THAT THE JUDGE RECOMMEND UNLIKE LOCATION. MY PROJECTOR CALL THE ROLL. ON A BEFORE FORTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JOHN SO YOU'RE NOW LACKEY. LACKEY I BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN NOT VOTING DEEP. HI. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE NO KAMLAGER-DOVE HAVE NO QUIRK. NO QUIRK NELL SANTIAGO. WICKS NO WICKS NOW.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NO ONE WANTS TO SIT WITH ME GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU THAT'S THE SIGN. I AM I AM SO HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU ALL HERE THIS MORNING I I MISSED THIS COMMITTEE SO IT'S NICE IT'S NICE TO BE BACK. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE STAFF I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB. SIX OH SEVEN A MODEST BUT IMPORTANT REFORM TO OUR CURRENT SENTENCING AND JUDICIAL PRACTICES. AB SIX OH SEVEN IS THE RE INTRODUCTION OF SB TEN TWENTY FIVE FROM SENATOR SKINNER WHICH PASSED THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. SENATOR SKINNER AND I ARE WORKING ON THIS BILL AGAIN -- THIS YEAR SHE IS THE CO AUTHOR ALONG WITH SENATOR MITCHELL WIENER BRADFORD AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK. FOR CERTAIN NON SERIOUS AND NON VIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS JUDGES TO EVALUATE ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE AND APPLY THEIR DISCRETION. IN SENTENCING. FOUR ZERO CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS JUDGES TO EVALUATE ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE AND APPLIED THEIR DISCRETION. IN SENTENCING INSTEAD EIGHT JUDGE IS FORCED TO CHARGE AND INCARCERATE A PERSON WHO WOULD BE BETTER TREATED AND SUPERVISED. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES UNDER PROBATION. AB SIX OR SEVEN ALLOWS JUDGES TO USE DISCRETION IN ORDER -- TO TO ALLOW PROBATION SERVICES FOR OFFENSES THAT CURRENTLY MANDATE INCARCERATION IN COUNTY JAILS AND STATE PRISONS. THIS BILL DOES NOT. BY CHANGE SENTENCING STRUCTURE OR AFFECT MAXIMUM SENTENCES UNDER. SIX OH SEVEN JUDGES WILL STILL CHOOSE TO SEND INDIVIDUALS TO PRISON OR JAIL BUT THIS BILL ALLOWS JUDGES TO WEIGH IN THE FAX. AND USE OTHER AVENUES OTHER METHODS TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE. PROBATION PROVIDE THE SERVICES UP PROVIDE SERVICES SUCH AS EFFECTIVE DRUG DRUG TREATMENTS THAN NOT THEY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN COUNTY JAILS WHICH WE KNOW IS CURRENTLY. UNAVAILABLE THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS TO MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR DRUG OFFENSES -- AND WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS NEXT TOWARD -- WOULDN'T WITH THE APPELLATE ATTORNEY HE'S AN APPELLATE ATTORNEY WITH THE ONLY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. GENET SAID SAID FUNNY BUT BEING FUNNY BUT THEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE THE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR FOR THE DRUG POLICY AND THE ELEVATOR CENTER. MOVE THE BILL. I THANK YOU NEXT ORDER NUMBER YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NEXT ROAD WITH THE LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS REFORM. AND WITH THE TIME I HAVE I I JUST WANTED TO AND TRY TO PUT A FACE ON WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- I MYSELF HAVE REPRESENTED A NUMBER OF CLIENTS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE CURRENT LAW. AND CURRENT LAW ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A PRE EXISTING DRUG CONVICTION YOU HAVE A NEW DRUG CONVICTION THE JUDGE IS NOT ALLOWED TO PUT YOU ON PROBATION. EVEN WHEN THE JUDGE CONCLUDES IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY THE DEFENDANT AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT HE'D HERE SHE DO SO. ONE OF MY CLIENTS WHO WILL CALL AMY AM FIRST BECAME IN MASH THE COMMODE JUSTICE SYSTEM AT THE TENDER AGE OF TWELVE HER MOTHER ALSO A DRUG USER -- HAD TWELVE YEAR OLD AMY HELPER INJECT HEROIN BECAUSE HER MOTHER'S VEINS HAD COLLAPSED -- MY TWELVE YEAR OLD THAN CLIENT WAS REQUIRED TO INJECT. THE VEINS IN HER MOTHER'S GROWING AND ASK YOU TAKE JUST A MINUTE AND THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN CHILDREN IMAGINE THAT KIND OF LIFE FOR A KID. THAT TIME I HAD A ME AS A CLIENT SHE WAS IN HER ACTIONS BEHIND HER. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM WHO THINKS IF AMY WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT TREATMENT AND A JUDGE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS APPROPRIATE THAT THAT JUDGE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO DIRECT. AMY INTO TREATMENT AND UNDER THE CURRENT LAW THE JUDGE WAS NOT AND I BELIEVE THAT COMMITTEE WITH THIS AT THIS -- BODIES OWN AND NOT ANALYST INDICATES THAT CURRENTLY INCARCERATING PEOPLE LIKE ME COST THE CITY CALIFORNIA EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR -- TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY IF WE KEEP TO AMY'S OUT OF CUSTODY WE CAN PUT A KID THROUGH A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE -- EVERY TIME WE DO IT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING -- COMMITTEE CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JEANETTE CITY BY CLEAN I'M AN ATTORNEY AND THE STATE DIRECTOR. FOR THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE I AM HERE ALSO -- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SIX OF SEVEN AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THEIR STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AT THAN AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. TO GET RID OF MANDATORY MINIMUMS AND AS YOU HEARD MY COLLEAGUE HERE NEXT SPEAK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. TO GIVE JUDGES -- THE JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN TERMS OF ALLOWING FOLKS TO LIKE HEALTH MORE -- AT DIGNITY CENTERED FOCUSED -- PERSPECTIVE AND SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL FOR THOSE REASONS -- THE OTHER THING I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT OBVIOUSLY IS THAT FROM DRUG POLICIES PERSPECTIVE -- WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A A RACIAL AND A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. WE KNOW THAT THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD HITTING ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES -- AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE REALLY. BELIEVE THAT GIVING JUDGES THE DISCUSSION -- TO OUT. DO ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING IN IN IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS OR HAVE THAT DISCRETION -- WOULD HELP REDUCE THE THE IMPACT THAT THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS HAD ON ON THESE COMMUNITIES -- AND THEN JUST REALLY QUICKLY -- TO COOK MICHELLE ALEXANDER ON THE AUTHOR OF THE NEW JIM CROW -- NOTHING HAS CONTRIBUTED MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR S. -- DRUGS AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER WELL SO THAT -- INCARCERATING INDIVIDUALS IS VERY COSTLY BOTH AT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- AS NICK MENTIONED JUST INCARCERATING SOMEONE FOR THREE YEARS COSTS -- APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND WE AS A SOCIETY COULD DO BETTER IN TERMS OF REALLY LOOKING AT FOLKS -- AND AT MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED THANK YOU.

THANK YOU I I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY PARTS OF THIS -- PROPOSAL THAT ARE SUPPORTABLE BUT I THERE THERE'S A PART OF IT IT'S A VERY VERY PERPLEXING TO ME IN.

THIRTY CURRENT LAW SAYS IT WOULD BE. THIRTY YOUR THIS PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE IT. MAKE INELIGIBLE TO OWN A FIREARM EARLIER. I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM. OF THIS TIME LIMIT OF DO YOU WANNA. YOU WANT TO DRESS IN YOUR CLOSING ADDRESS IT NOW ALL ADDRESS IT NOW UP MISTER LIKE I DON'T THINK THAT'S A THAT'S OUR BILL. WELL YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT BUT IT.

AN OFFENSE DESCRIBED IN SUBSECTION BE OF TWELVE OR TWENTY AT TWELVE OH THREE POINT. OH SEVEN THREE ANY OFFENSE ENUMERATED AND BLAH BLAH BLAH IS STRICKEN AND THAT IS. THE PROVISION I JUST OUTLINED. WELCOME BACK TO ON THE OKAY KAMLAGER-DOVE [inaudible] I'M. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL -- FORWARD I WILL BE THEM SUPPORTING AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT MORE WAYS TO OFFER DIVERSIONARY OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR JUDGES.

THE YOU KNOW ALSO SORT OF RECOGNIZES THAT BUT HAVING SAID THAT I THINK THIS IS ONE STEP CLOSER TOWARDS UNWINDING THE JIM CROW ERA LAWS THAT HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED POOR PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR FOR DECADES NOW SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU YES MISTER I CONSUMERS. FOR ALL RIGHT -- SO OBVIOUSLY IN VOTING FOR THIS IS A CO AUTHOR. OF WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO RISK TO TAKE A LOOK AT MR -- LACKEY. YEAH I KNOW.

SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU WELL WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE WHEN IT COMES TO JUDICIAL DISCRETION. IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR CONGRESS PASSED AND THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE FIRST STEP TACK INCLUDING AN EXPANSION OF COURT DISCRETION FOR MANDATORY MINIMUMS AND A REDUCTION IN SENTENCING IT'S FOR DRUG OFFENSES.

FIVE EIGHT TWO GAVIN'S LAW THIS BILL HAS BEEN NAMED FOR GAVIN GLADDING. A BELOVED VICE PRINCIPAL FROM CLOVIS. WHO WAS TRAGICALLY HIT AND KILLED IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS? WHILE HE WAS OUT FOR A RUN LAST SEPTEMBER -- GAVIN WAS A HUSBAND A FATHER A PASSIONATE EDUCATOR. A FORMER PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEER. HE WAS BELOVED BY ALL WHO KNEW HIM. THE DRIVER WHO KILLED GAVIN. DID NOT STOP [inaudible] TO HELP. EVEN AS GAVIN LAY THERE CLINGING TO LIFE THE DRIVER FLED THE SCENE. EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS DRIVER WAS DRINKING HEAVILY AT A PARTY JUST HOURS BEFORE. THE HIT AND RUN. BECAUSE HE FLED THE SCENE. AND WAS NOT CAUGHT FOR FIVE DAYS. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS COULD NOT PROVE HE WAS DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. RIGHT NOW IN CURRENT LAW. THERE IS A PERVERSE LOOPHOLE. WHICH ENCOURAGES ACTUALLY REWARDS DRIVERS. TO FLEE THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT. NOT TO STAY [inaudible] AND HELP [inaudible] BY FLEEING. THEY CAN PURPOSEFULLY AVOID ADDITIONAL CHARGES. FOR HIT AND RUN. AND FOR DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR A HIT AND RUN [inaudible] INVOLVING DEATH. IS FOUR YEARS. THE MAN WHO KILLED GAVIN WAS SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS HE WILL SERVE [inaudible] EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THIS SHORT SENTENCE ACTUALLY REWARDS THE DRIVER FOR LEAVING THE SCENE. AND FOR LEAVING GAVIN UNDER UNTENDED AND STRUGGLING TO STAY ALIVE. WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH AB? FOR FIVE EIGHTY TWO IS TO SEE TO IT THAT THE PENALTIES FOR LEAVING THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT. WHICH RESULTS IN DEATH OR GREAT BODILY INJURY. BY MAKING THESE PENALTIES. GREATER THAN THE PENALTY FOR A D. Y. AND BRINGING THEM IN LINE. WITH THE VEHICLE VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS REALLY CHANGE? WHAT IS? ESSENTIALLY SORT OF A PERVERSE. CULTURE WITH RESPECT TO HIT. AND RUN. WE WANT TO LET DRIVERS KNOW CLEARLY. THAT IF THEY HIT. HURT. KEEP A KILL AND RUN. THEY WILL FACE AS MUCH OR MORE TIME THEN IF THEY STAY. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WAS GAVIN'S WIFE SUSAN. AND RANDY PERRY REPRESENTING THE PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. A RESEARCH ASSOCIATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SIR YES. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SUSAN GLADDING AND I'M A RESIDENT OF CLOVIS CALIFORNIA AND FRESNO COUNTY. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE EIGHTY TWO AND KNOWN AS GAVIN'S Là. ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER SIXTEENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN MY LIFE IS CHANGED FOREVER MY HUSBAND. BEST FRIEND AND FATHER OF MY TWO CHILDREN GO INCLUDING WAS STOLEN FROM US BY RECKLESS DRIVER. AND THE DRIVERS REPORTEDLY HAVE BEEN DRINKING. IN THE EARLY HOURS OF SEPTEMBER SIXTEENTH. WHO DIDN'T HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE GOT INTO HIS PARENTS TRUCK LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND SWERVED INTO MY HUSBAND WHO IS DRIVING ALONG SIDE FRIED ROAD AND FRESNO? KEVIN SEVERED MAJOR INJURIES FROM THE COLLISION AND WITH LEFT DYING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS THE DRIVER FLED THE SCENE. HE DID NOT HAVE THE DECENCY TO STOP OR AT THE VERY LEAST CALL INSTEAD HE DROVE AWAY ORGANIZED THE REPAIR OF THE TRACK. AND RETURNED TO THE SCENE TWO TIMES THAT DAY WITH HIS FRIENDS TO ASSESS THE SUIT THE SITUATION. FROM THE MOMENT THAT THE DRIVER DECIDED TO DRIVE AWAY HIS ACTIONS WERE ENTIRELY SELF SERVING AND COWARDLY. THANKFULLY A WITNESS WAS JOGGING NEARBY AND WAS ABLE TO CALL AN AMBULANCE FOR GAVIN AND PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE VEHICLE. DEVASTATINGLY MY HUSBAND PASSED AWAY LATER THAT MORNING FROM THE INJURIES THAT HE SUSTAINED. THE DRIVER HIT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ALMOST A WEEK WELL MY FAMILY STRUGGLED WITH THE LOSS OF KEVIN. AND ALSO WITH THE WEIGHT OF NOT KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE. THE DRIVER TURNED HIMSELF IN. AS THE HIGHWAY TOGETHER AT THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL CLOSE IN TO ARREST HIM AND IT'S ULTIMATELY SENTENCE TO JUST THREE YEARS IN PRISON. SEPTEMBER SIXTEENTH IN THE WEEKS. SINCE HAVE BEEN A LIVING NIGHTMARE FOR MY FAMILY WHO ARE ALL PRESENT TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE EIGHTY TWO IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS SINCE THAT TERRIBLE DAY AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THE TRUCK. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE LIGHT SENDS THAT THE DRIVER RECEIVED AND THAT'S SIGNAL THAT IT SENDS TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS. THE WAY THAT THE CALIFORNIA LAW IS WRITTEN SEDATE INCENTIVIZE IS THE DRIVER TO FLEE THE SCENE RATHER THAN TO STOP IN THIS IS THE INDIVIDUAL THAT THEIR CRITICALLY INJURED WITH THEIR VEHICLE. THIS IS WHAT I AND OTHERS HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS CASE IT WAS IT HAS BROUGHT AWARENESS TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS A LOOPHOLE IN THE CURRENT LEGISLATION. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE LAW. AND IT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. AND CITIZENS LIKE MYSELF AND ALL OF YOU.

AND THE WAY THE LAW IS DRAFTED NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AT FAULT. IN THE ACCIDENT. UNDER -- TWENTY THOUSAND AND ONE YOU MERELY HAVE TO BE INVOLVED SO IF THE OTHER PARTY. COULD CAUSES THE ACCIDENT. AND YOU FULLY YOU'RE STILL. AND ALL MY CLIENTS -- HAVE FLED FOR MANY REASONS SOME OF THEM BECAUSE THEY FEARED. ON BEING DEPORTED SOME BECAUSE THEY WERE DRIVING ON A SUSPENDED DRIVER'S LICENSE. SOME OF THEM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE. BUT WHATEVER THE REASON WAS -- THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE LAW WAS OR WHAT THE SENTENCE WAS. AND THIS ON A BILL. OF WOOD WITH NOT BE A DETERRENT BECAUSE PEOPLE. IN THOSE SITUATIONS [inaudible] DON'T KNOW. ON A FIVE FULLY THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN -- UNFORTUNATELY WHAT INCREASING THE SENATE'S AND THIS BILL SEEKS TO ALMOST DOUBLE IT. IN EACH INSTANCE FROM TWO THREE OR FOUR TO FOUR FIVE OR SIX WITH INJURY CAUSING DEATH TWO THREE OR FOUR TO SIX SEVEN OR EIGHT AND ELIMINATES THE POSSIBILITY OF A MISDEMEANOR -- WINS -- WITH THE MINIMUM NINETY DAY JAIL SENTENCE. ALL IT DOES IS INCREASE INCARCERATION AND WE HAVE BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD BEFORE. WE HAVE TAKEN SCARCE PUBLIC RESOURCES TO BUILD MORE AND MORE PRISONS. AND IT HAS NOT BEEN A SUCCESS. FOR THOSE REASONS I ASKS FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND LET ME ALSO SAY THAT I OFFER MY SYMPATHY TO THE THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS -- I THINK ALL OF US IN IN RESPONSE TO A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS WANT TO FIND WAYS TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE -- UNFORTUNATELY INCREASING THE SENTENCES FOR FOR FLEEING THE SCENE ARE ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS OR INJURIES FROM CAR ACCIDENTS. OR EVEN TO TURN DRIVERS FROM FLEEING THE SCENE AFTER AN ACCIDENT -- INSTEAD IT TIES JUDGES HANDS SO THAT THEY ARE FORCED TO IMPOSE PRISON SENTENCES IN. THE CASES WHERE THOSE SENTENCES MAYBE LEAST APPROACH MORE PEOPLE TO PRISON FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME -- AND UNFORTUNATELY WITH LITTLE OR NO BENEFIT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NOVA. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CNN ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM -- SO FIRST OF ALL. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE MOST OF OUR MEMBERS HERE RIGHT NOW. THAT WE ATTEND THESE HEARINGS AND TO HEAR ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES. AND THIS IS SOMETHING WHEN YOU MENTION THE LOOPHOLE I WANTED TO CHECK ON THIS AND I'VE CHECKED WITH STAFF AND IT IS TRUE. THAT IF YOU WERE DRUNK AND YOU HIT SOMEONE. AND YOU STAY YOU CAN GET FOUR YEARS OR MORE. WORDS IF YOU LEAVE AND THEN YOU'RE NOT TESTED. AND YOU COME BACK AT YEAH THEY FIND YOU A DAY LATER THEY THEY CERTAINLY WHAT THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CONVICT YOU FOR DRUNK DRIVING FAIR FOR YOU TO GET LESS THE SENTENCE. BECAUSE I FOUND THIS OUT RIGHT NOW AT THE HEARING. I'M. I'M NOT PREPARED TO VOTE YES I'M NOT PREPARED TO VOTE NO. I THINK WE NEED SOME TIME ON THIS. OF FOR YOU IN THE CHAIR TO CONFER. OF THE ALTERNATIVES FRANKLY I I WOULDN'T GO FORWARD WITH THE BILL RIGHT NOW I'D BE AND NOT VOTING AND THAT'S THE SAME AS OF NOW. BUT WHAT I'D LIKE IS FOR YOU IN THE CHAIR TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN BRING IT BACK. AND DECIDE ON THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT JUST FINDING THIS OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE I AM. I'M REALLY NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE A DECISION RIGHT NOW. MISS POWER CARE. THANK YOU MRS LEADING FOR COMING. FROM AS A MOTHER. OF YOUNG KIDS AS WELL I CAN'T IMAGINE THE PAIN THAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS AND I SO APPRECIATE YOU COMING AND SHARING YOUR HUSBAND STORY. THANK YOU -- SO I BELIEVE I THINK BOTH OF YOU HAVE IMPORTANT POINTS TO RAISE THEIR AGREE JUST CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THE ONES DESCRIBED HERE WERE EIGHT YEARS IS ABSOLUTELY PERHAPS WITH THE JUDGE IN THIS SEARCH ATTORNEY WOULD FIND APPROPRIATE AND WE SHOULD. CONSIDER RAISING THE PENALTY IN THAT CASE I ALSO HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. NOT EVERY CASE IN THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM IS THE SAME RIGHT AND THEY'RE SITUATIONS THAT ARE LESS EGREGIOUS THAN THE ONE PRESENTED HERE TODAY. AND IN THOSECASES MAYBE TWO YEARS IS APPROPRIATE. SO I AM. IN A PLACE WHERE I SEE THE MAYBE THERE IS AN IN BETWEEN WHICH IS TO KEEP THE FLOOR IT TWO YEARS BUT TO RAISE IT TO EIGHT YEARS AS A TOP PENALTY AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'D BE OPEN TO MR PATERSON BUT I'M -- YOU KNOW I'M SORT OF WITH MISTER QUIRK RIGHT NOW WHERE THAT SOMETHING I WOULD ACTUALLY CONSIDER BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE CASES. LIKE MRS GLIDING'S WHERE EIGHT YEARS. IS RIGHT BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE DISCRETION AWAY FROM THOSE IN THE SYSTEM TO USED HERE'S WHERE THE CASE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE DESCRIBED SO. I PUT THAT TO YOU [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. SO I AM. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING AND SHARING YOUR STORY AND FOR BRINGING -- HIS RELATIVES AND HIS FRIENDS AND PEOPLE WHO LOVE THEM. TO KEEP HIS MEMORY AND KEEP HIS LIFE ALIVE I AM [inaudible] IT IS. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE -- AND YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT PERSON WHO KILLED YOUR HUSBAND HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY DECENCY. AND TO RUN AND THEN TRIED TO COVER IT UP. WHATEVER COURAGE HE MAY HAVE HAD. WAS DEPLETED. IN THAT INSTANCE. AND LIKE MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES I TO HAVE SOME CONCERNS I HAVE CONCERNS WITH WHEN WE TRY TO ENHANCE PUNISHMENTS [inaudible] NOT. UNDERSTANDING THAT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO OTHER KINDS OF FOLKS HAPPEN IN THE PENDULUM BEGINS TO SWING OTHER WAYS IN WAYS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT OTHER FOLKS. WHO WHO HAVE DIFFERENT STORIES LIKE SOME OF THE STORIES THAT WERE SHARED -- BY -- THE WOMEN HERE I I THINK THAT -- JUDGES DO HAVE DISCRETION. AND THEY HAVE MULTIPLE TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL WITH THE LAW TO STACK SENTENCES ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER TO TRY TO GET THE KIND OF PUNISHMENT. FOLKS FEEL -- IS WORTHY -- FOR THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THOSE KINDS OF CRIMES AND I THINK HIT AND RUNS ARE. ALSO VERY CHALLENGING BECAUSE THEY ARE. LEFT OPEN TO INTERPRETATION BY BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BY PROSECUTORS. SOME WILL INTERPRET GOING THREE BLOCKS VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM GOING FIVE MILES VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM GOING HOME AND TRYING TO YOU KNOW FIX UP A BANGED UP CAR. AND SO HOW WE RECTIFY SOME OF THOSE NUANCES -- THAT CAN ONCE AGAIN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT CERTAIN FOLKS WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN HIT BY THE SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE HAVE PUT FORTH OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEARS. IS SOMETHING THAT AS A MEMBER OF THIS POLICY BODY I AM VERY INTERESTED IN TRYING TO CORRECT WITH A MUCH MORE LASER FOCUS THEN BROUGHT ENHANCEMENTS SO I AM IN AGREEMENT WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT I WOULD BE OPEN TO SOME KIND OF AMENDMENTS BEING BROUGHT FORTH AN ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS. TO BE HAD AROUND THIS BILL BEFORE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ACCOMMODATE OF MR LACKEY [inaudible] THANK YOU. I GUESS I'M A BIT CONFUSED BY THE BY THE NUANCE THAT SEEMS TO BE CREATED HERE THIS IS VERY CLEAR CUT. THIS IS A HUGE INJUSTICE. AND ME JUST TELL YOU THAT -- I HAVE PERSONALLY. NOT ONLY WITNESS BUT BEEN INVOLVED WITH. INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER FAMILIES THAT HAVE DEALT WITH THIS TYPE OF TRAGEDY [inaudible] AND YOU KNOW THE THE DEFENSE TALKED ABOUT [inaudible] LEGISLATIVE INTENT. AND THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF LEGISLATION. AND I WOULD CHALLENGE THIS COMMITTEE AND EVERYBODY ASSIGNED TO THIS COMMITTEE. TO THINK ABOUT LEGISLATIVE INTENT. AND ARE WE HERE. TO ALLOW FOR ACCOUNTABILITY TO BE CARRIED OUT. OR WE HEAR TO ALWAYS SYMPATHIZED WITH THE FENDERS. IT GETS VERY VERY TIRESOME. AND I'D I DON'T SAY THAT IT'S NOT NORMAL TO BE SYMPATHETIC. BUT WHEN YOU. HAVE SOMEBODY THE EXPERIENCE THE TRAGEDY ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH NEEDLESS DEATH. CHANGES THE PICTURE. I WOULD HOPE. CERTAINLY DID FOR THE VICTIM IN ARGUABLE. AND UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT THESE VERY DELICATE ISSUES. VICTIMS ARE REALLY REALLY ARE FORGOTTEN. WITH WE TALK ABOUT VICTIMS' FAMILIES BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM. WHAT TO LOOK AT THE VICTIM THEY'RE GONNA [inaudible] THAT'S SHAMEFUL. THAT SHAMEFUL THE WE DISCOUNT. THE TRAGEDIES ASSOCIATED WITH LOSS OF LIFE. IN THIS I AM SO SORRY. THIS HAPPEN TO YOUR FAMILY. BUT WE COULD DO A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING THAT MEANS A GREAT DEAL. AND THAT IS. ADDRESS FUTURE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THIS AND JUSTICE WE WE CAN'T BE PROMOTING -- ENCOURAGING. PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE SCENE. WHAT'S SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE HAS JUST OCCURRED. BUT WE'RE AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THEIR LEGISLATIVE INTENT DESIRED THAT. WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND I I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE. PEOPLE PUT A LOT OF TRUST IN US ON THIS COMMITTEE. TO ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE LEGISLATION THAT MAKES OUR PUBLIC MORE SAFETY. SAFE THAT'S WHY WE'RE CALLED PUBLIC SAFETY. ONLY PASSED LEGISLATION THAT MAKES THEM LESS SAFE. WE'RE BETRAYING THAT TRUST. SO I WOULD HOPE IN THIS VERY VERY SENSITIVE VERY VERY DELICATE. ISSUE THAT WE WILL SHOW. THE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BETRAY THAT TRUST. AND WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS AND JUSTICE. IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND YOU PROVIDE AS A WAY TO DO THAT SO I'VE FULLY IN SUPPORT AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO BRING THIS FORWARD [inaudible] THE AND THE MISS WORK OF THANK YOU WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SHERMAN FIRSTLY I WANT TO THINK OF MY MY COLLEAGUE DR COURT FOR A OF ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE IS A LOOPHOLE IN OUR CURRENT PENAL CODE THAT. REALLY. ENCOURAGE PEOPLE -- TO TO TO AVOID A OF BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE -- AND AND I WANT TO THINK OF SOME WOMEN ARE PATTERSON FOR BRINGING THIS BILL -- FOR HI I THINK I WOULD JOIN -- MY VICE CHAIR IN A SUPPORTING THIS BILL -- SO THAT WE CAN. BRING BACK ON SOME SENSE OF JUSTICE OF FOR THOSE THAT WERE -- ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THIS CRIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THANK YOU AND MISS WORK THANK YOU -- ANOTHER FOR TWO YEAR OLD. AND MY HUSBAND MY FAMILY ARE EVERYTHING TO ME SO I COULD ONLY BENCH. AND I WON ALIGN MYSELF WITH MR QUIRK AND MISS BARRICADE HENIN'S COOPERATIVES COMMENTS. IN THAT -- I WOULD REQUEST THAT WE HAVE MORE TIME TO THINK SOME OF THE STUFF THROUGH. BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE PUNISHMENT MEETS THE CRIME BUT WE ALSO WANNA BE MINDFUL OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT SOME OF THIS LEGISLATION CAN HAVE AND I AM -- SOMEONE WHO IS -- CONCERNED ABOUT BLINK AT SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE SENATE AND CONSEQUENCES BUT I'M ALSO VERY SYMPATHETIC. TO SO I JUST WANNA LET MYSELF WITH [inaudible] THANK YOU. ON MISTER PATTERSON YOU MAY CLOSE. I'M A MEMBERS I AM MISTER CHAIR PRECIADO. VERY VERY MUCH THE CONVERSATION THAT HAS. TAKEN PLACE HERE. WE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED SOMETHING I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THERE IS A LOOPHOLE HERE. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THOSE WHO. SUGGESTED UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN ONE PARTICULAR DIRECTION. THERE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AS WELL. AND THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES MEAN THAT. IN A PERVERSE WAY. SOMEONE WHO PURPOSEFULLY FLEAS HIT AND RUN. FACES LESS PENALTY THAT IF THEY STAYED. AND WE CAN CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE. I UNDERSTAND THIS COMMITTEES. CONCERN OVER -- CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. AND I KNOW THAT THIS BILL DOES. FLY IN THE FACE A BIT OF THE THE THE PLACE WHERE I THINK THIS COMMITTEE. AS A MAJORITY. MOVES. BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE COMES SOME MOMENT. WHEN THE FAX IN FRONT OF US AND THE APPARENT [inaudible] AN OBVIOUS. CONSEQUENCES OF THIS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. REALLY REQUIRES US. TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH THIS [inaudible] AND I SO I I I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT. MISTER CHAIR I I AM GLAD TO WORK ON THIS. BUT I AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT SIR I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE. AND IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME THAT. I WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. ON OTHER BILLS. THAT NEVER TOOK PLACE. IS THERE A SERIOUS. COMMITMENT FROM THE CHAIR AND FROM THIS COMMITTEE. THAT WE WILL WORK ON CLOSING THIS LOOPHOLE. AND CAN WE WORK TOGETHER TO GET TO A YES. INSTEAD OF A NO. I AM WILLING TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER. TO WORK THROUGH THAT. I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN. PARTICIPATING IN FINDING THE LOOPHOLE UNDERSTANDING IT AND TRYING [inaudible] TO CLOSE IT -- SO I'M. IN A BIT OF A QUANDARY TO KNOW HOW WE PROCEED. THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT SAYS I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO VOTE IN FAVOR. AND IF THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND THEN LET'S TAKE A VOTE -- FAILING THAT I AM OPEN TO WHAT EVER KIND OF LEGITIMATE. TIMELY. EFFORT TO WORK THROUGH TO GET THE LOOPHOLE CLOSED. AND I WOULD ASK THAT THERE BE. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE CHAIR CAN INSTRUCT THE STAFF. BUT I WOULD ASK THAT. WE TRIED TO FIND A WAY TO SAY YES. INSTEAD OF SIMPLY DELAYING. UNTIL IT NO LONGER IS ELIGIBLE TO BE HEARD. I WOULD LIKE TO TRUST. BUT I NEED TO VERIFY. THANK YOU WITH ADAM I JUST WONDER MY JUST IN THE CLOSE. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE? IS TO CHANGE. THE PRESIDENT HIT AND RUN CULTURE [inaudible] AND IF WE HAD THIS LAW ON THE BOOKS AND IF WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE. THE INFORMATION THROUGH THE MEDIA AND OTHERS THAT IF YOU HIT RUN LEAVE. YOU'RE GOING TO PAY AS MUCH A PENALTY FORCE OR MORE THAN IF YOU STAY IN BE A HUMAN BEING. THIS IS A I THINK A VERY LOUD AND CLEAR DETERRENT. THAT IF THEY HIT HER KILL AND LEAVE. THAT THEY WILL FACE A PENALTY. THE OPPOSITION SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS AN ENHANCEMENT. WE ARGUE THAT THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN PUTTING PARITY IN. TO THIS LAW SO THAT LEAVING THE SCENE IS TREATED MUCH LIKE VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER. THE TICKET A MANSLAUGHTER CARRIES THE SIMILAR KINDS OF OF PENALTIES. WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS. IF IT SHOULD PASS THROUGH YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT. THAT WE WILL IN FACT WORK ON OTHER. A AMENDMENTS ARE OTHER WAYS. TO SETTLE OUT SOME OF THE CONCERN THAT TO YOU AND STAFF MIGHT HAVE. BUT LET'S FIRST START FROM A COMMITTEE COMMITMENT. TO GET TO A YES. INSTEAD OF A NO. THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT VOTE THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON AND YOU AND I HAVE -- OBVIOUSLY HAD DIFFERENCES ON VARIOUS BILLS -- OBVIOUSLY SOUNDS LIKE WE NEED TO IMPROVE. HOW WE WORK TOGETHER AND I I WILL ASSURE YOU? ON THIS BILL ESPECIALLY. WE WILL TRY TO WORK THROUGH SOME SOLUTION PROPOSITION AND MAYBE NEITHER SIDE LIKES BUT WILL COME TO SOLUTION. BUT BEFORE THAT I WHAT I WANTED TO TO MAKE SURE I SAID I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR SEVEN YEARS -- AND MRS SUSAN CLADDING. YOU ARE THE FIRST WITNESS. THAT EVER COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. THAT BASICALLY TURNED TO COMMITTEE THROUGH YOUR COMPASSIONATE EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY -- EVEN. THE CONSULTANT FOR PORAC. YOU BROUGHT HIM TO TEARS -- AND DOES NOT AN EASY TASK IF YOU KNOW RANDY -- YOU'VE GOTTEN SOME COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND IT TEARS. SO I'M LETTING YOU KNOW YOU. SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE SEVEN YEARS YOU'VE BEEN THE MOST POWERFUL. ADVOCATE FOR YOUR COST SPEAKER THAT WE'VE EVER HAD. AND I WILL TELL YOU YOU WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL. BECAUSE I'M PRETTY CERTAIN MISTER PATTERSON. WE WERE AT NO. TWO UNDECIDED FOR THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS HERE. AND WHAT I'M GOING TO PROPOSE AS A SOLUTION. SO THAT JUAN MEMBERS HOPEFULLY. THE LINE'S SPECIAL ONES LIKE MYSELF THERE WERE IT NO -- THAT WE GET TO A NO VOTE. AND WE GIVE YOU RECONSIDERATION. WANT TO GIVE YOU MORE TIME THAT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. EVEN LOWERED EXXON LIKE WERE TALKING THROUGH SOME OF YOUR SPEECH AND I HAD A QUIET THEM DOWN. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TO A SOLUTION HERE RIGHT NOW. ON THE COMMITTEE. AND WE JUST NEED MORE TIME. YOU HAVE MEMBERS HERE. REGARDLESS OF THE YOU'RE NOT OUR RELATIONSHIP OR HOW WE WORK TWO THINGS THEIR MEMBERS NOW ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT WANT TO WORK THROUGH A SOLUTION. WHICH IS MORE POWERFUL THAN MY ONE VOTE. AND AND THEY'RE THOROUGHLY COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT STAFF. WORK THROUGH A SOLUTION MISSION YOU HAVE MEMBERS THAT. I WILL SAY NOW BELIEVE YOUR MEMBERS THAT THE POINT YOU MADE ABOUT THIS BEING A LOOPHOLE. THEY GET IT. ANYONE A CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE ON TO DRUNK DRIVING [inaudible] FELONY -- ISSUE WHILE MAKING SURE. FOR ME. SOMEONE HAS A PREDOMINATE LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THAT MOSTLY HAS MAYBE A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY GET STOPPED IN MY DISTRICT ARE LATINO. WHO MAY NOT BE FULL CITIZENS WHO AFRAID AND TAKE OFF [inaudible] OR PEOPLE FORMING INCARCERATED. THAT TAKE OFF BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD BAD RUN INS. BUT THEY'RE NOT DRUNK. AND WE DON'T WANT TO GET THEM. ENTRAPPED ARE ENGINEERED. INTO SOMETHING THAT I I BELIEVE. AND I'M THAT THERE IS A SWEET SPOT SOMEWHERE. AND AND THAT. YOU CAN TAKE BACK TO NOT ONLY MRS GLIDING'S BALL HER FAMILY MEMBERS AND IS SPECIAL AND THE ONES THAT I CUT OFF. I I WOULDN'T CUTTING OFF TO BE MEANS JUST WE HAD LIMITED TIME. BUT MOST IMPORTANT. YOU HAD BEST SPEAKER RIGHT HERE. SPEAKING ON YOUR BEHALF SHE WAS GREAT. AND AFTER SHE SPOKE -- WE DIDN'T NEED ANYMORE. AND SELL OUT. I I WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IF WE WOULD NOT VOTE AND THAT WE WOULD GIVE YOU RECONSIDERATION. SO THAT WE CAN THEN NOT ONLY TALK ABOUT. TIME FOR US TO COME TO DIRECTORS UP TO WHEN HE COMES BACK WITH HIS BOOK TO VOTE ONLY WITH. HOPEFULLY THE AMENDMENTS. THAT EVERYBODY FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH I'D ANY DENTIST AND THE THE PROCESS HERE TO DO SO WE WE HAVE A IF IT DIES IN COMMITTEE DID YOU ASK TO RECONSIDER IT AND THEN THAT OPENS THE PROCESS FOR US TO YES HAVE THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS. M. I HAVE COMMITMENTS FROM. ALL THE MEMBERS HERE AND THE CHAIR TO GET THIS. TO WE'RE ALL GONNA WORK A CLOSER ACT AND LET'S NOT. TO ANOTHER TO ANOTHER LEVEL TRANSPARENCY. SO THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT. WHATEVER WILK SOLUTIONS THAT ARE COME UP EVERYBODY KNOWS ALL THE DIFFERENT. PERMUTATIONS THAT COME OUT TO THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND HAVING ALL SIDES IN TO TALK ABOUT IT. SO IT'S NOT JUST ME AND YOU TALK ABOUT OUR STAFF AND STAFF TALKING WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER METHODOLOGY THAT WE INCLUDE EVERY MEMBER HERE SO YOU CAN'T DO THAT. IF WE ARE JOINTLY WORKING ON THE LOOPHOLE YES WE WE DO HAVE AN AGREEMENT HERE WE HAVE A CONSENSUS THAT THERE IS IN FACT A PROBLEMATIC LOOPHOLE. IT DOES EXIST AND IT PERVERSE LEE OF REWARD. I'M SO I APPRECIATED -- IF YOU CALL THE QUESTION AND AND IT FAILED FAILS -- TO FAILED TO PASS I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION WHICH WILL BEGIN A PROCESS THAT YOU YOU IT WILL BE. AND I KNOW I HAVE TO MAKE. AND I KNOW THAT. THANK YOU SIR IT THAT'LL CLOSE. SO I PROBABLY NEED MY ROOF. PUBLIC IN COLLEAGUES TO SAY SOMETHING FIRST. COURSE OF THE MOVIE BILL -- YEAH.

BUT I KNOW WHERE YOUR HEARTS ARE YOU DEMONSTRATED THAT TODAY I'M VERY GRATEFUL AND I KNOW THE FAMILY IS. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. A SIGNATURE SHOE. I WANTED TO CHECK. IS THE VEHICLE MORE [inaudible] SHOP [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] ALTHOUGH [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] BOB. I'M READY. TO RUN. WHAT THE BOTH HERE? IT IT IT. MR CHOW I MISSED IT YOU ARE HERE HUNDRED ITEM NUMBER. ONE DESTRUCTIVE -- MUCH -- GOOD MORNING CHAIR TEN MEMBERS. AB THREE HUNDRED ENSURED THAT HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENCES IN CALIFORNIA. ARE ACCURATELY IDENTIFY REPORT AND INVESTIGATED. THE BILL REQUIRES THAT THE CRYING AND INCIDENT REPORT USED BY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. INCLUDE A CHECK BOX INDICATING WEATHERED THE CASE AT HAND IN A HATE CRIME OR HATE INCIDENT. IT ALSO REQUIRED THAT FOR EACH HATE CRIME OR HATE INCIDENT. THE AGENCY MUST COMPLETE A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT SUBSCRIBE TO FIND THAT TYPE OF BIAS MOTIVATION INVOLVED. AND OTHER IMPORTANT RELEVANT IN. IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE CASE. THE NEED FOR THIS BILL WAS -- RE ITERATED FROM THE ISSUE THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN HEY CRIME REPORT FONG CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. WHICH I WORK WITH OTHER MEMBERS AND CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS TO REQUEST. IN THE REPORT AN AUDIT ALL FOUR MAJOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. SHOWED THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HOUSE NOT ADEQUATELY IDENTIFY REPORTER. OR RESPONDED TO HATE CRIME. THE REPORT SUGGESTS START LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY UPDATE THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ON HATE CRYING AND IMPLEMENT. SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING. GOOD THE TIME TO DO DOES IS NOW BIG BECAUSE HATE CRIMES ARE ON THE RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE FORCE YEARS IN THE ROLE. ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR STUDY. OF HATE AND X. TRIM IS AN APP CALLED THE FINAL STATE UNIVERSITY SAN BERNARDINO. ACROSS ACCORDING TO THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL HEY CRYING. YOU BàN TO INCREASE SEVENTEEN POINT 4% FROM. TWENTY SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN THEREFORE ENSURING THAT HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENCES ARE ACCURATELY IDENTIFIED REPORTED. AND INVESTIGATE IT IS VITAL FORD IS NANCY A BILL. FROM THE ANTI DEFAMATION THAT THAT FILMATION'S LEAGUE. AND GREAT. DAY G. D. JEERS THANK YOU FROM THE ARC CALIFORNIA. GOOD MORNING I'M SORRY I HAVE MY BACK TO SOME OF YOU HOWEVER. MY NAME'S NANCY OF PELHAM CALIFORNIA OF LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE. WE SUBMITTED A SUPPORT LETTER FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- CHOOSE BILL AB THREE HUNDRED AND WE HAVE DEEP AND BROAD EXPERIENCE WITH HATE CRIME. AND IT'S DETAILED IN THAT LETTER SO I WON'T TAKE UP YOUR TIME NOW. CALIFORNIA AS WE KNOW HAS A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF HATE CRIME LAWS THAT TO MODEL FOR EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION. BUT LAWS ARE ONLY AS EFFECTIVE AS THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST SAID WE KNOW THROUGH NUMEROUS INDICIA THAT HATE CRIMES ARE NOTORIOUSLY UNDER REPORTED BOTH IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BY VICTIMS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEN BY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. YET EVEN THE DATA WE DO HAVE SHOW THAT HATE CRIME IS A GROWING PROBLEM IN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OF COURSE WE SAW A AYE POPPING SEVENTEEN POINT 4% INCREASE IN JUST AND REPORTED HATE CRIME. AND OF COURSE -- THE THE CS YOU ARE SAN BERNADINO CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM ALSO PREDICTS ANOTHER RISE. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NEVERTHELESS THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT ENTITLED HATE CRIMES IN CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS NOT ADEQUATELY IDENTIFIED REPORTED OR RESPONDED TO HATE CRIMES. BY ITS TITLE SUMS UP WELL HOW WE NEED TO DO MORE TO MAKE OUR HATE CRIME LAWS AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE. IN RELEVANT PART. THE AUDITOR RECOMMENDS THAT LAW ENFORCED SACRAMENTO REPORTS FOR REPORTED HATE CRIMES. SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS PLUS THE ADDITION OF THE CHECK BOX ON INITIAL REPORTS FOR SUSPECTED HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS AS DEFINED WILL HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS KEEP THE POSSIBILITY THAT. THE OF THAT AND EVENTS MAY BE BIASED MOTIVATED WHILE THEY'RE RESPONDING INITIALLY AND THEN FOLLOW UP. THIS WILL INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE HATE CRIMES AS THOROUGHLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS AS POSSIBLE FROM THE GET GO. THE INCLUSION OF A SUSPECTED HATE IS INCIDENT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT. THESE HATE INCIDENTS PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IMPACTING THE SAFETY OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. EIGHT INCIDENT IDENTIFYING HATE INCIDENTS AND TRACKING THEM CAN ALSO AID IN CRIME PREVENTION AS HATE INCIDENTS ARE FREQUENTLY THE PRECURSORS TO MORE SERIOUS HATE CRIMES. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY I HATE CRIMES ARE UNDER REPORTED. BUT LIKELY HIGH AMONG THEM IS A LACK OF SUFFICIENT AWARENESS OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT ONE HAS EVEN OCCURRED. BY ADDING THE CHECK BOX IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE POINTING TO IT. THANK YOU. GREG HERE WITH THE ARK IN UNITED TO RECALL THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION A COALITION OF PEOPLE WITH. INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES -- FRIENDS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH THIRTY SIX CHAPTERS AND AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- A HATE CRIME. AS A MATTER AS A IN A PRACTICAL MATTER DOESN'T EXIST UNTIL THE INITIAL RESPONDING PERFECT BY THE OFFICER SAYS IT DOES -- IF. THE OFFICER DOES NOT COLLECT THE THE EVIDENCE THERE IS NO CHANCE THAT THE HIGH RANKING PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OR THE DA WILL EVER PROSECUTED IS ALSO WILL NEVER. SHOW UP IN ANY OF THE STATISTICS. THIS IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF STATISTICS. IT'S A MATTER OF JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE OF THESE CRIMES. OUT WHILE ALL HE CRIMES UNDER REPORTED AND CONFIRM THAT WHAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN CALIFORNIA. ANTI DISABILITY HATE CRIMES ARE A PARTICULARLY AND REPORTED. THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY ESTIMATED THAT FROM TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE ARE AN AVERAGE OF FORTY THOUSAND AND I DISABILITY HATE CRIMES PER YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES. FORTY THOUSAND THIS WAS UNDOUBTEDLY AN UNDERESTIMATE BECAUSE THE SURVEY DID NOT COVER PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND HOSPITALS GROUP HOMES AND OTHER STUDENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE THIRD YEAR OF A OF A SURGE -- LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY REPORTED JUST ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN AND I DISABILITY HATE CRIMES THE FBI. LESS THAN 3% OF THE DOJ SERVICE ABOUT. FORTY FORTY THOUSAND ESTIMATED HUNDRED SIXTEEN REPORTED. THE IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT MOST RECENT YEAR WE HAVE STATISTICS. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORTED JUST. FOR FOUR AND I DISABILITY A CRIMES. THE BILL HAS TWO PARTS WHAT IS THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FORM WHICH IS THE THE ONLY WAY. THAT -- THAT HIGH RANKING OFFICERS INVESTIGATORS AND DA'S WILL EVER KNOW THAT THERE'S A HATE CRIME TO BE AS TO MENTION WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE AUDIT. THE OTHERS THE CHECK BOX WHICH WE KNOW WHAT WORKS WHEN THE LAPD ADDED THE CHECK BOX TO THEIR FORMS -- SOME YEARS AGO THE IT'S WHEN UP. WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NAME AN ORGANIZATION HELLO. HELLO MY NAME IS UNION OCCURS YES AND I'M WITH THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC RELATIONS CALIFORNIA THE NATION'S LARGEST AWESOME SO RIGHT GROUP. IN STRONG SUPPORT [inaudible] Q.. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M ERIN EVANS ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA SERVING THE STATE'S DIVERSE LGBT Q. POPULAR POPULATION. AND THEN PROUD SUPPORT OF AB THREE HUNDRED THANK YOU THANK. CHRISTINA GALLAGHER ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE HUNDRED THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING. COURSE ALSO HERE ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION -- HERE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT. THIS BILL AS A MECHANISM SOLVES WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE UNDER REPORTING OF HATE CRIME -- ALLEGE BUT IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THIS AS A MECHANISM ADDRESSES THAT ARE FIXES IT EXISTING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES REPORTING OF HATE CRIMES. THAT REPORTING INCLUDES THE NATURE OF THE BIAS INHERENT IN THE CRIME AS WELL AS VICTIM CHARACTERISTICS FENCE TYPE THE LOCATION OF THE OFFENSE THAT SORT OF INFORMATION. HAVING A CHECK BOX TO THE COVER REPORT -- AND REQUIRING -- SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING IT'S JUST LIKE IT IS IN NATURE IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE IN THE REPORTER IT'S NOT. IF IT IS THEN IT'LL BE AN COVERED AND IF IT'S NOT THEN WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S POTENTIALLY A PROBLEM WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. REASONS THAT WOULDN'T BE IN THE REPORT IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW THIS IS THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM -- THE WITNESSES SPOKE OF A INCREASE IN HATE CRIMES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WELL HOW DO WE KNOW THAT IF THIS THESE DATA ARE BEING REPORTED. THE DATA ARE BEING REPORTED IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT BENEFIT ADDING THE CHECK BOX IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS WILL ADD -- IF IT'S IN THE REPORT IT'LL BE THERE IF IT'S NOT IT WON'T HELP WITH THAT AND IF NOT IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH ASCERTAINING INFORMATION FROM THE REPORT. AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER BUT ADDING THIS DUPLICATIVE REQUIREMENT. TO IF YOU'VE ALREADY WRITTEN SOMETHING IN YOUR REPORT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE UP A PERCEIVED BIAS IN WHAT HAPPENED. THEN YOU'LL BE DUPLICATING THAT A SECOND REPORT AND CHECKING THE BOX SO AGAIN IT WE JUST DON'T SEE WHAT THIS REALLY SOLVES IT'S DUPLICATIVE IT'S GONNA TAKE RESOURCES. AWAY FROM OTHER THINGS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE POSTED CLICK THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISS COLORADO. THANK YOU SO I AM -- GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RESTATE THAT IT IS REALLY ABOUT REPORTING WE KNOW THAT HATE CRIMES JUST LIKE DOMESTIC TERRORISM. ARE ON THE RISE AND YET UNFORTUNATELY. IT IS INCREDIBLY HARD. THAT THERE'S MOTIVATION AND INTENT TO HARM A PROTECTED CLASS YOU KNOW AND PROSECUTORS DON'T WANT TO RUN THE RISK OF LOSING A CASE ARE LOSING ACCOUNT. BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE EDUCATION THAT HAS TO GO IN ON THE FRONT END IN TERMS OF EDUCATING JURORS ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW A PROTECTED CLASS IS. HOW YOU MEASURE INTENDS AND THEN WHAT THE APPROPRIATE CHARGE SHOULD BE? RIGHT SO MY HOPE IS THAT. IF WE ARE BEGINNING TO INTEGRATE THIS KIND OF REPORTING. THAT THAT WILL HELP WITH EDUCATION ON THE BACKEND FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BECOME BETTER AWARE ABOUT WHAT DOMESTIC TERRORISM LOOKS LIKE ABOUT WHAT THIS DOES NOT FOCUS ON THAT I KNOW I'M JUST ADDING A LITTLE EXTRA -- BUT ABOUT WHAT DOMESTIC TERRORISM LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT HATE CRIMES LOOK LIKE SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO ATTACK THE BIAS THAT'S IN OUR OWN JUDGMENT AS IT RELATES TO COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THESE KINDS OF PERPETRATORS. AND ALSO HOW WE BEGIN TO CHANGE THE LAWS AS IT RESULTS TO HOW WE EXACT APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN HATE CRIMES. BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE SHOULD BE AFRAID TO WALK. THE STREETS. BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE THEIR RELIGION THEIR HERITAGE THEIR COLOR THEIR GENDER THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AND BE AFRAID THAT IF SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN IT WILL NOT BE APPROPRIATELY REPORTED. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE AT THIS BAR QUE IN. THANK YOU. I HAVE MISTER TO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL ALL THE SUPPORTING AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW ALL ECHO. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COME LONGER DOES COMMENTS THAT WE KNOW HATE CRIMES ARE ON THE RISE AND THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN AS A BODY. TO CHANGE THAT AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS ARE BETTER DECISIONS AND SO THE ABILITY TO BETTER COLLECT THIS DATA THROUGH AN EASIER MECHANISM SEEMS LIKE A NO BRAINER TO ME. BUT I THINK THAT WE THEN NEED TO LOOK DOWN THE LINE TO KNOW THAT WE AS A BODY NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS. ARE THE SUBJECT OF THESE KIND OF CRIMES AND TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT STRUGGLE WITH THIS TYPE OF HATRED EVERY DAY ARE GETTING OUR ATTENTION AND WE'RE MAKING CALIFORNIA SAFER AND STRONGER. THANK YOU MISTER QUIRK SO. I HAVE SOME CIVIL LIBERTIES CONCERNS WITH YOUR BILL. I AM WORRIED THAT IF SOMEONE'S A MUSLIM. DEL AUTOMATICALLY CHECK HATE CRIME. AND SINCE WHEN DO WE BELIEVE THAT AN OFFICER OF THE LAW. IS JUDGE AND JURY I WOULD FEEL MUCH [inaudible] MORE. SYMPATHETIC IF YOU WOULD SAY SUSPECTED HATE CRIME. BUT TO SAY HATE CRIME UP FRONT -- BOTHERS ME -- BECAUSE THAT'S ASKING THE AN OFFICER TO MAKE A DECISION THAT'S BEST DONE BY JUDGE AND A JURY. I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WHAT THE STE SHARES BROUGHT UP. WHICH IS THAT. MR CELLS ELLA BROUGHT UP THAT THERE CAN BE DUPLICATION. THAT IF THE INFORMATION IS ALREADY IN THE REPORT WHY DO WE NEED TO WRITE IT DOWN AGAIN -- SO THOSE ARE TWO CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IF YOU OR YOUR EXPERTS COULD ADDRESS THE MIGHT APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. ANY YOU MAY CLOSE AND YOU CAN ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS IN YOUR CLOTHES BREAK THIRD THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- COLLEAGUES WILL FOR THE GOOD QUESTIONS DEFINITELY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ARE NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS. FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND SUPPORT WE ARE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE ATTORNEYS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND ALSO WORKING PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES. WE HAVE FOUND A LOOKING AT DRUG LAWS OVER THE LAST TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS IS THAT REALLY BEEN MULTI MULTIPLE LAYERS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN EXTENSIVE LITIGATION FIGHTING OVER. REALLY HOW OUR DRUG LAWS BE. IMPLEMENTED I WILL PREVAIL IN PARTICULAR. A VERY QUICK THAT IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE FOUND. IS THAT -- ROUTE THERE'S BEEN YOU KNOW STATUTES DEVELOPED. TO KIND OF FOCUS ON THE OUT LIAR CASES -- SPECIAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND DRUG POSSESSION OF DRUG TRAFFICKING OR TRANSPORTATION THERE'S BEEN THIS KIND OF IMAGERY OF CARTELS AND KIND OF THE KIND OF LARGE SUPPLIERS OF DRUGS. WHAT WE DON'T RECOGNIZE IN CALIFORNIA GET RECOGNIZED FOR A LOT OF YEARS IS THAT OUR LAWS ALSO APPLY TO THE VERY LOW LEVEL INDIVIDUAL WHO OFTENTIMES IS BOTH AN ADDICT AND A VERY SMALL SUPPLIER? YET OUR LAWS TREAT THESE INDIVIDUALS THE SAME -- JUST A FEW YEARS AGO IS HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE WHERE WE HAD TO CHANGE. AND SPECIFY THAT JOB TRANSPORTATION IS IN POSSESSION. OF DRUGS FOR PERSONAL USE BECAUSE THE WAY THAT STATUE WAS DRAFTED THE CAPTURED ANYBODY WAS MOVING WITH DRUGS IN THEIR POSSESSION -- THIS BILL ALSO ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE SEEN ON THE GROUND ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN COUNTIES RURAL COUNTIES. WHERE LOW LEVEL ADDICTS OR I'M SORRY ATTICS AND LOW LEVEL DRUG SUPPLIERS OR THE SAME INDIVIDUALS IS PART OF THE INDUSTRY THERE THAT? THEY ARE NOT THE LARGE SUPPLIERS THEY'RE NOT THE JUDGE LARGE DRUG TRAFFICKERS THEY ARE MORE SO ADDICTS WHO ARE. SUPPLYING THEIR HABIT IN TRYING TO FEED THEIR HABIT BY MAKING MONEY. WITH THIS BILL DOES IS ALLOW JUDGES TO LOOK AT THOSE CASES IN TREAT THOSE CASES IN THAT WAY. ABSENT THIS BILL THEY HAVE TO TREAT HIM AS IF THEY ARE LARGE TRAFFICKERS BECAUSE IS A MANDATORY MINIMUM. THIS BILL WOULD REMOVE THAT MANDATORY MINIMUM GIVE THE JUDGES THE DISCRETION TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT A MANDATORY OR INCARCERATION PERIOD SHOULD APPLY WE SHOULD NOT APPLY -- WHETHER DRUG TREATMENT EXTENSIVE PROBATION WILL BE MORE EFFECTIVE FOR THIS CASE. TO THE END OF THE DAY WITH THIS BILL DOES IS ENSURE THAT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS JUDGES CAN -- PARTICULAR ALLIES THE SENTENCE AND MAKE SURE THAT IN THIS CASE THE SENTENCE MAKE SENSE FOR THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL FOR THOSE REASONS WE ON SUPPORT THE BILL. MORNING MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS LIZZIE DID AND I'M WITH THE ACLU CALIFORNIA -- ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FORTY FOUR WAS STAND WITH THAT THE COMMENTS OF MISTER HERNANDEZ -- AND IN OF THE I'LL BE BRIEF IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE A JUDGE'S ABILITY TO IMPOSE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS GO AND OF INCARCERATION AS A CONDITION OF AN OF PROBATION IT MERELY ALLOWS THEM TO TAILOR. THE SENTENCE AND TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S RISKS AND NEEDS TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL CULPABILITY AND TO THE SEVERITY IN THE NATURE OF THE CRIME SO THIS WILL. MAKE THESE SANCTIONS MORE FAIR AND IT WILL IMPOSE -- ARE IT WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE IN SUPPORT [inaudible] BOTH YOU.
