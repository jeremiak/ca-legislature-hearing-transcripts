MEMBERS MY NAME'S ELAINE HOWELL IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. WITH ME TO MY RIGHT IS JOHN BEYER JOHN WAS THE AUDIT MANAGER ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND TO MY LEFT IS RALPH WHEN MISTER FLYNN WAS THE TEAM LEADER SUPERVISOR WORKING WITH STAFF. ARE AT THE STATE AGENCIES AND WE DID VISIT THREE LOCAL AGENCIES. I WILL GO OVER THE ISSUES IN A VERY HIGH LEVEL THAT I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MISTER FLYNN WHO WILL GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT THE THREE KEY ISSUES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT. AND THEN LAY OUT AGAIN IN A VERY HIGH LEVEL THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE BUYERS AVAILABLE WHEN WE GET INTO THE QUEUE IN A. ANNA AND WILL ASSIST IN ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE. SO FAR THIS AUDIT REPORT AND AS YOU INDICATED. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS ISSUED IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR I WAS REQUESTED BY MULTIPLE SENATORS LAST YEAR. APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE TOOK US ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS TO COMPLETE THE WORK AND WE HAD THREE KEY ISSUE AREAS. THAT WE IDENTIFIED OR DISCUSS IN THE AUDIT REPORT FIRST TWO ARE RELATED TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE THE FIRST AREA AGAIN MISTER FLYNN WILL GET INTO SPECIFICS BUT IT'S REALLY LOOKING AT THE FISCAL ASPECTS. OF. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND A LOOKING AT REVERSION PROCESS LOOKING AT UNSPENT FUNDS IDENTIFYING ON SPEND FUNDS A LOOKING AT INTEREST THAT HAS BEEN EARNED. AYE THE AMOUNTS IN RESERVE. AND CERTAINLY I ANY FUND BALANCES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND SO THAT FIRST KEY AREAS REALLY LOOKING AT THE FISCAL. ASPECTS OF THE OF THE AMOUNT HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS CURRENTLY OUT THERE THAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN SPENT. THE SECOND AREA IS LOOKING AT OVERSIGHT LOOKING AT WHAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS DOING TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FROM A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE. OF CONDUCTING AUDITS AND CERTAINLY FROM A PROGRAM PERSPECTIVE TO IDENTIFY THE POSITIVE IMPACT THAT HAS HAPPENED OUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS FAR AS OUTCOMES AND AND THE UP POSITIVE. ALL ASPECTS OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED BY THIS ACT SO MISTER FLYNN WILL GO INTO SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT REPORTS THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE FROM LOCALS. OUT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AS FAR AS PROVIDING ANY FISCAL OVERSIGHT AND CERTAINLY PROGRAM OVERSIGHT. AND THEN THE THIRD AREA IS THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. AND WHAT IT'S PROCESSES ARE WITH RESPECT TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT OFF CERTAINLY LOOKING AT SPECIFIC AREAS THEY HAVE A VERY. IMPORTANT ROLE WITH RESPECT TO INNOVATIVE PROJECTS AND APPROVAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THOSE PROJECTS FOR LOCAL ENTITIES. THEY ALSO LOOK AT. SOME ANNUAL REPORTS THAT THEY HAVE NOW REQUIRED LOCALS TO SUBMIT THAT REQUIREMENT WAS RECENT THEY REQUIRE THESE REPORTS TO. A COMMON AS RECENTLY AS DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. WE THINK THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS SOME PROCESS IS NOW TO ANALYZE THAT INFORMATION. OUGHT TO DETERMINE WHAT BENEFITS ARE AGAIN ARE OCCURRING OUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND IN THE LAST YEAR IS LOOKING AT TRIAGE GRANT THIS IS. A LEGISLATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE. APPROVED AND AND HAS BEEN ENACTED IN THIS IS TO PROVIDE EXPANSION OF SERVICES A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH PERSONNEL. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN EMERGENCY ROOMS JAILS HOMELESS SHELTERS AT SARAH SO THE THREE KEY ISSUE AREAS TO AND HEALTH CERTAIN HEALTH. CARE SERVICES ONE OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION LET MISTER FLYNN STEP THROUGH THOSE AND THEN HE CAN. LAY OUT WHAT THE KEY OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE THAT WE HAD BOTH FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. THANK YOU TO TELL A GOOD AFTERNOON. SHE CHAIRMAN IS RALPH ONE OF THE AUDITOR WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND I WAS THE TEAM LEAD ON THIS PROJECT. AS WITH ALL INDICATE WE FOUND TWO MAJOR CONCERNS WITH HEALTHCARE SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF THE EMERGENCY PROGRAM. OF THE FIRST WAS THE COUNTIES ARE SPENDING THE MONEY EFFECTIVELY THE SECOND REGARDING. OVERSIGHT ENSURING THAT THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT APPROPRIATELY. SO THE FIRST KEY ISSUE REGARDING. WAS THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS NOT DEVELOP A PROCESS TO RECOVER FUND UNSPENT ENERGY FUNDS ARE SUBJECT TO A VERSION. AS OF JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WE DON'T HAVE THAT THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION THAT WOULD SUBJECT TO REVERSION THAT COULD HAVE BEEN REALLOCATED TO OTHER COUNTIES. HAD HAD HEALTHCARE SERVICES ESTABLISH A REVERSION PROCESS. ALTHOUGH THE LEGISLATURE MADE A ONE TIME CHANGE IN ITS A LOT TO THOUSAND. THAT ALLOW THESE COUNTIES TO MEET TO KEEP THIS REVERTED DOLLARS WE HAD CONCERNS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HAS BEEN SLOW TO ESTABLISH A WRITTEN VERSION PROCESS. HEALTHCARE SERVICES INDICATED OF THAT IT NEEDED REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT A REVERSION PROCESS. FOR REVERSION AND FOR MANY OTHER. RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAD. AND OUR CONCERN WAS THAT HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAVE BEEN IN THIS ROLE OF OVERSIGHT SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. BOTTOM THE TIDE. ROUGHLY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ANNUAL FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THESE REGULATIONS THAT STILL IS NOT A INCLUDING THESE REGULATIONS. WE NEVER REALLY GOT A CLEAR EXPLANATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT REGARDING WHY THESE DELAYS ARE OCCURRING. HOWEVER DURING THE REPORT. ARE DURING THE AUDIT PROCESS THE FIRST INDICATED THAT THESE REGULATIONS WE ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THEN THEY WERE PUSHED OUT TO JUNE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND FINALLY WHEN THE REPORT WAS ISSUED. HEALTH CARE SERVICES INDICATED THAT WOULD NOT HAVE THESE REGULATIONS OUT UNTL. JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THIS CONTINUE SLIDING OF THE REGULATIONS GAVE US CONCERN AND PAUSE AND. AS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH AS THE REGULAR AT THE. RECOMMENDATIONS COME IN. ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN THAT WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WAS THE LEVEL OF AND WHICH IS A FUNDS OF THE COUNTIES ARE HOLDING A RESERVE. STATE LAW ALLOWS THE COUNTIES TO MAINTAIN A PRUDENT RESERVE. TO ENSURE THAT. FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES. HOWEVER AS OF JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE DON'T OF THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN HELD RESERVES TOLLING FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. WHICH IS A RESERVE OF ROUGHLY FORTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THESE PRE RESERVE DOLLARS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REVERSION AND THEREFORE THESE DOLLARS CAN STAY WITH THE COUNTIES. EFFECTIVELY INDEFINITELY. THE LAW DOES NOT SPECIFY A. A LOOK UP APPROPRIATE LEVEL FOR THE COUNTIES TO MAINTAIN FOR PRETTY RESERVE. AND DIE IN THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ONE. BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE TRENDS FOR. AND WE SAY FUNDS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WE IDENTIFIED AS APPROVING RESERVE LEVEL OF AT AT BATS ARE THE HIGHEST THIRTY THREE PERCENT. FOR PRIOR YEAR BEAUTY SERVICES VIOLENCE. NOW HAD COUNTIES IMPLEMENTED A RESERVE FUND OF THIRTY THREE PERCENT. WE NOTED THAT. THERE WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE FREED UP. NEARLY A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO PROMOTE AND EXPAND METAL SERVICES AT THE LOCALS. HEALTHCARE SERVICES DISAGREED WITH OUR FINDINGS AND BELIEVE THAT A RANGE OF BETWEEN SIXTY FOUR EIGHTY TWO PERCENT WOULD BE PRUDENT. WE DISAGREE WITH THAT AMOUNT AND FIND THAT IT'S EXCESSIVE WOULD JUST WILL. INCREASE WOULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR RENTAL SERVICES ALLOW ADDITIONAL FUNDS JUST GATHER DUST. FURTHER UNTIL OUR INQUIRY HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND NOT QUESTION. A REASON FOR NEARLY TWO AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION FUND BALANCE IN ITS IMAGE SAY FUND. AND WHETHER THE BALANCE REPRESENT FUNDS DUE TO LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES OR WAS A LONGSTANDING ACCOUNTING HERE. AS A RESULT OF OUR ENQUIRIES HEALTHCARE SERVICES IS NOT WORKING WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO DETERMINE. THE THE NATURE OF THIS FUND AND. WHAT IT STANDS FORM? OUR RECOMMENDATION FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOCUS ON FULFILLING WHAT IS FAILED TO DO SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMENDED THAT BY JUNE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN HEALTHCARE SERVICES. UP PROPOSED REGULATIONS FOR THE COUNTIES. GUIDANCE ON THE RIVERS ARE PROCESS. DESTRUCTIONS ON A HOW TO SPEND INTEREST THEY EARN ON AVERAGE THEY FUNDS. ESTABLISH AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL FOR RESERVE. AND THESE REGULATIONS WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH A PROCESS TO WITHHOLD FRONT FROM COUNTIES THAT FAILED TO SUBMIT THEIR ANNUAL EXPENSE REPORTS. A TIMELY. WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT THE DEPARTMENT BETTER OVERSEE COUNTIES PUBLISHING OF REGULATIONS IT WAS NECESSARY. A. FOR FISCAL AUDIT PROCESS. SO BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE DEPARTMENT ESTABLISHED A FISCAL AUDIT PROCESS FOR IMAGES SAY. HOWEVER IT TIED THIS TO ITS MEDI CAL REVIEWERS. AND WE DETERMINED THAT THESE MEDICAL REVIEWS ARE NEARLY SEVENTY EIGHT YEARS IN ARREARS. SO THEY'RE LOOKING BACK AT EVENTUALLY DOLLARS NEARLY SEVEN TO EIGHT YEARS AGO W. W. THAT PROVIDER CONTEMPORANEOUSLY REVIEW OF HOW THE IMAGE THE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT. WE ALSO WILL I THOUGHT THE BILL THEY ALSO DISCUSSED ESTABLISHING YOUR PROGRAM VIEW REVIEW PROCESS. AND THEY'VE INDICATED THAT THEY WERE ESTABLISHED THAT. SOON. REGARD THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION WE FOUND THAT HAS BEEN MORE PROACTIVE. THERE FOR OVER A REPORTS FINDINGS GENERALLY FOCUS ON THE COMMISSION A FINISHING EFFORTS THAT IT ALREADY IS. HAS UNDER WAY. FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE STRUGGLED SUSPEND THEIR INNOVATION FUNDS HAD A TIMELY MANNER. OF THAT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY WE'RE TORRENT AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ALTHOUGH SOME FREE VERSION. NEARLY HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS AN INNOVATION FUNDS. IT'S REALLY REPRESENTING SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF THE RIVER THE FUNDS. NOW THE COUNTIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THERE HAVE STRUGGLING TO DETERMINE WHAT ACT ACTUALLY IS AN INNOVATIVE FUND THAT COULD GET APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION. AND THE COMMISSION INDICATED TO US THAT WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES. OF THAT THEY'RE DOING OUTREACH TO THESE COUNTIES AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WOULD REPRESENT AN INNOVATIVE PROJECT AND TO HELP THESE COUNTIES GET INNOVATIVE PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE APPROVED. AND EFFECTIVE AND MEET THE THE REQUIREMENTS TO EXPAND A PROMOTE INNOVATIVE AND NEW TECHNIQUES TO. FOR METAL SERVICES. THE COMMISSION WAS AWARE OF THIS AND THEREFORE WE RECOMMENDED THAT THEY CONTINUE ON WITH THESE EFFORTS. I AM ALSO IS MICHELLE INDICATED THE OVER THE COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRIAGE GRANTS. AND WE SAW THAT THEY'RE DOING A GOOD PROCESS OF ALLOCATING THE GRANTS TO THE LOCALS. AND ALSO ESTABLISHING AT A LOCAL LEVEL A PROCESS TO EVALUATE IF THESE TRIAGE GRANTS ARE MEETING THE THE GOALS. HOWEVER THEY HAVE NOT ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE METRIC TO EVALUATE WHETHER NOT. THESE GRANTS ARE MEETING THEIR GOALS. AND WE RECOMMENDED THAT THEY ESTABLISH ONE AND THOSE ARE COMMISSION AGREED TO THAT. FINALLY WE ALSO VISITED A THREE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES THE ALAMEDA COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES. A REVIEW FOUND THAT THESE COUNTIES WORK COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AMATEUR SAY. I SPECIFICALLY FIND THE THREE COUNTIES WERE USING THEIR THREE YEAR PLANS TO ALLOCATE THE IMAGE SAY FUNDS. AND THEIR GENERAL USING EFFECTIVE MONITORING PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS BEING SPENT APPROPRIATELY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE THREE YEAR PROGRAM PLAN. US WITH ALL OF OUR AUDITS WE FOLLOW UP WITH THE LOCAL AGENCIES EVERY SIX DAYS SIX MONTH AND ONE YEAR. AND THE SIXTY DAY RESPONSE FROM THE BILL OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS DUE BY THE END OF THIS MONTH. SO WE SHOULD HAVE OUR FIRST RESPONSE TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WANTED TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CENTER BELL WHO WAS THE REQUESTER OF THIS AUDIT TO. BE HAVE ANY. OPENING REMARKS. NOT TOO MUCH BECAUSE I WAS LATE AND THEREFORE DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE A LONG OPENING REMARKS OF. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. COMPLETING THEIR ADEN. WE WILL USE THE AUDIT IN TERMS OF LEGISLATION AND THEN. THE BUDGET IN THE UPCOMING. DELIBERATIONS OF THE STATE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY SO. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTISTIC KIND OF. YOU KNOW GIVE US. A LOOK SEE. AND AND AREAS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. AND THE MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES FOR THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS IS USES THESE ARE THINGS WE KNOW THAT WE NECESSARILY. HAVE TO. FOCUS ON TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS OF THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR WE SHARE IT. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE THERE QUESTIONS FROM. THE COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS. SEEING NONE I. DID YOU WANT OKAY ARE. OKAY AT BY DAVE IT IF IF THERE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTION WILL STAY FOR THE ENTIRE HEARING AFTER THE OTHER PANELS. A BIT OF MEMBERS AT HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AFTER YOU HEAR FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND NOW CERTAINLY FROM THE STATE. REPRESENTATIVES WOULD BE HAPPY TO COME BACK UP OKAY THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO CALL UP OUR NEXT PANEL WHICH IS. TO HEAR FROM. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE HAVE MIMI MARTINEZ MCKAY THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. ANGELA INGGRIS WELL I SHOULD I SHOULD LEAVE EVERYONE. TWO INTRODUCED THEMSELVES WE HAVE REPRESENT US FROM LA COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY SACRAMENTO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE. WELCOME EVERYONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WE START WHAT LOGISTIC APPEAR. THE. THAT THE PUBLIC AGENDA SO A LOS ANGELES COUNTY. GOOD AFTERNOON SIR MY NAME IS MAYBE MARTINEZ MCKAY. I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES A POSITION I'VE HELD NOW FOR EIGHT MONTHS. AND I'LL SAY THAT THEY NON NATIVE LOS ANGELES AND I SPENT THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS AS THEIR. CHIEF OF STAFF OF LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE OF TEXAS MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND IN THAT POSITION IN TEXAS WHEN I SAW THIS PROPOSITION PASSED IN MY HOME STATE AND SAW THE HOPE AND THE VISION BEHIND IT. YOU'D HAVE TO SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FROM OUTSIDE RIGHT IT WAS LIKE OH MY GOODNESS I MEAN JUST HOPING THAT. A MOVEMENT OF THAT KIND WOULD CONTINUE IN OTHER STATES AND. ITS ATTENTION FROM HEARINGS LIKE THIS BUT I THINK WOULD BRING THAT ABOUT LOOKING AT THE VISION LOOKING AT WHERE THINGS NEED TO BE CORRECTED POSSIBLY. AND THEN MOVING FORWARD SO IT'S JUST REALLY EXCITING TO BE HERE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PANEL INTO THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. FOR PRODUCING THIS REPORT SO WE'LL START WITH A FEW COMMENTS ON THE REPORT ITSELF IN BRIEF OUR PERSPECTIVE ON IT WHEN IT WAS RELEASED. LA COUNTY SUPPORTS THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. OF THE REPORT AND WELCOMES ROBUST STATE LEADERSHIP AROUND ALL IMAGES SAY PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. OUR PROCESS AROUND IMAGES EXPENDITURES IN LA COUNTY IS TRANSPARENT AND WE HAVE DETAILED SPENDING PLANS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE. SO YOU KNOW WE THAT IS SOMETHING I OVERSEE WEB SERVICES AND WE ARE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT EVERYTHING OFF AND LOOK FOR ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ON EVERYTHING THAT WE. ALL OF OUR PLANS AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO OUR SPEND OUR SPENDING AND I. HAD OUR FOCUS ON EXPENDITURES. WE ARE KEENLY FOLKS ON DRESSING THE AREAS OF CONCERN IN OUR COUNTY WITH THESE FUNDS INCLUDING HOMELESSNESS OCCUR INCREASING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SERVICES VETERANS SERVICES. CRISIS SERVICES PREVENTION AND SAFETY IN OUR SCHOOLS. WERE VERY COMMITTED OUTCOME TRACKING EXTERNAL EVALUATION AND BEST PRACTICES TO GUIDE THE USE OF ALL PUBLIC FUNDS. INNOVATION OF COURSE IS A BIG FOCUS AND WE'RE CREATING PARTNERSHIPS ANALYTIC LIMITING SILOS BETWEEN D. MH AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS ON BEHALF OF ALL LA RESIDENTS. LOOKING TO EXPAND PROGRAMS THROUGH OUR PARKS AND LIBRARIES ADDRESSING HEALTH EQUITY AND TRAUMA AND PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES. AND THEN OVER THE PAST YEAR AND THIS IS SOMETHING I PERSONALLY BEEN VARYING GEISHAS WE'VE HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE COUNTY FOCUS ON CREATING PARTNERSHIPS WITH GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND AND AND BROADENING THAT CIRCLE YOU KNOWS A LOT OF TIMES YOU FIND YOURSELF IN ROOMS ARE SURE YOU'LL NEVER EXPERIENCE THIS WHERE IT'S A LOT OF THE SAME FACES YOU KNOW AND WE HAVE TEN MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTY. SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO BROADEN THAT DIALOGUES ARE BRINGING MORE PEOPLE INTO THIS EQUATION BECAUSE I HAVE YET TO FIND A FAMILY THAT IS NOT TOUCHED BY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. SO HOW DO ARE DOWN ON A COUPLE OF THESE AREAS SHORTLY BUT I ALSO WANT TO STRESS THAT THE COUNTIES THE OIC AND THE STATE AND IN OUR MIND NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A SEAMLESS SYSTEM. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE STATE SPEECH HIEF ROLE OF DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS THE OIC CREATING LINKAGES IN AFRICA. EVALUATING EFFECTIVENESS AND THE COUNTIES PROVIDING EFFECTIVE SERVICES. THAT SAME BROAD STROKES ALL OF THAT IS OCCURRING BUT. THERE ARE ISSUES AND SYSTEMS THAT ARE CREATING BARRIERS AT ALL LEVELS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REPORT. SHOW HOW SOME OF THAT ALIGNMENT HAS BEEN LACKING AND THE WE ARE AND ALWAYS GROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. AND FOR A COUNTY PERSPECTIVE. IF WE LOOK AT THE STATE WE LOOK AT THE STATE WIDE ENTITIES TO HELP US FOSTER AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE OUR CLIENTS. DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WORK PROGRAMS WILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES THEY NEED AND EVEN MORE DAUNTING WHAT FUNDING STREAMS WILL PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. BUT EVERYDAY I TALK TO CLIENTS AND FAMILIES AND THEY HAVE HAD TO LEARN THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF ALL OF THE ACRONYMS IN TERMS OF WHICH FUNDS IN TERMS OF WHAT PROGRAMS. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO BECOME HEALTHY. AND NOT SEEK WE SEEM TO HAVE PUT THEM INTO A SYSTEM WHERE THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. THE BUREAUCRACY SOMETIMES TO GET THOSE SERVICES AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT. SO WE'RE ONLY TO DO A BETTER JOB I THINK THE COUNTIES NEED TO LOOK TO THE STATE TO STREAMLINE PROPHECIES PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF REGULATIONS AND ESTABLISH POLICIES THAT CREATE A STRUCTURE. THAT SUPPORTS EFFECTIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE USE OF FUNDS. WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK TO THE OIC TO SUPPORT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATION AND MODELS OF EXCELLENCE WHICH QUITE RECENTLY LA COUNTY HAS. I HAD A REALLY POSITIVE EXPERIENCEIN TERMS OF INNOVATION THAT WE HAVE WORKED WITH A KEY PARTNERS KERN COUNTY BUT OTHER COUNTIES AS WELL. TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATION SWEET WHICH WERE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SO WE'VE SEEN THAT REALIZED VERY CLOSELY IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LA CITY. AND IN A MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE TO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE SERVE ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS SUPERVISORS THAT PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND NOT HAVE TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THESE INTRICACIES. SO I'D SAY FINALLY IN TERMS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE WOULD LOOK TO. THE FUNDS NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE TO ADDRESS DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD. AND FUN THINGS. THAT THAT ARE BENT AND FUNDS BEYOND THOSE THAT ARE MARKED FOR INNOVATION HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT INNOVATIONS WE NEED TO ADDRESS PRESSING NEEDS SUCH AS IN OUR CARE IN OUR COUNTY HOMELESSNESS. YOU KNOW NOT THAT WERE ONLY ALLOWED IN THAT BUT AS EVERYONE KNOWS MENTALLY COUNTY HAS A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE THEIR AND OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IS VERY FOCUSED BACK ON THAT. WE ALSO NEED TO BE A LITTLE STATEWIDE STORY AND WERE WERE WERE AN ENORMOUS COUNTY BUT WE NEED TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF THE OTHER COUNTIES TO TELL A STORY ABOUT HOW THESE. IF YOU KNOW THE VISION OF WHAT WAS BEHIND THIS PROPOSITION AND HOW WE NEED TO BE. LOOKING AT MESSAGES THAT THAT BETTER COMING FROM ALL OF THE COUNTIES AND WORKING TOGETHER. EVALUATION NEEDS TO BE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AND YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE RAND REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THE LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT LA COUNTY. AND HOW WE'RE REACHING THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THROUGH FIELDS FULL FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AND PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION FUNDING. THAT WAS THE FIRST EXTERNAL EVALUATION THAT WAS DONE RELATED TO THESE FUNDS AND SO WE NEED A LOT MORE OF THAT WE SUPPORT THAT AND WE SUPPORT THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH OF COURSE ARE AMAZING UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE. AND WE ALSO NEED THAT BETTER ALIGNMENT OF PROGRAMS THE AT WITH THAT ARE. LOOKING AT BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA SO WE'RE LISTENING TO PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT DATA TO IMPROVE A SYSTEM. BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEED TO BE IS THAT NEEDS TO BE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN COMPARISON TO THE TORMENT. TREMENDOUS WORK THAT IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED OVER THE LAST LAST FOURTEEN YEARS BUT THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK TO COME SO WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT AND WE GO WHERE. AS I SAID BEFORE I COME FROM SOMEWHERE WHERE THIS PROPOSITION WAS A BEACON OF HOPE FOR THE COUNTRY AND I THINK IT IS FOR THE WORLD AS WELL. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I NEXT SO WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM. ANGELA THE A BRISSON ASSISTANT DIRECTOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. THINK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON OF THANK YOU TO SENATOR PELL AND THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE FOR ORDERING THE CITED THANK YOU ALSO TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S FOR THE. EXCELLENT WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE. RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAD NO AUDIT FINDINGS AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO REPORT THAT. OVER OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN FOR EXPENDITURES WAS APPROPRIATE INCLUDED A PLAN FOR HOW UTILIZED A RESERVE INTERESTS WE APPROPRIATELY MONITOR PROJECTS AND VENDOR INVOICES SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THAT BEFORE YOU TODAY. SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE BEAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT TO ME MIMI DID A GREAT JOB OF EXPLAINING HOW THIS ACT HAS TRANSFORMED THE LIVES OF SO MANY PEOPLE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. THERE'S COUNTLESS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTY WHO HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY THE SERVICES WITHIN THIS ACT. MORE SPECIFICALLY LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW PROGRAMS ONE FROM EACH OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE ACTOR AT LEAST THAT SERVICE COMPONENTS. THE FIRST FOR THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS AND SERVICES ARE MENTAL. ARE MULTI DIMENSIONAL TREATMENT. SORRY MULTI DIMENSIONAL. AND YOU HAVE TO PROGRAM OKAY. MY FIRST TIME TESTIFYING A LITTLE TONGUE TIED BUT THIS IS A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM IT SERVES YOUTH ON PROBATION. SIXTY PERCENT OF THE YOUTH ON PROBATION THAT WE SERVE ARE ACTUALLY OF LATINO DESCENT. AND WE'VE HAVE FOUND THAT THIS PROGRAM TREATS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AT A RATE OF A SIXTY PERCENT. DECREASE IN ARRESTS. EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT DECREASE IN SCHOOL SUSPENSIONS. AND A FIFTY PERCENT DECREASE IN HOSPITALIZATIONS SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE EFFORTS OF THIS DIRECTLY AS A RESULT OF THE ACT. SECONDLY FOR PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH OUR MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AND STIGMA REDUCTION CAMPAIGN. WILL WILL ARE ANALYTICS CONSISTS NOW SAY THAT EIGHTY ONE PERCENT OF ALL RIVERSIDE COUNTY RESIDENTS. KNOW ABOUT THE IT'S UP TO US SUICIDE PREVENTION CAMPAIGN IT GIVES ME GREAT HOPE TO KNOW THAT THE RESIDENTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. KNOW ABOUT SUICIDE PREVENTION AND HOW TO ACCESS HELP IF THEY NEED IT. OUR NETWORK OF CARE WEBSITE YIELDED OVER SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND VIEWS LAST YEAR. CELESTIAL DOT HAD LAID ARE IN OF ONE OF OUR INNOVATION PROGRAMS ARE COUNTY IS VERY WIDESPREAD COUNTY AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL KNOW THERE'S. ALL KINDS OF RURAL AND URBAN AREAS WE HAD VIRTUALLY NO TRANSITIONAL AGE YOU SERVICES SERVICES FOR YOUTH SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE. AS A RESULT OF OUR INNOVATIVE PROJECT WE'VE NOW BEEN ABLE TO OPEN UP THREE. VERY LARGE CENTERS TO SERVE TO YOUTH. THE COMPONENTS OF THE CENTERS INCLUDE. TREATMENT FOR FIRST EPISODE PSYCHOSIS. A SPECIALIZED IN UNIQUE TERRY PEER EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAM. S. PROGRAM ESPECIALLY TAILORED FOR PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCES BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIXTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE. AND A COMPREHENSIVE ONE STOP SHOP FOR ALL YOUTH. SO WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE ACT. IN TERMS OF CHALLENGES. WE HAVE WORK TODAY AS IT RELATES TO THIS AUDIT WE'RE GOING TO HIGHLIGHT I'M GOING TO HIGHLIGHT TWO MAJOR CHALLENGES. THE FIRST ONE IS. INCONSISTENT MESSAGES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES REGARDING THE RESERVE FORMULAS. HOW TO ACCESS THE RESERVES WHEN NEEDED AND WHAT TO DO WITH ANY INTEREST ACCUMULATED? WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES OVER CONFIDENT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDIT. SECONDLY LIKE TO EXPRESS THAT IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE INNOVATIONS. FUNDING. LAST NOVEMBER. OF OUR COUNTY AND I WAS ACTUALLY THERE PRESENTED IN FRONT OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION REGARDING A HOSPITAL INTERVENTION PROGRAM. THIS OF PROJECT WAS A JOINT PROJECT WITH SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY WHO IS VERY LARGE OUR STAFF WORKED VERY LONG ON THIS PROJECT. OUR STAFF MET WITH THE STAFF OF THE OAC NO LESS THAN THREE TIMES DURING EACH ONE OF THESE MEETINGS WE WERE ASSURED THAT OUR PROJECT WAS INNOVATIVE. THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH ALL THE VALUES AND TERMS OF THE ACT. WE WERE SURE THAT ONCE WE GOT THERE THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION TO BE VERY EXCITED HERE WE HAVE SAY. WE'RE VERY SURPRISED FIND OUT WHEN WE GOT THERE THAT WE WERE PRETTY MUCH CATEGORICALLY DENIED. WE WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING OUR PROPOSAL BACK AGAIN. BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE ARE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME ON THIS THERE IS A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. THERE'S WRITING THE ACT THERE'S MEANING WITH THE OIC WE HAVE TO GET BOARD OF SUPERVISOR APPROVAL AND WE HAVE TO GET ON THE CALENDAR FOR THE OAC SO ALL THIS TIME GOES BY NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS. TAKING AWAY OUR MONIES ARE SUBJECT TO REVERSION SO WE WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE SOME ASSISTANCE IN GETTING SOME CLEAR GUIDANCE ON WHAT IS INNOVATIVE. WHAT ARE THE TIME LINES HOW CAN WE GET ON THE COUNTER FOR THE OAC? SO IN SUMMARY RIVERSIDE COUNTY FULLY SUPPORTS THE FINDINGS OF THE AUDIT. THE HIGHLIGHT. WE RECOMMEND IMPLEMENTING STATUTORY LIMITS ON RESERVE AMOUNTS CLEAR IN QUICK GUIDANCE FROM THE OAC ON INNOVATION PLANS CLEAR DIRECTION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES A RESERVE ALLOCATIONS. AND FINALLY. WE WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE AUTHORS OF THE ACT WHO HAVE SUCCEEDED IN REDUCING THE SUFFERING SIGNIFICANTLY OF OUR CITIZENS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT THAT LIKE TO INVITE THE. COUNTY SUPERVISOR PATRICK KENNEDY REPRESENTING THE STOCK MARKET ON PORTS SUPERVISORS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS PATRICK KENNEDY EMMA COUNTY SUPERVISOR IN SACRAMENTO REPRESENTING DISTRICT TO SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. FIRST LET ME THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIMEON YOUR AGENDA TODAY FOR ME. I'M REPRESENTING NOT ONLY SACRAMENTO COUNTY BUT ALSO THE YET CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES DE SAC WHICH IS A VOICE FOR ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THIS IN THE STATE. I ALSO HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE IN INSURING THE EFFECTIVE USE OF MHSAA FUNDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE. A PROTECT CRITICALLY MISTER BELL. WE AND THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT NEED TO KNOW HOW THIS CRITICAL REVENUES BEING SPENT TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. SEE SEC SUPPORTS THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE STATE AUDITOR AND THE AUDIT REPORT. LIKE THE MHSAA AUDIT THAT CAME BEFORE THIS ONE THE COUNTIES THAT PARTICIPATED ALAMEDA RIVERSIDE AND SAN DIEGO DID VERY WELL AND WERE FOUND TO HAVE COMPLIED WITH MHSAA LEGAL REQUIREMENTS REGARDING ALLOCATION OF THEIR IMAGES THAT AS A FUNDING. ONE POINT I MUST MAKE COUNTIES ARE NOT SITTING ON THREE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN MHSAA DOLLARS AS MENTIONED SO OFTEN. CAN WE DO BETTER YES. AB ONE FOURTEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR LAST LEGISLATIVE SESSION NOW GIVES COUNTIES THE GUIDANCE THEY NEED TO SPEND THE FUNDING. COUNTIES ARE ACTING QUICKLY IN MANY OF STARTED THEIR THIRTY DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS TO INVEST THESE DOLLARS NOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN FREED UP. WE WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR FOR CRAFTING AB ONE FOURTEEN TO PROVIDE BETTER OVERSIGHT OF IMAGE IT'S A FUNDING. AND TO ENSURE THE MONEY IS SPENT THE WAY AS ENVISIONED IN PROP SIXTY THREE. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE PLAN FOR MY COUNTY IN SACRAMENTO. OUR PLAN TO REPURPOSE FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN WHAT WAS CALLED I'M SPENT MHSAA FUNDING RECENTLY TO ASSIST WITH THE HOMELESS CRISIS. HAS BEEN POSTED SINCE FEBRUARY FIFTH THE MERE THIRTY SIX DAYS AFTER AB ONE FOURTEEN WENT INTO EFFECT. WE ASK FOR PUBLIC INPUT DEVELOPED A PLAN THAT WILL MAKE IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS IN CRISIS SERVICES ELDER WELLNESS AND HOMELESSNESS. AS A RESULT WE ARE MEETING TODAY'S NEEDS AND SPENDING FUNDS THAT WERE ONCE CONSIDERED ON SPENT. THE AUDIT RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW COUNTIES CAN FUND. CAN'T SPEND FUNDS ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE OAC PROCESS FOR APPROVING INNOVATION FUNDS. WE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION TO THE OAC THAT IT PROVIDE CLEAR GUIDANCE ON THE APPROVAL PROCESS IT EXPECTS FOR COUNTIES INVASIVE PLANTS. AFTER ALL SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF THE UNSPENT FOR THE CURRENT UNSPENT FUNDS. TO REVIEW THE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO REVERSION OUR INNOVATION FUNDS. WE ALSO APPLAUD THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION TO CREATE AN ACCEPTABLE MHSAA RESERVE LEVELS. COUNTIES ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WORKS AS A PRUDENT RESERVE SO THAT WE CAN RESPONSIBLY PLAN FOR THE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM. WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT NO COUNTY BUILDS UP AN UNREASONABLE LEVEL OF RESERVE. THE FOCUS IS CLEAR COUNTIES MUST USE MHSAA FUNDING TO MEET THE KEEP COMMUNITIES NEEDS. BUT TO DO THIS WE NEED THIS WE NEED THE STATE AND D. H. AT CS. TO GIVE COUNTIES CLEAR AND TIMELY REPORTING TOOLS. FOR EXAMPLE THE CORRECTED VERSION OF THE MHSAA. YEAR AND REPORTING FORM WAS RELEASED IN LATE JANUARY A MONTH PAST THE STATUTORY REPORTING DUE DATE OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN. COUNTIES TAKE THESE FORMS AND REPORTS VERY SERIOUSLY AS THEIR AUDITABLE AND MUST BE SIGNED UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. BY EACH COUNTY AUDITOR AND CONTROLLER. TO SUM UP MY COUNTY AND MY COUNTY SUPERVISOR COLLEAGUES AROUND THE STATE ARE WORKING TO ENSURE THAT MHSAA FUNDING IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE THE MENTAL HEALTH. OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SUPERVISOR I LAST BUT NOT LEAST FOR THIS PANEL BEFORE WE GO TO. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE IS. MAGGIE MARRIAGE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STEINBERG INSTEAD. HI NICE TO BE HERE I'D LIKE TO THANK. SENATOR BALLOT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI SENATOR ROTH AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. I MAYBE MERIT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE. WE ARE A NONPROFIT PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE DEDICATED TO ADVANCING FOUND PUBLIC POLICY AND INSPIRING LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUES OF BRAIN HEALTH. AS MOST OF YOU ARE AWARE OUR INSTITUTE WAS FOUNDED BY FORMER SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM DARRELL STEINBERG AND HE'S ARE YOU NOT ABLE TO BE HERE. AND SENDS HIS REGARDS. HE HAS BEEN A LEADING CHAMPION FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA AND WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. PART OF OUR MISSION AT THE INSTITUTE IS TO SERVE AS A STEWARD FOR THAT LEGACY. ENSURING THE FUNDS IT GENERATES FOR A STATE IS SPENT STRATEGICALLY EFFECTIVELY AND EQUITABLY. AS SUCH WE ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE RECENT AUDIT. AND GRATEFUL TO THE STATE AUDITOR FOR SHINING A LIGHT ON THE NEED FOR STRONGER STATE LEADERSHIP. WHEN IT COMES TO OUR MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM. FOURTEEN YEARS AFTER PASSAGE I FIND MYSELF THINKING THAT THE MHSAA IS IN MANY WAYS A TALE OF TWO CITIES. ON THE ONE HAND IT IS ARGUABLY ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S GREATEST PUBLIC POLICY ACHIEVE IT ACHIEVEMENTS. YOU REMEMBER IN THOSE DIFFICULT YEARS BEFORE PROP SIXTY THREE. THERE WAS NO CONTINUE I'M A MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO SPEAK UP. CALIFORNIA HAD EMPTIED OUT ITS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS WITH THE PROMISE OF BUILDING A FULL SPECTRUM OF COMPASSIONATE COMMUNITY BASED CARE. BUT OUR LEADERS NEVER FOLLOWED THROUGH ON THAT COMMITMENT. INSTEAD WE GOT BUDGET CUTS. WE HAD PEOPLE IN CRISIS AND KNOW WHERE TO TREAT THEM. OUR STREETS IN JAILS AND EMERGENCY ROOMS BECAME TREATMENT CENTER AS OF LAST RESORT. FAMILIES HAD NOWHERE TO TURN FOR HOPE. AGAINST THAT BACKDROP. THERE'S NO QUESTION THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT HAS BEEN A GAME CHANGER FOR CALIFORNIA. THIS YEAR ALONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR IT WILL GENERATE TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. THE SERVICES THAT HAVE FLOURISHED BECAUSE OF THIS FUNDING HAVE BEEN A LIFELINE FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. ACROSS THE STATE. SOME OF THE GREATEST GAINS HAVE BEEN AN AREA A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. THE INTENSIVE SERVICES TARGETING PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES HAVE FALLEN OFF TRACK BECAUSE OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. EIGHTY PERCENT OF MHSAA FUNDS ARE DIRECTED TO THESE PROGRAMS. MANY RECEIVING THE SERVICES ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS. OR HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT OF JAIL AND ARE IN AND OUT OF EMERGENCY ROOMS BECAUSE THEIR ILLNESS IS GONE AND TREATED. THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS PROVIDE HOUSING JOBS COUNSELING EDUCATION. MEDICATION DOES WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK. IT IS A DIFFICULT AND PAINSTAKING WORK. BUT IT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE. SINCE TWENTY TEN WE KNOW THAT MORE THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. ACROSS THE STATE HAVE I BENEFITTED FROM THESE SERVICES. A RECENT RAND REPORT FOUND THAT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE FS PIECE REACHED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE TREATMENT SIDE DRAMATIC DECLINES IN HOMELESSNESS AND DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY PERCENT OF MH AS A FUNDING JUST OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS DIRECTED TOWARD PREVENTION AND EARLY OTHER INTERVENTION AND HAS FUELED STATE OF THE ART PROGRAMS IN POCKETS ACROSS THE STATE THAT TARGET YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF MENTAL ILLNESS. TO HELP THEM GET CONTROL OF THEIR BRAIN ON THIS BEFORE IT BECOMES DISABLING. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WE HAVE THE EAT OUT PROGRAM DOING AMAZING WORK TO INTERVENE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF PSYCHOSIS RELATED ILLNESSES LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA AND BIPOLAR DISORDER. LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS DOING TREMENDOUS WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE GREAT RISK OF MENTAL ILLNESS BECAUSE OF THEIR EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA. THAT SAME RAND REPORT FOUND THAT THE COUNTY HAD REACHED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND AT RISK KIDS WITH THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND WITH GREAT SUCCESS. SENATE CLARA COUNTY IS LAUNCHING A PROGRAM CALLED HEADSPACE. A TERRIFIC PROGRAM OUT OF AUSTRALIA THAT PROVIDES LOW COST MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO PEOPLE AGES TWELVE TO TWENTY FIVE WITHOUT STIGMA OR RED TAPE. I SHARE THIS REMIND US ALL THAT WHILE THE AUDIT RAISES LEGITIMATE CRITICISMS ABOUT UNSPENT FUNDS. COUNTIES HAVE SPENT THE BULK OF THEIR MHSAA REVENUE OVER THE YEARS AND. THE STATE ABOUNDS WITH SUCCESS STORIES. WE'VE SEEN LIFESAVING TRANSFORMATION QUITE FRANKLY I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE WOULD BE TODAY WITHOUT THE MHSAA. BUT COULD IT BE HAVING EVEN BIGGER IMPACT. YES WE BELIEVE MHSAA SHOULD AND COULD. BE MAKING AN EVEN BIGGER DIFFERENCE. GIVEN THE FUNDS AVAILABLE AND CALIFORNIA'S PROMINENCE IN RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY WE BELIEVE THE MEASURE SHOULD BE DRIVING A SEISMIC SHIFT IN APPROACH AND OUTCOMES. THAT WOULD PROPEL US TO THE FOREFRONT OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN OUR NATION. UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT THERE YET. ARE HOMELESS NUMBERS CONTINUE TO RISE BECAUSE OF UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS. I SUICIDE RATES REMAIN UNCHANGED. SERVICES REMAIN FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE BACK END OF CARE ON PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS ARE HOSPITALIZED BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE ACCESS. I CARE ON THE FRONT END AT STAGE ONE. MORE THAN A DECADE AFTER PROP SIXTY THREES PASSAGE WE HAVE NO SYSTEM IN PLACE TO SET A STATE WIDE STRATEGIC VISION FOR MENTAL HEALTH SPENDING. WE HAVE NO SYSTEM FOR COMPARING IN SHARING OUTCOMES. WE HAVE. WE LACK THE CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THIS UNPRECEDENTED TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. IS SPENT STRATEGICALLY AND EFFECTIVELY ON SERVICES WITH MEASURABLE OUTCOMES. AND WE STILL HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES DOING THINGS FIFTY EIGHT WAYS. IN SHORT WE HAVE A FAILURE NOT OF FUNDING OR INTENT. BUT OF LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE. THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE SHORTCOMING. IT ECHOES THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE SERVICES AND TREATMENT. AND FINDS COUNTIES ARE DILIGENTLY TRYING TO CARRY OUT THEIR MISSION. BUT IT ALSO FINDS PROGRESS TOWARD THAT MISSION HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY INEFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT. WE AGREE WITHOUT FINDING FOURTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE MHSAA MENTAL ILLNESS REMAINS THE UNDER ATTENDED ISSUE OF OUR TIME. AND THE ONLY THING THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT IS STRONG AND CONSISTENT LEADERSHIP AT EVERY LEVEL OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS THE AUDIT NOTES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE GONE UNSPENT BECAUSE COUNTIES ARE UNCLEAR. ABOUT HOW TO SPEND THEIR PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION DOLLARS. ORDER WHAT CONSTITUTES A PRUDENT RESERVE. IN THE SHORT LIFESPAN OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT THIS IS THE FOURTH EVALUATION TO RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STATE'S FAILURE TO OVER SEED. AND DIRECT MHSAA SPENDING. THE TIME HAS COME TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT OUR LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND TO DEMAND BETTER. WE BELIEVE THAT TAKING OUR SYSTEM TAKE CARE. SORRY WE BELIEVE THAT TAKING OUR SYSTEM OF CARE TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF EXCELLENCE REQUIRES A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP APPROACH. WOULD CALIFORNIA BENEFIT FROM A STANDALONE MENTAL HEALTH AGENCY. I DEDICATED COMMISSIONER. IS IT SIMPLY A MATTER OF PUTTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE PEOPLE WITH A VISION AND PASSION FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE. IN THE EXISTING SLOTS. OUR INSTITUTE HAS BEEN RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH. THE ANSWERS ARE OUT THERE. WE RECENTLY PARTNERED WITH SENATOR PAN TO BRING. MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE WHO HAVE LED THE WAY IN SCALING UP INNOVATIVE PRACTICES ACROSS A BROAD POPULATION. THIS INCLUDED DOCTOR AND SELL EVENT COMMISSIONER OF NEW YORK STATE'S MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WHERE THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING EARLY PSYCHOSIS AND DETECTION AND TREATMENT. PROGRAMS ACCESSIBLE TO YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN CALIFORNIA FEWER THAN HALF OF OUR COUNTIES OFFER SUCH SERVICES. WE BROUGHT IN DOCTOR PATRICK MCCORVEY FROM AUSTRALIA. I CAN'T A COUNTRY THAT HAS MADE AFFORDABLE STIGMA FREE MENTAL HEALTH ACCESSIBLE TO YOUNG PEOPLE. VIRTUALLY IN EVERY COMMUNITY. IN CALIFORNIAWE HAVE JUST A HANDFUL OF COUNTIES EXPERIMENTING WITH A SIMILAR MODEL. THE COMMON THREADS IN ALL THESE EFFORTS ARE BOLD VISION. COMMITTED LEADERSHIP AND CLEARLY DEFINED OBJECTIVES. SO I COME BACK TO MY TALE OF TWO CITIES WITHOUT QUESTION MENTAL HEALTH REMAINS OPPRESSION PRESSING ISSUE. AFFECTING VIRTUALLY EVERY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY. WITHOUT QUESTION COUNTIES HAVE USED MHSAA TO BRING CARE AND RELIEF TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES. AND WITHOUT QUESTION WE CAN DO EVEN BETTER. IT'S TIME FOR US IS SQUARELY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT THAT OVERSEES MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY EMBRACES THAT ISSUE WITH PASSION AND DETERMINATION. AND HELPS LEAD THE WAY TO ENACT NEW ERA WE STAND READY TO HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER BELL TERRIBLE รณ. PREPS FOR ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO ANSWER. AND MAYBE I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN YOUR TAXES. MY WIFE'S FROM TAXES. ARE THERE ANY MODELS AND OTHER STATES THAT ARE BETTER. THEN CALIFORNIA'S MODEL FOR DELIVERY. OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THAT WORK BETTER. AT AND I WOULD INCLUDE LIKE. STATES THAT PROBABLY MORE ROBUSTLY FUN. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ARE THERE ANY EXAMPLES. WE CAN LOOK OUT. IN OUR STUDY OF MAKING AN EFFECTIVE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AS FIRST QUESTION THE SECOND ONE WOULD BE. THEIRS BAND NAM A DESIRE TO INTEGRATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SYSTEMS WITH. OTHER PHYSICAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. THERE'S A DELIVERY OF. INTEGRATED MEDICINE. AND. HOW IS THAT HELPED OR HURT? MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO. SEVERELY NEEDY. INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. SO THOSE ARE TWO QUESTION OTHER STATES. AND. THIS INTEGRATION MOVEMENT HOW DOES IT HELP OR HURT. OUR DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WELL WHEN YOU MENTION STATES IT ALSO HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF FUNDING THAT MIGHT LEAVE TEXAS OUT IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE TEXAS IS NOT ROBUST IF BILLY FUNDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THE WAY WE ARE CERTAINLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT SAID I SPENT FOURTEEN YEARS IN TEXAS TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING CALIFORNIA WORK PERFECTLY AND NOW I'M HERE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE ADVANCES THAT WE'VE MADE IN TEXAS WHEN I WAS THERE. TRAUMA INFORMED CARE BEING A PERFECT EXAMPLE THAT REALLY ISN'T AS FAR ALONG HEARING CALIFORNIA'S IT IS THERE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS IN MY BACKGROUND IS I'M A LIBRARIAN AND I'M ALWAYS LOOKING AT MODELS AROUND THIS THE COUNTRY AN AND SEEING HOW GOVERNMENT CAN BE. NOT RECREATING BUT CONNECTING DOTS AND LOOKING FOR MODELS OF EXCELLENCE AND THAT'S I'VE BEEN BRINGING TO LA COUNTY THAT THAT WASN'T ONE EXAMPLE. IN TERMS OF IMMIGRATION I MEAN. YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH. AND OF CERTAINLY I THINK THE MAJORITY OF COUNTIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE WE DON'T IN LA COUNTY I THINK WE VERY MUCH NEED THAT AND YOU KNOW MY DIRECTOR JOHN SHARON IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH PUBLIC HEALTH. TO CREATE THAT SYNERGY AND I SPENT THE LAST TWO DAYS WITH THE HEAD OF SAMPSON. TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AND TALKING ABOUT HOW EVEN THOUGH SAM'S OF COURSE HAS EXISTED AS AN ENTITY THAT DOES THAT COMBINATION THEY'RE STILL FUNDING SILOS BETTER INCREDIBLY UNFORTUNATE AND I KNOW SHE'S WORKING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THAT WOULD NEED TO. START TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN BE LOOKING AT AT FUNDING INTEGRATION WHICH IS WHAT GETS OUT A LOT OF THE INTEGRATION THAT WE NEED TO SEE. YEAH LIKE GO WHEN WE. IN CALIFORNIA. HAD BUDGET PROBLEMS. WE SIMPLY MERGE THE DEPARTMENTS. AND WE CREATED THIS WE. WE STEP A SEPARATE ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE IN A SEPARATE MENTAL HEALTH AND. THE KIND OF LIKE MERGE THE LEVELS OF. EXECUTIVE A EVEN THOUGH THE FUNCTIONS STAYED THERE ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE STILL THERE. FUNCTIONS OF IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAMS BUT. I'M KIND OF WONDERING IF THAT. LEFT A VOID IN TERMS OF. THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT AND I KNOW THERE IS I BELIEVE PENDING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD LOOK AT A DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH YEAH? IN TEXAS THINKING HAPPEN FOURTEEN AGENCIES TURNED INTO FOUR AND THREE YEARS IN A APART A LARGE PART OF THAT WASN'T SO MUCH ABOUT THE VALUE OF IMMIGRATION BUT SAVING MONEY WHICH OF COURSE IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WAS A CASE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THREE YEARS DOWN IT HAD NOT SAVE MONEY INTERESTINGLY THAT HAD CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION AMONG PEOPLE ON THE FOCUS THAT HAD BEEN ON THE STAND ALONE SUBSTANCE ABUSE. MENTAL HEALTH WAS LOST IN MANY CASES OKAY SO AROUND OTHERS HAVING ITEMS TOUGHNESS YES I WON'T GO INTO A LOT OF DETAIL HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO. FORWARD INFORMATION TO YOU SENATOR ABOUT ON THE COMMITTEE. BUT NEW YORK STATE REALLY AS A MODEL THEY. HAVE INDEPENDENT YOU KNOW COUNTY THAT COUNTY SYSTEM SIMILAR TO OURS THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT GETTING EARLY PSYCHOSIS IDENTIFICATION CHARACTER OUT THERE STATE THEIR OF DIVERSE STATE. AND THEY ALSO HAVE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT ARE TASKED WITH WORKING WITH COUNTIES IN THEIR REGION TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER SUPPORT AND THEY ALSO PROVIDE. OPPORTUNITIES TO DO FOR JUST LISTENING TO COUNTIES AND HEARING WHAT THEY'RE NEEDING BUT THERE IS YOU KNOW I DOCTOR AND SULLIVAN IS A DEDICATED COMMISSIONER. TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND. REALLY A TRUE LEADER IT'S IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE I'D BE HAPPY TO FORWARD THAT INFORMATION TO YOU. YOU. OPINION OF COUNTY. SUPERVISOR OF THE. LEADERS IN THE COUNTY HAVE. I AGREE WITH NEW YORK STATE AND. FOR CHILDREN SERVICES ANALYSIS OF NEW JERSEY MIGHT BE USEFUL. WHAT THEY DO NEW JERSEY'S SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU DESCRIBED? THERE IT'S. THE FUNDING STREAMS ARE INVISIBLE TO THE CONSUMERS SO. A HOWEVER NEW JERSEY WORK THAT OUT IF YOU'RE A CHILD AND YOU NEED HELP YOU CALL THIS ONE LINE. OF ITS AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE BILL BY THE STATE BEHIND THE SCENES IT'S VERY INTERESTING SO IT'S WORTH UNITS WERE SOME ANALYSIS. BUT HOW DO A MISTER CHAIRMAN TOLERATE. SARAH MORE ELECT AND SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THANK YOU PANEL I APOLOGIZE THAT. WE GET TO RUN IN AND OUT SO BY HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING WITH ELAINE HOW. AND HER TEAM. BUT I'D LIKE TO. FOLLOW UP SO MET MISS MERIT. THERE WAS WITH DARRELL STEINBERG LAST WEEK WITH SP ONE ZERO ZERO FOR THE WINTER BILL SO THANK YOU FOR. PORT ON THAT BILL BUT I'M CURIOUS MAYBE TO SET UP FOR THE NEXT SESSION. THE FLOW OF FUNDING. SO THE THE GROUP WE PREPARE THE INCOME TAX A GHOST OF THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD GOES TO THE CONTROLLER. AND THEN IT GOES TO THE COUNTIES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. YOU KNOW I DON'T THERE IS A LIST OF AYE DEPARTMENTS THAT RECEIVE MHSAA FUNDING BUT IN TERMS OF THE COUNTIES ON A MONTHLY BASIS THEY RECEIVE AN ALLOCATION OF MHSAA FUNDS. OKAY AND THEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COME UP WITH. INNOVATION PLANS AND COME UP WITH THINGS AND IT WAS A REAL BLESSING FOR ORANGE COUNTY YOU KNOW DURING THE RECESSION TO START HAVING THAT. PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDING COMING IN BUT. BUT WHO THEN APPROVES THE INNOVATION PLANS AND HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FIT INTO THAT. IN TERMS OF THE OF THE INNOVATION PLANS AND YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM TOBY EWING WHO CAN GO INTO MORE DETAIL. BUT I COUNTY. EACH COUNTY AND ACTUALLY I WE HAVE. PEOPLE RIGHT HERE THAT COULD ACTUALLY ANSWER THIS QUESTION PROBABLY BETTER THAN ME BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND COUNTIES. HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD THEY COME UP WITH A PLAN TO HAVE A CUP PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD. THEY GO BEFORE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT TALK ABOUT THAT PLAN GET APPROVAL AND THEN THEY GO TO THAT. OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AND FOR FINAL APPROVAL. AND SO IF THE COMMISSION SAYS NO WE DON'T LIKE YOUR PLAN. TYPICALLY THAT COMMISSION WOULD GIVE. REASONS OF WE DO NOT THINK THEY WOULD GIVE AYE INPUT AS TO WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGED. AND THE COUNTY'S BASICALLY HAVE TO GO BACK AND. AND OF. WORK ON THAT. THAT PROPOSAL AND THEN COME BACK AGAIN YES HAS THIS BEEN A REASON FOR. SOME OF THE FUNDS. ACCUMULATING WITHOUT BEING SPENT THIS PROCESS OF TRYING SOMETHING AND THEN GETTING A KICK BACK. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND I I DOUBT IT BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND NINETY PERCENT OF THE INNOVATION PROPOSALS THAT COME BEFORE THE OECD ARE APPROVED. NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S A COUPLE AT BATS BEFORE THAT APPROVAL HAPPENS BUT. I'M. YOU MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY I'D LIKE YEAH. I CAN SAY THAT A THERE'S ALSO THERE'S ACTUALLY A ADDITIONAL STEPS IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING TO GO BEFORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT STEERING COMMITTEE. HAVING NO BEFORE THE MENTAL HEALTH BOARD OF THE COUNTY. BEFORE EVEN GETTING TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SO IT IS QUITE CUMBERSOME AND. IT DOES NOT EXACTLY SPEED UP THE FLOW OF THE MONEY YEAH I SEE A RATHER LENGTHY PROCESS AND THAT'S WHY I'M. ASKING SOME QUESTIONS ON WHAT CAN WE DO. THE CAMERA MOVES ALONG BECAUSE I SEE A PARALYSIS ICF FEAR OF A LIABILITY EXPOSURE BUT IF WE DO SOMETHING AND THEN. SOMETHING SOMEBODY SUSAN SAYS YOU SHOULDN'T BEEN USING PROP SIXTY THREE FOR FOR THIS OR FOR THAT WERE SENIOR RIGHT NOW WITH NO PLACE LIKE HOME JUSTIN'S ARE TIGHT AROUND SUPERIOR COURT SACRAMENTO BECAUSE WANNA. BUILD NEEDED HOUSING AND NOW WE'VE GOT ONE PERSON WHO'S YOU KNOW HOLDING IT UP AT ALL THAT. SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU KNOW WITH THIS LOGJAM WORSE TO PRUNE JUICE YOU KNOW WHAT WE. WHAT WE DO AT TRYIN? FREE THINGS UP A LITTLE. MULDER NOW THAT THEY'VE HAD. IF YOU LOOK AT. WELL AGAIN I THINK YOU'LL HEAR. FROM TOBY EWING AS SOON WHO WILL BE ABLE TO GO INTO DEPTH ABOUT THE WORK THEY'RE DOING. THEY RECENTLY. HOSTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH US SEVERAL DIFFERENT GROUPS AND INNOVATION SUMMIT THAT BROUGHT REALLY CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS INTO THE SAME ROOM WHERE THEY BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT REALLY JUST FROM THE. NOT BASIC POINT OF WHAT IS INNOVATION AND I THINK THAT'S A POINT THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED FOR COUNTIES AND I ALSO KNOW. THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION IS WORKING TO PROVIDE COUNTIES MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT I. YOU'RE YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOUR POINT THERE IS PROBABLY SOME STREAMLINING THAT COULD BE DONE AND I. I THINK THAT THAT WE SEE IS WORKING ON. TOWARD THAT. WELL YOU SAID THERE IS NO STATEWIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING. AND DARRELL STEINBERG SAID THE SAME THING LAST WEEK THERE JUST NO LEADERSHIP. THOSE BEATS OKAY WELL I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG INDICTMENT SO IS THIS AUDIT. YEAH AND SO IN MY COUNTY I HAVE A FEDERAL JUDGE USE. SORT OF TAKEN A TIGER BY THE TAIL. AND MOVING OUT HOMELESS CAMPS AND GIVING VOUCHERS YEAH SO THAT'S GOOD FOR A MONTH BUT WHAT YOU DO AFTER THIRTY DAYS I MEAN THIS IS. SORT OF A STRANGE LIKE THE PHENOMENON AND AND AND I'M WONDERING HOW DO WE GRAB THIS TIGER BY THE TAIL AND START. MOVING THINGS BECAUSE. I HAVE A FEDERAL JUDGE AND SEES A BIG BALANCE ON THE COUNTY BOOKS I'M GETTING SUPERVISORS THAT ARE BEING. YOU KNOW RIDICULED AND PUBLIC. YEAH I'M WATCHING MY MHSAA REPRESENTATIVE RESIGN AND THEN LEAVE WITHIN TWO DAYS AND EDITS IT'S REALLY AWKWARD AND IT'S IT'S AT. AS I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS AS ONE PERSON IN ONE COUNTY OF THREE MILLION PEOPLE HOW TO. GET THIS THING WORKING AND WORKING RIGHT SO EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS IT SO. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU JUST SENATOR PAN FOR RELEASED PUTTING SOME SOME THAT EXPERTS TOGETHER I'M JUST WONDERING SINCE I'M A MANAGER NOT A DOCTOR. THAT I KNOW HOW DO I GET IT TO MANAGE. PROPERLY SO THAT WE CAN. NOW GET THE BALL ROLLING BECAUSE THIS IS A GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITY. AND IT'S BANK ACCOUNTSTARTS CHEWING EVERYBODY OUT. THAT'S JUST IT JUST. IT'S JUST THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND IT'S AWKWARD. IF IF I MAY YOUNG CLEAN UP SOME THE PROOF PRUNE JUICE MAY COME FROM A GREATER CLARIFICATION AND GREATER DIRECTION THAT THAT THE AUDIT CALLS FOR. AYE AT THIS TIME COUNTIES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT MEANS WHAT IS INNOVATIVE AND IF WE HAD GREATER DIRECTION WE WE COULD ACT IN A FASTER. BUT YOU'VE GOT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE OR MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS YOU'VE GOT AN ASSOCIATION. AND AND I I'M FINDING IT'S A FORMER SUPERVISOR. THAT APPEAR  <u><c.green>EATEN WE DON'T</c></u> JUST CALL DEPARTMENT HEADS AND AND SAY PICKS THAT. AFFECTS YOU GOT YOUR BILL. YOU KNOW TELL NOT MANAGE WHICH IS REALLY CRAZY WHICH MEANS THAT. YOU SHOULD HAVE COME UP WITH THE BILL. OR GIVEN SOMETHING TO ONE OF US LIKE CENTER BELL JUST BEEN A STAR IN THE MENTAL HEALTH ARENA. AND AND WE GET A CHAMPION THAT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO GET THINGS MOVING SO WHERE IS YOUR BILL. RICHARD I THINK. ON THAT NOTE I HAVE WE DEL STEINBERG INSTITUTE DOES HAVE A PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION THAT SEEKS TO. VALLEY STANDARDISING CARE I THINK WHEN DARRYL AND. RUSTY FELIX WROTE PROP SIXTY THREE. THEY KNOW RIGHTLY SAW THAT COUNTIES ME ED FLEXIBILITY LA COUNTY IS DIFFERENT THE MONA COUNTY THEY NEED FLEXIBILITY. NOW DARRYL IF HE WAS HERE WOULD SAY THAT IN HINDSIGHT NOW HE. I HE WOULD NOT AGREE THAT THEY NEED A HUNDRED PERCENT FLEXIBILITY THEY DO NEED FLEXIBILITY BUT WE ALSO NEED. TO HAVE STANDARDS ACROSS THE STATE THAT PROVIDE EARLY CARE. EARLY QUALITY CARE. AND. SO THAT'S WHAT S. B. TEN ALL FOR. THAT YEAR AUTHORING WITH A SENATOR WIENER THAT SEEKS TO DO WHERE WE IDENTIFY PRIORITIES AND SAY TO COUNTIES THAT. THEY MUST SPEND THEIR PIII DOLLARS PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION DOLLARS. ON ONE OF THESE THREE THINGS EARLY PSYCHOSIS IDENTIFICATION AND SERIOUS MOOD DISORDER. TRANSITION AIDES YOUTH AND WITH THAT FOCUS ON THAT CAN MAKING CONNECTIONS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AS WE HAVE. TWO HUNDRED. STUDENTS ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES DYING FROM AYE SUICIDE ANNUALLY EVERY YEAR WE LOSE TWO HUNDRED KIDS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. UP FROM SUICIDE AND. NORTHERN PRAIRIE. BAKER YES TRAUMA INFORMED CARE RIGHT IN THEM WE HAVE ALL SEEN THOSE STUDIES THERE WAS JUST A BRILLIANT. COMMITTEE MEETING THAT TALK ALL ABOUT ACES ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND FROM THAT WE WE KNOW THAT. WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE EARLY IN THEIR LIVES AND PROVIDE. THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES THE KIND OF SUPPORT AND CARE THEY NEED THEY GET TO THRIVE. THEY GET TO THRIVE IN THEIR LIFE SO THAT'S WHAT TEN OH FOUR IS WE HAVE A WHOLE BILL LISTS A AND WITH ABOUT SEVEN TOP PRIORITIES CHANNEL FOUR IS OUR TOP. BUT I THINK MORE DIRECTION AND THEN BESIDES THAT IS UNTIL LOOK TO THE STATE SO I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT NEW NEW JERSEY THAT WHAT IT WAS I WILL LOOK INTO THAT. AT LIKE AND NEW YORK LIKE WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT RIGHT RENO WHAT WORKS SO WE NEED. AND WHAT THE AUDIT REALLY FOCUSES ON IS LEADERSHIP. AND WE THINK THAT'S TRUE WHEN WE ARE READ THROUGH THE AUDIT. I DON'T KNOW THE RESPONSES TO THE AUDITOR'S REQUESTS AND. SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT. LACK LUSTER. AND WE THINK THAT IT'S TIME FOR THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING MENTAL SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA THAT THEY LEAN IN. AND THAT THEY REALLY DO YOU. IDENTIFY MENTAL HEALTH IS A TOP PRIORITY AND THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES IN THAT SAME WAY. THANK YOU MISS MERIT THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME PICK ON YOU A LITTLE. RIGHT MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU CHAIR MURATSUCHI AND I'M NOT A MEMBER OF JAIL LACK BY PRESHEAF THE OPPORTUNITY HERE NOVICE THESE IS AN ISSUE OF GREAT INTEREST DAHLE THANK CENTER BELFER. HELPING INITIATE THIS AYE THAT NO ONE THINK OTHERS FOR YOUR. EXCELLENT WORK. MEAL WE ACTUALLY DID DO. TOUCH ON THIS ISSUE AT A HEARING OF THE. BUDGET. SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES BECAUSE AS WE WERE DOING OUR OVERSIGHT OVER DAMAGE TO SAY TO THE BUDGETARY PROCESS. I A. DO WHAT TO. ASK COUPLE QUESTIONS OF THE GROUP HERE. THAT SERVE RELATES TO SOME OF THE THINGS FOUND THE OUT OF BUT TO SERVE STEPPING BACK AND LOOKING SUBSISTENCE ISSUE SO. SO I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT. WHEN THE EMMY TO SAVE US PASSED IT DID INCLUDE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF POTENTIALLY STATE OVERSIGHT THROUGH THE INITIATIVE. AND. WE HAVE THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION SO FORTH I WOULD ALSO MAKE NO TO THAT. THAT COUNTIES ALSO RECEIVE. FAIRLY LARGE SOME ACTUALLY PROBABLY ABOUT. YOU KNOW ROUGHLY ARE THE SAME SIZE OR LARGER THAN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM AS WELL FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AS WELL AND OF COURSE THAT. IS DONE THE. UNDER A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES AND SOME SENSES AND HOW ONE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT OVER THAT IN TERMS OF OF THAT IN TERMS OF. RESPONSIVE THE STATE ARE SO SO FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR SPECIALLY THE COUNTY. WE HAVE VARIOUS CAL YEARS IS THAT. WHAT DO YOU SEE AS HOW WE INTEGRATE? IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET TO. THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS OUR MENTAL HEALTH GOALS OVERALL I THINK THAT WE SHOULD YEAH AND IT WAS TOUCHED ON ABOUT FUNDING STREAMS AND SO FORTH YOU HAVE MHSAA MONEY YOU HAVE MEDICAID MONEY. FOR MENTAL HEALTH YOU GOT SOME OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING BUT I THINK THOSE ARE TWO BIG ONES. HOW DO THEY COME TOGETHER? AND SAID SAYING WELL MEDI CAL MONEY HAD DOES THIS AND AND I SYSTEM IS GONNA DO THAT BECAUSE BASICALLY. WE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS THAT RUN ACROSS COUNT HOW. HOW HOW DO WE GET? HOW DO WE GET A UNIFIED THEIR COLLECTIVE YOU KNOW? SALAS YOUR HOW A MENTAL HEALTH GOALS COUNTIES AND HOW THEN IS THAT. RELATE TO THE CHEATING STATE MENTAL HEALTH GOALS SO HE SPEAK TO HOW EACH COUNTY LOOKS AT AND IT'S A SAY IN THE MATTER CAL AND HOW DO THEY TRY TO PUT THEM TOGETHER ARE NOT TO OR ANYTHING CITY TO GO ABOUT WATER MENTAL HEALTH GOALS ARE. YOU HAVE TO DRUM FOUGHT MY ONE FRANKLY DOESN'T HAVE. AS MUCH YOU KNOW I LEASE OF AND IT'S A SAD DRIVE BECAUSE WAS INITIATIVE THERE SOMEBODY YOU HAVE TO GO CHECK IN WITH. AND WE HAVE FACT INSURE DHS WILL BE UP YOUR LITTLE LATER BUT. ON THE MEDI CAL SIDE I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN THERE'S VERY LITTLE BASICALLY STATE DOLES OUT THE MONEY AND WE DON'T HEAR MUCH ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVELY IT'S BEING USED. AND BACK EVEN CMS HAS POINTED THAT OUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS A PARTNER IN THE MEDICAL SIDE HAS. HAS ACCURATE CRITICIZED ON CALIFORNIA FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH OVERSIGHT OVER DOES FUNDS AND YET THAT'S A. NORMAL STRUCK A MONEY AS WELL SO HOW HOW WE PUT ALL THOSE PIECES TOGETHER. WELL ONE OF THE THINGS I GOT A COUPLE COMMENTS COME TO MIND ONE IS INTERNALLY YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE HAD A STRUCTURE IN TOTAL OUR NEW DIRECTOR STARTED ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO THAT WAS REALLY DRIVEN BY. FUNDING STREAMS MORE THAN DRIVEN BY ALLOCATION OF OUR SERVICES AND HOW WE ARE PROMOTING HEALTH ACROSS THE COUNTY SO WE HAVE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS ACTUALLY TOTALLY REDONE THAT SO IT'S NO LONGER DRIVEN BY FUNDING STREAMS IS DRIVEN BY. PROGRAMS AND OUTCOMES AND DATA AND NOT LOOKING AT IT IN DIFFERENT POTS WE ALSO OF COURSE PART OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AS WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT REQUIRES A LOT OF THAT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. SO WE HAD TO STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT WAS LOOKING AT IMAGES A DOLLARS AND THEY WERE ASKING US WHY REALLY LOOKING AT IMAGES A DOLLARS THAT DOES MAKE SENSE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. RIGHT AND SO WE AND THAT APPARENTLY PEOPLE TELL ME WHAT BEFORE THIS PAST THERE WAS SUCH A GROUP SO NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HOLISTICALLY BECAUSE I SAID IN MY COMMENTS. PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE THINKING ABOUT THOSE FUNDING STREAMS WE NEED TO OF COURSE IN TERMS OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS AROUND THEM BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT SHOULD NOT BE DRIVING THE SYSTEM. SO AT LEAST INTERNALLY AS WELL AS THOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT A VERY DIFFERENT WAY. AND HE SAID YOU START DOING THAT HOW LONG AGO WELLS ARE DIRECTOR STARTED A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WHEN I STARTED EIGHT MONTHS AGO WE LOOKED AT THE WAY THE SYSTEM WAS I MEAN MY FIRST DAY I TRIED TO GET AN ORG CHART IS LIKE NO NO NO. IT'S CHANGING SO AGAIN I MEAN WE CAN ONLY SPEAK TO WHAT YOU KNOW DOCTOR SHARON AND I HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE WE CAME ON BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING IT VERY DIFFERENTLY. AND AGAIN WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF OF INPUT FROM AROUND THE COUNTY FOR AS INCLUDING FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND ARE CEO'S OFFICE THAT ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW STRUCTURE. AND CERTAINLY STAKEHOLDERS SO YOU KNOW AGAIN WE WERE NOT DONE BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY ALONG THE WAY. AND I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION AND GET FOR IT IS LIKE HOW MANY OTHER COUNTIES DO IT THAT WAY. THAT YOU CAN. OF WHAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED IS AS A MY MY LIFE EVERY DAY HAVE. IS HAVE BALANCING THE FUNDING STREAMS WITH THE PROGRAM NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND THE WAY THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IS THE CURRENT FUNDING STRUCTURE. DOES APPEAR TO BE VERY SEDUCTIVELY ENTICING COUNTIES TO GO BY FUNDS DRIVEN VERSUS. STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN. BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES AROUND THE FUNDING AND THE AND THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF EACH COUNTY THAT'S A VERY STRONG. ARGUMENT FOR KEEPING THE MHSAA FUNDING LOCALLY CONTROLLED. BECAUSE ONE OF THE A COUPLE OF THE MAIN POTS OF MONEY OF THEM SURE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS TO TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT DOLLARS. IF YOU'VE EVER LOOKED AT THOSE REALIGNMENT FORMULAS THEY ARE DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO PAY ATTENTION TO. IN OUR COUNTY WE HAVE THE FOURTH LARGEST POPULATION THE STATE. AND. I THINK WE GET MAYBE FIFTY SEVEN OUT OF FIFTY NINE EIGHT AT THAT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF OUR REALIGNMENT DOLLARS. SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE OUR MEDI CAL REALIGNMENT DOLLARS WITH THIRTY PST TEA WITH OUR MISSILE DOLLARS. AND STILL PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE THAT WE CAN TO OUR COMMUNITIES SO IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED SITUATION. ARE COUNTIES UNDER HIRING FREEZE RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STRUCTURAL DEFICITS BECAUSE OFFERS ALL THE THINGS COME INTO PLAY WITH A FUNDING STREAMS. SO IT'S COMPLEX. I I KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED BUT ALREADY DOING THE WORK MAKE IT ALL I HEAR LA COUNTY IS DOING THAT. WHAT YEAH WHAT WE DO TO MAKE IT WORK WHAT WE'VE HAD TO? PAUL THESE THINGS TOGETHER RATE OF KING AT THEM AS. WELL WECONTINUE TO FOCUS ON HER STAKEHOLDER INPUT I MEAN MIMI'S. APPROACH IS EXACTLY WHERE WE WERE ALWAYS NEEDING TO BE IS WHAT DID THE STAKEHOLDERS WANT AND HOW CAN WE MAKE IT HAPPEN. SO. ARE A REALIGNMENT DOLLARS GO TOWARDS ARE SHRINKING HOSPITAL BEDS. IT WE'VE GOT IT GOING OFF TOPIC A LITTLE BIT IF YOU KNOW THE CRISIS OF OF HOSPITALIZATION BEDS SO USED MS SIXTY DOLLARS TO FUND THAT THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP THE HOMELESS PROGRAMS. SO WE WORK ON A CONTINUUM OF CARE WHERE WE KNOW EACH FUNDING STREAM CAN FIND A LITTLE BIT OF A DESCRIPTIVE OF ADAPTING TO THE DETAILS EXACTLY HOW WHAT YOU DECIDED TO DO SO THERE IS A. UNIFIED PROCESS AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY TO DEVELOP A ESSENTIALLY A SO THAT THE PLAN FOR ALL OF MENTAL HEALTH IN THE COUNTY YES ACTUALLY THROUGHT AND STATE YOUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS ACTUALLY LIKE LA EX ENCOMPASSES ALL THE FUNDING NOT JUST I MEAN TO SAY. IT IT HAS TO ITEM NO YES. OKAY WE WILL ALSO HAVE A CONSULTANT IN OUR COUNTY RIGHT NOW WHO'S HELPING US OUTSIDE OF KPMG IS. COMING DOWN IN MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS SO. CENTER PANDA IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I. IF YOU HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION I DO HAVE AN OAK FELT QUESTION SO. THE OTHER QUESTION ACTUALLY I WAS TESTIFIED ABOUT THE STATE'S STRATEGIC PLAN I'LL SAY I HAVE A BILL. TO URGE FOR A SENSUALLY TO MAKE A STEP TOWARD THE STATE'S STRATEGIC PLAN. I'VE DECIDED IN THAT BILL NOT TO BE SPECIFIC PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE IN AT WE HAVE A PROCESS. AND BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SAID WHEN YOU SEE STRATEGIC PLAN. MANY SAVE ELEVATION CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I'VE SUPPORTED. SIR WINNERS BILLS WELL WHICH IS TO SPECIFY CERTAIN THINGS RIGHT NOW BUT WE ALSO KNOW THINGS CAN EVOLVE OVER TIME WE HAVE NEEDS GOVERNOR HE'S. THAT AND OTHER SITUATIONS CHANGE AT IS THAT SOMETHING STEINBERG INSTITUTE IS I MEAN I HEAR YOU TESTIFYING ONCE THESE FEW PLAN WILL BE SUPPORTING. WE WOULD LOVE TO LOOK AT YOUR PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND THE FOLLOWING WE HAVE HOARDED DO YOU. OUR PARTNERSHIP. YEAH. KEEPING IN LEADERS. ALRIGHT THANK YOU ON THAT NOTE THAT WE WANT TO THANK A. OF THIS PANEL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR COMING IN. APPEAR. ALL RIGHT NEXT. COMMENTS AND RESPONSES. FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. OUR AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. GREAT SO. WHEN THE PERSON. YOU DON'T HAVE A. THANK YOU FOR A PERHAPS IF IF YOU CAN TRY TO. AYE KNOW I INITIALLY SIT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND SO. IF YOU NEED THE FULL FIFTEEN DE BUT. OTHERWISE WE I THINK WE WANT TO HAVE A. OPPORTUNITY TO. ENGAGED IN THAT. RIGHT A DISK I'M SO GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER CAN. DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND I DEFINITELY WILL NOT TAKE THE FULL FIFTEEN MINUTES. I WANT TO SAY FIRST. IN RECOGNITION OF WHAT WAS AND MENTIONED IN THE LAST PANEL. THE POSITIVE ABOUT THE IMAGE TO SAY IS THAT CALIFORNIA DID. MANY MANY YEARS AGO TAKE A STEP TO AND ACTIVISTS A SOLID FUNDING STREAM THAT WAS DEDICATED TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES LONG BEFORE. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE. AGAINST POPULAR IN THE HEALTH UP POLICY WORLD AND OBVIOUSLY SENATOR BELL. BACK WHEN HE WAS A FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER BELL HAS DONE BEEN LEADING THE WAY IN TERMS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CONVERSATION. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. JUST FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH OUR PROGRAM IN OUR DEPARTMENT AS. AS WE ARE THERE ARE FOUR MAIN FUNDING STREAMS THAT COUNTIES USED TO PROVIDE. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO THERE'S THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS THERE'S A TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT DOLLARS SHOULD THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUB ACCOUNT. THERE ARE IMAGES SAY DOLLARS THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF GENERAL FUND OBVIOUSLY FOR THE PIECES THAT WE FUND AND THEN THERE IS I'M FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION THAT COMES THROUGH. THE MEDICAID SIDE. IT IS. EACH FUNDING STREAM AS YOU JUST HEARD HAS ITS OWN ON PACIFIC RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR WHICH WE ARE. OVERSEEN THOSE I'M FUNDS I THINK THE BENEFIT. LIES IN EACH AND THEIR. BOTH EITHER FLEXIBILITY OR IN THERE ON DEATH SO WHILE YOU WILL HEAR A LOT OF. CONSTRAINTS AND RULES AND REGULATIONS AROUND MEDICAID DOLLARS ON THOSE OUR ENTITLEMENT DOLLARS WHICH MEANS THAT THERE UNLIMITED SO TO THE EXTENT THAT A COUNTY HAS. MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WITH MEDICAL NEEDS FFP AND THOSE ASSOCIATED FEDERAL FUNDS ON FLOW FOR AS MANY PEOPLE THAT NEED THE SERVICE AND THAT IS THE ONE BENEFIT OBVIOUSLY. TO WHAT FFP BRINGS TO THE. OVERALL DELIVERY SYSTEM THE BEAUTY AND THE BENEFIT OF ANY TO SAY DOLLARS AS THAT THEY ARE INFINITELY MORE FLEXIBLE. AND I THINK THAT HOW THEY WERE INTENDED TO BE USED AS HOW THEY ARE BEING USED. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH MONEY MHSAA HAS. BEEN COLLECTED OVER THE LAST. MANY YEARS FOR THE SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE ATTACKS. ESPECIALLY. AND SINCE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING I'M DATING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE YOU HAVE APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED AND DISTRIBUTED TO THE COUNTIES THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY. MILLION. THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE AUDIT THAT IS SUBJECT TO REVERSION IS ALL THAT REMAINS OUT OF THAT OVER THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED AND SPENT BY THE COUNTIES. IF YOU DIDN'T READ THE AUDIT OR YOU'RE NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE ACT ON EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE FUNDING THAT FLOWS TO COUNTIES. IS DEDICATED TO COMMUNITY SUPPORTS AND SERVICES SAID THESE ARE FOR DIRECT SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH EITHER. EARLY EMERGING OR. SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. IT IS NOT A MEANS TESTED A FUNDING SOURCE SO AGAIN IN OUR WORLD FROM THE DEPARTMENT THAT WE SIT AND MEDICAID AS A MEANS TESTED PROGRAM MEANING YOU HAVE TO BE BELOW A CERTAIN INCOME LEVEL. CLIP AGAIN THE FLEXIBILITY. AND SOME OF THE. BENEFIT OF MHSAA IS THAT IT'S NOT A MEANS TESTED FUNDING SOURCE AND THAT COUNTIES CAN USE THOSE FUNDS FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL THAT NEEDS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SO. WE WORK WITH THE COUNTY'S QUITE CLOSELY TO AND WHAT WE SAY BRAID FUNDING TOGETHER MEANING THEY USE THAT REALIGNMENT DOLLARS THEY USE THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF ACCOUNT DOLLARS THEY USE MEDICAID MONEY. THEY USE MHSAA DOLLARS ON TO. FULLY DELIVER SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS ON AND THAT WAS REALLY WHAT THE PANEL WAS TRYING TO SAY IS REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDS SOURCE THEY'RE TRYING TO DELIVER A. ENTIRE PACKAGE BOTH BENEFIT AND SERVICE INDIVIDUALS THAT REQUIRE IT. I'M WE. AGREE WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE AUDITS FINDINGS ON THE TWO AREAS THAT WE DISAGREED ON MORE CERTAINLY NOTED IN OUR RESPONSES AROUND. REASONABLE AND PRUDENT RESERVES AS WELL AS IN THE FISCAL REGULATIONS I KNOW THAT. WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COUNTIES OVER WHAT. A PRUDENT RESERVE SHOULD BE. I THINK THAT YOU WILL AND. I THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS AS TO WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE THE VOLATILITY OF THE FUND ITSELF. ANY TO SAY IS A TAX ON INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOMES OVER A MILLION DOLLARS GIVEN THE WAY THAT OUR CURRENT TAX STRUCTURE IS AND HOW IT'S BASED ON CAPITAL GAINS. THAT. COLLECTION OF FUNDING IS QUITE VOLATILE AS MOST OF THOSE STATES OTHER AYE REVENUE SOURCES ARE AND SO I THINK WE HAVE. SEEN THE WHAT THE RECESSION DID TO SOME OF THE COUNTIES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY FUNDED. SERVICES AND SO I THINK ARE. INCLINATION IS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE. RISK AVERSE IN TERMS OF HOW THE RESERVES ARE DEDICATED IS NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM OUR INTENT TO HAVE COUNTY SITTING ON VAST RESERVES WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE EXCESSIVE. BUT WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT IN TIMES OF DOWNTURN ALL OF THE FUNDING STREAMS THAT FLOW TO THE COUNTIES THE REALIGNMENT ACCOUNT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ACCOUNT AND ME TO SAY. THOSE ALL WAX AND WANE WITH THE ECONOMY AND SO WE'RE. EXTRAORDINARILY MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN I'M HAVING A RESERVE THAT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE GENEROUS THAN NOT. COULD CERTAINLY BENEFIT THE CITIZENS THAT ARE. RELYING UPON THOSE FUNDS SO. WITH FAT AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANSWER QUESTIONS ACTION OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH BEFORE WE. OPEN IT TO QUESTIONS NOW I I'D LIKE TO. FIRST TO. I INVITED W. INK FOR AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE SAID IN COUNTERVAILING COMMISSION TO ALSO GET COMMITTEE CHAIR MY NAME'S W. AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MIDDLE SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR SETTING UP THIS MEETING TODAY. AS WELL AS THE AUDITOR AND HER STAFF FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DID ON THE REPORT. THE COMMISSION INITIALLY SUPPORTED. SENATOR BELLS ASK TO THE TENANTS HAD ABOUT A COMMITTEE FOR THE AUDIT. AND. AND WE WERE INVITED TO COME AND TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND I'D HAD ENVISIONED. THAT MIGHT BE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY WHERE STATE AGENCY WAS WAS POSITIVELY ASKING TO BE AUDITED. SO AND IT WAS A CONSENT ITEMS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BUT THE COMMISSION WAS VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THE AUDIT BECAUSE IT FURTHERS THIS BROAD GOAL OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THE EMMA TO SAY. AND AND WE SEE THE CONVERSATION AS CONTINUING. THE WORK THAT THAT THE COMMISSION HAD LAUNCHED STARTING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN AND WE PROVIDED YOU A COPY OF A REPORT THAT WE PROVIDE THAT WE. PREPARED ON REVERSION. WHICH BEGAN TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULES AROUND REPORTING AND USE OF THE FUNDS. AND. THE. THE AUDIT AS THE AUDITOR SAID THERE WERE THREE CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED IN TERMS OF THE COMMISSION'S WORK AND AND WHERE AGGRESSIVELY WORKING TO STRENGTHEN THOSE ISSUES THE FIRST WAS AROUND. CONTINUING TO SUPPORT COUNTIES AROUND INNOVATION AND AND SO I WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT WE STREAMLINED THE PROCESS WE'VE PROVIDED GREATER. CLARITY IN TERMS OF MATERIALS WE'VE DONE WHAT WE CALL A LITTLE A LITTLE INNOVATION TOOL KIT THAT WE PROVIDE TO THE COUNTIES THIS MORNING I WAS. MEETING WITH. THAT DETRACTED RELATES WITH THE IMAGES TAKE COORDINATOR FOR THE COUNTIES TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS OF THE COMMISSION IS DOING TO STRENGTHEN THAT. IN IN TERMS OF THAT THE BROAD GOAL OF THE INNOVATION COMPONENT OF THE KNOW HOW SERVICES ACT. AND THEY WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT IS THAT IS IN FRONT OF YOU IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. IS THE COMMISSION IS PROPOSING TO LAUNCH INNOVATION INCUBATOR AS A STRATEGY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE COUNTIES ONE OF THE ASIDE FROM THE ISSUE OF PROCESS WHICH ALL GET INTO BECAUSE IT CAME UP EARLIER. WITH THE COMMISSION IS REALLY WORKING TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF THE COUNTIES TO LEARN COLLECTIVELY AND THAT'S WHAT THE INNOVATION DO IT IT IT'S A STRUCTURAL FEATURE OF THE ACT THAT RECOGNIZES. THAT THERE MANY ASPECTS OF OUR SYSTEM THAT ARE NOT AS WORKING AS WELL AS THEY NEED TO BE AND SO IT'S A MANDATE. TO OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO ACTUALLY TRY NEW THINGS. TRYING NEW THINGS CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT. IN FEBRUARY WE HOSTED AN INNOVATION EVENT WITH THE TECH SECTOR AND THAT AND THE MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS AND PROVIDERS CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS ARE BROUGHT TO THE THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE. TRULY LOOK AT HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN AS A STRATEGY TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW WE. HOW WE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THE PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF STATE ADMIN FUNDS TO HELP US LAUNCH INNOVATION INCUBATOR? THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING THAT THE FOCUS ON EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WHO END UP. DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL BECAUSE OF THE BACKLOG OF NEED IN THE STATE HOSPITALS. THE COMMISSION VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT WE'RE THRILLED AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO REALLY IMPROVE THE PLANNING SIDE IN THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CIDER AND INNOVATION. THE QUESTIONS ALSO CONCERNED AROUND INNOVATION OTHER AREAS AS WELL PARTICULARLY STRATEGIES TO SERVE CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR PREVENTION OR INTERVENTION. SO WE WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENDORSE THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE AUDITOR TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN HOW WE HOW WE ADDRESS THAT INNOVATION COMPONENT OF THE ACT. IN THE OF THE SECOND PIECE IS ABOUT THE DATA THAT THE COMMISSION BEGAN TO RECEIVE IN DECEMBER AND SO IS THE AUDITOR POINTED OUT THIS IS A BRAND NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THE DATA BEGINNING TO ROLL AND WE ABSOLUTELY WILL DEVELOP AN ANALYTIC FRAMEWORK TO ANALYZE THAT DATA BUT IT'S VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS NOT ALL COUNTIES HAVE REPORTED IT'S A IT'S A NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENT. AND SO WE'RE JUST NOT SURE WE CAN WE CAN PUT THAT FRAMEWORK IN PLACE IN THE TIME FRAME THAT THE AUDITOR HAS RECOMMENDED BUT WE'LL DO OUR BEST. AND IN THE THIRD FINDING OF THE AUDIT WAS THAT THE COMMISSION MOVE FROM A LOCAL EVALUATION STRATEGY FOR TRIAGE PROGRAMS TO STATEWIDE STRATEGY. WHAT THAT MEANS IS FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN THE COMMISSION FIRST ISSUED FUNDING FOR WHAT'S WHAT WE COLOR TRIAGE PROGRAM WE REQUIRED EACH COUNTY TO DESIGN AND EVALUATION INTO THEIR PROPOSAL? THE INTENT WAS TO ALLOW THE COUNTIES TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR PROGRAMS WORKING FOR THEM. AND TO GIVE THAT DETAILED NEW WANTS DAY THAT WOULD HELP THEM STRENGTHENED THEIR OWN PROGRAM. AS THEY THOUGHT ABOUT A STRATEGIES TO SUSTAIN THE FUNDING ONCE THE GRANT DOLLARS THAT WE PROVIDED TO THEM WERE GONE. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN YOU DO THAT REAL LOCAL NEW WANTS TO VALUATION IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO TELL STATEWIDE STORY AND SO THE COMMISSION HAS SHIFTED THE STRATEGY. AND WERE MOVING TOWARD THE STATE LEVEL EVALUATION TO LOOK ACROSS THE COUNTY INVESTMENTS WITH IT WITH THESE TRIAGE DOLLARS INTO THAT THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION. MADE IN NOVEMBER AND THAT'S VERY ALIGNED WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDITOR. ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU HEARD EARLIER WAS ABOUT THE DELAYS IN SPENDING THE MONEY. WHETHER OR NOT THE COMMISSION'S PROCESS WAS WHAT PART OF THE REASON WHY THEY'RE UNSPENT FUNDS I THINK THE AUDITOR REPORTED ABOUT SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF THE END SPENT FUNDS HAS CURRENTLY REPORTED BY THE DEPARTMENT IS INNOVATION FUNDS. THE AUDITOR ALSO FOUND THAT OUR PROCESS WAS NOT LIKELY THE CAUSE FOR THAT DELAY WE'VE APPROVED NINETY THREEPERCENT OF THE PLANS THAT COME BEFORE US. AND EIGHT OUT OF TEN OF THOSE GET APPROVED WITHIN ABOUT NINETY DAYS AND THE REST TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIMES AND HAS BECAUSE OF SOME BACK AND FORTH. SO. YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THE COUNTIES CAN BE FRUSTRATED WHEN THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THIS VERY RIGOROUS PROCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN IT COMES TO THE COMMISSION. AND THE COMMISSION RAISES CONCERNS PART OF THE GOAL OF ESTABLISHING THIS INNOVATION INCUBATOR IS TO STRENGTHEN THE PROCESS AT THE FRONT END. RATHER THAN. HAVE THE COMMISSION'S INVOLVEMENT AFTER ALL OF THAT INVESTMENT HAS BEEN MADE LOCALLY. TO TRY TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT CONTINUES TO PRESERVE THE ABILITY OF THE PROCESS TO BE DRIVEN BY LOCAL PRIORITIES. SO WORD WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS INVESTMENT IN THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN PLANNING SUPPORT STRATEGY WILL ADDRESS MANY OF THE CHALLENGES. THE COUNTIES ARE FACING IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR PROPOSALS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE COMMISSION'S ABILITY. SUPPORT THEM ALONG THE WAY RATHER THAN TO HAVE THAT CLASS AFTER THEY'VE DONE THAT A CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT IN LOCAL PLANNING IN THE LOCAL PRESENTATION THE APPROVAL BY THE BOARD. AND THEN IT COMES BEFORE A STATE BODY THAT THAT. THAT IS NOT SATISFIED ACCORD OR DOES NOT SUPPORT THE DIRECTION AT THE HEADED AND. AGAIN WE'VE WE'VE APPROVED NINETY THREE PERCENT OF THE PLANS IN THAT IN THAT IN THE WINDOW FROM I THINK THE END OF TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH TO TODAY. AND SO I THINK THE RECORD SHOWS THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE ACTUALLY. ENGAGING THE COUNTIES WE CREATED A PROCESS THAT'S PRETTY PRETTY EFFICIENT PRETTY PRETTY QUICK AND ACTUALLY DOES FOR THE MOST PART RESULT IN APPROVALS WHEN THE COMMISSION DOES TURN COUNTY DOWN IT IT GIVES THE RIGHT EXPLAINS THE CHALLENGE FOR THE OR BUT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR. AND RECOMMEND THAT THEY COME BACK WITH A REVISED PROPOSAL SOMETIMES THAT WORKS SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T. LASTLY I WOULD SAY THAT. WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS WE GIVE ANYONE IS A IT'S A DASHBOARD WHERE WE TRACK PLANS. AND SO YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY PENDING REVIEW BY THE COMMISSION YOU CAN SEE THOSE ARE IN THE QUEUE. YOU CAN SEE THE ONES THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED AN AMOUNT OF FUNDS AND THEIR SEVEN COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT PRESENTED IN ANY INNOVATION PLANS BEFORE THE COMMISSION SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. SO WE THINK THERE'S OF RANGE OF REASONS WHY THE FUNDS ARE BEING ALLOCATED AND IT'S IT'S. THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF OUR OWN INTERNAL PROCESS BUT THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE BILL IF COUNTIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE FUNDS. THE AM I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TO OTHER THINGS ONE IS THAT IT'S A SCREENSHOT OF OUR FISCAL TRANSPARENCY TOOL THIS IS LIVE ON OUR WEBSITE TODAY. IT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC AND POLICYMAKERS TO CLICK ON THEIR COUNTY AND IDENTIFY THE REVENUES THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM AND I JUST SAY OVER MULTIPLE YEARS THE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT. AND THE MONEY THAT'S IN THE BANK AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE I KNOW HOW SERVICES ACT REQUIRES THE COUNTIES TO GO THROUGH A COMMUNITY PLANNING PROCESS. AND SO WE'RE WORKING TO ESTABLISH TOOLS THAT SUPPORT THAT PLANNING PROCESS AND THERE'S THREE COMPONENTS AND SO I'M SORRY MINE IS IN COLOR IT'S MUCH NICER. THE FIRST COMPONENT IS FISCAL TRANSPARENCY. AND SO THAT IS LIVE ON OUR SITE TODAY. THE SECOND COMPONENT IS AROUND SERVICES AND PROGRAMS AND SO WE'RE WORKING TO DEVELOP A TOOL WHERE YOU CAN CLICK ON YOUR COUNTY AND SEE THE SERVICES THAT ARE THAT ARE SUPPORTED WITH THESE PUBLIC DOLLARS. THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED INCLUDING INFORMATION ON PEOPLE SERVED AND THE LAST PIECE IS THE OUTCOMES AND FOR OUTCOMES WERE BUILDING OFF OF THE LANGUAGE THAT IS IN THE ACT ALREADY. THAT INCLUDES AMONG OTHER OUTCOMES THINGS LIKE REDUCING CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT SO WE HAVE A PRELIMINARY DATA MATCH BETWEEN FSP DATA BETWEEN. OF PEOPLE HER SIR BY FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS HIGHEST AND HIGHEST LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BASED CARE. AND WE'RE LINKING THAT TO DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO BEGIN TO DEVELOP SOME DATA AROUND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DO BECOME CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVED. AND TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT KINDS OF INVESTMENTS ACTUALLY REDUCE THAT CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. OUR INTENT AND IT'LL TAKE US IT'LL TAKE US THREE TO FIVE YEARS IS WHAT WE'VE SUGGESTED TO THE IN THE IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUDITOR. IS THAT THE PUBLIC WILL BE ABLE TO CLICK ON A SINGLE SITE AND SEE THE DOLLARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT COMMITTEE PLANNING PROCESS TO SEE THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM YOU HAVE AT THE MOMENT. TO SEE WHO SERVED BY THAT SYSTEM WHERE IT'S LOCATED GEOGRAPHICALLY IN THE KIND OF SERVICES THAT ARE OFFERED AND BE ABLE TO CLICK ON YOUR COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES. AND TO SEE INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SERVED OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO ARE SUPPORTED IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DIVERTED OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE SUPPORTED IN THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP AND RETAIN TO TO GET AND RETAIN A JOB? AND NOW THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO ARE PREVENTED FROM. AB BEING REMOVED FROM THEIR HOME TO CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. AND OTHER OUTCOMES THAT ARE THAT ARE BOTH IN THE ACT AND IMPORTANT TO CREATE THAT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE BUT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION GOING. ALRIGHT THANK YOU FELT ABOUT WELL A. FIRST. I WANNA. LET MY COLLEAGUES. NO THAT. WIN. I RECALL THIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN. WHEN. DARRELL STEINBERG. EVERYBODY TALKED TO ME ABOUT TO. RUSTY SEALER X. OF COURSE AND THE OTHERS TALKED ABOUT DOING THE CAMPAIGN FOR. PROP SIXTY THREE AND THEN WE. WE STARTED CAMPAIGNING FOR AND WE HAD. FUND RAISERS AND ALL THE ALL THE THINGS WE DID. CAMPAIGN. AND. I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT OF OUR. COUNTY AND SANTA CLARA SMELL HEALTH COMMISSION NOT A STRAW MAN AND SHE. HER HUSBAND COURSES LE ECONOMICS PROFESSOR AT SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY. AND TALKING ABOUT. WITH HIM. MONEY SPENT JIM. OKAY AND THERE WAS PROVISIONS AS I'D NO NO NO NO THERE WAS A PROVISION. YOU KNOW WE WE WE WE TALKED ABOUT IT. DURING THE CAMPAIGN THERE WAS PROVISION AND. IN THE ACT. IN THE ACT THAT WE PUT IN THERE THAT. IN THREE YEARS. THE IF THEY DANCE MONDAY WAS A USE IT OR LOSE IT. PROVISION IN THE ACT. THAT THE MONEY HAD TO BE SPENT. IN THREE YEARS AND WHAT THE REASON WAS FOR IT WAS GOOD FISCAL MANAGEMENT FOR THAT. THAT GOOD FISCAL MANAGEMENT MEANING. MENU HAD DISBANDED IN THREE YOU KNOW CENTER MORE LIKE WOULD. I DON'T KNOW. IF IT GOES BEYOND IF THE BALANCE IS GO BEYOND THREE YEARS PRETTY SOON THEY GET LOST RIGHT. IN THE IN. COUNTY BUDGET LAND OR WHATEVER PRETTY SOON THE MONEY. KIND OF. IT'S HARD TO TRACK IT BECOMES HARDER AND HARDER TRAPPED. AND IN FACT THE AUDITOR. HERE. TALKED ABOUT. GOING BACK. SEVERAL YEARS AND THEY CAN'T REALLY FIGURE OUT THIS STILL. HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY'RE STILL. TRYING TO TRACK OKAY. SO. THAT'S. WE DON'T SHE WE'RE NOT REALLY THERE'S NO DETENT DEFENDED OF. AUDIT TRAIL YET. IS NO DEFENDER OF AUDIT TRAIL YET WE DON'T KNOW. EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON BUT THAT'S WHAT A THREE YEAR THING WAS PUT IN THERE OKAY. WE PUT THAT THING IN THERE SO WHEN WE WENT TO THE VOTERS. WITH THIS. TAX INCREASE. YOU KNOW. WOULDN'T YOU KNOW NOT. WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THE MONEY WAS USED. IN THREE YEARS OR IT WASN'T. IT HAD TO BE REVERTED. SO THAT WERE THERE WOULD BE. SOME KIND OF CONTROL ON THE MONEY OKAY. SO WHEN WHEN. WHEN I STARTED THIS PROCESS FLEISCHER ACTUALLY DO BILL I DID A BILL AND WENT THROUGH THE COMMITTEE AND THEN. YOU KNOW PEOPLE SO ALL WOMEN IT YOU KNOW AND I SAID WELL WHAT IF YOU KNOW. WHERE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY GOT? UPSET WHEN I DID THE BILL BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO DO TRANSPARENCY BUILDING GOT EVERYBODY. UPSET SO THEN I. I SAID OH WILL WHY DON'T I JUST DO AN AUDIT WILL FIND OUT WHAT THE FACTS ARE FIRST. BOTH FOR. WE DO A BILL. AND SO NOW WE HAVE THE ON IT NOW. THIS IS WHERE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE WE. LOOK INTO IT WE HAVE THIS AUDIT. AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THERE IS THERE IS SOME. EFFICIENCIES THAT WE HAVE TO CORRECT. WITH THIS EXPENDITURE MONEY. WE HAD THE RIVERS AND THREE YEAR ROLL AND IT'S NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. IT'S. WE NEED TO ESTABLISH ALTHOUGH THE STRUCTURE SO WE CAN DO THAT. AND THAT'S WHO WE NEED TO DO AND I THINK WERE RINGING NOW. THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE. AND I WANT TO CORRECT. ANYBODY THAT THINKS OTHERWISE WE ARE CORRECTING THAT PROBLEM. IS THAT NOT TRUE. FOR THE PANELISTS. NOBODY'S SAYING ANYTHING. FOR THE RECORD WHERE CORRECTING IT. OKAY WE GOT THAT PROBLEM CORRECTED. SO I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE GETTING THAT PROBLEM CORRECTED BECAUSE WHEN I STARTED THAT PROCESS. WELL LAST YEAR IT WAS LIKE WELL WE DON'T WANT YOU KNOW WHEN NO ONE IF WE DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THIS JIM WE DON'T WANNA WE DON'T WANNA. GET A THIS IS A MESSY THINK SO WE HAVE WE HAVE NOW A UNANSWERED HERE WITH THIS AUDIT. THAT WE'RE GOING TO CORRECT IT. THEN THERE'S THAT THEN THERE'S THE PROCEDURES AND THE. THE THE PROCESS FOR MAKING SURE. LIKE I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHEN I HAD THAT. DISCUSSION DURING THE CAMPAIGN FOR PROP SIXTY THREE THAT THE MONEY WAS GOING TO BE SPENT. TIMELY. AND WE HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY. ON THIS MONEY BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY. I THINK THAT WE DON'T. WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE PUBLIC ACTUALLY GETS OF THE ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES? SOMEBODY I SOMEONE STATES A TWELVE PERCENT. IT'S IS IS CREDIBLY LOW NUMBER. IN THE FIRST PLACE. RIDICULOUSLY LOW. THAT THE ADEQUATE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND SO LIKE NOT SPENDING MONEY ON THAT. THAT. PARTICULAR AREA. AND HAVING ITS RESERVES. IS TO ME KIND OF A MISTER CHAIRMAN PRIVATE PROBLEM. THEY'RE HAVING THIS RESERVES. AND A AND AND IT'S KINDA LIKE WE'RE NOT SPEND THE MONEY BUT WE HAVE THIS URGENCY OKAY. SO I I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A ROBUST. MAYBE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE RESERVE SHOULD BE WHAT. LEVEL THAT. SHOULD BE THERE'S A DIS. THINK. DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ABOUT US. NOW THE FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT SHOULD THE RESERVE LEVEL BE. AND DO WE HAVE. NORMALLY. A RESERVE FOR. OF FUND. OR SHOULD WE NOT ESTABLISH RESERVES. FOR A COUNTY SHOULD THE COUNTY NOT DETERMINE WHAT THE RESERVE IS FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH. PROGRAM. SO IT USUALLY IS THAT YOU ESTABLISH A RESERVE FOR. THE PROGRAM IF IT'S AN ONGOING PROGRAM. AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE MONEY FROM ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT PLACES. RATHER THAN JUST RESERVES FOR THE OF PARTICULAR FUNDS SO. WHAT WOULD THE OPINION OF PEOPLE HERE THIS PANEL BE ABOUT WHAT LEVEL RESERVE SHOULD WE HAVE? AND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE WITH THE AUDITOR CORRECT. SO WE NEED OF GET THAT CLEARED UP SO I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT QUESTION. WHAT RESERVE SHOULD WE HAVE FOR THESE? SO AND I THINK SENATOR THAT IS. ONE OF THE KEY CRITICAL. ITEMS THAT WERE WORKING THROUGH AS BOTH THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE AUDIT AS WELL AS. WE TRY TO WORK IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH BOTH THE LA SEE AS WELL AS THE COUNTIES. SO WE HAVE AND WE HAD RETAINED OUTSIDE. EXPERTISE TO HELP US DETERMINE THE LEVEL THAT WE HAD COME UP WITH I THINK THE AUDITOR HAD A DIFFERENT LEVEL I KNOW THAT THE COUNTIES. HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD PERCEIVE AS A APPROPRIATE. AND IF PRUDENT RESERVE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY OF US HAVE. AS OF YET SAT DOWN AND COME TO A MEETING OF THE MINDS I KNOW THAT WE. LIKE I SAID AND. GIVEN THE VOLATILITY OF BOTH THE FUND AND OUR OVERALL STATE ECONOMY AND NOT WANTING TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS LOSING SERVICE AT THE SAME TIME WHEN THERE'S A RECESSION I THINK WE. TEND TO BE MORE. CONSERVATIVE IN WANTING A BIGGER RESERVE BUT I THINK. I'M TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN REACH CONSENSUS WITH THE A COUNTIES ON WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESERVE WE WOULD PUT THAT INTO THE FISCAL REGULATIONSTHAT WE ARE WORKING ON AS. EVIDENCE STIR. RECOMMENDED IN THE AUDIT SOLUTION RECOMMENDATION ON RESERVE IT'S BETWEEN SIXTY THREE AND EIGHTY. XTC THREE AND EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE ANNUAL ALLOCATION THAT IT COUNTY RECEIVE SO TO MAKE THE MATH EASY IF I GOT A MILLION DOLLARS WE WOULD SAY YOU NEED TO HAVE. BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED ANDTHIRTY OR SIX HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND AND EIGHTY THREE YEAR INTERN THIRTY THOUSAND. IN A RESERVE. YOU KNOW THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO HOLD ONTO SAID MAKE THE MATTER NIGHT OF. PERHAPS IF I CAN HAVE THE STATE AUDITOR. GIVE THEIR RECOMMENDATION. WHAT WAS THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS WE GET I JUST TO? GIVE THE RANGE OF THE DIFFERENCE IF I COULD MET MISTER CHAIRMAN SHORT QUESTION. WHAT WHAT LEVEL WITH THE STATE AUDITOR RECOMMEND BASED ON THEIR STUDY? FOR A RESERVE. SO I CAN THINK OF THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE RECORD JOHN BUYER THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. WE WE LOOKED AT THE FLUCTUATION AND IN THE MIDDLE SERVICES REVENUES FROM YEAR TO YEAR OVER THE PAST TEN YEAR PERIOD. AND WE LOOKED AT THAT THE LARGEST DECLINE IN ANY ONE YEAR AS THAT THE AS LIKELY THEM THE MOST I RESERVE COULD BE. THAT LARGEST DECLINE IN ANY ONE YEAR WAS THIRTY THREE PERCENT. THE IN THE END THE AVERAGE OF THOSE DECLINES OVER THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD UP OF THE CLIENTS THEMSELVES. WAS TWENTY THREE PERCENT SWEET WE PAID A RANGE BETWEEN TWENTY THREE. PERCENT AND THIRTY THREE PERCENT. OKAY SO. SO YOU HAD A MILLION DOLLARS HOW MUCH WOULD THAT BE COMPLETELY DEALER TO WHAT A TWO. TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND OR THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND. DELEGATES THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE. OKAY IT START THINK I THINK I'M THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THIS IS A KEY DISCUSSION. YOU KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT RESERVE LEVELS SHOULD BE. AND WHAT I'D LIKE JUST ADD SENATOR IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS AT MONEY THAT'S PUT INTO RESERVE IS NOT NECESSARILY SUBJECT TO REVERSION. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT. A LOCAL ENTITIES ARE PUTTING MONEY INTO RESERVE AND NOT SPENDING IT THAT MONEY IS NOT GONNA REVERT BACK TO THE STATE FOR REALLOCATION TO OTHER COUNTIES. THE OTHER THING WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT IS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FIFTY NINE ENTITIES THAT HAVE. THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IS PROGRAM WE WE IDENTIFIED FORTY SIX. THAT DID NOT HAVE FUNDS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO REVERSION. BACK IN OF AT THE END OF TWENTY SIX STEAM DOT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN SO THERE ARE COUNTIES AND ENTITIES OUT THERE. THAT ARE USING THESE FUNDS COULD USE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO THE REASON WE THINK HAVING THE APPROPRIATE RESERVE AMOUNT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IS. SO THERE IS AN EXCESSIVE RESERVES AT CERTAIN COUNTIES WERE OTHER COUNTIES COULD USE THOSE FUNDS TO GET. OUR MONEY OUT THERE AND PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR INDIVIDUALS IN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. SO THAT'S WHY WE DID AN ANALYSIS WE THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR LOOKING AT A TEN YEAR WINDOW. ARE AND SAYING WHAT WAS THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OVER THOSE TEN YEARS AS MR BUYER INDICATORS ABOUT THIRTY THREE PERCENT. SO WE SAID BASED ON THIRTY THREE PERCENT HOW MUCH OF A TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION. WOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE. AND IT WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION BECAUSE THERE'S FIVE AND THIRTY FIVE AND RESERVES. THERE WERE ABOUT ABOUT ANOTHER HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD OF RE ALLOCATED TO THOSE FORTY SIX COUNTIES. THE DIDN'T HAVE MONEY THAT WAS SUBJECT TO REVERSION TO THE EXTENT THEY NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PROVIDE SERVICES SO THIS IS AS YOU INDICATED. A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO NEEDS TO RESOLVE SO IF I ESTABLISHED AND INVITE COULD MISTER TERRIFIED ESTABLISH A RESERVE. A RESERVE I SAID OKAY EACH. IS THE RESERVE FOR EACH COUNTY OR IS IT A STATEWIDE RESERVE. YOU'D BE A RESERVE LEVELS AT EACH COUNTY WOULD WOULD USE WOULD FALL SOVIET STEPS TO RESERVE LEVEL THIRTY THREE PERCENT. EACH COUNTY COULD HAVE UP TO THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF ITS PRIOR YEAR REVENUES IN THAT OF THAT ERICA. AND SO IF IT WAS A THIRTY THREE PERCENT LEVEL. THAT. SAY. I PUT THE MONEY IN. SAY HAVE A GOOD YEAR AND THERE'S A LOT OF. LOT OF MILLIONAIRES THAT WE CAN TAX AND. WHATEVER YOU KNOW WE TAX AND I'M. AND THAT A YOU CAN PUT ALL THE MONEY IN A GOOD YEAR YOU CAN PUT THE MONEY INTO RESERVE. THAT RESERVE WILL STAY THERE. AND IF THE REVENUE DECLINES IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS YOU STILL HAVE THAT RESERVE IN AN ACCOUNT RIGHT THAT MY CORRECT. SO SO. IS NOT AN ANNUAL AMOUNT YOU HAVE TO SET ASIDE IT IT'S NOT IT JUST AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SPEND IT OF COURSE GREG. IT'S LIKE A RAINY DAY FUND KIND OF THING. LIKE WE HAVE IN OUR BUDGET REQUIREMENT BUDGET REQUIRES US TO HAVE A. RAINY DAY FUND BUT THIS IS. SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO SPEND MONEY ON PROGRAMS. NOW IF YOU HAD. IF YOU LOOK AT OVER FIVE YEARS. AND YOU SAY OKAY HERE'S HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE GONNA SPEND OVER FIVE YEARS. AND FOR FIVE STRAIGHT YEARS YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE USE OF THAT RESERVE. HOW MUCH? OF THE. FIVE YEAR ALLOCATION WOULD BE. USED FOR RESERVE. IT WON'T BE A A WOULD BE THAT MUCH CORRECT. BUT IF. YEAH IF. IF THERE WAS NO NEED TO DRAW DOWN THE RESERVE TO IF YOU QUITE YEAH YES IF YOUR QUESTION IS THAT. THAT THEIR REVENUES WERE SUFFICIENT AND ALL FIVE YEARS OVER IT FOR FOR THE PLAN FOR THE FOUR OF THEM BY THE PROGRAM IN THE FUNDING THAT YOU. HAD PLANNED FOR THEN YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO TOUCH THOSE RESERVES THEY WOULD STAY THERE. NOW THE COUNTY'S. DON'T TO SPEND THAT MONEY ON ONGOING SERVICES THEY SPEND IT ON ONE TIME SERVICES AS WELL RIGHT. CORRECT THERE'S MONEY SPENT ON CAPITOL OTHER KINDS OF. AND IF YOU HAD A BAD YEAR YOU JUST DON'T SPEND THE MONEY ON A CAPITAL PROJECT BUT YOU CAN CONTINUE SPENDING. MONEY ON THE A ONGOING PROJECT IS THAT CORRECT. SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF REDUCING YOUR EXPENDITURES BY. DEFERRING OR SPREADING OUT THE COST OF THE. CITY A CAPITAL PROJECT THAT YOU WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY ON. WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW WE'D HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LIST OF CAPITAL PROJECTS. SO IS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO REGULATE THE FLOW OF THE CASH. AND PROTECT A RESERVE. IT IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE. OKAY SO OUT MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK. I THINK. THE RESERVE. POLICY. TO ME IT'S ONE OF THE CENTRAL POINTS OF THIS AUDIT. AND AND AND BECAUSE IF WE SET THE RESERVE TO HIGH. IT WILL RESULT IN MONEY THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED. NOT BEING SPENT ON THE PURPOSE OF WHICH THE VOTERS DECIDE AND WHAT THE MONEY FOR. SO THAT'S. TO MEET TO ME THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT REAL REAL THING. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT SETTING THE RESERVE. TOO HIGH. AND I THINK THERE HAS TO BE POLICIES A BACKUP TO RESERVE AND BACK UP THE EXPENDITURES AND THOSE POLICIES RECOMMENDED BY THE AUTHOR I THINK THE DEPARTMENT AGREED TO THOSE RIGHT IS THAT CORRECT. SO NOW WE WE DISAGREE ON THE AMOUNT OF THE RESERVE BUT I THINK I WAS I WAS ONE AREA BUT NO OTHER AREAS THERE WASN'T TOO MANY OTHERS YOU DISAGREED WITH RIGHT. NO THE TIMING OF THE FISCAL REGULATIONS SO THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF. BETWEEN US BUT. AND TO AND THEN. AND THEN WE HAD SOME CLARIFICATION ON A FORMER APPROPRIATION. THAT WAS I STILL A CARRYOVER WITH THE STING OF LITTLE ENOUGH TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS YEAH IT'S. LIKE HAVING A. AND THIS IS MY NON SCHOOL WAY OF EXPLAINING AT IS LIKE HAVING AN OPEN CHECKING ACCOUNT WITH NO MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT SO THE. THAT IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS A TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE APPROPRIATION BUT THAT'S THE APPROPRIATION LIMIT BUT THERE WAS ACTION NUMB MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT SO. OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WORK WITH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS CLOSE DOWN BUT YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO ACTUAL MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT. KNOW THERE STILL EXISTS DISAGREEMENT IT IF I MODEL AIRPLANE ON. THE TOWARD WILL HARDLY THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. SENT CENTER FROM A CLARIFY AT. THE AT THAT CONCLUSION THE AUDIT THE DEPARTMENT DID DID SHOW US THAT A DOCUMENT THAT THE THAT THE CONTROLLER HAD ADJUSTED THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND HAVE THAT AMENDMENT SITTING THERE FOR FOR OVER FIVE YEARS THE DEPARTMENT STAFFER WE SIMPLY RECONCILE BETWEEN THEIR RECORDS AND THOSE THE STATE CONTROLLER SAYING THAT THE MONEY EXISTED. IT'D BEEN SHOWING UP IN THE STATE'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD. OUR REVIEW IDENTIFIED THE AMOUNT OF WHEN WE ASK THE DEPARTMENT WHY THE STATE COMPTROLLER JUST OF THAT AMOUNT OUT. THAT HARPER COULDN'T PROVIDE US AN ANSWER WE ASKED FOR A CONTACT NAME OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THAT WE CAN TALK TO. THAT HARM WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE SOME AND AN ANSWER AND THIS WASN'T JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE IN YOUR FALL OF RESPONSIBILITY WHEN YOU WRITE FOLLOW UP THE AUDIT YOU GO KEEP WORKING ON THAT TO YOU. YOU REACH A DEAD END OUR GUESTS YOU WANT TO SET THAT WAY. RIGHT AND SEWER AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE AT THE SIX TODAY RESPONSE OF WHAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN SHOW US. THAT THE ADJUSTMENT WAS CORRECT TO DO. OKAY THANK YOU CLOSE FAMILY. SARAH MARLA. I THINK MISTER CHAIR THIS MORNING THERE WAS AN ARTICLE. OF THAT FOLLOWED UP ON IT WOULD TIMES. COLUMN BY THE BUSINESS PAGE COLUMNIST. THAT CALPERS AND HIRED A NEW CFO THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE RESUME AND THEREFORE YOU SHOULD CONTACT THE MEMBERS OF THE. I PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT COMMITTEE. SENATOR PANTS INNER MORAL I CAN SO. I AM SO EVERYBODY SORT OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE ON A COMMITTEE THEN YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING. THE WHOLE SHOW AND SO. THAT'S THE KIND OF LIFE WERE LIVING AS LEGISLATORS. SOME IS CAN IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE TODAY ACT I. I YOU KNOW WE DON'T GET MUCH CHANCE WERE WERE LEGISLATORS THAT EXECUTIVES BUT WERE SOMEHOW HELL TO AN EXECUTIVE. SOMEHOW RESPONSIBILITY SO GOVERNMENT KIND OF FUN. HAVING BEEN HERE IN THIS ARENA FOR TWO DECADES I CAME OUT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR'S APARTMENT CPA FIRM SO I GET. YOU KNOW I COULD WRITE THE CHECKS AND I COULD YOU KNOW DO EVERYTHING RIGHT AWAY. SO. YOU KNOW YOU SEE IT SO YOUR YOUR YOUR REALIZE YOU'RE IN A NON COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT SO THERE'S MAYBE NOT. A I'LL A REASON LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDERS TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S GOING AS QUICKLY TO PROBABLY AS AS YOUR COMPETITORS ARE GOING. BUT THERE'S ALSO THE SENSE OF BEING A TEAM BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PICK ON EACH OTHER WHEN THINGS OR DISCOVERED WHEN IT'S TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. IMPROVE THINGS SO THAT WITH THIS THIS FUND BALANCE WE'VE HAD. PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE YOU KNOW APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR SO WE ARE TALKING MORE THAN A DECADE AGO. ARE THAT IT WAS APPROVED AND AND NOW I GET THIS REPORT AND. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT IT'S NOT PLEASANT IT SAYS DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES WITH REGARDS TO OVERSIGHT. WORDS LIKE INEFFECTIVE AND. MINIMAL AND IN I GO THROUGH THE KEY FINDINGS AND HAS NOT. PROVIDED EFFECTIVE DIRECTION NOT DEVELOP THE PROCESS FOR RECOVERING FUNDS. I HAD NO GUIDANCE IN HOW LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AGENCY SHOULD TREAT INTEREST. INADEQUATELY OVERSEAS THE FUNDS. THAT LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES RECEIVE IT HAS I'VE FORCED REPORTING TAKE QUITE DEADLINES MUSES. THAT IS FRUSTRATING AS A AS A. AN EXECUTIVE LEGISLATOR AND I'M. I'M I'M I'M JUST WANNA KNOW YOU KNOW THE COUNTY WOULD START IMPLEMENTING MAJOR STRUCTURAL CHANGES WHAT. WHAT ARE WE DOING AT THE STATE LEVEL WHAT WE DO IS A HATE? WE WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT THIS IT'S THE TIME MAYBE THIRD TIME. WHAT WE DO AT YOUR LEVEL TO? IT SURE THAT TAXPAYERS WITH SPECIAL THE ONES ARE PAYING. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS OF TAXABLE INCOME. NOT THEIR MONEY IS BEING USED. IT'S YOU KNOW APPROPRIATELY WHAT I THOUGHT. I'M HERE THIS IS THE MOMENT IN TIME I JUST LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT HEAD. WHAT DO YOU DO WHAT'S GOING ON IN? SURE SO AND YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF THINGS AND SO WE HAVE A. LOT OF WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE SINCE WE. TOOK OVER THE OVERSIGHT. SO THIS WAS A DEPARTMENTS. FUNCTION THAT CAME TO US IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. AND IT HAS CHANGED A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT TIMES RIGHT THE INITIATIVE AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY PASSED BY THE VOTERS HAS BEEN MODIFIED. A COUPLE TIMES UNDER THE FORMER DEPARTMENT THAT ADMINISTERED IT IT USED TO BE THAT THE STATE HELD THE FUNDS AND THE COUNTY HAD TO COME. AND GET THE FUNDS ALLOCATED TO IT AND THEN THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT. SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THAT WHERE THE COUNTY SAID THIS IS. NOT AS FLEXIBLE AS WE NEED IT TO BE INSIDE THE INITIATIVE WAS CHANGED TO SAY THE FUNDS FUND FROM THE TAX GO STRAIGHT TO THE COUNTIES AND THEN THERE WAS AN OVERSIGHT. CHANGE I AM I THINK YOU KNOW YOU SAY IT. REALLY WELL AND THAT WE HAVE A REALLY BIG DEPARTMENT ITH A LOT OF COMPLICATED. PIECES A LOT OF. OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS BOTH AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL WE WELCOME. OVERSIGHT I WILL ALWAYS SAY THAT THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT BOTH IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA AS WELL AS IN OTHER PARTS OF OUR DEPARTMENT. I THINK WE HAVE BEEN. WORKING REALLY DILIGENTLY WITH THE COUNTIES TO ISSUE GUIDANCE ON BOTH THE PROGRAMMATIC. IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS. ACT AS WELL AS OTHER PIECES OF THE MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM SO I I JUST WANT TO. REMIND YOU THAT. THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IS ONE COMPONENT OF A MUCH BROADER MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM SO WHEN WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES AROUND GUIDANCE WERE NOT ONLY LOOKING TO THEM AROUND MHSAA BUT WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THEM AS IT PERTAINS TO MEDI CAL. BOTH PEDIATRIC AND ADULT POPULATIONS AND SO I THINK THESE REGULATIONS HAVE TAKEN AWHILE THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER. KIND OF FUN PRESSING EITHER ISSUES THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER. WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE COUNTIES AROUND RECONCILIATIONS AND SO I JUST. I'M NOT MAKING. NECESSARILY EXCUSES I'M JUST SAYING IT IS A REALLY BIG. COMPLEMENT IN WHICH WE WORK. YOU KNOW REALLY WELL WITH FIFTY SIX DIFFERENT COUNTIES BUT WE WORKED FIFTY SIX DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND SO I THINK THE AUDIT RAISED. FAIR POINTS WE ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT THOSE ARE WE ARE WORKING TO MEET THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS WE. I AGREE WITH THEM IN THE AUDIT AND I THINK. EITHER THE ONLY AT THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS WE ALSO GIVEN LIMITED RESOURCES WITHIN A STATE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE. YOU'LL NEVER HAVE AND YOU KNOW THIS COMING FROM AYE AYE COUNTY THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO. A WHOLE HUNDRED PERCENT AND SO WE ALSO TRY TO TARGET OUR LIMITED RESOURCES TO THE AREAS THAT WE THINK. ARE HIGHEST RISK. IMAGE TO SAY. THERE HAS NOT EVER BEEN AN ALLEGATION WHERE THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN USED INAPPROPRIATELY AND SO I REALLY WANT TO STRESS THAT AS WELL IS THAT WE ARE IN A PLACE WHERE THE COUNTIES. HAVE NOT USED FUNDS. AS QUICKLY AS WE WANTED THEM TO WE ARE WORKING TO SOLVE THAT. BUT I THINK WE ALSO AS A DEPARTMENT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PROGRAM INTEGRITY WE HAVE ALSO FOCUSED IN AREAS WHERE WE HAD OTHER MORE HIGHER PRIORITY ISSUES AROUND PROGRAM INTEGRITY SO I JUST. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE NOT AN EXECUTIVE AS YOU STATED I'M. I HAVE I WORK WITH AS MUCH AS I'M CAPACITY AS I HAVE AT THE TIME AND WE TARGET THE HIGHEST EITHER NEED OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY AND THIS IS DEFINITELY. A PRIORITY BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS. HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON IT AS THE YEARS HAVE. AS WE HAVE HAD IT SINCE IT CAME TO US IN TWENTY TWELVE SO PROP SIXTY THREE DID IT A PROVIDE A AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMPONENT. STRIKE ONE PERCENT OR TWO PERCENT OR FIVE PERCENT OF THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR ADMINISTRATION THAT'S RIGHT. SO THEN WHO DO YOU HAVE A MHSAA DIRECTOR THAT OVERSEES THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES NO SO I HAVE GOING ON. NEW. I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH YOUR RIGHT RESPONSE AND WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE RESOURCE RIGHT. SO WE HAVE. WE HAVE RECEIVE STAFF IN THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME TO DO PROGRAM AUDITS SO THOSE POSITIONS CAME TO US LAST YEAR. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SO THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAD. RESOURCES ALLOCATED TO. LOOK AT THE PROGRAMMATIC FUNCTIONS OF MHSAA WE HAVE. MAYBE TWELVE OR THIRTEEN STAFF TOTAL THAT OUR IMAGE IT'S A FUNDED WITHIN A DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE STAFF THAT HANDLE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT JUST MHSAA. SPECIFIC SO I HAVE CERTAIN FISCAL EXPERTS THAT NOT ONLY HELP ON THE EPS DUTY AND SO WE USE. STAFF ACROSS MULTIPLE PROGRAMS BUT SPECIFICALLY FUNDED ON MHSAA IT'S A FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER OF STAFF AND THAT'S PUBLIC TWELVE OR THIRTEEN AND A DEPARTMENT OF FOR THOUSANDS. BUT THAT'S A KEY FUNDING SOURCE AND IT WOULDN'T BE A KEY MANAGER AND YOURS. ORG CHART. WELL IT'S A IT'S A FUNDING SOURCE IN MY DEPARTMENT IT'S ABOUT TWO AND A HALF THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN A. STATEWIDE OPERATIONS BUDGET OF OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION. BUT YOU HAVE AN EXPENDITURE HAD THE RESOURCES THAT. I'M HAVING TROUBLE DEAR DIGESTING THAT SO SO YOU'VE HAD IT FOR A FEW YEARS WHERE IS THE STRATEGIC PLAN. SO WHEN YOU SAY SO WE SO THE SO THE INITIATIVE DOESN'T CALL NECESSARILY FOR US TO HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN I THINK WE WORK WITH THE COMMISSION IN TERMS OF. HELPING SET POLICY AROUND WHAT THE COUNTIES CAN USE THEIR MHSAA FUNDING FOR BUT THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR ME TO SAY THAT WE AS A DEPARTMENT ARE. EITHER CHARGED WITH I THINK THAT. WE WORK. BOTH WITH LEGISLATORS AND OTHERS TO HELP SET. GUIDANCE AROUND CERTAIN INITIATIVES BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE HAVE. SO. A MY WORDS. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT. A COMPONENT OF YOUR OPERATION THAT SORTA LIKE A RENTAL IS BOAT WHICH IS KINDA JUST. FLOATING THERE AND I'M. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW THAT EVEN HAPPENS. I'M SO THERE'S BEEN THIS CONCERN ABOUT LACK OF LEADERSHIP. SO. IT THAT'S I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION MR CHARITY. WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO LEGISLATION TO TELL YOU TO FIND A LEADER AND TO DO A STRATEGIC PLAN WHY ISN'T THAT JUST? YOU KNOW DEBT JUST COMES FROM MANAGEMENT WHAT AND WHY IS THAT JUST. WISEMAN BEEN THERE. SO A COUPLE THINGS. I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE RUDDERLESS I WOULD CHALLENGE THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WE HAVE. HAD PROGRAMMATIC GUIDANCE OUT TO THE COUNTIES. ON THE IMAGE TO SAY FUNDING WE HAVE AYE REGULATIONS WE HAVE CERTAIN GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS. I THINK WHAT WE ALSO. THERE'S A CAREFUL BALANCE BECAUSE THE INITIATIVE. AS WAS MENTIONED IN A PREVIOUS PANEL IT WAS INTENDED AND CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO MAKE IT A LOCAL DECISION. A LOCALLY APPROVED AND THE LOCALLY DETERMINES ALLOCATION PROCESS SO I THINK THAT THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN INHERENT TENSION. BETWEEN. THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES FOR WHICH THEY ARE. SETTING THEIR OWN BUDGETS THEY'RE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE WORKING WITH THEIR PLANNING. COUNCILS ARE WORKING WITH THEIR LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND IT IS A GROUND UP EXPENDITURE AND A AND A GROUND UP. DRIVEN MECHANISM AND SO I THINK WE ARE NOT AS THE STATE AUTHORIZED OR OTHERWISE ALLOWED TO COME IN AND SO THAT'S ALSO BEEN ATTENTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRY WE'VE TRIED TO BE RESPECTFUL I THINK OF HOW THE INITIATIVE WAS DRAFTED AND WE DO NOT. EXCEED OUR THIRTY I'M IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE NOT BEEN OTHERWISE AUTHORIZED I THINK THAT'S ALSO WHAT WE TRY TO BE MINDFUL THAT. JANET NGUYEN CLOSING. WE HAVE A STATE LIBRARIAN AND I SEE HIM ALL OVER THE STATE. HELPING COUNTIES WITH THEIR LIBRARIES I I WOULD SAY THAT YOU MIGHT WANNA LOOK AT THAT MODEL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS CAMP THANK YOU MISTER. THEN SOMEONE MONROVIA HIGH AT THANK YOU TOM AYE EXCEEDS WHAT FOLLOW UP ON SOMETHING THAT. SIR BELL SAID SO ABOUT THE RESERVE. AND SO IS HE RELAYED HISTORY OF THE INITIATIVE HE SAID DEL THE ATTENTION VERY MUCH WAS THAT. WE WILL GET THE MONEY OUT IF YOU DON'T. THERE'S BEEN ACTUALLY ALLOCATING GET THE MONEY OUT THIS GUY REFER TO AND. BE ADDED RETURN TO THE POLL WE GET THAT OUT. THAT I WOULD HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU DESERVE BUT THE PART THE PART OF THE QUESTION THAT I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT HE BROUGHT UP IS IS THAT. SHOULD THE RESERVE. BE. JUST A RESERVE FOR EACH COUNTY OR SHOULD IT BE SPECIFICALLY ALLOCATED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS BECAUSE I CAN SEE YES WITH A VAULT HOUSE. UP AND DOWN. THAT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SUSTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL FUNDING FOR A PROJECT YOU MAY NEED A RESERVE FOR A PROJECT BUT JUST TO HOLD THE MONEY INTO A POT. AND NOT ACTUALLY HAVE IT ALLOCATED AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF THE TENSION THREE YEARS THEN WITHIN THREE YEARS YOU GAIN THE MONEY YOU NEED TO SIGN AT THE SOMETHING. AND MAYBE A ROUTE YOU KNOW MAY NOT BE SEATS THAT'S RIGHT SENT OUT RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT'S VOLATILE YOU TRY BUT. AT LEAST YOU'RE DESIGNATING IT FOR SOMETHING YOU'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON. BUT. PERHAPS MAKE SOME SENSE. IN TERMS OF JUST AS THEY'RE SAYING WE HAVE A RESERVIST CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF. ALL THE MONEY WE THAT IS JUST IN THIS GENERIC POT THAT IS ALL THAT FITS PROP SIXTY THREE WE CAN JUST HOLD ITS CASH AND YOU DON'T HAVE THAT YOU DECIDE WE WILL SPEND IT ON. WITHIN THOSE A THREE APPEARED OF YOU RECEIVING AT. SO I AS I'M HEARING THE HISTORY PERHAPS SOME WEAKENED PERHAPS WE CAN GET THE COMMENT FROM THE AUDITOR'S AND THAT I MAY SAY AND AND AND BE EIGHT CS ABOUT SAYING THAT IF YOU GOT IMPORTANT IF YOU GO PUT MONEY AWAY. NOW YOU HAVE THREE YEARS DECIDED WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN A WAY FOR INSIDIOUS LEVY AND SOME GENERIC ACCOUNT POOL SAYS. PROP SIXTY THREE WHATEVER WE DECIDE YEARS LATER ON THAT WE WANT TO SPEND IT ON LATER. IT'S THAT SAYING THAT INTENT IS IS THAT SPEND IT DESIGNATED AND I GET THE IDEA IS NOW THE BIG THE DATED THEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE AN INTENTION WE'VE SPENDING IT ON. SO BECAUSE HE BROUGHT THAT UP EARLIER YELLS IT AND PUT IT FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMMERS EFFORT. GENERICALLY FOR JUST IN A POT. THANK YOU SENATOR PENN HAD TO BE DOING WITH THE COMMISSION. S. HAS THE SENATOR SAID THE INTENT OF THE ACT WAS TO INFUSE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO MEET UNMET NEEDS RIGHT AT THE VERY VERY CLEARLY THE INTENT IS TO MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO BE SPENT. RIGHT IT'S ALSO RECOGNITION THAT. THAT COUNTIES CAN AND SHOULD SET ASIDE AN AMOUNT FOR PRUDENT TRIED AND SO YOU'RE GETTING AT THE ISSUE OF WHAT'S A PRINT LEVEL. I THINK THE KEY IN THE COMMISSION IS I'M NOT APPROACHING THIS FROM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT'S THE RIGHT PERCENT TRY THE COMMISSION REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS HAVE. YOU KNOW IS THIS A DECISION THAT COMPETITIVE MUNITY HAS ACTUALLY INFORMED AND MAY RIGHT TO THE EXTENT THAT. THEY TAKE A COUNTY IS DECIDING NOT TO SPEND FUNDS. TO WITH HOLD THEM FOR FUTURE USES IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE ARE DYING IN THE STREETS. THEN RIGHT THEN THAT'S A DECISION THAT THE OTHER THE QUESTION HERE IS WHAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON THIS FRONT A PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY RIGHT AND THERE MAY BE SOME COUNTIES. THAT THROUGH ALL THIS PROCES THEY'VE DECIDED TO MAKE THAT CHOICE I DON'T THINK THAT BE THE CHOICE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO COUNTY TO MAKE. THEM AT BUT WE'VE REALLY TRIED TO FOCUS ON IN SO THE INFORMED CONSENT SIDE OF THE DECISION AROUND WHAT IS PRUDENT FORBES ARE FORGIVEN COUNTY. THE REASON THAT THE WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS ACTUALLY VERY CHALLENGING. IS THAT THE MHS SAY IS ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT OF OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS IN A GIVEN YEAR BUT IN SOME COUNTIES THAT MAKES UP FORTY TWO OR FORTY FIVE OR EVEN FIFTY PERCENT. RIGHT AND THE FUNDS ARE REALLY BLENDED AND SO THERE MAY BE SOME PROJECTS WHERE YOU COULD SET ASIDE A PORTION OF DOLLARS FOR RESERVE. BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE MONEY IS BLENDED TO REALLY TRACK THE DOLLARS SEPARATE FROM YOUR OVERALL SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY I THINK THAT. THE SORT OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY IS TO IS TO CALL FOR THIS PROBLEM OF RESERVE. BUT I DO WANT TO SUGGEST THAT WHAT HASN'T REALLY BEEN ON THE TABLE IN THE CONVERSATION IS THE OTHER FUNDS. THE FEDERAL SHARE REALIGNMENT THE NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT IN THE TWENTY TWELVE REALIGNMENT RIGHT BECAUSE IT CAN IN IN TERMS OF WHAT IS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE FOR. MITIGATING DOWNTURNS IN THE ECONOMY RIGHT AND SO WE WERE SO FOCUSED ON THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS THE MHSAA MUCH OF THEM AS A RESERVE BE. IT AND SO YOU KNOW I I WANT TO PUT ON THE TABLE WHAT IS PRUDENT IF YOU'RE EXPECTING THE MHS SAY TO TO CUSHION A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY NOT JUST FOR THE IMAGE TO SAY BUT ALSO REALIGNMENT ONE REALIGNMENT TO. AND AND THAT'S YOUR ABILITY TO DROUGHT ON FEDERAL MONEY SO IS IT SO. NINTH I THINK THE CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT A BIT MORE IN TERMS OF THE LARGER PART OF FUNDS THESE ROUGHLY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH NOT JUST THE TWO. THAT IS MHSAA AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE WAY IN WHICH THE FUNDING FUNDING IS USED. IT'S RARELY THAT THIS PROGRAM ISN'T MUCH TO SAY FUNDED AND THESE ONES ARE NOT. TYPICALLY IT'S THESE OF THE DOLLARS AND AS YOU HEARD MANY THE COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING TO SAY. I'M YOU KNOW WHAT CAN I BUILD FOR AND THAT THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO OFFER VERSES WHAT PEOPLE NEED. AND HAD A WIDE AND HOW THE WHITE DESIGN MY SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO PEOPLE'S NEEDS ARE AND THEN FULLY LEVERAGE ALL OF THE FUNDING STREAMS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THAT NEED BASED STRATEGY. WHEN. I MEAN. TOBY SAID IT REALLY WELL I THINK THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT WE WOULD SAY IS. YOU KNOW LEGISLATURE'S. AT LEAST TWO IF NOT THREE TIMES HAS MODIFIED THE INITIATIVE. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU. TO THE CA.GOV SO YOU BUT THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO HAVE A MORE DELIBERATE. DIRECTIVE TO THE COUNTIES ON EITHER THE USE OF THE FUNDS ARE THE RESERVE AND THAT IS NOT OTHERWISE EITHER CONTEMPLATED CONTEMPLATED OR SPECIFIED BY THE INITIATIVE. HE WOULD JUST HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE INITIATIVE WHAT AT YOU KNOW LAID OUT IN TERMS OF TWO THIRDS VOTE IN FURTHERANCE OF THE ACT. I'M SO WERE ALSO ALWAYS MINDFUL OF YOU KNOW I'M GETTING BACK TO MY. COMMENTS TO SENATOR MORLOCK IS. WE WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T OTHERWISE AND DECIDED IT THEY ENACT THE ACT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE. BE ALLOWED FOR WELL I THINK GO FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE US ARE BELLS. A HISTORY AND I THINK WE WANT TRADE RESPECT WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED FOR. AT THAT AND I THINK THE OTHER PART THOUGH IS THAT. I THINK PART OF RELEASED AND ANNOUNCED THEIR MORE LIKE ISN'T HERE AT THE MOMENT. UP BUT I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES IS THAT. WHEN A COUNTY THE SITES NOT TO SPEND SOME OF THE MONEY AND PUT IT AWAY SOMEWHERE IT'S NOT MISLEAD THE MOST PUBLIC OF DECISIONS AND NOT MISS A DEFAULT YOU KNOW PEOPLE MAY NOT JUST BE PAYING ATTENTION TO IT BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE HAVE THE RACE. SITUATION WE HAVE NOW WHERE PEOPLE TURN AROUND SAID LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY YOU HAVE. AND I'M LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM AND HEALTH ISSUES AND WHY ISN'T BEING SPENT RIGHT. AND. THAT AND THAT THAT'S THE REASON FOR TREATING THE REVERSION PROCESS AND INITIAL INITIATIVE BECAUSE I THINK THE AUTHORS WHEN THEY PUT TOGETHER. RIGHT BREAK CONCERNED ABOUT THAT'S BASED ON WHAT THEIR BELL SAID SO I WASN'T THERE. BUT I THINK IT DOES PRESENT. A LARGE CHALLENGE WHEN. BASICALLY IF YOU HAVE A POT OF MONEY IN EXCESS OF ON THE FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONER SOME. ISSUES AND I ACTUALLY ARE COMMISSION I ACTUALLY SAID WE ACTUALLY HAD A DESIGNATED. SO AND EVEN THEN PEOPLE STILL SAID LUCKY SOD THIS MONEY YOU'RE SITTING ON AND THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THE MONEY'S JUST. SITTING THERE ARE KNOW I KNOW IT'S NOT JUST SITTING THERE PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IT'S NOT. BEING YELP IF IF THERE ISN'T LIKE THIS IS THE PLAN WE HALF FOR THAT RIGHT WE NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT BECAUSE WE'RE DOING SOME CAPITAL THING WE HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT BUT. BASICALLY IT'S NOT DESIGNATED. I THINK AND IT STARTS GETTING OLDER AND OLDER AND THAT'S WHAT WE HEARD TO ANY GETS HARDER HARD TO TRACK WHAT'S HAPPENING TO IT. THEN I THINK YOU LOSE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND I THINK THAT'S THE THING. SOME OF A SERVE BOTH STRAIGHT UP BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IS ACT IS AND WHY IT'S FUNDING SO WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A LOSS OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND. AND IN THIS ACT AND THAT IT'S BEEN FOURTEEN YEARS AND. ISSUES DO COME UP ABOUT AND WHEN PEOPLE GO WILL LOOK THIS MONEY. IT'S NOT BEING SPENT IT WE HAVE THESE NEEDS WARY SITTING OUT FOR. THAT. THINK YOU. AYE AT SIT ON THE. HEALTH AND HUMAN HELP SOMEONE COMMITTEE AND. WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH MANY HEARINGS AND THIS IS THE SAME THING I KEEP HEARING OVER AND OVER AGAIN IF IT'S NOT ONE. DEPARTMENT IT'S ARE NOT ONE. ACT THAT'S ANOTHER ACT AND IT'S JUST REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR ME TO SEE THAT. YOU KNOW THE COMMENTS LIKE WE'RE NOT MISUSING THE MONEY NOT USING THE MONEY IS JUST AS BAD AS MISUSING THE MONEY IN MY OPINION BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE. AND I SAID IT DIE LAST WEEK AND MAYBE SOME OF YOU OUT WHERE THEY'RE AT THE US SUB ONE MEETING. WE CAN DISPUTE THE THE AUDITOR'S A. REPORT WE CAN DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT THE OF THE FACT THAT NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THE FOLKS THAT ARE BEING ARE NOT BEING SERVICED THAT'S MY FRUSTRATION. BAD WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT TECHNICALITIES HERE AND THERE WHERE'S THE HUMAN FACTOR IN THIS AND I SAID THE LAST WEEK AND. I'VE BEEN SITTING THROUGH THROUGH. TWICE A WEEK COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND IT'S THE SAME STORY IF IT'S NOT THIS ISSUE WITH ANOTHER ISSUE AND IT'S. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STRATEGIC PLANS IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE HAVE A ANY STRATEGIC PLANS FOR ANYTHING AND THIS IS BASED ON ME SITTING HERE THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR. THE FRUSTRATION AGAIN COMES FROM THE INABILITY TO SEE THE HUMAN FACTOR IN THIS. AGAIN WE CAN DISPUTE THE MONEY ALL WE WANT BUT THERE IS NO NOBODY THINKING. GOD THERE'S PEOPLE DYING. AND WE'RE NOT HELPING THEM. MISS USING THE MONEY IS NOT IT'S NOT. THE QUESTION IS NOT USING THE MONEY AND THAT FOR ME IS JUST AS BAD BECAUSE WE DO HAVE PEOPLE DYING ON THE STREETS AND THEN WE SIT HERE AND COMPLAIN. ABOUT. HOW MANY OF HOMELESS FOLKS WE HAVE HOW MANY MENTALLY ILL FOLKS WE HAVE AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THEN WE HAVE A POT OF MONEY THAT'S NOT BEING USED? FOR DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND. TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE PUBLIC MISTRUST IT'S THE LEGISLATIVE MISTRUST TRIED TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IN THE LAST TWO AND A HALF I HAVE NO TRUST IN THE DEPARTMENTS. BECAUSE I KEEP GETTING MISINFORMATION I KEEP GETTING. THE RUNAROUND WHEN I ASK QUESTIONS AND THEN NOW THAT. WE HAVE AN AUDIT THEN THERE'S A DISPUTE WITH THE AUDIT AND SO AT SOME POINT WHERE THE HUMAN FACTOR. ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING OR WILL WE NOT DOING FOR THE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN NEED AN ALLEY I'M AND ALLEY COUNTY. I THINK ALL OF US ARE MOST OF US ARE BUT I I BELONG IN LA COUNTY AND AND JUST TO WALK DOWN THE STREET AND SEE FOLKS THAT ARE SUFFERING AND YET LOOK AT. A AT A PILE OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE THAT'S NOT BEING USED FOR THESE PEOPLE THESE ARE REALIZE THESE ARE COMMUNITIES ARE BEING AFFECTED ORANGE COUNTY. AYE HAS A HUGE HOMELESS PROBLEM AND I GUARANTEE YOU YES THE COST OF LIVING IN THE COST OF HOUSING IS A BIG ISSUE BUT THEM THE. I VENTURE TO SAY AND I'M SURE THEIR STATISTICS THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE STREETS ARE BECAUSE THEY HAVE MENTAL ILLNESSES AND WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM AND WE'VE BEEN SITTING ON THIS MONEY FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. AS YOU CAN. TELL I AM FRUSTRATED I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID BUT I'D THE PART I DON'T AGREE WITH IS THAT. WERE WORKING ON IT EVERY SINGLE TIME I ASK A QUESTION WERE ALWAYS WORKING ON IT AND WE'RE WE'RE GONNA COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. AND YET. THIS HAS BEEN HERE. FOURTEEN YEARS PERHAPS EATING IN ITS CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES BY BOTH PLAN THE STRATEGIC BUT IF YOU HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN. NO MATTER WHAT CHANGES THE PLAN IS IN PLACE AND YOU CAN ADJUST TO TO TO. A BASED ON ON ON YOUR PLAN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN FOR ANYTHING BECAUSE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE HAVE A PLAN FOR ANYTHING ESPECIALLY IN THIS DEPARTMENT EVERY TIME I ASK A QUESTION. ON THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE AROUND AND SO JUST. THERE IS NO REAL QUESTION IT'S JUST A STATEMENT OF FRUSTRATION AND. WE KEEP GOING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I HOPE THAT AT LEAST IN THIS CASE WITH THE AUDITOR GIVING THEIR THEIR OPINION THAT WE FOLLOW THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS AND. I'M GONNA BE HERE FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS AND THIS ISSUE AND ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE NOT GONNA GO AWAY IF WE DON'T ACTIVELY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF. KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD OR OR YOU KNOW BLAMING YOU KNOW WE GOT A TWO YEARS AGO WE GOT IT THREE YEARS AGO. THAT'S JUST BLAME NOW AND THERE IS NO ACTION AND I AM FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I SEE NO ACTION WHEN I COULD ASK QUESTIONS IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF EXCUSES AND I'M TIRED OF IT. I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE SUFFERING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND SOUL. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE. YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE ARE. BE HEARING AYE. BIDE. MY SKEPTICAL. SOUTH SAID THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SITTING HERE NEXT YEAR WITH THE SAME ISSUES AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE AND I HOPE IT IS AND I'M HOPE I'M WRONG. BUT I HOPE THAT THE AUDITOR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEXT YEAR WE CAN SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE GREAT JOB BUT IN THE MEANTIME. I DON'T SEE ANY ACTION SO THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION BUT IT'S JUST ANOTHER. YOU KNOW A A HEARING OF WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING CORRECT IN AGAIN I JUST PLEAD THAT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE THE HUMAN FACTOR IN THIS INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT DOLLARS AND CENTS LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT BEING SERVICED. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AYE I SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO I'M A. LOOKING AT THE SUMMARY OF THE. STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT. INDICATING THAT. THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES MHSAA FUNDING RESERVES TOTALED FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AS OF THE END OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN. WITH. AN AVERAGE OF BETWEEN A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR MILLION IN EXCESS RESERVES. FOR EACH OF THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES. AND. DAWN. SO I YOU KNOW. I DO NOT HAVE THE BACKGROUND ON THESE MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICE ISSUES AS I DO ESSAY WITH EDUCATION WERE WHERE I SIT ON THE. ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION. BUT YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE. PRUE DEL LEVELS OF RESERVE IS SAYING I KNOW THAT. THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HAVE A RESERVE OF THREE PERCENT. AND. IN ON THE ARGUMENT THAT. THAT THEIR MONEY IS THERE TO BE SPENT FOR THE KIDS HERE AND NOW. AND YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN I DO THINK. YOU KNOW. LIKE EVERYONE HERE I. YOU KNOW SHARE THE ANGUISH OF SEEING. THE HOMELESS PERSON SITTING ON THE BENCH WITH THEIR HANDS THEIR FACE BURIED IN THEIR HANDS IN A DESPERATE FOR HELP. AND I THINK ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT. THAT ARE NOT BEING SPENT TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE. HERE TODAY. HOME I. I WANT TO ASK. MS CAN'T THAT. YOU KNOW THE FLUCTUATIONS AND THE BUDGET AND IN THE STATE'S BUDGET. ARE THE SAME FOUR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION AS THEY ARE ON THE AS THEY ARE FOR. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SEEN OF THE ENTIRE STATE BUDGET IS OVERLY RELIANT ON. THE TOP ONE PERCENT OF. INCOME EARNERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WERE ALL SUBJECT TO THEFT FLUCTUATION IS THERE SOMETHING UNIQUE ABOUT. THEM UP ABOUT. THE MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES THAT. THAT REQUIRE THIS MUCH HIGHER RESERVE. I AM I THINK YOU KNOW SO MY COMMENTS WERE AND. PREDICATED ON MY. HISTORY AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AREA SO. AYE WORKS I. WITHIN THE STATE AND THAT BOTH AGENCY IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT THE RECESSION. GENERAL FUND DEPARTMENTS THAT ERROR HOLY WRIT. RELIANT ON GENERAL FUND SUCH AS OURS. CERTAINLY. I I KNOW THAT EDUCATION SUFFERS WHEN THERE'S A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY. UNDER THE. PROP NINETY EIGHT AND THE GUARANTEE IT IS A MUCH DIFFERENT. OF WORLD THAT EDUCATION LIVES AND THEN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I THINK. ON I'D I'D LOST TRACK OF HOW MANY BILLIONS. THAT WE CUT FROM THE OVERALL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET SO I THINK MY COMMENTS. ARE ALWAYS. HEARKENING BACK TO THE DAYS IN WHICH WE HAD TO MAKE REALLY TERRIBLE POLICY DECISIONS. AROUND SERVICES THAT WE WERE CUTTING BENEFITS THAT WE WERE REMOVING RATES THAT WE WERE REDUCE. ON POPULATIONS THAT WE WERE NOT. DETERMINING ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES AND SO I THINK MY COMMENTS AND. REALLY SENSITIVITY AROUND THE VOLATILITY OF THE REVENUES IS REALLY PREDICATED ON DOT. BOTH THE HARM. AND THIS THE WAY THAT THE STATE HAS REALLY RIGHTED ITSELF IN TERMS OF ITS FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S QUITE SOMETHING TO SIT IN A DEPARTMENT. NOW THAT WE SERVE A THIRD OF THE CALIFORNIANS. AND MEDI CAL WE OVERSEE YOU KNOW A SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND BUDGET BUT I THINK WERE ALSO VERY MINDFUL AND I KNOW. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS AS A WHOLE THAT THE ECONOMY CHANGES AND THAT USUALLY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ON ONE OF THE FIRST. AREAS IN WHICH THERE'S BUDGET REDUCTIONS AND SO I THINK OUR RESERVE. ACCOUNTS ARE ARE RESERVE RECOMMENDATION AND WHY IT'S DIFFERENT. WE WERE TO TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR BOTH EXPENDITURES IN INFLATION. IN WHICH I'M NOT SURE NECESSARILY THAT THAT WAS. EITHER CONTEMPLATED OR ARE PART OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION I THINK ALSO AND I WANTED TO MAKE A FINE POINT. THIS IS NOT WERE NOT SEEN SIXTY FOUR TO EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OR WHATEVER THE SIXTY TO EIGHTY PERCENT. THAT'S NOT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT YOU CAN SET THAT ABOUT A SITE IT IS A CAPS. RESERVE RIGHT SO LIKE IN EDUCATION RIGHT SIDES WANTED TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE I THINK. SENATOR BILL WAS KIND OF GOING DOWN IT MADE IT SOUND LIKE YOU COULD TAKE YOU KNOW THIRTY THREE PERCENT SET ASIDE AND THEN TAKE THE NEXT THIRTY THREE PERCENT SET ASIDE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING WHERE ST. USUAL HAVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIXTY SIX AND EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF YOUR ANNUAL ALLOCATION SET ASIDE AS YOUR MOCKS. PRUDENT RESERVE AND TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT THAT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EXPENDITURES FOR SERVICES AS WELL AS INFLATION. SO THAT WAS THAT WAS HOW WE CAME TO THAT NUMBER. STILL YET A MAIN EXPENSE EXPENDITURES INFLATION AMEND THOSE APPLY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALSO AND SO I I FAILED TO. UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES? AS A AS AS COMPARED TO TWO SCHOOLS AMENDED. WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT? IT'S BETTER. TO TO TO NOT PROVIDE SERVICES WITH THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE HERE TODAY. RATHER THAN RISK HAVING TO CUT IT OFF NEXT YEAR OR OR AND IN IN IN IN TIMES OF A BUDGET DOWNTURN. AND AYE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT I IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THE DAY THAT DESPERATE NEED IS HERE AND NOW AND I UNDERSTAND WHY. WE'RE NOT. SPENDING THAT MONEY NOW. I DON'T THINK I KNOW IT THAT I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE SAYING THAT WE WANT THE COUNTIES TO SIT AND NOT SPEND THE MONEY I THINK THAT WE. A AS I KIND OF MENTION IN THE TOP OF MY COMMENTS SAID THE EIGHTY PERCENT OF THAT ALLOCATION FOR THAT'S THE COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. THE COUNTIES ARE SPENDING THAT YES SO WHERE WORD WE'RE LOOKING AT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE NOT SPENT. ACROSS THE FIFTY SIX COUNTIES YES WELL WITH AN AVERAGE OF. HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION. FOR EACH LOCAL AGENCY. SO ANYWAY. I'D. HAD A. QUICK CONVERSATION WITH SENATOR. BELL AND. I AGREE THAT. THIS ISSUE OF. RESERVES AS PERHAPS SOMETHING THAT THE THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO STEP INTO. TO. INTERVENE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS PANEL. I WOULD LIKE TO. OPEN THE MIKE FOR A PUBLIC COMMENTS. ASKS THAT. ANNUAL WITH PUBLIC COMMENTS SURE TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. TO A MINUTE. APPRECIATE IT. I AM CHOI THORESEN I'M FROM ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA AND I'M ALSO ONE OF THE AND. I THINK ALONG NUYS WOULD YOU SAY OF THE MHSAA ACT ARM AND I'M ALSO CONSUMER. OF THE MENTAL AND AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. NOT ONLY HAVE THEY. CHANGED EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT IMAGES SAY WAS ABOUT WHICH WAS TO SERVE THE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL BUT NOW THEY'VE CHANGED. THE WORDING IS THEY'VE HIDDEN AND NOW THERE'S ALL THIS MONEY WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX. MY QUESTION IS TO YOU MY ILLNESS IS NOT A BEHAVIOR. BUT I HAVE BEHAVIORS THAT NEED TO CHANGE. THROUGH MY MEDICATIONS THROUGH MY THERAPY THROUGH THE THE PROGRAM THAT SAVED MY LIFE I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY WITH A LITTLE. BUT I DO WANT TO SEE THIS MONEY BEING SPENT. AND I NEEDED AREN'T YOU KNOW WE DO NOT HAVE BOARDING CARES ANYMORE ALL OF OUR SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL ARE EITHER. THEIR FAMILIES TRYING TO STRUGGLE TO WHERE TO PUT HIM. TO THEM BEING HOMELESS WE NEED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN NOW THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME'S ROB BLAME WITH THE COUNTY HAVE A HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I'M I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION WE COULD MAKE LONGER COMMENTS I'D APPRECIATE THE ACCOMMODATION. AND WE SUPPORT THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATE AUDITOR AND ACTUALLY WELCOME THE FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP WITH AN APARTMENT AND STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP AROUND THE IMAGES THEY PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. I'M LIKE IN THE AUDIT SAID ALAMEDA RIVERSIDE AND SAN DIEGO DID VERY WELL AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY FOUND TO HAVE COME. COMPLIED WITH AND I JUST A LEGAL REQUIREMENTS REGARDING ALLOCATION OF IMAGE AS A FUNDING. ON THAT SHOW THAT REPORT SHOWS THAT COUNTIES ARE COLLABORATIVE AND ACHIEVING BEST PRACTICES AND ARE CONTINUING TO BE COULD START STEWARDS OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. ON MY ONE UNDERSCORE WHAT SUPERVISOR CAN BE SAID EARLIER THE COUNTIES ARE NOT SITTING ON TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. I'M AB ONE FOURTEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR LAST LEGISLATIVE SESSION GAVE GUIDANCE TO THE COUNTIES ON HOW THESE DOLLARS ACTUALLY COULD BE SPENT PRIOR TO THAT THIS LEGISLATION PART OF THAT THAT LEGISLATION THE COUNTIES CANNOT SPEND THESE DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY OR LOCKED. AND. YOU KNOW LIVE VERY VERSION LAWS ARE INTACT. NOW COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY ACTING PRETTY QUICKLY AND THAT ACTUALLY STARTED THAT THIRTY DAY PROCESS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT TO INVEST THESE DOLLARS NOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN FREED UP IN FACT OUT. DOCTOR PANS DISTRICTS ON SACRAMENTO COUNTY THEIR PLAN HAS BEEN POSTED SINCE FEBRUARY FIFTH AND ABOUT THIRTY SIX DAYS AFTER AB ONE FOURTEEN WHAT WENT INTO FACT. SO THE AIR THEIR PLAN WILL ACTUALLY MAKE MORE IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS IN CRISIS SERVICES ELDER WELLNESS AND HOMELESSNESS ARM WE STRONGLY WE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION TO THE ONLY SEE. THAT PROVIDE CLEAR GUIDANCE ON THE APPROVAL PROCESS AT EXPECTS FOR COUNTY INNOVATION PLANS ON DATA SHOWS AND IT WAS SAID EARLIER THAT SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF THESE FUNDS CURRENTLY SECRETARY VERSION OUR INNOVATIONS ARE INNOVATION FUNDS THAT ARE HAVE FULL OVERSIGHT OF THE ONLY SEE. I'M COUNTIES HAVE HAD A HARD TIME DEVELOPING PROPOSALS THEY'RE BOTH RESPONSIVE TO WHAT THEIR COMMUNITY MEMBER SAY IS NEEDED AND INNOVATIVE. WITH LA I'M WITH WHAT THE OAC STOPPING COMMISSION WANT THEIR COUNTIES TO CONSIDER. WHY THEY ALWAYS SEE DID RECENTLY CONVENE AN INNOVATION SUMMIT OR THE INCUBATOR AS DIRECTED BY THE SPOKE TO EARLIER? ARMED FOR COUNTIES AND OTHER IS THE FOCUS WAS ON THE WAY THE COUNTIES CAN COME UP WITH IN A VERY MODEST AND ASK YOU TO WRAP UP. WE APPLAUD THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION CREDIT ACCEPTABLE AND THE JUST A RESERVE LEVEL AND FOR THE PRIORITIZE PROGRAM DOLLARS TO THE STATE'S HIGHEST PRIORITIES ZUBIATE STAY PROPOSES EACH COUNTY TO BE REQUIRED. TO BUT NO MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THEIR PRIOR PROGRAM INVESTMENTS INTO THE PUT A RESERVE. ON. WE ARE BACK AT A TIME. THANK YOU AT AMANDA WALLER. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WOULD BE T. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NETWORK AND CO DIRECTOR OF OUT FOR MENTAL HEALTH. I'M A PROJECT FUNDED BY. MHSAA I'D TO ENGAGE LGBTQ STAKEHOLDERS IN. IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. FUNDING DECISIONS ABOUT THE STATE AND THE LOCAL LEVEL. AS ADVOCATES WE. APPLIED THE THE. STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT AND. CALLS FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY. AND GREATER LEADERSHIP AT THE STATE LEVEL I'M DIRECTING HOW THESE THESE FUNDS SHOULD BE SPENT. BUT WE ALSO URGE CAUTION. AS I AS THE STATE IS APPLYING PRESSURE TO COUNTIES TO. TO SPEND THESE FUNDS WE'VE SEEN A GREAT VARIETY YEAR AND THE WAY THAT COUNTY IS OUR. ARE AYE ENGAGING IN A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. SOME COUNTIES ARE BEING VERY PROACTIVE GOING OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE TO FIND OUT WHAT'S NEEDED. TO ADDRESS THAT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THAT COUNTY THIS ISN'T THE CASE AT STATEWIDE AND SO YOU KNOW AS AS THE STATE IS URGING COUNTIES TO. I TO SPEND THESE FUNDS WE WE HOPE THAT A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WILL BE A PART OF THAT. AND WE'VE PERSONALLY. HAVE BEEN HAPPY OVER THE LAST YEAR TO. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS EARLIER AND. THE PIII AND INNOVATION. PLAN PROCESS I THINKS TO SOME PROACTIVE OUT REACH FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AND WE HOPE TO SEE IT CONTINUE TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. AND JUST TO PROVIDE ANOTHER CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING AT A LOCAL LEVEL AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TWENTY SECONDS OR LESS I CAN DEFINITELY DO THAT PROBABLY. WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH. UP PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION CONTRACTORS IN CINEMA COUNTY WHO HAVE BEEN TOLD I JUST IN THE LAST MONTH I FEW MONTHS THAT THERE WILL BE ACROSS THE BOARD CUTS. TO THEIR IP  <u><c.green>I.</c></u> CONTRACTS IN THEIR FUNDS THERE'S NOT A LOT OF I TRANSPARENCY YOUR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HOW THIS IS BEING SPENT SO WE HAVE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THERE AT THE STATE LEVEL OF. YOU KNOW ARE THESE BEING APPROPRIATELY SPENT ON PIII ARE PROJECTS. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT RESERVE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL I'M THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO I'M CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AYE PLUSHIE WALKER LGBTQ PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR NOR CAL MENTAL HEALTH AMERICA AND CO DIRECTOR WITH AMANDA WALLER OF OUT FOR A MENTAL HEALTH. I'D LIKE TO PIGGYBACK ON SOME OF MY CO DIRECTORS I'M COMMENTS WE HAVE A CONCERN THAT THE NEED TO SPEND INNOVATION DOLLARS IS HIJACKING THE COMMUNITY PLANNING PROCESS. WE'RE SEEING COUNTY AFTER COUNTY THROW MILLIONS OF INNOVATION DOLLARS AT A SORT OF PRE MADE TECHNOLOGY SUITE THAT DID NOT COME FROM A GRASSROOTS NEED. RATHER RATHER THAN FIND COMMUNITY DEFINED AND COMMUNITY NEEDED PROGRAMS. WE WOULD PREFER TO SEE MONEY REVERTS AND USED AS MHSAA WAS INTENDED WITH A REAL AND MEANINGFUL CONSUMER COMMUNITY AND STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. COUNTIES HAVE UNIQUE AND INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND WE GROW VERY CONCERNED WHEN MULTIPLE COUNTIES ADOPTED THE VERY SAME EXACT INNOVATION PLAN. ALSO AS JUST AS AN ADVOCATE. FOR NOR CAL MHA FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ECHO A COMMENT MADE EARLIER THAT WE MAY HAVE A NEED FOR A STATE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. CURRENTLY MHSAA IS SPLIT OVER THREE STATE DEPARTMENTS AND THE MHS รณ WE SEE. AND I BELIEVE MANY OF THE CHALLENGES YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY ARE CAUSED OR EXACERBATED BY THE LACK OF ONE MENTAL HEALTH FOCUS STATE AGENCY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ANDREA CROAK THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY FOR ACCESS CALIFORNIA WHERE THE CLIENT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FUNDED THROUGH THE MHS OAC. WE TOO ARE IN SUPPORT OF YOUR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND I WE ARE GOING TO BE SEEKING TO WORK WITH THE AWAY SEE. AROUND SOME. LEGISLATIVE FIXES THAT SH I WILL COST THE COUNTIES IN STATE A LITTLETON I'M OUR BIG CONCERN IS AROUND A ROBUST MEANINGFUL CLIENT DRIVEN STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. ON AND WE FEEL THAT WE WE'RE WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT. I JUST ONE ECHO THE SENATE SO HE SAID THAT. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE NEED LEGISLATIVE FIXES. ALL WE NEED IS LEADERSHIP AND I I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. SO. A RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE AS A REQUIREMENT THAT EACH COUNTIES MHSAA COMMUNITY PROGRAM PLANNING PROCESS OUR CREATED UNDER THE RAGS. BE SUBJECT TO THE BROWN ACT AND COMPLY WITH ALL OPEN MEETING LAWS BOMB AND A COUPLE OTHER WE THINK SIMPLE FIXES SO OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MY NAME'S JOHN GARY I'M THE ASSISTANT ADVOCACY DIRECTOR AT NOR CAL MOUTH AMERICA. I ADD UP TO A I JUST TOLD WORKING A LIKE A YEAR AGO AND BEFORE THAT PART OF THAT. I WAS ON MEDI CAL AND RECEIVING A. EMERGENCY SERVICES THROUGH STAFF OF COUNTY AND SANTA SO I HAVE BEEN ON BOTH ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM WITH IT WOULDN'T COME TO THAT. AND IT DID THOUGH SERVICES DID SAVE MY LIFE. I AM CONSUMER AND FAMILY MEMBER WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ADAM. THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE I. I WOULD READ THE DH IS IT DEVIATES. DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES REPORT ON IT AND I DO CONCUR WITH ALL OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS. THESE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS BUT THAT FINALLY THAN IN A REPORT WHERE PEOPLE TO SAY HEY ALEC IT'S THIS IS REALLY. ON WHAT'S GOING ON UP WITH BUT IN WITHIN OUR MENTAL HEALTH WORLD IT'S BEEN KNOWN THESE THAT THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN OUT AND. THE CLUES I COME TO IT I OVERSEE TO MY JOB A NETWORK OF ADVOCATES CONSUMER ADVOCATES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS PHONE DISCUSS WITH THEM FACE TO FACE DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AUDIT. AND OUR CONCLUSION THAT COME THAT YOU THE DEPARTMENT OF CARE SERVICES DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. OR DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO MANAGE IT. SO MAYBE IT'S TIME WE LOOKED IT UP FOR ME A NEW MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT THE COULD FOCUS HIS FELLOW. SOLELY FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND AND AND THE IMAGES SAY AND ALSO AT THE OTHER END WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT STAKEHOLDERS ARE.
