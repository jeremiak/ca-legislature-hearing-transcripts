EVERY LEVEL OF EDUCATION.

00:52:55.906 --> 00:53:00.010 region:rollup2
IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT IT TAKES A

00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:01.879 region:rollup2
VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD BUT WE

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:04.014 region:rollup2
MUST ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT IT

00:53:01.879 --> 00:53:05.783 region:rollup2
TAKES RESOURCES TO RAISE TO

00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:09.219 region:rollup2

RESOLUTION ON PAY EQUITY BUT I

00:53:35.713 --> 00:53:38.682 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:40.284 region:rollup2
MORE ABOUT WHY WE THINK PAY

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:41.985 region:rollup2
EQUITY ARE PAID IN EQUITY IS

00:53:40.284 --> 00:53:43.320 region:rollup2
WRONG. I THINK THAT'S CLEAR

00:53:41.985 --> 00:53:44.088 region:rollup2
WOMEN SHOULDN'T MAKE LESS THAN

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.856 region:rollup2
MEN.

00:53:44.088 --> 00:53:48.559 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT.

00:53:45.856 --> 00:53:51.562 region:rollup2
HOW WE SOLVE THAT ISSUE IN THERE

00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:53.797 region:rollup2
IS ONE THING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY

00:53:51.562 --> 00:53:56.033 region:rollup2
WITH OUT A DOUBT THE BEST WAY TO

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:57.668 region:rollup2
REDUCE PAY INEQUITY AND THAT IS

00:53:56.033 --> 00:53:59.103 region:rollup2
BY UNIONIZING MORE WORKERS? WE

00:53:57.668 --> 00:54:00.904 region:rollup2

00:53:59.103 --> 00:54:02.439 region:rollup2

IF YOU WANT TO RAISE UP WOMEN.

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:26.497 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ALLOW COLLECTIVE

00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:27.664 region:rollup2
BARGAINING IN ORGANIZING AND YOU

00:54:26.497 --> 00:54:30.567 region:rollup2

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:25.515 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:56:23.814 --> 00:56:27.184 region:rollup2
GETTING RID OF THE GENDER WAGE

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:28.885 region:rollup2
GAP ISN'T JUST A QUESTION OF

00:56:27.184 --> 00:56:30.354 region:rollup2
FAIRNESS IT'S ALSO ONE OF

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:32.022 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC SECURITY.

00:56:30.354 --> 00:56:34.091 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WOMEN TWO THIRDS OF

00:56:32.022 --> 00:56:34.591 region:rollup2
WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA WHO WORK

00:56:34.091 --> 00:56:37.027 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE THE HOME ARE THE

00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:38.795 region:rollup2
PRIMARY.

00:56:37.027 --> 00:56:40.564 region:rollup2
OR LARGE.

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:41.531 region:rollup2
WAGE EARNERS FOR THEIR FAMILIES

00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:42.866 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THE BREADWINNERS FOR

00:56:41.531 --> 00:56:45.469 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILIES AND WHEN THEY ARE

00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:46.403 region:rollup2
PAID LESS WE ARE UNDERMINING

00:56:45.469 --> 00:56:47.504 region:rollup2
THEIR ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF

00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:48.805 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILIES AND BE ABLE TO

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:50.007 region:rollup2
HAVE GOOD ECONOMIC SECURITY IN

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:52.643 region:rollup2
OUR STATE.

00:56:50.007 --> 00:56:54.678 region:rollup2
IN THERE'S A A MYTH OUT THERE

00:56:52.643 --> 00:56:56.446 region:rollup2
THAT THE WAGE GAP IS THERE JUST

00:56:54.678 --> 00:56:58.048 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WOMEN DO LEAVE THE WORK

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:59.516 region:rollup2
FORCE TO HAVE CHILDREN AND

00:56:58.048 --> 00:57:01.451 region:rollup2
FAMILIES.

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:03.186 region:rollup2
THE WAGE GAP IS EVIDENT IN

00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:04.254 region:rollup2
CAREERS ACROSS THE BOARD AS

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:06.290 region:rollup2
EARLY AS THE FIRST YEAR OUT OF

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:07.591 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:09.359 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WE

00:57:07.591 --> 00:57:10.327 region:rollup2
NEED TO EDUCATE ONE ANOTHER

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:12.729 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THE MYTHS ARE THE

00:57:10.327 --> 00:57:14.698 region:rollup2
CAUSE OF GENDER WAGE DISPARITY

00:57:12.729 --> 00:57:15.999 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO TACKLE HEAD ON. AND I
