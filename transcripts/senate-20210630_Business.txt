THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN CENTERS AT FOURTEEN OH SEVEN SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION IS A MEASURE TO EDUCATE OUR HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE. ON THE IMPACTS OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO BRING THE DISPARITIES AND NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IT CAN RESULT INTO AND IT. SPECIFICALLY AT FORTINO SEVEN REQUIRES NURSING PROGRAMS. AND HOSPITALS TO INCLUDE IMPLICIT BIAS EDUCATION FOR NURSES. EVIDENCE EXISTS THAT SUGGESTS THAT PRINCE PRESENCE OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM LEADS TO DIFFERENCES IN THE QUALITY OF CARE GIVEN TO PATIENTS AS WELL AS OVERALL HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE SAME EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN ARE THE ONES TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THIS BIAS. IN A HEALTHCARE SETTING DECISIONS AFFECTED BY THIS BIAS CAN HAVE LIFE AND DEATH IMPLICATIONS AS IT MANIFESTS ITSELF THROUGH SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN HOW HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS INTERACT WITH PATIENTS FOR DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH CARE TREATMENTS. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND MUST BE ADDRESSED EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO REDUCE IMPLICIT BIAS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THERE IS A- DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT BY THE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND EDUCATORS TOWARD MITIGATING NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES THESE EFFORTS MUST CONTINUE IF WE ARE TO MAKE STRIDES TOWARD ADDRESSING THE HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR STATE MANY DIVERSE POPULATIONS. AB FORTINO SEVEN WILL BROADEN THESE EFFORTS TO. BRING AWARENESS TO THE ISSUES THESE ISSUES.

NOT SURPRISING IMPLICIT BIAS EXISTS AMONG PEOPLE ALL PROFESSIONS HOWEVER WHEN YOU PUT THE 5% IN THE HEALTHCARE SETTING. IT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES EXPERIENCED BY MEMBERS OF RACIAL ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AND OTHER GROUPS. I WENT TO IMPLICIT BIAS IN A HEALTHCARE SETTING IS REFLECTIVE OF INADEQUACIES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND STRUCTURE. YOU OFTEN THE THIRTY STILL TO LOOK AT THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. YOU NEED NEEDS. A RESOURCES BUT- PHILIP HE NEEDED TO TAP TO FILL THOSE NEEDS. THEY DON'T EVEN EDUCATORS MUSTDEMONSTRATE THEIR COMMITMENT TO ENDING RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES AND WORKING FOR HEALTH EQUITY BY AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING STRATEGIES THAT ELIMINATE THE BIAS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. EIGHTY FORTINO SEVEN RECOGNIZES THAT AWARENESS AND EDUCATION IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD ELIMINATING IMPLICIT BIAS IN A HEALTHCARE SETTING. EDUCATING THE FUTURE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND THEY ARE MINDFUL ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE DEVICE TO THE PATIENTS THEY SERVE IS PARAMOUNT. TO BRING IN THIS PHENOMENON TO ENHANCE.

THAT IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVIN I CAN'T TELL WITH MASKS YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FILE LATER IT'S VIOLATED TEN ASSEMBLY BILL NINE THREE ZERO I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS EIGHTY NINE THIRTY AUTHORIZES AN EXCAVATOR FOR COVER ATTORNEY ATTORNEY FEES TO DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM LAWSUITS ARISING FROM POORLY MARK AND SUBSEQUENTLY DAMAGED UNDERGROUND UTILITIES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE CPC INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY'S LOCATE AND MARK PROGRAM. THE CPC REPORT DETERMINED THAT PG&amp;E FALSIFIED UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN CLAIMS FALSIFIED THEM THESE MARKINGS ARE USED BY CONSTRUCTION CREWS TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHERE. THEIR DANGEROUS UNDERGROUND PIPELINES ARE LOCATED THE CPC ALSO REPORTED SIXTY SEVEN INSTANCES OF DAMAGE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A RESULT. OF THE FALSIFIED RECORDS. THE C. P. C. ALTERNATELY FIND P. JEANNIE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE VIOLATIONS. THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE C. P. C. INVESTIGATION IT WAS A TERM THAT PG&amp;E WOULD LEVERAGE ITS LEGAL RESOURCES TO FILE CLAIMS AGAINST. LESS RESOURCEFUL EXCAVATION CONTRACTORS PEOPLE THAT WE NORMALLY CALL SMALL BUSINESSES. THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT PG&amp;E CREATED A WAR ROOM WITH THE SOLE INTENTION TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS AGAINST CONTRACTORS. EIGHTY NINE THIRTY WILL MAKE UTILITY COMPANIES THINK TWICE BEFORE FIRING OFF CLAIMS IT WILL FORCE THEM TO INCREASE THE ACCURACY OF THEIR UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE AT LOCATING PROGRAM. INCREASING SAFETY FOR WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR VOTE I HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MR CHER AND- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THIS IS GERALD MELZER IS SPELLED M. O. USY I. S. BEEN A PRACTICING ATTORNEY IN CALIFORNIA FOR APPROXIMATELY FORTY ONE YEARS AND THEN THE MANAGING PARTNER OF THE MOUSE'S LAW FIRM IN TUSTIN SPECIALIZING IN CONSTRUCTION LAW ON CONSTRUCTION RELATED CLAIMS I AM ALSO A BOARD MEMBER OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. ATTORNEY'S FEES ISSUES ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT IN CALIFORNIA WE USE THE AMERICAN ROLE WHICH IS BASICALLY THAT ALL PARTIES PAY THEIR OWN WAY. EXCEPT FOR TWO MAJOR EXCEPTIONS ONE BY CONTRACT IF THERE'S A CONTRACTUAL CLAUSE AND OTHERS BY STATUTE. HERE IN THE SITUATION OF EXCAVATORS DEPENDING THESE LAWSUITS THERE IS NO CONTRACT THEREFORE THERE'S NO CLAIM FOR ATTORNEY'S FEES THAT WOULD GO EITHER WAY THERE. SO THIS STATUTE IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE ESCALATORS FROM THESE NUISANCE VALUE LOSSES. IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER STATUTES THE CALIFORNIA FALSE CLAIMS ACT UNDER THE GOVERNMENT CODE HAD A ONE WAY ATTORNEYS FEES CLAUSE IN FAVOR OF THE- PROSECUTING AUTHORITY IN THOSE MATTERS THAT IF THERE WAS A FALSE CLAIM RECUT RECOVERY COULD BE MADE AGAINST A CONTRACTOR WHO SUBMITTED A FALSE CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR PAYMENT. THAT WAS NOT TRUE- THAT WAS LATER AMENDED IT BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT STANDARDS- WHERE A CONTRACTOR CAN GET ATTORNEYS FEES THEY ASKED TO SHOW A FRIVOLOUS NATURE UNLIKE THE PROSECUTING AUTHORITY PROMPT PAYMENT STATUTE CALL FOR ATTORNEYS FEES- GOING WHERE THERE'S NO GOOD FAITH DISPUTE. THERE WERE PAYMENT WITHOUT. AND EVEN IN- THE SPECIAL MOTIONS TO STRIKE THE ANTI SLAPP STATUTES. DOES CALL FOR DIFFERENT STANDARD OF ATTORNEYS FEES GOING EITHER WAY DEPENDING ON- WHETHER OR NOT THE PUBLICATION WAS CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST OR NOT SO. ALL OF THESE STATUTES WHETHER ONE WAY OR TWO WAY BY WAY OF PREVAILING PARTIES- WILL FORCE POTENTIAL LITIGANTS AND ATTORNEYS TO EVALUATE THEIR CLAIMS EARLY ON. A RATHER THAN- AS ASSEMBLY PERSON LEVINS AND JUST LAUNCH OFF INTO LITIGATION OR WITH CLIENTS- THEY TO DERIVE NUISANCE VALUE LOSSES. THIS BILL WILL PROMOTE SAFETY WHERE WILL FORCE THE HIGHER UPS AT THESE UTILITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE LINES ARE MARKED PROPERLY. AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY- UNDERLYING OTHER STATUTES ENACTED. TO MINIMIZE LITIGATION- BY AVOIDING THESE NUISANCE VALUE LOSSES- AGAINST EXCAVATORS WHO ARE THEN FORCED FOR ECONOMIC REASONS. WE PAY THE SETTLEMENT RATHER THAN DEFEND THEM ON THE MERITS SO THANK YOU MR HERE FOR YOUR TIME AND I WOULD APPRECIATE A NIGHT FULL ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU SIR NEXT WITNESS SOME OF MY NOTES INDICATE MISTER STEVE WARD.

THANK YOU LET'S BRING THE MATTER BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE CHAMBER COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS I SEE SENATOR JONES PLEASE PROCEED. MR CHAIRMAN- SOMEONE RELIVING THAT I TYPICALLY HAVE A CONCERN WITH ONE SIDED- LEGAL FEE RECOVERY- I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE IS WELL REASONED. CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THAT- AND YOU KNOW WHY NOT. YOU KNOW MAKE IT EQUITABLE. YEAH SO I THINK I EQUITY AS A REALLY FASCINATING TERM TO USE LET'S LET'S WALK THROUGH KIND OF WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO HELP HERE SO YOU'VE GOT A SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTOR. THEY FOLLOW THE LAW THEY CALL EIGHT ONE ONE. THEY HAVE THE LINES THE GAS LINES MARKED. BAY THEN FOLLOW THAT. LISTEN TO IT IT HERE TO IT DO EVERYTHING THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND THEN IN WHEREVER IT IS THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR WORK NOT THE MARK LINES END UP HITTING A LINE- SO WHAT YOU SAW IN THE P. U. C. INVESTIGATION WAS THAT. P. GENIE IN PARTICULAR ACTUALLY HAD AN ORGANISM ORGANIZED- OPERATION. TO MAXIMIZE CLAIMS- OUT OF THESE TYPES OF ISSUES WHERE THEY HAD MISSED MARKED LINES. AND THEN THEY TRIED TO SAY TO THE EXCAVATOR. IF YOU GIVE US TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WE'LL JUST SETTLE THIS. BUT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A SMALL BUSINESS YOU KNOW CONTRACTOR IN IN THE COMMUNITY SAYING WELL IF I NEED TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY FOR THIS. IT'S GOING TO COST ME FORTY GRAND. SO IT'S CHEAPER JUST TO PAY OUT. TO THE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY WHOSE PUT. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN RESOURCES TO MAXIMIZING THESE EXACT SAME TYPES OF SETTLEMENTS. THEY THEY THEY DON'T HAVE A WAY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM ALL OF THAT. SO IT'S INTERESTING TO TALK ABOUT EQUITY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT. DONE YOU KNOW MONTHLY YOU KNOW HOW ARE WE GONNA PAY THE BILLS AND PAY OUR EMPLOYEES VERSUS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR. CORPORATION SO IN IN THIS. SITUATION WHERE THE CONTRACTOR CALLS EIGHT ONE ONE. THAT'S THE END OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AS FAR AS WHERE THE MARKINGS ARE PUT AND- AND ALL THAT THAT'S DONE EITHER BY THE- THE UTILITY OR- A CONTRACTOR THAT THE UTILITY. HIRES TO COME MAKE THOSE MARKINGS AND EXCAVATORS JUST FOLLOWING. WHAT THEY'RE BEING TOLD TO FOLLOW BY THE UTILITY IS THAT CORRECT. YOU KNOW I I'D BE GLAD FOR ONE OF THE WITNESSES WHO YOU KNOW WORKS DIRECTLY WITH CONTRACTORS ON WHAT THE SPECIFICS ARE. I GUESS THAT MIGHT THE BOTTOM LINE OF MY QUESTION IS. ON THE EXCAVATING AND WHERE TO EXCAVATE WHERE DOES. THE EXCAVATORS RESPONSIBILITY END AS FAR AS- WHERE THEY PUT THEIR SHOVEL I GUESS IT IS THE- MOST DIRECT WAY CAST THAT QUESTION. IF WE NEED TO GO ALONG ON THE LINE LET'S HOLD THAT THOUGHT. LET'S TAKE IT WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM BECAUSE I HAVE MEMBERS BOUNCING AROUND FROM COMMITTEE TO COMMITTEE AND I CURRENTLY HAVE IT ON THE FLOOR SO. CENTER JONES IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO ABSOLUTELY I WISH A CORN BEFORE YOU GET AN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. HOLD THAT QUESTION. THESE ESTABLISH A QUORUM.

BILL HAS EIGHT VOTES OFFICIALLY GET OUT BUT WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESEARCHER THANK YOU MEMBERS. LET'S RETURN TO FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. WELCOME YOU HAVE ONE BUILDER PRESENT TODAY A. B. FOUR SIX EIGHT PLEASE PROCEED IN READING GOOD MORNING MR TERENCE SENATORS I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS I'M MAKING A COMMITMENT TO TAKE AMENDMENTS IN SENATE JUDICIARY TO ADDRESS THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THE ANALYSIS. AMBER THIS IS A BILL THAT IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURE. TO PROTECT SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A SECOND TO TELL YOU THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS BILL. IT CAME AFTER I HEARD A STORY ON NPR. ABOUT A FAMILY WHO HAD A SEVERELY AUTISTIC CHILD. WHO THEY WANTED TO PURCHASE A SUPPORT ANIMAL. TWO OF. THE THOUGHT TO HELP CALM THE CHILD SO THEY PAID I BELIEVE IT WAS AROUND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A DEALER WHO CLAIMED THAT THESE WERE SPECIALLY TRAINED SUPPORT ANIMALS. TOOK THE DOG HOME. THE DOG IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED THE FAMILY'S OTHER PET. KILLED IT IN FRONT OF THIS CHILD CAUSING DEEP TRAUMA TO THE CHILD WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT UNDER THE LAW. THERE IS NO DEFINITION OF AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL THERE IS NO TRAINING THAT IS REQUIRED BY LAW. THIS WAS A FRAUDULENT SALE. TO A VERY VULNERABLE MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY. NOW THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO PROTECT THOSE THE RIGHT TO PEOPLE WHO CONSISTENTLY HAVE TO FIGHT FOR EQUAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC SPACES AND BASIC CIVIL RIGHTS. TO SAFETY AND INDEPENDENCE RATES AVAILABLE FREELY TO THOSE WITHOUT DISABILITIES. EIGHTY FOUR SIXTY EIGHT WOULD PREVENT THE SALE OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS AND THEIR EQUIPMENT. AS BEING REPRESENTATIVE OF HAVING THE SAME RATES AS A GUIDE SIGNAL OR SERVICE DOG. AND IT REQUIRES A SILVER MOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS AND EQUIPMENT. TO BE ACCOMPANIED WITH A WRITTEN NOTICE EXPLAINING TO CONSUMERS BUT THEY DID NOT CONFIRM THE SAME TRAINING. THE SAME FOR THE SAME BENEFITS AS AS GUIDE DOGS AND SERVICE DOGS. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT A HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONER. PROVIDING DOCUMENTATION RELATING TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S NEED FOR AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT DOG. THAT IS NOT A GUIDE OR SERVICE DOG AS DEFINED. AND LESS THE HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONER COMPLIES WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. IT IS A PRIVILEGE NOT A RIGHT TO BE THE OWNER OF AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT OR SERVICE DOG. AND THE TWO CLASSIFICATIONS DO NOT MERIT THE SAME LEVEL OF PUBLIC ACCESS. UNFORTUNATELY INDIVIDUALS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT FOR THEIR OWN PRIVILEGE ACCESS IN PUBLIC SPACES. BUT CONSEQUENTLY PUT EVERYONE AROUND THEM AT RISK OF HARM BUT USUALLY THOSE WHO ACTUALLY NEED A GUIDE OR A SERVICE DOG. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO USE TASKTRAINED SERVICE DOGS EARNED THEIR RIGHT TO BE IN PUBLIC SPACES AS A RESULT OF RIGOROUS TRAINING OF A RIGOROUS TRAINING PROCESS. AND ENSURING THAT THEIR SERVICE DOGS SATISFIED BEHAVIORAL STANDARDS UNDER THE ADA. THE FRAUDULENT AND CRUEL SELLING OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT DOGS AND IDENTIFYING EQUIPMENT IS ENTITLING THE SAME ACCESS RATES AS SERVICE DOGS. NOT ONLY CREATES CONFUSION TO THE OWNER OF THE ANIMAL. BUT ALSO TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHICH HAS TO COMPLY WITH ADA LAWS. ADDITIONALLY THE PERCEIVED NEED FOR THIS IDENTIFYING EQUIPMENT DUE TO BUSINESSES STRESS TO FIND THIS REQUIREMENT. IS BASICALLY TO FRAUD IT'S BASICALLY DEFRAUDING PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISABILITIES. EIGHTY FOUR SIXTY WILL HELP CURTAIL THE MISREPRESENTATION OF BUYING AND SELLING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT DOGS. AND THEY'RE IDENTIFYING EQUIPMENT AS HAVING EQUAL ACCESS RATES AS TRAINED SERVICE DOGS. CREATING A SAFER PUBLIC SPACE FOR ALL ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO RELY ON THESE TASKS TRAINED DOGS FOR THEIR INDEPENDENCE. THIS BILL IS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY- INVISIBLY B. APPEARED ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR WITH NO NO VOTES.

THIS IS A NECESSITY FOR MANY OF US. AND SERVICE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED FOR DECADES AS A LEGITIMATE AID. BEEN WELL INTEGRATED INTO OUR SOCIETY. UNFORTUNATELY RECENTLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AS A FAMILY MEMBER FINANCIAL STATED WE'VE HAD THIS GROWTH OF. REALLY PREDATORY BUSINESSES ONLINE THOMASINE THAT THEY CAN TAKE ME BACK AND GIVE THEM A CERTIFICATE OF THE DATE PRINT OUT OF THE COMPUTER. IN FACT BASICALLY THAT SIGNIFICANT WOULD GIVE THEM. EQUAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC SPACES A SERVICE ANIMAL. IT PUTTING THAT BACK IN DANGER OF PUTTING MANY OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THAT. DOG HANDLER OR ANIMAL HANDLER IN DANGER AS WELL. TURNING SEVEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. ON THOSE OF US WHO DO DEPEND ON OUR SERVICE ANIMAL. I JUST WANT A QUOTE- SOME NUMBERS FROM MANY- SURVEYED THAT OUR SISTER ORGANIZATION OF COSPONSORED- CANINE COMPANIONS FOR INDEPENDENCE CONDUCTED LAST YEAR. 93% OF THOSE WHO RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY THESE ARE THE JUDGMENTS OF HER CAMEL.

PERFECT CETERA I'D LIKE TO ALSO THANK THE AUTHOR OF WHEN WE THINK OF THE PEOPLE DISABILITIES THAT NEED THESE DOGS- IT IS VITAL VICTOR NOT ONLY WELL PROTECTED BUT WELL REPRESENTED IN THE IN THE PURCHASE OF THE DOGS AND I'M THINKING OF THE VETERANS WHO ARE NOW BECOMING MORE MORE ACTIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WITH PTSD AND THE DOGS ARE MAKING A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE AND SHOW WHEN YOU GET A GOOD QUALIFIED CERTIFIED ANIMAL THIS IS FANTASTIC AND I TOO WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF THE- THIS MOVEMENT.

ABOUT WHAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM. GOING FORWARD AND I THINK ALSO THAN BEING ABLE TO REGULATE. AT WHERE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO GO.

SEEING NONE ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- JUST TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT AND I. FEEL VERY HONORED TO BE ABLE TO CARRY THIS. BILL AND I. TO SENATOR EGGMAN'S POINT.

BILL HAS NINE VOTES SUFFICIENT TO GET OUT WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS NICE JOB ASSEMBLY MEMBER. NEXT ITEM IS ITEM NUMBER SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDING SIR THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE PLEASED TO HAVE YOU HERE YOU HAVE THREE ITEMS THE FIRST ONE IS A B. TWO TWO NINE PLEASE PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU GERMAN ROCK AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TODAY I PRESENT AN ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TWO NINE THE BILL THAT PROHIBITS A PERSON REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED AS A SECURITY GUARD FROM CARRYING OR USING A FIRE ARM OR BATON A LESSON SECURITY GUARD IS AN EMPLOYEE. OF A PRIVATE PATROL OPERATOR LICENSEE OR AN EMPLOYEE OF THE STATE. MEMBERS OF THE CAT COUNTRY WATCHED THE TRIAL OF THEIR CHILDREN THE EX POLICE OFFICER CHARGED WITH THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOOR THERE WAS A SIMULTANEOUS DISCUSSION. REGARDING LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE TRAINING OF THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE. THE CONVICTION OF CHILDREN WITH THE FIRST STEP IN SECURING JUSTICE FOR FOUR. NOW THE NATION SETS ITS SIGHTS ON THE OTHER THREE OFFICERS THAT FAILED TO INTERVENE AND ULTIMATELY WATCHED AS FLOYD'S FINAL MOMENTS ON EARTH EXPIRED. BUT TODAY I WANTED TO KNOWLEDGE AND BRING AWARENESS TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY CARRY FIREARMS BATONS. LLOYD TO KEEP OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND PROPERTY SAFE AS WELL AS THE FINANCIAL DEALINGS OF BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY ARE HARD TO KEEP THE PEACE AT SPORTING EVENTS AND CONCERTS. THERE ARE SECURITY GUARDS. BUT PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS DIFFER FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND A NUMBER OF AREAS I WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY OFTEN FACE SIMILAR SITUATIONS EVEN TRAGIC ONES. MEMBERS MARIO MATTHEWS WAS A MEXICAN AMERICAN WHO WORKED AS A WAREHOUSE WORKER. ACCORDING TO A LAWSUIT FILED BY HIS PARENTS ON JULY SECOND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AT AROUND THREE THIRTY AM AFTER ATTENDING AN OUTDOOR CONCERT FOLLOWING TWO NBA EXHIBITION GAME TOMORROW ENTERED THE GOLDEN ONE CENTER. HERE IN SACRAMENTO THROUGH A PROPPED OPEN DOOR WHICH WAS PART OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE. VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SHOWED MARIO RUNNING AROUND THE COURT AND DRIBBLING AS IF HE WAS PLAYING BASKETBALL. BEEN TO UNIVERSAL PROTECTION SECURITY PERSONNEL BEGAN CHASING MARIO AND EVENTUALLY DETAINED HIM. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES THAT MARIO WAS SLAMMED FACE FIRST INTO A WALL. TACKLED AND RESTRAINED FACE DOWN ON THE FLOOR HIS HANDS WERE HANDCUFFED BEHIND HIS BACK IN THE TWO SECURITY PERSONNEL GOT ON TOP OF HIS BACK. ONE SECURITY GUARD USES RIGHT NEED TO APPLY PRESSURE TO THE SIDE TOMORROW SNACK FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES. IN ADDITION TO THE INITIAL TWO UNIVERSAL PROTECTION SECURITY PERSONNEL A THIRD SECURITY OFFICER PLACED HIMSELF ON MORROW'S BACK. MORROW BECAME UNRESPONSIVE AND WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL HE PASSED AWAY TWO DAYS LATER. THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS AT THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY CORONER ACKNOWLEDGE THE RESTRAINT WAS A CAUSE OF MORROW'S DEATH. ADDITIONALLY THE CORONER'S PATHOLOGIST REPORT NOTED DEEP BRUISING ON MARS BACK AS A RESULT OF THE WEIGHT AND PRESSURE THAT HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIM. MARIO WEIGHED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POUNDS. WELL THE NATION DEBATES LAW ENFORCEMENT'S TRAINING ON THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS CURRENTLY HAVE NO TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR COURSES ON THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE. EIGHTY TWO TWENTY NINE WOULD AD THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE TO THE TRAINING COURSES WITHIN THE PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICE ACT INCLUDING TRAINING ON THE USE OF OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE FORCE. THE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BIAS AND CULTURAL TRAINING. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE COURSE AND THE CARRYING AND USE OF FIREARMS TO INCLUDE TRAINING IN THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATION COULD HELP SAVE OTHERS. MEMBERS MY OFFICE HAS BEEN AND HAS HAD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AND REVIEW THE LETTER. OF CONCERN FROM CONSECO. WE HAVE SPENT THE PAST FEW DAYS WORKING TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE USE OF FORCE TRAINING BE CONDUCTED IN A TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM SETTING. I'VE COMMITTED TO CALL CIGNA THAT I WILL WORK WITH THEM TO FIND AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN. TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM TRAINING AND THEIR SUGGESTION OF WEB BASED. PLATFORM TRAINING. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE CONSULTANT FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS STUART KATZ ATTORNEY FOR THE FAMILY OF MORROW MATTHEWS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU MISS CATS PLEASE PROCEED. A GOOD MORNING I THINK THIS LEGISLATION IS APPROPRIATE AND OVERDUE. I BELIEVE THAT MOST PEOPLE DO BOTH HIRE SECURITY GUARDS. IN GOOD FAITH AND INTERACT WITH IT WILL BE SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THEY RECEIVED NO TRAINING. IN THE REGIONAL USE OF FORCE. THIS BILL IS NOT TURNING SMALL NOT OF INTO BUT IN POINT OF FACT I BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE. REGARDING INDIVIDUAL COMING THIS. THEN ARE FOUR LAW. OFFICERS HELLO. THE FOLKS FOR INTERACT THE PUBLIC. YOU KNOW FAR RIGHT FOR. THE BEST OF THE- ONLY CALL ONE FOR AFTER THEY'VE ALREADY KIND. WITH ARE CLEAR NO DOWN IN THIS BILL AND GIVEN THE LIMITED TRAINING THEY RECEIVE AT THIS POINT. THE INCREMENTAL DIFFERENCE. IN THIS TRAINING FOR FORCE- WON'T HAVE MORE OF IF YOU'LL BANG FOR BUCK FOR THE PEOPLE GIVING THE TRAINING AND JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF RESISTANCE- PRODUCING UNNECESSARY. INJURIES DO ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT TYPE CONTACTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR WHEN I TURNED A WITNESS IS IN THE GALLERY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AB TWO TWO NINE SEEING NONE LET'S TURN TO ROOM ONE TWELVE. CHECK TO SEE IF THERE ANY WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY THEY'RE SEEING NONE LET'S TURN TO THE TELECONFERENCING. MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT ANY WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF A.

AND FIRST OF ALL THE LINE UP TWENTY SIX. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME'S JERRY DESMOND WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LICENSED INVESTIGATORS WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE AT THIS TIME WE'VE JUST RECENTLY IDENTIFIED THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT WOULD AMEND THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR ACT TO REQUIRE USE OF FORCE BY A LICENSED PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR AND- FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL RESEARCH WE'VE IDENTIFIED A CONFIRM THAT. THAT PROVISION THAT'S AN EXISTING- PETE I ACT. SHOULD NOT BE THERE IT WAS A CARRY OVER FROM WHEN THE P. I ACTED THE SECURITY ACT WORK I CAN GET IT BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE I BELIEVE THAT. THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE BILL ANALYSIS WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE MEASURE BE AMENDED TO ELIMINATE THE CURRENT- BNP CODE SECTION SEVEN FIVE FOUR TWO SUBDIVISION. A ONE BECAUSE A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER OR THE AUTHORITY TO ARREST PARTY ARREST ONE OF THE READY TO USE FORCE. IN AND WE BELIEVE IT'S A US A CARBOCATION AMENDMENT THAT WE'VE JUST BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION THAT THE AUTHOR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE AS IT WAS FOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. YEAH AND OVER ON CLIMATE TWENTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID CHANDLER I'M THE PRESIDENT OF CAL SAGA- THE CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION OF LICENSE SECURITY AGENCIES GUARD SHORT. WE ARE ALL OPPOSE TO BILL- WE JUST HAVE SOME- WE HAVE THE TO WORK WITH- SOMEONE THEM AND THEY SHALL. ON THIS WE'D GO WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT- OUR BIGGEST ISSUE. FOR THE- INSTRUCTOR TO BE PHYSICALLY. IN THE ROOM AS WELL KNOW GOING. ALL THAT- CLASS SHOULD. WERE WERE STOPPED AND WE DON'T WANT TO. THIS SITUATION HAPPEN AGAIN AND WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO EMPLOY PEOPLE- AT THAT POINT BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE A CLASSROOM SESSION SO- MR HOLDEN'S OFFICE BUT AS SHE WAS GRACIOUSLY WORKING. WITH US- YOU ALSO PLEASE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THAT OUR EMPLOYEES ARE AT MINIMUM WAGE OR JUST ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE AND IT IS SOMETIMES HARD FOR THEM. TO GET TO FROM A- A PERSONALITY IN ORDER TO- TAKE THE INITIAL POWERS OF ARREST CLASS AND WHICH WOULD ADD THE- ESCALATION DISTORTION PORTION OF THE PROPRIOCEPTION CLASS IN THAT PORTION IN ORDER TO BE A SECURE YOU ARE. IN CALIFORNIA- SHOAL DAILY. IT WOULDN'T JUST BE TOUGH FOR THEM ALSO- IN THE- SECOND SECTION OF- THIRD SECTION ON PAGE NINE OF YOUR BRIEF- THE BUREAU OF FOREIGN. MISSILE LAUNCHERS TRYING TO HELP. WITH REMOVING THE WORD PHYSICAL ALTERCATION FOR REPORTING. MECHANISMS FOR THE GIRLS WHO INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES ON ANY PHYSICAL ALTERCATION REMOVING THE WORK PHYSICAL. ANY ALTERCATION THERE ARE FOUR WOULD BE RECORDABLE THE BERYL WITH THINGS THAT WOULD BE. A TREMENDOUS BURDEN. DAILY IN HIGH- SITUATION- SECURITY. ARE CALLED TO US HOSPITAL PER. IN RESTRAINING PEOPLE. THAT ARE MENTALLY ILL PRESIDENT. BUSH AND THAT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS REPORTING ISSUES. WITH THEM AND WE DON'T. WE JUST WON'T CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SEMINOLES OFFICE AND THEN YOU JUST CLARIFY THIS THE SMALL LITTLE POINTS. MHM THANKS SIR. NEXT THANK YOU. NO FURTHER AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MODERATOR LET'S BRING THE MATTER BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE CHAMBER QUESTIONS COMMENTS AND CONCERNS COLLEAGUES FIRST CINNAMON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO- FIRST COMMAND THE AUTHOR- YOUR OPENING STATEMENT WAS WAS VERY POWERFUL AND THIS IS CLEARLY A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND- I APPRECIATE- THE THOUGHTFULNESS BEHIND THIS BILL IT SEEMS TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE IN IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE- REAL CONCERN THAT WE ALL READ ABOUT- IT UNFORTUNATELY ALL TOO COMMON THESE DAYS- AND SO I. WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION AND THAT IS THAT GIVEN THE COURTS AND I SAY COURTS IN THE PLURAL BUT THE SUPREME COURT AND ALSO MADE A FEDERAL COURT'S. VERY AGGRESSIVE IN IN MY VIEW EXCESSIVE EXCESSIVELY EXPANSIVE VIEW OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT- I DIDN'T SEE THIS IN THE COMMUNAL SISTER HERE FROM ANY OF THE WITNESSES BUT- PERHAPS YOU COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE ART DO YOU THINK THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT CONCERNS. PARTICULARLY AROUND THE PROVISION THAT WOULD- PROHIBIT REGISTERED SECURITY GUARDS FROM CARRYING OR USING FIREARMS. UNLESS THEY ARE AN EMPLOYEE OF A PPO LICENSEE OR THE STATE OR POLITICAL SUBDIVISION IS STATE. I GUESS MY CAN MINOR CONCERN MIGHT BE THAT THAT WOULD RUN INTO- JUDGES JUST LIKE THE ONE WE SAW IN SAN DIEGO THAT TAKE THAT. EXPANSIVE VIEW THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND MORE THE WELL REGULATED ART- AND THEN WE COULD SEE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THAT SO I JUST OPEN IT UP FOR YOUR RESPONSE- THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK YOU PROBABLY TEED UP AN IMPORTANT- QUESTION TO BE ADDRESSED IN OUR NEXT COMMITTEE THAT THE BILL WOULD BE- PRESENTED AND- OUR- OUR GOAL CERTAINLY IS NOT TO TRY TO RUN AFOUL. OF FEDERAL LAW- WE WANT TO RAISE UP A STANDARD IN WHICH THESE PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS. ARE TRAINED ESPECIALLY IN THE USE OF EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE. BECAUSE WE BELIEVETHAT IN TERMS OF THE LEASE CAROLINE- ALLOWING THAT TO HOW- LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SWORN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNDER POST. ARE TRAINED- WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TURN THEM INTO THAT BUT JUST ALSO TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE ROBUST. INTRODUCTION TO HOW TO ENGAGE IN ENGAGE WITH THE PUBLIC. AND IN MATTERS OF ADDRESSING- THE USE OF FORCE WITHIN THE CONTEXT. AS CONSIGO REPRESENTATIVE. IDENTIFIED THE STATUES THAT THE GOVERNOR- SO WE- I CAN JUST SAY THAT. AS WE MOVE TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE. I'M SURE THAT- AS IT RELATES TO SORTOF THE- THE LEGAL JUDICIAL TYPE OF ISSUES THAT. YOU'VE RAISED WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THOSE AS WELL BUT- WE CERTAINLY. ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO COLLABORATE. CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE WITH ADMINISTRATION- WE HAVE- BEEN WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE WERE GETTING THE RIGHT FEEDBACK- SO THE RECONSTRUCTION THE BILL ACCORDINGLY. AND THAT WITH THE INDUSTRY ISSUE FOR TODAY WE'VE BEEN. AND DEEP- PARTNERSHIP. AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT IT WILL WORK WITH THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD- TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES THAT ALONG THE LINES THAT YOU BROUGHT UP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE AND I APPRECIATE THAT- IT'S A RIGHTEOUS BILL AND IF I COULD I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AT THE EARLIEST APPROPRIATE TIME. TO BE MINOR. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU SENATOR BENTSEN AND PLEASE AND THANK YOU MR ENDED IN MISTRIAL THANK THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL GLAD TO SUPPORT TODAY. I WANT TO. VISIT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT MR CHANDLER FROM CAL SAGA. BROUGHT UP AT THE THERE'S A NUMBER OF INSTANCES- REFERENCED IN THE ANALYSIS WERE EITHER LANGUAGE USE AMBIGUOUS OR THERE'S A NEED FOR. ADDITIONAL DEFINITION- PAGES NINE AND TEN AND SO I GUESS THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS IS. I'M I'M I'M ASSUMING. YOU'RE AMENABLE TO MAKING THESE AMENDMENTS. YES AND I WOULD I GUESS I WOULD ASK ARE THERE ANY. INSTANCES IN THE ANALYSIS WHERE YOU WOULD TAKE ISSUE. WITH THE PROPOSED MINUTES AGO THEY ALL SEEM VERY REASONABLE TO ME. I KNOW I THINK THAT THEY ARE VERY REASONABLE I THINK WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW AS WE'RE SORT OF BEING INTRODUCED TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS. HERE AT THIS AT THIS JUNCTURE IN THE IN THE- COURSE OF THIS BILL. THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SORT OF SIT DOWN AND UNDERSAND SORT OF. ALL OF THE DIFFERENT DYNAMICS BUT IT SEEMS VERY. STRAIGHTFORWARD WE CERTAINLY DON'T SEE ANYTHING THAT WOULD JUMP OUT AT US AS- BEING OFFENSIVE AND WILL- I CAN GUARANTEE YOU WILL PROBABLY GET TO A SOLUTION AND- THIS WILL PROBABLY BE THE KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT WILL. COME UP WITH WHAT WE JUST. DISCOVER SOME LATITUDE TO SORT OF. BETTER UNDERSTAND AND SERVE FOR FINESSE THE DETAIL OF THE LANGUAGE BUT THERE. THE THEME IN CONTEXT OF WHAT IT'S HOW IT'S PRESENTED WE WOULD DEFINITELY SUPPORT THAT YEAH I TRIED I DO APPRECIATE THAT SO- YOU KNOW IN. IN MANY CASES ANALYSIS YOU REACH. A GOOD POINT WERE CLEARLY THERE ARE CERTAIN ISSUES TO BE THE PRINCIPAL OR OR POLICY- ABETTING THIS CASE IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT. YOU KNOW FINDING THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE- THAT EITHER DOESN'T LEAVE SOMETHING UNDEFINED.

WITHOUT AMENDMENTS TO BE ABLE TO- ADDRESSED THE TECHNICAL CHANGES AND AMBIGUITY IN SOME OF THE LANGUAGE. YEAH I THINK WHAT TO THANK YOU FOR. GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR I THINK WHAT. HAS BEEN RAISED ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WAS SORT OF OUTSIDE THE CONTOUR HOW WE'VE BEEN MOVING FORWARD. AND SO WE'RE JUST SORT OF BECOMING ENGAGED ON THIS- I DON'T SEE ANY REAL ISSUES. AND IT'S PROBABLY JUST WORD SMITHING I THINK THE COMMITTEE. WAS TAKING. THE HIGHLIGHTING ELEMENTS THAT WERE IN THE LETTER PRESENTED BY BECAUSE I GOT IT AND WE JUST WANNA. MAKE SURE THAT IN ADDRESSING THEIR ISSUES WE DON'T. INADVERTENTLY DO ANYTHING THAT UNDERMINES THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH. I MAY BE BEING- A MORE CAUTIOUS BUT I'M NOT. I'M SAYING THAT I'M AGREEING WITH THE COMMITTEE'S. DIRECTION AND WHAT- BOTH- MEMBERS OF THE HIGHLIGHTED AND WE WILL. GET TO- AGREEMENT. ON ON ON ON THE LANGUAGE IN THE SPIRIT AND INTENT. OF WHAT IT'S DESIGNED TO ACCOMPLISH OKAY THANK YOU.

THANK YOU GERMAN- AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL NINE FOUR EIGHT THE BILL THAT REQUIRES THAT EVERY CONTACT OR CONTRACT FOR THE SALE OF REAL PROPERTY CONTAIN A NOTICE INFORMING THE BUYER AND SELLER OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPORT ANY SUSPICION OF DISCRIMINATORY. APPRAISAL BY A REAL ESTATE APPRAISER THROUGH THE BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE APPRAISERS AND TAT INTERNET. A WEBSITE OR TELEPHONE NUMBER. FOR THOSE WHO SEEK TO REFINANCE THEIR PROPERTY THE NOTICE WILL BE PROVIDED IN THE LOAN MATERIALS. AMID THE FAIR HOUSING ACT IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT PROHIBITS HOME APPRAISERS FROM DISCRIMINATING BASED ON RACE RELIGION NATIONAL ORIGIN OR GENDER. HOWEVER OVER FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE ACT WAS PUT IN PLACE THE HOMES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE STILL BEING UNDERVALUED. RECENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN A SERIES OF DOCUMENTED INSTANCES WHERE THE HOMES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE BEING UNDERESTIMATED. FOR EXAMPLE IN MARIN CITY AN APPRAISER UNDERESTIMATED A BLACK COUPLES HOME BY NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN OAKLAND AN APPRAISER LOWBALL THE VALUE OF A BLACK AND PORTER RICAN COUPLE'S HOME BY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND. THERE HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL HEADLINES AND NEWS REPORTS OF RACIAL BIAS IN REAL ESTATE APPRAISALS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. EIGHTY NINE FORTY EIGHT WILL REQUIRE THE GIRL REAL ESTATE APPRAISERS TO PLACE ON ITS EXISTING COMPLAINT FORM A PLACE FOR BUYERS AND SELLERS FOR WITH PERMISSION THE REAL ESTATE REPRESENTATIVES TO VOLUNTARILY. PROVIDE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. EIGHTY NINE FORTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE THE BUREAU TO COMPILE THE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON OR BEFORE JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IN TERMS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE AN APPLICANT TO FOR PRAISE A LICENSING TO COMPLETE. CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND ELIMINATION OF BIAS TRAINING. FINALLY THIS BILL HAS ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE TO THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT REGARDING DISCRIMINATION IN THE PROVISION OF APPRAISAL SERVICES. MEMBERS FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE HOME IS CONSIDERED TO BE THEIR GREATEST ASSET.

OVER THE PAST YEAR ALONE THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HEADLINE MAKING STORY THE COAL MINERS. BEING LOW BALLED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. DURING THE APPRAISAL PROCESS. THE SPECIALLY TRUE IN PREDOMINANTLY BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS. WHAT A LEGACY OF REDLINING CAN STILL BE FOUND. EIGHTY NINE FOUR EIGHT CERTAINLY DOESN'T ACCOMPLISH A GARGANTUAN TASK. A LIMITING BIAS IN THE APPRAISAL INDUSTRY. BUT THROUGH A SERIES OF THOUGHTFUL PROVISIONS. INCLUDE EXISTING LAW AND WILL WORK TO MAKE BOTH HOME BUYERS AND SELLERS.

THANK YOU SIR CENTER CHULA THANK YOU MR- SENATOR I AM SO PROUD OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY THE FACT IS THAT WE'RE EQUALIZING THE PLAYING FIELD GIVING BOTH BUYER AND SELLER JOB OPPORTUNITY PARTICIPATE IN THE GROWING ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE HOMEOWNERS TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THAT THAT HOME FOR SELLERS TO GORDON TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EQUITY THAT THEY BUILT OVER A LIFETIME. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROPERTY ITSELF IS VIEWED APPRAISED- OF EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN IN SOME CASES BUT DEFINITELY EQUAL TO THE SITUATION OF THE AMENITIES THAT HAS IN THE AMENITIES NOT THE OWNER SO WITH THAT I'D BE HONORED TO BE A- A CO AUTHOR AND I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF US THAT WE'RE GOING FORWARD ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S- TALKING ABOUT. EQUALITY ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY AND- I URGE AND I BUILT THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA SAID ARREGUIN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. MISTER ALL THE NIGHT I RECENTLY. THERE IS A- AN ARTICLE ABOUT MY FORMER MAYOR WHO JUST RECENTLY HAPPENED TO THAT AND THE CITY OF STOCKTON EVERYONE KNOWS SHOULD BE BACK IN THE DAY THERE WAS A CERTAIN LINE THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR COULD NOT LIVE ABOVE COULD NOT TRAVEL ABOVE- AND MAYOR MICHAEL TUBBS WAS RAISED IN THE SOUTH SIDE AND HAVE MOVED INTO- THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOW IS THERE A IS MOVING ON- IN HIS HOME WAS I THINK I GET IT LESS THAN. BEFORE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS THA SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD- CABIN IS ON THE WAY HOME. AT THE END AND THEY WERE JUST THEY WERE SHOCKED AND THEN IT IT IT PREVENTED THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO BUY THE HOME THAT THEY WANT TO BUY. AS FOR THEIR NEXT PLACE BECAUSE IT WAS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE. SO UNDERVALUED AND THEN THE BUYER THEN COULDN'T GET A LOAN- THAT MET THAT APPRAISAL IT WAS A BIT WITH THE ASKING PRICE WAS TOO HIGH SO. AS I WAS READING OVER THAT I THOUGHT WELL. THAT IS INTERESTING AND WOULD HAVE GOT A GREAT. BILL IDEA AND SO. I WAS. PLEASED TO SEE THAT YOU ARE ALREADY WORKING ON IT AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS I THINK THIS IS JUST ANOTHER FORM OF. BEST PRACTICES ANOTHER FORMER REDLINING. IF WE UNDERVALUE WHAT SOMEBODY'S EARNED IN THEIR EQUITY THAN THAT ALSO LIMITS OF WHERE THEIR NEXT HOUSE CAN BE- AND SO ON AND SO ON SO THIS. IS AN ISSUE THAT CAN CONTINUE TO. PASS DOWN TO THE GENERATION pAREA KNOWS UNDER RUBIO'S ALSO WORKED IN THE SPACE- SO ANYWAY. I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN ITS CORE THROUGH THIS. THANK YOU SENATOR. CENTER JONES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND- SUMMER HOLDEN. I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT ON THE CHALLENGES AND- YOU KNOW WHAT MY COLLEAGUES SHARED. I AM A DCA. LICENSEE MYSELF AND- I JUST SPEAKING PERSONALLY BECOME. FRUSTRATED WITH THE CONTINUING EDUCATION- SYSTEM AND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE- FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANNA SEE IN THE IN THE EXAMPLES THAT YOU USE IN THE OTHER EXAMPLES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED HERE ON THE FLOOR THIS MORNING THOSE ARE EGGS REGIS ABUSES OF. POWER REALLY BECAUSE WHEN SOMEBODY'S GIVING THE APPRAISAL THEY HAVE A POWER- IN THAT SITUATION AND. YOU KNOW I THINK MAYBE THOSE NEED TO MOVE IN THAT ARENA- OR THE AREA OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION BY THE BOARDS. I HAVE NOT SUPPORTED CONTINUING EDUCATION- LEGISLATION I WILL I'M NOT GONNA SUPPORT. I'M NOT SUPPORTING THIS BILL EITHER RIGHT AND I MEAN I APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T GET TO END TO THE COMMITTEE ALSO I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN THAT TO. MS BURKE EARLIER- BUT WE HAVE A BOARD- WE HAVE A SUNSET REVIEW THAT I THINK ARE THE PROPER COURSES FOR THE CONTINUED EDUCATION TO BE EXAMINED AND BROUGHT INTO- YOU KNOW APPROVED AND INPUT AND I JUST KIND OF SEE. ON YOU KNOW DIFFERENT SITUATIONS NOT PARTICULARLY THIS ONE BUT YOU KNOW OF OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE'S. MEDDLING INTO THE LICENSING OF DIFFERENT- PROFESSIONS IT I THINK SOMETIMES. WE NEED TO LEAVE THAT EXPERTISE TO THE BOARD AND SO I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY I'M NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT. BECAUSE OF YOU OR BECAUSE OF THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION I'M I'M JUST HAVING A CHALLENGE WITH CONTINUING EDUCATION STUFF- OVERALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JOHN CENTER PARKER DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT QUESTION OR CONCERN. NO I WAS GOING TO WITHDRAW I WOULD I JUST I- SO SEE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE THE MAID AND WE HAD THERE HEARD THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES FROM FROM STOCKTON HERE I THINK THAT WERE VERY. COMPELLING JUDGMENTS AT PRECIADO AUTHOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND LOOKING TO ADDRESS THIS AND I THINK THE ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS IT THROUGH. THE CONTENTS AS ACTUALLY MAKING PEOPLE PHYSICALLY GO THROUGH SOMETHING IS A POSITIVE STEP AND I HOPE IT WORKS AND IF NOT WE'LL COME BACK WITH A MALE STRIPPER REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. AND WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. FIGURE GERMAN I WOULD JUST. SAY THAT I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE COMMENTS AND I THINK THAT IT CERTAINLY IS WHAT UNDER. FANS THE NEED FOR THE SPELL- FIRST AT HOME WITH MY OWN CHIEF OF STAFF. WHO DESCRIBED AN INCIDENT MUCH LIKE. SENATOR EDWARDS IS DESCRIBED WITH THE MAYOR. OF FORMER MAYOR. AND YOU KNOW IT HAPPENS IN A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACH OUT AND GET RECOURSE. TO ADDRESS THE GRIEVANCE- THIS BILL IS A MODEST UP. TO TRY TO DO THAT. AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS CHARGED WITH SUNSET REVIEW. AND THAT THERE IS A PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH THAT- BUT SOMETIMES LIFE HAPPENS IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT DOESN'T LINE UP WITH THE TIMING OF THE SCHEDULED. FOR SUNSET REVIEWS AND SO THE GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE IMPACT THAT IS HAVING TO CALIFORNIANS TODAY AS WE SPEAK. THE COUPLE IN MARIN COUNTY. THEIR HOME ONCE THIS THING WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT AND WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO IS BASICALLY. PRESENT TO THE TO THE APPRAISAL COMMITTEE. THAT THERE WAS A WHITE FAMILY. IT WAS LIVING IN THE HOME. THEY TOOK DOWN EVERYTHING THAT ROOF REFLECTED THEIR ETHNICITY. AND THEN I HAD A FRIEND. STEP IN THE PRICE OF THE HOME WENT FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND APPRAISAL TWO MILLION.

TWELVE NINE SEVEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES- PATIENCE AS WE MAKE OUR WAY TO OUR LAST BILL TODAY WHICH IS A B. TWELVE NINETY SEVEN. TWELVE NINETY NINETY SEVEN WILL CLARIFY THAT I'D BE MAY FINANCE HOUSING AS PART OF AN OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE PROJECT ONLY WHEN THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS REQUIRED. FOR THE OPERATION OF THE PROJECT. ADDITIONALLY NO PART OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT CAN BE FINANCED WITH TAX EXEMPT BONDS TO ENSURE THERE IS NO CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE HOUSING FINANCE PROGRAMS. UNDER CURRENT LAW I BANK IS AUTHORISED TO FINANCE A WIDE VARIETY OF PUBLIC AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS BUT EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES HOUSING WITHOUT DEFINING THE SCOPE. OF THE RESTRICTION OR A CLEAR INDICATION OF WHY. THE ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION ON HOUSING IN THE EYE BANK- CREATES A FINANCING GAP. BUT EXCLUDING ALL PROJECTS THAT CONTAIN ANY ELEMENTS OF HOUSING. FOR EXAMPLE PROJECTS THAT HAVE FACILITY HOUSING OR SHOULD SAY FACULTY HOUSING. FOR SCHOOL'S GROUNDS KEEPERS OR OPERATOR FACILITY SUMMER CAMPS AND YOUTH CAMPS. AND TREATMENT RELATED HOUSING FOR SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT BE FINANCED BY I. BANK. UNDER TWELVE NINETY SEVEN THESE PROJECTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. AS A FINANCIER OF LAST RESORT FOR MANY PROJECTS THIS BILL WILL ALLOW I. BANKS ADD. AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE STATES TO A BELT TO INCREASE MORE TARGETED AND CREATIVE APPROACHES TO HOUSING. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME NUMBERED MEDICINE FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT- WELL HE WILL BE CALLING IN TO GIVE TESTIMONY. I THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SERVICE PRESENT PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MR HOLDEN- I THINK ACT PROVIDES A CRUCIAL FINANCING MECHANISM FOR PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES THAT SOMETIMES INCLUDES AN ELEMENT OF HOW THE- D. A. IS HERE TO SUPPORT A B. TWELVE NINETY SEVEN BECAUSE IT WOULD CLARIFY THE AUTHORITY OF THE I THINK. TO INCLUDE FINANCING PROJECTS WITH HOUSING ELEMENTS WITH THE ELEMENTS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF THE FINANCED PROJECT. THE CLASSIFICATION WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF MOVING PROJECTS ALONG THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN PROHIBITED. A. B. TWELVE NINETY SEVEN MAKES MAKES IT CLEAR THAT NO PART OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT CAN BE FINANCED WITH TAX EXEMPT BONDS. BY CLARIFYING THE TERM HOUSING UNDER THE I THINK ACT THIS BILL EXPANDS HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE WHILE ENSURING THERE'S NO CONFLICT WITH OTHER HOUSING FINANCE PROGRAM. THEREFORE EIGHTY TWELVE NINETY SEVEN WILL BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION AND CREATING MORE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THE CALIFORNIA SO DESPERATELY NEED. AND FOR THESE REASONS THE CALIFORNIA PARDON APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AIBO.

UNDER THIS BILL THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN PERMITTED OTHERWISE. FIFTY PLEASE PUT THE SEVEN MEMBER YES THERE ARE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND MY- THAT INITIAL PRESENTATION IT IS- PROVIDING AS AN EXAMPLE OF FACULTY HOUSING FOR SCHOOLS- GROUNDSKEEPERS FOR OPERATORS OF FACILITIES SUMMER YOUTH CAMPS SO IT'S REALLY A SET THAT REALLY LOOKING AT THE HOUSING BEING SORT OF A AN ANCILLARY PART TO THE DEVELOPMENT SO WHERE THERE'S A IMPORTANT HOUSING IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT THEY CAN BE RIGHT NOW I CAN NOT BE INCLUDED. AND SO WHAT WAS BEEN SEEN WITH THE- ADMINISTRATION- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WERE SEEN OTHER OVER A PERIOD OF TIME IS HOW THE I. BANK- WAS NOT ACTUALLY GETTING. DONE WHAT I THINK OF FOLKS WERE HOPING THAT I COULD ALSO GET DONE FOR HOUSING AND SO. WHEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE ARE POOR BUT IT WAS CHAPTER. I A. B. FIFTY SIX A BILL I AUTHORED IT SORT OF STARTED TO MAKE OUR WAY INTO THE SPACE BY ALLOWING. INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE INCLUDED SO- SEWER LINES COMMUNICATION LINES- US TRAFFIC SIGNAL LINES THINGS OF THAT NATURE COULD. BE UTILIZED FOR HOUSING RELATED BUT THERE AND THIS WAS THE GAP THAT NEEDS TO BE THE NEXT STEP. AND SO NOT TO COMPETE WITH OTHER HOUSING TYPE PROJECTS THAT ARE. MORE EXCLUSIVELY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THIS WAS AT LEAST ALLOWING A LITTLE BIT MORE LATITUDE FOR I. BASIC FUNDS TO BE USED FOR HOUSING RELATED. PROJECTS. I THINK I ALSO LOOK AT IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE- WE TALKED ABOUT SCHOOLS WE HAVE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IN OUR DISTRICT A PASSING CITY COLLEGE. THAT IS LOOKING TO. FIND LAND. THAT THEY COULD BUILD TRANSPORTATION RELATED LIKE PARKING BUT ALSO TO BUILD STUDENT HOUSING. SO IT WOULD MAYBE BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ABOUT TO FIT UNDER THE DEFINITION.

IT WILL SOON BE SIXTEEN MONTHS THAT WE HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE PANDEMIC THAT HAS IMPACTED ALL OF HEALTH CARE.

CARE GIVERS WERE WORKING WITHOUT EMOTIONAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT WHAT KERRY BECAUSE THE NINETEEN PATIENTS THAT WERE CRITICALLY ILL. AND MANY OF WHOM DID NOT SURVIVE. NURSES WERE OPERATING ALL ASPECTS OF CARE THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE PROVIDED. BY SEVERAL CLINICAL SERVICES. AND HELP YOUR WORK WERE TO PUT TWO AREAS AND WORKING OVERFLOWING MANY ICY USE. EITHER SAYS WE'RE ASKED TO CARE FOR COMPROMISED PATIENTS BEYOND THEIR EXPERTISE. BUT FEAR OF MAKING MISTAKES AND PUTTING PATIENTS FURTHER AT RISK BEGAN TO BE A SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL STRESS. HERE REPRISAL AND LOTS OF LIFE INSURANCE THE WINTER MONTHS TO TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WHAT A SOURCE OF CONCERN TO THE WORKFORCE. STORIES OF EXHAUSTION LOTS OF PATIENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE ALLEGED DEPRESSION SUICIDE AND HOPES FORCED NURSES AND OTHER PROVIDERS TO LEAVE THEIR PROFESSION. WITH SHORTAGES AND RETIREMENTS IN MOTION WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LEAVE OUR REMAINING WORKFORCE WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE EMOTIONAL NO AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT. WE NEED THE SAME LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO PROTECT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THOSE THAT ARE STILL WORKING TO CARE FOR PATIENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THAT SAME LEVEL OF COMMITMENT THAT RETURNED ARSES AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS BACK TO THE WORK SITE DAY AFTER DAY DESPITE THE FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY. WE ALL KNOW THE ENDEMIC IT'S STILL WITH US WITH A COMMUNITY DIVIDED AROUND VACCINATIONS AND A MORE CONTAGIOUS AND FASTER SPREADING VIRUS.

THANKS VERY MUCH A CHAIR- SIMILAR FIRST OF ALL I WANT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- BOTH YOU AND- SUMMER FLOOR I MEAN JUST KIND OF IT IS- BECAUSE TREMENDOUS TRAUMA TO. PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES AND HEALTH CARE- AND- AND THAT TRAUMA IS GOING TO BE ONGOING THE PTSD. FROM THAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE PAST YEAR SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I DID I DID JUST WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE DRESSING A FEW OF THE THINGS NOTED IN THE- COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SO- ONE WAS SAY UNDERSTAND THIS BILL. ACTUALLY MAKES IT A MISDEMEANOR FOR. ICE FALLS FIND APPLICATION OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYONE FALSIFIED APPLICATIONS BUT- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SUCH A PENALTY IS APPROPRIATE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE- AND THEN ALSO PERHAPS ALSO SPEAKS- THE TOP IN TERMS OF THE SERVICE IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE AND WOULD THOSE BE. WELL I'D BE CONCERNED IF THEY WERE PAID A LICENSING FEES- BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE READY STRUGGLING WITH- LICENSING FEES GOING UP. AND I DO UNDERSTAND THE DCA DOES HAVE LIKE A MASTER CONTRACT TO HELP FOR THE FRILLS THAT PERHAPS- SOME ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SO IF YOU COULD JUST. SPEAK TO THOSE THINGS THAT PRECEDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TALK ABOUT BEST- IT IS AND THEN- INTRODUCTION THE BILL WAS THAT OF A FELONY- NOW SEVEN MISDEMEANOR BUT HAPPY TO CONTINUE ON TO. FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO GET AT THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE- SUPPORT GOOD ACTORS WHILE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. THAT IS NOT THE DESIRE TO BE PUNITIVE BY ANY MEANS- BUT IT'S BECAUSE IT COUNTED THE PROCESS. I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THE DIGITAL CONVERSATIONS EVEN TO LOWER THE AMOUNT AS WELL TOO A SPECIFIC ON THE ON THE FINES- AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE FEE INCREASE. WE DO NOT DESIRE TO HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL FEE INCREASES AS ALSO LISTED IN ALICE'S SO- WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS MOVING FORWARD. AS WELLS AS DCA TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE THE TYPE OF INTEGRITY WILL NOT PUTTING AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN. A SPECIFICALLY- THE THAT IS THE ISSUE AS IT MISSED DENOUNCES ON THE FISCAL ISSUE- WE HAVEN'T. IDENTIFIED A FISCAL. SOURCE YET BUT THE LESSONS IN THE POLICY WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT NEED. ESPECIALLY PORT AUTHORITY YOUR CONFERENCE. IS ENDING NOW PLEASE HANG UP. THANK YOU SO VERY LOW AND- YEAH I THINK THAT THE ISSUE THE MISDEMEANORS ALSO THAT SOMEONE ACTUALLY NEEDS MENTAL HEALTH. HELP WE DON'T DISCOURAGE THEM BECAUSE IT FROM FROM DOING THAT THINKING THAT MAYBE THERE MIGHT BE A PENALTY IF THEY MISREPRESENT THEMSELVES OR SOMEONE THINKS THAT WAY. THE TIME WITH YOU THINK SOME OF IT I THINK OTHER MECHANISMS STILL FILTER OUT LIKE. THAT AND I'M NOT SURE WHY SOMEONE WOULD TRY TO- YES. THE DETENTION WE FAKED THE SYSTEM MAYBE I'M BEING NAIVE ABOUT THAT BUT- HEY. YOU KNOW I HATE IT I WANT TO BE SURE WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RE HARD ENOUGH FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO ADMIT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. SO WE DON'T WANT. TO MINIMIZE DESPAIRS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU- DOCTOR PAN LET'S TURN TO- CENTER ADMIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESEARCHER I THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL. THE FAMILY MEMBER LOW I GUESS MY ONE QUESTION WOULD BE ONE OF THE- WHAT. AID THERE'S ALREADY A LOT OF EAP PROGRAM SO IF YOU COULD MAYBE IN YOUR CLOTHES JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THIS IS ALREADY. THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED AND I KNOW- THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS YOU KNOW. THINGS BEGAN TO BE ABLE TO DRESSES ISSUE BUT I GUESS AND THEN ANOTHER ONE MY QUESTION IS JUST WHAT I SEE IS SOMEBODY OF AN OMISSION IS THAT. WHAT YOU HAVE ALL THE BOARDS THAT WILL BE COVERED BY THIS AND WELL MY PROFESSION. OR TO BUILD. THAT THE B. B. S. AS IN IN IN THERE. SO I MEAN. THERAPIST AND HEALTH CARE- MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. ALSO NEED. HELP SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT COULD BE A POTENTIAL A MISSION THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO INCLUDE. A COMPASSION FATIGUE ALSO. IMPACTS OF THOSE THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE- THE TRAUMA. OF OTHER CARE GIVERS SO I WOULD JUST UP AND MAKE THAT POINT. ABOUT IF YOU COULD JUST ADDRESS HOW THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE. OUT THERE. AND THEN MAYBE PERHAPS YOUR WILLINGNESS TO. ADD IN THE B. B. S. OR- OR A- THIRD CONVERSATION THAT WAY. WHY NOT. SURE HAPPY TO DO THAT A CLOSE INTERACTION. THANK YOU SENATOR ADMIN CENTER BATES.

PHYLUM NUMBER FOURTEEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK SIR YOU HAVE ONE BILL TO PRESENT TODAY IT IS ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN ZERO TWO PLEASE PROCEED IN READING. HI GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS- AB THIRTEEN OH TWO CODIFIES REGULATIONS THAT THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROLADOR EXPECTED CANNABIS- ADVERTISEMENT ALONG HIGHWAYS- CIVICALLY THIS BILL WILL ALLOW CANNABIS LICENSEES TO ADVERTISE OR MARKET ON THE BILLBOARD ALONG A HIGHWAY. THAT IS FURTHER THAN A FIFTEEN MILE RADIUS FROM THE CALIFORNIA BORDER. AS A COMEDIAN ALICE'S POINTS OUT IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN THE BUREAU ADOPTED REGULATIONS CLARIFY PORTION THE LANGUAGE ADOPTED IN PROP SIXTY FOUR. WITH RESPECT TO BILLBOARD ADVERTISEMENT. LANGUAGE IN PROP SIXTY FOUR STATES THE LICENSEE SHALL NOT ADVERTISE OR MARKET ON A BILLBOARD OR SIMILAR ADVERTISED DEVICES ON THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY THAT CROSSES THE CALIFORNIA BORDER OR ON A STATE HIGHWAY WHICH CROSSES THE CALIFORNIA BORDER. OF COURSE NO STATE HIGHWAY DOES CROSS THE CALIFORNIA BORDER SO THAT'S A VERY HARD ONE TO FIGURE OUT- THE BUREAU CONCLUDED THAT PROP SIXTY FOUR DOES NOT CLARIFY TO WHAT EXTENT SUCH PROHIBITIONS WOULD TAKE PLACE. AND FELT THAT A FIFTEEN MILE RADIUS WAS APPROPRIATE. UNFORTUNATELY THE BUREAU'S REGULATIONS WERE CHALLENGED IN THE ST LOUIS OBISPO COURT- WHICH RULED THAT THE BUREAU LACKED AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT THOSE REGULATIONS. MY SUPPORTERS AND I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE ON THAT POINT UNFORTUNATELY THE INDUSTRY DID NOT KNOW THE COURT. CASE WAS TAKING PLACE AND THEREFORE I WAS NOT ABLE TO APPEAL THE RULING- AND THE RULING WAS THAT ANY INTERSTATE HIGHWAY THAT CROSSES THE BORDER SUCH AS I. EIGHTY. FOR THAT GOES TO THE BORDER LIKE FIFTY- COULD NOT- HAVE- BILLBOARDS- ON IT OR ADJACENT TO IT THAT- WERE ADVERTISING FOR CANNABIS- THE- ON THE OTHER HND ADJACENT HIGHWAYS IN THE BAY AREA WE HAVE TWO EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY THEY DON'T CROSS THE CALIFORNIA BORDER. SO ALL OF THOSE HIGHWAYS- CAN HAVE CANNABIS SCIENCE. SO THE DIFFICULTY WE HAVE HERE'S THERE'S AN ILLICIT MARKET. AND WHAT THOSE BILLBOARDS DID WAS IT GAVE- THE LEGAL ADVICE THE LEGAL MARKET WAY TO ADVERTISE THEIR LOCATION SO THAT PEOPLE KNEW WHERE TO GO TO GET. FULLY INSPECTED- FULLY LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA CANNABIS- AND BECAUSE OF THIS WE'RE ASKING. THAT WE PASS A BILL WHICH WILL. PUT BACK THE- EARLY REGULATION THAT IT'S WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF THE BORDER WE HAVE ASKED THE LAW FIRM THAT WROTE UP. THE REGULATION WHAT WAS MEANT WHEN THEY PUT THIS IN AND NONE OF THEM HAD ANY ARE WRECKED HAD ANY- MEMORY AS TO WHY THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION WAS PUT IN OR HE WHO ASKED THAT IT BE PUT IN. WE BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE ADVERTISING A CALIFORNIA CANNABIS TO STATES THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE A LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET. RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY TWO WITNESSES AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. AND DENNIS LOPER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING ASSOCIATION. I ALSO HAVE RON MEALS ON THE PHONE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT HIGHWAY ADVERTISEMENT.

THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ROB SENATORS GOOD MORNING I AM A DOCTOR WHEN SOBER PEDIATRICIANS CLINICAL PROFESSOR AT UCSF AND SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. AFTER ALMOST FORTY YEARS WORKING TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM HARMFUL PRODUCTS IT IS TERRIBLY SAD TO SEE OUR HARD EARNED LESSONS FROM THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY'S WORKED WITH DICK GENERATIONS OF USE SO EASILY FORGOTTEN. BLANKETING HIGHWAYS WITH ADS FOR CANNABIS IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY WHAT OTHER LOCATIONS CAN AT LEAST TARGETED AUDIENCES THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO BUILD FORGE LEGAL INDUSTRY CAN OPERATE WELL AND PROFITABLY WITHOUT BILLBOARDS FINDING A BUSINESS FROM A LEGAL BUSINESS ON WEEDMAPS IS AS EASY AS CAN BE. AND OTHER STATES DO HAVE A VARIETY OF ADVERTISING RESTRICTIONS ALLOWING CANNABIS BILLBOARDS ON OUR HIGHWAYS BREAKS PROMISES MADE TO THE VOTERS IN PROP SIXTY FOUR THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE NATION'S STRICTEST CHILD PROTECTIONS INCLUDING AD RESTRICTIONS. AND A HIGHWAY BILLBOARD BAN. CANADA'S CAN BROKE FREE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN UNDER THOSE PROJECTS. THIS LED TO ME BAD. ON CALIFORNIA HIGHWAYS EXPOSING MILLIONS OF CHILDREN DAILY ON THEIR WAY TO SCHOOL. AND WE SUCCESSFUL PARENTS SUED AND THE COURT FOUND THE REGULATION TO CONFLICT WITH STATE LAW IN OCTOBER. BILL WILL SHAMELESSLY EXPOSE OUR KIDS AGAIN. IT TOOK DECADES AND LAWSUITS FOR THE TOBACCO MASTER SETTLEMENT TO GET JOE CAMEL THAT WE GREW UP WITH OFFER HIGHLY. WHY LEGISLATE TO BRING BACK HIS CANNABIS COUSIN AND EXPOSE OUR GRANDCHILDREN. WHAT PURPOSE IS SERVED I DIDN'T MAXIMIZING PROFITS. SURE THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF. POLICY SHOULD REPORT THE LEGAL ACCESS BUT NOT MAXIMIZE GROWTH AT ANY COST. OUTDOOR ADVERTISING INCREASES YOU INTEREST IN USE AND POSITIVE. PERCEPTIONS OF HARMFUL PRODUCTS. EVEN JOHN TALKED IN YOUR PEACE HE IS FIFTEEN TO YEAR OLDS IN FIVE STATES INCLUDING OURS FOUND THAT EXPOSURE TO CANNABIS BILLBOARDS HAD A STRONG INSIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. TO FREQUENT USE AND ADDICTION WHAT FACEBOOK OR INSTAGRAM ADS DID NOT TO THE SAME EXTENT. TO SOLVE BILLBOARDS EVEN ONLY OCCASIONALLY AT FIVE TIMES THE OTHER DEVELOPING CANNABIS USE DISORDER OF THOSE WHO NEVER SAW THAT. THOSE WHO SAW THEM FREQUENTLY HAD SIX TIMES THE ODDS THAT CANNABIS USE DISORDER IN SEVEN TIMES FOR FREQUENT USE.

I DIDN'T HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND I KNOW THIS IS THE ON GOING WORK SO I GUESS ONE IS THE HOW IS THERE A TIME LIMIT ON HOW LONG THIS TEMPORARY- LICENSE WILL BE IN PLACE- BECAUSE I THINK IN THE END WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE FULL LICENSES- AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS. THERE'S OF. THAT WHILE THE TEMPER LICENSES THEY ARE YOU KNOW EXPEDITIOUSLY ON THEIR PART- PURSUING- FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENTS OF A FULL LICENSE SO THAT. WAS CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. THE DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE PEOPLE A QUICKER PATHWAY SO THEY CAN. RESUME PRACTICE AND EARN A LIVING HERE IN CITY CALIFORNIA- THAT- THIS THERE'S- ACTUALLY STAYING HERE THAT WERE- MAINTAIN THE STANDARDS THAT OUR STATE HAS ESTABLISHED FOR THE VARIOUS PROFESSIONS. AND THAT- WE'RE TRYING TO. HELP THEM GET. A FULL LICENSE SO THAT- THEY'RE NO LONGER IN. HAVING A TEMPORARY LICENSE. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION THROUGH THE CHAIR- YEAH THESE WERE ALL ISSUES THAT CAME UP WITH AND WE'VE ACTUALLY TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS AND ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS HELPS ADDRESS SOME OF THIS IS THAT- IF THERE IS A CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC EXAM FOR THE APPLICANTS THAT THEY MUST PASS THAT EXAM BEFORE GIVEN THEIR TEMPORARY LICENSE ON THE ISSUE OF THE LENGTH OF THAT LICENSE IT'S TWELVE MONTHS AND SO WANTED TO DO IS GIVE THE DEPARTMENT'S ENOUGH TIME. TO TRANSITION TO THIS TO ALLOW THEM TO GET FULL LICENSURE. CLARIFIED THE TWELVE MONTHS IS THAT TWELVE MONTHS. T. SO IF YOU HAVE A TEMPORARY LICENSE IS ONLY GOOD FOR TWELVE MONTHS CORRECT RIGHT OKAY. AND THEN- AND THEN OF COURSE APPRECIATE THE EXAM PART AND ALSO JUST SORT OF THAT. AND SO SOMEONE WHO IS LICENSED I KNOW HOW PAINFUL IT CANBE TOO SORRY I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND PERHAPS THE FRUSTRATION OF THE SPOUSE OR THE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS THAT THEY MAY HAVE BUT THAT.
