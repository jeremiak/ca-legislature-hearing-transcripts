I REENTRY GRANT PROGRAM IS BEEN

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.898 region:rollup2
AROUND FOR TWO YEARS AND WE'RE

00:19:58.431 --> 00:19:59.732 region:rollup2
EVALUATING THAT NOW.

00:19:58.898 --> 00:20:03.703 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:07.440 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:08.774 region:rollup2
FINANCE.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.476 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:11.811 region:rollup2
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS

00:20:10.476 --> 00:20:13.112 region:rollup2
THAT THE ARTS COUNCILS GRANT

00:20:11.811 --> 00:20:14.880 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS CAN ACHIEVE FOR

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:16.482 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES UP WE

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.317 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THE POST FIVE MILLION

00:20:16.482 --> 00:20:19.952 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IS AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL

00:20:18.317 --> 00:20:21.120 region:rollup2
OF INVESTMENT FOR THE COUNCIL.

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:22.855 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONCERNED THEIR GREATER

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.256 region:rollup2
INFLEXIBLE ENDING MIGHT STRAIN

00:20:22.855 --> 00:20:26.592 region:rollup2
THE OUR COUNCIL'S EXISTING

00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:28.294 region:rollup2
PERSONAL RESOURCES I'M A GREATER

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:29.261 region:rollup2
EMPHASIS ON IN MEANS AN INCREASE

00:20:28.294 --> 00:20:30.563 region:rollup2
IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:31.664 region:rollup2
THAT NEED TO BE PROCESS AN

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.732 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN APPROVALS BEING

00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:34.033 region:rollup2
REPROCESSED.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:36.268 region:rollup2
AN INCREASE IN THE NEED FOR

00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:37.870 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO GRANTEES

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:39.105 region:rollup2
AND ARE ALSO AN INCREASE IN THE

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.272 region:rollup2
NUMBER VALUATIONS OF THE PROGRAM

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:42.241 region:rollup2
SO THEREFORE WE BELIEVE THAT THE

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:42.875 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AN

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.175 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT

00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:45.711 region:rollup2
THIS TIME.

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:46.679 region:rollup2
LL.

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:48.080 region:rollup2
HOW ENCOURAGED HIM AT THE

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:49.115 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.316 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THE LEVEL OF

00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:51.851 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR THE ARTS COUNCIL IS

00:20:50.316 --> 00:20:54.120 region:rollup2
LARGELY MODEL MATTER OF POLICY

00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:55.855 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES FOR THE LEGISLATURE?

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.623 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD KNOW HOWEVER THERE

00:20:55.855 --> 00:20:59.024 region:rollup2
IS RELATIVELY LIVE LIMITED

00:20:57.623 --> 00:21:00.693 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:02.027 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:03.362 region:rollup2
RUN TO THE ARTS COUNCIL.

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:04.497 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE EVIDENCE THAT

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:07.333 region:rollup2
WE DO YOU HAVE.

00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:08.901 region:rollup2
IT ISN'T ALWAYS AS ROBUST AS WE

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:09.468 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE IT IS.

00:21:08.901 --> 00:21:12.404 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:13.973 region:rollup2
AS CREDIBLE AND INDEPENDENT AND

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:15.508 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

00:21:13.973 --> 00:21:17.009 region:rollup2
THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THIS

00:21:15.508 --> 00:21:18.677 region:rollup2
FUNDING WOULD ALLOW FOR SOME

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:21.547 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL EVALUATION.

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:23.115 region:rollup2
BUT JUST A GOOD A WOULD LIKE TO

00:21:21.547 --> 00:21:25.217 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT THE IT THAT THE

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:26.685 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER I'M ASKING

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:28.921 region:rollup2
YOUR ATTEMPTS OF COUNSEL FOR

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:29.889 region:rollup2
SOME MORE DETAILS ON HOW. HOW IN

00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:31.891 region:rollup2
FACT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

00:21:29.889 --> 00:21:33.125 region:rollup2
FUNDING IS CREDIBLE THANK YOU

00:21:31.891 --> 00:21:34.827 region:rollup2
MISTER CHIU?

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:36.529 region:rollup2
I WANT TO JUST OUTSIDE.

00:21:34.827 --> 00:21:37.530 region:rollup2
PORT THE CHAIR OF THE ARTS

00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:39.198 region:rollup2
ENTERTAINED COMMITTEE AND HIS

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.900 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION THAT WE INCREASE OF

00:21:39.198 --> 00:21:41.867 region:rollup2
FUNDING I THINK WE ALL KNOW HOW

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.103 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:46.005 region:rollup2
THE ARTS ARE TO OUR STATE WHEN

00:21:44.103 --> 00:21:47.273 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO OUR EDUCATION WHEN

00:21:46.005 --> 00:21:48.474 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO ECONOMY WHEN IT

00:21:47.273 --> 00:21:50.376 region:rollup2
COMES TO TOURISM.

00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:52.678 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH THE ADVANCES WERE

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:54.113 region:rollup2
SEEN WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND AND

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:55.514 region:rollup2
ARTS PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE WITH

00:21:54.113 --> 00:21:56.982 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WERE FORMALLY

00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:58.117 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED AND THEN OBVIOUSLY

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:59.451 region:rollup2
ARTS FOR ARTS SAKE.

00:21:58.117 --> 00:22:02.087 region:rollup2
THIS IS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE

00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:03.822 region:rollup2
ASSET FOR OUR STATE A IT WASN'T

00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:05.324 region:rollup2
LONG AGO THAT WE AS THE STATE OF

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:06.926 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WERE DEAD LAST IN PER

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:08.460 region:rollup2
CAPITA FUNDING FOR THE ARTS.

00:22:06.926 --> 00:22:10.496 region:rollup2
THINK NOW MOST RECENT ITHACA SO

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.364 region:rollup2
WHERE THIRTY FIFTH AND TRYING TO

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:13.699 region:rollup2
CLIMB UP BUT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:14.934 region:rollup2
BE LEADING THAT AND SO I WOULD.

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:15.968 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AND I DO HOPE IN THE

00:22:14.934 --> 00:22:17.770 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROCESS WILL BE ABLE TO

00:22:15.968 --> 00:22:18.170 region:rollup2
GET THAT NUMBER HIGHER I HAVE TO

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.105 region:rollup2
ADMIT.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.540 region:rollup2
ON HEARING THE PROBLEM FINANCES

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:23.275 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU MAY NOT

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.777 region:rollup2
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CARRY THIS

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:26.812 region:rollup2
OUT. THAT'S A LEGITIMATE

00:22:24.777 --> 00:22:28.480 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BUT IT STRIKES ME

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:30.015 region:rollup2
ARE WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T NEED

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.584 region:rollup2
THAT MANY RESOURCES TO DISPERSE

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.685 region:rollup2
ANOTHER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF

00:22:31.584 --> 00:22:34.119 region:rollup2
FUNDING IF THAT'S A WE GET

00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:36.055 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO. I VERY

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:36.622 region:rollup2
MUCH HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND A WAY

00:22:36.055 --> 00:22:38.257 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS.

00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:40.759 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WITH AN ALMOST NINE

00:22:38.257 --> 00:22:41.393 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:42.761 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SPECKLED

00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:43.963 region:rollup2
BUDGET DUST TO GET US TO A

00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:46.565 region:rollup2
BETTER PLACE SO.

00:22:43.963 --> 00:22:48.200 region:rollup2
I JUST WANTED EXPRESS THAT.

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:49.935 region:rollup2
WITH CARRIER.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.836 region:rollup2
SO I'M I'M THIS IS GOING TO BE A

00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:52.805 region:rollup2
AN ITEM THAT'S GOING TO BE HELD

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:55.841 region:rollup2
OPEN AYE AYE ONE AT SECOND WHAT.

00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:57.610 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUE SAID HOWEVER MY

00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:59.678 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN MANY GRANT

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.715 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IS THAT THOSE THAT KNOW

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:03.382 region:rollup2
HOW TO GET THE MONEY ARBOR EXIT

00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:04.783 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL AND THOSE THAT DON'T.

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:06.252 region:rollup2
AREN'T VERY SUCCESSFUL AND SO

00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:07.453 region:rollup2
RURAL COMMUNITIES TEND NOT TO

00:23:06.252 --> 00:23:08.988 region:rollup2
GET VERY MUCH AND WHEN THEIR

00:23:07.453 --> 00:23:11.590 region:rollup2
STATE LIMITED STATE RESOURCES SO

00:23:08.988 --> 00:23:12.057 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO KNOW. JUST IN TERMS

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.125 region:rollup2
OF YOUR GRANT PROGRAM.

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:15.094 region:rollup2
.

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:17.329 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW HOW HAVE YOU

00:23:15.094 --> 00:23:19.531 region:rollup2
ENSURED THAT THERE'S A.

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:22.001 region:rollup2
BROAD BASE OF OF.

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:24.036 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES

00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:25.471 region:rollup2
IT MAY NOT A AND I I'VE HAD A

00:23:24.036 --> 00:23:26.972 region:rollup2
SERIES OF OF BUT CAN

00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:28.307 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS AND IN

00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:30.075 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF ON THE OUTS

00:23:28.307 --> 00:23:32.544 region:rollup2
FOR SOME KIND OF ARTS PROGRAM.

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:34.113 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I LOOK AT IN IN THAT

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:35.981 region:rollup2
COUNTY OF MONTEREY THAT ARTS

00:23:34.113 --> 00:23:37.283 region:rollup2
MONEY THAT GOES OUT THE MAJORITY

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:38.417 region:rollup2
OF IT GOES TO THE MONTEREY

00:23:37.283 --> 00:23:39.952 region:rollup2
PENINSULA.

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:41.253 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO THE SALINAS

00:23:39.952 --> 00:23:42.921 region:rollup2
VALLEY AND SO I'M VERY

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:44.523 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN IN TRYING TO MAKE

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:45.824 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE END UP ON

00:23:44.523 --> 00:23:49.695 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTING FUNDS AS BROADLY AS

00:23:45.824 --> 00:23:51.897 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

00:23:49.695 --> 00:23:53.265 region:rollup2
SO I AM FIRST OF ALL I I COME TO

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:55.968 region:rollup2
THIS AGENCY WEARING THE RURAL

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:58.404 region:rollup2
ADVOCACY HAT. AND THEM I AM VERY

00:23:55.968 --> 00:23:58.671 region:rollup2
PLEASED TO WEAR IT IT'S ALSO THE

00:23:58.404 --> 00:24:01.740 region:rollup2
NEA SEE.

00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:03.609 region:rollup2
CAO FOCUS TO HELP US REACH

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.744 region:rollup2
RURAL COMMUNITIES I THINK IT'S

00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:08.080 region:rollup2
VITAL WHEN I SAY THAT WE SHOULD.

00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:10.382 region:rollup2
HAVE A PRESENCE IN ALL FIFTY

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.984 region:rollup2
EIGHT COUNTIES IF I FEEL THAT

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:13.919 region:rollup2
VERY STRONGLY I DON'T KNOW HOW

00:24:11.984 --> 00:24:16.021 region:rollup2
TO EMPHASIZE IT MORE THAN SAY.

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:17.489 region:rollup2
THEIR OF CENTER FOLKS OUT IN OUR

00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:18.724 region:rollup2
STATE THAT ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:20.125 region:rollup2
DISPOSSESSED FROM.

00:24:18.724 --> 00:24:21.760 region:rollup2
LARGE URBAN AREAS FROM THE

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:23.662 region:rollup2
COAST AND THEY DESERVE OUR

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:27.132 region:rollup2
ATTENTION JUST AS MUCH AS

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:28.233 region:rollup2
ANYBODY ELSE.

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:28.934 region:rollup2
IN THE.

00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:30.602 region:rollup2
AND ADD THAT PART OF OUR

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:32.338 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IN IN OUR RESEARCH IS

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:33.839 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY HOW WE CAN REACH

00:24:32.338 --> 00:24:34.306 region:rollup2
THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE GOING TO

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:35.240 region:rollup2
BEEF UP OUR TECHNICAL

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.675 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.043 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SOME WORKSHOPS AND OTHER

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:39.878 region:rollup2
ACCESS POINTS TO OUR GRANTS

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:41.447 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:42.915 region:rollup2
BEEN USING A CERTAIN WAYS THAT

00:24:41.447 --> 00:24:44.650 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO ADDRESS.

00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:46.752 region:rollup2
AND IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.953 region:rollup2
HAVE FAR REACHING. YOU KNOW THAT

00:24:46.752 --> 00:24:49.488 region:rollup2
WE REACH ALL OF THE AREAS OF THE

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:50.823 region:rollup2
STATE THEY NEED THE SUPPORT.

00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:52.324 region:rollup2
THE EAGLES INFORMATIONAL HOW THE

00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:53.258 region:rollup2
LAST GRANTS WERE DISPERSED IF

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:54.159 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO RURAL COMMUNITIES

00:24:53.258 --> 00:24:56.028 region:rollup2
AT ALL THEY DID.

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:57.229 region:rollup2
AND.

00:24:56.028 --> 00:24:58.464 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY DID GO TO RURAL

00:24:57.229 --> 00:25:00.232 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHO ARE WE HAVE AN

00:24:58.464 --> 00:25:01.567 region:rollup2
EDUCATION PROCESS

00:25:00.232 --> 00:25:02.301 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT FIRST OF ALL WE TRY

00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:03.602 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:05.070 region:rollup2
APPLICATION PROCESS IS WELL

00:25:03.602 --> 00:25:06.505 region:rollup2
KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.006 region:rollup2
THEN WE HAVE AN ADJUDICATION

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:11.744 region:rollup2
PROCESS WHERE WE A PANELIST

00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:14.847 region:rollup2
SITTING. ON IT ON THE OTHER.

00:25:11.744 --> 00:25:16.915 region:rollup2
ON THE PANEL SETS REDUNDANT BUT.

00:25:14.847 --> 00:25:18.283 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY.

AREAS THEY'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE

00:25:36.402 --> 00:25:40.372 region:rollup2
PROCESS THEY GO BACK TO THEIR

00:25:38.103 --> 00:25:42.408 region:rollup2

WOULD HELP. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:53.652 region:rollup2
AND WITH THE SAME PROBLEM THE

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:55.721 region:rollup2
FOR THE BIGGER CITIES TO GET

00:25:53.652 --> 00:25:57.756 region:rollup2

00:25:57.756 --> 00:25:59.992 region:rollup2
HELPFUL TO THINK WE WILL DO

THAT.

00:25:59.992 --> 00:26:05.030 region:rollup2
A GOING UP. MISTER CHOI.

00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:06.698 region:rollup2
OKAY IN CONCEPT I WOULD ALSO A

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.467 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT UP BUT IF YOU WITH

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:11.603 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE. LOOKING AT

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:12.704 region:rollup2
THE PAST OF THREE YEARS SO FAR

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:17.743 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES SO.

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:19.645 region:rollup2

THAT IS SO. LOWEST OF FUNDING

00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:26.385 region:rollup2
AND THEN I THINK OF TIPPING OFF

00:26:24.383 --> 00:26:28.520 region:rollup2
SCHOOL WHIMS IN SPORTS IS A VERY

00:26:26.385 --> 00:26:31.190 region:rollup2
VERY. IMPORTANT.

UP I ONE DAY FOR TEN MILLION

00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:02.721 region:rollup2

00:27:00.152 --> 00:27:04.790 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE. IN NOW MORE FUNDING

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:07.226 region:rollup2

WHIMS RIGHT. CAN I AM SO THE KEY

00:27:07.226 --> 00:27:10.162 region:rollup2
PARTS IN SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE

00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:12.598 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY TAX

00:27:10.162 --> 00:27:14.566 region:rollup2
A CHECK OFF OF FUND SO THAT IS

00:27:12.598 --> 00:27:16.702 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW TAX FUN AND THAT WE

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:17.603 region:rollup2

THE TURBO TAX.

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:23.542 region:rollup2
MESSAGING SO WAS A LITTLE BIT

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.245 region:rollup2
OF DEPTH THAT'S BEEN CORRECTED

00:27:23.542 --> 00:27:27.279 region:rollup2
SO WE WILL BE CONTINUING TO. TO

00:27:26.245 --> 00:27:29.148 region:rollup2
GO OUT AND GET REVENUES FROM

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:30.516 region:rollup2

00:28:16.128 --> 00:28:19.364 region:rollup2
.

00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:20.532 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE OBVIOUSLY GENERAL FUND

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:21.600 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT THE OTHER ONE IS?

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:22.034 region:rollup2
?

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.737 region:rollup2

THIS A GRANT APPLICATION ON

00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:32.144 region:rollup2
LOCAL BASIS RIGHT SO OUR

00:28:30.576 --> 00:28:33.912 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM COMES

00:28:32.144 --> 00:28:36.148 region:rollup2
THROUGH GENERAL FUND FROM THE

TO RUN OUR ARTS IN CORRECTIONS

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.166 region:rollup2

GRANTS PROGRAM FEELS ARE ALL

00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:58.737 region:rollup2

AND INSTITUTIONS.

00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:07.980 region:rollup2
WITHIN CDC ARE SO IT'S VERY

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:09.448 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAT'S OUR

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.649 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS

00:29:09.448 --> 00:29:12.184 region:rollup2

00:29:12.184 --> 00:29:14.419 region:rollup2
FIVE MINUTE MILLION DOLLAR

00:29:13.252 --> 00:29:15.554 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT TO OUR GRANTS PROGRAM

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:18.290 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

00:29:15.554 --> 00:29:18.890 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT CEREMONY.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.993 region:rollup2
