DO YOU WANT TO COME PERCENT SB EIGHT WELCOME SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS -- WELCOME TO THE NEW YEAR -- AS MANY OF YOU REMEMBER AND I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME NEW MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE. I PRESENTED A SIMILAR BILL -- TO BAN SMOKING IN STATE PARKS AND BEACHES AND IN PREVIOUS YEARS. AS THE ANALYSIS NOTES -- THAT ALTHOUGH THE MEASURE DID PASS THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED IT -- FOR A SECOND TIME AT LEAST AS IT RELATES TO MY MY WORK IN THIS AREA -- BUT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD PROHIBIT SMOKING AT A UNIT OF THE STATE PARKS SYSTEM AND MAKE IT INFRACTION. PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. THE PROHIBITION WOULD ONLY BE ENFORCED AFTER SIGNS HAD BEEN POSTED. THIS BILL AUTHOR AUTHORIZES THE DIRECTOR OF PARKS AND REC TO DESIGNATE AREAS IS EXEMPT FROM THE SMOKING PROHIBITION. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION TOBACCO KILLS OVER FORTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EVERY YEAR. SECONDS MORE AND COST THE STATE. MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN HEALTHCARE MEDICARE OUT. MEDICAID IN LOST PRODUCTIVITY. ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF SMOKING AND HEALTH CARE COSTS THE STATE ARE WELL KNOWN. A RECENT STATEWIDE POLL CONDUCTED BY THE LONG ASSOCIATION. SO THAT 71% OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT POLICIES THAT PROHIBIT EXPOSURE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE. IN AREAS FREQUENTLY REGULATED BY THE PUBLIC. BUT SMOKING ALSO HARMS THE ENVIRONMENT CIGARETTE **** ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF WASTE LETTER. CIGARETTES ALSO BECAUSE WILD FIRES ACCORDING TO CAL FIRE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIRES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SMOKING SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN BANNING SMOKING IN STATE PARKS IS THE NEXT STEP IN ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING. THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK. OUR FEAR AYE VOTE IN SB EIGHT AND I HAVE WELL TIM GIPSON THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY. AND RICO MASTER DON ON'T MISTER BROWSER FOR ME I'M SO BAD. THE NADA VOSTRO DID NOT OF FROM THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD WELCOME [inaudible] THE STATE. MORNING MR CHEN MEMBERS MY NAME IS TIM GIVES AND I'M WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB. EIGHT SMOKING IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE DEATH IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN LUNG CANCER KILLS OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EVERY YEAR. AND OVERALL ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE DEATHS. A THREE CANCER DEATHS IS DUE TO TOBACCO. THE US SURGEON GENERAL DECLARED THAT THERE'S NO RISK FREE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE. EVEN BRIEF EXPOSURE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE HAS IMMEDIATE ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN. EACH YEAR OVER THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED NONSMOKING ADULTS THE UNITED STATES WILL DIE OF LUNG CANCER IS ROLE OF BREEDING. SECONDHAND SMOKE SECOND SMOKE IS SPECIALLY HAZARDOUS TO CHILDREN INDIVIDUALS WITH ASTHMA AND OTHER CHRONIC ILLNESS ILLNESSES PREGNANT WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY SO THE MAJORITY OF OUR COASTLINES RT SMOKE FREE DUE TO THE DILIGENT. WORK OF CITIES AND COUNTIES ONE GLARING OMISSION IS OUR STATE BEACHES. THERE MORE THAN SIXTY SEVEN MILLION. PEOPLE UTILIZE THE STATE PARK SYSTEM EVERY YEAR AND THOSE GUESTS WHO VISIT THE BEST OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT HAVE THEIR EXPERIENCE RUINED BY HAVING A PRE THE HEALTHIER. SMOKE FREE POLICIES LIKE HIS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IMPROVE HEALTH AND REDUCE OVERALL SMOKING. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE WE THINK OUR STATE. PARKS AND BEACHES SHOULD BE VISUALLY BREATHTAKING NOT LITERALLY BREATHTAKING SO. WE REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THE SUPPORT LEGISLATION. ANSWER. RITA WELCOME AND THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS RECALL MONSTER TO NOT A WHAT THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND WANT TO THANK SENATOR GLAZER -- FOR PURSUING THIS -- POLICY I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND AS HE AND TEN JUST MENTIONED -- CIGARETTE SMOKE IS WELL DOCUMENTED AS A NEGATIVE IMPACT DANGEROUS DEATHLY IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH. BUT THERE ARE DANGEROUS LONG AFTER THEY ARE DISCARDED -- THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TOXIC CHEMICALS IN CIGARETTES OF BOX. ON THEY END UP GETTING CONSUMED BY WILDLIFE -- WHETHER THAT'S BIRDS OR ISH I WHICH I'VE PERSONALLY SEEN -- THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CONSUMED TO BE DANGEROUS THEY LEACH INTO THE WATER THEY WHICH LEACH INTO WATER SUPPLY THEY ARE DANGEROUS TO THE THE WATER QUALITY -- FOR HUMAN 20% OF OUR GARBAGE ON THE BEACH IS CIGARETTE **** AND AS MENTIONED THAT BECAUSE WILD FIRES -- OUR STATE PARKS ARE PART OF A NATURAL SYSTEM THAT IS PART OF A NINETY BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL OUTDOOR ECONOMY -- WILDFIRES ARE DANGEROUS AND OBVIOUSLY DEADLY ON FOR AS WE'VE UNFORTUNATELY SEEN LAST YEAR BUT THEY ARE AN IMPACT TO OUR ECONOMY AS WELL SO I RICHER.

GOOD MORNING JAMIE MORGAN ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK. GOOD MORNING WHEN THE RATE IS FOR THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT SO MUCH. KATHY BURKE WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS PART. MINUTES AGAIN THOUGHTS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHAEL INTO IMPRISON THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARK RANGERS SOCIAIS XIN. THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARK RANGERS OF STATION SUPPORTS A BAN ON SMOKING IN CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS. WE HAVE ONE CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. AND THAT IS WE'RE COMING FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF THE RANGER IN THE FIELD HAVING TO ENFORCE THIS ENFORCEABILITY. THE BILL IS CURRENTLY REAL -- WRITTEN ALLOWS -- A EXEMPTION FOR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. RELIGIOUS BELIEF IS A NEBULOUS ITEM -- IT'D BE VERY HARD FOR A RANGER IN THE FIELD TO DETERMINE WHAT A PERSON'S BELIEF IS WHICH IS REALLY A SELF EXPRESSION. WE KNOW THAT RELIGIOUS BELIEFS HAVE THE FULL GAMUT EVEN THINGS THAT ARE TOTALLY LEGAL. MULTIPLE WIVES AND THINGS WITH THE YOU'LL BE VERY DIFFICULT IN FACT COULD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE. TO ENFORCE THIS LAW. IF SOME. TO FIND A SMOKING AREA I'M TALKING ABOUT THE NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF REGULAR SMOKERS. NOT THOSE WHO ARE PRACTICING A RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. FOUND OUT AND THEY WOULD THROUGH THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THE MAGIC WORDS IS SMOKING'S A PART OF MY RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. THE RANGER IN THE FIELD WE HAVE NO WAY. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE IT'S A BELIEVE. IT'S NOT A PRACTICE OR CEREMONY WHICH IS ALSO IN THE BILL FOR INSTANCE -- WELL. SO IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT. NONE OF THE CURRENT SMOKING BANS THAT WE RESEARCH HAVE A RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION OF THIS TYPE. FOR INSTANCE IF THAT EXEMPTION WAS WRITTEN INTO THE LAW THAT PROHIBITS SMOKING IN THE BUILDING AND SOMEONE LIT UP IN THE AUDIENCE. AND THE SERGEANT OF ARMS WAS ASKED. TO HAVE THEM LEAVE WORK QUIT SMOKING. AND THEY COULD SAY IT'S MY RELEASE BELIEVE THE SERGEANT ARMS WOULD HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. AFTER TRAINING WHAT THAT MEANT. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS LANGUAGE WOULD LEAD VERY QUICKLY TO US SORT OF MAGIC WORD THING RELIGION IS MY BELIEF -- ALSO PART APARTMENT CURRNTLY HAS QUITE A FEW LAWS RULES AND REGULATIONS ON THE CONDUCT PEOPLE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS. WE HAVE A WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF PERMITTING THAT ALLOWS EXCEPTIONS TO THAT AND THERE'S THOUSANDS OF THEM. IT IS EVERYTHING FROM GROUND FIRES -- LOUD MUSIC RELIGIOUS OR OTHERWISE AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER ACTIVITIES. THESE PERMITS ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT. TO LOOK AT THE ACTIVITY SAY A PERSON WANTS TO HAVE AN EVENT WITH. LOUD AMPLIFIED MUSIC THEY CAN'T DO IT ORDINARILY BUT WITH THE PROPER PERMIT IN THE PROPER PLACE IN TIME THEY CAN WHETHER IT'S RELIGIOUS OR OTHERWISE SO. WE HAVE THE SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE. WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE. THE WAY TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WITH THIS IS. JUST THAT YOU KNOW ONE TENTH OF A PERCENT. SO WE'RE PROPOSING AS IT'S ALREADY IN THE BILL FOR FILMING. THAT THE LANGUAGE BE AS PROPERLY PERMITTED [inaudible] ALTERNATIVELY. EVEN TAKING OUT THE WORD BELIEF AND JUST SLOUGHING RELIGIOUS CEREMONY WE LOVE THE RANGER IN THE FIELD TO INTERACT WITH THE PERSON SAY OKAY WHAT'S YOUR MONEY IS THIS RIGHT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU JUST SMOKING. TELL ME ABOUT THAT CEREMONY MAKE SOME JUDGMENT WHETHER IT'S LEGITIMATE OR NOT BUT IF THE PERSON SAYS I JUST BELIEVE IT. THEIR STOCK. SO WE ASK THE COMMITTEE. TO CONSIDER ONE OF THOSE TWO OPTIONS IN THIS BILL SO THAT IN THE FIELD WHEN THE RANGERS ARE OUT THERE TRYING TO ENFORCE IT. THEY CAN CARRY OUT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. OTHER I GUESS WE'LL REGARD USE A TWEENER [inaudible] OPPOSITION [inaudible] THAT'S MAY. I'M SCOTT SAME PLAYS WE'RE NOT YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT AS OPPOSED YOU'RE NOT. OPPOSED USE AND SMOKING GOT. GOT IT BUT THIS IS OPPOSITION I AM NOT OPPOSED TO THE SMOKING BAN I WROTE THE SMOKING BAN. WHAT I'M OPPOSED TO IS THIS -- LESS THAN EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION A CERTAIN SENATOR DECIDED TO DO -- USE RATHER THAN THE GOOD STAFF. OKAY -- I I GOT TWO PROBLEMS. TWO MAIN PROBLEMS HERE WITH THIS LEGISLATION AGAIN I WROTE THE LEGISLATION THE ORIGINAL. STATE PARKS SMOKING BAN LEGISLATION TO STATE YOUR NAME IN LIGHTS I DID I'M SCOTT SAME PLACE. FROM NO WHERE I'M JUST SOME GUY THAT WROTE THE LEGISLATION IT WAS CARRIED ORIGINALLY AND AND TWENTY SIXTEEN BY MARTY BLOCK. JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP THIS THIS HEARING IN ORDER TO START OUT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY TESTIMONY BECAUSE MINE IS AS VALID AS ANYBODY I WROTE THE LEGISLATION? I UNDERSTAND SIR WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO REFRAIN FROM CALLING OUT THE THE AUTHOR -- INTENT OKAY OVERALL REFRAIN FROM THAT I I HAVE TWO PROBLEMS TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS THE FIRST ONE BEING IN THE UP TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FINE -- FOR VIOLATION THAT'S TOO LOW. WHEN I WROTE THIS IT WAS UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND? IT WAS UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR FINE WHICH IS ONLINE WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE LITERAL I FIND. OKAY -- I'M NOT WORK IF THERE'S SOME PEOPLE IT WILL SAY THE UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IS TO PUNITIVE. OKAY I'M TRYING TO DISSUADE PEOPLE FROM SMOKING IF A CIGARETTE SMOKER THINKS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HIT WITH A POTENTIAL FINE OF UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. THEY'RE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO SMOKE THAN IF THEY THINK THIS THAT THE FINE IS A MERE UP TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. AND BY MY COMPARED TO OTHER STATE PARKS SMOKING FINDS THE OREGON STATE PARKS THEY'RE FINE IT'S UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. NEW JERSEY STATE PARK START AT TWO IN HAWAII STATE PARKS SMOKING BAN THE FINE THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A SET AMOUNT THERE. OKAY SO -- THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR AMOUNT YOU'RE GOING TO GET PEOPLE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE THEY CATCH TO TO GET HAVE TO PAY. EXORBITANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY I JUST DON'T WANT THEM TO SMOKE THE TWENTY FIVE DAHLE XRAY DRIVE FIVE DOLLAR FINE IS NOT THE PROPER SHOW OF FORCE. THAT'S THAT'S ALMOST ENTRAPMENT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT OKAY -- THE WHOLE RELIGIOUS BELIEF EXEMPTION. I JUST CREATES A MASSIVE LOOPHOLE TO AT SOME IT'S IT'S JUST A SEA OF GRAY AREA. WHAT I SEE IS A RELIGIOUS BELIEF MIGHT NOT BE WHAT HE CAESAR'S OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF WHICH MIGHT NOT BE WHAT SHE SEES AS A RELIGIOUS BELIEF? WHO DEFINES THAT ULTIMATELY YOU REALLY CAN'T IT'S JUST TOO SUBJECTIVE SO YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE A MASSIVE BURDEN -- FOR ARE ALREADY OVERWORKED AND UNDERSTAFFED STATE PARK RANGERS. AND IF IF YOU CAN'T ENFORCE THIS THING NOT ONLY IS IT GOING TO BE A WASTE OF OUR START STATE PARK RANGERS TIME THIS WILL BE A WASTE OF MONEY FOR EVERY TAXPAYER HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR ITS ESTIMATED SIGNAGE AN INFLAMMATION IS GOING TO COST SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A MILLION DOLLARS I'M SURE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD BETTER USE ELSEWHERE. AM I OPPOSED TO THE STATE PARKS SMOKING BAN ABSOLUTELY NOT AND MY A CRAP POSTED THIS CURRENT LANGUAGE YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I WILL RESERVE THAT FOR THE MEMBERS HERE VERY GOOD THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THE ROBUST TESTIMONY. WILL WILL -- BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE MEMBERS DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YES SENATOR ALLEN. IS WANTED TO WE HEARD FROM THE FOLKS WHO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE ON THE LINE TRYING TO ENFORCE THESE RULES THAT WE PASS YOUR FROM SACRAMENTO. AND I WANTED TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE STATE OF YOUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE STATE PARK RANGERS ASSOCIATION. AND HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT GO TO THE TROUBLE OF GETTING THIS I MEAN THIS IS YOU KNOW A THIRD ATTEMPT. TO GET ACROSS THE FOURTH ATTEMPT DOWN TO GET CROCUS OF STILL. EVERY WHAT THE TROUBLE AGAIN OF OF THIS BILL HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE -- HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT IF IT ACTUALLY IS PASSED ANDSIGNED INTO LAW? THE FOLKS WHO ARE AND YOU KNOW. IT CHARGED WITH WITH WITH CARRYING IT OUT. FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THE GIVES THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO MEET THE GOALS THAT. YOU HAVE. THE CHAIR YES A THANK YOU THAT CENTER ALLEN THANKS HERE -- THOUGHTFUL -- INQUIRY I WOULD NOTE A COUPLE THINGS FIRST DIED IN THE LAST TWO VERSIONS OF THIS LEGISLATION THERE WAS NEVER AN ISSUE RAISED ON THIS POINT AND BY THE WAY. I WAS GONNA PUT IT MY CLOTHES BUT KUDOS TO SENATOR MARTY BLOCK WHO WAS THE ORIGINAL CARRIER OF THIS BILL -- BEFORE HE LEFT THE THE SENATE AND I'VE TAKEN THAT ABSENCES DEPARTURE BUT HE WAS THE ONE WO IS IT. ATTEMPTED TO ADVANCE THIS IN PREVIOUS YEARS I'VE DONE AT THE LAST TWO SESSIONS -- BUT BUT THESE ISSUES WERE NEVER REYES BEFORE I I THINK THE CONCERN IS OVERBLOWN -- BUT NEVER THE LESS THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE PARKS DEPARTMENT TO FIND AT A WAY -- TO DEAL WITH THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED I THINK THAT TIED. AT IO. WHEN WE HAVE ENACTED SMOKING BANS IN LOTS OF PLACES IN OUR STATE OUT RARELY AND WE EVER YOU KNOW? HEARD OF ENFORCEMENT ISSUES -- CERTAINLY NOT RELATED TO THE FINAL THE FIGHT HAS BEEN HIGH AND IT HAS BEEN LOW AND WE SUGGESTED THAT TO TRY TO FIND THE BALANCE AMONG OUR ARE A THOUGHTFUL LEADERS THAT ARE MOVING THE BILL FOR THOSE OF THE RELIGIOUS BELIEF ISSUE. YEAH SO BUT ON THE RELIGIOUS BELIEF AND HAPPY. TO TO TO TALK WITH PART PARKS AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO TRY TO WORK THAT. THAT ISSUE OUT -- GOING FORWARD -- DAVE REYES THEY DIDN'T RAISE IN THE OBJECTION LETTER THAT I SAW. I WISH I JUST SAW THE YESTERDAY -- THEY DIDN'T AS SUGGEST AS THE SPEAKER DID AT SOME PERMIT POLICY IS SOMEWHERE AROUND IT. NOR DID I HEAR -- THE SUGGESTION ABOUT. LIMITING THE WORD BELIEVING AND MAINTAINING THE WORD CEREMONIES OF THESE ARE NEW THINGS TO ME AND I'D LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO WORK WITH THEM TO TRY TO ADVANCE OUR MUTUAL GOALS. VERY GOOD. THANKS A CENTER REMINDING THEM COMMERCENTRE JONES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN. WELCOME TO YOUR CHAIRMANSHIP I THINK THIS IS OUR FIRST HEARING. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS PERSISTENCE I SHARE THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL. OBJECTIVES BUT SURE SOME OF THE JUST CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS OF DRAFTING IN CRAFTING IN ENFORCEMENT. MAYBE JUST A LITTLE MORE YOUR THOUGHTS. ON THE RELIGIOUS. BELIEF EXEMPTION IN YOUR VIEW HOW WOULD THAT BE ENFORCED BY A RANGER IN A PARK WHO COMES ACROSS SOMEBODY -- LOOKING AT THE SUNSET. SMOKING A CIGARETTE. I WILL FIRST AS YOU KNOW PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS TRYING TO BALANCE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE. TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN TYPES OF FIVE OF FIVE RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES AND JUDGMENT CALLS ARE MADE ALL THE TIME. IN OUR WORLD. I IN THE SPACE -- CITATION IS ISSUED IN ITS CHALLENGE FOR GROUNDS IN WHICH THEY ARE PROCESS DID YOU TWO CASES. BUT I A A I I THINK IT'S VERY NARROW I THINK IT'S SENSITIVE -- TO TO OUR TRIBES AND OTHER. FOLKS WHO --% USED TOBACCO -- IN RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES I THINK IT'S THE THE WITH THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE -- BUT I ANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO IT THAT'S WHY IT'S IN THE BILL AS IT'S BEEN WRITTEN AND HOW ABOUT CANNABIS USE FROM. CANNABIS WITH WOULD BE TREATED THE SAME AS TOBACCO USE -- UNDER THIS BILL. I MEAN I SHARE THE CONCERN OF THE STATE PARK RANGER REPRESENTATIVE. IF IT'S SIMPLY BASED. ON AN EXEMPTION FOR RELIGIOUS BELIEF WITHOUT ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION. WORD WILL TRAVEL PRETTY QUICKLY IF YEAR ACCOSTED BY ARRANGER JUST SAY YOU SMOKE AS PART OF A RELIGIOUS BELIEF -- NOW THOSE SMOKING CANNABIS MAY SAY THEY'RE RASTAFARIANS IN THERE GONNA HAVE. THE STRONG ARGUMENT IN COURT PERHAPS. BUT I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT AN ALLY IN THE STATE PARK RANGERS AND IF THERE'S A WAY TO TIGHTEN. THE RELIGIOUS BELIEF EXEMPTION -- AS WAS SUGGESTED IT'S PART OF THE CEREMONY -- OR THERE HAS TO BE SOME FURTHER ARTICULATION AND JUST SAYING IT'S MY RELIGIOUS BELIEF. BECAUSE OTHERWISE I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE HUGE ENFORCEMENT BURDEN AND WE WON'T ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE THE UC IN THE BILL SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT WITH YOUR COMMITMENT THAT YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE. TO COORDINATE WITH THOSE THAT ARE GONNA BE ON THE FRONT LINES OF ENFORCEMENT. YES CENTER HAPPY HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AS I SAID I HEARD THEIR OBJECTION JUST RECENTLY. AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM TO TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHETHER IT IF IT'S A PERMITTING PROCESS IF IT'S A REPLACEMENT OF THE WORD BELIEF WITH SOMETHING ELSE THAT -- CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BILL TO HAPPEN AFFECTS WILL BE BOTH MUTUALLY. ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A QUESTION FOR ONE OF THE WITNESSES IT MR MASTERED IN AUTUMN YES DOES IT PROPERLY. STATE YOU HAD A STATISTIC IN YOUR IN YOUR TESTIMONY -- REGARDING -- I THINK YOU SAID 20% OF BEACH LOOKING RESTATE THAT -- STATISTIC FOR ME PLEASE. 20% ONE IN FIVE THAT CAN WRITE OFF OF FACTS YOU OF BILL. 20% WHAT. 20% OF THE BUT GARBAGE THAT PICKED UP OFF THE BEACH DURING BIG BEACH CLEANUP IS CIGARETTE ****. NOW IS SO WHEN YOU SAY SUPERVISOR 20% OF THE LITTER ON THE BEACH DO YOU MEAN BY. WEIGHT BY VOLUME BY ITEM THAT MY NUMBER OF ITEMS. BY NUMBER OF ITEMS OKAY I JUST THAT THAT. STATISTIC WAS PECULIAR TO ME SO THANK YOU FOR FOURTH COULD COUNT CLEAN UP FOR ME. OKAY VERY GOOD. WE WE FLOWED INTO OPPOSITION THERE I JUST WANTED BEFORE WE WE WRAP UP HERE I DID WANT TO GIVE OPPORTUNITY IF THERE IS ANY ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION YOU KNOW IF A THOROUGH AIRING HERE. OKAY -- SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE DICE -- I'M SPORTING A BILL TODAY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING FORWARD AGAIN. FOURTH TIMES THE CHARM PERHAPS -- I DID WANT TO NOTE. IT'S NOT JUST A RELIGIOUS BELIEF IT'S THE THE THE THE SECTIONS SAYS A A GOOD FAITH PRACTICE. OF A RELIGIOUS BELIEFS SO TERMS OF THE ROADMAP GOING FORWARD AND HOW TO NAVIGATE FEASIBILITY ENFORCEMENT. A GOOD FAITH PRACTICE MAY BE A HIGHER THRESHOLD THAN JUST SIMPLY -- I'M YOUR STATEMENT -- THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS TO SORT OF MANAGE THAT WITHOUT IMPEDING ON FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS POTENTIALLY WHERE YOU HAVE SOME PRIOR RESTRAINT BUT LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THAT REGARD. BUT AT HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO SEE THE BILL FORD AFTER YOU TAKE A MOMENT TO CLOSE. AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ATTY. ON SUGGESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO FIND A WAY TO WRITE THIS BETTER. I TAKE IT THAT TRIES TO MEET THE ARE THE BEST PRACTICES IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT BUT IF WE CAN D THAT BETTER I WOULD ALSO NOTE ON THE FINE ISSUE THAT. THERE ARE FINE SAID THAT ARE ADDED ON TO EVERY FINE SO EVEN A LEVEL OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO FIND COULD BE UP TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND IN REALITY I THINK IT WAS THE OBJECTION THE GOVERNOR BROWN RAISED ORIGINALLY ON THE BILL TWO YEARS AGO -- WAS THAT THE FINE COULD I REACH OVER FOR ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO. IT WAS TRYING TO BE SENSITIVE TO DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW ABOUT THAT AMOUNT AND LISTEN A LOT OF TIMES WE WE TRY TO PUT A BASS LINE -- PROPOSAL IN PLACE IN LAW AND IT JUST FROM THAT AS WE SEE WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT I CERTAINLY HAVE A COMMITMENT TO YOU IN. MY OLLEAGUES TO DO IT JUST THIS IS A GOES FORWARD IT MAKE SURE IT CAN BE AS EFFECTIVE AS IT CAN BE AN FAIR. FAIR TO THOSE. GOOD THANK YOU -- SENATOR. WE HAVE A MOTION.

WELCOME. OKAY THANK YOU -- DO YOU WANT TO START LET'S SEE. WHAT WE GO? BUT WE GO FILE ORDER HERE SO IF YOU DON'T MIND YOU TO PRESENT SB NINETEEN FIRST TASK [inaudible] THE RIGHT. THE J. IT IS THE ALL RIGHT MISTER HAIRMAN -- IN MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WE'RE HEARING THIS MORNING I'M PRESENTING SB NINETEEN FOURTEEN PERTAINING TO STREAM GAGES. SB NINETEEN WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO DEPLOY A NETWORK OF STREAM GAUGES. INCLUDING A DETERMINATION OF FUNDING NEEDS IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR REACTIVATING EXISTING GAUGES. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE'RE IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF DROUGHT MANAGING OUR WATER SUPPLY WITH GROWING MORE CRITICAL AND DIFFICULT. JUDY GAPS IN THE STATE AND REGIONAL WATER DATA. UNDER THE FEAR YOU CAN'T MANAGE WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHY AUTHORED. AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE THE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WATER DATA ACT. PURSUANT TO THE ACT D. W. ARE THE WATER BOARD AND MANY OTHERS ARE MAKING TREMENDOUS PROGRESS ON BUILDING A FEDERATED. DATA PLATFORM THAT BRINGS TOGETHER A BROAD RANGE OF RELATED DATA SETS THAT WATER MANAGERS AKADEMI ENDS IN ADMINISTRATORS CAN USE TO MAKE SCIENCE BASED WATER POLICY DECISIONS. NOW THAT THE DATA PLATFORM IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN POPULATED WITH DATA. CONTENT -- WOULD WATER QUALITY CONTEMPORARIES -- WATER DATA. IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT CALIFORNIA HAS LOST THE ABILITY TO MEASURE STREAM FLOW A VERY IMPORTANT TYPE OF DATA. 86% OF THE STATE'S SIGNIFICANT STREAMS ARE POORLY GAUGED CALIFORNIA USED TO HAVE MORE THAN THIRTY SIX HUNDRED STREAM GAGES MOSTLY MANAGED BY THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SERVICE. DELIGHTED SERVICE FEES MAY UNFORTUNATELY THE LAST DECADE NEARLY HALF OF THOSE GAUGES HAVE BECOME INACTIVE. EVEN FEWER GAUGES PROVIDE RICH REAL TIME REPORTING WITH FLUCTUATING WEATHER CYCLES ARE RELIABLE SUPPLY OF WATER IS DIMINISHED. IN MANAGING OUR WATER RESOURCES GROWS MORE IMPORTANT RESTORING STREAM GAGES AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF STATEWIDE AND REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. SB NINETEEN IS A FIRST UP TO THAT RESTORATION BY CALLING FOR A PLAN FOR PRIORITIZATION ENGAGE LOCATIONS AND FOR RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW HOW. GAUGE DEPLOYMENT CAN BE FUNDED THERE'S NO OPPOSITION AS BEING NINETEEN AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY ARE WITNESSES FROM THE NATURE. CONSERVANCY [inaudible] WELCOME. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY I AM -- JAY ZIEGLER WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY -- WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB -- NINETEEN WHILE THEY DON'T SOUND PARTICULARLY SEXY STREAM GAUGES ARE THE BACKBONE OF WATER REAL TIME WATERED DATA INFORMATION NECESSARY. TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE RIVERS AND STREAMS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS SENATOR DODD NOTED -- RIVERS -- ARE INADEQUATELY GAUGED AROUND THE STATE. SB NINETEEN WILL CALL FOR A PLAN BETWEEN THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO PRIORITIZE GAUGE REDEPLOYMENT. TO WORK WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND OTHER PARTNERS IN INTEGRATING STREAM FLOW INFORMATION -- WITH TELEMETRY DATA AND OTHER SOURCES OF WATER INFORMATION TO GIVE US A BETTER HANDLE ON HOW TO MANAGE -- WATER IN OUR STREAMS AND WE APPLAUD SENATOR DODD'S EFFORTS -- AND BRING THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD AND ASK FOR YOUR FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION THANK YOU SIR. WELCOME GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MARK FENSTER MAKER FOR THE CINEMA COUNTY WATER AGENCY. AWESOME WATER IS ONE OF THE LUCKY IN THE STATE TO ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM SOME REAL TIME STREAM GAUGE DATA AND WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT REAL TIME ASPECT -- I SHOULD SAY THAT. WE ENJOY THIS DATA BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO PUT SOME FUNDING INTO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE GAUGES IN OUR STREAMS. I IS THAT LOCAL STATE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP WERE REALLY SEEKING THAT THIS BILL WILL RESULT IN MORE THAT THE LOCALS PROVIDE SOME OF THAT. SHOP MAINTENANCE FUNDING BUT WE NEED THE STATE TO TO PLAY ITS ROLE WORKING WITH THE FEDS TO FULLY DEVELOP A A MORE ROBUST SYSTEM. FOR US OUT IN THAT SOME WATER. WHAT WE BENEFIT FROM THROUGH THIS DATA IS IS BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF FLOWS HELPS US IN OUR AT OUR? MINIMUMS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FISH HABITAT. MY WATER SUPPLY WE USE A VERY STAYING WE RECENTLY LAUNCHED -- WEBSITE SO THE PUBLIC CAN SEE THIS DATA -- AS IT MOVES THROUGH OUR OUR SYSTEM SO WEREN'T STRONG SUPPORT THANK CENTER DOT FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. PER SHARE ABOUT. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. NAME AND AFFILIATION FINE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MICHAEL FROST.

I DID YOU KNOW -- MY CRACK STAFF DID NOT -- I COULD PUT A NOTE ON MY IT OUT YOU KNOW I'M AT THAT AGE BILL IT CAN YOU KNOW. IT'S EXCUSE ME SENATOR. BURGER MAYBE YOUR STAFF COULDN'T GET IS THE ANSWER LATER. NO IT'S NOT RIGHT. THERE'S A REASON IS THE OLD ENGLISH SPELLING OF THE FACT THAT THE RATE IS THE SECTION SPELLING OF AN EMPHATIC -- GAUGE ADVOCATE AT THE US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. GREEN APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION AND THANK YOU FOR THE HISTORICAL REMINDER -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS YES AND AROUND. WELL I WAS GONNA ASK YOU LAST YEAR ABOUT THIS. AND IT WITH THE I CAN REMEMBER THAT YEAH YEAH. IT IS TO BE WAS A BIT WAS BASICALLY A AT AN ENGINEER ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO DECIDED TO KIND OF SWITCH IT FROM THE ENGLISH SPELLING. TO GET BACK TO THE AGENTS ACCIDENTS SO -- SO HERE WE ARE. IT'S ALL VERY EXCITING. THAT'S IT THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT. WHICH IS. MAY KIDDING TIME WE CAN BE. DIG IN LET'S DIGGING DEEPER. WHAT IS A SAXON ANYWAYS YOU KNOW? I I DID HAVE ONE SERIOUS QUESTION OF FOR MISTER MAY MR ZIEGLER IS PROFESSOR MAKER IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITIES STATE TO UPGRADE THE THE OLDER GAUGES OUT THERE I SEE SOME OF THE DATA IT SAYS. ABOUT THIRTY SIX HUNDRED LOCATIONS ONLY 54% ACTIVE RECENTLY. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM TO ACTUALLY GET THAT KIND A REAL TIME DATA BACK THAT WE NEED OR IS THERE. ARE THERE TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GO IN AND RETROFIT AND MAYBE GO BACK TO SOME OF THESE. SORT OF SAU LOADER YOU KNOW MR SHATTERED LOCATIONS IN A AND REINVIGORATE THEM WITHOUT A WHOLE OVER ALL. RIGHT WHAT THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I I THINK OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT A GOOD NUMBER OF THE GAUGES THAT ARE IN ACTIVE TODAY -- YOU KNOW FOR PERHAPS A THIRD OF THE GAUGES COULD BE REACTIVATED -- WITH VERY MINIMAL EFFORT AT THE CHECK CLIMATE OF AN INDIVIDUAL GAUGE WHICH PROVIDES -- STREAM FLOW WATER QUALITY WATER TEMPERATURE INFORMATION -- EACH AN INDIVIDUAL GAUGES ABOUT -- TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND TO ABOUT HALF THAT USGS ESTIMATES FOR AN AVERAGE GAUGE TWELVE THOUSAND A YEAR AND MAINTENANCE COSTS -- WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH -- STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ABOUT IS A FORMULA IN WHICH THE THE STATE MAY USE PROP ONE OR OTHER BOND FUNDS. TO DEPLOY THE GAUGES TO DEVISE OF THAT COST AND TO HAVE A PARTNER SHARING AGREEMENT WITH HE LOCAL AGENCIES AND U. S. G. S. PICKING UP MORE OF THE MAINTENANCE COST OF THOSE GAUGES AND SO. WE THINK THERE'S A PATH FORWARD HERE -- THAT REALLY JUST REQUIRES THE AGENCIES TO GET TOGETHER IN AN INTEGRATED PLAN VERY GOOD. BUT I'D I'D APPRECIATE THE FOLLOW UP ON YOUR LEGISLATION LAST YEAR CENTER DIED IN TRYING TO SORT OF ADD. THIS DATA SAID IN IS CRITICAL FOR ACTUALLY GONNA. SAVE OUR ENVIRONMENT AND AND ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT FLOWS WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE TO ACTUALLY COME UP WITH IN THE TIDWATER PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WORK SO -- WITH THAT ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE AN RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT THANK YOU. ENTERTAIN A MOTION ANYONE'S GOT. ONE THANK YOU CENTER MONEY. THE MOTIONS TO PASS THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR STERN HI STERN I'D JONES ALAN. ALLEN AYE BRIDGES CABALLERO. CABALLERO AYE HERTZBERG HUESO. HUESO AYE JACKSON MONEY MONNING I THAT HAS FAILED -- WEIRD FIVE VOTES BUT WE WILL PUT THAT ON CALL. VERY GOOD NEXT SENATOR DIED -- SB. SIXTY TWO YES MR MEMBERS SB SIXTY TWO ADDRESSES TWO SUNSETS IN LAWS PERTAINING TO ENDANGERED SPECIES. SB SIXTY TWO ELIMINATES A SUNSET CONCERNING PROTECTIONS AGAINST ACCIDENTAL TAKE -- OF ENDANGERED SPECIES. AXLE TAKE PROVISIONS WERE ORIGINALLY ENACTED INTO LAW IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN REDUCE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO RENEWED IN THIRTEEN TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THERE HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLAINTS. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY TWO OR THREE YEARS TO KEEP EXTENDING THIS LAW. THE BILL DOES ADD HOWEVER FOR THE FIRST TIME A REQUIREMENT THAT THE FARMER WHO ACCIDENTALLY TAKES A SPECIES REPORT THE EVENT TO FISH AND WILDLIFE. THE REPORTING IS AN IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT SO WE KNOW HOW OFTEN THESE ACCIDENTAL TAKES OCCUR. THE AMENDMENT I'VE ACCEPTED WOULD REQUIRE DFW TO INFORM THE LEGISLATURE ON THE NUMBER IN NATURE OF ACCIDENTAL TAKE REPORTS. SECOND THE BILL ALSO EXTEND THE SUNSET OF THE SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENT -- PROGRAM ACT UNTIL. JANUARY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR THE CALIFORNIA SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENT PROGRAM ACTING COURAGE'S LANDOWNERS TO MANAGE THEIR LANDS TO AGREEMENT WITH DFW. IN A MANNER THAT PROTECTS THREATEN ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT ACT IS SET TO EXPIRE IN. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY DFW HAS APPROVED EIGHT SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENTS SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS ENACTED. SB SIXTY TWO WOULD EXTEND THE ACT FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS.

FOR THAT AXONAL TAKE PROVISION IN EXCHANGE FOR REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE ME TO THE PUNCH A WONDERFUL OKAY -- WELL. I JUST WANTED TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT -- THE AXONAL TAKE PROVISION IN THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS A VALUABLE PIECE. OF PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS THAT REMOVES ANY DISINCENTIVE FROM PROVIDING WILDLIFE HABITAT ON THEIR FARMS AND RANCHES BY GIVING THEM PROTECTION IF THEY ACCIDENTALLY TAKE A LISTED SPECIES IN AXONAL TAKE IS DIFFERENT THAN INCIDENTAL TAKE -- IT TRULY HAS TO BE AN ACCIDENT OR HAS TO BE UNINTENDED OR UNFORESEEN. A AND AND THOSE ARE VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES BUT WE IT'S A VERY BUT STILL IS A VALUABLE PIECE OF LAW THAT HELPS -- FARMERS AND RANCHERS CONTINUE BEING SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA AND THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONIS ALSO IMPORTANT INVALUABLE IN HELPING -- FOLKS. VIED HABITAT -- FOR AN INCREASE HABITAT FOR LISTED SPECIES AND AND WE SUPPORT EXTENDING THE SUNSET -- FOR THAT AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF ANYONE HAS A VERY. FAMOUS CARS. YOUR SINGLE BECKY WITH A CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL APOLOGIZE FOR NOT GETTING OUR LETTER IN ON TIME -- BUT OUR MEMBERS PARTICULARLY FIND THE CALIFORNIA'S -- STATE SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENT PROGRAM -- IMPORTANT FOR OUR MEMBERS UNDER THE PROGRAM OUR MEMBERS VOLUNTARILY WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND MANAGE OUR ANDS IN A WAY THAT ENHANCE THE HABITAT FOR THE POPULATION. OF LISTED SPECIES IN A RETURN THAT APART TO ALLOW FOR THE INCIDENTAL TAKE A PROTECTED SPECIES BUT ONLY IF THERE'S AN AT CONSERVATION BENEFIT FOR THE COVERED SPECIES.

HELLO GOOD MORNING JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER HAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE JACK I'M HALF OF AMERICANS DASHIELL GROWERS AFRICAN AMERICAN FARMERS CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL. CALIFORNIA DAIRIES IN CALIFORNIA RICE CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRIES% CALIFORNIA TOMATO GROWERS WESTERN PLAN HEALTH AND FAR WEST EQUIPMENT DEALERS IN SUPPORT. VERY GOOD THANK. THE CELL BE ON A BEHALF OF A CALIFORNIA GRAIN FEED THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE AND A FEW OTHER AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES AND SUPPORT FOR YOU THANKS SIR. VALERIE NARROW FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT THANKS SO MUCH. YES -- WE WILL ALLOW FOR TWEETERS NOW JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND I'M NOT SURE QUITE WHERE THE COMMITTEE MIGHT BE HEADED AND SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE TESTIMONY I'M GIVING WILL BE. AMELIORATED -- AT LEAST -- SIGNIFICANTLY BUT DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE WAS THE ORIGINAL SPONSOR OF THE SENATOR PAVLEY BILL -- THAT THIS BILLS EXTENDING -- WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE BILL VERY MUCH BECAUSE IT REPORTING REQUIREMENT FOR ANYONE WHO USES THE ACCIDENTAL TAKE PROVISION AND WOULD EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROGRAM AND WE DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE. TO TAKE THE AND OR THE AUTHOR I'M SORRY TO TAKE THIS SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT WERE OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SUNSET PROVISION OF THE-ACCIDENTAL TAKE PROVISION REINSTATED SO AT SUNSET AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THE SPONSORS INTERESTED IN THAT AS WELL AS LONG AS THAT IS PAIRED. WITH A REPORT -- INTO DFW BY FARMERS AND WE WOULD BE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AMENDMENT TO THE BILL. AND I THINK THE LAST PIECE THAT HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED THAT IS AN ADDRESSED WOOD WE THINK THAT IT'S TIME TO ELIMINATE THE SUNSET ALL TOGETHER FOR THE SAFE HARBOR PROGRAM -- BUT WE'D LIKE AS I MENTIONED WE ORIGINALLY SPONSORED THAT LEGISLATION STRONGLY BELIEVE IN THE NEED TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR LANDOWNERS TO PROACTIVELY RESTORING CONSERVE LANDS. BAD THAT EIGHT SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENTS HAVE THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED OF OCCURRED IN SIX COUNTIES AND IT PROTECT SIX IMPERILED SPECIES. THE PROGRAM IS A SUCCESS AND THE TIME IS COME TO REMOVE THE SUNSET PROVISION ENTIRELY TO PERMANENTLY ENSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE PROGRAM TO LANDOWNERS SO. WITH THAT SAID OF CHANGES TO THE BILL WE WOULD BE PLEASED TO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. FOR THAT TWEENER TESTIMONIES ANY OPPOSITION OUT RIGHT. SEE NINE MEMBER DO YOU ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] COMMENTS. BEFORE I ENTERTAIN THAT MOTION I WANTED. TO HAVE A BRIEF EXCHANGE BUT CENTER COMING UP PLEASE. NOT CLEAR TO ME WHETHER THE AMENDMENTS ARE BEING TAKEN IN AND FRANKLY I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW. THE THE SENTENCE ON AMENDMENT NUMBER ONE OPERATES. MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT IT'S NARROWING IT. TO FARMERS RANCHERS AND EMPLOYEES AS OPPOSED TO THE BROADER. CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT. IRRIGATION DISTRICTS AND OTHER YES. SO. SO I'M I'M I'M GOOD WITH THAT AND I'M I'M ASSUMING THAT -- DOCTORS GOING TO TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I THINK IT'S IT'S WELL DONE I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT WERE SUNSET. THAT THAT WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING TO ME. SO SO WHY DON'T -- WHAT I JUMP IN HERE THEN? THE SON SAID THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED IS UP WAS POSED BY THE SPONSORS ARE THE ARE THE SUPPORTERS AS POTENTIAL SUBSTITUTION FOR THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT -- TO CDF W. FOR THIS SAFE FOR WHO USES THE SAFE HARBORS AMONG THE FARMERS SO. IN OTHER WORDS THE THE THE COSTS ARE ADMINISTRATIVELY THAT WOULD BE -- UNDERTAKEN BY CITY OF W. INTAKE THE AYE AYE WE WE HAVE TO FIGHT AFTER THE AUTHOR WHAT HE'S OPEN TO BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY FINDING A WAY TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY ON THIS PROGRAM UNDERSTAND IT FUNCTIONS. THE IDEA IS THAT THE SUNSET WHICH TO SERVE A SIMILAR FUNCTION TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS I DON'T THINK IT WOULD SATISFY -- THE TWENTY YEARS BUT I DID WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE I KNOW WE'VE TALKED TO STAFF AND SOME OF YOUR SPONSORED ABOUT IT BUT ARE YOU WOULD YOU BE AMENABLE. TO SUBSTITUTING SAY THAT OF A FOUR YEAR SUNSET -- LIKE WE WOULD LIKE WE DISCUSSED HERE -- FOR THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENT. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY -- I I DO I DO RECOGNIZE THE I DEFENDERS WILDLIFE'S CONCERNED ABOUT -- HAVING SOME ONGOING. REPORTING GOING FOR TO SORT OF KNOW HOW THIS IS FUNCTIONING SO -- I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT COMPLETELY OFF THE TABLE VOTE FOR PURPOSES OF NOT. THE TRYING TO COMPLETELY AMEND THE BILL FROM THE DICE HERE TODAY I THINK THE IDEA WOULD BE TO HAVE THE AUTHOR TAKEN AUTHORS AMENDMENT -- FOR THIS FOR YOUR SON SAID REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND THEN I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU JUST TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE TWENTY YEARS OUT THERE. TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOME WAY TO FIND ACCOUNTABILITY ON THAT THAT PIECE SO DOES THAT HELP CLARIFY THINGS OKAY VERY GOOD -- ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM CENTER HUESO DID YOU WANNA CLOSE. LIKE LAST YEAR I HAVE A VERY GOOD -- THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. SENATE STERN HI FERN I'D JONES ALLEN. ALLEN I BARGES CABALLERO CABALLERO AYE HERTZBERG HUESO. HUESO AYE JACKSON MONEY. MONEY I JUST FIVE BELIEVING CHOQUET SO THAT WE HAVE FIVE VOTES THERE WE WILL LEAVE THAT ON CALL -- AND YOUR FINAL MEASURE THE DAY AS BE -- TO FOR YES MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SB TWO OH FOUR REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. D. W. R. AND THE DELTA CONVEYANCE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. TO INFORM LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES OF PENDING STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTS IN AMENDMENTS. WE ALL KNOW THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIXES A PROPOSAL TO BUILD A CONVEYANCE UNDER THE DELTA TO DIRECTLY SHIP WATER TO STATE WATER PROJECT'S. PUMPS. THE TUNNELS OF CONSTRUCTED WILL BE PART OF THIS. DEVELOPMENT OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PROJECT IS CARRIED OUT BY D. W. R. PURSUANT TO CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE D. W. R.. IN STATE WATER CONTRACTORS THE CONTRACTS COVER MATTERS SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF DELIVERABLE WATER ALLOCATION ACOSTA BUILDING IN SUPPLY ISSUES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO EACH CONTRACTOR. ADDITIONALLY THE DELTA CONVEYANCE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY. HAS BEEN CREATED A PLAN DESIGNED TO CONSTRUCT THE WATER FIX PROJECT. UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF D. W. R.. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE WATER FIX CONTRACTS. BEYOND THE FACTS THAT JUST STATED. WE READ A LOT OF NEWS ARTICLES AND TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THERE IS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF REQUIRED INFORMATION D. W. R. HAS TO SUBMIT. TO THE LEGISLATURE. THE FACT IS FUNDING FOR WATER FIX IS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED THEREFORE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THAT IS TYPICALLY. PERFORMED BY THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SIMPLY DOESN'T OCCUR. THE APPLICATIONS IN IMPACTS OF WATER FIX OUR ENORMOUS. FOR MY DELTA CONSTITUENTS WATER FIX THREATENS MASSIVE DISRUPTIONS TO THE DELTA'S REGIONAL AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY COMMUNITY CULTURE AND SAFETY AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. TO NUMEROUS TO QUOTE. FOR THE REST OF THE STATE WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HALF THE WATER RATE INCREASES AND POTENTIAL INCREASES THE PROPERTY TAXES NECESSARY TO FUND THIS PROJECT. SB TWO OH FOUR SIMPLY PUT IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY INSURING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS MADE FULLY AWARE OF PENDING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS D. W. R. IN THE GPA WHICH TO ENTER INTO. BEFORE THEY HAPPEN WITH OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND INPUT THROUGH HEARINGS OR WRITTEN COMMENTARY. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SUGGEST AMENDMENTS TO TIGHTEN UP THE PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN SUBMISSION OF REQUIRED INFORMATION AND REVIEW BY THE JAIL BC AND RELEVANT COMMITTEES AS WELL AS THAT OF FLOOR. FOR THE MINIMUM OUT OF COD CONTRACTS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. ASSURED THAT THE BILL STILL ACCOMPLISHES MY THE IN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT -- THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE -- HERE TO TESTIFY IN THE BILL IS SACRAMENTO COUNTY SUPERVISOR DON TO TOTALLY IN FOR ME STORE THE DELTA BARBARA BERRIGAN PARTY -- GOOD -- GOOD MORNING -- GERMAN STERN IN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TO JOIN SENATOR DODD. TO AND OTHERS -- IN SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU AS IS THE BEEN -- AMENDED. I WANT TO KNOW DE DE DA COUNTIES COLLECTION REPRESENTS THE FIVE COUNTIES OF CONTRA COSTA SACRAMENTO YOU LOS LLANOS AND WE CAN COUNTY. AND THAT -- TOGETHER WE WORK -- TO IN CONCERT -- OVER THE COURSE OF MANY AND ON PROJECTS THAT -- WILL IN A POTENTIALLY HAVE IMPACT IN THIS CASE HAVE IMPACT ON THE DELTA IN THIS COMMUNITIES. WE UNDERSTAND THE NEW ADMINISTRATION -- PLANS ON REVISIONS -- TO THE OF THE PREVIOUS HE PROPOSED WATER FIX PROJECT. AND THAT -- WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT DON'T BECAUSE COLLISION THAT -- IS NECESSARY FOR THE THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT -- WITH THIS NEW DIRECTION -- BEING SUGGESTED. WE ALSO AGREED IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED THIS OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE REVISED PROJECT. RELATED CONTRACTS AS A CENTER DODD TO SO AB POINTED OUT. BECAUSE IT'S WATER PROJECT AS IT CONTINUES APPROPRIATION IS MENTIONED THAT PART OF WATER RESOURCES -- IMPROPER PARTICIPANTS HAVE NOT HAD TO COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE TO UPDATE COMMITTEES ON ACTIVITIES WERE JUSTIFIED THE EXPENDITURE OF THE PLAN ON THE PLANS. THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO DELTA COUNTIES IN TO THE FOLKS THAT WE REPRESENT. BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE PAST TEN YEARS. IMAGE OF CONTINUE TO PRESS FORWARD ON A A PLAN THAT WE BELIEVE WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON DELTA COUNTIES AND COMMUNITIES PEOPLE REPRESENT. AND SO THEREFORE WE TO DILIGENTLY JOURNEYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK IS BEING DONE IS APPROPRIATE. REASONABLE CONSISTENT WITH A CO EQUAL GOALS OF COURSE PROTECTS AND PRESERVES THE UNIQUE VALUES OF THE DELTA. THE DELTA REGION IS CERTAIN TO EXPERIENCE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE THE LOSS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS. WITH THIS MASSIVE PROJECT. AS WELL AS STATED BY SENATOR DODD DELTA RESIDENTS WILL BE TREMENDOUSLY IMPACTED THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD AND FOR THE EVER AFTER. THE DELTA COUNTIES ALSO LEGISLATURE TO OVERSEE THE WATER FIX PROJECT IN INDIA WRITTEN INTO YOUR AERATION NEW OR OTHERWISE. ENSURE THE PUBLIC KNOWS HELD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE SPENT PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE SPENT. AND CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES OF THE ONGOING IMPACTS OF THIS PROJECT. THE DCC WANT TO THANK SENATOR DODD MEMBERS OF OUR DOT COUNTY DELEGATION FOR AUTHORING HIS BILL AND WE BELIEVE THAT SB TOOL FOR AS AMENDED WILL BRING. GREATER TRANSPARENCY TO THE PROCESS FOR AYE VOTE ON THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. OF THOSE AND OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR STERN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M BARBARA BERRA GAME PRE ON ON THE SECOND OF DIRECTOR FOR RESTORE THE DELTA. ON BEHALF OF OUR ORGANIZATION AND OUR SIXTY THOUSAND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS OUR FULL SUPPORT FOR SB TWO OH FOUR AND THE AMENDMENTS. YOU HAVE IN YOUR FILE OF A COALITION LETTER. THAT WE SENT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL SIGNED BY OVER FORTY GROUPS RANGING FROM BUSINESS CHAMBERS TWO TRIBES TO FISHING GROUPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS. TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY REPRESENT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IN ADDITION YOU HAVE AN A A LETTER THAT HAS OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED SIGNATURES OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUALS ALSO IN IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. DESPITE WATER FIX PROPONENTS HAVING SPENT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PLANNING OVER TWELVE YEARS. pTHE WATER AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS A DETAILED PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT FINANCIAL PLAN DOCUMENTING WHO WILL PAY. AND A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT EVALUATES THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF FRESH WATER TO THE BAY DELTA. AND COASTAL ECONOMIES. A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACT EXTENSION FOR WATER FIX. AND CONTRACTS MADE BY THE TWO WATER FIXED JOINT POWER AUTHORITIES. CAN HELP SHED LIGHT ON SOME OF THESE. WATER FIXES DESCRIBED BY D. W. ARE AT THE STATE WATER BOARD PERMIT HEARINGS INDICATES THAT WATER WILL BE EXPORTED THROUGH A TUNNEL DURING WET PERIODS. USING ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT TOOLS IN A VARIABLE RANGE THAT WILL BE DETERMINED BY WATER EXPORTERS INDEED W. ARE AT A LATER DATE. HOWEVER WATER DELIVERY MODELS CREATED BY METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SHOW THAT MORE WATER WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE DELTA DURING DRY PERIODS THAN AT PRESENT. WHEN DELTA COMMUNITIES DURING THOSE DRY PERIODS NEED FLOWS TO FLUSH OUT SALINITY TOXINS IN ALGAL BLOOMS FROM THE ESTUARY? TO UNDERSTAND IN GREATER DETAIL WHAT THE IMPACT WILL BE ON OUR WATER QUALITY DELTA PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS NEED TO BE ABLE TO LEARN OF AND EVALUATE THE WATER FIX CONTRACT EXTENSION. BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE REAL DECISIONS REGARDING WATER EXPORTS WILL BE SPELLED OUT. AND PARTICIPATING IN OBSERVING THE STATE WATER CONTRACT PROCESS. DOESN'T NECESSARILY ANSWER ALL THOSE QUESTIONS. FOR INSTANCE WHEN WE ONE UNDERSTAND CONTRACTUAL DECISIONS IN NEGOTIATIONS AS WITH THE COORDINATED OPERATING AGREEMENT BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL WATER CONTRACTORS. AROUND WATER DELIVERIES WERE FORCED TO SUBMIT PUBLIC RECORD ACT REQUESTS. IT TAKES D. W. R. N. M. W. D. BETWEEN THREE AND SIX MONTHS TO REPLY TO OUR REQUESTS AND THE INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVE IS SO HEAVILY REDACTED WE CAN NEVER FULLY GAIN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE STATE WATER CONTRACT EXTENSION FOR WATER FIX IT HAS TO BE ANALYZED IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PROCESSES. SB TWENTY FOUR WILL HELP US MAKE THOSE COMPARISONS. ADDITIONALLY WATER FIX HAS JUST -- WATER FIX AS IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED IN TESTIMONY BEFORE THE STATE WATER BOARD DOES NOT MATCH IN DETAIL WITH WATER DELIVERY PROMISES MADE BY THE MANAGEMENT. OF METROPOLITAN TO CUSTOMER THE BOUNDARIES OF ITS MEMBER AGENCIES. MY STAFF AND I HAVE ATTENDED DOZENS OF MEETINGS THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE PROMISES WERE MADE TO WATER. OUR CUSTOMERS WATER RATE PAYERS THE THIRD DISTRICT OR MUNICIPALITY WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR WATER THEY DID NOT RECEIVE. YET ANNUAL BOND REPAYMENTS WILL REMAIN CONSTANT. AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF DEBT CARRIED BY MATT WILL REQUIRE MAJORITY IF NOT 100% MEMBER AGENCY PARTICIPATION FOR THAT REPAYMENT. WELL THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN PROMISED BY TOTAL PROPONENTS THAT THOSE RECEIVING THE WATER WOULD PAY FOR THE PROJECT. WE KNOW THAT IN ADDITION TO VOLUMETRIC SALES OF WATER MATT WILL SPREAD DEBT REPAYMENT FOR WATER FIX ACROSS WATER TRANSPORTATION CHARGES AND VERY LIKELY THROUGH PARCEL TAXES. IN OTHER WORDS CUSTOMERS WHO WILL NOT RECEIVE WATER FROM THE PROJECT WILL HELP TO REPAY ITS BOND DEBT. FOR TWO TO FOUR GENERATIONS. THIS IS WHY THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS THE TIME SB TWO OH FOUR PROVIDES FOR EVALUATION OF THE WATER FIX CONTRACT EXTENSION. THIS IS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE CAN ASK HOW BOND REPAYMENTS WHICH WILL REMAIN CONSTANT EVERY YEAR. EVEN DURING YEARS OF EXTENDED DROUGHT ONE LITTLE WATER WILL BE DELIVERED WILL BE REPAID FOR WATER FIX GPA MEMBERS. DESPITE GOVERNOR NEWSOME HITTING THE RESET BUTTON FOR WATER FIX THE DESIGN CONSTRUCTION FINANCE AUTHORITY. HAS CONTINUED MOVING AHEAD WITH HIRING CONTRACTORS WHILE THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION GPA HAS HIRED A FIRM FROM GERMANY TO BEGIN FULL DESIGN OF THE PROJECT. WHERE IS THE MONEY COMING FROM TO FINANCE THESE ACTIVITIES? HOW MUCH OF THE GPAS ACTIVITIES ARE BEING FINANCED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES? THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW THE ANSWER. THE EXECUTION OF SB TOOL FOR WOULD SET IN PLACE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. D. W. OURS PROPOSED CONTRACT AMENDMENTS IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE DSC AND THE CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITIES WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL PASS SB TWO OH FOUR WITH ITS AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT I KNOW YOU IT SLIGHTLY TWEAKED RAGWORT AND SEEKING AMENDMENTS COULD YOU TELL ME JUST READ RUN THROUGH SUPPORT REAL QUICK AND THEN WE'LL.

ON THE WATER FIX HOWEVER WAS CONTINGENT UPON -- YOU KNOW THE FAIRNESS OF ALLOCATION OF IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS OF SB TWO OH FOUR SO OUR OUR AMENDMENT WOULD SEEK TO TAKE A JUST A BIT FURTHER IN EXTENDING -- THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. A RELATED -- TO PROVIDED ESTIMATED COST FOR THE WATER CONTRACTORS TO EXTEND THAT INFORMATION -- TO ALSO WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS AND CITY AGO IS A IS A IS A WATER WHOLESALER SO THAT WE WOULD BE PRIVY TO THAT INFORMATION AS WELL.

IT WOULD JUST YEAH DUDE DO YOU GUYS CAN SCREW CHIN MAKE ROOM AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL SWAP BACK OUT IF NEED BE THANK YOU MA'AM. WELCOME GOOD MORNING. MORE. GOOD MORNING -- GERMAN CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JENNIFER PIERRE AND I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER FOR THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING TO TESTIFY. THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS IS A NOT FOR FROM NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION AND WE REPRESENT TWENTY SEVEN OF THE TWENTY NINE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THAT CONTRACT. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES FOR STATE WATER PROJECT. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE STAFF ANALYSIS AND THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT CAME OUT LIKE LATE LAST WEEK -- IF ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR -- THE OUTLINE A PATH FORWARD FOR AMENDMENTS AND ADDRESS A NUMBER OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE ORIGINALLY HAD. SO BASED ON THOSE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS I'M JUST GOING TO LIMIT MY COMMENTS SO WHERE WE HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS. SO AS BEFORE -- TO FOR TOUCHES ON TWO COMPONENTS RELATED TO TRANSPARENCY. THE FIRST IS ON CERTAIN AMENDMENTS A LONG TERM WATER SUPPLY CONTRACTS THAT GOVERN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES. THESE ARE LONG TERM CONTRACTS THEY DEAL ISSUES LIKE COST ALLOCATION AND WATER ALLOCATION AND NOT THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT OR ITS MAINTENANCE. THE SECOND COMPONENT AND WHICH IS THE FOCUS OF MY REMARKS AS THE FOCUS ON THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR -- TRIGGER FOR THE DELTA CONVEYANCE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. OR AS WE CALL IT THE DELTA CONVEYANCE AUTHORITY. THE CONTRACTS AT THE DELTA CONVEYANCE UTHORITY WOUD ENTER INTO OUR FOR THE PLANNING AND DESIGN OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX THEY WOULD NOT. BE RELATED TO ANY OF THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT THEY ARE REALLY RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OPERATION SCHEDULE. THE AUTHORITY WITH AN AGREEMENT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES HAS -- HAS THE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THE REMAINING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION ALL OF THE COSTS THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION ARE BORNE BY THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM IT. THE AGENCY THAT HAS BEEN FORMED THE DCA IS A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY BIG. GIVE ME MADE UP OF OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES AND THEY CONDUCT ALL THEIR MEETINGS AND PUBLIC WITH A COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND ALL THEIR AGENDAS STAFF PRESENTATIONS MATERIALS ETCETERA ARE POSTED ON THE WEBSITE. THE DELAY THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT -- BILL WOULD CAUSE AN INCREASE IN THE PROJECT BY REQUIRING. A CONTRACT -- IMPLEMENTATION TO BE DELAYED. WATER FIX WOULD BE FUNDED LIKE I SAID BY THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES. AND THE COSTS THAT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY INCREASE THROUGH THESE DELAYS WOULD BE BORNE BY THE RATE PAYERS AND THERE'S TWENTY SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT DO RECEIVE STATE WATER PROJECT WATER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS DRAFTED SB TWO OH FOUR WOULD IMPOSE ON THE AUTHORITY WHEN ISSUE IN CONTRACTS THAT THIS ADDITIONAL TWO MONTH DELAY IN A VERY PUBLIC A LONG PROCESS. THE IDC A GIVEN ITS PUBLIC NATURE IS SUBJECT TO PUBLIC BIDDING REQUIREMENTS AND THAT USUALLY TAKES ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS ALREADY. SO THEN ADDING AN ADDITIONAL TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE AUTHORITY COULD EXECUTE A CONTRACT. OF IS UNDUE DELAY. THIS WOULD INHIBIT THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE AUTHORITY ITSELF. ADDITIONALLY. THERE IS A REFERENCE TO AQUOTE UNQUOTE CONVENIENCE PROJECT AND WE THINK THAT COULD BE VAGUE AND LEAD TO CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT IS COVERED BY THIS BILL. WE UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE IS TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA WATER FIX OR SUSPECT X. EXCESS THEIR PROJECT. AND FOR THAT REASON WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G. TO&lt;/c&gt; APPLY TO CONVEYANCE PROJECT THAT WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN PLANET AVERSION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WATER RIGHTS. AND THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE SPECIFICITY AND COVER WATER FIX OR ANY OF ITS ASSESSED SUCCESSOR PROJECTS. AND WHEN TO MORE POINT PLEASE I'M UNDERSTANDING CENTERED ON DESIRE FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY WE URGE FURTHER AMENDMENTS FOR THE SECTION COVERING THE DC I AM THAT WOULD PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THE PERSPECTIVE BASIS AND WOULD NOT IMPACT THE CONTRACTING PROCESS OR BECAUSE UNNECESSARY DELAYS. WITH THE DEATH OF THE LÏNG WOULD BE AMENDED TO DELETE THE CONTRACT REQUIREMENT AROUND THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CAT -- TRIGGER AND INSTEAD PROVIDE. THE ANNUAL BUDGET IN DRAFT FORM AND FINAL FORM. THE THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND THE DCA THAT A LOT -- PROVIDE THAT WE INCLUDE THIS BUDGET AND THAT THE BUDGET INCLUDES INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT ESTIMATES. WITH A CONTINGENCY AMOUNTS OF THE DRAFT AND FINAL VERSION OF THAT WOULD COULD BE PROVIDED. AND THIS IS BASICALLY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE THINK IS BEING SOUGHT IN SB TWO OH FOUR BUT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION EARLIER. AND NOT DELAY THE CONTRACTING PROCESS LASTED JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE AMENDMENTS -- PRESENTED BY THE SAN DIEGO WATER AUTHORITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS NOT POSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN AT MANNING ON BEHALF OF THE MOJAVE WATER AGENCY IT'S PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY IN FRONT OF YOU ON YOUR FIRST -- DAYS CHAIR THANK YOU -- I HAVE SAT IN THIS CHAIR DOZENS OF TIMES SINCE. TWO THOUSAND NINE WHEN CENTER COVER EURO WHOSE AND IN THE ASSEMBLY AND OTHER MEMBERS -- HELPED -- DRAFT AND REWRITE CALIFORNIA WATER LAW CALL THE DELTA REFORM AT WHICH IS STYLISH THE CO EQUAL GOALS AND CREATED A WHOLE NEW PROCESS FOR REVIEWING THE WATER FIX AND IMPLEMENTING IT. ODD SINCE THAT TIME I COULD DO MISTER TO TOLLWAYS PART AND HE COULD DO MINE. BECAUSE MISTER NATOLI WITH -- WHO I RESPECT VERY MUCH -- AND THE THE RESTORE THE DELTA VOTES AND THE DELTA COUNTIES COALITION HAVE. SUPPORTED AND SPONSORED. WELL OVER THIRTY BILLS I LOST COUNT. TO STOP. DELAY OR MAKE MORE COSTLY THE WATER FIX -- AND THAT IS THEIR RIGHT. BUT WE SHOULD SEE THIS BILL AS AND MR TOLD ME MADE VERY CLEAR. THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THE WATER FIX THIS IS NOT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. THIS IS ABOUT ANOTHER EFFORT TO DELAY AND MAKE MORE COSTLY AND FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE I UNDERSTAND THAT -- BUT WE SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT FIRST. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE MONEY FOR THE WATER FIX [inaudible] THE DVR -- NOTE STATE MONEY IS SPENT ON THE WATER FIXES MAR FACT IF YOU GO BACK AND READ THE TWO THOUSAND NINE LEGISLATION. YOU PRO HIM IT IS. A PENNY. OF STATE MONEY TO BE SPENT ON THE WATER FIX AND YOU HAVE ALSO DONE A JAILER COLLIDED. SPONSORED BY THE SAME FOLKS HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT A PENNY WAS SPENT. AND IT ISN'T IT'S ALL RIGHT PAYER MONEY IT OVERSEE THIS BECAUSE IT'S LOCAL RATEPAYERS LOCAL BOARDS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS JUST LIKE MR NATOLI. FIT ON THE MOJAVE WATER AGENCY THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT AND ALL THE AGENCIES THAT ARE MAKING A CONSCIOUS CHOICE. TO FUND THIS PROJECT BECAUSE IT BENEFITS THE RATE PAYERS. WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A REVIEW PROCESS THROUGH THE STATE WATER BOARD. THEIR PUBLIC HEARINGS WHICH WERE REFERRED [inaudible] TO TRANSPARENCY. WE HAVE TO GET FISH AND WILDLIFE PERMITS ESA PERMITS TRANSPARENCY. WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH SEEK WHAT ANY BY. TRANSPARENCY. AND YOU CREATED IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINE LONG. THE BILL TO REFORM ACT THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL THE NEW AGENCY SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED TO REVIEW. THE WATER FIX FOR CONSISTENCY WITH THE DELTA PLAN WOULD YOU TOLD THEM THEY HAD TO DO. TRANSPARENCY. SO RATHER THAN A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY WERE TEN YEARS AFTER TWO THOUSAND NINE AND WE STILL HAVEN'T PUT A SHOVEL IN THE GROUND. I WOULD SAY. PERHAPS WE HAVE TOO MUCH TRANSPARENCY. PERHAPS WE NEED TO BUILD SOMETHING AT SOME POINT. HAVING SAID THAT OF COURSE WERE OPEN TO TRANSPARENCY IF THAT ISN'T ENOUGH. BUT JUST A FEW STATISTICS. THERE HAVE BEEN TEN THOUSAND FACTSHEETS EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS IT CETERA DISTRIBUTED OR COMMENTS RECEIVE THEIR BEEN THREE HUNDRED FORTY ONE DAYS OF PUBLIC HEARINGS. THERE ARE HOWEVER THE BEEN SIX HUNDRED FIFTY WORKGROUP MEETINGS. AT CETERA ET CETERA ET CETERA ON THIS PROJECT SO -- I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY. THAT YOU KNOW IMPOSING FURTHER DELAY AND FOR THE COSTS ON THE PROJECT IS NOT APPROPRIATE IF THERE'S A LEGITIMATE OVERSIGHT NEED. THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE BY THE WAY [inaudible] I'D SAY. AT LEAST ONE HEARING YEAR WITH MISTER O'CONNOR AS CONSULTANT. AT LEAST ONCE EVERY YEAR SINCE. TWO THOUSAND NINE AND WE WELCOME THAT WE'VE BEEN HERE WE'VE ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS. A GOVERNOR NEWSOME NOW HAS SPOKEN TO THE PROJECT -- SO YOU KNOW WE'RE OPEN BUT AT SOME POINT WE THINK ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND FOR THAT REASON WE OPPOSE AND WE ALSO OPPOSE THE SAN DIEGO MINUTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- OTHERS OPPOSED. THIS FEATURE MEMBERS BOARD BROOM REPRESENTING THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT -- WHICH DELIVERS STATE WATER PROJECT WATER TO TWO MILLION BAY AREA RESIDENTS AND THOUSANDS OF SILICON VALLEY JOB CREATING BUSINESSES.

UNFORTUNATELY AROUND IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WHEN IT WAS ALL SET UP AND I JUST I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THIS AND APPRECIATE THE WHAT SENATOR DODD IS TRYING TO DO HERE BUT QUITE FRANKLY -- I'M CONCERNED WITH THE DELAY AND THE CRADDICK. REVIEW AND REVIEW AND REVIEW AND I'VE I'VE SEEN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. BLOCK THEM OUT AND IT APPEARS AS IF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE GETTING RID OF THE DELAY PART OF IT -- AND IF THAT'S TRUE THEN THAT MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE WITH IT BUT I GIVEN THAT IT. EVERYTHING IS PART OF A PUBLIC PROCESS I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS MISSING WHERE WHERE DO. AND I'M. I UNDER STAFF TO READING THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT ON HIGH SPEED RAIL I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERN WITH CAN AUTOMATIC PILOT YOUDON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOU THERE'S THERE'S NOT THAT REVIEW BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WE ALWAYS HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRING THE MEN AND TO ASK. QUESTIONS I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF. WHY WE NEED THIS AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME GIVEN? IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE AMENDMENTS IF YOU TAKE THEM IS THAT. IT IS IT TAKES OUT THE NINETY DAY. DELAY. AND IT ALSO -- IT ALSO. IT YEAH IT'S A NINETY DAY DELAY AND THAT ON SITE AND THE AND TAKING IT OUT OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AS WELL. I'M GONNA LET MY WITNESS -- RESPONDED THIS BUT BEFORE HE DOES THE I TAKE EXCEPTION TO MR MANNING'S. YOUR ASSERTION THAT I AM NOT FOR TRANSPARENCY AND THAT -- WHAT I WANT TO DO IS MAKE THIS PROJECT MORE COSTLY OR STOP THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH OTHER MAYBE ADVOCATES? THAT THAT IS WHY THEY'RE SUPPORTING THIS BUT THE REASON I BIT BRING THIS BILL FORDIS BECAUSE THE OTHER MEMBES THAT ARE IN THE DELTA AREA WE FOUND IT JUST NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER. QUESTIONS FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS DURING THIS WHOLE WATER FIX PROCESS. AND FRANKLY -- YOU KNOW IF IT WEREN'T -- FOR THE JBL SEE AND THEIR ACTIONS AT THE END THE SESSION LAST YEAR -- THIS THING MIGHT HAVE GONE -- FOR THE FURTHER AND THEN IT DID AND FRANKLY A LOT OF THE OBJECTIONS FROM -- THE ADVOCATES JUST WEREN'T ADDRESS -- WE JUST FELT LIKE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THAT'S WHY I TOOK THE AMENDMENTS. I DON'T WANT ANY STATE PROJECTS TO BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE FOR OUR RATE PAYERS. VIEWS LET'S FACES LEGISLATORS. OUR CONSTITUENTS OUR RATE PAYERS AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO HAVE THEIR COSTS GO UP OR HAVE YOU KNOW TAKE THE PROJECT -- OUT YOU KNOW OUT LONGER. BUT I WOULD JUST ECHO AS EARLY AS THE CENTER DAHLE COMMENTS IN IN SAY THAT. BECOME AS RELATIVE TO A PUBLIC -- PROCESS THOSE ARE ALL ACCURATE AND NOT WITH ANY DISPUTE ABOUT THAT BUT THINK THE ARGUE ABOUT GREATER TRANSPARENCY ANSWER THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU SURELY HAVE SEEN YOU HERE BEFORE -- YOU KNOW JUST LEGISLATIVE BODIES -- IN IN IN THE PAST AND AS MUCH AS WE MAY NOT LIKE THE PROJECT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A PROCESS IN THIS ONE WE'RE OBVIOUSLY THIS LEGISLATURE AND DID THIS COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY. MINISTRATION INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA THE AUTHORITIES -- VESTED IN THEM TO MOVE FORWARD WITH PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS BUT THERE. YEAH AT STAKE IS CERTAINLY IS OUR IMPACTS TO A MET MEAL FOLKS A WITH THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT. TO ARGUE THAT TRANSPARENCY IF IT'S NOT GOING TO RESULT IN UNDUE DELAY AND OR UNDUE COST OR WRITTEN TO ME SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT COUNTER TO TO GOOD GVERNMENT IN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THAT COMMON SENSE OF THIS BILL. I THINK IT REDUCES TO SOMETHING THAT IS MASSIVE IT WILL BE A GENERATIONAL IT WILL BE -- SOMETHING THAT WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND SO THEREFORE CERTAINLY ALL OF US HAVE A STAKE IN THIS CALIFORNIA'S BUT WE'RE ASKING -- THINK WITH THIS BILL IS RUNNING SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT TRANSPARENCY IF YOU KNOW IF IT ALLOWS FOR FOLKS HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING WITH AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH THAT WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. THE ISSUE IS FOR ME IS I'M ALWAYS FOR TRANSPARENCY AND I GET IT IT'S IT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THE CONCERN I HAVE. IS -- IS A REPORT. FOR REPORTS SAKE WHERE -- PORCH WE'RE JUST SETTING UP MORE AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO BE -- WHERE THERE'S THERE THERE'S A COST EVERY TIME YOU DO -- ONE OF THESE THINGS AND SO I'M NOT SAYING I'M NOT FOR TRANSPARENCY I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU'VE GOT ALL OF THESE IF YOU'RE DOING A SEQUEL YOU'RE DOING ANY BY YOUR YOU'VE GOT. A JPA THAT'S GOT -- PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITIES FOR REPORTING AND FOR SHARING INFORMATION AND HAVING PUBLIC HEARINGS WHETHER IT WHETHER WE'RE ADDING ONE MORE LEVEL -- THAT THAT DOESN'T GET US TO WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO GO AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO GET INFORMATION. THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT IT BECAUSE FRANKLY -- THE JPA DOES DOESN'T INCLUDE THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS RIGHT AND SO THE INFORMATION THERE THEY MAY NOT BE GETTING THE INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE ON THE GROUND ARE GETTING SO I'M JUST. WE HAVE ALREADY IN THE STATE THAT PUSHED MULTIPLE. ROCKER SEES IF YOU WILL THEY DON'T HAVE ANY LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AT ALL THIS IS I THINK IT'S JUST A STRAIGHT FORWARD. RESPONSE -- TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT HAVE CREATED A MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE AREAS THAT -- WE REPRESENT AND THEN BEYOND -- THAT FOR REPAIRS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FRANKLY THE JBL SEE -- YOUR LAST YEAR AND WHAT THEY DID -- DEAL WITH THIS. IF YOU KNOW THAT PROCESS WORKED AND SO WE SAW THIS AS A GOOD COMMONSENSE A SITUATION FOR YET ANOTHER LEVEL OF REVIEW -- BY IT THE AREA AND IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE VETO POWER IT'S JUST GIVING THE LEGISLATURE SOME. SORT OF REVIEW. IN SHORT SO SORRY SO YOU GOOD. I THINK WE HAD SENATOR HUESO NAY AND WE'VE CENTER HUESO NEXT HERTZBERG NEXT NOW AYE AYE. COME TO YOU FIRST SIR COME BACK TO HERTZ BERG IN THE MID DECK MISTER BORDERS. SENATOR JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOME COMMENTS YOU MADE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT OF REFERENCE PEOPLE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE THEY OPPOSE THE PROJECT AND THAT THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY YOUR AIMED. MY QUESTION USED TO USE SUPPORT THE PROJECT. NO I DO NOT SO IF YOU HAD YOUR WAY YOU WOULD NOT -- WEIGHTS COOK OR TO SPUR THIS PROJECT WOULD NOT MOVE FORWARD I I'M STUDYING THE NEW PROPOSAL THAT -- GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S PUT ON THE TABLE I THINK IT REFLECTS A MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE -- WAY OF LOOKING THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND WILL ANXIOUSLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS GOVERNOR. ON A FIX BECAUSE YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE CAN'T JUST BE OPPOSED TO EVERYTHING THAT COMES ACROSS WE HAVE ISSUES WITH AGRICULTURE WE HAVE ISSUES WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. POPULATED AREAS AND WE'RE ALL ONE STATE AND WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIND THE RIGHT SOLUTION AND SO GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S PROPOSAL OF ONE PIPE VERSUS. TO WOULD BEGIN HOLDEN PROCESS. SO WHATEVER WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH [inaudible] OF BUT I I CAN SEE COULD BE SOMEWHAT HELPFUL BUT WE WERE BASICALLY GOING TO START A NEW PROCESS ON THIS PROBLEM. WELL I I THINK THAT'S THE GOVERNOR'S BRAGA OF IS THE DULY ELECTED GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE. ANY SAY IN THAT MATTER AS A AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. WELL WE HAVE A SAFE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. AND WE CAN PROPOSE FIXES ON OUR END. AND I'M JUST YOU KNOW SITTING HERE -- PRIVY TO THIS PROBLEM AND I I UNDERSTAND IS A MASSIVE PROBLEM NOT A BIG PROBLEM ITS MASSIVE. AND AS WE TALK ABOUT -- THIS SOLUTION PROTECT POTENTIALLY HINDERING CERTAIN FARMLANDS I ALSO KNOW ONE NON SOLUTION COULD HINDER. LOTS MORE LAND BECAUSE OF SALT WATER INTRUSION. AND THAT. AND AND THE LIKE OF OF BECAUSE BY -- IT YOU KNOW INTRODUCING. SALTWATER INVADE A SPECIES UP OF FURTHER INTO INTO THE RIVER WHICH IS ALREADY HAPPENING YOU ALREADY SEEN. A REDUCTION AND SALMON RUNS YOU ALREADY SEEN A REDUCTION IN CERTAIN ENDEMIC SPECIES HERE BECAUSE OF THE THE INTRODUCTION OF OF OF OF MORE MARINES SPEECHES WERE NEVER. YOU KNOW I'M. I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT US KIND OF CHANGING DIRECTION AFTER TEN YEARS I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM NOT THE TEXT -- BUT I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT -- I TAKE IT COULD TAKE TWO TO THREE MONTHS TO GET INFORMATION FROM THIS AGENCY. MY QUESTION REGARDING THAT ISN'T THERE -- ALL OF A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT AND HOW. A GOVERNMENT AGENCIES NEED TO RESPOND -- TO PUBLIC RECORD REQUESTS ISN'T THAT LIKE A THIRTY DAY -- RULE THEY HAVE TO RESPOND WITHIN THIRTY DAYS [inaudible] THE PROJECT. WHEN WE GO THROUGH THESE PROCESSES WHAT HAPPENS AS WE RECEIVE LETTER AFTER LETTER FOR CONTINUATION? OP PARTICULARLY WHEN -- DECISIONS ARE BEING PROCESSED -- REGARDING -- CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS OVER WATER AVAILABILITY AND SUPPLY. AND SO WHICH OR IS THERE NOT A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THERE IS THERE IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT HOWEVER. THEY CAN RESPOND BACK AND OR THE INFORMATION THAT'S REQUESTED OR IT HAS TO GO THROUGH REVIEW FOR THEIR ATTORNEYS THAT THEY CAN pDELAY. OUR LAST PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST COULD DIED. A INCLUDED SOMETHING LIKE SIX OR SEVEN DELAYS -- WITH THIS MODEL CHANGES AFFECT. PART PART OF WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO THIS BILL CHANGE THAT THAT BILL THIS BILL WILL NOT CHANGE THAT BUT IT DOES SOMETHING ELSE FOR US. IN THAT IS. THE PROCESSES ARE ALL MATCHING UP. WHAT IS REVEALED AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ABOUT COSTS DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH WHAT YOU SEE IN CONTRACTS? DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH WATER SUPPLY DECISIONS BEING DISCUSSED BY WATER DISTRICTS. AND WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW IS SOME OVERSIGHT TIME. AT SOME TRANSPARENCY SO THAT PEOPLE CAN EVALUATE TO SEE HOW THE PIECES ARE FITTING TOGETHER. BUT IF THIS BILL DOESN'T RESOLVE YOUR PROBLEM WHY DO YOU BRING THAT UP AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE CONTRARY TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY IN PEGA SAYS THAT RESTORE THE DELTA. WE ARE VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENTIRE PROJECT. SERVING PEOPLE WITH AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE WATER AS MUCH AS WE ARE ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN. WITH IN THE DELTA THIS ISN'T AN EITHER OR SITUATION. WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. ADD TO GET IT RIGHT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. WATER SUPPLY WATER DELIVERY AND COSTS AND RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO WAY TO EVALUATE ALL THOSE PIECES TOGETHER. WELL THERE'S A WAY IF WE TAKE THE INITIATIVE TO EVALUATE ALL THOSE PIECES TOGETHER. DOES THIS BILL. REQUIRE THAT THEY'LL BE EVALUATED TOGETHER. IT HELPS THE PROCESS IT'S NOT ITDOESN'T REQUIRED EITHER SO IT DOESN'T ISN'T NECESSARILY GONNA. CONTRIBUTOR THAT EITHER. RIGHT IT HELPS THE PROCESS OKAY. BUT I I THINK GENERALLY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE IF WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A SOLUTION WE BETTER START WORKING ON IT. ANNA AND I WOULD RATHER SEE. SOME EFFORT PUT INTO. RESOLVING THIS PROBLEM. THIS IS WHERE ALL OUR EFFORTS I MEAN THIS IS. YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WHEN GOVERNMENT IS CRITICIZED. FOR FOR THIS. OF OF YOU KNOW. A HOT POTATO AROUND. AND KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND WHATEVER -- IN ANALOGY WANNA USE FOR THAT. I MEAN THIS IS KIND OF AN EXAMPLE THAT I HATE TO BE PART OF THAT PROCESS I REALLY DO THIS IS A MAJOR. PROBLEM FACING THIS IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER. IT BASE IN OUR STATE AND THIS IS THIS AFFECTS OUR ECONOMY AFFECTS OUR OUR ENVIRONMENT AFFECTS PEOPLE'S HEALTH. THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND AND AND AND IF THIS IS OUR RESPONSE TO IT I MEAN I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. SORRY SORRY SENATOR DODD BUT I MEAN CENTER CENTER WITH ALL THE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT -- TO FOR THE OPPOSITION -- TO ASSERT THAT -- A SIXTY DAY PROTECT -- IT GOING BACK AND LOOKING. LOOKING BACK AT THIS THING CREATED A TEN YEAR PROCESS -- IS FRANKLY ABSURD -- THE THE REALITY IS IT'S A TEN YEAR PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE IT DOESN'T DELIVER THE WATER THAT IS SUGGESTED DOES IN IT'S AN INCREDIBLE RISK TO AN ALREADY FRAGILE DELTA. REGION. AND SO THE REALITY IS MOVING FORWARD AGAIN FOR RATEPAYERS AND ALSO FOR THE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPACT IN AROUND THE DELTA WHO I REPRESENT -- WE FEEL GOING FORWARD THIS IS A TOOL WITHOUT. THE INCREASING COST WITHOUT. THE PUTTING MORE DELAYS IN THE SYSTEM THAT MAKES -- THE COMMUNITIES THAT THE THAT I SERVE FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE PROCESS SO YOU'RE YOU'RE INCREDIBLY CORRECT IN TERMS OF IT'S NOT THE BE ALL END. IN IT AND AND ALL. FRANKLY WE WERE GOING TO COME HERE TODAY WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT WOULD SIMPLY WASTE YOUR TIME THIS IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION. TO A VERY COMPLEX -- THE PROBLEM AND WE YOU KNOW JUST. THE NEED THE LEGISLATURE'S SUPPORT OF THIS -- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS ARE BOTH SIDES OF THIS EQUATION AND AND AND THAT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL THANK YOU. I JUST GENERALLY MY LAST COMMENT -- YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS BEEN A VERY WELL BALANCED SENATOR. AND AND WILLING TO TAKE ON SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES ON OUR STATE AND THIS IS DEFINITELY. ONE I THINK THIS BILL MAKES A LOT OF WORK BUT I THINK. YOU'RE THE YOU'RE THE RIGHT PERSON AND TAKE THIS ISSUE ON IF IF YOU IF YOU REALLY INTEND TO AND I WANNA SUPPORT IN DOING THAT. I CAN FOR THE MEANTIME -- ALL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY SO YOU CAN CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BUT YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF YOU. AS USUAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO -- CENTER HERTZBERG I HAD AND THEN SENATOR JACKSON'S. WHITE. IT IS THIS NOTION OF THE CONTRACTS IN THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACTS WHY. CAN'T. SENATOR YOU ACHIEVE THE SAME TRANSPARENCY RESULTS BY BASICALLY DISCLOSING THE BUDGETS PROPOSING THE BUDGET IS CLOSING ALL THE INFORMATION. RATHER THAN HAVING THE CONTRACT REVIEW PERIOD BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE JUST DID. A NUDE COMMITTEE WITH THE JOINT COMMITTEE WITH THE BUDGET LOOKING AT THESE CONTRACTS AND STUFF. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND AS LEGISLATURE'S VERY OF OF A SINGLE TO EVERY PROVISION OF THESE CONTRACTS AND THE LIKE CAN'T YOU WOULD SHE THE TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU ARE SEEKING TO DO. WITHOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES NOW THE ARGUMENT IS. IF IN FACT IS THE OTHER SIDE MAKES THE POINT YOU KNOW I MEAN LIKE SAYS. I'M AN LA GUY HI SO I I SUPPORT THE WATER FIX IN A BIG WAY AND JUST WATCH AND THEY'LL. DISCLOSE THAT UP FRONT SO SO BUT IT'S TO THE QUESTION IT HAS BEEN THIS TENSION THAT WE'VE SEEN EXIST SINCE THE DAYS OF BUT JERRY BROWN'S -- PERIPHERAL CAN THAT STUFF AND SO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS CHALLENGE OF WE READ THANKS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STEALING YOUR PRISTINE WATER. THE END AND I GET THAT. BUT WE'RE DOWN THE ROAD I THINK THAT WITH THE GOVERNOR DID TO REDUCE IT TO ONE TUNNEL YOU KNOW THERE WAS TO BE PLAYED AT THE IS A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT -- IN IN WHERE WE ARE THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN YOU -- IT HERE TO ON THE ONE HAND THE SENSITIVITIES THAT YOU APPROPRIATELY EXPRESS. TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS LIKE YOU THEY ASK YOU QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM ANSWERS FAIR QUESTION AND NOT DELAY THE PROJECT IF IN FACT THE PURPOSE OF THIS. IS NOT -- TO JUST TO LET AND BECAUSE ANOTHER WRENCH IF IT'S JUST TRANSPARENCY WHAT'S A LESSER INCLUDED APPROACH. TO ACHIEVE TRANSPARENCY CRITICAL OBJECTIVE WITHOUT A DELAY THE IDEA WHERE IF YOU WERE DISCLOSED AS WAS SUGGESTED. YOU KNOW ALL THE BUDGET ALL THE CONTRACTS DISCLOSE EVERYTHING. BUT THE PROCESS OF A BUS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVING THIS REVIEW. AND THE IN A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE JP EIGHT TO ME -- I LOOK AT IT AS A NECESSARY LAYER YOU CAN ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVES BY JUST SIMPLY DISCLOSING ALL OF THOSE DOCUMENTS WITHOUT A DELAY. AS ONE HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS. WALLS IS WE HEARD TESTIMONY TODAY -- THOSE DO NOT THOSE DOCUMENTS DON'T ALWAYS MATCH UP. ADD -- BRINGING THAT BEFORE THE JBL SEE -- SEEMS TO BE. A ONCE IN A LESS -- APPROACH -- TO GETTING TRANSPARENCY AND WE ALSO. MY FEELING WAS AS BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. THAT WE TOOK OUT THE EXCESSIVE DELAYS -- IN THE PROCESS AND ALSO KNOCKED OUT -- THE EXCESSIVE COSTS WHAT WOULD IT HELP AND I DON'T INTERRUPT YOUR LANGUAGE WOULD HELP US TO JUST RUN THROUGH VERY BRIEFLY FOR THE MEMBERS HERE WHAT EXACTLY THESE AMENDMENTS ENTAIL THAT THEY'RE GREAT [inaudible] OFF YEAH. LET'S WALK THROUGH THOSE JUST VERY BRIEFLY IT IS. THEY ARE INSUFFICIENT ADMITTEDLY FOR THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS METROPOLITAN MY HOBBY AND THE OPPONENTS FROM MY UNDERSTANDING STILL REMAIN OPPOSED. EVEN WITH -- THE THE AMENDS BUT AT THE MOMENT SAID SENATOR DODD IS ALREADY COMMITTED TAKING FROM THE COMMITTEE. WOULD SET A A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD ON THE THE TYPES OF CONTRACTS THAT THE JEEP. THE DEVICE. YES FIVE MILLION DOLLAR THAT THOSE WITH THAT THAT WOULD HAVE TO YOUR REPORTED -- TO THE JAIL BC AND THE RELEVANT POLICY COMMITTEES -- WE'VE WE WOULD BE STRIKING. THE MAN. THE THE THE SORT OF PRE CONDITION ON ACTUALLY EXECUTING THE CONTRACT. FOR LEGISLATIVE HEARING TO OCCUR BEFORE THAT SO THAT AGE THREE LOT INFORMATION READY EXACTLY -- WE ELIMINATE THE NEED. TO TO REPORT THEN ON THE A PERMANENT TRANSFERS OF CONTRACTUAL WATER -- AS NOTED THE ANALYSIS. MAYBE SORT OF ARBITRATOR RELEVANT TO THE BROADER ISSUE THAT THE SENATORS TRYING. TO ACHIEVE -- AND THEN WE ALSO DO WOULD WOULD WOULD ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT ON WOULD HAVE WHAT IS PAGE FOUR LINES LINES SEVEN THROUGH -- TWELVE AS SUBSECTIONS HE WHICH WOULD -- BAR THE WHO THE ORIGINAL WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A LEGISLATIVE. HEARING PRIOR TO EXECUTION OF THAT LONG TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENT -- SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE UICK SUMMARY AND THE ISSUE I THINK THAT WE'VE SORT OF HONED IN ON HERE IS. WHAT'S THE MOST MEANINGFUL KIND OF TRANSPARENCY AND AND WHAT -- IF I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH BUT WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE THE PROPONENTS ARE ASKING FOR SAYING. WE WANT -- THE THE CONTRACTS THEMSELVES BROUGHT FORTH AND THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT REPORTED TO THIS JAIL BE SEE THE ACTUAL. DOCUMENTS THEMSELVES THE TERMS CONDITIONS THERE IN. HERE TO FOUR WE'VE WE'VE WORKED WITH THE BUDGE STRUCTURES RIGHT SO WE'VE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT OKAY WHAT ARE THEY PUTTING INTO FOUR BASE CONSTRUCTION IN TAKES TUNNELS AND SORT OF LOOKING AT SORT OF THE RESERVE A BREAK DOWN OF WHAT THEY'RE PROJECTED BUDGET AS WELL AS WHAT THEIR ACTUAL. FINAL BUDGET IS AND THEN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DRILL DOWN AND WITHIN THAT AND SAY OKAY SOMETHING LOOKS AMISS HERE YOUR COST OF GOING UP YOUR COST OF GONE WAY DOWN. AND WE STILL HAVE THE POWER TO LOOK AT THOSE. UP TO THIS POINT WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD A REQUIREMENT LAW SAYING PUT THE ACTUAL CONTRACTS FOR TO THE JAIL BC SO. HI I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S A MEANINGFUL KIND OF TRANSPARENCY FOR US TO HAVE HOW MUCH DOES THE LEAD PUMP WHAT IS TMI AND WHAT IS NOT RIGHT WHAT WHAT LIKE WHAT. WHAT WHAT LEVEL IF WE GET A STACK OF HUNDREDS OF CONTRACTS IS THAT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE USEFUL TO THE JAIL BC TO DO OVERSIGHT -- TO THIS COMMITTEE VERSES SAY A BUDGET DOCUMENT SO I I THINK THAT'S SORT OF WHERE WE'VE WE'VE LANDED POLICY. I'LL COME BACK YES OR THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN IT AND THAT'S THE QUESTION IS THIS THIS IS ONE OF THESE AREAS I THINK. WHERE THERE'S ENOUGH EYEBALLS ON IT RIGHT THAT EVERY COMMA OF EVERY CONTRACT EVERY DOLLAR IN THE GAME IS GOING TO BE ANALYZED BY THE OPPONENTS? TO THE PROCESS RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE NOBODY'S PAYING ATTENTION YOU GOT ALWAYS WATER AGENCIES OUT THERE. EVERYBODY IS IS IN THE PROCESS SOTHE QUESTION BECOMES. BOB GOOD FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR YOUR YOUR ANALYSIS EXACTLY CORRECT IS THAT OKAY. IF EVERYBODY'S GONNA KNOW THAT IS THERE A VENUE BY WHICH THEY CAN BRING THAT TO SOMEBODY'S ATTENTION AND DOES THE BRINGING OF THE ATTENTION. AS SENATOR CABALLERO TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THAT A STATUTORY DELAY IN THE PROCESS. BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS EVEN IF THERE IS NO PROBLEM YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE A STATUTORY DELAY IN THE TIME LINE WHEN THERE MIGHT NOT BE A NEED TO HAVE. ONE RIGHT AND SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY BELIEVE ME THE ALARMS WILL SOUND YOU KNOW THE POINT THAT WAS RAISED THAT WE HAD MEETINGS EVERY. HEARINGS EVERY YEAR ON THIS CON ON THIS PART I DID THOSE HEARINGS YOU KNOW SO I I COMPLETELY AGREE AND TERMS OF ANY CHALLENGES AND WE'RE ON IT SO. I DON'T KNOW A CENTER DOT I MEAN. THERE IS LEGITIMACY TO THE LARGER ARGUMENT IN MY JUDGMENT THAT THERE HAS BEEN ATTENTION. AND THAT THERE'S ALWAYS SUSPICION ON BOTH SIDES JUST THE WAY IT IS. QUESTION IS HOW CAN YOU ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE THAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE AND AVOID THAT SUSPICION. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YEAH. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS CENTER ERTZBERG SENATE JACKSON DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT QUESTION. I APOLOGIZE SAID. I WASN'T ABLE TO BE HERE AS BEING PUT THROUGH MY PACES IN SENATOR DODD'S COMMITTEE -- SO -- I I GUESS [inaudible] THE ISSUE. ARE THE ARE SENSIBLE ISSUE IS ONE OF TRANSPARENCY. BUT THERE'S MORE TO THIS -- AND SO I WOULD LIKE -- IF SOMEONE COULD SHARE WHAT THE CONCERN IS BEYOND THE TRANSPARENCY IS. THE CENTER HERTZBERG INDICATED YOU KNOW NOBODY TRUSTS ANYBODY. I THINK THAT'S A FOR STATEMENT WHETHER THERE'S HISTORICAL BASIS FOR THAT ARE JUST IS IT IS THE WAY IT IS. WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT WHAT IS THE UNDERLYING REASON? THAT YOU'RE HERE SEEKING THIS TRANSPARENCY OR OR NG TO SEEK THIS TRANSPARENCY THAT OTHERS ARE SAYING NO. WE NEED TO DO IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCE OF HOW AND WHETHER WE WILL ACHIEVE THAT TRANSPARENCY. GREATEST CONCERN ON WHEN YOU. LOOK AT THE EVALUATION OF STATE WATER CONTRACT IS THAT THE WATER DELIVERIES. HAVE TO BE CERTAIN TO BE THERE FOR THE BOND REPAYMENTS CAN EVENTUALLY BE MADE. THE CONTRACTS REVEAL. THE WATER DELIVERIES AND THE ALLOTMENTS. IN ADDITION TO WHAT IS NORMALLY LOOKED AT AS FAR AS REVENUES. AND SO WHEN OF WHEN A CONTRACT COMES IN THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME TIME. AREN'T WE BELIEVE FOR US TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT THEY CAN ASK THE MEANING FOR QUESTIONS -- OF THE CONTRACT [inaudible] BECAUSE UNLESS THESE CONTRACTS ARE. APPROPRIATE AND MEANINGFUL WE WON'T BE REPAYING THE BOND. IS AND AND SO WHY ARE THE FOLKS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. NOT HAPPY WITH THIS BILL BUT YOU FEEL YOU NEED TO BRING THIS BILL. ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. WELL I FIGURED IT LIVES UP THE COST WITH THE WATER DELIVERS ASKS -- SHE IS -- I DISCUSSED. AND I THINK IT'S NOT ONLY FOR THE REPRESENTATIVES THAT REPRESENT THE DELTA AREAS. I THINK THIS IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR LET'S SAID JULES AND MODERATE SEEING DIEGO IN THE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COSTS THAT WATER IS SO WHEN THOSE RATES DO GO OUT FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROCESS. THAT EITHER THE LEGISLATURE KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS -- EACH YEAH THAT IT CAN GET REPRESENT ADEQUATELY REPRESENT. YOU ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS SO THERE'S A CONCERN THAT THE INFORMATION IS NOT BEING ACCURATELY RELAYED TO THE RATE PAYERS. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I THINK EVERYWHERE FRANKLY IS IS THE IS A DETERMINATION THAT -- THE THAT HAS BEEN MADE. BUT I THINK IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO TAT -- THE OLD. AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE IS RISK AND REWARDS IN EVERY PROJECT. AND I THINK THIS REALLY ALLOWS. THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND. INTO A COMPREHENSIVE WAY THE RISK AND REWARDS. OF SUCH A PROJECT TO NOT ONLY THE BROADER STATE -- MOVING FORWARD BUT ALSO TO THOSE THAT ARE -- INTIMATELY IMPACTED IN THE DELTA REGION. AND SO YOU YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT IF ALL THIS INFORMATION WERE MADE KNOWN. THAT THE THAT THE COST WELL IT WHAT YOU WOULD PERCEIVE IS LIKELY PROHIBITIVE WOULD BE MADE KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE PROJECT OR PROMOTE THE PROJECT BECAUSE THE COST IS TOO GREAT. I WOULDN'T MAKE THAT IT PRESUMPTION I WOULD ASSUME THAT THE PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS RECEIVING FOR THE MONEY THAT'S SPENT. EVEN A SINGLE TUNNEL PROJECT WILL BECOME. WITH COST OVERRUNS INTEREST REPAYMENTS AND BOND THAT -- AND AND OPERATIONS THE SECOND LARGEST OR SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHAT WAS RELATED TO RATE PAYERS AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T MATCH WATER BOARD TESTIMONY. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS. THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME. HOW DOES THAT CONTRACT MATCH UP WITH THESE OTHER PROCESSES SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR WHAT WE'RE PAYING? SO THROUGH THE CHAIR COULD WE HAVE. A GOOD ONE OF THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS. OF LEGISLATION FROM THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- SURE THEIR PERSPECTIVES I'M JUST TRYING TO THEIR WITH WATER THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING MORE THAN WHAT'S ON THE SURFACE. THAT I I'M JAY WATER CONTRACTORS ARE HERE YEAH WELL RIGHT I MEAN IT'S SHOCKING SHOCKING I AM I AM SHOCKED THE PERSPECTIVE IS OF WHAT UNDER THE SURFACE. FROM THE FOLKS WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING I'M JENNIFER PAIR THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS -- THE CONTRACTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR FOR THROUGH THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY THEY ONLY DEAL WITH DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AND NOT AGENCY WOULD ACTUALLY BE SUNSET IT AT WHEN THE CAR WATER FIXES THAN BEING CONSTRUCTED. THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WATER SUPPLY CONTRACT OR HOW WATER IS DELIVERED OR WHEN IT'S OPERATED OR HOW IT'S OPERATED IT'S LITERALLY JUST AN AGENCY TO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT. THE PROJECT AND IN A PUBLIC WAY WITH A PUBLIC BOARD SO THAT IT CAN PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY. SECOND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE ISSUE THIS WE STILL HAVE A DELAY ISSUE THIS IS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT. PROBABLY EVEN WITH ONE TUNNEL. AND AT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INCREMENTS THAT IS GOING TO BE AN EXCESSIVE ACTIVITY OF BRINGING THAT IN FRONT OF YOU AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT INSTEAD OF DOING. INCREMENTAL FIVE MILLION DOLLAR -- SUBMITTALS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AN ANNUAL BUDGET WHICH ACTUALLY IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SEEMS AS PURPOSE THOUGHT IS TO MARRY THE TOTALITY OF THE ACTIVITIES GOING ON WITH THE DCA. WITH THE TOTALITY OF THE COSTS IN THAT PARTICULAR YEAR I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT AND THE GPA REQUIRES THAT WHEN THERE IS A 5% INCREASE IN BUDGET. OR MORE THAN A SIX MONTH DELAY THERE'D BE ANOTHER -- DEVELOPMENT THAT COULD COME BEFORE YOU AND THAT'S BEING PROPOSED AND AND SOME OF OUR AMENDMENT SO WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT WHEN THERE ARE CHANGES THAT OCCUR MORE THAN ANNUALLY. THOSE CAN COME BEFORE YOU AS WELL [inaudible] GOOD. THANK YOU MUCH OF MUCH APPRECIATED. EXCELLENT -- SO WITHOUT FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS I WOULD WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON ON SOME OF THE SORT OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES WE DO APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND TAKEN THE THAT THE AMENDMENTS -- BUT THE THE THE STATE CONTRACTORS JUST POINTED OUT THAT. NOTHING IN THE THE CONTRACTS THE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE JAIL BC UNDER THE CURRENT LANGUAGE WOULD INCLUDE WATER SUPPLY YOUR DELIVERY -- INFORMATION STRICTLY RELATED I BELIEVE IT. SAYS PLANNING DESIGN -- IN CONSTRUCTION I BELIEVE IN THE NATURE THE CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS SO FOR THE RECORD I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE AND IN TERMS ACHIEVING YOUR PURPOSES HERE PROCEDURALLY. MAYBE NOT SUBSTANTIVELY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE CAN HAVE THAT. BROADER SUBSTANTIVE DEBATE TODAY AT LEAST IN THE CONFINES OF THIS BILL BUT THOUGHTS ON THIS THIS CONCEPT OF THE THE VALUE OF AN ANNUAL BUDGET. AND THEN USING THESE ARE PUBLIC THAT THE CONTRACTS ARE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS RIGHT IS SO WHAT THEY'RE ALL ACCESSIBLE PUBLICLY TO JUST WANT TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE. ON THIS WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A REASON NO BUDGET BOTH IN DRAFT FORM. AS WELL AS A FINAL BUDGET. AND TO TO MAKE THAT THE ITEM THAT'S EITHER SUBMITTED TO THE JAIL BC OR THAT WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A WATER COMMISSION SET UP TO BY THE WAY IN ADDITION TO THE TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT. THAT -- DOES THE ANNUAL REVIEW OF CONSTRUCTION OPERATION OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM SO. I'M I'M INTERESTED IN IN TRYING TO FIND SOME SOLUTION HERE THAT THAT MIGHT ACHIEVE YOUR PURPOSES WITHOUT -- PUTTING FOR DOCUMENTS THAT FRANKLY WE ARE GOING TO BE THAT MEANINGFUL TO US IF WE'RE EVALUATING HOW THE PROJECTS GOING SO. THOUGHTS ON THE DRAFT ANNUAL LIKE SORT OF THE BUDGET SUBMISSION. YEAH WELL I I GUESS WHAT I'D HAVE TO SAY IS -- IT -- THEY MAY NOT BE THEY MAY NOT BE IMPORTANT AS IT'S BEEN PRESENTED HERE TODAY. BUT IT WILL WHAT THEY MAY DO IS THEY MAY TELL THE WHOLE STORY. SO TO SPEAK AND LET ME JUST SAY. THAT -- THE IDEA THAT -- THERE THIS IS BEEN AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. HE IS -- HE FRANKLY RIDICULOUS. AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE -- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT -- IT WE I AM CERTAINLY OPEN. THE EYES THE SENATOR INDICATED -- THAT I THINK THAT'S MY MODUS OPERANDI IS TO WORK WITH PEOPLE TO TRY. TO YOU KNOW CRAFT. BETTER SOLUTIONS TO DIFFICULT PROBLEMS. I I HAVEN'T HEARD ONE HERE TODAY IN THIS HEARING YET THAT -- THAT MOVES ME BUT I'M OPEN TO DISCUSSING THIS WITH THE THE OPPONENTS OF IT MOVING FORWARD -- YEAH THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE MY REQUEST PRIOR TO MOVING THE BILL TODAY -- WITH THE AMENDMENTS IS. IS JUST THAT COMMITMENT I THINK. OPPONENTS HAVE AN INTERESTING CONCEPT FOR AN AMENDMENT. ABOUT USING THE THE ANNUAL BUDGET AS THIS SORT OF DRIVING DOCUMENT. LIKE I SAID WATER COMMISSION THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS THERE ALSO MAY BE -- SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T JUST FEEL ANNUALIZED WHERE YOU CAN MAYBE STILL USING THAT BUDGET DOCUMENT AS POSE THIS -- CONCEDED THE ARBITRARY THRESHOLD WE PUT IN HERE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- DOES HAVE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE CONSISTENT AT THEIRMAJOR CHANGE IN THE PROJECT -- SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES THINGS THAT REQUIRE JUST THE DRAFT IN THE ANNUAL SO AS LONG AS YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH A LOOK AT THAT AND WORK. VERY HARD WITH THE OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER JUST VERY AYE. THANK YOU COULD I DO AGREE THAT YOU ARE -- FABULESSLY GOOD TO WORK WITHALL THE FRONTS I JUST THINK THAT. PART OF THE ISSUE OF TRUST AND PART OF THE ISSUE. OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEKING TO ACHIEVE HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED BY THE AMENDMENTS YOU'VE TAKEN. THE BILL IS ORIGINALLY. WRITTEN BEFORE THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE WERE ONE THERE WAS NO CAP ON MONEY FIVE MILLION TO THAT IN THIS PARAGRAPH THAT WAS TAKEN OUT THE JOINT BUDGET COMMITTEE. HAS NINETY DAYS TO REVIEW ALL THE STUFF FOR EVERY SINGLE CONTRACT IN A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT AS WELL OVER THOUSAND CONTRACTS WILL GO TO THIS COMMITTEE THEY WILL ALL BE REVIEWED WHATEVER IT IS. AND THEN ONCE THE REVIEWED IN THE GIVES IS THE WINDOW FOR THE SLOW DOWN. THE ONLY ARGUMENT MAKES YOU IS THAT WELL OF COSTS GO UP THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME -- REVERSION IN TERMS OF COSTS TO RATEPAYERS ARGUABLY BUT PRETTY THIN. MY POINT IS THAT NOW YOU'VE TAKEN THESE AMENDMENTS. IF YOU THINK THROUGH EUROPE OBJECTIVE OF TRANSPARENCY I WOULD JUST SUGGEST AND SUGGESTIONS IF WE PASS THIS BECAUSE I CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE I'M SITTING HERE AND I APOLOGIZE AND GET THE AS SOON -- TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE EVER VOTE AGAINST THE DOT BILL BECAUSE THEY VOTE AGAINST FAMILY BUT TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE THAT WE'LL WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS. THREE THOUGHT THROUGH CONSISTENT WITH THE I THINK IT'S REALLY HAS CHANGED. OF FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT YOUR ORIGINAL. INITIATIVE WAS WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTENTS OF THE MEASURE. YOU KNOW IT'S A WHETHER IT'S A BUDGET PROCESS OR SOMETHING ELSE BUT THE NOTION IS TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT DELAY I THINK THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO SEND YEAR. TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT DELAY AND CREATING THIS THE AND CLEARLY THIS HAD A 100% ROAD BLOCK UNTIL IT WAS TAKEN OUT BY THE COMMITTEE. AND THE STILL ARGUABLY SOME ROAD BLOCKS AND THE IDEA IS TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT DELAY IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT CHAIR MERECE -- SO WITH WITH YOUR COMMITMENT. AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS I THINK. LONG AND WE'RE GONNA JUST KEEP WORKING ON THIS. I THINK WE CAN MOVE THIS TODAY -- I YEAH I I DO APPRECIATE CENTER HERTZBERG. COMMENTING CONCERNS I ALSO WOULD ENCOURAGE A STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY. TO THE THE NATURE THIS HEARING YOU KNOW. WE'VE GOT A TRUNCATED PERIOD OF REVIEW IN GENERAL. AT OPPOSITION COME LATE WE'VE HAD SUPPORT WITH. THIS SPEAKING AMENDMENTS COME LATE SO HOPEFULLY GOING FOR WE HAVE WE CAN BAKE SOME OF THIS MORE FULLY BUT I DO APPRECIATE JUST.
