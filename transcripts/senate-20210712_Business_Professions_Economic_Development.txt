EIGHTY THREE FIVE NINE WELL DRESSED CALIFORNIANS PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES PRACTICING CALIFORNIA ALLEGEDLY INCREASED ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND IMPROVE PATIENT HEALTH OUTCOMES. CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE ALLOWS OUT OF STATE DOCTORS OF OSTEOPATHY TO RECEIVE A LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN CALIFORNIA. PROVIDED THEY HOLD UNDER STRICT IT AND UNLIMITED LICENSE IN GOOD STANDING IN ANOTHER STATE CONVERSELY IN THESE NOT PROVIDE THE SAME RECIPROCITY. IN FACT THE BEST PROFESSIONS CODE CONTAINS LANGUAGE THAT INDICATES THAT ANY DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TREATMENT OF INDIES AND DEAL WITH IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. EIGHTY THREE FIVE NINE WOULD MODIFY THE EXISTING RECIPROCITY REQUIREMENTS FOR OUT OF STATE INDIES MAKING THEM CONSISTENT WITH THE RECIPROCITY STATUTES THAT I REPLY TO OTHER INDEPENDENT. OUT OF STATE HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS LIKE DOCTORS ARE ALL TOO PATH THESE. SPECIFICALLY THEBILL OUT PHYSICIANS WHO ARE LICENSED IN ANOTHER STATE BUT PAST STEP THREE THE UNITED STATES MEDICAL LIFE EXAM ON THEIR FIFTH OR SIXTH TRY TO SEE THE LICENSE WITHIN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS CRITICAL TO BRING A NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS WHO DESIRE TO PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT CAN'T UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL RESPECTED MEDICAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM TO ENSURE THAT POSITIONS ARE EDUCATED ABOUT THE LATEST MEDICAL PRACTICE TECHNIQUES. THESE COURSES THE ONLY COST 230% OF THE POSITIONS REQUIRED CMT. BY WITNESSES MISS HITS PLUS CONSPECIFIC TYPES OF C. N. B. C. B. THREE FIVE NINE THE HELP ADDRESS OUR PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE OR REQUIRING THESE NEW POSITIONS TO BE QUALIFIED. TO HAVE PASSED ALL STANDARDIZED TEST. A FULLY LICENSED AND IN GOOD STANDING IN ANOTHER STATE. THE CME CREDIT EXPANSION WILL- MEDIC- PRACTICES TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND SAFE. WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT DURING THIS CHALLENGING TIME. I HAVE OFTEN BEEN TO SOME OF THE BOARD CONCERN. ONE THING YOU CONSULT SIR MASON FOR OF OUR- WITH THIS BILL. THERE WERE TWENTY TWO MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORTING THE BILL. THIS BILL IS ENJOY UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE. WITH THEIR WITNESSES DR ARORA ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR AT THE USC OF MEDICINE AND JULIANA HENCE. THE MAZE DIRECTOR OF CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION. WITNESSES PLEASE PROCEED. MR CHAIRMAN AND IF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DR LAURA I'M ALSO IN PRIVATE PRACTICE DOESN'T ONLY DOCTOR WITH YOUR IDEA DOCTOR WITH YOU HOLD UP A SECOND WE CANNOT HEAR YOU SO WE WILL ADJUST TO. MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT HERE. IS IT CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE- BETTER PLEASE SPEAK UP THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM DOCTOR AURORA I'M ALSO IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AS AN OBGYN FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA AND EXPECTED TO ACCENTUATE FURTHER BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND EXPANSION TO EVENTUAL UNIVERSALLY CARE. I HAVE EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND THE SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS IN OUR STATE AS I HAVE TRIED TO RECRUIT POSITIONS FOR MY PRACTICE. IT HAS BEEN THE SAME DILEMMA TRYING TO ADD POSITIONS TO THE MATERNITY DEPARTMENT AT MY LOCAL HOSPITAL. THE SOLE INTENT AND PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. ONLY ALLOWS FULLY QUALIFIED AND TRAINED PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE PASSED ALL THE REQUIRED TESTS AND ARE LICENSED IN ANOTHER STATE IN GOOD STANDING. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY STILL HAVE TO FULFILL ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL SIMPLY REMOVES THE ARBITRARY LMIT THE POTENTIAL. FOR PASSAGE OF USMLE STEP THREE EXAMS FOR LICENSURE. DOCTORS OF OSTEOPATHY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME LIMIT. THE EXISTING ALTERNATE PATHWAYS DO NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL SUB GROUP OF PHYSICIANS. I HAVE LEARNED FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN TEACHING RESIDENTS AT USC AND IN MY INTERACTION WITH OTHER POSITIONS THAT THERE IS NO GOOD CORRELATION BETWEEN STANDARDIZED TEST TAKING AND BEING A GOOD POSITION SOME PHYSICIANS ARE NOT GOOD **** BECAUSE OF VARIOUS REASONS BUT THEY CAN BE THE MOST EMPATHETIC AND KIND POSITIONS AND THE MOST SKILLFUL SURGEONS. TO SUMMARIZE THIS BILL POTENTIALLY ADDS HUNDREDS TO THE POSITION PRONE TO RENDER MUCH NEEDED CARE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS EVERY POSITION EQUALS ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND PATIENT VISITS PER YEAR.AND THE BILL HAS NO DOWNSIDE WHATSOEVER. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT HEALTH CARE BILL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE.

GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS ERIN BONE WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA HAS INDICATED IN THE ANALYSIS THE BOARD IS REGRETTABLY OPPOSED TO LISTEN UNTIL THREE FIFTY NINE. ARCHITECTING COMPONENT OF THE BILL CURRENT LAW PROVIDES ADDITIONAL PATHWAYS TO LICENSURE INCLUDING THE APPLICANTS WHO REQUIRED MORE THAN FOUR TIMES TO PASS THE UNITED STATES MEDICAL LICENSING EXAMINATION FOR US AND THE ONLY. OTHER PATHWAYS ARE FREQUENTLY USED AS ONE HUNDRED EVERY SIX LICENSES ISSUED EACH YEAR GOES TO ONE OF THESE APPLICANTS CURRENTLY LICENSED IN ANOTHER STATE. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THIS PORTION OF THE BILL IS CONTRARY TO THE NATIONAL POLICY ON THE NUMBER OF ALLOWED ATTEMPTS TO PASS THE EXAM. AS OF THIS MONTH UNDER U. S. GENERALLY RULES A FIRING POSITIONS ARE NOW LIMITED TO FOUR ATTEMPTS TO PASS THE EXAM. WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. GIVEN THIS POLICY IN A SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF OUT OF STATE POSITIONS SUCCESSFULLY OBTAINED A LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA. THE BENEFIT OF THIS BILL. TO CONSUMERS IT'S UNCLEAR TO THE BOARD. WHAT THE BOARD CONSIDER THIS BILL DURING THE MOST READ MEETING OUR MEMBERS WERE CONCERNED BY THE LACK OF EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE SPONSORS ON THE BILL'S IMPACT TO CONSUMERS. IT IS UNKNOWN TO THE BOARD HOW MANY ARTISTIC POSITIONS WHO DESIRE TO PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS TO LICENSURE AVAILABLE TODAY THE CURRENT LAW. WITHOUT SUCH EVIDENCE THE BOARD WAS UNABLE TO EVALUATE HOW MANY CAN HELP CONSUMERS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THIS PROVISION OF THE BILL. WITH REGARD TO THE CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION PORTION I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS FOR COLLABORATING ON ARTISAN AND IS DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT CLARIFIES THE NOTE THAT THE BOARD HAS NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER THIS LANGUAGE. AT THE LIMIT WHAT WAS PUT IN THE- AFTER THE BOARD ITS- LAW REQUIRES. SCHOOL FOR. DIRECTLY CARE. AND THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE- OF A MAN LICENSE WHICH IS DIAGNOSE AND TREAT. FURTHER LOT OF PROHIBIT PHYSICIAN FROM TO BUSINESS. IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. BUT APPROPRIATELY THOSE COURSES TO NOT COUNT TOWARDS. WORK AT THOSE COURSES ARE NOT RELATED TO THE SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE USED BY PHYSICIANS TO PROVIDE CARE TO THEIR PATIENTS. CONCERNS WITH EIGHTY THREE FIFTY NINE THE POOR RECORD REQUEST RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. AND AS A REMINDER TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY THREE FIVE NINE PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. MR SURE NOBODY IS QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU LET'S NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CHAMBER CALLING CITY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. SIR BEN I THANK YOU SO MUCH ACTUALLY I DO HAVE A QUESTION OF THE MEMBER FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD IS. THAT THE APPROPRIATE. CERTAINLY IF TE MEDICAL BOARD REPRESENTATIVE IS STILL ON THE LINE. FIX YOUR QUESTION DOCTRINE YEAH ACTUALLY IT'S- TWO PARTS- SO FIRST OF ALL- REGARDING TESTIMONY. ON THIS ON THE CME- I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE BOARD'S POSITION ABOUT. THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE INTO SOMEONE WHO IS ON THIS COMMITTEE IS FREQUENTLY TALKED TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING SURE WE HAVE GOOD C. M. E. BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TALK CLARIFIED WHAT'S THE BOARD TO PETITION- FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW WHAT WE TALK ABOUT SYSTEMS BASED PRACTICE THAT'S WHAT ACTUALLY COMPETENCIES IN THE ACGME- THAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THE PHYSICIANS THAT HAVE. THOSE INCLUDE THINGS SUCH AS BEING YELP INSURING THAT YOU ORGANIZE YOUR PRACTICE IN A WAY THAT- ENGENDER STATION SAFETY FOR EXAMPLE THE RESPONSE THE COVETED- THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES WITH THAT- EIGHT IS THAT NOT VIEWED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OUR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT TYPE EFFORTS. WHICH AGAIN TALKS ABOUT PROCESS SEES THAT HAPPEN IN THE PRACTICE IS THAT NOT INTERPRETED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD IS- THAT IS BEING- FITTING- THIS IS QUALIFYING FOR CME SO THAT'S QUESTION NUMBER ONE. AND THEN I GUESS THE SECOND QUESTION IS THAT I KNOW IN THE ANALYSIS AND THE TESTIMONY THEY SAID THAT THERE THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS- FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO. IS QUALIFIED TO PRACTICE IN ANOTHER STATE SO WE HAVE- WHO WISHES TO COME TO CALIFORNIA WHO MAY NOT HAVE ACTUALLY- I GUESS PAST THE USMLE AND WITHIN THE FIRST. FOUR- FOR. FOUR TIMES AFTER- IT IS CAN CAN YOU GIVE ME MORE OF A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THAT PATHWAY THEN ENTAILS- THAT TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO USE TO STILL BE ABLE TO PRACTICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AFTER THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY SHOW THEY'VE BEEN AT A PRACTICE SAFELY IN ANOTHER STATE SO WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THOSE TWO ISSUES THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ME THANK YOU. IS THE MEDICAL REPORT REPRESENTATIVE STILL ON THE LINE. NOW DOCTOR PAN THAT MAY BE A RHETORICAL QUESTION MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER IT. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I CAN CERTAINLY DON'T SPEAK FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT I'VE BEEN HELPFUL TO HEAR FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD AND THOSE THINGS I AM ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT ASTONISHED THAT- THE INTERPRETATION- IT'S ACTUALLY RECOGNIZING THAT WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION SYSTEM BASED PRACTICE IS ONE OF THE COMPETENCIES WE ACTUALLY TRAIN POSITIONS FOR- SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO FIX THIS ISSUE I DO WONDER IF. THE WAY THE MEDICAL BOARD IS INTERPRETED SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES IS NOT QUALIFYING FOR CME MAY NOT HAVE. BEEN ABLE TO NARROW BUT AGAIN IT'S THEIR JUDGMENT I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT IN THIS BILL AND- CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW THE CODE SECTIONS ARE NICE- AND ANALYSIS BUT DIDN'T REALLY DESCRIBE WHAT SOMEONE HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO- SO AGAIN APPRECIATE THAT- WE'RE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRACTICE IN GOOD STANDING IN OTHER STATES. AND I THINK HAVING SOME CLARITY AS TO WHAT THOSE ALTERNATE PATHWAYS WERE FROM THE BOARD WITHIN HELPFUL TO KNOW WHAT WHAT THAT INVOLVED BUT I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT- I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO DO IS HAVE TO GO WITH THIS BUILDING THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR PLAN FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR COMMENTS CALLINGS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR ARCH ALETTA.

UNDER THIS BILL THE ADDITIONAL VACCINES TO THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR DENTISTS AND PODIATRISTS HIS CONDITION ON THE SAME TRAINING AND RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS THE PHARMACISTS ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO COMPLETE IN ORDER TO ADMINISTER VACCINES. ADDITIONALLY AB FIVE TWENTY SIX WOULD INCLUDE THE FLU SHOT WHICH IS ANOTHER VACCINE PHARMACIST MADE MINISTER FOR WHICH EXPANDED ACCESS IS OF SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. IN TWENTY TEN I AUTHORED AB SEVENTEEN TEN A BILL THAT AUTHORIZES PHARMACISTS TO INDEPENDENTLY INITIATED. INFLUENZA VACCINES APPROVED OR AUTHORIZED BY THE FDA. THIS BILL MAHER IS THAT BILL BY ALLOWING APPROPRIATELY TRAINED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO ADMINISTER VACCINES AND TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CODE NINETEEN THE IMMUNIZATIONS. OFFERING VACCINES AT EVERY ENTRY POINT IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WILL EASE VACCINE HESITANCY OF SAFETY CONCERNS AND TURN IMMUNIZATION INTO A CONCERTED COORDINATED HEALTH CARE EFFORT. THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL ALIGNS CALIFORNIA LABORATORY REGISTRATION STATUTE WITH FEDERAL LAW SO THE DENTIST CAN OBTAIN THE APPROPRIATE STATE REGISTRATION ALONG SIDE THEIR FEDERAL LICENSURE IN ORDER TO CONDUCT SIMPLE RELIABLE WAY TO TEST THAT ARE WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE. DESERT CURRENTLY NOT ABLE TO REGISTER AS LABORATORY DIRECTOR TO OVERSEE WEIGHT TEST UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. TO PERFORM QUOTE UNQUOTE WAVES TEST DENNIS IN CALIFORNIA- REQUIRED TO OBTAIN.

THANK YOU MR CHAIR MEMBERS AB TEN SIXTY FOUR IS A TIMELY RESPONSE TO OUR STATE'S ACTION TO THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THE WORK OF OUR PHARMACISTS OPERATING ON THE FRONT LINES TO MINISTER THEY WILL BACK SCENES WHETHER IT'S AN INDEPENDENT PHARMACISTS PER ONE FROM WHAT WHEN A NATIONAL CHAINS PHARMACISTS HAVE STEPPED UP TO ASSIST IN CARING FOR CALIFORNIANS LAST YEAR LEGISLATION BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA ROSA AUTHORIZE PHARMACISTS TO ADMINISTER THE COVER NINETEEN VACCINE TO HELP RELIEVE THE STRESSES ON OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND TO HELP US REACH OUR COMMUNITY THIS BILL WILL EXPAND PHARMACIST VACCINATION THIRTY TWO ALL THAT SEEMS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR CALIFORNIANS CURRENTLY PHARMACIST MAY MINISTER VACCINES LISTED UNDER ROUTINE IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULES RECOMMENDED BY THE BY THREE COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES. OR THERE'S A DELAY BETWEEN WHEN A VACCINE IS APPROVED BY THE FDA AND WHEN IT IS REVIEWED BY THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THERE ARE STILL A NUMBER OF VACCINATIONS APPROVED BY THE FDA BUT NOT ON ROUTINE IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULES I WANT TO ASSURE THE COMMITTEE AND MY COLLEAGUES THE A SET RECOMMENDATION PROCESS WILL BE FOLLOWED THE SIMPLE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO UTILIZE COMMUNITY PHARMACIES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO NEED TAXATION SERVICES. PHARMACISTS ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WITH YEARS OF EDUCATION EXPERIENCE TO EARN THEIR DOCTOR PHARMACY NOT ONLY ARE PHARMACIES AVAILABLE IN INCREDIBLY CAPABLE BUT THEY ARE TRUSTED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT PROVIDE HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND EDUCATION TO OUR CONSTITUENTS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE HEALTHCARE SERVICES YOU MUST BETTER TILIZE COMMUNITY PHARMACIES I'M JOINED TODAY BY DR RAJINDER RUSSIAN MEDIA AND MICHELLE RIVAS WITH THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION RESPECT AS PRIVATE. THANK YOU SIR WITNESSES PLEASE PROCEED. RESEARCHER AND MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE TOP. TO IT YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS DR RUSSIAN MEDIA BYTES PER. CRACKED TO PROVIDE DEVELOPMENT AT THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION. PARTICIPANTS SAFELY PROVIDING VACCINES SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETY. OVER THE YEAR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN PHARMACIST INCREASING AUTONOMY AND- INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINED VACCINE. NEEDS AND THEN ADMINISTER BASED ON THE EDUCATION TRAINING AND PROVEN EFFECTIVENESS IN VACCINATION EFFORTS. ARE MRS UNDERGO THREE TO FOUR YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL GRADUATE LEVEL STUDY TO RECEIVE A DOCTOR OF PHARMACY DEGREE. IN ADDITION MOST GRADUATES RECEIVED FORMAL TRAINING TO SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE VACCINE. WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PHARMACY EDUCATION. BASED ON NATIONAL EDUCATION STANDARDS FOR IMMUNIZATION TRAINING FOR THAT. FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION THE MUSICIAN TRAINING COVERS IMMUNOLOGY EPIDEMIOLOGY EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE IMPLEMENTATION. CLINICAL EVALUATION OF PATIENT HISTORY FOR PATIENT SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION. TECHNIQUES ON APPROACHING VACCINE HESITANCY PROPER MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE REACTIONS OR EMERGENCIES AND STRATEGIES ON INCREASING VACCINATIONRATES. IN ADDITION TO THE FOUNDATIONAL IMMUNIZATION TRAINING PHARMACISTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE ONE HOUR OF ONGOING CONTINUING PHARMACY EDUCATION. FOCUSED ON IMMUNIZATION AND VACCINES DURING EACH LICENSE RENEWAL PERIOD TO MAINTAIN THEIR AUTHORITY TO IMMUNIZE. THIS TRAINING PROGRAM COMBINED WITH A DOCTOR OF PHARMACY DEGREE LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS AND DEDICATION TO CONTINUING EDUCATION MAKES PHARMACISTS HIGHLY QUALIFIED TO ASSESS PATIENTS FOR INDICATIONS. AND CONTRA INDICATIONS AND THEN SAFELY VACCINATE. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE PHARMACISTS ARE AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE ALL VACCINES WHICH IS ON HE ROUTINE SCHEDULE BY THE CDC ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES A. T. I. P. AS WELL TO COVER NINETEEN VACCINE. WHILE THE FDA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVALUATING THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF VACCINES AND APPROVING THE INDICATIONS THE EASY PART. THE I. P. MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING POPULATION HEALTH. ACTING EFFECTIVENESS AND COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THE GENERAL POPULATION. ON THE H. ONE N. ONE PANDEMIC TO AS RECENTLY AS COVER NINETEEN. PHARMACIST PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN ENSURING OUR COMMUNITIES RECEIVE THE VACCINE IS NECESSARY TO SAVE LIVES. THERE WAS THE POTENTIAL FOR DELAYING PATIENT ACCESS TO LIFE SAVING VACCINES GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE VACCINES WERE NOT RECOGNIZED AS THE C. I. P. ROUTINE. VACCINATIONS BY THE CDC COMMITTEE. THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE ACCESS TO VACCINATIONS TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS BY AUTHORIZING PHARMACISTS ADMINISTER ALL AT THE APPROVED VACCINATIONS. FOR PATIENTS THREE YEARS AND OLDER. FINALLY THIS CHANGES ABOUT INCREASING ACCESS POINT FOR PATIENTS WHO CHOOSE TO RECEIVE FDA APPROVED AND AUTHORISED ACTING. IN THE RECENT YEARS WHEN THERE HAS BEEN AN OUTBREAK OF PREVENTABLE DISEASES PHARMACISTS WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE CERTAIN VACCINES. THIS DID NOT CREATE A MANDATE THIS IS A CHOICE TO RECEIVE A VACCINE WILL REMAIN BETWEEN A PATIENT AND THEIR CHILDREN HEALTHCARE PROVIDER INCLUDING PHARMACISTS. WITH THIS I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND REQUEST AND I VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU SIR NEXT PLEASE. YOUR WORK WERE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.

VACCINES HAVE BEEN APPROVED THAT ARE NOT NECESSARY PART OF ROUTINE SCHEDULE SO I KNOW WHERE THE VACCINES AS MENTIONED FOR EXAMPLE LIKE YELLOW FEVER VACCINE OR OTHER TYPES OF VACCINES- THAT BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA BUT I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- EACH ONE OF THOSE VACCINES ACTUALLY HAS- THE ACIP GIVING RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO WHO APPROPRIATELY GETS THE VACCINE AND IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES SELL- I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT WHAT I'VE HEARD IN YOUR PRESENTATION AND EVEN IN SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND BY THE SUPPORTERS HERE IN ANALYSIS IS THAT. THE DESIRE TO GIVE VACCINES THAT HAVE BEEN FDA APPROVED BUT THE AC I. T. IS NOT PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THEIR- WHO SHOULD GET THEM AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THAT- EVEN FOR COVET THE COVETED ACT SCENES THAT- WE'VE JUST DONE EVEN IN THE PRESS OF OUR- CURRENT PANDEMIC- EVEN AFTER FIFTY- EARTH EARLY USE AUTHORIZATION. THEY WERE NOT BEGUN TO BE ADMINISTERED AND TELL THE A. C. I. T. IT'S DONE ITS REVIEW AS TO WHO SHOULD GET THE VACCINE UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. AND THAT'S THE WAY. WE DO THINGS TO BE SURE THAT THE PRO PEOPLE GET THE VACCINES. AT THE PROPERTY AND APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES IT SAID IT'S NOT JUST THE FDA APPROVAL ALONE IT IS THE FDA. FOLLOWED BY THE A. C. I. T. THE EVENTS ARE COMEDIANS ASIAN PRACTICE WHICH PART OF THE CDC. SO I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEIR STATEMENTS LIKE- THE FDA. C. I. T. TAKES TOO LONG SO. THE MEANS THAT OUR- CAN BE A- OUTSIDE OF ACTIVE MINISTER VACCINES THEY HAVEN'T HAD A SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS. BECAUSE QUOTE THEY TAKE TOO LONG EXCEPT- THEN WHO ARE THEY GIVING THEM TWO AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. SO I THINK THIS NEEDS CLARIFICATION- BECAUSE OTHERWISE I THINK WORK FOR YOU KNOW AND I GUESS THE THING THAT SCARES ME IS THAT- THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE ADMINISTERING THESE VACCINES AND DO NOT SEEM TO BE VERY AWARE OF THE ROLE THE A. C. I. T. AND SO THAT THAT'S- THAT'S- THAT'S A BIT. THAT CONCERNING AND I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT- I KNOW MY OFFICE IT REACHED OUT TO YOUR OFFICE AND THEY MADE REFERENCE TO THE- LEGEND YOU KNOW THE PASSAGE OF AB SEVENTEEN TEN LAST SESSION REGARDING KOBE BUT I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN I WENT BACK AND TOOK A LOOK AT THE BILL. VERY CLEARLY SAID THAT EVEN FOR COVERT VACCINE IT WOULD BE BASED ON- A C. I. T. THAT WAS ACTUALLY STATED STRICTLY THAT. SPECIFICALLY IN THAT PARTICULAR LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED I WAS PROUD OF THAT FOR THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION SO. I SO I THINK I'M FINE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE BUT I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT- THAT THE STATEMENTS AROUND EIGHT C. I. P. I KNOW YOU DID SAY IT TOWARD THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION. THAT YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO GET AROUND A C. I. T. BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE EXPLICITLY STATED BECAUSE- AND IN THE BILL BECAUSE I BECAUSE IT SAID I'M I'M HEARING ALSO IN PRESENT. AND SUPPORT LETTERS THAT THEY THEY TALK ABOUT. TRYING TO DO THIS BEFORE THE ACA P. EVEN GIVES RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT TO ME WOULD BE VERY CONCERNING. SO PERHAPS- YOU CAN CLARIFY. THAT THE INTENTS. OF FILE. WHAT DO YOU WISH TO HAPPEN- WITH WITH THAT IT. IS A RESULT OF THIS BILL I MEAN THIS IS THIS ARE WE GONNA HAVE IS THIS I MEAN. ARE WE HAVE PHARMACISTS GIVING VACCINES THAT HAVE JUST RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL PRIOR TO A C. I. T. RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO THE- WHO'S APPROPRIATELY. HE SHOULD PROBABLY GET THE VACCINES AND WHAT IT'S A- REMEMBER SO I APPRECIATE THE- BUT THE QUESTION IS THE CONCERN AND CERTAINLY- I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE- FROM SAN JOSE WHO AUTHORED AB SEVENTEEN TEN WHO'S HERE WHO CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- ON THIS BILL SAYS SIMPLY SAYS THAT WE WANT TO EXPAND- THE RULES COMMITTEE PHARMACIES ACAP- AS GOOD AS IT DOES MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON VACCINES AND PHARMACISTS WILL FOLLOW THE C. I. P. RECOMMENDATION- IT'S PART OF THE TRAINING AS MENTIONED BY- BUT MY WITNESS THAT IS THE BEST PRACTICE THE PHARMACIST BUT IN THE CONFUSION THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW IS THAT. THERE IS ALSO AN ACAP ROUTINE LISTED SCHEDULE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ACIP RECOMMENDATION ON BACKS OF ATTACKS NATIONS THE ROUTINE SCHEDULE IS WHAT PHARMACISTS ARE CURRENTLY ONLY ALLOWED TO MINISTER IN THE ROUTINE SCHEDULE CERTAIN VACCINES RECORDED DEFINED AS ROUTINE HOWEVER OTHERS MAY INTERPRET THAT NON ROUTINE OVER INTERPRET THOSE VACCINATIONS THAT ARE DEEMED NON LATINO DESTRUCTION UNDER THE STRICTEST INTERPRETATION PHARMACISTS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MINISTER THOSE- VACCINATIONS SO I THINK THAT THE LANGUAGE CONFUSION IS THAT WE FOLLOW THE ACIP RECOMMENDATION WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS TO ALLOW PHARMACISTS TO PROVIDE. THOSE VACCINES THE ON THE ROUTINE THIS THAT MAY NOT BE DEEMED NON ROUTINE OKAY SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THAT. DO YOU COMMIT THAT AND TO. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE RIGHT TO BEFORE THIS BILL SHOWS UP ON THE- TO CLARIFY THAT THE PHARMACISTS- IF THEY'RE GIVING VACCINES. WILL BE DOING YET- THE A. C. I. T. RECOMMENDATIONS SO AND THAT AND NOT JUST BECAUSE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW JUST AS FDA APPROVAL SO THERE'S A- GAP AND YOU KNOW THERE COULD BE VERY SHORT AS I SAID WITH THAT COVETED LITERALLY WAS IN WITHIN A WEEK WHERE THE A. C. I. T. DID THE REVIEW AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT- I'LL TELL YOU AS A PHYSICIAN I'D DO WE DON'T GIVE VACCINES UNTIL THE A. C. I. T. IS SPOKEN TO. WE DO WE DON'T JUST WAIT FOR THE FDA AND GIVE ITSELF I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION- AND IN FACT I WOULD NOTE THAT THE PRIOR LEGISLATION YEAH THAT WAS FOR TWO ALSO HAD THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE IN THERE. SO I THINK SO IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO GET LIKE A YELLOW FEVER VACCINE FINE WITH THAT BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY A C. I. T. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHO SHOULD GET IT AND SO FORTH SO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE BILL HAS THAT CLAIFICATION IN THERE BECAUSE- I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO TRAVEL I THINK JEMELE PHARMACISTS WILL DO THAT. I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ESPECIALLY GIVEN SOME OF THE STATEMENTS BEING MADE ABOUT THE BILL- THAT I SAW ON THE ANALYSIS AND FRANKLY EVEN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU START OFF BY MAKING A COMMENT ABOUT THE C. I. T. THAT WAS THAT SOMETIMES THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO WAIT AND- THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY CONCERNING NO I WENT AND CERTAINLY WOULD WOULD WOULD PLEDGE AND WORK WITH YOU AND TO SWITCH THOSE CONCERNS- THE- WE'VE LEARNED. EARLY THAT THROUGH THE SPEND AND MAKE THAT THE ROLE OF PHARMACISTS IS CRITICAL BOARD TO RELIEVE THE STRESS ON ON ON THE MEDICAL SYSTEM SO THE GOAL OF THIS IS SIMPLY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO COMMUNITY PHARMACIES ALLOW THOSE BUT THOSE VACCINATION SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED BY THEM. BUT THERE IS NO DESIRE FOR IT EVER TO BYPASS THEY SAID P. RECOMMENDATION PROCESS IT IS SOON TO BE A MINISTER'S VACCINES THAT ARE DEEMED NOT ROUTINE SO HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU OKAY ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT- I HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET IT WITH THAT CLARIFICATION THEN- THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL I'M I'M. GOING TO STAY OFF THE BILL THE COMMITTEE FOR AT I APPRECIATE PLEDGE A LOOK THE WORKING WITH YOU. AND HOPEFULLY WE GET THIS- BEFORE THE BILL SHOWS A ON THE FLOOR YOU. I THANK THE GENTLEMAN COLLEAGUES ANY FURTHER. COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. SEEING NONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FARM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

REMEMBER WHEN YOU HAVE ONE BUILT A PRESENT TODAY ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THREE TWO EIGHT PLEASE PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WILL AUTHORIZE PHARMACISTS MORE FULLY ENGAGE AND PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND ALLOW THEM TO ADMINISTER MANY CLIA WAIVED TESTS. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING TO REFINE THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL AND I'M ALSO ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. PHARMACISTS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM BY UTILIZING THEIR EXPERTISE AND ACCESSIBILITY TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY PATIENT CARE. CALIFORNIA HAS A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN OVER TAXED BY THE PANDEMIC A RAPIDLY AGING POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES WITH POOR ACCESS TO PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PRACTITIONERS PRACTITIONERS. PHARMACISTS ARE CURRENTLY NOT PERMITTED TO PROVIDE MORE THAN A FEW OF THE CLIA WAIVED TESTS THOUGH THESE TESTS ARE DEFINED BY THE FDA IS SIMPLE TESTS WITH THE LOW RISK FOR AN INCORRECT RESULTS. IT DEFINITELY PHARMACISTS ARE CURRENTLY ONLY ALLOWED TO PROVIDE HEALTH SCREENINGS FOR CONDITIONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MEDICATION REGIMENS. THIS FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THE KEY ROLE THAT PHARMACISTS ARE. CONSERVATIVE PREVENTS TO REDUCE OR MITIGATE PROGRESSION OF DISEASE BY CONDUCTING SCREENINGS AND REFERRING PATIENTS TO A POSITION AT THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT MINIMIZES BARRIERS IN CURRENT LAW BY PERMITTING PHARMACISTS TO ADMINISTER CLIA WAIVED TESTS. WITH AND WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS OF WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS AND WITH THE PATIENT'S APPROVAL NOTIFYING THE PATIENT'S PHYSICIAN OF THE RESULTS IF THE PATIENT DOESN'T HAVE A PHYSICIAN THE PHARMACIST WILL PROVIDE THE PATIENT A LIST OF PHYSICIANS CLINICS OR OTHER. HEALTH CARE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO CONTACT REGARDING CARE FOR A NORMAL RESULTS THIS PANDEMIC HAS MADE US ACUTELY AWARE OF THE SHORTCOMINGS AND BARRIERS IN OUR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. PARTICULARLY FOR UNDERSERVED. POPULATIONS AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT EXPAND ACCESS CARE. AND EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC DISEASES. AND THIS IMPROVES THE QUALITY AND CARE AND LENGTH OF LIFE WHILE REDUCING ECONOMIC BURDEN. I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS ON THIS IMPORTANT.

TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE GRANTED EVERY PHARMACIST IN THE STATE IF THE READY TO ORDER INTERPRET LAB TESTS TO MONITOR THE EFFICACY AND TOXICITY OF DRUG THERAPY. AT THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WOULD PREVENT PHARMACISTS TO PERFORM SOME OF THE SAME TEST THAT ARE CLIA WAIVED TO PROVIDE PATIENTS WITH RESULTS. IN MINUTES INSTEAD OF DAYS. HI A TEST OF BE FRIDAY TO SIMPLE. EXAMINATION AND PROCEDURES THAT IN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RISK OF EVERYONE IS RESULT. EIGHTY THIRTY TWENTY EIGHT WOULD ALSO REMOVE THE CURRENT RESTRICTIONS THE TEST. THE ONLY USE THE MONITOR FOR EFFICACY AND TOXICITY OF DRUG THERAPY THE PHARMACIST CAN ENGAGE IN PUBLIC HEALTH SCREENINGS TO THAT IDENTIFY. POTENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARDS AS AN EARLY ENTRY POINT. TO THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT CAN PULL. A GENOCIDAL CHRONIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE EARLY TO CONNECT PATIENTS WITH PHYSICIANS FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT.

FREEWAY TESTING IS NOT ONLY RELEVANT TO THE FACT THAT THE PHARMACY IS THE PHARMACISTS ARE ALSO TRAINED IN PERFORMING THESE TESTS I MEAN HEALTHCARE SETTING. THE WAY pINDIGENT COMMUNITY I SIR. MANY MANY HARD TO REACH TEENS PHARMACIES ARE READILY ACCESSIBLE AND IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT MANY INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES ARE LOCATED WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE TO. MOST OF THE POPULATION RESIDES AND PROVIDING MORE READY ACCESS TO CLEAR IT TESTING WHAT WE LACK ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE. HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF- DISASSEMBLED BILL THANK. YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. ANNEX GO TO LINE SIXTY FIVE YOUR OPEN. GET YOUR NUMBERS MICHAEL HAWKINS ON BEHALF OF THE U. B. K. BECAUSE FROM SUPPORT OF PASSAGE BILL TODAY AND INCLUSION I GO BY THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. THERE ARE NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU HAVING HEARD FROM SUPPORTERS LET'S NOW FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS IN HERE FOR MANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES. I BELIEVE- EMILY HUGHES WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION INTO MADDEN REPRESENTING VARIOUS. PHYSICIAN GROUPS ARE HERE IN THE CHAMBER TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PROCEED. YES GOOD MORNING SHERRY COMMITTEE MEMBERS EMILY HUGHES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR BEING UNABLE TO SPEAK TO EACH OF THE AMENDMENTS AS DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE SPONSORS WE WERE NOT MADE AWARE OF THEM UNTIL LATE LAST NIGHT. OUR GENERAL CONCERNS AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT IS THAT IS A BROAD OVERREACH IN THE SCOPE EXPANSION OF PHARMACISTS POTENTIALLY ENCROACHING ON PRIMARY CARE AND ONCOLOGY. ALLOWING PHARMACISTS TO ORDER ADMINISTER AND INTERPRET CLIA WAIVED TESTS WITHIN NARROW EXCLUSION SEAMY TAKES ISSUE WITH THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE SETTING IN PROTECTION WHEN IT COMES TO CERTAIN SAMPLES. WE FEEL AS THOUGH THE PHARMACY IS NOT INAPPROPRIATE PLEASE BE COLLECTING AND TESTING VAGINAL SWABS SIEMENS VESTMENTS FOR PERFORMING VENIPUNCTURE. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT AS AMENDED READS SPECIMEN COLLECTION MAY BE DONE ONSITE ASSESSMENT COLLECTION IS DONE ON SITE IT MAY IT BE PERFORMED BY THE PATIENT. AND GIVEN A DEDICATED SPACE THAT PROVIDES FOR PRIVACY DURING SPECIMEN COLLECTION. MAY ALLOW IS THAT A PHARMACIST MAY BE COLLECTING THE SPECIMENS. WERE FAMOUSLY OPPOSED TO VAGINAL SWABS OF SEMEN SPECIMENS BEING COLLECTED BY PHARMACISTS AND OR IN PHARMACIES. FURTHERMORE WE TAKE GREAT ACTION ISSUE BUT THE MATTER OF INTERPRETATION. DESPITE HIS HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS SIMPLE TO ADMINISTER IT IS OUR POSITION THAT WHEN ANY HEALTHCARE IN ANY HEALTHCARE SETTING WITH A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL. PATIENTS HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISEASE OR CONDITION BEING TESTED THAN THEY WOULD IN THEIR OWN HOME. WE DO NOT BELIEVE PHARMACISTS HAVE SUFFICIENT EDUCATION TRAINING AND THE DISEASES AND CONDITIONS THAT THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED CLIA WAIVED TESTS ADDRESS WHICH PRECLUDES THEM FROM PROVIDING ACCURATE INFORMATION ON RESULTS AND ENSURING. PROPER REFERRAL AND FOLLOW UP CARE. LASTLY BEEN LISTING TO BE ALLOWS FOR EXPANSION OF THE PATIENT ASSESSMENT PHARMACISTS WOULD BE A LOT PERFORM. EXAMPLES GIVEN BY SPONSOR OF THESE ASSESSMENTS INCLUDE BONE DENSITY AND DEPRESSION AMONG OTHERS. C. MADE FRIENDS AT WILDLY. INAPPROPRIATE FOR PHARMACISTS TO BE PERFORMING SUCH COMPLEX TESTS AND THOSE WITH WIDE RANGING MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF ASSESSING THESE THINGS SHOULD BE LEFT TO PHYSICIANS TRAINED IN THESE CONDITIONS IN THESE CONDITIONS. FORTUNATELY AS BEFORE NINE SPONSORED BY THE BOARD OF PHARMACY IS CURRENTLY IN THE ASSEMBLY AND HAS RECEIVED SIGN OFF FROM SEVERAL THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL. AS IT PRUDENTLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUES THIS LEGISLATION PRESENTS ITSELF. FOR THESE REASONS AS WE OPPOSE THE OVER REACHING EIGHTY THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT BEFORE US TODAY WE ASKED TO CONSIDER ASKING FOR A NINE. AS A SAFER ALTERNATIVE ROUTE WHEN IT RETURNS THIS HOUSE. THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE MISTRETTA. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS DEMAND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RHEUMATOLOGY ALLIANCE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY PLASTIC SURGEONS IN CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY WE ARE OPPOSED AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT SPECIFICALLY TO THE LANGUAGE MOST EXPANSIVE SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR PHARMACISTS TO PERFORM PATIENT ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES AND HEALTH SCREENINGS WE RECOGNIZE THESE ACTIVITIES WOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED FOR PHARMACISTS IN CERTAIN SETTINGS WITHOUT ANY DEFINITION OF WHAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN PATIENT ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES AND HEALTH SCREENINGS WE ARE VERY CONCERNED. THIS WILL RESULT IN A PHARMACIST PERFORMING PROCEDURES BEYOND THEIR TRAINING AND EDUCATION I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS- SCOPE IS SO DEFINED TO ALLOW THEM TO PERFORM ANY PATIENT ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE OR HEALTH SCREENINGS WITHOUT ANY DEFINITION OF WHAT THAT OF WHAT THIS INCLUDES OR WHAT TRAINING EDUCATION IS NEEDED TO. PROVIDE THERE'S BEEN NO DISCUSSION OR EVALUATION ON WHETHER PHARMACIST RECEIVES ADEQUATE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO PERFORM THESE PROCEDURES. THERE'S BEEN NO DISCUSSION OF THE TRAINING IS CONSISTENT FROM ONE PHARMACY SCHOOL TO THE NEXT. THE ONLY REQUIREMENTS FOR FIRMS TO PERFORM THESE PROCEDURES IS A COMPLETE A RESIDENCY PROGRAM OR- THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED EXPERIENCE IN PATIENTS. AND DIRECT PATIENT CARE. THESE REQUIREMENTS AND NO WAY INSURE THE PHARMACIST IS QUALIFIED TO BE DOING THESE PROCEDURES EVEN IF THEY ARE IN A SETTING WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NOTE OF. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY. SIR PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF BRENT SPENCER ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBGYN STRYCHNINE WE'RE NOT POSITION FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR ANY OTHER OPPOSITION WITNESSES. HERE IN THE GALLERY SEEING NONE LET'S MOVE TO ROOM ONE TWELVE WITNESSES WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THREE TWO EIGHT.

VISITOR NUMBERS PRODUCT NUMBER AVE THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGIST IN OPPOSITION TO EITHER P. TWENTY. THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. AND AS A REMINDER PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. TO THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT. AND MISTER KERR NOBODY ELSE'S QUEUING UP THANK YOU MR MODERATOR LET'S NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE CHAMBER. COLLINGS ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS REGARDING THIS MEASURE- CENTER LABEL FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I JUST- I APPRECIATE WHAT THE OTHERS TRYING TO DO BUT AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTED PHARMACISTS FOR MANY YEARS THEY ARE UNDERSTAFFED AND OVERWORKED AND I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THEY WILL ACTUALLY HAVE THE THEY'RE SMART ENOUGH FOR SURE. BUT I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THEY WILL HAVE THE CAPABILITY OR THE CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY DO ALL OF THESE ADDITIONAL TESTS SO I LOVE MY PHARMACIST I THINK THAT SHE IS AMAZING AND KNOWS SO MUCH. BUT HAVING THEM DO THESE ADDITIONAL TESTS AND WE KNOW THAT MANY COMPANIES WILL NOT PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL HOURS FOR THEM THEY WON'T PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PHARMACISTS I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT WE'RE GOING TO STRETCH A STRETCH THESE FOLKS WHO ALREADY DOING. A YEOMAN'S JOB- RESTRICTION ME THE THINNER SO I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY AND HOPE THAT WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE KNOW THAT THESE PHARMACISTS ARE GOING TO HAVE THE HELP THEY NEED TO DO THIS. AND I DO HAVE SOME MILDER CONCERNS ABOUT THE VAGINAL SWABBING AND THE- THE SEMEN TESTS BUT MOSTLY I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE PHARMACIST. THANK YOU SIR LOUIS SENTIMENT. I HAD A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR- SO WE PASSED SB FOUR OH NINE BY SENATOR CAFIERO EARLIER THIS YEAR. IN THAT HAD A MORE LIMITED EXPANSION OF TESTING. AND I GUESS I WAS JUST CURIOUS- YOU KNOW I CAN SEE THE VALUE OF HAVING IN YOUR PHARMACY BEING ABLE TO GETALL THESE SORTS OF TESTS- I COULD ALSO SEE CONCERNS AROUND LIABILITY IN SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY. SOME OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- INSIDE I GUESS YOU KNOW THE ARGUMENT THAT'S IN MY HEAD IS THAT. THE BEST BEFORE- NINE TAKES A MORE MEASURED APPROACH AND I GUESS I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY- WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ARGUMENT FOR WHY WE SHOULD GO WHOLE HOG HERE IN AN OPEN UP- HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS I THINK OF MORE TESTS. ARE THEY CAN BE FOR PERFORM THE PHARMACIES THANK YOU- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SP FOUR OH NINE ACTUALLY WHEN YOU VOTED ON IT DID NOT HAVE- THE- THE SAME BILL ENACTED THAT BILL WAS CHANGE ONCE IT MOVED OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY AND I THINK- THE REAL BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. SP FOUR OH NINE AND MY BILL IS THAT- WE SHOULD SHE BASICALLY HAS AN OFTEN AND THIS IS AN AN OPT OUT. BUT THE IDEA IN BOTH OF THE BILLS IS ACTUALLY TO EXPAND ESPECIALLY INTO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THESE CLEAR WAYS WE HAVE WAIVED TESTS THESE ARE TESTS THAT. AGAIN ARE- DEFINED BY THE FDA IS SIMPLE TASKS WITH. VERY LOW RISK FOR AN INCORRECT RESULT. AND I'M JUST TO ANSWER THE CONCERN FROM SENATOR LEYVA- THE- PHARMACISTS ALL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK TO ACTUALLY OFTEN TO- TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS TESTING SO REAL WE REALLY WOULD SEE THAT THIS IS MORE. INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE DOING THIS THAT ARE IN UNDERSERVED AREAS WHERE PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE AND AS- EASIER CONNECTION TO A PHYSICIAN. SO WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE PHARMACISTS HAVE BEEN FIT WORKING VERY HARD DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T EXPECT THEM TO TAKE THIS ON UNLESS THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE- THE CAPACITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES IN THE FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. SEEING NONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I'D JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IPHONE.

FINE LET'S NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CHAMBER CALLINGS ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. SENATOR BOOKER. I THINK WE WE'VE HEARD STRONGLY FROM THE DA ROSE AND I ALSO HEARD FROM MY COUNTY MANAGER CEMETERY COUNTY MY KALECKI WHO WAS THIS VERY SKEPTICAL C. MTZ CMT CNN HAS NOW THAT WAS PUT ON THE BOARD FOR EIGHT YEARS HE'S A FORMER POLICE CHIEF AND HE SPEAKS BOTH OF THEM I'M INCREDIBLY STRONGLY ABOUTTHEIR EFFORTS TO CUT DOWN ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND CERTAINLY THERE'S THE CONCERNS ON BOTH THEIR PARTS THAT. WITHOUT SEEM TO SEE. TIME WITHOUT A LONGER WE AUTHORIZATION THAT WE COULD TAKE A STEP BACK AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING SO. THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND IS SOMETHING I WILL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING AT. AS WE MAKE THIS DECISION GOING FORWARD ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH HIM TO SEE VERSUS. MOVING TO A LICENSURE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IS CAN WE CONSIDER SOMETHING SAY TWO YEARS BECAUSE THIS ARGUMENT THAT. CERTIFICATES FOR TWO YEARS AND THAT WE CAN. THEN EXTEND. A MAN IS CONCERNED THAT ONE YEAR THEN MAKES THE- CAN EXISTING REGIME LESS EFFECTIVE- AND THE IF THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE WE MAY ASK YOU BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE- I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ONE YEAR IS JUST AN EXTENSION SO WE HAVE WORK TO DO- AND CERTAINLY WILL BE MY PRIORITY DURING THAT YEAR TO A FIGURE OUT OF TIME IF WE CAN MAINTAIN THE CURRENT EFFORTS COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH AGAIN I HEAR FROM MY FOLKS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE SO I JUST ADD ANY COMMENTS ON ANY OF THAT. HELLO YES THE CHAIR IF I MIGHT- THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER AS YOU RECALL FROM OUR SONS AT HEARINGS. WHICH WE HAD A FULL AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION. ON SOME OF THE ISSUES TO BE IRONED OUT DUE TO THE CORPORATE PANDEMIC. WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD A FULL BREADTH OF. EXPERIENCE DIVING INTO THESE ISSUES AND IRON OUT THESE ISSUES WE ALSO. AS YOU WELL KNOW. AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS AND WORKING WITH THE CHAIR HERE IN THE SENATE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THERE'S CONSISTENCY. IN BOTH HOUSES AND WE WISH AND DESIRE TO HAVE MORE TIME TO I KNOW SOME OF THESE ISSUES WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU. A NO VOTE TODAY WOULD ELIMINATE THE BOARD- ELIMINATE THAT COUNTS I SHOULD SAY EXCUSE ME. TO JUST BE VERY CLEAR. A NO VOTE TODAY WOULD. ELIMINATE THE COUNCIL WHICH WOULD THEN GIVE. ARGUMENTS TO THAT OF A POTENTIAL SUNRISE AND CREATION OF A NEW ENTITY SO- I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR TO. HELP ENSURE THAT WE CLEAR THAT UP WITH ADVOCATES AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO ENSURE. WHAT ARE YES AND NO VOTE SIGNIFIES TODAY. JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE- DONE ABOUT FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN BOARDS AND BUREAUS IN THE SUNSET REVIEW PERIOD OF MY NUMBER IS CORRECT BECAUSE OF THE COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THE IMPACT ON THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY IN OUR LEGISLATIVE SESSION IN THE RESTRICTED NUMBER OF HEARINGS THAT WE COULD CONDUCT OVER THE LAST OF FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS. OF THE ISSUE HERE HAS TO DO WITH WHETHER TO ALLOW THE COUNCIL TO CONTINUE. IT'S A VERY VERY GOOD WORK OR WHETHER THERE IS ANY BENEFIT TO BE DERIVED FROM ESTABLISHING YET ANOTHER. BORDER BUREAU TO HANDLE THIS THERE THE- UNDOUBTEDLY WILL BE A LIVELY CONVERSATION WHEN WE GET TO THAT WE DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO. ENGAGE FULLY IN THAT CONVERSATION THIS YEAR UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE SCHEDULE AND THE OTHER ISSUE FRANKLY. IS THE COST TO THE LICENSEES OF ESTABLISHING ANOTHER BORDER BUREAU TO HANDLE THIS BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW. THESE ARE SPECIAL FUND FUNDED BOARDS AND BUREAUS WHICH MEANS THE PEOPLE THAT WE CHOOSE TO REGULATE ARE FORCED TO PAY THE FEES TO OPERATE THE BOARDS AND BUREAUS. SO AS I'VE COMMUNICATED TO- CHAIR LOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE DO A RATHER DETAILED FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS AND WE PASS THAT INFORMATION ON. TO THOSE LICENSEES WHO SEEM VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING A STATE BORDER BUREAU- AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENT THERE'S NO. INTENT TO END- THIS. ORGANIZATION ONE FORM OR ANOTHER THAT'S CONTRIBUTED SO MIGHTILY TO THE ISSUES THAT ARE OF INTEREST TO THE THOSE OF YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT TO- TO SORT OF SUPPLEMENT WHAT SURE LOVE SAID WITH REGARD TO THIS MEASURE. CENTER BECKER. A CLARIFICATION AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING TO THE OPPOSITION AS WELL TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT. IF WE VOTE YES ON THIS TODAY DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GETTING RID OF C. M. T. C. AND AGAIN JUST PICKING FOR MYSELF FOR SO I SHOULD SAY. I AM I MET PERSONALLY A HUGE BELIEVER MASSAGE THERAPY HAVE BENEFITED FOR TREMENDOUSLY SO I'VE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR. THE FOLKS ARE PRACTICING A MASSAGE THERAPY AND- BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOU GET IF WE DO VOTE YES THAT IN THIS YEAR- WE'LL BE LOOKING TO. OUT ALSO AND LOOKING TO- MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. THAT WE EITHER WE CONTINUE IT OR WE CERTAINLY LOOK AT THE BENEFITS THAT THE WORK THE CMT C. IS BEEN DOING ON THE ON THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING FRAUD. AND MAKE SURE WE DON'T TAKE TWO STEPS BACKWARD THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SIR. SATURDAY YES- I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM US SENATOR BACKER.

I THANK YOU AND I WANT TO CONCUR WITH MY GOOD FRIEND FROM NOW ON NOT THE LEADERSHIP THAT OUR OUR CHEERS OF THE BNP AWESOME REMEMBER LOW AND NOW SENATOR ROTH- DOWN THE TIGHT SCHEDULE WE HAD THIS YEAR I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT- I THINK THAT THE COMMENTS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT OR VERY VERY COMPELLING IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO INTERACT. WITH THE COUNCIL AND SOMETIMES THE BUREAUCRACY CAN BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO GETTING THAT KIND OF INTERACTION THAT KIND OF WORK IN INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES SO I HOPE THAT THE BULLS FORWARD NEXT YEAR I'LL TAKE A- DEEPER DIVE INTO A CLOSE LOOK AT THAT AND HEAR MORE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT.

TO THE BOARD OF PHARMACY WHICH ALLOWS FOR THEM TO LEVY SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES ON PHARMACIES THAT ARE UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP OR MANAGEMENT. THE BILL PROPOSES TO INCREASE THOSE FINES UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS CURRENTLY PHARMACIES CAN RECEIVE UP TO ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A VIOLATION. WELL THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS AS IT KNOWLEDGE TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE RIGHT TO CURE A CERTAIN CRITERIA FOR THE ASSESSMENT FOR THE BOARD- PRIOR TO ISSUING THE PENALTIES WHICH WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. WE STILL BELIEVE THE AMOUNTS OF THE EXTREME OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE FAR TOO SEVERE. A RETAIL FOR RETAIL PHARMACIES PROFIT MARGINS ARE ACTUALLY VERY LOW ON AVERAGE PHARMACIES HAVE LESS THAN A 2% PROFIT MARGIN NATIONWIDE. SOME OF OUR PHARMACIES ACTUALLY IN CALIFORNIA AND LOST REVENUE IN TWENTY TWENTY. WE DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER STATE WHOSE BOARD OF PHARMACY WILL BE GRANTS HAS THIS AUTHORITY OR IS WILL BE GRANTED THIS AUTHORITY. NOR ANY OTHER STATE THAT COMES CLOSE TO THESE TYPES OF FINE LEVELS. WE DO HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF PHARMACY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US ON THE SENSIBILITY TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AGAIN WHAT WE DO APPRECIATE THE TIME SPENT ON THESE AMENDMENTS- IN THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE. WE MUST STILL POSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE GALLERY. SEEING NONE LET'S ROOM THAT'S MOVED TO ROOM ONE TWELVE. TO SEE IF THERE ANY WITNESSES WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE THERE THERE ARE NONE LET'S MOVE TO THE TELECONFERENCE SERVICE.

AND WE HAVE NO PARTICIPANTS QUEUING UP. THANK YOU MR MODERATOR LET'S MOVE BACK TO THE CHAMBERS TO MY COLLEAGUE'S QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS STARTING WITH SENATOR DODD. MISTER CHAIR I I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE- A COUPLE POINTS THE BILL TO THE AUTHOR IF THAT'S OKAY. PLEASE PROCEED SO- THE FIRST SPEAKER BROUGHT OUT THAT THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT- THE PHARMACIES WERE DOING AND I THINK IT WAS CONSULTATION OR NOT DOING THE PROPRIOCEPTIVE TATIAN. BUT IT WAS KIND OF GARBLED SO I DIDN'T REALLY GET THAT VERY CLEAR SO COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IS WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF BEHAVIORS THAT ARE HAPPENING. THAT WERE TRYING TO. STOP THOSE BEHAVIORS AND WERE USING THESE FIGHTS AS A MORE- PERHAPS APPROPRIATE WAY OF DEALING WITH THEM AND GETTING. YOU KNOW GETTING COMPLIANCE AND THEN SECOND. I IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT WE GO FROM FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IT WAS GONNA BE A MILLION SO I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. BUT IT STILL SEEMS TO ME THAT FROM 500-022-0050 THOUSAND- IS EXCESSIVE SO I WONDER IF- ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOVE YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE COMMENTS PLEASE. YES TO THE CHAIR IF I IF I MIGHT ON THE ON THE ISSUE SPECIFICALLY ON THE FINES. AS YOU KNOW THAT. MANY CALIFORNIANS GET MANY OF THE DAY- SEPT MUCH OF THE SUPPORT FROM SMALL TO SMALL INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES VERSUS THAT OF RETAIL CHAINS AS WELL. AND A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR A FIVE THOUSAND FINE APPLIES TO BOTH THE INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES AS WELL AS THE MAJOR CHAINS AS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S PARITY TO ENSURE THAT THIS THAT BEFORE SMITH'S. MECHANISM TOWARDS THAT ALSO IT WAS A REFERENCE ABOUT THIS FINDING UNPRECEDENTED. AS MEMBERS WILL KNOW UNDER THIS COMMITTEE AT THE ERROR OF JURISDICTION DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS THE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY CAN BRING UP. TO A MILLION DOLLARS IN FINES SPECIFICALLY SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT OF THE COMPARISONS WE KNOW THAT THAT'S ALREADY IN EXISTENCE. BUT PERHAPS ALSO THE WITNESS FROM A U. S. E. W. CAN ALSO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE VIOLATIONS OF EXPERIENCES THERE FRONT AND CENTER. SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO HEAR FROM THE. C. W. WITNESS IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE COULD YOU ADDRESS MR CENTER DUDS QUESTION. YEAH HAPPY TAIL ACCENTOR GUARD. MY COMMENT. THE. EIGHTY THOUSAND ELEVEN FINE- AROUND. LAST COMPLICATIONS FROM MEDICATION- WE RECENTLY PASSED A BILL AT THE FOURTEEN FORTY TWO BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND GOT A BOARD OF PHARMACY REGULATIONS IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT BILL IF YOU GET IT OUT THE PARK STAFF DEPARTMENT THAT YOU ARE WORKING BY THEMSELVES GETTING ALL THEIR LIFE. MY COMPUTER USER PHARMACY TECHNICIAN DUTIES AS WELL AS NON LIFE AND BEAUTY LIKE RINGING UP GROCERIES OR ON HELPING PATIENTS FIND OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINE AND- THAT THEY'LL CONTINUE TO GO UNENFORCED PHARMACISTS ARE CONTINUING TO WORK. BY THEMSELVES WITHOUT THE ADEQUATE BUT AT HALF THE PART THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL OF THEIR DUTIES- PROTECT PATIENT TIME AND SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE SAYING I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO FURTHER ISSUES AROUND PATIENT HUNTING CONTACT THAT.

AB TWELVE SEVENTY EIGHT REQUIRES THIS TO BE DONE THREE DIFFERENT WAYS ONE TO PROVIDE A WRITTEN NOTICE THAT THE PATIENTMUST SIGN. HOPEFULLY THE SIGNATURE WILL GET MORE PEOPLE TO READ THE FORM. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE WAITING ROOM AND IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE DONE BY THE PHYSICIAN OR SURGEON DURING VISIT. TO POSTED IN A LOCATION IN AN AREA THAT IS LIKELY TO BE SEEN BY ALL PERSONS WHO ENTERED THE OFFICE. THREE POST THE OPEN PAYMENTS DATABASE NOTICE ON THE INTERNET WEBSITE USED TO PUT THE PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS PRACTICE. WHY THREE DIFFERENT WAYS OF NOTIFICATION THE SAME REASON PEPSI AND COKE USE TV RADIO PRINT AND THE INTERNET SIMPLY BECAUSE- PEOPLE PROCESS INFORMATION DIFFERENTLY. SOME MAY SEE THE POST A NOTICE IN THE LOBBY OTHERS MAY NOT. SOME MAY SEE IT ONLINE OTHERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. AND THERE'S ALSO DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND HOW EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP APPROACHES INFORMATION. WHAT IS THE OPEN PAYMENTS DATABASE AND WHY ALL THE FUSS. THE DATABASE IS AN EASY TO USE FEDERAL WEBSITE WHICH LISTS FINANCIAL EXCHANGES BETWEEN DRUG AND DEVICE MANUFACTURERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TYPE IN YOUR DOCTOR'S NAME AND YOU CAN SEE IF THEY'VE RECEIVED COMPENSATION FOR RESEARCH INDUSTRY SPONSORED EDUCATION. OR FREE LUNCH. THE PROBLEM I'M TRYING TO SOLVE IS THAT NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT. THE SOLUTION IS TO NOTIFY PATIENTS OF THE DATABASE AND WE NEED TO DO THAT REPETITIVELY SO IT STICKS. WHILE ACCEPTING THESE PAYMENTS DO NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE INTO A CONFLICT OF INTEREST THE DATABASE PROVIDES THE PATIENT WITH INFORMATION THAT MAY HELP THEM MAKE BETTER INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE. IN THE CASE OF MY CONSTITUENT WINDY CONNECT WHO UNDERWENT BREAST RECONSTRUCTION IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FOLLOWING A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY SHE OPTED FOR SURGERIES AFTER TESTING REVEALED THAT SHE- HAD THE BRCA GENE WHICH MADE HER SUSCEPTIBLE TO BREAST CANCER. NOW MY CONSTITUENT IS LIVING WITH CHRONIC PAIN AFTER EXPERIENCING SEVERE COMPLICATIONS FOLLOWING HER SURGERY. SHE LEARNED THAT HER PHYSICIAN HAD RECEIVED MORE HAN FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD FROM THE MANUFACTURER OF THE DEVICE USED IN HER SURGERY. THIS INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE ON THE FEDERAL DATABASE BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ITS EXISTENCE. SHE LEARNED SHE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE DEVICE ITSELF WAS EXPERIMENTAL FOR BREAST RECONSTRUCTION AND HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA. BY THE WAY COLLEAGUES. MY CONSTITUENTS HUSBAND IS A DOCTOR HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS WEBSITE. AND WINDY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SHE MAY HAVE ASKED MORE QUESTIONS AND MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE REACHED OUT. FOR A SECOND OPINION. FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PHYSICIANS AND MEDICAL PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS ARE COMMON. AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT ALL BAD HOWEVER THEYCAN ALSO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND IN SOME CASES CAN BE LEARNED A LOT BLUR THE LINES BETWEEN PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES AND THE CONDUCT OF MEDICAL RESEARCH TRAINING AND PRACTICE. A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ANALYSIS BY PROPUBLICA FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE DOCTORS WHO RECEIVED PAYMENTS PRESCRIBED 50% MORE OF THAT DRUG THE DOCTORS WHO DID NOT NOW I CAN ALSO DEBATE THAT POINT AND I CAN TELL YOU. THAT MAYBE FOR MOST DOCTORS THAT PRODUCT IS THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET. AND THAT IT HAPPENS TO COINCIDE ALSO WITH A GREATER AMOUNT OF MARKETING BUT NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND SO I CAN SEE THAT AS WELL. A SEPARATE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE RECEIPT OF INDUSTRY SPONSORED MEALS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RATE OF PRESCRIBING THE PROMOTED BRAND NAME MEDICATION RELATIVE TO ALTERNATIVES WITHIN THE DRUG CLASS. RECENT OPPOSITION STATES THERE IS NO NEED FOR THIS BILL. LET THE FEDERAL OPEN PAYMENTS WEBSITE ALREADY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF DISCLOSURE I AGREE. I AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION. THERE IS A DISCLOSURE IN PLACE HOWEVER. WHAT THEY FAIL TO MENTION IS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS TOOL THAT IT EVEN EXISTS AGAIN ALL TWELVE SEVENTY DOES. IT AT THE LOCAL STATE LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY TO THIS TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING DOCTORS TO SIMPLY DISCLOSE WHERE TO ACCESS THE FEDERAL DATABASE. BY DOING THIS WE ENSURE THAT THIS NECESSARY INFORMATION GETS TO ITS INTENDED AUDIENCE THE PATIENT. ALLOWS THE PATIENT ALLOWS PHYSICIANS TO PROVIDE CONTEXT TO THE RECOMMENDATION RECOMMENDED CARE. DRUG AND DEVICE MANUFACTURERS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THESE PAYMENTS AND THIS GREAT WEBSITE MAKES IT SO EASY FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE THE DATA. BUT THE ONUS REMAINS ON US THE CONSUMER TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND TO SEE GET OUT MY BILL BILL IS DESIGNED TO NOT BE PUNITIVE RATHER IT IS WRITTEN TO EMPOWER PATIENTS TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE. I HOPE IT WILL CREATE A STRONGER PATIENT DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP THROUGH GREATER TRANSPARENCY I'M JOINED BY MY CONSTITUENTS WHEN THE CONNECT WHO IS HAD TO HAVE SIX SURGERIES AFTER THE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND STILL LIVES WITH PAIN. AND ALSO BY DR CHARLES ROSEN PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF MEDICAL ETHICS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER WE WILL MOVE ON TO TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL. LET ME- REMIND THOSE WHO WERE GOING TO BE TESTIFYING BOTH AS LEADS AND SUPPORT AND LEAVES AN OPPOSITION- I RECOGNIZE THIS IS A SENSITIVE TOPIC ON BOTH SIDES SO I BUT I WOULD ASK THAT YOU TRY TO. LIMIT YOUR TESTIMONY TO THE THREE MINUTES THAT ARE CONTAINED IN OUR- COMMITTEE COMMITTEE RULES SO LET'S PROCEED WITH- DOCTOR ROSEN. AND MS CONNECT WITNESSES YOU MAY PROCEED. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME PERFECTLY. OKAY HI MY NAME IS WENDY CONNECT MY STORY IS ONE OF CHRONIC PAIN DEFORMITY AND NUMEROUS CORRECTIVE SURGERY HI MY DEVICE THAT EXPLODED INSIDE ME THE DEVICE MY SURGEON HAD BEEN PAID ALMOST HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TWO RESEARCH AND PROMOTE. BUT HE NEVER TOLD US ABOUT THE MONEY MY STORY COULD BE YOUR STORY I AM AN INFORMED CONSUMER MY HUSBAND IS A PHYSICIAN BUT EVEN THOUGH WE HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THE OPEN PAYMENTS WEBSITE WE DO NOT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION AND WE HAD NO JUST REASON TO DISTRACT MY THIRTEEN. KNOWING ABOUT OPEN PAYMENT WOULD HAVE SAVED ME. YEARS OF PAIN AND DEFORMITY. I HAVE DONE EVERY I WOULD ASK THE RIGHT. AND I WOULD HAVE WANTED TO KNOW MORE IN IN A MILLION YEARS I NEVER WOULD HAVE CONSENTED. TO HAVING THAT DEVICE IMPLANTED INSIDE ME. I'VE BEEN THINKING TOO MANY DOCTORS THE LAST FEW MONTHS. MOST ETHICAL DOCTORS DISCLOSED POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THESE DOCTORS KNOW THAT PATIENTS TRUSTED DOCTOR MORE IT JUST CLOSES. ESPECIALLY THOSE STOCKS INVOLVED IN INNOVATIONS. AND RESEARCH PATIENT BLOOD. AGENTS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE OPEN PAYMENTS. INTENDED REACH TO INFORM PATIENTS WOULD NEVER ACHIEVED THAT DOCTORS ARE NOT AFRAID OF TRANSPARENCY THEY HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE. EIGHT ONE TWO SEVEN EIGHT IS ABOUT PROTECTING PATIENTS LIKE ME YOU AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS I AM HELPING THEM TO HAVE ALL THE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH. IF YOU AND I HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT AB ONE TWO SEVEN EIGHT THANK YOU MA'AM DR ROSEN. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME PERFECTLY. MY NAME IS ROSE ROSE INCREDIBLE PROFESSOR OF ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY AT THE UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN FOR THIRTY YEARS. AS WELL AS PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR MEDICAL ETHICS I WORK WITH SENATORS GRASSLEY AND CALLED SPONSORING THE PHYSICIAN PAYMENT SUNSHINE ACT FOR WHICH I TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST TERM. THE ACT THAT REQUIRES ALL MEDICAL COMPANIES REPORT TO THE CENTER FOR MEDICARE THE DOCTORS JIM THEY'RE PAYING MONEY OR THE LIKE. AND HOW MUCH. PART OF LEGALLY. IN ORGANS ADULT PATIENTS HAVE A TO KNOW. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT. INDUSTRY VIGOROUSLY RESISTED THE SMART ANIMAL RESEARCH AND MEDICAL PRACTICE WITH YOUR INDEPENDENT WITHOUT FINANCIAL FINANCIAL BY. WHEN IT INVOLVES PATIENTS BODIES AND THEIR LIVES AND HOW THEY DARN WELL HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THIS IS ANGELA THIS. TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR EIGHTY TWELVE SEVENTY EIGHT ONLY HAVE PATIENTS RECEIVE A PIECE OF PAPER THAT GIVE THEM THE ADDRESS OF THE DATABASE AND POSTED ON THE WALL ALL TE OTHER NOTICES AND ON THE DOCTOR'S WEBSITE. THAT IS ALL NOTHING MORE I AM A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN AND THIS WOULD NOT BURDENSOME. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REQUIREMENT FOR THE POSITION TO VERBALLY NORM BRADY DISCLOSE ANY COMPANIES OR REIMBURSEMENT. NAMELY NOTHING INTERFERES WITH THE BUSINESS. VOTING FOR THIS BILL IS A VOTE FOR TRANSPARENCY AND HAITIAN HERE. MAKE NO MISTAKE THE VOTE AGAINST IT IN BOTH CHRISTY CHRISTY AND HER INDUSTRY PROFIT OVER PATIENT CARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR NOW LET'S TURN TO ANY SUPPORT WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY.

IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE SEVENTY EIGHT. ALTHOUGH WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S ATTEMPT AT IMPROVING THIS BILL IT CONTINUES TO CREATE AN ENORMOUS ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FOR ALL POSITIONS DESPITE WHETHER THEY THEMSELVES EVEN EXIST ON THE OPEN PAYMENTS DATABASE. CMA IS FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE DISCLOSURE OF THE OPEN PAYMENTS WEBSITE AND DATABASE AND THEY'RE IN. AS SUCH WE SUPPORT A FULLY INFORMED HE IS A PATIENT POPULATION AS SUCH WE FELT IT WOULD BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO POST A VISUAL NOTIFICATION CONSPICUOUSLY IN EVERY OFFICE LOBBY IN ADDITION TO REQUIRING EVERY PATIENT SIGN A WRITTEN DISCLOSURE AT INITIAL PATIENT INTAKE. THIS COMPROMISE EFFICIENTLY INFORMS THE PATIENT IS THE AUTHOR'S INTENT WITHOUT PLACING AN ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON PHYSICIANS. ANNUAL DISCLOSURE WHICH THIS BILL REQUIRES SPENDING OUT THERE HAS CONVENIENTLY FAILED TO MENTION WOULD INEVITABLY CREATE. EMAILS BEEN WILLING TO MAKE THIS COMPROMISE SINCE EARLY CONVERSATION SHORTLY AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL AND WE HAVE NOT WAVERED.

THERE ARE NO FURTHER LINES IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME OKAY LET'S BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CHAMBER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. SENATOR PAN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR BECKER SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU TEAR OFF AND- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR OUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BILL APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT HE TOOK- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY DON'T OPPOSE THE IDEA OF NOTIFICATION I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT PATHS- FOR- INFORMING PEOPLE ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE DATABASE I DO HAVE TO SAY I WAS AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE DATABASE- IN MY PRACTICE BUT- I GUESS THE QUESTION THE CONCERN I HAVE THOUGH IS THAT- AND- WOULD BE IS- SERVED IN. RECORDKEEPING BURDEN SO FOR THE PRACTICE SO- SO THE ISSUE WOULD BE IS THAT IT WHAT KIND OF DOCUMENTATION DOES THE PRACTICE ITSELF WOULD HAVE TO MAINTAIN TO SHOW THAT IT DID THESE THINGS SO YOUNG WE HAVE A FIXED THING ON THE WALL WE HAVE THE WEBSITE. AND THEN THE- SIGNED STATEMENTS- THAT YOU'RE ASKING THE PASTEL BOTH INITIALLY AND ANNUALLY. BUT IS THE PRACTICE GOING TO HAVE TO THEN BE REQUIRED TO SIMPLY KEEP A FILING CABINET FULL OF. YOU KNOW COPIES OF THESE NOW THE BASICALLY STATEMENT- WITH SIGNATURES- SO WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD OF SOMEONE ELSE COMES BY TO SHOW THAT THEY ACTUALLY GAVE IT IN THE LAST YEAR. OR WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO- BE WILLING TO TAKE SOME LANGUAGE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU. HAVE TO GIVE THE STATEMENT- BUT- YOU DON'T NEED TO KEEP A- A- BASICALLY COPY OF EACH ONE FOR EVERY SINGLE PATIENT SO THAT- THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY SHOW THAT THIS IS WHAT WE NORMALLY DO IN OUR OFFICE. THAT WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE. A FILING CABINETS FULL OF BASICALLY PIECES OF PAPER OR REPROGRAM EHRS. AS EVIDENCE OF- THE FILLING THAT PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS SO AGAIN REDUCING THE COSTS THE OVERHEAD OF BURDEN OF. MAINTENANCE AND STILL ACHIEVING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AIMS THAT YOU'RE CHEATING WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE GET NOTICED AND THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT WAYS PEOPLE WOULD GET THE NOTIFICATION. OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE DATABASE. REMEMBER HAPPY TO RESPOND I RESEARCH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO RESPOND TO EVERYTHING AS WE GO OR ALL AT ONCE HAPPY TO RESPOND BECAUSE I SUSPECT A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS ARE GOING TO BE SIMILAR SIMILARLY ORIENTED BUT- I'M HAPPY TO GO ONE BY ONE. WELL I. WILL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU EXCEPT THE- SENATOR PAN MAY HAVE ASK QUESTIONS THAT OTHERS MAY ASK IN YOUR RESPONSE TO HIM MAY ADDRESS OTHERS CONCERNED HAPPY TO HAPPY TO SO. AT JUST TO BE CLEAR ON THE DOCUMENTATION SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. JUST THE SHEER NUMBER AND VOLUME OF PAPERS. RIGHT BEING COLLECTED OKAY- YEP HEALTH CARE AND DATA COLLECTION HAS COME A LONG WAY WE DO HAVE A COLLECTION OF DATA YOU DATABASE WE DO HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW. FOR SUCH REDUNDANT MEASURES TO BE DONE RELATIVELY QUICKLY AND- ALSO FOR A GOOD RECORD KEEPING SO THAT IT DOESN'T CREATED MINISTER OF BURDENS I'M VERY SENSITIVE ESPECIALLY TO MEDICAL CLINICS AND OFFICES IN RURAL AREAS THAT MAY NOT HAVE. THE PHYSICIANS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS LET ALONE ALSO THE ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS THAT WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS I DID PUT SOME THOUGHT INTO THIS ALONG WITH WITH THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE IT EASY- IF YOU KNOW. I THINK AS THESE THE BILL OFFERS A BY THE WAY THERE'S ALSO JUST YOU YOU DID MENTION ANNUAL SO I WANT TO ADDRESS THAT AND THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR CMA SAID THAT I FAILED TO LET THIS BODY NO I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER FAIL TO LET ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING SO I WANT TO CORRECT THAT WORDING- THIS BILL. ASKS FOUR EIGHT ANNUAL- UPDATING OF THE INFORMATION BECAUSE DOCTOR PEN THE GOAL IS REPETITION IF WE KEEP ON REPEATING SOMETHING SEVERAL TIMES A STUDY SUGGESTS YOU REPEAT SOMETHING SEVEN TIMES IT'LL STICK WITH SOMEONE RIGHT THE IDEA IS TO REPEAT THIS SO THAT PEOPLE SEE IT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT A YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC THAT DOESN'T GO TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE BUT FOR MAYBE ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS. THEY'RE NOT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO THEN GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAIL THE DOCUMENT TO THAT PERSON'S HOME REQUIRING THEM TO SEND IT BACK TO THEM THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THIS JUST SAYS THE NEXT TIME YOU HAPPEN TO GO TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE YOU CAN FILL OUT THAT SIGNED THIS DOCUMENT WE MADE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THE DOCTORS OFFICES NOT BURDENED SO IT'S I JUST WANT TO CORRECT THAT. AND YOU WILL COMMENT. LET ME JUST SAY THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT WHAT I'M CONCERNED IS THAT THE WET LEASED THE WAY IT'S PHRASED RIGHT NOW. TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT RIGHT. SO YOU KNOW I I'M ACTUALLY IN SOME WAYS I'M FINE YOU KNOW WHAT. GO AHEAD GIVE IT OUT. THE QUESTION IS THAT. THE WAY IT'S PHRASED RIGHT NOW THAT- WHEN SOMEONE SAYS OH DID YOU COMPLY WITH THE LAW. SHOW ME EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE. EVERY PATIENT WHO ISSEEN ASA SIGN DOCUMENTS IN YOUR FILES AND I WOULD POINT OUT PARTICULARLY RULE PRACTICES- EITHER THE GUY DOING PAPER WHICH TASTED HAVE TO KEEP THE CAR YOU KNOW SOME. IN A FILING CABINET AND THEN JUST THAT JUST BUILDS UP- AND DISABILITY DOES LOTS OF PAPER OR- ANY OTHER EHR SYSTEM BUT THEN THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT. A PROGRAM TO DO THIS SO NOW THEY THEN GO BACK TO PAPER ORDERED TO HIRE SOMEONE TO REPROGRAM THE EHR WHICH IS BY THE WAY EXPENSIVE TO SELL THE BEST TIME TO BUY IT OFF THE SHELF. SO I THINK. AS I SAID IT'S- I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH YOU IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF NOTIFICATION I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY IN TERMS OF THE OBLIGATION TO PRACTICE. FOR FORSMAN PURPOSES RIGHT SO JUST TO FEEL THAT THEY COMPLIED WITH THE LAW. THAT WE NOT COMPEL THE PRACTICE TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO KEEP A COPY. AT A RECORD THAT THEY GAVE THIS DOCUMENT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL PATIENT AND THE DATE THEY GAVE IT YOU KNOW WHAT. THAT SHOW THAT YOU THAT. USE THAT IN YOUR NORMAL PRACTICES YOU HAVE IT ON THE WALL IT'S ON YOUR WEBSITE AND THAT. YOU KNOW THE YOUR CLERK OR SOMETHING ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT YOU DO PROVIDE THIS NOTICE ON A REGULAR BASIS TO THE PATIENTS AS THEY COME IN. AND THAT BE SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT YOU COMPLY WITH THIS PARTICULAR. BILL WHICH IF IT BECOMES A LAW THE LAW OF THE SIMPLIFIED TO BASICALLY SIMPLIFY. THE REQUIREMENTS. THAT ARE DEMANDED ON THE PRACTICE- IS A TERMS OF- THAT'D BE UNFORTUNATE OF THIS LITTLE. FUTURE LAW ON THE PRESS AFTER SO UNTRUE TO. BE SURE WE KNOW ADDED THIS BURDEN. ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON THE PRESS FLOOR STILL ESSENTIALLY DOING THE SAME THING THAT YOU'RE SEEKING. AND IF I COULD I'D TELL JUST WRAP IT UP BY VERY QUICKLY SAYING FIRST OF ALL I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU. TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE YOU KNOW. UNFORTUNATELY WE DO LIVE IN A LITIGIOUS SOCIETY THAT REQUIRES US TO ALWAYS PROTECT OURSELVES. THIS WAS A FORM OF PROTECTION I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT DOCTORS WERE PROTECTED AND- YOU KNOW WE WORKED WITH IN THE LAST SIX YEARS WE'VE WORKED ON TO VACCINATION RELATED BILLS. WHICH CMA SPONSOR. AND THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN GENERATED ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND EVERYBODY ELSE INVOLVED IT'S QUITE SIGNIFICANT AND THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PAPERWORK IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WHEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TO MAIL OUT TO PARENTS. A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ENORMOUS VOLUMES OF LETTERS REQUIRING. A RESPONSE BACK SO. WHATEVER YOU DO IN THIS ARENA I THINK IN ORDER TO PROTECT ONESELF THERE'S GONNA BE A NEED FOR DOCUMENTING WELL THAT'S JUST PART OF THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN. SO I THINK THAT APPLIES TO ALL OF US AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU OKAY WELL- I- I WOULD APPRECIATE. A FIRM COMMITMENT THAT- SOME ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS WHICH COULD BE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WHICH STILL ACHIEVE ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOUR BILL IS SEEKING TO ACHIEVE FILES REDUCING THOSE BURDENS. I DO SEND SOME RELUCTANCE THERE WHICH I'M A LITTLE DISTURBEDBY I WOULD POINT OUT- SINCE YOU MADE REFERENCE TO IT SP TWO SEVEN SEVEN ACTUALLY DIDN'T GO TO A PROTEST BECAUSE THERE WAS NO COST. AS SOMETHING SCHOOLS ALREADY HAD TO DO- BUT- I WOULD JUST- YES I HOPE THAT YOU'D BE WILLING TO AGAIN WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY I'M ACTUALLY ASKING YOU TO CHANGE ANYTHING WE'RE OBLIGATED TO DOCTORS TO DO. I JUST WANTED TO REDUCE THE OVER THE ADMINISTRATIVE. BURDENS ON THE PRACTICE WHICH OF COURSE RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS YOU KNOW HEALTH CARE COSTS TO. BE MINOR BUT AGAIN JUST CUMULATIVELY SELF- YEAH I WANT TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL BUT I HOPE THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD APPRECIATE THE CHANGES YOU'VE MADE. I THINK HIS FINAL ELEMENT OF- AGAIN REDUCING THE ADDITIONAL MYSTERY BURDEN WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL- AND- I HOPE THAT YOU CAN COMMIT TO THAT- WHEN DID. THIS BILL COMES OUT OF COMMITTEE THANK YOU. DR BEN THANK YOU YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT AND WHAT I WOULD ALSO ASK. MISTER CHAIR IF YOU DON'T MIND I'M HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AS WELL. EVEN SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD FROM THIS COMMITTEE. FOR ALL OF US TO WORK TOGETHER SO THAT SO THAT ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE. GOING TO BE COMING UP NOW. AGAIN SHOULD THE BILL MOVES FORWARD I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU MIKE MY GOAL IS FOR THIS BILL TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THIS ISSUE THAT'S THE- FUNDAMENTAL KEY COMPONENTS SO. WHATEVER WE CAN TO MEET THAT OBJECTIVE. THE PHONE NUMBER JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR I THINK WHAT DR PANAS ASKING. IS IF YOU WILL COMMIT THAT FOR ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES MAY PHYSICIAN. SIMPLY ATTEST THAT THIS. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT WAS COMPLIED WITH. AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO MAINTAIN. A PAPER OR ELECTRONIC RECORDS. OF COVERING ANNUAL DISCLOSURES TO HOWEVER MANY PATIENTS THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES SO. IT'S AN ATTESTATION I THINK THAT HE'S ASKING FOR SO PERHAPS YOU COULD. FURTHER ADDRESS THAT IF YOU BELIEVE IT APPROPRIATE IN YOUR CLOTHES. THANK YOU I WILL. THANK YOU SENATOR PANZER BACKER. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S DEDICATION AND PASSION TO THIS ISSUE. THIS BILL WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE EXPOSURE TO THIS DATABASE AGAIN JUST TWENTY VERY CLEAR SO THE POSTING IN THE OFFICE WHICH IS BAR ALL THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD I BELIEVE- HANDING TO THE PATIENT AND THE PATIENT'S SIGNING THAT THEY'VE RECEIVED THIS. THEN IT WOULD BE VERY CLEAR YOU GET THIS FROM EVERY DOCTOR YOU GO TO SHOW EVERY SPECIALIST EVERY DOCTOR YOU WILL GET ACCESS TO THE SAME PAPER ABOUT THE SAME DATABASE THAT'S LOTS OF EXPOSURE SO. I MADE IT VERY CLEAR THE AUTHOR I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL WITH THE ANNUAL REQUIREMENT I THINK THE BANG FOR THE BUCK IT IS JUST NOT THERE SO WHICH IS TO CLARIFY WITH YOUR ROTH I THINK. WITHIN A PEN WAS SAYING NOT JUST. THE ATTESTATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL DISCLOSURE BUT- THAT THE ANNUAL DISCLOSURE ITSELF BE BE REMOVED FROM THE BILL SO. IF YOU COMMIT TO THAT I WILL SUPPORT IF NOT I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING IT HERE TODAY. SERMON THANK YOU- I TOO WAS A LITTLE UNCLEAR IN YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH CENTER PAN IF YOU WOULD COMMIT TO WORKING WITH HIM- I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL PROVIDED THAT YOU DRESS IN THE CONCERNS I THINK IF THERE IS- YOU KNOW DISCLOSURES ALWAYS WORTHWHILE AND EXPERIENCE YOU DESCRIBED AS IT IS A TROUBLING ONE- YOU KNOW MANY OF US GO INTO OUR OFFICES OF ANY KIND AND WE DON'T READ WHAT'S ON THE WALLS YOU KNOW WE WERE ON OUR PHONES WE JUST GO IN SO I UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF THIS BUT I THINK. THE OPPOSITION AND A LOT OF DOCTORS IN MY COMMUNITY HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH KEEPING A LOT OF RECORDS ON FILE IN PERPETUITY- SO IF YOU COMMIT TO WORKING WITH DR CENTER PANEL ON ON THIS ISSUE I CAN SUPPORT THIS AND APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON THIS. ISSUE THANK YOU. SERMON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST ALSO WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR RIGHT BY- CENTER BACKER HAS- FAIRLY WELL ARTICULATED MY OWN POSITION- AND SO FOR THE OTHER TWO JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR- BASED ON THE NUMBER CONVERSATION WE HAD I AM EQUALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL IF IT CONTAINS AN EXPLICIT AMENDMENT O REMOVE THE ANNUAL INFORMATION REQUIREMENT- BUT IF NOT AS I SAID I. UNDERSTAND THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR JONES I JUST WANTED TO- CHIME IN ON THE SAME ISSUE AND I WISH I HAD WHEN YOU CONTACT ME OR WE CAN I SHOULD EXPLAIN THATTO YOU THAT THAT WAS MY ONE CONCERN IS THE ANNUAL NOTIFICATION SO I WAS% GONNA VOTE NO TODAY I'LL LAY OFF TODAY AND- ASIAN OF THE- MOMENTUM THAT. WE HAVE HERE AND HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT THE NEXT COMMITTEE. WHAT DOES NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR IT TO BE SUPPORTED IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. SENATOR SO I DO HOPE E. R. B. I DO HOPE YOU HAVE THE TRUST IN ME TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON IT. COLLINGS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS CENTER BACKERS AT YOUR MICROPHONE MOVING UP. I GUESS I'M JUST NOT CLEAR WHAT THE COMMITMENT IS EXACTLY ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE THAT OUT- I DON'T REALLY SEE A MIDDLE GROUND IN TERMS OF WORKING. TO ADDRESS THAT THERE'S IF I MAY I'M HAPPY TO I WAS JUST WAITING FOR ALL THE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND IT SEEMS LIKE THIS MAY BE A STICKING POINT THIS WAS ONE OF THE POINTS THAT CMA HAD BROUGHT UP- AND SO I SIGNIFICANTLY. CHANGE THE BILL TOOK OUT A MAJOR COMPONENT THAT WAS UNDERSTANDABLY THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE I MYSELF SAW THE WHEN YOU BURTON OFFICES BY HAVING TO HAVE THEIR ASSISTANT GO THROUGH THIS DOCUMENT THIS WEBSITE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTORS ARE AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT CONTRIBUTION THE CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF AMOUNTS OF CONTRIBUTION- SURPASSES A CERTAIN CERTAIN THRESHOLD OR NOT I COULD UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH WORK THAT CREATES THE I AND I IN NO WAY INTENDED FOR TO CREATE. OR BE SUCH A BIG BURDEN OF NOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SIGNATURES COLLEAGUES LET'S LET'S LET'S PLEASE BE FRANK WITH ONE ANOTHER ALSO HOW MANY TIMES DO WE GO TO A DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN THERE MAYBE IN A YEAR'S TIME TWO YEARS TIME. BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THE INSURANCE DOCUMENTATION HAS CHANGED THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAS CHANGED EVERY THREE YEARS WERE REQUIRED TO SIGN THE DOCUMENTS- YOU KNOW I JUST SHOWED UP TO MY- MY ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON'S OFFICE AND- I NEEDED TO FILL OUT. ALL SEVEN PAGES OF DOCUMENTATION OF WHAT FAMILY ISSUES I'VE HAD IN THE PAST BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE THINGS MAY HAVE CHANGED OVER THE COURSE OF THE SEVEN YEARS THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE ALLERGIES MIGHT DEVELOP. SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. I THINK THAT MR BECKER THERE IS A MIDDLE GROUND AS AS WE WERE TALKING AND THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE WEEKEND- I SEE IT AS SOMETHING WHERE. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THE ANNUAL OUT AS I SAID THIS TO YOU AS WELL OVER THE WEEKEND ON IT'S JUST IT'S COMING IN SO LATE IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO. COMMIT TO YOU TO SOMETHING- BECAUSE IT FORCES ME INTO A REVOKE HERBAL POSITION IF I DO SO BUT AS I SAID TO YOU OVER THE PHONE I AM HAPPY. TO WORK WITH YOU ON COMING UP WITH A THREE YEAR TIMELINE SIMMONS HIP- WHEN YOU FILL OUT THE HIPPA DOCUMENTS. WHY NOT ATTACH THIS FORM. SO ON OR WHAT. PLEASE OFFER SOME OTHER SUGGESTIONS I AM HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU. AND AGAIN IF THE IF THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO BE INVOLVED I WOULD ASK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO BE INVOLVED WITH THIS IN THIS DIALOGUE AS WELL. I'M HAPPY TO ACCOMMODATE THE ONLY THING IS THAT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME LEVEL OF FREQUENCY. BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I. I DO AGREE WITH ME. MR BECKER ABOUT CENTER BECKER ABOUT THE FACT THAT- SOME SOME PATIENTS HAVE MULTIPLE DOCTORS YOU'RE COMPLETELY ACCURATE ABOUT THAT. BUT IT'S ALSO A DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUE. I RIGHT NOW ONLY NEED MAYBE ONE OR TWO DOCTORS I KNOW IN ABOUT TEN YEARS TIME. I PROBABLY FULL FEE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT DOCTORS SO I DO UNDERSTAND THAT EXPOSURE ARGUMENT- I JUST FEEL LIKE IN ORDER TO CAPTURE SOME OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE SENSITIVE THAT MIGHT NOT BE. AS EXPOSED WE NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A MIDDLE GROUND SO I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU. I I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU. I JUST CAN'T SEE I CAN CONFIRM THAT WE TAKE THAT OUT BECAUSE IF I DO- THERE'S NO POINT OF RETURN AT THAT POINT BUT I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCOMMODATE CHANGING. I EVEN OFFERED TO CHANGE IT BASED ON IT BUT- I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT RIGHT NOW- BUT- BUT OTHERWISE- AGAIN YOU HAVE MY FIRM COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU. ALREADY SUMMER MEMBER I THINK ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE ASKING FOR IS SOME. SOME CERTAINTY. WITH REGARD TO THE COMMITMENTS. SO IF I'M UNDERSTANDING YOU CORRECTLY YOU COMMITTED. TO CHANGING. THE ANNUAL REQUIREMENT IF NOT DELETING IT DID I HEAR YOU SAY CHANGES I DID NOT SEE DELETE I DID SAY I AM HAPPY TO CHANGE IT. AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. THAT THAT MIDDLE GROUND IS. TO MAKE IT TO MAKE IT LESS FREQUENT NOT MORE FREQUENT EXACTLY AND DID I UNDERSTAND YOU TO COMMIT TO. CHANGING THE RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENT TO SOMETHING AKIN TO WHAT SENATOR PAN WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH WHICH IS A- PHYSICIAN AT THE STATION. YES I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT AS WELL. BECAUSE OF COURSE. COLLEAGUES MAKE DECISIONS ON WHETHER THEY VOTE YES OR NO OR VOTE AT ALL BASED ON WHAT OFFICERS COMMIT TO DO IT OF COURSE ONCE AUTHORS LEAVE THIS COMMITTEE THEN THERE ARE WAYS FOR US TO YOU KNOW DEAL WITH BILLS WHERE THE COMMITMENTS HAVEN'T BEEN MADE I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR HERE SENATOR HERTEL THOUGH DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION COMMENT OR CONCERN. JUST A QUICK COMMENT OF MR CHAIR APPOINTED TO THAT YOU THINK. THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I KNOW WHEN I FIRST TOOK A LOOK AT IT. I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME TRYING TO SUPPORT IT AND- BUT AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO REALLY HAVE MUCH APPRECIATE APPRECIATE. THAT THE PASSION AND THE EFFORT THAT HE'S PUTTING IN TO TRY TO. PROTECT PATIENTS A BIT OF HIS OF HIS DISTRICT- AND I CAN. REALLY IDENTIFY WITH THAT AS WELL- AND I KNOW THAT THE BILL IS NOT PERFECT THAT NEEDS SOME WORK. BUT I THINK IT DESERVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD- DETER STOLE SEVERAL HURDLES THAT- HE'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL ULTIMATELY GET SIGNED AND PASSED AND- YOU KNOW AS I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HIM OVER THE WEEKEND I DON'T THINK THAT. EUROPE ALL THE GOOD DOCTORS OUT THERE SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR THE FIVE VERY FEW BAD ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE BUT- AHA AS I. MENTIONED EARLIER I ALSO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THAT HE'S PUT INTO THIS AND- HAPPY TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER NEWMAN. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SERVIC I DO APPRECIATE. WHAT THE AUTHOR SET OUT TO DO- BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE AS I THINK I'M LISTENING ON THE GO SPEAK FOR MORE THAN JUST MYSELF- AND SO. I'M LOOKING- YOU PROBABLY HAVE A VOTE COUNT- BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU MY VOTE COUNTS MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT I AM LOOKING FOR AN EXPLICIT COMMITMENT. FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE ANNUAL REQUIREMENT- TO APPRISE PATIENTS- AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE A COMMITMENT- BUT IF NOT- I WANNA MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT I WILL BE STAYING UP THIS BILL TODAY. WELL WHEN I MET YOU DON'T WE DON'T NEGOTIATE. AMENDMENTS IN COMMITTEE- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS SO YOU CAN PROVIDE WHATEVER COMMITMENT SURE. ABLE TO PROVIDE IN RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUE'S QUESTIONS AND THEN- THEY WILL- THEY WILL DECIDE ACCORDINGLY. I SEE NO OTHER MIKES UP SO- THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR HER TITLE. SO YOU ARE FREE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO COMMIT TO I DON'T KNOW IF MY FIRSTBORN IS GONNA BE ENOUGH AT THIS POINT- MISTER NEWMAN I RESPECT YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM BUT- WENDY CAN BE YOUR MOTHER. COULD BE YOUR SPOUSE COULD BE YOUR SISTER. THIS BILL IS NOT A SPONSORED BILL THIS BILL WAS THE AGONY OF A CONSTITUENT. WHO TOOK THE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES HAVE A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY IN ORDER TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMETHING WE TEACH SOMETHING ARE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TEACH. SHE TOOK THAT STEP. AND THEN SHE WENT IN FOR RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND HAS BEEN PAYING THE PRICE FOR IT SINCE IT COULD BE ANY OF OUR- THE WIND LOVED WOMEN IN OUR LIVES- I MEAN WE BOTH ARE ALSO PART OF A CAUCUS THAT TALKS ABOUT TIKKUN OLAM SO I'M JUST TRYING THIS IS MY SMALL WAY. OF REPAIRING THE WORLD- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE ON THE MEDICAL BOARD. SO THAT PHYSICIANS WHO COMMIT ATROCIOUS ACTS LIKE THIS AREN'T JUST FIND A THOUSAND DOLLARS. GIVEN THE PAIN AND SUFFERING WHEN HE HAS GONE THROUGH THIS POSITION WAS ONLY HELD LIABLE TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS. EIGHT SOMETHING THAT REVEALS AND ALLOWS EVERYONE TO KNOW FURTHER CREATES ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT'S A GOOD THING. WE DON'T HAVE CLOAKED PROBLEMS WITH OUR DISCLOSURES THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO ABIDE BY. THE MORE DISCLOSURE THE BETTER IT IS SO- FOLKS THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION IS THAT DIRECTOR OR EDUCATING THERE'S THREE EASE AND GOVERNMENT THAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT THIS EDUCATING THERE'S ENGINEERING AND THERE'S ENFORCEMENT. ENGINEERING AND ENFORCEMENT ARE REALLY COSTLY EDUCATING IS THE BEST WAY. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST I FIND IT SOMEWHAT INTERESTING THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THIS BILL WENT THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY I HAVE TWO DOCTORS IN MY HOUSE DR CULA WEBER AND DOCTOR OF LOOKING AROUND BILA. WHO VOTED FOR THIS BILL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS COME FROM THEM. IN FACT ONE OF THEM VOTED TWICE BECAUSE IT CAME UP IN A COMMITTEE AS WELL AS ON THE FLOOR- I DON'T KNOW WHAT COMMITMENT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. BUT I AM HAPPY TO. MAKE THE CHANGES NECESSARY. AND I DON'T KNOW OF RIGHT NOW I'M BEING HEARD OR NOT BUT I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THE CHANGES NECESSARY. TO WIN YOUR SUPPORT BUT I CAN'T COMMIT TO JUST TAKING SOMETHING OUT RIGHT NOW. AND THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO DISCUSS IT AND AGAIN AS I ASKED IF THE CHECK IF THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO BE INVOLVED IN THESE CONVERSATIONS. I'M HAPPY TO STICK BY MY COMMITMENT AND SEE HOW WE CAN MEET HALFWAY OR MAYBE EVEN 60% 70% YOUR WEIGHT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE OF A COMMITMENT I CAN GIVE AT THIS POINT BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT IT SIR. IT'S OBVIOUSLY YOUR PREROGATIVE HE'S CLOSING. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.
