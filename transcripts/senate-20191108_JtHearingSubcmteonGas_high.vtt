HOSPITALIZATION OR MEDICAL CARE

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:35.787
I BELIEVE AND FIGURE OUT. THERE

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:37.956
IS A LOT OF OTHER TYPES OF

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:39.391
INFRASTRUCTURE HITS THAT WERE

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:42.627
NOT CAPTURING IN THE MANDATORY

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:43.228
REPORTING I THINK A LOT OF IT

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:46.998
WAS. HARD SOLD FOR. ALL THE

00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:47.599
DIFFERENT TYPES FOR STRUCTURE

00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:51.369
BUT. WE WILL HAVE A REGULATION

00:22:51.436 --> 00:22:56.408
IN EFFECT. FIRST FOR MANDATORY

00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:57.008
REPORTING OF THOSE DAMAGES AND

00:22:57.075 --> 00:22:59.244
THE ONE. TRANSMITTER ARE

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:05.250
DIRECTLY TO US. YEAH I GUESS

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:05.817
FOR ME THE QUESTION COMES TO

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:09.221
MIND OF THE GAP. ISSUE I MEAN I

00:23:09.287 --> 00:23:11.356
JUST RECENTLY MET THE ONLY ONE

00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:14.226
WHO WAS VERY SERIOUSLY BURNED

00:23:14.292 --> 00:23:18.697
IN THAT EFFORT UNDERGROUND. A

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:20.799
FRENCH FOREIGN YES IT WAS EXT

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:21.399
IN A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. AND

00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:25.837
THE. SO IT KIND OF BROUGHT THAT

00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:26.805
HOME TO ME THAT IT COULD BE

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:28.473
ELECTRICAL AS WELL THANK YOU.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.210
YES SENATOR GALGIANI. YOUR MOST

00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:34.980
WHAT WHAT COMES TO MIND TO ME

00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:35.547
IS THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A

00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:38.116
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. YOU CAN

00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:40.185
MAKE THE REQUIREMENT BUT IF

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:40.986
PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED ABOUT THE

00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:42.654
IMPORTANCE OF AIDS IT WILL. BE

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:43.188
MINE FOR SOMEBODY AND THEY

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:48.260
WOULD. INNOCENTLY JUST NOT JUST

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:49.628
NOT FOLLOW THE LAW BECAUSE THEY

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:52.130
DON'T KNOW BUT GIVEN THE BIRDS

00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:52.697
THAT WERE HAPPENING ALL OVER

00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:55.834
THE STATE. COUPLE IN FACT TO

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:56.835
MAKE THIS MORE PUBLIC AND

00:23:56.902 --> 00:23:59.971
REMIND PEOPLE OF. THIS PAST AND

00:24:00.038 --> 00:24:01.273
CONNECTEDWITH WHAT'S CURRENTLY

00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:04.009
HAPPENING. I THINK TO PUT THAT

00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:06.044
INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR FOLKS IT

00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:08.180
WOULD IT WOULD BE A CAUTIONARY

00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:09.514
WARNING AND PEOPLE WOULD BE

00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:12.017
VERY PARANOID ABOUT ANY KIND OF

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:14.286
THAT- INTRUSION I GAS LINE

00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:16.421
AFTER THAT. SO I THINK THAT WE

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:18.023
NEED TO DO MORE TO EDUCATE

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:22.127
FOLKS AND MAKE IT MORE

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:22.694
PROMINENT IN THE MEDIA SOME

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:29.534
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT. WELL I'M

00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:31.069
IN AND I KNOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:31.670
WITH THE CONFIDENTIAL SAFETY

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:33.004
REPORTING PROGRAM THAT. WITH

00:24:33.071 --> 00:24:36.241
THE BETWEEN FAA AND NASA. AND

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:36.875
THIS IS NOT A- BOOK FOR LOWER

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:39.144
PROGRAM AS WE KNOW BUT A CLOSE

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:40.278
ALL REPORTING SYSTEM FOR NEAR

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:42.881
MISS EVENTS. THINK THIS TYPE OF

00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:46.051
PROGRAM COULD BE USEFUL IN THE

00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:46.651
EXCAVATION SPACE WOULD THIS BE

00:24:46.718 --> 00:24:50.121
A BETTER. WORSE THAN REQUIRING

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:50.922
EXCAVATORS TO CALL EIGHT ONE

00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:54.926
FOLLOWING INCIDENT. THAT'S A

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:55.460
VERY INTERESTING QUESTION

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:59.898
SENATOR. THE CLOSE CALL

00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:01.433
REPORTING SYSTEM I KNOW WHEN

00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:03.802
THE AT START UP IT DID TAKE

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:05.270
THEM Là MAYBE DECADES TO RAMP

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:08.673
UP- AND THE BIGGEST PART THAT

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.609
WAS THAT PEOPLE OF WITHIN THE

00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:12.210
ORGANIZATION ONE SIMILAR TO

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:14.913
WHERE WHERE WHEN FROM THEY DID

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.382
NOT SAY TRUST IT BECAUSE- IT

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:20.452
WAS A NEW TYPE OF. TELLING ON

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:23.154
PEOPLE. AND THEY DIDN'T TRUST

00:25:23.221 --> 00:25:24.256
THE PROCESS WOULD BE.

00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:26.291
CONFIDENTIAL FOR THEM- THEY

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:28.560
DON'T TRUST THAT THE PURPOSE

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:29.160
WAS REALLY JUST A PICTURE OF

00:25:29.227 --> 00:25:32.230
PEOPLE- THAT WE HAD

00:25:32.297 --> 00:25:33.865
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE INDUSTRY

00:25:33.932 --> 00:25:37.402
AND IT WASN'T IN BLANK. AND SO.

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:38.803
ANY EFFORT THAT WE HAD RUN IN

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:45.911
THIS THING. IT IS PERHAPS A

00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:46.544
HARD FOR ME RIGHT NOW TO GET MY

00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:50.749
MIND AROUND. WITH ALL THE

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:51.349
DIFFERENT TYPES OF COAL THAT'S

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:53.451
HOW I WOULD WORK. BUT I THINK

00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:58.123
IT MAKES SENSE. NO THE PUBLIC

00:25:58.189 --> 00:25:58.723
UTILITIES COMMISSION HAVE BEEN

00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.324
THINKING ABOUT AND WORKING ON

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:02.193
IT. AS ECHO I DON'T REALLY KNOW

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.095
THE STATUS ON IT BUT IT MIGHT

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:07.465
BE REASONABLE TO START OUT THAT

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:08.667
THIS AT LEAST PICK ONE

00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:11.803
INDUSTRY. MAYBE. ONE INDUSTRY

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.972
WITH A SMALL OUT OF OPERATOR TO

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:17.242
OUR SMALL AMOUNT OF. OF

00:26:17.309 --> 00:26:20.312
PLAYERS. THAT IT EASIER TO MAKE

00:26:20.378 --> 00:26:24.215
SURE THAT THE MAN JUST. WHILE I

00:26:24.282 --> 00:26:27.852
MAY BE OPEN TO A- ROLL OUT THE

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.220
MESSAGING- GRADUALLY IN MANY

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:32.891
YEARS. IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:35.794
YOUR SAFETY CULTURE THAT REALLY

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.263
DOES PRIOR TIES. MAKING SURE

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.100
THAT WORK. I. CONTINUING THE

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:46.104
COMMUNICATION I THINK THAT. ONE

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:47.505
WAY OR ANOTHER THAT'S REALLY

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:50.976
THE WAY THE DIRECTION. YEAH I

00:26:51.042 --> 00:26:52.310
KNOW YOU'VE ALWAYS FELT THE

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:54.846
NOTICED AND APPRECIATED BEST OF

00:26:54.913 --> 00:26:58.416

OUTREACH PROGRAMS WHICH WE

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.090
TALKED ABOUT AND IT'S BEEN A

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:10.028
REAL PRIORITY. THE NO DOUBT THE

00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:11.029
FIRST FEW YEARS AND PERHAPS

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:12.163
MORE OF THE BOARD NEEDS TO LET

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.099
IN THE IN THE EXT COMMUNITY

HAS BEEN REPORTED AS THE ORIGIN

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:28.313
OF THE- FOR US THERE COULD BE

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:28.747
MANY BUSINESSES NOT

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:29.681
TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED.

00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:34.319
INVOLVED IN EXCAVATION. WOULD

BENEFIT FROM YOUR EDUCATION AND

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.621
OUTREACH SIMILAR TO BATTLE

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:38.323
EARLIER WHAT PORTS PLANS FOR

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.058
REACHING THESE AN ANTICIPATED

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:49.434
ENTITIES. WE HAVE THANK YOU. WE

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.736
HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:52.337
THIS EXTENSIVELY FOR THE LAST

00:27:52.404 --> 00:27:53.671
TWO YEARS OF. THE BOARD BEING

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:59.310
TOGETHER. ONE OF THE DIRECTIONS

00:27:59.377 --> 00:28:00.745
THAT ONE OF THINGS WERE YOU

00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:02.280
WANT TO DO WHEN WE GO OUT JUST

00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:03.048
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A

00:28:03.114 --> 00:28:06.017
PROGRAM THAT SPEAKS DIRECTLY.

00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:09.754
THE INDUSTRIES THAT THING WITH.

00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:15.460
I'VE BEEN IN THE EDUCATIONAL.

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:18.430
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:19.764
ONE THING THAT I ASSISTED IN

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:23.868
THE- CATION COMMITTEE ALONG

00:28:23.935 --> 00:28:26.337
WITH OUR FELLOW MEMBER JOHNSON.

00:28:26.404 --> 00:28:30.575
ONE THING IS A BOARD THAT WE.

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:32.777
WHEN WE DEVELOP THESE PROGRAMS

00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:36.147
WE OF COURSE ARE DOING REGION.

00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:39.851
WE ARE SPEAKING TO IT THREE AND

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:40.452
ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES. WAS AS

00:28:40.518 --> 00:28:43.088
WELL. DIFFERENT ON DIFFERENT

00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:45.924
TYPES OF WAYS TO PROMOTE

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.025
EDUCATION US THAT THEY'RE

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:49.027
PRETTY MUCH COOKIE CUTTER ONE

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:50.261
THING THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:50.895
IN THE BOARD WANTS TO MAKE SURE

00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:53.231
BEFORE WE ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:54.365
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT ONLY

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:57.802
AFFECT OF. AN EFFICIENT AND

00:28:57.869 --> 00:28:58.303
THAT IT ACTUALLY MAKES A

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:01.973
DIFFERENCE. WE WANT TO TAKE THE

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.676
SPORT A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:05.276
THAT'S MISSING IS AS YOU KNOW

00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:08.913
WE ARE. DIVERSE STATE AS MANY

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.983
CULTURES. ONE OF THE MAIN

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.787
REASONS THAT. THIS HAPPENED

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:17.655
WITHIN A MY PERSONAL LIFE IS

00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:19.724
BECAUSE THE TRAINING WILL

00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.926
AFFECT TO INDUSTRY WAS IN THE

00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:23.828
LANGUAGE THAT THEY WOULD UNDER

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:27.599
AND THAT'S TRULY. ONE OF THE

00:29:27.665 --> 00:29:30.301
IMPORTANT. ISSUES THAT HAVE. HE

00:29:30.368 --> 00:29:32.737
LOOKED OUT WE WANTED AS A BOARD

00:29:32.804 --> 00:29:34.639
TO GO OUT AND CREATE SOMETHING

00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:37.809
THAT IS SPECIFIC TO INDUSTRY.

00:29:37.876 --> 00:29:41.279
SPECIFIC TO CULTURE. AND SPEAKS

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:42.714
A DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ONE THING

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.051
BEING THAT I AM. CAN ONE THAT

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:48.786
SPEAKS TO MY CULTURE FIRST. AND

00:29:48.853 --> 00:29:51.856
AT HOME TO FOUND. IT'S WHY I'VE

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:54.425
DEDICATED MY LIFE TO THAT. THE

00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:55.426
THING THAT WE WANT TO GO OUT OF

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:57.362
SUPPORT. FOR THAT ARE FOR. AND

00:29:57.428 --> 00:29:57.962
TO SAY WE WANT TO GET YOU HOME

00:29:58.029 --> 00:30:00.265
TO YOUR- THAT'S A DIFFERENT

00:30:00.331 --> 00:30:02.133
APPROACH THAN GOING. THESE ARE

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.468
THE REGULATIONS THIS IS WHAT

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:05.670
SHE SHOULD. LAW I WANT TO MAKE

00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:08.072
SURE THAT WE AS A BOARD DEVELOP

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:09.874
SOMETHING THAT. IS SPEAKING TO

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:10.742
THE NOT ONLY TO THE EMPLOYEE

00:30:10.808 --> 00:30:13.611
BUT TO THE- POLICE. SO WE ARE

00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:14.812
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:16.814
TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. WE LOOK.

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:19.017
FOR AVENUES ONLY FOUND THAT.

00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:20.552
THE BEST RESOURCES TO DEVOTE OF

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:24.055
THESE PROGRAMS ARE HERE WITH

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:26.491
IT. OR WE HAVE THE TALENT. WE

00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:32.263
HAVE AND. TO FOCUS ON THAT

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:32.797
WOULD HAVE HAD OUR ANNUAL

EDUCATE. ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:39.003
WITH SIX FULL FORMS OF THIS

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.638
LAST WEEK WE HAD IT LOS ANGELES

00:30:40.705 --> 00:30:41.272
DEPARTMENT OF WATER PART IN THE

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:43.508
TURNOUT WAS INCREDIBLE. SO THE

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:44.809
COMFORT LEVEL IT THERE WE ARE

IN THE FOREFRONT AND. IT'S

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.529
PROGRAMS ONLY ABOUT. TRIED TO

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:05.163
THINK ABOUT ALL THIS AND TRY TO

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.499
KEEP IT ALL TOGETHER OUR HEAD.

00:31:08.566 --> 00:31:10.001
WELL WE DECIDED WE COULDN'T AND

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:12.103
SO WE DEVELOP THE AN

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.073
EDUCATIONAL RICH PLAN OUR

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:15.573
EDUCATION OUR TO OFFICER

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.174
KRISTEN Là THOMAS AND PUT IT

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:19.677
TOGETHER. ON PAGE EIGHTY SIX

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:20.745
THE REPORT ABOUT A GRAPH OF THE

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:25.450
IMPLEMENTATION BUT REALLY. IT

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:26.117
REALLY HAS TO COME IN THREE

00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:28.620
PHASES FIRST WE HAVE TO

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:32.357
IDENTIFY OF THE NEEDS AND WE

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:34.492
HEAR THE NEEDS OF HERE CALL IT

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.793
WONDER WHERE I HAVE IDENTIFIED

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.396
ALL THESE OTHER NONTRADITIONAL

00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:41.032
STAKEHOLDERS OF THE SECOND IS

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:45.236
TO DEVELOP THE MATERIALS TO

00:31:45.303 --> 00:31:47.939
REACH THEM AND- THIS IS A FLY.

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:53.011
A. I'LL CHALLENGE IS GOING TO

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:57.115
BE IN THE APPOINTMENT. DID WITH

00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:57.682
HELPING THE EDUCATION HOURS

00:31:57.749 --> 00:32:03.087
PLAN. AS YOU TO TALK A LITTLE

00:32:03.154 --> 00:32:05.023
BIT ABOUT OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:08.259
IDENTIFY COM BUT THE THINGS

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:10.495
THAT WERE GOING TO LOOK AT NOW

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:12.897
AND- HOPING TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:32:12.964 --> 00:32:16.434
WE HAVE THE TIME AND RESOURCES

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:18.369
TO DO SO. THIS WE NEED TO

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:21.472
DEVELOP INVEST IN PRESENT. FOR

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:22.040
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:25.576
INVESTIGATION. THAT MATERIAL

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:27.045
AND RESTING GATORS TO HAVE WITH

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:28.946
THEM IN THEIR CARS WHEN THEY GO

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:32.617
OUT TO PROVIDE- THE PEOPLE

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:36.988
THEY'RE ACTING BECAUSE IN.

00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:38.656
RIGHT NOW OUR INVESTIGATORS ARE.

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:39.290
WHICH ON THE GROUND THERE THERE

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:42.827
THE FACE OF. PEOPLE THAT

00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:43.261
THEY'RE INTERACTING

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:48.533
STAKEHOLDERS. AND WORSE MORE

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:49.133
STILL AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.537
EXACTLY THE MEANS. DURING THAT

00:32:52.603 --> 00:32:53.905
APPOINTMENT WE HAVE SOME IDEAS

00:32:53.971 --> 00:32:57.175
FOR INSTANCE- CITIES ARE GOING

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:59.711
TO BE A MAJOR SOURCE A MAJOR

00:32:59.777 --> 00:33:01.979
OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IT'S NOT

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:02.880
JUST THAT THEY DO ONE THING OR

00:33:02.947 --> 00:33:04.882
ONE KIND OF EXCAVATION.

00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:07.985
OPERATORS ARE EXCAVATOR OF MANY

00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:09.053
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.656
CITIES HAVE OTHER OTHER THAN

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:16.027
DAY TO. THERE THERE OF. MAJOR

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:16.728
YOU CAN KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT

00:33:16.794 --> 00:33:17.195
THEY'RE ON BOARD THEY

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:18.463
UNDERSTAND THEIR FALLING BEST

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:21.933
PRACTICES THAT WE THINK IT'S

00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:23.201
GONNA A LOT IT'S GOING TO FLOW

00:33:23.267 --> 00:33:23.701
FROM THERE AND WERE. THE

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:25.970
STRATEGIES THAT WILL. JUST TO

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:29.907
FIND SOME. SOME CITIES THAT ARE

00:33:29.974 --> 00:33:32.777
ONE OF THE MODEL CITIES TO

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:35.012
START WORKING ON ON ALL THE

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:38.950
DETAILS OF THE WE MIGHT.

00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:42.186
SENATORS TELLING GALGIANI. IF

00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:42.620
YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME

CLOSELY WITH THEM THERE'S GREAT

00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:21.652
RESOURCE ISSUE WE JUST WANT TO

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:22.353
MAKE SURE THAT WE DEVELOP

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.387
SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:35:23.454 --> 00:35:26.324
DIFFERENT AND THAT WE WOULD

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:29.527
ACTUALLY SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO.

00:35:29.594 --> 00:35:34.131
ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND.

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:35.566
REQUIREMENTS IS THAT. WHEN I

00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:37.702
THINK ABOUT CGA THAT'S THE

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:38.269
FIRST THING I THINK ABOUT IS

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:42.773
THAT STICKER. STICKER AND CJ

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.608
WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ACTION THE

00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:44.475
EIGHT ONE ONE NUMBER BEFORE. I

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:46.110
WAS A TO THAT EIGHT I THINK YOU

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:47.745
JUST HAD TO FIND THE RIGHT

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.780
NUMBER OF THE CALL CENTER IN

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:53.851
REGARD TO MARKET ATTEND. BUT

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:55.786
THAT'S IF. THAT'S THEIR THING

00:35:55.853 --> 00:35:56.587
THAT'S WHERE THEY THEY DO WELL

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:58.623
IF YOU DON'T. THAT APPLIES TO

00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:06.664
YOU. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T THEN.

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:10.167
AND WHERE WE NEED AND. AND THE

00:36:10.234 --> 00:36:17.141
CALLING IS. THE GREATEST

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:19.710
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE SAFETY.

00:36:19.777 --> 00:36:26.484
FATALITIES. IT REALLY IS

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:29.220
EXCAVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:34.525
THERE'S BEEN ISSUES BETWEEN OUR

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:36.360
X. RETURN OPERATOR THAT LED TO

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:39.263
WELL NEVER JUST ONE THING BUT A

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.565
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT LED TO

00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:43.668
THE ACCENT ACT HAPPENING AND SO

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:47.171
THAT'S WHY- WHILE THE EDUCATE

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:48.973
PROGRAM NEEDS TO FOCUS ON

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.574
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.908
THAT IT APPLIES TO THEM TO CALL

00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:54.178
THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:36:54.245 --> 00:36:54.779
IMPROVE SAFETY EVEN AFTER THE

00:36:54.845 --> 00:37:00.217
CALL. IT'S VERY GOOD. I WANTED

00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:01.552

EDUCATION IN LIEU OF FINE IN

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:09.093

TRAINING OF WHAT LED THE BOARD

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:17.335
TO. CHOOSE THAT OPTION. WE WANT

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.669
TO BE FREE OF FAIR BOARD WE

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:20.605
WANT TO BE A BOARD THAT PEOPLE

FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING TO US

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:25.376
WE- I'M A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:27.111
I WORK WITH A SMALL TO MEDIUM

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:29.480
SIZED SAYS AND ONE. CONTINUE TO

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:31.349
HERE IS YOU KNOW ARE WE

00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:32.917
DEVELOPING ANOTHER ORGANIZATION

00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:37.855
THAT'S JUST GOING TO THE DOCTOR.

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:38.489
FINDS ON FAMILIAR WITH CAL OSHA

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:43.494

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:46.864
COME AND IN A WELCOME THEM. IN

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:48.899

THAT THEM FOR FINDING SOMETHING

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.635
THAT WE WANT THEM TO. SO OUR

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:53.037
APPROACH IS REALLY FOCUSING ON

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:53.638
EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT'S TRULY

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:58.242

THE GROUNDS ON A DAILY BASIS.

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:05.850
YOU'RE NOT AWARE AND IT WOULD

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:07.184
HAVE A STAYS UP WITH THE

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:08.819
LEADERSHIP THEY DO THE REQUIRED

00:38:08.886 --> 00:38:11.389
TRAINING AS FAR. OSHA REQUIRES

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:14.258
HOWEVER IT DOESN'T SEEM TO

00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:16.093
TRICKLE DOWN ON ALL THE WAY

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.095
DOWN TO THE TO THE BOOTS. AND

00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:19.597
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO REACH

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:21.532
THOSE AND ONE THING ONLY WE'RE

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.266
GOING TO DO THAT ON THE WAY

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:23.834
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO OPEN OUR

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:25.302
DOORS OR THEIR DOORS TO US AND

00:38:25.369 --> 00:38:26.737
LISTEN TO US. KNOW THAT WE'RE

00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:28.372
HERE TO EDUCATE THEIR WILL TO

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:30.307
MAKE CHANGE POSITIVE. OF COURSE

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:32.143
FINES ARE PART OF WHAT WE'RE

00:38:32.209 --> 00:38:34.278
GONNA DO BUT I REALLY I THE ONE

00:38:34.345 --> 00:38:36.147
OF THE REASONS THAT I'M- I WAS

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:37.815
PROUD TO BE SERVE ON THIS

00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:38.749
BORDERS SO I REALLY WANT TO

PRACTICES THAT'S PART OF THE

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:23.447
CURRICULUM IS A GIVEN BUT.

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:25.616

CUP- MEANS THAT THAT TALK ABOUT

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:43.567
AND I THINK NUMBER DEL TORY

00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:46.770
WITH FIRST THE SAME THAT. IN

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:48.772
JUST EXIT SURVEYS OF THE EIGHT

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.574
MOST LEADING INDICATE. ON THE

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:54.078
LOW. COURSE IS DO THEY VIOLATE

00:41:54.144 --> 00:42:10.127
AGAIN THE REAL. REAL SUCCESS.

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:12.329
BETWEEN THE SURVEY RESPONSE AND

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:16.600
THE. THE RESULT OF WHETHER IT

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:19.036
MIGHT COME BACK FOR THE BOARD

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:20.104
HAS A VIOLATION- WE'RE NOT

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:24.842
EXACTLY SURE ABOUT. IT'S

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:25.442
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:29.380
FIGURE OUT. IT IS ALWAYS NO NO

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:32.716
ONE IS THAT. TRAFFIC ALL SURE

00:42:32.783 --> 00:42:38.289
THAT STOPS YOU. IF THAT WEREN'T.

00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:42.760
IT'S EFFECTIVE TO A POINT. BUT

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:49.166
TENDS TO THINK LONGER WE HAVE

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:49.800
IT MARKED AS A NATION AND I'M

00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:50.434
BRINGING THAT EXPERIENCE IS ONE

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:52.569
OF THE REASON I'M ON THE SPORT.

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:53.971
MEASURE OF. METHODS THAT ARE

EFFECTIVE. SO WE'LL BE BRINGING

00:42:55.439 --> 00:43:00.678
SOME OF THOSE. YEARS OF STEP IN

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:01.211
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WE'RE

00:43:01.278 --> 00:43:17.061
LOOKING

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:18.829
SOME- WE HAVEN'T QUITE DEEPLY

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:22.666
RIGHT NOW WE'RE MIDDLE OF THE

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.002
INFRASTRUCTURE ON THIS PROGRAM.

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.903
THERE ARE METHODS THAT ARE

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:26.904
EFFECTIVE AND I LOOK FOR TO

RIGHT NOW GAS INCIDENTS ABOUT A

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:40.651
HUNDRED. INVESTIGATORS ARE. THE

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:42.419
NICE PART OF THIS BOARD IS

00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:46.657
THAT. EVEN OUR LIGHTING METRICS

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:47.257
TEND TO BE LEADING WORDING IS

00:43:47.324 --> 00:43:49.893
TO- OTHER AGENCIES BECAUSE

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.861
WE'RE NOT JUST THEIR WHEN

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:57.601
SOMETHING BLOWS UP. SO. IT'S

00:43:57.668 --> 00:44:01.305
ALSO PART OF. THE ONLY REASON

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:04.641
REALLY BE EDUCATION FIRST IS

00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:06.877
BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING OUT

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:07.578
THERE AND ARE BEHAVING

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:08.212
ACCIDENTS THAT DON'T SHOW OF

00:44:08.278 --> 00:44:11.515
OTHER AGENCIES. IF WE WERE

00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:12.016
EDUCATION FIRST AND ONLY

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:16.353
INVESTIGATED. CAN ACCIDENTS

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:16.954
HERE I THINK YOU PROBABLY CALL

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:22.026
US BACK. RIGHT PROBABLY

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:24.194
THROUGH- DO YOU FOR THIS THE

00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:27.831
ASIAN IN LIEU OF FINDS. DO YOU

00:44:27.898 --> 00:44:29.466
FIND A CURE FOR SEE ANY OF THE

00:44:29.533 --> 00:44:33.170
AGENCIES THAT INFO ASHRAFI I'M

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:35.205
ASKED THEM LETTER TO BUT- SEE

00:44:35.272 --> 00:44:39.109
THAT IS A POSSIBLE. IN THIS

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:42.179
SPACE AND MY EXPERIENCE THERE'S

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:43.380
A HUGE GAP BETWEEN OKAY WE

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:47.051
FOUND A VIOLATION OR AN EVENT

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:51.655
AND THEN HERE'S THE PUNISHMENT.

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:55.192
AND OF THAT SPACE WELL AS. THAT

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:56.093
THERE WAS NO INVESTIGATION TO

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.330
BRING TO SAY- IS AVAILABLE BUT

00:45:00.397 --> 00:45:04.935
NO IS DOING SUGGESTION. IN A

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:07.871
LOTTERY TAX I THINK OUR

00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:08.472
AGENCIES THUS FAR HAVEN'T HAD

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:13.777
THE TOOL. TO DO PROACTIVE

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:14.278
SAFETY EDUCATION CULTURE

00:45:14.344 --> 00:45:20.851
FOCUSED. BUT I THINK IT WILL

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:22.252
WHAT'S THEY START GETTING TOOLS

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:23.554
FOR INSTANCE OR ITS DEVELOPMENT

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:28.358
OF THIS EDUCATION LOW FINANCE

00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:29.259
COURSE THE MATERIAL THAT. BOARD

00:45:29.326 --> 00:45:32.863

THINK IT'S BEEN A OF COOL

00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:38.735
THAT'S HAMSTRUNG THEM MORE THAN

00:45:38.802 --> 00:45:42.272
NECESSARY A. DIFFERENCES IN

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:45.309
MINES THAT THE LACK CREATED

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:50.280
THAT DIFFERENCE. THE

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:52.649
DISTRIBUTOR WELL WANTED. WHO

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:55.786
RESOURCES WITHIN THE AGENCY AND

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:56.753
AS I LOOK THROUGH THE

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.022
LEGISLATIVE REPORT IT IN

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:01.258
LOOKING AT THE FINANCES AND THE

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:03.060
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS ON THE

INFORMATION PROVIDED IT IS IT'S

00:46:04.862 --> 00:46:10.267

DEFICITS THAT THE OUR PRESIDENT

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:49.373
MAKES A CASE FOR WHY THE

00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:04.221
POINT. WHETHER THERE ARE SOME.

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:05.922
TYPES OF VIOLATIONS THE THINGS

I'VE NOTHING YET. I THINK IT

00:52:24.841 --> 00:52:28.111
WOULD HELP. THE COMMITTEES ARE

00:52:28.178 --> 00:52:30.180

LOOKING AT THE SOME OF THE

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:01.778

CALIFORNIA IF YOU THE BARRIERS

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:08.218
THAT ARE IN STATURE TODAY THAT

SHOULD BE. TO OTHER STATES THE

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.542

PERCENTAGE OF WHICH IS. BY

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:12.915
TAKING IN MANY. NOW DOWN INTO

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:14.517
THE TWENTIES. AS FAR THE

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:17.453
PERCENTAGES ARE TWENTY A LOT

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.521
FOR THE PAST REGION'S AND-

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:22.325
THOUGH WE ARE LAGGING BEHIND

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:22.959
AND I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:26.229
HAS BEEN. THAT. EXIST WE'VE

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:30.933
RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE SO BIG AND

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:31.567
SO POPULOUS THAT WE WOULD NEED

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:34.704
AN ARMY OF ON THEIR OWN PEOPLE

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:35.838
DOING IT CATIA AND NOT JUST NOT

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:38.374
REALISTIC FROM OF. USE AND TRY

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:40.042
AND I'M NOT SAYING WE HAVEN'T

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:41.544
TRIED BUT WE HAVE INVESTED LIKE

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:45.748
A STATE HAVE INVESTED IN TERMS

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:46.349
TEAMS OF PEOPLE AND- YOU KNOW

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:50.519
THE. WE DEVELOPED AN ONLINE

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:51.954
TRADING PLATFORM WE SPENT SIX

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:52.688
MONTHS TWO. THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:55.291
IT TAKES THREE HOURS FOR THE

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:57.827
USER TO COMPLETE AND WE THINK

01:04:57.893 --> 01:04:58.427
THAT WOULD BE A VERY THOROUGH.

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.129
EDUCATIONAL TOOL TO REQUIRE

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:02.365
EXCAVATOR DO. OF THE STATE OF

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:07.536
NEW YORK FOR EXACT I HAD A

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:08.170
RECENTLY PASSED A LAW REQUIRING

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:10.406
ALL THEIR. THROUGH THERE ONE

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:13.109
CALL CENTERS. AND THEY'VE DONE

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:17.546
TWENTY THE NEXT. SO FAR SO IT'S-VERY IMPRESSIVE WHAT THEY'RE

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:19.081
AND IT'S VERY THOROUGH AS

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:21.284
OPPOSED TO- POTENTIALLY A

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.252
COUPLE QUESTIONS ON YOUR

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:26.689
LICENSING TESTED THAT ARE UP

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.824
FOR MIDDLE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:29.425
RELATED TO BEING A- CONTRACTOR

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:33.996
IS THE- FOCUSED ON SPECIFICALLY

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:36.232
FOR YOU TAKE PROCESS. THAT

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:39.568
COULD BE A TARGET WORK TOWARD-

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:42.905
HOWEVER- I THINK THE DIXIE

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:43.873
BORDERS MAKING GOOD PROGRESS

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:47.143
BUT I THINK THERE ARE A FEW KEY

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:48.544
WORDS IN STAFF THAT ARE GOING.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.781
TO MAKE IT IGNORE- FOR EXAMPLE

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:57.553
WE HAVE EXEMPTIONS THAT ALLOW-

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.087
CERTAIN FOR THE OPERATORS

01:05:58.154 --> 01:06:01.424
OPERATIVES PATE. BASED ON WHAT

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:04.560
THE UNDERGROUND. OR WHO THEY

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:05.961
ARE IF THAT CLOUT IN THE- IN

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:07.430
THE POLITICAL ARENA THEY'RE

01:06:07.496 --> 01:06:09.899
ABLE TO SAY WE DON'T NEED TO

01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:14.737
SPEAK. AND SPELL OUT. SO KEEPS

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:15.738
WERE EXCAVATED DON'T HAVE TO

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:19.575
GET BEFORE THEY DIG MOST

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:20.376
NOTABLY MARIANNA BEING A GREAT

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:22.044
EXAMPLE WHERE ALL CONTRACTORS

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:22.611
WORKING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:25.848
THE OLD. AMBER SITUATIONS THERE

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:26.849
THAT OTHER STATES HAVE SOLVED

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:33.522
THROUGH- LEGISLATIVELY.

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:35.491
ENFORCEMENT BEING FRACTURED

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:37.259
PEOPLE AGENCIES THAT'S NOT A

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:41.063
COMMON IN OTHER STATES. MANY

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.431
STE AGENCY IT DOESN'T ALL WORK

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:45.267
HERE WERE AMONG FOR AGENCIES

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:48.304
AND THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:50.806
THOSE FOR AS BEEN. OPTIMAL OVER

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:53.075
THE YEARS I WOULD SUSPECT IN

01:06:53.142 --> 01:06:56.345
JUST NOW ORDERED AND SO IF WE

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:56.946
WANT TO CATCH UP QUICKLY THAT

01:06:57.012 --> 01:07:01.050
NEEDS TO HAPPEN. IMAGES BRING

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:04.387
UP ABOUT THAT ALREADY I AM

01:07:04.453 --> 01:07:09.225
CRITICAL OF THE DIG SAFE WORDS-

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:09.792
RECOMMENDATION OF REPORTING

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:12.228
DAMAGES BECAUSE EVEN STEP INTO

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:14.530
ONLY REQUIRE REPORTING OF WHAT

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:15.398
YOU MIGHT CALL HIGH PRIORITY

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:18.100
DAMAGES IF THAT WAS YOUR INJURY

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:21.070
OR IT WAS A GAS OR SOMETHING

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:22.371
SIGNIFICANT THAT WILL BE

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:27.410
HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE DON'T EVEN

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:29.412
KNOW HOW MANY DIFFERENCES ARE

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:30.012
OCCURRING OF WE DON'T REQUIRE

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:32.782

HE SAW THE PROBLEM OF. THE

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:36.218
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM FIRST AND

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:39.088
I IT'S NOT GOOD POLICY TO SAY

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:39.655
WELL WE'LL JUST FOCUS ON THE

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:41.190
LIGHT TO FIND OUT. EVERYTHING

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.229
ELSE RUN BEGINNING AND THEN WE

01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:49.498
CAN DECIDE TO EDUCATE

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.066
ACCORDINGLY BUT I THINK WE NEED

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:52.201
A FIRST OF ALL I RECOMMEND THAT

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:54.570

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:34.503
INSPECTIONS OF WE DO. HAVE FOR

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:40.108
OPERATORS A. PROGRAMS THERE

01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:41.643
THERE CERTAINLY ALL THIS FOR

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:44.713
IMPROVEMENTS BUT- SO WE DO LOOK

01:19:44.779 --> 01:19:45.514
AT THOSE AS PART OF OUR

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:48.450
INSPECTION I TO DETERMINE- WHAT

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:50.919
THE UTILITY OFFERS AND FILTERS.

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:54.723
AS PART OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND.

01:19:54.789 --> 01:19:55.323
AND THAT'S CRITICAL YOU CAN'T

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:59.427
CATCH IT YOU SINGLE OUT. TO

01:19:59.494 --> 01:19:59.928
FIND THOSE ISSUES WHEN I

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:02.531
CREATED AND- MARIETTA- INCIDENT

WAS MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:04.933
AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.034
WE'VE INVESTIGATED THAT STILL

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:09.337
OPEN- IN BUT EARLY INDICATIONS

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:11.506
IT'S NOT A UTILITY OPERATIONS

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:13.708
FOR PRACTICE OR ISSUE THIS IS

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:14.743
CERTAINLY A CASE OF SOMEBODY

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:17.279
HADN'T CALLED IN THE TICKET.

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:19.714
AND WE KNOW THERE'S- PROCESS

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:21.049
UNDER WAY TO YOU KNOW CHANGE

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:22.250
THAT AND HOPEFULLY ADDRESS THE

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:23.952
GROUNDING ISSUES AND- BUT YOU

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:24.819
KNOW IT'S NOT JUST SOLAR

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:25.987
COMPANIES THAT DO GROUNDING

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:27.822
RODS AND SO IT IT A LOT OF

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:29.090
ENTITIES MAYBE. MAY HAVE THAT

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:30.926
AFTER ASPECTS OF IT IT REALLY

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:31.493
BE SHOULD BE SOMETHING

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.162
UNDERSTOOD BY EVERYONE- ANY

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:35.630
ROUNDING CAN HAVE THAT SAME

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:37.966
KIND OF IMPACT SO. ARE IT'S NOT

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:39.868
A UTILITY ISSUE DOESN'T APPEAR

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:42.070
TO BE A UTILITY VIOLATION ISSUE

01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:42.704
AT THIS STAGE BUT IT CERTAINLY

01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:45.407
DOES HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT.

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:49.010

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:54.983
THE REQUIREMENTS ARE. AS FAR AS

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:55.617
THE EDUCATION AND

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:58.153
OPPORTUNITIES. AND THE OUTREACH

01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:59.354
PROGRAMS THE BOARD IS PUTTING

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:02.257
TOGETHER WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:02.857
WITH CARGO FOR MANY YEARS WE

01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:04.759

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:07.195
IS DEVELOPED A LOT OF PROGRAMS.

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:08.430
THIS CERTAINLY HAVE VALUE THEY

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:09.698
REALLY NEED TO BE CONSIDERED.

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:13.435
ARE AND THE COMMISSION ITSELF

01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:14.035
DOES PUBLIC AWARENESS EFFORTS

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:16.972
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AND SO WE

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:17.706
DO OUR PART AND OF COURSE WE

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:18.840
REQUIRE THE UTILITIES PROVIDE

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:20.609
THE MESSAGES RELATED TO A ONE

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:22.477
ONE AND THE ONE CALL. SO THAT'S

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:23.778

01:21:30.385 --> 01:21:31.152
FOR OPPORTUNITY WHERE HOW. WE

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:32.687

I KNOW THE SENSITIVITY AROUND

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.595
THE ISSUE OF P. GENIES.

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:48.570
ONGOING END. I THINK WE'RE ALL

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:50.739
AWARE OF THE SETTLEMENT THAT

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:51.339
HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE TWO.

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:56.978
BY THE- INTERESTED PARTIES- AND

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:57.579
I HAVE TO SAY THAT IN LOOKING

AT THAT. SIXTY FIVE MILLION

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:02.484

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:03.685
PENALTY AND SIXTY MILLION

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.820
DOLLARS WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:06.454
DO THE WORK IF THEY'VE ALREADY

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:08.089
BEEN REQUIRED TO DO AND PAY

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:10.792

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:16.804
COUPLE MONTHS WE'VE HAD A

01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:18.139
REALLY HISTORIC. MONTHS AND

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:21.943
EVEN DAYS WERE YOU RECEIVE UP

TO SEVEN THOUSAND TICKETS IN

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:23.044
ONE DAY THAT WE'VE HAD TO

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:27.015
RESPOND TO. SO WE'RE SEEING

01:26:27.081 --> 01:26:28.283
THAT. THE THINGS THAT ARE ARE

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:28.917
BEING DONE THERE STARTED SLOWLY

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:31.452
TAKE A FACT. AND ONE THING THAT

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:33.888
WE WANT TO FOCUS IN ON IS COULD

01:26:33.955 --> 01:26:34.556
STILL GETTING A GREATER

01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:36.291
AWARENESS OF CALL ANYONE WANT.

01:26:36.357 --> 01:26:39.093
TO BE IN A GIVEN GIVEN OPERATE

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:39.727
OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT THERE AND

01:26:39.794 --> 01:26:42.931
LOOK AT THEIR FACILITIES. ALSO

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:43.565
IF THAT SOMETHING THAT'S NEEDED

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:45.033
THAT. WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY

01:26:45.099 --> 01:26:48.603
WITH. THE BOARD- THE COMMISSION

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:49.704

STATE EXCAVATION PRACTICES WE

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:57.045
WANT TO FOR THE FORTHCOMING.

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:57.879
ANOTHER KEY ELEMENT OF THIS IS

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:58.746
REALLY STRENGTHENING WE HAVE AN

01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:00.181
OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHENING

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:03.184
THE GOVERNMENT CODE FORTY TWO

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:03.785
SIXTEEN WHICH IS ANOTHER AREA

01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:04.519
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:07.555
PROVIDING OUR- ADDED CLARITY

01:27:07.622 --> 01:27:08.189

AND THERE'S SOME GAPS. AND ONE

01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:12.427
OF THINGS THAT WE DO LOOK FOR

01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:13.995
TO IN THE FUTURE IS THE GREATER

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:15.763
ENFORCEMENT- AND GREATER

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:17.265
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS- BECAUSE WE

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:19.667
DO SEE. THERE IS EXCAVATORS

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:21.836
THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT HOLD

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.371

LOT OF TRAFFIC THE CAN BE

ALWAYS AN OPERATION AROUND THE

HOLES A LOT OF THINGS TO PAY

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:38.780
ATTENTION TO AND IN FACT OUR

OSHA REQUIREMENTS IN AND

KNOW. ONCE THE CALL IS MADE-

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:02.070
THERE'S A LOT OF FACILITIES

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:02.870
THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:04.972
TYPICALLY TO IN IN THE GROUND.

01:29:05.039 --> 01:29:06.007
WE'RE NOT JUST DEALING WITH ONE

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:07.442
OR TWO- INFRASTRUCTURE

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:10.311
OPERATORS WE HAVE MULTIPLE- AND

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:11.879
I CAN BE MULTIPLE FACILITIES

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:14.749
FROM A SINGLE- UTILITY OPERATOR

01:29:14.816 --> 01:29:17.585
AS WELL SO I EVEN IF WE HAVE

01:29:17.652 --> 01:29:19.987
CORRECT MARKINGS. THOUGH IT

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:21.222
WHICH THOSE MARQUEES PROVIDE

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:22.690
THE ITEM OUT FOR US GOING IN

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:23.958
AND SOMETIMES THOSE MARKINGS

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:25.393
CAN BE A I WON'T PICK ANY ONE

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.427
FACILITY BUT I'LL SAY ONE

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:28.129
MARKING IDENTIFYING ON AN

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.831
ORANGE DELICATE TELECOM OR

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:33.267
SOMETHING LIKE THAT- CAN WE

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:39.273
FIND AS WE GO INTO. THE WHOLE

01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:45.713
REPRESENT LAYERED FACILITIES.

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:46.948
WE FIND ONE BUT THEN THERE'S

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:47.782
TWO OR THREE BELOW THAT IS YOU

01:29:47.849 --> 01:29:48.516
GO FURTHER AND- AND WHAT'S

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:49.083
REALLY KEY HERE IN THE POINT

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:49.684
I'M TRYING TO MAKE WITH THIS.

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:50.785
IS OUR EXPERIENCE CONTRACTORS-

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:51.352
WHEN THEY SEE THIS TYPE OF

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:52.487
THING THE THEY TAKE EXTRA

01:29:52.553 --> 01:29:53.221
PRUDENT STEPS TO LOOK AT MAN

01:29:53.287 --> 01:29:54.055
HOLES. THAT THAT ARE AROUND THE

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:55.089
FACILITY ARE OTHER CONNECTIONS

01:29:55.156 --> 01:29:56.924
THAT EXIST FOR POLLS OR OR

01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:58.192
UTILITY BOXES THAT THAT EXISTS

01:29:58.259 --> 01:29:59.794
TO MAKE SURE THEY VERIFY.

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.362
OUTSIDE OF THOSE MARKINGS THAT

01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:02.296
THEY'RE WORKING WITH IN THE

01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:03.431
CORRECT PARAMETERS AND THERE

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:06.768
AREN'T HIDDEN- FACILITIES BOTH.

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:08.436
BELOW THE GROUND NOW YOU KNOW

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:12.306
WITH THAT SAID- WE STILL HAVE A

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:13.341
CHALLENGE WITH THE MARKINGS

01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:15.243
COMING AND INCOMPLETE-

01:30:15.309 --> 01:30:18.045
INCORRECT. OR JUST FLAT MISSING

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:18.646
AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:20.214
IMPORTANT STEPS TAKEN NATIONAL

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:21.849
LEGISLATURE WITH ELEVEN SIXTY

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:23.684
SIX- WHICH REQUIRES WITH

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:24.819
ELECTRON POSITIVE RESPONSE

01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:26.254
WHICH IN FACT IF WE'RE-

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.855
RESPECTING FIVE MARKINGS WE'VE

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:29.891
GOT THREE OR FOUR. A WE DON'T

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:31.159
HAVE A SITUATION WE COUNTER

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:32.393
BEFORE WE DON'T KNOW. THE

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:33.895
UTILITY ACTUALLY HAS A FACILITY

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:34.629
IN THE GROUND AND THEY HAVE ANY

01:30:34.695 --> 01:30:35.997
KNOWLEDGE THEY DO OR DON'T

01:30:36.063 --> 01:30:37.031
WE'RE JUST STANDING THERE KIND

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:38.065
OF WAITING GOING- IS IT YOU

01:30:38.132 --> 01:30:39.801
KNOW WE'RE OVERDUE BUT DO WE GO

01:30:39.867 --> 01:30:41.035
AND HIT AND THAT'S- YOU KNOW

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:45.139
NOT A SAFE. PRACTICE SO. I YOU

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:51.612
KNOW THAT I WILL SAY. THIS SB

01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:52.213
SIX SIX ONE THE EXCAVATOR AN

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.014
OPERATOR COMMUNITY HAD A VERY

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:53.648
CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP. ENDED

01:30:53.714 --> 01:30:54.282
BUILT OVER THAT BUILT UP OVER

01:30:54.348 --> 01:30:56.450
DECADES AND IN LARGE PART THAT

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:57.285
RESULTED FROM JUST A LACK OF

01:30:57.351 --> 01:30:58.085
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWO

01:30:58.152 --> 01:31:00.621
PARTIES. AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING

01:31:00.688 --> 01:31:01.222
WAS EXCAVATORS ARE GOING ABOUT

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:03.591
THEIR NORMAL BIT. OPERATION AND

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:06.627
OF BUSINESS AND INCIDENCES ARE

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:09.697
HAPPENING- BUT THE OPERATORS

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:10.264
WAR RATHER THAN FINDING OUT

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:14.235
THESE THE. THE GUY WHAT WAS

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:14.735
HAPPENING AROUND THOSE

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:15.670
INSTANCES WERE JUST

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:17.038
AUTOMATICALLY INVOICING

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:18.739
CONTRACTORS WERE TAKING THEM TO

01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:20.007
COURT TOO WE DIDN'T TAKE THE

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:21.275
NUMBERS ATIONS AGAIN AND THEY

01:31:21.342 --> 01:31:22.476
WERE VERY AGGRESSIVE IN WITH NO

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:24.478
REAL BASIS ULTIMATELY AND NO

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:26.047
REAL MEASURE FOR WHY THE

01:31:26.113 --> 01:31:27.081
INVOICES WERE WHAT THEY WOULD

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:29.116
BE AND SO I AM HAPPY TO REPORT

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:30.885
THAT SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:32.520
MADE GREAT STRIDES WITH A

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:33.921
NUMBER OF OPERATORS. IN OUR

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:35.523
ABILITY TO GET CORRECT AND

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:37.058
CURRENT CONTACT INFORMATION FOR

01:31:37.124 --> 01:31:37.859
THE FIELD REPRESENTATIVE

01:31:37.925 --> 01:31:40.027
REPRESENTS AN AREA IF WE HAVE A

01:31:40.094 --> 01:31:41.562
PROBLEM OR CRISIS HOW WE GET

01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:42.563
ALL OF THEM QUICKLY AND GET

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:44.498
QUICK FAST RESPONSES AND THE

01:31:44.565 --> 01:31:46.500
LIKE SO THAT THAT HAS BEEN-

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:47.902
TRULY- SOMETHING WE'VE NOTICED

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:50.071
A GREAT CHANGE AND- OTHER OTHER

01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:51.272
CHALLENGES OF EXPERIENCE IN THE

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:52.807
WHOLE ABANDONED LINES THERE IS

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:53.674
A PROVISION OR THEY HAVE TO

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:55.543
MARK ABANDON LINES NOW BUT WE

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:56.944
FOUND THAT ONCE WE GET IN THERE

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:58.546
AND FIND ONE. OFTENTIMES OF THE

01:31:58.613 --> 01:31:59.780
OP NONE OF THE OPERATORS WILL

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:01.415
CLAIM THAT LINE AND THEN WE

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:02.917
HAVE NO WAITED TO VERIFY IT

01:32:02.984 --> 01:32:04.285
THAT'S A LIVE LINE OR IF IT'S

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:05.152
IN A BAND ACTUALLY IS OF AN

01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:06.487
ABANDONED LINE HOW TO PROCEED

01:32:06.554 --> 01:32:08.222
WITH THAT AND YOU END UP WITH

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:10.791
WITH DELAYS AND DELAYS DELAYS

01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:13.027
AN EXCAVATION AND I DO THINK I

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:14.428
FEEL I SHOULD GO INTO THE INTO

01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:16.063
DELAYS BECAUSE- THEY CAN BE

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:16.764
CATASTROPHIC FOR SMALL

01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:17.698
EXCAVATORS AND SMALL

01:32:30.611 --> 01:32:31.512
HAVE YOU HAVE MONEY GOING OUT

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:33.314
THE WINDOW IT IS TIME GOES BY

OF DOLLARS UP TO MILLIONS OF

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:49.497
DOLLARS PER DAY THAT THOSE

PROJECTS GO OVER SO THAT CAN

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:54.235
BE- AS EXTREME CHALLENGE AND WE

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:55.469

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:56.203
EXCAVATOR IN A SITUATION WHERE

01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:58.873

01:32:58.940 --> 01:32:59.640
ON THE SUBJECTED FINANCIAL

01:32:59.707 --> 01:33:01.208
IMPACT IT COULD HAVE OVER THE

PRACTICES IN THE WHOLE SO

01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:05.846
THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK AT TO-

01:33:05.913 --> 01:33:06.580
ANOTHER THING WE WERE

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:07.481

DIFFERENCES WITH OPERATORS IN

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:02.303
THE CAN BE A NEUTRAL GROUND

01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:03.471
WHERE WE CAN MEDIATE THROUGH

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:05.306
THOSE THOSE DIFFERENCES AND

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:07.341
PROBLEMS AND COME TO SOLUTIONS

THE STATE THERE'S SUCH A- VAST.

01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:24.925
AB EVERYBODY CAN BE AS COMMUTER

01:34:24.992 --> 01:34:26.694
AT SOME POINT AND JUST GETTING

01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:27.828
THE WORD OUT THIS. IS CAN BE

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:29.697
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SO. I IN

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:30.965
GETTING YOU KNOW IT WAS

01:34:31.032 --> 01:34:32.066
MENTIONED EARLIER GETTING

01:34:32.133 --> 01:34:32.933
INFORMATION BACK TO THE

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.668
OPERATORS TO IF WE EXPERIENCE

YOU'LL FIND CASES WHERE WE COME

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:37.304
ACROSS THERE'S THEIR

01:34:37.371 --> 01:34:39.073
FACILITIES. AND THERE ARE NEXT

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:40.041
THAT ARE ALREADY THERE ARE

01:34:40.107 --> 01:34:40.775
THERE'S PATCHES OR SOMETHING

01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:42.476
SOME OF YOUR REPORT BEFORE.

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:43.711
BEING ABLE TO SHARE THAT

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:44.812
INFORMATION BE PARTNERS IN THE

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:46.680
AND IN MAPPING THESE-

01:34:46.747 --> 01:34:48.582
FACILITIES IT MAY NOT BE SO YOU

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:50.284
KNOW MAYBE OLDER OR NOT- WELL

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:53.587
MAPPED- FOR IN THE PAST

01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:55.356
INSISTED THAT SUMMER Và. YOU

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:57.658
KNOW DECADES OLD UP IN MANY

01:34:57.725 --> 01:34:59.627
DECADES OLD- WITH THAT SAID

01:34:59.693 --> 01:35:00.428
THOUGH WE SHOULDN'T A COMMUTER

01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:04.832
SHOULD BE SEEN AS- IS LOCATORS-

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:06.634
OR- I SHOULD SAY. USES LOCATORS

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:07.935
BECAUSE WE HAVE WE DO SEE

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:10.638
INSTANCES WHERE LOCATED MARK

01:35:10.704 --> 01:35:12.873
WILL COME OUT AND- DESIGNATE IN

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.508
YEARS MARKET A LARGE AREA WITH

01:35:14.575 --> 01:35:16.177
QUESTION MARKS AND SAY DELIGHT.

01:35:16.243 --> 01:35:17.344
IN IN THE SENSE OF THEIR

01:35:17.411 --> 01:35:19.613
STARTING THAT THE EXCAVATOR.

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:20.581
NEEDS TO DAYLIGHT ALL

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:26.253
FACILITIES. ARE IN THAT THAT

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:26.854
ROUND. REGARDLESS OF IF THAT'S

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:32.726
IN CONFLICT. WITH THEIR THEIR

01:35:32.793 --> 01:35:33.794
ACTUAL EXCAVATION IN THAT'S

01:35:33.861 --> 01:35:34.762
ABUSE OF THAT. THAT POWER IN A

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:35.329
IN I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:35.930
THAT WE- NEED TO WORK THROUGH

01:35:35.996 --> 01:35:37.064
BUT IN IN THE WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:37.998
GET THE- THE- AS DRAW LINES-

01:35:38.065 --> 01:35:38.632
PLANS CORRECED WHERE THEY WERE

01:35:38.699 --> 01:35:39.700
BUILT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:40.334
AND WE SEE VARIANCES THAT COME

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:41.135
INTO PLAY AND- HAVE SAFELY BEEN

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:41.802
DISCOVERED AND- THAT'S WHERE WE

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:43.170
ARE KEY PARTNERS IN THIS. BUT

01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:44.839
AS I MENTIONED IS A STAR THIS

01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:46.173
EXAMINERS COME IN ALL SHAPES

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.142
SIZES AND PURPOSES. FOR MOST

01:35:48.209 --> 01:35:49.143
PART WE ARE THE LARGE MORE

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:51.045
SOPHISTICATED OPERATIONS BUT WE

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:51.946
ARE ALSO THE ONES WERE IN THE

01:35:52.012 --> 01:35:53.948
HOLES- THE EXPERIENCING THE

01:35:54.014 --> 01:35:55.549
MOST CHALLENGES WITH. WITH THE

01:35:55.616 --> 01:35:56.750
MOST FACILITIES AT ANY GIVEN

01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:59.286
TIME SO. I APPRECIATE THAT- THE

01:35:59.353 --> 01:36:00.454
OPPORTUNITY COME HERE TODAY AND

01:36:00.521 --> 01:36:02.389
AN OPEN ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:03.023
HAVE THANK YOU IF YOU ARE A AND

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:04.892
I DO HAVE ONE. THAT THE- WE

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:05.759
HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS

01:36:05.826 --> 01:36:08.129
WOULD. CENTERS FRESH IN MY MIND

01:36:08.195 --> 01:36:10.764
AND AFTER- YOUR PRESENTATION.

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:12.099
IN THIS CASE. IS SOMETHING WAS

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:14.335
REFLECTED IN THE- THE-

01:36:14.401 --> 01:36:18.472
COMMITTEE HEARING. SUBCOMMITTEE

01:36:18.539 --> 01:36:19.073
HEARING WE HAD AN BAKERSFIELD

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:22.409
AND A LOT OF THE. A LOT OF

01:36:22.476 --> 01:36:23.077
INFORMATION CAME TO LIGHT SOME

01:36:23.144 --> 01:36:23.611
OF THE ISSUES SOME OF THE

01:36:23.677 --> 01:36:24.345
PROBLEMS OF THE CHALLENGES

01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:24.945
BETWEEN THE CONTRACTOR AND THE

01:36:25.012 --> 01:36:26.413
OPERATOR THE UTILITIES. AND

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.550
THEN AFTER THAT- I. IN THE CITY

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:30.918
OF SAN BRUNO THEY'RE DOING A

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:32.453
GREAT SEPARATION ON THAT

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.155
CALTRAIN LINE AND- THERE WAS A

01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:37.858
DAY AGAIN- THE- EVACUATED- NO

01:36:37.925 --> 01:36:39.894
ONE WAS INJURED. THERE WAS NO.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:43.264
EXPLOSION OR FIRE- THEN- P.

01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:46.767
JEANNIE CAME OUT THERE THE

01:36:46.834 --> 01:36:47.268
PROVIDER AT THAT AT THAT

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:49.670
LOCATION. AND AS THEY WERE

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:50.437
STANDING THERE THE PEOPLE FROM-

01:36:50.504 --> 01:36:51.972
THE CALTRAIN THE EMPLOYEES WERE

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.841
STANDING OVER THE SITE AND

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:55.276
THERE WAS A- DEPUTY SHERIFF

01:36:55.342 --> 01:36:56.944
THAT IN THERE AND- THE P.

01:36:57.011 --> 01:36:59.980
JEANNIE FELLOW. WAS THERE ANY

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:00.581
TAKES HIS BREAK CANNOT STARTS

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:04.185
BRAIN IN THE WHOLE. BASICALLY

01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:05.352
TO ME IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS

01:37:05.419 --> 01:37:07.288
COVERED IN WHATEVER WAS GOING

01:37:07.354 --> 01:37:09.857
ON AND WAS MAYBE MIS MARKED AND%

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:11.525
TRYING TO CORRECT THAT THAT WAS

01:37:11.592 --> 01:37:12.660
AN ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED IN THE

01:37:12.726 --> 01:37:13.360
HEARING THAT WE HAD A

01:37:13.427 --> 01:37:15.029
BAKERSFIELD ONE TO THE OTHER

01:37:15.095 --> 01:37:18.165
ISSUE WAS THE MISS MARKING OF

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:19.633
THIS FROM SOME OF THE UTILITIES

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.736
AND- SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS

01:37:22.803 --> 01:37:24.471
DO YOU STILL FIND THAT AS A

01:37:24.538 --> 01:37:27.007
PROBLEM AND HOW EXTENSIVE IS

01:37:27.074 --> 01:37:29.944
IT- AND HAS THAT- SUBSIDED IN

01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:32.346
ANY ANYWAY SINCE- THE LAST FEW

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:34.248
YEARS. THE WITH REGARD TO THE

01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:35.416
FIRST POINT WHERE IF SOMEBODY

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:37.651
FOLLOWING UP WITH KIND OF AFTER

01:37:37.718 --> 01:37:39.286
THE FACT YEAH MARKINGS THAT IS

01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:40.387
SOMETHING WE ENCOUNTERED

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:43.090
REPEATEDLY EVEN A ROUTE BEFORE

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:44.592
AND AFTER THAT THAT INCIDENT

01:37:44.658 --> 01:37:46.060
AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:48.295
HAVE BEEN KIND OF A- I WAS A

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:49.230
COMMON PRACTICE BUT IT WAS

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:50.631
CERTAINLY SEEM BAD LUMBAR

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:51.999
MEMBER CONTRACTORS WE HAVEN'T

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:53.767
SEEN SO MUCH OF THAT AS OF LATE

01:37:53.834 --> 01:37:54.902
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMEWHAT

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:57.404
RESOLVED ITSELF IN IN- AS

01:37:57.471 --> 01:37:58.973
TIME'S GONE BY AND ENJOY

01:37:59.039 --> 01:37:59.974
AWARENESS TO THIS ISSUE IS

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.742
TAKING PLACE. AS FAR AS MISS

01:38:01.809 --> 01:38:03.077
MARKS ARE CONCERNED IT'S STILL

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:05.946
HAPPENING- NO MARKS MISS MARKS

01:38:06.013 --> 01:38:07.615
ALL OF THAT IT'S THERE IS A LOT

01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:09.683
OF VOLUME IN THE MARKS- THAT

01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:11.118
THE TO THE OPERATORS HAVE TO

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:13.587
MAKE- AND I KNOW THAT THE SOME

01:38:13.654 --> 01:38:15.089
OF THE DRAWINGS ARE OLDER BUT

01:38:15.155 --> 01:38:16.323
THERE ARE CASES WHERE THERE

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:18.259
BLATANT MISS MARKS AND WE'RE

01:38:18.325 --> 01:38:19.226
GOING IN AND REFINING

01:38:19.293 --> 01:38:20.427
FACILITIES WEREN'T EVEN NOTATED

01:38:20.494 --> 01:38:22.062
THAT WERE IN THE GROUND AND

01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:23.564
IT'S COMING DOWN AND TO DO

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:24.865
PRUDENCE ON THE EXTERIORS PART

01:38:24.932 --> 01:38:26.567
TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO JUST. YOU

01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:28.602
KNOW GO IN AND POSSIBLY STRIKE

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:32.206
THE UNKNOWN AS WELL SO- YES

01:38:32.273 --> 01:38:35.709
IT'S STILL HAPPENING- AGAIN-

01:38:35.776 --> 01:38:37.945
IT'S IT COMES DOWN TO US

01:38:38.012 --> 01:38:39.113
WORKING AS PARTNERS TO MAKE

01:38:39.179 --> 01:38:40.781
SURE WE COMPLETE THOSE RECORDS

01:38:40.848 --> 01:38:46.687
TO THE BEST WE CAN. UPDATE ALL

01:38:46.754 --> 01:38:52.126
RECORDS BUT ALSO YOU KNOW.

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:53.093
RECOGNIZING THAT THE OPERATORS

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.061
HAVE TO BE GOOD PARTNERS IN

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:54.662
GETTING THOSE TYPE MARKINGS

01:38:54.728 --> 01:38:55.296
TIMELY INCORRECT OR WE CAN

01:38:55.362 --> 01:38:55.896
MISTAKES HAPPEN IN ALL CASES.

01:38:55.963 --> 01:38:56.497
BUT THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:57.698
THEY JUST NOT BEING CAREFUL OR

01:38:57.765 --> 01:38:58.465
WE ARE SEEING- COMPANIES WERE

01:38:58.532 --> 01:39:00.000
AYE HIRING THIRD PARTY-

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:02.136
LOCATORS. THAT AREN'T. I WILL

01:39:02.202 --> 01:39:03.804
SAY SUFFICIENTLY TRAINED TO

01:39:03.871 --> 01:39:07.341
RECOGNIZE FACILITIES AND IN

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:07.975
SOME INSTANCES RESULT IN ERRORS

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:08.542
AND MARKINGS IN THAT CASE AS

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:13.614
WELL. THANK YOU- THE YES JOIN

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:15.149
DATE. COULD RAISE ADEQUATE NO

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:17.017
TO THAT- AT THE AT THE CALL%

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:18.085
CENTERS WE EXPERIENCE

01:39:18.152 --> 01:39:20.154
COMPLAINTS ABOUT MISS MARKS AND

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.890
NO MARKS LATE MARK'S DAILY MANY

01:39:22.956 --> 01:39:25.326
TIMES DAILY. AND ONE OF THE

01:39:25.392 --> 01:39:26.560
ISSUES THAT HAS BEEN ON MY

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:27.594
RADAR FOR AWHILE AND I'M NOT

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:29.430
SURE WHERE THE APPROPRIATE

01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:31.432
PLACE TO PUT THIS IN IS THAT.

01:39:31.498 --> 01:39:33.067
YOU KNOW SOME OF THIS IS A

01:39:33.133 --> 01:39:34.335
LIMITATION IN TECHNOLOGY THE

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:36.270
ACTUAL INSTRUMENTS TO

01:39:36.337 --> 01:39:37.905
PHYSICALLY DETECT WHERE THE

01:39:37.971 --> 01:39:40.374
FACILITIES ARE THERE THERE IS.

01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:41.408
IMPROVEMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:43.243
MADE IN THAT INDUSTRY BUT YOU

01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:44.645
KNOW THE FACILITY OPERATORS

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:46.513
THEY CAN'T HELP OUT UNTIL SOME

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:49.516
INVENTOR COMES UP WITH THE NEXT

01:39:49.583 --> 01:39:50.084
BIG THING TO ACTUALLY SOLVE

01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:53.854
THAT HOWEVER. THE RECORD

01:39:53.921 --> 01:39:54.488
KEEPING THAT MUST FAR AHEAD ON

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:56.423
IS KEY AND- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE

01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:59.393
A BEST PRACTICE WHERE. ALL NEW

01:39:59.460 --> 01:39:59.960
ALL FACILITIES WHEN THEY'RE

01:40:00.027 --> 01:40:05.466
EXPOSED. TO DAYLIGHT OUR GPS

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:07.000
MEANING ALL NEW INSTALLATIONS

01:40:07.067 --> 01:40:08.836
GET A RECORD BY GPS

01:40:08.902 --> 01:40:10.571
REPLACEMENTS RELOCATIONS

01:40:10.637 --> 01:40:12.573
REPAIRS EVERYTHING GETS DPS

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:14.375
BEFORE IT GETS BURIED THAT DOES

01:40:14.441 --> 01:40:15.843
NOT OCCUR NOW NOT BY A LONG

01:40:15.909 --> 01:40:17.411
SHOT NOT EVEN NEW INSTALLATIONS

01:40:17.478 --> 01:40:19.480
BRAND NEW STUFF IS BEING GPS.

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:20.514
SOME FACILITY OPERATORS WILL DO

01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:22.549
IT GOOD ONES BUT OTHERS WILL

01:40:22.616 --> 01:40:23.617
NOT DO IT UNLESS THEY'RE

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:24.618
REQUIRED IS INCLUDE

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:27.087
MUNICIPALITIES GAS COMPANIES

01:40:27.154 --> 01:40:29.723
TELECOM EVERY SECTOR. SO IF

01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:33.093
WE'RE GOING TO. MAKE PROGRESS

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:33.827
BEAT WITH ALL THESE LINES ARE

01:40:33.894 --> 01:40:37.498
BEING DISCOVERED- BY EXCAVATORS

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:38.799
ARE WE JUST GONNA BE CONTENT TO

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:40.467
LET THAT BE THE CASE THAT SOME

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:42.569
OF THE OVER THERE AND WE KNOW

01:40:42.636 --> 01:40:43.170
IT'S THERE BUT WE DON'T KNOW

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:43.737
WHERE AND WE'RE JUST GONNA

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:45.539
EXCEPT THAT FOREVER. THEN WE

01:40:45.606 --> 01:40:47.875
KEEP GOING AS BUSINESS AS USUAL

01:40:47.941 --> 01:40:49.209
BUT IF WE WANT TO HAVE THIS BE

01:40:49.276 --> 01:40:50.778
SOLVED IN TIME IS STILL GONNA

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:52.913
TAKE DECADES. BUT THE WE'VE GOT

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.848
TO GET STARTED AND THAT'S THE

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:56.250
EASIEST UP IS START WITH THE

01:40:56.316 --> 01:40:58.051
NEW INSTALLATIONS AND THEN THE

01:40:58.118 --> 01:40:59.620
REPAIR OBVIOUSLY CAN'T DIG

01:40:59.686 --> 01:41:00.854
EVERYTHING UP JUST THE MAP IT

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:02.856
BUT AS IT DOES GET DUG UP FOR

01:41:02.923 --> 01:41:04.491
OTHER PURPOSES REPAIR REPLACE

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:06.593
IT RELOCATE THAT'S WHEN THE GPS

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:08.629
IN OVERTIME. WE WILL HAVE GOOD

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:11.732
RECORDS SO THAT THAT NEEDS TO

01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:16.036
HAPPEN. THANK YOU FOR THAT. Và

01:41:16.103 --> 01:41:17.504
RIVERA WE JUST WANTED OFFER OUR

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:19.072
CONDOLENCES AND HOW SORRY WE

FAMILY'S AND OF STRUGGLING AND

01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:24.645

LEARNED FROM THAT EXPLOSION I

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:31.618
MEAN DID WE LEARN IN AND WHAT.

01:41:31.685 --> 01:41:33.120
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN

01:41:33.187 --> 01:41:35.322
DO OR SHOULD BE DONE

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:35.956
DIFFERENTLY TO PREVENT THOSE IN

01:41:36.023 --> 01:41:39.326
THE FUTURE. WELL A ELECTION YOU

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:40.561
MENTION- SALE MENTIONED EARLIER

01:41:40.627 --> 01:41:41.528
THE MEDIC MEDICATION STILL

01:41:41.595 --> 01:41:43.730
PENDING- BUT SOME OF A QUICK

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:46.099
THING THAT WE DID. I AM LOOKING

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:46.900
FOR OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW WE

01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:48.569
HAVE OUR PUBLIC WORDS CAMPAIGNS

01:41:48.635 --> 01:41:50.270
IT GOES OUT TO SPECIFIC

01:41:50.337 --> 01:41:52.473
EXCAVATORS. THAT WE HAVE SO.

01:41:52.539 --> 01:41:54.174
FROM THAT IN THE IMMEDIATE.

01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:56.310
AWARENESS WE REALIZE THAT WE

01:41:56.376 --> 01:41:57.311
WEREN'T TOUCHING A CERTAIN

01:41:57.377 --> 01:42:00.113
CATEGORY OF EXCAVATORS WHO TRY

01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:01.148
TO LOOK AT EXPANDING. A

01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:05.586
COMMUNICATION THAT GOES OUT-

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:06.153
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT AND IS

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:10.657
THAT SOMETHING THAT. MARGIE'S

01:42:10.724 --> 01:42:11.225
FROM THE DEPARTMENT CHEN IS

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:12.326
LIKE. HOW WHICH BOOK IS OUR

01:42:12.392 --> 01:42:12.993
MESSAGING TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.795
EXCAVATORS I'M COOLEY NORMALLY

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:15.996
HISTORICALLY WE HAVE WE'VE BEEN

01:42:16.063 --> 01:42:16.830
TRYING TO TARGET A SPECIFIC

01:42:16.897 --> 01:42:18.532
AUDIENCE. WE REALIZE THAT WE

01:42:18.599 --> 01:42:20.400
TARGET MULTIPLE AUDIENCES GOOD

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:21.602
MULTIPLE PEOPLE CAN BE

01:42:21.668 --> 01:42:22.870
EXCAVATORS WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:24.938
THEY'RE AWARE. OF HAVING TO

01:42:25.005 --> 01:42:26.573
CALL YOU ONE ONE OR THIS IS A

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.474
FREE SERVICE FOR THEM IT

01:42:27.541 --> 01:42:29.443
ACTUALLY CALL. AND LOOKING AT

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:30.544
BILLY THE LEGISLATION TO SEE

01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:32.145
WHERE WE'RE- WORKING WITH

01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:33.480
DRINKING THING TO KIND OF MAKE

01:42:33.547 --> 01:42:35.015
MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. NO ONE AREA

01:42:35.082 --> 01:42:36.517
THAT WE SAW. WITH THE

01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:38.118
GOVERNMENT CODE FORTY TWO

01:42:38.185 --> 01:42:39.052
SIXTEEN IS THE DEFINITION OF

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:40.921
EXCAVATION SOME PEOPLE HAVE.

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.789
THE REDEFINITION AND EXPLICITLY

01:42:42.856 --> 01:42:43.957
THINK THAT'S WHAT IS IT IF I'M

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:45.559
NOT DOING THIS NOT EXCAVATING

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:47.227
BUT IT'S REALLY. CAN FULLY

01:42:47.294 --> 01:42:48.562
UNDERSTAND THE TIME I'M I'M

01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:50.063
REALLY MOVING SOIL. THAT

01:42:50.130 --> 01:42:51.665
BECOMES AN EXCAVATION OBVIOUSLY

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:53.233
THERE'S SOME IMPLICATIONS OF

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.434
THAT WE WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:55.936
THAT AS WELL. THE BILL STOLE

01:42:56.003 --> 01:43:00.207
SOME OF. THINGS THAT WE STARTED

01:43:00.274 --> 01:43:00.774
LEARNING NOW AND IT WILL BE

01:43:00.841 --> 01:43:06.013
EXPANDING THAT AWARENESS. THANK

01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:07.581
YOU MISTER CHAUDHRY AND I'M AN

01:43:07.648 --> 01:43:08.715
ASPEN TOMORROW USE THAT AS WELL

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:09.583
AND IS THERE ANY. THINGS THAT

01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:10.284
WE'VE TAKE AWAYS FROM THAT

01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:11.151
THAT- WE CAN USE AS YOUR BEST

01:43:11.218 --> 01:43:12.319
PRACTICES OR WHAT WE SHOULD BE

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:13.320
DOING TO EDUCATE OR SOMETHING

01:43:13.387 --> 01:43:14.621
IN THE FUTURE. I THINK UP

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:17.324
PARTICIPATING WITH CARMEN AND-

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:18.825
IT CONTINUES TO BE THIS BIG

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:21.228
AREA ABOUT. ARE YOU KNOW

01:43:21.295 --> 01:43:22.696
WHETHER NOT PERMITS REQUIRED

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:24.598
FOR THE WORK AND WHAT AT WHAT

01:43:24.665 --> 01:43:25.866
POINT DOES THAT THEN GO TO ONE

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:27.367
A ONE ONE REQUIREMENT. HOW TO

01:43:27.434 --> 01:43:30.103
CALL. SO I THINK JUST. PERHAPS

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:32.673
A LOT MORE CLARITY ON THAT END.

01:43:32.739 --> 01:43:35.342
IN TERMS OF THE PERMIT AND THE

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:37.377
TYPE OF WORK BEING DONE- THAT

01:43:37.444 --> 01:43:39.146
THEN MOVES TO THE PHASE OF.

01:43:39.212 --> 01:43:40.414
YOUR DIGGING SOMEWHERE WHERE

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:41.081
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:43.050
UNDERNEATH. AND YOU NEED TO

01:43:43.116 --> 01:43:44.785
PULL A TICKET SO I THINK IT'S

01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:48.288
JUST A- IT IT IT STILL. TENDS

01:43:48.355 --> 01:43:49.089
TO BE AN AREA THAT THAT'S RIGHT

01:43:49.156 --> 01:43:51.458
BEFORE- BEFORE WE A LOT MORE

01:43:51.525 --> 01:43:53.961
CLARITY IN A LOT MORE. GUIDANCE

01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:55.529
TO FOLKS AND I THINK OUR GUYS.

01:43:55.596 --> 01:43:56.763
KIND OF TAKING IT ON AS AN ITEM

01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:58.465
I THINK IT'S AND ONE OF THE

01:43:58.532 --> 01:43:59.232
GROUPS LIKE I'M ON SO MANY

01:43:59.299 --> 01:44:00.434
DIFFERENT GROUPS I GET CONFUSED

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:02.869
BUT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT INTENT.

01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:04.838
WHAT COULD WE DO TO PROVIDE

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:06.173
MORE CLARITY OR OR SOME SORT OF

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:09.109
AN EASY. A PLACE FOR HOMEOWNERS

01:44:09.176 --> 01:44:10.243
AND OTHERS TO GO TO DON'T KIND

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:11.712
OF IDENTIFY OKAY I'M PLANNING A

01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:13.714
PLAN I DON'T NEED TO DO. I TAKE

01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:15.282
IT. BUT IF I'M PULLING A PERMIT

01:44:15.349 --> 01:44:16.650
THAT CERTAINLY MAKES IT A

01:44:16.717 --> 01:44:18.819
TICKET REQUIREMENTS- IN IN SO

01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:21.121
JUST. YOUNG WE COULD CERTAINLY

01:44:21.188 --> 01:44:22.255
WORK ON CLARIFYING THAT IN

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:23.957
MAKING THAT A LOT MORE KNOWN TO

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:25.359
EVERYBODY INVOLVED. THANK YOU

01:44:25.425 --> 01:44:26.660
AND IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:27.728
YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE DEBATING

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:29.229
THAT LEGISLATION ORIGINAL SIX

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:30.464
SIX ONE LEGISLATION THIS. CAME

01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:33.133
UP TO QUITE SOME EXTENT AND IT

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.668
WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT WE

01:44:34.735 --> 01:44:35.936
WEREN'T ABLE TO ADDRESS IT

01:44:36.003 --> 01:44:37.971
ULTIMATELY. IN THE END RESERVE

01:44:38.038 --> 01:44:39.139
BECAME TO HOMEOWNERS IN SOME

01:44:39.206 --> 01:44:40.841
INSTANCES LIKE THAT AND- TALK

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:42.075
ABOUT YEAR TALK ABOUT DRIVING A

01:44:42.142 --> 01:44:44.044
STAKE INTO THE GROUND AND- THAT

01:44:44.111 --> 01:44:45.445
CAN BE SIMILAR TO. A REAL

01:44:45.512 --> 01:44:46.680
ESTATE SIGN OR EAT ANYTHING

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:48.048
THAT'S COMMONLY MAYBE NOT

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:49.583
PROCEED AS AN EXCAVATION BUT

01:44:49.650 --> 01:44:50.217
YOU'RE GOING IN THERE ARE

01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:51.785
GROUND AND BECAUSE SUBJECT-

01:44:51.852 --> 01:44:55.055
EQUIPMENT TO DAMAGE SO- THERE'S

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:56.289
A LOT OF. YOU KNOW I THINK A

01:44:56.356 --> 01:45:04.431
LOT OF DISCUSSION THAT REMAINS.

01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:04.965
AROUND THIS THIS SUBJECT I

01:45:05.032 --> 01:45:09.670
THINK THAT THE GOOD. S.

01:45:09.736 --> 01:45:10.971
PRACTICES WOULD BE WARRANTED AT

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:12.072
SOME POINT BUT I DO THINK THERE

01:45:12.139 --> 01:45:13.440
WILL BE A GREAT DEAL OF WORK

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:13.940
AS- WHEN WE COME TO THE

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:14.408
REGARDING THE SUBJECT

01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:15.008
SPECIFICALLY. VERY GOOD THANK

ROBUST QUALITY ASSURANCE

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:18.011
PROGRAM IN PLACE. FROM WHAT I

01:45:18.078 --> 01:45:19.246
UNDERSTAND IN IT IT DISCOVERED.

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:20.313
THE LOCATE AND MARK ISSUES MANY

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:21.548
YEARS BEFORE THE CPC BROUGHT

01:45:21.615 --> 01:45:24.084
ITS CASE AGAINST THEM. OF A FOR

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:26.586
WHATEVER REASON THERE ARE

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:27.187
QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM WAS

01:45:27.254 --> 01:45:30.190
IGNORED. AND NOTHING HAPPENED

01:45:30.257 --> 01:45:30.757
WITH THAT IT HOW IS THIS THE

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:31.825
GENIE N SO CAL GAS PROMOTING

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:34.094
THE ISSUES RAISED BY THEIR A

01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:35.395
QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM.

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:37.631
WHILE IN JAIL ONE OF THE THINGS

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:38.832
THAT YOU KNOW WE STRONGLY FEEL

01:45:38.899 --> 01:45:40.801
CONFIDENT IS THAT WE HAVE- A

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:42.736
STRONG. A STRONG CULTURE THAT

01:45:42.803 --> 01:45:44.371
ALLOWS THE EMPLOYEE TO RAISE

01:45:44.438 --> 01:45:46.640
CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS.

01:45:46.707 --> 01:45:49.076
REGARDING TO THE EXTENT SUCH AS

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:50.210
YOU KNOW IF THEY DON'T FEEL

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:51.812
COMFORTABLE ON DOING SOMETHING

01:45:51.878 --> 01:45:52.579
AT THE AT THE HAVE THE EVERYONE

01:45:52.646 --> 01:45:53.680
HAS THE AUTHORITY TO STOP THE

01:45:53.747 --> 01:45:55.582
JOB. WHICH IS AND WHAT THAT

01:45:55.649 --> 01:45:56.817
MEANS IS YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT

01:45:56.883 --> 01:45:58.652
GONNA -CEED

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:00.053
SUPREMACY PERSPECTIVE UNTIL

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.488
THEY GET THE SUPPORT OR OF

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:02.889
KNOWLEDGE MEANT. THAT HE THEY

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:04.524
CAN MOVE FORWARD IN A SAFE

01:46:04.591 --> 01:46:08.195
MANNER. WITH THAT. IT ALLOWS US

01:46:08.261 --> 01:46:10.030
TO REALLY VALUE IS REALLY OVER

01:46:10.097 --> 01:46:11.298
THE COMMUNICATION LINES ALL THE

01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:13.033
WAY FROM THAT FRONTLINE EMPLOY.

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.234
ALL THE WAY TO OUR OUR

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:16.203
EXECUTIVES AT THE TOP LEVEL.

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.504
WHERE THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND

01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:18.905
NO KNOWLEDGE OF EMPLOYEES TO

01:46:18.972 --> 01:46:20.340
IDENTIFY WHEN THEIR SPECIFIC

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:22.275
ISSUES AND THEN. AS PART OF OUR

01:46:22.342 --> 01:46:23.744
AS FAR QUALITY ASSURANCE WERE

01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:25.278
MONITORING AND LIKE I MENTIONED

01:46:25.345 --> 01:46:26.613
BEFORE. YOU KNOW THOSE

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:27.881
SENTENCES WERE WERE AT FAULT

01:46:27.948 --> 01:46:29.549
WE'RE LOOKING AT WHERE IS

01:46:29.616 --> 01:46:30.383
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE CAN DO

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:32.252
WHETHER IT'S TRAINING FOR THAT

01:46:32.319 --> 01:46:33.620
EMPLOYEE TO GIVEN. THE RIGHT

01:46:33.687 --> 01:46:34.221
TRAINING THAT THEY HAVE THAT

01:46:34.287 --> 01:46:35.689
WHAT THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO TO

01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:37.657
DO. LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:39.426
HAVE FOR TOOLS COOLEY IS ALSO A

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:42.896
BIG ONE- TO MAKING IT HAPPEN TO

01:46:42.963 --> 01:46:44.030
A RECORD KEEPING TO MAKING SURE

01:46:44.097 --> 01:46:44.598
THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT RIGHT

01:46:44.664 --> 01:46:45.565
CORRECT RECORDKEEPING PROCESSES

01:46:45.632 --> 01:46:47.768
IN PLACE. TO ALSO LOOKING FOR

01:46:47.834 --> 01:46:48.335
LOOKING WHAT CAN WE DO TO

01:46:48.401 --> 01:46:50.203
PREVENT DAMAGES. YOU KNOW ONE

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:51.805
THING THAT WE STARTED DOING FOR

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:53.340
NEW INSTALLATIONS IS

01:46:53.406 --> 01:46:55.208
INSTALLING. ARE WE GONNA

01:46:55.275 --> 01:46:57.444
SELLING HIS WIRE MESH THE GOAL

01:46:57.511 --> 01:46:58.111
THE CROSSOVER HIGH PRIORITY

01:46:58.178 --> 01:47:00.647
LINES I'M IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:02.048
IT SERVES AS A DETERRENT. WHEN

01:47:02.115 --> 01:47:04.885
AN EXCAVATOR. ARM EXPOSES THE

01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:06.386
DISPLAY CAN ACTUALLY BACK WHOLE

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:08.889
GET CAUGHT ON BECAUSE AS MUCH

01:47:08.955 --> 01:47:11.525
ROBUST DEVICE. I'M SO WE WE'VE

01:47:11.591 --> 01:47:13.126
HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH THAT

01:47:13.193 --> 01:47:14.427
AND WE'VE NOW EXPORTS SPENDING

01:47:14.494 --> 01:47:16.663
THAT TO ALL OUR LINES. ON

01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:17.330
STARTING NEXT YEAR WILL BE

01:47:17.397 --> 01:47:18.632
UTILIZING THAT WIRE MESH WITH

01:47:18.698 --> 01:47:20.100
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:29.009
WAYS. TO LEVERAGE. AND PROMOTE

01:47:29.075 --> 01:47:39.486
DAMAGES WERE FACILITIES. PHONE

01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:41.688
IN THE ONLINE PORTAL YOU'VE

01:47:41.755 --> 01:47:43.757
REMOVED THE ABILITY TO ADD

01:47:43.824 --> 01:47:46.626
COMMENTS TO TICKET SUBMISSIONS.

01:47:46.693 --> 01:47:48.094
WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE OR

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:50.163
THINKING BEHIND THAT. SO THERE

01:47:50.230 --> 01:47:52.766
THERE ARE TWO FLAVORS TO

01:47:52.833 --> 01:47:55.435
CREATING TICKETS ONLINE. FIRST

01:47:55.502 --> 01:47:58.104
FIRST OF ALL WE PREFER TO

01:47:58.171 --> 01:47:59.739
CREATE THE TICKET ONLINE

01:47:59.806 --> 01:48:02.142
BECAUSE AS AWARENESS INCREASES

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:04.477
IN VOLUME INCREASES. WE DON'T

01:48:04.544 --> 01:48:07.280
WANT A LINEAR- CORRELATION TO

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:08.148
THE NUMBER OF CALL CENTER

01:48:08.215 --> 01:48:10.250
AGENTS THAT WE HAVE TO HIRE AS

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:11.484
THE VOLUME GOES UP WE DON'T

01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:12.752
WANT TO CONTINUE OUR STAFF TO

01:48:12.819 --> 01:48:13.553
GO THROUGH THE ROOF BECAUSE

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:15.455
UTILITY OWNERS FUND US AND

01:48:15.522 --> 01:48:17.524
THEREFORE THERE BILLS GO UP AND

01:48:17.591 --> 01:48:18.024
THEN BUILD SMALL MEMBERS

01:48:18.091 --> 01:48:19.826
COMPLAIN AND DON'T PARTICIPATE

01:48:19.893 --> 01:48:21.494
AND SO. WE TRY TO BE EFFICIENT

01:48:21.561 --> 01:48:22.963
BY DOING IT ONLINE THAT BEING

01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:26.333
SAID THERE ARE TWO FLAVORS ONE

01:48:26.399 --> 01:48:27.734
IS THE ONE IT'S FOR A SINGLE

01:48:27.801 --> 01:48:29.603
ADDRESS. SUCH AS A HOMEOWNER

01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:31.171
WORKING IN THEIR OWN YARD AND

01:48:31.238 --> 01:48:32.772
THAT ONE DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:35.141
TRAINING WE TRY TO HAVEIT BE-

01:48:35.208 --> 01:48:37.210
SELECT FROM THE DROP DOWN LIST

01:48:37.277 --> 01:48:38.211
YOU KNOW WHAT COUNTY ARE YOU

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.479
WORKING IN WHAT CITY WHAT'S

01:48:39.546 --> 01:48:40.747
YOUR ADDRESS WHAT PART OF THE

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:42.415
PROPERTY DO YOU WANT CHECK FOR

01:48:42.482 --> 01:48:43.450
UTILITIES AND THAT'S IT. IT'S

01:48:43.516 --> 01:48:46.820
JUST BASIC THEN FOR EXCAVATORS

01:48:46.887 --> 01:48:48.889
OF OTHER TYPES ANY OTHER THING

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:50.223
THAT'S MORE COMPLICATED AND

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:51.057
SOME OF THEM GET EXTREMELY

01:48:51.124 --> 01:48:52.559
COMPLICATED WE ACTUALLY GIVE

01:48:52.626 --> 01:48:53.960
THEM THE SAME SOFTWARE THAT OUR

01:48:54.027 --> 01:48:55.161
CALL CENTRE AGENTS USE AND

01:48:55.228 --> 01:48:56.696
TEACH THEM HOW TO USE IT. BUT

01:48:56.763 --> 01:48:59.366
IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND SO

01:48:59.432 --> 01:49:01.434
YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE THAT OPEN

01:49:01.501 --> 01:49:02.836
TO THE PUBLIC WITH NO TRAINING

01:49:02.903 --> 01:49:06.373
TO DO THAT SO WE FOUND THAT-

01:49:06.439 --> 01:49:08.975
PROFESSIONAL EXCAVATORS WERE-

01:49:09.042 --> 01:49:11.344
SNEAKING AROUND THE- DROPDOWN

01:49:11.411 --> 01:49:13.947
LIMITATIONS. BECAUSE WHAT WE

01:49:14.014 --> 01:49:16.216
WOULD HAVE A PLACE WAS- YOU

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:17.984
KNOW YOU'RE SINGLE ADDRESS ONE

01:49:18.051 --> 01:49:19.486
TWO THREE MAIN STREET AND THEN

01:49:19.552 --> 01:49:20.587
FOR WHAT PART OF THE PROPERTY

01:49:20.654 --> 01:49:23.056
DE WANT MARKED ENTIRE LOT FRONT

01:49:23.123 --> 01:49:25.458
REAR NORTH SOUTHEAST WEST. AND

01:49:25.525 --> 01:49:27.661
THEN WE HAVE ONE THAT WAS OTHER

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:28.962
AND THEN IN OTHER WE ENVISION

01:49:29.029 --> 01:49:30.297
THAT THEY WOULD SAY ALL I ONLY

01:49:30.363 --> 01:49:32.032
WANT A TEN FOOT RADIUS AROUND

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:33.099
THE MAILBOX BECAUSE I'M ONLY

01:49:33.166 --> 01:49:34.601
REPLACE THE MAILBOX AT ONLY MY

01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:36.403
WHOLE YARD MARKED I ONLY WANT

01:49:36.469 --> 01:49:37.938
THE MAILBOX. BUT WHAT WE WERE

01:49:38.004 --> 01:49:39.172
FIGHTING WITH THE CONTRACTORS

01:49:39.239 --> 01:49:41.174
WERE GOING IN OTHER AND THEN

01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:42.609
THEY WOULD TYPE OUT THIS LONG

01:49:42.676 --> 01:49:44.077
EXPLANATION ABOUT STARTED THIS

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:45.946
ADDRESS AND CONTINUE FOR THREE

01:49:46.012 --> 01:49:46.947
BLOCKS DOWN THE STREET AND THEN

01:49:47.013 --> 01:49:48.615
TURN RIGHT AND SO ON MEANWHILE

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:50.216
THE SYSTEM IS ONLY MAPPED IT

01:49:50.283 --> 01:49:51.418
OUT THE ONE ADDRESS AND

01:49:51.484 --> 01:49:55.455
NOTIFIED THE UTILITY OWNERS AT

01:49:55.522 --> 01:49:55.989
THAT ADDRESS. LEAVING OFF

01:49:56.056 --> 01:50:00.727
EVERYTHING ELSE. THAT THEY PUT

01:50:00.794 --> 01:50:01.494
IN THE TEXT SO WE TOOK AWAY THE

01:50:01.561 --> 01:50:02.562
ABILITY TO PUT IN FREE TEXT IN

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:03.296
THE FLAVOR. THAT IS FOR

01:50:03.363 --> 01:50:04.130
HOMEOWNERS ALL THAT'S FOR THE

01:50:04.197 --> 01:50:04.764
SINGLE ADDRESS WITH NO

01:50:04.831 --> 01:50:06.566
TRAINING. THAT THE ROBUST ONE

01:50:06.633 --> 01:50:08.034
THAT'S DESIGNED FOR HIGH VOLUME

01:50:08.101 --> 01:50:09.736
EXCAVATORS THAT HAVE TO WATCH A

01:50:09.803 --> 01:50:11.504
VIDEO AND- CONFIRM THAT THEY'VE

01:50:11.571 --> 01:50:14.574
BEEN TRAINED THEY STILL HAVE

01:50:14.641 --> 01:50:15.175
FREE ACCESS TO DO ANYTHING AND

01:50:15.241 --> 01:50:17.978
EVERYTHING. HE SAID. THANK YOU

01:50:18.044 --> 01:50:22.849
FOR THAT EXPLANATION. THE. HEY

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:26.186
CPUC M. AND AS YOU KNOW I ASKED

01:50:26.252 --> 01:50:29.222
THE PREVIOUS PANEL ABOUT THE

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:29.956
PARTNER AGENCIES IN THE

01:50:30.023 --> 01:50:32.625
SUPPORTING THE- THEIR EDUCATION

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:34.861
IN LIEU OF FINE- STANDS AS THE

01:50:34.928 --> 01:50:39.132
CPUC CONTEMPLATED THAT APPROACH

01:50:39.199 --> 01:50:39.766
AND HOW WOULD IT FIT INTO THEIR

01:50:39.833 --> 01:50:43.703
ENFORCEMENT. STRUCTURE I THINK

01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:44.671
AGAIN AS FAR AS CONTEMPLATING

01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:47.173
THAT'S AS I ALLUDED EARLIER IS

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:48.641
ONE OF THE ELEMENTS SO THE NINE

01:50:48.708 --> 01:50:49.209
ELEMENTS HAVING THAT IS A

01:50:49.275 --> 01:50:52.879
PROCESS. OF IT FOR OFFENDERS SO

01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:54.748
WITH WITH THE UTILITIES WE

01:50:54.814 --> 01:50:56.383
DON'T REGULATE THE CONTRACTORS

01:50:56.449 --> 01:50:58.251
AND IN THE EXCAVATORS OTHER

01:50:58.318 --> 01:50:59.185
THAN THE NON OTHER THAN THE

01:50:59.252 --> 01:51:00.887
UTILITY FOLKS INVOLVED BUT-

01:51:00.954 --> 01:51:02.822
AGAIN FROM OUR PROCESS IT'S

01:51:02.889 --> 01:51:04.524
LOOKING AT THE DAMAGES FROM THE

01:51:04.591 --> 01:51:07.193
UTILITY AND- IS IT A RETRAINING

01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:09.863
ISSUE IS THE IS THAT A- WHAT

01:51:09.929 --> 01:51:11.931
WAS DID THE- INCIDENT- DAMAGE

01:51:11.998 --> 01:51:14.501

01:57:45.291 --> 01:57:46.592
SAYING THERE'S CERTAINLY AREAS

01:57:46.659 --> 01:57:47.894
AS IT'S BEEN NOTED BEFORE

01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:50.696
THERE'S MISS MARKS AND LATE

01:57:50.763 --> 01:57:51.197
TICKETS AND THINGS ARE

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:53.933
OCCURRING I AND NUMBER AVOID

WILL SUMMER NINE AND- YOU KNOW

01:57:56.769 --> 01:57:57.603
AGAIN LOOKING A CUBIC UC'S

01:57:57.670 --> 01:58:00.339
LOOKING AT THOSE. BUT AS FAR AS

01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:02.108
OVERALL ISSUES OF THAT TYPE

01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:03.376
THAT'S NOT BEEN A GAS

01:58:03.443 --> 01:58:06.879
INSPECTIONS A WE'VE DONE SO

01:58:06.946 --> 01:58:07.480
FAR. THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT IS

01:58:07.547 --> 01:58:10.716
AT ISSUE. YOU KNOW IT THE AGAIN

01:58:10.783 --> 01:58:11.317
THE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF

01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:12.185
THE QUEUE IF YOU SEE PROGRAMS.

01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:13.653
BUT AS FAR AS ISSUES YES

01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:15.054
THERE'S RIGHT AREAS THERE'S IT

01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:15.955
CERTAINLY IN AREAS FOR

01:58:16.022 --> 01:58:17.390
IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF.

01:58:17.457 --> 01:58:18.491
GETTING ACCURACY GETTING

01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:20.359
TICKETS MARKED ON TIME AVOIDING

01:58:20.426 --> 01:58:22.595
DAMAGES BY THE UTILITIES OWN-

01:58:22.662 --> 01:58:24.931
EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES. BUT A

01:58:24.997 --> 01:58:27.366
OVERALL IT'S NOT A LARGE

01:58:27.433 --> 01:58:28.768
TRAINED- THAT THAT WE'RE

01:58:28.835 --> 01:58:31.704
OBSERVING OKAY. GOOD AND HOW

01:58:31.771 --> 01:58:32.905
HOW IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

IT TAKES A BOARD ON ME ARE YOU

01:58:34.774 --> 01:58:37.443
WORKING. THROUGH THAT MO USED

01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:39.011
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A-

01:58:39.078 --> 01:58:40.847
THE COMMUNICATION OF THE ISSUES

01:58:40.913 --> 01:58:41.814
BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY AT THE

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:44.350
HEART OF. THE ENFORCEMENT AND

01:58:44.417 --> 01:58:46.052
MOST OF THOSE PROBLEMS WILL

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:47.787
WIND UP IN YOUR LAP AT SOME

01:58:47.854 --> 01:58:48.921
POINT IN TIME I WOULD THINK WE

01:58:48.988 --> 01:58:50.957
AGAIN WE'VE- YEAH WE'VE DONE

01:58:51.023 --> 01:58:51.724
INCIDENT DESTINATIONS OF

01:58:51.791 --> 01:58:54.227
DICKENS. FOR A LONG TIME THIS

01:58:54.293 --> 01:58:54.827
SO AS FAR AS THE ISSUES THAT

01:58:54.894 --> 01:58:57.063
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT NHà. WE

01:58:57.129 --> 01:58:58.030
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A BIG

01:58:58.097 --> 01:59:00.233
BOARD- TO IDENTIFY HOW THE DATA

01:59:00.299 --> 01:59:01.634
IS GOING TO BE RECEIVED WHAT.

01:59:01.701 --> 01:59:03.035
ARE YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE

01:59:03.102 --> 01:59:04.270
ACCOMMODATE EACH OTHER'S NEEDS

01:59:04.337 --> 01:59:05.438
I MEAN OTHER THAN ESTABLISHING

01:59:05.505 --> 01:59:07.406
THE ANIMAL YOU WE HAVEN'T HAD

01:59:07.473 --> 01:59:08.574
ANY. RECENT MEETINGS OR

01:59:08.641 --> 01:59:10.309
DISCUSSIONS ON THAT END. BUT

01:59:10.376 --> 01:59:13.412
CERTAINLY IN IN TERMS OF HOW WE

01:59:13.479 --> 01:59:15.848
CAN. RECEIVE THAT AND YOU KNOW.

01:59:15.915 --> 01:59:16.516
AT SOME POINT WE'VE GOT TO

01:59:16.582 --> 01:59:17.250
DECIDE HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:59:17.316 --> 01:59:19.018
PROCESS THOSE AS WELL. BUT WE

01:59:19.085 --> 01:59:20.820
CERTAINLY ANTICIPATE THERE

01:59:20.887 --> 01:59:22.255
WOULD BE MORE BECAUSE IT. THERE

01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:23.623
ARE MORE HITS THAN TEN YEAH

01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:24.557
WE'RE WE'RE ABLE TO

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:26.726
INVESTIGATE- AND IF SOME OF

01:59:26.792 --> 01:59:28.160
THOSE COME OUR WAY THAN THAT

01:59:28.227 --> 01:59:29.195
THAT WOULD BE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:59:29.262 --> 01:59:31.898
WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO. BUT AS

01:59:31.964 --> 01:59:33.533
YOU KNOW AS FAR AS ANY RECENT

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:34.634
DISCUSSIONS ON THE ANIMAL YOU I

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:36.469
DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN

01:59:36.536 --> 01:59:37.436
ANYTHING MORE. THAN THEM ONCE

01:59:37.503 --> 01:59:40.573
WE ESTABLISHED. DR MARINA. AND

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:43.543
MAYBE MAYBE I CAN JUST ADD-

01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:44.243
CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN

01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:47.113
DISCUSSIONS- BETWEEN OUR

01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:49.615
INVESTIGATORS. AND PC AND SEE

01:59:49.682 --> 01:59:50.983
NEIL BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME

01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:53.185
DISCUSSIONS- BETWEEN OUR

01:59:53.252 --> 01:59:55.521
ATTORNEYS. AND AS I THINK WE

01:59:55.588 --> 01:59:57.356
ALL KNOW THE PC IS A THE AGENCY

01:59:57.423 --> 01:59:58.424
WHERE YOU WANT TO. MAKE SURE

01:59:58.491 --> 02:00:00.059
YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR LAWS

02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:02.528
BEFORE YOU JUMPING INTO THEIR

02:00:02.595 --> 02:00:03.596
SO THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS

02:00:03.663 --> 02:00:12.905
AT THAT ATTORNEY LEVELS WELL.

02:00:12.972 --> 02:00:13.906
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FOR THE

02:00:13.973 --> 02:00:20.112
TWENTY EIGHT. THE BIG BOARD

DISCUSSED IN THEIR TESTIMONY

02:00:20.746 --> 02:00:21.447
THE NEED FOR MORE DATA. TO

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:22.181
TRACK TRENDS INDIANS IN ORDER

02:00:22.248 --> 02:00:22.648
TO BETTER TAILOR THEIR

02:00:22.715 --> 02:00:23.249
EDUCATION PROGRAM TO SPECIFIC

02:00:23.316 --> 02:00:24.150
TASKS AS WE'VE SEEN. WE ALSO

02:00:24.216 --> 02:00:24.917
DISCUSSED THE NEED TO MANDATE A

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.619
CALL. TO A ONE ONE IN THE EVENT

02:00:26.686 --> 02:00:27.253
OF A DEACON ESPECIALLY CLOSING

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.354
THE LOOP ON A CALL BEFORE YOU

02:00:28.421 --> 02:00:29.522
DIG TO INCLUDE A CALL AFTER YOU

02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:30.790
TAKE. A OR DIG INTO SOMETHING-

02:00:30.856 --> 02:00:32.692
BOTH OF THESE TOPICS CENTER AND

02:00:32.758 --> 02:00:34.060
THE OPERATIONS AT THE ONE CALL

02:00:34.126 --> 02:00:36.896
CENTERS AND- A RELIANCE ON YOUR

02:00:36.963 --> 02:00:38.431
PARTICIPATION IN THAT TO MAKE

02:00:38.497 --> 02:00:40.066
IT WORK OR JUST. EAT WITH THE

02:00:40.132 --> 02:00:42.768
PASSAGE OF AB ELEVEN SIXTY SIX

02:00:42.835 --> 02:00:43.803
OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE

02:00:43.869 --> 02:00:45.838
EARLIER THIS YEAR. REQUIRED

02:00:45.905 --> 02:00:47.406
REQUIRING ELECTRIC ELECTRONIC

02:00:47.473 --> 02:00:48.741
POSITIVE RESPONSE TO ONE CALL

02:00:48.808 --> 02:00:51.143
CENTERS AFTER LOCATING MARK.

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:54.981
HOW DO YOU FORESEE THE ONE CALL

02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:55.615
CENTERS. ADJUSTING TO THESE NEW

02:00:55.681 --> 02:00:57.249
REQUIREMENTS. THE GREAT

02:00:57.316 --> 02:00:59.585
QUESTION FIRST THE I WANT TO

02:00:59.652 --> 02:01:01.754
SAY THAT WE ARE VERY PLEASED

02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:03.222
WELL I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MYSELF

02:01:03.289 --> 02:01:05.591
I'M CONFIDENT THAT- DEALER

02:01:05.658 --> 02:01:07.193
WOULD AGREE WITH ME BUT I WON'T

02:01:07.259 --> 02:01:09.161
PUT WORDS IN IN THEIR MOUTH-

02:01:09.228 --> 02:01:11.764
BUT USA NORTH IS VERY PLEASED

02:01:11.831 --> 02:01:13.165
WITH BOTH OF THESE- NEW

02:01:13.232 --> 02:01:16.135
DEVELOPMENTS- WE'D BE HAPPY TO

02:01:16.202 --> 02:01:19.238
RECEIVE. A RECALL- REPORTS OF

02:01:19.305 --> 02:01:20.873
DAMAGE OF EVERY TYPE BECUSE

02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:22.908
THEN WE HAVE THE DATA SO THEN

02:01:22.975 --> 02:01:23.776
WE CAN KNOW HOW TO TARGET OUR

02:01:23.843 --> 02:01:25.911
EDUCATION BECAUSE RIGHT NOW- NO

02:01:25.978 --> 02:01:27.079
OFFENSE TO THE DIG SAKE BOARD

02:01:27.146 --> 02:01:27.747
BUT THEY'RE STILL IN THEIR

02:01:27.813 --> 02:01:30.683
INFANCY IN SO RIGHT NOW THE-

02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:32.852
EDUCATION IS BEING DONE BY US-

02:01:32.918 --> 02:01:36.555
MEANING THE TO NOTIFICATION-CENTERS AN THEN YOU KNOW SOME-

02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:40.426
FACILITY OPERATORS DO THAT-

02:01:40.493 --> 02:01:42.028
VERY WELL ALSO AND HAVE ROBUST

02:01:42.094 --> 02:01:43.429
PROGRAM SUCH A SO CAL GAS AND

02:01:43.496 --> 02:01:45.031
P. JEANNIE AND OTHERS BUT THEN

02:01:45.097 --> 02:01:47.133
THERE ARE MANY WHO DO NOTHING.

02:01:47.199 --> 02:01:49.635
I EVEN LARGE COMPANIES IT'S NOT

02:01:49.702 --> 02:01:53.539
ON THEIR RADAR SO ANYWAY THE I

02:01:53.606 --> 02:01:55.107
THINK YOU I THINK IT WOULD BE

02:01:55.174 --> 02:01:57.443
FAIR TO SAY THAT- THE ONE CALL

02:01:57.510 --> 02:02:00.312
CENTERS ARE DOING A VERY LARGE

02:02:00.379 --> 02:02:01.781
PERCENTAGE OF THE EDUCATION

02:02:01.847 --> 02:02:03.282
THAT'S HAPPENING STATEWIDE

02:02:03.349 --> 02:02:05.317
RIGHT NOW SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO

02:02:05.384 --> 02:02:06.285
SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT

02:02:06.352 --> 02:02:08.054
FROM A RESOURCES POINT OF VIEW

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:09.455
ABOUT RECEIVING THE NOTICES

02:02:09.522 --> 02:02:10.556
WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE IT WE

02:02:10.623 --> 02:02:11.924
DON'T SEE ANY BARRIERS AND NO

02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:13.325
BARRIERS THE SYSTEMS ALREADY IN

02:02:13.392 --> 02:02:15.161
PLACE WE CAN DO IT ONLINE TOO

02:02:15.227 --> 02:02:16.529
SO WANT TO BE A RESOURCES ISSUE

02:02:16.595 --> 02:02:19.298
NO PROBLEM- THE ELECTRON PAS

02:02:19.365 --> 02:02:23.803
RESPONSE THAT'S A BIG. DEAL

02:02:23.869 --> 02:02:27.807
THAT. THAT IS GOOD. IT'S GOING

02:02:27.873 --> 02:02:28.474
TO MAKE THE WORLD SAFER THIS IS

02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:29.575
PROVEN TO BE THE CASE IN MANY

02:02:29.642 --> 02:02:30.843
STATES THAT HAVE THIS THEIR

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:31.410
STATE THAT I'VE HAD THIS FOR

02:02:31.477 --> 02:02:32.244
DECADES AND THIRD AND THERE'RE

02:02:32.311 --> 02:02:33.946
DAMAGE. RATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

02:02:34.013 --> 02:02:36.015
LOWER. HOWEVER RIGHTNOW IT'S

02:02:36.082 --> 02:02:38.651
VOLUNTARY AS IT STARTED IN

02:02:38.718 --> 02:02:39.251
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO NOW IT

02:02:39.318 --> 02:02:40.986
BECOMES MANDATORY TWENTY TWENTY

02:02:41.053 --> 02:02:43.122
ONE. WHICH IS A GOOD THING.

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:44.690
OTHERS TALK ABOUT ALLOWING-

02:02:44.757 --> 02:02:46.926
EXEMPTIONS FOR MORE TIME FOR

02:02:46.992 --> 02:02:49.795
OPERATORS TO- COMPLY WITH THAT

02:02:49.862 --> 02:02:52.965
REQUIREMENT I WOULD- STRONGLY

02:02:53.032 --> 02:02:53.999
RECOMMEND THERE BE NO

02:02:54.066 --> 02:02:56.502
EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE THIS. IS

02:02:56.569 --> 02:02:57.369
BECAUSE OF THERE'S EVEN ONE

02:02:57.436 --> 02:02:59.305
EXEMPTION IT'S STILL VOLUNTARY.

02:02:59.371 --> 02:03:00.639
BASICALLY AND THE CONTRACTORS

02:03:00.706 --> 02:03:02.942
ARE NOT GOING TO USE IT. UNTIL

02:03:03.008 --> 02:03:04.810
THEY KNOW THAT IT'S MANDATORY.

02:03:04.877 --> 02:03:06.378
THE OTHER ASPECT IS THE WORDING

02:03:06.445 --> 02:03:08.581
REQUIRES THE EXCAVATOR THE-

02:03:08.647 --> 02:03:10.349
FACILITY OPERATORS TO RESPOND

02:03:10.416 --> 02:03:11.317
TO THE SYSTEM BUT THE WORDING

02:03:11.383 --> 02:03:13.319
OF THAT BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE

02:03:13.385 --> 02:03:14.520
THE EXCAVATOR TO CHECK THE

02:03:14.587 --> 02:03:16.388
SYSTEM BEFORE HE TAKES. AND I

02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:18.057
THINK THAT IS A PART THAT IS

02:03:18.124 --> 02:03:18.958
MISSING. BECAUSE WHAT GOOD DOES

02:03:19.024 --> 02:03:21.660
IT DO IF ALL THE FACILITY

02:03:21.727 --> 02:03:23.062
OPERATORS REPLY TO THE SYSTEM

02:03:23.129 --> 02:03:24.263
BUT THEN THE EXPANDER NEVER

02:03:24.330 --> 02:03:25.431
LOOKS AT THAT NOW I THINK THE

02:03:25.498 --> 02:03:26.966
GOOD ONES WILL. BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:03:27.032 --> 02:03:29.368
GOOD BUT THE OTHER ONES WON'T

02:03:29.435 --> 02:03:32.004
AND SO I- THE OTHER THING IS.

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:34.073
THAT THE FUTURE OF THIS IS WHAT

02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:35.875
WE CALL IN THE INDUSTRY ENHANCE

02:03:35.941 --> 02:03:37.543
THE POSITIVE RESPONSE WERE NOT

02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:40.112
ONLY IS IT. A SO CAL GAS. OF

02:03:40.179 --> 02:03:41.847
INDICATED IN THE SYSTEM THAT

02:03:41.914 --> 02:03:43.682
THEY MARK THE LINE. BUT NOW

02:03:43.749 --> 02:03:44.450
THEY'VE ALSO UPLOADED

02:03:44.517 --> 02:03:46.085
ATTACHMENTS SUCH AS PICTURES

02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:48.387
MARKINGS AND LANDS. AND THE

02:03:48.454 --> 02:03:49.455
OTHER WAY THE EXCAVATOR COULD

02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:50.856
DO THAT IN THE BEGINNING THEY

02:03:50.923 --> 02:03:52.725
CAN SEND PICTURES OF THE

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:54.326
DELINEATION AND WHITE TO SAY

02:03:54.393 --> 02:03:56.061
HERE'S MY DIG SITE SO THE SO

02:03:56.128 --> 02:03:57.563
CAL GAS KNOWS THAT. YEP THEY'VE

02:03:57.630 --> 02:03:59.265
BEEN THERE. SO MY LOCATOR IS

02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:00.199
GONNA BE ABLE TO FIND THE DIG

02:04:00.266 --> 02:04:01.367
SITE CORRECTLY AS WEL AS THEIR

02:04:01.433 --> 02:04:02.935
PLANS AND NOW THE PARTIES ARE

02:04:03.002 --> 02:04:04.603
TALKING. AND IF THEY WANT TO

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:06.172
NEGOTIATE A LATER START TIME

02:04:06.238 --> 02:04:07.339
BECAUSE THE PROJECT IS BIGGER

02:04:07.406 --> 02:04:09.275
THERE- OTHER FACILITIES IN THE

02:04:09.341 --> 02:04:10.476
WAY THAT CAN'T BE LOCATE AND

02:04:10.543 --> 02:04:11.777
THINGS LIKE THAT THAT CAN ALL

02:04:11.844 --> 02:04:13.112
BE DOCUMENTED IN THE SYSTEM.

02:04:13.179 --> 02:04:15.214
AND THEN REGULATORS LIKE SNAIL

CAN COME IN AND- AND SEE THE

02:04:16.682 --> 02:04:18.117

JUMP RIGHT IN AND BECOME A

02:04:49.215 --> 02:04:50.649
LEADER LIKE CALIFORNIA STRIVE

02:04:50.716 --> 02:04:52.518

THEM OF A FINANCIAL DEFICIT.

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:08.033
AND CURRENTLY THERE FUNDING

02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:08.901
ARISES FROM A FEE ON THE

02:05:08.968 --> 02:05:10.536
OPERATORS AS MR WHEN HE WAS

02:05:10.603 --> 02:05:12.104
TALKING ABOUT THAT EVERYTHING

02:05:12.171 --> 02:05:13.339
SEEMS TO GO TO FEED TO THE

02:05:13.405 --> 02:05:15.941
OPERATORS- I'VE HEARD ARGUMENTS

02:05:16.008 --> 02:05:17.910
THAT A SMALL FEE ON EXCAVATORS

02:05:17.977 --> 02:05:19.645
COULD FACILITATE MORE GREATER

02:05:19.712 --> 02:05:21.680
BY IN ON THE THAT FROM THE

02:05:21.747 --> 02:05:24.316
ACTUATOR COMMUNITY. TO THE WORK

02:05:24.383 --> 02:05:27.386

AND WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

02:05:32.324 --> 02:05:34.460
COULD WORK IN THE FUTURE A- I

02:05:34.526 --> 02:05:35.828
THINK THE OPTION IS THERE BUT I

02:05:35.895 --> 02:05:37.029
THINK THERE'S A NEED FOR A MUCH

02:05:37.096 --> 02:05:38.697
MORE DISCUSSION IN THAT REGARD

02:05:38.764 --> 02:05:40.399
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO

02:05:40.466 --> 02:05:41.934
DIS INCENTIVIZE. AND YOU KNOW I

02:05:42.001 --> 02:05:43.469
DEAL WITH A LARGER CONTRACTORS

02:05:43.535 --> 02:05:44.703
THAT THEY MAY NOT BE SUCH A BIG

02:05:44.770 --> 02:05:45.804
DEAL BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING

02:05:45.871 --> 02:05:47.673
ABOUT THE SMALLER GUYS THE GUYS

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:48.340
WHO ARE DOING THIS ON A REGULAR

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:49.408
BASIS WE DON'T CREATE A

02:05:49.475 --> 02:05:51.610
DISINCENTIVE. FOR THEM TO CALL

02:05:51.677 --> 02:05:52.144
EIGHT ONE ONE BECAUSE NOW

02:05:52.211 --> 02:05:53.212
THERE'S A PRICE TAG ASSOCIATED

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:54.380
WITH THAT SO IF YOU TAKE THAT

02:05:54.446 --> 02:05:56.115
INTO CONSIDERATION. YOU KNOW I

02:05:56.181 --> 02:05:57.883
THINK THE DOORS OPEN TO HAVE

THAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT

EXCAVATORS CALL EIGHT ONE ONE-

02:07:11.590 --> 02:07:13.192
THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES

02:07:13.258 --> 02:07:15.728
GO TREMENDOUSLY DOWN A WHICH IS

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:17.329
WHAT I THOUGHT TOO WELL WHAT I

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:18.564
THINK STILL DOES THIS PROCESS

02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:20.399
REALLY REALLY ISN'T AND AS WE

02:07:20.466 --> 02:07:21.600
GET INTO SOME OF THE MORE

02:07:21.667 --> 02:07:26.772
DETAILS- PRESENTATIONS. IN AN

02:07:26.839 --> 02:07:27.339
AND DETAILED DISCUSSIONS YOU

02:07:30.242 --> 02:07:30.909
DETAILS THAT NEED TO NEED TO BE

02:07:30.976 --> 02:07:33.379
WORKED OUT OF COURSE. WHAT ONE

02:07:33.445 --> 02:07:34.013
OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE

02:07:34.079 --> 02:07:35.781
SHOULD COMPLEMENT TO IS OUT OF

02:07:35.848 --> 02:07:38.350
THE P. UC'S INVESTIGATION- THAT

02:07:38.417 --> 02:07:39.651
HAS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED

02:07:39.718 --> 02:07:42.054
WHATSOEVR IN ANY OF THE DIXIE

02:07:42.121 --> 02:07:43.088
FOR BOARD MEETINGS WHICH IS

02:07:43.155 --> 02:07:44.256
INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK

02:07:44.323 --> 02:07:45.791
THAT A LOT OF INFORMATION CAN

02:07:45.858 --> 02:07:47.526
BE GLEANED FROM THAT. AND TAKE

02:07:47.593 --> 02:07:49.495
IN AND LOOKED AT OKAY WHAT ARE

02:07:49.561 --> 02:07:50.963
SOME SCENARIOS HAT WE COULD

02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:52.197
FIX SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT

02:07:52.264 --> 02:07:53.966
WE SAW- IN IN IN THAT

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:55.768
INVESTIGATION ONE OF THEM WAS

02:07:55.834 --> 02:07:57.770
AB ELEVEN SIXTY SIX BY MR

02:07:57.836 --> 02:08:00.939
LEVINE- THAT SPECIFICALLY WILL

02:08:01.006 --> 02:08:01.573
ENSURE THAT. THE TICKETS AREN'T

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:05.377
GOING TO BE. SAY THIS PLAYED A

02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:07.246
FABRICATED OR OR OR CHANGED

02:08:07.312 --> 02:08:08.414
THAT WON'T HAPPEN ANYMORE

02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:09.181
INJURY BE ELEVEN SIXTY SIX

02:08:09.248 --> 02:08:12.084
THAT'S VERY VERY POSITIVE- ONE

02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:13.619
THING I WOULD LIKE TO. TO

02:08:13.685 --> 02:08:14.486
CLARIFY IN AND I DONALD

02:08:14.553 --> 02:08:17.523
SLIGHTLY MISLEADING- WAS THAT

02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:19.091
THE DAMAGES ARE NOT BEING

02:08:19.158 --> 02:08:20.626
REPORTED WHATSOEVER. AND THAT'S

02:08:20.692 --> 02:08:23.662
SIMPLY NOT THE CASE A SECTION

02:08:23.729 --> 02:08:25.197
FORTY TWO SIXTEEN SEE ONE- IT

02:08:25.264 --> 02:08:26.498
IN IN IN AN INSTANT WHEN

02:08:26.565 --> 02:08:28.033
EXCAVATOR DAMAGES SOMETHING

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:30.102
UNDERGROUND FIRST. FIRST CALL

02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:31.303
OF COURSE IS GOING TO BE NINE

02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:33.105
ONE ONE IF SOMEONE WAS INJURED-

02:08:33.172 --> 02:08:34.239
AND THEN THE STATUTE ALSO

02:08:34.306 --> 02:08:36.675
REQUIRES. THE CON THE EXCAVATOR

02:08:36.742 --> 02:08:39.078
TO CONTACT THE OPERATOR'S WELL-

02:08:39.144 --> 02:08:40.412
SO THAT THERE IS COMMUNICATION

02:08:40.479 --> 02:08:42.848
GOING ON- IT'S NOT AS IF WHILE

02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:45.651
WE'RE NOT GONNA CALL ANYONE AND

02:08:45.717 --> 02:08:48.087
NOT FOLLOW THROUGH- A COUPLE

02:08:48.153 --> 02:08:50.289
OTHER POINTS. AND I DIDN'T SAY

02:08:50.355 --> 02:08:51.590
SO SHOULD COMPLEMENT THE BOARD

02:08:51.657 --> 02:08:52.724
AS WELL THEY THEY'VE DONE AN

02:08:52.791 --> 02:08:54.326
OUTSTANDING JOB THEY'VE BEEN

02:08:54.393 --> 02:08:55.627
VERY VERY THOROUGH VERY

02:08:55.694 --> 02:08:57.830
THOROUGH. VERY PROFESSIONAL OF

02:08:57.896 --> 02:08:59.264
THE PROVIDED OF SOMETHING THAT

02:08:59.331 --> 02:09:00.466
WE TALKED ABOUT IN IN THE

02:09:00.532 --> 02:09:02.468
MEETINGS YEARS AGO A VENUE FOR

02:09:02.534 --> 02:09:04.002
OPERATORS AND EXCAVATORS TO

02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:04.736
COME TOGETHER ALL THE

02:09:04.803 --> 02:09:06.472
STAKEHOLDERS TO COME TOGETHER.

02:09:06.538 --> 02:09:07.439
AND THAT'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY

02:09:07.506 --> 02:09:09.041
POSITIVE IN THE WORK PRODUCT

02:09:09.108 --> 02:09:11.510
THEY BRING OUT THE- PRODUCED-

02:09:11.577 --> 02:09:12.578
IS EXTRAORDINARY TO VERY

02:09:12.644 --> 02:09:14.113
DETAILED VERY THOROUGH SO WITH

02:09:14.179 --> 02:09:15.314
OUTSTANDING JOB THAT THEY'VE

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:19.685
DONE. I THINK SCCA MY CLIENT

02:09:19.751 --> 02:09:24.123
WOULD LIKE TO SEE. A LITTLE BIT

02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:25.424
MORE MOVEMENT TOWARDS A

02:09:25.491 --> 02:09:26.458
DEVELOPING STANDARDS- WE WE'VE

OUT TO THREE OR FOUR HOURS VERY

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:30.129

DON'T CALL THROUGH THAT YOU

02:09:43.041 --> 02:09:44.877
THROUGH THAT INVESTIGATION THEN

02:09:44.943 --> 02:09:46.712
YOU CAN FOCUS THE EDUCATION

02:09:46.778 --> 02:09:48.247
SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS WHERE

02:09:48.313 --> 02:09:50.115
THERE'S- PEOPLE ARE CALLING A

02:09:50.182 --> 02:09:51.750

FIRST SENT. FIRST SET OF

02:09:53.685 --> 02:09:54.820
REGULATIONS THAT CAME THROUGH

02:09:54.887 --> 02:09:57.623
EARLIER THIS YEAR- THE

02:09:57.689 --> 02:09:58.991
REGULATIONS WERE FOCUSED ON

02:09:59.057 --> 02:10:01.860
SOME OF THE MY NEW SHOW OF. OF

02:10:01.927 --> 02:10:03.328
THE BOARD AND THEIR PROCESS-

THE THINGS THEY SAY

02:10:07.065 --> 02:10:08.800
SPECIFICALLY THE BUT- AUTUMN.

02:10:08.867 --> 02:10:10.769
IS WHAT THE FORTY OF THE BOARD

02:10:10.836 --> 02:10:12.504
USED TO DOT THE REGULATION. AND

02:10:12.571 --> 02:10:14.873
IN ALL TWENTY TWO INSTANCES IT

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:16.942
WAS THE PRODUCT FORTY GIVEN TO

02:10:17.009 --> 02:10:18.277
THE BOARD RATHER THAN THAT VERY

02:10:18.343 --> 02:10:20.612
SPECIFIC FORTY- DEALING WITH

02:10:20.679 --> 02:10:22.181
INVESTIGATIONS ARE STANDARD SO

02:10:22.247 --> 02:10:23.315
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO

02:10:23.382 --> 02:10:24.716
SEE THE BOARD MOVE. IN ANOTHER

02:10:24.783 --> 02:10:26.985
DIRECTION ARMED VERY QUICKLY ON

02:10:27.052 --> 02:10:29.555
