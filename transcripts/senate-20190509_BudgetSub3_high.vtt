TRANSPORTATION ELIGIBILITY AND

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.178
WE HAVE TO JUST BE HONEST IS

00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:19.845
THAT THE FIRST TIME WE HEARD IT

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:21.680

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.015
TIME THAT THAT'S BEEN RAISED TO

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:23.249
US SO.

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:24.483
WE'RE HAPPY TO HEAR FROM THE

PANEL TODAY WHAT THOSE CONCERNS

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:27.920
ARE BUT LIKE I SAID WHEN WE HAD

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.356
A CCS ADVISORY GROUP MEETING --

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:32.158
LAST MONTH THOSE WERE NOT --

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:33.092
RAISED HIS ITEMS BUT CERTAINLY

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:34.860
WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

00:11:34.927 --> 00:11:37.063
CONCERNS ARE -- AROUND

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:39.331
ELIGIBILITY LAPSES -- SO

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:41.233
CHILDREN IN CCS HAVE BOTH

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.868
MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY THAT IS DONE

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:44.370
BY THE COUNTY AND THE COUNTY

00:11:44.437 --> 00:11:46.338
RETAINS THAT MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:47.973
DETERMINATION AND AND SOME OF

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.076
THE REASONS FOR THAT -- FOR US

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:51.410
IS THE PLANS ARE PAID A

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.579
DIFFERENT RATE -- FOR CCS

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:54.947
ELIGIBLE CHILD BASED ON THEIR

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:56.549
CCS SELLABLE CONDITION AND WE

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:57.783
WANTED THE COUNTY SO KIND OF

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.319
RETAIN THAT -- SAFETY MECHANISM

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.520
IF YOU WILL I'M JUST TO MAKE

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:02.888
SURE THAT SOMEONE WAS CONFIRMING

00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:04.123
THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD A CCS

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.125
CONDITION WHICH MADE THEM INTO A

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:08.427
DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURE -- I

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:10.563
KNOW THAT -- THERE'S ALSO MEDI

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:12.364
CAL ELIGIBILITY SO FOR THE VAST

00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:13.532
MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN THAT

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:14.333
ARE IN.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.302
CCS ALSO HAVE MEDI CAL

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:17.703
ELIGIBILITY YOU HAVE TWO

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.804
DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY IS BEING

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:24.276
DONE AND SO BOTH OF THOSE -- ARE

00:12:24.343 --> 00:12:26.212
AT THE AT THE ADMINISTRATION OF

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:28.114
THE COUNTIES AND SO UNLESS OF

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.949
COURSE THEY'RE DEPENDENT COUNTY --

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.884
BUT THAT'S A SMALL POPULATION OF

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:33.219
COUNTIES THAT WE DO THE MEDICAL

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:35.821
DETERMINATIONS FOR SO -- IF IT'S

00:12:35.888 --> 00:12:37.356
A MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY ISSUE

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:38.724
OBVIOUSLY MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:40.693
CONTINUES TO BE HANDLED BY THE

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.294
COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT.

00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:43.796
IF IT'S A MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:45.331
NOT MEDI CAL BUT MEDICAL

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:47.299
ELIGIBILITY ALSO STILL RETAINED

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:49.635
BY THE BY THE COUNTY MEDICAL

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:51.971
DIRECTOR IN THE CCS PROGRAM --

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:54.373
TRANSPORTATION -- HAS BEEN A

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.842
REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR US --

00:12:56.909 --> 00:13:00.846
WE DIRECTED THE PLANS -- LAST

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:03.415
YEAR TWO YEARS TIME FLIES -- TWO

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:05.417
YEARS AGO -- THAT THEY HAD TO

00:13:05.484 --> 00:13:07.853
PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION TO THEIR

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.288
ENROLLED BENEFICIARIES

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.689
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:12.458
SERVICE THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING.

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:13.459
WAS WITHIN THE PLANTS FISCAL

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:16.028
RESPONSIBILITY SO IN SOME CASES

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:17.963
IF A HEALTH PLAN A CEMETERY --

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.533
MEMBER IS NEEDING TRANSPORTATION

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:22.134
TO A DENTAL APPOINTMENT EVEN

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:23.969
THOUGH SAN MATTEO IS NOT

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:25.838
RESPONSIBLE -- ARE AUTHORIZING

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:27.573
THE DENTAL APPOINTMENT THEY DO

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.774
RETAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:30.442
TRANSPORTATION COSTS ASSOCIATED

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:31.777
WITH THAT APPOINTMENT.

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:34.380
AND THAT HAS BEEN -- AS WE HAVE

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:36.515
HEARD -- BOTH THE RAPIDLY

00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:38.150
INCREASING AND A WELL USED

00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:39.818
BENEFIT AND I THINK IT SPEAKS TO

00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:41.654
THE IMPORTANCE AND UNDERSERVED

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.955
ME THAT BENEFICIARIES WERE

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:46.258
HAVING DIFFICULTY AND GETTING --

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:47.493
TRANSPORTATION AND RELIABLE

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.661
TRANSPORTATION TO APPOINTMENTS

00:13:48.727 --> 00:13:49.762
AND SO THAT IS CERTAINLY

00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:52.498
CONTINGENT -- YOU KNOW ON MAKING

00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:53.959
OUT BUT DUE TO IMPLEMENTATION.

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.294
WERE ONLY JUST STARTING TO GET A

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.461
SENSE OF HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:58.463
PHASE ONE COUNTIES AND EVEN LESS

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.532
SO IN PHASE TWO COUNTIES -- AND

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.134
SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT SOME NEW

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.669
ISSUES COULD ARISE ONCE THE

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:04.670
CONTINUITY OF CARE PROVISIONS

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:06.004
LAPSE WHICH WILL ONLY START TO

00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:08.574
HAPPEN THIS SUMMER AND PHASE ONE

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.742
COUNTIES AND SEVEN MONTHS AFTER

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:12.144
THAT FOR FACE -- TO WITH BUT

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.679
WITH ALL OF THAT IN MY AND I'M

00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:14.580
JUST LIKE TO LEAVE THE COMMITTEE

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:15.881
WITH THE THE FOLLOWING POINTS

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:17.282
AND AGAIN THIS IS BASED ON

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.851
ANECDOTAL STORIES -- AND ME TO

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:20.953
TALK ABOUT THE EVALUATION OF THE

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:22.254
END BUT THAT TO US IS WHY THE

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:23.388
EVALUATION IS SO IMPORTANT

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:24.556
THAT'S ALL WE'RE EVER GOING TO

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:26.391
GET AND WE WNT TO MAKE SURE

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:27.225
THAT WE REALLY KNOW WHAT'S

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:29.227
HAPPENING -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:31.229
BEFORE WE EXPAND THIS OUT TO

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:32.397
OTHER COUNTIES.

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:34.399
SO A FIRST WE DO HAVE SOME

00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:36.168
CONCERNS BUT WE'VE HEARD THAT AT

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:37.269
LEAST ONE OF THE CO IS MAYBE

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:38.770
DELEGATING ITS RESPONSIBILITY

00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:39.638
FOR CASE MANAGEMENT AND

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:41.039
TREATMENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO

00:20:41.106 --> 00:20:42.374
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS.

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:43.442
WHICH WE DO NOT BELIEVE IS

00:20:43.508 --> 00:20:46.011
CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF SB

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:46.878
FIVE EIGHTY SIX WE HAVEN'T YET

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.213
HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.581
CLOTHES WE WILL BE DOING THAT --

00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:51.950
AS A RESULT OF THIS PROCESS BUT

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.285
WANTED TO FLAG THAT.

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:54.653
SECOND WE HAVE HEARD THAT SOME

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.355
COUNTY CCS OFFICES MAY BE HAVING

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:57.055
TROUBLE GETTING THE

00:20:57.122 --> 00:20:58.924
DOCUMENTATION THEY NEED FROM THE

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:00.058
COAST TO DETERMINE MEDICAL

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:01.760
ELIGIBILITY FOR CCS WHICH THEY

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:03.996
HAVE TO DO PERIODICALLY -- AT

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:05.530
STILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITY EVEN

00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:07.132
IN WHOLE CHILD MODEL COUNTIES

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:08.000
AND THIRD THERE MAY BE SOME

00:21:08.066 --> 00:21:09.601
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR CCS

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.370
FAMILIES DUE TO LOT THE LOSS OF

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:12.804
THE UNOFFICIAL SOCIAL WORK

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:14.873
FUNCTION THAT THE CCS A CASE

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.340
WORKER SOUTH.

00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:17.209
PERFORMED ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS

00:21:17.275 --> 00:21:18.944
INVOLVES WHEN A CHILD MEDI CAL

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:20.612
LAPSES SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:21.847
PAPERWORK ISSUE.

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:23.181
AND THEY HAVE TO BE RE ENROLLED

00:21:23.248 --> 00:21:24.583
AND COUNTY CCS APAS TYPICALLY

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.551
HELP FAMILIES DO THIS I THINK

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:28.120
YOU'VE HEARD FROM ADULT MEN THAT

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:29.121
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF

00:21:29.187 --> 00:21:29.955
THE CLOTHES ARE DOING BUT WE'RE

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:31.223
NOT NECESSARILY HEARING IT'S

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:32.758
HAPPENING UNIVERSALLY -- AND

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:34.159
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF HAND

00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:35.560
HOLDING THAT WE'RE STILL KIND OF

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:37.696
TROUBLE SHOOTING -- WITH THE

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:39.164
COSTA WANTED TO FLY ABOUT.

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:40.065
LEADING UP TO THIS HEARING WE

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:41.500
DID START SOME INITIAL OUT REACH

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:42.634
TO THE CLOSE ABOUT THESE

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:48.173
CONCERNS WHICH REALLY WERE JUST

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.374
STARTING TO AGGREGATE AGAIN WERE

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:50.142
NOT EVEN A FULL YEAR INTO

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:50.509
IMPLEMENTATION.

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:51.176
AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO

00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:51.777
WORKING WITH THEM TO RESOLVE

00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:52.444
THESE AND WE'RE HEARING A LOT OF

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:53.078
STORIES ABOUT HOW PROVIDERS AND

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.212
MEMBERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS ARE

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.714
GETTING A LOT OF THEIR PROBLEMS

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:57.115
ADDRESSED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO

00:21:57.182 --> 00:21:58.083
WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO HEAR THAT

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.251
WE THINK THAT'S HOW THIS.

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:01.319
REALLY SHOULD BE HANDLED.

00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:02.621
SO FINALLY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO

00:22:02.688 --> 00:22:03.955
HIGHLIGHT A CONCERN WITH THE

00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:05.424
WHOLE TOP MODEL EVALUATION I WAS

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.558
VERY HAPPY TO HEAR FROM THE

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:08.527
DIRECTOR THAT THE DEADLINE HAS

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:09.895
BEEN MOVED OUT WE'RE NOT THAT.

00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:11.296
WAS A CONCERN IT SOUNDS LIKE

00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:12.798
IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED -- IN

00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:14.366
ADDITION WE DID PROVIDE COMMENTS

00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:15.701
TO THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:17.035
DRAFT SCOPE OF WORK THAT THEY

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:18.270
RELEASED AT THE LAST US CCS

00:22:18.336 --> 00:22:19.905
ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING.

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:21.473
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS THE

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.141
DRAFT THAT WE SAW REFLECTS THE

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:25.377
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SB SB FIVE

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:26.545
EIGHTY SIX FOR THE EVALUATION.

00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:27.479
SOME OF THE SPECIFIC

00:22:27.546 --> 00:22:28.747
REQUIREMENTS IN THE STATUTE ARE

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:29.981
DRESSED ONLY SPARINGLY IN THE

00:22:30.048 --> 00:22:32.017
SCOPE OF WORK AND OTHERS NOT AT

00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:33.685
ALL -- AND THE SCOPE OF WORK IS

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:35.520
OVERLY DEPENDENT UPON THE USE OF

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:36.688
SURVEY DATA -- SURVEY

00:22:36.755 --> 00:22:38.323
INSTRUMENTS OF UNKNOWN VALIDITY

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.791
TO MEASURE ASPECTS OF THE WHOLE

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:40.859
TOP MODEL IMPLEMENTATION LIKE

00:22:40.926 --> 00:22:42.794
UTILIZATION ACCESS ACCESS TO

00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:43.929
SERVICES AND WE THINK THOSE

00:22:43.995 --> 00:22:45.163
COULD BE BETTER MEASURED.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.933
BY CLAIMS DATA AND COUNTER DATA

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:49.034
AND EVEN SUCH A CHART SAMPLING.

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:50.602
THIS EVALUATION IS INTENDED TO

THEY NEED BEFORE IT'S EXPANDED

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:55.640
TO NEW COUNTIES AND WE THINK

00:22:55.707 --> 00:22:56.308
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET IT

00:22:56.374 --> 00:22:58.610
RIGHT -- THAT WE WOULD URGE THE

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:00.512
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHETHER

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:02.147
ADOPTING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE --

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:03.915
TO ENSURE THE VALUATION

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:05.417
ADDRESSES THE REQUIREMENTS AND

00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:08.653

TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.582
MODEL CREATED. TO REACH THAT

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:12.517
GOAL IS DESIGNED IN A FAMILY

00:24:12.584 --> 00:24:13.919
CENTERED WAY -- WE'VE HEARD A

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:16.221
LOT FROM FAMILIES AND A FEW

PATTERNS HAVE EMERGED KEEPING IN

00:24:18.723 --> 00:24:20.592
MIND THAT IT IS STILL EARLY ON

00:24:20.659 --> 00:24:21.793
I'LL BEGIN BY SAYING THAT ONE OF

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.627
THE FIRST STEPS TO FAMILY

00:24:22.694 --> 00:24:23.662
CENTEREDNESS IS GETTING

INFORMATION OUT IN AN ACCESSIBLE

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.766
WAY -- CURRENTLY THERE'S ROOM

00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:28.867
FOR IMPROVEMENT AROUND HOW

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:30.502
FAMILIES LEARN ABOUT THE CHANGES

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:32.637
THAT HAVE COME OR ARE SEEM TO

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:34.105
COME WITH THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL.

00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:35.373
FAMILIES WHO ARE CURRENTLY WELL

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.541
AWARE OF THE CHANGES ARE THE

00:24:36.608 --> 00:24:37.409
SAME FAMILIES WHO ARE

00:24:37.475 --> 00:24:38.777
HISTORICALLY ONE FORMED ABOUT

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:41.246
SYSTEMS NAVIGATION DUE TO THE

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:42.280
TIME RESOURCES.

00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:43.949
LANGUAGE CAPACITY AMONG MANY

00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:46.418
OTHER THINGS TO SEEK OUT AND

00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:47.819
UTILIZE THAT INFORMATION.

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:49.120
I'M EVEN AFTER THE WRITTEN

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:50.522
NOTICES AND PHONE CALLS BY THE

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:53.291

PROFESSIONALS WE'VE CONNECTED

00:24:57.896 --> 00:24:59.064
WITH DURING OUR WORK ON THIS

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.732
PROJECT STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.901
THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL AND WHAT

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:03.501
IT MEANS FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S

00:25:03.568 --> 00:25:06.538
CARE -- ANOTHER PATTERN THAT

00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:07.439
WE'RE SEEING IS THAT A LOT OF

00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:09.040
FAMILIES ARE REALLY FEELING THE

00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:10.475
LOSS OF THE CARE COORDINATION

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:16.314
IMPLEMENTATION.

00:25:16.381 --> 00:25:17.249
WHEN CONNECTING WITH HEALTH

COORDINATOR TIED TO THE HEALTH

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:35.279

BE VERY VALUABLE I THINK IT'S

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:01.859
REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET THE THE

00:36:01.926 --> 00:36:05.229

SKINNER NAY REALIZED OR CERTAIN

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:22.880
EXPENSES INVOLVED BUT WELL IT

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:24.215
WAS LIKE CCS SEVEN CALL ONE

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:25.149
PROGRAM RATE THAT REALLY WE HAVE

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:26.751
KIND OF LIKE THREE GROUPS OF

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:27.018
PATIENTS.

00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:28.753
IN THERE RIGHT SO YOU HAVE

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:31.422

COM AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CCS

00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:44.835
BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY A LITTLE

00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:47.905
MORE -- COMMON AND THEN YOU HAVE

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:48.472

LIKE JUST LUMP EVERYONE TOGETHER

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.155
AND AVERAGE IT ALL OUT.

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:05.656

PROGRAM FOR THE OUT LIARS THAT'S

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:16.267
WHY WE HAVE A SEPARATE PROGRAM.

TO GET THAT THAT THAT THAT THE

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:25.710
RARE CONDITIONS AND ESPECIALLY

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:28.679
BECAUSE THE THE SUBGROUP THAT

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:29.146
HAVE THESE REALLY RARE

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:30.815
CONDITIONS.

00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:33.451
YES EVEN THAT -- YOU YEAH THIS

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:35.086
TO BE A PROBABLY I'M LIKELY TO

00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:35.820
HAVE PROVIDE YOU KNOW THE THE

00:37:35.886 --> 00:37:38.089
SPECIALISTS EVEN IN YOUR

00:37:38.155 --> 00:37:39.991
IMMEDIATE AREA MAYBE IF YOU HAVE

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:41.092
YOU KNOW REALLY BIG.

00:37:41.158 --> 00:37:42.860
CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL THAT WORK

BUT THOSE LIKELY IS AND WE NEED

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:46.163
WE SHOULD EVALUATION IS NOT JUST

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.732
AVERAGING EVERYONE OUT ACROSS

00:37:47.798 --> 00:37:51.335
ALL THOSE PATIENTS RIGHT THEY

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:52.136
NEED TO BE LOOKED AT AS A

00:37:52.203 --> 00:37:53.638
SEPARATE.

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:54.672
ENTITIES THOSE THAT HAPPENING

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:55.673
AND EVALUATION.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.808
SO THE RESEARCHERS CAN HAVE

00:37:57.875 --> 00:38:00.244
ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF DATA NOT

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:01.646
SINCE THE TELEPHONE SURVEYS I

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:02.647
DON'T HAVE A VALUATION IN FRONT

00:38:02.713 --> 00:38:04.148
OF HUNDREDS OF PAGES BUT OF

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:05.549
COURSE WE WOULD MAKE

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:06.417
ADMINISTRATIVE DATA.

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:07.685
AVAILABLE TO THEM SO THEY CAN

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:09.453
LOOK AT IT FOR WHATEVER TRENDS

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.591
AND OUT LIARS AND OTHER THINGS

00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:15.259
SO I DON'T.

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:16.794
AND WE WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:17.795
WITH THAT OKAY SO I MIGHT BE

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:19.697
SURE WERE.

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:21.766

SURVEYS AS VALUABLE AS THEY ARE

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:33.330
WE WE BELIEVE A LOT OF THESE

00:40:33.397 --> 00:40:35.499

MY STEP MOTHER -- HAD A SERIOUS

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:20.183
FALL.

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:22.719
SHE WAS SO I THINK SHE WAS.

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:24.654
EIGHTY AND T. SHATTERED HER

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:25.989
FEMUR.

01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:27.824
SHE WAS IN THE SKILLED NURSING

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.393
FACILITY FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.963
BECAUSE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:36.132
SHE WAS A VERY LARGE WOMAN.

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:36.966
SHE HAD TO USE A WHEELCHAIR

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:40.370
UPPERPART OF HER RECOVERY --

AND WE COULDN'T GET.

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:44.540
A WHEELCHAIR INTO HER HOME.

01:00:44.607 --> 01:00:45.775
IN FACT WE COULD GET A

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:47.543
WHEELCHAIR IN HER WE'VE TEAR

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:48.845
INTO MY HOME SO THAT I COULD

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:51.748
CARE FOR HER AT AT HOME EITHER.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.683
SO SHE STAYED THERE FOR MANY

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.485
MANY MONTHS COSTING A HUGE

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:58.755
AMOUNT OF MONEY -- AND THEN

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:01.090
EVENTUALLY HE DID GET HOME.

01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:02.959
CHEN ANOTHER FALL.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.494
WE MOVED HER INTO AN ASSISTED

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.397
LIVING FACILITY CHEN OTHER FALL.

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:09.098
AND THEN SHE WENT.

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:12.201
SO AS STATED -- IN THE IN THE

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:15.071
PROPOSAL IN THE BILL.

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:20.977
SIXTY THE SIXTY BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:22.545
AND WE CAN ESTIMATE BASED ON

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:25.481
PAST HISTORY THAT ONE IN.

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:26.749
THREE PEOPLE OVER SIXTY WILL

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:28.317
HAVE A FALL.

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:29.452
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.354
TRANSLATES INTO A HUGE NUMBERS

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:32.722
OF PEOPLE.

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:34.290
IN CALIFORNIA WHO WILL BE

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:37.360
FALLING AND THE COST OF THOSE

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.028
FILES IT'S GOING.

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:42.098
TO JUST BE EXPONENTIAL.

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:43.199
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:46.936
INTERVENTIONS CAN PREVENT 11223%

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:48.738
OF THOSE FALLS.

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:52.408
SO WE I THINK THIS IS BY MY

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:53.810
OPINION AND I'D LIKE TO STATE.

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.812
THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:59.182
CALIFORNIA HAS A HUMANITARIAN.

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:01.317

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:08.424
I ALSO THINK THEY HAVE A

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:10.026
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY THANK

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:12.495

DIAGNOSED WITH MS AT AGE.

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:24.774
SIXTY BECAUSE IT IS A DISEASE

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:27.743
THAT USUALLY HITS YOUNG ADULTS.

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.679
UNFORTUNATELY BY THE TIME I WAS

01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:31.881
DIAGNOSED I WAS SECONDARY

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:33.249
PROGRESSIVE.

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:36.452
WHICH IS AS BAD AS IT GETS AND I

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:40.690
HAVE PROGRESSED RAPIDLY.

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:42.458

OF IT ALSO.

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:06.649
UNFORTUNATE THAT IT COULD HAVE

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:09.018
BEEN MY HANDS TO MY ARMS BECAUSE

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:10.419
YOU CAN SEE.

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:13.890
I USE THEM.

01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:15.625
WE OVER THE YEARS WE'VE BEEN

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:38.534
ACTUALLY SO I HAVE MET IN MY

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.469
YOUTH -- AS AND YOU KNOW THE

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:42.905
FUTURE SHOULD ACTUALLY WORKED ON

A PROJECT ON ON THE TERATOLOGY

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:47.677
PROJECT -- WE LOOKED AT THE

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:51.480
ISSUE OF FALLS AND I GUESS ANA

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:53.783
IF THIS IS A BUDGET COMMITTEE --

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:56.319
SO THEY DID FALLS DO AND AND

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:58.287
SPECIALLY RELEASED THE FRACTURES --

01:05:58.354 --> 01:05:59.622
UNFORTUNATELY TO INCREASE

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:00.723
MORTALITY NOW RELIES ON A

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.191
BUDGETARY STANDPOINT THAT

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:03.893
DOESN'T NECESSARILY THAT DOESN'T

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:05.361
ALWAYS MEAN MORE MONEY -- BUT

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:06.829
IT'S REALLY THE HUMAN COSTS BUT

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:08.564
ALSO I MEAN I THINK IT'S MORE

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.299
LIKELY PEOPLE MIGHT END UP THAN

01:06:10.366 --> 01:06:12.935
NEEDING TO THE STATE -- NEEDING --

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.370

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:33.522
STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE AT THIS

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:36.359
BY I DO WONDER LIKE FOR EXAMPLE --

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:39.562
THIS IS A FAIRLY SMALL AMOUNT --

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:40.629
I REALIZE -- THAT -- IF YOU SEE

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:41.764
THAT A LOT OF THINGS -- ROAD TO

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:42.998
THE STATE BUDGET BUT IN TERMS OF

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:43.999
THINKING ABOUT HOW HE FALLS YOU

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:44.400
HAVE TO PREVENT.

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:45.634
THAT ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:47.169
RESULTED IN A COSTS THAT WOULD

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:48.537
pBEEN THAT WOULD EXCEED WHAT THIS

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:49.805
REQUEST IS.

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:50.740
AND IF WE WERE ABLE TO SAY THAT

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:52.274
WE ARE ABLE TO PREVENT THAT MANY

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:53.609
FALLS THAT WE SAY THIS IS A COST

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:55.678
NEUTRAL EVEN COST SAVINGS OR

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:56.979
PREVENT MORE FALSE SO.

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:58.280
PEOPLE COULD LOOK AT STUDIES

HOWEVER -- THERE HAVE BEEN --

02:23:34.806 --> 02:23:35.773
KIND OF A FREEZE AND AT A SHIFT

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:37.041
FROM DOING ANY COST REPORTING WE

ALSO HAVE THE SET RATES THAT ARE

02:23:38.776 --> 02:23:40.144
BASED ON THE ALTERNATIVE

02:23:40.211 --> 02:23:41.346
RESIDENTIAL MODEL WHICH IS

02:23:41.412 --> 02:23:43.114

02:23:43.181 --> 02:23:45.984
COMMUNITY -- CARE FACILITIES

02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:47.418
THAT ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH.

02:23:47.485 --> 02:23:48.920
THERE'S ESTABLISHED RATES IN

02:23:48.987 --> 02:23:51.489
THIS IN STATUTE THERE'S ALSO

02:23:51.556 --> 02:23:52.623
RATES THAT ARE BASED ON

02:23:52.690 --> 02:23:55.059
PROVIDERS USUAL AND CUSTOMARY.

02:23:55.126 --> 02:23:56.394
THERE'S RATES THAT ARE TIED TO

02:23:56.461 --> 02:23:58.563
MEDI CAL AND THEN THERE'S ALSO

02:23:58.629 --> 02:24:00.331
RATES THAT ARE NEGOTIATED BY THE

02:24:00.398 --> 02:24:02.967
REGIONAL CENTE -- DURING THE

02:24:03.034 --> 02:24:04.535
TIME WHEN THERE WAS THE

02:24:04.602 --> 02:24:06.671
RECESSION -- THERE WERE A NUMBER

02:24:06.738 --> 02:24:08.840
OF ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN THAT

02:24:08.906 --> 02:24:10.975
ALSO -- KIND OF CONTRIBUTED TO

02:24:11.042 --> 02:24:12.777
THE COMPLEXITIES OF OUR RATES

02:24:12.844 --> 02:24:14.779
SYSTEM ONE WAS RATE FREEZES THE

02:24:14.846 --> 02:24:16.547
OTHER WAS KIND OF MEDIAN RATES

02:24:16.614 --> 02:24:19.283

TO THE BROADER NEGOTIATED RATES.

02:24:20.718 --> 02:24:22.653
DURING THAT TIME IT IT REALLY TO

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.288
KIND OF SET IN PLACE WHERE

02:24:24.355 --> 02:24:26.024
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU WERE AT

02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:27.558
WHAT POINT IN TIME IS KIND OF

02:24:27.625 --> 02:24:29.360
WHERE YOUR RATES WERE

02:24:29.427 --> 02:24:30.795
ESTABLISHED.

02:24:30.862 --> 02:24:32.030
THIS IS KIND OF IMPORTANT AS FAR

02:24:32.096 --> 02:24:34.265
AS WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE

02:24:34.332 --> 02:24:36.467
DIFFERENCE -- KIND OF A

02:24:36.534 --> 02:24:39.070
PARAMETERS OR EQUITIES WITHIN

02:24:39.137 --> 02:24:41.005
EACH OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS --

02:24:41.072 --> 02:24:42.473
ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT I LIKE

02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:43.841
TO GIVE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT

02:24:43.908 --> 02:24:47.045
COMPLEXITY IS WHEN YOU COMPARE --

02:24:47.111 --> 02:24:48.212
ONE REGIONAL CENTER THAT HAS

02:24:48.279 --> 02:24:50.481
RATE SUCH AS SOUTH CENTRAL THAT

02:24:50.548 --> 02:24:51.582
MAY HAVE DIFFERENT RATES THAT

02:24:51.649 --> 02:24:53.117
WERE SET AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND

02:24:53.184 --> 02:24:54.018
YOUR NEIGHBORING REGIONAL

02:24:54.085 --> 02:24:56.187
CENTERS SUCH AS WEST SIDE

02:24:56.254 --> 02:24:57.021
REGIONAL CENTER THAT HAVE HIGHER

02:24:57.088 --> 02:24:57.722
RATES.

02:24:57.789 --> 02:24:59.690
PROVIDERS ARE HARDER TO GO TO

02:24:59.757 --> 02:25:01.659
THAN WITHIN -- THE OTHER

02:25:01.726 --> 02:25:03.628
REGIONAL CENTER SO CONSIDERING

02:25:03.694 --> 02:25:05.396
ADDING AND STAYING IN ALIGNMENT

02:25:05.463 --> 02:25:06.831
WITH KIND OF THE INTENT OF THE

02:25:06.898 --> 02:25:09.100
LANGUAGE WITHIN A. B. X. TWO ONE

02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:10.168
ONE OF THE THINGS IS REALLY KIND

02:25:10.234 --> 02:25:11.502
OF ASSESSING.

02:25:11.569 --> 02:25:13.071
KIND OF OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM SO

02:25:13.137 --> 02:25:14.806
WHEN WE MOVE FORWARD A COUPLE

02:25:14.872 --> 02:25:17.809
YEARS AGO WE HAD A REQUEST FOR

02:25:17.875 --> 02:25:18.876
PROPOSAL THAT WENT OUT -- IS A

NUMBER OF STATES TEN STATES IN

02:25:31.522 --> 02:25:33.157
TOTAL SO BASED ON THEIR

02:25:33.224 --> 02:25:35.093

WHO IS HERE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL

02:25:42.066 --> 02:25:44.302
QUESTIONS SHOULD ANY COME UP

02:25:44.368 --> 02:25:46.404
TODAY IN OUR DISCUSSION -- AGAIN

02:25:46.471 --> 02:25:48.439

CAL SO WHEN YOU REALLY TAKE A

02:26:05.256 --> 02:26:06.090
LOOK AT WHAT IS UNDER THE SCOPE

02:26:06.157 --> 02:26:08.025
OF THE RATE STUDY THAT WAS

02:26:08.092 --> 02:26:09.660
CONSIDERED AND EVALUATED IT WAS

02:26:09.727 --> 02:26:11.395
REALLY ONLY SIXTY DIFFERENT

02:26:11.462 --> 02:26:12.964
SERVICE CODES -- WHICH ALSO

02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:17.535

THEIR EXISTING KIND OF SERVICE

02:26:31.949 --> 02:26:33.251
DELIVERY AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

02:26:33.317 --> 02:26:35.052
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ARE

02:26:35.119 --> 02:26:35.987
THOSE ELEMENTS WHAT ARE THE

02:26:36.053 --> 02:26:37.588
THINGS THAT INFORM KIND OF WHAT

02:26:37.655 --> 02:26:39.123
THEY'RE DOING -- AS FAR AS

02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:40.925
SERVICE DELIVERY NUMBER OF HOURS

02:26:40.992 --> 02:26:42.793
FOR STAFFING WHAT AT THE WAGES

02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.495
WHAT ARE THEIR OVER TIME.

02:26:44.562 --> 02:26:46.531
NOW WE DO WANT -- TO BE AWARE

02:26:46.597 --> 02:26:47.999
THOUGH THAT THAT HAS ONLY ONE

02:26:48.065 --> 02:26:50.368
ELEMENT BECAUSE REALLY THE COST

02:26:50.434 --> 02:26:52.570
OF THOSE SERVICES IS OFTENTIMES

02:26:52.637 --> 02:26:54.438
REFLECTIVE OF WHAT THE RATE THAT

02:26:54.505 --> 02:26:55.673
THEY'RE RECEIVING.

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:58.142
SO IT WASN'T A AN IMPORTANT PART

02:26:58.209 --> 02:26:59.777
OF THE PROCESS OF BEING INFORMED

02:26:59.844 --> 02:27:01.345
BUT ALSO THEN TAKING A LOOK AT

02:27:01.412 --> 02:27:03.114
PUBLISHED DATA THAT WOULD ALSO

02:27:03.181 --> 02:27:04.982
INFORM SO WHEN WE'RE TAKING A

02:27:05.049 --> 02:27:07.185
LOOK AT BLS DATA FOR WAGES IN

02:27:07.251 --> 02:27:08.586
USING OTHER ELEMENTS THAT IS

02:27:08.653 --> 02:27:09.520
GOING TO AND THAT.

02:27:09.587 --> 02:27:11.756
INFORMED THE RATE MODELS WAS

02:27:11.822 --> 02:27:13.491
REALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS PROCESS

02:27:13.558 --> 02:27:15.026
ANOTHER PART OF IT WAS -- BEING

02:27:15.092 --> 02:27:16.394
CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF

02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:18.062
TAKING A LOOK AT HOW CAN WE BE

02:27:18.129 --> 02:27:19.564
TRANSPARENT NOT ONLY IN THE

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:22.066
PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE

02:27:22.133 --> 02:27:23.868
RATE MODELS AND COMPLETING THE

02:27:23.935 --> 02:27:24.969
RATE STUDY.

02:27:25.036 --> 02:27:26.671
BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT AS

02:27:26.737 --> 02:27:28.105
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE MODELS IS

02:27:28.172 --> 02:27:29.507
THIS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE

02:27:29.574 --> 02:27:30.875
TRANSPARENT GOING FORWARD.

02:27:30.942 --> 02:27:32.710
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN BEING ABLE TO

02:27:32.777 --> 02:27:34.245
SEE WITH IN THE ELEMENTS OF THE

02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:35.413
RATE MODELS WHAT ARE THOSE

02:27:35.479 --> 02:27:37.548
PIECES SO BEING ABLE TO SEE

02:27:37.615 --> 02:27:40.084
WHAT'S THE STRUCTURE OF OF STAFF

02:27:40.151 --> 02:27:42.887
COMPENSATION FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS

02:27:42.954 --> 02:27:44.855
THE STRUCTURE THAN.

02:27:44.922 --> 02:27:45.623
FOR KIND OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:46.991
WHAT IS SO STRUCTURE FOR

02:27:47.058 --> 02:27:48.960
OPERATIONS AND SO SHOULD THERE

02:27:49.026 --> 02:27:51.128
BE TO DISCUSSIONS THAT NEEDED TO

02:27:51.195 --> 02:27:52.230
TAKE A LOOK AT A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:27:52.296 --> 02:27:53.331
GRANULAR.

02:27:53.397 --> 02:27:55.132
EVEN IN THE FUTURE SHOULD THE

02:27:55.199 --> 02:27:57.835
RATE -- MODELS BE IMPLEMENTED IT

02:27:57.902 --> 02:28:00.104
WOULD GET -- THE FLEXIBILITY TO

02:28:00.171 --> 02:28:02.607
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW TO ADDRESS SE

02:28:02.673 --> 02:28:04.308
WAGE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE SHOULD

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:06.277
THAT BE A DISCUSSION THAT COULD

02:28:06.344 --> 02:28:08.212
OCCUR -- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

02:28:08.279 --> 02:28:09.847
SURE THAT WE TOOK A LOOK AT KIND

02:28:09.914 --> 02:28:11.315
OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES WHAT

02:28:11.382 --> 02:28:12.817
WERE THE THINGS THAT WERE

02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:14.685
INFLUENCING WEATHER IS WAGES

02:28:14.752 --> 02:28:18.856
HOUSING TRANSPORTATION COST WHAT

02:28:18.923 --> 02:28:19.490
WERE THOSE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:20.591
AND SO THE RATE STUDY ALSO

02:28:20.658 --> 02:28:21.158
REFLECTS THAT.

02:28:21.225 --> 02:28:23.027
AND WHAT IS REFLECTIVE IN IN THE

02:28:23.094 --> 02:28:24.328
MODELING THAT THAT WAS

02:28:24.395 --> 02:28:26.764
ULTIMATELY -- RELEASED IN THE

02:28:26.831 --> 02:28:28.266
RATE STUDY AND MARCH.

02:28:28.332 --> 02:28:29.900
OF THE PROCESS THAT WAS REALLY

02:28:29.967 --> 02:28:32.737
ALSO IMPORTANT WAS MAKING SURE

02:28:32.803 --> 02:28:34.038
THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE

02:28:34.105 --> 02:28:34.605
DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR

02:28:34.672 --> 02:28:35.940
STAKEHOLDERS THERE IS A NUMBER

02:28:36.007 --> 02:28:37.275
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT KIND OF

02:28:37.341 --> 02:28:38.709
VENUES IF YOU WILL.

02:28:38.776 --> 02:28:40.444
THAT ALLOWED FOR THAT DIALOGUE

02:28:40.511 --> 02:28:41.045
AND ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR

02:28:41.112 --> 02:28:42.913
STAKEHOLDERS ONE WAS WITHIN THE

02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:44.949
DS TASK FORCE AND HAVING A RATE

02:28:45.016 --> 02:28:46.584
STUDY WORK GROUP WHICH WAS VERY

02:28:46.651 --> 02:28:47.852
IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:28:47.918 --> 02:28:48.953
INPUT IS.

02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:49.887
TO KIND OF HOW WE WOULD BE

02:28:49.954 --> 02:28:51.889
MOVING FORWARD BUT ALSO THAN

02:28:51.956 --> 02:28:53.557
GIVING US INFORMATION AS TO THE

02:28:53.624 --> 02:28:57.461
PROVIDER -- STUDY THAT WENT OUT --

02:28:57.528 --> 02:29:00.197
SO THOSE THERE WAS A SERVICE

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:02.867
PROVIDER STUDY THAT -- WE HAD --

02:29:02.933 --> 02:29:05.436
RELEASED WE HAD -- EACH OF THE

02:29:05.503 --> 02:29:06.070
THE SAMPLINGS AT THE DIFFERENT

02:29:06.137 --> 02:29:07.171
IN SCOPE SERVICES THAT RESPONDED

02:29:07.238 --> 02:29:08.472
TO THAT -- PART OF THE

02:29:08.539 --> 02:29:09.807
DISCUSSION WITH THE DS TASK

02:29:09.874 --> 02:29:11.709
FORCE WAS ALSO ASKING TO MAKE

02:29:11.776 --> 02:29:14.278
SURE THAT WE WERE VERY AWARE OF

02:29:14.345 --> 02:29:15.546
IT AND I'M.

02:29:15.613 --> 02:29:17.615
MINDFUL OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:29:17.682 --> 02:29:19.517
IS RECEIVING SERVICES CONSUMERS

02:29:19.583 --> 02:29:21.752
AND FAMILIES WHAT WAS IMPORTANT

02:29:21.819 --> 02:29:24.522
TO THEM.

02:29:24.588 --> 02:29:25.823
AND SO AS KIND OF MOVING FORWARD

02:29:25.890 --> 02:29:27.725
WITH THAT WHAT WE DID WAS WE WE

02:29:27.792 --> 02:29:28.993
WORKED WITH BURNS AND ASSOCIATE.

02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:32.229
THEY HAD A SUBCONTRACTOR HSR I

02:29:32.296 --> 02:29:34.465
WHO HAD THEN WORKED WITH SOME

02:29:34.532 --> 02:29:36.567
STAKEHOLDERS TO DESIGNED.

02:29:36.634 --> 02:29:38.969
ASUS A SURVEY OF CONSUMERS AND

02:29:39.036 --> 02:29:40.838
FAMILIES START HAVING SOME

02:29:40.905 --> 02:29:41.939
DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM AND

02:29:42.006 --> 02:29:43.774
UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS IMPORTANT

02:29:43.841 --> 02:29:45.710
TO THE SERVICE DELIVERY --

02:29:45.776 --> 02:29:47.345
COMMON THEMES THAT WE HEARD THAT

02:29:47.411 --> 02:29:48.813
WERE IMPORTANT TO THE SERVICE

02:29:48.879 --> 02:29:50.581
DELIVERY FOR THEM WAS REALLY

02:29:50.648 --> 02:29:52.450
STAFF STABILITY EIGHT MAKING

02:29:52.516 --> 02:29:53.851
SURE THAT STAFF WERE TRAINED.

02:29:53.918 --> 02:29:55.152
MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS THE

02:29:55.219 --> 02:29:57.021
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT HOW COULD

02:29:57.088 --> 02:29:58.923
THAT CAN HELP IMPROVE THE

02:29:58.989 --> 02:29:59.857
QUALITY.

02:29:59.924 --> 02:30:01.859
OF OF THAT SERVICE AND THAT

02:30:01.926 --> 02:30:04.195
EXPERIENCE FOR THAT PERSON --

02:30:04.261 --> 02:30:05.996
ALL OF THAT INFORMATION HELPED

02:30:06.063 --> 02:30:08.332
INFORM ELEMENTS WITHIN THE RATE

02:30:08.399 --> 02:30:10.167
STUDY AND SO WHEN YOU TAKE A

02:30:10.234 --> 02:30:11.268
LOOK AT THE RATE MODELS ARE

02:30:11.335 --> 02:30:13.637
CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT ACTUALLY --

02:30:13.704 --> 02:30:15.906
DO TOUCH ON MANY OF THOSE AREAS

02:30:15.973 --> 02:30:17.174
ONE IS WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

02:30:17.241 --> 02:30:19.110
THE STAFF TRAINING THE RATE

02:30:19.176 --> 02:30:20.678
MODELS -- DO REFLECT ON

02:30:20.745 --> 02:30:22.480
COMPONENTS FOR REQUIREMENTS FOR

02:30:22.546 --> 02:30:23.948
STAFF TRAINING ON AN ANNUAL

02:30:24.014 --> 02:30:26.817
BASIS IT ALSO INCLUDES --

02:30:26.884 --> 02:30:28.919
DISCUSSION AS TO THE ASSUMPTION

02:30:28.986 --> 02:30:30.054
THAT THE STAFF TRAINING WOULD

02:30:30.121 --> 02:30:32.490
INCLUDE SOME CULTURAL COMPETENCY.

02:30:32.556 --> 02:30:34.258
AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE THAT

02:30:34.325 --> 02:30:36.293
WAS -- INCLUDED AND THAT WAS

02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:38.629
ADDRESSING THE UNDERSTANDING OF

02:30:38.696 --> 02:30:41.332
BILINGUAL STIPENDS YOU KNOW FOR

02:30:41.399 --> 02:30:43.734
ON THE COMMUNITIES THAT -- TO

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:46.804
HAVE LANGUAGE ACCESS TO INCLUDE

02:30:46.871 --> 02:30:47.838
A SL.

02:30:47.905 --> 02:30:49.507
SO THOSE WERE SOME SOME PIECES

02:30:49.573 --> 02:30:53.778
THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE --

02:30:53.844 --> 02:30:54.678
WITHIN THE CONSIDERATION O THE

02:30:54.745 --> 02:30:57.648
DEVELOPMENT OF OF THE MODELS --

02:30:57.715 --> 02:30:59.884
WE ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:30:59.950 --> 02:31:02.920
WE WERE RECOGNIZE SEEN KIND OF

02:31:02.987 --> 02:31:04.522
THE DIFFERENCES IN THE DIFFERENT

02:31:04.588 --> 02:31:05.589
TYPES OF SETTINGS SO WHAT ARE

02:31:05.656 --> 02:31:09.960
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT NEEDED --

02:31:10.027 --> 02:31:11.195
TO INFORM US AND THAT IS WHERE

02:31:11.262 --> 02:31:12.997
HAVING FURTHER ENGAGEMENT WITH

02:31:13.063 --> 02:31:14.632
OUR STAKEHOLDERS WAS IMPORTANT.

02:31:14.698 --> 02:31:16.667
SO WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:31:16.734 --> 02:31:17.802
MEET WITH A NUMBER OF THE

02:31:17.868 --> 02:31:20.171
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND

02:31:20.237 --> 02:31:25.242
ADVOCACY GROUPS. TO MAKE SURE

02:31:25.309 --> 02:31:25.776
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE

02:31:25.843 --> 02:31:26.844
POINTED CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE

02:31:26.911 --> 02:31:28.379
IMPORTANT TO PARTICULAR SERVICE

02:31:28.446 --> 02:31:29.747
KIND OF CATEGORIES IF YOU WILL.

02:31:29.814 --> 02:31:31.182
THE OTHER THE OTHER PART THAT I

02:31:31.248 --> 02:31:32.583
THOUGHT WAS REALLY HELPFUL WAS

02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:33.918
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE OUR

02:31:33.984 --> 02:31:35.453
CONSULTANTS GO OUT AND VISIT

02:31:35.519 --> 02:31:36.187
PROGRAMS.

02:31:36.253 --> 02:31:37.755
THAT THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THE

02:31:37.822 --> 02:31:40.491
PROGRAMS AND OF OF THE WHOLE

02:31:40.558 --> 02:31:42.359
PICTURE OF IT ALL WE CAN'T HAVE

02:31:42.426 --> 02:31:44.094
A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHEN WE

02:31:44.161 --> 02:31:45.796
TAKE A LOOK AND DO AN EVALUATION

02:31:45.863 --> 02:31:47.264
OF OUR SYSTEM.

02:31:47.331 --> 02:31:48.666
AND THE RATES IS UNDERSTANDING

02:31:48.732 --> 02:31:49.967
WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN

02:31:50.034 --> 02:31:51.435
STATUTE AND THEN WHAT ARE THE

02:31:51.502 --> 02:31:52.736
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE WITHIN

02:31:52.803 --> 02:31:55.306
REGULATION SO THERE WAS ALSO WE

02:31:55.372 --> 02:31:56.974
ALSO DID A FULL SCOPE REVIEW OF

02:31:57.041 --> 02:31:58.676
OUR REGULATIONS AND STATUTES TO

02:31:58.742 --> 02:31:59.910
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALSO BEING

02:31:59.977 --> 02:32:01.278
VERY MINDFUL OF THOSE

02:32:01.345 --> 02:32:02.546
REQUIREMENTS.

02:32:02.613 --> 02:32:04.748
SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

02:32:04.815 --> 02:32:06.150
BUT I DID WANT TO PROVIDE YOU

02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:07.284
KIND OF THAT.

02:32:07.351 --> 02:32:08.752
THAT -- REVIEW WE DID -- DO A

02:32:08.819 --> 02:32:10.321
RELEASE WE WE WALK THROUGH THE

02:32:10.387 --> 02:32:12.022
MODELS WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS

02:32:12.089 --> 02:32:13.691
WENT WITH TWO PRETTY IMPORTANT

02:32:13.757 --> 02:32:15.159
MEETINGS ONE ONE IN THE NORTH

02:32:15.226 --> 02:32:16.694
ONE IN THE SOUTH.

02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:17.495
AND THEN WE'RE STILL IN THE COMP

02:32:17.561 --> 02:32:19.497
WE WE HAVE THE COMMENTS FROM THE

02:32:19.563 --> 02:32:22.032
COMMUNITY AND THE INPUT FROM THE

02:32:22.099 --> 02:32:23.467
PARTICULAR GROUPS THAT HAVE

02:32:23.534 --> 02:32:24.802
SUBMITTED THEM.

02:32:24.869 --> 02:32:27.338
WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

02:32:27.404 --> 02:32:28.772
REVIEWING ALL OF THOSE COMMENTS.

02:32:28.839 --> 02:32:30.441
THERE'S A LOT OF THEM AND WE

02:32:30.508 --> 02:32:32.743
STILL NEED TO CONTINUE -- TO GO

02:32:32.810 --> 02:32:33.978
THROUGH THAT PROCESS TO MAKE

02:32:34.044 --> 02:32:37.047
SURE THAT WE CAN BE INFORMED AS

02:32:37.114 --> 02:32:39.783
TO WHAT THAT TELLS US WITHIN THE

02:32:39.850 --> 02:32:41.151
EXISTING MODELS AND THE

02:32:41.218 --> 02:32:42.353
ASSUMPTIONS THAT THAT WERE PUT

02:32:42.419 --> 02:32:44.421
FORWARD.

02:32:44.488 --> 02:32:46.757
THANK YOU -- ACTUALLY BEFORE

02:32:46.824 --> 02:32:48.659
MOVEON MATES THAT AND AND DID

02:32:48.726 --> 02:32:50.127
YOU ANSWER IT OUR FINANCE

02:32:50.194 --> 02:32:51.362
ANSWERS SO UP SEE THAT MAY

02:32:51.428 --> 02:32:53.030
REVISED CAME OUT FROM THE

02:32:53.097 --> 02:32:54.832
GOVERNOR SO WHAT IS THE SO WE

02:32:54.899 --> 02:32:56.500
HAVE THE RACE TO THE OTHERS WERE

02:32:56.567 --> 02:32:57.735
HAVING HEARING ON IT RIGHT NOW.

02:32:57.801 --> 02:33:00.104
WHAT IS A PROPOSAL FOR THIS

02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:03.407
COMING YEAR IN REGARDS TO WHAT

02:33:03.474 --> 02:33:03.974
WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THE RATE

02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:06.043

BEST WAY TO HAVE THAT SUSTAINING

02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:36.253
IS TO RECONNECT ACOSTA SERVICES

THE IMPACTS OF NEW RATES IN NEW

02:41:49.633 --> 02:41:51.101
RATE SETTING METHODOLOGY IS THE

THERE IS SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL

02:42:16.093 --> 02:42:17.294
FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG WITH THE

02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:18.528

I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A

02:46:07.357 --> 02:46:07.957
BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE RATE STUDY

02:46:08.024 --> 02:46:08.925
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

BASICALLY THREE OVER ARCHING --

02:46:23.673 --> 02:46:32.816
AREAS THAT WE'D LIKE TO DRAW

02:46:32.882 --> 02:46:34.351
ATTENTION -- TO MAINLY IT'S THE

02:46:34.417 --> 02:46:35.051
ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE'VE

02:46:35.118 --> 02:46:36.519
IDENTIFIED WITH IN THE STUDY AND

02:46:36.586 --> 02:46:38.254
THAT THOSE ASSUMPTIONS NEED TO

02:46:38.321 --> 02:46:38.955
BE FULLY.

02:46:39.022 --> 02:46:39.989
THAT IT BEFORE ADOPTED WE HAVE

FOR A CONSIDERATION.

02:46:45.895 --> 02:46:47.030
OUR FIRST AND MOST EGREGIOUS

ASSUMPTION IN THE STUDY THAT WE

02:46:48.531 --> 02:46:50.433
BELIEVE IS THE D. S. P. WAGE --

02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:52.869
RATE -- AND THE B. S. I'LL BE LS

02:46:52.936 --> 02:46:54.237
DOT AND WHICH WAS DEVELOPED.

02:46:54.304 --> 02:47:14.124
MORE THAN 80% OF ALL THE FUNDING --

02:47:14.190 --> 02:47:15.825
THAT WE HAVE IS DEVOTED TO

02:47:15.892 --> 02:47:17.660

THEY'RE FORGETTING THIS

02:47:21.097 --> 02:47:21.898
ASSUMPTION RIGHT AT THE START

02:47:21.965 --> 02:47:22.832
MUST BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF ALL

02:47:22.899 --> 02:47:23.433
WE DO.

02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:24.067
CURRENTLY THE RATE STUDY BILLS

02:47:24.134 --> 02:47:28.838
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM ACROSS

02:47:28.905 --> 02:47:29.139
CALIFORNIA.

02:47:34.744 --> 02:47:36.913
FAR EXCEED THIS BASIC CUSTODIAL

02:47:36.980 --> 02:47:37.714
CARE.

02:47:37.781 --> 02:47:39.182
IN THE SETTINGS RULE ITSELF IT

02:47:39.249 --> 02:47:40.417
STATES THAT WE SHOULD PROVIDE

02:47:40.483 --> 02:47:41.751

SETTING OF THEIR CHOOSING.

02:47:51.528 --> 02:47:53.596
THE LETTERMAN ACT ITSELF STATES

02:47:53.663 --> 02:47:54.964
PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES

02:47:55.031 --> 02:47:56.299
AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE A RIGHT

02:47:56.366 --> 02:47:57.567
TO GET SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THE

02:47:57.634 --> 02:48:13.683
NEED

02:48:15.018 --> 02:48:16.219
TO LIVE LIKE PEOPLE WHO

02:48:16.286 --> 02:48:17.220
DON'T HAVE DISABILITIES.

02:48:17.287 --> 02:48:18.922
IF THE RATES OF REIMBURSEMENT

02:48:18.988 --> 02:48:19.989
ARE SENATE TOILETING BEATING AND

02:48:20.056 --> 02:48:20.657
FEEDING THEN WE MUST ASK

02:48:20.723 --> 02:48:21.591
OURSELVES IF THE END RESULT WILL

02:48:21.658 --> 02:48:22.225
BE TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT WILL

02:48:22.292 --> 02:48:23.593
ONLY SPEED AND WAREHOUSE PEOPLE.

02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:24.627
RATHER THAN A INNOVATIVE AND

02:48:24.694 --> 02:48:25.261
NIBBLED NETWORK OF SUPPORTS AND

02:48:25.328 --> 02:48:26.162

INDEPENDENCE INCREASE AND

02:48:27.263 --> 02:48:27.764
EMPLOYABILITY.

02:48:27.831 --> 02:48:28.998
THE LA COALITION HAS PROVIDED AN

02:48:29.065 --> 02:48:30.433
ALTERNATIVE D. S. P. WAGE BASED

02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:31.835
ON DEALS BLS DATA.

02:48:31.901 --> 02:48:32.402
THAT MIRRORS THE DUTIES AND

02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:35.572
EXPECTATIONS OF THIS WORK FORCE

02:48:35.638 --> 02:48:35.805
WHO GOT.

02:48:35.872 --> 02:48:37.807
DONE.

02:48:37.874 --> 02:48:40.076
YES WITH THAT TWO MINUTES YOUR

02:48:40.143 --> 02:48:42.312
THREE MINUTES AFTER THREE

02:48:42.378 --> 02:48:42.846
MINUTES NOW OKAY.

02:48:42.912 --> 02:48:43.446
RIGHT.

02:48:43.513 --> 02:48:45.181
THAT WAS OUR MOST EGREGIOUS ONE

02:48:45.248 --> 02:48:46.349
SAID THE DS AT THE D. S. P.

02:48:46.416 --> 02:48:48.751
WAGES IF WE CAN FOCUS ON THAT.

02:48:48.818 --> 02:48:50.720
OKAY YET TO OTHER I DID HE JUST

02:48:50.787 --> 02:49:08.104
SAY WHAT THEY ARE REGULARLY AND

02:49:08.171 --> 02:49:11.741

02:49:12.909 --> 02:49:13.710
NATION OF SERVICE CATEGORIES --

02:49:13.776 --> 02:49:15.912
IS REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT --

02:49:15.979 --> 02:49:18.481
TO FOR OUR COALITION ALONE IT

02:49:18.548 --> 02:49:19.449
WILL BE ELIMINATION OF MANY.

02:49:19.516 --> 02:49:20.917
AND AGAIN -- BACK TO WHAT IS

02:49:20.984 --> 02:49:21.518
ALREADY BEEN SAID AND THAT IS

02:49:21.584 --> 02:49:22.385
TAKE TIME TO FULLY THAT THE

02:49:22.452 --> 02:49:26.456
STUDY BEFORE -- ANY HARM

02:49:26.523 --> 02:49:27.690
COMPRISED OF THE PERSONAL

02:49:27.757 --> 02:49:29.292
SUPPORT OF SUPPORTED LIVING

02:49:29.359 --> 02:49:31.427
INDEPENDENT LIVING AND RESPITE.

02:49:31.494 --> 02:49:33.296
THESE SERVICES COMPRISE OF MORE

02:49:33.363 --> 02:49:36.065
THAN 55% OF TH DDS CASELOAD AND

02:49:36.132 --> 02:49:36.799
WE KIND OF GAVE YOU THAT

02:49:36.866 --> 02:49:38.368
DOCUMENT DIRECTLY FROM THE FACT

02:49:38.434 --> 02:49:39.769
SHEET FROM DDS.

02:49:39.836 --> 02:49:41.304
WE BELIEVE THE WORK CONDUCTED BY

02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:43.439
BURGE ASSOCIATE AND DEVELOPING

02:49:43.506 --> 02:49:45.241
RATE TO SOUND AND THE PROCESS

02:49:45.308 --> 02:49:46.709
STRIVE TO DEVELOP TRANSPARENT

02:49:46.776 --> 02:49:48.411
RATE STRUCTURES WHAT WE BELIEVE

02:49:48.478 --> 02:49:49.879
A CRITICAL ASPECT OF ALL OF THIS

02:49:49.946 --> 02:49:51.915
IS THE DEVELOPMENT AND

02:49:51.981 --> 02:49:53.816
IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RATES.

02:49:53.883 --> 02:49:55.952
IS THE POLICY DECISIONS ON HOW

02:49:56.019 --> 02:49:58.154
WE GUIDE OURSELVES AND WE ENACT

02:49:58.221 --> 02:49:59.956
THESE RATES CALIFORNIA IS A

02:50:00.023 --> 02:50:01.391
GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SEIZE THE

02:50:01.457 --> 02:50:02.759
MOMENT OF THIS STUDY AND USE

02:50:02.825 --> 02:50:03.826
THIS NEW STRUCTURE.

02:50:03.893 --> 02:50:05.528
NOT JUST TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS

02:50:05.595 --> 02:50:07.697
QUO BUT TO BUILD A SYSTEM THAT

02:50:07.764 --> 02:50:10.266
EMPHASIZES VALUES AND INDIVIDUAL

02:50:10.333 --> 02:50:12.001
OUTCOMES AND CHOICE.

02:50:12.068 --> 02:50:13.303
HOW THESE MODELS ARE IMPLEMENTED

02:50:13.369 --> 02:50:14.470
WILL BE INDICATIVE OF THE KIND

02:50:14.537 --> 02:50:17.073
OF CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO HAVE

02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:18.007
FOR A FUTURE?

02:50:18.074 --> 02:50:19.576
NATIONALLY COLLECTED DATA SHOWS

02:50:19.642 --> 02:50:20.843
THAT INDEPENDENT LIVING AND

02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:22.812
SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES HAVE

02:50:22.879 --> 02:50:24.180
BEEN INCREASING 3%.

02:50:24.247 --> 02:50:26.816
ACROSS ALL STATES.

02:50:26.883 --> 02:50:28.384
THIS IS BEEN OVER THE LAST FIVE

02:50:28.451 --> 02:50:29.252
YEARS THESE ARE THE CHOSEN

02:50:29.319 --> 02:50:31.287
PROGRAMS WE APPRECIATE THE

02:50:31.354 --> 02:50:32.488
RECOGNITION OF THAT AND THE

02:50:32.555 --> 02:50:34.123
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:35.024
BUT WE DO AGREE WITH THE BLS

02:50:35.091 --> 02:50:37.026
DATA AROUND INDEPENDENT LIVING

02:50:37.093 --> 02:50:39.062
SERVICES WE HAVE THE SUBMITTED

02:50:39.128 --> 02:50:41.564
COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO THAT.

02:50:41.631 --> 02:50:42.398
AND WE NEED TO WORK WITH BURKE

02:50:42.465 --> 02:50:43.900
BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS MORE

02:50:43.967 --> 02:50:45.635
WE ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

02:50:45.702 --> 02:50:46.970
PART OF THAT CONTINUUM IS

02:50:47.036 --> 02:50:47.837
RESPITE.

02:50:47.904 --> 02:50:50.006
AND INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES

02:50:50.073 --> 02:50:51.841
THESE PROGRAMS WORK HAND IN HAND

02:50:51.908 --> 02:50:54.043
FROM CHILD TO THOSE WHO MAY NOT

02:50:54.110 --> 02:50:55.411
NEED AS MUCH SUPPORT ALL OF

02:50:55.478 --> 02:50:56.679
THESE ARE H. CBS COMPLIANT

02:50:56.746 --> 02:50:58.147
PROGRAMS.

02:50:58.214 --> 02:51:00.149
RESPITE ADMIN RATE WAS REMOVED

02:51:00.216 --> 02:51:01.784
IN A AN EMPLOYER OF RECORD AND

02:51:01.851 --> 02:51:03.186
THAT SHOULD BE BACK AND THE

02:51:03.252 --> 02:51:05.455
OTHER THING IS -- WE DID READ

02:51:05.521 --> 02:51:07.423
THE LA OWES -- INFORMATION IN

02:51:07.490 --> 02:51:08.491
REGARDS TO SUPPORT A LIVING

02:51:08.558 --> 02:51:10.693
SERVICES WE DO BELIEVE THAT

02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:12.095
MOVING FOR WITH AN HOURLY RATE

02:51:12.161 --> 02:51:13.162
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:51:13.229 --> 02:51:14.297
DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL

02:51:14.364 --> 02:51:16.199
SERVICES HAS ALREADY DONE SO

02:51:16.265 --> 02:51:17.967
WITH -- SAN ANDREAS REGIONAL

02:51:18.034 --> 02:51:19.736
CENTER GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL

02:51:19.802 --> 02:51:21.904
CENTER AND ALL TO CALIFORNIA

02:51:21.971 --> 02:51:23.139
REGIONAL CENTER IN NORTH BAY

02:51:23.206 --> 02:51:29.379
AUDITOR'S DO NOT LIKE.

02:51:29.445 --> 02:51:31.047
RATES THAT ARE NOT HOURLY WE ARE

02:51:31.114 --> 02:51:32.382
ACCESS WE WERE TOLD ACCESS TO

02:51:32.448 --> 02:51:33.483
GENERIC RESOURCE I HSS THAT IS

02:51:33.549 --> 02:51:34.384
HOURLY AND YET WE HAVE COMPLETE

02:51:34.450 --> 02:51:35.718
COMPLICATED CONVOLUTED RATE

02:51:35.785 --> 02:51:36.019
STRUCTURES.

02:51:36.085 --> 02:51:37.387
AT HOURLY RATE SEEMS TO BE THE

02:51:37.453 --> 02:51:39.288
RATE THAT NEEDS TO BE HAPPENING

02:51:39.355 --> 02:51:40.723
SO WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT WAS

02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:42.158
RECOMMENDED AND THE BIRDS AND

02:51:42.225 --> 02:51:44.260
ASSOCIATES -- I THINK THAT PART

02:51:44.327 --> 02:51:45.795
OF THIS IS ALSO.

02:51:45.862 --> 02:51:46.996

SO YOU HAD A RATE STUDY DONE

02:51:55.004 --> 02:51:55.805
YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN A PRESCRIPTION.

02:51:55.872 --> 02:51:57.073
THE QUESTION IS IS ARE YOU TO

POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WE

02:52:01.077 --> 02:52:02.679
ARE DOING A DROP SMALL STEP

02:52:02.745 --> 02:52:04.881
FORWARD WE ALL HAVE ISSUES

02:52:04.947 --> 02:52:05.915
AROUND HOW WE WANT TO MOVE

02:52:05.982 --> 02:52:07.350

THIS RATE IS IT ACCEPTABLE IT'S

02:52:13.022 --> 02:52:14.524
NOT ACCEPTABLE IS IT BETTER THAN

02:52:14.590 --> 02:52:16.325
WHAT WE HAVE WHICH IS A PATHETIC

02:52:16.392 --> 02:52:17.593

OF GOOD THINGS IN THE STUDY

02:52:37.447 --> 02:52:38.815
WE'RE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE

02:52:38.881 --> 02:52:40.216

02:52:45.221 --> 02:52:47.490
QUICK THINGS COMPLEXITY THE

02:52:47.557 --> 02:52:49.125
STUDY IS BIKE WERE RUNNING --

02:52:49.192 --> 02:52:50.760
WORKING ON A BASEBALL FIELD NOW

02:52:50.827 --> 02:52:52.595

IT'S SAYING FEEL THE LOOKS

02:52:53.229 --> 02:52:54.297
SIMILAR THE RULES ARE COMPLETELY

02:52:54.363 --> 02:52:56.365
DIFFERENT SO QUICK EXAMPLE I

02:52:56.432 --> 02:52:57.200
USED TO HAVE SOMEONE COME RIGHT

02:52:57.266 --> 02:52:59.936
PROGRAM THAT WE HAD ONE RATE FOR

02:53:00.002 --> 02:53:00.570
SIX HOURS NOW THE SAME PERSON

02:53:00.636 --> 02:53:01.237
COMES.

02:53:01.304 --> 02:53:02.538
I RATE FOR THE FOUR HOURS THERE

02:53:02.605 --> 02:53:03.940
WITH US I HAVE A DIFFERENT RATE

02:53:04.006 --> 02:53:04.741
FOR THE TWO HOURS THEY GO IN THE

02:53:04.807 --> 02:53:06.075
COMMUNITY I HAVE A ONE ON ONE

02:53:06.142 --> 02:53:08.177
AID FOR MEALS WITH THE NEW RATE

02:53:08.244 --> 02:53:09.946
I HAVE A A BEHAVIORAL EIGHT FOR

02:53:10.012 --> 02:53:10.580
TWO HOURS WITH THE NEW RATE.

02:53:10.646 --> 02:53:12.081
IT'S GOOD STUFF BUT BOY IT'S

02:53:12.148 --> 02:53:13.349
GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO

02:53:13.416 --> 02:53:15.451
LAYER ALL THE STUFF IN TO REDO

02:53:15.518 --> 02:53:16.619
INDIVIDUAL PLANS FOR EVERY

02:53:16.686 --> 02:53:17.487
SINGLE PERSON.

02:53:17.553 --> 02:53:18.888
FIGURE OUT THE SYSTEMS TO MAKE

02:53:18.955 --> 02:53:20.890
THAT WORK SECOND WE HAVE A LOT

02:53:20.957 --> 02:53:22.525
OF INDIVIDUAL ASSUMPTIONS WITHIN

02:53:22.592 --> 02:53:24.360
CURRENT CORRECT THEY HAVE ABOUT

02:53:24.427 --> 02:53:25.995
A HUNDRED PAGES OF NOTES FOR YOU.

02:53:26.062 --> 02:53:28.664
ON THAT THE WILL PASS NOT TWENTY

02:53:28.731 --> 02:53:29.298
ONE HUNDRED PAGES LIKE THE RATE

02:53:29.365 --> 02:53:30.133
STUDY BUT WE'RE GETTING THERE

02:53:30.199 --> 02:53:31.501
THERE'S A MISSING SERVICES THAT

02:53:31.567 --> 02:53:33.603
REBEKAH TOUCHED ON PROJECTS

02:53:33.669 --> 02:53:34.270
SEARCHES AND IN THERE.

02:53:34.337 --> 02:53:35.404
WE HAVE A LOT O PEOPLE IN THE

02:53:35.471 --> 02:53:37.173
COMMUNITY AND ONE TO FOUR RATIO

02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:38.341
IS THAT'S NO LONGER ALLOWED WE

02:53:38.407 --> 02:53:39.475
THINK THAT NEEDS TO GET FIXED

02:53:39.542 --> 02:53:40.443
AND THEN THE BIGGEST PROBLEM

02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:42.645
WITH A PROGRAMS IS THE RATE FOR

02:53:42.712 --> 02:53:43.179
THE DSP.

02:53:43.246 --> 02:53:44.547
THAT WERE BACK I GOT INTO THIS

02:53:44.614 --> 02:53:46.048
BUT THE INDIVIDUAL THE IT'S A

02:53:46.115 --> 02:53:48.184
PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH TO THE

02:53:48.251 --> 02:53:49.418
RATE STUDY SAYS WE'RE ABOUT TO

02:53:49.485 --> 02:53:50.987
STUDIO CARE FOR ABOUT FEEDING

02:53:51.053 --> 02:53:53.089
PEOPLE HOUSING PEOPLE AND JUST

02:53:53.156 --> 02:53:54.690
TAKING CARE THEIR BASIC NEEDS WE

02:53:54.757 --> 02:53:56.025
AS PROVIDERS WOULD SAY WE'RE

02:53:56.092 --> 02:53:59.061
ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE BECOME

02:53:59.128 --> 02:54:00.463
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH

02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:02.331
OUR VISION IS THAT OUR APPROACH

02:54:02.398 --> 02:54:04.066
LEADS TO LESS NEED FOR STATE

02:54:04.133 --> 02:54:05.735
SUPPORT ON AN ONGOING BASIS

02:54:05.802 --> 02:54:07.336
BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVING TO

02:54:07.403 --> 02:54:08.404
INDEPENDENCE AND PLAY BILLION

02:54:08.471 --> 02:54:10.006
PLAYING TAXES.

02:54:10.072 --> 02:54:12.241
THE RATE STUDY PUSHES US OUT A

02:54:12.308 --> 02:54:14.710
MODEL JUST ONGOING CUSTODIAL

02:54:14.777 --> 02:54:16.479
CARE FOR FOR KIND EVER MORE --

02:54:16.546 --> 02:54:17.847
IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT.

02:54:17.914 --> 02:54:19.215
ARE WE LIKE THAT THEIR RATES FOR

02:54:19.282 --> 02:54:20.583
JOB DEVELOPMENT IN THERE.

02:54:20.650 --> 02:54:21.617
THERE ARE SOME REAL ASSUMPTIONS

02:54:21.684 --> 02:54:23.152
THAT ARE WRONG SO WE'RE SAYING

02:54:23.219 --> 02:54:24.720
CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT FOR

02:54:24.787 --> 02:54:26.722
STATE BUT RIGHT NOW THE NEW RATE

02:54:26.789 --> 02:54:34.197
PROPOSES LOWER.

02:54:34.263 --> 02:54:35.765
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE LESS

02:54:35.832 --> 02:54:36.766
RESOURCES FOR THIS BUT THERE IF

02:54:36.833 --> 02:54:38.034
IT'S BECAUSE THEIR ASSUMPTIONS

02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:38.835
THE WRONG SO TOO QUICK

02:54:38.901 --> 02:54:39.769
ASSUMPTIONS ONE IS THAT THEY DO

02:54:39.836 --> 02:54:40.603
INCLUDE ANY SUPERVISION EVERY

02:54:40.670 --> 02:54:41.437
SERVICE NEED SUPERVISION

02:54:41.504 --> 02:54:42.305
EVERYTHING ELSE INCLUDED IT IT

02:54:42.371 --> 02:54:42.905
MUST OF BEEN AN OVERSIGHT THE

02:54:42.972 --> 02:54:43.506
SECOND IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA

02:54:43.573 --> 02:54:44.140
LEGISLATURE REQUIRES.

02:54:44.207 --> 02:54:45.708
A REST BREAKS UNINTERRUPTED REST

02:54:45.775 --> 02:54:47.710
BREAK SMALL THING IT'S NOT IN

02:54:47.777 --> 02:54:48.544
THE STUDY WE HAVE TO DO THOSE BY

02:54:48.611 --> 02:54:50.813
LAW CHANGE THOSE TWO THINGS THE

02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:52.648
RATE GOES UP 17%.

02:54:52.715 --> 02:54:53.749
SOME OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE

02:54:53.816 --> 02:54:54.984
WRONG THEY'VE ELEVEN MINUTES PER

02:54:55.051 --> 02:54:57.286
DAY TRAVEL TIME WE REQUIRE IT'S

02:54:57.353 --> 02:54:58.988
A LOT MORE IN REALITY.

02:54:59.055 --> 02:55:00.323
THE DSP WAGES WRONG

02:55:00.389 --> 02:55:01.090
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD HAVE BEN

02:55:01.157 --> 02:55:03.459
CUT 212% FIX ALL THOSE PROBLEMS

02:55:03.526 --> 02:55:05.962
THE RATE GOES UP 69% SO THERE

02:55:06.028 --> 02:55:06.996
ARE SOME REAL THINGS THEY CAN

02:55:07.063 --> 02:55:08.698
ADJUST THESE RATES THAT NEED TO

02:55:08.764 --> 02:55:10.199
GET FACTORED IN IN THE COMMENTS

02:55:10.266 --> 02:55:11.701
AND HOPEFULLY DDS WILL ISSUE A

02:55:11.767 --> 02:55:12.535
NEW.

02:55:12.602 --> 02:55:13.970
REVISED VERSION OF THAT AND THEN

02:55:14.036 --> 02:55:16.505
LASTLY QUICKLY ON TRANSPORTATION.

02:55:16.572 --> 02:55:18.207
I TALKED TO A PROVIDER WHO WHO

02:55:18.274 --> 02:55:19.742
DOES THIS HE SAYS THEY PROVIDE

02:55:19.809 --> 02:55:21.177
TRANSPORTATION FOR THREE HUNDRED

02:55:21.244 --> 02:55:21.944
PEOPLE THE NEW RATES WILL CAUSE

02:55:22.011 --> 02:55:23.312
THEM TO LOSE ONE POINT TWO

02:55:23.379 --> 02:55:25.047
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY JUST ON

02:55:25.114 --> 02:55:25.948
TRANSPORTATION.

02:55:26.015 --> 02:55:26.816
THEY WOULD STOP ALL

02:55:26.883 --> 02:55:28.017
TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND

02:55:28.084 --> 02:55:29.151
WE'VE HEARD THAT ANECDOTALLY

02:55:29.218 --> 02:55:30.786
FROM A LOT OF OTHERS SO THERE

02:55:30.853 --> 02:55:32.321
ARE SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO GET

02:55:32.388 --> 02:55:33.723
LOOKED AT IN THE TRANSPORTATION

02:55:33.789 --> 02:55:37.493
FILTER.

02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:39.462
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.

02:55:51.307 --> 02:55:52.942
AND I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS MY

02:55:53.009 --> 02:55:54.343
CONCERN WITH THE PROPOSED

02:55:54.410 --> 02:55:55.878
CHANGES SPECIFICALLY TO EARLY

02:55:55.945 --> 02:55:59.115
INTERVENTION SERVICE CODE --

02:55:59.181 --> 02:55:59.982
EIGHT OH FIVE PER WHICH PROVIDE

02:56:00.049 --> 02:56:02.318
SERVICES TO CHILDREN FROM BIRTH

02:56:02.385 --> 02:56:02.952
TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS EITHER AT

02:56:03.019 --> 02:56:04.253
HOME OR IN A CENTER BASED

02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:05.521
PROGRAM.

02:56:05.588 --> 02:56:07.256
JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND ABOUT

02:56:07.323 --> 02:56:08.891
ME I DID MY INTERNSHIP AND

02:56:08.958 --> 02:56:10.860
RESIDENCY AT KAISER FELLOWSHIP

02:56:10.927 --> 02:56:13.496
AT UCLA I WORKED IN A VARIETY OF

02:56:13.562 --> 02:56:14.764
SETTINGS INCLUDING CHILDREN'S

02:56:14.830 --> 02:56:16.766
HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES LA UNIFIED

02:56:16.832 --> 02:56:17.833
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:21.037
AND PARTICULARLY AS A PHYSICIAN

02:56:21.103 --> 02:56:23.873
WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER -- I'M

02:56:23.940 --> 02:56:25.174
NOW AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A

02:56:25.241 --> 02:56:26.876
NONPROFIT AGENCY THAT PROVIDES

02:56:26.943 --> 02:56:28.377
SERVICES TO CHILDREN BIRTH

02:56:28.444 --> 02:56:30.680
THROUGH TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE.

02:56:30.746 --> 02:56:32.148
AND WE DO HAVE AN EIGHT OH FIVE

02:56:32.214 --> 02:56:34.216
EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM THAT

02:56:34.283 --> 02:56:35.484
WE'VE HAD FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS.

02:56:35.551 --> 02:56:36.919
SO HAVE A LOT OF YEARS IN THIS

02:56:36.986 --> 02:56:38.087
FIELD.

02:56:38.154 --> 02:56:40.489
OVER THE YEARS -- BEST PRACTICES

02:56:40.556 --> 02:56:41.924
FOR EARLY INTERVENTION HAVE BEEN

02:56:41.991 --> 02:56:45.328
WELL ESTABLISHED ESPECIALLY THE

02:56:45.394 --> 02:56:47.263
PRACTICE OF INTERDISCIPLINARY

02:56:47.330 --> 02:56:48.431
WORK.

02:56:48.497 --> 02:56:50.967
OVER TIME DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING

02:56:51.033 --> 02:56:53.169
CHANGES IN ELIGIBILITY OF OTHER

02:56:53.235 --> 02:56:54.670
PEOPLE OF ALLUDED.

02:56:54.737 --> 02:56:56.038
TO MANY EARLY INTERVENTION

02:56:56.105 --> 02:56:58.074
PROGRAMS OF HAD TO CLOSE.

02:56:58.140 --> 02:57:00.343
NOW THE PROPOSED RATE STRUCTURE

02:57:00.409 --> 02:57:02.411
I BELIEVE IS ANOTHER THREAT TO

02:57:02.478 --> 02:57:03.679
EARLY INTERVENTION.

02:57:03.746 --> 02:57:05.781
IT PROPOSES PROPOSES TO DIVIDE

02:57:05.848 --> 02:57:08.517
FUNDING INTO SEPARATE SERVICES.

02:57:08.584 --> 02:57:10.286
INSTEAD OF ONE EIGHT OH FIVE WE

02:57:10.353 --> 02:57:11.520
WOULD NOW HAVE EARLY

02:57:11.587 --> 02:57:13.255
INTERVENTION TEACHERS A RATE FOR

02:57:13.322 --> 02:57:15.524
SUPERVISORS AND ONE FOR EACH

02:57:15.591 --> 02:57:17.660
TYPE OF SPECIALIST IN ADDITION

02:57:17.727 --> 02:57:19.362
IT WOULD BE FURTHER DIVIDED BY

02:57:19.428 --> 02:57:20.329
THE RATIO.

02:57:20.396 --> 02:57:23.032
OF ONE TO ONE ONE TWO TWO OR ONE

02:57:23.099 --> 02:57:24.300
TO THREE JUST AS AN EXAMPLE IN

02:57:24.367 --> 02:57:26.502
OUR EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM

02:57:26.569 --> 02:57:28.137
OUR TEAM INCLUDES.

OUR STAFF WORK AS A TEAM WE

02:57:47.890 --> 02:57:49.792
PROVIDE THE CURRICULUM WE

02:57:49.859 --> 02:57:51.961
ADDRESS ISSUES WITH FROM EACH

02:57:52.028 --> 02:57:53.696
DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE AS THEY

02:57:53.763 --> 02:57:54.663
OCCUR.

02:57:54.730 --> 02:57:56.399
ALL OF THE TEAM MEMBERS PLAN

02:57:56.465 --> 02:57:58.834
TRAIN WORK TOGETHER CREATED

02:57:58.901 --> 02:58:00.803

EACH CHILD AND FAMILY.

02:58:04.974 --> 02:58:06.909
IMAGINE THAT FOR EACH CHILD

02:58:06.976 --> 02:58:09.178
INSTEAD OF FUNDING A PROGRAM

02:58:09.245 --> 02:58:10.679
THERE WOULD BE SEPARATE PRE

02:58:10.746 --> 02:58:12.948
AUTHORIZATIONS AND BILLING FOR

02:58:13.015 --> 02:58:15.317
EACH OF THE DISCIPLINES INVOLVED.

02:58:15.384 --> 02:58:16.752
WHICH LEADS TO SEPARATE

02:58:16.819 --> 02:58:18.154
TREATMENT PLANS IN SEPARATE

02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:21.023
REPORTS THIS DOES NOT WORK ON A

02:58:21.090 --> 02:58:23.492
PRACTICAL ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL.

02:58:23.559 --> 02:58:25.094
IN IT TRULY UNDERMINES THE

02:58:25.161 --> 02:58:26.829
CONCEPT OF INTER DISCIPLINARY

02:58:26.896 --> 02:58:28.230
SERVICES.

02:58:28.297 --> 02:58:30.099
SO IN CONCLUSION WE ALL KNOW

02:58:30.166 --> 02:58:32.001
EARLY INTERVENTION CAN CHANGE

02:58:32.068 --> 02:58:33.803
LIVES I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND

02:58:33.869 --> 02:58:36.972
THAT EIGHT OH FIVE SERVICE

02:58:37.039 --> 02:58:38.274
REMAIN AS ONE UNIT.

02:58:38.340 --> 02:58:39.742
FULLY FUNDED.

02:58:39.809 --> 02:58:41.077
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

02:58:41.143 --> 02:58:43.245
KNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE GAINED OVER

02:58:43.312 --> 02:58:44.346
THIRTY YEARS.

02:58:44.413 --> 02:58:46.315
WE KNOW HOW TO PROVIDE QUALITY

02:58:46.382 --> 02:58:51.887
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVENTION IN IN --

02:58:51.954 --> 02:58:53.756
JUST INTERDISCIPLINARY SERVICES

MORE FOR YOUR REFERENCE I'M JUST

02:59:31.994 --> 02:59:33.028
GONNA HIT SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS --

02:59:33.095 --> 02:59:35.164
WE WERE ASKED BY A BULLS THE

02:59:35.231 --> 02:59:36.165
SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF AS

02:59:36.232 --> 02:59:38.200

HUMAN SERVICES -- TO REVIEW THE

02:59:41.270 --> 02:59:43.305
RATE STUDY AND PROVIDE SOME

02:59:43.372 --> 02:59:44.673
OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:59:44.740 --> 02:59:47.276
CONSIDER ABOUT WAYS TO BEGIN.

02:59:47.343 --> 02:59:50.446
IMPLEMENTING A RATE REFORM IN

02:59:50.513 --> 02:59:51.280
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY SO -- IN

02:59:51.347 --> 02:59:59.822
MY TALK I'M JUST GOING TO

02:59:59.889 --> 03:00:02.591
ADDRESS THEM.

03:00:02.658 --> 03:00:04.460
AS THE TWO OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE

03:00:04.527 --> 03:00:05.060
PROVIDED THEN TALK ABOUT SOME

03:00:05.127 --> 03:00:05.995
OTHER WAYS THAT YOU COULD

03:00:06.061 --> 03:00:07.129
PROVIDE PHYSICAL RELIEF -- IN

03:00:07.196 --> 03:00:08.264
THE COMING FISCAL YEAR IN

03:00:08.330 --> 03:00:09.798
COMBINATION WITH -- BEGINNING

03:00:09.865 --> 03:00:10.599
RATE REFORM AND THEN TALK ABOUT

03:00:10.666 --> 03:00:11.500
SOME OTHER HIGH LEVEL

03:00:11.567 --> 03:00:14.236
CONSIDERATIONS SO IF YOU TURN TO

03:00:14.303 --> 03:00:15.704
PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT.

03:00:15.771 --> 03:00:17.373
I THINK I'D I'D LIKE TO START BY

03:00:17.439 --> 03:00:18.841
FIRST EMPHASIZING THAT THREE

03:00:18.908 --> 03:00:20.743
STUDY REALLY PRESENTS A REAL

03:00:20.809 --> 03:00:23.312
OPPORTUNITY -- TO TAKE

03:00:23.379 --> 03:00:24.480
SUBSTANTIVE ACTION.

03:00:24.547 --> 03:00:27.750
IN -- TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AS

03:00:27.816 --> 03:00:28.951
HAS BEEN EVIDENCED BY THE

03:00:29.018 --> 03:00:31.620
PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AND AS WE ARE

03:00:31.687 --> 03:00:33.322
ALL AWARE THE SYSTEM IS IN NEED

03:00:33.389 --> 03:00:35.558
OF REFORM THE THE CURRENT RATE

03:00:35.624 --> 03:00:36.926
SETTING PROCESS IS SOMEWHAT.

03:00:36.992 --> 03:00:39.261
OF A CONVOLUTED AND THE RATE

03:00:39.328 --> 03:00:40.162
STUDY.

03:00:40.229 --> 03:00:42.398
THE RATE MODELS RATHER THAT ARE

03:00:42.464 --> 03:00:44.466
PROPOSED IN THE RATE STUDY THAT

03:00:44.533 --> 03:00:45.901
WAS CONDUCTED BY BURNS AND

03:00:45.968 --> 03:00:51.207
ASSOCIATES -- ARE BOTH A

03:00:51.273 --> 03:00:52.208
TRANSPARENT AND LOGICAL.

03:00:52.274 --> 03:00:53.609
THEY'RE ALSO RELATIVELY EASY TO

03:00:53.676 --> 03:00:57.346
UPDATE -- ON A REGULAR BASIS --

03:00:57.413 --> 03:00:58.013
YOU COULD ALSO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

03:00:58.080 --> 03:00:58.914
TO THEM BEFORE YOU EVEN BEGIN TO

03:00:58.981 --> 03:01:00.716
IMPLEMENT THEM -- YOU KNOW

03:01:00.783 --> 03:01:01.850
REFLECTING SOME OF THE CHANGES

03:01:01.917 --> 03:01:03.819
THAT THE PANELISTS TALKED TALKED

03:01:03.886 --> 03:01:06.288
ABOUT EARLIER -- AND THEY ALSO

03:01:06.355 --> 03:01:09.358
ARE PROVIDE MORE EQUITY ACROSS.

03:01:09.425 --> 03:01:12.661
A SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE

03:01:12.728 --> 03:01:17.866
SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS.

03:01:17.933 --> 03:01:22.771
WE WOULD -- ENCOURAGE THOSE THE

03:01:22.838 --> 03:01:23.539
LEGISLATURE TO DO AS MUCH AS

03:01:23.606 --> 03:01:25.507
POSSIBLE IN TWENTY NINETEEN

03:01:25.574 --> 03:01:27.376
TWENTY TO BEGIN RATE REFORM --

03:01:27.443 --> 03:01:29.378
THERE OBVIOUSLY SOME FISCAL AND

03:01:29.445 --> 03:01:31.247
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRAINTS THAT

03:01:31.313 --> 03:01:32.481
WOULD MAKE THIS DIFFICULT IF YOU

03:01:32.548 --> 03:01:33.849
WERE TO IMPLEMENT THE STUDY

03:01:33.916 --> 03:01:36.151
FULLY AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY

03:01:36.218 --> 03:01:37.319
IT WOULD BE ONE POINT.

03:01:37.386 --> 03:01:38.520
NINE BILLION DOLLARS OVER WITH

03:01:38.587 --> 03:01:41.223
THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN JANUARY

03:01:41.290 --> 03:01:41.824
ONE POINT TWO BILLION GENERAL

03:01:41.890 --> 03:01:44.226
FUND -- THERE ALSO A NUMBER OF

03:01:44.293 --> 03:01:45.160
IMPLEMENTATION AND

03:01:45.227 --> 03:01:46.795
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRAINTS THAT

03:01:46.862 --> 03:01:48.297
HAVE BEEN -- SORT OF TOUCHED

03:01:48.364 --> 03:01:50.599
UPON ALREADY NEVER THE LESS WE

03:01:50.666 --> 03:01:51.834
THINK THIS REPRESENTS AN

03:01:51.900 --> 03:01:53.736
OPPORTUNITY ON THERE'S A LOT OF

03:01:53.802 --> 03:01:55.638
SORT OF MOMENTUM FOR THIS RIGHT

03:01:55.704 --> 03:02:00.376
NOW -- AND THE SO TO THAT END

03:02:00.442 --> 03:02:02.344
I'M GOING TO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE

03:02:02.411 --> 03:02:03.979
THREE I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE

03:02:04.046 --> 03:02:06.582
FIRST OPTION -- THAT WE PROPOSE

03:02:06.649 --> 03:02:07.650
FOR CALLING THIS IS STAGED

03:02:07.716 --> 03:02:10.085
ROLLOUT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY LIKE

03:02:10.152 --> 03:02:12.221
PHASING IN RATE MODELS IN

03:02:12.288 --> 03:02:14.023
CERTAIN SERVICE CATEGORIES --

03:02:14.089 --> 03:02:14.957
BASED ON OUR LIMITED

03:02:15.024 --> 03:02:16.792
UNDERSTANDING SO FAR OF WHAT'S

03:02:16.859 --> 03:02:18.694
PROPOSED IN THE MAIN REVISION --

03:02:18.761 --> 03:02:19.795
THIS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THAN

03:02:19.862 --> 03:02:21.530
WHAT THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSING

03:02:21.597 --> 03:02:22.831
TO DO THERE I I BELIEVE

03:02:22.898 --> 03:02:24.800
PROPOSING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS

03:02:24.867 --> 03:02:27.836
BUT USING THE CURRENT STATUS QUO

03:02:27.903 --> 03:02:29.805
RATE SETTING STRUCTURE -- WHERE

03:02:29.872 --> 03:02:32.574
IS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS? TO

03:02:32.641 --> 03:02:34.510
ACTUALLY START ROLLING OUT THE

03:02:34.576 --> 03:02:36.845
PROPOSED RATE MODELS IN NINETEEN

03:02:36.912 --> 03:02:38.347
TWENTY AND IN SOME OF THE SELECT

03:02:38.414 --> 03:02:39.782
SERVICE CATEGORIES.

03:02:39.848 --> 03:02:43.752
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE -- FOUR

03:02:43.819 --> 03:02:46.455
WE PRESENT. FOR SERVICE

03:02:46.522 --> 03:02:48.590
CATEGORIES THAT -- BASED ON OUR

03:02:48.657 --> 03:02:51.360
REVIEW WE FOUND WOULD BE AMONG

03:02:51.427 --> 03:02:54.496
THOSE THAT WOULD -- THE MOST

03:02:54.563 --> 03:02:56.298
FEASIBLE TO IMPLEMENT IN THE

03:02:56.365 --> 03:02:59.335
COMING FISCAL YEAR -- THEY DON'T.

03:02:59.401 --> 03:03:01.470
REQUIRE A LOT OF CHANGES TO THE

03:03:01.537 --> 03:03:04.206
ACTUAL SERVICE PROVIDED PROVIDED

03:03:04.273 --> 03:03:05.140
OR THE WAY THAT THE SERVICES

03:03:05.207 --> 03:03:08.777
BUILD -- AND THEY ALSO ARE RATE

03:03:08.844 --> 03:03:12.715
MODELS THAT PROBABLY REQUIRE AS

03:03:12.781 --> 03:03:14.683
THE LEAST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

03:03:14.750 --> 03:03:16.018
INPUTS GOING INTO THE MODELS

03:03:16.085 --> 03:03:17.619
THERE MAY BE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO

03:03:17.686 --> 03:03:18.987
THAT SUCH AS INDEPENDENT LIVING

03:03:19.054 --> 03:03:21.056
SERVICES AS WE JUST DISCUSSED

03:03:21.123 --> 03:03:23.258
THERE MAY BE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

03:03:23.325 --> 03:03:23.859
THE WAGES OPTIONS THAT GO INTO

03:03:23.926 --> 03:03:25.894
THAT.

03:03:25.961 --> 03:03:28.831
I'M ON PAGE FIVE OURS THE SECOND

03:03:28.897 --> 03:03:31.600
OPTION THAT WE'RE SUGGESTING --

03:03:31.667 --> 03:03:33.035
COULD BE CONSIDERED IS

03:03:33.102 --> 03:03:35.371
CONDUCTING A STAGE ROLL OUT AS I

03:03:35.437 --> 03:03:37.873
JUST DESCRIBED BUT PACKAGING IT

03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:40.175
WITH PILOT PROJECTS IN SOME OF

03:03:40.242 --> 03:03:42.077
THE SERVICE CATEGORIES -- THAT

03:03:42.144 --> 03:03:43.345
ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE STAGE

03:03:43.412 --> 03:03:45.848
FOR ALL OUT TO TEST SOME OF

03:03:45.914 --> 03:03:48.350
THESE -- ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH

03:03:48.417 --> 03:03:52.821
IMPLEMENTATION -- SO IT TO THAT

03:03:52.888 --> 03:03:54.556
END WE WE SUGGESTS THAT IF THE

03:03:54.623 --> 03:03:56.725
LEGISLATURE WERE TO TO WANT TO

03:03:56.792 --> 03:03:58.093
MOVE FORWARD WITH A PILOT

03:03:58.160 --> 03:03:59.728
PROJECT APPROACH.

03:03:59.795 --> 03:04:01.430
THAT IT DO SO IN SORT OF A

03:04:01.497 --> 03:04:02.698
LIMITED NUMBER OF REGIONAL

03:04:02.765 --> 03:04:04.466
CENTERS MAYBE THREE TO REPRESENT

03:04:04.533 --> 03:04:06.201
THE DIFFERENT COST AREAS AND

03:04:06.268 --> 03:04:07.703
MAYBE WITH JUST A SMALL HANDFUL

03:04:07.770 --> 03:04:10.439
OF PROVIDERS IN -- EACH OF THE

03:04:10.506 --> 03:04:12.374
VARIOUS SERVICE CATEGORIES IN

03:04:12.441 --> 03:04:14.643
THE IDEA HERE REALLY WOULD BE TO

03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:15.944
TO TAKE SOME OFTHESE TRICKIER

03:04:16.011 --> 03:04:18.113
CATEGORIES LIKE DAY PROGRAMS

03:04:18.180 --> 03:04:19.515
INFANT DEVELOPMENT.

03:04:19.581 --> 03:04:21.617
AND SEE HOW THE RATE MODELS

03:04:21.683 --> 03:04:22.718
WOULD PLAY OUT IN THOSE

03:04:22.785 --> 03:04:24.353
CATEGORIES AND IT WOULD PROVIDE

03:04:24.420 --> 03:04:26.355
A LOT OF ABSURD BEST PRACTICES

03:04:26.422 --> 03:04:27.956
AND LESSONS LEARNED BEFORE

03:04:28.023 --> 03:04:31.627
ROLLING OUT THE THE RATE MODELS

03:04:31.693 --> 03:04:33.962
ON A STATEWIDE BASIS -- I SHOULD

03:04:34.029 --> 03:04:34.596
JUST MENTION TOO THAT WITH PILOT

03:04:34.663 --> 03:04:35.898
PROJECTS THE LEGISLATURE COULD

03:04:35.964 --> 03:04:37.166
REALLY DECIDE HOW MUCH IT WANTS

03:04:37.232 --> 03:04:38.600
TO SPEND IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE A

03:04:38.667 --> 03:04:39.668
HUGE AMOUNT.

03:04:39.735 --> 03:04:40.803
THE DEPARTMENT COULD DESIGN THE

03:04:40.869 --> 03:04:42.037
PILOT PROJECTS BASED ON THE

03:04:42.104 --> 03:04:43.439
AMOUNT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

03:04:43.505 --> 03:04:48.043
WANTS TO SPEND.

03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:50.312
IF YOU TURNED OUT TO PAGE SEVEN

03:04:50.379 --> 03:04:52.414
I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A LIST

03:04:52.481 --> 03:04:54.550
OF SOME OF THE OPTIONS THAT HAVE

03:04:54.616 --> 03:04:56.485
BEEN DISCUSSED EITHER -- BY

03:04:56.552 --> 03:04:58.854
MEMBERS ADVOCATES EVEN ALL OUR

03:04:58.921 --> 03:05:00.122
OFFICE.

03:05:00.189 --> 03:05:01.523
FOR LEASE THAT -- YOU COULD

03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:03.392
PROVIDE SOME FISCAL RELIEF UNDER

03:05:03.459 --> 03:05:05.227
THE STATUS QUO RATE SETTING

03:05:05.294 --> 03:05:06.328
FRAMEWORK.

03:05:06.395 --> 03:05:08.564
AS YOU DID MAYBE THE STAGE TO

03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:12.434
ROLL OUT -- OF OF RICK MODELS SO

03:05:12.501 --> 03:05:14.236
A COUPLE OF THESE HAVE TO DO

03:05:14.303 --> 03:05:17.039
WITH -- EITHER STATE STATE AND

03:05:17.105 --> 03:05:19.241
OR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ISSUES

03:05:19.308 --> 03:05:21.710
THREE OF THEM HAVE TO DO WITH

03:05:21.777 --> 03:05:23.212
RESTORING.

03:05:23.278 --> 03:05:24.613
OF FUNDING THAT WAS CUT DURING

03:05:24.680 --> 03:05:26.949
THE RECESSION AND THEN THE LAST

03:05:27.015 --> 03:05:29.117
ONE WOULD BE AN ACROSS THE BOARD

03:05:29.184 --> 03:05:30.552
RATE INCREASE AND THIS IS

03:05:30.619 --> 03:05:32.321
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED

03:05:32.387 --> 03:05:33.255
BY BOTH MEMBERS OF THE

03:05:33.322 --> 03:05:34.790
LEGISLATURE AS WELL.

03:05:34.857 --> 03:05:37.693
AS ADVOCATES -- THERE CERTAINLY

03:05:37.759 --> 03:05:39.228
SOME PROS AND CONS TO THIS

03:05:39.294 --> 03:05:41.029
APPROACH FOR EXAMPLE IT WOULD BE

03:05:41.096 --> 03:05:43.532
VERY ADMINISTRATIVELY SIMPLE TO

03:05:43.599 --> 03:05:45.267
ADMINISTER THE SAME TIME IT

03:05:45.334 --> 03:05:46.235
MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST COST

03:05:46.301 --> 03:05:47.936
EFFICIENT WAY TO YOU KNOW SOME

03:05:48.003 --> 03:05:49.571
PROVIDERS MIGHT NEED.

03:05:49.638 --> 03:05:51.373
RATE INCREASES MORE THAN OTHERS --

03:05:51.440 --> 03:05:55.344
ADDITIONALLY -- ONE CAUTIONARY

03:05:55.410 --> 03:05:58.447
NOTE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT --

03:05:58.514 --> 03:06:00.048
PROVIDERS WHO RECEIVE A RATE

03:06:00.115 --> 03:06:01.283
INCREASE HUNDRED ACROSS THE

03:06:01.350 --> 03:06:03.285
BOARD APPROACH COULD THEN BE IN

03:06:03.352 --> 03:06:04.786
A SITUATION WHERE THEY FACE A

03:06:04.853 --> 03:06:06.655
RATE REDUCTION ONCE THE RATE

03:06:06.722 --> 03:06:09.424
MODEL IS IMPLEMENTED IN THAT

03:06:09.491 --> 03:06:11.627
SERVICE CATEGORY IN THE FUTURE.

03:06:11.693 --> 03:06:14.863
PAGE EIGHT SPREAD JUST PROVIDES

03:06:14.930 --> 03:06:16.298
THE ESTIMATED TWENTY NINETEEN

03:06:16.365 --> 03:06:17.633
TWENTY COSTS FOR EACH OF THOSE

03:06:17.699 --> 03:06:19.134
OPTIONS AND THEN THE TABLE ON

03:06:19.201 --> 03:06:20.702
PAGE NINE PROVIDES THE GENERAL

03:06:20.769 --> 03:06:21.770
FUND COST.

03:06:21.837 --> 03:06:23.572
IF YOU WERE TO PACKAGE SOME OF

03:06:23.639 --> 03:06:25.340
THOSE OPTIONS WITH THE STAGE

03:06:25.407 --> 03:06:27.609
ROLL OUT OF THE RATE MODELS.

03:06:27.676 --> 03:06:29.244
AND THERE'S A LOT OF FIGURES

03:06:29.311 --> 03:06:30.679
THERE BUT REALLY THE TAKE AWAY

03:06:30.746 --> 03:06:32.281
IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A

03:06:32.347 --> 03:06:33.682
LOT OF DIFFERENT.

03:06:33.749 --> 03:06:35.684
OPTIONS AND APPROACHES THAT IT

03:06:35.751 --> 03:06:37.019
COULD TAKE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH

03:06:37.085 --> 03:06:38.120
IT WANTS.

03:06:38.186 --> 03:06:41.557
TO SPEND ON RATE REFORM IN THE

03:06:41.623 --> 03:06:42.591
IN THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR.

03:06:42.658 --> 03:06:44.359
I AM SO I WILL JUST CONCLUDE IF

03:06:44.426 --> 03:06:45.961
YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN WITH SOME

03:06:46.028 --> 03:06:48.964
HIGH LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS.

03:06:49.031 --> 03:06:49.598
WE DID MENTION AT THE BEGINNING

03:06:49.665 --> 03:06:51.333
OF BETTER I'VE MENTIONED AT THE

03:06:51.400 --> 03:06:52.834
BEGINNING OF THIS TALK THAT.

03:06:52.901 --> 03:06:54.436
THERE'S SOME REAL BENEFITS TO

03:06:54.503 --> 03:06:55.571
THE RATE MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:06:55.637 --> 03:06:58.106
PROPOSED BY BURNS AND ASSOCIATES.

03:06:58.173 --> 03:06:59.408
THEY'RE MAYBE ALSO SOME

03:06:59.474 --> 03:07:01.510
POTENTIAL TRADE OFFS AND JUST A

03:07:01.577 --> 03:07:03.712
COUPLE I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT --

03:07:03.779 --> 03:07:05.480
THE PROPOSED THREE MODELS DO NOT

03:07:05.547 --> 03:07:07.482
CURRENTLY -- CONSIDER LOCAL

03:07:07.549 --> 03:07:09.785
MINIMUM WAGES SPECIFICALLY MEAN

03:07:09.851 --> 03:07:10.552
THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD

03:07:10.619 --> 03:07:11.753
EASILY CHANGE THAT WHICH IS ONE

03:07:11.820 --> 03:07:12.721
OF THE BENEFITS OF THE RATE

03:07:12.788 --> 03:07:14.189
MODELS IS THAT THEY CAN BE

03:07:14.256 --> 03:07:15.757
UPDATED AND CHANGED THE THE

03:07:15.824 --> 03:07:18.627
INPUTS ARE DON'T HAVE TO BE

03:07:18.694 --> 03:07:20.228
STATIC.

03:07:20.295 --> 03:07:24.733
AND THEN -- AS OUR EARLIER

03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:25.500
PANELISTS MENTIONED THERE ARE

03:07:25.567 --> 03:07:26.201
RATE MODELS IN CERTAIN

03:07:26.268 --> 03:07:27.102
CATEGORIES THAT MAY LEAD TO

03:07:27.169 --> 03:07:28.003
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND ONE

03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:29.371
EXAMPLE IS IN THE EARLY START

03:07:29.438 --> 03:07:38.046
AREA -- THAT MIGHT BE ONE THAT

03:07:38.113 --> 03:07:40.616
NEEDS ADDITIONAL DELIBERATION --

03:07:40.682 --> 03:07:42.384
FINALLY I WOULD MENTION AS WE

03:07:42.451 --> 03:07:43.652
STATED LAST WEEK AT THE HEARING --

03:07:43.719 --> 03:07:44.319
WE THINK IT'LL BE REALLY

03:07:44.386 --> 03:07:44.987
IMPORTANT FOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT

03:07:45.053 --> 03:07:45.754

03:07:53.829 --> 03:07:55.797
TWENTY TWO AND HOW THE INTEND TO

ALL RIGHT.

03:12:33.475 --> 03:12:34.376
I THINK WE LET LAUGHTER GO BY

03:12:34.442 --> 03:12:36.878
THERE IS.

03:12:36.945 --> 03:12:38.313
THE CONTINUE ON I I DON'T ME BE

OVER PASSIONATE.

03:12:39.347 --> 03:12:39.881
BUT TO ME THIS IS ONE OF THE

03:12:39.948 --> 03:12:42.284
MOST IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT --

03:12:42.350 --> 03:12:43.785
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET.

03:12:43.852 --> 03:12:46.354
ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING BECAUSE

03:12:46.421 --> 03:12:47.822
WE'RE SETTING THE STAGE FOR HOW

03:12:47.889 --> 03:12:49.157
WE'RE GOING TO TREAT THIS FORMAL

03:12:49.224 --> 03:12:51.459
POPULATION IN THE FUTURE.

03:12:51.526 --> 03:12:52.827
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN SAY

03:12:52.894 --> 03:12:53.762
THAT THIS CAN'T BE A HIGHER

03:12:53.828 --> 03:12:55.397
PRIORITY WITH TWENTY TWO BILLION

03:12:55.463 --> 03:12:56.331
DOLLARS.

03:12:56.398 --> 03:12:57.966
IN ANTICIPATED REVENUE COMING

03:13:01.202 --> 03:13:03.471
GOING TO REALLY DEFINE -- THE

03:13:03.538 --> 03:13:07.509
GOVERNOR'S -- CARE.

03:13:07.575 --> 03:13:11.680
AND CONCERN. FOR PEOPLE THAT.

03:13:11.746 --> 03:13:14.049
DIDN'T GET A FAIR SHOT A LIFE

03:13:14.115 --> 03:13:15.650
UNFORTUNATELY WITH SOME

03:13:15.717 --> 03:13:19.354
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTAL --

03:13:19.421 --> 03:13:20.689
ILLNESSES THAT THEY HAVE TWO

03:13:20.755 --> 03:13:22.290

03:13:32.567 --> 03:13:35.337
ACTION.

03:13:35.403 --> 03:13:37.272
AND THE WAY WE DO ACTION AS WE

03:13:37.339 --> 03:13:39.107
START RESTORING THESE RATES WE

03:13:39.174 --> 03:13:40.208
SHOULD HAVE A THREE YEAR PHASE

03:13:40.275 --> 03:13:41.376
IN WHERE WE GET TO THAT ONE

03:13:41.443 --> 03:13:42.644
POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE

03:13:42.711 --> 03:13:44.479
GENERAL FUND -- AND WE NEED TO

IS A LOW COST PLACE TO LIVE AND

03:14:30.225 --> 03:14:31.659

LIKE HOW.

03:16:09.824 --> 03:16:11.693
THE RESOURCES WE ARE DEDICATING

03:16:11.759 --> 03:16:12.760
OF WE DO ADD MORE RESOURCES TO

03:16:12.827 --> 03:16:14.762
THE BILL THAT ON THIS RATE STUDY

03:16:14.829 --> 03:16:16.431
IS THE SORT OF THE FACE

IN LOOKING AT THE FISCAL

03:17:05.747 --> 03:17:07.215
PROJECTIONS.

03:17:07.282 --> 03:17:09.284
OF THE KIND OF METHODOLOGY AN

03:17:09.350 --> 03:17:11.920
ALLOCATION HOWEVER LOOKING AT

03:17:11.986 --> 03:17:14.322

PROJECTED ALLOCATION SO THE I'LL

03:17:23.965 --> 03:17:25.767
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WHEN WE TAKE

03:17:25.833 --> 03:17:29.637
A LOOK AT THEY SUPPORTED LIVING

03:17:29.704 --> 03:17:31.673
SERVICES AND KNOWINGTHAT

03:17:31.739 --> 03:17:35.176
THERE'S WITHIN THE RATE STUDY

03:17:35.243 --> 03:17:36.811
THAT IF.

03:17:36.878 --> 03:17:39.414
OF PARTICULARS REGIONAL CENTER --

03:17:39.480 --> 03:17:41.049
WOULD HAVE BEEN PROJECTED AT A

03:17:41.115 --> 03:17:44.185
CERTAIN RATE -- ADJUSTMENT AS

03:17:44.252 --> 03:17:45.820
COMPARED TO ANOTHER ONE KIND OF

03:17:45.887 --> 03:17:48.156
FACTORY AND FACTORING IN THOSE

03:17:48.223 --> 03:17:50.525
DIFFERENCES -- IF YOU WELL KINDA

03:17:50.592 --> 03:17:53.494
WAITING IT -- WOULD KINDA HELP

03:17:53.561 --> 03:17:55.263
MOVE THE NEEDLE TOWARDS

03:17:55.330 --> 03:17:58.032
ADDRESSING SOME OF THE IN

03:17:58.099 --> 03:18:00.001
EQUITIES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT

03:18:00.068 --> 03:18:01.603
REGIONAL CENTERS.

03:18:01.669 --> 03:18:03.404
AS A THAT ASSUMPTION WAS BUILT

03:18:03.471 --> 03:18:05.940
IN INTO TRAIN TO TAKE A LOOK AT

03:18:06.007 --> 03:18:08.376
ON AN AVERAGE --THE FISCAL

03:18:08.443 --> 03:18:12.747
PROJECTION WOULD BE AT ABOUT 18% --

03:18:12.814 --> 03:18:15.416
ADJUSTMENT OVER EXISTING RATES

03:18:15.483 --> 03:18:18.019
THAT SAID THAT WOULD BE VARIABLE

03:18:18.086 --> 03:18:20.788
BASED ON THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL

03:18:20.855 --> 03:18:22.490
CENTERS DIFFERENT PROVIDERS --

03:18:22.557 --> 03:18:25.026
CONSIDERING SOME OF THOSE --

03:18:25.093 --> 03:18:28.630
ELEMENTS THAT DO YOU.

03:18:28.696 --> 03:18:31.499
IMPACT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN.

03:18:31.566 --> 03:18:33.034
PROVIDER RATE I'M SORRY FOR IT

03:18:33.101 --> 03:18:35.003
IT'S SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED BUT IT

03:18:35.069 --> 03:18:36.537
IS IT'S TAKING ELEMENTS THAT

03:18:36.604 --> 03:18:38.673
INFORMED US TO BE ABLE TO APPLY

03:18:38.740 --> 03:18:39.874
SO IT WOULDN'T JUST BE

03:18:39.941 --> 03:18:41.209
PERPETUATING.

03:18:41.276 --> 03:18:42.644
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:45.313
DON'T WANT TO PERPETUATE BUT NOT

03:18:45.380 --> 03:18:47.081
FULLY IMPLEMENTING A MODEL.

03:18:47.148 --> 03:18:48.950
OKAY SO SERVE SOMETHING IN

03:18:49.017 --> 03:18:49.584
BETWEEN.

03:18:49.651 --> 03:18:51.619
THE HYBRID HYBRID IT'S IT'S IT'S

03:18:51.686 --> 03:18:53.087
TAKING ELEMENTS THAT'S

03:18:53.154 --> 03:18:55.423
INFORMATIVE TO US -- BUT NOT

03:18:55.490 --> 03:18:56.557
IMPLEMENTING THE MODEL THAT WE

03:18:56.624 --> 03:19:00.528
WE WANT TO USE THE INFORMATION --

03:19:00.595 --> 03:19:01.663
TO CONSIDERATE AT ADDRESSING --

03:19:01.729 --> 03:19:04.132
PRIORITIES OKAY SO BECAUSE I

03:19:04.198 --> 03:19:06.601
THINK IT ALSO IN TERMS OF

03:19:06.668 --> 03:19:07.902
SENDING.

03:19:07.969 --> 03:19:08.603
I GUESS I'LL CALL SIGNAL OR

03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:09.337
SITTING WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS

03:19:09.404 --> 03:19:10.605
ARE.

03:19:10.672 --> 03:19:12.940
AT WHAT POINT AGAIN RECOGNIZING

03:19:13.007 --> 03:19:13.975
THEIR STILL NEEDS TO BE A LOT

03:19:14.042 --> 03:19:15.476
MORE STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND

03:19:15.543 --> 03:19:17.078
THERE'S SOME ADJUSTMENTS AND AND

03:19:17.145 --> 03:19:17.979
I HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT

03:19:18.046 --> 03:19:20.415
SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS AND SO

03:19:20.481 --> 03:19:21.716
FORTH THE AT WHAT POINT.

03:19:21.783 --> 03:19:23.785
DO YOU ANTICIPATE SWITCHING OVER

03:19:23.851 --> 03:19:24.919
TO SAYING THAT AND AGAIN I

03:19:24.986 --> 03:19:26.721
REALIZE YOU MAY YOU KNOW YOU MAY

03:19:26.788 --> 03:19:27.955
TWO THINGS IT'S AT RIGHT NOT

03:19:28.022 --> 03:19:28.690
ONLY WITH THE RATES A SELF BUT

03:19:28.756 --> 03:19:30.425
WITH EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO BUT

03:19:30.491 --> 03:19:30.992
WHEN YOU SAY THIS IS IN THE

03:19:31.059 --> 03:19:31.893
MIDDLE.

03:19:31.959 --> 03:19:33.194
AT SOME POINT DO YOU TELL PEOPLE

03:19:33.261 --> 03:19:35.063
LIKE ACTUALLY THE BASE

03:19:35.129 --> 03:19:38.032
ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE BASIS IS

03:19:38.099 --> 03:19:38.966
GOING TO BE.

03:19:39.033 --> 03:19:40.101
RELATED TO THE METHODOLOGY

03:19:40.168 --> 03:19:42.170
DEVELOPED FOR I DON'T TOLERATE

03:19:42.236 --> 03:19:43.237
STUDY ANYMORE AT ALL THIS

03:19:43.304 --> 03:19:44.172
BECAUSE IT WOULD PASS THE STUDY

03:19:44.238 --> 03:19:46.007
PHASE RIGHT WE ACTUALLY THIS IS

03:19:46.074 --> 03:19:47.141
NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WAR WE

03:19:47.208 --> 03:19:48.776
CAN IMPLEMENT IT OR NOT -- SO

03:19:48.843 --> 03:19:50.545
THE RATE PROPOSAL ORDER RATE

03:19:50.611 --> 03:19:53.081
STRUCTURE -- BECAUSE NO LONGER

03:19:53.147 --> 03:19:55.249
JUST THE STUDY SO WHAT POINT DO

03:19:55.316 --> 03:19:57.518
WE SAY IS INTENTION TO SAY WELL

03:19:57.585 --> 03:19:58.686
OKAY FOR NOW THIS IS THE

03:19:58.753 --> 03:20:01.422
FOUNDATION ON WHICH WE BUILD.

03:20:01.489 --> 03:20:03.291
WHETHER IT'S INCREASES ARE AT

03:20:03.358 --> 03:20:05.526
CENTER -- AND DISS THE

03:20:05.593 --> 03:20:06.794
METHODOLOGY WHICH WE'RE NOW

03:20:06.861 --> 03:20:08.329
BRACING IS BEING THE WAY WE'RE

03:20:08.396 --> 03:20:11.933
GOING TO HANDLE PAYMENTS GOING

03:20:11.999 --> 03:20:13.201
FORWARD.

03:20:13.267 --> 03:20:14.669
SO AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER THAT --

03:20:14.736 --> 03:20:16.871
AN IMPORTANT PART OF LOOKING AT

03:20:16.938 --> 03:20:19.006
THIS NEXT STEP IS THE DISCUSSION

03:20:19.073 --> 03:20:20.675
THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS SUMMER.

03:20:20.742 --> 03:20:21.776
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

03:20:21.843 --> 03:20:25.546
LOOKING BROAD AS FAR AS THE NOT

03:20:25.613 --> 03:20:27.548
ONLY THE RATE STUDY BUT THE

03:20:27.615 --> 03:20:30.118
SYSTEM AND EVERY KIND OF EVERY

03:20:30.184 --> 03:20:31.486
ELEMENT INTO IT.

03:20:31.552 --> 03:20:34.055
SO SO AS FAR AS THOSE NEXT STEPS

03:20:34.122 --> 03:20:35.990
THE IMPORTANT PART OF THAT IS

03:20:36.057 --> 03:20:37.358
DEFINITELY HAVING THAT VERY

03:20:37.425 --> 03:20:38.760
TARGETED DISCUSSION OVER THE

03:20:38.826 --> 03:20:40.661
SUMMER ON THE THINGS THAT ARE

03:20:40.728 --> 03:20:42.964
REALLY INFLUENCING THIS AND AND

03:20:43.030 --> 03:20:44.832
EVERYTHING THAT YOU HEARD TODAY.

03:20:44.899 --> 03:20:46.000
NO NO IT HAS TO BE PART OF IT

03:20:46.067 --> 03:20:47.335
YOU DID I HEAR DISCUSSION

03:20:47.402 --> 03:20:48.369
OBVIOUSLY DISCUSSIONS VERY

03:20:48.436 --> 03:20:49.904
IMPORTANT AND THEN CHANGES WILL

03:20:49.971 --> 03:20:51.205
BE MADE BASED ON THE DISCUSSIONS

03:20:51.272 --> 03:20:53.040
BUT AS THE GOAL LIKE BY NEXT

03:20:53.107 --> 03:20:54.742
YEAR FOR PHILLY OBVIOUSLY

03:20:54.809 --> 03:20:56.144
THERE'S GONNA BE ADJUSTMENTS OR

03:20:56.210 --> 03:20:57.512
CHANGES MADE BASED ON THE

03:20:57.578 --> 03:21:00.014
FEEDBACK. TO TRY TO MOVE TOWARD

03:21:00.081 --> 03:21:01.716
A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE SAYING

03:21:01.783 --> 03:21:03.351
THAT THIS IS GONNA NOW BECAUSE

03:21:03.418 --> 03:21:04.786
THE BASE AND I REALIZE THERE

03:21:04.852 --> 03:21:06.053
MIGHT BE THINGS YOU DO CUTS

03:21:06.120 --> 03:21:07.321
CLEANERS AND SO FORTH AS YOUR

03:21:07.388 --> 03:21:08.890
TRAIN TRANSITION OVER BUT THAT

03:21:08.956 --> 03:21:09.991
FUNDAMENTALLY WE MADE THE

03:21:10.057 --> 03:21:15.596
DECISION THIS IS THE NEW MODEL.

03:21:15.663 --> 03:21:17.765
SO TO DISCUSSIONS YOU KNOW WE WE

03:21:17.832 --> 03:21:18.399
APPRECIATE THAT THAT THAT WE'RE

03:21:18.466 --> 03:21:19.066
NOT WANTING TO HAVE A DISCUSSION

03:21:19.133 --> 03:21:19.734
FOR THE PURPOSE OF HAVING

03:21:19.801 --> 03:21:21.068
ANOTHER DISCUSSION RIGHT YOU

03:21:21.135 --> 03:21:22.637
KNOW BUT WHAT IS THE PATH WHAT

03:21:22.703 --> 03:21:24.005
IS THAT PATH FORWARD.

03:21:24.071 --> 03:21:25.273
YOU KNOW AND AND AND THAT'S

03:21:25.339 --> 03:21:27.241
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE --

03:21:27.308 --> 03:21:28.810
TO OBTAIN CLARITY YOU KNOW TO BE

03:21:28.876 --> 03:21:31.145
ABLE TO GOAL BY NEXT YEAR TO

03:21:31.212 --> 03:21:32.747
SERVE AT LEAST I MEAN YOU HAVE A

03:21:32.814 --> 03:21:34.682
STUDY RIGHT YEAH I CONSULT NEED

03:21:34.749 --> 03:21:35.850
TO STUDY YOU'RE GETTING YOUR

03:21:35.917 --> 03:21:36.751
CALL BACK FROM PEOPLE.

03:21:36.818 --> 03:21:37.552
CORRECT THE GOAL WOULD

03:21:37.618 --> 03:21:39.187
DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO HAVE A

03:21:39.253 --> 03:21:41.155
CLEAR PATH AS TO WHAT THOSE NEXT

03:21:41.222 --> 03:21:43.057
STEPS ARE TO WHAT THOSE.

03:21:43.124 --> 03:21:44.525
THOSE ARE.

03:21:44.592 --> 03:21:45.393
WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT

03:21:45.460 --> 03:21:46.928
CONVERSATION OKAY WELL I I GUESS

03:21:46.994 --> 03:21:50.932
IS THERE GOING TO BE AND YOU

03:21:50.998 --> 03:21:51.866
PAYMENT METHODOLOGY ESSENTIALLY.

03:21:51.933 --> 03:21:53.201
BASED ON THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE

03:21:53.267 --> 03:21:54.769
HAVE WE WILL HAVE AN WILL BE

03:21:54.836 --> 03:21:55.970
ABLE TO HAVE MORE CLARITY AS TO

03:21:56.037 --> 03:21:57.305
WHAT.

03:21:57.371 --> 03:21:58.940
APPROACH OR METHODOLOGIES WILL

03:21:59.006 --> 03:22:00.508
BE DOING THAT TODAY WE DON'T

03:22:00.575 --> 03:22:01.876
HAVE THAT ANSWER BECAUSE WE DO

03:22:01.943 --> 03:22:02.944
NEED TO HAVE THAT BROADER

03:22:03.010 --> 03:22:05.279
DISCUSSION -- AND WE'RE PREPARED

03:22:05.346 --> 03:22:06.047
TO DO THAT OVER THE SUMMER

03:22:06.113 --> 03:22:07.849
APPRECIATE.

03:22:07.915 --> 03:22:10.351
KEEPING A SURPRISE TO THE A THE

03:22:10.418 --> 03:22:11.319
I I THINK.

03:22:11.385 --> 03:22:15.957
BY THE AT SOME POINT -- WE'RE

03:22:16.023 --> 03:22:17.492
GONNA HAVE TO THE EIGHTH AT SOME

03:22:17.558 --> 03:22:18.526
POINT.

03:22:18.593 --> 03:22:19.827
WE'RE GONNA TO MAKE A DECISION

03:22:19.894 --> 03:22:21.429
ARE YOU GONNA STICK TO THE OLD

03:22:21.496 --> 03:22:22.363
WAY ARE WE MOVING TO THIS NEW

03:22:22.430 --> 03:22:23.798
WAY RIGHT I WAS WE MADE THIS

03:22:23.865 --> 03:22:25.266
INVESTMENT THE LEGISLATURE

03:22:25.333 --> 03:22:27.401
SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE MADE DALY

03:22:27.468 --> 03:22:28.703
THAT.

03:22:28.769 --> 03:22:29.937
YOU DID THE STUDY ETCETERA AND

03:22:30.004 --> 03:22:30.505
EVERYONE'S GONNA GIVE THEIR

03:22:30.571 --> 03:22:32.273
FEEDBACK AND QUESTIONS YOU SAY

03:22:32.340 --> 03:22:33.341
WELL ACTUALLY.

03:22:33.407 --> 03:22:34.275
THIS IS THE WAY WE'RE PLAYING TO

03:22:34.342 --> 03:22:35.977
DO THINGS WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE

03:22:36.043 --> 03:22:37.211
SOME CORRECTIONS RIGHT SOME

03:22:37.278 --> 03:22:38.246
ASSUMPTIONS ARE RIGHT WE'RE

03:22:38.312 --> 03:22:40.481
GONNA KILL MAYBE NOT LIBERTIES

03:22:40.548 --> 03:22:41.916
MANY TOES AT YOU BECAUSE

03:22:41.983 --> 03:22:43.651
WHATEVER ELSE THOSE ARE KIND OF

03:22:43.718 --> 03:22:44.652
LIKE THE FAINT BUT BUT

03:22:44.719 --> 03:22:45.520
FUNDAMENTALLY WE GOING THIS

03:22:45.586 --> 03:22:48.022
DIRECTION OR WE LIKE.

03:22:48.089 --> 03:22:49.991
WELL.

03:22:50.057 --> 03:22:51.025
WE PULLED EXCEL SOME POINT WE

03:22:51.092 --> 03:22:51.659
GOT TO HAVE SOME CLARITY

03:22:51.726 --> 03:22:52.493
ANYTHING PEOPLE NEED SOME

03:22:52.560 --> 03:22:53.427
CLARITY WHETHER YOUNG PEOPLE

03:22:53.494 --> 03:22:54.996
HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT WE

03:22:55.062 --> 03:22:55.997
SHOULD DO BUT SOMEBODY AT THE

03:22:56.063 --> 03:22:56.831
SAVE WELL WE'RE GONNA MAKE A

03:22:56.898 --> 03:22:58.132
DECISION WHICH WAY WE'RE GOING

03:22:58.199 --> 03:22:59.267
TO SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO

03:22:59.333 --> 03:23:00.001
PLAN MOVING FORWARD.

03:23:00.067 --> 03:23:02.236
AND ALSO SAME HERE TO IN TERMS

03:23:02.303 --> 03:23:03.538
OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO.

03:23:03.604 --> 03:23:06.807
OUR OUR PAYMENTS I THINK THAT'S

03:23:06.874 --> 03:23:08.376
WHAT I'M HEARING FROM LA AS WELL.

03:23:08.442 --> 03:23:09.644
YES AND I I WOULD JUST ADD ON TO

03:23:09.710 --> 03:23:11.178
THAT POINT THAT I THINK IT'S

03:23:11.245 --> 03:23:12.680
IT'S GOING TO BE CHALLENGING I

03:23:12.747 --> 03:23:13.648
MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO BE GROWING

03:23:13.714 --> 03:23:15.816
PAINS ASSOCIATED WITH MOVING TO

03:23:15.883 --> 03:23:17.285
A NEW RATE SETTING METHODOLOGY

03:23:17.351 --> 03:23:19.220
AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE VERY

03:23:19.287 --> 03:23:20.855
DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE.

03:23:20.922 --> 03:23:23.824
EVERY SINGLE POLICY REGULATORY

03:23:23.891 --> 03:23:25.893
GUIDANCE LIKE EVERY CHANGE THAT

03:23:25.960 --> 03:23:28.396
MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE AHEAD OF

03:23:28.462 --> 03:23:29.564
TIME AND AT SOME POINT.

03:23:29.630 --> 03:23:31.465
YOU HAVE TO JUMP IN AND SEE HOW

03:23:31.532 --> 03:23:33.467
IT PLAYS OUT AND MAYBE MAKE SOME

03:23:33.534 --> 03:23:34.835
ADJUSTMENTS ALONG THE WAY I MEAN

03:23:34.902 --> 03:23:36.337
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO PUT

03:23:36.404 --> 03:23:37.104
ANYONE AT RISK.

03:23:37.171 --> 03:23:38.372
GOING TO GET INTO LEGAL

03:23:38.439 --> 03:23:40.107
CHALLENGES OR OR THAT SORT OF

03:23:40.174 --> 03:23:42.977
THING BUT YOU COULD CONTINUE TO

03:23:43.044 --> 03:23:45.279
STUDY THIS PROBABLY INSTEAD

03:23:45.346 --> 03:23:46.380
NEVER.

03:23:46.447 --> 03:23:49.450
REACH THE PERFECT SOLUTION SO --

03:23:49.517 --> 03:23:50.484
WELL I MEAN I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

03:23:50.551 --> 03:23:51.285
SAYING AND ANY IS IS BECAUSE

03:23:51.352 --> 03:23:53.187
OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL BE STILL

03:23:53.254 --> 03:23:54.255
INVOLVING IT'S OUR AND

03:23:54.322 --> 03:23:55.590
ADJUSTMENTS AND THINGS WILL

03:23:55.656 --> 03:23:57.325
CHANGE IN ENVIRONMENT TO SELL.

03:23:57.391 --> 03:23:58.693
BUT SORT OF I THINK THIS SOUNDS

03:23:58.759 --> 03:23:59.627
TO ME LIKE YOU FROM YOUR

03:23:59.694 --> 03:24:01.862
PRESENTATION FROM READING THINGS

03:24:01.929 --> 03:24:02.530
THAT.

03:24:02.597 --> 03:24:03.798
THERE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT

03:24:03.864 --> 03:24:05.299
WAYS OF DOING THINGS THE WAY

03:24:05.366 --> 03:24:06.734
WE'RE DOING NOW WHICH THERE'S

03:24:06.801 --> 03:24:08.202
NOT A LOT TRANSPARENCY AND

03:24:08.269 --> 03:24:09.637
THERE'S A LOT OF VARIABILITY AND

03:24:09.704 --> 03:24:12.206
NOT ALL OF ITS HISTORY JUSTIFIED.

03:24:12.273 --> 03:24:13.074
AND THEN WE'RE TRYING TO COME

03:24:13.140 --> 03:24:14.175
WITH A MORE SYSTEMATIC WAY OF

03:24:14.241 --> 03:24:15.943
DOING THINGS.

03:24:16.010 --> 03:24:16.510
THERE ARE SOME WINNERS AND

03:24:16.577 --> 03:24:19.046
LOSERS THERE SO PEOPLE MAY NOT

03:24:19.113 --> 03:24:20.915
BE SO HAPPY WITH THAT EITHER BUT

03:24:20.982 --> 03:24:22.316
JUST.

03:24:22.383 --> 03:24:24.452
TELL AND AND NOT SAYING THAT.

03:24:24.518 --> 03:24:25.252
WE HAVE A PERFECT SYSTEM EITHER

03:24:25.319 --> 03:24:27.188
THE EACH ONE COULD OF ALL THE

03:24:27.254 --> 03:24:28.789
DIFFERENT WAYS TO SELL ITEMS

03:24:28.856 --> 03:24:30.791
THAT I HOPE THAT -- THERE THAT

03:24:30.858 --> 03:24:34.795
WE CAN MAKE SOME PROGRESS IN

03:24:34.862 --> 03:24:36.831
FIGURING THAT OUT THOUGH.

03:24:36.897 --> 03:24:39.233
TELL OKAY -- AND THEN I CAN DO

03:24:39.300 --> 03:24:40.401
SO SOME OF THE MORE SPECIFIC.

03:24:40.468 --> 03:24:41.402
QUESTIONS ABOUT SO WE HEARD FROM

03:24:41.469 --> 03:24:41.936
SOME OF THE PRESENTERS FOR

03:24:42.003 --> 03:24:44.505
EXAMPLE -- LIKE ON THE LABOR

03:24:44.572 --> 03:24:45.773
SIDE RATE WE HAVE.

03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:48.242
CERTAIN LABOR RULES IN PLACE --

03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:50.177
THERE TO PROTECT WORKERS AND SO

03:24:50.244 --> 03:24:51.512
FORTH -- SO CLEARLY WE'VE TALKED

03:24:51.579 --> 03:24:53.080
ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE BUT THINGS

03:24:53.147 --> 03:24:54.949
LIKE BREAKS AND SO FORTH THAT

03:24:55.016 --> 03:24:56.217
AND THE LEASE IT WAS REPORTED

03:24:56.283 --> 03:24:57.118
THAT THEY FELT LIKE THAT THAT

03:24:57.184 --> 03:24:59.820
WASN'T REALLY INCORPORATED INTO

03:24:59.887 --> 03:25:01.322
THE METHODOLOGY IS.

03:25:01.389 --> 03:25:03.024
LIKE MAYBE CAN PERHAPS THAT YOUR

03:25:03.090 --> 03:25:07.395
TECHNICAL EXPERT CAN SPEAK -- TO

03:25:07.461 --> 03:25:09.664
TO TO TO THAT ISSUE -- THAT WAS

03:25:09.730 --> 03:25:10.831
REYES SO IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW

03:25:10.898 --> 03:25:13.634
USING THE BLS VERSES O OTHER

03:25:13.701 --> 03:25:14.435
TYPES OF WAYS OF LOOKING AT

03:25:14.502 --> 03:25:14.802
THINGS OF YOU.

03:25:14.869 --> 03:25:17.772
OF OF COURSE SENATOR PAN AND AND

03:25:17.838 --> 03:25:19.573
ALL HAVE -- OUR CONSULTING GO

03:25:19.640 --> 03:25:21.175
AHEAD AND AND RESPOND TO YOUR

03:25:21.242 --> 03:25:22.710
QUESTION REGARDING SOME OF THE

03:25:22.777 --> 03:25:23.911
THINGS THAT WERE INCLUDED THE

03:25:23.978 --> 03:25:25.780
KIND OF TECHNICAL PIECES OF IT --

03:25:25.846 --> 03:25:28.315
BUT I DO WANT TO ALSO JUST --

03:25:28.382 --> 03:25:31.018
SHARE WHICH I THINK IT GOES

03:25:31.085 --> 03:25:32.420
WITHOUT SAYING BUT I DO WANT TO

ALSO GIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE

03:25:34.622 --> 03:25:37.124
IMPORTANCE OF KIND OF THAT INPUT.

WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE SOME

03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:44.198
OF THOSE COMMENTS.

COMMENTS THAT -- THAT THE

03:25:47.068 --> 03:25:48.903
COMMUNITY HAS SHARED ONE OF THE

03:25:48.969 --> 03:25:50.337
THINGS I THINK HAS BEEN A VALUE

IN LOOKING AT KINDA ELEMENTS OF

03:25:52.673 --> 03:25:54.108
KIND OF THE OF TOTAL.

03:25:54.175 --> 03:25:55.910
KIND OF PICTURE OF THE THE RATE

03:25:55.976 --> 03:25:58.212
MODELS IS THAT THERE IS.

03:25:58.279 --> 03:26:01.716
ELEMENTS OF IT THAT TALKS TO A

WAS IMPORTANT IN SOME OF THE

03:26:07.221 --> 03:26:09.557
FEEDBACK THAT WE ALSO RECEIVE SO

03:26:09.623 --> 03:26:10.257
I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT

03:26:10.324 --> 03:26:12.193
ISN'T AS SO JUST POINT OUT YOUR

03:26:12.259 --> 03:26:13.127
ANSWERS COOLEY WE'RE NOT WE

03:26:13.194 --> 03:26:15.029
DON'T EITHER HAVE THE TIME AND I

03:26:15.096 --> 03:26:15.963
HAVEN'T HAD DEAL TO GO THROUGH

03:26:16.030 --> 03:26:17.331
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GO THROUGH

03:26:17.398 --> 03:26:17.832
EACH LITTLE.

03:26:17.898 --> 03:26:19.633
DETAIL THE SERVER ON A HIGHER

03:26:19.700 --> 03:26:20.701
LEVEL.

03:26:20.768 --> 03:26:22.770
LIKE HOW -- HOW DID YOU APPROACH

03:26:22.837 --> 03:26:24.238
AND GET INFORMATION ABOUT FOR

03:26:24.305 --> 03:26:25.639
EXAMPLE BE SURELY MORE ACT

03:26:25.706 --> 03:26:28.342
ACTUALLY REFLECT THE LABOR COSTS

03:26:28.409 --> 03:26:30.277
HERE IN CALIFORNIA GIVE?

03:26:30.344 --> 03:26:34.815
OUR YOU KNOW OUR LAWS AND RULES

03:26:34.882 --> 03:26:37.518
ABOUT THAT HERE.

03:26:37.585 --> 03:26:39.353
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF

03:26:39.420 --> 03:26:40.087
I'LL TRY TO BE.

03:26:40.154 --> 03:26:41.122
BRIEF MY ANSWER FOR WHAT WAS A

03:26:41.188 --> 03:26:42.123
RELATIVELY COMPLICATED PORTION

03:26:42.189 --> 03:26:43.390
OF THE ANALYSIS.

03:26:43.457 --> 03:26:44.625
SO AS SOME OF THE PANELISTS

03:26:44.692 --> 03:26:46.927
ALLUDED TO WE RELYON FIRST AND

03:26:46.994 --> 03:26:47.762
FOREMOST ON DATA FROM

03:26:47.828 --> 03:26:49.363
INDEPENDENT DATA SOURCES FOR OUR

03:26:49.430 --> 03:26:51.098
WAGES OPTION SO PEOPLE MADE

03:26:51.165 --> 03:26:52.833
REFERENCE TO THE BLS FOR THE

03:26:52.900 --> 03:26:54.268
BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.

03:26:54.335 --> 03:26:55.569
WHICH IS AN OFFICE WITHIN THE

03:26:55.636 --> 03:26:57.104
FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF LABOR THEY

03:26:57.171 --> 03:26:58.139
DO A EMPLOYER SURVEY.

03:26:58.205 --> 03:27:00.040
TO GATHER INFORMATION ON CURRENT

03:27:00.107 --> 03:27:00.841
WAGE LEVELS.

03:27:00.908 --> 03:27:02.810
AS FOLKS INDICATED WE USED A

03:27:02.877 --> 03:27:03.978
WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF A NUMBER OF

03:27:04.044 --> 03:27:05.279
DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONS TO SET THE

03:27:05.346 --> 03:27:07.081
WAITRESS OPTIONS FOR MOST THOUGH

03:27:07.148 --> 03:27:08.783
NOT ALL THE RATE MODELS.

03:27:08.849 --> 03:27:10.117
AND WE'RE TALKING -- DSPS WHICH

03:27:10.184 --> 03:27:12.286
ARE REALLY THE BALK OF THE WORK

03:27:12.353 --> 03:27:14.288
FORCE THE ID SYSTEM WE STARTED

03:27:14.355 --> 03:27:16.257
WITH THE PERSONAL CARE IN WHICH

03:27:16.323 --> 03:27:16.891
FOLKS OF MANSION AND AND SOME

03:27:16.957 --> 03:27:18.192
FOLKS HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

03:27:18.259 --> 03:27:21.962
THE USE THAT PARTICULAR

03:27:22.029 --> 03:27:22.830
CLASSIFICATION.

03:27:22.897 --> 03:27:23.898
THE REASON WE START WITH THAT

03:27:23.964 --> 03:27:25.232
THOUGH IS THAT IS WHERE BEYONCE

03:27:25.299 --> 03:27:26.600
CURRENTLY ASSIGNS DIAZ PIECE OF

03:27:26.667 --> 03:27:27.368
FOLKS MAY FEEL THE DESCRIPTION

03:27:27.434 --> 03:27:28.035
DOES NOT DO JUSTICE TO WORK THAT

03:27:28.102 --> 03:27:28.636
THEY'RE DOING AND I WOULD NOT

03:27:28.702 --> 03:27:30.538
DISAGREE WITH THAT POSITION.

03:27:30.604 --> 03:27:32.006
BUT THAT IS WHAT -- FROM THE

03:27:32.072 --> 03:27:32.840
ALSO PERSPECTIVE WEATHER

03:27:32.907 --> 03:27:35.142
CLASSIFIEDS THAT WAGE REPRESENTS

03:27:35.209 --> 03:27:35.743
WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY EARNING

03:27:35.810 --> 03:27:38.979
TODAY WITHIN THE STATE OF

03:27:39.046 --> 03:27:40.514
CALIFORNIA.

03:27:40.581 --> 03:27:41.782
ORGANIZATION MY PURPOSE LONG

03:27:41.849 --> 03:27:42.917
FELT UNCOMFORTABLE RELYING ONLY

03:27:42.983 --> 03:27:44.151
ON THAT CLASSIFICATION BECAUSE

03:27:44.218 --> 03:27:49.456
WE DO THINK IT UNDERVALUES --

03:27:49.523 --> 03:27:52.092
OCCUPATIONS. TO EFFECTIVELY COME

03:27:52.159 --> 03:27:53.928
UP A WEIGHTED AVERAGE RECOGNIZE

03:27:53.994 --> 03:27:55.462
THE OTHER WORK ABOVE AND BEYOND

03:27:55.529 --> 03:27:56.931
SOME OF THE CUSTODIAL CARE THAT

03:27:56.997 --> 03:27:58.365
FOLKS ALLUDED TO EARLIER SO THE

03:27:58.432 --> 03:28:00.201
OTHER OCCUPATIONS WE USED WERE.

03:28:00.267 --> 03:28:02.069
THE PSYCHIATRIC A TO ROCK TO

03:28:02.136 --> 03:28:03.204
ACKNOWLEDGE OF FOLKS OFTENTIMES

03:28:03.270 --> 03:28:04.238
OUR BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES AND

03:28:04.305 --> 03:28:05.506
HE'D BE MANAGED AS WELL.

03:28:05.573 --> 03:28:07.107
THE HOME HEALTH AIDE AGAIN TO

03:28:07.174 --> 03:28:07.942
HELP PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL NEEDS

03:28:08.008 --> 03:28:09.410
ANOTHER RICK RICK RECREATIONAL

03:28:09.476 --> 03:28:11.612
WORKER WHICH REALLY SPEAKS TO

03:28:11.679 --> 03:28:12.146
HELPING PEOPLE ACCESS THE

03:28:12.213 --> 03:28:12.980
COMMUNITY.

03:28:13.047 --> 03:28:14.815
SO THAT REALLY IS OUR INTENT TO

03:28:14.882 --> 03:28:15.950
MAKE THAT WERE REFLECTING THE

03:28:16.016 --> 03:28:20.221
BROAD SORTS RESPONSIBILITIES

03:28:20.287 --> 03:28:22.256
THAT DIAZ PEACE HAVE.

03:28:22.323 --> 03:28:24.225
AFTER WE MADE OUR ASSUMPTIONS IN

03:28:24.291 --> 03:28:24.859
TERMS WHAT THAT JOB MAKES IS WE

03:28:24.925 --> 03:28:25.893
HAVE TO MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ON

03:28:25.960 --> 03:28:26.560
HOW TO ADJUST THE WAGES FROM THE

03:28:26.627 --> 03:28:28.629
BLS BECAUSE THAT WAS PUBLISHED

03:28:28.696 --> 03:28:30.130
THE DATA WAS AVAILABLE TO US --

03:28:30.197 --> 03:28:34.034
WHAT REFLECTED WAGES MAY?

03:28:34.101 --> 03:28:34.802
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BY NINE

03:28:34.869 --> 03:28:36.003
YEARS CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC

03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:37.605
INFORMATION FROM THAT YOU DIDN'T

03:28:37.671 --> 03:28:39.440
TAKE NATIONAL RATE CAPS IS A

03:28:39.506 --> 03:28:41.575
NATIONAL SURVEY BUT MISTER

03:28:41.642 --> 03:28:43.043
CHAIRMAN ABSOLUTELY WE USE STATE

03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:44.879
SPECIFIC DATA AND THAT IN FACT.

03:28:44.945 --> 03:28:45.646
TO COME UP WITH SOME OF THE

03:28:45.713 --> 03:28:47.815
VARIATIONS ONE RESULTS IN THE

03:28:47.882 --> 03:28:49.116
NEXT WE USE LOCAL AREA OF

03:28:49.183 --> 03:28:50.317
INFORMATION IT'S ALSO BE ABLE TO

03:28:50.384 --> 03:28:51.552
THE BLS AT ALL CALIFORNIA

03:28:51.619 --> 03:28:54.388
SPECIFIC WORK COUNTY SPECIFIC

03:28:54.455 --> 03:28:56.724
WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

03:28:56.790 --> 03:28:57.625
BUT THEN WE ALSO HAD TO FURTHER

03:28:57.691 --> 03:28:59.093
INFLATE THE WAGES TO REFLECT

03:28:59.159 --> 03:29:01.128
CHANGES THAT OCCURRED SINCE MAY

03:29:01.195 --> 03:29:01.695
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MOST

03:29:01.762 --> 03:29:03.731
NOTABLY THE RAISING THE RISING I

03:29:03.797 --> 03:29:04.999
SHOULD SAY MINIMUM WAGE WITHIN

03:29:05.065 --> 03:29:06.200
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:29:06.267 --> 03:29:07.768
SO IT'S ALWAYS IMPORT TO KEEP IN

03:29:07.835 --> 03:29:09.136
MIND THAT OUR RATES REFLECT A

03:29:09.203 --> 03:29:11.005
POINT IN TIME THE POINT IN TIME

03:29:11.071 --> 03:29:12.306
THAT WE WERE TRYING TO REFLECT

03:29:12.373 --> 03:29:13.774
IS THE COMING FISCAL YEAR

03:29:13.841 --> 03:29:17.278
ALTHOUGH AS BOTH THE DEPARTMENT

03:29:17.344 --> 03:29:17.878
FINANCE AS WELL AS A LOOKED AT

03:29:17.945 --> 03:29:19.013
LA OLD INDICATED IT WILL TAKE

03:29:19.079 --> 03:29:20.681
SOME TIME. TO IMPLEMENT THESE

03:29:20.748 --> 03:29:21.348
RATES BUT WE HAD TO START WITH

03:29:21.415 --> 03:29:22.616
WHEN IMPLEMENTATION COULD

03:29:22.683 --> 03:29:24.618
CONCEIVABLY BEGAN WHICH WAS

03:29:24.685 --> 03:29:26.186
COMING THE COMING FISCAL YEAR.

03:29:26.253 --> 03:29:28.222
SO WE ADJUST THE RATE MODELS

03:29:28.289 --> 03:29:30.491
REFLECTED INCREASE TO THIRTEEN

03:29:30.557 --> 03:29:31.492
DOLLARS AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE.

03:29:31.558 --> 03:29:33.160
BUT WE ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR

03:29:33.227 --> 03:29:34.228
GENERALIZED WAGE GROWTH WHICH

03:29:34.295 --> 03:29:35.496
THE UREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

03:29:35.562 --> 03:29:36.931
ANOTHER FEDERAL OFFICE WITHIN

03:29:36.997 --> 03:29:38.465
THE PUBLIC COMMERCE.

03:29:38.532 --> 03:29:40.334
REPORTED BE THREE POINT 6% ON AN

03:29:40.401 --> 03:29:41.435
ANNUAL BASIS HERE WITHIN THE

03:29:41.502 --> 03:29:42.836
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:29:42.903 --> 03:29:43.737
SO WE MADE THAT THOSE

03:29:43.804 --> 03:29:45.806
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BLS DATA TO

03:29:45.873 --> 03:29:47.308
KIND OF BRING THEM CURRENTS AND

03:29:47.374 --> 03:29:48.342
THE REASON I TALK ABOUT THIS

03:29:48.409 --> 03:29:50.945
BEING A POINT IN TIME IS THIS IS

03:29:51.011 --> 03:29:52.579
FOR THE COMING FISCAL YEAR.

03:29:52.646 --> 03:29:55.015
BUT AS THE LA ALWAYS INDICATED

03:29:55.082 --> 03:29:55.983
THE RATE MODELS KIND OF AN

03:29:56.050 --> 03:29:57.284
THEMSELVES BEING UPDATED CAM

03:29:57.351 --> 03:29:58.719
THAT'S A POLICY DECISION AFTER

03:29:58.786 --> 03:30:00.054
REPORTS MAY BE MADE.

03:30:00.120 --> 03:30:01.488
BUT IN A WAY TOOLS INCREASE TO

03:30:01.555 --> 03:30:03.357
FOURTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND

03:30:03.424 --> 03:30:04.258
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND FIFTY

03:30:04.325 --> 03:30:05.993
DOLLARS AN HOUR.

03:30:06.060 --> 03:30:07.328
TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THE IDEA

03:30:07.394 --> 03:30:07.962
WOULD BE THAT THE REBELS COULD

03:30:08.028 --> 03:30:09.463
THE FURTHER UPDATED TO REFLECT

03:30:09.530 --> 03:30:10.931
THE ON GOING INCREASES THE STATE

03:30:10.998 --> 03:30:11.932
MINIMUM WAGE.

03:30:11.999 --> 03:30:13.767
THE REBELS AS EXISTE REFLECT

03:30:13.834 --> 03:30:15.903
THIRTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR NOT

03:30:15.970 --> 03:30:22.609
FIFTY DOLLARS NOW BECAUSE THAT'S

03:30:22.676 --> 03:30:24.311
A COUPLE YEARS HENCE.

03:30:24.378 --> 03:30:25.179
AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS

03:30:25.245 --> 03:30:25.946
LIKE WELL SOMEONE SAID YOU

03:30:26.013 --> 03:30:26.947
DIDN'T CORPORATION.

03:30:27.014 --> 03:30:27.581
REST BREAKS AND OTHER TYPES OF

03:30:27.648 --> 03:30:28.882
THINGS WE REQUIRES WELL IS THAT

03:30:28.949 --> 03:30:29.850
BECAUSE DO YOU THINK THAT'S IS

03:30:29.917 --> 03:30:31.385
INCORPORATED INTO THAT BLS DATA

03:30:31.452 --> 03:30:33.187
OR AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DIDN'T OR

03:30:33.253 --> 03:30:34.621
DID YOU IT'S SO I DID LIKE THAT

03:30:34.688 --> 03:30:36.090
MAYBE A LITTLE INTO THE WEEDS

03:30:36.156 --> 03:30:38.492
BUT MR JOURNAL I I WOULD NOT.

03:30:38.559 --> 03:30:41.595
ARGUE THAT IT'S PART OF THE THE

03:30:41.662 --> 03:30:42.763
BUT I'M ALSO NOT A A LABOR

03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:44.064
ATTORNEY SO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY

03:30:44.131 --> 03:30:45.232
IS WE CERTAINLY RECEIVE THAT

03:30:45.299 --> 03:30:46.767
KIND OF BOTH IN WRITING HERE.

03:30:46.834 --> 03:30:48.535
TODAY AND WILL HAVE ONGOING

03:30:48.602 --> 03:30:50.404
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER AND

03:30:50.471 --> 03:30:51.071
HOW THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO

03:30:51.138 --> 03:30:52.373
CORPORATE ON THE RIGHT MODELS

03:30:52.439 --> 03:30:53.907
AFTER CONSULTING WITH.

03:30:53.974 --> 03:30:55.275
WITH MORE LEARNING LEGAL MINDS

03:30:55.342 --> 03:30:57.378
AND FIND SO THIS IS A FREE OF

03:30:57.444 --> 03:30:57.945
ANOTHER.

03:30:58.012 --> 03:30:59.613
I UNDERSTAND FROM JUST READ THE

03:30:59.680 --> 03:31:00.781
DESCRIPTION IN THERE THAT TIME

03:31:00.848 --> 03:31:01.682
TO DIG THROUGH THE WHOLE REPORT

03:31:01.749 --> 03:31:03.517
BUT FOR EXAMPLE USE MEDI CAL

03:31:03.584 --> 03:31:06.954
RATES FOR SOME OF THE PROVIDERS --

03:31:07.021 --> 03:31:08.455
SOME OFFICIALS TO PROVIDE

03:31:08.522 --> 03:31:10.691
SERVICES IT WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT

03:31:10.758 --> 03:31:12.159
CALIFORNIA'S ALMOST AT THE

03:31:12.226 --> 03:31:13.160
BOTTOM.

03:31:13.227 --> 03:31:14.928
OF THE COUNTRY -- MANY OF THE

03:31:14.995 --> 03:31:16.864
MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE

03:31:16.930 --> 03:31:18.899
SERVICES DO SO IN THE CONTEXT OF

03:31:18.966 --> 03:31:20.200
THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY.

03:31:20.267 --> 03:31:21.602
HEALTH CENTERS WHERE TO ACTUALLY

03:31:21.668 --> 03:31:24.104
GET A BILL ADDITIONAL GRANTS TO

03:31:24.171 --> 03:31:26.006
MAKE UP FOR THE COSTS SO IT MAY

03:31:26.073 --> 03:31:27.975
NOT NESTLE ACTUALLY REFLECT WHAT

03:31:28.042 --> 03:31:29.410
THE ACTUAL COST OF SERVICE

03:31:29.476 --> 03:31:30.310
BECAUSE SINCE THOSE PROVIDER

03:31:30.377 --> 03:31:31.011
ACTUALLY.

03:31:31.078 --> 03:31:32.046
GET A DIGITAL FEDERAL FUNDS

03:31:32.112 --> 03:31:33.447
BEYOND THAT MEDI CAL

03:31:33.514 --> 03:31:34.815
REIMBURSEMENT RATE.

03:31:34.882 --> 03:31:36.450
SO I WONDERED IF YOU COULD

03:31:36.517 --> 03:31:38.285
EXPLAIN TO ME WHY MEDI CAL RATE

03:31:38.352 --> 03:31:40.654
WAS THE MOST APPROPRIATE VERSES

03:31:40.721 --> 03:31:42.956
A MORE -- RATE LIKE MEDICARE

03:31:43.023 --> 03:31:43.957
ACTUALLY SOME OF OUR MEDICARE

03:31:44.024 --> 03:31:45.059
MANAGED CARE PLANS TO USE

03:31:45.125 --> 03:31:46.593
MEDICARE RATES THEY FOUND OUT

03:31:46.660 --> 03:31:47.995
THAT THAT IS THE ACTUAL TRULY

03:31:48.062 --> 03:31:49.496
MORE COMPETITIVE RATE.

03:31:49.563 --> 03:31:51.565
OR COMMERCIAL RATES WHICH ARE

03:31:51.632 --> 03:31:52.499
EVEN HIGHER TO MEDICARE RATES

03:31:52.566 --> 03:31:53.967
AWAY MEDI CAL RATES WHICH

03:31:54.034 --> 03:31:59.973
CLEARLY THERE'S A LOT OF

03:32:00.040 --> 03:32:00.574
EVIDENCE TO SHOW LESS YOU HAVE

03:32:00.641 --> 03:32:01.642
THAT.

03:32:01.708 --> 03:32:02.543
YOU KNOW ADJUSTMENT THE PBS

03:32:02.609 --> 03:32:03.677
ADJUSTMENTS -- USUALLY DOESN'T

03:32:03.744 --> 03:32:05.212
ENOUGH TO COVER THE COSTS.

03:32:05.279 --> 03:32:10.117
MISTER CHAIRMAN SO AS A KIND

03:32:10.184 --> 03:32:10.717
OPENING REVIEW OF THE SERVICE

03:32:10.784 --> 03:32:14.855
SYSTEM -- AS A GENERAL RULE DDS.

03:32:14.922 --> 03:32:15.689
IS THERE RATES FOR MEDICAL

03:32:15.756 --> 03:32:17.658
PROFESSIONALS. TO THE MEDICARE

03:32:17.724 --> 03:32:18.826
FEE SCHEDULE WHAT THEY REFER TO

03:32:18.892 --> 03:32:20.194
THE SCUTTLED MAXIMUM ALLOWANCES

03:32:20.260 --> 03:32:21.128
SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

03:32:21.195 --> 03:32:22.830
IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO THE RACE

03:32:22.896 --> 03:32:26.200
STUDY -- BEGINNING ONE WE TALKED

03:32:26.266 --> 03:32:27.367
ABOUT HOW.

03:32:27.434 --> 03:32:28.168
SOME OF THE MISCELLANEOUS

03:32:28.235 --> 03:32:29.236
SERVICE BECAUSE OF A USED --

03:32:29.303 --> 03:32:30.337
OUTSIDE THAT FEW SKETCH WE TALK

03:32:30.404 --> 03:32:31.572
ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO WRAP IT

03:32:31.638 --> 03:32:32.940
BACK INTO THAT GENERALIZE

03:32:33.006 --> 03:32:34.475
CONCEPT OF IF IT'S A MEDICAL

03:32:34.541 --> 03:32:35.776
PROFESSIONAL LIKE A THERAPIST IT

03:32:35.843 --> 03:32:37.111
OUGHT TO BE TIED BACK TO THE

03:32:37.177 --> 03:32:38.345
MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE.

03:32:38.412 --> 03:32:39.680
SO THAT WAS THE THOUGHT PROCESS

03:32:39.746 --> 03:32:40.948
IS THAT WAS THE EXISTING

03:32:41.014 --> 03:32:42.983
FRAMEWORK THAT EXISTS TODAY.

03:32:43.050 --> 03:32:47.387
AS I THINK YOU MENTIONED WE DID

03:32:47.454 --> 03:32:48.021
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE TIMES

03:32:48.088 --> 03:32:49.022
WHEN.

03:32:49.089 --> 03:32:49.790
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ABOUT

03:32:49.857 --> 03:32:51.091
BEYOND THE MEDI CAL FEES GO TO

03:32:51.158 --> 03:32:51.658
BE APPROPRIATE SO WE PUT THE

03:32:51.725 --> 03:32:52.726
POTENTIAL FOR THAT AUGMENTATION

03:32:52.793 --> 03:32:54.128
OF OF 40%.

03:32:54.194 --> 03:32:56.230
WHICH IS BORROWING FROM POLICIES

03:32:56.296 --> 03:32:57.030
AVAILABLE IN THE CHECK

03:32:57.097 --> 03:32:58.031
CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES

03:32:58.098 --> 03:33:00.267
PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN POSITIONS

03:33:00.334 --> 03:33:01.568
SERVICES.

03:33:01.635 --> 03:33:02.903
TOLD ME THAT WHEN YOU'RE

03:33:02.970 --> 03:33:03.504
SPECIFICALLY ASKED ME HOW WE

03:33:03.570 --> 03:33:04.104
ARRIVED THERE THAT'S HOW WE

03:33:04.171 --> 03:33:05.472
ARRIVED THERE AGAIN CERTAINLY

03:33:05.539 --> 03:33:06.907
WE'VE HEARD FEEDBACK FROM

03:33:06.974 --> 03:33:08.809
THERAPEUTIC OF SERVICE PROVIDERS

03:33:08.876 --> 03:33:09.910
AS WELL AS AN INFANT EARLY TO

03:33:09.977 --> 03:33:11.278
BED EARLY INFANT DEVELOPMENT

03:33:11.345 --> 03:33:12.379
PROGRAMS AS WELL.

03:33:12.446 --> 03:33:13.380
AND THAT'S PART OF THE

03:33:13.447 --> 03:33:15.115
CONSIDERATION PROCESS WERE WERE

03:33:15.182 --> 03:33:16.250
CURRENTLY UNDERTAKE.

03:33:16.316 --> 03:33:18.218
TAKINGS PARTIES PUBLIC CONCERTS

03:33:18.285 --> 03:33:20.420
SO USUALLY EM MEDIC TELLS NOT

03:33:20.487 --> 03:33:22.122
THE SORT OF THE BEST BENCHMARK --

03:33:22.189 --> 03:33:24.691
SO I THINK HOPEFULLY -- WE CAN

03:33:24.758 --> 03:33:25.759
LOOK AT DEL BUT IT'S SO

03:33:25.826 --> 03:33:27.394
HOPEFULLY THAT CAN BE VISITED

03:33:27.461 --> 03:33:28.729
I'M SURE YOU'LL GET SOME

03:33:28.795 --> 03:33:30.063
FEEDBACK ON THAT BUT CERTAINLY

03:33:30.130 --> 03:33:32.666
IS THIS COMMITTEE WE ALSO

03:33:32.733 --> 03:33:34.101
OVERSEE DTS AND MEDI CAL.

03:33:34.168 --> 03:33:35.269
AND A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

03:33:35.335 --> 03:33:41.141
MEDI CAL RATES AND THE ALL THE

03:33:41.208 --> 03:33:42.676
DIFFERENT.

03:33:42.743 --> 03:33:43.544
BOB DOLE SOURCES OF FUNDS THAT

03:33:43.610 --> 03:33:46.346
FLOW INTO -- AND AND AND TO WHAT

03:33:46.413 --> 03:33:47.514
WHAT FRAZIER WHAT PEOPLE

03:33:47.581 --> 03:33:48.649
ACTUALLY GET YOU ARE TAKING CARE

03:33:48.715 --> 03:33:50.050
MEDI CAL PATIENTS CELL.

03:33:50.117 --> 03:33:52.119
AND OFTEN THEIR CROSS SUBSIDIZED

03:33:52.186 --> 03:33:53.020
SO THE MOST YOU ALSO INCLUDE THE

03:33:53.086 --> 03:33:54.188
VALUE OF THE ABOUT ACROSS

03:33:54.254 --> 03:33:55.556
SUBSIDIES OR OTHER SOURCES

03:33:55.622 --> 03:33:56.623
YOU'RE NOT REALLY YOU KNOW

03:33:56.690 --> 03:33:59.626
CAPTURING WHAT.

03:33:59.693 --> 03:34:01.061
IS NEEDED CELL.

03:34:01.128 --> 03:34:03.363
AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER -- IT

03:34:03.430 --> 03:34:04.264
WAS BROUGHT UP TO I MEAN I'M A

03:34:04.331 --> 03:34:04.865
GET A MENTION OF TEACHER XIN

03:34:04.932 --> 03:34:06.633
EARLY INTERVENTION AND NOT

03:34:06.700 --> 03:34:09.169
FRAGMENTING AND SO.

03:34:09.236 --> 03:34:12.606
WHEN WE SAW IN TERMS OF -- AND

03:34:12.673 --> 03:34:13.707
COMING UP WITH THE METHODOLOGY

HOW TO TAKE CARE OF WE WANT TO

03:34:15.108 --> 03:34:16.376
DO TEAM BASED CARE TEAM BASED

03:34:16.443 --> 03:34:21.181
EVALUATION AND SO IS IS THAT.

03:34:21.248 --> 03:34:23.417
IS THAT THE TERMS OF I'M SURE

03:34:23.483 --> 03:34:24.418

WHEN WE'RE ROLLING OUT THE

03:34:56.250 --> 03:34:57.784
STRUCTURE OF THE MODELS.

03:34:57.851 --> 03:34:58.752
THAT SOME OF THE EARLY

03:34:58.819 --> 03:35:00.554
INTERVENTION PROVIDERS HAD

03:35:00.621 --> 03:35:02.356
SHARED THOSE CONCERNS EVEN AT

03:35:02.422 --> 03:35:04.124

DISCUSSION I ONE AT A TIME A

03:36:00.814 --> 03:36:01.782
LITTLE BIT OF TIME LINE THAT'S

03:36:01.848 --> 03:36:02.816
LIKE WHEN SHOULD WE COME BACK

THE PATH WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH.

03:36:18.165 --> 03:36:20.367
TO ADJUSTMENTS OR ARE THERE SOME

03:36:20.434 --> 03:36:25.505
OTHER PATH RINGO AT SOME POINT

03:36:25.572 --> 03:36:26.006
WE SEE AFTER YOU GET THE

03:36:26.073 --> 03:36:27.107

ABOUT THIS -- LOW EARLIER ABOUT

03:36:39.286 --> 03:36:41.221
BY QUARTERS THE THINKING OF THE

03:36:41.288 --> 03:36:42.522
DEPARTMENT NOW I WE'VE SPENT ALL

03:36:42.589 --> 03:36:44.458
THIS WE SPENT THREE YEARS ON THE

03:36:44.524 --> 03:36:44.658
CITY.

GET I I DON'T WANT TO I'M NOT

03:36:59.740 --> 03:37:01.708
DISMISSING -- THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:37:01.775 --> 03:37:02.909
THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE EARLY

03:37:02.976 --> 03:37:04.644
START AND TAKING A LOOK AT KIND

03:37:04.711 --> 03:37:07.214
OF THE THE KIND OF THE GROUP AND

BACK -- BUT I I'M GOING TO KIND

03:37:10.217 --> 03:37:13.687
OF COMPARE IT TO WHEN WE TAKE A

03:37:13.754 --> 03:37:15.155
LOOK AT THE RATE MODELS WHEN

03:37:15.222 --> 03:37:16.123
WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR THE

03:37:16.189 --> 03:37:17.457
ELEMENTS THAT ARE IN THE RIGHT

03:37:17.524 --> 03:37:19.326
MODELS INFORMING US.

03:38:23.924 --> 03:38:25.392
PRIORITY IN THE PRIORITY OF OUR

03:38:25.459 --> 03:38:27.160
CONSULTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:38:27.227 --> 03:38:29.463

03:38:30.897 --> 03:38:33.033
PART OF OUR TRANSPARENCY PIECE

03:38:33.099 --> 03:38:34.334
OF OUR RATES STUDY IS TO SAY

03:38:34.401 --> 03:38:35.769
HERE'S THE COMMENTS THAT WOULD

03:38:35.836 --> 03:38:37.437
HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND MAKING

03:38:49.449 --> 03:38:50.350
REALLY IT IS ABOUT THAT'S RIGHT

03:38:50.417 --> 03:38:52.085
THE BIGGER QUESTION IS IS THAT

03:38:52.152 --> 03:38:53.587
ARE WE RESTRUCTURING THE WAY

03:38:53.653 --> 03:38:54.488

03:38:55.889 --> 03:38:58.592
RIGHT AND THAT'S DEL AND

03:38:58.658 --> 03:38:59.993
OBVIOUSLY WE SPENT THIS TIME AND

03:39:00.060 --> 03:39:01.261
EFFORT DOING GREAT STUDY -- WE

03:39:01.328 --> 03:39:03.129
HEARD FROM LA -- SAYING THAT TOO

03:39:03.196 --> 03:39:04.498

I UNDERSTAND MAYBE JUST THIS IS

03:39:11.171 --> 03:39:12.739
NOT THE TIME YET TO MAKE THE

03:39:12.806 --> 03:39:13.874
COMMITMENT.

03:39:13.940 --> 03:39:16.042
AND WHETHER YOU FEEL THAT IT

03:39:16.109 --> 03:39:16.977
SHOULD MAKE THE COMMITMENT

03:39:17.043 --> 03:39:18.011
TOWARDS -- YOU KNOW YOU'D BE

03:39:18.078 --> 03:39:19.513

03:39:32.726 --> 03:39:34.461
IS TO UNDERSTAND.

ONCE YOU HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS

03:39:35.529 --> 03:39:37.330

IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

03:39:44.938 --> 03:39:46.373
IMMEDIATELY IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME

SPECIALISTS THAT I SUPERVISE --

03:57:36.508 --> 03:57:37.309
THE EIGHT OH FIVE INFILL

03:57:37.376 --> 03:57:38.077
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE

03:57:38.143 --> 03:57:39.678
DESIGNED TO WORK AS A TEAM TO

03:57:39.745 --> 03:57:40.446
DELIVER EARLY INTERVENTION

03:57:40.512 --> 03:57:41.880
SERVICES IN A TRANCE

03:57:41.947 --> 03:57:43.182
DISCIPLINARY APPROACH.

03:57:43.248 --> 03:57:45.050
SEPARATING OUT OF THESE SERVICES

03:57:45.117 --> 03:57:46.151
WOULD NOT BE CONDUCIVE TO THIS

03:57:46.218 --> 03:57:47.186
APPROACH AND WOULD MAKE IT

03:57:47.252 --> 03:57:49.054
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THE POS

03:57:49.121 --> 03:57:50.356
PROCESS BETWEEN THE REGIONAL

03:57:50.422 --> 03:57:51.690

03:57:51.757 --> 03:57:53.192
THERE IS CONCERN FOR OVER THE

03:57:53.258 --> 03:57:54.860
OVER ESTIMATE OF THE TWENTY SIX

03:57:54.927 --> 03:57:56.261
WEEKLY VISITS INDICATED IN THE

03:57:56.328 --> 03:57:57.262
RATE MODEL PROPOSED.

03:57:57.329 --> 03:57:58.464
THIS MODEL IMPLIES THAT MORE

03:57:58.530 --> 03:58:00.099
THAN HALF OF THE THIRTY SEVEN

03:58:00.165 --> 03:58:02.001
AND A HALF FULL TIME HOURS PER

03:58:02.067 --> 03:58:02.768
WEEK WOULD BE USED ON HOME

03:58:02.835 --> 03:58:03.636
VISITS.

03:58:03.702 --> 03:58:05.037
THIS DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE

03:58:05.104 --> 03:58:06.205
TRAVEL TIME BETWEEN CLIENTS WHO

03:58:06.271 --> 03:58:07.640
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE IN

03:58:07.706 --> 03:58:08.941
REMOTE LOCATIONS WHAT IS A

03:58:09.008 --> 03:58:10.275
CONSIDER THE DOCUMENTATION

03:58:10.342 --> 03:58:11.844
REQUIRED TO STAY IN COMPLIANCE

03:58:11.910 --> 03:58:14.179
WITH THE ID A LAWS.

03:58:14.246 --> 03:58:15.447
AROUND THE AYE OFFICE P. PROCESS.

03:58:15.514 --> 03:58:17.249
CBS'S ARE OFTEN USED TO KEEP AN

03:58:17.316 --> 03:58:18.317
EYE ON THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT

03:58:18.384 --> 03:58:20.052
OF THE CHILD AND TO REINFORCE

03:58:20.119 --> 03:58:21.553
THE OUTCOME SET BY THE OTHER

03:58:21.620 --> 03:58:22.554
DISCIPLINES.

03:58:22.621 --> 03:58:23.956
THEREFORE SUPPORTING THE FAMILY

03:58:24.023 --> 03:58:28.360
AND CHILD THROUGHOUT THEIR TIME

03:58:28.427 --> 03:58:29.495
IN EARLY INTERVENTION.

03:58:29.561 --> 03:58:30.029
WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE

03:58:30.095 --> 03:58:30.696
PROPOSED A PERCENT RATE INCREASE

03:58:30.763 --> 03:58:31.697
THAT WILL BE CRUCIAL TO CONTINUE

03:58:31.764 --> 03:58:32.965
TO PROVIDE SERVICES UNTIL RATE

03:58:33.032 --> 03:58:34.266
MALL JUST READ THAT COVERS

03:58:34.333 --> 03:58:36.602
EXPENSES IS ENACTED THANK YOU.

03:58:36.669 --> 03:58:37.770

03:58:37.836 --> 03:58:40.005
WELCOME.

03:58:40.072 --> 03:58:41.874
MY NAME IS JACKIE CLARK AND I

03:58:41.940 --> 03:58:44.209
HAVE BEEN A ADMINISTRATOR AND

03:58:44.276 --> 03:58:46.011
AND PROGRAMS FOR FORTY THREE

03:58:46.078 --> 03:58:46.512
YEARS.

03:58:46.578 --> 03:58:48.781
AND I'VE -- HAD GREAT HOPE THAT

03:58:48.847 --> 03:58:50.282
ONE DAY WILL BE ABLE.

03:58:50.349 --> 03:58:52.418
TO REVISE THE RATE MODEL SO I'M

03:58:52.484 --> 03:58:53.686
EXCITED THAT WE'LL GET TO THAT

03:58:53.752 --> 03:58:54.620
LEVEL.

03:58:54.687 --> 03:58:56.155
I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT I

03:58:56.221 --> 03:59:00.192
WANTED TO BRING UP ABOUT THE THE

03:59:00.259 --> 03:59:03.195
DRAFT PROPOSAL AND I THINK THAT

03:59:03.262 --> 03:59:05.364
THE TWO BIGGEST FACTORS ARE.

03:59:05.431 --> 03:59:07.166
THE PRODUCTIVITY ASSUMPTION THAT

03:59:07.232 --> 03:59:10.135
WE CAN SEE I'M TWENTY SEVEN

03:59:10.202 --> 03:59:12.871
FAMILIES A WEEK -- WINS IN OUR

03:59:12.938 --> 03:59:15.507
COUNTY WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND

03:59:15.574 --> 03:59:16.642
WENTY MILES BETWEEN OUR FOR

03:59:16.709 --> 03:59:20.412
THIS -- FAMILIES AND SO IT DOES --

03:59:20.479 --> 03:59:23.449
TAKE ALL DAVE -- OF TRAVELING TO

03:59:23.515 --> 03:59:25.984
SEE THREE TO FOUR KIDS ON A DAY

03:59:26.051 --> 03:59:26.752
SO.

03:59:26.819 --> 03:59:28.287
REALISTICALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT

03:59:28.353 --> 03:59:30.322
MORE OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY

03:59:30.389 --> 03:59:30.856
MINUTES.

03:59:30.923 --> 03:59:32.458
A WEEK INSTEAD OF TWENTY SEVEN

03:59:32.524 --> 03:59:34.393
BUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT IS

03:59:34.460 --> 03:59:36.595
THE BILLABLE -- RATE PER HOUR

03:59:36.662 --> 03:59:37.463
WAS REALLY SET ON THAT

03:59:37.529 --> 03:59:39.398
PRODUCTIVITY LOVERS LEVELS ARE

03:59:39.465 --> 03:59:45.838
REALLY DROVE THE RATES DOWN.

03:59:45.904 --> 03:59:46.305
BUT I THINK EVEN MORE

03:59:46.371 --> 03:59:48.340
SIGNIFICANTLY IS IF WE HAD TO

03:59:48.407 --> 03:59:50.709
HIRE -- T. SPECIES AND SPEECH ON

03:59:50.776 --> 03:59:52.144
MEDI CAL RATES BECAUSE WITHOUT

03:59:52.211 --> 03:59:55.013
THE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTED BE

03:59:55.080 --> 03:59:55.447
TWENTY NINE DOLLARS.

03:59:55.514 --> 03:59:57.750
AND WE PAID. TWENTY NINE DOLLARS

03:59:57.816 --> 03:59:59.718
JUSTIN TRAVEL FOR THE DAY AND WE

03:59:59.785 --> 04:00:01.186
WOULD HAVE NOTHING LEFT OVER FOR

04:00:01.253 --> 04:00:03.589
SALARIES THANK YOU THANK YOU

04:00:03.655 --> 04:00:03.889
[inaudible]

04:00:03.956 --> 04:00:05.557
WELCOME.

04:00:05.624 --> 04:00:06.725
HI MY NAME IS CHRISTINA MICHAEL

04:00:06.792 --> 04:00:07.860
ALBERS AND I'M EXECUTIVE

04:00:07.926 --> 04:00:09.428
DIRECTOR OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

04:00:09.495 --> 04:00:10.629
CHILDREN'S THERAPY CENTER WHERE

04:00:10.696 --> 04:00:11.930
A PRIVATE NON PROFIT WHOSE

04:00:11.997 --> 04:00:13.532
MISSION IS THAT NO CHILD SHOULD

04:00:13.599 --> 04:00:15.033
GO THROUGH LIFE WITH A

04:00:15.100 --> 04:00:16.502
DISABILITY THAT CAN BE AIDED FOR

04:00:16.568 --> 04:00:17.136
PREVENTED THROUGH EARLY

04:00:17.202 --> 04:00:18.237
INTERVENTION.

04:00:18.303 --> 04:00:19.571
WE HAVE BEEN A VENDOR DIFFERENT

04:00:19.638 --> 04:00:21.907
PROGRAM OF THE REGIONAL CENTER

04:00:21.974 --> 04:00:22.841
FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS I HAVE

04:00:22.908 --> 04:00:24.409
TWO ISSUES THAT I WANT TO DRESS

04:00:24.476 --> 04:00:25.277
VERY QUICKLY REGARDING THE RATE

04:00:25.344 --> 04:00:26.745
STUDY AND THESE ARE ISSUES THAT

04:00:26.812 --> 04:00:28.514
WILL DO HARM FIRST THE

04:00:28.580 --> 04:00:30.382
RECOMMENDATION TO REIMBURSE.

04:00:30.449 --> 04:00:31.650
INFANT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

04:00:31.717 --> 04:00:33.185
THERAPY AT MEDI CAL RATES IS

04:00:33.252 --> 04:00:35.621
GROSSLY UNSUSTAINABLE IF THAT

04:00:35.687 --> 04:00:38.223
HAPPENED OUR PROGRAM WOULD SEE A

04:00:38.290 --> 04:00:39.925
24254% REDUCTION IN OUR CURRENT

04:00:39.992 --> 04:00:42.828
HOURLY RATE WHICH IS ALREADY

04:00:42.895 --> 04:00:43.495
FORTY FIVE DOLLARS LESS THAN OUR

04:00:43.562 --> 04:00:44.696
COST.

04:00:44.763 --> 04:00:45.898
THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE REASON

04:00:45.964 --> 04:00:47.266
REGIONAL CENTER LOSING US AS A

04:00:47.332 --> 04:00:48.634
VENDOR AND THE HUNDREDS OF

04:00:48.700 --> 04:00:49.935
CHILDREN THAT WE SERVE WOULD GO

04:00:50.002 --> 04:00:51.136
WITHOUT SERVICE.

04:00:51.203 --> 04:00:53.105
SECOND QUICKLY IS A SEPARATION

04:00:53.172 --> 04:00:54.740
OF ID P. SERVICES IN TWO

04:00:54.807 --> 04:00:56.175
DIFFERENT BILLABLE CATEGORIES

04:00:56.241 --> 04:00:57.609
WOULD RESULT IN A LESS EFFECTIVE

04:00:57.676 --> 04:00:59.111
EARLY INTERVENTION THE INTENT OF

04:00:59.178 --> 04:01:00.512
EARLY INTERVENTION IN BOTH

04:01:00.579 --> 04:01:02.447
REGULATION AND BEST PRACTICE IS

04:01:02.514 --> 04:01:04.783
TO FOCUS ON THE WHOLE CHILD

04:01:04.850 --> 04:01:08.453
WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO.

04:01:08.520 --> 04:01:10.289
EFFECTIVE.

04:01:10.355 --> 04:01:10.823
ON DOING THE STRUCTURE THE

04:01:10.889 --> 04:01:11.490
PROGRAM WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO

04:01:11.557 --> 04:01:12.724
OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN AN

04:01:12.791 --> 04:01:16.295

04:01:37.516 --> 04:01:38.584

THE FOLLOWING ONE THE RATE STUDY

04:02:48.287 --> 04:02:50.422

WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON

05:46:11.584 --> 05:46:13.586

05:46:44.683 --> 05:46:46.352
RECENT STUDY THAT HAS SHOWN THAT --

05:46:46.418 --> 05:46:47.953
SUICIDE RATES IN SKILLED NURSING

05:46:48.020 --> 05:46:50.156

05:48:11.103 --> 05:48:11.770
THOUSAND KIDS.

05:48:11.837 --> 05:48:13.272
POTENTIALLY BENEFITING FROM THIS

05:48:13.339 --> 05:48:16.775
APPROACH SO IT CAN REALLY SCALE.

05:48:16.842 --> 05:48:18.944
FQHCS ARE IDEAL SETTINGS TO TILT

05:48:19.011 --> 05:48:21.380
TO DELIVER PARENTING INFORMATION.

05:48:21.447 --> 05:48:23.415
PARENT TEEN IMPACTS IN MEDIATES

05:48:23.482 --> 05:48:24.917
VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF CHILD

05:48:24.984 --> 05:48:26.318
HEALTH.

05:48:26.385 --> 05:48:28.053
IT'S DIFFICULT TO THINK OF ONE

05:48:28.120 --> 05:48:30.122
ASPECT THAT DOESN'T DEPEND UPON

05:48:30.189 --> 05:48:32.558
PARENTS INCLUDING WHETHER KID

05:48:32.625 --> 05:48:34.293
MAKES IT TO AN APPOINTMENT.

05:48:34.360 --> 05:48:35.928
IN PRACTICE EVIDENCE BASED

05:48:35.995 --> 05:48:37.696
PARENTING INFORMATION HASN'T

05:48:37.763 --> 05:48:39.298
BEEN TRANSMITTED TO PARENTS AS

05:48:39.365 --> 05:48:40.666
WELL AS IT COULD AND THIS IS

05:48:40.733 --> 05:48:43.469
PRIMARILY DUE TO A LACK OF

05:48:43.535 --> 05:48:45.004
RESOURCES.

05:48:45.070 --> 05:48:45.838
THE PC PEAS AND BEHAVIORAL

05:48:45.904 --> 05:48:47.706
HEALTH STAFF SIMPLY DON'T HAVE

05:48:47.773 --> 05:48:50.242
ACCESS TO PARENTING E. BP'S.

05:48:50.309 --> 05:48:52.177
SO THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES ACCESS

05:48:52.244 --> 05:48:53.712
TO PARENTS WHO DESIRE PARENTING

05:48:53.779 --> 05:48:54.880
INFORMATION.

05:48:54.947 --> 05:48:56.081
AND THE INFORMATION IS

05:48:56.148 --> 05:48:58.150
STRENGTHENED BECAUSE THE

05:48:58.217 --> 05:48:59.618
REFERRALS INTO THE SYSTEM COME

05:48:59.685 --> 05:49:01.120
FROM A TRUSTED SOURCE YOUR

05:49:01.186 --> 05:49:03.522
DOCTOR AND PEER PA.

05:49:03.589 --> 05:49:04.957
YOUR SOCIAL WORKER.

05:49:05.024 --> 05:49:06.925
THERE IS A WIDENING GAP BETWEEN

05:49:06.992 --> 05:49:08.527
BEST PRACTICES AND STANDARDS OF

05:49:08.594 --> 05:49:10.429
CARE FOR WORKING WITH FOR

05:49:10.496 --> 05:49:12.231
EXAMPLE CHILDREN WITH ADHD OR

SOME OTHER DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR

05:49:14.199 --> 05:49:15.134
PROBLEMS IN THE SETTINGS.

05:49:15.200 --> 05:49:17.303
NON PHARMACOLOGIC EVIDENCE BASED

05:49:17.369 --> 05:49:19.204
TREATMENTS FOR THESE PROBLEMS

05:49:19.271 --> 05:49:21.340
EXIST THEY WORK AND ARE PROMOTED

05:49:21.407 --> 05:49:23.976
BY THE CDC AN H. P..

05:49:24.043 --> 05:49:25.077
BUT WE ARE STILL FACED WITH

05:49:25.144 --> 05:49:27.746
BARRIERS AND ACCESS AND DELIVERY

05:49:27.813 --> 05:49:29.748
WE KNOW PARENTS SEEK THIS

05:49:29.815 --> 05:49:30.949
INFORMATION ONLINE.

05:49:31.016 --> 05:49:32.484

05:49:36.622 --> 05:49:37.756
SECONDS.

05:49:37.823 --> 05:49:39.992
SO WHERE IS A PARENT SUPPOSED TO

05:49:40.059 --> 05:49:41.627
START OKAY SEARCH ALGORITHM

05:49:41.694 --> 05:49:43.028
BUSINESS IT ISN'T SMART ENOUGH

05:49:43.095 --> 05:49:44.763

LAST TWO YEARS REALLY LOOKING AT

06:24:34.818 --> 06:24:35.719
THIS MODEL THAT WAS ORIGINALLY

06:24:35.786 --> 06:24:37.120
DEVELOPED IN AUSTRALIA AND

06:24:37.187 --> 06:24:38.422
EXPANDED AROUND THE WORLD

06:24:38.488 --> 06:24:41.691
ACTUALLY WE WERE ABLE TO VISIT

06:24:41.758 --> 06:24:42.659
WITH THAT THE SITES IN VANCOUVER

AND THERE'S EVIDENCE.

06:24:50.600 --> 06:24:52.302
PRIMARILY OUT OF AUSTRALIA BUT

06:24:52.369 --> 06:24:53.870
EMERGING EVIDENCE IN CANADA.

06:24:53.937 --> 06:24:57.441
THAT THIS IDEA OF DESIGNING USE

06:24:57.507 --> 06:24:59.142
DROP IN CENTERS WITH KEY

06:24:59.209 --> 06:25:00.610
CHARACTERISTICS THAT IT IS YOUTH

06:25:00.677 --> 06:25:03.313
DRIVEN USE BRANDON IS PROMOTED.

06:25:03.380 --> 06:25:05.048
THAT IT PROVIDES INTEGRATED CARE

06:25:05.115 --> 06:25:06.817
FROM MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL

06:25:06.883 --> 06:25:08.952

CAN BETTER SERVE USE PRIMARILY

06:25:17.727 --> 06:25:19.229
BECAUSE USE ARE MORE WILLING TO

06:25:19.296 --> 06:25:21.431
ACCESS THESE SERVICES BECAUSE OF

06:25:21.498 --> 06:25:22.866
THEIR ROLE ON THE FRONT END

06:25:22.933 --> 06:25:24.234
WE'RE ALSO SEEING THAT THERE'S

06:25:24.301 --> 06:25:26.203
GREATER PERSISTENCE IN TERMS OF

06:25:26.269 --> 06:25:27.904
THE DELIVERY OF CARE PRIMARILY

06:25:27.971 --> 06:25:29.639
BECAUSE OF THE INTEGRATION.

06:25:29.706 --> 06:25:32.008
THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT

06:25:32.075 --> 06:25:33.043
OUTCOMES IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY.

06:25:33.109 --> 06:25:34.010
THE FUNDING REQUEST IS TO

06:25:34.077 --> 06:25:36.079
RECOGNIZE THAT MANY COUNTIES

06:25:36.146 --> 06:25:37.214
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES

06:25:37.280 --> 06:25:38.281
AVAILABLE TO START THIS

06:25:38.348 --> 06:25:39.683
INITIATIVE AND IT WOULD ALLOW

06:25:39.749 --> 06:25:41.485
THE STATE TO REALLY SHAPE.

06:25:41.551 --> 06:25:42.986
THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES

06:25:43.053 --> 06:25:45.155
STATEWIDE AND SO THE REQUEST IS

06:25:45.222 --> 06:25:45.789
FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

06:25:45.856 --> 06:25:48.425

06:25:56.533 --> 06:25:57.567
RESEARCH AND EVALUATION TO

INCLUDED IN THAT OF COURSE AS

06:26:01.204 --> 06:26:03.440
YOU UNDERSTAND IS THE CAPACITY

ABLE TO DO THAT.

06:26:15.519 --> 06:26:16.786
AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED THAT THIS

06:26:16.853 --> 06:26:18.288
IS A MODEL THAT REALLY WOULD

06:26:18.355 --> 06:26:19.956
ALLOW THE STATE TO DESIGN MENTAL

06:26:20.023 --> 06:26:21.625
