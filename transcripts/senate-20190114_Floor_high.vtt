BECAUSE SHE QUOTE CAME ON TOO

00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:28.304
STRONG FOR A WOMAN.

00:58:28.371 --> 00:58:29.639
I'M LOOKING AROUND THIS ROOM

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:30.506
HERE.

OF US HERE.

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:36.212
OF OUR GENDER.

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:37.914
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO BE TOO

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:40.183

SHE DID SOME READING AND

00:58:55.965 --> 00:58:58.001
DISCOVERED THAT.

00:58:58.067 --> 00:59:00.136
THERE WAS A LITTLE KNOWN CLAUSE

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:02.272
IN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.

00:59:02.338 --> 00:59:04.474

DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENDER

00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:11.614
IN AWARDING FEDERAL CONTRACTS.

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:13.049
THAT HAD BEEN --

00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:15.418

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:35.638
AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:37.573
ACTIONS WHICH LED TO THE

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:41.311
EVENTUAL CRAFTING OF TITLE.

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:43.446

TWENTY THIRTEEN BUT OF THE MANY

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:54.424
STORIES THAT I'VE READ ABOUT

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:55.992
BUNNY.

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:57.760
MY FAVORITE IS THE ONE WHERE THE

00:59:57.827 --> 00:59:59.862
COST MOST CLUBS IN WASHINGTON DC

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:02.699
DIDN'T ALLOW WOMEN UNTIL

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:03.633
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND IF YOU

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.133
WERE.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.469
GOING TO BE ASKED TO SPEAK THERE

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.438
YOU AS A WOMAN W'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:11.240
GO IN THE BACK DOOR.

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:12.675
WHICH SHE REFUSED TO DO.

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:14.377
AND BECAUSE SHE WAS SO ANNOYED

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:17.347
BY THIS SHE CARRIED WITH HER

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:20.950
DOZENS OF OF THE STICKERS THAT

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:24.554

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.521
AND ONE OF THE WAITERS AT THE

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:28.858
COSMOS CLUB HE ASKED HER FOR

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:30.727
HANDFUL OF THEM WHICH HE THEN

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.495
