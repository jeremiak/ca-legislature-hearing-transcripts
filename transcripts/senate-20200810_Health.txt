TO PRESENT THIS BILL AND I'M HONORED TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL I WANTED. RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE STATEMENT ON THE COLLAR IS MADE THAT. IT WON'T HELP INMY OPINION DOING NOTHING AT ALL IS NOT AN OPTION. I ARE DISCUSSED WITH THE AUTHOR ARE WERE BASED ON A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT I SEE OVER THE YEARS. AS AN EDUCATOR A TEACHER FIRST AREAS. WERE WELL AWARE THAT. THE SITE WAS INCREASE AMONG OUR TEENS IN OUR SCHOOL AND- BASED ON THE- DIPLOMA PUBLIC. WHERE DID WAS THE SECOND LEADING ATTEMPT AMONG TEENS. AND YOUNG ADULTS BETWEEN THE OF A AND TWENTY FOUR HEARING AS A LOCAL. MEMBER I ALSO HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF GETTING ALL THE TEXT MESSAGES AND INFORMATION WHEN HE- WOULD FIND SOMEONE DISEASE BASED ON YOU KNOW BY SUICIDE AND SO THERE WERE MANY CASES. I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY CLOTHING NINETEEN HAS REALLY. ISOLATED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME AS IT WAS PRIOR TO CLOTHING EIGHTEEN WE- WE ALREADY WERE DEALING WITH AN INCREASE IN SUICIDE WE ALREADY DEALING WITH THE SITUATION. AND THAT. IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANY BETTER I ALREADY KNOW ALL TEENAGERS TO OUR- THERE I. DON'T HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM AND PARENTS AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE- CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SLIPS TOUCHES EVERY SINGLE PROFESSION EVERY SINGLE E. FOR EVERY SINGLE. COMMUNITY WE HEARD OF TRIBAL ENTITY. I HAD A FRIEND WHOSE HUSBAND. COMMITTED SUICIDE FORMER VETERAN POLICE OFFICER. A LOT OF WAYS A COMMUNITY DON'T WASTE SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY NO. IN MY OPINION. AND IT DOESN'T. TO HAVE THEM FOR OUT OF HIM. EXPE BEST PRACTICES AND THERE IS BEST PRACTICES IN MY OPINION ARE THAT WE CAN DRAW UPON. THAT'S I STAY SO I AGAIN. PROUD TO BE CLOTH AND I. AM OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN WELL I AM HAPPY TO HEAR THAT SO MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE OUR KNOWLEDGE AND ALL OF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE STATE BEING SHUT DOWN- INTERPRETER TO THE CABIN NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND I HOPE THAT THAT MEANS THAT MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN ME IN MY EFFORTS. TO END A STATE OF EMERGENCY- AND THEN THE SHIP DOWN WITH THE C. R. NINETY THREE THAT BEING SAID- I DO HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. SO ASSEMBLY BILL ONE FOURTEEN OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DIRECTED THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION TO DEVELOP A NEW STRATEGIC PLAN FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS. THEY DEVELOP THIS PLAN BASED ON THE LATEST RESEARCH ON SUICIDE AND ITS PREVENTION- AND WITH INPUT AND GUIDANCE- EXCUSE ME WITH INPUT AND GUIDANCE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN AS WELL SO I AM. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS NEW. OFFICE IS GOING TO DO MORE THAN WHAT THE ORIGINAL ONE. DID IT JUST IT SEEMS DUPLICATIVE I I'M I'M WITH YOU ON DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN- TO PREVENT SUICIDE ABSOLUTELY I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT JUST IT SEEMS TO POCKET EVAN AND I COULD BE READING IT INCORRECTLY WOULD YOU. CARE TO COMMENT ON THAT ASSEMBLY DAUGHTER FIND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU A SENATOR MELENDEZ AM CERTAINLY IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- THERE'S A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT TOOK PLACE AND IT CAME OUT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS- DURING THAT TIME AND ONE OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS TO CREATE THIS OF THE OFFICE SUICIDE PREVENTION. SO COMING OUT OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT NOT IN FAILURE TO ACT ON THOSE IT AS FAR AS CREATING THIS OFFICE IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE SO MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST IN MY DISTRICT A SIXTH GRADER LOST HER LIFE DURING THE TIME. INDIAN RESERVATIONS 33% INCREASE WITHIN THE INDIAN PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S TIME THAT WE HAVE A STATEWIDE OFFICE OF THEN WE CAN COLLECT THAT DATA AND DOT BEEN TO THOSE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE SO DRASTICALLY. NEED THOSE RESOURCES BELIEVERS TODAY ABOUT GETS STILL WHAT WAS ALREADY STUDY AND CARING FOR THOSE RECOMMEND THE OUT OF THE STATE. HEY AND YOU. I READ REVELATIONS THE OF A CALIFORNIA I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THAT THEY WILL. HANDLE THIS PROPERLY BUT I'M WILLING TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE- AND THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING FOR ME THANK YOU CENTER. CENTER CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I TOO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I FULLY SUPPORTED. HAVING LOST A CLOSE FRIEND JUST LAST WEEK A SUICIDE. MY VIEW IS THAT RAISING THE VISIBILITY OF BOTH THE CRISIS AND THAT THERE ARE PATHWAYS SUPPORT IN REMEDIES WE CANNOT RAISE THAT VISIBILITY HIGH ENOUGH IN MY VIEW- AS CITED BY MY COLLEAGUE. THE RISE IN THE SUICIDE IS ALARMING A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND IF WE SAVE ONE LIFE IF WE SAVE FIVE LIVES IT IS WORTH THE PURSUIT. EVERY LIFE IS VALUABLE I TAKE IT. TO THE OPPONENT WHO SAW TO COMPARE THIS EFFORT. TO THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT WHICH WAS DESIGNED AS AN OPTION FOR PEOPLE WITH A TERMINAL ILLNESS. A LIFE ENDING ILLNESS ARE NOT SURE TO. THEY ARE ALREADY FACING DEATH SO I DON'T THINK IT'S A FAIR COMPARISON I FULLY SUPPORT THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN ALL THE ALLIES IN ORGANIZATIONS. WHO HAVE EMBRACED THIS PATHWAY AS A MEANS OF TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC OF SUICIDE. THAT IS EXACERBATED BY THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS I STRONGLY URGE AND I VOTE THINKING.

IT DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH BUT I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF TIME I'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT. YOU KNOW. WHY I AM SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S REASON BEHIND IT AND IT'S A MAJOR MAJOR ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT BUT I PERSONALLY COME ACROSS IT IN MY HOMETOWN. EARLIERTHIS YEAR AS WELL WITH A LOVED ONE IN MY FAMILY. AND I JUST YOU KNOW THINK THAT WHATEVER IT TAKES WHATEVER IT TAKES WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PREVENT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY INCREASING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH CONVEYED.

SHOULD PROPOSED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BEGINNING IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR THE RATE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. HELLO WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR DELAYING THE NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS LAID OUT IN THE BILL. THE TWENTY POINT THREE. WE ARE STILL CONCERNED THAT THE REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THE BILL MUST BE IMPLEMENTED SOONER IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THERE ARE VARIOUS FACTORS AND CONSIDERATIONS THAT GO TO THE RATE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. AND MANY OF THESE FACTORS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER OR IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT ENDEMIC. I WHICH MAKES OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE MISSION DATA PART OF THE JOB CHALLENGING HEALTH. INSURERS DIFFERENTLY THESE CHALLENGES FROM ALL AROUND THE FACT THAT HEALTH PLAN RATE FILINGS ARE DONE PROSPECTIVELY.% HELP PLAN WILL BEGIN PREPARING THE REDEVELOPMENT. PROCESS FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO RATE THAT ALL. AND YET ARE STILL ESTIMATING. THE TRUE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC WILL HAVE ON FUTURERATE. I WE BELIEVE THAT THE FULL REPERCUSSIONS OF THE PANDEMIC ON HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY REALIZED AS OF YET. CONSIDERING THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THAT TWENTY TWENTY THREE IMPLEMENTATION DATE FOR THE ENTIRE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. WOULD ALLOW ALL STAKEHOLDERS THE NECESSARY. TIME TO ASSESS THE IMPACT.

MUMBAI ON HIS BACKUP ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS. AB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR REPRESENTS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO CONTAIN SKYROCKETING HEALTH CARE COSTS. EMPLOYERS THAT PROVIDE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES STRUGGLE TO CONTAIN COSTS AND OBTAIN THE BEST QUALITY OF CARE. THIS BILL PROVIDE TWO PILOTS ONE INCIDENT IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE STATE. ANOTHER THE NORTHERN SECTION. OF THE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE PILOTS WOULD INCLUDE RESTORING PROVIDERS THERE A MANTRA FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE FOR FINANCIAL SOLVENCY AND OPERATIONS. SELF FUNDED EMPLOYER PLANS WOULD USE RISK BASED AUDIT RISK BASED OR CAPITATED PAYMENT MECHANISMS WITH THE HELP PROVIDERS FOR THEIR SERVICES. RATHER THAN PURE BE FOR SERVERS BONTA STATION. AT THE END OF THE PERIOD THE PARTICIPANTS REPORT ON THE OUTCOMES OF THE TWO PILOTS TO INFORM LEGISLATURE ON PROMISING BULLS. OF CARE SING AND DELIVERY. A STUDY BY THE UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PREDICTED THAT THIS TYPE OF BOTTLE COULD REDUCE HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES BY AN ESTIMATED A HUNDRED TEN BILLION DOLLARS. OVER TEN YEARS. THE PROVIDES FOR CONSUMERS. THE BILL LAZOR A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION COMPONENTS SUCH AS ACCESS TO SPECIALIST PRESCRIPTION BENEFITS AND A COMPLAINTS PROCESS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE CONTRACTING PROCESS. FOR THE PILOT PROGRAMS IS ALSO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TRANSPARENCY AND A WHOLE LOT OF REPORTING- THAT WOULD E REQUIRED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE ALTHOUGH THIS IS A MY BILL ACTUALLY LIKE IT A LOT. SO I THINK IT DOES ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TRY SOMETHING NEW AND INNOVATIVE IN OTHER IN THE REALM OF SKYROCKETING HEALTH CARE COSTS COMBATTING UNSTABLE HEALTHCARE COSTS. REQUIRES NEW WAYS OF THINKING AT LEAST PART OF PROGRESS CAN HELP US DETERMINATION METHODS OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY.

BY DOZENS BY ALLOWING RESTRICTED LICENSE FEES TO ACTUALLY HEALTH PLANS BUT WITHOUT THE SAME KNOCKING REQUIREMENTS ARE FULLY LICENSED PLANS FOR FINANCIAL SOLVENCY DELEGATION OVERSIGHT QUALITY. CLAIMS PROCESSING OTHER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. WHILE THE REEDS BASED PROVIDER ENTITIES THAT CAN OPERATE UNDER THESE PILOT PROGRAMS CURRENTLY COMPLY WITH SOME FINANCIAL SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS THE LOCATIONS ARE NOT AS HIGH AS THOSE FOR FULLY LICENSED HEALTH PLANS. THE KEY ISSUE A MEASURE COMEDIAN ALEX IS A DEFINITELY POINTS OUT FINANCIAL STANDARDS HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN PUT IN PLACE BECAUSE OF A HISTORY. OF METER PROVIDER GROUP CONSULTANCIES. WITHOUT A LICENSE FULL SERVICE HEALTH PLAN INVOLVED IN THE ARRANGEMENT. AND SHOULD ANY OF THESE NEWLY ESTABLISHED ENTITIES BECOMING COLD AND ARE THE ONES WHO WOULD ACTUALLY BE HARMED BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE NO ENTITY TO PAY THEIR CLAIMS OR- PROVIDE CARE TO THE MEMBERS. GENERALLY SPEAKING WITHOUT A SPONSORED PLAN INVOLVED PROPOSED HIGHLY. WOULD SIDESTEP THE IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS GUARANTEED IN THE KNOX KEEN ACT- TO ROWLEY THAT ALL LICENSED HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS WHICH WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT THIS BILL WAS VETOED LAST YEAR. SO THIS STORY IS TOO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AT THE WRONG TIME. IT'S A BIG AND IS ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR BILL WAS. DEBATED IN VETO LAST YEAR. BOB FOR THIS ISSUE TO SUDDENLY MATERIALIZED AGAIN IN THE FINAL THREE WEEKS SESSION IS QUESTIONABLE FRO A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE. AND DOES NOT GIVE US AMPLE TIME TO CONSIDER THE RISKS TO CONSUMERS.

AS WE HAVE ALL SEEN HOME FOOD DELIVERIES HAVE ROCKETED US RESTAURANTS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SHUT DOWN. AND THE PUBLIC WAS ORDERED TO SHELTER IN PLACE. HOWEVER READY TO EAT FOOD DELIVERIES HAVE ENABLED MANY RESTAURANTS. MANY IN MY COMMUNITY TO REMAIN OPEN FOR BUSINESS DURING THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME MAKING IT PROBABLY THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO STAY. IN BUSINESS AB THREE AT THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX WILL ENHANCE FOOD SAFETY ACROSS THE STATE WHICH IS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL AT THIS TIME. IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS ISSUES RAISED BY THE OPPONENTS I HAVE POSTMAN'S TO REQUIRED TO BE MAINTAINED. AT THE HOLDING AT THE HOLY RETURN US TO PREVENT SPOILAGE. SPECIFY THE FOOD FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO CLOSE THE BAG OR THE CONTAINER WITH THE TAMPERED EVIDENCE. SEVERED AND OTHER CLARIFY CHANGE. READY TO EAT DELIVERY DRIVERS AND RESTAURANT WORKERS HAVE BECOME ESSENTIAL WORKERS SUMMIT COVERT NINETEEN. AND WESTERN ALLIES EVERY DAY TO FEED CALIFORNIANS. THESE WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL NOT SACRIFICIAL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH BY ENSURING THAT READY TO EAT FOOD IS NOT TAMPERED WITH.

BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE FDA GUIDANCE AS TO HOW TO PREVENT SPOILAGE AND THEN FINALLY- THE NEW YORKER MENTIONED THIS ONE OF THE OTHER POINTS RAISED BY A TECHNICIAN OTHERS IS THAT THIS BILL IS INTENDED. TO PROVIDE SOME CLARITY OF EXISTING LITTLE WHAT I'LL THIS BILL THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WILL HAVE TO RELY ON CHILDHOOD IN ITS CURRENT FORM AND COLOR CODED CAL CURRENT FORM IS READY WRITTEN.

SHARE AND MEMBERS GET RECOGNITION WOULD. WE SHARE THE AUTHORS GOAL OF ENSURING THE SAFE DELIVERY OF STUDENTS I BELIEVE THE REQUIREMENT OF A TAMPER EVIDENT BAGS HELPS ADDRESSES BUT UNFORTUNATELY TECH NOT REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED TO EIGHTY THREE THREE THREE SIX. HE HAS WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR JIM COULD BE ADVOCATES YET THIS BILL BUT WE STILL HAVE AN OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT REMAIN WE HAVE AUTHORED AMENDMENTS OVER A. OVER A MONTH AGO AND WE FEEL. EITHER REASONABLE COMP AND STICK IT AT. AND THE INTENT OF BILL. PLEASE CLARIFICATION DELTA'S TO DELIVERY REST BUT THE MAJOR SURE THAT. RUSSIAN ARE DOWN. IN GROCERY STORE OPEN UP AND OF GOVERNMENTS. ALSO CONCERNS I NEED REQUIRED OF THE BILL I THINK THAT SECTION. ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN NINE NINE SIX OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE WHICH ESTABLISHES THE THIRTY MINUTE DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS. WE BELIEVE THIS SECTION OF CODE IS MORE APPLICABILITY COMMERCIAL TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED TRANSPORTATION. THAT SECTION OF CODES. REFERENCING THE TRANSPORTATION OF RAW SHELL EGGS AND I'M SHOCKED AND LYFT MOLLUSCAN SHELLFISH RATHER THAN TEMPER TEMPERAMENT AND FUTURE BAG OF CHICKEN TENDERS AND FRENCH FRIES. WE HAVE PROPOSED AN ALTERNATIVE AMENDMENT THAT IS ALSO IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE CHANGE INDUSTRY WHICH IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY CLASS. I MEMBERS ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING CUSTOMERS UNHAPPY. FOR PROVIDING THEM WITH FOOD THAT IS NO LONGER SAFE WE OPERATE IN A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT ENSURING RELIABLE AND SAFE FOOD IS PARAMOUNT TO OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN SATISFIED. CUSTOMERS MOST OF MY RIDER UNDER THIRTY MINUTES BUT THERE MAY BE CASES WHERE DELIVER HAS A LONGER DELIVERY DRIVER. PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS THE REQUIREMENT OF THIS BILL COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD US NOT DELIVERING TO THESE AREAS. OF CONCERN OF NON COMPLIANCE WHICH IS AN AREA CODE IT BECOMES. PARTICULARLY TENUOUS. POSITION THERE IS A NEW AUTHOR AMENDMENT THAT REFERENCES THAT THE FOOD SHALL BE MAINTAINED AT. HOLDING TEMPERATURE NECESSARY TO PREVENT SPOILAGE MINISTERING BUT WHAT IS YOUR NAME AND INTERLINK ENFORCEMENT EDUCATION. IS DISCOUNTED TO THE PREVIOUSLY REFERENCE SECTION WHAT TEMPERATURE DOES THIS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND TIGHT YOU KNOW I WANT TO THINK THAT THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FLORIDA BUT I ALSO EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS- UNFORTUNATELY WE ALL KNOW HOW CONDENSED THIS SESSION HAS BEEN AT IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING THIS BILL AND YOU KNOW AS A LAST WEEK IT CAME UP AND- YOU KNOW I PRIDE MYSELF IN REALLY DOING. MY DUE DILIGENCE AND REALLY HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO A TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND REALLY DELVE DEEP INTO JUST INFORMATION AND CAN I SET OUT TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND- AND IT'S NOT YOU KNOW OF COURSE IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT. CONCEPT DURING COOLEY NINETEEN THAT WE PROTECT CONSUMERS AND THAT WE ARE VERY MINDFUL OF TRANSMISSION AND ALL THE ISSUES THAT COME WITH IT TO BUT I WAS TRYING TO FIND. DATA BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE OF BILLS PRIOR TOCOVER NINETEEN AND- AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THERE'S ANY INFORMATION OUT THERE THAT CAN HELP WITHOUT. SOME DATA THAT SHOWS HEALTH PROBLEMS FROM THESE TYPE OF DELIVERY SERVICES AGAIN IN TERMS OF JUST UNDERSTANDING THE BIGGER PICTURE AND DIE HAVE CONCERNS ALL FILLED WITH SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES AND I'M NOT. GONNA BILLS AS A UNTIL LIKE THE GROCERIES ASSOCIATION ANOTHER. BUSINESS WE CAN BUT MY LITTLE BIT TO CONSTANTLY ARPINO WITH ME EVERY. TO CHECK UP LET HIM BREATHE A LITTLE FEEL THERE'S MUCH CA THEIR WAY AND THESE ARE COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO. TO TAKE A PAUSE AND RE ROUTE AND REDO THINGS RIGHT NOW THEY'RE JUST IN SURVIVAL MODE AND DA. NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW IT WORKS- QUITE FRANKLY I'VE HAD VERY LITTLE TIME TO EXPLORE THIS ISSUE GIVE ME A LITTLE PAUSE AGAIN I'M NOT THINKING OF THE BIG COMPANIES THAT I KNOW OKAY HANDS BUT IT'S LITTLE BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT WHO ARE REPEATING FOR SUPPORT AND HELP. RESURFACES HAVE BEEN THE ONLY LEAD WHEN THEY'VE LOST. OFTEN AND I AND I KNOW WE SHARE SIMILAR. THE AUTHOR I AND SO I CLEARED UNDER. HOW I IS BUT I WANT TO JUST ALSO SAY I WILL SUPPORT IT WITH RESERVATIONS AND I REALLY WANT TO. YOU KNOW. GET MORE INFORMATION ON THIS AND EXPLORE IT FURTHER AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I STATED BILLS CONCERNS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MONEY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND ALSO TO APPLIED. HER WORK TO SIX SUPPORT OF THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION ALONG WITH ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS. CLEARLY THE SELF INTEREST OF RESTAURANTS WHO TAKE PRECAUTIONS AS WAS STATED FROM THE- DELIVERY OF FOOD TO THEIR STAFF ASSESSMENTS TO THE PREPARATION. AND NOW SENDING OUT. THEIR PRIORITY IS PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF THEIR CUSTOMERS BUT ALSO THEY HAVE A SELF INTEREST IN BEING PROTECTED AGAINST POTENTIAL LIABILITY- SO THAT SWING THAT CHAIN OF DELIVERY. HAVING CERTAIN PROTOCOLS THAT ARE FOLLOWED IT ACTUALLY PROTECTS EVERYBODY FIRST AND FOREMOST THE CONSUMER. THE RESTAURANT OWNER AND EVEN THE DELIVERY SERVICE SO- I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY AND WOULD BE WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU CELEBRATION FROM CENTER MINING ARE THERE ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OKAY SAYING NINE. SUMMER I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND- SOMEONE WITH A BACKGROUND PUBLIC HEALTH I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL TO ENSURE THAT WE KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. OFTENTIMES PEOPLE TAKE FOOD SAFETY FOR GRANTED AND- I APPRECIATE THE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE TECH COMMUNITIES BROUGHT UP BUT- I ALSO WANTED. YOU'LL BE SURE THAT WE KEEP THE FOOD SAFETY CAN EXPECT CUSTOMERS TO SIT AND TRY TO TRACK HOW LONG IT'S BEEN BETWEEN THE TIME THE RIGHT NOW WHATEVER YOU'RE PICKING IT UP UNTIL IT DRIVES THE CUSTOMERS. WE NOW THAT ACTUALLY THE CC MAKES NOTE THAT ROUGHLY ONE IN SIX AMERICANS. GET FOOD POISONING EACH YEAR. AND ACTUALLY THREE THOUSAND DIE EACH YEAR OF FOOD BORNE DISEASES. CERTAINLY I DON'T YEP I KNOW THAT NO ONE. WANTS THAT TO HAPPEN OR EVEN INTENDS THAT TO HAPPEN WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD DELIVERY. THERE'S A REASON WE HAVE FOOD STANDARDS AND IN FACT IT'S OUR ENVIRONMENTAL. HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT WHEN WE GO EAT WHETHER WE GET DELIVERY OR GO TO A RESTAURANT THAT- WE ARE SAFE. AND IT'S A HARD JOB BY THE WAY IT'S NOT EASY AT THAT THE REASON THAT STILL WE STILL HAVE THE NUMBERS I JUST CITED IS BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT AND- BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE SAFE AND THAT. THERE'S ACOSTA GETTING SIX TWO YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S LOST WAGES ARE HEALTHCARE COSTS OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. AND SO WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO KEEP FOOD SAFE YOU OBVIOUSLY WANT. REASONABLE REGULATIONS ARE WORKABLE AND I APPRECIATE SOME NUMBER THAT YOU HAVE WORK TO MOVE THE BILL IN THAT DIRECTION. BUT AS A- THAT YOU HAVE SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH HANDLING FOOD OR SPONSORING FOOD IS SAFE. AND WITH THAT I CERTAINLY IN SUPPORT. OF THE BILL WHICH I LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR POSSIBLE I'D LIKE TO ONE OF THE- WITNESSES. OF TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME THE TECH.

PROVISIONING TRANSPORTATION WAS WRITTEN OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO HE DID NOT CLOSE. THE CHECK IN THIS CODE. PERSONAL CALL USE DELIVERY. AND ON THAT POINT WE CHANGED THE TOO MANY IT JENNIFER TO BE CLEAN AND OF THE I DO NOT BELIEVE THE HELP CAN WOULD ALLOW PROVISIONS BECAUSE THE NET. SECONDLY THE REASON WE NOT TAKE OKAY NOT PROPOSED TO DEAL THAT TO TAKE THE- CHECK. OPPOSE ABOUT CHANGE THE DATE. WITH RESPECT IT'S THE MY OKAY THERE ARE DELIVERY SERVICE THAT MAY NOT HVE AN ACTING. DELIVERY SERVICE PEOPLE BY OF THAT OWN CAR. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE TWO SERVICE WHETHER IT'S ACTING ON OUR. OPEN TO TAKING AMENDMENT TO WOULD ALLOW YEAH THE FACE PLATFORM BUT WE ARE IN IN OLDER. WHETHER THEY'RE ON ON. TAKEN A OPEN IN THE JUST TO BE CLEAR. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS EASY TO COMPLY WITH. ABOUT IT MONTH AGO HEARD THAT THE PREVIOUS LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. WHICH SAYS THE DEALER MISTAKES HAVE TO REQUIRE CAMBRIDGE. THERE WAS A COMPLAINT THE DEVIL TO THAT TO FOR. SO WE SIMPLY SAY IT IS THE- OF THE DELIVER CHAU OF THE FOOD THAT COMES. DURING THE TIME. HEY HEY TO DELIVER THE FOOD FROM THE RETAIL FOOD. THE CARD ENDING ADEQUATE GUIDANCE IF YOU. WHICH TOOK ABOUT TEMPERATURE COULD.

TO PROVIDE LIVE THE DEEPER TO THE FACILITIES NOT ANY. AND WE HAVE TAKEN OUT. WRITTEN OUT OF THE BILL GROCERY DELIVERY SO THIS IS A RARE TO EAT FROM WHATEVER FOOD. IS TO BE FOR NEEDS TO BE DONE I WAITING A WEEK THINK OF US BILL. CLINTON CURRENTLY ECONOMY OF ONE MORE RIGHT NOW OF THE TIME OF IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY YOU BEFORE HAVE TO SEND CLOSE GIVEN THAT STATEMENT TODAY OTHER ARE. SAYING ASSEMBLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO FINISH PLEASE. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO MY WITNESSES- IN SUPPORT AND ALSO TO THE OPPOSITION FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE. AND TO THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT AND FIRST LET ME JUST SAY. THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY INTERESTING EXPERIENCE TERMS OF TRYING TO COME TOGETHER WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ONLY TO HAVE MORE CONCERNS PLACED ON TOP OF THOSE CONCERNS. ONCE THOSE CONCERNS ARE ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT TO ME SEEMS LIKE A AN UNFAIR WAY TO DO BUSINESS AND TRY TO PASS LEGISLATION AMID COBIT. THAT ACTUALLY AIMS TO HELP PEOPLE ARE NOT A CONTACT AND NOT CONTRACT THE DISEASE. AT THE TO THE ISSUES OF A SMALL BUSINESSES. THIS ACTUALLY IS A IS A BILL THAT PROTECTS SMALL BUSINESSES THE REALITY IS. THAT LOOK I USE. THE THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS TO GET FOOD DELIVERED FROM RESTAURANTS- AND I HAVE IN THE PAST YOU SEE BAGS DIED FROM A FAST FOOD JOINT. THAT WERE OPENED THAT WERE NOT. IN A CONVERSATION WITH MEMBERS AND TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE HAVE ALL SET I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT TOO IN FACT I ORDERED. A BURGER WITH SOME FRIES ONLY TO NOTICE THAT YOU KNOW MORE THAN HALF MY PRICE OR EVEN. AND YOU BEGIN TO THINK. WELL THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL GET INTO YOUR FOOD THAT THEY EAT THEIR FOOD OR THEIR HANDS CLEANED AT CETERA. THERE WAS ONE SITUATION IN A STORY THAT WAS SHARED WITH ME WHICH- HE- NOW TO. PERSON DELIVER THE FOOD AND THAT THEY- BAGS AND BAGS OF CLOTHES IN THE CAR. WHICH. AND THE END OF IT BELIEVE THE FIRST PERHAPS. AND THAT THE MONEY THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING A JUSTIN. TO PAY FOR THE CELL PHONE THERE WERE USING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE PART TIME JOB MEANING CAN YOU. THE FIVE IN TO AN END OF THAT IS HOMELESS THAT IS DELIVERING FOOD AND THAT IS ALSO HUNGRY. THAT IS A WHOLE OTHER CONVERSATION THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH WITH THE TYPE OF REALITY THE CALIFORNIA FACES. BUT AMID COLD IT. WHAT IS THE WHATARE THE CHANCES THAT YOUR FOOD MAY BE CONTAMINATED IF IT IS NOT SEALED. WITH THIS BILL I'VE SPOKEN TO A LOT OF MY SMALL RESTAURANTS TO ANSWER SENATOR RUBIO'S POINT ABOUT YOUR SMALL BUSINESSES. WHEN YOU ORDER FOOD THROUGH A PLATFORM AND THE CUSTOMER IS NOT SATISFIED THEY DON'T GO ONLINE AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PLATFORM. THE GO TO YELP AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RESTAURANT. AND THE RESTAURANT HAS NO IMPACT TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT FOOD IS DELIVERED AND THE AND THE INDIVIDUAL THAT HURTS THE MOST IS THAT RESTAURANT BECAUSE THE FOOD HASN'T BEEN SEALED OR DOESN'T HAVE A SOME KIND OF FIELD. TO AVOID ANY ISSUES IN THE RESTAURANT IN MY COMMUNITY AND MY DISTRICT THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO. THEY LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING IN CONTROL. OF PREPARING THE FOOD PUTTING THE FOOD IN A CONTAINER IN THE BACK SEALING IT WITH A STICKER OR WITH STAPLES. AND THEN HANDING IT OFF TO SOMEONE ELSE TO BE DELIVERED THAT ENSURES THAT THAT FOOD IS NOT CONTAMINATED IT IS NOT TAMPERED WITH AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO RECEIVES IT. RECEIVE THE FOOD THAT THERE ARE INTENDED TO RECEIVE THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL- IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT- VEHICLES ARE CLEAN. AND CLEANABLE TO THE EXAMPLE THAT I JUST GAVE YOU WE HAD ORIGINALLY INCLUDED HOT FOODS FROM GROCERY STORES I LOVE A GOOD ROTISSERIE CHICKEN WHO DOESN'T RIGHT. AND THE- AND THAT IS AVAILABLE AT THE GROCERY STORE. WHERE YOU CAN ALSO BUY OTHER TYPES OF FOOD. NOW IT GETS COMPLICATED WHEN YOU ORDER. OF HOT FOOD LIKE A ROTISSERIE CHICKEN OR A SANDWICH FROM THE DELI INSIDE A GROCERY STORE. SAID YOU KNOW WHAT OKAY MAYBE THAT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED LET'S LOOK AT THAT LATER AND WE EXTENDED IT. SO TO CONTINUE T SAY THAT. OUR GROCERIES ARE IMPACTED THAT IS COMPLETELY. ARE NOT TRUE WE HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD TO MAKE THIS BILL BE APPROPRIATE BILL NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS THE CALIFORNIA STANDARD. NOT A LOCAL JURISDICTION BUT A CALIFORNIA STANDARD FOR DELIVERY OF SAFE FOOD SO THAT IF YOU ARE HOME. IF YOU ARE A SOMEONE THAT IS A POTENTIALLY COULD BE IMPACTED BY COLD IT BECAUSE OF YOUR AGE. OR OTHER TYPES OF SCENARIOS AND IF YOU HAVE YOUR FOOD DELIVERED. THEY USED TO GET THE BEST SAFEST WHO DELIVERED. TO YOUR HOME THAT THE RESTAURANTS- MAINTAIN THE QUALITY THAT THEY INTENDED TO. AND THAT THE PERSON DELIVERING THE FOOD CONTINUES TO HAVE A JOB AMID THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS THE INTENT OF THE BILL THAT IS WHY WE WORK ON IT SO HARD. THAT IS WHY IT'S MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST ARRIVAL. THANK VERY MUCH THAT. THIS IS A THIRTY THIRTY SO THE MOTION I THINK WAS IT WAS IT MADE BY CENTER YES CENTER MINING TO MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HAN HI CAN I GONZALEZ HI SALAS I GROW FURTADO. I TOTAL AYE LEYVA HI. DAVE I AM MELENDEZ NO. MELINDA'S NO MITCHELL. HI MITCHELL AYE MONNING AYE MONNING AYE RUBIO. RUBIO I.

THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME THE HONOR SPEAKING TODAY. MY NAME IS LAURA PERRY I'M A FORMER TRANSGENDER. AND I REPRESENT THOUSANDS WHO'VE CONTACTED ME AND MINISTRIES LIKE MINE. WHO REGRET TRANSITION. BUT UNLIKE TRYING A CAREER OR NEEDS FOR TRANSGENDERISM AS PERMANENT LIFE ALTERING CONSEQUENCES. MANY OF WHICH CANNOT BE UNDONE. THE PROBLEM IS IN THE MIND NOT THE BODY. IN MOST CASES TRANSGENDERISM IS BIRTH OUT OF REJECTION OR OTHER EMOTIONAL WOUNDS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I WAS ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED OF THE MAN. AND BEGAN TAKING TESTOSTERONE I HAD TWO MAJOR SURGERIES INCLUDING A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. AND AT ALL FEMALE WORKERS ARE. THE FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS EVERYTHING I'D EVER WANTED. WAS NOW LEGALLY MAILING OUT JOB WHERE I WAS ONLY KNOWN AS MALE. BUT INITIALLY I BECAME MORE AND MORE DEPRESSED. I FOUND WHAT THOUSANDS OF OTHERS HAVE THE TRANSITION ISN'T REAL. NOT ONLY WAS THE TRANSITION NOT REAL. BUT IT DID NOT RESOLVE THE PAIN IN THE UNDERLYING ISSUES I REALIZE ONE DAY BEFORE. THAT IT WAS NEVER GOING TO BE A MAN. BUT IT WAS TOO PAINFUL TO FACE BEING A WOMAN. I GRAPPLED WITH THE SAME THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE THAT MANY DO AFTER SURGERY. IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT YOU WERE IN MY SHOES HAVING PERMANENTLY ALTERED YOUR BODY. AND REALIZING THAT YOU HAD BEEN DUPED. BUT THANKFULLY FTER NINE YEARS OF LIVING IS TRANSGENDER I WAS RESCUED FROM THE HELL. I SHOULD BE DEAD I CONSIDER TAKING MY LIFE. BUT INSTEAD OUR CREATOR AND MY LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST RESCUED ME. HE TOLD ME TO LEAVE IT ALL THE- AND FOLLOW. BECAUSE IT FIFTY TELLS US THAT HE WAS SENT TO BIND UP THE BROKEN HEARTED. AND THAT IS WHAT HE DID. HIS COMPLETELY HEALED ME AND SET ME. NOTED TO GO BACK NO DINNER JUST FOR. FIVE BECOME SO FOR. BELIEVE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ARE EVER TO. BUT I CAN'T GUARANTEE I WAS. I IMPLORE YOU TO VOTE NO AB. AB. TWO LISTEN CHILDREN EVEN I EVEN TOLD HER HER. TO PER. MAY THEIR BODIES IN THIS. WHO COUNTS ANOTHER THING. OF MANY GO ON TO LIVE. PRODUCTIVE LIFE. WITHOUT TRANSIT. CURRENT AND OR AND- ABLE TO EMBRACE THE RIGHT IN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO- DR CLINTON VAN METER- AND YOU HAVE BECAUSE TWO MINUTES AND TWO SECONDS. THE DOCTOR. IT ACROSS IS BOARD CERTIFIED OF FORTY YEARS BROWN PRACTICE I GO ALL THE WAY BACK IN MY TRAINING YOUR TO THE INCEPTION- OF pTRANSSEXUALS IN THE TIME AT- TREATED AT JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL- THE CONCEPT IS IDEOLOGY NOT BASED ON SCIENCE AND BECAUSE OF THAT JOHNS HOPKINS I STOPPED THE PROGRAM IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND INDICATED THEY WOULD NOT CONTINUE BECAUSE IT LACKS SCIENCE AND WAS BASICALLY AN IDEA. AND GENDER HAS NO BIOLOGIC BASIS IS OF AT THE STATE OF MIND THIRTEEN OF THIRTEEN PUBLISHED STUDIES SHOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY A MINIMUM OF SIXTY MAXIMUM 98% OF TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS WITH APPROPRIATE CONSISTENT CONSTANT COUNSELING THEY JUST FROM THERE DISSOCIATION OF BIOLOGICAL SEX AND GENDER BY THE END OF THEIR ADOLESCENCE THIS IS A NATURAL PROCESS WHICH IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY PURITY AND PURITY DOES NOT NEED TO BE BLOCKED. NOT IN THE CITY'S PARKING IT IS NOT A CAUSE YEAH ALLOWING THE CHILD TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE GENDER DYSPHORIA AND WISH TO CONTINUE IT IS THEY GOT CONVAIR VALVES TO GO RIGHT INTO MEDICAL TREATMENT WITH CROSS SEX HORMONES AND SUBSEQUENT SURGERY ALL OF WHICH I DO NOT CHANGE THE PERSON ABOUT KAMALA FEMALE OR VICE VERSA. IS THE APPEARANCE AND THE COST WHICH NOT THEM IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE DOUBLE THE SIZE. OF BEEN DISPROVEN BY. STEADY AND JOURNAL AMERICANS LIKE HIGH. WHICH SHOWS THAT NOT ONLY MEDICAL. TREATMENT NOT BRING ABOUT THAT MENTAL IN THE TRANSGENDER POPULATION BUT SURGICAL INTERVENTION ALSO DID NOT THE IS. LAST WEEK. BY THAT JOURNAL AND IT IMPROVES IN THE CURRENT STUDY THAT ALL OF THE MYTH OF TRANSGENDERISM BEING NECESSARY TO TRANSITION- SOCIALLY MEDICALLY AND SURGICALLY BRING ABOUT BETTER MENTAL HEALTH. WHAT I'M ASKING THIS COMMITTEE IS JUST NOT THERE TO TABLE THIS BILL AND BRING TOGETHER IN THE SAME ROOM FACE TO FACE. PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND LISTEN TO FINANCE WE ARE NOT LISTENING TO SCIENCE WE HEAR OF PEOPLE CALLING IN TODAY WE'RE LISTENING TO MOTIONS ALL OF WHICH ARE PASSIONATE.

SET THOSE ARE PAUL I DECIDED TO INCREASE THE BILL VERY CAREFULLY AND I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING ABOUT STERILIZING CHILDREN BUT WHAT IT DID SAY VERY CLEARLY THAT IT WILL PROVIDE GRANTS TO TRANSLATE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE MORE INCLUSIVE SERVICE AND THAT MEANS EVERYTHING FROM HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES TO ASSIST. AND A LOT AND SO I WAS VERY EAGER TO READ THE BILL AND HAS. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT SAYS WE'RE STERILIZING CHILDREN SO WITH THAT I ALSO FOUGHT PASSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. OKAY CENTER TADO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW AT. I RECEIVED MANY MANY CALLS- IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL FROM MY DISTRICT- BUT- YOU KNOW I STRONGLY FEEL THAT THERE'S AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE BEING MISLED EXACTLY ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL MEANS AND WHAT IT IS.

THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD. TEAM LEYVA IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANYONE ELSE ON THIS FLOOR WE RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF CALLS. ABOUT TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. AND I JUST FEEL BAD FOR THE- WHO WERE CAUGHT TO. US TO VOTE NO BECAUSE I DO THINK THEY WERE MISLED. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT TALKS ABOUT STERILIZING CHILDREN. IT REALLY TALKS ABOUT HEALTH. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFY AS TRANS GENDER. NON CONFORMING OR INTERSEX AND I JUST FILL UP THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION MAYBE DIDN'THAVE. THE FACTS. OR MAYBE THEY DID AND THEY JUST WERE CALLING TO TRY AND GET US TO VOTE NO BUT I'M HAVE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. AGAIN THANK AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR ANY OTHERQUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS YES CENTER MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR IF I MAY YES. SO IT THE BILL LET'S SEE HERE ALLOWS FOR MEDICAL THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND FUNDING- THAT PROVIDE GENDER CONFORMING HEALTH CARE SERVICES CAN YOU TELL US. CAN YOU GIVE US A LIST OF WHAT GENDER CONFORMING HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE. SOME NUMBER. OF GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT COULD BE IT COULD BE ADVISED ON HORMONES AND THEREFORE HE WOULD NEED SPECIAL TRAINING. ARE FOR THATAND THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL INTENDS TO DO. IT WOULD PROVIDE TRAINING FOR THEM THAT. COULD WELL BE THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN IN THERE WOULD BE NONPROFIT TO HAVE TO APPLY FOR THE DOLLARS ARE WHO COULD WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH CLINICS AND OR HOSPITALS. OR AMONGST THEMSELVES. SORRY TO THE CHAIR- OKAY SO- ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE FUNDING COULD GO TOWARDS TRAINING HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ON. HORMONE THERAPY DINER STANEK CORRECTLY. IF YOU WISH TO ANSWER SOME NUMBER OF LIQUOR HYPOTHETICALLY YES. OKAY SO I JUST.BECAUSE THEY'RE BEEN COMMENTS SUGGESTING THAT IT IT THE BILL WOULD NOT ALLOW FOR THAT BUT IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH IT WOULD- NOT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING THAT THE FUNDING TO GO TOWARD BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OCCURRED. THAT COULD GO TOWARD SAID THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING. SINCE OUR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. A SENTIMENTAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND I. RECEIVE AT LEAST ONE POSITIVE ELEMENT OF OUR CURRENT WAY OF DOING BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF CALL OF IT IS THE OPPORTUNITY PEOPLE HAVE TO CALL IN VERSUS YOU KNOW COME IN IT COMING IN. TO THE ACTUAL CAPITAL YOU KNOW ONE THING LIKE MEANING YOU ARE GOT HUNDREDS OF CALLS BUT WE ACTUALLY DID THE ANALYSIS. VERY FEW OF THE MORE FROM MY ACTUAL DISTRICT AND SO ITHINK IT'S IN ALL HONESTY WILL WANT TO EXPRESS OUR OPINION YOU REACH OUT TO YOUR ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS AFTER YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR ELECTED OFFICIAL. WE GOT EIGHT HUNDRED CALLS IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE FIFTY OTHER MORE ACTUAL CONSTITUENTS- I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OKAY ST NINE- SO I WANT TO THANK YOU A SUMMER SANTIAGO FOR BRING THIS BILL FORD I. THINK JUSTICE- MANY OF. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOTED THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A TRANSGENDER WELLNESS IN EQUITY FUND. A FUND ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY- DATA HAS NOT BEEN FUND IN OUR BUDGET YET SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND SOME FUNDS IN THEIR- I WOULD MAKE A NOTE THAT- IS A PEDIATRICIAN MY OWN. SPECIAL SOCIETY THE AMERICAN CAVEAT TRIPS- CALIFORNIA HAS EXPRESSED SUPPORT. FOR THIS BILL AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE BILL HOPEFULLY WOULD FIND. TRAININGS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO PRACTICE THE STANDARD OF CARE. SANDERS CARE DOESN'T ESTABLISHED BY A BEFORE COLLEGE WILL AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD- THAT'S WHAT AMERICA CAN'T PEDIATRICS DOES AND I'M SURE OTHER SPECIALTY SOCIETIES AS WELL. BECAUSE AFTER ALL I MEAN WE WANT TO PROVIDE FUNDS TO SUPPORT HEALTH CARE WE WANTED FOR RIDE QUALITY HEALTHCARE BASED ON OUR BEST SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE. AND WITH THAT. I WANT TO I. THANK YOU FOR READING THIS BILL FOR ASK SOMEONE THANK OF MY CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE TESTIFIED INCLUDING- TO MY CONSTITUENCY WITHIN THE PEOPLE WHO SPOKE AND IN FAVOR OF THE BILL AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. BEING HERE FOR MAKING THAT TESTIMONY ON. APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING TO CUT ONE OF THE MONSTER I DO HAVE TO DISAPPEAR AFTER MEETING TIME WITH THAT SO THAT'S THAT'S PART OF MY JOB HERE. BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THE WONDERFUL WORK THE GENDER HEALTH CENTER DOES HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND APPRECIATE THEIR TESTIMONY HERE WHAT THAT. SOME NUMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE- THE COMMITTEES ROBUST DEBATE- AND ITS GENEROSITY WITH TIME IN THE- THE- OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE. THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT DURING COLD IT- UNFORTUNATELY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN- MISLED ABOUT THIS BILL WILL BE VERY CLEAR AND SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. NOTHING IN THIS BILL. NOTHING I WILL REPEAT. TALK ABOUT STERILIZING KIDS. NOTHING I WILL REPEAT IN THIS BILL. POINTS TO ANYTHING TO DO WITH CHILDREN. SALAI IN APPRECIATE THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT THAT SOME HAVE HAVE ENGAGED IN- I THINK THE DIMMEST LIGHT AND IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE. I THINK IT'S FEARMONGERING IN GOOD FOR SOUND BITES. BUT QUITE FRANKLY THEY'VE COME OUT OF GROUPS A IN FACT BOTH OPPOSITION WITNESSES ONE I BELIEVE WAS FROM OKLAHOMA AND THE OTHER FROM GEORGIA NOT TAKE AWAY FROM WHAT THEY BELIEVE ARE BUT IT'S BEEN UNFORTUNATE THAT IS BEEN FEAR MONGER IN USE FOR SOUND BITES THE BILL VERY CLEAR. EVERYBODY DOES IT WOULD ESTABLISH THE TRANS GENDER WELLNESS AND EQUITY FUND. I HOP ON A- IN THIS. TO JUST GRANT TO THE TRITONS GENDER LEVEL- OF NONPROFITS AND ORGANIZATIONS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES. FOR TJ PEOPLE. NOTHING LIKE WHAT'S BEEN SAID IN A VERY SIMPLE IT WOULD PROVIDE TRAINING FOR PRACTICES. TO NURSES AND DOCTORS. OUR ON TGI E. T. FRIDAY MASK CLIMATE. ISSUES ARE AND HOW TO BEST SERVE. BUT I WANT TO REPEAT THIS ONE MORE TIME IF IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED IT HERE NOTHING. IN THIS BILL. FIGMA SIGNIFIED ANY SORT OF ACTION TO ANY KID. OR STERILIZATION THE KIDS AND I THINK THIRTY COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WOULD REFLECTED THAT IF IT HAD BEEN THE TAKES AND IT'S NOT THE CASE. BUT NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS. THE GAUGE MET UNFORTUNATELY- THEY'VE BEEN MISLED. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK AN AYE VOTE.
