YEARS OF LIFE INSURANCE-

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.443
EXPERIENCE SO OUR ORGANIZATION

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.111
UNDERSTANDS BOTH THE CONSUMER

SB NINE TWENTY SEVEN IS NEEDED

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.360
COMPLICATED THAT NO CONSUMER CAN

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.362
UNDERSTAND THEM. CONSUMERS HAVE

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.364
NO CHOICE BUT TO TRUST THE

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.433

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:06.138
DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:08.841

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:15.247
THE BILL'S BEEN NARROWED SINCE

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:16.582
IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED SO

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.584
THAT IT NO LONGER REQUIRES

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:20.186
AGENTS TO ACT IN THE BEST

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:21.821

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:29.328
THE BILL REQUIRES TRANSPARENCY

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:31.797
ON SEVERAL KEY ISSUES INCLUDING

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:33.399

RECOMMENDED AND A I SEE MODEL.

00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:52.424
AS DRAFT TO BE A VERY STRONG

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:54.393
CONCERNS THE LANGUAGE WILL

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.995
CREATE AN IMPOSSIBLE COMPLIANCE

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:56.495
STANDARDS. WE HAVE ALSO

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:57.830
CONSISTENTLY CONVEYED TO THE

00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.798
AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE THAT WILL

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:00.432
SUPPORT ADDITIONAL PRODUCT

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:02.234
DISCLOSURES. HOWEVER SOME OF THE

00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:03.636
REQUIRED DISCLOSURES IN THE BILL

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:05.204
CONTINUE TO CONTAIN LANGUAGE

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:07.273
THAT IS FACTUALLY INACCURATE.

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.141
THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:09.742
DISCLOSURES OF PROPRIETY

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:12.578

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:15.381
THE SCOPE OF THEIR LICENSE OR-

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:18.350
WE BELIEVE THESE ISSUES CAN BE

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.551
SOLVED OR- AND WE HAVE PROVIDED

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:21.387
SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. BUT UNLESS

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:22.988
THESE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED WE

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:24.356
THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL CREATE

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:26.292
THE VERY THING THAT IT IS TRYING

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:28.360
TO FIX. CONFUSION FOR CONSUMERS

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.495

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:38.771
REVIEW REQUIREMENTS BY THE

COMMISSIONER AND SOME PRODUCTS

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:42.274
REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL. BEFORE

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:43.809
ENTERING THE MARKET PLACE. THIS

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:46.211
IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC SINCE

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.846
APPROVAL CAN TAKE MANY MONTHS.

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:49.248
AND IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:50.482

REVIEWED BY THE DEPARTMENT.

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.487
DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION WILL HELP

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:57.489
BUT IT IS NOT A PANACEA FOR THIS

00:15:57.556 --> 00:15:58.390

PREVIOUS ITERATIONS BUT WE

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:06.332
BELIEVE WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:08.400

RUBIO AND- MY THANKS TO THE- THE

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:24.470
SENATOR FROM PICO RIVERA I THINK

00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:26.538
HE WAS IDENTIFIED AN ISSUE THAT

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.540
HAS AS WORRIES AT WORRIED ME

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.476
BEFORE I WAS EVER IN THE SENATE

00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:31.477
I WAS LOOKING FOR LIFE INSURANCE

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:34.346
AND TRYING TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT-

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:36.548
AND- HIS FOCUS ON CONSUMERS IS

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:38.350
RIGHT ON THE MARK IN TERMS OF

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:40.919
MAKING SURE THAT. THEY'RE IN THE

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:42.087
POSITION TO MAKE THE BEST

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:43.822
JUDGMENT THAT THEY CAN- AND IT

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:46.325
IS VERY COMPLICATED IT'S VERY

00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:48.660
COMPLICATED ESPECIALLY WHEN-

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:50.896
PITCHES ARE MADE ABOUT TAX

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.198
CONSEQUENCES- THE ONE THING

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.367
THAT- CERTAINLY LEARNED IN LIFE

00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:56.835
IS THAT UNLESS IT'S YOUR

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:58.403
EXPERTISE A VERY CAREFUL ABOUT

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.771
EVER SERVING ANYTHING IN REGARD

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:01.974
TO THE LAW- AND CERTAINLY

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.811
ANYTHING THAT RELATES TO- TAXES-

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:06.478
BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLICATED PLACE

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:09.014
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:09.715
CONSULTING WITH THAT. I YOUR

00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:12.284
YOUR HARD IN THE RIGHT PLACE IN

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:13.085
REGARD TO THE BILL- A IN

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:16.588
PARTICULAR I THINK THAT THE- THE

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.690
- TAKE THE COMPONENT THAT GIVES

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:21.894
A CONSUMER THIRTY DAYS. TO

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.429
CANCEL TO CANCEL A POLICY IS IT

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:25.364
SEEMS TO ME OF A VERY

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.266
REASONABLE. STEP FORWARD TO

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:29.134
GIVE. SOMEONE THE CHANCE TO

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:31.103
REFLECT ON THAT CHOICE THAT

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:32.905
THEY'VE MADE WE KNOW HOW.

00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:33.605
CONSEQUENTIAL IT IS AND HOW LONG

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:36.708
LASTING IT CAN BE. AND I THINK

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:39.311
THAT'S CERTAINLY THE IMPORTANT

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:40.379
ELEMENT THAT I SEE IN THE

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:42.114
LEGISLATION. SOME OF THE OTHER

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.215
ELEMENTS MA'AM I'M STRUGGLING

00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:45.417
WITH I REALLY AM TRYING TO GET

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:49.388
MY HEAD AROUND- THE IDEA OF. I

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:51.423
AND ME TO SAY IT AS A RELATIVE

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.158
WHAT I'M GONNA SAY NEXT. YEAH

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:55.160
DISCLOSURES ARE GOOD. I

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:57.529
TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD. BUT THE IN

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:59.231
THE REAL WORLD THERE CAN BECOME

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:00.766
A SITUATION WHERE THE

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:01.733
DISCLOSURES ARE SO VAST THAT YOU

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.302
LOSE ANY IMPACT ON WHAT YOU

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:06.038
ACTUALLY WERE TRYING TO DO I

00:20:06.104 --> 00:20:06.638
GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES. WHEN I

SEVENTY FOUR PAGES OF

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:16.014
DISCLOSURES AND THEN THE REST

00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:18.016
THAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH AN

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:19.217
INITIAL AND SIGN. AND AT SOME

00:20:19.284 --> 00:20:22.154
POINT- YOU KNOW E. E. LOSE THE

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.222
IMPACT. AND I TALK ABOUT RENTING

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:25.223

OWNING A HOME AND ALL YOU HAVE

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:28.860

DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.486
CONFUSION IN THAT SPACE- IT'S

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:28.920
ALMOST LIKE. GOING INTO A

MCDONALD'S AND ORDERING AND

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:32.057
THEY'RE SAYING AND HERE'S THE

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.525
CHARGE YOU'RE SAYING WHAT I HAVE

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:35.360
TO PAY. I MEAN. IT'S JUST A PART

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:37.629
OF A LIFE THAT THAT SOMEONE IS A

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:38.597
SELLER AND A BUYER AND THEY'RE

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:40.165
BEING COMPENSATED SO. I'M

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:42.200
STRUGGLING IN THAT SPACE FOR WHY

00:21:42.267 --> 00:21:44.369
THAT DISCLOSURE IS SOMETHING OF

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:46.438
RELEVANCE. AND MEANING- WHETHER

00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:47.539
WE'RE PAYING THAT PERSON A

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:49.141
LITTLE BIT OR A LOT. IT JUST

00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:51.376
SEEMS LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT-

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:52.577
ANY AVERAGE CONSUMER IS NOT

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:53.979
GOING TO BE COMPLICATED NOT OVER

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:56.448
THEIR HEADS SO I'M HAVING SOME

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:57.449

SALESMANSHIP THAT DOES OCCUR-

00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:05.490

REMEDY IN THIS BILL SOLVES THAT

00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:09.428
PROBLEM. IN THE WAY THAT IS A

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:12.497
HEALTHY WAY TO SOLVE IT- AND I

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:14.866
FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE FEES

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:16.168

00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:21.039
AGAINST THE ACCOUNT OVER TIME

00:22:21.106 --> 00:22:22.307
IT'S ALMOST LIKE. WHETHER THAT'S

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:25.110
A HOMEOWNERS FEE- OR THE REST OF

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:26.678

DOLLARS A MONTH. AT THE LOW END.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.969

SIMPLY DO NOT THINK THAT THAT'S

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:27.143
TOO MUCH TO PAY- TO OPERATE A

WANTS TO- TO TAKE ACTION TO

00:52:59.175 --> 00:53:00.977
INCREASE COSTS BUT YOU KNOW

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:02.412

00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:05.715
WORLD TODAY AND- COSTS ARE GOING

UP EVERY EVERY LEVEL AND REALLY

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:09.219
IMPACTING OUR CITIZENRY IN

00:53:09.286 --> 00:53:11.187
SIGNIFICANT WAYS AND I THINK WE

ALL FEEL THAT. THAT WERE IN THAT

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:15.725
PAIN THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING

00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:17.928
SO I KNOW I'M TRYING TO EXAMINE

00:53:17.994 --> 00:53:19.229
THIS BILL. AS OBJECTIVELY I CAN

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:20.630
BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO RAISE

00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:22.265
RATES OKAY SO THEN. THE QUESTION

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:23.900
REALLY IS DO WE HAVE A

00:53:23.967 --> 00:53:24.768
DYSFUNCTIONAL MARKET PLACE

00:53:24.834 --> 00:53:27.337
WHERE- WHAT PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:28.872
GETTING REALLY ISN'T WORKING AND

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:32.375
IRRESPECTIVE OF THE LENGTH OF

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:33.476
TIME THAT THIS HAS BEEN IN

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:35.345
PLACE. I RISK THAT THAT HELP.

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:36.680
THEM THAT STILL DOESN'T ANSWER

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:38.048
FOR ME THAT CENTRAL QUESTION

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:39.916
WHICH IS THAT. IF A REQUIREMENT

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:41.518
A MINIMUM BECAUSE WORSE OR

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:43.119
SETTING AN EXPECTATION THAT IS

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:45.055
WHAT IS REQUIRED TO DEAL WITH

00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:47.490
THE MOST COMMON. OR THAT THE

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:50.160
AVERAGE OR WHATEVER- COSTS OF.

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:54.531
IN. THEN WE MAY HAVE A DATE YOU

00:53:54.598 --> 00:53:56.399
KNOW THAT THAT'S A CENTRAL

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:57.267
QUESTION FOR ME SO I GUESS MY

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:59.502

00:57:25.008 --> 00:57:25.742
INADEQUATE OR UNFAIRLY

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:27.944
DISCRIMINATORY WE DO BELIEVE

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:30.113

HAVE A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION

00:57:33.082 --> 00:57:34.751
DATE WILL ALLOW FOR THE

00:57:34.818 --> 00:57:36.553
DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO CREATE

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:39.489
A PROCESS INTERN FOR INSURANCE

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:43.760

THE TIME TO- PROVIDE WHAT THEY

00:57:53.403 --> 00:57:54.938
BELIEVE WOULD BE NEEDED TO

00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:58.808
ENSURE ADEQUATE RATE TO ME S. B.

00:57:58.875 --> 00:57:59.409

I'D HEARD YOU SAID IS IT IF THIS

00:58:07.684 --> 00:58:09.319
BILL IS ENACTED INTO LAW THAT

00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:11.321
THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE

00:58:11.387 --> 00:58:12.355
THAT. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY CAN

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:13.456
COME AND ASK FOR RATES TO DEAL

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:15.992
WITH THOSE HIGHER OBLIGATIONS

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:17.060
BUT MY QUESTION IS DIFFERENT.

00:58:17.126 --> 00:58:18.895
WHETHER THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:19.696

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.204
THAT A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE THAT

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:29.539
ARE INJURED ARE GOING TO GET

00:58:29.606 --> 00:58:31.274

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:37.513
CHANGE IN THE LAW. TO DEAL WITH

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.482

THESE OTHER STATES IN WHO WHO

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:07.256

I WOULD JUST SAY. WE'VE ALREADY-

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.768
IT KNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS GOING TO

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:19.368
RAISE THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE

SAID FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH THAT'S

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:24.140
LESS THAN FIFTY. DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:27.710
I DIDN'T PRACTICAL TO- THE LIKE

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:30.246
A COUPLE OF START. WATER IN A

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:32.381
ONCE A- WORKING IN THE CHIEF

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:35.451
SMALLEST WHAT TO. LOOK AT NOBODY

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:36.919
WANTS EXTRA PRICE TODAY

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:39.055
INCLUDING ME- THE INFLATION

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:40.623
PRESSURES EVERY THAT'S WHY WITH.

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:43.526
THE CHAIR- WAS- INSISTED UPON

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.528
HAVING A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.063
OF THIS BILL SO WE'RE NOT

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.232
CONSUMERS ARE NOT FEELING THIS-

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:51.334
YOU KNOW THIS YEAR DURING- YOU

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.136
KNOW WE'VE GOT A COUPLE MORE.

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:55.204
WAS A TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BRIAN

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:56.806
YEAH SO WE GOT TWENTY TWENTY

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.040
FIVE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION.

01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.343
YOUR DATE ON THIS SO HOPEFULLY

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:01.444
WE'RE BEHIND THIS INFLATIONARY

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:03.613
PERIOD AND NOT MAKING IT A

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:05.448
SIGNIFICANT- ISSUE BUT THIS IS

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:07.383
LET ME JUST SAY. FOR FOUR

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.385
DOLLARS A MONTH IT DOUBLES THE

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.754
COVERAGE. AND I WOULD ALSO GO

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:13.122
FURTHER TO SAY. THIS PROBLEM

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:14.891
EXTENDS NOT ONLY FOR LOW INCOME

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.392
PEOPLE BUT I WOULD CHALLENGE

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:17.593
ANYBODY WHERE MOST THE PEOPLE IN

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.262
THIS ROOM. TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:26.002
WHAT YOUR LIMITS ARE. IF YOUR.

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:26.636
INSURANCE ASIAN IS ASK YOU TO GO

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:28.571

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:35.811
AGENTS INSURANCE AGENT NEW OF

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.180
COURSE THE INSURANCE AGENT WOULD

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:39.982
DO WHAT NOW. BUT NOBODY ELSE

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:42.018
KNEW. WHAT THEIR COVERAGESWERE

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:43.386
WHERE THEY WERE MINIMUM. NO

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:45.121
INSURANCE AGENT EVER ASK THEM

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:46.689

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:48.291
PORTION. OF THIS BILL IS SO

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:50.059

I KNOW THAT THE CENTER DIDN'T

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:54.230
HAVE A DIRECT ANSWER TO MY

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:55.631
QUESTION IF THERE ARE EXPERTS

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:57.900
FROM EITHER SIDE TO KNOW THE

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.101
ANSWER TO THAT.I THINK WE WOULD

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.203
BENEFIT FROM HEARING THAT. IN

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:01.771
THE CASE OF FORTY SEVEN OTHER

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:03.306

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:04.607
LIMITS. DO WE HAVE ANY DATA THAT

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.142
SHOWS HOW THAT HAS BEEN

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:07.376
IMPLEMENTED IN WHO HAS BEEN

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:09.111
AFFECTED BY IT. AND I'D LIKE IT

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:10.680
IF THE CHAIR IS IN AGREEMENT BE
