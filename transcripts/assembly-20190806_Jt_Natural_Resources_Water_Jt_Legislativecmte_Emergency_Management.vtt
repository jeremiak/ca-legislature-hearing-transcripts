well as the emergency response

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.170
efforts to start off I did want

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:39.205
to invite the president of our

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:41.174

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:09.202
community. Just a little bit of

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:14.841
housekeeping notes. The exits

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:15.475

come out. Any open door. We

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.849
have refreshments in the back

everybody so please get up and

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.826
help yourself any time you

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:36.896
would like. And also I want to

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:37.497
say that there is wifi access

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:43.102
in the room. I should have

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.104
started with that one. Wifi

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.040
access I'm not going to go

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:47.640
through the instructions we

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:50.844
taped about ten sheets of paper

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.377
around the back with the

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.981
instructions on them so I have

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:55.648
to bother you too. If you need

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:58.918
wifi access take a moment get

00:01:58.985 --> 00:01:59.452
up and take a look at the

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.856
instructions and if it does not

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:05.091
work for you Dick talk to one

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.160
of the- neighbor council

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.128
members and we'll try to help

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.264
you. Make that access work so

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:15.168
with that. Senator and some

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.237

to all of you in attendance

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.311
today as many of you know

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:27.080
because we've had conversations

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:27.680
with you it's been incredibly

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.082
important about senator stern

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:30.950
myself and our colleagues from

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.019
across the San Fernando Valley

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.954
to convene a session like this

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.190
to answer a number of remaining

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.958
unresolved questions. About

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:42.962
what are we to do as the Ellie

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.964
so canyon facility remains open

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.200
remains a concern to the entire

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:51.004
community what are we prepared

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.006
for in terms of an emergency

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:53.540
response were there to be

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.074
another blow out was the

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:57.176
response across a number of

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.345
sectors governmentally and

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:01.214
community wide. Sufficient to

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.349
have protected the community

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:05.418
and but we know the answer to

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:09.022
many of those questions is no.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:11.124
And so how do we solve it going

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.393
forward so our hope is to get

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.927
answers to some of those

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.261
unresolved questions to

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:17.230
continue to move this community

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.965
towards progress towards

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.200
safety. And it's a it's a

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:21.801
pleasure to have you all here

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.303
we do have a lot of content to

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.104
get through we are of course

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.973
welcoming robust a public

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.108
comment during this hearing but

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:29.709
again thank you all for being

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.077
here we appreciate your

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:31.644
patience with what will be

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:35.248
probably a very long series of.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:43.022
Testimony in questioning. I

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.556
have a public comment is

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:44.958
currently structured for the

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:45.558
after the third pan after the

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.260
second panel. So you I'm sorry

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.228
after the third panel so first

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:49.829
we'll be looking at the root

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.264
cause analysis of the leak with

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:52.966
the administration and blade

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:55.101
energy. Second will be looking

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.070
at the response from third

00:03:57.136 --> 00:04:00.974
parties NGOs and- the gas

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.608
company if they choose to show

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:05.178
up. And third will be looking

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:05.712
at the emergency response

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:07.313
efforts and public comment

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.847
would be after the at that

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:25.031
point. Yeah. Maybe so. So

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.100
before we do this match. Do you

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.335
want to if we want to let some

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:29.902
public comment occur at the

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.037
front end because I know a lot

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.206
of people are here today who

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:35.241
maybe have jobs. Families work

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:41.080
to do. And we also know that

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:43.116
this community has been

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:45.151
fighting for way too long to.

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:47.286
Get justice and to shut this

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:49.389
facility down but with with

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.190
with respect to the congressman

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:51.791
I did want to let him deliver

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:55.228
some opening remarks and then

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:55.862
we can figure out if there's a

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.296
structured way to make a few

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.365
comments. To the administration

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:01.334

to simply member Reavis for a

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:13.246
brief opening comment if you'd

00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:13.780

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.381

in terms of what the response

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.576
was and what we can do better

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:45.411
as a state. To prevent this

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:47.513
from ever happening so thank

hill have been on it. Did you

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:09.102

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:09.702
a brief opening remark we'd be

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:13.139
happy to welcome you. You Sir.

The I do hope we hear from the

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:19.245
community briefly as well

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:21.514
before we go to the panel is to

00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:25.118
the suggestion I want to thank

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:27.286
senator Henry stern and so we

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:29.422
members so this myth that read

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.557
this for joining us at then

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:33.459
creating this hearing and I

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:35.595
want to thank the Porter ranch

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:39.132
community school for hosting us

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.601
and of course the neighborhood

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:45.238
council as well. Of course this

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:47.240
school was shut down as a

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:47.774
consequence of the only so

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.342
canyon blow out. Our family

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:53.212
lives just up the hill. Just

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.448
about as close as anyone to

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:59.352
well SS twenty five. Our

00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:03.222
neighbors evacuated for months

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:07.226
we relied on those filters. I'm

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:07.860
sure they'll be some positions

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.729
here to tell us whether it was

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.430
our neighbors are ourselves and

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:13.366
made. The right decision. So I

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:15.601
can tell you from my own

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:17.436
experience that when people

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:19.438
move to Porter ranch they were

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.641
not told. That so cal gas had

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:23.442
neglected under ultrasonic

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.411
testing that would have

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.280
identified dangerous anomalies.

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:29.615
That injections were routinely

00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:31.751
made through the two being or

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.619
the casing whatever was handy

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:35.588
at the time. And that the deep

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:39.258
subsurface safety valves that

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:39.759
could have stopped this

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:43.362
tragedy. Had been removed in

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:45.298
nineteen seventy nine and not

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:47.400
replaced. And this was a

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:49.435
continuing mistake as they

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:50.002
could have been replaced in

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:53.573
seventy nine. Or eighty nine or

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.608
ninety nine. Or two thousand

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:59.245
and nine or any day during

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.280
200-010-1112 thirteen it cetera.

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:03.616
In the four months that

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:05.518
followed the blow out more than

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:07.353
eating fat more than eight

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:07.854
thousand families were

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.522
displaced from their homes and

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:11.524
forced to relocate. To schools

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.259
including this one were closed

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.361
for the duration of school year

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:15.962
thousands affected immediate

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:19.432
health symptoms today many

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:21.267
residents faced severe health

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:25.338
issues we'll have to see. The

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:27.306
studies to see what level of.

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:29.508
Carnage was done to the humans

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:33.279
who were here. Before I

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:33.813
criticize the so cal gas

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.514
company though I should take a

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:36.148
minute to criticize the federal

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:45.491
government. Few months after

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:47.393
the blowout I was able to talk

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.528
face to face with president

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:51.864
Obama he made a commitment that

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:53.566
there would be federal natural

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.601
gas storage safety regulations

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:59.372
issued in twenty sixteen. And

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.440
lo and behold in December of

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:01.874
twenty sixteen those

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:03.643
regulations were in fact issue

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:05.578
not everything I wanted but it

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:07.613
for the first time federal

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.682
safety regulations. Just to be

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:13.486
sure. Even after I had this

00:09:13.552 --> 00:09:15.388
promise from president Obama

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:17.290
worked with other members in in

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:19.592
June of twenty sixteen we

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:20.159
passed a law requiring that

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.761
there be federal regulations by

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:25.298
June of twenty eighteen. Of

00:09:25.364 --> 00:09:27.433
course that standard was beaten

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.067
by a year and a half when the

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:31.437
Bob administration issued

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:32.038
regulations again in December

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:33.506
of twenty sixteen. The trump

00:09:33.572 --> 00:09:35.541
administration withdrew the

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:39.445
regulations in twenty seventy.

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:41.681
And now they've told me that

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.382
they're not in violation. Of

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:45.751
the law that says they have to

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:47.520
have regulations by June of

00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:51.424
last year because after all

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.292
they did publish regulations

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:57.363
they just went through them. So

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.465
for those who think that just

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:00.132
by watching M. S. N. B. C. you

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:01.767
can be aware of all the

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:03.602
grievous mistakes of the trump

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:05.638
administration you realize that

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.506
there is not enough time in a

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:09.375
twenty four hour news cycle to

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:09.909
detail the mall. Including

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:15.414
those that affect us here. The

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:17.483
state of California has issued

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.420
regulations. I in rules a-

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:23.422
think it's too easy under those

00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:23.923
rules to avoid having

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.825
subsurface safety valves and I

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.893
know. That you will have other

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.895
hearings as to how tough those

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:33.466
regulation should be. But is a

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:34.100
part of the federal government

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:37.470
it grieves me to report. That

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:39.305
in other states there are no

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:43.476
regulations in their facilities

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:47.513
larger than the one we had here.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.815
We know that this tragedy could

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:51.617
have been avoided. So cal gas

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.919
field conduct detailed follow

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.688
up inspections from other

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:57.623
previous leagues there was a

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.725
weld there was a document and

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:00.259
lack of unnecessary risk

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.761
assessment for the site do a

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.729
very protections were

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:05.598
inadequate there was

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:09.435
insufficient inspections prior

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.036
to twenty fifteen the company

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:11.604
had a lack of it of data or

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.439
even a plan to seal a potential

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.674
leak. And there was a lack of

00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:16.275
real time surveillance of the

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:23.616
wells. We know that. This from

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:24.150
southern California gases

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:27.420
actions after the blowout. They

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:29.688
found that there were many

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:31.757
other wells that needed to be

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:33.793
shut down that S. S. twenty

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:35.728
five was just the first of the

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:41.634
time bombs to go off. So cal

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.504
gas was ordered to track all of

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:46.138
the costs of the lease canyon

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.907
lake including cost relocating

00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:49.608
families medical treatment

00:11:49.675 --> 00:11:51.644
legal fees. However the public

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.612
utilities commission is still

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:55.448
trying to decide whether those

00:11:55.514 --> 00:11:56.048
costs are going to be passed

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:59.518
through to rate payers. The

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:00.186
question must be to the P. you

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:03.456
see not. Worth the cost

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:05.558
necessary after the blowout.

00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:09.628
What was the blow out a result

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:11.630
of negligence. And I think

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:15.601
they'll find not one but a

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:17.670
thousand small axe medium size

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:19.939
extra large Jackson negligence

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:23.876
led to this. To do this the

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:25.611
largest met a leak in the

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:29.548
history I believe of the world.

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:31.550
So the shareholders should bear

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:35.654
the costs associated with

00:12:35.721 --> 00:12:41.460
stopping the leak and the costs

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:47.666
of remediation add up. A I

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:50.035
think if the PC is left to its

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:51.904
own devices. We'll let him pass

00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:53.672
it through they've got to hear

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:54.273
from the legislature I believe

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.541
you did something similar with

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:59.778
the fires. Today we're

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:00.279
discussing Elise canyon

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:00.846
facility that should be shut

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:07.920
down the in I just want to say

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:09.955
a facility that's too big to

00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:17.696
fail is too big to exist. The.

00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:19.832
The negligence shifted into a

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:23.569
new phase on October thirteenth

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.571
twenty fifteen and that is the

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.606
negligence of failing to even a

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:29.608
plan to shut down the facility.

00:13:29.675 --> 00:13:33.646
So cal gas is dead millions of

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:34.246
dollars to fight efforts to

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:35.981
shut it down. And there were

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:38.083
number one argument is we have

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.620
no other plans. If we shut it

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:43.756
down we will be able to provide

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:45.791
gas they'll be blackouts will

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:47.626
be service interruptions. Why

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:49.695
do they have no other plan

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:51.564
because they spend millions of

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.198
dollars fighting the idea that

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:52.765
they should develop another

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:59.905
plan. This is we need to be

00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:03.676
looking at ways to stay first

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:04.276
of all there are those who say

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:07.580
we've got to wait for the post

00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:09.815
of fossel of fuel economy and I

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:11.917
look forward to a post fossil

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:15.788
fuel economy but I'll be if I'm

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:17.756
going to wait until opposed

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:18.324
fossil fuel economy. Before

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.594
they shut it down. Natural gas

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.096
does natural gas really need to

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:25.898
be stored locally in in in

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:29.668
these enormous quantities. Do

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:31.737
we want to store our natural

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:33.772
gas by putting it in

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.808
underground old oil fields

00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:37.910
where the methane mix which

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:41.747
mixes with the witches brew of

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:42.348
subterranean hydro pull up way

00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:46.018
since. Do we want to look at

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:47.753
liquid vacation as a way to

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.624
store natural gas. Maybe not

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.157
but we've got to look at

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:54.126
something and we've got a look

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:57.730
at the way the before we get.

00:14:57.796 --> 00:15:01.734
To a to no natural gas we go we

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.036
have no storage of lease of gas

00:15:04.103 --> 00:15:07.740
at least so canyon. Of love

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:11.844
natural gas Italy so canyon. So

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.912
I want to thank you for holding

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:15.981
this hearing. Thank you for

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:19.618
letting me speak at this time.

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:21.754
This is a tragedy that has hit

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.023
this community. In a continuing

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:25.958
tragedy that every day my kids

00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:28.027
need to look up the hill. And

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.728
wonder what will happen next.

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.997
So when it comes to the efforts

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:34.133
of southern California gas to

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:36.035
pass these costs on to

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:39.705
consumers. Shut it down. And

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:40.272
when it comes to lease so

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:41.940
canyon natural gas storage

00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:45.844
facility shut it down. Thank

00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:49.982
you so much. Thank you

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:52.017
congressman I think now since

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:53.819
the community doesn't just want

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:55.788
to speak to the legislature but

00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:57.790
also to the administration I'm

00:15:57.856 --> 00:15:59.825
an invite up our first panel.

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:01.994
To be here to hear a brief

00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:03.896
period of testimony and then

00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:05.798
we'll continue on with the

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:08.033
hearing so if it this time we

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.735
could have secretary crowfoot

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.137
deputy director Marshall from

00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:14.006
the California department of

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:17.910
conservation. As well as Ravi

00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:19.945
Krishnamoorthy with blade

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:21.880
energy partners join us on the

00:16:21.947 --> 00:16:31.724
first panel. We can yeah. And

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:32.424
I'm sorry so I was just told we

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:35.728
also have congresswoman hill

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:36.295
has a representative here as

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:38.197
well. Congresswoman is been a

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:40.099
fighter since the moment she

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:43.736
got in the office so if heard

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:46.071
district director I believe

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:47.773
it's Angela G. a caddy is here.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.908
Mr Kerry did you want to make a

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:50.542
brief remark before we open for

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:51.910
a brief period of community

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:54.012
comment. Thank you and welcome

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:54.480
and thank you to the

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:55.981
congressman sorry thank you I'm

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:57.916
in thank you so much for

00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:00.018
shedding light on this really

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:01.987
important issue. I am I

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:04.056
representing Congress I'm in

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:06.091
hell and we have this brief

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:09.962
statement on the issue so in

00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:11.897
twenty fifteen and twenty

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:13.832
sixteen for a period of one

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:15.801
hundred and eighteen days. A

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:16.402
single pipe storage well at a

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:17.970
lease canning gas storage

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:19.838
facility. Link tens of

00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:21.974
thousands of tons of natural

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.778
gas into the air. More than

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:26.378
eight thousand families were

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:27.946
forced to evacuate their homes

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:30.115
and many suffered health

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:32.217
conditions like headaches and

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:35.754
nose bleeds. Some suffered

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:38.090
worse the incident and heard

00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:38.690
and estimated one billion in

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:42.027
damages and was one of the

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:42.628
worst environmental disasters

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:47.766
in history. The end the

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:48.333
equivalent annual pollution

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.002
output output of almost six

00:17:50.068 --> 00:17:50.569
hundred thousand cars. Data

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:51.203
mandated by the department of

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.870
transportation indicates that

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:52.471
more than ten thousand wells

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:54.239
nationwide. Rely on a single

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:55.941
pipe design and that two

00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:56.442
hundred and ninety six

00:17:56.508 --> 00:17:57.976
underground storage facilities

00:17:58.043 --> 00:18:00.245
across thirty two states

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:03.949
utilize such wells. We know

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:05.918
that these designs are not the

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:06.518
safest were more secure let a

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.220
lease serve as a warning. We

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.022
need to be working towards

00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:11.957
implementing stronger solutions

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:12.524
in those currently operating

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:15.928
storage facilities. These

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:18.030
canyons gas leak was the worst

00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:18.530
single gas leak in U. S.

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:20.032
history in terms of

00:18:20.098 --> 00:18:22.000
environmental impact. Its

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:24.102
carbon footprint was larger

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:25.838
than the deepwater horizon leak.

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:28.207
The release of the full root

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:28.707
cause analysis was quite

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:32.277
concerning. Among oil and gas

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:33.946
production wells gas storage

00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:34.546
wells did not continue fluid

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:37.983
flow to the inner tubing but

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:38.584
also allowed flow in the an

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.219
annual between the casing and

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.221
the two being provided no

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:44.056
protection from leakage in the

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:45.958
event causing failure casing

00:18:46.024 --> 00:18:48.026
failure. The casing failed and

00:18:48.093 --> 00:18:48.627
the ensuing leak poison to the

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:52.097
community. Processes and

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:53.899
procedures were not in place to

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.834
and ensure safe operation.

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:56.268
There were certainly

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:58.070
shortcomings in regulatory

00:18:58.136 --> 00:18:59.972
oversight. Some have been

00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:01.974
corrected and while others are

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.474
in the process of being

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:04.076
corrected. The California

00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:06.178
legislature did its part with

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:08.146
laws like S. B. thirty eight

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:09.915
and ask be eight eight seven.

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:10.449
Establishing world leading

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:12.351
minimum standards for storage

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:14.286
wells. California has made

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:16.355
numerous improvements in its

00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:18.257
storage well standards that

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:18.824
should be emulated in other

00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:22.327
states. The only to the LA

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:24.162
county department of health and

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:24.730
its contractors have been

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:26.098
conduct have already conducted

00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:28.200
some health study work. This is

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:28.834
on going through efforts of the

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:30.269
south. The south coast air

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:32.371
quality management district and

00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:36.174
the LA county department of

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:36.775
health funded in part by legal

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.277
settlements. These efforts are

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:40.012
after the fact however. It

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:42.247
should have been it would it it

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:42.814
would have been better to

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:44.249
research and regulate pro

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:46.285
actively some of the public

00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:48.120
health questions raised by

00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:50.122
lease canyon may never be

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:52.190
answered this is not just about

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:53.926
the health and safety of Porter

00:19:53.992 --> 00:19:54.560
ranch residents although that

00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:56.194
is of critical importance to

00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:58.463
us. This is also about insuring

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.332
that the that in the future

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:02.034
there are rapid response plans

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.002
in place for giant leaks no

00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:05.938
delays in bringing necessary

00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:06.505
equipment to stop a spotted

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.373
leak and state regulators who

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.342
take a hands on and proactive

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:12.210
approach and do not ignore

00:20:12.277 --> 00:20:14.346
risks. Above all we know now

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:16.214
that a lease could have been

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:18.050
prevented we know that

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:18.684
countless families could have

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.954
been spared hardship and that

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:22.521
the rippling environmental

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:25.958
impacts could have been avoided

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:28.327
we also know that they should

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:29.962
never and can never happen

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:32.097
again. We know that we can do

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:34.399
better for the people who count

00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:38.003
on us and we will. Thank you.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.207
Thank you ms JK. And now I'd

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:42.841
add a difference in respect to

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.343
the community we'll take

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:45.978
fifteen minutes here to offer

00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:47.980
an opportunity for a few brief

00:20:48.046 --> 00:20:50.215
public comments so we're gonna

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:52.517
let you take an effort at self

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:56.088
organizing and up a portion

00:20:56.154 --> 00:20:58.256
then so it's ten thirty right

00:20:58.323 --> 00:21:00.392
now. And so depending on how

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.227
many people are going to be

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:04.329
speaking we can apportion the

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:08.166
public comments accordingly.

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:10.168
Let's take a look here. So

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:10.736
we're gonna say two minutes

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:14.406
each. So that would be a grand

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:18.210
total about seven people. I

00:21:18.276 --> 00:21:18.744
know there are many more

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.345
stories in the room and you

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:22.514
will each and everyone of you

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:25.984
have time to tell your story.

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.986
But for the moment we're going

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:28.587
to ask you to limit it. To two

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:32.290
minutes each. Welcome and good

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:33.992
morning if you could start by

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:36.194
please saying your name and

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:38.063
where you're from. Okay on I'm

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.165
Patti click G. L. U. E. C. K.

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:42.200
and I've lived in the Porter

00:21:42.267 --> 00:21:44.236
ranch area for about twenty

00:21:44.302 --> 00:21:44.836
five years and I am a native

00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:48.006
valley girl. And I wanna thank

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:48.674
you for holding this right here

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.575
where it happened one point

00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:52.110
eight miles away. We're

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:54.279
representing the one and a half

00:21:54.346 --> 00:21:56.014
million residents of the

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:58.016
northern San Fernando Valley.

00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:00.185
Our area covers the spectrum of

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:02.154
these social economic scale

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.089
from apartment dwellers to

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:06.324
homeowners in gated communities

00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:08.126
and for four years we've been

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:10.195
lied to by south all gas. The

00:22:10.262 --> 00:22:10.829
C. P. U. C. darker the county

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:12.497
department of public health and

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:14.132
many other agencies and even

00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:16.234
our own brave firefighters have

00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:18.136
been lied to by cell call gas.

00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:20.272
And public health we've been in

00:22:20.338 --> 00:22:22.040
the day with Carson Jensen

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:22.674
other toxic chemicals on daily

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:24.309
basis with fear major

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:26.311
earthquakes. There's been fires

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:30.248
on so cal gas property over the

00:22:30.315 --> 00:22:30.849
years and destroyed homes we

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:32.417
were left out of the discussion

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:34.319
concerning the consent decree

00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:36.421
so dairy cal's a couple hundred

00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:38.356
miles away. Are being used to

00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:40.358
provide corrosive and explosive

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:42.461
Biomet thing to be stored right

00:22:42.527 --> 00:22:44.362
here only self. And the

00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:46.131
department of conservation

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.133
declared a Lisa to be safe.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.335
Even though that was before the

00:22:50.402 --> 00:22:52.504
root cause analysis was really

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:54.539
beginning am one blade energy

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:58.143
released its report that you'll

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.312
hear about. It said police so

00:23:00.378 --> 00:23:02.214
have been poorly maintained and

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.449
mismanaged so our faith and

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:10.155
trust in the system that should

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:12.557
have been protecting our health

00:23:12.624 --> 00:23:16.161
and safety. Has been vastly

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.463
compromise so I'm presenting

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.132
the state was some documents

00:23:20.198 --> 00:23:20.665
for the record. And that

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:22.501
includes a series of articles

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:32.210
that I did for knock LA. As

00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:34.479
testimony thank you so much

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:36.481
padding. Okay next thank you so

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:38.583
much my name is Maureen Capra I

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.117
have lived here forty five

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:42.587
years. I have I side of that

00:23:42.654 --> 00:23:46.158
well from my front door. When

00:23:46.224 --> 00:23:48.160
all this happened we've now

00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:50.262
realize why be been so sick

00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:50.896
I've gotten asthma the bloody

00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:52.631
noses everything over all these

00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:54.599
years not just then. When it

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:56.501
happened and everybody moved

00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:58.537
out and then they started

00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:00.338
coming back and they would not

00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:00.939
clean my house because I did

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:02.507
not move out. I tried

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:04.442
everything this stuff is in my

00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:06.545
hair it's all inside my house

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:10.182
and- our bodies and everything

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:10.816
something needs to be done to

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:12.551
get rid of this monster up

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:16.354
there we really need help and

00:24:16.421 --> 00:24:16.955
that C. P. you say. If you're

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:20.659

thank you thank you so much.

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:38.376
Welcome good morning name and

00:24:38.443 --> 00:24:40.445
where you're from Sherri their

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:42.447
honeymoon I'm a resident of

00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:44.516
Porter ranch for fifteen years

00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:46.218
I currently reside in Granada

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:46.852
hit northern Granada hills for

00:24:46.918 --> 00:24:50.388
two years I served on the board

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:50.956
ranch neighborhood council

00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:54.392
during the- three most exciting

00:24:54.459 --> 00:24:56.328
years here in Porter ranch your

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:58.697
I got elected a year before the

00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:00.432
gas leak thinking we need to

00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:02.467
have a concert in the park or

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:04.669
maybe an art walk. Didn't know

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:05.237
I was going to get a PhD in

00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:08.340
government. Agencies up at this

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:10.408
point I have a few words. At

00:25:10.475 --> 00:25:12.210
piggy backing on Christmas

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:14.546
emergency. Response emergency

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:18.383
notification that's critical.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.050
Nobody knew my kids school was

00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:22.387
close we relocated we all know

00:25:22.454 --> 00:25:24.356
the stories. But moving forward

00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:24.890
I think it's very very

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:26.658
important that we have

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:30.362
coordination of agencies.

00:25:30.428 --> 00:25:30.829
Communication between

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:34.232
departments. And putting public

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:36.368
safety above all else. I don't

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:40.238
know why. It would take nearly

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:42.340
four years to even start start

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:46.411
the committee on a public.

00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:47.045
Safety in the study I mean is

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:48.647
this crazy anyway thank you

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:50.682
again center stern and Christy

00:25:50.749 --> 00:25:52.550
Smith for. Doing this and we

00:25:52.617 --> 00:25:53.118
appreciate all you do thank

00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:56.488
you. Thanks sure. Welcome Sir

00:25:56.554 --> 00:25:58.490
good morning. Good morning

00:25:58.556 --> 00:26:00.425
doctor Tom Williams from el

00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:04.362
Sereno why am I here. Because

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:06.564
this has been a tragedy I

00:26:06.631 --> 00:26:08.466
started helping. Save Porter

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:12.470
ranch organization. In twenty

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:14.706
fifteen. We found out what was

00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:18.610
wrong. Tubing flow no it was

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:22.347
casing flow all the time since

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:24.349
nineteen seventies what causes

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:26.651
the corrosion freezing and

00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:28.620
thawing of the casing the one

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:32.691
single barrier protecting the

00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:36.494
entire community from over two

00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:37.028
thousand PSI gas. And the

00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:38.730
entire field how much of the

00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:40.799
field drained out of that one

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:44.536
well guess what every time is

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:48.373
the middle was made to doctor

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.608
and the CPUC including any

00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:52.644
other well logs. They were

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.813
wrong they were fraudulent Lee

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:58.416
wrong they were done by a

00:26:58.483 --> 00:27:00.385
contractor under gas company

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:02.554
authority they were submitted

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.456
by a gas company authority to

00:27:04.522 --> 00:27:06.725
the state. Agencies that were

00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:08.760
supposed to be regulating them

00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:16.368
also Dogger requires that every

00:27:16.434 --> 00:27:20.438
oil field gas field. Have an

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:21.072
emergency response plan which

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:21.706
is supposed to be approved by

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:22.407
the LA county fire department.

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:26.544
Nothing was done you put a

00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:28.580
quarter of a million people at

00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:32.484
risk because the gas blue well

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:36.421
thank god it did not explode.

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:38.490
Else wise you would really have

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:40.392
a problem however there was

00:27:40.458 --> 00:27:42.627
only one set of samples taken

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:44.429
directly from the blow out.

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:48.400
Authorized by the LA county

00:27:48.466 --> 00:27:49.034
fire department they sent a guy

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.470
in. With no protection. To

00:27:52.537 --> 00:27:56.674
sample. Over the lower

00:27:56.741 --> 00:28:00.612
explosive limit at ten feet

00:28:00.678 --> 00:28:04.449
from the well blow out.

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.551
Unprotected another one god

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:08.586
help him I don't know what

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:10.655
happened to him so there's a

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.590
real basic problem thank you

00:28:12.657 --> 00:28:14.592
doctor the laws that were in

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:18.463
force at the time. We're being.

how much I can cover in two

00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:44.589
minutes. I'm going to try. I am

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.858
very angry. I am very upset

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:50.495

standing there to present the

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.968
health department this man

00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:58.670
sitting here to present a

Kathryn Barker's office which

00:28:59.337 --> 00:29:02.707
is their boss. I am not a gas

00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:04.709
company for what they did to us

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:06.878
but that's a business that

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:07.512
running because all they think

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:10.715
about this money. But these

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:11.282
people are supposed to help

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:12.917
our- health. There are there to

00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:14.786
help us they haven't done

00:29:14.853 --> 00:29:16.754
anything to help us actually

00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:18.590
they have been back stopping us

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:20.625
because this doctor sent a

00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:21.259
letter. To all the doctors and

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:22.894
clinics around here. When my

daughter was in the E. R.

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.600
trailing up. Violently I also

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.802
tweet test that she protested

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:32.704
for toxicology and they said

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.739
this doctor has sent a letter

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:36.674
department of health that's on

00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:37.275
the letter. For us not to be

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:38.910
tested so nothing would be

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:40.778
documented I am pissed I'm

00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:42.780
upset I'm angry. And I think I

00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:44.983
have every right to be angry my

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:48.853
daughter went to Santa Monica

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.590
when she's there. She's fine.

00:29:52.657 --> 00:29:54.826
When she comes. Last night she

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:58.596
had such a terrible headache.

00:29:58.663 --> 00:30:00.932
Listening I'm sorry to say this

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:01.533

00:30:03.034 --> 00:30:05.003

hour for this meeting that I've

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:10.875
been promoting. So much because

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:14.646
I was sick. To be to live. We

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:15.280
should be living here I know I

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:16.748
need to move from here but

00:30:16.814 --> 00:30:18.583
right now for personal reasons.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.217
I cannot I have elderly parents

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:20.852

have life I know I know is a

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.887
good time for me to leave.

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:24.923
That's why I'm here but this is

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:26.758
not right they just shut down

00:30:26.824 --> 00:30:28.593
this. Fun burger here in

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.227
Granada hills because they saw

00:30:29.294 --> 00:30:31.029
a cockroach. They're telling me

00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:32.730
they cannot shut down displays

00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:37.001
the. Poisoning everybody. You

00:30:37.068 --> 00:30:37.602
know what it does to me but I

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:46.945
think. This so blood disorders.

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.947
This is not just headache I'm

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:50.748
Illinois. It's way. Way more

00:30:50.815 --> 00:30:54.652
than that. I need you. To

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:55.253
present to the one of us yeah

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.590
what did the government. Some

00:30:58.656 --> 00:31:00.792
he told me himself personally

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:01.359
at USC number two one year.

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:01.893
When they were running for

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.961
governor he promised me himself

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:04.862
I have a picture with him that

00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:06.864
he would shut this place down

00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:08.700
when he's in office I'm still

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:09.334
waiting for that. Please give

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.837
him my muscles. Thank you for

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:13.438
coming to our coming thank you

00:31:13.504 --> 00:31:18.910
miss it. Good morning and

00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:20.912
welcome thank you could go on

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:23.047
to the twenty eight year

00:31:23.114 --> 00:31:23.615
resident Porter ranch never

00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:24.616
knew of the size of this field.

00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:26.818
Or new I've ever met anybody

00:31:26.884 --> 00:31:27.352
that knew the size of this

00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:30.622
field. Arm there's a major

00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:32.957
trust issue amongst the

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:34.626
regulators in this community.

00:31:34.692 --> 00:31:36.761
By show of applause how many

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:37.362
agree with Helen that there is

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:37.829
just no trust with the

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:46.771
regulators. So. The trust is

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:47.372
I'm I'm I'm searching for an

00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:49.107
answer in in business and

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:50.708
that's what I spent most of my

00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:52.610
career on when there is this

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:54.679
much of a trust issue is

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:56.714
because of a misalignment

00:31:56.781 --> 00:31:57.315
misalignment of objectives and

00:31:57.382 --> 00:32:00.852
goals etcetera. I'm I have

00:32:00.918 --> 00:32:02.720
spent personally more time

00:32:02.787 --> 00:32:05.023
speaking to many of you on this

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:06.924
panel who I think everyone

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:08.726
would agree are very very busy

00:32:08.793 --> 00:32:09.327
people with with with contents

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:13.131
calendars. This community has

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:14.899
never met with our poor

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:16.801
supervisor Karyn but Katherine

00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:18.703
Barker. That is astonishing to

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.672
me. That I can have a

00:32:20.738 --> 00:32:21.239
conversation with the state

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:23.041
senator about this issue. Or

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:26.844
Jason Marshall from pop dagr

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:28.980
but I can have a conversation

00:32:29.047 --> 00:32:30.815
with my supervisor the jerk.

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:32.917
I've asked you many times. That

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:36.788
one's on you and your boss. So

00:32:36.854 --> 00:32:37.355
the alignment issue what I

00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:38.923
would really as an example and

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.059
I speak with with credibility

00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:43.094
because- I have been working

00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:44.929
with public health. For over

00:32:44.996 --> 00:32:46.998
three years. I am on the

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:50.868
community advisory group to

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:51.469
interface with public health.

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:52.937
On the health study. Yep we're

00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:55.039
very far apart and with this

00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:57.175
community needs and deserves

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:57.775
and I'll study and I will wrap

00:32:57.842 --> 00:33:01.012
this up and. And I have to

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:02.747
wonder why we are so far apart

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:03.414
so we question that deserves to

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:06.784
be answered in this hearing.

00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:07.385
And let's use public health is

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:11.022
the example. Is why are you not

00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:12.990
operating in the public

00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:16.861
health's interest. What is your

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:19.063
charter what what how are you

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:23.034
being evaluated. Who gives you

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:25.103
directions and what does good

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:26.904
lookalike from those people

00:33:26.971 --> 00:33:28.773
they give you direction because

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.307
we have a fundamental mis

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:32.777
alignment of objectives I'm

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:33.311
trying to advocate for my

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:33.845
community and my family on

00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:37.081
health issues. I am not able to

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:38.816
do that with the present.

00:33:38.883 --> 00:33:41.185
Obstacles that public health is

00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:44.789
put in front of us there is

00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:45.456
eight don't look don't find and

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:50.828
when you do find. I about it.

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:51.396
How can this community have

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:53.231
trust in that sort of alignment

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:55.166
please I would like to leave

00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:56.901
today with an answer that

00:33:56.968 --> 00:34:00.872
question who do you serve and

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:01.439
how are you evaluated. Thank

00:34:01.506 --> 00:34:06.778
you thank you Mr Clark. Welcome

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:07.412
to morning good morning my name

00:34:07.478 --> 00:34:10.782
is Alexander Nikki. California

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:12.784
director with food water watch

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:13.351
we've been working in this

00:34:13.418 --> 00:34:15.052
community since twenty fourteen

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:17.255
when terminal wanted to expand

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:19.056
their drilling operations up

00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:19.657
here and we went door to door

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.359
in the community and found out

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:22.894
pretty quickly that. What

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.561
Maureen has said is true people

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:25.163
had been smelling this have

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.798
been getting sick for years.

00:34:26.864 --> 00:34:29.033
And when we try to direct the

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.802
attention to the gas company

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:31.335
point to that say there's

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:32.970
something bigger going on here.

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:35.139
Everyone ignored us and really

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:35.673
said well nobody's ever

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.175
complained before and then the

00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:38.976
blowout happened and we were on

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.812
the ground ready to go and wait

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:41.412
I know that's how we met we

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:43.247
spoke when you were working for

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:43.815
the governor I brown at the

00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:45.216
time. And you were so helpful

00:34:45.283 --> 00:34:46.884
you were about the fresh air

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:47.485
and I really hope that we can

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:50.888
continue to work. Together now

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:51.456
that you're in the position

00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:53.124
that you're in this this issue

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:55.126
is about two things

00:34:55.193 --> 00:34:55.693
accountability which you've

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.261
heard a lot about. The public

00:34:57.328 --> 00:34:59.096
agencies who failed us. Who

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:01.199
continue to side with the gas

00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:02.934
company and repeat their

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.138
talking points and shutting it

00:35:07.205 --> 00:35:11.008
down and so we really want to

00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:13.244
know from you where is the

00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:15.213
governor on this what are you

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:18.916
prepared to do what is the

00:35:18.983 --> 00:35:21.018
plan. We also invite the

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:22.954
governor to come to this

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.156
community and meet with this

00:35:25.223 --> 00:35:28.826
community you really will not

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.928
understand what this these

00:35:30.995 --> 00:35:32.830
people have been through until

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:35.066
you have heard their story. And

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:37.268
she said that you were on site

00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:39.203
every day during the blow out

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.239
you were there when so cal gas

00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:43.174
failed all those kill attempts

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:45.309
right. And you had that

00:35:45.376 --> 00:35:49.080
responsibility to make sure

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:51.115
they were doing their due

00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:58.956
diligence. That will will will

00:35:59.023 --> 00:35:59.590
work with the rest of this line

00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:01.092
here so everyone can be heard

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:03.194
but- you've been all very up.

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:07.031
Yes civil so thank you so much

00:36:07.098 --> 00:36:07.598

yeah many Michael on. Yeah we

00:36:11.102 --> 00:36:11.602
are all living on a ticking

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:15.206
time bomb right here. The big

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:17.508
gap whatever the heck you call

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:19.510
it you know I mean look at the

00:36:19.577 --> 00:36:22.980
net go look it all together

00:36:23.047 --> 00:36:25.149
places that have gone natural

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:29.086
gas lookout many people had

00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:31.055
died because of. The explosion.

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:35.026
You know I mean we have

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:35.593
children let me here and we

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.030
have. The talks the you know be

00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:39.564
had at. I think you can I

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.232

said we're all seeing right now

00:36:47.738 --> 00:36:49.206
on a ticking time bomb. There's

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:53.177
thousands of people who had

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:59.016
been killed. In those debate on.

00:36:59.083 --> 00:36:59.550
Gas explosions. You know

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:01.018
because it's not right I mean.

00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:06.991

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:06.584
for attending to the matter.

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:08.586
We're gonna resume a brief

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:10.388
period of public comment now.

00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:14.525
And at some point will invite

00:38:14.592 --> 00:38:18.429
secretary crowfoot back up soon

he took a little recess himself

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:22.967
but we have a few more minutes

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:24.535

Thank you for cooperating thank

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:37.014
you senator Henry stern and

00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:38.749
thank you for convening this

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:40.551
up. Special meeting. And thank

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:42.687
you Brad Sherman congressman

00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:44.755
Sherman for his comments to my

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:46.691
name is Robert van to hook I

00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:48.659
grew up in the northeast San

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:50.594
Fernando Valley and so more

00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:54.432
from nineteen sixties on so

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:54.999
I've been in the region for.

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:56.434
More than fifty years. I

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.703
attended to cal state

00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:00.604
Northridge for six years and

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:01.238
during that time majoring in

00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:02.740
biology and geography we had

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:04.775
field trips and bought me to

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:06.444
the Porter ranch area in the

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.345
canyons here. So I've been

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:10.815
exposed to the error in the

00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:14.752
risk of flammable and explosive

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:16.554
possibilities. During that time.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.154
I now live by the coast and

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:18.789
played a ray where there's

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:20.458
another gas storage field.

00:39:20.524 --> 00:39:22.460
Which brings me to my research

00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:24.595
and investigation there and

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:25.262
there is precedent for shutting

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:28.666
down. Gas fields of Montebello

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.568
was officially shut down with

00:39:30.634 --> 00:39:32.803
state pushing more than twenty

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.705
years ago or approximately

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:36.874
that. Time and the debate at

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:38.476
that time was whether to shut

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:39.009
down play out a rate or

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:40.711
Montebello so both were

00:39:40.778 --> 00:39:42.747
eligible both were considered.

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:44.982
And at the time they just took

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.717
that first step with one and

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:48.586
played a rate. Never got shut

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:50.688
down there's also a story of

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:52.857
what happens with the gas if we

00:39:52.923 --> 00:39:54.959
don't have gas facilities will

00:39:55.025 --> 00:39:56.560
still be able to have gas to

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:58.496
our homes. And to commercial

00:39:58.562 --> 00:40:00.564
places and it'll be the way the

00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:02.600
state of Arizona stated about

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:04.869
it. And the city and county of

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:12.510
San Diego do that with direct.

00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:16.614
Pipeline passage without going

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:20.484
through a storage process and

00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:22.486
it's purchased on the market

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:24.655
fairly on when gas is available

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:26.557
and from different angles to

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:28.492
the interstate pipeline so.

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.494
It's a baby step it's a small

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:32.496
step to eventually going off of

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:36.567
petroleum or- carbon fuel. US

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:38.602
leaking from LA counties golf

00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:42.673
course and school and a county

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.508
park and I was assigned to that

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:45.142
park for a number of years and

00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:46.844
I got sick. And some part of my

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:48.846
sickness was physical but I was

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:50.514
also feeling stressed knowing

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:51.148
that. At any moment the park

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:52.917
that I was a supervisor at

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.585
could go through a-

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:58.522
flammability or explosion state

00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:59.123
depending on the percentage of

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.591
gas that's concentrated one

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:02.660
last. Thought I wanted to add.

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:04.962
Is that what I also learned is

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.897
the public utilities commission

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:10.634
you see. Has oversight on what

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:12.670
happens to the property when it

00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:14.839
shuts down and currently we've

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:16.574
been noticing in playa del Rey

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.909
that. At least twenty three

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:20.511
properties of already been sold

00:41:20.578 --> 00:41:22.780
to the private sector and have.

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:24.782
On the beach and on the

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:25.349
wetlands edge and they get

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:28.519
converted into home sites. So

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:29.086
we need to have a strategy

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:30.654
because we're going to shut

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:31.255
this down we're gonna shut it

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:32.990
all down. So we need to have a

00:41:33.057 --> 00:41:36.694
strategy that with a law that

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.629
in reinforces the public

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:42.666
utilities commission to say no

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:44.768
to selling their gas company

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:48.672
lands to the private sector.

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:54.645
And instead go into open space

00:41:54.712 --> 00:42:00.751
for parks and they'll be safe

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:04.788
because as the year goes by

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:10.728
with no gas being injected. The

00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:11.262
gas slowly migrates in

00:42:11.328 --> 00:42:12.930
evaporates into the atmosphere

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:20.671
to safe rate so that's really.

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:22.806
Nothing's been done and we're

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:23.440
all still up being poisoned by

00:42:23.507 --> 00:42:28.779
so cal gas. Of first I just

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:30.848
wanted to say that we filed a

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:33.117
nuisance report against so cal

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:38.656
gas. Residents came to my house

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:39.323
as did a member of the A. Q. M.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.826
D. Marianne fan she came but

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:43.427
first you have to stop it so

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:46.864
cal gas before she came to my

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:49.066
house. And she walked into my

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:49.667
house to take the report. And

00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:52.937
we asked her US so why didn't

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:56.840
go so cal gas capture the sixty

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:58.676
six point six parts per

00:42:58.742 --> 00:43:01.045
million. Blow a second league

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:03.013
blow out. On their monitors

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:08.752
when we caught them on Mars and

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:09.320
we have screen shots and she

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:12.690
calmly looked at me. Not not

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:13.324
batting an icing. All they told

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:16.694
me they turn their monitors off.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.163
How can that happen today with

00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:20.931
what we're all living through

00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:22.733
and going on now they are

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.735
installing so cal gas and

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:26.704
starting to more monitors with.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.173
In the neighborhood near eighty

00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:29.773
parking one up right by there

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.010
US. Entrance. Are they going to

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:36.914
have turn off switches that

00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:37.581
they can turn it off when they

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:39.049
don't like a number that comes

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:40.884
out because there's were always

00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:44.755
dead at two at two or off so

00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:46.724
anyways that's just one thing I

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.826
just wanted to bring to your

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:50.728
attention. And another thing.

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:54.999
Dagr Jason. We had a so cal gas

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:57.034
is chemical engineer mei ling

00:43:57.101 --> 00:44:01.005
testified under oath that the

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:06.710
benzene in a lease canyon is a

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:07.277
nine hundred to a thousand

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:10.681
times more than what's being

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:12.983
reported and in fact they were

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.887
testing anymore so cal gas

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:18.722
benzene or for mall don't hide.

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:20.691
At all how nothing's been done

00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:21.325
under oath this came out it was

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:22.993
publicized. We haven't heard

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.697
anything and it's still we

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:27.331
still get you know the with the

00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:28.932
smell I moved in here. One was

00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:31.201
twenty years ago and we would I

00:44:31.268 --> 00:44:33.170
would I'm right there at the

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:35.072
gate practically I'd come home

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:37.241
at two in the morning it

00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:38.976
roundish open the door hit by a

00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:42.713
wall of gas. The smell this is

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.915
twenty years ago and I would

00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:45.482
call and they say over just

00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:47.217
venting. Nobody told us what

00:44:47.284 --> 00:44:49.286
was in those poly toxins that

00:44:49.353 --> 00:44:52.856
we've been breeding all right.

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:53.490
And we still don't know because

00:44:53.557 --> 00:44:58.862
of the pro. Check the chemicals.

00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:00.831
So that's another thing another

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:02.733
thing that's black and white

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.135
something for you wrap your

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:05.736
head around and take care of.

00:45:05.803 --> 00:45:10.908
Nothing nothing's done. Anyways

00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:11.575
those are the two things I just

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:12.943
want to bring your tent and I

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.012
want to introduce my father

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:15.579
Matt came back. Here in the

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:19.149
middle. He loved his community

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:22.886
he love Porter ranch he was a-

00:45:22.953 --> 00:45:25.089
senior softball manager of two

00:45:25.155 --> 00:45:27.091
senior softball teams play

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:29.059
twice a week. All right he

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:33.030
loved life he believed in his

00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:35.065
government he believed that the

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:36.967
government wouldn't let

00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:37.534
anything happen to us as did

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:38.135
all right that's how he raised

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:41.405
me. Since the blow out I have

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:43.240
learned differently so has the

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:45.042
whole community and so has the

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:47.077
world. Learned about are

00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:49.046
captured regulators who are

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:50.914
doing nothing except so cal gas

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:53.083
is business. And our help

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:56.854
department my dad Matt. Now

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.989
doctor. My dad's doctor

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:01.058
wouldn't test for toxins

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:02.926
because nothing is harmless

00:46:02.993 --> 00:46:05.262
because he got a letter saying

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:08.966
don't test. All right he came

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.868
out this is him marching with

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:11.468
us after he read your letter

00:46:11.535 --> 00:46:13.203
and he realized how corrupt you

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:17.007
are and your- click health

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:18.876
department how they're running

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:20.944
they're doing so cal gas is

00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:22.946
work. Not the people's work all

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:24.948
right that's what I wanted to

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:27.084
say I'm a shame I'm ashamed of

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:29.052

the many cancers that we have

00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:35.626
in all the cancer clusters in

00:46:35.692 --> 00:46:39.062
our community. Thank you doctor

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.864

you. As you can tell the

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:13.130
community is. Tremendously

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:15.032
upset this been going on for

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:17.000
such a long time Julie corn

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:19.169
Steen member no not member

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:21.104
retired member of the Los

00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:24.942
Angeles board of education. I

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:25.542
served on the board for twenty

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:27.311
two years. As a matter of fact

00:47:27.377 --> 00:47:29.313
we're this school is located

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:30.914
right now I was the board

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:33.183
member who went out with staff

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.918
to find this particular area.

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:37.221
For a school we look to make

00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:39.189
sure that there weren't wasn't

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:41.191
any earthquake fault lines in

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:45.028
the area. But no one knew that

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:45.596
the gas company was lurking

00:47:45.662 --> 00:47:47.364
right here in the hills behind

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:49.166
the school no one knew. Our

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:51.268
health the department that we

00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:53.370
dealt with did not even tell us

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:56.974
or- possibly know about it. I

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:57.541
moved into the Porter ranch

00:47:57.608 --> 00:48:01.111
area forty years ago. There was

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:03.080
no disclosure at all. Now what

00:48:03.146 --> 00:48:05.148
we sell our homes we have to

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:07.451
disclose that this monster is

00:48:07.517 --> 00:48:09.052
lurking in our backyard. You've

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:11.321
heard from so many people

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:13.290
already about what happened

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:17.160
when the disaster. You know it

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:20.931
fell upon this community. I was

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:22.966
utterly shocked and amazed I

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:25.202
got a phone call from the gas

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:27.037
company was an automated phone

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:29.439
call and I just said stay in

00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:31.174
your home do not go out. I

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:33.310
called the gas company biz I

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:36.980
had no idea what was going on.

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:37.481
I spoke to someone that

00:48:37.547 --> 00:48:40.951
answered the phone. They said

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:41.585
they didn't even know what I

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:43.186
was talking about had no idea I

00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:45.222
said what could I speak to your

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:47.090
supervisor please supervisor

00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:47.557
was put on the phone.

00:48:47.624 --> 00:48:51.061
Supervisor said to me. Just

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:52.963
stay in your home close your

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.065
windows do not go out to you

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:55.699
hear from us again that's when

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:59.136
the explosion took place. None

00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:01.238
of us knew what was going on no

00:49:01.305 --> 00:49:05.042
one had any idea whatsoever. So

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:07.177
I said to the supervisor you

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:07.778
know there are people walking

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:09.346
around the neighborhoods

00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:11.048
they're walking their dogs

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:11.682
there are people cleaning pools

00:49:11.748 --> 00:49:15.118
there people that our gardening

00:49:15.185 --> 00:49:17.054
they're all out there right now

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:17.688
you know what is happening to

00:49:17.754 --> 00:49:19.222
them what's happening to their

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:21.191
health. We didn't know at the

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:23.293
time when they said well it was

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.228
just a little bit of math thing

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:27.130
there was a large explosion in

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:27.698
the history of the United

00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:29.433
States. We didn't know that

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:33.070
there was other VOCs chemicals

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:35.505
benzene hydrogen sulfide and so

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:37.507
forth we didn't know what the

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:39.543
impact was we didn't know that

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:41.378
our animals that were outside

00:49:41.445 --> 00:49:42.012
with that they would become ill

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:45.248
from at her children. We live

00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:47.484
in an area of earthquake faults

00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:49.286
here in Porter ranch has you

00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:49.886
all remember the Northridge

00:49:49.953 --> 00:49:51.288
earthquake which was. A

00:49:51.355 --> 00:49:57.127
disaster for all of us. Not

00:49:57.194 --> 00:49:57.661
only for the community of

00:49:57.728 --> 00:49:59.229
Northridge but the north valley.

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:01.098
How do you have gas wells

00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:03.400
operating. At and there are gas

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:05.235
wells that are fracking in the

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:07.070
area as well that could very

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:09.139
well cause an earthquake. And

00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:11.208
yet we have this huge complex

00:50:11.274 --> 00:50:13.143
the southern California gas

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:15.178
company. I keep looking every

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:17.347
week or two or a month you see

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:21.118
a story on TV on the news of a

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:23.153
of a explosion a gas pipe is

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.122
exploded and natural gas line.

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:27.424
You can't mix together

00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:31.094
communities residents schools

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:33.263
to over schools were evacuated

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.565
because of the odor and no one

00:50:35.632 --> 00:50:37.300
knew what was coming up out of

00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:39.236
the wells. You can't mix the

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:41.338
two together does not work

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:43.206
there has to be another plan.

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:47.177
Hi we really need to get. On to

00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:51.148
much better ways whether it be.

00:50:51.214 --> 00:50:53.383
Wind turbine or solar or it

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.318
cetera. But they're happy this

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:57.320
has to stop he cannot be a part

00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:57.888
of this community or in the

00:50:57.954 --> 00:50:59.523
community for that matter it's

00:50:59.589 --> 00:51:01.458
for two dangerous. I you know I

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:03.326
receive this every month in my

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:05.462
which I'm sure all of you do in

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:07.364
your gas bill. You know when I

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:09.099
read it every month and it says

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:11.268
it mentions a- you know

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:13.103
materials such as gasoline

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.605
natural gas. It's a prop sixty

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:19.176
five warning. It is if you or

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:21.111
add to or near our facilities

00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:23.480
and work sites you will be

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:25.315
exposed to the substances on

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:27.350
the state's list of substances

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:31.321
known. To cause. Cancer or

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:35.292
reproductive toxicity. Natural

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:35.792
gas contains subsistence

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:37.327
substances on the state list.

00:51:37.394 --> 00:51:39.596
Are known to cause cancer or

00:51:39.663 --> 00:51:41.398
reproductive harm and would

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:43.633
like they don't say how close

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.268
you know is it five feet away

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:47.504
is it a mile away is it took

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.239
most of us are just within a

00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:51.241
mile or two if not right in our

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:53.443
backyards. So anyway I employee

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.679
thank you for. Bringing this to

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:59.182
us today thank you scorching.

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:03.453
Welcome good morning. Is there

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.555
like dudes panel thank you for

00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:07.390
having this hearing my name is

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:09.392
David Kerry I've been in this

00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:11.528
area chats worse which was

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:13.463
actually Porter ranch. Turn in

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:14.097
the chats were turned in Porter

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:15.465
ranch back then. Up for fifty

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:21.238
years. My comments sequel

00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:23.306
requires an environmental

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:23.907
impact report where is our E.

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:27.644

system system installed outfall

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:43.593
nothing nada. We have a massive

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.227
contaminant plume of hexavalent

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:51.368
chromium. That goes on charted.

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:51.968
One thousand eighty five chest

castle bay elementary. These

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:03.513
values represent the radiation

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.448
dose from Lisa canyon. Massive

00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:07.617
surface water contamination

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:09.753

groundwater contamination dis

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:15.559
charging as we speak into the

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:17.594
neighborhoods No radiological

00:53:17.661 --> 00:53:21.431

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:23.500
independent water sampling by

00:53:23.567 --> 00:53:24.100
non affiliated to gas company

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:29.306
sampling. No tracking the radio

00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:35.779
before there are being

00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:36.279
deposited at the storage

00:53:36.346 --> 00:53:39.683
facility. Multiple earthquake

00:53:39.749 --> 00:53:40.283
faults are under where you're

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.620
sitting. This means rapid

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:45.555
transport of all these

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:47.624
contamination including strong

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:49.659
team ninety. I'd on one thirty

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:55.298
one. Radio hexavalent chromium

00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:57.300

untested cancer causing

00:53:57.867 --> 00:53:59.436
chemicals radioisotopes to the

00:53:59.502 --> 00:54:01.705
surface where people live in

00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:03.506
this community. Earthquake

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:05.475
fault faults nearly one dozen

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:07.477
known faults exist under the

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:09.379
storage facility regarding the

00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:11.314
unknown faults it is in

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:13.483
anyone's guess but by judging

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.318
the way the Northridge

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:17.320
Northridge quake originated

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:17.854
from an unknown fault they

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:19.356
should tell the panel something.

00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:19.956
In nineteen seventy five will

00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:25.328
fire. It was caused by sparks

00:54:25.395 --> 00:54:25.962
from St hitting the inside of

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:29.432
casing and tubing a fire that

00:54:29.499 --> 00:54:31.368
took four plus years to put out.

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:35.372
Today this same sand fills a

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:36.006
sandstone cap stores reservoir

00:54:36.072 --> 00:54:39.509
in abundance. In nineteen

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:40.076
seventy nine subsurface well

00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:43.380
safety valves were removed.

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:45.348
This after the well fire was

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:45.915
finally cap I read a dare

00:54:45.982 --> 00:54:49.352
predecessor boots and coots

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:49.919
Santa's been flying up the

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:51.721
wells ever since. There is no

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:55.525
end to the sparks in fact fires

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:56.059
are a disaster waiting to

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:59.829
happen. This is new gas. Highly

00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:03.333
corrosive highly radioactive

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.735
deadly. Harvested from uranium

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:07.937
shale from places like the San

00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:09.539
Juan basin and set in New

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:11.708
Mexico. And the Permian basin

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:15.478
in the Texas panhandle. Uranium

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:16.146
shell gas is what is being the

00:55:16.212 --> 00:55:17.781
positive it'll be so canyon not

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:19.749
somebody nine formulation from

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:21.551
yesterday. But the new

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:22.152
formulation that kills people

00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:25.655
out right. When full with

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:27.524
winter storage leaks are

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:29.459
happening all over the place

00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:31.361
and not at just that says

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:31.961
twenty five in Browns canyon

00:55:32.028 --> 00:55:33.930
about two football fields away

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:35.799
from your where you sit. In

00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:37.834
this room at least so you ram

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:39.869
gas floods the roots of ancient

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.805
oak trees that have tapped into

00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:43.840
the water table for over six

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:45.475
hundred years in some cases.

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:47.777
This same gas flows out of the

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:49.579
canyon walls very varying

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:51.748
exposure points such as similar

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:53.650
geologic straddle layers of

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:55.452
rock which gas loses out

00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:57.821
changing from liquid form. To

00:55:57.887 --> 00:55:59.622
gaseous form. Fugitive

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:01.658
emissions are rife. And the

00:56:01.725 --> 00:56:03.660
aquifer meets the surface and

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:05.729
multiple points and it is the

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:07.530
operator doctor instructs the

00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:09.766
gas company to use. To the dump

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:11.768
its poisons including things

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:13.603
like radioactive tracers

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:17.507
strontium ninety tridium I'd I

00:56:17.574 --> 00:56:19.476
one thirty one and various beta

00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:20.043
particle radiation and alpha

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:23.480
radiation. Radioactive tracers

00:56:23.546 --> 00:56:23.947
accompanied shell gas

00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:27.684
transported here from across

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:28.218
the California desert and

00:56:28.284 --> 00:56:29.819
points east. These are always

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.888
part of the gas places into

00:56:31.955 --> 00:56:35.492
storage here. These tracers

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:36.126
have been sprayed all over this

00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:36.760
community and especially during

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:41.531
the blow out. So any my comment.

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:43.666
Earthquake faults act like

00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:45.835
freeways in that contamination

00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:47.837
from the nine thousand foot

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:48.338
deep storage reservoirs

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:51.508
transported into neighborhoods

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:52.142
through a multitude of my Great

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:53.743
Migration pathways when a fault

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:55.979
line intersects the water table

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:57.881
methane converts from gases

00:56:57.947 --> 00:56:59.749
phase into liquid phase benzene

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:01.651
and other volatile organic

00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:03.520
compounds are then transported

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:05.588
into the groundwater in out to

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:06.089
the neighborhoods at a

00:57:06.156 --> 00:57:09.526
multitude of seeps and springs

00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:11.528
downslope. Radioactive

00:57:11.594 --> 00:57:12.128
contamination then makes its

00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:13.663
way to the surface

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:15.799
contaminating the water ways

00:57:15.865 --> 00:57:17.534
when it rains the radioactive

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.502
particles spread infecting

00:57:19.569 --> 00:57:21.604
parks schools and bedrooms when

00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:25.542
the winds blow massive amounts

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:26.109
of radioactive particles in

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:29.512
fact the neighborhoods. Lastly

00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:30.079
Los Angeles regional water

00:57:30.146 --> 00:57:31.548
board reporting is inadequate.

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:33.850
G. O. Syntek is ran by the gas

00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:35.785
company they're reporting is a

00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:37.854
joke state EPA. Needs to take

00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:41.825
over sampling. This is now an

00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:43.626
environmental poisoning issue

00:57:43.693 --> 00:57:45.962
cal EPA and federal EPA need to

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:49.599
be involved. The pipeline and

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:50.166
hazardous materials safety

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:51.901
administration needs to be

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:53.736
working with the state fire

00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:55.538
marshal in providing full

00:57:55.605 --> 00:57:56.139
disclosure on the contents of

00:57:56.206 --> 00:57:57.807
the materials placed in the

00:57:57.874 --> 00:57:59.876
pipes that carry gas here for

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:01.778
storage the state must produce

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:03.780
manifest of all trucks. That

00:58:03.847 --> 00:58:05.715
carry chemicals into the

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:07.550
storage site several open pits

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:09.552
have been used for dumping

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:11.554
chemicals into the creeks that

00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:13.790
flow offsite. Radiation has

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:15.925
been this discovered off site

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:17.927
in the same creeks the gas

00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:19.929
company as open pits that

00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:21.998
dumped directly into the creek

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:25.568
beds when the rays rainy season

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:27.570
occurs each year constituents

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:29.572
of concern begin to flow

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:30.106
downstream off the storage

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:31.808
facility and into the

00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:33.877
communities thank you Sir and

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:35.578
if you could submit your

00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:36.179
testimony for the record we

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:37.647
appreciate the thoroughness of

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:41.618
it we to preach. We appreciate.

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:42.218
Written that written testimony

00:58:42.285 --> 00:58:47.590
certain trip thank you Sir. Hi

00:58:47.657 --> 00:58:49.592
Nancy Hernandez I can't believe

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:50.159
we're still doing this hits

00:58:50.226 --> 00:58:51.728
home for years as a joke

00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:52.228
fiercely specially with

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:53.897
everything you know everything

00:58:53.963 --> 00:58:57.800
that's been uncovered one I

00:58:57.867 --> 00:58:58.434
guess I once a couple things

00:58:58.501 --> 00:59:01.571
but one thing is we do need

00:59:01.638 --> 00:59:03.573
that place that facility shut

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.675
down shut down permanently and

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:07.810
shut down not used for anything

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:12.048
else because somebody I think.

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.917
Sherman I've heard others

00:59:13.983 --> 00:59:16.052
comment we're not gonna store

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:19.822
natural gas will okay no you

00:59:19.889 --> 00:59:21.724
shouldn't store anything and it

00:59:21.791 --> 00:59:23.760
needs to be just shut down and

00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:25.662
not used for anything not

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.764
storing uranium not storing

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:28.364
lithium. If you know what I'm

00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:33.770
getting at. Is CP you see here

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:35.838
I don't they are they're not up

00:59:35.905 --> 00:59:36.406
here but there any are there

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:38.007
here okay well. I'm trying to

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:40.143
understand when the root cause

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:41.978
analysis just came out with

00:59:42.045 --> 00:59:45.615
blade it's my understanding

00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:47.784
that C. B. U. C. instructed so

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:48.318
cal gas. And may have been

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:51.888
doggerel so to find qualified

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:53.890
companies to perform the root

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:57.927
cause. So cal gas. Provided a

00:59:57.994 --> 01:00:01.931
list. Of companies they wanted

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:03.700
to use to provide to perform

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.768
this root cause analysis. And

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:09.839
blade was chosen so at this

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.708
point I have to ask you should

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:12.208
we be restructuring our

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:17.714
judicial system. So that the

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.281
criminal standing trial can

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:19.882
choose his own jury. Because

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:22.118
really that's essentially what

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:27.790
you all allowed to occur. Dr

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:33.930
Cyrus rang in. Gosh. What else

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:36.132
again I was one of the first

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:38.134
parents to do toxicology tests

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:40.069
after he said you know send out

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:40.636
the letter don't do these

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:43.740
toxicology tests I went out of

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.908
state had them perform did them

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:46.542
again to you this was in two

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:47.977
thousand early two thousand

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:51.748
sixteen did to them again in

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:52.281
two thousand seventeen and

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:52.815
eighteen now will probably

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:53.383
continue to do it to see our

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:57.820
changes. We moved away two

01:00:57.887 --> 01:01:01.891
years ago. And. So cal gas back

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.793
my health is in Chatsworth. I

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.964
reported the oily stains. They

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:09.832
sent out an inspector third

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:12.001
party audit the inspector came

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.870
out and I said well I didn't

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:14.470
say it was Elise I told them

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:17.807
they are stains in my house on

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:18.374
the outside the exterior and

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:19.842
the concrete of my house. Send

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.978
out the inspector the inspector

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:23.880
said this is all oil and I said

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:25.948
well I didn't think oil would

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.750
have reached all the way over

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:28.251
here because I am. I was

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:31.821
literally four miles out. He

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:33.756
said I'm gonna write a report

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:34.323
and I'm gonna present it to

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:37.794
them they will decline you.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.962
Said okay. Never hear back from

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.864
them I call back several weeks

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:43.833
later and they said we have to

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:44.434
there was an issue with that

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.837
report. We're gonna send out

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:50.106
another inspector okay not a

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:54.077
third party comes out. Takes

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.945
pictures sample leave I have to

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:57.980
call back again obviously two

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:00.049
weeks later there was another

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:01.784
issue we're going to send a

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:04.053
different company so they send

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:04.620
out a different company and

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.122
then to so cal gas. Gentleman

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:10.026
come in and take samples. They

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:14.230
say the results we can find or

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:17.867
they were inconclusive or there

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:18.468
is nothing we are denying your

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:21.771
claim I said okay I contact

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:22.438
department of public health and

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.006
let them know what occurred

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:25.975
Katy Butler says I'm gonna send

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:26.609
one of our inspectors this is

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:28.277
insane I know that she said I

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.879
know that they are denying

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:32.014
anyone who's beyond the two

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:34.016
mile radius okay. She sends out

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:36.152
her inspector call and I

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:38.121
believe is his name take

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:42.325
samples. Wait wait I don't hear

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:44.227
anything back I call her and

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:46.262
she tells me that the results

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.097
were inconclusive I said what

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:48.664
can I see the data can I see

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:53.870
what the lab. I had to show and

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:54.504
she said we did not send it to

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.205
the lab. And I said what. I

01:02:56.272 --> 01:03:00.076
told you. Exactly what I was

01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:02.111
told it could be you guys just

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:03.880
announced that you found heavy

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:05.882
metals. She said there was

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:09.886
excessive higher than normal.

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:10.486
Amounts of dust found in your

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:16.192
home. Okay. So obviously you're

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:18.127
supposed to test that for heavy

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:18.661
metals right that was the

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:19.195
purpose of you testing the

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:22.398
exterior. And she said well yes

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.133
it is consistent with all the

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.102
other homes in Porter ranch so

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:27.904
where are the results well I'm

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:28.538
gonna have to ask for funds to

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:30.306
be able to send it to the lab.

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:32.141
And I just thought okay that's

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:34.143
just ridiculous. Of and then I

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:38.181
think it was a. At the Hilton

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:41.918

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:44.020
did mention to the local which

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:45.922
is over here I let him know

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.990

we want to release the met

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:10.406
paying that these in the ocean

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:12.041
are you getting at all if we

know. Thank you pretty well.

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:25.988
You know the study to the but

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:26.555
it did. So if you with more

01:05:26.622 --> 01:05:28.024

already have beeping normal

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:30.359
use. You're not. Back can

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.461
replace the thing if you.

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:34.430
Believe that these this stop.

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:36.499
Fiction all. Are up to month so

if you months ago. It was a

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.169
relief are indeed one of the

major newspaper that the day be

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:42.438
the one they bought thing. The

01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:44.440
first and then they're going to

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:45.107
go from here but you're paying

01:05:45.174 --> 01:05:46.409
in. Being paying minutes you

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.344
know. Not only can be rich but

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:52.114
this new form of energy. But

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:52.748
you have to do the research and

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:54.350
the call out that's not. James

01:05:54.417 --> 01:06:02.491

a little really we have to go

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:26.682
for new form of energy. That

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:28.384
people really. In the- I'm a

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:30.386
big guy the- the guy the

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:34.490
energy. The machine is already

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:38.094
being invented from the- I am

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:38.728
fifty we already have the fans.

01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:40.296
What we are asking you sent up

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:42.331
the road there. Please have

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:42.965
exploratory committee you know

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:44.567
who I'm have some people to do

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:46.335
the research in this new form

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:46.869
of energy if we let this

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.404
corporation. I club. Or funny

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:50.239
without having the in the

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:50.840
future because the methane is

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:52.541
it but the coming in great

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:54.310
quantity of fuel we want to do

01:06:54.377 --> 01:07:00.449
that we have already. For the

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:01.083
doctor that would put the I'm a

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:04.420
food. I'm. If we let this movie

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:04.954
is going to be in men for

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.489
months. Let's see if I'm up

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:08.157
into the fifteen kilometer I

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:08.758
maintain that if in the ocean

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:10.459
we happened to be. I think it

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.461
almost Saddam also young on ten

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:14.130
to the twenty killer up twenty.

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:14.797
Two kilograms what it. You know

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.532
when you that it will be a

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.367
question you're going to be a

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:18.934
question we don't have any

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.636
future we will have basement

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.204
paint to come outside. So it's

01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:24.106
up to you. I used to prevent

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:30.346
the new invention. To me let me

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:34.150
up you know. My son. Please.

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:36.519
Then there yes what we know

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:38.120
that the fit. On the doctor

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:38.721
over here. I discussed. With

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.456
the and you know we know that

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:41.023
the thing like you think see

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.491
from the safety we know that

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:44.126
the what is. Going on a program

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:44.727
that they have out hi. Ladies

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:50.433
guy bald. Program which in

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:52.234
which they both disk idea. And

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:54.303
that he- thought please open

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:54.870
your mind a little bit. The

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:56.472
study about nickel. Slot you

01:07:56.539 --> 01:07:57.106
know it's funny about games the

01:07:57.173 --> 01:08:00.509
brand that discovered young

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:01.110
because everything. That I can

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:04.647
be fifty. But we have to look

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:06.816
at thirteen in the night of the

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:07.416
money to you know yeah in the

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:08.384
mail you'll be. Off that you

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:10.519
represent us. Yeah so don't go

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.421
anymore with fourth if you. But

01:08:12.488 --> 01:08:14.390
it is thought to do the thing

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:16.392
immediately you know yes we

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:16.992
know how much time. Thank you

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:20.563
very much Sir. Sorry to throw

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:21.197
another state hearing schedule

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:22.131
all off. But these people

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:22.631
apparently I try to self

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:23.265
regulate them they wouldn't be

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:24.467
regulated. Kinda like the same

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:25.100
agencies you brought here today

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:26.368
that refused to. Regulate but

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:30.306
that's your job. You guys for

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:30.873
coming here to hear from the

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:34.243
people Rackley you can have

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:34.844
these regulators all day long

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.545
up in Sacramento but thank you

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.214
for coming here and seeing the

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:38.747
problem. And having it so

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.516
poignantly. She waited by

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:41.050
Michael passing out on the

01:08:41.116 --> 01:08:44.620
floor. But what really killed

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:46.555
us and this will really

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.157
emphasize what we're we're

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:48.757
dealing with with especially

01:08:48.824 --> 01:08:50.292
the health department is all

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.495
about health. Oh sorry meant to

01:08:52.561 --> 01:08:54.630
go president and cofounder of

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:55.197
say Porter ranch twelve year

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:58.567
resident. It's all about how it

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.636
would be here. Wasn't the issue

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:04.573
so seeing and I took a quick

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.207
poll when this happened. We saw

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:08.277
doctor. Rank in supposedly

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:08.811
helping out Michael on the

01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:12.214
floor here it made us sick.

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:14.183
Because I don't know what his

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.352
intentions are and we don't

01:09:16.418 --> 01:09:16.919
know what the whole health

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.621
department intentions are the

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:20.256
news pulling their strings so

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:22.391
seeing that guy here was. Very

01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:28.364
disturbing. That your guys job

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.931
to figure the best thing the

01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:30.666
hell out. You gonna grow all

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:32.768
these agencies but it's your

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.470
job to regulate these

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:36.605
regulators so do it thank you.

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:40.543
Thank you. Thank you for

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:42.645
Matthews number the board of

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:46.315
say Porter ranch and I'm also a

01:09:46.382 --> 01:09:48.384
member of the executive board

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.286
and legislation committee of

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:50.853
the California Democratic

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.655
Party. On behalf of them I

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:54.623
would like to remind you that

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.392
the state party platform calls

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:58.594
for the immediate shutdown of

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:02.331
this facility and I would hope.

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:04.600
I would hope that all of our

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:06.468
democratic legislators would be

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.069
listening to the state party

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:10.306
platform. I want to thank the

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:10.940
legislators who are here thank

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:14.343
you so much for being here I

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.378
noticed that all of you who are

01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:18.380
here are local and you are

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:20.449
those. Who have been hearing

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:22.318
again again about all of our

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:24.320
pain and many of you have

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:24.954
experienced some of that paying

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:28.324
yourself and- really appreciate

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.991
the support that you have given

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.793
us. But I'm also very

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.528
disappointed that we don't have

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.330
legislators from around the

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:36.532
state here to listen to us they

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.400
are the ones who haven't heard

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:40.636
our pain. They haven't heard

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:42.705
all these problems all of these

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:44.440
stories that all these people

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:46.375
have. And hearing that there is

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:48.444
not a single person here who is

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.412
calling for keeping this

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:50.980
facility open it's gonna be

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:54.650
shut down. I had a forty year

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:56.452
career as an engineer. Working

01:10:56.518 --> 01:11:00.522
with toxic materials serving on

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:02.491
company safety teams. And it's

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:04.693
obvious to me as an engineer

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.562
that this facility never should

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:08.597
have been re opened it's a

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:10.532
basic engineering principle.

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:12.568
But when you have a major

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:14.603
product failure you don't start

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.705
to deliver that product again.

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.741
Until you've done the root

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:20.542
cause analysis and you've

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.478
demonstrated that every single

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:22.978
item in that root cause

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:26.415
analysis. You have a draft and

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.417
we didn't do that and when the

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:29.084
root cause analysis came out we

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:30.653
saw that there were a whole lot

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:32.488
of unaddressed problems. And

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.490
yet the facility keeps

01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:36.525
operating and we cannot allow

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:38.594
that. Never should have re

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:39.161
opened we got a close it as

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:40.629
soon as we can. One of the most

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:42.798
important things in the root

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:44.533
cause analysis that I see. Is

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.735
it mentioning that the gas

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.837
company has a lack of a safety

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:52.474
culture. And that really is the

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:54.576
root cause of all of the other

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:56.645
root causes so we really have

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:58.580
to get out that. The report

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.916
says that there really isn't

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.751
any documentation that shows a

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:04.820
safety culture. And that really

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:06.655
should be emphasized a lot more

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:08.457
than what's in the report

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:08.924
because that lack of

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.626
documentation is itself proof

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:12.828
of the lack of safety culture.

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.763
As an example in my work on

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:16.865
safety teams we're going around

01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:18.734
we saw worker had a bottle of

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:22.438
water to clean parts at times.

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.506
And we wrote that up because it

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.542
didn't say water on the bottle

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:27.176
and if somebody else came along

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:30.679
and accidentally spilled that

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:31.246
bottle they wouldn't know if

01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:32.481
they still something hazardous.

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:33.115
We wrote up reports and we did

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.683
that because you need to have

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:35.284
the documentation of all these

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:38.721
things you can do. Measure them

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:40.456
against all of your metric see

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:41.023
if your metrics are actually

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:42.624
providing the safety you need.

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.793
Improve your process sees based

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.829
on that and without the

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:48.597
documentation the gas company

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:49.264
has not been doing anything to

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:50.933
its improve its processes. And

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:52.868
this is been going on year

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:56.605
after year after year. Another

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:58.607
example is the material safety

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:00.709
data sheets these are required

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:02.544
by OSHA and other agencies so

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:04.546
that when you have a spill. You

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:06.615
know immediately what are the

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:08.550
hazards what what effect is

01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:09.184
this can have on people you can

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:10.886
notify all the people who. Were

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.855
exposed what it is they were

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.890
exposed to and what they need

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:16.759
to do about it. And what

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:18.460
happened after this blow out

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:19.128
was the gas company kept saying

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:22.564
there's nothing toxic here that

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:23.165
it's perfectly safe you don't

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:26.635
have to worry about. But the

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:27.202
gas was old arise with math

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:27.836
former captain and the material

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:28.837
safety data sheet for mark

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:30.873
captain rates the health risk

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:34.810
as four out of for. The highest

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:36.678
risk in sales long term

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:38.781
exposure causes lung damage and

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:42.484
all of us here. Have long term

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:44.887
exposure during the many months

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:46.688
of this blow out. They were

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:47.222
lying to us they were not

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:48.991
following the procedures that

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:49.525
are they are following the

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:52.795
documentation. The root cause

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:54.797
analysis also notes that

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:56.799
they've been reactive rather

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:58.767
than proactive it documents a

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:00.969
long history of accident after

01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:02.938
action after accident all they

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:04.807
ever do is they fix that

01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:06.842
immediate problem and they've

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:08.710
never looked at the bigger

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:09.378
problem why do they keep having

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:12.514
a weekly leaks. They need to be

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:13.081
addressing the bigger thing

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:14.883
being proactive to deal with

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.819
all of this. A gelling sample

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:18.754
that this goes way back to the

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:19.354
very beginning this facility

01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:20.989
opened as a gas storage

01:14:21.056 --> 01:14:22.825
facility in nineteen seventy

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:24.693
three. The very next year we

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.762
had a massive blow out and fire

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:28.964
that went on and on forever and

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:30.799
the gas company had no idea how

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:33.168
to put out the fire they had to

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:34.670
bring in. Famous oil fire

01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:38.874
fighter reddit dear to common

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.709
to put out the fire for them.

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:42.911
And forty years later they

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:43.478
still haven't learned those

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:43.979
lessons. And so we need

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:46.515
legislation that addresses

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:48.650
safety very specifically thank.

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:54.523
Thank you. Few last sentences

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:55.090
we need to have legislation

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:56.992
that says that natural gas may

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:58.861
not be stored at an unsafe

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:02.631
natural gas storage facility

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:03.265
that should go without saying

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.766
how could you not to say

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.768
something like that it's so

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:07.402
obvious yet we don't actually

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:09.204
have that in the law. We should

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:11.039
define the natural gas storage

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:14.643
facility shall be deemed unsafe

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:15.310
if in the life of the facility

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:18.714
it is weak more than a ton of

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.682
gas yeah that's basically the

01:15:20.749 --> 01:15:22.684
death penalty for a facility if

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.620
you get up to that level you've

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:25.187
had so many weeks that it's

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:26.855
added up to that much chaos.

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:28.690
Then you should be operating at

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:30.692
all we didn't leak one ton of

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:34.796
gas we leaked a. Hundred

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:35.364
thousand tons of gas during

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:38.934
this blow out. Facility should

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:40.903
be deemed unsafe for the

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:41.536
facility uses wells the pierced

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:42.771
the plane of an active. Seismic

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:45.073
fault. This is the two of them

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.942
the fall because the magnitude

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:47.509
six point seven Northridge

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:48.877
earthquake. The fault to

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:51.213
produce the magnitude six point

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.948
seven silmar earthquake both

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:54.917
faults come and join right

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:56.785
under this facility passed

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:58.654
straight through these wells.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.254
And we've been warned that if

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:00.722
there's another earthquake on

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:01.356
those faults they could slice

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:02.991
right through them. We can have

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:04.960
a blow out a hundred times as

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:06.929
big as this. And finally the

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:08.764
facility should be deemed

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.732
unsafe if it does not use

01:16:10.799 --> 01:16:12.868
subsurface safety valves they

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.836
took out the valves that they

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.772
had they refused to put them in

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:17.205
because they're too

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:18.941
inconvenient. Well our health

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:24.713
is not an inconvenience. To

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:25.314
shut it down and out thank you

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:30.652
thank you. Okay lastly welcome

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:31.253
okay my name is ed bath I've

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.021
been in since here since two

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:33.588
thousand one I have a very

01:16:33.655 --> 01:16:35.057
simple question that I think

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:38.660
most people here to find out

01:16:38.727 --> 01:16:40.796
and that is does the gas

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:42.898
company answer to the state or

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:43.465
does the state answer to the

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:46.935
gas company. That's why we

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:49.237
here. That's the Gansu were

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:50.973
trying to find out what all the

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:53.041
complications. That's the

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:54.710
answer would like to come out.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:17:02.918
Who answers to who. Well let me

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:06.855
answer it on. A personal note

01:17:06.922 --> 01:17:10.926
it is I answer to you. And we

01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:14.863
work for you. And the

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.898
government its job is to rein

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:20.869
in corporate power when it is

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:22.771
in excess and so. This

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:25.240
suffering in this community is

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.908
going through which we just

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:29.211
heard in stark detail this

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:29.778
morning is the reason we're

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:33.115
here. There been failures not

01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:34.750
just at the gas company but

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:36.785
truly within government itself.

01:17:36.852 --> 01:17:37.352
And for that we all have to

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:41.023
take responsibility. You know

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:41.656
my opening remark today is just

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:44.926
gonna be that. I answers to

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:45.527
questions are not going to be

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:52.934
enough. We need results. And. I

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.870
agree with that the testimony

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:57.072
this morning that a lease so

01:17:57.139 --> 01:18:02.911
canyon needs to be shut down.

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:08.884
That decision. Will be decided

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:10.819
by the public utilities

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:11.486
commission in the coming months

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:15.057
in it in the preceding operated

01:18:15.123 --> 01:18:17.059
under is Senate bill that I

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:19.194
wrote for then senator Fran

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:21.029
Pavley Senate bill three eighty

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:22.798
and they're currently studying

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:24.800
the quote unquote feasibility

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:25.434
of operating without a lease so

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:29.104
canyon. But your gas company

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:31.106
your public utility certainly

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:34.843
does not want that to occur.

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:35.343
This is a very valuable

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:37.112
formation that is generated

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:39.147
hundreds of millions if not

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:40.849
billions of dollars in profit.

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:43.151
And so one of the central

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:43.785
questions we're gonna be trying

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:46.955
to drive towards today. Is if

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:49.124
that indeed is such a

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:50.892
profitable facility that the

01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:51.493
shareholders benefit from why

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.896
not the shareholders cover the

01:18:54.963 --> 01:18:56.865
cost. Of that facility as well.

01:18:56.932 --> 01:19:01.369
So. The root cause analysis was

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:02.971
required under Senate bill

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.073
three eighty as well as a

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:05.607
number of other emergency

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:09.077
response plans. That will be

01:19:09.144 --> 01:19:09.644
exploring in further detail

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:14.816
here today. But the question

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:15.350
that will be crucial goes

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:18.920
beyond this room it is not just

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:20.822
a matter of the people in here

01:19:20.889 --> 01:19:21.356
suffering but is the rate

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.058
payers of all of southern

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.160
California whose pocket books

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:26.995
are on the line. With the

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:27.629
decision pending for the public

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:30.899
utilities commission. If the

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:31.366
public feel utilities

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.068
commission finds that the gas

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:35.137
company in the decades of

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:37.005
operation of this field was

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:38.940
prudent. And reasonable. They

01:19:39.007 --> 01:19:41.109
can pass that cost. Almost a

01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:45.046
billion dollars now. On to the

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:47.182
rate payers beyond Porter ranch

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:48.884
to all of southern California.

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.952
And I guarantee you they'd like

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:53.155
to do so based on their initial

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:53.722
comments back to the public

01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:55.123
utilities commission. The

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.092
alternative path. Is that if

01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:59.094
they were found to have been

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:01.229
imprudent or beyond imprudence.

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:05.033
Reckless knowingly disregarding

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:07.335
a foreseeable risk that pipes

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:11.006
corrode. Which I think you'll

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:11.640
all realize after hearing some

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:13.208
testimony today that doesn't

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:17.012
take an engineer. Or a

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:17.646
geologist understand that pipes

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:21.283
corrode over time. If that was

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:23.051
a foreseeable risk that was

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:25.253
either ignored. Or knowingly

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.957
acknowledged and set aside and

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:29.524
that costs cannot be passed

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.293
through to the rate payers of

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:33.094
southern California and the gas

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:35.130
companies rate payers I mean

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:35.730
shareholders need to take that

01:20:35.797 --> 01:20:38.900
bill. They'll say they don't

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:39.534
have the balance sheet to do so

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:41.236
but backing them is one of the

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:43.038
largest corporations in the

01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:45.373
nation Sempra energy. And

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.275
Sampras been using this field

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.411
for years as not just a way to

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:51.446
deliver retail gas supply to

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:54.950
your stoves in your heaters but

01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:56.952
also as a hedging strategy. To

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:59.054
improve their stock market

01:20:59.120 --> 01:20:59.554
rating by finding price

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:02.891
disparity so that they buy low

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:03.458
and sell high just like any

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.093
other company would. The

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.262
problem is that it's in your

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:11.066
backyard. And it's in all of

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:11.666
our backyard and I don't think

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.034
we can afford that risk. We ran

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:15.203
legislation the first year I

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.272
entered office to close that

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:19.007
facility Senate bill fifty

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:21.276
seven. Made failed on the

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:23.211
Senate floor so to the

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:25.080
testimony regarding the need

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:27.148
for other legislators in the

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:27.716
state of California to hear

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:29.484
your voices I couldn't agree

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:31.353
more. So lonely fight in

01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:35.190
Sacramento sometimes and there

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:35.824
are many threats that they'll

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.158
take away your still at the

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:39.461
drive up your bills hundreds of

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:41.296
dollars by closing this

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:43.098
facility well tell you it's

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:45.033
fear. That's not reality the

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.068
technology exists today. To

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:51.106
move ourselves pass gas. To a

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:51.706
future that we can live for a

01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:57.145
100% renewable energy. And I

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:59.014
wanna thank. I want to thank

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.049
governor Newsome to start. I

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:03.018
will be going to his secretary

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:03.585
was recently appointed and

01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:05.353
confirmed by the Senate. The

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:07.222
new secretary the California

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:09.124
natural resources agency Wade

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:11.192
crowfoot. But this governor

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:13.395
himself who I've spoken to as

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:15.030
many of you have personally.

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:15.664
Has committed to the closure of

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:19.200
a lease so can you. Now the

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:19.734
question is how to follow

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:23.138
through on that commitment. And

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:25.273
how to overcome the political

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:29.110
forces in his way. I know you

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:29.778
all stand with him and we do as

01:22:29.844 --> 01:22:33.048
well. But here today we're

01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:33.615
going to be focusing on this

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:37.185
root cause analysis. Of the

01:22:37.252 --> 01:22:41.222
leak itself. And why. Why that

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:43.124
was allowed for decades to

01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:45.226
continue as it was. So first

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:47.195
off we're gonna ask US

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:49.431
secretary crowfoot to open up

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:53.301
with testimony. And then we're

01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:55.203
going to move on to Robbie

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:57.205
Krishna mercy who led the blade

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:59.040
energy partners independence

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:01.042
root cause analysis as required

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:03.244
by law. And lastly will have

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:05.246
Jason Marshall here with who's

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:07.115
the deputy director of the

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:07.582
California department

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:09.517
conservation who is overseeing

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:13.221
dog at the time of. The blow

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:15.223
out as well as under. Current

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:17.125
law. So without further ado

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:19.227
secretary crowfoot I do want

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:21.262
you all to know that he himself

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:25.266
suggested that. We offer a

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:27.068
little bit different order this

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:29.070
morning and I know it's been a-

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:31.539
a re shuffling but to hear from

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:35.076
you first. He's been through

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:37.145
this too so we appreciate you

01:23:37.212 --> 01:23:39.080
making the trip. And we know

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:41.449
the lift is large but please

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:43.284
secretary crowfoot will light

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:45.353
up with your testimony then

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.255
respond questions they answer

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:47.889
thanks so much senator stern.

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:51.092
Assembly members let me just

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:51.760
first acknowledge you know what

01:23:51.826 --> 01:23:53.528
is clearly anger fear and

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:55.463
frustration from residents here

01:23:55.530 --> 01:24:01.136
today. I think the message that.

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:03.271
You know your community need to

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:05.173
delve to lever has been

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.409
delivered and I do think it was

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:08.009
helpful to have the context of

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:11.146
public comment first. I

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:13.448
remember those a hundred eleven

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:15.450
days well but very differently

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:17.452
than you do. I work for

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.154
governor news governor brown at

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.423
the time in in our office I was

01:24:21.489 --> 01:24:25.193
our point person interacting

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:25.760
with the agencies that were.

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:29.330
Working to. Stop the leak. I'm

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:31.399
so I came down here quite a bit

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:33.535
but I came down here I got on

01:24:33.601 --> 01:24:34.202
the plane came down here this

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:37.372
was your backyard. Now you live

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:39.207
this for a hundred eleven days.

01:24:39.274 --> 01:24:41.209
I have a five year old daughter

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:43.445
now. And we lived in Oakland.

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:45.580
This summer I when we're

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:47.682
dealing with the pretty toxic

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:51.319
fire wildfire smoke. And had to

01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:53.421
get her the end ninety five

01:24:53.488 --> 01:24:53.955
mask and I remember being.

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:55.657
Really cared about her spending

01:24:55.723 --> 01:24:57.492
too much time outdoors. I can

01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:59.527
only imagine what it was like

01:24:59.594 --> 01:25:01.396
to have the apparent at that

01:25:01.463 --> 01:25:03.565
time. Omits confusion a lack of

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:07.469
information and concerns about

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:09.471
your health. I and your kids

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:11.339
health so I just want to

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:13.208
acknowledge that. What we've

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.210
been asked to do. Here today is

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:15.810
talk about the set of actions

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:19.314
that's taken place since. You

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.282
know almost four years ago and

01:25:21.349 --> 01:25:23.351
we're going to do that. But as

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:25.587
we get into the tedium of the

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:27.255
root cause analysis at cetera.

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:27.789
Just know that we get the

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:31.226
larger point which is your

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:31.793
fundamental dissatisfaction

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:32.327
with the actions that have

01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:35.497
taken place. Now I believe

01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:36.064
actually that many of the

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:37.599
actions that have taken place

01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:39.567
including these regulations

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:41.369
that past overseeing natural

01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:43.371
gas facilities in October

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:45.240
twenty eighteen are strong.

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:45.673
Some of it we have

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.308
characterized them as as

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:49.210
stronger than any other state

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:49.844
but again I want to acknowledge

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:51.546
where you come from which is

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:55.216
that's not enough and at least.

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:57.385
Help you understand that that

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:59.254
we understand your position.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:03.291
I'm happy to opine on on the

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:03.892
root cause analysis any we'll

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:05.560
hear from experts I'll also

01:26:05.627 --> 01:26:09.664
just mention. The priority that

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:11.332
I know you all share with

01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:11.799
governor Newsome Diddy

01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:13.601
carbonized our economy and

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:15.370
reduce our dependence on fossil

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:15.970
fuel. I think he said it you

01:26:16.037 --> 01:26:19.607
know we were at a- oil seepage

01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:21.643
in Bakersfield just two weeks

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:23.711
ago with the governor and the

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:25.547
governor was really clear in

01:26:25.613 --> 01:26:27.482
the middle of the you know I'm

01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:29.450
oil field that. You know we

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:31.352
believe that California's

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:33.388
energy future is a D.

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:34.022
carbonized future where reduce

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:35.690
dependence on fossil fuels so

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:37.592
we're all moving in that

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:39.327
direction. We want to move in

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:39.961
that direction the question is

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:41.596
what's the pathway. And that's

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:45.500
really I think the meat of what

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:47.535
you know senator stern you're

01:26:47.602 --> 01:26:48.169
working on as it relates to the

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:51.306
future of this facility. So

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.341
I'll stop there and then I can

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:53.942
respond as as helpful to the

01:26:54.008 --> 01:26:55.710
testimony provided. Will come

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:57.478
back to you with further

01:26:57.545 --> 01:26:59.414
questions and allowed the

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.416
continuation the testimony. Mr

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:03.418
Krishnamoorthy do you want to

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:03.918
proceed next I believe a

01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:05.453
presentation for us as well.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:13.561
Okay thank you Sir. Just push

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:14.128
the button yeah sorry about

01:27:14.195 --> 01:27:17.699
that. Our. Thank you at thank

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:21.436
you for having me here. I'm

01:27:21.502 --> 01:27:22.036
going to be very technical in

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:27.442
this talk we will retain that

01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:29.377
in ended January twenty sixteen.

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:31.512
Val was to leaking at that

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:33.414
point when we came on site. And

01:27:33.481 --> 01:27:35.550
there was a large demon blade

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:37.452
dad that was working on it four

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:39.520
of my colleagues here bill

01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:40.121
Randy Nigel and Greg are with

01:27:40.188 --> 01:27:43.558
me here today. This was a long

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:45.693
process for us it took us

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.597
nearly. Three and a half years

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:50.198
and hopefully I can go to the

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:51.666
next slide. Yum it took us

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.768
nearly three and a half years

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:55.837
night it took a lot of support

01:27:55.903 --> 01:27:57.505
from a lot of different groups

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:59.741
and I want to. Acknowledge Cebu

01:27:59.807 --> 01:28:03.378
seein Dogger. We were tasked

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.480
the scope that was given to us

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:07.482
was independent root cause

01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:09.384
analysis independence to us

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:09.984
means something. It means no

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:13.388
influence from anybody. And as

01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:14.022
C. Pusey in dog are rare fully

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:15.623
supportive of that day's

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:17.659
supported us in any logistical

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:19.594
requirements. Through the

01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:21.596
process. We had no input our-

01:28:21.663 --> 01:28:25.433
our ad no nobody gives any

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:26.000
directions in which to take

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:29.404
this project and similarly I

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:30.004
would like to acknowledge so

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:31.873
cal gas. They did two things

01:28:31.939 --> 01:28:33.908
they also provided us complete

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:35.576
independence. Number two will

01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:36.110
be as you can see from the

01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:37.845
report which I'll discuss in a

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:39.580
few minutes. There is an

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:41.749
inordinate amount of data we

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:43.384
collected data we treat it

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:45.386
quite so cal support and more

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:45.953
importantly we had to get

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:51.626
physical evidence. At that was

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:52.226
essential to any conclusion we

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:55.630
could make. So I would like to

01:28:55.697 --> 01:28:56.197
acknowledge so cal gas and

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:57.632
lastly there were twenty three

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:58.199
service companies that work

01:28:58.266 --> 01:28:58.800
with us for the last three and

01:28:58.866 --> 01:28:59.534
a half years. And I'll go

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.168
through the work and hopefully

01:29:00.234 --> 01:29:01.803
it gives you a flavor for white

01:29:01.869 --> 01:29:03.504
took us so long and. And

01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:05.807
hopefully it was it was a

01:29:05.873 --> 01:29:06.340
valuable insight into what

01:29:06.407 --> 01:29:09.410
happened. Any root cause

01:29:09.477 --> 01:29:09.944
analysis is a systematic

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.846
process you cannot just jump in

01:29:11.913 --> 01:29:15.616
and collect data. You start

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:17.552
interpreting so we developed a

01:29:17.618 --> 01:29:19.420
phased approach we discussed

01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:21.656
with all the parties we started

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:23.558
with data collection we didn't

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:24.125
want anything of the site

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:27.562
touched which was phase one we

01:29:27.628 --> 01:29:28.162
wanted to once the weather was

01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:29.597
successfully controlled.

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:31.799
Controlled was turned over to

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:32.366
see if you see and then no

01:29:32.433 --> 01:29:33.735
action was taken out on

01:29:33.801 --> 01:29:35.770
location without blades and put

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.672
on the blades it no nobody

01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:39.407
could move anything on location

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:41.676
without our input so. We rent

01:29:41.743 --> 01:29:43.778
in phase one we went to the

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:45.747
site collected lots of whatever

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:47.749
information we could we ran

01:29:47.815 --> 01:29:49.517
some what we call at that point

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:50.184
there was a crater many of you

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.586
remember there was a crater we

01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:53.821
ran some what we call to bring

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.523
logs the latest technology.

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:56.057
That is available in the

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:57.892
industry across the globe to

01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:59.861
figure out what may have

01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:01.929
happened before we did anything

01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:03.531
to the location that was phase

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:05.800
one. Phase two was filling up

01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:07.702
the crater phase three was

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:09.737
pulling everything out putting

01:30:09.804 --> 01:30:13.574
everything out sounds simple.

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:14.175
But for our conclusions to be

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:19.747
made today. We had to get

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:20.348
everything in pristine form if

01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:20.982
anything is damaged. I it's no

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:21.682
different than any

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:22.350
investigation you have to have.

01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:23.618
Everything together to

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:25.620
interpret anything recognizing.

01:30:25.686 --> 01:30:26.220
Well was flying for a hundred

01:30:26.287 --> 01:30:28.022
and fourteen days or something.

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.824
They were killed Floyd's pumped

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:30.458
in Munich at night all of that

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:31.926
but still we wanted to and

01:30:31.993 --> 01:30:32.493
that's Pristina form as we

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.961
could. And then the last two

01:30:34.028 --> 01:30:37.965
phases was analyzing the data

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:39.667
combining the information. Oops

01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:41.969
okay now I want everybody to

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:43.671
this is an important slide I

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:44.272
think it's on the monitor and

01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:45.873
it's here there are three or

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.842
four things in an oil well or a

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:51.546
gas well this is pretty normal

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:52.213
the first thing I want to point

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.648
out is that it's a small thing

01:30:53.714 --> 01:30:55.783
called surface casing which

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:57.652
goes to nine ninety feet that

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:58.219
is eleven and three quarter

01:30:58.286 --> 01:30:59.887
inch that was partially

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:01.823
cemented in nineteen fifty

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:03.825
four. When the pump see meant

01:31:03.891 --> 01:31:04.492
and this is common to all of us

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:05.993
in a lease so you lose see

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:11.666
meant that set and apps. The

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:12.266
sea meant was pretty ratty in

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:15.670
poor condition. And then there

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:17.572
is the next biggest of pipe or

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:18.206
OR casing that runs it's called

01:31:18.272 --> 01:31:18.873
the seven inch casing. And what

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:19.807
you will notice at the bottom

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:20.441
there's a shaded area it is

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:22.043
seem ended up to seven thousand

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:23.945
feet. At the bottom. And then

01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:25.813
about that is what we call

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.715
drilling mud. This was not

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:28.282
uncommon practice is quite

01:31:28.349 --> 01:31:29.951
common in those days. Even

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:31.886
today many roles are drilled

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:33.654
and completed this way. And

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:34.222
there's drilling mud all the

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:35.857
way to the top. Okay and then

01:31:35.923 --> 01:31:37.825
come inside and then the

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:39.794
smallest pipe there that's the

01:31:39.861 --> 01:31:41.596
tubing. Two and seven eights.

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:43.664
When it was an oil well. The

01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:47.768
tubing was used for. Producing

01:31:47.835 --> 01:31:49.837
pumping oil. In nineteen

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:51.706
seventy three when the world

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:52.306
was converted to gas storage.

01:31:52.373 --> 01:31:53.808
You'll see the last to add the

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:55.610
expanded port that there is a

01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:56.244
parked there. We had gas would

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:58.012
come from there is a water into

01:31:58.079 --> 01:31:59.914
the tubing and from the tubing

01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:01.616
get into the seven inch casing.

01:32:01.682 --> 01:32:03.751
And come all the way to. And

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:04.318
you needed that FOR William

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:05.953
William reasons. They were

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.788
producing through the tubing

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.590
and through the casing that was

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:11.759
the- modus operandi and this is

01:32:11.826 --> 01:32:13.761
the operational style all over

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:15.730
the U. S. US for gas twenty

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:19.600
twelve this is not uncommon.

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:20.201
This is not unique to lease or

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:23.871
California. Okay the most

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:24.472
important thing to know about

01:32:24.538 --> 01:32:25.773
SS twenty five was. Regulations

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.608
required noise and temperature

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:28.175
logs I'll touch on it in a

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:29.944
little bit later. But there

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:31.612
were no leaks or failures in SS

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:32.113
twenty five there is no

01:32:32.179 --> 01:32:33.714
indication of anything

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:34.282
happening ever on this is

01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:38.052
twenty five. There were other

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:38.686
was that had problems will talk

01:32:38.753 --> 01:32:39.887
about that in a minute. But the

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:41.722
I've broken this discussion

01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:42.290
into three portions. I will

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:44.158
first talk about the failure

01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:46.060
itself then I will talk about

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:47.895
what happened after the

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:49.730
failure. And then lastly I'll

01:32:49.797 --> 01:32:51.866
talk about how the Elise canyon

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:55.770
was managed as a facility. So

01:32:55.836 --> 01:32:56.470
let's look at the office twenty

01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:58.005
five failure this is the

01:32:58.072 --> 01:32:58.606
condition under which we got

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:01.609
the well on. Middle of February

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:03.878
twenty sixteen. This is what

01:33:03.945 --> 01:33:04.445
you will see at the bottom

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:06.080
right about there is a word

01:33:06.147 --> 01:33:07.615
that is seen meant the weather

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:09.784
was controlled it was. It was

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.786
captain no no gas was coming

01:33:11.852 --> 01:33:13.854
anywhere it was safe to get

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:14.488
into the well another well. And

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:16.057
then I point out things and

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:18.159
read there which are the metal

01:33:18.225 --> 01:33:21.862
lost locations. And the one on

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:24.098
top at about eight hundred and

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:25.733
ninety feet to be interpreted

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.300
at that point was the main

01:33:26.367 --> 01:33:28.102
failure so we knew where the

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:30.137
failure once. So everything we

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:32.073
did after that operationally

01:33:32.139 --> 01:33:32.707
was important to protect that

01:33:32.773 --> 01:33:35.810
location. Anything we did it

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:37.878
internally we talked a hundred

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:39.947
times acted ones. So we went

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:41.849
through a lot of detail work

01:33:41.916 --> 01:33:43.784
there. So I'm gonna jump a

01:33:43.851 --> 01:33:46.087
recognizing my time limit here

01:33:46.153 --> 01:33:49.757
on the right side is that

01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:50.424
option itself that shows on the

01:33:50.491 --> 01:33:51.993
left hand side of that right

01:33:52.059 --> 01:33:53.761
side is a picture. That shows

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:54.362
how the seven inch casing was

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:56.197
was broken up. There are two

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:57.965
things to notice about that

01:33:58.032 --> 01:34:00.167
first is there is a failure of

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:01.836
better let that is running up

01:34:01.902 --> 01:34:02.436
and down and I use the word

01:34:02.503 --> 01:34:04.138
axial ruptured to describe

01:34:04.205 --> 01:34:07.775
that. Then you will see

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:11.812
something broken up second.

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:12.446
Financially we call that second

01:34:12.513 --> 01:34:17.985
financial parting. Axial

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:18.619
rupture circumferential parting

01:34:18.686 --> 01:34:20.121
the moment we see this at the

01:34:20.187 --> 01:34:20.788
bottom it's bunched axially. So

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:21.288
I know immediately that

01:34:21.355 --> 01:34:22.156
happened first. So a lot of

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:23.791
things you can you can infer

01:34:23.858 --> 01:34:24.358
from looking just looking at

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:24.992
the piece you can say Hey that

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:27.862
happen first. When you look

01:34:27.928 --> 01:34:28.496
closely there is some corrosion

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:29.830
on the ordeal of the seven inch.

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:30.464
Not recognize the seven inches

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:33.801
ciment at seven thousand feet.

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:35.970
About that it's a drilling mud.

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:38.172
Drilling mud normally when you

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:39.974
put there from a drilling

01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:40.574
practice point if it's what we

01:34:40.641 --> 01:34:44.045
call high PH. Which was not

01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:44.678
corrode corrosion should not be

01:34:44.745 --> 01:34:47.882
a problem conventionally. Okay

01:34:47.948 --> 01:34:50.017
so the let's let's look at this

01:34:50.084 --> 01:34:50.584
a little bit more carefully.

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:54.088
Yes now I am focusing in on

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:56.057
zooming in on that axial

01:34:56.123 --> 01:34:57.858
rupture where we believe the

01:34:57.925 --> 01:34:59.960
failure origin native. And what

01:35:00.027 --> 01:35:01.862
you will notice there. Is

01:35:01.929 --> 01:35:03.798
technically it's a very

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:06.000
interesting feature there are

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:06.600
what we call grooves that are

01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:07.968
running axially. And then

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:09.904
they'd look at its like

01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:10.471
fractals its grooves within

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:12.206
grooves it's very unusual form

01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:14.075
of corrosion. There is very

01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:16.043
little to normal literature on

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:18.179
this type of this this the way

01:35:18.245 --> 01:35:20.247
it looks then when you look at

01:35:20.314 --> 01:35:22.083
that small piece there that are

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:24.318
smaller tunnels that are. That

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:26.020
are made into the metal. Of

01:35:26.087 --> 01:35:28.222
course we suspected microbial

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:29.890
corrosion we validated as

01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:30.458
microbial corrosion at that

01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:32.226
point. And it is discussed in

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:36.330
the report. So that corrosion

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:38.132
there that that wall that pain

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:41.902
285% it was about two point one

01:35:41.969 --> 01:35:43.804
three inches long that area.

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:44.405
And on the morning of October

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:47.808
twenty third. Sometime after

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.977
three to four AM that drop

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:51.812
trick that failed and that

01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:53.948
resulted in that. That cracked

01:35:54.014 --> 01:35:56.083
it is running in this gets up

01:35:56.150 --> 01:35:58.018
and down I'm showing it flat is

01:35:58.085 --> 01:35:58.652
running left to right after.

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:00.087
That ruptured that the event

01:36:00.154 --> 01:36:02.123
was the first event okay we

01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:04.258
looked at all the all the data

01:36:04.325 --> 01:36:06.293
that we got that we carefully

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.262
collected. We could interpret

01:36:08.329 --> 01:36:10.297
that happened and then it

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:10.898
stopped that happen at some

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:14.068
point stopped. Next gas was

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:16.103
leaking through that rupture

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:18.205
area and I'll come to the

01:36:18.272 --> 01:36:20.007
quantity of gas. And then it

01:36:20.074 --> 01:36:22.042
split second financially now

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:23.944
why can I say that I can say

01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.980
that because there is very

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:27.982
little plasticity there. I know

01:36:28.048 --> 01:36:29.917
the metal was extremely cold we

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.952
calculated the temperature that

01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:32.586
it called to metallurgical Lee

01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:36.023
and modeling lice. So we're

01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:36.624
comfortable saying that's the

01:36:36.690 --> 01:36:40.094
second round. So there is

01:36:40.161 --> 01:36:42.062
strictly speaking to separate

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:42.596
events that combined and

01:36:42.663 --> 01:36:44.265
because this. All of this we

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:48.002
believe happened on. October

01:36:48.068 --> 01:36:50.004
twenty third sometime after

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:52.006
three thirty in the morning we

01:36:52.072 --> 01:36:52.573
believe the circumferential

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.275
rupture happen sometime around

01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:56.143
seven AM at eight AM and then

01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:56.710
the next one happened couple

01:36:56.777 --> 01:37:06.153
hours prior. So I'm I'm jumping

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:06.687
to the conclusions of the

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:08.322
report so there if you can

01:37:08.389 --> 01:37:12.293
follow me one two three four

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:14.128
five wonder prisons nineteen

01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:14.628
nineteen fifty four the

01:37:14.695 --> 01:37:16.297
drilling fluid is there there

01:37:16.363 --> 01:37:16.864
is not corrosion sh nothing

01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:18.032
should grow at that point it

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:20.201
was well designed go to number

01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:22.236
two or punitive time this is

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:24.205
higher density marred it drops

01:37:24.271 --> 01:37:26.373
it leaks off it is replaced by

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.342
migrating groundwater in step

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:30.344
three. This groundwater had

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:32.379
microbes in it whether it

01:37:32.446 --> 01:37:34.381
collected microbes are microbes

01:37:34.448 --> 01:37:38.185
grew with it it grew. Over time

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:42.089
it corroded and four and five.

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:44.158
And what I'm not talked about

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:44.792
up to note is that eleven and

01:37:44.858 --> 01:37:46.060
three quarter inch also had did

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:46.660
not have good seem and there

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:47.228
was water outside. That also

01:37:47.294 --> 01:37:49.997
corroded. Which which was.

01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:52.333
Which was one of the reasons

01:37:52.399 --> 01:37:52.900
that the well was blowing on

01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:54.134
surface the way below. So we

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:56.337
had a pretty clear idea how the

01:37:56.403 --> 01:37:58.205
corrosion happened. Let me look

01:37:58.272 --> 01:37:58.839
at the time and this time line

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:00.407
was at a very important to us

01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:02.343
because- at that point we

01:38:02.409 --> 01:38:04.144
didn't know whether they- are

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:06.113
one of the suspicions we had

01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:08.249
which was wrong it was that the

01:38:08.315 --> 01:38:08.882
killer temps cost things to get

01:38:08.949 --> 01:38:11.986
worse. And the way we concluded

01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:12.653
that will but I'd your physical

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.421
and actual data. Is what I'm

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:16.223
showing you here is the

01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:16.724
pressure data from the

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:18.292
compressors called injection

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:20.527
header. It's about a thousand

01:38:20.594 --> 01:38:22.162
feet approximately from SS

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:24.431
twenty five. And the blue line

01:38:24.498 --> 01:38:26.200
is pressure at about two PM on

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:28.435
October twenty second they shut

01:38:28.502 --> 01:38:30.304
off injection to SS twenty

01:38:30.371 --> 01:38:32.139
five. And I know that because

01:38:32.206 --> 01:38:34.141
the pressure drop from twenty

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:34.742
eight hundred to about twenty

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:36.277
seven eighty PSI dropped. No I

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:38.345
know I didn't fail during that

01:38:38.412 --> 01:38:40.014
shut off that shut off period

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:40.648
from two PM in of doctor would

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:42.149
twenty second October twenty

01:38:42.216 --> 01:38:44.218
third. Because if twenty five

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:46.153
failed that pressure would have

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:46.754
dropped down to five hundred

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.422
PSI. So I nor did not fail

01:38:48.489 --> 01:38:52.192
them. Then at three between

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:52.826
three and four AM they started

01:38:52.893 --> 01:38:54.361
injection back so you can see

01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:56.297
it's back to about. Twenty

01:38:56.363 --> 01:38:58.132
eight LBS I so I know very

01:38:58.198 --> 01:39:00.134
clearly. That it did not happen

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.303
until. After three or four AM

01:39:02.369 --> 01:39:04.004
in the morning of October

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:06.340
twenty third. Now I want we

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:08.409
want to do is to tighten up the

01:39:08.475 --> 01:39:10.177
time a little bit more. You

01:39:10.244 --> 01:39:12.246
look at the red line that is

01:39:12.313 --> 01:39:14.081
the temperature now I know the

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:16.116
mosquitos cord and it split

01:39:16.183 --> 01:39:18.319
second financially. So I know

01:39:18.385 --> 01:39:20.187
that circumstantial split has

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:22.556
to happen basin the temperature

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:26.193
we physically estimated and

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:28.295
modeling estimated. That the

01:39:28.362 --> 01:39:32.132
gas temperature was ready court

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:34.335
at that point and that happened

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:36.537
between seven to eight AM in

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:40.274
the morning so we know seven to

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:42.176
eight PM with the second

01:39:42.242 --> 01:39:44.244
version of the rapture. An hour

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:44.778
before would have been the

01:39:44.845 --> 01:39:48.515
axial rupture. So what happened

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:50.184
when the doctor happen this

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:50.818
happen sometime in the morning.

01:39:50.884 --> 01:39:52.219
Sometime let's say six seven.

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:54.221
It's an estimate it's not exact

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:54.855
but we're pretty confident that

01:39:54.922 --> 01:39:55.389
sometime in that period it

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:56.457
happened. So I'm showing you

01:39:56.523 --> 01:39:56.924
two lines here. And we

01:39:56.990 --> 01:40:00.427
calculated in the. Hi leave at

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:04.198
that that are fracture so the

01:40:04.264 --> 01:40:04.798
formation can absorb you may

01:40:04.865 --> 01:40:06.300
not see anything on so for that

01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:08.435
that point and then you have

01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:12.272
about seventy million coming

01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:12.840
eighty seven ninety million

01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:14.141
coming from the formation

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:14.708
seventy million still being

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:16.677
injected I don't in sixty going

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:18.379
through there. And at three

01:40:18.445 --> 01:40:20.447
fifteen this melted they shut

01:40:20.514 --> 01:40:22.416
it off and at that point of

01:40:22.483 --> 01:40:24.485
course the seventy million went

01:40:24.551 --> 01:40:28.422
away but the ninety from that

01:40:28.489 --> 01:40:29.022
as work continued to be going

01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:29.523
on. At that point it was

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:32.426
smiling. So the key takeaway

01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:34.395
for us was all failures happen

01:40:34.461 --> 01:40:36.263
one day on October twenty

01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:38.298
third. VA before any kilograms

01:40:38.365 --> 01:40:38.766
was started the first

01:40:38.832 --> 01:40:39.333
collectibles October twenty

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.269
fourth. So that gives a very

01:40:42.336 --> 01:40:44.405
good feel what happened up to

01:40:44.471 --> 01:40:45.038
the point of incest with books.

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:48.375
What do you do. I'm sorry. Post

01:40:48.442 --> 01:40:50.310
leak around so I'm not going to

01:40:50.377 --> 01:40:50.944
jump into what happened after

01:40:51.011 --> 01:40:52.579
the leak was discovered YA

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:54.281
where we interested our job was

01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:56.283
rude because- I've already

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:56.817
figured out. Of because I

01:40:56.884 --> 01:40:58.585
didn't know all of this until.

01:40:58.652 --> 01:41:00.254
Eight months ago but- if I

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:04.291
figured why do I need to know

01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:04.858
apple students posted in so

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:06.193
many important because-

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:08.462
initially they reported on

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:09.029
daily reports the leak was

01:41:09.096 --> 01:41:10.564
small then. And today it was a

01:41:10.631 --> 01:41:11.198
blow out to sort of a different

01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:12.633
accounts we had to go by all

01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:14.601
the records. Doggett had daily

01:41:14.668 --> 01:41:16.537
reports Ocala daily reports

01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:18.739
some service companies a daily

01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:20.507
reports we looked at it. We

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:22.376
have to understand how how gas

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:26.413
Lou how much gas blue. Did they

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.047
can let them to make it any any

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:30.350
worse. So we did some floor

01:41:30.417 --> 01:41:30.951
eight and I would like to call

01:41:31.018 --> 01:41:32.286
Kim Marling I'm going to I'm

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:34.254
giving you a conclusion. What

01:41:34.321 --> 01:41:36.490
we did was we looked at twenty

01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:38.592
years of flow test data from so

01:41:38.659 --> 01:41:40.627
cal gas. Using that we build

01:41:40.694 --> 01:41:42.296
would be called a well inflow

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:44.598
and outflow. So at any point.

01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:46.567
With the with some pressure

01:41:46.633 --> 01:41:48.168
date I can't we can tell you

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:48.669
pretty acted reasonably

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:50.571
accurately. How much gas was

01:41:50.637 --> 01:41:52.172
coming out of the well. So we

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:54.241
estimated what I'm showing you

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:54.808
there if you just follow the

01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:58.612
green dots there. Basil all the

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:00.647
morning we did all the analysis

01:42:00.714 --> 01:42:02.282
we did we are giving we

01:42:02.349 --> 01:42:02.916
establish a floated every day.

01:42:02.983 --> 01:42:04.651
Every day and it was a match to

01:42:04.718 --> 01:42:05.219
it pressure data from an

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:06.587
observation while. So I know

01:42:06.653 --> 01:42:07.221
one day one it was ninety three

01:42:07.287 --> 01:42:10.557
million. And those red lines

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:12.693
are the days when they can let

01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:14.294
them start happening so every

01:42:14.361 --> 01:42:14.828
kill attempt either. Via a

01:42:14.895 --> 01:42:16.697
pretty good idea what the what

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:18.432
was blood flowing out. No we

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:20.701
did a detail modeling here we

01:42:20.767 --> 01:42:22.569
also have in the report some

01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:24.438
back of the envelope. Quick

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:26.406
calculations you can do to get

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:27.040
approximate numbers. Bays on

01:42:27.107 --> 01:42:28.575
pressured information. So

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:30.511
there's two different ways you

01:42:30.577 --> 01:42:32.779
have to know floated. Before

01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:36.383
you figure out how to kill a.

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:38.585
Sold as we probe we model this

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:39.152
is a commercially available

01:42:39.219 --> 01:42:40.354
software anybody can buy the

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.456
software. This two three

01:42:42.523 --> 01:42:44.291
different companies that sell

01:42:44.358 --> 01:42:44.958
the software. We use a software

01:42:45.025 --> 01:42:48.595
call drill bench remodel the

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:50.497
collective sui said what would

01:42:50.564 --> 01:42:52.399
it take to kill the well. And

01:42:52.466 --> 01:42:54.301
we also look at how we do us

01:42:54.368 --> 01:42:54.968
the well was killed and we also

01:42:55.035 --> 01:42:56.770
took into assumption of course

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:58.705
because we were doing the root

01:42:58.772 --> 01:43:00.474
cause I knew exactly what dept

01:43:00.541 --> 01:43:02.376
the weather was killed that so

01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:02.976
we said we said okay I don't

01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:04.645
know let's say a V. somebody is

01:43:04.711 --> 01:43:06.813
in four hundred feet. Could you

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.315
have done this somebody's in

01:43:08.382 --> 01:43:08.982
thousand feet so we did all the

01:43:09.049 --> 01:43:14.621
scenarios. Our conclusion was

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:15.122
the well could have been

01:43:15.188 --> 01:43:18.292
successfully killed. This is

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:18.859
we'd show we discussed with

01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:20.661
with the expert with other

01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:22.296
experts who have level control

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:22.863
experts the modeling data

01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:24.565
confirmed it other other

01:43:24.631 --> 01:43:26.667
similar experts confirmed it

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:28.402
with the modeling data that

01:43:28.468 --> 01:43:28.969
does well could have been

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:32.406
killed prior to the leaf fell

01:43:32.472 --> 01:43:34.308
into section of the wellbore

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:36.543
perhaps first two or three

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:37.177
kills your figure for getting

01:43:37.244 --> 01:43:40.614
out what is. Happening by it

01:43:40.681 --> 01:43:41.214
but the thing by the total for

01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:44.618
two out for. Kilograms this

01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:46.753
well should have been killed.

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:48.455
And what you see here is table

01:43:48.522 --> 01:43:49.022
twenty one from the report.

01:43:49.089 --> 01:43:50.557
This is sad Ken number three.

01:43:50.624 --> 01:43:52.326
What what should have what

01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:54.328
perhaps should have been tried.

01:43:54.394 --> 01:43:56.496
Is a heavier mud twelve to

01:43:56.563 --> 01:43:58.332
fifteen pounds per gallon.

01:43:58.398 --> 01:43:58.899
Pumped at about six to eight

01:43:58.966 --> 01:44:02.402
barrels per minute. Now the

01:44:02.469 --> 01:44:04.338
proof for this is art by the

01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:04.938
time they went to can number

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:08.342
seven. They had modeled it.

01:44:08.408 --> 01:44:08.875
Killed two through six no

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:12.346
morning was done prior to kill

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:12.980
seven which was December twenty

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:14.581
second. Day model it and they

01:44:14.648 --> 01:44:16.883
went in with fifteen pound per

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:18.385
gallon be nearly controlled the

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:20.554
route and there by a fifteen

01:44:20.621 --> 01:44:22.589
that I forget the date there

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:23.156
eighteen. December it was

01:44:23.223 --> 01:44:30.364
about. Fifteen fifty one of.

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.931
Fifty five million today was

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:32.666
much lower than that ninety

01:44:32.733 --> 01:44:34.735
three. But by that time and

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:35.335
they got it under control the

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:36.803
location was in very bad shape

01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:37.404
they were craters there. So

01:44:37.471 --> 01:44:38.905
they had to abandon that was

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:39.473
really it was too risky to

01:44:39.539 --> 01:44:42.442
continue coming up. But this

01:44:42.509 --> 01:44:44.511
that the art analysis shows

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:48.515
that at a higher density an

01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:49.149
appropriate money it could have

01:44:49.216 --> 01:44:52.619
been killed. Okay so the last

01:44:52.686 --> 01:44:54.454
part of my discussion here.

01:44:54.521 --> 01:44:55.055
Lisa can encasing in that what

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:56.657
we were after here was to

01:44:56.723 --> 01:44:58.759
understand. Our our edict was

01:44:58.825 --> 01:45:00.627
will cause analysis so we

01:45:00.694 --> 01:45:01.161
wanted to look at all the

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:02.429
routes however they managed.

01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:04.498
Was some of the problems seen

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:06.600
another wells. Where the

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:08.802
exactly the same that was an

01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:10.470
intent when we took this on.

01:45:10.537 --> 01:45:14.675
And of course this is in the

01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:16.576
report there is a history of

01:45:16.643 --> 01:45:18.445
casing leaks in in a diesel.

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:19.079
And there is no relationship

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:20.947
with age this is not a function

01:45:21.014 --> 01:45:22.883
of age of the well there are

01:45:22.949 --> 01:45:24.851
some newer residential leak

01:45:24.918 --> 01:45:26.453
some or all of us to the show

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:27.054
so there are different reasons

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:28.789
normally there are different

01:45:28.855 --> 01:45:30.824
reasons every one of them for

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:32.659
me to get it immediately needed

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:33.193
me they would either put a

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:34.795
Siemens and they're they're

01:45:34.861 --> 01:45:35.429
putting their kissing in their

01:45:35.495 --> 01:45:38.532
scalp Linus liners in there it

01:45:38.598 --> 01:45:39.032
was effectively managed

01:45:39.099 --> 01:45:40.667
immediately it was the it was

01:45:40.734 --> 01:45:42.569
always controlled. How aware

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:44.538
what we observed was we

01:45:44.604 --> 01:45:46.740
couldn't go back and figure why

01:45:46.807 --> 01:45:47.340
these happen that's would be

01:45:47.407 --> 01:45:48.742
right after our job was one our

01:45:48.809 --> 01:45:50.477
job was to ask why everything

01:45:50.544 --> 01:45:52.612
we asked why he said why did

01:45:52.679 --> 01:45:53.246
you why why did these corrosion

01:45:53.313 --> 01:45:58.885
happen was. It in the cellar.

01:45:58.952 --> 01:46:02.522
We follow no evidence of that.

01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:03.156
Then the second point I want to

01:46:03.223 --> 01:46:04.891
make. Is in nineteen eighty

01:46:04.958 --> 01:46:05.525
eight there was a memo it was a

01:46:05.592 --> 01:46:06.660
very proactive. Action taken in

01:46:06.727 --> 01:46:07.227
nineteen eighty eight. There

01:46:07.294 --> 01:46:08.695
was that reported an internal

01:46:08.762 --> 01:46:10.497
memo said we need to inspect

01:46:10.564 --> 01:46:11.098
twenty routes all these twenty

01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:11.631
rows. Different people had

01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:14.501
approved it. Seven out of the

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:15.135
twenty what inspected this was

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:16.737
very pioneering in nineteen

01:46:16.803 --> 01:46:17.237
eighty eight four Donald

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:18.805
condition soul pipelines a

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:20.774
different story but don't hold

01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:22.642
it was quite pioneering not too

01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:23.243
many people inspecting those

01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:26.680
days. And five of the seven had

01:46:26.747 --> 01:46:28.682
external corrosion. But then we

01:46:28.749 --> 01:46:30.751
lost track of data there was no

01:46:30.817 --> 01:46:31.284
data to tell as white was

01:46:31.351 --> 01:46:32.886
suddenly stopped. All five of

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:34.855
them had external corrosion

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:36.790
source it was not the same as a

01:46:36.857 --> 01:46:38.525
lethal. But there was external

01:46:38.592 --> 01:46:39.126
corrosion external cut like

01:46:39.192 --> 01:46:40.761
some corrosion I mean on the

01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:42.829
outside of the seven inch.

01:46:42.896 --> 01:46:44.498
Inside of a seven inch the gas

01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:48.535
is dry this what we call.

01:46:48.602 --> 01:46:49.102
Pipeline quality gas. Should

01:46:49.169 --> 01:46:52.672
not corrode at all. Now the

01:46:52.739 --> 01:46:53.273
next bit of data we looked at

01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:54.841
was there was a general rate

01:46:54.908 --> 01:46:56.877
case submission in twenty

01:46:56.943 --> 01:47:00.580
sixteen that testimony was. So

01:47:00.647 --> 01:47:02.616
cal gas had identified risk

01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:04.584
assessment was necessary the

01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:05.152
required a storage integrity

01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:08.522
management plan which has since

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:10.590
been implemented. Our dad was

01:47:10.657 --> 01:47:12.826
recognized by so cal gas it was

01:47:12.893 --> 01:47:14.728
also recognized as part of the

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:16.696
submission. That their their

01:47:16.763 --> 01:47:17.297
integrity of the I was being

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:18.899
reactive up to that not being

01:47:18.965 --> 01:47:20.801
proactive because recognized by

01:47:20.867 --> 01:47:22.869
so cal gas. It was so cal gas

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:24.838
is interpretation of that

01:47:24.905 --> 01:47:26.873
point. So those recognition

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.508
that pre twenty fifteen any

01:47:28.575 --> 01:47:30.510
leak immediately fix it but-

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:32.679
not not figure why wont how

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:34.981
extensive. The whole risk

01:47:35.048 --> 01:47:38.819
assessment process. So we had

01:47:38.885 --> 01:47:39.419
all our data now we had we

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:40.053
understood what happened on the

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:40.854
failure we understood what

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:44.591
happened. After the failure we

01:47:44.658 --> 01:47:45.225
understood historically how the

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:48.528
field was managed. So we took

01:47:48.595 --> 01:47:49.162
on a systematic add root cause

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:52.699
analysis process. It's a very

01:47:52.766 --> 01:47:54.801
deliberate process. A few of

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:56.636
the key members in town of the

01:47:56.703 --> 01:47:58.705
blade sat around. And said why

01:47:58.772 --> 01:48:00.874
did it happen in. An evidence

01:48:00.941 --> 01:48:02.809
based we couldn't make any root

01:48:02.876 --> 01:48:04.644
cause conclusion unless I can

01:48:04.711 --> 01:48:05.178
provide evidence for that

01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:06.780
particular statement we start.

01:48:06.847 --> 01:48:08.682
With the uncontrolled outflow

01:48:08.748 --> 01:48:10.784
four hundred and fifteen days

01:48:10.851 --> 01:48:14.654
was our primary effect and then

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:15.255
why did it happen and then we

01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:16.823
kept going until we reached.

01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:18.892
Root causes so they would put

01:48:18.959 --> 01:48:20.994
it causes of already talked

01:48:21.061 --> 01:48:21.595
about it number one was the

01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:23.063
axial rupture due to external

01:48:23.129 --> 01:48:25.131
microbial corrosion. And second

01:48:25.198 --> 01:48:26.967
was unsuccessful topic of.

01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:30.670
Which within sufficient density

01:48:30.737 --> 01:48:31.171
and pump rates. Now we

01:48:31.238 --> 01:48:34.674
identified many root causes and

01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:35.275
I'm gonna present them in the

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:36.810
next flight as part of our-

01:48:36.877 --> 01:48:38.979
root cause solutions because

01:48:39.045 --> 01:48:40.881
when we do a root cause

01:48:40.947 --> 01:48:42.816
analysis we identify. Solutions

01:48:42.883 --> 01:48:49.089
to the. Root cause and then the

01:48:49.155 --> 01:48:52.692
back from there the root causes.

01:48:52.759 --> 01:48:53.293
So the solutions are the root

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.061
cause of that red identified

01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:55.562
that have already been

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:56.196
implemented I've listed them by

01:48:56.263 --> 01:48:56.663
things that have been

01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:58.665
implemented. And things that

01:48:58.732 --> 01:48:59.165
are perhaps a I'm sure

01:48:59.232 --> 01:49:01.034
somebody's when implement that

01:49:01.101 --> 01:49:03.003
there there. There there's some

01:49:03.069 --> 01:49:03.603
some root causes that have not

01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:06.773
been implemented. It is based

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:07.407
well integrity plan was it was

01:49:07.474 --> 01:49:08.875
essential to manage a facility

01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:11.011
to make sure incidents such as

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:13.046
SS twenty five and other

01:49:13.113 --> 01:49:13.580
similar instance can be

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:15.048
prevented. Risk assessment is

01:49:15.115 --> 01:49:18.685
quarter that I'm gonna go to go

01:49:18.752 --> 01:49:20.687
to a tiki once on that list

01:49:20.754 --> 01:49:21.288
that I believe it is essential

01:49:21.354 --> 01:49:23.089
second one is to bring Parker

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:24.691
completion and will Beria.

01:49:24.758 --> 01:49:26.793
Today by law in California it's

01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:28.895
unique to California it is not

01:49:28.962 --> 01:49:30.764
true in any other place the

01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:31.331
required will better system

01:49:31.398 --> 01:49:33.099
what to do about your system

01:49:33.166 --> 01:49:34.868
and allow you to do is you're

01:49:34.935 --> 01:49:36.803
only producing to the tubing.

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:39.072
The seven inch casing would

01:49:39.139 --> 01:49:39.706
never have been exposed to gas

01:49:39.773 --> 01:49:41.074
into the being filled with kill

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:44.811
my door or Packer floored so an

01:49:44.878 --> 01:49:48.782
incident like this is I don't

01:49:48.848 --> 01:49:50.684
wanna say impossible highly

01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:52.852
highly improbable that that is

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:56.823
intended that. Casing wanting

01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:58.892
this inspection so they've

01:49:58.959 --> 01:50:00.961
already done all the kissing

01:50:01.027 --> 01:50:06.900
wilderness. And the real time

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:08.902
quotes of and that's an

01:50:08.969 --> 01:50:12.706
important one so if you see

01:50:12.772 --> 01:50:16.710
reinterpreted what happened

01:50:16.776 --> 01:50:19.079
sequence based on compressor

01:50:19.145 --> 01:50:22.949
data house in feet away from

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:29.022
the rubble sick. White happened

01:50:29.089 --> 01:50:30.957
you can prevented another since

01:50:31.024 --> 01:50:33.193
incidents and any new wells are

01:50:33.259 --> 01:50:34.995
the second one is when you

01:50:35.061 --> 01:50:36.863
drill new wells you want a

01:50:36.930 --> 01:50:38.798
seaman surface causing to pop

01:50:38.865 --> 01:50:39.332
you can prevent that the

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:40.867
corrosion production casing to

01:50:40.934 --> 01:50:42.769
the top. And in some cases the

01:50:42.836 --> 01:50:43.370
formation of such you cannot

01:50:43.436 --> 01:50:45.271
semen to surface casing you can

01:50:45.338 --> 01:50:49.075
have a C. P. system and prevent

01:50:49.142 --> 01:50:52.712
this any form of corrosion. So

01:50:52.779 --> 01:50:53.279
I ran through a depreciated

01:50:53.346 --> 01:50:54.914
time. Thank you. Thank you I

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:55.448
will be following up with

01:50:55.515 --> 01:50:56.816
questions thank you doctor. And

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:57.384
one final thing this is the

01:50:57.450 --> 01:51:01.254
report. In the main report is

01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:02.789
released on may sixteenth at

01:51:02.856 --> 01:51:04.891
their supplemental reports if

01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:05.425
you're interested in can

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:06.893
attempt if an interesting

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:07.394
failure analysis this

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.062
excruciating detail thank you.

01:51:09.129 --> 01:51:12.899
Very good thank you thank you

01:51:12.966 --> 01:51:14.901
for the excruciating detail. We

01:51:14.968 --> 01:51:18.838
needed it and we still do. I'll

01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:21.074
I'll I deputy director Marshall

01:51:21.141 --> 01:51:23.176
your testimony and then we'll

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:23.777
follow up with a few questions

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:27.113
okay thank you Sir. Thank you

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:29.282
senator the use of the woman. A

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:32.952
great deck is up. I'm. Well a

01:51:33.019 --> 01:51:35.188
preface thank you for holding

01:51:35.255 --> 01:51:36.956
the hearing giving us the

01:51:37.023 --> 01:51:37.557
opportunity to indicate what

01:51:37.624 --> 01:51:39.092
the department has been doing

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:41.061
in response not only to the

01:51:41.127 --> 01:51:43.163
Lisa canyon failure welfare to

01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:45.298
assist twenty five but also

01:51:45.365 --> 01:51:48.935
with regard to the blade root

01:51:49.002 --> 01:51:50.837
cause analysis report I think

01:51:50.904 --> 01:51:51.371
you see as I as I make

01:51:51.438 --> 01:51:53.073
presentation some of this

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:54.908
material is familiar to

01:51:54.974 --> 01:51:56.943
residents here in Porter ranch

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:57.510
to maybe some of the other

01:51:57.577 --> 01:52:01.114
members in the audience. It is

01:52:01.181 --> 01:52:02.916
by presenting again though in

01:52:02.982 --> 01:52:05.118
the context of the root cause

01:52:05.185 --> 01:52:06.853
analysis that I think you'll

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:07.420
you'll see why I want to. Go

01:52:07.487 --> 01:52:10.890
over some of those things again.

01:52:10.957 --> 01:52:11.524
So we're going to talk a little

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:12.092
bit about. The conference a

01:52:12.158 --> 01:52:12.926
safety review that was

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:13.593
required. When I talk about new

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:16.863
operating requirements

01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:17.464
regulations and then plans for

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:21.101
subsequent regulations. So when

01:52:21.167 --> 01:52:24.971
the I SS twenty five well

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:25.538
experience the blood then in

01:52:25.605 --> 01:52:28.842
October two thousand fifteen.

01:52:28.908 --> 01:52:29.476
We started looking at the real

01:52:29.542 --> 01:52:32.912
question of just ourselves how

01:52:32.979 --> 01:52:33.546
did you end up with gas coming

01:52:33.613 --> 01:52:36.850
out of the ground. It was very

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:37.484
obvious to us that there must

01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:39.085
be some failure of casing we

01:52:39.152 --> 01:52:39.619
didn't have a root cause

01:52:39.686 --> 01:52:42.856
analysis to tell us that. But

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:43.456
it was very obvious that there

01:52:43.523 --> 01:52:45.191
must be some kind of failure of

01:52:45.258 --> 01:52:49.095
casing. And so. We started even

01:52:49.162 --> 01:52:51.164
as the well was was still being

01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:52.866
attempted to control an A. as

01:52:52.932 --> 01:52:55.135
secondary. Well is being

01:52:55.201 --> 01:52:57.003
drilled for intercept. We had

01:52:57.070 --> 01:52:59.005
ordered the operator to stop

01:52:59.072 --> 01:52:59.572
injecting gas and they were

01:52:59.639 --> 01:53:01.107
trying to withdraw gas to

01:53:01.174 --> 01:53:01.608
reduce pressure in the

01:53:01.674 --> 01:53:04.878
formation during that time. But

01:53:04.944 --> 01:53:05.478
we were coming up with even as

01:53:05.545 --> 01:53:07.046
as that was all happening. A

01:53:07.113 --> 01:53:09.349
means of testing the other

01:53:09.415 --> 01:53:11.184
wells in the facility we knew

01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:11.784
that there were a hundred and

01:53:11.851 --> 01:53:13.052
thirteen other wells there the

01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:15.321
that SS twenty five and many of

01:53:15.388 --> 01:53:16.856
them shared the same.

01:53:16.923 --> 01:53:17.457
Construction vintage built in

01:53:17.524 --> 01:53:19.225
the fifties is oil and gas

01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:19.826
wells converted in the early

01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:21.294
seventies to. Gas storage

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:23.296
wells. And so we knew that we

01:53:23.363 --> 01:53:25.231
needed to have a couple of

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:27.033
different testing regimes. The

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:29.235
testing regimes that had been

01:53:29.302 --> 01:53:29.836
in current regulation at the

01:53:29.903 --> 01:53:31.437
time were really what we would

01:53:31.504 --> 01:53:33.306
call it a determinative kind of

01:53:33.373 --> 01:53:35.308
test that is to say is there a

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:37.043
leaking now and that's the kind

01:53:37.110 --> 01:53:37.677
of test that you're looking at.

01:53:37.744 --> 01:53:39.212
That's actually like a noise

01:53:39.279 --> 01:53:41.147
longer temperature log where

01:53:41.214 --> 01:53:41.781
you're trying to listen for the

01:53:41.848 --> 01:53:43.316
sound of rushing gas coming

01:53:43.383 --> 01:53:45.151
outside of a well. Or the

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:47.086
temperature log weird gases

01:53:47.153 --> 01:53:48.888
decompressing in this cooling

01:53:48.955 --> 01:53:51.291
and giving indication again

01:53:51.357 --> 01:53:51.791
that something is that

01:53:51.858 --> 01:53:52.392
something is amiss with the

01:53:52.458 --> 01:53:55.128
casing. We knew that we needed

01:53:55.195 --> 01:53:55.695
to do that for all of the

01:53:55.762 --> 01:53:59.065
wells. SS twenty five was at

01:53:59.132 --> 01:54:01.134
the time was scheduled for

01:54:01.201 --> 01:54:01.734
annual testing of noise into

01:54:01.801 --> 01:54:05.004
blogs. It had passed that test

01:54:05.071 --> 01:54:07.340
a little less than one year

01:54:07.407 --> 01:54:11.010
prior and was due for testing.

01:54:11.077 --> 01:54:17.083
If not days and weeks after.

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:21.087
The leak was found. So. We knew

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:21.688
we had to do that we do that

01:54:21.754 --> 01:54:22.288
for all of the other wells in

01:54:22.355 --> 01:54:22.922
the field. And we also wanted

01:54:22.989 --> 01:54:23.556
to make sure that we did this

01:54:23.623 --> 01:54:24.057
what we call battery to

01:54:24.123 --> 01:54:24.624
testing. And this is really

01:54:24.691 --> 01:54:25.225
where we start getting into

01:54:25.291 --> 01:54:26.993
what I call predictive testing

01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:27.660
where you're now looking at. Is

01:54:27.727 --> 01:54:29.262
the cement competent using

01:54:29.329 --> 01:54:31.231
tools to measure the thickness

01:54:31.297 --> 01:54:33.499
and the bonding of the cement

01:54:33.566 --> 01:54:35.134
between the casing and the

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:35.768
surrounding ground. The well is

01:54:35.835 --> 01:54:39.005
constructed into talking about

01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:39.639
a caliper log which is really

01:54:39.706 --> 01:54:41.274
testing to see if the- the-

01:54:41.341 --> 01:54:45.011
casing is still cylindrical. Or

01:54:45.078 --> 01:54:45.678
whether it's deformed a little

01:54:45.745 --> 01:54:47.213
bit flattened out. Ultrasonic

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.182
casing inspection log magnetic

01:54:49.249 --> 01:54:51.050
flux casing inspection logs I

01:54:51.117 --> 01:54:51.551
could have a Walker or

01:54:51.618 --> 01:54:53.186
technical expert come on up and

01:54:53.253 --> 01:54:53.753
explain that but- they're

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:55.355
basically tests to determine

01:54:55.421 --> 01:54:57.290
whether or not there's

01:54:57.357 --> 01:54:59.092
corrosion. Going on in the

01:54:59.158 --> 01:55:01.094
casing. And lastly we wanted to

01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:01.661
make sure we had pressure

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:03.029
testing done. Of the production

01:55:03.096 --> 01:55:05.031
casing the two bins and Packers

01:55:05.098 --> 01:55:05.598
of all of those hundred and

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:07.166
thirteen wells. Because again.

01:55:07.233 --> 01:55:09.102
We knew. Well we're in the

01:55:09.168 --> 01:55:09.702
middle of the emergency. That

01:55:09.769 --> 01:55:11.471
at some point in time. That

01:55:11.537 --> 01:55:13.339
emergency would stop. And we

01:55:13.406 --> 01:55:15.341
would need to make sure that

01:55:15.408 --> 01:55:17.110
the rest of the facility. What

01:55:17.176 --> 01:55:21.014
was not going to be.

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:21.581
Experiencing that kind of a

01:55:21.648 --> 01:55:29.188
catastrophic failure. There we

01:55:29.255 --> 01:55:35.194
go. So we are started doing the

01:55:35.261 --> 01:55:37.263
comprehensive safety review for

01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:37.930
all of the other wells this is

01:55:37.997 --> 01:55:39.332
after we got the well was

01:55:39.399 --> 01:55:41.367
controlled in February started

01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:43.303
doing that conference a safety

01:55:43.369 --> 01:55:45.171
review and it is it is ongoing

01:55:45.238 --> 01:55:47.473
I am aware that there is a time

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:48.141
frame that we need to get that

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:49.575
done there's one well that is

01:55:49.642 --> 01:55:51.411
still out there that is. Quite

01:55:51.477 --> 01:55:53.479
complex with a lot of

01:55:53.546 --> 01:55:55.481
obstructions in the well bore

01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:57.417
it has taken months for them to

01:55:57.483 --> 01:55:59.385
get through we are erring on

01:55:59.452 --> 01:56:01.287
the side of safety rather than

01:56:01.354 --> 01:56:03.356
than time to make sure that

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:05.091
gets done it is isolated as

01:56:05.158 --> 01:56:07.126
you'll see from the discussion

01:56:07.193 --> 01:56:07.760
so of the hundred and fourteen

01:56:07.827 --> 01:56:11.130
wells including SS twenty five.

01:56:11.197 --> 01:56:11.798
Sixty six wells have passed all

01:56:11.864 --> 01:56:13.433
the tests and approved for

01:56:13.499 --> 01:56:15.168
service that means they've

01:56:15.234 --> 01:56:15.802
passed both of those batteries

01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:17.570
of tests they may have they may

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:21.641
have been found initially to a

01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:22.141
failed but they've been

01:56:22.208 --> 01:56:23.276
repaired and then tested again

01:56:23.343 --> 01:56:25.378
and passed. Forty three wells

01:56:25.445 --> 01:56:27.213
have been taken out of service

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:27.880
by taking out of service I mean

01:56:27.947 --> 01:56:29.148
they've been plugged with

01:56:29.215 --> 01:56:31.284
cement service restoration is

01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:33.286
not yet complete but they've

01:56:33.353 --> 01:56:33.786
been published a mentor

01:56:33.853 --> 01:56:37.056
isolated from that formation

01:56:37.123 --> 01:56:37.690
one well. The one that you're

01:56:37.757 --> 01:56:39.525
referring to is isolated from

01:56:39.592 --> 01:56:41.561
the plug from the formation and

01:56:41.627 --> 01:56:42.128
the playing operations are

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:45.298
nearly complete. And for wells

01:56:45.365 --> 01:56:45.865
have been plugged with full

01:56:45.932 --> 01:56:47.300
service restoration. And so

01:56:47.367 --> 01:56:49.335
when those when those. When

01:56:49.402 --> 01:56:51.170
those reviews were completed

01:56:51.237 --> 01:56:53.172
and we had the wells at

01:56:53.239 --> 01:56:53.740
isolated from the formation

01:56:53.806 --> 01:56:55.241
that was when the division. Was

01:56:55.308 --> 01:56:57.610
able to make the determination

01:56:57.677 --> 01:56:59.545
that that the field to go back

01:56:59.612 --> 01:57:00.113
on injection and production

01:57:00.179 --> 01:57:03.316
albeit. In limited amounts and

01:57:03.383 --> 01:57:05.618
those limited amounts were set

01:57:05.685 --> 01:57:07.253
both by dog and by the PC. So

01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:09.188
there are ongoing operational

01:57:09.255 --> 01:57:09.822
requirements that have been in

01:57:09.889 --> 01:57:11.524
effect one of them is the

01:57:11.591 --> 01:57:12.158
maximum range of what pressures

01:57:12.225 --> 01:57:13.726
being held down to twenty nine

01:57:13.793 --> 01:57:15.628
hundred. Twenty six PSI which

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:17.363
is quite a bit lower than what

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:19.432
so cal gas would like. We have

01:57:19.499 --> 01:57:21.534
continuous pressure monitoring

01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:23.603
required on the two beings and

01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:24.237
on the annular space of all the

01:57:24.303 --> 01:57:27.173
storage wells. Fence line air

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.175
monitoring exists for methane

01:57:29.242 --> 01:57:29.709
and there are daily Fleer

01:57:29.776 --> 01:57:31.310
camera images for gas

01:57:31.377 --> 01:57:33.479
inspection for leaks at all the

01:57:33.546 --> 01:57:34.080
well sites and again the Fleer

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:35.415
cameras looking for a

01:57:35.481 --> 01:57:39.485
decompression. Is looking for

01:57:39.552 --> 01:57:39.919
gas in the form of a

01:57:39.986 --> 01:57:41.254
temperature change. We

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:43.589
establish new regulations as we

01:57:43.656 --> 01:57:45.491
went through this process one

01:57:45.558 --> 01:57:47.427
of the things that we did

01:57:47.493 --> 01:57:49.262
initially was to immediately it

01:57:49.328 --> 01:57:51.431
acts of emergency regulations.

01:57:51.497 --> 01:57:52.098
As you know senator of this and

01:57:52.165 --> 01:57:53.566
the woman. At mercy regulations

01:57:53.633 --> 01:57:55.435
have a lifespan of one year

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:57.470
those emergency regulations at.

01:57:57.537 --> 01:57:59.539
Required all of those tests

01:57:59.605 --> 01:58:01.340
that I mentioned as well as

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:03.209
other operational requirements.

01:58:03.276 --> 01:58:05.344
I think the legislature for the

01:58:05.411 --> 01:58:05.945
authorization to extend those

01:58:06.012 --> 01:58:07.547
emergency regulations Biondi

01:58:07.613 --> 01:58:09.315
here because to make the-

01:58:09.382 --> 01:58:11.217
permanent regulations effective

01:58:11.284 --> 01:58:11.851
we really needed to make sure

01:58:11.918 --> 01:58:13.553
we had time. And we didn't want

01:58:13.619 --> 01:58:17.657
to see a gap. In protection and

01:58:17.723 --> 01:58:18.257
so that was very important for

01:58:18.324 --> 01:58:19.492
us to get that dealing with the

01:58:19.559 --> 01:58:21.494
new regulations I'll go through

01:58:21.561 --> 01:58:22.094
some of the high points of

01:58:22.161 --> 01:58:25.198
them. One of them is insuring

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:27.700
as- as the blade representative

01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:29.469
I indicated is that we don't

01:58:29.535 --> 01:58:31.204
have single points of failure.

01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:33.439
When the well was producing

01:58:33.506 --> 01:58:34.040
before through both to being

01:58:34.106 --> 01:58:35.842
and casing. Pressure was being

01:58:35.908 --> 01:58:37.810
exerted on both the tubing and

01:58:37.877 --> 01:58:39.479
the external casing. Which

01:58:39.545 --> 01:58:41.314
means that if the casing fails

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:43.382
there is no back up. So that

01:58:43.449 --> 01:58:45.384
was a single point of failure.

01:58:45.451 --> 01:58:47.220
Under the current regulations.

01:58:47.286 --> 01:58:47.854
The only place that pressure

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:49.589
can be exerted is inside the

01:58:49.655 --> 01:58:51.290
tubing whether it's on

01:58:51.357 --> 01:58:51.924
injection or a withdrawal the

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:53.759
pressure can only be on the two

01:58:53.826 --> 01:58:55.561
big. If the tubing was to fail.

01:58:55.628 --> 01:58:57.663
Then the casing is there and

01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:59.465
it's not under pressure and I

01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:00.166
can act as a as a safety net or

01:59:00.233 --> 01:59:01.601
catchment. So that then the

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:03.636
repair work can be done and you

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:07.473
don't end up with. A failure

01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:08.040
into the subsurface into the

01:59:08.107 --> 01:59:11.444
surrounding earth. We required

01:59:11.511 --> 01:59:12.011
risk management planning I

01:59:12.078 --> 01:59:13.713
won't go through each one of

01:59:13.779 --> 01:59:14.347
these items but I'll just give

01:59:14.413 --> 01:59:15.381
you the high points of them

01:59:15.448 --> 01:59:15.915
risk management plan is

01:59:15.982 --> 01:59:19.318
required for all guest workers

01:59:19.385 --> 01:59:19.952
to lose in the state now we're

01:59:20.019 --> 01:59:21.754
talking about identification of

01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:25.224
potential threats and hazards

01:59:25.291 --> 01:59:25.825
including corrosion and that

01:59:25.892 --> 01:59:26.392
would include some of the

01:59:26.459 --> 01:59:27.493
testing that's going to be one

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:28.094
of these are the bullets here

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.695
regular mechanical integrity

01:59:29.762 --> 01:59:33.432
testing that regime of phase

01:59:33.499 --> 01:59:35.601
one and phase two testing

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:37.570
that's required on a regular

01:59:37.637 --> 01:59:39.772
basis now different periods for

01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:41.607
different types of testing but

01:59:41.674 --> 01:59:43.342
it's required and regular basis

01:59:43.409 --> 01:59:43.910
to repeated to ensure that

01:59:43.976 --> 01:59:45.645
there aren't corrosion issues

01:59:45.711 --> 01:59:47.613
arising that. They are being

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:49.682
observed quantitative risk

01:59:49.749 --> 01:59:51.517
assessments are required well

01:59:51.584 --> 01:59:53.653
by well risk assessments casing

01:59:53.719 --> 01:59:57.423
corrosion monitoring. And

01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:57.990
emergency response planning

01:59:58.057 --> 02:00:01.394
among those details. In

02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:01.961
addition we have monitoring

02:00:02.028 --> 02:00:03.729
requirements for all wells in

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:05.565
casters disabilities.

02:00:05.631 --> 02:00:07.533
Monitoring of the storage was

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.335
were material balance and

02:00:09.402 --> 02:00:09.969
reservoir integrity so you're

02:00:10.036 --> 02:00:11.604
talking about how much gas is

02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:12.271
being injected how much gas is

02:00:12.338 --> 02:00:13.706
being withdrawn. Immediate

02:00:13.773 --> 02:00:15.508
reporting of intended

02:00:15.575 --> 02:00:17.343
unintended gas releases

02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:19.345
chemical fingerprinting. Alarms

02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:19.946
for annulus pressure changes

02:00:20.012 --> 02:00:21.514
that's an important one again

02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:23.349
as indicated by the blood

02:00:23.416 --> 02:00:25.518
report if you seeing a change

02:00:25.585 --> 02:00:27.420
in that any other pressure it

02:00:27.486 --> 02:00:27.954
means that something has

02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:29.388
happened inside that tubing.

02:00:29.455 --> 02:00:29.889
Likely means something's

02:00:29.956 --> 02:00:33.426
happened inside the tubing. And

02:00:33.492 --> 02:00:33.993
you've got a compromise you

02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:35.561
need to take take a look at

02:00:35.628 --> 02:00:36.128
that. And then testing the

02:00:36.195 --> 02:00:37.797
safety valves every six months

02:00:37.863 --> 02:00:39.599
real time data gathering is

02:00:39.665 --> 02:00:43.803
also. Critical to successfully

02:00:43.869 --> 02:00:45.404
regulating in these facilities.

02:00:45.471 --> 02:00:45.972
One of the things is as you

02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:47.840
know no one of things that was

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:48.474
required by both the P. you see

02:00:48.541 --> 02:00:51.611
in dog was the independent.

02:00:51.677 --> 02:00:53.546
Root cause analysis conducted

02:00:53.613 --> 02:00:55.581
by blade that focuses on

02:00:55.648 --> 02:00:56.115
technical issues and the

02:00:56.182 --> 02:00:57.750
technical because of the leak.

02:00:57.817 --> 02:00:59.785
There is a secondary root cause

02:00:59.852 --> 02:01:03.389
analysis being conducted by Dr.

02:01:03.456 --> 02:01:04.056
And that is focused entirely on

02:01:04.123 --> 02:01:05.758
compliance with other statutes

02:01:05.825 --> 02:01:07.627
and regulations we're looking

02:01:07.693 --> 02:01:09.395
at the information that we're

02:01:09.462 --> 02:01:10.029
getting from blade and all of

02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:11.631
the- the various of its data

02:01:11.697 --> 02:01:13.633
that in there. But we needed

02:01:13.699 --> 02:01:15.735
that report so that we could

02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:17.436
actually finalize our report. I

02:01:17.503 --> 02:01:19.538
don't have a date right now for

02:01:19.605 --> 02:01:20.172
you for when that will be done

02:01:20.239 --> 02:01:21.841
but with the receipt of the

02:01:21.907 --> 02:01:25.511
blade reported should be able

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:26.045
to. Accelerate quickly to

02:01:26.112 --> 02:01:31.584
completion. So. One of the

02:01:31.651 --> 02:01:33.719
things that that I would note

02:01:33.786 --> 02:01:37.423
about the blade report is that.

02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:38.090
Now that we know what the root

02:01:38.157 --> 02:01:39.859
cause was now that we know that

02:01:39.925 --> 02:01:41.827
that it was a casing failure we

02:01:41.894 --> 02:01:43.863
know that the regulations that

02:01:43.929 --> 02:01:45.798
we adopted first as an

02:01:45.865 --> 02:01:47.433
emergency and later as a

02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:48.100
permanent regulation that those

02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:49.769
really are getting at some of

02:01:49.835 --> 02:01:53.406
those those risk points that

02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:54.006
that are identifiable by the

02:01:54.073 --> 02:01:57.543
blade report. Blade ID I think

02:01:57.610 --> 02:01:58.177
I don't know but words in their

02:01:58.244 --> 02:01:59.745
mouth and blade actually

02:01:59.812 --> 02:02:01.747
indicated that had those

02:02:01.814 --> 02:02:03.849
regulations been in place

02:02:03.916 --> 02:02:06.018
before two thousand and fifteen

02:02:06.085 --> 02:02:07.420
the ones that we have today.

02:02:07.486 --> 02:02:07.953
That we likely would have

02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:11.424
detected the weakening in that

02:02:11.490 --> 02:02:11.991
case in wall and we likely

02:02:12.058 --> 02:02:12.558
would have been able to have

02:02:12.625 --> 02:02:13.793
prevented it so I think that

02:02:13.859 --> 02:02:15.761
that's that's a good thing for

02:02:15.828 --> 02:02:17.530
the protection of public health

02:02:17.596 --> 02:02:19.398
and safety for however long

02:02:19.465 --> 02:02:21.500
we're going to have gas storage

02:02:21.567 --> 02:02:22.134
in the state and I'm not making

02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:23.636
any any judgment I understand

02:02:23.703 --> 02:02:25.638
that the PC is going to make

02:02:25.705 --> 02:02:27.406
that determination. However

02:02:27.473 --> 02:02:28.040
long we're going to have it we

02:02:28.107 --> 02:02:29.608
need to make sure that it's

02:02:29.675 --> 02:02:33.412
going to be done safely and- I

02:02:33.479 --> 02:02:33.946
think I think that those

02:02:34.013 --> 02:02:35.648
regulations got got to that

02:02:35.715 --> 02:02:37.516
there are a couple of pieces

02:02:37.583 --> 02:02:38.150
that I also want to make sure

02:02:38.217 --> 02:02:39.618
that we're clear on and one

02:02:39.685 --> 02:02:41.754
appreciate your work. Senator

02:02:41.821 --> 02:02:43.789
on S. before sixty three is

02:02:43.856 --> 02:02:45.524
it's identifying some

02:02:45.591 --> 02:02:46.092
additional places from the

02:02:46.158 --> 02:02:49.528
blade reporting giving a sum of

02:02:49.595 --> 02:02:50.162
forty to really take a look at.

02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:51.997
When do we want to make sure we

02:02:52.064 --> 02:02:53.532
put cathodic protection into

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:55.835
these wells we need to have

02:02:55.901 --> 02:02:57.837
maintaining have and maintain

02:02:57.903 --> 02:02:59.605
individual well control plans

02:02:59.672 --> 02:03:01.640
do the calculations on the

02:03:01.707 --> 02:03:02.308
front end so you know how much

02:03:02.374 --> 02:03:03.876
blood and how much weight

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:05.511
you're gonna need to control

02:03:05.578 --> 02:03:06.078
the well. To the you're not

02:03:06.145 --> 02:03:07.680
trying to scramble about it

02:03:07.747 --> 02:03:08.247
when you've got a blow up

02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:09.882
going. Evaluations of casing

02:03:09.949 --> 02:03:13.519
failures and near misses a past

02:03:13.586 --> 02:03:14.153
practice was to say Hey you've

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:15.988
had a problem with as well fix

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:17.923
it. But not to ask the question

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:21.527
why and that needs to happen

02:03:21.594 --> 02:03:22.027
and again the chemical

02:03:22.094 --> 02:03:23.696
inventory reported so these are

02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:25.664
all areas where we're looking

02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:27.867
to update the regulations in

02:03:27.933 --> 02:03:29.902
the future we look forward as I

02:03:29.969 --> 02:03:33.606
said to making sure that if

02:03:33.672 --> 02:03:34.140
we're going to have these

02:03:34.206 --> 02:03:34.707
facilities. Let's have them

02:03:34.774 --> 02:03:39.879
safely. I thank you Mister

02:03:39.945 --> 02:03:43.849
Marshall. I had a few initial

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:44.316
question just for Mr

02:03:44.383 --> 02:03:45.684
Krishnamoorthy before moving

02:03:45.751 --> 02:03:49.555
back to the administration. I

02:03:49.622 --> 02:03:50.189
wanted to drill a little deeper

02:03:50.256 --> 02:03:55.694
if you will. Into the into a

02:03:55.761 --> 02:03:56.328
nineteen eighty eight memo that

02:03:56.395 --> 02:03:59.865
you referred to. I'm looking at

02:03:59.932 --> 02:04:01.934
page a hundred seventy four of

02:04:02.001 --> 02:04:05.538
your root cause analysis

02:04:05.604 --> 02:04:06.172
looking at the candidate wells

02:04:06.238 --> 02:04:09.542
for casing inspection the

02:04:09.608 --> 02:04:13.546
twenty flagged wells identified

02:04:13.612 --> 02:04:17.683
then by the gas company. Let me

02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:19.685
get this straight so back then

02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:20.252
it in nineteen eighty eight

02:04:20.319 --> 02:04:21.854
they flagged fifty candidate

02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:25.591
well as for casing inspection.

02:04:25.658 --> 02:04:27.927
Twenty I believe I'm sorry Sir

02:04:27.993 --> 02:04:28.460
twenty well as for casing

02:04:28.527 --> 02:04:31.664
inspection. They inspected only

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:33.766
five the inspected seven they

02:04:33.833 --> 02:04:37.837
inspected seven and found five

02:04:37.903 --> 02:04:38.437
that had correct evidence of

02:04:38.504 --> 02:04:39.905
corrosion external corrosion

02:04:39.972 --> 02:04:41.841
yes external corrosion of a

02:04:41.907 --> 02:04:44.009
microbial nature no they didn't

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:45.878
know that was that it was

02:04:45.945 --> 02:04:47.646
indeterminism determined to

02:04:47.713 --> 02:04:49.582
stop at that point yeah. I

02:04:49.648 --> 02:04:51.584
believe data pad some of them

02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:52.151
they understood their work I

02:04:52.218 --> 02:04:53.986
think they were planned and

02:04:54.053 --> 02:04:55.754
then they stopped is there

02:04:55.821 --> 02:04:57.590
evidence of their repair. I

02:04:57.656 --> 02:04:59.592
believe that is right there yes

02:04:59.658 --> 02:05:01.727
evidence of the repair of the

02:05:01.794 --> 02:05:03.963
five yeah for a couple of them

02:05:04.029 --> 02:05:05.898
out of the five right. Yes I'm

02:05:05.965 --> 02:05:09.602
in. The two of the remaining

02:05:09.668 --> 02:05:11.670
seven that did not have the

02:05:11.737 --> 02:05:12.304
external corrosion did not have

02:05:12.371 --> 02:05:14.106
external corrosion correct the

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:15.875
remaining thirteen wells.

02:05:15.941 --> 02:05:19.612
Flagged for casing inspection.

02:05:19.678 --> 02:05:20.212
Is there any evidence in the

02:05:20.279 --> 02:05:23.616
record of the gas company

02:05:23.682 --> 02:05:29.822
actually inspecting those wells.

02:05:29.889 --> 02:05:30.389
I don't believe now I don't

02:05:30.456 --> 02:05:30.890
believe any of them and

02:05:30.956 --> 02:05:33.759
inspected. And in your opinion

02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:35.661
as a standard industry practice.

02:05:35.728 --> 02:05:37.963
Is there any reason that they

02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:39.965
should not have inspected the

02:05:40.032 --> 02:05:41.967
remaining thirteen okay is so

02:05:42.034 --> 02:05:43.769
let me go back we went back to

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:44.236
say why he they first

02:05:44.303 --> 02:05:47.907
identified the twenty. And they

02:05:47.973 --> 02:05:48.540
had it delivered ability there

02:05:48.607 --> 02:05:49.975
to prioritize Isshin be

02:05:50.042 --> 02:05:51.977
identified SS twenty five for

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:53.779
example is a low priority in

02:05:53.846 --> 02:05:55.948
that list. So they did all the

02:05:56.015 --> 02:05:57.850
high priorities and perhaps one

02:05:57.917 --> 02:05:59.718
or two medium priorities and

02:05:59.785 --> 02:06:00.286
they ignored the rest some

02:06:00.352 --> 02:06:02.054
medium and some low. So that

02:06:02.121 --> 02:06:04.023
was a lot there was a logic at

02:06:04.089 --> 02:06:06.091
that point but even among the

02:06:06.158 --> 02:06:07.726
high and medium priority of the

02:06:07.793 --> 02:06:09.995
twenty. Of which SS twenty five

02:06:10.062 --> 02:06:11.730
was not one of them they still

02:06:11.797 --> 02:06:13.999
didn't even complete. That full

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:15.634
list of the twenty they only

02:06:15.701 --> 02:06:16.235
got to seven out of that one

02:06:16.302 --> 02:06:18.103
perfect and ignored thirteen.

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:20.039
Yeah they they it was quite

02:06:20.105 --> 02:06:22.074
productive those days but yes

02:06:22.141 --> 02:06:27.646
yes. But SS twenty five which

02:06:27.713 --> 02:06:28.280
was a low priority the time was

02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:31.850
not even inspected. Nor was any

02:06:31.917 --> 02:06:33.919
corrosion detected because

02:06:33.986 --> 02:06:35.654
there was no inspection correct

02:06:35.721 --> 02:06:37.723
an inmate at what a what we

02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:38.357
mean by inspection there. Is

02:06:38.424 --> 02:06:39.725
going to pull the tubing. And

02:06:39.792 --> 02:06:41.827
then you run wall thickness of

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:43.896
inspection tools that. Jason

02:06:43.963 --> 02:06:45.898
had here a few minutes ago. One

02:06:45.965 --> 02:06:47.666
of those two if you have to run

02:06:47.733 --> 02:06:49.668
we're we're the majority of

02:06:49.735 --> 02:06:50.202
those wells vintage wells

02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:52.037
another were guided weapons

02:06:52.104 --> 02:06:53.872
that are from former oil

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:55.841
production correct they're all

02:06:55.908 --> 02:06:57.843
former world about. And was SS

02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:58.444
twenty five also a former oil

02:06:58.510 --> 02:07:00.212
well correct from right what

02:07:00.279 --> 02:07:02.014
was but it still didn't make

02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:10.222
their list. For candidate wells

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:13.993
for some unknown reason. Thank

02:07:14.059 --> 02:07:14.560
you for that and I wanted to

02:07:14.626 --> 02:07:15.961
also get your input on what

02:07:16.028 --> 02:07:16.462
happened what you think

02:07:16.528 --> 02:07:17.029
happened between two PM on

02:07:17.096 --> 02:07:17.963
October twenty second when you

02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:20.165
you alluded to a slight

02:07:20.232 --> 02:07:21.967
decrease in pressure and three

02:07:22.034 --> 02:07:25.871
AM on October twenty third when

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:27.973
you said that there was a

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:28.574
detection I think you use the

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:31.877
word that they smelled it what

02:07:31.944 --> 02:07:34.079
happened in your opinion

02:07:34.146 --> 02:07:36.148
between that. And the thirteen

02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:39.852
hours okay let me make goes to

02:07:39.918 --> 02:07:40.419
back a little bit on October

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:44.089
twenty second. Two PM they shut

02:07:44.156 --> 02:07:46.125
the railing okay and there was

02:07:46.191 --> 02:07:48.093
no issues at that point you

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:48.660
look at the pressure record

02:07:48.727 --> 02:07:52.031
looks clean. Then at three oh

02:07:52.097 --> 02:07:53.966
forty M. shut the world down at

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:56.168
at two PM bishop injection to

02:07:56.235 --> 02:07:57.803
the well they said and gestured

02:07:57.870 --> 02:07:58.404
to the one that is that is

02:07:58.470 --> 02:08:00.072
standard practice yeah many of

02:08:00.139 --> 02:08:00.706
those turn it on and off in

02:08:00.773 --> 02:08:02.241
order to turn it on it so they

02:08:02.307 --> 02:08:04.076
turned it off turn it off of

02:08:04.143 --> 02:08:04.676
that. Yeah and they shut it.

02:08:04.743 --> 02:08:07.880
And so then you fast forward to

02:08:07.946 --> 02:08:09.948
three to four AM on October

02:08:10.015 --> 02:08:11.817
twenty third yes they started

02:08:11.884 --> 02:08:13.819
re injecting gas at that point.

02:08:13.886 --> 02:08:15.988
So what we've after is we know

02:08:16.055 --> 02:08:17.956
that between October twenty

02:08:18.023 --> 02:08:19.958
second two PM on October twenty

02:08:20.025 --> 02:08:23.962
third. Three AM roughly twelve

02:08:24.029 --> 02:08:24.596
hours at. Twelve fourteen hours

02:08:24.663 --> 02:08:27.966
there was no there the S. S. S.

02:08:28.033 --> 02:08:33.906
twenty five not it failed. That

02:08:33.972 --> 02:08:35.841
is what we went after. So then.

02:08:35.908 --> 02:08:38.210
October twenty third three to

02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:38.811
four AM we believe. The food

02:08:38.877 --> 02:08:40.245
axial that long failure happen

02:08:40.312 --> 02:08:41.980
sometime after that. And we

02:08:42.047 --> 02:08:43.816
think the circumferential

02:08:43.882 --> 02:08:45.818
parting because it looked cord

02:08:45.884 --> 02:08:46.452
happen at around seven or eight

02:08:46.518 --> 02:08:48.053
AM on October twenty third

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:50.055
morning. So if I go back from

02:08:50.122 --> 02:08:50.689
that it was probably an hour

02:08:50.756 --> 02:08:52.191
before the doctor happened did

02:08:52.257 --> 02:08:54.226
detect the smell the gas only

02:08:54.293 --> 02:08:56.495
at three PM on October twenty

02:08:56.562 --> 02:09:00.132
third okay so I want to clarify

02:09:00.199 --> 02:09:03.869
the time line. Understood yeah.

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:06.105
And so. This nineteen eighty

02:09:06.171 --> 02:09:07.973
eight memo. Internally was

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:11.944
ident flag those twenty wells.

02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:14.012
Five out of six seven were

02:09:14.079 --> 02:09:14.646
inspected five found external

02:09:14.713 --> 02:09:16.148
corrosion. No further

02:09:16.215 --> 02:09:21.820
inspections were done. Between

02:09:21.887 --> 02:09:22.354
nineteen eighty eight and

02:09:22.421 --> 02:09:24.356
present day. I want to kind of

02:09:24.423 --> 02:09:28.127
paraphrase that in twenty

02:09:28.193 --> 02:09:30.062
fourteen when they did the G.

02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:32.197
R. C. testimony that generate

02:09:32.264 --> 02:09:34.299
cages him like you do these

02:09:34.366 --> 02:09:36.268
opportunities PCS. They at that

02:09:36.335 --> 02:09:39.838
point they flagged some bells

02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:40.372
that they had identified

02:09:40.439 --> 02:09:42.040
external corrosion okay only

02:09:42.107 --> 02:09:43.942
way you can flag you have

02:09:44.009 --> 02:09:46.011
external corrosion is on the

02:09:46.078 --> 02:09:46.678
casing is you have to run along

02:09:46.745 --> 02:09:48.113
one of these wall thickness

02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:49.982
logs so they did do some

02:09:50.048 --> 02:09:51.984
inspections and now I don't

02:09:52.050 --> 02:09:53.852
believe they read the other

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:54.486
thirteen I I'll need to check

02:09:54.553 --> 02:09:56.155
my report again to confirm

02:09:56.221 --> 02:09:56.788
that. But there are some other

02:09:56.855 --> 02:09:58.290
wells and we looked at those

02:09:58.357 --> 02:10:00.259
wells also their identified

02:10:00.325 --> 02:10:06.398
some. Other routes and some of

02:10:06.465 --> 02:10:06.965
them had external corrosion

02:10:07.032 --> 02:10:09.968
formally so twenty six years

02:10:10.035 --> 02:10:10.569
after that initial memo they

02:10:10.636 --> 02:10:12.271
flagged a few more wells. Yeah

02:10:12.337 --> 02:10:12.871
sometime in that Peter twenty

02:10:12.938 --> 02:10:13.505
eleven twenty two a limit that

02:10:13.572 --> 02:10:14.239
inspection and yet the thirteen

02:10:14.306 --> 02:10:16.408
we still don't have evidence in

02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:17.976
the record whether they even

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:20.045
finish that old. List no there

02:10:20.112 --> 02:10:22.114
would have been as part of the

02:10:22.181 --> 02:10:23.882
post of to the battery of tests

02:10:23.949 --> 02:10:24.449
I'm sure that was covered I

02:10:24.516 --> 02:10:26.285
don't have that in my family

02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:26.785
but the show we don't

02:10:26.852 --> 02:10:28.320
necessarily have correlated

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:30.222
that. Thirteen from the list of

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:32.257
twenty two that twenty fourteen

02:10:32.324 --> 02:10:34.493
testimony. We have we have that

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:36.428
I have to go back and look at

02:10:36.495 --> 02:10:38.163
my records. Mrs tone but I can

02:10:38.230 --> 02:10:40.265
find it but the- at that time

02:10:40.332 --> 02:10:42.401
in the twenty fourteen report.

02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:46.171
I'm sorry the twenty fourteen

02:10:46.238 --> 02:10:46.738
testimony was SS twenty five

02:10:46.805 --> 02:10:52.244
flag. No it was not not. Twenty

02:10:52.311 --> 02:10:52.778
four was not flat. Because

02:10:52.844 --> 02:10:54.112
there was. A again their

02:10:54.179 --> 02:10:55.981
regulation in the practice was

02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:56.548
to run noise and temperature

02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:58.417
logs. Annual temperature logs

02:10:58.483 --> 02:11:00.185
which was run on this is twenty

02:11:00.252 --> 02:11:01.987
five every year. He does run.

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:04.089
There was no indications of any

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:04.590
leaks or anything. No

02:11:04.656 --> 02:11:06.391
indication of any leaks but is

02:11:06.458 --> 02:11:09.995
microbial corrosion a standard

02:11:10.062 --> 02:11:11.997
type of corrosion that occurs

02:11:12.064 --> 02:11:13.999
to wells especially and former

02:11:14.066 --> 02:11:16.268
oil fields. It's the day of the

02:11:16.335 --> 02:11:18.003
mechanism here is a bit unusual

02:11:18.070 --> 02:11:20.005
in SS twenty five but

02:11:20.072 --> 02:11:22.007
independent of how the

02:11:22.074 --> 02:11:22.574
corrosion happens. If you

02:11:22.641 --> 02:11:24.276
inspect the well he was he

02:11:24.343 --> 02:11:26.278
corrosion. So the inspection

02:11:26.345 --> 02:11:28.213
doesn't. Doesn't necessarily

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:28.814
tell me what mechanism it is.

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:30.315
But inspection tells you I lost

02:11:30.382 --> 02:11:32.150
some Wall. Street Richard

02:11:32.217 --> 02:11:34.086
immediately tell her. So if

02:11:34.152 --> 02:11:38.090
they had inspected but. In

02:11:38.156 --> 02:11:38.657
those twenty six years they

02:11:38.724 --> 02:11:42.060
would have found something.

02:11:42.127 --> 02:11:44.029
Likely that's most absolutely

02:11:44.096 --> 02:11:44.630
most probably they should fund

02:11:44.696 --> 02:11:45.230
yeah because it was expensive

02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:46.231
corrosion. From six hundred

02:11:46.298 --> 02:11:48.033
feet to below to nine ninety or

02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:48.634
thousand twenty five feet it

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:50.168
was external corrosion on the

02:11:50.235 --> 02:11:52.037
seven inch casing. And is it

02:11:52.104 --> 02:11:54.139
foreseeable that that well that

02:11:54.206 --> 02:11:56.041
is more than twenty six years

02:11:56.108 --> 02:11:58.043
old I believe goes back to the

02:11:58.110 --> 02:11:58.677
nineteen fifties that it would

02:11:58.744 --> 02:12:00.045
experience some corrosion

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:00.612
overtime. Need not to see

02:12:00.679 --> 02:12:02.447
that's the problem you you it

02:12:02.514 --> 02:12:04.483
depends on how to see men Ted.

02:12:04.549 --> 02:12:06.385
Depends on where the that

02:12:06.451 --> 02:12:08.353
surface casing shoe is set. So

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:10.355
the lawn of factors so you

02:12:10.422 --> 02:12:12.124
could have an order I'll have

02:12:12.190 --> 02:12:14.259
no corrosion. All you could

02:12:14.326 --> 02:12:14.860
have a new well that'll have

02:12:14.926 --> 02:12:18.030
corrosion so it is not an age

02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:18.664
dependent it's dependent on the

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:20.198
architecture dependent on. What

02:12:20.265 --> 02:12:22.301
I architecture versus twenty

02:12:22.367 --> 02:12:24.136
five I believe you said they

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:26.171
used cement case cement at the

02:12:26.238 --> 02:12:28.373
bottom. But drilling muds for

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:30.342
the remainder of the well all

02:12:30.409 --> 02:12:32.144
the way up to the surface so in

02:12:32.210 --> 02:12:34.112
that kind of formation. Is

02:12:34.179 --> 02:12:36.081
microbial corrosion a

02:12:36.148 --> 02:12:38.050
foreseeable risk external

02:12:38.116 --> 02:12:38.717
corrosion is a foreseeable risk

02:12:38.784 --> 02:12:44.156
I wouldn't say microbial. But

02:12:44.222 --> 02:12:44.790
external and internal corrosion

02:12:44.856 --> 02:12:48.226
as a foreseeable risk. And that

02:12:48.293 --> 02:12:50.329
they have a lot of data on.

02:12:50.395 --> 02:12:52.197
Today so I want to move to the

02:12:52.264 --> 02:12:52.731
department of conservation

02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:54.066
briefly so I understand that

02:12:54.132 --> 02:12:56.134
you said your investigation is

02:12:56.201 --> 02:12:58.270
still under way of your root

02:12:58.337 --> 02:13:00.072
cause analysis investigation

02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:00.639
busy phase two of this root

02:13:00.706 --> 02:13:02.174
cause not the technical route

02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:04.609
because- and you you mentioned

02:13:04.676 --> 02:13:06.478
that you were looking at their

02:13:06.545 --> 02:13:08.413
compliance. With statutes and

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.549
regulations yes that's correct

02:13:10.615 --> 02:13:12.451
are you solely looking at

02:13:12.517 --> 02:13:14.252
compliance with statutes and

02:13:14.319 --> 02:13:14.786
regulations are you also

02:13:14.853 --> 02:13:16.355
looking at standards. And

02:13:16.421 --> 02:13:18.357
practices that go beyond

02:13:18.423 --> 02:13:20.659
whatever regulations around the

02:13:20.726 --> 02:13:22.494
books at the time yes generally

02:13:22.561 --> 02:13:23.028
speaking what we would be

02:13:23.095 --> 02:13:26.298
looking at is what. What the

02:13:26.365 --> 02:13:28.100
prior regulation spoke to of

02:13:28.166 --> 02:13:30.369
good oil field practice so that

02:13:30.435 --> 02:13:32.270
the broad terms of we look to

02:13:32.337 --> 02:13:32.838
find that there's something

02:13:32.904 --> 02:13:34.573
that they could and should have

02:13:34.639 --> 02:13:36.475
been done ordinarily even if

02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:38.477
it's not spelled out that shell

02:13:38.543 --> 02:13:40.445
test. With this with this

02:13:40.512 --> 02:13:41.046
frequency we'll be looking at

02:13:41.113 --> 02:13:46.451
that. And based on your review

02:13:46.518 --> 02:13:48.186
of the current blade energy

02:13:48.253 --> 02:13:50.422
partners report do you think

02:13:50.489 --> 02:13:54.259
that the process we sound to

02:13:54.326 --> 02:13:56.461
establish the report the

02:13:56.528 --> 02:13:58.330
techniques used is the

02:13:58.397 --> 02:14:02.200
department S. at least

02:14:02.267 --> 02:14:02.801
supportive of the process for

02:14:02.868 --> 02:14:04.569
developing this technical root

02:14:04.636 --> 02:14:06.438
cause analysis I believe the

02:14:06.505 --> 02:14:08.273
department is up al Walker is

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:08.807
here are technically and I

02:14:08.874 --> 02:14:10.675
think I would concur that that

02:14:10.742 --> 02:14:12.377
the report would meet our

02:14:12.444 --> 02:14:14.279
expectations of technical so

02:14:14.346 --> 02:14:14.913
I'm seeing a yes from Mister

02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:16.648
Walker and I'll I'll take that

02:14:16.715 --> 02:14:20.352
as a yes from you. So if the

02:14:20.419 --> 02:14:24.423
process was sound have you do

02:14:24.489 --> 02:14:26.258
you agree with the conclusions.

02:14:26.324 --> 02:14:30.595
Yes and so. When can we expect

02:14:30.662 --> 02:14:34.332
this investigation to be

02:14:34.399 --> 02:14:34.966
completed of sort of phase two

02:14:35.033 --> 02:14:38.236
of this root cause analysis.

02:14:38.303 --> 02:14:38.837
I'm I'm sorry I don't have a

02:14:38.904 --> 02:14:40.605
hard date for that center one

02:14:40.672 --> 02:14:41.273
of the things that we're making

02:14:41.339 --> 02:14:42.741
sure we do for the integrity of

02:14:42.808 --> 02:14:44.576
that analysis is the people who

02:14:44.643 --> 02:14:46.445
are doing it are walled off

02:14:46.511 --> 02:14:48.480
from from other parts of the

02:14:48.547 --> 02:14:50.415
organization it's a we don't

02:14:50.482 --> 02:14:52.651
inquire of them or or try to

02:14:52.717 --> 02:14:54.719
influence their investigation

02:14:54.786 --> 02:14:56.421
any way shape or form so I will

02:14:56.488 --> 02:14:58.490
get an answer for you as to

02:14:58.557 --> 02:15:00.225
what their expectations of time

02:15:00.292 --> 02:15:02.227
one how does the walling work.

02:15:02.294 --> 02:15:04.229
There's a specific unit within

02:15:04.296 --> 02:15:06.565
dog or it's a it's a compliance

02:15:06.631 --> 02:15:08.333
unit it's generally tasked with

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:10.535
things like doing assessments

02:15:10.602 --> 02:15:12.571
of whether programs are being

02:15:12.637 --> 02:15:13.104
implemented appropriately

02:15:13.171 --> 02:15:14.639
across the organization that

02:15:14.706 --> 02:15:18.343
team was tasked with with.

02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:18.944
Setting up this is even while

02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:22.714
the. Well the well was still I

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:24.549
blowing out. They were tester

02:15:24.616 --> 02:15:26.551
Leon with with doing their work

02:15:26.618 --> 02:15:28.320
and doing it independently so

02:15:28.386 --> 02:15:30.355
they did not report to. To me

02:15:30.422 --> 02:15:32.257
or to al Walker on the response

02:15:32.324 --> 02:15:32.757
team they reported to a

02:15:32.824 --> 02:15:33.358
different a different line of

02:15:33.425 --> 02:15:36.695
command. And what is that line

02:15:36.761 --> 02:15:38.530
of the command who who do they

02:15:38.597 --> 02:15:39.164
report to at that time it would

02:15:39.231 --> 02:15:40.332
have been actually to

02:15:40.398 --> 02:15:42.267
supervisor can harass. Former

02:15:42.334 --> 02:15:42.868
supervisor can harass and can

02:15:42.934 --> 02:15:46.505
was out of the- the chain as

02:15:46.571 --> 02:15:50.275
you noted from the response.

02:15:50.342 --> 02:15:50.909
Alan I became the lead on the

02:15:50.976 --> 02:15:52.777
response for further so canyon

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:54.746
and other operations of doctor

02:15:54.813 --> 02:15:56.548
where the of the willing as

02:15:56.615 --> 02:15:58.450
supervisors responsibility. So

02:15:58.517 --> 02:16:00.418
did did then supervisor Harris

02:16:00.485 --> 02:16:02.654
as he had a hand in developing

02:16:02.721 --> 02:16:04.389
this secondary root cause

02:16:04.456 --> 02:16:06.391
analysis I believe that it's

02:16:06.458 --> 02:16:08.293
been entirely done by the staff

02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:08.927
in that compliance is solely by

02:16:08.994 --> 02:16:10.662
the staff not by then

02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:12.430
supervisor careers. I know

02:16:12.497 --> 02:16:14.499
we've had issues. That have

02:16:14.566 --> 02:16:16.535
emerged around conflicts of

02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:18.503
interest within the division of

02:16:18.570 --> 02:16:19.004
oil gas and geothermal

02:16:19.070 --> 02:16:20.805
recovery. And that supervisor

02:16:20.872 --> 02:16:24.543
Harris's been relieved of his

02:16:24.609 --> 02:16:30.448
duty as a result. But my

02:16:30.515 --> 02:16:32.551
question for you is it Hey have

02:16:32.617 --> 02:16:34.386
you were now is the acting

02:16:34.452 --> 02:16:36.788
supervisor have you assessed

02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:38.623
any potential conflicts of

02:16:38.690 --> 02:16:40.458
interest within this staff

02:16:40.525 --> 02:16:42.527
conducting this final phase of

02:16:42.594 --> 02:16:43.094
the root cause analysis is

02:16:43.161 --> 02:16:48.500
there some way to ascertain.

02:16:48.567 --> 02:16:50.569
Whether they have any stock or

02:16:50.635 --> 02:16:52.671
financial interests in oil and

02:16:52.737 --> 02:16:54.839
gas in any way shape or form

02:16:54.906 --> 02:16:56.908
yes we've accused all of the

02:16:56.975 --> 02:16:58.777
staff who had any any hint of

02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:00.745
interest and energy issues not

02:17:00.812 --> 02:17:04.482
just oil and gas but energy

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:05.050
issues we've had all of them

02:17:05.116 --> 02:17:06.484
accused from any regulating

02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:08.553
inspecting. Oversight of oil

02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:10.622
and gas operations and that's

02:17:10.689 --> 02:17:11.222
been ongoing since day one of

02:17:11.289 --> 02:17:14.726
my acting role. At the that

02:17:14.793 --> 02:17:16.494
something will be following up

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:17.095
on subsequently through this

02:17:17.162 --> 02:17:18.697
committee and we'll look

02:17:18.763 --> 02:17:20.832
forward to future conversations

02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:24.436
about how to. Rebuild trust

02:17:24.502 --> 02:17:26.638
with Dogger in. Taking us

02:17:26.705 --> 02:17:28.740
another look at. The mission of

02:17:28.807 --> 02:17:32.544
dog. Vision of oil gas and

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:34.479
geothermal recovery is

02:17:34.546 --> 02:17:36.648
currently the name of the

02:17:36.715 --> 02:17:38.783
agency it is an agency in my

02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:40.685
view that the statute has

02:17:40.752 --> 02:17:42.754
mistakenly assigned with the

02:17:42.821 --> 02:17:46.558
mission of recovering oil and

02:17:46.625 --> 02:17:47.192
gas and that that has been the

02:17:47.259 --> 02:17:48.426
mission up to this point.

02:17:48.493 --> 02:17:50.629
Because they're within the

02:17:50.695 --> 02:17:52.430
department of conservation

02:17:52.497 --> 02:17:52.764
there is legislation. And

02:17:52.831 --> 02:17:56.901
possible you know. On the fossa

02:17:56.968 --> 02:17:58.870
with the passive on the fossil

02:17:58.937 --> 02:17:59.437
fuel industry while we have

02:17:59.504 --> 02:18:00.071
this dependence on that form of

02:18:00.138 --> 02:18:03.008
energy. Do you think that

02:18:03.074 --> 02:18:03.575
doctors mission needs to be

02:18:03.642 --> 02:18:08.813
updated. I think there have I

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:09.381
think everybody would agree

02:18:09.447 --> 02:18:11.116
that dog you're at as a

02:18:11.182 --> 02:18:12.984
regulatory regulatory agency

02:18:13.051 --> 02:18:16.821
can continue to improve. I will

02:18:16.888 --> 02:18:18.823
say you know with the center

02:18:18.890 --> 02:18:20.659
Pavel is leadership on as

02:18:20.725 --> 02:18:21.159
before with legislative

02:18:21.226 --> 02:18:22.927
leadership with governor

02:18:22.994 --> 02:18:26.865
brown's leadership. A lot has

02:18:26.931 --> 02:18:27.499
improved a dog it now actually

02:18:27.565 --> 02:18:30.869
has a strong regulatory

02:18:30.935 --> 02:18:32.804
enforcement program. As we

02:18:32.871 --> 02:18:34.773
talked about here today it's

02:18:34.839 --> 02:18:35.407
passed to some of the strongest

02:18:35.473 --> 02:18:38.877
regulations in the country but

02:18:38.943 --> 02:18:39.477
absolutely we have to do more

02:18:39.544 --> 02:18:43.048
and we will. When I heard the

02:18:43.114 --> 02:18:44.683
from doctor Krishnamoorthy an

02:18:44.749 --> 02:18:47.085
apology is Ravi but your doctor

02:18:47.152 --> 02:18:49.254
here. There are certain risks

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:52.691
that simply cannot be mitigated

02:18:52.757 --> 02:18:54.893
when it comes to oil and gas.

02:18:54.959 --> 02:18:56.995
And is strong is daughters new

02:18:57.062 --> 02:18:58.897
regulations may be and we may

02:18:58.963 --> 02:19:01.066
pass subsequent legislation

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:04.869
requiring. More additional

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:06.705
cathartic pressed protections

02:19:06.771 --> 02:19:07.338
and other pressure testing and

02:19:07.405 --> 02:19:12.844
other failure analyses.

02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:13.445
Corrosion happens that's just

02:19:13.511 --> 02:19:18.883
what happens with the well. So.

02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:20.885
How what what what guarantee

02:19:20.952 --> 02:19:23.021
can we give to the people who

02:19:23.088 --> 02:19:23.655
live here in the San Fernando

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:26.891
Valley that there will never be

02:19:26.958 --> 02:19:29.160
another blow out or leak ever

02:19:29.227 --> 02:19:32.797
again here at this field. Well

02:19:32.864 --> 02:19:33.398
listen I think you've asked a

02:19:33.465 --> 02:19:34.999
question broadly about the you

02:19:35.066 --> 02:19:37.035
know risk factors of fossil

02:19:37.102 --> 02:19:38.970
fuel and I think you heard me

02:19:39.037 --> 02:19:41.306
validate what you open that the

02:19:41.372 --> 02:19:43.041
hearing with which is where all

02:19:43.108 --> 02:19:43.641
collectively working to reduce

02:19:43.708 --> 02:19:46.911
our dependence on fossil fuel.

02:19:46.978 --> 02:19:48.847
At the same time it's a

02:19:48.913 --> 02:19:51.015
transition. You know as I

02:19:51.082 --> 02:19:53.118
understand it over nine million

02:19:53.184 --> 02:19:55.019
people in the base and get

02:19:55.086 --> 02:19:55.653
natural gas at least partially

02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:57.122
from this facility. And

02:19:57.188 --> 02:19:58.890
reasonable people can argue

02:19:58.957 --> 02:20:01.159
about its its centrality to the

02:20:01.226 --> 02:20:04.829
supply of that natural gas. But

02:20:04.896 --> 02:20:06.998
come this winter Angelenos will

02:20:07.065 --> 02:20:07.565
have their homes heated with

02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:09.200
natural gas in the cook tonight

02:20:09.267 --> 02:20:11.102
with natural gas. I took a lift

02:20:11.169 --> 02:20:13.071
here it was not electric

02:20:13.138 --> 02:20:15.140
vehicle it uses gas. I and so

02:20:15.206 --> 02:20:17.008
the question is how to we

02:20:17.075 --> 02:20:19.177
continue to utilize fossil

02:20:19.244 --> 02:20:21.246
fuels in the safest way

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:24.949
possible. With as smaller

02:20:25.016 --> 02:20:27.085
carbon footprint as possible

02:20:27.152 --> 02:20:28.953
until we can actually involve

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:33.091
not to reduce our dependence

02:20:33.158 --> 02:20:33.691
and move on to a D. carbonized

02:20:33.758 --> 02:20:36.995
economy. So I guess. I would

02:20:37.061 --> 02:20:40.865
just ask do you have a position.

02:20:40.932 --> 02:20:43.101
Did the governor is made public

02:20:43.168 --> 02:20:44.836
commitments and private

02:20:44.903 --> 02:20:45.436
commitments to the people in

02:20:45.503 --> 02:20:47.205
this room myself and in public

02:20:47.272 --> 02:20:49.307
on the closure of a lease can

02:20:49.374 --> 02:20:51.376
and is that a line with. The

02:20:51.442 --> 02:20:55.013
agency's policy. I'll be

02:20:55.079 --> 02:20:59.083
straightforward which is the C.

02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.517
P. U. C. which has a

02:20:59.584 --> 02:21:02.854
responsibility to ensure safety

02:21:02.921 --> 02:21:04.923
and reliability of energy. Is

02:21:04.989 --> 02:21:08.860
right now engaged in a public

02:21:08.927 --> 02:21:11.029
process to determine there you

02:21:11.095 --> 02:21:12.931
know whether Lee so canyon is

02:21:12.997 --> 02:21:16.901
necessary. In our system and I

02:21:16.968 --> 02:21:19.170
respect that process and we

02:21:19.237 --> 02:21:19.737
need to what we need to see

02:21:19.804 --> 02:21:24.843
that process play out. An so

02:21:24.909 --> 02:21:31.182
folks folks I hear you I hear

02:21:31.249 --> 02:21:34.853
you all. We may bring you all

02:21:34.919 --> 02:21:38.857
back up in a second but my

02:21:38.923 --> 02:21:43.061
final question was. There are

02:21:43.127 --> 02:21:47.031
still wells they're on a casing

02:21:47.098 --> 02:21:49.133
failure map fact from nineteen

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:50.869
eighty eight that have also

02:21:50.935 --> 02:21:53.137
been noted in twenty fourteen

02:21:53.204 --> 02:21:53.638
testimony to the public

02:21:53.705 --> 02:21:56.975
utilities commission that maze

02:21:57.041 --> 02:22:00.879
have the same risks that SS

02:22:00.945 --> 02:22:01.512
twenty five did is that correct

02:22:01.579 --> 02:22:02.981
Debbie director Marshall. Any

02:22:03.047 --> 02:22:05.049
of the wells that were

02:22:05.116 --> 02:22:07.151
identified in in prior years as

02:22:07.218 --> 02:22:09.087
having corrosion issues or

02:22:09.153 --> 02:22:11.222
potential defects. If they are

02:22:11.289 --> 02:22:15.159
not already plugged in an

02:22:15.226 --> 02:22:17.228
abandoned are you one of the

02:22:17.295 --> 02:22:19.297
forties. I want to make sure I

02:22:19.364 --> 02:22:20.965
don't misstate the numbers one

02:22:21.032 --> 02:22:23.301
of the forty four I believe it

02:22:23.368 --> 02:22:27.205
was. Wells that means that they

02:22:27.272 --> 02:22:29.073
have been repaired and they

02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:29.607
have been able to pass the

02:22:29.674 --> 02:22:31.342
battery of tests that

02:22:31.409 --> 02:22:33.011
determined that that there

02:22:33.077 --> 02:22:34.946
isn't a corrosion problem. In

02:22:35.013 --> 02:22:35.546
the casing that that has been

02:22:35.613 --> 02:22:38.883
had been fixed. But doctor

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:39.517
Krishnamoorthy said that there

02:22:39.584 --> 02:22:41.219
can still be corrosion not from

02:22:41.286 --> 02:22:42.987
within the casing but

02:22:43.054 --> 02:22:45.156
externally even on. The wells

02:22:45.223 --> 02:22:45.723
that are determined to have

02:22:45.790 --> 02:22:47.058
integrity internally is that

02:22:47.125 --> 02:22:47.725
correct that is correct and the

02:22:47.792 --> 02:22:49.327
testing regime that we are

02:22:49.394 --> 02:22:51.229
putting these wells through

02:22:51.296 --> 02:22:53.264
text corrosion both internally

02:22:53.331 --> 02:22:55.133
and externally so. So if. If

02:22:55.199 --> 02:22:57.468
new construction had had a

02:22:57.535 --> 02:22:59.537
repair work had been done on

02:22:59.604 --> 02:23:01.406
wells and overtime corrosion

02:23:01.472 --> 02:23:05.076
begins to occur. Then

02:23:05.143 --> 02:23:05.576
subsequent testing will

02:23:05.643 --> 02:23:09.113
identify that and direct work

02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:11.182
again the predictive nature of

02:23:11.249 --> 02:23:13.084
the what we call the battery to

02:23:13.151 --> 02:23:15.086
testing is. Really important to

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:17.221
us so how many of the

02:23:17.288 --> 02:23:19.357
identified wells have not yet

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:23.061
been plugged in a band in.

02:23:23.127 --> 02:23:25.296
There is he said forty three

02:23:25.363 --> 02:23:25.863
have been plugged there are

02:23:25.930 --> 02:23:26.464
many how many are there still

02:23:26.531 --> 02:23:27.398
to go sixty six wells have

02:23:27.465 --> 02:23:27.966
passed all the tests and are

02:23:28.032 --> 02:23:28.533
approved for service. Forty

02:23:28.599 --> 02:23:31.235
three wells taken out of

02:23:31.302 --> 02:23:33.137
service employed with cement

02:23:33.204 --> 02:23:33.771
but there's surface restoration

02:23:33.838 --> 02:23:37.041
that still needs to be done.

02:23:37.108 --> 02:23:39.177
For wells so that's up to forty

02:23:39.243 --> 02:23:39.811
seven have been plugged in with

02:23:39.877 --> 02:23:41.279
full service restoration and

02:23:41.346 --> 02:23:43.448
there is one more that is being

02:23:43.514 --> 02:23:45.383
clogged so that will take it up

02:23:45.450 --> 02:23:47.318
to a total of forty eight when

02:23:47.385 --> 02:23:47.952
that one is complete. And when

02:23:48.019 --> 02:23:51.189
will those remaining five the

02:23:51.255 --> 02:23:51.856
four that have been plugged in

02:23:51.923 --> 02:23:53.458
the one that is being plugged

02:23:53.524 --> 02:23:55.493
when do you expect those to be.

02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:57.362
Abandoned I'm sorry I think I

02:23:57.428 --> 02:23:59.364
would it makes those up the

02:23:59.430 --> 02:23:59.897
four walls that have been

02:23:59.964 --> 02:24:01.366
plugged with full service

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:03.034
restoration no for the work

02:24:03.101 --> 02:24:05.136
will be needed on this okay

02:24:05.203 --> 02:24:05.737
it's the- the forty three was

02:24:05.803 --> 02:24:07.538
taken out of service plugged

02:24:07.605 --> 02:24:08.106
with cement but the service

02:24:08.172 --> 02:24:09.340
restoration still needs to be

02:24:09.407 --> 02:24:11.142
completed on the one. Other

02:24:11.209 --> 02:24:13.111
isolated from the formation and

02:24:13.177 --> 02:24:13.644
needs to have the plugin

02:24:13.711 --> 02:24:17.115
completed those forty four. I'd

02:24:17.181 --> 02:24:21.319
ask Alice el do you have any

02:24:21.386 --> 02:24:21.953
indication on the time line for

02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:25.390
those. I Mister Harris your

02:24:25.456 --> 02:24:27.425
welcome to just. If you don't

02:24:27.492 --> 02:24:29.427
mind I'm sorry thank you Sir

02:24:29.494 --> 02:24:31.162
it's okay a Walker a technical.

02:24:31.229 --> 02:24:31.696
Lead on those yes. Mister

02:24:31.763 --> 02:24:35.500
Walker. Thank you Sir okay yeah

02:24:35.566 --> 02:24:36.034
on its own Walker from the

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:37.101
division of oil gas and

02:24:37.168 --> 02:24:39.037
geothermal resources. There's

02:24:39.103 --> 02:24:41.305
one well. It's the ward three

02:24:41.372 --> 02:24:43.174
wealth that they've had to side

02:24:43.241 --> 02:24:45.376
track. They've spent about

02:24:45.443 --> 02:24:47.178
twenty million dollars on that

02:24:47.245 --> 02:24:49.247
well at this point in time. And

02:24:49.313 --> 02:24:51.149
they appears to me that that's

02:24:51.215 --> 02:24:53.051
probably going to be. Finally

02:24:53.117 --> 02:24:55.053
plugged in abandoned without

02:24:55.119 --> 02:24:57.255
service restoration. By the end

02:24:57.321 --> 02:24:59.457
of August and can you do what

02:24:59.524 --> 02:25:01.359
does that mean when you plug in

02:25:01.426 --> 02:25:01.826
a band without surface

02:25:01.893 --> 02:25:05.363
restoration. That means they

02:25:05.430 --> 02:25:07.231
haven't gone back and recreated

02:25:07.298 --> 02:25:09.434
the surface to the condition it

02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:13.371
was. Before they installed the

02:25:13.438 --> 02:25:17.141
well site. So it's so surface

02:25:17.208 --> 02:25:17.742
integrity in other words if

02:25:17.809 --> 02:25:19.310
there would be thank you would

02:25:19.377 --> 02:25:19.977
look like nothing ever happened

02:25:20.044 --> 02:25:23.147
that's right and so what will

02:25:23.214 --> 02:25:23.748
it look like if you do not

02:25:23.815 --> 02:25:25.516
restore it to its going to look

02:25:25.583 --> 02:25:27.318
like the well sites that you

02:25:27.385 --> 02:25:29.420
have now. Except it's gonna be

02:25:29.487 --> 02:25:31.122
cut off below the surface and

02:25:31.189 --> 02:25:33.591
then fill back in with the- or

02:25:33.658 --> 02:25:37.595
cement. Changes it'll be a flat

02:25:37.662 --> 02:25:39.230
spot on the side of the hill

02:25:39.297 --> 02:25:41.265
and that twenty million that

02:25:41.332 --> 02:25:41.866
you're saying for. I'm sorry

02:25:41.933 --> 02:25:43.668
towards three in ordering that

02:25:43.734 --> 02:25:45.336
and that that's where the

02:25:45.403 --> 02:25:47.238
plucking is still under way but

02:25:47.305 --> 02:25:47.905
not yet complete that's right.

02:25:47.972 --> 02:25:51.642
Where exactly where abouts in

02:25:51.709 --> 02:25:53.411
the field is that. Give a sense

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:57.248
I don't have since okay. But it

02:25:57.315 --> 02:25:59.183
is a so cal gas well caresses

02:25:59.250 --> 02:26:03.187
at and so. What what is that

02:26:03.254 --> 02:26:03.788
you alluded to twenty million

02:26:03.855 --> 02:26:05.189
what what does that refer to

02:26:05.256 --> 02:26:07.458
that's how much they spent in

02:26:07.525 --> 02:26:09.494
order to properly plugin

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:11.329
abandoned at well. And so

02:26:11.395 --> 02:26:13.564
they've been unsuccessful with

02:26:13.631 --> 02:26:15.333
that expenditure and those

02:26:15.399 --> 02:26:17.535
efforts why well it's been it's

02:26:17.602 --> 02:26:18.102
been a very problematic well

02:26:18.169 --> 02:26:21.506
because there was. There were

02:26:21.572 --> 02:26:23.474
some mechanical of problems in

02:26:23.541 --> 02:26:25.409
the well they had to

02:26:25.476 --> 02:26:27.445
essentially do very much like

02:26:27.512 --> 02:26:28.079
what they did with the lease of

02:26:28.146 --> 02:26:29.647
canyon or with SS twenty five.

02:26:29.714 --> 02:26:31.616
Which is the come out of the

02:26:31.682 --> 02:26:33.551
wellbore side track and then

02:26:33.618 --> 02:26:35.253
come back into the well war. Re

02:26:35.319 --> 02:26:39.357
intercept and then pump the

02:26:39.423 --> 02:26:39.924
cement into the well through

02:26:39.991 --> 02:26:41.325
that would that matter. And so

02:26:41.392 --> 02:26:43.594
that those efforts have not

02:26:43.661 --> 02:26:47.431
been successful. At this point

02:26:47.498 --> 02:26:47.999
they're almost done at this

02:26:48.065 --> 02:26:51.269
point. So is there any risk of

02:26:51.335 --> 02:26:53.471
blow out or leak in the interim

02:26:53.538 --> 02:26:57.308
period. No it's plugged with

02:26:57.375 --> 02:26:57.808
cement okay across all

02:26:57.875 --> 02:27:01.345
perforations and they're in the

02:27:01.412 --> 02:27:01.913
process of plugging back the

02:27:01.979 --> 02:27:05.383
intercept well. So there the

02:27:05.449 --> 02:27:07.285
remaining work to be done is to

02:27:07.351 --> 02:27:09.287
seal it for good but the

02:27:09.353 --> 02:27:09.887
plugging is already occurred.

02:27:09.954 --> 02:27:11.689
The plugging in the interval

02:27:11.756 --> 02:27:15.226
where the gas could be produced

02:27:15.293 --> 02:27:15.760
in the cap rock has been

02:27:15.826 --> 02:27:17.495
completed and now they're

02:27:17.562 --> 02:27:19.430
working their way up the will

02:27:19.497 --> 02:27:23.234
work to. Ensure there's- no

02:27:23.301 --> 02:27:25.203
possibility of contamination of

02:27:25.269 --> 02:27:25.770
ground water and stuff like

02:27:25.836 --> 02:27:29.307
that understood and those those

02:27:29.373 --> 02:27:31.209
dollars that are being expended

02:27:31.275 --> 02:27:33.211
right now by the gas company

02:27:33.277 --> 02:27:33.878
that twenty million in addition

02:27:33.945 --> 02:27:37.281
to the many other. Millions of

02:27:37.348 --> 02:27:39.217
dollars they've spent in this

02:27:39.283 --> 02:27:41.586
plugging in abandoning process

02:27:41.652 --> 02:27:45.623
for the. Sixty six wells that

02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:47.592
have passed the forty three

02:27:47.658 --> 02:27:51.596
that. Have been. Plugged the

02:27:51.662 --> 02:27:53.564
remaining. For and then this

02:27:53.631 --> 02:27:57.468
one for ward three. Those those

02:27:57.535 --> 02:28:01.239
are all be accounted for by the

02:28:01.305 --> 02:28:01.806
administration I believe by

02:28:01.872 --> 02:28:03.507
doggerel by the public

02:28:03.574 --> 02:28:05.576
utilities commission and being

02:28:05.643 --> 02:28:07.345
that they're not automatically

02:28:07.411 --> 02:28:07.912
being passed through to rate

02:28:07.979 --> 02:28:09.580
payers correct is that is that

02:28:09.647 --> 02:28:11.415
part of the accounting process

02:28:11.482 --> 02:28:13.384
we wouldn't keep track of how

02:28:13.451 --> 02:28:13.985
much they're spending on that

02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:15.586
we said we set the requirement

02:28:15.653 --> 02:28:17.355
for making sure the plugin gets

02:28:17.421 --> 02:28:19.257
done properly. But I believe

02:28:19.323 --> 02:28:21.292
that I defer to the P. C. L. to

02:28:21.359 --> 02:28:21.892
whether they're taking those

02:28:21.959 --> 02:28:23.494
dollar amounts okay thank you

02:28:23.561 --> 02:28:25.396
do you mind. Sir just

02:28:25.463 --> 02:28:27.531
commenting thank you Mister

02:28:27.598 --> 02:28:31.469
Walker Preciado it there I know

02:28:31.535 --> 02:28:32.069
there is a sort of a running

02:28:32.136 --> 02:28:35.339
account of all expenditures

02:28:35.406 --> 02:28:37.341
related to a lease so canyon

02:28:37.408 --> 02:28:39.510
the response recovery and then

02:28:39.577 --> 02:28:41.512
the clean up is that are these

02:28:41.579 --> 02:28:45.349
kinds of costs being. Accounted

02:28:45.416 --> 02:28:49.854
for. Yes it's been accounted

02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:51.789
for and energy division it's an

02:28:51.856 --> 02:28:53.624
involved in that they're

02:28:53.691 --> 02:28:55.559
tracking it. My section to see

02:28:55.626 --> 02:28:56.193
can enforcement. Does not have

02:28:56.260 --> 02:28:57.795
a dozen track that under budget

02:28:57.862 --> 02:28:59.430
again did you division has. And

02:28:59.497 --> 02:29:01.532
so even though I don't want you

02:29:01.599 --> 02:29:02.033
to speak for the energy

02:29:02.099 --> 02:29:03.701
division those costs are not

02:29:03.768 --> 02:29:07.371
being automatically passed

02:29:07.438 --> 02:29:07.972
through to ratepayers at this

02:29:08.039 --> 02:29:11.409
point. They're being set aside.

02:29:11.475 --> 02:29:13.544
To be Frank I don't know the

02:29:13.611 --> 02:29:15.379
status of those okay my

02:29:15.446 --> 02:29:15.913
colleagues had the energy

02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:17.682
division was speak. Correctly

02:29:17.748 --> 02:29:19.684
about days I have them okay.

02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:21.519
Would you mind getting back to

02:29:21.585 --> 02:29:22.119
the committee or or asking

02:29:22.186 --> 02:29:23.788
Mister Randolph for someone at

02:29:23.854 --> 02:29:25.556
the energy division to let us

02:29:25.623 --> 02:29:27.525
know. I will certainly do that

02:29:27.591 --> 02:29:29.427
my thank you I might my into my

02:29:29.493 --> 02:29:31.462
understanding is that all costs

02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:35.533
associated. Are being tallied

02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:36.133
Natchez Talbert set aside and

02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:39.403
then. The decision about

02:29:39.470 --> 02:29:40.004
whether they will be passed

02:29:40.071 --> 02:29:41.672
through to rate payers will be

02:29:41.739 --> 02:29:42.239
highly dependent on some of

02:29:42.306 --> 02:29:43.641
these I eyes but- I'd

02:29:43.708 --> 02:29:45.443
appreciate that feedback. I

02:29:45.509 --> 02:29:46.010
will follow up thank you Sir

02:29:46.077 --> 02:29:49.613
thank at this point. So member

02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:51.782
Smith I know this was this

02:29:51.849 --> 02:29:53.417
panel was sort of the-

02:29:53.484 --> 02:29:54.018
jurisdiction of our committee

02:29:54.085 --> 02:29:57.755
so up thank you for the

02:29:57.822 --> 02:30:03.427
indulgence of letting me. Go

02:30:03.494 --> 02:30:04.028
deep here but did you have any

02:30:04.095 --> 02:30:04.662
in into additional comments. No

02:30:04.729 --> 02:30:05.663
it is I have a comment that

02:30:05.730 --> 02:30:06.230
actually ends up being an

02:30:06.297 --> 02:30:07.431
observation for the portion

02:30:07.498 --> 02:30:09.433
that I'm going to get to later

02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:11.569
news for first panel. Spoke

02:30:11.635 --> 02:30:13.838
about the need for from the

02:30:13.904 --> 02:30:15.740
beginning of the root cause

02:30:15.806 --> 02:30:17.808
analysis through then what were

02:30:17.875 --> 02:30:19.643
the remediation plans for the

02:30:19.710 --> 02:30:21.412
site the facility. The

02:30:21.479 --> 02:30:23.481
importance of data. And the

02:30:23.547 --> 02:30:25.483
importance of the fact that the

02:30:25.549 --> 02:30:26.150
initial data that was captured

02:30:26.217 --> 02:30:27.551
and collected with an

02:30:27.618 --> 02:30:29.687
undisturbed site from the time

02:30:29.754 --> 02:30:31.555
of the blow out all the way

02:30:31.622 --> 02:30:32.189
through this process has been

02:30:32.256 --> 02:30:33.657
significantly important in

02:30:33.724 --> 02:30:35.493
promoting. Public health and

02:30:35.559 --> 02:30:36.093
safety and I want us to keep

02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:37.728
that in mind the significance

02:30:37.795 --> 02:30:39.663
of having a clean data set when

02:30:39.730 --> 02:30:40.197
it comes to protecting the

02:30:40.264 --> 02:30:49.507
public's health. All right. If

02:30:49.573 --> 02:30:51.575
you don't mind sticking around

02:30:51.642 --> 02:30:53.444
in case there are some further

02:30:53.511 --> 02:30:54.078
questions but we're gonna move

02:30:54.145 --> 02:30:55.846
on to the next panel thank you

02:30:55.913 --> 02:30:56.347
Mister secretary deputy

02:30:56.414 --> 02:30:59.517
director. Dr Krishnamoorthy for

02:30:59.583 --> 02:31:03.454
all your work. Thank you all.

02:31:03.521 --> 02:31:07.591
Next we're gonna call up. We're

02:31:07.658 --> 02:31:11.429
gonna call up bread lane the

02:31:11.495 --> 02:31:11.996
chief executive officer of

02:31:12.062 --> 02:31:15.466
southern California gas company.

02:31:15.533 --> 02:31:17.635
Brianna morning the senior

02:31:17.701 --> 02:31:21.439
scientist of Lyndon wildlife

02:31:21.505 --> 02:31:22.006
and climate programs at the

02:31:22.072 --> 02:31:22.540
natural resources defense

02:31:22.606 --> 02:31:29.613
council and then. Dr Matt

02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:31.615
Matthew D. Alessio from cal

02:31:31.682 --> 02:31:37.521
state university Northridge. I

02:31:37.588 --> 02:31:39.657
think we've got yes. How don't

02:31:39.723 --> 02:31:43.627
worry. Thank you for your

02:31:43.694 --> 02:31:45.463
patience and your indulgence

02:31:45.529 --> 02:31:46.130
here we know you all have very

02:31:46.197 --> 02:31:47.765
busy schedules and- I think the

02:31:47.832 --> 02:31:49.500
whole community appreciates.

02:31:49.567 --> 02:31:55.639
Your patience. My first

02:31:55.706 --> 02:31:59.810
question. Was for the CEO of

02:31:59.877 --> 02:32:03.714
the gas company. But they're

02:32:03.781 --> 02:32:09.820
not here. I don't know what

02:32:09.887 --> 02:32:13.724
they have to hide. Or why they

02:32:13.791 --> 02:32:15.860
wouldn't be willing to testify

02:32:15.926 --> 02:32:16.527
at hearing like this we do know

02:32:16.594 --> 02:32:19.964
that there is an immense amount

02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.498
of litigation against the

02:32:20.564 --> 02:32:21.799
company at this point. And so

02:32:21.866 --> 02:32:23.868
there may have been some legal

02:32:23.934 --> 02:32:24.468
risk to a public testimony at

02:32:24.535 --> 02:32:29.607
this point. But you can. Rest

02:32:29.673 --> 02:32:31.709
assured that this committee.

02:32:31.775 --> 02:32:35.613
Will be following up. With

02:32:35.679 --> 02:32:39.517
Mister lane as well as Sempra

02:32:39.583 --> 02:32:40.117
soliciting documents that we

02:32:40.184 --> 02:32:41.986
feel are in the public interest

02:32:42.052 --> 02:32:45.689
including documents that are.

02:32:45.756 --> 02:32:47.858
Currently pending in discovery

02:32:47.925 --> 02:32:49.527
and class action another

02:32:49.593 --> 02:32:51.629
nuisance and negligence

02:32:51.695 --> 02:32:53.631
litigation that we feel deserve

02:32:53.697 --> 02:32:57.568
to be publicly disclosed. So in

02:32:57.635 --> 02:32:59.870
the weeks ahead you can expect

02:32:59.937 --> 02:33:03.574
a letter to be forthcoming to

02:33:03.641 --> 02:33:05.843
the CEO of the gas company and-

02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:09.613
I would invite. Our press and

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:11.949
our public to offer us their

02:33:12.016 --> 02:33:13.951
input as well so that we can

02:33:14.018 --> 02:33:16.020
maximize the scrutiny that is

02:33:16.086 --> 02:33:19.623
well deserved on Mister lane

02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:21.759
and the entire company as to

02:33:21.825 --> 02:33:22.393
what they intend to do to make

02:33:22.459 --> 02:33:23.961
this right and I can tell you

02:33:24.028 --> 02:33:25.963
sending twenty five million

02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:29.700
dollars to a bunch of Terry di

02:33:29.767 --> 02:33:30.301
gestures in the Central Valley

02:33:30.367 --> 02:33:37.675
does not make this right. So.

02:33:37.741 --> 02:33:41.645
I'm going to start off with. Ms

02:33:41.712 --> 02:33:47.651
the doctor Mordecai I'm sorry.

02:33:47.718 --> 02:33:49.653
So our our senior scientist

02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:50.187
here with the naturist or

02:33:50.254 --> 02:33:51.889
defense counsel because we're

02:33:51.956 --> 02:33:54.091
we're a little short on time

02:33:54.158 --> 02:33:56.026
we're gonna ask you to limit

02:33:56.093 --> 02:33:57.761
each of your testimony to ten

02:33:57.828 --> 02:33:59.897
minutes and then we can follow

02:33:59.964 --> 02:34:00.497
up with questions if that's

02:34:00.564 --> 02:34:03.734
acceptable so please miss more

02:34:03.801 --> 02:34:04.368
to proceed and then we'll move

02:34:04.435 --> 02:34:05.869
to doctor dilisio thank you so

02:34:05.936 --> 02:34:07.838
much great thank you yeah thank

02:34:07.905 --> 02:34:09.640
you for having me here today

02:34:09.707 --> 02:34:11.642
and I'm specially when I think.

02:34:11.709 --> 02:34:12.209
Of the community members for

02:34:12.276 --> 02:34:13.877
being here and sharing their

02:34:13.944 --> 02:34:15.646
experiences of what it was like

02:34:15.713 --> 02:34:16.280
to actually live through this

02:34:16.347 --> 02:34:17.848
because obviously all the dry

02:34:17.915 --> 02:34:19.750
facts and figures that we're

02:34:19.817 --> 02:34:20.317
presenting here today can't

02:34:20.384 --> 02:34:23.654
capture that the lease canyon

02:34:23.721 --> 02:34:24.254
the four month leak at the

02:34:24.321 --> 02:34:25.990
least cannon underground

02:34:26.056 --> 02:34:27.658
natural gas storage facility

02:34:27.725 --> 02:34:28.258
was environmental and public

02:34:28.325 --> 02:34:31.762
health disaster. And as we've

02:34:31.829 --> 02:34:32.363
heard in vivid detail here

02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:34.098
today it's an ongoing disaster

02:34:34.164 --> 02:34:35.833
for the people who live in this

02:34:35.899 --> 02:34:37.935
community as the root cause

02:34:38.002 --> 02:34:39.803
analysis reveals longstanding

02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:41.672
flaws and inadequacies in the

02:34:41.739 --> 02:34:43.941
regulation of regulation and

02:34:44.008 --> 02:34:45.676
oversight of these facilities

02:34:45.743 --> 02:34:46.243
was a primary contributing

02:34:46.310 --> 02:34:48.012
factor to the events that

02:34:48.078 --> 02:34:50.247
occurred. Through some of the

02:34:50.314 --> 02:34:52.082
efforts of a senator stern and

02:34:52.149 --> 02:34:55.753
others and legislation the

02:34:55.819 --> 02:34:56.353
division is taken significant

02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:57.955
steps to correct the

02:34:58.022 --> 02:34:59.957
shortcomings but more work

02:35:00.024 --> 02:35:01.759
remains to be done and

02:35:01.825 --> 02:35:03.761
ultimately the adequacy of

02:35:03.827 --> 02:35:07.931
these changes. Can only be

02:35:07.998 --> 02:35:08.532
judged on the basis of future

02:35:08.599 --> 02:35:14.004
performance. US I'm gonna go

02:35:14.071 --> 02:35:14.571
through some of the- root

02:35:14.638 --> 02:35:15.973
causes that played identified

02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:16.607
some of are discussed and their

02:35:16.674 --> 02:35:17.775
proposed solutions. Their

02:35:17.841 --> 02:35:18.308
analysis of whether those

02:35:18.375 --> 02:35:20.044
solutions are addressed by the

02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:21.912
current regulation. And then at

02:35:21.979 --> 02:35:24.114
my individual analysis of

02:35:24.181 --> 02:35:25.983
whether I think that is indeed

02:35:26.050 --> 02:35:28.052
correct and whether the relic

02:35:28.118 --> 02:35:29.787
regulations do address those

02:35:29.853 --> 02:35:30.387
issues. So I wanna be clear

02:35:30.454 --> 02:35:32.156
that I'm I'm not calling into

02:35:32.222 --> 02:35:33.991
question any of the technical

02:35:34.058 --> 02:35:35.993
expertise of blade or any of

02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:37.761
their technical analysis. You

02:35:37.828 --> 02:35:41.865
know to the extent that my

02:35:41.932 --> 02:35:44.034
analysis of the adequacy of

02:35:44.101 --> 02:35:45.803
daughters rules. Differs from

02:35:45.869 --> 02:35:47.805
blades I believe that reflects

02:35:47.871 --> 02:35:48.305
more of a difference in

02:35:48.372 --> 02:35:49.807
expectations about tried

02:35:49.873 --> 02:35:52.009
transparency. What's necessary

02:35:52.076 --> 02:35:54.011
to turn the words printed in

02:35:54.078 --> 02:35:54.611
these regulations and actual

02:35:54.678 --> 02:35:57.781
results in the field. And

02:35:57.848 --> 02:35:58.382
possibly a difference and risk

02:35:58.449 --> 02:36:02.152
tolerance. So the first route

02:36:02.219 --> 02:36:04.221
because as we have all learned

02:36:04.288 --> 02:36:08.025
the- way that the well was

02:36:08.092 --> 02:36:08.492
designed completed and

02:36:08.559 --> 02:36:10.194
maintained led to corrosion on

02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:12.129
the backside of the casing the

02:36:12.196 --> 02:36:14.131
outside of the casing which

02:36:14.198 --> 02:36:14.765
eventually led to rupture and a

02:36:14.832 --> 02:36:17.801
leak. Blades proposed solution

02:36:17.868 --> 02:36:18.435
to this is that cement should

02:36:18.502 --> 02:36:20.304
be production casings should be

02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:21.905
submitted to service there

02:36:21.972 --> 02:36:23.941
should not be gaps behind. The

02:36:24.007 --> 02:36:26.076
production casing as they-

02:36:26.143 --> 02:36:28.145
discovered on this is not

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:30.080
currently required by doctors

02:36:30.147 --> 02:36:31.949
either does or existing or- new

02:36:32.015 --> 02:36:36.019
regulations the dog rule in the

02:36:36.086 --> 02:36:37.955
gas or just simply says the

02:36:38.021 --> 02:36:38.455
intermediate production

02:36:38.522 --> 02:36:40.290
casings. If they're not similar

02:36:40.357 --> 02:36:42.159
to surface have to be submitted

02:36:42.226 --> 02:36:43.994
in accordance with some

02:36:44.061 --> 02:36:44.561
existing requirements which

02:36:44.628 --> 02:36:46.130
also do not require some

02:36:46.196 --> 02:36:47.831
meaning to surface. Also this

02:36:47.898 --> 02:36:48.432
is an area that remains on a

02:36:48.499 --> 02:36:50.200
dress and in which action is

02:36:50.267 --> 02:36:52.136
needed. Doctors actually in the

02:36:52.202 --> 02:36:54.204
process of going through a wall

02:36:54.271 --> 02:36:55.973
construction rule making so

02:36:56.039 --> 02:36:57.841
long standing need to update

02:36:57.908 --> 02:36:58.475
their well construction rules.

02:36:58.542 --> 02:37:00.177
For all oil and gas wells so be

02:37:00.244 --> 02:37:01.979
one way that they could address

02:37:02.045 --> 02:37:04.081
that or they could go through a

02:37:04.148 --> 02:37:04.715
separate rule making to require

02:37:04.782 --> 02:37:06.250
this. But it's important to

02:37:06.316 --> 02:37:08.051
note the cementing to service

02:37:08.118 --> 02:37:09.987
can only be applied to new

02:37:10.053 --> 02:37:11.922
wells not to the hundreds of

02:37:11.989 --> 02:37:12.556
existing wells that are already

02:37:12.623 --> 02:37:15.859
being used for a gas storage.

02:37:15.926 --> 02:37:16.527
Given that you know gas storage

02:37:16.593 --> 02:37:18.228
is likely only to be occurring

02:37:18.295 --> 02:37:20.130
in the existing fields and not

02:37:20.197 --> 02:37:22.032
the new fields. This will not

02:37:22.099 --> 02:37:23.967
address the existing wells

02:37:24.034 --> 02:37:27.871
which- is obviously an issue

02:37:27.938 --> 02:37:28.338
that the rules do not

02:37:28.405 --> 02:37:29.873
specifically include

02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:30.407
requirements for what you

02:37:30.474 --> 02:37:32.209
should have to do to convert an

02:37:32.276 --> 02:37:34.077
existing well like the SS

02:37:34.144 --> 02:37:36.013
twenty five. That was not built

02:37:36.079 --> 02:37:41.885
for purpose to a gas storage.

02:37:41.952 --> 02:37:42.419
Well and we think that's a

02:37:42.486 --> 02:37:49.960
shortcoming of the rules. Art

02:37:50.027 --> 02:37:50.527
so. One of the other root

02:37:50.594 --> 02:37:51.929
causes that was identified by

02:37:51.995 --> 02:37:52.429
played was the lack of

02:37:52.496 --> 02:37:53.864
regulations. Requiring

02:37:53.931 --> 02:37:54.531
corrosion detection election of

02:37:54.598 --> 02:37:55.866
corrosion detection is.

02:37:55.933 --> 02:37:56.433
Employed by it so cal gas.

02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:58.202
Their solution recommend

02:37:58.268 --> 02:38:00.204
solution is that regulation

02:38:00.270 --> 02:38:01.872
should require wall thickness

02:38:01.939 --> 02:38:03.974
inspection. They concluded that

02:38:04.041 --> 02:38:06.243
this. Is indeed addressed by

02:38:06.310 --> 02:38:09.880
daughters latest regulations. I

02:38:09.947 --> 02:38:10.514
agree that is partly address

02:38:10.581 --> 02:38:12.282
but eight think that their

02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:14.051
rules could do more. Daughters

02:38:14.117 --> 02:38:15.886
rules require casing wall

02:38:15.953 --> 02:38:16.520
thickness thickness inspections

02:38:16.587 --> 02:38:19.890
at least once every two years.

02:38:19.957 --> 02:38:20.524
Those results that have to be

02:38:20.591 --> 02:38:22.059
compared to each other to

02:38:22.125 --> 02:38:23.894
determine a corrosion rate.

02:38:23.961 --> 02:38:24.428
Based on that determine

02:38:24.494 --> 02:38:26.129
corrosion rate they have to

02:38:26.196 --> 02:38:27.898
take action if it's a suspected

02:38:27.965 --> 02:38:29.900
that Lee could occur. But

02:38:29.967 --> 02:38:30.601
there's also a variance in this

02:38:30.667 --> 02:38:32.236
rule which says that last few

02:38:32.302 --> 02:38:33.904
frequent expects inspection

02:38:33.971 --> 02:38:36.139
could be approved. Based on the

02:38:36.206 --> 02:38:41.979
results of the test. At we

02:38:42.045 --> 02:38:45.916
think this is an adequate there

02:38:45.983 --> 02:38:47.918
is also a big detailed

02:38:47.985 --> 02:38:50.087
requirement in the risk

02:38:50.153 --> 02:38:52.155
management plan for them to

02:38:52.222 --> 02:38:55.926
develop a casing inspection.

02:38:55.993 --> 02:38:58.095
And corrosion plan we think

02:38:58.161 --> 02:39:05.936
those these. Two requirements

02:39:06.003 --> 02:39:08.105
need to be working together

02:39:08.171 --> 02:39:12.109
more explicitly. And also we

02:39:12.175 --> 02:39:14.011
don't think it's appropriate to

02:39:14.077 --> 02:39:16.146
allow variance in the testing

02:39:16.213 --> 02:39:18.215
you can't find problems that

02:39:18.282 --> 02:39:23.954
you're not looking for. In the.

02:39:24.021 --> 02:39:28.091
The management plan. It is

02:39:28.158 --> 02:39:28.625
indeed address by dockers

02:39:28.692 --> 02:39:31.929
regulations which requires a

02:39:31.995 --> 02:39:34.031
pretty significant development

02:39:34.097 --> 02:39:34.631
of a pretty significant risk

02:39:34.698 --> 02:39:36.266
management plan. But you know

02:39:36.333 --> 02:39:39.970
in addition to that obviously.

02:39:40.037 --> 02:39:42.072
You know. The well I'll say the

02:39:42.139 --> 02:39:42.639
risk manager regulations are

02:39:42.706 --> 02:39:44.474
pretty comprehensive they're

02:39:44.541 --> 02:39:46.276
technically sound. And they are

02:39:46.343 --> 02:39:48.111
largely performance based. Now

02:39:48.178 --> 02:39:50.147
performance based regulations

02:39:50.213 --> 02:39:52.249
can have advantages among those

02:39:52.316 --> 02:39:54.217
are that. They consider site

02:39:54.284 --> 02:39:56.086
specific conditions and risks I

02:39:56.153 --> 02:39:58.188
have the disadvantage of

02:39:58.255 --> 02:39:58.822
performance based requirements

02:39:58.889 --> 02:40:00.324
as aid by definition. Lack

02:40:00.390 --> 02:40:02.259
prescriptive standards and it

02:40:02.326 --> 02:40:04.261
can be there for difficult to

02:40:04.328 --> 02:40:04.795
objectively assess their

02:40:04.861 --> 02:40:08.131
adequacy. So say for example a

02:40:08.198 --> 02:40:09.967
prescriptive standard would say

02:40:10.033 --> 02:40:10.634
cement the production casing to

02:40:10.701 --> 02:40:12.502
surface it's very easy to

02:40:12.569 --> 02:40:14.271
determine. Whether production

02:40:14.338 --> 02:40:16.073
casing has or has not been

02:40:16.139 --> 02:40:18.175
submitted to surface. A

02:40:18.241 --> 02:40:18.742
performance based standard

02:40:18.809 --> 02:40:20.277
would say cement your

02:40:20.344 --> 02:40:22.546
production casing in such a way

02:40:22.612 --> 02:40:24.281
that prevents the movement of

02:40:24.348 --> 02:40:26.049
fluids behind the casing. It

02:40:26.116 --> 02:40:28.051
may achieve the same goal but

02:40:28.118 --> 02:40:28.552
it's more difficult to

02:40:28.618 --> 02:40:32.222
objectively analyze that that's

02:40:32.289 --> 02:40:32.789
not to say the performance

02:40:32.856 --> 02:40:34.257
based regulation should be use

02:40:34.324 --> 02:40:38.128
actually can be very important.

02:40:38.195 --> 02:40:40.364
But one way to help reduce some

02:40:40.430 --> 02:40:46.103
of the ambiguity is to develop

02:40:46.169 --> 02:40:50.007
detailed guidance which sets

02:40:50.073 --> 02:40:54.144
very clear expectations for the

02:40:54.211 --> 02:40:56.313
elements that should be

02:40:56.380 --> 02:40:58.515
included in the risk management

02:40:58.582 --> 02:41:02.319
plan. I think that's something

02:41:02.386 --> 02:41:06.223
darker should do. Also think

02:41:06.289 --> 02:41:13.997
it's critical. Stop the leak

02:41:14.064 --> 02:41:16.033
they either didn't possessor

02:41:16.099 --> 02:41:16.566
didn't apply the knowledge

02:41:16.633 --> 02:41:20.237
necessary to stop the leak when

02:41:20.303 --> 02:41:20.837
it could have been. So even

02:41:20.904 --> 02:41:22.472
expert sometimes don't have all

02:41:22.539 --> 02:41:24.374
of the answers getting more

02:41:24.441 --> 02:41:26.276
input from other experts and I

02:41:26.343 --> 02:41:32.282
would be important step. Here

02:41:32.349 --> 02:41:36.219
again casing corrosion was a

02:41:36.286 --> 02:41:38.388
big part of the root cause of

02:41:38.455 --> 02:41:42.225
the leak. And blade found that

02:41:42.292 --> 02:41:44.127
you know they were really

02:41:44.194 --> 02:41:44.728
addressing those problems re

02:41:44.795 --> 02:41:46.530
actively they weren't being

02:41:46.596 --> 02:41:47.130
proactive as the recommended

02:41:47.197 --> 02:41:48.498
solution was to conduct a

02:41:48.565 --> 02:41:52.135
casing corrosion study they

02:41:52.202 --> 02:41:54.137
determined that the regulations

02:41:54.204 --> 02:41:54.671
do indeed address this. I

02:41:54.738 --> 02:41:56.540
concur with their finding the

02:41:56.606 --> 02:41:58.608
risk management plan includes

02:41:58.675 --> 02:42:00.143
pretty comprehensive

02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:02.145
requirements to develop a

02:42:02.212 --> 02:42:04.147
corrosion monitoring evaluation

02:42:04.214 --> 02:42:06.216
and mitigation standard. But

02:42:06.283 --> 02:42:08.251
again I would say that that

02:42:08.318 --> 02:42:10.454
also needs to have a public

02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:12.155
notice and comment process

02:42:12.222 --> 02:42:12.689
associated with it public

02:42:12.756 --> 02:42:14.224
should have an opportunity to

02:42:14.291 --> 02:42:16.226
weigh in on the development of

02:42:16.293 --> 02:42:18.161
those plans. And again doctor

02:42:18.228 --> 02:42:18.695
should issue guidance for

02:42:18.762 --> 02:42:19.296
anything that's a performance

02:42:19.362 --> 02:42:20.797
based regulation they need to

02:42:20.864 --> 02:42:24.167
provide some more road markers

02:42:24.234 --> 02:42:26.269
so that other people can more

02:42:26.336 --> 02:42:30.407
objectively. Assess whether

02:42:30.474 --> 02:42:34.177
those regulations are being met.

02:42:34.244 --> 02:42:36.580
See so the- they also found

02:42:36.646 --> 02:42:38.448
that failure analysis had not

02:42:38.515 --> 02:42:42.486
been provided or had not been

02:42:42.552 --> 02:42:44.354
conducted proactively us again

02:42:44.421 --> 02:42:46.356
blade solution was that they

02:42:46.423 --> 02:42:48.158
should be conducting a casing

02:42:48.225 --> 02:42:50.427
failure analysis their analysis

02:42:50.494 --> 02:42:52.162
was that is not specifically

02:42:52.229 --> 02:42:54.297
addressed by regulation but it

02:42:54.364 --> 02:42:54.931
would be expected to be a part

02:42:54.998 --> 02:42:58.235
of the risk management plan and

02:42:58.301 --> 02:42:58.902
I think you know I concur with

02:42:58.969 --> 02:43:00.470
that but I think a solution

02:43:00.537 --> 02:43:02.305
pretty obviously is to just

02:43:02.372 --> 02:43:02.973
make that explicit there should

02:43:03.039 --> 02:43:04.708
be no question that that should

02:43:04.774 --> 02:43:05.308
be a part of the regulations

02:43:05.375 --> 02:43:08.178
that could potentially. Be

02:43:08.245 --> 02:43:08.778
accomplish their guidance or

02:43:08.845 --> 02:43:10.480
through a new rule making and

02:43:10.547 --> 02:43:12.282
again as with the others there

02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:14.451
should be a public input

02:43:14.518 --> 02:43:20.423
process into all of these. The

02:43:20.490 --> 02:43:22.592
sea so again another route

02:43:22.659 --> 02:43:26.263
because- that played at

02:43:26.329 --> 02:43:30.400
identified was the- the lack of

02:43:30.467 --> 02:43:32.202
well specific detail well

02:43:32.269 --> 02:43:34.204
controlled plans. Which

02:43:34.271 --> 02:43:36.306
extended the time that it took

02:43:36.373 --> 02:43:38.308
to do the well kill. Their

02:43:38.375 --> 02:43:40.210
solution of course obviously is

02:43:40.277 --> 02:43:42.279
to include weld specific and

02:43:42.345 --> 02:43:44.214
detailed well control plans and

02:43:44.281 --> 02:43:44.881
their assessment was it that it

02:43:44.948 --> 02:43:48.285
is addressed by regulations. My

02:43:48.351 --> 02:43:50.287
assessment is that it

02:43:50.353 --> 02:43:50.921
potentially could be included

02:43:50.987 --> 02:43:52.622
in the emergency response plan

02:43:52.689 --> 02:43:54.457
requirements but I don't think

02:43:54.524 --> 02:43:56.593
it's- necessarily explicit. So

02:43:56.660 --> 02:43:58.662
I think that would be another

02:43:58.728 --> 02:44:00.230
at potential improvement is

02:44:00.297 --> 02:44:00.897
that this should be explicitly

02:44:00.964 --> 02:44:02.566
required. Again that should

02:44:02.632 --> 02:44:04.301
also be subject to public

02:44:04.367 --> 02:44:06.670
comment and notice and I have

02:44:06.736 --> 02:44:12.375
guidance developed. They also.

02:44:12.442 --> 02:44:13.009
Identified as one of the root

02:44:13.076 --> 02:44:14.578
causes obviously they'll the

02:44:14.644 --> 02:44:16.680
single use of a single barrier

02:44:16.746 --> 02:44:18.515
the recommended solution is to

02:44:18.582 --> 02:44:20.417
use a tubing and Packer

02:44:20.483 --> 02:44:22.385
completion do barrier system

02:44:22.452 --> 02:44:23.019
this is a critical one because

02:44:23.086 --> 02:44:24.487
I actually think there's been a

02:44:24.554 --> 02:44:25.055
little bit of misinformation

02:44:25.121 --> 02:44:26.623
today about whether this is

02:44:26.690 --> 02:44:28.491
actually required. Laid

02:44:28.558 --> 02:44:29.092
analysis is that yes this is

02:44:29.159 --> 02:44:32.462
required. Duggars rules do not

02:44:32.529 --> 02:44:33.063
explicitly require the use of

02:44:33.129 --> 02:44:36.399
tubing they require that wells

02:44:36.466 --> 02:44:37.033
are construction will both a

02:44:37.100 --> 02:44:38.501
primary and secondary

02:44:38.568 --> 02:44:40.303
mechanical well barriers but

02:44:40.370 --> 02:44:40.971
they do not explicitly required

02:44:41.037 --> 02:44:42.706
to being set on a Packer. In

02:44:42.772 --> 02:44:44.641
this is confirmed by the fact

02:44:44.708 --> 02:44:46.476
that in numerous other places

02:44:46.543 --> 02:44:48.245
throughout the well it's as if

02:44:48.311 --> 02:44:50.313
to being is use. Now having the

02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:50.914
requirement for having both

02:44:50.981 --> 02:44:52.682
primary and secondary well

02:44:52.749 --> 02:44:54.484
barriers is very important

02:44:54.551 --> 02:44:56.519
again it's a little bit more of

02:44:56.586 --> 02:45:02.392
a performance based goals. But

02:45:02.459 --> 02:45:03.026
I think it should be expressly

02:45:03.093 --> 02:45:03.660
required to inject her to be on

02:45:03.727 --> 02:45:04.661
a Packer and the reason is

02:45:04.728 --> 02:45:06.596
that. To being can readily be

02:45:06.663 --> 02:45:08.698
replaced and removed from the

02:45:08.765 --> 02:45:10.400
well it's not permanently

02:45:10.467 --> 02:45:11.034
affixed in the well. If you're

02:45:11.101 --> 02:45:14.404
using casings cemented casing

02:45:14.471 --> 02:45:16.473
that's much more difficult to

02:45:16.539 --> 02:45:18.475
remove and patching casing

02:45:18.541 --> 02:45:20.343
repairing casing is not always

02:45:20.410 --> 02:45:20.944
as successful so I would say

02:45:21.011 --> 02:45:22.712
that. Explicitly requiring

02:45:22.779 --> 02:45:24.681
injection and withdrawal to

02:45:24.748 --> 02:45:26.483
occur only thru tubing sat on a

02:45:26.549 --> 02:45:28.685
Packer. Should be part of

02:45:28.752 --> 02:45:34.658
requirements. I and finally I

02:45:34.724 --> 02:45:35.292
just wanna know that obviously

02:45:35.358 --> 02:45:36.526
this is only one of many gas

02:45:36.593 --> 02:45:38.361
storage fields in California.

02:45:38.428 --> 02:45:40.563
Many of which were discovered

02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:42.565
and began operating around the

02:45:42.632 --> 02:45:44.601
same time as a lease canyon.

02:45:44.668 --> 02:45:46.436
These all present risks these

02:45:46.503 --> 02:45:48.405
all need to be brought up to

02:45:48.471 --> 02:45:50.440
the modern standards that have

02:45:50.507 --> 02:45:52.676
been adopted. Part of the rules

02:45:52.742 --> 02:45:54.444
require that the risk

02:45:54.511 --> 02:45:56.346
management plans and emergency

02:45:56.413 --> 02:45:58.348
response plans we made public.

02:45:58.415 --> 02:45:58.982
I'm not aware that those have

02:45:59.049 --> 02:46:00.550
been made public yet but you

02:46:00.617 --> 02:46:02.719
know I think I know update from

02:46:02.786 --> 02:46:04.521
dog or on the status of where

02:46:04.587 --> 02:46:05.188
it stands to bring all of these

02:46:05.255 --> 02:46:08.358
fields into compliance. With

02:46:08.425 --> 02:46:08.992
the new regulations that would

02:46:09.059 --> 02:46:10.560
be very useful. And so I'll

02:46:10.627 --> 02:46:14.397
leave it there. Thank you.

02:46:14.464 --> 02:46:15.031
Thank you miss more Dick doctor

02:46:15.098 --> 02:46:22.672
less you. NASA have some slides

02:46:22.739 --> 02:46:23.239
here if you can get those up

02:46:23.306 --> 02:46:26.710
for us. So we're gonna sort of

02:46:26.776 --> 02:46:27.344
change gears a little bit we've

02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:28.645
been talking not to diminish

02:46:28.712 --> 02:46:30.480
the root the root cause

02:46:30.547 --> 02:46:31.047
analysis but Richler shortly

02:46:31.114 --> 02:46:32.782
before that came out there was

02:46:32.849 --> 02:46:34.818
another report that came out

02:46:34.884 --> 02:46:35.418
and posted on doctors website

02:46:35.485 --> 02:46:36.753
which is the draft seismic

02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:38.555
hazard analysis and I wanted

02:46:38.621 --> 02:46:40.623
to. To discuss that in order to

02:46:40.690 --> 02:46:41.257
make sure we have a little bit

02:46:41.324 --> 02:46:42.726
of context I wanted to remind

02:46:42.792 --> 02:46:45.028
us where we are here we are of

02:46:45.095 --> 02:46:46.629
course in. The southern

02:46:46.696 --> 02:46:48.665
California where we've got

02:46:48.732 --> 02:46:49.232
these two plates crashing

02:46:49.299 --> 02:46:50.800
together and the hills that are

02:46:50.867 --> 02:46:52.836
behind Porter ranch for the so

02:46:52.902 --> 02:46:54.571
caring is located they are

02:46:54.637 --> 02:46:56.673
being pushed off constantly and

02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:58.641
thing crust up along the

02:46:58.708 --> 02:47:00.477
sentences in a false system and

02:47:00.543 --> 02:47:02.479
that runs along the base of.

02:47:02.545 --> 02:47:04.647
These mountains so we know that

02:47:04.714 --> 02:47:06.549
this false system exists

02:47:06.616 --> 02:47:08.418
because of course when we slice

02:47:08.485 --> 02:47:09.018
through the earth. I do that

02:47:09.085 --> 02:47:12.555
here. All of the wells Italy so

02:47:12.622 --> 02:47:14.691
canyon actually cut through

02:47:14.758 --> 02:47:15.358
that and we have well log that

02:47:15.425 --> 02:47:16.960
show us where those where those

02:47:17.026 --> 02:47:20.630
faults are crossing through the

02:47:20.697 --> 02:47:22.899
wells so we know that this is a

02:47:22.966 --> 02:47:24.734
this is an issue. CGS the

02:47:24.801 --> 02:47:26.770
crates maps of different types

02:47:26.836 --> 02:47:28.505
of hazards the minister's skip

02:47:28.571 --> 02:47:29.105
over this but to show to show

02:47:29.172 --> 02:47:30.940
you this is a picture of the

02:47:31.007 --> 02:47:32.609
relevant area with those

02:47:32.675 --> 02:47:33.143
different colors showing

02:47:33.209 --> 02:47:34.577
different types of hazards. And

02:47:34.644 --> 02:47:36.746
you course see that there are

02:47:36.813 --> 02:47:38.615
colors everywhere the yellow

02:47:38.681 --> 02:47:40.750
area there is the fault rupture

02:47:40.817 --> 02:47:42.619
hazard which means that if you

02:47:42.685 --> 02:47:43.119
were to try to build a

02:47:43.186 --> 02:47:44.921
development or a hospital or a

02:47:44.988 --> 02:47:46.856
school in there because this is

02:47:46.923 --> 02:47:50.693
an area where to size the fault

02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:54.431
might slip. And might rip apart

02:47:54.497 --> 02:47:54.931
your structure you would

02:47:54.998 --> 02:47:56.866
actually have to do special

02:47:56.933 --> 02:47:58.835
studies to do that we currently

02:47:58.902 --> 02:48:02.605
have no such regulations for

02:48:02.672 --> 02:48:04.607
one S. A. structure crosses a

02:48:04.674 --> 02:48:08.711
fault in the subsurface is only

02:48:08.778 --> 02:48:12.549
about the service and in fact

02:48:12.615 --> 02:48:14.717
this yellow area here. Is where

02:48:14.784 --> 02:48:16.886
the nineteen seventy one San

02:48:16.953 --> 02:48:18.721
Fernando earthquake ruptured

02:48:18.788 --> 02:48:20.590
also we know that that area is

02:48:20.657 --> 02:48:22.592
in fact well mapped because

02:48:22.659 --> 02:48:24.527
that's where the fault is. And

02:48:24.594 --> 02:48:26.863
the only reason that there's no

02:48:26.930 --> 02:48:28.565
mapping over here on the left

02:48:28.631 --> 02:48:32.569
side is because nobody lived

02:48:32.635 --> 02:48:36.573
there and it didn't seem to be

02:48:36.639 --> 02:48:38.775
relevant or important for us to

02:48:38.842 --> 02:48:42.645
map in that particular area at

02:48:42.712 --> 02:48:48.685
the time but of course. Well

02:48:48.751 --> 02:48:50.753
the collapsed in the nineteen

02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:51.354
ninety four earthquake that so

02:48:51.421 --> 02:48:52.822
cal gas documented in the risk

02:48:52.889 --> 02:48:54.824
management plan I don't know

02:48:54.891 --> 02:48:55.391
any details about it they

02:48:55.458 --> 02:48:56.693
didn't provide any of the of

02:48:56.759 --> 02:48:57.260
what at details about what

02:48:57.327 --> 02:48:58.895
happened. Clearly not a major

02:48:58.962 --> 02:49:00.964
calamity or we would have heard

02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:02.832
about it but these there are

02:49:02.899 --> 02:49:03.399
some hazards associated with

02:49:03.466 --> 02:49:06.669
earthquakes in this field. How

02:49:06.736 --> 02:49:08.805
big earthquake are briefly I

02:49:08.872 --> 02:49:11.107
just the expected magnitude as

02:49:11.174 --> 02:49:13.076
a progeny magnitude seven point

02:49:13.142 --> 02:49:14.844
three which- is about eight

02:49:14.911 --> 02:49:16.713
times the energy release of the

02:49:16.779 --> 02:49:17.247
nineteen ninety four. For

02:49:17.313 --> 02:49:18.781
Northridge earthquake so a very

02:49:18.848 --> 02:49:19.382
large earthquake could happen

02:49:19.449 --> 02:49:22.585
here. With that in mind so cal

02:49:22.652 --> 02:49:24.721
gas was mandated to. Produce a

02:49:24.787 --> 02:49:25.221
seismic report by some

02:49:25.288 --> 02:49:26.890
independent now. Independent

02:49:26.956 --> 02:49:30.727
agencies. And they did a very

02:49:30.793 --> 02:49:32.595
detailed study actually want it

02:49:32.662 --> 02:49:33.162
when I commend them for the

02:49:33.229 --> 02:49:34.764
study it's and are there not

02:49:34.831 --> 02:49:35.365
there the study's authors not

02:49:35.431 --> 02:49:36.866
here like blade was to for us

02:49:36.933 --> 02:49:38.668
to thank us for doing an ice

02:49:38.735 --> 02:49:40.904
independent job. But they went

02:49:40.970 --> 02:49:41.504
through step by step they

02:49:41.571 --> 02:49:42.906
looked at where the faults. How

02:49:42.972 --> 02:49:44.908
big the earthquakes be on those

02:49:44.974 --> 02:49:46.676
faults if we have an earthquake

02:49:46.743 --> 02:49:47.343
on not fault what's it going to

02:49:47.410 --> 02:49:49.145
do to the to the- to the wells.

02:49:49.212 --> 02:49:51.147
If they start leaking. How much

02:49:51.214 --> 02:49:53.049
could they leak and once that

02:49:53.116 --> 02:49:54.951
gas leaks out into the rock.

02:49:55.018 --> 02:49:56.953
How much is going to reach the

02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:58.621
service they did step by step

02:49:58.688 --> 02:49:59.088
they have a thick ten

02:49:59.155 --> 02:50:00.990
different. Parts to this report

02:50:01.057 --> 02:50:02.926
to each one's a couple hundred

02:50:02.992 --> 02:50:04.827
pages the work of several

02:50:04.894 --> 02:50:06.763
scientists for a couple months

02:50:06.829 --> 02:50:07.196
probably. This is

02:50:07.263 --> 02:50:08.831
comprehensive. On briefly to

02:50:08.898 --> 02:50:10.934
show you the short answer the

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.936
conclusions. Faults I already

02:50:13.002 --> 02:50:14.771
told you that all the- faults

02:50:14.837 --> 02:50:15.305
are cut by all the all the

02:50:15.371 --> 02:50:18.641
wells are cut by active fault.

02:50:18.708 --> 02:50:19.175
We also know two expected

02:50:19.242 --> 02:50:20.944
earthquakes neither of those

02:50:21.010 --> 02:50:22.879
things were new. On the well if

02:50:22.946 --> 02:50:24.981
you build a well across a fault

02:50:25.048 --> 02:50:26.816
and it moves several feet. You

02:50:26.883 --> 02:50:28.651
should expected to rip apart.

02:50:28.718 --> 02:50:32.956
That's. Also perhaps not

02:50:33.022 --> 02:50:33.523
landmark it'll show you some

02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:38.695
pictures in a moment. Some of

02:50:38.761 --> 02:50:39.295
the gas that breaks out will

02:50:39.362 --> 02:50:39.796
actually remain trapped

02:50:39.862 --> 02:50:40.396
underground and they did some

02:50:40.463 --> 02:50:40.997
detailed modeling it'll tell

02:50:41.064 --> 02:50:41.564
you about. And in the worst

02:50:41.631 --> 02:50:43.066
case this was done when there

02:50:43.132 --> 02:50:43.733
were sixty two active well save

02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:45.101
since brought a few more online

02:50:45.168 --> 02:50:46.636
we heard about that I guess are

02:50:46.703 --> 02:50:47.236
to sixty six or something. So

02:50:47.303 --> 02:50:48.705
I'm I'm stuck in the past of

02:50:48.771 --> 02:50:49.339
met early may for this but at

02:50:49.405 --> 02:50:51.107
the time they were at

02:50:51.174 --> 02:50:52.942
estimating sixty two wells.

02:50:53.009 --> 02:50:56.846
Leaking simultaneously. So

02:50:56.913 --> 02:50:57.413
let's look at some of those

02:50:57.480 --> 02:50:58.948
things in more detail. Re flee

02:50:59.015 --> 02:51:00.950
they they had parts this report

02:51:01.017 --> 02:51:01.584
the covered all these different

02:51:01.651 --> 02:51:02.752
types of hazards. I'm gonna

02:51:02.819 --> 02:51:03.353
focus on fault rupture because

02:51:03.419 --> 02:51:05.021
that's the one that actually

02:51:05.088 --> 02:51:06.856
makes a difference. For us. For

02:51:06.923 --> 02:51:08.925
ground shaking they sort of

02:51:08.992 --> 02:51:10.760
shows seven wells might leak

02:51:10.827 --> 02:51:11.327
and a and a pretty strong

02:51:11.394 --> 02:51:12.962
earthquake so that's not a-

02:51:13.029 --> 02:51:15.131
huge concern compared to fault

02:51:15.198 --> 02:51:17.133
rupture. Landslides a very

02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:18.768
detailed report but it ends

02:51:18.835 --> 02:51:19.335
with this vague conclusion

02:51:19.402 --> 02:51:20.970
that. Only a few wells. Are

02:51:21.037 --> 02:51:22.772
very on unscientific. And

02:51:22.839 --> 02:51:24.974
liquefaction not relevant for

02:51:25.041 --> 02:51:26.809
this area there's and there's

02:51:26.876 --> 02:51:27.410
no hazard from that so. We're

02:51:27.477 --> 02:51:28.845
gonna focus in on fault

02:51:28.911 --> 02:51:30.980
rupture. And we do talk about

02:51:31.047 --> 02:51:31.581
here I've got I've got my old

02:51:31.648 --> 02:51:36.719
visual aid here. So imagine.

02:51:36.786 --> 02:51:37.320
You have things are connected.

02:51:37.387 --> 02:51:38.921
And they're going to move. Well

02:51:38.988 --> 02:51:40.990
how much do they move and

02:51:41.057 --> 02:51:41.557
that's the first thing they

02:51:41.624 --> 02:51:42.091
wanted to figure out and-

02:51:42.158 --> 02:51:42.725
they've got here probabilities.

02:51:42.792 --> 02:51:44.694
There's about a 10% chance.

02:51:44.761 --> 02:51:46.763
That the fall will moved. Six

02:51:46.829 --> 02:51:47.363
inches. Doesn't sound like a

02:51:47.430 --> 02:51:48.931
lot I remember looking at a

02:51:48.998 --> 02:51:50.933
seven inch diameter pipes to

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:51.501
six inches is getting to be

02:51:51.567 --> 02:51:53.069
substantial. That's a 10%

02:51:53.136 --> 02:51:56.906
chance next fifty years. It

02:51:56.973 --> 02:51:57.473
could be larger. I had my

02:51:57.540 --> 02:51:59.142
button there's a 5% chance that

02:51:59.208 --> 02:52:01.010
it could be about two and a

02:52:01.077 --> 02:52:01.678
half feet and this is a picture

02:52:01.744 --> 02:52:03.046
from the recent ridgecrest

02:52:03.112 --> 02:52:03.646
earthquake I think this is a

02:52:03.713 --> 02:52:05.048
little bit more than two and a

02:52:05.114 --> 02:52:07.083
half feet here but- imagine

02:52:07.150 --> 02:52:08.951
your little seven inch. Well

02:52:09.018 --> 02:52:11.187
being offset by that. And then

02:52:11.254 --> 02:52:14.791
lastly. There's a 2% chance

02:52:14.857 --> 02:52:15.391
that it could be as large as

02:52:15.458 --> 02:52:16.693
eight feet this is a classic

02:52:16.759 --> 02:52:17.293
picture from the nineteen oh

02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:19.128
six earthquake. Of offense the

02:52:19.195 --> 02:52:20.997
got offset by say about eight

02:52:21.064 --> 02:52:21.597
feet and you can imagine that

02:52:21.664 --> 02:52:23.099
instead of being a fence being

02:52:23.166 --> 02:52:24.767
a pipeline carrying gas. It

02:52:24.834 --> 02:52:26.869
comes to A. abrupt and

02:52:26.936 --> 02:52:27.437
somewhere in the middle and

02:52:27.503 --> 02:52:30.840
that gas is going to leak out.

02:52:30.907 --> 02:52:31.474
We've already talked about the

02:52:31.541 --> 02:52:33.109
straw within a straw you've

02:52:33.176 --> 02:52:34.911
seen pictures like this. This

02:52:34.977 --> 02:52:36.713
is the two layers of protection

02:52:36.779 --> 02:52:37.313
here's a picture of what those

02:52:37.380 --> 02:52:37.980
pipes actually look like when

02:52:38.047 --> 02:52:39.148
they're at the surface. So we

02:52:39.215 --> 02:52:41.184
do have those two layers of

02:52:41.250 --> 02:52:42.952
containment. But to there's a

02:52:43.019 --> 02:52:44.721
containment don't do you any

02:52:44.787 --> 02:52:45.321
good if both of those lawyers

02:52:45.388 --> 02:52:48.891
are ripped apart. And this is

02:52:48.958 --> 02:52:49.392
pictures from what they

02:52:49.459 --> 02:52:50.827
actually they actually took.

02:52:50.893 --> 02:52:53.096
Models of those pipes and took

02:52:53.162 --> 02:52:54.831
them into a laboratory and-

02:52:54.897 --> 02:52:56.833
expose them to sample

02:52:56.899 --> 02:52:57.433
earthquakes. And look to see

02:52:57.500 --> 02:52:59.102
what happened. And the- outer

02:52:59.168 --> 02:53:01.204
casing broken every time that

02:53:01.270 --> 02:53:01.704
they did this it's very

02:53:01.771 --> 02:53:03.239
brittle. On a visit to being a

02:53:03.306 --> 02:53:06.809
little bit more flexible. And

02:53:06.876 --> 02:53:08.945
it. Bent sometimes like you see

02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:10.947
here. Broke other times. But in

02:53:11.013 --> 02:53:13.082
sixteen of the eighteen cases

02:53:13.149 --> 02:53:14.884
including ones were bad. It

02:53:14.951 --> 02:53:16.819
sprung leaks in it. Releasing

02:53:16.886 --> 02:53:18.821
gas into their so basically

02:53:18.888 --> 02:53:23.226
both layers. Of protection were

02:53:23.292 --> 02:53:26.996
were were compromised. At this

02:53:27.063 --> 02:53:27.597
point I want to highlight to

02:53:27.663 --> 02:53:28.998
you a- how important it is to

02:53:29.065 --> 02:53:29.632
an independent analysis. So cal

02:53:29.699 --> 02:53:30.833
gas submitted the risk

02:53:30.900 --> 02:53:31.434
management plan two thousand

02:53:31.501 --> 02:53:33.069
seventeen and they gave us this

02:53:33.136 --> 02:53:35.138
quote that. It doesn't normally

02:53:35.204 --> 02:53:37.273
week. When you have this sort

02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:39.142
of offset and they offered us

02:53:39.208 --> 02:53:40.977
no evidence of that but of

02:53:41.043 --> 02:53:41.577
course when they actually had

02:53:41.644 --> 02:53:43.079
these independent labs go in

02:53:43.146 --> 02:53:45.014
and test this out. It to be

02:53:45.081 --> 02:53:45.615
leaked in sixteen of eighteen

02:53:45.681 --> 02:53:47.250
cases I think we can conclude

02:53:47.316 --> 02:53:49.252
that normally it actually does

02:53:49.318 --> 02:53:52.922
leak by varying amounts. So

02:53:52.989 --> 02:53:55.158
just briefly how to help they

02:53:55.224 --> 02:53:56.959
actually do some calculations

02:53:57.026 --> 02:53:58.861
here. When we have six inches

02:53:58.928 --> 02:54:00.963
of slip that 10% chance earth

02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:02.932
quake will get about 40% of our

02:54:02.999 --> 02:54:03.533
sorry forty of the sixty two

02:54:03.599 --> 02:54:06.969
wells with a failed. Forty

02:54:07.036 --> 02:54:07.603
eight of them would where would

02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:08.137
fail if we had a bigger

02:54:08.204 --> 02:54:10.873
earthquake and if you get this

02:54:10.940 --> 02:54:11.474
monster earthquake. All sixty

02:54:11.541 --> 02:54:12.942
two the wells will fail. So

02:54:13.009 --> 02:54:17.013
what happens that arm. This is

02:54:17.079 --> 02:54:17.613
all happening miles down is

02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:19.282
kind of a slice through the

02:54:19.348 --> 02:54:21.117
earth that shows you fifteen

02:54:21.184 --> 02:54:22.885
statues of liberty tall here

02:54:22.952 --> 02:54:23.486
and all these rocks the good

02:54:23.553 --> 02:54:25.188
news is that these rocks have

02:54:25.254 --> 02:54:26.956
successfully kept oil and gas

02:54:27.023 --> 02:54:28.925
traps for millions of years so

02:54:28.991 --> 02:54:29.559
it's not a foregone conclusion

02:54:29.625 --> 02:54:31.360
that the gas will go up to the

02:54:31.427 --> 02:54:32.862
surface there are a couple

02:54:32.929 --> 02:54:33.462
different pathways that it

02:54:33.529 --> 02:54:34.997
could get up there by. One is

02:54:35.064 --> 02:54:38.868
along the outside of the casing

02:54:38.935 --> 02:54:39.502
especially if it's not cemented

02:54:39.569 --> 02:54:41.304
it or if it's poorly cemented

02:54:41.370 --> 02:54:42.872
that's a pathway you can have

02:54:42.939 --> 02:54:44.874
and then along the fault itself

02:54:44.941 --> 02:54:47.310
and the authors of the study

02:54:47.376 --> 02:54:49.245
did a very good job and looked

02:54:49.312 --> 02:54:51.047
at these two paths possible

02:54:51.113 --> 02:54:52.882
pathways are they did. A

02:54:52.949 --> 02:54:53.549
simulation where they looked at

02:54:53.616 --> 02:54:55.184
thousands of an actually

02:54:55.251 --> 02:54:55.718
hundreds of thousands of

02:54:55.785 --> 02:54:57.253
different possible assumptions

02:54:57.320 --> 02:54:59.322
is the rock this easy to flow

02:54:59.388 --> 02:55:01.324
through or is it this easy to

02:55:01.390 --> 02:55:02.892
flow through and I tried all

02:55:02.959 --> 02:55:03.526
sorts of combinations is there

02:55:03.593 --> 02:55:05.127
and hundreds of thousands of

02:55:05.194 --> 02:55:07.063
them and they found that. In

02:55:07.129 --> 02:55:09.432
many cases there's no gas for

02:55:09.498 --> 02:55:11.200
the service but of course the

02:55:11.267 --> 02:55:13.336
beauty of this isn't science is

02:55:13.402 --> 02:55:15.204
that they can quantify the

02:55:15.271 --> 02:55:18.908
uncertainty they can tell us

02:55:18.975 --> 02:55:21.177
how many of the cases and so

02:55:21.244 --> 02:55:27.049
here are the results if we had

02:55:27.116 --> 02:55:31.187
just one well fail this is the

02:55:31.254 --> 02:55:31.821
first thing that they looked at

02:55:31.888 --> 02:55:33.155
and one of the reports. The

02:55:33.222 --> 02:55:34.924
middle of the road case had.

02:55:34.991 --> 02:55:35.491
Point oh one the point one

02:55:35.558 --> 02:55:37.193
million cubic feet per day of

02:55:37.260 --> 02:55:37.827
leakage which compared to the

02:55:37.894 --> 02:55:39.462
SS twenty five blow out. Which

02:55:39.528 --> 02:55:40.997
I didn't have the root cause

02:55:41.063 --> 02:55:41.631
analysis at the time of year I

02:55:41.697 --> 02:55:42.164
gave you I got the number

02:55:42.231 --> 02:55:42.798
should be ninety three here at

02:55:42.865 --> 02:55:43.399
peak but we had about eighty

02:55:43.466 --> 02:55:44.901
was the estimate before that.

02:55:44.967 --> 02:55:45.501
So this is this is relatively

02:55:45.568 --> 02:55:49.038
tiny not as much of a concern.

02:55:49.105 --> 02:55:49.672
But if I were to tell you that

02:55:49.739 --> 02:55:50.206
there's a 50% chance in an

02:55:50.273 --> 02:55:50.840
earthquake that you're gonna be

02:55:50.907 --> 02:55:51.440
fine. You want to know about

02:55:51.507 --> 02:55:53.276
the other 50% and happily the

02:55:53.342 --> 02:55:53.943
study's authors have quantified

02:55:54.010 --> 02:55:55.211
this for us they tell us that

02:55:55.278 --> 02:55:57.213
in. 10% of the cases. The flow

02:55:57.280 --> 02:55:59.115
rate is worse than. Ten million

02:55:59.181 --> 02:56:01.083
cubic feet per day. Which is

02:56:01.150 --> 02:56:03.052
again smaller than SS twenty

02:56:03.119 --> 02:56:05.221
five. But the slide I will warn

02:56:05.288 --> 02:56:05.821
you is basically irrelevant

02:56:05.888 --> 02:56:07.290
because we're not expecting a

02:56:07.356 --> 02:56:09.125
single thought to fail. Or

02:56:09.191 --> 02:56:09.759
sorry singled out to fail we're

02:56:09.825 --> 02:56:11.227
expecting. All sixty two of

02:56:11.294 --> 02:56:13.496
them and when that happens. The

02:56:13.562 --> 02:56:15.197
study authors did a good job

02:56:15.264 --> 02:56:16.999
again they ran a simulation of.

02:56:17.066 --> 02:56:19.135
All sixty two wells failing it.

02:56:19.201 --> 02:56:21.037
And that middle of the road

02:56:21.103 --> 02:56:22.939
case again. Is not. Hugely

02:56:23.005 --> 02:56:25.174
concerning. It's much smaller

02:56:25.241 --> 02:56:27.376
than the SS twenty five

02:56:27.443 --> 02:56:29.278
blowout. But we do have the

02:56:29.345 --> 02:56:31.180
situation where 10% of the

02:56:31.247 --> 02:56:33.149
cases that they ran. Have

02:56:33.215 --> 02:56:35.117
something that is something

02:56:35.184 --> 02:56:37.153
like if I had my by near about

02:56:37.219 --> 02:56:39.121
three times the flow rate. From

02:56:39.188 --> 02:56:39.755
the SS twenty five blowout. And

02:56:39.822 --> 02:56:41.324
cumulatively. Eight times more

02:56:41.390 --> 02:56:43.426
emissions of methane over there

02:56:43.492 --> 02:56:45.528
the lifetime of five years they

02:56:45.594 --> 02:56:49.165
ran their simulation so this

02:56:49.231 --> 02:56:53.202
could be. Quite a bit larger. I

02:56:53.269 --> 02:56:53.769
also want to point out that

02:56:53.836 --> 02:56:55.104
something that's important for

02:56:55.171 --> 02:56:55.638
us that our effort if our

02:56:55.705 --> 02:56:56.238
doctor friends are still here

02:56:56.305 --> 02:56:57.406
in terms of the future of

02:56:57.473 --> 02:56:59.041
things. On their draft report

02:56:59.108 --> 02:56:59.642
had had a flaw in it that I

02:56:59.709 --> 02:57:01.477
wanted to point out and I and I

02:57:01.544 --> 02:57:03.379
did to doctor. That they use

02:57:03.446 --> 02:57:05.181
all of the measurements of the

02:57:05.247 --> 02:57:07.583
rock. Here that we're all from

02:57:07.650 --> 02:57:11.053
before the earthquake. And how

02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:11.620
easy is it for gas to flow

02:57:11.687 --> 02:57:13.222
through there. With our

02:57:13.289 --> 02:57:15.391
measurements right now. But we

02:57:15.458 --> 02:57:15.958
know that in an earthquake

02:57:16.025 --> 02:57:17.526
yeah. Earthquakes loosen up old

02:57:17.593 --> 02:57:19.295
fractures create new ones. And

02:57:19.362 --> 02:57:21.397
oil and gas will flow up more

02:57:21.464 --> 02:57:23.065
easily affect the permeability

02:57:23.132 --> 02:57:23.599
is ten to a hundred times

02:57:23.666 --> 02:57:25.267
higher than the pre earthquake

02:57:25.334 --> 02:57:27.203
values and they used. The pre

02:57:27.269 --> 02:57:27.870
earthquake values so when they

02:57:27.937 --> 02:57:31.073
tell you that it's- you know.

02:57:31.140 --> 02:57:33.142
10% but it's likely that that

02:57:33.209 --> 02:57:33.709
it's going to. Release this

02:57:33.776 --> 02:57:35.611
verse case scenario it actually

02:57:35.678 --> 02:57:37.480
could be much more likely and

02:57:37.546 --> 02:57:41.150
we need to keep that in mind. I

02:57:41.217 --> 02:57:41.817
shut down the water with doctor

02:57:41.884 --> 02:57:43.352
dated may fifth they wrote me

02:57:43.419 --> 02:57:43.953
back a month later saying my

02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:45.388
comments are gonna be

02:57:45.454 --> 02:57:46.022
considered I'm gonna take them

02:57:46.088 --> 02:57:47.523
at their at their word for that

02:57:47.590 --> 02:57:49.425
because- they actually did do a

02:57:49.492 --> 02:57:51.160
very good job and it's a-

02:57:51.227 --> 02:57:53.095
detailed comments. Before they

02:57:53.162 --> 02:57:55.097
issue the seismic study and-

02:57:55.164 --> 02:57:57.099
all those things have been

02:57:57.166 --> 02:57:57.733
addressed in the seismic study

02:57:57.800 --> 02:57:59.268
they've done a very good job of

02:57:59.335 --> 02:57:59.902
listening. And not so I want to

02:57:59.969 --> 02:58:01.470
give them some credit for

02:58:01.537 --> 02:58:03.339
getting it. This is a seismic

02:58:03.406 --> 02:58:05.107
study to be so comprehensive.

02:58:05.174 --> 02:58:07.209
It does need some more work.

02:58:07.276 --> 02:58:09.111
From here. So strong summary

02:58:09.178 --> 02:58:11.213
worst case scenario. Eight

02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:13.249
times the missions of the

02:58:13.315 --> 02:58:15.117
twenty fifteen blowout. And

02:58:15.184 --> 02:58:15.751
they need to revise their model

02:58:15.818 --> 02:58:17.353
to provide you an actor

02:58:17.420 --> 02:58:19.388
probability of. How likely is

02:58:19.455 --> 02:58:23.192
that worst case scenario. If we

02:58:23.259 --> 02:58:23.826
just look at the report at face

02:58:23.893 --> 02:58:25.461
value. I can tell you that

02:58:25.528 --> 02:58:27.530
there's a 5% chance of a large

02:58:27.596 --> 02:58:29.231
of a sufficiently large

02:58:29.298 --> 02:58:29.799
earthquake in the next fifty

02:58:29.865 --> 02:58:31.167
years of that happening. And if

02:58:31.233 --> 02:58:31.801
that earthquake happens there's

02:58:31.867 --> 02:58:35.204
at least a 10% chance that this

02:58:35.271 --> 02:58:37.139
worst case scenario becomes a

02:58:37.206 --> 02:58:37.773
reality. And that sort of where

02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:39.542
we're left but like I said I

02:58:39.608 --> 02:58:43.279
would I would like. Them to

02:58:43.345 --> 02:58:43.913
give us a more accurate view of

02:58:43.979 --> 02:58:44.547
what those probabilities really

02:58:44.613 --> 02:58:49.385
are. Thank you. Thank you

02:58:49.452 --> 02:58:51.287
doctor dealers you for scaring.

02:58:51.353 --> 02:58:51.887
Everyone in the room with very

02:58:51.954 --> 02:58:53.355
sober science. Not a scare

02:58:53.422 --> 02:58:57.126
tactic by any means but

02:58:57.193 --> 02:58:57.593
accurate modeling and

02:58:57.660 --> 02:58:59.462
independent science I think as

02:58:59.528 --> 02:59:01.230
we've seen today from both

02:59:01.297 --> 02:59:03.132
doctor Krishnamoorthy yourself

02:59:03.199 --> 02:59:07.336
miss more Dick is really. The

02:59:07.403 --> 02:59:09.171
primary backstop we as a public.

02:59:09.238 --> 02:59:11.440
Have because in our with our

02:59:11.507 --> 02:59:13.375
limited committee staff and the

02:59:13.442 --> 02:59:15.578
work we're able to do here in

02:59:15.644 --> 02:59:17.379
the legislature the onus is

02:59:17.446 --> 02:59:21.183
huge so without your efforts.

02:59:21.250 --> 02:59:23.352
We would be out we would be

02:59:23.419 --> 02:59:27.556
lost so thank you. I wanted to

02:59:27.623 --> 02:59:31.660
ask. Yeah I don't know if

02:59:31.727 --> 02:59:32.261
doctor Krishnamoorthy is still

02:59:32.328 --> 02:59:35.364
here actually do you mind. So

02:59:35.431 --> 02:59:39.335
in the event of a. Of a size

02:59:39.401 --> 02:59:43.572
make a seismic event like the

02:59:43.639 --> 02:59:47.276
one Dr Alessio outlined and

02:59:47.343 --> 02:59:47.910
they it would take because the

02:59:47.977 --> 02:59:49.478
rupture of the casing and

02:59:49.545 --> 02:59:51.413
tubing below ground I'm is

02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:53.315
there anything the field

02:59:53.382 --> 02:59:55.217
operator can actually do to

02:59:55.284 --> 03:00:01.157
prevent that gas from from

03:00:01.223 --> 03:00:01.757
completely emptying into the

03:00:01.824 --> 03:00:03.659
air and into our community. We

03:00:03.726 --> 03:00:05.561
love to study that because I

03:00:05.628 --> 03:00:07.663
don't have a quick answer for

03:00:07.730 --> 03:00:09.632
that we've asked that question

03:00:09.698 --> 03:00:11.167
of the veteran are also it's

03:00:11.233 --> 03:00:11.700
something we need to think

03:00:11.767 --> 03:00:13.602
about I don't have an immediate

03:00:13.669 --> 03:00:17.540
answer. But I'm I would like to

03:00:17.606 --> 03:00:19.742
look at it reservist had it a

03:00:19.808 --> 03:00:21.210
little bit this is not a I

03:00:21.277 --> 03:00:23.279
recognize the possibility there

03:00:23.345 --> 03:00:25.447
off of massive massive shearing

03:00:25.514 --> 03:00:27.349
off sure val-d'or and down.

03:00:27.416 --> 03:00:29.318
Some of the men friends some of

03:00:29.385 --> 03:00:31.187
them on for and so is it fair

03:00:31.253 --> 03:00:31.754
to say though that the kill

03:00:31.820 --> 03:00:35.291
techniques that were both used

03:00:35.357 --> 03:00:37.426
by boots and coots as well as

03:00:37.493 --> 03:00:39.361
some of the techniques that you

03:00:39.428 --> 03:00:41.430
felt would have maybe been more

03:00:41.497 --> 03:00:41.897
reasonable under those

03:00:41.964 --> 03:00:43.566
circumstances none of those

03:00:43.632 --> 03:00:45.601
techniques would would work in

03:00:45.668 --> 03:00:49.305
the case that there was a total

03:00:49.371 --> 03:00:51.607
rupture. Fracture of the tubing

03:00:51.674 --> 03:00:52.174
casing it some other method

03:00:52.241 --> 03:00:53.776
would have to be devised the

03:00:53.842 --> 03:00:55.678
conventional kill technique may

03:00:55.744 --> 03:00:57.613
not work because you don't have

03:00:57.680 --> 03:00:59.448
access to the World War but to

03:00:59.515 --> 03:01:01.450
me it really felt like work so

03:01:01.517 --> 03:01:02.051
there are there are ways to do

03:01:02.117 --> 03:01:03.686
this but that's why I don't

03:01:03.752 --> 03:01:05.754
want to. Really felt maybe an

03:01:05.821 --> 03:01:06.322
option to maybe some other

03:01:06.388 --> 03:01:07.723
options but a conventional just

03:01:07.790 --> 03:01:09.525
pumping fluid but we talked

03:01:09.592 --> 03:01:11.293
about yeah but pretty new

03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:13.395
territory when it comes to on

03:01:13.462 --> 03:01:17.299
it well emergency response

03:01:17.366 --> 03:01:19.435
efforts would you say I don't

03:01:19.501 --> 03:01:21.570
know that that's all I can look

03:01:21.637 --> 03:01:23.606
at it and I can get back to you

03:01:23.672 --> 03:01:24.273
okay we can we can look at it

03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:27.309
and we can we can circle back

03:01:27.376 --> 03:01:27.876
okay I'm not convinced that

03:01:27.943 --> 03:01:29.511
isn't any work done on it but-

03:01:29.578 --> 03:01:31.313
I'm I'm not a big deal okay.

03:01:31.380 --> 03:01:33.682
Thank you at and I don't know

03:01:33.749 --> 03:01:41.690
if. It Dogger at Mister

03:01:41.757 --> 03:01:47.596
Marshall just. Apologies but

03:01:47.663 --> 03:01:48.097
eight what one follow up

03:01:48.163 --> 03:01:49.431
question there though was. The

03:01:49.498 --> 03:01:51.567
seismic analysis I forget the

03:01:51.634 --> 03:01:53.502
exact name in statute or what

03:01:53.569 --> 03:01:54.136
you you what you all called it

03:01:54.203 --> 03:01:55.571
it was your seismic risk

03:01:55.638 --> 03:01:56.171
analysis yes yes I would risk

03:01:56.238 --> 03:02:01.543
analysis so. That's. What gets

03:02:01.610 --> 03:02:03.312
done in terms of emergency

03:02:03.379 --> 03:02:05.614
response plan. Relative to the

03:02:05.681 --> 03:02:07.316
facility we have received

03:02:07.383 --> 03:02:09.351
comments from doctor let's see.

03:02:09.418 --> 03:02:11.320
And we're in the process right

03:02:11.387 --> 03:02:11.920
now reviewing that reporters

03:02:11.987 --> 03:02:13.555
ourselves we've got the

03:02:13.622 --> 03:02:15.457
California Geological Survey

03:02:15.524 --> 03:02:17.426
doing a review of that they

03:02:17.493 --> 03:02:18.060
actually asked me today to make

03:02:18.127 --> 03:02:19.828
sure I extend an invitation to

03:02:19.895 --> 03:02:21.563
doctor listening to come join

03:02:21.630 --> 03:02:23.632
them on the on the review of

03:02:23.699 --> 03:02:25.601
that. With the national labs

03:02:25.668 --> 03:02:27.703
but the point of that that that

03:02:27.770 --> 03:02:31.340
analysis is really as I view it

03:02:31.407 --> 03:02:32.007
to inform. What are we going to

03:02:32.074 --> 03:02:33.742
require in terms of emergency

03:02:33.809 --> 03:02:35.744
response planning relative to

03:02:35.811 --> 03:02:37.646
the facility understanding how

03:02:37.713 --> 03:02:39.448
much movements going to Kerr

03:02:39.515 --> 03:02:41.517
what is the probability of. Of

03:02:41.583 --> 03:02:43.485
rupture of wells what is the

03:02:43.552 --> 03:02:45.487
probability of rupture and see

03:02:45.554 --> 03:02:47.589
sharing and ceiling versus

03:02:47.656 --> 03:02:49.792
sharing and leaving open to.

03:02:49.858 --> 03:02:51.593
Again doctor Lester said.

03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:53.796
Transport of gas but a fault

03:02:53.862 --> 03:02:55.698
plane versus up of outside of

03:02:55.764 --> 03:02:57.800
it well casing were even inside

03:02:57.866 --> 03:02:59.535
of a well casing. Those are

03:02:59.601 --> 03:03:01.370
considerations that we've got

03:03:01.437 --> 03:03:03.439
to figure out and get right. We

03:03:03.505 --> 03:03:07.643
ourselves internally C. G. S.

03:03:07.710 --> 03:03:09.878
looking at the work that was

03:03:09.945 --> 03:03:11.580
done by the consultant. Have

03:03:11.647 --> 03:03:15.651
have some concerns about some

03:03:15.718 --> 03:03:19.388
of the qualifications of the

03:03:19.455 --> 03:03:21.757
people in terms of. Not to put

03:03:21.824 --> 03:03:23.692
too fine a point on it

03:03:23.759 --> 03:03:24.259
licensure in California to

03:03:24.326 --> 03:03:25.661
practice geology. Other

03:03:25.728 --> 03:03:26.328
elements that we really want to

03:03:26.395 --> 03:03:27.596
make sure we get right so that

03:03:27.663 --> 03:03:29.431
we can. Make sure that the

03:03:29.498 --> 03:03:30.032
operator provides us with an

03:03:30.099 --> 03:03:31.800
emergency plan. That addresses

03:03:31.867 --> 03:03:33.669
the real the high probability

03:03:33.736 --> 03:03:37.706
issues. And the and the analyst

03:03:37.773 --> 03:03:38.240
of the consultants you're

03:03:38.307 --> 03:03:39.742
referring to are the internal

03:03:39.808 --> 03:03:43.379
folks I retained by the gas

03:03:43.445 --> 03:03:43.912
company to do their their

03:03:43.979 --> 03:03:45.714
emergency response plans the

03:03:45.781 --> 03:03:49.685
gas company did the- skinny

03:03:49.752 --> 03:03:51.520
that had the seismic review

03:03:51.587 --> 03:03:53.622
commission. We're now reviewing

03:03:53.689 --> 03:03:54.223
it they have to prepare their

03:03:54.289 --> 03:03:57.626
own it plan. For emergency

03:03:57.693 --> 03:03:59.628
response we have to review it

03:03:59.695 --> 03:04:05.634
and be okay with it. And so

03:04:05.701 --> 03:04:06.201
we're we're wanting to make

03:04:06.268 --> 03:04:11.540
sure that these pieces the size.

03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:13.742
Valuation is then well

03:04:13.809 --> 03:04:14.309
reflected in that emergency

03:04:14.376 --> 03:04:15.577
response understood so this.

03:04:15.644 --> 03:04:17.880
Undecided excerpt that doctor

03:04:17.946 --> 03:04:19.715
DLS you gave us to. Buy I

03:04:19.782 --> 03:04:20.249
forget the exact phrasing

03:04:20.315 --> 03:04:23.719
normally does not. That's the

03:04:23.786 --> 03:04:25.788
kind of. Sort of presumption

03:04:25.854 --> 03:04:27.923
that you'll be kicking the

03:04:27.990 --> 03:04:28.424
tires on as an agency

03:04:28.490 --> 03:04:29.858
absolutely okay thank you Sir.

03:04:29.925 --> 03:04:31.794
Summers Smith did you did you

03:04:31.860 --> 03:04:33.695
have any other comments for

03:04:33.762 --> 03:04:35.597
doctor dealers you had one more

03:04:35.664 --> 03:04:36.198
for me is more tech but I turn

03:04:36.265 --> 03:04:36.765
it back to what we're on the

03:04:36.832 --> 03:04:41.737
topic. The one other thing I

03:04:41.804 --> 03:04:45.541
just I what I wanted to go to

03:04:45.607 --> 03:04:47.776
identify here. Talked about

03:04:47.843 --> 03:04:49.711
some of the potential

03:04:49.778 --> 03:04:53.582
inadequacies in the lack of

03:04:53.649 --> 03:04:55.851
detail in the a risk management

03:04:55.918 --> 03:04:56.452
think the lack of guidance in

03:04:56.518 --> 03:05:01.690
sort of. In in a number of the

03:05:01.757 --> 03:05:02.357
aspects of the regulations were

03:05:02.424 --> 03:05:03.959
sort of left potentially to the

03:05:04.026 --> 03:05:05.661
discretion either of the

03:05:05.727 --> 03:05:07.596
regulator or the regulated it

03:05:07.663 --> 03:05:11.867
so. As well as sort of

03:05:11.934 --> 03:05:15.637
disclosure issues. Do you think

03:05:15.704 --> 03:05:17.539
they that there's a story under

03:05:17.606 --> 03:05:21.643
existing law. To enact those

03:05:21.710 --> 03:05:23.545
sort of more rigorous

03:05:23.612 --> 03:05:24.146
requirements or do you think

03:05:24.213 --> 03:05:24.780
there would need to be a change

03:05:24.847 --> 03:05:27.649
in statute potentially. This

03:05:27.716 --> 03:05:31.553
statute allow them the agency

03:05:31.620 --> 03:05:32.154
to undertake that the sort of

03:05:32.221 --> 03:05:35.657
more rigorous regulation. Well

03:05:35.724 --> 03:05:37.659
not a lawyer but I would yes I

03:05:37.726 --> 03:05:39.862
would assume presume that it

03:05:39.928 --> 03:05:40.462
does yes I don't think there's

03:05:40.529 --> 03:05:41.930
certainly anything that would

03:05:41.997 --> 03:05:43.799
prevent them from from being as

03:05:43.866 --> 03:05:44.399
protective as they want to be

03:05:44.466 --> 03:05:49.805
in. My supposition based on the

03:05:49.872 --> 03:05:51.573
comments from secretary

03:05:51.640 --> 03:05:53.642
crowfoot earlier is that. It

03:05:53.709 --> 03:05:54.243
sounds like we have a willing

03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:57.713
partner to work. With us. As

03:05:57.779 --> 03:06:00.082
well as within the agency I've

03:06:00.148 --> 03:06:01.884
heard them specifically

03:06:01.950 --> 03:06:03.685
reference Senate bill four

03:06:03.752 --> 03:06:04.286
sixty three which is in the

03:06:04.353 --> 03:06:05.854
Appropriations Committee. In

03:06:05.921 --> 03:06:07.890
the assembly. Of for those of

03:06:07.956 --> 03:06:09.825
you paying attention and

03:06:09.892 --> 03:06:11.727
perhaps that could be a- a good

03:06:11.793 --> 03:06:15.697
vehicle to. Make doubly sure

03:06:15.764 --> 03:06:17.866
that some of the conclusions

03:06:17.933 --> 03:06:19.768
you're looking at are followed

03:06:19.835 --> 03:06:23.872
through on. And you know we do

03:06:23.939 --> 03:06:25.807
I do fundamentally trust

03:06:25.874 --> 03:06:29.645
governor Newsome. I think he

03:06:29.711 --> 03:06:30.245
has not given us reason to

03:06:30.312 --> 03:06:31.914
doubt that trust at this point

03:06:31.980 --> 03:06:33.982
but we are certainly going to

03:06:34.049 --> 03:06:36.018
hold him to the promise he made

03:06:36.084 --> 03:06:39.855
to you all. And expect him to

03:06:39.922 --> 03:06:43.592
make good on that and hopefully

03:06:43.659 --> 03:06:45.594
we can do that by force of law.

03:06:45.661 --> 03:06:49.831
Assembly members. Any parting

03:06:49.898 --> 03:06:55.604
comments here. So with that

03:06:55.671 --> 03:06:56.204
your testimony is been hugely

03:06:56.271 --> 03:06:58.006
helpful will be leaning on you

03:06:58.073 --> 03:06:59.908
as we go forward in both

03:06:59.975 --> 03:07:01.810
developing so regi statute and

03:07:01.877 --> 03:07:04.012
I think you already heard from

03:07:04.079 --> 03:07:06.048
the agency from C. son you know

03:07:06.114 --> 03:07:07.816

thank you both for making the

03:07:11.954 --> 03:07:14.122
trip here today and for your

03:07:14.189 --> 03:07:21.830
testimony going forward. Thank

you senator now we're gonna be

03:07:24.099 --> 03:07:24.600
moving on to the emergency

03:07:24.666 --> 03:07:26.101
response portion of today's

03:07:26.168 --> 03:07:28.170
hearing I'd like to invite to

03:07:28.236 --> 03:07:30.205
join us for their testimony Dr

03:07:31.907 --> 03:07:33.609
toxicology and environmental

03:07:33.675 --> 03:07:34.209
assessment for the LA county

03:07:34.276 --> 03:07:36.044

then we'll follow up with

03:07:57.299 --> 03:08:04.039
questions. Got it test test

03:08:04.106 --> 03:08:10.078
okay. Thank very much the

03:08:10.145 --> 03:08:13.715
opportunity to speaker Dr Cyrus

03:08:13.782 --> 03:08:14.282
Rankin with the Los Angeles

03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:14.883
county department of public

03:08:14.950 --> 03:08:17.919
health and what I wanted to do

03:08:17.986 --> 03:08:18.487
at this time is to give a

03:08:18.553 --> 03:08:21.790
little bit of background in

03:08:21.857 --> 03:08:22.391
sort of a re establishment for

03:08:22.457 --> 03:08:24.192
everybody about what it is that

03:08:24.259 --> 03:08:24.793
the public health departments

03:08:24.860 --> 03:08:27.796
here for and what our role has

03:08:27.863 --> 03:08:28.263
been throughout this.

03:08:28.330 --> 03:08:30.132
Throughout this time throughout

03:08:30.198 --> 03:08:32.000
the disaster and throughout the

03:08:32.067 --> 03:08:32.668
time after the disaster up till

03:08:32.734 --> 03:08:35.737
now the Los Angeles county

03:08:35.804 --> 03:08:36.371
department of public health is

03:08:36.438 --> 03:08:38.106
tasked with protecting the

03:08:38.173 --> 03:08:39.875
health of the public through

03:08:39.941 --> 03:08:40.475
prevention and mitigation of

03:08:40.542 --> 03:08:43.812
human health threats now the

03:08:43.879 --> 03:08:44.346
lease okay any natural gas

03:08:44.413 --> 03:08:46.048
disaster was. An unprecedented

03:08:46.114 --> 03:08:48.083
event as we all know it's

03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:49.885
regarded as the worst natural

03:08:49.951 --> 03:08:51.920
gas catastrophe at at any

03:08:51.987 --> 03:08:55.924
regulated facility. When you

03:08:55.991 --> 03:08:57.993
look at the- cause analysis and

03:08:58.060 --> 03:08:59.995
the testimonial that we just

03:09:00.062 --> 03:09:02.030
heard about the seismic issues

03:09:02.097 --> 03:09:03.865
which obviously need a lot more

03:09:03.932 --> 03:09:05.767
study you did the health

03:09:05.834 --> 03:09:07.836
department has always taken the

03:09:07.903 --> 03:09:08.437
stance in the past at least

03:09:08.503 --> 03:09:11.740
that this facility never should

03:09:11.807 --> 03:09:12.307
have reopened without that

03:09:12.374 --> 03:09:15.977
information being known and now

03:09:16.044 --> 03:09:17.913
that it is known in that way

03:09:17.979 --> 03:09:18.480
now that we have emerging

03:09:18.547 --> 03:09:19.981
information about that. Let me

03:09:20.048 --> 03:09:22.084
just single out our our

03:09:22.150 --> 03:09:23.752
director of health protection

03:09:23.819 --> 03:09:25.921
tucked it Mister blow has that

03:09:25.987 --> 03:09:26.521
stance changed at all for the

03:09:26.588 --> 03:09:27.889
public health department. No we

03:09:27.956 --> 03:09:29.891
still have that stance that's

03:09:29.958 --> 03:09:30.492
the stance we had they never

03:09:30.559 --> 03:09:31.927
should have reopened and- and

03:09:31.993 --> 03:09:34.129
given what we are now learning.

03:09:34.196 --> 03:09:36.164
It's becoming more and more

03:09:36.231 --> 03:09:36.798
clear that perhaps they should

03:09:36.865 --> 03:09:38.166
not be open at all. When you

03:09:38.233 --> 03:09:41.803
look we when you listen to.

03:09:41.870 --> 03:09:44.272
When you yeah and if you've

03:09:44.339 --> 03:09:44.873
ever heard Lucy Jones is the

03:09:44.940 --> 03:09:46.208
director geological sciences at

03:09:46.274 --> 03:09:48.143
cal tech I mean you know she

03:09:48.210 --> 03:09:49.945
she says all the time. We were

03:09:50.011 --> 03:09:51.780
expecting some big one you know

03:09:51.847 --> 03:09:52.447
something on this. On the same

03:09:52.514 --> 03:09:54.149
scale and magnitude as the

03:09:54.216 --> 03:09:55.951
Northridge quake. We have

03:09:56.017 --> 03:09:56.618
something like that going on we

03:09:56.685 --> 03:09:58.220
may not be looking at one well

03:09:58.286 --> 03:10:00.255
we may be looking at multiple

03:10:00.322 --> 03:10:00.789
wells and then we're not

03:10:00.856 --> 03:10:02.057
talking about. Voluntary

03:10:02.124 --> 03:10:04.192
relocation of this community

03:10:04.259 --> 03:10:04.793
we're talking about mandatory

03:10:04.860 --> 03:10:07.896
evacuation and that's a- whole

03:10:07.963 --> 03:10:08.497
other endeavor which really

03:10:08.563 --> 03:10:11.900
could be quite catastrophic. So

03:10:11.967 --> 03:10:14.169
that's the stance that we have

03:10:14.236 --> 03:10:15.937
at the at the department of

03:10:16.004 --> 03:10:16.605
public health. Now we were made

03:10:16.671 --> 03:10:18.106
aware of the event after our

03:10:18.173 --> 03:10:20.075
county. Fire department

03:10:20.142 --> 03:10:22.010
colleagues were informed by by

03:10:22.077 --> 03:10:24.012
field personnel back in two

03:10:24.079 --> 03:10:25.947
thousand fifteen. Shortly

03:10:26.014 --> 03:10:27.783
thereafter just within a matter

03:10:27.849 --> 03:10:28.383
of a couple of days. Public

03:10:28.450 --> 03:10:29.785
health began to receive health

03:10:29.851 --> 03:10:30.418
complaints from members of the

03:10:30.485 --> 03:10:32.087
community. That included

03:10:32.154 --> 03:10:34.022
headache. Nose bleeds

03:10:34.089 --> 03:10:34.589
gastrointestinal respiratory

03:10:34.656 --> 03:10:37.959
symptoms. Among others. And as

03:10:38.026 --> 03:10:38.527
these complaints mounted and

03:10:38.593 --> 03:10:40.162
expanded geographically

03:10:40.228 --> 03:10:42.297
throughout the throughout the

03:10:42.364 --> 03:10:43.965
neighborhoods in the committee

03:10:44.032 --> 03:10:45.801
of Porter ranch and others. It

03:10:45.867 --> 03:10:48.069
beyond Porter ranch. The gas

03:10:48.136 --> 03:10:49.805
company determined that the-

03:10:49.871 --> 03:10:50.438
time frame to stop the flow of

03:10:50.505 --> 03:10:52.207
gas for messes twenty five

03:10:52.274 --> 03:10:54.042
would extend. Far beyond their

03:10:54.109 --> 03:10:56.077
additional estimates and so at

03:10:56.144 --> 03:10:56.745
that time public health ordered

03:10:56.812 --> 03:10:58.113
the gas company to provide.

03:10:58.180 --> 03:11:00.048
Relocation assistance to any

03:11:00.115 --> 03:11:02.050
household who who desired it.

03:11:02.117 --> 03:11:06.087
Now public health. I will tell

03:11:06.154 --> 03:11:07.989
you now did not receive

03:11:08.056 --> 03:11:10.025
sufficient. Cooperation from

03:11:10.091 --> 03:11:12.093
the gas company throughout this

03:11:12.160 --> 03:11:13.995
response. Now while the

03:11:14.062 --> 03:11:14.563
cooperation was earnest at

03:11:14.629 --> 03:11:16.398
first. Soon thereafter there

03:11:16.464 --> 03:11:18.066
was a market lack of

03:11:18.133 --> 03:11:18.600
cooperation from the gas

03:11:18.667 --> 03:11:20.235
company bordering on

03:11:20.302 --> 03:11:20.802
belligerence and ultimately

03:11:20.869 --> 03:11:22.170
deception. And the public

03:11:22.237 --> 03:11:24.306
health of public health apart

03:11:24.372 --> 03:11:26.074
was unable to contain. I'm

03:11:26.141 --> 03:11:28.176
sorry to obtain. A critical

03:11:28.243 --> 03:11:30.045
pieces of information that we

03:11:30.111 --> 03:11:32.080
repeatedly requested from the

03:11:32.147 --> 03:11:34.249
gas company. Just a couple of

03:11:34.316 --> 03:11:37.919
examples we never received

03:11:37.986 --> 03:11:38.486
critical data regarding the

03:11:38.553 --> 03:11:40.222
composition of the source gas

03:11:40.288 --> 03:11:43.925
which we ask for consistently

03:11:43.992 --> 03:11:44.559
from the get go. Composition of

03:11:44.626 --> 03:11:45.126
the drilling was there were

03:11:45.193 --> 03:11:48.263
utilized. For the attempted

03:11:48.330 --> 03:11:48.797
well well kills and then

03:11:48.864 --> 03:11:49.431
consequently spewed out in the

03:11:49.497 --> 03:11:50.232
form of an oily mist and the

03:11:50.298 --> 03:11:50.765
landing on properties in

03:11:50.832 --> 03:11:51.933
causing more problems. And that

03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:52.567
being said we're now. Learning

03:11:52.634 --> 03:11:53.134
for the root cause analysis

03:11:53.201 --> 03:11:54.035
that they weren't even using

03:11:54.102 --> 03:11:54.603
the right kinds of drilling

03:11:54.669 --> 03:11:56.238
muds and that. It would became

03:11:56.304 --> 03:11:58.139
clear that even. Though they

03:11:58.206 --> 03:11:59.941
did several well kill attempts

03:12:00.008 --> 03:12:02.077
that maybe. They were getting

03:12:02.143 --> 03:12:03.945
evidence that well kilotons

03:12:04.012 --> 03:12:04.512
wouldn't be wouldn't work

03:12:04.579 --> 03:12:06.114
anyway so we're looking at

03:12:06.181 --> 03:12:07.916
looking at a process and I'm

03:12:07.983 --> 03:12:08.550
Noah engineer but we're looking

03:12:08.617 --> 03:12:09.150
at a price that they seem to

03:12:09.217 --> 03:12:10.385
have no efficacy. But certainly

03:12:10.452 --> 03:12:12.254
jeopardize the safety of the

03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:14.289
community by the oily mess that

03:12:14.356 --> 03:12:16.024
got spewed out with all the-

03:12:16.091 --> 03:12:16.524
attended kills that were

03:12:16.591 --> 03:12:19.928
unsuccessful. And so that led

03:12:19.995 --> 03:12:20.528
to oily residue on people's

03:12:20.595 --> 03:12:22.397
homes it may have lead led to

03:12:22.464 --> 03:12:24.332
the trans location of chemicals

03:12:24.399 --> 03:12:26.268
metals and others. Into homes

03:12:26.334 --> 03:12:28.203
that we did in a in a limited

03:12:28.270 --> 03:12:29.938
environmental investigation.

03:12:30.005 --> 03:12:30.438
And we've requested the

03:12:30.505 --> 03:12:32.307
database of homes that were

03:12:32.374 --> 03:12:34.309
cleaned or affected or tested

03:12:34.376 --> 03:12:38.146
by it so cal gas. Not a word on

03:12:38.213 --> 03:12:38.580
that. We asked for

03:12:38.647 --> 03:12:40.081
comprehensive chemical testing

03:12:40.148 --> 03:12:42.117
of the air starting in November

03:12:42.183 --> 03:12:42.784
two thousand fifteen as soon as

03:12:42.851 --> 03:12:44.552
the well. As soon as it became

03:12:44.619 --> 03:12:46.354
clear that this is going to

03:12:46.421 --> 03:12:48.189
last awhile that was not begun

03:12:48.256 --> 03:12:50.258
by so cal gas until January two

03:12:50.325 --> 03:12:52.127
thousand sixteen well past the

03:12:52.193 --> 03:12:54.129
peak of the event. So without

03:12:54.195 --> 03:12:55.997
these critical pieces of

03:12:56.064 --> 03:12:57.933
information public health. Did

03:12:57.999 --> 03:12:59.935
not have enough data to fully

03:13:00.001 --> 03:13:00.502
characterized the potential

03:13:00.568 --> 03:13:06.107
risks to human health. From the

03:13:06.174 --> 03:13:06.675
emissions and the extent of

03:13:06.741 --> 03:13:10.045
exposures that occurred. And

03:13:10.111 --> 03:13:12.247
finally public health was made

03:13:12.314 --> 03:13:12.881
aware through a permit renewal

03:13:12.948 --> 03:13:14.516
process that was required by

03:13:14.582 --> 03:13:15.150
the south coast EQ indeed. Of

03:13:15.216 --> 03:13:16.184
treatment systems utilized at

03:13:16.251 --> 03:13:17.953
the field. To remove crude oil

03:13:18.019 --> 03:13:20.088
routinely from stored natural

03:13:20.155 --> 03:13:22.190
gas before being served into

03:13:22.257 --> 03:13:24.192
the distribution system. Gas

03:13:24.259 --> 03:13:26.061
company never disclosed that

03:13:26.127 --> 03:13:27.996
critical piece of information a

03:13:28.063 --> 03:13:28.530
public health during the

03:13:28.596 --> 03:13:30.398
disaster. That crude oil was

03:13:30.465 --> 03:13:32.200
indeed contained in its natural

03:13:32.267 --> 03:13:34.269
gas mixture. So this wasn't

03:13:34.336 --> 03:13:36.071
just a natural gas exposure

03:13:36.137 --> 03:13:38.206
this is a crude oil exposure as

03:13:38.273 --> 03:13:40.175
well. We didn't know that they

03:13:40.241 --> 03:13:42.177
didn't tell us. So this

03:13:42.243 --> 03:13:44.312
critically impacted our

03:13:44.379 --> 03:13:44.913
assessments of human exposure

03:13:44.980 --> 03:13:48.216
during the disaster. Out Los

03:13:48.283 --> 03:13:48.817
Angeles county has taken some

03:13:48.883 --> 03:13:50.218
steps to try to address the

03:13:50.285 --> 03:13:52.420
situation for future responses

03:13:52.487 --> 03:13:54.222
to try to improve response

03:13:54.289 --> 03:13:54.856
should a similar issue occurred

03:13:54.923 --> 03:13:58.059
to occur again unfortunately no

03:13:58.126 --> 03:13:58.626
significant changes taking

03:13:58.693 --> 03:14:00.195
place up from the gas company

03:14:00.261 --> 03:14:02.197
to improve that dynamic for the

03:14:02.263 --> 03:14:02.797
future we would unfortunately

03:14:02.864 --> 03:14:04.432
expected experience the same

03:14:04.499 --> 03:14:06.201
issues again with the gas

03:14:06.267 --> 03:14:08.136
company if for example an

03:14:08.203 --> 03:14:10.271
earthquake were to cause a

03:14:10.338 --> 03:14:12.207
similar disaster. And public

03:14:12.273 --> 03:14:12.707
health unfortunately as

03:14:12.774 --> 03:14:14.409
department we don't have the

03:14:14.476 --> 03:14:16.444
regulatory regulatory authority

03:14:16.511 --> 03:14:20.248
at this time to demand

03:14:20.315 --> 03:14:20.915
information from a facility and

03:14:20.982 --> 03:14:22.484
to get it such as this at the

03:14:22.550 --> 03:14:24.352
time the disaster we don't have

03:14:24.419 --> 03:14:26.488
that authority or at any other

03:14:26.554 --> 03:14:30.091
time when the health department

03:14:30.158 --> 03:14:30.658
sorry when the health of the

03:14:30.725 --> 03:14:32.127
public is threatened.

03:14:32.193 --> 03:14:32.727
Regulatory authority generally

03:14:32.794 --> 03:14:34.529
rests with the state. But again

03:14:34.596 --> 03:14:36.398
the state regulators third not

03:14:36.464 --> 03:14:38.199
health officials right their

03:14:38.266 --> 03:14:38.800
environmental regulators and

03:14:38.867 --> 03:14:40.568
engineers not health officials

03:14:40.635 --> 03:14:41.136
when health is at stake for

03:14:41.202 --> 03:14:42.470
talks releases from Lisa

03:14:42.537 --> 03:14:44.372
canyon. Public health is the

03:14:44.439 --> 03:14:46.474
only such authority who has the

03:14:46.541 --> 03:14:47.042
sole mission to protect the

03:14:47.108 --> 03:14:48.510
health of the community. So Los

03:14:48.576 --> 03:14:50.278
Angeles county is work to

03:14:50.345 --> 03:14:52.113
expand that authority to demand

03:14:52.180 --> 03:14:54.115
immediate data to compel

03:14:54.182 --> 03:14:54.749
responsible parties to initiate

03:14:54.816 --> 03:14:56.384
environmental investigations.

03:14:56.451 --> 03:14:58.420
And to provide temporary relief

03:14:58.486 --> 03:15:00.288
to or to relocate affected

03:15:00.355 --> 03:15:02.190
individuals without delay and

03:15:02.257 --> 03:15:04.159
without antagonism. Now Los

03:15:04.225 --> 03:15:06.127
Angeles county is sponsored a

03:15:06.194 --> 03:15:08.096
beat fifteen hundred which was

03:15:08.163 --> 03:15:10.131
as assembly bill authored by a

03:15:10.198 --> 03:15:10.665
windy Correo that's being

03:15:10.732 --> 03:15:12.400
considered currently by the

03:15:12.467 --> 03:15:14.102
state legislature. And

03:15:14.169 --> 03:15:14.769
hopefully what that's going to

03:15:14.836 --> 03:15:16.438
do is a line the health

03:15:16.504 --> 03:15:18.273
department's long standing

03:15:18.339 --> 03:15:20.475
officer authority to control

03:15:20.542 --> 03:15:22.477
infectious diseases which we do

03:15:22.544 --> 03:15:24.446
all the time. A line that with

03:15:24.512 --> 03:15:26.281
an ability to control chemical

03:15:26.347 --> 03:15:28.116
exposures caused by responsible

03:15:28.183 --> 03:15:30.118
parties like the gas company

03:15:30.185 --> 03:15:30.718
that's where we lack of forty

03:15:30.785 --> 03:15:32.120
and that's what we need

03:15:32.187 --> 03:15:32.654
authority. Eighty fifteen

03:15:32.720 --> 03:15:34.456
hundred would be the first step

03:15:34.522 --> 03:15:36.491
to provide public health with

03:15:36.558 --> 03:15:37.058
the necessary authority to

03:15:37.125 --> 03:15:40.128
obtain cooperation and demand

03:15:40.195 --> 03:15:40.695
that from right responsible

03:15:40.762 --> 03:15:42.530
parties. In the future. In the

03:15:42.597 --> 03:15:44.466
meantime public health is

03:15:44.532 --> 03:15:46.534
working to examine the current

03:15:46.601 --> 03:15:48.570
health needs of the committee

03:15:48.636 --> 03:15:50.271
which are continuing. To this

03:15:50.338 --> 03:15:52.140
day with respect to the lease

03:15:52.207 --> 03:15:52.640
of disaster despite the

03:15:52.707 --> 03:15:56.377
stoppage of flow of gas from SS

03:15:56.444 --> 03:15:58.279
twenty five. Nearby residents

03:15:58.346 --> 03:15:58.880
continue to experience health

03:15:58.947 --> 03:16:02.217
problems to this day and as

03:16:02.283 --> 03:16:02.684
mentioned. This is an

03:16:02.750 --> 03:16:06.287
unprecedented disaster and that

03:16:06.354 --> 03:16:08.123
that means a requires

03:16:08.189 --> 03:16:12.393
unprecedented follow up and

03:16:12.460 --> 03:16:14.395
follow through to get to the

03:16:14.462 --> 03:16:18.399
bottom. Of why members of this

03:16:18.466 --> 03:16:20.301
committee are still

03:16:20.368 --> 03:16:22.303
experiencing these kinds of

03:16:22.370 --> 03:16:22.937
health issues and to determine

03:16:23.004 --> 03:16:28.176
the true impact of disaster.

03:16:28.243 --> 03:16:28.843
And the future operation of the

03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:30.612
field of for it. How that will

03:16:30.678 --> 03:16:32.147
impact nearby residents. In so

03:16:32.213 --> 03:16:32.747
we're working on this twenty

03:16:32.814 --> 03:16:33.281
five million dollar health

03:16:33.348 --> 03:16:33.915
study for the look the for the

03:16:33.982 --> 03:16:34.516
community here over the next

03:16:34.582 --> 03:16:35.150
several years to do just that.

03:16:35.216 --> 03:16:35.750
But of note however we still

03:16:35.817 --> 03:16:36.484
don't have. The necessary data

03:16:36.551 --> 03:16:37.085
that we've been requesting for

03:16:37.152 --> 03:16:40.155
years. From so cal gas. Since

03:16:40.221 --> 03:16:40.788
two thousand fifteen and that's

03:16:40.855 --> 03:16:41.356
critical to meet the health

03:16:41.422 --> 03:16:42.323
needs of the community. And

03:16:42.390 --> 03:16:42.857
without these data will

03:16:42.924 --> 03:16:46.394
continue to be in the dark and

03:16:46.461 --> 03:16:47.061
the community will continue to

03:16:47.128 --> 03:16:48.329
be in the dark about the true

03:16:48.396 --> 03:16:50.431
extent of exposures. That took

03:16:50.498 --> 03:16:52.467
place before. During and after

03:16:52.534 --> 03:16:56.404
the disaster. Thank you. Thank

03:16:56.471 --> 03:16:58.573
you doctor and I appreciate the

03:16:58.640 --> 03:16:59.240
thoughtfulness that you have in

03:16:59.307 --> 03:17:00.775
in now saying that the county

03:17:00.842 --> 03:17:02.577
department of health finds this

03:17:02.644 --> 03:17:04.679
facility to be unsafe to unsafe

03:17:04.746 --> 03:17:06.781
in fact to operate and needs to

03:17:06.848 --> 03:17:08.483
be shut down and while I

03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:10.518
understand the limitations of

03:17:10.585 --> 03:17:12.187
dealing with so cal gas

03:17:12.253 --> 03:17:12.787
throughout the course of this

03:17:12.854 --> 03:17:14.556
emergency I can also tell you

03:17:14.622 --> 03:17:16.591
that based on data that I found

03:17:16.658 --> 03:17:18.526
that was publicly available the

03:17:18.593 --> 03:17:19.093
department of public health

03:17:19.160 --> 03:17:24.499
took. Way way too few actions

03:17:24.566 --> 03:17:25.099
was woefully insufficient and

03:17:25.166 --> 03:17:28.636
their public out. We know that

03:17:28.703 --> 03:17:32.207
the league started on October

03:17:32.273 --> 03:17:34.275
twenty third twenty fifteen. On

03:17:34.342 --> 03:17:34.876
November seventh the A. Q. M.

03:17:34.943 --> 03:17:36.811
D. issues a notice a public

03:17:36.878 --> 03:17:38.513
nuisance to the facility.

03:17:38.580 --> 03:17:42.217
Noting benzene at seven times.

03:17:42.283 --> 03:17:42.750
Of reasonable and healthy

03:17:42.817 --> 03:17:46.321
level. We know that on December

03:17:46.387 --> 03:17:48.523
seventeenth as presented to the

03:17:48.590 --> 03:17:50.525
board of supervisors by interim

03:17:50.592 --> 03:17:52.694
director Cynthia Harding in a

03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:54.696
report. As early as December

03:17:54.762 --> 03:17:56.698
seventeenth there was reports

03:17:56.764 --> 03:17:58.399
of oily residue across the

03:17:58.466 --> 03:18:00.401
community on people's cars. On

03:18:00.468 --> 03:18:02.570
their homes on things in their

03:18:02.637 --> 03:18:04.539
yard. At no point between those

03:18:04.606 --> 03:18:06.474
two points to the department of

03:18:06.541 --> 03:18:07.075
public health issue a warning

03:18:07.141 --> 03:18:08.509
to the community to even be

03:18:08.576 --> 03:18:10.712
wearing respirators or to leave

03:18:10.778 --> 03:18:11.279
the community for their own

03:18:11.346 --> 03:18:20.321
safety. On February eighteenth

03:18:20.388 --> 03:18:20.888
twenty sixteen the well was

03:18:20.955 --> 03:18:26.361
officially capped. In March.

03:18:26.427 --> 03:18:30.465
March eight to be exact. After

03:18:30.531 --> 03:18:32.400
the well was capped the

03:18:32.467 --> 03:18:33.034
department of public health and

03:18:33.101 --> 03:18:34.602
you're listed as the primary

03:18:34.669 --> 03:18:36.337
contact on this information

03:18:36.404 --> 03:18:38.506
issued an advisory to local

03:18:38.573 --> 03:18:40.441
medical providers when

03:18:40.508 --> 03:18:42.343
evaluating patients presenting

03:18:42.410 --> 03:18:42.777
with mild headaches

03:18:42.844 --> 03:18:44.612
gastrointestinal or respiratory

03:18:44.679 --> 03:18:46.614
symptoms or those with other

03:18:46.681 --> 03:18:48.416
non specific complaints look

03:18:48.483 --> 03:18:50.618
for alternate ideologies other

03:18:50.685 --> 03:18:52.687
than air contamination. Avoid

03:18:52.754 --> 03:18:56.324
performing any talks a logical

03:18:56.391 --> 03:18:58.326
tests these are not recommended

03:18:58.393 --> 03:18:58.993
art and are unlikely to produce

03:18:59.060 --> 03:19:00.728
useful data. For evaluation of

03:19:00.795 --> 03:19:06.334
patients. If no alternative

03:19:06.401 --> 03:19:06.968
ideology is found and there is

03:19:07.035 --> 03:19:07.535
a concern regarding either

03:19:07.602 --> 03:19:08.736
ongoing or past environmental

03:19:08.803 --> 03:19:10.872
exposures they were to consult

03:19:10.938 --> 03:19:14.342
you. I know of one physician

03:19:14.409 --> 03:19:14.976
who chose to utterly disregard

03:19:15.043 --> 03:19:16.744
this and not physician lost his

03:19:16.811 --> 03:19:18.813
job and we've heard from this

03:19:18.880 --> 03:19:20.682
community of other physicians

03:19:20.748 --> 03:19:21.316
who felt that their hands were

03:19:21.382 --> 03:19:24.352
tied in adequately assessing

03:19:24.419 --> 03:19:24.919
the symptoms concerns and

03:19:24.986 --> 03:19:26.721
complaints that this community

03:19:26.788 --> 03:19:28.656
was suffering from. And so I

03:19:28.723 --> 03:19:29.223
would like you first of all

03:19:29.290 --> 03:19:32.627
doctor to answer why when what

03:19:32.694 --> 03:19:34.529
we know is essential in either

03:19:34.595 --> 03:19:36.898
solving. A health risk to the

03:19:36.964 --> 03:19:38.866
community or either proving or

03:19:38.933 --> 03:19:42.470
disproving his theory. Or the

03:19:42.537 --> 03:19:43.071
difference between correlation

03:19:43.137 --> 03:19:44.772
and causation that critical

03:19:44.839 --> 03:19:46.841
instrument to do that is data.

03:19:46.908 --> 03:19:49.010
And not only did we block the

03:19:49.077 --> 03:19:50.912
community from having data the

03:19:50.978 --> 03:19:52.780
response leading up to this was

03:19:52.847 --> 03:19:54.682
insufficient for them to even

03:19:54.749 --> 03:19:56.851
go to doctors to try to start

03:19:56.918 --> 03:19:58.720
to collect complete blood blood

03:19:58.786 --> 03:20:00.521
counts or urinalysis or hair

03:20:00.588 --> 03:20:04.459
analysis in order to establish

03:20:04.525 --> 03:20:06.594
the data set to protect public

03:20:06.661 --> 03:20:10.531
health. So please address the

03:20:10.598 --> 03:20:12.734
glaring gaps and please do not

03:20:12.800 --> 03:20:16.604
I understand we all know the

03:20:16.671 --> 03:20:18.806
gas company was non responsive

03:20:18.873 --> 03:20:22.643
but you work for the people of

03:20:22.710 --> 03:20:24.712
Los Angeles county. And I want

03:20:24.779 --> 03:20:25.279
to know why your department

03:20:25.346 --> 03:20:30.985
failed. What do you bring up a

03:20:31.052 --> 03:20:31.619
good point these medical issues

03:20:31.686 --> 03:20:32.186
so let me let me talk about

03:20:32.253 --> 03:20:34.856
this. Now now my trainings in

03:20:34.922 --> 03:20:36.958
medical toxicology so this is

03:20:37.024 --> 03:20:37.558
where this is my specialty and

03:20:37.625 --> 03:20:38.493
what I can tell you about these

03:20:38.559 --> 03:20:39.127
these kinds of medical tests we

03:20:39.193 --> 03:20:42.730
were telling people. To test to

03:20:42.797 --> 03:20:44.832
understand whether or not

03:20:44.899 --> 03:20:46.634
someone was being exposed to

03:20:46.701 --> 03:20:47.235
gas is firmly so canyon that

03:20:47.301 --> 03:20:48.836
were causing certain medical

03:20:48.903 --> 03:20:50.805
conditions well we were telling

03:20:50.872 --> 03:20:52.740
positions is that getting these

03:20:52.807 --> 03:20:53.307
kinds of tests getting for

03:20:53.374 --> 03:20:54.876
example a blood benzene level

03:20:54.942 --> 03:20:56.811
or bloody urine level Benteen

03:20:56.878 --> 03:20:58.913
urine level or adhere level.

03:20:58.980 --> 03:21:00.848
These are not has from the

03:21:00.915 --> 03:21:02.850
medical perspective that are

03:21:02.917 --> 03:21:04.752
interpretable to give you the

03:21:04.819 --> 03:21:06.821
kinds of data that lead you to

03:21:06.888 --> 03:21:08.689
those diagnoses. That's the

03:21:08.756 --> 03:21:10.558
problem it's not because we

03:21:10.625 --> 03:21:12.493
want to leave them a way from

03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:13.094
the diagnoses we want to make

03:21:13.161 --> 03:21:14.962
sure that that he did that they

03:21:15.029 --> 03:21:16.864
did not get misleading tests

03:21:16.931 --> 03:21:18.966
that would lead them away from

03:21:19.033 --> 03:21:22.570
the diagnoses. In addition to

03:21:22.637 --> 03:21:24.939
that in addition to that one of

03:21:25.006 --> 03:21:27.008
the reasons that we issued this

03:21:27.074 --> 03:21:29.010
advisory to physicians wise

03:21:29.076 --> 03:21:32.513
that once the well was sealed

03:21:32.580 --> 03:21:34.515
and once air level started

03:21:34.582 --> 03:21:38.519
coming back down to background.

03:21:38.586 --> 03:21:40.855
We wanted to make sure that

03:21:40.922 --> 03:21:44.659
physicians warrant need jerking

03:21:44.725 --> 03:21:48.596
and diagnosing people with at

03:21:48.663 --> 03:21:50.665
least canyon related syndrome

03:21:50.731 --> 03:21:52.667
when they might have something

03:21:52.733 --> 03:21:56.637
else I got over a call from a

03:21:56.704 --> 03:22:00.608
clinician who was saying just

03:22:00.675 --> 03:22:06.581
that to me and as it turns out

03:22:06.647 --> 03:22:10.751
his patient was a seventy plus

03:22:10.818 --> 03:22:22.663
year old. Woman who. It's a

03:22:22.730 --> 03:22:24.532
shrug of the shoulders because

03:22:24.599 --> 03:22:24.966
there is no medical

03:22:25.032 --> 03:22:26.834
toxicologist who look at those

03:22:26.901 --> 03:22:27.502
tests and say I know what your

03:22:27.568 --> 03:22:28.970
taxes to the level is. That's

03:22:29.036 --> 03:22:30.705
what we told them not to get

03:22:30.771 --> 03:22:31.339
those tests but now we have an

03:22:31.405 --> 03:22:32.740
entire community full of

03:22:32.807 --> 03:22:34.809
patients who after nearly four

03:22:34.876 --> 03:22:35.476
months of exposure have nothing

03:22:35.543 --> 03:22:36.911
on the documented record to

03:22:36.978 --> 03:22:38.713
help them with their lawsuits.

03:22:38.779 --> 03:22:39.380
And to pursue their forget fort

03:22:39.447 --> 03:22:40.882
you know future healthcare

03:22:40.948 --> 03:22:43.150
needs based on the toxicology

03:22:43.217 --> 03:22:44.619
is that they live close to.

03:22:44.685 --> 03:22:46.854
UCLA excuse me we have the UCLA

03:22:46.921 --> 03:22:48.823
study there was limited granted

03:22:48.890 --> 03:22:50.858
everything that we did in terms

03:22:50.925 --> 03:22:51.359
of collecting data was

03:22:51.425 --> 03:22:52.693
significantly limited but at

03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:54.795
twenty locations noted between

03:22:54.862 --> 03:22:56.831
January thirteenth in January

03:22:56.898 --> 03:22:58.633
fifteenth volatile organic

03:22:58.699 --> 03:23:00.535
compounds were were noted in

03:23:00.601 --> 03:23:01.135
twenty locations based on the

03:23:01.202 --> 03:23:03.037
UCLA study. And that's months

03:23:03.104 --> 03:23:05.072
of exposure that these people

03:23:05.139 --> 03:23:06.841
were exposed to any right not

03:23:06.908 --> 03:23:10.645
you not only said don't look

03:23:10.711 --> 03:23:12.813
for look for alternative five.

03:23:12.880 --> 03:23:14.815
You know the path ology is that

03:23:14.882 --> 03:23:16.817
you said avoid performing talks

03:23:16.884 --> 03:23:18.786
a logical test you specifically

03:23:18.853 --> 03:23:20.721
got in the P. in between the

03:23:20.788 --> 03:23:26.594
doctor patient relationship.

03:23:26.661 --> 03:23:27.161
And ask physicians do not to

03:23:27.228 --> 03:23:32.567
seek the best. Nine to insure

03:23:32.633 --> 03:23:33.167
that physicians would not be

03:23:33.234 --> 03:23:34.702
let down in in correct path. I

03:23:34.769 --> 03:23:35.269
can guarantee you that if

03:23:35.336 --> 03:23:36.737
anyone has take it taken those

03:23:36.804 --> 03:23:37.371
kinds of tests. And takes them

03:23:37.438 --> 03:23:37.972
and you'd mentioned lawsuits

03:23:38.039 --> 03:23:38.839
all go ahead and talk about

03:23:38.906 --> 03:23:39.440
that and takes those to their

03:23:39.507 --> 03:23:41.042
lawyer I guarantee you that

03:23:41.108 --> 03:23:42.677
there are going to be experts

03:23:42.743 --> 03:23:43.277
in the courtroom on the other

03:23:43.344 --> 03:23:44.845
side who are going to

03:23:44.912 --> 03:23:45.446
completely blow those out of

03:23:45.513 --> 03:23:46.981
the water. And so it would

03:23:47.048 --> 03:23:48.816
actually work against members

03:23:48.883 --> 03:23:49.417
of the community to get those

03:23:49.483 --> 03:23:52.987
tests if you just want to talk

03:23:53.054 --> 03:23:53.521
about lawsuits. And leave

03:23:53.588 --> 03:23:58.893
medicine the side. Was there

03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:02.964
anything other than your

03:24:03.030 --> 03:24:05.132
relying on your professional

03:24:05.199 --> 03:24:06.867
expertise in this regard was

03:24:06.934 --> 03:24:07.468
there anything in terms of a

03:24:07.535 --> 03:24:10.671
state statute that prevented

03:24:10.738 --> 03:24:13.074
you from starting to collect a

03:24:13.140 --> 03:24:16.744
data set a baseline data set of

03:24:16.811 --> 03:24:18.779
residents who were having this

03:24:18.846 --> 03:24:19.447
exposure from the time that we

03:24:19.513 --> 03:24:20.915
learned that this blow out had

03:24:20.982 --> 03:24:22.783
occurred from the moment that

03:24:22.850 --> 03:24:23.351
people started calling us we

03:24:23.417 --> 03:24:24.919
were collecting data we were

03:24:24.986 --> 03:24:26.821
collecting data on symptoms we

03:24:26.887 --> 03:24:28.689
have a and a large sum to log

03:24:28.756 --> 03:24:30.691
of hundreds if not thousands of

03:24:30.758 --> 03:24:32.760
complaints. That occurred all

03:24:32.827 --> 03:24:33.327
throughout the disaster and

03:24:33.394 --> 03:24:34.795
continue to be reported to us

03:24:34.862 --> 03:24:38.833
today we have data on the

03:24:38.899 --> 03:24:39.467
environment as well with air

03:24:39.533 --> 03:24:41.035
testing and home testing that

03:24:41.102 --> 03:24:41.569
we've done so the health

03:24:41.636 --> 03:24:42.770
department's been there to

03:24:42.837 --> 03:24:43.371
collect an immense amount of

03:24:43.437 --> 03:24:46.807
data but that being said we're

03:24:46.874 --> 03:24:50.711
fairly limited in what we can

03:24:50.778 --> 03:24:52.813
do as a health department when

03:24:52.880 --> 03:24:56.851
it comes to this sort of thing

03:24:56.917 --> 03:25:00.788
we don't have a and ability and

03:25:00.855 --> 03:25:06.727
authority to go in and Marshall

03:25:06.794 --> 03:25:08.929
those kinds of tests we have to

03:25:08.996 --> 03:25:14.702
work from the outside in. And

03:25:14.769 --> 03:25:16.871
we're getting tests on the back

03:25:16.937 --> 03:25:20.708
and I knew someone had talked

03:25:20.775 --> 03:25:26.814
about this a little bit. I'm

03:25:26.881 --> 03:25:28.716
getting those kind of results

03:25:28.783 --> 03:25:29.250
from their own physicians

03:25:29.316 --> 03:25:31.118
because if he had gotten those

03:25:31.185 --> 03:25:32.920
kinds of results they would

03:25:32.987 --> 03:25:35.089
have been misled that's the

03:25:35.156 --> 03:25:36.924
problem because those kind they

03:25:36.991 --> 03:25:37.525
would they would have been

03:25:37.591 --> 03:25:39.126
misled about what their blood

03:25:39.193 --> 03:25:40.895
and urine levels what were of

03:25:40.961 --> 03:25:43.164
volatile organic yeah and this

03:25:43.230 --> 03:25:44.965
is why because you can walk

03:25:45.032 --> 03:25:46.934
into a you can walk into a gas

03:25:47.001 --> 03:25:49.203
station for five minutes and

03:25:49.270 --> 03:25:50.871
you can have a spike in your

03:25:50.938 --> 03:25:53.007
blood level of benzene and it's

03:25:53.074 --> 03:25:54.975
something that fluctuates quite

03:25:55.042 --> 03:25:56.811
significantly throughout the

03:25:56.877 --> 03:25:57.411
day so what can happen is you

03:25:57.478 --> 03:25:59.046
can go into your doctor's

03:25:59.113 --> 03:26:00.781
office you could be exposed to

03:26:00.848 --> 03:26:02.817
tons of benzene. And you could

03:26:02.883 --> 03:26:04.819
have a benzene levels down here

03:26:04.885 --> 03:26:06.821
and suddenly you're not using

03:26:06.887 --> 03:26:08.989
your benzene levels find

03:26:09.056 --> 03:26:11.192
therefore you were exposed to

03:26:11.258 --> 03:26:14.829
fencing that would have been

03:26:14.895 --> 03:26:17.198
misleading or you could have a

03:26:17.264 --> 03:26:19.100
level that was slightly above

03:26:19.166 --> 03:26:22.903
but maybe visited a gas station

03:26:22.970 --> 03:26:25.106
five minutes ago and then maybe

03:26:25.172 --> 03:26:27.174
doesn't really correlate with

03:26:27.241 --> 03:26:30.911
what your exposure was that's

03:26:30.978 --> 03:26:31.512
why we told people don't get

03:26:31.579 --> 03:26:33.247
those kinds of tests they're

03:26:33.314 --> 03:26:36.884
not going to lead you to the.

03:26:36.951 --> 03:26:39.253
Have data to do randomized

03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:40.921
controlled sampling because you

03:26:40.988 --> 03:26:41.489
prevented physicians from

03:26:41.555 --> 03:26:43.257
collecting no that would not

03:26:43.324 --> 03:26:45.092
have been randomized right you

03:26:45.159 --> 03:26:45.726
just told me that it would need

03:26:45.793 --> 03:26:47.128
to be randomized but that would

03:26:47.194 --> 03:26:48.863
not been randomized Texas it

03:26:48.929 --> 03:26:49.497
could be randomized by setting

03:26:49.563 --> 03:26:51.198
up control groups outside of

03:26:51.265 --> 03:26:53.033
this community this community

03:26:53.100 --> 03:26:54.935
was exposed in such a way that

03:26:55.002 --> 03:26:55.536
the only way to set up that

03:26:55.603 --> 03:26:57.171
kind of comparison would be to

03:26:57.238 --> 03:26:59.039
people outside of the community

03:26:59.106 --> 03:26:59.707
who weren't having the exposure

03:26:59.774 --> 03:27:01.208
and that's why we have twenty

03:27:01.275 --> 03:27:01.809
five million would help study

03:27:01.876 --> 03:27:03.210
pending right which hasn't

03:27:03.277 --> 03:27:04.845
which hasn't started yet

03:27:04.912 --> 03:27:05.513
because now we're five years or

03:27:05.579 --> 03:27:07.214
five years after the fact. When

03:27:07.281 --> 03:27:09.083
I'm telling you that if you'd

03:27:09.150 --> 03:27:09.683
gotten those tests during the

03:27:09.750 --> 03:27:11.252
disaster in people to it I got

03:27:11.318 --> 03:27:13.454
faxes from doctors all over the

03:27:13.521 --> 03:27:15.289
all over the city who were

03:27:15.356 --> 03:27:17.224
emailing me and faxing those

03:27:17.291 --> 03:27:18.993
kinds of test results and the

03:27:19.059 --> 03:27:19.593
vast majority is test results

03:27:19.660 --> 03:27:27.067
were. Normal normal. Okay. No

03:27:27.134 --> 03:27:29.069
the vast majority went on ten

03:27:29.136 --> 03:27:29.670
the ones that were sent to me

03:27:29.737 --> 03:27:30.237
they were all normal. And I

03:27:30.304 --> 03:27:30.938
said you know what don't get

03:27:31.005 --> 03:27:31.472
these tests because were

03:27:31.539 --> 03:27:32.072
diagnosed these people with

03:27:32.139 --> 03:27:33.140
actual symptoms related to the

03:27:33.207 --> 03:27:35.075
actual exposure. You take that

03:27:35.142 --> 03:27:35.709
to someone and try to show them

03:27:35.776 --> 03:27:38.879
that you were exposed to toxic

03:27:38.946 --> 03:27:39.446
way. They're gonna take one

03:27:39.513 --> 03:27:40.047
look at those results and say

03:27:40.114 --> 03:27:42.883
no you weren't. All right well

03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:43.551
there are there are a number of

03:27:43.617 --> 03:27:45.152
people who disagree and I think

03:27:45.219 --> 03:27:45.786
the unfortunate result of this

03:27:45.853 --> 03:27:47.254
is that we weren't. Collecting

03:27:47.321 --> 03:27:49.023
sufficient data to now really

03:27:49.089 --> 03:27:50.891
do a robust an adequate health

03:27:50.958 --> 03:27:51.492
survey. For these people and

03:27:51.559 --> 03:27:53.227
what we know anecdotally of the

03:27:53.294 --> 03:27:55.029
blood borne illnesses in this

03:27:55.095 --> 03:27:55.563
community of respiratory

03:27:55.629 --> 03:27:59.033
illness. I hope that we get

03:27:59.099 --> 03:27:59.567
some conclusion from that

03:27:59.633 --> 03:28:01.168
health study that will commence

03:28:01.235 --> 03:28:03.037
but my other question for you

03:28:03.103 --> 03:28:03.671
is. Who will be conducting not

03:28:03.737 --> 03:28:07.107
health study. So the del city

03:28:07.174 --> 03:28:07.708
is going to be that the money

03:28:07.775 --> 03:28:11.111
was. Allocated to us and public

03:28:11.178 --> 03:28:12.913
health. Right now we're in the

03:28:12.980 --> 03:28:14.982
planning stages for that for

03:28:15.049 --> 03:28:17.051
that helps any. So we have a

03:28:17.117 --> 03:28:17.618
steering committee and we're

03:28:17.685 --> 03:28:19.186
developing essentially an

03:28:19.253 --> 03:28:19.720
infrastructure. For that

03:28:19.787 --> 03:28:21.255
committee. We are going to be

03:28:21.322 --> 03:28:23.324
convening a scientific panel an

03:28:23.390 --> 03:28:26.927
independent. Scientific panel.

03:28:26.994 --> 03:28:27.494
Experts from all over the

03:28:27.561 --> 03:28:29.296
country. In addition to some

03:28:29.363 --> 03:28:31.232
experts from some of our some

03:28:31.298 --> 03:28:33.000
of our top health agencies. And

03:28:33.067 --> 03:28:35.035
they together are going to be.

03:28:35.102 --> 03:28:37.171
Making the determinations about

03:28:37.238 --> 03:28:38.973
what the study goals are. And

03:28:39.039 --> 03:28:41.175
then they're going to be

03:28:41.242 --> 03:28:43.210
putting out wh. What we call

03:28:43.277 --> 03:28:47.047
request for proposals. Out from

03:28:47.114 --> 03:28:49.283
those who are out there

03:28:49.350 --> 03:28:51.285
researchers who are out there

03:28:51.352 --> 03:28:55.122
who would like to. Utilize our

03:28:55.189 --> 03:28:59.126
funds to perform to perform

03:28:59.193 --> 03:29:03.163
research of the proposals will

03:29:03.230 --> 03:29:09.036
come from. Outside researchers

03:29:09.103 --> 03:29:11.238
we anticipate the academic

03:29:11.305 --> 03:29:13.274
researchers from universities.

03:29:13.340 --> 03:29:15.142
Who would propose studies and

03:29:15.209 --> 03:29:17.044
then we would allocate funding

03:29:17.111 --> 03:29:17.645
than to them. To perform the

03:29:17.711 --> 03:29:19.446
studies. And how much longer

03:29:19.513 --> 03:29:21.315
will that take. So right now we

03:29:21.382 --> 03:29:21.882
are at least a we're in the

03:29:21.949 --> 03:29:27.054
planning. The timings. And the

03:29:27.121 --> 03:29:27.655
allocations that will then go

03:29:27.721 --> 03:29:31.091
out to researchers. I

03:29:31.158 --> 03:29:31.692
appreciate that there's going

03:29:31.759 --> 03:29:33.427
to be an independent body I

03:29:33.494 --> 03:29:35.195
hope that the community will

03:29:35.262 --> 03:29:35.763
continue to be sufficiently

03:29:35.829 --> 03:29:37.431
engage throughout the process

03:29:37.498 --> 03:29:39.099
but my one real concern is

03:29:39.166 --> 03:29:39.667
that. The timeliness of the

03:29:39.733 --> 03:29:43.504
data. Is what sets the urgency

03:29:43.570 --> 03:29:45.105
and what sets the validity of

03:29:45.172 --> 03:29:47.107
whatever comes out of a future

03:29:47.174 --> 03:29:47.708
health study and I don't think

03:29:47.775 --> 03:29:49.243
we did enough. To collect

03:29:49.310 --> 03:29:51.345
really good data in order to

03:29:51.412 --> 03:29:51.946
keep this community protected

03:29:52.012 --> 03:29:53.480
and protect the future of their

03:29:53.547 --> 03:29:55.149
health but I appreciate your

03:29:55.215 --> 03:29:57.251
answers here today. Without so

03:29:57.318 --> 03:30:01.055
cal gas cooperation how.

03:30:01.121 --> 03:30:01.689
Thorough do you think the study

03:30:01.755 --> 03:30:03.357
could be if they continue to

03:30:03.424 --> 03:30:05.059
not release their chemical

03:30:05.125 --> 03:30:07.361
background information what

03:30:07.428 --> 03:30:09.063
will you be able to ascertain

03:30:09.129 --> 03:30:11.165
based on samples that been

03:30:11.231 --> 03:30:11.732
collected in the community.

03:30:11.799 --> 03:30:13.400
What we're gonna need to get

03:30:13.467 --> 03:30:15.102
that info I think we just we

03:30:15.169 --> 03:30:15.703
have to take no for an answer

03:30:15.769 --> 03:30:16.303
the info that the so cal gas

03:30:16.370 --> 03:30:17.471
has not given us needs to be

03:30:17.538 --> 03:30:19.406
given to us and needs to be

03:30:19.473 --> 03:30:21.475
given to that scientific panel

03:30:21.542 --> 03:30:23.477
it needs to be given to the

03:30:23.544 --> 03:30:25.346
researchers. So I don't think

03:30:25.412 --> 03:30:29.316
that there's any. Reason to

03:30:29.383 --> 03:30:29.850
consider what we would do

03:30:29.917 --> 03:30:33.120
otherwise. Thank you thank you

03:30:33.187 --> 03:30:33.687
very much for your testimony

03:30:33.754 --> 03:30:34.288
I'm and now with an issue for

03:30:34.355 --> 03:30:41.428
her for me. Excuse me thank you

03:30:41.495 --> 03:30:42.029
deputy chief John taught Los

03:30:42.096 --> 03:30:43.464
Angeles county fire department

03:30:43.530 --> 03:30:43.964
I oversee the prevention

03:30:44.031 --> 03:30:47.267
services bureau. Like that

03:30:47.334 --> 03:30:49.336
thank center stern assembly

03:30:49.403 --> 03:30:49.870
person Smith role in this

03:30:49.937 --> 03:30:53.173
hearing today a locally I think

03:30:53.240 --> 03:30:53.774
it's important that the people

03:30:53.841 --> 03:30:55.542
be able to come testify in

03:30:55.609 --> 03:30:57.244
their own community about the

03:30:57.311 --> 03:30:59.179
impacts on this and it's- I've

03:30:59.246 --> 03:31:01.315
seen some of them in Sacramento

03:31:01.382 --> 03:31:01.849
but I know the hardship of

03:31:01.915 --> 03:31:03.183
getting up sacramental. So I

03:31:03.250 --> 03:31:05.386
just want to start out by

03:31:05.452 --> 03:31:07.221
saying. Along with Dr Rangan

03:31:07.287 --> 03:31:09.390
what he said in the beginning

03:31:09.456 --> 03:31:11.291
was the county. Los Angeles

03:31:11.358 --> 03:31:13.227
county in the city. Central

03:31:13.293 --> 03:31:13.794
city did want to see this

03:31:13.861 --> 03:31:15.529
facility re open. And we fought

03:31:15.596 --> 03:31:17.431
against that facility re

03:31:17.498 --> 03:31:19.233
opening we were. The initial

03:31:19.299 --> 03:31:21.235
group to file charges for the

03:31:21.301 --> 03:31:21.802
lack of notification of the

03:31:21.869 --> 03:31:25.339
leak. We went in may testimony

03:31:25.406 --> 03:31:27.174
in Sacramento about the

03:31:27.241 --> 03:31:29.243
earthquake the seismic issues

03:31:29.309 --> 03:31:31.345
we want to see the RCA complete

03:31:31.412 --> 03:31:35.115
before the facility re opened.

03:31:35.182 --> 03:31:35.682
We tried to file we filed an

03:31:35.749 --> 03:31:37.351
injunction in court to county

03:31:37.418 --> 03:31:39.319
did trying to stop the facility

03:31:39.386 --> 03:31:39.953
from the open when they started

03:31:40.020 --> 03:31:43.424
injecting. So we have been very

03:31:43.490 --> 03:31:45.626
active in that but as the fire

03:31:45.692 --> 03:31:47.461
department in its first respond

03:31:47.528 --> 03:31:49.363
or so. We needed to be able to

03:31:49.430 --> 03:31:51.398
improve the safety of the

03:31:51.465 --> 03:31:55.202
facility going forward. And

03:31:55.269 --> 03:31:55.836
that with our partners here in

03:31:55.903 --> 03:31:57.504
the city of Los Angeles because

03:31:57.571 --> 03:31:59.373
as most of you know. The Lisa

03:31:59.440 --> 03:32:03.177
canyon gas storage field is. In

03:32:03.243 --> 03:32:05.245
Los Angeles county and

03:32:05.312 --> 03:32:05.946
something we were to respond to

03:32:06.013 --> 03:32:07.181
the county fire department but

03:32:07.247 --> 03:32:09.183
Porter ranch is in the city. So

03:32:09.249 --> 03:32:11.285
it's a city of Los Angeles so

03:32:11.351 --> 03:32:11.819
they have their- city fire

03:32:11.885 --> 03:32:15.355
department here so we- both.

03:32:15.422 --> 03:32:17.458
Both agencies jointly work was

03:32:17.524 --> 03:32:19.126
so cal gas to try to prove

03:32:19.193 --> 03:32:21.128
their safety. And I will say

03:32:21.195 --> 03:32:23.730
before October twenty third two

03:32:23.797 --> 03:32:25.232
thousand fifteen we don't have

03:32:25.299 --> 03:32:25.799
a lot of knowledge about the

03:32:25.866 --> 03:32:27.568
facility. I got contacted early

03:32:27.634 --> 03:32:29.770
two thousands about a facility

03:32:29.837 --> 03:32:33.373
expansion. And I think one of

03:32:33.440 --> 03:32:34.007
our primary concern always up

03:32:34.074 --> 03:32:37.211
here this brush fires. And that

03:32:37.277 --> 03:32:37.678
was really it another

03:32:37.744 --> 03:32:38.212
experience I had with the

03:32:38.278 --> 03:32:39.513
facility and- in two thousand

03:32:39.580 --> 03:32:41.548
eight in the fall when the

03:32:41.615 --> 03:32:43.317
Cessna on fire. Came off a

03:32:43.383 --> 03:32:45.119
broken line off the facility

03:32:45.185 --> 03:32:47.287
and came down and- close the

03:32:47.354 --> 03:32:47.888
one eighteen freeway an impact

03:32:47.955 --> 03:32:49.256
to the community Porter ranch.

03:32:49.323 --> 03:32:51.658
We went to the public utilities

03:32:51.725 --> 03:32:53.393
commission after that and

03:32:53.460 --> 03:32:53.961
change some rules so that

03:32:54.027 --> 03:32:55.662
those. Lines that broke during

03:32:55.729 --> 03:32:57.464
that fire would be something

03:32:57.531 --> 03:32:58.031
under their purview because

03:32:58.098 --> 03:33:01.301
prior to that they weren't. Of

03:33:01.368 --> 03:33:03.370
course during the incident we

03:33:03.437 --> 03:33:04.004
learned a lot and we would do

03:33:04.071 --> 03:33:07.241
things differently next time I

03:33:07.307 --> 03:33:09.343
think we were all a little slow

03:33:09.409 --> 03:33:09.943
to respond to the seriousness

03:33:10.010 --> 03:33:13.313
of the event. I know I was up

03:33:13.380 --> 03:33:15.315
here a few days after the leak

03:33:15.382 --> 03:33:15.849
was discovered. I always

03:33:15.916 --> 03:33:17.417
thought that calling it a leak

03:33:17.484 --> 03:33:19.486
was a misnomer from the

03:33:19.553 --> 03:33:20.120
beginning because as you. Got

03:33:20.187 --> 03:33:23.590
close to it. It it sounded like

03:33:23.657 --> 03:33:24.224
a jet engine it didn't sound

03:33:24.291 --> 03:33:25.392
like a leak okay. It was

03:33:25.459 --> 03:33:27.594
tremendous pressure coming out

03:33:27.661 --> 03:33:29.396
of the ground there. I think

03:33:29.463 --> 03:33:31.665
early on we didn't you know I

03:33:31.732 --> 03:33:33.433
know we didn't we were

03:33:33.500 --> 03:33:35.269
providing advice to so cal gas

03:33:35.335 --> 03:33:37.337
public health was with us. But

03:33:37.404 --> 03:33:37.905
we didn't go into a unified

03:33:37.971 --> 03:33:39.540
command early on. And go if we

03:33:39.606 --> 03:33:41.608
had another incident like this

03:33:41.675 --> 03:33:43.277
that would be something we

03:33:43.343 --> 03:33:43.877
would do early where we could

03:33:43.944 --> 03:33:45.579
bring. More resources to bear

03:33:45.646 --> 03:33:49.449
more safety to bear. And move

03:33:49.516 --> 03:33:50.017
the gas company long maybe a

03:33:50.083 --> 03:33:53.487
little quicker. During the

03:33:53.554 --> 03:33:55.656
event. Again we work with

03:33:55.722 --> 03:33:57.558
public health but I think there

03:33:57.624 --> 03:33:59.626
was. Since then we've had other

03:33:59.693 --> 03:34:01.361
incidents where we've had to

03:34:01.428 --> 03:34:03.430
improve our messaging to the

03:34:03.497 --> 03:34:07.334
community to our bosses. To

03:34:07.401 --> 03:34:07.968
share the seriousness of these

03:34:08.035 --> 03:34:09.636
incidents we've had other well

03:34:09.703 --> 03:34:11.505
issues in playa del Rey. In

03:34:11.572 --> 03:34:13.440
other areas that were smaller.

03:34:13.507 --> 03:34:15.275
But let's just say everybody's

03:34:15.342 --> 03:34:17.377
concern is heightened after

03:34:17.444 --> 03:34:19.646
certainly this disaster relief

03:34:19.713 --> 03:34:21.682
so canyon. We do have a better

03:34:21.748 --> 03:34:23.550
understanding now of a well

03:34:23.617 --> 03:34:25.519
kill fluids in them were

03:34:25.586 --> 03:34:26.153
captains that's really doctor

03:34:26.220 --> 03:34:29.289
Rankin's area but we do need

03:34:29.356 --> 03:34:31.358
this assembly bill to pass to

03:34:31.425 --> 03:34:33.427
have them provide the gas

03:34:33.493 --> 03:34:35.362
company and other utilities to

03:34:35.429 --> 03:34:35.996
provide. Greater disclosures to

03:34:36.063 --> 03:34:39.499
us so we can help protect the

03:34:39.566 --> 03:34:40.100
community and we can give the

03:34:40.167 --> 03:34:45.439
community better advice. One of

03:34:45.505 --> 03:34:46.073
one of the challenges we found

03:34:46.139 --> 03:34:47.808
is we were working with so cal

03:34:47.874 --> 03:34:49.910
gas both fire departments they

03:34:49.977 --> 03:34:51.445
had this thing called a risk

03:34:51.511 --> 03:34:53.580
management plan. In in bed and

03:34:53.647 --> 03:34:55.482
it was an emergency response

03:34:55.549 --> 03:34:57.784
plan. But when I got a hold of

03:34:57.851 --> 03:34:59.419
the risk management plan it was

03:34:59.486 --> 03:35:01.455
like a phone book. It was a

03:35:01.521 --> 03:35:03.357
seven hundred page document in

03:35:03.423 --> 03:35:05.592
a big binder heavily redacted.

03:35:05.659 --> 03:35:09.396
So it was very. Useless to a

03:35:09.463 --> 03:35:10.030
first responder who was coming

03:35:10.097 --> 03:35:11.565
to the facility to respond to a

03:35:11.632 --> 03:35:13.333
brush fire some other disaster.

03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:15.469
So we put together an effort

03:35:15.535 --> 03:35:17.638
with. Was so cal gas to build a

03:35:17.704 --> 03:35:21.308
smaller first responder book

03:35:21.375 --> 03:35:21.908
they can be handed to every

03:35:21.975 --> 03:35:23.677
engine company that comes in.

03:35:23.744 --> 03:35:25.479
This is a confidential document

03:35:25.545 --> 03:35:27.714
that provides all the well

03:35:27.781 --> 03:35:29.316
locations all water locations.

03:35:29.383 --> 03:35:31.318
All the other locations where

03:35:31.385 --> 03:35:33.320
we can. Going to the facility

03:35:33.387 --> 03:35:35.589
and help with some kind of

03:35:35.656 --> 03:35:37.524
disaster. Typically our biggest

03:35:37.591 --> 03:35:39.326
concern here is gonna be fires

03:35:39.393 --> 03:35:41.795
and- a lot of times with these

03:35:41.862 --> 03:35:42.362
utilities they don't want

03:35:42.429 --> 03:35:45.432
disclosed storage areas maps

03:35:45.499 --> 03:35:47.668
the signage wasn't great. We

03:35:47.734 --> 03:35:49.803
always you know in the fire to

03:35:49.870 --> 03:35:51.538
the ice figure going to show up

03:35:51.605 --> 03:35:53.507
someplace at two in the morning

03:35:53.573 --> 03:35:54.107
it's going to be dark you're

03:35:54.174 --> 03:35:55.509
gonna be trying to find

03:35:55.575 --> 03:35:57.477
something. So the gas company

03:35:57.544 --> 03:35:59.446
work with us to put a lot more

03:35:59.513 --> 03:36:00.080
signage to put together this

03:36:00.147 --> 03:36:01.581
this map. To make radios

03:36:01.648 --> 03:36:03.850
available to make it so it's

03:36:03.917 --> 03:36:05.719
easier for us to respond to.

03:36:05.786 --> 03:36:09.423
And mitigate initial early and

03:36:09.489 --> 03:36:10.023
that's for the safety of the

03:36:10.090 --> 03:36:11.525
people who work here there's a

03:36:11.591 --> 03:36:12.159
lot of people who work on the

03:36:12.225 --> 03:36:14.027
hill it's for the safety of the

03:36:14.094 --> 03:36:15.762
public. And as we know with

03:36:15.829 --> 03:36:19.599
fires the sooner we get to a

03:36:19.666 --> 03:36:20.200
fire and start putting it out.

03:36:20.267 --> 03:36:23.470
Less threat there's going to be.

03:36:23.537 --> 03:36:24.037
Our other concerns of the

03:36:24.104 --> 03:36:25.639
facility of course remain

03:36:25.706 --> 03:36:26.239
earthquakes and I think. Our

03:36:26.306 --> 03:36:26.840
doctor from Northridge did an

03:36:26.907 --> 03:36:27.674
excellent job of explaining.

03:36:27.741 --> 03:36:29.943
The better than I could for

03:36:30.010 --> 03:36:31.411
sure better than I did in

03:36:31.478 --> 03:36:31.978
Sacramento. Hits a modern

03:36:32.045 --> 03:36:33.613
pictures and some modern

03:36:33.680 --> 03:36:35.615
displays. To show the amount of

03:36:35.682 --> 03:36:37.684
displacement. And I appreciate

03:36:37.751 --> 03:36:39.786
him. And the clarity that he

03:36:39.853 --> 03:36:41.722
brought about how many wells

03:36:41.788 --> 03:36:43.790
could be affected. Even the

03:36:43.857 --> 03:36:45.559
wells have been repaired. By an

03:36:45.625 --> 03:36:47.661
earthquake. So earthquakes

03:36:47.728 --> 03:36:49.930
remain a big a big challenge.

03:36:49.996 --> 03:36:51.932
And that Santa Susanna fault is

03:36:51.998 --> 03:36:53.867
there and as we know any of

03:36:53.934 --> 03:36:55.569
these faults. There's other

03:36:55.635 --> 03:36:56.069
faults that. May not be

03:36:56.136 --> 03:36:57.704
highlighted right now but

03:36:57.771 --> 03:36:59.773
they're there. So those are

03:36:59.840 --> 03:37:03.677
always a concern. Of course

03:37:03.744 --> 03:37:05.679
well failures and those kind of

03:37:05.746 --> 03:37:06.246
incidents like we've had I

03:37:06.313 --> 03:37:07.614
think there's been a lot of.

03:37:07.681 --> 03:37:09.783
Safety mechanism put in place

03:37:09.850 --> 03:37:11.485
and I've heard again and again.

03:37:11.551 --> 03:37:13.487
How this is now the safest gas

03:37:13.553 --> 03:37:14.121
storage Philip facility in the

03:37:14.187 --> 03:37:15.856
country. But I'm not here to

03:37:15.922 --> 03:37:17.824
represent so cal gas. I'm here

03:37:17.891 --> 03:37:19.760
to represent you and protect

03:37:19.826 --> 03:37:21.728
you in practice safety of the

03:37:21.795 --> 03:37:23.797
public. So that's great. I'm

03:37:23.864 --> 03:37:24.297
glad they're making the

03:37:24.364 --> 03:37:27.567
facility safer. There's two

03:37:27.634 --> 03:37:28.235
other facilities in the county

03:37:28.301 --> 03:37:31.471
of playa del Rey was mentioned.

03:37:31.538 --> 03:37:32.105
There's also one in Castaic at

03:37:32.172 --> 03:37:35.609
the on a ranch okay we develop

03:37:35.675 --> 03:37:36.243
simmer first responder maps for

03:37:36.309 --> 03:37:37.744
those facilities. And sometimes

03:37:37.811 --> 03:37:39.546
out of these disasters. It

03:37:39.613 --> 03:37:41.548
provides an opportunity for

03:37:41.615 --> 03:37:43.617
improved communication improve

03:37:43.683 --> 03:37:45.752
relationships. And I would say

03:37:45.819 --> 03:37:47.487
that our relationship and are

03:37:47.554 --> 03:37:48.088
working. Ability with the gas

03:37:48.155 --> 03:37:49.890
company has improved. We had a

03:37:49.956 --> 03:37:51.758
leak down applied rate in

03:37:51.825 --> 03:37:53.860
February it was in the street.

03:37:53.927 --> 03:37:57.531
It was a **** that was leaking.

03:37:57.597 --> 03:37:59.566
The day I was the weekend we

03:37:59.633 --> 03:38:01.501
have another problem with

03:38:01.568 --> 03:38:02.035
another well in playa the

03:38:02.102 --> 03:38:03.603
people were aware of. They

03:38:03.670 --> 03:38:05.906
don't want to repair the gas

03:38:05.972 --> 03:38:07.741
leak till Monday it was

03:38:07.808 --> 03:38:11.578
Superbowl Sunday. Bay they did

03:38:11.645 --> 03:38:13.613
put a crew on it and repair

03:38:13.680 --> 03:38:15.515
that leak on Sunday I don't

03:38:15.582 --> 03:38:16.183
think that would happen without

03:38:16.249 --> 03:38:18.018
a relationship in the pressure

03:38:18.084 --> 03:38:20.053
and like come on we have

03:38:20.120 --> 03:38:21.888
problems down there let's not

03:38:21.955 --> 03:38:23.723
wait till tomorrow. Okay so I'm

03:38:23.790 --> 03:38:25.725
not saying it's all perfect our

03:38:25.792 --> 03:38:27.727
relations improved we help them

03:38:27.794 --> 03:38:29.796
they helped us during the war

03:38:29.863 --> 03:38:31.798
the fire which was another

03:38:31.865 --> 03:38:33.700
major disaster within our-

03:38:33.767 --> 03:38:35.802
jurisdiction. It is you know I

03:38:35.869 --> 03:38:37.938
hear what you're saying about

03:38:38.004 --> 03:38:39.573
closing the facility. But for

03:38:39.639 --> 03:38:40.173
the time being it looks like

03:38:40.240 --> 03:38:41.775
the facility is going to be

03:38:41.842 --> 03:38:43.710
here and our job is a county

03:38:43.777 --> 03:38:44.311
fire department is your city

03:38:44.377 --> 03:38:45.979
fire department. Is to protect

03:38:46.046 --> 03:38:47.881
you and make it safe as

03:38:47.948 --> 03:38:49.883
possible and we will continue

03:38:49.950 --> 03:38:51.651
to work with so cal gas our

03:38:51.718 --> 03:38:53.854
legislators. Public health to

03:38:53.920 --> 03:38:55.922
try and do that and that's my-

03:38:55.989 --> 03:38:59.893
my promise to you. And I thank

03:38:59.960 --> 03:39:00.460
you for your tenants in this

03:39:00.527 --> 03:39:03.730
long hearing today. Thank you

03:39:03.797 --> 03:39:07.801
very much deputy chief. She

03:39:07.868 --> 03:39:08.335
taught could you walk me

03:39:08.401 --> 03:39:10.070
through since we know that the

03:39:10.136 --> 03:39:11.905
blow out commenced on October

03:39:11.972 --> 03:39:13.840
twenty third but the emergency

03:39:13.907 --> 03:39:15.876
declaration was not made until

03:39:15.942 --> 03:39:18.078
January six could you walk me

03:39:18.144 --> 03:39:19.813
through how your department was

03:39:19.880 --> 03:39:23.617
involved in the ramp up to the

03:39:23.683 --> 03:39:24.184
declaration of the emergency

03:39:24.251 --> 03:39:25.785
and why it took so long. Yes

03:39:25.852 --> 03:39:27.888
well initially the leak

03:39:27.954 --> 03:39:29.956
happened on the twenty third

03:39:30.023 --> 03:39:31.858
and we were informed for three

03:39:31.925 --> 03:39:32.425
days which was the immediate

03:39:32.492 --> 03:39:35.829
violation of our of our codes

03:39:35.896 --> 03:39:36.363
that they didn't notify us

03:39:36.429 --> 03:39:39.766
immediately about the release.

03:39:39.833 --> 03:39:40.333
This was a new challenge for

03:39:40.400 --> 03:39:43.670
us. And you know we've done

03:39:43.737 --> 03:39:45.739
brush fires we've done a lot of

03:39:45.805 --> 03:39:46.339
disasters a lot of different

03:39:46.406 --> 03:39:47.874
things but we had not responded

03:39:47.941 --> 03:39:49.576
to a gas leak of this magnitude.

03:39:49.643 --> 03:39:53.547
And well. And they had fire

03:39:53.613 --> 03:39:55.649
people here and the immediate

03:39:55.715 --> 03:39:57.551
concern was to try and kill.

03:39:57.617 --> 03:40:00.020
The leak. And as you heard

03:40:00.086 --> 03:40:01.888
there was half dozen attempts.

03:40:01.955 --> 03:40:03.990
And everyone they thought was

03:40:04.057 --> 03:40:07.727
gonna effectively. Stop it but

03:40:07.794 --> 03:40:09.863
of course it did not and things

03:40:09.930 --> 03:40:11.965
got worse the whole got

03:40:12.032 --> 03:40:13.967
destabilized and is going

03:40:14.034 --> 03:40:16.102
through my notes for this talk

03:40:16.169 --> 03:40:18.138
it reminded me to looking

03:40:18.204 --> 03:40:18.738
through the news clippings and

03:40:18.805 --> 03:40:21.808
stuff. That the governor did

03:40:21.875 --> 03:40:22.442
not clear that disaster till

03:40:22.509 --> 03:40:25.779
January of two thousand sixteen.

03:40:25.845 --> 03:40:28.114
So it it it it pointed to it

03:40:28.181 --> 03:40:30.116
reminded me of the slowness of

03:40:30.183 --> 03:40:32.052
everybody's kind of response to

03:40:32.118 --> 03:40:34.120
this these people are feeling

03:40:34.187 --> 03:40:35.989
the direct results. But we were

03:40:36.056 --> 03:40:39.693
providing advice the state came

03:40:39.759 --> 03:40:40.260
down hello yes was here the

03:40:40.327 --> 03:40:42.062
governor's office of emergency

03:40:42.128 --> 03:40:44.164
services. They were negotiating

03:40:44.230 --> 03:40:45.932
with the fire chief. They were

03:40:45.999 --> 03:40:47.934
talking about well you want to

03:40:48.001 --> 03:40:49.903
going to command was so cal gas

03:40:49.970 --> 03:40:52.005
at the time we didn't feel like

03:40:52.072 --> 03:40:53.974
it was our incident we felt

03:40:54.040 --> 03:40:55.675
like it was so cal gas is

03:40:55.742 --> 03:40:57.677
incident. So there was some

03:40:57.744 --> 03:40:59.679
political discussions going on

03:40:59.746 --> 03:41:00.280
at the board and at the state

03:41:00.347 --> 03:41:03.850
level and the state wanted us

03:41:03.917 --> 03:41:07.754
to inject ourselves and so we

03:41:07.821 --> 03:41:11.691
kept inviting advisors and

03:41:11.758 --> 03:41:13.693
inviting more and more staff

03:41:13.760 --> 03:41:14.361
but it came to a point where we

03:41:14.427 --> 03:41:16.062
actually as we do on many of

03:41:16.129 --> 03:41:17.964
these big fires are many

03:41:18.031 --> 03:41:19.866
disasters. We going to unify

03:41:19.933 --> 03:41:22.135
command where we have an equal

03:41:22.202 --> 03:41:25.705
partnership in mitigating

03:41:25.772 --> 03:41:29.776
whatever it is and so and

03:41:29.843 --> 03:41:33.713
that's when I go back to I

03:41:33.780 --> 03:41:35.882
think something like this

03:41:35.949 --> 03:41:39.719
happen again unified command

03:41:39.786 --> 03:41:41.788
would happen immediately. But

03:41:41.855 --> 03:41:46.026
in this case it took some time

03:41:46.092 --> 03:41:47.861
and I think it was just a

03:41:47.927 --> 03:41:48.428
matter of understanding the

03:41:48.495 --> 03:41:49.729
scope of the disaster and-

03:41:49.796 --> 03:41:51.765
learning as we went. And I

03:41:51.831 --> 03:41:52.399
apologize for that I think we

03:41:52.465 --> 03:41:53.733
should have done more earlier

03:41:53.800 --> 03:41:54.300
but it was a challenging new

03:41:54.367 --> 03:42:00.006
situation for us. Accessing the

03:42:00.073 --> 03:42:01.808
most up to date information we

03:42:01.875 --> 03:42:02.375
know that during you know

03:42:02.442 --> 03:42:03.943
wildfires or other emergencies

03:42:04.010 --> 03:42:04.611
we ask people to rely on Nick's

03:42:04.678 --> 03:42:06.246
a lawyer official. On social

03:42:06.312 --> 03:42:09.749
media sites how would you plan

03:42:09.816 --> 03:42:10.283
on communicating with the

03:42:10.350 --> 03:42:10.884
community where this to happen

03:42:10.950 --> 03:42:15.955
again. Well weaver. My guess it

03:42:16.022 --> 03:42:16.489
had some other incidents

03:42:16.556 --> 03:42:18.224
smaller incidents with oil and

03:42:18.291 --> 03:42:20.060
gas wells. And we've developed

03:42:20.126 --> 03:42:23.997
a- a system where we have an

03:42:24.064 --> 03:42:25.732
office of emergency management

03:42:25.799 --> 03:42:26.332
the county. Our partners of

03:42:26.399 --> 03:42:28.101
public health in the board

03:42:28.168 --> 03:42:30.203
offices. Where where we've

03:42:30.270 --> 03:42:32.038
developed like levels kind of

03:42:32.105 --> 03:42:33.740
like you have like in homeland

03:42:33.807 --> 03:42:36.109
security level one two three.

03:42:36.176 --> 03:42:36.676
And then depending on the

03:42:36.743 --> 03:42:40.013
severity of whatever the issue

03:42:40.080 --> 03:42:41.915
is then we push out

03:42:41.981 --> 03:42:43.983
notifications. The example in

03:42:44.050 --> 03:42:45.752
the marina back in January. Was

03:42:45.819 --> 03:42:47.854
a single well. That was being

03:42:47.921 --> 03:42:49.923
re abandon. And on a Friday

03:42:49.989 --> 03:42:52.092
afternoon. It's a there was a

03:42:52.158 --> 03:42:53.993
gas release and some air

03:42:54.060 --> 03:42:55.929
pressure and a bunch of sand.

03:42:55.995 --> 03:42:57.931
It's sharp a geyser of seventy

03:42:57.997 --> 03:43:00.033
eight feet. But it was a one

03:43:00.100 --> 03:43:02.001
time event and it was done. And

03:43:02.068 --> 03:43:05.905
it took several weeks to

03:43:05.972 --> 03:43:06.539
actually kill about well in re

03:43:06.606 --> 03:43:08.208
abandon that well. But out of

03:43:08.274 --> 03:43:10.276
that. There was concerns about

03:43:10.343 --> 03:43:12.011
the level of communication even

03:43:12.078 --> 03:43:13.847
from the single little.

03:43:13.913 --> 03:43:15.915
Basically Burke from this well

03:43:15.982 --> 03:43:16.483
so we all got together as a

03:43:16.549 --> 03:43:19.953
team Mr blown OEM fire

03:43:20.019 --> 03:43:21.855
department our board offices.

03:43:21.921 --> 03:43:27.894
To put together. A notification.

03:43:27.961 --> 03:43:28.495
System so we can get the word

03:43:28.561 --> 03:43:33.967
out to the public sooner. Say

03:43:34.033 --> 03:43:34.601
that thank you and as a part of

03:43:34.667 --> 03:43:35.969
the espy thirty requires that

03:43:36.035 --> 03:43:36.603
the facility developed a safety

03:43:36.669 --> 03:43:37.971
plan. Going forward I I'm

03:43:38.037 --> 03:43:38.571
curious as the department or

03:43:38.638 --> 03:43:40.206
office of emergency services

03:43:40.273 --> 03:43:42.175
been invited to participate in

03:43:42.242 --> 03:43:42.675
the development of that

03:43:42.742 --> 03:43:46.079
emergency plan. So I think it

03:43:46.146 --> 03:43:46.646
was mentioned earlier today

03:43:46.713 --> 03:43:48.114
this story integrity and

03:43:48.181 --> 03:43:48.681
storage integrity management

03:43:48.748 --> 03:43:52.218
plan. We've had regular

03:43:52.285 --> 03:43:54.020
meetings with so cal gas and

03:43:54.087 --> 03:43:55.989
they've invited us they've that

03:43:56.055 --> 03:43:57.891
we review that document with us

03:43:57.957 --> 03:43:58.491
they've invited us to comment

03:43:58.558 --> 03:44:02.061
on it. It's some it's technical

03:44:02.128 --> 03:44:02.729
it's you're you're dealing with

03:44:02.796 --> 03:44:04.297
a lot of. Process is here and I

03:44:04.364 --> 03:44:07.967
think sometimes. If this

03:44:08.034 --> 03:44:08.468
facility because it's so

03:44:08.535 --> 03:44:10.236
hidden. A lot of people don't

03:44:10.303 --> 03:44:13.873
realize. The pressures in the

03:44:13.940 --> 03:44:15.942
in the amount of heat and of

03:44:16.009 --> 03:44:16.509
fluids and things that are

03:44:16.576 --> 03:44:18.178
going on when you see a

03:44:18.244 --> 03:44:19.879
refinery aside the freeway

03:44:19.946 --> 03:44:22.182
somewhere. You can say well

03:44:22.248 --> 03:44:22.816
refinery it's right there I can

03:44:22.882 --> 03:44:24.150
see all the- all the all the

03:44:24.217 --> 03:44:26.252
process is there going on the

03:44:26.319 --> 03:44:28.321
cracking of chemicals and so

03:44:28.388 --> 03:44:29.956
forth. But this facility the

03:44:30.023 --> 03:44:30.623
way it kind of goes up over the

03:44:30.690 --> 03:44:33.893
hill this kind of hidden. And

03:44:33.960 --> 03:44:36.262
it it it people are less aware

03:44:36.329 --> 03:44:36.863
of the of the hazards that are

03:44:36.930 --> 03:44:40.166
there. Is there any plan once

03:44:40.233 --> 03:44:42.135
the safety plan is developed or

03:44:42.202 --> 03:44:42.602
whatever measures the

03:44:42.669 --> 03:44:44.204
department has decided to take.

03:44:44.270 --> 03:44:45.972
To have a meeting with the

03:44:46.039 --> 03:44:46.539
community to reassure them

03:44:46.606 --> 03:44:48.508
about in the event that this

03:44:48.575 --> 03:44:50.076
were to happen again what that

03:44:50.143 --> 03:44:50.677
process would look like in

03:44:50.743 --> 03:44:53.947
terms of an evacuation or- you

03:44:54.013 --> 03:44:54.547
know using. Respirators or or

03:44:54.614 --> 03:44:55.081
equipment to protect their

03:44:55.148 --> 03:45:00.053
health. That's an excellent

03:45:00.119 --> 03:45:00.687
idea we don't have that plant

03:45:00.753 --> 03:45:02.322
currently but that would

03:45:02.388 --> 03:45:02.856
probably be an excellent

03:45:02.922 --> 03:45:04.424
followup to idea to have. Some

03:45:04.490 --> 03:45:06.326
of the county family in the

03:45:06.392 --> 03:45:08.294
city. Of folks from Los Angeles

03:45:08.361 --> 03:45:10.330
city talk to the community

03:45:10.396 --> 03:45:10.930
about what we do. In case of a

03:45:10.997 --> 03:45:16.236
future event. And you know per

03:45:16.302 --> 03:45:19.973
I've our our friend from cal

03:45:20.039 --> 03:45:20.473
state Northridge in his

03:45:20.540 --> 03:45:22.108
presentation on and- the

03:45:22.175 --> 03:45:24.310
seismic risk for this facility

03:45:24.377 --> 03:45:25.912
I would assume that something

03:45:25.979 --> 03:45:26.546
that your department is very.

03:45:26.613 --> 03:45:28.414
Concerned with as well because

03:45:28.481 --> 03:45:30.016
we're we to have it a sizeable.

03:45:30.083 --> 03:45:31.918
Earthquake again in this

03:45:31.985 --> 03:45:32.518
community your resources are

03:45:32.585 --> 03:45:34.153
going to be stretched fairly

03:45:34.220 --> 03:45:36.089
thin. Is the plan that's in

03:45:36.155 --> 03:45:38.224
place have any mitigation

03:45:38.291 --> 03:45:42.161
consideration to a seismic

03:45:42.228 --> 03:45:42.695
event what would occur for

03:45:42.762 --> 03:45:46.432
response. Yeah I you know I'd

03:45:46.499 --> 03:45:48.067
have to look more at that I I'd

03:45:48.134 --> 03:45:48.668
have to look more to seismic

03:45:48.735 --> 03:45:50.503
end of things. I know we're

03:45:50.570 --> 03:45:54.140
concerned about seismic I don't

03:45:54.207 --> 03:45:56.175
think we planned for. You know

03:45:56.242 --> 03:45:58.211
sixty wells failing and how

03:45:58.278 --> 03:45:58.711
that would. How we would

03:45:58.778 --> 03:46:02.382
mitigate that. You know I think

03:46:02.448 --> 03:46:02.949
there's more work to be done

03:46:03.016 --> 03:46:12.125
there. Right I appreciate your

03:46:12.191 --> 03:46:12.759
German for your testimony thank

03:46:12.825 --> 03:46:16.195
you very much you know I will

03:46:16.262 --> 03:46:16.796
say and I'm glad that we did

03:46:16.863 --> 03:46:20.033
get to the emergency response.

03:46:20.099 --> 03:46:20.700
And the health response because

03:46:20.767 --> 03:46:22.368
that was at the heart. Of what

03:46:22.435 --> 03:46:24.203
this community is still

03:46:24.270 --> 03:46:26.239
suffering with. The health

03:46:26.306 --> 03:46:28.207
effects are there the losses

03:46:28.274 --> 03:46:30.109
the real losses of human life

03:46:30.176 --> 03:46:32.245
or their diagnoses that may may

03:46:32.312 --> 03:46:34.414
or may not be related but we

03:46:34.480 --> 03:46:36.549
may never know because we don't

03:46:36.616 --> 03:46:38.117
have a sufficient data set that

03:46:38.184 --> 03:46:40.019
was started from the onset. Of

03:46:40.086 --> 03:46:42.088
the blow out it's important for

03:46:42.155 --> 03:46:42.655
us to look at all of those

03:46:42.722 --> 03:46:44.457
factors going forward in

03:46:44.524 --> 03:46:46.359
keeping this community safe and

03:46:46.426 --> 03:46:48.461
the other part of the community

03:46:48.528 --> 03:46:50.296
that I represent which is where

03:46:50.363 --> 03:46:58.171
the honor Rancho gas storage

03:46:58.237 --> 03:47:02.175
facility is I have two of

03:47:02.241 --> 03:47:06.045
these. In my legislative

03:47:06.112 --> 03:47:08.381
district and I'll be darned if

03:47:08.448 --> 03:47:10.516
we go through this again and

03:47:10.583 --> 03:47:12.385
have it on people in exactly

03:47:12.452 --> 03:47:14.487
this way so I appreciate that

03:47:14.554 --> 03:47:16.055
senator stern is on the same

03:47:16.122 --> 03:47:18.358
page with me and making sure

03:47:18.424 --> 03:47:22.061
that we have. On covered every

03:47:22.128 --> 03:47:30.269
possible area where. Your rank

03:47:30.336 --> 03:47:34.240
and file were. Exposed in going

03:47:34.307 --> 03:47:36.342
through still the same

03:47:36.409 --> 03:47:38.444
suffering that this community

03:47:38.511 --> 03:47:40.413
is as well so we'll be standing

03:47:40.480 --> 03:47:44.083
shoulder to shoulder with them

03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:46.152
and we believe there is

03:47:46.219 --> 03:47:48.187
sufficient discretion to go

03:47:48.254 --> 03:47:50.089
obtain a lot of the public

03:47:50.156 --> 03:47:52.091
health information that is

03:47:52.158 --> 03:47:54.227
already being requested I'm in

03:47:54.293 --> 03:47:56.429
the follow up to. Our letter to

03:47:56.496 --> 03:47:58.564
the CEO of the gas company you

03:47:58.631 --> 03:48:00.333
can be sure that'll be a

03:48:00.400 --> 03:48:02.368
component of it but as I

03:48:02.435 --> 03:48:04.203
mentioned earlier I think

03:48:04.270 --> 03:48:06.572
nothing works like the force of

03:48:06.639 --> 03:48:08.441
law and so will be looking to

03:48:08.508 --> 03:48:10.276
support from this

03:48:10.343 --> 03:48:12.412
administration frankly in

03:48:12.478 --> 03:48:16.315
working with the county. And

03:48:16.382 --> 03:48:18.384
some of our partners to help us

03:48:18.451 --> 03:48:22.155
get some legislation through so

03:48:22.221 --> 03:48:22.722
that. We have access to the

03:48:22.789 --> 03:48:24.590
kind of. What they'll call

03:48:24.657 --> 03:48:28.428
trade secret chemicals although

03:48:28.494 --> 03:48:28.995
we went through this with

03:48:29.062 --> 03:48:30.229
fracking and they said. If you

03:48:30.296 --> 03:48:32.198
disclose these chemicals will

03:48:32.265 --> 03:48:34.100
leave the state of California

03:48:34.167 --> 03:48:34.767
because everyone will know what

03:48:34.834 --> 03:48:36.436
we're injecting underground.

03:48:36.502 --> 03:48:38.304
And you know if they can

03:48:38.371 --> 03:48:38.938
operate transparently then they

03:48:39.005 --> 03:48:44.510
should leave. But the fact that

03:48:44.577 --> 03:48:46.412
this is still an old oil field.

03:48:46.479 --> 03:48:52.251
And that there is still benzene

03:48:52.318 --> 03:48:54.120
and other chemicals still down

03:48:54.187 --> 03:48:56.355
there and- wells like ward

03:48:56.422 --> 03:49:00.193
three you're still problematic.

03:49:00.259 --> 03:49:00.793
And that we frankly put the

03:49:00.860 --> 03:49:02.728
card way before the horse here

03:49:02.795 --> 03:49:04.397
and re opening that field

03:49:04.464 --> 03:49:04.997
before we knew the answers to

03:49:05.064 --> 03:49:08.434
all these questions. Is still

03:49:08.501 --> 03:49:09.035
an unacceptable decision that

03:49:09.102 --> 03:49:12.538
we have to just. We're living

03:49:12.605 --> 03:49:14.540
with right now and IT I wish we

03:49:14.607 --> 03:49:16.542
would've had got that bill off

03:49:16.609 --> 03:49:18.478
the floor that you help with

03:49:18.544 --> 03:49:19.078
deputy chief Todd we were one

03:49:19.145 --> 03:49:24.217
vote short. And shame on those

03:49:24.283 --> 03:49:26.219
colleagues who didn't support

03:49:26.285 --> 03:49:28.421
that legislation but will need

03:49:28.488 --> 03:49:30.423
to echo far beyond this room.

03:49:30.490 --> 03:49:32.291
Especially in subsequent

03:49:32.358 --> 03:49:34.227
statutory follow but will

03:49:34.293 --> 03:49:34.760
really be looking to the

03:49:34.827 --> 03:49:36.229
governor and his administration

03:49:36.295 --> 03:49:38.531
to help us make sure that there

03:49:38.598 --> 03:49:40.366
is a comprehensive emergency

03:49:40.433 --> 03:49:42.435
response plan in place. That

03:49:42.502 --> 03:49:44.537
this public health information

03:49:44.604 --> 03:49:46.439
there is no excuse anymore from

03:49:46.506 --> 03:49:48.407
I get from the gas company or

03:49:48.474 --> 03:49:50.610
any others. To disclose that

03:49:50.676 --> 03:49:52.345
kind of information we saw the

03:49:52.411 --> 03:49:52.912
same thing happened frankly

03:49:52.979 --> 03:49:54.547
after Wolsey fire. And a lot of

03:49:54.614 --> 03:50:00.386
the same the. Hoped public

03:50:00.453 --> 03:50:02.221
health data that still concerns

03:50:02.288 --> 03:50:04.524
me to this day so you can

03:50:04.590 --> 03:50:05.057
guarantee a response in

03:50:05.124 --> 03:50:08.227
Sacramento. In the weeks ahead

03:50:08.294 --> 03:50:10.496
we only have about. A month

03:50:10.563 --> 03:50:12.298
left of session will go back on

03:50:12.365 --> 03:50:14.567
August twelfth. But in these

03:50:14.634 --> 03:50:18.404
remaining for weeks. I think

03:50:18.471 --> 03:50:20.840
you can rest assured that this

03:50:20.907 --> 03:50:24.277
family member Smith myself. And

03:50:24.343 --> 03:50:24.810
what I'm hearing today is

03:50:24.877 --> 03:50:26.712
hopefully this administration

03:50:26.779 --> 03:50:28.481
as well will help us put a

03:50:28.548 --> 03:50:30.650
package together to have. Some

03:50:30.716 --> 03:50:32.418
kind of way to fill the gaps.

03:50:32.485 --> 03:50:34.387
To get dog the mission

03:50:34.453 --> 03:50:36.355
alignment they need to get them

03:50:36.422 --> 03:50:40.526
the data they need. To get

03:50:40.593 --> 03:50:42.628
those regulations in a place

03:50:42.695 --> 03:50:44.630
that aren't just good enough

03:50:44.697 --> 03:50:46.632
but and aren't even just the

03:50:46.699 --> 03:50:48.668
gold standard but to actually

03:50:48.734 --> 03:50:50.503
start to transition what that

03:50:50.570 --> 03:50:52.605
is but will need your your help

03:50:52.672 --> 03:50:54.473
in that regard. And we'll be

03:50:54.540 --> 03:50:56.409
looking to supervisor Barker

03:50:56.475 --> 03:50:58.511
and the LA County Board in that

03:50:58.578 --> 03:50:59.111
regard as well as all the city

03:50:59.178 --> 03:51:00.713
council and gas company may

03:51:00.780 --> 03:51:02.682
have some problems with that.

03:51:02.748 --> 03:51:04.584
And we know that they have a

03:51:04.650 --> 03:51:06.519
lot of political power but this

03:51:06.586 --> 03:51:08.487
isn't an exercise in politics

03:51:08.554 --> 03:51:12.625
this is an exercise in morality

03:51:12.692 --> 03:51:20.433
so thank you for coming here.

03:51:20.499 --> 03:51:24.370
So I'm I think at this point.

03:51:24.437 --> 03:51:24.904
Unless there are any final

03:51:24.971 --> 03:51:26.772
comments from the public I know

03:51:26.839 --> 03:51:28.474
we've been pretty thorough and

03:51:28.541 --> 03:51:30.509
we went a very long time I'd

03:51:30.576 --> 03:51:32.411
like to invite one last

03:51:32.478 --> 03:51:33.045
opportunity for public comment

03:51:33.112 --> 03:51:34.647
here I see a few other

03:51:34.714 --> 03:51:38.551
individuals so. Just to for the

03:51:38.618 --> 03:51:40.353
sake of protocol here let's

03:51:40.419 --> 03:51:42.455
let's so let's open this back

03:51:42.521 --> 03:51:44.523
up to public comment and then

03:51:44.590 --> 03:51:45.124
we'll we'll go with closing

03:51:45.191 --> 03:51:46.759
remarks but if I would ask if

03:51:46.826 --> 03:51:48.628
you've already spoken during

03:51:48.694 --> 03:51:50.696
public comment period to

03:51:50.763 --> 03:51:54.400
respond back in writing I

03:51:54.467 --> 03:51:54.967
promise you this committee

03:51:55.034 --> 03:51:58.437
these committees will we'll be

03:51:58.504 --> 03:51:59.038

03:51:59.105 --> 03:52:00.806
and be looking at a report

03:52:00.873 --> 03:52:02.742

03:52:13.052 --> 03:52:16.555
cooperation and thank you again

03:52:16.622 --> 03:52:18.491

03:52:18.557 --> 03:52:20.359
county your independent experts

03:52:20.426 --> 03:52:24.397
for coming. And welcome yes Sir.

03:52:24.463 --> 03:52:26.799
Thank you. My name's you sound

03:52:26.866 --> 03:52:28.501
as Jim I'm the president of the

03:52:28.567 --> 03:52:30.536
poorest neighborhood council.

03:52:30.603 --> 03:52:31.103
Before I get home and we're

03:52:31.170 --> 03:52:32.838
gonna ask is folks if folks who

03:52:32.905 --> 03:52:34.974
just keep it down during his

03:52:35.041 --> 03:52:36.542
final public comment period we

03:52:36.609 --> 03:52:38.511
do appreciate. Your cooperation

03:52:38.577 --> 03:52:40.379
thank you. I do want to say

03:52:40.446 --> 03:52:40.980
before I put my comment is I

03:52:41.047 --> 03:52:44.650
forgot to thank LAUSD. For the

03:52:44.717 --> 03:52:46.652
effort they did to host us in

03:52:46.719 --> 03:52:48.821
this room here so guys in the

03:52:48.888 --> 03:52:50.823
back thank you very much yeah

03:52:50.890 --> 03:52:54.393
for all the work and for the-

03:52:54.460 --> 03:52:54.994
administration of thing cool.

03:52:55.061 --> 03:52:56.662
That allow this. Senator some

03:52:56.729 --> 03:52:58.731
remember thank you very much

03:52:58.798 --> 03:52:59.332
you have no idea how grateful

03:52:59.398 --> 03:53:04.770
we are. I want to save a few

03:53:04.837 --> 03:53:08.808
comments one is. We need you to

03:53:08.874 --> 03:53:10.776
understand this issue is a

03:53:10.843 --> 03:53:14.747
binary issue for us. We either

03:53:14.814 --> 03:53:16.716
miserably failed. And this

03:53:16.782 --> 03:53:20.519
facility stays open. Or we

03:53:20.586 --> 03:53:24.423
succeed in this facility close.

03:53:24.490 --> 03:53:26.592
There is no middle ground to

03:53:26.659 --> 03:53:28.794
this question I appreciate the

03:53:28.861 --> 03:53:30.763
counties need to have

03:53:30.830 --> 03:53:32.798
procedures in place because

03:53:32.865 --> 03:53:34.667
they cover a lot bigger a

03:53:34.734 --> 03:53:38.738
domain I respect that domain

03:53:38.804 --> 03:53:40.639
for this community. This is not

03:53:40.706 --> 03:53:42.875
a compromise discussion this is

03:53:42.942 --> 03:53:45.010
in either yes or no and nothing

03:53:45.077 --> 03:53:48.814
in between. You heard it from

03:53:48.881 --> 03:53:50.716
the community and this is the

03:53:50.783 --> 03:53:52.885
absolute position that the

03:53:52.952 --> 03:53:54.587
neighborhood council has taken

03:53:54.653 --> 03:53:56.655
and as you know we have been

03:53:56.722 --> 03:53:58.791
advocating for that closure as

03:53:58.858 --> 03:54:00.793
we go along. And there are two

03:54:00.860 --> 03:54:02.895
reasons for that position and

03:54:02.962 --> 03:54:04.597
for it being too at very

03:54:04.663 --> 03:54:06.866
adamant the two reasons have

03:54:06.932 --> 03:54:07.500
been mentioned today but I want

03:54:07.566 --> 03:54:10.636
to highlight. The first one is

03:54:10.703 --> 03:54:11.270
the fact that over four months

03:54:11.337 --> 03:54:16.509
of exposure. When the gas

03:54:16.575 --> 03:54:17.109
company knew exactly what was

03:54:17.176 --> 03:54:20.613
coming out of the field. They

03:54:20.679 --> 03:54:22.615
never told me they never told

03:54:22.681 --> 03:54:24.717
you they never told anybody in

03:54:24.784 --> 03:54:26.719
this room you heard it from the

03:54:26.786 --> 03:54:28.587
county which sort of mention it

03:54:28.654 --> 03:54:30.656
as a comment as we move on we

03:54:30.723 --> 03:54:32.491
need to stop at that comment.

03:54:32.558 --> 03:54:34.660
And recognize that there are

03:54:34.727 --> 03:54:36.629
certain things that are not

03:54:36.695 --> 03:54:38.831
acceptable and certain things

03:54:38.898 --> 03:54:40.599
that cannot be forgiven. From

03:54:40.666 --> 03:54:42.635
my perspective on the

03:54:42.701 --> 03:54:43.169
perspective neighborhood

03:54:43.235 --> 03:54:45.070
council that is where we draw

03:54:45.137 --> 03:54:46.906
the line. Because they can play

03:54:46.972 --> 03:54:48.707
Russian roulette with their

03:54:48.774 --> 03:54:50.609
children. Don't play it with

03:54:50.676 --> 03:54:52.545
ours and that's the bottom line.

03:54:52.611 --> 03:54:56.749
So. I have no idea what I

03:54:56.816 --> 03:54:57.349
expose my children too. And I

03:54:57.416 --> 03:55:02.588
will never know. And I have to

03:55:02.655 --> 03:55:03.088
move on from there and

03:55:03.155 --> 03:55:04.690
personally I have moved on from

03:55:04.757 --> 03:55:06.525
there that's why my goal is

03:55:06.592 --> 03:55:07.193
about a future issue not a past

03:55:07.259 --> 03:55:10.863
issue. So they have lost the

03:55:10.930 --> 03:55:12.832
moral right to be a neighbor.

03:55:12.898 --> 03:55:14.767
By their deception. And that is

03:55:14.834 --> 03:55:20.873
very clear to us. The second

03:55:20.940 --> 03:55:22.575
issue is the seismic failure.

03:55:22.641 --> 03:55:25.010
Now in this world that we live

03:55:25.077 --> 03:55:28.581
in there is no zero risk I

03:55:28.647 --> 03:55:30.850
respect that everything we do

03:55:30.916 --> 03:55:32.585
has a risk associated with it.

03:55:32.651 --> 03:55:34.920
But in my long straw inside

03:55:34.987 --> 03:55:36.856
another mile long straw. Has a

03:55:36.922 --> 03:55:40.593
significant risk of rupture in

03:55:40.659 --> 03:55:42.695
a seismic event there is

03:55:42.761 --> 03:55:46.699
nothing you can do to increase

03:55:46.765 --> 03:55:47.266
the size make strength of a

03:55:47.333 --> 03:55:50.703
straw like that. So. It comes

03:55:50.769 --> 03:55:52.872
down to what does the state C.

03:55:52.938 --> 03:55:54.907
as acceptable risk and what

03:55:54.974 --> 03:55:56.842
they don't see is acceptable

03:55:56.909 --> 03:55:59.011
risk that's what they're trying

03:55:59.078 --> 03:56:02.548
to define the problem for us

03:56:02.615 --> 03:56:03.148
is. This is not an acceptable

03:56:03.215 --> 03:56:06.685
risk. Whichever way you die sit

03:56:06.752 --> 03:56:08.654
and slice it this cannot be an

03:56:08.721 --> 03:56:09.255
acceptable risk for community

03:56:09.321 --> 03:56:12.658
and I'll tell you why. The

03:56:12.725 --> 03:56:13.158
chief was talking about

03:56:13.225 --> 03:56:14.693
emergency preparedness and

03:56:14.760 --> 03:56:16.695
thank you for that question. I

03:56:16.762 --> 03:56:17.296
will tell you the first thing

03:56:17.363 --> 03:56:20.766
that the city is putting in our

03:56:20.833 --> 03:56:21.233
heads in preparing for

03:56:21.300 --> 03:56:22.735
earthquakes is what. Have

03:56:22.801 --> 03:56:24.870
enough supplies to be on your

03:56:24.937 --> 03:56:26.872
own for at least. Four to five

03:56:26.939 --> 03:56:30.709
days because in a true seismic

03:56:30.776 --> 03:56:32.778
event there is not enough

03:56:32.845 --> 03:56:34.813
emergency. Responders to go to

03:56:34.880 --> 03:56:38.651
homes and deal with people. Now

03:56:38.717 --> 03:56:40.920
you can plan all you want when

03:56:40.986 --> 03:56:42.721
you are in a position where you

03:56:42.788 --> 03:56:43.355
say I do not have enough to

03:56:43.422 --> 03:56:45.057
come to people's homes in a

03:56:45.124 --> 03:56:48.727
significant seismic event. And

03:56:48.794 --> 03:56:50.729
put on top of that if a silly

03:56:50.796 --> 03:56:52.665
of this and exposure that

03:56:52.731 --> 03:56:54.833
addition is just not acceptable

03:56:54.900 --> 03:56:56.802
we're already dealing with a

03:56:56.869 --> 03:56:58.971
lack of sufficient preparedness

03:56:59.038 --> 03:57:02.741
for individual lives. And to

03:57:02.808 --> 03:57:04.743
say that we can be prepared for

03:57:04.810 --> 03:57:06.679
a failure of the sort it's

03:57:06.745 --> 03:57:08.881
just. Not realistic and it's

03:57:08.948 --> 03:57:10.683
not going to happen in that way

03:57:10.749 --> 03:57:11.317
there's a point where you have

03:57:11.383 --> 03:57:13.018
to look at the situation and

03:57:13.085 --> 03:57:16.655
say it may have been okay.

03:57:16.722 --> 03:57:18.657
Sixty years ago forty years ago

03:57:18.724 --> 03:57:20.893
thirty years ago. Things change

03:57:20.960 --> 03:57:22.728
there's a point to move on. We

03:57:22.795 --> 03:57:24.930
need the state to move on to a

03:57:24.997 --> 03:57:26.665
new paradigm and that paradigm

03:57:26.732 --> 03:57:28.901
has to be that there is no

03:57:28.968 --> 03:57:31.070
storage facility of this type

03:57:31.136 --> 03:57:32.938
in urban areas down not

03:57:33.005 --> 03:57:36.709
compatible with urban areas.

03:57:36.775 --> 03:57:37.242
And that is the end of my

03:57:37.309 --> 03:57:40.679
comment again so appreciate

03:57:40.746 --> 03:57:41.213
your being here and so if

03:57:41.280 --> 03:57:41.814
you're if you're listening to

03:57:41.880 --> 03:57:47.019
the community. Thank you doctor

03:57:47.086 --> 03:57:48.754
not him and thank you for

03:57:48.821 --> 03:57:50.756
making the trip up to

03:57:50.823 --> 03:57:51.357
Sacramento time and time again

03:57:51.423 --> 03:57:54.860
on your own dollar. Sitting

03:57:54.927 --> 03:57:56.829
with the governor's office

03:57:56.895 --> 03:57:57.229
sitting with this

03:57:57.296 --> 03:57:58.931
administration day after day

03:57:58.998 --> 03:58:01.033
grinding it out waiting and

03:58:01.100 --> 03:58:03.268
doing it with credibility and

03:58:03.335 --> 03:58:05.170
respect amidst outrage thank

03:58:05.237 --> 03:58:12.978
you Sir. Welcome. Hi my name's

03:58:13.045 --> 03:58:15.147
doctrine or della I was the

03:58:15.214 --> 03:58:16.782
doctor that was terminated okay

03:58:16.849 --> 03:58:18.884
for doing the studies and I

03:58:18.951 --> 03:58:19.551
just want to let this committee

03:58:19.618 --> 03:58:21.153
knows first of all thank you

03:58:21.220 --> 03:58:24.757
second of all a full report is

03:58:24.823 --> 03:58:27.026
in due diligence right now

03:58:27.092 --> 03:58:30.829
exposing all of the chemicals

03:58:30.896 --> 03:58:31.430
that we know of and all of

03:58:31.497 --> 03:58:35.034
their health risk including

03:58:35.100 --> 03:58:37.002
phase one phase two hair

03:58:37.069 --> 03:58:38.871
testing urinalysis for VOCs as

03:58:38.937 --> 03:58:42.908
well as the CBC's study. That

03:58:42.975 --> 03:58:44.877
were able to obtain. So I sat

03:58:44.943 --> 03:58:48.881
there very quietly. And listen

03:58:48.947 --> 03:58:49.415
to the testimony from the

03:58:49.481 --> 03:58:51.250
department of public health and

03:58:51.316 --> 03:58:52.985
I just have to tell you right

03:58:53.052 --> 03:58:53.619
now that that is absolutely not

03:58:53.686 --> 03:58:57.122
forthright. It will be all

03:58:57.189 --> 03:59:00.993
revealed in this report. The

03:59:01.060 --> 03:59:04.863
report will be made public. And

03:59:04.930 --> 03:59:07.099
the report will be made public

03:59:07.166 --> 03:59:07.733
all not only on it in a digital

03:59:07.800 --> 03:59:11.070
format but also. In regards to

03:59:11.136 --> 03:59:13.238
a town hall that will be

03:59:13.305 --> 03:59:15.107
presented on September

03:59:15.174 --> 03:59:18.877
fourteenth ask Alex may gray.

03:59:18.944 --> 03:59:21.180
**** where it will be and what

03:59:21.246 --> 03:59:23.248
time and we will go over the

03:59:23.315 --> 03:59:26.985
conditions of benzene exposure

03:59:27.052 --> 03:59:27.586
and that's just one little

03:59:27.653 --> 03:59:29.288
thing I want to touch on. As I

03:59:29.354 --> 03:59:32.825
listen to Dr Rangan a medical

03:59:32.891 --> 03:59:33.325
toxicologist and I was a

03:59:33.392 --> 03:59:36.829
graduate from UC San Diego and

03:59:36.895 --> 03:59:37.396
UCLA school of medicine and

03:59:37.463 --> 03:59:38.831
trained in three residencies.

03:59:38.897 --> 03:59:41.066
It is not forthright that his

03:59:41.133 --> 03:59:43.001
testimony talks about somebody

03:59:43.068 --> 03:59:44.903
pumping gasoline at a gas

03:59:44.970 --> 03:59:47.106
station. First of all we a sets

03:59:47.172 --> 03:59:50.843
the standards Ford has chronic

03:59:50.909 --> 03:59:53.178
exposure eight hour exposure

03:59:53.245 --> 03:59:55.180
and one hour acute exposure now

03:59:55.247 --> 03:59:56.949
I don't know when you know

03:59:57.015 --> 03:59:57.516
southern California I don't

03:59:57.583 --> 03:59:58.951
know anybody that stands there

03:59:59.017 --> 04:00:00.953
breezy enough gasoline fumes

04:00:01.019 --> 04:00:03.155
for an hour. At a pulp that

04:00:03.222 --> 04:00:05.224
then runs into their doctor and

04:00:05.290 --> 04:00:07.025
says test the benzene level and

04:00:07.092 --> 04:00:09.194
that's not even the issue

04:00:09.261 --> 04:00:13.232
anyways the issue is that these

04:00:13.298 --> 04:00:17.169
gentlemen. Our smart they're

04:00:17.236 --> 04:00:17.669
intelligent they're well

04:00:17.736 --> 04:00:18.137
educated. But yet they

04:00:18.203 --> 04:00:20.839
testified like they're not. And

04:00:20.906 --> 04:00:21.473
that is wrong then it usually

04:00:21.540 --> 04:00:23.208
means there's another venue

04:00:23.275 --> 04:00:25.244
been seen by the way just so

04:00:25.310 --> 04:00:27.012
everybody knows if you were

04:00:27.079 --> 04:00:29.014
exposed to benzene alone and

04:00:29.081 --> 04:00:30.983
not in a poly toxin situation

04:00:31.049 --> 04:00:31.583
the majority of time it causes

04:00:31.650 --> 04:00:35.187
no symptoms. So why would we be

04:00:35.254 --> 04:00:35.754
looking at that for clinical

04:00:35.821 --> 04:00:39.024
evaluation. Absolutely makes no

04:00:39.091 --> 04:00:41.126
sense he's just one small point

04:00:41.193 --> 04:00:43.228
though all be listed in your

04:00:43.295 --> 04:00:43.829
report that you can hopefully

04:00:43.896 --> 04:00:46.999
take to the governor. And

04:00:47.065 --> 04:00:47.599
hopefully stand on the podium

04:00:47.666 --> 04:00:48.167
of the health effects of the

04:00:48.233 --> 04:00:54.873
community. Thank you. Thank you

04:00:54.940 --> 04:00:57.376
Dr Dallas I would like to think

04:00:57.442 --> 04:00:58.911
doctrine or della for being the

04:00:58.977 --> 04:01:00.846
one physician who I know of in

04:01:00.913 --> 04:01:01.313
this community who is

04:01:01.380 --> 04:01:02.948
consistently puts patients

04:01:03.015 --> 04:01:05.184
first and the care and what

04:01:05.250 --> 04:01:07.019
data collection he was able to

04:01:07.085 --> 04:01:08.854
gather before being severed

04:01:08.921 --> 04:01:09.521
from his position and he he has

04:01:09.588 --> 04:01:11.290
done yeoman's work with the

04:01:11.356 --> 04:01:13.025
data he was able to gather

04:01:13.091 --> 04:01:14.860
through a lot of means that

04:01:14.927 --> 04:01:15.460
most of us in the links that

04:01:15.527 --> 04:01:17.229
many physicians would not have.

04:01:17.296 --> 04:01:17.830
Gone to get that set thank you

04:01:17.896 --> 04:01:23.135
doctor not alone. I spoke

04:01:23.202 --> 04:01:23.769
before just five seconds have

04:01:23.836 --> 04:01:25.270
you considered how the opposite

04:01:25.337 --> 04:01:27.105
era California Attorney General

04:01:27.172 --> 04:01:29.141
for getting the reports. We'll

04:01:29.208 --> 04:01:29.641
we'll we'll take that in

04:01:29.708 --> 04:01:33.011
consideration thank you. Are we

04:01:33.078 --> 04:01:33.612
gonna make another five second

04:01:33.679 --> 04:01:37.416
exception. So we are going to

04:01:37.482 --> 04:01:38.016
try to limit it to people who

04:01:38.083 --> 04:01:39.451
haven't spoken yet okay do you

04:01:39.518 --> 04:01:41.453
want to speak yeah do you mind

04:01:41.520 --> 04:01:41.987
having others who haven't

04:01:42.054 --> 04:01:45.157
spoken yet. Thank you ask a

04:01:45.224 --> 04:01:47.192
question after okay okay we can

04:01:47.259 --> 04:01:49.228
do that after thank you

04:01:49.294 --> 04:01:51.330
welcome. Walker fully senior

04:01:51.396 --> 04:01:53.332
organizer food water action I

04:01:53.398 --> 04:01:55.467
don't have too much to say that

04:01:55.534 --> 04:01:57.469
my colleague has already I just

04:01:57.536 --> 04:01:59.304
wanted to share something

04:01:59.371 --> 04:02:03.041
anecdotal with you last year I

04:02:03.108 --> 04:02:03.609
fundraised foreign built an

04:02:03.675 --> 04:02:05.344
independent effort to help this

04:02:05.410 --> 04:02:07.412
community make sure that Katie

04:02:07.479 --> 04:02:09.081
hill is represented by their

04:02:09.147 --> 04:02:11.383
ballots we got absolutely no

04:02:11.450 --> 04:02:13.151
help from Steve night when he

04:02:13.218 --> 04:02:15.087
was in Congress and I'm very

04:02:15.153 --> 04:02:17.089
thankful to see Katie hill

04:02:17.155 --> 04:02:19.258
staff out here representing us

04:02:19.324 --> 04:02:21.193
here and in Congress. My campus

04:02:21.260 --> 04:02:23.228
is in that effort all got sick.

04:02:23.295 --> 04:02:25.330
Knocking on doors in Porter

04:02:25.397 --> 04:02:25.898
ranch it was an extensive

04:02:25.964 --> 04:02:27.366
effort we wanted to calm the

04:02:27.432 --> 04:02:29.067
community five times and

04:02:29.134 --> 04:02:31.069
guarantee that we were able to

04:02:31.136 --> 04:02:33.272
at least turn out a thousand

04:02:33.338 --> 04:02:35.140
votes. For miss Hale. And I

04:02:35.207 --> 04:02:39.011
didn't even think. On the first

04:02:39.077 --> 04:02:39.611
day because I figured Ambien

04:02:39.678 --> 04:02:41.413
exposure or you know we'll be

04:02:41.480 --> 04:02:43.215
moving around. It's a big

04:02:43.282 --> 04:02:47.185
environment will be fine but

04:02:47.252 --> 04:02:47.819
reports started coming in over

04:02:47.886 --> 04:02:49.254
but the tax threat that. People

04:02:49.321 --> 04:02:51.356
were starting to taste metal in

04:02:51.423 --> 04:02:51.990
their mouth they were starting

04:02:52.057 --> 04:02:55.160
to get headaches. And I myself

04:02:55.227 --> 04:02:57.062
after awhile was unable to

04:02:57.129 --> 04:02:57.729
think straight anymore and that

04:02:57.796 --> 04:02:59.598
was just from two to three

04:02:59.665 --> 04:03:01.233
hours of walking around in the

04:03:01.300 --> 04:03:03.135
community last year. Around

04:03:03.201 --> 04:03:07.372
November. I note that it's not

04:03:07.439 --> 04:03:09.408
lost on some of the people on

04:03:09.474 --> 04:03:09.975
this panel that the health

04:03:10.042 --> 04:03:11.109
issues are ongoing this

04:03:11.176 --> 04:03:13.145
facility is a persistent threat

04:03:13.211 --> 04:03:15.213
to this community it is not

04:03:15.280 --> 04:03:17.282
just a threat to people who've

04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:19.084
been chronically exposed but to

04:03:19.151 --> 04:03:19.751
people who are even up here for

04:03:19.818 --> 04:03:21.320
a few hours at a time most of

04:03:21.386 --> 04:03:23.455
the folks who were canvassing

04:03:23.522 --> 04:03:25.023
with us were in their twenties

04:03:25.090 --> 04:03:27.025
to early thirties otherwise

04:03:27.092 --> 04:03:29.161
healthy individuals with no.

04:03:29.227 --> 04:03:29.761
Health complications to speak

04:03:29.828 --> 04:03:31.430
up and they all got ill within

04:03:31.496 --> 04:03:33.165
a matter of hours we had to cut

04:03:33.231 --> 04:03:35.033
our campus is short not just on

04:03:35.100 --> 04:03:37.135
one day but on several days

04:03:37.202 --> 04:03:37.703
through the course of the

04:03:37.769 --> 04:03:39.404
operation and I just wanted to

04:03:39.471 --> 04:03:41.506
report that it is. Still very

04:03:41.573 --> 04:03:43.208
much a threat to folks up here.

04:03:43.275 --> 04:03:47.346
Thank you Mr Foley. Welcome

04:03:47.412 --> 04:03:49.414
good afternoon hi my name's

04:03:49.481 --> 04:03:53.185
Vicki Selma. I when I

04:03:53.251 --> 04:03:55.253
personally thank senator stern

04:03:55.320 --> 04:03:59.257
and congresswoman Smith. For

04:03:59.324 --> 04:04:03.228
listening to us and especially

04:04:03.295 --> 04:04:07.232
I'm sorry the rank and left. I

04:04:07.299 --> 04:04:09.134
couldn't hear but those of us

04:04:09.201 --> 04:04:11.336
still have to say because and

04:04:11.403 --> 04:04:13.271
I'm thank you for. Hard

04:04:13.338 --> 04:04:17.342
questioning him. The county

04:04:17.409 --> 04:04:21.113
health department did fail us

04:04:21.179 --> 04:04:25.183
so many times. Many times. I

04:04:25.250 --> 04:04:25.717
was forced out of my home

04:04:25.784 --> 04:04:27.753
permanently. I drove a hundred

04:04:27.819 --> 04:04:33.158
fifty miles here. Be here today.

04:04:33.225 --> 04:04:37.129
Each way big as I'm still sick

04:04:37.195 --> 04:04:37.629
at I don't know what to

04:04:37.696 --> 04:04:39.231
permanent or not and I. My I

04:04:39.297 --> 04:04:43.201
have an environmental Dr. And

04:04:43.268 --> 04:04:43.835
he does not agree with Rankin.

04:04:43.902 --> 04:04:49.574
And. I tested right after that

04:04:49.641 --> 04:04:51.510
well it was killed and many of

04:04:51.576 --> 04:04:53.478
the things that have come up

04:04:53.545 --> 04:04:55.213
positive and I also did Dr

04:04:55.280 --> 04:04:57.282
north Dallas test and the

04:04:57.349 --> 04:04:57.849
between the two of them if

04:04:57.916 --> 04:04:59.584
you're smart and you look at it

04:04:59.651 --> 04:05:01.586
you can figure out they had to

04:05:01.653 --> 04:05:03.588
have come from here including

04:05:03.655 --> 04:05:07.325
machinery bits and the heavy

04:05:07.392 --> 04:05:09.227
metals and everything the

04:05:09.294 --> 04:05:11.163
county health departments

04:05:11.229 --> 04:05:11.696
protocol for cleaning. Was

04:05:11.763 --> 04:05:15.233
horrible. I came back I was

04:05:15.300 --> 04:05:17.436
sicker than before I left. And

04:05:17.502 --> 04:05:19.504
I was pretty tired sick and so

04:05:19.571 --> 04:05:21.573
was my dog immediately vomiting

04:05:21.640 --> 04:05:23.542
as soon as we got back in the

04:05:23.608 --> 04:05:25.343
home I called I emailed.

04:05:25.410 --> 04:05:29.147
Everybody I knew especially in

04:05:29.214 --> 04:05:29.748
the county health department.

04:05:29.815 --> 04:05:33.318
And nobody responded I couldn't

04:05:33.385 --> 04:05:35.353
stay there. I was I was just.

04:05:35.420 --> 04:05:39.291
Deathly ill so I left and it

04:05:39.357 --> 04:05:41.159
took two weeks for the county

04:05:41.226 --> 04:05:41.827
health department to respond to

04:05:41.893 --> 04:05:45.163
me can we come over and

04:05:45.230 --> 04:05:45.764
interview your home I said are

04:05:45.831 --> 04:05:49.568
you nuts. I'm so sick I had to

04:05:49.634 --> 04:05:53.171
get out again. I couldn't stay

04:05:53.238 --> 04:05:55.407
in my home it was worse. Than

04:05:55.474 --> 04:05:57.342
before the cleaning. They did

04:05:57.409 --> 04:05:59.344
and they the county came and

04:05:59.411 --> 04:06:01.513
the cleaners were not following

04:06:01.580 --> 04:06:03.381
the protocol and there were no

04:06:03.448 --> 04:06:05.317
consequences. Not no

04:06:05.383 --> 04:06:07.352
consequences of ever been

04:06:07.419 --> 04:06:09.588
happen. To anybody who has done

04:06:09.654 --> 04:06:11.223
something wrong the government.

04:06:11.289 --> 04:06:13.625
Through everything the promises

04:06:13.692 --> 04:06:15.427
nobody in this community has

04:06:15.494 --> 04:06:19.364
gotten us angled dime yet.

04:06:19.431 --> 04:06:19.998
After four years we haven't had

04:06:20.065 --> 04:06:23.401
anybody. My eyes my

04:06:23.468 --> 04:06:24.002
environmental doctor did test

04:06:24.069 --> 04:06:29.741
me. And he had a very good way

04:06:29.808 --> 04:06:33.411
of proving. That it came from a

04:06:33.478 --> 04:06:35.547
lease out. And I could go live

04:06:35.614 --> 04:06:37.582
at a gas station he said if I

04:06:37.649 --> 04:06:39.518
wanted and then you get

04:06:39.584 --> 04:06:41.353
retested and we were so

04:06:41.419 --> 04:06:41.920
convinced that the numbers

04:06:41.987 --> 04:06:43.655
would drop and so many of the

04:06:43.722 --> 04:06:47.392
things that were found how do

04:06:47.459 --> 04:06:47.926
I. Even if we don't have a

04:06:47.993 --> 04:06:51.363
complete list which we need. I

04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.930
had to have come from there

04:06:51.997 --> 04:06:55.367
there's no other way. It

04:06:55.433 --> 04:06:57.469
doesn't all come from a gas

04:06:57.536 --> 04:06:59.304
station. And it's just

04:06:59.371 --> 04:07:01.373
insulting it's insulting other

04:07:01.439 --> 04:07:03.508
Caryl department did not come

04:07:03.575 --> 04:07:05.544
through I was one of the ones

04:07:05.610 --> 04:07:07.312
that. Daily filed complaints.

04:07:07.379 --> 04:07:09.548
Even on my animals I talked to

04:07:09.614 --> 04:07:10.148
the county health departments

04:07:10.215 --> 04:07:13.818
vets. They said well it's the

04:07:13.885 --> 04:07:15.487
symptom occurred before the

04:07:15.554 --> 04:07:16.087
blow out we're not considering

04:07:16.154 --> 04:07:17.656
it was our job basically thrown

04:07:17.722 --> 04:07:19.424
in the circular file. That is

04:07:19.491 --> 04:07:21.359
so wrong now that we know the

04:07:21.426 --> 04:07:21.960
RCA we all knew what was going

04:07:22.027 --> 04:07:25.297
on before it. We just needed

04:07:25.363 --> 04:07:25.931
some proof and then they go and

04:07:25.997 --> 04:07:27.766
open it before the RCA. But now

04:07:27.832 --> 04:07:31.636
we know. And they threw all

04:07:31.703 --> 04:07:32.204
that evidence away from our

04:07:32.270 --> 04:07:35.674
reports. So what my dog is

04:07:35.740 --> 04:07:37.475
vomiting right. Massively

04:07:37.542 --> 04:07:39.511
during the blow out because we

04:07:39.578 --> 04:07:40.111
weren't notified and we were

04:07:40.178 --> 04:07:43.315
outside. She was sick before

04:07:43.381 --> 04:07:45.317
too and so are my other animals

04:07:45.383 --> 04:07:47.285
why fish were sick during that

04:07:47.352 --> 04:07:49.621
blow out. If they they didn't

04:07:49.688 --> 04:07:51.456
check the vet didn't care.

04:07:51.523 --> 04:07:51.990
Nobody the county health

04:07:52.057 --> 04:07:53.491
department carriage and I went

04:07:53.558 --> 04:07:55.594
up the ladder and I went and I

04:07:55.660 --> 04:07:59.564
went to the supervisors. I went

04:07:59.631 --> 04:08:01.466
to everybody pleading for help.

04:08:01.533 --> 04:08:03.435
Even during evacuation. It took

04:08:03.501 --> 04:08:04.035
them two months to get me out

04:08:04.102 --> 04:08:07.639
here. With their it was

04:08:07.706 --> 04:08:09.541
horrible so thank you. For

04:08:09.608 --> 04:08:11.610
questioning him thank you for

04:08:11.676 --> 04:08:12.143
listening please go to the

04:08:12.210 --> 04:08:17.716
governor. I helped as much as I

04:08:17.782 --> 04:08:19.384
could get you guys voted in and

04:08:19.451 --> 04:08:21.686
I am very proud of how you

04:08:21.753 --> 04:08:23.855
stood up to doctor rang in

04:08:23.922 --> 04:08:24.422
today. Consonants mess thank

04:08:24.489 --> 04:08:25.890

04:08:25.957 --> 04:08:31.830
vote. And he's just we need to

eyesight. I can't even imagine.

04:12:59.664 --> 04:13:01.799
one issue that I didn't hear

04:13:01.866 --> 04:13:05.637
come up that I'd like you to.

04:13:05.703 --> 04:13:06.271
Maybe talk about or think about

04:13:06.337 --> 04:13:09.641
is this pipeline outage issue.

04:13:09.707 --> 04:13:10.241
Because I think that's one of

04:13:10.308 --> 04:13:12.277
the ways that they're trying to

04:13:12.343 --> 04:13:15.647
justify keeping it open but I

04:13:15.713 --> 04:13:17.615
know you guys are on it and

04:13:17.682 --> 04:13:19.784
once again thank you we always

04:13:19.851 --> 04:13:21.786
welcome you here in Porter

04:13:21.853 --> 04:13:23.721
ranch with open arms. So much

04:13:23.788 --> 04:13:25.657
appreciated thank you Mr actor.

04:13:25.723 --> 04:13:31.896
Okay. My name is Jason Adleman

04:13:31.963 --> 04:13:33.932
I've lived here eleven years

04:13:33.998 --> 04:13:37.835
when I moved in. I smelled gas

04:13:37.902 --> 04:13:39.871
I called the gas company and

04:13:39.938 --> 04:13:40.405
they came out and checked

04:13:40.471 --> 04:13:41.806
everything everything was okay.

04:13:41.873 --> 04:13:44.008
We in America I respect the

04:13:44.075 --> 04:13:45.944
police fire department

04:13:46.010 --> 04:13:47.946
everybody that saves us helps

04:13:48.012 --> 04:13:50.081
us and especially the

04:13:50.148 --> 04:13:53.785
politicians. We live on trust.

04:13:53.851 --> 04:13:57.789
And we trusted that a utility

04:13:57.855 --> 04:13:58.423
company would let us know right

04:13:58.489 --> 04:14:01.793
away. So we could evacuate not

04:14:01.859 --> 04:14:05.763
a leak I thought it was a leak.

04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:08.099
The utility company didn't even

04:14:08.166 --> 04:14:10.134
follow the law to report it to

04:14:10.201 --> 04:14:15.707
the fire department. After six

04:14:15.773 --> 04:14:16.341
months it was deemed we need to

04:14:16.407 --> 04:14:21.980
move. By the time that happened

04:14:22.046 --> 04:14:23.948
all the houses were gone. Where

04:14:24.015 --> 04:14:26.150
my gonna go it took two months

04:14:26.217 --> 04:14:27.952
to find a place I couldn't

04:14:28.019 --> 04:14:31.823
bring my dogs to the new place.

04:14:31.889 --> 04:14:32.423
And they complained I had to

04:14:32.490 --> 04:14:35.960
move back to my house. No one

04:14:36.027 --> 04:14:38.129
in this room knows what it's

04:14:38.196 --> 04:14:40.131
like to wake up in the middle

04:14:40.198 --> 04:14:41.866
of the night when you have no

04:14:41.933 --> 04:14:43.768
air conditioning the windows

04:14:43.835 --> 04:14:44.369
are all open. In your choking

04:14:44.435 --> 04:14:51.809
from the- gas. My house I'm so

04:14:51.876 --> 04:14:52.410
close to it I'm like a wind

04:14:52.477 --> 04:14:55.813
sock for it all I'm asking is

04:14:55.880 --> 04:14:57.815
the trust that everybody in

04:14:57.882 --> 04:14:59.951
this room has towards

04:15:00.018 --> 04:15:02.020
politicians in the respect is

04:15:02.086 --> 04:15:05.857
to just take this before your

04:15:05.923 --> 04:15:07.792
people. And have it shut down.

04:15:07.859 --> 04:15:10.061
You guys got to live with

04:15:10.128 --> 04:15:12.130
yourself twenty years from now

04:15:12.196 --> 04:15:13.898
if something happens. You're

04:15:13.965 --> 04:15:17.935
going to say I tried thank you

04:15:18.002 --> 04:15:20.038
for going up against a multi

04:15:20.104 --> 04:15:23.808
billion dollar corporation.

04:15:23.875 --> 04:15:25.977
That has a lot of this and

04:15:26.044 --> 04:15:27.945
people's pockets I'm just

04:15:28.012 --> 04:15:30.114
asking for the trust of a

04:15:30.181 --> 04:15:33.885
retired old man. That has

04:15:33.951 --> 04:15:35.853
asthma and trying to live out

04:15:35.920 --> 04:15:37.955
our lives in thank you so much

04:15:38.022 --> 04:15:40.024
for all of the people. Nurses

04:15:40.091 --> 04:15:43.895
fire department police we don't

04:15:43.961 --> 04:15:44.529
thank them enough they're the

04:15:44.595 --> 04:15:45.930
first ones that come in. Thank

04:15:45.997 --> 04:15:55.773
you so much. Thank you Sir. Hi

04:15:55.840 --> 04:15:56.407
my name is Karen Hughes I've

04:15:56.474 --> 04:15:58.242
lived here will be seven years

04:15:58.309 --> 04:16:01.913
soon I have no idea when I

04:16:01.979 --> 04:16:03.881
moved here that there was even

04:16:03.948 --> 04:16:04.382
up there because nobody

04:16:04.449 --> 04:16:06.250
disclosed that I think now I

04:16:06.317 --> 04:16:09.787
try to sell have to disclose it

04:16:09.854 --> 04:16:12.123
I happen to be a little dog and

04:16:12.190 --> 04:16:15.793
I happen to be at the park

04:16:15.860 --> 04:16:16.394
right down here. When it blew

04:16:16.461 --> 04:16:20.131
out. Timing I got out of my car

04:16:20.198 --> 04:16:20.665
and thought what is that

04:16:20.732 --> 04:16:22.166
terrible smell. I walked the

04:16:22.233 --> 04:16:24.268
dog I went back and told my

04:16:24.335 --> 04:16:26.237
neighbors there's something

04:16:26.304 --> 04:16:28.272
going on and they're like no

04:16:28.339 --> 04:16:30.208
you can never smelled gas it

04:16:30.274 --> 04:16:32.043
can't be a gas leak and one

04:16:32.110 --> 04:16:34.378
okay. So needless to say again

04:16:34.445 --> 04:16:36.280
I missed the I just basically

04:16:36.347 --> 04:16:38.349
got here so I'm not sure what

04:16:38.416 --> 04:16:40.118
was discussed but- I believe

04:16:40.184 --> 04:16:41.819
they held off on telling

04:16:41.886 --> 04:16:46.057
everybody for awhile. I have

04:16:46.124 --> 04:16:49.927
never smoked in my life. On the

04:16:49.994 --> 04:16:50.528
block never had any of those

04:16:50.595 --> 04:16:54.165
issues. I within. Well a couple

04:16:54.232 --> 04:16:55.900
weeks I started coughing a lot

04:16:55.967 --> 04:16:57.902
had nose bleeds I had

04:16:57.969 --> 04:17:00.071
headaches. The most annoying

04:17:00.138 --> 04:17:02.106
thing was every time I went

04:17:02.173 --> 04:17:02.740
outside my eyes wouldn't stop

04:17:02.807 --> 04:17:05.843
tearing. But you know I thought.

04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:08.279
Whatever because no one knew

04:17:08.346 --> 04:17:10.181
how bad this was so I kept

04:17:10.248 --> 04:17:13.918
living here and finally in

04:17:13.985 --> 04:17:15.920
January I was diagnosed with

04:17:15.987 --> 04:17:16.587
asthma never ever had as smoke.

04:17:16.654 --> 04:17:20.158
Before my physician insisted

04:17:20.224 --> 04:17:21.959
that I get relocated which I

04:17:22.026 --> 04:17:24.162
did in a couple weeks I believe

04:17:24.228 --> 04:17:27.999
after. The I called them. So

04:17:28.065 --> 04:17:30.168
relocated within about a week

04:17:30.234 --> 04:17:34.005
or so to yes No went away. And

04:17:34.071 --> 04:17:36.040
that you know I stayed there

04:17:36.107 --> 04:17:36.674
till they capped it and came

04:17:36.741 --> 04:17:40.077
back home and I guess I really

04:17:40.144 --> 04:17:42.213
didn't. React the way I should

04:17:42.280 --> 04:17:44.148
have I didn't like about the

04:17:44.215 --> 04:17:45.917
carpeting do all the things

04:17:45.983 --> 04:17:46.417
that a lot of people did

04:17:46.484 --> 04:17:48.286
because I still didn't think

04:17:48.352 --> 04:17:50.188
well it can't be that bad you

04:17:50.254 --> 04:17:53.991
know. And then in. April of

04:17:54.058 --> 04:17:56.294
last year twenty eighteen I was

04:17:56.360 --> 04:17:58.062
diagnosed with breast cancer

04:17:58.129 --> 04:18:00.131
and I there's no cancer

04:18:00.198 --> 04:18:04.001
anywhere in my family no where.

04:18:04.068 --> 04:18:06.170
After three surgeries radiation

04:18:06.237 --> 04:18:09.941
chemotherapy you know I'm still

04:18:10.007 --> 04:18:13.945
here but you know it just you

04:18:14.011 --> 04:18:14.512
know when I'm not obviously

04:18:14.579 --> 04:18:20.117
young. But I am going to

04:18:20.184 --> 04:18:21.953
continue living. As long as I

04:18:22.019 --> 04:18:22.587
can but you know I really worry

04:18:22.653 --> 04:18:24.222
about all this kids god only

04:18:24.288 --> 04:18:26.557
knows what they're going to be

04:18:26.624 --> 04:18:30.027
developing. You know as they go

04:18:30.094 --> 04:18:30.661
on through life especially if

04:18:30.728 --> 04:18:34.265
this place continues. To you

04:18:34.332 --> 04:18:42.039
know. Do what they do. So you

04:18:42.106 --> 04:18:42.607
know I ask and I guess I've

04:18:42.673 --> 04:18:43.174
heard a lot of people would

04:18:43.241 --> 04:18:43.741
come up here while I've been

04:18:43.808 --> 04:18:44.408
sitting here said you guys have

04:18:44.475 --> 04:18:45.009
been very wrists supportive.

04:18:45.076 --> 04:18:46.277
But I just wanna let you know

04:18:46.344 --> 04:18:48.312
that. I truly think no cancer

04:18:48.379 --> 04:18:52.116
anywhere in my family anywhere

04:18:52.183 --> 04:18:54.018
any side any peace person any

04:18:54.085 --> 04:18:56.187
type of cancer not even skin

04:18:56.254 --> 04:18:56.687
cancer. That there is a

04:18:56.754 --> 04:19:00.224
connection. So okay thank you

04:19:00.291 --> 04:19:00.791
thank you for your testimony

04:19:00.858 --> 04:19:05.963
ma'am. Thank you and I know

04:19:06.030 --> 04:19:08.099
you'll give it just a thirty

04:19:08.165 --> 04:19:08.733
second right I'm just gonna get

04:19:08.799 --> 04:19:12.136
one question. Basically because

04:19:12.203 --> 04:19:14.038
in honor of my of a loved one

04:19:14.105 --> 04:19:14.639
who just been diagnosed with

04:19:14.705 --> 04:19:18.276
lymphoma and been seen as one

04:19:18.342 --> 04:19:20.311
of the causes of up look almost

04:19:20.378 --> 04:19:22.413
so on behalf of him since even

04:19:22.480 --> 04:19:26.183
the Reagans no longer here we

04:19:26.250 --> 04:19:28.252
want to know if. The LA county

04:19:28.319 --> 04:19:30.521
public health or the state

04:19:30.588 --> 04:19:32.323
department of public health has

04:19:32.390 --> 04:19:34.425
blocked labs from giving

04:19:34.492 --> 04:19:36.327
information to doctor no

04:19:36.394 --> 04:19:38.229
delicacies aspirin labs you

04:19:38.296 --> 04:19:38.763
probably heard about this

04:19:38.829 --> 04:19:40.298
lawsuit and we think that

04:19:40.364 --> 04:19:44.035
that's a big possibility and

04:19:44.101 --> 04:19:46.237
he's he's going to set all this

04:19:46.304 --> 04:19:46.871
information but he wanted more

04:19:46.938 --> 04:19:48.272
doubt itself that's something

04:19:48.339 --> 04:19:50.141
that maybe on if you have any

04:19:50.207 --> 04:19:50.775
follow ups with doctor Reagan.

04:19:50.841 --> 04:19:52.176
Or the county or the state

04:19:52.243 --> 04:19:58.115

and he said there's a world

04:20:06.824 --> 04:20:08.159
right now. That is having

04:20:08.225 --> 04:20:08.793
problems they're having complex

04:20:08.859 --> 04:20:09.360
issues with a to cap it for

04:20:09.427 --> 04:20:10.594
less. Two three ones. And that

04:20:10.661 --> 04:20:12.263
to me is another boat because

04:20:12.330 --> 04:20:14.632
last few months if you go on

04:20:14.699 --> 04:20:16.400
ghastly page people have been

04:20:16.467 --> 04:20:17.001
saying that you're sick you

04:20:17.068 --> 04:20:18.336
have symptoms. Sicker than

04:20:18.402 --> 04:20:20.471
before. And I can tell you he

04:20:20.538 --> 04:20:22.606
said he doesn't know about the

04:20:22.673 --> 04:20:23.140
religious I can tell you

04:20:23.207 --> 04:20:26.143
exactly what it is. It's east

04:20:26.210 --> 04:20:28.079
to the east of the facility

04:20:28.145 --> 04:20:28.646
because if you come in at

04:20:28.713 --> 04:20:32.283
night. You see so many lights

04:20:32.350 --> 04:20:32.817
there it's more than the

04:20:32.883 --> 04:20:34.485
football you know that there's

04:20:34.552 --> 04:20:36.287
this whole bright. And they're

04:20:36.354 --> 04:20:38.356
working on that they have been

04:20:38.422 --> 04:20:40.157
working on it for last two

04:20:40.224 --> 04:20:42.093
months this is another blow up

04:20:42.159 --> 04:20:42.626
so it's not like. What if

04:20:42.693 --> 04:20:50.334
something else. Is going to

04:20:50.401 --> 04:20:50.901
happen is happening. That's

04:20:50.968 --> 04:20:54.305
what you see here. One other

04:20:54.372 --> 04:20:56.307
thing the doctor. Talk about

04:20:56.374 --> 04:20:58.109
this. A test them for lawsuit

04:20:58.175 --> 04:20:58.709
and all that I wanted to know

04:20:58.776 --> 04:21:02.146
what's in my daughter's body so

04:21:02.213 --> 04:21:02.747
quick detox which so she could

04:21:02.813 --> 04:21:06.384
detox. Never given that

04:21:06.450 --> 04:21:06.984
information up to this point.

04:21:38.249 --> 04:21:40.284
invite officials to appear

04:21:40.351 --> 04:21:42.253
before us to appear before this

04:21:42.319 --> 04:21:42.853
community until the issue is

04:21:42.920 --> 04:21:44.522
finally resolved in this

04:21:44.588 --> 04:21:46.157

realize that that is not easy.

04:21:50.361 --> 04:21:52.229
We think the officials who are

04:21:52.296 --> 04:21:54.265
here testifying today we hope

04:21:54.331 --> 04:21:56.267

but the beginning in the end

04:22:00.905 --> 04:22:02.473
you understand. The depth of

04:22:02.540 --> 04:22:04.675
concern that we have for this

04:22:04.742 --> 04:22:08.212

Of this room and having these

04:22:08.879 --> 04:22:10.481
conversations in the very

04:22:10.548 --> 04:22:14.218
sterile Sacramento setting.

sitting and listening the P.

04:23:30.594 --> 04:23:32.229
you see our county folks

04:23:32.296 --> 04:23:32.830
everybody. You know there's a

04:23:32.897 --> 04:23:36.500
lot of talk about. What a

04:23:36.567 --> 04:23:37.101
transition away from fossil

04:23:37.168 --> 04:23:40.471
fuels looks like and how how

04:23:40.538 --> 04:23:42.606
pie in the sky and impossible

04:23:42.673 --> 04:23:43.240
some of these dreams are that

04:23:43.307 --> 04:23:46.510
we have of a- of a- of a green

04:23:46.577 --> 04:23:48.479
new deal of a future that. That

04:23:48.546 --> 04:23:50.681
doesn't make people sick and

04:23:50.748 --> 04:23:52.716
you know you don't need to look

04:23:52.783 --> 04:23:54.385
any further than just walking

04:23:54.451 --> 04:23:55.019
out these doors and looking up

04:23:55.085 --> 04:23:58.322
on that hill side to realize

04:23:58.389 --> 04:24:00.391
that there is a- a better way

04:24:00.457 --> 04:24:02.326
and if you can picture a future

04:24:02.393 --> 04:24:04.328
where that hill side is not

04:24:04.395 --> 04:24:06.564
full of gas and oil. And toxic

04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:08.599
chemicals that could make us

04:24:08.666 --> 04:24:10.734
sick. But a clean energy

04:24:10.801 --> 04:24:14.605
storage facility with solar and

04:24:14.672 --> 04:24:18.542
wind and batteries to fuel our

04:24:18.609 --> 04:24:20.444
community so that even the next

04:24:20.511 --> 04:24:24.348
earthquake. There still power

04:24:24.415 --> 04:24:26.584
on because the power doesn't

04:24:26.650 --> 04:24:32.323
shut down when the gas did we

04:24:32.389 --> 04:24:36.327
wouldn't be relying on this gas

04:24:36.393 --> 04:24:44.335
field and so for all the

04:24:44.401 --> 04:24:52.643
criticisms. In dollar bill

04:24:52.710 --> 04:24:54.712
coming your way if you don't

04:24:54.778 --> 04:24:55.312
thank you all this meeting is
